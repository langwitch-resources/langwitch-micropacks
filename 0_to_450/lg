No chance of that here.	Tewali mukisa gwa ekyo wano.
I wanted to get out of there, fast.	Nnali njagala okuva awo, mu bwangu.
No idea if that’s true.	Tewali kirowoozo oba ekyo kituufu.
At the wedding.	Ku mbaga.
Nothing is more complicated than that.	Tewali kintu kizibu okusinga ekyo.
I thought only of myself.	Nalowooza ku nze nzekka.
I don’t want to be here myself.	Nze kennyini saagala kubeera wano.
They certainly are.	Mazima ddala bwe bali.
He is genuinely not a very nice guy.	Mu mazima si ggaayi mulungi nnyo.
We can’t tell who or what he was.	Tetusobola kumanya ani oba yali.
I feel so sick.	Mpulira nga ndi mulwadde nnyo.
You have to win.	Olina okuwangula.
Definitely my best friend.	Mazima ddala mukwano gwange asinga.
That had to go do that now.	Ekyo yalina okugenda okukola ekyo kati.
But you are a man.	Naye ggwe oli musajja.
I'm just glad you can find the time.	Ndi musanyufu kyokka nti osobola okufuna obudde.
The plan is in place.	Enteekateeka eri mu nkola.
He didn’t really want a relationship.	Yali tayagala nnyo mukwano.
It is that, of course.	Kye ekyo, mazima ddala.
He had no idea where.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna wa.
He thought only of himself.	Yalowooza ku ye yekka.
But not for very long.	Naye si bbanga ddene nnyo.
It was the answer.	Kyali kya kuddamu.
He has a dog.	Alina embwa.
I’m sorry, but no.	Nsonyiwa naye nedda.
Actually, kid, this isn’t quite true.	Mu butuufu mwana, kino si kituufu nnyo.
I don’t think it is.	Sirowooza nti bwe kiri.
That one is really visible.	Oyo alabika ddala.
I’ll get a job.	Nja kufuna omulimu.
That was the dog.	Eyo ye yali embwa.
That way you can do whatever you want to do.	Mu ngeri eyo osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala okukola.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
No one had any money.	Tewali yalina ssente yonna.
Really quick delivery.	Ddala okutuusa amangu.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Naye ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri.
How lucky that you are okay.	Nga wa mukisa nti oli bulungi.
I can’t believe it’s mine.	Siyinza kukkiriza nti wange.
I love being with him.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye.
He felt so ready to do this.	Yawulira nga mwetegefu nnyo okukola kino.
I have a plan.	Nnina enteekateeka.
I have so much to do.	Nnina bingi nnyo bye nnina okukola.
He may still be doing that.	Ne kati ayinza okuba ng’akola ekyo.
Not his wife.	Si mukyala we.
I hope he has.	Nsuubira nti alina...
But don’t go.	Naye togenda.
The house was really nice.	Ennyumba yali nnungi ddala.
Not good without harm.	Si mulungi nga talina bulabe.
This or nothing.	Kino oba tewali.
He looked dangerous.	Yalabika nga wa bulabe.
He was very active.	Yali akola nnyo.
It is an opinion.	Ye ndowooza.
The problem is, it was us.	Obuzibu buli nti, twali ffe.
Now that is very important.	Kati ekyo kikulu nnyo.
This is very convenient and very simple.	Kino kirungi nnyo era kyangu nnyo.
I don’t want to go back to school.	Saagala kudda ku ssomero.
We cannot allow this to happen.	Kino tetusobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
It’s just too complicated.	Kizibu nnyo kyokka.
But it doesn’t matter to me.	Naye si kikulu gyendi.
That was my point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga yange.
This isn’t mine!	Kino si kyange!
Nothing was good.	Tewali kyali kirungi.
But that is not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu.
I think in this case, we’re going to be moving forward.	Ndowooza mu mbeera eno, tugenda kuba tugenda mu maaso.
I have to say it was really nice.	Nnina okugamba nti kyali kirungi nnyo ddala.
The thing you wanted was not the thing you thought you wanted.	Ekintu kye wali oyagala si kye kintu kye wali olowooza nti oyagala.
We were a man down.	Twali musajja wansi.
This is what it is!.	Kino kye kiri!.
No time for that now.	Tewali budde bwa ekyo kati.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
It’s not a bad city.	Si kibuga kibi.
There! 	Awo!
One by one.	Omu ku omu.
It’s not really an easy thing.	Mu butuufu si kintu kyangu.
It is not the case now.	Si bwe kiri kati.
However, it is very important.	Kyokka, kikulu nnyo.
That's the point.	Eyo y'ensonga.
He is real.	Ye wa ddala.
You will go to school.	Ojja kugenda ku ssomero.
I kind of like the guy.	Nze mu ngeri ya njagala ggaayi.
He didn't know what time it was.	Yali tamanyi ssaawa mmeka.
We have an office.	Tulina ofiisi.
I hope it isn’t.	Nsuubira nti si bwe kiri.
He can.	Asobola.
The food was excellent.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
But that is not easy to do.	Naye ekyo si kyangu kukikola.
But not for very long.	Naye si okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
This was a very important step.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
Not everyone can do it.	Si buli muntu nti asobola okukikola.
Now I know what it is.	Kati mmanyi kye kiri.
Why do you want to do this?	Lwaki oyagala okukola kino?
That’s always going to be true.	Ekyo bulijjo kigenda kuba kituufu.
He said it right.	Yagambye bulungi.
He was still alone.	Yali akyali yekka.
That’s what my friend told me.	Ekyo mukwano gwange kye yang’amba.
All he could do.	Byonna bye yali asobola okukola.
He just couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola kyokka.
No vision problems.	Tewali buzibu bwa kulaba.
He couldn’t tell.	Yali tasobola kumanya.
And I have a job.	Era nnina omulimu.
You knew that.	Ekyo wali okimanyi.
We have to move away from this idea.	Tulina okuva ku ndowooza eno.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
And they were, of course.	Era baali, ddala.
I am well aware of this.	Kino nkimanyi bulungi.
I want a party.	Njagala kabaga.
He has no reason.	Talina nsonga yonna.
This, to me, is problematic.	Kino, gyendi, kizibu.
But he was too young.	Naye yali muto nnyo.
It was very powerful.	Yali ya maanyi nnyo.
To do something.	Okukola ekintu.
You have to go right now.	Olina okugenda kati kati.
Perhaps he did not know himself.	Oboolyawo ye kennyini yali tamanyi.
Trouble is his best friend.	Obuzibu mukwano gwe asinga.
I am his brother.	Nze muganda we.
I feel so much better here.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo wano.
He thought he knew that now.	Yalowooza nti bw’atyo akimanyi kati.
I love to read.	Njagala nnyo okusoma.
I don’t have any money right now.	Sirina ssente yonna mu kiseera kino.
You weren’t the one.	Ggwe si gwe wali.
He spoke quickly.	Yayogera mangu.
You are here now.	Oli wano kati.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
No, just no.	Nedda, nedda kyokka.
He was my best friend at the time.	Yali mukwano gwange nnyo mu kiseera ekyo.
I hope that it is.	Nsuubira nti bwe kiri.
You have to go.	Olina okugenda.
Not that at all.	Si ekyo n’akatono.
He knows a lot about movies.	Amanyi bingi ku firimu.
And he's not here.	Era tali wano.
The only thing is.	Ekintu kyokka kiri nti.
Today everyone does everything.	Leero buli muntu akola buli kimu.
He isn’t like that.	Si bw’atyo.
I know it’s great.	Nkimanyi nti kirungi nnyo.
He is a great singer!	Ye muyimbi nnyo!
Not a little bit like that.	Si bwe kiri katono.
But now we are.	Naye kati tuli.
It’s too bad for them.	Kibi nnyo gye bali.
This is normal.	Kino kya bulijjo.
He should have known.	Yandibadde amanyi.
But he’s afraid.	Naye atya.
It doesn’t matter where.	Si kikulu wa.
He was where he was supposed to be.	Yali we yali alina okubeera.
He was nowhere to be found.	Yali talina we yali.
He really did it.	Ddala yakikola.
Now I can't speak.	Kati sisobola kwogera.
Not even from you.	Si wadde okuva gy’oli.
He’s like that.	Ye bw’atyo.
No one talked to me in the office.	Tewali yayogera nange mu ofiisi.
You could get anything.	Oyinza okufuna ekintu kyonna.
But he couldn’t do it.	Naye yali tasobola kukikola.
I like to be alone.	Njagala nnyo okubeera nzekka.
And at the time, it was a great idea.	Era mu kiseera ekyo, kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I'm afraid.	Nze ntya.
But he knows he can’t.	Naye akimanyi nti tasobola.
We’re fine.	Tuli bulungi.
I couldn’t eat.	Nnali sisobola kulya.
Each of those is important.	Buli kimu ku ebyo kikulu.
Apparently you can’t.	Kirabika tosobola.
The food was excellent.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
He won't come.	Tajja kujja.
I love the planning.	Njagala nnyo enteekateeka.
I know it and you know it.	Nze nkimanyi era naawe okimanyi.
And if he had .	Era singa yalina .
What he was.	Kye yali.
But, well.	Naye, bulungi.
As early as we can go.	Nga bukyali nga bwe tusobola okugenda.
We don’t have anything.	Tetulina kye tulina.
Right now, anyway.	Kati kati, mu ngeri yonna.
Or we were alone.	Oba twali ffekka.
To me it is mine.	Eri nze kye kyange.
Yeah, yeah.	Ye ye.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
In response.	Mu kuddamu.
Everyone has their own opinion.	Buli muntu alina endowooza ye.
This is not a matter of opinion.	Eno si nsonga ya ndowooza.
It is probably very important.	Oboolyawo kikulu nnyo.
Probably more than anyone.	Oboolyawo okusinga omuntu yenna.
You have to be like.	Olina okuba nga.
You can’t tell anyone.	Tosobola kubuulira muntu yenna.
I was alone at the house.	Nnali nzekka ku nnyumba.
He's coming.	Ajja.
But they were.	Naye baali.
I know that he is.	Nkimanyi nti ye.
Or to me.	Oba gyendi.
It’s easy, of course.	Kyangu, ddala.
He couldn’t work.	Yali tasobola kukola.
However, there it is.	Kyokka, awo we kiri.
He said it was true.	Yagambye nti kituufu.
This is what is going to happen now.	Kino kye kigenda okubaawo kati.
I thought this was true.	Kino nnalowooza nti kituufu.
No, he didn't want to go back to that, not really.	Nedda, yali tayagala kudda ku ekyo, si ddala.
It is definitely good.	Mazima ddala kirungi.
I can’t speak at the moment.	Sisobola kwogera mu kiseera kino.
She is his wife.	Ye mukyala we.
. . . .	.
And he loves it.	Era ayagala nnyo.
It’s not a person.	Si muntu.
He would love it.	Yandiyagadde nnyo.
And he's beautiful.	Era mulungi.
But! 	Naye!
He is a good man, really good.	Musajja mulungi, ddala mulungi.
But you are also human.	Naye naawe oli muntu.
I am a friend of mine.	Nze ndi mukwano gwange.
He was the father.	Ye yali taata.
Or it may be the case.	Oba kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
It was my thing.	Kyali kintu kyange.
I love stuff like that.	Njagala nnyo ebintu nga ebyo.
But you’re sick.	Naye ggwe mulwadde.
It’s the same as with you.	Kye kimu nga bwe kiri ku ggwe.
Money is not knowledge.	Ssente si kumanya.
He doesn’t want to go.	Tayagala kugenda.
I don’t think they are.	Sirowooza nti bwe bali.
We need it right now.	Twetaaga mu kiseera kino.
He had to get out of there.	Yalina okuva awo.
Very nice guy.	Omulungi ennyo.
Everyone is doing it now.	Buli omu akikola kati.
And he would be good to be.	Era yandibadde bulungi okuba.
But it’s not easy.	Naye si kyangu.
Little by little.	Katono katono.
You have no idea.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna.
Nothing serious.	Tewali kintu kya maanyi.
It is very important to do this as soon as possible.	Kikulu nnyo okukola kino mu bwangu.
He was very busy.	Yali bbize nnyo.
Apparently this is not the case.	Kirabika kino si bwe kiri.
I will do this below.	Kino nja kukikola wansi.
It’s good for us.	Kirungi gye tuli.
Obviously, there is money involved.	Kya lwatu nti mulimu ssente.
This movie was great.	Firimu eno yali nnungi nnyo.
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
That goes for everyone.	Ekyo kigenda ku buli muntu.
I thought he did a really good job there.	Nalowooza nti yakola omulimu mulungi ddala eyo.
He has one brother.	Alina muganda we omu.
And he couldn’t, but he wanted to.	Era yali tasobola, naye yali ayagala.
You just don’t have it.	Ggwe kyokka nga tolina.
No, he was a human being.	Nedda, yali muntu.
He obviously knew it.	Kya lwatu yali akimanyi.
That is exactly the truth.	Ekyo kye kituufu ddala.
You can’t win.	Tosobola kuwangula.
He is a teacher and loves his job.	Musomesa era ayagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
He is still happy.	Akyali musanyufu.
I have to be going.	Nnina okuba nga ngenda.
No one did it.	Tewali yakikola.
My father had to study with me.	Taata yali alina okusoma nange.
They were one and the same person.	Baali muntu omu era omu.
Or so he thought.	Oba bw’atyo bwe yalowooza.
No, nothing tonight.	Nedda, tewali kintu kyonna ekiro kino.
You will get a job again.	Ojja kuddamu okufuna omulimu.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
We’ll see about that.	Tujja kulaba ku nsonga eyo.
He didn't know how many.	Yali tamanyi bungi bungi.
He will come into play.	Ajja kujja mu nkola.
He didn’t want to be.	Yali tayagala kubeera.
As it always was.	Nga bwe kyali bulijjo.
I’m glad you’re here with me.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano nange.
I have very high hopes.	Nnina essuubi ddene nnyo.
Like a man.	Nga musajja.
That would be my dad.	Oyo yandibadde taata wange.
I know the knowledge.	Nze mmanyi okumanya.
But he knew it wasn’t.	Naye yali akimanyi nti si bwe kiri.
There is no good or bad.	Tewali kirungi oba kibi.
But we are not like that.	Naye ffe si bwe tuli.
And so he can.	Era bw’atyo asobola.
It can happen.	Kiyinza okubaawo.
I couldn’t do anything right, like my father.	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna kituufu, nga taata.
The plan worked well.	Enteekateeka eno yakola bulungi.
I don't know.	Simanyi.
Not now or never.	Si kati oba si bulijjo.
No, no, no, no.	Nedda, nedda, nedda.
Doing well in school seems easy.	Okukola obulungi ku ssomero kirabika nga kyangu.
You in the car.	Ggwe mu mmotoka.
He wanted to be together.	Yali ayagala kubeera bombi.
It’s really nice.	Ddala kirungi.
I need everyone there.	Nneetaaga buli muntu ali eyo.
It was dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe.
There is something troubling about all this.	Waliwo ekintu ekizibu ku bino byonna.
He felt very comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo.
Or the same thing.	Oba kye kimu.
You will do that.	Ekyo ojja kukikola.
However, there is none to be had here.	Kyokka wano tewali ya kubeerawo.
And it’s not good.	Era si kirungi.
That’s easy.	Ekyo kyangu.
I had gotten over.	Nali nfunye ku.
We have to do well.	Tulina okukola obulungi.
But nothing is easy here.	Naye wano tewali kyangu.
But he felt the same way.	Naye naye yawulira bw’atyo.
That’s the case here.	Ekyo bwe kiri wano.
It was probably true.	Oboolyawo kyali kituufu.
I’m sure I am.	Nkakasa nti ndi.
And in everyone.	Era mu buli muntu.
Everything but nothing.	Buli kimu okuggyako ekintu kyonna.
Maybe someone else can.	Mpozzi omuntu omulala asobola.
. . . .	.
He didn’t know it was him.	Yali tamanyi nti ye yali.
No one to answer to except myself.	Tewali muntu yenna gwe nnyinza kuddamu okuggyako nze kennyini.
How friendly they are.	Nga ba mukwano gye bali.
She really works hard.	Ddala akola nnyo.
Not that he would.	Si nti yandikoze.
I said no, I didn't.	Nagamba nti nedda.
It was a simple thing.	Kyali kintu kyangu.
You are so beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo.
He wasn’t going to do it.	Yali tagenda kukikola.
I am a man, and a human being.	Ndi musajja, era muntu.
That’s why we’re here.	Y’ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
He doesn’t have to make a policy.	Talina kukola nkola.
However, it is not him.	Kyokka si ye.
What kind of food, how much food.	Emmere ya ngeri ki, emmere mmeka.
But he can’t.	Naye tasobola.
This was very powerful.	Kino kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
Maybe more than that.	Mpozzi okusinga ekyo.
Everything was fine for about an hour.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi okumala essaawa nga emu.
She wanted to go to school.	Yali ayagala kugenda ku ssomero.
In the sky.	Mu bbanga.
It’s good in a way.	Kirungi mu ngeri emu.
Whether you like it or not.	Oba oyagala oba toyagala.
And he knows.	Era amanyi.
It is good that it is with.	Kirungi nti kiri ne.
He thought he could help.	Yalowooza nti asobola okuyamba.
Everyone has these.	Buli muntu alina bino.
It's not you.	Si ggwe.
For him, you have to help.	Ku ye, olina okuyamba.
In many ways.	Mu ngeri nnyingi.
But, you know,.	Naye, omanyi,.
No one wants to do this job.	Tewali ayagala kukola mulimu guno.
Every time.	Buli kiseera.
And that’s mostly the case.	Era ekyo okusinga bwe kiri.
Like today.	Nga leero.
How much money do you have on you?	Olina ssente mmeka ku ggwe?
But I was alone.	Naye nga nzekka.
Or he won’t work.	Oba tajja kukola.
I am not sure what to do.	Sikakasa kya kukola.
My father has been living alone at home.	Taata abadde abeera yekka awaka.
I don’t want to replace myself.	Saagala kudda mu kifo kyange.
At the time he was doing well.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali akola bulungi.
I’ve got a good job.	Nfunye omulimu omulungi.
But easier said than done.	Naye kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
This was largely true.	Kino okusinga kyali kituufu.
But no, there it is.	Naye nedda, awo we kiri.
He said he was a father himself.	Yagambye nti ye kennyini yali taata.
I really can’t get enough.	Mazima ddala sisobola kumala.
He thought maybe he could be that person.	Yalowooza nti osanga asobola okuba omuntu oyo.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
You will have to do it every day.	Ojja kuba olina okukikola buli lunaku.
You go tonight.	Ggwe ogenda ekiro kino.
What? 	Kiki?
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
Talking to you.	Okwogera naawe.
But this can happen.	Naye kino kiyinza okubaawo.
Indeed.	Ddala ddala.
Although probably not.	Wadde nga osanga si bwe kiri.
We should do the same.	Naffe tusaanidde okukola kye kimu.
There is no space.	Tewali kifo kyonna.
He wasn’t like that.	Yali si bw’atyo.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
I don’t want to be friends with you.	Saagala kubeera mukwano naawe.
He doesn’t need to answer.	Teyeetaaga kuddamu.
But, lucky or not, it doesn’t matter.	Naye, mukisa oba nedda, si kikulu.
I really had it.	Nze ddala nnali nfunye.
And that is now.	Era ekyo kiri kati.
Not without a man.	Si nga talina musajja.
He is not young.	Si muto.
That’s very obvious.	Ekyo kirabika nnyo.
We have to go home.	Tulina okudda eka.
He knew she was beautiful.	Yali akimanyi nti mulungi nnyo.
The reasons we have.	Ensonga ze tulina.
I'll come back to you.	Nja kudda gyoli.
This was the job he wanted.	Guno gwe mulimu gwe yali ayagala.
I wonder when this will happen.	Nze nneebuuza kino ddi lwe kigenda okubaawo.
And yet very powerful.	Era naye nga kya maanyi nnyo.
He looked the same as he did now.	Yali alabika nga bwe yali alabika kati.
Dad doesn’t quite know what to do to help.	Taata tamanyi bulungi kya kukola kuyamba.
Or even both of them.	Oba wadde bombi.
I, you know.	Nze, omanyi.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
He didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala.
Everyone every day.	Buli muntu buli lunaku.
You have to do it immediately.	Olina okukikola amangu ddala.
And how many.	Era nga mmeka.
No one has anything.	Tewali alina ky’alina.
We have so many things.	Tulina ebintu bingi nnyo.
It was time for action.	Kyali kiseera kya kukola.
He felt this would not be true.	Yawulira nti kino tekijja kuba kituufu.
But that was a problem.	Naye ekyo kyali kizibu.
He doesn’t need to do that.	Teyeetaaga kukola ekyo.
I knew that for a reason.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi lwa nsonga.
Getting this job would be a career milestone.	Okufuna omulimu guno kyandibadde kikulu nnyo mu mulimu.
I need to watch a movie.	Nze nneetaaga okulaba firimu.
I knew all along.	Nnali mmanyi buli kiseera.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I’m not sure it’s true.	Sikakasa nti kituufu.
That's why we're here.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
But it’s easy.	Naye kyangu.
I wish I could be helping.	Njagala nnyo okuba okuyamba.
You would love it.	Wandyagadde nnyo.
That’s not entirely true.	Ekyo si kituufu ddala.
He felt unable to say anything.	Yawulira nga tasobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
I can do the same thing.	Nze nsobola okukola ekintu kye kimu.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
I think that's me though.	Ndowooza oyo nze wadde.
So he did that.	Bwatyo ekyo yakikola.
And he wanted to do something.	Era yalina ky’ayagala okukola.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
There is no love without it.	Tewali kwagala nga tewali.
We were .	Twali .
I hear you are a man.	Mpulira gwe musajja.
He's fine tonight.	Ali bulungi ekiro kino.
I want to go.	Njagala okugenda.
Attitude does nothing for me.	Endowooza tewali kye nkola gyendi.
He did well.	Yakola bulungi.
It’s hard to see.	Kizibu okulaba.
To be like.	Okubeera nga.
From here to there.	Okuva wano okutuuka eyo.
No.	Nedda.
Every single one.	Buli omu omu.
This is a beautiful house.	Eno nnyumba nnungi nnyo.
Which he could see now himself.	Kye yali asobola okulaba kati ye kennyini.
It’s my problem.	Kizibu kyange.
Here is another one from the same place.	Wano waliwo omulala okuva mu kifo kye kimu.
He probably had his reasons.	Oboolyawo yalina ensonga ze.
It was exactly the same.	Kyali kye kimu ddala.
I think more than anyone in the house.	Ndowooza okusinga omuntu yenna mu nnyumba.
He was still asleep.	Yali akyali yeebase.
It was something about how they were together.	Kyali kintu ku ngeri gye baali bombi.
For the office.	Ku lwa ofiisi.
He did it better than anyone else.	Yakikola bulungi okusinga omuntu omulala yenna.
It was great back there.	Kyali kirungi nnyo emabega awo.
He lives very close to me.	Abeera kumpi nnyo nange.
The night goes swimming.	Ekiro kigenda okuwuga.
Now I have no problem.	Kati sirina buzibu.
We’ll have to wait a little longer.	Tujja kulinda akaseera katono.
We have to do things right.	Tulina okukola ebintu obulungi.
And of course he did.	Era ddala yakikola.
But it really was him.	Naye ddala yali ye.
I know we are friends.	Nkimanyi nti tuli ba mukwano.
Included or not.	Mulimu oba nedda.
No one knows exactly where my father is.	Tewali amanyi bulungi taata w’ali.
He wanted a house.	Yali ayagala ennyumba.
Not at the time, he thought.	Si mu kiseera ekyo, bwe yalowooza.
These include.	Mu bino mulimu.
And it’s actually quite difficult.	Era mu butuufu kizibu nnyo.
It’s actually quite good.	Mu butuufu kirungi nnyo.
I was expecting it.	Nnali nsuubira.
But really, it’s not bad.	Naye ddala, si kibi.
The concept worked better in theory than in practice.	Endowooza eyo yakola bulungi mu ndowooza okusinga mu nkola.
And so he was.	Era bw’atyo bwe yali.
It goes on and on.	Kigenda mu maaso ne kigenda mu maaso.
Only now.	Kati kyokka.
It’s a real problem.	Kizibu kya ddala.
I don’t need anything from you.	Sirina kye nneetaaga ku ggwe.
That's why he's still here.	Y'ensonga lwaki akyali wano.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
A picture, please.	Ekifaananyi, nsaba.
One saw the house.	Omu yalaba ennyumba.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
There is no way.	Tewali ngeri yonna.
No, of course, you have.	Nedda, ddala, olina.
He was so strong, so fast.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo, yali wa bwangu nnyo.
No, it’s nothing like that.	Nedda, si kintu nga ekyo.
There isn’t even one.	Tewali wadde emu.
Everyone is talking about it.	Buli omu ayogera ku nsonga eyo.
And he is always good.	Era bulijjo abeera mulungi.
He couldn’t go home.	Yali tasobola kudda waka.
And why not.	Era lwaki nedda.
In this place,.	Mu kifo kino,...
It’s as simple as that.	Kyangu nga ekyo.
He was on the floor.	Yali wansi.
What is this? 	Kino kye ki?
He said it was very important.	Yagambye nti kikulu nnyo.
He was going to make that call.	Yali agenda okukuba essimu eyo.
I feel a little sick.	Mpulira nga ndi mulwadde katono.
It’s not a place.	Si kifo.
How good of you to be here.	Nga kirungi nnyo gy’oli okubeera wano.
I need to talk to you.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe.
He needs to know.	Yeetaaga okumanya.
It’s not a very important thing.	Si kintu kikulu nnyo.
I’m sure you can do it.	Nkakasa nti osobola okukikola.
He couldn’t tell what it was.	Yali tasobola kumanya kye kyali.
He didn’t need it.	Yali teyeetaaga.
He had already found something he knew well.	Yali amaze okufuna ekintu kye yali amanyi obulungi.
But on this point.	Naye ku nsonga eno.
You were really good.	Ddala wali mulungi.
I go to work every day.	Ngenda ku mulimu buli lunaku.
He felt comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi.
And not everyone has those things.	Era si buli muntu nti alina ebintu ebyo.
And there he was.	Era awo we yali.
He loved driving at night.	Yali ayagala nnyo okuvuga ekiro.
It is just what it is.	Kye kiri kyokka kye kiri.
I have my own car.	Nnina mmotoka yange.
Or it could be someone else entirely.	Oba kiyinza okuba omuntu omulala ddala.
But it was difficult.	Naye kyali kizibu.
It’s not an idea.	Si kirowoozo.
Might have to get another one!.	Ayinza okuba nga alina okufuna omulala!.
My father has a lot of money.	Taata alina ssente nnyingi.
That is the way one should have done.	Eyo ye ngeri omuntu gye yandibadde alina okukola.
You are my friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange.
If you could help that would be great.	Singa osobola okuyamba ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
Not knowing anyone.	Si kumanya muntu yenna.
It is very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo.
Certainly not one on one.	Mazima ddala si omu ku omu.
Week after week.	Wiiki ku wiiki yonna.
But he knows it.	Naye akimanyi.
And that was that.	Era ekyo kye kyali ekyo.
I'll come tonight.	Nja kujja ekiro kino.
I could get here.	Nnali nsobola okutuuka wano.
It’s a good attitude.	Endowooza nnungi.
In every way.	Mu buli ngeri.
He knew it was there.	Yali amanyi nti kiri awo.
But you will do it.	Naye ggwe ojja kukikola.
This may be the problem.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kye kizibu.
He was very friendly.	Yali wa mukwano nnyo.
For both of us.	Eri ffembi.
Do you have to go?	Olina okugenda?
I can’t tell if it’s good or bad.	Sisobola kumanya oba kirungi oba kibi.
That’s okay, in my opinion.	Ekyo si kibi, mu ndowooza yange.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
Maybe he should have.	Mpozzi yandibadde.
That’s really great for them.	Ekyo ddala kirungi nnyo gye bali.
I didn’t know you were here.	Nze nali simanyi nti oli wano.
He had every one of these.	Yalina buli kimu ku bino.
Here he was safe.	Wano yali talina bulabe.
That thing is pretty cool.	Ekintu ekyo kirungi nnyo.
This was a good thing.	Kino kyali kirungi.
He couldn’t believe this was happening.	Yali tayinza kukkiriza nti kino kyali kigenda mu maaso.
You will have to make a plan.	Ojja kuba olina okukola enteekateeka.
He had always loved reading.	Bulijjo yali ayagala nnyo okusoma.
Not at any time.	Si mu kiseera kyonna.
Everyone wants to play.	Buli muntu ayagala kuzannya.
If he had.	Singa yalina.
And he would work.	Era yandikoze.
It’s not too hard to do.	Si kizibu nnyo okukola.
No one knows what you want but you.	Tewali amanyi kyoyagala okuggyako ggwe.
And it was true.	Era kyali kituufu.
I was completely alone.	Nnali nzekka ddala.
This was a fact.	Kino kyali kituufu.
And it wasn’t like that at all.	Era si bwe kyali n’akatono.
You won’t do it.	Tojja kukikola.
I am nothing.	Nze siri kintu kyonna.
My father was a teacher.	Taata yali musomesa.
You think you can do anything!.	Olowooza osobola okukola ekintu kyonna!.
I am very hungry.	Enjala enjala nnyo.
We are very strong.	Tuli ba maanyi nnyo.
He wanted that night.	Yali ayagala ekiro ekyo.
, No.	, Nedda.
Either way, you go.	Mu ngeri yonna, ogenda.
In the work the issue.	Mu mulimu ensonga.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kintu kye kimu.
No one will come.	Tewali ajja kujja.
You have it, too.	Naawe olina.
He was curious about everything.	Yali ayagala nnyo okumanya buli kimu.
For a while now.	Okumala akaseera kati.
He saw the whole thing.	Yalaba ekintu kyonna.
I want to believe that it is.	Njagala kukkiriza nti bwe kiri.
It was home.	Yali waka.
Happy, he said.	Musanyufu, bwe yagambye.
But he was here now.	Naye yali wano kati.
There is no problem there.	Tewali buzibu awo.
He’s going to be ready.	Agenda kubeera mwetegefu.
Down it comes.	Wansi kijja.
I really don’t know why.	Mazima ddala simanyi lwaki.
No one knew that.	Ekyo tewali yali akimanyi.
Someone like.	Omuntu nga.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
I love this picture.	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi kino.
It's his car.	Ye mmotoka ye.
Below is what we have.	Wansi bye tulina.
Right on time, of course.	Kituufu mu budde, ddala.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka kino si kituufu.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
He has someone else.	Alina omuntu omulala.
This is simply not true .	Kino si kituufu kyokka .
That’s not unusual though.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo wadde.
You are a young child.	Oli mwana muto.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Buli omu yali akimanyi nti ajja kubeerawo.
I have to find some time to talk to you.	Nnina okufuna akaseera okwogera naawe.
I just didn’t know what to do.	Nze nnali simanyi kya kukola.
I’m here tomorrow.	Nze ndi wano enkya.
The food was good there.	Emmere yali nnungi eyo.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
But if.	Naye singa...
You can move on now.	Osobola okugenda mu maaso kati.
We will work with you.	Tujja kukola naawe.
No, there isn’t.	Nedda, tewali.
I have a picture of him.	Nnina ekifaananyi kye.
Now you know where you are.	Kati omanyi gyoli.
It could be anyone.	Yandiba nga waliwo omuntu yenna.
Whatever you want.	Kyonna ky’oyagala.
Everything is going to be fine.	Buli kimu kigenda kuba bulungi.
There is reason for hope.	Waliwo ensonga lwaki tulina essuubi.
I think you will.	Ndowooza ojja kukikola.
Let him do his job.	Akole omulimu gwe.
No one had, as far as he knew.	Tewali yali alina, nga bwe yali amanyi.
I don’t want to live in this city.	Saagala kubeera mu kibuga kino.
I was feeling it.	Nnali mpulira.
That's why he wants to come here.	Y'ensonga lwaki ayagala kujja wano.
In fact, it’s really quite simple.	Mu butuufu, ddala kyangu nnyo.
He owned the house.	Yalina ennyumba eyo.
On the weekends.	Ku wiikendi.
It is true that money is not speech.	Kituufu ssente si kwogera.
I was very strong.	Nali wa maanyi nnyo.
I knew you were doing one.	Namanya nti okola kimu.
I strongly feel that he knows this.	Nze mpulira nnyo nti kino akimanyi.
He couldn’t come up with anything.	Yali tasobola kujja na kintu kyonna.
And he talked about.	Era yayogera ku.
But he was home.	Naye yali waka.
Every doctor had it.	Buli musawo yalina.
Everything is going on as usual.	Buli kimu kigenda mu maaso nga bulijjo.
When it goes, it goes.	Bwe kigenda, kigenda.
Bombi him.	Bombi ye.
It’s not easy to do.	Si kyangu kukikola.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali.
You have to get a job.	Olina okufuna omulimu.
It is this movie.	Ye firimu eno.
He was thinking of something like this too.	Yali alowooza ku kintu nga kino naye.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
He has no luck.	Talina mukisa.
Obviously not here.	Kya lwatu nti wano si bwe kiri.
I'm with me and I'm with me.	Nze nange nange nange.
I couldn’t find one.	Nnali sisobola kufuna emu.
Something will happen.	Ekintu kijja kubaawo.
I was strong.	Nnali wa maanyi.
He wasn’t good.	Yali si mulungi.
But now, nothing.	Naye kati, tewali kintu kyonna.
I will be back early in the morning.	Nja kudda ku makya ennyo.
But it’s pretty cool.	Naye nga kirungi nnyo.
He didn’t want to know.	Yali tayagala kumanya.
Or the food.	Oba emmere.
I’m sure that will be great.	Nkakasa nti ekyo kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
It’s real now.	Kya ddala kati.
But he was much more than that.	Naye yali asinga nnyo ekyo.
Photo last week.	Ekifaananyi wiiki ewedde.
At this hour he cannot eat.	Ku ssaawa eno tasobola kulya.
She was young and beautiful.	Yali muto era nga mulungi nnyo.
That, to me, is very important.	Ekyo, gyendi, kikulu nnyo.
I had no one to go with.	Nnali sirina gwe nnali ngenda naye.
No one spoke to him like that.	Tewali yayogera naye bw’atyo.
It was the only place he knew.	Kyali kifo kyokka kye yali amanyi.
I am good at this.	Ndi mulungi mu kino.
But he did, anyway.	Naye yakikola, mu ngeri yonna.
That, is what we are.	Ekyo, kye tuli.
I can’t really be with him and do much.	Mu butuufu sisobola kubeera naye ne nkola bingi.
He couldn’t just watch.	Yali tasobola kumala kulaba.
I think maybe that's the problem for me.	Ndowooza osanga ekyo kye kizibu gyendi.
It’s not good at all.	Si kirungi n’akatono.
But there is reason for hope.	Naye waliwo ensonga lwaki waliwo essuubi.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
That’s not as bad.	Ekyo si kibi nga bwe kiri.
He was unusual, and that was bad.	Yali si wa bulijjo era ekyo kyali kibi.
But in this case it’s really hard.	Naye mu mbeera eno ddala kizibu.
I don’t want to see that thing again.	Saagala kuddamu kulaba kintu ekyo.
He is on you.	Ali ku ggwe.
This is what.	Kino kye ki...
It’s really easy.	Kyangu ddala.
Everything is very important.	Buli kintu kikulu nnyo.
I can’t find one.	Sisobola kufuna emu.
But he won’t do it.	Naye tajja kukikola.
He can’t see anything but money.	Tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna okuggyako ssente.
We can talk.	Tusobola okwogera.
I have the time.	Nnina obudde.
It’s not dangerous.	Si kya bulabe.
But to me, this movie is great.	Naye gyendi, firimu eno nnungi nnyo.
Driving at night is dangerous.	Okuvuga ekiro kya bulabe.
He would have been.	Yandibadde.
And it’s true.	Era kituufu.
He was the best in every way.	Ye yali asinga mu buli ngeri.
I don’t know of anything like that.	Simanyi kintu kyonna ng’ekyo.
Exactly what they were.	Ddala bwe baali.
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza.
No waste of time and excellent work.	Tewali kumala budde era mulimu omulungi ennyo.
I will never do that again.	Ekyo sijja kuddamu kukikola.
Not as it is.	Si nga bwe kiri.
Right downstairs.	Wansi ddala.
I think you’re sick.	Ndowooza nti oli mulwadde.
He came to live in the city.	Yajja okubeera mu kibuga.
That is the real problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu ennyo.
In fact, everything is.	Mu butuufu, buli kimu bwe kiri.
It won’t be good.	Tekijja kuba bulungi.
Or to both of them.	Oba eri bombi.
All night long, of course.	Ekiro kyonna, ddala.
But it’s going on.	Naye kigenda mu maaso.
Surely, he would have preferred this.	Mazima ddala, kino yandibadde ayagala nnyo.
I feel like I’m in a hurry.	Mpulira nga ndi bwangu.
You go with him.	Ggwe ogenda naye.
Not on this one.	Si ku kino.
He quickly went to work.	Yagenda mangu ku mulimu.
His dad had an idea of ​​what he should do.	Taata we yalina endowooza ku ky’alina okukola.
That’s what we need.	Ekyo kye twetaaga.
That’s not my point.	Eyo si y’ensonga yange.
He couldn’t believe his luck.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza mukisa gwe.
I guess it’s okay.	Ntebereza nti tewali buzibu.
My father does the same.	Taata akola kye kimu.
I don’t have a brother.	Sirina muganda wange.
He has the power.	Alina amaanyi.
I think this is definitely the case.	Ndowooza kino ddala bwe kiri.
Obviously this is a long-term thing.	Kya lwatu kino kintu kya bbanga ddene.
No one will speak.	Tewali ajja kwogera.
He is a very good friend of mine.	Ye mukwano gwange omulungi ennyo.
From the point of view.	Okuva ku nsonga.
It was a sin.	Kyali kibi.
It’s good to go.	Kirungi okugenda.
I don’t know the truth.	Simanyi kituufu.
I guess it was just the timing.	Ntebereza nti kyali kiseera kyokka.
He will surely come.	Mazima ddala ajja kujja.
It’s not my practice.	Si kye nkola yange.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
Not much.	Si bingi.
And he was with her.	Era yali naye.
It’s a real room.	Kisenge kya ddala.
And therein lies the problem for us.	Era awo we wali ekizibu gye tuli.
He was unhappy but there was nothing he could do.	Yali si musanyufu naye nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola.
He's coming here.	Ajja wano.
However, he knew that wouldn't work.	Kyokka yali akimanyi nti ekyo tekijja kukola.
Probably not much, probably a long time.	Oboolyawo si bingi, oboolyawo ebbanga ddene.
And the same problem appeared.	Era ekizibu kye kimu ne kirabika.
He could win another one.	Yali asobola okuwangula omulala.
That was probably my problem.	Oboolyawo kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
It was a thing of beauty.	Kyali kintu kya bulungi.
My opinion, none.	Endowooza yange, tewali.
You know, we can do it.	Omanyi, tusobola okukikola.
We’ll do it again this week.	Tugenda kuddamu okukikola wiiki eno.
He knew it was there though.	Yali akimanyi nti kyali awo wadde.
I want to win today.	Njagala kuwangula leero.
One is not very good.	Omu si mulungi nnyo.
He did it himself.	Yakikola ye kennyini.
It was really quick and easy.	Ddala kyali kyangu era kyangu.
We have to get back to work soon.	Tulina okudda ku mulimu mu bbanga ttono.
He was a human being.	Yali muntu.
I’m sure you’ll be just fine.	Nkakasa nti ojja kuba bulungi nnyo.
Tonight the bus is here.	Ekiro kya leero bbaasi eri wano.
It is true of us.	Kituufu naffe.
That was easier said than done.	Ekyo kyali kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
I think it would be you.	Ndowooza yandibadde ggwe.
I said she was fine, and she was.	Nagamba nti yali bulungi, era yali.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
Probably not always.	Oboolyawo si bulijjo.
That’s easy to say.	Ekyo kyangu okwogera.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
But he had to do it.	Naye yalina okukikola.
Of course, I was too young to be there.	Kya lwatu nti nnali muto nnyo nga sisobola kubeerawo.
I can’t believe it.	Siyinza kukkiriza.
He wanted to go home.	Yali ayagala kudda waka.
And he was powerless, powerless.	Era yali talina maanyi, nga talina maanyi.
It will be good for everyone.	Kijja kuba kirungi eri buli muntu.
Working with us is easy.	Okukola naffe kyangu.
It’s not really my thing.	Mu butuufu si kintu kyange.
He knew that, now, here in his room.	Ekyo yali akimanyi, kati, wano mu kisenge kye.
This is the problem for us in this situation.	Kino kye kizibu gye tuli mu mbeera eno.
And you are .	Era ggwe oli .
My father has been ill.	Taata abadde mulwadde.
He loved this thing.	Yali ayagala nnyo ekintu kino.
That’s what we have to do.	Ekyo kye tulina okukola.
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
That house is dangerous.	Ennyumba eyo ya bulabe.
Someone like us, maybe.	Omuntu nga ffe, mpozzi.
He is in a dangerous position.	Ali mu mbeera ya bulabe.
I want my room.	Njagala kisenge kyange.
You have three.	Olina ssatu.
It is very dangerous.	Kya bulabe nnyo.
I will never allow that to happen again.	Ekyo sijja kuddamu kukkiriza kubaawo.
This was mine now.	Kino kye kyali kyange kati.
And there it was.	Era awo we kyali.
But that’s what it is.	Naye ekyo kye kiri.
You won’t win.	Tojja kuwangula.
He didn't want her to do this.	Kino yali tayagala akole.
He was sick.	Yali mulwadde.
He doesn’t need a car or apparently a house.	Teyeetaaga mmotoka oba kirabika ennyumba.
Maybe that was all it was.	Mpozzi ekyo kyokka kye kyali.
I don’t know when.	Simanyi ddi.
But with or without me, it was going to happen.	Naye nga nnina oba nga sirina, kyali kigenda kubaawo.
But it’s not easy.	Naye si kyangu.
Or not.	Oba nedda.
They are not now.	Si bwe bali kati.
But in reality this is not the case.	Naye mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
And no one really wants that.	Era ekyo tewali ayagala ddala.
A little bit of it.	Katono ddala.
We’re in trouble here.	Tuli mu buzibu wano.
I wanted to do it again.	Nnali njagala okuddamu okukikola.
This is what you really want.	Kino ky’oyagala ennyo.
She wanted a child.	Yali ayagala mwana.
You can’t win.	Tosobola kuwangula.
But he agreed.	Naye yakkiriza.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
They certainly are not.	Mazima ddala si bwe bali.
I guess we have to imagine.	Ntebereza nti tulina okulowooza.
Now you know why.	Kati omanyi lwaki.
We could do a lot of things, if we had more money.	Twali tusobola okukola ebintu bingi, singa tulina ssente nnyingi.
He is a good child.	Ye mwana mulungi.
He didn’t want to go back to office.	Yali tayagala kudda mu ofiisi.
He wasn’t going to let it happen.	Yali tagenda kukkiriza kubaawo.
Not to me.	Si gyendi.
He'll wait.	Ajja kulinda.
This is the case now.	Kino bwe kiri kati.
It is dangerous to go alone.	Kya bulabe okugenda wekka.
He's not well at all.	Tali bulungi n'akatono.
What a wonderful time.	Nga kiseera kirungi nnyo.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
All he knew was that he had to talk to her.	Kye yali amanyi nti yalina okwogera naye.
He'll be here for the weekend.	Agenda kubeera wano ku wiikendi.
That is why we can do that.	Ye nsonga lwaki tusobola okukola ekyo.
No one had it.	Tewali yalina.
I think you're going.	Ndowooza ogenda.
I’m very busy today.	Nze leero bbize nnyo.
It had to be good.	Yalina okuba obulungi.
This is as good a place as anything.	Kino kifo kirungi nga buli kimu.
And in that way.	Era mu ngeri eyo.
She is young, well-informed, and well-spoken.	Muto, amanyi bulungi, era amanyi bulungi okwogera.
It was probably for everyone.	Oboolyawo yali eri buli muntu.
Even on the day.	Ne ku lunaku.
He has a dog.	Alina embwa.
You will get a lot of this.	Kino ojja kufuna bingi.
He won’t be now.	Tajja kuba kati.
Now he knew better.	Kati yali asinga okumanya.
Today that is not true.	Leero ekyo si kituufu.
I knew it really wasn’t my business.	Namanya nti ddala si nsonga yange.
Just that picture, the picture.	Ekifaananyi ekyo kyokka, ekifaananyi.
We have to do this every morning!.	Kino tulina okukikola buli ku makya!.
I need to talk to him.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye.
We will move forward.	Tujja kugenda mu maaso.
You have to know everything.	Olina okumanya buli kimu.
I’m sorry about this.	Nsonyiwa ku nsonga eno.
I don’t want your forgiveness.	Saagala nsonyiwa yo.
In a sense it is.	Mu ngeri emu bwe kiri.
I'll go back.	Nja kudda emabega.
He made a plan.	Yakola enteekateeka.
I can never let that happen again.	Ekyo siyinza kuddamu kukkiriza kubaawo.
You have to move on.	Olina okugenda mu maaso.
I have to say.	Nnina okugamba.
But he wants food.	Naye ayagala emmere.
He works on.	Akola ku.
Just the same thing in every city.	Ekintu kye kimu kyokka mu buli kibuga.
That’s very important for my book.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo eri ekitabo kyange.
Otherwise he was afraid of getting in trouble.	Oba si ekyo yali atya okufuna obuzibu.
There are so many, so many.	Bingi nnyo, bingi nnyo.
Getting an opinion.	Okufuna endowooza.
Everyone knows that, but it can work well.	Ekyo buli omu akimanyi, naye kiyinza okukola obulungi.
For the weekend.	Ku lwa wiikendi.
It is absolutely true.	Kituufu ddala.
He speaks the truth.	Ayogera mazima.
It would be simple but very visible from the air.	Kyandibadde kyangu naye nga kirabika nnyo okuva mu bbanga.
I just loved working with him.	Nze nnali njagala nnyo okukola naye.
The job, it’s the job.	Omulimu, gwe mulimu.
We’ll just have to see what happens.	Tujja kumala kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
Today everyone does everything.	Leero buli muntu akola buli kimu.
I'm going now.	Nze ngenda kati.
I think this is very important.	Ndowooza kino kikulu nnyo.
In that, but not in everything.	Mu ekyo, naye si mu buli kimu.
He was close.	Yali kumpi.
Now you have to eat.	Kati olina okulya.
I don't know why he did that either.	Nange simanyi lwaki yakola ekyo.
He's ready to go.	Mwetegefu okugenda.
Still popular today.	Akyali muganzi n’okutuusa leero.
He was an only child.	Yali mwana yekka.
Nothing too complicated.	Tewali kintu kizibu nnyo.
You have the power.	Ggwe olina amaanyi.
But you will be able to help that person a lot.	Naye ojja kusobola okuyamba ennyo omuntu oyo.
She loved it and couldn't wait to go again.	Yali ayagala nnyo era nga tasobola kulinda kuddamu kugenda.
Everyone wants to do well.	Buli muntu ayagala okukola obulungi.
Everyone knows everything.	Buli muntu amanyi buli kimu.
And of course, that’s true.	Era ddala, ekyo kituufu.
Of course, he would.	Kya lwatu nti yandikoze.
That's just me.	Oyo nze nzekka.
And it looks very festive at parties.	Era kirabika nga kya mbaga nnyo ku mbaga.
We were so close.	Twali tuli kumpi nnyo.
This was a serious problem.	Kino kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
He knew what he had in his wife.	Yali amanyi kye yalina mu mukyala we.
I knew you would come back.	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kudda.
It was just a matter of time.	Kyali kiseera kyokka.
I am ready to read this book.	Ndi mwetegefu okusoma ekitabo kino.
He knew everything she needed to know.	Yali amanyi buli kimu kye yali yeetaaga okumanya.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
He knows he can.	Akimanyi nti asobola.
It seems pretty complicated, doesn’t it?	Kirabika kizibu nnyo, si bwe kiri?
That is my problem really.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyange ddala.
I don’t want to go back to my room.	Saagala kudda mu kisenge kyange.
He got lucky.	Yafuna omukisa.
But acting quickly is not easy.	Naye okukola amangu si kyangu.
I think that’s what we’re moving towards.	Ndowooza ekyo kye tugenda mu maaso.
I think you can’t do that.	Ndowooza ekyo tosobola kukikola.
Who would it be us.	Ani yandibadde ffe.
You know better than that.	Omanyi okusinga ekyo.
He couldn't really know, not now.	Yali tasobola kumanya ddala, si kati.
That doesn’t matter now.	Ekyo si kikulu kati.
I will do it again.	Nja kuddamu okukikola.
This is simply not true.	Kino si kituufu kyokka.
I don’t know anything.	Sirina kye mmanyi.
I knew from there that we would have a problem.	Namanya okuva awo nti tujja kufuna ekizibu.
This picture is of my house.	Ekifaananyi kino kya nnyumba yange.
That is certainly true.	Ekyo mazima ddala kituufu.
I need to get out of here.	Nze nneetaaga okuva wano.
It would be nice.	Kyandibadde kirungi.
I doubt that will happen.	Nbuusabuusa nti ekyo kijja kubaawo.
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
Like you were getting away from me all the time.	Nga bwe wali ogenda okuva ku nze buli kiseera.
I will be more than ready.	Nja kuba mwetegefu okusinga.
And it really is.	Era ddala bwe kiri.
But that is by no means the case.	Naye ekyo mu ngeri yonna si bwe kiri.
The guy does the job.	Ggaayi akola omulimu.
That’s all this really is.	Ekyo kyokka kino kye kiri ddala.
Maybe he did.	Mpozzi bwe yakola.
I’m going to school.	Ngenda ku ssomero.
Everything happens so fast.	Buli kimu kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
Someone I love very much.	Omuntu gwe njagala ennyo.
Perhaps he lived alone.	Oboolyawo yali abeera yekka.
He told me that himself.	Ekyo yangamba ye kennyini.
I’m with you on that.	Nze ndi naawe ku ekyo.
You have a plan.	Olina enteekateeka.
But almost anything goes now.	Naye kumpi buli kimu kigenda kati.
I’ve just been here.	Nze mbadde wano kyokka.
He tried to think of what to say.	Yagezaako okulowooza ku ky’alina okwogera.
But it was in trouble.	Naye kyali mu buzibu.
Certainly not good.	Mazima ddala si kirungi.
I didn’t know what to do!	Nnali simanyi kya kukola!
It's not a party.	Si mbaga.
You have to come back and you have to come back soon.	Olina okudda era olina okudda amangu.
You’re the only one.	Ggwe wekka.
Now that’s powerful.	Kati ekyo kya maanyi.
He felt very awkward about it.	Yawulira nga alina ekizibu ennyo ku nsonga eyo.
I feel a lot about that.	Mpulira nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
You’re sure you don’t want .	Okakasa nti toyagala .
But we have to do the work.	Naye tulina okukola omulimu.
He didn’t know he would.	Yali tamanyi nti ekyo ajja kukikola.
Where we are.	Ffe we ​​tuli.
More than that.	Okusinga awo.
It’s not easy to find something you want.	Si kyangu kufuna kintu ky’oyagala.
I was mostly happy.	Nze okusinga nnali musanyufu.
He is the only one.	Ye yekka yekka.
I have things to do.	Nnina ebintu bye nnina okukola.
There all morning.	Eyo enkya yonna.
I'm afraid.	Nze ntya.
In fact, it is right to do so.	Mu butuufu, kituufu okukikola.
This can happen for many reasons.	Kino kiyinza okubaawo ensonga nnyingi.
It could have been anything or anyone.	Kyandibadde kintu kyonna oba omuntu yenna.
And very easy to do.	Era nga kyangu nnyo okukola.
I am nobody, except me.	Siri muntu yenna, okuggyako nze.
This was very close.	Kino kyali kya kumpi nnyo.
It won’t be exactly the same.	Tekijja kuba kye kimu ddala.
I didn’t know it.	Nze nali simanyi.
Not so today.	Si bwe kiri leero.
Not that, either.	Si ekyo, era.
Or it doesn’t matter.	Oba si kikulu.
I’m willing to do it.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukikola.
He can do it.	Asobola okukikola.
Everything here was and is.	Buli kimu wano kyali era kiri.
Ddala is the one.	Ddala ye ye.
We will help in any way we can.	Tujja kuyamba mu ngeri yonna gye tusobola.
I've been thinking about it.	Mbadde ndowooza ku nsonga eyo.
Only in the room.	Mu kisenge kyokka.
He certainly wasn't going to do it.	Mazima ddala yali tagenda kukikola.
I hope it continues every day.	Nsuubira nti kigenda mu maaso buli lunaku.
It will be wonderful.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
Nobody wants to stay here.	Tewali ayagala kusigala wano.
We have to go!	Tulina okugenda!
Nothing wrong with me.	Tewali kibi kyonna gyendi.
My father was there.	Taata yali awo.
It would be very difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
Now it’s much easier to do.	Kati kyangu nnyo okukola.
Now it was the dilemma.	Kati kye kyali ekizibu ekizibu.
There is nothing positive about it.	Tewali kintu kyonna kirungi ku nsonga eyo.
I was like you.	Nze nali nga ggwe.
Whatever they are.	Kyonna kye bali.
He is more accepting today.	Asinga kukkiriza leero.
I don’t know the answer.	Simanyi kya kuddamu.
I don’t know much about it.	Simanyi bingi ku nsonga eyo.
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kirungi.
We will definitely come.	Mazima ddala tujja kujja.
And he shouldn’t.	Era tasaanidde kukikola.
We deserve what we deserve.	Naffe bwe tusaanidde bwe tusaanidde.
Not long now.	Si bbanga ddene kati.
He wants you home.	Ayagala ggwe awaka.
He lives in the city.	Abeera mu kibuga.
And it’s going to have to wait until tomorrow.	Era kigenda kulinda okutuusa enkya.
I can do that, he said.	Ekyo nsobola okukikola, bwe yagambye.
I really don’t know what to do.	Mazima ddala simanyi kya kukola.
He was a young child.	Yali mwana muto.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
I'm going home.	Ngenda waka.
I just want to make sure he’s okay.	Njagala kulaba kyokka nti ali bulungi.
This is a wonderful opportunity.	Guno mukisa mulungi nnyo.
In fact, he does.	Mu butuufu akola bw’atyo.
This is a common practice.	Eno nkola ya bulijjo.
We should speak up.	Tusaanidde okwogera.
I am one of them.	Nze ndi omu.
It’s not my issue.	Si nsonga yange.
It’s coming to you.	Kijja gy’oli.
Now it is not.	Kati si bwe kiri.
He wanted to do it.	Yali ayagala kukikola.
No, he doesn’t need to.	Nedda, teyeetaaga.
Or almost everyone.	Oba kumpi buli muntu.
It is a form of faith.	Kye ngeri ya kukkiriza.
He didn’t need one.	Yali teyeetaaga emu.
Why would it be.	Lwaki kyandibadde.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
It’s not his way.	Si ngeri ye.
If this continues and I think it will.	Singa kino kigenda mu maaso era ndowooza kijja.
I don’t know if it would be good for anyone.	Simanyi kyandibadde kirungi eri omuntu yenna.
So did my father.	Bwatyo ne taata bwe yakola.
But you have it.	Naye ggwe olina.
You’re coming with me.	Ggwe ojja nange.
However, perhaps not.	Kyokka, mpozzi si bwe kiri.
To everyone.	Eri buli omu.
What a child, what a good child.	Nga mwana, nga mwana mulungi.
But no one knows any of this.	Naye tewali amanyi kintu kyonna ku bino.
I'm sure of that.	Nze nkakasa nti.
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
He should have come soon.	Yandibadde ajja mangu.
That’s not entirely true.	Ekyo si kituufu ddala.
He worked hard.	Yakola nnyo.
If only he knew what it was.	Singa yali amanyi kye kyali.
Actually, probably absolutely.	Mu butuufu, oboolyawo ddala.
What a beautiful boyfriend.	Nga muganzi mulungi.
For us, this is very important.	Ffe kino kikulu nnyo.
He was in better shape than this.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi okusinga eno.
I am happy to be here.	Ndi musanyufu okubeera wano.
He's not there.	Tali awo.
But that is not the case here.	Naye wano si bwe kiri.
We cannot know.	Tetusobola kumanya.
And maybe we are too.	Era mpozzi naffe bwe tuli.
Not at the moment.	Si mu kiseera kino.
Not that he thought it would.	Si nti yali alowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
I’ve been everywhere.	Mbadde buli wamu.
I don’t think it’s easy.	Sirowooza nti kyangu.
And every reason to do so.	Era buli nsonga lwaki tulina okukola ekyo.
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
This is the crux of the problem.	Kino kye kikulu ennyo mu kizibu kino.
Whose idea was this?	Kino kyali kirowoozo kya ani?
Someone had to do it.	Waliwo omuntu yali alina okukikola.
The ordinary person.	Omuntu wa bulijjo.
That’s his problem, that’s not my problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kye, ekyo si kye kizibu kyange.
That's the one there.	Oyo ye eyo eyo.
You were always right behind me.	Bulijjo wali emabega wange ddala.
He is not here.	Tali wano.
I knew it was true.	Nnali nkimanyi nti kituufu.
I’m almost there actually.	Nze ndi kumpi awo mu butuufu.
Excellent work.	Omulimu omulungi ennyo.
This, of course, was true.	Kino, ddala, kyali kituufu.
He can’t see.	Tasobola kulaba.
Apparently it isn’t.	Kirabika si bwe kiri.
Now, the point was this.	Kati, ensonga yali eno.
It was devastating, for both of us.	Kyali kizibu nnyo, ku ffe ffembi.
He knew how to win every issue.	Yali amanyi okuwangula buli nsonga.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
He was ready to go at this point.	Yali mwetegefu okugenda mu kiseera kino.
He has to know they are there.	Alina okumanya nti bali awo.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
Everything was suddenly right.	Buli kimu kyali kituufu mu bwangu.
I know so much more.	Nze mmanyi bingi nnyo.
He has no problems.	Talina buzibu bwonna.
Or from himself.	Oba okuva eri ye kennyini.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
I really wanted to do it.	Nnali njagala kukikola ddala.
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
And you can.	Era osobola.
It was just mine.	Kyali kyange kyokka.
I can’t do everything today or even this week.	Sisobola kukola buli kimu leero oba wadde wiiki eno.
No, you should go.	Nedda, wandibadde ogenda.
We’re at the party!	Tuli ku kabaga!
He was always happy to help.	Bulijjo yali musanyufu okuyamba.
Who knows best in the room?	Ani asinga okumanya mu kisenge?
I want to drive my car.	Njagala kuvuga mmotoka yange.
She says no one is home.	Agamba nti awaka tewali muntu yenna.
And you’ve been with him.	Era obadde naye.
It’s not just an idea.	Si kirowoozo kyokka.
Now, you’re ready.	Kati, oli mwetegefu.
And he is the best.	Era ye asinga obulungi.
You’ll know soon enough.	Ojja kumanya mu bbanga ttono.
Here he had everything he needed.	Wano yalina buli kye yali yeetaaga.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
Or whatever they are.	Oba kyonna kye bali.
He is not very good.	Si mulungi nnyo.
Not to get to work.	Si okutuuka ku mulimu.
He felt ready for anything.	Yawulira nga mwetegefu okukola ekintu kyonna.
This can go many ways.	Kino kiyinza okugenda mu ngeri nnyingi.
But he’s not really that busy.	Naye mu butuufu si bbize bw’atyo.
I’m sure he’ll do well.	Nkakasa nti ajja kukola bulungi.
And there was so much more.	Era nga waliwo bingi nnyo.
It certainly was the case with me.	Mazima ddala bwe kyali ku nze.
He was glad he could help.	Yali musanyufu nti yali asobola okuyamba.
It’s bad, it’s terrible.	Kibi, kibi nnyo.
He did, you know.	Yakikola, omanyi.
It will be here.	Kijja kuba wano.
And that’s not easy.	Era ekyo si kyangu.
It was his watch.	Yali ssaawa ye.
It probably won’t happen again.	Oboolyawo tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
But that was not the case here.	Naye wano si bwe kyali.
I love this movie.	Njagala nnyo firimu eno.
I thought he was talking about me, but he wasn’t.	Nalowooza nti yali ayogera ku nze, naye si bwe yali.
What is that	Ekyo kye ki .
You know now.	Omanyi kati.
In with you.	Mu naawe.
He had been in his room.	Yali abadde mu kisenge kye.
Everything was going to be fine.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda kuba bulungi.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
But I feel so much better.	Naye mpulira bulungi nnyo.
I don’t know what that is.	Ekyo simanyi ki.
He often does it.	Atera okukikola.
And this would be true.	Era kino kyandibadde kituufu.
He was always good to me.	Bulijjo yali mulungi gyendi.
He doesn’t have you.	Talina ggwe.
He probably wasn’t coming.	Oboolyawo yali tajja.
No one spoke.	Tewali yayogera.
Not myself right now.	Si nze kennyini mu kiseera kino.
I want that right now.	Ekyo njagala mu kiseera kino.
You might as well say you won’t work with me.	Oyinza okusinga okugamba nti tojja kukola nange.
He was thinking, urgently.	Yali alowooza, mu bwangu.
As he had been doing.	Nga bwe yali abadde akola.
But it looks good to me.	Naye kirabika bulungi gyendi.
That's not why we're here.	Si y'ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
I couldn’t do anything.	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
And that's what that is.	Era ekyo kye ekyo.
It was the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu.
I am in this situation.	Nze mu mbeera eno.
Or tomorrow.	Oba enkya.
I'm not sure which.	Sikakasa ki.
However, this is just normal.	Kyokka kino kya bulijjo kyokka.
In many ways.	Mu ngeri nnyingi.
At the moment no one can.	Mu kiseera kino tewali asobola.
But he knew that.	Naye ekyo yali akimanyi.
I want some time alone with you.	Njagala akaseera nga ndi nzekka naawe.
I know, me too.	Nze mmanyi, nze nange.
I don’t like this.	Kino sikyagala.
It was just normal.	Kyali kya bulijjo kyokka.
In this case, not so much.	Mu mbeera eno, si bingi nnyo.
I don’t really know too much about him.	Mu butuufu simanyi bingi nnyo ku ye.
He could not do this for very long.	Kino yali tasobola kukikola okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
I was his only wife before.	Nze nali mukyala we yekka emabegako.
All of us	Ffenna .
But now we don’t have time.	Naye kati tetulina budde.
These are the following.	Bino bye bino.
But you are so beautiful.	Naye oli mulungi nnyo.
That's about that.	Ekyo kiri ku ekyo.
He knows we are here.	Akimanyi nti tuli wano.
He needed to be where you had been.	Yali yeetaaga kubeera mu kifo we wali obadde.
He just like everyone else.	Ye nga buli muntu omulala yenna.
No, it was terrible.	Nedda, kyali kibi nnyo.
Everyone was still at home.	Buli omu yali akyali waka.
Not every idea is good.	Si buli ndowooza nti nnungi.
Not for the money.	Si lwa ssente.
He will do that.	Ekyo ajja kukikola.
It was that they were very strong.	Kyali nti baali ba maanyi nnyo.
He was strong.	Yali wa maanyi.
He must have known.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali akimanyi.
But it doesn’t really matter.	Naye si kikulu nnyo.
Not on him.	Si ku ye.
That’s hard to say.	Ekyo kizibu okwogera.
But that, of course, is not true.	Naye ekyo, kya lwatu, si kituufu.
He was so beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo yali.
He said it was good.	Yagambye nti kyali kirungi.
Everything was fine.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi.
He said he didn’t even know why.	Yagambye nti tamanyi na lwaki.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
I used to live here before.	Nze nali mbeera wano emabegako.
It won’t really matter.	Tekijja kuba kikulu nnyo.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
Maybe there was something he could find.	Mpozzi nga waliwo kye yali asobola okufuna.
I didn’t know who or where I was going.	Nnali simanyi ani oba wa gye nnali ngenda.
This is easy.	Kino kyangu.
Money isn’t everything, you know.	Ssente si buli kimu, omanyi.
Then someone said.	Awo omuntu n’agamba nti.
The house is beautiful.	Ennyumba nnungi.
He will probably win, he thought.	Oboolyawo ajja kuwangula, bwe yalowooza.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
Maybe not all of it.	Mpozzi si byonna.
He is here for a reason.	Ali wano lwa nsonga.
He really doesn’t need to answer.	Mazima ddala teyeetaaga kuddamu.
This seems to be the case.	Kino kirabika nga bwe kiri.
It’s a very good point.	Ensonga nnungi nnyo.
One cannot be anything one wants.	Omuntu tayinza kuba kintu kyonna ky’ayagala.
I didn’t know how to do this.	Kino nnali simanyi ngeri ya kukola.
It's not you.	Si ggwe.
He is the only child.	Ye mwana yekka.
He says a lot as well.	Agamba nnyo nga bwe kiri.
That's why you can't get more.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tosobola kufuna bingi.
I knew it wouldn’t work.	Namanya nti tekijja kukola.
Not too much of it.	Si bingi nnyo.
I have those.	Nnina ebyo.
Now it was my turn.	Kati kyali kiseera kyange.
He was on to me very quickly.	Yali ku nze mu bwangu nnyo.
We have to think ahead.	Tulina okulowooza mu maaso.
This is easier said than done.	Kino kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
But there is a problem with that.	Naye ekyo waliwo obuzibu.
That was the reason why.	Eyo ye yali ensonga lwaki.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
Nothing was easy.	Tewali kyali kyangu.
Pictured this week.	Ekifaananyi wiiki eno.
They were fine.	Baali bulungi.
It’s great to see that.	Kirungi nnyo okulaba ekyo.
I was convinced.	Nali nkakasa.
And now, so was he.	Era kati, naye bwe yali.
You're not well.	Toli bulungi.
That’s certainly what’s going on here.	Ekyo mazima ddala kye kigenda mu maaso wano.
You didn’t know.	Ggwe wali tomanyi.
He loves to go home.	Ayagala nnyo okudda eka.
It wasn’t his place.	Si kye kyali kifo kye.
He came to me.	Yajja gye ndi.
Neither here nor there.	Wadde wano wadde eyo.
He didn’t want to tell anyone.	Yali tayagala kubuulira muntu yenna.
But this is not true.	Naye kino si kituufu.
Not like me.	Si nga nze.
You can’t, of course, do this.	Tosobola, ddala, okukola kino.
Maybe we are.	Mpozzi ffe.
Almost all of us.	Kumpi ffenna.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
No one seems happy.	Tewali alabika nga musanyufu.
Works very well in many applications.	Akola bulungi nnyo mu nkola nnyingi.
I can help.	Nsobola okuyamba.
You can talk to the police.	Osobola okwogera ne poliisi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Certainly not money.	Mazima ddala si ssente.
The food is excellent.	Emmere nnungi nnyo.
Now it’s commonplace.	Kati kya bulijjo.
There is a job.	Waliwo omulimu.
Nothing was happening.	Tewali kyali kigenda mu maaso.
But he's coming.	Naye ajja.
You should definitely go.	Mazima ddala olina okugenda.
Even if he was a brother.	Ne bwe yali wa muganda.
Everything is nothing.	Buli kimu si kintu.
Everything seems normal.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
You want to do this today.	Kino oyagala kukikola leero.
Of course, of course.	Kya lwatu, kya lwatu.
There is no cost for this.	Kino tewali ssente yonna.
It is not for the present.	Si kya kiseera kino.
I am not a morning person.	Siri muntu wa makya.
But that’s not what matters.	Naye ekyo si kye kikulu.
I was supposed to win.	Nze nnali wa kuwangula.
You will do it.	Ojja kukikola.
Everyone should read this.	Buli muntu alina okusoma bino.
Not money right now.	Si ssente mu kiseera kino.
But he can talk.	Naye asobola okwogera.
He didn't have much to help.	Yali talina nnyo kuyamba.
And he won’t do it.	Era tajja kukikola.
I can do it better than you.	Nsobola okukikola okusinga ggwe.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
Not at all.	N’akatono.
And this was a normal thing.	Era kino kyali kintu kya bulijjo.
No one actually says that.	Mu butuufu tewali ayogera bw’atyo.
No one really wants to do that.	Ekyo tewali ayagala ddala kukikola.
No, no, no, no.	Nedda, nedda, nedda.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
It’s really quite simple.	Ddala kyangu nnyo.
Only I can do it.	Nze nzekka asobola okukikola.
He continued in.	Yagenda mu maaso mu.
He did it.	Yakikola.
You can talk to me.	Oyinza okwogera nange.
Someone has to do it.	Omuntu alina okukikola.
Maybe he was just being himself.	Mpozzi yali abeera ye kennyini yekka.
In this case, it is.	Mu mbeera eno, bwe kiri.
I didn’t know you had a car.	Nze nali simanyi nti olina mmotoka.
That and that there is someone with me.	Ekyo era nti waliwo omuntu nange.
And he was very, very strong.	Era yali wa maanyi nnyo, nnyo.
In practice this is quite simple.	Mu nkola kino kyangu nnyo.
But it was early.	Naye nga bukyali.
His wife was in the bedroom asleep.	Mukyala we yali mu kisenge nga yeebase.
He certainly didn’t want to be here.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala kubeera wano.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
Something is in the room with us.	Ekintu kiri mu kisenge naffe.
He certainly is.	Mazima ddala y’ali.
Today, it seems normal.	Leero, kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
Then he knew.	Awo n’amanya.
I guess it’s just him.	Ntebereza nti ye yekka.
Indeed, why not.	Mazima ddala, lwaki nedda.
But there is one problem.	Naye waliwo ekizibu kimu.
He was still very happy.	Yali akyali musanyufu nnyo.
And, in a way, it was.	Era, mu ngeri emu, bwe kyali.
Basically?	Mu bwangu?
I can't.	Sisobola.
You have to help.	Olina okuyamba.
I was, too, at the time.	Nange nnali, mu kiseera ekyo.
', he is '.	', ali '.
But they are there.	Naye bali awo.
We are very close friends.	Tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
Really good book.	Ddala ekitabo kirungi.
That’s really a problem.	Ekyo ddala kizibu.
And it is good in almost every aspect.	Era kirungi kumpi mu buli nsonga.
Actually.	Mazima.
We’ll see what happens.	Tujja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
Something here no man can do.	Ekintu wano tewali musajja asobola kukola.
That’s what it is, it’s not.	Ekyo kye kiri, si bwe kiri.
He told me he couldn’t stay long.	Yang’amba nti tasobola kumala bbanga ddene.
The issue is in a serious state.	Ensonga eri mu mbeera ya maanyi.
And they are.	Era bwe bali.
I want this.	Kino njagala.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Mpozzi, mpozzi, mpozzi.
I need help.	Nneetaaga obuyambi.
I certainly hope he does.	Mazima ddala nsuubira nti akola bw’atyo.
I don’t want that either.	Ekyo nange saagala.
This is true for everyone.	Kino kituufu eri buli muntu.
But not really, maybe.	Naye si bwe kiri mu butuufu, mpozzi.
Now it will soon be fine.	Kati mu bbanga ttono kijja kuba kirungi.
I wish you could do this every day.	Njagala nnyo singa kino osobola okukikola buli lunaku.
I’m going to drive a car.	Ngenda kuvuga mmotoka.
Maybe we will.	Mpozzi tujja kukikola.
But, it is what it is.	Naye, kye kiri.
I probably won’t get to see one.	Oboolyawo sijja kufuna kulaba emu.
No relationship is too strong.	Tewali mukwano gwa maanyi nnyo.
He had no choice, not really.	Yali talina kya kukola, si ddala.
The problem with him.	Ekizibu ku ye.
Anything he asked for.	Ekintu kyonna kye yasaba.
Everyone was talking.	Buli omu yali ayogera.
He must talk to.	Ateekwa okwogera ne.
No one should live like that.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kubeerawo bw’atyo.
He didn’t know who it was.	Yali tamanyi ani.
This product is great!	Ekintu kino kirungi nnyo!
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
I was so beautiful.	Nnali mulungi nnyo.
That seems complicated.	Ekyo kirabika nga kizibu.
He wants to be here.	Ayagala kubeera wano.
That is very important to us.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
All but one.	Byonna okuggyako omu.
But everything will be fine.	Naye buli kimu kijja kuba kirungi.
It’s not for everyone.	Si kya buli muntu.
I was expecting it too.	Nange nnali nsuubira.
He doesn’t have the money.	Talina ssente.
It doesn’t seem to be true.	Kirabika si kituufu.
You don’t have to make a movie.	Tolina kukola firimu.
You are so lucky.	Oli wa mukisa nnyo.
Like now, here with you.	Nga kati, wano naawe.
You can’t be mine.	Tosobola kuba wange.
No, that was serious.	Nedda, ekyo kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
To the object.	Eri ekintu.
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
Opinion doesn’t matter.	Endowooza si nsonga.
He didn’t really need to.	Mu butuufu yali teyeetaaga.
I was in the classroom.	Nnali mu kibiina.
It was a process.	Yali nkola.
However, that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Kyokka, kirabika ekyo si bwe kiri.
But there is a problem like this.	Naye waliwo ekizibu nga kino.
Obviously, they are not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe bali.
I was happy.	Nali musanyufu.
He certainly would be.	Mazima ddala yandibadde bw’atyo.
I actually know that.	Mu butuufu ekyo nkimanyi.
I want to do this right.	Kino njagala kukikola bulungi.
He tried, he really tried.	Yagezaako, ddala yagezaako.
How long do you have to stay.	Olina okumala bbanga ki.
He told me that .	Yangamba nti .
His wife.	Mukyala we.
This is nothing like that.	Kino si kintu nga ekyo.
Now it’s true.	Kati kituufu.
It's almost here.	Kiri kumpi wano.
It was very common.	Kyali kya bulijjo nnyo.
It won’t be a problem.	Tekijja kuba kizibu.
He hoped she would come.	Yalina essuubi nti ajja kujja.
He was not the child she needed to be.	Si ye yali mwana gwe yali yeetaaga okuba.
This here, and there and there.	Kino wano, ne wali ne wali.
Though himself almost.	Wadde nga ye kennyini kumpi.
Not very common, to say the least.	Si wa bulijjo nnyo, okugamba nti.
This house is beautiful.	Ennyumba eno nnungi nnyo.
He started living with her.	Yatandika okubeera naye.
I was on the floor.	Nali wansi.
I didn’t know they were there.	Nze nali simanyi nti bali awo.
But it’s true.	Naye kituufu.
But you are a human being.	Naye ggwe oli muntu.
I don’t know why or when.	Simanyi lwaki oba ddi.
Speaking was dangerous.	Okwogera kyali kya bulabe.
That alone is not true.	Ekyo kyokka si kituufu.
We can’t do it.	Tetusobola kukikola.
I need to be here.	Nze nneetaaga okubeera wano.
It’s not a good practice.	Si nkola nnungi.
He didn’t want to talk to me.	Yali tayagala kwogera nange.
As usual, she looked great.	Nga bulijjo, yalabika bulungi nnyo.
Happy to talk about anything.	Musanyufu okwogera ku kintu kyonna.
I just work here.	Nze nkola wano kyokka.
Of course, my car was fine.	Kya lwatu nti mmotoka yange yali nnungi.
But there was nothing to see.	Naye nga tewali kya kulaba.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
You really were when you were.	Ddala wali bwe wali.
I have it too.	Nnina nange.
All in time.	Byonna mu budde.
And nobody heard anything.	Era tewali yawulira kintu kyonna.
Even if he wanted to.	Ne bwe yali ayagala.
It was too busy for us.	Yali bbize nnyo gye tuli.
Here it was.	Wano we kyali.
But he was fine.	Naye yali bulungi.
And you know, it was really good.	Era omanyi, kyali kirungi ddala.
Then he had nothing.	Awo yali talina ky’alina.
He will do it.	Ajja kukikola.
But he got one.	Naye yafuna emu.
That wasn’t him.	Oyo si ye yali.
My father knew what was going on.	Taata yali amanyi ekigenda mu maaso.
I'll do something like that.	Nja kukola ekintu nga ekyo.
But it really isn’t.	Naye ddala si bwe kiri.
Everything is there.	Buli kimu kiri awo.
Not himself.	Si ye kennyini.
This book was very difficult, but not difficult.	Ekitabo kino kyali kizibu nnyo, naye nga si kizibu.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
No it was true.	Nedda kyali kituufu.
But just a little bit.	Naye katono ddala.
Here is his chance.	Wano we wali omukisa gwe.
From now on.	Okuva kati.
It was very beautiful.	Yali nnungi nnyo.
She always looks good at parties.	Bulijjo alabika bulungi ku mbaga.
He has the beauty.	Alina obulungi.
I’m not at home.	Nze siri waka.
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
But they are not.	Naye si bwe bali.
He would have to deal with it right now.	Yandibadde alina okukikola ku nsonga eno mu kiseera kino.
He had been here before.	Yali abadde wano emabegako.
That’s so bad!	Ekyo kibi nnyo!
No one seems to know the truth.	Alabika tewali amanyi mazima.
I’m not entirely sure.	Sikakasa ddala.
Apparently he was.	Kirabika yali...
I will be his wife.	Nja kuba mukyala we.
You can do this too.	Kino naawe osobola okukikola.
Why not continue with .	Lwaki togenda mu maaso ne .
Not that week.	Si wiiki eyo.
He doesn’t have anyone.	Talina muntu yenna.
He probably knew his wife better than anyone else.	Oboolyawo yali amanyi nnyo mukyala we okusinga omuntu omulala yenna.
Nothing seemed so important now.	Tewali kyali kirabika nga kikulu nnyo kati.
Today it is not the same.	Leero si kye kimu.
You may not like this and that’s not so bad.	Kino oyinza okuba nga tolina ky’oyagala era ekyo si kibi nnyo.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si ekyo kyokka.
So he did it.	Bwatyo bwe yakola.
He doesn’t have the money.	Talina ssente.
You are good to me too.	Naawe oli mulungi gyendi.
You don’t have to do everything.	Tolina kukola buli kimu.
Everything is excellent.	Buli kimu kirungi nnyo.
But it’s not good.	Naye si kirungi.
He will be here.	Ajja kuba wano.
As it is, it is.	Nga bwe kiri.
See! 	Okulaba!
Good job.	Omulimu omulungi.
I don’t think anyone really does.	Sirowooza nti ddala waliwo omuntu yenna akikola.
Everyone wants for the money!	Buli omu ayagala ku ssente!
I will do that.	Ekyo nja kukikola.
You’ll probably be fine.	Oboolyawo ojja kuba bulungi.
Very quickly.	Mu bwangu nnyo.
Too easy, he thought.	Kyangu nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
I know nothing about myself.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nze.
That is his position.	Ekyo kye kifo kye.
But it was him.	Naye yali ye.
I'll be.	Nja kuba.
He seems happy anyway.	Alabika nga musanyufu mu ngeri yonna.
More than anyone else.	Okusinga buli omu.
He spoke very quickly.	Yayogera mangu nnyo.
It won’t be a problem at all for me.	Tekijja kuba buzibu n’akatono gyendi.
But I don’t think so.	Naye nze si kituufu.
He needed to go home.	Yali yeetaaga okudda eka.
Not mine, not normal.	Si yange, si ya bulijjo.
But he could do nothing himself.	Naye ye kennyini yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
It won’t drive.	Tekijja kuvuga.
But that’s still not what you want.	Naye ekyo n’okutuusa kati si ky’oyagala.
Certainly not one of us.	Mazima ddala si omu ku ffe.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
Happy.	Musanyufu.
I don't know what the problem is.	Simanyi buzibu ki.
It was very real.	Kyali kya ddala nnyo.
He had none of this.	Yali talina kintu kyonna ku bino.
He says that.	Agamba nti.
I thought it might be a problem, but it wasn't.	Nnali ndowooza nti kiyinza okuba ekizibu naye si bwe kyali.
It was a very dangerous situation for me.	Yali mbeera ya bulabe nnyo gyendi.
I was always in trouble.	Bulijjo nnali mu buzibu.
You have to do this.	Kino olina okukikola.
That, in a sense, he has.	Ekyo, mu ngeri emu, ky’alina.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He says he can’t believe it.	Agamba nti tasobola kukkiriza.
No one knew quite what to do.	Tewali yali amanyi bulungi kye yandikoze.
That was in his opinion.	Ekyo kyali mu ndowooza ye.
It's coming.	Kijja.
That was a bad idea.	Ekyo kyali kirowoozo kibi.
This is for the patient.	Kino kya mulwadde.
He should have been in school.	Yandibadde mu ssomero.
The point is that.	Ensonga eri nti.
But that one.	Naye oyo omu.
He had hope	Yalina essuubi
Today it would be difficult though.	Leero kyandibadde kizibu wadde.
And that’s not my point.	Era eyo si y’ensonga yange.
He was that much happier.	Yali musanyufu nnyo bw’atyo.
However, this is not a problem.	Kyokka kino si kizibu.
What you want to do.	Kye oyagala okukola.
That's all?	Ekyo kyokka?
Where are we going today?	Tugenda wa leero?
This is very dangerous.	Kino kya bulabe nnyo.
You can, you know.	Osobola, omanyi.
And in this way you are.	Era mu ngeri eno gy’oli.
He shouldn’t have done that either.	Ekyo naye yali tasaanidde kukikola.
He is afraid, and for good reason.	Atya, era alina ensonga.
There is hope.	Waliwo essuubi.
It was busy from morning till night.	Yali bbize okuva ku makya okutuuka ekiro.
Like my father.	Nga taata wange.
And he did it.	Era yakikola.
But there isn’t much time for that.	Naye ekyo tewali budde bungi.
Or it may be the case.	Oba kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
I deserve it.	Nze nsaanidde.
Now you can do whatever you want.	Kati osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
I don’t need anything.	Sirina kye nneetaaga.
That’s not what it is.	Ekyo si kye kiri.
He could go to the police.	Yali asobola okugenda ku poliisi.
I really have no problem.	Mazima ddala sirina buzibu.
But this I can say.	Naye kino nsobola okwogera.
On the way.	Ku tugenda.
But you can see immediately that’s not true.	Naye osobola okulaba amangu ddala ekyo si kituufu.
Who knows where.	Ani amanyi wa.
I was very young.	Nnali muto nnyo.
He was afraid of the dog.	Yali atya embwa eyo.
I am moving on tomorrow.	Ngenda mu maaso enkya.
Apparently they were just here.	Kirabika baali wano kyokka.
All in a very short time, too.	Byonna mu bbanga ttono nnyo, era.
I don’t think that’s true.	Ekyo sirowooza nti kituufu.
I just wanted to talk to you.	Nnali njagala kwogera naawe kyokka.
You think about it.	Olowooza ku nsonga eyo.
He was obviously interested.	Kya lwatu nti yali ayagala nnyo.
This is everyone’s favorite.	Kino buli omu ky’ayagala ennyo.
And no one was without it.	Era tewali muntu yenna yali talina.
This is not what we need.	Kino si kye twetaaga.
I hope this can help any.	Nsuubira nti kino kiyinza okuyamba kyonna.
I'm not sure what it was.	Sikakasa kiki kye kyali.
And that’s absolutely true.	Era ekyo kituufu ddala.
We have to do something, he said.	Tulina kye tulina okukola, bwe yagambye.
Perhaps he felt the same way.	Oboolyawo naye yawulira bw’atyo.
I couldn’t really do such a thing, of course.	Mu butuufu nnali sisobola kukola kintu ng’ekyo, ddala.
I think it would be very difficult.	Ndowooza kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
I’ve lost hope.	Nze nfunye essuubi.
I'm sure, like me.	Nkakasa, nga nze.
Maybe there’s a chance.	Mpozzi nga waliwo omukisa.
He's mine.	Ye wange.
That just wasn’t us.	Ekyo kyokka si kye kyali ffe.
You know you’re really good.	Omanyi ddala oli mulungi.
I’m not in this for the money.	Siri mu kino lwa ssente.
He couldn’t be sick.	Yali tasobola kuba mulwadde.
My dear friend.	Mukwano gwange omulungi.
You are doing very well.	Okola bulungi nnyo.
I need to do it.	Nze nneetaaga okukikola.
I’m not in jail.	Nze siri mu kkomera.
He knew what it was now.	Yali amanyi kye kyali kati.
I just know, he is all.	Nze mmanyi kyokka, ye byonna.
And it was just so beautiful.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo kyokka.
This is not the case here.	Kino si bwe kiri wano.
It was just there.	Kyali awo kyokka.
However, money is not everything.	Kyokka ssente si buli kimu.
You’ve been very busy.	Obadde bbize nnyo.
This is very close.	Kino kiri kumpi nnyo.
But mostly for myself.	Naye okusinga ku nze kennyini.
It’s what he loves.	Kye ky’ayagala ennyo.
He in the movie was very happy.	Ye mu firimu yali musanyufu nnyo.
Not now, not yet.	Si kati, si n’okutuusa kati.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
And that’s right.	Era ekyo kituufu.
A long time.	Ebbanga ddene.
You don’t matter now.	Tolina kikulu kati.
Everything he was.	Buli kimu kye yali.
We will be back soon.	Tujja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
It is very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo.
He looks young.	Alabika nga muto.
And yet, it was here.	Era naye, kyali wano.
He thought he would be good at it.	Yalowooza nti ajja kuba mulungi mu nsonga eyo.
No one looked good.	Tewali yali alabika bulungi.
He was a good friend of mine.	Yali mukwano gwange mulungi.
This picture is very complicated.	Ekifaananyi kino kizibu nnyo.
It goes on and on.	Kigenda mu maaso ne kigenda mu maaso.
We have to get out of here.	Tulina okuva wano.
It’s not a place to go in a hurry.	Si kifo kya kugenda mu bwangu.
It’s not just this.	Si kino kyokka.
We will win.	Tujja kuwangula.
All he had was a book.	Kye yali alina ekitabo.
It’s still as simple as that.	N’okutuusa kati kyangu nga ekyo.
It’s hard to make a phone call.	Kizibu okukuba essimu.
But, here we are.	Naye, wano we tuli.
It won’t matter.	Tekijja kuba kikulu.
But he would, he hoped.	Naye yandibadde, bwe yali asuubira.
Not now, anyway.	Si kati, mu ngeri yonna.
He and his girlfriend were best friends.	Ye ne muganzi we baali ba mukwano nnyo.
I don’t know which side.	Simanyi ludda ki.
Person .	Omuntu .
Nothing to do, nothing to do.	Tewali kya kukola, tewali kya kukola.
He tried but couldn't speak.	Yagezaako naye nga tasobola kwogera.
But he isn’t.	Naye si bw’atyo.
He does his job.	Akola omulimu gwe.
Something is happening here.	Wano waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
That alone will not do.	Ekyo kyokka tekijja kukola.
He needed help.	Yali yeetaaga obuyambi.
You can’t do everything.	Tosobola kukola buli kimu.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
But in all reality, that is not the case.	Naye mu butuufu bwonna, ekyo si bwe kiri.
Even for himself.	Ne ku ye kennyini.
It was real, though.	Kyokka kyali kya ddala.
With anyone, of course.	Nga waliwo omuntu yenna, ddala.
It probably won’t happen.	Oboolyawo tekijja kubaawo.
But he could see.	Naye yali asobola okulaba.
He was obviously unhappy with me.	Kya lwatu nti yali si musanyufu nange.
I, for the most part.	Nze, okusinga.
I couldn’t play.	Nnali sisobola kuzannya.
I have something to do.	Nnina kye nkola.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
There is no time.	Tewali budde.
I know more than you do.	Nze mmanyi bingi okusinga ggwe.
Everything, anything, that’s what we’re here for.	Buli kimu, ekintu kyonna, ekyo kye tuli wano.
That if he did, that would be it.	Nti singa yakola ekyo, ekyo kyandibadde.
Who lives here?	Ani abeera wano?
Reading is very important.	Okusoma kikulu nnyo.
Not for long, though.	Kyokka si lwa bbanga ddene.
It was just bad.	Kyali kibi kyokka.
Now we can drive.	Kati tusobola okuvuga.
I know he does.	Nkimanyi nti akola bw’atyo.
That’s an idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo.
And it’s fine if you were good.	Era kirungi singa wali mulungi.
i'll try that.	nja kugezaako ekyo.
One book at a time.	Ekitabo kimu ku kimu.
He doesn’t want a party or anything.	Tayagala kabaga oba ekintu kyonna.
I love a lot of things.	Njagala nnyo ebintu bingi.
He can do anything.	Asobola okukola buli kimu.
But we can’t allow it to happen.	Naye tetusobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
He is very dangerous.	Ye wa bulabe nnyo.
You have to know.	Olina okumanya.
But it’s not to be.	Naye si kya kubeera.
A week ago.	Wiiki emu emabega.
But it was hard to do.	Naye kyali kizibu okukikola.
At the location of.	Ku kifo we...
However, this is not the case here.	Kyokka wano si bwe kiri.
There's nothing in him yet.	Tewali kintu kyonna mu ye n'okutuusa kati.
I really need help with this.	Ddala nneetaaga obuyambi ku kino.
He wanted it, and only him.	Yali ayagala, era ye yekka.
And he wanted to.	Era yali ayagala.
I can’t wait with you.	Siyinza kulinda naawe.
Did you know that he is.	Obadde okimanyi nti ye.
It is next to nothing.	Kiri kumpi nga tewali kintu kyonna.
It’s probably everyone’s routine.	Oboolyawo nkola ya buli muntu.
I will do that this weekend.	Ekyo nja kukikola wiikendi eno.
The police, he loves the police.	Poliisi, ayagala nnyo poliisi.
Maybe who he was.	Mpozzi ani gwe yali.
And he knew where he lived, too.	Era yali amanyi gye yali abeera, naye.
Everyone wants money.	Buli muntu ayagala ssente.
I'm sure actually.	Nkakasa mu butuufu.
It is very important to read a lot.	Kikulu nnyo okusoma ennyo.
But that’s not the point.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga.
No, it’s not just that.	Nedda, si ekyo kyokka.
This is what he wanted.	Kino kye yali ayagala.
I’m in school.	Ndi mu ssomero.
They were just like him.	Baali nga bwe yali.
He loved it, of course.	Yali ayagala nnyo, ddala.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
In a sense, of course.	Mu ngeri emu, mazima ddala.
You think about absolutely everything.	Olowooza ku buli kimu ddala.
Not lucky?	Si wa mukisa?
Actually, it’s pretty simple.	Mu butuufu, kyangu nnyo.
It's just there.	Kiri awo kyokka.
I don’t know what it is.	Simanyi kiki.
I don’t think he had much.	Sirowooza nti yalina bingi.
But this is what it is.	Naye kino kye kiri.
His brother.	Muganda we.
I think that’s pretty cool.	Ndowooza ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I don’t want it in me.	Sikyagala mu nze.
Opportunity.	Omukisa.
He did a pretty good job of that.	Ekyo yakikola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
You’re coming with us.	Ojja naffe.
He must be .	Ateekwa okuba nga .
I'll wait.	Nja kulinda.
I have to go now.	Nnina okugenda kati.
You don’t have to, you know.	Tolina, omanyi.
He makes a point of that.	Ekyo akikola ensonga.
I will never be here again.	Sijja kuddamu kubeera wano.
Truly an artist to watch.	Mazima ddala muyimbi okulaba.
I wanted to move on.	Nnali njagala okugenda mu maaso.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
It’s going on.	Kigenda mu maaso.
I think they are, but maybe not for everyone.	Ndowooza nti bali, naye mpozzi si lwa buli muntu.
So far, I have one.	N’okutuusa kati, nnina emu.
He didn’t have to do that.	Ekyo yali talina kukikola.
I don’t like it here, you know.	Wano sikyagala, omanyi.
Whether you knew it or not.	Oba wali okimanyi oba nedda.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
One other guy was there with his wife.	Ggaayi omulala omu yali awo ne mukyala we.
He was very eloquent.	Yali ayogera bulungi nnyo.
He obviously didn't know what to do.	Kya lwatu nti yali tamanyi kya kukola.
And how happy he was to be with me.	Era nga yali musanyufu nnyo okubeera nange.
But I do.	Naye nze nkola.
And it was so easy.	Era nga kyangu nnyo.
Now he’s doing that.	Kati akola bw’atyo.
Are you sure you want to see this?	Okakasa nti oyagala kulaba kino?
And you only want one.	Era oyagala emu yekka.
I don’t have a car.	Nze sirina mmotoka.
That’s all I was.	Ekyo kyokka kye nnali.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
You would have gone without us.	Wandibadde ogenda nga tetulina.
I wanted to do it.	Nnali njagala kukikola.
This was my office.	Eno ye yali ofiisi yange.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
You can say anything.	Osobola okwogera ekintu kyonna.
That’s very important to me.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo gyendi.
To both of them.	Eri bombi.
It was totally up to us.	Kyali ku ffe ddala.
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
You have to move on.	Olina okugenda mu maaso.
In many cases.	Mu mbeera nnyingi.
Actually, this is not true.	Mu butuufu, kino si kituufu.
For one weekend.	Ku wiikendi emu.
Everyone said that.	Buli omu yagamba bw’atyo.
You can’t talk.	Tosobola kwogera.
And a good one, too.	Era omulungi, naye.
I am a knowledgeable person.	Ndi muntu alina okumanya.
I wanted to be human.	Nnali njagala kubeera muntu.
Very good, he said.	Kirungi nnyo, bwe yagambye.
No problem here.	Tewali buzibu wano.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
We’ll just have to see.	Tujja kumala kulaba.
He is a reasonable guy.	Ye ggaayi alina ensonga.
Now this is important.	Kati kino kikulu.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
He’s been busy.	Abadde bbize.
That was what he wanted himself.	Ekyo ye kennyini kye yali ayagala.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I was the one.	Nze nnali omu.
She was beautiful as always.	Yali mulungi nga bulijjo.
He must go now.	Ateekwa okugenda kati.
No one truly knows the truth.	Tewali muntu yenna amanyi mazima mu butuufu.
What are you doing?.	Okola ki?.
But now he couldn't.	Naye kati yali tasobola.
And that’s just not true.	Era ekyo kyokka si kituufu.
However, these are not necessarily the same thing.	Kyokka si nti ddala bino kintu kye kimu.
Not much.	Si bingi.
And then he would like to get lucky.	Era awo yandiyagadde okufuna omukisa.
It wasn’t, of course.	Si bwe kyali, ddala.
He didn’t want to do anything.	Yali tayagala kukola kintu kyonna.
My wife is a strong woman.	Mukyala wange mukyala wa maanyi.
If you were here.	Singa wali wano.
And he’s not going to do it.	Era tagenda kukikola.
It wasn’t the case.	Si bwe kyali.
He was everywhere in the house.	Yali buli wamu mu nnyumba.
Perhaps you were at work.	Oboolyawo wali ku mulimu.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nnali simanyi kiki.
He has been doing that a lot.	Ekyo abadde akikola nnyo.
He won’t be able to live without me.	Tajja kusobola kubeerawo nga sirina.
Whatever he was going to say will have to wait.	Kyonna kye yali agenda okwogera kijja kulinda.
We'll see.	Tujja kulaba.
For that man.	Ku musajja oyo.
And it was good to think.	Era kyali kirungi okulowooza.
We can do it, and we will.	Tusobola okukikola, era tujja kukikola.
Good if you continue.	Kirungi singa ogenda mu maaso.
No one knew anything.	Tewali yali amanyi kintu kyonna.
This early in the morning.	Kino ku makya ennyo.
Maybe a little younger.	Mpozzi nga muto katono.
I will be ready.	Nja kuba mwetegefu.
I'm not, but I'm not very manly either.	Siri, naye nange siri musajja nnyo.
I am just like everyone else.	Ndi nga buli muntu omulala yenna.
Right, you know.	Kituufu, omanyi.
I just know he isn’t.	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti si bw’atyo.
You’re the only one.	Oli wekka ggwe.
From the job.	Okuva mu mulimu.
I don’t have anything or any way.	Sirina kintu kyonna oba engeri yonna.
Right now she doesn’t want him.	Mu kiseera kino tayagala ye.
It was really happening.	Ddala kyali kigenda mu maaso.
Who says that?	Ani agamba bw’atyo?
He is my brother.	Ye muganda wange.
If only he knew.	Singa yali amanyi kyokka.
I thought it was really good.	Nalowooza nti ddala kirungi.
This may be true.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
Your point is that.	Ensonga yo eri nti.
I still don't know what to do.	Nze n'okutuusa kati simanyi kya kukola.
But in the short term.	Naye mu bbanga ttono.
It’s not always a good thing.	Si kintu kirungi bulijjo.
There is no point to your argument.	Tewali nsonga yonna ku nsonga yo.
He didn't quite know how to answer.	Yali tamanyi bulungi ngeri ya kuddamu.
I'm going to.	Nze njagala.
I think we should move on.	Ndowooza tusaanidde okugenda mu maaso.
But, but, but.	Naye, naye, naye.
I didn’t have it.	Nze nnali sirina.
From his home.	Okuva awaka we.
He can barely see.	Asobola bulungi okulaba.
He needed strength.	Yali yeetaaga amaanyi.
Yeah, he knew who.	Ye, yali amanyi ani.
Both at the same time.	Bombi mu kiseera kye kimu.
No one knew what he did in there alone.	Tewali yali amanyi kye yakola mu eyo yekka.
That is true in many cases.	Ekyo kituufu mu mbeera nnyingi.
It will be very, very good.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo nnyo.
Maybe it really is.	Mpozzi ddala bwe kiri.
I can’t do it.	Nze sisobola.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
That's why it's so good.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki kirungi nnyo.
This is just one thing.	Kino ekintu kimu kyokka.
Nothing is easy here.	Wano tewali kintu kyangu.
He has time, and lots of it.	Alina obudde, era bungi nnyo.
I’m glad you’re okay.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli bulungi.
Honestly, it seems a little low to me.	Mu butuufu, kirabika nga kya wansi katono gyendi.
I just didn’t think this would work.	Nze nnali sirowooza nti kino kijja kukola.
Even today.	N’okutuusa leero.
I had no choice in the matter.	Nnali sirina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo.
It’s going to happen.	Kigenda kubaawo.
I wanted to do something difficult.	Nnali njagala okukola ekintu ekizibu.
I want to know everything.	Njagala kumanya buli kimu.
But that’s not a bad thing.	Naye ekyo si kibi.
I know it in myself.	Nze nkimanyi mu nze.
It’s hard for me to drive.	Kizibu gyendi okuvuga.
I can’t do much.	Sisobola kukola bingi.
If for a little while.	Singa okumala akaseera katono.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo yakikola.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
I will do it too.	Nange nja kukikola.
I still don’t know.	Nze n’okutuusa kati simanyi.
No one did it anyway.	Tewali yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
That’s all,’ he said.	Ekyo kyokka,’ bwe yagambye.
I really have.	Ddala nnina.
That’s the right thing to do.	Kye kituufu.
That was a good thing.	Ekyo kyali kirungi.
I am his friend.	Nze mukwano gwe.
It’s in everything, everywhere.	Kiri mu buli kimu, buli wamu.
You are my friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange.
I think we have to work.	Ndowooza tulina okukola.
No one should have done that.	Ekyo tewali yandibadde akikola.
And it’s pretty good.	Era kirungi nnyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
No one knows why.	Tewali amanyi lwaki.
He doesn't have anything.	Talina ky'alina.
I know you know how.	Nkimanyi nti omanyi engeri.
He didn't know why.	Yali tamanyi lwaki.
He will be with me.	Ajja kubeera nange.
I love it so much.	Nze njagala nnyo.
In my practice.	Mu nkola yange.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
I feel so lucky.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa nnyo.
I live here now.	Nze mbeera wano kati.
And he was basically the one talking.	Era okusinga ye yali ayogera.
But it probably isn’t.	Naye osanga si bwe kiri.
One for each of us.	Omu ku buli omu ku ffe.
Today, you’re the only one.	Leero, ggwe wekka.
I desperately needed money.	Nnali nneetaaga nnyo ssente.
I can’t say much about it here yet.	Siyinza kwogera bingi ku nsonga eno wano n’okutuusa kati.
You go, you.	Ggwe ogenda, ggwe.
I don’t really know.	Mu butuufu simanyi.
Very friendly too.	Mukwano nnyo era.
Someone will answer.	Waliwo ajja okuddamu.
We’re going to have dinner.	Tugenda okulya ekyeggulo.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
This is where the problem lies.	Wano obuzibu we buli.
No one wants to be that guy.	Tewali ayagala kubeera ggaayi oyo.
Of course, he had.	Kya lwatu nti yalina.
I really couldn’t believe how close this was.	Mazima ddala nnali siyinza kukkiriza ngeri kino gye kyali kumpi.
Now we are friends.	Kati tuli ba mukwano.
No one lives here now.	Tewali abeera wano kati.
Maybe we should go swimming.	Mpozzi tusaanidde okugenda okuwuga.
He knows his brother.	Amanyi muganda we.
Everyone started talking.	Buli omu yatandika okwogera.
And that’s terrible.	Era ekyo kibi nnyo.
He knew what he did.	Yali amanyi kye yakola.
But that would be too easy.	Naye ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
He is the best of all of us.	Ye asinga ffenna.
No luck yet.	Tewali mukisa n'okutuusa kati.
He needed to be alone.	Yali yeetaaga okubeera yekka.
And he wasn’t dangerous .	Era yali si wa bulabe .
It was his time.	Kyali kiseera kye.
I want to read the book.	Njagala okusoma ekitabo.
Anything can happen.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo.
I really didn’t want anything.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kintu kyonna.
You’re so young.	Oli muto nnyo.
Probably for the money.	Oboolyawo lwa ssente.
He had one too many.	Yalina emu nga nnyingi nnyo.
This is what we have to do.	Kino kye tulina okukola.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
It’s going on.	Kigenda mu maaso.
But now you are mine.	Naye kati oli wange.
Just as he expected.	Nga bwe yali asuubira.
I absolutely love it.	Njagala nnyo ddala.
I would like help to achieve this.	Njagala obuyambi okutuuka ku kino.
I loved it at the time.	Nnali njagala nnyo mu kiseera ekyo.
Tonight, you’re going to help.	Ekiro kya leero, ogenda kuyamba.
The guy is fine.	Ggaayi ali bulungi.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
I can do it myself.	Nsobola okukikola nzekka.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
Apparently, it’s my job.	Kirabika, gwe mulimu gwange.
It won’t do anything.	Tekijja kukola kintu kyonna.
Of course, he does.	Kya lwatu nti akola bw’atyo.
I know that for a reason.	Ekyo nkimanyi lwa nsonga.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
Any help? 	Obuyambi bwonna?
And everyone wants to get better.	Era buli muntu ayagala nnyo okufuna obulungi.
And it’s very important.	Era kikulu nnyo.
He did his job.	Yakola omulimu gwe.
And that would be, frankly, really nice.	Era ekyo kyandibadde, mu butuufu, kirungi ddala.
Right now at this point.	Kati mu kiseera kino.
But what he did.	Naye kye yakola.
It’s playing with him.	Kuba kuzannya naye.
Everything was the same.	Buli kimu kyali kye kimu.
It’s not the time.	Si kiseera.
He was here a while ago.	Yali wano akaseera katono emabega.
He was completely alone.	Yali yekka ddala.
The other one was me.	Omulala nnali nze.
You don’t want to.	Toyagala.
He can’t even know.	Tasobola na kumanya.
I can’t go back to this.	Siyinza kudda mu kino.
He would do almost anything she asked.	Yandikoze kumpi buli kimu kye yasaba.
This was really good.	Kino kyali kirungi ddala.
Both of them.	Bombi bombi.
I love things.	Njagala nnyo ebintu.
That’s not an issue for you.	Eyo si nsonga gy’oli.
He's doing really well.	Akola bulungi ddala.
And we’re going to win.	Era tugenda kuwangula.
It was awkward, awkward, awkward.	Kyali kizibu, kizibu, kizibu.
But there was no plan.	Naye nga tewali nteekateeka yonna.
He had it now.	Yalina kati.
You’re not alone.	Si ggwe wekka.
I knew we were unlucky.	Namanya nti tetulina mukisa.
I have experienced something like that myself.	Nze kennyini nfunye ekintu ng’ekyo.
Not too long ago.	Si bbanga ddene nnyo.
He's fine.	Ali bulungi.
But that's talk.	Naye ebyo kwogera.
And it might just be true.	Era kiyinza okuba nga kituufu kyokka.
You don’t have to do it.	Tolina kukikola.
And she doesn’t really want to be him.	Era tayagala nnyo kubeera ye.
But for everyone.	Naye ku lwa buli muntu.
He knew he shouldn't.	Yali akimanyi nti tasaanidde kukikola.
He said he has.	Yagambye nti alina...
I was being good about it.	Nali mbeera mulungi ku nsonga eyo.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
Nothing really important.	Tewali kikulu nnyo.
Anyone can do that.	Ekyo omuntu yenna asobola okukikola.
He needed to know.	Yali yeetaaga okumanya.
But no one could.	Naye tewali yali asobola.
Who was who.	Ani yali ani.
And, of course, he was very young.	Era, ddala, yali muto nnyo.
For him, for himself.	Ku ye, ku ye kennyini.
I didn’t know where we were.	Nnali simanyi gye twali.
He was working.	Yali akola.
He was alone.	Yali yekka.
That’s a hard thing to answer.	Ekyo kintu kizibu okuddamu.
I have a dog, and it’s great.	Nnina embwa, era nnungi nnyo.
I was happy as can be.	Nali musanyufu nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
There is nothing in the car.	Tewali kintu kyonna mu mmotoka.
He looked so young.	Yalabika nga muto nnyo.
He had to know.	Yalina okumanya.
I wanted to be with you, to see why.	Nnali njagala kubeera naawe, okulaba lwaki.
I’m so scared.	Nze ntya nnyo.
He says why.	Agamba lwaki.
And there's no reason to think anyone will now.	Era tewali nsonga lwaki alowooza nti waliwo omuntu yenna ajja kukikola kati.
They were absolutely everywhere.	Baali ddala buli wamu.
It’s a way.	Kye ngeri.
But he was fast asleep.	Naye yali yeebase nnyo.
He couldn't do that now.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukikola kati.
And it’s pretty normal.	Era kirungi kya bulijjo.
And everyone, actually.	Era buli muntu, mu butuufu.
I am nothing without a house.	Nze siri kintu nga tewali nnyumba.
I need to talk to him.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye.
I just wanted to be me.	Nnali njagala kubeera nze kyokka.
Not doing anything.	Obutakola kintu kyonna.
Apparently he must have.	Kirabika alina okuba nga yalina.
Had to get back in the car to get that.	Yalina okudda mu mmotoka okufuna ekyo.
I think we need that.	Ndowooza ekyo twetaaga.
It was definitely good to see.	Mazima ddala kyali kirungi okulaba.
He could do with her what he wanted.	Yali asobola okukola naye ekyo kye yali ayagala.
But now, it’s a real problem for you.	Naye kati, kizibu kya ddala gy’oli.
More than enough actually.	Okusinga okumala mu butuufu.
He looked younger.	Yalabika nga muto.
This is what you wanted, isn’t it?	Kino kye wali oyagala, si bwe kiri?
I'm afraid.	Nze ntya.
But something in me had to do it.	Naye waliwo ekintu mu nze kyalina okukikola.
I think that’s only going to continue.	Ndowooza ekyo kigenda kugenda mu maaso kyokka.
It was just beautiful.	Kyali kirungi kyokka.
he was curious.	yali ayagala okumanya.
This thing will work, right?	Ekintu kino kijja kukola, nedda?
I know exactly where it is.	Nze mmanyi bulungi gye kiri.
Nobody seems to want to do that.	Ekyo kirabika tewali ayagala kukikola.
That may happen consciously or unconsciously.	Ekyo kiyinza okubaawo mu kumanya oba nga tomanyi.
It’s not necessarily a good thing.	Si kituufu nti kintu kirungi.
Maybe he really was sick.	Mpozzi ddala yali mulwadde.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
It would be like .	Kyandibadde nga .
From what? 	Okuva ku ki?
You don’t even know.	Tomanyi na.
But he doesn’t have to.	Naye talina kukikola.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
Soon, we’ll talk.	Mu bbanga ttono, tujja kwogera.
There is a reason.	Waliwo ensonga.
He has no idea what to do.	Talina kirowoozo kyonna ku ky’alina okukola.
It won’t be enough.	Tekijja kumala.
This is really quite simple.	Kino ddala kyangu nnyo.
Nobody even knows about the guy.	Tewali amanyi na ku ggaayi.
Actually, nothing.	Mu butuufu, tewali kintu kyonna.
But you’re young.	Naye ggwe oli muto.
It was beautiful there.	Kyali kirungi nnyo eyo.
No one can.	Tewali asobola.
This was the night.	Kino kye kyali ekiro.
And my father.	Ne taata wange.
He was just trying to help.	Yali agezaako buyambi buyambi.
You don’t have anyone here for this either.	Tolina muntu yenna wano ku kino naawe.
However, this is not the case here.	Kyokka wano si bwe kiri.
He accepted everyone.	Yakkiriza buli muntu.
But not for long.	Naye si lwa bbanga ddene.
In every way.	Mu buli ngeri.
I know happy he might have been.	Nkimanyi musanyufu yandiba nga yali.
As he would have done.	Nga bwe yandikoze.
It was just everything.	Kyali buli kimu kyokka.
It was just the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu kyokka.
He was in desperate need of help.	Yali yeetaaga nnyo obuyambi.
This is a very serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I really said that.	Nze ddala nagamba nti.
That other one .	Oyo omulala .
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
He won’t do it, he can’t.	Tajja kukikola, tasobola.
And he wants to know, too.	Era naye ayagala okumanya.
Actually, there is nothing wrong with that.	Mu butuufu, tewali kizibu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
In fact, this is true.	Mu butuufu, kino kituufu.
He really had no choice.	Mazima ddala yali talina kya kukola.
But you were there.	Naye ggwe wali awo.
That will work just fine.	Ekyo kijja kukola bulungi nnyo.
What day is it today?	Leero lunaku ki?
To say the least.	Okugamba nti.
But he could do this.	Naye kino yali asobola okukikola.
I’m so scared.	Nze ntya nnyo.
Something is, or isn’t.	Ekintu kiri, oba si bwe kiri.
But it isn’t either.	Naye era si bwe kiri.
There really is nothing I can do.	Mazima ddala tewali kye nnyinza kukola.
I wanted more than that.	Nnali njagala okusinga ekyo.
In this way.	Mu ngeri eno.
I still don’t care.	Nze n’okutuusa kati sifaayo.
Everyone was young.	Buli omu yali muto.
Anyone.	Omuntu yenna.
I was behind him.	Nze nnali emabega we.
I have my own car.	Nnina mmotoka yange.
Want to know my opinion?	Oyagala okumanya endowooza yange?
He had to do what he had to do.	Yalina okukola ekyo kye yalina okukola.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
I want to talk to you.	Njagala okwogera naawe.
He's doing what he wants now.	Akola ky'ayagala kati.
Where are we going.	Tugenda wa.
Maybe he really did.	Mpozzi ddala yakikola.
Maybe that’s not a bad thing though.	Mpozzi ekyo si kibi wadde.
But that is not the case with you.	Naye si bwe kiri ku ggwe.
In every case.	Mu buli mbeera.
He wanted to go.	Yali ayagala kugenda.
That was probably too good to be true.	Oboolyawo ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
Nobody wants anything.	Tewali ayagala kintu kyonna.
It’s really pretty cool.	Ddala kirungi nnyo.
That thing is complicated.	Ekintu ekyo kizibu.
I always do that.	Bulijjo nkola ekyo.
Good job on this one!.	Omulimu omulungi ku guno!.
Now it was worse.	Kati kyali kibi nnyo.
He's always been such a good kid.	Bulijjo abadde mwana mulungi bwatyo.
He came to the wedding with my brother.	Yajja ku mbaga ne muganda wange.
However, I was ready.	Kyokka nnali mwetegefu.
There is no way we are home.	Tewali ngeri yonna gye tuli waka.
But he does do so.	Naye akola bw’atyo.
But he knew he had to do something.	Naye yali akimanyi nti alina ky’alina okukola.
That wasn’t my point.	Ekyo si kye kyali ensonga yange.
He was basically my best friend.	Okusinga yali mukwano gwange asinga.
We just have to stay in the car.	Tulina kumala kusigala mu mmotoka.
I feel better too.	Nange mpulira bulungi.
I have been home all week.	Mbadde waka wiiki yonna.
We’re in one now.	Tuli mu kimu kati.
We can’t do it alone.	Tetusobola kukikola ffekka.
It likely won’t happen soon.	Kirabika tekijja kubaawo mangu.
No, there is no plan.	Nedda, tewali nteekateeka.
It could be absolutely anything really.	Kiyinza okuba nga kintu kyonna ddala mazima ddala.
Everyone needs to do that.	Ekyo buli muntu yeetaaga okukikola.
There was no way he could make leave now.	Tewali ngeri gye yali asobola kukola kugenda kati.
This is very important to us.	Kino kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
This is what we are together.	Kino tuli wamu.
Getting to a certain point.	Okutuuka ku nsonga emu.
I think this is true.	Ndowooza kino kituufu.
He's just been asleep.	Abadde yeebase kyokka.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
That may be the case.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
And he will do it.	Era ajja kukikola.
I had experienced so much.	Nnali nfunye bingi nnyo.
I can do this without my father.	Kino nsobola okukikola nga taata sirina.
And you know why.	Era omanyi lwaki.
But that was last week.	Naye eyo yali wiiki ewedde.
It’s happening now.	Kigenda mu maaso kati.
We have to be.	Tulina okuba nga tuli.
He goes to his office every day.	Agenda mu ofiisi ye buli lunaku.
I feel his product will be very important.	Mpulira ekintu kye kijja kuba kikulu nnyo.
I don’t have much time this afternoon.	Akawungeezi ka leero sirina budde bungi.
He said that he was.	Yagamba nti yali.
I needed help.	Nnali nneetaaga obuyambi.
That was important now.	Ekyo kyali kikulu kati.
But of course.	Naye ddala.
In practice, however, it is very difficult to do this.	Kyokka mu nkola kizibu nnyo okukola kino.
Everything and everyone.	Buli kimu na buli muntu.
He says that it is.	Agamba nti bwe kiri.
That thing is dangerous.	Ekintu ekyo kya bulabe.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
I'm leaving very soon'.	Nze ngenda mangu ddala'.
I hope he does.	Nsuubira nti akikola.
I couldn’t stay.	Nnali sisobola kusigala.
Exactly the same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu ddala.
We need to move forward.	Twetaaga okugenda mu maaso.
Here they are.	Wano we bali.
He has a friend who loves him.	Alina mukwano gwe ayagala.
And maybe that’s the point.	Era osanga eyo y’ensonga.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
He loves every kind.	Ayagala nnyo buli ngeri.
I have no idea how to go about doing this.	Sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso nga nkola kino.
Dogs at night at night.	Embwa ekiro ekiro.
No, you don’t have to.	Nedda, tolina kukikola.
Not in a week.	Si mu wiiki emu.
He was good asleep.	Yali mulungi nga yeebase.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
They are so close now.	Bali kumpi nnyo kati.
I want to be the best.	Njagala kubeera asinga.
I am so sick of this.	Nze ensonga eno ndi mulwadde nnyo.
He was my father.	Yali taata wange.
I guess it would be something like that.	Ntebereza nti kyandibadde kintu ng’ekyo.
I have to go.	Nnina okugenda.
Not a good place to be.	Si kifo kirungi okubeera.
I have been working on him.	Mbadde nkola ku ye.
Not much, but a little.	Si bingi, naye katono.
But we are ourselves.	Naye ffe ffe kennyini.
Not so much for me.	Si nnyo nnyo gyendi.
I’m fine with that.	Nze ekyo ndi bulungi.
It's his car.	Ye mmotoka ye.
Don’t come with us.	Tojja naffe.
He was the power.	Ye yali amaanyi.
I’m afraid to talk to him again.	Ntya okuddamu okwogera naye.
I have every reason.	Nnina buli nsonga.
I am not human with everyone.	Nze siri muntu na buli muntu.
I was in a good mood.	Nnali mu mbeera nnungi.
I’ve been in the hospital.	Mbadde mu ddwaaliro.
Not now, too early.	Si kati, nga bukyali nnyo.
No one really knew what was going on.	Tewali yali amanyi ddala kigenda mu maaso.
In fact, they were here.	Mu butuufu, baali wano.
Stuff like this you know.	Ebintu nga bino omanyi.
He didn’t need it.	Yali teyeetaaga.
I really had no idea.	Mu butuufu nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
Effort.	Amaanyi.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
It’s my room now.	Kye kisenge kyange kati.
Everyone knows that, and everyone knew it at the time.	Ekyo buli omu akimanyi, era mu kiseera ekyo buli omu yali akimanyi.
Probably none, actually.	Oboolyawo tewali, mu butuufu.
I love my brother so much.	Njagala nnyo muganda wange.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
Here's where it goes.	Wano we kigenda.
And we are.	Era ffe.
You can’t say anything.	Tosobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
He may not be there.	Kiyinza okuba nga tajja kubaawo.
There is only one problem.	Waliwo ekizibu kimu kyokka.
No strength in close proximity.	Tewali maanyi mu kumpi.
He is an optimist!	Ye muntu alina essuubi!
He's not a man.	Si musajja.
You have to act now.	Olina okukola kati.
It is very close.	Kiri kumpi nnyo.
It’s hard to think about that now.	Kizibu okulowooza ku ekyo kati.
I won’t answer.	Sijja kuddamu.
I know you’re coming.	Nkimanyi nti ojja.
I could certainly see this happening.	Mazima ddala nnali nsobola okulaba nga kino kigenda mu maaso.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
It was a friendly one.	Kyali kya mukwano.
It was very sudden.	Kyali kya mangu nnyo.
It’s not realistic.	Si kya ddala.
The night was difficult.	Ekiro kyali kizibu.
That’s not your issue.	Ekyo si nsonga yo.
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
I knew this was true.	Namanya nti kino kyali kituufu.
Together, we can do this.	Nga tuli wamu, kino tusobola okukikola.
But that’s not a bad thing.	Naye ekyo si kibi.
In practice, no.	Mu nkola, nedda.
It is the process.	Ye nkola.
Not eating, of course.	Si kulya, ddala.
We need to think that way.	Tulina okulowooza mu ngeri eyo.
But of course he had.	Naye ddala yalina.
I knew it well enough.	Nali nkimanyi bulungi.
Something like that.	Ekintu nga ekyo.
Exactly like him.	Ddala nga ye.
That was it, he thought.	Ekyo kye kyali, bwe yalowooza.
He wants to do it for you.	Ayagala kukikola gy’oli.
I love this concept.	Njagala nnyo endowooza eno.
If he had been.	Singa yali abadde.
One person can’t play every role.	Omuntu omu tasobola kuzannya buli kifo.
I’m pretty sure we will.	Nkakasa bulungi nti tujja kukikola.
I was a local.	Nnali muntu wa wano.
Like this morning.	Nga enkya ya leero.
Like, rather like, like.	Nga, okusinga nga, nga.
We could see anything.	Twali tusobola okulaba ekintu kyonna.
He is a human being.	Ye muntu.
I can’t today.	Sisobola leero.
He is good and fast.	Mulungi era wa bwangu.
Apparently he wasn’t.	Kirabika si ye yali.
I didn’t even know what it was.	Nnali simanyi na kye kyali.
Everyone said that.	Buli omu yagamba bw’atyo.
She looked good, she said.	Yalabika bulungi, bwe yagambye.
You are not alone in this.	Si ggwe wekka mu kino.
And a good one, at that.	Era omulungi, ku ekyo.
I don’t have the money.	Sirina ssente.
I know that he knows.	Nkimanyi nti amanyi.
Pretty good, actually.	Kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
Whose is this?	Kino kya ani?
A picture, of course.	Ekifaananyi, ddala.
Don’t come to my room.	Tojja mu kisenge kyange.
At a time like this, too.	Mu kiseera nga kino, era.
It is truly a beautiful city.	Mazima ddala kibuga kirungi nnyo.
But, my phone.	Naye, essimu yange.
I am in the present moment.	Nze ndi mu kiseera kino.
Critical thinking is very important.	Okulowooza obulungi kikulu nnyo.
I can’t live without you.	Siyinza kubeera nga tolina ggwe.
He’s going to be in everything.	Agenda kubeera mu buli kimu.
That’s basically what it was.	Ekyo okusinga kye kyali.
But it was very difficult.	Naye kyali kizibu nnyo.
It can happen again.	Kiyinza okuddamu okubaawo.
And what one needs.	Era omuntu kye yeetaaga.
It was what he expected.	Kyali kye yali asuubira.
This is now.	Kino kiri kati.
Soon we will be at the wedding.	Mu bbanga ttono tujja kuba ku mbaga.
He had nothing to do.	Yali talina kya kukola.
I really really want to.	Ddala ddala njagala.
He is a good singer.	Muyimbi mulungi.
I am not sick.	Siri mulwadde.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika nga mulungi nnyo.
I'm not sure about that.	Sikakasa ku ekyo.
Can you answer that?	Ekyo oyinza okuddamu?
And then what.	Era awo kiki.
What should we do? 	Kiki kye tusaanidde okukola?
This attitude is not faith.	Endowooza eno si kukkiriza.
I want to be real.	Njagala okuba nga wa ddala.
Really, really good.	Ddala, ddala kirungi.
I am very, very good.	Nze ndi mulungi nnyo nnyo.
It’s in the office.	Eri mu ofiisi.
He is working now.	Akola kati.
He wants to be there again.	Ayagala kuddamu kubeerawo.
He absolutely had to be.	Yalina ddala okuba bw’atyo.
Getting to watch a movie.	Okufuna okulaba firimu.
It was a thing of the past.	Kyali kintu kya dda.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Sikakasa buzibu ki bwe buli.
And he was young.	Era yali muto.
I think it will work.	Ndowooza kijja kukola.
Where are we going?	Tugenda wa?
You don’t have any plans.	Tolina nteekateeka yonna.
It’s easy to see why.	Kyangu okulaba ensonga lwaki.
One person can’t play every role.	Omuntu omu tasobola kuzannya buli kifo.
Definitely a dog.	Mazima ddala embwa.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
I should definitely do that.	Ekyo nsaanidde okukikola ddala.
This arrangement is ideal for weddings.	Enteekateeka eno nnungi nnyo ku mbaga.
We were together almost all the time.	Twali ffembi kumpi buli kiseera.
It was something.	Kyali kintu.
It’s for everyone.	Kya buli muntu.
That is certainly true.	Mazima ekyo kituufu.
I know who it is.	Nze mmanyi ani.
And this is why.	Era eno y’ensonga lwaki.
I’m doing pretty well.	Nze nkola bulungi nnyo.
He had to know everything.	Yalina okumanya buli kimu.
But nobody does that.	Naye ekyo tewali akikola.
That will be good.	Ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
You can do anything really.	Osobola okukola ekintu kyonna ddala.
But he won’t do it.	Naye tajja kukikola.
It was very easy to do.	Kyali kyangu nnyo okukikola.
It won’t happen anyway.	Tekijja kubaawo mu ngeri yonna.
Something here is not quite right.	Ekintu wano si kituufu ddala.
I have something to say.	Nnina kye njagala okwogera.
But now you know.	Naye kati omanyi.
I had no choice.	Nnali sirina kya kukola.
You are a human being.	Oli muntu.
I feel very happy.	Mpulira nga ndi musanyufu nnyo.
He thought no one knew.	Yalowooza nti tewali amanyi.
And so he did.	Era bw’atyo bwe yakola.
And you know, we can’t do this too much.	Era omanyi, kino tetusobola kukikola nnyo.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
I thought it was you.	Nalowooza nti ggwe.
And in fact, he had to make the movie.	Era mu butuufu, yalina okukola firimu eyo.
He didn’t need to be there.	Yali teyeetaaga kubeerawo.
He didn't know what he wanted to say.	Yali tamanyi kye yali ayagala kwogera.
It was really difficult.	Ddala kyali kizibu.
We will do it.	Tujja kukikola.
He is not dangerous.	Si wa bulabe.
We down here.	Ffe wansi wano.
He went with her quickly.	Yagenda naye mu bwangu.
I can and will do it.	Nsobola era nja kukikola.
I can do this.	Kino nsobola okukikola.
It’s not an easy thing.	Si kintu kyangu.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
But, that’s what’s happening.	Naye, ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso.
You were in the same issue as me.	Ggwe wali mu nsonga nga nze.
In fact, he doesn't have a job either.	Mu butuufu naye talina mulimu.
This seems to be true.	Kino kirabika nga kituufu.
No one knows the reason.	Tewali amanyi nsonga.
He really didn’t have time.	Mazima ddala yali talina budde.
It was all he could do.	Kye kyokka kye yali asobola okukola.
He is much stronger.	Asinga nnyo amaanyi.
I am sure you will do very well.	Nkakasa nti ojja kukola bulungi nnyo.
He is in a hurry.	Ali mu bwangu.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
There is only one problem.	Waliwo ekizibu kimu kyokka.
He really said that.	Ddala yayogera bw’atyo.
As he did.	Nga bwe yakola.
This is a very serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
Good job on this!.	Omulimu omulungi ku kino!.
And he had been.	Era yali abadde.
It was something to say.	Kyali kintu kya kwogera.
And then he said.	Era awo n’agamba nti.
Everyone will step back.	Buli omu ajja kudda emabega.
That's the whole point for them.	Eyo y'ensonga yonna gye bali.
That is what it is today.	Ekyo kye kiri leero.
He was home and always would be.	Yali waka era bulijjo yandibadde.
He had been good to me.	Yali abadde mulungi gyendi.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
Be.	Okubeera.
I'm actually pretty good.	Mu butuufu ndi bulungi nnyo.
I can’t do it alone.	Sisobola kukikola nzekka.
It’s hard to say.	Kizibu okwogera.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
I don’t even know what it is.	Simanyi na kye kiri.
This was going to happen quickly.	Kino kyali kigenda kubaawo mu bwangu.
You can’t tell.	Tosobola kumanya.
Just the same thing .	Ekintu kye kimu kyokka .
Not anything like that.	Si kintu kyonna nga ekyo.
I want to keep doing that.	Njagala kusigala nga nkola ekyo.
It was a difficult time.	Kyali kiseera kya buzibu.
Not good so far.	Si kirungi okutuusa kati.
It was the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu.
It’s just as easy.	Kye kimu kyangu.
We need to win.	Twetaaga okuwangula.
I thought it wasn’t.	Nnalowooza nti si bwe kiri.
No one knew what to do.	Tewali yali amanyi kya kukola.
It’s not an idea.	Si kirowoozo.
And also that .	Era era nti .
He is in the speaking.	Ali mu kwogera.
He is facing that way.	Ayolekedde bw’atyo.
I’m sure he has.	Nkakasa nti alina.
It seems very difficult.	Kirabika kizibu nnyo.
It will work.	Kijja kukola.
Everyone in town seems friendly.	Buli muntu mu kibuga alabika wa mukwano.
It’s not like that though.	Si bwe kiri wadde.
Not that he could.	Si nti yali asobola.
And we will do that.	Era ekyo tujja kukikola.
He wanted to see his friend.	Yali ayagala kulaba mukwano gwe.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
I already knew that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi dda.
But he couldn’t do it.	Naye nga tasobola kukikola.
Perhaps he was afraid too.	Oboolyawo naye yali atya.
I know how to win.	Nze mmanyi okuwangula.
Now he was very interested.	Kati yali ayagala nnyo.
You have to do that yourself.	Ekyo olina okukikola ggwe kennyini.
But perhaps it’s not as complicated as it sounds.	Naye mpozzi si kizibu nga bwe kirabika.
Now he would be there until morning.	Kati yandibadde awo okutuusa ku makya.
He felt the whole thing.	Yawulira ekintu kyonna.
No problem there.	Tewali buzibu eyo.
I know that he knows.	Nkimanyi nti amanyi.
You don’t want to be like him.	Toyagala kubeera nga ye.
Was he expecting?	Yali asuubira?
It was a terrible time.	Kyali kiseera kibi nnyo.
Why is this happening?	Lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso?
Everyone wants to play every day.	Buli muntu ayagala kuzannya buli lunaku.
You do the same thing.	Naawe okola ekintu kye kimu.
We will help as much as we can.	Tujja kuyamba nga bwe tusobola.
I have things to do.	Nnina ebintu bye nnina okukola.
And it was my home.	Era yali waka wange.
a little while.	akaseera katono.
This is not true, obviously.	Kino si kya mazima, kya lwatu.
I’m sorry about all this, you know.	Nsonyiwa bino byonna, omanyi.
That will be something to watch.	Ekyo kijja kuba kya kulaba.
And he knew I was too.	Era yali akimanyi nti nange nze.
The issues are the issues.	Ensonga ze nsonga.
It really had it all.	Ddala kyalina byonna.
Either way, he said more than he should have.	Mu ngeri yonna, yayogera bingi okusinga bwe yandibadde ayogera.
He's on her.	Ali ku ye.
That's basically what it is.	Ekyo okusinga kye kiri.
What do you have?.	Ggwe olina ki?.
He needs to regain his strength.	Yeetaaga okuddamu okufuna amaanyi.
He knew he couldn’t win.	Yali akimanyi nti tasobola kuwangula.
We are here, and we will stay here.	Tuli wano, era tujja kusigala wano.
I said that’s true.	Nagamba nti ekyo kituufu.
We can win again.	Tusobola okuddamu okuwangula.
And he probably had been.	Era oboolyawo yali abadde.
That just wasn’t it.	Ekyo kyokka si kye kyali.
I just want it.	Nze njagala kyokka.
We need both of them.	Twetaaga bombi.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe yali.
Maybe all of that.	Mpozzi ebyo byonna.
This is a very good job.	Guno mulimu mulungi nnyo.
I needed to get home and make dinner.	Nnali nneetaaga okutuuka awaka ne nkola ekyeggulo.
Anyone can say that.	Omuntu yenna asobola okwogera bw’atyo.
That’s pretty much what seems to be happening.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo kye kirabika nga kigenda mu maaso.
And.	Ne.
He was happy.	Yali musanyufu.
He knew better.	Yali asinga okumanya.
You would be dangerous.	Wandibadde wa bulabe.
Everyone was happy.	Buli omu yali musanyufu.
Maybe he’s too strong.	Mpozzi nga wa maanyi nnyo.
He didn’t know his reasons.	Yali tamanyi nsonga ze.
This may have been true.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kyali kituufu.
He didn’t have it.	Yali talina.
I don’t think he was.	Sirowooza nti yali.
This thing is very complicated.	Ekintu kino kizibu nnyo.
All he needed would be there, and plenty of it.	Kye yali yeetaaga kyandibadde awo, era nga bingi.
The only thing.	Ekintu kyokka.
That is not the case here.	Ekyo si bwe kiri wano.
I’m already doing it.	Nze nkola dda.
This is, of course, not true.	Kino, kya lwatu, si kituufu.
He was a doctor by profession.	Yali musawo mu mulimu gwe.
But he wasn’t.	Naye ye si bwe yali.
That’s what’s going on here.	Ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso wano.
Nothing would be easy.	Tewali kyandibadde kyangu.
He had been gone.	Yali abadde agenda.
Who knows, it might work.	Ani amanyi, kiyinza okukola.
It is a very good idea.	Kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
But of course he would.	Naye ddala yandikoze.
I didn’t know what he was doing.	Nnali simanyi kye yali akola.
We have it down.	Tulina wansi.
The thing you want is there.	Ekintu ky’oyagala kiri awo.
I don’t know if it’s true or not.	Simanyi oba kituufu oba nedda.
You are really beautiful.	Ddala oli mulungi.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
And yet, he started a little.	Era naye, yatandika katono.
But he did, and it was.	Naye yakikola, era bwe kyali.
He will do very well.	Ajja kukola bulungi nnyo.
This is not true at all.	Kino si kituufu n’akatono.
He really wanted to go.	Yali ayagala nnyo okugenda.
I don’t want to do it.	Saagala kukikola.
It was a chore.	Yali mulimu gwa kukola.
I thought there was something.	Nalowooza nti waliwo ekintu.
This is a very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
He loves his father very much.	Ayagala nnyo taata we.
It would be much easier that way.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo mu ngeri eyo.
I have to talk to him.	Nnina okwogera naye.
This was his point.	Eno ye yali ensonga ye.
Not my friend.	Si mukwano gwange.
What did he say?	Kiki kye yayogera?
I didn’t know why or how.	Nnali simanyi lwaki oba ngeri ki.
He knows why.	Amanyi ensonga lwaki.
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
But he did it about it.	Naye ye yakikola ku nsonga eyo.
This is complicated, and complicated.	Kino kizibu, era kizibu.
I wasn’t going to say anything.	Nze nali sigenda kwogera kintu kyonna.
Please consider this.	Nsaba okulowooza ku nsonga eno.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
He’s a really nice guy.	Ddala ggaayi mulungi.
He didn’t want anything.	Yali talina ky’ayagala.
He says she is his friend.	Agamba nti ye mukwano gwe.
You fear for yourself.	Otya ku ggwe kennyini.
I have to help.	Nnina okuyamba.
It’s love.	Kye kwagala.
In here.	Mu wano.
It won’t be enough.	Tekijja kumala.
There are	Waliwo e
All in good time.	Byonna mu budde obulungi.
Here's the thing.	Wano ekintu.
It was bad all right.	Kyali kibi byonna bulungi.
And .	Ne .
It wasn’t him.	Si ye yali.
Knowing that he has.	Okumanya nti alina.
It’s what we need more than anything.	Kye twetaaga okusinga ekintu kyonna.
I’m not entirely sure.	Sikakasa ddala.
In almost every way.	Kumpi mu buli ngeri yonna.
We can do better.	Tusobola okukola obulungi.
You just can’t.	Ggwe kyokka tosobola.
He knows that.	Ekyo akimanyi.
It was either him or us.	Yali ye oba ffe.
He was speaking quickly.	Yali ayogera mu bwangu.
I was good, though.	Kyokka nnali mulungi.
Seems like a nice guy.	Kirabika nga ggaayi omulungi.
He couldn’t talk to me.	Yali tasobola kwogera nange.
He talked like it, too.	Yayogera nga bwe kiri, naye.
Now you can get anything.	Kati osobola okufuna ekintu kyonna.
I wish he was here.	Njagala yandibadde wano.
He wasn’t well.	Yali si bulungi.
You have to	Olina
Everyone was busy.	Buli omu yali bbize.
He could not continue his work.	Yali tasobola kugenda mu maaso na mulimu gwe.
He looked good to me.	Yalabika bulungi gyendi.
That was close.	Ekyo kyali kumpi.
I think you’re really on to something here.	Ndowooza ddala oli ku kintu wano.
My father couldn’t tell.	Taata yali tasobola kumanya.
He was definitely what she didn’t need.	Mazima ddala yali kye yali teyeetaaga.
I know everything.	Nze buli kimu nkimanyi.
For a while.	Okumala akaseera.
We are moving forward.	Tugenda mu maaso.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nnali simanyi kye kyali.
Like, from everything.	Nga, okuva ku buli kimu.
He doesn’t want her to look like that.	Tayagala alabika bw’atyo.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
I thought it was a great idea.	Nalowooza nti kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I really have to work on that.	Ekyo ddala nnina okukola ku nsonga eyo.
It just wasn’t mine.	Kyali si kyange kyokka.
You can do it and you will.	Osobola okukikola era ojja kukikola.
He has to be fine.	Alina okuba bulungi.
Whatever it is.	Kyonna kye kiri.
He obviously loves it.	Kya lwatu nti ayagala nnyo.
I don’t know where it could have gone.	Simanyi gye kyandibadde kigenda.
I feel like a child.	Mpulira nga ndi mwana muto.
But he can’t.	Naye tasobola.
We have to act now.	Tulina okukola kati.
He must act quickly.	Ateekwa okukola mu bwangu.
That’s really the point here.	Eyo ddala y’ensonga wano.
You need to know what that is.	Olina okumanya ekyo kye ki.
I know that really well.	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi ddala.
Which is exactly what he was.	Ekintu ddala kye yali.
He wanted to go but couldn’t.	Yali ayagala okugenda naye nga tasobola.
You might say that.	Oyinza okugamba nti.
I have the money.	Nnina ssente.
Money I don’t want.	Ssente ze saagala.
I’m here for the baby.	Nze ndi wano ku lwa mwana.
He had time to do it.	Yalina obudde okukikola.
She was alone in the house with him.	Yali yekka mu nnyumba naye.
It’s something to behold.	Kintu kya kulaba.
So far everything looks good.	N’okutuusa kati buli kimu kirabika bulungi.
This will be easy.	Kino kijja kuba kyangu.
No one knew anything.	Tewali yali amanyi kintu kyonna.
The point is that.	Ensonga eri nti.
Probably even today.	Oboolyawo ne leero.
That was very difficult for me.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo gyendi.
Much less powerful.	Katono nnyo okusinga amaanyi.
In this room.	Mu kisenge kino.
However, he is not at all.	Kyokka, si ye n’akatono.
There is no speech.	Tewali kwogera.
He wasn’t supposed to be there with us.	Yali talina kuba naffe eyo.
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okukikola.
I can go alone.	Nsobola okugenda nzekka.
I didn’t know.	Nnali mmanyi.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
I was very busy.	Nnali bbize nnyo.
I'm asking for help.	Nsaba obuyambi.
You're not going to find someone who wants everything you want.	Togenda kufuna muntu ayagala buli kimu ky'oyagala.
I couldn’t see.	Nnali sisobola kulaba.
So far no one can.	N’okutuusa kati tewali asobola.
The only problem is us.	Obuzibu bwe ffe ffekka.
But he would like one.	Naye yandiyagadde emu.
He didn't quite know why.	Yali tamanyi bulungi nsonga lwaki.
That’s exactly what it is.	Ekyo ddala bwe kiri.
I thought it might be him.	Nalowooza nti yandiba nga ye ye.
I absolutely do.	Nze nkola ddala.
I want to know who did it.	Njagala kumanya ani yakikola.
He would like that.	Ekyo yandiyagadde.
I’m sure there’s nothing there.	Nkakasa nti tewali kintu kyonna awo.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He was so much more than that.	Yali asinga nnyo ekyo.
I’m in my office.	Nze ndi mu ofiisi yange.
Here's mine.	Wano wange.
I feel great now.	Mpulira nnyo kati.
He can’t do anything.	Tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
You are strong.	Oli wa maanyi.
For real for real for real.	Ku lwa ddala ku lwa ddala ku lwa ddala.
It seems so simple.	Kirabika nga kyangu nnyo.
He had no idea where.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna wa.
And for that matter.	Era ku nsonga eyo.
However, there is an issue with this.	Kyokka waliwo ensonga ku nsonga eno.
I really need to talk to him.	Nneetaaga nnyo okwogera naye.
He wanted to wait.	Yali ayagala kulinda.
In fact, he is.	Mu butuufu y’ali.
Quickly, he thought.	Mu bwangu, bwe yalowooza.
He is here with us.	Ali wano naffe.
Way.	Engeri.
This is certainly true.	Kino mazima ddala kituufu.
I know what you want.	Nze mmanyi ky’oyagala.
But that’s not for everyone.	Naye ekyo si kya buli muntu.
I hope you are happy.	Nsuubira nti oli musanyufu.
It may last a week or three weeks.	Kiyinza okumala wiiki emu oba wiiki ssatu.
He has a plan for us, you know.	Alina enteekateeka gye tuli, omanyi.
I can’t even eat.	Nze sisobola na kulya.
I am that person.	Nze omuntu oyo.
Everybody knows everybody.	Buli muntu amanyi buli muntu.
Or we, or.	Oba ffe, oba.
And no one did about it.	Era tewali yakikola ku nsonga eyo.
I feel better already.	Mpulira bulungi dda.
I wanted to talk to you.	Nnali njagala okwogera naawe.
You know what they are.	Omanyi kye bali.
It certainly is there.	Mazima ddala kiri awo.
It is very easy to read.	Kyangu nnyo okusoma.
So far, nothing.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali kintu kyonna.
He does it every day.	Akikola buli lunaku.
He will definitely do it.	Ajja kukikola ddala.
The same problem exists here.	Ekizibu kye kimu kiri wano.
It is a state of being.	Kye mbeera ya kubeerawo.
No one is very happy.	Tewali musanyufu nnyo.
I wonder if he was one.	Nneebuuza oba yali omu.
You are my son, she said.	Oli mwana wange, bwe yagamba.
It’s very, very bad.	Kibi nnyo nnyo.
That was a great idea.	Ekyo kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I couldn’t believe he could be that good.	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti asobola okuba omulungi bw’atyo.
Yeah, yeah.	Ye ye.
I wonder who it is.	Nze nneebuuza ani.
I was like.	Nze nali nga.
He had a brother.	Yalina muganda we.
But not in the room.	Naye si mu kisenge.
That’s what everyone wants.	Ekyo buli omu ayagala.
That had to go away.	Ekyo kyalina okugenda.
It seems to you alone.	Kirabika gy’oli wekka.
There is a house	Waliwo ennyumba
Maybe it is.	Mpozzi bwe kiri.
My father knew this.	Kino taata yali akimanyi.
Or he should have done.	Oba yandibadde akola.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
Everyone was fine.	Buli omu yali bulungi.
And soon you are gone.	Era mu bbanga ttono oba ogenda.
He had his phone, he said.	Yalina essimu ye, bwe yagambye.
We don’t even have to stay.	Tetulina na kusigala.
I am very good at my job.	Ndi mulungi nnyo mu mulimu gwange.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
He could leave at any time.	Yali asobola okugenda essaawa yonna.
And that was that.	Era ekyo kye kyali ekyo.
I don’t know if we’re at that point yet.	Simanyi oba tuli mu kiseera ekyo n’okutuusa kati.
Of course he can.	Kya lwatu ayinza.
It was there before.	Kyali awo emabegako.
We have dinner.	Tulina ekyeggulo.
I can do that better than him.	Ekyo nsobola okukikola okusinga ye.
She had to talk to him.	Yalina okwogera naye.
In fact, he does.	Mu butuufu, akola bw’atyo.
Going to.	Okugenda ku.
He can hardly wait.	Tasobola bulungi kulinda.
You need to do this in advance.	Kino olina okukikola nga bukyali.
I'm fine, really.	Ndi bulungi, ddala.
But that was great for me.	Naye ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo gyendi.
Nothing, and nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna, era tewali.
I don’t belong to anyone.	Siri wa muntu yenna.
It might actually work.	Mu butuufu kiyinza okukola.
He loved his job.	Yali ayagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
He knows something is going on.	Amanyi nti waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
No how, no way.	Nedda ngeri ki, tewali ngeri.
I know you are my son.	Nkimanyi nti oli mwana wange.
Now it’s very difficult .	Kati kizibu nnyo .
Nobody says that.	Tewali ayogera bw’atyo.
I don’t really know anything about it.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo mu butuufu.
You have to turn that thing off.	Olina okuggyako ekintu ekyo.
What kind of person is he.	Muntu wa ngeri ki.
I didn’t know at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi.
But there isn’t.	Naye tewali.
Nothing goes right tonight.	Tewali kigenda bulungi ekiro kino.
And honestly, it’s really good.	Era mu butuufu, ddala kirungi.
Not that you won’t already.	Si nti tojja kukikola dda.
Exactly the same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu ddala.
He couldn't really see anything.	Mu butuufu yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
It will be difficult.	Kijja kuba kizibu.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
I know that it is not.	Nkimanyi nti si bwe kiri.
In fact, he was a good friend.	Mu butuufu, yali wa mukwano mulungi.
He agreed to talk to me.	Yakkiriza okwogera nange.
I hope it goes well.	Nsuubira nti kigenda bulungi.
It will be good for you.	Kijja kuba kirungi gy’oli.
But that is not the case at all.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
He is in you.	Ali mu ggwe.
You can’t help everyone.	Tosobola kuyamba buli muntu.
But that wasn’t all he was.	Naye ekyo kyokka si kye yali.
He didn't want to know now.	Yali tayagala kumanya kati.
I love a lot of things.	Njagala nnyo ebintu bingi.
It’s great to work on this problem myself.	Kirungi nnyo okukola ku kizibu kino nze kennyini.
And he isn’t.	Era si bw’atyo.
But it was easy.	Naye kyali kyangu.
But apparently that’s a problem.	Naye kirabika ekyo kizibu.
This was actually happening.	Kino mu butuufu kyali kigenda mu maaso.
There is no place like home.	Tewali kifo nga waka.
That’s in the morning.	Ekyo kiri ku makya.
He doesn’t need to answer.	Teyeetaaga kuddamu.
He didn't really want to talk about it.	Mu butuufu yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
For this reason.	Ku nsonga eno.
In this case it was a good thing.	Mu mbeera eno kyali kintu kirungi.
He doesn’t need to do that.	Teyeetaaga kukola ekyo.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
It’s not like you have to do it every day.	Si nga olina okukikola buli lunaku.
He is not just ordinary.	Si wa bulijjo yekka.
It’s in the air.	Kiri mu bbanga.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali.
He probably didn’t have time to go.	Oboolyawo yali talina budde kugenda.
But it will happen.	Naye kijja kubaawo.
I don’t want that to be me.	Saagala nti nze.
I don’t want that.	Ekyo saagala.
That was the point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga.
Anything to win.	Ekintu kyonna okuwangula.
Maybe he was asleep.	Mpozzi nga yeebase.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
To the object.	Eri ekintu.
What are you doing tonight?	Okola ki ekiro kino?
You’re not alone.	Si ggwe wekka.
Unusual.	Si kya bulijjo.
However, it was true.	Kyokka, kyali kituufu.
I can't find a way to do it.	Sisobola kufuna ngeri gye nnyinza kukikola.
The house was very nice.	Ennyumba yali nnungi nnyo.
I couldn’t even try.	Nnali sisobola na kugezaako.
And everyone knew this.	Era kino buli omu yali akimanyi.
He has to work.	Alina okukola.
I know how to do that.	Ekyo nkimanyi okukikola.
They were fine.	Baali bulungi.
But probably not.	Naye oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
I am sure you will do well!.	Nkakasa nti ojja kukola bulungi!.
This is an excellent option.	Eno nkola nnungi nnyo.
However, I don’t think you will.	Kyokka sirowooza nti ojja kukikola.
It’s going very well.	Kigenda bulungi nnyo.
Now, on to why you are here.	Kati, ku nsonga lwaki oli wano.
Don’t go too fast.	Togenda mangu nnyo.
He is working up to this point.	Akola okutuuka ku ssaawa eno.
But I don't know how to do it.	Naye simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukikola.
I will do that.	Ekyo nja kukikola.
I am so glad you are here.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti oli wano.
We’re close now.	Tuli kumpi kati.
I don’t know how to do it.	Simanyi ngeri gye nkola.
I don’t want this.	Kino saagala.
All at the same time.	Byonna mu kiseera kye kimu.
I knew that was you.	Namanya nti oyo ggwe.
He was happy.	Yali musanyufu.
He needed another one.	Yali yeetaaga omulala.
However, there are limitations to this approach.	Kyokka waliwo obuzibu mu nkola eno.
It is obviously very important.	Kya lwatu nti kikulu nnyo.
But he wanted to.	Naye yali ayagala.
They were both very strong.	Bombi baali ba maanyi nnyo.
But in front he was.	Naye mu maaso yali.
You think you know what you want.	Olowooza omanyi ky’oyagala.
I know what it is but that doesn’t matter.	Nkimanyi kye kiri naye ekyo si kikulu.
I didn’t know anything.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi.
In the house.	Mu nnyumba.
Difficult for anyone, perhaps.	Kizibu eri omuntu yenna, mpozzi.
There is nothing to say.	Tewali kya kwogera.
You can always talk to me.	Bulijjo osobola okwogera nange.
I’m glad you’re here.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano.
He didn’t think he would.	Yali talowooza nti ajja kukikola.
He saw things.	Yalaba ebintu.
We have to go.	Tulina okugenda.
He would have been there.	Yandibadde awo.
You have to work your way.	Olina okukola mu ngeri yo.
We’ll all go.	Ffenna tujja kugenda.
And you are the one.	Era ggwe oli.
I don't think that.	Ekyo sirowooza nti.
He can earn much more money than I can.	Asobola okufuna ssente nnyingi nnyo okusinga nze.
No knowing what might happen.	Tewali kumanya kiyinza kubaawo.
He didn’t want to go.	Yali tayagala kugenda.
No one knows.	Tewali amanyi.
I'm there for you.	Nze ndi awo.
He knew a lot about that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi bingi.
If it weren’t for me.	Singa si nze.
He was very busy.	Yali bbize nnyo.
But that is normal in most cases.	Naye ekyo kya bulijjo okusinga mu buli mbeera.
And who knows, maybe it is.	Era ani amanyi, mpozzi bwe kiri.
I know it was you.	Nkimanyi nti wali ggwe.
There is another one.	Waliwo omulala.
I didn’t think you were.	Nnali sirowooza nti ggwe wali.
He excels in this.	Asinga mu kino.
And it is the same.	Era bwe kiri.
And we’re not the only ones.	Era si ffe ffekka.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
I just need a little bit.	Nze nneetaaga katono ddala.
It is real and fast.	Kya ddala era kya bwangu.
He couldn’t do anything.	Yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
Why me? 	Lwaki nze?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I am not to speak.	Siri wa kwogera.
I think this is a great movie.	Ndowooza nti eno firimu nnungi nnyo.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si ekyo kyokka.
But he should have known better.	Naye yandibadde asinga okumanya.
Maybe he’ll get lucky.	Mpozzi ajja kufuna omukisa.
There is nothing there.	Tewali kintu kyonna awo.
And he knows it.	Era akimanyi.
This is the point.	Eno y'ensonga.
And it still isn’t.	Era n’okutuusa kati si bwe kiri.
No one can do it alone.	Tewali asobola kukikola yekka.
Maybe he's busy.	Mpozzi ali bbize.
I want to know what he said.	Njagala okumanya bye yayogera.
My son is like that.	Mwana wange bw’atyo.
That issue is now.	Ensonga eyo eri kati.
This is a difficult thing.	Kino kintu kizibu.
But that’s not a problem.	Naye ekyo si kizibu.
He has this.	Alina kino.
He saw his friend every day.	Yalaba mukwano gwe buli lunaku.
He was here a while ago.	Yali wano akaseera katono emabega.
But he goes on.	Naye agenda mu maaso.
The problem is very complicated.	Obuzibu buzibu nnyo.
Only I can do this.	Nze nzekka asobola okukola kino.
He had to do it now.	Yalina okukikola kati.
And he didn’t seem to know what was going on.	Era yalabika nga tamanyi kigenda mu maaso.
Everything is as real as it is now.	Buli kimu kya ddala nga bwe kiri kati.
He's a 'can do' guy.	Ye ggaayi 'asobola okukola'.
What is it now? 	Kati kiki?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
This is a very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
We were, too.	Naffe twali.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
But that’s basically the point.	Naye eyo okusinga y’ensonga.
This is not easy.	Kino si kyangu.
He does this all the time.	Kino akikola buli kiseera.
And they were.	Era baali.
It was a very difficult problem.	Kyali kizibu kizibu nnyo.
I don’t think I have yet.	Sirowooza nti n’okutuusa kati.
But here he comes to you.	Naye wano ajja gy’oli.
It's not that important to his job though.	Si kikulu nnyo ku mulimu gwe wadde.
I want to be better tomorrow.	Njagala kubeera bulungi enkya.
He wasn’t going to be able to do this.	Kino yali tagenda kusobola kukikola.
However, it is very powerful.	Kyokka, kya maanyi nnyo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
However, probably not.	Kyokka, oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
And there was nothing.	Era nga tewali kintu kyonna.
But, one should be who one really is.	Naye, omuntu yandibadde ky’ali ddala.
And really, isn't that the point?.	Era ddala, eyo si y'ensonga?.
Not with me.	Si nange.
And it’s not true that no one saw.	Era si kituufu nti tewali yalaba.
I think he wanted to.	Ndowooza yali ayagala.
I think he was.	Ndowooza bwe yali.
And, of course,…	Era, ddala,...
Now, that was lucky.	Kati, ekyo kyali kya mukisa.
It won’t last long now.	Tekijja kumala bbanga ddene kati.
A book, perhaps.	Ekitabo, mpozzi.
That was realistic.	Ekyo kyali kya ddala.
But it wasn’t like that.	Naye nga si bwe yali.
I really wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or not.	Mazima ddala nnali sikakasa oba ekyo kyali kintu kirungi oba nedda.
At the time, he said, everything was fine.	Mu kiseera ekyo yagamba nti buli kimu kyali kirungi.
I love you so much.	Njagala nnyo ggwe.
He was completely alone.	Yali yekka ddala.
That was really important.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo ddala.
I want to talk to him.	Njagala okwogera naye.
Everyone knew it.	Buli omu yali akimanyi.
He didn’t like me or him.	Yali tayagala nze oba ye.
I have one of them.	Nze nnina emu.
It is easy to get this book.	Kyangu okufuna ekitabo kino.
He doesn’t want to go.	Tayagala kugenda.
And that’s what it is.	Era ekyo kye kiri.
. . . .	.
He should have gone.	Yandibadde agenda.
I don’t want to talk about anything.	Saagala kwogera ku kintu kyonna.
Lots of things like that.	Ebintu bingi nga ebyo.
You’re good without it.	Oli mulungi nga tolina.
I was a human being.	Nze nali muntu.
I need to know that you can do that.	Nnina okumanya nti ekyo osobola okukikola.
I was, too.	Nange nnali.
I know this.	Kino nkimanyi.
Maybe he wants to talk.	Mpozzi ayagala kwogera.
Glad you like it.	Musanyufu nti oyagala.
But it certainly won’t be a problem.	Naye mazima ddala tekijja kuba kizibu.
Or he does that.	Oba akola bw’atyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
In his own way.	Mu ngeri ye.
Not that at all.	Si ekyo n’akatono.
He didn’t want to preach.	Yali tayagala kubuulira.
It is difficult, however, to truly answer this.	Kyokka, kizibu mu butuufu okuddamu kino.
Of course, this is not realistic.	Kya lwatu nti kino si kya ddala.
And it’s very difficult.	Era kizibu nnyo.
You always know where it is.	Bulijjo omanyi gye kiri.
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
And he kind of did.	Era ye mu ngeri yakola.
In fact, it was awful.	Mu butuufu, kyali kibi nnyo.
Don’t know why exactly.	Tomanyi lwaki ddala.
You must be my brother.	Ggwe olina okuba muganda wange.
I will do that this weekend.	Ekyo nja kukikola wiikendi eno.
One does not need to know anything.	Omuntu talina kye yeetaaga kumanya.
Or he loves money.	Oba ayagala nnyo ssente.
That was a really good thing.	Ekyo kyali kintu kirungi ddala.
He'll have to get out of here.	Ajja kuba alina okuva wano.
But now there is no time.	Naye kati tewali budde.
But no, definitely not that.	Naye nedda, mazima ddala si ekyo.
No one went to see.	Tewali yagenda kulaba.
He thought this was a good thing.	Yalowooza nti kino kyali kintu kirungi.
I want to know what it is.	Njagala kumanya kiki.
You are my best friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange asinga.
Will the bus come often?	Bbaasi ejja kujja nnyo?
Driving to the office.	Okuvuga mmotoka okugenda mu ofiisi.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
And indeed it was.	Era ddala bwe kyali.
But that was last week.	Naye eyo yali wiiki ewedde.
He was a man	Yali muntu .
It may be true.	Kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
I don’t have an answer for that.	Ekyo sirina kya kuddamu.
I don’t want anyone to see this.	Saagala muntu yenna kulaba kino.
The problem is his job.	Obuzibu bwe mulimu gwe.
I know that’s important to you.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo kikulu gy’oli.
I thought you were there for me.	Nalowooza nti oli gyendi.
And now, here we were.	Era kati, wano we twali.
They are not, obviously.	Si bwe bali, kya lwatu.
Tomorrow was coming.	Enkya yali ejja.
The food is here.	Emmere eri wano.
It’s a very good thing.	Kintu kirungi nnyo.
I’m not the only one who can do that.	Si nze nzekka asobola okukola ekyo.
I am a teacher.	Nze ndi musomesa.
You can read about the concept here.	Osobola okusoma ku ndowooza eno wano.
That had to be the case.	Ekyo kyalina okuba nga bwe kiri.
Good to talk to you.	Kirungi okwogera naawe.
He would be helpless.	Yandibadde talina buyambi bwonna.
And it was great, too.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo, era.
And there is.	Era waliwo.
Can you see it?	Osobola okulaba?
Very good indeed.	Kirungi nnyo ddala.
He wanted them both.	Yali ayagala bombi.
This is very common.	Kino kya bulijjo nnyo.
Nothing to do now.	Tewali kya kukola kati.
Or, maybe, always.	Oba, mpozzi, bulijjo.
Not before, and not now.	Si emabegako, era si kati.
Unusual.	Si kya bulijjo.
He spoke very well.	Yayogera bulungi nnyo.
But, honestly, it’s not good.	Naye, mu butuufu, si kirungi.
It will be enough.	Kijja kumala.
You have to know things like that.	Olina okumanya ebintu nga ebyo.
This is not something to try at home.	Kino si kintu kya kugezaako awaka.
I can easily do this job.	Omulimu guno nsobola bulungi okukola.
As he should have been.	Nga bwe yandibadde.
But he knew so much more.	Naye yali amanyi bingi nnyo.
It won’t be the same!	Tekijja kuba kye kimu!
I love my job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwange.
That’s as simple as that.	Ekyo kyangu nga ekyo.
That was a little awkward.	Ekyo kyali kizibu katono.
You know how to do it now.	Omanyi okukikola kati.
That’s a good idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kirungi.
Everything is important.	Buli kintu kyonna kikulu.
The singer is a singer.	Muyimbi muyimbi.
Me, well.	Nze, bulungi.
I needed to get out of the house.	Nnali nneetaaga okuva mu nnyumba.
Not even the dog.	Si wadde embwa.
I don’t really know what’s going on.	Simanyi bulungi kigenda mu maaso.
No one saw anything.	Tewali yalaba kintu kyonna.
One in the morning, one in the evening.	Omu ku makya, omu akawungeezi.
He couldn't say how many hours.	Yali tasobola kwogera ssaawa mmeka.
And it was much worse than that.	Era kyali kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He will do very well.	Ajja kukola bulungi nnyo.
The house is the house that is.	Ennyumba ye nnyumba eri.
It was very accurate.	Kyali kituufu nnyo.
Nothing and everything.	Tewali kintu kyonna na buli kimu.
That was what he was thinking.	Ekyo kye yali alowooza.
It’s not too bad.	Si kibi nnyo.
You were there, and you were there.	Ggwe wali awo, era naawe wali.
It’s going on.	Kigenda mu maaso.
Very good, he said.	Kirungi nnyo, bwe yagambye.
Every man does his job.	Buli musajja akola omulimu gwe.
But it would be nice to go.	Naye kyandibadde kirungi okugenda.
Call the police.	Kuba poliisi essimu.
As it was in yesterday.	Nga bwe kyali mu jjo.
And it could be happening now.	Era kiyinza okuba nga kigenda mu maaso kati.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
Very good indeed.	Kirungi nnyo ddala.
But he works hard.	Naye akola nnyo.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
I didn’t know it.	Nze nali simanyi.
He is my friend	Ye mukwano gwange .
Are you sure you would like to do that?	Okakasa nti ekyo wandyagadde okukikola?
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
Whatever he was hoping for, that wasn’t it.	Kyonna kye yali asuubira, ekyo si kye kyali.
I'm glad he's going to be there with me.	Ndi musanyufu nti agenda kubeerawo nange.
But not like you.	Naye si nga ggwe.
However, that is not the point here.	Kyokka, eyo si y’ensonga wano.
I think it’s going to be a great thing.	Ndowooza kigenda kuba kintu kirungi nnyo.
What do you want to see happen.	Kiki kyoyagala okulaba nga kigenda mu maaso.
I want to do that too.	Ekyo nange njagala kukikola.
Or so he said.	Oba bw’atyo bwe yagamba.
I have to know everything.	Nnina okumanya buli kimu.
I am a poet.	Ndi muyimbi.
But now, you will be you.	Naye kati, ojja kuba ggwe.
Something he felt was important.	Ekintu kye yawulira nga kikulu.
Maybe someone else will try.	Mpozzi omuntu omulala ajja kugezaako.
That’s probably true.	Ekyo osanga kituufu.
Not much, really.	Si bingi, ddala.
Very good actually.	Kirungi nnyo mu butuufu.
I have a lot of these.	Nnina bingi ku bino.
A little while.	Akaseera katono.
It would probably be true.	Oboolyawo kyandibadde kituufu.
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
Are you with us?.	Oli naffe?.
I am involved with you.	Nze ndi mu nsonga naawe.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
How we should be.	Engeri gye tusaanidde okubeera.
They were very lucky.	Baali ba mukisa nnyo.
We are very close friends.	Tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
Whether it’s visible or not.	Oba kirabika oba nedda.
It’s really quite simple.	Ddala kyangu nnyo.
You know it now.	Okimanyi kati.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange asinga.
I thought that was pretty cool.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
You seem harmless.	Olabika nga tolina bulabe.
Not at the moment, certainly.	Si mu kiseera kino, mazima ddala.
Neither here nor there.	Si wano wadde awo.
Whether or not.	Oba oba nedda.
Myself, and strong.	Nze kennyini, era nga ndi wa maanyi.
There is no great urgency.	Tewali bwangu bwa maanyi.
It was a great experience and everyone was happy.	Yali nsonga nnungi nnyo era buli omu yali musanyufu.
I don’t think anyone did.	Sirowooza nti tewali yakikola.
The plan is complete.	Enteekateeka ewedde.
You can’t just do this kind of thing.	Tosobola kukola kintu kya ngeri eno kyokka.
Why are you here?	Lwaki oli wano?
I am well and happy.	Ndi bulungi era ndi musanyufu.
You work hard.	Okola nnyo.
I know that and you know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi era ekyo naawe okimanyi.
This is a lot of money.	Guno ssente nnyingi nnyo.
He could hardly speak.	Yali tasobola bulungi kwogera.
What or where it is, he cannot say.	Kiki oba gye kiri, tasobola kwogera.
There is no one.	Tewali muntu yenna.
But that is not the case at all.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
But you should have gone.	Naye ggwe wandibadde ogenda.
I could do all of that.	Ebyo byonna nnali nsobola okukola.
She looked happy and beautiful.	Yalabika nga musanyufu era nga mulungi nnyo.
Not very happy but nothing is happening.	Si musanyufu nnyo naye tewali kigenda mu maaso.
One was expecting.	Omu yali asuubira.
I love being with him.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye.
Maybe it wasn’t him.	Mpozzi nga si ye.
I’m just sick.	Nze ndi mulwadde kyokka.
In that way.	Mu ngeri eyo.
The dog was fast asleep.	Embwa yali yeebase nnyo.
But it was the case.	Naye bwe kyali.
And, of course, not him.	Era, kya lwatu, si ye.
As we shall now do.	Nga bwe tujja okukola kati.
This was an all-or-nothing approach.	Eno yali nkola ya byonna oba nga tewali.
But he is strong.	Naye wa maanyi.
That you won’t do it.	Nti tojja kukikola.
He was there.	Yali awo.
It is mainly money.	Okusinga ze ssente.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
I can’t not work.	Sisobola obutakola.
Late in the evening you come to them.	Akawungeezi ennyo ojja gye bali.
We can all do it.	Ffenna tusobola.
All of that.	Ebyo byonna.
He will be here.	Ajja kuba wano.
But you can do it.	Naye oyinza okukikola.
He would be fine right?.	Yandibadde bulungi nedda?.
I think this is a good idea.	Ndowooza kino kirowoozo kirungi.
It just doesn’t seem right.	Kirabika kyokka nga si kituufu.
So far, so good.	N’okutuusa kati, kirungi nnyo.
It’s the same as me.	Kye kimu nga nze.
Now everyone is working.	Kati buli muntu akola.
I know it, too.	Nange nkimanyi.
He was everything to me.	Yali buli kimu gyendi.
This is true of every single person.	Kino kituufu ku buli muntu omu.
His brother has too.	Muganda we naye alina.
It won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo.
My brother and his wife are there now.	Muganda wange ne mukyala we bali awo kati.
He is a good friend of mine.	Ye mukwano gwange omulungi.
Not true right now.	Si kituufu mu kiseera kino.
You want to talk to him.	Oyagala okwogera naye.
It’s not a good idea.	Si kirowoozo kirungi.
This was very easy.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo.
That's all.	Ekyo kyokka.
I really didn’t want to know.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kumanya.
You won’t win.	Tojja kuwangula.
The money he needs.	Ssente ze yeetaaga.
Whether it’s a wedding or not.	Oba mbaga oba nedda.
I have absolutely no interest in that.	Ekyo sirina n’akatono kye njagala.
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
Not so much here, though.	Si nnyo wano, naye.
And it isn’t.	Era si bwe kiri.
This book is a great read.	Ekitabo kino kikulu nnyo okusoma.
But you have to know.	Naye olina okumanya.
And we should too.	Era naffe tusaanidde.
I’m not alone.	Si nzekka.
This week tonight you must come back to me.	Wiiki eno ekiro olina okudda gye ndi.
Everyone is moving forward.	Buli omu agenda mu maaso.
Or so she always thought.	Oba ekyo kye yali alowooza bulijjo.
My brother is in town.	Muganda wange ali mu kibuga.
And in many cases they were.	Era mu mbeera nnyingi bwe baali.
I'm just wondering.	Nze nneebuuza kyokka.
Would be happy to help.	Kyandibadde musanyufu okuyamba.
We were both.	Ffembi twali...
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
He looked beautiful.	Yalabika nga mulungi.
But it’s still not the same.	Naye n’okutuusa kati si kye kimu.
You want to get faster or whatever.	Oyagala kufuna mangu oba kyonna.
He loved his job.	Yali ayagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
Soon we will be there!	Mu bbanga ttono tujja kubeerawo!
It was almost now.	Yali kumpi kati.
He got lucky.	Yafuna omukisa.
Probably too many.	Oboolyawo bingi nnyo.
Not just for me, but for anyone.	Si nze nzekka, naye eri omuntu yenna.
And he knows why.	Era amanyi ensonga lwaki.
He didn’t have to do it.	Yali talina kukikola.
He didn’t know he could talk to her like that.	Yali tamanyi nti asobola okwogera naye bw’atyo.
He certainly knew it.	Mazima ddala yali akimanyi.
Certainly not for the office.	Mazima ddala si lwa ofiisi.
He was like that.	Yali bw’atyo.
I want to work with you.	Njagala kukola naawe.
That was pretty easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo.
I don’t have time to say much much more.	Sirina budde kwogera bingi bingi.
Everyone expects to do it.	Buli omu asuubira okukikola.
Very little.	Katono nnyo.
It’s not this thing or that thing.	Si kintu kino oba ekintu ekyo.
We were best friends this morning.	Twali ba mukwano nnyo enkya ya leero.
However, it was.	Kyokka, bwe kyali.
It’s my car.	Ye mmotoka yange.
We can.	Tusobola.
Tom is sick.	Tom mulwadde.
No one knew where.	Tewali yali amanyi wa.
Will be back soon.	Ajja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
Why is he so unhappy?	Lwaki si musanyufu nnyo?
You can’t stay here!	Tosobola kusigala wano!
I am not his patient at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo siri mulwadde we.
It won’t be fast.	Tekijja kuba kya mangu.
Both of them.	Bombi bombi.
It’s not us.	Si ffe.
This was the house.	Eno ye yali ennyumba.
He doesn’t know.	Tamanyi.
They are in a hurry.	Bali mu bwangu.
I need the money.	Nze nneetaaga ssente.
I can’t stay.	Sisobola kusigala.
That’s a lot of money.	Oyo ssente nnyingi nnyo.
Anything.	Ekintu kyonna.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
But what do you think?.	Naye ggwe olowooza ki?.
It’s a very good point.	Ensonga nnungi nnyo.
One thing is for sure.	Ekintu kimu nti.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kintu kirungi nnyo.
You are a good man.	Oli musajja mulungi.
I needed to get home.	Nnali nneetaaga okutuuka awaka.
There is no answer.	Tewali kuddamu.
This is, of course, not true.	Kino, kya lwatu, si kituufu.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
He did nothing regularly.	Tewali kye yakola bulijjo.
Sorry.	Nsonyiwa.
We have this.	Kino tulina.
But he won’t be here long.	Naye tajja kubeera wano bbanga ddene.
I will never do it again.	Sijja kuddamu kukikola.
I’m not feeling well.	Nze siri bulungi.
You are indeed very dangerous.	Mazima ddala oli wa bulabe nnyo.
He really could.	Ddala yali asobola.
Not to myself, not to anyone else.	Si eri nze kennyini, si eri omuntu omulala yenna.
We can’t wait for that to happen.	Ekyo tetusobola kulinda kubaawo.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
He will never be a problem again.	Tajja kuddamu kubeera buzibu.
I think this might help.	Ndowooza kino kiyinza okuyamba.
She was so young and so beautiful.	Yali muto nnyo era nga mulungi nnyo.
I immediately am not.	Nze amangu ddala si bwe kiri.
I couldn’t do much with him.	Nnali sisobola kukola nnyo naye.
But that was one thing.	Naye ekyo kyali kimu.
That was what that was.	Ekyo kye kyali ekyo.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
But that was the point.	Naye eyo ye yali ensonga.
It’s really pretty cool.	Ddala kirungi nnyo.
He was strong.	Yali wa maanyi.
Where did he go? 	Yagenda wa?
It’s not like that though.	Si bwe kiri wadde.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
I am not sure why this is happening.	Sikakasa lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso.
You don’t have to do it.	Tolina kukikola.
And I'm sorry.	Era nsonyiwa.
We have something to do.	Tulina kye tulina okukola.
I'm afraid.	Nze ntya.
And why not.	Era lwaki nedda.
Is this your car?	Eno mmotoka yo?
You won’t have him.	Tojja kuba na ye.
She doesn’t just want a man.	Tayagala musajja yekka.
Are you.	Ye ggwe.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
He would have been there.	Yandibadde awo.
He comes here at this time.	Ajja wano mu kiseera kino.
That was easier said than done, of course.	Ekyo kyali kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola, ddala.
I don’t think you even want help.	Sirowooza nti oyagala wadde obuyambi.
I was too good for any one man.	Nali mulungi nnyo ku musajja yenna omu.
No one knows.	Tewali amanyi.
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
And you are the one.	Era ggwe oli.
You are the best man.	Oli musajja asinga.
But for all that, no.	Naye ku byonna, nedda.
I definitely want to play.	Mazima ddala njagala kuzannya.
He is much better than one.	Asinga nnyo omu ku omu.
He wanted that very much.	Ekyo yali ayagala nnyo.
Where and how do we have it, now when do we need it.	Tulina wa ne engeri, kati twetaaga ddi.
How are you.	Oli otya.
No one can really say.	Tewali asobola ddala kwogera.
He is now in office.	Kati ali mu ofiisi.
I want to do so many things.	Njagala okukola ebintu bingi nnyo.
The reason why you are there.	Ensonga lwaki oli awo.
But it’s so easy.	Naye nga kyangu nnyo.
But this won’t work.	Naye kino tekijja kukola.
I want to know too.	Nange njagala kumanya.
And you were alone.	Era wali wekka.
I needed this today.	Kino nnali nneetaaga leero.
He didn’t seem to have any girlfriends.	Yalabika nga talina muganzi yenna.
Someone else too.	Omuntu omulala naye.
This is really quite simple.	Kino ddala kyangu nnyo.
It is, and it is not.	Kiri, era si bwe kiri.
It will come, he thought, it will come.	Kijja kujja, yalowooza, kijja kujja.
He shouldn’t say that.	Ekyo tasaanidde kwogera.
That’s a good thing to say.	Ekyo kintu kirungi okwogera.
Now, it’s not a problem.	Kati, si kizibu.
He and I.	Ye nange.
He really shouldn’t be here, doing this.	Mazima ddala tasaanidde kubeera wano, ng’akola kino.
This afternoon, probably.	Akawungeezi ka leero, osanga.
That’s not a bad thing to go.	Ekyo si kibi okugenda.
It seems simple but it isn’t.	Kirabika kyangu naye si bwe kiri.
It was so close.	Kyali kumpi nnyo.
I certainly do, it was good to see.	Mazima ddala nkola, kyali kirungi okulaba.
You have been good to me.	Obadde mulungi gyendi.
That guy got really lucky, though.	Ggaayi oyo yafuna omukisa ddala, wadde.
Like, one exactly.	Nga, omu ddala.
Maybe it could work.	Mpozzi kiyinza okukola.
But mostly he was a good kid.	Naye okusinga yali mwana mulungi.
All at the same time.	Byonna mu kiseera kye kimu.
You have a plan.	Olina enteekateeka.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
No one knows where you are.	Tewali amanyi gyoli.
Now he wants to make a movie.	Kati ayagala kukola firimu.
I knew it would be coming.	Namanya nti kijja kuba kijja.
I was there for the guy.	Nze nnali awo.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
As he had been.	Nga bwe yali abadde.
He wasn’t pretty, either.	Naye yali si mulungi, naye.
I don’t like it.	Sikyagala.
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
Whatever it is .	Kyonna kye kiri .
I hope I’m not either.	Nsuubira nti nange si bwe kiri.
However, this is not good.	Kyokka, kino si kirungi.
Let me think about it.	Ka ndowooza.
Thinking about something is good.	Okulowooza ku kintu kirungi.
I just wonder why that is.	Nze nneebuuza kyokka ensonga lwaki ekyo.
He has his own plan.	Alina enteekateeka ye.
He can be anything.	Asobola okuba ekintu kyonna.
I love it as much as I do.	Njagala nnyo nga nze.
That is very, very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo nnyo.
This was always his problem.	Kino bulijjo kye kyali ekizibu kye.
And he could.	Era yali asobola.
That was one thing.	Ekyo kyali kintu kimu.
We cannot accept this fact.	Ensonga eno tetusobola kukkiriza.
I don’t really want to talk to him.	Saagala nnyo kwogera naye.
Nothing, really.	Tewali kintu kyonna, ddala.
And yet, it’s happening anyway.	Era naye, kigenda mu maaso mu ngeri yonna.
I don’t care who it was or who did it.	Sifaayo ani yali oba ani yakikola.
He knew she looked good.	Yali akimanyi nti alabika bulungi.
He didn’t want to drive.	Yali tayagala kuvuga mmotoka.
I don’t think it will happen.	Sirowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
We are here.	Tuli wano.
But there was nothing there.	Naye nga tewali kintu kyonna awo.
That’s not true.	Oyo si kituufu.
I’ve always wanted to go.	Bulijjo njagala nnyo okugenda.
This was realistic.	Kino kyali kya ddala.
I expected so much more.	Nali nsuubira bingi nnyo.
But it’s a good one.	Naye nga kirungi.
He wanted to be an artist.	Yali ayagala kubeera muyimbi.
And it’s not just this.	Era si kino kyokka.
Everything happens so fast.	Buli kimu kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
I had no idea what my father was planning.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki taata kye yali ateekateeka.
Whatever you want.	Kyonna ky’oyagala.
It doesn’t matter what.	Si kikulu ki.
I wanted to, you know that.	Nnali njagala, ekyo okimanyi.
There is no plan for any system.	Tewali nteekateeka yonna ku nkola yonna.
He was almost out of sight now.	Yali kumpi okuva mu maaso kati.
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
Everyone here works.	Buli muntu wano akola.
This thing here, that thing there.	Ekintu kino wano, ekintu ekyo awo.
It’s important to do well.	Kikulu okukola obulungi.
I was mostly happy.	Nze okusinga nnali musanyufu.
I wonder what will happen?.	Nze nneebuuza kiki ekigenda okubaawo?.
He was with her still.	Yali naye nga akyali.
It was a party.	Yali kabaga.
Now we are here.	Kati tuli wano.
You’re going home.	Ggwe ogenda eka.
I don’t have any money now.	Kati sirina ssente yonna.
I am planning to.	Nteekateeka okukola...
I know nothing about it.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
What about you?.	Ggwe kiki?.
I have also been thinking.	Nze era mbadde ndowooza.
It won’t be a problem.	Tekijja kuba kizibu.
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
I had no idea about this.	Kino nnali sirina kye mmanyi.
We’ll talk in the morning.	Tujja kwogera ku makya.
He expected to see someone who knew here.	Yali asuubira okulaba omuntu amanyi wano.
He couldn’t tell.	Yali tasobola kumanya.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
And it’s real.	Era kya ddala.
You really are a good friend.	Ddala oli mukwano mulungi.
We in this room.	Ffe mu kisenge kino.
We have to go together, tonight.	Tulina okugenda ffenna, ekiro kino.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
It would be hard to say.	Kyandibadde kizibu okwogera.
It’s not necessarily bad.	Si kituufu nti kibi.
I don't know what.	Simanyi ki.
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
That’s not the point.	Eyo si y’ensonga.
It belonged to my brother.	Yali ya muganda wange.
He says that.	Agamba nti.
I know this is a bad time.	Nkimanyi nti kino kiseera kibi.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
But it was probably true.	Naye osanga kyali kituufu.
There are so many houses.	Ennyumba nnyingi nnyo.
There is no such thing you will not do.	Tewali kintu ng’ekyo tojja kukola.
For many reasons.	Ku nsonga nnyingi.
He was glad he had.	Yali musanyufu nti yalina.
You are in time.	Oli mu budde.
It won’t come.	Tekijja kujja.
However, it is very difficult.	Kyokka, kizibu nnyo.
You can get help much faster than in the past.	Osobola okufuna obuyambi amangu nnyo okusinga bwe kyali emabega.
I am not a threat to anyone.	Siri wa bulabe eri omuntu yenna.
Actually.	Mazima.
Indeed, it is central to my case.	Mazima ddala, kye kikulu mu nsonga yange.
The food, such as it was, was ready.	Emmere, nga bwe yali, yali ewedde.
One of us, now.	Omu ku ffe, kati.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I can say that much.	Nsobola okwogera bingi ebyo.
Definitely not a good idea.	Mazima ddala si kirowoozo kirungi.
This is a powerful thing.	Kino kintu kya maanyi.
You don’t know how.	Tomanyi ngeri ki.
Good, he said.	Kirungi, bwe yagambye.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
It could happen tomorrow.	Kiyinza okubaawo enkya.
He was terrified.	Yali atya nnyo.
No one spoke to him.	Tewali yayogera naye.
I feel really good.	Mpulira bulungi ddala.
There is.	Waliwo.
It’s hard to live in this city.	Kizibu okubeera mu kibuga kino.
He is beautiful.	Ye mulungi.
You are going to do this right now.	Kino ogenda kukikola mu kiseera kino.
But no one will do it.	Naye tewali ajja kukikola.
Although it is difficult.	Wadde nga kizibu.
Apparently there is.	Kirabika waliwo.
I am currently very happy.	Mu kiseera kino ndi musanyufu nnyo.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
It was a powerful thing.	Kyali kintu kya maanyi.
But it’s a little complicated.	Naye nga kizibu katono.
But you can’t come with us.	Naye tosobola kujja naffe.
Good job.	Omulimu omulungi.
It’s easy from here.	Kyangu okuva wano.
In this sense, it’s not.	Mu ngeri eno, si ekyo.
Everyone knows that.	Ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
Or whatever that was.	Oba kyonna ekyo kye kyali.
I was convinced.	Nali nkakasa.
I’m here to see my dad.	Nze ndi wano okulaba taata wange.
All of it all, really.	Byonna byonna, ddala.
He didn’t know what he was doing.	Yali tamanyi kye yali akola.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
I was ready to.	Nnali mwetegefu okukola...
Maybe this didn’t need to be here.	Mpozzi kino yali teyeetaaga kubeera wano.
And from myself.	Era okuva eri nze kennyini.
He was in the here and now.	Yali mu wano ne kati.
It’s not necessarily good.	Si kituufu nti kirungi.
My girlfriend is beautiful.	Muganzi wange mulungi.
He must have been asleep for a long time.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali amaze ebbanga ddene nga yeebase.
I am a very good person.	Ndi muntu mulungi nnyo.
That is very powerful.	Ekyo kya maanyi nnyo.
That will be good.	Ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
You don’t want to do this.	Kino toyagala kukikola.
But that’s not mine.	Naye ekyo si kyange.
And mostly you.	Era okusinga ggwe.
Or perhaps you.	Oba oboolyawo ggwe.
He had to get out of here.	Yalina okuva wano.
It’s good when there isn’t.	Kirungi nga tewali.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
All right, we'll try it your way.	Kirungi, tujja kugezaako mu ngeri yo.
I know it’s hard, but it’s what we have to do.	Nkimanyi nti kizibu naye kye tulina okukola.
Not both of us.	Si ffembi.
We’re going to try.	Tugenda kugezaako.
It was a wonderful time.	Kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo.
He is working on this.	Akola ku nsonga eno.
However, it is not a finished process.	Kyokka si nkola ewedde.
But that everything is nothing.	Naye nti buli kimu si kintu.
But he had a point.	Naye yalina ensonga.
There is a reason why.	Waliwo ensonga lwaki.
He was going to have to go.	Yali agenda kuba alina okugenda.
And he is still with me.	Era akyali nange.
He did, you know.	Yakikola, omanyi.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
He has to do it.	Alina okukikola.
Nothing to see here.	Tewali kya kulaba wano.
Granted, this would be true.	Kituufu nti kino kyandibadde kituufu.
It is very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukikola.
And that won’t be easy.	Era ekyo tekijja kuba kyangu.
He often works on weekends.	Atera okukola ku wiikendi.
We don’t have to wait for anyone.	Tetulina kulinda muntu yenna.
No one said much.	Tewali yayogera bingi.
He loves it so much.	Ayagala nnyo.
He is a good man.	Ye musajja mulungi.
And you know it, too.	Era naawe okimanyi.
He is nothing to me.	Ye si kintu gyendi.
And that’s the doctor.	Era oyo ye musawo.
He will be ready to go.	Ajja kuba mwetegefu okugenda.
Nothing.	Tewali.
I’m sorry to say that, but it’s true.	Nsonyiwa okwogera ekyo naye kituufu.
You won’t stay.	Tojja kusigala.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
He couldn't answer.	Yali tasobola kuddamu.
We were going to do it anyway.	Twali tugenda kukikola mu ngeri yonna.
You have it, too.	Naawe olina.
I think he has.	Ndowooza alina.
As it may be.	Nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
It won’t be any good for you.	Tekijja kuba kirungi kyonna gyoli.
He is in good shape.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi.
But that’s a good idea.	Naye ekyo kirowoozo kirungi.
I didn’t want to go.	Nnali saagala kugenda.
You have to go to school every day.	Olina okugenda ku ssomero buli lunaku.
But he didn’t want anything.	Naye yali talina ky’ayagala.
I'll just make one.	Nja kumala kukola emu.
Good for both of them.	Kirungi gye bali bombi.
Which is going on a lot.	Ekigenda mu maaso nnyo.
Maybe more than yourself.	Mpozzi okusinga ggwe kennyini.
It is what it is today.	Kye kiri leero.
He needed strength.	Yali yeetaaga amaanyi.
It was easy.	Kyali kyangu.
I just don’t go.	Nze sigenda kyokka.
She looks good to me too.	Nange alabika bulungi gyendi.
However, it is not true.	Kyokka, si kituufu.
No work of any kind.	Tewali mulimu gwa ngeri yonna.
We need all the help we can get.	Twetaaga obuyambi bwonna bwe tusobola okufuna.
He was facing a problem.	Yali ayolekedde ekizibu.
Not a child of a child.	Si mwana wa mwana.
You know where everything is.	Omanyi buli kimu we kiri.
I can’t wait to play.	Siyinza kulinda kuzannya.
I am well aware of that.	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi.
I am truly sorry.	Mazima ddala nsonyiwa.
I am a good friend of mine.	Ndi mukwano gwange mulungi.
Very good indeed it is.	Kirungi nnyo mazima ddala bwe kiri.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
It doesn’t matter to me.	Si kikulu gyendi.
Doing so is hard work.	Okukikola mulimu gwa maanyi.
I don’t know if we can win.	Simanyi oba tusobola okuwangula.
We are in the same class at school.	Tuli mu kibiina kye kimu ku ssomero.
Until today of course.	Okutuusa leero ddala.
Doing what you want.	Okukola ky’oyagala.
I can’t quite believe it.	Siyinza bulungi kukkiriza.
Weeks too early.	Wiiki nga bukyali nnyo.
Here we are right now.	Wano we tuli mu kiseera kino.
It’s very important to them.	Kikulu nnyo gye bali.
I'm sorry, everyone, she thought.	Nsonyiwa, buli omu, bwe yalowooza.
It’s important to me.	Kikulu gyendi.
That’s up to you.	Ekyo kiri gyoli.
Very good though.	Kirungi nnyo wadde.
He didn't know why.	Yali tamanyi lwaki.
Happy to be with you.	Musanyufu okuba naawe.
Pretty good, actually.	Kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
Although he might have been.	Wadde nga yandiba nga bwe yali.
He won’t do it obviously.	Tajja kukikola kya lwatu.
He was rather busy.	Yali asinga kuba bbize.
You have to get out of there.	Olina okuva awo.
I was like, really.	Nali nga, ddala.
I couldn’t find anything.	Nnali sisobola kufuna kintu kyonna.
He also made a lot of money.	Yakola ne ssente nnyingi.
I want, I want, I want.	Njagala, njagala, njagala.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
He did well with her.	Yakola bulungi naye.
Which he didn’t want to do, yet.	Kye yali tayagala kukola, nga tannaba.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
We are a man and a woman.	Ffe tuli musajja na mukyala.
Exactly.	Kye ekyo.
You.	Ggwe.
I’m not sure how much.	Sikakasa ssente mmeka.
Here we go.	Wano we tugenda.
It’s good to be nice.	Kirungi okuba omulungi.
But he wasn't thinking very clearly at the time.	Naye mu kiseera ekyo yali talowooza bulungi nnyo.
And it’s so bad.	Era kibi nnyo.
But no one really had.	Naye ddala tewali yali yalina.
Which will happen soon.	Ekigenda okubaawo mu bbanga ttono.
That's really my whole point.	Eyo ddala nsonga yange yonna.
I hope that’s not you.	Nsuubira nti oyo si ggwe.
No one is in sight.	Tewali muntu yenna alabika.
He had no real option.	Yali talina kya kukola kya ddala.
You seem to be in a hurry.	Olabika oli mu bwangu.
He had what he needed.	Yalina bye yali yeetaaga.
That’s very hard to do.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo okukola.
He's a great guy to work with.	Ggaayi mulungi nnyo okukola naye.
Not everyone would be.	Si buli muntu nti yandibadde.
You know it’s true.	Omanyi nti kituufu.
However, there is one problem.	Kyokka waliwo ekizibu kimu.
No one really does.	Tewali muntu yenna akola ddala.
It was an excellent move.	Yali nkola nnungi nnyo.
That’s the point.	Eyo y’ensonga.
That’s a real problem.	Ekyo kizibu kya ddala.
No one was talking.	Tewali yali ayogera.
No one is really happy living in the city.	Tewali musanyufu ddala kubeera mu kibuga.
He might have done this.	Kino yandiba nga yakikola.
No one should be here.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kubeera wano.
Perhaps he really was trying to help.	Oboolyawo ddala yali agezaako okuyamba.
The plan was complete.	Enteekateeka yali ewedde.
Only one down there.	Omu yekka wansi awo.
Reading is very important.	Okusoma kikulu nnyo.
He began having trouble thinking clearly.	Yatandika okufuna obuzibu okulowooza obulungi.
I was very ready.	Nnali mwetegefu nnyo.
I didn’t quite know what to do.	Nnali simanyi bulungi kya kukola.
For how long.	Okumala bbanga ki.
I didn’t think he would last a week.	Nnali sirowooza nti ajja kumala wiiki emu.
Nothing is going to happen.	Tewali kigenda kubaawo.
That’s not a bad thing for me.	Ekyo si kibi gyendi.
He may be the only one.	Ayinza okuba nga ye yekka.
It’s not a good thing.	Si kintu kirungi.
Not always someone so young though.	Si bulijjo muntu muto bwatyo wadde.
I couldn’t find an answer.	Nnali sisobola kufuna kya kuddamu.
And now here it is.	Era kati wano.
No one on the.	Tewali muntu yenna ku...
I don’t want to be here.	Saagala kubeera wano.
I'll try it tomorrow.	Nja kugezaako enkya.
But not himself.	Naye si ye kennyini.
You can do these things.	Osobola okukola ebintu bino.
Nobody wants that!.	Ekyo tewali ayagala!.
No one knew.	Tewali yali amanyi.
It was really beautiful.	Ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
That is obviously very important.	Ekyo kya lwatu nti kikulu nnyo.
His brother would do.	Muganda we yandikoze.
She is a very nice lady.	Mukyala mulungi nnyo.
I’m sure he knows who it is.	Nkakasa nti amanyi ani.
Like this?	Nga kino?
He already knows that.	Ekyo akimanyi dda.
Perhaps he knew it.	Oboolyawo yali akimanyi.
He really wanted to go.	Yali ayagala nnyo okugenda.
There is no waiting time, he said.	Tewali budde bwa kulinda, bwe yagambye.
In the morning as usual.	Ku makya nga bulijjo.
He wants to do things.	Ayagala okukola ebintu.
He knew what he was talking about.	Yali amanyi kye yali ayogera ku nsonga eyo.
And he couldn’t see anything.	Era nga tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
He spoke very quickly.	Yayogera mangu nnyo.
We both needed to do it.	Ffembi twali twetaaga okukikola.
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
You are not in any driving condition.	Toli mu mbeera yonna ya kuvuga.
That’s what’s here.	Ekyo kye kiri wano.
I don’t want this.	Kino saagala.
I can never be him.	Siyinza n’akatono kubeera ye.
I don’t know, not really.	Simanyi, si ddala.
I am happy to be home.	Ndi musanyufu okubeera awaka.
He knew he couldn’t win.	Yali akimanyi nti tasobola kuwangula.
But this is normal.	Naye kino kya bulijjo.
However, that is not all.	Kyokka, ekyo si kye kyokka.
No, not exactly.	Nedda, si bwe kiri ddala.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera.
For me, this is a good opportunity.	Nze guno mukisa mulungi.
He had been.	Yali abadde...
It would be difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
I was thinking now.	Nali ndowooza kati.
He didn’t know this was happening.	Kino yali tamanyi nti kigenda mu maaso.
He says he is busy.	Agamba nti ali bbize.
He is not that strong.	Si wa maanyi bw’atyo.
However, that’s not why.	Kyokka, si y’ensonga lwaki.
We have .	Tulina .
But you already know that.	Naye ekyo okimanyi dda.
And we can.	Era tusobola.
He did it for me.	Yakikola gyendi.
I couldn’t believe it and didn’t know what to say.	Nali siyinza kukkiriza era nga simanyi kya kwogera.
I am not sick.	Siri mulwadde.
A chance to come back.	Omukisa okudda.
Here we are in the office.	Wano tuli mu ofiisi.
I’m not sure that.	Sikakasa nti.
Not even here.	Si wadde wano.
Nothing goes here.	Wano tewali kigenda.
I thought we were.	Nnalowooza nti tuli.
No, not that one.	Nedda, si oyo.
The other guy can see that.	Ggaayi omulala asobola okulaba ekyo.
What was that important? 	Ekyo kyali kikulu ki?
Good, but it’s the same.	Kirungi, naye kye kimu.
We’re going to drive there.	Tugenda kuvuga eyo.
Everyone is fine.	Buli omu ali bulungi.
Almost everyone does it.	Kumpi buli muntu akikola.
This is what it is.	Kino kye kiri.
I wasn’t ready.	Nnali siri mwetegefu.
And now he was afraid.	Era kati yali atya.
He is doing well now.	Akola bulungi kati.
It’s not believing in something.	Si kukkiriza mu kintu.
This is not true for everyone but it is common.	Kino si bwe kiri ku buli muntu naye kya bulijjo.
It’s not for everything.	Si kya buli kimu.
But one won’t do it.	Naye omuntu tajja kukikola.
I’m afraid you can’t come back.	Ntya nti tosobola kudda.
And you already have one.	Era olina dda emu.
As they were.	Nga bwe baali.
We can do something.	Tusobola okukola ekintu.
I couldn’t let it happen again.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza kuddamu kubaawo.
It doesn’t matter.	Si nsonga.
But you’re really not here.	Naye ddala toli wano.
I am his best man.	Nze musajja we asinga.
Perhaps they are.	Oboolyawo bwe bali.
I guess no one can.	Ntebereza tewali asobola.
He wants to see a movie.	Ayagala kulaba firimu.
I know this to be true.	Kino nkimanyi nti kituufu.
More than anything, he didn’t want to answer.	Okusinga ekintu kyonna, yali tayagala kuddamu.
He felt very comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo.
No, not this room.	Nedda, si kisenge kino.
And it really doesn’t matter.	Era ddala si kikulu.
He shouldn’t have believed it.	Yali tasaanidde kukkiriza.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I'm glad he said so.	Ndi musanyufu nti bwe yagamba.
He loves it so much.	Ayagala nnyo.
He knows a lot of things.	Amanyi ebintu bingi.
Now it was my turn.	Kati kyali kiseera kyange.
I have an opinion.	Nnina endowooza.
He is not here.	Tali wano.
I need one.	Nze nneetaaga emu.
I know what it is like.	Nze mmanyi bwe kiri.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
But there is.	Naye waliwo.
He looked dangerous.	Yalabika nga wa bulabe.
I can’t do it alone.	Sisobola kukikola nzekka.
He still wasn’t home.	Yali n’okutuusa kati yali tali waka.
That is a common issue.	Eyo nsonga ya bulijjo.
He was the one.	Ye yali ye.
And you're on.	Era oli ku...
But not in this case.	Naye si bwe kiri mu mbeera eno.
I’m sure you know that.	Nkakasa nti ekyo okimanyi.
No problem, he said.	Tewali buzibu bwe yagambye.
He was in every single one.	Yali mu buli emu.
But he wasn’t going to say that.	Naye yali tagenda kwogera bw’atyo.
I hope he does though.	Nsuubira nti akikola wadde.
No, not realistic at all.	Nedda, si kya ddala n’akatono.
But it simply wasn’t.	Naye kyangu si bwe kyali.
It’s too bad for them.	Kibi nnyo gye bali.
That’s pretty easy.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
What do you think of this?.	Bino olowooza ki?.
He had been my best friend.	Yali abadde mukwano gwange asinga.
And there is a reason.	Era waliwo ensonga.
It really had it.	Ddala kyalina.
I guess he can do it.	Ntebereza nti asobola okukikola.
I’ve been busy.	Mbadde bbize.
Now might be the time.	Kati kiyinza okuba nga kye kiseera.
Good.	Kirungi.
It doesn’t matter what the thing is.	Si kikulu ekintu kye kiri.
Apparently it isn’t.	Kirabika si bwe kiri.
As it is, it is.	Nga bwe kiri nti.
That’s what I do.	Kye nkola.
I won’t be there.	Sijja kubeerawo.
And that was all it was.	Era ekyo kyokka kye kyali.
In fact they are.	Mu butuufu bwe bali.
I knew it would work.	Nnali nkimanyi nti yandikoze.
He was a guy.	Yali ggaayi.
He didn’t know how to deal with it.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ya kukola ku nsonga.
Very nice guy.	Omulungi ennyo.
I will not speak again.	Sijja kuddamu kwogera.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
Either way, someone will be with you this evening.	Mu ngeri yonna, omuntu ajja kuba naawe akawungeezi ka leero.
And he has a reason.	Era alina ensonga.
We will do this next week.	Kino tugenda kukikola wiiki ejja.
He thought she looked interested this afternoon.	Yalowooza nti alabika ayagala akawungeezi ka leero.
That he wants it doesn’t matter.	Nti ayagala si kikulu.
I didn’t feel anything.	Nnali sirina kye mpulira.
He was pretty good about it.	Yali mulungi nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
He was thinking clearly, and that was good.	Yali alowooza bulungi era ekyo kyali kirungi.
He has a good job.	Alina omulimu omulungi.
Not in any way, no way.	Si mu ngeri yonna, wadde mu ngeri yonna.
Everyone was making money.	Buli omu yali akola ssente.
I have to get out of here now.	Nnina okuva wano kati.
He's fine.	Ali bulungi.
Leaving the city at night was very dangerous.	Okuva mu kibuga ekiro kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
No one could do anything.	Tewali yali asobola kukola kintu kyonna.
You are everything to them.	Ggwe buli kimu gye bali.
Not that it mattered, really.	Si nti kyali kikulu, ddala.
That's the thing.	Ekyo kye kintu.
Even for you.	Ne ku ggwe.
But, in truth, he has little hope.	Naye, mu mazima, alina essuubi ttono.
This is all we can do.	Kino kyokka kye tusobola okukola.
And it’s bad for my job.	Era kibi ku mulimu gwange.
And he didn’t want to.	Era yali tayagala.
But it’s not, and it’s not.	Naye si bwe kiri, era si bwe kiri.
You have to work.	Olina okukola.
Everything is right.	Buli kimu kituufu.
I know what he wants.	Nze mmanyi ky’ayagala.
It doesn’t matter how.	Si kikulu ngeri ki.
What to do with it?	Okukola ki?
And he was her.	Era ye yali ye.
We can’t stay here.	Tetusobola kusigala wano.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
It’s hard to say.	Kizibu okwogera.
Can anyone help please?.	Waliwo asobola okuyamba nsaba?.
He didn’t know anything.	Yali tamanyi kintu kyonna.
And now.	Era kati.
In this way, he said.	Mu ngeri eno, bwe yagambye.
Something was going down below.	Ekintu kyali kigenda wansi wansi.
And yes, we need money too.	Era ye, naffe twetaaga ssente.
We will certainly see.	Mazima ddala tujja kulaba.
I don’t go to school.	Sigenda ku ssomero.
It’s not my place.	Si kifo kyange.
I’m sick of it.	Nze ndi mulwadde.
And not at all .	Era n'akatono .
I’m glad you’re here today.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano leero.
One night, he went swimming alone.	Ekiro kimu, yagenda okuwuga yekka.
I have another chance.	Nnina omukisa omulala.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
Probably not a good idea.	Oboolyawo si kirowoozo kirungi.
And that would be him.	Era oyo yandibadde ye.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Naye si kibi.
I don't have time to do this right now.	Kino sirina budde kukola kino kati.
Or that’s what it seemed.	Oba ekyo kye kyali kirabika.
You may think you are an artist.	Oyinza okulowooza nti oli muyimbi.
I have no idea what they are.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki kye bali.
The house is in excellent condition.	Ennyumba eri mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
Everyone is working.	Buli omu akola.
He doesn’t want money.	Tayagala ssente.
It was a good feeling.	Yali mpulira nnungi.
But not really.	Naye si mu butuufu.
I don’t know what he saw in a guy like me.	Simanyi kye yalaba mu ggaayi nga nze.
No one knew much about it.	Tewali yali amanyi bingi ku nsonga eyo.
I’ve been around.	Nze mbadde.
And then there was nothing.	Era awo nga tewali.
That’s a pretty good thing then, kid.	Ekyo kintu kirungi nnyo awo mwana.
I’m not going to do it.	Sigenda kukikola.
You can talk to him.	Oyinza okwogera naye.
You can speak below.	Osobola okwogera wansi.
Where were we when.	Twali ludda wa ddi.
He was a young child.	Yali mwana muto.
He wanted to go home.	Yali ayagala kudda waka.
And there was nothing he could do about it.	Era nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eyo.
I belong to my time.	Nze ndi wa kiseera kyange.
I’ve always wanted to know that.	Ekyo bulijjo mbadde njagala okumanya.
You know that to be an issue.	Ekyo okimanyi okubeera ensonga.
Or you might be like.	Oba oyinza okuba nga.
I'm one of the.	Nze omu...
This is not true though.	Kino si kituufu wadde.
He’s going to be really good.	Agenda kuba mulungi ddala.
That you are where.	Nti ggwe oli wa.
I didn’t have it.	Nze nali sirina.
But you don’t know.	Naye ggwe tomanyi.
You have so much.	Olina bingi nnyo.
And he would .	Era yandibadde .
Actually, it was pretty good.	Mu butuufu, kyali kirungi nnyo.
I don’t care about time.	Sifaayo ku budde.
But he didn’t know.	Naye yali tamanyi.
The one he didn’t want to answer.	Eyo gye yali tayagala kuddamu.
I knew that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi.
I live in the city now.	Nze mbeera mu kibuga kati.
And he couldn’t see.	Era yali tasobola kulaba.
You were you.	Ggwe wali ggwe.
It's bad for you.	Kibi gyoli.
In that case, no.	Mu mbeera eyo, nedda.
What a difficult thing.	Nga kizibu nnyo.
He had no feeling.	Yali talina mpulira yonna.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
We can’t wait.	Tetusobola kulinda.
We were there.	Twali awo.
He knows.	Amanyi.
He said that.	Yagamba bw’atyo.
Down there,’ he said.	Wansi awo,’ bwe yagamba.
I am happy though.	Ndi musanyufu wadde.
But there was nothing there.	Naye nga tewali kintu kyonna awo.
He himself did not know why he did this.	Ye kennyini yali tamanyi lwaki yakola kino.
It was a good plan, he thought.	Yali nteekateeka nnungi, bwe yalowooza.
You want to come here.	Oyagala kujja wano.
They were really really friendly.	Baali ba mukwano ddala ddala.
I’m pretty sure it was you.	Nkakasa bulungi nti wali ggwe.
And it’s going on.	Era kigenda mu maaso.
I didn’t know it would do that.	Nali simanyi nti kijja kukola ekyo.
I had nothing to say.	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera.
But it’s not too bad.	Naye si kibi nnyo.
I don’t want anything.	Nze sirina kye njagala.
I don’t know why we’re here.	Simanyi lwaki tuli wano.
I didn’t know it.	Nze nali simanyi.
Today, there isn’t.	Leero, tewali.
That was all he needed.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali yeetaaga.
He thought maybe he needed one.	Yali alowooza nti osanga yeetaaga emu.
He really is better than my father.	Ddala asinga taata.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
I’m not sure what that is, exactly.	Sikakasa ekyo kye ki, ddala.
Little did he know this would be something he needed to do.	Yali tamanyi nti kino kyandibadde kintu kye yali yeetaaga okukola.
Yourself, of course.	Ggwe kennyini, ddala.
He is just one man.	Ye musajja omu yekka.
This is not quite true.	Kino si kituufu nnyo.
Actually not, of course.	Mu butuufu si bw’atyo, ddala.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
You in a relationship.	Ggwe mu mukwano.
He was very, very young.	Yali muto nnyo nnyo.
We can’t do anything.	Tetusobola kukola kintu kyonna.
I knew it well enough.	Nnali nkimanyi bulungi.
But it's the thing, maybe.	Naye kye kintu, mpozzi.
He should have gone to jail.	Yandibadde agenda mu kkomera.
What was that? 	Ekyo kyali ki?
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Who knew he had one.	Ani yali amanyi nti alina emu.
What do you think of this house?	Ggwe olowooza ki ku nnyumba eno?
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
He had to tell what he knew.	Yalina okubuulira bye yali amanyi.
No one expects this to happen.	Kino tewali asuubira kubaawo.
Someone like you.	Omuntu nga ggwe.
I hope it will be early.	Nsuubira nti kijja kuba nga bukyali.
He needed to go home.	Yali yeetaaga okudda eka.
He wasn’t real.	Yali si wa ddala.
He thought it was dangerous, certainly dangerous.	Yalowooza nti kya bulabe, mazima ddala kya bulabe.
Indeed, it is.	Ddala, bwe kiri.
And now he is doing it.	Era kati akikola.
But there was nothing.	Naye nga tewali kintu kyonna.
Here, to each ye.	Wano, eri buli omu ye.
I know he was.	Nkimanyi nti yali.
But there is no one.	Naye tewali muntu yenna.
I'm definitely going to do that again.	Mazima ddala ngenda kuddamu okukola ekyo.
I'm the one.	Nze ye.
I know you were doing the work.	Nkimanyi nti wali okola omulimu.
He just had to think.	Yalina okulowooza kyokka.
Seeing what we can see, like.	Okulaba bye tusobola okulaba, nga.
Exactly what is that.	Ddala ekyo kye ki.
He looked so young.	Yalabika nga muto nnyo.
That will continue.	Ekyo kijja kugenda mu maaso.
He obviously couldn’t.	Kya lwatu nti yali tasobola.
It was almost now, almost.	Yali kumpi kati, kumpi.
It is not the time to talk about it now.	Si kye kiseera okwogera ku nsonga eno kati.
We’re all about winning.	Ffenna tuli ku kuwangula.
You are the one.	Ggwe oli omu.
I really can’t know.	Mazima ddala sisobola kumanya.
But you know better.	Kyokka ggwe omanyi bulungi.
We cannot know.	Tetusobola kumanya.
This is great, isn’t it?	Kino kirungi nnyo, si bwe kiri?
Not bad.	Si kibi.
He lives alone.	Abeera yekka.
I am very happy now.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo kati.
He is in school.	Ali mu ssomero.
No one knows when.	Tewali amanyi ddi.
And you don’t have to either.	Era naawe tolina ku nsonga eyo.
It’s time to act.	Kye kiseera okukola.
I won’t wait any longer.	Sijja kuddamu kulinda.
It is truly a wonderful time.	Mazima ddala kiseera kirungi nnyo.
It was a good thing.	Kyali kintu kirungi.
What city is this?	Kino kibuga ki?
Now he knew what that thing was.	Kati yali amanyi ekintu ekyo kye kyali.
But not all of it.	Kyokka si byonna.
But he could talk.	Naye yali asobola okwogera.
He has his own book in progress.	Alina ekitabo kye ekigenda mu maaso.
And a good one at that.	Era omulungi ku ekyo.
He spoke, anyway.	Yayogera, mu ngeri yonna.
I didn’t really have an issue.	Mu butuufu nnali sirina nsonga.
How can I continue this.	Kino nnyinza ntya okugenda mu maaso.
There is just nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyokka.
He knew he wouldn’t last long.	Yali akimanyi nti tajja kumala bbanga ddene.
However, my brother has a point.	Kyokka muganda wange alina ensonga.
He said 'probably not'.	Yagambye nti 'oboolyawo si bwe kiri'.
That's what he is.	Kye ky'ali.
I’m afraid there’s only that one.	Ntya nti waliwo oyo yekka.
I know it’s dangerous.	Nkimanyi nti kya bulabe.
I could hardly believe it.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kukkiriza.
I love both of them.	Njagala nnyo bombi.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
Now, of course, he doesn’t want to be anything at the time.	Kati, ddala, tayagala kuba kintu kyonna mu kiseera ekyo.
You can see that.	Oyinza okulaba ekyo.
One per day.	Omu buli lunaku.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
In my room.	Mu kisenge kyange.
And you have to do that.	Era ekyo olina okukikola.
I'll talk to you soon.	Nja kwogera naawe mu bbanga ttono.
He might have been something.	Yandiba nga yali kintu.
He didn't know when he'd finished.	Yali tamanyi ddi lwe yali amaze.
He lives alone.	Abeera yekka.
You don’t know what’s going on.	Tomanyi kigenda mu maaso.
And we need another one.	Era twetaaga omulala.
Apparently.	Kirabika.
He's just there.	Ali awo yekka.
And that’s everything, you know.	Era ekyo buli kimu, omanyi.
However, of course.	Kyokka, mazima ddala.
He was a real person now.	Yali muntu ddala kati.
I knew how it was.	Nnali mmanyi engeri gye kiri.
We don’t have to talk.	Tetulina kwogera.
But it wasn’t his only favorite place.	Naye si kye kifo kyokka kye yali ayagala ennyo.
I don’t want to talk about him.	Saagala kwogera ku ye.
And here it is.	Era wano.
He almost had it.	Yali kumpi alina.
A beautiful home.	Awaka omulungi.
He couldn't, wouldn't, help his friend.	Yali tasobola, tayinza, kuyamba mukwano gwe.
And of course he knew where he was.	Era ddala yali amanyi gye yali.
He lives there and works.	Abeera eyo ng’akola.
My dog ​​is asleep.	Embwa yange yeebase.
That feels better than the movie right now.	Ekyo mpulira bulungi okusinga firimu mu kiseera kino.
I really didn’t want to go.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kugenda.
You are nobody.	Toli muntu yenna.
It is indeed a very dangerous job.	Mazima ddala mulimu gwa bulabe nnyo.
He wasn’t sick.	Yali si mulwadde.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
He was the best, and he knew it.	Ye yali asinga obulungi, era yali akimanyi.
I have my work to do too.	Nange nnina omulimu gwange gwe nnina okukola.
I know it’s going to happen.	Nkimanyi nti kigenda kubaawo.
He had no problem with that.	Ekyo yali talina buzibu bwonna.
I'll go now.	Nja kugenda kati.
I'm sure this will be easy, though.	Nkakasa nti kino kijja kuba kyangu, wadde.
Here we all were.	Wano ffenna twali.
Probably me too.	Oboolyawo nange.
You are in a very dangerous situation for yourself.	Oli mu mbeera ya bulabe nnyo gyoli.
And now, my son .	Era kati, mwana wange .
Reading or eating.	Okusoma oba okulya.
I was a human being.	Nze nali muntu.
He was my friend.	Yali mukwano gwange.
I'll try it.	Nja kugezaako.
I knew it at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali nkimanyi.
I won’t answer, not now.	Sijja kuddamu, si kati.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
He said he loved it.	Yagambye nti ayagala nnyo.
You can do that.	Ekyo osobola okukikola.
This picture is really important.	Ekifaananyi kino kikulu nnyo ddala.
From the.	Okuva mu.
You can help.	Osobola okuyamba.
We’re almost there.	Tuli kumpi awo.
That was important to know.	Ekyo kyali kikulu okumanya.
That’s what he knew.	Ekyo kye yali amanyi.
I have a plan.	Nnina enteekateeka.
And that’s not a bad thing.	Era ekyo si kibi.
I don’t have the right answer.	Sirina kya kuddamu kituufu.
I wasn’t sure which.	Nali sikakasa ki.
It looks good on you.	Kirabika bulungi ku ggwe.
That was good to see.	Ekyo kyali kirungi okulaba.
I can’t even talk to you.	Sisobola na kwogera naawe.
No one will ever know you were involved.	Tewali ajja kumanya nti wali mu nsonga eno.
I need it.	Nze nneetaaga.
I think you’re sick.	Ndowooza nti oli mulwadde.
I just wanted to be a kid.	Nnali njagala kubeera mwana muto kyokka.
He had been asleep.	Yali abadde yeebase.
It is already here, always.	Kiri wano dda, bulijjo.
No one knows what to say.	Tewali amanyi kya kwogera.
He was well aware of that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi bulungi.
We can’t go everywhere.	Tetusobola kugenda mu buli kifo.
He obviously has his thing.	Kya lwatu nti alina ekintu kye.
He is an actor.	Ye muzannyi wa firimu.
I don’t know what to do about that.	Ekyo simanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo.
And with him.	Era naye.
I might be the same.	Nze nnyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
I thought you said you wanted to help.	Nalowooza nti wagamba nti oyagala kuyamba.
He is all over the place.	Ali mu kifo kyonna.
He knew this was here, he really did.	Yali akimanyi nti kino kiri wano, ddala yali akimanyi.
In fact, it would be much easier.	Mu butuufu kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
He is a good friend of mine.	Ye mukwano gwange omulungi.
He is with us.	Ali naffe.
He is such a nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi bwatyo.
But that is not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu.
That looks really good.	Ekyo kirabika bulungi ddala.
One phone call.	Essimu emu.
He was one and everything, really.	Yali omu ne buli kimu, ddala.
. . . .	.
I don’t even know who you are.	Simanyi na ggwe ani.
I’ve been busy.	Nze mbadde bbize.
I can't believe he's really mine.	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ddala wa kubeera wange.
Or both of us.	Oba ffembi.
This is all.	Kino kyonna.
But you know it’s happening.	Naye omanyi nti kigenda mu maaso.
I know you love shopping.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala nnyo okugula ebintu.
He was stronger than you thought.	Yali wa maanyi okusinga bwe wali olowooza.
Probably a good thing.	Oboolyawo kintu kirungi.
That can be a challenge.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kizibu.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
I will mention one.	Nja kwogera ku kimu.
You have a lot of money.	Olina ssente nnyingi.
You know where you are, of course.	Omanyi gy’oli, ddala.
He says he doesn’t know why.	Agamba nti tamanyi lwaki.
He said nothing at all.	Tewali kye yayogera n’akatono.
She likes to be alone.	Ayagala nnyo okubeera yekka.
That wasn’t the issue.	Eyo si ye yali ensonga.
But he knew who.	Naye yali amanyi ani.
Now, very much so.	Kati, nnyo nnyo.
He would be fine now.	Yandibadde bulungi kati.
He needed to eat more.	Yali yeetaaga okulya ennyo.
And I’m not the only one.	Era si nze nzekka.
It looks like an office, my father’s office.	Kirabika ofiisi, ofiisi ya taata.
For an hour nothing seems to happen.	Okumala essaawa emu nga tewali kirabika kigenda mu maaso.
You know that now.	Ekyo okimanyi kati.
It would have been me.	Kyandibadde nze.
You’ll come, won’t you?	Ojja kujja, si bwe kiri?
He felt a little better that way.	Yawulira bulungi katono bw’atyo.
But there is nothing we can do.	Naye tewali kye tusobola kukola.
Money, money, money!	Ssente, ssente, ssente!
He looked sleepy, happy.	Yalabika nga yeebase, nga musanyufu.
He can’t do this thing.	Tasobola kukola kintu kino.
He wants me not him.	Ayagala nze si ye.
I wanted to be that guy.	Nnali njagala kubeera ggaayi oyo.
Or maybe not.	Oba mpozzi nedda.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
I wish it was more complicated.	Njagala nnyo singa kyali kizibu nnyo.
He is my son.	Ye mwana wange.
He loves it really.	Ayagala nnyo ddala.
And we will do it.	Era tujja kukikola.
And he will know where.	Era ajja kumanya wa.
I’m not ready.	Nze siri mwetegefu.
And he comes and you know.	Era ajja era omanyi.
I don't know what it is.	Simanyi kya kiki.
Everyone thought it was great.	Buli omu yalowooza nti kirungi nnyo.
And you.	Naawe.
And not now.	Era si kati.
But this is not my point.	Naye eno si y’ensonga yange.
He knew that now.	Ekyo yali akimanyi kati.
Where?' 	Wa?'
This is nothing.	Kino si kintu kyonna.
But I, and everyone like me, wants to get.	Naye nze, era buli muntu nga nze, ayagala okufuna.
I love to cum.	Njagala nnyo okumala.
He has been very good.	Abadde mulungi nnyo.
Even for himself.	Ne ku ye kennyini.
But in reality this is not the case.	Naye mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
And that may well have been true.	Era ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kyali kituufu.
Better than he had in weeks.	Kirungi okusinga bwe yalina mu wiiki.
But that’s not realistic.	Naye ekyo si kya ddala.
Good job with this.	Omulimu omulungi ne kino.
I thought it was great.	Nalowooza nti kyali kirungi nnyo.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
He is ready to work.	Mwetegefu okukola.
He told me he was in his room.	Yang’amba nti yali mu kisenge kye.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
When he came.	Bwe yajja.
I don’t really want to do it.	Mu butuufu saagala kukikola.
But here’s where it goes.	Naye wano we kigenda.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
I need the money.	Nze nneetaaga ssente.
Now there is one.	Kati waliwo emu.
He loved this job.	Omulimu guno yali ayagala nnyo.
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza.
I don’t have time for everyone.	Sirina budde bwa buli muntu.
Not below.	Si wansi.
Not my father.	Si taata wange.
You will soon see that anyone.	Mu bbanga ttono ojja kulaba nti omuntu yenna.
Where could he go?	Yali asobola okugenda wa?
That was my point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga yange.
He worked hard.	Yakola nnyo.
They were here, now they’re not.	Baali wano, kati si bwe bali.
We have each other.	Tulina buli omu.
No, not below.	Nedda, si wansi.
I had no immediate idea to say.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kya mangu kya kwogera.
Now one thing.	Kati ekintu kimu.
If that were true.	Singa ekyo kyali kituufu.
I really don't know how to do this.	Mu butuufu simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukola kino.
I didn’t know what to expect.	Nnali simanyi kye nsuubira.
We have to do this now.	Kino tulina okukikola kati.
But he can’t.	Naye tasobola.
This is what he has wanted.	Kino abadde ayagala.
Probably what he would do.	Oboolyawo kye yandikoze.
He felt like he was.	Yawulira nga ye ky’ali.
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
But he had always been lucky.	Naye bulijjo yali abadde wa mukisa.
That you are not a good person.	Nti toli muntu mulungi.
He was ready, he knew it.	Yali mwetegefu, yali akimanyi.
I’m sorry it had to be you.	Nsonyiwa kyalina okuba ggwe.
I like to make things.	Njagala nnyo okukola ebintu.
Perhaps he knew it too.	Oboolyawo naye yali akimanyi.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
We can’t do it.	Tetusobola kukikola.
For whatever it was before.	Ku kyonna kye yali emabegako.
I think this is a bit too simplistic, though.	Ndowooza kino kyangu nnyo katono, wadde.
No one can do everything.	Tewali asobola kukola buli kimu.
Not driving a car.	Si kuvuga mmotoka.
Obviously you don’t.	Kya lwatu tolina.
Maybe now he could just .	Mpozzi kati yali asobola okumala .
Why not, he said.	Lwaki nedda, bwe yagambye.
Somewhere there now.	Waliwo awo kati.
It’s nothing of the sort.	Si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
That was a bad thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi.
I’m not sure if that’s the point though.	Sikakasa oba eyo y’ensonga wadde.
He wants to go home.	Ayagala kudda waka.
He couldn’t though.	Yali tasobola wadde.
And it’s very hard to do.	Era kizibu nnyo okukikola.
He is very	Ye nnyo .
It seems normal to me.	Kirabika nga kya bulijjo gyendi.
That could be any of us.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna ku ffe.
He wasn’t like that.	Yali si bw’atyo.
We were so close.	Twali kumpi nnyo.
And you think.	Era ggwe olowooza.
I don’t really want to.	Nze mu butuufu saagala.
I love dogs.	Njagala nnyo embwa.
My beautiful home.	Awaka wange omulungi.
She was beautiful, she thought.	Yali mulungi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
You have to do it yourself.	Ggwe kennyini olina okukikola.
And in truth, he was.	Era mu mazima, bw’atyo bwe yali.
I think it’s a good thing.	Ndowooza kintu kirungi.
It is very easy to deal with.	Kyangu nnyo okukola ku nsonga.
But that’s not my practice.	Naye ekyo si kye nkola yange.
I'm not so sure.	Sikakasa nnyo.
This is what it is now.	Kino kye kiri kati.
I don’t know what thing in advance.	Simanyi kintu ki nga bukyali.
We need to talk.	Twetaaga okwogera.
It’s not my thing.	Si kintu kyange.
No one was home.	Tewali yali awaka.
This can be a problem.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
We’re fine here.	Tuli bulungi wano.
We'll see.	Tujja kulaba.
This will help the problem.	Kino kijja kuyamba ekizibu.
He agreed immediately.	Yakkiriza mangu ddala.
There is no answer.	Tewali kuddamu.
That might work.	Ekyo kiyinza okukola.
In your opinion.	Mu ndowooza yo.
From the.	Okuva mu.
I don’t want to be his friend.	Saagala kubeera mukwano gwe.
But he knows it.	Naye akimanyi.
That’s not what matters.	Ekyo si kye kikulu.
I’m not feeling well.	Nze siri bulungi.
All right, you’re real.	Kirungi, oli wa ddala.
And you were there.	Ne ggwe wali.
No, certainly not today.	Nedda, mazima ddala si bwe kiri leero.
In fact, we can go on.	Mu butuufu, tusobola okugenda mu maaso.
You will do it too.	Naawe ojja kukikola.
I can’t tell.	Sisobola kumanya.
And well it might.	Era bulungi kiyinza.
He tried hard.	Yagezaako nnyo.
I’m not sure that.	Nze sikakasa nti.
That was my problem.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
Well! 	Bulungi!
And so do you.	Era naawe.
It was a wonderful atmosphere.	Yali mbeera nnungi nnyo.
Soon he will be exactly like you.	Mu bbanga ttono ajja kuba nga ggwe ddala.
That would be .	Ekyo kyandibadde .
It’s not wrong to think hard.	Si kibi okulowooza ennyo.
And then he couldn’t.	Era awo nga tasobola.
You know this.	Kino okimanyi.
And well he might.	Era bulungi ayinza.
That’s what everyone has.	Ekyo buli muntu alina.
But it’s not the same.	Naye si kye kimu.
It can be really hard.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu ddala.
In that sense, he said.	Mu ngeri eyo, bwe yagamba.
It was time to think of you.	Kyali kiseera okulowooza ku ggwe.
That 's one thing.	Ekyo 'ekintu kimu.
That’s not true!	Ekyo si kituufu!
This is all my opinion.	Kino kyonna kye ndowooza yange.
Before .	Nga tannaba .
Not a bad idea at all.	Si kirowoozo kibi n’akatono.
This is important in many applications.	Kino kikulu mu nkola nnyingi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I really didn’t know what to say.	Mazima ddala nnali simanyi kya kwogera.
That doesn’t matter.	Ekyo si kikulu.
I don’t really care what they are.	Sifaayo nnyo ku kye bali.
And in many ways, that was it.	Era mu ngeri nnyingi, ekyo kye kyali.
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
I knew it was him.	Namanya nti ye ye.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
You’ve probably been here before.	Oboolyawo wali wano emabegako.
You nor anyone else.	Ggwe wadde omuntu omulala yenna.
You work hard.	Okola nnyo.
He tried to go to work, too.	Yagezaako okugenda ku mulimu, naye.
He didn't know where.	Yali tamanyi wa.
And that’s what you wanted too.	Era naawe kye wali oyagala.
He liked to talk a lot.	Yali ayagala nnyo okwogera ennyo.
You’re with him.	Oli naye.
Perhaps it would be.	Oboolyawo kyandibadde.
That's the point.	Eyo y'ensonga.
I'm fine.	Ndi bulungi.
That dog is asleep.	Embwa eyo yeebase.
You know that you have.	Omanyi nti olina.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
You certainly know.	Mazima ddala omanyi.
I had nothing to say.	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera.
It’s not easy, but it’s easy.	Si kyangu, naye kyangu.
It’s not exactly easy to say clearly.	Si kyangu ddala kwogera bulungi.
You can go faster.	Osobola okugenda amangu.
Apparently it isn’t.	Kirabika si bwe kiri.
I know it’s bad for me.	Nkimanyi nti kibi gyendi.
The same goes for you.	Kye kimu kigenda ku ggwe.
He has a difficult problem.	Alina ekizibu ekizibu.
But there is one thing everyone needs to know.	Naye waliwo ekintu kimu buli muntu ky’alina okumanya.
I am not a good patient.	Siri mulwadde mulungi.
He was no good at being alone.	Yali talina mulungi mu kubeera yekka.
That’s all he said.	Ekyo kyokka kye yayogera.
But we need to move forward.	Naye twetaaga okugenda mu maaso.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
And it is very powerful.	Era nga kya maanyi nnyo.
It was a very powerful moment for me.	Kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo gyendi.
But it isn’t.	Naye nedda.
And here he is.	Naye oyo ye.
Police at the time.	Poliisi mu kiseera ekyo.
Sorry.	Nsonyiwa.
However, it is probably too much time.	Kyokka, oboolyawo obudde bungi nnyo.
However, this was problematic in practice.	Kyokka kino kyali kizibu mu nkola.
We could see that.	Ekyo twali tusobola okulaba.
Not like him.	Si nga ye.
He really can work.	Ddala asobola okukola.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
He probably didn’t know what it was.	Oboolyawo yali tamanyi kye kyali.
He doesn’t have to stay.	Talina kusigala.
Now he doesn’t want to at all.	Kati tayagala n’akatono.
He thinks this is a good idea.	Alowooza nti endowooza eno nnungi.
He spoke for an hour.	Yayogera okumala essaawa emu.
You know you want to!.	Omanyi oyagala!.
He's really good.	Ddala mulungi.
He loved to drive his car.	Yali ayagala nnyo okuvuga mmotoka ye.
No one knows what will happen.	Tewali amanyi kijja kubaawo.
Now Dad you’re going to be a doctor!	Kati taata ogenda kubeera musawo!
Now they were here.	Kati baali wano.
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
Or not you now.	Oba si ggwe kati.
Everything was fine.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi.
Maybe he will truly do it.	Mpozzi ajja kukikola mu mazima.
We have to have those.	Tulina okuba nga tulina ebyo.
How much does he make.	Akola mmeka.
There is something for everyone here.	Waliwo ekintu kya buli muntu wano.
I couldn’t, of course.	Nnali sisobola, ddala.
It was actually really easy.	Mu butuufu kyali kyangu ddala.
That is the only truth.	Ekyo kye kituufu kyokka.
Maybe it’s not true.	Mpozzi nga si kituufu.
It’s much more complicated than that.	Kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
Now we have to be going.	Kati tulina okuba nga tugenda.
This isn’t just me.	Kino si kyange nzekka.
Everything looks great.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi nnyo.
I can’t be the only person here.	Siyinza kuba muntu nzekka wano.
But there it is.	Naye awo we kiri.
I'm one.	Nze' omu.
It's good for you.	Kirungi gy'oli.
It’s really awful.	Ddala kibi nnyo.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
He looked unhappy.	Yalabika nga si musanyufu.
Getting to the house.	Okutuuka mu nnyumba.
Do you want it now?	Oyagala kati?
Just like before but much stronger.	Nga bwe kyali emabegako naye nga kya maanyi nnyo.
Good job!	Omulimu omulungi!
He was a very busy man.	Yali musajja bbize nnyo.
That feature can take many forms.	Ekintu ekyo kiyinza okubeera mu ngeri nnyingi.
My father goes to work every morning.	Taata agenda ku mulimu buli ku makya.
And he can’t do that.	Era ekyo tasobola kukikola.
Not in his time.	Si mu kiseera kye.
He says of course you can.	Agamba nti ddala osobola.
Not for anyone.	Si lwa muntu yenna.
He knew what he wanted.	Yali amanyi kye yali ayagala.
In this way please.	Mu ngeri eno nsaba.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
As it really was.	Nga bwe kyali ddala.
He has been doing that a lot.	Ekyo abadde akikola nnyo.
Perhaps that was true.	Oboolyawo ekyo kyali kituufu.
The problem is that he was actually right.	Obuzibu buli nti mu butuufu yali mu butuufu.
Not exactly at the same time, he thought.	Si mu kiseera kye kimu ddala, bwe yalowooza.
Now, it’s up to you.	Kati, kiri gy’oli.
And he has been doing well.	Era abadde akola bulungi.
He knows what he is.	Amanyi ky’ali.
It is a practical problem.	Kizibu kya nkola.
We have to earn money.	Tulina okufuna ssente.
I was nothing and nobody.	Nze nali si kintu era nga sirina muntu yenna.
Everyone has to talk to me.	Buli omu alina okwogera nange.
Here is a good one.	Wano waliwo omulungi.
That’s a lot of it.	Ebyo bingi nnyo.
Now it’s not a bad thing.	Kati si kibi.
It’s not about anything.	Si kya kintu kyonna.
But this is what he did.	Naye kino kye yakola.
That was easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu.
He knows that too.	Ekyo naye akimanyi.
But that will only last a short time.	Naye ekyo kijja kumala akaseera katono ddala.
However, doing this well is not easy.	Kyokka kino okukola obulungi si kyangu.
He’s just trying to do what he has to do.	Agezaako kukola ku ky’alina okukola kyokka.
He is a strong man.	Musajja wa maanyi.
He was powerless.	Yali talina maanyi.
No real man does that.	Tewali musajja ddala akola ekyo.
But you have to go.	Naye olina okugenda.
For a while, they were friends.	Okumala akaseera, baali ba mukwano.
, and.	, ne.
And his brother came too.	Era muganda we naye yajja.
I will know at this point.	Nja kumanya mu kiseera kino.
I'm not sure at this point.	Sikakasa mu kiseera kino.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
I feel like I’m sick.	Mpulira nga ndi mulwadde.
You probably have one too.	Oboolyawo naawe olina emu.
Very helpful.	Obuyambi bungi nnyo.
He heard more than he saw.	Yawulira okusinga okulaba.
It doesn’t matter who.	Si kikulu ani.
That may have been a problem.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kyali kizibu.
And so do we.	Era naffe.
No way, baby.	Tewali ngeri ki mwana wange.
We can’t with this right now.	Tetusobola na kino mu kiseera kino.
And you mostly.	Era ggwe okusinga.
He did just that.	Yakola bw’atyo.
I have to be good.	Nnina okuba omulungi.
It will be everywhere.	Kijja kuba buli wamu.
She would be a woman.	Yandibadde mukyala.
He needed a plan for this.	Kino yali yeetaaga enteekateeka.
He knows now.	Amanyi kati.
He was almost there.	Yali kumpi awo.
It can work.	Kiyinza okukola.
I don’t like this.	Kino sikyagala.
You will be very happy.	Ojja kuba musanyufu nnyo.
I will do that in the morning.	Ekyo nja kukikola ku makya.
He has been very good.	Abadde mulungi nnyo.
This feels certain.	Kino mpulira nga nkakasa.
I don't know where.	Simanyi wa.
Who did this?	Kino ani yakikola?
Do you like to eat?	Oyagala nnyo okulya?
Not just me but you too.	Si nze nzekka naye naawe.
I think it was very important.	Ndowooza kyali kikulu nnyo.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Si kintu kyangu kukola.
He can’t believe it’s me.	Tayinza kukkiriza nti nze.
I don’t want to talk.	Sikyagala kwogera.
But there was nothing.	Naye nga tewali kintu kyonna.
It was him.	Yali ye.
Not really, no.	Si ddala, nedda.
You don’t have to see anything.	Tolina kulaba kintu kyonna.
I can never know how it was.	Siyinza kumanya ngeri gye kyali.
He didn't know what to do.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola.
If he could just get to them.	Singa asobola okumala okutuuka gye bali.
He can’t do anything.	Tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
Like really hungry.	Nga ddala enjala.
He too, obviously.	Ye naye, kya lwatu.
You’re in luck.	Oli mu mukisa.
She said she needed his help.	Yagamba nti yali yeetaaga obuyambi bwe.
It’s not a good answer.	Si kya kuddamu kirungi.
It is a real place.	Kifo kya ddala.
But you are ahead.	Naye ggwe oli mu maaso.
Or anything, really.	Oba ekintu kyonna, ddala.
Nothing was an issue.	Tewali kyali nsonga.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He goes with her.	Agenda naye.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
But he did it very well.	Naye yakikola bulungi nnyo.
Here we go.	Wano we tugenda.
That's you? 	Oyo ggwe?
He had been out of hospital for a long time.	Yali amaze ebbanga nga talina ddwaaliro.
And so far, it’s going well.	Era okutuusa kati, kigenda bulungi.
I think that’s why he doesn’t want to go to the doctor.	Ndowooza y’ensonga lwaki tayagala kugenda wa musawo.
Nothing will do the same.	Tewali kintu kyonna kijja kukola kye kimu.
Hope is so great.	Essuubi ddene nnyo.
I already knew that too.	Ekyo nange nnali mmanyi dda.
I’m working hard now.	Nze nkola nnyo kati.
Certainly not for me.	Mazima si gyendi.
To you, to me, to everyone here.	Eri ggwe, gyendi, eri buli muntu ali wano.
I really don’t know.	Mazima ddala simanyi.
It could be anyone.	Kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
He didn't have time before, but now he would.	Yali talina budde emabegako, naye kati yandibadde.
In a sense it is true.	Mu ngeri emu kituufu.
Not without his help.	Si nga talina buyambi bwe.
I do know one thing.	Nze mmanyi ekintu kimu.
He was very happy with himself.	Yali musanyufu nnyo eri ye kennyini.
Not in here.	Si mu wano.
You are nothing to me.	Ggwe toli kintu kyonna gyendi.
Everyone can see what it is.	Buli muntu asobola okulaba kye kiri.
There is no answer!	Tewali kuddamu!
Obviously, it’s not the same thing.	Kya lwatu nti si kintu kye kimu.
We need a lot of money.	Twetaaga ssente nnyingi.
I would like to say that.	Njagala okugamba nti.
However, that is just an idea.	Kyokka ekyo kirowoozo kyokka.
Maybe he's asleep now.	Mpozzi kati yeebase.
I hope you don’t mind.	Nsuubira nti tolina buzibu.
Not now, anyway.	Si kati, mu ngeri yonna.
Not himself.	Si ye kennyini.
I know that very well.	Ekyo nkimanyi nnyo.
And tomorrow.	Era enkya.
I was hoping it would be good.	Nali nsuubira nti kijja kuba kirungi.
Apparently he had no interest.	Kirabika yali talina ky’ayagala.
to a friend ??????????.	eri mukwano gwe ??????????.
Who knows why.	Ani amanyi lwaki.
Now they are.	Kati bali.
Now there is none.	Kati tewali.
And he actually has been for a while.	Era mu butuufu amaze akaseera.
This is the whole point.	Eno y’ensonga yonna.
You have to leave this place, now.	Olina okuva mu kifo kino, kati.
He wants to win.	Ayagala kuwangula.
We don’t have to buy.	Tetulina kugula.
For one night.	Okumala ekiro kimu.
And it was true.	Era kyali kituufu.
I thought it was you.	Nalowooza nti ggwe.
I will do better but this was really low and very difficult.	Nja kukola bulungi naye kino ddala kyali kya wansi era nga kizibu nnyo.
I thought he was very, very dangerous.	Nalowooza nti yali wa bulabe nnyo nnyo.
That would be a good thing.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu kirungi.
He does a good job.	Akola omulimu mulungi.
It would be for.	Kyandibadde kya lwa...
I don’t care to do it.	Nze sifaayo kukikola.
Now, everyone is happy.	Kati, buli omu musanyufu.
I was expecting it	Nnali nsuubira
I really don't care.	Mazima ddala sifaayo.
But no, no there isn't.	Naye nedda, nedda tewali.
In many ways, that was true.	Mu ngeri nnyingi, ekyo kyali kituufu.
At that point nothing could be better.	Mu kiseera ekyo tewali kiyinza kuba kirungi okusinga kino.
He came up with the money himself.	Yajja ne ssente ye kennyini.
He knows so much.	Amanyi bingi nnyo.
That's the only problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyokka.
We have to make time.	Tulina okukola obudde.
It was very common.	Kyali kya bulijjo nnyo.
I didn’t want to.	Nnali saagala.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
That’s no problem at all.	Ekyo tewali buzibu bwonna.
He has to know.	Alina okumanya.
We have to do the same.	Naffe tulina okukola kye kimu.
But we have it.	Naye tulina.
He knew it was true.	Yali akimanyi nti kituufu.
Same thing in movies.	Ekintu kye kimu ne mu firimu.
He is still here.	Akyali wano.
We should actually be going for that.	Mu butuufu tusaanidde okuba nga tugenda ku ekyo.
It’s getting harder to find time to read.	Kigenda kizibu okufuna obudde okusoma.
He is not happy.	Tali musanyufu.
He is really good.	Ye mulungi ddala.
As difficult as it is.	Nga bwe kiri nga kizibu.
And you know it, too.	Era naawe okimanyi.
I needed this to happen.	Kino nnali nneetaaga okubaawo.
Not that we should read too much into this.	Si nti tusaanidde okusoma ennyo mu kino.
Anyone can do it.	Omuntu yenna asobola okukikola.
I’ll be here, whatever happens.	Nja kuba wano, kyonna ekigenda okubaawo.
This was his favorite thing.	Kino kye kyali ekintu kye yali ayagala ennyo.
I can’t do that myself.	Sisobola kukola ekyo nze kennyini.
His manner was friendly.	Engeri ye yali ya mukwano.
Maybe there is.	Mpozzi nga waliwo.
Not that it’s a bad idea.	Si nti kirowoozo kibi.
I hear things.	Mpulira ebintu.
It seems to be everywhere together now.	Kirabika buli wamu wamu kati.
He was very busy.	Yali bbize nnyo.
It’s not love.	Si kwagala.
And now you are.	Era kati ggwe.
He has been working hard!	Abadde akola nnyo!
It was really good.	Yali nnungi ddala.
You can do it too.	Naawe osobola.
And yet here we are, he said.	Era naye wano we tuli, bwe yagambye.
It was time to go.	Kyali kiseera kya kugenda.
He looked asleep.	Yalabika nga yeebase.
However, I can.	Kyokka nsobola.
And here you have it.	Era wano ggwe olina.
But that’s not really what was going on here.	Naye ekyo si kye kyali kigenda mu maaso wano ddala.
I have always been working.	Bulijjo mbadde nkola.
No one did anything.	Tewali yakola kintu kyonna.
She looks absolutely beautiful.	Alabika bulungi ddala.
Perhaps someone else has.	Oboolyawo omuntu omulala alina.
Sorry.	Nsonyiwa.
Like, a lot.	Nga, bingi.
I can’t wait to try that.	Siyinza kulinda kugezaako ekyo.
Who lives in that house there?	Ani abeera mu nnyumba eyo eyo?
I don’t know anything about you.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ggwe.
It’s not going back.	Si kudda.
And there’s someone else in the room.	Era waliwo omuntu omulala mu kisenge.
This is important to me.	Kino kikulu gyendi.
I know it’s in mine too.	Nkimanyi nti nange kiri mu kyange.
And things like that.	Era ebintu nga ebyo.
No one was around him.	Tewali muntu yenna yali kumpi naye.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
There is no problem there.	Tewali buzibu awo.
He had it coming.	Yalina nga kijja.
I hope it will happen.	Nsuubira nti kijja kubaawo.
There is really nothing to do now.	Mu butuufu kati tewali kya kukola.
I'm not the one.	Si nze ye.
Soon my friend.	Mu bbanga ttono mukwano gwange.
This is mine too.	Eno ye naye yange.
I think everywhere.	Ndowooza buli wamu.
He couldn't, not in this case.	Yali tasobola, si mu mbeera eno.
No time for that now.	Tewali budde bwa ekyo kati.
You’re doing well.	Okola bulungi.
I couldn’t deal with what he was doing.	Nnali sisobola kukola ku kye yali akola.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
There is no gap.	Tewali bbanga.
He was in a hurry.	Yali mu bwangu.
It was very dangerous for them.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo gye bali.
But happy and cheerful.	Naye nga musanyufu era nga musanyufu.
But, of course, he had to go.	Naye, kya lwatu, yalina okugenda.
As it was the case.	Nga bwe kyali.
He will never be there again.	Tagenda kuddamu kubeerawo.
And the food got, same as always.	Era emmere yafuna, kye kimu nga bulijjo.
He thought it was something.	Yalowooza nti yali kintu.
I will have time for this.	Kino nja kufuna obudde.
I was there at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali awo.
Good job.	Omulimu mulungi.
I'm a good guy when I'm in trouble.	Ndi ggaayi mulungi nga nfunye obuzibu.
And it’s very simple, of course.	Era kyangu nnyo, ddala.
This was all that seemed real.	Kino kyonna kye kyali kirabika nga kya ddala.
Anything would be better than this.	Ekintu kyonna kyandibadde kirungi okusinga kino.
You can’t tell.	Tosobola kumanya.
I didn’t want to do it now.	Nnali saagala kukikola kati.
He is nearby.	Ali kumpi.
He talks about his plans for this weekend.	Ayogera ku nteekateeka ze ku wiikendi eno.
I needed to do it.	Nnali nneetaaga okukikola.
He'll talk to me alone, now.	Ajja kwogera nange nzekka, kati.
It was time he was thinking about a wife too.	Kye kiseera naye yali alowooza ku mukyala.
He does everything in His time.	Buli kimu akikola mu kiseera kye.
It’s a matter of policy.	Ensonga ya nkola.
I don’t know who you are.	Simanyi ggwe ani.
Same thing with me.	Ekintu kye kimu ne nange.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
You’re fine, too.	Naawe oli bulungi.
That is what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
But perhaps it’s not as complicated as it sounds.	Naye mpozzi si kizibu nga bwe kirabika.
He goes, you go.	Agenda, ggwe ogenda.
He didn't know what to say.	Yali tamanyi kya kwogera.
Someone else was in the room.	Omuntu omulala yali mu kisenge.
Know.	Okumanya.
You will do what you want anyway.	Ojja kukola kyoyagala mu ngeri yonna.
But that will never happen again.	Naye ekyo tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
Like, everything.	Nga, byonna.
Down to nothing.	Wansi okutuuka ku tewali.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He's there.	Ali awo.
What a nice man you are.	Nga oli musajja mulungi.
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't have to.	Nkakasa bulungi nti talina kukikola.
They are not.	Si bwe bali.
His phone started ringing.	Essimu ye yatandika okukuba.
Everything he needed.	Byonna bye yali yeetaaga.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
This does not seem to be the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
Shopping is hard work.	Okugula ebintu mulimu gwa maanyi.
He can’t do this.	Kino tasobola kukikola.
I want to be on this.	Njagala kubeera ku kino.
But he felt the same way about me.	Naye naye yawulira bw’atyo ku nze.
I just didn’t know.	Nze nali simanyi kyokka.
Clearly, that is not the case.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
No one here is.	Tewali muntu yenna wano ali.
What a beautiful morning!	Enkya nga nnungi nnyo!
He is very beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo.
He won’t believe it at all!	Tajja kukkiriza n’akatono!
He is always very happy.	Bulijjo musanyufu nnyo.
I'll go with him.	Nja kugenda naye.
Really, nothing.	Ddala, tewali kintu kyonna.
No one but me.	Tewali muntu yenna okuggyako nze.
It just comes along.	Kijja kyokka.
There is no party here.	Tewali kibiina wano.
You're fine.	Oli bulungi.
But nothing is normal.	Naye tewali kintu kya bulijjo.
He needed a friend.	Yali yeetaaga mukwano gwe.
Now, it’s not just the idea.	Kati, si kye kirowoozo kyokka.
I felt so good about that.	Ekyo nnali mpulira bulungi nnyo.
However, this is not entirely true.	Kyokka, kino si kituufu ddala.
It’s a good movie.	Firimu nnungi.
I hope you will succeed.	Nsuubira nti ojja kusobola.
He can be both.	Asobola okuba bombi.
And he has something.	Era alina ky’alina.
He needs someone like you.	Yeetaaga omuntu nga ggwe.
No one told me that.	Ekyo tewali yang’amba.
And in this case.	Era mu mbeera eno.
It’s not too difficult.	Si kizibu nnyo.
But that was normal.	Naye ekyo kyali kya bulijjo.
Now that’s not quite true.	Kati ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
I’m going to be sick.	Ngenda kubeera mulwadde.
We don’t have much time.	Tetulina budde bungi.
I always loved to swim.	Bulijjo nnali njagala nnyo okuwuga.
None of this is bad in any way.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kibi mu ngeri yonna.
My father got a job.	Taata yafuna omulimu.
It would be very dangerous.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe nnyo.
It doesn’t matter which one.	Si kikulu ki ki.
I have to get back to being me.	Nnina okudda mu kubeera nze.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
But there was no .	Naye nga tewali .
I’ve needed someone.	Nze mbadde nneetaaga omuntu.
I can’t keep doing this.	Kino sisobola kusigala nga nkola.
It was coming.	Kyali kijja.
In any case.	Mu ngeri yonna.
I will never have an opinion again.	Sijja kuddamu kuba na ndowooza.
Actually, maybe you can answer this.	Mu butuufu, mpozzi kino osobola okuddamu.
I needed his help right now.	Nnali nneetaaga obuyambi bwe mu kiseera kino.
There are so many.	Bingi nnyo.
Where is his office.	Ofiisi ye eri ludda wa.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
It was a serious problem.	Kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
It is a form of love.	Kye ngeri ya kwagala.
And he is.	Era ye.
I don’t know how to love a man.	Simanyi kwagala musajja.
Now it is not.	Kati si bwe kiri.
I hope you do too.	Nsuubira nti naawe okola.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
Obviously, nothing goes to plan.	Kya lwatu nti tewali kigenda mu nteekateeka.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Simanyi kigenda mu maaso.
You are in my house.	Oli mu nnyumba yange.
Same thing with the bottom.	Ekintu kye kimu ne wansi.
You have to talk to him.	Olina okwogera naye.
Something or someone.	Ekintu oba omuntu.
Easier said than done.	Kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
That would be very difficult.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
He did this now.	Kino yakikola kati.
I was his best friend.	Nze nali mukwano gwe ddala.
From any city.	Okuva mu kibuga kyonna.
Police are responding.	Poliisi eri mu kuddamu.
He's a nice guy, would you like.	Ye ggaayi mulungi, wandyagadde.
We are the power.	Ffe tuli maanyi.
Everything we needed.	Buli kye twali twetaaga.
He won’t tell anyone.	Tajja kubuulira muntu yenna.
It was definitely a lot of talking.	Mazima ddala yali kwogera nnyo.
That’s not true.	Si ekyo kituufu.
Reverse.	Okudda emabega.
He did that thing there.	Ekintu ekyo yakikola eyo.
Everyone he loved.	Buli muntu gwe yali ayagala.
That’s not what it is.	Ekyo si kye kiri.
I hope he can find a job soon.	Nsuubira nti asobola okufuna omulimu mu bbanga ttono.
No luck at all.	Tewali mukisa n’akatono.
I am here and you are there.	Nze ndi wano naawe oli awo.
He didn’t know how bad it was.	Yali tamanyi ngeri gye kyali kibi.
Certainly not me.	Mazima ddala si nze.
He needed to do this quickly.	Kino yali yeetaaga okukikola amangu.
Even when he was .	Ne bwe yali .
You can leave here tomorrow.	Osobola okuva wano enkya.
He certainly was.	Mazima ddala yali.
But that is not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu.
He wasn't ready, he wasn't ready.	Yali si mwetegefu, yali si mwetegefu.
Here you go.	Wano ogenda.
Much the same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu nnyo.
You can do it yourself.	Osobola okukikola wekka.
He saw his point.	Yalaba ensonga ye.
In fact, it may be the only one.	Mu butuufu, kiyinza okuba nga kye kyokka.
Back home though.	Okudda eka wadde.
Maybe no one knew.	Mpozzi nga tewali yali amanyi.
Not, yet anyway.	Si, n’okutuusa kati mu ngeri yonna.
It was what everyone thought.	Kyali ekyo buli omu kye yalowooza.
In the future with me.	Mu maaso nange.
He loved it here.	Yali ayagala nnyo wano.
And it isn’t.	Era si bwe kiri.
We, you and I.	Ffe, nze naawe.
You don’t have me.	Ggwe tolina nze.
He hoped he was.	Yalina essuubi nti bwe yali.
Now it won’t happen.	Kati tekijja kubaawo.
Only one person in the house would do that.	Omuntu omu yekka mu nnyumba yandikoze ekyo.
This does not seem to be the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
That can be a challenge.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
That’s obviously not true.	Ekyo kya lwatu si kituufu.
I think he didn’t know what to do.	Ndowooza nti yali tamanyi kya kukola.
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
And we were going to spend a week in each.	Era twali tugenda kumala wiiki emu mu buli emu.
. . . .	.
That’s what he wanted.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala.
Now we will do it.	Kati tujja kukikola.
You knew that up front.	Ekyo wali okimanyi mu maaso.
He was actually curious.	Mu butuufu yali ayagala kumanya.
This is the only one.	Kino kyokka.
You can’t quite believe it.	Tosobola bulungi kukkiriza.
We will do this below.	Kino tujja kukikola wansi.
You’ll do it.	Ojja kukola.
In there a long time.	Mu eyo ebbanga ddene.
But you’re probably not in that situation.	Naye osanga toli mu mbeera eyo.
But there was nothing.	Naye nga tewali.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
He is here with us in this room.	Ali wano naffe mu kisenge kino.
Really.	Kituufu.
This is what I love.	Kino kye njagala ennyo.
He certainly doesn’t know himself.	Mazima ddala ye kennyini tamanyi.
It was a really hard thing to do.	Ddala kyali kintu kizibu okukola.
I can’t say why.	Siyinza kwogera lwaki.
That's where it is.	Awo we kiri.
I think my point is this.	Ndowooza ensonga yange eri eno.
We will go alone.	Tujja kugenda ffekka.
Maybe he didn’t really want to know.	Mpozzi nga mu butuufu yali tayagala kumanya.
You have to consider everyone’s situation.	Olina okulowooza ku mbeera ya buli muntu.
This is not the place to do that.	Kino si kifo kya kukola ekyo.
It’s not a good movie.	Si firimu nnungi.
But apparently this is not the case.	Naye kirabika kino si bwe kiri.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukola.
He is a very happy child.	Ye mwana musanyufu nnyo.
It was for me.	Kyali eri nze.
I love to read.	Njagala nnyo okusoma.
Like anything you want.	Nga ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala.
He had been a little better.	Yali abadde bulungi katono.
Here it is.	Wano we wali.
That's who he is.	Oyo y'ali.
I have no idea where we are.	Sirina kye mmanyi gye tuli.
Nothing to say about the process.	Tewali kya kwogera ku nkola.
I have to go quickly.	Nnina okugenda amangu.
He was willing.	Yali ayagala.
He is the only one.	Ye yekka.
And then there you are.	Era awo waliwo ggwe.
Everything was on schedule.	Buli kimu kyali ku nteekateeka.
You will do well.	Ojja kukola bulungi.
He is ready.	Ye mwetegefu.
He seemed to have no problem moving on now.	Yalabika nga talina buzibu kugenda mu maaso kati.
Eat.	Okulya.
He lives in the city.	Abeera mu kibuga.
It is very close.	Kiri kumpi nnyo.
Nothing good about it.	Tewali kirungi ku nsonga eyo.
They certainly were.	Mazima ddala baali.
He was in this state for a long time.	Yali mu mbeera eno okumala ebbanga ddene.
He knew it better than himself.	Yali akimanyi bulungi okusinga ye kennyini.
And you want what he wants.	Era oyagala ky’ayagala.
He knows it.	Akimanyi.
We have it.	Tulina.
And he said now we have to talk.	Era yagamba kati tulina okwogera.
I thought telling a friend would be a good idea.	Nalowooza nti okubuulira mukwano gwange kyandibadde kirungi.
He just wants to work.	Ayagala kukola kyokka.
I'll be back soon.	Nja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
And everywhere.	Era buli wamu.
He knows he is not alone.	Akimanyi nti si ye yekka.
It was intense, of course.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo, ddala.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
Nobody really knows much about it.	Mu butuufu tewali amanyi bingi ku nsonga eyo.
Dogs are man’s best friend.	Embwa mukwano gwa muntu asinga.
But that doesn’t matter.	Naye ekyo si kikulu.
You're a father.	Oli taata.
It wasn’t the weather.	Si yali mbeera ya budde.
He was really fast.	Ddala yali wa bwangu.
He couldn’t work.	Yali tasobola kukola.
This was his real thing.	Kino kye kyali ekintu kye ddala.
More than that, there is so much more.	Okusinga awo, waliwo bingi nnyo.
He had an opinion.	Yali alina endowooza.
We can’t tell that it’s really not good.	Tetusobola kumanya nti ddala si kirungi.
And even then.	Era ne mu kiseera ekyo.
But he didn't want to believe that.	Naye ekyo yali tayagala kukkiriza.
In fact, he had.	Mu butuufu, yalina.
He had a feeling it wasn’t his business.	Yalina endowooza nti si nsonga ye.
We will be more vulnerable than we currently are.	Tujja kuba mu bulabe bungi okusinga bwe tuli mu kiseera kino.
But he was .	Naye yali .
Maybe not immediately, but soon.	Mpozzi si mu bwangu, naye mu bbanga ttono.
And now or not.	Era kati oba si bwe kiri.
It’s much easier that way.	Kyangu nnyo mu ngeri eyo.
He always does well.	Bulijjo akola bulungi.
That was him, too.	Oyo naye yali ye.
He was very strong in his own way.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo mu ngeri ye.
This is what he wanted.	Kino yali ayagala.
In fact, no one can.	Mu butuufu tewali asobola.
We can be here.	Tusobola okuba wano.
It’s one of those things.	Kye kimu ku ebyo.
But it’s really hard now.	Naye ddala kizibu nnyo kati.
That was an idea.	Ekyo kyali kirowoozo.
I probably was at the time too.	Oboolyawo nange mu kiseera ekyo nnali.
This was excellent.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
There is another one.	Waliwo omulala.
Nothing is going to come.	Tewali kigenda kujja.
We are here for one thing.	Tuli wano lwa kintu kimu.
I was ready to do it.	Nnali mwetegefu okukikola.
There is only one problem.	Waliwo ekizibu kimu kyokka.
I love everyone at home.	Njagala nnyo buli muntu awaka.
I love to read.	Njagala nnyo okusoma.
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nkola.
But it is the thing.	Naye kye kintu.
And he does it.	Era akikola.
Where should we go today?	Leero tusaanidde kugenda wa?
There is only this.	Waliwo kino kyokka.
But we are what we are.	Naye ffe kye tuli.
I think that was it.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kyali.
To him, anyway.	Eri ye, mu ngeri yonna.
Nothing.	Tewali.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange asinga.
You can draw whatever you want.	Osobola okukuba ekifaananyi kyonna ky’oyagala.
Now I have nowhere to go.	Kati sirina gye ngenda.
He was asleep.	Yali yeebase.
You have a dog.	Olina embwa.
He had no time to do anything.	Yali talina budde bwa kukola kintu kyonna.
You can’t get much better than that.	Tosobola kufuna bulungi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
In you you go.	Mu ggwe ogenda.
And she would be a good wife.	Era yandibadde mukyala mulungi.
There isn’t too much.	Tewali nnyo nnyo.
He had it.	Yali alina.
This was all true.	Kino kyonna kyali kituufu.
Everyone needs a car today!	Buli muntu yeetaaga mmotoka leero!
Here it is .	Wano we wali .
Like he didn’t want to talk.	Nga bwe yali tayagala kwogera.
But there’s not much we can do.	Naye tewali nnyo kye tusobola kukola.
Or, you know, really early.	Oba, omanyi, ddala nga bukyali.
I was really sick.	Nnali mulwadde ddala.
Not just yet.	Si kyokka n’okutuusa kati.
Now there is a problem.	Kati waliwo obuzibu.
As indeed it may have been.	Nga ddala bwe kiyinza okuba nga bwe kyali.
Now there is no time.	Kati tewali budde.
But a dog is not a person.	Naye embwa si muntu.
He will want to go.	Ajja kwagala okugenda.
He prefers to live in the city.	Asinga kwagala kubeera mu kibuga.
Which .	Nga .
You obviously know better than that.	Kya lwatu nti ggwe omanyi okusinga ekyo.
We go to the movies.	Tugenda mu firimu.
You have to do it now, actually.	Olina okukikola kati, mu butuufu.
The food is excellent.	Emmere nnungi nnyo.
He probably couldn’t.	Oboolyawo yali tasobola.
But it won’t matter.	Naye tekijja kuba kikulu.
I don’t care.	Sifaayo.
I’m sorry for everything.	Nsonyiwa buli kimu.
This was really quite simple.	Kino ddala kyali kyangu nnyo.
That’s a lot of work.	Ekyo mulimu gwa maanyi.
We can’t stay here.	Tetusobola kusigala wano.
But he had been more than that.	Naye yali abadde asinga ekyo.
Then there was no going.	Awo nga tewali kugenda.
This was very easy to do.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo okukola.
I think it’s true.	Ndowooza nti kituufu.
That he could see.	Nti yali asobola okulaba.
But he came up with nothing.	Naye yajja nga talina ky’alina.
We are on the spot.	Tuli ku kifo.
It doesn’t matter here.	Wano si kikulu.
He does this for everyone.	Kino akikola ku buli muntu.
This was very powerful.	Kino kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
It’s hard to say.	Kizibu okwogera.
Not today though.	Si leero wadde.
He knows how to think all the time.	Amanyi okulowooza buli kiseera.
Not everyone does that.	Ekyo si buli muntu nti akikola.
We have to think.	Tulina okulowooza.
In that city.	Mu kibuga ekyo.
However, that is an idea.	Kyokka, ekyo kirowoozo.
I feel better knowing that.	Mpulira bulungi nga mmanyi ekyo.
Now you are a man.	Kati oli musajja.
Not in the way we needed.	Si mu ngeri gye twali twetaaga.
We’ll get everyone on this.	Tujja kufuna buli muntu ku nsonga eno.
I just love it so much.	Nze njagala nnyo kyokka.
He actually spoke for nearly an hour.	Mu butuufu yayogera okumala kumpi essaawa emu.
I am a human being.	Nze ndi muntu.
But that thing .	Naye ekintu ekyo .
He had something to say about it.	Yalina ky’ayagala okwogera ku nsonga eno.
As always, he needed money.	Nga bulijjo, ssente yali yeetaaga.
Now he knew what it was.	Kati yali amanyi kye kyali.
But now we have to work harder.	Naye kati tulina okukola ennyo.
I don’t want to be alone.	Saagala kubeera nzekka.
I work every day.	Nkola buli lunaku.
This was definitely a problem.	Kino mazima ddala kyali kizibu.
No one knows except us.	Tewali amanyi okuggyako ffe.
He has been thinking much the same thing himself.	Ye kennyini abadde alowooza ekintu kye kimu ennyo.
She had a guy with her.	Yalina ggaayi naye.
Maybe too many things.	Mpozzi ebintu bingi nnyo.
I know exactly.	Nze mmanyi bulungi.
However, there may be none.	Kyokka, kiyinza okuba nga tewali.
It’s exactly the same.	Kye kimu ddala.
There is nowhere to go.	Tewali wa kugenda.
Who said what.	Ani yayogera ki.
Or maybe not.	Oba mpozzi nedda.
Or this morning, actually, she thought.	Oba enkya ya leero, mu butuufu, bwe yalowooza.
I don’t really like it.	Sikyagala nnyo.
That will be good.	Ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
And it was the same.	Era bwe kyali.
I knew better.	Nze nnali mmanyi bulungi.
We were going to do it at night.	Twali tugenda kukikola ekiro.
In time tomorrow.	Mu budde enkya.
And it may not have been.	Era kiyinza okuba nga si bwe kyali.
It’s something to behold.	Kintu kya kulaba.
I couldn’t even say anything.	Nnali sisobola kwogera wadde ekintu kyonna.
He has been doing it.	Abadde akikola.
That’s the right thing to do.	Kye kituufu.
Picture.	Ekifaananyi.
This is not normal or true.	Kino si kya bulijjo oba kituufu.
That’s not my point.	Eyo si nsonga yange.
You don’t have to talk until one.	Tolina kwogera okutuusa ku kimu.
He’s going to stay here, too.	Agenda kusigala wano, nange.
You can’t do something.	Tosobola kukola kintu.
That was a bad thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi.
What are you going for.	Ogenda ku ki.
It's not what it is.	Si kye ki...
I will be back early in the morning.	Nja kudda ku makya ennyo.
I guess there is one thing.	Ntebereza nti waliwo ekintu kimu.
Faster, and faster, and faster.	Amangu, era amangu, era amangu.
He couldn’t wait.	Yali tasobola kulinda.
Actually, that’s the whole point.	Mu butuufu, eyo y’ensonga yonna.
I love being me.	Njagala nnyo okubeera nze.
Today is the day.	Leero lwe lunaku.
I'll be back in an hour.	Nja kudda mu ssaawa emu.
This is a practice.	Eno nkola.
I was everything I was.	Nze buli kimu kye nnali.
He really knows how to drive.	Ddala amanyi okuvuga mmotoka.
I knew it would happen.	Nnali nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
But he was a good man.	Naye yali muntu mulungi.
Nothing too bad.	Tewali kibi nnyo.
I didn’t know where he lived at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi gye yali abeera.
This just isn’t the case.	Kino kyokka si bwe kiri.
But now we are together.	Naye kati tuli wamu.
And that seems to be true.	Era ekyo kirabika nga kituufu.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
I think that would be great.	Ndowooza ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I have to go back downstairs.	Nnina okudda wansi.
But there isn’t.	Naye tewali.
She looked that good.	Yali alabika bulungi bw’atyo.
That’s all everyone wants.	Ebyo byonna buli omu ayagala.
I think that’s true.	Ndowooza ekyo kituufu.
It’s nice to see.	Kirungi okulaba.
Or, really, anyone.	Oba, ddala, ani yenna.
I want to be here.	Njagala okuba wano.
He wanted to do everything.	Yali ayagala okukola buli kimu.
I have to talk to him.	Nnina okwogera naye.
But that’s not entirely true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu ddala.
I couldn’t get to do it.	Nnali sisobola kufuna kukikola.
He needed money.	Yali yeetaaga ssente.
It had to be now.	Kyalina okuba nga kati.
And maybe a little bit.	Era mpozzi n’akatono.
That was as it should be.	Ekyo kyali nga bwe kyandibadde.
This is a very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
But there is no such thing.	Naye tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
He told me no.	Yang’amba nti nedda.
The police are here.	Poliisi eri wano.
It was probably hard for everyone.	Oboolyawo kyali kizibu eri buli muntu.
I really wanted this.	Kino nnali njagala nnyo.
He knows it won’t be easy.	Akimanyi nti tekijja kuba kyangu.
Call my office.	Kuba ofiisi yange.
But it’s not good.	Naye si kirungi.
You can be whatever you want to be.	Osobola okubeera kyonna ky’oyagala.
Of course, it wasn’t true at all.	Kya lwatu nti kyali si kituufu n’akatono.
They were just there.	Baali awo kyokka.
I think this is it.	Ndowooza kino kye kiri.
We can’t at all.	Tetusobola n’akatono.
Now here he has no place for himself.	Kati wano talina kifo lwa ye.
All you have to do is.	Kye olina okukola kyokka.
He had no answer.	Yali talina kya kuddamu.
You have to go to the house.	Olina okugenda mu nnyumba.
The house was beautiful.	Ennyumba eyo yali nnungi nnyo.
That is not uncommon.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo.
Only you can do that.	Ekyo ggwe wekka asobola okukikola.
But not here or now.	Naye si wano oba kati.
He worked hard all morning.	Yakola nnyo enkya yonna.
All right, you need to eat well.	Kirungi, olina okulya obulungi.
But that was fine.	Naye ekyo kyali kirungi.
That’s not good for anyone.	Ekyo si kirungi eri omuntu yenna.
We were here.	Twali wano.
It just looks good.	Kirabika bulungi kyokka.
But maybe that was okay.	Naye mpozzi ekyo kyali kirungi.
Perhaps he did too.	Oboolyawo naye yakikola.
And you are the one.	Era ggwe oli.
Everyone has to work out of that.	Buli muntu alina okukola okuva mu ekyo.
He was a strong man.	Yali musajja wa maanyi.
But, you know?	Naye, okimanyi?
The guy didn’t know his job.	Ggaayi oyo yali tamanyi mulimu gwe.
He loved to swim.	Yali ayagala nnyo okuwuga.
Every time actually.	Buli kiseera mu butuufu.
This was one for me.	Eno yali emu gyendi.
I don’t know why, myself.	Simanyi lwaki, nze kennyini.
He was always in a hurry.	Bulijjo yali mu bwangu.
Very good indeed .	Kirungi nnyo ddala .
I'm pretty sure this is it.	Nkakasa bulungi nti kino kye kiri.
It was a huge risk.	Kyali kya bulabe bwa maanyi nnyo.
You are not a doctor.	Ggwe toli musawo.
No one could already be there then.	Tewali yali asobola kubeerawo dda mu kiseera ekyo.
I thought you were at work.	Nalowooza nti oli ku mulimu.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
I have a thing for someone else.	Nnina ekintu ku muntu omulala.
Why does everyone talk so fast?	Lwaki buli muntu ayogera mangu nnyo?
But he's probably at work right now.	Naye osanga ali ku mulimu mu kiseera kino.
He has been very good to me.	Abadde mulungi nnyo gyendi.
You probably will too.	Oboolyawo naawe ojja kukikola.
That's what you want.	Ekyo kyoyagala.
At this hour he cannot eat.	Ku ssaawa eno tasobola kulya.
There is no time for love.	Tewali budde bwa kwagala.
It’s a little better now.	Kirungi katono kati.
But it won’t be too bad for you.	Naye tekijja kuba kibi nnyo gy’oli.
It was a wonderful time.	Kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo.
It was a really beautiful place.	Ddala kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
He is not very happy.	Si musanyufu nnyo.
That’s not what I want.	Ekyo si kye njagala.
He’s going to go to school.	Agenda kugenda ku ssomero.
And this is why he was unlucky.	Era eno y’ensonga lwaki yali talina mukisa.
Now he could think.	Kati yali asobola okulowooza.
This is what it is! 	Kino kye kiri!
You want to live in that house.	Oyagala kubeera mu nnyumba eyo.
That’s all you.	Ebyo byonna ggwe.
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
We can’t say anything.	Tetusobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
It’s a good idea, actually.	Kirowoozo kirungi, mu butuufu.
I have no problem with him.	Sirina buzibu naye.
But he was harmless.	Naye yali talina bulabe.
She wanted him too.	Yali ayagala naye naye.
He's a really nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi ddala.
I want to buy a house.	Njagala okugula ennyumba.
There is no such opportunity.	Tewali mukisa nga guno.
Something like this and this.	Ekintu nga kino ne kino.
I don’t like that.	Ekyo sikyagala.
I have something to do.	Nnina kye nnina okukola.
But not too many.	Naye si bingi nnyo.
I can easily leave my house.	Nsobola bulungi okuva mu nnyumba yange.
And and and.	Era ne ne.
You certainly shouldn’t do that.	Mazima ddala ekyo tolina kukikola.
Either way, we’re here to help as always.	Mu ngeri yonna, tuli wano okuyamba nga bulijjo.
I should just do it.	Nze nsaanidde kumala kukikola.
He is a man.	Ye musajja.
You have to go.	Olina okugenda.
One.	Emu.
But we have to get out of here.	Naye tulina okuva wano.
I have to get out of here.	Nnina okuva wano.
He has no knowledge at all.	Talina kumanya n’akatono.
He should have had it that way.	Yandibadde alina bw’atyo.
I don’t have time.	Sirina budde.
In fact it is the same.	Mu butuufu kye kimu.
But, now.	Naye, kati.
Of course, this is not entirely true.	Kya lwatu nti kino si kituufu ddala.
No one is in sight.	Tewali muntu yenna alabika.
He had hope, anyway.	Yalina essuubi, mu ngeri yonna.
Now it could be anyone.	Kati kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
Clearly, there is a way around this.	Kya lwatu nti waliwo engeri y’okukola ku nsonga eno.
No, he was making one for himself.	Nedda, yali akola emu ku ye.
I wanted to.	Nnali njagala.
There is good in all of that.	Ebyo byonna mulimu obulungi.
But that’s not entirely true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu ddala.
I want to have time to get to the answer.	Njagala okufuna obudde okutuuka ku kuddamu.
But he did it.	Naye ye yakikola.
I’m sick of you.	Nze ndi mulwadde ku ggwe.
I do read about him.	Nze nkola okusoma ku ye.
But he did his job.	Naye yakola omulimu gwe.
He said it was good.	Yagambye nti kirungi.
But you know .	Naye omanyi .
I need to be like everyone else.	Nze nneetaaga okubeera nga buli muntu omulala.
But you won’t do it.	Naye tojja kukikola.
It’s best to stay a little earlier.	Kirungi okumala akaseera katono nga bukyali.
He was truly a good man.	Mazima ddala yali musajja mulungi.
And he didn’t know you knew it.	Era yali tamanyi nti ggwe okimanyi.
I have to say.	Nnina okugamba.
But he couldn't say that.	Naye ekyo yali tasobola kwogera.
He is not happy.	Si musanyufu.
Common.	Kya bulijjo.
What are we supposed to do with this?	Kino tulina kukola ki?
And that would be saying something.	Era ekyo kyandibadde okwogera ekintu.
But today no one lives like that.	Naye leero tewali muntu yenna abeera bw’atyo.
However, I want to say this.	Kyokka, kino njagala okwogera.
That’s not quite true.	Ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
This is very unusual.	Kino si kya bulijjo nnyo.
Very happy to be here.	Musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano.
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
Even now, he didn't know why.	Ne kati, yali tamanyi nsonga lwaki.
There is only one problem.	Waliwo ekizibu kimu kyokka.
This is not a good idea.	Kino si kirowoozo kirungi.
It's there.	Kiri awo.
It was really hard to watch this.	Ddala kyali kizibu okulaba kino.
I have a lot of money.	Nnina ssente nnyingi.
He is beautiful.	Ye mulungi.
That’s what you want.	Ekyo ky’oyagala.
In the same room though.	Mu kisenge kye kimu wadde.
Although for the most part they are.	Wadde nga okusinga bwe bali.
And he had no answer.	Era yali talina kya kuddamu.
Not bad, just not very good.	Si kibi, kyokka si kirungi nnyo.
That’s all we can do.	Ekyo kyokka kye tusobola okukola.
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
That he shouldn’t talk to anyone like that.	Nti tasaanidde kwogera na muntu yenna bw’atyo.
I don’t like that idea at all.	Sifaayo n’akatono ku ndowooza eyo.
You don’t even have to talk to him.	Tolina na kwogera naye.
He might be really good.	Ayinza okuba nga ddala mulungi.
Everything would be fine.	Buli kimu kyandibadde kirungi.
He didn’t have time.	Yali talina budde.
But no one knew how to do anything about it.	Naye tewali yali amanyi kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
It was time to go.	Kyali kiseera kya kugenda.
He was fine, apparently.	Yali bulungi, kirabika.
But that doesn’t matter at all.	Naye ekyo si kikulu n’akatono.
No one told me that like you.	Tewali yang’amba ekyo nga ggwe.
Maybe he’s sick.	Mpozzi nga mulwadde.
He wants the weekend at home.	Ayagala wiikendi awaka.
We have a job to do.	Tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
He went there.	Yagenda eyo.
We have, and we are here.	Tulina, era tuli wano.
I know what my brother did.	Mmanyi muganda wange kye yakola.
He was happy to go.	Yali musanyufu okugenda.
There really isn’t much we can do.	Mu butuufu tewali bingi bye tusobola kukola.
He is.	Ali.
You’re going to be here now.	Ogenda kubeera wano kati.
So he said a lot.	Bwatyo bwe yayogera bingi.
I am very happy about it.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
He does it well.	Akikola bulungi.
He began to speak.	Yatandika okwogera.
That night.	Ekiro ekyo.
Anyone else think this is a bad idea?.	Waliwo omulala yenna alowooza nti kino kirowoozo kibi?.
He’s going to be here tomorrow.	Agenda kubeera wano enkya.
You really can do it.	Ddala osobola okukikola.
And it was so easy.	Era nga kyangu nnyo.
He looked beautiful.	Yalabika nga mulungi.
This is simply not true.	Kino si kituufu kyokka.
Now he was very interested.	Kati yali ayagala nnyo.
I'm the one.	Nze nze.
No one was in sight.	Tewali yali alabika.
That’s what we needed.	Ekyo twali twetaaga.
He was willing.	Yali ayagala.
However, I don’t know what they are.	Kyokka simanyi kye bali.
On that you are.	Ku ekyo ggwe oli.
He didn't know what to say.	Yali tamanyi kya kwogera.
That arrangement is unusual.	Enteekateeka eyo si ya bulijjo.
I’m in the office every day.	Nze ndi mu ofiisi buli lunaku.
I have been thinking about this.	Kino mbadde ndowooza ku nsonga eno.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
You look good too.	Naawe olabika bulungi.
That’s just not true.	Ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
I love that book.	Njagala nnyo ekitabo ekyo.
Are you sure you want to do that?	Okakasa nti ekyo oyagala okukikola?
Not even though he is.	Si wadde nga ye.
We have to dwell on him.	Tulina okubeera ku ye.
At this point he would be with her.	Mu kiseera kino yandibadde naye.
And it’s not my wedding.	Era si mbaga yange.
He didn't know what it was.	Yali tamanyi kiki.
I really wanted to go with him.	Nnali njagala nnyo okugenda naye.
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
He expected it to happen.	Yali asuubira nti kijja kubaawo.
Anyone could do this.	Kino omuntu yenna yali asobola okukikola.
It won’t be a problem.	Tekijja kuba kizibu.
I really don’t want to know.	Mazima ddala saagala kumanya.
Who was there.	Ani yali awo.
I want to talk to him.	Njagala kwogera naye.
We have to do the work.	Tulina okukola omulimu.
I said now.	Nagamba kati.
He didn’t know why he would do such a thing.	Yali tamanyi lwaki yandikoze ekintu ng’ekyo.
At the time he was very ill.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali mulwadde nnyo.
That will help.	Ekyo kijja kuyamba.
That was a good thing.	Ekyo kyali kirungi.
He has to be at home.	Alina okuba awaka.
On the bottom.	Ku wansi.
He is such a good man.	Musajja mulungi bwatyo.
How much money do you have?	Olina ssente mmeka?
It really doesn’t matter.	Mazima ddala si kikulu.
Like he said, that wasn’t him.	Nga bwe yagamba, ekyo si kye yali.
But we have to go.	Naye tulina okugenda.
Now he knew why.	Kati yali amanyi lwaki.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
Who knows, you might get lucky soon.	Ani amanyi, oyinza okufuna omukisa mu bbanga ttono.
It’s going to be something.	Kigenda kuba kintu.
But he already knew.	Naye yali amanyi dda.
But he still couldn’t do it.	Naye nga n’okutuusa kati yali tasobola kukikola.
That was probably a good thing.	Ekyo osanga kyali kirungi.
And in fact, this was true of him, too.	Era mu butuufu, kino kyali kituufu ku ye, naye.
It may be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
He said he would come tomorrow.	Yagambye nti ajja kujja enkya.
I think we’ll both get what we need.	Ndowooza ffembi tujja kufuna bye twetaaga.
That’s what I think.	Kye ndowooza.
He needs to step back, get perspective.	Yeetaaga okudda emabega, okufuna endowooza.
I’m a movie guy, myself.	Nze ndi musajja wa firimu, nze kennyini.
To my son.	Eri mwana wange.
You know what he is.	Omanyi ky’ali.
He was a very nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo.
Maybe now.	Mpozzi kati.
I want to be a guy.	Njagala kubeera ggaayi.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
And it was for good reason.	Era kyali lwa nsonga nnungi.
There is no way this could be happening.	Tewali ngeri kino gye kiyinza kuba nga kigenda mu maaso.
You don’t have to do that.	Ekyo tolina kukikola.
He said he wanted to talk.	Yagambye nti ayagala kwogera.
No, that was a bad idea.	Nedda, ekyo kyali kirowoozo kibi.
He can do anything.	Ayinza okukola ekintu kyonna.
Not as good as usual.	Si mulungi nga bulijjo.
But he didn't really want to talk to anyone.	Naye yali tayagala nnyo kwogera na muntu yenna.
I have been feeling good.	Mbadde mpulira bulungi.
You know what that would be like.	Omanyi ekyo bwe kyandibadde.
I don't think he knows though.	Sirowooza nti amanyi wadde.
Everyone is talking about it.	Buli omu ayogera ku nsonga eyo.
That was the reason why.	Eyo ye yali ensonga lwaki.
He's got something.	Alina ky'alina.
I didn’t really know who he really was.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi ani ddala.
You probably know about me.	Oboolyawo omanyi ku nze.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
You can’t be a doctor.	Tosobola kuba musawo.
But it seems more than that to me.	Naye kirabika okusinga ekyo gyendi.
He wasn’t going to come.	Yali tagenda kujja.
I know it will happen.	Nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
For anyone.	Ku muntu yenna.
. . . .	.
But there is nothing.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna.
I loved it in school.	Nnali njagala nnyo mu ssomero.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
He thought he was going to do it.	Yalowooza nti agenda kukikola.
It’s great to work with him.	Kikulu nnyo okukola naye.
And he actually looks great.	Era mu butuufu alabika bulungi nnyo.
He was the one.	Ye yali omu.
I think that’s a good thing.	Ndowooza ekyo kirungi.
That’s what I was doing.	Ekyo nnali nkola.
Do not go from house to house.	Togenda nnyumba ku nnyumba.
And making a lot of money in the process.	Era okukola ssente nnyingi mu nkola eno.
We need to help.	Twetaaga okuyamba.
Here you go!.	Wano ogenda!.
Almost the same.	Kumpi kye kimu.
He thinks he is powerless.	Alowooza nti talina maanyi.
We’re not the only ones.	Si ffe ffekka.
It seems a little complicated to me.	Kirabika nga kizibu katono gyendi.
I didn’t want to go.	Nnali saagala kugenda.
I need money urgently.	Nze nneetaaga ssente mu bwangu.
He had no plans now.	Yali talina nteekateeka yonna kati.
Really good work.	Ddala omulimu mulungi.
My friend was with me.	Mukwano gwange yali nange.
It was awful that night.	Kyali kibi nnyo ekiro ekyo.
This is a good one.	Eno nnungi.
There is no problem with this.	Tewali buzibu bwonna ku kino.
It was a beautiful late afternoon.	Yali nnungi nnyo akawungeezi akawungeezi.
Being willing to do almost anything is a good idea.	Okubeera mwetegefu okukola kumpi ekintu kyonna kirowoozo kirungi.
I really have no way to tell.	Mazima ddala sirina ngeri gye nnyinza kubuulira.
I am not a human being.	Siri muntu.
He was ready to go.	Yali mwetegefu okugenda.
It doesn’t matter, I suppose.	Si nsonga, ndowooza.
I needed to talk to him.	Nnali nneetaaga okwogera naye.
He would definitely do.	Yandikoze ddala.
This was excellent.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
Now we either move on, or else.	Kati oba tugenda mu maaso, oba si ekyo.
He was a good kid.	Yali mwana mulungi.
As we are.	Nga bwe tuli.
But we will talk.	Naye tujja kwogera.
He still didn’t know.	Yali n’okutuusa kati yali tamanyi.
The food is excellent.	Emmere nnungi nnyo.
In the congregation.	Mu kibiina.
Why is this the case.	Lwaki kino bwe kiri.
I only have you.	Nze nnina ggwe wekka.
Maybe not,’ she said.	Mpozzi si bwe kiri,’ bwe yagamba.
It’s not just here.	Si wano kyokka.
I will never do such a thing.	Sijja kukola kintu ng’ekyo.
I’m doing pretty well.	Nkola bulungi nnyo.
No one is going to be with me.	Tewali kugenda kubeera nange.
I don’t want to be with you anymore.	Saagala kuddamu kubeera naawe.
We will all be there.	Ffenna tujja kubeerawo.
You can do no wrong.	Tosobola kukola kibi kyonna.
I hope he does.	Nsuubira nti akola bw’atyo.
You can’t live there now.	Tosobola kubeera eyo kati.
But it was something to do.	Naye kyali kintu kya kukola.
And it would be awful.	Era kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
I knew it was him.	Namanya nti ye ye.
Don’t move on that fast.	Ekyo togenda mu maaso mangu.
I could have been anyone.	Nnali nsobola okuba omuntu yenna.
That’s about then.	Ekyo kiri kumpi mu kiseera ekyo.
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza.
And you have it, too.	Era naawe olina.
Someone is speaking.	Waliwo ayogera.
It will be great in my classroom.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo mu kibiina kyange.
You are beautiful.	Oli mulungi.
There is nothing to do about it.	Tewali kya kukola ku nsonga eyo.
But he knows it.	Naye akimanyi.
I have three dogs.	Nnina embwa ssatu.
Will continue to work on this.	Ajja kusigala ng’akola ku nsonga eno.
You can’t see this.	Tosobola kulaba kino.
Nothing, as far as he could see.	Tewali kintu kyonna, nga bwe yali asobola okulaba.
He knew now what was going to happen.	Yali amanyi kati ekigenda okubaawo.
My wife did everything.	Mukyala wange yakola buli kimu.
I have to buy one.	Nnina okugula emu.
I wanted this.	Kino nnali njagala.
He is the reason for all of this.	Ye nsonga ya bino byonna.
Are you sick?	Oli mulwadde?
Who had it.	Ani yalina.
Which is very difficult.	Ekintu ekizibu ennyo.
We are working it out as we go along.	Tuli mu kukikola nga bwe tugenda.
Here, let me.	Wano, ka nze.
Is this true?.	Kino kituufu?.
It’s not going anywhere.	Tewali we kigenda.
He agreed to go.	Yakkiriza okugenda.
But it is the thing.	Naye kye kintu.
He was in school at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali mu ssomero.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si ekyo kyokka.
That’s all I want.	Ebyo byonna bye njagala.
But he's also a playboy.	Naye naye muzannyi wa kuzannya.
Who was he? 	Yali ani?
This will be very helpful.	Kino kijja kuyamba nnyo.
One of us had to go.	Omu ku ffe yalina okugenda.
Where are you.	Oli wa.
You can do that here.	Ekyo osobola okukikola wano.
It’s really true.	Ddala kituufu.
He said it was good.	Yagambye nti kirungi.
It’s coming closer.	Kijja kumpi.
You have to move on.	Olina okugenda mu maaso.
It's the same as he was.	Kye kimu nga bwe yali.
I love the energy.	Njagala nnyo amaanyi.
I will never do this to my child.	Kino sijja kukikola ku mwana wange.
This is too close to work.	Kino kumpi nnyo okukola.
But not to me.	Naye si gyendi.
Probably not anything.	Oboolyawo si kintu kyonna.
It was a normal thing.	Kyali kintu kya bulijjo.
I can’t do it.	Nze sisobola kukikola.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
It’s hard to get money.	Kizibu okufuna ssente.
I was just glad we were friends.	Nali musanyufu kyokka nti twali ba mukwano.
That’s what he wanted.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala.
I said you really don’t have an issue with me.	Nagamba nti ddala tolina nsonga gyendi.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
I was busy.	Nnali bbize.
Everyone does.	Buli muntu akola.
Real.	Ddala.
It is not to belong to anyone.	Si kya kubeera kya muntu yenna.
I don't know.	Simanyi.
I have a lot of money.	Nnina ssente nnyingi.
He was talking to me.	Yali ayogera nange.
I'll talk to him.	Nja kwogera naye.
I don’t think he’ll be back until tomorrow.	Sirowooza nti ajja kudda okutuusa enkya.
No, it’s not that.	Nedda, si ekyo.
Maybe that’s why it’s so difficult.	Mpozzi eyo y’ensonga lwaki kizibu nnyo.
You can’t wait.	Tosobola kulinda.
But that's not the issue now.	Naye eyo si y'ensonga kati.
I really didn’t know what to do.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kukola.
This is a very common problem.	Kino kizibu kya bulijjo nnyo.
You have to do everything.	Olina okukola buli kimu.
I know how to do it.	Nze mmanyi okukikola.
I’m not going to work.	Nze sigenda kukola.
Not that it really matters.	Si nti kikulu nnyo.
No, that is not the case.	Nedda, ekyo si bwe kiri.
He was going to work.	Yali agenda ku mulimu.
You have to work with me.	Olina okukola nange.
I will admit that much.	Nja kukkiriza bingi ebyo.
It’s good for them.	Kirungi gye bali.
There is almost nothing we can do.	Kumpi tewali kye tusobola kukola.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
He seems to have a problem.	Alabika alina obuzibu.
The picture is correct.	Ekifaananyi kituufu.
What you thought it was.	Kye wali olowooza nti.
Is he talking about me? 	Ayogera ku nze?
I have a lot of it.	Nnina bingi.
He tried everything he could.	Yagezaako buli kimu kye yali asobola.
I couldn’t do anything right.	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna kituufu.
I think he's happy.	Ndowooza musanyufu.
It was going to be close.	Kyali kigenda kuba kumpi.
And everything is going to be fine.	Era buli kimu kigenda kuba kirungi.
It doesn’t matter now.	Si kikulu kati.
That may be true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
You have been a good patient.	Obadde mulwadde mulungi.
You don’t have much time.	Tolina budde bungi.
It would be so easy to get away from that idea.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo okuva ku ndowooza eyo.
It’s my opinion.	Kye ndowooza yange.
I’m in one right now.	Nze ndi mu kimu mu kiseera kino.
That’s certainly the case here.	Ekyo mazima ddala bwe kiri wano.
It’s a good thing.	Kintu kirungi.
And of course he came.	Era ddala yajja.
There is no reason for that.	Tewali nsonga yonna ku ekyo.
But of course.	Naye ddala.
He wasn’t coming.	Yali tajja.
It's not you.	Si ggwe.
That's what he has.	Ekyo ky'alina.
This is very powerful for me.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo gyendi.
He must have been very happy that night.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali musanyufu nnyo ekiro ekyo.
That’s the issue here.	Eyo y’ensonga eri wano.
There is nothing for me here.	Tewali kintu kyonna gyendi wano.
But there is no luck.	Naye tewali mukisa.
That’s not exactly a bad thing.	Ekyo si kintu kibi ddala.
He needed time to himself to think.	Yali yeetaaga obudde eri ye kennyini okulowooza.
He's nowhere in a hurry.	Talina w'ali mu bwangu.
It really is as simple as that.	Ddala kyangu nga ekyo.
But he really did.	Naye ddala yakikola.
He could hardly believe it.	Yali tasobola bulungi kukkiriza.
Me too.	Nange.
I'm fine with that.	Ekyo ndi bulungi.
He is still a young player.	Akyali muzannyi muto.
He wants to talk.	Ayagala kwogera.
He prefers to be alone.	Asinga kwagala kubeera yekka.
Actually, not at any time.	Mu butuufu, si ku ssaawa yonna.
I have a lot of it.	Nnina bingi.
I don’t want to go.	Saagala kugenda.
I love it so much.	Nze ayagala nnyo.
You’ll be home soon.	Ojja kudda eka mu bbanga ttono.
My son.	Mwana wange.
I think of that.	Nze ndowooza ekyo.
He could have gone.	Yali asobola okugenda.
But this will be fine.	Naye kino kijja kuba kirungi.
And very unrealistic at the same time.	Era nga si kya ddala nnyo mu kiseera kye kimu.
But.	Naye.
I love doing that, actually.	Njagala nnyo okukola ekyo, mu butuufu.
You are my good friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange omulungi.
He thought we were friends.	Yalowooza nti tuli ba mukwano.
We’re fine.	Tuli bulungi.
He does, and there certainly is.	Akola, era mazima ddala waliwo.
No one on.	Tewali muntu yenna ku.
If he did.	Singa yakikola.
You have no idea what it is .	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki kye .
But my, how beautiful you look.	Naye wange, nga olabika bulungi.
He says he won’t.	Agamba nti tajja kukikola.
That's your point!.	Eyo y'ensonga yo!.
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
There is no one there.	Tewali muntu yenna awo.
Probably not always.	Oboolyawo si bulijjo.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
I’ve always got it.	Nze bulijjo nfunye.
You are not happy, you think you are.	Toli musanyufu, olowooza nti oli musanyufu.
I have to do this.	Kino nnina okukikola.
I was ready.	Nnali mwetegefu.
You’ll be home soon.	Ojja kudda awaka mu bbanga ttono.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
We have a job to do.	Tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
I wish he wouldn’t.	Njagala tajja kukikola.
He had something to say to me.	Yalina kye yang’amba.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si ekyo kyokka.
He is very busy.	Ali bbize nnyo.
No, it wasn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kyali.
I don’t want to talk about this.	Kino saagala kwogera ku nsonga eno.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
I know you are.	Nkimanyi nti oli.
No time for anything but work.	Tewali budde bwa kintu kyonna okuggyako okukola.
How bad it is for them.	Nga kibi nnyo gye bali.
You can see why.	Oyinza okulaba ensonga lwaki.
And that is very important.	Era ekyo kikulu nnyo.
Not, of course, that it matters, he thought.	Si, kya lwatu, nti kikulu, bwe yalowooza.
Here, we don’t have a strong police force.	Wano, tetulina poliisi ya maanyi.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
And you do it.	Era ggwe okola.
But maybe not.	Naye mpozzi nedda.
Everything is right.	Buli kimu kituufu.
That’s a policy issue.	Eyo nsonga ya nkola.
You have to see this.	Kino olina okulaba.
From the process to the whole.	Okuva ku nkola okutuuka ku kintu kyonna.
This is basically what it is.	Kino okusinga kye kiri.
We have the money to do it.	Tulina ssente okukikola.
Really, really fast.	Ddala, ddala amangu.
Of course, he knew this.	Kya lwatu nti kino yali akimanyi.
He was really one of us.	Ddala yali omu ku ffe.
But no one knew what to do about it.	Naye tewali yali amanyi kya kukikola.
I think he will do it again.	Ndowooza ajja kuddamu okukikola.
Whatever is going on.	Kyonna ekigenda mu maaso.
It’s much more complicated than that.	Kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I didn’t have time to do it.	Nnali sirina budde kukikola.
He is the only man.	Ye musajja yekka.
I have experienced the same.	Nze nfunye kye kimu.
I said he could go.	Nagamba nti asobola okugenda.
There it is!	Eyo gye kiri!
This was going to be harder than he thought.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kizibu okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
We will do everything as one.	Buli kimu tujja kukikola nga kimu.
Indeed, they were.	Mazima ddala, baali.
The same thing is happening today.	Ekintu kye kimu kigenda mu maaso leero.
For a long time.	Okumala ebbanga ddene.
But, not really.	Naye, si ddala.
I knew what he wanted.	Nnali mmanyi kye yali ayagala.
With anyone he couldn’t go.	Nga waliwo omuntu yenna yali tasobola kugenda.
The dog was sick.	Embwa yali mulwadde.
But he was very good.	Naye yali mulungi nnyo.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
That is the only truth.	Ekyo kye kituufu kyokka.
That’s what he told me.	Ekyo yang’amba.
No, it’s worse than that.	Nedda, kibi okusinga ekyo.
This is us.	Ffe oyo.
But this is very important.	Naye kino kikulu nnyo.
I have to talk to him.	Nnina okwogera naye.
I want your opinion on that.	Njagala endowooza yo ku ekyo.
But then there.	Naye awo awo.
I love dogs.	Njagala nnyo embwa.
I think everyone knows that.	Ndowooza ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
Good job though.	Omulimu mulungi wadde.
Anything, while good for work, is very difficult.	Ekintu kyonna wadde nga kirungi ku mulimu, kizibu nnyo.
But that’s a good thing.	Naye ekyo kintu kirungi.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
We were very close friends.	Twali ba mukwano nnyo.
He knew why he didn't.	Yali amanyi ensonga lwaki yali tamanyi.
Not very well.	Si bulungi nnyo.
Or whatever it is.	Oba kyonna kye kiri.
The clock is really you.	Essaawa ddala ggwe.
It’s the same thing.	Kye kimu.
I could do that.	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola.
However, it is not good.	Kyokka, si kirungi.
But he always knew.	Naye bulijjo yali akimanyi.
I don’t even know what that was.	Ekyo simanyi na kye kyali.
Maybe you should.	Mpozzi nga wandibadde okola.
Maybe she will know.	Mpozzi ajja kumanya.
Now, he knew it.	Kati, yali akimanyi.
And not everyone has those things.	Era si buli muntu nti alina ebintu ebyo.
And we have to win.	Era tulina okuwangula.
It’s not a good thing.	Si kintu kirungi.
I’m just glad you’re okay.	Nze ndi musanyufu kyokka nti oli bulungi.
And that’s just true.	Era ekyo kituufu kyokka.
He wasn’t like that at all.	Yali si bw’atyo n’akatono.
It’s everywhere, and it’s more important than anything.	Kiri buli wamu, era kikulu okusinga ekintu kyonna.
He is a doctor.	Ye musawo.
You are.	Oli.
You are sick, he said.	Oli mulwadde, bwe yagamba.
He knows and he doesn’t.	Amanyi era naye tamanyi.
I feel normal.	Mpulira nga ndi wa bulijjo.
And she is a very loving wife.	Era mukyala ayagala nnyo.
I wish it wasn’t.	Njagala nga si bwe kiri.
He has to hit well.	Alina okukuba obulungi.
I will eat anything.	Nja kulya ekintu kyonna.
I had found it.	Nze nali nfunye.
You want, you want, you want!.	Oyagala, oyagala, oyagala!.
I’m really working hard.	Nze ddala nkola nnyo.
It wasn't her favorite room.	Si kye kyali kisenge kye yali ayagala ennyo.
He was happy	Yali musanyufu
Maybe he really does know.	Mpozzi ddala akimanyi.
It would be easier in so many ways.	Kyandibadde kyangu mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo.
Where we need to go.	Gye twetaaga okugenda.
We’ll see something like this.	Tujja kulaba ekintu nga kino.
In fact, perhaps you can help too.	Mu butuufu, oboolyawo naawe oyinza okuyamba.
No one loves their job more.	Tewali muntu yenna asinga kwagala mulimu gwe.
All by myself.	Byonna nga ndi nzekka.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
. . . .	.
So he will do that today.	Bwatyo ajja kukola ekyo leero.
All that I want.	Byonna bye njagala.
It was a bad, bad place.	Kyali kifo kibi, kibi.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
But it’s my friend.	Naye mukwano gwange.
Not on this one.	Si ku kino.
Everyone here knows it.	Buli muntu wano akimanyi.
You have to.	Olina nga.
You want to know.	Oyagala okumanya.
In a way it is very important.	Mu ngeri emu kikulu nnyo.
But it wasn’t like that.	Naye nga si bwe yali.
I don’t have the money.	Nze sirina ssente.
In fact, it is a serious problem.	Mu butuufu, kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
The problem is, no one really knows what he wants.	Obuzibu buli nti, mu butuufu tewali amanyi ky’ayagala.
This was very important to me.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo gyendi.
Common.	Kya bulijjo.
You are a man of the house.	Oli musajja wa nnyumba.
Someone knew why, of course.	Omuntu yali amanyi lwaki, ddala.
It was him.	Yali ye.
That’s easy.	Ekyo kyangu.
You should read this book.	Olina okusoma ekitabo kino.
I am an only child and I don’t have one friend.	Ndi mwana omu era sirina mukwano gwange omu.
I will definitely do it again.	Mazima ddala nja kuddamu okukikola.
I couldn’t do anything.	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
In fact, he was working hard.	Mu butuufu, yali akola nnyo.
I know you have to.	Nkimanyi nti olina.
What can one say about that.	Omuntu ayinza kwogera ki ku ekyo.
He certainly would be.	Mazima ddala yandibadde bw’atyo.
There is no way.	Tewali ngeri yonna.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
He is a very nice man.	Musajja mulungi nnyo.
I think that was very important.	Ndowooza ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
When do you want this?	Kino oyagala ddi?
From his friends.	Okuva mu mikwano gye.
Apparently he is sick.	Kirabika mulwadde.
I’m not a father.	Nze siri taata.
That's my point.	Eyo y'ensonga yange.
Why he did so, now no one knows.	Lwaki yakola bw’atyo, kati tewali amanyi.
Or whatever it is.	Oba kyonna kye kiri.
But easier said than done.	Naye kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
Can we go for a drive?	Tusobola okugenda okuvuga mmotoka?
I’m not really a city person.	Mu butuufu siri muntu wa kibuga.
He felt he could say anything.	Yawulira nti yali asobola okwogera ekintu kyonna.
Where was he.	Gye yali wa.
You probably know that.	Ekyo oboolyawo okimanyi.
Nothing of the sort.	Tewali kintu kyonna kya ngeri eyo.
It was on my own.	Kyali ku kyange.
You’ll see.	Ojja kulaba.
It was him.	Yali ye.
In the meantime however.	Mu kiseera kino naye.
I won’t even try.	Sijja na kugezaako.
For you, this book is very important.	Ggwe ekitabo kino kikulu nnyo.
As he would have with her.	Nga bwe yandibadde naye.
I was feeling good already.	Nali mpulira bulungi dda.
Please, just no.	Nsaba, nedda kyokka.
ME '.	NZE '.
I want it now.	Njagala kati.
I am very happy to say that now, we are.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okugamba nti kati, tuli.
I don’t want to stay indoors.	Saagala kusigala mu nnyumba.
My friend.	Mukwano gwange.
And no one knows why.	Era tewali amanyi lwaki.
That’s how it was supposed to be.	Bwatyo bwe kyalina okuba.
He wanted to be with her tonight.	Yali ayagala kubeera naye ekiro kino.
But that was .	Naye ekyo kyali .
I love everybody.	Njagala nnyo buli muntu.
I was a very good doctor.	Nnali musawo mulungi nnyo.
We have no idea.	Tetulina kirowoozo kyonna.
Or he may go to the hospital.	Oba ayinza okugenda mu ddwaaliro.
It looks great in any case.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo mu mbeera yonna.
There was no way he couldn’t.	Tewali ngeri gye yali tasobola.
No return as yet.	Tewali kuddamu kudda nga okutuuka kati.
Someone really has to do it.	Omuntu ddala alina okukikola.
I think he is very good at his job.	Ndowooza mulungi nnyo mu mulimu gwe.
But it’s not good.	Naye si kirungi.
That’s my son talking.	Oyo mwana wange ayogera.
I know he isn’t.	Nkimanyi nti si bw’atyo.
Of everyone and no one, of everything and nothing.	Wa buli muntu era tewali muntu yenna, wa buli kimu era nga tewali.
That’s how it can happen.	Bwatyo bwe kiyinza okubaawo.
I didn’t know you could do this.	Nze nali simanyi nti kino osobola okukikola.
And eating does.	Era okulya akola.
I don't want to.	Saagala.
Actually, you’re fine.	Mu butuufu, oli bulungi.
He is not a good person.	Si muntu mulungi.
But now, no.	Naye kati, nedda.
I am nothing.	Nze si kintu kyonna.
But just a little bit.	Naye katono ddala.
It’s simple, he said.	Kyangu, bwe yagambye.
I can’t talk for very long.	Sisobola kwogera bbanga ddene nnyo.
No, it was definitely him.	Nedda, mazima ddala ye yali ye.
It is very good for us.	Kirungi nnyo gye tuli.
There is no reason.	Tewali nsonga yonna.
We all have to work hard.	Ffenna tulina okukola ennyo.
He's just an idea now.	Ye kirowoozo kyokka kati.
And he didn’t know why.	Era yali tamanyi lwaki.
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
I can't even.	Sisobola wadde.
Can you help?.	Osobola okuyamba?.
This would be nice.	Kino kyandibadde kirungi.
I’m the one he needs.	Nze gwe yeetaaga.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
You can do it yourself.	Osobola okukola wekka.
But it was the same everywhere.	Naye buli wamu kyali kye kimu.
You can definitely do it too.	Naawe osobola okukikola ddala.
Now the point is that it is always true.	Kati ensonga eri nti bulijjo kituufu.
Are you with me?.	Oli nange?.
I don’t want to talk to you.	Saagala kwogera naawe.
You're not well.	Toli bulungi.
I have to act fast.	Nnina okukola amangu.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
I was afraid of what was going to happen.	Nnali ntya ekigenda okubaawo.
But it was also in him.	Naye era kyali mu ye.
He went home.	Yagenda awaka.
He was behind me.	Yali emabega wange.
I’m not sure if that’s good or bad.	Sikakasa oba ekyo kirungi oba kibi.
Now is not the time though.	Kati si kye kiseera wadde.
He knew what he was planning.	Yali amanyi kye yali ateekateeka.
It’s completely up to you.	Kiri gy’oli ddala.
I was a little nervous too.	Nange nnali ntya katono.
He thought it wasn’t.	Yalowooza nti si bwe kiri.
You don’t have to go alone.	Tolina kugenda wekka.
Like, everybody knows that.	Nga, buli muntu ekyo akimanyi.
Not easy, of course.	Si kyangu, ddala.
There is not enough knowledge.	Tewali kumanya kumala.
He was still in jail.	Yali akyali mu kkomera.
I really don’t know how to go about this.	Mu butuufu simanyi ngeri ya kugenda mu kino.
Not with me, of course.	Si nange, ddala.
I’m in trouble here.	Nze wano ndi mu buzibu.
He was a man of faith.	Yali musajja wa kukkiriza.
For each of us.	Ku buli omu ku ffe.
It’s hard to get to that point.	Kizibu okutuuka ku nsonga eyo.
Hard work was what he needed now.	Okukola ennyo kye yali yeetaaga kati.
The point is, you don’t really want to do this.	Ensonga eri nti, kino mu butuufu toyagala kukikola.
You know you want one.	Omanyi nti oyagala emu.
Things like	Ebintu nga .
You can get here.	Osobola okutuuka wano.
I already know who he is.	Nze mmanyi dda ani.
But that’s not why we’re here.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
He did come.	Yajja ddala.
As it was he didn't really know if anything was really going on.	Nga bwe kyali yali tamanyi ddala oba ddala waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
No, more than that.	Nedda, okusinga ekyo.
We will do this.	Kino tujja kukikola.
He had no brother.	Yali talina muganda we.
Or even what he is.	Oba wadde ky’ali.
It will work either way.	Kijja kukola mu ngeri yonna.
I know the guy.	Nze mmanyi ggaayi.
You have so much in you.	Olina nnyo nnyo mu ggwe.
He was trying, but he had been here before.	Yali agezaako, naye yali abadde wano emabegako.
I'm not so sure.	Sikakasa nnyo.
In the car.	Mu mmotoka.
Probably not immediately.	Oboolyawo si mu bwangu.
I can’t do this.	Kino sisobola kukikola.
This may be the case.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
That was a pivotal moment for me.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kikulu nnyo gyendi.
Of course he was.	Kya lwatu nti yali.
It’s actually something.	Mu butuufu kintu.
However, I loved the dog.	Kyokka, embwa nnali njagala nnyo.
He loves to do his job.	Ayagala nnyo okukola omulimu gwe.
Which anyone would want.	Omuntu yenna kye yandiyagadde.
Very probably when there.	Oboolyawo nnyo nga waliwo.
It will help.	Kijja kuyamba.
He was completely ordinary.	Yali wa bulijjo ddala.
There is.	Waliwo.
Everyone is film to film, film to film.	Buli muntu abeera firimu ku firimu, firimu ku firimu.
Or was it true.	Oba kyali kituufu.
And going back down.	Era okudda wansi.
You should have gone with him.	Wandibadde ogenda naye.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
And we have it.	Era tulina.
But there was nothing he could do.	Naye nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola.
I want to know.	Njagala okumanya.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
For a moment he thought the whole thing would go away.	Okumala akaseera yalowooza nti ekintu kyonna kijja kugenda.
I think we will do it.	Ndowooza tujja kukikola.
But no one wanted to.	Naye tewali yali ayagala.
There is no way whatsoever.	Tewali ngeri yonna yonna.
You don’t have to do anything.	Tolina kukola kintu kyonna.
He was just a guy.	Yali ggaayi yekka.
But he was him.	Naye ye yali ye.
I didn’t want one.	Nnali saagala emu.
He knows how to do it, so many things.	Amanyi okukikola, ebintu bingi nnyo.
In fact, it was.	Mu butuufu, bwe kyali.
It’s hard to think clearly.	Kizibu okulowooza obulungi.
That is what was supposed to happen.	Ekyo kye kyalina okubaawo.
Working is my thing.	Okukola kye kintu kyange.
He would have to go.	Yandibadde alina okugenda.
It’s going to be hard for a long time.	Kigenda kuba kizibu okumala ebbanga ddene.
He needed all the help he could get.	Yali yeetaaga obuyambi bwonna bwe yali asobola okufuna.
In fact, he is the only one.	Mu butuufu ye yekka.
He wanted to go with her.	Yali ayagala kugenda naye.
That’s really not true.	Ekyo ddala si kituufu.
It will be good.	Kijja kuba kirungi.
It is in excellent condition.	Kiri mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
I don’t want to answer.	Saagala kuddamu.
I am not afraid of any man.	Tewali musajja gwe ntya.
It’s all really a labor of love.	Byonna ddala mulimu gwa kwagala.
The book is excellent.	Ekitabo kirungi nnyo.
I knew he would be fine.	Namanya nti ajja kuba bulungi.
He said that he was.	Yagambye nti bwe yali.
I’m here to help.	Nze ndi wano okuyamba.
We were at school together.	Twali ku ssomero nga tuli wamu.
He was still beautiful.	Yali akyali mulungi.
Was that really you?	Ddala oyo wali ggwe?
No one knows anything.	Tewali amanyi kintu kyonna.
This was a bad thing.	Kino kyali kibi.
One problem, anyway.	Ekizibu kimu, mu ngeri yonna.
It was really happening.	Ddala kyali kigenda mu maaso.
And to your dog.	Era eri embwa yo.
Before he did, he was on her.	Nga tannaba kukola, yali ku ye.
What we have is real.	Kye tulina kya ddala.
Perhaps he himself thought he had.	Oboolyawo ye kennyini yalowooza nti yalina.
You know how it is.	Omanyi bwe kiri.
I don’t think anyone will.	Sirowooza nti waliwo ajja kukikola.
Now it’s so bad.	Kati kibi nnyo.
I don’t think he had been good.	Sirowooza nti yali abadde mulungi.
Working with him was a challenge.	Okukola naye kyali kizibu nnyo.
Here, there, and everywhere.	Wano, awo, ne buli wamu.
It goes for whatever he wants.	Kigenda ku kyonna ky’ayagala.
However, I do know one thing.	Kyokka, waliwo ekintu kimu kye mmanyi.
But if only he knew.	Naye singa yali amanyi.
You will do well.	Ojja kukola bulungi.
The food was excellent.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
Or perhaps early.	Oba oboolyawo nga bukyali.
That’s what’s going on here.	Ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso wano.
He is still here.	Akyali wano.
You know, it’s not a bad idea.	Omanyi si kirowoozo kibi.
It's that one.	Ye emu eyo.
However, that is not the case this week.	Kyokka ekyo si bwe kiri wiiki eno.
We are in trouble.	Tuli mu buzibu.
But here we were.	Naye wano we twali.
That was very difficult for me.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo gyendi.
It was probably a good thing.	Oboolyawo kyali kirungi.
We need to see my dad.	Twetaaga okulaba taata wange.
A week, maybe.	Wiiki emu, mpozzi.
I'm not sure though.	Nze sikakasa wadde.
He could have been anyone.	Yali asobola okuba omuntu yenna.
He had the power to do this.	Yalina amaanyi okukola kino.
It is on every house.	Kiri ku buli nnyumba.
Now, don’t go anywhere.	Kati, togenda yonna.
Someone like that.	Omuntu nga oyo.
We’re not going to do anything.	Tetulina kye tugenda kukola.
And also, that there is another.	Era era, nti waliwo omulala.
I can’t do this alone.	Kino sisobola kukikola nzekka.
If he did, he would.	Singa yakikola, yandibadde akola.
This is a place of great beauty.	Kino kifo kya bulungi nnyo.
Apparently that’s what everyone wants.	Kirabika ekyo buli muntu ky’ayagala.
I had been the one.	Nze nali mbadde.
I knew everything.	Buli kimu nnali nkimanyi.
Everything is in place.	Buli kimu kiri mu kifo.
I won’t say what.	Sijja kwogera ki.
The other was real, just as real.	Omulala yali wa ddala, nga wa ddala nga ye.
Maybe not though.	Mpozzi si bwe kiri wadde.
Not the same as below.	Si kye kimu nga wansi.
Obviously they are not.	Kya lwatu si bwe bali.
And it won’t happen.	Era tekijja kubaawo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
But you probably will.	Naye oboolyawo ojja kukikola.
He actually tried.	Mu butuufu yagezaako.
He was really nice, she said.	Yali mulungi ddala, bwe yagambye.
He saw something.	Yalaba ekintu.
Too early, too young, too soon.	Nga bukyali nnyo, muto nnyo, mangu nnyo.
This is my opportunity.	Guno gwe mukisa gwange.
You don’t have to believe anything.	Tolina kukkiriza kintu kyonna.
You will do it with these.	Ojja kukikola ne bino.
I think I was the only one.	Ndowooza nnali nze nzekka.
I could have spoken.	Nnali nsobola okwogera.
Perhaps he does.	Oboolyawo akola bw’atyo.
He could not say why he thought so.	Yali tasobola kwogera lwaki yali alowooza bw’atyo.
That's what he said.	Bwatyo bwe yagamba.
Talking, as my father told me, is easier said than done.	Okwogera, nga taata bwe yang’amba, kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
Perhaps he was.	Oboolyawo yali.
We are now best friends.	Kati tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
I don’t want to either.	Nze nange saagala.
I’m not here to be anyone’s friend.	Siri wano kubeera mukwano gwa muntu yenna.
Let him do the work.	Akole omulimu.
I want to be alone, today.	Njagala kubeera nzekka, leero.
I love this book.	Njagala nnyo ekitabo kino.
And there are so many.	Era waliwo bingi nnyo.
This is really bad.	Kino ddala kibi.
However, in reality, this is a really important thing.	Kyokka, mu butuufu, kino ddala kintu kikulu nnyo.
It was this.	Kyali kino.
He was in good shape.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi.
I just wanted something to eat.	Nnali njagala kya kulya kyokka.
Together.	Ffembi.
That’s very important to me.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo gyendi.
I think for a while.	Ndowooza okumala akaseera.
I knew what he would do.	Nnali mmanyi kye yandikoze.
You don’t have to tell anyone.	Tolina kubuulira muntu yenna.
But there is no child.	Naye tewali mwana.
We certainly are.	Mazima ddala tuli.
And there are so many of them.	Era nga bingi nnyo.
But it was definitely time to move on.	Naye mazima ddala kyali kiseera kya kugenda mu maaso.
That wasn’t my idea.	Ekyo si kye kyali endowooza yange.
He could have been here.	Yali asobola okuba wano.
He was my best friend.	Yali mukwano gwange nnyo.
That would be really bad.	Ekyo ddala kyandibadde kibi.
That was the whole thing.	Ekyo kye kyali ekintu kyonna.
In this process.	Mu nkola eno.
If it were really easy, everyone would be doing it.	Singa ddala kyali kyangu, buli muntu yandibadde akikola.
She wanted what she wanted.	Yali ayagala kye yali ayagala.
None of this is true.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kituufu.
Now, he knew he would have to.	Kati, yali akimanyi nti yandibadde alina okukikola.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
He tried to see.	Yagezaako okulaba.
He said he had no money.	Yagambye nti talina ssente.
I can’t go home.	Sisobola kudda waka.
You know my wife.	Omanyi mukyala wange.
I was sick.	Nnali mulwadde.
It’s going to be good.	Kigenda kuba kirungi.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
I’m sure you’ll agree.	Nkakasa nti ojja kukkiriza.
But this is going on.	Naye kino kigenda mu maaso.
Like me very much.	Nga nze nnyo.
This is simply not true.	Kino si kituufu kyokka.
Maybe nothing is here.	Mpozzi tewali kiri wano.
He doesn’t have a problem.	Talina buzibu.
No one spoke.	Tewali yayogera.
No, we can’t do that.	Nedda, ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
But, you know, that’s okay.	Naye, omanyi, ekyo si kibi.
Nothing was what it seemed.	Tewali kyali kye kyali kirabika.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
He's the problem, that one.	Ye buzibu, oyo.
Not for something like this.	Si ku kintu nga kino.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
But, here we are.	Naye, wano we tuli.
It’s not that you can’t talk.	Si nti tosobola kwogera.
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
I feel like I’m happy.	Mpulira nga ndi musanyufu.
For an hour.	Okumala essaawa emu.
It’s very, very bad.	Kibi nnyo nnyo.
No one had it.	Tewali muntu yenna yalina.
It doesn’t matter what time it is.	Si kikulu obudde bwe buli.
All that, but so much more.	Ebyo byonna, naye bingi nnyo.
He is very happy.	Ye musanyufu nnyo.
I go to work every day.	Ngenda ku mulimu buli lunaku.
That movie is not very good.	Firimu eyo si nnungi nnyo.
However, it was true.	Kyokka kyali kituufu.
I could hit hard.	Nnali nsobola okukuba ennyo.
He was so happy and rightly so.	Yali musanyufu nnyo era nga kituufu.
He could have done a lot of things.	Yandibadde akola ebintu bingi.
Not me, of course.	Si nze, ddala.
That was a daunting task.	Ekyo kyali mulimu gwa maanyi nnyo.
I have been the best man at her wedding.	Nze mbadde musajja asinga obulungi ku mbaga ye.
No, no, no, no.	Nedda nedda nedda.
He had no time for it.	Yali talina budde bwa kukikola.
We can’t wait.	Tetusobola kulinda.
Yeah, of course.	Ye, ddala.
I know this, you know this.	Kino nkimanyi, kino okimanyi.
And now I am.	Era kati nze.
He!' 	Ye!'
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
He is just a happy guy.	Ye ggaayi musanyufu yekka.
He was terrified.	Yali atya nnyo.
And in this case, of course not.	Era mu mbeera eno, ddala si bwe kiri.
You’re not me.	Ggwe si nze.
I don’t know you either.	Nze naawe simanyi.
I am not a doctor.	Siri musawo.
It’s a very complicated thing.	Kintu kizibu nnyo.
And there was so much he wanted to say.	Era nga waliwo bingi bye yali ayagala okwogera.
I have no knowledge on how to do this.	Sirina kumanya ku ngeri y’okukola kino.
I always have.	Bulijjo nnina.
We have to move forward.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso.
I know where he went.	Nze mmanyi gye yagenda.
I know that to be true.	Ekyo nkimanyi nti kituufu.
Something like that.	Ekintu nga ekyo.
It’s good, it’s good that he’s here.	Kirungi, kirungi nti ali wano.
It’s just true.	Kituufu kyokka.
He did well.	Yakola bulungi.
I will be in my office.	Nja kuba mu ofiisi yange.
I can’t believe it.	Sisobola kukkiriza.
We were, too.	Naffe twali.
You would love it.	Wandyagadde nnyo.
They were one.	Baali kimu.
She was very beautiful.	Yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
Maybe it was as simple as that.	Mpozzi nga kyali kyangu nga ekyo.
We are the only ones.	Ffe ffekka.
But no one was saying anything.	Naye tewali yali ayogera kintu kyonna.
It’s this time.	Kye kiseera kino.
I didn’t have to do it.	Nnali sirina kukikola.
The guy was so happy that night.	Ggaayi yali musanyufu nnyo ekiro ekyo.
He had been in the house for an hour.	Yali amaze essaawa emu mu nnyumba.
Not here, obviously.	Si wano, kya lwatu.
However, he was not happy.	Kyokka, yali si musanyufu.
Anyone is fine with me.	Omuntu yenna ali bulungi gyendi.
I thought he was making up the whole thing.	Nalowooza nti ekintu kyonna yali akikola.
It is a really beautiful city.	Kibuga kirungi nnyo ddala.
Obviously, we can’t.	Kya lwatu nti tetusobola.
In this process.	Mu nkola eno.
He got what he wanted.	Yafuna kye yali ayagala.
He needed a job.	Yali yeetaaga omulimu.
It is indeed the case.	Ddala bwe kiri.
He must have heard.	Ateekwa okuba nga yawulira.
In fact, you can do it right now.	Mu butuufu, osobola okukikola mu kiseera kino.
You can know without knowing.	Osobola okumanya nga tomanyi.
And we need that.	Era ekyo twetaaga.
In that, as well.	Mu ekyo, nga bwe kiri.
Much harder than it seems.	Ekizibu ennyo okusinga bwe kirabika.
Maybe it would be.	Mpozzi nga kyandibadde.
I don’t want to know if he could do that.	Saagala kumanya oba ekyo yali asobola okukikola.
Everyone who knows anything knows that.	Buli amanyi ekintu kyonna ekyo akimanyi.
You know you have a date.	Omanyi nti olina olunaku.
Indeed, he was.	Mazima ddala, yali.
Everything is fine at work.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi ku mulimu.
He certainly knew it.	Mazima ddala yali akimanyi.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
Money is not talking.	Ssente si kwogera.
And, yes, that was me.	Era, ye, oyo nnali nze.
You will know better than I do.	Ojja kumanya okusinga nze.
I said it wouldn’t matter.	Nagamba nti tekijja kuba kikulu.
It wasn’t the place you wanted to be.	Si kye kifo kye wali oyagala okubeera.
That's what.	Ekyo kye ki...
This is a good thing.	Kino kirungi.
He had to go back to work, he said.	Yalina okudda ku mulimu, bwe yagambye.
Just like it was mine.	Nga bwe kyali kyange.
He was a good man, and he was my friend.	Yali musajja mulungi, era yali mukwano gwange.
This is a complex problem.	Kino kizibu kizibu.
But it’s up to you.	Naye kiri gyoli.
He is not here well.	Tali wano bulungi.
We don’t have to go anywhere today.	Tetulina kugenda yonna leero.
No, it wasn’t.	Nedda, si bwe yali.
I needed a plan.	Nnali nneetaaga enteekateeka.
I think that’s what’s important.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kikulu.
And now this.	Era kati kino.
I'll go for here.	Nja kugenda ku lwa wano.
He does have a brother.	Alina ddala muganda we.
Of course, it would be important today.	Kya lwatu nti kyandibadde kikulu leero.
You’re my father.	Ggwe taata wange.
I don’t really know why though.	Simanyi ddala lwaki wadde.
She knew what he was thinking.	Yali amanyi kye yali alowooza.
It was a powerful film.	Yali firimu ya maanyi nnyo.
And so far, no one can.	Era okutuuka wano, tewali asobola.
He would be too busy to talk.	Yandibadde bbize nnyo nga tasobola kwogera.
And so did my son.	Era ne mwana wange.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
I can't wait.	Siyinza kulinda.
He might be here.	Ayinza okuba nga ye wano.
It can actually be quite difficult.	Mu butuufu kiyinza okuba nga kizibu nnyo.
This is a very dangerous job.	Omulimu guno gwa bulabe nnyo.
The house was in a great location.	Ennyumba yali mu kifo kirungi nnyo.
We are very, very well.	Tuli bulungi nnyo nnyo.
You know so much.	Omanyi bingi nnyo.
You have to go now.	Olina okugenda kati.
This is not a good thing.	Kino si kintu kirungi.
I was working, myself.	Nze nnali nkola, nze kennyini.
He is in a good place.	Ali mu kifo kirungi.
You don’t have to go alone.	Tolina kugenda wekka.
There are so many reasons.	Ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
He wants to move on.	Ayagala okugenda mu maaso.
I hope this will help someone.	Nsuubira kino kijja kuyamba omuntu.
I mostly think they are not.	Nze okusinga ndowooza nti si bwe bali.
He says he actually has too.	Agamba nti mu butuufu alina naye.
The day of the week.	Olunaku lwa wiiki.
He can’t say when.	Tasobola kwogera ddi.
It’s not a car.	Si mmotoka.
I could definitely be myself with him in every way.	Nnali nsobola ddala okubeera nze kennyini naye mu buli ngeri.
That’s not quite true.	Ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
I was really lucky.	Ddala nnali wa mukisa.
I’ll ride with him.	Nja kuvuga naye.
He was good to me.	Yali mulungi gyendi.
Although his wife.	Wadde nga mukyala we.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
He did well.	Yakola bulungi.
I really needed that.	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga nnyo.
I’m sorry about anything.	Nsonyiwa ku kintu kyonna.
We will do this.	Kino tujja kukikola.
Not always, not under any circumstances.	Si bulijjo, si mu mbeera yonna.
He wants you.	Ayagala ggwe.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
There is no luck.	Tewali mukisa.
when.	ddi.
The point is this.	Ensonga eri nti eno.
There is hope.	Waliwo essuubi.
It’s the same as you.	Kye kimu nga ggwe.
I can’t say when.	Siyinza kwogera ddi.
I don’t know what the reason is for me.	Simanyi nsonga ki gyendi.
I want to be with you.	Njagala kubeera naawe.
You don’t seem well.	Olabika nga tolina bulungi.
It was awful, in a way.	Kyali kibi nnyo, mu ngeri emu.
It may or may not be the truth.	Kiyinza okuba nga kye mazima oba nedda.
He won't be going back to where he was before, either.	Tajja kuba agenda kudda gye yali emabegako, era.
I’m sure it’s him.	Nkakasa nti ye ye.
You are beautiful.	Oli mulungi.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali.
Everything is fine so far.	Buli kimu kirungi okutuusa kati.
Maybe he already had one.	Mpozzi yalina dda emu.
He didn’t know anyone like me, he said.	Yali tamanyi muntu yenna nga nze, bwe yagamba.
He knew they were.	Yali akimanyi nti bwe bali.
We just have it.	Tulina kyokka.
I’m a singer.	Nze ndi muyimbi.
He must have known that.	Ekyo ateekwa okuba nga yali akimanyi.
I needed to do it.	Nnali nneetaaga okukikola.
I can’t do anything.	Sirina kye nsobola kukola.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
I’m not sure it will happen.	Sikakasa nti kijja kubaawo.
And that was definitely going to be a problem.	Era ekyo mazima ddala kyali kigenda kuba kizibu.
You will have to do everything.	Ojja kuba olina okukola buli kimu.
He was alone.	Yali yekka.
As always, he knew his job.	Nga bulijjo, yali amanyi omulimu gwe.
Probably not very good.	Oboolyawo si kirungi nnyo.
He knows he can’t win.	Akimanyi nti tayinza kuwangula.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
He may have been a child of circumstance.	Ayinza okuba nga yali mwana wa mbeera.
This is actually not too bad.	Kino mu butuufu si kibi nnyo.
And, it was important to me.	Era, kyali kikulu gyendi.
I couldn’t really do that.	Ekyo nnali sisobola ddala kukikola.
There is a friend of his.	Waliwo mukwano gwe.
He was being very nice to me.	Yali abeera mulungi nnyo gyendi.
Where were we?	Twali ludda wa?
He was thinking of doing the exact same thing.	Yali alowooza ku kukola ekintu kye kimu ddala.
Now or nothing.	Kati oba tewali.
He didn't want to believe any of this.	Yali tayagala kukkiriza kintu kyonna ku bino.
This is a dangerous place.	Kino kifo kya bulabe.
I was a child at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali mwana muto.
He is really powerful.	Ddala wa maanyi.
Today, it is not.	Leero, si bwe kiri.
I loved reading this book.	Nnali njagala nnyo okusoma ekitabo kino.
That is not uncommon.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo.
It is in the works.	Kiri mu kukola.
We need to talk to him about it.	Tulina okwogera naye ku nsonga eno.
It’s not as fast as it is.	Si kya mangu nga kye.
Every woman wants it.	Buli mukyala ayagala.
He told me.	Yang’amba.
I was very close to him.	Nali kumpi nnyo naye.
That was downstairs.	Ekyo kyali wansi.
You have to read.	Olina okusoma.
If he wanted to he could give up on this whole thing.	Singa yali ayagala asobola okuva ku kintu kino kyonna.
We’ll wait until nightfall.	Tujja kulinda okutuusa ekiro.
And there was something.	Era nga waliwo ekintu.
I need to say.	Nze nneetaaga okugamba.
He hadn't, of course.	Yali talina, ddala.
I am an ordinary man.	Ndi musajja wa bulijjo.
He was my son.	Yali mwana wange.
Maybe, for a while.	Mpozzi, okumala akaseera.
This is all it is.	Kino kyonna kye kiri.
Someone needs to do it.	Waliwo omuntu yeetaaga okukikola.
But of course everyone knew he wasn’t going to be there.	Naye ddala buli omu yali akimanyi nti tagenda kubeerawo.
The same can be seen below.	Ekintu kye kimu osobola okulaba wansi.
We just have to do it as much as we can.	Tulina kumala kukikola nga bwe tusobola.
I don’t know when.	Simanyi ddi.
I think he's there.	Ndowooza ali awo.
He's going to be fine though.	Agenda kuba bulungi wadde.
I am certainly not normal.	Mazima ddala siri wa bulijjo.
It may be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
Certainly, he hadn’t.	Mazima ddala, yali talina.
Or on the subject.	Oba ku nsonga.
However, this is apparently not the only problem.	Kyokka, kirabika kino si kye kyokka ekizibu.
I was a young child.	Nnali mwana muto.
And I know a lot about it.	Era mmanyi bingi ku nsonga eyo.
And that’s not what it is.	Era ekyo si kye kiri.
I think you should come with me.	Ndowooza wandibadde ojja nange.
Everyone was sick.	Buli omu yali mulwadde.
It’s the same for everyone, of course.	Kye kimu eri buli muntu, ddala.
I don't think anyone can!.	Sirowooza nti waliwo asobola!.
But not for anyone.	Naye si lwa muntu.
He beats his girlfriend.	Akuba muganzi we.
However, someone else had.	Kyokka waliwo omuntu omulala yalina.
I could probably go on.	Oboolyawo nnali nsobola okugenda mu maaso.
However, that will happen.	Kyokka, ekyo kijja kubaawo.
We’re coming to you.	Tujja gy’oli.
He was thinking.	Yali alowooza.
It was a terrible time for me.	Kyali kiseera kibi nnyo gyendi.
It's at home.	Kiri waka.
Exactly the same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu ddala.
He didn’t want to talk about it.	Yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
That is why we can do that.	Ye nsonga lwaki tusobola okukola ekyo.
I knew he would come.	Nali mmanyi nti ajja kujja.
You can’t stay here.	Tosobola kusigala wano.
And no one right now.	Era tewali muntu yenna mu kiseera kino.
Now this is low.	Kati kino kya wansi.
He looks almost perfectly fine.	Alabika kumpi bulungi ddala.
The night is coming, when no one will be able to work.	Ekiro kijja, nga tewali ajja kusobola kukola.
There is really no right or wrong.	Mu butuufu tewali kirungi oba kibi.
To the guy.	Eri ggaayi.
We certainly are.	Mazima ddala tuli.
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
I was in for him.	Nali mu lwa ye.
She really went ahead with him.	Ddala yagenda mu maaso naye.
Everyone here knows the office.	Buli muntu wano amanyi ofiisi.
He is really very good.	Ddala mulungi nnyo.
We are at the police station.	Tuli ku poliisi.
This is, of course, not true.	Kino, kya lwatu si kituufu.
I’m doing really well.	Nkola bulungi ddala.
He could have gone.	Yali asobola okugenda.
But that is not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu.
That was a problem, obviously.	Ekyo kyali kizibu, kya lwatu.
They were on us.	Baali ku ffe.
We will be going.	Tujja kuba tugenda.
Tom works hard.	Tom akola nnyo.
This house is not ordinary.	Ennyumba eno si ya bulijjo.
That was a very difficult time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo.
You think about it.	Ggwe olowooza.
I thought it was a great idea.	Nalowooza nti kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
Everyone is talking about it.	Buli omu ayogera ku nsonga eno.
And she looks good.	Era alabika bulungi.
He spoke very, very well.	Yayogera bulungi nnyo nnyo.
He had to work in the morning.	Yalina okukola ku makya.
In the meantime he should have stayed at home.	Mu kiseera kino yandibadde abeera waka.
You certainly know.	Mazima ddala omanyi.
And maybe that was it.	Era mpozzi ekyo kye kyali.
Speaking is difficult.	Okwogera kizibu.
But it’s not true.	Naye si kituufu.
This is the only one.	Kino kyokka.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
I had found it.	Nze nnali nfunye.
I think you know where this is going.	Ndowooza omanyi kino gye kigenda.
It was really, really hard.	Ddala ddala kyali kizibu.
Why, in my time.	Lwaki, mu kiseera kyange.
I was very much.	Nze nali nnyo.
And this is very important.	Era kino kikulu nnyo.
It worked fine for a while.	Yakola bulungi okumala akaseera.
Not really, anyway.	Si ddala, mu ngeri yonna.
I want you.	Njagala ggwe.
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
He knew it wasn’t him.	Yali akimanyi nti si ye.
That’s where we are.	Awo we tuli.
But there is no reason.	Naye tewali nsonga yonna.
Or, well, basically everything.	Oba, bulungi, okusinga buli kimu.
However, that is true, that is my point.	Kyokka ekyo kituufu, eyo y’ensonga yange.
There is one in each class.	Mu buli kibiina mulimu omu.
That is why we are here tonight.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki tuli wano ekiro kino.
I'm moving on tonight.	Ngenda mu maaso ekiro kino.
It will come to me.	Kijja kujja gyendi.
It can happen again.	Kiyinza okuddamu okubaawo.
I want.	Njagala.
Everyone had it.	Buli omu yalina.
I was at home.	Nnali waka.
He certainly did.	Mazima ddala yakikola.
This is very common.	Kino kya bulijjo nnyo.
But he didn’t know everything.	Naye nga tamanyi buli kimu.
I was so beautiful.	Nnali mulungi nnyo.
Perhaps he had.	Oboolyawo yalina.
It is, and yet it is not.	Kiri, era naye si bwe kiri.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
But probably not for long.	Naye oboolyawo si lwa bbanga ddene.
That alone will not do.	Ekyo kyokka tekijja kukola.
He obviously has that.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo alina.
But it was very plain.	Naye kyali kya lwatu nnyo.
What was he doing.	Kiki kye yali akola.
I don’t want to know.	Saagala kumanya.
This is not like you.	Kino si nga ggwe.
And he was beautiful.	Era yali mulungi.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
I still don't know how.	Nze n'okutuusa kati simanyi ngeri ki.
I still don’t like the place.	N’okutuusa kati sikyagala kifo.
That can do it.	Ekyo kiyinza okukikola.
That was dangerous.	Ekyo kyali kya bulabe.
You work really hard.	Okola nnyo ddala.
Maybe that was a bad thing.	Mpozzi ekyo kyali kibi.
And he has a lot of money.	Era alina ssente nnyingi nnyo.
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
You are not a good person.	Toli muntu mulungi.
But it was a good movie.	Naye yali firimu nnungi.
All he knew was that it was real.	Kye yali amanyi nti kyali kya ddala.
And they are strong.	Era ba maanyi.
And it’s very common.	Era nga kya bulijjo nnyo.
It is as well as he did.	Kiri bulungi nga bwe yakola.
Sorry.	Nsonyiwa.
But it was actually pretty good.	Naye mu butuufu kyali kirungi nnyo.
This is a party.	Eno mbaga.
Back to work.	Okudda ku mulimu.
But he was, and he will be.	Naye yali, era ajja kuba.
I love this stuff.	Njagala nnyo ebintu bino.
I feel that it was very difficult!	Mpulira nti kyali kizibu nnyo!
We need to get help.	Tulina okufuna obuyambi.
I was very busy at work today.	Leero nnali bbize nnyo ku mulimu.
There is beauty everywhere.	Buli wamu waliwo obulungi.
It’s not a problem at all.	Si kizibu n’akatono.
But we need to get help.	Naye twetaaga okufuna obuyambi.
Not here, not for her.	Si wano, si lwa ye.
He needs to do it.	Yeetaaga okukikola.
I know it doesn’t really matter.	Nkimanyi nti mu butuufu si kikulu.
But it’s not how it really is.	Naye si ngeri gye kiri ddala.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
There is no harm.	Tewali bulabe bwonna.
No, it can happen to anyone.	Nedda, kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna.
It’s good for you.	Kirungi gyoli.
He started well, seemed like a nice guy.	Yatandika bulungi, yalabika nga ggaayi omulungi.
And yet here it is.	Era naye wano we wali.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
I hope you don’t have to be here.	Nsuubira nti tolina kubeera wano.
We will be there.	Tujja kubeerawo.
We are all the same.	Ffenna tuli kimu.
It comes to me.	Kijja gyendi.
I am now very happy.	Nze kati ndi musanyufu nnyo.
Not in a preachy way.	Si mu ngeri ya kubuulira.
I’ve been here.	Nze mbadde wano.
This is not exactly the case.	Kino si bwe kiri ddala.
It was everywhere, in the air.	Kyali buli wamu, mu bbanga.
A house is not money.	Ennyumba si ssente.
And when he spoke.	Era bwe yayogera.
I couldn’t tell who it was.	Nnali sisobola kumanya ani.
It will never happen again.	Tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
I’m a young man.	Nze ndi muto.
It was just this.	Kyali kino kyokka.
I wasn’t really interested in relationships.	Nze nali sifaayo nnyo ku mukwano.
Perhaps that was lucky for his wife.	Oboolyawo ekyo kyali kya mukisa eri mukyala we.
Now I can’t do it.	Kati sisobola kukikola.
And it’s bad for everyone.	Era kibi eri buli muntu.
You have to be good.	Olina okuba nga oli mulungi.
You can basically do what you want with this.	Okusinga osobola okukola kyoyagala ne kino.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
I hope you know this.	Nsuubira nti kino okimanyi.
And he does it well.	Era akikola bulungi.
He wanted to know what was going on.	Yali ayagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso.
That’s everyone.	Oyo ye buli muntu.
The weather is fine.	Obudde buli bulungi.
I don’t think we will.	Sirowooza nti tujja kukikola.
Where is my phone?	Essimu yange eri ludda wa?
This was one thing.	Kino kyali kimu.
He loves everyone.	Ayagala nnyo buli muntu.
I don’t know why.	Simanyi lwaki.
But it was awful for me.	Naye kyali kibi nnyo gyendi.
In this process.	Mu nkola eno.
He made a speech.	Yakola okwogera.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
He knew why he was doing this.	Yali amanyi lwaki yali akola kino.
He says that is not the case here.	Agamba nti wano si bwe kiri.
But in any case he could go into himself.	Naye mu mbeera yonna gye yali asobola kugenda mu ye kennyini.
You know exactly.	Omanyi bulungi.
In this way .	Mu ngeri eno .
You want to help but you can’t.	Oyagala kuyamba naye tosobola.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Si kintu kyangu okukola.
I wonder about my watch.	Nneebuuza ku ssaawa yange.
No one knew the truth.	Tewali muntu yenna yali amanyi mazima.
I know he can’t.	Nkimanyi nti tasobola.
You want to.	Oyagala.
It’s not that I don’t want to, I do.	Si nti saagala, njagala.
In a sense, he had.	Mu ngeri emu, yalina.
But it is what it is.	Naye kye kiri.
I have to move on.	Nnina okugenda mu maaso.
I will be back very soon.	Nja kudda mu bbanga ttono ddala.
And he had to tell someone.	Era yalina okubuulira omuntu.
We don’t have much time to work.	Tetulina bbanga ddene okukola.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
It was probably a good idea to tell someone about it.	Oboolyawo kyali kirungi okubuulira omuntu ku nsonga eyo.
Everything had to be his way.	Buli kimu kyalina okuba nga kiri mu ngeri ye.
That is not the truth.	Ekyo si kye kituufu.
This is the only one.	Kino kye kimu kyokka.
Or here here.	Oba wano wano.
That’s very hard to do.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo okukola.
He was very friendly.	Yali wa mukwano nnyo.
We are the only ones.	Ffe tuli kyokka.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
He loved the book.	Yali ayagala nnyo ekitabo ekyo.
He made a lot of money.	Yafuna ssente nnyingi.
What do you want to eat today?	Oyagala kulya ki leero?
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza.
It may be his.	Kiyinza okuba nga kye.
Nothing ordinary, nothing real.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo, tewali kintu kya ddala.
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kirungi.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
He wanted to do everything.	Yali ayagala okukola buli kimu.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Sikakasa buzibu ki.
I was just happy.	Nali musanyufu kyokka.
You have to go, my friend.	Olina okugenda mukwano gwange.
He works long hours.	Akola essaawa nnyingi.
I didn’t know why it was happening.	Nnali simanyi lwaki kyali kigenda mu maaso.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
I was happy with him.	Nali musanyufu naye.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
We certainly can’t.	Mazima ddala tetusobola.
It was definitely happening.	Mazima ddala kyali kigenda mu maaso.
I’ve been thinking about you.	Mbadde ndowooza ku ggwe.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe yali.
He doesn't know what to say.	Tamanyi kya kwogera.
But no one is visible.	Naye tewali alabika.
No one knew where he lived.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yali abeera.
This is just one city.	Kino kibuga kimu kyokka.
We probably will.	Oboolyawo tujja kukikola.
And what is this? 	Era kino kye ki?
He was going to be just fine.	Yali agenda kuba bulungi nnyo.
I think this is a great idea.	Ndowooza kino kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I don’t even know how.	Simanyi na ngeri ki.
But, obviously, you’re too young.	Naye, kya lwatu, oli muto nnyo.
I don’t want to go to the doctor for a while.	Saagala kugenda wa musawo okumala akaseera.
He is my father.	Ye taata wange.
But that wasn’t the point.	Naye eyo si ye yali ensonga.
That was the whole problem.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu kyonna.
I will never have something like that.	Sijja kuba na kintu nga ekyo.
And that's why he's with her.	Era y'ensonga lwaki ali naye.
She looked really good.	Yalabika nga mulungi ddala.
I don’t want to go home.	Saagala kudda waka.
You know.	Omanyi.
Every doctor had it.	Buli musawo yalina.
On his part.	Ku ludda lwe.
As in a way, it should be.	Nga bwe kiri mu ngeri emu, bwe kyandibadde.
I was at work.	Nnali ku mulimu.
I don't want to.	Saagala.
Doing it quickly was.	Okukikola amangu kyali.
He is a strong man.	Ye musajja wa maanyi.
Just a little while longer!	Akaseera katono ddala!
But that’s next week.	Naye eyo wiiki ejja.
He said that was a really good idea.	Yagambye nti ekyo ddala kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
He doesn’t have much money.	Talina ssente nnyingi.
But she looked good too.	Naye naye yali alabika bulungi.
A little bit lower.	Wansi katono.
Not without a plan.	Si nga tewali nteekateeka.
There is no reason.	Tewali nsonga yonna.
I'll go.	Nja kugenda.
Not me, he thought.	Si nze, bwe yalowooza.
This is what is going to happen.	Kino kye kigenda okubaawo.
Maybe that’s the reason.	Mpozzi eyo y’ensonga lwaki.
I knew he had it.	Nali mmanyi nti yalina.
Why would he do such a thing.	Lwaki yandikoze ekintu ng’ekyo.
I guess it just might work.	Ntebereza nti kiyinza okukola kyokka.
That’s where he was supposed to go.	Eyo gye yali alina okugenda.
There is no easy answer.	Tewali kyangu kya kuddamu.
Maybe he did the whole thing.	Mpozzi ekintu kyonna ye yakikola.
Nothing mattered.	Tewali kyali kikulu.
Dinner was a feast!	Ekyeggulo kyali kya mbaga!
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
That is what it is for us.	Ekyo kye kiri gye tuli.
That’s very important to me.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo gyendi.
It can happen to anyone.	Kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna.
He got the phone and everything.	Yafuna essimu ne buli kimu.
Will definitely do again.	Mazima ddala ajja kuddamu okukola.
He needed help.	Yali yeetaaga okuyamba.
That could easily happen again.	Ekyo kyali kyangu okuddamu okubaawo.
I had no plans whatsoever.	Nnali sirina nteekateeka yonna.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
That’s a terrible idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kibi nnyo.
But there is nothing.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna.
And he was in a hurry, too.	Era naye yali mu bwangu, naye.
If he went now, he would be alone.	Singa yagenda kati, yandibadde yekka.
She actually looks great.	Mu butuufu alabika bulungi nnyo.
He won’t be able to!	Tajja kusobola!
You are a good friend.	Oli mukwano mulungi.
He knows you’re here.	Akimanyi nti oli wano.
No, not just about him.	Nedda, si ku ye yekka.
Nothing about that.	Tewali kintu kyonna ku ekyo.
Apparently he needs one.	Kirabika yeetaaga emu.
I may have been good.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnali mulungi.
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kirungi.
He was alone in the room at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali yekka mu kisenge.
This book is hard to read.	Ekitabo kino kizibu okusoma.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
He had to get to work.	Yalina okutuuka ku mulimu.
But, that wasn’t the point.	Naye, eyo si ye yali ensonga.
He did really well, too.	Yakola bulungi ddala, naye.
I will never do something like that again.	Sijja kuddamu kukola kintu ng’ekyo.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
That's all it is.	Ekyo kyonna kye kiri.
So he thought that.	Bwatyo bwe yalowooza nti.
You are not mine.	Ggwe toli wange.
He was the only one not in his room.	Ye yekka yali tali mu kisenge kye.
Right now.	Kati.
The way it is.	Engeri gye kiri.
Not everything.	Si buli kimu.
I can’t go back down.	Sisobola kudda wansi.
She was so nice and so happy.	Yali mulungi nnyo era nga musanyufu nnyo.
He speaks very quickly.	Ayogera mangu nnyo.
But here it is important.	Naye wano kikulu.
Or a lot more.	Oba bingi nnyo.
I was actually planning to do the same thing.	Mu butuufu nnali nteekateeka okukola ekintu kye kimu.
He is the power.	Ye maanyi.
Not for anyone.	Si lwa muntu yenna.
He has a dog with him.	Alina embwa naye.
You don’t know me either.	Tomanyi nange.
On the classroom.	Ku kibiina.
We can’t see it.	Tetusobola kulaba.
Do you have his luck? 	Olina omukisa gwe?
Just one thing.	Ekintu kimu kyokka.
This was hard to say.	Kino kyali kizibu okwogera.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
He is obviously happy.	Kya lwatu nti musanyufu.
I couldn’t find a way to move on.	Nnali sisobola kufuna ngeri ya kugenda mu maaso.
We have to act now.	Tulina okukola kati.
He couldn’t see.	Yali tasobola kulaba.
But it’s not, of course.	Naye si bwe kiri, ddala.
It’s not hard to see.	Si kizibu okulaba.
He talks a lot.	Ayogera nnyo.
He actually said that.	Mu butuufu yayogera bw’atyo.
He was very lonely.	Yali yekka nnyo.
And that might just work.	Era ekyo kiyinza okumala okukola.
From you know.	Okuva mu ggwe omanyi.
It could very easily be me.	Kyangu nnyo kyandibadde nze.
He was very good to me.	Yali mulungi nnyo gyendi.
It may be true.	Kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
He cannot be like us.	Tasobola kubeera nga ffe.
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
He could hardly speak.	Yali tasobola bulungi kwogera.
I didn’t want to see.	Nnali saagala kulaba.
No one has to go.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kugenda.
He had trouble speaking.	Yafuna obuzibu okwogera.
More than ever.	Okusinga ku buli kiseera.
We are very	Ffe tuli nnyo .
And my father was one.	Era taata yali omu.
The beautiful one.	Omulungi.
They are at this point.	Bali ku kifo kino.
He can’t believe it.	Tayinza kukkiriza.
This was an opinion.	Eno yali ndowooza.
But this is not the point here.	Naye eno si y’ensonga wano.
I don’t know if he knows.	Simanyi oba amanyi.
He is much better.	Asinga nnyo.
He couldn’t stay here long.	Yali tasobola kumala wano bbanga ddene.
What a wonderful idea.	Nga kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
And my brother.	Ne muganda wange.
Everyone is friendly in the movie room.	Buli muntu wa mukwano mu kisenge kya firimu.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
He was just there doing his thing.	Yali awo yekka ng’akola ebintu bye.
Urgent.	Mangu.
And yet he wasn’t.	Era naye nga si bwe yali.
We are very low here.	Tuli wansi nnyo wano.
Every morning.	Buli ku makya.
He wasn’t himself.	Ye yali si ye kennyini.
Everyone could see that.	Ekyo buli omu yali asobola okulaba.
He told me he could definitely help.	Yang’amba nti asobola ddala okuyamba.
Down on the car.	Wansi ku mmotoka.
One person is comfortable, one person is not.	Omuntu omu abeera bulungi, omuntu omu si bwe kiri.
No, it is not.	Nedda si bwe kiri.
Is there something going on?	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso?
He could have answered this.	Kino yandibadde asobola okuddamu.
Nothing and no one.	Tewali kintu kyonna era tewali muntu yenna.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
We will do the same.	Naffe tujja kukola kye kimu.
Of course, he has done this before.	Kya lwatu nti kino yakikola emabegako.
. . . .	.
I didn’t know if I had hope or not.	Nnali simanyi oba nnina essuubi oba nedda.
That’s where he was.	Eyo gye yali.
This is also true here.	Kino ne wano kituufu.
Which he was trying to do.	Kye yali agezaako okukola.
Very true, you know.	Kituufu nnyo, omanyi.
This is what it is to be a father.	Kino kye kiri okubeera taata.
When he went with his friend.	Bwe yagenda ne mukwano gwe.
He is very happy.	Musanyufu nnyo.
He was down on himself.	Yali wansi ku ye kennyini.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
There is no money there.	Tewali ssente eyo.
I don't want to.	Saagala.
And why should you!.	Era lwaki wandibadde okola!.
I am in a lucky position.	Ndi mu mbeera ya mukisa.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
That was a bad time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kibi.
I don’t think anyone should.	Sirowooza nti waliwo omuntu yenna alina okukikola.
Everything is fine, of course.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi, ddala.
We can do that too.	Ekyo naffe tusobola okukikola.
That’s not what you want to do in this situation.	Ekyo si ky’oyagala okukola mu mbeera eno.
Just watching this happen.	Okumala okulaba kino nga kigenda mu maaso.
Maybe that won’t happen.	Mpozzi ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
You know, pretty simple as that.	Omanyi, kirungi nnyo nga kyangu nga ekyo.
It would have gone to me.	Kyandibadde kigenda gyendi.
He was there.	Yali awo.
He will have the opportunity to do a good job.	Ajja kufuna omukisa okukola omulimu omulungi.
I didn’t have any money.	Nnali sirina ssente yonna.
I feel like everyone else.	Mpulira nga buli muntu omulala.
He is a teacher.	Ye musomesa.
I'm going to move on.	Nze ngenda mu maaso.
He doesn’t have much money.	Talina ssente nnyingi.
This is a very powerful organization.	Kino kibiina kya maanyi nnyo.
But there is nothing wrong with it.	Naye tewali kibi kyonna.
But, he did, right?'.	Naye, yakikola, nedda?'.
I am alone here.	Nze wano ndi nzekka.
But for now, this is okay.	Naye mu kiseera kino, kino si kibi.
He was an only child.	Yali mwana yekka.
But it’s not too difficult.	Naye si kizibu nnyo.
Like, you always were.	Nga, bulijjo wali.
I really can.	Ddala nsobola.
That’s what it is.	Kye kiri.
No work, no money.	Tewali mulimu, tewali ssente.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
But he won’t eat again.	Naye tajja kuddamu kulya.
You are only human, whether you like it or not.	Oli muntu yekka, oba oyagala oba nedda.
He has to arrive on time.	Alina okutuuka mu budde.
I love this book.	Njagala nnyo ekitabo kino.
What does it matter to me.	Nze kikulu ki.
Not now, maybe not.	Si kati, mpozzi nedda.
I love his work.	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
The problem is with me.	Obuzibu bwe buli ku nze.
We have to be on the side.	Tulina okubeera ku ludda.
Now there is no problem.	Kati tewali buzibu bwonna.
You will not be as strong as we are.	Tojja kuba wa maanyi nga ffe.
I still can’t believe it.	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kukkiriza.
Not too many.	Si nnyingi nnyo.
He had no money.	Yali talina ssente.
And he was with her.	Era yali naye.
I thought that was pretty cool.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
He knows you are a very busy man.	Akimanyi nti oli musajja bbize nnyo.
Not exactly well, but he was home.	Si bulungi ddala, naye yali waka.
But he couldn’t.	Naye yali tasobola.
It was a lot of money.	Yali ssente nnyingi nnyo.
I know a lot about your plan.	Nze mmanyi bingi ku nteekateeka yo.
I have one too.	Nange nnina emu.
He is nothing.	Ye si kintu kyonna.
It was coming tonight.	Yali ejja ekiro kino.
That attitude is dangerous.	Endowooza eyo ya bulabe.
Everyone will wait.	Buli omu ajja kulinda.
I think my plan worked.	Ndowooza enteekateeka yange yakola.
No one knows for sure.	Tewali amanyi bulungi.
No, that’s true.	Nedda, ekyo kituufu.
As it is, it is.	Nga bwe kiri.
Nothing is easy.	Tewali kintu kyangu.
Almost but not quite.	Kumpi naye si ddala.
But that doesn’t matter.	Naye ekyo si kikulu.
Perhaps now was the moment.	Oboolyawo kati kye kyali akaseera.
And he was.	Era yali.
She loved everything.	Yali ayagala nnyo buli kimu.
Everything was fine until last week.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi okutuusa wiiki ewedde.
He should have done it himself.	Yandibadde akikola ye kennyini.
And that’s not good.	Era ekyo si kirungi.
And then everyone but me can come back.	Era awo buli muntu okuggyako nze asobola okudda.
That’s all that matters to me.	Ekyo kyokka kye kikulu gyendi.
Always on me as well.	Bulijjo ku nze nga bwe kiri.
Are you too sick to attend class?	Oli mulwadde nnyo nga tosobola kugenda mu kibiina?
He could do this.	Kino yali asobola okukikola.
But he isn’t.	Naye ye si bwe kiri.
He was just terrified.	Yali atya nnyo kyokka.
He is happy to do so.	Musanyufu okukikola.
He doesn’t have the money.	Talina ssente.
Really! 	Kituufu!
That was one approach.	Eyo yali nkola emu.
Indeed, she looks good.	Mazima ddala, alabika bulungi.
That one.	Oyo omu.
No.	Nedda.
I don’t want to be anymore.	Saagala kuddamu kubeera.
Now we were on to something.	Kati twali ku kintu.
When are we going to go?	Tugenda kugenda ddi?
It’s easy to get things done.	Kyangu okukola ebintu.
It was a bad place.	Kyali kifo kibi.
And it was a beautiful night.	Era ekiro kyali kirungi nnyo.
We are very well off.	Tuli bulungi nnyo.
I can do that, you know.	Ekyo nsobola okukikola, omanyi.
He wasn’t happy.	Yali si musanyufu.
He has the power.	Alina amaanyi.
I could imagine he had.	Nnali nsobola okulowooza nti yalina.
I knew that for sure.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi ddala.
Maybe, he thought.	Mpozzi, bwe yalowooza.
Being here with you is not good.	Okubeera wano naawe si kirungi.
But he couldn’t.	Naye nga tasobola.
I have no way of knowing.	Sirina ngeri gye nnyinza kumanya.
Perhaps he had nothing to do.	Oboolyawo yali talina ky’alina kukola.
He was ready to go.	Yali mwetegefu okugenda.
I'm not so sure.	Sikakasa nnyo.
I’m a man.	Nze ndi musajja.
Where were they?.	Baali ludda wa?.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	Yali amanyi bulungi kye yali ayagala.
Or you.	Oba ggwe.
Since this is normal.	Okuva bwe kiri nti kino kya bulijjo.
He wanted to stay in.	Yali ayagala kusigala mu.
No one can know.	Tewali asobola kumanya.
I almost certainly will.	Kumpi ddala nja kukikola.
This is a good thing .	Kino kintu kirungi .
He thought about it.	Yalowooza ku nsonga eyo.
It’s not a thing.	Si kintu.
He speaks well.	Ayogera bulungi.
And it’s going to happen very soon.	Era kigenda kubaawo mu bbanga ttono ddala.
I'm not even sure if I can get anything.	Sikakasa wadde oba waliwo kye nnyinza okufuna.
He was a little sleepy.	Yali yeebase katono.
I need to work hard again.	Nze nneetaaga okuddamu okukola ennyo.
Or perhaps earlier.	Oba oboolyawo emabegako.
But it’s almost close.	Naye nga kumpi kumpi.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
The police are there now.	Poliisi eri awo kati.
He said it was something he had to do.	Yagambye nti kyali kintu ky’alina okukola.
He worked hard.	Yakola nnyo.
Good for everything.	Kirungi ku buli kimu.
He had no such thing.	Yali talina kintu ng’ekyo.
And he was still there.	Era yali akyali awo.
But he had a chance to think.	Naye yafuna omukisa okulowooza.
It certainly was.	Mazima ddala bwe kyali.
Who is he.	Ani nga ye...
This is a very dangerous place to be!	Kino kifo kya bulabe nnyo okubeera!
I want to know what they are.	Njagala kumanya kye bali.
It seems to be the case.	Kirabika nga bwe kiri.
I couldn’t do that.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola.
I’m sure he’s sleeping soundly.	Nkakasa nti yeebase bulungi.
I just wanted to see what would happen.	Nnali njagala kulaba kyokka ekigenda okubaawo.
Let him do his job.	Akole omulimu gwe.
We have to go.	Tulina okugenda.
I certainly could do it.	Mazima ddala nnali nsobola okukikola.
I don’t think he will.	Sirowooza nti ajja kukikola.
She was really good looking.	Ddala yali alabika bulungi.
He's lucky, that one.	Alina omukisa, oyo.
In practice.	Mu nkola.
It’s time to go now.	Kye kiseera okugenda kati.
What we have to say.	Kye tulina okwogera.
I couldn’t live with myself.	Nnali sisobola kubeera nange kennyini.
It’s not the same everywhere.	Si kye kimu buli wamu.
This is a serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi.
He says now is not a good time.	Agamba nti kati si kiseera kirungi.
He was in the room.	Yali mu kisenge.
He can do anything.	Asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
I was close to him.	Nali kumpi naye.
He does this well.	Kino akikola bulungi.
And it's your movie, that's fine.	Era ye firimu yo, ekyo kirungi.
And perhaps he might be.	Era oboolyawo ayinza okubaawo.
What he didn’t know was why.	Kye yali tamanyi ye nsonga lwaki.
I don’t think that was true.	Ekyo sirowooza nti kyali kituufu.
He lives within an hour of the city.	Abeera mu ssaawa emu okuva mu kibuga.
I’m not good enough.	Nze siri mulungi.
I don’t want to have to tell anyone.	Saagala kubeera na kubuulira muntu yenna.
No one knows the reason.	Tewali amanyi nsonga.
He seems alone in this opinion.	Alabika ali yekka mu ndowooza eno.
However, no one does.	Kyokka tewali akikola.
Home or office, it doesn’t matter.	Awaka oba ofiisi, si kikulu.
And he needed someone for this job.	Era ku mulimu guno yali yeetaaga omuntu.
He just wanted to talk to her.	Yali ayagala kwogera naye yekka.
Everyone knew that.	Ekyo buli omu yali akimanyi.
Really.	Kituufu.
He is just there for me.	Ali awo yekka gyendi.
You knew better.	Ggwe wali omanyi bulungi.
You could do something like this.	Oyinza okukola ekintu nga kino.
You certainly know it.	Mazima ddala okimanyi.
I didn’t know how or why.	Nze nali simanyi ngeri ki oba lwaki.
No issues from me here.	Tewali nsonga okuva gyendi wano.
And it won’t do anything.	Era tekijja kukola kintu kyonna.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
We need some time here.	Twetaaga akaseera wano.
There was no way he did this.	Tewali ngeri yonna gye yakola kino.
There is another one of us.	Waliwo omulala ku ffe.
It goes downhill.	Kigenda wansi.
I was the only man.	Nze nali musajja yekka.
I don’t want to go back to the office.	Saagala kudda mu ofiisi.
I know that it is.	Nkimanyi nti bwe kiri.
Someone who has.	Omuntu alina.
Like, of course.	Nga, ddala.
That’s all that matters.	Ekyo kyokka kye kikulu.
In fact, it is very, very difficult.	Mu butuufu, kizibu nnyo nnyo.
This I am not good at this.	Kino siri mulungi mu kino.
I have to get everything just right.	Nnina okufuna buli kimu nga kituufu.
He knew what he had to do.	Yali amanyi ky’alina okukola.
Maybe my wife.	Mpozzi mukyala wange.
I was fine.	Nnali bulungi.
It would have been easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu.
And you will be there.	Era ojja kuba awo.
Someone had to get lucky.	Waliwo omuntu yalina okufuna omukisa.
However, that is not the only problem.	Kyokka ekyo si kye kizibu kyokka.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
But he does it.	Naye akikola.
That’s my point.	Eyo y’ensonga yange.
She really looked good.	Ddala yalabika bulungi.
I didn’t know that thing.	Ekintu ekyo nnali simanyi.
He is at home with his wife.	Ali waka ne mukyala we.
He knows everything.	Amanyi buli kimu.
Where he is not with you.	W'ali nga tali naawe.
Tonight's night.	Ekiro kya leero.
Maybe not everywhere.	Mpozzi si buli wamu.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
Anything but this.	Ekintu kyonna okuggyako kino.
But for him it had to be true.	Naye ku ye kyalina okuba nga kituufu.
I hope you are doing well.	Nsuubira nti okola bulungi.
That was actually good for me.	Ekyo mu butuufu kyali kirungi gyendi.
And nothing about him.	Era tewali kintu kyonna ku ye.
I’m sure you’ll want to hang out with me.	Nkakasa nti ojja kwagala okubeera nange.
And this is what it is.	Era kino kye kiri.
Perhaps he had been.	Oboolyawo yali abadde.
He got a lot of his.	Yafuna bingi ku bye.
Why he'd been talking, he didn't know.	Lwaki abadde ayogera, yali tamanyi.
I want your opinion.	Njagala endowooza yo.
What a wonderful idea.	Nga kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
The food was excellent.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
But other than that, everything was fine.	Naye okuggyako ekyo, buli kimu kyali kirungi.
But not in this way.	Naye si mu ngeri eno.
And to me.	Era gyendi.
But he was there.	Naye yali awo.
I had no interest in much.	Nnali sirina kye njagala mu bingi.
I don’t have any plans.	Sirina nteekateeka yonna.
He didn’t have much time.	Yali talina budde bungi.
I don’t want to go.	Saagala kugenda.
And that is not the case.	Era ekyo si bwe kiri.
I think he does a pretty good job.	Ndowooza akola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
That’s what we should be doing.	Ekyo tusaanidde okukikola.
He should have just gone home.	Yandibadde amaze kudda waka.
My father told me it was a bad idea.	Taata yang’amba nti kyali kirowoozo kibi.
Not like he did it.	Si nga bwe yakikola.
He had to move on.	Yalina okugenda mu maaso.
Getting food, or buying food.	Okufuna emmere, oba okugula emmere.
That’s good for me.	Ekyo kirungi gyendi.
It was just so right.	Kyali kituufu nnyo kyokka.
It would be nice, he thought.	Kyandibadde kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
A good friend, though.	Mukwano omulungi, wadde.
She is a very artistic woman.	Mukyala muyimbi nnyo.
I wasn’t that.	Nze nali si ekyo.
He would be home in a week.	Yandibadde awaka mu wiiki emu.
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
I won’t go anywhere.	Sijja kugenda yonna.
There is no feeling whatsoever.	Tewali mpulira yonna.
What he knows, he knows.	Kye amanyi, akimanyi.
No one can tell any of us anything.	Tewali ayinza kubuulira muntu yenna ku ffe ekintu kyonna.
He can’t talk for long.	Tasobola kwogera bbanga ddene.
It is a very important thing.	Kintu kikulu nnyo.
You know why.	Omanyi lwaki.
No, he can work.	Nedda asobola kukola.
Hope is a thing.	Essuubi kintu.
I can be that guy.	Nsobola okuba ggaayi oyo.
However, that is probably not the case for everyone.	Kyokka, osanga ekyo si bwe kiri eri buli muntu.
Or we are moving forward.	Oba tugenda mu maaso.
I was beautiful.	Nali mulungi.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
He did absolutely.	Yakikola ddala.
In a sense he was.	Mu ngeri emu yali.
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
I guess you will.	Ntebereza nti ojja kukola.
It doesn’t matter.	Si nsonga.
He has a very nice personality.	Alina omuntu omulungi ennyo.
I'm with him.	Nze naye.
I'm fine.	Ndi bulungi.
This is actually true.	Kino mu butuufu kituufu.
I wondered what he was doing.	Nneebuuza kye yali akola.
I think it’s a great practice.	Ndowooza nkola nnungi nnyo.
Like now.	Nga kati.
He is his friend.	Ye mukwano gwe.
I know that’s the case.	Nkimanyi ekyo bwe kiri.
I am one of them.	Nze ndi omu.
He leaves as soon as.	Agenda amangu ddala nga...
That’s not really true.	Ekyo mu butuufu si kituufu.
Want to buy here?	Oyagala kugula wano?
Like he was a dog.	Nga bwe yali embwa.
Anyone can do something very difficult.	Omuntu yenna asobola okukola ekintu ekizibu ennyo.
And at that point,.	Era mu kiseera ekyo,...
That’s the problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu.
Anything.	Ekintu kyonna.
Where he had to be, what he had to do.	Gye yalina okubeera, kye yalina okukola.
But he can’t see.	Naye tasobola kulaba.
He has to know everything.	Alina okumanya buli kimu.
Why it is so important.	Lwaki kikulu nnyo.
All in one place.	Byonna mu kifo kimu.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
I'm going to work.	Ngenda kukola.
Consideration of.	Okulowooza ku.
No one wants to.	Tewali ayagala.
Not me, no.	Si nze, nedda.
And he's just a kid.	Era mwana muto yekka.
He is very happy with me.	Musanyufu nnyo nange.
I’m a guy.	Nze ndi ggaayi.
He has absolutely no chance of winning.	Talina n’akatono mukisa gwa kuwangula.
This isn't the issue here.	Eno si y'ensonga eri wano.
It was here, at the house.	Kyali wano, ku nnyumba.
He's going to come to you.	Agenda kujja gy'oli.
She was that beautiful.	Yali mulungi bw’atyo.
This is just a nice place to be.	Kino kifo kirungi kyokka okubeera.
In fact, I like to think otherwise.	Mu butuufu njagala nnyo okulowooza nti si bwe kiri.
He would be here, too.	Naye yandibadde wano, naye.
Everything was great.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi nnyo.
Not what you wanted at all.	Si kye wali oyagala n'akatono.
However, she looks great.	Kyokka, alabika bulungi nnyo.
He looks very young.	Alabika nga muto nnyo.
She was young and beautiful.	Yali muto era nga mulungi nnyo.
And he probably will.	Era osanga ajja kujja.
That’s very important up front.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo mu maaso.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
I have to know.	Nnina okumanya.
We can assume that.	Tusobola okulowooza nti.
But there is also power in doing so.	Naye era waliwo amaanyi mu kukola ekyo.
I am very dangerous.	Nze ndi wa bulabe nnyo.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
And he did that.	Era ekyo yakikola.
They are fine.	Bali bulungi.
I think he can.	Ndowooza asobola.
He couldn’t believe that was true.	Yali tayinza kukkiriza nti ekyo kyali kituufu.
Though he knows he can’t.	Wadde akimanyi nti tasobola.
That’s what this really was.	Ekyo kino ddala kye kyali.
Something that is difficult.	Ekintu ekizibu.
He couldn’t quite believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza bulungi.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
Everything, he knew, was right.	Buli kimu, yali akimanyi nti kyali kituufu.
I hope he says no.	Nsuubira agamba nti nedda.
Apparently he has no problem with this.	Kirabika kino talina buzibu bwonna.
You’ll see, it’s going to be good.	Ojja kulaba, kigenda kuba kirungi.
Here we are.	Wano we tuli.
He always told me so.	Bulijjo yang’amba bw’atyo.
I’m not feeling well.	Nze siri bulungi.
I don’t even want to do it.	Saagala na kukikola.
I know it myself.	Nze kennyini nkimanyi.
Everyone is happy.	Buli omu musanyufu.
Everyone knew everything.	Buli omu yali amanyi buli kimu.
It can happen early in the morning or at night.	Kiyinza okubaawo ku makya ennyo oba ekiro.
He knew he was so much more than that.	Yali akimanyi nti yali asinga nnyo ekyo.
This was good for me.	Kino kyali kirungi gyendi.
Indeed, we were.	Ddala, twali.
A lot actually.	Bingi mu butuufu.
This feature is very important for this system.	Ekintu kino kikulu nnyo ku nkola eno.
That’s not what we have today.	Ekyo si kye tulina leero.
I could easily be me too.	Nange kiyinza okuba nga kyangu okubeera nze.
And this is not uncommon.	Era kino si kya bulijjo.
You want to win.	Oyagala kuwangula.
Then he said.	Awo n’agamba nti.
A lot, but not really.	Bingi, naye si ddala.
effort.	amaanyi.
Nothing.	Tewali.
I just didn’t want to.	Nze nnali saagala kyokka.
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
That’s what we are.	Ekyo kye tuli.
Maybe that’s just one of these.	Mpozzi ekyo kyokka kye kimu ku bino.
Not in that case.	Si mu mbeera eyo.
And we’re fine.	Era tuli bulungi.
I don’t really know.	Simanyi ddala.
I didn’t know if that was a good thing or not.	Nnali simanyi oba ekyo kyali kintu kirungi oba nedda.
And himself, of course.	Era ye kennyini, ddala.
Nothing like this at home.	Tewali kintu nga kino awaka.
It is this place.	Kye kifo kino.
This is not very good.	Kino si kirungi nnyo.
It would have been my idea.	Kyandibadde kirowoozo kyange.
He just needs to play.	Yeetaaga kuzannya kyokka.
Everyone goes home.	Buli omu agenda eka.
He is a young child.	Ye mwana muto.
And he himself had many possessions.	Era ye kennyini yalina ebintu bingi.
He's coming here.	Ajja wano.
That's why we have a job.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tulina omulimu.
However, it is much worse than that.	Kyokka, kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I don’t know why.	Simanyi lwaki.
He wanted to come.	Yali ayagala kujja.
But someone had to do it.	Naye waliwo omuntu yalina okukikola.
Everyone wants money.	Buli omu ayagala ssente.
It may not work well.	Kiyinza obutakola bulungi.
It will never be there again.	Tekijja kuddamu kubeerawo.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
It’s not his thing.	Si kintu kye.
It was wonderful, he felt.	Kyali kirungi nnyo, bwe yawulira.
These are the things we’re going to do.	Bino bye tugenda okukola.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
No one says anything for a while.	Tewali ayogera kintu kyonna okumala akaseera.
I'll be fine.	Nja kuba bulungi.
I'll do just fine, now.	Nja kukola bulungi nnyo, kati.
This argument is obviously irrelevant.	Ensonga eno kirabika tewali nsonga.
He felt very happy.	Yawulira nga musanyufu nnyo.
All about everything.	Byonna ku buli kimu.
Maybe the whole office.	Mpozzi ofiisi yonna.
We need to know.	Tulina okumanya.
Even in the city, they were everywhere.	Ne mu kibuga, baali buli wamu.
No one downstairs.	Tewali muntu yenna wansi.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
I'm so glad you like it though.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti oyagala wadde.
It really doesn’t matter what you think.	Mazima ddala si kikulu ndowooza yo.
But he didn’t want to.	Naye yali tayagala.
It was just the way it was.	Kyali bwe kyali kyokka.
He loved to read.	Yali ayagala nnyo okusoma.
I don’t have anything to do.	Sirina kye nkola.
He is doing very well right now.	Akola bulungi nnyo mu kiseera kino.
Very nice home.	Awaka omulungi ennyo.
We certainly will.	Mazima ddala tujja kukikola.
He was asleep, he had to be.	Yali yeebase, yalina okuba nga yeebase.
He was very, very fast.	Yali wa bwangu nnyo nnyo.
I have it too.	Nze nange nnina.
That would be really bad.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi ddala.
That’s my opinion.	Eyo ndowooza yange.
Everyone knows it now.	Buli omu akimanyi kati.
What do you have to say about that?.	Ekyo olina okwogera ki?.
He was a man.	Yali musajja.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
He was very, very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo nnyo.
There is no office class here.	Tewali kibiina kya ofiisi wano.
I said we would find someone soon.	Nagamba nti tujja kufuna omuntu amangu ddala.
If he can.	Singa asobola.
He didn't want to, he thought.	Yali tayagala, bwe yalowooza.
And there’s nothing wrong with that.	Era ekyo tewali kibi kyonna.
And that’s fine with me.	Era ekyo kirungi gyendi.
We have to answer no.	Tulina okuddamu nti nedda.
I can'.	Nsobola'.
And the bus came here.	Era bbaasi yajja wano.
I'm not so sure that's true.	Sikakasa nnyo nti ekyo kituufu.
You have to do this.	Kino olina okukikola.
Either way you have a plan.	Mu ngeri yonna olina enteekateeka.
And he is.	Era ye.
One knows the other, he said.	Omu amanyi omulala, bwe yagambye.
In my own city.	Mu kibuga kyange.
I have things to do.	Nnina ebintu bye nnina okukola.
Why do you really want someone	Lwaki ddala oyagala omuntu
That is why this is so important.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki kino kikulu nnyo.
This is probably a bit important.	Kino osanga kikulu katono.
We don’t have anything to eat.	Tetulina kya kulya.
You have one.	Olina emu.
He has been very good.	Abadde mulungi nnyo.
I love it here.	Njagala nnyo wano.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
He was really good.	Yali mulungi ddala.
In fact, he is leaving now.	Mu butuufu kati agenda.
How exactly does he do that?	Ekyo ddala akikola atya?
I just want to go.	Njagala kugenda kyokka.
That was dangerous.	Ekyo kyali kya bulabe.
We both have it.	Ffembi tulina.
That's what he said he said.	Ekyo kye yagamba nti yayogera.
I can’t tell if it’s true.	Sisobola kumanya oba kituufu.
Getting a job.	Okufuna omulimu.
And when.	Era ddi.
He’s not going to do it.	Tagenda kukikola.
She was much prettier than her image.	Yali mulungi nnyo okusinga ekifaananyi kye.
I hoped to be everything she wanted.	Nnali nsuubira okuba buli kimu kye yali ayagala.
And neither will you.	Era naawe tojja kukikola.
And you will be childless for an hour.	Era ojja kumala essaawa emu nga tolina mwana.
But you can see.	Naye osobola okulaba.
But there they were.	Naye awo we baali.
This is not a problem at all.	Kino si kizibu n’akatono.
It was too dangerous, he knew.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo, yali akimanyi.
I was good at that.	Ekyo nnali mulungi.
I'll see what happens.	Nja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
I don’t feel anything.	Sirina kye mpulira.
Maybe he still was.	Mpozzi nga yali akyali.
But he knows one thing.	Naye amanyi ekintu kimu.
He wanted to do the same thing.	Yali ayagala okukola ekintu kye kimu.
We will talk to him.	Tujja kwogera naye.
My job is to.	Omulimu gwange.
That's what he said.	Ebyo bye yayogera.
I don’t belong there.	Nze siri wa eyo.
You are no child.	Ggwe tewali mwana muto.
There are so many.	Bingi nnyo.
As he saw in advance.	Nga bwe yalaba nga bukyali.
Ready to go?	Mwetegefu okugenda?
I can't work.	Sisobola kukola.
We can’t do the city now.	Tetusobola kukola kibuga kati.
This is a serious sin.	Kino kibi kya maanyi.
No, not at all.	Nedda, nedda ddala.
He should have gone.	Yandibadde agenda.
I’m not sure why.	Sikakasa lwaki.
And he was going to do it.	Era yali agenda kukikola.
On his way home, he saw a friend.	Bwe yali agenda eka, yalaba mukwano gwe.
The figure was clearly visible behind him.	Ekifaananyi kyali kirabika bulungi emabega we.
That was absolutely true.	Ekyo kyali kituufu ddala.
I'll talk to him soon.	Nja kwogera naye mu bbanga ttono.
I will come in the evening.	Nja kujja akawungeezi.
But it’s not you.	Naye si ggwe.
I can see a lot of that.	Nze nsobola okulaba bingi ebyo.
Obviously, it was difficult.	Kya lwatu nti kyali kizibu.
It was more complicated than that.	Kyali kizibu okusinga ekyo.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
Without any problems.	Nga tewali buzibu bwonna.
It’s not hard to see why.	Si kizibu kulaba nsonga lwaki.
But he seemed to be.	Naye yalabika nga bwe kiri.
I knew he must be young.	Namanya nti ateekwa okuba nga muto.
In many ways she was beautiful.	Mu ngeri nnyingi yali mulungi nnyo.
But I'm not.	Naye nze.
I don’t know what to do.	Nze simanyi kya kukola.
I don’t want anyone to know, actually.	Saagala muntu yenna kumanya, mu butuufu.
We cannot and must not do this.	Kino tetusobola era tetulina kukikola.
We can just live here.	Tusobola okubeera wano kyokka.
What is he doing now? 	Kati akola ki?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I really had no choice.	Mazima ddala nnali sirina kya kukola.
I have a plan.	Nze nnina enteekateeka.
But not like you.	Naye si nga ggwe.
Would that be a good practice?.	Eyo yandibadde nkola nnungi?.
This is not a good thing.	Kino si kirungi.
I just can’t.	Nze sisobola kyokka.
He is more than willing.	Asinga kuba mwetegefu.
He does a good job.	Akola omulimu mulungi.
But he didn’t know what time he had.	Naye yali tamanyi budde bwe yalina.
What he always wanted was right.	Kye yali ayagala bulijjo kyali kituufu.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
He is really very good.	Ddala mulungi nnyo.
I thought it was great.	Nalowooza nti kyali kirungi nnyo.
I’m going to make money anyway.	Ngenda kukola ssente mu ngeri yonna.
It’s hard to see.	Kizibu okulaba.
I’ll be fine now.	Nja kuba bulungi kati.
Making this movie was really good.	Okukola firimu eno kyali kirungi ddala.
You know when.	Omanyi ddi.
I’m afraid that’s the problem.	Ntya nti ekyo kye kizibu.
Maybe for a little while.	Mpozzi okumala akaseera katono.
I hope you love it!.	Nsuubira nti oyagala nnyo!.
You won’t believe it.	Tojja kukkiriza.
One for each faith.	Omu ku buli kukkiriza.
It’s not really bad.	Si kibi ddala.
For a long time, too.	Okumala ebbanga ddene, era.
I don’t want to be here.	Saagala kubeera wano.
I'm sure it's.	Nkakasa nti eri...
But that seems too complicated.	Naye ekyo kirabika nga kizibu nnyo.
That would have gone away.	Ekyo kyandibadde kigenda.
I love it though.	Njagala nnyo wadde.
I want to be good.	Njagala kubeera mulungi.
He wasn’t supposed to be there.	Yali talina kubeerawo.
It was, to me.	Yali, gyendi.
This isn’t a bad thing.	Kino si kibi.
I know what it is like.	Nze mmanyi bwe kiri.
He was so good now.	Yali mulungi nnyo kati.
He’s not necessarily dangerous, though.	Si kituufu nti wa bulabe, naye.
I'm going now.	Nze ngenda kati.
But we have no issue.	Naye tetulina nsonga yonna.
In a way, it was.	Mu ngeri emu, bwe kyali.
This in a very short time.	Kino mu bbanga ttono nnyo.
He always seems to be in a hurry.	Bulijjo alabika abeera mu bwangu.
I don’t have anything to do.	Sirina kye nkola.
But of course you have.	Naye ddala olina.
At this point, you don’t have to do anything about it.	Mu kiseera kino, tolina kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
I wasn’t sure which it was.	Nali sikakasa ki kye kyali.
I’m sure you know that.	Nkakasa nti ekyo okimanyi.
Or is it the case.	Oba bwe kiri.
I am a human being.	Nze ndi muntu.
I didn’t want to.	Nnali saagala.
It’s good in that sense.	Kirungi mu ngeri eyo.
And this was just that.	Era kino kyali ekyo kyokka.
You don’t have to do this.	Kino tolina kukikola.
Maybe it’s not.	Mpozzi si bwe kiri.
I think that would be a problem.	Ndowooza ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
You are the best.	Ggwe asinga obulungi.
You can’t do that.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola.
I'm not so sure about everything.	Sikakasa nnyo ku buli kimu.
He doesn’t want to come.	Tayagala kujja.
He can eat.	Asobola okulya.
Now he was fine.	Kati yali bulungi.
That is certainly true.	Ekyo mazima ddala kituufu.
One might say enough.	Omuntu ayinza okugamba nti amaze.
Easier said than done, you might say.	Kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola, oyinza okugamba.
I think that this was more of a reaction than a reaction.	Ndowooza nti kino kyali kya kuddamu okusinga okuddamu.
But there isn’t.	Naye tewali.
It was soon easy to see why.	Mu bbanga ttono kyali kyangu okulaba ensonga lwaki.
I actually know this.	Mu butuufu kino nkimanyi.
I'm so glad you're coming.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti ojja.
You can do this in advance.	Kino osobola okukikola nga bukyali.
No money, he said.	Tewali ssente, bwe yagambye.
Or not really.	Oba si ddala.
He does something he wants to do.	Akola ekintu ky’ayagala okukola.
That would be very common.	Ekyo kyandibadde kya bulijjo nnyo.
He could not speak for a moment.	Yali tasobola kwogera wadde akaseera katono.
I wanted that too.	Ekyo nnali njagala naye.
Just a moment here.	Akaseera katono wano.
You obviously don’t know what time it is.	Kya lwatu nti tomanyi ssaawa ki eno.
At that time you are not an artist.	Mu kiseera ekyo toli muyimbi.
It was a good thing to know.	Kyali kintu kirungi okumanya.
I was very happy about that.	Ekyo nnali musanyufu nnyo.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
It was the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu.
Not because of the class.	Si lwa nsonga ya kibiina.
It’s really easy.	Kyangu ddala.
This would be his room.	Kino kyandibadde kisenge kye.
It was a very difficult time.	Kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
What a thought.	Nga ndowooza ki.
But it will be costly.	Naye kijja kuba kya ssente nnyingi.
But you can see so much more.	Naye osobola okulaba bingi nnyo.
No talking to the guy.	Tewali kwogera na ggaayi oyo.
Or a car.	Oba mmotoka.
This is a real thing.	Kino kya ddala.
I’m not very good.	Nze siri mulungi nnyo.
I can see why.	Nsobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
But only for the moment.	Naye mu kiseera kino kyokka.
I don’t think much of his friends.	Sirowooza nnyo ku mikwano gye.
Each.	Buli -mu.
Getting to a certain point.	Okutuuka ku nsonga emu.
He wanted to make this film.	Yali ayagala kukola firimu eno.
I was a kid at the time.	Nali mwana muto mu kiseera ekyo.
We’ll wait until it goes down.	Tujja kulinda okutuusa nga kigenda wansi.
He told me that.	Yang’amba bw’atyo.
You know how they are.	Omanyi bwe bali.
He did the only thing he could think to do.	Yakola ekintu kyokka kye yali asobola okulowooza okukola.
I don’t know what it might be yet.	Simanyi kiyinza n’okutuusa kati.
To be with him.	Okubeera naye.
He did it.	Yakikola.
Do you need help? 	Oyagala buyambi?
It looks pretty good.	Kirabika kirungi nnyo.
He does the same thing.	Akola kye kimu.
I love this product.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
For what, he didn't know.	Ku lwa ki, yali tamanyi.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
This is a powerful one.	Kino kya maanyi.
He was, he is.	Yali, ali.
From there.	Okuva awo.
It's here right now.	Kiri wano mu kiseera kino.
I don’t even know.	Simanyi wadde.
Of course, he did see.	Kya lwatu nti yalaba ddala.
I wanted to live in that house.	Nnali njagala kubeera mu nnyumba eyo.
But, it’s not so easy to read.	Naye, si kyangu nnyo okusoma.
He just couldn’t.	Yali tasobola kyokka.
I can’t speak for everyone though.	Sisobola kwogera ku lwa buli muntu wadde.
I don’t want to do that again either.	Ekyo nange saagala kuddamu kukikola.
I don’t know how to do that.	Ekyo simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukikola.
We can do it ourselves.	Ffe tusobola okukikola.
There is no place as such.	Tewali kifo nga bwe kiri.
The dog was not very interested.	Embwa eyo yali tayagala nnyo.
And he knows you can do it.	Era akimanyi nti osobola okukikola.
We should address the problem early.	Tusaanidde okukola ku kizibu ekyo nga bukyali.
He says it isn’t.	Agamba nti si bwe kiri.
He thinks a lot and doesn’t think at all.	Alowooza nnyo era talowooza n’akatono.
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
You know that's something like us.	Okimanyi ekyo kintu nga ffe.
And he does it.	Era akikola.
From his room.	Okuva mu kisenge kye.
Like him, this was going to happen.	Nga ye, kino kyali kigenda kubaawo.
He could see.	Yali asobola okulaba.
Everyone went really really well.	Buli omu yagenda bulungi ddala ddala.
Everyone had a role to play.	Buli omu yalina omulimu gwe yalina.
I really don’t care.	Nze ddala sifaayo.
This is where he lived.	Wano we yali abeera.
If only something.	Singa ekintu kyokka.
Maybe he did.	Mpozzi bwe yakola.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
I will be the best wife.	Nja kuba mukyala asinga obulungi.
He will know.	Ajja kumanya.
You’re in trouble.	Oli mu buzibu.
This was going on.	Kino kyali kigenda mu maaso.
Another had it.	Omulala yalina.
I was in his house.	Nnali mu nnyumba ye.
He wants to win right away.	Ayagala kuwangula mangu ddala.
But he was curious.	Naye yali ayagala okumanya.
He’s going to win, not really.	Agenda kuwangula, si ddala.
Not being nice right now.	Si kubeera kirungi mu kiseera kino.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
I think it’s a great practice.	Ndowooza nti nkola nnungi nnyo.
It won’t go anywhere.	Tekijja kugenda yonna.
This is an opportunity.	Guno mukisa.
In your own house.	Mu nnyumba yo.
We have a lot of money.	Tulina ssente nnyingi.
That was his thing.	Ekyo kye kyali ekintu kye.
We are so good together.	Tuli bulungi nnyo nga tuli wamu.
I have to get to the bottom.	Nnina okutuuka wansi.
That was what was in him.	Ekyo kye kyali mu ye.
Very good for you.	Kirungi nnyo gyoli.
Like, me, today.	Nga, nze, leero.
But surely he would do that anyway.	Naye mazima ddala ekyo yandikoze mu ngeri yonna.
No one was sleeping soundly.	Tewali yali yeebase bulungi.
I’m almost sick.	Nze kumpi ndi mulwadde.
That was all he expected.	Ekyo kye yali asuubira kyokka.
And it was almost simultaneous.	Era kumpi kyali kiseera kya kimu.
He must be the same.	Alina okuba nga bwe kiri.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
I was ordinary.	Nali wa bulijjo.
What is that?	Ekyo kye ki?
No, no, my friend.	Nedda nedda mukwano gwange.
For the money.	Ku ssente.
And then we .	Era awo ffe .
He is the only guy.	Ye ggaayi yekka.
It was worse than he had imagined.	Kyali kibi nnyo okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
I don’t know, maybe it was just something he could do.	Simanyi, mpozzi kyali kintu kyokka kye yali asobola okukola.
I was already fine.	Nali dda bulungi.
He is young but very strong.	Muto naye wa maanyi nnyo.
But he couldn’t.	Naye yali tasobola.
Everyone.	Buli omu.
I think it looks really good so far.	Ndowooza ddala kirabika bulungi okutuuka wano.
He knows his phone.	Amanyi essimu ye.
He doesn't want to talk.	Tayagala kwogera.
Or, well.	Oba, bulungi.
I'm going to.	Nze njagala.
Quick, quick.	Amangu, amangu.
My best friend.	Mukwano gwange asinga.
That’s just true.	Ekyo kituufu kyokka.
I don’t want to spend the evening alone.	Saagala kumala akawungeezi nga ndi nzekka.
He couldn’t see.	Yali tasobola kulaba.
You won’t even love.	Tojja na kwagala.
That’s what he hoped would happen.	Ekyo kye yali asuubira nti kijja kubaawo.
And he is really happy.	Era ddala musanyufu.
He was very willing.	Yali mwetegefu nnyo.
I love being with you too.	Nze nange njagala nnyo okubeera naawe.
He is my best friend’s younger brother.	Ye muto wa mukwano gwange asinga.
I’m fine with this.	Nze kino ndi bulungi.
I am really really not myself.	Nze ddala ddala siri nze kennyini.
No you don’t have to.	Nedda tolina kukola.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
I can’t even see what it is.	Sisobola na kulaba kye kiri.
He's not good.	Si mulungi.
I have to know.	Nnina okumanya.
He will never do this again.	Kino tajja kuddamu kukikola.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I was in trouble.	Nnali mu buzibu.
Something is going on.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
And so he should be.	Era bw’atyo yandibadde.
He's been here before.	Abadde wano emabegako.
It’s not just that.	Si ekyo kyokka.
I haven’t got anything.	Nze sirina kye nfunye.
Good with me anyway.	Kirungi nange mu ngeri yonna.
I probably won’t.	Oboolyawo sijja kukikola.
This will not work.	Kino tekijja kukola.
Not for long, though.	Kyokka si lwa bbanga ddene.
No one did it.	Tewali yakikola.
I don’t want that to be me.	Ekyo saagala kubeera nze.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
No, he thought.	Nedda, bwe yalowooza.
Having his own money.	Okubeera ne ssente ze.
But no one says anything.	Naye tewali ayogera kintu kyonna.
I’m with you on that.	Nze ndi naawe ku ekyo.
She has.	Ye alina.
This will be a real thing.	Kino kijja kuba kintu kya ddala.
Or, no, that’s not true.	Oba, nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
None next week.	Tewali wiiki ejja.
He is very aware of this fact.	Amanyi nnyo ensonga eno.
He does very well with her.	Akola bulungi nnyo naye.
Why would he do it.	Lwaki yandikoze.
I don’t want to see anything.	Saagala kulaba kintu kyonna.
No one knows but me.	Tewali amanyi okuggyako nze.
There is one thing.	Waliwo ekintu kimu.
I just don’t know.	Nze simanyi kyokka.
But it was very difficult.	Naye kyali kizibu nnyo.
It’s not a good thing.	Si kintu kirungi.
. . . .	.
And it’s good.	Era kirungi.
There was something he expected to see happen.	Waliwo kye yali asuubira okulaba nga kigenda mu maaso.
I don’t know what to do from here.	Simanyi kya kukola okuva wano.
It is truly a powerful moment.	Mazima ddala kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
He came for dinner.	Yajja okulya ekyeggulo.
It will be very dangerous.	Kijja kuba kya bulabe nnyo.
He was very lonely.	Yali yekka nnyo.
He is a good friend.	Ye mukwano mulungi.
And he did that.	Era ekyo yakikola.
That's the whole thing.	Ekyo kye kintu kyonna.
But it’s not his time, it’s not his time.	Naye si kye kiseera kye, si kye kiseera kye.
But not this group.	Naye si kibiina kino.
Maybe it was like back then.	Mpozzi nga bwe kyali mu kiseera ekyo.
How did he do it?	Yakikola atya?
That’s not me.	Oyo si nze.
He didn’t want to drive.	Yali tayagala kuvuga mmotoka.
It’s in the point.	Kiri mu nsonga.
You can't come.	Tosobola kujja.
That’s not for me to say.	Ekyo si kyange okwogera.
Let him do what he wants.	Akole ky’ayagala.
And still nothing.	Era n’okutuusa kati tewali kintu kyonna.
That’s up to you.	Ekyo kiri gy’oli.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
I have no idea what to expect.	Sirina kirowoozo ku kiki kye nsuubira.
But he spoke anyway.	Naye yayogera mu ngeri yonna.
And, that’s great.	Era, ekyo kirungi nnyo.
Maybe that’s a good thing.	Mpozzi ekyo kirungi.
It's not yours.	Si wa ggwe.
I’m just there like .	Nze ndi awo kyokka nga .
However, it is not a good idea.	Kyokka, si kirowoozo kirungi.
But the picture.	Naye ekifaananyi.
I don’t know why this is happening.	Simanyi lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso.
But not a child.	Naye si mwana.
It is my opinion.	Ye ndowooza yange.
Not like he should have.	Si nga bwe yandibadde.
I want to be like him.	Njagala kubeera nga ye.
He had a problem.	Yalina ekizibu.
And here we are face to face.	Era wano tuli maaso ku maaso.
Nothing is right, nothing is as it seems.	Tewali kituufu, tewali kiri nga bwe kirabika.
And it probably isn’t.	Era osanga si bwe kiri.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
I have no idea what to expect.	Sirina kye mmanyi kye nsuubira.
And that was very difficult for me.	Era ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo gyendi.
You're good to me, you know.	Oli mulungi gyendi, omanyi.
We are both fine.	Ffembi tuli bulungi.
Not everyone thinks this is a good idea.	Si buli muntu nti kino kirowoozo kirungi.
I am a very loving person.	Ndi muntu ayagala nnyo.
Or making dinner.	Oba okukola ekyeggulo.
The food is on the floor.	Emmere eri wansi.
That’s actually a little more complicated.	Ekyo mu butuufu kizibu nnyo katono.
I'm getting a lot further.	Nze ngenda ngenda mu maaso nnyo.
He spoke for a long time.	Yayogera okumala ebbanga ddene.
And it was the same thing.	Era nga kye kimu.
Same with last week.	Kye kimu ne wiiki ewedde.
We can’t go anywhere today.	Tetusobola kugenda yonna leero.
He didn't know what to say.	Yali tamanyi kya kwogera.
A lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi.
That’s where it was.	Eyo gye kyali.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
This will be difficult.	Kino kijja kuba kizibu.
But not nearly as good.	Naye si kumpi nga kirungi.
I couldn’t even believe it.	Nnali sisobola na kukkiriza.
Almost everyone.	Kumpi buli muntu yenna.
And now it was here.	Era kati kyali wano.
And we have work to do.	Era tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
This is the problem.	Kino kye kizibu.
Every single week.	Buli wiiki emu.
She couldn't believe what he was saying, she said.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza bye yali ayogera, bwe yagambye.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
I'm not you.	Si nze ggwe.
Very good for him.	Mulungi nnyo ku ye.
He doesn’t have much money.	Talina ssente nnyingi.
You should know better than that.	Olina okumanya okusinga ekyo.
I thought he had been so happy.	Nalowooza nti yali abadde musanyufu nnyo.
He is my brother.	Ye muganda wange.
You have what you wanted.	Olina kye wali oyagala.
He has been very good to me.	Abadde mulungi nnyo gyendi.
And he knew it was true.	Era yali akimanyi nti kituufu.
Now, of course he’s going to say that.	Kati, ddala agenda kwogera ekyo.
I am ready, he said.	Ndi mwetegefu, bwe yagambye.
But it is everywhere.	Naye kiri buli wamu.
I hope you can do it.	Nsuubira nti osobola okukikola.
He’s just trying to do the right thing.	Agezaako kukola kituufu kyokka.
It is very difficult to make money.	Kizibu nnyo okufuna ssente.
Not that, either.	Si ekyo, era.
Either way, you know.	Mu ngeri yonna, omanyi.
And he is with me.	Era ye nange.
Not too bad, really.	Si kibi nnyo, ddala.
This is not my town.	Kino si kye kibuga kyange.
I don’t know when that is.	Simanyi ddi ekyo lwe kiri.
He could have helped.	Yandibadde asobola okuyamba.
To be with him.	Okubeera naye.
I think this may be the problem.	Ndowooza kino kiyinza okuba nga kye kizibu.
Now the problem.	Kati ekizibu.
He probably should have mentioned that room.	Oboolyawo yandibadde ayogera ku kisenge ekyo.
At this point, however, no one was going anywhere.	Kyokka mu kiseera kino tewali yali agenda yonna.
Now you’re moving on.	Kati ogenda mu maaso.
That would be right.	Ekyo kyandibadde kituufu.
He is not well today.	Tali bulungi leero.
Someone else will too.	Omuntu omulala naye ajja kukikola.
For the sake of	Ku lwa .
What time is it?	Ssaawa mmeka?
Nothing is happening.	Tewali kigenda mu maaso.
I just don't know how to do it.	Nze simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukikola.
He is just the underdog right now.	Ye muntu ali wansi yekka mu kiseera kino.
He couldn't see anything from here.	Yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna okuva wano.
Obviously it would be.	Kya lwatu nti kyandibadde.
I won’t try this week.	Sijja kugezaako wiiki eno.
It’s a party town.	Kibuga kya mbaga.
He obviously knows better.	Kya lwatu nti amanyi bulungi.
It’s a very real thing.	Kintu kituufu nnyo.
Everyone was happy.	Buli omu yali musanyufu.
It matters what the reason is.	Kikulu ensonga ki.
He knows how to drive.	Amanyi okuvuga.
He did what he did.	Yakola ekyo kye yakola.
I was afraid of this.	Kino nnali ntya.
And he didn’t know.	Era yali tamanyi.
I really wanted to do this.	Kino nnali njagala nnyo okukola.
You have it yourself.	Ggwe kennyini olina.
It's a bad thing.	Kibi kibi.
I know this to be the truth.	Kino nkimanyi nti kye kituufu.
He had a lot.	Yalina bingi.
This is quick and easy.	Kino kyangu era kyangu.
Here we have a problem.	Wano tulina obuzibu.
He thought maybe it was as he said.	Yalowooza nti osanga bwe kyali nga bwe yagamba.
You know it, too.	Ggwe era okimanyi.
Everything was fine.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi.
I am not the police.	Si nze poliisi.
You can’t say anything.	Tosobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
But, he loves to talk.	Naye, ayagala nnyo okwogera.
He could have done this.	Kino yandibadde asobola okukikola.
I like to go swimming.	Njagala nnyo okugenda okuwuga.
You know what we are, now.	Omanyi kye tuli, kati.
Not that this is necessarily a bad thing.	Si nti kino kituufu nti kintu kibi.
We’re almost here.	Tuli kumpi wano.
Leaving the house.	Okuva mu nnyumba.
And he wanted to do it right.	Era yali ayagala kukikola bulungi.
It will be coming soon.	Kijja kujja mu bbanga ttono.
Everyone wants to be the best though.	Buli omu ayagala kubeera asinga wadde.
It’s not just that.	Si ekyo kyokka.
He felt better now.	Yawulira bulungi kati.
Everyone loves it!.	Buli omu ayagala nnyo!.
It was a powerful place.	Kyali kifo kya maanyi nnyo.
I knew it wasn’t a good idea to watch the movie.	Namanya nti si kirungi okulaba firimu eyo.
This is certainly true.	Kino mazima ddala kituufu.
This is very easy to do.	Kino kyangu nnyo okukola.
What is it that is.	Kiki kye kiri.
Here you go.	Wano ogenda.
I can’t wait to see everything.	Siyinza kulinda kulaba buli kimu.
I'll come.	Nja kujja.
Not that it matters.	Si nti kikulu.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
You know what’s going to happen.	Omanyi ekigenda okubaawo.
It was the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu.
His attitude was normal.	Endowooza ye yali ya bulijjo.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
It’s hard to imagine now.	Kizibu okulowooza kati.
I thought it was normal.	Nalowooza nti kyali kya bulijjo.
But now there is a problem.	Naye kati waliwo obuzibu.
You don’t have to come back here.	Tolina kudda wano.
It was really good.	Yali nnungi ddala.
For the morning.	Ku lwa makya.
But we were.	Naye ffe twali.
I am a person of faith.	Ndi muntu wa kukkiriza.
Maybe he's the only good one.	Mpozzi nga ye yekka omulungi.
That’s very important, you know.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo, omanyi.
It is very important to do something.	Kikulu nnyo okukola ekintu.
I’m going to do this thing.	Ekintu kino ngenda kukikola.
But he was also.	Naye era ye yali.
That picture was beautiful.	Ekifaananyi ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
If this.	Singa kino.
He was my best friend.	Yali mukwano gwange nnyo.
That’s what everybody had.	Ekyo buli muntu kye yalina.
He came to me.	Yajja gyendi.
She wanted him to know that she wanted to be his wife.	Yali ayagala okumanya nti ayagala kubeera mukyala we.
None of my business, really.	Tewali nsonga yange yonna, ddala.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
He is not really sick.	Mu butuufu si mulwadde.
He said no, no he couldn't do that.	Yagamba nti nedda, nedda ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
He often does it.	Atera okukikola.
He certainly didn’t want to be in the group.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala kubeera mu kibiina.
I want to see his picture.	Njagala okulaba ekifaananyi kye.
I could only imagine the scene.	Nnali nsobola okulowooza ku kifo ekyo.
And right now we seem to be there.	Era mu kiseera kino kirabika tuli awo.
This is not a group activity.	Guno si mulimu gwa kibiina.
That doesn’t matter.	Ekyo si kikulu.
I want that so badly.	Ekyo njagala kibi nnyo.
He watched the entire movie.	Yalaba firimu yonna.
This is true for money.	Kino kituufu ku ssente.
But no one knows.	Naye tewali amanyi.
He would love it.	Yandiyagadde nnyo.
You know you want to.	Omanyi nti oyagala.
That’s the problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu.
He felt better now that he was home.	Yawulira bulungi kati nga ali waka.
I won’t be ready.	Sijja kuba mwetegefu.
Indeed, in many ways, it is very unusual.	Mazima ddala, mu ngeri nnyingi, si kya bulijjo nnyo.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
I'm sorry, he said.	Nsonyiwa, bwe yagamba.
I’m not going to do that.	Ekyo sigenda kukikola.
And it’s not easy.	Era si kyangu.
He must have loved it.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali ayagala nnyo.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka, kino si kituufu.
Now was not the moment.	Kati si kye kyali akaseera.
We are very close to him.	Tuli kumpi nnyo naye.
You’ve been really nice.	Obadde mulungi ddala.
He was very, very scared.	Yali atya nnyo nnyo.
Until it was.	Okutuusa bwe kyali.
This is just one thing.	Kino kintu kimu kyokka.
To say the least.	Okugamba nti.
I won’t be here.	Sijja kubeera wano.
It was time for me to go too.	Kyali kiseera nange okugenda.
And there is definitely no time to be young.	Era mazima ddala tewali kiseera kya kubeera muto.
I really didn’t know what to say.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kwogera.
He was a very nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
I have to act fast.	Nnina okukola amangu.
And now we both have so much.	Era kati ffembi tulina bingi nnyo.
I don’t know the answer.	Simanyi kya kuddamu.
Maybe he was.	Mpozzi nga yali...
Or read about it.	Oba okusoma ku nsonga eyo.
It won’t quite suffice now.	Tekijja kumala nnyo kati.
However, it wasn’t.	Kyokka, si bwe kyali.
Until last week.	Okutuusa wiiki ewedde.
I don’t know too much about that time.	Simanyi bingi nnyo ku kiseera ekyo.
I love dogs.	Njagala nnyo embwa.
It doesn’t really matter.	Si kikulu nnyo.
It is a very difficult place.	Kifo kizibu nnyo.
I don’t know anyone like that.	Simanyi muntu nga oyo.
And he is the one.	Era ye ye.
He had no idea how he knew this.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku ngeri gye yali amanyi kino.
All of us together.	Ffenna nga tuli wamu.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
Everything will work.	Buli kimu kijja kukola.
Tonight would be good.	Ekiro kya leero kyandibadde kirungi.
That wasn’t him.	Oyo si ye yali.
He probably does.	Oboolyawo akikola.
Yeah, no.	Ye nedda.
You can do that.	Ekyo osobola okukola.
Nobody wanted this thing.	Tewali yali ayagala kintu kino.
He was in office only a short time.	Yali mu ofiisi akaseera katono ddala.
I could barely work.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kukola.
My father would be in the process.	Taata yandibadde mu nkola.
He was like a father he would have loved to have.	Yali nga taata gwe yandibadde ayagala nnyo okubeera naye.
He loved the guy.	Yali ayagala nnyo ggaayi oyo.
That was good, he thought.	Ekyo kyali kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
I don’t know why exactly.	Simanyi lwaki ddala.
And it is, of course.	Era bwe kiri, ddala.
I’m pretty good now.	Nze kati ndi mulungi nnyo.
You have to make money.	Olina okukola ssente.
He is here tonight.	Ali wano ekiro kino.
You are my problem.	Ggwe kizibu kyange.
It will be here.	Kijja kuba wano.
And that’s a bad thing.	Era ekyo kintu kibi.
Tomorrow morning, baby.	Enkya ku makya, mwana.
He agreed but couldn’t work.	Yakkiriza naye nga tasobola kukola.
It is very true also.	Kituufu nnyo era.
This attitude is good.	Endowooza eno nnungi.
What is going on? 	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I think this is true.	Ndowooza kino kituufu.
Probably just me.	Oboolyawo nze nzekka.
No one is going to know.	Tewali agenda kumanya.
You know the plan.	Omanyi enteekateeka.
I was doing the same thing to my father.	Nze nali nkola ekintu kye kimu ku taata.
But there he was, the same.	Naye awo we yali, kye kimu.
It’s time to do it.	Kye kiseera okukikola.
I knew better now.	Nze nnali mmanyi bulungi kati.
I have plenty of time.	Nnina obudde bungi.
He was ready for this.	Kino yali mwetegefu.
I know he can.	Nkimanyi nti asobola.
That was it, of course.	Ekyo kye kyali, ddala.
Really?	Kituufu?
Was that too easy?.	Ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo?.
I need everyone to do their job.	Nze nneetaaga buli muntu okukola omulimu gwe.
I was sure of that.	Ekyo nnali nkakasa.
Very good indeed.	Kirungi nnyo ddala.
No, he shouldn’t.	Nedda, tasaanidde kukikola.
But he couldn’t wait.	Naye yali tasobola kulinda.
Really, really good.	Ddala, ddala kirungi.
Why him? 	Lwaki ye?
In the meantime he should have stayed at home.	Mu kiseera kino yandibadde abeera waka.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
I'll get one.	Nja kufuna emu.
He was asleep.	Yali yeebase.
He has no friends here.	Talina mikwano wano.
We will do it anyway.	Tujja kukikola mu ngeri yonna.
Right now, it doesn’t seem to matter to me.	Mu kiseera kino, kirabika si kikulu gyendi.
That’s a very dangerous thing to do.	Ekyo kintu kya bulabe nnyo okukola.
He was probably in the car.	Oboolyawo yali mu mmotoka.
That's why he's here.	Y'ensonga lwaki ali wano.
And we are lucky.	Era tuli ba mukisa.
He was a person like me.	Yali muntu nga nze.
It won’t be a school.	Tekijja kuba ssomero.
I hope to talk to you again soon.	Nsuubira okuddamu okwogera naawe mu bbanga ttono.
He had to beat this.	Yalina okukuba kino.
It won’t be easy.	Tekijja kuba kyangu.
However, it is not the same thing.	Kyokka, si kintu kye kimu.
And we certainly are.	Era mazima ddala tuli.
Being a human being.	Okubeera omuntu.
Do you live in this place right now?	Ggwe abeera mu kifo kino mu kiseera kino?
For a moment, he was ready.	Okumala akaseera katono, yali mwetegefu.
You come to my place for dinner.	Ojja ku kifo kyange okulya ekyeggulo.
We have a lot to do.	Tulina bingi bye tulina okukola.
He wasn’t dangerous.	Yali si wa bulabe.
I wasn’t sure if it would happen.	Nnali sikakasa oba kijja kubaawo.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
He wants to talk to you.	Ayagala kwogera naawe.
That’s actually quite complicated.	Ekyo mu butuufu kizibu nnyo.
You have to know.	Olina okumanya.
Not that he could do much.	Si nti yali asobola okukola bingi.
This seems to be true.	Kino kirabika nga kituufu.
Everything seems so serious.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kya maanyi nnyo.
I think it’s a beautiful thing.	Ndowooza nti kintu kirungi nnyo.
I have what we need.	Nnina bye twetaaga.
Anyone has the same problem.	Omuntu yenna alina ekizibu kye kimu.
I know, me too.	Nze mmanyi, nze nange.
It is in excellent condition.	Kiri mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
He was having trouble finding a job.	Yali alina obuzibu okufuna omulimu.
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
No one is visible.	Tewali alabika.
I thought maybe.	Nalowooza nti osanga.
He wanted to go, now.	Yali ayagala okugenda, kati.
It may be his idea.	Kiyinza okuba nga kye kirowoozo kye.
I love his attitude.	Njagala nnyo endowooza ye.
I hope that’s not the case for you.	Nsuubira nti ekyo si bwe kiri gy’oli.
You you.	Ggwe ggwe.
I can think of one way.	Nsobola okulowooza ku ngeri emu.
He came to me.	Yajja gyendi.
It is best to arrive early.	Kirungi okutuuka amangu.
And it was powerful.	Era kyali kya maanyi.
Reading is nothing.	Okusoma si kintu kyonna.
Here it is the same.	Wano kye kimu.
He says he knows it.	Agamba nti akimanyi.
But he was very much like that.	Naye yali bw’atyo nnyo.
It can happen here.	Kiyinza okubaawo wano.
We need to go anyway.	Twetaaga okugenda mu ngeri yonna.
He is a very nice person.	Ye muntu mulungi nnyo.
You could do it all at the same time.	Oyinza okukikola byonna mu kiseera kye kimu.
Or perhaps he could.	Oba oboolyawo yali asobola.
And this is the same thing.	Era kino kye kimu.
He wanted that very much.	Ekyo yali ayagala nnyo.
That was him now.	Oyo ye yali kati.
We were alone in the room.	Twali ffekka mu kisenge.
I thought you knew that too.	Nalowooza nti naawe ekyo okimanyi.
I didn’t know what to do.	Nnali simanyi kya kukola.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
It may work and it may not.	Kiyinza okukola era kiyinza obutakola.
Not really very good, but really bad.	Si ddala kirungi nnyo, naye ddala kibi nnyo.
But that’s just us.	Naye ekyo ffe ffekka.
You can’t do anything.	Tosobola kukola kintu kyonna.
He would like it that way.	Yandiyagadde bw’atyo.
I doubt if they are on him.	Nbuusabuusa oba bali ku ye.
It was something I knew.	Kyali kintu kye mmanyi.
That's why he's here.	Y'ensonga lwaki ali wano.
I have a plan.	Nnina enteekateeka.
But he would work.	Naye yandikoze.
Maybe it was what he wanted.	Mpozzi kye yali ayagala.
No woman to help.	Tewali mukyala kuyamba.
It was the same everywhere.	Buli wamu kyali kye kimu.
To think that one was young, when he was with him .	Okulowooza nti omuntu yali muto, bwe yali naye .
I feel hungry.	Mpulira enjala.
I feel comfortable.	Mpulira nga ndi bulungi.
No, he didn't know what he was doing back in town.	Nedda, yali tamanyi kye yali akola emabega mu kibuga.
He was willing, and he could.	Yali mwetegefu, era yali asobola.
I am not that person.	Si nze omuntu oyo.
What kind of person was he?	Yali muntu wa ngeri ki?
But not close.	Naye si kumpi.
And we’ll do it right soon.	Era tujja kukikola bulungi mu bbanga ttono.
That’s an issue, of course.	Eyo nsonga, ddala.
That's not the point at all here.	Eyo si y'ensonga n'akatono wano.
And the job is the job.	Era omulimu gwe mulimu.
It’s the same as you were.	Kye kimu nga bwe wali.
I guess we’ll see what happens.	Ntebereza tujja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
Not that he expected anything.	Si nti yali asuubira kyonna.
That’s dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe.
Probably more than that.	Oboolyawo okusinga ekyo.
He was very curious.	Yali ayagala nnyo okumanya.
Right, you said.	Kituufu, bwe wagamba.
I know it’s time to speak up.	Nkimanyi nti kye kiseera okwogera.
And that’s not a bad thing.	Era ekyo si kibi.
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
I couldn’t do without it.	Nnali sisobola kukola nga sirina.
You truly don’t have to live with me alone.	Mu mazima tolina kubeera nange wekka.
I thought she needed to get help.	Nnalowooza nti yali yeetaaga okufuna obuyambi.
He did nothing but read his book.	Tewali kye yakola okuggyako okusoma ekitabo kye.
This is what he expected.	Kino kye yali asuubira.
This is actually a real place.	Mu butuufu kino kifo kya ddala.
You can.	Osobola.
It's what 'I' do.	Kye 'nze' kye nkola.
This is good in theory.	Kino kirungi mu ndowooza.
He knows that.	Ekyo akimanyi.
You are here now.	Oli wano kati.
She is not a woman.	Si ye mukyala.
This is not the case though.	Kino si bwe kiri wadde.
We are just ourselves.	Ffe ffekka ffekka.
I'll wait with him.	Nja kulinda naye.
Certainly not.	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
I don’t have a car.	Nze sirina mmotoka.
You can’t get a job again.	Tosobola kuddamu kufuna mulimu.
Why, we can do anything.	Lwaki, tusobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
In a sense.	Mu ngeri emu.
What, it's hard to say.	Kiki, kizibu okwogera.
I really wasn’t sure.	Mazima ddala nnali sikakasa.
So far everything was normal.	N’okutuusa kati buli kimu kyali kya bulijjo.
But he is not alone.	Naye si ye yekka.
I’ve been thinking about it too.	Nze nange mbadde ndowooza ku nsonga eyo.
They were like him.	Baali nga ye.
You know what that was like.	Omanyi ekyo bwe kyali.
No one was here.	Tewali muntu yenna yali wano.
He is a good man.	Ye musajja mulungi.
I will be near you.	Nja kuba kumpi naawe.
He did a good job of it.	Yakikola omulimu omulungi.
You are very happy.	Oli musanyufu nnyo.
Actually, anything with him.	Mu butuufu, ekintu kyonna naye.
I won’t be here in the morning.	Sijja kubeera wano ku makya.
Now you know the reason.	Kati omanyi ensonga.
Let me think about it.	Ka nze ndowooza.
But it seems no one will.	Naye kirabika tewali muntu yenna ajja kukikola.
As it really was.	Nga bwe kyali ddala.
Perhaps that might work.	Oboolyawo ekyo kiyinza okukola.
Or they were.	Oba baali.
I don't know what.	Simanyi ki.
He went with her to see.	Yagenda naye okulaba.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
He is very powerful.	Wa maanyi nnyo.
as beautiful as he was.	nga bwe yali omulungi.
In that case .	Mu mbeera eyo .
Anyone but him.	Omuntu yenna okuggyako ye.
You can tell where it is but not where it is going.	Osobola okumanya gye kiri naye si gye kigenda.
He is the best for everyone.	Ye asinga obulungi eri buli muntu.
He felt comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi.
I'm thinking about here.	Nze ndowooza ku wano.
It’s not too hard really.	Si kizibu nnyo ddala.
How long do you think it takes to get there?.	Olowooza ku ssaawa mmeka okutuuka eyo?.
Driving is very dangerous.	Okuvuga mmotoka kya bulabe nnyo.
Just what he needed.	Kye yali yeetaaga kyokka.
In many cases.	Mu mbeera nnyingi.
I want to see.	Njagala kulaba.
This is what it is.	Kino kye kiri.
But it’s time to move on.	Naye kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
The fastest person to do something.	Omuntu asinga okukola ekintu mu bwangu.
But she was a practical woman.	Naye yali mukyala wa nkola.
I won’t even eat.	Sijja wadde okulya.
I thought about my position.	Nalowooza ku kifo kyange.
Yeah, it’s the same.	Ye, kye kimu.
There is no room for that here.	Ekyo wano tewali kifo kyonna.
Or a plan.	Oba enteekateeka.
Everything in perspective.	Buli kimu mu ndowooza.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
He said that he had.	Yagamba nti yalina.
We’ll know soon enough.	Tujja kumanya mu bbanga ttono.
Were you there?.	Ggwe wali?.
We need things to do in that situation.	Twetaaga ebintu bye tulina okukola mu mbeera eyo.
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
That's why he won't.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki tajja kukikola.
But you would love it.	Naye wandyagadde nnyo.
But in this case, it’s absolutely true.	Naye mu mbeera eno, kituufu ddala.
I don’t care about myself.	Sifaayo ku nze kennyini.
Maybe that's it.	Mpozzi ekyo.
I didn’t know anything.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi.
He was always like that.	Bulijjo yali bw’atyo.
It would be the right thing to do.	Kyandibadde kituufu okukola.
He was done that night.	Yali amaze ekiro ekyo.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
This is easy.	Kino kyangu.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
He thought he knew.	Yalowooza nti amanyi.
He would have done it.	Yandikoze.
My job is to.	Omulimu gwange.
I want it here.	Njagala wano.
If he had, he might not have gone.	Singa yalina, yandiba nga tagenda.
He doesn’t need one.	Teyeetaaga emu.
Now we either move on, or else.	Kati oba tugenda mu maaso, oba si ekyo.
I have to go.	Nnina okugenda.
There is really nothing to do.	Mu butuufu tewali kya kukola.
He knew he was safe then.	Yali akimanyi nti mu kiseera ekyo yali talina bulabe.
Today, , a lot of money.	Leero, , ssente nnyingi.
He was doing well.	Yali akola bulungi.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
I have him.	Nze nnina ye.
But that is not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu.
To have him down, we need.	Okubeera naye wansi, twetaaga.
He had to give up on this thing.	Yalina okuva ku kintu kino.
But they are there.	Naye bali awo.
But it looks good.	Naye kirabika bulungi.
Not me though.	Si nze wadde.
I want to be here.	Njagala kubeera wano.
However, it is not too difficult.	Kyokka si kizibu nnyo.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
I’m sorry to see you go.	Nsonyiwa okulaba nga ogenda.
He is still very sick.	Akyali mulwadde nnyo.
That had to be what we needed to do.	Ekyo kyalina okuba nga kye twali twetaaga okukola.
Very nice!.	Kirungi nnyo!.
He was powerless.	Yali talina maanyi.
You're at home.	Oli waka.
But he couldn’t, not yet.	Naye yali tasobola, nga tannaba.
And you will be good too.	Era naawe ojja kuba mulungi.
He wants evil.	Ayagala kibi.
But he’s not ready for the job.	Naye si mwetegefu kukola mulimu.
It’s not like you’re sick.	Si nga ggwe oli mulwadde.
He knows, of course.	Amanyi, ddala.
This setting will only work for a limited time.	Enteekateeka eno ejja kukola okumala akaseera katono.
We are very much.	Ffe tuli nnyo.
Maybe he did.	Mpozzi bwe yakola.
He wanted to see.	Yali ayagala kulaba.
Like a movie.	Nga firimu.
More than it is now.	Okusinga bwe kiri kati.
Can someone please do that.	Omuntu asobola nsaba okukola ekyo.
There was no way he was talking to anyone.	Tewali ngeri gye yali ayogera na muntu yenna.
Easily.	Kyangu.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
He said that	Yagambye nti .
But there is hope.	Naye waliwo essuubi.
Maybe he was.	Mpozzi nga yali.
And in that case, it was the same thing.	Era mu mbeera eyo, kyali kintu kye kimu.
Why exactly is it.	Lwaki ddala bwe kiri.
You have to do that.	Ekyo olina okukikola.
I don’t know how long.	Simanyi bbanga ki.
Or my job.	Oba omulimu gwange.
I think that's the point for us.	Ndowooza eyo y'ensonga eri ffe.
We can be better than that.	Tusobola okusinga ekyo.
I was afraid too.	Nange nnali ntya.
I know you’re there.	Nkimanyi nti oli awo.
And he was my father too.	Era naye yali taata wange.
However, it is not us.	Kyokka si ffe.
The thing he said was very difficult.	Ekintu kye yayogera kyali kizibu nnyo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
Where we are going.	Gye tugenda.
He could have been anyone.	Yali asobola okuba omuntu yenna.
My friend is here.	Mukwano gwange ali wano.
I couldn’t speak.	Nnali sisobola kwogera.
But we don’t have to.	Naye tetulina kukikola.
I know.	Mmanyi.
Now or nothing!.	Kati oba tewali!.
But then it will never be the same again.	Naye mu kiseera ekyo tekijja kuddamu kubeera nga bwe kyali.
And it will happen during the week.	Era kijja kubaawo mu wiiki.
A little bit of it.	Katono ddala.
I expect the same from you.	Nze nsuubira kye kimu okuva gy’oli.
It was really bad.	Ddala kyali kibi.
No one has it.	Tewali alina.
The same can happen here.	Ekintu kye kimu kiyinza okubaawo wano.
At the moment he can’t get something to eat here.	Mu kiseera kino tasobola kufuna kya kulya wano.
It looks really good.	Kirabika bulungi ddala.
Even.	Wadde.
Maybe, a little bit.	Mpozzi, katono.
Or he shouldn’t have.	Oba yali talina kuba na.
This is working with you.	Eno nkola naawe.
You have to talk to him.	Olina okwogera naye.
We should too.	Naffe tusaanidde.
Almost no one can.	Kumpi tewali asobola.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
Every thought .	Buli ndowooza .
But he knew he did.	Naye yali akimanyi nti yakikola.
He is just a human being.	Ye muntu yekka.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Saagala kulaba muntu yenna.
What a very happy man.	Nga musajja musanyufu nnyo.
He had been for a very long time.	Yali amaze ebbanga ddene nnyo.
But that’s not all.	Naye ekyo si kye kyokka.
I want to know what’s going on.	Njagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso.
He loved being with her.	Yali ayagala nnyo okubeera naye.
I would love to know why.	Njagala nnyo okumanya lwaki.
He will work again.	Ajja kuddamu okukola.
And it’s good for me.	Era kirungi gyendi.
He probably would have.	Oboolyawo yandibadde.
This is last week.	Eno wiiki ewedde.
You’ve been so good!	Obadde mulungi nnyo!
That’s what he would do.	Ekyo kye yandikoze.
Not in this case.	Si mu mbeera eno.
That’s all we can do.	Ekyo kyokka kye tusobola okukola.
But mostly it was good.	Naye okusinga kyali kirungi.
I didn’t know any of this at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nali simanyi kintu kyonna ku bino.
That was pretty easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo.
We have the time.	Tulina obudde.
You come right down.	Ojja ddala wansi.
Helping, it seems.	Okuyamba, kirabika nga.
I hope it happens soon.	Nsuubira nti kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono.
In a way, it was a good idea.	Mu ngeri emu, kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
He could do no wrong.	Yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna kibi.
I want you .	Njagala ggwe .
I was very happy about that.	Ekyo nnali musanyufu nnyo.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
Not to us, anyway.	Si gye tuli, mu ngeri yonna.
He knew how to do it.	Yali amanyi okukikola.
And nothing is going to work.	Era tewali kigenda kukola.
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kintu kirungi.
Not you either.	Si ggwe naawe.
I know it’s not me.	Nkimanyi nti si nze.
He knew someone was in the room.	Yali amanyi nti waliwo mu kisenge.
He did what he did.	Yakola ekyo kye yakola.
There is no such opportunity.	Tewali mukisa nga guno.
Not immediately.	Si mangu ddala.
And mostly you.	Era okusinga ggwe.
He loved everyone.	Yali ayagala nnyo buli muntu.
I don’t like it.	Sikyagala.
Although he was unhappy, he agreed.	Wadde yali si musanyufu, yakkiriza.
He is obviously not a man.	Kya lwatu nti si musajja.
He works hard every day.	Akola nnyo buli lunaku.
It was dangerous for them.	Kyali kya bulabe gye bali.
Money is not talking.	Ssente si kwogera.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Nnali simanyi nti waliwo ekintu ng’ekyo.
He did, of course.	Yakikola, ddala.
I love this product.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino.
I’ve been able to.	Nze mbadde nfunye.
Like in the movie.	Nga mu firimu.
He could have done a lot of things today.	Yandibadde akola ebintu bingi leero.
What place is this?	Kino kifo ki?
That’s what they are.	Ekyo kye bali.
He certainly knew that wasn't true.	Mazima ddala yali akimanyi nti ekyo si kituufu.
Maybe he'll come back with her now.	Mpozzi ajja kudda naye kati.
Not doing anything.	Obutakola kintu kyonna.
Like someone no one wants.	Nga omuntu tewali ayagala.
How are you going to do the same?.	Ggwe ogenda kukola otya ekintu kye kimu?.
That's why he's doing this.	Y'ensonga lwaki akola kino.
He didn't seem to want to talk.	Yalabika nga tayagala kwogera.
However, I couldn’t do it.	Kyokka nnali sisobola kukikola.
You can do this.	Kino osobola okukola.
You don’t have to do everything alone.	Tolina kukola buli kimu wekka.
I have no idea what’s going on.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
I’m sure he’ll be here very soon.	Nkakasa nti ajja kubeera wano mu bbanga ttono ddala.
I can see why you might come to that conclusion.	Nsobola okulaba lwaki oyinza okutuuka ku nsonga eyo.
I fear that this is it.	Ntya nti kino kye kiri.
It’s not easy at all.	Si kyangu n’akatono.
But here, there isn’t.	Naye wano, tewali.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
He doesn't want to talk.	Tayagala kwogera.
He needed money.	Yali yeetaaga ssente.
He should have taken a picture.	Yandibadde akuba ekifaananyi.
And we need whatever we can get.	Era twetaaga kyonna kye tusobola okufuna.
No, it wasn’t.	Nedda, si bwe yali.
What are you going to do?	Ogenda kukola ki?
I feel how I feel for me.	Mpulira engeri gye mpulira gyendi.
He has only me.	Alina nze nzekka.
It’s going to be difficult.	Kigenda kuba kizibu.
There is no hard work.	Tewali kukola nnyo.
She was a wonderful woman.	Yali mukyala mulungi nnyo.
And it is very powerful.	Era kya maanyi nnyo.
For me it was a problem.	Nze kyali kizibu.
He was doing very well.	Yali akola bulungi nnyo.
You can’t talk to him.	Tosobola kwogera naye.
He came to me.	Yajja gye ndi.
That’s what we need.	Ekyo kye twetaaga.
Maybe he's the one who can do anything too.	Mpozzi naye ye muntu asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
Quickly, and a lot.	Mu bwangu, era bingi.
He started driving the car.	Yatandika okuvuga mmotoka.
There are so many things here.	Wano waliwo ebintu bingi nnyo.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
It’s probably good for me in a way.	Oboolyawo kirungi gyendi mu ngeri emu.
And he says that.	Era agamba nti.
I had no idea how to do it today.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri gye nnyinza kukikola leero.
Now he was much better than that.	Kati yali asinga nnyo ekyo.
Of course, he would.	Kya lwatu nti yandikoze.
I don’t want to do it here.	Saagala kukikola wano.
It worked well for everyone.	Yakola bulungi eri buli muntu.
He is a very good player.	Muzannyi mulungi nnyo.
Can we do this?.	Kino tusobola okukikola?.
He must be with her.	Ateekwa okuba naye.
He couldn’t believe it was happening.	Yali tayinza kukkiriza nti kyali kigenda mu maaso.
What would you like to do?	Kiki kye wandyagadde okukola?
And in a way, it actually is.	Era mu ngeri emu, mu butuufu bwe kiri.
That’s not a bad thing for us.	Ekyo si kibi gye tuli.
He was my best friend.	Yali mukwano gwange nnyo.
We needed to get back to work.	Twali twetaaga okuddamu okukola.
In a relationship.	Mu mukwano.
I was happy.	Nnali musanyufu.
I’m glad you’re good.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli mulungi.
I just know he’s coming here.	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti ajja wano.
No one is in the car.	Tewali muntu yenna ali mu mmotoka.
He couldn’t go down there.	Yali tayinza kugenda wansi awo.
I won’t do that.	Ekyo sijja kukikola.
It was what he expected.	Kyali kye yali asuubira.
I could read that.	Ekyo nnali nsobola okusoma.
Not much, he thought.	Si bingi, bwe yalowooza.
We go to school every day.	Ffe tugenda ku ssomero buli lunaku.
Perhaps he had been.	Oboolyawo yali abadde.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
But now he couldn't say that.	Naye kati yali tasobola kwogera ekyo.
What do you think about this?.	Olowooza ki ku nsonga eno?.
It’s the same as you.	Kye kimu nga ggwe.
I had nothing and nothing.	Nnali sirina kintu kyonna era nga sirina kye nnali sirina.
But mostly he was a good kid.	Naye okusinga yali mwana mulungi.
I will stay here with him.	Nja kusigala wano naye.
He was in the room.	Yali mu kisenge.
I'll just go home.	Nja kumala kudda waka.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kintu kimu.
Nobody says anything.	Tewali ayogera kintu kyonna.
This is very important for you.	Kino kikulu nnyo gy’oli.
That is my problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyange.
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
We have to move forward.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso.
My son.	Mwana wange.
And he knew it too.	Era naye yali akimanyi.
But not like anyone else.	Naye si nga omuntu omulala yenna.
Not like here.	Si nga wano.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
I would love to help.	Njagala nnyo okuyamba.
As someone said, it’s not.	Nga omuntu bwe yagamba, si bwe kiri.
But to the point.	Naye eri ensonga.
I want to be me.	Njagala kubeera nze.
I hear you! 	Mpulira!
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
Right now is not the time.	Mu kiseera kino si kye kiseera.
A stranger appeared.	Omuntu gwe yali tamanyi yalabika.
That’s what we need to know.	Ekyo kye twetaaga okumanya.
I'm going there.	Nze ngenda eyo.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
Like there’s something here.	Nga waliwo ekintu wano.
We are a man and a woman.	Ffe tuli musajja na mukyala.
He is a very good player.	Muzannyi mulungi nnyo.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
This is on him.	Kino kiri ku ye.
Why not now?.	Lwaki nedda kati?.
These are not the same thing.	Bino si kintu kye kimu.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
He had to know what was going on.	Yalina okumanya ekigenda mu maaso.
I don’t know how to proceed.	Simanyi ngeri gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso.
Nothing good, maybe.	Tewali kirungi, mpozzi.
I don’t know where it is.	Simanyi gye kiri.
He said he would love that.	Yagamba nti ekyo yandiyagadde nnyo.
I needed to read this today.	Kino nali nneetaaga okusoma leero.
He can’t even speak properly.	Tasobola na kwogera bulungi.
I'm not well.	Siri bulungi.
You’re the problem here.	Ggwe ekizibu wano.
He was a very popular child.	Yali mwana muganzi nnyo.
But there was only me.	Naye nga waliwo nze nzekka.
But it is very important.	Naye kikulu nnyo.
There is no problem there.	Eyo tewali buzibu bwonna.
Everyone seems to have a personality.	Buli muntu alabika alina omuntu.
I need to do this.	Kino nneetaaga okukikola.
The dog is not a pet.	Embwa si ya mu nnyumba.
I don’t really have any feelings about it.	Mu butuufu sirina mpulira yonna ku nsonga eyo.
He was telling the truth.	Yali ayogera mazima.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ye mukyala mulungi.
You can see why.	Osobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
Knowing that you are here.	Okumanya nti oli wano.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
He knew what he wanted.	Yali amanyi kye yali ayagala.
He was very good that way.	Yali mulungi nnyo mu ngeri eyo.
That’s what I wanted.	Ekyo nnali njagala.
Maybe it’s time to move on.	Mpozzi kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
But he couldn’t.	Naye yali tasobola.
How much.	Mmeka.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
It's there.	Kiri eyo.
We’re going home now.	Tugenda waka kati.
I want to know.	Njagala kumanya.
I am now at home.	Nze kati ndi waka.
That’s a lot of it.	Ebyo bingi nnyo.
This is what is going to happen.	Kino kye kigenda okubaawo.
But not really.	Naye si ddala.
But he knew he wouldn't.	Naye yali akimanyi nti tajja kukikola.
It was quick and easy to do.	Kyali kyangu era nga kyangu okukola.
But it would have been anyway.	Naye kyandibadde mu ngeri yonna.
That's the opinion.	Eyo ndowooza.
Apparently it isn’t.	Kirabika si bwe kiri.
It doesn’t matter who.	Si kikulu ani.
He loved going to the movies.	Yali ayagala nnyo okugenda mu firimu.
I can never come home to you again.	Siyinza kuddamu kudda waka gy’oli.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
It would be for doing the right thing.	Kyandibadde lwa kukola kituufu.
Or that there isn’t.	Oba nti tewali.
I said no, I didn't.	Nagamba nti nedda.
You won’t do this alone.	Kino tojja kukikola wekka.
He often works long hours in the office.	Atera okukola essaawa nnyingi mu ofiisi.
This was very easy.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo.
He says he does it.	Agamba nti akikola.
Loves, loves, loves.	Ayagala, ayagala, ayagala.
But it will happen.	Naye kijja kubaawo.
He should have known better.	Yandibadde amanyi bulungi.
It was home.	Yali waka.
I'm going to have to go with him.	Ngenda kuba nnina okugenda ne ye.
It seems like something is wrong.	Kirabika nga waliwo ekintu ekizibu.
I was so close!	Nnali kumpi nnyo!
I'm going to the city.	Ngenda mu kibuga.
Everyone has to eat.	Buli muntu alina okulya.
He is still a man.	Akyali musajja.
He is a doctor, a good one.	Ye musawo, omulungi.
One can move on.	Omuntu asobola okugenda mu maaso.
This is the core of my problem.	Kino kye kikulu ekizibu kyange.
Back to you.	Okudda gy’oli.
He was a very loving man.	Yali musajja ayagala nnyo.
It’s a good movie.	Firimu nnungi.
It won’t be me.	Sijja kuba nze.
I am busy as usual.	Ndi bbize nga bulijjo.
But not at work.	Naye si bwe yali ku mulimu.
He is obviously a bit ahead at this point.	Kya lwatu nti ali mu maaso katono mu kiseera kino.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
In that car.	Mu mmotoka eyo.
He told me he was going home.	Yang’amba nti agenda waka.
He was very lonely.	Yali yekka nnyo.
He doesn’t know what he wants to do.	Tamanyi ky’ayagala kukola.
We can help deliver that.	Tusobola okuyamba okutuusa ekyo.
He saw.	Yalaba.
Now that’s how it was.	Kati bwe kyali.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
I want.	Njagala.
You are so strong, you are stronger than any of us.	Oli wa maanyi nnyo, oli wa maanyi okusinga omuntu yenna ku ffe.
Probably more than anyone else.	Oboolyawo okusinga omuntu omulala yenna.
That, of course, is critical.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kikulu nnyo.
It might, a little bit.	Kiyinza, katono.
He saw it happening.	Yalaba nga kigenda mu maaso.
You are not one of us.	Ggwe toli omu ku ffe.
He wanted to try again.	Yali ayagala kuddamu kugezaako.
He did it.	Yakikola.
He hoped it wasn’t him.	Yalina essuubi nti si ye.
Not at the moment.	Si mu kiseera kino.
He comes to school on the bus every day.	Ajja ku ssomero mu bbaasi buli lunaku.
My father was a good man.	Taata yali musajja mulungi.
Now he can do what he wants.	Kati asobola okukola ky’ayagala.
But it’s coming.	Naye kijja.
We are in the right.	Tuli mu kituufu.
I feel very happy here.	Mpulira nga ndi musanyufu nnyo wano.
I’m working here.	Nze nkola wano.
It goes quickly.	Kigenda mangu.
And there it is.	Era awo we kiri.
I have it now, too.	Nange kati nnina.
Everything looks good.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi.
As they are.	Nga bwe bali.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
It was very powerful.	Yali ya maanyi nnyo.
Really, really well.	Ddala, ddala bulungi.
But one has to move on.	Naye omuntu alina okugenda mu maaso.
He told me not to do anything.	Yang’amba obutakola kintu kyonna.
What kind of food, how much food.	Emmere ya ngeri ki, emmere mmeka.
But not much.	Naye si nnyo.
I don’t know how that can happen.	Ekyo simanyi ngeri ki gye kiyinza okubaawo.
What? 	Kiki?
I hope you will too.	Nsuubira naawe ojja kukikola.
He couldn’t even speak.	Yali tasobola na kwogera.
He didn't really know how long.	Mu butuufu yali tamanyi bbanga ki.
This is very important to me.	Kino kikulu nnyo gyendi.
I don’t want to do these things.	Ebintu bino saagala kukola.
That’s true, as far as it goes.	Ekyo kituufu, okutuuka we kigenda.
This can be anything you want.	Kino kiyinza okuba kyonna ky’oyagala.
I love movies.	Njagala nnyo firimu.
And he had to leave this house.	Era yalina okuva mu nnyumba eno.
Not much, really.	Si bingi, ddala.
He's been here a lot.	Abadde wano nnyo.
He loves my brother.	Ayagala nnyo muganda wange.
You are so beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo.
My brother is perfectly fine.	Muganda wange ali bulungi ddala.
But he must be alone.	Naye alina okuba nga yekka.
I have a lot of these.	Nnina bingi ku bino.
Maybe he expected too much of her.	Mpozzi yali asuubira bingi nnyo ku ye.
Who is.	Ani ali.
You always have and you always will.	Bulijjo olina era bulijjo ojja kuba.
His wife knew very well.	Mukyala we yali amanyi bulungi nnyo.
You know, when he is.	Omanyi, bwe ye.
What were you doing?	Ggwe wali okola ki?
We have to get out of this.	Tulina okuva mu kino.
You have your own agenda.	Olina agenda yo.
Nothing there, either.	Tewali kintu kyonna awo, era.
Why did he do it.	Lwaki yakikola.
He would have to think faster.	Yandibadde alina okulowooza amangu.
Everyone said he was.	Buli omu yagamba nti yali.
I couldn’t eat anything.	Nnali sisobola kulya kintu kyonna.
You could do something like this.	Oyinza okukola ekintu nga kino.
I’m not the only one who knows about this place.	Si nze nzekka amanyi ku kifo kino.
Of course, this is easier said than done.	Kya lwatu nti kino kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
He was completely ordinary.	Yali wa bulijjo ddala.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
He couldn’t stay on point.	Yali tasobola kusigala ku nsonga.
In many ways.	Mu ngeri nnyingi.
Of course that’s not entirely true.	Kya lwatu ekyo si kituufu ddala.
However, this is not the case here.	Kyokka, wano si bwe kiri.
However, we shall see.	Kyokka tujja kulaba.
No one knows what you want but you.	Tewali amanyi kyoyagala okuggyako ggwe.
I knew it was going to be bad.	Namanya nti kigenda kuba kibi.
Not all of us.	Si ffenna.
I have to go.	Nnina okugenda.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
I like my opinion.	Njagala nnyo endowooza yange.
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
That was certainly true of me.	Mazima ddala ekyo kyali kituufu ku nze.
The other was a man.	Omulala yali musajja.
One for each other.	Omu ku buli omu.
He's actually really good.	Mu butuufu ddala mulungi.
He will never talk to me again.	Tajja kuddamu kwogera nange.
It is not the case here.	Si bwe kiri wano.
Instead of this.	Mu kifo kya kino.
But not for the car.	Naye si lwa mmotoka.
I was young myself at the time.	Nze kennyini nnali muto mu kiseera ekyo.
This was an opportune moment.	Kino kyali kiseera kya mukisa.
But it wasn’t him.	Naye si ye yali.
I don’t have anything to do.	Sirina kye nkola.
That's how he was down.	Bwatyo bwe yali wansi.
He loves it so much.	Ayagala nnyo nnyo.
I want to be the best.	Njagala kubeera asinga.
Talking to you.	Okwogera naawe.
And completely harmless.	Era nga tewali bulabe ddala.
I know you can do it.	Nkimanyi nti osobola okukikola.
You don’t know what love is.	Tomanyi mukwano kye ki.
I didn’t know what was going to happen.	Nnali simanyi kigenda kubaawo.
And they were.	Era baali.
I don’t want that to happen again.	Ekyo saagala kuddamu kubaawo.
And not at all.	Era si ku katono.
That was coming, he knew.	Ekyo kyali kijja, yali akimanyi.
I needed to know, to see.	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya, okulaba.
I am not even that.	Nze siri wadde ekyo.
We can know many things.	Tusobola okumanya ebintu bingi.
I want to know why.	Njagala okumanya lwaki.
It is a very serious issue.	Ensonga ya maanyi nnyo.
I'll have to come back to this one.	Nja kuba nnina okudda ku eno.
It was.	Yali.
This food is.	Emmere eno eri...
We needed someone like him there.	Twali twetaaga omuntu nga ye eyo.
He has been.	Abadde...
It would be nice.	Kyandibadde kirungi.
I’m afraid that’s all we have.	Ntya nti ekyo kyokka kye tulina.
We can’t wait any longer.	Tetusobola kuddamu kulinda.
Is everything okay?	Buli kimu kirungi?
It’s not very good.	Si nnungi nnyo.
There is a place.	Waliwo we.
This much he did too.	Kino nnyo naye yakikola.
I’m working tomorrow.	Nkola enkya.
No one knows why.	Tewali amanyi lwaki.
It can do something like that.	Kiyinza okukola ekintu ng’ekyo.
But what about you? 	Naye otya?
He was here, he knew it now.	Yali wano, yali akimanyi kati.
We have to see.	Tulina okulaba.
Here is where that is.	Wano we wali ekyo.
He was doing a good job.	Yali akola omulimu mulungi.
I hope he doesn’t go.	Nsuubira nti tagenda.
But he does do so.	Naye akola bw’atyo.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
He certainly didn’t know.	Mazima ddala yali tamanyi.
I don’t want to eat anything right now.	Saagala kulya kintu kyonna mu kiseera kino.
We will definitely be back though.	Mazima ddala tujja kudda wadde.
And frankly, it’s not good.	Era mu butuufu, si kirungi.
Everyone knows that much.	Buli omu amanyi bingi ebyo.
And he wanted to.	Era yali ayagala.
But it won’t do it.	Naye tekijja kukikola.
It was just normal.	Kyali kya bulijjo kyokka.
He said that.	Yagambye nti.
I don’t know how bad it is.	Simanyi ngeri kibi gye kiri.
Not everyone in town is sick.	Si buli muntu mu kibuga nti mulwadde.
I am absolutely sure about that.	Nkakasa ddala ku nsonga eyo.
You know best.	Ggwe asinga okumanya.
It was my turn.	Yali kiseera kyange.
In reality this is not the case.	Mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
This is a class organization.	Kino kibiina kya kibiina.
But I wasn’t sure.	Naye nga sikakasa.
Not even the dog.	Si wadde embwa.
He is there right now.	Ali awo mu kiseera kino.
He was the only guy.	Ye yali ggaayi yekka.
It’s really nothing.	Ddala si kintu.
What was he doing.	Kiki kye yali akola.
We need to drive.	Twetaaga okuvuga.
We have food.	Tulina emmere.
And it was too early.	Era nga bukyali nnyo.
And he knew it too.	Era naye yali akimanyi.
It’s really nice.	Ddala kirungi.
The food is really good.	Emmere nnungi ddala.
I want to help, he said.	Njagala kuyamba, bwe yagambye.
I'll come here tomorrow.	Nja kujja wano enkya.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
He was sick.	Yali mulwadde.
He had no interest in the child.	Yali talina ky’ayagala ku mwana oyo.
It can be very difficult.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
He came here for a party.	Yajja wano ku kabaga.
It was difficult at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo kyali kizibu.
It was a friendly one.	Kyali kya mukwano.
He is not at home.	Tali waka.
We don’t have to wait.	Tetulina kulinda.
No one is stronger than he is.	Tewali asinga ye wa maanyi.
At that point, it would.	Mu kiseera ekyo, kyandibadde.
Now he was more curious.	Kati yali asinga kwagala kumanya.
I am a doctor.	Nze ndi musawo.
And now, he loves it.	Era kati, ayagala nnyo.
There is only one.	Waliwo omu yekka.
And that’s fine, actually.	Era ekyo kirungi, mu butuufu.
I might be able to help.	Nnyinza okuyamba.
He is a morning person.	Ye muntu wa makya.
He can’t go on.	Tasobola kugenda mu maaso.
I don’t know exactly where it is, he said.	Simanyi bulungi gye kiri, bwe yagambye.
That’s a good point.	Eyo nsonga nnungi.
I need help like no.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi nga nedda.
Everyone is lucky.	Buli muntu alina omukisa.
It won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo.
No problem finding a place.	Tewali buzibu kufuna kifo.
Call anytime brother.	Kuba essaawa yonna muganda wange.
I'm the one.	Nze oyo.
I just want to be.	Nze njagala nnyo okubeera.
I know nothing about it.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
He was really a good man.	Ddala yali musajja mulungi.
He is the best.	Ye asinga obulungi.
We should all do better.	Ffenna tusaanidde okukola obulungi.
Down in one.	Wansi mu kimu.
Now this is the problem.	Kati kino kye kizibu.
That seems normal.	Ekyo kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
I am not ready for this.	Kino siri mwetegefu.
All right, that's what it is.	Kirungi, ekyo kye kiri.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
Really.	Kituufu.
And now you want to go home.	Era kati oyagala kudda waka.
I wanted to get back to town as soon as possible.	Nnali njagala kudda mu kibuga mu bwangu.
I don’t think this is true.	Kino sirowooza nti kituufu.
It’s not like that though.	Si bwe kiri wadde.
He could watch the movie if he wanted to.	Yali asobola okulaba firimu eyo singa yali ayagala.
No, it’s not there.	Nedda, si awo.
The dog is asleep.	Embwa yeebase.
It’s up to you what you want.	Kiri gy’oli ky’oyagala.
I didn’t know what to say.	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera.
I’m in danger.	Nze ndi mu bulabe.
And now is the time.	Era kati kye kiseera.
I think that's him.	Ndowooza oyo ye ye.
My attitude was very positive.	Endowooza yange yali nnungi nnyo.
No, no problem here.	Nedda, tewali buzibu wano.
He knew it would happen.	Yali akimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
The concept is here.	Endowooza eri wano.
He wasn’t going to play.	Yali tagenda kuzannya.
He just wasn’t going to do it.	Yali tagenda kukikola kyokka.
You can do whatever you want.	Osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
I love driving cars.	Njagala nnyo okuvuga mmotoka.
Happy to help.	Musanyufu okuyamba.
I will have to get these.	Bino nja kuba nnina okufuna.
I need to think.	Nze nneetaaga okulowooza.
I know it’s early but we have to go.	Nkimanyi nti bukyali naye tulina okugenda.
It’s not a man’s house.	Si nnyumba ya musajja.
And he could do it.	Era yali asobola okukikola.
I don’t have a relationship with him.	Sirina mukwano naye.
That’s what’s there.	Ekyo kye kiri awo.
I am happy now.	Ndi musanyufu kati.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
He loves to help.	Ayagala nnyo okuyamba.
He was a young child.	Yali mwana muto.
We’ll see what he has.	Tujja kulaba ky’alina.
No one spoke to him.	Tewali yayogera naye.
Not much back, even that.	Si nnyo emabega, wadde ekyo.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
To be here now.	Okubeera wano kati.
Everything is what it is, and it is everything.	Buli kimu kye kiri, era kye buli kimu.
However, it was good.	Kyokka, kyali kirungi.
He couldn’t tell.	Yali tasobola kumanya.
I certainly have those.	Mazima ddala ebyo nnina.
It seems to me like we have a problem.	Kirabika gyendi nga tulina ekizibu.
He must have.	Alina okuba nga alina.
I'm afraid he might be.	Ntya nti ayinza okuba nga.
I knew exactly what to expect.	Nnali mmanyi bulungi kye nnali nsuubira.
My wife is doing well.	Mukyala wange akola bulungi.
It’s important to know you’re not alone.	Kikulu okumanya nti toli wekka.
Now you have to eat.	Kati olina okulya.
It’s not a person.	Si muntu.
I love how it looks.	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kirabika.
Someone knows better.	Waliwo amanyi bulungi.
For an hour.	Okumala essaawa emu.
And it’s just so important.	Era kikulu nnyo kyokka.
In this regard.	Mu kino.
He came really close.	Yajja ddala kumpi.
Everyone wanted it that way.	Buli omu yali ayagala bw’atyo.
He is not a morning person.	Si muntu wa makya.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
But it’s not a job.	Naye si mulimu.
You have to be at home.	Olina okuba awaka.
It’s not just you and me.	Si nze naawe ffekka.
It was my turn.	Yali kiseera kyange.
You know better than that.	Ggwe omanyi okusinga ekyo.
There it is .	Eyo gye kiri .
You are my wife.	Ggwe mukyala wange.
But it was difficult.	Naye kyali kizibu.
And so he had it.	Era bw’atyo bwe yalina.
It’s time to get things done.	Kye kiseera okukola ebintu.
he’s the one who says.	y’agamba nti.
You know you are like my wife.	Omanyi oli nga mukyala wange.
Not true, by any means.	Si kituufu, mu ngeri yonna.
You are a young, beautiful woman.	Oli mukyala muto, mulungi.
It’s very good for me.	Kirungi nnyo gyendi.
Here is a picture of him.	Wano waliwo ekifaananyi kye.
The picture is below.	Ekifaananyi kiri wansi.
I guess it doesn’t matter.	Ntebereza nti si kikulu.
It’s not a way of anything.	Si ngeri ya kintu kyonna.
Or he will come back.	Oba ajja kudda.
Now he knew.	Kati yali amanyi.
All alone.	Byonna yekka.
There is nothing we can do.	Tewali kye tusobola kukola.
We are very lucky.	Tuli ba mukisa nnyo.
Until he is.	Okutuusa ye.
In any place.	Mu kifo kyonna.
You can’t live here without it.	Tosobola kubeera wano nga tolina.
Any trouble, that's it.	Obuzibu bwonna, ekyo kye kiri.
Are you afraid of dogs?	Otya embwa?
You will get the point.	Ojja kufuna ensonga.
But if he did .	Naye singa yakikola .
Will be back soon.	Ajja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
But he could tell.	Naye yali asobola okumanya.
I can talk to him really well now.	Nsobola okwogera naye ddala bulungi kati.
But he would work.	Naye yandikoze.
He wasn’t really thinking.	Yali talowooza ddala.
He does that now.	Akola bw’atyo kati.
I’m really fine.	Nze ddala ndi bulungi.
I have this feeling that he is happy.	Nnina endowooza eno nti musanyufu.
we can’t go.	tetusobola kugenda.
Maybe it will be enough.	Mpozzi kijja kumala.
It wasn’t his place.	Si kye kyali kifo kye.
This was an excellent answer.	Kino kyali kya kuddamu kirungi nnyo.
There could be many reasons for that.	Ekyo kiyinza okubaawo ensonga nnyingi.
And everyone else.	Era buli omu.
We are fine now.	Tuli bulungi kati.
Thinking hard.	Okulowooza ennyo.
I don’t know why not but it’s not.	Simanyi lwaki si bwe kiri naye si bwe kiri.
Who knows what.	Ani amanyi kiki.
That’s probably fine for now.	Ekyo osanga kirungi mu kiseera kino.
Are you with us?.	Oli naffe?.
He does the work in you.	Akola omulimu mu ggwe.
He doesn’t have to see us here.	Talina kulaba nga tuli wano.
I know what it is like.	Nze mmanyi bwe kiri.
It looks pretty much the same.	Kirabika bulungi nga kye kimu.
No problem.	Tewali buzibu.
This can do it.	Kino kiyinza okukikola.
I will never do it again.	Sijja kuddamu kukikola.
I don't want to.	Saagala.
Yeah, yeah.	Ye ye.
My father couldn’t believe it.	Taata yali tasobola kukkiriza.
He says he is happy.	Agamba nti musanyufu.
He couldn’t even speak.	Yali tasobola na kwogera.
He could hardly answer.	Yali tasobola bulungi kuddamu.
Do you think it’s important to recycle?.	Olowooza kikulu okuddamu okukola ebintu?.
But most of all he is my best friend.	Naye okusinga byonna ye mukwano gwange asinga.
He's just trying to be nice.	Agezaako kubeera mulungi yekka.
I thought he had.	Nalowooza nti yalina.
I need some help.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi.
I have no friends.	Nze tewali mikwano.
Not a little if.	Si katono singa.
He didn’t want to see anyone.	Yali tayagala kulaba muntu yenna.
She was a wonderful woman.	Yali mukyala mulungi nnyo.
But he didn’t want to.	Naye yali tayagala.
It was a beautiful place.	Kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
The police came anyway.	Poliisi yajja mu ngeri yonna.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
For all of them.	Ku byonna.
No way, no how.	Tewali ngeri, tewali ngeri ki.
I guess that’s a good thing.	Ntebereza nti ekyo kintu kirungi.
But he loves it there.	Naye ayagala nnyo eyo.
In this way.	Mu ngeri eno.
And that’s not a bad thing.	Era ekyo si kibi.
He is a really nice man.	Musajja mulungi ddala.
This problem seems very complicated.	Ekizibu kino kirabika nga kizibu nnyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I hope this is the case.	Nsuubira nti kino bwe kiri.
It’s still early.	Bukyali bukyali.
They are not.	Si bwe bali.
I feel really good.	Mpulira bulungi ddala.
He expected trouble.	Yali asuubira obuzibu.
It was a good time to think.	Kyali kiseera kirungi okulowooza.
That’s a common practice.	Eyo nkola ya bulijjo.
And he is here with us.	Era ali wano naffe.
He needs help immediately.	Yeetaaga obuyambi mu bwangu.
This is not my room.	Kino si kye kisenge kyange.
I love things.	Njagala nnyo ebintu.
I have been in that situation.	Mbadde mu mbeera eyo.
He loves it so much.	Ayagala nnyo.
I won’t even talk to you tomorrow.	Sijja na kwogera naawe enkya.
It’s not a matter of policy.	Si nsonga ya nkola.
But we have it.	Naye tulina.
Not now, not always, he said.	Si kati, si bulijjo, bwe yagambye.
I love the two of them together.	Njagala nnyo bombi nga bali wamu.
You have to study at home.	Olina okusoma awaka.
I will be there.	Nja kubeerawo.
Everyone.	Buli omu.
He can do no wrong.	Tasobola kukola kintu kyonna kibi.
I thought quickly.	Nalowooza mangu.
And he will go.	Era ajja kugenda.
I won’t be in the city.	Sijja kubeera mu kibuga.
I’m thinking about you too.	Nange ndowooza ku ggwe.
I am strong.	Ndi wa maanyi.
I could easily do it.	Nnali nsobola bulungi okukikola.
You just don’t know.	Ggwe kyokka tomanyi.
That’s how he got the money.	Bwatyo bwe yafuna ssente.
She looks and looks great.	Alabika era alabika bulungi nnyo.
And if my father had his way, he still wouldn’t work.	Era singa taata yalina engeri ye, n’okutuusa kati yali tagenda kukola.
He doesn’t like it very much.	Tayagala nnyo.
We are sick.	Tuli mulwadde.
He couldn’t see.	Yali tasobola kulaba.
I don’t know what could happen.	Simanyi kiyinza kubaawo.
He is a good friend of mine.	Ye mukwano gwange omulungi.
Although you would like to.	Wadde nga wandyagadde.
He is very strong.	Ali wa maanyi nnyo.
I have so much more.	Nnina bingi nnyo.
But now is not the time.	Naye kati si kye kiseera.
It was my everything.	Kyali buli kimu kyange.
It seems to be true.	Kirabika nga kituufu.
One of us will do it.	Omu ku ffe ajja kukikola.
We were going to do it.	Twali tugenda kukikola.
But that assumption is not in point.	Naye endowooza eyo si mu nsonga.
He talked to me for an hour.	Yayogera nange okumala essaawa emu.
You want to be human.	Oyagala kubeera muntu.
I know this for a reason.	Kino nkimanyi lwa nsonga.
That is certainly true.	Ekyo mazima ddala kituufu.
We can help!.	Tusobola okuyamba!.
You don’t know what it’s going to do.	Tomanyi kigenda kukola ki.
I’m a player.	Nze ndi muzannyi.
It just had to happen.	Kyalina okubaawo kyokka.
Nobody does that.	Ekyo tewali akikola.
That’s easy to see.	Ekyo kyangu okulaba.
I have been here a very long time.	Mbadde wano ebbanga ddene nnyo.
Here it was.	Wano we kyali.
But we can’t either.	Naye tetusobola era.
It really isn’t an issue.	Mazima ddala si nsonga.
But, it’s bad.	Naye, kibi.
He wanted to quit his job.	Yali ayagala okuva ku mulimu gwe.
Now it’s my turn to watch.	Kati kye kiseera kyange okulaba.
And it’s very important.	Era kikulu nnyo.
I would love to know what it is.	Njagala nnyo okumanya kye kiri.
That’s not my whole point.	Ekyo si nsonga yange yonna.
This will most likely happen.	Kino kye kijja okusinga okubaawo.
With luck, we’ll make it in time.	Nga tulina omukisa, tujja kukikola mu budde.
We were friends.	Twali ba mukwano.
In the room.	Mu kisenge.
Everything was fine.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi.
I hope it will happen.	Nsuubira nti kijja kubaawo.
Who knows.	Ani amanyi.
He wants to move on.	Ayagala kugenda mu maaso.
But they were there.	Naye baali awo.
I don’t want anything.	Nze sirina kye njagala.
Everyone knows that won’t happen.	Buli omu akimanyi nti ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
You have one brother.	Olina muganda omu.
And this is not a good thing.	Era kino si kintu kirungi.
I don’t even want to do it.	Saagala na kukikola.
She loved the home.	Yali ayagala nnyo awaka.
He didn’t know what to do to help.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola kuyamba.
Actually, no.	Mu butuufu nedda.
Maybe something really is going to happen tonight.	Mpozzi ddala waliwo ekigenda okubaawo ekiro kino.
I love how difficult it is.	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kizibu.
I can do nothing but watch.	Sirina kye nsobola kukola okuggyako okulaba.
It's all he would need.	Kye kyokka kye yandibadde yeetaaga.
However, I was lucky.	Kyokka nnali wa mukisa.
No one is working.	Tewali akola.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
I can get there.	Nsobola okutuuka.
Apparently you had no idea what he was doing there.	Kirabika wali tolina kirowoozo kyonna ku kye yali akola eyo.
It’s neither good nor bad.	Si kirungi wadde kibi.
No one came to the party.	Tewali muntu yenna yajja ku mbaga eno.
Not for anyone.	Si lwa muntu yenna.
I know that very well.	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi nnyo.
Together we can do it!.	Nga tuli wamu tusobola okukikola!.
And that one guy.	Ne ggaayi oyo omu.
But he would rather not.	Naye yandibadde asinga obutakola.
He didn’t know what he was doing.	Yali tamanyi kye yali akola.
I thought we could both go.	Nalowooza nti ffembi tusobola okugenda.
I’m just thinking about the baby.	Nze ndowooza ku mwana yekka.
I don’t want it here.	Saagala wano.
He is not a threat here.	Si ye wa bulabe wano.
I should be one.	Nze nsaanidde okuba omu.
I should do that too.	Ekyo nange nsaanidde okukikola.
But there was.	Naye nga waliwo.
I always am.	Nze bulijjo ndi.
But really no one knows.	Naye ddala tewali amanyi.
I don’t know what’s wrong with this.	Simanyi kizibu mu kino.
He prefers to take the bus.	Asinga kwagala kugenda mu bbaasi.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
Indeed, he thought he had to.	Mazima ddala, yalowooza nti yalina okukikola.
Must be willing to act quickly.	Alina okuba nga mwetegefu okukola mu bwangu.
I think he's here.	Ndowooza ali wano.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
In the evening, he began to see things.	Akawungeezi, yatandika okulaba ebintu.
And almost no one has a problem.	Era kumpi tewali muntu yenna alina buzibu.
He did it alone.	Yakikola yekka.
You don’t want any trouble.	Toyagala buzibu bwonna.
Her house was beautiful.	Ennyumba ye yali nnungi nnyo.
This is very easy to do.	Kino kyangu nnyo okukola.
This is a really nice place.	Kino kifo kirungi nnyo ddala.
I have to get out of here.	Nnina okuva wano.
He didn’t know what and he didn’t know why.	Yali tamanyi ki era nga tamanyi lwaki.
That’s what I expected.	Ekyo nnali nsuubira.
Can you think of anything?.	Osobola okulowooza ku kintu kyonna?.
I may have been there with him.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnali eyo naye.
Nobody knows how to do that.	Ekyo tewali amanyi kukikola.
In what direction exactly?	Mu ludda ki ddala?
No, there is no problem.	Nedda, tewali buzibu.
One thing at a time.	Ekintu kimu ku kimu.
You can’t tell what’s going to happen.	Tosobola kumanya kiki ekigenda okubaawo.
And this is very important.	Era kino kikulu nnyo.
It’s good and it’s good.	Kirungi era kirungi.
He was talking to himself, apparently.	Yali ayogera yekka, kirabika.
I wanted to make time.	Nnali njagala okufuna obudde.
I have a lot to do.	Nnina bingi bye nnina okukola.
It was actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyali kyangu nnyo.
He was helpless and hopeless.	Yali talina buyambi wadde essuubi.
I’ve been terrified.	Nze mbadde ntya nnyo.
I was very, very nervous.	Nali ntya nnyo nnyo.
This is bad and evil.	Kino kibi era kibi.
You’re going home.	Ggwe ogenda eka.
But it’s not true.	Naye si kituufu.
No one would do that.	Tewali yandikoze ekyo.
Good, he said.	Kirungi, bwe yagambye.
It was just him.	Yali ye yekka.
I am very well off.	Nze ndi bulungi nnyo.
I’m there now.	Nze ndi awo kati.
What a beautiful sight!	Nga kirungi nnyo!
But that was all.	Naye bwe kyali ekyo kyokka.
Where is that? 	Ekyo kiri ludda wa?
I thought he did.	Nnalowooza nti yakikola.
Or not really.	Oba si ddala.
But he is in trouble.	Naye ali mu buzibu.
Everyone has to do their job.	Buli muntu alina okukola omulimu gwe.
That one.	Oyo omu.
Good weather.	Obudde obulungi.
I’m ready to go now.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okugenda kati.
I thought it was great.	Nalowooza nti kirungi nnyo.
He was very good that way.	Yali mulungi nnyo mu ngeri eyo.
True or not.	Kituufu oba nedda.
He could have.	Yali asobola.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
This isn’t just an idea, this is reality.	Kino si kirowoozo kyokka, kino kya ddala.
It’s time to go.	Kye kiseera okugenda.
But it would be very dangerous.	Naye kyandibadde kya bulabe nnyo.
He didn’t think that was going to be a problem.	Yali talowooza nti ekyo kyali kigenda kuba kizibu.
Or maybe even.	Oba mpozzi ne...
Until that night.	Okutuusa ekiro ekyo.
I think that’s what it is.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kiri.
Apparently he has.	Kirabika alina...
It could have been anyone.	Kyandibadde omuntu yenna.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
No one was happy about this.	Kino tewali yali musanyufu.
He thought that was a good move.	Yalowooza nti eyo yali nkola nnungi.
I am actually a man.	Mu butuufu ndi musajja.
I hope that’s true.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kituufu.
He doesn’t know who.	Tamanyi ani.
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
Or is he?.	Oba ye?.
I won’t stay long.	Sijja kumala bbanga ddene.
She knew it and he knew she knew it.	Yali akimanyi era yali akimanyi nti akimanyi.
I'll stay here.	Nja kusigala wano.
He had to get out of here.	Yalina okuva wano.
It was very powerful.	Yali ya maanyi nnyo.
I’m just happy to be here.	Nze ndi musanyufu kyokka okubeera wano.
I was very busy.	Nnali bbize nnyo.
Surely, one could do such a thing.	Mazima ddala, omuntu yali asobola okukola ekintu ng’ekyo.
And they were very lucky.	Era baali ba mukisa nnyo.
That’s hard, but it’s good.	Ekyo kizibu naye kirungi.
In fact, he had been.	Mu butuufu, yali abadde.
That’s a good thing.	Ekyo kintu kirungi.
You are as childish as ever.	Oli mwana nnyo nga bwe wali.
You have it in you.	Ggwe olina mu ggwe.
He doesn’t think so.	Talowooza bw’atyo.
I don't know how to do it can you help.	Simanyi ngeri ya kukikola osobola okuyamba.
This is what will happen.	Kino kye kijja okubaawo.
Or tried to be.	Oba yagezaako okubeera.
But of course.	Naye ddala.
I don’t want to go back to that.	Saagala kudda ku ekyo.
We obviously have a job to do.	Kya lwatu tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
No one is coming.	Tewali ajja.
I love being here.	Njagala nnyo okubeera wano.
I think he talks to everyone.	Ndowooza ayogera ne buli muntu.
That won’t happen.	Ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
I’m sure they are.	Nkakasa nti bwe bali.
Only she knew he was real.	Ye yekka ye yali amanyi nti wa ddala.
Better.	Okusinga.
He was always a pleasure to watch.	Bulijjo yali musanyufu okulaba.
Not me, of course.	Si nze, ddala.
Now he was safe.	Kati yali talina bulabe.
Everyone wants it.	Buli omu ayagala.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
It looks good to me.	Kirabika bulungi gyendi.
Nothing really.	Tewali kintu kyonna mu butuufu.
Lower than low, actually.	Wansi okusinga wansi, mu butuufu.
He goes on and on.	Agenda mu maaso.
It is a very difficult place.	Kifo kizibu nnyo.
There is an issue in this place.	Waliwo ensonga mu kifo kino.
No man can.	Tewali musajja asobola.
I can’t do it with him.	Sisobola naye.
which.	nga.
He is real and yet human, as we all are.	Ye wa ddala era naye muntu, nga ffenna bwe tuli.
However,	Kyokka, .
I don’t know where it is.	Simanyi gye kiri.
Nothing was going better.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyali kigenda mu maaso bulungi okusinga ekyo.
I hope you know that.	Nsuubira ekyo okimanyi.
No one knows where you are.	Tewali amanyi gyoli.
I don’t know why but he is.	Simanyi lwaki naye ye bw’atyo.
What will happen, will happen.	Ekigenda okubaawo, kijja kubaawo.
I want to see an actress.	Njagala kulaba muzannyi wa firimu.
Today everyone does that.	Leero buli omu akola ekyo.
It certainly can work.	Mazima ddala kiyinza okukola.
Lots of things like that.	Ebintu bingi nga ebyo.
That’s not very much.	Ekyo si bingi nnyo.
It’s just good.	Kirungi kyokka.
He just knew he didn't want to be alone.	Yali akimanyi kyokka nti tayagala kubeera yekka.
It’s a friend.	Gwe mukwano.
This is not a good job.	Guno si mulimu mulungi.
But he wasn’t going to go.	Naye yali tagenda kugenda.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
He was a teacher.	Yali musomesa.
It was in the future.	Kyali mu maaso.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
But it’s complicated, very complicated.	Naye kizibu, kizibu nnyo.
I was really lucky.	Ddala nnali wa mukisa.
He would do anything.	Yandikoze ekintu kyonna.
But he was still good.	Naye yali akyali mulungi.
It’s really something.	Ddala kintu.
We can’t stay here.	Tetusobola kusigala wano.
The problem, that.	Ekizibu, ekyo.
He needed to be.	Yali yeetaaga okuba.
I can’t even be my friend.	Sisobola na kubeera mukwano gwange.
Reading is a job.	Okusoma mulimu.
It’s a common issue.	Ensonga ya bulijjo.
You can help too.	Naawe osobola okuyamba.
It’s going to happen soon.	Kigenda kubaawo mu bwangu.
We have so much time.	Tulina obudde bungi nnyo.
It is not an ideological view.	Si ndowooza ya ndowooza.
They are close.	Bali kumpi.
But the police did.	Naye poliisi yakikola.
He had something.	Yalina ekintu kye yalina.
He had a phone.	Yalina essimu.
You won’t let it happen.	Tojja kukkiriza kubaawo.
Maybe there are too many reasons.	Mpozzi waliwo ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
Or something had.	Oba ekintu kyalina.
You’re not at work.	Toli ku mulimu.
Are you all right?' 	Oli bulungi?’.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
I do the same thing.	Nange nkola kye kimu.
No, that’s a thing.	Nedda, ekyo kintu.
You have to make a phone call.	Olina okukuba essimu.
But you can’t.	Naye tosobola.
However, you will be fine.	Kyokka ojja kuba bulungi.
I needed to go.	Nnali nneetaaga okugenda.
And that’s what we were there for.	Era ekyo kye twali eyo.
He saw what it was.	Yalaba kye kyali.
I would love to talk to you.	Njagala nnyo okwogera naawe.
But this was terrible.	Naye kino kyali kibi nnyo.
This is my job.	Guno gwe mulimu gwange.
We cannot know what will happen.	Tetusobola kumanya kijja kubaawo.
They were his friends.	Baali mikwano gye.
You know this to be true.	Kino okimanyi nti kituufu.
But he had no money.	Naye yali talina ssente.
But we	Naye ffe .
I wanted to see the whole thing.	Nnali njagala okulaba ekintu kyonna.
You are not my child.	Ggwe toli mwana wange.
Maybe it’s as simple as that.	Mpozzi nga kyangu nga ekyo.
He thought and he thought.	Yalowooza era n’alowooza.
It’s easy to do.	Kyangu okukola.
They were almost there.	Baali kumpi awo.
And soon enough.	Era mu bbanga ttono.
To me it was.	Eri nze bwe kyali.
I want to be something.	Njagala kubeera kintu.
Now nothing was as it should be.	Kati tewali kyali nga bwe kyalina okuba.
I'll just go home.	Nja kumala kudda waka.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
We can do this together.	Kino tusobola okukikola nga tuli wamu.
He was everywhere.	Yali wa buli wamu.
This, not so much.	Kino, si nnyo.
Or that’s what it seemed.	Oba ekyo kye kyali kirabika.
What are you doing?	Okola ki?
From the front.	Okuva mu maaso.
So far he's doing really well.	N'okutuusa kati akola bulungi ddala.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
And he was well aware of that.	Era ekyo yali akimanyi bulungi.
It was for him now.	Kyali eri ye kati.
But it’s not good.	Naye si kirungi.
He'll come here.	Ajja kujja wano.
You've been.	Obadde.
Do you know where this was?	Omanyi kino gye kyali?
We all have one.	Ffenna tulina emu.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
I don’t care and neither do you.	Nze sirina kye nkola era naawe tolina kye nkola.
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
It was really beautiful.	Ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
To me he was very good.	Eri nze yali mulungi nnyo.
And a friend to everyone.	Era mukwano gwa buli muntu.
It goes with everything.	Kigenda ne buli kimu.
No, that is not the case.	Nedda, ekyo si bwe kiri.
When he left.	Bwe yagenda.
Maybe that’s what he would do.	Mpozzi ekyo kye yandikoze.
This was very powerful.	Kino kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
The food is very good here.	Emmere nnungi nnyo wano.
It’s really bad now.	Kibi ddala kati.
Everyone was friendly.	Buli omu yali wa mukwano.
And he knows everything.	Era amanyi buli kimu.
I just have to be nice.	Nnina okubeera omulungi kyokka.
I know he was.	Nkimanyi nti yali.
This is true in so many ways.	Kino kituufu mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo.
It won’t be good.	Tekijja kuba kirungi.
No one tried.	Tewali yagezaako.
You don’t, you don’t have time.	Ggwe tolina, tolina budde.
I’m not like you.	Nze siri nga ggwe.
He couldn’t tell where.	Yali tasobola kumanya wa.
In this case.	Mu mbeera eno.
Not nearly enough.	Si kumpi kumala.
But.	Naye.
He had no money on him.	Yali talina ssente yonna ku ye.
Not even to himself.	Si wadde eri ye kennyini.
I must be going, you said.	Nnina okuba nga ngenda, bwe wagamba.
He will see that.	Ajja kulaba ekyo.
He thought he was asleep.	Yalowooza nti yeebase.
Now it’s much easier.	Kati kyangu nnyo.
I needed another one.	Omulala nnali nneetaaga.
But he acknowledged the point.	Naye yakkiriza ensonga eyo.
I thought about the house.	Nalowooza ku nnyumba.
Did you know there was.	Obadde okimanyi nti waliwo.
If anyone can help, that would be great.	Singa waliwo asobola okuyamba, kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
There is no answer to that.	Tewali kuddamu ku ekyo.
However, it is difficult to do many things well.	Kyokka, kizibu okukola obulungi ebintu bingi.
Always on time, very friendly.	Bulijjo mu budde, wa mukwano nnyo.
Now it’s up to you.	Kati kiri gyoli.
You don’t know what’s going on down there.	Tomanyi kigenda mu maaso wansi awo.
From home.	Okuva awaka.
Back to me.	Okudda ku nze.
It was a momentous occasion.	Kyali kiseera kikulu nnyo.
I have to know.	Nnina okumanya.
He thought like us.	Yali alowooza nga ffe.
These include .	Mu bino mulimu .
The same is true of us.	Kye kimu ne ffe.
Now he is here.	Kati ali wano.
He doesn't want to talk.	Tayagala kwogera.
We’ll just finish here.	Tujja kumala wano.
As you were.	Nga bwe wali.
I didn’t want to see.	Nnali saagala kulaba.
He would have loved to be here today.	Yandibadde ayagala nnyo okubeera wano leero.
You won’t do that.	Ekyo tojja kukikola.
I just can’t.	Nze sisobola kyokka.
As bad as everything.	Nga kibi nga buli kimu.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
This will be very difficult.	Kino kijja kuba kizibu nnyo.
But really, it could be anything.	Naye ddala, kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
That will certainly help.	Mazima ddala ekyo kijja kuyamba.
But it will be here soon.	Naye kijja kuba wano mu bbanga ttono.
No one knows why or how.	Tewali amanyi lwaki oba ngeri ki.
But it’s there.	Naye kiri awo.
It’s not a normal situation.	Si mbeera ya bulijjo.
And there is a problem.	Era waliwo ekizibu.
He went away.	Yagenda.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
I love to talk.	Njagala nnyo okwogera.
That’s a terrible thing.	Ekyo kibi nnyo.
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
The only thing.	Ekintu kyokka.
He just thought he had.	Yalowooza kyokka nti alina.
And everywhere.	Era buli wamu.
He will be able to help.	Ajja kusobola okuyamba.
Is everything okay? 	Buli kimu kirungi?
We have a lot to do in the morning.	Tulina bingi bye tulina okukola ku makya.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
They were here.	Baali wano.
You certainly have that point.	Mazima ddala olina ensonga eyo.
Why, he didn't know.	Lwaki, yali tamanyi.
What! 	Kiki!
He was really a good thing for me.	Ddala yali kintu kirungi gyendi.
He was ready.	Yali mwetegefu.
I knew that wouldn’t be enough.	Namanya nti ekyo tekijja kumala.
He often reads in the morning.	Atera okusoma ku makya.
I knew what it would be.	Nali mmanyi kye kyandibadde.
It is very simple on why.	Kyangu nnyo ku nsonga lwaki.
I love my dog.	Njagala nnyo embwa yange.
I love it so much!.	Njagala nnyo!.
As he had.	Nga bwe yalina.
Everyone was in danger.	Buli omu yali mu bulabe.
But this looks good actually.	Naye kino kirabika bulungi mu butuufu.
He loves being with her.	Ayagala nnyo okubeera naye.
She is young and beautiful.	Muto era mulungi nnyo.
I want to achieve exactly the same when there.	Njagala okutuuka ku kye kimu ddala nga waliwo.
That's what it is.	Ekyo kye ki.
I do better every day though.	Nze nkola bulungi buli lunaku wadde.
Or would he like to work.	Oba yandiyagadde okukola.
Or someone else.	Oba omuntu omulala.
There are	Mulimu .
That's the point.	Eyo y'ensonga.
I wanted money.	Nnali njagala ssente.
We need each other.	Twetaaga buli omu.
I am the lucky one.	Nze ndi wa mukisa.
We can win.	Tusobola okuwangula.
He couldn’t even speak.	Yali tasobola na kwogera.
I’m not going to talk to you about it.	Sigenda kwogera naawe ku nsonga eyo.
You are in a very dangerous situation for yourself.	Oli mu mbeera ya bulabe nnyo gyoli.
Are you ready?.	Oli mwetegefu?.
No answer, really.	Tewali kuddamu, ddala.
Or anyone else.	Oba omuntu yenna.
We will deal with each other in turn.	Tujja kukola ku buli omu mu kuddamu.
In the morning, you said.	Ku makya, bwe wagamba.
You are not even human in truth.	Toli wadde omuntu mu mazima.
And for a while, he had.	Era okumala akaseera, yalina.
And this is very important.	Era kino kikulu nnyo.
I have no idea how.	Sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri ki.
I thought it was my turn.	Nalowooza nti kye kiseera kyange.
We’ll be there.	Tujja kuba awo.
I guess we’ll see.	Ntebereza nti tujja kulaba.
I think it’s a good thing.	Ndowooza nti kintu kirungi.
However, I want to say one thing.	Kyokka, njagala okwogera ekintu kimu.
What he just said is not true.	Kye yayogera kyokka si kituufu.
That would be the highlight of his career.	Ekyo kyandibadde kikulu nnyo mu mulimu gwe.
He was fun to talk to.	Yali musanyufu okwogera naye.
Maybe it’s the same thing.	Mpozzi nga kye kimu.
Someone did this.	Kino omuntu yakikola.
But not to get anything.	Naye si kufuna kintu kyonna.
Whether anyone does it that way is not the point.	Oba waliwo akikola bw’atyo si y’ensonga.
And it’s not just an idea.	Era si kirowoozo kyokka.
He is so good to me.	Ye mulungi nnyo gyendi.
And maybe that was just fine.	Era oboolyawo ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
And that’s really important, that’s very important.	Era ekyo kikulu ddala, ekyo kikulu nnyo.
I need money to buy food.	Nneetaaga ssente okugula emmere.
Much worse than anyone thought.	Kibi nnyo okusinga omuntu yenna bwe yalowooza.
I’m sure it will work out just fine.	Nkakasa nti kijja kukola bulungi nnyo.
But that doesn’t matter.	Naye ekyo si kikulu.
Neither of them is.	Bombi si bwe bali.
It is very common.	Kya bulijjo nnyo.
He's not going.	Si y'agenda.
Whatever you want.	Kyonna ky’oyagala.
He is here and loves the work.	Ali wano era ayagala nnyo omulimu.
That’s my dad’s.	Ekyo kya taata wange.
I have to go.	Nnina okugenda.
He was a very nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo.
Until that night.	Okutuusa ekiro ekyo.
He felt happy.	Yawulira nga musanyufu.
There are many ways this can happen.	Waliwo engeri nnyingi kino gye kiyinza okubaawo.
I wanted to get a job in the city.	Nnali njagala kufuna mulimu mu kibuga.
He obviously doesn’t need much.	Kya lwatu nti teyeetaaga bingi.
You’re afraid of everything.	Otya buli kimu.
He has his own person.	Alina omuntu we.
I could imagine.	Nnali nsobola okulowooza.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
And what they are on now.	Era kye bali ku kati.
Back to the hospital.	Okudda mu ddwaaliro.
But it was worse than that.	Naye kyali kibi okusinga ekyo.
You have to do a lot of planning.	Olina okukola enteekateeka nnyingi.
Or else we should go.	Oba si ekyo tusaanidde okugenda.
He knows why he is there.	Amanyi lwaki ali eyo.
To me, it was a normal thing.	Eri nze, kyali kintu kya bulijjo.
I don’t know what time it is.	Simanyi ssaawa ki.
On the way.	Ku tugenda.
They were friendly.	Baali ba mukwano.
There is no work to be done.	Tewali mulimu gwa kukola.
But that’s true.	Naye ekyo kituufu.
Here we are right now.	Wano we tuli mu kiseera kino.
He knew it wouldn't last long, now.	Yali akimanyi nti tekijja kumala bbanga ddene, kati.
He won’t do it.	Tajja kukikola.
For absolutely nothing.	Ku kintu kyonna ddala.
That’s really good.	Ekyo kirungi ddala.
He was willing to do anything.	Yali mwetegefu okukola ekintu kyonna.
There is no work to be done.	Tewali mulimu gwa kukola.
I couldn’t do that now.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola kati.
Certainly not.	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
He is in his room.	Ali mu kisenge kye.
Would you like to go with me?	Wandyagadde okugenda nange?
There is no answer.	Tewali kuddamu.
I know where they are.	Nze mmanyi gye bali.
I have always been curious about this.	Bulijjo mbadde njagala okumanya ku nsonga eno.
He said that would be nice.	Yagamba nti ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
I feel like it is.	Mpulira nga bwe kiri.
No one here would do that.	Tewali muntu yenna wano yandikoze ekyo.
Or under him.	Oba wansi we.
Not the police, not the police.	Si poliisi, si poliisi.
I am just a human being.	Nze ndi muntu yekka.
All of us, all of us.	Ffenna ffenna.
He and she together.	Ye ne ye nga bali wamu.
I needed to talk to you.	Nnali nneetaaga okwogera naawe.
This is not easy for me to do.	Kino si kyangu gyendi okukola.
But not everything.	Naye si buli kimu.
Like he didn’t want anything.	Nga bwe yali tayagala kintu kyonna.
It’s good to be busy down here.	Kirungi okubeera bbize wansi wano.
I was going home.	Yali ngenda okudda eka.
He wants a child.	Ayagala mwana.
He was young.	Yali muto.
He wouldn't say anything, though.	Kyokka yali tagenda kwogera kintu kyonna.
I just want to say.	Njagala kwogera kyokka.
I can do it.	Nsobola okukikola.
I want to talk to him today.	Njagala okwogera naye leero.
But for now, it is.	Naye mu kiseera kino, kye kiri.
He did this.	Kino yakikola.
I don’t want anything.	Saagala kintu kyonna.
He could only see one guy.	Yali asobola okulaba ggaayi omu yekka.
I don’t want to be alone.	Saagala kubeera nzekka.
Not himself.	Si ye kennyini.
For this reason he certainly will.	Ku nsonga eno mazima ddala ajja kukikola.
However, there is no luck.	Kyokka tewali mukisa.
Why couldn’t he do anything? 	Lwaki yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna?
It will be there.	Kijja kuba awo.
But there is hope.	Naye waliwo essuubi.
Really on	Ddala ku .
And apparently not.	Era kirabika si bwe kiri.
I'm still not sure.	Nze n'okutuusa kati sikakasa.
He'll be here in the next hour.	Ajja kuba wano mu ssaawa ejja.
Now he was very sick.	Kati yali mulwadde nnyo.
No, no, no, no.	Nedda, nedda, nedda.
You certainly can.	Mazima ddala osobola.
No one behind.	Tewali muntu yenna emabega.
Everything is exactly as it was.	Buli kimu kiri ddala nga bwe kyali.
But it wasn’t him.	Naye si ye yali.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange asinga.
He said he thinks he can.	Yagambye nti alowooza nti asobola.
No one is coming or going.	Tewali ajja wadde agenda.
That would be him, he thought.	Oyo yandibadde ye, bwe yalowooza.
This is what he wanted.	Kino kye yali ayagala.
But not for much.	Naye si lwa bingi.
There is no normal time for me.	Tewali budde bwa bulijjo gyendi.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
I don’t know who else it could be.	Simanyi ani omulala ayinza okuba.
We needed it.	Twali twetaaga.
But in fact he had been.	Naye mu butuufu yali abadde.
I don't know what.	Simanyi ki.
Lots of stuff here.	Ebintu bingi wano.
It’s hard for me to answer that.	Kizibu gyendi okuddamu ekyo.
But it could be everything.	Naye kiyinza okuba nga buli kimu.
Now he knew.	Kati yali amanyi.
Now, that’s a good movie.	Kati, eyo firimu nnungi.
It’s a really bad idea.	Ddala kirowoozo kibi.
Not so today.	Si bwe kiri leero.
It’s up to us.	Kiri ku ffe.
I needed a car.	Nnali nneetaaga mmotoka.
No one wanted to see this.	Tewali yali ayagala kulaba kino.
I wanted more than anything from here.	Nnali njagala okusinga ekintu kyonna okuva wano.
Not much, really.	Si bingi, ddala.
He was having a problem.	Yali alina ekizibu.
I'll be back tomorrow.	Nja kudda enkya.
There are no faces.	Tewali maaso.
Being human is not a sin.	Okubeera omuntu si kibi.
This is a good thing.	Kino kintu kirungi.
But maybe he should.	Naye mpozzi yandibadde.
You have everything.	Olina buli kimu.
I'm in trouble.	Nze nfunye obuzibu.
I was the problem.	Nze nnali ekizibu.
But he wanted to say one thing.	Naye yali ayagala okwogera ekintu kimu.
This was definitely a bad idea.	Kino mazima ddala kyali kirowoozo kibi.
You’re doing well.	Okola bulungi.
Is that okay?.	Ekyo kiri bulungi?.
This is a very busy time for me.	Kino kiseera kya bbize nnyo gyendi.
We don’t have much time.	Tetulina budde bungi.
And he did for a while.	Era yakikola okumala akaseera.
He needs those things.	Ebintu ebyo yeetaaga.
Everything is very important.	Buli kimu kikulu nnyo.
He was the stronger of the two.	Ye yali asinga amaanyi mu bombi.
I have to say so many things.	Nnina okugamba nti ebintu bingi nnyo.
But this picture is what someone wanted.	Naye ekifaananyi kino omuntu kye yali ayagala.
He was trying to talk.	Yali agezaako okwogera.
Not like this morning.	Si nga enkya ya leero.
I feel better too.	Nange mpulira bulungi.
He can’t do it right, but he tries.	Tasobola kukikola bulungi naye agezaako.
He was talking to himself.	Yali ayogera yekka.
But mostly for myself.	Naye okusinga ku nze kennyini.
No, he has a reason.	Nedda, alina ensonga.
He really didn't know what to expect.	Mu butuufu yali tamanyi kye yali asuubira.
I think this is a good thing.	Ndowooza kino kintu kirungi.
It’s a really good feeling.	Ddala mpulira nnungi.
He would have to do it.	Yandibadde alina okukikola.
The food was excellent.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
To be with me.	Okubeera nange.
And maybe it was true.	Era mpozzi nga kyali kituufu.
And he probably needed help.	Era oboolyawo yali yeetaaga obuyambi.
It was a wonderful time.	Kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo.
The same is true of this.	Kye kimu ne kino.
I have a relationship problem.	Nnina obuzibu mu mukwano.
I don’t care about the man.	Sifaayo ku musajja.
And with reason, you might say.	Era nga waliwo ensonga, oyinza okugamba nti.
Very good, he thought.	Kirungi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
I think it is now.	Ndowooza bwe kiri kati.
That's why it's so important to do it right.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki kikulu nnyo okukikola obulungi.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
He went with her an hour ago.	Yagenda naye essaawa emu emabega.
I wonder now what will happen.	Nze nneebuuza kati kiki ekigenda okubaawo.
What a difficult experience!	Nga kizibu nnyo!
I’m not entirely sure.	Sikakasa ddala.
This is why.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki...
It is everywhere.	Kiri buli wamu.
My wife said maybe it was time to go home.	Mukyala wange yagamba nti osanga kye kiseera okudda eka.
He says he does it.	Agamba nti akikola.
Indeed.	Ddala ddala.
He was obviously on the side of the police.	Kya lwatu nti yali ku ludda lwa poliisi.
In case you don’t know.	Mu mbeera nga tomanyi.
He is fine now.	Ali bulungi kati.
The financial crisis.	Obuzibu bwa ssente.
He thought he was okay.	Yalowooza nti talina buzibu.
I have to get out of town.	Nnina okuva mu kibuga.
That’s what he had to do.	Ekyo kye yalina okukola.
It was a good thing he didn’t have.	Kyali kintu kirungi kye yali talina.
No, not close, not close, not close.	Nedda, si kumpi, si kumpi, si kumpi.
You certainly do.	Mazima ddala ggwe okola.
The problem is that.	Obuzibu buli nti.
She was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo, nga mulungi nnyo.
I want to, desperately.	Njagala, nga nfunye essuubi.
But there was a chance.	Naye nga waliwo omukisa.
He comes all right.	Ajja bulungi.
We were almost .	Twali kumpi .
That’s going to keep happening.	Ekyo kigenda kusigala nga kigenda mu maaso.
This thing is complicated.	Ekintu kino kizibu.
At home and in the office all morning.	Awaka ne mu ofiisi enkya yonna.
She needed help and it was urgent.	Yali yeetaaga obuyambi era nga ya bwangu.
This is happening, now.	Kino kigenda mu maaso, kati.
I don’t know why but it’s true.	Simanyi lwaki naye kituufu.
I know who he is.	Nze mmanyi ky’ali.
This is not the place.	Kino si kye kifo.
It’s just what’s happening.	Kye kyokka ekigenda mu maaso.
The way it looks.	Engeri gye kirabika.
A lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi.
What is that? 	Ekyo kye ki?
He had no interest himself.	Ye kennyini yali talina ky’ayagala.
This is really the problem.	Ddala kino kye kizibu.
That alone is not true.	Ekyo kyokka si kituufu.
Both were normal.	Bombi baali ba bulijjo.
He seemed to be doing.	Yalabika ng’akola...
Are you.	Ye ggwe.
Now, you don’t have to say anything to anyone.	Kati, tolina kwogera kintu kyonna eri muntu yenna.
What do you want?	Kiki ky’oyagala?
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
At this point, however, no one was going anywhere.	Kyokka mu kiseera kino tewali yali agenda yonna.
I think this is not true.	Ndowooza kino si kituufu.
I wanted to make one too.	Nange nnali njagala okukola emu.
He was supposed to be mine.	Yali alina okuba wange.
I really need to be there.	Nneetaaga nnyo okubaawo.
He's almost like here.	Ali kumpi nga wano.
Now he was here.	Kati yali wano.
I can really talk to you.	Ddala nsobola okwogera naawe.
It’s important to me.	Kikulu gyendi.
I think everyone can imagine how hard this is.	Ndowooza buli muntu asobola okulowooza ku ngeri kino gye kizibu.
My friend told me everything would be fine.	Mukwano gwange yang’amba nti buli kimu kijja kuba kirungi.
That, of course, is easier said than done.	Ekyo kya lwatu, kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
Perhaps he was working.	Oboolyawo yali akola.
He had no idea who it was.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku ani.
There is nothing complicated here.	Wano tewali kintu kizibu.
He thought what a good father would be.	Yalowooza nga taata omulungi bwe yandibadde.
I know it’s easier said than done.	Nkimanyi nti kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
Everything was so hard all the time.	Buli kimu kyali kizibu nnyo buli kiseera.
In fact, it won’t.	Mu butuufu, tekijja kukikola.
This can be an issue indeed.	Kino kiyinza okuba ensonga ddala.
He certainly knows every one of these.	Mazima ddala amanyi buli kimu ku bino.
And you won’t know.	Era tojja kumanya.
This is a very good one.	Eno nnungi nnyo.
I’ve always been good.	Bulijjo mbadde mulungi.
You know better than that.	Ggwe omanyi okusinga ekyo.
It's just my opinion.	Kirowoozo kyange kyokka.
He is my patient.	Ye mulwadde wange.
This is of course, not true.	Kino kya lwatu, si kituufu.
In that room.	Mu kisenge ekyo.
I have nothing or no one to live for.	Sirina kintu kyonna oba sirina gwe nnyinza kubeerawo.
He knew it was coming.	Yali akimanyi nti kijja.
Where we are.	Gye tuli.
We’ll go together.	Tujja kugenda ffembi.
And he was my brother.	Era yali muganda wange.
As in, at the moment.	Nga mu, mu kiseera kino.
That's why he's here.	Y'ensonga lwaki ali wano.
It’s a powerful thing.	Kintu kya maanyi.
To the reason.	Eri ensonga.
And, in any case.	Era, mu ngeri yonna.
I really want to go.	Njagala nnyo okugenda.
Reading is important for everyone.	Okusoma kikulu eri buli muntu.
You don’t want to go either.	Naawe toyagala kugenda.
Like, a good person.	Nga, omuntu omulungi.
However, it is not.	Kyokka si bwe kiri.
No maybe about that.	Nedda mpozzi ku nsonga eyo.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
I have nothing to do with that.	Ekyo sirina kye nnyinza kukola.
This is just so important.	Kino kikulu nnyo kyokka.
He was always very strong.	Bulijjo yali wa maanyi nnyo.
I used to live here.	Nze nnali mbeera wano.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
I’m going to see a movie.	Ngenda kulaba firimu.
It seems that.	Kirabika nga.
Like you right now.	Nga ggwe kati kati.
It’s a good movie though.	Firimu nnungi wadde.
I could have been .	Nnali nsobola okuba nga .
He didn’t have to do this.	Kino yali talina kukikola.
And it can be helpful.	Era kiyinza okuyamba.
I will have to do it myself.	Nja kuba nnina okukikola nze kennyini.
Not in anything.	Si mu kintu kyonna.
Do you think he will succeed?	Olowooza ajja kusobola?
That’s really not true.	Ekyo ddala si kituufu.
And it was easy to do.	Era kyali kyangu okukola.
He knew exactly what to say.	Yali amanyi bulungi ky’alina okwogera.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
This is not the case now.	Kino kati si bwe kiri.
But he thought it might be you.	Naye yalowooza nti oyinza okuba nga ye ggwe.
We could have known.	Twali tusobola okumanya.
He obviously couldn’t.	Kya lwatu yali tasobola.
He certainly couldn’t do that.	Mazima ddala ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
I could barely work.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kukola.
That was his point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga ye.
It looks good on you.	Kirabika bulungi ku ggwe.
But he thought so.	Naye yalowooza bw’atyo.
It is the same time.	Ye kiseera kye kimu.
I don’t care.	Sifaayo.
Obviously someone had.	Kya lwatu nti waliwo omuntu yalina.
And he had it too.	Era naye yalina.
He must go to the police.	Ateekwa okugenda ku poliisi.
The reason is for you.	Ensonga gy’oli.
Nobody really does.	Tewali muntu yenna ddala akola.
One knows the other.	Omu amanyi omulala.
It will be very difficult.	Kijja kuba kizibu nnyo.
It certainly was.	Mazima ddala bwe kyali.
It would be nice if it was you.	Kyandibadde kirungi singa oba ggwe.
You’re going to be fine.	Ogenda kuba bulungi.
I thought it was great.	Nalowooza nti kyali kirungi nnyo.
Or so soon as it may be immediate.	Oba amangu ennyo nga kiyinza okuba nga kya mangu.
He needs a car.	Yeetaaga mmotoka.
That’s what he did.	Bw’atyo bwe yakola.
We need his home.	Twetaaga awaka we.
Everyone knows it.	Buli omu akimanyi.
He did as he pleased.	Yakola nga bwe yali ayagala.
We can buy it.	Tusobola okugula.
Like really yesterday.	Nga ddala eggulo.
It’s a problem.	Kye kizibu.
You could do anything, there.	Oyinza okukola ekintu kyonna, eyo.
Not everyone can.	Si buli muntu nti asobola.
But it is much more important than that.	Naye kikulu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
Her boyfriend was nowhere near this.	Muganzi we yali talina we yali kumpi ne kino.
This whole thing.	Kino ekintu kyonna.
He knew it.	Yali amanyi.
Indeed,	Mazima ddala, .
This view is not an issue.	Endowooza eno si nsonga.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Simanyi kigenda mu maaso.
But he will be here.	Naye ajja kuba wano.
He's been here all weekend.	Abadde wano wiikendi yonna.
It’s still early.	Bukyali nga bukyali.
He couldn’t let this go on.	Kino yali tasobola kukkiriza kugenda mu maaso.
He can’t drive a car.	Tasobola kuvuga mmotoka.
It's a wedding.	Ye mbaga.
He didn't know where.	Yali tamanyi wa.
I guess we are too.	Ntebereza naffe bwe tuli.
I think he is.	Ndowooza ye.
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
He didn’t want to make money.	Yali tayagala kukola ssente.
Being so close.	Okubeera kumpi nnyo.
I should be.	Nze nsaanidde okuba.
He's always been so good to me.	Bulijjo abadde mulungi nnyo gyendi.
I didn’t have it.	Nze nnali sirina.
However, you will know better.	Kyokka, ojja kuba omanyi bulungi.
He doesn’t want help.	Tayagala buyambi.
I want another chance.	Njagala omukisa omulala.
To me the whole thing seems so simple and obvious.	Eri nze ekintu kyonna kirabika nga kyangu nnyo era nga kya lwatu.
He has his own opinion.	Alina endowooza ye.
I was so close.	Nali kumpi nnyo.
Or as good as.	Oba nga kirungi nga.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
We can’t do this.	Kino tetusobola kukikola.
You have to strike now.	Olina okukuba kati.
I’m glad you’re nearby.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli kumpi.
We have it in us.	Tulina mu ffe.
Now you’re not.	Kati ggwe toli.
He knows he could do it.	Akimanyi nti yali asobola okukikola.
He can’t really do that right now.	Mu butuufu tasobola kukola ekyo mu kiseera kino.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
Common.	Kya bulijjo.
No, you don’t have to.	Nedda, tolina.
What's the problem.	Kiki ekizibu.
For each case, .	Ku buli nsonga, .
No one has to know.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kumanya.
And we are us.	Era tuli ffe.
I'm so sorry	Nsonyiwa nnyo
That one is also very lovely.	Oyo naye ayagala nnyo.
I thought it was you.	Nalowooza nti ggwe.
He will come as one.	Ajja kujja nga omu.
That was good to see.	Ekyo kyali kirungi okulaba.
No one could believe it.	Tewali yali asobola kukkiriza.
I hope you are doing well.	Nsuubira nti okola bulungi.
That's really my whole point.	Eyo ddala nsonga yange yonna.
I really knew nothing about it.	Mazima ddala nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
This seems easier said than done.	Kino kirabika kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
Each of us.	Buli omu ku ffe.
He didn’t know what to believe.	Yali tamanyi kya kukkiriza.
And you have to be.	Era olina okuba.
I think you will too.	Ndowooza naawe ojja kukikola.
I’m not going anywhere with you.	Sirina gye ngenda naawe.
Maybe he doesn’t mind being alone with her.	Mpozzi nga talina buzibu kubeera naye yekka.
You are not what they are.	Ggwe toli kye bali.
It’s not my problem.	Si kizibu kyange.
The house is beautiful.	Ennyumba nnungi.
I doubt that will be easy.	Nbuusabuusa nti ekyo kijja kuba kyangu.
I don’t like it either.	Nange sikyagala.
You know you want to.	Omanyi nti oyagala.
Much, much, much more.	Bingi bingi nnyo.
This would be great.	Kino kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
We can go home.	Tusobola okudda eka.
I knew this could happen.	Namanya nti kino kiyinza okubaawo.
We are a human being.	Ffe tuli muntu.
But that’s me.	Naye oyo nze.
It was love.	Kyali kwagala.
But he couldn’t do it.	Naye yali tasobola kukikola.
And this is true.	Era kino kituufu.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
I hope you are okay with that.	Nsuubira nti ekyo oli bulungi.
I had no plans whatsoever.	Nnali sirina nteekateeka yonna.
He needed a lot of money immediately.	Yali yeetaaga ssente nnyingi mu bwangu.
This he had.	Kino yalina.
It won’t last long.	Tekijja kumala bbanga ddene.
How do you do it.	Okola otya.
Everything is normal.	Buli kimu kya bulijjo.
Any of us were.	Omuntu yenna ku ffe yali...
Please don’t come to me.	Nsaba tojja gyendi.
But he shouldn’t have worked without my knowledge.	Naye yali tasaanidde kukola nga simanyi.
We can’t stay.	Tetusobola kusigala.
That’s not what it is.	Ekyo si kye ki.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
I love his work.	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
He knew we were there.	Yali akimanyi nti tuli awo.
However, it is not local to me.	Kyokka si ya wano gyendi.
This is really simple.	Kino ddala kyangu.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
He could have everything now.	Yali asobola okufuna buli kimu kati.
Urgent.	Mangu.
We are friends too.	Naffe tuli ba mukwano.
He really did it.	Ddala yakikola.
I know you will.	Nkimanyi nti ojja kukikola.
This is one of those.	Kino kye kimu ku ebyo.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
Maybe all of that.	Mpozzi ebyo byonna.
One of us must speak up!	Omu ku ffe alina okwogera!
He couldn't stay much longer.	Yali tasobola kumala bbanga ddene nnyo.
It’s hard to know exactly where that is.	Kizibu okumanya ekyo ddala we kiri.
He works hard and does a good job.	Akola nnyo era akola omulimu mulungi.
I don’t think anyone can.	Sirowooza nti waliwo asobola.
That’s what we’re really here for.	Ekyo kye tuli wano ddala.
There is only one thing we have to do.	Ekintu kimu kyokka kye tulina okukola.
He certainly did his best.	Mazima ddala yakola kyonna kye yali asobola.
I think you’ll be fine.	Ndowooza ojja kuba bulungi.
No, this is not true.	Nedda, kino si kituufu.
You will be strong.	Ojja kuba wa maanyi.
It was absolutely beautiful.	Kyali kirungi nnyo ddala.
I can’t believe it.	Siyinza kukkiriza.
I hope we will be friends.	Nsuubira nti tujja kuba ba mukwano.
I’m happy here.	Nze wano ndi musanyufu.
I think it’s true.	Ndowooza nti kituufu.
He doesn't know why.	Tamanyi lwaki.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
He had the time.	Yalina obudde.
And he had it.	Era yalina.
It was a feeling he knew all too well.	Yali mpulira gye yali amanyi bulungi.
No one wants the truth.	Tewali ayagala mazima.
I feel it too.	Nange mpulira.
I guess that was lucky for them.	Ntebereza nti ekyo kyali kya mukisa gye bali.
But we can’t.	Naye tetusobola.
He can’t stay here.	Tasobola kusigala wano.
He needed to see.	Yali yeetaaga okulaba.
No one does it right.	Tewali akikola bulungi.
This coming week will be great.	Wiiki eno ejja ejja kuba nnungi nnyo.
You are a teacher.	Oli musomesa.
I just have no idea.	Nze sirina kirowoozo kyonna kyokka.
That book is good.	Ekitabo ekyo kirungi.
I think about my room.	Ndowooza ku kisenge kyange.
That's why we have to work.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tulina okukola.
He is in excellent condition.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
No one lived there now.	Kati tewali yali abeera eyo.
Better say no, she thought.	Kirungi okugamba nti nedda, bwe yalowooza.
He had been in this position before.	Yali abadde mu kifo kino emabegako.
I think everyone knows that.	Ndowooza ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
But there was no one in sight.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna alabika.
I have a friend and we will be fine.	Nnina mukwano gwange tujja kuba bulungi.
You can do anything.	Oyinza okukola ekintu kyonna.
I just know we will be together.	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti tujja kuba ffembi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He wasn’t very good.	Yali si mulungi nnyo.
This is a very real thing.	Kino kintu kya ddala nnyo.
He would probably do the same thing.	Oboolyawo yandikoze ekintu kye kimu.
That’s just true.	Ekyo kituufu kyokka.
He readily agreed.	Yakkiriza mangu.
You will have to be.	Ojja kuba olina okuba.
In truth, it wasn’t.	Mu mazima, si bwe kyali.
You were there.	Ggwe wali.
I'll stay here.	Nja kusigala wano.
It’s not lovely.	Si kya kwagala.
It’s probably too close.	Oboolyawo kiri kumpi nnyo.
I think it’s time.	Ndowooza kye kiseera.
Home at home.	Awaka awaka.
But you probably have too.	Naye oboolyawo naawe olina.
This is mostly but not entirely true.	Kino okusinga naye si kituufu ddala.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Yali amanyi bulungi kye yali akola.
I don’t care to go with anyone.	Nze sifaayo kugenda na muntu yenna.
What he did.	Kye yakola.
But tonight, you’re at work.	Naye ekiro kino, oli ku mulimu.
Or for the money.	Oba lwa ssente.
He's in the car.	Ali mu mmotoka.
And in that case .	Era mu mbeera eyo .
I’m here for this.	Nze ndi wano ku lwa kino.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
And it won’t happen.	Era tekijja kubaawo.
Don’t go to the hospital.	Togenda mu ddwaaliro.
I am very curious.	Njagala nnyo okumanya.
But, this isn’t so bad.	Naye, kino si kibi nnyo.
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
But he didn’t have it.	Naye yali talina.
But I can’t do it.	Naye sisobola kukikola.
He goes with me.	Agenda nange.
That’s where we’re going.	Eyo gye tugenda.
I'll be here.	Nja kuba wano.
There is never a dull moment.	Tewali kiseera kizibu kyonna.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kintu kibi.
And we are moving forward.	Era tugenda mu maaso.
That’s a lot of money.	Ekyo ssente nnyingi nnyo.
I wasn’t sure if it would work or not.	Nali sikakasa oba kijja kukola oba nedda.
No process, you said.	Tewali nkola, bwe wagamba.
No one knows for sure.	Tewali amanyi bulungi.
That was a little awkward.	Ekyo kyali kizibu katono.
I was now a man.	Nze kati nnali musajja.
And he is very into this.	Era ali nnyo mu kino.
You are a true friend.	Oli mukwano gwa ddala.
I don’t know what it is.	Simanyi kye kiri.
You’ll know.	Ojja kumanya.
Although it’s not me.	Wadde nga si nze.
What he saw was what was coming.	Kye yalaba kye kyali kijja.
This would be very important.	Kino kyandibadde kikulu nnyo.
I didn’t want much.	Nnali saagala bingi.
That's why you're my son.	Y'ensonga lwaki oli mwana wange.
I want to be strong.	Njagala kubeera wa maanyi.
I'll get in place.	Nja kufuna mu kifo.
He couldn’t see anything.	Yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
I can’t talk to him.	Sisobola kwogera naye.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
I think maybe she needs to get some help.	Ndowooza osanga yeetaaga okufuna obuyambi.
And he was there too.	Era naye yali awo.
It’s all I’m afraid of.	Byonna bye ntya.
But now you know.	Naye kati omanyi.
Why are you.	Lwaki oli.
You have the time.	Olina obudde.
It contains everything but him.	Mulimu buli kimu okuggyako ye.
For a while.	Okumala akaseera.
No one lived here.	Wano tewali yali abeera.
The hunger was intense.	Enjala eyo yali ya maanyi nnyo.
I don’t want to talk to him either.	Nange saagala kwogera naye.
It was time to do something already.	Kyali kiseera kya kukola kintu dda.
But he only wanted to do one thing.	Naye yali ayagala kukola kimu kyokka.
I'll go now.	Nja kugenda kati.
Nothing...	Tewali...
It was close but not quite.	Yali kumpi naye nga si nnyo.
No one knows exactly who he was.	Tewali amanyi bulungi ani gwe yali.
This will not work.	Kino tekijja kukola.
But he knew he had to go.	Naye yali akimanyi nti yalina okugenda.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
That is not true at all.	Ekyo si kituufu n’akatono.
He is an ordinary artist.	Ye muyimbi wa bulijjo.
He wanted to know what she was thinking.	Yali ayagala okumanya kye yali alowooza.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe yali.
It was indeed a beautiful thing.	Mazima ddala kyali kintu kirungi nnyo.
He must have come in a lot of money.	Ateekwa okuba nga yajja mu ssente nnyingi.
He reluctantly agreed.	Yakkiriza nga tayagala.
I think soon enough.	Ndowooza mu bbanga ttono.
He won’t do anything.	Tajja kukola kintu kyonna.
Sorry.	Nsonyiwa.
And now he has.	Era kati alina.
There is so much more.	Waliwo bingi nnyo.
I’m not the same.	Nze si bwe kiri.
This is not an opinion.	Eno si ndowooza.
I didn’t think anyone would.	Nnali sirowooza nti waliwo omuntu yenna ajja kukikola.
I don’t even want to do it.	Saagala na kukikola.
He was doing his job.	Yali akola omulimu gwe.
I am strong.	Ndi wa maanyi.
That is my opinion.	Ekyo kye ndowooza yange.
You have no idea how much.	Tolina kirowoozo ku ssente mmeka.
This is not your issue.	Eno si nsonga yo.
It was actually quite good.	Mu butuufu kyali kirungi nnyo.
It is very good to be.	Kirungi nnyo okubeera.
Not a little too much.	Si katono nnyo.
But we need to know.	Naye twetaaga okumanya.
That’s not a bad thing for me.	Ekyo si kibi gyendi.
But it is the same everywhere.	Naye buli wamu kye kimu.
I wonder if it’s true.	Nze nneebuuza oba kituufu.
It’s not a reasonable thing.	Si kya nsonga.
But it would also be dangerous.	Naye era kyandibadde kya bulabe.
I can see everything.	Nsobola okulaba buli kimu.
This is very, very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo nnyo.
So far, nothing out of the ordinary.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali kintu kya bulijjo.
Maybe you have a point.	Mpozzi olina ensonga.
You’ll be fine.	Ojja kuba bulungi.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
I will be good to you.	Nja kuba mulungi gyoli.
I’m here when you want to talk.	Nze ndi wano nga oyagala okwogera.
He is still beautiful as well.	Akyali mulungi nga bwe kiri.
No one said much.	Tewali yayogera bingi.
Like a movie.	Nga firimu.
I don’t want to talk to anyone right now.	Saagala kwogera na muntu yenna mu kiseera kino.
I love it so much.	Nze njagala nnyo.
I'm not exactly sure.	Sikakasa bulungi ddala.
And it really isn’t.	Era ddala si bwe kiri.
Now every day.	Kati buli lunaku.
I didn’t have that kind of time.	Nnali sirina budde bwa ngeri eyo.
I was thinking.	Nali ndowooza.
Good to be here with me!.	Kirungi okubeera wano nange!.
From now on, this is a relationship.	Okuva kati, guno gwa mukwano.
Of course, it isn’t.	Kya lwatu, si bwe kiri.
But not in a good way.	Naye si mu ngeri nnungi.
But only one.	Naye omu yekka.
I’m not in this for the money.	Siri mu kino lwa ssente.
He had no idea.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna.
I know why.	Nkimanyi lwaki.
I couldn’t wait to get back to the police station.	Nali siyinza kulinda kudda ku poliisi.
Here we are.	Wano we tuli.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
I think.	Ndowooza.
Nothing was the same.	Tewali kyali nga bwe kyali.
He wanted to do his job.	Yali ayagala kukola mulimu gwe.
But, without the same.	Naye, nga tewali kye kimu.
But I feel like it is.	Naye mpulira nga bwe kiri.
We can’t do it here.	Tetusobola kukikola wano.
I know you are a good person.	Nkimanyi nti oli muntu mulungi.
I'm not so sure.	Sikakasa bulungi nnyo.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
He has power, too.	Alina amaanyi, naye.
No one knew anything.	Tewali yali amanyi kintu kyonna.
He will go with you.	Ajja kugenda naawe.
He is ready to work.	Mwetegefu okukola.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
And no one needed it.	Era tewali yali yeetaaga.
He was a very nice guy.	Yali ggaayi mulungi nnyo.
And he had it.	Era yalina.
Together, we really can achieve more.	Nga tuli wamu, ddala tusobola okutuuka ku bingi.
Not in this room, right now, in this place.	Si mu kisenge kino, mu kiseera kino, mu kifo kino.
I have no idea why he left.	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki yagenda.
We have anything and everything.	Tulina ekintu kyonna na buli kimu.
This is actually quite simple.	Kino mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
In fact, he did.	Mu butuufu, yakikola.
He didn’t know what they were.	Yali tamanyi kye baali.
And he will do it.	Era ajja kukikola.
We have help.	Tulina obuyambi.
Nothing,' he said suddenly.	Tewali kintu kyonna,’ bwe yagamba mu bwangu.
You don’t know exactly.	Tomanyi bulungi.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
That one is not happy though.	Oyo si musanyufu wadde.
But he isn’t.	Naye si bw’atyo.
I thought you knew.	Nalowooza nti omanyi.
As it is in me.	Nga bwe kiri mu nze.
He wants to tell the truth.	Ayagala kwogera mazima.
I knew that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi.
Who's there? 	Ani ali eyo?
I think he needs to do that a little bit.	Ndowooza ekyo yeetaaga okukikola katono.
I was a schoolteacher.	Nnali musomesa wa ssomero.
Which she looked great.	Kye yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
Everyone was also very friendly.	Buli omu naye yali wa mukwano nnyo.
I was very happy about that.	Ekyo nnali musanyufu nnyo.
It’s easy for them.	Kyangu gye bali.
You want to be yourself.	Ggwe oyagala kubeera ggwe kennyini.
The food is good.	Emmere nnungi.
You have a problem.	Olina ekizibu.
That was his favorite way.	Eyo ye ngeri gye yali ayagala ennyo.
One week at a time.	Wiiki emu emu.
Someone has to speak up.	Omuntu alina okwogera.
It’s there but it’s not.	Kiri awo naye si bwe kiri.
He can do anything.	Asobola okukola buli kimu.
That’s what we’ll do.	Ekyo kye tujja okukola.
He might have been asleep.	Yandiba nga yali yeebase.
He knew that, but it was an opinion, really.	Ekyo yali akimanyi, naye kyali ndowooza, ddala.
I want to be in the here and now.	Njagala kubeera mu wano ne kati.
No one can be you better than you.	Tewali ayinza kuba ggwe okusinga ggwe.
My brother said the same thing.	Muganda wange yayogera ekintu kye kimu.
That can be a challenge.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
And .	Era .
But there’s nobody there.	Naye tewali muntu yenna awo.
He loved to read.	Yali ayagala nnyo okusoma.
Everything and everyone will come back.	Buli kimu na buli muntu ajja kudda.
But that wasn’t the point of this weekend.	Naye eyo si ye yali ensonga ya wiikendi eno.
You can do the same thing.	Naawe osobola okukola ekintu kye kimu.
He makes a point.	Akola ensonga.
He is still very sick.	Akyali mulwadde nnyo.
I go to his room.	Ngenda mu kisenge kye.
It could be anything.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
Now this is the point.	Kati eno y’ensonga.
I like to think about those.	Njagala nnyo okulowooza ku ebyo.
I know they’re there.	Nkimanyi nti bali awo.
Nothing seemed to matter.	Tewali kyali kirabika nga kikulu.
For everything they were.	Ku buli kimu kye baali.
He had to do it.	Yalina okukikola.
You’re not the same.	Ggwe si bwe kiri.
Now is as good a time as ever.	Kati kiseera kirungi nga buli kiseera.
His friend was there.	Mukwano gwe yali awo.
That was normal.	Ekyo kyali kya bulijjo.
This was certainly the case.	Mazima ddala kino bwe kyali.
He did very well.	Yakola bulungi nnyo.
He is still young.	Akyali muto.
And there are so many more.	Era bingi nnyo.
I don’t have many interests.	Sirina bingi bye njagala.
And he didn’t know what to do.	Era yali tamanyi kya kukola.
I don't even care. 	Sifaayo wadde. 
He is really good.	Ye mulungi ddala.
Do you work? 	Okola?
. . . .	.
I won’t tell anyone.	Sijja kubuulira muntu yenna.
I’m going into a relationship.	Nze ngenda mu mukwano.
A week ago my brother comes to me.	Wiiki emu emabega muganda wange ajja gyendi.
Not even driving a car.	Si wadde okuvuga mmotoka.
You have a good job.	Olina omulimu omulungi.
It could be anyone.	Kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
There was no way he could do it.	Tewali ngeri yonna gye yali asobola kukikola.
He was ready.	Yali mwetegefu.
He wasn’t happy.	Yali si musanyufu.
I am not the same.	Nze siri kye kimu.
The food was really good.	Emmere yali nnungi ddala.
That's, like, local.	Ekyo, nga, kya wano.
This is why it is what it is.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki kye kiri.
He is not an ordinary man.	Si musajja wa bulijjo.
I still can’t believe it.	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kukkiriza.
We have a dog.	Tulina embwa.
You know you can.	Omanyi nti osobola.
No one does it.	Tewali akikola.
It’s pretty easy to see why.	Kyangu nnyo okulaba lwaki.
We can help!.	Tusobola okuyamba!.
Really young, too.	Ddala muto, naye.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Kyokka, si kikulu.
Of course, that’s not unusual.	Kya lwatu, ekyo si kya bulijjo.
I think this is largely true.	Ndowooza kino okusinga kituufu.
So it is with everyone.	Bw’atyo bw’atyo eri buli muntu.
But he is happy.	Naye musanyufu.
He said, very good.	Yagamba nti, kirungi nnyo.
There were things he wanted to know.	Waliwo ebintu bye yali ayagala okumanya.
He didn't even know what he'd do if he did.	Yali tamanyi na kye yandikoze singa akikola.
But that’s just not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
I knew it was going to happen.	Namanya nti kigenda kubaawo.
They are one and the same.	Bali kimu era kye kimu.
In fact, there are so many.	Mu butuufu, waliwo bingi nnyo.
And that’s something.	Era ekyo kintu.
Back to work.	Okudda ku mulimu.
I feel at home.	Mpulira nga ndi waka.
I just want you.	Nze njagala ggwe kyokka.
Not even to me.	Si wadde gyendi.
He says he says it’s not him, but.	Agamba agamba nti si ye, naye...
He always has.	Bulijjo abadde alina.
It’s time to go to school.	Kye kiseera okugenda ku ssomero.
He's a little younger.	Ali muto katono.
Do you think he's coming at me?	Olowooza ajja ku nze?
I am a normal person.	Nze ndi wa bulijjo.
She looked great, but not very happy.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo, naye nga si musanyufu nnyo.
You can watch here, here, and here.	Osobola okulaba wano, wano, ne wano.
There’s one for you too.	Naawe waliwo emu gy’oli.
He doesn’t know that we are.	Tamanyi nti ffe.
I should have thought one finished.	Nnali nsaanidde okulowooza nti emu ewedde.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
Not to anything, nor from anything.	Si eri ekintu kyonna, wadde okuva ku kintu kyonna.
My father is trying to work.	Taata agezaako okukola.
Nothing seemed to matter.	Tewali kyali kirabika nga kikulu.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Naye nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eyo.
I’m the same.	Nze kye kimu.
And we are, too.	Era naffe tuli.
I was expecting this.	Kino nnali nsuubira.
I wanted to get real with you.	Nnali njagala kufuna ddala naawe.
I will be that guy.	Nze nja kuba ggaayi oyo.
This is my job going forward.	Guno gwe mulimu gwange okugenda mu maaso.
I want to know what is going on here.	Njagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso wano.
You have it.	Ggwe olina.
I knew that was why.	Nnali nkimanyi nti eyo y’ensonga lwaki.
What we have a problem with.	Kye tulina ekizibu.
He is not a morning person.	Si muntu wa makya.
You won’t have any problems.	Tojja kufuna buzibu bwonna.
I want to know why.	Njagala okumanya lwaki.
I have to say.	Nnina okugamba.
He had it now.	Yalina kati.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu ng'ekyo.
However, that is not the point.	Kyokka, ekyo si kye kikulu.
Obviously, you are not.	Kya lwatu nti ggwe si bwe kiri.
Someone has to do it.	Omuntu alina okukikola.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
It will continue to happen if you go.	Kijja kugenda mu maaso nga kigenda mu maaso singa ogenda.
It was good for me.	Kyali kirungi gyendi.
I have nothing bad to say about it.	Sirina kibi kye nnyinza kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
This is urgent.	Kino kya mangu.
He didn’t want to go to the hospital.	Yali tayagala kugenda mu ddwaaliro.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange asinga.
Can you eat yet?	Osobola okulya n’okutuusa kati?
However, maybe that would be fine.	Kyokka, mpozzi ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
You are more of a man than he is.	Oli musajja okusinga ye.
And you certainly have.	Era mazima ddala olina.
But he isn’t.	Naye si bw’atyo.
But maybe that’s a good thing.	Naye mpozzi ekyo kintu kirungi.
You will stay here.	Ojja kusigala wano.
I want what it actually is.	Njagala kye kiri mu butuufu.
He spoke for a long time.	Yayogera okumala ebbanga ddene.
That’s true, about everything.	Ekyo kituufu, ku buli kimu.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
Beauty includes.	Obulungi mulimu.
But it’s going on.	Naye kigenda mu maaso.
He's been here before.	Abadde wano emabegako.
I couldn’t see who it was but there was someone.	Nali sisobola kulaba ani naye nga waliwo omuntu.
You certainly can’t.	Mazima ddala tosobola.
Everyone knew, of course.	Buli omu yali akimanyi, ddala.
And that’s a problem.	Era ekyo kizibu.
He's going well.	Agenda bulungi.
And so he had.	Era naye bwe yalina.
He wouldn’t have been able to do it.	Yandibadde tasobola kukikola.
He was the one who was speaking.	Ye yali ayogera.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
I’m really feeling it.	Nze mpulira ddala.
He had hope.	Yalina essuubi.
I loved those things.	Ebintu ebyo nnali njagala nnyo.
He is what he is.	Ye ky’ali.
This is certainly true.	Kino mazima ddala kituufu.
But no, it was real.	Naye nedda, kyali kya ddala.
We are what we are.	Ffe tuli kye tuli.
Everyone is happy.	Buli omu musanyufu.
This is a beautiful place.	Kino kifo kirungi nnyo.
In fact, that is not the case.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si bwe kiri.
It was really good.	Ddala kyali kirungi.
He's not good.	Si mulungi.
To me, but you know, not really.	Eri nze, naye omanyi, si ddala.
The dog was asleep.	Embwa yali yeebase.
I don’t know who did it.	Simanyi ani yakikola.
This isn’t just an idea, this is reality.	Kino si kirowoozo kyokka, kino kya ddala.
Quick and fast.	Amangu era amangu.
It will be there tonight.	Kijja kuba awo ekiro kino.
I couldn’t go anywhere.	Nnali sisobola kugenda yonna.
We have one here too.	Naffe tulina emu wano.
And the same problem appeared.	Era ekizibu kye kimu ne kirabika.
You know this to be true.	Kino okimanyi nti kituufu.
He is always on time.	Bulijjo abeera mu budde.
I don’t want to wait.	Saagala kulinda.
He loves to swim.	Ayagala nnyo okuwuga.
He did just that.	Yakola bw’atyo.
He is not here today.	Tali wano leero.
This house is beautiful.	Ennyumba eno nnungi nnyo.
He's fine.	Ali bulungi.
I know what the problem is.	Nze mmanyi obuzibu bwe buli.
As in, one.	Nga mu, emu.
It is very low.	Kiri wansi nnyo.
It’s not too dangerous.	Si kya bulabe nnyo.
But he could do that.	Naye ekyo yali asobola okukikola.
He knows everything.	Buli kimu akimanyi.
This is a bit complicated.	Kino kizibu katono.
To do these things.	Okukola ebintu bino.
It seems so simple.	Kirabika nga kyangu nnyo.
You will do it	Ojja kukikola
So he thought he was good.	Bwatyo yalowooza nti yali mulungi.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
It could be you or me.	Ayinza okuba ggwe oba nze.
Not all anyone could see.	Si kyonna omuntu yenna kye yali asobola okulaba.
I don’t think he will though.	Sirowooza nti ajja kukikola wadde.
Not really, really.	Si ddala, ddala.
He was just afraid.	Yali atya kyokka.
It won’t be easy.	Tekijja kuba kyangu.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Mpozzi nga si kikulu.
That’s the way it is.	Ekyo bwe kiri.
I want it here right now.	Njagala wano mu kiseera kino.
He could do anything.	Yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
Everyone has their own opinion.	Buli muntu alina endowooza ye.
Where have you been?	Obadde wa?
This is happening very quickly.	Kino kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
It was everywhere, in the air.	Kyali buli wamu, mu bbanga.
And his wife.	Ne mukyala we.
We both are, apparently.	Ffembi tuli, kirabika.
I knew it wasn’t the point.	Namanya nti si y’ensonga.
He may be here.	Ayinza okuba wano.
There is no way.	Tewali ngeri yonna.
Everyone mostly knows this.	Buli muntu okusinga kino akimanyi.
It’s not as easy as it sounds.	Si kyangu nga bwe kirabika.
No one really knows.	Tewali amanyi ddala.
Obviously, this is a problem.	Kya lwatu nti kino kizibu.
We have a job to do.	Tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
He had many interests.	Yalina ebintu bingi bye yali ayagala.
In any case.	Mu mbeera yonna.
I have to know.	Nnina okumanya.
No, it really isn’t.	Nedda, ddala si bwe kiri.
Maybe you should go with him?	Mpozzi wandibadde ogenda naye?
He couldn't say anything.	Yali tasobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
He wanted to be with her.	Yali ayagala kubeera naye.
But now he would do the same.	Naye kati yandikoze kye kimu.
This is a beautiful place.	Kino kifo kirungi nnyo.
There is nothing to do with time.	Tewali kya kukola budde.
This is not the same.	Kino si kye kimu.
Now, anyway.	Kati, mu ngeri yonna.
I can’t tell anyone.	Siyinza kubuulira muntu yenna.
But there’s a point to that.	Naye waliwo ensonga ku ekyo.
Not the way it seems.	Si ngeri gye kirabika.
I think he can do whatever he wants.	Ndowooza asobola okukola kyonna ky’ayagala.
I thought you should know.	Nalowooza nti olina okumanya.
I know where he lived.	Nze mmanyi gye yali abeera.
Now he lives alone.	Kati abeera yekka.
He was obviously very strong.	Kya lwatu nti yali wa maanyi nnyo.
Please hit that.	Nsaba okukuba ekyo.
What's the problem.	Kiki ekizibu.
My house is nearby.	Ennyumba yange eri kumpi awo.
See? 	Okulaba?
How are you.	Oli otya.
He is really friendly!.	Ye wa mukwano ddala!.
Good to know.	Kirungi okumanya.
But this will never happen.	Naye kino tekijja kubaawo.
Very nice car.	Mmotoka nnungi nnyo.
You are a doctor.	Oli musawo.
He certainly couldn’t.	Mazima ddala yali tasobola.
Maybe, not always.	Mpozzi, si bulijjo.
I need to do that.	Ekyo nneetaaga okukikola.
He didn't know what he was thinking.	Yali tamanyi kye yali alowooza.
But maybe that was the point.	Naye oboolyawo eyo ye yali ensonga.
It wasn’t, of course.	Si bwe kyali, ddala.
That’s what we are.	Ekyo kye tuli.
But not about this.	Naye si ku nsonga eno.
The picture is in good condition.	Ekifaananyi kiri mu mbeera nnungi.
I have no feelings about it.	Sirina mpulira yonna ku nsonga eyo.
She would have to talk to him about it.	Yandibadde alina okwogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
I'm aware of it.	Nze nkimanyi.
Probably, but not necessarily.	Oboolyawo, naye si kituufu.
Now is the time to speak up.	Kati kye kiseera okwogera.
This is normal.	Kino kya bulijjo.
Exactly the same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu ddala.
However, he did.	Kyokka, yakikola.
He won’t do it.	Tajja kukikola.
I was very happy at home.	Nali musanyufu nnyo awaka.
A lot of.	Ebintu bingi.
And he has knowledge.	Era alina okumanya.
But that’s not very good.	Naye ekyo si kirungi nnyo.
Always,’ he said.	Bulijjo,’ bwe yagambye.
But he needed time to think.	Naye yali yeetaaga obudde okulowooza.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
Back to such a time.	Okudda mu kiseera ng’ekyo.
He will know what we need.	Ajja kumanya kye twetaaga.
He told me he didn’t know.	Yang’amba nti tamanyi.
I knew you’d want time with him.	Namanya nti ojja kwagala obudde naye.
He goes very fast and safe.	Agenda mangu nnyo era talina bulabe.
I knew whatever he said it would be.	Nali nkimanyi nti kyonna kye yayogera kye kijja okuba.
His wife's house.	Ennyumba ya mukyala we.
I’m just a kid.	Nze ndi mwana muto yekka.
You have to have it.	Olina okuba nga olina.
But that is much easier in theory than in practice.	Naye ekyo kyangu nnyo mu ndowooza okusinga mu nkola.
There is a way to deal with that.	Waliwo engeri y’okukola ku ekyo.
But it’s not my preference.	Naye si kyange kye njagala.
You, too, don’t have to know everything.	Naawe, tolina kumanya buli kimu.
I don’t want to know anything.	Saagala kumanya kintu kyonna.
He probably had his reasons.	Oboolyawo yalina ensonga ze.
That’s what you want, too.	Ekyo naawe ky’oyagala.
I love having you here.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe wano.
I can’t quite believe it.	Siyinza bulungi kukkiriza.
It’s as bad as it can be.	Kibi nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
I know this is true.	Nkimanyi nti kino kituufu.
He had a home.	Yali alina awaka.
He was powerless.	Yali talina maanyi.
But he couldn’t.	Naye yali tasobola.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
I had no time or thought.	Nnali sirina budde wadde okulowooza.
He was happy to get his phone.	Yali musanyufu okufuna essimu ye.
Maybe reading.	Mpozzi okusoma.
From these.	Okuva bino.
But that’s not my point.	Naye ekyo si nsonga yange.
I’m fine with this.	Nze kino ndi bulungi.
It would be bad for both of us.	Kyandibadde kibi gye tuli ffembi.
I know there’s a lot.	Nkimanyi nti waliwo bingi.
No, it’s not good.	Nedda, si kirungi.
He is not due back until last week.	Talina kudda okutuusa wiiki ewedde.
I think he was real too.	Ndowooza naye yali wa ddala.
That was it for me.	Ekyo kye kyali gyendi.
He could make food out of anything and nothing.	Yali asobola okukola emmere mu kintu kyonna era nga talina kintu kyonna.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo yakikola.
It will continue into next week.	Kigenda kugenda mu maaso okutuuka mu wiiki ejja.
But he didn’t think he would.	Naye yali talowooza nti ajja kukikola.
You would love it though.	Wandyagadde nnyo wadde.
The reason we cannot know.	Ensonga tetusobola kumanya.
I want his son.	Njagala mwana we.
You make the point.	Ggwe okola ensonga.
It’s going to be hard in any case.	Kigenda kuba kizibu mu mbeera yonna.
He wasn’t that kind of person.	Yali si wa ngeri eyo.
Apparently it isn’t.	Kirabika si bwe kiri.
We were very busy.	Twali bbize nnyo.
We can’t do that.	Ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
My house.	Ennyumba yange.
He was one of us.	Yali omu ku ffe.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
What do we have here?	Kiki kye tulina wano?
Not a little bit.	Si katono katono.
I was both of them.	Nze nali bombi.
It felt so good, she thought.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
That’s not the issue here.	Eyo si y’ensonga wano.
That’s not the case with me.	Ekyo si bwe kiri gyendi.
It’s not serious.	Si kya maanyi.
However, that is not the case everywhere.	Kyokka ekyo si bwe kiri buli wamu.
It was his money.	Yali ssente ze.
I know that’s a thing.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo kintu.
This is the reason why.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki.
It’s just us.	Ffe kyokka.
I think it was real.	Ndowooza kyali kya ddala.
But it was difficult.	Naye nga kizibu.
Do you have the time?	Olina obudde?
I said that.	Nagamba nti.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
And then he knew what he had to do.	Era awo n’amanya kye yalina okukola.
It’s not true.	Si mazima.
But obviously it is very difficult.	Naye kya lwatu nti kizibu nnyo.
This is my opinion.	Kino kye ndowooza yange.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
But no one wanted to go.	Naye tewali yali ayagala kugenda.
And he is also a delight to work with.	Era naye musanyufu nnyo okukola naye.
I don’t think so.	Sirowooza nti.
Either way I couldn’t.	Mu ngeri yonna nnali sisobola.
That goes for his work.	Ekyo kigenda ku mulimu gwe.
That was a serious problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I don’t like it a bit.	Sikyagala katono.
I can't say what.	Siyinza kwogera ki.
Until he is.	Okutuusa nga ye.
I really like that one.	Njagala nnyo eyo.
But he would if he could.	Naye yandikoze singa yali asobola.
He could buy whatever he wanted.	Yali asobola okugula kyonna kye yali ayagala.
I have no problem with this.	Kino sirina buzibu bwonna.
It’s what we are.	Kye kye tuli.
What you want.	Kye oyagala.
It was a school class.	Yali kibiina kya ssomero.
I don't care which way.	Sifaayo ngeri ki.
I've always been .	Bulijjo nze .
It’s going to be around for a little while.	Kigenda kubeerawo akaseera katono.
He had no answer for that.	Ekyo yali talina kya kuddamu.
How could he be.	Yandibadde atya.
It was real.	Kyali kya ddala.
I just need to talk to you.	Nze nneetaaga kwogera naawe kyokka.
Now that’s how it was.	Kati bwe kyali.
He wanted to go.	Yali ayagala kugenda.
Maybe it’s nothing.	Mpozzi nga tewali kintu kyonna.
I hope you knew it too.	Nsuubira nti naawe wali okimanyi.
Maybe he could think with her.	Mpozzi yali asobola okulowooza naye.
Of course, everyone wants to be a doctor.	Kya lwatu nti buli muntu ayagala kubeera musawo.
That was what he expected.	Ekyo kye yali asuubira.
No, they are not.	Nedda, si bwe bali.
I need to get home.	Nze nneetaaga okutuuka awaka.
Was it	Yali ye .
It was as simple as that.	Kyali kyangu nga ekyo.
And maybe not doing well at that.	Era mpozzi obutakola bulungi ku ekyo.
But now.	Naye kati.
You have to go.	Olina okugenda.
He couldn't do what he needed to do down here.	Yali tasobola kukola kye yali yeetaaga kukola wansi wano.
Apparently that wasn’t the case.	Kirabika ekyo si bwe kyali.
And maybe there, we'll have another chance.	Era mpozzi eyo, tujja kufuna omukisa omulala.
It had to happen.	Kyalina okubaawo.
He couldn’t do more than that.	Yali tasobola kukola bingi okusinga ekyo.
You’re going to stay here.	Ogenda kusigala wano.
What was he going to do about it?.	Yali agenda kukikola ki?.
You can move on.	Osobola okugenda mu maaso.
I know it’s hard.	Nkimanyi nti kizibu.
I don’t have time.	Sirina budde.
It was.	Yali...
No one can do that.	Ekyo tewali asobola kukikola.
The weather is still very nice.	Obudde bukyali bulungi nnyo.
Not too much, but a little.	Si bingi nnyo, naye katono.
He makes plans.	Akola enteekateeka.
But it wasn’t, it wasn’t, it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali, si bwe kyali, si bwe kyali.
But that’s what it is.	Naye ekyo kye kiri.
This is my room.	Kino kye kisenge kyange.
This is absolutely true.	Kino kituufu ddala.
It is very accurate.	Kituufu nnyo.
But there is no one there.	Naye tewali muntu yenna eyo.
I’m the only one here.	Nze nzekka ali wano.
I know he has one.	Nkimanyi nti alina emu.
However, this picture is beautiful.	Kyokka ekifaananyi kino kirungi nnyo.
He was fast asleep.	Yali yeebase nnyo.
We’ll be back this afternoon.	Tugenda kudda akawungeezi ka leero.
Me too.	Nange.
No one at home but me.	Tewali muntu yenna waka okuggyako nze.
Everyone knows everything.	Buli muntu amanyi buli kimu.
He will see that.	Ajja kulaba ekyo.
There is hope though.	Waliwo essuubi wadde.
I thought we would.	Nalowooza nti tugenda...
He is sick, but not too sick.	Mulwadde, naye si mulwadde nnyo.
I don’t know their exact location.	Simanyi kifo kituufu we bali.
He's fine.	Ali bulungi.
I can’t tell if this is the case.	Sisobola kumanya oba kino bwe kiri.
Easier said than done.	Kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
Or he should have known.	Oba yandibadde amanyi.
And he wanted her too.	Era yali ayagala naye naye.
Spending time with you.	Okumala obudde naawe.
We are, of course.	Ffe tuli, ddala.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
Well not, well no.	Kirungi si bwe kiri, kirungi nedda.
That, in a sense, he was.	Ekyo, mu ngeri emu, kye yali.
He may, or he may not.	Ayinza, oba nedda.
He talked him and us out of it.	Yayogera naye naffe okuva mu nsonga eyo.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
Already thinking, she thought.	Nga alowooza dda, bwe yalowooza.
I wanted to see what you were doing.	Nnali njagala okulaba kye wali okola.
It’s hard to read on a daily basis.	Kizibu okusoma ku buli lunaku.
Whoever was supposed to be behind everything.	Oyo yenna gwe yali ateekwa okuba emabega wa buli kimu.
It’s not as hard as it sounds.	Si kizibu nga bwe kirabika.
What would that be.	Ekyo kyandibadde ki.
Hour after hour.	Ssaawa ku ssaawa.
That's why it's important.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki kikulu.
Or as it is.	Oba nga bwe kiri.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I didn’t even know what to say.	Nali simanyi na kya kwogera.
I’m going alone.	Nze ngenda nzekka.
He had no plans.	Yali talina nteekateeka yonna.
And it’s not a problem.	Era si kizibu.
I don’t think this is true.	Kino sirowooza nti kituufu.
She was young and beautiful.	Yali muto era nga mulungi nnyo.
And they are.	Era bwe bali.
All right, here we go.	Kirungi, wano we tugenda.
I need to make a phone call.	Nze nneetaaga okukuba essimu.
That is my situation.	Ekyo kye mbeera yange.
With no return.	Nga tewali kudda.
Perhaps you can help.	Oboolyawo oyinza okuyamba.
This afternoon, we’re going to see a movie.	Akawungeezi ka leero, tugenda kulaba firimu.
I know it .	Nze nkimanyi .
It’s going on.	Kigenda mu maaso.
Of course, he would.	Kya lwatu nti yandikoze.
That’s neither here nor there.	Ekyo si wano wadde awo.
He just couldn’t.	Yali tasobola kyokka.
What a beautiful car.	Nga mmotoka nnungi nnyo.
Except here, he was closer.	Okuggyako wano, yali asinga kumpi.
More than anything.	Okusinga ekintu kyonna.
He was young.	Yali muto.
This is very important now.	Kino kikulu nnyo kati.
He had been busy.	Yali abadde bbize.
And it’s not good.	Era si kirungi.
Not his room, either.	Si kisenge kye, era.
I know so many things.	Nze mmanyi ebintu bingi nnyo.
We have no idea what it is.	Tetulina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki.
I didn’t want to be one.	Nnali saagala kubeera omu.
But today is the day.	Naye leero lwe lunaku.
I think you have a problem.	Ndowooza olina ekizibu.
Not everyone, of course.	Si buli muntu, ddala.
That’s where we are today.	Awo we tuli leero.
Everything seems normal.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
The only person he knew.	Omuntu yekka gwe yali amanyi.
Went to dinner.	Yagenda okulya ekyeggulo.
You’re a man.	Oli musajja.
We are here and we have a job to do.	Tuli wano era tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
Good, he thought.	Kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
It’s difficult.	Kizibu.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
He is the only one who is better.	Ye yekka asinga obulungi.
We can’t stay.	Tetusobola kusigala.
Going to work.	Okugenda ku mulimu.
The food was ready.	Emmere yali ewedde.
I'm sure you know.	Nkakasa nti okimanyi.
I didn’t know you were here, in the house.	Nali simanyi nti oli wano, mu nnyumba.
He works hard for his money.	Akola nnyo ku ssente ze.
I'll have to think about that.	Nja kuba nnina okulowooza ku ekyo.
It’s in the house.	Kiri mu nnyumba.
He was ready to go.	Yali mwetegefu okugenda.
It had to be something.	Yalina okuba ekintu.
It’s up to him.	Kiri ku ye.
I have no idea why.	Nze sirina kye mmanyi lwaki.
It is very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo.
He was still that man.	Yali akyali musajja oyo.
You have to do well.	Olina okukola obulungi.
Now he knew this would never happen.	Kati yali akimanyi nti kino tekijja kubaawo.
It’s not entirely your business.	Si nsonga yo yonna.
I honestly can’t speak now.	Mu butuufu sisobola kwogera kati.
I actually loved it.	Mu butuufu nnali njagala nnyo.
The problem is you.	Obuzibu ggwe.
I knew there was.	Namanya nti waliwo.
I knew he wouldn’t come back.	Namanya nti tajja kudda.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
No one really knows.	Tewali amanyi ddala.
Things like this.	Ebintu nga bino.
You will have to know.	Ojja kuba olina okumanya.
But he has my thing.	Naye alina ekintu kyange.
My son it’s okay.	Mwana wange kiri bulungi.
We are all powerless.	Ffenna tetulina maanyi.
We can definitely do this!.	Kino tusobola okukikola ddala!.
And it was really bad.	Era kyali kibi ddala.
He began to study under her.	Yatandika okusoma wansi we.
This is very important to do.	Kino kikulu nnyo okukola.
It was a normal thing.	Kyali kintu kya bulijjo.
Not that he needed to.	Si nti yali yeetaaga okukikola.
I am very happy to be here.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano.
I know this will never happen.	Nkimanyi kino tekijja kubaawo.
But it is not	Naye si bwe kiri .
And we’re here to help.	Era tuli wano okuyamba.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
He did everything we needed him to do.	Yakola buli kye twali twetaaga okukola.
Right now.	Kati.
I can’t tell anyone.	Siyinza kubuulira muntu yenna.
Now you will be.	Kati ggwe ojja kuba.
We need to know who we really are.	Tulina okumanya kye tuli ddala.
Really.	Kituufu.
What? 	Kiki?
He knew what he was doing.	Yali amanyi kye yali akola.
But he has.	Naye alina...
Everyone seems to talk about that time.	Buli omu alabika ayogera ku kiseera ekyo.
She is younger than him, but not by much.	Muto okusinga ye, naye si lwa bingi.
It was a bedroom.	Yali kisenge kya kisenge.
Are you okay?	Oli bulungi?
He must go himself.	Ateekwa okugenda ye kennyini.
It’s a difficult thing.	Kintu kizibu.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
Obviously not for you.	Kya lwatu si gy’oli.
Very good though.	Kirungi nnyo wadde.
I'm sure it would work.	Nkakasa nti yandikoze.
It looks good to me.	Kirabika bulungi gyendi.
He came right at us.	Yajja ddala ku ffe.
No such luck here.	Tewali mukisa nga guno wano.
I just wanted to know what was going on.	Nnali njagala kumanya kigenda mu maaso kyokka.
It’s not the right thing to do.	Si kye kituufu.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
the father said.	taata bwe yagamba.
Honestly, you have no idea.	Mu butuufu, tolina kirowoozo kyonna.
I don't really care.	Sifaayo ddala.
All of that, of course, you can and should do.	Ekyo kyonna, kya lwatu, osobola era olina okukikola.
No reason and nothing.	Tewali nsonga era tewali kintu kyonna.
No problems so far.	Tewali buzibu bwonna okutuusa kati.
In a way, he always was.	Mu ngeri emu, bulijjo yali.
You should have come too.	Naawe wandibadde ojja.
I’m going in the morning.	Nze ngenda ku makya.
We have to do that.	Ekyo tulina okukikola.
But no, it’s not him.	Naye nedda, si ye.
It seems realistic.	Kirabika nga kya ddala.
As he was.	Nga bwe yali.
Probably not good.	Oboolyawo si kirungi.
It would be.	Kyandibadde.
And no, that's not even it.	Era nedda, ekyo si kye kiri wadde.
I love that you can work.	Njagala nnyo nti osobola okukola.
There is no way whatsoever.	Tewali ngeri yonna yonna.
He always comes and always has.	Bulijjo ajja era bulijjo alina.
For a moment, he could see nothing.	Okumala akaseera katono, yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
Not even with this.	Si wadde ne kino.
Or my own thing.	Oba ekintu kyange.
Overthinking is a thing of the past.	Okulowooza ennyo kintu kya dda.
But no one knew what to do.	Naye tewali yali amanyi kya kukola.
I wanted money anyway.	Nnali njagala ssente mu ngeri yonna.
I certainly knew where they were.	Mazima ddala nnali mmanyi gye baali.
However, not at the same time.	Kyokka si mu kiseera kye kimu.
Everyone was very friendly.	Buli omu yali wa mukwano nnyo.
But you can do things for that.	Naye ekyo osobola okukola ebintu.
Now, he did it.	Kati, yakikola.
No one can say this.	Tewali muntu ayinza kwogera bino.
Very nice!.	Kirungi nnyo!.
I want to be human.	Njagala kubeera muntu.
Probably not one or the other.	Oboolyawo si omu oba omulala.
Now it’s my chance.	Kati gwe mukisa gwange.
He knows he is unlucky.	Akimanyi nti talina mukisa.
But we have to do it.	Naye tulina okukikola.
It was the same thing.	Kyali kintu kye kimu.
That’s really great.	Ekyo ddala kirungi nnyo.
It’s so important to be yourself	Kikulu nnyo okubeera ggwe kennyini
You can just say you know.	Oyinza okumala okugamba nti omanyi.
Now we are here.	Kati tuli wano.
Now he had a lot of money.	Kati yalina ssente nnyingi nnyo.
From me.	Okuva ku nze.
It will be very dangerous.	Kijja kuba kya bulabe nnyo.
There is no place to live.	Tewali kifo kya kubeera.
This is the reason why.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki.
And now this.	Era kati kino.
I know he can.	Nkimanyi nti asobola.
I will be doing things from here on out.	Nja kuba nkola ebintu okuva wano okuva kati.
My father had so many plans.	Taata yalina enteekateeka nnyingi nnyo.
It comes at a high cost.	Ejja ku ssente nnyingi.
And, yes, his car was in it.	Era, ye, mmotoka ye yali mu yo.
You have to make one.	Olina okukola emu.
I’m sure he’ll be fine.	Nkakasa nti ajja kuba bulungi.
I don’t know what it is.	Simanyi kye kiri.
This was very quick and easy to do.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo era kyangu okukola.
But he was just a nice guy, a really nice guy.	Naye yali ggaayi mulungi yekka, ggaayi mulungi ddala.
If only he were good.	Singa yali mulungi.
You know exactly why.	Omanyi bulungi lwaki bwe kiri.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
This is definitely good.	Kino mazima ddala kirungi.
And there are so many reasons.	Era waliwo ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
Why do you need to know?	Lwaki olina okumanya?
It actually belongs to my dad.	Mu butuufu kya taata wange.
I know it’s not much.	Nkimanyi nti si bingi.
You can do what you want with him.	Osobola okukola naye ky’oyagala.
At the same time nothing was the same.	Mu kiseera kye kimu tewali kyali kye kimu.
I’ve got a good job.	Nfunye omulimu omulungi.
That wasn’t the issue.	Eyo si ye yali ensonga.
Where he’s going and he’s doing well.	Gye agenda okugenda era akola bulungi.
We'll be back tomorrow.	Tugenda kudda enkya.
Nothing was good.	Tewali kyali kirungi.
It is much worse than that.	Kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
This is great for us in this situation.	Kino kirungi nnyo gye tuli mu mbeera eno.
He must be a very good friend of mine.	Ateekwa okuba mukwano gwange omulungi ennyo.
I like to gain knowledge.	Njagala nnyo okufuna okumanya.
Not as bad as it could have been.	Si kibi nga bwe kyandibadde.
No one could do it.	Tewali yali asobola kukikola.
It was simple, but good.	Kyali kyangu, naye nga kirungi.
I was happy to do it.	Nnali musanyufu okukikola.
We can talk about anything.	Tusobola okwogera ku kintu kyonna.
It’s happening, right now.	Kigenda mu maaso, mu kiseera kino.
We are the strong ones.	Ffe tuli ba maanyi.
I want to know he’s going to be okay.	Njagala okumanya nti agenda kuba bulungi.
That is what will happen.	Ekyo kye kijja okubaawo.
I was myself.	Nze nali nze kennyini.
One knew what it looked like.	Omu yali amanyi engeri gye kyali kirabika.
We certainly have.	Mazima ddala tulina.
I wanted to know how I was doing.	Nnali njagala okumanya engeri gye nnali nkola.
Nothing was the same as before.	Tewali kyali nga bwe kyali emabegako.
This can happen for many reasons.	Kino kiyinza okubaawo ensonga nnyingi.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
He is a good man.	Musajja mulungi.
She really should have gone to school.	Ddala yandibadde agenda ku ssomero.
Maybe you think it’s really me, and maybe it is.	Mpozzi olowooza nti nze ddala, era mpozzi bwe kiri.
Definitely going to jail.	Mazima ddala okugenda mu kkomera.
That is not the case at all.	Ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
But just about.	Naye kumpi kyokka.
In the way we need.	Mu ngeri gye twetaaga.
That’s where they are tonight.	Awo we bali ekiro kino.
That's why he was in office for so long.	Y'ensonga lwaki yali mu ofiisi ebbanga ddene.
He wasn’t going home.	Yali tagenda waka.
Not really had time to do it though.	Si ddala yafuna budde kukikola wadde.
Nobody wanted that one.	Oyo tewali yali ayagala.
Maybe he was asleep.	Mpozzi nga yeebase.
This was a bad idea.	Kino kyali kirowoozo kibi.
I hope you’re not leaving already!	Nsuubira nti togenda dda!
Day in and day out.	Olunaku ku lunaku.
You work very, very hard.	Okola nnyo nnyo.
He just didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala kyokka.
But there was nothing he could do.	Naye nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola.
And this is the case.	Era kino bwe kiri.
As if there is only one book.	Nga bwe kiri nti waliwo ekitabo kimu kyokka.
He was doing a lot.	Yali akola bingi.
But now, he is my best friend.	Naye kati, ye mukwano gwange asinga.
I was in trouble.	Nnali nfunye ekizibu.
And that was what he needed now.	Era ekyo kye yali yeetaaga kati.
Will be back soon.	Ajja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
His achievement was excellent.	Ekintu kye yakola kyali kirungi nnyo.
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okuba nga yakikola.
But that is not the case now.	Naye kati si bwe kiri.
You know that problem.	Omanyi ekizibu ekyo.
Exactly the same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu ddala.
That will remain the case.	Ekyo kijja kusigala nga bwe kiri.
He knew he didn’t want to.	Yali akimanyi nti tayagala.
There is nothing unusual about this.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo ku nsonga eno.
We’re going to do it.	Tugenda kukikola.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
What.	Kiki.
In this case, it’s fine.	Mu mbeera eno, kirungi.
However, that is definitely not true.	Kyokka, ekyo mazima ddala si kituufu.
I know it seems like a lot.	Nkimanyi kirabika nga bingi.
I knew nothing about this process.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku nkola eno.
Work, he said.	Omulimu, bwe yagambye.
He did a good job at this point.	Yakola omulimu mulungi mu kiseera kino.
He talks a lot about his work.	Ayogera nnyo ku mulimu gwe.
I didn’t want to.	Nnali saagala.
He must have known that.	Ekyo ateekwa okuba nga yali akimanyi.
It was an idea.	Yali ndowooza.
I think they are.	Ndowooza bwe bali.
Everyone tried to move on.	Buli omu yagezaako okugenda mu maaso.
Actually no, it’s not.	Mu butuufu nedda, si bwe kiri.
This could be anything.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
That’s the problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu.
And we really can’t go anywhere.	Era ddala tetusobola kugenda yonna.
And now he knew what they were.	Era kati yali amanyi kye baali.
I think it is him.	Ndowooza nti ye ye.
He's like that.	Ye bw'atyo.
It’s actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
I can do that, no problem.	Ekyo nsobola okukikola, tewali buzibu.
Day in and day out.	Olunaku ku lunaku.
But he needed to do it.	Naye yali yeetaaga okukikola.
But we have, and we can.	Naye tulina, era tusobola.
For three hours. 	Okumala essaawa ssatu. 
Doing this is dangerous as well.	Okukola kino kya bulabe nga bwe kiri.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
He couldn’t tell.	Yali tasobola kumanya.
And he did it too.	Ne ye yakikola.
Or with me.	Oba nange.
I'll try to talk to him tomorrow.	Nja kugezaako okwogera naye enkya.
He had been like that even as a child.	Yali abadde bw’atyo ne bwe yali akyali mwana muto.
Can't say anything yet.	Tasobola kwogera kintu kyonna n'okutuusa kati.
I know that very well.	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi nnyo.
You know you shouldn’t be here.	Omanyi tolina kubeera wano.
But mostly me.	Naye okusinga nze.
He loves it here.	Ayagala nnyo wano.
For that one, nothing.	Ku oyo, tewali kintu kyonna.
This was a serious thing.	Kino kyali kintu kya maanyi.
Everything	Buli kintu
But everyone has it.	Naye buli omu alina.
This is completely normal.	Kino kya bulijjo ddala.
And it isn’t.	Era si bwe kiri.
What an idea.	Nga kirowoozo.
Either way, it will happen.	Mu ngeri yonna, kijja kubaawo.
It could be the same for you.	Kiyinza okuba kye kimu gy’oli.
He had time for everyone.	Yalina obudde bwa buli muntu.
I'll see to that.	Nja kulaba ekyo.
That’s exactly what it is.	Ekyo ddala bwe kiri.
It’s actually something.	Mu butuufu kintu.
I can’t quite believe it myself.	Nze kennyini sisobola bulungi kukkiriza.
He will be coming with us.	Ajja kuba ajja naffe.
Home at home.	Awaka awaka.
This, even today, is not the case.	Kino, ne leero, si bwe kiri.
This is simply not true.	Kino si kituufu kyokka.
You know you’re beautiful.	Omanyi nti oli mulungi.
I work every day.	Nkola buli lunaku.
I love your office.	Njagala nnyo ofiisi yo.
Until that hour, anything can happen.	Okutuusa mu ssaawa eyo, ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo.
He's there.	Ali eyo.
It’s not a very important thing.	Si kintu kikulu nnyo.
True, and yet not quite true.	Kituufu, era naye nga si kituufu nnyo.
That’s going on.	Ekyo kigenda mu maaso.
My dog ​​will stay with me.	Embwa yange ejja kusigala nange.
Not very much at all.	Si nnyo nnyo.
This will always be you.	Kino kijja kuba ggwe bulijjo.
He was a city guy.	Yali ggaayi wa kibuga.
This is not easy at all.	Kino si kyangu n’akatono.
I feel like a child.	Mpulira nga ndi mwana muto.
He did it.	Yakikola.
I have to get home.	Nnina okutuuka awaka.
I don’t want her one.	Saagala ye emu.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nnali simanyi kye kyali.
I don’t know when or how or why.	Simanyi ddi oba ngeri ki oba lwaki.
But he is not dangerous.	Naye si wa bulabe.
Person to person.	Omuntu eri omuntu.
Either way, he should try.	Mu ngeri yonna, yandibadde agezaako.
But you have it.	Naye ggwe olina.
He went into himself.	Yagenda mu ye kennyini.
I have to leave this city.	Nnina okuva mu kibuga kino.
I wanted to say.	Nnali njagala okugamba.
It’s not hard to see why.	Si kizibu kulaba nsonga lwaki.
But they really are.	Naye ddala bali.
But for my friend here.	Naye ku mukwano gwange wano.
Or not much right now.	Oba si bingi mu kiseera kino.
He can’t find a job.	Tasobola kufuna mulimu.
I know what he wants.	Nze mmanyi ky’ayagala.
But it wasn’t what he expected.	Naye si ye yali asuubira.
It’s not being without reason.	Si kubeera nga tewali nsonga.
That’s just true.	Ekyo kituufu kyokka.
My father had to work.	Taata yalina okukola.
Like he said, he’s not going any younger.	Nga bwe yagambye, tagenda muto.
We were in his room.	Twali mu kisenge kye.
There isn’t much time.	Tewali budde bungi.
Which we’re going to do in the background.	Kye tugenda okukola emabega.
I'm glad he's not in that.	Ndi musanyufu nti tali mu ekyo.
You have to arrive in the morning.	Olina okutuuka ku makya.
I think this is exactly what it is.	Ndowooza kino ddala kye kiri.
He must have known.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali akimanyi.
He would have been unable to speak.	Yandibadde tasobola kwogera.
He had no reason why.	Yali talina nsonga lwaki.
But there wasn’t much of that.	Naye nga tewali nnyo ku ebyo.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
It would be like now.	Yandibadde nga kati.
It was a very important thing.	Kyali kikulu nnyo.
I think everyone should too!.	Ndowooza buli muntu naye yandibadde!.
With this book.	Nga tulina ekitabo kino.
This is my classroom.	Kino kye kibiina kyange.
, not me.	, si nze.
Not nearly as much as it should be.	Si kumpi nnyo nga bwe yandibadde.
It’s not a car.	Si mmotoka.
This is not the only one.	Kino si kye kyokka.
Everyone is fine.	Buli omu ali bulungi.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
Not bad.	Si kibi.
He is currently afraid to work.	Mu kiseera kino atya okukola omulimu.
He said it wouldn't work.	Yagambye nti tekijja kukola.
He's just better than me today.	Asinga nze leero kyokka.
Anybody in anybody.	Omuntu yenna mu muntu yenna.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
In fact, I have.	Mu butuufu nnina.
He came into the house.	Yajja mu nnyumba.
I wanted him to do anything and everything.	Nnali njagala akole ekintu kyonna na buli kimu.
They are everywhere, he said.	Bali buli wamu, bwe yagambye.
Maybe, just maybe.	Mpozzi, mpozzi kyokka.
You have to make that movie.	Firimu eyo olina okukola.
And not like he always had.	Era si nga bwe yalina bulijjo.
Really, he shouldn’t.	Ddala, tasaanidde kukikola.
But he’s not here right now, and neither are you.	Naye tali wano mu kiseera kino, era naawe oli.
Maybe it would be better.	Mpozzi kyandibadde kirungi.
. . . .	.
This was to make money again.	Kino kyali kya kuddamu kukola ssente.
No problem.	Tewali buzibu.
That was what he needed.	Ekyo kye yali yeetaaga.
He began to think about it again.	Yatandika okuddamu okulowooza ku nsonga eno.
He must answer.	Ateekwa okuddamu.
He loves my brother.	Ayagala nnyo muganda wange.
The point is that it is not serious.	Ensonga eri nti si ya maanyi.
And then you yourself will go.	Era awo ggwe kennyini ojja kugenda.
But your dog.	Naye embwa yo.
in.	mu.
He would probably be a wonderful father.	Oboolyawo yandibadde taata omulungi ennyo.
I don’t know what to make of the whole thing.	Simanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo yonna.
To or.	Eri oba.
He comes to me.	Ajja gye ndi.
But he was young.	Naye yali muto.
You'll have to watch.	Ojja kuba olina okulaba.
Although perhaps not.	Wadde mpozzi si bwe kiri.
However, it doesn’t matter it doesn’t matter.	Kyokka, si kikulu si kikulu.
Now he is sick.	Kati mulwadde.
But he knew no one.	Naye tewali muntu yenna gwe yali amanyi.
He was in school.	Yali mu ssomero.
I won’t be without any problems.	Sijja kuba tewali buzibu bwonna.
I’m sure that wasn’t the case.	Nkakasa nti ekyo si bwe kyali.
I couldn’t believe it when she told me.	Nali siyinza kukkiriza bwe yang’amba.
The same thing every day.	Ekintu kye kimu buli lunaku.
You work on what you want.	Okola ku ky’oyagala.
I don’t think it’s a strategy to do that.	Sirowooza nti nkola ya kukola ekyo.
It’s not really the same thing.	Mu butuufu si kintu kye kimu.
He said that.	Yagamba bw’atyo.
He is obviously sick.	Kya lwatu nti mulwadde.
Everyone says this.	Buli omu ayogera bino.
I know that was very dangerous for you.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo kyali kya bulabe nnyo gy’oli.
It’s really easy.	Kyangu ddala.
It is not right to do that.	Si kituufu okukola ekyo.
That’s very good indeed.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo ddala.
His plan worked well.	Enteekateeka ye yakola bulungi.
I have been at this problem for a long time.	Mbadde ku kizibu kino okumala ebbanga ddene.
No one wants this.	Kino tewali ayagala.
I knew he would.	Nnali nkimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
Any one at all.	Omu yenna n’akatono.
There is only here.	Waliwo wano kyokka.
Or from here.	Oba okuva wano.
He knew he couldn’t.	Yali akimanyi nti tasobola.
I thought it was pretty obvious.	Nalowooza nti kyali kya lwatu nnyo.
Get.	Okufuna.
This, it seems, was a pivotal moment.	Kino, kirabika kyali kiseera kikulu nnyo.
He was too busy to talk.	Yali bbize nnyo nga tasobola kwogera.
He is just a human being.	Ye muntu yekka.
But this is only true.	Naye kino kituufu kyokka.
I don’t want to do these things.	Ebintu bino saagala kukola.
It’s a really, really, really good thing.	Kintu kirungi ddala, ddala, ddala kirungi.
That was a very common thing.	Ekyo kyali kintu kya bulijjo nnyo.
He was alone in the room.	Yali yekka mu kisenge.
I hope you don’t mind waiting.	Nsuubira nti tolina buzibu kulinda.
But very well.	Naye bulungi nnyo.
We were fine.	Twali bulungi.
No one could speak.	Tewali yali asobola kwogera.
It doesn’t matter at all.	Si kikulu n’akatono.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He thought it was him.	Yalowooza nti ye yali.
You have to do the work.	Olina okukola omulimu.
That morning.	Enkya eyo.
Now I have one.	Kati nnina emu.
We have the power.	Tulina amaanyi.
It was a sin.	Kyali kibi.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
She is really happy there.	Ddala ali musanyufu eyo.
He will never drive anything again.	Tajja kuddamu kuvuga kintu kyonna.
You can talk to him.	Oyinza okwogera naye.
This book comes in handy.	Ekitabo kino kijja mu nkola.
It wasn’t his place.	Si kye kyali kifo kye.
And that’s why you’re not ready.	Era y’ensonga lwaki toli mwetegefu.
It doesn’t really matter though.	Si kikulu nnyo wadde.
He didn't know the answer.	Yali tamanyi kya kuddamu.
He.	Ye.
But it is the truth.	Naye kye kituufu.
I am a morning person.	Ndi muntu wa makya.
You know what it’s like down there.	Omanyi bwe kiri wansi awo.
He wanted to drive a car.	Yali ayagala kuvuga mmotoka.
I work hard.	Nkola nnyo.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
That's why it's there.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki kiri awo.
You could say they were.	Oyinza okugamba nti baali.
However, I couldn’t.	Kyokka nnali sisobola.
Everyone should have a friend like him.	Buli muntu alina okuba ne mukwano gwe nga ye.
The very best answer.	Okuddamu okusinga obulungi ennyo.
My father was his best friend.	Taata yali mukwano gwe asinga.
But there is plenty of food.	Naye waliwo emmere nnyingi.
To do something.	Okukola ekintu.
Another has to read.	Omulala alina okusoma.
He was happy for his friend.	Yali musanyufu ku lwa mukwano gwe.
How much is this for?	Kino kya ssente mmeka?
He knew what he wanted to say.	Yali amanyi kye yali ayagala okwogera.
But he has something about him.	Naye alina ky’alina ku ye.
Not together, of course.	Si wamu, ddala.
It was true in a way.	Kyali kituufu mu ngeri emu.
No, he was not well.	Nedda, yali talina bulungi.
That’s just not the case.	Ekyo kyokka si bwe kiri.
But this is not.	Naye kino nedda.
It’s not something of anything.	Si kintu kya kintu kyonna.
I guess they still aren’t.	Ntebereza nti n’okutuusa kati si bwe bali.
Very easy, of course.	Kyangu nnyo, ddala.
This is a beautiful wedding.	Guno mbaga nnungi nnyo.
But no one tried to do it.	Naye tewali yagezaako kukikola.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna, tewali kintu kyonna, tewali kintu kyonna.
I could have gone on.	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu maaso.
I am working at home.	Ndi nkola waka.
It will remain as simple, or perhaps easier.	Kijja kusigala nga kyangu nga bwe kiri, oba oboolyawo nga kyangu.
I don’t want any trouble.	Saagala buzibu bwonna.
I’m my guy now.	Nze ggaayi wange kati.
He said he needed more time.	Yagambye nti yeetaaga obudde bungi.
And no one is doing anything about it.	Era tewali akola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
As he was.	Nga bwe yali.
You think about it.	Ggwe olowooza.
The other was a guy doing reading.	Omulala yali ggaayi akola okusoma.
We can only move forward.	Tusobola okugenda mu maaso kyokka.
Maybe that will help.	Mpozzi ekyo kijja kuyamba.
Whatever happens, will happen.	Kyonna ekigenda okubaawo, kijja kuba.
He knew how to do that well.	Ekyo yali amanyi bulungi okukikola.
I'm really afraid not.	Nze ddala ntya si bwe kiri.
But he probably does.	Naye oboolyawo akola bw’atyo.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
He said he didn’t really want to.	Yagamba nti yali tayagala nnyo.
You have been my true friend.	Obadde mukwano gwange ddala.
I won’t know.	Sijja kumanya.
Maybe his whole week.	Mpozzi wiiki ye yonna.
I feel so lucky to be here.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa nnyo okubeera wano.
The plan was awkward.	Enteekateeka eno yali ya buzibu.
I actually feel strong.	Mu butuufu mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi.
And it’s so bad.	Era kibi nnyo.
I was good to you.	Nze nali mulungi gyoli.
He was always busy.	Bulijjo yali bbize.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I can only imagine why.	Nsobola okulowooza ku nsonga lwaki.
I was my own man.	Nze nali musajja wange.
That’s the problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu.
You can do this your way.	Kino osobola okukikola mu ngeri yo.
Nothing is going to come back.	Tewali kigenda kuddamu.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
His point was a good one.	Ensonga ye yali nnungi.
He had me.	Yalina nze.
However, I won’t.	Kyokka sijja kukikola.
I can’t do it alone though.	Sisobola kukikola nzekka wadde.
It doesn’t matter who or where they are.	Si kikulu ani oba gye bali.
It worked fine for a while.	Yakola bulungi okumala akaseera.
But today it is not easy.	Naye leero si kyangu.
I think it was.	Ndowooza bwe kyali.
He talks about everything.	Ayogera ku buli kimu.
He did it anyway.	Yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
He was also a good friend of mine.	Era yali mukwano gwange mulungi.
But the night was very difficult.	Naye ekiro kyali kizibu nnyo.
That would be a bad thing.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi.
Although he was young, he was very strong.	Wadde yali muto, yali wa maanyi nnyo.
I don’t want anything .	Nze saagala kintu kyonna .
It’s better to do without.	Kirungi okukola nga tolina.
Thinking about luck.	Okulowooza ku mukisa.
He was there, of course.	Yali awo, ddala.
I’m not sure anyone else really can.	Sikakasa nti ddala waliwo omuntu omulala asobola.
It was just a problem.	Yali kizibu kyokka.
I think it is.	Ndowooza bwe kiri.
It was his city.	Kyali kibuga kye.
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
He won’t be at the house.	Tajja kubeera ku nnyumba.
Of course, this is not the problem.	Kya lwatu nti kino si kye kizibu.
It was a good time for me.	Kyali kiseera kirungi gyendi.
This or nothing.	Kino oba tewali.
He's there, picture and all.	Ali awo, ekifaananyi ne byonna.
It will happen.	Kijja kubaawo.
This was true.	Kino kyali mazima.
From the front.	Okuva mu maaso.
I just needed to know.	Nze nnali nneetaaga okumanya kyokka.
But nothing like this was happening.	Naye tewali kintu nga kino kyali kigenda mu maaso.
I am sure my good friend.	Nkakasa mukwano gwange omulungi.
Someone has to know.	Omuntu alina okumanya.
He is a good person.	Ye muntu mulungi.
Very good at that.	Kirungi nnyo mu ekyo.
Actually, it’s pretty simple.	Mu butuufu, kyangu nnyo.
This is what it was.	Kino kye kyali.
I can get it.	Nsobola okufuna.
That you are	Nti oli .
I guess his plan was coming together.	Ntebereza enteekateeka ye yali ejja wamu.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo.
Maybe not for long.	Mpozzi si okumala ebbanga ddene.
There is nothing to eat.	Tewali kya kulya.
It’s not so easy .	Si kyangu nnyo .
Can help in here.	Asobola okuyamba mu wano.
But what about you? 	Naye otya?
No prayer is no prayer.	Nsaba si ye nsaba si ye.
And yet, no one wanted to know.	Era naye, tewali yali ayagala kumanya.
He was going to be a doctor, a good job.	Yali agenda kubeera musawo, omulimu omulungi.
I guess you want something from me.	Ntebereza nti waliwo kyoyagala okuva gyendi.
Now he doesn’t want to play at all.	Kati tayagala kuzannya n’akatono.
We’ll eat together.	Tujja kulya ffenna.
We have a job to do.	Tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Simanyi kigenda kubaawo.
That will do for now.	Ekyo kijja kukola kati.
I was there you know.	Nze nali awo omanyi.
That will never really happen.	Ekyo tekijja kubaawo ddala.
How clearly she could see that night.	Engeri gye yali asobola okulaba obulungi ekiro ekyo.
How was he to know?	Yali wa kumanya atya?
No one does it.	Tewali akikola.
But for me it was just right.	Naye nze kyali kituufu nnyo.
He will try.	Ajja kugezaako.
He went quickly.	Yagenda mu bwangu.
I don’t have time to be sick.	Sirina budde bwa kubeera mulwadde.
Not in this case though.	Si mu mbeera eno wadde.
This is a labor of love.	Guno mulimu gwa kwagala.
Any of us would do.	Omuntu yenna ku ffe yandikoze.
He has already applied for the job.	Yasaba dda omulimu guno.
None of us would do anything.	Tewali kintu kyonna ku ffe kye yandikoze.
Neither man spoke.	Tewali musajja yenna yayogera.
I have been.	Mbadde.
You will probably win.	Oboolyawo ojja kuwangula.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
You are too good to talk about anything.	Oli mulungi nnyo okwogera ku kintu kyonna.
In this case, everyone got what they wanted.	Mu mbeera eno, buli muntu yafuna kye yali ayagala.
Really? 	Kituufu?
It will be back tomorrow.	Kigenda kudda enkya.
For many applications.	Ku nkola nnyingi.
That would be very important.	Ekyo kyandibadde kikulu nnyo.
He is in the hospital.	Ali mu ddwaaliro.
He is very strong.	Ali wa maanyi nnyo.
One cannot live in this state.	Omuntu tasobola kubeera mu mbeera eno.
I didn’t know what to do.	Nnali simanyi kya kukola.
You have a problem now!	Olina ekizibu kati!
But to himself alone.	Naye eri ye yekka.
No, no it won’t happen.	Nedda, nedda tekijja kubaawo.
He has to get out of that situation.	Alina okuva mu mbeera eyo.
Not to me.	Si gyendi.
It seems right to me.	Kirabika kituufu gyendi.
He knew how to talk to her.	Yali amanyi okwogera naye.
It was going to happen.	Kyali kigenda kubaawo.
Everyone has been here.	Buli omu abadde wano.
You can eat well all over the city.	Osobola okulya obulungi mu kibuga kyonna.
We really need to talk.	Ddala twetaaga okwogera.
And you are .	Era ggwe oli .
This is certainly not true.	Mazima ddala kino si kituufu.
This was realistic.	Kino kyali kya ddala.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
I need to do that with you.	Ekyo nneetaaga okukikola naawe.
Although he knows better.	Wadde nga amanyi bulungi.
I can’t do this.	Kino sisobola kukikola.
That’s where it is.	Eyo gye kiri.
He didn't know what to make of it all.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola ku byonna.
I had come up with a plan that would work.	Nnali nfunye enteekateeka ejja okukola.
You’ve been here before, haven’t you?	Obadde wano emabegako, si bwe kiri?
You said you were sure.	Wagamba nti okakasa.
My job is to.	Omulimu gwange.
And he doesn’t have time.	Era talina budde.
I hear things.	Mpulira ebintu.
That will work.	Ekyo kijja kukola.
Probably a sin.	Oboolyawo kibi.
But there is only so much we can do.	Naye waliwo bingi nnyo bye tusobola okukola.
She likes to be in her room.	Ayagala nnyo okubeera mu kisenge kye.
Or that we are all the same.	Oba nti ffenna tuli kimu.
No harm there.	Tewali bulabe bwonna awo.
It won’t last long for me.	Tekijja kumala bbanga ddene gyendi.
But, it was very important.	Naye, kyali kikulu nnyo.
That’s what we all need.	Ekyo ffenna kye twetaaga.
You have to work, too.	Naawe olina okukola.
That was easy to get.	Ekyo kyali kyangu okufuna.
Nothing had to do with it.	Tewali kyalina kukikola.
I don’t want to do that.	Ekyo saagala kukikola.
Like a friend of mine.	Nga mukwano gwange.
He without a child.	Ye nga talina mwana.
How he knew he didn't know.	Engeri gye yali amanyi yali tamanyi.
All or nothing, he said.	Byonna oba tewali, bwe yagambye.
He knows you’re not what he wants.	Akimanyi nti toli ky’ayagala.
This plan was dangerous.	Enteekateeka eno yali ya bulabe.
That’s really what it had.	Ekyo ddala kye kyalina.
He didn’t want to come here.	Yali tayagala kujja wano.
That’s how he did it.	Bwatyo bwe yakikola.
That’s really nice to see.	Ekyo ddala kirungi okulaba.
No problem, really.	Tewali buzibu, ddala.
This, in my opinion, is not true.	Kino, mu ndowooza yange, si kituufu.
I’m not the only one who thinks that.	Si nze nzekka alowooza ekyo.
You are a beautiful girlfriend.	Oli muganzi mulungi.
That would be a problem.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
I want to go.	Njagala kugenda.
I know you won’t.	Nkimanyi nti tojja.
They were everywhere.	Baali buli wamu.
He could hardly speak.	Yali tasobola bulungi kwogera.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
What a beautiful sight!	Nga kirungi nnyo!
Everything now.	Buli kimu kati.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
That's the whole thing.	Ekyo kye kintu kyonna.
I have a lot of things.	Nnina ebintu bingi.
I really want to go.	Njagala nnyo okugenda.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
He'll be fine now.	Ajja kuba bulungi kati.
I didn’t know if you would come.	Nali simanyi oba ojja kujja.
And we have work to do.	Era tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
No one was particularly interested.	Tewali yali ayagala nnyo.
I’m just a man.	Nze ndi musajja yekka.
He has a lot of money	Alina ssente nnyingi
It’s hard to do everything.	Kizibu okukola buli kimu.
That's the reason why.	Eyo y'ensonga lwaki.
This is very unusual.	Kino si kya bulijjo nnyo.
However, he knew what he was going to say.	Kyokka yali amanyi kye yali agenda okwogera.
It wasn’t the case.	Si bwe kyali.
I’m the only one who can talk to him about it.	Nze nzekka asobola okwogera naye ku nsonga eno.
This would certainly be a great place.	Mazima ddala kino kyandibadde kifo kirungi nnyo.
He talked about the idea, the form, the function.	Yayogera ku ndowooza, ekifaananyi, omulimu.
We don’t have much time.	Tetulina budde bungi.
He can say whatever he wants.	Asobola okwogera kyonna ky’ayagala.
And they probably are.	Era oboolyawo bwe bali.
Of course, that was not the case.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo si bwe kyali.
This was not what he thought he wanted.	Kino si kye yali alowooza nti yali ayagala.
He's pretty sick, he is.	Mulwadde bulungi, ali.
But maybe it was.	Naye mpozzi bwe kyali.
Help! 	Okuyamba!
help! 	okuyamba!
He can’t eat properly.	Tasobola kulya bulungi.
Anyone who wants to.	Omuntu yenna ayagala.
I know that of course.	Nkimanyi nti ddala.
In fact, she looks good on everything.	Mu butuufu, alabika bulungi ku buli kimu.
Right now, it’s very important.	Mu kiseera kino, kikulu nnyo.
It’s not just me.	Si nze kyokka.
He is the best in this town.	Ye asinga mu kibuga kino.
Without any planning.	Nga tewali nteekateeka yonna.
When we need it.	Bwe twetaaga.
Certainly something had.	Mazima ddala ekintu kyalina.
He owned the house.	Yalina ennyumba eyo.
But you have it.	Naye ggwe olina.
Obviously it wasn’t.	Kya lwatu si bwe kyali.
I really don't care though.	Mazima ddala sifaayo wadde.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
That’s certainly not my opinion.	Ekyo mazima ddala si kye ndowooza yange.
He was my friend.	Yali mukwano gwange.
I'll come with you, she said.	Nja kujja naawe, bwe yagamba.
Apparently he can’t drive.	Kirabika tasobola kuvuga.
He needed to be alone, he needed time to think.	Yali yeetaaga okuba yekka, yali yeetaaga obudde okulowooza.
No one is coming.	Tewali ajja.
I like being on my own.	Njagala nnyo okubeera ku nze.
Nothing could be more obvious.	Tewali kyali kiyinza kuba kya lwatu okusinga ekyo.
Everyone has their own opinion.	Buli muntu alina endowooza ye.
Obviously, something is going on.	Kya lwatu nti waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
But that’s a dog.	Naye eyo embwa.
There is nothing like this.	Tewali kintu nga kino.
This is going to work.	Kino kigenda kukola.
Not to me.	Si gyendi.
No, not necessarily, no.	Nedda, si kituufu nti, nedda.
Do you want to go to the city?	Oyagala kugenda mu kibuga?
Indeed, it was.	Mazima ddala, bwe kyali.
He didn't know what it was.	Yali tamanyi kiki.
That one is there.	Oyo ali eyo.
I am the only one here.	Nze nze nzekka wano.
I was pretty sure everyone knew.	Nali nkakasa bulungi nti buli omu akimanyi.
But it is a beautiful thing.	Naye kintu kirungi nnyo.
He had nothing.	Yali talina ky’alina.
Not that it matters now.	Si nti kikulu kati.
But he is in a good place.	Naye ali mu kifo kirungi.
Not necessarily in one place.	Si kituufu nti mu kifo kimu.
He felt like he really couldn’t go.	Yawulira nga ddala tasobola kugenda.
He was really nice, she said.	Yali mulungi ddala, bwe yagambye.
You will be here with us.	Ojja kuba wano naffe.
I’m not as good at that.	Ekyo siri mulungi nga bwe kiri.
I want to know.	Njagala okumanya.
At home, at school.	Awaka, ku ssomero.
I won’t be there.	Sijja kubeerawo.
I don’t want to be there.	Saagala kubeerawo.
Maybe you love the past.	Mpozzi nga oyagala nnyo emabega.
Everyone is safe.	Buli muntu talina bulabe.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
I know nothing about it.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
He thought it was good.	Yalowooza nti kyali kirungi.
There was nothing he could do now.	Tewali kye yali asobola kukola kati.
You are the best.	Ggwe asinga obulungi.
In fact, he always had.	Mu butuufu, bulijjo yalina.
He works hard and doesn’t have time for this.	Akola nnyo era kino talina budde.
I’m the best.	Nze asinga.
You have to do this every day.	Kino olina okukikola buli lunaku.
That’s easy.	Kye ekyo kyangu.
I thought it was something like that.	Nalowooza nti kyali kintu ng’ekyo.
That picture was beautiful.	Ekifaananyi ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
Not in my case, though.	Kyokka si mu mbeera yange.
No one really knows what to do.	Mu butuufu tewali amanyi kya kukola.
He is with her.	Ali naye.
He really had to go.	Ddala yalina okugenda.
And he probably did.	Era oboolyawo yakikola.
But it’s not this.	Naye si kino.
He was a pleasure to work with.	Yali musanyufu nnyo okukola naye.
He was a good kid.	Yali mwana mulungi.
And you have to be that.	Era olina okuba ekyo.
I will do it for you.	Nja kukikola ku ggwe.
But it is very important.	Naye kikulu nnyo.
In a sense, of course, that is true.	Mu ngeri emu, kya lwatu nti ekyo kituufu.
I was too scared to do anything.	Nnali ntya nnyo nga sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
The food is ready.	Emmere ewedde.
I love being home.	Njagala nnyo okubeera awaka.
The thing is fine as well.	Ekintu kiri bulungi nga bwe kiri.
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
Probably not very well.	Oboolyawo si bulungi nnyo.
I am working on the same thing right now.	Nze nkola ku kintu kye kimu mu kiseera kino.
He was good now.	Yali mulungi kati.
It’s hard to know.	Kizibu okumanya.
And they really are.	Era ddala bwe bali.
Or whatever you want.	Oba ky’oyagala.
No, it’s not you.	Nedda, si ggwe.
But it’s going on.	Naye kigenda mu maaso.
We are going to work hard to make this happen.	Tugenda kukola nnyo okulaba nga kino kituufu.
And you .	Naawe .
Who does the talking?	Ani akola okwogera?
Everything is fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi.
He is not ordinary.	Si wa bulijjo.
I’m okay to be .	Nze ndi bulungi okubeera .
It can work.	Kiyinza okukola.
At home.	Awaka.
This is none of my business.	Eno si nsonga yange yonna.
It wasn’t what he wanted to be.	Si kye yali ayagala kubeera.
I know what he would do.	Nkimanyi kye yandikoze.
That would be a great thing.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu kikulu nnyo.
I couldn’t believe it.	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti kyali kituufu.
I want to talk about you.	Njagala kwogera ku ggwe.
If only it were normal.	Singa kyali kya bulijjo.
There is no problem here either.	Wano era tewali buzibu bwonna.
Where have you been? 	Obadde wa?
He was in trouble.	Yali mu buzibu.
It's a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi.
No, it wasn’t him.	Nedda, si ye yali oyo.
I guess it’s not.	Ntebereza nti si bwe kiri.
Not in any way, not at any time.	Si mu ngeri yonna, si mu kiseera kyonna.
He will be here this afternoon for dinner.	Agenda kubeera wano akawungeezi ka leero okulya ekyeggulo.
It was his friend, obviously.	Yali mukwano gwe, nga kirabika.
Maybe this will help.	Mpozzi kino kijja kuyamba.
Not very much at all.	Si nnyo nnyo.
I’m going to spend a little time with him.	Ngenda kumala naye akaseera katono.
How beautiful she was.	Nga yali mulungi nnyo.
Not all of it, probably.	Si byonna, oboolyawo.
We’ll see about that.	Tujja kulaba ku nsonga eyo.
Whatever he did was right.	Kyonna kye yakola kyali kituufu.
I knew that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi.
I don’t know which which which.	Simanyi ki ki ki.
And as it is.	Era nga bwe kiri.
This does not seem to be the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
We will come back to this point again.	Tujja kuddamu kudda ku nsonga eno.
But he can’t do it.	Naye tasobola kukikola.
I don't know.	Simanyi.
He has a plan.	Alina enteekateeka.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
This is a complex problem.	Kino kizibu kizibu nnyo.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera.
He had work in the morning.	Yalina omulimu ku makya.
And that may be true.	Era ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
He left that night.	Yagenda ekiro ekyo.
It’s up to you.	Kiri gy’oli.
You’re too good of a guy not to.	Oli mulungi nnyo wa ggaayi obutakola.
In.	Mu.
That’s a great idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
Perhaps that’s why he felt so unhappy.	Oboolyawo y’ensonga lwaki yawulira nga si musanyufu nnyo.
He knew he shouldn't do that.	Yali akimanyi nti ekyo talina kukikola.
He didn’t do anything.	Tewali kye yakola.
He would have been like that.	Yandibadde bw’atyo.
I know exactly what he was talking about.	Nze kye yali ayogera nkimanyi bulungi.
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okukikola.
But there is no reason for this.	Naye tewali nsonga yonna eri ensonga eno.
It is, it is.	Kiri, kye kiri.
I wonder which of us.	Nze nneebuuza ani ku ffe.
They are really powerful.	Ddala ba maanyi.
That’s up to you.	Ekyo kiri gyoli.
I know nothing about it.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
To me, this was always a problem.	Eri nze, kino bulijjo kyali kizibu.
My son said.	Mwana wange bwe yagamba.
Same as before.	Kye kimu nga bwe kyali emabegako.
It’s coming soon.	Kijja mangu.
That would be terrible.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
I couldn’t do it again.	Nnali sisobola kuddamu kukikola.
Exactly what he didn’t want.	Ddala kye yali tayagala.
One and only.	Omu era yekka.
I’m making a point.	Nze nkola ensonga.
You can’t with this.	Tosobola na kino.
Where did he go.	Yagenda wa.
No one was talking.	Tewali yali ayogera.
It is very easy to see the car.	Kyangu nnyo okulaba mmotoka.
I wasn’t ready to go.	Nnali siri mwetegefu kugenda.
It was mine.	Yali wange.
Maybe this was it.	Mpozzi kino kye kyali.
That would be terrible.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
There is no man.	Tewali musajja yenna.
I just have to know what it is.	Nnina okumanya kye kiri kyokka.
It’s pretty easy to see why.	Kyangu nnyo okulaba lwaki.
And then he is.	Era awo ye.
None of this was.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kyali.
It seems pretty obvious to me.	Kirabika nga kirabika bulungi gyendi.
I had no plans whatsoever.	Nnali sirina nteekateeka yonna.
He hoped the speech would be short.	Yalina essuubi nti okwogera kujja kuba kumpi.
He's in the car.	Ye mu mmotoka.
I think that’s a bit lucky.	Ndowooza ekyo kya mukisa katono.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
He is a doctor.	Ye musawo.
And now he has.	Era kati alina.
I really had no idea what it could be.	Mazima ddala nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki kye kiyinza okuba.
You can do it now.	Osobola okukikola kati.
But we cannot have that attitude.	Naye tetusobola kuba na ndowooza eyo.
I want it now.	Njagala kati.
I know you want to make a point.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala kukola nsonga.
And yes, it was.	Era ye, bwe kyali.
We could talk about anything together.	Twali tusobola okwogera ffenna ku kintu kyonna.
How hard it really is to say this to someone else.	Nga kizibu ddala okwogera kino eri omuntu omulala.
Everything is bad.	Buli kimu kibi.
I belonged to the other guy.	Nze nali wa ggaayi omulala.
And, yes, it is a real day.	Era, ye, gwe lunaku lwa ddala.
You have to see that.	Olina okulaba ekyo.
He did nothing of the kind.	Tewali kintu kyonna kye yakola mu ngeri eyo.
It was a very powerful moment.	Kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
I know that’s not good.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo si kirungi.
Anyway.	Engeri yonna.
Definitely not where I thought they were.	Mazima ddala si we nnalowooza nti bali.
I knew it was a problem.	Namanya nti yali buzibu.
He has to be what he is now.	Alina okuba ky’ali kati.
He was talking to himself.	Yali ayogera yekka.
He is the best artist.	Ye muyimbi asinga.
It's up to you right now.	Kiri gy'oli mu kiseera kino.
It’s not my problem.	Si kizibu kyange.
I will be there too.	Nja kubeerawo era.
It goes on and on.	Kigenda mu maaso ne kigenda mu maaso.
Do you have a dog?	Olina embwa?
I have to go to work.	Nnina okugenda ku mulimu.
He was always busy.	Bulijjo yali bbize.
This is not dangerous.	Kino si kya bulabe.
Let him do what he needs to do.	Akole kye yeetaaga okukola.
He had no interest in his work.	Yali talina ky’ayagala ku mulimu gwe.
It’s not necessarily true.	Si kituufu nti kituufu.
I want it all.	Njagala byonna.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Nnali mmanyi bulungi kye yali ayagala.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
He doesn’t have anything.	Talina ky’alina.
At the time, it was normal.	Mu kiseera ekyo, kyali kya bulijjo.
In fact there is.	Mu butuufu waliwo.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
I hope you do the same!.	Nsuubira naawe okola kye kimu!.
That’s what he really wanted to do.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala ennyo okukola.
Good man, she thought.	Musajja mulungi, bwe yalowooza.
He didn’t know that.	Yali tamanyi ekyo.
I was in the room.	Nnali mu kisenge.
He doesn't know what's going on.	Tamanyi kigenda mu maaso.
I love working in there.	Njagala nnyo okukola mu eyo.
Maybe that’s a good thing.	Mpozzi ekyo kintu kirungi.
But no one could do it.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna yali asobola kukola.
It was like.	Yali nga.
In practice, maybe.	Mu nkola, mpozzi.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera.
It's the office for a while.	Ye ofiisi okumala akaseera.
You don’t have to tell anyone.	Tolina kubuulira muntu yenna.
But you know how it is.	Naye omanyi bwe kiri.
I'm not quite sure how to do that though.	Sikakasa bulungi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukola ekyo wadde.
He says he is progressing well.	Agamba nti agenda mu maaso bulungi.
But we’ll see what happens.	Naye tujja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
Or so everyone said.	Oba buli omu bwe yagamba.
Not bad so far.	Si kibi okutuusa kati.
In reality, however, that is not true.	Kyokka mu butuufu, ekyo si kituufu.
And there are a lot of things about that.	Era waliwo ebintu bingi ku ekyo.
He is stronger than ever.	Alina amaanyi okusinga bwe yali abadde.
I could come back maybe tonight.	Nnali nsobola okudda mpozzi ekiro kino.
Nothing about being human.	Tewali kintu kyonna ku kubeera muntu.
Everything was normal.	Buli kimu kyali kya bulijjo.
It may be that there is.	Kiyinza okuba nga waliwo...
This is not the issue now.	Eno si y’ensonga kati.
This was absolutely true for me.	Kino kyali kituufu ddala gyendi.
I couldn’t, not the way he could.	Nnali sisobola, si ngeri gye yali asobola.
Together, they were powerful.	Nga bali wamu, baali ba maanyi nnyo.
I wish he was still here.	Njagala yandibadde akyali wano.
I need his help.	Nneetaaga obuyambi bwe.
We have to act now.	Tulina okukola kati.
You don’t have to eat too much.	Tolina kulya nnyo.
He had a phone.	Yalina essimu.
Are you ready for the wedding?	Oli mwetegefu okugenda ku mbaga?
No one is in the classroom.	Tewali ali mu kibiina.
It wasn’t the case.	Si bwe kyali.
At home that’s easy.	Awaka ekyo kyangu.
I think it will work well.	Ndowooza kijja kukola bulungi.
He is better at it than I am.	Ye asinga okukikola okusinga nze.
And yes you can.	Era ye osobola.
This is not a simple quantity.	Kino si bungi bwangu.
I love doing that.	Njagala nnyo okukola ekyo.
He was a human being.	Yali muntu.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
And he couldn’t believe it, but he was coming.	Era yali tasobola kukkiriza, naye yali ajja.
He heard nothing.	Tewali kye yawulira.
Indeed.	Ddala ddala.
During this time, you will work every day.	Mu kiseera kino, ojja kukola buli lunaku.
But on !!!.	Naye ku !!!.
He may have had it.	Ayinza okuba nga yalina.
He was behind her now.	Yali emabega we kati.
But in this case, it’s not.	Naye mu mbeera eno, si bwe kiri.
He couldn't believe he said that.	Yali tayinza kukkiriza nti ekyo yayogera.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
I love that one too.	Oyo nange njagala nnyo.
Nothing important will happen.	Tewali kintu kikulu kijja kubaawo.
He had been here before.	Yali abadde wano emabegako.
In any case.	Mu mbeera yonna.
No one knows.	Tewali amanyi.
It was fast and should have been fast.	Yali ya mangu era yandibadde ya mangu.
But he couldn't, he knew that.	Naye yali tasobola, ekyo yali akimanyi.
But it seems like you’re a good person too.	Naye kirabika naawe oli muntu mulungi.
It’s just true.	Kituufu kyokka.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
He couldn’t let that happen.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
Driving to town was a hassle.	Okuvuga mmotoka okugenda mu kibuga kyali kizibu nnyo.
I’m going in the morning.	Nze ngenda ku makya.
I’m not a man either.	Nze nange si musajja.
I'm young	Ndi muto
He would have been with her.	Yandibadde naye.
I have a reason.	Nnina ensonga.
You go with him.	Ggwe ogenda naye.
That is true right now.	Ekyo kituufu mu kiseera kino.
I know the guy, actually.	Nze mmanyi ggaayi, mu butuufu.
I don’t want you.	Saagala ggwe.
We can’t live together.	Tetusobola kubeera wamu.
This is exactly the same thing.	Kino kye kintu kye kimu ddala.
You are the one.	Ggwe oli omu.
It is dangerous to swim.	Kya bulabe okuwuga.
You’ll probably be fine.	Oboolyawo ojja kuba bulungi.
Only one has been coming.	Omu yekka abadde ajja.
It doesn’t matter who.	Si nsonga ani.
Everyone is happy, very happy.	Buli omu musanyufu, musanyufu nnyo.
He wanted to know why.	Yali ayagala okumanya ensonga lwaki.
It was an intense process.	Yali nkola ya maanyi nnyo.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
Everyone knows now.	Buli omu amanyi kati.
But no one really wants that.	Naye ekyo tewali ayagala ddala.
You don’t have an answer for that.	Ekyo tolina kya kuddamu.
Where do you want to go?	Oyagala kugenda wa?
No power no nothing.	Tewali maanyi tewali kintu kyonna.
It’s easy to do.	Kyangu okukola.
He was a doctor.	Yali musawo.
You certainly know.	Mazima ddala omanyi.
I’m sure you can do it.	Nkakasa nti osobola okukikola.
How can I do that.	Ekyo nnyinza ntya okukikola.
This was for the beautiful me.	Kino kyali kya nze omulungi.
He's done it before.	Abadde akikola emabegako.
I was definitely a happy kid.	Mazima ddala nnali mwana musanyufu.
He hadn’t waited long.	Yali tannaba kulinda bbanga ddene.
Call the police.	Kuba poliisi essimu.
It was fine, though.	Kyali kirungi, wadde.
I'll be close.	Nja kuba kumpi.
He is my son.	Ye mwana wange.
Work rather well.	Omulimu okusinga obulungi.
I thought we had.	Nalowooza nti twali tulina.
Call the police.	Kuba poliisi essimu.
It doesn’t matter, baby.	Si kikulu mwana wange.
No, not really.	Nedda, si ddala.
Less.	Katono.
That’s not always true.	Ekyo si kituufu bulijjo.
He said he didn't want to go back.	Yagambye nti tayagala kudda.
No one lived there.	Tewali yali abeera eyo.
I am sure it is.	Nkakasa nti bwe kiri.
I think it’s very important.	Ndowooza nti kikulu nnyo.
I'm not so sure that's true.	Sikakasa nnyo nti ekyo kituufu.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
We have nowhere to go.	Tetulina we tugenda.
There really isn’t a very good job.	Mu butuufu tewali mulimu mulungi nnyo.
Why, he didn't know.	Lwaki, yali tamanyi.
But he tried.	Naye yagezaako.
But he is very happy.	Naye musanyufu nnyo.
We need your opinion.	Twetaaga endowooza yo.
She was beautiful as always.	Yali mulungi nga bulijjo.
And we will do it.	Era tujja kukikola.
See.	Okulaba.
But he’s nowhere to be found.	Naye talina w’ali.
This was common at the time.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo mu kiseera ekyo.
I can’t talk to him.	Sisobola kwogera naye.
I can’t wait to see that.	Siyinza kulinda kulaba ekyo.
Am I the one? 	Nze nze?
But it’s not just this.	Naye si kino kyokka.
However, I couldn’t do that.	Kyokka ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola.
He's not a man.	Si musajja.
Now there is no time.	Kati tewali budde.
That’s what he was blessed with.	Ekyo kye yafuna omukisa.
He is just an ordinary man.	Ye musajja wa bulijjo yekka.
Maybe he would.	Mpozzi yandikoze.
It will go away.	Kijja kugenda.
If only he could see.	Singa yali asobola okulaba kyokka.
Nobody wanted to do that.	Ekyo tewali yali ayagala kukikola.
I don’t really care about any of this.	Sifaayo nnyo ku kintu kyonna ku bino.
Everyone needs help.	Buli muntu yeetaaga obuyambi.
Not really, he said.	Si ddala, bwe yagambye.
He knew what he was doing.	Yali amanyi kye yali akola.
There is no plan.	Tewali nteekateeka yonna.
There, now you know.	Eyo, kati omanyi.
You can do so many things.	Osobola okukola ebintu bingi nnyo.
I'll be back with the police.	Nja kudda ne poliisi.
He is very happy.	Musanyufu nnyo.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
He said he didn’t have any.	Yagambye nti talina.
He’s going to be here for a long time.	Agenda kubeera wano okumala ebbanga ddene.
No one said anything nice.	Tewali muntu yenna yayogera kirungi.
He would have to do it.	Yandibadde alina okukikola.
He loves to go home.	Ayagala nnyo okudda eka.
I know, this is not nice to say.	Nkimanyi, kino si kirungi kwogera.
You can do it again.	Osobola okuddamu okukikola.
This is just one thing.	Kino kimu kyokka.
I'll see to the schedule.	Nja kulaba ku nteekateeka.
He wasn't supposed to be here.	Yali talina kubeera wano.
He had to do it.	Yali alina okukikola.
No, he won’t.	Nedda, tajja kukikola.
But he does do so.	Naye akola bw’atyo.
I think I was the only one.	Ndowooza nnali nze nzekka.
No one here beats.	Tewali muntu yenna wano akuba.
One cannot quite know.	Omuntu tasobola bulungi kumanya.
I guess this is a form of that.	Ntebereza nti eno ngeri ya ekyo.
Here is something.	Wano waliwo ekintu.
Now he	Kati ye .
This was good for them.	Kino kyali kirungi gye bali.
You’ll see, it’s going well.	Ojja kulaba, kigenda bulungi.
And he loves his job.	Era ayagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
Actually, it’s really good.	Mu butuufu, ddala kirungi.
He must have been like that.	Ateekwa okuba nga bwe yali.
He had been good at it.	Yali abadde mulungi mu nsonga eyo.
That’s a fact.	Ekyo kya mazima.
The only thing is.	Ekintu kyokka kiri nti.
Or anyone else.	Oba omuntu omulala yenna.
Not that it matters to me.	Si nti kikulu gyendi.
You can either do it or you can’t.	Osobola okukikola oba tosobola.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
That is a powerful thing.	Ekyo kintu kya maanyi.
I am not good at this.	Siri mulungi mu kino.
It’s happening at school.	Kigenda mu maaso ku ssomero.
I hope that’s not the case.	Nsuubira nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
That person was me.	Omuntu oyo nali nze.
For the whole week.	Okumala wiiki yonna.
And so did my father.	Era ne taata bwe yakola.
We are the only ones.	Ffe ffekka.
No, it is not.	Nedda si bwe kiri.
Not very much at all.	Si nnyo nnyo.
He went to work.	Yagenda ku mulimu.
That's a thing.	Ekyo kintu.
But you can’t.	Naye tosobola.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
You work hard.	Okola nnyo.
Same thing with me.	Ekintu kye kimu ne nange.
This is my room.	Kino kye kisenge kyange.
Same thing last weekend at home.	Ekintu kye kimu wiikendi ewedde awaka.
Where he knew he was.	Gye yali amanyi nti yali.
Maybe in the last hour.	Mpozzi mu ssaawa ewedde.
But we need to do this.	Naye kino twetaaga okukikola.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
Such a thing is a terrible idea.	Ekintu ng’ekyo kirowoozo kibi nnyo.
Or you are.	Oba ggwe oli.
Now that’s not a bad idea.	Kati ekyo si kirowoozo kibi.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
I am fine myself.	Nze kennyini ndi bulungi.
Maybe he wasn’t.	Mpozzi nga si bwe yali.
On the bottom.	Ku wansi.
We are the same.	Ffe tuli kimu.
He really is in this movie.	Ddala ali mu firimu eno.
To strike, to strike.	Okukuba, okukuba.
I'm pretty sure it was him.	Nkakasa bulungi nti ye yali.
You have to think hard.	Olina okulowooza ennyo.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
Actually, not all of it.	Mu butuufu, si yonna.
The point was to win.	Ensonga yali ya kuwangula.
Just one night.	Ekiro kimu kyokka.
I just hope he might make a lot of money soon.	Nsuubira kyokka nti ayinza okukola ssente nnyingi mu bbanga ttono.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
Like, really early.	Nga, ddala nga bukyali.
I didn’t know where he was.	Nali simanyi gye yali.
But it wasn’t like that at all.	Naye si bwe kyali n’akatono.
He is very strong.	Ali wa maanyi nnyo.
But that would probably be worse.	Naye oboolyawo ekyo kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
That’s just not realistic.	Ekyo kyokka si kya ddala.
He may have been.	Ayinza okuba nga yali.
We need it.	Twetaaga.
In...	Mu...
No one is willing to talk.	Tewali muntu yenna mwetegefu kwogera.
The picture was bad.	Ekifaananyi kyali kibi.
I’m doing my job.	Nze nkola omulimu gwange.
He said you were in trouble.	Yagambye nti oli mu buzibu.
However, it may be.	Kyokka, kiyinza okuba nga.
I think yes, a little bit.	Ndowooza ye, katono.
That’s really good, of course.	Ekyo ddala kirungi, ddala.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
Who was he.	Ani gwe yali.
He didn't have to know the answer.	Yali talina kumanya kya kuddamu.
It would be difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu.
Where did he go?	Yagenda wa?
Good at what he did too.	Mulungi mu bye yakola naye.
Maybe you can talk to him.	Mpozzi osobola okwogera naye.
Of course he was.	Kya lwatu nti yali.
He loves many things.	Ayagala nnyo ebintu bingi.
He obviously knew where they were.	Kya lwatu nti yali amanyi gye baali.
It is in a bad location.	Kiri mu kifo kibi.
It’s as simple and complicated as that.	Kyangu era kizibu nga ekyo.
Can't really talk to him though.	Tasobola kwogera naye ddala wadde.
At the time, he could not eat properly.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali tasobola kulya bulungi.
When you didn’t want to be here.	Nga toyagala kubeera wano.
But that was normal.	Naye ekyo kyali kya bulijjo.
He knew what he would have to do.	Yali amanyi kye yandibadde alina okukola.
I think that’s a bad thing.	Ndowooza ekyo kintu kibi.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I'm not exactly sure.	Sikakasa bulungi ddala.
There is no space.	Tewali kifo kyonna.
Every player has one.	Buli muzannyi alina emu.
It’s the same as it is now.	Kye kimu nga bwe kiri kati.
It’s just the same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu kyokka.
You have to live in the moment.	Olina okubeera mu kiseera kino.
Actually, this is not the case.	Mu butuufu, kino si bwe kiri.
Indeed, for a little while.	Mazima ddala, okumala akaseera katono.
However, the food was plain.	Kyokka emmere yali ya bulijjo.
I don’t know if he was or not.	Simanyi oba yali oba nedda.
That was good and bad.	Ekyo kyali kirungi era kibi.
I had no plans whatsoever.	Nnali sirina nteekateeka yonna.
You don’t know how much.	Tomanyi ssente mmeka.
There is a problem.	Waliwo ekizibu.
The same is true of us.	Kino kye kimu ne ku ffe.
But no, not before.	Naye nedda, si emabegako.
Like, he couldn’t believe it.	Nga, yali tasobola kukkiriza.
But now it was bad.	Naye kati kyali kibi.
I am definitely going to try this.	Mazima ddala ngenda kugezaako kino.
We needed to get as much as we could do.	Twali twetaaga okufuna bingi nga bwe twali tusobola okukola.
I don’t want to go.	Saagala kugenda.
He's not the only one with issues.	Si ye yekka alina ensonga.
He loves it so much.	Ayagala nnyo.
That is the real problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu ennyo.
The same thing goes here.	Ekintu kye kimu kigenda wano.
They were like us.	Baali nga ffe.
I don’t know what that would be.	Simanyi ekyo kyandibadde ki.
He’s going to be a doctor.	Agenda kubeera musawo.
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
No one is sick of him.	Tewali mulwadde ku ye.
He knew better now.	Yali amanyi bulungi kati.
And, of course, he is still very young.	Era, ddala, akyali muto nnyo.
He prayed that it was true.	Yasaba nti kituufu.
I know that you are.	Nkimanyi nti ggwe oli.
I have a job now.	Nnina omulimu kati.
You won’t be there.	Tojja kubaawo.
But only you can do it.	Naye ggwe wekka asobola okukikola.
I am here now.	Nze ndi wano kati.
At home as well.	Awaka nga bwe kiri.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
He is a real, real guy.	Ye ddala, ggaayi ddala.
Everyone except us.	Buli muntu okuggyako ffe.
I’m here with my girlfriend.	Nze ndi wano ne muganzi wange.
That’s how he had been.	Bw’atyo bwe yali abadde.
I’m sorry to say that.	Nsonyiwa okwogera ekyo.
That was what he was thinking.	Ekyo kye yali alowooza.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
But he couldn’t do it.	Naye yali tasobola kukikola.
I was, of course.	Nze nnali, ddala.
But you just can’t.	Naye ggwe kyokka tosobola.
He needed to win this argument.	Yali yeetaaga okuwangula ensonga eno.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
Maybe he should do some reading.	Mpozzi yandikoze okusoma.
It’s not like that though.	Si bwe kiri wadde.
Saying what I want to say.	Okwogera kye njagala okwogera.
We cannot allow this to happen.	Kino tetusobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
One down, one to go.	Omu wansi, omu okugenda.
Soon he couldn’t even talk.	Mu bbanga ttono yali tasobola na kwogera.
I felt like I wanted to regain my footing.	Nnali mpulira nga njagala kuddamu kufuna kifo kye nnali nfunye.
But he couldn’t, not yet.	Naye yali tasobola, nga tannaba.
What kind of food is this?	Eno emmere ya ngeri ki?
It’s as simple as that and as complicated as that.	Kyangu nga ekyo era kizibu nga ekyo.
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
It’s not easy at all.	Si kyangu n’akatono.
That he wanted to be there again.	Nti yali ayagala kuddamu kubeerawo.
I hear you.	Mpulira.
He wasn’t like that.	Yali si bw’atyo.
He really wanted to go.	Yali ayagala nnyo okugenda.
I’m not there right now.	Siri awo mu kiseera kino.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
I love this very much.	Kino njagala nnyo.
He loved his job.	Yali ayagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
I’m pretty sure you do too.	Nkakasa bulungi nti naawe okola.
He looks good to me.	Alabika bulungi gyendi.
I won’t have to do any more trouble.	Sijja kuddamu kukola buzibu bwonna.
I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.	Simanyi kiki ekigenda okubaawo enkya.
You have to go well.	Olina okugenda obulungi.
He didn't have much time for that, though.	Yali talina nnyo budde bwa ekyo, wadde.
That was probably my problem.	Oboolyawo kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
He told me he wouldn’t be home for a while.	Yang’amba nti tajja kubeera waka okumala akaseera.
Perhaps he had.	Oboolyawo yalina.
However, it is not uncommon.	Kyokka, si kya bulijjo.
That seems pretty complicated.	Ekyo kirabika nga kizibu nnyo.
No one wanted to know anything.	Tewali yali ayagala kumanya kintu kyonna.
And it’s not just that.	Era si ekyo kyokka.
That can be a challenge.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
I know more than you do.	Nze mmanyi bingi okusinga ggwe.
He needed to be like that.	Yali yeetaaga okuba bw’atyo.
He thought he was ready.	Yalowooza nti yali mwetegefu.
I don’t think it’s good.	Sirowooza nti kirungi.
But he couldn’t have his way.	Naye yali tasobola kuba na ngeri ye.
Everyone was thinking the same thing.	Buli omu yali alowooza ekintu kye kimu.
I think he's really pretty.	Ndowooza ddala mulungi nnyo.
I didn’t know it was coming.	Nze nali simanyi nti kijja.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
Everyone is.	Buli muntu ye.
He tried to speak again too soon.	Yagezaako okuddamu okwogera amangu ennyo.
He must be like.	Alina okuba nga.
Now you can.	Kati osobola.
It wasn’t the issue.	Si ye yali ensonga.
Basically.	Mu bwangu.
We leave as soon as we can.	Tugenda amangu ddala nga bwe tusobola.
And you move on.	Era ggwe ogenda mu maaso.
He doesn’t have to say too much.	Talina kwogera bingi nnyo.
Why would you be.	Lwaki wandibadde.
I am so glad we are.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nga bwe tuli.
No one knows.	Tewali amanyi.
Everything is not as it seems.	Buli kimu si nga bwe kirabika.
This is not difficult to do.	Kino si kizibu kukikola.
Indeed, there is.	Ddala, waliwo.
He was just a really nice guy.	Yali ggaayi mulungi ddala yekka.
He was a teacher.	Yali musomesa.
But don’t go to any trouble.	Naye togenda mu buzibu bwonna.
A friendly dog?	Embwa ya mukwano?
It’s the eyes.	Ye maaso.
He went to work.	Yagenda ku mulimu.
And there’s a dog.	Era waliwo embwa.
I think you’ll make a good father.	Ndowooza ojja kukola taata omulungi.
He should have known that.	Ekyo yandibadde akimanyi.
I probably should work.	Oboolyawo nsaanidde okukola.
It’s real to me.	Kya ddala gyendi.
I love doing that.	Njagala nnyo okukola ekyo.
We were very low.	Twali nnyo wansi.
We were husband and wife.	Twali musajja na mukyala.
Here are some ways.	Wano waliwo engeri.
I won’t stay long, a week at the most.	Sijja kumala bbanga ddene, wiiki emu okusinga.
Or it’s not me.	Oba si nze.
He was the most outspoken person in his class.	Ye yali omuntu asinga okwogera mu kibiina kye.
But for now.	Naye ku lwa kati.
We have everything.	Tulina buli kimu.
He’s not that good.	Si mulungi nnyo bw’atyo.
He spoke quickly.	Yayogera mu bwangu.
And you know this.	Era kino okimanyi.
Now, everyone knows it.	Kati, buli omu akimanyi.
That’s what he agreed to.	Ekyo kye yakkiriza.
I didn’t know how.	Nnali simanyi ngeri ki.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ekyo tewali kibi kyonna.
From behind me.	Okuva emabega wange.
And indeed it was.	Era ddala bwe kyali.
And now it’s not even talking.	Era kati si wadde kwogera.
I want to play again.	Njagala kuddamu kuzannya.
Only one person did this.	Kino omuntu omu yekka ye yakikola.
He wasn’t friendly to me.	Yali si wa mukwano gyendi.
He should definitely do that.	Ekyo yandibadde akikola ddala.
He wants to do it again, he wants another chance.	Ayagala kuddamu kukikola, ayagala omukisa omulala.
It doesn’t matter what he wants.	Si kikulu ky’ayagala.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
It’s a problem.	Kye kizibu.
No one thought this would happen.	Tewali yali alowooza nti kino kijja kubaawo.
And you have to do it.	Era olina okukikola.
Certainly not.	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
Not to everyone.	Nedda eri buli omu.
He was good to me.	Yali mulungi gyendi.
We have no choice but to go with him.	Tetulina kya kukola okuggyako okugenda naye.
And then he could.	Era awo yali asobola.
You are not one of us.	Ggwe toli omu ku ffe.
We’ll go back to no.	Tujja kudda ku nedda.
Why, why, why.	Lwaki, lwaki, lwaki.
You have to be the one who makes things happen.	Ggwe olina okuba ggwe akola ebintu okubaawo.
He’s always been like that.	Bulijjo abadde bw’atyo.
This will not be a problem for me.	Kino tekijja kuba kizibu gyendi.
But there is a problem.	Naye waliwo obuzibu.
She is always so happy and energetic.	Bulijjo musanyufu nnyo era alina amaanyi.
He was willing.	Yali ayagala.
I do.	Nkola.
We both needed it.	Ffembi twali twetaaga.
Nothing he did seemed right.	Tewali kye yakola kyali kirabika nga kituufu.
This is a very important thing.	Kino kintu kikulu nnyo.
That’s not what it is for me.	Ekyo si kye kiri gyendi.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
I was there too.	Nange nnali awo.
No, not yet.	Nedda, si n’okutuusa kati.
He wanted to be there.	Yali ayagala kubeera eyo.
We definitely need to work harder.	Mazima ddala twetaaga okukola ennyo.
Apparently not much.	Kirabika si nnyo.
I wonder about that .	Ekyo nneebuuza .
Everyone is happy.	Buli omu musanyufu.
Mostly at the moment.	Okusinga mu kiseera kino.
He wanted his wife.	Yali ayagala mukyala we.
You have to go to work.	Olina okugenda ku mulimu.
It was where he was.	Yali gye yali wa.
That’s what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu mu butuufu.
Probably even in the house.	Oboolyawo ne mu nnyumba.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Nsuubira buli omu akola bulungi.
Me too.	Nange.
And he was.	Era yali.
He lived in the.	Yali abeera mu.
Or, in this case, you to me.	Oba, mu mbeera eno, ggwe gyendi.
Now everyone has one.	Kati buli muntu alina emu.
You’re going to be a father.	Ogenda kubeera taata.
Here we will try to make a case for both.	Wano tujja kugezaako okukola ensonga ku bombi.
He is too sick to stay at home now.	Mulwadde nnyo kati tasobola kubeera waka.
He really was a nice man, she thought.	Ddala yali musajja mulungi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
I hope he is done now.	Nsuubira nti kati amaze.
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
However, maybe that would be fine.	Kyokka, mpozzi ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
He was a very powerful musician.	Yali muyimbi wa maanyi nnyo.
Really, that’s pretty cool.	Ddala, ekyo kirungi nnyo.
And here too.	Era ne wano.
That’s so true.	Ekyo nga kituufu nnyo.
Or seeing someone else entirely.	Oba okulaba omuntu omulala ddala.
I think it won’t come.	Ndowooza tekijja kujja.
In one case.	Mu mbeera emu.
I hope the same.	Nsuubira kye kimu.
I need to get back to work.	Nze nneetaaga okudda ku mulimu.
He was well aware of that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi bulungi.
I could have helped.	Nnali nsobola okuyamba.
This seems to be true.	Kino kirabika kituufu.
And perhaps this is why it is so difficult.	Era oboolyawo eno y’ensonga lwaki kizibu nnyo.
We’re going to be fine.	Tugenda kuba bulungi.
Why, you are a good person at home too.	Lwaki, naawe awaka oli muntu mulungi.
He has been very good.	Abadde mulungi nnyo.
But he isn't.	Naye si bw'atyo.
He said he had no idea.	Yagambye nti talina kirowoozo kyonna.
But he didn’t think so.	Naye yali talowooza bw’atyo.
That’s the truth, like it or not.	Ekyo kye kituufu, oyagala oba toyagala.
I couldn’t say what exactly.	Nnali siyinza kwogera ki ddala.
As you were.	Nga bwe wali.
I wanted a wife.	Nnali njagala mukyala.
I don’t like it.	Sikyagala.
Good job we're here.	Omulimu mulungi tuli wano.
I am well and happy.	Ndi bulungi era ndi musanyufu.
But there is no one here.	Naye wano tewali muntu yenna.
That was true in a sense.	Ekyo kyali kituufu mu ngeri emu.
I’m not going to do this with you.	Kino sigenda kukikola naawe.
Someone can help.	Waliwo asobola okuyamba.
It was worse than he expected.	Kyali kibi nnyo okusinga bwe yali asuubira.
He is all of us right now.	Ye ffenna mu kiseera kino.
He could do that.	Ekyo yali asobola okukikola.
We’re not going anywhere very soon.	Tetulina gye tugenda mangu nnyo.
It was a momentous occasion.	Kyali kiseera kikulu nnyo.
I didn’t think it was true.	Nnali sirowooza nti kituufu.
It was actually quite good.	Mu butuufu kyali kirungi nnyo.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
He knew it.	Yali akimanyi.
I'll answer again.	Nja kuddamu okuddamu.
Don’t you know? 	Tomanyi?
Whether it was, no one told me.	Oba bwe kyali, tewali yang’amba.
I want to reach out to everyone.	Njagala okutuuka ku buli muntu.
He expects a lot from me.	Asuubira bingi okuva gyendi.
No time to do anything about it.	Tewali budde bwa kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
Telling someone that they are okay.	Okugamba omuntu nti ali bulungi.
That doesn’t matter now.	Ekyo si kikulu kati.
That’s not an answer.	Ekyo si kya kuddamu.
I feel it now.	Mpulira kati.
But maybe he isn’t.	Naye mpozzi si bw’atyo.
We are a group of friends.	Tuli kibiina kya mikwano.
I can’t even speak.	Sisobola na kwogera.
From there.	Okuva awo.
It looks really complicated.	Kirabika ddala kizibu.
You are a lucky man.	Oli musajja wa mukisa.
I'm thinking of answering tonight.	Nze ndowooza okuddamu ekiro kino.
I could hardly answer.	Nnali sisobola bulungi okuddamu.
He had no idea what he was doing.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki kye yali akola.
It won’t last long now.	Tekijja kumala bbanga ddene kati.
And maybe he would like that.	Era mpozzi ekyo yandiyagadde.
He is just himself.	Ye yekka ye kennyini.
Although it is not.	Wadde nga si bwe kiri.
That's what.	Ekyo kye ki...
I’m in a long time.	Nze ndi mu bbanga ddene.
But he is a very strong man.	Naye musajja wa maanyi nnyo.
It’s very hard for me to do.	Kizibu nnyo gyendi okukikola.
Probably a little early.	Oboolyawo nga bukyali katono.
I could do this.	Kino nnali nsobola okukikola.
But he asked anyway.	Naye yabuuza mu ngeri yonna.
So far, no response.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali kuddamu.
Another one tomorrow.	Omulala enkya.
I think everyone is just good.	Ndowooza buli muntu mulungi yekka.
I know what you were thinking.	Nze mmanyi kye wali olowooza.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
That’s not very good.	Ekyo si kirungi nnyo.
. . . .	.
Everything was in place.	Buli kimu kyali mu kifo.
I hope he comes soon.	Nsuubira nti ajja kujja mangu.
Maybe he had too.	Mpozzi naye yalina.
I’m human, and we need things.	Ndi muntu, era twetaaga ebintu.
No problems so far.	Tewali buzibu okutuusa kati.
He really got lucky!.	Ddala yafuna omukisa!.
We have to get to the hospital.	Tulina okutuuka mu ddwaaliro.
A real home away from home.	Awaka ddala okuva awaka.
And for how long.	Era okumala ebbanga ki.
And yes, the guy is me.	Era ye, ggaayi nze.
He was just happy.	Yali musanyufu kyokka.
I’m sure that won’t be a problem.	Nkakasa nti ekyo tekijja kuba kizibu.
He had a plan.	Yalina enteekateeka.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
He went to school and class.	Yagenda ku ssomero ne mu kibiina.
He was like that.	Yali bw’atyo.
Night is coming, now.	Ekiro kijja, kati.
He may have said or done anything.	Ayinza okuba nga yayogera oba okukola ekintu kyonna.
In the work the issue.	Mu mulimu ensonga.
And that’s certainly a good thing.	Era mazima ekyo kintu kirungi.
It can take many forms.	Kiyinza okubeera mu ngeri nnyingi.
He was on the floor.	Yali wansi.
And every day.	Era buli lunaku.
This is a very common situation.	Eno mbeera ya bulijjo nnyo.
Someone is behind me.	Waliwo omuntu ali emabega wange.
That will never happen again.	Ekyo tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
But, in a way, that wasn’t the point.	Naye, mu ngeri emu, eyo si ye yali ensonga.
We have to get to the point.	Tulina okutuuka ku nsonga.
Of course he was.	Kya lwatu nti yali.
I need to know what’s going on here.	Nnina okumanya ekigenda mu maaso wano.
I was that guy.	Nze nali ggaayi oyo.
I wanted to.	Nnali njagala.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
You have to come back with us.	Olina okudda naffe.
He was ready there.	Yali mwetegefu eyo.
But it would be wrong.	Naye kyandibadde kibi.
Dad or me.	Taata oba nze.
I really don’t want to do anything but this.	Mazima ddala saagala kukola kintu kyonna okuggyako kino.
You can make a phone call.	Osobola okukuba essimu.
In any case.	Mu ngeri yonna.
I don’t know what they were.	Simanyi kye baali.
Everyone would be happy.	Buli omu yandibadde musanyufu.
I am above all else.	Nze okusinga byonna.
It is very easy to do this in.	Kyangu nnyo okukola kino mu.
He knew who he was and why he came.	Yali amanyi ani era lwaki yajja.
But if it were true.	Naye singa kyali kituufu.
He had trouble finding a job.	Yafuna obuzibu okufuna omulimu.
He has something he really wants.	Alina ky’ayagala ennyo.
He would have loved this.	Kino yandibadde ayagala nnyo.
Not if he was going to get something.	Si singa yali agenda kufuna ekintu.
He works hard here.	Akola nnyo wano.
And it isn’t.	Era si bwe kiri.
Or, you know.	Oba, omanyi.
He knows now what’s going to happen, and he knows he wants to.	Amanyi kati ekigenda okubaawo, era akimanyi nti ayagala.
You won’t have time.	Tojja kufuna budde.
He doesn’t know about it, yet.	Tamanyi ku nsonga eyo, n’okutuusa kati.
I know what’s going to happen there.	Nze mmanyi ekigenda okubaawo eyo.
He has always been very friendly.	Bulijjo abadde wa mukwano nnyo.
It’s not just mine.	Si kyange kyokka.
You have someone.	Olina omuntu.
The same thing can happen to you.	Ekintu kye kimu kiyinza okubaawo ku ggwe.
He knew he wasn’t.	Yali akimanyi nti si bwe yali.
But someone has to do it.	Naye omuntu alina okukikola.
Well.	Bulungi.
Good to know.	Kirungi okumanya.
It is obviously an issue.	Kya lwatu nti nsonga.
A little bit of it.	Katono ddala.
Not bad, he thought.	Si kibi, bwe yalowooza.
You won’t be alone.	Tojja kubeera wekka.
Everyone is dangerous.	Buli muntu wa bulabe.
He was a young guy.	Yali ggaayi muto.
He was my best friend.	Yali mukwano gwange nnyo.
It was.	Yali...
He can swim.	Asobola okuwuga.
You were you.	Ggwe wali ggwe.
it’s really easy.	ddala kyangu.
Another spoke up.	Omulala yayogera.
For a little while they are a city.	Okumala akaseera katono bali kibuga.
Maybe more than that.	Mpozzi okusinga awo.
No, it wasn’t.	Nedda, si bwe yali.
I thought we had a chance.	Nalowooza nti tulina omukisa.
You know what what.	Omanyi kiki kiki.
I'm pretty sure.	Nze nkakasa bulungi.
No, it’s not my business.	Nedda, si nsonga yange.
There is no time for that.	Ekyo tewali budde.
In any case.	Mu mbeera yonna.
Not like we are today.	Si nga bwe tuli leero.
You have to think fast.	Olina okulowooza amangu.
It’s a very common thing to do.	Kintu kya bulijjo nnyo okukola.
It was actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyali kyangu nnyo.
It’s easy and it’s great.	Kyangu era kirungi nnyo.
I was really ready.	Ddala nnali mwetegefu.
he comes every morning.	ajja buli ku makya.
He was done with everything now.	Yali amaze ne buli kimu kati.
Not that he would want to but at this point.	Si nti yandiyagadde naye mu kiseera kino.
This is an ancient city.	Kino kibuga kya dda.
Could he have done it? 	Yali asobola okukikola?
And that’s the point.	Era eyo y’ensonga.
He wasn’t a human being.	Yali si muntu.
I don’t know the answer.	Simanyi kya kuddamu.
We go anywhere.	Tugenda mu kifo kyonna.
There is not much presence.	Tewali nnyo kubeerawo.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
No one was ready.	Tewali yali mwetegefu.
I don't know how.	Simanyi ngeri ki.
Probably really good.	Oboolyawo ddala kirungi nnyo.
I don’t know, really.	Simanyi, ddala.
That looks pretty good.	Ekyo kirabika bulungi nnyo.
And they are watching.	Era bali mu kulaba.
I am a doctor	Nze ndi musawo .
I thought we were best friends.	Nnalowooza nti tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
There is no one there.	Tewali muntu yenna eyo.
Maybe something from me.	Mpozzi ekintu okuva gyendi.
It’s what I love.	Kye kye njagala ennyo.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nali simanyi kiki.
And there isn’t much time.	Era tewali budde bungi.
It’s just the same as it is.	Kye kimu kyokka nga bwe kiri.
He loves to do that.	Ekyo ayagala nnyo okukola.
Don’t go to the office.	Togenda mu ofiisi.
Not at work, not at home.	Si ku mulimu, si waka.
He couldn’t drive a car.	Yali tasobola kuvuga mmotoka.
It would be great, though.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo, wadde.
However, the image doesn’t really matter.	Kyokka, ekifaananyi si nsonga mu butuufu.
He thought maybe he could do it.	Yalowooza nti osanga yali asobola okukikola.
There is no way.	Tewali ngeri yonna.
It’s not one man’s idea.	Si ndowooza ya musajja omu.
He was willing to do anything.	Yali mwetegefu okukola ekintu kyonna.
You have to go.	Olina okugenda.
I hope it’s a great weekend.	Nsuubira nti wiikendi nnungi nnyo.
Only one child.	Mwana omu yekka.
That was really all he could do.	Ekyo ddala kye kyali ekintu kyokka kye yali asobola okukola.
He is in the hospital.	Ali mu ddwaaliro.
You’re in trouble.	Oli mu buzibu.
And he was, as he knew he would be, very good.	Era yali, nga bwe yali amanyi nti ajja kuba, mulungi nnyo.
It was indeed difficult.	Mazima ddala kyali kizibu.
He said it was his idea.	Yagambye nti kye kirowoozo kye.
Not since he left.	Si okuva lwe yagenda.
A lot, actually.	Bingi, mu butuufu.
How long will we stay.	Tujja kumala bbanga ki.
He talks a lot.	Ayogera nnyo.
He often does things like this.	Atera okukola ebintu nga bino.
From the city.	Okuva mu kibuga.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
That’s what we are.	Ekyo kye tuli.
Now, he can go swimming.	Kati, asobola okugenda okuwuga.
I know it well enough.	Nze nkimanyi bulungi.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
He wanted to play.	Yali ayagala kuzannya.
I can’t, actually.	Sisobola, mu butuufu.
This can be a problem.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
It seems so simple.	Kirabika nga kyangu nnyo.
That's not the point.	Eyo si y'ensonga.
That seems good.	Ekyo kirabika kirungi.
Everyone was down.	Buli omu yali wansi.
He certainly doesn’t know.	Mazima ddala tamanyi.
Maybe he did it himself.	Mpozzi nga ye kennyini yakikola.
There is a problem with this though.	Waliwo obuzibu mu nsonga eno wadde.
Apparently one or the other was in constant trouble.	Kirabika omu oba omulala yali mu buzibu buli kiseera.
Indeed, he said.	Mazima ddala, bwe yagambye.
Nothing will ever be the same.	Tewali kintu kyonna kijja kuba kye kimu.
It will be good for me.	Kijja kuba kirungi gyendi.
And that’s what you want.	Era ekyo ky’oyagala.
In point, of course.	Mu nsonga, ddala.
We need to do it.	Twetaaga okukikola.
It’s very difficult for all of us.	Kizibu nnyo eri ffenna.
He can’t know.	Tasobola kumanya.
This was certainly not true.	Mazima ddala kino kyali si kituufu.
No one spoke to him.	Tewali yayogera naye.
And yet, it is.	Era naye, bwe kiri.
But he didn’t need to do that.	Naye yali teyeetaaga kukola ekyo.
He is not strong.	Si wa maanyi.
I had no interest or interest in anything.	Nnali sirina kye njagala oba ekintu kyonna kye njagala.
No, more than that.	Nedda, okusinga ekyo.
We certainly should.	Mazima ddala tusaanidde.
That is my sin.	Ekyo kye kibi kyange.
He was so much more than that.	Yali asinga nnyo ekyo.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Saagala kulaba muntu yenna.
I'll be back soon.	Nja kudda mangu.
Maybe that's why.	Mpozzi y'ensonga lwaki.
I have to go home.	Nnina okudda eka.
But we are moving forward.	Naye tugenda mu maaso.
This is not what it is.	Kino si kye kiri.
He didn’t need one.	Yali teyeetaaga emu.
I don’t even know what to say about that.	Ekyo simanyi na kya kwogera.
I'm going to work.	Ngenda kukola.
He won’t do it.	Tajja kukikola.
Can’t talk to him yourself?	Ggwe kennyini tosobola kwogera naye?
They were already here.	Baali dda wano.
Really, really easy.	Ddala, ddala kyangu.
We have to back off now.	Tulina okudda emabega kati.
I've been in here for a week.	Mbadde mu wano okumala wiiki emu.
However, that is not the case.	Kyokka, ekyo si bwe kiri.
For me, money is nothing.	Nze ssente si kintu.
We can’t stay here.	Tetusobola kusigala wano.
I know why you’re here.	Nkimanyi lwaki oli wano.
Someone has to do it.	Omuntu alina okukikola.
And then you will come.	Era awo ojja kujja.
But he has no time for this at the moment.	Naye kino talina budde mu kiseera kino.
I didn’t think there was.	Nnali sirowooza nti waliwo.
I know you know how to be nice.	Nkimanyi nti omanyi okubeera omulungi.
However, this is the only problem.	Kyokka kino kye kyokka ekizibu.
I don’t want to be here in that situation.	Saagala wano mu mbeera eyo.
We will return to this point below.	Tugenda kudda ku nsonga eno wansi.
I certainly can’t.	Mazima ddala sisobola.
He could have gone.	Yali asobola okugenda.
One thing about him, though.	Kyokka, ekintu kimu ku ye.
You’re here, that’s what matters.	Oli wano, ekyo kye kikulu.
Not even though.	Si wadde nga...
The food is good.	Emmere nnungi.
That was exactly what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali ddala.
He didn’t even need to try.	Yali teyeetaaga na kugezaako.
He knows that.	Ekyo akimanyi.
Is this an answer?	Kino kya kuddamu?
He was himself.	Ye yali ye kennyini.
How have you been?	Obadde otya?
It was absolutely true.	Kyali kituufu ddala.
We are here to help.	Tuli wano okuyamba.
And that problem is actually in play.	Era ekizibu ekyo mu butuufu kiri mu kuzannya.
It's not like that.	Si bw'atyo.
That can be a challenge.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
That’s not a problem.	Ekyo si kizibu.
This can be helpful if one needs to.	Kino kiyinza okuyamba singa omuntu yeetaaga.
It’s not dangerous.	Si kya bulabe.
He just wanted to play with her.	Yali ayagala kuzannya naye yekka.
Apparently he did.	Kirabika yakikola.
He has to go to work every day.	Alina okugenda ku mulimu buli lunaku.
He had to be with her.	Yalina okuba naye.
Not even what you were.	Si wadde kye wali.
This is not dangerous.	Kino si kya bulabe.
Please anyone can help.	Nsaba omuntu yenna asobola okuyamba.
I know, but .	Nkimanyi, naye .
There is a picture.	Waliwo ekifaananyi.
I can’t do anything about this.	Kino sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
And he goes to school.	Era agenda ku ssomero.
He is probably the best player.	Oboolyawo ye muzannyi asinga.
Being in his car.	Okubeera mu mmotoka ye.
But he wasn’t supposed to.	Naye yali tasaanidde kukola.
that was close.	ekyo kyali kumpi.
And there is no one.	Era tewali muntu yenna.
What is this? 	Kino kye ki?
I’m sure he’ll be with you soon.	Nkakasa nti ajja kubeera naawe mu bbanga ttono.
It’s not a bad thing.	Si kintu kibi.
Who really knows.	Ani ddala amanyi.
I can't answer.	Sisobola kuddamu.
You look so awesome about everything.	Olabika otya nnyo ku buli kimu.
He did that tonight.	Ekyo yakikola ekiro kino.
I didn’t know what to do.	Nnali simanyi kya kukola.
Tomorrow night, you will.	Enkya ekiro, ojja.
It was just what we needed.	Kyali kye twali twetaaga kyokka.
I couldn’t find anything.	Nnali sisobola kufuna kintu kyonna.
Now I can’t do it.	Kati sisobola kukikola.
He shouldn’t be left alone.	Talina kusigala yekka.
It is very dangerous.	Kya bulabe nnyo.
John would have to go.	John yandibadde alina okugenda.
You can’t stay.	Tosobola kusigala.
It was a beautiful night.	Ekiro kyali kirungi nnyo.
Now this is the house.	Kati eno ennyumba.
I hoped he was, anyway.	Nali nsuubira nti yali, mu ngeri yonna.
Happy, no that’s not the case.	Musanyufu, nedda ekyo si bwe kiri.
I might be the same.	Nze nnyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
This is a beautiful car.	Eno mmotoka nnungi nnyo.
All or nothing.	Byonna oba tewali.
But you don’t have to.	Naye tolina kukikola.
Good.	Kirungi.
What was he saying?	Yali ayogera ki?
Good, good, this was good.	Kirungi, kirungi, kino kyali kirungi.
I’m working on him.	Nze nkola ku ye.
That’s the problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu.
No issues, either.	Tewali nsonga, era.
It would be a matter of working out what is what.	Kyandibadde nsonga ya kukola ku kiki kye ki.
Must go now, he thought.	Ateekwa okugenda kati, bwe yalowooza.
I’m sure he’ll be back.	Nkakasa nti ajja kudda.
He has something behind him.	Alina ekintu emabega we.
But.	Naye.
Here and everywhere.	Wano ne buli wamu.
He now lives at home.	Kati abeera waka.
He looked happy.	Yalabika nga musanyufu.
You’ve been here.	Obadde wano.
None of his reasons.	Tewali nsonga ye yonna.
He didn't know in which direction.	Yali tamanyi mu ludda ki.
He was thinking.	Yali alowooza.
I don’t care.	Sifaayo.
He doesn’t like anyone.	Tayagala muntu yenna.
Maybe everything.	Mpozzi buli kimu.
And we can talk.	Era tusobola okwogera.
This isn’t mine.	Kino si kyange.
He went to many parties.	Yagenda ku mbaga nnyingi.
You can do this in advance.	Kino osobola okukikola nga bukyali.
He is dangerous.	Wa bulabe.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Era si kibi.
Obviously it was.	Kya lwatu bwe kyali.
That's the point.	Eyo y'ensonga.
That’s all we need.	Ekyo kye twetaaga kyokka.
I want to talk to you a bit.	Njagala kwogera naawe katono.
I will address this.	Kino nja kukola ku nsonga eno.
He makes things happen.	Akola ebintu okubaawo.
We have a lot to do.	Tulina bingi bye tulina okukola.
I hope they are.	Nsuubira nti bwe bali.
You will be answered.	Ojja kuddamu.
You can do that with us.	Ekyo osobola okukikola nga tulina ggwe.
At this point I couldn’t do anything right.	Mu kiseera kino nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna kituufu.
And he was very happy.	Era nga musanyufu nnyo.
I need in the future.	Nze nneetaaga mu maaso.
And there it is to this day.	Era eyo gye kiri n’okutuusa leero.
But he wasn’t young.	Naye yali si muto.
He will have to go to the hospital tomorrow.	Agenda kuba alina okugenda mu ddwaaliro enkya.
He already knew that, of course.	Ekyo yali akimanyi dda, ddala.
I’m not quite myself yet.	Nze n’okutuusa kati siri ddala nze kennyini.
I don’t want anyone to know.	Saagala muntu yenna kumanya.
You know, pretty simple as that.	Omanyi, kirungi nnyo nga kyangu nga ekyo.
It looks really good.	Kirabika bulungi ddala.
It’s not really a problem.	Mu butuufu si kizibu.
I'm glad he's here.	Ndi musanyufu nti ali wano.
Driving is dangerous.	Okuvuga mmotoka kya bulabe.
He was very good in practice.	Yali mulungi nnyo mu nkola.
He is a very nice person.	Omuntu mulungi nnyo.
I’m so sorry, but .	Nsonyiwa nnyo, naye .
Or you don’t have one.	Oba tolina emu.
He was much better at it.	Yali asinga nnyo mu nsonga eyo.
However, it can happen to anyone.	Kyokka, kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna.
It’s early in the morning.	Buli ku makya ennyo.
We are moving forward.	Tugenda mu maaso.
But that’s easy.	Naye ekyo kyangu.
I knew where this was going.	Kino nnali mmanyi gye kyali kigenda.
Doing anything about it.	Okukola ekintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
You have to know where it is.	Olina okumanya gye kiri.
The phone started ringing.	Essimu yatandika okukuba.
What a privilege it is!	Nga mukisa gwa maanyi nnyo!
It’s not a real job.	Si mulimu gwa ddala.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
He was much younger than us.	Yali muto nnyo okusinga ffe.
There is nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna.
I should be doing my job.	Nsaanidde okuba nga nkola omulimu gwange.
I just didn’t know.	Nze nali simanyi kyokka.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
And he would work.	Era yandikoze.
His friend had to do it.	Mukwano gwe yali alina okukikola.
Just knowing that.	Okumanya ekyo kyokka.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
And maybe not.	Era mpozzi nedda.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
This was not his room.	Kino si kye kyali kisenge kye.
I’m not sure if that’s a good idea or not.	Sikakasa oba ekyo kirowoozo kirungi oba nedda.
I really feel like we have at that point.	Nze ddala mpulira nga tulina mu kiseera ekyo.
It’s not too difficult.	Si kizibu nnyo.
I want to read that book.	Njagala okusoma ekitabo ekyo.
I am suddenly terrified.	Nze ntya nnyo mu bwangu.
But that’s not the same thing.	Naye ekyo si kye kimu.
I didn’t want to be in a movie.	Nnali saagala kubeera mu firimu.
But not in this house.	Naye si mu nnyumba eno.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
Something is going on.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
It is much easier to read now.	Kyangu nnyo okusoma kati.
As difficult as that can be.	Nga ekyo bwe kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
In that case, it will be fine.	Mu mbeera eyo, kijja kuba kirungi.
And you, too, my friend.	Era naawe mukwano gwange.
I know what the problem is!	Nze mmanyi obuzibu bwe buli!
At the time it seemed like nothing.	Mu kiseera ekyo kyali kirabika nga tewali kintu kyonna.
We can’t do it.	Tetusobola kukikola.
That was a real problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu ddala.
Let me feel you are near.	Ka mpulira nga oli kumpi.
I am very happy to do this work.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okukola omulimu guno.
Good to have you this morning.	Kirungi okubeera naawe enkya ya leero.
It is best to arrive early.	Kirungi okutuuka nga bukyali.
I don’t know if this is true though.	Simanyi oba kino kituufu wadde.
That was the point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga.
This was more serious than he had imagined.	Kino kyali kya maanyi nnyo okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
He was obviously very sick.	Kya lwatu nti yali mulwadde nnyo.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
Everything you wanted to do really well.	Buli kimu wali oyagala okukola obulungi ddala.
I have to get back to work.	Nnina okudda ku mulimu.
It is very important '.	Kikulu nnyo '.
You have, of course.	Olina, ddala.
In the same room.	Mu kisenge kimu.
That’s not quite true.	Ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
You’re beautiful, too.	Naawe oli mulungi.
One thing is certain, though.	Kyokka, ekintu kimu kiri nti.
He was obviously very happy.	Kya lwatu nti yali musanyufu nnyo.
I guess there is a reason.	Ntebereza nti waliwo ensonga lwaki.
We have to talk.	Tulina okwogera.
And it will work well.	Era kijja kukola bulungi.
It was time to speak up.	Kyali kiseera okwogera.
I love how it looks.	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kirabika.
I’ve been thinking about you.	Mbadde ndowooza ku ggwe.
Everyone was working on the same thing.	Buli omu yali akola ku kintu kimu.
I know we can do it.	Nkimanyi nti tusobola okukikola.
Good or bad.	Kirungi oba kibi.
Of course he had to.	Kya lwatu yalina okukikola.
But there isn’t.	Naye tewali.
In fact, it could have been much worse.	Mu butuufu, kiyinza okuba nga kyali kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He was very lonely.	Yali yekka nnyo.
You don’t have to do anything.	Tolina kukola kintu kyonna.
However, I don’t want to.	Kyokka saagala.
This is my point.	Eno y’ensonga yange.
That’s very important to me.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo gyendi.
He knew he did it.	Yali akimanyi nti yakikola.
That’s what he told me.	Ekyo kye yangamba.
You are the best.	Ggwe asinga obulungi.
Apparently he didn’t have much.	Kirabika yali talina bingi.
I was the only one.	Nze nnali nzekka.
Yeah, yeah.	Ye ye.
And he was the only one.	Era ye yali yekka.
I probably didn’t want to know.	Oboolyawo nnali saagala kumanya.
He talked to me all night.	Yayogera nange ekiro kyonna.
It was something much more important than that.	Kyali kintu kikulu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
You know that.	Ekyo okimanyi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He knew this.	Kino yali akimanyi.
He was very, very young.	Yali muto nnyo nnyo.
It’s going to be very close.	Kigenda kuba kumpi nnyo.
But it was something.	Naye kyali kintu.
Money is nothing.	Ssente si kintu kyonna.
But not with him.	Naye si naye.
You can’t be everything to everyone.	Tosobola kuba buli kimu eri buli muntu.
I thought it would be really hard but it wasn’t.	Nalowooza nti ddala kijja kuba kizibu naye si bwe kyali.
That’s not me either.	Oyo si nze nange.
He says it’s time.	Agamba nti kye kiseera.
He won’t come to you.	Tajja kujja gy’oli.
And yet not much of the same.	Era naye si bingi ku kimu.
I have no problem doing that.	Ekyo sirina buzibu kukola.
He couldn’t wait to get home.	Yali tasobola kulinda kudda waka.
It may be the same for you.	Kiyinza okuba nga kye kimu ne ggwe.
You could make a lot of money.	Oyinza okufuna ssente nnyingi.
He was obviously excited to go for a ride.	Kya lwatu nti yali musanyufu nnyo okugenda okuvuga.
He has always been good to you.	Bulijjo abadde mulungi gy’oli.
We have to do this.	Kino tulina okukikola.
He doesn’t have to be strong in love.	Talina kuba wa maanyi mu kwagala.
But perhaps it might work better.	Naye oboolyawo kiyinza okukola obulungi.
No one knew where he went or why.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yagenda oba lwaki.
We can’t continue to be together.	Tetusobola kugenda mu maaso na kubeera ffembi.
He was in good shape.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi.
He is going to love this.	Kino agenda kwagala nnyo.
It could have been anyone.	Kyandibadde omuntu yenna.
He's a movie, but he's real.	Ye firimu, naye ye wa ddala.
None of this is real.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kya ddala.
He had no choice, he would have to.	Yali talina kya kukola, yandibadde alina okukikola.
You will never know why.	Tojja kumanya lwaki.
But there is.	Naye waliwo...
It’s not too bad.	Si kibi nnyo.
I'll stay.	Nja kusigala.
But that’s not really the point here.	Naye mu butuufu eyo si y’ensonga wano.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
Perhaps he did.	Oboolyawo yakikola.
No, no, no, no, no.	Nedda nedda nedda nedda nedda.
He'll be home tomorrow night.	Ajja kudda waka enkya ekiro.
And then.	Era awo.
And, well he shouldn’t.	Era, bulungi tasaanidde kukikola.
It was the perfect place.	Kyali kifo kituufu nnyo.
You are beautiful.	Oli mulungi.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
He went quickly.	Yagenda mu bwangu.
I have no issue with that.	Ekyo sirina nsonga yonna.
He must do it whether he wants to or not.	Ateekwa okukikola oba ayagala oba nedda.
And he would do it too.	Era naye yandikoze.
No one says he did.	Tewali agamba nti yakikola.
This is really awful.	Kino ddala kibi nnyo.
It is true that we are in danger.	Kituufu nti tuli mu bulabe.
This is a powerful thing.	Kino kintu kya maanyi.
It’s his wedding.	Ye mbaga ye.
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola.
But there was no room.	Naye nga tewali kifo.
Maybe you’re ready, maybe you’re not.	Mpozzi nga oli mwetegefu, mpozzi nga toli mwetegefu.
He spoke in congregation.	Yayogera mu kibiina.
He said why not.	Yagambye nti lwaki nedda.
I mostly expected it, as well.	Nze okusinga nnali nsuubira, nga bwe kiri.
I love to win.	Njagala nnyo okuwangula.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
It’s a problem, it’s a real problem.	Kizibu, kizibu kya ddala.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
I’ve got a lot.	Nfunye bingi.
You probably know why.	Oboolyawo omanyi ensonga lwaki.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Simanyi kigenda mu maaso.
Now it’s everywhere.	Kati kiri buli wamu.
This was very easy.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo.
Where was he supposed to be.	Yalina okubeera wa.
I thought he was a really nice guy.	Nalowooza nti ddala ggaayi mulungi.
In this case, however, that is not true.	Kyokka mu mbeera eno, ekyo si kituufu.
I just knew it.	Nze nnali mmanyi kyokka.
He can’t do that.	Ekyo tasobola kukikola.
True, he did.	Kituufu, yakikola.
He is his friend.	Ye mukwano gwe.
He thought for a moment about what he should do.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera ku ky’alina okukola.
And very happy about it.	Era nga musanyufu nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
That wasn’t the plan.	Eyo si ye yali enteekateeka.
He couldn't say anything.	Yali tasobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
What do you want to eat?	Kiki ky’oyagala okulya?
But he knows it’s early.	Naye akimanyi nti bukyali.
I am very sick.	Ndi mulwadde nnyo.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
He was close to me anyway.	Yali kumpi nange mu ngeri yonna.
I can’t believe it.	Siyinza kukkiriza.
I love making movies.	Njagala nnyo okukola firimu.
That will come next week.	Ekyo kijja kujja wiiki ejja.
Like everything was fine.	Nga buli kimu bwe kyali kirungi.
Same with last week.	Kye kimu ne wiiki ewedde.
When it was us.	Bwe kyali ffe.
We are together.	Tuli ba wamu.
But this is not what it is.	Naye kino si kye kiri.
I said it was mine.	Nagamba nti kyange.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
I loved it, as did he.	Nze nnali njagala nnyo, nga naye bwe yakola.
I know what my problem is.	Nze mmanyi ekizibu kyange kye kiri.
It's coming.	Kijja.
And it was much easier to do the thing right.	Era kyali kyangu nnyo okukola ekintu ekyo obulungi.
What and a person?	Kiki era omuntu?
It’s time to move on.	Kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
Sorry.	Nsonyiwa.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
There is nothing here for me now.	Tewali kintu kyonna wano gyendi kati.
What he knew.	Kye yali amanyi.
For anyone and everyone here.	Ku muntu yenna na buli muntu wano.
I have to go home soon.	Nnina okudda eka mangu.
It may be true.	Kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
No one will stay here.	Tewali ajja kusigala wano.
And he knows it, too.	Era akimanyi, naye.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
He would have been there.	Yandibadde awo.
But that was just me.	Naye ekyo nnali nze nzekka.
I wanted one in my house.	Nnali njagala emu mu nnyumba yange.
Good in theory.	Kirungi mu ndowooza.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
He wasn’t happy.	Yali si musanyufu.
Felt good though.	Yawulira bulungi wadde.
Then it was.	Awo bwe kyali.
But, we shall see.	Naye, tujja kulaba.
He was telling the truth.	Yali ayogera mazima.
And you have absolutely no idea.	Era tolina n’akatono kirowoozo kyonna.
They are with me.	Bali nange.
There is plenty of help for everyone.	Waliwo obuyambi bungi eri buli muntu.
I'll see if you can do that.	Nja kulaba oba ekyo osobola okukikola.
You want to stay there.	Oyagala kusigala awo.
So much for this.	Bingi nnyo kino.
He was very thoughtful.	Yali alowooza nnyo.
I can do anything.	Nsobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
He was going home.	Yali agenda okudda eka.
That’s really important.	Ekyo ddala kikulu nnyo.
But well, maybe this isn’t a problem.	Naye bulungi, mpozzi kino si kizibu.
I can live well.	Nsobola okubeera obulungi.
I don’t really have an opinion.	Mu butuufu sirina ndowooza.
But it’s not true.	Naye si kituufu.
And, of course it is.	Era, ddala bwe kiri.
I will.	Nja.
I'll talk to him.	Nja kwogera naye.
Not me, by any means.	Si nze, mu ngeri yonna.
To us.	Eri ffe.
I don’t think this is the case.	Sirowooza nti kino bwe kiri.
He is there, in front of his friends.	Ali awo, mu maaso ne mikwano gye.
He wanted so much so much.	Yali ayagala bingi nnyo bingi nnyo.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
I do but that doesn’t matter now.	Nze nkola naye ekyo si kikulu kati.
He loves to read.	Ayagala nnyo okusoma.
He was just here.	Yali wano yekka.
I was a young child.	Nnali mwana muto.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
I needed time to process.	Nnali nneetaaga obudde okukola ku nsonga.
He knew where he belonged.	Yali akimanyi nti wa eyo.
One is not very good.	Omu si mulungi nnyo.
But now he knew that wasn't true.	Naye kati yali akimanyi nti ekyo si kituufu.
But, that was it.	Naye, ekyo kye kyali.
It’s going to be up to us.	Kigenda kubeera eri ffe.
Another opportunity for everyone.	Omukisa omulala eri buli muntu.
I didn’t know his plans.	Nnali simanyi nteekateeka ze.
Maybe he does but it’s very unlikely.	Mpozzi akola naye nga si kya bulijjo nnyo.
While that’s true, it’s not that important.	Wadde ng’ekyo kituufu, si kikulu nnyo.
You have to act quickly.	Olina okukola amangu.
Towards.	Eri.
I was powerless myself.	Nze kennyini nnali sirina maanyi.
We have plenty of time.	Tulina obudde bungi.
He knew what it was.	Yali amanyi kye kyali.
He is alone there.	Ali yekka eyo.
When we come.	Bwe tujja.
You can really see everything.	Ddala osobola okulaba buli kimu.
We probably already were.	Oboolyawo twali dda.
He will know.	Ajja kumanya.
It is good to shop every day.	Kirungi okugula ebintu buli lunaku.
But he went away very happy.	Naye yagenda nga musanyufu nnyo.
I don't know.	Simanyi.
No, not now.	Nedda, si kati.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
Not very friendly.	Si wa mukwano nnyo.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
All in one.	Byonna mu kimu.
Maybe there is such a thing.	Mpozzi waliwo ekintu ng’ekyo.
However, I want one.	Kyokka njagala emu.
That's the point.	Eyo y'ensonga.
You don’t have to do this now.	Kino tolina kukikola kati.
Probably of his wife.	Oboolyawo wa mukyala we.
He loves his job.	Ayagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
He tried to talk but couldn't.	Yagezaako okwogera naye nga tasobola.
I think he is good.	Ndowooza ye nnungi.
This is not easy to do.	Kino si kyangu kukikola.
He had to win.	Yalina okuwangula.
You can’t see to that.	Tosobola kulaba ku ekyo.
I hear you.	Mpulira.
And then it wasn’t.	Era awo si bwe kyali.
And there is absolutely no reason why it should be.	Era tewali nsonga yonna lwaki kyandibadde.
He may have done it before.	Ayinza okuba nga yakikola emabegako.
That's what 'where'	Ekyo kye 'wa'.
That’s not true.	Si ekyo kituufu.
You really aren’t very good.	Mazima ddala toli mulungi nnyo.
And it is the same.	Era bwe kiri.
I know it will happen as well.	Nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo nga bwe kyali.
It’s not really that easy to say.	Mu butuufu si kyangu nnyo kwogera.
And that was probably a good thing.	Era ekyo oboolyawo kyali kirungi.
It’s really pretty cool.	Ddala kirungi nnyo.
That seems like a bad idea.	Ekyo kirabika nga kirowoozo kibi.
You have to step back.	Olina okudda emabega.
I’ve been thinking about you.	Mbadde ndowooza ku ggwe.
It’s not about me.	Si ku nze.
You were there.	Ggwe wali awo.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
I loved my father.	Taata nnali njagala nnyo.
We can know this.	Kino tusobola okumanya.
And now, he won’t.	Era kati, tajja kukikola.
Everyone is so nice.	Buli muntu mulungi nnyo.
He said he was fine.	Yagambye nti ali bulungi.
Just a book.	Ekitabo kyokka.
Why don’t you go now? 	Lwaki togenda kati?
. . . .	.
Now let me think about it.	Kati ka ndowooza.
But that’s my brother’s business.	Naye eyo nsonga ya muganda wange.
He wanted to drive, but he couldn’t.	Yali ayagala kuvuga, naye nga tasobola.
Now, it’s not too bad.	Kati, si kibi nnyo.
I, too, was going.	Nange, nnali ngenda.
How are you doing.	Ggwe ali atya.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
I plan to read one at night.	Nteekateeka okusoma emu ekiro.
He did it.	Yakikola.
Which is very, very hard to do.	Ekintu ekizibu ennyo ennyo okukola.
He started in the front.	Yatandika mu maaso.
I wanted to see again.	Nnali njagala okuddamu okulaba.
He has a reason.	Alina ensonga.
It doesn’t really matter here.	Wano si kikulu nnyo.
If only it were normal.	Singa kyali kya bulijjo.
You go right ahead.	Ggwe ogenda mu maaso ddala.
That was him.	Oyo ye yali ye.
And we are .	Era tuli .
It’s hard to see in this gloomy room.	Kizibu okulaba mu kisenge kino ekizibu.
Who wants to drive?	Ani ayagala okuvuga?
And that’s right.	Era ekyo kituufu.
That's his whole thing.	Ekyo kye kintu kye kyonna.
He wants to get in shape.	Ayagala kufuna mu mbeera.
Like he wanted it that way.	Nga bwe yali ayagala bw’atyo.
He is working on the issue.	Ali mu kukola ku nsonga.
My father also had a job back there.	Taata naye yalina omulimu emabega awo.
However, I don’t know why.	Kyokka simanyi lwa ki.
He had to do it.	Yalina okukikola.
Your plan will work.	Enteekateeka yo ejja kukola.
We don’t have anything.	Tetulina kye tulina.
I have no idea what it is.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki.
I can’t believe he’s here.	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ali wano.
I thought it was good.	Nalowooza nti kirungi.
He didn’t want to do this.	Kino yali tayagala kukikola.
And mostly true.	Era okusinga kituufu.
It was really easy actually.	Ddala kyali kyangu mu butuufu.
Practical considerations are important.	Okulowooza ku nkola kikulu.
I have a dog who is my son.	Nnina embwa nga ye mwana wange.
You can watch it here.	Osobola okulaba wano.
I’m sure it’s not.	Nkakasa nti si bwe kiri.
And you will do it.	Era ojja kukikola.
He likes to be busy.	Ayagala nnyo okubeera bbize.
They are in a difficult time.	Bali mu kiseera kizibu.
We didn’t have .	Twali tetulina .
You have to think ahead.	Olina okulowooza mu maaso.
I’m not happy.	Nze siri musanyufu.
Someone else does.	Omuntu omulala akola.
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kintu kirungi.
I was the only one.	Nali nze nzekka.
He was actually quite interested.	Mu butuufu yali ayagala nnyo.
He wanted to be alone.	Yali ayagala kubeera yekka.
But he may not try the role.	Naye kiyinza okuba nga tajja kugezaako kifo ekyo.
You know what this is.	Omanyi kino kye kiri.
You know it’s coming, and it’s coming.	Omanyi nti kijja, era kijja.
What a great idea.	Nga ndowooza nnungi nnyo.
I have no idea about that.	Ekyo sirina kye mmanyi.
No one could tell.	Tewali yali asobola kumanya.
Don’t know how to do it.	Tomanyi ngeri ya kukikola.
Probably a lot of time.	Oboolyawo obudde bungi.
I know you can.	Nkimanyi nti osobola.
He may be asleep.	Ayinza okuba nga yeebase.
I can’t talk to you.	Sisobola kwogera naawe.
I’m sorry it was him.	Nsonyiwa yali ye.
He told me he did.	Yang’amba nti yakikola.
His best friend.	Mukwano gwe asinga.
You are not real.	Toli wa ddala.
I don’t have any problems.	Sirina buzibu bwonna.
But only in this place.	Naye mu kifo kino kyokka.
She is a very nice lady.	Mukyala mulungi nnyo.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
And that’s what it is.	Era ekyo kye.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
But I am happy now.	Naye ndi musanyufu kati.
He didn’t want to talk about his situation.	Yali tayagala kwogera ku mbeera ye.
We are lucky to have him here.	Tulina omukisa okubeera naye wano.
And anyone can do it.	Era omuntu yenna asobola okukikola.
She loved dogs.	Yali ayagala nnyo embwa.
I forgive everything like you.	Nze buli kimu nsonyiwa nga ggwe.
No he won’t do it.	Nedda tajja kukikola.
That won’t do it.	Ekyo tekijja kukikola.
To be alone from it all.	Okubeera wekka okuva mu byonna.
Or for you.	Oba lwa ggwe.
Not that one, either.	Si oyo, era.
I certainly should.	Mazima ddala nsaanidde.
However, that it is difficult to do so.	Kyokka nti kizibu okukikola.
This was harder than he expected.	Kino kyali kizibu okusinga bwe yali asuubira.
And that’s me.	Era oyo nze.
His manner was good.	Engeri ye yali nnungi.
I can’t say when.	Siyinza kwogera ddi.
I’m not involved.	Nze siri mu nsonga.
No one could.	Tewali yali asobola.
Really, it’s just beautiful.	Ddala, kirungi kyokka.
He wanted to know what she wanted to know.	Yali ayagala okumanya kye yali ayagala okumanya.
He has already done it.	Amaze okukikola.
Here's my problem.	Wano ekizibu kyange.
It could be anything.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
I’m not going to go over everything again.	Sigenda kuddamu kugenda ku buli kimu.
Now he lives alone.	Kati abeera yekka.
Now there is no danger.	Kati tewali bulabe.
This does not seem to be the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
Not to us.	Si gye tuli.
We’ll play together.	Tujja kuzannya wamu.
That’s what it is.	Kye kiri.
He was in a lot of trouble.	Yali mu buzibu bungi nnyo.
I knew my job.	Omulimu gwange nnali mmanyi.
He didn’t have the room to do it.	Yali talina kisenge kya kukikola.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
He felt he had to leave.	Yawulira nti alina okuva awo.
However, he was a wonderful father.	Kyokka yali taata mulungi nnyo.
I was well aware of that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi bulungi.
And he was ready.	Era yali mwetegefu.
You will be the one.	Ggwe ojja kuba.
It was a wonderful time to be there.	Kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo okubeera eyo.
Now he is very close.	Kati ali kumpi nnyo.
Getting to a certain point.	Okutuuka ku nsonga emu.
It won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo.
He wanted to know, he had to know.	Yali ayagala okumanya, yalina okumanya.
And the party.	Wa kabaga.
That you are not on his side.	Nti toli ku ludda lwe.
Not that you were.	Si nti wali.
No one spoke to me.	Tewali yayogera nange.
This is where the problem lies.	Wano obuzibu we buli.
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
And of course everywhere.	Era ddala buli wamu.
What he wants.	Kye ayagala.
He worked hard.	Yakola nnyo.
It’s hard to do.	Kizibu okukola.
You would love that.	Ekyo wandyagadde nnyo.
And much in this way was the case with me.	Era bingi mu ngeri eno bwe kyali nange.
He did it very early on.	Yakikola nga bukyali nnyo.
I just think it is.	Nze ndowooza kyokka nti bwe kiri.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
I can't even.	Sisobola wadde.
It’s a very simple idea.	Kirowoozo kyangu nnyo.
I guess it could happen.	Ntebereza nti kiyinza okubaawo.
Everyone but him.	Buli muntu okuggyako ye.
I genuinely love this product.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino mu mazima.
This thing?	Ekintu kino?
Everything seems right.	Buli kimu kirabika kituufu.
He is a very nice man.	Musajja mulungi nnyo.
He is in trouble.	Ali mu buzibu.
Not us, not me.	Si ffe, si nze.
You just have to do it.	Olina okukikola kyokka.
He had no time for that kind of thinking.	Yali talina budde bwa ndowooza ya ngeri eyo.
That's mine.	Oyo wange.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
And his friend.	Era mukwano gwe.
Someone can do that.	Omuntu asobola okukola ekyo.
I have no idea what’s going on.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
This may be the case.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kye kituufu.
He said he knew.	Yagambye nti amanyi.
It is very easy to read.	Kyangu nnyo okusoma.
Reaching them will be much easier.	Okutuuka gye bali kijja kuba kyangu nnyo.
This isn’t a bad thing.	Kino si kibi.
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
But here we are.	Naye wano we tuli.
And it’s good that you should.	Era kirungi nti olina okukikola.
And it was great for me.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo gyendi.
You’ll be here.	Ojja kuba wano.
All or nothing.	Byonna oba tewali.
Now he was safe.	Kati yali talina bulabe.
There is no money.	Tewali ssente.
He had a friend, obviously.	Yalina mukwano gwe, nga kirabika.
You have to work to earn money.	Olina okukola okufuna ssente.
I’m ready now.	Nze ndi mwetegefu kati.
And there is a reason.	Era waliwo ensonga.
Maybe you’re a little.	Mpozzi nga oli katono.
Now he felt everything.	Kati yawulira buli kimu.
He likes to talk to his friends.	Ayagala nnyo okwogera ne mikwano gye.
This is the time.	Kino kye kiseera.
I needed to talk.	Nnali nneetaaga okwogera.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I’m not entirely sure myself.	Nze kennyini sikakasa ddala.
He had to be like.	Yalina okuba nga.
We’re all going.	Ffenna tugenda.
And we are lucky.	Era tuli ba mukisa.
He was supposed to know things.	Ye yali alina okumanya ebintu.
He is afraid of the police.	Atya poliisi.
To be with us.	Okubeera naffe.
Or talk about it.	Oba okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
We were moving forward.	Twali tugenda mu maaso.
But tomorrow he will be.	Naye enkya ajja kuba.
He was going to be fine.	Yali agenda kubeera bulungi.
He actually did it.	Mu butuufu yakikola.
At the time he was very ill.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali mulwadde nnyo.
It looks good to me.	Kirabika bulungi gyendi.
I could hardly believe it.	Nnali sisobola n’akatono kukkiriza.
Speaking in response.	Okwogera mu kuddamu.
Mostly him, actually.	Okusinga ye, mu butuufu.
This house needs it.	Ennyumba eno yeetaaga.
This is very powerful.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo.
But there is nothing to say.	Naye tewali kya kwogera.
This feels right to me.	Kino mpulira nga kituufu gyendi.
There is one in every school.	Mu buli ssomero mulimu emu.
It was really a thing of beauty.	Ddala kyali kintu kya bulungi.
But your point is good.	Naye ensonga yo nnungi.
He just hoped it wasn't him.	Yali asuubira kyokka nti si ye.
Nothing seems too important.	Tewali kirabika kikulu nnyo.
I’m feeling better.	Mbeera bulungi.
He does what he has to do.	Akola ky’alina okukola.
But he wasn’t exactly like that.	Naye yali si bw’atyo ddala.
I love it so much.	Nnyo njagala nnyo.
He had been here.	Yali abadde wano.
That’s a terrible thing.	Ekyo kibi nnyo.
I just know it.	Nze mmanyi kyokka.
It is very dangerous right now.	Kya bulabe nnyo mu kiseera kino.
It was what he wanted.	Kyali kye yali ayagala.
But he is what he is.	Naye ye ky’ali.
But not too busy.	Naye si bbize nnyo.
The plan was complete	Enteekateeka yali ewedde
He didn't want to, but he had to.	Yali tayagala naye yalina okukikola.
I think that’s pretty cool.	Ndowooza ekyo kirungi nnyo.
Certainly not, he thought.	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri, bwe yalowooza.
We have a serious problem!.	Tulina kizibu nnyo!.
But he probably did.	Naye oboolyawo yakikola.
I love it so much.	Nze njagala nnyo.
To move forward.	Okugenda mu maaso.
This was a real situation for me.	Eno yali mbeera ya ddala gyendi.
He will come on time.	Ajja kujja mu budde.
And we are.	Era ffe tuli.
But still nothing.	Naye nga n’okutuusa kati tewali kintu kyonna.
He probably would.	Oboolyawo yandikoze.
He was going to.	Yali agenda.
And it’s not very good, either.	Era si kirungi nnyo, era.
I don’t have anything.	Nze sirina kintu kyonna.
It would be a great place.	Kyandibadde kifo kirungi nnyo.
Just like the book.	Nga ekitabo bwe kiri.
Can you please answer that?	Nsaba osobola okuddamu ekyo?
I'm sure!	Nkakasa!
He's ready to go.	Mwetegefu okugenda.
I like being in my own space.	Njagala nnyo okubeera mu kifo kyange.
I can’t win with him.	Sisobola kuwangula naye.
I have nothing to do with him.	Sirina kye nkola ku ye.
I don’t feel anything.	Nze sirina kye mpulira.
I was feeling pretty good.	Nnali mpulira bulungi nnyo.
Knowledge is not faith.	Okumanya si kukkiriza.
That’s all there is to it.	Ekyo kye kiri kyokka.
You are that person.	Ggwe muntu oyo.
I and he himself had money.	Nze naye ye kennyini yalina ssente.
And it will happen.	Era kijja kubaawo.
Now you have a problem.	Kati olina ekizibu.
And that’s not the same thing.	Era ekyo si kye kimu.
No one knows what to do.	Tewali amanyi kya kukola.
This is important to me, son.	Kino kikulu gyendi mwana.
I'm afraid nothing good.	Nze ntya tewali kirungi.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
At the time that I knew.	Mu kiseera ekyo kye nnali mmanyi.
When he saw my father.	Bwe yalaba taata wange.
A guy that no one really knew.	Ggaayi nga tewali amanyi ddala.
And it was good.	Era kyali kirungi.
I need to talk to him now.	Nze kati nneetaaga okwogera naye.
This is what he wants.	Kino ky’ayagala.
I need so much more.	Nze nneetaaga bingi nnyo.
I am sick of my job.	Nze omulimu gwange ndi mulwadde.
Like this house.	Nga ennyumba eno.
He should have known better.	Yandibadde amanyi bulungi.
I’m at home.	Nze ndi waka.
In my room.	Mu kisenge kyange.
I wish he would have.	Njagala yandibadde.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Yali amanyi bulungi kye yali akola.
But one need not dwell on that for long.	Naye omuntu teyeetaaga kusigala ku ekyo okumala ebbanga ddene.
I have one of them.	Nze nnina emu.
Always, always, always.	Bulijjo, bulijjo, bulijjo.
Not too long ago.	Si bbanga ddene nnyo emabega.
I have no problem with that one.	Oyo sirina buzibu bwonna.
And of course, it’s not.	Era ddala, si bwe kiri.
Not us, actually.	Si ffe, mu butuufu.
To move forward.	Okugenda mu maaso.
No one knew where.	Tewali yali amanyi wa.
No one lives there.	Tewali abeera eyo.
Here's everything he had to say.	Wano byonna bye yalina okwogera.
We have to address the issue.	Tulina okukola ku nsonga.
Here and there.	Wano ne wali.
I think you are one.	Ndowooza oli omu.
But maybe this is just fine.	Naye mpozzi kino kiri bulungi nnyo.
That, of course, was easier said than done.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kyali kyangu okwogera okusinga okukikola.
I won’t preach.	Sijja kubuulira.
We are in the moment.	Ffe tuli mu kiseera kino.
That will never happen again.	Ekyo tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
It probably doesn’t matter.	Oboolyawo si kikulu.
That’s pretty easy.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
I know how that is.	Nze mmanyi engeri ekyo gye kiri.
It’s up to me.	Kiri ku nze.
Now he had three.	Kati yalina ssatu.
You’re moving forward.	Ggwe ogenda mu maaso.
Everyone was going.	Buli omu yali agenda.
However, there is still no answer.	Kyokka, n’okutuusa kati tewali kuddamu.
That one.	Oyo omu.
This is his city.	Kino kye kibuga kye.
That’s where we are today.	Awo we tuli leero.
This was actually the case.	Kino mu butuufu bwe kyali.
No, that was serious.	Nedda, ekyo kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
She is fine and will be happy soon.	Ali bulungi era mu bbanga ttono ajja kuba musanyufu.
It was a difficult time for both of us.	Kyali kiseera kizibu gye tuli ffembi.
But that’s not what’s going on here.	Naye ekyo si kye kigenda mu maaso wano.
It’s completely up to you.	Kiri gy’oli ddala.
No one seems to know what’s going on.	Alabika tewali amanyi kigenda mu maaso.
It can be anything you want.	Kiyinza okuba kyonna ky’oyagala.
As easy as it would be.	Nga bwe kyandibadde kyangu.
I was happy, though.	Kyokka nnali musanyufu.
He was his normal self.	Yali muntu we wa bulijjo.
Morning.	Ku makya.
I know this.	Kino nkimanyi.
But maybe not.	Naye mpozzi nedda.
He obviously has his own problem.	Kya lwatu nti alina ekizibu kye.
I don't know why.	Simanyi lwa ki.
You are doing very well.	Okola bulungi nnyo.
There is no working around this problem.	Tewali kukola ku kizibu kino.
And it was a thing of beauty.	Era kyali kintu kya bulungi.
But it is the case.	Naye bwe kiri.
Or just me.	Oba nze nzekka.
And it is this.	Era kye kino.
It was him.	Yali ye.
But, there seems to be a problem.	Naye, kirabika waliwo ekizibu.
Dogs are man’s best friend.	Embwa mukwano gwa muntu asinga.
But you are a busy man.	Naye oli musajja bbize.
However, it is not one and the same.	Kyokka, si kimu era kye kimu.
He won't have any of that.	Tajja kuba na kimu ku ebyo.
The whole thing was bad on every side.	Ekintu kyonna kyali kibi ku buli ludda.
However, in my case it was not.	Kyokka mu mbeera yange si bwe kyali.
Only the father.	Taata yekka.
Let me.	Ka nze.
Not exactly a wedding.	Si bulungi mbaga.
He said it might help.	Yagambye nti kiyinza okuyamba.
It’s not a date.	Si lunaku.
Unless, of course, he already knew.	Okuggyako nga, kya lwatu, yali akimanyi dda.
He had plenty of time.	Yalina obudde bungi.
This is completely up to you.	Kino kiri gy’oli ddala.
But three it was.	Naye ssatu bwe kyali.
Or in this case.	Oba mu mbeera eno.
And it’s so bad.	Era kibi nnyo.
Everyone knew it well.	Buli omu yali akimanyi bulungi.
In a sense, they were.	Mu ngeri emu, baali.
He would like that.	Ekyo yandiyagadde.
But not today.	Kyokka si leero.
reaching rather than being.	okutuuka okusinga okubeera.
There is nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna.
Nothing is more important than that.	Tewali kikulu okusinga ekyo.
But you’re going.	Naye ggwe ogenda.
What are you doing today?	Okola ki leero?
Not that there was anything he could do about it.	Si nti waliwo kye yali asobola okukola ku nsonga eyo.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
Certainly not!	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri!
I want to know if you are okay baby.	Njagala kumanya oba oli bulungi mwana.
He can do whatever he wants.	Asobola okukola kyonna ky’ayagala.
This is not a good movie.	Eno si firimu nnungi.
The food was good.	Emmere yali nnungi.
I don't really know how to do this though.	Kino mu butuufu simanyi ngeri ya kukikola wadde.
It goes this way.	Kigenda mu ngeri eno.
I don’t know, not being one.	Simanyi, si kubeera omu.
That was a very, very important moment.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kikulu nnyo nnyo.
He couldn’t stay here long.	Yali tasobola kumala wano bbanga ddene.
Something is something is something.	Ekintu kye kintu kye kintu.
That was always important to me.	Ekyo bulijjo kyali kikulu gyendi.
It's up to you.	Kiri gy'oli.
Was he talking about you?	Yali ayogera ku ggwe?
We will buy what we need in the city.	Tujja kugula bye twetaaga mu kibuga.
This is fine as well.	Kino kirungi nga bwe kiri.
He seems like a nice guy.	Alabika nga ggaayi omulungi.
The thing was good.	Ekintu kyali kirungi.
You have to work.	Olina okukola.
You want to be a man.	Oyagala kubeera musajja.
It’s good to go as well.	Kirungi okugenda nga bwe kiri.
I think he would love it.	Ndowooza yandiyagadde nnyo.
I hope someone can help.	Nsuubira waliwo asobola okuyamba.
Give what you would like to receive.	Wa ekyo kye wandyagadde okufuna.
He had none of this.	Yali talina kintu kyonna ku bino.
That’s where we need to be.	Awo we twetaaga okubeera.
He loved the guy.	Yali ayagala nnyo ggaayi oyo.
Perhaps that was exactly what he was.	Oboolyawo ekyo kye yali ddala.
I know you’re afraid.	Nkimanyi nti otya.
It may be true.	Kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
But it could have been anyone.	Naye kyali kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
That’s what was happening in my case.	Ekyo kye kyali kigenda mu maaso mu mbeera yange.
He thought so.	Yalowooza bw’atyo.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Saagala kulaba muntu yenna.
He probably can’t do it.	Oboolyawo tasobola kukikola.
He was from here.	Yali wa wano.
In us.	Ffe mu.
That’s not a problem.	Ekyo si kizibu.
The attitude is not good.	Endowooza si nnungi.
He was my best friend.	Yali mukwano gwange nnyo.
It was the place where it was.	Kyali kifo we kyali.
Probably more than usual.	Oboolyawo okusinga ku bulijjo.
I should have gone now.	Nze wandibadde ngenda kati.
Each of us.	Buli omu ku ffe.
But I don't know what he said.	Kyokka simanyi kye yayogera.
And of course that seems absolutely true.	Era ddala ekyo kirabika nga kituufu ddala.
I couldn’t see very clearly.	Nnali sisobola kulaba bulungi nnyo.
On this view.	Ku ndowooza eno.
He was a good man.	Yali musajja mulungi.
He would do that.	Ekyo yandikoze.
You are not yourself.	Ggwe tewali ggwe kennyini.
I really wonder exactly what he said.	Nze ddala nneebuuza ddala kye yayogera.
I don’t know what they are.	Simanyi kye bali.
There is so much more.	Waliwo bingi nnyo.
He won’t come to my office.	Tajja kujja mu ofiisi yange.
I have no idea about this.	Kino sirina kye mmanyi.
No, there is nothing.	Nedda, tewali kintu kyonna.
That doesn’t matter.	Ekyo si kikulu.
I will go home too.	Nange nja kudda eka.
Where are we going with this?.	Kino tugenda wa?.
I need to make sure everything is right.	Nze nneetaaga okulaba nga buli kimu kituufu.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
You’re sick.	Oli mulwadde.
You don’t have time.	Tolina budde.
I don’t think he did.	Sirowooza nti yakikola.
He seems always sick.	Alabika bulijjo mulwadde.
He was strong.	Yali wa maanyi.
All this .	Bino byonna .
I’m sick of it.	Nze ndi mulwadde.
She is my wife.	Ye mukyala wange.
My friend is in a better place now.	Mukwano gwange ali mu kifo kirungi kati.
I love the job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu.
This is definitely not the case.	Kino mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
But you’ll know in time.	Naye ojja kumanya mu kiseera.
This was going to be difficult.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kizibu.
It is in no way harmful.	Mu ngeri yonna si ya bulabe.
It wasn’t much of an issue for me.	Yali si nsonga nnyo gyendi.
Not for anything.	Si lwa kintu kyonna.
I'm not a child.	Si nze mwana.
He wasn’t that strong.	Yali si wa maanyi bw’atyo.
No luck with that.	Tewali mukisa ku ekyo.
I'll be back soon.	Nja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
Or he thought he had.	Oba yalowooza nti alina.
I need a job.	Omulimu nneetaaga.
He’s going to be a good player.	Agenda kubeera muzannyi mulungi.
It was a situation.	Yali mbeera.
I knew it.	Nali nkimanyi.
He was very lonely.	Yali yekka nnyo.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
This was a serious problem.	Kino kyali kizibu kya maanyi.
I think it will happen soon.	Ndowooza kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono.
He looks very young.	Alabika muto nnyo.
We were going to.	Twali tugenda...
We need a moment.	Twetaaga akaseera.
Maybe he's on here.	Mpozzi ali ku wano.
But he didn't know why.	Naye yali tamanyi lwaki.
No, it’s not the same.	Nedda, si kye kimu.
You are so beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo.
Not much time.	Si budde bungi.
Everything is fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi.
And with him.	Era naye.
You’re sick.	Oli mulwadde.
He had to work long hours.	Yali alina okukola essaawa nnyingi.
It’s there or it’s not.	Kiri awo oba si bwe kiri.
That won’t work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola.
Actually, this is not true.	Mu butuufu, kino si kituufu.
I live here.	Nze mbeera wano.
This was very common.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo nnyo.
And it’s good for them.	Era kirungi gye bali.
I thought he would go.	Nalowooza nti ajja kugenda.
I wanted to respond.	Nnali njagala kuddamu.
Here something would be.	Wano ekintu kyandibadde.
We have to go.	Tulina okugenda.
He doesn’t have a problem.	Talina buzibu.
However, not everyone is.	Kyokka, si buli muntu bw’atyo.
That’s what we’re here for.	Ekyo kye tuli wano.
We have one person in that house.	Tulina omuntu omu mu nnyumba eyo.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
I know that, now.	Ekyo nkimanyi, kati.
Not at all.	N’akatono.
Of course, of course.	Kya lwatu, kya lwatu.
No, he couldn't talk right now.	Nedda, yali tasobola kwogera mu kiseera kino.
This isn’t really a good idea.	Kino mu butuufu si kirowoozo kirungi.
We can do whatever you want.	Tusobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
He already told me no.	Yangamba dda nti nedda.
It was the whole point.	Yali nsonga yonna.
He thought so.	Yalowooza bw’atyo.
It doesn’t matter.	Si kikulu.
It was in the future.	Kyali mu maaso.
Maybe it was worse than that.	Mpozzi nga kyali kibi okusinga ekyo.
But of course you’ll be fine.	Naye ddala ojja kuba bulungi.
This is always important.	Kino bulijjo kikulu.
This is very true, he has a point.	Kino kituufu nnyo, alina ensonga.
But there is no help.	Naye tewali buyambi.
And of course it may or may not be.	Era ddala kiyinza okuba oba nedda.
But not in this case.	Naye si mu mbeera eno.
We are strong.	Tuli ba maanyi.
I’m not sure, of course.	Sikakasa, ddala.
I thought we were friends.	Nnalowooza nti tuli ba mukwano.
And then that’s it.	Era awo ekyo.
That’s what he wanted.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala.
From all of them.	Okuva mu byonna.
You and only you will.	Ggwe era ggwe wekka ojja kukola.
I knew that for a reason.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi lwa nsonga.
Who knows you’re with us.	Ani amanyi nti oli naffe.
That's why this is happening.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso.
I’m feeling better.	Nze mpulira bulungi.
Anything will work.	Ekintu kyonna kijja kukola.
There is nothing we can do.	Tewali kye tusobola kukola.
Or maybe.	Oba mpozzi.
But he had no choice.	Naye yali talina kya kukola.
The financial crisis.	Obuzibu bwa ssente.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
I love to work.	Njagala nnyo okukola.
I loved those things.	Ebintu ebyo nnali njagala nnyo.
The dog needs me.	Embwa yeetaaga nze.
Maybe that was the problem.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
He will have been.	Ajja kuba abadde.
Or at the moment.	Oba mu kiseera kino.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
I don't know.	Simanyi.
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
But that’s what’s going on here.	Naye ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso wano.
I thought that might work.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kiyinza okukola.
It seems to me it is about the same.	Kirabika gyendi kiri ku kimu.
I know everything.	Nze buli kimu nkimanyi.
I have it now.	Nnina kati.
While he was with her.	Nga ali naye.
He was a really nice guy.	Yali ggaayi mulungi ddala.
As of the present time.	Nga mu kiseera kino.
Someone had to do it.	Omuntu yalina okukikola.
But he couldn't talk much.	Naye yali tasobola kwogera nnyo.
In the bottom here.	Mu wansi wano.
But he had his reasons.	Naye yalina ensonga ze.
That’s really my point.	Eyo ddala y’ensonga yange.
Don’t know if that’s a good thing.	Tomanyi oba ekyo kintu kirungi.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
Now, he thought.	Kati, bwe yalowooza.
But he is he is.	Naye ye ye.
Now you know.	Kati omanyi.
He can’t do that.	Ekyo tasobola kukikola.
I can’t say anything yet.	Siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna n’okutuusa kati.
Now it is very dangerous.	Kati kya bulabe nnyo.
I knew it was happening.	Namanya nti kigenda mu maaso.
I don’t know why anyone would have any problem with that.	Simanyi lwaki omuntu yenna yandibadde alina obuzibu bwonna ku ekyo.
Not to me.	Si gyendi.
You are my best friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange asinga.
I knew he knew that too.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi nti naye yali akimanyi.
We have to go now.	Tulina okugenda kati.
That might help.	Ekyo kiyinza okuyamba.
He didn't want to talk.	Yali tayagala kwogera.
Here's the thing though.	Wano ekintu wadde.
What do you think.	Ggwe olowooza ki.
I do this a lot indeed.	Kino nkola nnyo ddala.
He wanted to know what it was.	Yali ayagala okumanya kye kyali.
Now, there’s me.	Kati, waliwo nze.
He felt comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi.
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
He thinks this is very important.	Alowooza nti kino kikulu nnyo.
But it’s not dangerous.	Naye si kya bulabe.
And it’s a sin.	Era kibi.
Actually, that’s where the issue lies.	Mu butuufu, awo we wali ensonga.
No one really wants anyone to know who they really are.	Tewali ayagala ddala muntu yenna kumanya ky’ali ddala.
He is not the point here.	Si ye nsonga wano.
Really? 	Kituufu?
you said.	bwe wagamba.
It was simply what he was doing.	Kyali kyangu nnyo kye yali akola.
He won't come.	Tajja kujja.
You don’t want to get in trouble.	Toyagala kufuna buzibu.
Maybe that was a good thing.	Mpozzi ekyo kyali kirungi.
We need to talk to him as much as we can.	Tulina okwogera naye nga bwe tusobola.
You were young.	Ggwe wali muto.
That’s what I expected too.	Ekyo nange kye nnali nsuubira.
I feel like it’s happening a little bit more each day.	Mpulira nga kigenda mu maaso katono buli lunaku.
But he does well.	Naye akola bulungi.
They were strong guys.	Baali ba ggaayi ba maanyi.
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
He didn’t really know this.	Mu butuufu kino yali tamanyi.
He was a schoolteacher.	Yali musomesa mu ssomero.
But, this is up to you.	Naye, kino kiri gy’oli.
I can’t say anything about that.	Ekyo siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna.
I'm not ready to talk to you yet.	Nze n'okutuusa kati siri mwetegefu kwogera naawe.
You know you’re mine.	Omanyi nti oli wange.
There is no money for them.	Tewali ssente gye bali.
No, no, no, no.	Nedda nedda nedda.
I don’t have anyone.	Sirina muntu yenna.
I didn’t care at all.	Nnali sifaayo n’akatono.
Not so with me.	Si bwe kiri ku nze.
Not that he has much.	Si nti alina bingi.
And he knew so much about so much.	Era yali amanyi bingi nnyo ku bingi nnyo.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo yakikola.
I’m going to work with this.	Ngenda kukola ne kino.
I do have my own car.	Nze ddala nnina mmotoka yange.
I don’t know where it is right now.	Simanyi gye kiri mu kiseera kino.
Maybe that will be you too.	Mpozzi oyo naawe ojja kuba ggwe.
You never know what could happen.	Tomanyi kiyinza kubaawo.
I’m not sure that.	Sikakasa nti.
But nothing could happen.	Naye nga tewali kiyinza kubaawo.
It is normal for them.	Kya bulijjo gye bali.
What power would such an image have.	Ekifaananyi ng’ekyo kyandibadde na maanyi ki.
You can do the same thing.	Naawe osobola okukola ekintu kye kimu.
How much was this food?	Emmere eno yali mmeka?
I wanted him happy.	Nnali njagala musanyufu.
Actually a lot.	Mu butuufu bingi.
It’s not a bad idea.	Si kirowoozo kibi.
Myself as well.	Nze kennyini nga bwe kiri.
You can’t just eat anything.	Tosobola kulya kintu kyonna kyokka.
I don’t know where but there is.	Simanyi wa naye waliwo.
But that’s neither here nor there.	Naye ekyo si wano wadde awo.
I didn’t want to talk.	Nnali saagala kwogera.
Tomorrow, we’ll both be fine.	Enkya, ffembi tujja kuba bulungi.
I’m sure it’s not.	Nkakasa nti si bwe kiri.
Not even this.	Si wadde kino.
I had no plans.	Nnali sirina nteekateeka.
However, this can be difficult to do.	Kyokka kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu okukikola.
But they are .	Naye bali .
And it could be anything.	Era kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
You’ll be fine.	Ojja kuba bulungi.
That’s a lot harder than it sounds.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo okusinga bwe kirabika.
However, it is not really easy.	Kyokka, mu butuufu si kyangu.
I loved that movie.	Firimu eyo nnali njagala nnyo.
I wasn’t very good in school.	Nnali si mulungi nnyo mu ssomero.
I'll move on.	Nja kugenda mu maaso.
Reading is always important.	Okusoma bulijjo kikulu.
I know he is my friend.	Nkimanyi nti mukwano gwange.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
He does really well at his job.	Akola bulungi ddala ku mulimu gwe.
It is very dangerous.	Kya bulabe nnyo.
He was finished.	Yali amaze.
And it won’t happen.	Era tekijja kubaawo.
He says everything will be fine.	Agamba nti buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
His city.	Kibuga kye.
Almost as usual.	Kumpi nga bulijjo.
I want there there.	Njagala awo eyo.
Much like him too.	Bingi nga ye naye.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
I’m working hard towards that right now.	Nkola nnyo okutuuka ku ekyo mu kiseera kino.
That’s how we both are.	Ffembi bwe tuli.
He is here, however, not for long.	Ali wano, naye, si lwa bbanga ddene.
Everyone is fine with me.	Buli omu ali bulungi gyendi.
There was nothing wrong I could do.	Tewali kibi kye nnali nsobola kukola.
No! 	Nedda!
There’s someone here.	Waliwo omuntu wano.
Here it is the same.	Wano kye kimu.
That was the plan.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka.
But that’s the point.	Naye y’ensonga eyo.
I think we were going to be lucky.	Ndowooza twali tugenda kuba ba mukisa.
Obviously, it’s happening.	Kya lwatu nti kigenda mu maaso.
But in this case, it’s probably too close.	Naye mu mbeera eno, osanga kiri kumpi nnyo.
And this is the point.	Era eno y’ensonga.
I'm sure we can do it though.	Nkakasa nti tusobola okukikola wadde.
He was a very nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo.
It goes under nothing.	Kigenda wansi wa kintu kyonna.
I love doing my job.	Njagala nnyo okukola omulimu gwange.
Not so much now.	Si bingi nnyo kati.
Now I’m not ready.	Kati siri mwetegefu.
He is there all the time.	Ali awo buli kiseera.
Just one thing.	Ekintu kimu kyokka.
There is no one here.	Tewali muntu yenna wano.
I think you can do it.	Ndowooza oyinza okukikola.
You don’t want to know why someone did something.	Toyagala kumanya lwaki omuntu yakola ekintu.
Early in the morning	Bukyali ku makya
However, that is not the case.	Kyokka, ekyo si bwe kiri.
I am a medical doctor.	Ndi musawo wa musawo.
It was bad for him.	Kyali kibi ku ye.
Like me.	Nga nze.
But, really, anything would.	Naye, ddala, ekintu kyonna kyandibadde.
My plan is not to have a plan.	Enteekateeka yange si kuba na nteekateeka.
It’s time to move on.	Kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
I certainly hope that is not the case.	Mazima ddala nsuubira nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
I'm not so sure about the good.	Sikakasa nnyo ku kirungi.
Everything, and nothing.	Buli kimu, era tewali kintu kyonna.
He looked good actually.	Yalabika bulungi mu butuufu.
Where are we going?	Tugenda wa?
And he's beautiful.	Era mulungi.
He still hadn’t said anything.	N’okutuusa kati yali tannaba kwogera kintu kyonna.
Want to buy my painting?	Oyagala okugula ekifaananyi kyange?
You work hard all the time.	Okola nnyo buli kiseera.
In fact, they were lucky.	Mu butuufu, baali ba mukisa.
I couldn’t let that happen.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
Would you like this too?.	Naawe wandyagadde kino?.
Everyone was very happy.	Buli omu yali musanyufu nnyo.
Whether everything is going to be okay or not.	Oba buli kimu kigenda kuba bulungi oba nedda.
But more than that.	Naye okusinga ekyo.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
I don’t have anything to do.	Sirina kye nkola.
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
He doesn’t want to talk to me.	Tayagala kwogera nange.
Very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo, kirungi nnyo.
I’m sure he’s working with you.	Nkakasa nti akola naawe.
However, I was kind of interested.	Kyokka nnali mu ngeri ya njagala.
Everyone has to move on.	Buli muntu alina okugenda mu maaso.
We are one mind.	Tuli ndowooza emu.
And it’s not good and it’s not good.	Era si bulungi era si bulungi.
It will be like.	Kijja kuba nga.
But that was bad, he thought.	Naye ekyo kyali kibi, bwe yalowooza.
. . . .	.
Are you ready to go?	Oli mwetegefu okugenda?
No one needed it.	Tewali yali yeetaaga.
I could only imagine the scene.	Nnali nsobola okulowooza ku kifo ekyo.
I can’t tell where, of course.	Sisobola kumanya wa, ddala.
But she is my wife.	Naye ye mukyala wange.
You can, but not me.	Osobola, naye si nze.
What is going on? 	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso?
It’s not good to wait.	Si kirungi kulinda.
You will see in this.	Ojja kulaba mu kino.
Maybe it's bad.	Mpozzi nga kibi.
How does he do this?	Kino akikola atya?
I will love.	Nja kwagala.
He is blessed without us.	Alina omukisa nga tetulina.
It was a beautiful place.	Kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
I’m sorry to say it’s true.	Nsonyiwa okugamba nti mazima.
This is great to see.	Kino kikulu nnyo okulaba.
He wanted to go quickly.	Yali ayagala kugenda mangu.
I can't quite tomorrow.	Sisobola bulungi enkya.
For today, or.	Ku lwa leero, oba.
But it’s very hard to do.	Naye kizibu nnyo okukola.
You have him.	Ggwe olina ye.
Now he saw.	Kati yalaba.
However, it wasn’t.	Kyokka, si bwe kyali.
I won't go.	Sijja kugenda.
I knew that now.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi kati.
He just won’t do it.	Ye kyokka tajja kukikola.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
I’m with you here.	Nze ndi naawe wano.
I think I might be feeling something.	Ndowooza nnyinza okuba nga nnina kye mpulira.
This dog was alone.	Embwa eno yali yekka.
I don’t know why.	Simanyi lwaki.
This was your plan.	Eno ye yali enteekateeka yo.
I am a friend of his friends.	Ndi mukwano gwa mikwano gye.
We are lucky.	Tulina omukisa.
This is not a common practice.	Eno si nkola ya bulijjo.
That he loves it.	Nti ayagala nnyo.
They were definitely best friends back then.	Mazima ddala baali ba mukwano nnyo mu kiseera ekyo.
I couldn’t drive with something like that.	Nnali sisobola kuvuga nga nnina ekintu ng’ekyo.
It’s not as hard as it sounds.	Si kizibu nga bwe kirabika.
I was very busy.	Nnali bbize nnyo.
Now he was going.	Kati yali agenda.
That would be easier and better.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu era nga kirungi.
I don't want to.	Saagala.
I’m going to be fine.	Ngenda kuba bulungi.
The food is on here.	Emmere eri ku wano.
Driving too much.	Okuvuga ennyo.
But it is very hard to read.	Naye kizibu nnyo okusoma.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
He did everything right.	Buli kimu yakikola bulungi.
You don’t have to, but you can’t.	Tolina kukikola, naye tosobola kukikola.
I am happy today.	Ndi musanyufu leero.
She loved everything.	Yali ayagala nnyo buli kimu.
Nothing in front, nothing in return.	Tewali kintu kyonna mu maaso, tewali kintu kyonna mu kuddamu.
He didn’t know where and how serious it was.	Yali tamanyi wa era bwe kyali kya maanyi.
He didn't want to talk.	Yali tayagala kwogera.
And so he is.	Era bwatyo ye.
Sooner than he expected, too.	Amangu ddala okusinga bwe yali asuubira, naye.
He could go to any class he wanted.	Yali asobola okugenda mu kibiina kyonna kye yali ayagala.
The dog was friendly.	Embwa yali ya mukwano.
But it was for good reason.	Naye kyali kya nsonga nnungi.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
He wasn’t going to be there.	Yali tagenda kubeerawo.
He is happy as can be.	Ali musanyufu nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
You will have nothing.	Tojja kuba na kintu kyonna.
Who was he? 	Yali ani?
There's a reason for you.	Waliwo ensonga gy'oli.
And he didn’t know what to do, either.	Era yali tamanyi kya kukola, era.
And he couldn’t.	Era yali tasobola.
The house, of course.	Ennyumba, ddala.
He wasn’t very strong.	Yali si wa maanyi nnyo.
We don’t have much time at all.	Tetulina budde bungi bwonna.
I said he should buy one.	Nagamba nti alina okugula emu.
It was in the air.	Kyali mu bbanga.
I feel scared.	Mpulira nga ntya.
That ' s exactly what it is.	Ekyo ' kye kiri ddala.
I hope you don’t mind.	Nsuubira nti tolina buzibu.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
He came alone.	Yajja yekka.
He couldn’t talk to us.	Yali tasobola kwogera naffe.
It’s happening every day now.	Kigenda mu maaso buli lunaku kati.
I want to know who did this.	Njagala kumanya ani yakola kino.
It’s as good as it gets.	Kirungi nga bwe kiri.
No, it’s not me.	Nedda, si nze.
I thought he was in a great location.	Nalowooza nti yali mu kifo kirungi nnyo.
In practice, we shall see.	Mu nkola, tujja kulaba.
He knew he couldn’t do that.	Yali akimanyi nti ekyo tasobola kukikola.
In the car, driving, it was intense.	Mu mmotoka, okuvuga, kyali kya maanyi.
He always had.	Bulijjo yalina.
I can’t see anything.	Siyinza kulaba kintu kyonna.
He would be on time.	Yandibadde mu budde.
I know you want to go to work.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala kugenda ku mulimu.
I can.	Nsobola.
Everything we have, you should have too.	Buli kye tulina, naawe wandibadde naawe.
You can read from here.	Osobola okusoma okuva wano.
I was very young.	Nnali muto nnyo.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Okakasa nti kino oyagala okukikola?
And so he did.	Era bw’atyo bwe yakola.
It was the same thing now.	Kyali kintu kye kimu kati.
And he would work.	Era yandikoze.
Good luck to you.	Omukisa omulungi.
He looked so lonely.	Yalabika nga yekka nnyo.
I couldn’t eat.	Nnali sisobola kulya.
I can do that better than he can .	Ekyo nsobola okukikola okusinga ye .
He can see so much.	Asobola okulaba bingi nnyo.
What is he doing?	Akola ki?
Or tried to do it.	Oba yagezaako okukikola.
I have been working there.	Mbadde nkola eyo.
This is what he needed.	Kino kye yali yeetaaga.
Like a guy.	Nga ggaayi.
Good, but unusual.	Kirungi, naye nga si kya bulijjo.
And I am happy.	Era ndi musanyufu.
No one there, either.	Tewali muntu yenna eyo, era.
So said swimming.	Bwatyo bwe yagamba okuwuga.
And maybe you are one.	Era mpozzi ggwe oli omu.
It looks really good on her.	Kirabika bulungi ddala ku ye.
You have to do this.	Kino olina okukikola.
You have to come back with me.	Olina okudda nange.
Day.	Olunaku.
I feel so lucky.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa nnyo.
That was true, of course.	Ekyo kyali kituufu, mazima ddala.
Only you know.	Ggwe wekka amanyi.
This thing or that thing I think.	Ekintu kino oba ekintu ekyo ndowooza.
It’s just a very dangerous place.	Kifo kya bulabe nnyo kyokka.
I don't know what the problem is.	Simanyi buzibu ki.
You have to act now.	Olina okukola kati.
That was one thing.	Ekyo kyali kimu.
To see such a thing .	Okulaba ekintu ng'ekyo .
That's what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri ekyo.
It will never happen again.	Tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
I loved the food.	Nnali njagala nnyo emmere.
I need to go fast.	Nze nneetaaga okugenda amangu.
Not that it seems to matter.	Si nti kirabika kikulu.
And now this.	Era kati kino.
What he did was right.	Kye yakola kyali kituufu.
But not for everyone.	Naye si eri buli omu.
Now I’m not going.	Kati sigenda.
Someone will come.	Waliwo ajja kujja.
I don’t even have my own house.	Sirina wadde ennyumba yange.
He is still a man.	Akyali musajja.
A lot of it really.	Bingi ddala.
You want the best person for the job.	Oyagala omuntu asinga ku mulimu.
I said one of us has to do something.	Nagamba nti omu ku ffe alina ky’alina okukola.
No one has it.	Tewali muntu yenna alina.
Or you can do it.	Oba osobola okukola.
This is a beautiful car.	Eno mmotoka nnungi nnyo.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
Make.	Okukola.
He can be with you this afternoon.	Asobola okubeera naawe akawungeezi ka leero.
My father is not happy.	Taata si musanyufu.
And now, that’s okay.	Era kati, ekyo si kibi.
I knew he would.	Nali mmanyi nti ajja kukikola.
Maybe not immediately.	Mpozzi nga si mangu ddala.
He obviously was, or would still be in the hospital.	Kya lwatu yali, oba yandibadde akyali mu ddwaaliro.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He said he couldn't do it himself.	Yagambye nti ye kennyini tasobola kukikola.
But it doesn’t matter now.	Naye si kikulu kati.
We were in a lot of trouble.	Twali mu buzibu bungi.
His friend asked what he knew.	Mukwano gwe yabuuza kye yali amanyi.
He's been good.	Abadde mulungi.
And there is nothing to eat.	Era tewali kya kulya.
We are very well off.	Tuli bulungi nnyo.
That is definitely not the case.	Ekyo mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
I really hope he does well.	Nsuubira ddala nti akola bulungi.
But no one does everything.	Naye tewali akola buli kimu.
That's 'that.	Ekyo 'ekyo.
I don’t want anything.	Sirina kye njagala.
Not for much.	Si lwa bingi.
But even here.	Naye ne wano.
But it seems we are in.	Naye kirabika tuli mu.
It was a process.	Yali nkola.
But of course, it’s not true.	Naye kya lwatu, si kituufu.
And there are so many of them.	Era nga bingi nnyo.
He was doing a lot.	Yali akola bingi.
Obviously it would be.	Kya lwatu nti kyandibadde.
I’ve been here.	Nze mbadde wano.
We are very close friends.	Tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
No one knew where they were.	Tewali yali amanyi gye baali.
I didn’t even know what to say.	Nnali simanyi na kya kwogera.
No one wants someone who is good at everything.	Tewali ayagala muntu mulungi mu buli kimu.
We should probably go.	Oboolyawo tusaanidde okugenda.
But he couldn’t do it himself.	Naye ye kennyini yali tasobola kukikola.
Lots of that here.	Bingi ku ebyo wano.
It’s really easy.	Kituufu kyangu.
And of course he knew it.	Era ddala yali akimanyi.
This is all it is.	Kino kyonna kye kiri.
But no, not really.	Naye nedda, si ddala.
Not to you either.	Si eri ggwe naawe.
This is quick and easy.	Kino kyangu era kyangu.
I don’t know why, really.	Simanyi lwaki, ddala.
I doubt it would be any good.	Nbuusabuusa nti kyandibadde kirungi kyonna.
He is my only friend.	Ye mukwano gwange yekka.
But he has a problem.	Naye alina ekizibu.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
And it was sudden.	Era kyali kya mangu.
He didn’t seem to have it.	Yalabika nga talina.
I didn’t really know what he was doing.	Nze nali simanyi bulungi kye yali akola.
It was probably better this way.	Oboolyawo kyali kirungi mu ngeri eno.
He was strong.	Yali wa maanyi.
He is what we need.	Ye kye twetaaga.
But it’s not mine.	Naye si kyange.
He needs it now.	Yeetaaga kati.
Perhaps that is the reason.	Oboolyawo eyo y’ensonga lwaki.
Really.	Kituufu.
That’s not much of an issue.	Ekyo si nsonga nnyingi.
We have to go tonight.	Tulina okugenda ekiro kino.
He is a doctor here.	Ye musawo wano.
And he was never to see anything positive again.	Era yali talina kuddamu kulaba kintu kyonna nga kirungi.
Don’t go to them.	Togenda gye bali.
This concept is powerful.	Endowooza eno ya maanyi.
Want to see what it’s like?	Oyagala kulaba bwe kiri?
And you have to be transparent.	Era olina okubeera mu lwatu.
There it is.	Eyo waliwo.
Point in point.	Ensonga mu nsonga.
This is just a room.	Kino kisenge kyokka.
No one had anything to say.	Tewali yalina kya kwogera.
I know he knew it.	Nkimanyi nti yali akimanyi.
Now you can do that.	Kati ekyo oyinza okukikola.
I knew what they were.	Nnali mmanyi kye baali.
In this case, none.	Mu mbeera eno, tewali.
That’s a real problem right now.	Ekyo kizibu kya ddala mu kiseera kino.
He was going home.	Yali agenda waka.
I had nothing to fear.	Nze nali sirina kye ntya.
I don’t have it and I never will.	Sirina era sijja kukikola.
So far, he has too.	N’okutuusa kati, naye alina.
He knows exactly why.	Amanyi bulungi ensonga lwaki.
And not in a good way.	Era si mu ngeri nnungi.
I am fine with this.	Kino ndi bulungi.
Not you, obviously.	Si ggwe, kya lwatu.
That was a go-to problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu kya kugenda.
And in trouble.	Era mu buzibu.
He says he won’t go.	Agamba nti tajja kugenda.
It is very accurate.	Kituufu nnyo.
You really can.	Ddala osobola.
You are truly in luck.	Mazima ddala oli mu mukisa.
Perhaps you can think.	Oboolyawo oyinza okulowooza.
That to me is a bad idea.	Ekyo gyendi kirowoozo kibi.
Not when he had made another friend.	Si bwe yali amaze okukola mukwano omulala.
I thought you’d like it.	Nalowooza nti wandyagadde.
I don’t care.	Sifaayo.
There is nothing there.	Tewali kintu kyonna awo.
As you were.	Nga bwe wali.
It was absolutely true.	Kyali kituufu ddala.
He's a teacher here, you know.	Ye musomesa wano, omanyi.
I wasn’t sure it would work.	Nali sikakasa nti kijja kukola.
Is it near here?	Kiri kumpi ne wano?
This house is beautiful.	Ennyumba eno nnungi nnyo.
It’s easy to say.	Kyangu okwogera.
You have to talk to me.	Olina okwogera nange.
That was a really nice room.	Ekyo kyali kisenge kirungi ddala.
He didn’t think it would be enough.	Yali talowooza nti kijja kumala.
I'll try it.	Nja kugezaako.
He didn’t want his money.	Yali tayagala ssente ze.
He always does that.	Bulijjo akola bw’atyo.
So he thought he was good.	Bwatyo yalowooza nti yali mulungi.
It’s actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
You might as well.	Naawe oyinza okuba nga naawe.
But it’s still the same.	Naye nga n’okutuusa kati.
He wanted to be with us.	Yali ayagala okuba naffe.
He got a job.	Yafuna omulimu.
At the time I thought it was fine.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnalowooza nti kyali kirungi.
Or you’re not alone.	Oba si wekka.
No one spoke much.	Tewali yayogera nnyo.
He worked hard.	Yakola nnyo.
Not so easy before.	Si kyangu nnyo emabegako.
Maybe that’s what it is.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kiri.
And you’re here.	Era oli wano.
He had been in danger.	Yali abadde mu bulabe.
You might say that.	Oyinza okugamba nti.
It had to be the same.	Kyalina okuba nga kye kimu.
His brother	Muganda we .
He is not happy.	Si musanyufu.
Effort.	Amaanyi.
Only you can answer that.	Ekyo ggwe wekka asobola okuddamu.
Apparently it isn’t.	Kirabika si bwe kiri.
He will never talk to you again.	Tajja kuddamu kwogera naawe.
Perhaps that was the problem.	Oboolyawo ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
But not here, and not now.	Naye si wano, era si kati.
That's why he's going to do it.	Y'ensonga lwaki agenda kukikola.
On the side.	Ku ludda.
He seems to be fine.	Kirabika ali bulungi.
We need to do this.	Kino twetaaga okukola.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
Work is time.	Omulimu gwe kiseera.
I’m not really going to go.	Sigenda ddala kugenda.
Home to us.	Awaka gye tuli.
Any opinion ?.	Waliwo endowooza yonna ?.
Which is very difficult, indeed.	Ekintu ekizibu ennyo, ddala.
Now he was just trying to be nice.	Kati yali agezaako kubeera mulungi yekka.
He knows you’re coming.	Akimanyi nti ojja.
That person or thing.	Omuntu oba ekintu ekyo.
Today, no one is trying.	Leero, tewali agezaako.
It’s the same for everyone.	Kye kimu eri buli muntu.
That wasn’t the issue.	Ekyo si kye kyali ensonga.
But there is definitely a problem.	Naye ddala waliwo ekizibu.
But we will do it.	Naye tujja kukikola.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
Why would you want that.	Lwaki wandyagadde ekyo.
You want to be.	Gwe oyagala okubeera.
I guess that was me.	Ntebereza nti oyo nnali nze.
That's what he has to do.	Ekyo ky'alina okukola.
And he does so.	Era akola bw’atyo.
This can be very difficult.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
But I can’t.	Naye sisobola.
He can move on.	Asobola okugenda mu maaso.
There’s a cat in my room!	Mu kisenge kyange mulimu embwa!
He knows exactly what he has to do.	Amanyi bulungi ky’alina okukola.
That’s nothing.	Ekyo si kintu kyonna.
It's there.	Kiri awo.
The food was excellent.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
I think he might come back tonight.	Ndowooza ayinza okudda ekiro kino.
He wanted so much for so long.	Yali ayagala bingi nnyo okumala ebbanga ddene.
It was early.	Yali nga bukyali.
He shouldn’t be around me.	Tasaanidde kubeera kumpi nange.
Or it’s bad for you.	Oba kibi gy’oli.
He was a man.	Yali musajja.
He didn’t know if he could do it.	Yali tamanyi oba yali asobola okukikola.
Almost there, now.	Kumpi awo, kati.
I knew you would come.	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kujja.
That’s the reason why.	Eyo y’ensonga lwaki.
He has been very good.	Abadde mulungi nnyo.
He did everything.	Yakola buli kimu.
That was a wonderful time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo.
I know what he wants and what he wants.	Nze mmanyi ky’ayagala ne ky’ayagala.
Nobody wanted to play.	Tewali yali ayagala kuzannya.
, is in a state of .	, eri mu mbeera .
But it won’t stay there.	Naye tekijja kusigala awo.
It was right and wrong.	Kyali kituufu era nga si kituufu.
Actually, it’s pretty simple.	Mu butuufu, kyangu nnyo.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
But you are mine.	Naye ggwe oli wange.
It’s hard to say.	Kizibu okwogera.
I’ll make dinner.	Nja kukola ekyeggulo.
And we have almost no time.	Era kumpi tetulina budde.
I am nothing now.	Nze kati siri kintu kyonna.
I hope he comes back soon.	Nsuubira nti ajja kudda mangu.
That’s not realistic.	Ekyo si kya ddala.
I was thinking about you yesterday.	Nze jjo nali ndowooza ku ggwe.
It would be nice to see him do anything.	Kyandibadde kirungi okulaba ng’akola ekintu kyonna.
You can’t tell.	Tosobola kumanya.
By this time tomorrow, you will know.	Mu kiseera kino enkya, ojja kumanya.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
This is very common.	Kino kya bulijjo nnyo.
She was a busy woman, he knew that.	Yali mukyala bbize, ekyo yali akimanyi.
You have to do it this way.	Olina okukikola mu ngeri eno.
We have a destination.	Tulina we tugenda.
I’ve got one here.	Nze nfunye emu wano.
However, you need to do it immediately.	Kyokka, olina okukikola amangu ddala.
I didn’t know what was going on.	Nnali simanyi kyali kigenda mu maaso.
It’s difficult.	Kizibu.
I can’t believe it.	Siyinza kukkiriza.
There was a moment when nothing seemed to happen.	Waliwo akaseera nga tewali kirabika kigenda mu maaso.
I thought he was very lucky.	Nalowooza nti wa mukisa nnyo.
You were young at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo wali muto.
Soon, he got what he wanted.	Mu bbanga ttono, yafuna kye yali ayagala.
For this approach.	Ku nkola eno.
No one will know about it.	Tewali ajja kumanya ku nsonga eno.
He was ready for that.	Ekyo yali mwetegefu.
Getting time !.	Okufuna obudde !.
He is happy.	Ye musanyufu.
He is not a good man.	Si musajja mulungi.
I doubt anyone will.	Nbuusabuusa nti waliwo ajja kukikola.
Everything seems right.	Buli kimu kirabika kituufu.
That’s certainly what he was .	Ekyo mazima ddala kye yali .
But he knew anyway.	Naye yali amanyi mu ngeri yonna.
We can do it.	Tusobola okukola.
It’s not really about that.	Mu butuufu si nsonga eyo.
He knew what he wanted.	Yali amanyi kye yali ayagala.
You don’t go.	Ggwe togenda.
I can eat anything.	Nsobola okulya ekintu kyonna.
One guy said.	Ggaayi omu bwe yagamba.
What a thing to do baby.	Nga kintu kya kukola mwana.
The thing was, he had no idea if he could.	Ekintu kyali nti, yali talina kirowoozo kyonna oba yali asobola.
I want that right now.	Ekyo njagala mu kiseera kino.
I can’t see normally.	Sisobola kulaba mu ngeri ya bulijjo.
I wanted to do it.	Nnali njagala kukikola.
All right, tomorrow morning.	Kirungi, enkya ku makya.
He had a phone.	Yalina essimu.
It was time for everyone to get to work.	Kyali kiseera buli muntu okutuuka ku mulimu.
Like, really hard.	Nga, ddala kizibu.
Right now.	Kati.
I was all ready to go.	Nze ffenna nnali mwetegefu okugenda.
No one came forward.	Tewali yajja mu maaso.
Very little.	Katono nnyo.
And that’s just the thing.	Era ekyo kye kintu kyokka.
It would be great to see that.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo okulaba ekyo.
However, he could have.	Kyokka, yali asobola okuba nga yakikola.
He may be too young to do so.	Ayinza okuba nga muto nnyo okukikola.
Everyone knew it.	Buli omu yali akimanyi.
Everyone talks about him.	Buli omu ayogera ku ye.
No help from anyone.	Tewali buyambi okuva eri omuntu yenna.
We were safe.	Twali tetulina bulabe.
It was exactly that.	Ddala bwe kyali.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Mpozzi nga kintu kirungi.
Maybe you yourself.	Mpozzi ggwe kennyini.
This was excellent.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
Good to get here.	Kirungi okutuuka wano.
His job is a doctor.	Omulimu gwe musawo.
It looks like money.	Kirabika nga ssente.
As it may be.	Nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
I thought about where I was going.	Nalowooza ku wa gye nnali ngenda.
I won’t preach.	Sijja kubuulira.
And that was true.	Era ekyo kyali kituufu.
He came to live with us.	Yajja okubeera naffe.
Maybe, but not anytime soon.	Mpozzi, naye si mu bbanga ttono.
He knew so much.	Yali amanyi bingi nnyo.
You know it, too.	Naawe okimanyi.
If only he could return to the congregation.	Singa asobola okudda mu kibiina.
We should have gone sooner, he said.	Kyandibadde tugenda mangu, bwe yagambye.
It was a good thing, he thought.	Kyali kintu kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
Only you can speak.	Ggwe wekka asobola okwogera.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
I want to do the right thing.	Njagala kukola kituufu.
It's the same as in her room before.	Kye kimu nga bwe kyali mu kisenge kye emabegako.
He did an excellent job.	Yakola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
In fact, it won’t.	Mu butuufu, tekijja kukikola.
He knew no one.	Tewali gwe yali amanyi.
You don’t have to talk about me.	Tolina kwogera ku nze.
What is the nature of the problem?	Ekizibu kiri mu ngeri ki?
If he does anything.	Singa akola ekintu kyonna.
Of course, we cannot continue as we are.	Kya lwatu nti tetusobola kugenda mu maaso nga bwe tuli.
That's why he was here.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki yali wano.
So he came to live here.	Bwatyo yajja okubeera wano.
This was very powerful.	Kino kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
We have what we need.	Tulina bye twetaaga.
Dad isn’t really with her.	Taata mu butuufu tali naye.
You don’t have to do it either.	Naawe tolina kukikola.
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
And if they were.	Era singa baali.
We don’t have a child.	Tetulina mwana.
I don’t want to do anything to it.	Saagala kukikola kintu kyonna.
I’m a singer.	Nze ndi muyimbi.
He's so beautiful.	Mulungi bw'atyo.
And it doesn’t matter.	Era si kikulu.
He wasn’t done with me yet.	Yali tannaba kumala nange.
But please.	Naye nsaba.
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
He wasn’t good.	Yali si mulungi.
You know you will.	Omanyi nti ojja kukikola.
I guess we need to talk about this.	Ntebereza nti kino twetaaga okwogera ku nsonga eno.
The whole arrangement.	Enteekateeka yonna.
And nothing can.	Era tewali kiyinza.
He is talking about us.	Ayogera ku ffe.
I knew where it was going very early in the film.	Namanya gye kyali kigenda nga bukyali nnyo mu firimu.
No, he was a man.	Nedda, yali musajja.
No one was really talking about it.	Tewali yali ayogera ddala ku nsonga eyo.
Indeed, it is.	Mazima ddala, bwe kiri.
But there it is.	Naye awo we kiri.
But he has.	Naye alina...
He knew everything.	Yali amanyi buli kimu.
I love where we are.	Njagala nnyo we tuli.
He was ready to go.	Yali mwetegefu okugenda.
I didn’t know exactly.	Nnali simanyi bulungi.
No one will do it.	Tewali ajja kukikola.
We can’t exist.	Tetusobola kubeerawo.
He says he won’t.	Agamba nti tajja kukikola.
Soon, very soon.	Mu bbanga ttono, mu bbanga ttono nnyo.
Getting stronger every day, though.	Okufuna amaanyi buli lunaku, kyokka.
That alone is not good.	Ekyo kyokka si kirungi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
But that was normal.	Naye ekyo kyali kya bulijjo.
And of course, when.	Era ddala, nga...
No one is working.	Tewali muntu yenna akola.
That was sudden.	Ekyo kyali kya mangu.
I don’t like it anymore.	Nze sikyagala.
He did absolutely.	Yakikola ddala.
He has to go home, though.	Alina okudda eka, wadde.
That's him.	Oyo ye.
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
I have things to do.	Nnina ebintu bye nnina okukola.
Now you can get back to work.	Kati oyinza okudda ku mulimu.
This watch belonged to my father.	Essaawa eno yali ya taata.
No one believed this idea.	Tewali muntu yenna yakkiriza ndowooza eno.
He fell asleep.	Yeebase.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
You are lucky to work with him.	Oli wa mukisa okukola naye.
No child is sick.	Tewali mwana mulwadde.
No I won’t say that.	Nedda sijja kwogera ekyo.
Or someone might.	Oba omuntu ayinza.
I was basically indifferent to the conceptual work.	Okusinga nnali sifaayo ku mulimu gwa ndowooza.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I have another job.	Nnina omulimu omulala gwe nnina.
I think it would be better if no one.	Ndowooza kyandibadde kirungi singa tewali muntu yenna.
But I can't find anything about it.	Naye sisobola kufuna kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
We’re not the only ones.	Si ffe ffekka.
, '.	, '.
And the guys.	Ne ba ggaayi.
He was well aware of this.	Kino yali akimanyi bulungi.
It’s just that.	Kye kyokka.
Here and here.	Wano ne wano.
Nothing can happen.	Tewali kiyinza kubaawo.
I don’t have any children.	Sirina mwana yenna.
One by one.	Omu ku omu.
Even you and I.	Wadde ggwe nze.
I want to move on.	Njagala okugenda mu maaso.
I wasn’t home.	Nze nali siri waka.
I knew how to work there.	Nali mmanyi okukola eyo.
I am strong in my own way.	Ndi wa maanyi mu ngeri yange.
The same thing, of course.	Ekintu kye kimu, ddala.
Hours, he thought.	Ssaawa, bwe yalowooza.
He was coming.	Yali ajja.
He was an only child.	Yali mwana yekka.
That was good for me.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
It’s hard to see.	Kizibu okulaba.
I don’t want it here.	Saagala wano.
This he could do, this he had to do.	Kino yali asobola okukola, kino yalina okukola.
It’s not a policy.	Si nkola.
That's why we're here.	Y'ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
Not even for a moment.	Si wadde okumala akaseera katono.
It’s true and you know it.	Kituufu era okimanyi.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
I love your opinion.	Njagala nnyo endowooza yo.
But this is not the case now.	Naye kino si bwe kiri kati.
No one knew exactly what was going to happen.	Tewali yali amanyi bulungi kyali kigenda kubaawo.
Maybe he can.	Mpozzi asobola.
Not for long now.	Si okumala ebbanga ddene kati.
I can’t stay home today.	Leero sisobola kusigala waka.
I know that he is.	Nkimanyi nti ye.
But there it was.	Naye awo we kyali.
He obviously has trouble reading.	Kya lwatu nti alina obuzibu okusoma.
How could you anyway.	Oyinza otya mu ngeri yonna.
Or so everyone thought.	Oba buli omu bwe yalowooza.
From this position.	Okuva mu kifo kino.
He needed to get to the hospital.	Yali yeetaaga okutuuka mu ddwaaliro.
This is where he wanted to be.	Wano we yali ayagala okubeera.
I’m not really here.	Mu butuufu siri wano.
I really don’t know what to say.	Mu butuufu simanyi kya kwogera.
I want the same for my son.	Njagala kye kimu ku mwana wange.
I will be in the front.	Nja kuba mu maaso.
He knew he couldn’t do it, and neither can you.	Yali akimanyi nti tasobola kukikola, era naawe osobola.
I am sick.	Ndi mulwadde.
But he's on to something.	Naye ali ku kintu.
He will come to me.	Ajja kujja gyendi.
I knew he came forward.	Namanya nti yajja mu maaso.
I think you are too young to work here!	Ndowooza oli muto nnyo okukola wano!
I don’t want to have to live.	Saagala kuba na kubeera.
You are so good to us.	Oli mulungi nnyo gye tuli.
But it was intense and powerful.	Naye kyali kya maanyi nnyo era nga kya maanyi nnyo.
And you are beautiful.	Era oli mulungi.
It was a form of city.	Yali ngeri ya kibuga.
I just have to talk to him.	Nnina okwogera naye nzekka.
There really is no way it can happen.	Mazima ddala tewali ngeri gye kiyinza kubaawo.
And of course he had help.	Era ddala yalina obuyambi.
I actually feel strong.	Mu butuufu mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi.
That was something.	Ekyo kyali kintu.
That’s really good.	Ekyo kirungi ddala.
But nothing like this.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna nga kino.
Like you, beautiful.	Nga ggwe, omulungi.
But we can’t stay in this situation.	Naye tetusobola kusigala mu mbeera eno.
I thought that’s what he was going to do.	Nalowooza nti ekyo kye yali agenda okukola.
There is nothing for us there.	Tewali kintu kyonna gye tuli eyo.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ye mukyala mulungi.
But he had his duty to them.	Naye yalina omulimu gwe gye bali.
However, it doesn’t seem quite as simple as that.	Kyokka, kirabika si kyangu nnyo ng’ekyo.
You have to do those things.	Ebintu ebyo olina okukola.
It was a beautiful city.	Kyali kibuga kirungi nnyo.
Right now.	Kati.
I have no plans for that.	Ekyo sirina nteekateeka yonna.
We probably will this afternoon.	Oboolyawo tujja kukola akawungeezi ka leero.
We have to think for a moment.	Tulina okulowooza akaseera katono.
He was looking forward to getting home.	Yali asuubira nnyo okutuuka awaka.
We are not alone and we are not alone.	Si ffe ffekka era si ffekka.
He would like nothing more.	Tewali kye yandiyagadde okusinga ekyo.
He didn’t want trouble.	Yali tayagala buzibu.
I’m sorry, but .	Nsonyiwa, naye .
He said he did maybe.	Yagambye nti yakikola mpozzi.
From this .	Okuva mu kino .
That is very dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe nnyo.
He knew that now.	Ekyo yali akimanyi kati.
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
That was a very good point.	Eyo yali nsonga nnungi nnyo.
It is now on.	Kati kiri ku...
But, that won’t be enough.	Naye, ekyo tekijja kumala.
I am in the real.	Nze ndi mu ddala.
And with him.	Era naye.
You should have known better.	Wandibadde omanyi bulungi.
You know best.	Ggwe asinga okumanya.
And yet, it is very much the same.	Era naye, kye kimu nnyo.
I think that’s true.	Ndowooza ekyo kituufu.
I was sick.	Nnali mulwadde.
His problem was that he lived alone.	Ekizibu kye yali abeera yekka.
But of course, it’s not.	Naye kya lwatu, si bwe kiri.
The problem is, they’re not.	Obuzibu buli nti, si bwe bali.
I’m sure it will happen.	Nkakasa nti kijja kubaawo.
Would love this house.	Ennyumba eno yandiyagadde nnyo.
No one does, really.	Tewali akola, ddala.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
And you can’t know the truth.	Era tosobola kumanya mazima.
I don’t know for sure, and you certainly don’t.	Simanyi bulungi, era mazima ddala tomanyi.
You need to talk to me about it.	Olina okwogera nange ku nsonga eyo.
And it’s powerful.	Era nga kya maanyi.
To do that.	Okukola ekyo.
It doesn’t matter who you are.	Si kikulu ggwe ani.
In fact, he didn’t really know very much.	Mu butuufu, mu butuufu yali tamanyi bingi nnyo.
Which he thought he did.	Kye yali alowooza nti yakikola.
At the same time.	Mu kiseera kye kimu.
It was a very important thing.	Kyali kikulu nnyo.
You said you could.	Wagamba nti osobola.
That’s completely up to you.	Ekyo kiri gyoli ddala.
He knew he could say no.	Yali akimanyi nti asobola okugamba nti nedda.
It’s actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
I know this is true.	Nkimanyi nti kino kituufu.
What, he didn't know.	Kiki, yali tamanyi.
And he said he wasn’t alone.	Era yagamba nti si ye yekka.
I know that we can.	Nkimanyi nti tusobola.
Now that they were together he didn't know what to do.	Kati bwe baali bombi yali tamanyi kya kukola.
And he is my friend.	Era ye mukwano gwange.
And this is what is happening here.	Era kino kye kiri wano.
Indeed, they are.	Ddala, bwe bali.
That is very dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe nnyo.
It’s important to us.	Kikulu gye tuli.
He looked very, very happy.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo nnyo.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
It’s mine, you know.	Kye kyange, omanyi.
So far, so good.	N’okutuusa kati, kirungi nnyo.
I don’t like it here.	Wano sikyagala.
It’s hard to see.	Kizibu okulaba.
He really wanted to go, but he couldn’t.	Yali ayagala nnyo okugenda, naye nga tasobola.
And yet, here we are.	Era naye, wano we tuli.
That’s right, that’s right.	Ekyo kituufu, ekyo kituufu.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Simanyi kya kukola, ddala.
He is here right now.	Ali wano mu kiseera kino.
You are real and here I am.	Oli ddala era wano nange.
He seems very happy now.	Alabika musanyufu nnyo kati.
We must not allow this to happen!	Kino tetulina kukkiriza kubaawo!
Now he knew that was not the case.	Kati yali akimanyi nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
Who and where, how and why, when and what.	Ani ne wa, atya era lwaki, ddi era kiki.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
I'll just accept anything.	Nja kumala kukkiriza kintu kyonna.
I'll be back tomorrow.	Nja kudda enkya.
He was already doing very well.	Yali yakola dda bulungi nnyo.
The whole arrangement.	Enteekateeka yonna.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
No one knows where he went.	Tewali amanyi gye yagenda.
What he was on.	Kye yali ku.
I’ll be fine until morning.	Nja kuba bulungi okutuusa ku makya.
No, you don’t have to do everything yourself.	Nedda, tolina kukola buli kimu wekka.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Simanyi kigenda kubaawo.
Not good for that.	Si kirungi ku ekyo.
How dangerous for them as it is for me.	Nga kya bulabe gye bali nga bwe kiri ku nze.
I'm praying a lot.	Nsaba nnyo.
I will get one soon.	Nja kufuna emu mu bbanga ttono.
That’s not quite right now.	Ekyo si kituufu nnyo kati.
This seems to be true.	Kino kirabika nga kituufu.
We are.	Ffe tuli.
His attitude was almost too strong.	Endowooza ye kumpi yali ya maanyi nnyo.
A little while ago.	Akaseera katono emabega.
However, not on this.	Kyokka si ku kino.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera.
I love dogs.	Njagala nnyo embwa.
It looks like a real person.	Kirabika muntu ddala.
But maybe that's just me.	Naye mpozzi oyo nze nzekka.
Mostly my girlfriend now.	Okusinga muganzi wange kati.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
You don’t have to do this.	Kino tolina kukikola.
However, this is not the case with man.	Kyokka kino si bwe kiri eri omuntu.
He did very well .	Yakola bulungi nnyo .
He had his plan.	Yalina enteekateeka ye.
She was beautiful and beautiful.	Yali mulungi era nga mulungi.
It is, and yet it is not.	Kiri, era naye si bwe kiri.
I know exactly.	Nze mmanyi bulungi.
My wife does this here.	Mukyala wange kino akikola wano.
But he is a very good teacher.	Naye musomesa mulungi nnyo.
I really don’t know what to do.	Mazima ddala simanyi kya kukola.
Not a bad idea though.	Si kirowoozo kibi wadde.
This is my practice.	Kino kye nkola yange.
From the moment he asked, he was willing to consider the idea.	Okuva lwe yabuuza, yali mwetegefu okulowooza ku ndowooza eyo.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
I guess it’s not.	Ntebereza nti si bwe kiri.
I love reading about it.	Njagala nnyo okusoma ku nsonga eyo.
Until late in the evening.	Okutuusa akawungeezi ennyo.
I feel that he is very good.	Mpulira nti mulungi nnyo.
Why does he do this?	Lwaki kino akikola?
It’s really very difficult.	Ddala kizibu nnyo.
Are you sure?.	Okakasa?.
For a while, that’s all.	Okumala akaseera, ekyo kyokka.
Not really, he said.	Si ddala, bwe yagambye.
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
And the help he did.	Era obuyambi bwe yakola.
My brother saw how they were.	Muganda wange yalaba bwe baali.
I love doing this.	Kino njagala nnyo okukikola.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
I loved that one.	Nnali njagala nnyo eyo.
What does he want from us?	Ayagala ki okuva gye tuli?
Before he did, he was on her.	Nga tannaba kukola, yali ku ye.
I know how busy you are.	Nze mmanyi engeri gy’oli bbize.
He is the only child.	Ye mwana yekka.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
I am very happy.	Nze ndi musanyufu nnyo.
However, there are limitations to this approach.	Kyokka waliwo obuzibu mu nkola eno.
I can’t wait to see what it is.	Siyinza kulinda kulaba kye kiri.
There are problems, of course.	Waliwo obuzibu, ddala.
My food was excellent.	Emmere yange yali nnungi nnyo.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
And you probably will.	Era oboolyawo ojja kukikola.
No artist is going to do that.	Tewali muyimbi agenda kukola ekyo.
Whatever it is.	Kyonna kye kiri.
Nothing matters now.	Tewali kikulu kati.
They are, of course.	Bali, ddala.
On my watch.	Ku ssaawa yange.
Good job, my son.	Omulimu mulungi mwana wange.
Hope is a wonderful thing.	Essuubi kintu kirungi nnyo.
It was with him.	Kyali naye.
As simple as that.	Nga kyangu nga ekyo.
He was a man now.	Yali musajja kati.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Naye si kibi.
I want you too.	Njagala naawe nange.
What he got.	Kye yafuna.
He did it.	Yakikola.
No one wants to talk about getting it though.	Tewali ayagala kwogera ku kufuna wadde.
This is the truth.	Kino kye kituufu.
This is a bad idea.	Kino kirowoozo kibi.
We can go back further than that.	Tusobola okudda emabega okusinga ekyo.
You.	Ggwe.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
I thought you should know.	Nze nalowooza nti olina okumanya.
But one thing.	Naye ekintu kimu.
He knew that she knew.	Yali akimanyi nti yali akimanyi.
But we can do this.	Naye kino tusobola okukikola.
I wondered what he was thinking.	Nneebuuza kye yali alowooza.
There is a plan.	Waliwo enteekateeka.
He loved the view from here.	Yali ayagala nnyo okulaba okuva wano.
I know he did it.	Nkimanyi nti yakikola.
He wants to play.	Ayagala kuzannya.
Or perhaps he couldn’t.	Oba oboolyawo yali tasobola.
He works hard every day.	Akola nnyo buli lunaku.
That’s what he was trying to do.	Ekyo kye yali agezaako okukola.
. . . .	.
And he knows it too.	Era naye akimanyi.
I will have to go to work.	Nja kuba nnina okugenda ku mulimu.
But it’s not about being alone.	Naye si kya kubeera wekka.
I have experienced the same thing myself.	Nze kennyini nfunye ekintu kye kimu.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
You don’t even know how it is for me.	Tomanyi na bwe kiri gyendi.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
I do think you're on to something though.	Nze ndowooza nti oli ku kintu wadde.
Both, he thought.	Bombi, bwe yalowooza nti.
I need to get a job.	Nze nneetaaga okufuna omulimu.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
It may be.	Kiyinza okuba.
Everyone knew where we were coming and when.	Buli omu yali amanyi gye twali tujja ne ddi lwe twali tujja.
He knows that all too well.	Ekyo akimanyi bulungi nnyo.
Maybe it’s him .	Mpozzi nga ye .
We go to school in the morning.	Tugenda ku ssomero ku makya.
Why, it doesn’t matter.	Lwaki, si kikulu.
He doesn’t have to talk to you every day.	Talina kwogera naawe buli lunaku.
He couldn’t have been nicer.	Yali tayinza kuba mulungi okusinga ekyo.
I am.	Nze ndi.
He didn’t seem to be.	Yalabika nga si bw’atyo.
He will not allow it to happen again.	Tajja kukkiriza kuddamu kubaawo.
And here he was.	Era wano we yali.
Like me, he wants to.	Nga nze naye ayagala.
And actually maybe that’s the problem.	Era mu butuufu mpozzi ekyo kye kizibu.
He was very good at what he did, he knew.	Yali mulungi nnyo mu bye yakola, yali akimanyi.
At the moment where it is you know.	Mu kiseera kino we kiri omanyi.
That's right, that's right.	Kituufu, kituufu.
I wonder why.	Nze nneebuuza lwaki.
Mostly out of time.	Okusinga okuva mu budde.
But he was happy.	Naye yali musanyufu.
And he is very beautiful.	Era mulungi nnyo.
I thought I was the only one.	Nalowooza nti nze nzekka.
I can never be.	Siyinza n’akatono okuba.
That was very powerful.	Ekyo kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
It is a very good organization.	Kibiina kirungi nnyo.
Me too, actually.	Nze nange, mu butuufu.
Picture.	Ekifaananyi.
I wish you had.	Njagala nnyo okuba nga olina.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
Not from me.	Si okuva gyendi.
We are in trouble.	Tuli mu buzibu.
And then it will just keep going.	Era awo kijja kumala kugenda mu maaso.
I am very happy to be here.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano.
He thought hard about his issues.	Yalowooza nnyo ku nsonga ze.
He wasn’t happy there.	Yali si musanyufu eyo.
It was him.	Yali ye.
It was a rough night to say the least.	Ekiro kyali kizibu nnyo okugamba nti.
Neither can his wife.	Ne mukyala we tasobola.
It’s not being.	Si kubeera.
It’s a work thing.	Kintu kya mulimu.
He couldn’t do that.	Ekyo yali tayinza kukikola.
And even then.	Era ne mu kiseera ekyo.
Or he started working.	Oba yatandika okukola.
You can’t be .	Tosobola kuba .
He started talking to me too.	Nange yatandika okwogera nange.
From us to you.	Okuva ku ffe okutuuka gy’oli.
And that’s good for them.	Era ekyo kirungi gye bali.
Now, it’s here.	Kati, kiri wano.
He wanted to stay.	Yali ayagala kusigala.
He thought he was lucky.	Yalowooza nti alina omukisa.
But nothing serious.	Naye tewali kintu kya maanyi.
It may be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
And he said, you are the one.	N’agamba nti, ggwe oyo.
Work, work.	Omulimu, omulimu.
I’m not going to talk to my father.	Sigenda kwogera ne taata.
This is a lot you need to know.	Bino bingi olina okumanya.
He was her best friend.	Yali mukwano gwe ennyo.
You were me.	Ggwe wali nze.
Not everyone can get everything they want.	Si buli muntu nti asobola okufuna buli kimu ky’ayagala.
I was feeling good.	Nnali mpulira bulungi.
Now he knew why.	Kati yali amanyi lwaki.
Maybe, just maybe, this might work.	Mpozzi, mpozzi kyokka, kino kiyinza okukola.
But of course, as it is.	Naye ddala, nga bwe kiri.
All of them are.	Byonna bye.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
He knew she was beautiful.	Yali akimanyi nti mulungi nnyo.
I certainly wonder this.	Mazima ddala kino nneebuuza.
It was a good thing.	Kyali kintu kirungi.
I'm there too.	Nange ndi awo.
Apparently up to.	Kirabika okutuuka ku...
But he was.	Naye yali.
Good baby, good .	Kirungi mwana, kirungi .
I don't know exactly.	Nze simanyi bulungi.
He is happy with me.	Musanyufu nange.
She was really nice.	Ddala yali mulungi nnyo.
I’m not quite ready.	Nze siri mwetegefu nnyo.
I'm glad you have money.	Ndi musanyufu nti olina ssente.
He was practical.	Yali wa nkola.
It’s very, very simple.	Kyangu nnyo nnyo.
Food is coming very quickly.	Emmere ejja mangu nnyo.
However, even here.	Kyokka ne wano.
But he may not have it.	Naye ayinza okuba nga talina.
That was what it was? 	Ekyo kye kyali?
I was obviously nervous.	Kya lwatu nti nnali ntya.
He couldn’t tell.	Yali tasobola kumanya.
I really have to think.	Ddala nnina okulowooza.
So did everyone else.	Bw’atyo buli muntu bwe yakola.
This is not my point.	Eno si y’ensonga yange.
But he could talk.	Naye yali asobola okwogera.
Such a picture.	Ekifaananyi ng’ekyo.
Or rather than that.	Oba okusinga ekyo.
In this city.	Mu kibuga kino.
You’re not either.	Naawe si ggwe.
He is with me.	Ali nange.
Was he really talking about himself?	Ddala yali ayogera ku ye kennyini?
I know it belonged to him.	Nkimanyi nti yali wa ye.
He was a happy man.	Yali musajja musanyufu.
In fact, this is what he wants.	Mu butuufu kino ky’ayagala.
I think that.	Nze ndowooza nti.
He was in a short distance.	Yali mu bbanga ttono.
I have so much to do.	Nnina bingi nnyo bye nnina okukola.
Everyone was talking to us.	Buli omu yali ayogera naffe.
We are moving forward.	Tugenda mu maaso.
He has a.	Alina e...
He can, of course.	Asobola, ddala.
He has to come back tomorrow.	Alina okudda enkya.
You can’t do that.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola.
But that’s a matter of luck.	Naye eyo nsonga ya mukisa.
Everyone, except me.	Buli muntu, okuggyako nze.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
On the day.	Ku lunaku.
Thinking alone.	Okulowooza yekka.
That is very important to us.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
You have a plan.	Olina enteekateeka.
Good job!	Omulimu mulungi!
Of course, he was working.	Kya lwatu nti yali akola.
But soon he will speak.	Naye mu bbanga ttono ajja kwogera.
I have a picture of my father, but that is it.	Nnina ekifaananyi kya taata naye ekyo kye kiri.
Can you swim?	Osobola okuwuga?
That's what.	Ekyo kye ki...
But it will come.	Naye kijja kujja.
There you are.	Eyo gy’oli.
He says it’s easy to do.	Agamba nti kyangu okukola.
He started working.	Yatandika okukola.
I really like that guy.	Njagala nnyo ggaayi oyo.
I’m not going anywhere.	Sirina gye ngenda.
And then, it’s not good.	Era awo, si kirungi.
You are so lucky.	Oli wa mukisa nnyo.
But yes, he is also a musician.	Naye ye, era muyimbi.
I really knew it.	Nze ddala nnali nkimanyi.
I thought he was a good man.	Nnali ndowooza nti musajja mulungi.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Nnali simanyi ngeri ya kukikola.
He lives downstairs.	Abeera wansi mu kisenge.
None of this will be easy.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kijja kuba kyangu.
And that was really the whole point.	Era mu butuufu eyo ye yali ensonga yonna.
As it was this.	Nga bwe kyali kino.
You should read his book.	Olina okusoma ekitabo kye.
I’m my own problem.	Nze ekizibu kyange.
It was a party house.	Yali nnyumba ya mbaga.
I know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi.
He said he would like that.	Yagambye nti ekyo yandiyagadde.
And it was just sudden.	Era kyali kya mangu kyokka.
This is what it was going to be.	Kino kye kyali kigenda okubeera.
He's doing fine, no problem with that.	Akola bulungi, tewali buzibu na ekyo.
Maybe he shouldn’t.	Mpozzi nga tasaanidde kukikola.
I'm going to.	Nze ngenda ku...
It’s an everyday thing.	Kintu kya buli lunaku.
I'll just say that again.	Ekyo nja kuddamu okwogera kyokka.
Now, we have to do it this way.	Kati, tulina okukikola mu ngeri eno.
I want to speak very clearly.	Njagala okwogera obulungi ennyo.
He would do anything.	Yandikoze ekintu kyonna.
But not everyone is on his side.	Naye si buli muntu nti ali ku ludda lwe.
He couldn't believe what was happening.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza kyali kigenda mu maaso.
But he did it anyway.	Naye yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
He had him.	Yalina ye.
Or who he was.	Oba ani gwe yali.
It is my way or no way.	Ye ngeri yange oba tewali ngeri.
He really should have done.	Ddala yandibadde akola.
But not so much as it is.	Naye si nnyo nga bwe kiri.
No one would have to know.	Tewali yandibadde alina kumanya.
I think it will be good.	Ndowooza kijja kuba kirungi.
I wanted to go home.	Nnali njagala kudda waka.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
Everything was in perfect condition.	Buli kimu kyali mu mbeera nnungi.
I knew this was it.	Namanya nti kino kye kyali.
We’re all here now.	Ffenna tuli wano kati.
One phone call.	Essimu emu.
I wonder if this is good.	Nze nneebuuza oba kino kirungi.
In any case,	Mu ngeri yonna, .
He will be.	Ajja kuba.
This does not seem to be such a thing.	Kino kirabika si kintu ng’ekyo.
That was definitely true for me.	Ekyo mazima ddala kyali kituufu gyendi.
He has been very interested.	Abadde ayagala nnyo.
He was more than just himself.	Yali asinga ku ye yekka.
But it’s there.	Naye kiri awo.
Though there isn’t much here.	Wadde nga wano tewali nnyo.
He can’t stay.	Tasobola kusigala.
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kintu kirungi.
But it was pretty cool.	Naye kyali kirungi nnyo.
I don’t want this.	Kino saagala.
I have to get to.	Nnina okutuuka ku...
You find the time.	Osanga obudde.
This is the same thing.	Kino kye kimu.
What you wanted to do.	Kye wali oyagala okukola.
But that’s not really the point here.	Naye eyo mu butuufu si y’ensonga wano.
I love the picture below.	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi wansi.
I will be with you.	Nja kubeera naawe.
We needed to talk.	Twali twetaaga okwogera.
But he didn’t need to.	Naye yali teyeetaaga.
I don’t know who it is.	Simanyi ani.
He said it wasn’t.	Yagambye nti si bwe kiri.
But that is not uncommon.	Naye ekyo si kya bulijjo.
That could be me.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga nze.
I love it so much.	Nze njagala nnyo.
He knew what he would do.	Yali amanyi kye yandikoze.
Of that he could not or would say nothing.	Ku ekyo yali tasobola oba tayinza kwogera kintu kyonna.
Now, he thought.	Kati, bwe yalowooza.
Or rather than that.	Oba okusinga ekyo.
Maybe not always.	Mpozzi si bulijjo.
You have no strength.	Tolina maanyi.
He certainly looked strong.	Mazima ddala yali alabika nga wa maanyi.
He hasn't come for a long time.	Amaze ebbanga nga tajja.
No, no, no, no.	Nedda, nedda, nedda.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
I have an opinion on that.	Nnina endowooza ku nsonga eyo.
I’ve always been a troubled child.	Bulijjo mbadde mwana alina obuzibu.
The movie was actually really good.	Mu butuufu firimu yali nnungi ddala.
I think he’ll be here soon.	Ndowooza ajja kubeera wano mu bbanga ttono.
Or a plan.	Oba enteekateeka.
It would be easier if they were.	Kyandibadde kyangu singa baali.
Or he does but he doesn’t want to.	Oba akola naye nga tayagala.
He was very dangerous.	Yali wa bulabe nnyo.
You knew he would.	Obadde okimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
In a sense he is.	Mu ngeri emu ali.
He was a very knowledgeable teacher.	Yali musomesa alina okumanya ennyo.
Everything goes downhill.	Buli kimu kigenda wansi.
There seems to be no immediate plan.	Kirabika tewali nteekateeka ya mangu.
This picture is very complicated.	Ekifaananyi kino kizibu nnyo.
This was a fact.	Kino kyali kituufu.
It was the same thing.	Kyali kintu kye kimu.
They are in trouble.	Bali mu buzibu.
He wanted to have a father.	Yali ayagala okufuna taata.
It was a powerful one.	Kyali kya maanyi.
I can’t stay.	Sisobola kusigala.
I certainly am.	Mazima ddala ndi.
That’s where we are.	Awo we tuli.
We are in a difficult place.	Tuli mu kifo kizibu.
I hope that’s not true.	Nsuubira nti ekyo si kituufu.
Or a car?.	Oba mmotoka?.
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
Good for him.	Kirungi ku ye.
You can continue in.	Osobola okugenda mu maaso mu.
You will be mine.	Ggwe ojja kuba wange.
And he started with nothing.	Era yatandika nga talina ky’alina.
But there is.	Naye waliwo.
More than himself, perhaps.	Okusinga ye kennyini, mpozzi.
I don't know what he is.	Nze simanyi ky'ali.
It’s hard to beat in every aspect.	Kizibu okukuba mu buli nsonga.
He hadn’t agreed to anything yet.	Yali tannaba kukkiriza kintu kyonna.
Things like that.	Ebintu nga ebyo.
What?.	Kiki?.
Or if he would like to.	Oba oba yandiyagadde.
I don’t want to stay here.	Saagala kusigala wano.
I’m sure that was true.	Nkakasa nti ekyo kyali kituufu.
And it comes and goes very quickly.	Era kijja ne kigenda mangu nnyo.
I don’t even have to be good right now.	Sirina wadde okubeera omulungi mu kiseera kino.
I'll be there in an hour.	Nja kubeerawo mu ssaawa emu.
I'll wait downstairs.	Nja kulinda wansi.
I'm not sure what's going on here.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso wano.
He would like that, he said.	Ekyo yandiyagadde, bwe yagambye.
And they were .	Era baali .
So did the other guy.	Bw’atyo ne ggaayi omulala.
But he did it anyway.	Naye yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
Now, it’s time to do it.	Kati, kye kiseera okukikola.
It certainly would be.	Mazima ddala kyandibadde.
Unusual.	Si kya bulijjo.
This is going to be very difficult.	Kino kigenda kuba kizibu nnyo.
I'm really, really sorry.	Nze ddala, ddala nsonyiwa.
This is not a no for us.	Kino si nedda gye tuli.
He knew he had to act quickly.	Yali akimanyi nti alina okukola amangu.
He worked hard and hard.	Yakola nnyo era nga yakola nnyo.
I’ve been terrified.	Nze mbadde ntya nnyo.
I think that was the problem.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
Nobody wants it, nobody wants it.	Tewali muntu ayagala, tewali muntu ayagala.
Not that that matters now.	Si nti ekyo kikulu kati.
He is very beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo.
Even among his friends.	Ne mu mikwano gye.
And we are the same.	Era naffe tuli kye kimu.
We're going.	Tugenda.
This program requires a lot of money.	Enteekateeka eno yeetaaga ssente nnyingi.
That’s what we are to them.	Ekyo kye tuli gye bali.
It won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo.
You will see how it looks in this movie.	Ojja kulaba engeri gye kirabika mu firimu eno.
I’m not going to do anything wrong.	Sigenda kukola kibi kyonna.
Here, in this room.	Wano, mu kisenge kino.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
He is always on time.	Bulijjo abeera mu budde.
Everyone has stuff.	Buli omu alina ebintu.
You can do the same thing.	Naawe osobola okukola ekintu kye kimu.
You don’t know how they are.	Tomanyi bwe bali.
He was going to.	Yali agenda.
But you know what it was like.	Naye omanyi bwe kyali.
He works long hours every day.	Akola essaawa nnyingi buli lunaku.
I can see again.	Nsobola okuddamu okulaba.
Very yes indeed.	Nnyo ye ddala.
He was really here.	Ddala yali wano.
Until, of course, it’s not.	Okutuusa nga, kya lwatu, si bwe kiri.
I had no idea.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
This is my room, she thought.	Kino kye kisenge kyange, bwe yalowooza.
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
He is lucky.	Alina omukisa.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Naye nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eyo.
He thinks he is very good.	Alowooza nti mulungi nnyo.
But this doesn’t seem to be the case.	Naye kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
We can do it better than ever.	Tusobola okukikola obulungi okusinga bwe kyali.
This is a party for you.	Eno kabaga eri ggwe.
That was hard to deal with.	Ekyo kyali kizibu okukola ku nsonga eyo.
You won’t know for a while.	Tojja kumanya okumala akaseera.
This book is for anyone and everyone.	Ekitabo kino kya muntu yenna na buli muntu.
Everything seems important.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kikulu.
It is a very important place.	Kifo kikulu nnyo.
I will have to read the book now!.	Nja kuba nnina okusoma ekitabo kati!.
I don’t think it is.	Sirowooza nti si bwe kiri.
You either have it or you don’t.	Oba olina oba tolina.
I was very ordinary.	Nali wa bulijjo nnyo.
Now there is.	Kati waliwo.
We’ll see what happens this week.	Tugenda kulaba ekigenda okubaawo wiiki eno.
Now perhaps he might do it again.	Kati oboolyawo ayinza okuddamu okukikola.
I just wanted to talk to him, talk to him.	Nnali njagala kwogera naye kyokka, okwogera naye.
My girlfriend knows but that is it.	Muganzi wange amanyi naye ekyo kye kiri.
In a way he was willing to do this.	Mu ngeri emu yali mwetegefu okukola kino.
The ride is smooth.	Okuvuga kugenda bulungi.
We could see it coming.	Twali tusobola okulaba nga kijja.
He talks a lot about his ideas.	Ayogera nnyo ku ndowooza ze.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
I was there this morning.	Mbadde awo enkya ya leero.
You will go on without me.	Ojja kugenda mu maaso nga sirina.
Will deal with that tomorrow.	Ajja kukola ku ekyo enkya.
That’s what they were at the time.	Ekyo kye baali mu kiseera ekyo.
It’s a lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi nnyo.
He looked so normal.	Yalabika nga wa bulijjo nnyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
Apparently everyone.	Kirabika buli muntu.
We’re going to try it your way.	Tugenda kugezaako mu ngeri yo.
He was sound asleep.	Yali yeebase bulungi.
I don’t have a brother at all.	Sirina muganda wange n’akatono.
I needed to be there help.	Nnali nneetaaga kubeerawo buyambi.
He was actually quite interested.	Mu butuufu yali ayagala nnyo.
And he knew that.	Era ekyo yali akimanyi.
I'm not now.	Siri kati.
I can’t go anywhere without it.	Siyinza kugenda yonna nga sirina.
I was happy to have him there.	Nnali musanyufu okubeera naye eyo.
I have no idea.	Nze sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
But he admitted nothing.	Naye tewali kye yakkiriza.
Anyone can be one.	Omuntu yenna asobola okuba omu.
Previously they were .	Emabegako baali nga .
I'll talk to my father.	Nja kwogera ne taata.
It’s a good book, he said, too.	Ekitabo kirungi, bwe yagambye, naye.
I was pretty sure that would happen.	Nnali nkakasa bulungi nti ekyo kijja kubaawo.
He said he needed time to think.	Yagambye nti yeetaaga obudde okulowooza.
It’s good to do the work.	Kirungi okukola omulimu.
I can’t stay.	Sisobola kusigala.
That.	Ekyo.
It doesn’t matter it doesn’t matter.	Si kikulu si kikulu.
And he was beautiful.	Era yali mulungi.
It’s good for everyone.	Kirungi eri buli muntu.
It was a serious problem.	Kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
He is talking to me.	Ayogera nange.
There is no grand plan.	Tewali nteekateeka ya maanyi.
Something for everyone.	Ekintu kya buli muntu.
I’m really neither here nor there.	Mu butuufu siri wano wadde eyo.
In the morning he felt better.	Ku makya yawulira bulungi.
All morning at the office.	Enkya yonna ku ofiisi.
It doesn’t matter what.	Si kikulu kiki.
I’m so sorry,’ he said.	Nsonyiwa nnyo,’ bwe yagambye.
He was a human being.	Yali muntu.
But it’s not true.	Naye si kituufu.
What time is it? 	Ssaawa mmeka?
But that is definitely not the case.	Naye mazima ddala ekyo si bwe kiri.
Yet it is not.	Ye si bwe kiri.
And you know it.	Era ggwe okimanyi.
I don’t know what that is.	Ekyo simanyi ki.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
I’m sure it will be good.	Nkakasa nti kijja kuba kirungi.
He would have to deal with that.	Ekyo yandibadde alina okukola ku nsonga eyo.
I had been to school.	Nnali mbadde ku ssomero.
This is not true at all.	Kino si kituufu n’akatono.
How will you come?	Ojja kujja otya?
And yet it is here.	Era naye kiri wano.
I love everything.	Njagala nnyo buli kimu.
I was just thinking about you.	Nze nali ndowooza ku ggwe kyokka.
But that doesn’t seem to be a good strategy.	Naye ekyo kirabika si nkola nnungi.
I’m not exactly alone in this.	Si nze nzekka ddala mu kino.
But that is not the case here.	Naye wano si bwe kiri.
He can do it.	Asobola okukikola.
It was home.	Yali waka.
Or we can do it together.	Oba tusobola okukikola nga tuli wamu.
And you know he’s okay.	Era omanyi nti talina buzibu.
He will have to watch.	Ajja kuba alina okulaba.
I wanted to know everything.	Nnali njagala okumanya buli kimu.
Not much more than that.	Si bingi okusinga ekyo.
I love this product.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino.
Everyone knows you are.	Buli omu akimanyi nti oli.
Almost the same as last week.	Kumpi kye kimu ne wiiki ewedde.
I am as beautiful as you are.	Nze ndi mulungi nga ggwe.
It was mine now.	Yali yange kati.
I'll agree.	Nja kukkiriza.
With that, on.	Nga olina ekyo, ku.
Now he wanted to go home.	Kati yali ayagala kudda waka.
I can't even.	Sisobola wadde.
He seems to be where he is now.	Alabika awo w’ali kati.
He is alone here, in this room.	Ali wano yekka, mu kisenge kino.
We have a plan.	Tulina enteekateeka.
They were there now.	Baali awo kati.
You will stay close.	Ojja kusigala kumpi.
And you can’t.	Era tosobola.
That’s right, like.	Ekyo kituufu, nga...
I have one right now.	Nnina emu mu kiseera kino.
He lives alone.	Abeera yekka.
But he has his reasons.	Naye alina ensonga ze.
I'll be.	Nja kuba.
Now he knows better.	Kati asinga okumanya.
Not only, by any means.	Si kyokka, mu ngeri yonna.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
Anyone can see.	Omuntu yenna ayinza okulaba.
She is a very nice lady.	Mukyala mulungi nnyo.
I know it was good.	Nkimanyi nti kyali kirungi.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
It’s difficult.	Kizibu.
I might get lucky.	Nnyinza okufuna omukisa.
He thought and he thought.	Yalowooza era n’alowooza.
The same goes for weddings.	Kye kimu ne ku mbaga.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
Someone is coming.	Waliwo ajja.
I wanted a home.	Nnali njagala awaka.
He is also a teacher.	Era musomesa.
I am not in a good place.	Siri mu kifo kirungi.
That book is not mine.	Ekitabo ekyo si kyange.
He was a happy man.	Yali muntu musanyufu.
It was just that.	Kyali ekyo kyokka.
You can, you can definitely do it.	Osobola, osobola okukikola ddala.
At the time this was a common occurrence.	Mu kiseera ekyo kino kyali kintu kya bulijjo.
And as it is.	Era nga bwe kiri.
But that was on the side, like.	Naye ekyo kyali ku ludda, nga.
This can range from one to many.	Kino kiyinza okuva ku kimu okutuuka ku bingi.
We are here to do the work.	Tuli wano okukola omulimu.
He may be busy.	Ayinza okuba nga bbize.
However, it is not the same for us.	Kyokka, gye tuli si kye kimu.
This was going to be easy.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kyangu.
It’s really pretty cool.	Ddala kirungi nnyo.
Or so he thought.	Oba bwe yalowooza.
You have to think.	Olina okulowooza.
He doesn’t know why he says that.	Tamanyi lwaki agamba bw’atyo.
He had many hours on it.	Yalina essaawa nnyingi ku yo.
Although not really.	Wadde nga si ddala.
No one knows who did it or why.	Tewali amanyi ani yakikola oba lwaki.
You can do anything.	Osobola okukola kyonna.
Then we have.	Awo tulina.
That's why.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki.
I am not a good woman.	Siri mukyala mulungi.
And there are no faces.	Era tewali maaso.
You should probably go now.	Oboolyawo wandibadde ogenda kati.
I, I, I.	Nze, nze, nze.
I couldn’t find one at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sisobola kufuna emu.
I hear but feel nothing.	Mpulira naye nga sirina kye mpulira.
He had so much.	Yalina bingi nnyo.
I have it too.	Nze nange nnina.
This is, of course, not the case here.	Kino, kya lwatu, si bwe kiri wano.
That’s pretty close.	Ekyo kiri kumpi nnyo.
I am glad he is with me.	Ndi musanyufu nti ali nange.
This will help a lot, the father said.	Kino kijja kuyamba nnyo, taata bwe yagambye.
Whatever it was.	Kyonna kye kyali.
And it may not be the only one.	Era kiyinza okuba nga si kye kyokka.
We have to work hard now.	Tulina okukola ennyo kati.
And he was very young.	Era nga muto nnyo.
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
You have to eat.	Olina okulya.
That’s all there is to it.	Ekyo kyokka kye kiri ku nsonga eyo.
The day, without trouble.	Olunaku, nga tewali buzibu.
That won’t happen here.	Ekyo tekijja kubaawo wano.
I’m sick of you.	Nze ndi mulwadde ku ggwe.
Way.	Engeri.
We will do well.	Tujja kukola bulungi.
A friend of mine did.	Mukwano gwange omu yakikola.
I’m fine now.	Nze kati ndi bulungi.
And he was sick.	Era yali mulwadde.
And here we are.	Era wano we tuli.
And yes, it’s true.	Era ye, kituufu.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
He is still young.	Akyali muto.
He went right to work.	Yagenda ddala ku mulimu.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
The work is real.	Omulimu gwa ddala.
He hoped it would never happen again.	Yalina essuubi nti tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
That's fine how do you do it.	Ekyo kirungi okola otya.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
He was alone at school.	Yali yekka ku ssomero.
But what we have.	Naye kye tulina.
I wanted to go.	Nnali njagala kugenda.
I said no, I didn't.	Nze nagamba nti nedda.
You and I, here, can do that.	Nze naawe, wano, ekyo tusobola okukikola.
But you knew that.	Naye ekyo wali okimanyi.
That would be a great place to live.	Ekyo kyandibadde kifo kirungi nnyo okubeera.
It already seems what.	Kirabika dda ki.
There was nothing we could do.	Tewali kye twali tusobola kukola.
It was truly a beautiful place.	Mazima ddala kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
I really didn’t want the truth.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala mazima.
You obviously want something from me.	Kya lwatu nti olina ky’oyagala okuva gyendi.
I don’t know if this is going to be a problem.	Simanyi oba kino kigenda kuba kizibu.
But this is my job.	Naye guno gwe mulimu gwange.
He was my brother.	Yali muganda wange.
It was a beautiful place.	Kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
. . . .	.
But he is in the city.	Naye ali mu kibuga.
It was the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu.
He may be the same.	Ayinza okuba nga naye.
He looked like.	Yalabika nga.
But here he was.	Naye wano we yali.
I don’t know myself.	Nze kennyini simanyi.
I'm here, that's why.	Nze ndi wano, y'ensonga.
But that doesn’t seem to be the problem here.	Naye ekyo kirabika si kye kizibu wano.
I need someone like that.	Nze nneetaaga omuntu nga oyo.
We were in love and it was real.	Twali mu mukwano era nga gwa ddala.
Don't know why he left.	Tomanyi lwaki yagenda.
I knew nothing about him at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
That was a bad thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi.
It’s not true actually.	Si kituufu mu butuufu.
He said it wouldn't happen.	Yagambye nti tekijja kubaawo.
But he got his chance.	Naye yafuna omukisa gwe.
We have a little time though.	Tulina akaseera katono wadde.
It will be this.	Kijja kuba kino.
You know that you.	Omanyi nti ggwe.
A little bit of it.	Katono ddala.
I’m not sure of anything really.	Sikakasa kintu kyonna ddala.
You can’t tell.	Tosobola kumanya.
Which, of course, he did.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kye yakola.
I have no idea why.	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki.
However, he could see nothing.	Kyokka yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
We cannot allow this to happen.	Kino tetusobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
I'm in trouble.	Nze nfunye obuzibu.
He hoped she was okay.	Yalina essuubi nti yali bulungi.
I will do this.	Kino nja kukikola.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
He needs some time.	Yeetaaga akaseera.
He wasn’t the man he was.	Si ye musajja gwe yali.
We were going home.	Twali tugenda kudda waka.
Or what he was doing.	Oba kye yali akola.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
It was my idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kyange.
That could happen again.	Ekyo kiyinza okuddamu okubaawo.
I can read that book.	Nsobola okusoma ekitabo ekyo.
It's my son, she thought.	Ye mwana wange, bwe yalowooza.
I think you know.	Ndowooza omanyi.
I can’t believe he’s doing this.	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kino akikola.
I just wanted my son.	Nnali njagala mwana wange yekka.
I think we can.	Ndowooza tusobola.
If anyone could, it would be him.	Singa waliwo asobola, yandibadde ye.
And that is very important.	Era ekyo kikulu nnyo.
He was happy to go with her.	Yali musanyufu okugenda naye.
No one was behind him.	Tewali yali emabega we.
I’m pretty good at this job.	Nze ndi mulungi nnyo ku mulimu guno.
He needed an opinion.	Yali yeetaaga endowooza.
The film began.	Firimu eno yatandika.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka kino si kituufu.
He doesn’t have time for this.	Kino talina budde.
It’s my job to see these things.	Omulimu gwange okulaba ebintu bino.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kye kimu.
That’s all he needs.	Ekyo kyokka kye yeetaaga.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
I knew better than that.	Nze nnali mmanyi okusinga ekyo.
This will not work.	Kino tekijja kukola.
The weather is really good.	Obudde buli bulungi ddala.
That is not the case at all.	Ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
I think it’s true.	Ndowooza nti kituufu.
No one was willing to talk.	Tewali yali mwetegefu kwogera.
No idea of ​​the plan.	Tewali kirowoozo ku nteekateeka.
It will be the same.	Kijja kuba kye kimu.
That's what he is.	Kye ky'ali.
There is no help there.	Tewali buyambi eyo.
It is very important to be on time.	Kikulu nnyo okutuuka mu budde.
Then there was nothing.	Awo nga tewali.
In this case, they are not.	Mu mbeera eno, si bwe bali.
Are you ready?	Oli mwetegefu?
That other one being you.	Oyo omulala okubeera ggwe.
He didn't even need to say much that way.	Yali teyeetaaga na kwogera bingi mu ngeri eyo.
I want to be real.	Njagala kubeera wa ddala.
I can’t do it either.	Nze nange sisobola.
There is no reason not to.	Tewali nsonga lwaki tetulina.
This is a terrible time.	Kino kiseera kibi nnyo.
All good with me.	Byonna bulungi nange.
Currently, he is in the process.	Mu kiseera kino, ali mu nteekateeka.
We need to address the problem immediately.	Tulina okukola ku kizibu ekyo mu bwangu.
I don’t really like it.	Sikyagala nnyo.
You said earlier.	Wagamba emabegako.
I can speak.	Nsobola okwogera.
He is a thing of the past.	Ye kintu kya dda.
No one could do it better.	Tewali yali asobola kukikola okusinga ekyo.
That’s the idea.	Eyo ye ndowooza.
It’s not good to talk.	Si kirungi okwogera.
That’s good for me.	Ekyo kirungi gyendi.
It was my idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kyange.
Everyone is there.	Buli omu ali awo.
He knows now.	Amanyi kati.
But he seems to be doing it.	Naye kirabika akikola.
You are not his friend.	Ggwe toli mukwano gwe.
I’m here in trouble.	Nze ndi wano mu buzibu.
Everything and everyone.	Buli kimu na buli muntu.
I could have everything.	Nnali nsobola okuba ne buli kimu.
You are not my brother, he said.	Si ggwe muganda wange, bwe yagamba.
It doesn’t matter why you are, only that you are here now.	Si kikulu lwaki oli, kyokka nti oli wano kati.
You can’t and won’t win.	Tosobola era tojja kuwangula.
I can never stay.	Siyinza n’akatono kusigala.
He comes a lot every day.	Ajja nnyo buli lunaku.
There are so many of these things.	Ebintu bino bingi nnyo.
I wish the floor would be lower though.	Njagala wansi wandibadde wansi wadde.
Same thing here.	Ekintu kye kimu wano.
Like in the movie.	Nga mu firimu.
I am not my best friend.	Siri mukwano gwange nnyo.
I know you want me too.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala nange.
This is the thing.	Kino kye kintu.
Nothing was too much trouble.	Tewali kyali kizibu nnyo.
No one will know.	Tewali ajja kumanya.
What do you think of that?	Ggwe olowooza ki ku ekyo?
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
Not that one though.	Si oyo wadde.
But this was real.	Naye kino kyali kya ddala.
I’m just a singer.	Nze ndi muyimbi yekka.
Not when we’re so close.	Si nga tuli kumpi nnyo.
Call for help from here.	Kuba essimu okufuna obuyambi okuva wano.
He is a good child.	Ye mwana mulungi.
This is my father’s room.	Kino kye kisenge kya taata.
He wasn’t there.	Si ye yali eyo.
I'm going to the hospital.	Ngenda mu ddwaaliro.
I love that movie.	Njagala nnyo firimu eyo.
Can you help?.	Osobola okuyamba?.
I didn’t know how bad it was.	Nnali simanyi nti kyali kibi nnyo.
I was all over the place.	Nali mu kifo kyonna.
He comes to us.	Ajja gye tuli.
Now he was really in trouble.	Kati ddala yali mu buzibu.
You have to eat this though.	Kino olina okulya wadde.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
She looks as good as ever.	Alabika bulungi nga bulijjo.
That’s not true here.	Ekyo si kituufu wano.
My father was very happy.	Taata yali musanyufu nnyo.
I probably will.	Oboolyawo nja kukikola.
From the.	Okuva mu...
But that’s not really the case.	Naye ekyo mu butuufu si kye kituufu.
As it was the case.	Nga bwe kyali.
He was just that kind of guy.	Yali ggaayi ddala bw’atyo.
Or for a little while.	Oba okumala akaseera katono.
Or tomorrow night.	Oba enkya ekiro.
I want to work with you.	Njagala kukola naawe.
This is obviously true.	Kino kya lwatu kituufu.
I couldn’t be happier.	Nnali siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo.
You don’t have anything.	Tolina kintu kyonna.
However, that’s not why.	Kyokka, si y’ensonga lwaki.
It’s not eye contact.	Si kulaba maaso.
That is what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
He was strong, manly, and handsome.	Yali wa maanyi, musajja era nga mulungi.
But it’s dangerous.	Naye kya bulabe.
We are actually very strong.	Mu butuufu tuli ba maanyi nnyo.
I’m totally ready to talk about anything.	Nze ndi mwetegefu ddala okwogera ku kintu kyonna.
You can’t do everything alone.	Buli kimu tosobola kukikola wekka.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
That would probably be easier.	Ekyo oboolyawo kyandibadde kyangu.
Getting out of jail that way.	Okuva mu kkomera mu ngeri eyo.
This is what he wanted.	Kino kye yali ayagala.
I thought you were the only one.	Nnalowooza nti ggwe wekka.
Which.	Nga.
And that seems like a lot.	Era ekyo kirabika nga bingi.
I know you can do this.	Nkimanyi nti kino osobola okukikola.
For a very long time.	Okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
I thought the same thing.	Nalowooza ekintu kye kimu.
Reverse.	Okudda emabega.
I didn’t even want to come here.	Nze nali saagala na kujja wano.
He didn’t want to talk about the baby.	Yali tayagala kwogera ku mwana.
That’s really not the point.	Ekyo ddala si kye kikulu nnyo.
But we will move forward.	Naye tujja kugenda mu maaso.
There is no good way.	Tewali ngeri yonna nnungi.
You don’t want to talk.	Toyagala kwogera.
That was something he could definitely do.	Ekyo kyali kintu kye yali asobola okukola mazima ddala.
I didn’t know what to say or how.	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera oba ngeri ki.
No one even knew who he was at the time.	Tewali yali amanyi wadde ani mu kiseera ekyo.
I didn’t know you were.	Nnali simanyi nti oli.
He says no, he doesn't.	Agamba nti nedda.
It was easy.	Kyali kyangu.
He had me and he knew it.	Yalina nze era yali akimanyi.
This product is in working order.	Ekintu kino kiri mu mbeera ya kukola.
That’s a lot of money.	Ekyo ssente nnyingi nnyo.
And that’s a problem.	Era ekyo kizibu.
Do you know if.	Omanyi oba...
Now you can get anything.	Kati osobola okufuna ekintu kyonna.
We don’t have anyone here.	Tetulina muntu yenna wano.
We have no current plans to do so.	Tetulina nteekateeka yonna mu kiseera kino okukikola.
It doesn’t really matter.	Si kikulu nnyo.
I don’t care about your opinion.	Nze sifaayo ku ndowooza yo.
You will see, you will see.	Ojja kulaba, ojja kulaba.
I want to win.	Njagala kuwangula.
He is just beautiful.	Ye mulungi yekka.
Too early to read.	Nga bukyali nnyo okusoma.
That’s the issue here.	Eyo y’ensonga eri wano.
I will do that.	Ekyo nja kukikola.
You can’t, you won’t.	Tosobola, tojja kukikola.
No problem.	Tewali buzibu.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
I’m not sure it will happen.	Sikakasa nti kijja kubaawo.
We cannot know.	Tetusobola kumanya.
You’re here a lot.	Ggwe wano nnyo.
I'm not even sure whose point of view.	Sikakasa na ndowooza ya ani.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
And it’s pretty good.	Era kirungi nnyo.
And maybe it doesn’t matter.	Era mpozzi nga si kikulu.
I may be alone on this one.	Nnyinza okuba nga ndi nzekka ku eno.
But it wasn’t him .	Naye si ye yali .
Indeed, this is true.	Mazima ddala, kino kituufu.
He didn’t know how or when.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ki oba ddi.
I don’t know what it is but it’s bad.	Simanyi kiki naye kibi.
He was willing to do it, of course.	Yali mwetegefu okukikola, ddala.
Is that your car there?	Eyo mmotoka yo eyo?
It’s a dangerous job.	Omulimu gwa bulabe.
I don’t want to talk to you.	Saagala kwogera naawe.
He is a good man.	Musajja mulungi.
I just couldn’t.	Nze nnali sisobola kyokka.
No, not really.	Nedda, si ddala.
' '.	' '.
He was a strong man.	Yali musajja wa maanyi.
He didn’t want that at all.	Ekyo yali tayagala n’akatono.
You have to do this.	Kino olina okukikola.
I have to go now, he said.	Nnina okugenda kati, bwe yagambye.
That’s what it was.	Kye kyali.
Reading things about.	Okusoma ebintu ku...
There is no truth in that.	Tewali mazima mu nsonga eyo.
He wants to talk.	Ayagala kwogera.
It could be us.	Kiyinza okuba ffe.
Easy to say, but hard to do.	Kyangu okwogera, naye nga kizibu okukola.
He's coming this afternoon.	Ajja akawungeezi ka leero.
Not like you.	Si nga ggwe.
Clearly, this was not her room.	Kya lwatu nti kino si kye kyali kisenge kye.
And he is very young.	Era muto nnyo.
I didn’t know you’d be here.	Nnali simanyi nti ojja kubeera wano.
They were here for something.	Baali wano lwa kintu.
But that’s not me.	Naye ekyo si nze.
We can’t do that.	Ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
To move forward, he needs to be good.	Okugenda mu maaso, yeetaaga okuba omulungi.
No, it’s true.	Nedda, kituufu.
No, he just couldn’t.	Nedda, yali tasobola kyokka.
That was the way it was.	Eyo ye yali engeri gye kyali.
I have to do it.	Nnina okukikola.
You can do that over a weekend.	Ekyo osobola okukikola ku wiikendi emu.
It had to be a dog.	Yalina okuba embwa.
And a lot of money.	Ne ssente nnyingi.
I don’t think he would be.	Sirowooza nti yandibadde bw’atyo.
You can answer.	Osobola okuddamu.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
He was a happy person and a really nice person.	Yali muntu musanyufu era nga ddala muntu mulungi.
To do what.	Okukola kiki.
The same thing with.	Ekintu kye kimu ne.
This seems perfectly fine to you.	Kino kirabika nga kirungi ddala gy’oli.
It certainly had.	Mazima ddala kyalina.
We can do this.	Kino tusobola okukikola.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
He always has.	Bulijjo alina.
Every morning to go to work.	Buli ku makya okugenda ku mulimu.
I have my job at the time.	Nnina omulimu gwange mu kiseera ekyo.
He would have to call himself.	Yandibadde alina okukuba essimu ye kennyini.
But, this is just an idea.	Naye, kino kirowoozo kyokka.
He thought it wasn’t.	Yalowooza nti si bwe kiri.
That will come.	Ekyo kijja kujja.
I’m doing pretty well.	Nze nkola bulungi nnyo.
I was ready to go.	Nnali mwetegefu okugenda.
That's the process for you.	Eyo ye nkola gy'oli.
Now that is very important!.	Kati ekyo kikulu nnyo!.
Which is why it felt so good.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki yawulira bulungi nnyo.
You can't '.	Tosobola '.
And it’s not good.	Era si kirungi.
Now he was going.	Kati yali agenda.
He must be very sick.	Ateekwa okuba nga mulwadde nnyo.
Everyone does it.	Buli omu akikola.
His friend said he would stay in his hometown.	Mukwano gwe yagamba nti ajja kusigala mu kibuga kye.
I didn’t know what to do with him.	Nnali simanyi kya kukola ku ye.
It’s what he is.	Kye ky’ali.
Of course, everyone wants to be a doctor.	Kya lwatu nti buli muntu ayagala kubeera musawo.
That was serious it was romantic.	Ekyo kyali kya maanyi kyali kya mukwano.
He needs to talk.	Yeetaaga okwogera.
Not this room.	Si kisenge kino.
It will be hard to come back from here.	Kijja kuba kizibu okudda okuva wano.
That alone is an opinion.	Ekyo kyokka kiri ndowooza.
He certainly knew better than that.	Mazima ddala yali amanyi okusinga ekyo.
You can’t do this thing.	Tosobola kukola kintu kino.
I don't know where.	Simanyi wa.
But either way,.	Naye mu ngeri yonna,...
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
He had been in this position himself.	Ye kennyini yali abadde mu kifo kino.
No one knows what, or how much.	Tewali amanyi ki, oba mmeka.
He hadn't and there it was.	Yali talina era awo we kyali.
He always works hard.	Bulijjo akola nnyo.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
And that’s not all.	Era ekyo si kye kyokka.
And it’s very difficult.	Era kizibu nnyo.
It’s just a moment.	Akaseera katono ddala.
Her boyfriend is a nice man.	Muganzi we musajja mulungi.
I had no choice.	Nnali sirina kya kukola.
They were in a lot of trouble.	Baali mu buzibu bungi.
Good to know, to have in that way.	Kirungi okumanya, okubeera ne mu ngeri eyo.
We were here to help.	Twali wano okuyamba.
Here he was for a while.	Wano we yali okumala akaseera.
We can do this together.	Kino tusobola okukikola nga tuli wamu.
He couldn't answer.	Yali tasobola kuddamu.
This is close.	Kino kiri kumpi.
He had been lucky.	Yali abadde wa mukisa.
And it was really normal.	Era ddala kyali kya bulijjo.
Anyone would want to work with you.	Omuntu yenna yandiyagadde okukola naawe.
However, not really.	Kyokka, si ddala.
But that’s not what matters.	Naye ekyo si kye kikulu.
This is complicated and this is.	Kino kizibu era kino kiri...
Now we have to work.	Kati tulina okukola.
Maybe that’s true.	Mpozzi ekyo kituufu.
My father is always asleep.	Taata bulijjo yeebase.
He was young.	Yali muto.
What do we have going on here? 	Kiki kye tulina ekigenda mu maaso wano?
You can go back to work tomorrow.	Osobola okudda ku mulimu enkya.
She would have to talk to him about it.	Yandibadde alina okwogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
I can’t do anything right.	Siyinza kukola kituufu kyonna.
Everyone does that.	Ekyo buli omu akikola.
I know nothing about him.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
In fact, you were more than good, you were beautiful.	Mu butuufu, wali okusinga bulungi, wali mulungi.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
It’s not a group.	Si kibiina.
Even this is my opinion.	Ne eno ndowooza yange.
To someone, anyone.	Eri omuntu, omuntu yenna.
I was pretty good then.	Nali mulungi nnyo mu kiseera ekyo.
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
What is this.	Kiki kino.
Everyone had an opinion.	Buli omu yalina endowooza.
Everyone knew their job.	Buli omu yali amanyi omulimu gwe.
It is true in a sense.	Kituufu mu ngeri emu.
I didn’t want to either.	Nange nnali saagala.
It’s not pretty and would need work.	Si nnungi era yandibadde yeetaaga omulimu.
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
I just want to be home.	Njagala kubeera waka kyokka.
I want to get back to work.	Njagala kudda ku mulimu.
But he just couldn’t accept that.	Naye ekyo yali tasobola kukkiriza kyokka.
In this case it is a good thing.	Mu mbeera eno kintu kirungi.
He tried to do it.	Yagezaako okukikola.
But, you know, it is.	Naye, omanyi, kye kiri.
I can’t my friend.	Sisobola mukwano gwange.
And probably something about how he was a really good friend.	Era oboolyawo ekintu ku ngeri gye yali mukwano omulungi ddala.
But this is not very important.	Naye kino si kikulu nnyo.
This is in the air.	Kino kiri mu bbanga.
But not everyone can do that.	Naye ekyo buli muntu tasobola kukikola.
And, of course, attitude.	Era, ddala, endowooza.
I have to say this.	Kino nnina okwogera.
Something he didn’t want to happen.	Ekintu kye yali tayagala kubaawo.
The thing is simple.	Ekintu kyangu.
She was as good to me as she looked.	Yali mulungi gyendi nga bwe yali alabika.
What is my younger brother doing now?	Kati muto wange akola ki?
That’s all he would do.	Ekyo kyokka kye yandikoze.
You’re in the hospital.	Oli mu ddwaaliro.
With the police.	Nga bali ne poliisi.
Or in any way, really.	Oba mu ngeri yonna, ddala.
I'm in the middle.	Nze ndi mu.
However, it is not an issue.	Kyokka, si nsonga.
That won’t happen.	Ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
Or so he believed.	Oba bwatyo bwe yakkiriza.
This is very important to do early on.	Kino kikulu nnyo okukikola nga bukyali.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
It’s just too complicated.	Kizibu nnyo kyokka.
Like he would do that.	Nga bwe yandikoze ekyo.
He should be in the hospital.	Alina okuba mu ddwaaliro.
Why don't you have it all?.	Lwaki tolina byonna?.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
I knew that wasn’t the case.	Nnali nkimanyi nti ekyo si bwe kyali.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
Here was where he was.	Wano we yali wa.
You will never get your house back.	Tojja kuddamu kufuna nnyumba yo.
He wasn’t happy with her.	Yali si musanyufu naye.
I couldn’t go on.	Nnali sisobola kugenda mu maaso.
I am ready.	Ndi mwetegefu.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
In that room.	Mu kisenge ekyo.
Very simple actually.	Kyangu nnyo mu butuufu.
I will never do that to any of my children.	Ekyo sijja kukikola ku mwana wange yenna.
But he must be asleep.	Naye alina okuba nga yeebase.
He said he did too.	Yagambye nti naye yakikola.
He lives here.	Abeera wano.
Either way, he had to get home on time.	Mu ngeri yonna, yalina okutuuka awaka mu budde.
He wasn’t really a man.	Mu butuufu yali si musajja.
I might be the same.	Nze nnyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
Or he is.	Oba ye.
It was really difficult.	Ddala kyali kizibu.
But in this case, he could.	Naye mu kino, yali asobola.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
No, not just a person.	Nedda, si muntu yekka.
However, he really didn’t want to know.	Kyokka mu butuufu yali tayagala kumanya.
What city is this?	Kino kibuga ki?
I don’t have a job.	Nze sirina mulimu.
But, you know, it’s true.	Naye, omanyi, kituufu.
That would be easy.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu.
No, he isn’t.	Nedda, si bw’atyo.
I was everywhere and anything.	Nali buli wamu era ekintu kyonna.
But it’s not good for me.	Naye si kirungi gyendi.
I really hope this is true.	Nsuubira ddala kino kituufu.
No, no, it's not.	Nedda nedda.
No one needs these things.	Ebintu bino tewali yeetaaga.
Went.	Agenda.
I’m not really alone.	Si ddala nzekka.
What time is it? 	Ssaawa mmeka?
. . . .	.
I just want to be home again.	Njagala kuddamu kubeera waka kyokka.
It was a house.	Yali nnyumba.
He is not the only one who does things like this.	Si ye yekka akola ebintu nga bino.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
And there is no talking.	Era tewali kwogera.
I have that too.	Ekyo nange nnina.
And my father.	Ne taata wange.
He knew he would never come back here.	Yali akimanyi nti tajja kudda wano.
We’ll know.	Tujja kumanya.
Anyone but him.	Omuntu yenna okuggyako ye.
I want one too.	Nze nange njagala emu.
And we needed to hit.	Era twali twetaaga okukuba.
Now there is nowhere to go.	Kati tewali wa kugenda.
It could be tomorrow.	Kiyinza okuba enkya.
I will never have my period again.	Sijja kuddamu kugenda mu nsonga.
He knew he had a problem.	Yali akimanyi nti alina ekizibu.
Back to the system.	Okudda ku nkola.
I hope you don’t mind.	Nsuubira nti tolina buzibu.
And he didn’t have to go.	Era yali talina kugenda.
And it’s really.	Era nga ddala.
And he couldn’t believe it.	Era nga tasobola kukkiriza.
And there are so many more.	Era bingi nnyo.
I was well aware of that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi bulungi.
In so many cases, you have to do the work.	Mu mbeera nnyingi nnyo, olina okukola omulimu.
Not here, not now.	Si wano, si kati.
There is no answer.	Tewali kuddamu.
I'm thinking.	Nze ndowooza.
I know who his dad was too.	Nze nange mmanyi taata we gwe yali.
And he was very sick.	Era yali mulwadde nnyo.
We were very close friends.	Twali ba mukwano nnyo.
He won’t talk to us.	Tajja kwogera naffe.
This morning, of course.	Enkya ya leero, ddala.
She wanted to, she thought.	Yali ayagala, bwe yalowooza.
I only have one thing.	Nnina ekintu kimu kyokka.
No one knew where he lived.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yali abeera.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
Together they are powerful.	Nga bali wamu ba maanyi.
You, isn’t it?	Ggwe, si bwe kiri?
He is in office now.	Ali ku ofiisi kati.
That won’t be good.	Ekyo tekijja kuba kirungi.
I work hard.	Nkola nnyo.
Someone else said he was.	Omuntu omulala yagamba nti yali.
But whatever, man.	Naye kyonna, musajja.
None did well.	Tewali yakola bulungi.
I have to go again.	Nnina okuddamu okugenda.
But one thing .	Naye ekintu kimu .
While it’s a common practice, it’s not ideal.	Wadde nga nkola ya bulijjo, si nnungi nnyo.
He would be safe here.	Wano yandibadde talina bulabe.
This is not the same.	Kino si kye kimu.
We leave as soon as we can.	Tugenda amangu ddala nga bwe tusobola.
But he was young.	Naye yali muto.
But that doesn’t really matter.	Naye ekyo si kikulu nnyo.
I’m fine now.	Nze kati ndi bulungi.
He was still young.	Yali akyali muto.
What he is now.	Ky’ali kati.
For a moment, no one spoke.	Okumala akaseera, tewali yayogera.
But he really hadn’t.	Naye ddala yali talina.
Did you know what it is.	Obadde omanyi kiki.
At that point.	Ku kifo ekyo.
I don’t know why he talked to me about it.	Simanyi lwaki yayogera nange ku nsonga eyo.
He told me.	Yang’amba.
The one from the movie.	Oyo okuva mu firimu.
He did that reluctantly.	Ekyo yakikola nga tayagala.
He will go, but she will not stay.	Ajja kugenda, naye ye tajja kusigala.
But it really comes close.	Naye ddala kijja kumpi.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
That’s just one thing.	Ekyo kintu kimu kyokka.
And it’s mine.	Era kyange.
About an hour ago.	Ssaawa nga emu emabega.
I have you.	Nze nnina ggwe.
And he did that very well.	Era ekyo yakikola bulungi nnyo.
You should have known that.	Ekyo wandibadde okimanyi.
He got a lot done.	Yafuna bingi bye yakola.
No male doctor would do.	Tewali musajja musawo yandikoze.
I know you do, though.	Nkimanyi nti okola, naye.
I just wanted to talk.	Nnali njagala kwogera kyokka.
In my opinion it is the case here.	Mu ndowooza yange bwe kiri wano.
Anything can happen.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
To him it was the same.	Eri ye kyali kye kimu.
But you have to go.	Naye olina okugenda.
Or well, almost none.	Oba bulungi, kumpi tewali.
I thought about this .	Nalowooza ku nsonga eno .
Everything will not be the same.	Buli kimu tekijja kuba kye kimu.
I want that for my son.	Ekyo njagala ku mwana wange.
It's good, it's good.	Kirungi kirungi.
This is true, very true.	Kino kituufu, kituufu nnyo.
That will work.	Ekyo kijja kukola.
I was safe there.	Nnali sirina bulabe eyo.
It was time to do it again.	Kyali kiseera okuddamu okukikola.
He says no, he doesn't.	Agamba nti nedda.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
He started working.	Yatandika okukola.
This is a really, really bad idea.	Kino kirowoozo kibi ddala ddala.
He could get in trouble maybe, but he went on.	Yali asobola okufuna obuzibu osanga, naye yagenda mu maaso.
You don’t really know why.	Mu butuufu tomanyi lwaki.
It's good, it's good.	Kirungi, kirungi.
I think it was really good.	Ndowooza ddala kyali kirungi.
He is in good shape as well.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi naye.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
I don’t quite know why.	Simanyi bulungi lwaki.
But he was still young.	Naye yali akyali muto.
No one should have to deal with this.	Tewali muntu yenna yandibadde alina kukola ku nsonga eno.
Lots of movies.	Firimu nnyingi.
I think he's still a pretty good player.	Ndowooza akyali muzannyi mulungi nnyo.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
You could do anything, there.	Oyinza okukola ekintu kyonna, eyo.
Now it’s my turn.	Kati kye kiseera kyange.
This is exactly the case.	Kino ddala bwe kiri.
That’s what we’re down to.	Ekyo kye tuli wansi.
No one knew where he went.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yagenda.
I don’t care what he said.	Sifaayo ku bye yayogera.
It’s not me.	Si nze.
You don’t want a man.	Toyagala musajja.
That’s not a thing.	Ekyo si kintu.
Not making friends.	Obutakola mikwano.
Everyone does.	Buli muntu akola.
He can’t go home.	Tasobola kudda waka.
He is a very dangerous man.	Musajja wa bulabe nnyo.
This is no problem at all.	Kino tewali buzibu bwonna.
It is the process.	Ye nkola.
There is such a thing.	Waliwo ekintu ng’ekyo.
He knew he was safe.	Yali akimanyi nti talina bulabe.
We have .	Tulina .
I want to be a teacher.	Njagala kubeera musomesa.
I think he did it.	Ndowooza yakikola.
Not much.	Si bingi.
Or you don’t have to do it.	Oba tolina kukikola.
In this case.	Mu mbeera eno.
I don’t know what it was.	Simanyi kye kyali.
But no, that is not the case.	Naye nedda, ekyo si bwe kiri.
Now, you know better than to do that.	Kati, omanyi okusinga okukola ekyo.
I wanted to be strong.	Nnali njagala kubeera wa maanyi.
It won’t last long now.	Tekijja kumala bbanga ddene kati.
And movie time.	Era obudde bwa firimu.
Or a car.	Oba mmotoka.
He wanted to know where it might be.	Yali ayagala okumanya we kiyinza okuba.
Honestly, it doesn’t matter.	Mu butuufu, si kikulu.
in.	mu.
But he was beautiful.	Naye yali mulungi.
But that’s in a way.	Naye ekyo kiri mu ngeri.
I hope I could help.	Nsuubira nti nnali nsobola okuyamba.
No one could do much more.	Tewali yali asobola kukola nnyo okusinga ekyo.
But in my opinion, that’s not really the case.	Naye mu ndowooza yange, ekyo si bwe kiri ddala.
I love the guy.	Njagala nnyo ggaayi.
I don’t think there’s anything we can do about it.	Sirowooza nti waliwo kye tusobola okukola ku nsonga eno.
Probably no one does.	Oboolyawo tewali akikola.
He should have been down that way, everyone said.	Yandibadde wansi mu ngeri eyo, buli omu bwe yagamba.
He was speaking well.	Yali ayogera bulungi.
My father was very sick.	Taata yali mulwadde nnyo.
Not easy, of course not.	Si kyangu, ddala si bwe kiri.
He's going home.	Agenda waka.
That was a good idea.	Ekyo kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
I know he will do it.	Nkimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
She is very young and very, very sick.	Muto nnyo era mulwadde nnyo nnyo.
You don’t have the money.	Tolina ssente.
I think what will happen.	Ndowooza kiki ekigenda okubaawo.
It will be easier this way.	Kijja kuba kyangu mu ngeri eno.
I can work hard.	Nsobola okukola ennyo.
He should have worked, he should have worked.	Yandibadde akola, yandibadde akola.
That’s easy to make money.	Ekyo kyangu okufuna ssente.
Or unless we have someone else.	Oba okuggyako nga tulina omuntu omulala.
I don’t think this will ever happen again.	Sirowooza nti kino kijja kuddamu okubaawo.
A good father.	Taata mulungi.
I'm really.	Nze ddala.
They probably were, slightly.	Oboolyawo baali, katono.
Is that right?.	Ekyo kituufu?.
He was more of a friend than a curiosity.	Yali musajja wa mukwano nnyo okusinga omuntu ayagala okumanya.
I feel lucky to have money.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa okuba ne ssente.
That’s right, one by one.	Ekyo kituufu, kimu ku kimu.
I have a problem here.	Nze wano nnina obuzibu.
He would be a good friend.	Yandibadde mukwano mulungi.
The things he said.	Ebintu bye yayogera.
However, he did not want this.	Kyokka kino yali tayagala.
Working with him.	Okukola naye.
I think you know that.	Ndowooza ekyo okimanyi.
I hope they are okay.	Nsuubira nti bali bulungi.
They are on the house.	Bali ku nnyumba.
He was in good shape.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi.
Lucky because he was good.	Omukisa kuba yali mulungi.
Anyone can beat anyone.	Omuntu yenna asobola okukuba omuntu yenna.
What should we do today?	Kiki kye tusaanidde okukola leero?
It’s a beautiful city.	Kibuga kirungi.
Anything will do, really.	Ekintu kyonna kijja kukola, ddala.
He lives there now.	Abeera eyo kati.
He just wanted me.	Yali ayagala nze nzekka.
He must be lucky.	Ateekwa okuba nga wa mukisa.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo ddala kituufu.
It looks worse than it is.	Kirabika kibi okusinga bwe kiri.
That's one of the.	Ekyo kye kimu ku...
He said it was a great idea.	Yagambye nti kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
But he wanted something.	Naye yali alina ky’ayagala.
That was like .	Ekyo kyali nga .
He did, and in what way.	Yakola, era mu ngeri ki.
That was a good point.	Eyo yali nsonga nnungi.
This is a good thing.	Kino kintu kirungi.
I don’t want to know.	Saagala kumanya.
It would be nice to be home.	Kyandibadde kirungi okubeera awaka.
And he is in trouble.	Era ali mu buzibu.
But anyway.	Naye engeri yonna.
Very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo, kirungi nnyo.
But lucky for you, you can’t find anything.	Naye omukisa gyoli, tosobola kufuna kintu kyonna.
Everything was bad.	Buli kimu kyali kibi.
From here you are good to go.	Okuva wano oli mulungi okugenda.
That’s not what we have here.	Ekyo si kye tulina wano.
And then you.	Era awo ggwe.
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
It seems about right to me.	Kirabika nga kituufu gyendi.
I have to tell the police about this.	Kino nnina okubuulira poliisi.
I don’t really know.	Mu butuufu simanyi.
Maybe it would be great.	Mpozzi kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
It could be for you too.	Naawe kiyinza okuba nga kya ggwe.
That’s what he wants to be.	Ekyo ayagala kubeera ye.
He is in good shape.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi.
He had his personality.	Yalina omuntu we.
But he wanted to wait.	Naye yali ayagala kulinda.
No problem, really.	Tewali buzibu, ddala.
I can do that now.	Ekyo nsobola okukikola kati.
Or he was, anyway.	Oba yali, mu ngeri yonna.
Not to us, anyway.	Si gye tuli, mu ngeri yonna.
You’re going to be just fine.	Ogenda kuba bulungi nnyo.
He didn’t know what was going to happen.	Yali tamanyi kyali kigenda kubaawo.
You know where it is.	Omanyi gye kiri.
That’s the right thing to do.	Kye kituufu.
Not as it is now.	Si nga bwe kiri kati.
I could have done it.	Nnali nsobola okukikola.
I don’t know where to go from here.	Simanyi gye ngenda okuva wano.
I was a good guy.	Nze nali ggaayi mulungi.
He was doing very well in school.	Yali akola bulungi nnyo mu ssomero.
He will recover quickly.	Ajja kuddamu amaanyi mu bwangu.
It is absolutely true.	Kituufu ddala.
Nothing, and nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna, era tewali.
My schedule is not very good.	Enteekateeka yange si nnungi nnyo.
You have no strength.	Tolina maanyi.
At the same time.	Mu kiseera kye kimu.
It’s not really something.	Si kintu ddala.
I need to talk to you	Nnina okwogera naawe
Either way, no one was home at this point.	Mu ngeri yonna, tewali yali waka mu kiseera kino.
I feel really good	Mpulira bulungi ddala
Something he would do.	Ekintu kye yandikoze.
You know you’re happy.	Omanyi nti oli musanyufu.
Maybe not friends.	Mpozzi si mikwano.
He has to be better than ever.	Alina okuba omulungi okusinga bwe yali abadde.
We’re going to make everything work.	Tugenda kukola buli kimu okukola.
However, I loved it.	Kyokka, nnali njagala nnyo.
I don’t really know what to expect.	Simanyi bulungi kye nsuubira.
Actually, this is not entirely true.	Mu butuufu, kino si kituufu ddala.
It would probably be nice if you could.	Oboolyawo kyandibadde kirungi singa osobola.
Not that it’s a bad thing.	Si nti kintu kibi.
I am willing to do it	Ndi mwetegefu okukikola
But he was very much that.	Naye yali nnyo ekyo.
I knew he was a real person	Nali nkimanyi nti muntu ddala
In him, they are.	Mu ye, bali.
It doesn’t matter who.	Si kikulu ani.
Close but not too close.	Kumpi naye nga si kumpi nnyo.
And it doesn’t matter.	Era si kikulu.
I still can’t figure out what they are	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kumanya kye bali
You can do it again.	Osobola okuddamu okukikola.
And it will happen.	Era kijja kubaawo.
I know the whole thing.	Nze ekintu kyonna nkimanyi.
I know everything that goes on here	Buli ekigenda mu maaso wano nkimanyi
That’s fine for now.	Ekyo kirungi mu kiseera kino.
You’re moving forward.	Ggwe ogenda mu maaso.
Maybe that’s okay, he thought.	Mpozzi ekyo si kibi, bwe yalowooza.
I can’t go back to my dad	Sisobola kudda eri taata wange
I will be alone.	Nja kuba nzekka.
There are so many reasons.	Ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
It is indeed excellent.	Mazima ddala kirungi nnyo.
But now he was ready to talk.	Naye kati yali mwetegefu okwogera.
It’s going to be a player.	Kigenda kuba muzannyi.
I didn’t think it would happen though	Nali sirowooza nti kijja kubaawo wadde
I want to talk about you	Njagala kwogera ku ggwe
I thought it would be easy	Nalowooza nti kyandibadde kyangu
I hope you know that	Nsuubira nti ekyo okimanyi
I wanted to know how he dealt with everything	Nnali njagala okumanya engeri gye yali akola ku buli kimu
We have to work.	Tulina okukola.
I’m so sorry, not really	Nsonyiwa nnyo, si ddala
I know he wasn’t.	Nkimanyi nti si bwe yali.
What we are.	Kye tuli.
They are the same.	Bali kye kimu.
I have to get to this point	Nnina okutuuka ku nsonga eno
I know this will probably never happen again	Nkimanyi nti kino osanga tekijja kuddamu kubaawo
I didn’t want to know more	Nnali saagala kumanya bingi
The same goes for speech.	Kye kimu ne ku kwogera.
As he would have done.	Nga bwe yandikoze.
I’m going to be here	Ngenda kubeera wano
Or not even that.	Oba si wadde ekyo.
I wanted him to form his own opinions	Nnali njagala akole endowooza ze
And it is the time.	Era kye kiseera.
I’ve always loved working at night	Bulijjo njagala nnyo okukola ekiro
For the same thing.	Ku kintu kye kimu.
I know nothing in this situation.	Sirina kye mmanyi mu mbeera eno.
I don’t know who started this	Simanyi ani yatandika kino
In that system, however, that is not the case.	Kyokka mu nkola eyo, ekyo si bwe kiri.
Perhaps you have a passion.	Oboolyawo olina ky’oyagala ennyo.
There is nothing more dangerous than that.	Tewali kintu kya bulabe okusinga ekyo.
I just know where you are	Nze mmanyi gyoli kyokka
And so he was.	Era bw’atyo bwe yali.
He is the only one.	Ye yekka yekka.
That doesn’t matter.	Ekyo si kikulu.
I don’t want to know	Nze saagala kumanya
This is a good thing for me.	Kino kintu kirungi gyendi.
I want to be both, of course.	Njagala kubeera bombi, ddala.
It’s going to happen.	Kigenda kubaawo.
He should have known.	Yandibadde amanyi.
I don’t even think he knew that.	Ekyo sirowooza na nti yali akimanyi.
I didn’t really care	Nnali sifaayo nnyo
I didn’t know what to do now	Nali simanyi kya kukola kati
I think he was a man	Ndowooza yali musajja
I don’t like it anymore	Kati sikyagala
But it’s good.	Naye kirungi.
I knew it was time to go	Namanya nti kye kiseera okugenda
I really like that guy	Njagala nnyo ggaayi oyo
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
I couldn’t drive a car.	Nnali sisobola kuvuga mmotoka.
What the other did.	Omulala kye yakola.
It’s exactly the same.	Kye kimu ddala.
I used to be a child	Nze nnali mbeera mwana muto
But he doesn’t want to stay.	Naye tayagala kusigala.
He had to be safe.	Yalina okuba nga talina bulabe.
I really wanted to leave the room.	Nnali njagala nnyo okuva mu kisenge.
We are on the spot.	Tuli ku kifo.
You may know that too.	Ekyo naawe oyinza okuba nga okimanyi.
My brother is at work.	Muganda wange ali ku mulimu.
It’s not exactly a problem.	Si kizibu ddala.
I wasn’t sure what he did now	Nali sikakasa kye yakola kati
Apparently this was not the case.	Kirabika kino si bwe kyali.
I didn’t know how to respond	Nnali simanyi ngeri ya kuddamu
What exactly do you want.	Kiki ddala kyoyagala.
I can’t live with him alone	Siyinza kubeera naye nzekka
I have no expectations of you	Sirina kye nsuubira nti ojja kukikola
He is really very good.	Ddala mulungi nnyo.
None of this matters.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kikulu.
No one needs to know.	Tewali yeetaaga kumanya.
We have to think about planning.	Tulina okulowooza ku nteekateeka.
Not the way he had it.	Si ngeri gye yalina.
I expected trouble	Nali nsuubira obuzibu
I can’t wait until tomorrow	Siyinza kulinda okutuusa enkya
He doesn’t want to do this either.	Kino naye tayagala kukikola.
This is not lucky.	Kino si kya mukisa.
I was only young, but it was easy	Nnali muto kyokka, naye kyali kyangu
I hope he does soon	Nsuubira nti ajja kukikola mu bbanga ttono
I had no immediate idea to say.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kya mangu kya kwogera.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
I guess, this is the problem.	Ntebereza, kino kye kizibu.
You know this now.	Kino okimanyi kati.
I know they are home next weekend	Nkimanyi nti wiikendi ejja bali waka
This is too easy for the police.	Kino kyangu nnyo eri poliisi.
I thought about what he said	Nalowooza ku bye yayogera
Soon he is in.	Mu bbanga ttono abeera mu.
That’s not very good.	Ekyo si kirungi nnyo.
I think he's doing well though	Ndowooza akola bulungi wadde
I wonder what he saw.	Nneebuuza kye yalaba.
I couldn’t believe he was going to all the trouble	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti yali agenda mu buzibu bwonna
I hope he does come.	Nsuubira nti ddala ajja.
I had absolutely nothing to do	Nnali sirina kye nkola ddala
I can't see.	Sisobola kulaba.
I am very happy.	Nze ndi musanyufu nnyo.
He said he was.	Yagambye nti yali...
Nothing to see there.	Tewali kya kulaba awo.
To me, it is, in this case.	Eri nze, bwe kiri, mu mbeera eno.
You know things.	Omanyi ebintu.
I had no answer	Nze nali sirina kya kuddamu
I want to see my classroom again.	Njagala kuddamu kulaba kibiina kyange.
I do what he wants	Nze nkola ky’ayagala
I hope there’s someone there	Nsuubira nti waliwo omuntu awo
I love money.	Njagala nnyo ssente.
The other is younger, but not younger.	Omulala muto, naye si muto.
This is something.	Kino waliwo ekintu.
It certainly would be.	Mazima ddala kyandibadde.
You will be able to get those.	Ojja kusobola okufuna ebyo.
But there is no working.	Naye tewali kukola.
I know he is in a hurry.	Nkimanyi nti ye mu bwangu.
We have everything here.	Buli kimu tulina wano.
I hope he is not home now	Nsuubira kati tali waka
I feel so alone	Nze mpulira nga ndi nzekka nnyo
And no one was happy.	Era tewali yali musanyufu.
He’s not going to have anything he wants.	Tagenda kubeera na ky’ayagala.
That's what he said.	Ebyo bye yayogera.
I'm not quite sure how long	Sikakasa bulungi bbanga ki
And obviously not very good.	Era kirabika si kirungi nnyo.
He didn't want to believe that.	Ekyo yali tayagala kukkiriza.
I can’t say anything	Siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna
I had no immediate idea to say	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kya mangu kya kwogera
Tomorrow is coming.	Enkya ejja.
I wanted to be a doctor	Nnali njagala kubeera musawo
And it would be.	Era kyandibadde.
Below is one of the ways.	Wansi waliwo emu ku ngeri.
I just want to stay together	Njagala kusigala ffembi kyokka
I feel better about it now.	Nze kati mpulira bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
Said.	Agamba.
I needed to be with him	Nnali nneetaaga okubeera naye
He was young.	Yali muto.
He has something for everyone.	Waliwo ekintu ky’alina eri buli muntu.
But he is more beautiful.	Naye asinga kuba mulungi.
I love you so much	Njagala nnyo ggwe
I can’t say anything.	Siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna.
It’s hard, but it’s normal.	Kizibu, naye nga kya bulijjo.
I love it here	Njagala nnyo wano
I think he was on to something	Ndowooza yali ku kintu
I wasn’t sure if you had been here before	Nali sikakasa oba wali obadde wano emabegako
I thought about the house	Nalowooza ku nnyumba
But someone has to do it.	Naye waliwo alina okukikola.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
I'm fine with that.	Ekyo ndi bulungi.
I knew, though, that my father needed to work on this	Kyokka nnali nkimanyi nti taata yali yeetaaga okukola ku nsonga eno
I don’t like that.	Ekyo sikyagala.
I hope to talk to you tomorrow	Nsuubira okwogera naawe enkya
I have to be myself	Nnina kubeera nze kennyini
But, this is the problem.	Naye, kino kye kizibu.
It’s important to me.	Kikulu gyendi.
I want it here too	Njagala wano nange
I will never do this again.	Kino sijja kuddamu kukikola.
He knew who he was.	Yali amanyi ani gwe yali.
This is not a good place to be.	Kino si kifo kirungi okubeera.
I’m the only person there	Nze nzekka omuntu ali eyo
I don’t want either side to know we’re here.	Saagala buli ludda kumanya nti tuli wano.
I can’t say anything more than that	Siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna okusinga ekyo
I couldn’t tell what it was	Nnali sisobola kumanya ki kye kyali
I feel pretty good there there right now.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo eyo eyo mu kiseera kino.
I'm glad you're here!	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano!
There is no thought.	Tewali kirowoozo kyonna.
He was very friendly. 	Yali wa mukwano nnyo. 
I loved it, all of it	Nnali njagala nnyo, byonna
They were probably too busy.	Oboolyawo baali bbize nnyo.
I know you’re very busy	Nkimanyi nti oli bbize nnyo
No one has a problem.	Tewali alina buzibu.
I just have to know what it is	Nnina okumanya kye kiri kyokka
Or it would be.	Oba kyandibadde.
We can’t do it.	Tetusobola kukikola.
I think it’s a good thing	Ndowooza nti kintu kirungi
No, not really, she said.	Nedda, si ddala, bwe yagamba.
He's good now.	Mulungi kati.
I didn’t know how to respond	Nnali simanyi ngeri gye nnali nnyinza kuddamu
I have something to do tonight	Nnina kye nkola ekiro kino
I love this picture	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi kino
I wasn’t sure at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sikakasa
I need to do it that way	Nze nneetaaga okukikola mu ngeri eyo
Here and now.	Wano ne kati.
No one knew where it was.	Tewali yali amanyi gye kyali.
And you have to do the same.	Era naawe olina okukola kye kimu.
He's at a party.	Ali ku kabaga.
I knew it had to be	Namanya nti kyalina okuba nga bwe kyali
It would be dangerous.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe.
All of this.	Bino byonna.
He doesn’t like anyone.	Tayagala muntu yenna.
However, this is not always the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri buli kiseera.
I knew that wasn’t the case with any of us	Namanya nti ekyo si bwe kyali ku muntu yenna ku ffe
I guess you might as well.	Ntebereza nti oyinza okuba nga naawe okimanyi.
I guess he did that	Ntebereza nti ekyo yakikola
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
I was going to go.	Nze nnali ngenda.
Maybe he wants to be a doctor now too.	Mpozzi naye kati ayagala kubeera musawo.
I'm you.	Nze ggwe.
I know it won’t help	Nkimanyi nti tekijja kuyamba
There are so many reasons.	Ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
I’m sure he did	Nkakasa nti yakikola
I'll be satisfied.	Nja kumala.
I have no idea what it is	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki
I need to address this	Kino nneetaaga okukola ku nsonga eno
Not for long, though.	Si lwa bbanga ddene, naye.
Like that was going to work.	Nga ekyo bwe kyali kigenda okukola.
He would have been a good father.	Yandibadde taata mulungi.
I hope that never happens again	Nsuubira nti ekyo tekijja kuddamu kubaawo
For everything and nothing.	Ku buli kimu era tewali kintu kyonna.
He really had no choice.	Mazima ddala yali talina kya kukola.
I wasn’t ready to talk	Nnali siri mwetegefu kwogera
This is not a police thing.	Kino si kintu kya poliisi.
I really have no problem.	Mazima ddala sirina buzibu.
Either you are, or you are not.	Oba oli, oba toli.
Now there is no waiting at all.	Kati tewali kulinda n’akatono.
Everyone does it.	Buli omu akikola.
I wasn’t going down there	Nze nali sigenda wansi eyo
Like at home.	Nga awaka.
I didn’t want to do those things.	Ebintu ebyo nnali saagala kukola.
I needed to talk to you	Nnali nneetaaga okwogera naawe
This is dangerous.	Kino kya bulabe.
I think you are absolutely fine	Ndowooza oli bulungi ddala
But with him.	Naye naye.
I hope you know that	Nsuubira ekyo okimanyi
It feels great to me.	Mpulira nnyo gyendi.
I had no idea he was so close behind me	Nnali simanyi nti yali kumpi nnyo emabega wange
I just live here.	Nze mbeera wano kyokka.
I had nothing to say	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera
And he seems to be doing a good job.	Era kirabika akola omulimu mulungi.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
That’s just a problem.	Ekyo kizibu kyokka.
Maybe more than we should.	Mpozzi okusinga bwe tusaanidde.
But it was the case.	Naye bwe kyali.
I don’t know if that’s true.	Simanyi oba ekyo kituufu.
We have a guy.	Tulina ggaayi.
I knew it was true as well	Namanya nti kituufu nga ye
I can't see.	Sisobola kulaba.
They certainly are.	Mazima ddala bwe bali.
She got all the help we needed.	Yafuna obuyambi bwonna bwe twetaaga.
And herein lies the problem.	Era wano we wali obuzibu.
I got lucky today.	Nfunye omukisa leero.
I don’t want to be alone with him	Saagala kubeera naye nzekka
This is not easy.	Kino si kyangu.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Simanyi kya kukola, ddala.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
He just loves it here.	Ayagala nnyo wano kyokka.
Everything seems so normal.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kya bulijjo nnyo.
He has to do it.	Alina okukikola.
I can do much better.	Nsobola okukola obulungi ennyo.
What is going to happen?.	Kiki ekigenda okubaawo?.
It would actually be worse.	Mu butuufu kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
But no one knows for sure.	Naye tewali amanyi bulungi.
I am very curious	Njagala nnyo okumanya
That’s a lot right now.	Ebyo bingi nnyo mu kiseera kino.
I have no idea what the problem is	Sirina kye mmanyi ku buzibu bwe buli
He will do very well.	Ajja kukola bulungi nnyo.
I feel like I have this right now.	Mpulira nga nnina kino mu kiseera kino.
We’re not going anywhere.	Tetulina gye tugenda.
I guess he’s in his office	Ntebereza nti ali mu ofiisi ye
I’ve been thinking a lot	Mbadde ndowooza nnyo
I live here now.	Nze mbeera wano kati.
There is no good there.	Tewali bulungi awo.
Perhaps this is true.	Oboolyawo kino kituufu.
We can’t live together.	Tetusobola kubeera wamu.
It doesn’t matter how or why.	Si kikulu ngeri ki oba lwaki.
I know you are, obviously you are	Nkimanyi nti oli, kya lwatu nti oli
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
Everyone will know.	Buli omu ajja kumanya.
You’ll be fine here.	Ojja kuba bulungi wano.
It was a beautiful place, though.	Kyokka kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
That’s when he felt better.	Wano we yawulira obulungi.
You have to do the work yourself.	Omulimu ggwe kennyini olina okukola.
I want to see something very soon	Njagala okulaba ekintu mu bbanga ttono ddala
I don’t know if it is.	Simanyi oba bwe kiri.
Doing so is very easy.	Okukola ekyo kyangu nnyo.
He knew what he wanted.	Yali amanyi kye yali ayagala.
I had nothing	Nnali sirina kintu kyonna
He wanted that too.	Ekyo naye yali ayagala nnyo.
He had the power.	Yalina amaanyi.
He went to many parties.	Yagenda ku mbaga nnyingi.
I want to be with him all the time	Njagala kubeera naye buli kiseera
I wondered what he was thinking	Nneebuuza kye yali alowooza
I have no problem with the police	Sirina buzibu bwonna ne poliisi
That's why I'm here.	Y'ensonga lwaki ndi wano.
I think it was close	Ndowooza kyali kumpi
I was just there.	Nze nnali awo kyokka.
Now it had it.	Kati kyalina.
I really didn’t know anything though	Mazima ddala nali sirina kye mmanyi wadde
It’s just not true.	Si kituufu kyokka.
I was thinking positively	Nze nnali ndowooza bulungi
This isn’t a bad thing.	Kino si kibi.
He had to buy some time.	Yalina okugula akaseera.
I know someone who can help	Nze mmanyi omuntu asobola okuyamba
Whatever it is you want.	Kyonna kye kiri kyoyagala.
I think he should have done	Ndowooza yandibadde akola
Maybe nothing will happen.	Mpozzi tewali kijja kubaawo.
No one knew what to say.	Tewali yali amanyi kya kwogera.
Now he’s the one.	Kati y’ali.
He says you look sick.	Agamba nti olabika mulwadde.
No one has a chance to do that.	Tewali muntu yenna alina mukisa kukola ekyo.
I wasn’t sure about what, but it was real.	Nnali sikakasa ku kiki, naye kyali kya ddala.
View of the house.	Okulaba ennyumba.
He won’t say anything.	Tajja kwogera kintu kyonna.
But it was very important.	Naye kyali kikulu nnyo.
I couldn’t keep going	Nnali sisobola kusigala nga ngenda mu maaso
I don’t want to go down there.	Saagala kugenda wansi eyo.
I think he really likes it here.	Ndowooza ddala ayagala nnyo wano.
It was one of those.	Kyali kimu ku ebyo.
We can’t go, we can’t do anything .	Tetusobola kugenda, tetusobola kukola kintu kyonna .
I couldn’t do anything.	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
No patient experienced any adverse events.	Tewali mulwadde yenna yafuna buzibu bwonna.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
It was a wonderful plan.	Yali nteekateeka nnungi nnyo.
Not that he was leaving.	Si nti yali agenda.
I know he wants to go home.	Nkimanyi ayagala kudda waka.
Really.	Kituufu.
That’s exactly what we are.	Ddala bwe tuli.
And you will tonight.	Era ojja kukikola ekiro kino.
You are sure you have.	Okakasa nti olina.
Maybe it’s true.	Mpozzi nga kituufu.
In fact, I am that person.	Mu butuufu, nze omuntu oyo.
However, I must act quickly	Kyokka nnina okukola amangu
I have no idea why he wanted a child	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki yali ayagala mwana
I had no idea where this was going to go	Kino nnali simanyi gye kyali kigenda kugenda
However, who knows.	Kyokka ani amanyi.
It clearly isn’t.	Kirabika bulungi si bwe kiri.
He did really well.	Yakola bulungi ddala.
Very early in the morning.	Nga bukyali nnyo.
I wasn’t at all sure what was going to happen	Nnali sikakasa n’akatono kiki ekigenda okubaawo
Maybe you have too.	Mpozzi naawe olina.
I love my job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwange.
He knows it himself.	Ye kennyini akimanyi.
I couldn’t eat at this point	Nnali sisobola kulya mu kiseera kino
I guess he didn’t want to know	Ntebereza nti yali tayagala kumanya
He couldn’t see anything.	Yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
As with healthy eating.	Nga bwe kiri ku kulya obulungi.
I wanted to see what would happen	Nnali njagala okulaba ekigenda okubaawo
It is a powerful place.	Kifo kya maanyi.
He did that very well.	Ekyo yakikola bulungi nnyo.
That’s where I was.	Awo we nnali.
Nothing, nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna, tewali kintu kyonna.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
One.	Emu.
I want to stay here for a while	Njagala kusigala wano okumala akaseera
I'll be back in about an hour.	Nja kudda mu ssaawa nga emu.
In the position.	Mu kifo.
But no one was ready at the time.	Naye mu kiseera ekyo tewali yali mwetegefu.
He really thinks so.	Ddala alowooza bw’atyo.
Surely he knew we were coming.	Mazima yali akimanyi nti tujja.
I hope that’s not too hard	Nsuubira nti ekyo si kizibu nnyo
It doesn’t matter who.	Si kikulu ani.
That was the plan.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka.
I really had nothing to do	Mazima ddala nnali sirina kye nkola
He knew something was going to happen.	Yali akimanyi nti waliwo ekigenda okubaawo.
You’re in the hospital.	Oli mu ddwaaliro.
Actually this is not true.	Mu butuufu kino si kituufu.
I can’t see what it is	Sisobola kulaba kye kiri
You are a good man.	Oli musajja mulungi.
He wanted so much more.	Yali ayagala bingi nnyo.
He was younger than her.	Yali muto okusinga ye.
You being in this.	Ggwe okubeera mu kino.
I really really need to have this	Nze ddala nneetaaga nnyo okuba ne kino
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
I think we can beat anyone	Ndowooza tusobola okukuba omuntu yenna
I want that too.	Nze nange njagala eyo.
So far, so far.	N’okutuusa kati.
I knew he wanted to come	Namanya nti ayagala kujja
I feel it too.	Nange mpulira.
For this, as.	Ku kino, nga.
Here he comes, he said.	Wano ajja, bwe yagambye.
I need to go all out with this	Nze nneetaaga okugenda byonna ne kino
And one of his car.	Era emu ya mmotoka ye.
No one really knew what was going on.	Tewali yali amanyi ddala kigenda mu maaso.
I didn’t want to work	Nnali saagala kukola
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
I thought for a moment	Nalowooza okumala akaseera
Just something, maybe.	Ekintu kyokka, mpozzi.
That is the reality for me.	Ekyo kye kya ddala gyendi.
I needed to talk to him	Nnali nneetaaga okwogera naye
Nothing in return.	Tewali kintu kyonna mu kuddamu.
I have it.	Nze nnina.
It just looks good	Kirabika bulungi kyokka
It’s not what it seems.	Si kye kirabika.
This is not maybe, this is true.	Kino si mpozzi, kino kituufu.
And you know obviously that was real.	Era omanyi kya lwatu nti ekyo kyali ddala.
I just wanted to.	Nze nnali njagala kyokka.
You can work hard.	Osobola okukola ennyo.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
It’s hard to see those things.	Kizibu okulaba ebintu ebyo.
That seems to be the case.	Ekyo kirabika nga bwe kiri.
He could never do that again.	Ekyo yali tasobola kuddamu kukikola.
We need to know where we are.	Tulina okumanya gye tuli.
No one has to know.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kumanya.
I'll go with him tonight	Nja kugenda naye ekiro kino
Not so far.	Si okutuuka wano.
And you know what, that's good.	Era omanyi kiki, ekyo kirungi.
But you know, maybe there’s something there, too.	Naye omanyi, mpozzi waliwo ekintu awo, era.
Not much, but not too much.	Si nnyo, naye si bingi nnyo.
I know nothing about this	Nze sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eno
It’s really nice.	Ddala kirungi.
The point is, this is who we are.	Ensonga eri nti, kino kye tuli.
I can’t even talk to anyone.	Sisobola na kwogera na muntu yenna.
He has a plan.	Alina enteekateeka.
Now he couldn’t do it.	Kati yali tasobola kukikola.
He didn’t have to speak.	Yali talina kwogera.
And yet it was there.	Era naye nga kyali awo.
I thought you were my best friend	Nalowooza nti ggwe mukwano gwange asinga
And I need to do it.	Era nneetaaga okukikola.
He looks young.	Alabika nga muto.
I am not in a bad place.	Siri mu kifo kibi.
This was a dangerous place.	Kino kyali kifo kya bulabe.
I know nothing but.	Tewali kye mmanyi okuggyako.
I'm glad he's here.	Ndi musanyufu nti ali wano.
I've been thinking for a while	Mbadde ndowooza okumala akaseera
In fact, you can.	Mu butuufu, osobola.
I could have gone.	Nnali nsobola okugenda.
It won’t and never will.	Tekijja kubaawo era tekijja kubaawo.
I won’t be home tonight	Sijja kudda waka ekiro kino
This can happen to any of us.	Kino kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna ku ffe.
I'll talk to him.	Nja kwogera naye.
I want to be a doctor	Njagala kubeera musawo
It’s not just any idea.	Si kirowoozo kyonna kyokka.
I have to get back to work.	Nnina okudda ku mulimu.
It was really bad for me.	Ddala kyali kibi nnyo gyendi.
But he didn’t really want to.	Naye yali tayagala nnyo.
But he is still with us.	Naye akyali naffe.
Yet it is not .	Ye si bwe kiri .
No problem at the moment.	Tewali buzibu mu kiseera kino.
I really didn’t know what was going on	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kigenda mu maaso
I don’t think this is true	Kino sirowooza nti kituufu
He did the same thing.	Yakola ekintu kye kimu.
If only we were in a hurry.	Singa twali mu bwangu.
Be.	Okubeera.
Not like me.	Si nga nze.
And yes, he knows it.	Era ye, akimanyi.
This is a great idea.	Kino kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
It is up to us to win.	Kiri eri ffe okuwangula.
We have you now.	Tulina ggwe kati.
I couldn’t do anything about it	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo
His wife is here with him.	Mukyala we ali naye wano.
Someone he could easily get to do what he wanted.	Omuntu gwe yali asobola bulungi okufuna okukola ky’ayagala.
Both were both, or neither.	Bombi baali bombi, oba nga tewali.
I really wanted to go	Nnali njagala nnyo okugenda
I think it’s dangerous now	Ndowooza kati kya bulabe
You are a true friend.	Oli mukwano gwa ddala.
You're not a guy.	Si ggaayi.
I didn’t want to go.	Nnali saagala kugenda.
This seems to be crucial for this problem.	Kino kirabika nga kikulu nnyo eri ekizibu kino.
I think he would like it	Ndowooza yandiyagadde
I wonder if that was too good to be true	Nneebuuza oba ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo
I'm aware of it.	Nze nkimanyi.
But he doesn’t think so.	Naye talowooza bw’atyo.
Indeed, he was.	Ddala, yali.
Surely you are.	Mazima ddala ggwe oli.
I’m pretty sure	Nze nkakasa nnyo
Now I was feeling a little sick	Kati nnali mpulira nga ndi mulwadde katono
I love having you here	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe wano
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
You really do the book.	Ddala ggwe okola ekitabo.
I’m not entirely sure	Sikakasa ddala
Maybe he should have.	Mpozzi yandibadde alina.
I thought my father was a good man	Nalowooza nti taata musajja mulungi
For him, that was fine.	Ku ye, ekyo kyali kirungi.
I was just the same.	Nze nali kye kimu kyokka.
It’s my luck.	Gwe mukisa gwange.
Be.	Okubeera.
I feel very comfortable in my room	Mpulira bulungi nnyo mu kisenge kyange
And there are things we can do.	Era waliwo ebintu bye tusobola okukola.
Maybe no one.	Mpozzi nga tewali muntu yenna.
I had no idea how difficult it would be	Nnali simanyi ngeri gye kyandibadde ekizibu
This was not what he needed.	Kino si kye yali yeetaaga.
I wasn’t even sure he would ever go home again	Nali sikakasa na nti ajja kuddamu okudda eka
I hope you don’t mind	Nsuubira nti tolina buzibu
If this were true.	Singa kino kyali kituufu.
Too soon to do something.	Amangu ennyo okukola ekintu.
This is my house.	Eno ennyumba yange.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
That doesn’t really matter.	Ekyo si kikulu nnyo.
Very true, too.	Kituufu nnyo, era.
I thought it wasn’t.	Nnalowooza nti si bwe kiri.
And that’s not a bad thing.	Era ekyo si kibi.
He was and still is my friend.	Yali mukwano gwange era akyali mukwano gwange.
Maybe it will come back.	Mpozzi kijja kudda.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Naye si kintu kibi.
But nobody does that.	Naye tewali akola ekyo.
I was just wondering about something	Nze nnali nneebuuza kyokka ku kintu
Like, you can’t even talk about it.	Nga, tosobola na kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
I wonder where we are	Nneebuuza gye tuli
He was afraid now.	Yali atya kati.
He was very good at his job.	Yali mulungi nnyo mu mulimu gwe.
I have to go to work immediately	Nnina okugenda ku mulimu mu bwangu
This is what it is.	Kino kye kiri.
It could be anyone.	Kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
I thought it was time to go home	Nalowooza nti kye kiseera okudda eka
He knew where.	Yali amanyi wa.
It’s hard to do.	Kizibu okukola.
I have so much time yet	Nnina obudde bungi nnyo n’okutuusa kati
I couldn’t do that	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola
Obviously not.	Kya lwatu si bwe kiri.
To him.	Eri ye.
And that’s my point, actually.	Era eyo y’ensonga yange, mu butuufu.
I want to talk about us	Njagala kwogera ku ffe
But not with you, or, not really with you.	Naye si naawe, oba, si naawe ddala.
I want to go home, she thought.	Njagala kudda waka, bwe yalowooza.
You’re the best.	Ggwe asinga.
But this is easier said than done.	Naye kino kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
You don’t have to do it.	Tolina kukikola.
Now I was alone.	Kati nnali nze nzekka.
I don’t think that’s true	Sirowooza nti ekyo mazima
I am everywhere and nowhere	Nze ndi buli wamu era sirina we
Not very good, either.	Si kirungi nnyo, era.
I could do with this	Nnali nsobola okukola ne kino
He was obviously down on his luck.	Kya lwatu nti yali wansi ku mukisa gwe.
I think he knows that	Ndowooza ekyo akimanyi
Really, just one.	Ddala, omu yekka.
I’m not just one player.	Siri muzannyi omu yekka.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
I couldn’t live with him	Nnali sisobola kubeera naye
That doesn’t seem to be true.	Ekyo kirabika si kituufu.
It could be him.	Kiyinza okuba nga ye.
That was exactly what it was.	Ekyo ddala bwe kyali.
I was the only guy there	Nze nzekka gwe nnali ggaayi eyo
Of course, everyone did it in their own ways.	Kya lwatu nti buli omu yakikola mu ngeri ze.
I think that would be great	Ndowooza ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo
It’s going to happen.	Kigenda kubeerawo.
His book is important.	Ekitabo kye kikulu.
I’ve been here before.	Nze mbadde wano emabegako.
It is and it is not.	Kiri era si bwe kiri.
I might be working at home myself	Nze kennyini nnyinza okuba nga nkola awaka
I didn’t know at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi
I had been busy.	Nnali mbadde bbize.
Obviously we will.	Kya lwatu nti tujja kukikola.
I want to be a real dad	Njagala kubeera taata ddala
I thought about it a lot	Nalowooza nnyo ku nsonga eyo
It won’t help.	Tekijja kuyamba.
No one has been talking about this.	Tewali abadde ayogera ku nsonga eno.
I have a lot to do tomorrow	Nnina bingi bye nkola enkya
I might be able to.	Nnyinza okuba nga nsobola.
It would be good for us.	Kyandibadde kirungi gye tuli.
I can’t believe it’s mine	Siyinza kukkiriza nti wange
It will be better this way.	Kijja kuba kirungi mu ngeri eno.
I can’t really say what it is	Mu butuufu sisobola kwogera kye kiri
Not as it is now.	Si nga bwe kiri kati.
Who.	Ani.
I was alone with myself	Nali nzekka nange kennyini
I can’t even find a friend	Sisobola na kufuna mukwano
You're his.	Oli wa ye.
He goes on and on.	Agenda mu maaso.
I guess this was a bad idea	Ntebereza nti kino kyali kirowoozo kibi
You will go to the police.	Ojja kugenda ku poliisi.
I should have said he already had one	Nnali nsaanidde okugamba nti yalina dda emu
I just want something simple	Njagala kintu kyangu kyokka
I already knew what was going down	Namanya dda ekigenda wansi
Now everything goes.	Kati buli kimu kigenda.
You don’t have to, either.	Tolina, nedda.
That’s what I want, too.	Ekyo nange njagala.
It was.	Yali.
But no one says that.	Naye tewali ayogera bw’atyo.
I’m going, of course.	Ngenda, ddala.
I think that was the point	Ndowooza eyo ye yali ensonga
I knew better, of course.	Nze nnali mmanyi bulungi, ddala.
I wanted to go to school	Nnali njagala kugenda ku ssomero
I’ve got the time.	Nfunye obudde.
I guess it’s the same	Ntebereza nti naye kye kimu
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
Beauty is in everyone.	Obulungi buli mu buli muntu.
I’m in the office.	Ndi ku ofiisi.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
Being a human being.	Okubeera omuntu.
I was very sick.	Nnali mulwadde nnyo.
I love his stuff.	Njagala nnyo ebintu bye.
And she can’t find a man.	Era tasobola kufuna musajja.
He certainly won’t come.	Mazima ddala tajja kujja.
I had no idea you could do this.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo nti kino osobola okukikola.
I need to know the things he said	Nnina okumanya ebintu bye yayogera
He didn't want to answer.	Yali tayagala kuddamu.
I want to work.	Njagala kukola.
Now, however, it is very difficult.	Kyokka kati kizibu nnyo.
I needed to know what he wanted	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya kye yali ayagala
It seems like all I know so far.	Kirabika kye mmanyi okutuuka wano.
I just need to be with you	Nze nneetaaga kubeera naawe kyokka
No, he didn't want to talk.	Nedda, yali tayagala kwogera.
I love working with you	Njagala nnyo okukola naawe
Good.	Kirungi.
He went ahead himself.	Ye kennyini yagenda mu maaso.
I have interests too, you know	Nze nange nnina bye njagala, omanyi
We must not allow this to happen.	Kino tetulina kukkiriza kubaawo.
Each of us.	Buli omu ku ffe.
As far as I know.	Nga bwe mmanyi.
I wasn’t quite sure	Nnali sikakasa bulungi
I am so glad you are here with me	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti oli wano nange
How do you do ?.	Okola otya ?.
This may be the case with you.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga naawe.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
He should have known better, of course.	Yandibadde amanyi bulungi, ddala.
And we don’t have anything.	Era tetulina kye tulina.
He will love you and you alone.	Ajja kwagala ggwe era ggwe wekka.
And it’s not just mine.	Era si kyange kyokka.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I was anything but, really	Nali kintu kyonna naye, ddala
I know everyone wants to know	Nkimanyi buli omu ayagala okumanya
There is no place for that.	Ekyo tewali kifo kyonna.
This is going to be bad.	Kino kigenda kuba kibi.
It won’t be as real.	Tekijja kuba kya ddala nga bwe kiri.
Nothing was going to happen tonight, he thought.	Tewali kyali kigenda kubaawo ekiro kino, bwe yalowooza.
I can’t have a better friend than you	Siyinza kufuna mukwano gwange asinga ggwe
Maybe it was too good.	Mpozzi nga kyali kirungi nnyo.
He could do that.	Ekyo yali asobola okukola.
That's why he won't be back.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tajja kudda.
He knew better than to say anything.	Yali amanyi bulungi okusinga okwogera ekintu kyonna.
We are, too.	Naffe tuli.
It’s really close.	Kiri kumpi ddala.
I've been here for a while	Mbadde wano okumala akaseera
I hope he has finished speaking	Nsuubira nti amaze okwogera
Why it doesn’t matter.	Ensonga lwaki si kikulu.
My father is not like that.	Taata wange si bwatyo.
My brother is.	Muganda wange ye.
This is a very serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I love his personality.	Njagala nnyo engeri ye.
We need a phone .	Twetaaga essimu .
I don’t want to talk about this	Kino saagala kwogera ku nsonga eno
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
I thought everything would be fine	Nalowooza nti buli kimu kyandibadde kirungi
Ku ku ku.	Ku ku ku.
I thought he felt the same way	Nalowooza nti naye yawulira bw’atyo
I can’t do this	Kino sisobola kukikola
As he was.	Nga bwe yali.
An issue he couldn’t do anything to help.	Ensonga gye yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna kuyamba.
I’m going to do this thing	Ekintu kino ngenda kukikola
You have one too.	Naawe olina emu.
But this alone is not true.	Naye kino kyokka si kye kituufu.
I want to come back with you.	Njagala okudda naawe.
I am a good man. 	Ndi musajja mulungi. 
there is no luck.	tewali mukisa.
We were friends, you know.	Twali ba mukwano, omanyi.
I’m so scared.	Nze ntya nnyo.
He was finished.	Yali amaze.
He still didn’t know everyone.	N’okutuusa kati yali tannaba kumanya buli muntu.
But it doesn’t matter, really.	Naye si kikulu, ddala.
Everything is the same thing.	Buli kintu kimu.
I think he's a little younger	Ndowooza muto katono
Even for myself.	Ne ku nze kennyini.
However, he could do about it.	Kyokka, yali asobola okukikola ku nsonga eyo.
I can't 'believe he did something like that.	Siyinza 'kukkiriza nti yakola ekintu ng'ekyo.
He is there now.	Ali awo kati.
But, he was very, very good.	Naye, yali mulungi nnyo nnyo.
He thinks he knows everything.	Alowooza nti buli kimu akimanyi.
We have to reimagine that.	Ekyo tulina okuddamu okukuba ekifaananyi.
I’m going to stay here	Ngenda kusigala wano
He knew what he wanted.	Yali amanyi kye yali ayagala.
I'm sure he's asleep now	Nkakasa kati yeebase
I knew where he was headed	Namanya gye yali ayolekedde
He thought he was there, three cars behind.	Yalowooza nti yali awo, mmotoka ssatu emabega.
I should have seen something.	Nnali nsaanidde okulaba ekintu.
It’s not too bad.	Si kibi nnyo.
I feel better now.	Mpulira bulungi kati.
I need to talk to you.	Nnina okwogera naawe.
I want someone who can talk to me	Njagala asobola okwogera nange
He really had to think about what he was doing.	Mazima ddala yalina okulowooza ku kye yali akola.
That’s coming.	Ekyo kijja.
It’s the same on each side.	Kye kimu ku buli ludda.
This is the reason why.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki.
You can’t be him.	Tosobola kubeera ye.
I can’t do that yet.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola n’okutuusa kati.
It was a job he loved.	Omulimu gwe yali ayagala nnyo.
We are here to work.	Tuli wano okukola.
I think he’s going to be fine	Ndowooza agenda kuba bulungi
He was my best friend.	Yali mukwano gwange nnyo.
I had absolutely nothing	Nnali sirina kintu kyonna ddala
I have been here ever since	Mbadde wano okuva mu kiseera ekyo
No one wanted to.	Tewali yali ayagala.
He was very in love.	Yali mu mukwano nnyo.
We just can’t.	Ffe tetusobola kyokka.
I didn’t really care	Nnali sifaayo nnyo
I really wanted to get home	Nnali njagala nnyo okutuuka awaka
The way it’s going.	Engeri gye kigenda mu maaso.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
I knew this was my chance	Namanya nti guno gwe mukisa gwange
Everyone will know.	Buli omu ajja kumanya.
He said he would wait.	Yagambye nti agenda kulinda.
We have to get out of here.	Tulina okuva wano.
That’s the one.	Oyo y’ali.
What he wants to do.	Kye ayagala okukola.
Perhaps he said something.	Oboolyawo yalina kye yayogera.
I didn’t know that father	Taata oyo nnali simanyi
I think this is it.	Ndowooza kino kye kiri.
But he knew it was his job.	Naye yali akimanyi nti gwe mulimu gwe.
I am really sick.	Nze ddala ndi mulwadde.
He had nothing.	Yali talina ky’alina.
But perhaps this is too easy.	Naye mpozzi kino kyangu nnyo.
It’s not a place you want to be.	Si kifo ky’oyagala okubeera.
I know that everything is right	Nkimanyi nti buli kigenda mu maaso kituufu
But that’s a problem.	Naye ekyo kizibu.
I wish it was, but it’s not.	Njagala bwe kyali, naye si bwe kiri.
It won’t be easy.	Tekijja kuba kyangu.
I didn’t want to know	Nnali saagala kumanya
No one is too happy about it.	Tewali musanyufu nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
Now, everybody knows everybody and it’s very difficult.	Kati, buli muntu amanyi buli muntu era kizibu nnyo.
He knows it.	Akimanyi.
I knew he wanted to go home	Namanya nti yali ayagala nnyo okudda eka
I will never do it again	Sijja kuddamu kukikola
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
He thought it was good.	Yalowooza nti kirungi.
I knew it and he knew it.	Nali nkimanyi era naye yali akimanyi.
Not from you.	Si okuva gy’oli.
I knew you would be good	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kuba mulungi
He knows he said too much.	Akimanyi nti yayogera bingi nnyo.
And it was pretty cool.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo.
But we shall see .	Naye tujja kulaba .
I need some help	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi
That was my plan, too.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka yange, nange.
That is very dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe nnyo.
He had to go.	Yalina okugenda.
It can do it.	Kiyinza okukikola.
It could be in the car.	Kiyinza okuba nga kiri mu mmotoka.
This is very easy to do.	Kino kyangu nnyo okukola.
And neither is it with you.	Era naawe si bwe kiri.
He said he would be in.	Yagambye nti ajja kuba mu.
He didn’t want his favorite job.	Yali tayagala mulimu gwe yali ayagala ennyo.
It’s hard for me to go anywhere.	Kizibu gyendi okugenda yonna.
A little while ago, maybe	Akaseera katono emabega, mpozzi
It’s easy, but not very helpful.	Kyangu, naye si kya kuyamba nnyo.
I guess that was good for them	Ntebereza ekyo kyali kirungi gye bali
We don’t have anything.	Tetulina kintu kyonna kye tulina.
While there .	Nga bali eyo .
I didn’t know how to respond	Nnali simanyi ngeri ya kuddamu
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
But he didn’t have it.	Naye nga talina.
I am a doctor you know	Ndi musawo omanyi
I know you have it in you	Nkimanyi nti olina mu ggwe
She loved her house.	Yali ayagala nnyo ennyumba ye.
I knew it would be very difficult	Namanya nti kijja kuba kizibu nnyo
It’s a very good thing.	Kintu kirungi nnyo.
Not the way he had it before.	Si ngeri gye yalina emabegako.
I don’t know why he did that.	Simanyi lwaki yakola bw’atyo.
But I don’t think so.	Naye nze si kituufu.
I knew nothing about him	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye
And right now is not the time.	Era mu kiseera kino si kye kiseera.
I won’t believe it.	Sijja kukkiriza.
No one spoke to him.	Tewali yayogera naye.
I have no real idea what to expect.	Sirina kirowoozo kya ddala kye nsuubira.
I thought then that you are not quite yourself	Nalowooza awo nti toli ggwe kennyini ddala
Obviously it won’t work for everyone.	Kya lwatu tekijja kukola ku buli muntu.
One thing at a time my friend.	Ekintu kimu ku kimu mukwano gwange.
I hear you.	Mpulira.
He is currently still in the hospital.	Mu kiseera kino akyali mu ddwaaliro.
And it wasn’t what he wanted either.	Era naye si kye yali ayagala.
It is very dangerous for us.	Kya bulabe nnyo gye tuli.
And he didn’t want that.	Era ekyo yali tayagala.
And it’s not just any idea.	Era si kirowoozo kyonna kyokka.
Now I don’t want to	Kati saagala
I can’t do it faster than that	Sisobola kukikola mu bwangu okusinga ekyo
You don’t want to do that.	Ekyo toyagala kukikola.
But someone else has to do it.	Naye omuntu omulala alina okukikola.
I want her herself	Njagala ye kennyini
Poor performance.	Obutakola bulungi.
No, it wasn’t.	Nedda, si bwe yali.
I still can’t wait to talk to you every day	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kulinda kwogera naawe buli lunaku
But he was no good at it.	Naye yali talina mulungi mu nsonga eyo.
He was the one who started it.	Ye ye yatandika.
Both are fine.	Bombi bali bulungi.
Maybe he had to.	Mpozzi nga yalina okukikola.
It would certainly be one of us	Mazima ddala kyandibadde kimu ku ffe
I know this.	Kino nkimanyi.
You can see it.	Osobola okulaba.
I’m going to see what we can do	Ngenda kulaba kye tusobola okukola
He had no idea, really, what it was.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna, ddala, kiki kye kyali.
I didn’t know he would be coming	Nnali simanyi nti ajja kuba ajja
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
I need to go home for a little while	Nze nneetaaga okudda eka akaseera katono
You have me'	Olina nze'.
He doesn’t even have one.	Talina wadde.
Something my father must have loved.	Kintu taata ateekwa okuba nga yali ayagala nnyo.
He was supposed to be my friend.	Yali alina okuba mukwano gwange.
It’s there or it’s not.	Kiri awo oba si bwe kiri.
It was everything.	Kyali buli kimu.
I'm asking for help.	Nze nsaba obuyambi.
I need to go to the hospital right now	Nze nneetaaga okugenda mu ddwaaliro mu kiseera kino
An hour ago, right now.	Essaawa emu emabega, mu kiseera kino.
But not today.	Naye si leero.
I’m not happy though.	Nze si musanyufu wadde.
But now face to face.	Naye kati maaso ku maaso.
I knew nothing myself	Nze kennyini nnali sirina kye mmanyi
It’s true with me.	Kituufu nange.
And this is something.	Era kino kintu.
There is nothing here.	Tewali kintu kyonna wano.
Everywhere now.	Buli wamu kati.
And you know what he said? 	Era omanyi kye yayogera?
. . . .	.
I know he would love to talk to you	Nkimanyi yandiyagadde nnyo okwogera naawe
That seems low.	Ekyo kirabika nga kya wansi.
He will be good for a little while.	Ajja kuba mulungi okumala akaseera katono.
I thought you were going to be there tonight	Nalowooza nti ogenda kubeerawo ekiro kino
I have to get to the office	Nnina okutuuka mu ofiisi
I thought you wanted more than that	Nalowooza nti oyagala okusinga ekyo
I wonder why he does this	Nze nneebuuza lwaki akola kino
In this case.	Mu mbeera eno.
I have nothing to fear.	Nze sirina kye ntya.
I was me, just me.	Nze nali nze, nze nzekka.
I wanted to know things	Nnali njagala okumanya ebintu
I'm going to try to find another one.	Ngenda kugezaako okufuna omulala.
In fact it is not.	Mu mazima si bwe kiri.
Not really though.	Si ddala wadde.
I would love to read about your perspective on school	Njagala nnyo okusoma ku ndowooza yo ku ssomero
I couldn’t really do it	Mu butuufu nnali sisobola kukikola
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
And now he is working.	Era kati akola.
Good, he said.	Kirungi, bwe yagambye.
I want luck like anyone else.	Njagala omukisa nga omuntu omulala yenna.
I hope everything goes well	Nsuubira nti buli kimu kigenda bulungi
Like a car.	Nga mmotoka.
I didn’t know how good it was	Nnali simanyi ngeri gye kyali kirungi
I can’t do that again	Ekyo sisobola kuddamu kukikola
He is still my father.	Akyali taata wange.
I was young at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali muto.
I want to talk about this.	Njagala kwogera ku nsonga eno.
Of course, he had no choice in the matter.	Kya lwatu nti yali talina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo.
In a sense.	Mu ngeri emu.
You know.	Omanyi.
However, I love doing it	Kyokka, njagala nnyo okukikola
Would love this house.	Ennyumba eno yandiyagadde nnyo.
I can’t believe this will happen again	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kino kijja kuddamu okubaawo
I need to see this movie again	Nze nneetaaga okuddamu okulaba firimu eno
I have the whole thing.	Nnina ekintu kyonna.
I love working alone	Njagala nnyo okukola nzekka
But either way, he had no choice.	Naye mu ngeri yonna, yali talina kya kukola.
It’s a common issue.	Ensonga ya bulijjo.
That's not an issue though.	Eyo si nsonga wadde.
That’s another kid.	Oyo mwana omulala.
This will be easier for you.	Kino kijja kuba kyangu gy’oli.
That alone was lucky.	Ekyo kyokka kye kyali kyali kya mukisa.
It was there.	Kyali awo.
I, myself, am helpless	Nze, nze kennyini, sirina kye nsobola kukola
But he knows it too.	Naye naye akimanyi.
It’s too bad for me.	Kibi nnyo gyendi.
Any father would be.	Taata yenna yandibadde.
And you know and there is.	Era omanyi era waliwo.
That’s what we have.	Oyo tulina.
Maybe not even then.	Mpozzi ne mu kiseera ekyo si bwe kiri.
No one has it.	Tewali alina.
He wants to get back to being a good man.	Ayagala kudda mu kubeera musajja mulungi.
That was certainly his opinion.	Mazima ddala eyo ye yali ndowooza ye.
I have to do it my way.	Nnina okukikola mu ngeri yange.
You know, you know.	Okimanyi, okimanyi.
I guess we’ll have to see	Ntebereza nti tujja kuba tulina okulaba
I think this is really true.	Ndowooza kino ddala kituufu.
It was a good plan.	Yali nteekateeka nnungi.
I didn’t want to talk	Nnali saagala kwogera
I don’t care right now.	Sifaayo mu kiseera kino.
It’s time to ride now.	Kye kiseera okuvuga kati.
I knew my father.	Taata nnali mmanyi.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
He is very young.	Muto nnyo.
It was time to go to work.	Kyali kiseera okugenda ku mulimu.
I didn’t know who he was at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi ani.
But they were lucky.	Naye baali ba mukisa.
I knew he could and would do that	Nnali nkimanyi nti ekyo asobola era agenda kukikola
He really didn't need to tell anyone now.	Mazima ddala yali teyeetaaga kubuulira muntu yenna kati.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
That was the process.	Eyo yali nkola.
Not bad.	Si kibi.
And it’s not just any problem.	Era si kizibu kyonna kyokka.
I wanted to talk to him	Nnali njagala okwogera naye
I was always curious	Bulijjo nnali njagala okumanya
I don’t know why not.	Simanyi lwaki nedda.
Only one of them.	Omu yekka.
I’m not sure what’s wrong with me being here.	Sikakasa kizibu kyange okubeera wano.
He has anything.	Alina ekintu kyonna.
Maybe you can.	Mpozzi osobola.
You have to do this thing.	Ekintu kino olina okukola.
He said he would do it.	Yagambye nti ajja kukikola.
It seems to be a good one.	Kirabika nga kirungi.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
But this is the crux of the matter.	Naye kino kye kikulu ennyo mu nsonga.
We can get nothing at all.	Tetulina kye tusobola kufuna n’akatono.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
You know where we have to go.	Omanyi gye tulina okugenda.
I think that’s what he was doing.	Ndowooza ekyo kye yali akola.
I want it here, too, like this	Njagala wano, nange, nga kino
Nothing too ordinary there.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo nnyo eyo.
I’ve been here before	Nze mbadde wano emabegako
In any case.	Mu mbeera yonna.
I think you’ll want to ride	Ndowooza ojja kwagala okuvuga
I was on to something	Nali ku kintu
That night was such a time.	Ekiro ekyo kyali kiseera ng’ekyo.
I really have to go now	Mazima ddala nnina okugenda kati
That’s not me.	Oyo si nze.
I want to go with you	Njagala kugenda naawe
Certainly not the police.	Mazima ddala si poliisi.
But he's really not well.	Naye ddala tali bulungi.
No one was talking.	Tewali yali ayogera.
I doubt he will come back	Nbuusabuusa nti ajja kudda
I just need a little time	Nze nneetaaga akaseera katono
It’s not just that.	Si kyokka.
I guess it will come back to me	Ntebereza nti kijja kudda gyendi
He has always been such a happy child.	Bulijjo abadde mwana musanyufu bw’atyo.
He may leave here.	Ayinza okuva wano.
That’s not a good practice.	Eyo si nkola nnungi.
Now you are ready to buy.	Kati oli mwetegefu okugula.
I didn’t know what was going on.	Nnali simanyi kigenda mu maaso.
I’m afraid it’s not much	Ntya nti si bingi
I can’t wait until tonight	Siyinza kulinda okutuusa ekiro kino
And it’s not even an issue.	Era si wadde ensonga.
No one here is willing to help.	Tewali muntu yenna wano mwetegefu kuyamba.
Which, of course, he is not.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, si ky’ali.
You know it.	Okimanyi.
I have no idea how to proceed	Sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso
I just needed to be there to help	Nnali nneetaaga kubeerawo kyokka okuyamba
I said you can’t.	Nagamba nti tosobola.
It is very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo.
This may be the case.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
I will tell my brother about it.	Nja kubuulira muganda wange ku nsonga eno.
But that would be a problem.	Naye ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
I’m not sure what week it went.	Sikakasa wiiki gye yagenda.
I needed it.	Nnali nneetaaga.
I wanted to know what was going on	Nnali njagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
This is very, very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo nnyo.
I was feeling very nervous	Nali mpulira nga ntya nnyo
Everything he loved.	Buli kintu kye yali ayagala ennyo.
And maybe that’s the point.	Era oboolyawo eyo y’ensonga.
I didn’t know he was young at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi nti yali muto
It will likely go one of three ways.	Kirabika kijja kugenda mu emu ku ngeri ssatu.
I need to talk to him	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye
He will be asleep.	Ajja kuba yeebase.
And the reason for that is.	Era ensonga lwaki ekyo kiri nti.
And everyone knows it.	Era buli omu akimanyi.
And we are very dangerous.	Era tuli ba bulabe nnyo.
I can’t even believe this.	Kino siyinza na kukkiriza.
You have to move on.	Olina okugenda mu maaso.
I couldn’t do it	Nnali sisobola kukikola
He is indeed the best.	Mazima ye asinga obulungi.
Everything is happening.	Buli kimu kigenda mu maaso.
I guess that was where my problem lay	Ntebereza nti awo ekizibu kyange we kyali
Apparently this is not the case.	Kirabika kino si bwe kiri.
You have to work hard.	Olina okukola ennyo.
We cannot know.	Tetusobola kumanya.
He must have had no choice.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali talina kya kukola.
He told me that.	Yang’amba bw’atyo.
He was normal, happy.	Yali wa bulijjo, nga musanyufu.
That’s a great idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
He knew it would come.	Yali akimanyi nti kijja kujja.
Now that’s not true.	Kati ekyo si kituufu.
Here and there, everywhere.	Wano ne wali, buli wamu.
You are so beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo.
No, actually, that’s not quite true.	Nedda, mu butuufu, ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
I'm glad you are.	Ndi musanyufu nti ggwe.
And what do you think?.	Era olowooza ki?.
He could see clearly now.	Yali asobola okulaba obulungi kati.
I didn’t know what time it was	Nnali simanyi ssaawa mmeka
Fact being, he did it before.	Ensonga nga bwe yali, yakikola emabegako.
I didn’t know anyone	Nnali simanyi muntu yenna
I really didn’t want to see or talk to anyone	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kulaba oba kwogera na muntu yenna
I wanted to know what he knew.	Nnali njagala okumanya kye yali amanyi.
Education is their priority.	Okusoma kye kikulu nnyo gye bali.
He was that strong.	Yali wa maanyi bw’atyo.
And he couldn’t either.	Era naye yali tasobola.
I was so happy to get home	Nnali musanyufu nnyo okutuuka awaka
I knew he was so much more than that	Namanya nti yali asinga nnyo ekyo
He would certainly like to talk about this.	Mazima ddala yandiyagadde okwogera ku kino.
I wonder what is going on	Nze nneebuuza ekigenda mu maaso
He won’t work.	Tajja kukola.
It was quick.	Yali ya mangu.
I just didn’t know about it	Nnali simanyi nsonga eyo kyokka
I need your opinion though	Nze nneetaaga endowooza yo wadde
I need to be with him right now.	Nze nneetaaga okubeera naye mu kiseera kino.
No, not the way he would have liked, but definitely the way he needed.	Nedda, si ngeri gye yandiyagadde, naye ddala engeri gye yali yeetaaga.
Or anyone else for that matter.	Oba omuntu omulala yenna ku nsonga eyo.
I can only imagine what it would be like now.	Nsobola okulowooza ku ngeri gye yandibadde kati.
I wish she was here now	Njagala yandibadde wano kati
I think it’s not where it should be though.	Ndowooza si we yandibadde wadde.
I knew what they were	Nnali mmanyi kye baali
There is nothing wrong with this.	Kino tewali kibi kyonna.
And it’s not easy.	Era si kyangu.
I knew he would be there	Namanya nti ajja kubeerawo
I couldn’t do something like that	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu ng’ekyo
And he did it.	Era yakikola.
I wonder what my father is doing	Nze nneebuuza taata akola ki
Or almost as well.	Oba kumpi bulungi nga bwe kiri.
You can do it.	Osobola okukola.
Everything he couldn’t say.	Buli kimu kye yali tasobola kwogera.
What had he been thinking.	Kiki kye yali abadde alowooza.
I couldn’t do that	Ekyo nnali siyinza kukikola
I know you know what’s going on	Nkimanyi nti omanyi ekigenda mu maaso
I can almost read the energy	Kumpi nsobola okusoma amaanyi
I didn’t really care.	Nnali sifaayo nnyo.
I just hope you have the same problem as we do.	Nsuubira kyokka nti olina obuzibu nga ffe.
The reason why.	Ensonga lwaki...
He went quickly.	Yagenda mu bwangu.
He was a lonely child.	Yali mwana ali yekka.
He has no power.	Talina maanyi.
What a great practice.	Nga nkola nnungi nnyo.
It was very much.	Yali nnyo.
It is here and now.	Kiri wano ne kati.
No, you can’t do that.	Nedda, ekyo tosobola kukikola.
I was making good time going to school	Nnali nkola obudde obulungi okugenda ku ssomero
I’m not sure if it’s true.	Sikakasa oba kituufu.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
I have to go with this	Nnina okugenda ne kino
I’m probably going to have more time to read.	Oboolyawo ngenda kufuna obudde bungi okusoma.
He does the same thing.	Akola ekintu kye kimu.
I think he probably will, actually.	Ndowooza osanga ajja kukikola, mu butuufu.
I am not a morning person.	Siri muntu wa makya.
But he couldn’t do that.	Naye ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
You know it well enough.	Okimanyi bulungi.
As we should be.	Nga bwe tusaanidde okuba.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
And that was that.	Era ekyo kye kyali ekyo.
It was very common.	Kyali kya bulijjo nnyo.
It was really good.	Ddala kyali kirungi.
Who does that.	Ani akola ekyo.
I don’t think that’s what’s happening.	Sirowooza nti ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso.
I’ll be fine, you’ll see	Nja kuba bulungi, ojja kulaba
He was speaking well	Yali ayogera bulungi
I know what’s going on here.	Nze mmanyi ekigenda mu maaso wano.
I’ve been busy already	Mbadde bbize dda
I didn’t know what to expect.	Nnali simanyi kye nnali nsuubira.
I'm leaving soon.	Ngenda mu bbanga ttono.
He really does.	Akola ddala.
I should do the same, he thought	Nange nsaanidde okukola kye kimu, bwe yalowooza
They're there.	Bali awo.
That was a good and bad time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kirungi era kibi.
You have to have this.	Olina okubeera ne kino.
But it was just a little bit.	Naye nga katono ddala.
I’ve got something.	Nze nfunye ekintu.
It would be much easier, too.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo, era.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
I have one like him	Nnina omu nga ye
I really didn’t want to be alone	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kubeera nzekka
For a long time he won’t answer.	Okumala ebbanga ddene tajja kuddamu.
But he can’t.	Naye ye tasobola.
I want to reach out to everyone	Njagala okutuuka ku buli muntu
Or almost none.	Oba kumpi tewali.
I need some alone time	Nze nneetaaga akaseera nga ndi nzekka
He would be at home.	Yandibadde waka.
It’s not a bad idea.	Si kirowoozo kibi.
I was almost back.	Nnali kumpi okudda.
You are a person like me.	Oli muntu nga nze.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
I just didn’t know what to do with it	Nze nnali simanyi kya kukikola
Help is easy.	Obuyambi bwangu.
Probably as it was.	Oboolyawo nga bwe kyali.
I knew exactly what it was	Nnali mmanyi bulungi kye kyali
There they are.	Eyo gye bali.
And on him.	Era ku ye.
I don’t have a job.	Nze sirina mulimu.
I can’t believe it	Siyinza kukkiriza
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
He is a very good player.	Muzannyi mulungi nnyo.
I have to do this myself	Kino nnina okukikola nzekka
You're not well.	Toli bulungi.
Please speak to my brother.	Nsaba okwogera ne muganda wange.
I can’t say anything	Siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna
It doesn’t matter, he said.	Si kikulu, bwe yagambye.
', and he '.	', era ye '.
Now I was in the hospital.	Kati nnali mu ddwaaliro.
All by myself.	Byonna nzekka.
It is obviously difficult.	Kya lwatu nti kizibu.
I was really looking forward to this	Kino nnali nsuubira nnyo
I need a job.	Omulimu nneetaaga.
It’s really up to you.	Ddala kiri gy’oli.
I said he should buy one	Nagamba nti alina okugula emu
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Mpozzi nga kirungi.
She is my wife.	Ye mukyala wange.
This is up to you.	Kino kiri ku ggwe.
I knew what you were doing	Nali mmanyi kye wali okola
There's a lot back there.	Waliwo bingi emabega awo.
I was so in love with it	Nnali njagala nnyo
I feel like it’s coming.	Mpulira nga kijja.
Everyone was ready to go fast.	Buli omu yali mwetegefu okugenda amangu.
Very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo, nnyo.
I wanted it on myself	Nnali njagala ku nze kennyini
Maybe he was telling the truth.	Mpozzi yali ayogera mazima.
I have a lot to read tonight	Nnina bingi bye njagala okusoma ekiro kino
He is not happy.	Si musanyufu.
Until next week!.	Okutuusa wiiki ejja!.
Maybe this will work.	Mpozzi kino kijja kukola.
I wish you were here	Njagala nnyo singa wali wano
Nothing is more important than that	Tewali kintu kikulu nnyo okusinga ekyo
Probably not true though.	Oboolyawo si kituufu wadde.
Nothing whatever.	Tewali kintu kyonna kintu kyonna.
He was very happy about that.	Ekyo yali musanyufu nnyo.
He saw the whole thing.	Yalaba ekintu kyonna.
I'm going to.	Nze ngenda ku...
I don’t know what to do in that situation.	Simanyi kya kukola mu mbeera eyo.
I didn’t even know what to say	Nnali simanyi na kya kwogera
I’m not sure where my father was	Sikakasa taata gye yali
I’m doing fine by myself.	Nze nkola bulungi nzekka.
And myself .	Era nze kennyini .
As beautiful as ever.	Nga bulungi nga bulijjo.
Who knows what he was thinking.	Ani amanyi kye yali alowooza.
And he .	Era ye .
He was a lot like me.	Yali nga nze nnyo.
I don’t know where it is.	Simanyi gye kiri.
I wanted to talk	Nnali njagala okwogera
I wonder if it always will	Nneebuuza oba bulijjo kijja kubaawo
And he knows it was just what he expected.	Era akimanyi nti kye yali asuubira yekka.
No, you don’t have to.	Nedda, tolina.
I want with everything of mine	Njagala ne buli kimu kyange
I know it in the past.	Nze nkimanyi emabega.
He was a young child.	Yali mwana muto.
He is knowledgeable and personable.	Alina okumanya era alina omuntu.
Whether he wants there or not.	Oba ayagala eyo oba nedda.
It’s as simple as that.	Kyangu nnyo nga ekyo.
It doesn't matter, he'll come on.	Si nsonga, ajja kujja ku.
I had no idea where I was going.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi gye nnali ngenda.
It goes into the house.	Kigenda mu nnyumba.
I pray it won’t happen	Nsaba tekijja kubaawo
I love this stuff.	Nze ebintu bino njagala nnyo.
It was to be like.	Yali okubeera nga.
I don’t think he would want to.	Sirowooza nti yandiyagadde.
There is only one problem.	Waliwo ekizibu kimu kyokka.
He has been having.	Abadde alina.
Perhaps this will help.	Oboolyawo kino kijja kuyamba.
I couldn’t go to school	Nnali sisobola kugenda ku ssomero
I should be one.	Nze nsaanidde okuba omu.
We are very close friends.	Tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
Very happy with this though.	Kino musanyufu nnyo wadde.
I didn’t know how to respond	Nali simanyi ngeri gye nnali nnyinza kuddamu
I’m fine without it.	Nze ndi bulungi nga tewali.
I wasn’t really sure though yet.	Nnali sikakasa ddala wadde n’okutuusa kati.
In the office.	Mu ofiisi.
I have a lot of it.	Nnina bingi.
It was a difficult reality.	Kyali kituufu ekizibu.
I wasn’t really sure who or even what	Mu butuufu nnali sikakasa ani oba wadde kiki
Money isn’t the issue.	Ssente si y’ensonga.
You can do it instead.	Osobola okukikola mu kifo kye.
We can talk.	Tusobola okwogera.
You don’t have to go anywhere without it.	Tolina kugenda yonna nga tolina.
I will always be early	Bulijjo nja kuba nga bukyali
I don’t have any plans.	Sirina nteekateeka yonna.
It will be good.	Kijja kuba kirungi.
Nobody said anything to me.	Tewali yangamba kintu kyonna.
I had no idea.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
I feel he is really good	Mpulira nti ddala mulungi
I needed to regain my strength	Nnali nneetaaga okuddamu okufuna amaanyi
He doesn’t have a problem.	Talina buzibu.
I was afraid of nothing	Nali ntya kintu kyonna
Maybe he should tell someone.	Oboolyawo alina okubuulira omuntu.
I could honestly imagine any scenario	Mu butuufu nnali nsobola okulowooza ku mbeera yonna
I guess you have to go	Ntebereza nti olina okugenda
I actually feel strong	Mu butuufu mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi
It is very difficult to do so.	Kizibu nnyo okukikola.
I am doing a job now that I love	Nkola omulimu kati gwe njagala
I will be alone.	Nja kuba nzekka.
I needed to work.	Nnali nneetaaga okukola.
I need to know what’s going on	Nnina okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
But it’s not my money.	Naye si ssente yange.
Not like himself.	Si nga ye kennyini.
But it will never happen again.	Naye tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
I have no idea why he is here	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki ali wano
He knew what it was.	Yali amanyi kye kyali.
I needed to know if	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya oba
You can.	Osobola.
He will do it soon.	Ajja kukikola mu bbanga ttono.
It’s not an ordinary relationship	Si mukwano gwa bulijjo
I still couldn’t see anything	N’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna
I really had no reason to be there	Mazima ddala nnali sirina nsonga yonna lwaki nnali nnyinza kubeerawo
Nothing is happening.	Tewali kigenda mu maaso.
He can talk.	Asobola okwogera.
I feel something too	Nze nange waliwo kye mpulira
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
It looks really real.	Kirabika ddala ddala.
I have three reasons	Nnina ensonga ssatu
And not in a good way, either.	Era si mu ngeri nnungi, era.
Where has he been.	Abadde ludda wa.
He could probably do it now.	Oboolyawo yali asobola okukikola kati.
I didn’t know he was her brother until now	Nali simanyi nti muganda we okutuusa kati
I think we have.	Ndowooza tulina.
There is nothing to do.	Tewali kya kukola.
But what's the problem! 	Naye kiki ekizibu!
I think we will do it	Ndowooza tujja kukikola
I really have trouble reading stuff like this	Mazima ddala nnina obuzibu okusoma ebintu nga bino
I'll find the time.	Nja kufuna obudde.
Home from home.	Awaka okuva awaka.
His dad lived and it seemed important.	Taata we yali abeera era nga kirabika nga kikulu.
It can work.	Kiyinza okukola.
I could live with that	Ekyo nnali nsobola okubeera naye
Everything is happening.	Buli kimu kigenda mu maaso.
That's who he had been.	Oyo gwe yali abadde.
I don’t want to go down again.	Saagala kuddamu kugenda wansi.
But for me, that’s not my problem.	Naye nze ekyo si kye kizibu kyange.
Maybe it’s true.	Mpozzi nga kituufu.
I could imagine that scenario.	Nnali nsobola okulowooza ku mbeera eyo.
He was better than that.	Yali asinga ekyo.
I'm at one o'clock.	Ndi ku ssaawa emu.
I couldn’t believe what he did	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza kye yakola
I wasn’t really sure.	Mu butuufu nnali sikakasa.
But he really did.	Naye ddala yakikola.
I might go home soon	Nnyinza okudda awaka amangu ddala
As a person.	Nga omuntu.
It’s neither good nor bad.	Si kirungi wadde kibi.
It had to be him.	Kyalina okuba nga ye.
He's probably fine.	Oboolyawo ali bulungi.
He was a very nice guy.	Yali ggaayi mulungi nnyo.
I think he's there now	Ndowooza kati ali awo
That's why he won't be back.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tajja kudda.
I knew exactly where I was going	Nnali mmanyi bulungi gye nnali ngenda okugenda
It’s not as true as we are.	Si kituufu nga ffe.
I think back to when it could have happened	Ndowooza okudda ku ddi lwe kyali kiyinza okubaawo
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Naye nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eyo.
I needed to know where he had been	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya gye yali abadde
He was as good or better than they were.	Yali mulungi oba okusinga bwe baali.
And then there they were.	Era awo we baali awo.
I thought he would be here	Nalowooza nti ajja kuba wano
I know that none of this is normal	Nkimanyi nti ku bino tewali na kimu kya bulijjo
He can do it.	Ayinza okukikola.
That’s what I’ve been doing	Ekyo mbadde nkola
Not just any guy.	Si ggaayi yenna yekka.
Making good time so far.	Okukola obudde obulungi okutuuka kati.
We’re both of us.	Ffe ffembi.
That’s all he said.	Ekyo kyokka kye yayogera.
I love being with him	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye
I loved everyone but myself	Nnali njagala nnyo buli muntu okuggyako nze kennyini
And of course, he was.	Era ddala, yali.
I don’t know if that’s a problem.	Simanyi oba ekyo kizibu.
And he was.	Era yali.
No, it was worse than that.	Nedda, kyali kibi okusinga ekyo.
No man could.	Tewali musajja yali asobola.
But it was going.	Naye kyali kigenda.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I know.	Mmanyi.
But nothing much.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna nnyo.
I really thought you were	Ddala nnalowooza nti ggwe
I live down below	Mbeera wansi wansi
Who else could it be.	Ani omulala ayinza okuba.
I think he’s doing really well	Ndowooza akola bulungi ddala
I want to stay with him	Njagala kusigala naye
I think he was talking about his girlfriend	Ndowooza yali ayogera ku muganzi we
I don’t know your situation	Simanyi mbeera yo
But to me.	Naye gyendi.
This is very unusual.	Kino si kya bulijjo nnyo.
I thought a lot.	Nalowooza nnyo.
Here it is now.	Wano bwe kiri kati.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
You don’t know how to do it right.	Tomanyi kukikola bulungi.
I want someone who loves my work	Njagala ayagala nnyo omulimu gwange
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
Previously, you were on your own schedule.	Emabegako, wali ku nteekateeka yo.
I will not allow it to happen	Sijja kukkiriza kubaawo
It was very, very good.	Kyali kirungi nnyo nnyo.
I know what it was now	Nze mmanyi kye kyali kati
Not in the same thing.	Si mu kintu kye kimu.
You are not real to them.	Ggwe toli wa ddala gye bali.
You can’t do it.	Tosobola kukikola.
I can’t wait to come again.	Siyinza kulinda kuddamu kujja.
I just know that he did	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti yakikola
I could do things	Nnali nsobola okukola ebintu
I just love that guy	Nze njagala nnyo ggaayi oyo yekka
I want everything now	Njagala buli kimu kati
That’s going to be very difficult.	Ekyo kigenda kuba kizibu nnyo.
You are like him.	Ggwe oli nga ye.
I know you know this.	Nkimanyi nti kino okimanyi.
You’ll see why shortly.	Ojja kulaba lwaki mu bbanga ttono.
From this.	Okuva mu kino.
That’s what it is, of course.	Ekyo kye kiri, ddala.
Maybe that’s the same thing.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kimu.
You know what he wanted.	Omanyi kye yali ayagala.
It’s easy to do.	Kyangu okukola.
I wasn’t going to win that one	Oyo nnali sigenda kuwangula
I was expecting something much more complicated than this	Nali nsuubira ekintu ekizibu ennyo okusinga kino
I thought that was a no no.	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyali nedda nedda.
And then there you are.	Era awo waliwo ggwe.
I don’t think it is.	Sirowooza nti bwe kiri.
I wanted to be like him	Nnali njagala kubeera nga ye
I wonder who that could be	Nze nneebuuza ani oyo ayinza okuba nga ye
He says he is at home.	Agamba nti ali waka.
He was in a hurry.	Yali mu bwangu.
I don’t want to say anything	Saagala kwogera kintu kyonna
This is a difficult place.	Kino kifo kizibu.
Something about that.	Ekintu ku ekyo.
It will be something like below.	Kijja kuba kintu nga wansi.
He didn't know what time it was.	Yali tamanyi ssaawa mmeka.
I just want to talk to him again	Njagala kuddamu kwogera naye kyokka
I love going to work.	Njagala nnyo okugenda ku mulimu.
I have a job to do here	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola wano
He might have had an agenda.	Yandiba nga yalina agenda.
That was the best.	Ekyo yali asinga.
There’s always a reason.	Bulijjo waliwo ensonga.
My friend from school	Mukwano gwange okuva ku ssomero
This seems awful.	Kino kirabika kibi nnyo.
In fact, that might work.	Mu butuufu, ekyo kiyinza okukola.
Obviously, that was the problem.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
He was a young child.	Yali mwana muto.
It’s not for everyone but that’s the point.	Si ya buli muntu naye eyo y’ensonga.
I was supposed to be that one.	Nze nnali wa kubeera oyo.
But this is the point.	Naye eno y’ensonga.
I’m right behind him	Nze ndi emabega we ddala
I know that he knows	Nkimanyi nti amanyi
Only one of the two will work.	Omu yekka ku bombi y’ajja okukola.
I’m not going too young	Nze sigenda muto nnyo
This was good for us.	Kino kyali kirungi gye tuli.
He is very ordinary.	Ye wa bulijjo nnyo.
We were supposed to, but no one actually did.	Twali tulina okukikola, naye mu butuufu tewali yakikola.
But he is good to have in trouble.	Naye mulungi okubeera naye mu buzibu.
You have to work, too.	Naawe olina okukola.
And the issue was this weekend.	Era ensonga yali wiikendi eno.
It’s hard for me.	Kizibu gyendi.
I'll go all right.	Nja kugenda bulungi.
Obviously this is not the case.	Kya lwatu kino si bwe kiri.
I wonder what is going on	Nze nneebuuza ekigenda mu maaso
This is why it is not.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki si bwe kiri.
I didn’t like it at all	Nnali sikyagala n’akatono
He is a man of practice.	Musajja wa nkola.
That’s what he has to answer.	Ekyo ky’alina okuddamu.
I had no idea about him, of course	Nali sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku ye, ddala
This is the place.	Kino kye kifo.
I wasn’t sure how many	Nali sikakasa nti mmeka
I know what it is	Nze mmanyi kye kiri
At the same time.	Mu kiseera kye kimu.
That will definitely happen.	Ekyo kijja kubaawo ddala.
I knew exactly who he was	Nnali mmanyi bulungi ani
One cannot help what they are.	Omuntu tasobola kuyamba kye bali.
I don’t really know anything about this.	Kino sirina kye mmanyi ddala.
Immediately.	Amangu.
You were here.	Ggwe wali wano.
I want them in place.	Njagala bali mu kifo.
I can't believe he's really mine	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ddala wa kubeera wange
I wanted to be human.	Nnali njagala kubeera muntu.
I just want to go home now	Njagala kudda waka kyokka kati
This was home, and he was here.	Kino kyali waka, era yali wano.
I really like where this is going	Njagala nnyo kino gye kigenda
I didn’t want to stay too long	Nnali saagala kumala bbanga ddene nnyo
I need to know these things	Ebintu bino nneetaaga okumanya
I guess he's been around for a long time	Ntebereza nti amaze ebbanga ddene
Not in a place like this.	Si mu kifo nga kino.
I wanted to be with him all the time	Nnali njagala okubeera naye buli kiseera
Not that that’s a bad thing.	Si nti ekyo kintu kibi.
It’s up to me.	Kiri gyendi.
You can do it.	Osobola okukikola.
He needed to talk.	Yali yeetaaga okwogera.
But he had a phone.	Naye yali alina essimu.
Not even about this.	Si wadde ku nsonga eno.
I was pretty unaware	Nali bulungi nga simanyi
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
You going backwards.	Ggwe okudda emabega.
Not one of us, both of us.	Si omu ku ffe, ffembi.
I’m not sure if he can	Sikakasa oba asobola
It’s difficult.	Kizibu.
I wasn’t sure myself	Nze kennyini nnali sikakasa
I didn’t really know what he was talking about	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kye yali ayogera
I can’t quite speak.	Sisobola bulungi kwogera.
I have a request.	Nze nnina kye nsaba.
He was actually a very nice person.	Mu butuufu yali muntu mulungi nnyo.
You want to know everything.	Oyagala okumanya buli kimu.
I feel authentic.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mazima.
I wasn’t in the right place	Nnali siri mu kifo kituufu
I didn’t know where it was	Nali simanyi gye kyali
That might be what’s going on here.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kye kigenda mu maaso wano.
I love being with you too	Nange njagala nnyo okubeera naawe
And yet it was there.	Era naye nga kiri awo.
I won’t talk to you	Sijja kwogera naawe
This is why he went.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki yagenda.
But he wants to be.	Naye ayagala kubeera.
It doesn't come.	Tekijja.
I’ve always been busy, very busy.	Bulijjo mbadde bbize, bbize nnyo.
As if no one really knows.	Nga bwe kiri nti ddala tewali amanyi.
There is no such thing now.	Tewali kintu ng’ekyo kati.
But here is hope.	Naye wano waliwo essuubi.
He can something about anything.	Asobola ekintu ku kintu kyonna.
He had something he wanted.	Yalina ky’ayagala.
I couldn’t speak.	Nnali sisobola kwogera.
I should have known that wasn’t the case	Nnali nsaanidde okumanya nti ekyo si bwe kyali
I will never allow something like that to happen again	Sijja kukkiriza kintu ng’ekyo kuddamu kubaawo
That’s really good.	Ekyo kirungi ddala.
Now it was his turn.	Kati kyali kiseera kye.
You know that we have.	Omanyi nti tulina.
For about an hour.	Okumala essaawa nga emu.
She has no husband.	Talina musajja.
Nothing serious yet.	Tewali kintu kya maanyi n’okutuusa kati.
I am a very busy man	Ndi musajja bbize nnyo
The only thing.	Ekintu kyokka.
Maybe it will be the morning.	Mpozzi kijja kuba kya makya.
She said no, she was fine.	Yagamba nti nedda, yali bulungi.
How it would be.	Engeri gye kyandibadde.
Very soon, in fact.	Mu bbanga ttono ddala, mu butuufu.
I have no idea what he was doing there	Sirina kye mmanyi kye yali akola eyo
We need help.	Twetaaga obuyambi.
We'll be back soon!.	Tujja kuddamu mu bbanga ttono!.
I think you have as good a chance as anyone	Ndowooza olina omukisa omulungi nga omuntu yenna
You are here now, and there is plenty of time.	Oli wano kati, era obudde bungi.
I am beautiful in every single way	Ndi mulungi mu buli ngeri emu
And so he did.	Era bw’atyo bwe yakola.
I couldn’t speak.	Nnali sisobola kwogera.
I want more than anything to be him	Njagala okusinga ekintu kyonna okubeera ye
He could have said that.	Ekyo yandibadde asobola okwogera.
It’s the same as with you.	Kye kimu nga bwe kiri ku ggwe.
I wonder if he is okay	Nze nneebuuza oba ali bulungi
I think he would like that too	Ndowooza naye ekyo yandiyagadde
I have it.	Nze nnina.
There is nothing about him.	Tewali kintu kyonna ku ye.
I don't know how to say this	Kino simanyi ngeri ya kwogera
It’s a really good movie.	Ddala firimu nnungi nnyo.
They are there now.	Bali awo kati.
I am not alone in this	Kino siri nzekka
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo nnyo
I didn’t know how much he was going to agree	Nnali simanyi bwe yali agenda kukkiriza
This is a daunting task.	Guno mulimu gwa maanyi.
I think that’s pretty cool	Ndowooza ekyo kirungi nnyo
I was so in love with it	Nnali njagala nnyo
I think it always will	Ndowooza bulijjo kijja kubaawo
I need to be with a friend.	Nneetaaga okubeera ne mukwano gwange.
What you knew.	Kye wali okimanyi.
You want, you want, you want!.	Oyagala, oyagala, oyagala!.
I'll see.	Nja kulaba.
It’s as simple as that.	Kyangu nnyo nga ekyo.
It’s hard to say exactly how.	Kizibu okwogera ddala engeri gye kiri.
He is very lonely.	Ali yekka nnyo.
This was a very powerful moment.	Kino kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
I couldn’t be happier	Nnali siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo
But it’s coming.	Naye kijja.
I can’t do anything about that	Ekyo sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
I can’t be a good kid.	Sisobola kuba mwana mulungi.
He had a feeling something was going to happen.	Yalina endowooza nti waliwo ekigenda okubaawo.
I guess you have that point	Ntebereza nti olina ensonga eyo
Where are you?.	Ggwe gy’oli?.
I really didn’t want to talk to him now	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kwogera naye kati
I needed to think about everything	Nnali nneetaaga okulowooza ku buli kimu
I can’t believe any of this is happening	Siyinza kukkiriza nti waliwo ekintu kyonna ku bino ekigenda mu maaso
I will do my job.	Nja kukola omulimu gwange.
I feel better though	Mpulira bulungi wadde
There are so many reasons.	Waliwo ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
He won't 'come.	Tajja 'kujja.
Maybe it would be a good thing.	Mpozzi kyandibadde kintu kirungi.
What he’s going to do.	Kye agenda okukola.
I didn’t want to though.	Nnali saagala wadde.
That would be much easier.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
We can do it.	Tusobola okukikola.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Mpozzi katono, mpozzi bingi.
I didn’t know how to preach	Nali simanyi ngeri ki gye nnali nnyinza kubuulira
I have no real problem with this.	Kino sirina buzibu bwa ddala.
I could hear behind me.	Nnali mpulira emabega wange.
I was doing the same thing	Nze nali nkola ekintu kye kimu
He was like me.	Yali nga nze.
Person.	Omuntu.
You can’t come here.	Tosobola kujja wano.
I didn’t even know where he lived	Nali simanyi na gye yali abeera
He said that he was not.	Yagamba nti si bwe yali.
I know how to deal with those	Nze mmanyi okukola ku ebyo
And the car was great.	Era mmotoka yali nnungi nnyo.
He knew this would be coming.	Yali akimanyi nti kino kijja kuba kijja.
She looked that good	Yali alabika bulungi bw’atyo
You probably know that too.	Ekyo oboolyawo naawe okimanyi.
He comes to me.	Ajja gyendi.
You will be able to speak very well.	Ojja kusobola okwogera obulungi ennyo.
I didn’t want anything	Nnali sirina kye nnali njagala
But you don’t know how to move on.	Naye tomanyi kugenda mu maaso.
I think it’s going to be great.	Ndowooza kigenda kuba kirungi nnyo.
I know we can do it.	Nkimanyi nti tusobola okukikola.
I was doing pretty well actually	Nali nkola bulungi nnyo mu butuufu
We have a lot of money.	Tulina ssente nnyingi.
I didn’t know where.	Nali simanyi wa.
I couldn’t believe what was happening	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza kyali kigenda mu maaso
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
I can do nothing myself	Nze kennyini sirina kye nsobola kukola
But this isn’t the whole point.	Naye eno si y’ensonga yonna.
He could neither speak nor think.	Yali tasobola kwogera wadde okulowooza.
I want to know who it is.	Njagala kumanya ani.
I have no problem with that	Ekyo sirina buzibu bwonna
You know what it is.	Omanyi kiki.
I was hoping he would	Nali nsuubira nti ajja kukikola
He didn't know how to deal with this.	Kino yali tamanyi ngeri ya kukola ku nsonga eno.
But it would be dangerous.	Naye kyandibadde kya bulabe.
I am very hungry too	Nange enjala enjala nnyo
He said that he was not.	Yagamba nti si bwe yali.
But no, not much.	Naye nedda, si bingi.
He tried to back away.	Yagezaako okudda emabega.
No city was in sight.	Tewali kibuga kyali kirabika.
I certainly hoped he would	Mazima ddala nnali nsuubira nti ajja kukikola
I won’t be good and that’s okay	Sijja kuba mulungi era ekyo si kibi
Indeed, I am very sorry	Mazima ddala, nsonyiwa nnyo
You are one of us.	Ggwe oli omu ku ffe.
This was not the case	Kino si bwe kyali
He told me he didn’t know.	Yang’amba nti tamanyi.
I think he probably knew	Ndowooza osanga yali akimanyi
There is no problem with this.	Tewali buzibu ku nsonga eno.
I could, you know	Nnali nsobola, omanyi
But this is not quite true.	Naye kino si kituufu nnyo.
I will do this again	Kino nja kuddamu okukola
I couldn’t do that and be myself	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola era nga nze kennyini
There is no easy answer.	Tewali kyangu kya kuddamu.
There are police everywhere still.	Waliwo poliisi buli wamu n’okutuusa kati.
He needed to be someone else.	Yali yeetaaga okuba omuntu omulala.
He doesn’t know who.	Tamanyi ani.
I probably won’t even be there	Oboolyawo sijja na kubeerawo
And he knows.	Era amanyi.
Or to anyone for that matter.	Oba eri omuntu yenna ku nsonga eyo.
I thought he came too soon.	Nalowooza nti yajja mangu nnyo.
He loved talking to her.	Yali ayagala nnyo okwogera naye.
I am very well off	Nze ndi bulungi nnyo
You can easily do this at home.	Kino osobola bulungi okukikola awaka.
I think they’re on to me.	Ndowooza bali ku nze.
He's been around for a while now.	Amaze ebbanga kati.
I know this to be true	Kino nkimanyi nti kituufu
And it’s easy to live.	Era kyangu okubeera.
This is fine as well.	Kino kirungi nga bwe kiri.
I had no choice in the matter	Nnali sirina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo
He doesn’t have anything.	Talina ky’alina.
I didn’t know he was coming, either	Nange nnali simanyi nti ajja, era
I think this may be the problem.	Ndowooza kino kiyinza okuba nga kye kizibu.
' '.	' '.
I really couldn’t tell	Mazima ddala nnali sisobola kumanya
I need someone.	Nze nneetaaga omuntu.
The house was really nice.	Ennyumba yali nnungi ddala.
And just everything.	Era buli kimu kyokka.
I’m glad you’re my friend too	Ndi musanyufu nti naawe oli mukwano gwange
I am so happy to have you here today.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera naawe wano leero.
I can’t do it alone	Sisobola kukikola nzekka
He might have fallen asleep himself.	Yandiba nga ye kennyini yeebase.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
But there was so much, so much more.	Naye nga waliwo bingi nnyo, bingi nnyo.
And he did, apparently.	Era yakikola, kirabika.
He says he will do it.	Agamba nti ajja kukikola.
I know something is going on	Nze mmanyi waliwo ekigenda mu maaso
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
I said the same picture	Nagamba nti ekifaananyi kye kimu
I wanted to know about it	Nnali njagala okumanya ku nsonga eyo
He is not a doctor.	Si musawo.
I didn’t know about that.	Ensonga eyo nnali simanyi.
I was thinking the same thing	Nange nnali ndowooza ekintu kye kimu
I think he's happy.	Ndowooza musanyufu.
I just need one thing from a good guy	Nze nneetaaga ekintu kimu kyokka okuva eri ggaayi omulungi
I still didn’t even have a car.	N’okutuusa kati nnali sirina wadde mmotoka.
I just want that one	Nze njagala oyo yekka
Not one guy.	Si ggaayi omu.
Below.	Wansi wa.
I know exactly who he is	Nze mmanyi ddala ky’ali
And it’s a beautiful thing.	Era kintu kirungi nnyo.
He doesn’t even know where they are.	Tamanyi na gye bali.
I have a job to do	Nnina omulimu gwe nkola
Now it seems to be here.	Kati kirabika kiri wano.
Why he did it doesn’t matter.	Lwaki yakikola si kikulu.
I knew you would	Nnali nkimanyi nti ojja kukikola
It certainly felt good.	Mazima ddala yawulira bulungi.
I know what we can do	Nze mmanyi kye tusobola okukola
Not good down here.	Si kirungi wansi wano.
I didn’t know what to do with it	Nnali simanyi kya kukikola
It’s not easy at work.	Si kyangu ku mulimu.
And he may have had.	Era ayinza okuba nga yalina.
I loved the idea.	Nnali njagala nnyo endowooza eyo.
He didn’t know what day it was.	Yali tamanyi lunaku ki.
And even now.	Era ne kati.
There is no progression.	Tewali kugenda mu maaso.
You never know how it’s going to happen.	Tomanyi ngeri gye kigenda kubaawo.
But that wasn’t the point.	Naye eyo si ye yali ensonga.
I think he is talking to me	Ndowooza ayogera nange
I was just incredulous	Nali nzekka nga siyinza kukkiriza
He could hardly see.	Yali tasobola bulungi kulaba.
I guess you’ll have to work tonight.	Ntebereza nti ojja kuba olina okukola ekiro kino.
Actually, that’s not always true.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si kituufu bulijjo.
However, you cannot do it.	Kyokka tosobola kukikola.
I don't want to.	Saagala.
We can do that.	Ekyo tusobola okukikola.
He could easily see why his brother was so eager.	Yali asobola bulungi okulaba ensonga lwaki muganda we yali ayagala nnyo.
I wasn’t ready to do that, certainly not with him	Ekyo nali siri mwetegefu kukikola, mazima ddala si naye
But it is what it is	Naye kye kiri
He did what he had to do.	Yakola kye yali alina okukola.
I was so desperate	Nnali nfunye essuubi ddene nnyo
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
I do whatever and I work hard when there is work.	Nkola kyonna era nkola nnyo nga waliwo omulimu.
We are so much more now.	Tuli bingi nnyo kati.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange asinga.
I wondered if she was doing the same thing	Nneebuuza oba naye yali akola ekintu kye kimu
I wanted to know what it was like	Nnali njagala okumanya bwe kyali
I can do nothing but watch	Sirina kye nsobola kukola okuggyako okulaba
He looked very happy.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo.
Soon, he would have to leave the organization.	Mu bbanga ttono, yandibadde alina okuva mu kibiina.
I want you, you are mine	Njagala ggwe, oli wange
I love how beautiful everything looks	Njagala nnyo engeri buli kimu gye kirabika obulungi
That's just me.	Oyo nze nzekka.
I can think clearly now.	Nsobola okulowooza obulungi kati.
I hoped that was all	Nnali nsuubira nti ekyo kyokka kye kyali
I always wondered what that was	Bulijjo nnali nneebuuza ekyo kye kyali
That was absolutely true.	Ekyo kyali kituufu ddala.
He obviously knew it.	Kya lwatu nti yali akimanyi.
And I’m not the only one.	Nange si nze nzekka.
Despite her good looks.	Wadde nga yali alabika bulungi.
However, this is not the case here.	Kyokka kino si bwe kiri wano.
I will do everything.	Nja kukola buli kimu.
I wanted things my way	Ebintu nnali njagala mu ngeri yange
For this he is here.	Ku kino ali wano.
I couldn’t believe it	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza
He was very happy about that.	Ekyo yali musanyufu nnyo.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
But not for very long.	Naye si lwa bbanga ddene nnyo.
Where is he?.	Ali ludda wa?.
I wasn’t just that person.	Nze nali si muntu oyo yekka.
It seems to be the same.	Kirabika kye kimu.
It will be difficult.	Kijja kuba kizibu.
I knew that at this point	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi mu kiseera kino
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
Nobody would do that here.	Ekyo tewali yandikoze wano.
But that was fine.	Naye ekyo kyali kirungi.
He is very beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo.
But that wasn’t the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kyali.
I think it’s very important and very important.	Ndowooza nti kikulu nnyo era kikulu nnyo.
There seemed to be no one in the house.	Mu nnyumba yalabika nga tewali muntu yenna.
You will love it.	Ojja kwagala.
It's a difficult place for you.	Kifo kizibu gy'oli.
It won’t come.	Tekijja kujja.
But who else .	Naye ani omulala .
He knew what was going on.	Yali amanyi ekigenda mu maaso.
He said, that was as close as he could get.	Yagamba, ekyo kyali kumpi nga bwe yali asobola okufuna.
He wants to talk to you about it.	Ayagala kwogera naawe ku nsonga eyo.
I could have said no	Nnali nsobola okugamba nti nedda
I wonder a lot.	Nze nneebuuza nnyo.
But we have what we have.	Naye tulina bye tulina.
He couldn’t be here.	Yali tasobola kubeera wano.
I think we should talk about.	Ndowooza tusaanidde okwogera ku...
But it’s not me.	Naye si nze.
He was really strong.	Ddala yali wa maanyi.
And this was true.	Era kino kyali kituufu.
But he speaks well.	Naye ayogera bulungi.
I was.	Nali.
But he didn’t know.	Naye yali tamanyi.
I just know that you don’t	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti tolina
This is a good place.	Kino kifo kirungi.
He hoped the speech would be short.	Yalina essuubi nti okwogera kujja kuba kumpi.
I guess it doesn’t matter now	Ntebereza nti kati si kikulu
I have to work this evening	Nnina okukola akawungeezi ka leero
I think he’ll be fine	Ndowooza ajja kuba bulungi
But he knew it himself.	Naye ye kennyini yali akimanyi.
That’s good, very good.	Ekyo kirungi, kirungi nnyo.
He cannot be a happy man.	Tayinza kuba nga musajja musanyufu.
That would be something.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu.
I certainly think you will	Mazima ddala ndowooza nti ojja kukikola
No chance of waiting.	Tewali mukisa gwa kulinda.
I had nothing on me.	Nnali sirina kintu kyonna ku nze.
The only thing.	Ekintu kyokka.
I was so excited.	Nnali musanyufu nnyo.
I was planning to go.	Nnali nteekateeka kugenda.
He knew he wouldn't.	Yali akimanyi nti tajja kukikola.
He was a man.	Yali musajja.
I really didn’t know what to say at the time, either.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kwogera mu kiseera ekyo, era.
You’re sure you knew who he was.	Okakasa nti wali omanyi ani.
I knew one would come	Nali mmanyi nti omu ajja kujja
But we’ll see.	Naye tujja kulaba.
I'm sure I wanted to.	Nkakasa nti nnali njagala.
I’m actually going to spend time with him	Mu butuufu ngenda kumala naye obudde
He certainly did.	Mazima ddala yakikola.
I am well aware of that.	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi.
I cannot say this at this time	Kino sisobola kwogera mu kiseera kino
He was a human being.	Yali muntu.
Think.	Okulowooza.
I knew what was going on here	Nali mmanyi ekigenda mu maaso wano
But not in my case.	Naye si mu mbeera yange.
I can’t do this now	Kino sisobola kukikola kati
And no, you may not.	Era nedda, oyinza obutakola.
I’m pretty good here	Nze wano ndi bulungi nnyo
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
I didn’t think he had it in him	Nnali sirowooza nti yalina mu ye
And he did it.	Era yakikola.
She was so beautiful in so many ways	Yali mulungi nnyo mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo
I can only imagine what this looks like	Nsobola okulowooza ku ngeri kino gye kirabika
I’ve always known exactly where he was	Bulijjo mbadde mmanyi bulungi gye yali
I know what they are	Nze mmanyi kye bali
I’m not really a very nice person.	Mu butuufu siri muntu mulungi nnyo.
I need to talk to him	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye
I’ve wanted it for a very long time	Nze mbadde njagala okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo
I feel convinced that.	Mpulira nga nkakasa nti.
That should have helped.	Ekyo kyalina okuyamba.
Not even us.	Si wadde ffe.
I can do this, he thought	Kino nsobola okukikola, bwe yalowooza
I had lost hope	Nnali nfunye essuubi
The answer would be enough	Okuddamu kyandibadde kumala
This was going to be bad.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kibi.
It was very powerful.	Yali ya maanyi nnyo.
But it’s also not a thing.	Naye era si kintu.
Earlier you were dangerous.	Emabegako wali wa bulabe.
I have been working very, very hard.	Mbadde nkola nnyo nnyo.
You have it now.	Olina kati.
No one has a problem with that.	Ekyo tewali alina buzibu.
I’m not that me.	Nze si nze ekyo.
I think he definitely has that point	Ndowooza ddala alina ensonga eyo
That can certainly do it.	Ekyo mazima ddala kiyinza okukikola.
He says he's not here.	Agamba nti tali wano.
But there is no time.	Naye tewali budde.
It’s easy to see.	Kyangu okulaba.
I don’t know if it really is.	Simanyi oba ddala bwe kiri.
Though that's not the point.	Wadde nga eyo si y'ensonga.
I didn’t want to either	Nange nnali saagala
I want any or all opinions	Njagala endowooza yonna oba yonna
He had plenty of time.	Yalina obudde bungi.
Here he was, he knew it.	Wano we yali, yali akimanyi.
Always am, always have, always want	Bulijjo ndi, bulijjo nnina, bulijjo njagala
Every day of the week.	Buli lunaku mu wiiki.
The same night.	Ekiro kye kimu.
I didn’t even have to say anything	Nnali sirina na kwogera kintu kyonna
He must be asleep.	Ateekwa okuba nga yeebase.
There's only one thing you want more than yourself.	Waliwo ekintu kimu kyokka ky'oyagala okusinga ggwe kennyini.
I was sure there was that thing	Nali nkakasa nti waliwo ekintu ekyo
There are so many.	Bingi nnyo.
I always wanted to be like my dad.	Bulijjo nnali njagala okubeera nga taata wange.
It’s very hard to say right now.	Kizibu nnyo okwogera mu kiseera kino.
From morning till night.	Okuva ku makya okutuuka ekiro.
I want to talk to you about it	Njagala kwogera naawe ku nsonga eyo
I guess he didn’t have to go	Ntebereza nti yali talina kugenda
He had been for a very long time.	Yali amaze ebbanga ddene nnyo.
I want to do it again	Njagala kuddamu kukikola
You know what it is.	Omanyi kye kiri.
That was the moment.	Ekyo kye kyali akaseera.
I had no idea of ​​that.	Ekyo nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
I can’t wait for next week.	Siyinza kulinda wiiki ejja.
Tomorrow is the day.	Enkya lwe lunaku.
It's just too bad.	Kibi nnyo kyokka.
I'm not sure about any of the positions myself.	Sikakasa ku kifo kyonna nze kennyini.
Now he had a chance to think.	Kati yafuna omukisa okulowooza.
I really didn’t know why	Mazima ddala nnali simanyi lwaki
You can’t tell what he thought about it.	Tosobola kumanya kye yalowooza ku nsonga eyo.
That’s normal.	Ekyo kya bulijjo.
I needed to get out of this place	Nnali nneetaaga okuva mu kifo kino
Nothing about it.	Tewali kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
I really didn’t want to talk to him now.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kwogera naye kati.
They were almost there.	Baali kumpi okutuuka awo.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
We still don’t have it.	N’okutuusa kati tetulina.
I have nothing to do with him	Nze sirina kye nkola naye
In that regard.	Mu nsonga eyo.
We’ll be fine at home.	Tujja kuba bulungi awaka.
Very little .	Katono ddala .
He might have been asleep.	Yandiba nga yali yeebase.
You would like to.	Wandyagadde.
He is much closer than that.	Ali kumpi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He's that guy now.	Ye ggaayi oyo kati.
Or on the bus.	Oba mu bbaasi.
He's a nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi.
That was it.	Ekyo kyali.
At that time you couldn’t buy one.	Mu kiseera ekyo tosobola kugula emu.
Something like this.	Kintu nga kino.
Now you will know everyone there.	Kati ojja kumanya buli muntu ali eyo.
We’re all going.	Ffenna tugenda.
I think he is this coming weekend.	Ndowooza ye wiikendi eno ejja.
I love how it looks	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kirabika
I won’t be able to do that from here	Ekyo sijja kusobola kukikola okuva wano
I think he already knew	Ndowooza yali amanyi dda
He has been sick.	Abadde mulwadde.
I know it as well as anyone.	Nze nkimanyi bulungi nga omuntu yenna.
But now he was here.	Naye kati yali wano.
It’s not a problem at all.	Si kizibu n’akatono.
Father.	Taata.
As he knew it.	Nga bwe yali akimanyi.
I wasn’t myself at all	Nze kennyini nali siri n’akatono
That's a bad thing.	Ekyo kibi.
I love my phone as much as anyone else.	Njagala nnyo essimu yange nga omuntu omulala yenna.
My dog ​​was my best friend.	Embwa yange yali mukwano gwange ennyo.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo kye kyali.
It was home.	Yali waka.
Surely he knew this.	Mazima kino yali akimanyi.
And so far, so good.	Era okutuuka wano, kirungi nnyo.
Nothing, really.	Tewali kintu kyonna, ddala.
I’m pretty sure you do too.	Nkakasa bulungi nti naawe okola.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I had no idea what I was doing or saying	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi kye nkola oba okwogera
That was a lot of money.	Ekyo kyali ssente nnyingi nnyo.
And we have it.	Era tulina.
That’s just who we are.	Ekyo kye tuli kyokka.
I think it might be something	Ndowooza kiyinza okuba ekintu
I just need to talk to him	Nze nneetaaga kwogera naye kyokka
He had it.	Yalina.
I was getting too far ahead	Nali ngenda ngenda mu maaso nnyo
But for another job.	Naye ku mulimu omulala.
I really didn’t know what to do	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kukola
I knew exactly what to expect	Nnali mmanyi bulungi kye nnali nsuubira
It was almost one.	Kumpi yali emu.
They were actually there.	Mu butuufu baali awo.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
I can do this though	Kino nsobola okukikola wadde
I think the problem is getting worse.	Ndowooza ekizibu kigenda kigenda mu maaso.
I won’t be here at the office tomorrow.	Sijja kubeera wano ku ofiisi enkya.
I think we have a problem	Ndowooza tulina ekizibu
I’ve been wanting to make one for a while.	Nze mbadde njagala okukola emu okumala akaseera.
I am very lucky.	Ndi wa mukisa nnyo.
I have to think clearly	Nnina okulowooza obulungi
He is her child as well as mine.	Ye mwana we nga bwe kiri ne wange.
But that’s not the point.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga.
He should have known better.	Yandibadde amanyi bulungi.
I wasn’t very strong	Nnali sirina maanyi nnyo
I’m lucky today.	Nze leero nfunye omukisa.
This is what you want.	Kino ky’oyagala.
He would have liked what he saw there.	Yandiyagadde bye yalaba eyo.
Although he doesn’t have to.	Wadde nga talina kukikola.
But everything is not so easy.	Naye buli kimu si kyangu nnyo.
I knew it was though	Nali nkimanyi nti bwe kiri wadde
Not much more than that.	Si bingi okusinga ekyo.
I want to do this job.	Njagala kukola mulimu guno.
Good, but typical.	Kirungi, naye nga kya bulijjo.
I thought coming home for dinner would be nice	Nalowooza nti okudda awaka okulya ekyeggulo kyandibadde kirungi
I wish it was, but it’s not	Njagala bwe kyali, naye si bwe kiri
I knew he wouldn’t last long	Namanya nti tajja kumala bbanga ddene
You don’t want to know that.	Ekyo toyagala kumanya.
However, he could not stay long.	Kyokka, yali tasobola kumala bbanga ddene.
He can’t make money.	Tasobola kukola ssente.
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola.
You are in a good position.	Oli mu mbeera nnungi.
But not yet yet.	Naye si n’okutuusa kati.
I know it was bad, though	Nkimanyi nti kyali kibi, naye
Not in my house.	Si mu nnyumba yange.
I'll be back in that hour	Nja kudda mu ssaawa eyo
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
I had little appetite	Nnali sirina nnyo njagala ya kulya
I knew that perfectly well	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi bulungi ddala
Not even that.	Si wadde ekyo.
I can’t believe it’s in my house	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kiri mu nnyumba yange
That’s not a good time.	Ekyo si kiseera kirungi.
I was very young at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali muto nnyo
I was totally ready for anything at that point	Nali mwetegefu ddala okukola ekintu kyonna mu kiseera ekyo
I certainly thought we could do it.	Mazima ddala nnalowooza nti tusobola okukikola.
You might think hard about this.	Oyinza okulowooza ennyo ku kino.
In which direction, he didn't know.	Mu ludda ki, yali tamanyi.
I know that’s the case	Nkimanyi ekyo bwe kiri
It’s a bad time.	Kiseera kibi.
We can go now.	Tusobola okugenda kati.
I need to do it better	Nze nneetaaga okukikola obulungi
There is nothing to say.	Tewali kya kwogera.
I’ll get back to you soon	Nja kudda gy’oli mu bbanga ttono
It is your policy.	Ye nkola yo.
You don’t know.	Tomanyi.
He is very much his own person.	Ye muntu we nnyo.
He was a human being. 	Yali muntu. 
I just needed to get to you	Nnali nneetaaga okutuuka gy’oli kyokka
I guess we are.	Ntebereza nti tuli.
There is no money.	Tewali ssente.
But, not everything is.	Naye, si buli kimu nti bwe kiri.
I hope you are anyway	Nsuubira nti oli mu ngeri yonna
It was much easier going than he expected.	Kyali kyangu nnyo okugenda okusinga bwe yali asuubira.
That’s not entirely true.	Ekyo si kituufu ddala.
I didn’t know which direction I was going	Nnali simanyi ludda lwe nnali ngenda
I was thinking of his brother	Nnali ndowooza ku muganda we
I couldn’t say the same about myself	Nze nali sisobola kwogera kye kimu ku nze
But this is it.	Naye kino.
I have to be something	Nnina okuba ekintu
I need to think about time	Nze nneetaaga okulowooza ku budde
You hear me.	Ggwe mpulira.
I think he was just trying to do the right thing.	Ndowooza yali agezaako kukola kituufu kyokka.
He could see.	Yali asobola okulaba.
I guess that’s what’s happening	Ntebereza nti ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso
I have done something before though	Nnina kye nkola emabegako wadde
But no one is talking about this.	Naye kino tewali ayogera.
I know he will do it	Nkimanyi nti ajja kukikola
I thought he had you	Nalowooza nti alina ggwe
Someone else did the hitting.	Omuntu omulala ye yakola okukuba.
I will never let anyone do that again	Ekyo sijja kuddamu kukkiriza muntu yenna kukikola
However, I was kind of interested	Kyokka nnali mu ngeri ya njagala
He can’t talk to her.	Tasobola kwogera naye.
I couldn’t let that happen	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukkiriza kubaawo
There is only me.	Waliwo nze nzekka.
We will always do it.	Bulijjo tujja kukikola.
No, it wasn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kyali.
This may or may not be what you want.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga ky’oyagala oba nedda.
But, the reason.	Naye, ensonga.
I didn’t want to do that	Ekyo nnali saagala kukikola
He had no idea what to say.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku ky’alina okwogera.
I can easily do it	Nsobola bulungi okukikola
It was just this.	Kyali kino kyokka.
Himself or me.	Ye kennyini oba nze.
He knew it.	Yali akimanyi.
He was my father.	Yali taata wange.
I think this will work	Ndowooza kino kijja kukola
There is no one single thing.	Tewali kintu kimu kimu.
I like to make things	Njagala nnyo okukola ebintu
I think that would be good	Ndowooza ekyo kyandibadde kirungi
However, it was a challenge.	Kyokka, kyali kizibu.
That doesn’t seem to be the case here.	Ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri wano.
I guess in your case he doesn't have to try	Ntebereza mu mbeera yo talina kugezaako
I hope you know the same thing	Nsuubira nti naawe omanyi ekintu kye kimu
I will never do this again	Kino sijja kuddamu kukikola
I thought it was an issue.	Nalowooza nti yali nsonga.
Maybe he had.	Mpozzi nga yalina.
I won’t be with him	Sijja kubeera naye
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
Not on me right now.	Si ku nze mu kiseera kino.
He had to leave school.	Yalina okuva mu ssomero.
But it’s definitely not working.	Naye nga ddala si kukola.
I know a lot from you	Nze mmanyi bingi okuva gy’oli
The plan worked.	Enteekateeka eno yakola.
That would be us.	Ekyo kyandibadde ffe.
I didn’t know you were here	Nnali simanyi nti oli wano
I don’t want to go home without it	Saagala kudda waka nga sirina
Now it will be easier.	Kati kijja kuba kyangu.
But that won’t be enough.	Naye ekyo tekijja kumala.
I don’t want to say that yet.	Ekyo saagala kwogera n’okutuusa kati.
We are all over the place.	Tuli mu kifo kyonna.
He came himself.	Yajja ye kennyini.
I don’t want to go back to the party	Saagala kudda ku mbaga
It was love.	Kyali kwagala.
I knew I felt great	Nali mmanyi nti mpulira bulungi nnyo
This will be no worse than today.	Kino tekijja kuba kibi okusinga leero.
He lives here.	Abeera wano.
I was going to the city	Nnali ngenda mu kibuga
It’s not easy, actually, for any of us.	Si kyangu, mu butuufu, eri buli omu ku ffe.
I love it anyway.	Njagala nnyo mu ngeri yonna.
I expected so much from you	Nali nsuubira bingi nnyo okuva gy’oli
I was wondering if this is so	Nali nneebuuza oba kino bwe kiri
He is at school.	Ali ku ssomero.
You have to work.	Olina okukola.
I was terrified now	Nali ntya nnyo kati
I know how to make plans	Nze mmanyi okukola enteekateeka
It can be difficult to do so.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu okukikola.
I was ready to go anyway	Nali mwetegefu okugenda mu ngeri yonna
He makes a lot of money.	Akola ssente nnyingi.
I couldn’t do it, of course	Nnali sisobola kukikola, ddala
And it’s dangerous.	Era kya bulabe.
This is very powerful.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo.
He looks pretty normal.	Alabika bulungi nga wa bulijjo.
To his dog.	Eri embwa ye.
But he didn’t have it.	Naye yali talina.
He was a man who could well .	Yali musajja ayinza bulungi .
Here as I am.	Wano nga nze.
You know how he could be.	Omanyi engeri gye yali asobola okuba.
I have to work.	Nnina okukola.
We’re at the movies.	Tuli ku firimu.
I needed him, too	Nnali nneetaaga naye
He knew it wouldn’t be easy.	Yali akimanyi nti tekijja kuba kyangu.
No, he isn’t.	Nedda, si bw’atyo.
I love reading, of course	Njagala nnyo okusoma, ddala
And that you would.	Era nti wandibadde.
But in that case he knows who.	Naye mu mbeera eyo amanyi ani.
Now, not so much.	Kati, si bingi nnyo.
I didn’t know what it was	Nnali simanyi kye kyali
I feel like we’re almost one	Mpulira nga kumpi tuli kimu
And we don’t have an easy answer.	Era tetulina kyangu kya kuddamu.
That was fine in a way.	Ekyo kyali kirungi mu ngeri emu.
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
I couldn’t believe it was him	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti ye ye
Read.	Okusoma.
It’s always going to be there	Bulijjo kigenda kubeerawo
For me it’s easy.	Nze kyangu.
I needed food urgently.	Nnali nneetaaga emmere mu bwangu.
I really didn’t know why	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi lwaki
I was very curious	Nnali njagala nnyo okumanya
I didn’t have any money	Nnali sirina ssente yonna
But he was ready.	Naye yali mwetegefu.
I will find a way to win	Nja kufuna engeri gye nnyinza okuwangula
And, in a sense, it had.	Era, mu ngeri emu, kyalina.
No, this way it is easier.	Nedda, mu ngeri eno kyangu.
I will never live in this house again	Sijja kuddamu kubeera mu nnyumba eno
He may be alone.	Ayinza okuba nga yekka.
But it’s good you’re with him today.	Naye kirungi oli naye leero.
I have no idea what to do	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kya kukola
You know what, no.	Omanyi kiki, nedda.
It was really difficult.	Ddala kyali kizibu.
I don’t care about myself	Sifaayo ku nze kennyini
Without a house.	Nga tewali nnyumba.
We have to get out of here.	Tulina okuva wano.
I think it's wrong.	Ndowooza kibi.
For me it was very important.	Nze kyali kikulu nnyo.
I’m doing better now.	Nze kati nkola bulungi.
I think everybody knows it	Ndowooza buli omu akimanyi
I thought he would	Nalowooza nti ajja kukikola
You want where you are.	Oyagala gy’oli.
Main '.	Kikulu '.
In the open.	Mu lwatu.
No time there, no space, no nothing.	Tewali budde awo, tewali bbanga, tewali kintu kyonna.
Apparently he was.	Kirabika yali...
But he had apparently been at a party.	Naye kirabika yali abadde ku mbaga.
Of course, he did.	Kya lwatu nti yakikola.
But not everyone wants to live in the city.	Naye si buli muntu nti ayagala kubeera mu kibuga.
What's the problem.	Kiki ekizibu.
That’s all something.	Ebyo byonna kintu.
I can’t talk for very long. 	Sisobola kwogera bbanga ddene nnyo. 
He was beautiful.	Yali mulungi.
We’re all fine.	Ffenna tuli bulungi.
And he didn’t want to do that.	Era ekyo yali tayagala kukikola.
Everything seems normal.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
I couldn’t say why, really.	Nnali sisobola kwogera lwaki, ddala.
I have to go now, work you know	Nnina okugenda kati, okukola omanyi
I didn’t want to talk to him	Nnali saagala kwogera naye
Everyone said no.	Buli omu yagamba nti nedda.
That was my whole point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga yange yonna.
It’s bad for everyone.	Kibi eri buli muntu.
I'm the one.	Nze nze.
More than a day.	Okusinga olunaku.
But he had no choice in the matter.	Naye yali talina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo.
It’s not necessarily as simple as that.	Si kituufu nti kyangu nga ekyo.
I couldn’t let it happen	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza kubaawo
I hope he is okay	Nsuubira nti ali bulungi
Good luck to you, good luck to me.	Omukisa gyoli, omukisa gyendi.
This is very important to us.	Kino kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
I guess you won’t know	Ntebereza nti tojja kumanya
We’re going to do it again now.	Tugenda kuddamu okukikola kati.
Really, this is in everyone’s best interest.	Ddala kino kiri mu bulungi bwa buli muntu.
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
I didn’t know he had one	Nnali simanyi nti alina emu
Herein lies the problem.	Wano we wali ekizibu.
Or so he thought it was his time.	Oba bwatyo yalowooza nti kye kiseera kye.
I am not myself myself.	Nze kennyini siri nze kennyini.
But it is not true that.	Naye si kituufu nti.
But, it’s not just that.	Naye, si ekyo kyokka.
I love this book.	Njagala nnyo ekitabo kino.
This alone will not work.	Kino kyokka tekijja kukola.
He doesn’t want you.	Tayagala ggwe.
I know what’s going on here	Nze mmanyi ekigenda mu maaso wano
He didn’t want this.	Kino yali tayagala.
I had been lucky.	Nze nali nfunye omukisa.
And I have no idea what to do	Era sirina kirowoozo ku kya kukola
She was so young and so beautiful.	Yali muto nnyo era nga mulungi nnyo.
I can’t be like you	Siyinza kubeera nga ggwe
I suppose that’s exactly what it is	Nsuubira nti ekyo kye kiri ddala
I really thought he was the one	Nze ddala nnalowooza nti ye yali omu
I can’t have this happening in my house	Siyinza kuba na kino kigenda mu maaso mu nnyumba yange
He has his friends but, well, not the same.	Alina mikwano gye naye, bulungi, si kye kimu.
I am not that person	Si nze omuntu oyo
He wants to be something.	Ayagala kubeera kintu.
I couldn’t do anything	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
He felt like now or else.	Yawulira nga kati oba si bwe kiri.
Not very good either.	Si kirungi nnyo era.
We are there with him.	Tuli awo naye.
I had no idea what to do	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi kye nnyinza kukola
You won’t have any trouble now.	Tojja kufuna buzibu bwonna kati.
In fact, everything looked good.	Mu butuufu, buli kimu kyali kirabika bulungi.
I love both of them	Njagala nnyo bombi
I have a phone call to make	Nnina essimu gye nnina okukuba
I’m not sure what to do or say	Sikakasa kya kukola oba kya kwogera
I will be totally ready	Nja kuba mwetegefu ddala
He couldn’t be himself.	Yali tasobola kubeera ye kennyini.
I wasn’t ready even an hour ago	Nnali siri mwetegefu wadde essaawa emu emabega
No one would do that.	Ekyo tewali yandikoze.
He knew exactly what he wanted	Yali amanyi bulungi kye yali ayagala
You are among friends here.	Oli mu mikwano wano.
I'll have to think about not.	Nja kuba nnina okulowooza ku si.
For that matter.	Ku nsonga eyo.
I know you’re afraid.	Nkimanyi nti otya.
It’s a friend.	Gwe mukwano.
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo
And that man is us.	Era nti omuntu ye ffe.
I hope you are well.	Nsuubira nti oli bulungi.
I will never know what it was.	Sijja kumanya kye kyali.
Apparently he does it often.	Kirabika atera okukikola.
I didn’t really know.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi.
I think what we’re going to do is this	Ndowooza kye tugenda okukola kino
I know it will happen soon	Nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono
He wanted it this way.	Yali ayagala mu ngeri eno.
It’s not unusual to be in the office.	Si kya bulijjo okubeera mu ofiisi.
He had no knowledge.	Yali talina kumanya.
I hope he wins.	Nsuubira nti ajja kuwangula.
I have to go to work.	Nnina okugenda ku mulimu.
But at the time.	Naye mu kiseera ekyo.
I think he did something to his car	Ndowooza waliwo kye yakola ku mmotoka ye
They are the way they are.	Bali bwe bali.
But it’s true.	Naye kituufu.
I know you know that	Nkimanyi nti ekyo okimanyi
He wants	Ayagala .
I should definitely get home.	Mazima ddala nsaanidde okutuuka awaka.
It’s very easy and you can do that here.	Kyangu nnyo era ekyo osobola okukikola wano.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
I wanted a home too.	Nange nnali njagala awaka.
I would love to come back here.	Njagala nnyo okudda wano.
Everyone.	Buli omu.
I could do that	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola
I would love it if you were here with me	Njagala nnyo singa oba wano nange
I really didn’t know what to do	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kukola
I didn’t want to talk about the truth.	Nnali saagala kwogera ku mazima.
And that is absolutely true.	Era ekyo kituufu nnyo.
I will continue to hope.	Nja kusigala nga nfunye essuubi.
Here is one way.	Wano waliwo engeri emu.
You’re with him.	Oli naye.
I had no expectations	Nnali sirina kye nsuubira
He told me that.	Yang’amba nti.
I absolutely love it.	Njagala nnyo ddala.
We can do that.	Ekyo tusobola okukikola.
That’s not my problem.	Ekyo si kye kizibu kyange.
I want to be myself	Njagala kubeera nze kennyini
I had no idea at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
I have a plan for you	Nnina enteekateeka gy’oli
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
I didn’t want to talk	Nnali saagala kwogera
I don’t want to say anything.	Saagala kwogera kintu kyonna.
Such an ordinary guy.	Ggaayi wa bulijjo bwatyo.
I wasn’t going to answer at all	Nnali sigenda kuddamu n’akatono
Saying things.	Okwogera ebintu.
It was a powerful one.	Kyali kya maanyi.
He seems to be himself.	Alabika ye kennyini.
I'll see you again.	Nja kuddamu okulaba.
I knew that would never happen	Nnali nkimanyi nti ekyo tekijja kubaawo
It was very intimate.	Yali ya kumpi nnyo.
No one would want that.	Ekyo tewali yandiyagadde.
He has to do everything himself.	Alina okukola buli kimu ye kennyini.
I was actually kind of good at that	Mu butuufu nnali mu ngeri ya mulungi mu ekyo
We were busy.	Twali bbize.
But that’s the problem.	Naye ekyo kye kizibu.
And yet, it’s important.	Era naye, kikulu.
I love being here.	Njagala nnyo okubeera wano.
I am very happy to work with him.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okukola naye.
He said there was no way.	Yagambye nti tewali ngeri yonna.
The same thing with.	Ekintu kye kimu ne.
This, of course, is the case.	Kino, ddala, bwe kiri.
Maybe tomorrow this house will be mine.	Mpozzi enkya ennyumba eno ejja kuba yange.
And you have it, too.	Era naawe olina.
I want to be happy.	Njagala kubeera musanyufu.
I knew better though	Nali mmanyi okusinga wadde
It was a house.	Yali nnyumba.
I just knew it was him	Nze nnali mmanyi nti ye yali
I am happy to have him here	Ndi musanyufu okubeera naye wano
And this seems to be true.	Era kino kirabika nga kituufu.
Don't come with me.	Tojja nange.
I love being with him.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye.
He knew how to do things.	Yali amanyi okukola ebintu.
However, it may be that a person is not.	Kyokka, kiyinza okubaawo nti omuntu si bw’atyo.
I can’t tell if he knows	Sisobola kumanya oba amanyi
I know where they are.	Nze mmanyi gye bali.
I know tomorrow morning	Nkimanyi enkya ku makya
I knew the reason.	Ensonga nnali mmanyi.
You have hope.	Olina essuubi.
Now I wasn’t going	Kati nnali sigenda
He was everywhere.	Yali buli wamu.
He could have said that.	Ekyo yandibadde asobola okwogera.
I hope this was true	Nsuubira kino kyali kituufu
But right now, he seems like a nice guy.	Naye mu kiseera kino, alabika nga ggaayi mulungi.
I feel so much better	Mpulira bulungi nnyo
No, it was terrible.	Nedda, kyali kibi nnyo.
No, he actually can’t.	Nedda, mu butuufu tasobola.
I want to know the food there.	Njagala okumanya emmere eri eyo.
He did a lot of reading.	Yakola nnyo okusoma.
I don’t want or need it either	Nze nange saagala oba nneetaaga
They are one in the same for me.	Bali kimu mu kimu gyendi.
I couldn’t see the expression on his face	Nnali sisobola kulaba ngeri gye yali alabika mu maaso
He was very thoughtful.	Yali alowooza nnyo.
He can’t, he can’t, he can’t.	Tasobola, tasobola, tasobola.
I want to come with you	Njagala kujja naawe
I need to regain my strength	Nnina okuddamu okufuna amaanyi
But there was no one.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna.
I thought that was you	Nalowooza nti oyo ggwe
I hope he’ll be fine	Nsuubira nti ajja kuba bulungi
But that is not the case here.	Naye wano si bwe kiri.
Please, he said.	Nsaba, bwe yagambye.
I can’t tell what it is	Sisobola kumanya kye kiri
However, it is not preaching.	Kyokka, si kubuulira.
Live.	Kubeera.
You are not real.	Toli wa ddala.
I want you home safe soon.	Njagala ggwe awaka nga oli bulungi mu bbanga ttono.
I’m not in any hurry	Siri mu bwangu bwonna
Then there was no going.	Awo nga tewali kugenda.
No one told me.	Tewali yangamba.
Really, really great.	Ddala, ddala kirungi nnyo.
I have a problem.	Nnina ekizibu.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
I feel comfortable and confident	Mpulira bulungi era nga nkakasa
I knew what he was going to do	Namanya kye yali agenda okukola
I had no issues.	Nnali sirina nsonga yonna.
I probably won’t be home until tonight	Oboolyawo sijja kudda waka okutuusa ekiro kino
Went.	Agenda.
They were there, and here we are.	Baali awo, era wano we tuli.
We are in the.	Tuli mu.
He had to act quickly.	Yalina okukola amangu.
Or the week.	Oba wiiki.
Like a book.	Nga ekitabo.
I didn't know you had a brother	Nali simanyi nti olina muganda we
I can’t wait to go home	Siyinza kulinda kudda waka
I knew all about that one too	Oyo nange nnali mmanyi byonna
That, in a sense, was what he was doing.	Ekyo, mu ngeri emu, kye yali akola.
Mostly difficulty.	Okusinga obuzibu.
Maybe he was the father.	Mpozzi ye yali taata.
Is that really what you want?.	Ddala ekyo kyoyagala?.
He has to be with her.	Alina okuba naye.
Maybe he thought he was doing the right thing.	Mpozzi yalowooza nti akola kituufu.
I had no friends there	Nnali sirina mikwano eyo
I knew this wouldn’t be easy	Namanya nti kino tekijja kuba kyangu
Or anyone, really.	Oba omuntu yenna, ddala.
I was really nervous	Ddala nnali ntya nnyo
And yet it is here.	Era naye kiri wano.
I'll probably do that tomorrow	Ekyo osanga nja kukikola enkya
I didn’t want to stay home.	Nnali saagala kusigala waka.
I don’t know how yet	Simanyi ngeri ki n’okutuusa kati
As could anyone.	Nga bwe kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
He knew so much.	Yali amanyi bingi nnyo.
Maybe it’s just me.	Mpozzi nze nzekka.
We have .	Tulina .
I just want to be normal	Njagala kubeera wa bulijjo kyokka
Everyone knew this was dangerous work.	Buli omu yali akimanyi nti guno mulimu gwa bulabe.
If only he was with me now.	Singa yali nange kati.
I think that was a good idea	Ndowooza ekyo kyali kirowoozo kirungi
I didn’t even know who it was at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi na ani
He is still here.	Akyali wano.
I know you are mine	Nkimanyi nti oli wange
But someone does their job.	Naye omuntu akola omulimu gwe.
That’s a house.	Eyo nnyumba.
I love it as much as before	Njagala nnyo nga bwe kyali emabegako
He couldn’t let that happen.	Ekyo yali tayinza kukkiriza kubaawo.
I know what we’re going to do tomorrow	Nze mmanyi kye tugenda okukola enkya
She is now a happy wife.	Kati mukyala musanyufu.
I wasn’t going to come	Nze nali sigenda kujja
I didn’t know anything in school either	Nange mu ssomero nnali sirina kye mmanyi
However, now, now.	Kyokka kati, kati.
He was done, he knew it.	Yali amaze, yali akimanyi.
Maybe he doesn’t know how.	Mpozzi nga tamanyi ngeri ki.
He was afraid of everything.	Yali atya buli kimu.
I hope from here, too	Nsuubira okuva wano, nange
He really didn't know what to do.	Mazima ddala yali tamanyi kya kukola.
No one works here.	Wano tewali akola.
He won't come.	Tajja kujja.
He was my best friend.	Yali mukwano gwange nnyo.
I really can’t wait for that!	Mazima ddala ekyo siyinza kulinda!
I can’t do this all by myself	Kino kyonna sisobola kukikola nzekka
Now it’s up to me.	Kati kiri eri nze.
He was the one.	Ye yali omu.
Glad you are doing well now.	Musanyufu nti kati okola bulungi.
Doing it away from home is difficult.	Okukikola nga toli waka kizibu.
I have a house here.	Nnina ennyumba wano.
I have, you know that	Nnina, ekyo okimanyi
I’ve been doing a lot of thinking.	Nze mbadde nkola nnyo okulowooza.
I knew what he wanted.	Nnali mmanyi kye yali ayagala.
Nothing was the way he expected it to be.	Tewali kyali mu ngeri gye yali asuubira nti kijja kuba.
I thought that was a great idea	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo
But no, nothing.	Naye nedda, tewali kintu kyonna.
And you can’t get enough.	Era tosobola kumala.
I was the reason for that	Nze nali ensonga lwaki ekyo
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
I just want to talk to him	Njagala kwogera naye kyokka
This is what I have so far.	Kino kye nnina okutuusa kati.
It’s not my issue.	Si nsonga yange.
He could do no such thing.	Yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna ng’ekyo.
No one wants to talk.	Tewali ayagala kwogera.
When was this.	Kino kyali ddi.
I can’t really be with him and do much	Mu butuufu sisobola kubeera naye ne nkola bingi
We need it every day now.	Twetaaga buli lunaku kati.
He has no idea, of course.	Talina kirowoozo kyonna, ddala.
Here and there.	Wano ne wali.
I need to see everything	Nze nneetaaga okulaba buli kimu
I thought he was my friend	Nalowooza nti ye mukwano gwange
I didn’t want to get in trouble	Nnali saagala kufuna buzibu
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He wants to go.	Ayagala kugenda.
I was ready to talk to him again	Nnali mwetegefu okuddamu okwogera naye
And that was that.	Era ekyo kye kyali ekyo.
He needed help with me.	Yali yeetaaga obuyambi nange.
And that’s where it matters.	Era awo we kikulu.
I was terrified myself	Nze kennyini nnali ntya nnyo
I didn’t know what he wanted	Nali simanyi kye yali ayagala
I just need to talk to you	Nze nneetaaga kwogera naawe kyokka
Image is a powerful thing.	Ekifaananyi kintu kya maanyi.
You’re not you.	Ggwe si gwe.
I think.	Ndowooza.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
I don’t know how to do it	Simanyi ngeri ya kukikola
You don’t even have to talk to me.	Tolina na kwogera nange.
He was certainly very knowledgeable.	Mazima ddala yali amanyi nnyo.
I didn’t know what it was at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi kye kyali
That was easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu.
This was a real thing.	Kino kyali kintu kya ddala.
I just wanted to know about one thing	Nnali njagala kumanya ku kintu kimu kyokka
In reality this is not the case.	Mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
It’s a matter of opinion.	Ensonga ya ndowooza.
I couldn’t believe it	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti kyali kituufu
It would actually be very dangerous.	Mu butuufu kyandibadde kya bulabe nnyo.
He knew he didn’t have long.	Yali akimanyi nti talina bbanga ddene.
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
Despite all of it.	Wadde nga byonna.
There are so many opinions.	Waliwo endowooza nnyingi nnyo.
I know what’s going on now	Nze mmanyi ekigenda mu maaso kati
But surely everyone knows that.	Naye mazima ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I can’t speak properly.	Sisobola kwogera bulungi.
It was great for us.	Kyali kirungi nnyo gye tuli.
Beauty.	Obulungi.
He had something he didn’t have.	Yalina ekintu kye yali talina.
Not my house, not my house.	Si nnyumba yange, si nnyumba yange.
He said you know.	Yagambye nti omanyi.
It was time to move on.	Kyali kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
I won’t be back in the office until next week	Sijja kudda mu ofiisi okutuusa wiiki ejja
I can’t say much much right now	Siyinza kwogera bingi bingi mu kiseera kino
I didn’t know how to be a man	Nali simanyi kubeera musajja
He said he didn't.	Yagambye nti nedda.
I wanted to be a teacher	Nnali njagala kubeera musomesa
It was for the day.	Yali ya lunaku.
And he knew it.	Era yali akimanyi.
I’m afraid not very long at all	Ntya si bbanga ddene nnyo n’akatono
That’s great, of course.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo, ddala bwe kiri.
It’s important to us, too.	Kikulu gye tuli, naffe.
I didn’t have any girlfriends	Nnali sirina muganzi yenna
I will be there, but not too close	Nja kubeerawo, naye si kumpi nnyo
I hope he is just my friend	Nsuubira nti ye mukwano gwange yekka
I didn’t really feel anything	Mu butuufu nnali sirina kye mpulira
I don’t go to school	Sigenda ku ssomero
No you can’t.	Nedda tosobola.
I know this all too well	Kino nkimanyi bulungi nnyo
I think that’s what he said	Ndowooza ekyo kye yayogera
Mostly that’s not for me to do.	Okusinga ekyo si kyange okukola.
I’m going to do it anyway.	Ngenda kukikola mu ngeri yonna.
He is a good person.	Ye muntu mulungi.
That was as it was.	Ekyo kyali nga bwe kiri.
For me it was really easy to do that.	Nze ddala kyali kyangu okukola ekyo.
I was so excited to see the movie	Nnali musanyufu nnyo okulaba firimu eyo
I don't know why.	Ensonga lwaki simanyi.
You have to deal with that problem.	Olina okukola ku kizibu ekyo.
He wouldn’t have been able to do it.	Yandibadde tasobola kukikola.
No, we need to read.	Nedda, twetaaga okusoma.
I was afraid to be alone	Nnali ntya okubeera nzekka
Can work here, though.	Asobola okukola wano, wadde.
I'm so glad he got the chance to talk to you.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti yafuna omukisa okwogera naawe.
What! 	Kiki!
I’m sure he’ll do well.	Nkakasa nti ajja kukola bulungi.
I think it looks really good one now	Ndowooza kirabika bulungi ddala emu kati
No, little by little.	Nedda, katono katono.
It seems complicated but it isn’t.	Kirabika kizibu naye si bwe kiri.
I will be a good man	Nja kuba musajja mulungi
I hear you.	Mpulira.
I knew something like this would happen	Nali nkimanyi nti ekintu nga kino kijja kubaawo
I wanted all of that	Ebyo byonna nnali njagala
You can go eat.	Osobola okugenda okulya.
I need to come home	Nze nneetaaga okudda awaka
I'll come with you	Nja kujja naawe
I think it will be an easy thing.	Ndowooza nti kijja kuba kintu kyangu.
That’s basically what we have here.	Ekyo okusinga kye tulina wano.
I just can’t wait to see what happens	Siyinza kumala kulinda kulaba kigenda mu maaso
He knew where he was.	Yali amanyi gye yali.
I wasn’t sure if he did or not	Nnali sikakasa oba yakikola oba nedda
It looks like it will be very powerful.	Kirabika kijja kuba kya maanyi nnyo.
You just have to work.	Olina okukola kyokka.
He knows better than anyone.	Amanyi bulungi okusinga omuntu yenna.
I didn’t even know why.	Nnali simanyi na nsonga lwaki.
Whoever does.	Oyo akola.
A little, anyway	Katono, mu ngeri yonna
I was happy that everything was going well	Nali musanyufu nti buli kimu kyali kigenda bulungi
That's not why.	Si y'ensonga lwaki.
But each on their own method!.	Naye buli omu ku nkola ye!.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
But you can’t do anything about it.	Naye tosobola kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
You don’t have much time.	Tolina budde bungi.
I feel like they’re around all the time	Mpulira nga bali kumpi buli kiseera
I love to win.	Njagala nnyo okuwangula.
And yet it isn’t.	Era naye si bwe kiri.
You know that, but it’s not.	Ekyo okimanyi naye si bwe kiri.
It’s very, very bad.	Kibi nnyo nnyo.
I have always been gay	Bulijjo mbadde muganzi
It was real, real close.	Yali ya ddala, ya ddala kumpi.
But I’m pretty sure there isn’t.	Naye nkakasa nnyo nti tewali.
I wanted to be myself	Nnali njagala kubeera nze kennyini
She was not yet his wife.	Yali tannaba mukyala we.
I know what kind of person you are	Nze mmanyi omuntu wa ngeri ki gy’oli
He says he doesn’t want anything about her in his office.	Agamba nti tayagala kintu kyonna ku ye mu ofiisi ye.
I wasn’t going to wait any longer	Nnali sigenda kuddamu kulinda
I knew exactly what he was doing	Nali mmanyi bulungi kye yali akola
I know exactly where they are	Nze mmanyi bulungi gye bali
She wants to be him.	Ayagala kubeera ye.
You are on your own agenda.	Oli ku agenda yo.
And this is why.	Era eno y’ensonga lwaki...
In theory that’s a good idea.	Mu ndowooza ekyo kirowoozo kirungi.
That’s still not easy.	Ekyo n’okutuusa kati si kyangu.
Actually, there is no money.	Mu butuufu, tewali ssente.
But he's a good kid.	Naye mwana mulungi.
We have to go with him.	Tulina okugenda naye.
I doubt we’ll do much of that again	Nbuusabuusa nti tujja kuddamu okukola bingi ku ebyo
I was ready to go home	Nnali mwetegefu okudda eka
I wanted to know where it was	Nnali njagala okumanya gye kyali
It was definitely him.	Mazima ddala ye yali ye.
There is nothing like this.	Tewali kintu nga kino.
Difficult or easy.	Kizibu oba kyangu.
Everyone wants one.	Buli omu ayagala emu.
I can’t do that right now	Ekyo sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino
He did this, but he did.	Kino yakikola, naye yakikola.
It will be .	Kijja kuba .
She would be my wife.	Yandibadde mukyala wange.
Not now, not now.	Si kati, si kati.
I’ll be home tonight, or early tomorrow.	Nja kudda awaka ekiro kino, oba enkya nga bukyali.
I love the whole thing	Njagala nnyo ekintu kyonna
I’m doing pretty well.	Nkola bulungi nnyo.
From his house.	Okuva mu nnyumba ye.
No one needs to know.	Tewali yeetaaga kumanya.
I don’t know if he was in the room.	Simanyi oba yali mu kisenge.
And I could talk to him.	Era nnali nsobola okwogera naye.
Back to you.	Okudda gy’oli.
I know I knew what that was	Nkimanyi nnali mmanyi ekyo kye kyali
I want to see everything good in a person	Njagala okulaba buli kirungi mu muntu
He was really here.	Ddala yali wano.
Or he was, anyway.	Oba yali, mu ngeri yonna.
I was a kid, you know	Nnali mwana muto, omanyi
Not so today.	Si bwe kiri leero.
And anyone does it.	Era omuntu yenna akikola.
You are going very well.	Ogenda bulungi nnyo.
I really wanted to have dinner with you	Nnali njagala nnyo okulya naawe ekyeggulo
As he always knew it was.	Nga bwe yali akimanyi bulijjo bwe kyali.
I thought this would be too hard	Nalowooza nti kino kyandibadde kizibu nnyo
This was excellent.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
No one had a lot of money.	Tewali yalina ssente nnyingi.
This was a good thing.	Kino kyali kirungi.
However, I know this	Kyokka kino nkimanyi
I wonder if this is true	Nze nneebuuza oba kino kituufu
I wanted to be around him	Nnali njagala kubeera kumpi naye
And now he won’t.	Era kati tajja kukikola.
You have to know.	Olina okumanya.
I have no idea what that is	Ekyo sirina kye mmanyi ku ki
It’s not just one thing.	Si kintu kimu kyokka.
It almost feels like home	Katono mpulira nga ndi waka
You won’t be able to do a little more.	Tojja kusobola kukola katono nnyo.
Apparently this is real.	Kirabika kino kya ddala.
But he wanted to.	Kyokka yali ayagala.
I couldn’t even do that	Ekyo nnali sisobola wadde okukikola
I have no idea if you can or not	Sirina kye mmanyi oba osobola oba nedda
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
Honestly, this was a good thing.	Mu butuufu, kino kyali kintu kirungi.
No one talked to me in the office.	Tewali yayogera nange mu ofiisi.
And I pray.	Era nsaba.
I’ll get back to you in the morning	Nja kudda gy’oli ku makya
I can see so much this way.	Nsobola okulaba bingi nnyo mu ngeri eno.
And this is not uncommon.	Era kino si kya bulijjo.
I was just happy.	Nali musanyufu kyokka.
Good thing, he knew it wasn't him.	Kirungi, yali akimanyi nti si ye.
And it probably was, but you’re the reason why.	Era osanga bwe kyali, naye ggwe ensonga lwaki.
But he would have to.	Naye yandibadde alina okukikola.
It’s really really really hard.	Ddala ddala ddala kizibu.
I’m here with my brother	Nze ndi wano ne muganda wange
We have to move on here.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso wano.
I'll wait here.	Nja kulinda wano.
I don’t want to have any problems again.	Saagala kuddamu kufuna buzibu bwonna.
You don’t know.	Tomanyi.
For that matter, he was.	Ku nsonga eyo, naye bwe yali.
I still can’t.	N’okutuusa kati sisobola.
He was that man.	Yali musajja oyo.
Or it will happen.	Oba kijja kubaawo.
I was just thinking the same thing	Nze nali ndowooza kye kimu kyokka
No, you don’t really have to do everything yourself.	Nedda, tolina ddala kukola buli kimu wekka.
I am not lucky with this either	Kino nange sirina mukisa
But three weeks is a long time to be without.	Naye wiiki ssatu bbanga ddene okubeera nga tolina.
He felt very comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo.
I have to get to my office soon	Nnina okutuuka mangu mu ofiisi yange
That’s what he told me.	Ekyo yang’amba.
I need money today.	Ssente nneetaaga leero.
Very good to read.	Mulungi nnyo okusoma.
A really good friend.	Mukwano omulungi ddala.
I didn’t want anything	Nnali sirina kye nnali njagala
He knows this.	Kino akimanyi.
And so he did.	Era bw’atyo bwe yakola.
I didn’t want to be alone all the time	Nnali saagala kubeera nzekka buli kiseera
He was a nice guy.	Yali ggaayi mulungi.
I’m fine with this.	Nze kino ndi bulungi.
He says you can go home.	Agamba nti osobola okudda eka.
I knew he loved my father	Nali nkimanyi nti yali ayagala nnyo taata
I didn’t even know what was going to happen	Nnali simanyi na kigenda kubaawo
He certainly was.	Mazima ddala yali.
But of course he could get to you.	Naye ddala yali asobola okutuuka gy’oli.
I didn’t care about my wife	Nnali sifaayo ku mukyala wange
And he was doing a very good job.	Era yali akola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
He had to do it.	Yali alina okukikola.
The problem is that it’s nothing of the sort.	Obuzibu buli nti si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
I think it looks great	Ndowooza kirabika bulungi nnyo
I knew nothing about him or about	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye oba ku
I knew something was going to happen	Namanya nti waliwo ekigenda okubaawo
I can see the point.	Nsobola okulaba ensonga.
And it was true.	Era kyali kituufu.
I want to talk about that	Njagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo
Then it was time to wait.	Awo nga kiseera kya kulinda.
Really.	Kituufu.
I want to be ready for anything	Njagala kubeera mwetegefu okukola ekintu kyonna
I have to know.	Nnina okumanya.
I think it was too fast	Ndowooza kyali kya mangu nnyo
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
I can’t be thinking about you either	Nange siyinza kuba nga ndowooza ku ggwe
I had been an only child too	Nange nnali mbadde mwana yekka
I knew nothing about it	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo
I was moving on now	Nali ngenda mu maaso kati
And this picture.	Era ekifaananyi kino.
Nothing for either of us.	Tewali kintu kyonna ku ffembi.
We were really into that.	Ddala twali mu ekyo.
He can be busy.	Asobola okuba nga bbize.
I think he's afraid to do it alone	Ndowooza atya okukikola yekka
I do have a point.	Nze ddala nnina ensonga.
In reality, however, this is not the case.	Kyokka mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
I know where this is going	Kino nkimanyi gye kigenda
I am not alone in this	Si nze nzekka mu kino
You can barely see.	Osobola bulungi okulaba.
That’s what he said.	Ekyo kye yayogera.
However, he didn’t know exactly.	Kyokka yali tamanyi bulungi.
I wanted to say things	Nnali njagala okwogera ebintu
That's an 'idea.	Ekyo 'kirowoozo.
While we are here.	Nga tuli wano.
I don’t want to go without you	Saagala kugenda nga tolina
Indeed he was.	Mazima yali.
I think he is really sick	Ndowooza ddala mulwadde
I could do this	Kino nnali nsobola okukikola
I always do, you know	Bulijjo nkola, omanyi
He will be there.	Ajja kubeerawo.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
Everything.	Buli kimu.
I wondered whatever he wanted	Nneebuuza kyonna kye yali ayagala
He'll be home soon.	Ajja kudda awaka mu bbanga ttono.
He saw things he shouldn’t have seen.	Yalaba ebintu bye yali tasaanidde kulaba.
I love my job	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwange
Downstairs I was working alone	Wansi nnali nkola nzekka
I am not dangerous to you	Siri wa bulabe gy’oli
This is a difficult time.	Kino kiseera kizibu.
But not much help.	Naye si buyambi bungi.
I have been very busy	Mbadde bbize nnyo
I really don’t know why.	Mu butuufu simanyi lwaki.
I hope everything is okay	Nsuubira nti buli kimu kiri bulungi
That he would do that.	Nti ekyo yandikoze.
It’s time to act.	Kye kiseera okukola.
Not here.	Si wano.
I’m not good enough.	Nze siri mulungi.
I will try to do the same here	Nja kugezaako okukola kye kimu wano
I’ve always had it	Bulijjo mbadde nfunye
I knew you would agree	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kukkiriza
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I was always a friendly person	Bulijjo nnali muntu wa mukwano
I knew you would be here	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kuba wano
I thought about what he said, and it was true	Nnalowooza ku bye yayogera era kyali kituufu
Everyone except me.	Buli muntu okuggyako nze.
Everyone does the same thing	Buli muntu akola ekintu kye kimu
But it’s not true.	Naye si kituufu.
I should have done it already	Nnali nsaanidde okukikola dda
I really don’t know.	Mazima ddala simanyi.
There is no easy answer.	Tewali kyangu kya kuddamu.
That’s unusual for something.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo ku kintu.
I didn’t even know what it was	Nnali simanyi na kye kyali
This isn’t just me.	Kino si nze nzekka.
I know what they really are	Nze mmanyi kye bali ddala
I thought he was from here	Nalowooza nti yali wa wano
It won’t be the same.	Tekijja kuba kye kimu.
But there is that it is.	Naye waliwo nti bwe kiri.
I am very well and very happy.	Ndi bulungi nnyo era ndi musanyufu nnyo.
It’s a conceptual thing.	Kintu kya ndowooza.
I didn’t know what I was doing with him	Nali simanyi kye nkola naye
I knew it was a bad idea	Namanya nti kyali kirowoozo kibi
I don’t want to be here.	Saagala kubeera wano.
He must be doing well.	Alina okuba ng’akola bulungi.
I couldn’t be happier	Nnali siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo
We are friends.	Tuli ba mukwano.
He can’t help anyone right now.	Tasobola kuyamba muntu yenna mu kiseera kino.
What would he do anyway.	Kiki kye yandikoze mu ngeri yonna.
We will do that.	Ekyo tujja kukikola.
He had nothing to do.	Yali talina kya kukola.
I guess it’s up to me	Ntebereza nti kiri gyendi
He loved the movie.	Firimu eyo yali ayagala nnyo.
I think he was on to something.	Ndowooza yali ku kintu.
However, I am being real	Kyokka, ndi kubeera wa ddala
It was a powerful feeling.	Yali mpulira ya maanyi nnyo.
There is nothing unusual about this.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo ku nsonga eno.
Did he know it? 	Yali akimanyi?
We have to do this together.	Kino tulina okukikola nga tuli wamu.
I wanted both of them	Bombi nnali njagala
I guess we’ll see.	Ntebereza tujja kulaba.
Maybe even for me.	Mpozzi ne ku nze.
Maybe now he will do his job.	Mpozzi kati ajja kukola omulimu gwe.
I didn’t really have an answer for that	Mu butuufu nnali sirina kya kuddamu ku ekyo
Each of us has our issues.	Buli omu ffe alina ensonga ze.
That was a very difficult time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
There are many reasons why.	Waliwo ensonga nnyingi lwaki...
I didn’t know he was sick	Nze nali simanyi nti mulwadde
I didn’t want to do it.	Nnali saagala kukikola.
You don’t quite know what to say.	Tomanyi bulungi kya kwogera.
I am a very ordinary person	Ndi muntu wa bulijjo nnyo
We absolutely have.	Tulina ddala.
No serious reason for him.	Tewali nsonga ya maanyi eri ye.
I wasn’t going to be normal	Nze nali sigenda kubeera wa bulijjo
I just need it	Nze kye nneetaaga kyokka
I think there is something	Nze ndowooza nti waliwo ekintu kyonna
I will never do that again	Ekyo sijja kuddamu kukikola
That is very important to us.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
I love to eat.	Njagala nnyo okulya.
I still can’t believe he did that	N’okutuusa kati siyinza kukkiriza nti ekyo yakikola
Nobody really did it.	Tewali muntu yenna yakikola ddala.
You are yourself.	Ggwe ggwe kennyini.
He knew how important this was.	Yali akimanyi nti kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
If that.	Bwe ekyo.
For me, I wished it wasn’t	Nze, nnali njagala nga si bwe kiri
No plans, yet.	Tewali nteekateeka yonna, n’okutuusa kati.
I hope there is nothing wrong with me	Nsuubira nti tewali kizibu kyonna gyendi
I used to think as well.	Nze nnali ndowooza nga bwe kiri.
He wasn’t going back to the house.	Yali tagenda kudda mu nnyumba.
He knew his job.	Yali amanyi omulimu gwe.
I love this job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu guno.
But no, it wasn’t.	Naye nedda, si bwe yali.
That wasn’t his point.	Eyo si ye yali ensonga ye.
I thought the police were coming	Nalowooza nti poliisi ejja
Not even in his class.	Si wadde mu kibiina kye.
I feel so good to be around	Nze mpulira bulungi nnyo okubeera nange
This is up to you.	Kino kiri gy’oli.
He was with me.	Yali nange.
I actually do all the time	Mu butuufu nkola buli kiseera
I love my dad too	Nze nange njagala ne taata wange
No one came home.	Tewali yajja waka.
Exactly where doesn’t matter.	Ddala wa si kikulu.
This is my work so far.	Guno gwe mulimu gwange okutuusa kati.
Everything was just the same.	Buli kimu kyali kye kimu kyokka.
I’m doing fine.	Nze nkola bulungi.
He must be like me.	Alina okuba nga nze.
In theory, it would be great here.	Mu ndowooza, wano kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I will never talk to him again	Sijja kuddamu kwogera naye
I didn’t know what he was going to do	Nnali simanyi kye yali agenda kukola
Or anything else.	Oba ekintu kyonna.
Not for the money.	Si lwa ssente.
I need to go home for real	Nze nneetaaga okudda eka mu butuufu
That’s actually true.	Ekyo mu butuufu kituufu.
This isn’t mine.	Kino si kyange.
That to me was good.	Ekyo gyendi kyali kirungi.
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo nnyo
And we can’t do that.	Era ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
I really didn’t want to know	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kumanya
This is not the case here.	Kino si bwe kiri wano.
But in reality this was not the case.	Naye mu butuufu kino si bwe kyali.
He was alone, just like before.	Yali yekka, nga bwe kyali emabegako.
I am not my brother.	Siri muganda wange.
I love doing this	Kino njagala nnyo okukikola
And in a very short time.	Era mu bbanga ttono ddala.
I knew immediately where we were	Namanya amangu ddala gye twali
But now it seems this is not the case.	Naye kati kirabika kino si bwe kiri.
That one person was going to be me.	Oyo omuntu omu yali agenda kubeera nze.
I’m afraid, of course.	Nze ntya, ddala.
I said of course not	Nagamba nti ddala si bwe kiri
You’re going to be in the party.	Ogenda kubeera mu mbaga.
There was something he didn’t like.	Waliwo ekintu kye yali tayagala.
Or no, no, no.	Oba nedda, nedda, nedda.
I hope you can live here	Nsuubira nti osobola okubeera wano
Might not yet be the case.	Ayinza okuba nga n’okutuusa kati si bwe kiri.
And that has to be me.	Era oyo alina okuba nze.
I wanted another guy	Nnali njagala ggaayi omulala
But it’s more complicated than that.	Naye kizibu okusinga ekyo.
I was ready to make one exception	Nali mwetegefu okuggyako ekintu kimu
And he wanted to come, he said.	Era yali ayagala kujja, bwe yagambye.
I know everything now.	Buli kimu nkimanyi kati.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
I thought we were friends	Nnalowooza nti tuli ba mukwano
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
Yeah and yeah.	Ye ne ye .
From here on out.	Okuva wano.
But we can.	Naye tusobola.
It doesn’t matter which side they are on.	Si kikulu nti bali ku ludda ki.
This was normal.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo.
I feel like a real man now.	Mpulira nga musajja ddala kati.
Just a regular guy.	Ggaayi wa bulijjo yekka.
You have to do it quickly.	Olina okukikola mu bwangu.
I guess that might be true in my case	Ntebereza nti ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu mu mbeera yange
I wanted to be these things	Nnali njagala okubeera ebintu bino
You want this, you have this, you want this you have this.	Oyagala kino, olina kino, oyagala kino olina kino.
In any case.	Mu ngeri yonna.
I thought maybe everything could be okay	Nalowooza nti osanga buli kimu kiyinza okuba nga kirungi
But, that doesn’t matter.	Naye, ekyo si kikulu.
I can’t do that now	Ekyo kati sisobola kukikola
And there is no answer.	Era tewali kuddamu.
I wonder if we can do it	Nze nneebuuza oba tusobola okukikola
If someone could find a good one.	Singa omuntu asobola okufuna omulungi.
I needed to think.	Nnali nneetaaga okulowooza.
I knew it even then.	Nnali nkimanyi ne mu kiseera ekyo.
He doesn’t have to come here.	Talina kujja wano.
Probably, he thought.	Oboolyawo, bwe yalowooza.
That may have been true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kyali kituufu.
They were friendly.	Baali ba mukwano.
Same thing with me.	Ekintu kye kimu ne nange.
The house is in good condition.	Ennyumba eri mu mbeera nnungi.
I had no problem with that	Ekyo nnali sirina buzibu bwonna
Now I can talk to you about everything.	Kati nsobola okwogera naawe ku buli kimu.
Nothing was too dangerous	Tewali kyali kya bulabe nnyo
He didn't know what to say.	Yali tamanyi kya kwogera.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He had been asleep as well.	Yali abadde yeebase nga naye.
They are in town now.	Bali mu kibuga kati.
I just needed a teacher	Nnali nneetaaga musomesa yekka
Not as it is now.	Si nga bwe kiri kati.
I think he’ll be fine	Ndowooza ajja kuba bulungi
I love talking to him	Njagala nnyo okwogera naye
He will believe anything.	Ajja kukkiriza ekintu kyonna.
I can’t allow it to happen	Sisobola kukkiriza kubaawo
It’s not exactly true.	Si kituufu ddala.
I need to talk to you about something	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe ku kintu
I can’t believe he’s here	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ali wano
But he's an artist, too.	Naye muyimbi, naye.
He can tell everyone.	Ayinza okubuulira buli muntu.
I knew nothing about him at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye
We don’t have time.	Tetulina budde.
I really wanted it too	Nange nnali njagala ddala
I will always be there	Nja kubeerawo bulijjo
It was just the two of us this morning.	Twali ffembi ffekka enkya ya leero.
Now he was asleep.	Kati yali yeebase.
Isn’t that a thing? 	Ekyo si kintu?
But this would be too easy.	Naye kino kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
I am going at the moment	Nze ngenda mu kiseera kino
The dog was there.	Embwa yali awo.
I didn’t think it was serious	Nnali sirowooza nti kyali kya maanyi
You can’t see a bit of a bad spot.	Tosobola kulaba katono ku kifo kibi.
However, I felt nothing	Kyokka, nnali sirina kye mpulira
In any case, you’re going to have to do the thing.	Mu mbeera yonna, ogenda kuba olina okukola ekintu ekyo.
It’s very, very simple.	Kyangu nnyo nnyo.
I think you’ll be fine.	Ndowooza ojja kuba bulungi.
It's good though.	Kirungi wadde.
Thinking about that.	Okulowooza ekyo.
And he is at work now.	Era ali ku mulimu kati.
I still didn’t even have a car	N’okutuusa kati nnali sirina wadde mmotoka
I don't know.	Simanyi.
We can’t continue to live this way, Dad.	Tetusobola kugenda mu maaso na kubeera mu ngeri eno taata.
In fact, this seems completely true to me.	Mu butuufu kino kirabika nga kituufu ddala gyendi.
He was very fast.	Yali wa bwangu nnyo.
However, I didn’t have it either	Kyokka nange nnali sirina
That’s really bad, but we can’t do it.	Ekyo ddala kibi naye tetusobola kukikola.
I was doing this.	Kino nnali nkola.
I was working hard.	Nnali nkola nnyo.
I don’t have time.	Sirina budde.
I had no idea how to go about doing that	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ngeri gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso nga nkola ekyo
I was feeling like myself	Nali mpulira nga nze kennyini
Good job.	Omulimu omulungi.
It’s better to go without.	Kirungi okugenda nga tolina.
I'm sure now.	Nkakasa kati.
And she can’t find a man.	Era tasobola kufuna musajja.
This movie is great.	Firimu eno nnungi nnyo.
We need a reason.	Twetaaga ensonga.
I didn’t know what exactly	Nnali simanyi kiki ddala
Everyone knew who he was.	Buli omu yali amanyi ani.
No, maybe asleep.	Nedda, mpozzi nga yeebase.
I’ve always loved it	Bulijjo mbadde njagala nnyo
I don't think he is though.	Sirowooza nti ye wadde.
I am happy to help.	Ndi musanyufu okuyamba.
I have no idea how to go about this.	Sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri gye nnyinza kugenda mu nsonga eno.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
This is a very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
I thought only of myself	Nalowooza ku nze nzekka
You can see where this is going.	Osobola okulaba kino gye kigenda.
There he was alone.	Eyo yekka gye yali.
We just need to wait.	Twetaaga kulinda kyokka.
I can't find a good way to do this though.	Sisobola kufuna ngeri nnungi ya kukola kino wadde.
Or that is the theory.	Oba eyo ye ndowooza.
And it seems.	Era kirabika.
I can't 'stay with you.	Sisobola 'kusigala naawe.
I hope you love it	Nsuubira nti oyagala nnyo
I am the only one.	Nze nze nzekka.
I think he's fine.	Ndowooza ali bulungi.
It is everywhere.	Kiri buli wamu.
I have to be with you there.	Nnina okubeera naawe awo.
He really wants to talk to you.	Mazima ddala ayagala okwogera naawe.
That one comes down.	Oyo ajja wansi.
We should be fine though.	Tulina okuba bulungi wadde.
I used to live here.	Nze nali mbeera wano.
I guess they’re pretty good	Ntebereza nti bali bulungi nnyo
I’m making a movie.	Nze nkola firimu.
Perhaps he had.	Oboolyawo yalina.
But he could do it.	Naye yali asobola okukikola.
I didn’t know what to do	Nnali simanyi kya kukola
When you are not in the hospital.	Nga toli mu ddwaaliro.
I didn’t want all this	Bino byonna nali saagala
I guess they’re everywhere	Ntebereza nti bali buli wamu
I want to be my man	Njagala kubeera musajja wange
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
Then he knew what the problem was.	Awo n’amanya ekizibu kye kyali.
I just need to talk to you	Nze nneetaaga kwogera naawe kyokka
I knew it was coming.	Namanya nti kijja.
This is a complex problem.	Kino kizibu kizibu.
I wonder if that was normal	Nneebuuza oba ekyo kyali kya bulijjo
I was nervous and hopeful	Nnali ntya era nga nnina essuubi
He will be asleep.	Ajja kuba yeebase.
Obviously not now.	Kya lwatu si kati.
I need all the things	Nneetaaga ebintu byonna
This may be going away.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kigenda.
I’m not even sure about myself.	Nze sikakasa wadde ku nze.
I can’t see how he could know	Sisobola kulaba ngeri gye yali asobola okumanya
I want to be with him	Njagala kubeera naye
There you are.	Eyo gy’oli.
I was convinced this wasn’t always the case	Nali nkakasa nti kino si kye kyali bulijjo
I was happy at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali musanyufu
Maybe it will help.	Mpozzi nga kijja kuyamba.
Not me, certainly.	Si nze, mazima ddala.
Glad you like it.	Musanyufu nti oyagala.
I have nothing to do with that	Ekyo sirina kye nnyinza kukola
But we all should.	Naye ffenna tusaanidde.
Thinking is good for you.	Okulowooza kirungi gy’oli.
I think you have a problem.	Ndowooza olina ekizibu.
Only you can know that.	Ekyo ggwe wekka asobola okumanya.
These.	Bino.
But it wasn’t like that for me.	Naye si bwe kyali gyendi.
He certainly did, he said.	Mazima ddala yakikola, bwe yagambye.
You were going to be a doctor.	Ggwe wali ogenda kubeera musawo.
I didn’t have time for that, though	Kyokka ekyo nnali sirina budde bwa kukikola
In my office.	Mu ofiisi yange.
I think he is the problem.	Ndowooza ye buzibu.
I needed to go get help	Nnali nneetaaga okugenda okufuna obuyambi
It was really happening.	Ddala kyali kigenda mu maaso.
He seems to have fallen asleep at work.	Alabika yeebase ku mulimu.
But he only saw one.	Naye yalaba omu yekka.
I will be good too	Nange nja kuba mulungi
But this is very difficult.	Naye kino kizibu nnyo.
And these .	Era bino .
Right now, no one has any idea.	Mu kiseera kino, tewali alina kirowoozo kyonna.
I don’t want to wait until we are.	Saagala kulinda okutuusa nga ffe.
I’m not sure if that’s a bad thing	Sikakasa oba ekyo kintu kibi
I know you want that	Nkimanyi nti ekyo oyagala
On weekends, mostly.	Ku wiikendi, okusinga.
But it’s not that.	Naye si ekyo.
But it was a good place.	Naye kyali kifo kirungi.
We don’t have much time.	Tetulina budde bungi.
I just wanted to talk to him.	Nnali njagala kwogera naye kyokka.
Obviously they were.	Kya lwatu nti baali.
I need to think of something	Nze nneetaaga okulowooza ku kintu
I only ask the same from you in return	Nze nsaba kye kimu kyokka okuva gy’oli mu kuddamu
And that will continue to be the case	Era ekyo kijja kusigala nga bwe kiri
But not now.	Naye si kati.
. . . .	.
I feel very strong.	Mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi nnyo.
I was like my father	Nze nali nga taata wange
But in practice, it’s not so easy.	Naye mu nkola, si kyangu nnyo.
I had no idea about this	Kino nnali sirina kye mmanyi
I was very close to him	Nali kumpi nnyo naye
He is very vulnerable.	Ali mu bulabe nnyo.
I knew you’d be right back	Namanya nti ojja kudda amangu ddala
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
I can do anything for three hours	Nsobola okukola ekintu kyonna okumala essaawa ssatu
I have no idea what that could be	Sirina kye mmanyi ekyo kye kiyinza okuba
I want to be here too	Nange njagala kubeera wano
I’m not feeling well.	Nze siri bulungi.
He could just go home.	Yali asobola okudda eka kyokka.
Please any help.	Nsaba obuyambi bwonna.
No, no, there’s something.	Nedda, nedda, waliwo ekintu.
He said he probably would.	Yagambye nti osanga ajja kukikola.
That doesn’t really matter.	Ekyo mu butuufu si kikulu.
However, I have to go	Kyokka nnina okugenda
Each of us wanted to be him.	Buli omu ku ffe yali ayagala okubeera ye.
I can never get away from it all	Siyinza n’akatono okuva mu byonna
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
I am with my friend.	Ndi ne mukwano gwange.
Must be there early today.	Alina okubaawo nga bukyali leero.
He was beautiful.	Yali mulungi.
I pray that it is not	Nsaba nti si bwe kiri
But he didn't think it would happen here.	Naye yali talowooza nti wano kijja kubaawo.
I need to think.	Nze nneetaaga okulowooza.
But, he did it anyway.	Naye, yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
No one knew he was here.	Tewali yali amanyi nti ali wano.
I couldn’t believe it, someone like me	Nali siyinza kukkiriza, omuntu nga nze
It’s not like that for everyone.	Si bwe kiri eri buli muntu.
He comes like tomorrow.	Ajja nga enkya.
This was going to be harder than he thought.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kizibu okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
You want to work.	Oyagala okukola.
I was much younger than him	Nze nnali muto nnyo okusinga ye
But it’s really important.	Naye ddala kikulu nnyo.
Although, this movie is a good watch.	Wadde, firimu eno essaawa nnungi.
Plenty of food.	Emmere nnyingi.
I didn’t know he was home	Nnali simanyi nti ali waka
Then another one.	Awo omulala.
You know how they are.	Omanyi bwe bali.
I'm not sure which.	Sikakasa ki.
Both of them.	Bombi bombi.
I can definitely see why	Nsobola okulaba ddala lwaki
He has to do it.	Alina okukikola.
I have to know.	Nnina okumanya.
Not everyone can do it.	Si buli muntu nti asobola okukikola.
He is a human being.	Ye muntu.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
I told just one friend.	Nagamba mukwano gwange omu yekka.
What we have is for today.	Kye tulina kya leero.
When, we shall see.	Ddi, tujja kulaba.
And there is no time.	Era tewali budde.
No one knows where he went or what he did.	Tewali amanyi gye yagenda wadde kye yakola.
Where is it located.	Kiri ludda wa.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
Surely, he would.	Mazima ddala, yandibadde.
He was alone.	Yali yekka.
I’m not going to say anything.	Sigenda kwogera kintu kyonna.
I needed to know this	Kino nnali nneetaaga okumanya
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
I guess he must have known	Ntebereza nti ateekwa okuba nga yali akimanyi
Maybe you really should go now.	Mpozzi ddala wandibadde ogenda kati.
That would be one thing.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu kimu.
I couldn’t see through.	Nnali sisobola kulaba mu.
I could go now.	Nnali nsobola okugenda kati.
On the went.	Ku yagenda.
He was in good shape.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi.
Or is there?.	Oba waliwo?.
I know it’s not true.	Nkimanyi nti si kituufu.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
It’s not about the situation.	Si kya mbeera.
Someone else has to do another job	Omuntu omulala alina okukola omulimu omulala
I was so so so happy he was with me	Nali musanyufu nnyo nnyo nnyo nti yali nange
I want to be human again	Njagala kuddamu kubeera muntu
In the same house.	Mu nnyumba emu.
I feel better today	Nze leero mpulira bulungi
I just want to talk to you	Njagala kwogera naawe wekka
I didn’t know what he would do	Nali simanyi kye yandikoze
I am not in any trouble	Siri mu buzibu bwonna
I hope you will make it as well	Nsuubira nti ojja kukikola nga bwe kiri
I knew he must be her dad	Namanya nti ateekwa okuba nga ye taata we
I didn’t know what to expect.	Nnali simanyi kye nsuubira.
My father and I.	Taata nange.
You know it’s nothing.	Omanyi nti si kintu kyonna.
You know what they are.	Omanyi kye bali.
But now he’s done.	Naye kati amaze.
Maybe a little bit of each of these.	Mpozzi nga katono ku buli kimu ku bino.
I think you shouldn’t	Ndowooza tolina kukikola
I was that child.	Nze nnali mwana oyo.
I think you’ll see why	Ndowooza ojja kulaba lwaki
I wanted to help everyone	Nnali njagala okuyamba buli muntu
I hope he doesn’t have to	Nsuubira nti talina kukikola
I just wanted to talk to him	Nnali njagala kwogera naye kyokka
I wasn’t going to say anything about him	Nnali sigenda kwogera kintu kyonna ku ye
I thought only of myself.	Nalowooza ku nze nzekka.
Education is their priority.	Okusoma kye kikulu nnyo gye bali.
That’s playful.	Ekyo kya kuzannya.
I think you can do it	Ndowooza osobola okukikola
No one knows more about energy than I do.	Tewali amanyi ku maanyi okusinga nze.
He has my job.	Alina omulimu gwange.
It’s just too complicated.	Kizibu nnyo kyokka.
But not now, not now.	Naye si kati, si kati.
We absolutely needed it.	Twali twetaaga ddala.
He has the power	Alina amaanyi
I just love watching this.	Njagala nnyo okulaba kino kyokka.
I love these very much.	Bino njagala nnyo.
And this is not the whole point.	Era eno si nsonga yonna.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
I could hardly believe it.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza nnyo.
I haven’t been taking care of myself	Nze mbadde sifaayo ku nze kennyini
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo nnyo
But not my father.	Naye si taata wange.
And you can’t either.	Era naawe tosobola.
He is very beautiful.	Ali mulungi nnyo.
I can’t do it.	Nze sisobola kukikola.
Here we go.	Wano we tugenda.
I just have to talk to him	Nnina okwogera naye nzekka
I will never work again	Sijja kuddamu kukola
There is no harm there.	Eyo tewali bulabe.
And no, it's not.	Era nedda.
There is no way that is going to happen.	Tewali ngeri ekyo gye kigenda kubaawo.
You can talk to me.	Osobola okwogera nange.
And it’s a matter of opinion, perhaps.	Era nsonga ya ndowooza, mpozzi.
I want to be a doctor like you	Njagala kubeera musawo nga ggwe
I couldn’t tell what it was	Nnali sisobola kumanya kye kyali
I knew immediately who it was	Namanya mangu ani
It won’t last long now.	Tekijja kumala bbanga ddene kati.
He said he was going to come.	Yagambye nti agenda kujja.
I can’t see anything about him	Sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna ku ye
I’m not the only one	Si nze nzekka
But I can’t do it.	Naye nze sisobola kukikola.
And he has it.	Era alina.
I probably won’t do it again	Oboolyawo sijja kuddamu kukikola
He'll be home tomorrow.	Ajja kudda waka enkya.
I have no one to fear	Sirina gwe ntya
And there’s nothing wrong with that.	Era ekyo tewali kibi kyonna.
I couldn’t tell what he was thinking	Nnali sisobola kumanya kye yali alowooza
I just want to go home.	Nze njagala kudda waka.
This is where the problem lies.	Wano obuzibu we buli.
You will love this.	Kino ojja kwagala nnyo.
Right now, he couldn’t.	Mu kiseera kino, yali tasobola.
He had no idea of ​​the distance.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku bbanga.
But they are in trouble.	Naye bali mu buzibu.
We’re in a hurry now.	Tuli mu bwangu kati.
As he was.	Nga bwe yali.
I don’t like it here or there	Sikyagala wano oba wali
It’s coming.	Kye kijja.
He is in everything.	Ali mu buli kimu.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
And that’s a problem.	Era ekyo kizibu.
Maybe it’s just him.	Mpozzi nga ye yekka.
I've been thinking.	Mbadde ndowooza.
Not for much.	Si ku bingi.
Will definitely answer.	Mazima ddala ajja kuddamu.
I have no idea if it was serious or not.	Sirina kye mmanyi oba kyali kya maanyi oba nedda.
I need to get one.	Nnina okufuna emu.
Indeed, he already has.	Mazima ddala, yalina dda.
He doesn’t think so.	Talowooza bw’atyo.
I actually like the guy.	Mu butuufu njagala nnyo ggaayi.
That’s all he has to do.	Ekyo kyokka ky’alina okukola.
And there is.	Era waliwo.
I wonder what the issue is with him	Nze nneebuuza ensonga eri ku ye
It was all he wanted.	Kyali ekyo kyokka kye yali ayagala.
A lot of money, friend.	Ssente nnyingi nnyo mukwano.
He was with me still.	Yali nange nga akyali.
It’s not just mine.	Si kyange kyokka.
He was planning all this.	Bino byonna yali ateekateeka.
I think that seems about right	Ndowooza ekyo kirabika nga kituufu
Not like it was.	Si nga bwe kyali.
I couldn’t have had a baby.	Nnali siyinza kuba nga nfunye mwana.
He thought it was pretty good.	Yalowooza nti kirungi nnyo.
But he is very good.	Naye mulungi nnyo.
I am ready to work right now	Ndi mwetegefu okukola mu kiseera kino
For me it was just an idea.	Nze kyali kirowoozo kyokka.
No one seems to be home at the moment.	Mu kiseera kino tewali alabika ali waka.
I know where you are	Nze mmanyi gyoli
He knew he could do it.	Yali akimanyi nti asobola okukikola.
I thought quickly.	Nalowooza mangu.
It’s hard to make a phone call.	Kizibu okukuba essimu.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
As a person.	Nga omuntu.
The image is very important.	Ekifaananyi kikulu nnyo.
I’ll do whatever you want	Nja kukola kyonna ky’oyagala
I will be right next to you	Nja kuba kumpi ddala naawe
But I don’t know how to do it.	Naye simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukikola.
I really didn’t know what to do.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kukola.
He said he knew it.	Yagambye nti akimanyi.
I want to know about this happening.	Njagala okumanya ku kino ekigenda mu maaso.
He was not ordinary.	Yali si wa bulijjo.
But it’s nothing major.	Naye si kintu kyonna kikulu.
I needed to know what was going on.	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya ekigenda mu maaso.
I hope it comes back	Nsuubira nti kijja kudda
Probably for the money.	Oboolyawo lwa ssente.
I was harmless	Nze nali sirina bulabe bwonna
It’s not the same thing.	Si kye kimu.
But he isn’t.	Naye si bw’atyo.
I know the day, the hour	Nze mmanyi olunaku, essaawa
He said he did it.	Yagambye nti yakikola.
This was a very serious matter.	Eno yali nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
That's why he's.	Y'ensonga lwaki ali...
I can’t deal with him, either	Nze nange sisobola kukola ku ye, era
But, you don’t have the money.	Naye, tolina ssente.
You are very fast.	Oli wa bwangu nnyo.
I can’t do that right now	Ekyo nze sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino
I didn’t know why.	Nnali simanyi lwaki.
I didn’t want to love anyone.	Nnali saagala kwagala muntu yenna.
I wonder if he would be here	Nze nneebuuza yandibadde wano
I need a moment to think	Nneetaaga akaseera okulowooza
He was that optimistic.	Yalina essuubi bw’atyo.
I almost never go to town	Kumpi sigenda mu kibuga
I know he’s nervous	Nkimanyi nti alina obuzibu
No one knows this.	Kino tewali akimanyi.
She looks really good.	Alabika bulungi ddala bulungi.
It is obviously very dangerous for them.	Kya lwatu nti kya bulabe nnyo gye bali.
I know you want this.	Nkimanyi nti kino oyagala.
I was ready to help.	Nnali mwetegefu okuyamba.
It’s easy to read.	Kyangu okusoma.
I don’t know what to expect.	Simanyi kye nsuubira.
He needed to know.	Yali yeetaaga okumanya.
I’m absolutely fine	Nze ndi bulungi ddala
I had no idea what to do	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kya kukola
I think you should come with me	Ndowooza wandibadde ojja nange
And, in a way, it was.	Era, mu ngeri emu, bwe kyali.
This may or may not have been true.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kyali kituufu oba nedda.
I could hardly believe it	Nnali sisobola n’akatono kukkiriza
Not for very long.	Si lwa bbanga ddene nnyo.
I wonder why he did it	Nneebuuza lwaki yakikola
You're mine.	Ggwe wange.
He would have to work now.	Yandibadde alina okukola kati.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
He said it didn't matter.	Yagambye nti si kikulu.
I can’t come with you	Sisobola kujja naawe
You, me, everybody.	Ggwe, nze, buli muntu.
I knew where he lived, now	Nali mmanyi gye yali abeera, kati
It’s not mine.	Si kyange.
That wasn’t what he wanted to be.	Ekyo si kye yali ayagala okubeera.
I couldn’t say anything	Nnali sisobola kwogera kintu kyonna
I'm fine.	Ndi bulungi.
It was a momentous occasion.	Kyali kiseera kikulu nnyo.
I didn’t know you were going to be here	Nali simanyi nti ogenda kubeera wano
He tried to speak.	Yagezaako okwogera.
That’s what’s important.	Ekyo kye kikulu.
I really like the idea of ​​this, in theory.	Mazima ddala njagala nnyo endowooza ya kino, mu ndowooza.
You can’t admit that to anyone.	Ekyo tosobola kukkiriza muntu yenna.
We’ll find someone else.	Tujja kufuna omuntu omulala.
Now you are in trouble.	Kati oli mu buzibu.
I want it there too	Njagala awo nange
I know it will work well	Nkimanyi nti kijja kukola bulungi
Not with this movie though.	Si ne firimu eno wadde.
I wanted this, whatever it was	Kino nnali njagala, kyonna kye kyali
I couldn’t do this thing	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kino
But that was the problem.	Naye ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
The way he was.	Engeri gye yali.
You’re not a father.	Ggwe toli taata.
Everyone there knows it too.	Buli ali eyo naye akimanyi.
You don’t want to know either.	Naawe toyagala kumanya.
But here it was.	Naye wano we kyali.
I always think .	Bulijjo ndowooza nti .
I could have gone alone.	Nnali nsobola okugenda nzekka.
He really wanted to talk to her today.	Yali ayagala nnyo okwogera naye leero.
But we will do well.	Naye tujja kukola bulungi.
I didn’t know he was so young.	Nnali simanyi nti yali muto nnyo.
He can’t go home.	Tasobola kudda waka.
I know much worse than you in my time	Mmanyi kibi nnyo okusinga ggwe mu kiseera kyange
I think he did it.	Ndowooza yakikola.
You will work here, and you will work hard.	Ojja kukola wano, era ojja kukola nnyo.
She told me she was very well and very happy.	Yang’amba nti yali bulungi nnyo era nga musanyufu nnyo.
I have no interest in you.	Sirina kye njagala ku ggwe.
You have to do it yourself.	Ggwe kennyini olina okukikola.
He thinks he is my girlfriend.	Alowooza nti ye muganzi wange.
I love to read.	Njagala nnyo okusoma.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
I was terrified myself	Nze kennyini nnali ntya nnyo
I think absolutely none	Nze ndowooza tewali n’akatono
That’s great, that’s good.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo, ekyo kirungi.
I wanted nothing of that and felt very scared	Ebyo nnali saagala kintu kyonna era nga mpulira nga ntya nnyo
And there’s one almost every day.	Era waliwo emu kumpi buli lunaku.
It was just for him.	Kyali kya ye yekka.
He hoped that would happen soon.	Yalina essuubi nti ekyo kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono.
I thought it was too dangerous for anyone	Nalowooza nti kyali kya bulabe nnyo eri omuntu yenna
I was working.	Nnali nkola.
Everyone is a movie.	Buli muntu abeera firimu.
I love you too	Naawe njagala nnyo
Really, it wasn’t.	Ddala, si bwe yali.
But that’s on the side.	Naye ekyo kiri ku ludda.
We needed a plan.	Twali twetaaga enteekateeka.
In fact, he wasn't.	Mu butuufu si bwe yali.
He must tell everything.	Ateekwa okubuulira byonna.
I think this is very important	Ndowooza kino kikulu nnyo
I think he knew it.	Ndowooza yali akimanyi.
I need to know exactly who he is	Nnina okumanya ddala ani
I love doing it	Njagala nnyo okukikola
I know what you would like to say if you could	Nkimanyi kye wandyagadde okwogera singa osobola
For that matter.	Ku nsonga eyo.
I was a little too fast	Nali wa bwangu nnyo katono
It will be good.	Kijja kuba kirungi.
And, it was certainly a good idea.	Era, mazima ddala kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
Maybe you have.	Mpozzi nga olina.
I know it will happen	Nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo
In the same place maybe, but nowhere.	Mu kifo kye kimu mpozzi, naye nga tewali wamu.
A picture or a book.	Ekifaananyi oba ekitabo.
I expected anything but not this	Nali nsuubira ekintu kyonna naye si kino
I am all that you are	Nze byonna ebyo bye ggwe
I think that’s what we’re getting to	Ndowooza ekyo kye tugenda okutuuka
And probably not for long.	Era oboolyawo si lwa bbanga ddene.
I know it and he knows it	Nze nkimanyi era naye akimanyi
I knew what he was doing.	Nnali mmanyi kye yali akola.
However, I didn’t know.	Kyokka nnali simanyi.
We have plenty of time.	Tulina obudde bungi.
I needed to address this	Kino nnali nneetaaga okukola ku nsonga eno
That’s what he did.	Bw’atyo bwe yakola.
However, this is not actually the case.	Kyokka, mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
And, of course not.	Era, ddala si bwe kiri.
Me and you.	Nze naawe.
Easy to make, easy to eat.	Kyangu okukola, kyangu okulya.
I knew he would be fine	Namanya nti ajja kuba bulungi
He is not at home.	Tali waka.
And he didn’t want to go.	Era yali tayagala kugenda.
You know you're supposed to be without.	Omanyi olina okubeera nga tolina.
This is not exactly the case.	Kino si bwe kiri ddala.
It would be difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu.
But it’s not mine.	Naye si kyange.
Not that it really matters.	Si nti ddala kikulu.
My wife agreed.	Mukyala wange yakkiriza.
I want someone who knows how to do it.	Njagala amanyi okukikola.
I hope we’ll be okay	Nsuubira nti tujja kuba bulungi
I have to go.	Nnina okugenda.
Knowing he shouldn’t.	Okumanya nti tasaanidde kukikola.
I can see so much this way	Nsobola okulaba bingi nnyo mu ngeri eno
I’m glad you’re interested	Ndi musanyufu nti oyagala
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
I couldn’t believe it would be the same	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti kijja kuba kye kimu
Surely he should have known earlier.	Mazima ddala yandibadde amanyi emabegako.
This is a job.	Guno mulimu.
Bye now!.	Bye kati!.
And it was a powerful moment.	Era kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
There is nothing wrong.	Tewali kintu kibi kyonna.
And it will be easier.	Era kijja kuba kyangu.
He will probably be fine.	Oboolyawo ajja kuba bulungi.
I’m everything a father can’t be	Nze buli kimu taata tayinza kubeera
You can see the house.	Osobola okulaba ennyumba.
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
That’s a good thing in many cases.	Ekyo kintu kirungi mu mbeera nnyingi.
But he will be there.	Naye ajja kubeerawo.
I thought this was a good idea	Nalowooza nti kino kyali kirowoozo kirungi
I really don’t know what to do now	Mazima ddala simanyi kya kukola kati
It was mine.	Yali wange.
A lot like you, actually.	Bingi nga ggwe, mu butuufu.
I think that’s a great idea	Ndowooza ekyo kirowoozo kirungi nnyo
I may be the same.	Nnyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
He has the money.	Alina ssente.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika nga mulungi nnyo.
I can really be myself.	Nsobola ddala okuba nze kennyini.
I can’t believe anyone would do this	Siyinza kukkiriza nti waliwo omuntu yenna yandikoze kino
I know he is telling the truth	Nkimanyi nti ayogera mazima
I don’t know, but it could happen.	Simanyi, naye kiyinza okubaawo.
I couldn’t see very clearly.	Nnali sisobola kulaba bulungi nnyo.
Or tomorrow morning.	Oba enkya ku makya.
And you can see his point.	Era osobola okulaba ensonga ye.
He can’t exist without me.	Tasobola kubeerawo nga si nze.
I know who he is.	Nze mmanyi ky’ali.
If you could talk to him that would be great.	Singa osobola okwogera naye ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
You certainly can do it.	Mazima ddala osobola okukikola.
He might be the guy.	Ayinza okuba nga ye ggaayi.
My wife told me.	Mukyala wange yang’amba nti.
Then you don’t want to be.	Awo toyagala kubeera.
I expect so much more.	Nsuubira bingi nnyo.
It wasn’t that close.	Si bwe yali kumpi nnyo.
I hoped he would come back soon	Nali nsuubira nti ajja kudda mangu
That’s what’s going to happen.	Ekyo kye kigenda okubaawo.
Nothing bad is happening.	Tewali kibi kigenda mu maaso.
I wasn’t sure it was a good idea	Nali sikakasa nti kyali kirowoozo kirungi
He knew who and what he knew.	Yali amanyi ani era kye yali amanyi.
However, I wasn’t going to do it	Kyokka nnali sigenda kukikola
I have no idea what kind of place this is	Sirina kye mmanyi nti kino kifo kya ngeri ki
He didn’t know much.	Yali tamanyi bingi.
I won’t say much about it	Sijja kwogera bingi ku nsonga eno
He didn’t know how to love.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ya kwagala.
I’m just a little bit.	Nze ndi katono ddala.
I have no idea what to do.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kukola.
To him.	Ku ye.
Lots and lots of food.	Emmere nnyingi era nnyingi.
As it is, it is.	Nga bwe kiri.
I probably won’t either	Oboolyawo nange sijja kukikola
It would be.	Kyandibadde.
Now that would be something.	Kati ekyo kyandibadde kintu.
I have my own opinion about it	Nnina endowooza yange ku nsonga eyo
I have absolutely no interest	Sirina n’akatono kye njagala
Not too long ago.	Si bbanga ddene nnyo emabega.
We are here to help!.	Tuli wano okuyamba!.
I'm going to move on.	Nze ngenda mu maaso.
The problem is that this isn’t quite right.	Obuzibu buli nti kino si kituufu nnyo.
I expected the same here.	Nali nsuubira kye kimu wano.
This is a real thing.	Kino kya ddala.
I said, maybe tomorrow	Nagamba, mpozzi enkya
I know, that’s easier said than done	Nkimanyi, ekyo kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola
I have something.	Nze nnina ekintu.
This is a very simple thing.	Kino kintu kyangu nnyo.
I wasn’t quite sure why he was doing that	Nali sikakasa bulungi lwaki yali akola ekyo
I was thinking about the car, though.	Kyokka nnali ndowooza ku mmotoka eyo.
It won’t make money.	Tekijja kukola ssente.
You don’t know either.	Naawe tomanyi.
I have something to do	Nnina kye nnina okukola
Maybe a lot.	Mpozzi bingi.
He shouldn’t be able to buy.	Talina kusobola kugula.
It’s what we are.	Kye kye tuli.
I love how easy it is	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kyangu
I needed to talk to you	Nnali nneetaaga okwogera naawe
I knew what he was doing.	Nnali mmanyi kye yali akola.
I don’t like it anymore.	Kati sikyagala.
This was a good thing.	Kino kyali kirungi.
I know we’re on the clock	Nkimanyi nti tuli ku ssaawa
Now we are moving on.	Kati tugenda mu maaso.
I guess he’s not home	Ntebereza nti tali waka
I wondered what he was doing with all this	Nneebuuza nti bino byonna yali akola ki
And who could it be.	Era ani ayinza okuba nga ye.
Maybe he'll come with his guy.	Mpozzi ajja kujja ne ggaayi we.
I knew it going into this	Nali nkimanyi nga ngenda mu kino
I should talk to him	Nze nsaanidde okwogera naye
That may have been the point.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kye kyali ensonga.
I’m going to get away from you.	Nze ngenda okuva gy’oli.
Nothing to see here.	Tewali kya kulaba wano.
I think he is the only one	Ndowooza ye yekka yekka
I didn’t care about him	Nnali sifaayo ku ye
I was thinking about my son.	Nali ndowooza ku mwana wange.
But it’s not mine.	Naye si yange.
I have three.	Nnina ssatu.
That’s where it is.	Eyo gye kiri.
I will certainly do it.	Mazima ddala nja kukikola.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
And you are the one.	Era ggwe oli.
It may be true.	Kiyinza okuba nga wa mazima.
I really just need to know	Nze ddala nneetaaga okumanya kyokka
It was time to speak up.	Kyali kiseera okwogera.
I’m not sure why.	Sikakasa lwaki.
I expect nothing from you	Tewali kye nsuubira okuva gy’oli
Here for one night only.	Wano ekiro kimu kyokka.
But this is real.	Naye kino kya ddala.
I knew he would come back	Namanya nti ajja kudda
That was my reason to do the same.	Eyo ye yali ensonga yange okukola ekintu kye kimu.
Here are some reasons why.	Wano waliwo ensonga lwaki...
I don’t think he’s a bad person	Sirowooza nti muntu kibi
I think he is more truthful actually	Ndowooza asinga kwogera mazima mu butuufu
It’s not like a city.	Si nga kibuga.
I had nothing to fear at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sirina kye ntya
I have to deal with this	Kino nnina okukola ku nsonga eno
I could have everything	Nnali nsobola okufuna buli kimu
He's a father, but you know.	Ye taata naye omanyi.
Even an hour is no problem.	Ne ssaawa emu tewali buzibu.
I hope that will be enough to go on	Nsuubira nti ekyo kijja kumala okugenda mu maaso
I didn’t know anything yet	Nze n’okutuusa kati nnali sirina kye mmanyi
That's what he wants to do.	Ekyo ky'ayagala okukola.
I think he is very good	Ndowooza mulungi nnyo
This is not the case in reality.	Kino si bwe kiri mu butuufu.
I know it and you know it.	Nze nkimanyi era naawe okimanyi.
That is a very good thing.	Ekyo kintu kirungi nnyo.
However, that was not the case.	Kyokka, ekyo si bwe kyali.
I love the guy.	Njagala nnyo ggaayi.
I was the person he wanted	Nze omuntu gwe yali ayagala
You’ll be fine here.	Ojja kuba bulungi wano.
I had lost hope.	Nnali nfunye essuubi.
I knew what they were like	Nali mmanyi bwe baali
This is problematic for any system	Kino kizibu ku nkola yonna
That’s a wonderful situation.	Eyo mbeera nnungi nnyo.
You work hard, and you do well.	Okola nnyo, era okola bulungi.
I really had no choice	Mazima ddala nnali sirina kya kukola
I knew only one of us could go	Nnali nkimanyi nti omu yekka ku ffe asobola okugenda
I didn’t know what to do with it.	Nnali simanyi kya kukikola.
I can do that at home	Ekyo nsobola okukikola awaka
No one knew that better than he did.	Ekyo tewali yali akimanyi okusinga ye.
It’s not a good idea.	Si kirowoozo kirungi.
He's here.	Ali wano.
It may be normal.	Kiyinza okuba nga kya bulijjo.
I thought you would come to my place	Nalowooza nti ojja kujja mu kifo kyange
We certainly should.	Mazima ddala tusaanidde.
I couldn’t, of course	Nnali sisobola, ddala
You don’t have to come.	Tolina kujja.
I needed to act quickly	Nnali nneetaaga okukola amangu
I needed a job and still do.	Nnali nneetaaga omulimu era n’okutuusa kati.
I want whatever you want	Njagala kyonna ky’oyagala
I wanted somewhere to go	Nnali njagala we ngenda
You are much like me.	Oli nnyo nga nze.
I want to be there.	Njagala kubeerawo.
No problems so far.	Tewali buzibu okutuusa kati.
That’s pretty easy.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo.
I don’t want to go on	Saagala kugenda mu maaso
Probably nothing.	Oboolyawo tewali kintu kyonna.
Maybe now is not a good time to talk.	Mpozzi kati si kiseera kirungi okwogera.
I'll see to my room	Nja kulaba okutuuka mu kisenge kyange
That’s what’s there.	Kye kiri awo.
I didn’t know why at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi lwaki.
This is a police matter.	Eno nsonga ya poliisi.
It was something.	Kyali kintu.
I would love to go with you	Njagala nnyo okugenda naawe
He was nervous about it.	Yali alina ekizibu ku nsonga eyo.
I had no idea anyone else was here	Nali simanyi nti waliwo omuntu omulala yenna yali wano
All of this is neither here nor there.	Bino byonna si wano wadde wali.
I want to go alone	Njagala kugenda nzekka
We can do this.	Kino tusobola okukikola.
Now he could see something, but not what.	Kati yali asobola okulaba ekintu, naye si kiki.
I didn’t really have one	Mu butuufu nnali sirina emu
Not all of it, no.	Si byonna, nedda.
I still didn’t know what he did, what he did	N’okutuusa kati nnali simanyi kye yakola, kye yakola
Not good, not bad.	Si kirungi, si kibi.
I didn’t want money	Nnali saagala ssente
I need money, and lots of it	Nneetaaga ssente, era nnyingi nnyo
I think he should come with me	Ndowooza yandibadde ajja nange
I said we needed to talk.	Nagamba nti twetaaga okwogera.
And we can’t wait.	Era tetusobola kulinda.
I am a real person.	Ndi muntu ddala.
And so he told me.	Era bw’atyo bwe yang’amba.
I didn’t know he was going to do it	Nnali simanyi nti yali agenda kukikola
But you, you wanted to.	Naye ggwe, wali oyagala.
My friend was with me	Mukwano gwange yali nange
I wanted to do the work.	Nnali njagala kukola mulimu.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
He was there.	Yali awo.
I was so close.	Nnali kumpi nnyo.
He can do anything really.	Asobola okukola ekintu kyonna ddala.
You don’t have to know.	Tolina kumanya.
I can’t tell.	Sisobola kumanya.
I knew he wouldn’t be thinking clearly at that point	Namanya nti mu kiseera ekyo tajja kuba alowooza bulungi
And yes, that is true in a sense.	Era ye, ekyo kituufu mu ngeri emu.
I know exactly where we are	Nze mmanyi bulungi gye tuli
I was more nervous than he was.	Nnali ntya nnyo okusinga ye.
However, it is true.	Kyokka, kituufu.
But that’s just the thing.	Naye ekyo kye kintu kyokka.
Better...	Okusinga...
I know he should talk to you about it.	Nkimanyi yandibadde ayogera naawe ku nsonga eyo.
It went very well.	Yagenda bulungi nnyo.
I think about everything	Ndowooza ku buli kimu
And that is the worst part.	Era ekyo kye kibi ennyo.
Maybe it is, maybe not.	Mpozzi bwe kiri, mpozzi si bwe kiri.
No one knows who it is.	Tewali amanyi ani.
I won’t be home tonight	Sijja kudda waka ekiro kino
There isn’t anything at all.	Tewali n’akatono.
I didn’t even know if it was a good thing	Nali simanyi na oba kyali kintu kirungi
But he isn’t.	Naye si bw’atyo.
He didn't know what to expect.	Yali tamanyi kye yali asuubira.
I was hoping you would come tonight	Nali nsuubira nti ojja kujja ekiro kino
Down in with himself.	Wansi mu ne ye kennyini.
I wasn’t quite sure what it was	Nnali sikakasa bulungi kiki kye kyali
I’m working hard.	Nze nkola nnyo.
You’re here, it’s there.	Oli wano, kiri awo.
That’s not us right now.	Ekyo si ffe mu kiseera kino.
I am happy to be back at work.	Ndi musanyufu okudda ku mulimu.
Not mine, anyway.	Si kyange, mu ngeri yonna.
If that was even a thing.	Singa ekyo kyali wadde ekintu.
But he didn't want money on her, though.	Naye yali tayagala ssente ku ye, wadde.
I didn’t know you were afraid	Nze nali simanyi nti otya
This is his position.	Kino kye kifo kye.
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
No one wants it here.	Tewali ayagala wano.
I wasn’t really going to do anything serious.	Mu butuufu nnali sigenda kukola kintu kyonna kya maanyi.
Of course, he has been working.	Kya lwatu nti abadde akola.
I want you to go with me	Njagala ogenda nange
I go too fast	Ngenda nnyo mu bwangu
He knew what he was doing.	Yali amanyi kye yali akola.
That, of course, is just not true.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, si kituufu kyokka.
But no one knows where they are.	Naye tewali amanyi gye bali.
happy not only me.	musanyufu si nze nzekka.
I knew what it was like	Nnali mmanyi bwe kyali
That may have been a blessing.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kyali kya mukisa.
I am going to try to do this at home	Kino ngenda kugezaako okukikola waka
You actually can.	Mu butuufu osobola.
I think he’ll be fine	Ndowooza ajja kuba bulungi
I was wondering too	Nange nnali nneebuuza
I have no idea where we are	Sirina kye mmanyi gye tuli
I can’t really comment on this	Mu butuufu sisobola kwogera ku nsonga eno
Either way, there is nothing for him to ‘do’.	Mu ngeri yonna, tewali ky’alina ‘kukola’.
Like, really, really good.	Nga, ddala, ddala kirungi.
Every day, the same thing.	Buli lunaku, ekintu kye kimu.
He has three.	Alina ssatu.
That is exactly what it is.	Ekyo ddala kye kiri.
Most immediately.	Okusinga amangu ddala.
I could hardly believe it	Nnali sisobola bulungi kukkiriza
I'll stay here.	Nja kusigala wano.
I don’t know the reason either	Nange simanyi nsonga
We just need him to do it.	Twetaaga ye yekka okukikola.
I really can’t live without it.	Mazima ddala sisobola kubeerawo nga sirina.
I really don’t want to know.	Mazima ddala saagala kumanya.
I had no way of knowing	Nnali sirina ngeri gye nnali mmanyi
It will never happen again.	Tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
I feel stronger now.	Mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi kati.
I don’t think this was a good idea.	Sirowooza nti kino kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
I want to be present in the moment	Njagala kubeerawo mu kiseera kino
Of what it is to be human	Ku kye kiri okubeera omuntu
I can’t do this alone	Kino sisobola kukikola nzekka
I think that will always stay with me	Ndowooza ekyo kijja kusigala nange bulijjo
It is not the same with us.	Si bwe kiri ne ku ffe.
Is there you who wants something.	Waliwo ggwe ayagala ekintu.
I couldn’t be around you	Nnali sisobola kubeera kumpi naawe
I wondered exactly what he was thinking	Nneebuuza ddala kye yali alowooza
I couldn’t be with anyone	Nnali sisobola kubeera na muntu yenna
I know he will want to help	Nkimanyi nti ajja kwagala okuyamba
Please don’t go.	Nsaba togenda.
But that’s not quite right.	Naye ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
But not now.	Naye si kati.
That would be much easier.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
I can easily do it here	Nze wano nsobola bulungi okukikola
I knew it was close.	Namanya nti kyali kumpi.
I know you are.	Nkimanyi nti oli.
But it was definitely time to move on	Naye mazima ddala kyali kiseera kya kugenda mu maaso
I can’t wait to talk to you	Siyinza kulinda kwogera naawe
You don’t have a bit of.	Tolina katono ku...
And I knew this wasn’t good	Era nnali nkimanyi nti kino si kirungi
I love doing it	Njagala nnyo okukikola
I was ready anyway	Nali mwetegefu mu ngeri yonna
I thought for a moment.	Nalowooza okumala akaseera.
You have to be here.	Ggwe olina okuba wano.
He said he didn’t want one.	Yagambye nti tayagala emu.
I know, but he was asleep	Nkimanyi naye yali yeebase
It was easy to do.	Kyali kyangu okukola.
I want some time alone with you	Njagala akaseera nga ndi nzekka naawe
I’ll be there soon now.	Nja kubeerawo mu bbanga ttono kati.
That was something he should have done.	Ekyo kyali kintu kye yandibadde akola.
It belongs to everyone else.	Kya buli muntu omulala yenna.
He got lucky.	Yafuna omukisa.
I won’t wait any longer	Sijja kuddamu kulinda
They are busy.	Bali bbize.
I can’t say much about it	Siyinza kwogera bingi ku nsonga eyo
The food was ready.	Emmere yali ewedde.
He probably would.	Oboolyawo yandikoze.
We can’t do anything tonight.	Tetusobola kukola kintu kyonna ekiro kino.
Something my wife likes too.	Ekintu ne mukyala wange ky’ayagala.
I won’t be a problem	Sijja kuba kizibu
I wanted to say something, anything	Nnali njagala okwogera ekintu, ekintu kyonna
I was curious too	Nange nnali njagala okumanya
That’s what he needed.	Ekyo yali yeetaaga.
I will say that again.	Ekyo nja kuddamu okwogera.
I need to talk to you	Nnina okwogera naawe
You won’t do anything.	Tojja kukola kintu kyonna.
This is not happening.	Kino si kigenda mu maaso.
I think it was important to me.	Ndowooza nti kyali kikulu gyendi.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
We’ll probably talk to you again,’ he said.	Oboolyawo tugenda kuddamu okwogera naawe,’ bwe yagambye.
Down to him.	Wansi ku ye.
Maybe that’s what it is.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kiri.
He was planning to do it.	Yali ateekateeka okukikola.
That was the problem.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
I think you just have to talk to him	Ndowooza olina kwogera naye yekka
Maybe a week.	Mpozzi wiiki emu.
He will make things happen.	Ajja kukola ebintu okubaawo.
He must be real.	Ateekwa okuba nga ddala.
I’m not the only one	Si nze nzekka
I knew from there that we would have a problem.	Namanya okuva awo nti tujja kufuna ekizibu.
He couldn't see anything or anything.	Yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna oba ekintu kyonna.
I think that’s pretty cool	Ndowooza ekyo kirungi nnyo
Not with him.	Si naye.
But we’ll see.	Naye tujja kulaba.
If we were.	Singa ffe.
It’s what anyone would do.	Kye muntu yenna kye yandikoze.
And that wasn’t the problem.	Era ekyo si kye kyali ekizibu.
I feel that he is very good.	Mpulira nti mulungi nnyo.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
No one knows anything.	Tewali amanyi kintu kyonna.
My plan was good.	Enteekateeka yange yali nnungi.
I really thought he was going to stay	Ddala nnalowooza nti yali agenda kusigala
I hope we will move forward	Nsuubira nti tujja kugenda mu maaso
Not until today.	Si okutuusa leero.
Just him and his wife.	Ye ne mukyala we yekka.
But he should have known better.	Naye yandibadde asinga okumanya.
I knew what he was doing	Nnali mmanyi kye yali akola
I know how to reach them	Nze mmanyi engeri gye nnyinza okutuuka gye bali
I need a friend, she thought	Nneetaaga mukwano gwange, bwe yalowooza
I am happy to be back at work	Ndi musanyufu okudda ku mulimu
That is the whole problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyonna.
But you never know what’s going to happen.	Naye tomanyi kigenda kubaawo.
I know how they are	Nze mmanyi bwe bali
I had no idea they were friends	Nnali simanyi nti baali ba mukwano
He started in the front.	Yatandika mu maaso.
I think that’s very important.	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo.
That might be what you want.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kye oyagala.
And that was true.	Era ekyo kyali kituufu.
And yet here it was.	Era naye wano we kyali.
I knew you weren’t going to be here long	Namanya nti togenda kubeera wano bbanga ddene
I know he knows what’s going on	Nkimanyi nti amanyi ekigenda mu maaso
I think that will have to go to someone else.	Ndowooza ekyo kijja kuba kigenda eri omuntu omulala.
I am so happy to have a friend like him	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okufuna mukwano gwange nga ye
Not everyone can do that.	Si buli muntu nti asobola okukola ekyo.
I am sick of this.	Kino ndi mulwadde.
And he says no.	Era agamba nti nedda.
It’s great to be here.	Kirungi nnyo okubeera wano.
Probably pretty good.	Oboolyawo nga nnungi nnyo.
I have no expectations	Sirina kye nsuubira
I love it here	Njagala nnyo wano
Is it for everyone? 	Kiri eri buli muntu?
I'm not even sure it's true.	Sikakasa na nti kituufu.
I didn’t want to be at school	Nnali saagala kubeera ku ssomero
He was in trouble.	Yali mu buzibu.
Very good for you.	Kirungi nnyo gyoli.
He said he just couldn't do it.	Yagambye nti yali tasobola kukikola kyokka.
I guess he’s fine.	Ntebereza nti ali bulungi.
That would have been a long time ago.	Ekyo kyandibadde dda nnyo emabega.
We can.	Tusobola.
You are like me.	Ggwe oli nga nze.
I will stay here with him	Nja kusigala wano naye
Not everyone wants to.	Si buli muntu nti ayagala.
He said that.	Yagambye nti.
I have to find someone	Nnina okufuna omuntu
He won't.	Tajja.
I know you know how it is	Nkimanyi nti omanyi bwe kiri
You can go.	Osobola okugenda.
He will be there.	Ajja kubeerawo.
But nothing comes.	Naye tewali kijja.
I suppose he must have had some interest in the place	Nsuubira nti ateekwa okuba nga yalina ky’ayagala ku kifo ekyo
He says it’s best to go now.	Agamba nti kirungi okugenda kati.
I wonder who it could be	Nneebuuza ani ayinza okuba
You are so powerful.	Oli wa maanyi nnyo.
I knew what he was capable of	Nnali mmanyi kye yali asobola okukola
That seems to have been the case here.	Ekyo kirabika kye kyali wano.
I have to talk to him	Nnina okwogera naye
And it’s okay to win.	Era si kibi okuwangula.
I don’t know what to do	Simanyi kya kukola
I guess that’s a good thing.	Ntebereza nti ekyo kintu kirungi.
You are my everything.	Ggwe buli kimu kyange.
No one worked as hard as he did.	Tewali yakola nnyo nga ye.
Me and you.	Nze naawe.
I couldn’t even go to school	Nnali sisobola na kugenda ku ssomero
He is a very nice man.	Ye musajja omulungi ennyo.
I will never do it again	Sijja kuddamu kukikola
Sorry.	Nsonyiwa.
I was still unemployed	N’okutuusa kati nnali sirina mulimu
That's basically what it is.	Ekyo okusinga kye kiri.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Kya lwatu nti kino si bwe kiri.
But maybe that was the point.	Naye osanga eyo ye yali ensonga.
Both are in the same system.	Bombi bali mu nkola emu.
I didn’t know for what reason	Nze nali simanyi lwa nsonga ki
It can be helpful.	Kiyinza okuyamba.
I don’t want to be that man	Nze saagala kubeera musajja oyo
I didn’t know something like that would happen	Nnali simanyi kintu ng’ekyo kijja kubaawo
I have to get back to work.	Nnina okudda ku mulimu.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
I didn’t even know for sure	Nnali simanyi na mazima
No one wants that.	Ekyo tewali ayagala.
I hoped he wouldn’t do that	Nnali nsuubira nti ekyo tajja kukikola
I like things a certain way	Njagala ebintu mu ngeri emu
It's all me.	Byonna nze.
Really for me.	Ddala ku nze.
I knew it was very important	Nali mmanyi nti kikulu nnyo
I wonder why he was here	Nze nneebuuza lwaki yali wano
I was a very good teacher.	Nnali musomesa mulungi nnyo.
I was three hours early	Nnali ssaawa ssatu nga bukyali
And you know we need to.	Era okimanyi nti twetaaga.
That’s what’s important.	Ekyo kye kikulu.
In fact, it could be anyone down there.	Mu butuufu, kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna wansi awo.
I hope he is telling the truth	Nsuubira nti ayogera mazima
But he had it in him.	Naye yalina mu ye.
But still it was fine.	Naye nga bwe kiri kyali kirungi.
I really, really do.	Nze ddala, ddala nkola.
Everyone was here.	Buli omu yali wano.
I really don’t want to go	Mazima ddala saagala kugenda
I thought you were.	Nnalowooza nti ggwe oli.
I couldn’t find much about it.	Nnali sisobola kufuna bingi ku nsonga eyo.
No problems so far.	Tewali buzibu okutuusa kati.
Money, money, money.	Ssente, ssente, ssente.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
I didn’t know from what	Nali simanyi okuva ku kiki
He knows this.	Kino akimanyi.
He did it very, very well.	Yakikola bulungi nnyo nnyo.
But we have work to do.	Naye tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
I have to say he was a very good singer	Nnina okugamba nti yali muyimbi mulungi nnyo
In this way, in this way.	Mu ngeri eno, mu ngeri eno.
And that’s what it is.	Era ekyo kye kiri.
You want to.	Ggwe oyagala.
I wanted someone else to work with him	Nnali njagala omuntu omulala akole naye
And he probably was.	Era oboolyawo bwe yali.
That is my problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyange.
Maybe he could.	Mpozzi yali asobola.
In a way, he really is there.	Mu ngeri emu, ddala ali awo.
But not like me.	Naye si nga nze.
To be, he is here.	Okubeera, ali wano.
Not good, not bad.	Si kirungi, si kibi.
This is what you really want for you.	Kino ky’oyagala ennyo gy’oli.
Everything will be fine.	Buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi.
He must go home now.	Ateekwa okudda eka kati.
' ME !.	' NZE !.
No response so far.	Tewali kuddamu okutuusa kati.
The whole book.	Ekitabo kyonna.
Dogs, of course.	Embwa, ddala.
I thought that would be great	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo
I knew you were okay	Nali mmanyi nti oli bulungi
I didn’t even have a job	Nnali sirina wadde omulimu
I'm not sure what's going on.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
I could hear behind me	Nnali mpulira emabega wange
This seems to be the case.	Kino kirabika bwe kiri.
I was a little nervous	Nali ntya katono
He had to be, he thought.	Yalina okuba, bwe yalowooza.
I thought of his wife	Nalowooza ku mukyala we
We can do it.	Tusobola okukikola.
I have no idea where	Sirina kye mmanyi wa
I wondered who I was supposed to be	Nneebuuza nti ani gwe nnina okubeera
I was just a little lucky	Nali wa mukisa katono ddala
I guess he needs some time	Ntebereza nti yeetaaga akaseera
Not much, but home.	Si bingi, naye awaka.
in fact now i am really happy!!.	mu butuufu kati ndi musanyufu ddala!!.
And he should have.	Era yandibadde alina.
I really need to know	Nze ddala nneetaaga okumanya
Now, none of this will be easy.	Kati, tewali na kimu ku bino kijja kuba kyangu.
Why do you .	Lwaki okola .
I think this is a completely normal process	Ndowooza eno nkola ya bulijjo ddala
I want you, you want me	Njagala ggwe, ggwe oyagala nze
Better.	Okusinga.
He and that brother.	Ye ne muganda we oyo.
He wants to do it.	Ayagala okukikola.
No man lives here.	Tewali musajja abeera wano.
I didn’t know how to proceed.	Nali simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso.
I don’t know what it is, really.	Simanyi kye kiri, ddala.
He knew he wasn't thinking clearly.	Yali akimanyi nti talowooza bulungi.
We’ll have dinner.	Tujja kulya ekyeggulo.
I know you have to do this yourself	Nkimanyi nti kino olina okukikola wekka
You have to go back to school with us.	Olina okudda naffe ku ssomero.
I couldn’t believe this was actually happening	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti ddala kino kyali kigenda mu maaso
It seems you are a dangerous man to know.	Kirabika oli musajja wa bulabe okumanya.
I know there’s a guy	Nkimanyi nti waliwo ggaayi
It’s certainly nothing of the sort.	Mazima ddala si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
And that was the way it had to be.	Era eyo ye yali engeri gye kyalina okuba.
In so many cases, you have to do the work.	Mu mbeera nnyingi nnyo, olina okukola omulimu.
I, however, had no choice	Kyokka nze nnali sirina kya kukola
You can’t tell if it’s a friend.	Tosobola kumanya oba mukwano.
I didn’t think it was him.	Nze nali sirowooza nti ye ye.
Almost anything will do.	Kumpi ekintu kyonna kijja kukola.
I thought you were my friend too	Nalowooza nti naawe oli mukwano gwange
That's the opinion.	Eyo ndowooza.
I have the same problem	Nze nnina ekizibu kye kimu
Maybe, maybe not.	Mpozzi, mpozzi nedda.
And of course, that.	Era ddala, ekyo.
No one needed to know.	Tewali yali yeetaaga kumanya.
I didn’t know how long	Nnali simanyi bbanga ki
I was so in love with it	Nnali njagala nnyo
You can’t see anything.	Tosobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
It may be, he said.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri, bwe yagambye.
But he had it too.	Naye naye yalina.
Someone we can live with	Omuntu gwe tusobola okubeera naye
Until he fell asleep.	Okutuusa lwe yeebase.
I can see everybody, you know	Nsobola okulaba buli muntu, omanyi
I didn’t know at all	Nnali simanyi n’akatono
I needed a moment to think	Nnali nneetaaga akaseera katono okulowooza
And he loves his job	Era ayagala nnyo omulimu gwe
I didn’t know he could do such a thing.	Nnali simanyi nti asobola okukola ekintu ng’ekyo.
I hope that’s a good thing	Nsuubira nti ekyo kintu kirungi
I don’t know what that was	Ekyo simanyi kye kyali
He's still there.	Akyali awo.
I knew it wouldn’t work	Namanya nti tekijja kukola
I don’t have time for that.	Ekyo sirina budde.
And that’s what we’re going to do today.	Era ekyo kye tugenda okukola leero.
And, in fact, this is it.	Era, mu butuufu, kino kye kiri.
Perhaps that was it.	Oboolyawo ekyo kye kyali.
Now we’ll do something you want to do.	Kati tujja kukola ekintu ky’oyagala okukola.
I hoped they were both okay	Nali nsuubira nti bombi baali bulungi
I can’t be good.	Sisobola kuba mulungi.
But everything is fine.	Naye buli kimu kiri bulungi.
I couldn’t be happier, really	Siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo, ddala
I’m not the only one saying this.	Si nze nzekka okwogera bino.
That’s what’s important.	Ekyo kye kikulu.
Nothing unusual about that.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo ku ekyo.
I'm on this issue.	Nze ku nsonga eno.
It was actually quite good.	Mu butuufu kyali kirungi nnyo.
We have no idea what’s going on.	Tetulina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
I want to talk to him, face to face	Njagala kwogera naye, maaso ku maaso
To my wife.	Eri mukyala wange.
I was just wondering	Nze nnali nneebuuza kyokka
But very, very quickly.	Naye mangu nnyo nnyo.
I couldn’t stay there	Nnali sisobola kusigala awo
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
We have to do it now.	Tulina okukikola kati.
I said you were with him	Nagamba nti wali naye
I am now very happy	Nze kati ndi musanyufu nnyo
I was afraid too	Nange nnali ntya
I didn’t know how to deal with the situation	Nnali simanyi ngeri ya kukola ku mbeera eyo
He is certainly afraid.	Mazima ddala atya.
On his part.	Ku ludda lwe.
That was you.	Oyo gwe wali ggwe.
I was pretty sure that would be fine	Nali nkakasa bulungi nti ekyo kyandibadde kirungi
That’s what he said, too.	Ekyo naye kye yayogera.
I guess you can.	Ntebereza nti oyinza.
It is because of his opinion.	Kiri lwa ndowooza ye.
Effort.	Amaanyi.
Or perhaps it would.	Oba oboolyawo kyandibadde.
I guess we’ll have to see.	Ntebereza nti tujja kuba tulina okulaba.
Maybe just something.	Mpozzi ekintu kyokka.
I used to be a father	Nze nnali mbeera taata
I have no idea who it is	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku ani
He will, of course.	Ajja kukikola, ddala.
However, it is not my thing.	Kyokka si kintu kyange.
In good condition.	Mu mbeera nnungi.
Every.	Buli.
I couldn’t see who it was	Nnali sisobola kulaba ani
I have to think.	Nnina okulowooza.
I didn’t know what to expect	Nnali simanyi kye nnali nsuubira
I don't care which way.	Sifaayo ngeri ki.
Not in time.	Si mu budde.
He wanted to do that himself.	Ekyo yali ayagala kukikola ye kennyini.
That’s the problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu.
I didn’t know he had	Nali simanyi nti alina
He had plenty of time.	Yalina obudde bungi.
I couldn’t talk to him	Nali sisobola kwogera naye
However, that may just be me.	Kyokka, ekyo kiyinza okuba nga nze nzekka.
I thought it would be nice.	Nalowooza nti kyandibadde kirungi.
I was just a kid at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali mwana muto yekka
I couldn’t tell which	Nnali sisobola kumanya ki
I couldn’t eat.	Nnali sisobola kulya.
You know me.	Omanyi nze.
I need to make a phone call	Nze nneetaaga okukuba essimu
Everyone is there.	Buli muntu ali awo.
I knew he had a lot.	Namanya nti yalina bingi.
He didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala.
The night alone is not bad	Ekiro kyokka si kibi
I couldn’t believe how strong he was	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza ngeri gye yali wa maanyi
Very nice car.	Mmotoka nnungi nnyo.
I need to be with myself	Nze nneetaaga okubeera nange kennyini
How can I do this? 	Kino nsobola okukikola ntya?
I am not a threat to you or you	Siri wa bulabe gy’oli oba ggwe
I wish it wasn’t	Njagala nga si bwe kiri
But this is long term.	Naye kino kya bbanga ddene.
In fact, it was a lovely idea.	Mu butuufu, kyali kirowoozo kya kwagala nnyo.
I'm afraid.	Ntya.
He wasn’t going to do it again.	Yali tagenda kuddamu kukikola.
He started very young.	Yatandika nga muto nnyo.
But it really isn’t.	Naye ddala si bwe kiri.
I think we’ll be fine	Ndowooza tujja kuba bulungi
But he didn't quite know what that was.	Naye yali tamanyi bulungi ekyo kye kyali.
Maybe it’s nothing.	Mpozzi si kintu kyonna.
And well you don’t have to.	Era bulungi tolina.
I can work anytime	Nsobola okukola essaawa yonna
We can do the same here.	Naffe tusobola okukola kye kimu wano.
We are among friends here.	Tuli mu mikwano wano.
I wasn’t ready to know	Nnali siri mwetegefu kumanya
I couldn’t win.	Nnali sisobola kuwangula.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
I guess that would be you	Ntebereza nti oyo yandibadde ggwe
I’m working now.	Nze nkola kati.
I think it’s very important.	Ndowooza kikulu nnyo.
More than anything, he wanted to help .	Okusinga ekintu kyonna, yali ayagala okuyamba .
I don’t want to do these things	Ebintu bino saagala kukola
Maybe no one knew who he was.	Mpozzi nga tewali yali amanyi ani.
I was working in an office at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali nkola mu ofiisi
But no one knows it.	Naye tewali akimanyi.
I love it in almost everything.	Njagala nnyo kumpi mu buli kimu.
I am always happy	Bulijjo nze ndi musanyufu
Being really human is what matters.	Okubeera omuntu ddala kye kikulu.
Obviously not with him.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri ku ye.
I was young, and I needed a job	Nnali muto, era nga nneetaaga omulimu
He knew it all too well.	Yali akimanyi bulungi nnyo.
Good, good, good.	Kirungi, kirungi, kirungi.
This is going to happen.	Kino kigenda mu maaso.
No, he saw it.	Nedda, yalaba.
I don’t know why, since it was a good answer.	Simanyi lwaki, okuva bwe kiri nti kyali kya kuddamu kirungi.
This is certainly true.	Kino mazima ddala kituufu.
Probably it wasn’t.	Oboolyawo si bwe kyali.
I love being with you	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe
I can’t do this either	Kino nange sisobola kukikola
But this doesn’t seem to be the case.	Naye kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
A lot like you in so many ways	Bingi nga ggwe mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo
You have to see someone.	Olina okulaba omuntu.
I don’t know what he said	Simanyi kye yayogera
I thought he was right behind me	Nalowooza nti yali emabega wange ddala
I'm glad you're on time.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli mu budde.
No one told me.	Tewali yangamba.
It’s very hard to see.	Kizibu nnyo okulaba.
I can’t see his point	Sisobola kulaba nsonga ye
Hours per day.	Ssaawa buli lunaku.
He may have felt the same way.	Ayinza okuba nga naye yawulira bw’atyo.
I'm going to go here.	Nze ngenda wano.
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
It was an easy thing to do.	Kyali kintu kyangu okukola.
It was a car.	Yali mmotoka.
Someone is doing it.	Waliwo akikola.
I guess, this is good for them.	Ntebereza, kino kirungi gye bali.
But he was my friend.	Naye yali mukwano gwange.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
He made one.	Yakola emu.
I thought everything would be fine	Nalowooza nti buli kimu kijja kuba kirungi
I thought, nothing really	Nalowooza, tewali kintu kyonna ddala
He is at work.	Ali ku mulimu.
I knew you were you, you were you	Namanya nti ggwe ggwe, ggwe ggwe
I wonder why he does this	Nze nneebuuza lwaki akola kino
I didn’t know you were going to do this now	Kino nali simanyi nti kati ogenda kukikola
This will continue to be the case.	Kino kijja kusigala nga bwe kiri.
He knew he must be very strong.	Yali akimanyi nti ateekwa okuba nga wa maanyi nnyo.
We can't.	Tetusobola.
I do like you a lot	Nze nkola nga ggwe nnyo
I know you know that though	Nkimanyi nti ekyo okimanyi wadde
I want to do this but not have the money	Njagala kukola kino naye si kuba na ssente
You won’t be anywhere.	Tojja kuba wa.
If only it were good.	Singa kyali kirungi.
And this is actually true.	Era kino mu butuufu kituufu.
Only I can do this.	Nze nzekka asobola okukola kino.
It won’t be the same tomorrow.	Tekijja kuba kye kimu enkya.
This concept is here.	Endowooza eno eri wano.
He didn’t need to do that.	Yali teyeetaaga kukola ekyo.
He wanted to make a lot of money.	Yali ayagala kukola ssente nnyingi.
It’s just a moment.	Akaseera katono ddala.
I know nothing about it	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo
I think this is a good idea.	Ndowooza kino kirowoozo kirungi.
My best friend.	Mukwano gwange asinga.
In fact, he seems less friendly now.	Mu butuufu, kati alabika talina mukwano nnyo.
I can get home alone	Nsobola okutuuka awaka nzekka
We just have to move forward.	Tulina kumala kugenda mu maaso.
I really hope he gets his own movie soon	Nsuubira ddala nti mu bbanga ttono ajja kufuna firimu ye
He is very human.	Ye muntu nnyo.
It could have been anyone.	Kyandibadde omuntu yenna.
I hope no one wants to	Nsuubira tewali ayagala
This is a beautiful place.	Kino kifo kirungi nnyo.
It's a movie.	Ye firimu.
Not very good at that.	Si mulungi nnyo ku ekyo.
He didn’t want this to happen.	Kino yali tayagala kubaawo.
I don’t want to wait either.	Nze nange saagala kulinda.
He knows that very well.	Ekyo akimanyi nnyo.
Very nice to see.	Kirungi nnyo okulaba.
I was wondering if you would be interested	Nali nneebuuza oba wandyagadde
And he was very popular too.	Era naye yali muganzi nnyo.
This is very close.	Kino kiri kumpi nnyo.
I thought it was him	Nalowooza nti ye ye
Everything is together.	Buli kimu kiri wamu.
Where to go.	Wa okugenda.
I’m sure he’s fine	Nkakasa nti ali bulungi
I was so beautiful	Nnali mulungi nnyo
For a moment he looked good.	Okumala akaseera katono yali alabika bulungi.
I’m sure it’s nothing	Nkakasa nti si kintu kyonna
I’m in the office.	Nze ndi mu ofiisi.
He can go tonight.	Asobola okugenda ekiro kino.
He was powerless, and he didn’t know what to do.	Yali talina maanyi, era yali tamanyi kya kukola.
I’m sure we will.	Nkakasa nti tujja kukikola.
I love it in the morning.	Njagala nnyo ku makya.
I really have no idea.	Mazima ddala sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
I knew it could only be one thing	Namanya nti kiyinza okuba ekintu kimu kyokka
I was working very, very hard	Nali nkola nnyo nnyo
It’s good that you’re interested though.	Kirungi nti oyagala wadde.
' to '.	' ku '.
I’m not entirely sure.	Sikakasa ddala.
I really needed a plan	Nnali nneetaaga nnyo enteekateeka
I really need a job	Nze nneetaaga nnyo omulimu
I don’t want to be his wife	Saagala kubeera mukyala we
In your own way.	Mu ngeri yo.
He said no one was home.	Yagambye nti awaka tewali muntu yenna.
I was completely alone	Nali nzekka ddala
But not too close.	Naye si kumpi nnyo.
I just want a simple room	Njagala kisenge kyangu kyokka
Or anyone else for that matter.	Oba omuntu omulala yenna ku nsonga eyo.
That was the problem, obviously.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu, kya lwatu.
I do now, anyway	Nkola kati, mu ngeri yonna
No, he is not happy.	Nedda, si musanyufu.
Here, we’re going to talk about that.	Wano, ekyo tugenda kwogera.
I was so nervous this morning	Nali ntya nnyo enkya ya leero
I love you too.	Naawe njagala nnyo.
But he did it anyway.	Naye yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
I will do as he asked	Nja kukola nga bwe yasaba
I think he's going really well	Ndowooza agenda mu maaso ddala
And no one went.	Era tewali yagenda.
Every child has their own book.	Buli mwana alina ekitabo kye.
I know that very well	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi nnyo
I don’t think that really matters.	Sirowooza nti ekyo kikulu nnyo.
I love being with you	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe
I don’t know what it was like	Simanyi bwe kyali
His house is typical in many ways.	Ennyumba ye ya bulijjo mu ngeri nnyingi.
Nothing was going to happen.	Tewali kyali kigenda kubaawo.
I’m not going back to prison	Sigenda kudda mu kkomera
We probably both are.	Oboolyawo ffembi bwe tuli.
I just loved working with him	Nze nnali njagala nnyo okukola naye
This was not the case.	Kino si bwe kyali.
Someone else will do it.	Omuntu omulala ajja kukikola.
I knew he was sick and needed help	Nnali nkimanyi nti mulwadde era nga yeetaaga obuyambi
But it’s not a policy.	Naye si nkola.
I have an appointment and we will be there	Nnina essaawa era tujja kubeerawo
I need to do this myself	Kino nneetaaga okukikola nze kennyini
I really can’t say much more than that	Mazima ddala sisobola kwogera bingi okusinga ekyo
I just want to be alone for a little while	Njagala kubeera nzekka okumala akaseera katono
And you don’t want to do that.	Era ekyo toyagala kukikola.
I wasn’t sure and I didn’t really care	Nali sikakasa era nga sifaayo nnyo
There is no problem there.	Tewali buzibu awo.
There is no reason for him to know.	Tewali nsonga lwaki alina kumanya.
He was a good kid.	Yali mwana mulungi.
I know so many things	Nze mmanyi ebintu bingi nnyo
Getting to you work.	Okutuuka ku ggwe omulimu.
I can’t wait to see what happens	Siyinza kulinda kulaba kigenda mu maaso
I think he has a point.	Ndowooza alina ensonga.
This is beneath him.	Kino kiri wansi we.
I have to leave right now	Nnina okugenda okuva mu kiseera kino
For us it will be costly.	Ffe kijja kuba kya ssente nnyingi.
That’s going to be true.	Ekyo kigenda kuba kituufu.
However, he did nothing.	Kyokka, tewali kye yakola.
He said you are beautiful too.	Yagamba nti naawe oli mulungi.
I always have to work	Bulijjo nnina okukola
I want to know what he wants	Njagala kumanya ky’ayagala
This is definitely one of those.	Mazima ddala kino kye kimu ku ebyo.
I will probably come back to this one again.	Oboolyawo nja kuddamu okudda ku eno.
I’m sorry, but it’s happening.	Nsonyiwa naye kigenda mu maaso.
I almost wanted to	Katono nnali njagala
However, I was glad he did	Kyokka nnali musanyufu nti yakikola
I feel a lot now	Mpulira bingi kati
I think he has a point.	Ndowooza alina ensonga.
I only have my father	Nze nnina taata wange yekka
I wonder how it is in practice	Nze nneebuuza bwe kiri mu nkola
I’m on the floor.	Nze ndi wansi.
They were there in the air.	Baali awo mu bbanga.
Or no speech.	Oba tewali kwogera.
I hoped it would work out	Nnali nsuubira nti kijja kukola bulungi
I love it more than anything	Njagala nnyo okusinga ekintu kyonna
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
I thought you were my friend	Nalowooza nti oli mukwano gwange
And he does it well.	Era akikola bulungi.
You don’t know if it’s true or not.	Tomanyi oba kituufu oba nedda.
I think he can get here	Ndowooza asobola okutuuka wano
But he likely won’t.	Naye kirabika tajja kukikola.
He was a better person than she was.	Yali muntu mulungi okusinga ye.
He is a very good teacher.	Musomesa mulungi nnyo.
I just work hard.	Nze nkola nnyo kyokka.
You’re there.	Ggwe oli awo.
I couldn’t do that	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola
Anything could be down there.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okuba wansi awo.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
Now, it’s really simple.	Kati, kyangu ddala.
And that's 'true.	Era ekyo 'kituufu.
I’m too young.	Nze ndi muto nnyo.
And another one, too, now.	Era omulala, naye, kati.
I was wondering about him today	Nali nneebuuza ku ye leero
That was the bottom line.	Ekyo kye kyali wansi.
I can do anything here	Nsobola okukola ekintu kyonna wano
I wanted to have time with you alone	Nnali njagala okufuna obudde naawe wekka
He is right behind me.	Ali emabega wange ddala.
And there he was.	Era awo we yali.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
I think you should go now	Ndowooza wandibadde ogenda kati
But it had to be him.	Naye kyalina okuba nga ye.
No, it’s not true.	Nedda, si kituufu.
It’s bad for us.	Kibi gye tuli.
Mostly his best friend.	Okusinga mukwano gwe asinga.
in.	mu.
My dad is my best friend.	Taata wange mukwano gwange asinga.
This is my son.	Kino mwana wange.
He always said that.	Bulijjo yayogera bw’atyo.
You want to see everything.	Oyagala kulaba buli kimu.
I can't answer.	Sisobola kuddamu.
It’s good for you.	Kirungi gyoli.
That would be very difficult now.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo kati.
It is not easy to find a job.	Si kyangu kufuna mulimu.
What he would do in my place.	Kye yandikoze mu kifo kyange.
It is what they are.	Kye kye bali.
Together or not.	Wamu oba nedda.
I didn’t want to love anyone	Nnali saagala kwagala muntu yenna
I wish he wouldn’t	Njagala tajja kukikola
This is not quite true.	Kino si kituufu nnyo.
And that would be about me.	Era ekyo kyandibadde ku nze.
Does anyone want to go?.	Waliwo ayagala okugenda?.
He was going to do it.	Yali agenda kukikola.
You’re either in.	Ggwe oba oli mu.
I knew about it.	Nali mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
He tried another one.	Yagezaako omulala.
I really do like him	Nze ddala nkola nga ye
Indeed, we can.	Ddala, tusobola.
He is where he was, and where he should be, too.	Ye gye yali, era gye yandibadde, naye.
He tried to move on.	Yagezaako okugenda mu maaso.
I think they’re on to me	Ndowooza bali ku nze
His wife knew it too.	Mukyala we naye yali akimanyi.
He is what he is and he is.	Ye ky’ali era ye ky’ali.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
It doesn’t matter to you.	Si kikulu gy’oli.
I knew you were down here.	Namanya nti oli wansi wano.
I think he should have done that.	Ndowooza ekyo yandibadde akikola.
I won’t ride with him	Sijja kuvuga naye
No matter, it was fine.	Si nsonga, kyali kirungi.
Almost no one has.	Kumpi tewali muntu yenna alina.
But he was a doctor.	Naye yali musawo.
That, of course, is the point.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, y’ensonga.
I love dogs, always have	Njagala nnyo embwa, bulijjo nnina
I knew it was going to be my place.	Namanya nti kyali kigenda kubeera kifo kyange.
I have been very lucky	Mbadde wa mukisa nnyo
Now he knew that would never happen.	Kati yali akimanyi nti ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
I knew he would be there	Nali mmanyi nti ajja kubeerawo
But not in a good way.	Naye si mu ngeri nnungi.
I am happy to have you.	Ndi musanyufu okuba naawe.
He said he couldn’t believe it.	Yagamba nti yali tayinza kukkiriza.
He is a very nice man.	Musajja mulungi nnyo.
I am happy even today	Ndi musanyufu ne leero
I know, there’s a lot.	Nkimanyi, waliwo bingi.
He didn’t really want to do that.	Ekyo yali tayagala nnyo kukikola.
I was hoping you knew it wasn’t me	Nali nsuubira nti okimanyi nti si nze
He thought quickly.	Yalowooza mangu.
That would be terrible.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
He had a reason.	Yalina ensonga.
I’m working hard on this thing	Nkola nnyo ku kintu kino
This is love.	Kino kye kwagala.
And then it’s great.	Era awo kirungi nnyo.
It’s a common thing.	Kintu kya bulijjo.
I always have a lot of things to do.	Bulijjo nnina ebintu bingi bye nkola.
The whole issue is costly.	Ensonga yonna ya ssente nnyingi.
It looks good to me.	Kirabika bulungi gyendi.
However, nothing was going anywhere.	Kyokka, tewali kyali kigenda yonna.
I won’t do that here.	Ekyo sijja kukikola wano.
That 's what here.	Ekyo 'ki wano.
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
I didn’t know where to go from there.	Nnali simanyi gye nnyinza kugenda okuva awo.
I'm not even sure how.	Sikakasa na ngeri ki.
You are very happy.	Oli musanyufu nnyo.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
I can’t see that there’s a problem	Sisobola kulaba nti waliwo obuzibu
I have experienced something like that myself	Nze kennyini nfunye ekintu ng’ekyo
I think that’s where he went	Ndowooza awo gye yagenda
But he would have to go.	Naye yandibadde alina okugenda.
Who knew how long.	Ani yali amanyi bbanga ki.
To...	Ku...
But that is not really the case.	Naye mu butuufu ekyo si bwe kiri.
And that’s very much the case.	Era ekyo bwe kiri nnyo.
You don’t know why.	Tomanyi lwaki.
He does not need to have been at work at the time.	Teyeetaaga kuba nga yali ku mulimu mu kiseera ekyo.
I think he did it.	Ndowooza yakikola.
Everybody is everybody.	Buli muntu ye buli muntu.
I didn’t know much about cars	Mmotoka nnali simanyi nnyo
That nothing was going to happen.	Nti tewali kyali kigenda kubaawo.
It’s nothing more complicated than that.	Si kintu kizibu okusinga ekyo.
I need to know if he is still here	Nnina okumanya oba akyali wano
That’s not the point.	Eyo si y’ensonga.
Not anyone.	Si muntu yenna.
A little while.	Akaseera katono.
I know you’ll be good	Nkimanyi nti ojja kuba mulungi
He seems to be in pretty good shape.	Kirabika ali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
I think it would be me	Ndowooza nti yandibadde nze
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
My son I knew.	Mwana wange nnali mmanyi.
Not like him.	Si nga ye.
Nothing worse than this.	Tewali kibi okusinga kino.
Not everyone, no.	Si buli muntu, nedda.
I wanted to see everything.	Nnali njagala nnyo okulaba buli kimu.
We probably will.	Oboolyawo tujja kukikola.
Everything seems normal.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
But you know.	Naye omanyi.
Maybe this will be good.	Mpozzi kino kijja kuba kirungi.
That would be something.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu.
But he wasn’t well.	Naye yali talina bulungi.
I think you can go now	Ndowooza osobola okugenda kati
I was so happy to be back here.	Nali musanyufu nnyo okudda wano.
And it was everywhere.	Era kyali buli wamu.
I thought of one thing	Nnalowooza ku kintu kimu
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
He needed to drive home.	Yali yeetaaga okuvuga mmotoka okudda eka.
This was very dangerous.	Kino kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
He knew he would be coming.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kuba ajja.
He is really really sick.	Ddala ddala mulwadde.
He is a very nice person.	Ye muntu mulungi nnyo.
The whole thing is no good.	Ekintu kyonna tewali kirungi.
We’re going to do it down here.	Tugenda kukikola wansi wano.
I was hoping to be alone again	Nali nsuubira kuddamu kubeera nzekka
You have no idea.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna.
That’s very hard to know now.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo okumanya kati.
I said it didn’t matter	Nagamba nti si kikulu
I was a young child	Nnali mwana muto
I couldn’t see very clearly	Nnali sisobola kulaba bulungi nnyo
I think this picture will work well	Ndowooza ekifaananyi kino kijja kukola bulungi
He was the one.	Ye yali ye.
I wanted to help right now	Nnali njagala okuyamba mu kiseera kino
I don’t have any children.	Sirina mwana yenna.
Not this suddenly.	Si kino mu bwangu.
It’s not just for me.	Si gyendi nzekka.
This is very easy to do.	Kino kyangu nnyo okukola.
He loves to talk.	Ayagala nnyo okwogera.
Maybe not everything.	Mpozzi si buli kimu.
I hope it was good	Nsuubira nti yali nnungi
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
I know you can do the job	Nkimanyi nti osobola okukola omulimu
I was always ready	Bulijjo nnali mwetegefu
No one had it.	Tewali muntu yenna yalina.
I wonder how he felt.	Nze nneebuuza bwe yawulira.
We have to go home.	Tulina okudda eka.
I am a real friend	Ndi mukwano gwange ddala ddala
That’s what he wanted.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala.
I’m sure it was	Nkakasa nti bwe kyali
The food is good.	Emmere eri bulungi.
And this is a problem.	Era kino kizibu.
I knew he needed help	Nnali nkimanyi nti yeetaaga obuyambi
Today I have nothing to do	Leero sirina kye nkola
But he had a problem.	Naye yalina ekizibu.
A long time.	Ebbanga ddene.
This is your point.	Eno y’ensonga yo.
I should have done it already.	Nnali nsaanidde okukikola dda.
We go into that fact.	Tugenda mu nsonga eyo.
We just aren’t.	Ffe si bwe tuli kyokka.
In a sense he had.	Mu ngeri emu gye yalina.
That is why we are here.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
I couldn’t tell who it was	Nnali sisobola kumanya ani
It was time to do it again.	Kyali kiseera okuddamu okukikola.
I am so glad you are here.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti oli wano.
I didn’t need anything	Nnali sirina kye nneetaaga
That’s perfectly fine.	Ekyo kiri bulungi ddala.
You know how they are now.	Omanyi bwe bali kati.
I don't know how.	Simanyi ngeri ki.
Nothing is quite as it seems.	Tewali kintu kyonna kiri ddala nga bwe kirabika.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
Nothing can be possible.	Tewali kiyinza kusobola.
I doubt it would be	Nbuusabuusa nti kyandibadde
I knew it would work, of course	Nali mmanyi nti yandikoze, ddala
You know, you know.	Omanyi, omanyi.
And he has to go.	Era alina okugenda.
Well? 	Bulungi?
One by one, you said.	Omu ku omu, bwe wagamba.
Everything and everyone is important.	Buli kimu na buli muntu kikulu.
It would be.	Kyandibadde.
I wasn’t sure of anything	Nnali sikakasa kintu kyonna
I knew it and was willing to help	Nnali nkimanyi era nnali mwetegefu okuyamba
I'm going to the room.	Nze ngenda mu kisenge.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
It is definitely a job.	Mazima ddala mulimu.
It doesn’t really matter if it’s true or not.	Si kikulu nnyo oba kituufu oba nedda.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Mpozzi, mpozzi, mpozzi.
The opinion was mine	Endowooza yali yange
You.	Ggwe.
I don’t want to stay here	Saagala kusigala wano
He had no choice in the matter.	Yali talina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo.
I loved it so much	Nnali njagala nnyo nnyo
But when he did, he was all in.	Naye bwe yakikola, yali mu byonna.
I will buy one again	Nja kuddamu okugula emu
I hadn’t got anything	Nze nali sirina kye nfunye
He didn’t even want to be her friend.	Yali tayagala na kuba mukwano gwe.
Indeed, why not.	Mazima ddala, lwaki nedda.
In his case, very quickly.	Mu mbeera ye, mu bwangu nnyo.
I just hoped it would work	Nali nsuubira kyokka nti kijja kukola
I don’t want to talk right now.	Saagala kwogera mu kiseera kino.
I had no choice about this	Kino nnali sirina kye nnyinza kukola
I don’t know what to say.	Simanyi kya kwogera.
We have a lot of things to do.	Tulina ebintu bingi bye tulina okukola.
I’m a young child.	Nze ndi mwana muto.
Maybe everything, he thought.	Mpozzi buli kimu, bwe yalowooza.
No, he said.	Nedda, bwe yagamba.
No one knows the right answer.	Tewali amanyi kya kuddamu kituufu.
I couldn’t believe he was actually mine	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti mu butuufu yali wange
We are here to help!.	Tuli wano okuyamba!.
I can do almost anything here	Nsobola okukola kumpi ekintu kyonna wano
And what a beautiful phone.	Era nga essimu nnungi nnyo.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
You know he’s not.	Omanyi si bw’atyo.
A day in the sky.	Olunaku mu bbanga.
It would be nice to do that.	Kyandibadde kirungi okukola ekyo.
He said we would have a week together.	Yagambye nti tujja kuba ne wiiki emu nga tuli wamu.
I think he is a lovely guy.	Ndowooza ye ggaayi ayagala ennyo.
I don’t think anyone should.	Sirowooza nti waliwo omuntu yenna alina okubeera bw’atyo.
That doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri.
It’s my thing.	Kye kintu kyange.
I am not a human being.	Nze siri muntu yenna.
I have no idea what this could be	Sirina kirowoozo ku kino kye kiyinza okuba
But it’s not mine, either.	Naye si wange, naye.
I knew it better than anyone	Nnali nkimanyi okusinga omuntu yenna
Or so he did.	Oba bwe yakola.
I don’t want to be alone again	Saagala kuddamu kubeera nzekka
I wanted a boyfriend	Nnali njagala muganzi
I know it’s true	Nkimanyi nti kituufu
I wanted to see my doctor	Nnali njagala kulaba musawo wange
I wonder how it looks	Nze nneebuuza engeri gye kirabika
He couldn’t be here.	Yali tasobola kubeera wano.
And maybe not.	Era mpozzi nedda.
Or none at all.	Oba tewali n’akatono.
My father didn’t want to be my wife.	Taata yali tayagala kubeera mukyala wange.
The other one is me.	Omulala nze.
I thought it was a matter of making money	Nalowooza nti ensonga eri ku kukola ssente
But maybe not.	Naye mpozzi nedda.
So many things together.	Ebintu bingi nnyo nga tuli wamu.
He may already have.	Ayinza okuba nga yalina dda.
I didn’t know what it was at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi kye kyali
Probably tonight or tomorrow.	Oboolyawo ekiro kino oba enkya.
Not since last week.	Si okuva wiiki ewedde.
He makes things happen.	Akola ebintu okubaawo.
He knew it well enough.	Yali akimanyi bulungi.
He said that would do.	Yagambye nti ekyo kijja kukola.
And not too long ago.	Era si bbanga ddene nnyo emabega.
He was everything.	Yali buli kimu.
I think he is in me	Ndowooza ali mu nze
I thought he might be for a while.	Nalowooza nti yandiba okumala akaseera.
I can't, he said.	Sisobola, bwe yagamba.
But not this week.	Naye si wiiki eno.
That is a very important thing.	Ekyo kintu kikulu nnyo.
I pray for myself	Nze nsaba nze kennyini
What's going on?.	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso?.
I don’t know the answer to that.	Ekyo simanyi kya kuddamu.
He couldn’t see.	Yali tasobola kulaba.
His dad needs to talk to him.	Taata we yeetaaga okwogera naye.
I know they are here	Nkimanyi nti bali wano
He's sick.	Mulwadde.
Thinking of my brother, mostly.	Okulowooza ku muganda wange, okusinga.
I wanted to talk to him	Nnali njagala okwogera naye
It’s a lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi nnyo.
I can’t do this again	Kino sisobola kuddamu kukikola
She needed a father.	Yali yeetaaga taata.
I didn’t want anyone to talk to me	Nnali saagala muntu yenna kwogera nange
I was a very lucky woman.	Nali mukyala wa mukisa nnyo.
I had no idea what it was	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi kye kyali
He was ordinary.	Yali wa bulijjo.
But he’s like that.	Naye bw’atyo.
He can do whatever he wants.	Asobola okukola kyonna ky’ayagala.
I had no choice	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kukola
And in a way, they were.	Era mu ngeri emu, baali.
More than anyone else.	Okusinga omuntu omulala yenna.
Just like that other guy did.	Nga ggaayi oyo omulala bwe yakola.
And yet here we are.	Era naye wano we tuli.
Nobody wants to play with him.	Tewali ayagala kuzannya naye.
Exactly the same with knowledge.	Ekintu kye kimu ddala ne ku kumanya.
Me and you.	Nze naawe.
But he seemed happy to talk.	Naye yali alabika nga musanyufu okwogera.
It is the same here as everywhere.	Wano kye kimu ne buli wamu.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
No one worked harder.	Tewali yakola nnyo okusinga ekyo.
Maybe all of those things.	Mpozzi ebintu ebyo byonna.
I didn’t have that one	Oyo nnali sirina
I can talk to him and everything	Nsobola okwogera naye ne buli kimu
Whatever he was hoping for, not this.	Kyonna kye yali asuubira, si kino.
This is not a normal situation	Eno si mbeera ya bulijjo
I’m afraid it’s serious.	Ntya nti kya maanyi.
I just know it’s not true	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti si kituufu
I can hardly believe it	Nze sisobola bulungi kukkiriza
I am in trouble.	Ndi mu buzibu.
I hope he does well	Nsuubira nti akola bulungi
I was so in love with it	Nnali njagala nnyo
I can’t stay here	Siyinza kusigala wano
Just like us,’ he said.	Nga ffe,’ bwe yagambye.
Perhaps he hadn’t.	Oboolyawo yali talina.
I have a regular guy who does it	Nnina ggaayi wa bulijjo akikola
I don’t even know what.	Simanyi na kiki.
That was a terrible thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi nnyo.
I have to do it.	Nnina okukikola.
I can’t do this right now	Kino sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino
Faster than you.	Okusinga ggwe amangu.
But it can happen.	Naye kiyinza okubaawo.
He knew how to eat and it was basically the same thing.	Yali amanyi okulya era okusinga kyali kintu kye kimu.
I hoped it would be enough	Nali nsuubira nti kijja kumala
But you don’t know us either.	Naye tomanyi naffe.
And nothing is.	Era tewali kintu kyonna kiri.
That’s how it is now.	Kati bwe kiri.
I couldn’t wait to go	Nnali siyinza kulinda kugenda
He is.	Ali.
I didn’t know what to expect from a baby	Nnali simanyi kye nsuubira ku mwana
We just can’t.	Ffe tetusobola kyokka.
He says he doesn’t know.	Agamba nti tamanyi.
The food was excellent every time.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo buli kiseera.
I’m really happy.	Nze ndi musanyufu ddala.
He saw what he saw.	Yalaba kye yalaba.
I want to spend some time on that	Njagala okumala akaseera ku ekyo
He will probably be here soon.	Oboolyawo ajja kuba wano mu bbanga ttono.
It doesn’t really matter.	Si kikulu nnyo.
You are with him or with him.	Oli naye oba oli wamu naye.
No one knows what he looked like.	Tewali amanyi ngeri gye yali alabika.
I have a problem with this	Kino nnina obuzibu
I think that’s what he was doing	Ndowooza ekyo kye yali akola
It’s not dangerous.	Si kya bulabe.
I thought he wanted it this way	Nalowooza nti yali ayagala mu ngeri eno
I should have spoken sooner	Nnali nsaanidde okwogera amangu
I could find a place to live	Nnali nsobola okufuna we nnali mbeera
I was very happy at home	Nali musanyufu nnyo awaka
He didn’t want a relationship.	Yali tayagala mukwano.
I know he knows it.	Nkimanyi nti akimanyi.
Down ahead, now.	Wansi mu maaso, kati.
And in the hospital.	Era mu ddwaaliro.
I am his wife.	Nze mukyala we.
I want to play with him	Njagala kuzannya naye
I didn’t know it was so bad	Nnali simanyi nti kibi nnyo
But this is hard to see.	Naye kino kizibu okulaba.
There isn’t anything at all.	Tewali n’akatono.
Apparently he did whatever he wanted to do, too.	Kirabika naye yakola kyonna kye yali ayagala okukola, naye.
Completely ready to go.	Mwetegefu ddala okugenda.
I was hoping it would be him	Nali nsuubira nti yandibadde ye
It was just very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo kyokka.
I can’t do everything.	Sisobola kukola buli kimu.
But it was the case.	Naye bwe kyali.
I can tell you were very lucky	Nsobola okugamba nti wali wa mukisa nnyo
Really, he actually said that.	Ddala, mu butuufu yayogera ekyo.
I wanted to know what he was really thinking	Nnali njagala okumanya kye yali alowooza ddala
But in reality it is not.	Naye mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
I couldn’t tell anyone	Nnali sisobola kubuulira muntu yenna
That seems very difficult now.	Ekyo kirabika kizibu nnyo kati.
I always need help	Bulijjo nneetaaga obuyambi
I don’t want to know who it is	Saagala kumanya ani
Not the person in front.	Si muntu mu maaso.
Not everywhere, of course.	Si buli wamu, ddala.
I thought it was anyway	Nalowooza nti bwe kiri mu ngeri yonna
And it’s good.	Era kirungi.
I will have to read the book now!	Nja kuba nnina okusoma ekitabo kati!
But he was talking.	Naye yali ayogera.
Then someone thought.	Awo omuntu n’alowooza.
I’m sorry to say it’s true	Nsonyiwa okugamba nti mazima
Maybe it was too easy.	Mpozzi nga kyali kyangu nnyo.
He wanted to do this alone, anyway.	Kino yali ayagala kukikola yekka, mu ngeri yonna.
I couldn’t believe my luck	Nali sisobola kukkiriza mukisa gwange
I'm not sure though	Sikakasa wadde
I just wanted to be comfortable	Nnali njagala kubeera bulungi kyokka
Both of them are.	Bombi bwe bali.
He had his plan.	Yalina enteekateeka ye.
It will know everything.	Kijja kumanya buli kimu.
You will never work again.	Tojja kuddamu kukola.
Nobody really talks to me like that	Mu butuufu tewali ayogera nange bw’atyo
It is a very dangerous thing to do.	Kintu kya bulabe nnyo okukola.
That doesn’t matter right now.	Ekyo si kikulu mu kiseera kino.
He knew that without being able to say how.	Ekyo yali akimanyi nga tasobola kwogera ngeri ki.
There is so much more.	Waliwo bingi nnyo.
I really didn’t have a plan, and now he knew that	Mazima ddala nnali sirina nteekateeka era kati ekyo yali akimanyi
You don’t know what you want.	Tomanyi kyoyagala.
He has been for a while.	Abadde okumala akaseera.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
I love being with him	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye
You can do it.	Osobola okukikola.
No, no, no, no.	Nedda, nedda, nedda.
I can see how that would be a problem	Nsobola okulaba engeri ekyo gye kyandibadde ekizibu
But he is the only one who speaks.	Naye ye yekka ayogera.
And he won’t.	Era tajja.
I actually thought it was pretty cool.	Mu butuufu nnalowooza nti kyali kirungi nnyo.
But he couldn't speak.	Naye yali tasobola kwogera.
I want to believe.	Njagala kukkiriza.
I know what he would like	Nkimanyi kye yandiyagadde
Today his person was me.	Leero omuntu we yali nze.
He could hit very well	Yali asobola okukuba obulungi ennyo
I couldn’t tell if he was still here or not	Nali sisobola kumanya oba yali akyali wano oba nedda
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
I knew it was something	Namanya nti kyali kintu
In any case.	Mu mbeera yonna.
He was telling the truth about you too.	Naawe yali ayogera mazima ku ggwe.
But no idea why.	Naye tewali kirowoozo lwaki.
Very nice to see.	Kirungi nnyo okulaba.
But it would be nice.	Naye kyandibadde kirungi.
I love her as a friend	Njagala nnyo nga mukwano gwange
I think he knows what’s going on	Ndowooza amanyi ekigenda mu maaso
I’m not sure what’s going on.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
And of course, it could be any one of us.	Era ddala, kyandibadde omu ku ffe yenna.
I’m glad you’re here with me	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano nange
I am so glad you are here	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti oli wano
I know this is the place	Nkimanyi nti kino kye kifo
He is still in trouble.	Akyali mu buzibu.
I have no idea.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
I want so much more than this	Njagala bingi nnyo okusinga bino
But you’re coming.	Naye ggwe ojja.
But so far, so good.	Naye okutuuka wano, kirungi nnyo.
I can.	Nsobola.
You know that’s not the truth.	Omanyi ekyo si kye kituufu.
No, it really isn’t.	Nedda, ddala si bwe kiri.
He is not real.	Si wa ddala.
I couldn’t wait until my wedding	Nnali sisobola kulinda okutuusa ku mbaga yange
He knew what he was doing that night.	Yali amanyi kye yali akola ekiro ekyo.
Now you’re here.	Kati oli wano.
You never know what’s going to happen.	Tomanyi kigenda kubaawo.
Here he was ready.	Wano yali mwetegefu.
So far, no luck.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali mukisa.
I’m going to drive away.	Ngenda kuvuga mmotoka ne ngenda.
I didn’t know you loved working.	Nnali simanyi nti oyagala nnyo okukola.
I really had no idea	Mazima ddala nnali sirina kye mmanyi
I didn’t know he would come back	Nnali simanyi nti ajja kudda
At all times.	Ku buli kiseera.
I wanted to talk to him	Nnali njagala okwogera naye
I don’t even know what.	Simanyi na kiki.
But since.	Naye okuva...
I doubt he’s asleep	Nbuusabuusa nti yeebase
However, I am not sure.	Kyokka, sikakasa.
He was trying to do it.	Yali agezaako okukikola.
Something he had	Ekintu kye yalina
That he does so only the person knows.	Nti akola bw’atyo omuntu oyo yekka akimanyi.
In the room.	Mu kisenge.
I won’t have any of that on my watch	Sijja kuba na kintu kyonna ku ebyo ku ssaawa yange
I have to say she is pretty good	Nnina okugamba nti mulungi nnyo
I think we should move on	Ndowooza tusaanidde okugenda mu maaso
Not too much of it.	Si bingi nnyo.
They are in the room.	Bali mu kisenge.
He could probably do it now.	Oboolyawo yali asobola okukikola kati.
Same thing with me, in a way.	Ekintu kye kimu ne nange, mu ngeri emu.
You seem convinced.	Olabika okakasa.
You said no.	Wagamba nti nedda.
I didn’t know who it was	Nnali simanyi ani
One must be real or not	Omuntu alina okuba nga ddala oba nedda
I'll go with him	Nja kugenda naye
I still can’t figure out what it was	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kumanya kye kyali
I will get help.	Nja kufuna obuyambi.
That was exactly the case.	Ddala bwe kyali ekyo.
This is what we have.	Kino kye tulina.
He was in his room, you know.	Yali mu kisenge kye, omanyi.
I didn’t know what to do, either.	Nange nnali simanyi kya kukola, era.
He knew it would happen soon too.	Yali akimanyi nti naye kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono.
This is a real job.	Guno mulimu gwa ddala.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
It’s a terrible idea.	Kirowoozo kibi nnyo.
However, that is not the issue here.	Kyokka eyo si y’ensonga wano.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
He had to live in her.	Yalina okubeera mu ye.
I wanted to see.	Nnali njagala kulaba.
He must, and will be a party.	Ateekwa, era ajja kuba wa kibiina.
And he wanted to help.	Era yali ayagala okuyamba.
Opinion.	Endowooza.
In the car.	Mu mmotoka.
I want.	Njagala.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
I know you may be aware of this	Nkimanyi nti kino oyinza okuba nga okimanyi
He didn’t need an hour.	Yali teyeetaaga ssaawa emu.
I can’t get anything done	Sisobola kufuna kintu kyonna kukola
And he is in this movie.	Era ali mu firimu eno.
I have a lot to do tomorrow	Nnina bingi bye nkola enkya
But he won’t be of any help to you.	Naye tajja kuba kya buyambi bwonna gy’oli.
That’s very true here.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo wano.
A little while ago.	Akaseera katono emabega.
You're really good with her, she said.	Ddala oli mulungi naye, bwe yagambye.
I know what it is like	Nze mmanyi bwe kiri
You know.	Omanyi.
I don’t need anything	Sirina kye nneetaaga
I want to remain a man	Njagala kusigala nga ndi musajja
But not much.	Naye si bingi.
He wants a reason.	Ayagala ensonga.
It’s a lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi nnyo.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
I think he couldn’t really talk	Ndowooza mu butuufu yali tasobola kwogera
What a lot of it.	Nga bingi.
I could do it myself	Nnali nsobola okukikola nzekka
He was the best at everything.	Yali asinga mu buli kimu.
I didn’t want to see	Nnali saagala kulaba
He wasn’t the man he was.	Si ye musajja gwe yali.
I was nowhere near that	Nnali sirina we nnali kumpi awo
That was certainly it.	Mazima ddala ekyo kye kyali.
I still can’t.	N’okutuusa kati sisobola.
In fact, that is not the case.	Mu butuufu ekyo si bwe kiri.
I am together at my work.	Nze ndi wamu ku mulimu gwange.
He, like.	Ye, nga.
I needed help, but there was none	Nnali nneetaaga obuyambi, naye nga tewali
I'm not entirely sure about that.	Sikakasa ddala ku ekyo.
I didn’t think he would even want to talk to me	Nnali sirowooza nti yandiyagadde wadde okwogera nange
But it is very powerful.	Naye kya maanyi nnyo.
No, it’s just you.	Nedda, ggwe wekka.
I am on one right now.	Ndi ku emu mu kiseera kino.
I know you love to read	Nkimanyi nti oyagala nnyo okusoma
I hope he does.	Nsuubira nti akikola.
I love to work.	Njagala nnyo okukola.
This could happen again.	Kino kiyinza okuddamu okubaawo.
I know very well how good you are.	Nze mmanyi bulungi nnyo engeri gy’oli omulungi.
I should have gone to work.	Nze wandibadde ngenda ku mulimu.
He wanted to deal with every problem.	Yali ayagala okukola ku buli kizibu.
It was his idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kye.
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
But it was the case.	Naye bwe kyali.
That was probably it.	Ekyo oboolyawo kye kyali.
This was a very important step.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
I don’t want to go without you.	Saagala kugenda nga tolina.
I am not and cannot be	Siri era siyinza kubeera
I guess not really	Ntebereza nti mu butuufu si bwe kiri
I couldn’t do it before.	Nnali sisobola kukikola emabegako.
Not about anything too much.	Si ku kintu kyonna nnyo.
That’s not the problem.	Ekyo si kye kizibu.
That's really good though.	Ekyo kirungi ddala wadde.
I was ready to do it	Nnali mwetegefu okukikola
I know that he has.	Nkimanyi nti alina.
It is good to do that.	Kirungi okukola ekyo.
You will do well.	Ojja kukola bulungi.
But he is still young.	Naye akyali muto.
. . . .	.
That’s what I think.	Kye ndowooza.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kintu kibi nnyo.
He is very friendly.	Ye wa mukwano nnyo.
He said he couldn’t.	Yagambye nti tasobola.
I think quickly.	Ndowooza mangu.
I really wanted it right now	Nnali njagala nnyo mu kiseera kino
Almost everything, actually.	Kumpi buli kimu, mu butuufu.
They were strong.	Baali ba maanyi.
I will definitely buy from them again!	Mazima ddala nja kuddamu okugula okuva gye bali!
I was in love with it	Nali njagala nnyo
But he thinks.	Naye alowooza.
He said it was mine.	Yagambye nti yange.
I know he was afraid it would be me.	Nkimanyi yali atya nti yandibadde nze.
I’m onto something that I don’t quite know what it is.	Nze ndi ku kintu nga simanyi bulungi kye kiri.
I always wondered why he did that	Bulijjo nnali nneebuuza lwaki yakola bw’atyo
I know next to nothing about him.	Nze kumpi sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
I’ll talk to you about everything	Nja kwogera naawe ku buli kimu
But he has it.	Naye alina.
This is a busy time for me.	Kino kiseera kya bbize gyendi.
Today it was a house.	Leero yali nnyumba.
We just have to do it.	Tulina okukikola kyokka.
Everything is exactly as it is.	Buli kimu kiri ddala nga bwe kiri.
I couldn’t be with anyone	Nnali sisobola kubeera na muntu yenna
I need to eat his dinner	Nze nneetaaga okulya ekyeggulo kye
So far he has.	N’okutuusa kati alina...
I’m not sure if you knew that.	Sikakasa oba ekyo wali okimanyi.
I have plenty of time	Nnina obudde bungi
I’m fine with him being here.	Nze ndi bulungi naye okubeera wano.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
Today, tomorrow, next week.	Leero, enkya, wiiki ejja.
Not even here.	Si wadde wano.
But he couldn’t try.	Naye yali tasobola kugezaako.
He has to work.	Alina okukola.
And this is very important here.	Era kino kikulu nnyo wano.
I love it here.	Njagala nnyo wano.
We should each work hard on that.	Ffe buli omu tusaanidde okukola ennyo ku nsonga eyo.
It goes for every issue.	Kigenda ku buli nsonga.
I know how to read this	Nze mmanyi okusoma bino
That this is dangerous.	Nti kino kya bulabe.
That was the real problem.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu ennyo.
I might do it again	Nnyinza okuddamu okukikola
However, you have to do it right.	Kyokka olina okukikola obulungi.
He belonged to the congregation.	Yali wa kibiina.
I think it’s true	Ndowooza nti kituufu
He won't come.	Tajja kujja.
Indeed, he said.	Mazima ddala, bwe yagamba.
He was just a nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi yekka.
I was the one.	Nze nnali omu.
This is a quick one.	Kino kya bwangu.
I only know what he told me.	Nze kye yang’amba kyokka kye mmanyi.
I can certainly do with this now	Mazima ddala nsobola okukola ne kino kati
I think he's asleep	Ndowooza yeebase
I couldn’t eat anything.	Nnali sisobola kulya kintu kyonna.
I can’t be dealing with this right now	Kino siyinza kuba nga nkola ku nsonga eno mu kiseera kino
It is a tremendous amount of work.	Omulimu gwa maanyi nnyo.
He could buy what he needed.	Yali asobola okugula kye yali yeetaaga.
I couldn’t have been better	Nnali siyinza kuba okusinga ekyo
No one spoke, not knowing what was going on.	Tewali yayogera, nga tamanyi kigenda mu maaso.
I knew you were on to something	Namanya nti oli ku kintu
I said it was going to happen	Nagamba nti kigenda kubaawo
I didn’t know he was in this town.	Nali simanyi nti ali mu kibuga kino.
I need someone like you	Nze nneetaaga omuntu nga ggwe
Not anything, really.	Si kintu kyonna, ddala.
I'm not sure where it is here	Sikakasa wano we wali
And everyone else here did the same.	Era buli omu omulala wano yakola kye kimu.
I'm the only child there	Nze mwana nzekka awo
I’m glad you’re okay.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli bulungi.
I wanted to know what was going on	Nnali njagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
Today, not so much.	Leero, si nnyo.
And that’s what he wanted to do.	Era ekyo kye yali ayagala okukola.
We are together now.	Tuli wamu kati.
I just have to be ready	Nnina kuba mwetegefu kyokka
Me and you.	Nze naawe.
But we are here to help.	Naye tuli wano okuyamba.
My father did the only thing he could do.	Taata yakola ekintu kyokka kye yali asobola okukola.
But he was busy.	Naye yali bbize.
I know this for a reason	Kino nkimanyi lwa nsonga
You’re sure you don’t want to.	Okakasa nti toyagala.
He couldn't speak, but he didn't need to.	Yali tasobola kwogera, naye nga teyeetaaga kwogera.
He didn’t know what love was.	Yali tamanyi kwagala kye ki.
There was no way he didn't know about it.	Tewali ngeri gye yali tamanyi ku nsonga eno.
To...	Ku...
I knew why, but I couldn’t say anything	Nnali mmanyi lwaki, naye nga sisobola kwogera kintu kyonna
That is what can happen.	Ekyo kye kiyinza okubaawo.
I wasn’t sure if he was working or not.	Nali sikakasa oba yali akola oba nedda.
I love my house here	Njagala nnyo ennyumba yange wano
But no one is coming.	Naye tewali ajja.
He was really at home.	Ddala yali waka.
He is not dangerous.	Si wa bulabe.
I thought you were	Nze nalowooza nti ggwe oli
I think he’ll be fine	Ndowooza ajja kuba bulungi
I didn’t know why	Nze nali simanyi nsonga lwaki
He won’t know.	Tajja kumanya.
I am not sure what to say.	Sikakasa kya kwogera.
But he had to act quickly.	Naye yalina okukola amangu.
We should both be there.	Ffembi tusaanidde okubaawo.
I’ve been thinking about the situation	Mbadde ndowooza ku mbeera
Today in fact.	Leero mu butuufu.
And of course everything was great.	Era ddala buli kimu kyali kirungi nnyo.
He does that when he needs time to think.	Ekyo akikola nga yeetaaga obudde okulowooza.
I need to be ready	Nze nneetaaga okuba nga mwetegefu
I always wondered that	Ekyo bulijjo nnali nneebuuza
It seems a little complicated to me.	Kirabika nga kizibu katono gyendi.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I don’t know if that would be it.	Ekyo simanyi oba kye kyandibadde.
Here it was.	Wano we kyali.
I was doing the exact same thing	Nze nali nkola ekintu kye kimu ddala
I am not a thinking man.	Siri musajja alowooza.
It was just an idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kyokka.
It was so close.	Yali kumpi nnyo.
Certainly.	Mazima ddala.
I really need help	Nneetaaga nnyo obuyambi
I can’t dwell too long on this	Siyinza kumala bbanga ddene ku nsonga eno
He is on	Ali ku .
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I really like that guy.	Njagala nnyo ggaayi oyo.
How could he be.	Yandibadde atya okuba.
I love it, you know	Njagala nnyo, omanyi
I expected more though	Nali nsuubira bingi wadde
I almost couldn’t do it	Kumpi nnali sisobola kukikola
The only problem is who.	Ekizibu kyokka kiri nti ani.
You can’t let that happen.	Ekyo tosobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
I was really feeling strong now	Ddala nnali mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi kati
I knew what we needed to do though	Nali mmanyi kye twali twetaaga okukola wadde
I thought it was true	Nalowooza nti kituufu
I knew what he was doing	Nnali mmanyi kye yali akola
He was asleep on his side.	Yali yeebase ku ludda lwe.
I really wanted to say no	Nnali njagala nnyo okugamba nti nedda
However, it doesn’t matter.	Kyokka, si kikulu.
I was hoping it was you	Nali nsuubira nti ggwe
I’m not sure here.	Sikakasa wano.
And as on from.	Era nga ku okuva.
I have no idea where it is	Sirina kye mmanyi gye kiri
He was alone for a while.	Yali yekka okumala akaseera.
He says it is very important.	Agamba nti kikulu nnyo.
I was a little early	Nali nga bukyali katono
But not a real child.	Naye si mwana ddala.
I couldn’t say the same about him	Nze nali siyinza kwogera kye kimu ku ye
I need to talk to him.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye.
He is a nice guy.	Ye ggaayi omulungi.
He said he needed to talk to me.	Yagamba nti yeetaaga okwogera nange.
I know this is not easy for you either	Nkimanyi kino naawe si kyangu gyoli
Of this I knew nothing	Ku bino nnali simanyi kintu kyonna
He didn’t really want a baby, yet.	Mu butuufu yali tayagala mwana, nga tannaba.
It was very dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
I would love to talk to you	Njagala nnyo okwogera naawe
I’m afraid to move on	Ntya okugenda mu maaso
I have to go to work	Nnina okugenda ku mulimu
However, I feel young	Kyokka mpulira nga ndi muto
If that were true.	Singa ekyo kyali kituufu.
I don’t even know what it is.	Nze simanyi na kiki kye kiri.
I will win again tonight	Nja kuddamu okuwangula ekiro kino
But he was only a child.	Naye yali mwana muto yekka.
Here and here.	Wano ne wano.
I really like these	Njagala nnyo bino
I’m always curious about things like this	Bulijjo njagala nnyo okumanya ebintu nga bino
That’s the right thing to do.	Kye kituufu.
You were just you.	Ggwe wali ggwe wekka.
We are very close to that now.	Ekyo tuli kumpi nnyo kati.
I wonder what it would be like	Nneebuuza bwe kyandibadde
I don’t know what day it is	Simanyi lunaku ki
I've been here awhile.	Mbadde wano akaseera.
He certainly didn’t know.	Mazima ddala yali tamanyi.
He has no power.	Talina maanyi.
He said he would do it.	Yagambye nti agenda kukikola.
This is my job.	Guno gwe mulimu gwange.
He has a reason.	Alina ensonga.
You know that.	Ekyo okimanyi.
I know that, he knows that.	Ekyo nkimanyi, ekyo akimanyi.
You knew he would be there, of course.	Obadde okimanyi nti ajja kubaawo, ddala.
It was good, really good.	Kyali kirungi, ddala kirungi.
I don’t think it is.	Ndowooza si bwe kiri.
That can be hard to see.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu okulaba.
It is what it might be.	Kye kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
He had no reason to be there.	Yali talina nsonga lwaki yali awo.
Now was the time, he was saying.	Kati kye kiseera, yali agamba.
And it’s in you too.	Era naawe kiri mu ggwe.
He is a man of hope.	Ye musajja alina essuubi.
He said no problem for me.	Yagamba nti tewali kizibu kyonna gyendi.
Anything can happen.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo.
What was he thinking.	Kiki kye yali alowooza.
I can do it faster.	Nsobola okukikola mu bwangu.
That may be the case.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
A little but not much	Katono naye si bingi
I thought it was great.	Nalowooza nti kirungi nnyo.
This is the week.	Eno ye wiiki.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
In fact, you don’t even have to.	Mu butuufu tolina wadde okukola.
I didn’t know he had it in him	Nnali simanyi nti alina mu ye
Something about that mattered.	Ekintu ku ekyo kyali kikulu.
I needed a best friend	Nnali nneetaaga mukwano gwange asinga
I can’t do it	Sisobola kukikola
I sure hope you do too.	Nkakasa nsuubira naawe okola.
He could do the same with his brother.	Yali asobola okukola ekintu kye kimu ne muganda we.
I was always afraid	Bulijjo nnali ntya
I couldn’t have done it better	Nnali siyinza kukikola okusinga ekyo
I don’t think so.	Sirowooza nti.
He was a guy you knew well.	Yali ggaayi gwe wali omanyi obulungi.
I could do it, though	Kyokka nnali nsobola okukikola
That one I wasn’t ready to answer	Oyo nnali siri mwetegefu kuddamu
I'm sure.	Nkakasa.
I didn’t know what it was	Nnali simanyi kye kyali
I want to work with you	Njagala kukola naawe
I know you’re happy	Nkimanyi nti oli musanyufu
I love you too	Naawe njagala nnyo
I need to go away.	Nze nneetaaga okugenda.
Not just now.	Si kati kyokka.
I knew if he came, he would go	Namanya nti singa ajja, ajja kugenda
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
I guess that’s all we can do	Ntebereza nti ekyo kyokka kye tusobola okukola
Everything will help.	Buli kimu kijja kuyamba.
I wanted to be there early	Nnali njagala kubeerawo nga bukyali
It is on everything.	Kiri ku buli kimu.
He was glad he had.	Yali musanyufu nti yalina.
It would be right.	Kyandibadde kituufu.
But, as it is, there is only me.	Naye, nga bwe kiri, waliwo nze nzekka.
It was very beautiful.	Yali nnungi nnyo.
I thought you were coming alone	Nalowooza nti ojja wekka
Very well, he would have to go.	Kirungi nnyo, yandibadde alina okugenda.
That's real.	Eyo ya ddala.
Doing an excellent job.	Okukola omulimu omulungi ennyo.
He is here with me now.	Ali wano nange kati.
I actually loved it	Mu butuufu nnali njagala nnyo
I thought, maybe.	Nalowooza, mpozzi.
I know, easier said than done	Nkimanyi, kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola
I don’t think you can.	Sirowooza nti osobola.
I couldn’t do it alone	Nnali sisobola kukikola nzekka
I was hoping you would like it	Nnali nsuubira nti wandyagadde
I have to know everything that is going on	Nnina okumanya buli kimu ekigenda mu maaso
He had something he needed.	Yalina kye yeetaaga.
It is very, very close right now.	Kiri kumpi nnyo nnyo mu kiseera kino.
They were very dangerous at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo baali ba bulabe nnyo.
Now, not so much.	Kati, si nnyo.
Someone needs a job	Omuntu yeetaaga omulimu
I didn’t know much about anything at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi nnyo kintu kyonna
I was so excited	Nnali musanyufu nnyo
Who do you think makes money on that.	Olowooza ani akola ssente ku ekyo.
I wanted this.	Kino nnali njagala.
I was working hard	Nnali nkola nnyo
It’s hard to read.	Kizibu okusoma.
I need to think about this	Nze nneetaaga okulowooza ku kino
I loved my wife, and loved her in return	Nnali njagala nnyo mukyala wange, era ne njagala mu kuddamu
He doesn’t have anyone.	Talina muntu yenna.
I can’t wait to go home	Siyinza kulinda kudda waka
I didn’t know much about it	Nnali simanyi bingi ku nsonga eyo
I’m not sure that’s true.	Sikakasa nti ekyo kituufu.
He does this.	Kino akikola.
Maybe to another.	Mpozzi eri omulala.
I just needed to talk to him about something	Nnali nneetaaga kwogera naye ku kintu kyokka
Now, that is obviously not the case.	Kati, kirabika ekyo si bwe kiri.
He hoped it wasn’t.	Yalina essuubi nti si bwe kiri.
It’s not for you.	Si gy’oli.
But you can’t do that.	Naye ekyo tosobola kukikola.
That doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri.
I want to talk about us	Njagala kwogera ku ffe
He wants to know who it is.	Ayagala kumanya ani.
I wish they were together	Njagala nnyo nga bali bombi
I was always very sick	Bulijjo nnali mulwadde nnyo
Probably even they were.	Oboolyawo ne bwe baali.
We're going downstairs.	Tugenda wansi.
I was feeling good about it	Nnali mpulira bulungi ku nsonga eyo
I don’t want to be here at all	Saagala kubeera wano n’akatono
And that’s not the case at all.	Era ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
This is very difficult.	Kino nga kizibu nnyo.
I had no choice, but that’s not the point	Nnali sirina kya kukola naye eyo si y’ensonga
And it’s really quite simple.	Era ddala kyangu nnyo.
I think this is happy	Ndowooza kino musanyufu
You know what’s going to happen.	Omanyi ekigenda okubaawo.
You know, you don’t have to do that.	Omanyi, ekyo tolina kukikola.
You can always do it.	Bulijjo osobola.
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
Tom could see nothing.	Tom yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
That might help.	Ekyo kiyinza okuyamba.
She was so nice and pretty.	Yali mulungi nnyo era nga mulungi nnyo.
I wanted to do it.	Nnali njagala okukikola.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
Maybe he's not well, he thought.	Mpozzi tali bulungi, bwe yalowooza.
You don’t have to work.	Tolina kuba na kukola.
It is a very good idea.	Kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
It was just an idea	Kyali kirowoozo kyokka
Everything is fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi.
I thought it might be pretty simple	Nalowooza nti kiyinza okuba nga kyangu nnyo
I hope he knows that	Nsuubira ekyo akimanyi
We are here to help.	Tuli wano okuyamba.
to that.	eri ekyo.
You probably should go too.	Oboolyawo naawe wandibadde ogenda.
I know something is going to happen	Nze mmanyi nti waliwo ekigenda okubaawo
I hope everyone is happy	Nsuubira buli omu musanyufu
We will do that.	Ekyo tujja kukikola.
See where we are.	Si we tuli.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo yakikola.
Not one penny will he receive.	Tewali ssente emu ajja kufuna.
It was a very important one.	Kyali kikulu nnyo.
He is fine now.	Ali bulungi kati.
I knew that was it	Namanya nti ekyo kye kyali
I thought this was a little too easy	Nalowooza nti kino kyali kyangu nnyo katono
I wasn’t sure who he was talking to	Nali sikakasa ani gwe yali ayogera naye
He says we are too.	Agamba nti naffe tuli.
This will continue.	Kino kijja kugenda mu maaso.
I’m hungry too.	Nze nange enjala enjala.
However, I knew it was going to happen	Kyokka nnali nkimanyi nti kigenda kubaawo
I think this is a great idea	Ndowooza kino kirowoozo kirungi nnyo
We have it every day.	Tulina buli lunaku.
I’m afraid that’s true	Ntya nti ekyo kituufu
Not to.	Si ku.
I don’t want to go on	Saagala kugenda mu maaso
I think it’s too low.	Ndowooza nti wansi nnyo.
I can’t let that happen	Ekyo sisobola kukkiriza kubaawo
He wanted that very much.	Ekyo yali ayagala nnyo.
I have to go to the hospital tonight	Nnina okugenda mu ddwaaliro ekiro kino
I have no idea about this	Kino sirina kye mmanyi
I have no problem with anything.	Sirina buzibu ku kintu kyonna.
You know that.	Ekyo okimanyi.
It’s a lucky thing.	Kintu kya mukisa.
I want to be his friend	Njagala kubeera mukwano gwe
No one knew why.	Tewali yali amanyi lwaki.
As it was before.	Nga bwe kyali emabegako.
I thought about that one a lot.	Oyo nnalowooza nnyo.
He is very good at that.	Ekyo mulungi nnyo mu nsonga eyo.
You have to be happy.	Olina okuba nga musanyufu.
The age is yes.	Si ye ye.
In fact, that’s not the case at all.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
I didn’t know what to believe.	Nnali simanyi kya kukkiriza.
Thus it is not faith.	Bwatyo si kukkiriza.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
But in any case.	Naye mu mbeera yonna.
We need to talk.	Twetaaga okwogera.
The only thing we can do.	Ekintu kyokka kye tusobola okukola.
This was good in this regard.	Kino yali mulungi mu nsonga eno.
I knew what he was planning	Namanya kye yali ateekateeka
I can definitely do that	Ekyo nsobola okukikola ddala
I guess everyone was sleeping in	Ntebereza buli omu yali yeebase mu
No, it wasn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kyali.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
I loved my father.	Taata nnali njagala nnyo.
I feel so desperate	Mpulira nga nfunye essuubi ddene
I have to go away for a while	Nnina okugenda okumala akaseera
I didn’t know, but it felt good	Nnali simanyi naye nga mpulira bulungi
He told me he couldn’t stay much longer.	Yang’amba nti yali tasobola kumala bbanga ddene nnyo.
You know exactly.	Omanyi bulungi.
I think of her son	Ndowooza ku mwana we
He said he knew the guy.	Yagambye nti amanyi ggaayi.
Can anyone please help.	Waliwo asobola nsaba okuyamba.
I think everyone did everything they could do.	Ndowooza buli muntu yakola buli kimu kye yali asobola okukola.
We’re going to have something.	Tugenda kuba tulina kye tulina.
He needed to make a call.	Yali yeetaaga okukuba essimu.
She wanted, she wanted.	Yali ayagala, yali ayagala.
He needed so much more.	Yali yeetaaga bingi nnyo.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
This was going to be a big deal.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kikulu nnyo.
I can’t do anything at all	Sisobola kukola kintu kyonna n’akatono
I'll try those things.	Nja kugezaako ebintu ebyo.
I need to talk to him about it	Nnina okwogera naye ku nsonga eyo
He doesn’t even know about it.	Tamanyi na ku nsonga eyo.
He doesn’t want or need anything.	Talina ky’ayagala oba kye yeetaaga.
I need to know he is not well	Nnina okumanya nti tali bulungi
And it was probably true.	Era oboolyawo kyali kituufu.
Not that he was very dangerous.	Si nti yali wa bulabe nnyo.
But you have a book.	Naye olina ekitabo.
I know how true this is for me.	Nkimanyi nti kino kituufu nnyo gyendi.
Without knowing it.	Nga tamanyi.
He really, really hoped he had.	Yalina ddala, ddala essuubi nti yalina.
I’m those things.	Nze ebintu ebyo.
But why do you want it so much now.	Naye lwaki oyagala nnyo kati.
In fact, it’s great for you.	Mu butuufu, kirungi nnyo gy’oli.
No, he couldn’t believe it.	Nedda, yali tasobola kukkiriza.
I know it better now.	Nze nkimanyi bulungi kati.
And his dad will do it.	Era taata we ajja kukikola.
I am ready to do this job	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola omulimu guno
I didn’t want to be like him	Nnali saagala kubeera nga ye
For the most part this is true.	Okusinga kino kituufu.
I have to make it back home	Nnina okukikola okudda eka
I thought everyone knew it	Nalowooza nti buli omu akimanyi
I want to get out of all this	Njagala okuva mu bino byonna
I want to be comfortable	Njagala kubeera bulungi
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
I can’t do it without you.	Siyinza kukikola nga tolina.
We’ll be here.	Tujja kuba wano.
I thought this was quite normal	Kino nnalowooza nti kyali kya bulijjo nnyo
From that moment on, we were always together.	Okuva mu kiseera ekyo, bulijjo twali tuli wamu.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
But he can’t do that.	Naye ekyo tasobola kukikola.
I have nothing bad to say about it.	Sirina kibi kye nnyinza kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
It’s just too complicated.	Kizibu nnyo kyokka.
That’s not the point.	Eyo si y’ensonga.
Of course, it doesn’t really matter.	Kya lwatu nti mu butuufu si kikulu.
I don't want to.	Saagala.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
And that will be the problem.	Era ekyo kye kijja okuba ekizibu.
He is a beautiful thing.	Ye kintu kirungi nnyo.
I know what it’s like to be just like everyone else	Nkimanyi bwe kiri okubeera nga buli muntu yekka
Now she looked better, she thought.	Kati yali alabika bulungi, bwe yalowooza.
I have to eat dinner	Nnina okulya ekyeggulo
Way.	Engeri.
I don’t want a doctor.	Saagala musawo.
He will be.	Ajja kuba.
But he's there.	Naye ali awo.
That’s really bad.	Ekyo ddala kibi.
I think that might work	Ndowooza ekyo kiyinza okukola
But that’s not the point.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga.
But he wanted to stay.	Naye yali ayagala kusigala.
He said it wasn’t.	Yagambye nti si bwe kiri.
I can’t stay here.	Sisobola kusigala wano.
I really have to go now	Ddala nnina okugenda kati
You are his best friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwe asinga.
You are so beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo.
I guess we all were in a way	Ntebereza nti ffenna twali mu ngeri emu
I will definitely do it again	Mazima ddala nja kuddamu okukikola
I haven’t got anything.	Nze sirina kye nfunye.
I wish he had known.	Njagala nnyo singa yali akimanyi.
But anything can happen!.	Naye ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo!.
I knew it actually wasn’t.	Namanya nti mu butuufu si bwe kyali.
He thought backwards.	Yalowooza emabega.
But what could he do? 	Naye kiki kye yali asobola okukola?
And you.	Naawe.
You are a good person.	Oli muntu mulungi.
I didn’t know what to say at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi kya kwogera
I guess that's why he's like that.	Ntebereza y'ensonga lwaki ali bw'atyo.
He wants to be friends.	Ayagala kubeera mikwano.
It was really nice even though it was in the city.	Yali nnungi ddala wadde nga yali mu kibuga.
You were alone.	Ggwe wali wekka.
But he was real.	Naye yali wa ddala.
They are and so are we.	Bali era naffe bwe tuli.
But where .	Naye wa .
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
I know you love to read.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala nnyo okusoma.
I guess he was happy	Ntebereza nti yali musanyufu
I'll make the call.	Nja kukola essimu.
I really had no idea what to expect	Mu butuufu nnali sirina kye mmanyi kye nsuubira
This is a very difficult problem for me.	Kino kizibu kizibu nnyo gyendi.
Attitude is everything.	Endowooza kye buli kimu.
We are friends now.	Tuli ba mukwano kati.
I can’t really.	Sisobola ddala.
I already knew that.	Ekyo nnali mmanyi dda.
But a little bit.	Naye katono.
And to me.	Ne gyendi.
I have no idea about that.	Ekyo sirina kye mmanyi.
However, this is not a problem.	Kyokka kino si kizibu.
I can read here as follows	Nsobola okusoma wano nga bwe kiri wansi
It's good you're there when he does.	Kirungi oli awo nga ye akola.
We can’t have anything.	Tetusobola kuba na kintu kyonna.
To be strong.	Okubeera amaanyi.
I didn’t want to eat anything	Nnali sirina kye njagala kulya
And he was good to me.	Era yali mulungi gyendi.
Which maybe it is.	Ekintu mpozzi nga bwe kiri.
I can’t wait to be a dad, actually	Siyinza kulinda kubeera taata, mu butuufu
He said he would do it.	Yagamba nti ajja kukikola.
I wondered all night	Nnali nneebuuza ekiro kyonna
I might be working at home myself.	Nze kennyini nnyinza okuba nga nkola awaka.
And it will be.	Era kijja kuba.
I thought it would be hard	Nalowooza nti kijja kuba kizibu
It's not going.	Si kugenda.
I was supposed to go tonight	Nnali wa kugenda ekiro kino
I just need to do it from this room	Nze nneetaaga okukikola okuva mu kisenge kino kyokka
Everyone knows that.	Ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
I wasn’t sure he was even real	Nnali sikakasa nti yali wadde wa ddala
This is going to happen.	Kino kigenda kubaawo.
It’s time to act.	Kye kiseera okukola.
But it’s not too difficult.	Naye si kizibu nnyo.
I knew you had it in you	Namanya nti olina mu ggwe
He was like that.	Yali bw’atyo.
It doesn’t really matter.	Si kikulu nnyo.
Or he says he thought so.	Oba agamba nti yalowooza bw’atyo.
He, however, was glad they were.	Kyokka ye yali musanyufu nti bwe baali.
Perhaps you do.	Oboolyawo olina.
I didn’t want to be around him	Nnali saagala kubeera kumpi naye
I have to do it right.	Nnina okukikola obulungi.
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
I didn’t have a watch or my phone	Nnali sirina ssaawa wadde essimu yange
My friend told me he was in town	Mukwano gwange yang’amba nti yali mu kibuga
Either way, it’s really good.	Mu ngeri yonna, ddala kirungi.
I have to earn my job	Nnina okufuna ku mulimu gwange
He didn’t want to do anything anyone else was doing.	Yali tayagala kukola kintu kyonna omuntu omulala yenna kye yali akola.
Every man does his job	Buli musajja akola omulimu gwe
No one knew he was leaving.	Tewali yali amanyi nti yali agenda.
It was a beautiful night.	Ekiro kyali kirungi nnyo.
I knew you would be you	Namanya nti ggwe ojja kuba ggwe
It’s not us.	Si ffe.
He was with me.	Yali nange.
I couldn’t see anything clearly	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna bulungi
I was curious about it	Nnali njagala nnyo okumanya ku nsonga eyo
I need the time.	Nze nneetaaga obudde.
You are a true friend.	Oli mukwano gwa ddala.
He is a very nice man.	Ye musajja mulungi nnyo.
It’s just the same for me.	Kye kimu kyokka gyendi.
But one other and .	Naye omulala omu ne .
But it won’t work.	Naye tekijja kukola.
He wasn’t thinking very clearly.	Yali talowooza bulungi nnyo.
I can’t do that, of course, but he could	Ekyo sisobola kukikola, ddala, naye ye yali asobola
Maybe it will be easier.	Mpozzi kijja kuba kyangu.
He had a feeling this would happen.	Yalina endowooza nti kino kijja kubaawo.
We should do this again, he said.	Kino tusaanidde okuddamu okukikola, bwe yagambye.
I had no idea how this could happen	Kino nnali simanyi ngeri gye kiyinza kubaawo
The issue is not the issue.	Ensonga si nsonga.
He knows best.	Asinga okumanya.
I want to help, he said	Njagala kuyamba, bwe yagambye
To see what it was like.	Okulaba engeri gye yali.
It’s very difficult for us.	Kizibu nnyo gye tuli.
There is no place to go.	Tewali kifo kya kugenda.
I don’t have anything to eat	Sirina kya kulya
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
I couldn’t really believe it.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza ddala.
I think it’s a good point.	Ndowooza nsonga nnungi.
Just like you wanted.	Nga bwe wali oyagala.
I only have one of my own	Nnina omu yekka ku nze
It will do it.	Kijja kukikola.
Both are his.	Bombi bali ye.
I don’t want to tell my dad about my problem	Saagala kubuulira taata ku kizibu kyange
And even when I was working.	Era ne bwe kyali nga nkola.
I thought tonight would be good for me	Nalowooza nti ekiro kino kyandibadde kirungi gyendi
But someone is going to do it.	Naye waliwo agenda okukikola.
For a long time.	Okumala ebbanga ddene.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
I loved seeing everyone	Nnali njagala nnyo okulaba buli muntu
Is that right?.	Ekyo kituufu?.
I need to know what’s going on	Nnina okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
And you’ll see everything that’s happening.	Era ojja kulaba buli kimu ekigenda mu maaso.
I knew it would be a child.	Namanya nti yandibadde mwana.
You don’t have to do it again.	Tolina kuddamu kukikola.
There is a point to this though.	Waliwo ensonga ku kino wadde.
I love my father.	Njagala taata wange.
He thought of his brother.	Yalowooza ku muganda we.
He is a good man.	Musajja mulungi.
There is no mention of it.	Tewali kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
We have to be here.	Tulina okubeera wano.
I was too watchful.	Nali nnyo okulaba.
I knew this was going to be really bad.	Namanya nti kino kyali kigenda kuba kibi ddala.
I’ll see what we can do	Nja kulaba kye tusobola okukola
I really, really, really like it	Njagala nnyo, nnyo, nnyo
I need to be alone for a while	Nze nneetaaga okubeera nzekka okumala akaseera
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
He often does it.	Atera okukikola.
That was a young child.	Oyo yali mwana muto.
He had to answer.	Yalina okuddamu.
You have been a blessing to me.	Obadde mukisa gyendi.
I knew it was true.	Namanya nti kituufu.
I need to get busy.	Nze nneetaaga okubeera bbize.
I don’t know what the reason is exactly.	Simanyi nsonga ki ddala.
So he came to the hospital.	Bwatyo yajja mu ddwaaliro.
But not everyone does.	Naye si buli muntu nti akola.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
You have it, too.	Naawe olina.
I know how hard it is	Nkimanyi engeri gye kizibu
Every day it seems.	Buli lunaku kirabika.
I want to be the one doing that	Njagala kubeera nze akola ekyo
But I hope he comes next week.	Naye nsuubira nti ajja kujja wiiki ejja.
I really need to get home	Nneetaaga nnyo okutuuka awaka
I hope you talk to me	Nsuubira okwogera nange
It’s in us.	Kiri mu ffe.
He doesn’t want to answer.	Tayagala kuddamu.
But he isn’t.	Naye si bw’atyo.
I can do that.	Ekyo nsobola okukikola.
I thought he was speechless at the time.	Nnali ndowooza nti yali tasobola kwogera mu kiseera ekyo.
He knew what he had to do.	Yali amanyi kye yalina okukola.
I couldn’t find one though.	Nali sisobola kufuna emu wadde.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
Almost everyone thought so.	Kumpi buli omu yalowooza bw’atyo.
I didn’t care about work.	Nnali sifaayo ku mulimu.
This was a good thing.	Kino kyali kintu kirungi.
He couldn’t see clearly.	Yali tasobola kulaba bulungi.
There, he thought.	Eyo, bwe yalowooza.
He knew he was real.	Yali akimanyi nti yali wa ddala.
You can say whatever you want.	Osobola okwogera kyonna ky’oyagala.
A little bit of it.	Katono ddala.
I was expecting someone else myself	Nze kennyini nnali nsuubira omuntu omulala
He wanted, very much, to talk to me.	Yali ayagala, nnyo, okwogera nange.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nnali simanyi kye kyali.
I have been working on this method for a long time	Nze nkola ku nkola eno okumala ebbanga
This is now happening.	Kino kati kigenda mu maaso.
There is no reason why.	Tewali nsonga lwaki...
I'm not quite sure why or how.	Sikakasa bulungi lwaki oba ngeri ki.
Not very well, but he was doing it.	Si bulungi nnyo, naye yali akikola.
I needed to be ready	Nnali nneetaaga okuba nga mwetegefu
I should have seen like you	Nnali nsaanidde okulaba nga ggwe
Maybe next weekend.	Mpozzi wiikendi ejja.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
This is a very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
But it’s very important to me.	Naye kikulu nnyo gyendi.
I won’t stay long.	Sijja kumala bbanga ddene.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
He wasn’t pretty in the face.	Yali si mulungi mu maaso.
I want to go do everything with you	Njagala kugenda kukola naawe buli kimu
That's what.	Ekyo kye ki...
I was sick.	Nnali mulwadde.
It was powerful.	Yali ya maanyi.
Either you are or you are not.	Oba oli oba toli.
There is nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna.
He was really very nice indeed.	Ddala yali mulungi nnyo ddala.
I can’t live with one person	Sisobola kubeera na muntu omu
I loved his image	Nnali njagala nnyo ekifaananyi kye
You can’t do that.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola.
You don’t have to win every issue.	Tolina kuwangula buli nsonga.
What he would do.	Kye yandikoze.
I just want to go home	Njagala kudda waka kyokka
I think he is telling the truth	Ndowooza ayogera mazima
We have to go,’ he said.	Tulina okugenda,’ bwe yagambye.
That is a huge risk.	Ekyo kya bulabe bwa maanyi nnyo.
It was very dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
You are better today than you were yesterday.	Oli mulungi leero okusinga bwe wali jjo.
No one was home at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo tewali yali waka.
I wanted to be that man	Nnali njagala kubeera musajja oyo
I was terrified of this.	Kino nnali ntya nnyo.
He really wanted that thing.	Ekintu ekyo yali ayagala nnyo.
I guess anyone can see that	Ntebereza omuntu yenna asobola okulaba ekyo
It’s a place.	Kye kifo.
This was a fact.	Kino kyali kituufu.
I didn’t know what to say.	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera.
I know he is with you	Nkimanyi nti ali naawe
And that’s not always easy.	Era ekyo si kyangu bulijjo.
He would have been very happy.	Yandibadde musanyufu nnyo.
And that’s in anything.	Era ekyo kiri mu kintu kyonna.
I want to help.	Njagala kuyamba.
I was in the hospital myself	Nze kennyini nali mu ddwaaliro
I have to go home	Nnina okudda eka
I guess it’s one for everything	Ntebereza nti kimu ku buli kimu
I think that’s a problem	Ndowooza ekyo kizibu
I thought this would be easy	Nalowooza nti kino kyandibadde kyangu
I can only think of one thing	Nsobola okulowooza ku kintu kimu kyokka
I have been working really hard	Mbadde nkola nnyo ddala
I know not everyone can do this	Nkimanyi si buli muntu nti asobola okukola kino
It’s not hard to do.	Si kizibu kukola.
I think everyone knows what they are.	Ndowooza buli muntu amanyi kye bali.
And maybe that’s a good thing.	Era mpozzi ekyo kintu kirungi.
Surely, he would.	Mazima ddala, yandibadde.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
It’s not hard to believe.	Si kizibu kukkiriza.
However, it is not me.	Kyokka si nze.
I'll try it.	Nja kugezaako.
But that's the point.	Naye eyo y'ensonga.
And yet, and yet.	Era naye, era naye.
But not you and you alone.	Naye si ggwe naawe wekka.
I want to do it myself.	Njagala kukikola nze kennyini.
Now it’s just going to do it.	Kati kigenda kukikola kyokka.
I really hope you might as well	Nsuubira ddala nti oyinza nga bwe kiri
It was that thing.	Kyali kintu ekyo.
I knew it would come.	Namanya nti kijja kujja.
And yet it is.	Era naye bwe kiri.
Now, he couldn't do that.	Kati, ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
I think it’s time to move on	Ndowooza kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso
He was pretty good at that.	Yali mulungi nnyo ku ekyo.
That’s what’s going on.	Ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso.
I didn’t know where he lived	Nnali simanyi gye yali abeera
I think he needs a friend.	Ndowooza yeetaaga mukwano gwe.
I want to know as well.	Nze nange njagala okumanya nga naawe.
I don’t want to come back here again.	Saagala kuddamu kudda wano.
I have to speak very openly	Nnina okwogera mu lwatu nnyo
He's a nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi.
Everything looks good.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi.
I have to talk about it.	Nnina okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
I can’t believe this	Kino siyinza kukkiriza
I can’t go back down there	Sisobola kudda wansi awo
Although it is the case.	Wadde nga bwe kiri.
I want to go home now please	Njagala kudda waka kati nsaba
That’s in a way.	Ekyo kiri mu ngeri.
I knew it was probably nothing	Namanya nti osanga si kintu kyonna
We have a plan.	Tulina enteekateeka.
I needed to talk to my father	Nnali nneetaaga okwogera ne taata
It’s really nice.	Kirungi ddala.
I really need to talk to him.	Mazima ddala nneetaaga okwogera naye.
I didn’t want that for him	Ekyo nnali saagala ku ye
I know you have to	Nkimanyi nti olina okukikola
This will be very difficult.	Kino kijja kuba kizibu nnyo.
I was very young at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali muto nnyo
I didn’t think he would.	Nnali sirowooza nti ajja kukikola.
I don’t need anything	Sirina kye nneetaaga
I didn’t have time to see much of the sight	Nnali sirina budde bwa kulaba nnyo kulaba
I can’t go on	Sisobola kugenda mu maaso
I was wondering this myself	Kino nze kennyini nnali nneebuuza
It certainly isn’t.	Mazima ddala si kye kiri.
He knew what he had to do.	Yali amanyi kye yalina okukola.
I need to know if this is true	Nnina okumanya oba kino kituufu
Or you won’t do it.	Oba tojja kukikola.
That was all anyone knew.	Ekyo kyokka omuntu yenna kye yali amanyi.
And he really wants to.	Era ddala ayagala.
Everyone has one.	Buli muntu alina emu.
He wants to be with me all the time now.	Ayagala kubeera nange buli kiseera kati.
I hope you love it.	Nsuubira nti oyagala nnyo.
However, he was in good shape.	Kyokka, yali mu mbeera nnungi.
Maybe he was asleep	Mpozzi nga yeebase
I wish she was here now.	Njagala yandibadde wano kati.
I think that’s all we need	Ndowooza ekyo kyokka kye twetaaga
Now I can’t do it	Kati sisobola kukikola
Certainly not in mine.	Mazima ddala si mu yange.
I don’t have anything like that	Nze sirina kintu nga ekyo
I never want to be alone again	Saagala kuddamu kubeera yekka
I hope this is going to work well	Nsuubira nti kino kigenda kukola bulungi
I know it, already.	Nze nkimanyi, dda.
However, he was thinking.	Kyokka yali alowooza.
What do you think.	Ggwe olowooza ki.
And there are many reasons why.	Era waliwo ensonga nnyingi lwaki.
It’s the only place we can go.	Kye kifo kyokka we tusobola okugenda.
It is certainly true.	Mazima ddala kituufu.
He was thinking quickly.	Yali alowooza mangu.
I don’t want to go down	Saagala kugenda wansi
This is nothing.	Kino si kintu kyonna.
I'll do it tomorrow.	Nja kukikola enkya.
He was very good to me.	Yali mulungi nnyo gyendi.
I guess it’s time to go	Ntebereza nti kye kiseera okugenda
That’s what he wanted.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala.
And he is the only one.	Era ye yekka.
I don’t think this is true	Kino sirowooza nti kituufu
We have nothing now.	Tetulina kye tulina kati.
Probably not much.	Oboolyawo si bingi.
You always wanted to do that.	Bulijjo wali oyagala okukola ekyo.
You have to work with us.	Olina okukola naffe.
Probably not much.	Oboolyawo si bingi.
He said he needed a friend.	Yagambye nti yeetaaga mukwano gwe.
They were beneath me.	Baali wansi wange.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Era si kibi.
We will discuss each of these in turn.	Tujja kwogera ku buli kimu ku bino mu kuddamu.
As if that is the point.	Nga bwe kiri nti eyo y’ensonga.
I wasn’t sure about any of this	Nze nali sikakasa ku kintu kyonna ku bino
I wanted them both there	Nnali njagala bombi eyo
This is important to them.	Kino kikulu gye bali.
You want money.	Oyagala ssente.
I want to be doing things	Njagala kubeera nga nkola ebintu
I don’t want to be good either.	Nange saagala kubeera mulungi.
I won’t say anything	Sijja kwogera kintu kyonna
I knew it would happen again.	Namanya nti kijja kuddamu okubaawo.
I can't work.	Sisobola kukola.
I hope you have it.	Nsuubira nti olina.
I didn’t think he would	Nnali sirowooza nti ajja kukikola
He is very well.	Ali bulungi nnyo.
He was a pretty good guy about it.	Yali ggaayi mulungi nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
I know it will be hard	Nkimanyi nti kijja kuba kizibu
But also nothing.	Naye era nga tewali kintu kyonna.
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
It might just be me.	Ayinza okuba nga nze nzekka.
I think we should just be friends	Ndowooza tusaanidde kumala kubeera ba mukwano
Take a picture of me.	Kuba ekifaananyi kyange.
I was making money.	Nnali nkola ssente.
. . . .	.
I could barely speak.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kwogera.
But he was in a hurry.	Naye yali mu bwangu.
And he's not here.	Era tali wano.
He thought he could do it.	Yalowooza nti yali asobola okukikola.
He didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala.
It was much more complicated than that.	Kyali kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He's not there.	Tali awo.
I feel like myself.	Nze mpulira nga nze kennyini.
That is not true today.	Ekyo si kituufu leero.
I didn’t want to at all	Nnali saagala n’akatono
I hoped that wouldn’t happen	Nnali nsuubira nti ekyo tekijja kubaawo
I feel so much faster and stronger.	Mpulira nnyo nga ndi mangu era nga ndi wa maanyi.
I already knew where he lived	Namanya dda gye yali abeera
And it will happen.	Era kijja kubaawo.
I love the facts too.	Nze nange njagala nnyo ensonga.
I expected it to happen	Nali nsuubira nti kijja kubaawo
It wasn’t something he really wanted to do too much.	Si kintu kye yali ayagala ennyo okukola ennyo.
Talking to you.	Okwogera naawe.
However, I can’t.	Kyokka sisobola.
I know this is unusual	Nkimanyi nti kino si kya bulijjo
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
I wonder if anyone really can	Nze nneebuuza oba ddala waliwo omuntu yenna asobola
I couldn’t tell what he was thinking.	Nnali sisobola kwogera kye yali alowooza.
But it’s not me.	Naye si nze.
That is certainly what is happening now.	Mazima ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso kati.
This is difficult to do.	Kino kizibu okukola.
You can be a person.	Oyinza okuba omuntu.
We have to go.	Tulina okugenda.
As always, probably.	Nga bwe kyali bulijjo, oboolyawo.
He was a real person.	Yali muntu ddala.
I didn’t think it would work.	Nnali sirowooza nti kijja kukola.
I am not alone in this at all	Kino siri nzekka n’akatono
You should do the same thing.	Naawe wandibadde okola ekintu kye kimu.
Easier said than done.	Kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
In the sky.	Mu bbanga.
I feel we will be very busy	Mpulira tujja kuba bbize nnyo
I know it for a reason	Nze nkimanyi lwa nsonga
I want to be a good person	Njagala kubeera muntu mulungi
I don’t want to work on one	Saagala kukola ku emu
My father couldn’t be here alone.	Taata yali tasobola kubeera wano yekka.
I knew something was going on here	Namanya nti wano waliwo ekigenda mu maaso
I didn’t even care what they were	Nali sifaayo wadde ku kiki kye baali
And that is very important.	Era ekyo kikulu nnyo.
I don’t know what it is.	Simanyi kye kiri.
No one was talking about me.	Tewali yali ayogera ku nze.
I certainly had no friends	Mazima ddala nnali sirina mikwano
I think about everything.	Ndowooza ku buli kimu.
But you’re in luck.	Naye ggwe oli mu mukisa.
I still can’t believe it.	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kukkiriza.
He says as it is.	Agamba nga bwe kiri.
What do you think?.	Ggwe olowooza ki?.
He wasn't going to be doing this.	Kino yali tagenda kuba agenda kukola.
I was actually feeling it	Mu butuufu nnali mpulira
It’s not the same time.	Si kye kiseera kye kimu.
Not really very good, but really bad.	Si ddala kirungi nnyo, naye ddala kibi nnyo.
I was ready.	Nnali mwetegefu.
However, this is not very important.	Kyokka kino si kikulu nnyo.
He couldn’t get enough.	Yali tasobola kufuna kumala.
I guess he lives there	Ntebereza nti abeera eyo
He should have been here.	Yandibadde wano.
I am in a lucky position	Ndi mu mbeera ya mukisa
That was his plan.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka ye.
Pretty good, actually.	Kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
He worked hard.	Yakola nnyo.
It started from the bottom and now we here.	Yatandika okuva wansi kati ffe wano.
There is a problem.	Waliwo obuzibu.
I wasn’t ready to do anything like that	Nnali siri mwetegefu kukola kintu kyonna nga ekyo
You know this is true.	Omanyi kino kituufu.
I know how important it is to you	Nkimanyi nti kikulu nnyo gy’oli
I feel scared.	Mpulira nga ntya.
I think now is a good time	Ndowooza kati kiseera kirungi
Nothing unusual about that.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo ku ekyo.
Perhaps that might work.	Oboolyawo ekyo kiyinza okukola.
I’m not doing anything.	Nze sirina kye nkola.
a.	omu.
Now I know this is true	Kati nkimanyi nti kino kituufu
But only one problem.	Naye ekizibu kimu kyokka.
Probably not something you always want to do.	Oboolyawo si kintu ky’oyagala okukola bulijjo.
But, that was it.	Naye, ekyo kye kyali.
That we need help.	Nti twetaaga obuyambi.
It’s probably a complicated problem.	Oboolyawo kizibu kizibu.
Hungry very very hungry.	Enjala enjala nnyo nnyo.
However, I don’t think we should do this	Kyokka sirowooza nti kino tusaanidde kukikola
I do very well at home	Nkola bulungi nnyo awaka
I didn’t want to deal with that	Ekyo nnali saagala kukola ku nsonga eyo
I’m not ready for that.	Ekyo siri mwetegefu.
And he didn't want to talk about it.	Era yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
I knew we were in trouble at the time	Namanya nti mu kiseera ekyo twali mu buzibu
I want to know where they are	Njagala kumanya gye bali
I was very into the guy.	Nali nnyo mu ggaayi.
Now he knew.	Kati yali amanyi.
He started very young.	Yatandika nga muto nnyo.
I'll be back soon	Nja kudda mangu
A long time.	Ebbanga ddene.
This was excellent.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
This is a good idea but not accurate.	Kino kirowoozo kirungi naye si kituufu.
I think he wanted the same for me	Ndowooza naye yali ayagala kye kimu gyendi
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
I thought, this would be a good place to be	Nalowooza nti, kino kyandibadde kifo kirungi okubeera
Certainly there is.	Mazima ddala waliwo.
No one knows what time.	Tewali amanyi ssaawa mmeka.
In a room, like this one.	Mu kisenge, nga kino.
You can do that.	Ekyo osobola okukikola.
I guess that’s what this place is	Ntebereza nti ekyo kye kifo kino kye kiri
That was good for me.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
That would be, you know, very powerful.	Ekyo kyandibadde, omanyi, kya maanyi nnyo.
I hope he was good	Nsuubira nti yali mulungi
He must have started.	Ateekwa okuba nga yatandika.
I knew what was going on.	Namanya ekigenda mu maaso.
It feels so good to be here	Mpulira bulungi nnyo okubeera wano
However, we will be fine.	Kyokka, tujja kuba bulungi.
I guess they are not	Ntebereza nti si bwe bali
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
But now it’s really easy.	Naye kati kyangu ddala.
You’re not going to win.	Togenda kuwangula.
But not all of it.	Naye si byonna.
I'll have to think about it	Nja kuba nnina okulowooza ku nsonga eno
If you could find those, you could be a person yourself.	Singa osobola okufuna ebyo, oyinza okuba omuntu ggwe kennyini.
I was so excited	Nnali musanyufu nnyo
Now, of course, everyone seems to have one.	Kati, kya lwatu, buli muntu alabika alina emu.
He really didn't want to talk about it now.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eno kati.
Good.	Kirungi.
I honestly can’t answer why either	Mu butuufu nange sisobola kuddamu lwaki
He’s been busy.	Abadde bbize.
Or your phone.	Oba essimu yo.
He has to do his job.	Alina okukola omulimu gwe.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
It was that guy.	Yali ggaayi oyo.
This was a very important step.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
There is no answer.	Tewali kuddamu.
You know in the.	Omanyi mu.
I don’t want to know the truth myself.	Nze kennyini saagala kumanya mazima.
It is very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo.
I’m not sure what he did when we left	Sikakasa kye yakola nga tugenda
Really bad, actually.	Ddala kibi, mu butuufu.
We will find out why he did this.	Tugenda kumanya lwaki yakola kino.
He didn’t know where or how to do it.	Yali tamanyi wa oba ngeri ya kukikola.
I didn’t know what job I had to do	Nnali simanyi mulimu gwe nnina okukola
I had no idea until today	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi okutuusa leero
The bottom is the same.	Wansi kye kimu.
I have a problem here	Nnina ekizibu wano
There was nothing he could do about it.	Tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eyo.
I have no idea what his thinking is	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ndowooza ye
Not bad.	Si kibi.
He could clearly see his wife.	Yali asobola okulaba bulungi mukyala we.
I already know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi dda.
I was wondering if anyone here could help	Nali nneebuuza oba waliwo omuntu yenna wano asobola okuyamba
I think he felt comfortable with me	Ndowooza yawulira bulungi nange
This is what it is.	Kino kye kiri.
I could do anything.	Nnali nsobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
I could see much better now	Nnali nsobola okulaba obulungi ennyo kati
That’s what he would do.	Ekyo kye yandikoze.
I have to tell everyone.	Nnina okubuulira buli muntu.
He makes plans.	Akola enteekateeka.
Here they are!.	Wano we bali!.
In any way really.	Mu ngeri yonna ddala.
I am definitely not a morning person	Mazima ddala siri muntu wa makya
I’ve always been very local	Bulijjo ndi wa wano nnyo
He could only think of the man.	Yali asobola okulowooza ku musajja oyo yekka.
I’ll be fine soon, she told me	Nja kuba bulungi mu bbanga ttono, bwe yang’amba
It’s a good idea.	Kirowoozo kirungi.
I wanted to be happy	Nnali njagala kubeera musanyufu
I was pretty sure you would	Nali nkakasa bulungi nti ojja kukikola
The thing is that.	Ekintu kiri nti.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
However, that will do.	Kyokka, ekyo kijja kukola.
This will not convince anyone.	Kino tekijja kukkiriza muntu yenna.
I think that’s a very good point	Ndowooza eyo nsonga nnungi nnyo
I can’t get enough of you.	Sisobola kumala kubeera naawe.
That was good to know that.	Ekyo kyali kirungi okumanya ekyo.
You can do anything.	Osobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
We’re going to talk.	Tugenda kwogera.
He always needed money	Bulijjo yali yeetaaga ssente
That can probably only happen to one person, though.	Ekyo oboolyawo kiyinza okubaawo ku muntu omu yekka, naye.
I’m sick of you.	Nze ndi mulwadde gy’oli.
I was with him.	Nze nnali naye.
But you can help.	Naye ggwe asobola okuyamba.
Everyone is a guy.	Buli muntu yenna.
But he was the one.	Naye ye yali.
I may have had it.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnina.
I didn’t know what you were going to say	Nnali simanyi kye wali ogenda kwogera
I hoped it would work	Nali nsuubira nti kijja kukola
He is very happy.	Musanyufu nnyo.
That’s what it is.	Kye kiri.
But but .	Naye naye .
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
I feel so sick actually	Mpulira nga ndi mulwadde nnyo mu butuufu
Except for the .	Okuggyako .
Maybe he’s a friend.	Mpozzi nga wa mukwano.
It was worse than that.	Kyali kibi okusinga ekyo.
And she felt good too, really good.	Era naye yawulira bulungi, ddala bulungi.
It’s not a person.	Si muntu.
I don’t know the answer myself.	Nze kennyini simanyi kya kuddamu.
I feel very lucky too	Nange mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa nnyo
I am not a morning person	Siri muntu wa makya
How do you do it?.	Okola otya?.
I had nothing to fear	Nnali sirina kye nnali ntya
What was that.	Ekyo kyali ki.
This is just a placeholder now.	Kino kifo kya kifo kyokka kati.
Not young, either, that one.	Si muto, era, oyo.
It’s a lot of money, but this is important.	Ssente nnyingi naye kino kikulu.
There is no time.	Tewali budde.
I certainly hope not you.	Mazima ddala nsuubira nti si ggwe.
I won’t tell anyone though	Sijja kubuulira muntu yenna wadde
I couldn’t believe it was me	Nali sisobola kukkiriza nti nze
That’s the guy we need.	Oyo ye ggaayi gwe twetaaga.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
I am a doctor.	Nze ndi musawo.
He just had to go. 	Yalina okugenda kyokka. 
it was really, really good.	kyali kirungi ddala, ddala.
Nothing is more important right now.	Tewali kikulu okusinga ekyo mu kiseera kino.
I needed to know	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
With a dog.	Nga waliwo embwa.
I thought that would be me.	Nalowooza nti oyo yandibadde nze.
I guess that’s not too bad	Ntebereza nti ekyo si kibi nnyo
I know he plans to	Nkimanyi nti ateekateeka okukikola
No, this week was too fast.	Nedda, wiiki eno yali ya mangu nnyo.
And my brother.	Ne muganda wange.
No real work, no real work.	Tewali mulimu gwa ddala, tewali mulimu gwa ddala.
I am in a lot of trouble.	Ndi mu buzibu bungi.
I’ve always loved it	Bulijjo mbadde njagala nnyo
I want to play too.	Nange njagala kuzannya.
But there is a problem.	Naye waliwo ekizibu.
I was a young child.	Nnali mwana muto.
It’s just a sin.	Kibi kyokka.
He can’t do this.	Kino tasobola kukikola.
I was the only young one.	Nze nnali muto nzekka.
I’ll be here tomorrow	Nja kubeera wano enkya
He spoke for a while.	Yayogera okumala akaseera.
I have to leave the house now	Nnina okuva mu nnyumba kati
He didn’t want to do it.	Yali tayagala kukikola.
And he is in this movie.	Era ali mu firimu eno.
I hesitate to talk to him	Nneebuuza okwogera naye
I would love to talk to you	Njagala nnyo okwogera naawe
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
I won’t be an hour too long	Sijja kuba ssaawa emu nnyo
Perhaps he had a point.	Oboolyawo yalina ensonga.
What for, of course.	Kiki ku lwa, ddala.
And he was very good.	Era yali mulungi nnyo.
I think it will be great	Ndowooza kijja kuba kirungi nnyo
I knew what he was thinking	Nnali mmanyi kye yali alowooza
I knew it would happen, though	Nali nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo, naye
I will never do it again.	Sijja kuddamu kukikola.
This week will be good.	Wiiki eno ejja kuba nnungi.
To move forward.	Okugenda mu maaso.
I don’t have a job.	Nze sirina mulimu.
He had nothing of the sort.	Yali talina kintu kyonna kya ngeri eyo.
I love money.	Njagala nnyo ssente.
Today, however, I was a little nervous	Kyokka leero nnali ntya katono
He speaks to himself.	Ayogera yekka.
I’ve always loved it.	Bulijjo mbadde njagala nnyo.
But there is nothing.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna.
And he had it.	Era yalina.
I know what he needs	Nze mmanyi kye yeetaaga
That you.	Nti ggwe.
I can’t go anymore.	Sisobola kuddamu kugenda.
I really had no idea	Mu butuufu nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna
I don’t know why.	Simanyi lwaki.
This might work.	Kino kiyinza okukola.
I wonder what that was	Nneebuuza ekyo kye kyali
And you will come here every day.	Era buli lunaku ojja kujja wano.
There, he said.	Eyo, bwe yagambye.
In fact they are not.	Mu butuufu si bwe bali.
I don’t know where he went.	Simanyi gye yagenda.
You're not with me.	Toli nange.
I think we’ll be fine here for a while	Ndowooza wano tujja kuba bulungi okumala akaseera
You are his brother.	Ggwe muganda we.
I love it on every day	Njagala nnyo ku buli lunaku
That’s what you wanted.	Ekyo kye wali oyagala.
I don’t know if that’s good or bad.	Simanyi oba ekyo kirungi oba kibi.
I didn’t know he was coming.	Nali simanyi nti ajja.
I couldn’t do it	Nnali sisobola kukikola
He wanted, perhaps, to do many things.	Yali ayagala, mpozzi, okukola ebintu bingi.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
I’m fine with that.	Nze ndi bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
I won’t be without any problems	Sijja kuba tewali buzibu bwonna
I knew he wasn’t in a very good place	Namanya nti tali mu kifo kirungi nnyo
He liked to talk about money, obviously.	Yali ayagala nnyo okwogera ku ssente, nga kirabika.
Everything seems to be there.	Buli kimu kirabika kiri awo.
But now he speaks.	Naye kati ayogera.
That seems like.	Ekyo kirabika nga...
He was a guy’s guy.	Yali ggaayi wa ggaayi.
I need help with this one.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi ku eno.
I will never be the same again	Sijja kuddamu kubeera nga bwe yali
I’m sure you really know this.	Nkakasa nti ddala kino okimanyi.
I thought he was very lucky	Nalowooza nti wa mukisa nnyo
All very quickly.	Byonna mu bwangu nnyo.
I guess she looks great	Ntebereza nti alabika bulungi nnyo
I didn’t know what to say.	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera.
I didn’t have to do it.	Nnali sirina kukikola.
He is at home.	Ali waka.
I’m not going to do that again	Ekyo sigenda kuddamu kukikola
That’s not the focus right now.	Ekyo si kye kikulu mu kiseera kino.
But that is not the case at all.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
Maybe it’s not good.	Mpozzi nga si kirungi.
But we’ll be down for a little while longer.	Naye tujja kuba wansi okumala akaseera katono.
However, it is not so easy.	Kyokka, si kyangu nnyo.
I thought, we have to get out of this.	Nalowooza, tulina okuva mu kino.
But he was friendly to everyone.	Naye yali wa mukwano eri buli muntu.
And we have no choice.	Era tetulina kya kukola ku nsonga eyo.
It was a normal thing.	Kyali kintu kya bulijjo.
I guess it’s safe.	Ntebereza nti tewali bulabe.
He leaves immediately.	Agenda amangu ddala.
I’m not going to be down for that at all.	Ekyo sigenda kubeera wansi n’akatono.
He loved his wife.	Yali ayagala nnyo mukyala we.
The problem is complicated.	Ekizibu kizibu.
The way he was.	Engeri gye yali.
I am behind it all	Nze ali emabega wa byonna
I love no one but you	Nze sirina muntu yenna gwe njagala okuggyako ggwe
You are not his doctor.	Ggwe toli musawo we.
And it is very dangerous.	Era kya bulabe nnyo.
Looks like he'll be fine.	Kirabika ajja kuba bulungi.
I didn’t know where we were	Nnali simanyi gye twali
We will do it.	Tujja kukikola.
That was a good point	Eyo yali nsonga nnungi
It wasn’t him.	Si ye yali.
You can’t actually do it.	Mu butuufu tosobola kukikola.
I am here now.	Nze ndi wano kati.
I thought it was normal	Nalowooza nti kyali kya bulijjo
I just know how they are	Nze mmanyi kyokka bwe bali
I knew they were.	Nali nkimanyi nti bwe bali.
He will go here and there.	Ajja kugenda wano ne wali.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
I knew better than that	Nze nnali mmanyi okusinga ekyo
No money at all.	Tewali ssente n’akatono.
The thing is, it won’t happen.	Ekintu kiri nti, tekijja kubaawo.
But no one said anything.	Naye tewali yayogera kintu kyonna.
Nothing is normal.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo.
I wasn’t willing to do that before	Ekyo nnali siri mwetegefu kukikola emabegako
He speaks the truth.	Ayogera mazima.
My father is there.	Taata ali awo.
Whatever he lived in now.	Kyonna gye yali abeera kati.
I said no way.	Nagamba nti tewali ngeri yonna.
We can’t help this.	Kino tetusobola kuyamba.
You don’t have to do this.	Kino tolina kukikola.
I plan to be there too.	Nteekateeka kubeerawo nange.
I was alone.	Nnali nzekka.
He was the best.	Ye yali asinga obulungi.
I was ready to be a father	Nnali mwetegefu okubeera taata
I hoped he wouldn’t talk to me.	Nali nsuubira nti yali tajja kwogera nange.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
Everyone was nice.	Buli omu yali mulungi.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
I really thought he was a good person	Mazima ddala nnalowooza nti yali muntu mulungi
You’ll do it.	Ojja kukola.
He had to make a phone call.	Yalina okukuba essimu.
He couldn’t believe this was happening.	Yali tayinza kukkiriza nti kino kyali kigenda mu maaso.
I really wanted to help	Nnali njagala nnyo okuyamba
I really wanted to go	Nnali njagala nnyo okugenda
Just going backwards.	Okudda emabega kyokka.
How he loved it.	Engeri gye yali ayagala ennyo.
What are you doing.	Ggwe okola ki.
I didn’t want to see	Nnali saagala kulaba
Nothing was a problem.	Tewali kyali kizibu.
This is really happening.	Kino ddala kigenda mu maaso.
I hope he will be there this morning	Nsuubira nti enkya ya leero ajja kubeerawo
And, of course, at night.	Era, ddala, ekiro.
I really thought he was a nice guy	Ddala nnalowooza nti yali ggaayi mulungi
I can do that.	Ekyo nsobola okukikola.
I'm thinking ahead here.	Nze ndowooza mu maaso wano.
That was very important now.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo kati.
I had no issues	Nnali sirina nsonga yonna
That’s not really true.	Ekyo mu butuufu si kituufu.
I really have to be going	Nze ddala nnina okuba nga ngenda
I'll go ahead though	Nja kugenda mu maaso wadde
Today almost everyone has their own car.	Leero kumpi buli muntu alina mmotoka ye.
I need to talk to you	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe
No one knows what’s going on.	Tewali amanyi kigenda mu maaso.
I guess he’s not the only one	Ntebereza nti si ye yekka
He started the whole thing.	Yatandika ekintu kyonna.
I don’t know which one is better.	Simanyi ki asinga.
He has been unable to work.	Abadde tasobola kukola.
I doubt he slept at all	Nbuusabuusa nti yeebase n’akatono
I was here to go home	Nze nali wano kudda waka
I'll see if he's in.	Nja kulaba oba ali mu.
I was hoping you had	Nali nsuubira nti olina
I am, and that’s real	Nze ndi, era ekyo kya ddala
I love being with you	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe
But, the picture is not the same today.	Naye, ekifaananyi si kye kimu leero.
He said nothing immediately.	Tewali kye yayogera mu bwangu.
I have no idea what it would be.	Sirina kye mmanyi kye kyandibadde.
I have a lot to say	Nnina bingi bye njagala okwogera
And there we have it.	Era eyo gye tulina.
I can just eat.	Nsobola okulya kyokka.
Not because of what anyone else did.	Si lwa ekyo omuntu omulala yenna kye yakola.
We will get the job done.	Tujja kukola omulimu.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I honestly can’t speak now	Mu butuufu sisobola kwogera kati
That can be a challenge.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
That’s really important today.	Ekyo ddala kikulu nnyo leero.
I couldn’t talk about it	Nnali sisobola kwogera ku nsonga eno
All or nothing here.	Byonna oba tewali kintu kyonna wano.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
We have to eat.	Tulina okulya.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
I can feel something behind me, now	Nze mpulira ekintu emabega wange, kati
I want it here right now	Njagala wano mu kiseera kino
I thought he had for a while	Nalowooza nti yalina okumala akaseera
Immediately and in him not even immediately.	Amangu ddala era mu ye si wadde amangu ddala.
But he is very good.	Naye mulungi nnyo.
But it’s true.	Naye kituufu.
I want not what I want.	Nze njagala si kye njagala.
He has been.	Abadde...
That was exactly what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali ddala.
But that's the reason to talk.	Naye eyo y'ensonga lwaki okwogera.
I knew he was with us	Namanya nti yali naffe
I am very, very, very sorry	Nsonyiwa nnyo nnyo nnyo
But, it is the time.	Naye, kye kiseera.
He was behind her.	Yali emabega we.
I have only one problem with him	Nnina ekizibu kimu kyokka naye
We have the whole house to ourselves.	Ennyumba yonna tulina eri ffekka.
I was actually with him.	Mu butuufu nnali naye.
But that’s not everything.	Naye ekyo si kye buli kimu.
He was fast asleep.	Yali yeebase nnyo.
But he was a man.	Naye yali musajja.
My father had it.	Taata yalina.
I could do that	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola
I wonder if anyone can help	Nze nneebuuza oba waliwo asobola okuyamba
I will certainly do it for you	Mazima ddala nja kukikola gy’oli
I thought the same as you	Nalowooza kye kimu nga ggwe
I was hoping it would be my brother, but you will	Nali nsuubira nti yandibadde muganda wange naye ojja kukola
If, if, if.	Singa, singa, singa.
Here's where it goes.	Wano we kigenda.
I couldn’t believe it	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza
Both are fine.	Bombi bali bulungi.
It will work fine.	Kijja kukola bulungi.
It can be very difficult.	Kiyinza okuba nga kizibu nnyo.
Everything.	Buli kimu.
Now I had next to no time	Kati nnali sirina budde kumpi
It can happen to anyone.	Kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna.
I thought he was doing well	Nalowooza nti yali akola bulungi
And that is certainly the point.	Era mazima ddala eyo y’ensonga.
He says it is very important.	Agamba nti kikulu nnyo.
He always seems to know everyone.	Bulijjo alabika amanyi buli muntu.
I thought it was human	Nalowooza nti muntu
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tayinza kukkiriza nti kituufu.
He was asleep at the time.	Yali yeebase mu kiseera ekyo.
That's why you're here.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki oli wano.
But it certainly isn’t.	Naye mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
I couldn’t go back to my room by myself	Nnali sisobola kudda mu kisenge kyange nzekka
I can’t go back to that house	Sisobola kudda mu nnyumba eyo
He admitted he had a point.	Yakkiriza nti alina ensonga.
That is a very simple thing.	Ekyo kintu kyangu nnyo.
He needed a job.	Yali yeetaaga omulimu.
He was such a nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi bwatyo.
It’s not easy being me.	Si kyangu kubeera nze.
We have to talk.	Tulina okwogera.
I’m not the only one who does this.	Si nze nzekka akola kino.
I needed Dad more than anything.	Taata nnali nneetaaga nnyo okusinga ekintu kyonna.
I thought he wouldn’t talk to me	Nalowooza nti tajja kwogera nange
Which is not the case.	Kye si bwe kiri.
I love being with him	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye
I want to work on that	Njagala kukola ku ekyo
He was like a father to both of us.	Yali nga taata gye tuli ffembi.
I’m not ready.	Nze siri mwetegefu.
I can’t wait for my turn	Siyinza kulinda ssaawa yange
All I needed, now	Byonna nnali nneetaaga, kati
I don’t want a man.	Saagala musajja.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
Now you are here, in my house.	Kati oli wano, mu nnyumba yange.
He doesn’t want to go anywhere or do anything.	Tayagala kugenda yonna oba okukola ekintu kyonna.
He was as strong as he had ever been.	Yali wa maanyi nga bwe yali abadde.
I urge everyone to do the same	Nsaba buli muntu okukola kye kimu
That’s the point, of course.	Eyo y’ensonga, ddala.
On the house.	Ku nnyumba.
I couldn’t do anything	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
Not much though.	Si bingi wadde.
All these things.	Ebintu bino byonna.
That was certainly powerful	Ekyo mazima ddala kyali kya maanyi nnyo
I really like those.	Njagala nnyo ebyo.
I don’t know what to do about it.	Simanyi kya kukikola.
It was very powerful	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo
It doesn’t really matter to you.	Si kikulu nnyo gy’oli.
I was a young child.	Nnali mwana muto.
Or one of his friends.	Oba omu ku mikwano gye.
I just know it’s true	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti kituufu
He was real.	Yali wa ddala.
I was expecting this	Kino nnali nsuubira
But he went with his friends.	Naye yagenda ne mikwano gye.
Not actually doing anything.	Obutakola kintu kyonna mu butuufu.
I can do it.	Nnyinza okukikola.
What will happen, will happen.	Ekigenda okubaawo, kijja kubaawo.
I suppose that might be normal	Nsuubira nti ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kya bulijjo
He should have been here.	Yandibadde wano.
Not as faith.	Si nga kukkiriza.
Dad wants to go.	Taata ayagala kugenda.
I loved it at the time	Nnali njagala nnyo mu kiseera ekyo
I need to know you won’t do it again	Nnina okumanya nti tojja kuddamu kukikola
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
He wants to talk to us.	Ayagala okwogera naffe.
I love reading more than anything	Njagala nnyo okusoma okusinga ekintu kyonna
We need everyone to do this.	Kino okukikola twetaaga buli muntu.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
We were going to do it anyway	Twali tugenda kukikola mu ngeri yonna
He will always be with us	Ajja kubeera naffe bulijjo
But he's as good as anyone.	Naye mulungi nga omuntu yenna.
I have no idea where they are	Sirina kye mmanyi gye bali
I knew exactly what he would do	Nnali mmanyi bulungi kye yandikoze
It’s in my office at work.	Kiri mu ofiisi yange ku mulimu.
I was glad he was happy	Nnali musanyufu nti yali musanyufu
This will help the problem.	Kino kijja kuyamba ekizibu.
That was pretty close.	Ekyo kyali kya kumpi nnyo.
You are not a person.	Ggwe toli muntu.
I want to go home now	Njagala kudda waka kati
But together, we can do it.	Naye nga tuli wamu, tusobola okukikola.
It’s just true.	Kituufu kyokka.
In a sense this is true.	Mu ngeri emu kino kituufu.
I don’t think this was good.	Sirowooza nti kino kyali kirungi.
With or without it we will do much better.	Nga tulina oba nga tetulina tujja kukola bulungi nnyo.
I need to go away.	Nze nneetaaga okugenda.
But that’s it, just the two of us.	Naye ekyo kye kiri, ffembi ffekka.
In a way, this isn’t really a job.	Mu ngeri emu, guno mu butuufu si mulimu.
That was the whole point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga yonna.
That is exactly you.	Oyo gwe ddala ggwe.
I couldn’t really work out what it was	Nnali sisobola kukola ddala kye kyali
I wanted something about him	Nnali njagala ekintu ku ye
I want to be the same	Njagala kubeera kye kimu
It’s the time.	Kye kiseera.
I have to get out of there	Nnina okuva awo
He could hardly wait.	Yali tasobola bulungi kulinda.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
I think it’s too early to go back completely	Ndowooza nga bukyali nnyo okudda emabega ddala
Your whole plan, finished.	Enteekateeka yo yonna, ewedde.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
He was coming soon, so soon.	Yali ajja mangu, mangu nnyo.
I expected him to come at all	Nali nsuubira nti ajja kujja n’akatono
No, that wasn’t all he wanted to do.	Nedda, ekyo si kye kyokka kye yali ayagala okukola.
I was afraid of this	Kino nnali ntya
I will never do that again	Ekyo sijja kuddamu kukikola
I thought you were my brother, my best friend	Nalowooza nti oli muganda wange, mukwano gwange asinga
But it’s not the same thing.	Naye si kintu kye kimu.
I know that for a reason.	Ekyo nkimanyi lwa nsonga.
And that's where he is today.	Era awo w'ali leero.
I feel he is very good at his job.	Mpulira nti mulungi nnyo mu mulimu gwe.
I don’t even know if it matters.	Simanyi na oba kikulu.
I wasn’t going to jail	Nnali sigenda mu kkomera
' to '.	' ku '.
Beauty is a good thing	Obulungi kintu kirungi
He was trying to help.	Yali agezaako okuyamba.
I was too young for this	Kino nnali muto nnyo
He is a teacher.	Ye musomesa.
I just love it so much	Nze njagala nnyo kyokka
It doesn’t matter, obviously.	Si kikulu, kya lwatu.
Maybe something is going on behind her back.	Mpozzi nga waliwo ekigenda mu maaso emabega we.
He went on from there.	Yagenda mu maaso okuva awo.
Nothing is right.	Tewali kintu kyonna kituufu.
No one knew where he was.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yali.
I couldn’t do it again	Nnali sisobola kuddamu kukikola
I know what you really wanted	Nze mmanyi kye wali oyagala ddala
It’s hard to go.	Kizibu okugenda.
I knew he was close by now	Namanya nti kati yali kumpi awo
You don’t have to work as hard.	Tolina kukola nnyo nga bwe kiri.
But we have a problem.	Naye tulina ekizibu.
I wasn’t sure why but he felt he needed to	Nali sikakasa lwaki naye yawulira nga yeetaaga
I need to know he is okay	Nnina okumanya nti ali bulungi
You have to be all the time.	Olina okubeera buli kiseera.
You know that it is.	Omanyi nti bwe kiri.
But that is not uncommon.	Naye ekyo si kya bulijjo.
However, we cannot.	Kyokka, tetusobola.
You’re going to see a lot of that.	Ogenda kulaba bingi ku ebyo.
I couldn’t go home.	Nnali sisobola kudda waka.
I’m not going anywhere	Sirina gye ngenda
For him, that thing is a friend.	Ku ye, ekintu ekyo mukwano.
I think in the morning.	Ndowooza ku makya.
And you need to know better.	Era olina okumanya obulungi.
Maybe none of this would be good.	Mpozzi tewali na kimu ku bino kyandibadde kirungi.
I work very, very hard.	Nkola nnyo nnyo.
Like, really good.	Nga, ddala kirungi.
It seems bad to be.	Kirabika kibi okubeera.
I am the lowest of the low	Nze asinga wansi mu ba wansi
I can’t go back with him.	Siyinza kudda naye.
And it is the same.	Era bwe kiri.
I need to talk to you now	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe kati
As he should have been.	Nga bwe yandibadde.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
He was a dangerous guy	Yali ggaayi wa bulabe
That might work.	Ekyo kiyinza okukola.
And it’s not an easy thing.	Era si kintu kyangu.
I think that’s where we should go	Ndowooza awo we tusaanidde okugenda
I had no idea something was going on	Nnali simanyi nti waliwo ekigenda mu maaso
Now this is really bad.	Kati kino ddala kibi.
I just wanted to be alone	Nze nnali njagala kubeera nzekka
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
In this case, he got the help he needed.	Mu mbeera eno, yafuna obuyambi bwe yali yeetaaga.
I didn’t know how to live without my brother	Nali simanyi ngeri ya kubeera nga sirina muganda wange
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
We'll be back tomorrow.	Tujja kudda enkya.
I was in the hospital	Nali mu ddwaaliro
I’m almost speechless	Nze kumpi sisobola kwogera
Most probably he did.	Okusinga osanga yakikola.
I knew it would be coming	Namanya nti kijja kuba kijja
You don’t have time.	Tolina budde.
What we were.	Kye twali.
There is no money.	Tewali ssente.
Of course, that is a possibility.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo kiyinza okubaawo.
In my opinion.	Mu ndowooza yange.
I know you won’t do that	Nkimanyi nti ekyo tojja kukikola
I didn’t want to do it	Nnali saagala kukikola
It’s dangerous, of course.	Kya bulabe, ddala.
I’ve got a plan.	Nfunye enteekateeka.
I will do this.	Kino nja kukikola.
I can't believe he did this though	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kino yakikola wadde
I have to do eat	Nnina okukola okulya
What you want is what really matters.	Kye oyagala kye kikulu ennyo.
I was happy to be with him	Nnali musanyufu okubeera naye
But this will be hard to do.	Naye kino kijja kuba kizibu okukola.
Do we really need another one?.	Ddala twetaaga omulala?.
I’m not sure if it’s true	Sikakasa oba kituufu
I thought that was it	Nalowooza nti ekyo kye kyali
He was done with me.	Yali amaze nange.
I didn’t have time	Nnali sirina budde
I can do it better than you	Nsobola okukikola okusinga ggwe
There's no reason for you.	Tewali nsonga yonna gy'oli.
I thought you wanted to	Nalowooza nti oyagala
He had to get out of this.	Yalina okuva mu kino.
I will never answer again.	Sijja kuddamu kuddamu.
Maybe it’s too good.	Mpozzi kirungi nnyo.
We have to do the same again.	Naffe tulina okuddamu okukola kye kimu.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si bwe kiri kyokka.
But we’ll all have dinner together tonight.	Naye ffenna tujja kulya ffenna ekyeggulo ekiro kino.
It seems that	Kirabika nti .
I think that’s all it will be	Ndowooza ekyo kyokka kye kijja okuba
He said he was happy.	Yagambye nti musanyufu.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
So far you're doing a pretty good job with me.	N'okutuusa kati okola omulimu mulungi nnyo nange.
I thought he was pretty good	Nalowooza nti yali mulungi nnyo
I knew it wasn’t him	Namanya nti si ye
I guess he was doing that	Ntebereza nti ekyo yali akikola
I have one problem.	Nnina ekizibu kimu.
I thought, it’s time	Nalowooza nti, kye kiseera
He has also been at the police station.	Era abadde ku poliisi.
I feel better now, of course	Mpulira bulungi kati, ddala
I didn’t want anything.	Nnali sirina kye njagala.
I hope there are no problems	Nsuubira nti tewali buzibu bwonna
That would be a problem.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
I will do it again.	Nja kuddamu okukikola.
I didn’t know what it could do	Nnali simanyi kye kiyinza kukola
You are lucky to be here tonight.	Oli wa mukisa okubeera wano ekiro kino.
said the father.	Taata bwe yagamba.
I may have to do something about that	Ekyo nnyinza okuba nga nnina kye nnina okukola ku nsonga eyo
I said everything would be fine	Nagamba nti buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi
He was a human being.	Yali mwana wa muntu.
But it’s going to happen anyway.	Naye kigenda kubaawo mu ngeri yonna.
He is a good thing for me.	Ye kintu kirungi gyendi.
I was doing well	Nnali nkola bulungi
I have been here since yesterday	Mbadde wano okuva eggulo
I thought you’d want to know.	Nalowooza nti ojja kwagala okumanya.
I am very happy	Ndi musanyufu nnyo
You were here.	Ggwe wali wano.
But not quickly.	Naye si mangu.
I’m not him.	Nze siri ye.
It’s not like we were both.	Si nga bwe twali ffembi.
However, this is not entirely the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri ddala.
That's my opinion.	Eyo' endowooza yange.
This is a beautiful house.	Eno nnyumba nnungi.
Not his son.	Si mwana we.
But this is much more complicated than that.	Naye kino kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I can be ready to go tomorrow	Nsobola okuba nga ndi mwetegefu okugenda enkya
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
I already knew that	Ekyo nnali mmanyi dda
There is only you and me.	Waliwo nze naawe ffekka.
Although it was very important to me.	Wadde nga kyali kikulu nnyo gyendi.
We have to do better in this.	Tulina okukola obulungi mu kino.
I was ready for anything	Nnali mwetegefu okukola ku kintu kyonna
I needed one yesterday	Nnali nneetaaga emu jjo
He really fell asleep.	Ddala yeebase.
I wanted to know if you were okay	Nnali njagala kumanya oba oli bulungi
I’m pretty sure you know it too	Nkakasa bulungi nti naawe okimanyi
I wanted to do that.	Ekyo nnali njagala okukikola.
He thought about the other man for a moment.	Yalowooza ku musajja omulala okumala akaseera.
I can do it all.	Nsobola okukola byonna.
He is a very good teacher.	Musomesa mulungi nnyo.
In fact, it is the same problem.	Mu butuufu, kye kizibu kye kimu.
I always knew what to expect	Bulijjo nnali mmanyi kye nnali nsuubira
He seemed to be doing everything right.	Yalabika ng’akola buli kimu bulungi.
That’s a possibility.	Ekyo kiyinza okubaawo.
He could be good.	Yali asobola okuba omulungi.
But he is more than that.	Naye asinga ekyo.
For a week.	Okumala wiiki emu.
He is with us.	Ye wa naffe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Ye, ye, ye.
As he did now.	Nga bwe yakola kati.
He is completely asleep.	Yeebase ddala.
I just want to be in the here and now	Njagala kubeera mu wano ne kati kyokka
It doesn’t matter why.	Si kikulu lwaki.
I want to be human	Njagala kubeera muntu
And every place.	Ne buli kifo.
No, not that one.	Nedda, si oyo.
I thought it was a matter of love	Nalowooza nti nsonga ya kwagala
Of course, this is not unusual.	Kya lwatu nti kino si kya bulijjo.
Now, he is fine.	Kati, ali bulungi.
I know that’s a lot of money	Nkimanyi nti ebyo ssente nnyingi
He was in the moment.	Yali mu kiseera ekyo.
It is easy to see that this work is unusual.	Kyangu okulaba nti omulimu guno si gwa bulijjo.
But nothing will come.	Naye tewali kijja kujja.
You’re fine now.	Oli bulungi kati.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
But it is the same everywhere.	Naye buli wamu kye kimu.
I feel better now.	Mpulira bulungi kati.
I thought it might be awkward	Nalowooza nti kiyinza okuba ekintu ekizibu
I am fast and strong	Ndi wa mangu era wa maanyi
I can’t say who it was.	Siyinza kwogera ani yali.
Obviously that won’t happen, but that’s the reality.	Kya lwatu ekyo tekijja kubaawo, naye ekyo kye kituufu.
You have to do it yourself.	Olina okukikola ggwe kennyini.
I know nothing about this	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eno
I will not allow it to happen again	Sijja kukkiriza kuddamu kubaawo
I didn’t know what to say or do	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera oba kya kukola
You knew this.	Kino wali okimanyi.
I wasn’t going to say anything	Nze nali sigenda kwogera kintu kyonna
I wanted to be myself	Nnali njagala kubeera nze kennyini
That would be dangerous.	Ekyo kyandibadde kya bulabe.
Everyone is talking about it.	Buli omu ayogera ku nsonga eyo.
I don’t know exactly how long.	Simanyi bulungi bbanga ki.
It’s actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
It looks really good.	Kirabika bulungi ddala.
I live in the city.	Mbeera mu kibuga.
However, you are not.	Kyokka ggwe si bwe kiri.
He was doing everything for money.	Yali akola buli kimu lwa ssente.
Good to have you here.	Kirungi okubeera naawe wano.
In any case.	Mu mbeera yonna.
He was ready to go, anytime.	Yali mwetegefu okugenda, essaawa yonna.
I knew nothing about cars	Nze nali sirina kye mmanyi ku mmotoka
I couldn’t see anything	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna
I don’t know how to proceed.	Simanyi ngeri ya kugenda mu maaso.
I was happy to see home again	Nnali musanyufu okuddamu okulaba awaka
He was like that even as a kid.	Yali bw’atyo ne bwe yali akyali mwana muto.
I certainly think so.	Mazima ddala ndowooza bwe kiri.
In fact, everyone likes it a little more.	Mu butuufu buli omu ayagala nnyo katono.
And he thought.	Era n’alowooza.
I didn’t think this would happen yet	Kino nnali sirowooza nti kijja kubaawo n’okutuusa kati
It was time to get lucky.	Kyali kiseera kya kufuna mukisa.
One is a child.	Omu ye mwana.
I knew he knew that too	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi nti naye yali akimanyi
Or he went without.	Oba yagenda nga talina.
I had no interest in that	Ebyo nnali sirina kye njagala
Here I am alone.	Wano nze nzekka.
His brother stepped forward.	Muganda we yagenda mu maaso.
I feel good, actually	Mpulira bulungi, mu butuufu
I loved every job.	Buli mulimu nnali njagala nnyo.
I know that’s him	Nkimanyi nti oyo y’ali naye
I couldn’t tell the truth	Nnali sisobola kwogera mazima
I knew you would come back	Nali nkimanyi nti ojja kudda
I was so in love with it	Nnali njagala nnyo
Or read about it.	Oba okusoma ku nsonga eyo.
And it certainly is.	Era mazima ddala bwe kiri.
He wanted it, he loved it there.	Yali ayagala, yali ayagala nnyo eyo.
Back to his room.	Okudda mu kisenge kye.
That was a good thing.	Ekyo kyali kirungi.
No, you really can’t stay here.	Nedda, ddala tosobola kusigala wano.
He didn’t deserve this.	Kino yali tasaanidde.
This will help.	Kino kijja kuyamba.
He was just an ordinary person.	Yali muntu wa bulijjo yekka.
But that’s not a bad thing.	Naye ekyo si kibi.
This is a good thing.	Kino kintu kirungi.
I don’t want to know, not really.	Saagala kumanya, si ddala.
And yet! 	Era naye!
. . . .	.
He comes closer.	Ajja kumpi.
Me too.	Nange.
I’m not sure that.	Sikakasa nti.
I hope so, at any rate.	Nsuubira, mu ngeri yonna.
I will do it though.	Nja kukikola wadde.
It is very simple indeed.	Kyangu nnyo ddala.
I need to know he is okay	Nnina okumanya nti ali bulungi
I have no idea how, or why, but it is	Sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri ki, oba lwaki, naye bwe kiri
He says he’s going, he’s going.	Agamba nti agenda, agenda.
I was sure the food was me	Nali nkakasa nti emmere yali nze
Certainly not now.	Mazima ddala si kati.
I won’t get one.	Sijja kufuna emu.
I really don’t want to be that guy.	Mazima ddala saagala kubeera ggaayi oyo.
But there was nothing.	Naye nga tewali.
Or so he thought.	Oba bw’atyo bwe yalowooza.
He just wanted one thing.	Yali ayagala kintu kimu kyokka.
But no, you’re pretty good.	Naye nedda, oli mulungi nnyo.
That food.	Emmere eyo.
I still couldn’t answer	N’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kuddamu
I should have spoken sooner	Nnali nsaanidde okwogera amangu
More than me.	Okusinga nze.
There is no reason why we should.	Tewali nsonga lwaki tulina.
We can only be who we are.	Tusobola okuba kye tuli kyokka.
He saw where we both were going to be.	Yalaba ffembi gye tugenda okubeera.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
And exactly like you.	Era ddala nga ggwe.
He also loved to eat almost anything.	Era yali ayagala nnyo okulya kumpi buli kimu.
I was in the.	Nze nnali mu.
And it’s not who.	Era si ani.
Anything, in this case, being me.	Ekintu kyonna, mu mbeera eno, okubeera nze.
Now my point.	Kati ensonga yange.
I didn’t know what he needed to know	Nnali simanyi kye yali yeetaaga okumanya
He said he had no idea.	Yagambye nti talina kirowoozo kyonna.
Now he had something to do.	Kati yalina ky’alina okukola.
No one was near him.	Tewali yali kumpi naye.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
I’m myself.	Nze kennyini.
He could do that.	Ekyo yali asobola okukikola.
It was certainly beautiful there.	Mazima ddala kyali kirungi eyo.
Attitude is one thing.	Endowooza kintu kimu.
I have to go to the police today.	Nnina okugenda ku poliisi leero.
Someone else in my class has the same problem.	Omuntu omulala mu kibiina kyange alina ekizibu kye kimu.
No one comes here, and no one goes.	Tewali ajja wano, era tewali agenda.
I have a problem with that.	Ekyo nnina ekizibu.
It is a very important place	Kye kifo kikulu nnyo
I wanted to know how he was doing	Nnali njagala okumanya engeri gye yali akola
You can’t tell who he is.	Tosobola kumanya ky’ali.
I’m praying too.	Nze nange nsaba.
This is a party.	Eno mbaga.
he thought to himself	bwe yalowooza
And it wasn’t like me either.	Era nange si bwe kyali.
He went himself.	Ye kennyini yagenda.
Maybe it’s both of them.	Mpozzi nga ye bombi.
But it’s not mine.	Naye si kyange.
He won’t go to the doctor.	Tajja kugenda wa musawo.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I couldn’t function at work or in the hospital	Nnali sisobola kukola ku mulimu oba mu ddwaaliro
I thought it would help	Nalowooza nti kijja kuyamba
I knew what he was doing	Nnali mmanyi kye yali akola
That is a very good thing.	Ekyo kintu kirungi nnyo.
If only he had the time.	Singa yalina obudde.
So he asked the question.	Bwatyo bwe yabuuza.
Here is the point.	Wano waliwo ensonga.
He would have, if he had known.	Yandibadde, singa yali amanyi.
I really didn’t have much of a plan	Mazima ddala nnali sirina nnyo nteekateeka
I know, but he's doing well	Nkimanyi naye akola bulungi
It had to be me.	Kyalina okuba nga nze.
That’s what it is now.	Ekyo kye kiri kati.
He reluctantly agreed.	Yakkiriza nga tayagala.
I can’t live with him	Sisobola kubeera mu mbeera naye
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
He is a real person.	Ye muntu ddala.
I could have done it.	Nnali nsobola okukikola.
I thought you should know about this	Nze nalowooza nti olina okumanya ku kino
I thought it was good	Nalowooza nti kirungi
I hope this isn't a problem for you	Nsuubira kino si kizibu gy'oli
I probably have nothing with him	Oboolyawo sirina kintu kyonna naye
I want that too, and soon	Nange njagala eyo, era mu bbanga ttono
The same goes for us.	Ekintu kye kimu kigenda naffe.
No one seems to be home.	Tewali alabika ali waka.
He didn't know what to do.	Yali tamanyi kye yali alina kukola.
I’ll do it for you.	Nja kukikola gy’oli.
I wondered what he was going to do	Nneebuuza kye yali agenda okukola
That’s good for all of us.	Ekyo kirungi gye tuli ffenna.
Obviously, we can’t.	Kya lwatu nti tetusobola.
I didn’t know what he would do	Nnali simanyi kye yandikoze
I really can’t wait.	Mazima ddala sisobola kulinda.
I want to go see a movie	Njagala kugenda kulaba firimu
He completely agreed.	Yakkiriza ddala.
He doesn’t have a good one.	Talina mulungi.
He had to do it.	Yalina okukikola.
I actually like doing that	Mu butuufu njagala nnyo okukola ekyo
I hope you are okay now	Nsuubira nti kati oli bulungi
Not that, he said.	Si ekyo, bwe yagambye.
It’s easy to see the reason.	Kyangu okulaba ensonga.
I didn’t know there was another one	Nnali simanyi nti waliwo omulala
I could think too.	Nange nnali nsobola okulowooza.
In every single room.	Mu buli kisenge kimu.
I can’t say exactly when	Siyinza kwogera ddala ddi
And that was the hard part.	Era ekyo kye kyali ekintu ekizibu ennyo.
It may be true.	Kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
It may work it may not.	Kiyinza okukola kiyinza obutakola.
In any case.	Mu ngeri yonna.
I hope that’s all good for everyone	Nsuubira nti ekyo kyonna kirungi eri buli muntu
Not even when he would.	Si ne ddi lwe yandibadde.
I know what we can be	Nze mmanyi kye tusobola okuba
I have nothing or no one to live for	Sirina kintu kyonna oba sirina gwe nnyinza kubeerawo
That’s not mine.	Ekyo si kyange.
It may be true.	Kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
And he knew what he had to do.	Era yali amanyi kye yalina okukola.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
He knew that probably wouldn't help.	Yali akimanyi nti ekyo osanga tekijja kuyamba.
I didn’t think there was an issue	Nnali sirowooza nti waliwo ensonga
There is so much in it.	Mulimu bingi nnyo.
I was happy to have	Nnali musanyufu okuba nga nnali nfunye
I needed to see my father	Nnali nneetaaga okulaba taata
I knew you would be alone	Nali nkimanyi nti ojja kuba wekka
But he had something.	Naye yalina kye yalina.
That’s not quite true today.	Ekyo si kituufu nnyo leero.
On this view.	Ku ndowooza eno.
But he knew better.	Naye yali asinga okumanya.
Certainly there is.	Mazima ddala waliwo.
I'll wait down here.	Nja kulinda wansi wano.
And maybe we were.	Era mpozzi nga twali.
I didn’t know he was going to do that	Nnali simanyi nti ekyo yali agenda kukikola
I probably won’t though.	Osanga sigenda kukikola wadde.
I can’t talk to him right now	Sisobola kwogera naye mu kiseera kino
However, I wasn’t going to do it.	Kyokka nnali sigenda kukikola.
As always, he does it anyway.	Nga bulijjo, akikola mu ngeri yonna.
I know what he is now	Nze mmanyi ky’ali kati
Not much, you know.	Si bingi, omanyi.
I might be praying	Nnyinza okuba nga nsaba
That had been him.	Oyo yali abadde ye.
And it’s not just that.	Era si ekyo kyokka.
But that is not the case at all.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
This is not a bad idea.	Kino si kirowoozo kibi.
He didn’t know where they were.	Yali tamanyi gye bali.
He was a strong man.	Yali musajja wa maanyi.
He must have done that during the movie.	Ekyo ateekwa okuba nga yakikola mu kiseera kya firimu.
I am not ready for this	Kino siri mwetegefu
Really.	Kituufu.
He knew his brother was in trouble.	Yali akimanyi nti muganda we ali mu buzibu.
I really had no place	Mazima ddala nnali sirina kifo
And he was good to us.	Era yali mulungi gye tuli.
I probably should, actually	Oboolyawo nsaanidde, mu butuufu
I hope that will help.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kijja kuyamba.
I didn’t quite know when	Nze nali simanyi bulungi ddi
There is nothing here.	Tewali kintu kyonna kiri wano.
I was a struggling musician	Nnali muyimbi alina obuzibu
He doesn’t know.	Tamanyi.
I know why you’re here	Nze mmanyi lwaki oli wano
But that’s a problem.	Naye ekyo kizibu.
And it is very dangerous.	Era kya bulabe nnyo.
I think it would be good for all of us	Ndowooza kyandibadde kirungi ffenna
He should have.	Yandibadde alina.
I plan to go back to work	Nteekateeka kudda ku mulimu
I'll be together soon	Nja kuba wamu mu bbanga ttono
As it was the case.	Nga bwe kyali.
My brother is in the police force.	Muganda wange ali mu poliisi.
I don’t quite know why.	Simanyi bulungi lwaki.
Nothing could be worse.	Tewali kiyinza kuba kibi okusinga ekyo.
I was almost there anyway	Nali kumpi awo mu ngeri yonna
It’s simple and easy.	Kyangu era kyangu.
As it seems to go.	Nga bwe kirabika kigenda.
He had the time.	Yalina obudde.
I knew better than this	Nze nali mmanyi okusinga kino
You can do it.	Osobola okukikola.
I didn’t know what it could be, at the time.	Nali simanyi kye kiyinza okuba, mu kiseera ekyo.
Something he wanted.	Ekintu kye yali ayagala.
It’s going to be you.	Kigenda kuba ggwe.
He knew it.	Yali akimanyi.
I hope he can move on	Nsuubira nti asobola okugenda mu maaso
I know you have the same problem	Nkimanyi nti olina ekizibu kye kimu
I knew what was going to happen.	Nnali mmanyi ekigenda okubaawo.
To, to, to.	Ku, ku, ku.
I can’t find a job.	Sisobola kufuna mulimu.
He was coming.	Yali ajja.
Maybe there’s a reason for that.	Mpozzi waliwo ensonga lwaki ekyo.
I’m in the movies.	Nze ndi mu firimu.
And it’s safe to say he won’t be doing it.	Era kirungi okugamba nti tajja kuba akikola.
Not as well, though.	Kyokka si bulungi ng’ekyo.
I really hope you will make it as well	Nsuubira ddala nti ojja kukikola nga bwe kiri
But it is what it is.	Naye kye kiri.
This can be a problem.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
No one will know until the day.	Tewali agenda kumanya okutuusa olunaku.
But I'm not.	Naye nze.
I need to get another job	Nze nneetaaga okufuna omulimu omulala
Actually the same here.	Mu butuufu kye kimu ne wano.
I thought there was hope.	Nalowooza nti waliwo essuubi.
I wasn’t ready.	Nze nali siri mwetegefu.
And we’re going.	Era tugenda.
I don’t know what to do	Simanyi kya kukola
I really can’t wait.	Mazima ddala sisobola kulinda.
I won’t be seeing my best friend any time soon	Sijja kulaba mukwano gwange asinga mu bbanga ttono
He works hard from morning till night.	Akola nnyo okuva ku makya okutuuka ekiro.
This is real now.	Kino kya ddala kati.
How long can you stay?.	Osobola okumala bbanga ki?.
But of course, yes.	Naye ddala, ye.
But that was it for the most part.	Naye ekyo kye kyali okusinga bwe kyali.
I hope she wants to talk to herself	Nsuubira nti ayagala okwogera yekka
Doing it well is difficult	Okukikola obulungi kizibu
I don’t deserve anything	Nze sirina kye nsaanidde
He said he was obviously unhappy.	Yagambye nti kirabika si musanyufu.
It will definitely happen.	Mazima ddala kijja kubaawo.
I didn’t know who it was.	Nnali mmanyi ani.
We were very close friends.	Twali ba mukwano nnyo.
I know you can’t love someone like me	Nkimanyi tosobola kwagala muntu nga nze
I didn’t know what it would be like	Nnali simanyi bwe kyandibadde
It’s not short-term.	Si kya bbanga ttono.
And that’s what it is.	Era ekyo kye kiri.
I'll know when soon.	Nja kumanya ddi mu bbanga ttono.
I thought he was in jail	Nnali ndowooza nti ali mu kkomera
But he is very good.	Naye mulungi nnyo.
Although every man too.	Wadde buli musajja naye.
This is simply not true.	Kino si kituufu kyokka.
I thought you wanted to see	Nalowooza nti oyagala kulaba
He was trying to help	Yali agezaako okuyamba
He had no plans.	Yali talina nteekateeka yonna.
It was just what it was.	Kyali kiki kyokka.
But you are.	Naye ggwe oli.
I’ve just got it.	Nze nfunye kyokka.
I didn’t know where we were	Nnali simanyi gye twali
But we are not like that.	Naye ffe si bwe tuli.
I want to move on.	Njagala kugenda mu maaso.
My best friend is a teacher.	Mukwano gwange asinga musomesa.
I didn’t know it was you	Nali simanyi nti ggwe
He was stronger now than he had ever been before.	Yali wa maanyi kati okusinga bwe yali emabegako.
I couldn’t eat anything	Nnali sisobola kulya kintu kyonna
It doesn’t really matter.	Mu butuufu si kikulu.
I guess he was going home	Ntebereza nti yali agenda waka
But it was very important.	Naye kyali kikulu nnyo.
You love it so much.	Ggwe ayagala nnyo.
But now he has .	Naye kati alina .
Today.	Leero.
I feel a little sick	Mpulira nga ndi mulwadde katono
This can be a problem.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
Maybe you’ll get the job, maybe you won’t.	Mpozzi ojja kufuna omulimu, mpozzi tojja kufuna.
I have so many things to do	Nnina ebintu bingi nnyo bye nnina okukola
That’s pretty good of me.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo ku nze.
Obviously that’s not quite right.	Kya lwatu ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
You have to do well in the morning.	Olina okukola obulungi ku makya.
It just looks good.	Kirabika bulungi kyokka.
I think he is in danger	Ndowooza ali mu bulabe
But there is a problem.	Naye waliwo ekizibu.
A guy like me who lives there, that's a thing	Ggaayi nga nze abeera eyo, ekyo kintu
No one knew what to say.	Tewali yali amanyi kya kwogera.
This is a.	Kino kya...
It was really beautiful.	Ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
I should probably do that.	Oboolyawo ekyo nsaanidde okukikola.
But this is not true.	Naye kino si kya mazima.
I don’t know if this is a good idea or not.	Simanyi oba kino kirowoozo kirungi oba nedda.
I was nervous and terrified.	Nali ntya era nga ntya nnyo.
I didn’t know what to say for a moment	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera okumala akaseera katono
Not a car and not a bus.	Si mmotoka era si bbaasi.
Maybe this, maybe that.	Mpozzi kino, mpozzi ekyo.
I’m here to stay.	Nze ndi wano.
And my wife.	Ne mukyala wange.
You were everything to me.	Ggwe wali buli kimu gyendi.
I wonder what it is.	Nze nneebuuza kiki.
I think that’s a good thing	Ndowooza ekyo kintu kirungi
Everyone has time.	Buli muntu alina obudde.
I’m just one guy.	Nze ndi ggaayi omu yekka.
I thought it would work well	Nalowooza nti kijja kukola bulungi
That’s a terrible thing.	Ekyo kibi nnyo.
I just want to do that tonight	Nze njagala kukola ekyo kyokka ekiro kino
But that’s actually a good thing.	Naye mu butuufu ekyo kintu kirungi.
He said he would just watch.	Yagambye nti agenda kumala kulaba.
But that’s nothing.	Naye ekyo si kintu kyonna.
I didn’t know what was going on.	Nnali simanyi kigenda mu maaso.
Perhaps he hadn’t.	Oboolyawo yali talina.
He was stronger than that.	Yali asinga ekyo amaanyi.
You have to get out of here.	Olina okuva wano.
You’re not the same.	Ggwe si bwe kiri.
And he knows the whole thing for a long time.	Era ekintu kyonna akimanyi okumala ebbanga ddene.
I know the guy, actually	Nze mmanyi ggaayi, mu butuufu
You can do that.	Ekyo osobola okukikola.
I can’t be with someone	Sisobola kubeera na muntu
He had been afraid.	Yali abadde atya.
I’m making money.	Nze nkola ssente.
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
I have to go to that place immediately	Nnina okugenda mu kifo ekyo mu bwangu
He was going, but he didn’t really want to go.	Yali agenda, naye nga mu butuufu tayagala kugenda.
But there was.	Naye nga waliwo.
Why, no one knows.	Lwaki, tewali amanyi.
I know exactly where it is	Nze mmanyi bulungi gye kiri
I don’t want to go to parties	Saagala kugenda ku mbaga
I wanted to win at all costs	Nnali njagala kuwangula mu ngeri yonna
You have to drive there.	Olina okuvuga eyo.
Face to face.	Maaso ku maaso.
I want it here in the shower	Njagala wano mu ssaawa
I know this will never happen in reality.	Nkimanyi nti kino tekijja kubaawo mu butuufu.
We really should move on.	Ddala tusaanidde okugenda mu maaso.
At the time I didn’t care	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sifaayo
I just didn’t want to.	Nze nnali saagala kyokka.
I didn’t want a relationship	Nnali saagala mukwano
I wasn’t going to believe that anymore	Ekyo nnali sigenda kuddamu kukkiriza
But he was young.	Naye nga muto.
I'm not going anywhere yet.	Nze n'okutuusa kati sirina gye ngenda.
I couldn’t, of course.	Nnali sisobola, ddala.
He saw so many things.	Yalaba ebintu bingi nnyo.
That’s not the reality though.	Ekyo si kye kituufu wadde.
How he knew this, he could not say.	Engeri gye yali amanyi kino, yali tasobola kwogera.
He needed to go.	Yali yeetaaga okugenda.
I work very very very hard	Nkola nnyo nnyo nnyo
I knew what it could do.	Nnali mmanyi kye kiyinza okukola.
I think everyone is happy.	Ndowooza buli muntu musanyufu.
I just need a little time	Nze nneetaaga akaseera katono
I was thinking today about my father	Nali ndowooza leero ku taata
I think we can win.	Ndowooza tusobola okuwangula.
I wonder if he is alone	Nze nneebuuza oba ali yekka
He’s probably already gone.	Oboolyawo yagenda dda.
I was thinking about something for a moment	Nali ndowooza ku kintu okumala akaseera katono
He is a morning person.	Ye muntu wa makya.
I wasn’t always sure he could do it	Bulijjo nnali sikakasa nti yali asobola okukikola
Me, I don’t want to do that.	Nze, ekyo saagala kukikola.
And no one was thinking clearly.	Era tewali yali alowooza bulungi.
At this point, it probably mattered.	Ku ssaawa eno, oboolyawo kyali kikulu.
Maybe that's why?.	Mpozzi y'ensonga lwaki?.
I don’t think it would.	Sirowooza nti kyandibadde.
I didn’t want to stay	Nze nali saagala kusigala nga nkola
I am not sure how to deal with this.	Sikakasa ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukola ku nsonga eno.
But this is not quite true.	Naye kino si kituufu nnyo.
I can do a lot of things	Nsobola okukola ebintu bingi
I think he knows everything.	Ndowooza buli kimu akimanyi.
He doesn't want that either.	Ekyo naye tayagala.
There is a response.	Mulimu okuddamu.
He felt very comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo.
I was working on this today below	Nali nkola ku nsonga eno leero wansi
It’s actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
You may have it.	Oyinza okuba nga olina.
However, I will say one thing.	Kyokka nja kwogera ekintu kimu.
You certainly have.	Mazima ddala olina.
Very good indeed!.	Kirungi nnyo ddala!.
I couldn’t see what it was	Nnali sisobola kulaba kye kyali
It’s happening right now.	Kigenda mu maaso mu kiseera kino.
He himself often thought the same thing.	Ye kennyini yali atera okulowooza ekintu kye kimu.
I didn’t know anyone.	Nnali sirina gwe mmanyi.
This can be a problem.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
The thing is that.	Ekintu kiri nti.
If you only knew.	Singa wali omanyi kyokka.
I am not sure about this.	Sikakasa ku kino.
Not much at all.	Si bingi n’akatono.
And here you come.	Era wano ojja.
I’m pretty good now	Nze kati ndi mulungi nnyo
But someone has to speak up.	Naye omuntu alina okwogera.
Not much.	Si bingi.
I have something to say.	Nnina kye njagala okwogera.
Powerful.	Maanyi.
I can do it again.	Nsobola okuddamu okukikola.
He can win.	Asobola okuwangula.
I love having him on.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye ku...
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
It wasn’t his car.	Si yali mmotoka ye.
She looked absolutely beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi ddala.
I will be there.	Nja kubeerawo.
But he couldn’t see anything.	Naye yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
But you, well.	Naye ggwe, bulungi.
I wanted to be around him.	Nnali njagala kubeera kumpi naye.
He is not at the house.	Tali ku nnyumba.
I was on the floor.	Nali wansi.
No one really saw this coming.	Ddala tewali yalaba kino nga kijja.
But he is.	Naye ye.
I didn’t know what he knew	Nze nali simanyi kye yali amanyi
And there she was, in my house.	Era awo we yali, mu nnyumba yange.
I want to be here.	Njagala okuba wano.
I feel like someone is in the house	Mpulira nga waliwo omuntu mu nnyumba
I just wanted him to	Nze nnali njagala kyokka akole
We don’t have time.	Tetulina budde.
That’s just so good.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo kyokka.
It would be nice.	Kyandibadde kirungi.
The reason why.	Ensonga lwaki...
It can happen.	Kiyinza okubaawo.
I had no plans to do that at all	Ekyo nnali sirina nteekateeka yonna ya kukikola n’akatono
This was the reason why.	Eno ye yali ensonga lwaki.
I was so scared	Nnali ntya nnyo
That’s where it goes.	Eyo gye kigenda.
But he was not ordinary.	Naye yali si wa bulijjo.
It can happen hour after hour.	Kiyinza okubaawo essaawa ku ssaawa.
I love working with you	Njagala nnyo okukola naawe
I have no idea what that is.	Sirina kye mmanyi nti ekyo kye kiri.
I knew better than to say no	Nnali mmanyi okusinga okugamba nti nedda
We were in trouble.	Twali mu buzibu.
I still can’t see anyone on	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kulaba muntu yenna ku
We can do the same thing.	Naffe tusobola okukola kye kimu.
And we are here now.	Era tuli wano kati.
I said no to everything	Nagamba nti nedda ku buli kimu
It’s not a movie.	Si firimu.
I was doing a good job	Nnali nkola omulimu mulungi
You want to be ready to go.	Oyagala kubeera mwetegefu okugenda.
He felt happy.	Yawulira nga musanyufu.
No, it wasn’t.	Nedda, si bwe yali.
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
But this is not the crux of the matter.	Naye kino si kikulu ku nsonga.
Why is this happening.	Lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
We are moving forward.	Tugenda mu maaso.
I hoped he would be around for a long time	Nali nsuubira nti ajja kubeerawo okumala ebbanga ddene
I just wanted to go home.	Nnali njagala kudda waka kyokka.
I think this will help	Ndowooza kino kijja kuyamba
I need help, you know that	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi, ekyo okimanyi
Not much there.	Si bingi awo.
I am alone and alone	Nze ndi nzekka era ndi nzekka
You're coming with me.	Ojja nange.
But he was there all week.	Naye yali awo wiiki yonna.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
I love you too.	Naawe njagala nnyo.
That may be true today.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu leero.
I wanted to stay with you	Nnali njagala kusigala naawe
Not all of me.	Si nze yenna.
I wasn’t doing anything	Nze nali sirina kye nkola
He has to do it his way.	Alina okukikola mu ngeri ye.
It's up to you to know.	Kiri gy'oli okumanya.
He didn’t want to work.	Yali tayagala kukola.
That way he went, this way he came.	Mu ngeri eyo gye yagenda, mu ngeri eno gye yajja.
I am ready, he said	Ndi mwetegefu, bwe yagambye
Not for that reason.	Si lwa nsonga eyo.
I hope you won’t be there.	Nsuubira nti tojja kubeerawo.
Maybe like us.	Mpozzi nga ffe.
The point is now true.	Ensonga kati mazima.
Going for everything.	Okugenda ku buli kimu.
However, I wasn’t sure	Kyokka nnali simanyi bulungi
And I was working hard yesterday	Era nnali nkola nnyo eggulo
We don’t have it.	Tetulina.
You know one.	Ggwe omanyi omu.
In the plural.	Mu bungi.
He said you were.	Yagamba nti ggwe wali.
And it was the same.	Era bwe kyali.
He could see everything, actually.	Yali asobola okulaba buli kimu, mu butuufu.
I really think he does	Ndowooza ddala nti akola bw’atyo
We’ll be able to go soon.	Tujja kusobola okugenda mu bbanga ttono.
They were one man.	Baali musajja omu.
I knew almost nothing about him	Kumpi nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye
I wonder if this book is ordinary	Nze nneebuuza oba ekitabo kino kya bulijjo
A short drive.	Okuvuga akaseera katono.
No one wants to.	Tewali ayagala.
No one knows everything.	Tewali muntu yenna amanyi buli kimu.
He is in good shape.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi.
I want to know these things	Njagala okumanya ebintu bino
I wanted to do it again immediately.	Nnali njagala okuddamu okukikola amangu ddala.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
I know he will do it	Nkimanyi nti ajja kukikola
I was hoping it would be you	Nali nsuubira nti wandibadde ggwe
I just didn’t want to be alone	Nze nnali saagala kubeera nzekka
I don’t really want anything	Sirina kye njagala ddala
No matter what I do.	Ne bwe nkola ntya.
And so were we.	Era naffe bwe twali.
I just don’t know.	Nze simanyi kyokka.
I think you’re ready	Nze ndowooza nti oli mwetegefu
None, actually.	Tewali, mu butuufu.
It was a good idea.	Yali kirowoozo kirungi.
I know now he is trying	Nkimanyi kati agezaako
I couldn’t do it alone	Nnali siyinza kukikola nzekka
I just want to see my wife now	Njagala kulaba mukyala wange kyokka kati
I really didn’t want to talk to anyone	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kwogera na muntu
I can’t go to the hospital	Sisobola kugenda mu ddwaaliro
I want to see him do really well.	Njagala okulaba ng’akola bulungi ddala.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
But it’s not money.	Naye si ssente.
I know we will be best friends	Nkimanyi nti tujja kuba ba mukwano nnyo
Day in and day out.	Olunaku ku lunaku.
Will definitely buy again.	Mazima ddala ajja kuddamu okugula.
Great, you think.	Kikulu, olowooza.
I couldn’t wait to see what would happen.	Nnali siyinza kulinda kulaba kiki ekigenda okubaawo.
It is a very serious problem.	Kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
It’s not realistic.	Si kya ddala.
He is happy to be himself.	Ali musanyufu okubeera ye kennyini.
It goes for every issue.	Kigenda ku buli nsonga.
I didn’t really have anything	Mu butuufu nnali sirina kintu
I had no idea where we were	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi gye twali
I can’t believe this is happening right now	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kino kigenda mu maaso mu kiseera kino
Everyone has loved it.	Buli omu abadde ayagala nnyo.
If this.	Si oyo.
I don’t think it is	Sirowooza nti bwe kiri
I actually feel much better now	Mu butuufu mpulira bulungi nnyo kati
Everyone did it the same way.	Buli omu yakikola mu ngeri emu.
But I wanted to.	Kyokka nnali njagala.
I didn’t know how to respond	Nnali simanyi ngeri ya kuddamu
But he got his chance.	Naye yafuna omukisa gwe.
I didn’t think that was going to happen	Ekyo nnali sirowooza nti kyali kigenda kubaawo
You don’t know what it was like back then.	Tomanyi bwe kyali mu kiseera ekyo.
I'm so glad you like it	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti oyagala
No one seemed to be doing just one thing.	Tewali yali alabika ng’akola kintu kimu kyokka.
He was everything to me.	Yali buli kimu gyendi.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
She was his wife.	Yali mukyala we.
I knew she was fine	Namanya nti yali bulungi
He felt comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi.
I have a house here.	Nnina ennyumba wano.
He does the exact same thing.	Akola ekintu kye kimu ddala.
Just like the car.	Nga bwe kiri ku mmotoka.
He was going to be a doctor.	Yali agenda kubeera musawo.
I just have to be me	Nze nnina okubeera nze kyokka
No one does it.	Tewali akikola.
But we can’t do without time.	Naye tetusobola kukola nga tetulina budde.
Good to have another chance.	Kirungi okufuna omukisa omulala.
Not on my watch.	Si ku ssaawa yange.
I'm not sure what's wrong with me.	Sikakasa kiki ekizibu gyendi.
I wonder what he was doing	Nze nneebuuza kye yali akola
I almost hit the bottom	Nze kumpi okukuba wansi
Maybe he was asleep.	Mpozzi nga yeebase.
I’m doing well.	Nkola bulungi.
We have to do that.	Ekyo tulina okukikola.
I didn’t want to be here and he knew it	Saagala kubeera wano era yali akimanyi
But he won’t eat.	Naye tajja kulya.
I really have to go	Ddala nnina okugenda
Sure, it can be difficult.	Mazima ddala, kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
I wanted to be in the air.	Nnali njagala kubeera mu bbanga.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
I think he is a good person.	Ndowooza muntu mulungi.
Not until now.	Si okutuusa kati.
It’s close, but not quite there.	Kiri kumpi, naye si awo ddala.
I am so glad they are here.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti bali wano.
I didn’t know how	Nze nali simanyi ngeri ki gye nnali nkola
But none right now.	Naye tewali mu kiseera kino.
Watching movies will never be the same.	Okulaba firimu tekijja kuddamu kubeera nga bwe kyali.
He was alone, he knew that.	Yali yekka, ekyo yali akimanyi.
We need to do it.	Twetaaga okukikola.
I have no interest in you at all	Nze sirina kye njagala ku ggwe n’akatono
I’m sure he’s fine.	Nkakasa nti ali bulungi.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
But you are there now.	Naye ggwe kati oli awo.
I had no choice in the matter	Nnali sirina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo
He was a father and really lucky.	Yali taata era nga ddala wa mukisa.
And now or not.	Era kati oba si bwe kiri.
Not today, anyway.	Si leero, mu ngeri yonna.
I just work hard	Nze nkola nnyo kyokka
I hope he never does it again	Nsuubira tajja kuddamu kukikola
I won’t be that person	Sijja kuba muntu oyo
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
We'll talk.	Tujja kwogera.
And it goes on and on.	Era kigenda mu maaso ne kigenda mu maaso.
That wasn’t the point though.	Ekyo si kye kyali ensonga wadde.
That was a good thing.	Ekyo kyali kirungi.
I thought for a moment how to respond	Nalowooza okumala akaseera katono engeri gye nnyinza okuddamu
I already knew who	Namanya dda ani
Every day is the same.	Buli lunaku kye kimu.
It seems to me he can’t win.	Kirabika gyendi tasobola kuwangula.
I don’t want to go into that	Ekyo saagala kugenda mu nsonga eyo
Getting help.	Okufuna obuyambi.
But that’s my dad.	Naye oyo ye taata wange.
Everything was going to be fine.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda kubeera bulungi.
It is absolutely true.	Kituufu ddala.
You obviously want to be here.	Kya lwatu oyagala kubeera wano.
One thought you were a man.	Omu yalowooza nti oli musajja.
And it’s not for the money.	Era si lwa ssente.
We are here now.	Tuli wano kati.
I'm probably safe	Oboolyawo sirina bulabe
Or so he said.	Oba bwatyo bwe yagamba.
It’s a lot of money	Ssente nnyingi nnyo
But there’s more.	Naye waliwo bingi.
Himself.	Ye kennyini.
He couldn’t see anything.	Yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
He said he wanted one too.	Yagambye nti naye ayagala emu.
I hope you come home soon, to me	Nsuubira nti ojja kudda eka mangu, gyendi
I love that you want to do this	Njagala nnyo nti kino oyagala okukola
I'll be there or here for a while.	Nja kubeera awo oba wano okumala akaseera.
I have nothing to fear	Sirina kye ntya
I couldn’t know for sure, really	Nnali sisobola kumanya bulungi, ddala
It was as good as any.	Kyali kirungi nga kyonna.
I certainly hope you can too	Mazima ddala nsuubira naawe osobola
That was really something.	Ekyo ddala kyali kintu.
I just didn’t know where that could be	Nze nnali simanyi ekyo gye kiyinza okuba
I’m not in any hurry.	Siri mu bwangu bwonna.
I didn’t know what time it was	Nnali simanyi ssaawa mmeka
He said there wasn't.	Yagambye nti tewali.
It can only be one thing.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu kimu kyokka.
It’s a current problem.	Kizibu kya kati.
He may not have known then but he does now.	Ayinza okuba nga yali tamanyi mu kiseera ekyo naye kati amanyi.
He agreed to do the work.	Yakkiriza okukola omulimu.
You want to see these things.	Oyagala okulaba ebintu bino.
I can do a while	Nsobola okukola akaseera
It's dangerous.	Kya bulabe.
I think maybe he had been interested, too	Ndowooza osanga naye yali abadde ayagala, naye
I don’t want this obviously.	Kino saagala kya lwatu.
I want you to want to be with me	Njagala oyagala okubeera nange
I was very happy to do it.	Nnali musanyufu nnyo okukikola.
He has been good to me.	Abadde mulungi gyendi.
But the thing is, no one knew.	Naye ekintu kiri nti, tewali yali amanyi.
And that likely won’t work.	Era ekyo kirabika tekijja kukola.
I want that for every child	Ekyo njagala ku buli mwana
I want the time.	Njagala obudde.
I won’t say anything about it, to anyone.	Sijja kwogera kintu kyonna ku nsonga eno, eri omuntu yenna.
I just want to do everything.	Njagala kukola buli kimu kyokka.
I want to be with him all the time	Njagala kubeera naye buli kiseera
It went very well.	Yagenda bulungi nnyo.
You know you will.	Omanyi nti ojja kukikola.
Something you want to see.	Ekintu ky’oyagala okulaba.
She shouldn’t be here, in this room.	Tasaanidde kubeera wano, mu kisenge kino.
He would be fine.	Yandibadde bulungi.
I just love talking to you	Njagala nnyo kwogera naawe kyokka
He will probably come soon.	Oboolyawo ajja kujja mangu.
He was there, of course.	Yali awo, ddala.
One problem, however.	Kyokka, ekizibu kimu.
There is no way to drive.	Tewali ngeri ya kuvuga mmotoka.
He fell asleep deeply.	Yeebase nnyo.
He spoke to her.	Yayogera naye.
I know you are not a doctor	Nkimanyi nti toli musawo wa musawo
It won’t be the same for us.	Tekijja kuba kye kimu gye tuli.
he was planning ahead.	yali ateekateeka nga bukyali.
You don’t have to tell anyone.	Tolina kubuulira muntu yenna.
He has no reason.	Talina nsonga.
I need to get out of this house	Nze nneetaaga okuva mu nnyumba eno
I have no idea how to respond	Sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri gye nnyinza kuddamu
I thought that was pretty cool	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo
You have to act now.	Olina okukola kati.
I want to know what’s going on	Njagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
I didn’t even know who	Nnali simanyi na ani
I wonder what's going on at home, she thought	Nze nneebuuza ekigenda mu maaso awaka, bwe yalowooza
Maybe it is, maybe not.	Mpozzi bwe kiri, mpozzi si bwe kiri.
I was good at my job	Nnali mulungi mu mulimu gwange
He lives here.	Abeera wano.
I didn’t know why.	Nnali simanyi lwaki.
I couldn’t tell anyone the truth	Nnali sisobola kubuulira muntu yenna mazima
I was very young at this time	Mu kiseera kino nnali muto nnyo
No one knew, no one wanted to know.	Tewali yali amanyi, tewali yali ayagala kumanya.
That's what you said.	Bwatyo bwe wagamba.
This is a dangerous time.	Kino kiseera kya bulabe.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
I said he was my wife’s friend to me	Nagamba nti ye mukwano gwa mukyala wange gyendi
I was like ready to go back to work	Nali nga mwetegefu okudda ku mulimu
I have a personality that loves to shop	Nnina omuntu ayagala ennyo okugula
You can get almost anything.	Osobola okufuna kumpi ekintu kyonna.
He will want to go home.	Ajja kwagala okudda eka.
I didn’t know why.	Nnali simanyi lwaki.
No, it’s not true.	Nedda, si kituufu.
Or who exactly did what.	Oba ani ddala yakola ki.
What a lucky, lucky man.	Nga musajja wa mukisa, wa mukisa.
I just want it early in the morning	Njagala ku makya amangu kyokka
That will come.	Ekyo kijja kujja.
I was just wondering if you were okay	Nze nali nneebuuza kyokka oba oli bulungi
He goes without us.	Agenda nga tetulina.
I knew almost nothing about him	Kumpi nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye
I love it, being with one guy	Njagala nnyo, okubeera ne ggaayi omu
You can call anytime.	Osobola okukuba essimu essaawa yonna.
But he was much more than that.	Naye yali asinga nnyo ekyo.
I can tell you are much better than him	Nsobola okugamba nti oli mulungi nnyo okusinga ye
I'm glad to see you're okay	Ndi musanyufu okulaba nga oli bulungi
I really don’t know the problem.	Mazima ddala simanyi buzibu.
He was just a young man.	Yali musajja muto yekka.
However, I wanted to try	Kyokka nnali njagala kugezaako
Now he could go to work.	Kati yali asobola okugenda ku mulimu.
I thought you were my wife	Nalowooza nti oli mukyala wange
This coming week will be great.	Wiiki eno ejja ejja kuba nnungi nnyo.
I need to talk to you about something	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe ku kintu
I was already in that position	Nze nnali dda mu kifo ekyo
I can be good or not good to them	Nsobola okuba omulungi oba si mulungi gye bali
He said with.	Yagambye ne.
I think the issue is access.	Ndowooza ensonga eri ku kufuna.
I am also practical	Nze nange ndi wa nkola
However, I knew better	Kyokka nnali mmanyi bulungi
I can’t work out why	Sisobola kukola ku nsonga lwaki
At school, in the hospital.	Ku ssomero, mu ddwaaliro.
No, that’s not the same thing.	Nedda, ekyo si kye kimu.
He usually makes a call like this.	Ye atera okukuba essimu nga eno.
I didn’t know how to work	Nze nali simanyi ngeri ya kukola
I will do this.	Kino nja kukikola.
I just wanted to.	Nze nnali njagala kyokka.
I can never go back to the way it was	Siyinza kudda mu ngeri gye kyali
I want to move on.	Njagala kugenda mu maaso.
I wonder where it is now.	Nneebuuza kati gye kiri.
He was in the room all morning.	Yali mu kisenge enkya yonna.
He seems to be doing well.	Alabika akola bulungi.
But he is not well.	Naye ye tali bulungi.
And that’s mostly the case.	Era ekyo okusinga bwe kiri.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
He could hardly deal with one.	Yali tasobola bulungi kukola ku kimu.
This looks great.	Kino kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He didn’t have to do it.	Yali talina kukikola.
We don’t have a problem.	Tetulina buzibu.
I want anything, you know? 	Njagala ekintu kyonna, omanyi?
There is no house for me.	Tewali nnyumba yange.
I know what you want	Nze mmanyi ky’oyagala
I have a good friend	Nnina mukwano gwange omulungi
Actually, you can’t.	Mu butuufu, tosobola.
I guess that was fine	Ntebereza nti ekyo kyali kirungi
He said that’s why he was here.	Yagambye nti y’ensonga lwaki yali wano.
We don’t have to do it.	Tetulina kukikola.
He may be younger.	Ayinza okuba nga muto.
I really wanted to say	Nnali njagala nnyo okugamba nti
He goes to me.	Agenda gye ndi.
At the time, he looked good.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali alabika bulungi.
It’s a problem for us too.	Naffe kizibu gye tuli.
I'm good to go.	Ndi mulungi okugenda.
I am busy being.	Ndi bbize okubeera.
I couldn’t do anything	Nnali sirina kye nsobola kukola
They were his friends.	Baali mikwano gye.
That would be us.	Ekyo kyandibadde ffe.
They were then and they are now.	Baali mu kiseera ekyo era kati bwe bali.
The phone started ringing.	Essimu yatandika okukuba.
This isn’t all bad.	Kino kyonna si kibi.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
I was alone in my room	Nali nzekka mu kisenge kyange
The best father ever.	Taata asinga obulungi.
I just can’t accept this idea.	Nze sisobola kukkiriza ndowooza eno.
I hope he does come	Nsuubira nti ddala ajja
That something can be anything.	Nti ekintu kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
I have one.	Nnina emu.
This is a problem for everyone.	Kino kizibu eri buli muntu.
I can’t tell what it is exactly	Sisobola kumanya kye kiri ddala
But not for you.	Naye si lwa ggwe.
He wanted it, it was there.	Yali ayagala, kyali awo.
He could do it now.	Yali asobola okukikola kati.
I think you know that	Ndowooza ekyo okimanyi
I am not a human being.	Nze siri muntu.
He didn’t know what he was.	Yali tamanyi kye yali.
That’s where we’re going.	Eyo gye tugenda.
It’s nothing to me.	Si kintu kyonna gyendi.
In this case, it was me.	Mu mbeera eno, nnali nze.
I love it so much.	Nze njagala nnyo.
I knew nothing of all this	Bino byonna nnali sirina kye mmanyi
This is one of many	Kino kye kimu ku bingi
I couldn’t have him doing that	Nnali sisobola kuba na ye ng’akola ekyo
We can do it, you and I.	Tusobola okukikola, nze naawe.
There is no one.	Tewali muntu yenna.
I knew nothing about cars	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku mmotoka
No one knew what it was.	Tewali yali amanyi kye kyali.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
. . . .	.
I just want to go	Njagala kugenda kyokka
And he is lucky.	Era alina omukisa.
Now you will stay.	Kati ojja kusigala.
He is still very good.	Akyali mulungi nnyo.
I'm thinking.	Nze ndowooza.
No one said she looked good.	Tewali yagamba nti alabika bulungi.
I have a lot of money	Nnina ssente nnyingi
However, it is not him.	Kyokka si ye.
I am sure this is true	Nkakasa nti kino kituufu
I guess it is.	Ntebereza nti bwe kiri.
It had to do it.	Kyalina okukikola.
I was thinking about it	Nnali ndowooza ku nsonga eyo
This is a good thing.	Kino kirungi.
I wanted all those things too	Nange nnali njagala ebintu ebyo byonna
I wasn’t sure about what, but it was real	Nnali sikakasa ku kiki, naye kyali kya ddala
I think that’s very important	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo
We will be busy together.	Tujja kuba bbize wamu.
He would like to get home.	Yandibadde ayagala okutuuka awaka.
Not in any way.	Si mu ngeri yonna.
I guess that’s not the case.	Ntebereza nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
I guess he didn’t have to	Ntebereza nti yali talina kukikola
I had no idea that at all	Nnali sirina ndowooza eyo n’akatono
I don’t know exactly where they are.	Simanyi bulungi gye bali.
I still didn’t care.	N’okutuusa kati nnali sifaayo.
I can get home alone	Nsobola okutuuka awaka nzekka
I want to know what you were thinking earlier	Njagala okumanya kye wali olowooza emabegako
', '.	', '.
I couldn’t live for that	Ekyo nnali sisobola kubeerawo
I’m going to be pretty good	Ngenda kuba bulungi nnyo
I can do it in practice	Nsobola okukikola mu nkola
He will probably be better than himself tomorrow.	Oboolyawo ajja kuba asinga ye kennyini enkya.
Every time.	Buli kiseera.
I think that would be good	Ndowooza ekyo kyandibadde kirungi
But this for a moment.	Naye bino akaseera.
I knew it was serious.	Namanya nti kyali kya maanyi.
I know what it is now.	Nze mmanyi kye kiri kati.
A little early to be making dinner	Nga bukyali katono okubeera nga okola ekyeggulo
And he absolutely knows it’s true.	Era akimanyi ddala nti kituufu.
I want to know why	Njagala okumanya lwaki
This is why he was afraid.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki yali atya.
I think that’s what he would want.	Ndowooza ekyo kye yandiyagadde.
But the food was great.	Naye emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
I have no idea who he is or anything	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ani oba ekintu kyonna
His dog is coming.	Embwa ye ejja.
I love to read.	Njagala nnyo okusoma.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
I said you can’t do it yourself	Nagamba nti ggwe kennyini tosobola kukikola
I know you’re on to something.	Nkimanyi nti oli ku kintu.
I wanted to be a father	Nnali njagala nnyo okubeera taata
I’m very willing	Nze ndi mwetegefu nnyo
I can’t wait to get one.	Siyinza kulinda kufuna emu.
Maybe it’s as good as you.	Mpozzi nga kirungi nga ggwe.
I am so glad you are here!.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti oli wano!.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
I feel really good	Mpulira bulungi ddala
It is very simple and easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo era kyangu okukola.
You’re young.	Oli muto.
I could do so much right now	Nnali nsobola okukola bingi nnyo mu kiseera kino
I am afraid myself.	Nze kennyini ntya.
I was so in love with it	Nnali njagala nnyo
There is no problem here.	Wano tewali buzibu.
I would love to know who it is	Njagala nnyo okumanya ani
Now, it was his turn.	Kati, kyali kiseera kye.
He told me himself.	Yang’amba ye kennyini.
I’m not going anywhere	Nze sirina gye ngenda
I know absolutely nothing	Nze sirina kye mmanyi n’akatono
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
I was a very imaginative child	Nze nali mwana alina okulowooza ennyo
I don’t want to talk about this	Kino saagala kwogera ku nsonga eno
he is very active.	akola nnyo.
I've got it.	Nze nfunye.
Apparently she looks good.	Kirabika alabika bulungi.
I didn’t think it was very important	Nnali sirowooza nti kikulu nnyo
I am very well off.	Nze ndi bulungi nnyo.
I am well aware of that	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi
And it was always the same.	Era bulijjo kyali kye kimu.
I have nowhere to live.	Sirina we nnyinza kubeera.
I suppose we need to tell the time	Nsuubira nti twetaaga okubuulira obudde
I didn’t even know how to respond.	Nnali simanyi na ngeri gye nnali nnyinza kuddamu.
I don’t want anyone to know anything	Saagala muntu yenna kumanya kintu kyonna
I have to see who’s hitting	Nnina okulaba ani akuba
In one hour.	Mu ssaawa emu.
This is not very good.	Kino si kirungi nnyo.
I live in the city.	Mbeera mu kibuga.
I want you, and you alone	Njagala ggwe, era ggwe wekka
And obviously, it’s not true.	Era kya lwatu, si kituufu.
I knew these things	Ebintu bino nnali mmanyi
It’s a matter of policy.	Ensonga ya nkola.
I expected the same here	Nali nsuubira kye kimu wano
You know if you are.	Omanyi oba oli.
I know exactly	Nze mmanyi bulungi
This is a very important time.	Kino kiseera kikulu nnyo.
But he was very sick.	Naye yali mulwadde nnyo.
Maybe someone else.	Mpozzi omuntu omulala.
I wonder if that’s true	Nze nneebuuza oba ekyo kituufu
And I knew he would come tonight	Era nali mmanyi nti ajja kujja ekiro kino
I wanted to be good.	Nnali njagala kubeera mulungi.
I can do that too.	Ekyo nange nsobola okukikola.
You will do it.	Ojja kukikola.
I will never have my wife again at that time.	Sijja kuddamu kufuna mukyala wange mu kiseera ekyo.
I knew it actually wasn’t	Namanya nti mu butuufu si bwe kyali
However, at the time	Kyokka mu kiseera ekyo .
But I can’t do it.	Naye sisobola kukikola.
I would love to read your opinion	Njagala nnyo okusoma endowooza yo
But he was ready to go.	Naye yali mwetegefu okugenda.
But he didn’t deserve what he got.	Naye ekyo kye yafuna yali tasaanidde.
I love this product	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino
I know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi.
That’s how everyone is.	Bw’atyo buli muntu bw’atyo.
probably not.	oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
And he will be childless.	Era ajja kuba talina mwana.
That, he expected.	Ekyo, bwe yali asuubira.
From his house.	Okuva mu nnyumba ye.
I love it down here too	Njagala nnyo wansi wano nange
I don’t care about anything.	Sifaayo ku nsonga yonna.
I know absolutely nothing	Nze sirina kye mmanyi n’akatono
He.	Ye.
But he was very good.	Naye yali mulungi nnyo.
I want to work on being a better person	Njagala okukola ku kubeera omuntu omulungi
I wish I could be his friend	Njagala nnyo okubeera mukwano gwe
And he felt the same way.	Era naye yawulira bw’atyo.
It’s a dangerous thing.	Kintu kya bulabe.
I am in a good mood.	Ndi mu mbeera nnungi.
I love that dog.	Njagala nnyo embwa eyo.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I want to be with you always	Njagala kubeera naawe bulijjo
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
Or a week ago.	Oba wiiki emu emabega.
This is easy to do.	Kino kyangu okukola.
I want in everything	Njagala mu buli kimu
Are you ready to do it?.	Oli mwetegefu okukikola?.
Really, that’s what it is.	Ddala, ekyo kye kiri.
That’s really a problem.	Ekyo ddala kizibu.
No one knew where you were.	Tewali yali amanyi gy’oli.
He had been happy before.	Yali abadde musanyufu emabegako.
However, I am curious	Kyokka, njagala nnyo okumanya
I am very curious	Njagala nnyo okumanya
I was scared, terrified	Nali ntya, nga ntya nnyo
You are lucky to have made it this far.	Oli wa mukisa okutuuka wano.
And he was strong, too.	Era naye yali wa maanyi.
I doubt we will ever know	Nbuusabuusa nti tujja kumanya
I love to hit.	Njagala nnyo okukuba.
I’m ready to do this .	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola kino .
I couldn’t believe it was real	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti kyali kya ddala
I have to hang up soon	Nnina okuggyako essimu mu bbanga ttono
Now there is one.	Kati waliwo emu.
I have the power to do it	Nnina amaanyi okukikola
In a way, he was happy.	Mu ngeri emu, yali musanyufu.
I want someone who knows how to do it	Njagala amanyi okukikola
I would love to help	Njagala nnyo okuyamba
I know how important it is	Nkimanyi nti kikulu nnyo
It’s really important.	Ddala kikulu nnyo.
Now he talks a lot.	Kati ayogera nnyo.
I know the phone will ring	Nkimanyi essimu ejja kuvuga
That is my position.	Ekyo kye kifo kyange.
I think we can do that	Ndowooza ekyo tusobola okukikola
He certainly had no reason to.	Mazima ddala yali talina nsonga yonna lwaki yali akola bw’atyo.
But this is not the point.	Naye eno si y’ensonga.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
Why are you doing that.	Lwaki okola ekyo.
And we’re there.	Era tuli awo.
It’s easy for me.	Kyangu gyendi.
I didn’t know what to say again	Nnali simanyi kya kuddamu kwogera
Soon.	Mangu ddala.
He was such a beautiful little boy!.	Yali mwana muto omulungi ennyo!.
You could have done whatever you wanted.	Wandibadde okola kyonna ky’oyagala.
Certainly there is.	Mazima ddala waliwo.
He says you won’t be able to.	Agamba nti tojja kusobola.
It’s not that.	Si ekyo.
For the most part this is true.	Okusinga kino kituufu.
I didn’t know what to do	Nali simanyi kya kukola
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
You can do it too.	Naawe osobola.
But it will happen soon.	Naye kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono.
I'm going to help.	Ngenda kuyamba.
Or he knows who.	Oba amanyi ani.
I am going to try this.	Ngenda kugezaako kino.
You can do it in so many ways.	Osobola okukikola mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo.
I know you know who he is, who he is.	Nkimanyi nti omanyi ky’ali, ky’ali.
I really didn’t want to know.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kumanya.
He didn’t have to do that.	Ekyo yali talina kukikola.
I haven’t got anything	Nze sirina kye nfunye
She had no children.	Yali talina mwana.
I was there too.	Nze nange nnali.
I wasn’t good at all	Nze nali si mulungi n’akatono
I'm sorry, too.	Naawe nsonyiwa.
I couldn’t try to love	Nnali sisobola kugezaako kwagala
But he was here now.	Naye yali wano kati.
I wonder how they are now	Nze nneebuuza kati bwe bali
It is very	Kiri nnyo .
And no one knows why.	Era tewali amanyi lwaki.
He was a better person than she knew.	Yali muntu mulungi okusinga oyo gwe yali amanyi.
Here, you can read the entire issue.	Wano, osobola okusoma ensonga yonna.
I didn’t know how to do this	Kino nnali simanyi ngeri ya kukikola
He didn't want someone like that in his house.	Yali tayagala muntu nga oyo mu nnyumba ye.
I love it, that’s mine	Njagala nnyo, ekyo kyange
He needed food, and fast.	Yali yeetaaga emmere, era nga ya bwangu.
I’m afraid there’s nothing at all.	Ntya nti tewali kintu kyonna n’akatono.
I wasn’t really sure what he was here to do	Mu butuufu nnali sikakasa kye yali wano okukola
Everything is just fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi nnyo.
No, it was just fine.	Nedda, kyali kirungi kyokka.
It is truly excellent work.	Mazima ddala mulimu mulungi nnyo.
I know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi.
I was actually a little nervous	Mu butuufu nnali ntya katono
I could hardly believe it	Nnali sisobola bulungi kukkiriza
I'm glad he's happy.	Ndi musanyufu nti musanyufu.
We have nothing now.	Tetulina kye tulina kati.
In any place.	Mu kifo kyonna.
I hope we’ll be okay	Nsuubira nti tujja kuba bulungi
That’s the idea.	Ekyo kye kirowoozo.
Reading is a powerful thing.	Okusoma kintu kya maanyi.
I was feeling alone	Nali mpulira nga ndi nzekka
I work quickly.	Nkola mangu.
I won’t know.	Sijja kumanya.
My point, it’s not.	Ensonga yange, si ye.
That’s good, of course.	Ekyo kirungi, ddala.
I want to drive in one	Njagala okuvuga mu emu
He doesn’t have anything.	Talina ky’alina.
For us this is what it is.	Ffe kino kye kiri.
There is no one.	Tewali muntu yenna.
Who is he?.	Ye ani?.
Not with him, anyway.	Si naye, mu ngeri yonna.
I will never be there again	Sijja kuddamu kubeerawo
I didn’t know you were there	Nnali simanyi nti oli awo
What is the problem? 	Kiki ekizibu?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I know it well enough.	Nze nkimanyi bulungi.
But we definitely have a plan.	Naye mazima ddala tulina enteekateeka.
This was his night.	Kino kye kyali ekiro kye.
Even.	Wadde.
I couldn’t do it, not now	Nnali sisobola kukikola, si kati
I won’t be alone for long	Sijja kubeera nzekka okumala ebbanga ddene
Without anyone’s help.	Nga tewali buyambi bwa muntu yenna.
That won’t happen.	Ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
Very nice guy.	Omulungi ennyo.
I want to be gay	Njagala kubeera muganzi
That’s what he wanted to be.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala okuba.
But it was there.	Naye kyali awo.
I probably do the same thing myself	Oboolyawo nange kennyini nkola ekintu kye kimu
He is a little younger than me.	Asinga nze muto katono.
He is one of us.	Ye omu ku ffe.
And he goes away.	Era agenda.
You can’t go home.	Tosobola kudda waka.
He is a lovely person.	Ye muntu ayagala ennyo.
Yeah, yeah.	Ye ye.
I thought it would be easy.	Nalowooza nti kijja kuba kyangu.
It’s the job.	Gwe mulimu.
That was my whole idea	Eyo ye yali ndowooza yange yonna
He was an only child and it was so easy.	Yali mwana omu yekka era nga kyangu nnyo.
He is the one we need.	Ye gwe twetaaga.
This is not what it is.	Kino si kye kiri.
Not at the moment.	Si mu kiseera kino.
But there isn’t.	Naye tewali.
No one has ever done this before.	Kino tewali abadde akikola.
I just need a little time.	Nze nneetaaga akaseera katono.
A .	Omu .
You’re not going to be there very long.	Togenda kubeerawo bbanga ddene nnyo.
I will definitely buy from them again!.	Mazima ddala nja kuddamu okugula okuva gye bali!.
I wondered if he knew	Nneebuuza oba yali amanyi
He did, he said.	Yakikola, bwe yagambye.
He thinks no.	Alowooza nti nedda.
I had no one to answer to	Nnali sirina gwe nnyinza kuddamu
I know whatever it is, it’s not true	Nkimanyi kyonna kye kiri, si kituufu
It won’t be good.	Tekijja kuba kirungi.
If he was alone, everything would be so much easier.	Singa yali yekka, buli kimu kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
I know that he knows	Nkimanyi nti amanyi
I know what to expect	Nze mmanyi kye nsuubira
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I’m working there.	Nze nkola eyo.
They are in this situation.	Bali mu mbeera eno.
Me, the guy.	Nze, ggaayi.
I want one.	Njagala emu.
For all he knew, he thought it was true.	Ku byonna bye yali amanyi, yalowooza nti kyali kituufu.
A job that someone else didn’t want	Omulimu omuntu omulala gwe yali tayagala
He would have been with her.	Yandibadde naye.
But he is still human.	Naye akyali muntu.
I was nobody.	Nze nali siri muntu yenna.
I honestly can’t tell.	Mu butuufu sisobola kumanya.
I hope he is okay	Nsuubira nti talina buzibu
I might go home soon.	Nnyinza okudda awaka amangu ddala.
I really didn’t want to talk to him	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kwogera naye
Surely who he was.	Mazima ddala yali ani.
He went home.	Yagenda awaka.
And then that was happening.	Era awo ekyo nga kigenda mu maaso.
I have to move on	Nnina okugenda mu maaso
However, the picture is not as simple as that.	Kyokka ekifaananyi si kyangu nga ekyo.
I know what we need to do	Nze mmanyi kye twetaaga okukola
Everything is just as it is.	Buli kimu kiri nga bwe kiri kyokka.
I wanted to know what he was thinking	Nnali njagala okumanya kye yali alowooza
Almost everyone has a car.	Kumpi buli muntu alina mmotoka.
No, not really.	Nedda, si ddala.
Maybe he already had.	Mpozzi yalina dda.
It was very real.	Kyali kya ddala nnyo.
You should have been sure.	Wandibadde okakasa nti.
I wish that wouldn’t happen	Njagala ekyo tekijja kubaawo
My brother did that.	Muganda wange ekyo yakikola.
I'm going to.	Nze ngenda ku...
He has to go.	Alina okugenda.
I can’t believe he would do that	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ekyo yandikoze
And it was the same.	Era bwe kyali.
We need a job.	Twetaaga omulimu.
Either way, it’s happening.	Mu ngeri yonna, kigenda mu maaso.
Not nearly enough to go on.	Si kumpi kumala kugenda mu maaso.
I thought that was good.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi.
I know someone like that	Nze mmanyi omuntu nga oyo
I couldn’t do anything.	Nnali sirina kye nsobola kukola.
Someone like me.	Omuntu nga nze.
I'll be fine.	Nja kuba bulungi.
I didn’t know he was with you	Nnali simanyi nti yali naawe
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali siyinza kukikola.
He didn't know the answer.	Yali tamanyi kya kuddamu.
Apparently you don’t.	Kirabika tolina.
But he loves it.	Naye ayagala nnyo.
And he .	Era ye .
I know what we have to do	Nze mmanyi kye tulina okukola
But that was it.	Naye ekyo kye kyali.
The concept in this is really good.	Endowooza eri mu kino ddala nnungi.
You really should talk to him.	Ddala wandibadde okwogera naye.
He wants to help.	Ayagala kuyamba.
I might get that one	Nnyinza okufuna oyo
I kind of like the guy	Nze mu ngeri ya njagala ggaayi
I hope everyone is okay	Nsuubira buli omu ali bulungi
This was going to be difficult.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kizibu.
I didn’t know you were coming	Nnali simanyi nti ojja
He is a good player.	Muzannyi mulungi.
However, I loved it anyway	Kyokka, nnali njagala nnyo mu ngeri yonna
I could only imagine how much he had on me	Nnali nsobola okulowooza ku bungi bwe yalina ku nze
I can’t wait to come together	Siyinza kulinda kujja wamu
I needed to do this	Kino nnali nneetaaga okukola
I couldn't see what situation he was in	Nnali sisobola kulaba mbeera ki gye yali mu
He is a wonderful father.	Ye taata mulungi nnyo.
Don't even go back.	Togenda wadde okuddamu.
Not immediately, but soon.	Si mangu ddala, naye mu bbanga ttono.
He is not my brother.	Si muganda wange.
He was on the youngest.	Yali ku muto.
No one came but him.	Tewali yajja okuggyako ye.
But no one wants to do something complicated.	Naye tewali ayagala kukola kintu kizibu.
I will not do this.	Kino sijja kukikola.
Herein lies the problem.	Wano we wali ekizibu.
It’s a beautiful night.	Ekiro kirungi nnyo.
No one was happy at the time.	Tewali yali musanyufu mu kiseera ekyo.
This is a great option.	Eno nkola nnungi nnyo.
But I won’t let that happen.	Naye ekyo sijja kukkiriza kubaawo.
I can't.	Sisobola.
I didn’t want to be there.	Nnali saagala kubeerawo.
I said we would do it	Nagamba nti tujja kukikola
At this point, he has to think.	Mu kiseera kino, alina okulowooza.
I think we’ll be fine.	Ndowooza tujja kuba bulungi.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
. . . .	.
I hope it’s not serious.	Nsuubira nti si kya maanyi.
I am so blessed to have you as my wife	Ndi wa mukisa nnyo okubeera naawe nga mukyala wange
He is beautiful.	Abeera mulungi.
She was young and beautiful.	Yali muto era nga mulungi nnyo.
Of course, he thought.	Kya lwatu, yalowooza.
I knew exactly what he was going to say	Nali mmanyi bulungi kye yali agenda okwogera
Everything is in place.	Buli kimu kiri mu kifo.
He loves his job.	Ayagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
He was a child.	Ye yali mwana.
I need to talk to mine	Nze nneetaaga okwogera ne wange
This will be just fine.	Kino kijja kuba bulungi nnyo.
You are fine and you are going to stay fine.	Oli bulungi era ogenda kusigala bulungi.
We have tomorrow.	Tulina enkya.
That at this point, obviously, wasn’t the case.	Ekyo mu kiseera kino, kirabika si bwe yali.
But not for long.	Naye si lwa bbanga ddene.
But it looks good.	Naye kirabika bulungi.
I love making these.	Njagala nnyo okukola bino.
Perhaps that was the problem.	Oboolyawo ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
I was a teacher, you know.	Nze nali musomesa, omanyi.
I need some help.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi.
I have to go do something.	Nnina okugenda okukola ekintu.
I needed to get out of here	Nnali nneetaaga okuva wano
This is mine.	Kino kyange.
He wants to talk to you right now.	Ayagala okwogera naawe mu kiseera kino.
However, probably not you or me.	Kyokka osanga si ggwe oba nze.
I can’t go to jail	Sisobola kugenda mu kkomera
And it was just that.	Era kyali kyokka.
I thought you were this good	Nnalowooza nti kino oli mulungi
I hoped he knew that	Nnali nsuubira nti ekyo yali akimanyi
Of course, now .	Kya lwatu nti kati .
No reason really.	Tewali nsonga yonna ddala.
But in reality, this is not the case.	Naye mu butuufu, kino si bwe kiri.
This is not for this week.	Kino si kya wiiki eno.
I know you are a busy man	Nkimanyi oli musajja bbize
I'll have to see what happens	Nja kuba nnina okulaba ekigenda okubaawo
He has an opinion on everything.	Alina endowooza ku buli kimu.
I need to talk to him	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye
That will do for now.	Ekyo kijja kukola ku kiseera kino.
That’s a terrible thing.	Ekyo kibi nnyo.
It was the same like every week.	Kyali kye kimu nga buli wiiki.
It’s hard to go, you know.	Kizibu okugenda, omanyi.
He was my everything.	Yali buli kimu kyange.
Both together, in my house.	Bombi nga bali wamu, mu nnyumba yange.
You can do it too.	Naawe oyinza okukikola.
Think.	Okulowooza.
But we’re all fine now.	Naye ffenna tuli bulungi kati.
He just wanted to be with his girlfriend.	Yali ayagala kubeera ne muganzi we kyokka.
So he goes away.	Bwatyo agenda.
It’s easy, of course.	Kyangu, ddala.
Strong, he was mighty.	Nga wa maanyi, yali wa maanyi nnyo.
We’re here, baby.	Ffe wano mwana.
I thought we were, anyway	Nalowooza nti twali, mu ngeri yonna
I wanted to be an artist	Nnali njagala kubeera muyimbi
I’m sure there’s nothing.	Nkakasa nti tewali kintu kyonna.
I wonder how much he goes for	Nze nneebuuza nti agenda ku ssente mmeka
This was a real problem, in my opinion.	Kino kyali kizibu ddala, mu ndowooza yange.
That would be great to see.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo okulaba.
I'm thinking about the problem	Nze ndowooza ku buzibu
And now this is who he is to us.	Era kati kino ky’ali gye tuli.
I knew it was him	Nali mmanyi nti ye ye
Of course, it was true.	Kya lwatu, kyali kituufu.
Nothing mattered except his job.	Tewali kyali kikulu okuggyako omulimu gwe.
I’m just his friend	Nze mukwano gwe yekka
I thought he must be my dad.	Nalowooza nti ateekwa okuba nga ye taata wange.
For me it comes and goes.	Nze kijja ne kigenda.
No one is speaking.	Tewali ayogera.
Being human is not human.	Okubeera omuntu si muntu.
You will certainly do it.	Mazima ddala ojja kukikola.
Actually this is not true.	Mu butuufu kino si kituufu.
However, that was coming.	Kyokka ekyo kyali kijja.
I will work with you.	Nja kukola naawe.
You are very good at this.	Oli mulungi nnyo ku kino.
The best is the speed.	Asinga ye bwangu.
From week to week.	Okuva wiiki okudda ku wiiki.
That's you.	Oyo ggwe.
I expected it to be serious	Nali nsuubira nti yali ya maanyi
Probably everyone does.	Oboolyawo buli muntu akikola.
It can be a job.	Kiyinza okuba omulimu.
I love everyone in this group.	Njagala nnyo buli muntu mu kibiina kino.
My friend lives here now	Mukwano gwange abeera wano kati
I don’t know if he did.	Simanyi oba yakikola.
I was thinking, if you know	Nali ndowooza, singa oba omanyi
I don’t know why, really.	Simanyi lwaki, ddala.
It’s easy to do.	Kyangu okukola.
I may know what that is.	Nnyinza okuba nga mmanyi ekyo kye kiri.
Just like at home.	Nga awaka bwe bali.
No time for that.	Tewali budde bwa ekyo.
I want to be a teacher	Njagala kubeera musomesa
I was very busy at work today	Leero nnali bbize nnyo ku mulimu
You can do this.	Kino osobola okukikola.
He wasn’t going to do that.	Ekyo yali tagenda kukikola.
But he could have.	Naye yali asobola.
But, as it is.	Naye, nga bwe kiri.
Just that one thing.	Ekintu ekyo kimu kyokka.
I can’t live this way	Siyinza kubeera mu ngeri eno
I doubt that it is.	Nbuusabuusa nti bwe kiri.
I’m willing to do anything.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola ekintu kyonna.
I could do better, be better.	Nnali nsobola okukola obulungi, okubeera obulungi.
I was there alone with no money	Nali eyo nzekka nga sirina ssente
But he didn't know what to do.	Naye yali tamanyi kya kukola.
This is not true.	Kino si kya mazima.
I guess you look good	Ntebereza nti olabika bulungi
That is a very, very serious point.	Eyo nsonga ya maanyi nnyo nnyo.
Maybe you can, but this is not for me.	Mpozzi osobola naye kino si kyange.
You never know what’s going to happen.	Tomanyi kigenda kubaawo.
In fact, he must have.	Mu butuufu, ateekwa okuba nga yakikola.
He is better than that.	Ye asinga ekyo.
I honestly can’t believe it	Mu butuufu siyinza kukkiriza
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
That’s not the case with this one.	Ekyo si bwe kiri ku kino.
And no one can be like him.	Era tewali ayinza kuba nga ye.
I just hope he’s okay	Nsuubira kyokka nti ali bulungi
This is where the problem lies.	Wano obuzibu we buli.
I knew he was a good person	Nali nkimanyi nti muntu mulungi
I really don’t have anything	Mazima ddala sirina kye nnina
And he doing it now.	Era ye nga akikola kati.
And there are dogs everywhere.	Era buli wamu waliwo embwa.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
I was thinking of all that	Ebyo byonna nnali ndowooza
He talks about his teacher all the time.	Ayogera ku musomesa we buli kiseera.
And this was good.	Era kino kyali kirungi.
He really does.	Ddala akikola.
This will be important soon.	Kino kijja kuba kikulu mu bbanga ttono.
And it’s very easy to do.	Era kyangu nnyo okukola.
Not everyone is like that.	Si buli muntu nti bw’atyo.
It doesn’t matter.	Si nsonga.
It’s really important.	Ddala kikulu nnyo.
He thought that was true.	Yalowooza nti ekyo kyali kituufu.
But it’s not really that.	Naye mu butuufu si ekyo.
No, it really is.	Nedda, ddala bwe kiri.
That won’t work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola.
Not that he really wanted to.	Si nti ddala yali ayagala.
I want to get back to that	Njagala kudda ku ekyo
I always loved it there	Bulijjo nnali njagala nnyo eyo
That was a terrible thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi nnyo.
I want it here too	Njagala wano nange
I love being home	Njagala nnyo okubeera awaka
You don’t want any of that.	Toyagala tewali na kimu ku ebyo.
That’s true for everyone.	Ekyo kituufu buli muntu.
I thought you’d want to know	Nalowooza nti ojja kwagala okumanya
And he does everything for money.	Era buli kimu akikola lwa ssente.
But, well, we can’t do that.	Naye, bulungi, ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
That’s what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu nnyo.
And that’s where the beauty lies.	Era awo we wali obulungi.
I want to do everything I do	Njagala kukola buli kye nkola
You will be with me.	Ojja kuba nange.
He could talk about anything	Yali asobola okwogera ku nsonga yonna
I knew that, but he knew that	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi, naye ekyo yali akimanyi
I knew nothing could happen	Namanya nti tewali kiyinza kubaawo
He started working.	Yatandika okukola...
I thought he was already gone	Nalowooza nti yali yagenda dda
He's just a kid.	Ye mwana muto yekka.
He is doing well right now.	Akola bulungi mu kiseera kino.
Effort.	Amaanyi.
However, he would if he had to.	Kyokka, yandikoze singa yali alina okukikola.
There is no truth.	Tewali mazima.
This, of course, is the case.	Kino, ddala, bwe kiri.
You can come back to us.	Osobola okudda gye tuli.
I love it more than I do	Njagala nnyo okusinga nze
Everyone has a phone.	Buli muntu alina essimu.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
He is my father.	Ye taata wange.
I can’t say what it was	Siyinza kwogera kiki kye kyali
He is an artist in his own right	Muyimbi mu ngeri ye
I really needed this.	Kino nnali nneetaaga nnyo.
But it’s hard to live with him.	Naye kizibu okubeera naye.
No job, no wife.	Tewali mulimu, tewali mukyala.
I didn’t want to though	Nnali saagala wadde
You make a movie, everyone has an opinion.	Okola firimu, buli omu alina endowooza.
I really don’t think it matters.	Mu butuufu sirowooza nti kikulu.
I don’t know well at all	Nze simanyi bulungi n’akatono
And from there.	Era okuva awo.
And he knows it.	Era akimanyi.
Now that’s a thing.	Kati ekyo kintu.
He is a person who lives alone.	Ye muntu abeera yekka.
I was nervous at the time too	Nange mu kiseera ekyo nnali ntya
A lot like you, in a way	Bingi nga ggwe, mu ngeri emu
He had it now.	Yalina kati.
I wanted a good person	Nnali njagala omuntu omulungi
This is not an opportunity.	Guno si mukisa.
I think you can go home now	Ndowooza osobola okudda eka kati
However, there is a problem with this.	Kyokka kino waliwo obuzibu.
No one knew where they were.	Tewali yali amanyi gye baali.
Of course, he does.	Kya lwatu nti akola bw’atyo.
I was always happy alone	Bulijjo nnali musanyufu nzekka
He is very much the problem.	Ye nnyo ekizibu.
In fact, they are one.	Mu butuufu, bali kimu.
I have been lucky.	Mbadde wa mukisa.
I think he would be very nice to you	Ndowooza yandibadde mulungi nnyo gy’oli
That you could do something like that.	Nti oyinza okukola ekintu ng’ekyo.
I wanted to eat one.	Nnali njagala okulya emu.
I want to be a guy who gets things done	Njagala kubeera ggaayi akola ebintu
I can’t do that, not right now	Ekyo sisobola kukikola, si mu kiseera kino
I really have no problem	Mazima ddala sirina buzibu
And that was important to me.	Era ekyo kyali kikulu gyendi.
I'll stay here.	Nja kusigala wano.
Actually, that would be nice.	Mu butuufu, ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
He could do anything.	Yali asobola okukola buli kimu.
I didn’t know if you knew	Nali simanyi oba omanyi
I was afraid of this	Kino nnali ntya
A really good one, too	Omulungi ddala, naye
I was supposed to be there an hour ago	Nali wa kubeerawo essaawa emu emabega
However, that is not true.	Kyokka, ekyo si kituufu.
I am ready, in many ways.	Ndi mwetegefu, mu ngeri nnyingi.
I think, but whatever	Ndowooza, naye kyonna
But you can’t do that in a room like this.	Naye ekyo tosobola kukikola mu kisenge nga kino.
He said he needed to eat.	Yagambye nti yeetaaga okulya.
He has a point though.	Alina ensonga wadde.
I've been thinking about it	Mbadde ndowooza ku nsonga eyo
It may or may not be the same thing.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu kye kimu oba nedda.
Almost, but not quite.	Kumpi, naye si ddala.
Someone has to eat.	Omuntu alina okulya.
This was completely normal.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo ddala.
All the time, everywhere.	Buli kiseera, buli wamu.
I'm not sure anyone does.	Sikakasa nti waliwo akola.
I will do the same.	Nange nja kukola kye kimu.
This is almost in.	Kino kiri kumpi mu.
I was just hoping for that	Ekyo nnali nsuubira kyokka
I want him.	Njagala ye.
You don’t know, anyway.	Tomanyi, mu ngeri yonna.
I will never do anything like that again.	Sijja kuddamu kukola kintu kyonna ng’ekyo.
Everyone has an opinion.	Buli muntu alina endowooza.
Of course, this is not always the case.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri bulijjo.
No, you can’t come with me, dog.	Nedda, tosobola kujja nange, embwa.
How are you going to proceed?.	Ogenda kugenda otya mu maaso?.
And it’s difficult.	Era kizibu.
I have no one but him	Sirina muntu yenna okuggyako ye
I wanted to know how you were	Nali njagala okumanya nga naawe bwe wali
It really is so much.	Ddala bingi nnyo.
I can only imagine the look on his face	Nsobola okulowooza ku ngeri gye yali alabika mu maaso
Apparently he doesn’t have to go to work today.	Kirabika leero talina kugenda kukola.
It’s all about him.	Byonna ku ye.
I need more alone time	Nze nneetaaga obudde bungi nga ndi nzekka
It wasn’t what he expected.	Si kye yali asuubira.
He was just very much a man.	Yali musajja nnyo yekka.
I can’t work in this situation	Sisobola kukola mu mbeera eno
Getting the money.	Okufuna ssente.
This is a very dangerous practice.	Eno nkola ya bulabe nnyo.
He saw the whole thing.	Yalaba ekintu kyonna.
He certainly wasn't going to say anything.	Mazima ddala yali tagenda kwogera kintu kyonna.
He would need time for this.	Kino yandibadde yeetaaga obudde.
I don’t really want a relationship with anyone	Mu butuufu saagala mukwano na muntu yenna
I knew it was good.	Namanya nti kirungi.
We need this.	Kino twetaaga.
Here we are.	Wano we tuli.
I knew exactly what he was capable of	Nnali mmanyi bulungi kye yali asobola
But that certainly wasn’t the thinking at the time.	Naye mazima ddala eyo si ye yali ndowooza mu kiseera ekyo.
He is one of us now.	Ye omu ku ffe kati.
What we were to each other.	Bye twali eri buli omu.
I, too, wonder.	Nange, nneebuuza.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
I didn’t want to, of course	Nnali saagala, ddala
He needed to get to them.	Yali yeetaaga okutuuka gye bali.
Lucky to be with him.	Omukisa okubeera naye.
I have the impression that it is	Nnina endowooza nti bwe kiri
I really need to talk to you.	Nze ddala nneetaaga okwogera naawe.
I wasn’t quite sure why	Nnali sikakasa nnyo lwaki
But he couldn’t do it.	Naye yali tasobola kukikola.
If he went away.	Singa yagenda.
However, he couldn’t find much.	Kyokka, yali tasobola kufuna bingi.
I know what he needs to do	Nze mmanyi kye yeetaaga okukola
No one came forward.	Tewali yajja mu maaso.
I know he has wanted this for a very long time	Nkimanyi kino abadde ayagala okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo
I didn’t really know who he was	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi ani
I love the job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
I was terrified myself	Nze kennyini nnali ntya nnyo
Why would he do it.	Lwaki yandikoze.
He really did it.	Ddala yakikola.
But it’s not a plan.	Naye si nteekateeka.
I knew from there that we would have a problem	Namanya okuva awo nti tujja kufuna ekizibu
But that was what was going to happen.	Naye ekyo kye kyali kigenda okubaawo.
All but one.	Byonna okuggyako omu.
Although, of course, he can’t.	Wadde nga, kya lwatu, tasobola.
And it was very easy.	Era kyali kyangu nnyo.
I was his friend	Nze nali mukwano gwe
I love doing it	Njagala nnyo okukikola
I just like to say that	Nze njagala nnyo okwogera ekyo kyokka
Good, he said.	Kirungi, bwe yagambye.
I was basically indifferent to the conceptual work	Okusinga nnali sifaayo ku mulimu gwa ndowooza
I don’t want to wait.	Saagala kulinda.
I wanted to stay with him	Nnali njagala kusigala naye
Neither this, nor that.	Nedda kino, nedda ekyo.
He somehow knew it.	Yalina engeri gye yali akimanyi.
I'm not sure what to make of that.	Sikakasa kya kukola ku ekyo.
Maybe he wanted to.	Mpozzi nga yali ayagala.
I am ready to leave this place.	Ndi mwetegefu okuva mu kifo kino.
I am not good in this situation.	Siri mulungi mu mbeera eno.
Now he is not the thing.	Kati si ye kintu.
He knows what reading is.	Amanyi okusoma kye ki.
He was involved himself.	Ye kennyini yali mu nsonga eno.
He wasn’t, but he was.	Yali si bwe yali, naye ye yali.
I love it here.	Njagala nnyo wano.
Working here and there.	Okukola wano ne wali.
I had no idea why that might be	Nnali simanyi lwaki ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri
It's not the point.	Si y'ensonga.
He can’t be alone.	Tasobola kubeera yekka.
You make a move.	Okola ekintu ekigenda mu maaso.
I deserved nothing more	Tewali kintu kyonna kye nnali nsaanidde okusinga ekyo
I would love to spend time with him again	Njagala nnyo okuddamu okumala naye obudde
You know, of course.	Omanyi, ddala.
I couldn’t be happier	Nnali siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo
He knew who he was.	Yali amanyi ani gwe yali.
It was time to have everything.	Kyali kiseera kya kubeera na buli kimu.
But there is .	Naye waliwo .
I think this is a very dangerous place	Ndowooza kino kifo kya bulabe nnyo
We are love.	Ffe tuli kwagala.
I was hoping to get to town	Nali nsuubira okutuuka mu kibuga
I was curious about it	Nnali njagala nnyo okumanya ku nsonga eyo
This is a good one.	Eno nnungi.
I can’t believe how many there are	Siyinza kukkiriza nti waliwo mmeka
I wonder what they are	Nze nneebuuza kye bali
He could do this better.	Kino yali asobola okukola obulungi.
He loves it so much.	Ayagala nnyo.
And you can do it.	Era oyinza okukikola.
But it is not for us to say when.	Naye si ffe okwogera ddi.
He was there, he was there.	Yali awo, yali awo.
I can’t be human anymore	Sisobola kuddamu kubeera muntu
I thought he knew better	Nalowooza nti yali asinga okumanya
I wasn’t sure why we were here	Nali sikakasa lwaki twali wano
I’m so scared.	Nze ntya nnyo.
It was his idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kye.
And you, perhaps.	Naawe mpozzi.
It may just be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri kyokka.
It was for a child, of course.	Yali ya mwana, ddala.
Nothing is too complicated.	Tewali kizibu nnyo.
But he was just one man.	Naye yali musajja omu yekka.
And they are friends.	Era ba mukwano.
Until he is.	Okutuusa nga ye.
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okukikola.
He had to know.	Yalina okumanya.
I prove my point.	Nkakasa ensonga yange.
This is a bad idea in any case.	Kino kirowoozo kibi mu mbeera yonna.
But of course it wasn’t.	Naye ddala si bwe yali.
I don’t have a child.	Nze sirina mwana.
Honestly, it was a bad time.	Mu butuufu, kyali kiseera kibi.
I don't want to.	Saagala.
I have a friend who lives there	Nnina mukwano gwange abeera eyo
I have to stay for a long time	Nnina okumala ebbanga ddene
I need to talk to you now	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe kati
You can do it yourself.	Ggwe kennyini osobola okukikola.
It was anything he knew all too well.	Kyali kintu kyonna kye yali amanyi obulungi ennyo.
Maybe this will work out better.	Mpozzi kino kijja kukola obulungi.
One of us, always.	Omu ku ffe, bulijjo.
Now he is near you.	Kati ali kumpi naawe.
I need to do it	Nze nneetaaga okukikola
I think he probably knew why	Ndowooza osanga yali amanyi lwaki
I think this is a good thing	Ndowooza kino kintu kirungi
I’m ready to work.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola.
He's fine.	Ali bulungi.
I need to go with you	Nze nneetaaga okugenda naawe
It’s not really true.	Mu butuufu si kituufu.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
I don’t want to keep living without you.	Saagala kusigala nga mbeera nga tolina.
I guess he just wanted to stay in the system.	Ntebereza nti yali ayagala nnyo kusigala mu nkola.
I can do that	Ekyo nsobola okukikola
This was probably true.	Kino oboolyawo kyali kituufu.
You’re not too busy.	Toli bbize nnyo.
But it’s not me.	Naye si nze.
I wanted to help.	Nnali njagala okuyamba.
He will do whatever you want.	Ajja kukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
It was absolutely true.	Kyali kituufu ddala.
I didn’t know where, how, he lived	Nali simanyi wa, ngeri ki, gye yali abeera
I want to get home as soon as we can	Njagala kudda waka mangu nga bwe tusobola
I just need a little drive out of town	Nze nneetaaga kuvuga katono okuva mu kibuga
We can’t play too much, we can’t try too hard.	Tetusobola kuzannya nnyo, tetusobola kugezaako nnyo.
That feels so good	Ekyo mpulira bulungi nnyo
Not now, not ever.	Si kati, si mu kiseera kyonna.
You won’t have to say anything.	Tojja kuba na kwogera kintu kyonna.
I couldn’t believe he was going with me	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti yali agenda nange
No one is here.	Tewali muntu yenna ali wano.
Of course, he couldn't drive anywhere.	Kya lwatu nti yali tasobola kuvuga yonna.
He knew it, of course.	Yali akimanyi, ddala.
It was very accurate.	Kyali kituufu nnyo.
I hope it doesn’t come to that	Nsuubira nti tekijja ku ekyo
It is a very serious problem.	Kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
He was obviously interested.	Kya lwatu nti yali ayagala nnyo.
I wasn’t good at it	Nze nali simanyi bulungi mu nsonga eyo
He will want to know.	Ajja kwagala okumanya.
And he wasn’t dangerous.	Era yali si wa bulabe.
I knew exactly who he was	Nnali mmanyi ddala ani gwe yali
In no way could I do anything about it	Mu ngeri yonna nnali sisobola kukikola kintu kyonna
I had no idea about this	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku nsonga eno
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo
He had been here a week.	Yali amaze wano wiiki emu.
But he comes to me .	Naye ajja gyendi .
But what do I know.	Naye kiki kye mmanyi.
However, I have to go.	Kyokka nnina okugenda.
However, I have to go.	Kyokka nnina okugenda.
I couldn’t see why he couldn’t stay longer	Nnali sisobola kulaba lwaki yali tasobola kumala bbanga ddene
Now you should go.	Kati wandibadde ogenda.
I can work from home	Nsobola okukola nga ndi waka
I feel really good right now	Mpulira bulungi ddala mu kiseera kino
He couldn’t always be by her side.	Bulijjo yali tasobola kubeera ku ludda lwe.
We’re fine, we’re fine.	Tuli bulungi, tuli bulungi.
I will buy everything.	Nja kugula buli kimu.
There is no reason to take sides.	Tewali nsonga lwaki olina kudda ku ludda.
Or this week.	Oba wiiki eno.
I could talk to him .	Nnali nsobola okwogera naye .
I do everything.	Buli kimu nkola.
In the circumstances, this was true.	Mu mbeera, kino kyali kituufu.
He looked like him.	Yali alabika nga ye.
You are a good man.	Oli musajja mulungi.
He could do anything, but this.	Yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna, naye kino.
He is not that kind of person.	Si muntu wa ngeri eyo.
I am not a human being.	Nze siri muntu yenna.
And you can, too.	Era naawe osobola.
Like him.	Nga ye.
I think they’re on to me	Ndowooza bali ku nze
My father has the same thing	Taata alina ekintu kye kimu
I will not allow something to happen again	Sijja kukkiriza kintu kuddamu kubaawo
I wonder how he is	Nze nneebuuza nti ali atya
I don’t think it’s the same now.	Sirowooza nti kati kye kimu.
Now I knew this was mine	Kati nnali nkimanyi nti kino kyange
I have a way of doing things	Nnina engeri gye nkola ebintu
I thought he was done talking to me	Nalowooza nti yali amaze okwogera nange
I think you might be that player	Ndowooza oyinza okuba nga gwe muzannyi oyo
Not really himself.	Mu butuufu si ye kennyini.
We need to do this.	Kino twetaaga okukikola.
I think that’s a good idea	Ndowooza ekyo kirowoozo kirungi
It's dangerous.	Kya bulabe.
To move forward.	Okugenda mu maaso.
I know you were with him	Nkimanyi nti wali naye
That was the right thing to do.	Ekyo kyali kituufu.
And that's it.	Era ekyo.
I really don’t want to talk about it	Mu butuufu saagala kwogera ku nsonga eno
Either one or both of us.	Oba omu oba ffembi.
He was happy happy.	Yali musanyufu nga musanyufu.
I'll come.	Nja kujja.
It was a very difficult time.	Kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
I didn’t really know what it was	Nze nali simanyi bulungi kye kyali
Felt.	Yawulira.
I think that’s very important	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo
I'll go on thinking.	Nja kugenda mu maaso nga ndowooza.
Getting it is good.	Okufuna kirungi.
I knew who, though	Kyokka nnali mmanyi ani
I’m not going to.	Nze sigenda.
He goes down easy.	Agenda wansi nga kyangu.
Not a bad idea for a movie.	Si kirowoozo kibi ku firimu.
I think that’s true.	Ndowooza ekyo kituufu.
It was always a problem.	Bulijjo kyali kizibu.
Too many hours.	Ssaawa nnyingi nnyo.
I just didn’t want to	Nze nnali saagala kyokka
He has power in him.	Alina amaanyi mu ye.
You don’t have very long.	Tolina bbanga ddene nnyo.
the father said.	taata bwe yagamba.
I was terrified myself	Nze kennyini nnali ntya nnyo
Maybe you want to do the same.	Mpozzi naawe oyagala okukola kye kimu.
Tomorrow, but my office.	Enkya, naye ofiisi yange.
It will be very important.	Kijja kuba kikulu nnyo.
I know you don’t want to do this	Nkimanyi nti kino toyagala kukola
I was actually afraid to see my father	Mu butuufu nnali ntya okulaba taata
That won’t happen.	Ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
I could hear it in the room	Nnali mpulira mu kisenge
He went all in.	Yagenda byonna mu.
I will be ready.	Nja kuba mwetegefu.
That's why he's not sick or anything either.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki naye si mulwadde oba ekintu kyonna.
He was sick.	Yali mulwadde.
I wasn’t going with him	Nze nali sigenda naye
I didn’t know where he went	Nnali simanyi gye yagenda
We all have one.	Ffenna tulina emu.
Either way I was speechless	Mu ngeri yonna nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera
I was thinking the same thing before	Nze nali ndowooza kye kimu emabegako
I can’t be in the same room	Sisobola kubeera mu kisenge kimu
But now he did it.	Naye kati yakikola.
You need to know that you can too.	Olina okumanya nti naawe osobola.
He doesn’t even have a girlfriend.	Talina wadde muganzi.
I’ve had plenty of time to read	Nfunye obudde bungi okusoma
That's what he wants.	Ekyo ky'ayagala.
Maybe there’s someone there.	Mpozzi nga waliwo omuntu awo.
He didn't know how to answer that.	Ekyo yali tamanyi ngeri ya kuddamu.
And it isn’t.	Era si bwe kiri.
I thought it would be like	Nalowooza nti kyandibadde nga
I will back off, but not immediately	Nja kudda emabega, naye si mangu
He thinks a lot about you.	Alowooza nnyo ku ggwe.
She needed to talk to him.	Yali yeetaaga okwogera naye.
But you are one.	Naye ggwe oli omu.
He needed strength right now.	Yali yeetaaga amaanyi mu kiseera kino.
Anything.	Ekintu kyonna.
It was really beautiful.	Ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
He knew his stuff.	Yali amanyi ebintu bye.
I have a friend down there	Nnina mukwano gwange wansi awo
It wasn’t his house.	Si ye yali nnyumba ye.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
It was truly a beautiful place.	Mazima ddala kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
So far, it’s pretty simple.	N’okutuusa kati, kyangu nnyo.
I won’t even be here	Sijja na kubeera wano
But he thought carefully about it.	Naye yalowooza bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
This was the moment.	Kino kye kyali akaseera.
I have to get to work	Nnina okutuuka ku mulimu
Everyone is really friendly.	Buli muntu ddala wa mukwano.
I’m myself.	Nze kennyini.
It’s nice to talk.	Kirungi okwogera.
I didn’t know exactly	Nnali simanyi bulungi
I don’t want to be anything.	Saagala kubeera kintu kyonna.
I didn’t have the money.	Nnali sirina ssente.
Maybe that will help	Mpozzi ekyo kijja kuyamba
I was an ordinary person.	Nali muntu wa bulijjo.
I don’t know why.	Simanyi lwaki.
That would really be something.	Ekyo ddala kyandibadde kintu.
I hope to be back soon.	Nsuubira okudda mu bbanga ttono.
And he's not here, either.	Era tali wano, naye.
And you can’t go without it.	Era tosobola kugenda nga tolina.
I was feeling pretty good	Nali mpulira bulungi nnyo
However, that’s probably not what you want.	Kyokka, osanga ekyo si ky’oyagala.
But that’s a good thing.	Naye ekyo kirungi.
I really need to be here	Nneetaaga nnyo okubeera wano
I hope anyone else does the same	Nsuubira omuntu omulala yenna okukola kye kimu
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
In he’s coming.	Mu y’ajja.
He's not good.	Si mulungi.
I need to get out of here	Nze nneetaaga okuva wano
I will always be here	Nja kubeera wano bulijjo
I knew you would come here.	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kujja wano.
Like a city.	Nga kibuga.
I'm glad they're on.	Ndi musanyufu nti bali ku.
I know how to read.	Nze mmanyi okusoma.
He knew it was true.	Yali akimanyi nti kituufu.
He said it probably was.	Yagambye nti osanga bwe kyali.
He has been good to us.	Abadde mulungi gye tuli.
I won’t come with you	Sijja kujja naawe
I can't see anything is an issue here	Siyinza kulaba kintu kyonna nsonga wano
I have no problem with that.	Ekyo sirina buzibu bwonna.
I know what’s going on.	Nze mmanyi ekigenda mu maaso.
I already know what’s going on	Nze mmanyi dda ekigenda mu maaso
Not just for me, but for everyone.	Si nze nzekka, naye eri buli muntu.
You don’t know how.	Tomanyi ngeri ki.
I don't want to have to do this	Kino saagala kuba na kukola kino
Maybe this is luck.	Mpozzi kino kya mukisa.
But you have to be good.	Naye olina okuba omulungi.
That was pretty close, but .	Ekyo kyali kumpi nnyo, naye .
We’re going to see.	Tugenda kulaba.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
I am one and one is all	Nze ndi omu era omu ye byonna
I hope you will make it as well	Nsuubira nti ojja kukikola nga bwe kiri
I need to talk to him	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye
You are the one.	Ggwe oli omu.
And it’s probably on point.	Era osanga kiri ku nsonga.
I had no choice but to go as well	Nnali sirina kya kukola okuggyako okugenda nga nange
We are here, right now, right now.	Tuli wano, mu kiseera kino, mu kiseera kino.
That’s pretty easy.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo.
I should have talked to you sooner about it	Nnali nsaanidde okwogera naawe amangu ku nsonga eyo
I knew what was going on	Namanya ekigenda mu maaso
I love that movie.	Njagala nnyo firimu eyo.
I don't want to go into this	Kino saagala kugenda mu nsonga eno
I think that’s dangerous	Ndowooza ekyo kya bulabe
I know this isn’t always easy.	Nkimanyi nti kino si kyangu bulijjo.
It is a difficult time.	Kiseera kizibu.
I don’t want to talk about that	Ekyo saagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo
I had no plans on doing it either	Nange nnali sirina nteekateeka yonna ku kukikola
He really seems to know everyone.	Ddala alabika amanyi buli muntu.
But it’s not the same thing.	Naye si kintu kye kimu.
I was supposed to be working	Nze nnali nnina okuba nga nkola
What do you think?.	Ggwe olowooza ki?.
I was a player, just like you	Nze nali muzannyi, nga ggwe
It’s obvious why you’re here.	Kya lwatu lwaki oli wano.
Something is happening, and soon.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso, era mu bbanga ttono.
He does that every day.	Ekyo akikola buli lunaku.
Anyone but me.	Omuntu yenna okuggyako nze.
I have to get out of here	Nnina okuva wano
But he was a man.	Naye yali musajja.
Like a lot of it.	Nga nnyo.
I know it’s great	Nkimanyi nti kirungi nnyo
I want to eat someone here	Njagala kulya muntu wano
And on we go.	Era ku tugenda.
But he did, anyway.	Naye yakikola, mu ngeri yonna.
Everyone thinks so.	Buli omu alowooza bw’atyo.
One had to go to the hospital.	Omu yalina okugenda mu ddwaaliro.
I’m ready to go now.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okugenda kati.
He wanted to come.	Yali ayagala kujja.
And, and, and.	Era, era, era.
I think that’s the idea	Ndowooza ekyo kye kirowoozo
I need to go home though	Nze nneetaaga okudda eka wadde
You are very much like him.	Oli nga ye nnyo.
It’s really awful.	Ddala kibi nnyo.
But the same thing could happen next week.	Naye ekintu kye kimu kiyinza okubaawo wiiki ejja.
I can’t keep thinking about all this	Siyinza kusigala nga ndowooza ku bino byonna
He doesn’t want to do it.	Tayagala kukikola.
I wanted to talk about it	Nnali njagala okwogera ku nsonga eyo
And it is the same.	Era bwe kiri.
I need to get early on this and move on	Nze nneetaaga okufuna nga bukyali kino ne ngenda mu maaso
I had no idea who or what she was	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi nti ani oba kiki
For the best.	Okusinga obulungi.
I needed help	Nnali nneetaaga obuyambi
I knew there was no issue	Namanya nti tewali nsonga
That is not the case here.	Ekyo si bwe kiri wano.
I know this is true of me.	Nkimanyi nti kino kituufu ku nze.
I’ve been both of them.	Nze mbadde bombi.
I could have no idea what my job was	Nnali sisobola kuba na kirowoozo kyonna ku mulimu gwange
We are on the.	Tuli ku...
More than anything, he needed food.	Okusinga ekintu kyonna, yali yeetaaga emmere.
I don’t know if that’s true.	Simanyi oba ekyo kituufu.
I might have had it.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnali nfunye.
He is not here today.	Tali wano leero.
I probably won’t be home tonight	Oboolyawo ekiro kino sijja kudda waka
I feel good today, happy	Mpulira bulungi leero, nga ndi musanyufu
Actually, it was pretty good.	Mu butuufu, kyali kirungi nnyo.
And it always will.	Era bulijjo kijja kujja.
Perhaps they were.	Oboolyawo bwe baali.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
I can’t even see what’s down there	Sisobola na kulaba kiri wansi awo
I can’t have a relationship with a man	Sisobola kuba na mukwano na musajja
They really are.	Ddala bwe bali.
Maybe about three.	Mpozzi nga ssatu.
I just can’t.	Nze sisobola kyokka.
From the bottom.	Okuva wansi.
I want to see if he is home	Njagala kulaba oba ali waka
I don’t think that’s true though.	Sirowooza nti ekyo kituufu wadde.
I was so overwhelmed.	Nali nfunye obuzibu bungi nnyo.
I am a good doctor	Ndi musawo mulungi
Everyone has it.	Buli omu alina.
He is very aware of who he is.	Amanyi nnyo ky’ali.
He hasn’t done it yet.	Tannaba kukikola.
But this was terrible.	Naye kino kyali kibi nnyo.
He knew this.	Kino yali akimanyi.
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo nnyo
But he couldn't speak.	Naye yali tasobola kwogera.
I don’t think it matters.	Sirowooza nti kikulu.
She is his girlfriend.	Ye muganzi we.
I feel so much better moving forward	Mpulira bulungi nnyo okugenda mu maaso
I was convinced.	Nali nkakasa.
I’m making progress in a lot.	Nze ngenda mu maaso mu bingi.
I can’t do it though	Sisobola kukikola wadde
He was strong.	Yali wa maanyi.
But you are in the moment.	Naye ggwe oli mu kiseera kino.
I feel like everyone knows	Mpulira nga buli omu amanyi
I’m good now.	Nze ndi mulungi kati.
That’s how much he knew.	Bw’atyo bwe yali amanyi.
Speaking in the congregation.	Okwogera mu kibiina.
And this is not a good thing.	Era kino si kintu kirungi.
Not for long though.	Si lwa bbanga ddene wadde.
And that’s not his place to do that.	Era ekyo si kye kifo kye okukola ekyo.
I want to be such a good person.	Njagala kubeera muntu mulungi bwatyo.
I’m busy.	Nze ndi bbize.
This is a good thing for them.	Kino kintu kirungi gye bali.
What do you have?.	Olina ki?.
Who does he think.	Alowooza ani.
He thinks that.	Alowooza nti...
You have one hour.	Olina essaawa emu.
It would be the same for me.	Kyandibadde ekintu kye kimu gyendi.
But of course, it’s not.	Naye ddala, si bwe kiri.
I’m working on something.	Nze nkola ku kintu.
I don’t want to talk about my father	Saagala kwogera ku taata
It doesn’t matter who’s taking the picture.	Si kikulu ani akuba ekifaananyi.
But it’s not always serious	Naye si bulijjo nga kya maanyi
That wasn’t the case.	Ekyo nga si bwe kyali.
It was a serious problem.	Kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
But yes, it’s nice and easy.	Naye ye, kirungi era kyangu.
And maybe that’s a good thing.	Era mpozzi ekyo kintu kirungi.
You would be really good at that.	Ekyo wandibadde mulungi ddala.
He says he wants to do it to me.	Agamba nti ayagala kukikola ku nze.
I have to be with you now	Nnina okuba naawe kati
It’s easy to say.	Kyangu okwogera.
I love to read	Njagala nnyo okusoma
I can’t believe he would do this	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kino yandikoze
I couldn’t see the floor	Wansi nnali sisobola kulaba
Living with me is very difficult.	Okubeera nange kizibu nnyo.
He is a good man.	Musajja mulungi.
I’m afraid it won’t work.	Ntya nti tekijja kukola.
It’s not like that, it’s not.	Si nga bwe kiri, si bwe kiri.
He knows what we are like.	Amanyi bwe tuli.
I’m not here to do that.	Nze siri wano kukola ekyo.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
But it was the case.	Naye bwe kyali.
I'll be fine.	Nja kuba bulungi.
It’s the job.	Gwe mulimu.
They were friends, his friends.	Baali ba mukwano, mikwano gye.
I am very, very sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo, nnyo.
But he was her friend.	Naye yali mukwano gwe.
He was almost there.	Yali kumpi awo.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
I am so lucky to have him	Ndi wa mukisa nnyo nti nnina ye
She was so nice and pretty.	Yali mulungi nnyo era nga mulungi nnyo.
Things to them.	Ebintu gye bali.
I want to be there to help with that	Njagala kubeerawo okuyamba ku ekyo
He told me that himself.	Ekyo yangamba ye kennyini.
I was hesitant, but not too serious	Nnali nneebuuza, naye si kya maanyi nnyo
We certainly have.	Mazima ddala tulina.
I hope he goes to jail	Nsuubira nti agenda mu kkomera
Tonight, it’s not.	Ekiro kino, si bwe kiri.
He had it.	Yali alina.
That’s not very long term.	Ekyo si kya bbanga ddene nnyo.
He can't even .	Tasobola na .
He didn’t even want to.	Yali tayagala wadde.
I want this with you	Kino njagala naawe
Like yesterday’s work.	Nga omulimu gwa jjo.
I knew he wasn’t going	Namanya nti yali tagenda
I’m going to be a doctor, you know.	Ngenda kubeera musawo, omanyi.
I could barely see	Nnali sisobola bulungi kulaba
I may know what that is.	Nnyinza okuba nga mmanyi ekyo kye kiri.
I'm glad you're here!.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano!.
Now is not the time.	Kati si kye kiseera.
He was willing, and he could.	Yali mwetegefu, era yali asobola.
I have been lucky.	Mbadde wa mukisa.
I have absolutely no idea what he said	Sirina n’akatono kirowoozo ku bye yayogera
It was definitely quick.	Mazima ddala kyali kya mangu.
He was good, very good.	Yali mulungi, mulungi nnyo.
He is very lucky.	Ye mukisa nnyo.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
So far, no problems.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali buzibu.
One was my father.	Omu yali taata wange.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
He was a doctor.	Yali musawo.
I hope you’ll be okay	Nsuubira nti ojja kubeera bulungi
Where would he be with her.	Yandibadde naye ali ludda wa.
I was pretty sure of that.	Ekyo nnali nkakasa bulungi.
I hope to talk to you again	Nsuubira okuddamu okwogera naawe
We will talk about this.	Tujja kwogera ku nsonga eno.
Someone else did it.	Omuntu omulala yakikola.
He knew it would happen.	Yali akimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
He was a poet.	Yali muyimbi.
Maybe he's here.	Mpozzi ali wano.
That doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri.
But, yes, that is what really matters.	Naye, ye, ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
He wanted to do it .	Yali ayagala kukikola .
Maybe it was just that there was nothing to do.	Mpozzi kyali kituufu nga tewali kya kukola.
I'm not so sure.	Sikakasa nnyo.
I was sick and sick.	Nnali mulwadde era nga ndi mulwadde.
This is a powerful thing.	Kino kintu kya maanyi.
It will do the same.	Kijja kukola kye kimu.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
It’s not even an opinion.	Si wadde endowooza.
He is nothing like that.	Tali kintu nga ekyo.
Not for long.	Si lwa bbanga ddene.
I was very curious	Nnali njagala nnyo okumanya
This is not a good thing.	Kino si kirungi.
I think of you without it	Ndowooza ku ggwe nga tolina
Now he could see.	Kati yali asobola okulaba.
I have to be at home.	Nnina okubeera awaka.
That's what it is.	Ekyo kye ki.
You have no idea.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna.
Surely everyone does it.	Mazima buli muntu akikola.
He knew what he wanted to get from a player.	Yali amanyi ky’ayagala okufuna ku muzannyi.
I wanted to be me again	Nnali njagala okuddamu okubeera nze
It was the truth.	Yali mazima.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
Now it was happening.	Kati kyali kigenda mu maaso.
I know it was sudden	Nkimanyi nti kyali kya mangu
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
That would be a bad thing.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi.
He seemed to .	Yalabika ng’akola .
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
To me, anyway.	Eri nze, mu ngeri yonna.
I think that’s what’s important.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kikulu.
Now he looked better.	Kati yali alabika bulungi.
I have nothing to do with knowledge.	Sirina kye nkola ku kumanya.
I love it so much!!.	Njagala nnyo!!.
That’s not a bad thing at all.	Ekyo si kibi n’akatono.
I loved that about him	Ekyo nnali njagala nnyo ku ye
I thought it was great	Nalowooza nti kyali kirungi nnyo
It’s not exactly the same.	Si kye kimu ddala.
I wonder how long it might last	Nze nneebuuza nti kiyinza okumala ebbanga ki
And you can’t go home either.	Era naawe tosobola kudda waka.
I didn’t know how to answer that	Ekyo nnali simanyi ngeri ya kuddamu
I wanted it, more than anything	Nnali njagala, okusinga ekintu kyonna
But it’s not us.	Naye si ffe.
I always loved that one	Oyo bulijjo nnali njagala nnyo
And it’s certainly not that.	Era mazima ddala si ekyo.
I loved talking	Nnali njagala nnyo okwogera
I’m thinking about you	Nze ndowooza ku ggwe
I hope you can do it too	Nsuubira nti naawe osobola okukikola
I knew what he was doing.	Nnali mmanyi kye yali akola.
I wonder if you can	Nneebuuza oba osobola
He is very beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo.
It probably won’t work.	Oboolyawo tekijja kukola.
I guess we’ll see	Ntebereza nti tujja kulaba
And he was ready to move on.	Era yali mwetegefu okugenda mu maaso.
I know that I am in truth	Nkimanyi nti nze mu mazima
However, man was not very strong.	Kyokka, omuntu yali si wa maanyi nnyo.
I think you knew that at the time	Ndowooza ekyo mu kiseera ekyo wali okimanyi
I thought you would wait	Nalowooza nti ojja kulinda
I couldn’t be with him all the time	Nnali sisobola kubeera naye buli kiseera
Now he can't.	Kati tasobola.
And somehow it got what was coming to it.	Era mu ngeri emu yafuna kye yali ejja ku yo.
When, he can’t tell.	Ddi, tasobola kumanya.
I can’t always stay long	Bulijjo sisobola kumala bbanga ddene
I could see it happening too	Nange nnali nsobola okulaba nga kigenda mu maaso
I like to be alone	Njagala nnyo okubeera nzekka
I didn’t know why.	Nnali simanyi lwaki.
It will be your issue.	Kijja kuba nsonga yo.
I really wanted to talk to him.	Nnali njagala nnyo okwogera naye.
Anything can happen in the city!.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo mu kibuga!.
Maybe it is.	Mpozzi bwe kiri.
I was totally ready for it	Nnali mwetegefu ddala okukikola
But, there it was.	Naye, awo we kyali.
I will definitely do it.	Ddala nja kukikola.
He has a plan for you too.	Naawe alina enteekateeka gy’oli.
This seems fine to me.	Kino kirabika nga kirungi gyendi.
Excellent work, actually	Omulimu omulungi ennyo, mu butuufu
You won’t want money.	Tojja kwagala ssente.
I’m not sure of anything right now	Sikakasa kintu kyonna mu kiseera kino
You're not well.	Toli bulungi.
A little too harmless.	Katono nnyo nga tewali bulabe.
It was mine.	Yali yange.
You don’t want to be alone here.	Toyagala kubeera wekka wano.
How much not a person.	Nga nnyo si muntu.
He will do the same.	Ajja kukola kye kimu.
Terrible.	Kibi.
I just can’t believe it	Nze sisobola kukkiriza kyokka
I really wanted that.	Ekyo nnali njagala nnyo.
I should be.	Nze nsaanidde okuba.
But that was true and not true.	Naye ekyo kyali kituufu era si kituufu.
I didn’t know where to go	Nnali simanyi gye nnyinza kugenda
I’m going to do this.	Kino ngenda kukikola.
He can’t see that happening.	Tasobola kulaba ekyo nga kigenda mu maaso.
He was a wonderful child.	Yali mwana mulungi nnyo.
It is the time.	Ye kiseera.
It is a very important thing for us.	Kintu kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
This is not the issue now.	Eno si y’ensonga kati.
This is a good idea but not accurate.	Kino kirowoozo kirungi naye si kituufu.
It is what they are.	Kye kye bali.
I just want him happy	Njagala musanyufu kyokka
Maybe not for the baby, which she really wanted.	Mpozzi si ku mwana, kye yali ayagala ennyo.
You have to do whatever he wants.	Olina okukola kyonna ky’ayagala.
You are a lucky blessing.	Oli mukisa gwa mukisa.
Or almost three.	Oba kumpi ssatu.
I have to say something.	Nnina okwogera ekintu.
We will do well.	Tujja kukola bulungi.
It won’t do it.	Tekijja kukikola.
Something is going on.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
Now at home.	Kati awaka.
Not that you won’t.	Si nti togenda kukikola.
You have to be yourself.	Olina okuba ggwe kennyini.
It was really easy.	Ddala kyali kyangu.
I still couldn’t believe he said that to me	N’okutuusa kati nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti yangamba bw’atyo
I needed to know where he had been.	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya gye yali abadde.
This was a bad idea.	Kino kyali kirowoozo kibi.
I will never do anything like that again	Sijja kuddamu kukola kintu kyonna ng’ekyo
In fact, she looked great.	Mu butuufu, yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
I love being with you.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe.
He doesn’t want too much.	Tayagala bingi nnyo.
I didn’t really care at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sifaayo nnyo
A moment, that was all he needed	Akaseera katono, ekyo kyokka kye yali yeetaaga
He knew what you were thinking.	Yali amanyi kye wali olowooza.
He knew he would.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
I wonder if he knows	Nze nneebuuza oba amanyi
I think that’s very important	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo
I didn’t know it was there	Nze nali simanyi nti kyali awo
, but it won’t come.	, naye tekijja kujja.
I doubt he does.	Nbuusabuusa nti akola bw’atyo.
He said he wanted to go home.	Yagambye nti ayagala kudda waka.
Now I can’t love anyone.	Kati sisobola kwagala muntu yenna.
I need some time.	Nze nneetaaga akaseera.
I can’t do that right now	Ekyo sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino
I'm glad he did.	Ndi musanyufu nti yakikola.
I thought he might have you	Nalowooza nti ayinza okuba naawe
Perhaps he is.	Oboolyawo bw’atyo.
He could make a comeback from that.	Yali asobola okukola okudda okuva mu ekyo.
I can’t be with anyone right now	Sisobola kubeera na muntu yenna mu kiseera kino
Someone would be nice	Omuntu yandibadde mulungi
Here's the thing.	Wano ekintu.
I know he won’t come back	Nkimanyi nti tajja kudda
Everything was in perfect condition.	Buli kimu kyali mu mbeera nnungi.
He could only think clearly.	Yali asobola okulowooza obulungi yekka.
Probably not everyone.	Oboolyawo si buli muntu.
I was young.	Nnali muto.
But that’s not the point here.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga wano.
I can’t wait to come	Siyinza kulinda kujja
I am lucky in that regard	Ndi wa mukisa mu nsonga eyo
Or in me.	Oba mu nze.
I wasn’t interested.	Nze nali sifaayo.
He wasn’t coming.	Yali tajja.
I am nothing like that.	Nze siri kintu nga ekyo.
I have considered this option.	Nze nfunye okulowooza ku nkola eno.
I need to talk to myself	Nneetaaga okwogera nange
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
Much younger than usual today.	Muto nnyo okusinga ku bulijjo leero.
You want it bad.	Oyagala kibi.
I needed that alone	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga okubeera nzekka
But where is he?.	Naye ali ludda wa?.
I was in the hospital when he did	Nali mu ddwaaliro we yakola
You might think that’s great.	Oyinza okulowooza nti ekyo kirungi nnyo.
He had certainly had enough.	Mazima ddala yali amaze.
I am happy if he can live with her	Ndi musanyufu singa asobola okubeera naye
I have no strength.	Sirina maanyi.
I have a nightmare tonight	Nnina ekiro ekiro ekiro kino
I could say a lot of things	Nnali nsobola okwogera ebintu bingi
In fact, he isn’t.	Mu butuufu, si bw’atyo.
Something he saw for a short time.	Ekintu kye yalaba okumala akaseera katono.
I'll go to the police	Nja kugenda ku poliisi
What were you doing.	Ggwe wali okola ki.
He really does.	Ddala akikola.
He couldn’t see.	Yali tasobola kulaba.
I didn’t want to be alone	Nnali saagala kubeera nzekka
I know you will be with her in the hospital for a while.	Nkimanyi nti ojja kubeera naye mu ddwaaliro okumala akaseera.
But he is still my child.	Naye akyali mwana wange.
You are not my friend.	Ggwe toli mukwano gwange.
This is and isn’t exactly the case.	Kino bwe kiri era si bwe kiri ddala.
I can always help, you know	Bulijjo nsobola okuyamba, omanyi
What do you think about this?.	Olowooza ki ku nsonga eno?.
I hoped he was still with her	Nali nsuubira nti yali akyali naye
I thought it might be a problem	Nalowooza nti kiyinza okuba nga kizibu
He went everywhere with me.	Yagenda nange buli wamu.
Of course, he does.	Kya lwatu nti akola bw’atyo.
I need everyone to do their job	Nze nneetaaga buli muntu okukola omulimu gwe
At the same time, he has everything to gain.	Mu kiseera kye kimu, alina buli kimu ky’alina okufuna.
That's what it is.	Ekyo kye ki.
But no one knows anything.	Naye tewali amanyi kintu kyonna.
I didn’t want to talk to anyone	Nnali saagala kwogera na muntu yenna
You were the one.	Ggwe wali omu.
But anyone who thinks that.	Naye omuntu yenna alowooza ekyo.
I was him.	Nze nali ye.
It was actually really good.	Mu butuufu kyali kirungi ddala.
I can’t go anywhere.	Sisobola kugenda yonna.
He does the same thing.	Akola kye kimu.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Mpozzi nga si kikulu.
He is one with me in so many ways.	Ye omu nange mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo.
I know what his problem is	Nkimanyi ekizibu kye kye kiri
He doesn’t even think about going home.	Talowooza wadde ku kudda waka.
But yes, you have to do it.	Naye ye, olina okukikola.
No response from the house.	Tewali kuddamu okuva mu nnyumba.
I have to be going now.	Nnina okuba nga ngenda kati.
I was in a hurry to get home	Nali mu bwangu okutuuka awaka
And he had been.	Era yali abadde.
Almost all of us, but not all of us.	Kumpi ffenna, naye si ffenna.
You're in.	Oli mu.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
No one goes home here.	Wano tewali agenda waka.
I didn’t know what to do or where to go	Nnali simanyi kya kukola wadde gye nnali ngenda
I just want to be happy	Njagala kubeera musanyufu kyokka
But he won’t do it.	Naye tajja kukikola.
I don’t like that being the case.	Sikyagala ekyo bwe kiri.
That’s very important to me.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo gyendi.
I would love to get your feedback	Njagala nnyo okufuna endowooza yo
I want to be in the here and now	Njagala kubeera mu wano ne kati
That’s what he did.	Ekyo yakikola.
I thought it would happen.	Nnalowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
I’m not going to jail	Sigenda mu kkomera
But that’s not really what’s going on here.	Naye ekyo mu butuufu si kye kigenda mu maaso wano.
I honestly thought he couldn’t	Mu butuufu nnalowooza nti yali tasobola
I need to read.	Nze nneetaaga okusoma.
Maybe it’s for survival.	Mpozzi nga kya kubeerawo.
I know, she thought.	Nkimanyi, bwe yalowooza.
But he didn’t want to.	Naye yali tayagala.
It’s not going anywhere.	Tewali we kigenda.
I was nervous but I was doing fine	Nali ntya naye nga nkola bulungi
We definitely have a problem.	Mazima ddala tulina ekizibu.
He is his friend.	Ye mukwano gwe.
It was there though.	Kyali awo wadde.
You will come stronger.	Ojja kujja nga wa maanyi.
I certainly wasn’t going to do it	Mazima ddala nnali sigenda kukikola
It matters who does it best.	Kikulu ani asinga okukikola.
I need to get out of this place	Nze nneetaaga okuva mu kifo kino
I didn’t know you had been in school	Nze nali simanyi nti obadde mu ssomero
I will talk to him three ways	Nja kwogera naye engeri ssatu
There's a lot, actually.	Waliwo bingi, mu butuufu.
I was too scared to be alone	Nnali ntya nnyo ne sisobola kubeera nzekka
What a strong child.	Nga mwana wa maanyi.
I will be back, and hopefully soon	Nja kudda, era nsuubira mu bbanga ttono
He said he was happy.	Yagambye nti musanyufu.
I really need some time to think	Nze ddala nneetaaga akaseera okulowooza
We have a moment.	Tulina akaseera.
All right, we'll try it your way.	Kirungi, tujja kugezaako mu ngeri yo.
Actually.	Mazima.
I didn’t want to.	Nnali saagala.
He needed to know.	Yali yeetaaga okumanya.
That we.	Nti ffe.
I know what you want to do	Nze mmanyi ky’oyagala okukola
But it looks good.	Naye kirabika bulungi.
I love how you are with me	Njagala nnyo engeri gy’oli nange
Pretty good, actually.	Kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
I don’t think it’s necessarily good or bad.	Sirowooza nti kituufu nti kirungi oba kibi.
Everything is a blessing.	Buli kimu mukisa.
And well he might.	Era bulungi ayinza.
However, in my own way.	Kyokka mu ngeri yange.
I know what he wants	Nze mmanyi ky’ayagala
Good, actually.	Kirungi, mu butuufu.
Actually, you do.	Mu butuufu, ggwe okola.
I was doing really well.	Nali nkola bulungi ddala.
I'm going, he said.	Ngenda, bwe yagambye.
I knew it had to happen	Namanya nti kyalina okubaawo
Though it won’t be for long now.	Wadde nga tekijja kumala bbanga ddene kati.
I wasn’t well at all	Nze nali siri bulungi n’akatono
I don't know how to say this.	Kino simanyi ngeri ya kwogera.
I was feeling pretty good	Nali mpulira bulungi nnyo
We have no plans.	Tetulina nteekateeka.
Can't really talk to him though.	Tasobola kwogera naye ddala wadde.
No, no, not waiting.	Nedda, nedda, si kulinda.
Someone he was working with.	Omuntu gwe yali akola naye.
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
I don’t know why.	Simanyi lwaki.
Planning is the same.	Okukola enteekateeka kye kimu.
He couldn’t let that happen.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
This was a daily occurrence.	Kino kyali kya buli lunaku.
No one knew who we were	Tewali yali amanyi kye tuli
For a long time.	Okumala ebbanga ddene.
For the same.	Ku kye kimu.
I knew it was true	Nnali nkimanyi nti kituufu
I was friendly to them	Nnali wa mukwano gye bali
But you don’t really have to.	Naye mu butuufu tolina.
I don’t even know what to say.	Simanyi na kya kwogera.
I wonder how he is	Nze nneebuuza nti ali atya
He didn't know what to do with this.	Kino yali tamanyi kya kukola.
You are my only friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange wekka.
I can't speak.	Sisobola kwogera.
One is my good father to me.	Omu ye taata wange omulungi gyendi.
You don’t have a place.	Tolina kifo.
I expected us to be friends	Nali nsuubira nti tujja kuba ba mukwano
I have been my man	Nze mbadde musajja wange
You are not like us.	Ggwe toli nga ffe.
He needed to think clearly.	Yali yeetaaga okulowooza obulungi.
I suppose it's time though	Nsuubira nti kye kiseera wadde
I want to know what that is like	Njagala okumanya ekyo bwe kiri
I don’t really know what’s going to happen.	Simanyi ddala kiki ekigenda okubaawo.
I want to stay here.	Njagala kusigala wano.
I can’t do anything about it.	Nze sirina kye nsobola kukola.
Are you happy now?.	Kati oli musanyufu?.
I won’t go on	Sijja kugenda mu maaso
I have no idea whatsoever.	Sirina ndowooza yonna.
Everyone did it.	Buli omu yakikola.
I love how it looks in my house.	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kirabika mu nnyumba yange.
He had to go.	Yalina okugenda.
However, he had to do it.	Kyokka yalina okukikola.
I thought it was going down	Nalowooza nti kyali kigenda wansi
I was happy to go.	Nnali musanyufu okugenda.
I was feeling pretty good about myself	Nali mpulira bulungi nnyo ku nze
I knew almost none of this.	Kumpi ku bino nnali simanyi.
Or he made the time.	Oba yakola obudde.
It’s not a job or a job.	Si mulimu oba omulimu.
I will never do it again.	Sijja kuddamu kukikola.
It is very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo.
I have a problem before	Nnina ekizibu emabegako
I didn’t know where my father was	Nali simanyi taata gye yali
He prayed.	Yasaba.
I thought we were going to be safe here	Nalowooza nti wano tugenda kuba tetulina bulabe
He was obviously at home.	Kya lwatu nti yali waka.
You would like something moving.	Wandyagadde ekintu ekigenda mu maaso.
I wonder what we are going to do now	Nze nneebuuza kati kye tugenda okukola
He had been my friend.	Yali abadde mukwano gwange.
But he was more than that.	Naye yali asinga ekyo.
You won’t be able to get back into your routine though.	Tojja kusobola kudda mu nkola yo wadde.
I don’t think that’s it.	Sirowooza nti ekyo kye kiri.
I wanted more than anything to be alone with him	Nnali njagala okusinga ekintu kyonna okubeera nzekka naye
There is a good opportunity for you.	Waliwo omukisa omulungi gy’oli.
What a really bad thing.	Nga ddala kibi.
But it looked great.	Naye nga kirabika bulungi nnyo.
I'm like you.	Nze nga ggwe.
Is there such a thing?.	Waliwo ekintu nga kino?.
It’s not something without it.	Si kintu nga tewali.
It is a very good idea.	Kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
He doesn’t know what he wants.	Kye ayagala tamanyi.
I know you want to go down there right now	Nkimanyi nti oyagala kugenda wansi awo kati kati
One of us always goes, you know.	Omu ku ffe bulijjo agenda, omanyi.
It’s not really you.	Mu butuufu si ggwe.
He had the time.	Yalina obudde.
I don’t think this is a problem	Kino sirowooza nti kizibu
He looks really good to us.	Alabika bulungi ddala gye tuli.
I hoped he was doing better than me	Nali nsuubira nti yali akola bulungi okusinga nze
She looked that good.	Yali alabika bulungi bw’atyo.
And my father was working hard.	Era taata yali akola nnyo.
Apparently he has.	Kirabika alina...
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
I was hoping it wasn’t money	Nali nsuubira nti si ssente
What a perfect time.	Nga kiseera kituufu.
He can’t do that.	Ekyo tasobola kukikola.
All, all, all.	Byonna, byonna, byonna.
I thought about what he said	Nalowooza ku bye yayogera
That was it, of course.	Ekyo kye kyali, ddala.
I don’t think that’s likely.	Sirowooza nti ekyo kiyinza okubaawo.
I wasn’t coming at you	Nze nali sijja ku ggwe
I didn’t know what was going to happen	Nnali simanyi kyali kigenda kubaawo
We will have to work with what we have.	Tujja kuba tulina okukola ku bye tulina.
There is no reason why you should.	Tewali nsonga lwaki olina.
My father must have too.	Taata naye ateekwa okuba nga yalina.
You’ve been lucky.	Obadde wa mukisa.
I didn’t know you had so much in you	Nali simanyi nti olina bingi mu ggwe
Excellent job too	Omulimu omulungi ennyo naye akola
Let and	Ka era ne .
I plan to do it as soon as possible	Nkola enteekateeka okukikola mu bwangu
He's a nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi.
That we all are.	Nti ffenna tuli.
I feel so strong now	Mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi nnyo kati
I don’t want to know any of this	Saagala kumanya kintu kyonna ku bino
But he did this.	Naye kino yakikola.
But everyone did everything.	Naye buli omu yakola buli kimu.
I was very, very sick.	Nali mulwadde nnyo nnyo.
I'm the one.	Nze ye.
It could be anything.	Kiyinza okuba kyonna.
We can talk about ideas.	Tusobola okwogera ku ndowooza.
Just one night.	Ekiro kimu kyokka.
This is an opportunity for you.	Guno mukisa gyoli.
I’m not that either	Nze nange siri ekyo
He certainly likes to win.	Mazima ddala ayagala nnyo okuwangula.
In fact, or should also.	Mu butuufu, oba yandibadde era.
I will never return to this place	Sijja kudda mu kifo kino
I am a human being like you.	Nze ndi muntu nga ggwe.
I think everyone knows what they are	Ndowooza buli muntu amanyi kye bali
Thinking is difficult.	Okulowooza kizibu.
We were all there.	Ffenna twali.
Actually.	Mazima.
I think you’re sick	Ndowooza nti oli mulwadde
We will do that.	Ekyo tujja kukikola.
But it always seems right to be here.	Naye bulijjo kirabika nga kituufu okubeera wano.
I love beauty	Njagala nnyo bulungi
He needs to go to the hospital.	Yeetaaga okugenda mu ddwaaliro.
This is powerful for us.	Kino kya maanyi gye tuli.
I can’t do without it.	Siyinza kukola nga sirina.
And he only saw one.	Era yalaba omu yekka.
Or for every reason.	Oba lwa buli nsonga.
It looks pretty good there though.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo eyo wadde.
I am that but so much more.	Nze ekyo naye bingi nnyo.
That’s not a good time.	Ekyo si kiseera kirungi.
Everyone has money.	Buli muntu alina ssente.
I love this movie	Njagala nnyo firimu eno
Today, no one does that.	Leero, tewali akola ekyo.
That’s true for me.	Ekyo kituufu gyendi.
I’m sure we both need time.	Nkakasa nti ffembi twetaaga obudde.
I hope you are very happy.	Nsuubira nti oli musanyufu nnyo.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
I couldn’t see clearly.	Nnali sisobola kulaba bulungi.
We can do this.	Kino tusobola okukikola.
I didn’t really think that was his problem	Mu butuufu nnali sirowooza nti ekyo kye kyali ekizibu kye
I think he knew it too	Ndowooza naye yali akimanyi
I know what you want	Nze mmanyi ky’oyagala
You’re the real thing.	Ggwe ddala.
So can we, too.	Naffe naffe bwe tusobola.
I was a good person.	Nnali muntu mulungi.
I wanted this more than he did	Kino nnali njagala nnyo okusinga ye
I’m all of us.	Nze ffenna.
I couldn’t do anything about it though	Nnali sisobola kukikola kintu kyonna wadde
You're not even human.	Toli wadde omuntu.
I can see the office anytime today	Nsobola okulaba ofiisi essaawa yonna leero
I knew he was there	Namanya nti yali awo
I am not lucky with this either.	Kino nange sirina mukisa.
He wants to know everything.	Ayagala okumanya buli kimu.
And they are.	Era bwe bali.
I want to be on this	Njagala kubeera ku kino
Someone should know.	Waliwo omuntu alina okumanya.
No one went to jail.	Tewali yagenda mu kkomera.
And you should, too.	Era naawe wandibadde.
But there is help, and there is hope.	Naye waliwo obuyambi, era waliwo essuubi.
We will do it.	Tujja kukikola.
I can’t do anything about it	Sisobola kukikola kintu kyonna
I do things like that.	Nkola ebintu nga ebyo.
For me it was really easy to do that.	Nze ddala kyali kyangu okukola ekyo.
And he knows exactly what to do.	Era amanyi bulungi ky’alina okukola.
I won’t be working this week	Sijja kuba nkola wiiki eno
He felt very comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo.
I really have no problem.	Mazima ddala sirina buzibu.
Where was the other one.	Omulala yali wa.
But now, we have.	Naye kati, tulina.
And yes, you are.	Era ye, ggwe oli.
And you can.	Era osobola.
One hour, it’s over.	Ssaawa emu, ewedde.
That’s not you.	Ekyo ggwe toli.
I had no idea what the problem was	Nnali simanyi kizibu kye kyali
I wasn’t this kind of guy at all	Nze nali ggaayi wa ngeri eno n’akatono
There is so much more.	Waliwo bingi nnyo.
You are with me now.	Oli nange kati.
I'll see that myself.	Nze kennyini nja kulaba ekyo.
But a dog is not a person.	Naye embwa si muntu.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange asinga.
He is not here now.	Tali wano kati.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
I really have to go now.	Ddala nnina okugenda kati.
I was to be with him down there	Nali wa kubeera naye wansi awo
I just wanted to be ready	Nnali njagala kubeera mwetegefu kyokka
I really wanted to get out of there	Nnali njagala nnyo okuva awo
He was happy.	Yali musanyufu.
But you won’t come back.	Naye tojja kudda.
In the sky.	Mu bbanga.
It’s not really any of my business.	Mu butuufu si nsonga yange yonna.
But you have a point.	Naye olina ensonga.
The problem is me.	Obuzibu nze.
I didn’t know exactly	Nnali simanyi bulungi
That’s right, you know.	Ekyo kituufu, omanyi.
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
This is a very serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I can drive better than anyone here	Nsobola okuvuga obulungi okusinga omuntu yenna wano
Nothing for me.	Tewali kintu kyonna gyendi.
You won’t do it.	Tojja kukikola.
I can’t talk to anyone	Sisobola kwogera na muntu yenna
For me it was very powerful.	Nze kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
That is not the case here.	Ekyo si bwe kiri wano.
Maybe he shouldn’t.	Mpozzi nga tasaanidde kukikola.
He said he was alone.	Yagambye nti yali yekka.
I love the view from here	Njagala nnyo okulaba okuva wano
I can eat almost anything too	Nange nsobola okulya kumpi ekintu kyonna
I hope this was something you were willing to do	Nsuubira kino kyali kintu kye wali mwetegefu okukola
I won’t tell anyone what’s going on	Sijja kubuulira muntu yenna ekigenda mu maaso
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
I have that issue too.	Nze nange ensonga eyo nnina.
It was very important to us.	Kyali kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
He is a human being.	Ye muntu.
That he shouldn’t have done it.	Nti yali tasaanidde kukikola.
He knows.	Amanyi.
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
He didn’t need to do that at all.	Ekyo yali teyeetaaga kukikola n’akatono.
As simple as that.	Nga kyangu nga ekyo.
I can’t speak at the moment	Sisobola kwogera mu kiseera kino
But you can’t talk.	Naye tosobola kwogera.
He wants to know what’s going on.	Ayagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso.
He's like me.	Ye nga nze.
One person said it would be difficult.	Omuntu omu yagamba nti kijja kuba kizibu.
I actually thought that	Mu butuufu nnali ndowooza ekyo
I don’t really know.	Simanyi ddala.
And yet it was real.	Era naye kyali kya ddala.
And he was very young.	Era nga muto nnyo.
It would be a bad thing.	Kyandibadde kibi.
I didn’t even know what	Nali simanyi na kiki
However, I cannot see clearly	Kyokka sisobola kulaba bulungi
Not exactly there.	Si awo ddala.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola.
You have it, too.	Naawe olina.
I thought she would like to know	Nalowooza nti yandiyagadde okumanya
That I should go over that now	Ekyo nsaanidde okugenda ku ekyo kati
I don’t know how to be.	Simanyi ngeri ya kubeera.
No one knows who it is.	Tewali amanyi ani.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
But that’s not a problem.	Naye ekyo si kizibu.
I think he went though	Ndowooza yagenda wadde
You can’t help it.	Tosobola kuyamba.
This is normal, normal.	Kino kya bulijjo, kya bulijjo.
If he was, he would have to just do it.	Singa yali, yandibadde alina okumala okukikola.
There is time.	Waliwo obudde.
This will be the same.	Kino kijja kuba kye kimu.
Here we both were.	Wano ffembi twali.
My father is unemployed.	Taata talina mulimu.
It’s just a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi kyokka.
You should definitely get a dog.	Olina ddala okufuna embwa.
I knew where he lived, but still	Nali mmanyi gye yali abeera, naye nga n’okutuusa kati
I’d like to say it is, but it’s not.	Njagala okugamba nti bwe kiri, naye si bwe kiri.
He looks like that	Alabika bwatyo .
I think that’s pretty cool	Ndowooza ekyo kirungi nnyo
He said he knew and would do it.	Yagambye nti amanyi era ajja kukikola.
That’s what he wants.	Ekyo ayagala.
We only have one guy down.	Tulina ggaayi omu kyokka wansi.
Most likely, he would be there.	Okusinga, yandibadde awo.
He is willing to do anything.	Mwetegefu okukola kyonna.
That’s what we need.	Ekyo twetaaga.
I will be ready.	Nja kuba mwetegefu.
I already knew he was her brother	Namanya dda nti ye muganda we
I feel like.	Mpulira nga.
I know you can’t do it	Nkimanyi nti tosobola kukikola
Under.	Wansi.
Without my child.	Nga tewali mwana wange.
I guess we’ll just have to see	Ntebereza nti tujja kumala kulaba
But we don’t have time.	Naye tetulina budde.
Nothing will happen.	Tewali kijja kubaawo.
I was really quick.	Mazima ddala nnali mangu ddala.
I’m not going anywhere without you.	Sirina gye ngenda nga tolina.
But not really.	Naye si ddala.
He agreed and that was that.	Yakkiriza era ekyo kye kyali.
We are together tonight.	Tuli wamu ekiro kino.
I want your opinion on that	Njagala endowooza yo ku nsonga eyo
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
I couldn’t believe it.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza.
I couldn’t do something like that	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu ng’ekyo
But this goes a long way.	Naye kino kigenda mu maaso nnyo.
Clearly, he is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bw’atyo.
We can do it.	Tusobola okukikola.
But, he’s not the one he seems to be.	Naye, si y’alabika.
Everyone worked hard.	Buli omu yakola nnyo.
He said he couldn’t.	Yagamba nti tasobola.
The plan is in place	Enteekateeka eri mu nkola
I have to do everything myself	Nze kennyini nnina okukola buli kimu
It’s probably a complicated problem.	Oboolyawo kizibu kizibu.
In fact, that is not the case.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si bwe kiri.
But they are.	Naye bwe bali.
So far, no one was coming.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali yali ajja.
He was here.	Yali wano.
Reading the speech, it was great.	Okusoma okwogera, kyali kirungi nnyo.
I knew what that was like	Ekyo nnali mmanyi bwe kyali
He knew this was true.	Yali akimanyi nti kino kituufu.
My father was home early too.	Taata naye yali awaka nga bukyali.
This is very common.	Kino kya bulijjo nnyo.
I’m fine with it.	Nze ndi bulungi.
All things really.	Ebintu byonna ddala.
That’s not what we’re going to do.	Ekyo si kye tugenda okukola.
It is a matter of fact.	Ensonga ya mazima.
Someone else, anyone else.	Omuntu omulala, omuntu omulala yenna.
I wasn’t sure why.	Nnali sikakasa lwaki.
What he was doing.	Kye yali akola.
I didn’t want to go home	Nnali saagala kudda waka
I was really desperate	Ddala nnali nfunye essuubi
I thought you were just a human being	Nalowooza nti oli muntu yekka
He was actually quite interested.	Mu butuufu yali ayagala nnyo.
You’ll want to watch.	Ojja kwagala okulaba.
I don’t want to know who it is.	Saagala kumanya ani.
Hope that maybe we can win this thing.	Essuubi nti mpozzi tusobola okuwangula ekintu kino.
In this case,.	Mu mbeera eno,...
I feel almost empty	Mpulira nga ndi kumpi nga sirina kintu kyonna
He has an office.	Alina ofiisi.
I definitely love it	Nze mazima ddala njagala nnyo
Not everyone knows everything about everything.	Si buli muntu nti amanyi buli kimu ku buli kimu.
But for that matter.	Naye ku nsonga eyo.
I was sure of that	Ekyo nnali nkakasa
I thought he was still in the hospital.	Nalowooza nti yali akyali mu ddwaaliro.
I can’t believe it was him	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ye yali
There is a problem with that.	Waliwo obuzibu ku ekyo.
There is one there.	Waliwo emu eyo.
This will probably happen quite a bit.	Kino osanga kijja kubaawo katono nnyo.
I don't care where.	Sifaayo wa.
I really needed to get out of there	Nnali nneetaaga nnyo okuva awo
Who could speak.	Ani yali asobola okwogera.
I needed to talk to him	Nnali nneetaaga okwogera naye
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
And just to be aware of it.	Era okubeera nga okimanyi kyokka.
In the morning, yes.	Ku makya, ye.
A week ago it was very busy, and now, nothing	Wiiki emu emabega kyali bbize nnyo, era kati, tewali
But that was great for me	Naye ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo gyendi
I can't find any way to do this.	Kino sisobola kufuna ngeri yonna gye nnyinza kukola.
I need to call the hospital	Nze nneetaaga okukuba essimu mu ddwaaliro
And he has it.	Era alina.
In any case.	Mu ngeri yonna.
I was just wondering	Nze nnali nneebuuza kyokka
Not everyone knows that.	Ekyo si buli muntu nti akimanyi.
I won’t do it either	Nange sijja kukikola
But one has to move on.	Naye omuntu alina okugenda mu maaso.
I was dangerous, he always told me	Nnali wa bulabe, bulijjo yang’amba
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
This is a really good thing in my opinion.	Kino ddala kintu kirungi mu ndowooza yange.
He was ready.	Yali mwetegefu.
I love being with him.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye.
I had no reason to fear the police	Nnali sirina nsonga lwaki ntya poliisi
He was acting quickly.	Yali akola mu bwangu.
I didn’t know what to do	Nnali simanyi kya kukola
I want to be with you all the time	Njagala kubeera naawe buli kiseera
I am very happy to be here	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano
He needs help.	Yeetaaga obuyambi.
It was coming towards them.	Yali ejja gye bali.
I wasn’t sure at the time	Nnali sikakasa kiseera ekyo
I just want to stay here	Njagala kusigala wano kyokka
I wonder if he is alone.	Nze nneebuuza oba ali yekka.
That wasn’t what I was afraid of.	Ekyo si kye nnali ntya.
I thought you wouldn’t	Nalowooza nti togenda kukikola
And before anyone could say anything.	Era nga omuntu yenna tannaba kwogera kintu kyonna.
I was well and truly in the place	Nali bulungi era nga ddala ndi mu kifo ekyo
And we can go now.	Era tusobola okugenda kati.
I thought he was already in the house.	Nalowooza nti yali amaze mu nnyumba.
I think something is going to happen.	Ndowooza waliwo ekigenda okubaawo.
He said there wasn't.	Yagambye nti tewali.
Everything looks good.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi.
We’ll see what happens tomorrow.	Tujja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo enkya.
One of us has to go.	Omu ku ffe alina okugenda.
He wanted to go home.	Yali ayagala kudda waka.
I will never play with you again	Sijja kuddamu kuzannya naawe
I won’t say more than that	Sijja kwogera okusinga awo
It wasn’t what he wanted.	Si ye yali ayagala.
. . . .	.
I can think clearly	Nsobola okulowooza obulungi
This is very easy to see.	Kino kyangu nnyo okulaba.
But he wanted to talk about it.	Naye yali ayagala okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
When he started.	Bwe yatandika.
It’s good for everyone.	Kirungi eri buli muntu.
Can help with this please.	Asobola okuyamba ku kino nsaba.
But not for this.	Naye si lwa kino.
You have to get out of the house.	Olina okuva mu nnyumba.
The opinion was mine.	Endowooza yali yange.
I am actually very happy.	Mu butuufu ndi musanyufu nnyo.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I don’t know anyone like that.	Simanyi muntu yenna nga oyo.
I can't find a good way to do this though	Sisobola kufuna ngeri nnungi ya kukola kino wadde
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
Everything is fine.	Buli kimu kirungi.
Just you and me.	Nze naawe ffekka.
I know this is serious	Nkimanyi kino kya maanyi
I loved all of those things	Ebintu ebyo byonna nnali njagala nnyo
I need to get to work.	Nze nneetaaga okutuuka ku mulimu.
In fact, no one seems to know exactly where it was.	Mu butuufu tewali alabika amanyi bulungi gye kyali.
This is true everywhere.	Kino kituufu buli wamu.
He was willing.	Yali ayagala.
That will be very difficult.	Ekyo kijja kuba kizibu nnyo.
I was happy to see that	Ekyo nnali musanyufu okulaba
It was probably a good thing.	Oboolyawo kyali kirungi.
That’s what he wanted.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala.
And next weekend.	Era wiikendi ejja.
But he was him.	Naye ye yali ye.
I will talk to him about it.	Nja kwogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
Or he does but he doesn’t want to.	Oba akola naye nga tayagala.
He did an excellent job.	Yakola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
This is a good thing for me right now.	Kino kintu kirungi gyendi mu kiseera kino.
It was really bad.	Ddala kyali kibi.
I knew it was coming anyway	Namanya nti kijja mu ngeri yonna
She was a beautiful woman.	Yali mukyala mulungi.
I will be here for the weekend.	Nja kubeera wano ku wiikendi.
I just wanted to know what it was	Nnali njagala kumanya kye kyali kyokka
I had no choice	Nnali sirina ngeri yonna gye nnyinza kukola
It will work.	Kijja kukola.
In fact, he probably did.	Mu butuufu, oboolyawo yakikola.
Or that.	Oba ekyo.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Obviously, it is.	Kya lwatu nti bwe kiri.
Despite this alone.	Wadde kino kyokka.
Until now.	Okutuusa kati.
Not for the money.	Si lwa ssente.
He didn't know how to do that.	Ekyo yali tamanyi ngeri ya kukikola.
He wasn’t going to go.	Yali tagenda kugenda.
I wonder why we are here	Nze nneebuuza lwaki tuli wano
But it wasn’t him.	Naye si ye yali.
I couldn’t do anything	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
I am very sick.	Ndi mulwadde nnyo.
But don’t go, anyone.	Naye togenda, omuntu yenna.
Any way is good.	Engeri yonna nnungi.
I’m making a movie.	Nkola firimu.
I knew nothing about him	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye
Close to you we are.	Kumpi naawe tuli.
I think he is not well.	Ndowooza nti tali bulungi.
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo nnyo
I wonder how that can happen	Nneebuuza engeri ekyo gye kiyinza okubaawo
And so he should be.	Era bw’atyo yandibadde.
We have to buy everything ourselves.	Tulina okugula buli kimu ffekka.
I have to talk about it	Nnina okwogera ku nsonga eyo
So he makes a plan.	Bwatyo akola enteekateeka.
I knew nothing about that time	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku kiseera ekyo
It would be nice to win.	Kyandibadde kirungi okuwangula.
That’s the point.	Eyo y’ensonga.
I can’t believe this is happening	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kino kigenda mu maaso
He always does well.	Bulijjo akola bulungi.
Not very good, but true.	Si kirungi nnyo, naye kituufu.
I know you’re strong	Nkimanyi nti olina amaanyi
But there was nothing.	Naye nga tewali.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali.
I wonder what he thought of it all	Nneebuuza kye yalowooza ku byonna
He saw an opportunity.	Yalaba omukisa.
This was a good plan.	Eno yali nteekateeka nnungi.
He already knew it.	Yali akimanyi dda.
I should, it feels pretty good though	Nze nsaanidde, mpulira bulungi nnyo wadde
I don't know why.	Simanyi lwa ki.
You are one of us now.	Oli omu ku ffe kati.
That wasn’t the issue.	Eyo si ye yali ensonga.
But he would if he wanted to.	Naye yandikoze singa yali ayagala.
I think we should just go	Ndowooza tusaanidde kumala kugenda
He wants to go to the house.	Ayagala kugenda mu nnyumba.
Now, that will do it.	Kati, ekyo kijja kukikola.
I am a strong man in my own right.	Ndi musajja wa maanyi mu ngeri yange.
But nothing was as bad as this.	Naye tewali kyali kibi nga kino.
He could see nothing.	Tewali kye yali asobola kulaba.
That’s not the point.	Eyo si y’ensonga.
We’ll have to see.	Tujja kuba tulina okulaba.
I’m not going to.	Nze sigenda.
To see how it is.	Okulaba bwe kiri.
Not everyone loves reading, and that’s fine.	Si buli muntu nti ayagala nnyo okusoma, era ekyo kirungi.
I hope that continues.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kigenda mu maaso.
I had no plans	Nnali sirina nteekateeka
I knew what he was capable of	Nnali mmanyi kye yali asobola
Until now, perhaps.	N’okutuusa kati, mpozzi.
Not a very good situation.	Si mbeera nnungi nnyo.
We’re going to do it together.	Tugenda kukikola ffenna.
He probably had his reasons.	Oboolyawo yalina ensonga ze.
Really, really good work.	Omulimu omulungi ddala, ddala.
He has been in need of help.	Abadde yeetaaga obuyambi.
He had to do this.	Kino yalina okukikola.
All right, all right, she said.	Kirungi, kirungi, bwe yagamba.
Everyone wants things.	Buli muntu ayagala ebintu.
He had us.	Yalina ffe.
And he had reason to be able to be both.	Era yalina ensonga lwaki yali asobola okuba bombi.
That was a very difficult one	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo
I was ready to get home	Nnali mwetegefu okutuuka awaka
But the thing is, it’s not as simple as that.	Naye ekintu kiri nti, si kyangu nga ekyo.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kintu kirungi nnyo.
I loved it too.	Nange nnali njagala nnyo.
I need to get out of here, she thought	Nze nneetaaga okuva wano, bwe yalowooza
It is in good condition.	Kiri mu mbeera nnungi.
You have everything you ever wanted.	Olina buli kimu kye wali oyagala.
I wish I could help more	Njagala nnyo okuyamba nnyo
I obviously didn’t care	Kya lwatu nti nnali sifaayo
One might answer this.	Omuntu ayinza okuddamu kino.
I feel so good with him	Mpulira bulungi nnyo naye
I couldn’t do my job	Nnali sisobola kukola mulimu gwange
He just wanted to be with her.	Yali ayagala kubeera naye yekka.
I just didn’t want to say that	Ekyo nnali saagala kwogera kyokka
I know that’s not the case	Nkimanyi nti ekyo si bwe kiri
I really didn’t want to go	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kugenda
Someone lives there already.	Waliwo omuntu abeera eyo dda.
I know exactly what that is	Nkimanyi bulungi ekyo bwe kiri
Maybe we’ll win tomorrow.	Mpozzi tujja kuwangula enkya.
But he was happy.	Naye yali musanyufu.
I have to think of everyone here	Nnina okulowooza ku buli muntu wano
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
I knew exactly where it was going	Nali mmanyi bulungi gye kyali kigenda
That’s not how it is now.	Bw’atyo si bwe kiri kati.
I wonder why we are here	Nze nneebuuza lwaki tuli wano
I was too sick to speak.	Nnali mulwadde nnyo nga sisobola kwogera.
I don’t want to talk about him	Saagala kwogera ku ye
He certainly had no plans for anyone.	Mazima ddala yali talina nteekateeka ya muntu yenna.
He should have.	Yandibadde alina.
Everyone was very happy.	Buli omu yali musanyufu nnyo.
That will likely happen again tonight, as well.	Ekyo kirabika kijja kuddamu okubaawo ekiro kino, era.
Not you and you, or me and me.	Si ggwe naawe, oba nze nange.
But he	Naye ye .
I hope that’s what it is	Nsuubira nti ekyo kye kiri
Now it was for everyone.	Kati kyali kya buli muntu.
I couldn’t say anything	Nnali sisobola kwogera kintu kyonna
You can do that too.	Ekyo naawe osobola okukikola.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
There's no reason he should be.	Tewali nsonga lwaki yandibadde bw'atyo.
This is worse than anything.	Kino kibi okusinga ekintu kyonna.
He will have to leave this house.	Ajja kuba alina okuva mu nnyumba eno.
He looked beautiful.	Yalabika nga mulungi.
That’s probably why.	Oboolyawo y’ensonga lwaki.
Not his or her house.	Si nnyumba ye oba ye.
It was pretty intense	Yali nnungi nnyo nga ya maanyi
Everyone has one.	Buli muntu alina emu.
But it is very important.	Naye kikulu nnyo.
I’m not sure why	Sikakasa lwaki
I didn’t want a teacher	Nnali saagala musomesa
They were downstairs.	Baali wansi.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
He will be, too.	Ajja kuba, naye.
I don’t have time to do this right now	Mu kiseera kino sirina budde kukola kino
Not everyone was happy.	Si buli muntu nti yali musanyufu.
I want to say you can but you can’t.	Njagala okugamba nti osobola naye tosobola.
But that’s not really the point.	Naye mu butuufu eyo si y’ensonga.
That he was very lonely.	Nti yali yekka nnyo.
Knowledge in practice.	Okumanya mu nkola.
I think you already know that	Ndowooza ekyo okimanyi dda
It’s the same, maybe.	Kye kimu, mpozzi.
He obviously wanted to.	Kya lwatu nti yali ayagala.
I will do the same.	Nze nange nja kukola kye kimu.
I just hope he has time for me right now	Nsuubira kyokka nti alina obudde gyendi mu kiseera kino
But you are not.	Naye ggwe si bwe kiri.
No, he actually wasn’t.	Nedda, mu butuufu si ye yali.
I really didn’t want to.	Mazima ddala nnali saagala.
I need to do this, I always have	Kino nneetaaga okukola, bulijjo nnina
I want to go to work	Njagala kugenda ku mulimu
You probably knew it.	Oboolyawo wali okimanyi.
He is my friend, and he comes with us.	Ye mukwano gwange, era ajja naffe.
And it’s true.	Era kituufu.
I have the money.	Nnina ssente.
This will never work.	Kino tekijja kukola n’akatono.
I need to talk to you.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe.
To me this is good.	Eri nze kino kirungi.
No, not maybe.	Nedda, si mpozzi.
He was happy.	Yali musanyufu.
But that wasn’t the plan.	Naye eyo si ye yali enteekateeka.
I think that’s the point.	Ndowooza eyo y’ensonga.
Maybe you do.	Mpozzi nga ggwe okola.
But he had no choice.	Naye yali talina kya kukola.
But it is very important.	Naye kikulu nnyo.
No, he had no interest in you.	Nedda, yali talina ky’ayagala ku ggwe.
It is very close.	Kiri kumpi nnyo.
In my case it was.	Mu mbeera yange bwe kyali.
I was both I was making dinner	Nnali ffembi nnali nkola ekyeggulo
No one lives alone.	Tewali abeera yekka.
He's doing well, you know.	Akola bulungi, omanyi.
He needs someone.	Yeetaaga omuntu.
He has everything he needs.	Alina buli kye yeetaaga.
The job probably.	Omulimu osanga.
However, there is one problem.	Kyokka, waliwo ekizibu kimu.
I can’t even talk to anyone about it	Sisobola na kwogera na muntu yenna ku nsonga eno
That’s what he has.	Ekyo alina.
Maybe we’ll get lucky.	Mpozzi tujja kufuna omukisa.
He left with nothing.	Yagenda nga talina ky’alina.
I will not speak again.	Sijja kuddamu kwogera.
That was the point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga.
Not for anyone.	Si lwa muntu yenna.
Really? 	Kituufu?
However, I have no problem.	Kyokka sirina buzibu.
You can go too.	Naawe osobola okugenda.
It was everywhere.	Kyali buli wamu.
In this case, too.	Mu mbeera eno, era.
I know you have to do this	Nkimanyi nti kino olina okukikola
But that’s just me.	Naye oyo nze nzekka.
However, that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Kyokka, ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri.
I guess it’s a good thing	Ntebereza nti kintu kirungi
Either way, it would be close.	Mu ngeri yonna, yandibadde kumpi.
However, I couldn’t do it	Kyokka nnali sisobola kukikola
He said something about.	Yayogera ekintu ku...
I don’t think anyone really knows.	Sirowooza nti ddala waliwo amanyi.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Era si kintu kibi.
I don’t want to be with anyone	Saagala kubeera na muntu yenna
But he felt the same way about me.	Naye naye yawulira bw’atyo ku nze.
I just hope it’s a good movie.	Nsuubira kyokka nti firimu nnungi.
I wonder how long he could last	Nneebuuza nti yali asobola okumala ebbanga ki
It comes down to attitude.	Kijja wansi ku ndowooza.
That was the right thing to do.	Ekyo kyali kituufu.
But you have to act quickly.	Naye olina okukola amangu.
I loved that house	Ennyumba eyo nnali njagala nnyo
I always have and always will	Bulijjo nnina era bulijjo nja kukikola
I'm not going with you.	Sigenda naawe.
He says no, he doesn't.	Agamba nti nedda.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
Not so much today.	Si nnyo leero.
Every single person is there .	Buli muntu omu ali eyo .
He can’t talk in the office.	Tasobola kwogera mu ofiisi.
He really does.	Akola ddala.
I know that he must always be, in his own way	Nkimanyi nti bulijjo alina okuba, mu ngeri ye
It was no problem at all.	Yali tewali buzibu bwonna.
I might do it better	Nnyinza okukikola obulungi
I was so scared	Nali ntya nnyo
I'm fine being alone	Ndi bulungi okubeera nzekka
I wanted a strong relationship	Nnali njagala mukwano gwa maanyi
I think that’s all we need.	Ndowooza ekyo kyokka kye twetaaga.
I really don’t know what’s going to happen.	Mu butuufu simanyi kigenda kubaawo.
It’s not the point.	Si ye nsonga.
All we are is good.	Kye tuli kirungi kyokka.
With this movie.	Ne firimu eno.
I want to make good time today	Njagala okukola obudde obulungi leero
I think this is a good thing.	Ndowooza kino kintu kirungi.
I think it might be the key	Ndowooza kiyinza okuba nga kye kikulu
No, nothing as of now.	Nedda, tewali nga bwe kiri kati.
And that’s what we are.	Era ekyo kye tuli.
Read.	Okusoma.
I was thinking the same thing	Nze nali ndowooza ekintu kye kimu
That’s the reason.	Ye nsonga.
Or to any of us.	Oba eri omuntu yenna ku ffe.
I should do the same.	Nze kye kimu nsaanidde okukola.
He didn’t seem to be.	Yalabika nga si bw’atyo.
I feel so much better now!	Mpulira bulungi nnyo kati!
It was something to do.	Kyali kintu kya kukola.
I didn’t know how to deal with this.	Kino nali simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukola ku nsonga eno.
He wouldn't want this.	Kino yandibadde tayagala.
I’ll do anything, whatever you want.	Nja kukola kyonna, kyonna ky’oyagala.
No one did anything.	Tewali yakola kintu kyonna.
I was very happy here with him in this place	Nali musanyufu nnyo wano naye mu kifo kino
I can’t talk to him right now	Sisobola kwogera naye mu kiseera kino
I couldn’t see anything	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna
I think it’s true, in many cases.	Ndowooza kituufu, mu mbeera nnyingi.
You as well as mine.	Ggwe nga bwe kiri ne wange.
I can’t keep doing this	Sisobola kusigala nga nkola kino
But the other one wasn’t.	Naye omulala si bwe kyali.
So far, so good.	Okutuuka wano, bulungi nnyo.
Almost no one knew, he said.	Kumpi tewali yali amanyi, bwe yagambye.
He's just a kid.	Ye mwana muto yekka.
I guess it will be alright	Ntebereza nti kijja kuba bulungi
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
We have so much on the agenda.	Tulina bingi nnyo ku agenda.
I have to get back to that	Nnina okudda ku ekyo
He didn’t want anyone to talk.	Yali tayagala muntu yenna ayogera.
It’s not a good situation.	Si mbeera nnungi.
That doesn’t matter now.	Ekyo si kikulu kati.
I was so scared.	Nali ntya nnyo.
We, we, we.	Ffe, ffe, ffe.
No, please don't.	Nedda, nsaba nedda.
No one wants that.	Ekyo tewali ayagala.
I hope he heard a lot	Nsuubira nti yawulira bingi
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
I wish you had	Njagala nnyo okuba nga olina
I was indeed very lucky	Mazima ddala nnali wa mukisa nnyo
They are definitely there.	Mazima ddala bali awo.
It’s difficult.	Kizibu.
No time constraints.	Tewali buzibu bwa budde.
He was nothing like you.	Yali talina kintu kyonna nga ggwe.
That’s not the point.	Eyo si y’ensonga.
This could just be me though.	Kino kiyinza okuba nze kyokka wadde.
I didn’t want to know more.	Nnali saagala kumanya bingi.
I want to know what that is	Njagala okumanya ekyo kye ki
I just need my brother with me	Nze nneetaaga muganda wange yekka nange
Now is not the time.	Kati si kye kiseera.
He didn’t want to talk, not to anyone.	Yali tayagala kwogera, si eri muntu yenna.
They were one.	Baali kimu.
I knew there was with him	Namanya nti waliwo naye
He can be with her.	Asobola okuba naye.
Or all night long.	Oba ekiro kyonna.
He will be in production.	Ajja kuba mu kukola.
I couldn’t see anyone	Nnali sisobola kulaba muntu yenna
I am not ready for this.	Kino siri mwetegefu.
I think that’s what it is.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kiri.
I could hardly believe it myself	Nze kennyini nnali sisobola bulungi kukkiriza
I don’t feel anything.	Sirina kye mpulira.
It was home.	Yali waka.
And we will go again.	Era tujja kuddamu okugenda.
But he didn’t think he could do it.	Naye yali talowooza nti asobola okukikola.
We’ll wait until morning.	Tujja kulinda okutuusa ku makya.
He looked so normal.	Yalabika nga wa bulijjo nnyo.
But this is why this is not true.	Naye eno y’ensonga lwaki kino si kituufu.
Now, this is not true.	Kati, kino si kituufu.
I had no idea where I was	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku kifo we nnali
But he doesn’t know the reason behind it.	Naye tamanyi nsonga eri emabega.
I think you could really be something	Ndowooza ddala oyinza okuba ekintu
I plan to go back to work tomorrow.	Nteekateeka kudda ku mulimu enkya.
This is good as far as it goes.	Kino kirungi okutuuka we kigenda.
This was.	Kino kyali...
I’m not here to win	Nze siri wano kuwangula
I was hoping you weren’t, but you are	Nali nsuubira nti toli, naye oli
I could barely eat dinner	Nnali nsobola bulungi okulya ekyeggulo
He had to say this thing.	Yalina okwogera ekintu kino.
I don’t know what it was exactly to this day.	Simanyi kye kyali ddala n’okutuusa leero.
I wonder how that could be he thought	Nze nneebuuza engeri ekyo gye kiyinza okuba bwe yalowooza
Or to anyone else.	Oba eri omuntu omulala yenna.
I love nights like that	Njagala nnyo ekiro ng’ekyo
But that really wasn’t the problem.	Naye ddala ekyo si kye kyali ekizibu.
I expect that to happen in about an hour	Nsuubira nti ekyo kijja kubaawo mu ssaawa nga emu
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu nga ekyo.
He is not from here.	Si wa wano.
But one problem at a time.	Naye ekizibu kimu ku kimu.
I don’t care about you	Sifaayo ku ggwe
Maybe he wasn’t.	Mpozzi nga si bwe yali.
She is a singer and actress	Muyimbi era muzannyi wa firimu
I have absolutely nothing to say	Sirina kye nnyinza kwogera ddala
Perhaps it is true.	Oboolyawo kituufu.
I know we will do it	Nkimanyi nti tujja kukikola
Everything will be fine.	Buli kimu kijja kuba kirungi.
I want to find a man, she thought	Njagala kufuna musajja, bwe yalowooza
I still can’t quite believe it’s happening.	N’okutuusa kati sisobola bulungi kukkiriza nti kigenda mu maaso.
Nothing so far.	Tewali kintu kyonna okutuusa kati.
I know what it was like	Nkimanyi bwe kyali
No one knows what will happen.	Tewali amanyi kijja kubaawo.
I was actually happy to be home	Mu butuufu nnali musanyufu okuba awaka
I need to talk to him immediately.	Nnina okwogera naye mu bwangu.
I will be in my office	Nja kubeera mu ofiisi yange
He looked asleep.	Yalabika nga yeebase.
He needed this.	Kino yali yeetaaga.
You will never be the same, you do something like this.	Tojja kubeera nga kye kimu, okola ekintu nga kino.
I don’t like that at all.	Ekyo sikyagala n’akatono.
Or it would be.	Oba kyandibadde.
It’s just a moment.	Akaseera katono ddala.
I won’t be home, tonight	Sijja kubeera waka, ekiro kino
We were all there.	Ffenna twali.
You are so close.	Oli kumpi nnyo.
I know it can happen with you	Nkimanyi nti kiyinza okubaawo naawe
I know it’s a little bit	Nkimanyi nti katono
He knew now that he should.	Yali akimanyi kati nti yandibadde akikola.
He won’t do it.	Tajja kukikola.
I wanted to say something back but didn’t know what	Nnali njagala okwogera ekintu okuddamu naye nga simanyi kiki
It’s easy to get.	Kyangu okufuna.
It’s not too bad,’ he said.	Si kibi nnyo,’ bwe yagambye.
But it seems to be true.	Naye kirabika kituufu.
While you are in place.	Nga oli mu kifo.
I really hope she’s okay	Nsuubira ddala nti ajja kuba bulungi
In this case, that doesn’t really matter.	Mu mbeera eno, ekyo mu butuufu si kikulu.
I have a lot to do this weekend	Nnina bingi bye nkola wiikendi eno
It’s just in me.	Kiri mu nze kyokka.
And it isn’t.	Era si bwe kiri.
He is not at work.	Tali ku mulimu.
It is not the case here.	Wano si bwe kiri.
But no one knows what will happen.	Naye tewali amanyi kijja kubaawo.
I didn’t know you were coming until this morning	Nali simanyi nti ojja okutuusa enkya ya leero
I should have seen something	Nnali nsaanidde okulaba ekintu
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
Or maybe someone else will.	Oba oboolyawo omuntu omulala ajja kukikola.
I don’t know about this.	Simanyi ku kino.
No mention of that yet.	Tewali kwogera ku nsonga eyo n'okutuusa kati.
It’s a good movie.	Firimu nnungi.
He knew it himself.	Ye kennyini yali akimanyi.
It’s easy to see why	Kyangu okulaba ensonga lwaki
It’s not my problem.	Si kizibu kyange.
It seems perfectly normal.	Kirabika nga kya bulijjo ddala.
He wasn’t thinking clearly.	Yali talowooza bulungi.
I know she is alone	Nkimanyi nti ali yekka
I was so glad he was doing this	Nali musanyufu nnyo nti yali akola kino
Being normal.	Okubeera wa bulijjo.
Of something.	Wa kintu.
But you don’t have to.	Naye tolina kukikola.
That’s good for that one.	Ekyo kirungi eri oyo.
No one lives here for long.	Tewali abeera wano okumala ebbanga ddene.
I think that’s true	Ndowooza ekyo kituufu
I couldn’t work out why.	Nnali sisobola kukola ku nsonga lwaki.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
Working every day.	Okukola buli lunaku.
You are, it’s not.	Ggwe oli, si bwe kiri.
I have no problems driving	Sirina buzibu bwonna mu kuvuga
He is talking to me.	Ayogera nange.
He told me he had.	Yang’amba nti alina.
Now I can’t go to jail	Kati sisobola kugenda mu kkomera
And then that’s not the same thing.	Era awo ekyo si kye kimu.
I feel at home there.	Mpulira nga ndi waka eyo.
This is the reason why.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki.
That's why he's doing this.	Y'ensonga lwaki kino akikola.
No, it won’t happen.	Nedda, tekijja kubaawo.
That would really be something.	Ekyo ddala kyandibadde kintu.
It’s very, very good for us.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo gye tuli.
Whoever, or whatever that was.	Oyo yenna, oba kyonna ekyo kye kyali.
He needed to go.	Yali yeetaaga okugenda.
Always a person.	Bulijjo muntu.
I wasn’t really sure	Mu butuufu nnali sikakasa
I have a lot to say.	Nnina bingi bye njagala okwogera.
In fact, you go with us.	Mu butuufu, ogenda naffe.
As soon as.	Amangu ddala nga...
He is ' my brother.	Ye ' muganda wange.
We are both fine.	Ffembi tuli bulungi.
Almost everyone is sick.	Kumpi buli muntu mulwadde.
The thing is, the thing is.	Ekintu kiri nti, ekintu kiri nti.
I didn’t know who he was at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi ani
I was thinking only of myself	Nali ndowooza ku nze nzekka
He couldn’t tell.	Yali tasobola kumanya.
I’ll have an early dinner	Nja kulya ekyeggulo nga bukyali
I didn’t even know who	Nnali simanyi na ani
But it’s not my business.	Naye si nsonga yange.
You would love it.	Wandyagadde nnyo.
Everyone looked good.	Buli omu yalabika bulungi.
That was a bad time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kibi.
He needed to go home.	Yali yeetaaga okudda eka.
You really can’t win.	Mazima ddala tosobola kuwangula.
I think that’s my dad	Ndowooza oyo ye taata wange
But there was no one.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna.
No one came.	Tewali yajja.
Tali can’t do it.	Tali tasobola kukikola.
I am powerless	Nze sirina maanyi
However, he can barely speak.	Kyokka, tasobola bulungi kwogera.
That was his character.	Eyo ye yali engeri ye.
I can’t say much about it	Siyinza kwogera bingi ku nsonga eyo
I will just accept the situation	Nja kumala kukkiriza mbeera
I thought it was good	Nalowooza nti kyali kirungi
Now it’s his turn.	Kati kye kiseera kye.
And he did it.	Era yakikola.
You can always find another job.	Bulijjo osobola okufuna omulimu omulala.
Not too much of it.	Si bingi nnyo.
Everything was in perfect condition	Buli kimu kyali mu mbeera nnungi
I thought it was him for a while	Nalowooza nti ye ye okumala akaseera
I have to answer everything	Nnina okuddamu buli kimu
It was just there.	Kyali awo kyokka.
It may have been the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kyali.
He can't 'believe.	Tasobola 'kukkiriza.
Maybe it’s real.	Mpozzi nga kya ddala.
That's what you want.	Ekyo ky'oyagala.
In his office.	Mu ofiisi ye.
That's probably why we were so close.	Oboolyawo eyo lwaki twali ba mukwano nnyo.
I love it back there	Njagala nnyo emabega awo
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
This just isn’t the case.	Kino kyokka si bwe kiri.
He doesn’t know how to try harder.	Tamanyi ngeri ya kugezaako nnyo.
It was there.	Kyali awo.
He could do anything	Yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna
It was the right thing to do.	Kyali kintu kituufu okukola.
He was so happy to be with her, now.	Yali musanyufu nnyo okubeera naye, kati.
I think he would like a friend	Ndowooza yandiyagadde mukwano gwe
You have you.	Olina ggwe.
I feel like it’s happening a little bit more each day	Mpulira nga kigenda mu maaso katono buli lunaku
I think that’s very important	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo
It could be something.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu.
I wasn’t sure if it was good or bad	Nali sikakasa oba kyali kirungi oba kibi
I knew you would come back	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kudda
Maybe we all are.	Mpozzi ffenna bwe tuli.
It was really overwhelming.	Ddala kyali kizibu nnyo.
I hope it isn’t.	Nsuubira nti si bwe kiri.
I have a problem too	Nange nnina ekizibu
But it won’t do it.	Naye tekijja kukikola.
Next week.	Wiiki ejja.
Now this is what you want to know.	Kati kino ky’oyagala okumanya.
I thought backwards.	Nalowooza emabega.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
He didn’t have time.	Yali talina budde.
I like to swim though.	Njagala nnyo okuwuga wadde.
Maybe this week it will.	Mpozzi wiiki eno kijja kubaawo.
But we are not like that.	Naye ffe si bwe tuli.
No, it’s not a car.	Nedda, si mmotoka.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I knew what we needed	Nnali mmanyi kye twali twetaaga
I can’t work without my job	Sisobola kukola nga sirina mulimu gwange
And the picture is real.	Era ekifaananyi kya ddala.
I will never be able to play again	Sijja kuddamu kusobola kuzannya
Maybe that’s why he’s sick now.	Mpozzi y’ensonga lwaki kati mulwadde.
But that was my point.	Naye eyo ye yali ensonga yange.
I need it so much.	Nze nneetaaga nnyo.
I knew that to be true	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi nti kituufu
I wonder what he was doing in my room	Nze nneebuuza kye yali akola mu kisenge kyange
I didn’t know what he was at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi kye yali
He wasn’t like that.	Yali si bwe yali.
Obviously not here.	Kya lwatu si wano.
I guess he was interested	Ntebereza nti yali ayagala nnyo
He can’t make friends.	Tasobola kukola mukwano.
Or not a man.	Oba si musajja.
I need to know why he would do this	Nnina okumanya lwaki yandikoze kino
I hope we will go.	Nsuubira nti tujja kugenda.
It’s the same for you.	Kye kimu ku ggwe.
I will never do it again	Sijja kuddamu kukikola
I want to go with him	Njagala kugenda naye
Good to talk to you.	Kirungi okwogera naawe.
I have food, but he doesn't	Nnina emmere naye talina
I need to be on time	Nze nneetaaga okutuuka mu budde
I was so ready to consider his situation	Nali mwetegefu nnyo okulowooza ku mbeera ye
But it may be true.	Naye kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
As it should be.	Nga bwe kyandibadde.
You don’t have anyone.	Tolina muntu yenna.
I knew almost nothing about him	Kumpi nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye
He wanted to know.	Yali ayagala okumanya.
I think he knows	Ndowooza nti amanyi
I didn’t want that at all	Ekyo nnali saagala n’akatono
I can work this out	Kino nsobola okukola ku nsonga eno
That would be something if you had the time.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu singa oba olina obudde.
I thought it was a good thing to say	Nalowooza nti kyali kirungi okwogera
Someone can be almost anything	Omuntu ayinza okuba kumpi ekintu kyonna
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
Or in my office.	Oba mu ofiisi yange.
This was his house.	Eno ye yali nnyumba ye.
I couldn’t really do it.	Mu butuufu nnali sisobola kukikola.
You are, or you are not, and everyone knows it.	Oli, oba toli, era buli omu akimanyi.
I don’t care about you.	Sifaayo ku ggwe.
But it’s difficult.	Naye kizibu.
It's pretty bad though.	Kibi nnyo wadde.
We should know better.	Tusaanidde okumanya obulungi.
It’s not even really a plan.	Si wadde mu butuufu enteekateeka.
I knew he wouldn’t do it himself either	Namanya nti naye tajja kukikola ye kennyini
So did my dad, apparently.	Bwatyo ne taata wange bwe yakola, kirabika.
Even if he’d rather not.	Ne bwe yandibadde asinga obutakola.
I don’t know how long.	Simanyi bbanga ki.
I have no idea what to expect	Sirina kye mmanyi kye nsuubira
But we don’t have to do this.	Naye kino tetulina kukikola.
I won’t do just anything, or anyone	Sijja kukola kintu kyonna kyokka, oba omuntu yenna
What he had he didn’t want.	Kye yalina yali tayagala.
There is nothing simple about it.	Tewali kintu kyangu ku nsonga eyo.
I think he’ll be just fine.	Ndowooza ajja kuba bulungi nnyo.
We have to get out of this place.	Tulina okuva mu kifo kino.
I know he is telling the truth	Nkimanyi ayogera mazima
I knew it would happen	Nali nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo
I needed a little more	Nnali nneetaaga katono nnyo
However, I couldn’t do that	Kyokka ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola
I’ve been ready to get that food	Nze mbadde mwetegefu okufuna emmere eyo
Not one person.	Si muntu omu.
Dad can’t.	Taata tasobola.
There is no such issue.	Tewali nsonga eyo.
It was that moment.	Kyali kiseera ekyo.
I know you love shopping	Nkimanyi nti oyagala nnyo okugula ebintu
I have to tell someone	Nnina okubuulira omuntu
His brother is so so.	Muganda we bw’atyo bw’atyo.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I couldn’t believe he was doing this	Nali sisobola kukkiriza nti kino akikola
So far that’s what it is.	N’okutuusa kati ekyo kye kiri.
I have a job.	Nnina omulimu.
I wanted to see if he was okay	Nnali njagala okulaba oba yali bulungi
At the time, he couldn’t.	Mu kiseera ekyo, yali tasobola.
But it’s true.	Naye kituufu.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
I always have been too	Bulijjo nange mbadde
There is no right place.	Tewali kifo kyonna kituufu.
I couldn’t talk to him about it	Nnali sisobola kwogera naye ku nsonga eyo
How could he .	Yali asobola atya .
And he is not a child.	Era si mwana muto.
In practice, it’s very difficult.	Mu nkola, kizibu nnyo.
You can’t help everyone.	Tosobola kuyamba buli muntu.
But he was fine.	Naye yali bulungi.
He can do anything	Asobola okukola ekintu kyonna
I just know too well	Nze mmanyi bulungi nnyo kyokka
He went to his room.	Yagenda mu kisenge kye.
He seemed to be.	Yalabika nga bwe kiri.
And the reason was a reason.	Era ensonga yali nsonga.
I wish it was more complicated	Njagala nnyo singa kyali kizibu nnyo
Dad isn’t going.	Taata tagenda.
I knew exactly where it was	Nali mmanyi bulungi gye kyali
I don’t know exactly	Simanyi bulungi
I wasn’t sure it was him	Nali sikakasa nti ye yali
I love your opinion	Njagala nnyo endowooza yo
He could do this better	Kino yali asobola okukola obulungi
It was a common sense.	Yali ndowooza ya bulijjo.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
I wonder if they are friends	Nze nneebuuza oba ba mukwano
Perhaps he does.	Oboolyawo akola bw’atyo.
I can’t wait to see this	Siyinza kulinda kulaba kino
All of this is down here.	Kyonna kino kiri wansi wano.
He would have done it.	Yandikoze.
And then this.	Era awo kino.
Tomorrow is the wedding.	Enkya ye mbaga.
I really wonder the very same thing	Nze ddala nneebuuza ekintu kye kimu ennyo
Anything, just pray for anything.	Ekintu kyonna, nsaba ekintu kyonna kyokka.
It's coming.	Kijja.
I’m absolutely fine.	Nze ndi bulungi ddala.
The night is coming.	Ekiro kigenda okutuuka.
He had no interest in his work.	Yali talina ky’ayagala ku mulimu gwe.
That picture seems accurate.	Ekifaananyi ekyo kirabika kituufu.
I wanted to make sure everyone was happy	Nnali njagala okulaba nga buli muntu musanyufu
He wasn’t thinking about himself.	Yali talowooza ku ye kennyini.
However, not exactly as we shall see.	Kyokka, si ddala nga bwe tujja okulaba.
I didn’t know that thing	Ekintu ekyo nnali simanyi
Not me and you.	Si nze naawe.
I knew nothing about him.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
But that’s the problem.	Naye ekyo kye kizibu.
Well! 	Bulungi!
not really.	si ddala.
He hoped it would never come back.	Yali asuubira nti tekijja kuddamu kudda.
He has been working.	Abadde akola.
I have one problem with this	Nnina ekizibu kimu mu kino
I wonder what he saw	Nneebuuza kye yalaba
He almost did.	Yali katono akole.
There is money here.	Wano waliwo ssente.
In fact, they were just here.	Mu butuufu, baali wano kyokka.
He's a very nice guy.	Ggaayi mulungi nnyo.
The point is this.	Ensonga eri nti eno.
It could be me.	Kiyinza okuba nze.
I can’t believe it’s real	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ddala
You really are.	Ddala ggwe oli.
I can’t wait to be with you again	Siyinza kulinda kuddamu kubeera naawe
I was young and didn’t know what to say	Nnali muto nga simanyi kya kwogera
Even today.	N’okutuusa leero.
He wanted to go.	Yali ayagala kugenda.
And we needed it.	Era twali twetaaga.
In fact, it looks great.	Mu butuufu, kirabika bulungi nnyo.
They were there.	Baali awo.
I love dogs too.	Nze nange njagala nnyo embwa.
Or you might be like.	Oba oyinza okuba nga.
He wanted another one.	Yali ayagala omulala.
Not that it was good, though.	Kyokka si nti kyali kirungi.
I wonder if it will ever happen again	Nneebuuza oba nga kijja kuddamu
A little, but that doesn’t matter right now	Katono, naye ekyo si kikulu mu kiseera kino
My point, however, is this.	Kyokka ensonga yange eri nti eno.
I actually think ahead a lot.	Mu butuufu ndowooza nnyo mu maaso.
I couldn’t replace myself	Nnali sisobola kudda mu kifo kyange
Not even with you.	Si wadde naawe.
I don’t like that.	Ekyo sikyagala.
It wasn’t him she was afraid of.	Si ye gwe yali atya.
Money is money.	Ssente ssente.
It is today.	Kiri leero.
I know it’s really good for you to be with him	Nkimanyi nti ddala ggwe okubeera naye kirungi
He should have known it wouldn’t work.	Yandibadde akimanyi nti tekijja kukola.
I expected so much more.	Nali nsuubira bingi nnyo.
You are really very happy.	Ddala oli musanyufu nnyo.
I could be in jail right now	Nnyinza okuba mu kkomera mu kiseera kino
I want to have another chance.	Njagala okufuna omukisa omulala.
I certainly don’t think so.	Mazima ddala sirowooza.
I thought he did with you but no	Nalowooza nti yakola naawe naye nedda
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
It was quick and easy.	Kyali kyangu era nga kyangu.
Anything like that.	Ekintu kyonna nga ekyo.
I love it here.	Njagala nnyo wano.
I was fine though	Nali bulungi wadde
Not at all, of course.	Si bwe kiri, ddala.
Definitely next week.	Mazima ddala wiiki ejja.
But it’s not exactly the same.	Naye si kye kimu ddala.
I used to live here.	Nze nali mbeera wano.
I love the guy	Njagala nnyo ggaayi
I’m still from there	Nze n’okutuusa kati ndi wa eyo
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
He was obviously off duty.	Kya lwatu nti yali tali ku mulimu.
I’m afraid to move on	Ntya okugenda mu maaso
I didn’t know who it was	Nnali simanyi ani
It was time to go.	Kyali kiseera kya kugenda.
He was the one who was speaking.	Ye yali ayogera.
He could not do that himself.	Ekyo ye kennyini yali tasobola kukikola.
I can’t find what he was then and what I am now.	Sisobola kufuna kye yali mu kiseera ekyo era nze kati kiki.
I didn’t have much time	Nnali sirina budde bungi
I’m glad you’re here	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano
It’s not just for me.	Si gyendi nzekka.
But he also wanted to move on.	Naye era yali ayagala kugenda mu maaso.
I couldn’t go back to that house	Nnali sisobola kudda mu nnyumba eyo
I need to do that again	Nze nneetaaga okuddamu okukola ekyo
He wasn’t a kid.	Yali si mwana muto.
He didn’t like everyone, of course.	Yali tayagala buli muntu, ddala.
I need to go get help	Nze nneetaaga okugenda okufuna obuyambi
I knew you would come.	Namanya nti ojja kujja.
I can’t do this right now	Kino sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino
I’m what I need from you	Nze kye nneetaaga okuva gy’oli
In fact, this is not quite true.	Mu butuufu kino si kituufu nnyo.
He wanted to play as well.	Yali ayagala kuzannya nga naye.
I feel a little better now.	Mpulira bulungi katono kati.
That’s what I do.	Kye nkola.
I didn’t know myself	Nze kennyini nnali simanyi
I think about what he said	Ndowooza ku bye yayogera
It’s not about being the best.	Si kya kubeera asinga.
I can’t talk much.	Nze sisobola kwogera nnyo.
I have to be with him.	Nnina okuba naye.
You would be there too.	Naawe wandibadde awo.
I have to say that was good	Nnina okugamba nti ekyo kyali kirungi
You're not me'	Ggwe si nze'.
We have a lot to do.	Tulina bingi bye tulina okukola.
I won’t talk to you	Sijja kwogera naawe
I will never be able to do this.	Kino sijja kusobola kukikola.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka kino si bwe kiri.
My father knows that. 	Ekyo taata akimanyi. 
What he would do.	Kye yandikoze.
I won’t do it now.	Sijja kukikola kati.
I really have to go home.	Mazima ddala nnina okudda eka.
I think we can do it	Ndowooza tusobola okukikola
You want to know what’s going on.	Oyagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso.
But he is my best friend.	Naye ye mukwano gwange asinga.
However, I wasn’t so sure	Kyokka, nnali sikakasa nnyo
However, it was very difficult.	Kyokka, kyali kizibu nnyo.
This is what we are.	Kino kye tuli.
I don’t want to be with him.	Saagala kubeera naye.
I have something to say	Nnina kye njagala okwogera
You are not my friend.	Ggwe toli mukwano gwange.
I wasn’t going to do much today	Leero nali sigenda kukola nnyo
This will be difficult.	Kino kijja kuba kizibu.
I was young at the time, you know.	Nnali muto mu kiseera ekyo, omanyi.
Only my girlfriend knew.	Muganzi wange yekka ye yali amanyi.
I'm not sure how .	Sikakasa ngeri ki .
It was what he was.	Kyali kye yali.
You are a woman.	Oli mukyala.
I needed a job and money.	Nnali nneetaaga omulimu ne ssente.
I'm not sure which, actually.	Sikakasa ki, mu butuufu.
However, it is not entirely true.	Kyokka, si kituufu ddala.
But he didn't think it would happen here.	Naye yali talowooza nti wano kijja kubaawo.
That’s not true, but it doesn’t matter.	Ekyo si kituufu naye si kikulu.
I think it will be good for you	Ndowooza kijja kuba kirungi gy’oli
He knew it was him.	Yali akimanyi nti ye.
I love to read	Njagala nnyo okusoma
That’s what he loves.	Ekyo ky’ayagala ennyo.
I’m not in this for the money.	Siri mu kino lwa ssente.
Lots of stuff here	Ebintu bingi wano
Here we are in that position.	Wano tuli mu kifo ekyo.
I thought this was it	Nalowooza nti kino kye kyali
It is very important now.	Kikulu nnyo kati.
I thought he and I were friends	Nalowooza nti nze naye twali ba mukwano
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I won’t come back with you	Sijja kudda naawe
I had been ready.	Nnali mbadde mwetegefu.
You certainly can.	Mazima ddala osobola.
i'm not sure that.	sikakasa nti.
I know we’ll be fine together	Nkimanyi nti tujja kuba bulungi nga tuli wamu
This may be close.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kiri kumpi.
I feel better already	Mpulira bulungi dda
I will definitely do it	Nze ddala nja kukikola
I can’t do anything	Sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
I wanted to be like him	Nnali njagala kubeera nga ye
I had no idea how to actually do it.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri gye nnyinza kukikola mu butuufu.
I didn’t want to be there	Nnali saagala kubeerawo
In this case, we have.	Mu mbeera eno, tulina.
It’s what we are.	Kye kye tuli.
He doesn’t have to say much.	Talina kwogera bingi.
What a powerful situation.	Nga mbeera ya maanyi.
I don’t even know why.	Simanyi na lwaki.
I didn’t know why he was trying so hard	Nnali simanyi lwaki yali agezaako nnyo
Anyone can do that.	Ekyo omuntu yenna asobola okukikola.
I thought we could eat together in the room	Nalowooza nti tusobola okulya ffenna mu kisenge
I didn’t have a good attitude	Nnali sirina ndowooza nnungi
I wanted things in me	Nnali njagala ebintu mu nze
It was pretty good though.	Yali nnungi nnyo wadde.
I couldn’t eat anyway	Mu ngeri yonna nnali sisobola kulya
He hasn't seen anything about that process yet.	Tannaba kulaba kintu kyonna ku nkola eyo.
And that would be great.	Era ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
One on each side.	Omu ku buli ludda.
I am a doctor myself	Nze kennyini ndi musawo
This is certainly not unusual.	Mazima ddala kino si kya bulijjo.
And every congregation.	Era buli kibiina.
I'm not even sure if it's safe to do so.	Sikakasa wadde oba si kya bulabe okukikola.
He wants to eat again.	Ayagala kuddamu kulya.
He was almost ready.	Yali kumpi mwetegefu.
It seems like you are the only one.	Kirabika ggwe wekka.
I have been busy busy busy	Mbadde bbize bbize bbize
I belonged to the other guy	Nze nali wa ggaayi omulala
I was strong and could swim	Nnali wa maanyi era nga nsobola okuwuga
He told me it was okay.	Yang’amba nti tewali buzibu.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
That’s what you want.	Ekyo ky’oyagala.
He is ready to work.	Mwetegefu okukola.
I didn’t even know what day it was	Nnali simanyi na lunaku ki
I loved that one.	Nnali njagala nnyo eyo.
Not apparently now.	Si kirabika kati.
No one was anyone.	Tewali yali muntu yenna.
I don’t like it more than you do.	Sikyagala okusinga ggwe.
I think I’m going to get one	Ndowooza ng’enda kufuna emu
Or why not.	Oba lwaki nedda.
That was hard, really hard.	Ekyo kyali kizibu, kizibu ddala.
No one spoke for a moment.	Tewali yayogera wadde akaseera katono.
We have to do it ourselves.	Ffe tulina okukikola ffekka.
But it wasn’t what he wanted.	Naye si kye yali ayagala.
I thought you would be in the hospital	Nalowooza nti ojja kuba mu ddwaaliro
He has no problems, yet.	Talina buzibu, n’okutuusa kati.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Simanyi kigenda mu maaso.
The picture doesn’t come.	Ekifaananyi tekijja.
Good to talk to you.	Kirungi okwogera naawe.
I really wanted to.	Nze ddala nnali njagala.
I think we have to talk.	Ndowooza tulina okwogera.
He may be somewhere now.	Ayinza okuba nga waliwo we ali kati.
I wasn’t proving anything to anyone	Nze nali sirina kye nkakasa eri omuntu yenna
You are a very lucky little kid.	Oli mwana muto wa mukisa nnyo.
Everyone was at home.	Buli omu yali waka.
I knew she wasn’t ready	Namanya nti yali si mwetegefu
I can be anyone right now	Nsobola okuba omuntu yenna mu kiseera kino
I don’t care about money	Sifaayo ku ssente
I wanted to know if anyone else was here	Nnali njagala okumanya oba wano waliwo omuntu omulala yenna
Close, very close.	Kumpi, kumpi nnyo.
However, this is the point.	Kyokka eno y’ensonga.
I need time to think	Nneetaaga obudde okulowooza
Or reading a lot.	Oba okusoma ennyo.
However, we have no choice in the matter.	Kyokka, tetulina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo.
I feel like there is	Mpulira nga waliwo
I think it’s a good thing.	Ndowooza kintu kirungi.
Perhaps he was telling the truth.	Oboolyawo yali ayogera mazima.
But he couldn’t tell.	Naye yali tasobola kumanya.
I know you have one	Nkimanyi nti olina emu
The plan was already in place	Enteekateeka yali yakola dda
He was her friend.	Yali mukwano gwe.
But this is all he did.	Naye kino kye kyokka kye yakola.
Too close, he thought.	Kumpi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
I didn’t know who he was	Nnali simanyi ani gwe yali
Now I won’t,’ he said.	Kati sijja kukikola,’ bwe yagambye.
That’s what I do.	Kye nkola.
Down with me.	Wansi nange.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
You will be yourself again soon.	Ojja kuddamu okuba ggwe kennyini mu bbanga ttono.
He thought she was his wife.	Yalowooza nti ye mukyala we.
I already knew what he was thinking	Nali mmanyi dda kye yali alowooza
He needed to think.	Yali yeetaaga okulowooza.
I wanted to get out of there, and to do it now.	Nnali njagala okuva awo, era okukikola kati.
I couldn’t wait to go home	Nnali sisobola kulinda kudda waka
We are very strong.	Tuli ba maanyi nnyo.
I really like that one.	Njagala nnyo eyo.
I feel the same about you	Nze mpulira kye kimu ku ggwe
I'll stay there.	Nja kusigala eyo.
I wasn’t in shape to drive	Nze nali siri mu mbeera ya kuvuga
It was really intense	Ddala kyali kya maanyi nnyo
I wanted to be alone with you for a while	Nnali njagala kubeera naawe nzekka okumala akaseera
I think he did a pretty good job	Ndowooza yakola omulimu omulungi ennyo
I have nothing to fear.	Nze sirina kye ntya.
But that’s not the point.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga.
We should all go out to eat.	Ffenna tusaanidde okugenda okulya.
I really do like you	Nze ddala nkola nga ggwe
We don’t have any problems.	Tetulina buzibu bwonna.
I have an agenda.	Nnina agenda.
I couldn’t win at anything	Nnali sisobola kuwangula mu kintu kyonna
I might be able to help	Nnyinza okuyamba
He said it wasn’t.	Yagambye nti si bwe kiri.
I don’t like school here	Sikyagala ssomero wano
And they were home.	Era baali waka.
I need to go to the hospital	Nze nneetaaga okugenda mu ddwaaliro
I’m the other one.	Nze omulala.
You know, like, work.	Omanyi, nga, omulimu.
From the point of view.	Okuva mu nsonga.
But that’s not entirely true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu ddala.
I didn’t really know what it was	Nnali simanyi bulungi kiki kye kyali
There isn’t even one.	Tewali wadde emu.
That is the only truth.	Ekyo kye kituufu kyokka.
It’s easier this way.	Kyangu mu ngeri eno.
Not a week.	Si wiiki emu.
It doesn’t matter at all.	Si nsonga n’akatono.
We need all the help we can get.	Twetaaga obuyambi bwonna bwe tusobola okufuna.
Right now, this is what’s happening.	Mu kiseera kino, kino kye kigenda mu maaso.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
He wanted to talk to me.	Yali ayagala okwogera nange.
You know, he does.	Omanyi, akola.
But not like you.	Naye si nga ggwe.
I’m going to get a book.	Ngenda kufuna ekitabo.
I don’t know what’s going to happen to this house.	Simanyi kiki ekigenda okutuuka ku nnyumba eno.
He could not speak for a moment.	Yali tasobola kwogera wadde akaseera katono.
For the truth.	Ku mazima.
Not even me.	Si wadde nze.
I was very curious	Nnali njagala nnyo okumanya
I'll try it.	Nja kugezaako.
I doubt he will	Nbuusabuusa nti ajja kukikola
I wanted to know he was safe	Nnali njagala okumanya nti talina bulabe
I wonder what he wants	Nze nneebuuza ky’ayagala
I hope you like it	Nsuubira nti oyagala
Not even you.	Si wadde ggwe.
And we all have that.	Era ekyo ffenna tulina.
But it’s not him.	Naye si ye.
I was so alone, so scared	Nali nzekka nnyo, nga ntya nnyo
Here, not so much.	Wano, si nnyo.
I didn’t know what he wanted	Nze nali simanyi kye yali ayagala
But this won’t work.	Naye kino tekijja kukola.
In a sense this is true and important.	Mu ngeri emu kino kituufu era kikulu.
I know it and you know it	Nze nkimanyi era naawe okimanyi
However, probably not.	Kyokka, oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
Not that that’s necessarily a bad thing.	Si nti ekyo kituufu nti kintu kibi.
I’m going to go to the police	Ngenda kugenda ku poliisi
I wish everyone didn’t know	Njagala buli omu tamanyi
He is a man who knows what he wants.	Ye musajja amanyi ky’ayagala.
Behind him.	Emabega we.
And, he wanted to be there.	Era, yali ayagala kubeerawo.
I could do nothing without help.	Tewali kye nnali nsobola kukola nga sirina buyambi.
I'll do it tonight.	Nja kukikola ekiro kino.
I was everything and everyone.	Nze nali buli kimu era buli muntu.
More than you, a lot.	Okusinga ggwe, bingi.
It’s time to get something.	Kye kiseera okufuna ekintu.
And that’s really important, that’s very important.	Era ekyo kikulu ddala, ekyo kikulu nnyo.
I love my job	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwange
This can happen to any player.	Kino kiyinza okutuuka ku muzannyi yenna.
I think he looks good	Ndowooza alabika bulungi
This is obviously a very difficult thing to do.	Kino kirabika kintu kizibu nnyo okukola.
You can’t do anything.	Tosobola kukola kintu kyonna.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
Maybe that won’t happen	Mpozzi ekyo tekijja kubaawo
This was going to happen.	Kino kyali kigenda kubaawo.
Apparently this was not the case.	Kirabika kino si bwe kyali.
I guess he didn’t know it was coming	Ntebereza yali tamanyi nti kijja
Talking about what he loved.	Okwogera ku bye yali ayagala ennyo.
I don’t care about anyone but you	Nze sifaayo ku muntu yenna okuggyako ggwe
I was very young at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali muto nnyo.
We will be alone again.	Tujja kuddamu okuba ffekka.
I couldn’t wait.	Nnali sisobola kulinda.
I wasn’t ready to talk to him	Nnali siri mwetegefu kwogera naye
It was mine.	Kyali kyange.
I love how strong you are	Njagala nnyo engeri gy’oli wa maanyi
You can't .	Ggwe tosobola .
You're here.	Oli wano.
I know exactly what is going on.	Nze mmanyi bulungi ekigenda mu maaso.
Nothing could be simpler.	Tewali kiyinza kuba kyangu okusinga ekyo.
As he was.	Nga bwe yali.
I had no idea about it	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku nsonga eyo
It wasn’t what he needed.	Si kye yali yeetaaga.
That is exactly what it is.	Ekyo ddala kye kiri.
I think there is work here	Ndowooza wano waliwo omulimu
I couldn’t eat at all either	Nange nnali sisobola kulya n’akatono
I was feeling good	Nnali mpulira bulungi
And herein lies the problem.	Era wano we wali ekizibu.
He could find someone.	Yali asobola okufuna omuntu.
We’ll know soon enough.	Tujja kumanya mu bbanga ttono.
He could get that way.	Yali asobola okufuna mu ngeri eyo.
I don’t think you will.	Sirowooza nti ojja kukikola.
I think he needs you	Ndowooza yeetaaga ggwe
And on every side.	Ne ku buli ludda.
He couldn't say why.	Yali tasobola kwogera lwaki.
Not like my father.	Si nga taata wange.
I guess that’s the problem now	Ntebereza nti ekyo kye kizibu kati
There is nothing wrong with them.	Tewali kibi kyonna gye bali.
And he's not here.	Era tali wano.
I don’t know if he has or not.	Simanyi oba abadde oba nedda.
I’m in her room now.	Nze ndi mu kisenge kye kati.
In a sense he was.	Mu ngeri emu yali.
Money is not the problem.	Ssente si kizibu.
I can’t quite believe it either	Nange sisobola bulungi kukkiriza
I always do that too	Bulijjo nange nkola ekyo
All but one.	Byonna okuggyako omu.
I’m not going to do that	Ekyo sigenda kukikola
I didn’t know he would come back	Nnali simanyi nti ajja kudda
I’m the only one who does it for all of us	Nze ffenna nzekka akikola
I have somewhere to go	Nnina we nnina okugenda
And it was very important to move forward.	Era kyali kikulu nnyo okugenda mu maaso.
It seems a complicated problem.	Kirabika kizibu kizibu.
I wanted it more than anything	Nnali njagala okusinga ekintu kyonna
I hope you might as well.	Nsuubira nti oyinza nga bwe kiri.
But it’s not something that actually is.	Naye si kintu ekyo kye kiri mu butuufu.
I know that this is the truth	Nkimanyi nti kino kye kituufu
So he goes alone.	Bwatyo agenda yekka.
But he is strong.	Naye wa maanyi.
I know what you were thinking	Nze mmanyi kye wali olowooza
And maybe he isn’t.	Era mpozzi si bw’atyo.
He didn’t know who it was.	Yali tamanyi ani.
It’s very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo, nnyo.
I want to talk to you	Njagala okwogera naawe
In it he talks about his practice.	Mu yo ayogera ku nkola ye.
I was thinking the same thing before.	Nze nali ndowooza kye kimu emabegako.
But now.	Naye kati.
I should be going anyway	Nze nsaanidde okuba nga ngenda mu ngeri yonna
I had no idea about this	Kino nnali sirina kye mmanyi
I know you know it too.	Nkimanyi nti naawe okimanyi.
I know he hadn’t though	Nkimanyi nti yali talina wadde
I think she was a young woman	Ndowooza yali mukyala muto
Not that he wanted that.	Si nti yali ayagala bw’atyo.
That indeed, is the case.	Ekyo ddala, bwe kiri.
I should be there	Nze nsaanidde okuba nga ndi awo
I’m not down at all.	Nze siri wansi n’akatono.
I’m working alone	Nze nkola nzekka
To me you are.	Eri nze ggwe oli.
This is the only one.	Kino kye kimu kyokka.
I was the only one he said	Nze nali nzekka bwe yagamba
I really, really do.	Nze ddala, ddala nkola.
I didn’t know anything	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi
I thought it just had to be you	Nalowooza nti kyalina okuba ggwe kyokka
I know that was him.	Nkimanyi nti oyo ye yali ye.
It wasn’t that important.	Si bwe kyali kikulu.
I knew that was what he needed from me	Namanya nti ekyo kye yali yeetaaga okuva gyendi
He wasn't as strong.	Yali si wa maanyi nga ye.
I just want to be me.	Njagala kubeera nze kyokka.
That’s what we have to think about.	Ekyo kye tulina okulowooza.
I was very nervous before	Nali ntya nnyo emabegako
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
I was probably lucky to have that.	Oboolyawo nnali wa mukisa okufuna ekyo.
I wonder if he knows it.	Nze nneebuuza oba akimanyi.
I don’t think that would be a very good idea.	Sirowooza nti ekyo kyandibadde kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
He was ready to go.	Yali mwetegefu okugenda.
I’m so scared.	Nze ntya nnyo.
But he was a happy man.	Naye yali musajja musanyufu.
Looks good to me but apparently not.	Kirabika bulungi gyendi naye kirabika si bwe kiri.
You know, the food.	Omanyi, emmere.
This is my everything.	Kino kye buli kimu kyange.
We can do this.	Kino tusobola okukikola.
This is not the right thing to do.	Kino si kye kituufu okukola.
This is not the case at all.	Kino si bwe kiri n’akatono.
He won't talk tonight.	Ekiro kya leero tajja kwogera.
No one knows anyone.	Tewali amanyi muntu yenna.
I will speak.	Nja kwogera.
We’re just fine.	Tuli bulungi kyokka.
There is no answer.	Tewali kuddamu.
Everything is going to be fine.	Buli kimu kigenda kuba bulungi.
I couldn’t find anything	Nnali sisobola kufuna kintu kyonna
I can’t stay here long	Siyinza kumala bbanga ddene wano
I was so glad he had a friend	Nali musanyufu nnyo nti yalina mukwano gwe
No one is good.	Tewali muntu mulungi.
And that’s what it is.	Era ekyo kye kiri.
I couldn’t see anything	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna
His wife was with him.	Mukyala we yali naye.
I know you are a good person	Nkimanyi nti oli muntu mulungi
But you can help.	Naye oyinza okuyamba.
He was behind me now.	Yali emabega wange kati.
Hours, actually.	Ssaawa, mu butuufu.
I can’t believe he did that	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ekyo yakikola
Which I don’t want.	Kye saagala.
I live alone and am very happy	Mbeera nzekka era ndi musanyufu nnyo
Or someone else.	Oba omuntu omulala.
It’s not a place for us.	Si kifo gye tuli.
He was fast, but also really safe.	Yali wa bwangu, naye era nga ddala talina bulabe.
The other was very interested.	Omulala yali ayagala nnyo.
That, of course, is true.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kituufu.
I was so scared.	Nali ntya nnyo.
I just know it.	Nze mmanyi kyokka.
I know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi.
He won’t stay where he is for long.	Tajja kusigala w’ali ebbanga ddene.
I couldn’t see what he did	Nnali sisobola kulaba kye yakola
If this.	Si oyo.
For a while that was fine.	Okumala akaseera ekyo kyali kirungi.
This was a fact.	Kino kyali kituufu.
This is my opportunity.	Guno gwe mukisa gwange.
I didn’t know what to do here	Wano nnali simanyi kya kukola
This is absolutely true.	Kino kituufu ddala.
Which, of course, it wasn’t.	Nga, ddala, si bwe kyali.
Don't know if you knew that or not.	Tomanyi oba ekyo wali okimanyi oba nedda.
I just want to be in my place	Njagala kubeera mu kifo kyange kyokka
Now, or always.	Kati, oba bulijjo.
I feel so alone	Mpulira nga ndi nzekka nnyo
I was a young child.	Nnali mwana muto.
In this process.	Mu nkola eno.
I'm sure there's no problem.	Nkakasa nti tewali buzibu.
Can you help with this? 	Osobola okuyamba ku nsonga eno?
That doesn’t matter right now.	Ekyo si kikulu mu kiseera kino.
I want to do well at my job	Njagala kukola bulungi ku mulimu gwange
It’s just really good.	Kirungi ddala kyokka.
I wanted to know everything	Nnali njagala okumanya buli kimu
I know exactly where they are from that	Nze mmanyi bulungi gye bali okuva ku ekyo
I know it can happen	Nkimanyi nti kiyinza okubaawo
I won’t have to wait long now	Sijja kulinda bbanga ddene kati
I won’t be home with myself.	Sijja kubeera waka nange kennyini.
No chance of that.	Tewali mukisa gwa ekyo.
And he does so.	Era akola bw’atyo.
I could get a job soon	Nnali nsobola okufuna omulimu mu bbanga ttono
It is what they are.	Kye kye bali.
But there was no one there.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna awo.
He was a good man.	Yali musajja mulungi.
I couldn’t find one	Nnali sisobola kufuna emu
I am his doctor.	Nze musawo we.
That was sudden.	Ekyo kyali kya mangu.
I want to go over the plan	Njagala kugenda ku nteekateeka
He says we are fine.	Agamba nti tuli bulungi.
He knows better, too.	Naye asinga kumanya, naye.
Attitude you need to know.	Endowooza olina okumanya.
This is happening every day.	Kino kigenda mu maaso buli lunaku.
I expected something like this	Nali nsuubira ekintu nga kino
I was alone in the house	Nnali nzekka mu nnyumba
I'm really fine	Ddala ndi bulungi
However, they were really good friends.	Kyokka, baali ba mukwano ddala.
I was hoping to talk to you	Nali nsuubira okwogera naawe
And you will believe that what he wants is right.	Era ojja kukkiriza nti ky’ayagala kituufu.
He was a very nice person.	Yali muntu mulungi nnyo.
I hoped this would never happen again	Nali nsuubira nti kino tekijja kuddamu kubaawo
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
I could do it too	Nange nnali nsobola okukikola
And he was .	Era yali .
I didn’t know if that was good or not	Nnali simanyi oba ekyo kyali kirungi oba nedda
For anything.	Ku kintu kyonna.
The food was good.	Emmere yali nnungi.
You can’t have everything.	Tosobola kuba na buli kimu.
It was always him.	Bulijjo yali ye.
I wonder what’s going on	Nze nneebuuza kiki ekigenda mu maaso
This is now.	Kino kiri kati.
I guess you do.	Ntebereza nti ggwe okola.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I love being with him	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye
I want to see something	Njagala kulaba kintu
But, he is more than just a teacher.	Naye, asinga ku musomesa yekka.
I couldn’t believe my luck	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza mukisa gwange
We are what we are.	Ffe kye tuli.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
But I don’t know what I should do.	Naye simanyi kye nsaanidde kukola.
I want to come home to you	Njagala kudda waka gy’oli
You know that very well.	Ekyo okimanyi bulungi nnyo.
He doesn’t go to school.	Tagenda ku ssomero.
He is a good player.	Muzannyi mulungi.
I needed to think, but there was no time	Nnali nneetaaga okulowooza, naye nga tewali budde
I know this is not the place for me	Nkimanyi nti kino si kye kifo gyendi
Now we are.	Kati tuli.
Perhaps his brother did too.	Oboolyawo ne muganda we naye yakikola.
If someone knows.	Singa omuntu amanyi.
He didn't want to answer.	Yali tayagala kuddamu.
However, he is not.	Kyokka si bw’atyo.
I don’t have the money.	Nze sirina ssente.
I have an opinion.	Nnina endowooza.
And every morning.	Era buli ku makya.
There is nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna.
But that’s how it was.	Naye bwe kyali bwe kyali.
I want to go home, she thought	Njagala kudda waka, bwe yalowooza
It will be very, very good.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo nnyo.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
I might get lucky tonight	Nnyinza okufuna omukisa ekiro kino
I should not he	Nze nsaanidde si ye
But he can’t do it.	Naye tasobola kukikola.
He had a plan and everyone knew it.	Yalina enteekateeka era buli omu yali akimanyi.
However, every position is important.	Kyokka buli kifo kikulu.
I was just doing it.	Nze nnali nkola kyokka.
I have no idea what kind of situation	Sirina kye mmanyi ku mbeera ya ngeri ki
I know he thought he was doing well.	Nkimanyi nti yalowooza nti yali akola bulungi.
It’s really nice.	Ddala kirungi.
I need to talk to you about him	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe ku ye
He had already said so much.	Yali yayogera dda bingi nnyo.
But not really.	Naye nedda ddala.
He was right behind me.	Yali emabega wange ddala.
And here we were.	Era wano we twali.
And in a sense it is.	Era mu ngeri emu bwe kiri.
I love my job, actually	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwange, mu butuufu
They were both great.	Bombi baali nnyo.
I have to get to the point.	Nnina okutuuka ku nsonga.
I really don’t want to be that.	Mazima ddala saagala kubeera ekyo.
I couldn’t really see what it was	Nnali sisobola kulaba ddala kiki kye kyali
He could do that.	Ekyo yali asobola okukikola.
There is that.	Waliwo ekyo.
I wonder what he saw	Nneebuuza kye yalaba
One can just do it.	Omuntu asobola okumala okukikola.
He...	Ye...
Of course, this is not entirely the case.	Kya lwatu nti kino si bwe kiri ddala.
I wonder what he did there	Nze nneebuuza kye yakola eyo
Anything can happen baby.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo mwana.
I didn’t really care	Nnali sifaayo nnyo
I hope that’s where I am	Nsuubira nti awo we ndi
I knew he would like it	Namanya nti yandiyagadde
He said he looked better.	Yagambye nti alabika asinga.
I love being with you	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe
I'll admit it now	Nja kukkiriza kati
I can’t live without it	Siyinza kubeerawo nga sirina
I don’t know how this comes about.	Kino simanyi ngeri ki gye kijja.
You’re going to be fine.	Ogenda kuba bulungi.
This is not a good place to be.	Kino si kifo kirungi okubeera.
I wanted to play right now	Nnali njagala kuzannya mu kiseera kino
I was sure now	Nali nkakasa kati
I wish I could be like him in everything	Njagala nnyo okubeera nga ye mu buli kimu
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
I want the reason.	Njagala ensonga.
I just want to do everything	Njagala kukola buli kimu kyokka
You have to get out of here.	Olina okuva wano.
He wanted something from me.	Yali ayagala ekintu okuva gyendi.
That person isn’t going to be me.	Omuntu oyo tagenda kubeera nze.
Nothing was more important than my job.	Tewali kyali kikulu okusinga omulimu gwange.
We can help.	Tusobola okuyamba.
He hoped we were okay.	Yalina essuubi nti tuli bulungi.
I have to do the same	Nze nnina okukola kye kimu
You’ve been working hard, you know.	Obadde okola nnyo, omanyi.
However, that is where we are.	Kyokka awo we tuli.
I can’t believe he’s doing this	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kino akikola
I’ve been here a lot.	Nze mbadde wano nnyo.
I am happy to be home.	Ndi musanyufu okudda awaka.
His brother too.	Muganda we naye.
I do a lot more of that now.	Nze nkola bingi nnyo ku ebyo kati.
He loved what he saw.	Yali ayagala nnyo bye yalaba.
You can, too.	Naawe oyinza.
I don’t care about the location right now.	Sifaayo ku kifo mu kiseera kino.
And he is my best friend.	Era ye mukwano gwange asinga.
I couldn’t find anything.	Nnali sisobola kufuna kintu kyonna.
I wasn’t ready for a relationship	Nze nali siri mwetegefu ku mukwano
I don’t have any children	Sirina mwana yenna
You will love this.	Kino ojja kwagala nnyo.
I will not speak again	Sijja kuddamu kwogera
That was probably a good thing.	Ekyo osanga kyali kintu kirungi.
We were very comfortable.	Twali bulungi nnyo.
I needed time to think	Nnali nneetaaga obudde okulowooza
I hope you can as well	Nsuubira nti osobola nga bwe kiri
I have a home.	Nnina awaka.
I can’t say much about my father	Siyinza kwogera bingi ku taata
I can see how that might work	Nsobola okulaba engeri ekyo gye kiyinza okukikola
Not that, he said.	Si ekyo, bwe yagambye.
I know she will agree	Nkimanyi nti ajja kukkiriza
I couldn’t even process what he said	Nnali sisobola na kukola ku bye yayogera
We will do it.	Tujja kukikola.
There are things that only we can do.	Waliwo ebintu ffe ffekka bye tusobola okukola.
He might, he said.	Ayinza, bwe yagamba.
I didn’t know what to do about it	Nnali simanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo
But he loves it.	Naye ayagala nnyo.
I couldn’t wait until morning.	Nnali sisobola kulinda okutuusa ku makya.
I'm not sure it matters.	Sikakasa nti kikulu.
And one father.	Ne taata omu.
I just didn’t know what to do	Nze nnali simanyi kya kukola
I hope this is okay with you	Nsuubira nti kino kiri bulungi gyoli
I just know it’s true	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti kituufu
I will never do it again	Sijja kuddamu kukikola
He just wanted to go.	Yali ayagala kugenda kyokka.
And there’s certainly nothing wrong with that.	Era mazima ddala tewali kibi kyonna mu ekyo.
I couldn’t see anything	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna
It’s going to work fine.	Kigenda kukola bulungi.
I don’t even care about it.	Sifaayo wadde okukikola.
I know that he knows.	Nkimanyi nti amanyi.
I'm sure that will work	Nkakasa nti ekyo kijja kukola
She loved dogs.	Yali ayagala nnyo embwa.
He had a reason.	Yalina ensonga.
I didn’t really know what he was doing	Nze nali simanyi bulungi kye yali akola
It’s certainly not dangerous.	Mazima ddala si kya bulabe.
He was sick.	Yali mulwadde.
You’re doing a good job.	Okola omulimu omulungi.
It’s not my time to go.	Si kye kiseera kyange okugenda.
I knew it was dangerous	Namanya nti kyali kya bulabe
It’s good for everyone.	Kye kirungi eri buli muntu.
I have my own movie too.	Nnina firimu yange nange.
I always have someone with me.	Bulijjo nnina omuntu nange.
He has already spoken.	Yayogera dda.
You could end up in jail.	Oyinza okutuuka mu kkomera.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
This was a terrible thing.	Kino kyali kibi nnyo.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
We have to think.	Tulina okulowooza.
It really is a beautiful place.	Ddala kifo kirungi nnyo.
Until the end of the movie.	Okutuusa nga firimu ewedde.
I have my own phone	Nnina essimu yange
I want to be as strong as him	Njagala kubeera wa maanyi nga ye
But he can	Naye asobola .
Everything was simple, plain and ordinary.	Buli kimu kyali kyangu, kya lwatu era nga kya bulijjo.
Very easy, too.	Kyangu nnyo, era.
Now I probably need to do it.	Kati osanga nneetaaga okukikola.
But this is my job.	Naye guno gwe mulimu gwange.
I know you don’t want to.	Nkimanyi nti toyagala.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
He knows we were in the right.	Akimanyi nti twali mu kituufu.
He was an only child	Yali mwana yekka
I am to go to them.	Nze ndi wa kugenda gye bali.
I may know what that is	Nnyinza okuba nga mmanyi ekyo kye kiri
I knew we had no choice	Nnali nkimanyi nti tetulina kya kukola
It was really easy actually	Ddala kyali kyangu mu butuufu
I wanted to stay where he was	Nnali njagala kusigala we yali
I didn’t know the time	Nnali simanyi budde
I need to know these things	Nnina okumanya ebintu bino
However, it seems very important.	Kyokka, kirabika kikulu nnyo.
He knew he would, if it was her.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kukikola, singa yali ye.
I doubt that it is.	Nbuusabuusa nti bwe kiri.
Then he thought about it carefully.	Awo n’alowooza bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
I knew that now.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi kati.
He wanted to know she was safe.	Yali ayagala okumanya nti talina bulabe.
He will go, but she will not stay.	Ajja kugenda, naye ye tajja kusigala.
I know that’s not true	Nkimanyi nti ekyo si kituufu
But you have to move on.	Naye olina okugenda mu maaso.
I needed to be with him	Nnali nneetaaga okubeera naye
He is better than us.	Asinga ffe.
I have to read the whole thing	Nnina okusoma ekintu kyonna
It's dangerous there.	Kya bulabe eyo.
The plan worked.	Enteekateeka yakola.
It was.	Kyali.
I wanted to do as he asked	Nnali njagala okukola nga bwe yasaba
I didn’t know it was coming.	Nnali simanyi nti ejja.
I always have something going on	Bulijjo nnina ekintu ekigenda mu maaso
We can both go.	Ffembi tusobola okugenda.
But it wasn’t	Naye si bwe kyali
To you or anyone.	Eri ggwe oba omuntu yenna.
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
I want to work with him	Njagala kukola naye
On his part.	Ku ludda lwe.
I have no such problem	Sirina kizibu ng’ekyo
He has been right.	Abadde mu butuufu.
That would be the right thing to do.	Ekyo kyandibadde kituufu okukola.
Or anyone else.	Oba omuntu omulala yenna.
He looked a little better.	Yalabika bulungi katono.
I think that’s only going to continue	Ndowooza ekyo kigenda kugenda mu maaso kyokka
You have to work hard at it.	Olina okukikola ennyo.
The point is that it’s really not good.	Ensonga eri nti ddala si kirungi.
I was as scared as he was	Nali ntya nga ye
I said it wasn’t bad	Nagamba nti si kibi
I’ve got that watch	Nfunye essaawa eyo
If only he got one.	Singa yafuna emu.
It will be nice to just be us.	Kijja kuba kirungi okubeera ffe ffekka.
I'll try anyway.	Nja kugezaako mu ngeri yonna.
Either way, this is a real problem.	Mu ngeri yonna, kino kizibu kya ddala.
I was very aware of that	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi nnyo
I guess he desperately needs money	Ntebereza nti yeetaaga nnyo ssente
I have to live in the moment	Nnina okubeera mu kiseera kino
We need time.	Twetaaga obudde.
I know a guy who knows a guy	Nze mmanyi ggaayi amanyi ggaayi
That was a talking point.	Ekyo kyali kya kwogera.
It's not you.	Si ggwe.
It will probably help.	Oboolyawo kijja kuyamba.
We will do one at a time.	Tujja kukola kimu ku kimu.
He says he doesn’t need to drive.	Agamba nti teyeetaaga kuvuga.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
My brother is in the hospital.	Muganda wange ali mu ddwaaliro.
Yeah, no.	Ye nedda.
You don’t have to be the best.	Tolina kuba asinga.
I won’t try this week	Sijja kugezaako wiiki eno
That issue is now.	Ensonga eyo eri kati.
Now, we will do it.	Kati, tujja kukikola.
Someone is doing this.	Waliwo akola kino.
He didn't know what to expect.	Yali tamanyi kye yali asuubira.
As soon as we can.	Amangu ddala nga bwe tusobola.
I really can’t do it.	Mazima ddala sisobola kukikola.
I don’t care about his issues	Nze sifaayo ku nsonga ze
It’s great for me to have this opportunity.	Kirungi nnyo gyendi okufuna omukisa guno.
I don’t have time.	Sirina budde.
The famine began.	Enjala yatandika.
You’ve been thinking about me too.	Naawe obadde olowooza ku nze.
I didn’t know what to expect	Nnali simanyi kye nnali nsuubira
You are not in any place.	Toli mu kifo kyonna.
But he was alone.	Naye yali yekka.
No one knew what to do with it.	Tewali yali amanyi kya kukikola.
He'll want to get home now.	Ajja kwagala okutuuka awaka kati.
There's a guy talking to her.	Waliwo ggaayi ayogera naye.
I thought it was great	Nalowooza nti kirungi nnyo
What was he trying to do.	Kiki kye yali agezaako okukola.
He is still very young.	Akyali muto nnyo.
This is what we need.	Kino kye twetaaga.
I will always be around	Nja kuba kumpi bulijjo
I knew we could do it	Nnali nkimanyi nti tusobola okukikola
Nobody wants to talk to me.	Tewali ayagala kwogera nange.
He just wants to be with me.	Ayagala kubeera nange kyokka.
Someone can help.	Waliwo omuntu asobola okuyamba.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I know exactly what you want	Nze mmanyi bulungi ky’oyagala
He is not on any kind of work.	Tali ku mulimu gwa ngeri yonna.
Not exactly there.	Si ddala awo.
I want it here tomorrow	Njagala wano enkya
Until I get my chance.	Okutuusa nga nfunye omukisa gwange.
This was it, he felt.	Kino kye kyali, bwe yawulira.
I’m going to do this whether you like it or not.	Kino ngenda kukikola oba oyagala oba toyagala.
I am ready right now	Ndi mwetegefu mu kiseera kino
I am so alone and so scared.	Nze ndi nzekka nnyo era ntya nnyo.
I want to know what they are doing	Njagala kumanya kye bali mu kukola
But not everyone was happy.	Naye si buli muntu nti yali musanyufu.
But I knew it.	Kyokka nnali nkimanyi.
He didn't know what to do.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola.
I knew it wouldn’t be good though	Namanya nti tekijja kuba kirungi wadde
And that’s not like me.	Era ekyo si nga nze.
I know it’s in mine too	Nkimanyi nti nange kiri mu kyange
I know that you know.	Nkimanyi nti omanyi.
In excellent condition.	Mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
I was very busy actually	Nali bbize nnyo mu butuufu
I don’t think it’s much harder than that.	Sirowooza nti kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I really wanted to leave home	Nnali njagala nnyo okuva awaka
No one wanted to do it.	Tewali yali ayagala kukikola.
I’ve been here before.	Nze mbadde wano emabegako.
It looks pretty good to me.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo gyendi.
You are one of us.	Ggwe oli omu ku ffe.
I have to do this.	Kino nnina okukikola.
. . . .	.
He had no father.	Yali talina taata.
But, we shall see.	Naye, tujja kulaba.
It’s easy that way.	Kyangu mu ngeri eyo.
Everyone wants?.	Buli muntu ayagala?.
I have been wanting to do this	Kino mbadde njagala okukola
I wanted to move on.	Nnali njagala okugenda mu maaso.
we.	ffe.
He has already prayed a lot.	Yasaba dda nnyo.
That's the one there.	Oyo ye eyo eyo.
I just didn’t think it was real	Nze nnali sirowooza nti kyali kya ddala
And for.	Era lwa...
I thought you might come back	Nalowooza nti oyinza okudda
I know you know it’s true.	Nkimanyi nti okimanyi nti kituufu.
One indeed.	Omu ddala.
I could hardly believe it	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza nnyo
However, we have hope.	Kyokka, tulina essuubi.
You won’t do anything wrong.	Tojja kukola kibi kyonna.
I really needed that.	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga nnyo.
I know you will be good to me	Nkimanyi nti ojja kuba mulungi gyendi
He did something to except everyone.	Yakola ekintu okuggyako buli muntu.
I love working with you too	Nange njagala nnyo okukola naawe
But he is not like us.	Naye ye tali nga ffe.
I thought you were my brother.	Nalowooza nti oli muganda wange.
No such opportunity today.	Tewali mukisa nga guno leero.
I feel like I’m sick.	Mpulira nga ndi mulwadde.
I don’t want to be dealing with any of this	Saagala kubeera nga nkola ku kintu kyonna ku bino
I wanted to do it here	Nnali njagala kukikola wano
Everyone can do that right now.	Ekyo buli muntu asobola okukikola mu kiseera kino.
It seems that.	Kirabika nga.
Everyone is friendly to us.	Buli muntu wa mukwano gye tuli.
I was expecting a call and when	Nali nsuubira essimu era ddi
I just hope it helps	Nsuubira kyokka nti kijja kuyamba
This had to be an issue.	Kino kyalina okubaawo ensonga.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
I think the guy has been here before	Ndowooza ggaayi abadde wano emabegako
Apparently she can’t do it and needs help.	Kirabika tasobola kukikola era nga yeetaaga obuyambi.
It’s my father’s job.	Omulimu gwa taata.
I was doing nothing but buying time	Nali sirina kye nkola okuggyako okugula obudde
You think that’s what it is.	Olowooza ekyo kye kiri.
Probably no reason why.	Oboolyawo tewali nsonga lwaki.
I didn’t want to go	Nnali saagala kugenda
He got in trouble.	Yafuna obuzibu.
I have nothing to live for	Sirina kye nnyinza kubeerawo
Now we have a destination.	Kati tulina we tugenda.
I'll come tomorrow	Nja kujja enkya
That’s pretty easy.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo.
We are in trouble.	Tuli mu buzibu.
I wanted to be him.	Nnali njagala kubeera ye.
You are so beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo.
Nothing bad will happen.	Tewali kibi kijja kubaawo.
I could see nothing of the man	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna ku musajja oyo
It’s a serious issue for me.	Ensonga ya maanyi gyendi.
I don’t want to go with him	Saagala kugenda naye
I am so sorry for a lot of things	Nsonyiwa nnyo ebintu bingi
I think that’s very important	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo
He was a really good friend.	Yali mukwano gwange mulungi ddala.
I hope someone here can help.	Nsuubira waliwo wano asobola okuyamba.
He didn’t want to do this.	Kino yali tayagala kukikola.
I could have been me.	Nnali nsobola okuba nze.
I will never be well again.	Sijja kuddamu kuba bulungi.
Not much just a bit.	Si bingi katono ddala.
Maybe he had more money than anyone knew.	Mpozzi yalina ssente nnyingi okusinga omuntu yenna bwe yali amanyi.
I think your plan will work	Ndowooza enteekateeka yo ejja kukola
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
He knew it would come.	Yali akimanyi nti kijja kujja.
I need to get a job	Nze nneetaaga okufuna omulimu
I can never do it right.	Siyinza n’akatono kukikola bulungi.
My image of myself.	Ekifaananyi kyange ku nze.
However, I can’t do it	Kyokka sisobola kukikola
However, I need to move on	Kyokka nneetaaga okugenda mu maaso
And of course.	Era ddala.
We are truly lucky.	Ddala tuli ba mukisa.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
You’re the best.	Ggwe asinga.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
I knew he would never do something like that again	Namanya nti tajja kuddamu kukola kintu ng’ekyo
I thought we could just move on	Nalowooza nti tusobola okumala okugenda mu maaso
In this case, that was a good thing.	Mu mbeera eno, ekyo kyali kintu kirungi.
That’s as usual.	Ekyo nga bulijjo.
This can be anything you want.	Kino kiyinza okuba kyonna ky’oyagala.
And it’s not true.	Era si kituufu.
But he did it.	Naye ye yakikola.
I would love to help	Njagala nnyo okuyamba
There is nothing here.	Wano tewali.
I'm not sure how.	Sikakasa ngeri ki.
I don’t feel anything.	Nze sirina kye mpulira.
I suddenly feel sick.	Mpulira nga ndi mulwadde mu bwangu.
But this is real.	Naye kino kya ddala.
I can’t seem to do that	Ekyo kirabika sisobola kukikola
But that’s not that father.	Naye ekyo si taata eyo.
That’s not the case with this film.	Ekyo si bwe kiri ku firimu eno.
To me it was.	Eri nze bwe kyali.
There is no one.	Tewali muntu yenna.
He was a curious man.	Yali musajja ayagala nnyo okumanya.
Obviously that won’t happen, but that’s the reality.	Kya lwatu ekyo tekijja kubaawo, naye ekyo kye kituufu.
But he knew he was coming.	Kyokka yali akimanyi nti ajja.
This was a little dangerous.	Kino kyali kya bulabe katono.
That thing actually.	Ekintu ekyo mu butuufu.
He is sick and no one wants to be around him.	Mulwadde era tewali ayagala kubeera kumpi naye.
And the guy.	Ne ggaayi.
I have no idea	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna
Anyone who has.	Omuntu yenna alina...
I had nothing to say	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo
I hear you.	Mpulira.
I was sure he would agree	Nali nkakasa nti ajja kukkiriza
The plan was to go home tonight.	Enteekateeka yali ya kudda waka ekiro kino.
It will work as usual.	Kijja kukola nga bulijjo.
I thought about his work.	Nnalowooza ku mulimu gwe.
Apparently this is normal.	Kirabika kino kya bulijjo.
Maybe it can happen again.	Mpozzi kiyinza okuddamu okubaawo.
But they are not.	Naye si bwe bali.
And it wasn’t what he wanted either.	Era naye si kye yali ayagala.
I think everyone knows that now	Ndowooza ekyo buli omu akimanyi kati
And to think positively.	Era okulowooza obulungi.
He knows that, now.	Ekyo akimanyi, kati.
I wonder about my watch	Nneebuuza ku ssaawa yange
No, there isn’t that.	Nedda, tewali ekyo.
It was really sudden.	Kyali kya mangu ddala.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
I really couldn’t tell what was going on	Mu butuufu nnali sisobola kumanya kyali kigenda mu maaso
You never know who might be there.	Tomanyi ani ayinza kubeerawo.
But maybe there’s a backlash now.	Naye mpozzi waliwo okudda emabega kati.
You know that you are.	Omanyi nti oli.
So far everything is fine.	N’okutuusa kati buli kimu kirungi.
I need to make a phone call	Nze nneetaaga okukuba essimu
I think for a while	Ndowooza okumala akaseera
What he is not.	Kye ye si.
I thought he was my best friend	Nnalowooza nti ye mukwano gwange ennyo
I might have a problem with that	Ekyo nnyinza okufuna obuzibu
I’m with you so far.	Nze ndi naawe okutuuka wano.
But it’s going on.	Naye kigenda mu maaso.
I really do, you know	Nze ddala nkola, omanyi
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
but you seem to be fine about it.	naye kirabika oli bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
That’s what he wanted.	Ekyo yali ayagala.
He is not here now.	Tali wano kati.
It’s going to be difficult.	Kigenda kuba kizibu.
I want to be in a relationship with you	Njagala kubeera mu mukwano naawe
Good for them, today.	Kirungi gye bali, leero.
I thought about what it would be like to live with him	Nalowooza ku ngeri gye kyandibadde okubeera naye
I knew this house.	Ennyumba eno nnali mmanyi.
I am not sure if this is true.	Sikakasa oba kino kituufu.
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okukikola.
It is true that	Kituufu nti .
It’s awful, really.	Kibi nnyo, ddala.
He will be very happy.	Ajja kuba musanyufu nnyo.
I still can’t believe it myself	Nze kennyini n’okutuusa kati sisobola kukkiriza
Everyone wants to do that.	Buli muntu ayagala okukola ekyo.
Something like that.	Ekintu nga ekyo.
I know this is important to you	Nkimanyi nti kino kikulu gy’oli
I was well aware of that	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi bulungi
I'm not so sure now.	Sikakasa nnyo kati.
She had to be his friend.	Yalina okuba mukwano gwe.
That’s easy to say.	Ekyo kyangu okwogera.
I am happy and I love it	Ndi musanyufu era njagala nnyo
That will suffice for now.	Ekyo kijja kumala kati.
As it always goes.	Nga bulijjo bwe kigenda.
Just like everyone else in this town.	Nga buli muntu omulala mu kibuga kino.
Not really, anyway.	Si ddala, mu ngeri yonna.
I thought it was good	Nalowooza nti kirungi
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola.
I’m not going to do it	Sigenda kukikola
I really needed this job	Omulimu guno nnali nneetaaga nnyo
Maybe everything would be fine.	Mpozzi buli kimu kyandibadde bulungi.
So far, apparently.	N’okutuusa kati, kirabika.
I really, really wanted that one.	Nze ddala, ddala nnali njagala eyo.
I was hoping you’d come back	Nali nsuubira nti ojja kudda
You have to get out of here.	Olina okuva wano.
I was human only a short time ago	Nali muntu akaseera katono ddala emabega
And you are a man.	Era oli musajja.
No one was on.	Tewali yali ku...
It’s not going down.	Si kugenda wansi.
But it’s not me talking.	Naye si nze okwogera.
I don’t really care.	Sifaayo nnyo.
What was that.	Ekyo kyali ki.
He wants to come.	Ayagala kujja.
This feature is very important.	Ekintu kino kikulu nnyo.
I am a normal person.	Nze ndi wa bulijjo.
I'm thinking about it.	Nze ndowooza ku nsonga eyo.
However, we were the only ones.	Kyokka, twali ffe ffekka.
Something going on here.	Ekintu ekigenda mu maaso wano.
I knew what he was doing well	Nnali mmanyi kye yali akola bulungi
I'm pretty sure you'll be able to go without though.	Nkakasa bulungi nti ojja kusobola okugenda nga tolina wadde.
I thought you were my friend.	Nalowooza nti oli mukwano gwange.
Getting out of the car.	Okuva mu mmotoka.
I can’t say one negative thing about it.	Siyinza kwogera kintu kimu kibi ku nsonga eyo.
I still don’t know how.	Nze n’okutuusa kati simanyi ngeri ki.
There, or there, or there.	Eyo, oba eyo, oba eyo.
Here in this room.	Wano mu kisenge kino.
From within you.	Okuva mu ggwe.
For an hour.	Okumala essaawa emu.
I’m not going to believe it	Sigenda kukkiriza
But not for much.	Naye si lwa bingi.
I couldn’t talk to anyone	Nnali sisobola kwogera na muntu yenna
He started talking to me.	Yatandika okwogera nange.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
What a wonderful man he is.	Nga musajja mulungi nnyo.
Or where this is.	Oba kino we kiri.
I was an only child too	Nange nnali mwana omu yekka
All about himself.	Byonna ku ye kennyini.
Now I can do nothing about it	Kati sirina kye nsobola kukikola
He wants both of us in his office.	Ayagala ffembi mu ofiisi ye.
I think it may well be	Ndowooza kiyinza bulungi okuba nga bwe kiri
I hope to do this below.	Kino nsuubira okukikola wansi.
But in many ways it is not.	Naye mu ngeri nnyingi si bwe kiri.
Of many, one.	Ku bingi, omu.
You can do the same thing.	Naawe osobola okukola ekintu kye kimu.
I wasn’t sure he knew	Nali sikakasa nti yali amanyi
We have so many things.	Tulina ebintu bingi nnyo.
Now, this is something like that.	Kati, kino kintu nga ekyo.
I felt vulnerable	Nnali mpulira nga ndi wa bulabe
I already knew he wouldn’t be any help	Namanya dda nti tajja kuba buyambi bwonna
It was very important to us.	Kyali kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
I knew it was a problem.	Namanya nti buzibu.
I thought you would be moving on now	Nalowooza nti kati ojja kuba ogenda mu maaso
This was a terrible place to be.	Kino kyali kifo kibi nnyo okubeera.
But a good person.	Naye omuntu omulungi.
But he knew it would be enough.	Naye yali akimanyi nti kijja kumala.
In what way did he do so.	Mu ngeri ki gye yakola bw’atyo.
I think we should talk	Ndowooza tusaanidde okwogera
I am certainly not alone.	Mazima ddala siri nzekka.
I’m not going to do that.	Ekyo sigenda kukikola.
He said that was true.	Yagambye nti ekyo kituufu.
I wish there was nothing wrong.	Nze njagala tewali kibi kyonna.
I wanted to see the house	Nnali njagala kulaba nnyumba eyo
But he is not happy.	Naye si musanyufu.
He is in my class.	Ali mu kibiina kyange.
I didn’t know what to do, either.	Nange nnali simanyi kya kukola, era.
He knew who we were.	Yali amanyi kye tuli.
This was good to know.	Kino kyali kirungi okumanya.
It was his car.	Yali mmotoka ye.
I could have done it.	Nnali nsobola okukola.
But we have a problem.	Naye tulina ekizibu.
I’m not interested in being anyone’s girlfriend.	Nze sifaayo kubeera muganzi wa muntu yenna.
He said it looked good.	Yagambye nti kirabika bulungi.
It is very common.	Kya bulijjo nnyo.
As it goes on.	Nga bwe kigenda mu maaso.
You have to be there.	Olina okuba awo.
I didn’t know you had so much in you.	Nali simanyi nti olina bingi nnyo mu ggwe.
He is in abundance.	Ali mu bungi.
And so far, it is.	Era okutuuka wano, bwe kiri.
You didn’t know.	Ggwe wali tomanyi.
I want anything, you know? 	Njagala ekintu kyonna, omanyi?
I really think a lot about him	Ddala ndowooza nnyo ku ye
I just know he’s vulnerable	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti alina obuzibu
This seems to be true.	Kino kirabika nga kituufu.
I didn’t know where or from what	Nnali simanyi wa oba okuva kiki
I like to do things by myself	Njagala nnyo okukola ebintu nzekka
I think he’s doing pretty well	Ndowooza akola bulungi nnyo
But it is so much more than that.	Naye bingi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
It’s not a group.	Si kibiina.
That, of course, was pretty bad.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kyali kibi nnyo.
He wanted to go home more than anything right now.	Yali ayagala okudda eka okusinga ekintu kyonna mu kiseera kino.
I have to be on him	Nnina okubeera ku ye
Front and rear.	Mu maaso ne emabega.
I couldn’t keep going for very long	Nnali sisobola kusigala nga ngenda mu maaso okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo
I think he knows that.	Ndowooza ekyo akimanyi.
He had obviously had enough.	Kya lwatu yali amaze okumala.
I knew you wouldn’t go away	Nali mmanyi nti togenda kugenda
I'll come with you	Nja kujja naawe
I don’t think there is.	Sirowooza nti waliwo.
He was the only one you wanted.	Ye yekka gwe wali oyagala.
Maybe it was like he was.	Mpozzi nga bwe yali.
This may be exactly the case.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri ddala.
You can do the same thing.	Naawe oyinza okukola ekintu kye kimu.
If he does anything.	Singa akola ekintu kyonna.
All right, you can go.	Kirungi, osobola okugenda.
He was happy to be home.	Yali musanyufu okuba awaka.
But we are in a hurry.	Naye tuli mu bwangu.
I just don’t like it.	Sikyagala kyokka.
Or a problem.	Oba ekizibu.
But he was a human being.	Naye yali muntu.
But here’s the problem.	Naye wano waliwo obuzibu.
I wanted to talk to you	Nnali njagala okwogera naawe
You do just fine without me.	Okola bulungi nnyo nga sirina.
I will continue to work with him.	Nja kusigala nga nkola naye.
I really don’t know	Mazima ddala simanyi
I know what they are now.	Nze mmanyi kye bali kati.
But not now.	Naye si kati.
I wanted to win.	Nnali njagala kuwangula.
But here’s where the problem lies.	Naye wano we wali obuzibu.
I think about going home	Ndowooza ku kudda eka
I couldn’t see anything	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna
No man could.	Tewali musajja yali asobola.
However, it would be worse.	Kyokka, kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
But I, no.	Naye nze, nedda.
Glad to know soon.	Musanyufu okumanya amangu ddala.
He came with everything.	Yajja na buli kimu.
Everyone does this in their own time.	Kino buli muntu akikola mu kiseera kye.
He didn't know what to say.	Yali tamanyi kya kwogera.
He didn’t want to be lucky.	Yali tayagala kuba wa mukisa.
I like to work hard.	Njagala nnyo okukola ennyo.
He knew it.	Yali amanyi.
I think it was just beautiful	Ndowooza nti kyali kirungi kyokka
And we had it.	Era twali tulina.
I had no idea about that	Ekyo nnali sirina kye mmanyi
I can never let that happen again	Ekyo siyinza kuddamu kukkiriza kubaawo
To be myself.	Okubeera nze kennyini.
I couldn’t believe it myself	Nze kennyini nnali sisobola kukkiriza
No, this was fine.	Nedda, kino kyali kirungi.
I hope it will be long-term	Nsuubira nti kijja kuba kya bbanga ddene
I thought it would help my career	Nalowooza nti kijja kuyamba omulimu gwange
I’ve been fine	Mbadde bulungi
I didn’t know what to do	Nnali simanyi kya kukola
You are making great progress.	Ogenda mu maaso nnyo.
We can leave the city.	Tusobola okuva mu kibuga.
I can’t even stay home	Sisobola na kusigala waka
At the wedding.	Ku mbaga.
I was really scared and didn’t know what to do.	Ddala nnali ntya era nga simanyi kya kukola.
And yet it won’t work.	Era naye tekijja kukola.
It will be difficult.	Kijja kuba kizibu.
I think he's asleep now	Ndowooza kati yeebase
That's the only thing.	Ekyo kye kintu kyokka.
It is true that.	Kituufu nti.
I was thinking tomorrow	Nali ndowooza enkya
I thought he did a good job.	Nnalowooza nti yakola omulimu mulungi.
Nothing is going well.	Tewali kigenda bulungi.
Now he came forward.	Kati yajja mu maaso.
She was so beautiful in so many ways.	Yali mulungi nnyo mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo.
This just isn’t the case here.	Kino kyokka si bwe kiri wano.
I didn’t know you could do that	Ekyo nnali simanyi nti osobola okukikola
He knows it won’t happen.	Akimanyi nti tekijja kubaawo.
You should have been.	Ggwe wandibadde.
He does whatever he wants.	Akola kyonna ky’ayagala.
Actually, that’s good.	Mu butuufu, ekyo kirungi.
To both of them, actually.	Eri bombi, mu butuufu.
But there is no help.	Naye tewali buyambi.
I can’t stay almost every day now	Sisobola kusigala kumpi buli lunaku kati
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
I thought immediately	Nalowooza mangu ddala
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
He can’t be here.	Tasobola kubeera wano.
I love you personally	Njagala nnyo ggwe kennyini
It’s difficult.	Kizibu.
It’s not me.	Si nze.
This can backfire very quickly.	Kino kiyinza okudda emabega mu bwangu ddala.
It's right down there.	Kiri wansi ddala awo.
But there’s nothing there.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna awo.
I need to do it.	Nze nneetaaga okukikola.
I am just one person	Ndi muntu omu yekka
I don’t have much time	Sirina budde bungi
I feel better here	Wano mpulira bulungi
He's like me.	Ye nga nze.
That is what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
It was just an idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kyokka.
A really nice guy, though	Ggaayi omulungi ddala, wadde
I’ve been in that position for a while.	Mbadde mu kifo ekyo okumala akaseera.
I'm sure of that much.	Nze nkakasa bingi ebyo.
If only we were lucky.	Singa twali ba mukisa.
I could have my brother	Nnali nsobola okufuna muganda wange
That is not true at all.	Ekyo si kituufu n’akatono.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
I’m not sure it’s true	Sikakasa kituufu
I already knew he wouldn’t	Namanya dda nti tajja kukikola
In fact, he didn’t have to.	Mu butuufu, yali talina kukikola.
I know you want to talk.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala kwogera.
I knew he wouldn’t	Namanya nti tajja kukikola
I didn’t know what it was yet.	Nnali simanyi kiki n’okutuusa kati.
A little bit of me	Katono ku nze
I have a feeling it won’t happen.	Nnina endowooza nti tekijja kubaawo.
Happy, she thought.	Musanyufu, bwe yalowooza.
But it was probably true.	Naye osanga kyali kituufu.
I wondered what he wanted	Nneebuuza kye yali ayagala
But he was here.	Naye yali wano.
He can just do it.	Asobola okukikola kyokka.
It was just what I wanted	Nze kye nnali njagala kyokka
I should do that.	Ekyo nsaanidde okukikola.
You are not alone.	Ggwe si ggwe wekka.
I have a plan and you will be fine	Nnina enteekateeka era ojja kuba bulungi
Everyone has to work.	Buli omu alina okukola.
I'm just glad you were here	Ndi musanyufu kyokka nti wali wano
I have to get out of here	Nnina okuva wano
Someone like you is my friend.	Omuntu nga ggwe mukwano gwange.
But that wasn’t the problem.	Naye ekyo si kye kyali ekizibu.
I think you would like it	Ndowooza wandyagadde
That seems like everything.	Ekyo kirabika nga buli kimu.
I hope everything is okay	Nsuubira nti buli kimu kiri bulungi
For me, that’s pretty cool	Nze ekyo kirungi nnyo
It’s not exactly the same thing.	Si kintu kye kimu ddala.
I wanted to go again, but I couldn't	Nnali njagala okuddamu okugenda naye nga sisobola
Really.	Kituufu.
We can do it a lot.	Tusobola okukikola ennyo.
I wonder why he does that	Nze nneebuuza lwaki akola ekyo
I know it’s not true.	Nkimanyi nti si kituufu.
I actually thought it was okay	Mu butuufu nnalowooza nti si kibi
He was here.	Yali wano.
I feel so alone	Mpulira nga ndi nzekka nnyo
You have to stay in one place for a while now.	Olina okubeera mu kifo kimu okumala akaseera kati.
If only he had the time.	Singa yalina obudde.
You’re in the city.	Oli mu kibuga.
At this point I couldn’t	Mu kiseera kino nnali sisobola
As he did.	Nga bwe yakola.
We need to know exactly where.	Tulina okumanya ddala wa.
He couldn’t do this.	Kino yali tasobola kukikola.
I think you would like it	Ndowooza wandyagadde
What a beautiful child.	Nga mwana mulungi nnyo.
I was actually afraid he wouldn’t	Mu butuufu nnali ntya nti tajja kukikola
I'll move on.	Nja kugenda mu maaso.
I have a phone.	Nnina essimu.
What he was doing at the time was fine.	Kye yali akola mu kiseera ekyo kyali kirungi.
I can’t eat this.	Kino sisobola kulya.
No, of course, it is.	Nedda, ddala, bwe kiri.
I can’t deal with anything	Sisobola kukola ku kintu kyonna
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
For a while.	Okumala akaseera.
I don’t want to do this.	Kino saagala kukikola.
Here is another one.	Wano waliwo omulala.
I know what my father did	Nze mmanyi taata kye yakola
This is definitely not the same.	Kino mazima ddala si kye kimu.
I'll have time to think tomorrow	Nja kufuna obudde okulowooza enkya
Looks good, she thought.	Kirabika bulungi, bwe yalowooza.
Give something.	Wa ekintu.
Not really .	Si ddala .
That's why he did it.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki yakikola.
He couldn’t tell what was going on.	Yali tayinza kumanya kyali kigenda mu maaso.
I know you will	Nkimanyi nti ojja kukikola
He didn’t seem to need to eat.	Yalabika nga teyeetaaga kulya.
I know nothing about the class	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kibiina
I want to know who did this	Njagala kumanya ani yakola kino
I can’t go myself.	Nze kennyini sisobola kugenda.
I guess it really doesn’t matter.	Ntebereza nti ddala si kikulu.
Everyone has to do it.	Buli muntu alina okukikola.
He's actually really pretty.	Mu butuufu ddala mulungi nnyo.
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
I feel so much better now	Mpulira bulungi nnyo kati
He will speak again.	Ajja kuddamu okwogera.
And indeed it was.	Era ddala bwe kyali.
He looked beautiful.	Yalabika nga mulungi.
But it’s not me, it’s the woman.	Naye si nze, ye mukyala.
Obviously it was.	Kya lwatu bwe kyali.
I'm going quickly.	Ngenda mangu.
I think you should be	Ndowooza olina okubeera
Like myself.	Nga nze kennyini.
I have no problem accepting that now	Ekyo sirina buzibu kukkiriza kati
I want to spend time with you	Njagala kumala budde naawe
My dog.	Embwa yange.
A good friend of mine owns it	Mukwano gwange omulungi y’alina
I think it will be good	Ndowooza kijja kuba kirungi
It is absolutely true.	Ddala ddala bwe kiri.
We have money in that.	Tulina ssente mu ekyo.
He had always been like that.	Bulijjo yali abadde bw’atyo.
Obviously I wasn’t in jail	Kya lwatu nnali siri mu kkomera
I should definitely get an hour	Mazima ddala nsaanidde okufuna essaawa
It’s not what it seems.	Si kye kirabika.
I was so in love with it	Nnali njagala nnyo
. . . .	.
I do a lot of swimming	Nkola nnyo okuwuga
That’s good for us.	Ekyo kirungi gye tuli.
Or you can take a picture.	Oba oyinza okukuba ekifaananyi.
I still couldn’t speak	N’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kwogera
He was just so good.	Yali mulungi nnyo kyokka.
Perhaps this was true.	Oboolyawo kino kyali kituufu.
Everyone was very happy.	Buli omu yali musanyufu nnyo.
And the thing is not you.	Era ekintu si ggwe.
I was having trouble thinking clearly, quickly	Nnali nfunye obuzibu okulowooza obulungi, mu bwangu
I was just a human being.	Nali muntu yekka.
This is not what it seems today.	Kino si kye kirabika leero.
Not until you are.	Si okutuusa nga ggwe.
I am happy to do that	Ndi musanyufu okukola ekyo
You are a beautiful woman.	Oli mukyala mulungi.
You rather than me.	Ggwe okusinga nze.
I know nothing but this.	Sirina kye mmanyi okuggyako kino.
But there isn’t.	Naye tewali.
I couldn’t believe that was all	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti ekyo kyokka kye kyali
I live in the now.	Nze mbeera mu kati.
And there are so many more.	Era bingi nnyo.
We are making great progress.	Tugenda mu maaso nnyo.
This is not the truth.	Kino si kye kituufu.
You are, too.	Naawe oli.
He needed to do it.	Yali yeetaaga okukikola.
I didn’t know what to do	Nnali simanyi kya kukola
From now on you and I.	Okuva kati nze naawe.
I can’t wait actually	Siyinza kulinda mu butuufu
I didn’t know what to do.	Nnali simanyi kya kukola.
I thought you might have	Nalowooza nti oyinza okuba nga olina
But he was afraid.	Naye yali atya.
It was just something.	Kyali kintu kyokka.
He loved to talk.	Yali ayagala nnyo okwogera.
I know my job.	Nze mmanyi omulimu gwange.
I am not and cannot be.	Siri era siyinza kubeera.
I expected it to happen.	Nnali nsuubira nti kijja kubaawo.
Working hard.	Okukola ennyo.
I couldn’t go home	Nnali sisobola kudda waka
I was powerless	Nali sirina maanyi
I hoped he was original	Nnali nsuubira nti yali wa dda
He has the money.	Alina ssente.
I want to be happy here with him	Njagala kubeera musanyufu wano naye
Good or bad.	Kirungi oba kibi.
It’s this.	Kye kino.
Me and the guy, and his wife too.	Nze ne ggaayi, ne mukyala we naye.
I expected something like this to happen	Nnali nsuubira ekintu nga kino okubaawo
He has been looking good.	Abadde alabika bulungi.
I had no such idea	Nnali sirina kirowoozo ng’ekyo
It was obviously important to me.	Kya lwatu nti kyali kikulu gyendi.
He had been very busy.	Yali abadde bbize nnyo.
I knew it and he knew it	Nali nkimanyi era naye yali akimanyi
I don’t want to see anyone	Saagala kulaba muntu yenna
I knew nothing about money.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ssente.
I didn’t think that was true	Ekyo nnali sirowooza nti kituufu
We are together.	Tuli wamu.
I love it so much!.	Nze njagala nnyo!.
It was that kind of week.	Yali wiiki ya ngeri eyo.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
I don’t know what that is.	Ekyo simanyi kye ki.
While on the job.	Nga ali ku mulimu.
And in a sense, this is true.	Era mu ngeri emu, kino kituufu.
I think they are.	Ndowooza bwe bali.
I couldn’t tell	Nnali sisobola kumanya
I knew you would come	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kujja
He's a good teacher, you know.	Musomesa mulungi, omanyi.
He wants to be like you.	Ayagala kubeera nga ggwe.
I could read in him something he couldn’t say.	Nnali nsobola okusoma mu ye ekintu kye yali tasobola kwogera.
I don’t think it was his idea.	Sirowooza nti kyali kirowoozo kye.
I thought you wanted to be my friend	Nalowooza nti oyagala kubeera mukwano gwange
I was a schoolteacher	Nnali musomesa wa ssomero
I thought of luck	Nalowooza ku mukisa
I didn’t know what to do, or where to go	Nnali simanyi kya kukola, oba gye nnali ngenda
I don’t know if you would.	Simanyi oba wandibadde okola.
He is always good.	Bulijjo abeera mulungi.
This book is in good condition.	Ekitabo kino kiri mu mbeera nnungi.
It was worse than he had imagined.	Kyali kibi nnyo okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
He knew better than she did.	Yali amanyi bulungi okusinga ye.
I’m not really the best	Nze mu butuufu siri asinga obulungi
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
And it probably will.	Era oboolyawo kijja kubaawo.
And it really isn’t.	Era mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
And you can help.	Era osobola okuyamba.
I guess he was like that	Ntebereza nti bw’atyo bwe yali
I really need to talk to him	Nneetaaga nnyo okwogera naye
I want to play too.	Nange njagala kuzannya.
I can’t let anyone do that, not even you	Siyinza kukkiriza muntu yenna kukola ekyo, wadde ggwe
I’m here almost every day	Nze ndi wano kumpi buli lunaku
He wants to go.	Ayagala kugenda.
I didn’t know who it was	Nnali simanyi ani
I'm not entirely sure why.	Sikakasa ddala lwaki.
I'm glad it's not him and his friends	Ndi musanyufu nti si ba ye ne mikwano gye
You can’t go do a man’s job.	Tosobola kugenda kukola mulimu gwa musajja.
I will not say this again	Kino sijja kuddamu kwogera
I won’t be him.	Sijja kubeera ye.
And it is everywhere.	Era kiri buli wamu.
I need to know what he wants	Nnina okumanya ky’ayagala
Not even at the time.	Si wadde mu kiseera ekyo.
It was right down.	Yali wansi ddala.
One thing is for sure.	Ekintu kimu kiri nti.
He would be asleep soon, too.	Yandibadde yeebase mu bbanga ttono, era naye.
We can do it.	Tusobola okukikola.
I think this is it	Ndowooza kino kye kiri
Everyone knew that.	Ekyo buli omu yali akimanyi.
I think there’s something in us.	Ndowooza waliwo ekintu mu ffe.
I am currently working on this myself.	Mu kiseera kino nze kennyini nkola ku nsonga eno.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
I needed to go see what he needed	Nnali nneetaaga okugenda okulaba kye yali yeetaaga
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
Making money.	Okukola ssente.
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kintu kirungi.
We are just like everyone else.	Tuli nga buli muntu omulala yenna.
I really hope you might as well	Nsuubira ddala nti oyinza nga bwe kiri
He is my son.	Ye mwana wange.
You won’t be comfortable.	Tojja kubeera bulungi.
He was here, and very close.	Yali wano, era kumpi nnyo.
I can’t believe it	Siyinza kukkiriza
I didn’t really want to be here	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kubeera wano
This is his place to be.	Kino kye kifo kye ky’alina okubeera.
I wanted to be ready	Nnali njagala kubeera mwetegefu
Like, you just have it.	Nga, olina kyokka.
I am not home to anyone.	Siri waka eri omuntu yenna.
I couldn’t believe it.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza.
I just didn’t want to believe it	Nze nali saagala kukkiriza kyokka
There are so many reasons.	Waliwo ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
But we have to do it.	Naye tulina okukikola.
I have to do this	Kino nnina okukikola
And you know, that’s fine with me.	Era omanyi, ekyo kirungi gyendi.
But, this is the point.	Naye, eno y’ensonga.
That’s pretty easy to do.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo okukola.
I have a point though.	Nnina ensonga wadde.
I was ready to get back to town	Nnali mwetegefu okudda mu kibuga
And how you were.	Era engeri gye wali.
We couldn’t talk.	Twali tetusobola kwogera.
I already knew where I was going	Nnali mmanyi dda gye nnali ngenda
He did what he wanted.	Yakola kye yali ayagala.
I couldn’t tell what he was thinking	Nnali sisobola kumanya kye yali alowooza
Just talking about anything.	Okwogera ku kintu kyonna kyokka.
I will do this myself.	Kino nja kukikola nze kennyini.
I wonder where he went	Nneebuuza gye yagenda
This week here, that week there.	Wiiki eno wano, wiiki eyo eyo.
And I know, that will be good for me	Era nkimanyi, ekyo kijja kuba kirungi gyendi
This is what we should do.	Kino kye tusaanidde okukola.
I just didn’t know what to say	Nze nnali simanyi kya kwogera kyokka
There really is.	Ddala waliwo.
But other than that, you’re doing fine.	Naye okuggyako ekyo, okola bulungi.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
I want to keep working	Njagala kusigala nga nkola
I am now working.	Nze kati nkola.
I'm glad you're here to see this.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano okulaba kino.
Not you, no, not you.	Si ggwe, nedda, si ggwe.
This would be very important.	Kino kyandibadde kikulu nnyo.
He wanted to talk now.	Yali ayagala kwogera kati.
I wasn’t quite ready	Nnali siri mwetegefu nnyo
He knew what would happen if he told the police no.	Yali amanyi ekigenda okubaawo singa agamba poliisi nti nedda.
He was curious and he didn’t want to know.	Yali ayagala kumanya era nga tayagala kumanya.
We’ll do it tomorrow.	Tujja kukikola enkya.
I have to think of something	Nnina okulowooza ku kintu
I have no idea where they are, or whether, they are.	Sirina kye mmanyi gye bali, oba oba, gye bali.
What a lot of them.	Nga bingi nnyo.
I really think you should go now	Nze ddala ndowooza nti wandibadde ogenda kati
He's always slept like that.	Bulijjo abadde yeebase bw'atyo.
Luck is important.	Omukisa kikulu.
I feel better already	Nze mpulira bulungi dda
The book in the front.	Ekitabo mu maaso.
Within a week.	Mu wiiki emu.
He agreed it was a good idea.	Yakkiriza nti kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
His job is to.	Omulimu gwe.
I wanted to see where.	Nnali njagala kulaba wa.
Everyone was going.	Buli omu yali agenda.
I want to get back to that guy	Njagala kuddamu ku ggaayi oyo
I don’t have much time.	Sirina budde bungi.
Now we have a destination.	Kati tulina we tugenda.
I don’t want to be here	Saagala kubeera wano
But he was very interested.	Naye yali ayagala nnyo.
Everyone wants to be happy.	Buli muntu ayagala kubeera musanyufu.
I didn’t know what he was	Nnali simanyi kye yali
I don’t want to be like him	Saagala kubeera nga ye
I can do it.	Nsobola okukola.
This is probably true.	Kino oboolyawo kituufu.
I need to address this myself	Kino nze kennyini nneetaaga okukola ku nsonga eno
I don’t want this to happen again	Kino saagala kuddamu kubaawo
Would that be an issue?.	Eyo yandibadde nsonga?.
He is being what each of us are here for.	Ye ali kubeera nga buli omu ffe kye tuli wano.
I wanted to hit something	Nnali njagala okukuba ekintu
I think you knew that too.	Ndowooza naawe ekyo wali okimanyi.
I think you’ll come with us	Ndowooza ojja kujja naffe
This is not very good.	Kino si kirungi nnyo.
Your opinion doesn’t matter.	Endowooza yo si nsonga.
No, that’s not the point.	Nedda, eyo si nsonga.
You know what.	Omanyi ki.
It would be very dangerous.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe nnyo.
And not here.	Era si wano.
Otherwise that is this.	Oba si ekyo ekyo kye kino.
I couldn’t say much more.	Nnali sisobola kwogera bingi nnyo.
Where he should be.	We yandibadde.
I could definitely go for that.	Nnali nsobola ddala okugenda ku ekyo.
I think it’s great you have a lot of money.	Ndowooza kirungi nnyo olina ssente nnyingi.
He could preach.	Yali asobola okubuulira.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
But that would be too easy.	Naye ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
I guess we’ll have to see what happens	Ntebereza nti tujja kuba tulina okulaba ekigenda okubaawo
I knew exactly who he was	Nnali mmanyi bulungi ani
Maybe he really went with her.	Mpozzi ddala yagenda naye.
I was glad we were friends now	Nnali musanyufu nti kati twali ba mukwano
We cannot allow this to happen.	Kino tetusobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
I’ll be just fine	Nja kuba bulungi nnyo
But it’s not a good idea.	Naye si kirowoozo kirungi.
Anyone know if that was true.	Omuntu yenna amanyi oba ekyo kyali kituufu.
No, it is not.	Nedda si bwe kiri.
I like this concept in practice.	Njagala nnyo endowooza eno mu nkola.
I had nothing to say.	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera.
I just need to talk to you about something	Nze nneetaaga kwogera naawe ku kintu kyokka
I guess we’re not the only ones	Ntebereza nti si ffe ffekka
No one wants to.	Tewali ayagala.
I was almost sick on the spot.	Nali kumpi mulwadde mu kifo ekyo.
No one did anything.	Tewali yakola kintu kyonna.
To be excellent.	Okubeera omulungi ennyo.
I work hard here and you know that	Nkola nnyo wano era ekyo okimanyi
I feel so, so much.	Mpulira nnyo nnyo.
I just want to be home	Njagala kubeera waka kyokka
It would be awkward if.	Kyandibadde kizibu singa...
Of course, no one was going to get it.	Kya lwatu nti tewali yali agenda kufuna.
I want to stay.	Njagala kusigala.
He was there.	Yali awo.
Good luck in everything.	Omukisa omulungi mu buli kimu.
You will get another chance.	Ojja kufuna omukisa omulala.
It’s a very complicated thing.	Kintu kizibu nnyo.
I feel pretty good, actually	Mpulira bulungi nnyo, mu butuufu
I have to do that.	Ekyo nnina okukikola.
He is such a good man.	Musajja mulungi bwatyo.
You have to do this.	Kino olina okukikola.
He obviously couldn’t.	Kya lwatu nti yali tasobola.
I don’t have a classroom position.	Sirina kifo kya kibiina.
I am, and always here	Nze ndi, era bulijjo wano
He has always been.	Bulijjo abadde.
I was a sick child	Nnali mwana mulwadde
Me, too, of course.	Nange, ddala.
He lives there, all right.	Abeera eyo, bulungi.
This is all a process.	Kino kyonna nkola.
I am not like him.	Nze siri nga ye.
Money I didn’t want.	Ssente ze nnali saagala.
I don’t even want to know how bad it is.	Saagala na kumanya ngeri kibi gye kiri.
No one knows at home.	Tewali amanyi waka.
I guess it was pretty bad	Ntebereza nti kyali kibi nnyo
This is simply not true.	Kino si kituufu kyokka.
I do have a very early morning	Nze ddala nnina enkya ennyo
I have no problem with money.	Sirina buzibu bwonna ku ssente.
But maybe.	Naye mpozzi.
He doesn’t want to talk about the wedding.	Tayagala kwogera ku mbaga.
But we have a little time.	Naye tulina akaseera katono.
However, he still could not tell.	Kyokka ne kati yali tasobola kumanya.
I said no such thing.	Nagamba nti tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
I knew and it didn’t matter	Nali mmanyi era nga si kikulu
I really didn’t want to go	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kugenda
I didn’t know what to say either	Nange nnali simanyi kya kwogera
You know how it is.	Omanyi bwe kiri.
He couldn’t do it alone.	Yali tasobola kukikola yekka.
I can move on now.	Nsobola okugenda mu maaso kati.
I don’t think it will.	Sirowooza nti kijja kukikola.
He said he was, but it’s not true.	Yagambye nti yali, naye si kituufu.
This is not an opinion.	Eno si ndowooza.
At the time, it probably was.	Mu kiseera ekyo, oboolyawo bwe kyali.
That we were the same.	Nti twali kye kimu.
I’m just happy.	Nze ndi musanyufu kyokka.
It’s good for us.	Kirungi gye tuli.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera.
I’ll be fine at home.	Nja kuba bulungi awaka.
I am sure I will win.	Nkakasa nti nja kuwangula.
I know how important it is.	Nkimanyi nti kikulu nnyo.
I couldn’t go to the police	Nnali sisobola kugenda ku poliisi
It had to be good, it had to be.	Yalina okuba obulungi, yalina okuba.
And that’s what this is.	Era ekyo kye kino.
I am so happy to be here now	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano kati
That’s dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe.
And in the evening as well.	Era akawungeezi nga bwe kiri.
He had been good to me.	Yali abadde mulungi gyendi.
I hope he comes back soon	Nsuubira nti ajja kudda mangu
You could do it too, you know.	Naawe oyinza okukikola, omanyi.
I am very strong in my own way	Ndi wa maanyi nnyo mu ngeri yange
I couldn’t say how long	Nnali sisobola kwogera bbanga ki
It seems that since.	Kirabika nti okuva...
And for me, that’s no way to live.	Era nze, eyo si ngeri ya kubeerawo.
I hope he is okay	Nsuubira nti ali bulungi
That was the problem.	Ekyo kye kyali ekintu ekizibu.
I am happy to have him here.	Ndi musanyufu okubeera naye wano.
I want to know everything	Njagala kumanya buli kimu
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Mpozzi katono, mpozzi bingi.
I couldn’t believe it was him	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti ye ye
But not everyone went.	Naye si buli muntu nti yagenda.
I just hoped it would happen soon	Nali nsuubira kyokka nti kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono
I wanted the truth.	Nnali njagala mazima.
This is going to happen.	Kino kigenda mu maaso.
I knew he wasn’t	Nnali nkimanyi nti si bwe yali
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
I loved everyone and everything.	Nnali njagala nnyo buli muntu na buli kimu.
And, of course, this is true.	Era, kya lwatu, kino kituufu.
This is very unusual.	Kino si kya bulijjo nnyo.
He had to get to work.	Yalina okutuuka ku mulimu.
I could absolutely do anything	Nnali nsobola ddala okukola ekintu kyonna
You can't 'be.	Tosobola 'kubeera.
He looks very young.	Alabika muto nnyo.
She looks absolutely beautiful.	Alabika bulungi ddala.
Everyone wanted to help.	Buli omu yali ayagala okuyamba.
You said it would be hard, and it was.	Wagamba nti kijja kuba kizibu, era bwe kyali.
That's all it is.	Ekyo kyonna kye kiri.
The police are there.	Poliisi eri awo.
Now he spoke.	Kati yayogera.
I just know he will	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti ajja kukikola
Anyone else think this is a bad idea?.	Waliwo omulala yenna alowooza nti kino kirowoozo kibi?.
This is very important!.	Kino kikulu nnyo!.
I had no idea such a thing could happen	Nnali sirina kirowoozo nti ekintu ng’ekyo kiyinza okubaawo
I was a lot like you at the time	Nali nnyo nga ggwe mu kiseera ekyo
It was what he wanted to do.	Kyali kye yali ayagala okukola.
He knew why.	Yali amanyi lwaki.
I really don’t want to talk to my father.	Mazima ddala saagala kwogera na taata.
That wasn’t my thing.	Ekyo si kye kyali ekintu kyange.
Maybe even a week.	Mpozzi ne wiiki emu.
It’s my job.	Gwe mulimu gwange.
I am very curious.	Njagala nnyo okumanya.
He can make plans now.	Asobola okukola enteekateeka kati.
That’s what he wanted to do.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala okukola.
I really have to work on this	Kino ddala nnina okukola ku nsonga eno
I think he was doing the same with us	Ndowooza naye yali akola kye kimu naffe
That will be good.	Ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
I was like him.	Nze nnali nga ye.
I will never live there again	Sijja kuddamu kubeera eyo
I know what you mean	Nze mmanyi ky’oyagala okwogera
He said that.	Yagambye nti.
He wanted to do it for the money.	Yali ayagala kukikola lwa ssente.
But he is not good.	Naye si mulungi.
It’s time to act.	Kye kiseera okukola.
It’s much more complicated than that.	Kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He knew how to do that.	Ekyo yali amanyi okukikola.
I can be anything.	Nsobola okuba kyonna.
I am nothing really	Nze siri kintu kyonna ddala
I’m not sure of anything	Sikakasa kintu kyonna
Thinking about something.	Okulowooza ku kintu.
I don't care who did it, that's not the point.	Sifaayo ani yakikola, eyo si y'ensonga.
And this is it!.	Era kino kye kiri!.
I love living there	Njagala nnyo okubeera eyo
I want to know what’s going on	Njagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
Back to the past.	Okudda emabegako.
I feel that would be good	Mpulira nti ekyo kyandibadde kirungi
I love this product.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino.
I’m not sure it’s true.	Sikakasa kituufu.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
I won’t be able to see my place	Sijja kusobola kulaba kifo kyange
Not for long.	Si okumala ebbanga ddene.
He can do whatever he wants to do.	Asobola okukola kyonna ky’ayagala okukola.
Now he knew exactly who he was.	Kati yali amanyi bulungi ani.
I just don’t know.	Nze simanyi kyokka.
He is dangerous.	Wa bulabe.
Everyone was going.	Buli omu yali agenda.
I think you’ll be just fine	Ndowooza ojja kuba bulungi nnyo
I said this would be good	Nagamba nti kino kyandibadde kirungi
I ask the same of you	Nze naawe nsaba kye kimu
Not much just now.	Si bingi kati kyokka.
I love my brother too	Nange njagala nnyo muganda wange
We should just accept this.	Kino tusaanidde kumala kukkiriza.
Not below.	Si wansi.
I wasn’t sure.	Nnali sikakasa.
I have one in my office.	Nnina emu mu ofiisi yange.
I know nothing about this problem.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kizibu kino.
I couldn’t get in time	Nnali sisobola kufuna mu budde
I know what you were doing	Nze kye wali okola nkimanyi
Really, you want this book.	Ddala, oyagala ekitabo kino.
How can I do this.	Kino nnyinza ntya okukikola.
It's my room.	Ye kisenge kyange.
But I am not alone.	Naye siri nzekka.
I knew this was all too good to be true	Namanya nti kino kyonna kyali kirungi nnyo
You’ll be fine.	Ojja kuba bulungi.
I know it’s hard for you	Nkimanyi nti kizibu gy’oli
There.	Awo.
And this is what he said.	Era bino bye yayogera.
I loved everything, except that it wasn’t me	Buli kimu nnali njagala nnyo, okuggyako nti si nze
Which he should have been.	Kye yandibadde abeera.
Maybe he had.	Mpozzi nga yalina.
I thought it was really cool	Nalowooza nti ddala kyali kirungi nnyo
I can’t get enough.	Sisobola kumala.
You know, it was really hard.	Omanyi, ddala kyali kizibu.
I really hope this goes somewhere	Nsuubira ddala kino waliwo we kigenda
You have to go now.	Olina okugenda kati.
And of course he went with us.	Era ddala yagenda naffe.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
And he is.	Era ye.
He is mine, mine, mine.	Ye wange, wange, wange.
That’s really good for me.	Ekyo kirungi ddala gyendi.
Everyone is here.	Buli omu ali wano.
I said no problem and everything is fine.	Nagamba nti tewali buzibu era buli kimu kiri bulungi.
I think you know exactly what this is.	Ndowooza omanyi bulungi kino kye kiri.
Very good, he said.	Kirungi nnyo, bwe yagambye.
Maybe that's actually beauty.	Mpozzi ekyo mu butuufu bwe bulungi.
This is not one of those.	Kino si kye kimu ku ebyo.
I feel at home here.	Mpulira nga ndi waka wano.
I wonder if it’s the same	Nneebuuza oba naye kye kimu
I think we’re moving forward	Ndowooza tugenda mu maaso
And that’s very, very powerful.	Era ekyo kya maanyi nnyo nnyo.
I wonder a lot	Nze nneebuuza nnyo
I have no idea what it could be	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki kye kiyinza okuba
He has no urgency.	Talina bwangu bwonna.
I don’t want to believe this was happening	Saagala kukkiriza nti kino kyali kigenda mu maaso
To do it.	Okukikola.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I’ll be perfectly fine	Nja kuba bulungi ddala
This is what he needed.	Kino kye yali yeetaaga.
It looked great.	Kyali kirabika bulungi nnyo.
I really thought it would be hard	Nalowooza ddala nti kijja kuba kizibu
I needed a job and still do	Nnali nneetaaga omulimu era n’okutuusa kati
I wasn’t going to go to class	Nnali sigenda kugenda mu kibiina
This is the truth.	Kino kye kituufu.
But this can happen	Naye kino kiyinza okubaawo
He had always been friendly to me.	Bulijjo yali abadde wa mukwano gyendi.
Of course, I was ready	Kya lwatu nti nnali mwetegefu
I wanted to be a little more present	Nnali njagala kubeerawo katono
But of course .	Naye ddala .
I didn’t know what to do	Nnali simanyi kya kukola
And he does it.	Era akikola.
He can’t really say why.	Mu butuufu tasobola kwogera lwaki.
I don’t know what to do.	Nze simanyi kya kukola.
I just wanted to go.	Nnali njagala kugenda kyokka.
I love the food.	Njagala nnyo emmere.
I had nothing to do at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sirina kye nkola yonna
He didn’t want to talk to anyone.	Yali tayagala kwogera na muntu yenna.
I don’t have a system, yet	Sirina nkola, n’okutuusa kati
Almost everyone does it.	Kumpi buli muntu akikola.
I can’t say that about anyone but you	Ekyo siyinza kwogera ku muntu yenna okuggyako ggwe
I might go to jail	Nnyinza okugenda mu kkomera
That’s what he did.	Bw’atyo bwe yakola.
That wasn’t what it was.	Ekyo si kye kyali.
He may be the same.	Ayinza okuba nga naye.
It’s the same thing.	Kye kimu.
I think everybody did	Ndowooza buli omu yakikola
I didn’t want that.	Ekyo nnali saagala.
He should have known this.	Kino yandibadde akimanyi.
We have to do well.	Tulina okukola obulungi.
He may be all of that.	Ayinza okuba nga byonna ebyo.
But that is dangerous.	Naye ekyo kya bulabe.
Not in this city.	Si mu kibuga kino.
I have so much to do right now	Nnina bingi nnyo bye nnina okukola mu kiseera kino
But this will do the job.	Naye kino kijja kukola omulimu.
What a beautiful morning it would be.	Nga enkya yandibadde nnungi.
He went to work.	Yagenda ku mulimu.
I just wanted to be me	Nnali njagala kubeera nze kyokka
I could talk to my father	Nnali nsobola okwogera ne taata
Same thing with him.	Ekintu kye kimu naye.
But no one, really.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna, ddala.
He works harder than anyone.	Akola nnyo okusinga omuntu yenna.
Like that will happen.	Nga ekyo bwe kijja okubaawo.
Not in this hour.	Si mu ssaawa eno.
It’s just a problem.	Kizibu kyokka.
Definitely in the morning.	Mazima ddala ku makya.
You work last week.	Okola wiiki ewedde.
Everyone knew, no one allowed themselves to see.	Buli omu yali amanyi, tewali yakkiriza kulaba.
I wasn’t quite aware of this	Kino nnali simanyi bulungi
If he could do that, he could do anything.	Singa yali asobola okukola ekyo, yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
Maybe you love his personality.	Mpozzi oyagala nnyo omuntu we.
And you probably won’t know.	Era oboolyawo tojja kumanya.
I can’t see who it is.	Sisobola kulaba ani.
Nothing was real.	Tewali kyali kya ddala.
I knew there was one, but not where	Namanya nti waliwo emu, naye si wa
He couldn’t see anything.	Yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
Everyone thinks this is it.	Buli omu alowooza nti kino kye kiri.
I know it’s a dangerous job	Nkimanyi nti omulimu gwa bulabe
It’s more complicated than that.	Kizibu okusinga ekyo.
I didn’t want to be with him	Nnali saagala kubeera naye
He would do this himself.	Kino yandikoze ye kennyini.
Or so he believed.	Oba bwatyo bwe yakkiriza.
In this case.	Mu mbeera eno.
I think it’s a good idea.	Ndowooza nti ndowooza nnungi.
We’re fine tonight.	Tuli bulungi ekiro kino.
But it’s not me.	Naye si nze.
Would love to do it again.	Yandiyagadde nnyo okuddamu okukikola.
I was in a bad place	Nali mu kifo kibi
I don’t have the money.	Ssente nnina.
It’s nothing of the sort.	Si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
We should move forward.	Tusaanidde okugenda mu maaso.
It won’t work without it.	Tekijja kukola nga tewali.
He was better than that.	Yali asinga ekyo.
And, it seems likely.	Era, kirabika kiyinza.
And he’s going to get whoever.	Era agenda kufuna ani yenna.
I feel better this morning.	Mpulira bulungi enkya ya leero.
But he had to do it.	Naye yalina okukikola.
I won’t go to one.	Sijja kugenda ku emu.
I thought you .	Nalowooza nti ggwe .
I don’t care what office.	Sifaayo ofiisi ki.
You will do the same thing.	Naawe ojja kukola ekintu kye kimu.
I know you can.	Nkimanyi nti osobola.
But there is no money.	Naye tewali ssente.
He knew it wouldn't happen.	Yali akimanyi nti tekijja kubaawo.
It’s really easy.	Ddala kyangu.
He was ordinary.	Yali wa bulijjo.
However, I didn’t like every man	Kyokka nnali saagala buli musajja
I don’t know who he was	Simanyi ani gwe yali
I’m shopping.	Nze ndi mu kugula ebintu.
He knows how.	Amanyi engeri.
I still have it today	Nnina n’okutuusa leero
But he was still a child.	Naye nga akyali mwana.
But he thought he was safe.	Naye yalowooza nti talina bulabe.
It was a way to make money.	Yali ngeri ya kufuna ssente.
I knew whatever he said it would be	Nali nkimanyi nti kyonna kye yayogera kye kijja okuba
Nothing is more important than that.	Tewali kikulu okusinga ekyo.
I may have to get one.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnina okufuna emu.
I was in my room at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali mu kisenge kyange
That is why there is no such thing.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
That someone was me.	Nti omuntu yali nze.
I will work in the open.	Nja kukola mu lwatu.
No one quite knows what to do.	Tewali amanyi bulungi kya kukola.
The house is on approx.	Ennyumba eri ku nga.
And you may have the opportunity to read that book too.	Era naawe oyinza okufuna omukisa okusoma ekitabo ekyo.
He knows this, and he won’t.	Kino akimanyi, era tajja kukikola.
However, I have to get out of here	Kyokka nnina okuva wano
It’s easy to do.	Kyangu okukikola.
But it won’t do it.	Naye tekijja kukikola.
I know what they are now	Nze mmanyi kye bali kati
However, this was easier said than done.	Kyokka, kino kyali kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
I didn’t think anyone was down there	Nnali sirowooza nti waliwo omuntu yenna wansi
This is really powerful.	Eno ddala ya maanyi.
It’s just not good.	Si kirungi kyokka.
But he did things.	Naye yakola ebintu.
I just need to do this	Kino nneetaaga kukola kyokka
I wasn’t sure why at the time, but it felt right.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sikakasa lwaki naye nnali mpulira nga kituufu.
I think we can do it	Ndowooza tusobola okukikola
I couldn’t say or do anything.	Nnali sisobola kwogera wadde okukola ekintu kyonna.
I hope to do the same thing here	Nsuubira okukola ekintu kye kimu wano
We can hardly wait.	Tetusobola bulungi kulinda.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
But in reality it is not.	Naye mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
I am very curious.	Njagala nnyo okumanya.
We’ll play nice together, now.	Tujja kuzannya bulungi ffenna, kati.
You want in the.	Oyagala mu.
He doesn’t have to do it.	Talina kukikola.
I am going to love this.	Ngenda kwagala nnyo kino.
He had no money for that.	Ekyo yali talina ssente.
That’s not a bad thing to go	Ekyo si kibi okugenda
I have to know that he is a child.	Nnina okumanya nti mwana muto.
I don’t feel anything like that	Nze sirina kye mpulira nga ekyo
It’s not a serious thing.	Si kintu kya maanyi.
This is not easy to do.	Kino si kyangu kukikola.
That’s the thing.	Ekyo kye kintu.
There is no plan of action.	Tewali nteekateeka ya kukola.
Not from me.	Si okuva gyendi.
And it is very dangerous.	Era kya bulabe nnyo.
In fact, it isn’t.	Mu butuufu, si bwe kiri.
I know nothing about him	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ye
He has the power.	Alina amaanyi.
He can’t find anything.	Tasobola kufuna kintu.
I think this is very common	Ndowooza kino kya bulijjo nnyo
Like that might happen.	Nga ekyo bwe kiyinza okubaawo.
I didn’t know what to do or say	Nnali simanyi kya kukola oba kya kwogera
It’s not necessarily true.	Si kituufu nti kituufu.
I had no money, no car, and no job	Nnali sirina ssente, sirina mmotoka era nga sirina mulimu
But that’s basically not it.	Naye ekyo okusinga si kye kiri.
I wasn’t sure if he knew.	Nali sikakasa oba yali akimanyi.
You don’t have to do this, you know.	Kino tolina kukikola, omanyi.
You can pretty much say anything.	Osobola bulungi okwogera ekintu kyonna.
And he doesn’t have to be a guy here.	Era talina kuba ggaayi wano.
I think it’s a great idea.	Ndowooza nti kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
I could barely eat	Nnali nsobola bulungi okulya
I think maybe you’ve been working a little too hard	Ndowooza osanga obadde okola nnyo katono
I wasn’t sure he would	Nnali sikakasa nti ajja kukikola
Nothing really appears.	Tewali kintu kyonna ddala kye kirabika.
I could see the problem	Nnali nsobola okulaba ekizibu
I was hoping you would	Nali nsuubira nti ojja kukikola
I will know exactly where you are	Nja kumanya bulungi gyoli
I think he was a good man.	Ndowooza yali musajja mulungi.
I don’t know where to go from here.	Simanyi wa gye nnyinza kugenda okuva wano.
He thought of everything.	Yalowooza ku buli kimu.
I will do this.	Kino nja kukikola.
I thought you would be here.	Nalowooza nti wandibadde wano.
I’m sure it will come back	Nkakasa nti kijja kuddamu
Yet it just isn’t.	Ye kyokka si bwe kiri.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Si kintu kyangu kukola.
I might have known it.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnali nkimanyi.
I can’t do it.	Nze sisobola kukikola.
I have to get to the house.	Nnina okutuuka mu nnyumba.
Maybe he thought we were going to be friends.	Mpozzi yalowooza nti tugenda kubeera ba mukwano.
I know I’m not the only one.	Nkimanyi si nze nzekka.
We have a whole night ahead of us.	Tulina ekiro kyonna mu maaso.
I hope he comes home soon	Nsuubira nti ajja kudda awaka mangu
Maybe no one will.	Mpozzi tewali muntu yenna ajja kukikola.
I thought it was there	Nalowooza nti kyali awo
Or tried to do it.	Oba yagezaako okukikola.
Everybody knows everybody.	Buli muntu amanyi buli muntu.
But it’s okay.	Naye kiri bulungi.
I can’t have everything	Sisobola kuba na buli kimu
There is something.	Waliwo ekintu.
We’ll both be fine.	Ffembi tujja kuba bulungi.
But you don’t have to tell anyone.	Naye tolina kubuulira muntu yenna.
And he did that very well	Era ekyo yakikola bulungi nnyo
This is not a quick one.	Eno si ya mangu.
He didn’t want to tell the truth.	Yali tayagala kwogera mazima.
I know what he needs	Nze mmanyi kye yeetaaga
I didn’t know what was going on at the time, really.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi kigenda mu maaso, ddala.
I couldn’t tell which.	Nnali sisobola kumanya ki.
I guess this is the problem	Ntebereza nti kino kye kizibu
He may have had an eating disorder	Ayinza okuba nga yalina obuzibu mu kulya
However, I will not be here	Kyokka sijja kubeera wano
There is just nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyokka.
Surely you know that.	Mazima ekyo okimanyi.
He's a 'person.	Ye 'omuntu.
What is this?.	Kiki kino?.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
Lucky, of course.	Omukisa, ddala.
He will be hitting.	Ajja kuba akuba.
I wondered what they were	Nali nneebuuza kye bali
That was the thing.	Ekyo kye kyali ekintu.
I loved the floor	Nnali njagala nnyo wansi
I needed to act quickly.	Nnali nneetaaga okukola amangu.
You know so many things.	Omanyi ebintu bingi nnyo.
I am a very good person.	Ndi muntu mulungi nnyo.
I don’t have anything.	Nze sirina kintu kyonna.
This will be terrible.	Kino kijja kuba kibi nnyo.
I don’t know at all.	Simanyi n’akatono.
I want to be an artist	Njagala kubeera muyimbi
Let everyone do their thing.	Buli muntu akole ekintu kye.
I didn’t know they were here	Nnali simanyi nti bali wano
That's me.	Oyo nze.
I have nothing to do with it	Sirina kye nnyinza kukikola
It was easier than that.	Kyali kyangu okusinga ekyo.
It would be good for both of them.	Kyandibadde kirungi eri bombi.
We are the same.	Ffe tuli kimu.
But you are my wife.	Naye ggwe mukyala wange.
I don’t think that’s the case though.	Sirowooza nti bwe kiri wadde.
Dad isn’t really with her.	Taata mu butuufu tali naye.
I’m going too.	Nze nange ngenda.
He was probably fine.	Oboolyawo yali bulungi.
Morning.	Ku makya.
I don’t have an agenda, really	Sirina agenda, ddala
I know what’s going on	Nze mmanyi ekigenda mu maaso
I don’t want it here.	Saagala wano.
My wife, he said.	Mukyala wange, bwe yagamba.
And you don’t know .	Era tomanyi .
There is nothing wrong in knowing that.	Tewali kibi kyonna mu kumanya ekyo.
I thought maybe she needed to say some things.	Nalowooza nti osanga waliwo ebintu bye yali yeetaaga okwogera.
I feel so happy for my father	Mpulira nga ndi musanyufu nnyo ku lwa taata
I wanted to know what he was really thinking.	Nnali njagala okumanya kye yali alowooza ddala.
He had been happy to do it.	Yali abadde musanyufu okukikola.
Surely you want to.	Mazima ddala ggwe oyagala.
I just wanted to do this	Kino nnali njagala kukola kyokka
And he knew it.	Era yali amanyi.
I thought he would.	Nalowooza nti ajja kukikola.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
I know you want to help	Nkimanyi nti oyagala kuyamba
I could have everything	Nnali nsobola okuba ne buli kimu
But there is a problem.	Naye waliwo obuzibu.
Now it was true.	Kati kyali kituufu.
He did a good job, too.	Yakola omulimu omulungi, naye.
But it’s not, of course.	Naye si bwe kiri, ddala.
No one can do wrong to you.	Ggwe tewali asobola kukola kibi.
I have something to say	Nnina kye nnina okwogera
I know you want too	Nkimanyi naawe ayagala
I wanted to see what you were doing	Nnali njagala okulaba kye wali okola
However, I probably should	Kyokka, oboolyawo nsaanidde okukikola
Or they were in his place.	Oba baali mu kifo kye.
I wanted to go with him too	Nange nnali njagala nnyo okugenda naye
Everything will be fine	Buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi
That wasn’t the issue.	Eyo si ye yali ensonga.
That’s good for me.	Ekyo kirungi gyendi.
If he did this, if he did that.	Singa kino yakikola, singa ekyo yakikola.
He had to speak.	Yalina okwogera.
There they were.	Eyo gye baali.
I can hardly wait.	Sisobola bulungi kulinda.
Too bad, it was good.	Kibi nnyo, kyali kirungi.
He is not here.	Tali wano.
Maybe that was the point.	Mpozzi eyo ye yali ensonga.
I needed my job	Nnali nneetaaga omulimu gwange
I really, really, am	Nze ddala, ddala, ndi
I thought you wanted this.	Nalowooza nti kino oyagala.
That no one should ever live like he had to.	Nti tewali muntu yenna alina kubeera nga bwe yalina.
I don’t know, really.	Simanyi, ddala.
He had no appetite.	Yali talina njagala ya kulya.
It was so close to myself.	Kyali kumpi nnyo nange kennyini.
He wasn’t real.	Yali si wa ddala.
I want to be a guy	Njagala kubeera ggaayi
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
It doesn’t matter.	Si nsonga.
He had nothing.	Yali talina ky’alina.
I’m not really good and pretty	Mu butuufu siri mulungi era mulungi
That’s really important.	Ekyo kikulu ddala.
That is what it is for us.	Ekyo kye kiri gye tuli.
I think we’re in the hospital	Ndowooza tuli mu ddwaaliro
I was on my way home.	Nnali ngenda okudda eka.
Maybe it was true.	Mpozzi nga kyali kituufu.
I’m thinking about you a lot	Nze ndowooza nnyo ku ggwe
I really need to talk to you	Nze ddala nneetaaga okwogera naawe
No one had an opinion.	Tewali yalina ndowooza.
I don’t want to talk to anyone	Saagala kwogera na muntu yenna
But it will work for one night.	Naye kijja kukola okumala ekiro kimu.
It’s not real or important.	Si kya ddala oba kikulu.
I wish we could all think about this	Njagala nnyo ffenna okulowooza ku nsonga eno
And this is a bad thing.	Era kino kintu kibi.
He couldn’t believe it, he didn’t want to believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza, yali tayagala kukkiriza.
He is not from here.	Si wa wano.
Either way, it won’t be a problem.	Mu ngeri yonna, tekijja kuba kizibu.
I wasn’t ready to do that	Ekyo nnali siri mwetegefu kukikola
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Not that that matters at all.	Si nti ekyo kikulu n’akatono.
I am of course.	Nze mazima.
She was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo, nga mulungi nnyo.
He is very young.	Muto nnyo.
But you might as well.	Naye oyinza okuba nga naawe.
I want to be like you	Njagala kubeera nga ggwe
I don’t think in that way.	Sirowooza mu ngeri eyo.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I know, she thought	Nkimanyi, bwe yalowooza
I think that’s all we can do right now	Ndowooza ekyo kyokka kye tusobola okukola mu kiseera kino
His brother is here.	Muganda we ali wano.
I’ll do what you want	Nja kukola ky’oyagala
It’s not either one or the other.	Si oba omu oba omulala.
He had no answer.	Yali talina kya kuddamu.
Probably very well.	Oboolyawo bulungi nnyo.
You have to talk to him.	Olina okwogera naye.
Together with.	Wamu ne...
That wasn’t the case for me.	Ekyo si bwe kyali gyendi.
Obviously, this is not true.	Kya lwatu nti kino si kituufu.
I am so happy to be home.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera awaka.
Almost, but not quite.	Kumpi, naye si kituufu.
I want to see the point here	Njagala okulaba ensonga wano
That would be a normal situation.	Ekyo kyandibadde mbeera ya bulijjo.
I like to talk a lot about everything	Njagala nnyo okwogera ennyo ku buli kimu
I won’t go back down at that time	Sijja kudda wansi mu kiseera ekyo
I want to be with you	Njagala kubeera naawe
He is happy to do so.	Musanyufu okukikola.
I couldn’t do anything on my schedule	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna ku nteekateeka yange
I need to step back a bit	Nze nneetaaga okudda emabega katono
I have one.	Nnina emu.
You know it’s true.	Omanyi nti kituufu.
you think.	ggwe olowooza.
I couldn’t have gone on without you	Nnali sisobola kugenda mu maaso singa si ggwe
I really don’t know why.	Ddala simanyi lwaki.
Who knows if anything will happen.	Ani amanyi oba waliwo ekigenda okubaawo.
I’m not sure that.	Sikakasa nti.
I'll be back here.	Nja kudda wano.
I think that’s what it is	Ndowooza ekyo kye kiri
And that’s what it was.	Era ekyo kye kyali.
Someone had to do it.	Waliwo omuntu yalina okukikola.
I feel really lucky that way	Mpulira nga ddala ndi wa mukisa mu ngeri eyo
And that to me is a problem.	Era ekyo gyendi kizibu.
Apparently this is true.	Kirabika kino kituufu.
He loved it here.	Yali ayagala nnyo wano.
But he won’t do it.	Naye tajja kukikola.
It was his son.	Yali mwana we.
He cannot speak at this time.	Tasobola kwogera mu kiseera kino.
I don’t think anyone knew exactly what was going to happen.	Sirowooza nti waliwo omuntu yenna yali amanyi bulungi ekigenda okubaawo.
I would like to say that	Njagala okugamba nti
I can’t believe he would do that	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ekyo yandikoze
You are what it is.	Ggwe kye kiri.
I really was.	Nze ddala nnali.
Maybe he did it.	Mpozzi nga ye yakikola.
I know that you do.	Nkimanyi nti ggwe okola.
I can’t believe how good you are	Siyinza kukkiriza ngeri gy’oli mulungi
It was time to move on.	Kyali kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
You might be mine.	Oyinza okuba nga wange.
I know it’s not easy being here	Nkimanyi nti si kyangu kubeera wano
I won’t help here	Sijja kuyamba wano
I was there, you know	Nze nali awo, omanyi
I really wanted to do it	Nnali njagala kukikola ddala
He wanted to be with her.	Yali ayagala kubeera naye.
Not now, but at the time, it was.	Si kati, naye mu kiseera ekyo, bwe kyali.
I was glad he did	Nnali musanyufu nti yakikola
Anyone can do it.	Omuntu yenna asobola okukikola.
I think that might help	Ndowooza ekyo kiyinza okuyamba
That’s all there is to it.	Ekyo kye kyokka.
There is nothing there.	Tewali kintu kyonna kiri awo.
I guess it was something he felt	Ntebereza nti kyali kintu kye yawulira
And you are me.	Era ggwe nze.
I could achieve so much more	Nnali nsobola okutuuka ku bingi nnyo
She was in much better shape than she thought.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
Neither man spoke.	Tewali musajja yenna yayogera.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
But there are many.	Naye bingi.
I’ve loved everybody	Nze buli muntu abadde ayagala nnyo
I will not live with this	Sijja kubeera na kino
But it’s really great.	Naye ddala kirungi nnyo.
Or one week.	Oba wiiki emu.
No one came.	Tewali yajja.
We'll see.	Tujja kulaba.
I’ve been thinking about that a lot.	Ekyo mbadde ndowooza nnyo.
Now I don’t know.	Kati simanyi.
He was good for a person.	Yali mulungi eri omuntu.
He knows how important it is.	Amanyi nti kikulu nnyo.
We are in luck.	Tuli mu mukisa.
And here we are.	Era wano we tuli.
This point, and that.	Ensonga eno, era eyo.
I still couldn’t tell.	N’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kumanya.
I really think we should talk.	Nze ddala ndowooza nti tusaanidde okwogera.
It’s going to stay there.	Kigenda kusigala awo.
I really don’t know what it is.	Mazima ddala simanyi kiki.
That’s what we have now.	Ekyo kye tulina kati.
I always knew when she had been with him	Bulijjo nnali mmanyi ddi lwe yali abadde naye
However, this is a good thing.	Kyokka kino kintu kirungi.
Point here, point there	Ensonga wano, ensonga eyo
The weather is fine.	Obudde buli bulungi.
All that we have.	Byonna bye tulina.
I know just being him	Nze mmanyi okubeera ye yekka
He couldn’t be a man.	Yali tasobola kuba musajja.
This is all fine and very simple.	Kino kyonna kirungi era kyangu nnyo.
I just wanted to talk to him	Nnali njagala kwogera naye kyokka
I think it will work	Ndowooza kijja kukola
I knew we could do it.	Nnali nkimanyi nti tusobola okukikola.
I really didn’t know	Nze ddala nali simanyi
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
Now, what are we going to do about it?.	Kati, tugenda kukikola ki?.
I couldn’t really speak.	Mu butuufu nnali sisobola kwogera.
I have to be like.	Nze alina okuba nga.
He told me he loved my work.	Yang’amba nti ayagala nnyo omulimu gwange.
Thinking is, well, difficult.	Okulowooza, bulungi, kizibu.
I wonder if he does	Nze nneebuuza oba akola bw’atyo
I have to win anyway	Nnina okuwangula mu ngeri yonna
I thought he did that himself	Nnalowooza nti ekyo ye kennyini yakikola
And that’s not a good thing.	Era ekyo si kintu kirungi.
I think he is a good person	Ndowooza muntu mulungi
I was thinking thinking.	Nali ndowooza nga ndowooza.
I think maybe he’s not the only one.	Ndowooza osanga si ye yekka.
I don’t know what to do	Nze simanyi kya kukola
Occupation.	Omulimu.
But you were young.	Naye ggwe wali muto.
He was terrified.	Yali atya nnyo.
I had the same problem.	Nze nali nfunye ekizibu kye kimu.
This is what they are.	Kino kye bali.
This is easily seen as below.	Kino kyangu okulaba nga bwe kiri wansi.
He was really good.	Ddala yali mulungi.
I'll be back in an hour	Nja kudda mu ssaawa emu
I think that’s dangerous.	Ndowooza ekyo kya bulabe.
Either that or.	Oba ekyo oba.
I didn’t know where he was	Nnali simanyi gye yali
I know what he wants to do	Nze mmanyi ky’ayagala okukola
It was good for the work.	Kyali kirungi eri omulimu.
That’s not really the problem.	Ekyo mu butuufu si kye kizibu.
Apparently he was asleep.	Kirabika yali yeebase.
I can’t have a girlfriend	Sisobola kuba na muganzi
Maybe too much too much.	Mpozzi nnyo nnyo.
He is very vulnerable	Ali mu bulabe nnyo
She was really nice.	Ddala yali mulungi nnyo.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
I was almost alone there	Nze kumpi nnali nzekka eyo
I didn’t know what to say	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera
That’s what he loves.	Ekyo ky’ayagala ennyo.
He knew hunger.	Yali amanyi enjala.
I think a lot myself.	Nze kennyini ndowooza nnyo.
I actually wanted to go	Mu butuufu nnali njagala kugenda
That’s normal.	Ekyo kya bulijjo.
I couldn’t believe it when she told me	Nali siyinza kukkiriza bwe yang’amba
I have to do it	Nnina okukikola
I had no choice about that	Ekyo nnali sirina kya kukola
Now it can be much easier.	Kati kiyinza okuba nga kyangu nnyo.
That’s not really the case.	Ekyo mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
He prayed with her in his room.	Yasaba naye mu kisenge kye.
On his day.	Ku lunaku lwe.
The whole arrangement is complete.	Enteekateeka yonna ewedde.
Here you can earn a lot of money in a short period of time.	Eno osobola okufuna ssente nnyingi mu bbanga ttono.
He looked almost asleep already.	Yalabika nga kumpi yeebase dda.
No, no one at all.	Nedda, tewali muntu yenna n’akatono.
I wanted to be part of that group	Nnali njagala kubeera mu kibiina ekyo
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
I feel better now	Mpulira bulungi kati
Or who goes down.	Oba ani agenda wansi.
But not everyone.	Naye si buli muntu.
I thought that was my idea	Nalowooza nti ekyo kye kirowoozo kyange
I want to move on.	Njagala kugenda mu maaso.
Everyone knows that much.	Buli omu amanyi ekyo bingi.
For about an hour.	Okumala essaawa nga emu.
You have to say it’s not bad.	Olina okugamba nti si kibi.
He couldn't allow it to go on he knew.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza kugenda mu maaso yali amanyi.
You know it would be.	Omanyi nti kyandibadde.
It’s hard to think of any reason.	Kizibu okulowooza ku nsonga yonna.
There is just nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyokka.
Not like us.	Si nga ffe.
And that’s what’s important.	Era ekyo kye kikulu.
We were really in trouble.	Ddala twali mu buzibu.
He is happy now.	Ali musanyufu kati.
But why does it matter.	Naye lwaki kikulu.
The age is yes.	Si ye ye.
I’m so scared.	Nze ntya nnyo.
I'm afraid.	Nze ntya.
I couldn’t believe he was talking about me	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti yali ayogera ku nze
I thought there was hope with him	Nalowooza nti waliwo essuubi naye
I wanted to hit someone	Nnali njagala okukuba omuntu
I hope they are really well	Nsuubira nti ddala bali bulungi
But he will, he will.	Naye ajja kukikola, ajja kukikola.
I want a friend	Njagala mukwano
He was well aware of the plan.	Yali amanyi bulungi enteekateeka eyo.
I think it was the same with him	Ndowooza naye kyali kye kimu
He could do whatever he wanted.	Yali asobola okukola kyonna kye yali ayagala.
Not with the police.	Si ne poliisi.
It was a serious problem.	Kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I couldn’t be happier than she thought	Siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga bwe yalowooza
I’m sure he’ll want to talk to you	Nkakasa nti ajja kwagala okwogera naawe
I have nothing to say	Sirina kye nnyinza kwogera
I am well aware of that	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi
But.	Naye.
I didn’t know he had it in him	Nnali simanyi nti yalina mu ye
No one did anything.	Tewali yakola kintu kyonna.
I hope any of us can	Nsuubira nti waliwo ku ffe asobola
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
I want to know what’s going on.	Njagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso.
I can’t go home	Sisobola kudda waka
From person to person.	Okuva ku muntu okudda ku muntu.
He couldn’t let that happen.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
That's the same thing.	Ebyo kintu kye kimu.
She looked great indeed.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo ddala.
I don’t really care.	Nze sifaayo nnyo.
I’ve got plenty of time.	Nfunye obudde bungi.
No one will come.	Tewali ajja kujja.
I need a week.	Nze nneetaaga wiiki emu.
I hear behind me	Mpulira emabega wange
No one will know.	Tewali ajja kumanya.
I was dangerous to them	Nnali wa bulabe gye bali
Everyone absolutely loves it.	Buli muntu ayagala nnyo ddala.
Whatever you want.	Kyonna ky’oyagala.
Not at the moment.	Si mu kiseera kino.
Every time.	Buli kiseera.
I think he should have moved on	Ndowooza yandibadde agenda mu maaso
Not quite right yet.	Si kituufu nnyo n’okutuusa kati.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
I thought it would be great	Nalowooza nti kijja kuba kirungi nnyo
Talking to him.	Okwogera naye.
I think he was on to something	Ndowooza yali ku kintu
Nothing was the same.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyali kye kimu.
But you have to do things.	Naye olina okukola ebintu.
I can’t believe he did this.	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kino yakikola.
I am very, very sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo nnyo.
I thought it was very realistic	Nalowooza nti kyali kya ddala nnyo
I wasn’t the one he wanted to see.	Si nze gwe yali ayagala okulaba.
In the circumstances.	Mu mbeera.
I want that too	Nze nange njagala eyo
I'm not exactly sure	Sikakasa bulungi ddala
You think you are doing well.	Olowooza nti okola bulungi.
And you have to.	Era olina.
Why are we	Lwaki tuli .
But something is going right.	Naye waliwo ekigenda obulungi.
He was really, wasn't he.	Yali ddala, si bwe kiri.
You know what, it doesn’t really matter.	Omanyi ki, mu butuufu si kikulu.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
I wondered so many things at the time	Nneebuuza ebintu bingi nnyo mu kiseera ekyo
And not too much.	Era si nnyo.
He doesn't want to.	Tayagala.
It’s really powerful.	Ddala kya maanyi.
I should do .	Nsaanidde okukola .
He says it doesn’t matter, it’s nothing.	Agamba nti si kikulu, si kintu.
He said no to a lot.	Yagamba nti nedda ku bingi.
I can’t live without you	Siyinza kubeera nga tolina ggwe
And it’s perfectly true that you can.	Era kituufu nnyo nti osobola.
I didn’t want to know what was going on	Nnali saagala kumanya kigenda mu maaso
I was feeling good already	Nali mpulira bulungi dda
I always wanted myself.	Bulijjo nnali njagala nze kennyini.
What is this.	Kiki kino.
And then he knew.	Era awo n’amanya.
I wonder what it will be	Nze nneebuuza nti kijja kuba ki
I was already in love with him	Nali dda mu mukwano naye
And now it is.	Era kati bwe kiri.
They are not at all.	Si bwe bali n’akatono.
It’s a really good feeling.	Ddala mpulira nnungi.
In fact, everyone was asleep.	Mu butuufu, buli omu yali yeebase.
Not on this one.	Si ku kino.
But I don’t like it	Kyokka sikyagala
This will not be easy.	Kino tekijja kuba kyangu.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
That’s important here.	Ekyo kikulu wano.
And I feel so much better	Era mpulira bulungi nnyo
Now he was coming.	Kati yali ajja.
Such a nice guy.	Ggaayi omulungi bw'atyo.
He did that.	Yakola ekyo.
He shouldn’t do that.	Ekyo tasaanidde kukikola.
I'll work now.	Nja kukola kati.
I don’t know anyone here	Wano sirina gwe mmanyi
I love living there.	Njagala nnyo okubeera eyo.
I didn’t know where he was	Nnali simanyi gye yali
You are my best friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange asinga.
I couldn’t answer and I didn’t know	Nnali sisobola kuddamu era nga simanyi
I couldn’t see into his room	Nnali sisobola kulaba mu kisenge kye
It doesn’t matter if he did or not.	Si kikulu oba yakikola oba nedda.
This might work.	Kino kiyinza okukola.
I hope you’ll see.	Nsuubira nti ojja kulaba.
He needs me to do it.	Yeetaaga nze okukikola.
I need to get back to work	Nze nneetaaga okudda ku mulimu
The house was very nice.	Ennyumba yali nnungi nnyo.
It was time to go.	Kyali kiseera kya kugenda.
He was about that.	Yali ku nsonga eyo.
Any help please.	Obuyambi bwonna nsaba.
He has his money too, you know.	Alina ne ssente ze, omanyi.
We are friends now.	Tuli ba mukwano kati.
No one has it.	Tewali muntu yenna alina.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
He knew it though.	Yali akimanyi wadde.
For a long time no one could speak.	Okumala ebbanga ddene nga tewali yali asobola kwogera.
But not this much.	Naye si kino nnyo.
It may be that	Kiyinza okuba nga .
I really need to know everything now	Mazima ddala nneetaaga okumanya buli kimu kati
I knew he wasn’t going to answer	Namanya nti yali tagenda kuddamu
He was always friendly.	Bulijjo yali wa mukwano.
I could never have any of that again	Nnali siyinza kuddamu kufuna kintu kyonna ku ebyo
It’s not very common.	Si kya bulijjo nnyo.
I just wanted that.	Ekyo nnali njagala kyokka.
But he was very happy.	Naye yali musanyufu nnyo.
I love this watch.	Njagala nnyo essaawa eno.
Today he was powerless.	Leero yali talina maanyi.
I guess everyone probably has.	Ntebereza buli omu osanga alina.
I thought he was doing pretty well	Nalowooza nti abadde akola bulungi nnyo
I want to go home safely	Njagala kudda waka nga sirina bulabe
I want to talk to you.	Njagala okwogera naawe.
You should read that book.	Olina okusoma ekitabo ekyo.
I’m not going to do that	Ekyo sigenda kukikola
I know what night it is.	Nze mmanyi ekiro ki.
And this morning.	Era enkya ya leero.
I am sure you will do very well.	Nkakasa nti ojja kukola bulungi nnyo.
He tells everyone he is fine.	Agamba buli muntu nti ali bulungi.
He said that he was not.	Yagamba nti si bwe yali.
Like in, now.	Nga mu, kati.
I want to do this right	Kino njagala kukikola bulungi
Of course, we all need money.	Kya lwatu nti ffenna twetaaga ssente.
He is with her now.	Ali naye kati.
You are like me.	Ggwe oli nga nze.
I think I do.	Ndowooza nti nkola.
He certainly will though.	Mazima ddala ajja kukikola wadde.
I think maybe you could	Ndowooza osanga oyinza okukikola
He had to be away from home for a very long time.	Yalina okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo nga tali waka.
This is really good.	Kino ddala kirungi.
I thought it was him.	Nnalowooza nti ye yali.
There is no problem here.	Wano tewali buzibu bwonna.
I think you should talk to my dad	Ndowooza olina okwogera ne taata wange
I need to get to work	Nze nneetaaga okutuuka ku mulimu
You know that yourself.	Ekyo ggwe kennyini okimanyi.
I am very happy to be here	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano
The food was excellent.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
Or everything else is.	Oba buli kimu bwe kiri.
I didn’t know you were here	Nze nali simanyi nti oli wano
A lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi.
I think that’s what it is now.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kiri kati.
And he's there.	Era ali awo.
Like really, now.	Nga ddala, kati.
Every hour of every day.	Buli ssaawa buli lunaku.
I know it’s not true	Nkimanyi nti si kituufu
I have something to do	Nnina kye nkola
Too many hours.	Ssaawa nnyingi nnyo.
I’m a little hesitant to go at all.	Nze ntya katono okugenda n’akatono.
I definitely know that	Ekyo ddala nkimanyi
I hope that goes well	Nsuubira nti ekyo kigenda bulungi
I don’t think you can.	Sirowooza nti osobola.
He was happy now, very happy.	Yali musanyufu kati, nga musanyufu nnyo.
I really should know	Mazima ddala nsaanidde okumanya
I may have nothing on	Nnyinza okuba nga sirina kintu kyonna ku
I live very close	Mbeera kumpi nnyo
It can be, of course.	Kiyinza okuba, kya lwatu.
I don’t know what it is.	Simanyi kiki.
I couldn’t stay for very long	Nnali sisobola kubeerawo okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo
Now he felt better.	Kati yawulira bulungi.
He is here with me now.	Ali wano nange kati.
He could do this.	Kino yali asobola okukikola.
More than he expected.	Okusinga okusinga bwe yali asuubira.
You go to them.	Ggwe ogenda gye bali.
But, it is just one thing.	Naye, kye kintu kimu kyokka.
It was really difficult	Ddala kyali kizibu
You are nothing to me.	Ggwe toli kintu kyonna gyendi.
However, this is not actually the case.	Kyokka, kino mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
It won’t even work.	Tekijja na kukola.
I couldn’t do anything.	Nnali sirina kye nsobola kukola.
Not really, anyway.	Si ddala, mu ngeri yonna.
I didn’t know it was him	Nnali simanyi nti ye ye
I think you should come with me now	Ndowooza wandibadde ojja nange kati
I’m sure it’s a matter of money.	Nkakasa nti nsonga ya ssente.
But there was something he needed to do now.	Naye waliwo kye yali yeetaaga okukola kati.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
I know you know better than that.	Nkimanyi nti ggwe omanyi okusinga ekyo.
He could see as well.	Yali asobola okulaba nga bwe kiri.
I work much better this way	Nkola bulungi nnyo mu ngeri eno
I can’t do anything about that.	Ekyo sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
They are busy.	Bali bbize.
I hope you don’t get anything down	Nsuubira nti tolina ky’okka wansi
I won’t say anything.	Sijja kwogera kintu kyonna.
Apparently he did too.	Kirabika naye bwe yakola.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
Until he is.	Okutuusa ye.
Better there than here.	Kirungi eyo okusinga wano.
When I was nearby.	Nga ndi kumpi.
But that was wrong.	Naye ekyo kyali kibi.
I had no friends.	Nnali sirina mikwano.
But it is very common.	Naye kya bulijjo nnyo.
You are very happy.	Oli musanyufu nnyo.
It’s the car.	Ye mmotoka.
It’s a serious issue.	Ensonga ya maanyi.
But he didn’t seem to.	Naye yalabika nga si bw’atyo.
You come with a little bit	Ojja n’akatono
I didn’t know anyone in that place.	Mu kifo ekyo nnali simanyi muntu yenna.
We will do that.	Ekyo tujja kukikola.
Or, well, he has access to the person we need.	Oba, bulungi, alina okutuuka ku muntu gwe twetaaga.
That’s very, very important.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo nnyo.
He is a dangerous man.	Ye musajja wa bulabe.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
I love watching her work	Njagala nnyo okulaba ng’akola
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
Nobody does that today.	Ekyo tewali akikola leero.
That’s not an answer.	Ekyo si kya kuddamu.
There is no acquisition process.	Tewali nkola ya kufuna.
We just have to do it.	Tulina okukikola kyokka.
What he had.	Kye yalina.
But he did better than that.	Naye yakola bulungi okusinga ekyo.
Of course, these are not the same thing.	Kya lwatu nti bino si kintu kye kimu.
I have no idea about this.	Kino sirina kye mmanyi.
I didn’t know what to do with it	Nnali simanyi kya kukikola
I might be myself.	Nnyinza okuba nga nze kennyini.
I can’t quite believe it	Siyinza bulungi kukkiriza
I didn’t even want to go	Nnali saagala na kugenda
It’s actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
No one said it would be easy.	Tewali yagamba nti kijja kuba kyangu.
I can never be with him again	Siyinza kuddamu kubeera naye
And the money.	Ne ssente.
You really should.	Ddala wandibadde okola.
And that was fine with me.	Era ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
There is also a problem.	Waliwo era kizibu.
I didn’t have a car and we were in town.	Nnali sirina mmotoka era twali mu kibuga.
However, I do know what to expect	Kyokka nze mmanyi kye nsuubira
I really have to be going.	Ddala nnina okuba nga ngenda.
He doesn’t like the city.	Tayagala kibuga.
I won’t say anything	Sijja kwogera kintu kyonna
I knew this was my chance.	Namanya nti guno gwe mukisa gwange.
I’m so sick of this	Nze ndi mulwadde nnyo ku nsonga eno
I don’t really know what that is	Ekyo simanyi bulungi kye ki
So far, so good.	N’okutuusa kati, kirungi nnyo.
And there was someone else in the background.	Era nga waliwo omuntu omulala emabega.
I think it will last awhile.	Ndowooza kijja kumala akaseera.
This is what we have to do.	Kino kye tulina okukola.
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
I’m not the only one who works all the time.	Si nze nzekka akola buli kiseera.
Another admitted that there was nothing to live for.	Omulala yakkiriza nti tewali kya kubeerawo.
But he had a point.	Naye yalina ensonga.
He had him.	Yalina ye.
You don’t know what it is.	Tomanyi kiki.
And it was dangerous.	Era kyali kya bulabe.
He’s going to be a player.	Agenda kubeera muzannyi.
I was very happy with him	Nali musanyufu nnyo naye
After he has done so.	Nga amaze okukikola.
That to them, of course, was the case.	Ekyo gye bali, ddala, bwe kyali.
But he doesn’t have to.	Naye talina kukikola.
It really is as simple as that.	Ddala kyangu nga ekyo.
I was sorry to see it go	Nnali nsonyiwa okulaba nga kigenda
Maybe that was a good thing.	Mpozzi ekyo kyali kintu kirungi.
I knew this would happen	Nali nkimanyi nti kino kijja kubaawo
In fact, he hadn’t.	Mu butuufu, yali talina.
I guess he’s going to try	Ntebereza nti agenda kugezaako
I can do it	Nsobola okukikola
Just like you wanted.	Nga bwe wali oyagala.
Today they are not.	Leero si bwe bali.
I want to talk to you again soon	Njagala okuddamu okwogera naawe mu bbanga ttono
I desperately needed a car	Nnali nneetaaga nnyo mmotoka
I am glad to read this.	Ndi musanyufu okusoma bino.
To him it wasn’t.	Eri ye si bwe kyali.
I didn’t know he was here	Nnali simanyi nti yali wano
You could do that, anyway.	Oyinza okukola ekyo, mu ngeri yonna.
I need to talk to him about it right away	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye ku nsonga eyo amangu ddala
Always has been and always will be.	Bulijjo abadde era bulijjo ajja kuba.
There they were.	Eyo gye baali.
I won’t do that here	Ekyo sijja kukikola wano
You know what you want and we will do it.	Omanyi kyoyagala era tujja kukikola.
Maybe he was, too.	Mpozzi naye bwe yali.
I needed time to think.	Nnali nneetaaga obudde okulowooza.
But he didn’t know.	Naye yali tamanyi.
He did everything he had to do.	Yakola buli kye yali alina okukola.
That is exactly the truth.	Ekyo kye kituufu ddala.
I know when to say no	Nze mmanyi ddi lwe nnina okugamba nti nedda
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
Here we go.	Wano we tugenda.
I didn’t know and it didn’t matter.	Nali simanyi era nga si kikulu.
He knew what he was planning.	Yali amanyi kye yali ateekateeka.
I want to know everything now	Njagala kumanya buli kimu kati
Each and every day.	Buli lunaku na buli lunaku.
This is not quite true.	Kino si kituufu nnyo.
I didn’t know what to do with this	Kino nnali simanyi kye nnyinza kukola
I’ve always loved it	Bulijjo mbadde njagala nnyo
I could have gone to jail	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu kkomera
That person.	Omuntu oyo.
I really just wanted to talk to you	Mu butuufu nnali njagala kwogera naawe kyokka
He will stay with us.	Ajja kusigala naffe.
I almost wish he would	Kumpi njagala yandikoze
I think he’s going to do very well.	Ndowooza agenda kukola bulungi nnyo.
I don’t care.	Sifaayo.
Maybe it will go away.	Mpozzi kijja kugenda.
I'm a little scared too	Nange ntya katono
He just wanted to know.	Yali ayagala kumanya kyokka.
It was just what we needed	Kyali kye twali twetaaga kyokka
And we will do it.	Era tujja kukikola.
But he was alone.	Naye yali yekka.
I wanted to be human	Nnali njagala kubeera muntu
It can be powerful.	Kiyinza okuba nga kya maanyi.
Nothing really important.	Tewali kintu kikulu ddala.
This comes in three forms.	Kino kijja mu ngeri ssatu.
I think maybe it’s luck	Ndowooza osanga gwe mukisa
I got a call today	Essimu nfunye leero
I’m afraid of everything.	Ntya buli kimu.
He wanted her to do well.	Yali ayagala akole bulungi.
But now he is in trouble.	Naye kati ali mu buzibu.
You'll have to wait.	Ojja kulinda.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
I didn’t want to continue with that idea.	Nnali saagala kugenda mu maaso na ndowooza eyo.
In a way it doesn’t really matter.	Mu ngeri emu si kikulu nnyo.
I wondered where he was	Nneebuuza gye yali
He's almost here.	Ali kumpi wano.
No one except.	Tewali muntu yenna okuggyako.
Do you think they are.	Olowooza bwe bali.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
And it’s an all-in-one approach	Era nkola ya buli kimu
I couldn’t be happier.	Nnali siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo.
I couldn’t believe it	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza
I needed to see someone I knew	Nnali nneetaaga okulaba omuntu gwe mmanyi
I wasn’t quite sure which	Nali sikakasa bulungi ki
We have a job to do.	Tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
I almost didn’t want to	Kumpi nnali saagala
Everyone knows this.	Kino buli omu akimanyi.
You can have him.	Osobola okuba naye.
It was the only thing he could think of doing.	Kye kintu kyokka kye yali asobola okulowooza okukola.
I can do anything you want	Nsobola okukola ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala
I don’t want a relationship with you	Saagala mukwano naawe
He was an only child.	Yali mwana yekka.
Everyone had an opinion.	Buli omu yalina endowooza.
I just thought he needed to know that	Nnalowooza kyokka nti ekyo yali yeetaaga okumanya
But it was difficult.	Naye kyali kizibu.
You can’t tell who he is.	Tosobola kumanya ky’ali.
What's going on.	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
Probably in any situation we should know what to do.	Oboolyawo mu mbeera yonna gye tusaanidde kumanya kya kukola.
Now, of course.	Kati, ddala.
I wanted to talk about my wife	Nnali njagala okwogera ku mukyala wange
I’m not exactly like you	Nze siri nga ggwe ddala
But there is a problem.	Naye waliwo obuzibu.
How are you doing, baby.	Okola otya mwana wange.
I hope this is it	Nsuubira nti kino kye kiri
I might actually be good at that	Mu butuufu nnyinza okuba nga ndi mulungi mu ekyo
But it might just be me.	Naye kiyinza okuba nga nze nzekka.
But we really should move on now.	Naye ddala tusaanidde okugenda mu maaso kati.
It’s just an idea.	Kye kirowoozo kyokka.
I hope that’s true as far as it goes	Nsuubira nti ekyo kituufu okutuuka we kigenda
There they are.	Eyo gye bali.
I’m going to believe my dad.	Ngenda kukkiriza taata wange.
We can say the same thing.	Naffe tusobola okwogera ekintu kye kimu.
I have a very good one	Nnina omulungi ennyo
Not no how.	Si nedda ngeri ki.
In fact, it’s the same for everyone.	Mu butuufu, kye kimu ku buli omu.
You might think it’s not too bad.	Oyinza okulowooza nti si kibi nnyo.
I was so excited	Nnali musanyufu nnyo
He's been her friend and that's all.	Abadde mukwano gwe era ekyo kyokka.
I don’t know what’s going on down there.	Simanyi kigenda mu maaso wansi awo.
I’m going to do so many things.	Ngenda kukola ebintu bingi nnyo.
I knew someone was going to say that	Nali mmanyi nti waliwo agenda okwogera bw’atyo
But he will know.	Naye ajja kumanya.
I wonder what is going on.	Nze nneebuuza ekigenda mu maaso.
And he couldn’t help it.	Era nga tasobola kuyamba.
None of this seems very plausible.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kirabika nga kituufu nnyo.
I knew immediately what it was	Namanya amangu ddala kye kyali
Not with you.	Si naawe.
You want the best person for the job.	Oyagala omuntu asinga ku mulimu.
I think you have a problem	Ndowooza olina ekizibu
From the wedding.	Okuva ku mbaga.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
I wonder why he did it	Nze nneebuuza lwaki yakikola
I can’t say what he wants	Sisobola kwogera ky’ayagala
He doesn’t want money.	Tayagala ssente.
I thought that was all it was.	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyonna kye kyali.
I was his girlfriend	Nze nali muganzi we
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
I couldn’t tell who was on which side	Nnali sisobola kumanya ani yali ku ludda ki
You didn’t know.	Ggwe wali tomanyi.
But now it’s easier.	Naye kati kyangu.
I’m the only one in the room	Nze nzekka mu kisenge
No one can.	Tewali asobola.
I want you to want to spend time with me	Njagala oyagala okumala nange obudde
I hope this goes well.	Nsuubira nti kino kigenda bulungi.
Good.	Kirungi.
I really can’t believe it	Mazima ddala siyinza kukkiriza
Maybe you shouldn’t.	Mpozzi nga tolina kukikola.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
You know what’s going on.	Omanyi ekigenda mu maaso.
You know he did it.	Omanyi nti yakikola.
I know it’s true.	Nkimanyi nti kituufu.
No thoughts about going home.	Tewali kirowoozo kyonna ku kudda eka.
I don’t know why.	Simanyi lwaki.
I thought we could eat earlier	Nalowooza nti tusobola okulya nga bukyali
About a week.	Nga wiiki.
It’s just a moment.	Akaseera katono ddala.
He was terrified.	Yali atya nnyo.
He should have known.	Yandibadde amanyi.
I had no idea what to say	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi kye nnyinza kwogera
And this is very dangerous.	Era kino kya bulabe nnyo.
I was a curious kid	Nnali mwana ayagala nnyo okumanya
It’s not as bad as it sounds.	Si kibi nga bwe kirabika.
Really, really hard.	Ddala, ddala kizibu.
I have to be with him.	Nnina okuba naye.
Not you or anyone else.	Si ggwe oba omuntu omulala yenna.
He is here now.	Ali wano kati.
But he was the only one.	Naye ye yali yekka.
I don’t think this is a good idea	Sirowooza nti kino kirowoozo kirungi
Today is the day.	Leero lwe lunaku.
I am, out of practice	Nze ndi, okuva mu nkola
I know this won’t be easy	Nkimanyi kino tekijja kuba kyangu
That’s what everyone said.	Ekyo buli omu kye yayogera.
Not immediately.	Si mangu ddala.
I had no idea how serious it was	Nnali simanyi ngeri gye kyali kya maanyi
I certainly hope not	Mazima ddala nsuubira nti si bwe kiri
No, this is not true.	Nedda, kino si kituufu.
I know how hard this is	Nkimanyi engeri kino gye kizibu
I didn’t really know	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi
I still couldn’t do it	N’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kukikola
I knew this wouldn’t be good	Namanya nti kino tekijja kuba kirungi
I have nothing bad to say about it	Sirina kibi kye nnyinza kwogera ku nsonga eyo
And you .	Naawe .
I was ready to go.	Nnali mwetegefu okugenda.
He didn’t like it very much.	Yali tayagala nnyo.
And that to me is very important.	Era ekyo gyendi kikulu nnyo.
I was nervous, that’s all	Nali ntya, ekyo kyokka
He actually did it.	Mu butuufu yakikola.
It was really beautiful.	Ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
I could deal with this	Kino nnali nsobola okukola ku nsonga eno
And tonight it was .	Era ekiro kya leero kyali .
I was here for you.	Nze nali wano.
Who knows, at this point.	Ani amanyi, mu kiseera kino.
I can’t wait to try everything!.	Siyinza kulinda kugezaako buli kimu!.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
This is what he expected.	Kino kye yali asuubira.
He's a doctor, you know.	Ye musawo, omanyi.
I just wanted to stay here a little longer	Nnali njagala kumala kusigala wano katono
Here, in the room.	Wano, mu kisenge.
Everyone should read this.	Buli muntu alina okusoma bino.
And that’s what’s happening now.	Era ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso kati.
I’m sure you know how it is.	Nkakasa nti omanyi bwe kiri.
A really good friend	Mukwano omulungi ddala
He couldn’t go home.	Yali tasobola kudda waka.
It would be terrible, you know.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo, omanyi.
He's just a kid.	Ye mwana muto yekka.
Now that would be something!.	Kati ekyo kyandibadde kintu!.
I knew something was up	Namanya nti waliwo ekigenda mu maaso
I knew this wouldn’t be easy.	Namanya nti kino tekijja kuba kyangu.
I want to go with him	Njagala kugenda naye
I guess he was busy.	Ntebereza nti yali bbize.
Not without significant risk.	Si nga tewali bulabe bwa maanyi.
I didn’t have time.	Nnali sirina budde.
Everywhere, doing anything.	Buli wamu, okukola ekintu kyonna.
I know this	Kino nkimanyi
More than himself.	Okusinga ku ye kennyini.
We need to know why.	Tulina okumanya ensonga lwaki.
Very very very very.	Nnyo nnyo nnyo.
I am good at doing my job	Ndi mulungi mu kukola omulimu gwange
It’s not me.	Si nze.
I will always be here.	Nja kubeera wano bulijjo.
That would be something, anyway.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu, mu ngeri yonna.
And yet, there really is only one.	Era naye, ddala waliwo omu yekka.
I want to know why.	Njagala okumanya lwaki.
He doesn’t deserve it.	Tasaanidde.
I like to be busy.	Njagala nnyo okubeera bbize.
You know, he couldn’t do this.	Omanyi kino yali tayinza kukikola.
I just want to make sure you’re happy	Njagala kulaba nga oli musanyufu kyokka
She was that beautiful.	Yali mulungi bw’atyo.
All he had to do.	Byonna bye yalina okukola.
It's bad, my son.	Kibi mwana wange.
He did what he had to do.	Yakola ekyo kye yalina okukola.
That was good at that.	Ekyo yali mulungi mu ekyo.
I wonder how much he actually made	Nze nneebuuza nti ddala yafuna ssente mmeka
It was a matter of when.	Yali nsonga ya ddi.
That’s what it is.	Kye kiri.
I just wanted to be next to you	Nnali njagala kubeera kumpi naawe kyokka
Someone else has to do that.	Omuntu omulala alina okukola ekyo.
You knew he would want to go.	Obadde okimanyi nti ajja kwagala okugenda.
Not that it will be easy.	Si nti kijja kuba kyangu.
That's the whole point.	Eyo y'ensonga yonna.
I don't think that's what you want.	Sirowooza nti ekyo ky'oyagala.
I just need to do it.	Nze nneetaaga kukikola kyokka.
He couldn’t do anything.	Yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
You know you want to.	Omanyi nti oyagala.
But we have to do it.	Naye tulina okukikola.
I can’t be a father right now	Siyinza kubeera taata mu kiseera kino
I don’t know about that kid.	Nze na mwana oyo simanyi.
Or he had been.	Oba yali abadde.
I think that’s a great idea.	Ndowooza ekyo kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
You can't 'know exactly who.	Tosobola 'kumanya ddala ani.
They were a good group, maybe.	Baali kibiina kirungi, mpozzi.
He was in that thought.	Yali mu kirowoozo ekyo.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
He knew he did it.	Yali akimanyi nti yakikola.
I would like to know if that is true	Njagala okumanya oba ekyo kituufu
I wonder if he is okay.	Nze nneebuuza oba ali bulungi.
Not that it was that hard.	Si nti kyali kizibu nnyo.
Anyone could see that.	Ekyo omuntu yenna yali asobola okulaba.
This is very powerful.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo.
I wondered where he could go	Nneebuuza gye yali asobola okugenda
He is still not at home.	N’okutuusa kati tali waka.
I wanted to believe.	Nnali njagala kukkiriza.
That may be the case.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
I don’t want all that stuff near me	Ebintu ebyo byonna saagala kumpi nange
But it is absolutely true.	Naye kituufu ddala.
Not even at the time of course.	Si wadde mu kiseera ekyo ddala.
I can’t even do this right	Kino sisobola na kukikola bulungi
You're going with me.	Ogenda nange.
Now that seems about right.	Kati ekyo kirabika nga kituufu.
I almost thought you were him	Katono ndowooza nti ggwe ye
I could get help now	Nnali nsobola okufuna obuyambi kati
But another one.	Naye omulala.
The house was in excellent condition and very comfortable.	Ennyumba yali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo era nga nnungi nnyo.
How much time he had, he didn’t know.	Obudde bwe yalina, yali tamanyi.
You are very strong now.	Oli wa maanyi nnyo kati.
I don’t want a job.	Saagala mulimu.
Everything looks good.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi.
I knew this was going to be bad	Namanya nti kino kyali kigenda kuba kibi
And then.	Era awo.
We should be back in about an hour.	Tulina okudda mu ssaawa nga emu.
Or he thinks he did.	Oba alowooza nti yakikola.
Now is what matters.	Kati kye kikulu.
Then, he probably did.	Awo, oboolyawo yakikola.
He wanted to know why.	Yali ayagala okumanya lwaki.
I wanted to do the same	Nze nange nnali njagala okukola kye kimu
He was so good at that.	Ekyo yali mulungi nnyo.
I wanted to see what was going on	Nnali njagala kulaba kiki ekigenda mu maaso
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kintu kirungi.
It was just the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu kyokka.
Here it is dangerous.	Wano kya bulabe.
I thought you would know.	Nalowooza nti ojja kumanya.
I know he didn't like it or not.	Nkimanyi yali tayagala oba nga tayagala.
It was like.	Yali nga.
See! 	Okulaba!
I think it will be good	Ndowooza kijja kuba kirungi
The problem is everything.	Obuzibu buli kimu.
No one can know.	Tewali ayinza kumanya.
It’s my time.	Kye kiseera kyange.
I don’t think it is.	Sirowooza nti bwe kiri.
I’m not in that situation	Nze siri mu mbeera eyo
We will do everything together.	Buli kimu tujja kukikola wamu.
I still can’t quite believe this is happening	N’okutuusa kati sisobola bulungi kukkiriza nti kino kigenda mu maaso
You know, it’s really quite simple.	Omanyi ddala kyangu nnyo.
But she looks good.	Naye alabika bulungi.
He was strong still.	Yali wa maanyi akyali.
I didn’t know where he was	Nnali simanyi gye yali
But not here, not in this place.	Naye si wano, si mu kifo kino.
I can't quite tomorrow	Sisobola bulungi enkya
I will know why.	Nja kumanya lwaki.
If he had.	Singa yali...
He must be strong.	Ateekwa okuba nga wa maanyi.
Where was he.	Yali ludda wa.
I loved that about him	Ekyo nnali njagala nnyo ku ye
Why did he feel that way.	Lwaki yawulira bw’atyo.
I knew he would go soon	Nali nkimanyi nti ajja kugenda mangu
I can’t have a relationship with anyone	Sisobola kuba na mukwano na muntu yenna
I couldn’t do it though	Nali sisobola kukikola wadde
That’s not my point.	Ekyo si nsonga yange.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
He said it wasn’t true.	Yagambye nti si kituufu.
I think that’s really great.	Ndowooza ekyo ddala kirungi nnyo.
It was really quite easy to do that.	Mazima ddala kyali kyangu nnyo okukola ekyo.
It’s not a very serious issue.	Si nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
I really live here	Ddala mbeera wano
I’m maybe not ready	Nze mpozzi siri mwetegefu
You will probably want to get a dog.	Oboolyawo ojja kwagala okufuna embwa.
He doesn’t want to preach.	Tayagala kubuulira.
I'll come with you soon	Nja kujja naawe mu bbanga ttono
You will do very well.	Ojja kukola bulungi nnyo.
You have to do it quickly.	Olina okukikola mu bwangu.
Everyone has a phone.	Buli muntu alina essimu.
I am not at home at the moment	Mu kiseera kino siri waka
I don’t care what it is.	Sifaayo ku kiki kye kiri.
I just need to stay alone	Nze nneetaaga kusigala nzekka
Everyone wants to go.	Buli omu ayagala kugenda.
I need to go, be with him	Nze nneetaaga okugenda, okubeera naye
In no way at all.	Mu ngeri yonna n’akatono.
It’s not like it’s every day.	Si nga bwe kiri buli lunaku.
I hope everyone at home is very well	Nsuubira buli muntu awaka ali bulungi nnyo
This is a good point.	Eno nsonga nnungi.
This is the one.	Oyo ye ye.
I wanted to.	Nnali njagala.
I couldn’t see the point of it all	Nnali sisobola kulaba nsonga ya byonna
That continues to this day.	Ekyo kigenda mu maaso n’okutuusa leero.
Where he wanted to go he could not come with her.	Gye yali ayagala okugenda yali tasobola kujja naye.
I am nobody, in that sense	Siri muntu yenna, mu ndowooza eyo
He was going to know.	Ye yali agenda okumanya.
Maybe just one person.	Mpozzi omuntu omu yekka.
Object.	Ekintu.
I feel good about it.	Mpulira bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
He certainly won’t.	Mazima ddala tajja kukikola.
I'm sorry for the hour	Nsonyiwa essaawa
He wasn’t thinking at all.	Yali talowooza n’akatono.
He goes with you.	Agenda naawe.
I knew that would happen.	Nnali nkimanyi nti ekyo kijja kubaawo.
In fact, neither could he.	Mu butuufu, era naye yali tasobola.
Now, though, we have a moment.	Kyokka kati tulina akaseera.
The house is empty.	Ennyumba tewali muntu yenna.
It is very dangerous.	Kya bulabe nnyo.
He is the only child.	Ye mwana omu yekka.
But he seemed okay.	Naye yalabika nga talina buzibu.
I didn’t really know what it was	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kiki
I think everybody did.	Ndowooza buli omu yakikola.
I don’t even know what to say.	Simanyi na kya kwogera.
I want to go to them	Njagala kugenda gye bali
I knew he had slept with her	Namanya nti yali yeebase naye
It’s good to move on.	Kirungi okugenda mu maaso.
I need to do this	Kino nneetaaga okukola
I have only myself.	Nze nnina nze nzekka.
And there was nothing we could do.	Era nga tewali kye twali tusobola kukola.
This was a very important step.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
He has plenty of time.	Alina obudde bungi.
I love this job	Njagala nnyo omulimu guno
But there is one thing.	Naye waliwo ekintu kimu.
I guess that’s okay.	Ntebereza nti ekyo si kibi.
Same with my car.	Kye kimu ne ku mmotoka yange.
He certainly did.	Mazima ddala yakikola.
I guess, doing that	Ntebereza, okukola ekyo
I knew what he wanted.	Nali mmanyi kye yali ayagala.
And he knows that.	Era ekyo akimanyi.
You might get lucky there.	Oyinza okufuna omukisa eyo.
You can talk to him yourself.	Ggwe kennyini osobola okwogera naye.
But that's the point.	Naye eyo y'ensonga.
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
I can’t do that right now	Ekyo sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino
I won’t work with him.	Sijja kukola naye.
It is very dangerous	Kya bulabe nnyo
I’ve been very busy already today	Nze mbadde bbize nnyo dda leero
I still couldn’t see anyone	N’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kulaba muntu yenna
This is a very, very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo nnyo.
I want to find a way	Njagala kufuna ngeri gye nkola
He is very happy to work with her again.	Musanyufu nnyo okuddamu okukola naye.
I can’t do everything.	Sisobola kukola buli kimu.
That is why we are here.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
I probably could have.	Oboolyawo nnali nsobola.
No one should be on this premises.	Tewali alina kubeera ku kifo kino.
But I was the one.	Naye nze nnali.
I could barely work	Nnali sisobola bulungi kukola
I wonder if you already know that	Nze nneebuuza oba ekyo okimanyi dda
I can hardly believe it.	Nze sisobola bulungi kukkiriza.
I knew he would	Nali mmanyi nti ajja kukikola
But now I couldn't do it	Kyokka kati nnali sisobola kukikola
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
I thought it was you	Nalowooza nti ggwe
He was dangerous.	Yali wa bulabe.
I was nervous and scared	Nali ntya era nga ntya
I just wanted to go home	Nnali njagala kudda waka kyokka
My father came more than anyone else.	Taata yajja okusinga omuntu omulala yenna.
This dog is very cute.	Embwa eno nnungi nnyo.
I am absolutely.	Nze ndi ddala.
No, not like him.	Nedda, si nga ye.
I love to read.	Njagala nnyo okusoma.
I knew that would do that	Nali nkimanyi nti ekyo kijja kukola ekyo
That’s not the case with this film.	Ekyo si bwe kiri ku firimu eno.
Of course, this will not work.	Kya lwatu nti kino tekijja kukola.
I don’t know anything.	Sirina kye mmanyi.
He actually did it.	Mu butuufu yakikola.
It is absolutely.	Kiri ddala.
When that would be, he didn't know.	Ekyo ddi lwe kyandibadde, yali tamanyi.
I have no idea what time it is	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ssaawa ki
We can talk there.	Tusobola okwogera eyo.
I loved my wife very much	Nnali njagala nnyo mukyala wange
I'm sure it's much easier though.	Nkakasa nti kyangu nnyo wadde.
This can happen very quickly.	Kino kiyinza okubaawo mu bwangu ddala.
Or a moment.	Oba akaseera.
That was who he was, what he did.	Oyo ye yali ani, kye yakola.
I have no problem with that.	Ekyo sirina buzibu bwonna.
He didn’t have much money.	Yali talina ssente nnyingi.
I didn’t have any money	Nnali sirina ssente yonna
I need to go to work	Nze nneetaaga okugenda ku mulimu
I am nothing	Nze siri kintu
I hope we have no choice	Nsuubira nti tetulina kya kukola
This is your point.	Eno y’ensonga yo.
It’s really easy to do.	Ddala kyangu okukola.
And that’s what we’re going to do today.	Era ekyo kye tugenda okukola leero.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
You will have to move on.	Ojja kuba olina okugenda mu maaso.
But we’ll see.	Naye tujja kulaba.
I could do that	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola
In the meantime he should have stayed at home.	Mu kiseera kino yandibadde abeera waka.
I didn’t know he had it in him.	Nnali simanyi nti alina mu ye.
A little while.	Akaseera katono.
It’s not just a matter of being a good person.	Si nsonga ya kubeera muntu mulungi yekka.
That's where the guy is.	Awo ggaayi w'ali.
I knew my father would come	Nali mmanyi nti taata ajja kujja
If he could be here with you, you know he would.	Singa asobola okubeera wano naawe, omanyi yandibadde.
I can’t do that, you know.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola, omanyi.
It is not the case here.	Si bwe kiri wano.
I knew that was going to happen	Nnali nkimanyi nti ekyo kyali kigenda kubaawo
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
Ready for this.	Mwetegefu ku kino.
No one knew how far he could go.	Tewali yali amanyi we yali asobola okutuuka.
There are these.	Waliwo bino.
I think and feel a lot.	Ndowooza era mpulira nnyo.
It’s harder than it looks.	Kizibu okusinga bwe kirabika.
I was just thinking about you	Nze nali ndowooza ku ggwe kyokka
He loves money.	Ayagala nnyo ssente.
But that was what he needed.	Naye ekyo kye yali yeetaaga.
I hope you might as well	Nsuubira nti oyinza nga bwe kiri
I thought it would be awkward	Nalowooza nti kyandibadde kizibu nnyo
It was a thing of beauty	Kyali kintu kya bulungi
I can’t help in that regard	Siyinza kuyamba mu nsonga eyo
He could have been anyone.	Yali asobola okuba omuntu yenna.
He hoped she would be home.	Yalina essuubi nti ajja kuba awaka.
It may well be the same now.	Kiyinza bulungi okuba nga kye kimu kati.
I didn’t know he had a dog	Nali simanyi nti alina embwa
Or to anyone for that matter.	Oba eri omuntu yenna ku nsonga eyo.
Not everyone did it.	Si buli muntu nti yakikola.
Urban.	Mu kibuga.
I wanted to be a father to you	Nnali njagala kubeera taata gy’oli
I think he should come with me.	Ndowooza yandibadde ajja nange.
When you can’t go back.	Nga tosobola kudda.
I knew that to be true.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi nti kituufu.
I know that in.	Ekyo nkimanyi mu.
Of friends now.	Wa mikwano kati.
I knew something would happen if we went	Nali mmanyi nti waliwo ekigenda okubaawo singa tugenda
We were just there.	Twali awo kyokka.
He was asleep.	Yali yeebase.
I have no idea what it really was	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kituufu kye kyali
He didn’t want to see again.	Yali tayagala kuddamu kulaba.
He is a young child.	Ye mwana muto.
He's like me.	Ye nga nze.
I guess that’s why	Ntebereza nti y’ensonga lwaki
I have something to say	Nnina kye njagala okwogera
The home is not his.	Awaka si wa ye.
I’m going to be a father	Ngenda kubeera taata
More than me.	Okusinga nze.
I could eat something too	Nange nnali nsobola okulya ekintu
We are the only ones.	Ffe ffekka.
But he was powerless.	Naye nga talina maanyi.
I would love to win this	Njagala nnyo okuwangula kino
So much for this.	Bingi nnyo ku kino.
You were there.	Ggwe wali eyo.
I know this is a bad time	Nkimanyi nti kino kiseera kibi
That’s pretty good actually.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo mu butuufu.
That would be really bad.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi ddala.
That was good for me.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
I have to buy things I have to do	Nnina okugula ebintu bye nnina okukola
I need to get my dog ​​though	Nze nneetaaga okufuna embwa yange wadde
I think he’s pretty good	Ndowooza nti mulungi nnyo
You’re way ahead.	Oli mu maaso nnyo.
I can’t wait to drive	Siyinza kulinda kuvuga mmotoka
Or tried to do it.	Oba yagezaako okukikola.
I need to move on	Nze nneetaaga okugenda mu maaso
But now it’s time to go.	Naye kati kye kiseera okugenda.
I could hear the car	Nnali mpulira mmotoka
This is not a good thing.	Kino si kirungi.
He just wanted to be with her.	Yali ayagala kubeera naye yekka.
Anyone could see that	Ekyo omuntu yenna yali asobola okulaba
But he is like that.	Naye ye bw’atyo.
Someone has to do it.	Waliwo alina okukikola.
He wasn’t even at work yet.	Yali tannaba na ku mulimu.
However, on this we have to think again.	Kyokka ku kino tulina okuddamu okulowooza.
I know why he did it.	Nkimanyi lwaki yakola bw’atyo.
We have to get out of here immediately.	Tulina okuva wano amangu ddala.
I was just one man.	Nnali musajja omu yekka.
That was my point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga yange.
I wanted to talk to him	Nnali njagala okwogera naye
In about a day.	Mu nga olunaku.
I wonder why.	Nneebuuza lwaki.
I wonder how he is	Nze nneebuuza nti ali atya
I can’t say who.	Siyinza kwogera ani.
That’s my father.	Oyo ye taata wange.
But tomorrow will come.	Naye enkya ejja kujja.
You’ll see.	Ojja kulaba.
And here it was.	Era wano we kyali.
And that was good.	Era ekyo kyali kirungi.
I knew nothing better than you	Nze nali sirina kye mmanyi okusinga ggwe
He's been here so long.	Abadde wano ebbanga ddene nnyo.
Either way, now nobody has any problems with you.	Mu ngeri yonna, kati tewali alina buzibu bwonna naawe.
I hear he’s in the hospital	Mpulira ali mu ddwaaliro
However, it is not me.	Kyokka si nze.
I didn’t know where but it was close	Nali simanyi wa naye yali kumpi
You can see it coming.	Oyinza okulaba nga kijja.
You can’t do it.	Tosobola kukikola.
I have a clock.	Nnina essaawa.
It must have been him.	Ateekwa okuba nga ye yali ye.
I have to be with him	Nnina okubeera naye
I think it was just beautiful.	Ndowooza nti kyali kirungi kyokka.
There is something everywhere.	Buli wamu waliwo ekintu.
He didn’t think it was true.	Yali talowooza nti kituufu.
I thought he would be here	Nalowooza nti yandibadde wano
I can definitely do that	Ekyo nsobola ddala okukikola
And then he .	Era awo ye .
I hope it isn’t.	Nsuubira nti si bwe kiri.
Who do you think it is.	Ggwe olowooza ani.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Not at all, of course.	Si bwe kiri, ddala.
I have to get to work.	Nnina okutuuka ku mulimu.
But this is what he wanted.	Naye kino kye yali ayagala.
I was ready to get back to work	Nnali mwetegefu okudda ku mulimu
He certainly is.	Mazima ddala ye bw’atyo.
We are lucky.	Tulina omukisa.
I was ready there.	Nnali mwetegefu awo.
I think he's there now.	Ndowooza kati ali awo.
He will be home this weekend.	Agenda kubeera waka wiikendi eno.
There is no reason for us to be there.	Tewali nsonga lwaki tuli awo.
I want more than anything	Njagala okusinga ekintu kyonna
He has a house.	Alina ennyumba.
But someone else did.	Naye waliwo omuntu omulala yakikola.
I don’t want you.	Saagala ggwe.
I can’t say the same	Nze siyinza kwogera kye kimu
I don’t really care	Nze sifaayo nnyo
Everyone is unemployed.	Buli muntu talina mulimu.
I just needed to get	Nnali nneetaaga kufuna kyokka
He won't have to know.	Tajja kuba alina kumanya.
Everything was very, very simple.	Buli kimu kyali kyangu nnyo, kyangu nnyo.
And of course none.	Era ddala tewali.
I was as scared as I could be	Nnali ntya nga bwe nsobola
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okukikola.
It may be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
But he was in trouble.	Naye yali mu buzibu.
And no, no, no.	Era nedda nedda.
That's my point.	Ye nsonga yange.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
He couldn’t.	Yali tasobola.
Tomorrow, he thought.	Enkya, bwe yalowooza.
And maybe.	Era mpozzi.
I just want to talk to you	Njagala kwogera naawe kyokka
He had to go to the hospital.	Yalina okugenda mu ddwaaliro.
I think he’s going to be this week.	Ndowooza wiiki eno agenda kubeera.
He did, barely.	Yakikola, mu buzibu.
And we will drive to get where we need to get.	Era tujja kuvuga okutuuka we twetaaga okutuuka.
Yeah, yeah.	Ye ye.
To get to the bottom.	Okutuuka wansi.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
He could have done it, if he wanted to.	Yali asobola okukikola, singa yali ayagala.
Not with him, not with anyone.	Si naye, si na muntu yenna.
I can’t do it	Sisobola kukikola
Not even overthinking.	Si wadde okulowooza ennyo.
This issue is over.	Ensonga eno ewedde.
I can’t do that	Ekyo sisobola kukikola
I won’t go to the police	Sijja kugenda ku poliisi
I just want to be with me	Njagala kubeera nange kyokka
when he thought that.	bwe yalowooza nti.
He really hoped that wasn’t the case.	Ddala yalina essuubi nti ekyo si bwe kyali.
I can do it tomorrow	Nsobola okukikola enkya
We were both.	Ffembi twali.
No one is happy.	Tewali muntu yenna musanyufu.
And here he is.	Naye oyo ye.
Not the car in front.	Si mmotoka eri mu maaso.
You don’t want to, but you will.	Toyagala, naye ojja kukikola.
Doing this is really important.	Okukola kino kikulu nnyo ddala.
I was supposed to be here	Nze nnali wa kubeera wano
I know, she thought.	Nkimanyi, bwe yalowooza.
Please, you have.	Nsaba, olina.
I live there .	Nze mbeera eyo .
But the way.	Naye engeri.
I think it looks great	Ndowooza kirabika bulungi nnyo
That was all it could be.	Ekyo kyokka kye kyali kiyinza okuba.
I don’t have it and I never will	Sirina era sijja kukikola
I love my dad so much	Njagala nnyo taata wange
I was always at work.	Bulijjo nnali ku mulimu.
I am absolutely happy	Ndi musanyufu ddala
He knew everything.	Yali amanyi buli kimu.
I think he can do whatever he wants	Ndowooza asobola okukola kyonna ky’ayagala
I wonder why they are here	Nze nneebuuza lwaki bali wano
This is what my brother is.	Kino kye kiri muganda wange.
Everywhere.	Buli wamu.
I want to see one	Njagala okulaba emu
It was something in me.	Kyali kintu mu nze.
But it certainly would have been worse.	Naye mazima ddala kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okukikola.
In .	Mu .
This is true for every woman.	Kino kituufu ku buli mukyala.
No, it’s not mine.	Nedda, si wange.
I know this is hard.	Nkimanyi kino kizibu.
It looks serious, but it really isn’t.	Kirabika nga kya maanyi, naye mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
I want to be something	Njagala kubeera kintu
This is not the case here.	Kino si bwe kiri wano.
You’re lucky, actually.	Oli wa mukisa, mu butuufu.
I’m not there right now.	Siri awo mu kiseera kino.
No, no, just a little bit.	Nedda, nedda, katono ddala.
I can see everything	Nsobola okulaba buli kimu
But.	Naye.
I didn’t care about anything at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sifaayo ku kintu kyonna
You love it so much.	Ggwe ayagala nnyo.
He's been here before.	Abadde wano emabegako.
I really hope not	Nsuubira ddala nti si bwe kiri
I think the same thing may be happening now	Ndowooza ekintu kye kimu kiyinza okuba nga kati kigenda mu maaso
I am not a good man	Siri musajja mulungi
There is no reason.	Tewali nsonga.
He has been working.	Abadde akola.
My point is that.	Ensonga yange eri nti.
Now it’s commonplace.	Kati kya bulijjo.
No, you can’t.	Nedda, tosobola.
He was fine though.	Yali bulungi wadde.
And it’s very difficult.	Era kizibu nnyo.
This is certainly true.	Kino mazima ddala kituufu.
I know he will be here	Nkimanyi nti ajja kubeera wano
I want to be home.	Njagala kubeera waka.
I needed to buy time	Nnali nneetaaga okugula obudde
There is no organization.	Tewali kibiina kyonna.
Here is the point.	Wano waliwo ensonga.
He can talk.	Asobola okwogera.
He will surely be good now.	Mazima ddala ajja kuba mulungi kati.
That was, in a way, too bad.	Ekyo mu ngeri emu, kyali kibi nnyo.
There is time.	Waliwo obudde.
He got one.	Yafuna emu.
I think we’ll soon see.	Ndowooza nti mu bbanga ttono tujja kulaba.
He really has to work.	Ddala alina okukola.
I'm glad he's mine.	Ndi musanyufu nti ye wange.
I've had a hard time buying the stuff.	Nze nfunye obuzibu okugula ebintu ebyo.
In fact, he had no choice.	Mu butuufu, yali talina kya kukola.
At the same time.	Mu kiseera kye kimu.
I might work on one of those	Nnyinza okukola ku kimu ku ebyo
I think my friend is in trouble	Ndowooza mukwano gwange ali mu buzibu
This is together.	Kino bali wamu.
Now you have me.	Kati olina nze.
I don’t want to be around him	Saagala kubeera kumpi naye
It is very dangerous.	Kya bulabe nnyo.
What they are.	Kye bali.
He cannot know the truth.	Tasobola kumanya kituufu.
He still doesn’t come.	N’okutuusa kati tajja.
Actually like you, too.	Mu butuufu nga ggwe, naawe.
Not now, not here.	Si kati, si wano.
This may be true.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
I don’t want trouble here	Saagala buzibu wano
But someone does their job.	Naye omuntu akola omulimu gwe.
That is a powerful thing.	Ekyo kintu kya maanyi.
He wants to, you know.	Ayagala, omanyi.
Maybe as soon as this morning.	Mpozzi amangu ddala nga enkya ya leero.
There is nothing to say.	Tewali kya kwogera.
But he knew he couldn’t go back to them.	Naye yali akimanyi nti tayinza kudda gye bali.
Not now, not always.	Si kati, si bulijjo.
He was strong and beautiful.	Yali wa maanyi era nga mulungi.
I wanted to.	Nnali njagala.
The same is true of you.	Kye kimu naawe.
It will be good.	Kijja kuba kirungi.
But that may be easier said than done.	Naye ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
I didn’t know about it	Nnali simanyi ku nsonga eyo
But not really.	Naye si ddala.
I hope you might as well	Nsuubira nti oyinza nga bwe kiri
I hope it doesn’t matter	Nsuubira nti si kikulu
I can’t believe he would do that	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ekyo yandikoze
You’re going to be fine.	Ogenda kuba bulungi.
I thought it might be something I didn’t know	Nalowooza nti kiyinza okuba nga kye simanyi
He couldn't wait until he did.	Yali tasobola kulinda okutuusa lwe yakikola.
I was completely and utterly alone	Nali nzekka ddala era ddala
This is the same for a person.	Kino kye kimu eri omuntu.
But he wanted to.	Naye yali ayagala.
I know you’re there	Nkimanyi nti oli awo
You’ll be fine.	Ojja kuba bulungi.
From here it is easy.	Okuva wano kyangu.
I can do that, right now too	Ekyo nsobola okukikola, mu kiseera kino nange
Why is it something we have to study.	Lwaki kye kintu kye tulina okusoma.
I can’t go back with him	Siyinza kudda naye
Apparently he had a lot.	Kirabika yalina bingi.
I like to think that maybe he was sick	Njagala nnyo okulowooza nti osanga yali mulwadde
He just has it.	Alina kyokka.
Seeing is doing.	Okulaba kuba kukola.
I knew when it was going to hit	Namanya ddi lwe kyali kigenda okukuba
Probably me.	Oboolyawo nze.
But just a little bit.	Naye katono ddala.
I was hoping you would come home soon	Nali nsuubira nti mu bbanga ttono ojja kudda awaka
He was always good to me.	Bulijjo yali mulungi gyendi.
More than he should have.	Okusinga ku bwe yandibadde.
You will do it.	Ojja kukikola.
I knew he wasn’t thinking about me	Namanya nti talowooza ku nze
I just can’t do that	Nze ekyo kyokka sisobola kukikola
We are just like everyone else.	Tuli nga buli muntu omulala yenna.
This is very dangerous.	Kino kya bulabe nnyo.
I had no real idea where	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kya ddala wa
He should have done this.	Kino yandibadde akikola.
It really doesn’t matter.	Mazima ddala si kikulu.
I was afraid of a lot of things	Nali ntya ebintu bingi
I’m sure he did.	Nkakasa nti yakikola.
It wasn’t what he expected.	Si kye yali asuubira.
I already knew it in the past	Nnali nkimanyi dda emabega
It was pretty cool, really.	Kyali kirungi nnyo, ddala.
I could do much better here	Nnali nsobola okukola obulungi ennyo wano
But he was the one.	Naye ye yali.
I can’t have everyone just doing what they want	Siyinza kuba na buli muntu ng’akola kyokka ky’ayagala
That was very nice of them to do.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo gye bali okukola.
Maybe you don’t have one.	Mpozzi nga tolina.
But there is no luck.	Naye tewali mukisa.
And everyone was happy.	Era buli omu yali musanyufu.
But anything can happen on a day like today.	Naye ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo ku lunaku nga leero.
I was feeling nothing of the sort	Nze nali mpulira kintu kyonna kya ngeri eyo
You have no idea what it is.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki.
I think you’ll do well	Ndowooza ojja kukola bulungi
I wonder what he was doing back here	Nze nneebuuza kye yali akola emabega wano
and I still haven’t.	era n’okutuusa kati sigenda.
It was one guy.	Yali ggaayi omu.
He tried to speak.	Yagezaako okwogera.
I couldn’t go much further	Nnali sisobola kugenda mu maaso nnyo
That was always easy.	Ekyo bulijjo kyali kyangu.
And he said he talked to her.	Era n’agamba nti yayogera naye.
He didn’t like where this was going.	Yali tayagala kino gye kyali kigenda.
I certainly can and will.	Nze mazima ddala nsobola era nja kukikola.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
I knew we could do this	Namanya nti kino tusobola okukikola
I'll be down there soon.	Nja kuba wansi awo mu bbanga ttono.
This will never happen again.	Kino tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
I wanted to be an artist	Nnali njagala kubeera muyimbi
I don’t care.	Nze sifaayo.
I think he is speaking the truth	Ndowooza nti ayogera ku mazima
I know it and he knew it	Nze nkimanyi era naye yali akimanyi
I wanted to go home already	Nnali njagala kudda waka dda
I needed to get to the point	Nnali nneetaaga okutuuka ku nsonga
I just wanted to know	Nnali njagala kumanya kyokka
Now he looks better.	Kati alabika bulungi.
I have something you want	Nnina ky’oyagala
One thing at a time.	Ekintu kimu ku kimu.
When he.	Bwe ye...
I guess he had to be	Ntebereza nti yalina okuba bw’atyo
And it’s not just that.	Era si ekyo kyokka.
I can’t do anything wrong	Siyinza kukola kibi kyonna
This was a very serious situation.	Eno yali mbeera ya maanyi nnyo.
I know you will do well baby	Nkimanyi ojja kukola bulungi mwana wange
He isn’t like that.	Si bw’atyo.
Occupation.	Omulimu.
Though not at the moment.	Wadde nga si mu kiseera kino.
I think .	Ndowooza .
He was my father.	Yali taata wange.
I don’t want to go to the hospital	Saagala kugenda mu ddwaaliro
I couldn’t tell where or why	Nali sisobola kumanya wa oba lwaki
Or on the car.	Oba ku mmotoka.
I can talk to him, but he can't talk back	Nsobola okwogera naye naye tasobola kuddamu kwogera
An occupation, occupation or occupation	Omulimu, omulimu oba omulimu
That’s obviously true.	Ekyo kya lwatu kituufu.
I don’t know what to say	Simanyi kya kwogera
I couldn’t believe this was actually happening	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti kino ddala kyali kigenda mu maaso
And it’s so beautiful.	Era nga kirungi nnyo.
Or he thought he did.	Oba yalowooza nti yakikola.
I was working on mine last week.	Nze wiiki ewedde nnali nkola ku yange.
I need help with this	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi ku nsonga eno
My brother not so much.	Muganda wange si nnyo.
I knew exactly where we were	Nnali mmanyi bulungi gye twali
I don’t know what to do	Simanyi kya kukola
I’m not going to do anything about it.	Sigenda kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
I want to see a doctor	Njagala kulaba musawo
This is mine.	Kino kyange.
I can’t talk to anyone about it	Siyinza kwogera na muntu yenna ku nsonga eno
He tried to think.	Yagezaako okulowooza.
We don’t have time to talk about why.	Tetulina budde kwogera ku nsonga lwaki.
I don’t want to know anything	Saagala kumanya kintu kyonna
I want to be home with him	Njagala okubeera awaka naye
He just wasn’t.	Ye yekka si bwe yali.
I wanted to be strong.	Nnali njagala kubeera wa maanyi.
He was so happy to be with her.	Yali musanyufu nnyo okubeera naye.
I will do this immediately.	Kino nja kukikola amangu ddala.
We needed help.	Twali twetaaga obuyambi.
I almost didn’t want to believe what he was saying	Kumpi saagala kukkiriza bye yali ayogera
There is no way you could have done this.	Tewali ngeri gye wandibadde okola kino.
Right now that’s you.	Mu kiseera kino oyo ggwe.
I wonder if you have that	Nze nneebuuza oba ekyo olina
And soon, there is.	Era mu bbanga ttono, waliwo.
He tries to win.	Agezaako okuwangula.
You hear me.	Ggwe mpulira.
I will call again tomorrow at the same time.	Nja kuddamu okukuba essimu enkya mu kiseera kye kimu.
For anything, really.	Ku kintu kyonna, ddala.
He was ordinary.	Yali wa bulijjo.
We cannot accept this fact.	Tetusobola kukkiriza nsonga eno.
I think he tries	Ndowooza agezaako
Please everyone here	Nsaba buli muntu wano
Now he is.	Kati ali.
I have to go right there	Nnina okugenda ddala awo
He was probably talking to her even now.	Oboolyawo yali ayogera naye ne kati.
This was a bit more complicated than he thought.	Kino kyali kizibu katono okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
He is with me.	Ali nange.
It was a bad idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kibi.
Now it really is.	Kati ddala bwe kiri.
In fact, that is not true.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si kituufu.
I thought you were going to do the same	Nalowooza nti naawe ogenda kukola kye kimu
And then he knew.	Era awo n’amanya.
I am ready to move on.	Ndi mwetegefu okugenda mu maaso.
He came here here.	Yajja wano wano.
He would be all we need.	Yandibadde yenna gwe twetaaga.
I hope you find out soon	Nsuubira nti ojja kumanya mu bbanga ttono
He is afraid of dogs too.	Atya embwa naye.
Who knows what will happen.	Ani amanyi ekigenda okubaawo.
Not with you.	Si naawe.
Just like you were.	Nga naawe bwe wali.
I didn’t think he was really good	Nnali sirowooza nti ddala yali mulungi
I really had to get this.	Kino ddala nnali nnina okufuna.
I knew better than that	Nze nnali mmanyi okusinga ekyo
It looks good now.	Kirabika bulungi kati.
I don’t know exactly where it is	Simanyi bulungi gye kiri
It’s not for me to say.	Si kyange okugamba.
But it will come at a critical time.	Naye kijja kujja mu kiseera ekizibu.
There is no problem with that.	Tewali buzibu ku ekyo.
I want .	Njagala .
In my own way.	Mu ngeri yange.
I should speak up.	Nsaanidde okwogera.
He plans to leave soon.	Ateekateeka kugenda mu bbanga ttono.
I still don’t know.	N’okutuusa kati simanyi.
I have a way to do it for you	Nnina engeri gye nnyinza okukikola gy’oli
I had nothing and no one but you	Nali sirina kintu kyonna era tewali muntu yenna okuggyako ggwe
There is your point.	Waliwo ensonga yo.
You know you can do it.	Omanyi nti osobola okukikola.
In one hour.	Mu ssaawa emu.
He will definitely come.	Ajja ddala.
I'm sorry, too.	Nange nsonyiwa.
We are here to help!.	Tuli wano okuyamba!.
I suppose that was my thinking	Nsuubira nti eyo ye yali endowooza yange
I won’t tell anyone.	Sijja kubuulira muntu yenna.
I’m going to be myself	Ngenda kubeera nze kennyini
You love money.	Oyagala nnyo ssente.
But he is a young child.	Naye ye mwana muto.
This is a powerful time.	Kino kiseera kya maanyi.
But it was true.	Naye kyali kituufu.
But he says he won’t come.	Naye agamba nti tajja kujja.
Every woman works.	Buli mukyala akola.
Not for long though.	Si lwa bbanga ddene wadde.
But not for the most part.	Naye si okusinga.
Now, he knew why.	Kati, yali amanyi lwaki.
What is going to happen? 	Kiki ekigenda okubaawo?
It’s up to you, he said.	Kiri gy’oli, bwe yagambye.
I wonder if maybe we can	Nneebuuza oba osanga tusobola
My son is my brother.	Mwana wange muganda wange.
It was just this.	Kyali kino kyokka.
I would love to know your opinion	Njagala nnyo okumanya endowooza yo
I know the day, the hour.	Nze mmanyi olunaku, essaawa.
Much or nothing is wrong.	Bingi oba tewali kibi.
I want to talk to you a bit.	Njagala kwogera naawe katono.
I didn’t think that was possible	Nnali sirowooza nti ekyo kiyinza okubaawo
I couldn’t see what he was doing	Nnali sisobola kulaba kye yali akola
He was always happy.	Bulijjo yali musanyufu.
He knows absolutely everything.	Amanyi ddala buli kimu.
And what a great weekend that was.	Era nga wiikendi eyo yali ya maanyi nnyo.
Up to you.	Kiri eri gwe.
He came to my office.	Yajja mu ofiisi yange.
It’s not a policy.	Si nkola.
Not only that.	Si kyokka nti...
Then we have that.	Awo tulina ekyo.
I can talk to him about anything	Nsobola okwogera naye ku kintu kyonna
In the hospital.	Mu ddwaaliro.
He knows they are there.	Akimanyi nti bali awo.
I wish my dad was here	Njagala nnyo taata yandibadde wano
It was everywhere.	Kyali buli wamu.
He didn’t know who she was.	Yali tamanyi ye ani.
I can do the same!	Nange nsobola okukola kye kimu!
Definitely good for me.	Mazima ddala mulungi gyendi.
I love it, actually	Njagala nnyo, mu butuufu
And he could very well.	Era yali asobola bulungi nnyo.
Here is one reason.	Wano waliwo ensonga emu.
He wants to do it.	Ayagala okukikola.
That’s good for you to do.	Ekyo kirungi gyoli okukola.
This is it, you think.	Kino kye kiri, olowooza.
And so did my father.	Era ne taata bwe yakola.
Soon I was ready to go home	Mu bbanga ttono nnali mwetegefu okudda eka
Not so, today.	Si bwe kiri, leero.
There is probably someone else there as well.	Oboolyawo waliwo omuntu omulala eyo naye.
Not everyone can do that.	Ekyo si buli muntu nti asobola okukikola.
He was now in good shape.	Kati yali mu mbeera nnungi.
He needs to talk and now.	Yeetaaga okwogera era kati.
I have no idea which direction this thing is going.	Sirina kirowoozo ku ludda ki ekintu kino kye kigenda.
And he did it.	Era yakikola.
I need help here.	Nze wano nneetaaga obuyambi.
He was very strong indeed.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo ddala.
I was completely down.	Nali wansi ddala.
That was him.	Oyo ye yali ye.
It’s very, very bad.	Kibi nnyo nnyo.
I wasn’t sure who	Nali sikakasa ani
This is a simple problem.	Kino kizibu kyangu.
I have no idea why he thinks that	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki alowooza bw’atyo
I want to see everything	Njagala okulaba buli kimu
He knows where you are.	Amanyi gyoli.
In this film.	Mu firimu eno.
It was a good night.	Ekiro kyali kirungi.
You know how to be alone.	Omanyi okubeera wekka.
I'm going home.	Ngenda waka.
I think that’s what he wants.	Ndowooza ekyo ky’ayagala.
No, actually, that’s not quite true.	Nedda, mu butuufu, ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
I can imagine living with you	Nsobola okulowooza nti mbeera naawe
I thought about why we were here	Nalowooza ku nsonga lwaki twali wano
But that’s not really the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri ddala.
What he did.	Kye yakola.
He doesn't have it.	Talina.
He’s going to do it.	Agenda kukikola.
That’s exactly what we were.	Ddala bwe twali.
But at a huge cost.	Naye ku ssente nnyingi nnyo.
That’s not all though.	Ekyo si kyokka wadde.
It was a very dangerous situation.	Yali mbeera ya bulabe nnyo.
I really didn’t even know why	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi wadde lwaki
She wants a man.	Ayagala musajja.
I was ready for anything	Nnali mwetegefu okukola ekintu kyonna
You know how that is.	Omanyi engeri ekyo gye kiri.
He hoped to do it soon.	Yalina essuubi nti ajja kukikola amangu.
I thought he was happy	Nalowooza nti yali musanyufu
I was afraid too.	Nange nnali ntya.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
He was always well.	Bulijjo yali bulungi.
He said nothing to me.	Tewali kye yangamba.
I knew he was more than that	Namanya nti yali asinga ekyo
He was a very nice person.	Yali muntu mulungi nnyo.
You don’t have to win.	Tolina kuwangula.
Now he won’t do it.	Kati tajja kukikola.
I am nobody, in that sense.	Siri muntu yenna, mu ndowooza eyo.
I know it very well	Nkimanyi bulungi nnyo
He had been lucky.	Yali abadde wa mukisa.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
I thought you’d like it	Nalowooza nti wandyagadde
My point is, you are young.	Ensonga yange eri nti, oli muto.
That would be it.	Ekyo kyandibadde.
I had no issue with that.	Ekyo nnali sirina nsonga yonna.
Where that can all be.	Ekyo kyonna we kiyinza okuba.
I wondered why.	Nnali nneebuuza lwaki.
I wasn’t even sure why	Nnali sikakasa wadde lwaki
I was very good indeed	Nali mulungi nnyo ddala
Today, however, he needed time to think.	Kyokka leero yali yeetaaga obudde okulowooza.
It’s all a matter of opinion.	Byonna nsonga ya ndowooza.
And that’s what it was.	Era ekyo kye kyali.
This, of course, is the whole point.	Eno, ddala, y’ensonga yonna.
I know what it is like.	Nze mmanyi bwe kiri.
She looked good, she thought.	Yalabika bulungi, bwe yalowooza.
I have no idea what of.	Sirina kirowoozo ku kiki kya.
I might just go home	Nnyinza okumala okudda eka
I really couldn’t do it without help.	Mazima ddala nnali sisobola kukikola nga sirina buyambi.
In this case it was a house.	Mu mbeera eno yali nnyumba.
It would be nice	Kyandibadde kirungi
It’s a problem isn’t it.	Kizibu si bwe kiri.
The problem is real.	Obuzibu bwa ddala.
I couldn’t even see anything	Nnali sisobola na kulaba kintu kyonna
I think he was doing the same	Ndowooza naye yali akola kye kimu
I was happy with him	Nali musanyufu naye
He could win that way.	Yali asobola okuwangula mu ngeri eyo.
He had been lucky.	Yali abadde wa mukisa.
There is power in that.	Mu ekyo mulimu amaanyi.
I, too, am young as yet.	Nze, nange, ndi muto nga n’okutuusa kati.
I wanted what he wanted	Nnali njagala kye yali ayagala
I wasn’t sure if he wanted to talk to me	Nali sikakasa oba yali ayagala kwogera nange
He was happy doing that.	Yali musanyufu ng’akola ekyo.
It was a serious problem.	Kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I just wanted to go	Nnali njagala kugenda kyokka
As it was the case.	Nga bwe kyali.
I could do this.	Kino nnali nsobola okukikola.
But he will do it.	Naye ajja kukikola.
I am a good man.	Ndi musajja mulungi.
But this is a real opportunity for you.	Naye guno mukisa gwa ddala gy’oli.
This was a good idea.	Kino kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
It might just work.	Kiyinza okumala okukola.
I felt so young.	Nnali mpulira nga ndi muto nnyo.
You can do whatever you want.	Osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
I have no idea where they are, or whether, they are	Sirina kye mmanyi gye bali, oba oba, gye bali
Of course, he was young at the time.	Kya lwatu nti mu kiseera ekyo yali muto.
That’s not time at all, that’s nothing.	Ekyo si kiseera n’akatono, ekyo si kintu kyonna.
This is really easy to do.	Kino ddala kyangu okukola.
I knew that at the time	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi mu kiseera ekyo
I didn’t know what to do	Nnali simanyi kya kukola
How wonderful to be human.	Nga kirungi nnyo okubeera omuntu.
But certainly not all.	Naye mazima ddala si byonna.
I don’t know if he knew this.	Simanyi oba kino yali akimanyi.
But that’s not the point.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga.
I wanted to do things right	Nnali njagala okukola ebintu obulungi
It’s definitely not just one thing.	Mazima ddala si kintu kimu kyokka.
I can’t believe it’s you	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ggwe
I hope that is enough knowledge	Nsuubira nti ekyo kumanya kumala
He is a man now.	Ye musajja kati.
He was reluctant to talk to police at this time.	Yali tayagala nnyo kwogera na poliisi mu kiseera kino.
You are like my brother.	Oli nga muganda wange.
Probably not a good thing.	Oboolyawo si kintu kirungi.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
Probably more than that.	Oboolyawo okusinga ekyo.
And so did he.	Era naye bwe yakola.
He'll be fine, of course.	Ajja kuba bulungi, ddala.
In this position.	Mu kifo kino.
It needed to be right.	Yali yeetaaga okuba nga kituufu.
I can’t tell anyone but you	Siyinza kubuulira muntu yenna okuggyako ggwe
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
Nothing is the same now.	Tewali kye kimu kati.
But this is my father’s house, he thought.	Naye eno nnyumba ya taata, bwe yalowooza.
My father had a car.	Taata yalina mmotoka.
I want to talk about you.	Njagala kwogera ku ggwe.
I am so lucky to have you	Ndi wa mukisa nnyo okubeera naawe
A lot like you, actually	Bingi nga ggwe, mu butuufu
I am ready to move on	Ndi mwetegefu okugenda mu maaso
That’s great for me.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo gyendi.
I have absolutely no idea	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna n’akatono
I am in any way.	Nze mu ngeri yonna.
He goes on all night.	Agenda mu maaso ekiro kyonna.
I just want to see my brother happy	Njagala kulaba muganda wange nga musanyufu kyokka
His wife is also all long ago.	Mukyala we naye byonna dda nnyo emabega.
I really need help.	Nneetaaga nnyo obuyambi.
You won’t win.	Tojja kuwangula.
He knew what it was on the face.	Yali amanyi kye kyali ku maaso.
I was always happy, always	Bulijjo nnali musanyufu, bulijjo
Now that’s just bad.	Kati ekyo kibi kyokka.
I was too young when everything was going on	Nnali muto nnyo nga buli kimu kigenda mu maaso
And you know it.	Era ggwe okimanyi.
No one knew where to go.	Tewali yali amanyi wa kugenda.
This may be the case.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
That’s neither here nor there right now.	Ekyo si wano wadde awo mu kiseera kino.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
That won’t help.	Ekyo tekijja kuyamba.
We are absolutely fine.	Tuli bulungi ddala.
And to me, too.	Era ne gyendi.
And he still does it.	Era n’okutuusa kati akikola.
I know you would rather be with him than with me	Nkimanyi nti wandyagadde okubeera naye okusinga nze
Not in any way.	Si ngeri yonna.
I just know it’s not true.	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti si kituufu.
I love both of them.	Njagala nnyo bombi.
But not for long.	Naye si lwa bbanga ddene.
I have no help, nothing	Sirina buyambi, sirina kintu kyonna
No, not a little bit.	Nedda, si katono.
I don’t know what they are	Simanyi kye bali
I need to talk to you for a while.	Nze nneetaaga kwogera naawe okumala akaseera.
He is very young.	Muto nnyo.
He thinks he’s in trouble.	Alowooza nti alina obuzibu.
He had nothing to do.	Yali talina kya kukola.
Though he knew he would.	Wadde yali akimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
I hear he was a friend of his wife	Mpulira yali mukwano gwa mukyala we
It’s not as bad as it sounds.	Si kibi nga bwe kirabika.
I couldn’t go.	Nnali sisobola kugenda.
I won’t go on.	Sijja kugenda mu maaso.
I want to find my friend.	Njagala kufuna mukwano gwange.
You know that’s not true.	Omanyi ekyo si kituufu.
That was me.	Oyo nnali nze.
I need the police.	Nze nneetaaga poliisi.
I think this is a good place to be	Ndowooza kino kifo kirungi okubeera
You can't be.	Tosobola kuba.
And he was very good.	Era yali mulungi nnyo.
Maybe he's just fine.	Mpozzi nga ali bulungi kyokka.
No one can really help.	Tewali asobola ddala kuyamba.
He had time for everyone.	Yalina obudde bwa buli muntu.
I’ll do whatever you want.	Nja kukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
He has.	Alina.
He was a friend of my father’s.	Yali mukwano gwa taata.
That’s what I do.	Ekyo kye nkola.
This goes away very quickly.	Kino kigenda mangu ddala.
I know you would love it	Nkimanyi nti wandyagadde nnyo
You have no idea.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna.
However, I was pretty good at this	Kyokka kino nnali mulungi nnyo mu kino
I really have no idea why he does this	Mazima ddala sirina kye mmanyi lwaki akola kino
He seems to be in pretty good shape.	Kirabika ali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
I wonder who it is.	Nze nneebuuza ani.
And no, this isn’t partisan.	Era nedda, kino si kya kibiina.
I want to do it again.	Njagala kuddamu kukikola.
I don’t want to do it again.	Saagala kuddamu kukikola.
I don’t have anything on him yet.	Nze n’okutuusa kati sirina kintu kyonna ku ye.
He didn’t want anything.	Yali talina ky’ayagala.
He is a good man.	Musajja mulungi.
He wants to spend time with her.	Ayagala okumala naye obudde.
It could be you.	Kiyinza okuba nga ggwe.
I think he could do it	Ndowooza yali asobola okukikola
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
I will definitely be back	Mazima ddala nja kudda
My wife.	Mukyala wange.
I said that was fine with me.	Nagamba nti ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
I have to think.	Nnina okulowooza.
I thought he was still in the hospital	Nalowooza nti yali akyali mu ddwaaliro
He looked very happy.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo.
But not really.	Naye si ddala.
I know nothing about him.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
My wife will be home soon.	Mukyala wange ajja kudda awaka mu bbanga ttono.
It was a very powerful moment for me.	Kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo gyendi.
I want to believe, though	Njagala kukkiriza, naye
I want to know why	Njagala kumanya lwaki
I need to talk to him	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye
I don’t care to talk to you	Sifaayo kwogera naawe
I have to deal with money.	Nnina okukola ku ssente.
If you knew, you can’t do it.	Singa wali okimanyi, tosobola kukikola.
I had no reason to be afraid.	Nnali sirina nsonga lwaki ntya.
Certainly here and there.	Mazima wano ne wali.
It is a system, and it is a good system.	Ye nkola, era nkola nnungi.
I on my own.	Nze ku nze kennyini.
From you’re the one.	Okuva gy’oli.
Something is going to happen.	Waliwo ekigenda okubaawo.
But that wasn’t the only issue.	Naye ekyo si kye kyokka kye kyali ensonga.
We can see so much.	Tusobola okulaba bingi nnyo.
You don’t know where you are.	Tomanyi gyoli.
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okukikola.
I have to get out of here	Nnina okuva wano
I want to do this with him	Kino njagala kukikola naye
He was a good man.	Yali musajja mulungi.
And it seems very complicated.	Era kirabika nga kizibu nnyo.
I think you’re ready	Ndowooza oli mwetegefu
For one night.	Okumala ekiro kimu.
I was so happy to be home	Nnali musanyufu nnyo okuba awaka
I am not with anyone.	Siri na muntu yenna.
I wanted to be that.	Nnali njagala kubeera ekyo.
In fact, it’s all one place.	Mu butuufu, byonna kifo kimu.
But he told me, no.	Naye yang’amba nti, nedda.
I almost wish it was	Kumpi njagala nga bwe kyali
Everything was on point and accurate and that was it.	Buli kimu kyali ku nsonga era nga kituufu era ekyo kye kyali.
To this day, no one knows exactly why.	N’okutuusa leero, tewali amanyi bulungi nsonga lwaki.
I’m afraid it’s up to you	Ntya nti kiri gy’oli
Which is actually not the case.	Ekintu mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
I could go on for a while.	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu maaso okumala akaseera.
She loves dogs and that’s why she applied for the job.	Ayagala nnyo embwa era y’ensonga lwaki yasaba omulimu guno.
I was to go with him.	Nze nnali wa kugenda naye.
That way, it’s not dangerous.	Mu ngeri eyo, si kya bulabe.
You have me.	Olina nze.
No, not at work.	Nedda, si ku mulimu.
I just love it so much	Nze njagala nnyo kyokka
I hope this continues every week	Nsuubira nti kino kigenda mu maaso buli wiiki
I think he might be my dad	Ndowooza ayinza okuba nga ye taata wange
He is often here.	Atera okuba wano.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
I’m sure it was him	Nkakasa nti ye yali ye
I wanted to say that for a very long time	Ekyo nnali njagala okwogera okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo
This was a terrible thing.	Kino kyali kibi nnyo.
That was exactly what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali ddala.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
This was a very important step.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
I think he wants to do the right thing	Ndowooza ayagala kukola kituufu
Right, that’s what he needed.	Kituufu, ekyo kye yali yeetaaga.
I don’t think it is.	Sirowooza nti bwe kiri.
I loved that dog.	Embwa eyo nnali njagala nnyo.
in.	mu.
I need to go to the police	Nze nneetaaga okugenda ku poliisi
This is what is happening here.	Kino kye kiri wano.
We cannot know.	Tetusobola kumanya.
I didn’t have a good answer	Nnali sirina kya kuddamu kirungi
I think.	Ndowooza.
I could do nothing but watch	Nali sirina kye nsobola kukola okuggyako okulaba
No problems so far.	Tewali buzibu okutuusa kati.
I hope you will not agree to continue	Nsuubira nti tojja kukkiriza kugenda mu maaso
This is a good thing	Kino kintu kirungi
I didn’t want to play	Nnali saagala kuzannya
I knew he would be	Nali mmanyi nti yandibadde
Good job, everyone.	Omulimu mulungi, buli omu.
I always loved it	Bulijjo nnali njagala nnyo
Just helping someone else.	Okuyamba omuntu omulala yekka.
He could get away with doing anything.	Yali asobola okuva mu kukola ekintu kyonna.
I think those are good ideas	Ndowooza ebyo ndowooza nnungi
He does very well, though.	Akola bulungi nnyo, wadde.
He'd still be with her if.	Yandibadde akyali naye singa...
Not really mine.	Si yange ddala.
I know you can do anything	Nkimanyi nti osobola okukola ekintu kyonna
I know very well.	Nze mmanyi bulungi nnyo.
I was more nervous than I had ever been	Nnali ntya nnyo okusinga bwe nnali nfunye
I always loved the way she looked	Bulijjo nnali njagala nnyo engeri gye yali alabika
It is not an ideological view.	Si ndowooza ya ndowooza.
I want a little time alone with you	Njagala akaseera katono nga ndi nzekka naawe
But who could that person be?.	Naye omuntu oyo yandiba ani?.
I'm not quite sure how long.	Sikakasa bulungi bbanga ki.
I don’t care if you do or not.	Sifaayo oba okola oba nedda.
That's the same thing.	Ekyo ekintu kye kimu.
Not as a group.	Si nga kibiina.
He goes away reluctantly.	Agenda nga tayagala.
But you move on.	Naye ggwe ogenda mu maaso.
Night comes, fast and hard.	Ekiro kijja, kyangu era nga kizibu.
He might have been talking to me.	Ayinza okuba nga yali ayogera nange.
I suppose we must have	Nsuubira nti tulina okuba nga tulina
That was really good.	Ekyo kyali kirungi ddala.
He was very good indeed.	Yali mulungi nnyo ddala.
I am more than happy to help	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okuyamba
It’s not a person.	Si muntu.
I can do this, he thought	Kino nsobola okukikola, bwe yalowooza
It’s not about anything good.	Si ku kintu kyonna kirungi.
I think it is.	Ndowooza bwe kiri.
Actually, this is not the case.	Mu butuufu, kino si bwe kiri.
But he had everything.	Naye yalina buli kimu.
In theory, we are moving forward.	Mu ndowooza, tugenda mu maaso.
I wanted to know anything about him	Nnali njagala kumanya kintu kyonna ku ye
I wasn’t ready and he knew that	Nze nali siri mwetegefu era ekyo yali akimanyi
This is not true, that is not true.	Kino si kituufu, ekyo si kituufu.
He was already in trouble.	Yali yafuna dda obuzibu.
Here we are.	Wano we tuli.
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
I am happy to be here.	Ndi musanyufu okubeera wano.
I know now and what.	Nze mmanyi kati ne kiki.
But at this point it was his hometown.	Naye mu kiseera kino kyali kibuga kye.
I just want to know what’s going on	Njagala kumanya kigenda mu maaso kyokka
I want to be a normal kid	Njagala kubeera mwana wa bulijjo
He is a true gay man.	Ye muganzi wa ddala.
But you can’t.	Naye tosobola.
You can do it.	Osobola okukikola.
I’m willing to do anything	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola ekintu kyonna
Indeed.	Ddala ddala.
Everyone is doing things young here.	Buli muntu akola ebintu nga muto wano.
We’ll just have to see.	Tujja kumala kulaba.
You are really beautiful.	Ddala oli mulungi nnyo.
He needed to know what it was.	Yali yeetaaga okumanya kye kyali.
It was something he needed.	Kyali kintu kye yali yeetaaga.
In fact, no problem at all.	Mu butuufu, tewali buzibu n’akatono.
I needed to get to my car	Nnali nneetaaga okutuuka ku mmotoka yange
I was here alone	Nali wano nzekka
We need to know.	Tulina okumanya.
And so he was.	Era bw’atyo bwe yali.
This was a good practice.	Eno yali nkola nnungi.
I know you have to go back to work	Nkimanyi nti olina okudda ku mulimu
And it was really bad.	Era kyali kibi ddala.
He works in my place.	Akola mu kifo kyange.
I won’t go back to school now.	Sijja kudda mu ssomero kati.
He built his cars for a very long time.	Yakola mmotoka ze okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
There is no one here to see.	Tewali muntu yenna wano kulaba.
He wanted one.	Yali ayagala emu.
He was my everything.	Yali buli kimu kyange.
That's not the point right now.	Eyo si y'ensonga mu kiseera kino.
I was with my wife	Nali ne mukyala wange
But not right now.	Naye si mu kiseera kino.
I was afraid to be alone at night	Nnali ntya okubeera nzekka ekiro
He was a human being.	Yali muntu.
I will do that this afternoon.	Ekyo nja kukikola akawungeezi ka leero.
I’m a young man.	Nze ndi muto.
I really wasn’t sure	Mazima ddala nnali sikakasa
I feel good, but it's not me.	Mpulira bulungi naye si nze.
I have things to do here	Nnina ebintu bye nkola wano
I couldn’t be strong	Nnali sisobola kuba wa maanyi
It's everyone in that movie.	Ye buli muntu mu firimu eyo.
I want the same thing	Nze njagala ekintu kye kimu
Everyone was still busy.	Buli omu yali akyali bbize.
I’m not the same yet.	Nze n’okutuusa kati si bwe kiri.
This was very good in this regard.	Kino yali mulungi nnyo mu nsonga eno.
I am not a medical doctor.	Siri musawo musawo.
I said you can do whatever you want	Nagamba nti osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala
I couldn’t believe it when she told me.	Nali siyinza kukkiriza bwe yang’amba.
I could do that.	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola.
I didn’t know he was here.	Nnali simanyi nti yali wano.
I was feeling a little sick	Nali mpulira nga ndi mulwadde katono
I know this isn’t everything	Nkimanyi kino si buli kimu
Maybe that’s why he did it.	Mpozzi y’ensonga lwaki yakikola.
I thought that was it	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kye kyali
Now we are very close.	Kati tuli kumpi nnyo.
I guess this is a form of that	Ntebereza nti eno ngeri ya ekyo
I have a picture, that's it	Nnina ekifaananyi, ekyo kye kiri
. . . .	.
I could barely speak	Nnali sisobola bulungi kwogera
There is so much food.	Emmere nnyingi nnyo.
I hope there are no problems	Nsuubira nti tewali buzibu bwonna
It’s really important.	Ddala kikulu nnyo.
I wasn’t ready for them	Nze nali siri mwetegefu gye bali
However, it was a challenge.	Kyokka, kyali kizibu.
I won’t be around for long	Sijja kubeerawo okumala bbanga ddene
I knew immediately it was a man	Namanya amangu ddala nti yali musajja
I need time to process this	Kino nneetaaga obudde okukola ku nsonga eno
I don’t want to be here	Saagala kubeera wano
I was just a singer	Nnali muyimbi yekka
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
But he was trying.	Naye yali agezaako.
He said that could be the problem.	Yagambye nti ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kye kizibu.
I know you will do well	Nkimanyi nti ojja kukola bulungi
Maybe they are.	Mpozzi nga bwe bali.
I wanted to stay here	Nnali njagala kusigala wano
He is stronger than any of us.	Asinga amaanyi ku ffe yenna.
I need to talk to him.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye.
That’s the point.	Eyo y’ensonga.
It’s not what we are.	Si kye tuli.
I can’t wait to buy again	Siyinza kulinda kuddamu kugula
I know a lot when I’m home.	Nkimanyi bingi nga ndi waka.
He had to think for a moment.	Yalina okulowooza akaseera katono.
Knowing that he can do anything.	Okumanya nti asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
No one knew anything.	Tewali yali amanyi kintu kyonna.
I hope the same for you.	Nsuubira kye kimu ku ggwe.
I was in school, of course.	Nali mu ssomero, ddala.
Not all the time, of course.	Si kiseera kyonna, ddala.
You really shouldn’t.	Ddala tolina kukikola.
I wonder what it was	Nze nneebuuza nti kyali ki
I won’t go home.	Sijja kudda waka.
So far he's been very strong.	N'okutuusa kati abadde wa maanyi nnyo.
I am afraid of myself.	Nze ntya nzekka.
I just hope no one comes	Nsuubira kyokka nti tewali ajja
There is nothing to see here either.	Na wano tewali kya kulaba.
I thought of my father	Nalowooza ku taata
We have to be here.	Tulina okubeera wano.
And this is a problem.	Era kino kizibu.
I couldn’t see myself doing that	Ekyo nnali sisobola kulaba nga nkola
I guess that’s a good answer.	Ntebereza nti ekyo kya kuddamu kirungi.
He must have been like that.	Ateekwa okuba nga bwe yali.
I knew what it could be	Nnali mmanyi kye kiyinza okuba
Much worse than my father.	Kibi nnyo okusinga taata.
But it’s good.	Naye kirungi.
No, definitely not.	Nedda, mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
I needed to know what he was saying	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya kye yali ayogera
I have the power.	Nnina amaanyi.
He was nobody.	Yali si muntu yenna.
Is that right?.	Ekyo kituufu?.
I knew where he lived	Nali mmanyi gye yali abeera
Which goes to my point.	Ekigenda ku nsonga yange.
He wasn't supposed to be with her.	Yali talina kubeera naye.
Maybe that will help.	Mpozzi ekyo kijja kuyamba.
I had no idea.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
He has the power.	Alina amaanyi.
And it was pretty cool.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo.
And that’s not an easy place.	Era ekyo si kifo kyangu.
I wasn’t going to go	Nze nali sigenda kugenda
I'm glad he was here.	Ndi musanyufu nti yali wano.
We can’t do this.	Kino tetusobola kukikola.
I almost can’t believe it	Kumpi sisobola kukkiriza
Maybe an hour.	Mpozzi essaawa emu.
Perhaps that is the reason.	Oboolyawo eyo y’ensonga lwaki.
I’ve got a job.	Nfunye omulimu.
I am now very curious	Nze kati njagala nnyo okumanya
and.	ne.
For me, that wasn’t the case.	Nze ekyo si bwe kyali.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
I knew what he was going to do	Nali mmanyi kye yali agenda okukola
I am not a serious problem	Siri buzibu bwa maanyi
I go to my office	Ngenda mu ofiisi yange
This, is not love by any means.	Kino, si kwagala mu ngeri yonna.
I hope everything goes well	Nsuubira nti buli kimu kigenda bulungi
We just have to work.	Tulina kumala kukola.
I should have seen like you.	Nnali nsaanidde okulaba nga ggwe.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
You know it and I know it.	Ggwe okimanyi era nange nkimanyi.
I know better than that	Nze mmanyi okusinga ekyo
He went home with her.	Yagenda naye awaka.
And I wanted to spend the day with you	Era nnali njagala okumala naawe olunaku
I do almost nothing	Kumpi sirina kye nkola
I knew this wouldn’t be easy.	Namanya nti kino tekijja kuba kyangu.
I had no idea why this was happening	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga lwaki kino kyali kigenda mu maaso
You can get your house back.	Osobola okuddamu ennyumba yo.
I want to be ready	Njagala kubeera mwetegefu
It is the process.	Ye nkola.
I have no luck at all	Sirina mukisa n’akatono
I really had no choice	Mazima ddala nnali sirina kya kukola
I thought there was only one.	Nalowooza nti waliwo omu yekka.
It will certainly work.	Mazima ddala kijja kukola.
He will be there and that is what matters.	Ajja kubeerawo era ekyo kye kikulu.
And it went on and on.	Era ne kugenda mu maaso.
I’m going to do everything right.	Ngenda kukola buli kimu bulungi.
You are a human being	Oli muntu .
I was really fine	Ddala nnali bulungi
I want nothing in return.	Saagala kintu kyonna mu kuddamu.
I didn’t know the reason at the time	Nnali simanyi nsonga mu kiseera ekyo
I couldn’t see the ceiling	Nnali sisobola kulaba ku kisenge
Neither you nor I.	Nedda nze naawe.
I can’t do anything about this	Kino sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
He talks and talks and talks.	Ayogera era ayogera era ayogera.
I was alone, doing nothing	Nali nzekka, nga sirina kye nkola
I thought he was a kid too	Nange nnalowooza nti yali mwana muto
Probably none though.	Oboolyawo tewali wadde.
I know what that is now	Nkimanyi ekyo kye kiri kati
He had been everything for so long.	Buli kimu yali amaze ebbanga ddene nnyo.
I knew you would be good	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kuba mulungi
I think he was so happy to get home.	Ndowooza yali musanyufu nnyo okutuuka awaka.
I couldn’t talk about anything	Nnali sisobola kwogera ku kintu kyonna
I have to live with myself.	Nnina okubeera nange.
You have no idea what that is like.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna ku ngeri ekyo gye kiri.
It won’t be for long.	Tekijja kuba kya bbanga ddene.
Just about everything.	Kumpi buli kimu kyokka.
I really knew nothing about it	Ddala nnali simanyi kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo
I know this isn’t easy for you either.	Nkimanyi kino naawe si kyangu gy’oli.
This seems very serious.	Kino kirabika nga kya maanyi nnyo.
I was the one who was working.	Nze nnali nkola.
What a beautiful experience it was.	Nga kyali kirungi nnyo.
I know how strong you are	Nze mmanyi engeri gy’oli wa maanyi
You love it so much.	Ggwe oyagala nnyo.
I didn’t know you were there	Nnali simanyi nti oli awo
I am pretty good at this actually	Ndi mulungi nnyo mu kino mu butuufu
You think you are.	Ggwe olowooza nti oli.
Who was like that.	Ani yali bw’atyo.
I was sick man, really sick	Nali mulwadde musajja, ddala mulwadde
There are many reasons.	Ensonga nnyingi.
We have to work hard now	Tulina okukola ennyo kati
I won’t be here much longer	Sijja kuddamu kubeera wano nnyo
I was so scared	Nze nnali ntya nnyo
I can’t do that right now	Ekyo sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino
But maybe.	Naye mpozzi.
But to him.	Naye eri ye.
And, of course, it’s a great thing to do.	Era, ddala, kintu kikulu nnyo okukola.
But, we will stay here.	Naye, tujja kusigala wano.
I knew somehow that it wouldn’t be easy	Nali mmanyi mu ngeri emu nti tekijja kuba kyangu
I had no time to do anything.	Nnali sirina budde bwa kukola kintu kyonna.
He would have been there.	Yandibadde awo.
He makes a move.	Akola ekintu ekigenda mu maaso.
I just couldn’t.	Nze nnali sisobola kyokka.
This way, you move forward.	Mu ngeri eno, ogenda mu maaso.
It was a conscious process.	Yali nkola ya kumanya.
This early in the morning.	Kino ku makya ennyo.
Actually this is not true.	Mu butuufu kino si kituufu.
In this case, you are ready to go.	Mu mbeera eno, oli mwetegefu okugenda.
I didn’t know what was going to happen.	Nnali simanyi kyali kigenda kubaawo.
I said that would be fine.	Nagamba nti ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
Nor any one person.	Wadde omuntu yenna omu.
Saying things, maybe.	Okwogera ebintu, mpozzi.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
He is not like you.	Ye si nga ggwe.
It’s just really good.	Kirungi ddala kyokka.
I will do it again	Nja kuddamu okukikola
I feel like I have this right now	Mpulira nga nnina kino mu kiseera kino
I don’t expect anything.	Tewali kye nsuubira.
No, there is no problem.	Nedda, tewali buzibu bwonna.
It was his favorite place.	Kyali kifo kye yali ayagala ennyo.
It will be able to talk to you.	Kijja kusobola okwogera naawe.
I need to talk to you face to face	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe maaso ku maaso
This was excellent.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
But he did the same thing.	Naye naye yakola ekintu kye kimu.
It was dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe.
He can't have.	Tasobola kuba na.
I can talk about that now.	Ekyo nsobola okwogera ku nsonga eno kati.
It looks pretty good.	Kirabika kirungi nnyo.
It is very close.	Kiri kumpi nnyo.
We have to do well.	Tulina okukola obulungi.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
In any way whatsoever	Mu ngeri yonna yonna
That is a very good thing.	Ekyo kintu kirungi nnyo.
Night was coming on.	Ekiro kyali kigenda okutuuka.
And where.	Era wa.
But that’s not why.	Naye si y’ensonga lwaki.
I can’t work at school	Sisobola kukola ku ssomero
I can’t believe you’re here.	Siyinza kukkiriza nti oli wano.
I knew he was my father.	Namanya nti ye taata wange.
I said that was fine	Nagamba nti ekyo kyali kirungi
I really must be in trouble	Ddala nnina okuba nga ndi mu buzibu
And it probably was.	Era oboolyawo bwe kyali.
I’m lucky, everyone has a job	Nnina omukisa, buli muntu alina omulimu
Or maybe every day.	Oba mpozzi buli lunaku.
I can do this, my child.	Kino nsobola okukikola mwana wange.
I thought that was good	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi
He did that very well.	Ekyo yakikola bulungi nnyo.
I can’t go home again	Sisobola kuddamu kudda waka
I want to know.	Njagala okumanya.
However, I didn’t care	Kyokka nnali sifaayo
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
I’m not entirely sure if that’s a good thing or not.	Sikakasa ddala oba ekyo kintu kirungi oba nedda.
No, let me.	Nedda, ka nze.
I think that’s everything, so far	Ndowooza ekyo buli kimu, okutuusa kati
I wasn’t sure how long.	Nali sikakasa bbanga ki.
You are mine and mine alone.	Oli wange era wange nzekka.
Now they were on his side.	Kati baali ku ludda lwe.
I’ve always loved it	Bulijjo mbadde njagala nnyo
That it was real.	Nti kyali kya ddala.
Not so with you.	Si bwe kiri ku ggwe.
I expected that, though.	Kyokka ekyo nnali nsuubira.
Nothing really to say.	Tewali kintu kyonna ddala kya kwogera.
Maybe he actually thought he did.	Mpozzi mu butuufu yalowooza nti yakikola.
He said it wasn’t true.	Yagambye nti si kituufu.
In a sense, it is his job.	Mu ngeri emu, gwe mulimu gwe.
Really for the money.	Ddala ku ssente.
We can do that.	Ekyo tusobola okukikola.
Not even with this one.	Si bwe kiri ne ku kino.
We’ll go, you and I.	Tujja kugenda, nze naawe.
This will work.	Kino kijja kukola.
I wanted to be with him	Nnali njagala kubeera naye
It wasn’t the case.	Si bwe kyali.
And really, it’s not that hard.	Era ddala, si kizibu nnyo.
I wanted to see everything	Nnali njagala okulaba buli kimu
I’m sorry about that.	Nsonyiwa ku nsonga eyo.
It seems simpler that way.	Kirabika nga kyangu mu ngeri eyo.
I can’t believe no one wants to buy this	Siyinza kukkiriza nti tewali ayagala kugula kino
That’s a problem for a child.	Ekyo kizibu ku mwana.
But of course it would, you were young.	Naye ddala kyandibadde, wali muto.
I have time to do it	Nnina obudde okukikola
Call the office or myself.	Kuba ofiisi oba nze kennyini.
I don’t like that.	Ekyo sikyagala.
He could do it again.	Yali asobola okuddamu okukikola.
I still can’t believe he’s actually here	N’okutuusa kati siyinza kukkiriza nti ddala ali wano
I didn’t know who you were	Nze nali simanyi ani gwe wali
Too many hours.	Ssaawa nnyingi nnyo.
We have no idea this will happen.	Tetulina kirowoozo kyonna nti kino kijja kubaawo.
This is exactly the same.	Kino kye kimu ddala.
I hope you might as well	Nsuubira nti oyinza nga bwe kiri
He had to do it himself.	Yalina okukikola ye kennyini.
There is no one in the room.	Tewali muntu yenna mu kisenge.
I hope tomorrow is safe	Nsuubira nti enkya eri bulungi
I just need to eat .	Nze nneetaaga kulya kyokka .
But that’s what it is.	Naye ekyo kye kiri.
I didn’t know he lived here	Nnali simanyi nti abeera wano
You were always there.	Bulijjo wali awo.
I was right behind him	Nze nnali emabega we ddala
I just thought you might	Nze nnalowooza kyokka nti oyinza
He started reading the book.	Yatandika okusoma ekitabo ekyo.
I’m sure he’ll be very happy	Nkakasa nti ajja kuba musanyufu nnyo
And close to me.	Era kumpi nange.
I wish my dad was here.	Njagala nnyo taata yandibadde wano.
In any case.	Mu mbeera yonna.
It was one guy.	Yali ggaayi omu.
I didn’t know who you were	Nze nali simanyi ggwe ani
You are the only one.	Ggwe ggwe wekka.
I have no idea why this is happening	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso
He is the best.	Ye asinga.
I wanted to be there	Nnali njagala kubeerawo
I am happy.	Ndi musanyufu.
I was hoping he would talk to you about it	Nali nsuubira nti ajja kwogera naawe ku nsonga eyo
All right, well, we can talk about that right now.	Kirungi, bulungi, tusobola okwogera ku ekyo kati kati.
I still won’t believe it	N’okutuusa kati sijja kukkiriza
I knew what he wanted	Nali mmanyi kye yali ayagala
I think maybe you should continue at home	Ndowooza mpozzi wandibadde ogenda mu maaso awaka
I am a very lucky person to be in this position.	Ndi muntu wa mukisa nnyo okubeera mu kifo kino.
He is a very strong man.	Musajja wa maanyi nnyo.
What we are.	Kye tuli.
I wonder, how far are we going	Nze nneebuuza, tugenda okutuuka wa
I should have read this book	Nnali nsaanidde okusoma ekitabo kino
It’s difficult.	Kizibu.
I hope we’ll all be okay	Nsuubira nti ffenna tujja kuba bulungi
You know how it is.	Omanyi engeri gye kiri.
Below are his reasons.	Wansi waliwo ensonga ze.
However, we shall see.	Kyokka, tujja kulaba.
Now there is.	Kati waliwo.
I couldn’t drive alone	Nnali sisobola kuvuga nzekka
Surely, today is not the day.	Mazima ddala, leero si lwe lunaku.
I will be thinking of you and you every day	Nja kuba ndowooza ku ggwe naawe buli lunaku
I can’t do anything about it.	Nze sirina kye nsobola kukola.
I wanted this as much as you did	Kino nali njagala nga ggwe
It’s not easy, but it’s easy.	Si kyangu, naye kyangu.
It would be him.	Kyandibadde ye.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
I’m sure it’s a matter of money	Nkakasa nti nsonga ya ssente
I love watching her sleep	Njagala nnyo okulaba nga yeebase
I feel strong.	Mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi.
It is very, very important.	Kikulu nnyo nnyo.
I know that now.	Ekyo nkimanyi kati.
He said he could go to his job.	Yagambye nti asobola okugenda ku mulimu gwe.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
I wasn’t even going to school	Nnali sigenda wadde ku ssomero
I wanted to stay.	Nnali njagala kusigala.
The movie was great.	Firimu yali nnungi nnyo.
He said there was no time at all.	Yagambye nti tewali budde bwonna.
I didn’t know at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi.
I'm completely sorry.	Nsonyiwa ddala.
I know they were here	Nkimanyi nti baali wano
I’m just doing it.	Nze nkola kyokka.
I am also absolutely everything	Nze era ndi buli kimu ddala
He was truly alone now.	Mazima ddala yali yekka kati.
It’s just normal.	Kya bulijjo kyokka.
Anyone else having this problem?.	Waliwo omulala yenna alina ekizibu kino?.
And that’s what he did here.	Era ekyo kye yakola wano.
It can work well.	Kiyinza okukola obulungi.
But I can't find a way to do that.	Naye sisobola kufuna ngeri gye nnyinza kukola ekyo.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Era si kibi.
He must.	Ateekwa.
I couldn’t believe it was him.	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti ye ye.
I guess we’ll have to see what happens.	Ntebereza nti tujja kuba tulina okulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
Luckily for us that’s not saying much.	Omukisa gye tuli ekyo si kwogera bingi.
My father was at work.	Taata yali ku mulimu.
We cannot accept this fact.	Tetusobola kukkiriza nsonga eno.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
I was really lucky	Ddala nnali wa mukisa
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
But you know that.	Naye ekyo okimanyi.
Anyone can see through.	Omuntu yenna asobola okulaba mu.
What should he do?.	Akole ki?.
And that would be nice.	Era ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
He was very friendly.	Yali wa mukwano nnyo.
I really didn’t want anything	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kintu kyonna
Does he have a reason?.	Alina ensonga?.
But he isn’t.	Naye si bw’atyo.
He always said he slept well.	Bulijjo yagamba nti yeebase bulungi.
I think you can say something like this.	Ndowooza osobola okwogera ekintu nga kino.
I can’t believe this is it	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kino kye kiri
It was a very difficult time.	Kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
But that’s not dangerous.	Naye ekyo si kya bulabe.
I can’t go anywhere without it	Siyinza kugenda yonna nga sirina
That’s really important.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo ddala.
Not to anyone.	Si eri omuntu yenna.
It could be for you too.	Naawe kiyinza okuba nga kya ggwe.
Back in a little bit.	Okudda mu katono.
It will be you and me.	Kijja kuba nze naawe.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
But this idea worked.	Naye endowooza eno yakola.
It’s hard to make good time but it’s great.	Kizibu okukola obudde obulungi naye nga kirungi nnyo.
That’s absolutely it.	Ekyo kiri ddala.
But there is no power.	Naye tewali maanyi.
We’re not the only ones.	Si ffe ffekka.
I thought we were in this together	Nalowooza nti mu kino tuli ffembi
We are just ourselves.	Ffe ffekka ffekka.
Not about this.	Si ku nsonga eno.
I was wondering that to myself	Ekyo nnali nneebuuza nze kennyini
We will have to act fast.	Tujja kuba tulina okukola amangu.
I do anyway.	Nze nkola mu ngeri yonna.
I have a person too	Nze nange nnina omuntu
I hope you will agree	Nsuubira nti ojja kukkiriza
I could think it was mine	Nnali nsobola okulowooza nti yange
I’m not sure if we can do that again.	Sikakasa oba tusobola okuddamu okukola ekyo.
He had to go.	Yalina okugenda.
I can’t find a reason why.	Sisobola kufuna nsonga lwaki.
Basically, it’s very dangerous.	Okusinga, kya bulabe nnyo.
But that’s what he was.	Naye ekyo kye yali.
But he is always sick.	Naye bulijjo mulwadde.
The guy went downstairs.	Ggaayi yagenda wansi.
You are with you.	Oli naawe.
I was hoping to talk to you	Nali nsuubira okwogera naawe
And that’s important.	Era ekyo kikulu.
He was already here.	Yali wano dda.
Everyone did their job well.	Buli omu yakola bulungi omulimu gwe.
She'll be fine, she thought.	Ajja kuba bulungi, bwe yalowooza.
That, of course, is up to you.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kiri gy’oli.
Without a job.	Nga talina mulimu.
I had no luck on that one either	Nze nange nnali sirina mukisa ku eyo
I don’t know why exactly.	Simanyi lwaki ddala.
But he knew better.	Naye yali asinga okumanya.
We’re all pretty much the same.	Ffenna tuli bulungi nnyo kye kimu.
He is the only thing for you.	Ye kintu kyokka gyoli.
I have to get back to work	Nnina okudda ku mulimu
He knew better, and that was that.	Yali asinga okumanya era ekyo kye kyali.
This is not a practical approach.	Eno si nkola ya nkola.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
I have so much to do	Nnina bingi nnyo bye nnina okukola
Clearly, this is not such a time.	Kya lwatu nti kino si kye kiseera ng’ekyo.
We need to know better.	Tulina okumanya obulungi.
I guess he won’t know that was me.	Ntebereza nti tajja kumanya nti oyo nnali nze.
Something that is difficult.	Ekintu ekizibu.
Someone else is doing it right.	Omuntu omulala akikola bulungi.
He was the best we could do.	Ye yali asinga obulungi gwe tusobola okukola.
Of course, we can also just talk.	Kya lwatu nti naffe tusobola okwogera kyokka.
I wanted to do all of that	Ebyo byonna nnali njagala okukola
I will probably be there	Oboolyawo nja kubeerawo
He obviously lives and works in something complicated.	Kirabika abeera era akola mu kintu ekizibu.
I have no idea why this is so hard.	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki kino kizibu nnyo.
He worked on this scene.	Yakola ku kifo kino.
Not for much, though.	Kyokka si lwa bingi.
And all in a hurry.	Era byonna mu bwangu.
He isn’t like that. 	Si bw’atyo. 
It’s not the same thing.	Si kintu kye kimu.
You won’t have any.	Tojja kuba n’akatono.
I think it was pretty cool though	Ndowooza kyali kirungi nnyo wadde
Nothing was too good for us.	Tewali kyali kirungi nnyo gye tuli.
I should do the same thing.	Nze nsaanidde okukola ekintu kye kimu.
That’s not the same thing.	Ekyo si kye kimu.
I guess that doesn’t matter	Ntebereza nti ekyo si kikulu
I can see that coming	Nsobola okulaba ekyo nga kijja
Here we will do what we have.	Wano tujja kukola kye tulina.
He wanted to go home.	Yali ayagala kudda waka.
He knew that now.	Ekyo kati yali akimanyi.
But this was easier said than done.	Naye kino kyali kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
You are the only one.	Ggwe oli omu yekka.
That’s all something.	Ebyo byonna kintu.
It is good to do that.	Kirungi okukola ekyo.
I wish my dad was here	Njagala nnyo taata yandibadde wano
The book is at the bottom of the floor.	Ekitabo kiri wansi wa wansi.
He fell asleep deeply.	Yeebase nnyo.
I knew it could only be one thing.	Namanya nti kiyinza okuba ekintu kimu kyokka.
I do the same with him.	Nze nkola kye kimu naye.
I needed somewhere to go	Nnali nneetaaga we nnali ngenda
We have no problem with that idea.	Tetulina buzibu ku ndowooza eyo.
He may return as soon as tonight.	Ayinza okudda amangu ddala ekiro kino.
I didn’t want to eat	Nnali saagala kulya
You don’t have to go, you know.	Tolina kugenda, omanyi.
He knew it all too well.	Yali akimanyi bulungi nnyo.
I think it looks great.	Ndowooza kirabika bulungi nnyo.
And he had his own things.	Era yalina ebintu bye.
I will do so many things	Nja kukola ebintu bingi nnyo
I knew it would happen	Nnali nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo
I feel the same way.	Nze mpulira kye kimu.
It’s easy, but it’s not easy.	Kyangu, naye si kyangu.
It could have been anything.	Kyandibadde kya ngeri yonna.
I loved my job	Omulimu gwange nnali njagala nnyo
He didn't know how to do that.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ya kukola ekyo.
Maybe just now.	Mpozzi kati kyokka.
He could make time.	Yali asobola okukola obudde.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
I was feeling things better	Ebintu nnali mpulira bulungi
And he actually looked happy.	Era mu butuufu yali alabika nga musanyufu.
You want it though.	Ggwe oyagala wadde.
I don’t really care about money	Sifaayo nnyo ku ssente
I couldn’t wait to eat	Nnali sisobola kulinda kulya
You think you can but you can’t.	Olowooza nti osobola naye tosobola.
He was happy.	Yali musanyufu.
I am currently at school	Mu kiseera kino ndi ku ssomero
Now he really wants one.	Kati ddala ayagala emu.
He calls on the subject.	Akuba essimu ku nsonga.
This is neither good nor bad.	Kino si kirungi oba kibi.
This is going very well.	Kino kigenda bulungi nnyo.
Not in the room.	Si mu kisenge.
But it was hard, hard.	Naye kyali kizibu, kizibu.
I thought that was going to be pretty easy	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kyali kigenda kuba kyangu nnyo
You are strong.	Oli wa maanyi.
I just wondered where they were	Nze nnali nneebuuza kyokka gye bali
That book is accurate.	Ekitabo ekyo kituufu.
And yet the same with him.	Era naye kye kimu naye.
I was really down.	Ddala nnali wansi.
I didn’t know he was here	Nnali simanyi nti yali wano
I really didn’t know what to believe	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kukkiriza
He knows he needs to make a call.	Akimanyi nti yeetaaga okukuba essimu.
That’s perfectly normal.	Ekyo kya bulijjo ddala.
Or maybe it’s real.	Oba mpozzi nga kya ddala.
Nothing is visible yet.	Tewali kintu kyonna kirabika n’okutuusa kati.
Not everyone can say the same thing.	Si buli muntu nti asobola okwogera ekintu kye kimu.
I can’t come right now	Sisobola kujja mu kiseera kino
I really didn’t know what to do	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kukola
We are so close.	Tuli kumpi nnyo.
I wasn’t sure before	Nze nali sikakasa emabegako
I can’t believe someone would do that	Siyinza kukkiriza nti omuntu yandikoze ekyo
You should read this book.	Olina okusoma ekitabo kino.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
He knew that for sure.	Ekyo yali akimanyi ddala.
He really really had.	Ddala ddala yalina.
Not that he would do such a thing.	Si nti yandikoze ekintu ng’ekyo.
But this is not uncommon.	Naye kino si kya bulijjo.
I like things to fit right.	Njagala nnyo ebintu okutuuka obulungi.
Of course, he could not do that.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
Glad he was okay.	Musanyufu nti yali bulungi.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
Three.	Ssatu.
But you have to do things.	Naye olina okukola ebintu.
You can’t get anything on me.	Tosobola kufuna kintu kyonna ku nze.
I loved spending time with him	Nnali njagala nnyo okumala naye obudde
That’s why it’s there.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki kiri awo.
I know you will.	Nkimanyi nti ojja kukikola.
He has me.	Alina nze.
He was friendly.	Yali wa mukwano.
There is no time.	Tewali budde.
Everyone goes home happy.	Buli omu agenda eka nga musanyufu.
But we’ll be fine.	Naye tujja kuba bulungi.
I hoped he wasn’t a teacher, although he probably was	Nali nsuubira nti si musomesa wadde nga osanga yali musomesa
I have been sick about it all week.	Mbadde mulwadde ku nsonga eyo wiiki yonna.
It will be really nice.	Kijja kuba kirungi ddala.
It doesn’t matter if there’s a way.	Si kikulu oba waliwo engeri.
I think he's a good guy	Ndowooza ggaayi mulungi
Not in this, he thought.	Si mu kino, bwe yalowooza.
That would be good for them.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi gye bali.
And so can all of us	Era naffe ffenna bwe tusobola
I am not sure if this is true.	Sikakasa oba kino kituufu.
I think she is a beautiful woman	Ndowooza mukyala mulungi
He could beat this thing, he thought.	Yali asobola okukuba ekintu kino, bwe yalowooza.
Like your dog.	Nga embwa yo.
I was hoping to talk to him earlier	Nali nsuubira okwogera naye emabegako
It was his time.	Kyali kiseera kye.
But tomorrow night.	Naye enkya ekiro.
I wanted to see who was better	Nnali njagala kulaba ani asinga
You or anyone else.	Ggwe oba omuntu yenna.
Anyone can achieve whatever they want	Omuntu yenna asobola okutuuka ku kyonna ky’ayagala
It’s not really any of my business.	Mu butuufu si nsonga yange yonna.
It’s a difficult place to live.	Kifo kizibu okubeera.
He had a reason.	Yalina ensonga.
I hoped he would.	Nnali nsuubira nti ajja kukikola.
And there he was.	Era awo we yali.
He says that	Agamba nti .
Here he is.	Wano w'ali.
Nothing comes to any good.	Tewali kintu kyonna kijja ku kirungi kyonna.
He's done it before.	Abadde akikola emabegako.
Maybe not so bad as that.	Mpozzi si kibi nnyo nga ekyo.
But not like us.	Naye si nga ffe.
I want to work on myself	Njagala kukola ku nze kennyini
I don’t want to be here myself	Nze kennyini saagala kubeera wano
He did really well.	Yakola bulungi ddala.
I am sick.	Ndi mulwadde.
That won’t work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola.
I belong to no one at all	Nze ndi wa muntu yenna n’akatono
Speaking up a lot.	Okwogera ennyo.
Maybe someone should be home.	Mpozzi omuntu yandibadde awaka.
I am very happy about this though	Ndi musanyufu nnyo ku nsonga eno wadde
I was actually there	Mu butuufu nnali awo
In that way, he was like me.	Mu ngeri eyo, yali nga nze.
I could feel this was a bad idea	Nnali mpulira nti kino kyali kirowoozo kibi
I didn’t know he was going home	Nali simanyi nti agenda kudda waka
I couldn’t say why	Nnali siyinza kwogera lwaki
You will really do it.	Ddala ojja kukikola.
But we could well have been unlucky.	Naye twali tusobola bulungi okuba nga tetulina mukisa.
And you could tell he loved it.	Era oyinza okulaba nti yali ayagala nnyo.
This will not work.	Kino tekijja kukola.
I said it would be you	Nagamba nti yandibadde ggwe
I can’t wait for that moment	Siyinza kulinda kiseera ekyo
He was here, he was there, he was everywhere.	Yali wano, yali awo, yali buli wamu.
I just love doing it	Nze njagala nnyo okukikola
I know you’re afraid.	Nkimanyi nti otya.
Maybe he would, too.	Mpozzi naye yandikoze.
He thought only of himself.	Yalowooza ku ye yekka.
You can buy whatever you want from here.	Osobola okugula kyonna ky’oyagala okuva wano.
He will talk to you.	Ajja kwogera naawe.
Although I can’t do anything	Wadde nga sirina kye nsobola kukola
He was very strong	Yali wa maanyi nnyo
This is actually not the case.	Kino mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
It doesn’t matter now, though.	Si kikulu kati, wadde.
That was a big deal anyway.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo mu ngeri yonna.
I can’t say anything about that	Ekyo siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna
That’s what it was here.	Ekyo kye kyali wano.
Very good, right.	Kirungi nnyo, kituufu.
I can’t say anything yet	Siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna n’okutuusa kati
I wanted to do something difficult	Nnali njagala okukola ekintu ekizibu
It’s not a matter of opinion.	Si nsonga ya ndowooza.
He had no reason.	Yali talina nsonga.
You may be the only one talking.	Oyinza okuba nga ggwe wekka ayogera.
Maybe he has.	Mpozzi alina.
You don’t have to talk to anyone about this.	Tolina kwogera na muntu yenna ku bino.
I have to do this myself	Kino nnina okukikola nze kennyini
I wanted those things.	Ebintu ebyo nnali njagala.
Not a serious issue yet.	Si nsonga ya maanyi n’okutuusa kati.
Everything is right.	Buli kimu kituufu.
I said absolutely.	Nagamba ddala.
I knew what we both needed	Nnali mmanyi kye twali twetaaga ffembi
I couldn’t see where we were	Nnali sisobola kulaba gye twali
I am the only one who is.	Nze nzekka nze.
It certainly won’t come.	Mazima ddala tekijja kujja.
I was very lucky	Nali wa mukisa nnyo
I wanted to spend time with him	Nnali njagala okumala naye obudde
You are a person who has things.	Oli muntu alina ebintu.
You are not a good man.	Toli musajja mulungi.
I could have done it.	Nnali nsobola okukikola.
I thought you’d be fine	Nalowooza nti ojja kuba bulungi
I have a lot of money now	Nnina ssente nnyingi kati
You are his wife.	Ggwe mukyala we.
It was definitely a force.	Mazima ddala yali maanyi.
I think you know where	Ndowooza omanyi wa
I will probably buy a house here	Oboolyawo nja kugula ennyumba wano
It’s not luck.	Si mukisa.
Not for anything.	Si lwa kintu kyonna.
Things like that.	Ebintu nga ebyo.
Not a good idea at all.	Si kirowoozo kirungi n’akatono.
I will do this.	Nja kukola kino.
I love living there	Njagala nnyo okubeera eyo
I don’t quite know why you won’t.	Simanyi bulungi lwaki tojja kukikola.
He is now in good shape.	Kati ali mu mbeera nnungi.
I hope it happens again	Nsuubira nti kijja kuddamu okubaawo
I like buying cars.	Njagala nnyo okugula mmotoka.
And it’s hard to see.	Era kizibu okulaba.
I have to go to the office.	Nnina okugenda mu ofiisi.
This is not like you.	Kino si nga ggwe.
I might go for that one too	Nze nange nnyinza okugenda ku oyo
In practice, this is real.	Mu nkola, kino kya ddala.
I’m not here, really much	Siri wano, ddala nnyo
I thought it would be good	Nalowooza nti kijja kuba kirungi
I am well aware of that	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi
I know this about him.	Kino nkimanyi ku ye.
I was definitely doing this	Kino nnali nkola ddala
But he was, too.	Naye naye yali.
And we will do it.	Era tujja kukikola.
I will not allow it to happen again	Sijja kukkiriza kuddamu kubaawo
I love having you here	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe wano
He is very strong.	Ali wa maanyi nnyo.
I know why he went on like that	Nkimanyi lwaki yagenda mu maaso bw’atyo
I have to eat.	Nnina okulya.
I didn’t need to do anything	Nnali sirina kye nneetaaga kukola
He couldn’t stay here.	Yali tasobola kusigala wano.
However, I wondered if she had slept with him	Kyokka nnali nneebuuza oba yali yeebase naye
I was here now.	Nze nali wano kati.
That wasn’t my problem.	Ekyo si kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
Me or mine.	Nze oba wange.
He said he was fine.	Yagambye nti ali bulungi.
But there is hope.	Naye waliwo essuubi.
I thought this would be it.	Nalowooza nti kino kye kyandibadde.
I wanted time to talk to you.	Nnali njagala obudde okwogera naawe.
Just a little bit though.	Katono ddala wadde.
That's good at that.	Ekyo mulungi mu ekyo.
It could be anything.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
He wants to talk to you.	Ayagala kwogera naawe.
I have no idea why I’m here	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki ndi wano
I really need to talk to him today	Nze ddala nneetaaga okwogera naye leero
It’s a thing of beauty.	Kintu kya bulungi.
Helping was probably a good idea.	Oboolyawo okuyamba kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
I know how important this is to you	Nkimanyi nti kino kikulu nnyo gy’oli
I thought he did a good job	Nnalowooza nti yakola omulimu mulungi
And it may be true.	Era kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
I absolutely love it	Nze njagala nnyo ddala
That was all over the place.	Ekyo kyali mu kifo kyonna.
This was a very difficult time	Kino kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo
I can’t live with you	Sisobola kubeera naawe
Not bad, he thought.	Si kibi, bwe yalowooza.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
I didn’t want to go, it wasn’t my idea	Saagala kugenda, si kye kyali kirowoozo kyange
There is only one problem with this idea.	Waliwo ekizibu kimu kyokka ku ndowooza eno.
Unusual.	Si kya bulijjo.
You can go.	Oyinza okugenda.
I'm praying a lot.	Nsaba nnyo.
He knew it was going soon.	Yali akimanyi nti okugenda mu bbanga ttono.
However, we can do better.	Kyokka, tusobola okukola obulungi.
I could see no answer in that	Mu ekyo nnali sisobola kulaba kuddamu
I wanted to know everything	Nnali njagala okumanya buli kimu
I doubt he ever did	Nbuusabuusa nti waliwo lwe yakikola
I am in this group	Nze ndi mu kibiina kino
I thought it was time	Nalowooza nti kye kiseera
For that, he would need money.	Ku ekyo, yandibadde yeetaaga ssente.
Maybe he's busy.	Mpozzi ali bbize.
I said it was easy.	Nagamba nti kyangu.
He didn’t like it very much.	Yali tayagala nnyo.
This is actually the case.	Kino mu butuufu bwe kiri.
Not even if he was good.	Si ne bwe yandibadde mulungi.
I’m still not going	N’okutuusa kati sigenda
He didn’t want to stay and help anyone.	Yali tayagala kusigala na kuyamba muntu yenna.
I don’t want anything from you	Saagala kintu kyonna okuva gy’oli
I am sure this is the case	Nkakasa nti kino bwe kiri
However, that is not the point.	Kyokka, eyo si y’ensonga.
He can’t go to the hospital.	Tasobola kugenda mu ddwaaliro.
But it is very difficult.	Naye kizibu nnyo.
I'm going now.	Nze ngenda kati.
He will come back to me.	Ajja kudda gyendi.
I could see no way to win	Nnali sisobola kulaba ngeri yonna gye nnyinza kuwangula
I guess that would be fine	Ntebereza nti ekyo kyandibadde kirungi
Talking to you.	Okwogera naawe.
He wanted to be close.	Yali ayagala kubeera kumpi.
No one will talk to us.	Tewali ajja kwogera naffe.
You know it always will.	Omanyi bulijjo kijja kubaawo.
There is just no place.	Tewali kifo kyokka.
I have to know everything	Nnina okumanya buli kimu
And as it is.	Era nga bwe kiri.
I will never be alone again	Sijja kuddamu kubeera nzekka
I knew it was mine	Namanya nti kyali kyange
I didn’t want to be sick	Nnali saagala kubeera mulwadde
There is no bad room in the house.	Tewali kisenge kibi mu nnyumba.
That’s what they’re there for.	Ekyo kye bali eyo.
I’m just not like that.	Nze si bwe kiri kyokka.
It was time to do anything.	Kyali kiseera kya kukola kintu kyonna.
I was the one who was me.	Nze nali nze.
I am strong.	Ndi wa maanyi.
I really didn’t quite know what to say	Mazima ddala nnali simanyi bulungi kya kwogera
I think that’s the same thing	Ndowooza ekyo kye kimu
Where were you always .	Bulijjo wali wa .
He wanted help.	Yali ayagala buyambi.
I was actually scared	Mu butuufu nnali ntya
We were in desperate need of it.	Twali twetaaga nnyo.
He had to stay for a long time.	Yalina okumala ebbanga ddene.
I know he is talking about me	Nkimanyi nti ayogera ku nze
But he is fine.	Naye ali bulungi.
Really good work.	Ddala mulimu mulungi.
I wonder what this could be	Nneebuuza kino kye kiyinza okuba
Either way, that was fine with me.	Mu ngeri yonna, ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
I want to know exactly what he was doing	Njagala okumanya ddala kye yali akola
I know he will want to help.	Nkimanyi nti ajja kwagala okuyamba.
He must be beautiful.	Ateekwa okuba nga mulungi.
I want to go home.	Njagala kudda waka.
I think the same.	Nze ndowooza kye kimu.
I wasn’t really that interested in the idea at all	Mu butuufu nnali sifaayo nnyo ku ndowooza eyo n’akatono
I’m not sure if that’s true.	Sikakasa oba ekyo kituufu.
I need to know it’s there	Nze nneetaaga okumanya nti kiri awo
He worked really hard on this one.	Yakola nnyo ddala ku eno.
I knew we needed to get out of here	Namanya nti twetaaga okuva wano
I knew nothing about it	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo
I can do that, you know	Ekyo nsobola okukikola, omanyi
I have so much to do	Nnina bingi nnyo bye nnina okukola
He is better than that.	Asinga ekyo.
I'm not so sure this is the case	Sikakasa nnyo nti kino bwe kiri
I know he did it.	Nkimanyi nti yakikola.
I won’t do anything without you	Sijja kukola kintu kyonna nga tolina
However, that is just me.	Kyokka ekyo nze nzekka.
Maybe you already have.	Mpozzi nga wali olina dda.
It’s great to see that.	Kirungi nnyo okulaba ekyo.
I would love to talk to you.	Njagala nnyo okwogera naawe.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I can say all things	Nsobola okwogera ebintu byonna
You can do it at night.	Osobola okukikola ekiro.
And he still didn’t know what to say.	Era n’okutuusa kati yali tamanyi kya kwogera.
I feel that is definitely that	Mpulira nti ekyo mazima ddala
I knew there was something in you	Namanya nti waliwo ekintu mu ggwe
And he was definitely a good friend.	Era mazima ddala yali mukwano gwange mulungi.
I want to do it	Njagala kukikola
That's probably why.	Oboolyawo y'ensonga lwaki.
He wanted to go.	Ye yali ayagala okugenda.
I am a teacher.	Ndi musomesa.
I knew what we needed to do	Nnali mmanyi kye twali twetaaga okukola
I thought you should know	Nalowooza nti olina okumanya
I got some time this morning to talk to him	Nfunye akaseera enkya ya leero okwogera naye
I’ve been thinking about you	Mbadde ndowooza ku ggwe
That’s my father.	Oyo ye taata wange.
I need to know what he was going to say	Nnina okumanya kye yali agenda okwogera
I may not be gone for long	Nnyinza okuba nga sigenda okumala ebbanga ddene
Someone has to do it.	Omuntu alina okukikola.
I could go to my room	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu kisenge kyange
It’s not what it seems.	Si kye kirabika.
That’s a good place.	Ekyo kifo kirungi.
I can’t say what exactly	Siyinza kwogera kiki ddala
They were everywhere suddenly.	Baali buli wamu mu bwangu.
I feel that is definitely that.	Mpulira nti ekyo mazima ddala.
Not coming himself.	Si kujja ye kennyini.
I want to know	Njagala okumanya
Nor with his wife, too.	Wadde ne mukyala we, naye.
I won’t go back to them.	Sijja kudda gye bali.
You can pretty much do anything you want.	Osobola okusinga okukola ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala.
That’s pretty easy to see.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo okulaba.
I wanted to be with you	Nnali njagala kubeera naawe
I didn’t know what to say	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera
I didn’t know what to say	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera
I thought that's why we're here	Nalowooza nti y'ensonga lwaki tuli wano
I know where they are	Nze mmanyi gye bali
I was so scared I couldn’t speak.	Nnali ntya nnyo nga sisobola kwogera.
But that is probably not true.	Naye oboolyawo ekyo si kituufu.
I can’t say why right now	Siyinza kwogera lwaki mu kiseera kino
However, there is hope.	Kyokka waliwo essuubi.
Something that is difficult.	Ekintu ekizibu.
He did it for a while.	Yakikola okumala akaseera.
However, he couldn’t do it.	Kyokka yali tasobola kukikola.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
I think you absolutely have to do that	Ndowooza nti ekyo olina ddala okukikola
I hope that’s true	Nsuubira nti ekyo kituufu
Maybe it’s nothing.	Mpozzi nga si kintu kyonna.
Not so with him.	Si bwe kiri ku ye.
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kirungi.
I didn’t know what to say at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi kya kwogera
I have to spend some time with my dad tonight	Nnina okumala akaseera ne taata ekiro kino
I always knew this was coming	Bulijjo nnali mmanyi nti kino kijja
I thought it was pretty cool myself	Nze kennyini nnalowooza nti kyali kirungi nnyo
I don’t think that’s it.	Sirowooza nti ekyo kye kiri.
It was always easier to talk to him before.	Bulijjo kyali kyangu okwogera naye emabegako.
All I had was where I was going	Kye nnali nnina we nnali ngenda
I was hoping you knew what was going on	Nali nsuubira nti omanyi ekigenda mu maaso
I wanted to know who it was	Nnali njagala okumanya ani
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
You look good too.	Naawe olabika bulungi.
Nothing.	Tewali.
But no one really knows for sure.	Naye ddala tewali amanyi bulungi.
I am not alone in doing so	Si nze nzekka mu kukola ekyo
This certainly won’t happen.	Kino mazima ddala tekijja kubaawo.
Everyone knows you’re there.	Buli omu akimanyi nti oli awo.
I certainly wish it wasn’t.	Mazima ddala njagala nga si bwe kiri.
How can I do it.	Nnyinza ntya okukikola.
I don’t think we will	Sirowooza nti tujja kukikola
He was what he was and that was that.	Yali kye yali era ekyo kye kyali.
I know you are a very busy man.	Nkimanyi nti oli musajja bbize nnyo.
I guess it doesn’t really matter	Ntebereza nti mu butuufu si kikulu
It doesn’t matter what it is.	Si kikulu kiki kye kiri.
Can we do this? 	Kino tusobola okukikola?
I was already onto him	Nali dda ku ye
we can do this.	kino tusobola okukikola.
I have to see my dad	Nnina okulaba taata wange
I love driving at night.	Njagala nnyo okuvuga ekiro.
It was a beautiful place.	Kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
No one had any money.	Tewali yalina ssente yonna.
He didn't know when he'd finished.	Yali tamanyi ddi lwe yali amaze.
I want to do the same	Nze njagala okukola kye kimu
Anyone can say anything.	Omuntu yenna asobola okwogera ekintu kyonna.
I have to know everything.	Nze buli kimu nnina okumanya.
He didn’t like it very much.	Yali tayagala nnyo.
I think it will be very soon	Ndowooza kijja kuba mangu nnyo
He couldn’t see anyone on.	Yali tasobola kulaba muntu yenna ku.
This is certainly true in many cases.	Kino mazima ddala kituufu mu mbeera nnyingi.
We can’t do this.	Kino tetusobola kukikola.
. . . .	.
And it may be true.	Era kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
That could be him.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga ye.
It’s going on.	Kigenda mu maaso.
I’m sick of living this way.	Nze ndi mulwadde okubeera mu ngeri eno.
Maybe you will too.	Mpozzi naawe ojja kukikola.
I can't quite believe he's mine	Siyinza bulungi kukkiriza nti ye wange
You have it all.	Byonna olina.
Anyone else would too.	Omuntu omulala yenna naye yandibadde.
It was something.	Yali kintu.
I have the same problem	Nze nange nnina ekizibu kye kimu
In this case it is very difficult to do.	Mu mbeera eno kizibu nnyo okukola.
Pretty.	Mulungi.
He will certainly do it.	Mazima ddala ajja kukikola.
I couldn’t really talk to him	Mu butuufu nnali sisobola kwogera naye
And it would be easier.	Era kyandibadde kyangu.
That’s probably why.	Oboolyawo y’ensonga lwaki.
I'll talk to you again in the morning	Nja kuddamu okwogera naawe ku makya
This just isn’t the case.	Kino kyokka si bwe kiri.
And he does so.	Era akola bw’atyo.
You you.	Ggwe ggwe.
I didn’t want to be there	Nnali saagala kubeerawo
That's my point.	Eyo y'ensonga yange.
It doesn’t matter though.	Si kikulu wadde.
I have no idea.	Sirina ndowooza.
But he is still sick.	Naye akyali mulwadde.
I need to spend time with him	Nze nneetaaga kumala budde naye
He must move forward.	Ateekwa okugenda mu maaso.
He knew perfectly well.	Yali amanyi bulungi ddala.
I was truly lucky	Mazima ddala nnali nfunye omukisa
I have an appointment	Nnina essaawa gye nnali nfunye
I really didn’t care.	Mazima ddala nnali sifaayo.
I don’t really like it.	Sikyagala ddala.
I couldn’t form any thought	Nnali sisobola kukola kirowoozo kyonna
I feel good with you too	Nange mpulira bulungi naawe
He just looked like his dad.	Yalabika nga taata we yekka.
I know how hard it is	Nkimanyi engeri gye kizibu
This is the same for me.	Kino kye kimu gyendi.
He says no, he doesn't.	Agamba nti nedda.
There is so much in it.	Mulimu bingi nnyo.
This was a bad thing.	Kino kyali kibi.
That was pretty easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo.
He tried for a while.	Yagezaako okumala akaseera.
He knew things that no one else could.	Yali amanyi ebintu nga tewali asobola kumanya.
I know where they are now.	Nze mmanyi gye bali kati.
And of course this is in order.	Era ddala kino kiri mu nteekateeka.
He was there.	Yali awo.
It is, but that doesn’t matter.	Kiri, naye ekyo si kikulu.
I really needed a plan at this point	Nnali nneetaaga nnyo enteekateeka mu kiseera kino
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
He needs to go.	Yeetaaga okugenda.
I have, you have, we all have	Nnina, ggwe olina, ffenna tulina
I didn’t know that was it	Nze nali simanyi nti ekyo kye kyali
That’s a lot of money for us.	Ekyo ssente nnyingi gye tuli.
I just want to do it.	Njagala kukikola kyokka.
I’m still not entirely sure	Nze n’okutuusa kati sikakasa ddala
Everyone knows it.	Buli omu akimanyi.
Not one.	Si emu.
Everything will work.	Buli kimu kijja kukola.
We have the time.	Tulina obudde.
I want to you	Njagala gyoli
None of these things.	Tewali na kimu ku bino.
That’s what this is.	Ekyo kino kye kiri.
We’re not going anywhere here.	Tetulina we tugenda wano.
I have to get home.	Nnina okutuuka awaka.
I have no problem with that.	Ekyo sirina buzibu bwonna.
I am very happy and will definitely buy again	Ndi musanyufu nnyo era mazima ddala nja kuddamu okugula
It seems to be true.	Kirabika kituufu.
He was his brother.	Yali muganda we.
I had no idea who was here or why	Nnali simanyi ani yali wano oba lwaki
And that’s the problem.	Era ekyo kye kizibu.
I know so many things.	Nze mmanyi ebintu bingi nnyo.
To myself as well.	Eri nze kennyini nange.
It is much more important than that.	Kikulu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
You have to think for everyone.	Olina okulowooza ku lwa buli muntu.
I hope everyone can work out their own issues.	Nsuubira buli omu asobola okukola ku nsonga ze.
You will do it.	Ojja kukikola.
Or here, another one.	Oba wano, omulala.
He is sick.	Ali mulwadde.
He was so close now.	Yali kumpi nnyo kati.
But he could do nothing about that.	Naye ekyo yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
I want to go home and	Njagala kudda waka era
But not his father.	Kyokka si taata we.
I don’t want to go to jail	Saagala kugenda mu kkomera
I couldn’t believe this was it	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti kino kye kyali
And now this movie.	Era kati firimu eno.
I wanted some alone time with you	Nnali njagala akaseera nga ndi nzekka naawe
And I'm like.	Era nze ndi nga.
Someone had to do it	Waliwo omuntu yalina okukikola
I knew that was coming	Namanya nti ekyo kyali kijja
What's the problem.	Kiki ekizibu.
He was still there.	Yali akyali awo.
You won’t do that.	Ekyo tojja kukikola.
I need to know if you have	Nnina okumanya oba olina
Now that is not the case.	Kati ekyo si bwe kiri.
He needed food.	Yali yeetaaga emmere.
I wasn’t good enough.	Nze nali siri mulungi.
And he had been.	Era yali abadde.
He got what he wanted.	Yafuna kye yali ayagala.
I have to do this, or no one will	Kino nnina okukikola, oba si ekyo tewali ajja kukikola
I didn’t know what to say or do	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera oba kya kukola
That is very, very dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe nnyo nnyo.
You are ready to go home.	Oli mwetegefu okudda eka.
We will have to go to my place.	Tujja kuba tulina okugenda mu kifo kyange.
Everything was exactly as he expected.	Buli kimu kyali ddala nga bwe yali asuubira.
He has everything.	Alina buli kimu.
No one wanted to talk about it.	Tewali yali ayagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
I couldn’t tell exactly what he was doing	Nnali sisobola kumanya bulungi kye yali akola
Not in my city.	Si mu kibuga kyange.
It's down there, it's good.	Kiri wansi awo, kirungi.
I couldn’t find an answer	Nnali sisobola kufuna kya kuddamu
You can only see.	Osobola okulaba kyokka.
You and you.	Ggwe naawe.
I was there and it was very intimate	Nali awo era nga kya mukwano nnyo
You can make any shape you want.	Oyinza okukola ekifaananyi kyonna ky’oyagala.
I don’t have anything.	Sirina kye nnina.
I hope he has his reasons	Nsuubira nti alina ensonga ze
We need to go.	Twetaaga okugenda.
Tomorrow we will be with him.	Enkya tujja kuba naye.
Like nothing he did mattered.	Nga tewali kye yakola kyali kikulu.
I know what it is like.	Nze mmanyi bwe kiri.
I don’t know what it is.	Simanyi kiki.
But it’s not good.	Naye si kirungi.
I guess everyone and everything	Ntebereza buli muntu na buli kimu
This may well be the case.	Kino kiyinza bulungi okuba nga bwe kiri.
It is very important to get to this point.	Kikulu nnyo okutuuka ku nsonga eno.
He certainly had.	Mazima ddala yalina.
He could hardly speak.	Yali tasobola bulungi kwogera.
And, apparently, he couldn’t.	Era, kirabika, yali tasobola.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
I thought you would be here	Nalowooza nti ojja kuba wano
You can see how hard it really is.	Osobola okulaba engeri gye kizibu ddala.
No it really isn’t.	Nedda ddala si bwe kiri.
Now he knew what that thing was.	Kati yali amanyi ekintu ekyo kye kyali.
But this is a very important thing.	Naye kino kintu kikulu nnyo.
I’ve just got it.	Nze nfunye kyokka.
I guess they always were	Ntebereza bulijjo bwe baali
I think that’s what he was doing.	Ndowooza ekyo kye yali akola.
Now I can’t talk to you	Kati sisobola kwogera naawe
I was happy to do it.	Nnali musanyufu okukikola.
Every morning on my way to work.	Buli ku makya nga ngenda ku mulimu.
No, not because of what he thought.	Nedda, si lwa ekyo kye yali alowooza.
No one in my time did.	Tewali muntu yenna mu kiseera kyange yakikola.
I was doing pretty well	Nali nkola bulungi nnyo
I love doing that	Njagala nnyo okukola ekyo
I think he will do very well	Ndowooza ajja kukikola bulungi nnyo
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
I’m his father.	Nze taata we.
He won’t be home.	Tajja kubeera waka.
I need to do things my way	Nneetaaga okukola ebintu mu ngeri yange
The problem is common.	Obuzibu bwa bulijjo.
That’s a good thing.	Ekyo kintu kirungi.
Maybe very soon.	Mpozzi mu bbanga ttono ddala.
No one can do anything.	Tewali asobola kukola kintu kyonna.
He says he is completely normal.	Agamba nti wa bulijjo ddala.
I know very well how good you are.	Nze mmanyi bulungi nnyo engeri gy’oli omulungi.
But that could just be me.	Naye ekyo kiyinza okuba nze nzekka.
You are my son.	Ggwe mwana wange.
It’s not a good idea.	Si kirowoozo kirungi.
I just wanted to talk to you	Nnali njagala kwogera naawe kyokka
This is not the time for that.	Kino si kiseera kya ekyo.
You are mine.	Ggwe oli wange.
I won’t try it.	Sijja kugezaako.
That was a difficult time for us.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kizibu gye tuli.
I knew he wasn’t my father	Namanya nti si ye taata wange
But here, there isn’t.	Naye wano, tewali.
In any case.	Mu ngeri yonna.
I really hope you can do it	Nsuubira ddala nti osobola okukikola
He couldn’t seem to do it.	Yalabika nga tasobola kukikola.
He had no plans.	Yali talina nteekateeka yonna.
You know everybody.	Omanyi buli muntu.
I almost never will, you know	Nze kumpi sijja, omanyi
I'll answer knowing that	Nja kuddamu nga mmanyi ekyo
That, of course, is what he is.	Ekyo, ddala, ky’ali.
I don’t want money.	Saagala ssente.
I had found it.	Nnali nfunye.
I wonder if he knows	Nze nneebuuza oba amanyi
In going with him.	Mu kugenda naye.
I don’t know how much.	Simanyi ssente mmeka.
He almost didn’t want to.	Kumpi yali tayagala.
I actually feel better than comfortable	Mu butuufu mpulira bulungi okusinga okubeera obulungi
I feel very strong	Mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi nnyo
It goes very quickly.	Kigenda mangu nnyo.
He was glad he didn't have to.	Yali musanyufu nti yali talina kukikola.
And then, nothing.	Era awo, tewali kintu kyonna.
Like buying food.	Nga okugula emmere.
He wants it right away.	Ayagala mangu ddala.
I knew he would be with you	Nali nkimanyi nti ajja kuba naawe
I was there to eat.	Nali awo okulya.
No one was into anything.	Tewali yali mu kintu kyonna.
I want that as much as you do	Ekyo nange njagala nga ggwe
No one was anywhere.	Tewali muntu yenna yali yonna.
You certainly can’t do that.	Mazima ddala ekyo tosobola kukikola.
He's fine.	Ali bulungi.
I wasn’t sure how long this was going to last	Kino nnali sikakasa bbanga ki nga kino kyali kigenda kumala
I have no strength.	Sirina maanyi.
That’s going to happen.	Ekyo kigenda kubaawo.
I’m normal now.	Nze ndi wa bulijjo kati.
I didn’t know what was going on	Nnali simanyi kigenda mu maaso
I will be right down.	Nja kuba wansi ddala.
I need everyone there	Nneetaaga buli muntu ali eyo
I think he heard a lot of things	Ndowooza yawulira ebintu bingi
I thought this would be a good time for it.	Nalowooza nti kino kyandibadde kiseera kirungi gye kiri.
Obviously not then.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kyali mu kiseera ekyo.
It will be dangerous.	Kijja kuba kya bulabe.
It would be great for you, great.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo gy’oli, kirungi nnyo.
Everyone could say that.	Buli omu yali asobola okwogera bw’atyo.
I need to be with him	Nze nneetaaga okubeera naye
You really are.	Ggwe ddala oli.
I need to know that’s not true	Nnina okumanya nti ekyo si kituufu
He was such a nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi bwatyo.
I love the food.	Njagala nnyo emmere.
E will know he is here	E ajja kumanya nti ali wano
He is my father.	Ye taata wange.
It’s actually not too bad.	Mu butuufu si kibi nnyo.
You don’t know exactly.	Tomanyi bulungi.
Not a chance for that.	Si mukisa gwa ekyo.
No answer at all.	Tewali kuddamu n’akatono.
That’s how he did it.	Bwatyo bwe yakikola.
I’m ready to do something.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola ekintu.
He was a doctor himself.	Ye kennyini yali musawo.
You have been though a lot.	Obadde wadde nga bingi.
One by one.	Omu ku omu.
I was in a difficult place	Nali mu kifo kizibu
Or it’s too easy.	Oba kyangu nnyo.
There is .	Waliwo .
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
You can imagine what he was doing.	Oyinza okulowooza ku ekyo kye yali akola.
It’s not for everyone.	Si kya buli muntu.
indeed.	ddala ddala.
As always, he does it anyway.	Nga bulijjo, akikola mu ngeri yonna.
He certainly won’t come	Mazima ddala tajja kujja
The problem is, it’s not true.	Obuzibu buli nti, si kituufu.
This is not a good practice.	Eno si nkola nnungi.
I wanted him too	Nnali njagala naye naye
He wanted everything.	Yali ayagala buli kimu.
I wanted to get out of there	Nnali njagala okuva awo
I feel like it is.	Mpulira nga bwe kiri.
He was a morning person.	Yali muntu wa makya.
So far, it’s good.	N’okutuusa kati, kirungi.
But it won’t matter.	Naye tekijja kuba kikulu.
I knew exactly who he was	Nnali mmanyi bulungi ani gwe yali
I didn’t want to go.	Nnali saagala kugenda.
He is with us.	Ali naffe.
My wife.	Mukyala wange.
I think this is what we have to do.	Ndowooza kino kye tulina okukola.
He knew how hard it was to do.	Yali amanyi engeri gye kyali kizibu okukola.
Indeed it is.	Mazima bwe kiri.
And he knew that for a reason.	Era ekyo yali akimanyi lwa nsonga.
Obviously they were.	Kya lwatu nti baali.
He could hardly say that.	Ekyo yali tasobola bulungi kwogera.
You can certainly do this.	Mazima ddala kino osobola okukikola.
He didn’t want to do it, the way it seemed to me.	Yali tayagala kukikola, engeri gye kyali kirabika gyendi.
I know nothing about myself	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nze
I guess this will work	Ntebereza kino kijja kukola
My father wanted to do the same.	Taata naye yali ayagala okukola kye kimu.
He now has.	Kati alina...
What I thought about the process	Kye nnalowooza ku nkola
That we will both do it.	Nti ffembi tujja kukikola.
We’re fine,’ he said.	Tuli bulungi,’ bwe yagambye.
That’s very hard to do.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo okukola.
For any one week.	Ku wiiki emu yonna.
He had nothing.	Yali talina kintu kyonna.
I didn’t have much to say about it	Nnali sirina bingi bye nnyinza kwogera ku nsonga eyo
What? 	Kiki?
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
In this case it is not.	Mu mbeera eno si bwe kiri.
I have a lot to gain.	Nnina bingi bye nnyinza okufuna.
No one could see anything.	Tewali yali asobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
That’s really good.	Ekyo kirungi ddala.
I can’t wait to work	Siyinza kulinda kukola
I couldn’t tell where	Nnali sisobola kumanya wa
Surely, that is good.	Mazima ddala, ekyo kirungi.
And it was true.	Era kyali kituufu.
However, that is not entirely true.	Kyokka, ekyo si kituufu ddala.
I wanted to do the same	Nze nange nnali njagala okukola kye kimu
It could be you.	Kiyinza okuba nga ggwe.
I should be able to.	Nsaanidde okuba nga nsobola.
I needed to read that this morning	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga okusoma enkya ya leero
I’m sure he’s not a real person.	Nkakasa nti si muntu ddala.
I’m working on one.	Nkola ku emu.
He may have found someone else.	Ayinza okuba nga yafuna omuntu omulala.
I want it all.	Njagala byonna.
It’s everything.	Kye buli kimu.
However, I needed help	Kyokka nnali nneetaaga obuyambi
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
But at any point he would.	Naye mu kiseera kyonna yandikoze.
For this and this alone.	Ku lwa kino ne kino kyokka.
The problem is very serious.	Ekizibu kikulu nnyo.
And they were friends.	Era baali ba mukwano.
He had to think clearly.	Yalina okulowooza obulungi.
I have to make a plan	Nnina okukola enteekateeka
It will surely come.	Mazima ddala kijja kujja.
I just didn’t want to believe it	Nze nnali saagala kukkiriza kyokka
I need to get out of here	Nze nneetaaga okuva wano
You and I are both.	Nze naawe ffembi.
He couldn’t go on like that.	Yali tasobola kugenda mu maaso bw’atyo.
He had a plan.	Yalina enteekateeka.
I highly doubt he will come though	Nbuusabuusa nnyo nti ajja kujja wadde
I have a lot of plans to make	Nnina enteekateeka nnyingi ze nnina okukola
I can do this, no problem	Kino nsobola okukikola, tewali buzibu
But it’s everything.	Naye nga buli kimu.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
I think you should.	Ndowooza wandibadde okola.
I needed this out of the room.	Kino nnali nneetaaga okuva mu kisenge.
I knew it was me, always me	Namanya nti nze, bulijjo nze
I would love to read this book	Njagala nnyo okusoma ekitabo kino
My father.	Taata wange.
What's going on?.	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso?.
I’ll be back in time for dinner	Nja kudda mu budde okulya ekyeggulo
Everything is right	Buli kimu kituufu
I don’t want any help.	Saagala buyambi bwonna.
It’s time to think about it.	Kye kiseera okulowooza ku nsonga eno.
I thought it would be very romantic	Nalowooza nti kyandibadde kya mukwano nnyo
And he is my best friend.	Era mukwano gwange nnyo.
I didn’t know what my issue was	Nnali simanyi nsonga yange gye yali
I couldn’t believe he was thinking that though	Ekyo nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti yali alowooza wadde
He talks to the police.	Ayogera ne poliisi.
I've always been like that.	Bulijjo bwe ndi.
It’s a really good phone.	Essimu nnungi ddala.
You were a child.	Ggwe wali mwana muto.
And .	Ne .
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
I don’t know what it is, really.	Simanyi kiki, ddala.
Really.	Kituufu.
I’m going to jail.	Ngenda mu kkomera.
I was always in the same office	Bulijjo nnali mbeera mu ofiisi emu
I am very strong.	Ndi wa maanyi nnyo.
I won’t, I won’t again	Sijja, sijja kuddamu
I am very happy to be	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera
I just wanted to do it	Nnali njagala kukikola kyokka
The point is, it’s true.	Ensonga eri nti, kituufu.
I don’t think that’s true.	Ekyo sirowooza nti kituufu.
This had to be the case.	Kino kyalina okuba nga bwe kiri.
He himself asked for help.	Ye kennyini yasaba obuyambi.
You have to go, she said.	Olina okugenda, bwe yagamba.
We needed to know.	Twali twetaaga okumanya.
Not me over the other guy.	Si nze ku ggaayi omulala.
Reading, reading, reading.	Okusoma, okusoma, okusoma.
This is what it is.	Kino kye kiri.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
He didn’t want to go home.	Yali tayagala kudda waka.
I thought I was the only one.	Nalowooza nti nze nzekka.
It’s not too difficult.	Si kizibu nnyo.
It would be really bad.	Kyandibadde kibi ddala.
There is only one problem.	Ekizibu kimu kyokka.
I had nothing of the sort	Nnali sirina kintu kya ngeri eyo
I’m not the only one	Si nze nzekka
But it’s the same thing.	Naye kye kimu.
I couldn’t do anything	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
As simple as that.	Nga bwe kyali kyangu nga ekyo.
He wants to do it	Ayagala okukikola
I’m glad you’re okay	Ndi musanyufu nti oli bulungi
I was working towards something now	Nali nkola okutuuka ku kintu kati
My house is a powerful place.	Ennyumba yange kifo kya maanyi.
I didn’t want that.	Ekyo nnali saagala.
And as it is.	Era nga bwe kiri.
I feel like my father.	Nze mpulira nga taata wange.
But you are not.	Naye ggwe si bwe kiri.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
It was there, too.	Kyali awo, era.
His problem was that he was too strong.	Obuzibu bwe yali nti yali wa maanyi nnyo.
Very very good .	Kirungi nnyo nnyo .
I know better than to do that.	Nze mmanyi okusinga okukola ekyo.
Of course it was true.	Kituufu kyali kituufu.
I'll be coming soon.	Nja kujja mangu.
I needed to get help	Nnali nneetaaga okufuna obuyambi
I will be with you.	Nja kubeera naawe.
I guess he is not well.	Ntebereza nti tali bulungi.
I just want you to talk to me about it	Njagala kyokka okwogera nange ku nsonga eyo
All right, this is it.	Kirungi, kino kye kiri.
But it is true '.	Naye kituufu '.
I’m doing the work.	Nze nkola omulimu.
I know that and that’s what matters	Ekyo nkimanyi era ekyo kye kikulu
I didn’t think he could do this	Kino nnali sirowooza nti asobola okukikola
I can’t let it happen	Siyinza kukkiriza kubaawo
But you do it.	Naye ggwe okola.
Of course, he had.	Kya lwatu nti yalina.
There is no one here but me.	Wano tewali muntu yenna okuggyako nze.
It’s important to me.	Kikulu gyendi.
I feel at home	Mpulira nga ndi waka
But he had to do it.	Naye yalina okukikola.
I’m going to get this to work.	Ngenda kufuna kino okukola.
You have my brother.	Olina muganda wange.
They are in us.	Bali mu ffe.
He was ready to go.	Yali mwetegefu okugenda.
I know it will happen.	Nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
He looks really good to us	Alabika bulungi ddala gye tuli
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I am a doctor too	Nange ndi musawo
And you know this is true.	Era okimanyi nti kino kituufu.
My son is my brother.	Mwana wange muganda wange.
I hope it happens soon	Nsuubira nti kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono
It would have been easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu.
But he was very good.	Naye yali mulungi nnyo.
I have to go home now	Nnina okudda eka kati
I thought about how to get out of there	Nalowooza ku ngeri gye nnyinza okuva mu kifo ekyo
That will happen very soon.	Ekyo kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono ddala.
Can someone help with this.	Omuntu asobola okuyamba ku kino.
I want to know what’s going on	Njagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
I knew you were coming	Namanya nti ojja
But not working.	Naye obutakola.
However, he could not do that.	Kyokka, ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
He was very good to us.	Yali mulungi nnyo gye tuli.
When we were next to each other.	Nga tuli kumpi buli omu.
I can’t tell.	Sisobola kumanya.
I couldn’t do it	Nnali sisobola kukikola
I'm really sorry you know	Nsonyiwa ddala omanyi
I have no desire to go at all	Sirina kye njagala kugenda n’akatono
You know what you want.	Omanyi ky’oyagala.
I just want to be with you tonight	Njagala kubeera naawe ekiro kino kyokka
He was going to try.	Yali agenda kugezaako.
They are fine the way they are.	Bali bulungi engeri gye bali.
I’m very happy here.	Nze wano ndi musanyufu nnyo.
I want to know better for you	Njagala kumanya bulungi gyoli
He accepted the offer.	Yakkiriza ekintu ekyo.
I will be back very soon	Nja kudda mu bbanga ttono ddala
I thought it was everything.	Nalowooza nti buli kimu.
Not much to go on.	Si bingi okugenda mu maaso.
But he will come, in his own time.	Naye ajja kujja, mu kiseera kye.
However, that it is the same.	Kyokka nti kye kimu.
I think maybe it could happen.	Ndowooza mpozzi kiyinza okubaawo.
I was, of course.	Nze nnali, ddala.
I was so scared	Nnali ntya nnyo
We will do our best.	Tujja kukola kyonna kye tusobola.
I wondered what they were	Nneebuuza nti kiki kye baali
And it was absolutely all over the place.	Era kyali ddala mu kifo kyonna.
I need help with this.	Kino nneetaaga obuyambi.
I couldn’t tell what that thing was	Nnali sisobola kumanya kintu ekyo kye kyali
I won’t be here much longer	Sijja kubeera wano okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo
It’s not really a problem.	Mu butuufu si kizibu.
I couldn’t do anything	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
This is very important to me.	Kino kikulu nnyo gyendi.
I'll talk to my father	Nja kwogera ne taata
You want to live in that house.	Oyagala kubeera mu nnyumba eyo.
He didn’t know if it was true.	Yali tamanyi oba kituufu.
I thought no one could be there	Nnalowooza nti tewali ayinza kubeerawo
Now they are.	Kati bwe bali.
I was almost to the point and.	Nali kumpi okutuuka mu era...
I hope we always will	Nsuubira bulijjo tujja kukikola
I need time alone with you	Nze nneetaaga obudde nzekka naawe
He was very happy with me.	Yali musanyufu nnyo nange.
I just want to go	Njagala kugenda kyokka
I want to know how it is	Njagala okumanya bwe kiri
I’m doing fine.	Nze nkola bulungi.
Just something about it.	Ekintu kyokka ku nsonga eyo.
You’ve been down.	Obadde wansi.
I have no idea what’s going on	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki ekigenda mu maaso
It could have been anything.	Kyandibadde kintu kyonna.
That’s what we are.	Ffe ekyo kye.
We are that.	Ffe tuli ekyo.
And this is what we have to say.	Era kino kye tulina okwogera.
Not even you.	Si wadde ggwe.
No one can get anything.	Tewali asobola kufuna kintu kyonna.
In fact, we can’t.	Mu butuufu, tetusobola.
I couldn’t believe we were actually going	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti ddala twali tugenda
I have nothing to say about that.	Ekyo sirina kye nnyinza kwogera.
This is a really quick one.	Eno ya mangu ddala.
I knew he didn’t want to be there	Namanya nti yali tayagala kubeerawo
He must help his friends.	Ateekwa okuyamba mikwano gye.
I don’t care who you are.	Sifaayo ku ani ggwe.
He is here now and here he will stay.	Ali wano kati era wano ajja kusigala.
He works very, very hard.	Akola nnyo nnyo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
Obviously not.	Kya lwatu si bwe kiri.
But now he couldn't.	Naye kati yali tasobola.
I knew it was too easy	Namanya nti kyali kyangu nnyo
He was strong .	Yali wa maanyi .
It’s not a good situation.	Si mbeera nnungi.
He had something to do.	Yalina kye yakola.
Maybe a lot, maybe not at all.	Mpozzi bingi, mpozzi n’akatono.
I thought you would.	Nnalowooza nti ojja kukikola.
Not to one guy.	Si ku ggaayi omu.
I knew he was good in his own way	Namanya nti mulungi mu ngeri ye
We are in the position.	Tuli mu kifo.
In the context.	Mu nsonga.
And he didn’t want to do too much anyway.	Era yali tayagala kukola bingi nnyo mu ngeri yonna.
He may not be there.	Kiyinza okuba nga tajja kubaawo.
I love this picture, I always have	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi kino, bulijjo nnina
And this is certainly true.	Era kino mazima ddala kituufu.
He knew he had it.	Yali akimanyi nti alina.
My father knew that my brother needed my father’s time as well.	Taata yali akimanyi nti muganda wange yali yeetaaga obudde bwa taata naye.
I wasn’t even sure if it was going to work	Nali sikakasa wadde oba kyali kigenda kukola
He loved talking to her.	Yali ayagala nnyo okwogera naye.
He has everything.	Alina buli kimu.
It will happen again.	Kijja kuddamu okubaawo.
I have no financial problems	Sirina buzibu bwa ssente
It was almost romantic	Kumpi kyali kya mukwano
But he knew that before he spoke.	Naye ekyo yali akimanyi nga tannaba kwogera.
I think we’ll be fine	Ndowooza tujja kuba bulungi
I can do it again.	Nsobola okuddamu okukikola.
I haven’t had anyone to tell.	Nze mbadde sirina gwe nnyinza kubuulira.
I'll go now.	Nja kugenda kati.
It’s all for you.	Byonna lwa ggwe.
I know that very well	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi nnyo
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
Me too.	Nange.
Not so today.	Si bwe kiri leero.
In my car.	Mu mmotoka yange.
He loved to drive cars.	Yali ayagala nnyo okuvuga mmotoka.
It won’t be easy for you.	Tekijja kuba kyangu gy’oli.
I think there is someone for everyone	Ndowooza waliwo omuntu wa buli muntu
But he had it.	Naye nga yalina.
Not me, no.	Si nze, nedda.
At that time, too.	Mu kiseera ekyo, era.
To everyone.	Eri buli omu.
I knew nothing about being a father.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku kubeera taata.
There’s you.	Waliwo ggwe.
This is now the case.	Kino kati bwe kiri.
Good for him.	Kirungi ku ye.
Not just me, but him.	Si nze nzekka, naye naye.
One-on-one.	Omuntu ku muntu.
I don’t think it is.	Sirowooza nti bwe kiri.
This does not seem to be the case	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri
You are everything.	Ggwe buli kimu.
You really do.	Okola ddala.
I was sure it was him	Nali nkakasa nti ye yali
I feel like we have too.	Mpulira nga naffe tulina.
She was that beautiful.	Yali mulungi bw’atyo.
I know what to expect with him	Nze mmanyi kye nsuubira naye
Not much of a process though.	Si nnyo nkola wadde.
Or maybe not him.	Oba oboolyawo si ye.
But that wasn’t his problem.	Naye ekyo si kye kyali ekizibu kye.
I'm fine with that.	Ekyo ndi bulungi.
Exactly what they were.	Ddala bwe baali.
I really don’t want to know.	Mazima ddala saagala kumanya.
And I’m not the only one.	Era si nze nzekka.
I'm not sure if that's the point or not.	Sikakasa oba eyo y'ensonga oba nedda.
As we have it.	Nga bwe tulina.
I couldn’t see how he could	Nnali sisobola kulaba ngeri gye yali asobola
He was in the background.	Yali emabega.
And he was there.	Era yali awo.
And that was it.	Era oyo ye yali.
I knew he was hopeful	Namanya nti yali alina essuubi
We will do whatever we can to help.	Tujja kukola kyonna kye tusobola okuyamba.
I didn’t know you had so much in you	Nali simanyi nti olina bingi nnyo mu ggwe
I’m not sure if that’s a bad thing.	Sikakasa oba ekyo kintu kibi.
No time for that.	Tewali budde bwa ekyo.
He would be there tomorrow morning.	Yandibadde awo enkya ku makya.
I feel like doing it at night.	Mpulira nga njagala okukikola ekiro.
I was unemployed.	Nnali sirina mulimu.
I don’t need anything.	Sirina kye nneetaaga.
I love being with me.	Njagala nnyo okubeera nange.
I do know one thing though	Nze mmanyi ekintu kimu wadde
I think that’s a good point	Ndowooza eyo nsonga nnungi
I guess this is the case.	Ntebereza nti kino bwe kiri.
He couldn't answer, although he knew what he was thinking.	Yali tasobola kuddamu wadde nga yali amanyi kye yali alowooza.
I was sure of that	Ekyo nnali nkakasa
Not a little bit.	Si katono.
It’s a dangerous job.	Omulimu gwa bulabe.
I like it this way much more	Njagala nnyo mu ngeri eno okusinga nnyo
I didn’t know if he was happy or not	Nali simanyi oba yali musanyufu oba nedda
You are so close to this.	Oli kumpi nnyo ne kino.
That’s why he wanted to talk to me.	Y’ensonga lwaki yali ayagala okwogera nange.
You were you.	Ggwe wali ggwe.
Nothing is as it seems.	Tewali kiri nga bwe kirabika.
I was home alone all night	Nnali waka nzekka ekiro kyonna
I thought you should know	Nze nalowooza nti olina okumanya
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
You should go there too.	Naawe wandibadde ogenda eyo.
Not if this continues.	Si singa kino kigenda mu maaso.
I want to work again	Njagala okuddamu okukola
He wasn’t happy.	Yali si musanyufu.
I was the one he wanted	Nze gwe yali ayagala
I have to go back downstairs	Nnina okudda wansi
I am always alone, really alone	Bulijjo ndi nzekka, ddala ndi nzekka
We can’t do that.	Ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
I don’t know what exactly.	Simanyi kiki ddala.
I'm not sure what to do about it	Sikakasa kya kukola ku nsonga eyo
I think it was very important	Ndowooza kyali kikulu nnyo
It’s not his job to know.	Si mulimu gwe okumanya.
I thought it was really good.	Nalowooza nti ddala kirungi.
Or admitted he did.	Oba yakkiriza nti yakikola.
I don’t know what it is, to this day	Simanyi kiki, n’okutuusa leero
And well you don’t have to.	Era bulungi tolina.
Although he had.	Wadde nga yalina.
I hope it’s there.	Nsuubira nti kiri awo.
This was good for me	Kino kyali kirungi gyendi
I didn’t know why he did that	Nnali simanyi lwaki yakola bw’atyo
I didn’t have any money either	Nange nali sirina ssente
I was supposed to be home an hour ago	Nali wa kubeera waka essaawa emu emabega
No way, kid.	Tewali ngeri yonna, mwana.
He didn't want to talk to anyone right now.	Yali tayagala kwogera na muntu yenna mu kiseera kino.
He doesn’t know how to love	Tamanyi kwagala
You know it’s not.	Omanyi si bwe kiri.
Perhaps he had.	Oboolyawo yalina.
Maybe this is an opportunity.	Mpozzi guno mukisa.
I didn’t know what he was talking about	Nnali simanyi kye yali ayogera
I really didn’t know what to say	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kwogera
But no man can know everything.	Naye tewali musajja ayinza kumanya buli kimu.
I think why you already know why	Ndowooza lwaki omanyi dda lwaki
All he had, almost, was time.	Kye yalina, kumpi, kyali kiseera.
I was here all the time	Nze nali wano buli kiseera
Little did I know that it was unusual	Nnali simanyi bulungi nti si kya bulijjo
I think he would rather talk to you	Ndowooza yandibadde asinga kwogera naawe
No, it's not good.	Nedda, kirungi nedda.
There is nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna.
He was on.	Yali ku...
I almost knew what it was	Katono mmanyi kye kyali
I need to work.	Nze nneetaaga okukola.
I have no desire to try to do that.	Ekyo sirina kye njagala kugezaako kukikola.
I was very strong, myself	Nze nnali wa maanyi nnyo, nze kennyini
Not easy, even then.	Si kyangu, ne mu kiseera ekyo.
I’m a pretty nice guy	Nze ggaayi omulungi ennyo
He was something, really good.	Yali kintu, mulungi ddala.
He loved talking to her.	Yali ayagala nnyo okwogera naye.
I wasn’t going to do it	Nze nali sigenda kukikola
And you too, obviously.	Era naawe, kya lwatu.
But no one will believe it.	Naye tewali ajja kukkiriza.
And now I'm on.	Era kati ndi ku.
I didn’t know anyone there	Nnali sirina gwe mmanyi eyo
This was a real thing.	Kino kyali kintu kya ddala.
This is certainly true.	Mazima ddala kino kituufu.
It’s not me.	Si nze.
That is a very important thing.	Ekyo kintu kikulu nnyo.
. . . .	.
Maybe that would be good for us.	Mpozzi ekyo kyandibadde kirungi gye tuli.
That's good at that.	Ekyo mulungi mu ekyo.
I was thinking about	Nali ndowooza ku
Despite that.	Wadde nga waliwo ekyo.
Or someone could.	Oba omuntu yali asobola.
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
I thought you might be	Nalowooza nti oyinza okuba nga ggwe
He was willing.	Yali ayagala.
I think it probably is.	Ndowooza osanga bwe kiri.
Maybe I plan on getting one, but not right now.	Mpozzi nteekateeka kufuna emu, naye si kati.
I was very ready	Nnali mwetegefu nnyo
I was afraid to talk to him	Nnali ntya okwogera naye
It was what it was.	Kyali kye kyali.
It was ancient.	Kyali kya dda.
I’m not sure what the reason was	Sikakasa nsonga ki gye kyali
I didn’t know what to do about it	Nali simanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo
He loved to work.	Yali ayagala nnyo okukola.
However, this is obviously not the case.	Kyokka, kya lwatu nti kino si bwe kiri.
It was a job he loved and it was good	Omulimu gwe yali ayagala era nga mulungi
This is a beautiful place.	Kino kifo kirungi nnyo.
Not in this hour.	Si mu ssaawa eno.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
We have a lot to do.	Tulina bingi bye tulina okukola.
And it likely will.	Era kirabika kijja kubaawo.
I’m sick of it.	Nze ndi mulwadde.
I hoped everything was fine	Nali nsuubira nti buli kimu kyali kirungi
In theory, this is the case.	Mu ndowooza, kino bwe kiri.
And you can see why.	Era osobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
It’s not for everyone.	Si ya buli muntu.
I want to see everything good in a person.	Njagala okulaba buli kirungi mu muntu.
No one should know he is near.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kumanya nti ali kumpi.
Perhaps that is what he should have done.	Oboolyawo ekyo kye yandibadde akola.
I was happy about that	Ekyo nnali musanyufu
Together, of course.	Nga tuli wamu, ddala.
Not here, anyway.	Si wano, mu ngeri yonna.
That’s not us.	Ekyo si ffe.
Each of these.	Buli kimu ku bino.
I wanted to go.	Nnali njagala kugenda.
Now that he had.	Kati nga bwe yalina.
I have to do this now	Kino nnina okukikola kati
I can’t come right now, not today	Sisobola kujja mu kiseera kino, si leero
That was probably bad on his part.	Ekyo oboolyawo kyali kibi ku ludda lwe.
I’m not that guy.	Si nze oyo ggaayi.
I will accept this office	Nja kukkiriza ofiisi eno
That was a lowly thing to do.	Ekyo kyali kintu kya wansi okukola.
He was the best.	Ye yali asinga.
I was stronger than he knew	Nali wa maanyi okusinga bwe yali amanyi
Same thing here.	Ekintu kye kimu wano.
I thought everyone would be happy	Nalowooza nti buli omu yandibadde musanyufu
There is nothing wrong with him.	Tewali kibi kyonna ku ye.
But we can’t do it without you.	Naye tetusobola kukikola nga tolina.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si ekyo kyokka.
She would have to talk to him about it.	Yandibadde alina okwogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
But everyone knew who he was and who he was.	Naye buli omu yali amanyi ky’ali era ky’ali.
I have nothing to do with that	Ekyo sirina kye nkola
I love this movie	Njagala nnyo firimu eno
I might do that sometime this week	Ekyo nnyinza okukikola essaawa yonna wiiki eno
And that’s not really a problem for me at all.	Era ekyo mu butuufu si kizibu gyendi n’akatono.
It’s good to be here.	Kirungi okubeera wano.
What a beautiful woman.	Nga mukyala mulungi ddala.
I know it seems rushed but it wasn’t	Nkimanyi nti kirabika kya bwangu naye si bwe kyali
He couldn’t do that.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
However, that will probably be fine.	Kyokka, oboolyawo ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
I am really a doctor	Ddala ndi musawo
I have no idea if that’s true.	Sirina kye mmanyi oba ekyo kituufu.
I was a good guy.	Nze nali ggaayi mulungi.
Yourself, myself, just us.	Ggwe kennyini, nze kennyini, ffe ffekka.
I'll know.	Nja kumanya.
And he had no money.	Era nga talina ssente.
I guess that’s what he was good at.	Ntebereza nti kye yali mulungi mu.
If it was true they were in a lot of trouble.	Singa kyali kituufu baali mu buzibu bungi.
You want to be there.	Oyagala kubeerawo.
I wanted to, but I was afraid	Nali njagala naye nga ntya
However, I just don’t care.	Kyokka nze sifaayo kyokka.
I don’t think he got one.	Sirowooza nti yafuna emu.
He said he was happy to help.	Yagambye nti musanyufu okuyamba.
He had to do it.	Yalina okukikola.
I expected so much from you	Nnali nsuubira bingi nnyo okuva gy’oli
Or just .	Oba kyokka .
Are you sure you want to continue?.	Okakasa nti oyagala kugenda mu maaso?.
But that’s the same thing.	Naye ekyo kye kimu.
I am afraid he will never be well again	Ntya nti tajja kuddamu kubeera bulungi
You know we can do it.	Omanyi nti tusobola okukikola.
I was alone, as usual	Nali nzekka, nga bulijjo
But it was really hard.	Naye ddala kyali kizibu.
We have to do the same.	Naffe tulina okukola kye kimu.
It’s up to me.	Kiri eri nze.
I think money is good	Ndowooza ssente nnungi
I can’t wait!!.	Siyinza kulinda!!.
I was beautiful too.	Nange nnali mulungi.
Someone has to help someone.	Omuntu alina okuyamba omuntu.
Everyone is coming.	Buli omu ajja.
I can’t do anything like that	Sisobola kukola kintu kyonna nga ekyo
He is a regular guy.	Ye ggaayi wa bulijjo.
For me it’s hard to do	Nze kizibu okukola
I wanted to be there.	Nnali njagala kubeera eyo.
Surely that would be true.	Mazima ddala ekyo kyandibadde kituufu.
He is very lonely.	Ali yekka nnyo.
Or me, anyway.	Oba nze, mu ngeri yonna.
I can see everyone	Nsobola okulaba buli muntu
He was her best friend.	Yali mukwano gwe ennyo.
I want to move on	Njagala kugenda mu maaso
I wanted that too, but not now	Ekyo nange nnali njagala naye kati si bwe kiri
He was certainly very .	Mazima ddala yali nnyo .
You can answer, or not.	Osobola okuddamu, oba nedda.
However, I couldn’t believe it	Kyokka nnali sisobola kukkiriza
I feel much better about all of this now	Mpulira bulungi nnyo ku bino byonna kati
You have truly been a blessing to me.	Mazima ddala obadde mukisa gyendi.
I knew something was going down	Namanya nti waliwo ekigenda wansi
I wasn’t so sure yet	Nze n’okutuusa kati nnali sikakasa nnyo
I knew that wasn’t the case	Nnali nkimanyi nti ekyo si bwe kyali
I am everywhere, but nowhere	Nze ndi buli wamu, naye nga sirina we
I don’t know, really.	Simanyi, ddala.
He wants his own image.	Ayagala ekifaananyi kye.
He is a man.	Ye musajja.
I can say that about myself	Ekyo nsobola okwogera ku nze
Nor anyone else for that matter.	Wadde omuntu omulala yenna ku nsonga eyo.
He had to be like.	Yalina okuba nga.
I will do that again.	Ekyo nja kuddamu okukikola.
I think he just likes to say that	Ndowooza ayagala nnyo okwogera ekyo kyokka
I just want a place	Njagala kifo kyokka
I love doing this	Kino njagala nnyo okukola
I wanted to know a lot of things	Nnali njagala okumanya ebintu bingi
I need to know what’s going on with you	Nnina okumanya ekigenda mu maaso naawe
I need to go home	Nze nneetaaga okudda eka
I think he is good	Ndowooza ye nnungi
Which we can do.	Kye tusobola okukola.
I knew he was my father	Namanya nti ye taata wange
Another one.	Omulala.
That is important to us.	Ekyo kikulu gye tuli.
Perhaps he was devastated.	Oboolyawo yali alina ekizibu ennyo.
He was young, he thought.	Yali muto, bwe yalowooza.
I needed a job and money	Nnali nneetaaga omulimu ne ssente
That he needed help.	Nti yali yeetaaga obuyambi.
It is actually my job.	Mu butuufu gwe mulimu gwange.
This is probably not what you want.	Kino osanga si ky’oyagala.
I just wanted to go home	Nnali njagala kudda waka kyokka
I feel like it is.	Mpulira nga bwe kiri.
This is both good and bad.	Kino kirungi era kibi.
I was in that group.	Nnali mu kibiina ekyo.
I think it’s a great idea	Ndowooza nti kirowoozo kirungi nnyo
It's easy for you.	Kyangu gy'oli.
This is a serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi.
I think that’s probably true.	Ndowooza osanga ekyo kituufu.
Everyone is talking about us, she thought.	Buli omu ayogera ku ffe, bwe yalowooza.
I am just a human being.	Nze ndi muntu yekka.
It’s not too bad.	Si kibi nnyo.
He couldn’t really play.	Mu butuufu yali tasobola kuzannya.
I'm not even sure what it was.	Sikakasa na kiki kye kyali.
But he needed to do it.	Naye yali yeetaaga okukikola.
And plenty of time.	Era obudde bungi.
I can’t say what it is	Siyinza kwogera kye kiri
I’m pretty good today	Nze leero ndi bulungi nnyo
He spoke a lot.	Yayogera nnyo.
Now there is plenty of time.	Kati waliwo obudde bungi.
I know this.	Kino nkimanyi.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
Getting to the point.	Okutuuka ku nsonga.
I am you, and you are me	Nze ggwe, naawe nze
That’s not the same thing.	Ekyo si kye kimu.
That was really good.	Ekyo kyali kirungi ddala.
But really no one knows.	Naye ddala tewali amanyi.
He just can’t have done it.	Ye yekka tayinza kuba nga yakola.
We were so close.	Twali tuli kumpi nnyo.
I didn’t know you were in town	Nnali simanyi nti oli mu kibuga
It’s great to get here.	Kirungi nnyo okutuuka wano.
He is what he is.	Ye ky’ali.
You know, probably not.	Omanyi, oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
In my opinion.	Mu ndowooza yange.
I love your opinion.	Njagala nnyo endowooza yo.
None except the problem .	Tewali okuggyako ekizibu .
I can’t speak fast enough	Sisobola kwogera mangu
And that, and that.	Era ekyo, era ekyo.
He said he didn't.	Yagambye nti nedda.
I can’t believe you were my teacher	Siyinza kukkiriza nti wali musomesa wange
I love to work	Njagala nnyo okukola
I need to get out of this room	Nze nneetaaga okuva mu kisenge kino
He was a human being.	Yali muntu.
We cannot know.	Tetusobola kumanya.
That won’t work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola.
However, I knew he was so much more than that	Kyokka nnali nkimanyi nti yali asinga nnyo ekyo
I need time to make plans	Nneetaaga obudde okukola enteekateeka
You have to do this.	Kino olina okukola.
But it’s not as simple as that.	Naye si kyangu nga ekyo.
I'm sure about that one.	Nkakasa ku oyo.
It will definitely come in a week.	Kijja kujja ddala mu wiiki emu.
I feel the same, like me	Nze mpulira kye kimu, nga nze
I didn’t know if that was good or bad	Nnali simanyi oba ekyo kyali kirungi oba kibi
Certainly there is.	Mazima ddala waliwo.
I have to get out of here	Nnina okuva wano
I thought he wouldn’t, that he was done with me.	Nalowooza nti tajja kukikola, nti yali amaze nange.
He just loves it so much.	Ayagala nnyo kyokka.
This thing is bad.	Ekintu kino kibi.
It's a good night.	Ekiro kirungi.
It was a very, very difficult time.	Kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo nnyo.
It seems a little obvious though.	Kirabika nga kya lwatu katono wadde.
I guess we’re friends, in a way.	Ntebereza nti tuli ba mukwano, mu ngeri emu.
He tried to see everything.	Yagezaako okulaba buli kimu.
I’m working, too.	Nze nange nkola.
I love spending time with you	Njagala nnyo okumala obudde naawe
And today is the day.	Era leero lwe lunaku.
No, my son.	Nedda mwana wange.
But it's so good!.	Naye kirungi nnyo!.
Not all of it, by any means.	Si byonna, mu ngeri yonna.
He always knows.	Bulijjo amanyi.
I could have done it before	Nnali nsobola okukikola emabegako
He was doing his job.	Yali akola omulimu gwe.
I needed a little time.	Nnali nneetaaga akaseera katono.
That is certainly true.	Ekyo mazima ddala kituufu.
As if it was real.	Nga bwe kiri nti kyali kya ddala.
I knew he probably had been	Namanya nti osanga yali abadde
I don’t know now.	Simanyi kati.
That way everything goes on as normal.	Mu ngeri eyo buli kimu kigenda mu maaso nga kya bulijjo.
He needed a plan, he thought, a plan.	Yali yeetaaga enteekateeka, yalowooza, enteekateeka.
You have a point.	Ggwe olina ensonga.
I thought that was a good thing	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kintu kirungi
But this is not true.	Naye kino si kituufu.
I will do this myself	Kino nja kukikola nzekka
She was very, very young and very beautiful.	Yali muto nnyo nnyo era nga mulungi nnyo.
I have to be ready tonight.	Nnina okuba nga mwetegefu ekiro kino.
I think you have to do that	Ndowooza ekyo olina okukikola
It was, you know.	Yali, omanyi.
You are so lucky.	Oli wa mukisa nnyo.
I can't see what the problem is from here	Sisobola kulaba buzibu ki okuva wano
I just want to be here with you	Njagala kubeera wano naawe kyokka
There is only me now.	Waliwo nze nzekka kati.
I really knew it.	Nze ddala nnali nkimanyi.
We can’t do anything right now.	Tetusobola kukola kintu kyonna mu kiseera kino.
I honestly didn’t know why it would matter	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi lwaki kyandibadde kikulu
I hope it’s for one person	Nsuubira nti ya muntu omu
I just couldn’t speak	Nnali sisobola kwogera kyokka
And it’s very hard to read.	Era kizibu nnyo okusoma.
And then now, he saw.	Era awo kati, yalaba.
It is in good condition.	Kiri mu mbeera nnungi.
But that won’t be enough.	Naye ekyo tekijja kumala.
In any case.	Mu ngeri yonna.
We’re going to do that again.	Ekyo tugenda kuddamu okukikola.
I could be everywhere	Nnyinza okuba nga ndi buli wamu
This is a terrible thing.	Kino kibi nnyo.
I don't even care.	Sifaayo wadde.
And it’s pretty good.	Era kirungi nnyo.
I'll talk to you soon	Nja kwogera naawe mu bbanga ttono
I was hoping to get those today	Nali nsuubira okufuna ebyo leero
I have no idea where it is.	Sirina kye mmanyi gye kiri.
I didn’t think it was that important	Nze nnali sirowooza nti kikulu nnyo
I was curious too	Nange nnali njagala okumanya
I need help with this.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi ku nsonga eno.
It was a little more complicated than that.	Kyali kizibu katono okusinga ekyo.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
I knew it, too.	Nange nnali nkimanyi.
I really need to go home	Nneetaaga nnyo okudda eka
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I can do things again	Nsobola okuddamu okukola ebintu
Not that it matters now, really.	Si nti kikulu kati, ddala.
I think that’s a good answer	Ndowooza ekyo kya kuddamu kirungi
I couldn’t believe my luck	Nali siyinza kukkiriza mukisa gwange
I’m not sure, but maybe.	Sikakasa, naye mpozzi.
But no, he was done.	Naye nedda, yali amaze.
I couldn’t wait to be alone	Nnali siyinza kulinda kubeera nzekka
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kirungi.
I know you would like that	Nkimanyi ekyo wandyagadde
Whatever it may be.	Kyonna kye kiyinza okuba.
And it’s hard to get here.	Era kizibu okutuuka wano.
No, it’s not that.	Nedda, si ekyo.
And that's it.	Era oyo.
I hope you will be there	Nsuubira nti ojja kubeerawo
I had no idea of ​​this.	Kino nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
It was certainly good, but that’s not me.	Mazima ddala kyali kirungi naye ekyo si nze.
He did something.	Waliwo kye yakola.
I wanted to go home already	Nnali njagala kudda waka dda
But apparently this should have been a long time ago.	Naye kirabika kino kyandibadde dda.
I’m here with him for a little while	Nze ndi wano naye okumala akaseera katono
Much less powerful	Katono nnyo okusinga amaanyi
It was him, and yet it wasn’t.	Yali ye, era naye si bwe kyali.
He was the one.	Ye yali oyo.
And he would work.	Era yandikoze.
He said, yes, of course.	Yagamba nti, ye, ddala.
It is indeed the case.	Ddala bwe kiri.
I didn’t know what to believe	Nnali simanyi kye nnyinza kukkiriza
I had nothing to fear	Nze nali sirina kye ntya
You can’t work.	Tosobola kukola.
I had no idea anyone else was here	Nali simanyi nti wano waliwo omuntu omulala yenna
The hard part is doing this.	Ekizibu okukola kino.
However, that will be difficult.	Kyokka, ekyo kijja kuba kizibu.
But it was better to move on quickly.	Naye kyali kirungi okugenda mu maaso mu bwangu.
And that’s what it is.	Era ekyo kye kiri.
I wonder where he was	Nze nneebuuza gye yali
And we can’t do it.	Era tetusobola kukikola.
I'm working.	Nze nkola.
But it seems important to me.	Naye kirabika nga kikulu gyendi.
However, he couldn’t do it.	Kyokka yali tasobola kukikola.
Can someone help??.	Omuntu asobola okuyamba??.
Everything looks great.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi nnyo.
I thought no one would know what it was	Nalowooza nti tewali ajja kumanya kye kyali
And you know it.	Era omanyi.
I really just wanted to talk to you	Mazima ddala nnali njagala kwogera naawe kyokka
Everyone is in this room.	Buli muntu ali mu kisenge kino.
I hope we’re going to be friends	Nsuubira nti tugenda kuba ba mukwano
And that’s happening right now.	Era ekyo kigenda mu maaso mu kiseera kino.
And that’s not me.	Era oyo si nze.
I am very well off	Nze ndi bulungi nnyo
But you are not.	Naye ggwe si bwe kiri.
At the same time.	Mu kiseera kye kimu.
He had no idea what.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku ki.
He could see very clearly.	Yali asobola okulaba obulungi ennyo.
That is a huge risk.	Ekyo kya bulabe bwa maanyi nnyo.
I had no choice	Nze nnali sirina kya kukola
It would be more powerful that way.	Kyandibadde kya maanyi nnyo mu ngeri eyo.
I couldn’t find anyone	Nnali sisobola kufuna muntu yenna
I have to go to school	Nnina okugenda ku ssomero
He was much closer than he thought.	Yali kumpi nnyo okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
He is still my child.	Akyali mwana wange.
This is your plan.	Enteekateeka yo eno.
I think it was him	Ndowooza yali ye
There is only you.	Waliwo ggwe wekka.
And it’s very easy.	Era kyangu nnyo.
Really, nothing.	Ddala, tewali kintu kyonna.
Not just for me, but for anyone.	Si nze nzekka, naye eri omuntu yenna.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
I am so ready to leave this place	Ndi mwetegefu nnyo okuva mu kifo kino
All very quickly.	Byonna mu bwangu nnyo.
I really don’t want to go back to the same office	Mazima ddala saagala kudda mu ofiisi emu
And you had this movie.	Era wali ne firimu eno.
I’m not here right now.	Siri wano mu kiseera kino.
I couldn’t believe what he was saying	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza bye yali ayogera
I can’t answer you or my father or anyone else	Sisobola kuddamu ggwe oba taata oba omuntu omulala yenna
I couldn’t see anything.	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
Unusual.	Si kya bulijjo.
I couldn’t believe he said that	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti yayogera bw’atyo
Not so much, my son.	Si nnyo mwana wange.
I’m not sure how strong a player he was.	Sikakasa muzannyi wa maanyi bwe yali.
That was the right thing to do.	Ekyo kyali kituufu.
I need some time alone to process everything	Nneetaaga akaseera nzekka okukola ku buli kimu
That's ' us.	Ekyo ' ffe.
I was in a good mood	Nnali mu mbeera nnungi
I can say the same thing about you now	Nze nsobola okwogera ekintu kye kimu ku ggwe kati
He wants to go home again.	Ayagala kuddamu kudda waka.
I couldn’t wait much longer	Nnali sisobola kulinda bbanga ddene
That's like me.	Oyo nga nze.
I was the lowest of the low	Nze nnali asinga wansi mu ba wansi
I’m working here.	Nze nkola wano.
He knew who he was.	Yali amanyi ky’ali.
I couldn’t believe it was real	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti kyali kya ddala
I am very, very happy	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nnyo
I work hard on this thing, you know	Nkola nnyo ku kintu kino, omanyi
I have a plan for that, though.	Kyokka ekyo nnina enteekateeka.
He was anywhere.	Yali yenna.
That was it.	Ekyo kyali.
You will preach.	Ojja kubuulira.
I suppose, he was too good for me	Nsuubira, yali mulungi nnyo gyendi
He was what she needed.	Ye yali kye yali yeetaaga.
I have a job to do here	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola wano
I have no idea how I do that.	Sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri gye nkola ekyo.
Now we are one.	Kati tuli kimu.
I was feeling too sick to go	Nali mpulira nga ndi mulwadde nnyo nga sisobola kugenda
It’s really easy.	Kyangu ddala.
But, I hope it comes soon.	Naye, nsuubira nti kijja kujja mu bbanga ttono.
It’s just simple and powerful.	Kyangu kyokka era kya maanyi.
It’s not realistic.	Si kya ddala.
I wanted to be him again	Nnali njagala kuddamu kubeera ye
To do something.	Okukola ekintu.
We are.	Ffe tuli.
I want to do my job	Njagala kukola mulimu gwange
I’m going anyway.	Nze ngenda mu ngeri yonna.
I know this though	Kino nkimanyi wadde
But he does do so.	Naye akola bw’atyo.
I am now a woman.	Nze kati ndi mukyala.
It’s not a good idea.	Si kirowoozo kirungi.
It’s not about finding an answer.	Si kya kufuna kya kuddamu.
Police than usual.	Poliisi okusinga bulijjo.
I’m the only one who knows.	Nze nzekka amanyi.
I didn't think it would happen tonight, though	Kyokka nnali sirowooza nti kijja kubaawo ekiro kino
I was powerless	Nze nali sirina maanyi
I can’t wait much longer	Siyinza kulinda nnyo
We’re going to be here for a little while.	Tugenda kubeera wano akaseera katono.
I like to do it this way.	Njagala nnyo okukikola mu ngeri eno.
For me, the average person has nowhere on his agenda	Nze omuntu wa bulijjo talina we ku agenda ye
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mulungi nnyo.
I didn’t know where he lived	Nali simanyi gye yali abeera
I have a problem though.	Nnina ekizibu wadde.
I know exactly where you are	Nze mmanyi bulungi gyoli
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
This will not address this issue.	Kino tekijja kukola ku nsonga eno.
I have one too.	Nange nnina emu.
The plan was complete.	Enteekateeka yali ewedde.
It’s not a bad place.	Si kifo kibi.
I’m sorry, but it is.	Nsonyiwa naye bwe kiri.
I wanted to be ready.	Nnali njagala kubeera mwetegefu.
Not who did it.	Si ani yakola.
Or any issue.	Oba ensonga yonna.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
He certainly doesn’t go down in that.	Mazima ddala tagenda wansi mu ekyo.
It goes to me.	Kigenda gyendi.
I’m feeling something	Nze nnina kye mpulira
I know what he wants too.	Nze nange mmanyi ky’ayagala.
I want to know what it is	Njagala okumanya kye kiri
What a person needs.	Omuntu kye yeetaaga.
I don’t want to do that.	Ekyo saagala kukikola.
It is much worse than that.	Kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He was busy.	Yali bbize.
Everyone but him.	Buli muntu okuggyako ye.
I think everyone loves food	Ndowooza buli muntu ayagala nnyo emmere
I can’t wait to be her friend	Siyinza kulinda kubeera mukwano gwe
I don’t want to talk to you.	Saagala kwogera naawe.
This was here, now.	Kino kyali wano, kati.
No one was coming.	Tewali yali ajja.
That’s almost true.	Ekyo kumpi kituufu.
I hope you might as well	Nsuubira nti oyinza nga bwe kiri
He doesn’t have a problem.	Talina buzibu.
Not any kind of relationship or nothing like that.	Si mukwano gwa ngeri yonna oba tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
That was a terrible thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi nnyo.
I will do this tonight.	Kino nja kukikola ekiro kino.
He did the only thing he could do.	Yakola ekintu kyokka kye yali asobola okukola.
As it may be.	Nga bwe kiyinza okubeera.
I feel really lucky that way.	Mpulira nga ddala ndi wa mukisa mu ngeri eyo.
It’s going to be dangerous.	Kigenda kuba kya bulabe.
However, he could not do that.	Kyokka, ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
Who knows.	Ani amanyi.
Nothing like that here.	Tewali kintu nga ekyo wano.
I guess he has a point.	Ntebereza nti alina ensonga.
He was so young and so vulnerable.	Yali muto nnyo era nga yali mu bulabe nnyo.
We were in this place.	Twali mu kifo kino.
I can hardly see a thing	Nze sisobola bulungi kulaba kintu
It doesn’t seem to be true.	Kirabika si kituufu.
I didn’t think it would work	Nnali sirowooza nti kijja kukola
He really is something.	Ddala ye kintu.
He didn't know how.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ki.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
I want to be a good man	Njagala kubeera musajja mulungi
And that he’s not alone.	Era nti si ye yekka.
You’ll see.	Ojja kulaba.
We have three dogs.	Tulina embwa ssatu.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
You know you can’t.	Omanyi nti tosobola.
No one said anything.	Tewali yayogera kintu kyonna.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
I want to talk about this	Njagala kwogera ku nsonga eno
But not for everyone.	Naye si lwa buli muntu.
I know that everything will be fine	Nkimanyi nti buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi
I want to work for a while	Njagala okukola akaseera
I’ll come back to you	Nja kudda gy’oli
I’m sorry to see you go	Nsonyiwa okulaba nga ogenda
In this, he may have been optimistic.	Mu kino, ayinza okuba nga yalina essuubi.
I didn’t know where we were	Nali simanyi gye tuli
I'm not sure why though.	Sikakasa lwaki wadde.
I highly doubt he will	Nbuusabuusa nnyo nti ajja kukikola
However, not here.	Kyokka si wano.
And that's why it was so hard to do.	Era y'ensonga lwaki kyali kizibu nnyo okukola.
You’re going to make it home to me.	Ogenda kukikola okudda eka gyendi.
I still couldn’t tell	N’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kumanya
You can do whatever you want to do.	Osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala okukola.
I wish it was me	Njagala nnyo singa kyali nze
He wasn’t much.	Yali si nnyo.
I have certainly been fine for a while	Mazima ddala mbadde bulungi okumala akaseera
You might as well.	Naawe oyinza okuba nga.
That’s true for everyone.	Ekyo kituufu eri buli muntu.
I needed to know he was safe	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya nti yali talina bulabe
I didn’t know anything	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi
I had no plan, nowhere to go	Nnali sirina nteekateeka yonna, nga sirina gye nnali ngenda
We are in the right.	Tuli mu butuufu.
I can help with that.	Nsobola okuyamba ku ekyo.
I think we have to talk	Ndowooza tulina okwogera
You know you can do the job.	Omanyi nti osobola okukola omulimu.
You continue at home.	Ggwe ogenda mu maaso awaka.
This is the reason for that.	Eno y’ensonga eyo.
He is my boyfriend.	Ye muganzi wange.
I knew why, of course	Nali mmanyi lwaki, ddala
Everyone will know it’s not true.	Buli omu ajja kumanya nti si kituufu.
I am just one person.	Nze ndi muntu omu yekka.
I was wondering if you were busy this weekend	Nali nneebuuza oba wiikendi eno wali bbize
I really need to talk to you	Nze ddala nneetaaga okwogera naawe
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
There is nowhere to go.	Tewali wa kugenda.
I needed some time to think	Nnali nneetaaga akaseera okulowooza
I can’t wait to go to school	Siyinza kulinda kugenda ku ssomero
I couldn’t figure out how or why	Nnali sisobola kumanya ngeri ki oba lwaki
His job is to.	Omulimu gwe.
I thought that would be awkward	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyandibadde kya buzibu
You can help.	Osobola okuyamba.
Not in that way.	Si mu ngeri eyo.
I was very curious	Nnali njagala nnyo okumanya
When it is on the floor.	Nga eri wansi.
Maybe he didn’t know what he was doing.	Mpozzi yali tamanyi kye yali akola.
No one should be like that.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kubeera bw’atyo.
Until now.	Okutuusa kati.
That was very dangerous.	Ekyo kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
Despite everything .	Wadde nga buli kimu .
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
Everyone knows this.	Kino buli omu akimanyi.
Actually, no.	Mu butuufu, nedda.
It is very close.	Kiri kumpi nnyo.
I could go home	Nnali nsobola okudda eka
You do, you do well.	Okola, okola bulungi.
When.	Ddi.
It doesn’t matter what they are.	Si kikulu kiki kye bali.
I know he is telling the truth	Nkimanyi nti ayogera mazima
I can’t say much right now.	Siyinza kwogera bingi mu kiseera kino.
And that’s exactly what it was.	Era ekyo ddala kye kyali.
I hope you will come	Nsuubira nti ojja kujja
He doesn’t have to believe this.	Kino talina kukkiriza.
I knew what it looked like	Namanya bwe kyali kirabika
I will never be there again	Sijja kuddamu kubeerawo
I'm not sure why though.	Sikakasa lwaki wadde.
But it’s much more complicated than that.	Naye kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
Here it is, my son.	Wano mwana wange.
It’s not a person.	Si muntu.
Everyone was like him to me.	Buli omu yali nga ye gyendi.
It’s good to go.	Kirungi okugenda.
I had no plan, no idea, no hope	Nnali sirina nteekateeka, kirowoozo kyonna, wadde essuubi
That’s a lot of it.	Ebyo bingi nnyo.
Whatever you want.	Kyonna ky’oyagala.
It looks really good.	Kirabika bulungi ddala.
I hope it is the same for me.	Nsuubira nti nange bwe kiri.
He is the only one who can do it today.	Ye yekka asobola okukikola leero.
You don’t have to get the same thing.	Tolina kufuna kintu kye kimu.
Not strong, not nearly as strong as I am.	Si wa maanyi, si kumpi wa maanyi nga nze.
I thought it didn’t matter	Nnalowooza nti si kikulu
I don’t know why.	Simanyi lwaki.
But nothing of the sort.	Naye tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo.
It would be very difficult for them.	Kyandibadde kizibu nnyo gye bali.
But you know.	Naye omanyi.
And it looks great, too.	Era kirabika bulungi nnyo, era.
He had been here before.	Yali abadde wano emabegako.
I’m a man of opinion.	Nze ndi musajja wa ndowooza.
I know you would love it.	Nkimanyi nti wandyagadde nnyo.
I’m good with these.	Nze ndi mulungi ne bino.
In a sense, he had been telling the truth.	Mu ngeri emu, yali abadde ayogera mazima.
She says no, everything is fine.	Agamba nti nedda, buli kimu kiri bulungi.
I'm glad you're here, now	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano, kati
But there was only that one.	Naye nga waliwo oyo yekka.
He couldn’t do that.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
I want something.	Njagala ekintu.
Maybe nothing.	Mpozzi tewali kintu kyonna.
It's as good a place as any.	Kifo kirungi nga kyonna.
I was ready to work	Nnali mwetegefu okukola
It would have been easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu.
But it seems important.	Naye kirabika kikulu.
I know what we have is real	Nkimanyi kye tulina kya ddala
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
I can’t live without you	Siyinza kubeerawo nga tolina ggwe
And that’s not a good strategy.	Era eyo si nkola nnungi.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
My friend is like that	Mukwano gwange bw’atyo
They're there.	Bali awo.
I want a chance to get my wife back.	Njagala omukisa okuddamu okufuna mukyala wange.
Like a dog.	Nga embwa.
He thought his wife looked good.	Yalowooza nti mukyala we alabika bulungi.
I think that’s great, being in this industry.	Ndowooza ekyo kirungi nnyo, okubeera mu mulimu guno.
I’m glad it was real at the time	Ndi musanyufu nti kyali kya ddala mu kiseera ekyo
I need to do that	Ekyo nneetaaga okukikola
It was a lot of money.	Yali ssente nnyingi nnyo.
You can imagine how he looked to me.	Oyinza okulowooza ku ngeri gye yalabika gyendi.
And mostly you.	Era okusinga ggwe.
Day in and day out.	Olunaku ku lunaku.
The reason for everything	Ensonga lwaki buli kimu
No one wanted to.	Tewali yali ayagala.
But he still has no friends.	Naye n’okutuusa kati talina mikwano.
And it is, for a while.	Era bwe kiri, okumala akaseera.
Really, that’s what it is.	Ddala, ekyo kye kiri.
This is just not realistic.	Kino kyokka si kya ddala.
I needed to think and quickly	Nnali nneetaaga okulowooza era mu bwangu
We are here to make money.	Tuli wano okukola ssente.
But at the time, it was all he could do.	Naye mu kiseera ekyo, kye kyokka kye yali asobola okukola.
But no, he wanted to play with me.	Naye nedda, yali ayagala kuzannya nange.
I want to do it for you	Njagala okukikola gy’oli
He was at my wedding.	Yali mu mbaga yange.
I loved it, as did he	Nze nnali njagala nnyo, nga naye bwe yakola
I’m going to be sick	Ngenda kubeera mulwadde
I think he knew that	Ndowooza ekyo yali akimanyi
That would be something to talk about at work, he knew.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu kya kwogera ku mulimu, yali akimanyi.
I want to talk to my wife now	Njagala okwogera ne mukyala wange kati
I have to get back to work.	Nnina okudda ku mulimu.
I was fine as a kid.	Nnali bulungi nnyo nga ndi mwana muto.
I can’t wait to be home	Siyinza kulinda kubeera waka
This looks great.	Kino kirabika bulungi nnyo.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
He had to take a picture.	Yalina okukuba ekifaananyi.
I had no idea of ​​this	Kino nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna
You have the money.	Olina ssente.
Obviously, this is a problem.	Kya lwatu nti kino kizibu.
I was happy and he wasn’t	Nali musanyufu era naye si bwe yali
I will live with this every day	Nja kubeera na kino buli lunaku
I just don’t want anything.	Nze sirina kye njagala kyokka.
I love how it looks.	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kirabika.
I couldn’t talk to him	Nnali sisobola kwogera naye
I don’t have time for this	Kino sirina budde
As he should have been.	Nga bwe yandibadde.
This he had.	Kino yalina.
I would love to talk to you	Njagala nnyo okwogera naawe
He knows this.	Kino akimanyi.
And this is a good thing.	Era kino kintu kirungi.
I didn’t know and didn’t care what he thought	Nali simanyi era nga sifaayo ku kye yali alowooza
I don’t want to come here	Saagala kujja wano
I doubt he needs much help	Nbuusabuusa nti yeetaaga obuyambi bungi
I want to know	Njagala kumanya
Dad, but not my dad.	Taata, naye si taata wange.
I thought the same thing a while back	Nalowooza ekintu kye kimu akaseera emabega
I have three now.	Nnina ssatu kati.
I work very, very hard.	Nkola nnyo nnyo.
I can see his reasons	Nsobola okulaba ensonga ze
That’s what’s important.	Ekyo kye kikulu.
But it’s not just this.	Naye si kino kyokka.
He wouldn’t have been able to do it.	Yandibadde tasobola kukikola.
I hope dinner is available soon	Nsuubira nti ekyeggulo kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono
Indeed, he said.	Mazima ddala, bwe yagambye.
He’s not young and he’s not human.	Si muto era si muntu.
This looks great.	Kino kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He's just a kid.	Ye mwana muto yekka.
But he was my friend.	Naye yali mukwano gwange.
To say the least.	Okugamba nti.
Nothing really except this.	Tewali ddala okuggyako kino.
He couldn’t see anything.	Yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
He was finished.	Yali amaze.
I thought his personality probably was	Nalowooza nti omuntu we osanga bwe yali
And there was something.	Era nga waliwo ekintu.
I am absolutely fine.	Ndi bulungi ddala.
And certainly the reason.	Era mazima ddala ensonga.
He was going to be my son.	Yali agenda kubeera mwana wange.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
Now I am happy to have him here	Kati ndi musanyufu okubeera naye wano
I think he wants you	Ndowooza ayagala ggwe
I’m going to do the same thing	Nze ngenda kukola ekintu kye kimu
He is just so good.	Ye mulungi nnyo kyokka.
I’m so scared.	Nze ntya nnyo.
And now you are so good to me.	Era kati oli mulungi nnyo gyendi.
I almost feel like a friend	Kumpi mpulira nga mukwano gwange
I was thinking, if you know.	Nali ndowooza, singa oba omanyi.
But there is no police.	Naye tewali poliisi.
I wanted that child.	Nnali njagala mwana oyo.
Maybe there was something he could find.	Mpozzi nga waliwo kye yali asobola okufuna.
I guess that’s a really bad thing	Ntebereza nti ekyo kintu kibi nnyo ddala
I have to know where you are all the time	Nnina okumanya gy’oli buli kiseera
You either are or you are not.	Ggwe oba oli oba toli.
I wanted to see where it went	Nnali njagala kulaba gye kigenda
I still have no idea where he went	N’okutuusa kati sirina kye mmanyi gye yagenda
Now, you do it.	Kati, ggwe okola.
Don't know who might have, either.	Tomanyi ani ayinza okuba nga yalina, era.
It’s a good thing.	Kintu kirungi.
I am not alone in that opinion	Si nze nzekka mu ndowooza eyo
Maybe you will.	Mpozzi ojja kukikola.
You don’t belong in this place.	Toli wa mu kifo kino.
More than you.	Okusinga ggwe.
I guess that’s true	Ntebereza nti ekyo kituufu
He had been so happy.	Yali abadde musanyufu nnyo.
But he didn’t know.	Naye yali tamanyi.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
I didn’t know what to say.	Nali simanyi kya kwogera.
Easy for the teacher.	Kyangu ku musomesa.
And they were very close.	Era baali bali kumpi nnyo.
I want to be a teacher.	Njagala kubeera musomesa.
I just want to make sure he’s okay	Njagala kulaba kyokka nti ali bulungi
I wanted to say all these things but I couldn’t	Nali njagala okwogera ebintu bino byonna naye nga sisobola
That’s going to be true.	Ekyo kigenda kuba kituufu.
And that was actually something important to the person.	Era mu butuufu ekyo kyali kintu kikulu eri omuntu oyo.
He looked like that.	Yalabika bw’atyo.
I know we’re not best friends	Nkimanyi nti si tuli ba mukwano nnyo
I wanted to be alone	Nnali njagala kubeera nzekka
I can’t go to school	Sisobola kugenda ku ssomero
I know not everyone shares that view.	Nkimanyi nti si buli muntu nti alina endowooza eyo.
He is a young child.	Ye mwana muto.
However, I still can’t go home	Kyokka n’okutuusa kati sisobola kudda waka
I loved that book.	Ekitabo ekyo nnali njagala nnyo.
He knows that.	Ekyo akimanyi.
I would love to see that.	Njagala nnyo okulaba ekyo.
I honestly didn’t think he was here	Mu butuufu nnali sirowooza nti yali wano
You have to do the same thing.	Naawe olina okukola ekintu kye kimu.
What did he do.	Yakola ki.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
This was the same thing.	Kino kyali kye kimu.
Was in there for something like an hour.	Yali mu eyo okumala ekintu nga essaawa emu.
I won’t go to one	Sijja kugenda ku emu
There is nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna.
I think it’s a matter of perspective	Ndowooza nsonga ya ndowooza
However, I could not find that one answer	Kyokka, nnali sisobola kufuna kya kuddamu ekyo kimu
I just want to know everything, now	Njagala kumanya buli kimu kyokka, kati
I have to think about both of us.	Nnina okulowooza ku ffembi.
I was always in trouble	Bulijjo nnali mu buzibu
Everything was easy.	Buli kimu kyali kyangu.
I am not sure how this is happening.	Sikakasa ngeri ki kino gye kigenda mu maaso.
However, I know this.	Kyokka kino nkimanyi.
I can’t believe it myself	Nze kennyini sisobola kukkiriza
He couldn't answer.	Yali tasobola kuddamu.
We are very sick.	Tuli mulwadde nnyo.
He can be with her.	Asobola okuba naye.
I wanted to do this before, but didn’t know how.	Kino nnali njagala okukikola emabegako, naye nga simanyi ngeri ki.
I was definitely not well.	Mazima ddala nali siri bulungi.
He works with me.	Akola nange.
I thought he could do it.	Nalowooza nti asobola okukikola.
I knew he was gone, that's all	Namanya nti yagenda, ekyo kyokka
And what it is, is this.	Era kye kiri, kye kino.
He needed to make a call.	Yali yeetaaga okukuba essimu.
A really long time ago	Ddala ebbanga ddene emabega
I thought he worked in an office	Nalowooza nti akola mu ofiisi
But that’s not really what it was.	Naye ekyo si kye kyali ddala.
He is not in every thought.	Tali mu buli kirowoozo.
He didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala.
He is a very good player.	Muzannyi mulungi nnyo.
As in, at the moment.	Nga mu, mu kiseera kino.
He had me.	Yalina nze.
I was terrified of that	Ekyo nnali ntya nnyo
I loved it so much!.	Nnali njagala nnyo!.
I didn’t know what all that was	Ebyo byonna nnali simanyi ki
You are so much more than that.	Oli nnyo okusinga ekyo.
But she was anything but good.	Naye yali kintu kyonna okuggyako obulungi.
I need to know what’s going on	Nnina okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
Everyone is an artist.	Buli muntu muyimbi.
I had no choice in the matter.	Nnali sirina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo.
He seems happy there.	Kirabika nga musanyufu eyo.
I'm not sure why it won't work.	Sikakasa lwaki tekijja kukola.
He knew he had to act quickly.	Yali akimanyi nti alina okukola amangu.
Actually, this is not the case.	Mu butuufu, kino si bwe kiri.
I love that he is real with me	Njagala nnyo nti wa ddala nange
It’s hard to say.	Kizibu okwogera.
I knew he was happy	Namanya nti yali musanyufu
He does a very good job.	Akola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
But apparently it was.	Naye kirabika bwe kyali.
It’s a very good point.	Ensonga nnungi nnyo.
It was a difficult time.	Kyali kiseera kya buzibu.
Anything you want is.	Ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala kiri.
And who knows, she thought.	Era ani amanyi, bwe yalowooza.
No, it’s pretty good.	Nedda, kirungi nnyo.
I feel like this is my time right now	Mpulira nga kino kye kiseera kyange mu kiseera kino
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
Basically.	Mu bwangu.
I knew this movie would do this.	Nali mmanyi nti firimu eno yandikoze kino.
I am now feeling it.	Nze kati mpulira.
I need to get back in my place	Nze nneetaaga okudda mu kifo kyange
I didn’t even know how to respond	Nnali simanyi na ngeri ya kuddamu
There is so much help there.	Waliwo obuyambi bungi nnyo eyo.
I can’t go back down	Sisobola kudda wansi
Not as bad as.	Si kibi nga...
I think it looks good	Ndowooza kirabika bulungi
There are.	Waliwo e.
However, he did.	Kyokka, yakikola.
But he was my friend	Naye yali mukwano gwange
I thought you would come to my place.	Nalowooza nti ojja kujja mu kifo kyange.
No, it is not.	Nedda si bwe kiri.
It can be powerful.	Kiyinza okuba nga kya maanyi.
I hope you can do it	Nsuubira nti osobola okukikola
I think he knows where this is going.	Ndowooza kino akimanyi gye kigenda.
I know, it’s true.	Nkimanyi, kituufu.
I was busy this morning too	Nange enkya ya leero nnali bbize
He wanted everything just right.	Yali ayagala buli kimu kituufu ddala.
I can’t see normally	Sisobola kulaba mu ngeri ya bulijjo
Or, maybe even a week.	Oba, mpozzi ne wiiki emu.
I want to be the other me	Njagala kubeera nze omulala
I am in a very good mood	Ndi mu mbeera nnungi nnyo
A very complex picture.	Ekifaananyi ekizibu ennyo.
This is true of all of us.	Kino kituufu ku ffe ffenna.
That might just be me.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga nze nzekka.
I knew he would	Nali nkimanyi nti ajja kukikola
Maybe it’s not.	Mpozzi si bwe kiri.
But he couldn't speak.	Naye yali tasobola kwogera.
I think he is very good	Ndowooza mulungi nnyo
Obviously, it is.	Kya lwatu nti bwe kiri.
You are important to us.	Ggwe kikulu gye tuli.
I always knew what was going on	Bulijjo nnali mmanyi ekigenda mu maaso
I didn’t know what you were thinking	Nze nali simanyi kye wali olowooza
I’m glad he does	Ndi musanyufu nti akola bw’atyo
I thought it would already be here	Nalowooza nti kyandibadde dda wano
I am in the hospital	Ndi mu ddwaaliro
I have to go to them	Nnina okugenda gye bali
Nothing is visible here.	Tewali kye kirabika wano.
He was just an ordinary person.	Yali muntu wa bulijjo yekka.
Everything was fine with you.	Naawe buli kimu kyali kirungi.
I don’t even know what to say about that one.	Simanyi na kya kwogera ku oyo.
I didn’t know the answer	Nnali simanyi kya kuddamu
We are in a good position.	Tuli mu mbeera nnungi.
I know this now.	Kino nkimanyi kati.
Early in the morning.	Ku makya ennyo.
He saw that he did not know what to say.	Yalaba nga tamanyi kya kwogera.
I need some money.	Nze nneetaaga ku ssente.
However, for a short time.	Kyokka, okumala akaseera katono.
One of us has to go	Omu ku ffe alina okugenda
I haven't been to the doctor yet	Nze n'okutuusa kati sigenda wa musawo
I just knew it.	Nze nnali mmanyi kyokka.
I wasn’t strong at all	Nze nali siri wa maanyi n’akatono
The movie did a good job.	Firimu eno yakola omulimu mulungi.
I have to tell everyone something	Nnina okubuulira buli muntu ekintu
Everything was there.	Buli kimu kyali awo.
I will always be by his side	Bulijjo nja kuba ndi ku ludda lwe
I want to see that continue.	Njagala okulaba ng’ekyo kigenda mu maaso.
No one was talking about any of this.	Tewali yali ayogera ku kintu kyonna ku bino.
This will only be easier.	Kino kijja kuba kyangu kyokka.
Very beautiful to watch.	Mulungi nnyo okulaba.
Or was it.	Oba yali.
None of this seems real to me yet.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kirabika nga kya ddala gyendi n’okutuusa kati.
Soon, it’s time to go.	Mu bbanga ttono, kye kiseera okugenda.
I want to tap on something	Njagala okukuba ku kintu
I couldn’t do anything about him	Nali sirina kye nsobola kukola ku ye
I’m afraid it isn’t	Ntya nti si bwe kiri
You certainly are that.	Mazima ddala ggwe oli ekyo.
And you’re not alone.	Era si ggwe wekka.
He knew exactly what she was thinking.	Yali amanyi bulungi kye yali alowooza.
He must work.	Ateekwa okukola.
That was a good thing.	Ekyo kyali kirungi.
you think.	ggwe olowooza.
I don’t know much at all	Nze simanyi nnyo n’akatono
That’s not even to do.	Ekyo si kya wadde okukikola.
I have been really busy	Mbadde bbize ddala
You can't.	Tosobola.
No not really.	Nedda si ddala.
But there is so much more to driving than that.	Naye waliwo bingi nnyo mu kuvuga okusinga ekyo.
I’m sure we’re on there	Nkakasa nti tuli ku awo
That’s true of everyone, including you.	Ekyo kituufu ku buli muntu, ne ku ggwe.
I love being with you	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe
I knew this would happen.	Nali nkimanyi nti kino kijja kubaawo.
However, it looked great.	Kyokka, kyali kirabika bulungi nnyo.
I am so glad you are here!.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti oli wano!.
As much as he could.	Nga bwe yali asobola.
I think he wants to talk to you	Ndowooza ayagala kwogera naawe
I was always a loner	Bulijjo nnali mbeera muntu ali nzekka
As he did.	Nga bwe yakola.
In .	Mu .
I’m going with him in this.	Nze ngenda naye mu kino.
I wanted to say.	Nnali njagala okugamba.
They are there right now.	Bali awo mu kiseera kino.
I want him another of and friends	Njagala ye omulala wa ne mikwano
I have to do something.	Nnina okukola ekintu.
So far, it’s not.	N’okutuusa kati, si bwe kiri.
He is a good man.	Ye musajja mulungi.
I was wondering if you had.	Nali nneebuuza oba olina...
I guess that was great	Ntebereza nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo
I didn’t even know what was going on	Nali simanyi wadde ekigenda mu maaso
Now you’re working.	Kati ggwe okola.
I really didn’t know what to say	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kwogera
I have no money, no car, and no house	Sirina ssente, sirina mmotoka, era sirina nnyumba
You actually know better.	Mu butuufu ggwe omanyi bulungi.
I’m not sure it’s a good idea.	Sikakasa nti kirowoozo kirungi.
However, I have an opinion	Kyokka nnina endowooza
It had to be his money.	Yalina okuba ssente ze.
I will never do something like that again.	Sijja kuddamu kukola kintu ng’ekyo.
I’m sure you want to talk	Nkakasa nti oyagala kwogera
I would love to talk to you	Njagala nnyo okwogera naawe
I know you have to	Nkimanyi nti olina
I have to get back to work	Nnina okudda ku mulimu
But everyone does it.	Naye buli omu akikola.
However, I don’t know.	Kyokka simanyi.
And it is very true.	Era kituufu nnyo.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
I'll go.	Nja kugenda.
He was a young child.	Yali mwana muto.
I suppose it could happen	Nsuubira nti kiyinza okubaawo
I could do that too	Ekyo nange nnali nsobola okukikola
That’s not what’s going on here.	Ekyo si kye kigenda mu maaso wano.
You are just one with everyone.	Oli kimu kyokka ne buli muntu.
No, that wasn’t it.	Nedda, ekyo si kye kyali.
I just know it.	Nze mmanyi kyokka.
And it went on and on.	Era ne kugenda mu maaso.
I don’t know how to work.	Simanyi kukola.
I'm in trouble	Nze nfunye obuzibu
Not that that’s what he’d been doing, of course.	Si nti ekyo kye yali abadde akola, ddala.
It’s not entirely your business.	Si nsonga yo yonna.
Who is behind him.	Ani ali emabega we.
I have to tell someone.	Nnina okubuulira omuntu.
For a short time, however.	Kyokka okumala akaseera katono.
I need to go to school	Nze nneetaaga okugenda ku ssomero
We don’t have it.	Tetulina.
I could see the problem.	Nnali nsobola okulaba ekizibu.
In my own house.	Mu nnyumba yange.
He could do anything.	Yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
Clearly, that is not the case.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
In every room.	Mu buli kisenge.
We’ll just have to see.	Tugenda kumala kulaba.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
They were offices.	Baali ofiisi.
I won’t speak today	Sijja kwogera leero
I hope you’ll be very busy tomorrow	Nsuubira nti enkya ojja kuba bbize nnyo
I really don’t know what to do	Mazima ddala simanyi kya kukola
And here we are.	Era wano we tuli.
Read.	Okusoma.
This isn’t a bad thing.	Kino si kibi.
You would like to.	Wandyagadde.
He goes everywhere with me.	Agenda nange buli wamu.
He is a man.	Ye musajja.
I was hoping you’d want to work with me	Nali nsuubira nti ojja kwagala okukola nange
I would love to know where we are	Njagala nnyo okumanya gye tuli
He was so good at everything.	Yali mulungi nnyo mu buli kimu.
You just have to do it.	Olina okukikola kyokka.
I actually wanted to go with him	Mu butuufu nnali njagala kugenda naye
Myself and my wife.	Nze kennyini ne mukyala wange.
I have one of them	Nze nnina emu
It could be nothing.	Kiyinza okuba nga tewali kintu kyonna.
It’s not about me.	Si ku nze.
Dealing with the police.	Okukola ku poliisi.
But he was also.	Naye era ye yali.
We are real.	Tuli ba ddala.
I really need someone like you	Mazima ddala nneetaaga omuntu nga ggwe
I will never have a father again	Sijja kuddamu kufuna taata
He was very popular.	Yali muganzi nnyo.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
In a sense, he was too young himself.	Mu ngeri emu, ye kennyini yali muto nnyo.
He has no problem admitting this.	Kino talina buzibu kukkiriza.
Just like at home.	Nga bwe kiri awaka.
I’m sure you know that.	Nkakasa nti ekyo okimanyi.
One does not want .	Omuntu tayagala .
That’s a possibility.	Ekyo kiyinza okubaawo.
What's going on.	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
It was so close.	Yali kumpi nnyo.
I had nothing to say	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera
I wonder if that’s true	Nze nneebuuza oba ekyo kituufu
I feel good about it.	Mpulira nga kirungi okukikola.
He had .	Yalina .
That would be right.	Ekyo kyandibadde kituufu.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
This he didn't want to have to do this.	Kino yali tayagala kuba na kukola kino.
If	Si .
You there and still.	Ggwe awo n’okutuusa kati.
Not so apparently.	Si bwe kiri kirabika.
He is still very young.	Akyali muto nnyo.
I wasn’t sure if he knew	Nali sikakasa oba yali akimanyi
And he loves it that way.	Era ayagala nnyo bw’atyo.
It's just too bad.	Kibi nnyo kyokka.
I had no answer	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kuddamu
I think you would like it.	Ndowooza wandyagadde.
This is problematic for any system.	Kino kizibu ku nkola yonna.
He knows what I want.	Amanyi bye njagala.
I can’t wait on anyone	Siyinza kulinda ku muntu yenna
It’s not just what he is.	Si ky’ali kyokka.
When, he didn’t know.	Ddi, yali tamanyi.
I should get home.	Nsaanidde okutuuka awaka.
I love this movie.	Njagala nnyo firimu eno.
I know there is.	Nkimanyi nti waliwo.
That’s going on.	Ekyo kigenda mu maaso.
It was to be.	Kyali kya kubeera.
I have been very busy already this morning	Mbadde bbize nnyo dda enkya ya leero
It’s not your situation now.	Si mbeera yo kati.
We have to work.	Tulina okukola.
You're like anyone else now.	Oli nga omuntu omulala yenna kati.
I don’t want anyone to see what he did.	Saagala muntu yenna kulaba ekyo kye yakola.
Not for that reason.	Si lwa nsonga eyo.
I think this might be romantic	Ndowooza kino kiyinza okuba nga kya mukwano
He wanted to see what would happen.	Yali ayagala okulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
I will never do that again	Ekyo sijja kuddamu kukikola
I wondered what he was thinking	Nneebuuza kye yali alowooza
But in every case, it is no such thing.	Naye mu buli mbeera, si kintu ng’ekyo.
Maybe you’ll be able to do it.	Mpozzi ojja kusobola okukikola.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
I'm not exactly sure	Sikakasa bulungi ddala
We must move forward quickly.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso mu bwangu.
And that’s just fine.	Era ekyo kirungi kyokka.
Actually, it’s not a bad idea.	Mu butuufu, si kirowoozo kibi.
I know nothing about this problem	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kizibu kino
I want to be a normal person	Njagala kubeera muntu wa bulijjo
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
I could see clearly	Nnali nsobola okulaba obulungi
But he was my best friend.	Naye yali mukwano gwange nnyo.
He didn’t want to be here.	Yali tayagala kubeera wano.
No one knows about everything.	Tewali amanyi ku buli kimu.
I know they’re there	Nkimanyi nti bali awo
I don’t want to know	Saagala kumanya
Might be a little busy today.	Ayinza okuba nga bbize katono leero.
But that’s not my point.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga yange.
This is not that time.	Kino si kye kiseera ekyo.
It doesn’t matter if you have money or not.	Si kikulu oba olina oba tolina ssente.
He was really a good man.	Ddala yali musajja mulungi.
He should have thought of something like that.	Yandibadde alowooza ku kintu ng’ekyo.
And he had been.	Era yali abadde.
I had no choice but to back off	Nnali sirina kya kukola okuggyako okudda emabega
That’s what it is now.	Ekyo kye kiri kati.
We are in trouble.	Tuli mu buzibu.
It’s not my job.	Si mulimu gwange.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
I don’t think there is one.	Sirowooza nti waliwo emu.
You can do it too.	Naawe osobola.
I'm wondering.	Nze nneebuuza.
Like, the exact same thing.	Nga, ekintu kye kimu ddala.
I didn’t know it was happening	Nnali simanyi nti kigenda mu maaso
I have no idea what he was doing there	Sirina kye mmanyi kye yali akola eyo
No one spoke to him like that.	Tewali yayogera naye bw’atyo.
This is probably not the case.	Kino osanga si bwe kiri.
You won’t believe what he did.	Tojja kukkiriza kye yakola.
But it’s also true.	Naye era kituufu.
As much as that would matter.	Nga bwe kiri nti ekyo kyandibadde kikulu.
One can just do it.	Omuntu asobola okumala okukikola.
Here is a picture.	Wano waliwo ekifaananyi.
I’m willing to do it	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukikola
I just want him happy	Njagala musanyufu kyokka
You’re not happy.	Toli musanyufu.
Now he couldn't.	Kati yali tasobola.
However, I knew it wasn’t	Kyokka nnali nkimanyi nti si bwe kyali
I can’t do this	Kino sisobola kukikola
I have no idea what’s going on	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki ekigenda mu maaso
Every man except one.	Buli musajja okuggyako omu.
I wasn’t sure you would	Nali sikakasa nti ojja kukikola
There is something.	Waliwo ekintu.
It was dangerous to his person.	Kyali kya bulabe eri omuntu we.
I go to every class	Ngenda mu buli kibiina
That's what it is, he said.	Ekyo kye kiri, bwe yagambye.
He needed to get out of town.	Yali yeetaaga okuva mu kibuga.
Thus it is not the case here.	Bw’atyo si bwe kiri wano.
You can, and you should.	Osobola, era olina.
I thought it was true	Nnalowooza nti kituufu
It was just very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo kyokka kizibu nnyo.
And now he is not so in himself.	Era kati tali bw’atyo mu ye.
I always wanted a dog	Bulijjo nnali njagala embwa
Now I am fine at school.	Kati ndi bulungi ku ssomero.
More than they are now.	Okusinga bwe bali kati.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
I wish you were there	Njagala nnyo singa wali awo
I couldn’t have tried harder	Nnali siyinza kugezaako nnyo okusinga ekyo
He didn’t want this.	Kino yali tayagala.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
And he won’t do it.	Era tajja kukikola.
I hoped she would like it	Nali nsuubira nti yandiyagadde
I know you already know that	Nkimanyi ekyo okimanyi dda
I guess you have a point	Ntebereza nti olina ensonga
Maybe he didn’t really want to.	Mpozzi nga mu butuufu yali tayagala.
You don’t even know how bad it was.	Tomanyi na ngeri gye kyali kibi.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
I couldn’t go home	Nnali sisobola kudda waka
There is only one problem.	Ekizibu kimu kyokka.
You know my job.	Omanyi omulimu gwange.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
It's just there.	Kiri awo kyokka.
And no one for a very long time.	Era nga tewali muntu yenna okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
I didn’t know he was in town	Nze nali simanyi nti ali mu kibuga
I have no idea what this is	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kino kiki
I don’t know who it is.	Simanyi ani.
I know a lot about this	Kino nkimanyi bingi
I want to keep feeling.	Njagala kusigala nga mpulira.
I wanted to be with him	Nnali njagala kubeera naye
He needed money.	Yali yeetaaga ssente.
Probably not, but you might get lucky.	Oboolyawo si bwe kiri, naye oyinza okufuna omukisa.
I have money, lots of money	Nnina ssente, ssente nnyingi
And, you can do it.	Era, osobola okukikola.
But not with me.	Naye si nange.
Surely, today is not the day.	Mazima ddala, leero si lwe lunaku.
I was afraid of everything	Buli kimu nnali ntya
I was young and.	Nnali muto era...
I needed to read.	Nnali nneetaaga okusoma.
You can have everything you want.	Osobola okuba ne buli ky’oyagala.
I thought he was friendly	Nalowooza nti yali wa mukwano
I want here from him	Njagala wano okuva naye
Apparently, his father did those things.	Kirabika taata we yali akola ebintu ebyo.
I am nothing and everything.	Nze siri kintu era buli kimu.
There .	Awo .
I just hope we can.	Nsuubira kyokka nti tusobola.
I really can’t do this right now	Mazima ddala kino sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino
We are all vulnerable.	Ffenna tuli mu bulabe.
I can’t find anything	Sisobola kufuna kintu kyonna
That doesn’t matter.	Ekyo si nsonga.
The clock started ticking.	Essaawa yatandika okukuba.
I don’t want to.	Nze saagala.
I don’t know what to say.	Simanyi kya kwogera.
It won’t help.	Tekijja kuyamba.
Everyone has that.	Buli muntu alina ekyo.
I didn’t know anyone with a dog	Nnali simanyi muntu yenna alina embwa
He was beautiful.	Yali mulungi.
I’m fine, she said.	Nze ndi bulungi, bwe yagamba.
And that was the problem.	Era ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
I can't 'do it.	Sisobola 'kukikola.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
One need only go to this place.	Omuntu yeetaaga kugenda mu kifo kino kyokka.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
We are in this together.	Tuli mu kino nga tuli wamu.
I thought it was what he wanted	Nalowooza nti kye yali ayagala
We are friends.	Tuli ba mukwano.
I am sure this is not my time	Nkakasa nti kino si kye kiseera kyange
There is no issue here.	Wano tewali nsonga yonna.
I feel really good.	Mpulira ddala bulungi.
You can’t either.	Naawe tosobola.
I don’t think that will be a problem, but you never know.	Sirowooza nti ekyo kijja kuba kizibu naye tomanyi.
I just wonder if that is true	Nze nneebuuza kyokka oba ekyo kituufu
He is home to me.	Ali waka gyendi.
But in this case, it is.	Naye mu mbeera eno, bwe kiri.
I was fine with it.	Nze nali bulungi.
I don’t care about anything right now.	Sifaayo ku kintu kyonna mu kiseera kino.
I don’t think this is the case	Sirowooza nti kino bwe kiri
So he did the only thing he knew how to do.	Bwatyo yakola ekintu kyokka kye yali amanyi okukola.
That is very powerful.	Ekyo kya maanyi nnyo.
I still have no idea.	Nze n’okutuusa kati sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
I think it looks great	Ndowooza kirabika bulungi nnyo
I know you want that too	Nkimanyi naawe ekyo oyagala
He thought about where they were now.	Yalowooza ku kifo we bali kati.
But he knew what was going on.	Naye yali amanyi ekigenda mu maaso.
I want no man.	Nze njagala tewali musajja.
I don’t want to see anyone	Saagala kulaba muntu yenna
It may already be.	Kiyinza okuba nga kyali dda.
I knew it was you.	Namanya nti ggwe.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
I am now stronger.	Nze kati ndi wa maanyi.
Now, you better have one too.	Kati, kirungi naawe olina emu.
Probably many weeks.	Oboolyawo wiiki nnyingi.
I can’t believe this	Kino siyinza kukkiriza
He did the only thing he could.	Yakola ekintu kyokka kye yali asobola.
He knows that.	Ekyo akimanyi.
In reality this is not the case.	Mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
I am with the police too.	Nange ndi ne poliisi.
I’ve been wanting to say that	Nze mbadde njagala okwogera ekyo
I have money, lots of money	Nnina ssente, ssente nnyingi nnyo
Difficult to do.	Ekizibu okukola.
And then he was everywhere.	Era awo yali buli wamu.
No chance of winning.	Tewali mukisa gwa kuwangula.
Everything is perfectly fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi ddala.
There is no problem here.	Wano tewali buzibu.
No one knew where he lived.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yali abeera.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
I think he always has	Ndowooza bulijjo alina
He was a very busy man.	Yali musajja bbize nnyo.
He's not going to do anything about this.	Kino tagenda kukola kintu kyonna.
You have to know.	Olina okumanya.
Everyone I could make food	Buli omu nnali nsobola okukola emmere
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I don’t want to know.	Saagala kumanya.
I said it would be in his best interest	Nagamba nti kyandibadde mu bulungi bwe
I was down on my luck	Nali wansi ku mukisa gwange
I want to see that man.	Njagala kulaba musajja oyo.
Maybe he thought it was you.	Mpozzi yalowooza nti ye ggwe.
You’re going to wait here.	Ogenda kulinda wano.
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
But this was normal.	Naye kino kyali kya bulijjo.
Everyone is not like me.	Buli muntu si nga nze.
I couldn’t let it happen.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
I would love to talk to you	Njagala nnyo okwogera naawe
I wanted to be with him tonight	Nnali njagala kubeera naye ekiro kino
It comes very quickly.	Kijja mangu nnyo.
I couldn’t speak or think	Nnali sisobola kwogera wadde okulowooza
It was a beautiful place at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
Not mine, though.	Si yange, naye.
Everything and nothing.	Buli kimu era tewali kintu kyonna.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo yakikola.
I thought you looked good	Nze nalowooza nti olabika bulungi
I didn’t know there was such a thing	Nnali simanyi nti waliwo ekintu ng’ekyo
There is nothing for you whatsoever.	Tewali kintu kyonna gyoli kyonna.
I always wanted to do that	Bulijjo nnali njagala okukola ekyo
From there it was pretty easy.	Okuva awo kyali kyangu nnyo.
Nothing too bad.	Tewali kibi nnyo.
That’s what everyone did.	Ekyo buli omu kye yakola.
Everything was happening the way it should have happened.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda mu maaso mu ngeri gye kyandibadde kigenda mu maaso.
As I love to say.	Nga bwe njagala ennyo okwogera.
And he couldn't do anything about it.	Era yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
When, of course.	Ddi, ddala.
I know you know who he is	Nkimanyi nti omanyi ky’ali
I needed this to go	Kino nnali nneetaaga okugenda
Not as bad as you though.	Si kibi nga ggwe wadde.
I could do that myself.	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola nze kennyini.
That can be a challenge.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
In this case, as well.	Mu mbeera eno, nga bwe kiri.
He was really a great teacher.	Ddala yali musomesa nnyo.
He knows his stuff.	Amanyi ebintu bye.
But that, of course, is not the case.	Naye ekyo, ddala, si bwe kiri.
You can go home now.	Osobola okudda eka kati.
I feel that this is a dangerous place for you	Mpulira nti kino kifo kya bulabe gy’oli
I want to see everything with him	Njagala okulaba buli kimu naye
He tries to speak.	Agezaako okwogera.
I definitely knew that wasn’t for me	Namanya ddala nti ekyo si kyange
I was thinking about.	Nali ndowooza ku.
I work tomorrow morning.	Nkola enkya ku makya.
I was feeling good about it.	Nnali mpulira bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
I need to get away from everything	Nze nneetaaga okuva mu buli kimu
I couldn’t wait to be alone.	Nnali siyinza kulinda kubeera nzekka.
Now he knew.	Kati yali amanyi.
There is no space and no time.	Tewali kifo era tewali budde.
I think maybe it was me	Ndowooza osanga nnali nze
I thought, this is mine	Nalowooza nti, kino kyange
I thought of something	Nalowooza ku kintu
Whether you like it or not.	Oba oyagala oba toyagala.
I don’t want to come here at all	Saagala kujja wano n’akatono
I thought that was what he wanted.	Nalowooza nti ekyo kye yali ayagala.
He thought that was what he needed.	Yalowooza nti ekyo kye yali yeetaaga.
I guess he was thinking	Ntebereza nti yali alowooza
I couldn’t believe it was you	Nali sisobola kukkiriza nti ggwe
Why are you so beautiful.	Lwaki oli mulungi nnyo.
My job is the job.	Omulimu gwange gwe mulimu.
I didn’t think you wanted that.	Ekyo nali sirowooza nti oyagala.
Certainly, it is not.	Mazima ddala, si bwe kiri.
It was very intimate.	Kyali kya mukwano nnyo.
You are nothing.	Ggwe toli kintu kyonna.
I can’t go to school	Sisobola kugenda ku ssomero
We all have it.	Ffenna tulina.
But he knew that would never happen.	Naye yali akimanyi nti ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
I needed to get out of there	Nnali nneetaaga okuva awo
You know you’re going down.	Omanyi nti ogenda wansi.
He has.	Alina.
I didn’t know your plan	Nnali simanyi nteekateeka yo
I love this product!.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino!.
I needed to step back.	Nnali nneetaaga okudda emabega.
I wasn’t sure that.	Nali sikakasa nti.
But that may just be me.	Naye ekyo kiyinza okuba nga nze nzekka.
I've been thinking.	Mbadde ndowooza.
I don't know.	Simanyi.
A week here and there	Wiiki emu wano ne wali
It’s not a place, or a thing.	Si kifo, oba ekintu.
But other than that, not much.	Naye okuggyako ekyo, si bingi.
That’s what I want.	Ekyo njagala.
He formed this opinion.	Yakola endowooza eno.
I am a good father.	Ndi taata mulungi.
We can do it too.	Naffe tusobola okukikola.
Anything will work.	Ekintu kyonna kijja kukola.
You will, you will do it.	Ojja, ojja kukikola.
I knew it would be close	Nali mmanyi nti kijja kuba kumpi
And he is very powerful.	Era wa maanyi nnyo.
I think he knows that too	Ndowooza ekyo naye akimanyi
But no one knows it.	Naye tewali akimanyi.
But it had to work.	Naye kyalina okukola.
It was exactly that.	Ddala bwe kyali.
Or maybe not.	Oba mpozzi nedda.
This would be difficult to do.	Kino kyandibadde kizibu okukola.
You’re not alone.	Si ggwe wekka.
It’s not for everyone.	Si kya buli muntu.
I wanted to talk to you about this situation	Nnali njagala okwogera naawe ku mbeera eno
It’s a lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi nnyo.
I love being with you	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe
Who is with me?.	Ani ali nange?.
I know that's the issue now	Nkimanyi nti eyo y'ensonga kati
There are so many reasons.	Ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
He couldn't do that right now.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukikola mu kiseera kino.
I didn’t even know, as it happened.	Nze nali simanyi wadde, nga bwe kyali.
He is really very happy.	Ddala musanyufu nnyo.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Kya lwatu nti kino si bwe kiri.
I have to know everything	Nnina okumanya buli kimu
I can’t live without you	Siyinza kubeera nga tolina ggwe
It is in the works.	Kiri mu kukola.
It won’t be fast.	Tekijja kuba kya mangu.
It seems to be the right one for me.	Kirabika nga kye kituufu gyendi.
I was so ready to go home	Nali mwetegefu nnyo okudda eka
I had no plans for tonight	Ekiro kino nnali sirina nteekateeka yonna
I feel the same way you do	Nze mpulira nga naawe mpulira
This is actually pretty easy to do.	Kino mu butuufu kyangu nnyo okukola.
In a short time.	Mu bbanga ttono.
But something .	Naye ekintu .
I thought, no.	Nalowooza nti, nedda.
She is a beautiful, beautiful woman.	Ye mukyala mulungi, mulungi.
He also has a brother	Alina ne muganda we
There is no one like me.	Tewali muntu yenna nga nze.
But for how long?.	Naye okumala bbanga ki?.
I really didn't care about her	Mazima ddala nnali sifaayo ku nsonga ze
Where would he really be.	Wa yandibadde ddala.
I couldn’t do something like that	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu ng’ekyo
I live there now.	Nze mbeera eyo kati.
I can't 'believe it.	Siyinza 'kukkiriza.
I can’t say exactly what it is.	Siyinza kwogera bulungi kye kiri.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
Too many hours.	Ssaawa nnyingi nnyo.
I couldn’t tell where who	Nnali sisobola kumanya wa ani
You have three.	Olina ssatu.
He knew this.	Kino yali akimanyi.
I think that's very important.	Ndowooza ekyo 'kikulu nnyo.
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
Everything he needed.	Byonna bye yali yeetaaga.
I wanted to talk to you about something	Nnali njagala okwogera naawe ku kintu
I love being with him	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye
He appears, but we cannot see.	Alabika, naye tetusobola kulaba.
And in a way, of course, it is.	Era mu ngeri emu, kya lwatu, bwe kiri.
That’s what my father did.	Ekyo taata kye yakola.
You are a beautiful child.	Oli mwana mulungi.
I was a very good teacher	Nnali musomesa mulungi nnyo
I’m just a guy who wants money.	Nze ndi ggaayi yekka ayagala ssente.
He's a nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi.
But not right now.	Naye si mu kiseera kino.
A very short time.	Akaseera katono nnyo.
I may very well do that.	Ekyo nnyinza bulungi nnyo okukikola.
Maybe he did come into his own.	Mpozzi ddala yajja mu mbeera ze.
It wasn’t what he expected.	Si kye yali asuubira.
I thought it was you	Nalowooza nti ye ggwe
Obviously, that was the point.	Kya lwatu nti eyo ye yali ensonga.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
It’s really simple and powerful.	Ddala kyangu era kya maanyi.
I want to know what he was like	Njagala okumanya bwe yali
Happy to be with you as well.	Musanyufu okubeera naawe naawe.
And it was true.	Era kyali kituufu.
I don’t have any problems.	Sirina buzibu bwonna.
I didn’t even know what day of the week it was	Nnali simanyi na lunaku lwa wiiki
Exactly what we are.	Ddala kye tuli.
It could be him.	Kiyinza okuba nga ye.
I will not stay in this house	Sijja kusigala mu nnyumba eno
He said that.	Yayogera bw’atyo.
Of course that is not always the case.	Mazima ddala ekyo si bwe kiri bulijjo.
And you really need to get out of this place.	Era ddala olina okuva mu kifo kino.
Not what he expected at all.	Si kye yali asuubira n’akatono.
I couldn’t believe my luck	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza mukisa gwange
You may have it on your system.	Oyinza okuba nga olina ku nkola yo.
You’re in something.	Oli mu kintu.
I couldn’t tell before	Nnali sisobola kumanya emabegako
But he couldn't speak.	Naye yali tasobola kwogera.
You will go to the office.	Ojja kugenda mu ofiisi.
I should have thought about what he would like	Nnali nsaanidde okulowooza ku kye yandiyagadde
He had no time for any of that.	Yali talina budde ku kintu kyonna ku ebyo.
I want it all the time	Njagala buli kiseera
I can't eat.	Sisobola kulya.
We were in the same class at school.	Twali mu kibiina kye kimu ku ssomero.
I’m not sure why exactly.	Sikakasa lwaki ddala.
I am an opinionated person	Ndi muntu wa ndowooza
I didn’t know it could happen	Nnali simanyi nti kiyinza okubaawo
He told me he wanted to talk to me.	Yang’amba nti ayagala kwogera nange.
I wanted to.	Nnali njagala.
I was to preach there	Nnali wa kubuulira eyo
I don’t want to talk to him about this	Kino saagala kwogera naye
What a wonderful and thoughtful man he was.	Nga yali musajja mulungi nnyo era alowooza ennyo.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera.
But, but.	Naye, naye.
He could see why.	Yali asobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
This was going on.	Kino kyali kigenda mu maaso.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
But it’s really, really nice to be here.	Naye ddala, ddala kirungi okubeera wano.
I just need to talk to him.	Nze nneetaaga kwogera naye kyokka.
Perhaps he could.	Oboolyawo yali asobola.
One who.	Omu nga...
It’s not entirely your business.	Si nsonga yo yonna.
I need time to think.	Nneetaaga obudde okulowooza.
I can’t let anyone do that	Ekyo siyinza kukkiriza muntu yenna kukikola
He was my friend.	Yali mukwano gwange.
This is simply true.	Kino kituufu kyokka.
I thought.	Nalowooza.
That's just me though.	Oyo nze nzekka wadde.
It was a difficult time for both of them.	Kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo gye bali bombi.
And there is no father.	Era tewali taata.
I still can’t believe how good it looks	N’okutuusa kati siyinza kukkiriza ngeri gye kirabika nga kirungi
He could hardly speak	Yali tasobola bulungi kwogera
But that wasn’t the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kyali.
I don’t know anything about you	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ggwe
I know nothing about him.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
Anyone who wants to speak can speak.	Buli ayagala okwogera asobola okwogera.
This to me, is not work.	Kino gyendi, si mulimu.
I guess this is a form of that.	Ntebereza nti eno ngeri ya ekyo.
And it was difficult.	Era kyali kizibu.
I am a doctor.	Nze ndi musawo.
I thought he would come back	Nalowooza nti ajja kudda
But that wasn’t what he wanted now.	Naye ekyo si kye yali ayagala kati.
I was hoping he wouldn’t come home tonight	Nali nsuubira nti ekiro kino tajja kudda waka
It’s easy to see why.	Kyangu okulaba lwaki.
But he isn’t like that.	Naye ye si bw’atyo.
I should have just stayed home	Nnali nsaanidde kumala kusigala waka
I was thinking about my job	Nnali ndowooza ku mulimu gwange
That’s pretty much the same thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo ekintu kye kimu.
I don't know how to do this.	Kino simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukikola.
Where the problem lies.	Ekizibu we kiri.
I need to tell someone that	Ekyo nneetaaga okubuulira omuntu
I knew it was true	Namanya nti ddala
One thing was true.	Ekintu kimu kyali kituufu.
It is what it is.	Kye kiri bwe kiri.
I couldn’t say anything	Nnali sisobola kwogera kintu kyonna
It’s time to go home.	Kye kiseera okudda eka.
But that's not why you can't come with me.	Naye eyo si y'ensonga lwaki tosobola kujja nange.
But he was, too.	Naye yali, naye.
I wasn’t sure of anything	Nnali sikakasa kintu kyonna
I want to go home.	Njagala kudda waka.
You don’t have to come every day.	Tolina kujja buli lunaku.
There is a reason though.	Waliwo ensonga wadde.
Now we can, obviously.	Kati tusobola, kya lwatu.
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo
I couldn’t let that happen	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukkiriza kubaawo
I want to be there to help	Njagala kubeerawo okuyamba
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
I really wanted to do that	Ekyo nnali njagala nnyo okukikola
I do the calling myself	Nze kennyini nkola okukuba essimu
That wasn’t the problem.	Ekyo si kye kyali ekizibu.
He was still perfectly fine.	Yali akyali bulungi ddala.
I’m sure it’s him	Nkakasa nti ye ye
I can’t and neither can you	Sisobola era naawe tosobola
I have something to say.	Nnina kye nnina okwogera.
And anything can happen.	Era ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo.
He is my son.	Ye mwana wange.
I was fine alone	Nali bulungi nzekka
Which is what we should be doing.	Kye tusaanidde okukola.
I'm not sure what's going on here.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso wano.
Like right now.	Nga kati kati.
Here, however, the point soon became clear.	Kyokka wano, mu bbanga ttono ensonga yalabika bulungi.
This is my problem.	Kino kye kizibu kyange.
At the time it was easy.	Mu kiseera ekyo kyali kyangu.
I can't wait.	Siyinza kulinda.
He didn’t need to do that.	Yali teyeetaaga kukola ekyo.
That’s what I loved about him	Ekyo kye nnali njagala nnyo ku ye
I couldn’t do that at home	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola waka
But he is he is.	Naye ye ye.
It’s much more complicated than that.	Kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I'll just see.	Nja kumala kulaba.
Or so he thought.	Oba bw’atyo bwe yalowooza.
As I wish.	Nga bwe njagala.
From now on.	Okuva kati.
But no one did it.	Naye tewali yakikola.
That is one of the dangers.	Ekyo kye kimu ku bulabe.
I already knew this was going to happen	Kino nnali nkimanyi dda nti kigenda kubaawo
I think he would actually be pretty close.	Ndowooza mu butuufu yandibadde kumpi nnyo.
No one is in sight.	Tewali muntu yenna alabika.
I knew it was a good idea	Namanya nti kyali kirowoozo kirungi
He's doing really well.	Akola bulungi ddala.
And now it just isn’t.	Era kati si bwe kiri kyokka.
That’s what I do.	Kye nkola.
I have nothing to do with it either	Nange sirina kye nkola mu nsonga eyo
But, whether he is or not doesn’t really matter.	Naye, oba ali oba nedda si kikulu nnyo.
I can’t believe my luck	Siyinza kukkiriza mukisa gwange
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
But he was afraid.	Naye yali atya.
not much.	si bingi.
I thought it was a great thing to do.	Nalowooza nti kyali kirungi nnyo okukola.
I can’t do without you	Sisobola kukola nga tolina ggwe
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
I couldn’t quite see what it was.	Nnali sisobola kulaba bulungi kiki kye kyali.
You can certainly do these things.	Mazima ddala oyinza okukola ebintu bino.
I’ll do whatever you want.	Nja kukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
I knew that was what he wanted	Namanya nti ekyo kye yali ayagala
I want to be happy for a while.	Njagala kubeera musanyufu okumala akaseera.
I love everyone, and I hope you will too	Njagala nnyo buli omu, era nsuubira nti naawe ojja kukikola
I hope they are okay	Nsuubira nti bali bulungi
I now know it.	Nze kati nkimanyi.
Right now, probably.	Mu kiseera kino, oboolyawo.
I don’t have time to redo that	Ekyo sirina budde kuddamu kukikola
And he knew it.	Era yali akimanyi.
However, it is in theory.	Kyokka, kiri mu ndowooza.
He looks very happy.	Alabika nga musanyufu nnyo.
I have nothing to do with him	Sirina kye nkola ku ye
But there’s something about the guy.	Naye waliwo ekintu ku ggaayi oyo.
I guess it’s important to me	Ntebereza nti kikulu gyendi
He had to be here.	Yalina okubeera wano.
I didn’t know he was in this town	Nali simanyi nti ali mu kibuga kino
I'm fine, really.	Ndi bulungi, ddala.
But he just seemed like a guy.	Naye yali alabika nga ggaayi yekka.
For many situations, this is not a problem.	Ku mbeera nnyingi, kino si kizibu.
I can do this myself	Kino nsobola okukikola nze kennyini
I can’t believe my luck.	Siyinza kukkiriza mukisa gwange.
However, I can’t do what	Kyokka sisobola kukola ki
In a sense.	Mu ngeri emu.
And there’s plenty of time.	Era waliwo obudde bungi.
I knew it had to be something like that	Namanya nti kyalina okuba ekintu ng’ekyo
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
I think he might be my dad.	Ndowooza ayinza okuba nga ye taata wange.
But you are real.	Naye ggwe oli wa ddala.
I need to go now.	Nze nneetaaga okugenda kati.
I knew why.	Nnali mmanyi lwaki.
I need to do that with you	Ekyo nneetaaga okukikola naawe
I don't think though.	Sirowooza wadde.
And that’s what’s important to me.	Era ekyo kye kikulu gyendi.
I didn’t know he was sick	Nnali simanyi nti mulwadde
I was happy to see that	Ekyo nnali musanyufu okulaba
I thought that was it	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kye kyali
I’m sure I’ll do it for you	Nkakasa nti nja kukikola gy’oli
And in us.	Era mu ffe.
He would love it.	Yandiyagadde nnyo.
I want to know who he was	Njagala kumanya ani gwe yali
As my brother said, not so here.	Nga muganda wange bwe yagamba, wano si bwe kiri.
There was nothing wrong I could do.	Tewali kibi kye nnali nsobola kukola.
I thought it was going somewhere	Nalowooza nti waliwo we kigenda
He looked very happy.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo.
That looked great.	Ekyo kyali kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He is with us tonight.	Ali naffe ekiro kino.
Probably for the better.	Oboolyawo kya bulungi.
I really don’t know anything about anything.	Mazima ddala sirina kye mmanyi ku kintu kyonna.
What he looked happy about.	Kye yali alabika nga musanyufu.
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kirungi.
He is the one and only.	Ye omu era yekka.
It would be very difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
He needs to go to the hospital.	Yeetaaga okugenda mu ddwaaliro.
I think it will be alright	Ndowooza kijja kuba bulungi
That was normal.	Ekyo kyali kya bulijjo.
I think this will work.	Ndowooza kino kijja kukola.
Or no one is in it.	Oba tewali ali mu.
I thought he would be here now	Nalowooza nti kati yandibadde wano
I will never come here again	Sijja kuddamu kujja wano
You have to go.	Olina okugenda.
He will do it today.	Ajja kukikola leero.
I knew it would work	Nali nkimanyi nti kijja kukola
It’s easier for everyone that way.	Kyangu eri buli muntu mu ngeri eyo.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
If only we could all.	Singa ffenna tusobola.
It’s time to talk.	Kiseera kya kwogera.
I needed to know she was okay	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya nti yali bulungi
Everyone has an opinion.	Buli muntu alina endowooza.
It’s not even an issue.	Si wadde ensonga.
I just wanted to see what he did	Nnali njagala kulaba kye yakola kyokka
And there it is.	Era awo we wali.
They are in trouble.	Bali mu buzibu.
This seems to be true.	Kino kirabika nga kituufu.
And probably soon, we will.	Era oboolyawo mu bbanga ttono, tujja kukikola.
I could only imagine what he was thinking	Nnali nsobola okulowooza ku ekyo kye yali alowooza
How long is this going to last? 	Kino kigenda kumala bbanga ki?
Everything is in the air.	Buli kimu kiri mu bbanga.
I couldn’t say anything.	Nnali sisobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
You are a beautiful child.	Oli mwana mulungi.
Maybe that's the point.	Mpozzi eyo y'ensonga.
I couldn’t talk to him	Nnali sisobola kwogera naye
I know that will never happen.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
I’m not one of them.	Nze siri omu.
I knew he wouldn’t be able to afford one.	Namanya nti tajja kusobola kugula emu.
I thought you said it was human	Nalowooza nti wagamba nti muntu
And not just now.	Era si kati kyokka.
He needed to work and he did.	Yali yeetaaga okukola era bw’atyo bwe yakola.
I had no time for parties	Nnali sirina budde bwa mbaga
I plan on doing it here from now on	Nteekateeka okukikola wano okuva kati
He is better now.	Asinga kati.
I was there that night	Nnali awo ekiro ekyo
And that’s the point.	Era eyo y’ensonga.
I love everyone in this movie, everyone	Njagala nnyo buli muntu mu firimu eno, buli muntu
He will speak.	Ajja kwogera.
He didn’t know how much.	Yali tamanyi ssente mmeka.
No one here needs to know.	Tewali muntu yenna wano yeetaaga kumanya.
But he couldn’t believe it.	Naye yali tasobola kukkiriza.
He's a guy.	Ye ggaayi.
I was a child at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali mwana muto
It's not wa ye.	Si wa ye.
You have to imagine it was you.	Olina okulowooza nti gwe wali ggwe.
Perhaps he wanted to, too.	Oboolyawo naye yali ayagala.
I might have thought.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnalowooza.
I wasn’t going to be okay	Nze nali sigenda kuba bulungi
There are many reasons.	Waliwo ensonga nnyingi.
But it will be easier.	Naye kijja kuba kyangu.
I thought that was all	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyokka
I do things, you do things	Nze nkola ebintu, ggwe okola ebintu
No one really knows.	Tewali amanyi ddala.
And this is very important.	Era kino kikulu nnyo.
I will do this again.	Kino nja kuddamu okukola.
He needed to see.	Yali yeetaaga okulaba.
Not this movie.	Si firimu eno.
I'll do it in here	Nja kukikola mu wano
Now we will move on.	Kati tujja kugenda mu maaso.
I’m the only one in the place.	Nze nzekka ali mu kifo.
He was willing.	Yali ayagala.
He is talking to me.	Ayogera nange.
I just wanted to be home	Nnali njagala kubeera waka kyokka
I couldn’t see anything	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna
My father was	Taata yali .
I’m glad you’re interested.	Ndi musanyufu nti oyagala.
I hope this is okay with you.	Nsuubira nti kino kiri bulungi gyoli.
To see my father.	Okulaba taata wange.
You are not real.	Ggwe toli wa ddala.
I don’t want a relationship.	Nze saagala mukwano.
I really wanted someone to address the problem immediately.	Nnali njagala nnyo omuntu okukola ku kizibu ekyo mu bwangu.
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
It was his room but not his room.	Kyali kisenge kye naye si kisenge kye.
I need to know they are okay	Nnina okumanya nti bali bulungi
Is that just me?.	Oyo nze nzekka?.
Nothing was good.	Tewali kyali kirungi.
That’s not too bad.	Ekyo si kibi nnyo.
I'm going to work.	Ngenda ku mulimu.
You have no problem with that.	Ekyo tolina buzibu bwonna.
I don't know exactly.	Nze simanyi bulungi.
I really wanted someone	Nali njagala nnyo omuntu
You love to be.	Oyagala nnyo okubeera.
I have been doing my job too	Nze nange mbadde nkola omulimu gwange
I love everything about him	Njagala nnyo buli kimu kye
Almost that quickly.	Kumpi ekyo mu bwangu.
I thought she looked great	Nalowooza nti alabika bulungi nnyo
We are here for a reason.	Tuli wano lwa nsonga.
I didn’t really want to	Mu butuufu nnali saagala
No answer there, either.	Tewali kuddamu awo, era.
No, it’s fine.	Nedda, kirungi.
But he will do it.	Naye ajja kukikola.
Certainly not.	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
That's his whole point.	Eyo y'ensonga ye yonna.
I want a car.	Njagala mmotoka.
He's fine.	Ali bulungi.
It's always what you want.	Bulijjo kye kyoyagala.
I think there is no such thing	Ndowooza tewali kintu ng’ekyo
This is what he said.	Kino bwe yagambye.
I feel like everything is mine	Mpulira nga buli kimu kyange
He can’t, of course.	Tasobola, ddala.
I have to go.	Nnina okugenda.
I can help with that	Nsobola okuyamba ku ekyo
I think he’s fine right now	Ndowooza nti ali bulungi mu kiseera kino
This is just really complicated.	Kino kizibu ddala kyokka.
You know what that was like.	Omanyi ekyo bwe kyali.
But you don’t have to do without it.	Naye tolina kukola nga tolina.
I won’t get in trouble	Sijja kufuna buzibu
I don’t know what to do.	Simanyi kya kukola.
I will work from now on.	Nja kukola okuva kati.
You have that issue.	Olina ensonga eyo.
I can do things.	Nsobola okukola ebintu.
I doubt you have to do anything.	Nbuusabuusa nti olina okukola ekintu kyonna.
He wanted what he had.	Yali ayagala kye yalina.
I really need help.	Njagala nnyo obuyambi.
I won’t be home today	Sijja kudda waka leero
He had to be at work in an hour.	Yalina okubeera ku mulimu mu ssaawa emu.
That was great to see.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo okulaba.
This may be entirely true.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kituufu ddala.
But he couldn’t.	Naye yali tasobola.
That is a serious problem.	Ekyo kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I should have known, he thought	Nnali nsaanidde okumanya, bwe yalowooza
This was a good thing for me.	Kino kyali kintu kirungi gyendi.
Here he has help.	Wano alina obuyambi.
No, they are not.	Nedda, si bwe bali.
It was important to do so.	Kyali kikulu okukikola.
I love it though.	Njagala nnyo wadde.
I can’t go to the police	Sisobola kugenda ku poliisi
I knew that was it for me	Namanya nti ekyo kye kyali gyendi
I couldn’t go on alone	Nnali sisobola kugenda mu maaso nzekka
That could easily have happened.	Ekyo kyali kyangu okubaawo.
He knew he would.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
I’m not going to.	Nze sigenda.
But you are one too.	Naye naawe oli omu.
Making a phone call.	Okukuba essimu.
And I wondered that at the same time	Era ekyo ne nneebuuza mu kiseera kye kimu
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okukikola.
But it was good for me.	Naye kyali kirungi gyendi.
Of course, he could not do that	Kya lwatu nti ekyo yali tasobola kukikola
I feel so much better	Mpulira bulungi nnyo
Not everyone knew it.	Si buli muntu nti yali akimanyi.
He knew everybody.	Yali amanyi buli muntu.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
I will be at work tomorrow.	Nja kuba ku mulimu enkya.
I have to go immediately	Nnina okugenda amangu ddala
You won’t even know it’s there.	Tojja na kumanya nti kiri awo.
He knew he would be there.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kubeerawo.
I can do that myself	Ekyo nze kennyini nsobola okukikola
And that’s what’s happening.	Era ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso.
He’s a really good player.	Ddala muzannyi mulungi.
Not a very good situation.	Si mbeera nnungi nnyo.
It’s mine now.	Kye kyange kati.
I think that’s true	Ndowooza ekyo kituufu
I didn’t really know what he was talking about.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kye yali ayogera.
He may have found a friend.	Ayinza okuba nga yafuna mukwano gwe.
I want this.	Kino njagala.
It’s time to move on.	Kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
I knew nothing about it.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
No one needs to know.	Tewali muntu yenna yeetaaga kumanya.
It’s not even about money.	Si wadde ku ssente.
Here again he did not know what was going on.	Wano era yali tamanyi kyali kigenda mu maaso.
I was thinking about watching a movie	Nali ndowooza ku kulaba firimu
I do the same in the lower	Nze nkola kye kimu ne mu kya wansi
It was as simple as that.	Kyali kyangu nga ekyo.
I didn’t know much more than that	Nnali simanyi bingi okusinga ekyo
I don’t know what to say or do.	Simanyi kya kwogera oba kya kukola.
And that was a bad thing.	Era ekyo kyali kibi.
He would do anything.	Yandikoze ekintu kyonna.
I can’t eat anything	Sisobola kulya kintu kyonna
I am so beautiful.	Nze ndi mulungi nnyo.
He worked hard.	Yakola nnyo.
Of course he would.	Kya lwatu yandibadde.
It might not work though.	Kiyinza obutakola wadde.
That’s really no problem.	Ekyo ddala tewali buzibu.
He knew it well enough.	Yali akimanyi bulungi.
This isn’t a bad thing.	Kino si kibi.
I won’t answer.	Sijja kuddamu.
I knew it would be bad	Namanya nti kijja kuba kibi
He doesn't know why.	Tamanyi lwaki.
He was what he was.	Yali ky’ali.
I am ready.	Ndi mwetegefu.
I just hope it works out	Nsuubira kyokka nti kigenda bulungi
I didn’t know this would happen	Nnali simanyi nti kino kijja kubaawo
What is that.	Kiki ekyo.
He always said that about her.	Bulijjo bwe yali ayogera ku ye.
Food had to be there.	Emmere yalina okubaawo.
You go to work every day.	Ogenda ku mulimu buli lunaku.
Really my father.	Ddala taata wange.
But, who knows.	Naye, ani amanyi.
I will.	Nja.
You are in serious trouble.	Oli mu buzibu bwa maanyi.
And then now this.	Era awo kati kino.
Unusual.	Si kya bulijjo.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
I wanted to come back here.	Nnali njagala kudda wano.
I have a job to do	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola
And about how happy he was to be here.	Era ku ngeri gye yali musanyufu okubeera wano.
And that’s pretty cool.	Era ekyo kirungi nnyo.
But no one asked.	Naye tewali yasaba.
It was just normal.	Kyali kya bulijjo kyokka.
I didn’t want money.	Nnali saagala ssente.
I will stay with you.	Nja kusigala naawe.
Maybe you won’t.	Mpozzi tojja kukikola.
I need to work here.	Nze nneetaaga okukola wano.
I guess that’s very important	Ntebereza nti ekyo kikulu nnyo
That's me.	Oyo ye nze.
With his girlfriend.	Nga bali ne muganzi we.
He knows he needs to think.	Akimanyi nti yeetaaga okulowooza.
However, I know he needs to talk to you	Kyokka nkimanyi nti yeetaaga okwogera naawe
To me it is a good thing.	Eri nze kintu kirungi.
She loved dogs.	Yali ayagala nnyo embwa.
And why can’t he wait.	Era lwaki tasobola kulinda.
I couldn’t believe my luck.	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza mukisa gwange.
I really think we should talk	Nze ddala ndowooza nti tusaanidde okwogera
I still don't know what to do.	Nze n'okutuusa kati simanyi kya kukola.
I really need to get out of here soon	Mazima ddala nneetaaga okuva wano mu bbanga ttono
I know this.	Kino nkimanyi.
Today, there is a problem.	Leero, waliwo ekizibu.
I have been in here so long.	Mbadde mu wano ebbanga ddene nnyo.
It will continue.	Kijja kugenda mu maaso.
I have my phone on me	Nnina essimu yange ku nze
No, that’s not good.	Nedda, ekyo si kirungi.
I was just in his place	Nali mu kifo kye kyokka
I was so ready to move on.	Nnali mwetegefu nnyo okugenda mu maaso.
He agreed to what I wanted.	Yakkiriza kye nnali njagala.
Now I am in that situation	Kati ndi mu mbeera eyo
I thought we were safe	Nnalowooza nti tetulina bulabe
I think that’s not the case	Ndowooza ekyo si bwe kiri
That’s really a problem.	Ekyo ddala kizibu.
I think he knew that	Ndowooza ekyo yali akimanyi
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
He knew better.	Yali amanyi bulungi.
However, it is important to me.	Kyokka kikulu gyendi.
I think he was telling the truth	Ndowooza yali ayogera mazima
I was good at going	Nnali mulungi mu kugenda
I thought it was great	Nalowooza nti kyali kirungi nnyo
I can’t do this alone	Kino sisobola kukikola nzekka
He will have.	Ajja kuba ne.
I can’t believe we can get this far	Siyinza kukkiriza nti tusobola okutuuka wano
Or he could go see friends.	Oba yali asobola okugenda okulaba mikwano gye.
Everyone is a guy.	Buli muntu yenna.
I love time to myself	Njagala nnyo obudde eri nzekka
I am very happy to be here	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano
Of course, he did.	Kya lwatu nti yakikola.
He went right ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso ddala.
We have to talk again tomorrow.	Tulina okuddamu okwogera enkya.
I would love to do it for you	Njagala nnyo okukikola gy’oli
I knew what to expect	Nnali mmanyi kye nnali nsuubira
And that’s going on.	Era ekyo kigenda mu maaso.
You have to deliver by this time tomorrow.	Olina okutuusa mu kiseera kino enkya.
I cannot accept this fact.	Ensonga eno siyinza kukkiriza.
You can see why.	Osobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
I don’t know if you can do that.	Simanyi oba ekyo osobola okukikola.
He says he wants to talk to you.	Agamba nti ayagala kwogera naawe.
I knew he wasn’t very good for me	Nali nkimanyi nti si mulungi nnyo gyendi
He is really very good.	Ddala mulungi nnyo.
Doing this is easy.	Okukola kino kyangu.
I know I do.	Nkimanyi nti nkola.
He was such a strong player.	Yali muzannyi wa maanyi bw’atyo.
It was so close.	Yali kumpi nnyo.
Really you.	Ddala ggwe.
It’s not realistic.	Si kya ddala.
It is very difficult to read.	Kizibu nnyo okusoma.
Maybe this was the point.	Mpozzi eno ye yali ensonga.
I am very curious.	Njagala nnyo okumanya.
You probably won’t go at all.	Oboolyawo tojja kugenda n’akatono.
I don't know what's going on with this.	Simanyi kigenda mu maaso ku nsonga eno.
I thought about where I was going	Nalowooza ku wa gye nnali ngenda
No one in the prison speaks.	Tewali muntu yenna mu kkomera ayogera.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
But he is very good.	Naye mulungi nnyo.
I have no idea what it could be	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki kye kiyinza okuba
But he knew it was time.	Naye yali akimanyi nti kye kiseera.
I hope we will be friends	Nsuubira nti tujja kuba ba mukwano
Perhaps we should.	Oboolyawo tusaanidde.
I needed to find another like him	Nnali nneetaaga okufuna omulala nga ye
I couldn’t believe it either	Nange nnali sisobola kukkiriza
I will do that shortly.	Ekyo nja kukikola mu bbanga ttono.
I want to be like everyone else	Njagala kubeera nga buli muntu omulala
Like we all are.	Nga ffenna bwe tuli.
He came with her.	Yajja naye.
I may be asking too much	Nnyinza okuba nga nsaba bingi
I can’t do it alone.	Sisobola kukikola nzekka.
I wanted to see if you were doing well	Nnali njagala okulaba oba okola bulungi
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
. . . .	.
I didn’t know he was coming.	Nnali simanyi nti ajja.
I am not sure if this is true.	Sikakasa oba kino kituufu.
It can be difficult though.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu wadde.
I’ll know where you are	Nja kumanya gy’oli
He doesn’t know me.	Tamanyi nze.
He will have to work.	Ajja kuba alina okukola.
I knew something was going to happen	Nali mmanyi nti waliwo ekigenda okubaawo
He doesn't know what this would be.	Tamanyi kino kyandibadde ki.
No one can do that.	Ekyo tewali asobola kukikola.
I was just wondering if	Nali nneebuuza kyokka oba
I wanted to be with him	Nnali njagala kubeera wamu naye
The problem with so many cars.	Obuzibu bwa mmotoka nnyingi nnyo.
He thought it was unreal.	Yalowooza nti si kya ddala.
I always wanted to go	Bulijjo nnali njagala okugenda
It was sudden.	Kyali kya mangu.
I want to be a better person	Njagala okubeera omuntu omulungi
No one knows that better than you.	Ekyo tewali akimanyi okusinga ggwe.
I could definitely do this	Kino nnali nsobola okukikola ddala
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
He is very beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo.
He's on to something.	Ali ku kintu.
But he wasn’t.	Naye ye si bwe yali.
I thought maybe he was going to go to the police.	Nalowooza nti osanga yali agenda kugenda ku poliisi.
I certainly have.	Mazima ddala nnina.
And then we can move forward together.	Era awo tusobola okugenda mu maaso nga tuli wamu.
He just knew it.	Yali akimanyi kyokka.
But he couldn’t do it.	Naye yali tasobola kukikola.
That’s what he told me.	Ekyo kye yangamba.
I thought that was you here	Nalowooza nti oyo ggwe wano
That’s where he was.	Eyo gye yali.
I’m sure he’ll do well.	Nkakasa nti ajja kukola bulungi.
I was all those things	Nze ebintu ebyo byonna nali
He must act quickly.	Ateekwa okukola mu bwangu.
But that was not the case here.	Naye wano si bwe kyali.
But knowledge is one thing.	Naye okumanya kintu kimu.
He was in me now.	Yali mu nze kati.
Obviously, this is not true.	Kya lwatu nti kino si kituufu.
It’s really really great.	Ddala ddala kirungi nnyo.
I love it with him	Njagala nnyo naye
This will also help the police.	Kino kijja kuyamba ne poliisi.
I want to play with you	Njagala kuzannya naawe
But he couldn’t.	Naye yali tasobola.
I knew it wasn’t true	Namanya nti si kituufu
Not quite right though today.	Si kituufu nnyo naye leero.
I didn’t know he would do that though	Nnali simanyi nti ekyo ajja kukikola wadde
He is the only one.	Ye yekka.
If only he had one.	Singa yalina emu.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
I’m completely normal.	Nze ndi wa bulijjo ddala.
I still didn’t know if she was okay	N’okutuusa kati nnali simanyi oba yali bulungi
We have to do what we can to get to the point.	Tulina okukola kye tusobola okutuuka ku nsonga.
But that was beneath him	Naye ekyo kyali wansi we
That feels good to me.	Ekyo mpulira bulungi.
It doesn’t matter, we’re here.	Si kikulu, tuli wano.
Here we are making good progress.	Wano tugenda mu maaso bulungi.
He is really very good.	Ddala mulungi nnyo.
He didn’t want anything.	Yali talina ky’ayagala.
Far behind him.	Emabega we nnyo.
I guess that was the point	Ntebereza nti eyo ye yali ensonga
I knew it had to happen	Namanya nti kyalina okubaawo
I was like you at school, you know	Nze nali nga ggwe ku ssomero, omanyi
At the moment there is nothing.	Mu kiseera kino tewali kintu kyonna.
I just wanted a child	Nnali njagala mwana yekka
Maybe, maybe he knew anyway.	Mpozzi, mpozzi yali amanyi mu ngeri yonna.
I didn’t know what to do about that.	Ekyo nnali simanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo.
Everyone must have been at work.	Buli omu ateekwa okuba nga yali ku mulimu.
I didn’t know why that was so hard for me	Nnali simanyi lwaki ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo gyendi
But it’s difficult.	Naye kizibu.
I was sure it was real	Nali nkakasa nti kyali kya ddala
However, I have a phone	Kyokka nnina essimu
This was not the case.	Kino si bwe kyali.
I am well and happy.	Ndi bulungi era ndi musanyufu.
He has been very good at these.	Abadde mulungi nnyo mu bino.
I can't help whatever it is	Sisobola kuyamba ku kyonna kye kiri
He hoped it was true.	Yalina essuubi nti kituufu.
All of this.	Bino byonna.
This is just one thing.	Kino kimu kyokka.
To his office.	Eri ofiisi ye.
He hoped it looked good.	Yalina essuubi nti kirabika bulungi.
But that’s not to be.	Naye ekyo si kya kubeera.
Certainly not.	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
No, he couldn’t go back to that.	Nedda, yali tasobola kudda mu mbeera eyo.
You’re not alone.	Si ggwe wekka.
He'll come back, he thought.	Ajja kudda, bwe yalowooza.
I still don’t have an answer	N’okutuusa kati sirina kya kuddamu
This was not his town.	Kino si kye kyali kibuga kye.
I am happy to do so	Ndi musanyufu okukikola
And he did it well.	Era yakikola bulungi.
He was beneath her.	Yali wansi we.
You can do it.	Osobola okukikola.
I know him, him and his wife	Nkimanyi ye, ye ne mukyala we
I couldn’t find any work	Nnali sisobola kufuna mulimu yonna
It was probably pretty cool.	Oboolyawo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I really hoped it would happen	Nnali nsuubira nnyo nti kijja kubaawo
I was just wondering	Nze nnali nneebuuza kyokka
We’re going to do it this way.	Tugenda kukikola mu ngeri eno.
I wonder where they are	Nze nneebuuza gye bali
Maybe it’s this place.	Mpozzi nga kye kifo kino.
That’s not what it is.	Ekyo si kye kiri.
I wanted to be myself.	Nnali njagala kubeera nze kennyini.
He is beautiful in his own way.	Mulungi mu ngeri ye.
Not long now to go.	Si bbanga ddene kati okugenda.
We don’t have anything to eat.	Tetulina kya kulya.
Or to anyone else.	Oba eri omuntu yenna.
He knew what he was.	Yali amanyi kye yali.
You know this now.	Kino okimanyi kati.
I’m actually pretty good.	Mu butuufu ndi mulungi nnyo.
I had no choice	Nnali sirina kya kukola
There is a problem, of course.	Waliwo ekizibu, ddala.
I just want to be next to you	Njagala kubeera kumpi naawe kyokka
Nobody says anything.	Tewali ayogera kintu kyonna.
And here he was.	Era wano we yali.
I may have found it	Nnyinza okuba nga nfunye
Said.	Agamba.
And it’s so beautiful.	Era nga kirungi nnyo.
But how long, how long.	Naye bbanga ki, bbanga ki.
You can’t exist at all.	Tosobola kubeerawo n’akatono.
I can’t stay home today	Leero sisobola kusigala waka
I love how it looks!.	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kirabika!.
You can definitely do this.	Kino osobola ddala okukikola.
No one came here.	Tewali yajja wano.
Like, right now.	Nga, mu kiseera kino.
He wanted to go home.	Yali ayagala kudda waka.
I think you are like him	Ndowooza naawe oli nga ye
That’s just an idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kyokka.
He is very happy that he is here.	Musanyufu nnyo nti ali wano.
When he wasn’t with her.	Bwe yali tali naye.
It's the clock.	Ye ssaawa.
I don’t know for a long time.	Simanyi ku bbanga ddene.
I wish I could get home	Njagala nnyo okutuuka awaka
Whatever the police said about it.	Kyonna poliisi kye yayogera ku nsonga eyo.
He didn’t have much.	Yali talina bingi.
There, you may go now.	Eyo, oyinza okugenda kati.
He is there now.	Ali awo kati.
It was a place of everything and nothing.	Kyali kifo kya buli kimu era nga tewali kintu kyonna.
I knew he was happy	Namanya nti yali musanyufu
I couldn’t see very clearly	Nnali sisobola kulaba bulungi nnyo
Maybe he should go.	Mpozzi yandibadde agenda.
I can’t believe it or live with myself	Sisobola kukkiriza oba okubeera nange kennyini
I was so young, so scared	Nnali muto nnyo, nga ntya nnyo
However, it was true.	Kyokka, kyali kituufu.
You can come back here.	Oyinza okudda wano.
I can barely talk or eat.	Sisobola bulungi kwogera wadde okulya.
I need to do this myself	Kino nneetaaga okukikola nzekka
There.	Awo.
He doesn’t have to stay here.	Talina kusigala wano.
If only.	Singa kyokka.
I wanted to be alone	Nnali njagala kubeera nzekka
I feel what’s going to happen	Mpulira ekigenda okubaawo
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
He felt very, very sick.	Yawulira nga mulwadde nnyo nnyo.
You know why we’re here.	Omanyi lwaki tuli wano.
Not much.	Si bingi.
He is a good father.	Ye taata mulungi.
I love this dog.	Njagala nnyo embwa eno.
It can be difficult though.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu wadde.
You were just a kid.	Ggwe wali mwana muto yekka.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
I was the one who was me.	Nze nali nze.
I want almost	Njagala kumpi
And yet it continues.	Era naye kigenda mu maaso.
I was hoping you would be okay	Nali nsuubira nti ojja kubeera bulungi
You can’t work with the system.	Tosobola kukola na nkola.
I hope everything is okay	Nsuubira nti buli kimu kiri bulungi
That, of course, he was.	Ekyo, ddala, kye yali.
We have to get back to this.	Tulina okudda ku kino.
I need to do it	Nze nneetaaga okukikola
But you know it was .	Naye omanyi nti kyali .
You know how to do this.	Kino omanyi okukikola.
He knows it.	Akimanyi.
And maybe he couldn’t do it.	Era mpozzi nga tasobola kukikola.
Certainly there is.	Mazima ddala waliwo.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
I needed that.	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga.
You can do this!!.	Kino osobola okukikola!!.
I want to be alone, today	Njagala kubeera nzekka, leero
I wanted to go alone	Nnali njagala kugenda nzekka
I thought it was him.	Nnalowooza nti ye yali.
They are with us.	Bali naffe.
He wanted to help.	Yali ayagala kuyamba.
Either way, he should try.	Mu ngeri yonna, yandibadde agezaako.
I thought it was a good idea.	Nalowooza nti kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
Glad to see behind him.	Musanyufu okulaba emabega we.
I don’t have much time	Nze sirina budde bungi
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
And that he didn’t need to.	Era nti yali teyeetaaga.
I should definitely go home	Mazima ddala nsaanidde okudda eka
I know it very well.	Nkimanyi bulungi nnyo.
Here the picture is a bit complicated.	Wano ekifaananyi kizibu katono.
I hope you will be very comfortable there.	Nsuubira nti ojja kubeera bulungi nnyo eyo.
And that's all there is, you know.	Era ekyo kyokka kye kiri, omanyi.
This is very, very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo, kikulu nnyo.
That he was done with himself.	Nti yali amaze ku ye kennyini.
I thought a lot about myself	Nalowooza nnyo ku nze
You don’t have a house.	Tolina nnyumba.
But just a little bit.	Naye katono ddala.
But the problem is we.	Naye ekizibu tuli.
I just can’t do this	Kino sisobola kukikola kyokka
But, no, he won’t.	Naye, nedda, tajja kukikola.
But mostly him.	Naye okusinga ye.
That would be too easy for me.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo gyendi.
He thought he would be.	Yalowooza nti yandibadde.
You should, anyway.	Olina, mu ngeri yonna.
But it was good.	Naye kyali kirungi.
I’m absolutely fine.	Nze ndi bulungi ddala.
But, it doesn’t matter.	Naye, si nsonga.
Now he knew why.	Kati yali amanyi lwaki.
I couldn’t let that happen	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukkiriza kubaawo
It was that sort of thing.	Kyali kintu kya ngeri eyo.
I was there for the guy.	Nze nnali awo.
On, and on, and on.	Ku, ne ku, ne ku.
And so did my father.	Era ne taata bwe yakola.
It was just an idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kyokka.
Almost everyone.	Kumpi buli muntu yenna.
We have no idea.	Tetulina kirowoozo kyonna.
I can’t believe this is happening	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kino kigenda mu maaso
He was happy to be here.	Yali musanyufu okubeera wano.
I may have to do it anyway	Nnyinza okuba nga nnina okukikola mu ngeri yonna
I’m not sure how or why.	Sikakasa ngeri ki oba lwaki.
I know you know that.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo okimanyi.
This food was excellent.	Emmere eno yali nnungi nnyo.
That dinner with you.	Ekyeggulo ekyo naawe.
I’ll see what we can do.	Nja kulaba kye tusobola okukola.
It doesn’t matter to me.	Si kikulu gyendi.
Good job.	Omulimu mulungi.
I knew what was going to happen	Nnali mmanyi ekigenda okubaawo
However, it is not the case now.	Kyokka kati si bwe kiri.
He is in the works.	Ali mu mulimu.
What is going on? 	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso?
He was ready.	Yali mwetegefu.
He did so many things for it	Yakikola ebintu bingi nnyo
Of course, this could be any book.	Kya lwatu nti kino kiyinza okuba ekitabo kyonna.
I had no idea	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna
He has plenty as he told me so.	Alina bingi nga bwe yang’amba bw’atyo.
Now, we need to go.	Kati, twetaaga okugenda.
I have a lot of that	Ebyo nnina bingi
While in office.	Nga ali mu ofiisi.
I will have to do it.	Nja kuba nnina okukikola.
Everyone is doing the work.	Buli omu akola omulimu.
You are not a person.	Ggwe toli muntu.
Almost an hour.	Kumpi ssaawa emu.
And so much more!!.	Era bingi nnyo!!.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
This is a powerful process.	Eno nkola ya maanyi nnyo.
I know that about you too	Ekyo nange nkimanyi ku ggwe
But certainly not now.	Naye mazima ddala si kati.
I can’t say much much right now	Siyinza kwogera bingi bingi mu kiseera kino
I knew what he was thinking	Namanya kye yali alowooza
At this point, he wasn’t quite yet.	Mu kiseera kino, yali tannaba bulungi.
You're with me.	Oli nange.
And you can be!.	Era osobola okuba!.
He can do what he wants.	Asobola okukola ky’ayagala.
I'm not quite sure how to go about this.	Sikakasa nnyo ngeri ki gye nnyinza kugenda mu nsonga eno.
I just want to be here	Njagala kubeera wano kyokka
To be something.	Okubeera ekintu.
He certainly didn’t know.	Mazima ddala yali tamanyi.
And he would like to.	Era yandiyagadde.
For me it was practical.	Nze kyali kya nkola.
I know he does.	Nkimanyi nti akola bw’atyo.
I knew this was coming for a long time	Kino nnali nkimanyi nti kijja okumala ebbanga ddene
I know how busy you are.	Nze mmanyi engeri gy’oli bbize.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
I needed to be alone	Nnali nneetaaga kubeera nzekka
I wasn’t really sure	Nali sikakasa ddala
Someone can help.	Waliwo asobola okuyamba.
Maybe this will help someone else.	Mpozzi kino kijja kuyamba omuntu omulala.
I was here but my wife was	Nze nali wano naye mukyala wange yali
I could have been.	Nnali nsobola.
He didn't know what to do with her.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola ku ye.
He looked like me.	Yali alabika nga nze.
I know he was telling the truth	Nkimanyi nti yali ayogera mazima
Why in this place? 	Lwaki mu kifo kino?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I'm not sure what the problem is, here.	Sikakasa buzibu ki, wano.
You know why, of course.	Omanyi lwaki, ddala.
I thought it was a good idea	Nalowooza nti kyali kirowoozo kirungi
I have to act quickly	Nnina okukola amangu
I have to tell someone.	Nnina okubuulira omuntu.
I mostly think it is	Nze okusinga ndowooza nti bwe kiri
And why.	Era lwaki.
He agreed anyway.	Yakkiriza mu ngeri yonna.
He has always known.	Bulijjo abadde amanyi.
I think he could help	Ndowooza yali asobola okuyamba
I needed that book tomorrow	Ekitabo ekyo nnali nneetaaga enkya
I wish I had you as my friend.	Njagala nnyo okubeera nga ggwe mukwano gwange.
A friend of my father’s	Mukwano gwa taata wange
We’re going to be who we are.	Tugenda kubeera kye tuli.
You have to see this.	Kino olina okulaba.
I have no idea how much	Sirina kirowoozo ku ssente mmeka
a.	omu.
I couldn’t do anything	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
But he is a young child.	Naye ye mwana muto.
I guess we can talk to him about it	Ntebereza nti tusobola okwogera naye ku nsonga eyo
I want to know what’s going on	Njagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
I am definitely feeling better this morning.	Mazima ddala mpulira bulungi enkya ya leero.
I'm not quite sure why.	Sikakasa nnyo lwaki.
Certainly not.	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
I feel that was pretty cool.	Mpulira nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I can never do that to you	Ekyo siyinza n’akatono okukikola gy’oli
In the room.	Mu kisenge.
We have so much to do.	Tulina bingi nnyo bye tulina okukola.
I have been thinking about this.	Kino mbadde ndowooza ku nsonga eno.
But it can happen.	Naye kiyinza okubaawo.
We have nothing on him.	Tetulina kintu kyonna ku ye.
I had no idea what that was	Ekyo nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ki
He was a wonderful child.	Yali mwana mulungi nnyo.
I didn’t know what was going on	Nnali simanyi kigenda mu maaso
The person is still a man.	Omuntu akyali musajja.
And then, nothing.	Era awo, tewali kintu kyonna.
You know, he's a very strong guy.	Omanyi ggaayi wa maanyi nnyo.
But that’s what it is now.	Naye ekyo kye kiri kati.
There is a problem for me.	Waliwo ekizibu gyendi.
Of course, this is not entirely the case.	Kya lwatu nti kino si bwe kiri ddala.
It’s easy to see.	Kyangu okulaba.
I was definitely pretty good	Mazima ddala nnali mulungi nnyo
He would have been stronger than that.	Yandibadde asinga ekyo amaanyi.
He goes everywhere.	Agenda buli wamu.
I wonder if that’s what’s going on here	Nze nneebuuza oba ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso wano
Everyone knows what’s going on.	Buli omu amanyi ekigenda mu maaso.
I knew nothing of that	Ebyo nnali simanyi kintu kyonna
Not even a person.	Si wadde omuntu.
I was curious what he thought	Nnali njagala nnyo okumanya kye yali alowooza
I couldn’t even say anything	Nnali sisobola kwogera wadde ekintu kyonna
That was good for me.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
And the guy.	Era ggaayi.
I knew it would happen.	Nnali nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
I wonder if he even had an office	Nneebuuza oba yalina ne ofiisi
For a long time I did this.	Okumala ebbanga nga nkola kino.
But here is a problem.	Naye wano waliwo ekizibu.
Good, he was going down.	Kirungi, yali agenda wansi.
It really is a thing of beauty.	Ddala kintu kya bulungi.
We need three though.	Twetaaga ssatu wadde.
That’s a good thing.	Kirungi ekyo.
It just looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo kyokka.
What we have.	Kye tulina.
I don’t want anything	Sirina kye njagala
You can’t tell.	Tosobola kumanya.
I knew he had been doing very well	Namanya nti abadde akola bulungi nnyo
That can happen to anyone.	Ekyo kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna.
I couldn’t win.	Nnali sisobola kuwangula.
Not bad.	Si kibi.
I really hope that’s true	Nsuubira nnyo nti ekyo kituufu
He had always been like that.	Bulijjo yali abadde bw’atyo.
I want to be comfortable in that moment.	Njagala kubeera bulungi mu kiseera ekyo.
No one knows at this point.	Tewali amanyi mu kiseera kino.
Something is going on.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
That thing is just him.	Ekintu ekyo ye yekka.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
I need to talk to you.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe.
He wanted to talk to her.	Yali ayagala okwogera naye.
What do you think will happen?.	Olowooza kiki ekigenda okubaawo?.
It’s a serious issue for me.	Ensonga ya maanyi gyendi.
I knew it was him	Namanya nti ye ye
It is actually one and the same thing.	Mu butuufu kintu kimu era kye kimu.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
I know you have to go.	Nkimanyi nti olina okugenda.
I’ll be fine now.	Nja kuba bulungi kati.
What is going to happen?.	Kiki ekigenda okubaawo?.
I could have you now	Nnali nsobola okuba naawe kati
I can’t see who it is	Sisobola kulaba ani
In many cases.	Mu mbeera nnyingi.
I knew you’d be fine without me	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kuba bulungi nga si nze
I have to do it	Nnina okukikola
But he felt the same way.	Naye naye yawulira bw’atyo.
I know, anything	Nkimanyi, ekintu kyonna
I knew what he was thinking	Nnali mmanyi kye yali alowooza
I had no idea how to respond	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ngeri gye nnali nnyinza kuddamu
I love this product.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino.
Things like that.	Ebintu nga ebyo.
I have no idea what that is	Sirina kye mmanyi nti ekyo kye kiri
However, probably not.	Kyokka, oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
I thought you’d be ready soon	Nalowooza nti ojja kuba mwetegefu mangu
It was just a visual thing we could do.	Kyali kintu kya kulaba kye tusobola okukola kyokka.
It’s not a systematic approach.	Si nkola ya nkola.
And mostly for him, too.	Era okusinga ku ye, naye.
You can’t believe it.	Tosobola kukkiriza.
I’ll do it for you	Nja kukikola gy’oli
What is the problem with me? 	Kiki ekizibu gyendi?
Not because of this.	Si lwa kino.
I didn’t know it was going to be hard	Nnali simanyi nti kigenda kuba kizibu
I think that would be much easier	Ndowooza ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo
I don’t know why.	Simanyi lwaki.
I want to know where you were so far	Njagala kumanya gye wali okutuusa kati
We’ll do it ourselves.	Ffe tujja kukikola.
And he would be like that.	Era yandibadde bw’atyo.
I don’t want to go.	Saagala kugenda.
I really didn’t want to	Mazima ddala nnali saagala
I expected something like this.	Nnali nsuubira ekintu nga kino.
I should just go home.	Nsaanidde kumala kudda waka.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
I’m glad you’re here.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano.
Not there, either.	Si awo, era.
I said he shouldn’t go home	Nagamba nti talina kudda waka
I need help with that	Ekyo nneetaaga obuyambi
I am not home, this is not home.	Siri waka, eno si waka.
We can’t do without it.	Tetusobola kukola nga tetulina.
All these things.	Ebintu bino byonna.
I could see everything	Nnali nsobola okulaba buli kimu
This may be the case.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
I know what it is.	Nze mmanyi kye kiri.
For a long time, though, no one knew that.	Kyokka okumala ebbanga ddene, ekyo tewali yali akimanyi.
He was just a good kid.	Yali mwana mulungi yekka.
It is a very serious problem.	Kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I think he is the one.	Ndowooza ye ye.
I hope he is still safe	Nsuubira nti akyali mu mbeera nnungi
I don’t think that’s a good idea right now	Ndowooza ekyo si kirowoozo kirungi mu kiseera kino
I thought it would be nice	Nalowooza nti kyandibadde kirungi
That’s what he was afraid of.	Ekyo kye yali atya.
This house is mine.	Ennyumba eno nze.
I was so ready to do it	Nnali mwetegefu nnyo okukikola
I needed to see here there	Nnali nneetaaga okulaba wano awo
I knew you were there	Nali mmanyi nti oli awo
I actually loved it.	Mu butuufu nnali njagala nnyo.
I didn’t know why	Nnali simanyi nsonga lwaki
I really wanted to be around him	Ddala nnali njagala kubeera kumpi naye
We need to get help.	Tulina okufuna obuyambi.
I needed to have him there.	Nnali nneetaaga okubeera naye eyo.
I think this is not your case.	Ndowooza eno si nsonga yo.
I want to quit my job	Njagala okuva ku mulimu gwange
That was a common issue.	Eyo yali nsonga ya bulijjo.
Probably not until this afternoon.	Oboolyawo si okutuusa akawungeezi ka leero.
A little while ago.	Akaseera katono emabega.
Now I can’t do anything about it	Kati sisobola kukikola kintu kyonna
I just want to stay here a little longer	Njagala kumala kusigala wano akaseera katono
This is not quite true.	Kino si kituufu nnyo.
I'm glad you have	Ndi musanyufu nti olina
I won’t believe it, I won’t believe it	Sijja kukkiriza, sijja kukkiriza
And it’s not just that.	Era si ekyo kyokka.
I’m doing pretty well.	Nkola bulungi nnyo.
That wasn’t the case.	Ekyo si bwe kyali.
I could be indifferent too	Nange nsobola okuba nga sifaayo
He is much better now.	Asinga nnyo kati.
Really bad for the money.	Ddala kibi nnyo ku ssente.
He loved it here.	Yali ayagala nnyo wano.
They are just there.	Bali awo kyokka.
Now he couldn’t go.	Kati yali tasobola kugenda.
I and you are like you.	Nze naawe nga ggwe.
This is for my brother.	Kino kya muganda wange.
However, she was very handsome.	Kyokka, yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
He has to be there.	Alina okubaawo.
He did very well.	Yakola bulungi nnyo.
I couldn’t believe this was actually happening	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti ddala kino kyali kigenda mu maaso
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
Obviously I can’t be friends with him	Kya lwatu sisobola kuba mukwano naye
However, probably not.	Kyokka, oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
I really hope you can as well	Nsuubira ddala nti osobola nga bwe kiri
I don’t think he does.	Sirowooza nti akola bw’atyo.
I knew what he was thinking.	Nnali mmanyi kye yali alowooza.
I know it better now	Nze nkimanyi bulungi kati
He was very aware of that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi nnyo.
It was a wonderful time.	Kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
I didn’t really know where you were	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi gyoli
It will happen soon enough.	Kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono.
There is, of course.	Waliwo, ddala.
You were a child too.	Naawe wali mwana muto.
Or so he felt.	Oba bwe yawulira.
Pretty.	Mulungi.
Week after week.	Wiiki ku wiiki.
That’s not my point.	Eyo si nsonga yange.
I don’t want anyone to know	Saagala muntu yenna kumanya
If only he knew.	Singa yali amanyi.
I doubt that it is.	Nbuusabuusa nti bwe kiri.
He doesn’t know.	Tamanyi.
We’re going to do one.	Tugenda kukola kimu.
He had so much.	Yalina bingi nnyo.
I can’t wait, actually	Siyinza kulinda, mu butuufu
He had something he wanted.	Yali alina ky’ayagala.
That’s what any of us had.	Ekyo omuntu yenna ku ffe kye yalina.
This is not serious.	Kino si kya maanyi.
I wasn’t sure if he actually had one	Nali sikakasa oba ddala yalina emu
This is what we were.	Kino kye twali.
He went to school to study early.	Yagenda mu ssomero okusoma nga bukyali.
That's if he was home.	Ekyo singa yali waka.
I have always loved reading	Bulijjo njagala nnyo okusoma
And it may be true.	Era kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
I know it’s hard	Nkimanyi nti kizibu
I am not of that opinion	Nze siri wa ndowooza eyo
Certainly not why.	Mazima ddala si ekyo lwaki.
I didn’t know where I was going	Nnali simanyi wa gye nnali ngenda
And he was strong.	Era yali wa maanyi.
He has to get to the bottom of this.	Alina okutuuka wansi ku kino.
I have no idea who has me	Sirina kirowoozo ku ani alina nze
But that’s not really a problem.	Naye ekyo mu butuufu si kizibu.
I suppose we were lucky.	Nsuubira nti twali ba mukisa.
But you were real.	Naye wali wa ddala.
I know nothing about it	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo
Or maybe not.	Oba mpozzi nedda.
I feel afraid to go with him now	Mpulira nga ntya okugenda naye kati
In this office.	Mu ofiisi eno.
That he was fine.	Nti yali bulungi.
I know what they are.	Nze mmanyi kye bali.
That is true right now.	Ekyo kituufu mu kiseera kino.
It’s not just that.	Si ekyo kyokka.
And he knew it.	Era yali amanyi.
But he did as well as he could.	Naye yakola bulungi nga bwe yali asobola.
Perhaps he can.	Oboolyawo asobola.
It’s not mine.	Si kyange.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
I need to know where this is going	Nnina okumanya kino gye kigenda
I know somebody.	Nze waliwo gwe mmanyi.
I knew he would be fine	Namanya nti ajja kuba bulungi
No, it’s not a car.	Nedda, si mmotoka.
He can do what he wants with it.	Asobola okukikola ky’ayagala.
He would have to act quickly.	Yandibadde alina okukola amangu.
Here to help.	Wano okuyamba.
I want to get to the bottom of this	Njagala okutuuka wansi ku nsonga eno
He is the only man.	Ye musajja yekka.
He had been afraid to do it.	Yali abadde atya okukikola.
I don’t want to deal with this	Saagala kukola ku nsonga eno
I love my father very much	Njagala nnyo taata
I'll talk to him.	Nja kwogera naye.
That’s pretty easy.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo.
Really, we can go in my car.	Ddala, tusobola okugenda mu mmotoka yange.
But just a little bit.	Naye katono ddala.
I wasn’t sure it was it	Nnali sikakasa nti kye kyali
I want to go alone.	Njagala kugenda nzekka.
It was a real disaster	Kyali kizibu kya ddala
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
I wish every day was the same	Njagala nnyo buli lunaku okubeera kye kimu
We can buy things,.	Tusobola okugula ebintu,.
I wonder if he works hard	Nneebuuza oba akola nnyo
I thought that was good	Nnalowooza nti eyo yali nnungi
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
I wonder if he knew that	Nneebuuza oba ekyo yali akimanyi
That was one.	Eyo yali emu.
I didn’t know where you were	Nali simanyi gyoli
But you have to know.	Naye olina okumanya.
But that is my problem.	Naye ekyo kye kizibu kyange.
I was scared, you know.	Nali ntya, omanyi.
You would have gone without us.	Wandibadde ogenda nga tetulina.
And he has to work.	Era alina okukola.
There is nothing at all.	Tewali kintu na kimu.
But now you know it’s there, and everywhere.	Naye kati omanyi nti kiri awo, ne buli wamu.
And it was a good thing he did.	Era kyali kintu kirungi kye yakola.
Or maybe a lot.	Oba mpozzi bingi.
I can come back to one tomorrow	Nsobola okudda ku emu enkya
Don't go there.	Togenda eyo.
I'm glad he's coming with me	Ndi musanyufu nti ajja nange
I think more than anyone in the house.	Ndowooza okusinga omuntu yenna mu nnyumba.
We'll talk tomorrow.	Tujja kwogera enkya.
It was the whole organization.	Kyali kibiina kyonna.
That on his part.	Nti ku ludda lwe ye.
It will probably happen again next week.	Oboolyawo kijja kuddamu okubaawo wiiki ejja.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
This is true for any system.	Kino kituufu ku nkola yonna.
I was the only child	Nze nali mwana nzekka
I can’t do that to a guy	Ekyo sisobola kukikola ku ggaayi
I didn’t know what to believe	Nnali simanyi kya kukkiriza
It was him.	Yali ye.
Good job in saying that.	Omulimu mulungi mu kwogera ekyo.
I had nothing to say	Nnali sirina kye nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera
It’s hard to exist.	Kizibu okubaawo.
I could have gone.	Nnali nsobola okugenda.
He seemed normal.	Yalabika nga wa bulijjo.
I knew he would.	Nnali nkimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
But you will do just fine.	Naye ojja kukola bulungi nnyo.
It was his girlfriend’s idea at the time.	Yali ndowooza ya muganzi we mu kiseera ekyo.
I know how.	Nze mmanyi engeri.
It was something.	Yali kintu.
I knew where this was going	Kino nali mmanyi gye kigenda
I've had so much trouble.	Nze nfunye obuzibu bungi nnyo.
My home.	Awaka wange.
I know you can do the job	Nkimanyi nti osobola okukola omulimu
I am well enough now to resume my studies.	Ndi bulungi kati okuddamu okusoma.
I need some time to process this	Nze nneetaaga akaseera okukola ku nsonga eno
None too soon.	Tewali mangu nnyo.
But he wasn’t going to say that.	Naye yali tagenda kwogera bw’atyo.
But not everyone has it easy.	Naye si buli muntu nti alina kyangu.
It was a matter of when	Yali nsonga ya ddi
He wants to know it’s real.	Ayagala okumanya nti kya ddala.
He is still very good.	Akyali mulungi nnyo.
She was a really nice woman.	Yali mukyala mulungi ddala.
That was just a bit of luck.	Ekyo kyali kya mukisa katono ddala.
I am alone, but not alone	Nze ndi nzekka, naye si nzekka
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo .
My plan worked.	Enteekateeka yange yakola.
He did the job.	Yakola omulimu.
Whether you know it or not.	Oba okimanyi oba nedda.
I thought today was yesterday	Nalowooza nti leero lwa jjo
I can’t say exactly when.	Siyinza kwogera ddala ddi.
Of course, I can’t even do this well	Kya lwatu nti kino sisobola na kukikola bulungi
I think that’s a good thing	Ndowooza ekyo kintu kirungi
I was hoping you would	Nali nsuubira nti ojja kukikola
You can get a job too.	Naawe oyinza okufuna omulimu.
Something he couldn't do right now.	Ekintu kye yali tasobola kukola mu kiseera kino.
And it comes quickly.	Era kijja mangu.
Maybe this afternoon.	Mpozzi akawungeezi ka leero.
You can’t have too many.	Tosobola kuba na bingi nnyo.
He is the only one.	Ye yekka.
You make the point.	Ggwe okola ensonga.
Maybe it’s not.	Mpozzi si bwe kiri.
I know this	Kino nkimanyi
That was a terrible thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi nnyo.
I was nervous, but that was normal	Nnali ntya naye ekyo kyali kya bulijjo
Now we have to think about what that idea really was.	Kati tulina okulowooza ku ndowooza eyo kye yali ddala.
I couldn’t believe my luck	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza mukisa gwange
This is definitely not the case.	Mazima ddala kino si bwe kiri.
How beautiful of him.	Nga mulungi nnyo ku ye.
I will not be a curious person	Sijja kuba muntu ayagala kumanya
Indeed, he obviously can’t.	Mazima ddala, kirabika tasobola.
And it wasn’t.	Era si bwe yali.
I honestly couldn’t see what she looked like	Mu butuufu nnali sisobola kulaba ngeri gye yali alabika
You will see why.	Ojja kulaba lwaki.
I love working with him	Njagala nnyo okukola naye
Whatever that is.	Kyonna ekyo kye kiri.
I wasn’t sure myself at the time	Nze kennyini mu kiseera ekyo nnali sikakasa
I just knew it was him.	Nze nnali mmanyi nti ye yali.
I knew exactly what he was going to do	Nnali mmanyi bulungi kye yali agenda okukola
I deserve better	Nze nsaanidde okusinga
I don’t know what the situation is.	Simanyi mbeera ki.
Actually it is not .	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri .
We have a problem.	Tulina ekizibu.
Maybe he can’t, yet.	Mpozzi nga tasobola, n’okutuusa kati.
I think you should be here	Ndowooza olina okubeera wano
I am happy to be here.	Ndi musanyufu okubeera wano.
I wanted to know.	Nnali njagala okumanya.
I was everything I was	Nze buli kimu kye nnali
And in truth, he didn’t need one.	Era mu mazima, yali teyeetaaga emu.
That will do for now.	Ekyo kijja kukola kati.
What do you want from me?.	Oyagala ki gyendi?.
I need food right now	Nze nneetaaga emmere mu kiseera kino
I love reading a book	Njagala nnyo okusoma ekitabo
That won’t be easy.	Ekyo tekijja kuba kyangu.
He's not there.	Tali awo.
Of course, he did.	Kya lwatu nti yakikola.
This is certainly dangerous work.	Mazima ddala kino mulimu gwa bulabe.
I am suddenly very happy	Ndi musanyufu nnyo mu bwangu
There is nothing for you there.	Tewali kintu kyonna gy’oli eyo.
I wondered why he was here	Nneebuuza lwaki yali wano
It will be enough.	Kijja kumala.
I wonder what you were	Nneebuuza nti wali otya
It’s not exactly easy.	Si kyangu ddala.
What did he do.	Yakola kiki.
He lives at home.	Abeera waka.
I couldn’t see.	Nnali sisobola kulaba.
That was it, but not in that way.	Ekyo kye kyali, naye si mu ngeri eyo.
That's my point.	Eyo y'ensonga yange.
She looks good and beautiful.	Alabika bulungi era nga mulungi.
Or rather really really.	Oba okusinga ddala ddala.
It will always stay with me.	Bulijjo kijja kusigala nange.
I didn’t care at all	Nnali sifaayo n’akatono
Why, he will never do anything again.	Lwaki, tajja kuddamu kukola kintu kyonna.
I have here what he said.	Nnina wano kye yayogera.
We can’t wait.	Tetusobola kulinda.
It won’t be easy, and it won’t be easy.	Tekijja kuba kyangu, era tekijja kuba kyangu.
However, I am not like you.	Kyokka siri nga ggwe.
It’s nothing serious, really, though.	Si kintu kya maanyi, ddala, naye.
I can’t do it alone	Nze sisobola kukikola nzekka
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
I could have gone.	Nnali nsobola okugenda.
I guess there is a reason	Ntebereza nti waliwo ensonga lwaki
I’m sure you’d like some time to yourself	Nkakasa nti wandyagadde akaseera ku ggwe kennyini
In this case, it is.	Mu mbeera eno, bwe kiri.
He didn’t have much time.	Yali talina budde bungi.
And very, very quickly.	Era mu bwangu nnyo nnyo.
I think you would like it	Ndowooza wandyagadde
I didn’t know what was going to happen	Nnali simanyi kyali kigenda kubaawo
You can’t be everything to everyone.	Tosobola kuba buli kimu eri buli muntu.
I was young, strong and fast	Nali muto, nga ndi wa maanyi era nga ndi wa bwangu
And we can’t let that happen.	Era ekyo tetusobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
This is simply not true.	Kino si kituufu kyokka.
You can’t do this.	Kino tosobola kukikola.
But no, it’s not really mine.	Naye nedda, mu butuufu si yange.
I still can’t quite believe it	N’okutuusa kati sisobola bulungi kukkiriza
Make.	Okukola.
No, my son.	Nedda mwana wange.
I could feel his hunger	Nnali mpulira enjala ye
But it’s not just one.	Naye si kimu kyokka.
He's obviously going to come at you.	Kya lwatu agenda kujja ku ggwe.
I didn’t think he needed a phone	Essimu nnali sirowooza nti yali yeetaaga
However, that’s not really the point.	Kyokka, mu butuufu eyo si y’ensonga.
I was expecting dinner soon	Nali nsuubira ekyeggulo mu bbanga ttono
But you can talk to him.	Naye osobola okwogera naye.
But he really thought so.	Naye ddala yalowooza bw’atyo.
He is very sick.	Mulwadde nnyo.
We deserve more than that.	Ffe tusaanidde okusinga ekyo.
I can’t tell if that’s a good thing or not	Sisobola kumanya oba ekyo kintu kirungi oba nedda
I know he is a good man	Nkimanyi nti musajja mulungi
From you.	Okuva ku ggwe.
I can’t stay with you	Sisobola kusigala naawe
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
I had no one and nothing	Nnali sirina muntu yenna era nga sirina kintu kyonna
That was what he was doing.	Ekyo yali akikola.
I think we can do this	Ndowooza kino tusobola okukikola
You won’t, you know.	Tojja kukikola, omanyi.
He was a very thoughtful man	Yali musajja alowooza nnyo
I am a good child.	Ndi mwana mulungi.
I just wanted to go home now	Nnali njagala kudda waka kyokka kati
I will be back though	Nja kudda wadde
I'll be back in time	Nja kudda mu budde
I couldn’t speak.	Nnali sisobola kwogera.
Everyone is friendly.	Buli muntu wa mukwano.
This is the only one.	Kino kyokka.
I am in luck.	Nze ndi mu mukisa.
That’s what it’s like to watch this movie.	Ekyo bwe kiri okulaba firimu eno.
I just wanted to talk to you about something	Nnali njagala kwogera naawe ku kintu kyokka
I have no space to speak at all	Sirina kifo kya kwogera n’akatono
That’s good to know.	Ekyo kirungi okumanya.
As he was.	Nga bwe yali.
We will do it your way.	Tujja kukikola mu ngeri yo.
The best winner!.	Asinga okuwangula!.
Like that was really going to happen.	Nga ekyo ddala kyali kigenda kubaawo.
He was ready for that.	Ekyo yali mwetegefu.
I can’t tell what they are	Sisobola kumanya kye bali
I couldn’t do it	Nnali siyinza kukikola
There is something for everyone in this.	Mu kino mulimu ekintu eri buli muntu.
But not really.	Naye si ddala.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
I wonder who I should tell	Nneebuuza ani gwe nnina okubuulira
You know that as well as anyone.	Ekyo okimanyi bulungi nga omuntu yenna.
He was sick	Yali mulwadde .
Nothing is easy.	Tewali kintu kyangu.
I didn’t know what he was doing	Nnali simanyi kye yali akola
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
I think it’s true.	Ndowooza nti kituufu.
And it’s very difficult.	Era kizibu nnyo.
You move on from here.	Ggwe ogenda mu maaso okuva wano.
Or he thought he had.	Oba yalowooza nti alina.
No one was going anywhere.	Tewali yali agenda yonna.
Saying anything at all.	Okwogera kintu kyonna n’akatono.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera.
I was feeling pretty good already	Nali mpulira bulungi nnyo dda
I'm going to move on.	Nze ngenda mu maaso.
Or your dog.	Oba embwa yo.
He hits the floor.	Akuba wansi.
I know you can do it baby	Nkimanyi osobola okukikola mwana wange
It will be you.	Kijja kuba ggwe.
There is no reason not to.	Tewali nsonga lwaki tolina.
And, as .	Era, nga .
You’ve always been.	Bulijjo obadde.
I’m so scared	Nze ntya nnyo
I absolutely love it!.	Njagala nnyo ddala!.
He will be.	Ajja kuba.
He said it was for his own good.	Yagambye nti kyali kya bulungi bwe.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
He is in the front.	Ye mu maaso.
You will be strong.	Ojja kuba wa maanyi.
I’m not going to talk to you anymore	Sigenda kuddamu kwogera naawe
I hope I can get as good as you	Nsuubira nange nsobola okufuna obulungi nga ggwe
However, it was much easier.	Kyokka, kyali kyangu nnyo.
The reason why you are there	Ensonga lwaki oli awo
Everyone knows we’re best friends.	Buli omu akimanyi nti tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
There is no help whatsoever.	Tewali buyambi bwonna.
Someone getting things.	Omuntu okufuna ebintu.
I was sure it wouldn’t work	Nali nkakasa nti tekijja kukola
In that position.	Mu kifo ekyo.
She looks great and she knows it.	Alabika bulungi nnyo era akimanyi.
No one heard it.	Tewali yawulira.
Only a person does that.	Ekyo omuntu yekka akikola.
A little like me last week	Katono nga nze wiiki ewedde
This is what it is.	Kino kye kiri.
He didn't know why he was doing that, but it seemed right.	Tamanyi lwaki yali akola ekyo naye nga kirabika kituufu.
The other couldn’t do it.	Omulala yali tasobola kukikola.
I always feel great	Bulijjo mpulira nnyo
I don’t want you to talk to him.	Saagala naawe okwogera naye.
We have to do the work.	Tulina okukola omulimu.
I think he would like to know about all this	Ndowooza yandiyagadde okumanya ku bino byonna
We both have it.	Ffembi tulina.
I can never have you	Siyinza n’akatono okuba naawe
Very good for you.	Kirungi nnyo gyoli.
And tomorrow we will go.	Era enkya tujja kugenda.
He felt very comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo.
But not for very long.	Naye si bbanga ddene nnyo.
I couldn’t live with myself.	Nnali sisobola kubeera nange kennyini.
This is no more true of the product.	Kino si kituufu okusinga ku kintu ekyo.
No one is happy with me or anyone else.	Tewali musanyufu nange wadde omuntu omulala yenna.
It’s hard to say.	Kizibu okwogera.
I thought for a moment.	Nalowooza okumala akaseera.
I'll drive.	Nja kuvuga.
Nothing there for a long time.	Tewali kintu kyonna awo okumala ebbanga ddene.
I'll be there in an hour	Nja kubeerawo mu ssaawa emu
Either way, something is going to happen.	Mu ngeri yonna, waliwo ekigenda okubaawo.
I want to go with you	Njagala kugenda naawe
He worked hard and was also very lucky.	Yakola nnyo era naye yalina omukisa nnyo.
It’s going to be great for you.	Kigenda kuba kirungi nnyo gy’oli.
When he was a child.	Nga akyali mwana muto.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo kye yakola.
I can’t do it.	Nze sisobola kukikola.
I want in the.	Njagala mu.
I was nervous all week	Wiiki yonna nnali ntya
You can say whatever you want.	Osobola okwogera kyonna ky’oyagala.
He needed time alone.	Yali yeetaaga obudde yekka.
Or so it was.	Oba bwe kyali.
I’m sure you would like it.	Nkakasa nti wandyagadde.
I can’t see anything	Siyinza kulaba kintu kyonna
I'm not sure exactly when	Sikakasa ddi ddala ddi
I will never do it again.	Sijja kuddamu kukikola.
You have no idea what’s going on.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
I love being here.	Njagala nnyo okubeera wano.
I’m not in this for the money	Siri mu kino lwa ssente
This morning would be good.	Enkya ya leero yandibadde nnungi.
I want to go now.	Njagala kugenda kati.
That’s what’s wrong.	Ekyo kye kiri kibi.
I am very happy now.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo kati.
He is at this position.	Ali ku kifo kino.
I really needed that	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga nnyo
He'll come.	Ajja kujja.
That was good for me.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
We are friends now.	Tuli ba mukwano kati.
But you have to do it.	Naye olina okukikola.
It is very, very true.	Kituufu nnyo nnyo.
I wanted to be like him	Nnali njagala kubeera nga ye
But he is a human being.	Naye ye muntu.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
And it's difficult '.	Era kizibu '.
You can’t go on.	Tosobola kugenda mu maaso.
They were too close to work.	Baali kumpi nnyo okukola.
I didn’t know what he was doing	Nnali simanyi kye yali akola
However, it is not true.	Kyokka, si kituufu.
In my own city.	Mu kibuga kyange.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
That is my problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyange.
That may be true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
I suppose that is my problem	Nsuubira nti ekyo kye kizibu kyange
That is a very serious point.	Eyo nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
But you know who knows.	Naye omanyi ani amanyi.
This was going to be close.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kumpi.
It looks great.	Kirabika nnyo.
I expected to back off	Nali nsuubira okudda emabega
It looks very, very good.	Kirabika nnyo nnyo.
Very good though.	Kirungi nnyo wadde.
I think you’re on to something.	Ndowooza oli ku kintu.
But he was here.	Naye yali wano.
I wasn’t sure it was real	Nali sikakasa nti kyali kya ddala
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
And one can see why	Era omuntu asobola okulaba lwaki
To say we can do better.	Okugamba nti tusobola okukola obulungi.
I am a good friend.	Nze mukwano omulungi.
I love being with you	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe
Or if there is.	Oba nga waliwo.
I am one myself.	Nze kennyini ndi omu.
It's a good night.	Ekiro kirungi.
I think you know where this is going	Ndowooza omanyi kino gye kigenda
I won’t do it tonight	Sijja kukikola ekiro kino
He didn’t want to go, and that was that.	Yali tayagala kugenda, era ekyo kye kyali.
It was mine now.	Yali yange kati.
I am always the same	Bulijjo ndi kye kimu
Whether you like it or not.	Oba oyagala oba toyagala.
I don’t want to believe anything.	Saagala kukkiriza kintu kyonna.
I hope someone steps forward	Nsuubira waliwo agenda mu maaso
He was hungry.	Yalina enjala.
That’s not really true.	Ekyo mu butuufu si kituufu.
It will come.	Kijja kujja.
I didn’t think it would happen.	Nnali sirowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
You are not in this.	Toli mu nsonga eno.
The food was there.	Emmere yali awo.
No one would know.	Tewali yandibadde amanyi.
This is my job.	Guno gwe mulimu gwange.
I can’t do anything right	Sisobola kukola kintu kyonna kituufu
I was actually a little nervous	Mu butuufu nnali ntya katono
I don’t care about you.	Sifaayo ku ggwe.
I don’t have time for this	Kino sirina budde
We were going, though.	Twali tugenda, naye.
I can’t live without it	Sisobola kubeerawo nga sirina
I can’t wait to do it again!	Siyinza kulinda kuddamu kukikola!
I guess now he knows	Ntebereza kati amanyi
However, here he was.	Kyokka, wano we yali.
Here it is.	Wano we wali.
I had no idea it would be so bad.	Nali sirina kirowoozo nti kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
Or me too.	Oba nze nange.
You said it was happening before, and it wasn’t.	Wagamba nti kyali kigenda mu maaso emabegako, era si bwe kyali.
I could do the same, or not	Nze nnali nsobola okukola kye kimu, oba nedda
I needed it.	Nnali nneetaaga.
Perhaps that’s why he looked alone.	Oboolyawo y’ensonga lwaki yali alabika yekka.
I do but this is very difficult	Nze nkola naye kino kizibu nnyo
Nothing is alone.	Tewali kintu kyonna kye kiri kyokka.
I think that we will	Ndowooza nti tujja kukikola
I was home in time for dinner.	Nnali waka mu budde okulya ekyeggulo.
And that was certainly an issue.	Era ekyo mazima ddala kyali nsonga.
It’s hard to go.	Kizibu okugenda.
I’m not busy.	Nze siri bbize.
That is why you are here today.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki oli wano leero.
Everything in the room was great.	Buli kimu mu kisenge kyali kirungi nnyo.
You know that about me.	Ekyo okimanyi ku nze.
I know that’s not your job.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo si kye mulimu.
I guess you have.	Ntebereza nti olina.
I need to be alone for a while	Nze nneetaaga okubeera nzekka okumala akaseera
We cannot talk about what he did.	Tetusobola kwogera ku ekyo kye yakola.
I knew something was going on here.	Namanya nti wano waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
I was so scared	Nnali ntya nnyo
This was the plan.	Eno ye yali enteekateeka.
I do like my wife.	Nze nkola nga mukyala wange.
I hope he is okay	Nsuubira nti talina buzibu bwonna
Maybe if we were.	Mpozzi singa ffe.
I don’t know myself.	Nze kennyini simanyi.
Unless, of course, that person is you.	Okuggyako nga, ddala, omuntu oyo ye ggwe.
I wanted to do well in class	Nnali njagala okukola obulungi mu kibiina
However, it is not him.	Kyokka si ye.
Here, he had everything he wanted.	Wano, yalina buli kimu kye yali ayagala.
This is a movie.	Eno firimu.
I wasn’t sure that.	Nali sikakasa nti.
But right now, that’s a problem.	Naye mu kiseera kino, ekyo kizibu.
You have three hours.	Olina essaawa ssatu.
I knew they were here	Namanya nti baali wano
I didn’t know anyone	Nnali sirina gwe mmanyi
Forward.	Mu maaso.
I knew who was who	Nali mmanyi wa ani wa ani
I could say anything	Nnali nsobola okwogera ekintu kyonna
I was on my way home	Nnali ngenda okudda eka
I’ll never do that again, you know that	Ekyo sijja kuddamu kukikola, ekyo okimanyi
He doesn’t have to do that.	Ekyo talina kukikola.
That, of course, is not the case.	Ekyo, ddala, si bwe kiri.
In fact, this is not entirely true.	Mu butuufu kino si kituufu ddala.
I’m not really ready.	Mu butuufu siri mwetegefu.
It was a difficult time for everyone.	Kyali kiseera kizibu eri buli muntu.
I knew what it was though	Nali mmanyi kye kyali wadde
We probably need to talk face to face.	Oboolyawo twetaaga okwogera maaso ku maaso.
I live here.	Nze mbeera wano.
I can’t wait!.	Siyinza kulinda!.
I have something with you.	Nze naawe nnina kye nnina.
We have something for everyone.	Tulina kye tulina eri buli muntu.
I can’t say exactly why	Siyinza kwogera bulungi lwaki
I was his only child	Nze nali mwana we yekka
I just didn’t know what it was	Nze nali simanyi kye kyali kyokka
We have to get to the bottom of this.	Tulina okutuuka wansi ku nsonga eno.
, .	, .
But that’s not what’s happening.	Naye ekyo si kye kigenda mu maaso.
Police are.	Poliisi eri...
I wonder what he would do	Nneebuuza kye yandikoze
I don't know what the problem is.	Simanyi buzibu ki.
You really are.	Ggwe ddala oli.
Everything is fine so far.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi okutuuka wano.
I was feeling desperate	Nnali mpulira nga nfunye essuubi
He wanted to go.	Yali ayagala kugenda.
He thought it was pretty good.	Yalowooza nti kirungi nnyo.
I am in no great hurry to go home	Siri mu bwangu bwa maanyi kudda waka
I can already do that	Ekyo nsobola dda okukikola
I want to know he’s going to be okay	Njagala okumanya nti agenda kuba bulungi
And it likely won’t happen.	Era kirabika tekijja kubaawo.
That will help.	Ekyo kijja kuyamba.
I thought that was it.	Nnali ndowooza nti ekyo kye kyali.
I’m just happy.	Nze ndi musanyufu kyokka.
He has, of course he has.	Alina, ddala alina.
I really can’t do it	Mazima ddala sisobola kukikola
I wasn’t quite sure which.	Nali sikakasa bulungi ki.
It's mine.	Ye yange.
Now it will work fine.	Kati kijja kukola bulungi.
But not just anything.	Naye si kintu kyonna kyokka.
That’s where it is.	Eyo gye kiri.
I wondered what he was doing, what he was thinking	Nneebuuza kye yali akola, kye yali alowooza
I didn’t know what he was talking about.	Nnali simanyi kye yali ayogera.
I know he was in the hospital for a long time.	Nkimanyi nti yali mu ddwaaliro okumala ebbanga ddene.
But that’s a good thing.	Naye ekyo kirungi.
He doesn't have it.	Talina.
It was a matter of work.	Yali nsonga ya mulimu.
It’s not realistic.	Si kya ddala.
I’m not here to make friends	Siri wano kukola mikwano
This is not the place for you.	Kino si kifo gy’oli.
And it’s still there.	Era n’okutuusa kati.
It doesn’t matter where it is.	Si kikulu gye kiri.
Really.	Kituufu.
He was very happy about that.	Ekyo yali musanyufu nnyo.
I’m really scared.	Nze ddala ntya.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
He didn't know what was going on.	Yali tamanyi kigenda mu maaso.
He's still good though.	Akyali mulungi wadde.
Or you may not have.	Oba oyinza okuba nga tolina.
That it might just be him.	Nti kiyinza okuba nga ye yekka.
This was a very difficult time.	Kino kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
And he could see why.	Era yali asobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
Answer.	Okuddamu.
He was going to do it.	Yali agenda kukikola.
I can’t talk to anyone about it	Sisobola kwogera na muntu yenna ku nsonga eyo
You can do it here, now.	Osobola okukikola wano, kati.
It’s not too bad.	Si kibi nnyo.
But what he said.	Naye bye yayogera.
That's what it is, but this is what it is.	Ebyo bye bino, naye bino bye ebyo.
I need to know what’s going on	Nnina okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
It’s just that thing.	Kye kintu ekyo kyokka.
It was ordinary.	Kyali kya bulijjo.
And it’s pretty good.	Era kirungi nnyo.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
This is absolutely true.	Kino kituufu ddala.
He knows his cars.	Amanyi mmotoka ze.
He didn’t want to wait.	Yali tayagala kulinda.
He was fine himself.	Ye kennyini yali bulungi.
But here we can win.	Naye wano tusobola okuwangula.
I don’t want to talk to him either	Nange saagala kwogera naye
I was actually planning to do the same thing	Mu butuufu nnali nteekateeka okukola ekintu kye kimu
He is anything but that.	Ye kintu kyonna okuggyako ekyo.
I knew you would come	Namanya nti ojja kujja
I knew this was coming.	Namanya nti kino kyali kijja.
I knew there was something	Nali mmanyi nti waliwo ekintu
That is the whole problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyonna.
This is much less common than it seems.	Kino si kya bulijjo nnyo okusinga bwe kirabika.
You don’t have to do that.	Ekyo tolina kukikola.
I still don’t know.	Nze n’okutuusa kati simanyi.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
I know that it was.	Nkimanyi nti bwe kyali.
From there, we’ll get what we can.	Okuva awo, tujja kufuna kye tusobola.
I won’t be on the bus for very long again	Sijja kuddamu kubeera mu bbaasi okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo
I was there too.	Nze nange nnali awo.
I would love to know where it is now	Njagala nnyo okumanya gye kiri kati
I can’t be the only one who knows	Siyinza kuba nze nzekka amanyi
You.	Ggwe.
My father was very reluctant.	Taata yali tayagala nnyo.
It was early in the morning.	Yali ku makya ennyo.
Anything you want.	Ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala.
I wish I could be that	Njagala nnyo okubeera oyo
It’s the same thing.	Kye kimu.
I love everyone at home	Njagala nnyo buli muntu awaka
I really do, you know.	Nze ddala nkola, omanyi.
You’ll see.	Ojja kulaba.
I know they are in great danger	Nkimanyi nti bali mu bulabe bungi
I expected to say no	Nali nsuubira okugamba nti nedda
I was very young and ignorant	Nnali muto nnyo era nga simanyi
I feel so much better now.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo kati.
This is why.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki...
I guess it had.	Ntebereza nti kyalina.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
It was so quick and fast	Yali ya mangu nnyo era nga ya mangu
None of this will be a problem.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kijja kuba kizibu.
That was it .	Ekyo kye kyali .
He is behind this.	Ali emabega wa kino.
I want you to want me too	Njagala naawe nange oyagala
In fact, they were.	Mu butuufu, baali.
I knew nothing about it.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
I like spending time together	Njagala nnyo okumala obudde nga tugenda mu maaso
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
Although it is difficult.	Wadde nga kizibu.
Then he said he wanted to have me in him.	Awo n’agamba nti ayagala kubeera nange mu ye.
It’s time, he thought.	Kye kiseera, bwe yalowooza.
He doesn’t want to do anything in this regard.	Tayagala kukola kintu kyonna mu nsonga eno.
He told me that.	Yangamba ekyo.
I love everybody.	Njagala nnyo buli muntu.
I thought it would work	Nalowooza nti kijja kukola
But it was so close.	Naye nga kiri kumpi nnyo.
As simple as that.	Nga kyangu nga ekyo.
No one spoke.	Tewali yayogera.
I can’t do this myself	Kino sisobola kukikola nze kennyini
I think that, under everything, he did	Ndowooza nti, wansi wa buli kimu, yakikola
I had no idea what it could be	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki kye kiyinza okuba
In a way, this is good.	Mu ngeri emu, kino kirungi.
No way back home for me.	Tewali ngeri ya kudda waka gyendi.
It is as true now as it was then.	Kituufu kati nga bwe kyali mu kiseera ekyo.
That will be very helpful.	Ekyo kijja kuyamba nnyo.
It is very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo.
I think this.	Nze ndowooza kino.
But he didn’t need to see.	Naye yali teyeetaaga kulaba.
I don’t know why this is happening	Simanyi lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso
Dogs are good at that.	Embwa nnungi ku ekyo.
Back to the.	Okudda ku...
I can’t believe you haven’t	Siyinza kukkiriza nti tolina
And it would and it is.	Era kyandibadde era bwe kiri.
I can’t do it myself	Nze kennyini sisobola kukikola
Front view, side view.	Okulaba mu maaso, okulaba ku ludda.
From anything.	Okuva mu kintu kyonna.
I hope you are well.	Nsuubira nti oli bulungi.
He was good at making money fast.	Yali mulungi mu kukola ssente mu bwangu.
You have to go.	Olina okugenda.
He is still in excellent shape.	N’okutuusa kati akyali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
He looks strong and powerful.	Alabika nga wa maanyi era nga wa maanyi.
I want to be good at something	Njagala okuba omulungi mu kintu
I was the same in a way	Nze nali kye kimu mu ngeri emu
I won’t even talk to him	Sijja na kwogera naye
This is not a movie.	Eno si firimu.
There is no plan.	Tewali nteekateeka yonna.
But he couldn’t accept her help.	Naye yali tasobola kukkiriza buyambi bwe.
I didn’t know what to do, how to do it	Nali simanyi kya kukola, ngeri ki gye nnali nkola
Probably a long time.	Oboolyawo ebbanga ddene.
I have had to do it too	Nange mbadde nnina okukikola
I have to think a lot.	Nnina okulowooza bingi.
Nothing easy about it.	Tewali kyangu ku nsonga eyo.
He can’t see, of course.	Tasobola kulaba, ddala.
I really wanted to go.	Nnali njagala nnyo okugenda.
I think everything will come back to me quickly.	Ndowooza buli kimu kijja kudda gye ndi mu bwangu.
Back here.	Okudda wano.
The film did very well	Firimu eno yakola bulungi nnyo
I was in him, we were one	Nali mu ye, twali kimu
That’s pretty easy.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo.
I think he is very good at his job	Ndowooza mulungi nnyo mu mulimu gwe
That is a serious problem.	Ekyo kizibu kya maanyi.
That was what it was going to be.	Ekyo kye kyali kigenda okubeera.
I will be fine with myself	Nja kuba bulungi nzekka
This is not your issue.	Eno si nsonga yo.
I wanted to stay there.	Nnali njagala kusigala awo.
But there is a problem with this.	Naye waliwo obuzibu ku kino.
I know what he wants to do	Nze mmanyi ky’ayagala okukola
I think every kid should	Ndowooza buli mwana yandibadde
And you know what.	Era ggwe omanyi ki.
He is a really nice person.	Ye muntu mulungi ddala.
He really has a point.	Ddala alina ensonga.
That person is ourselves.	Omuntu oyo tuli ffe kennyini.
I couldn’t find anyone	Nnali sisobola kufuna muntu yenna
You could do this, you know.	Kino oyinza okukikola, omanyi.
But he thought it might help.	Naye yalowooza nti kiyinza okuyamba.
I had no choice.	Nnali sirina kya kukola.
We cannot accept this view.	Tetusobola kukkiriza ndowooza eno.
I have to be in the hospital	Nnina okubeera mu ddwaaliro
I had no reason why.	Nnali sirina nsonga lwaki.
She was beautiful and effective.	Yali mulungi era ng’akola bulungi.
You have no idea it’s happening.	Tolina kirowoozo nti kigenda mu maaso.
Or he would have.	Oba yandibadde.
I had no time for anything	Nnali sirina budde bwa kintu kyonna
I wondered how much he knew	Nneebuuza nti yali amanyi bingi nnyo
He can do what he wants.	Asobola okukola ky’ayagala.
Really sick, too.	Ddala mulwadde, naye.
He doesn’t want one.	Tayagala emu.
He's just that good.	Ye mulungi bw'atyo yekka.
He knows how to get what he wants.	Amanyi okufuna ky’ayagala.
I just needed space	Nnali nneetaaga kifo kyokka
You really can’t win.	Mazima ddala tosobola kuwangula.
It’s nothing to me.	Si kintu kyonna gyendi.
It’s who we are and what we are.	Kye tuli ani era kye tuli.
It certainly looks good.	Mazima ddala kirabika bulungi.
I hope it will wait	Nsuubira nti kijja kulinda
I loved it so much	Nnali njagala nnyo nnyo
You may be the same.	Oyinza okuba nga naawe.
I can’t wait to go	Siyinza kulinda kugenda
Nothing of the sort was true.	Tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo kyali kituufu.
Perhaps that was true.	Oboolyawo ekyo kyali kituufu.
That it was.	Nti bwe kyali.
Probably too soon.	Oboolyawo mangu nnyo.
But they were there now.	Naye baali awo kati.
I want to play in one	Njagala kuzannya mu kimu
He said he didn't know.	Yagambye nti tamanyi.
That was my father.	Oyo ye yali taata wange.
I knew it wouldn’t happen soon enough	Namanya nti tekijja kubaawo mangu ddala
And it was there.	Era kyali awo.
I was busy down there	Nali bbize wansi awo
We don’t have a problem.	Tetulina buzibu.
Someone has to be.	Omuntu alina okuba.
I guess you are very popular.	Ntebereza nti oli muganzi nnyo.
That’s the place.	Ekyo kye kifo.
He will try to work.	Ajja kugezaako okukola.
I love things.	Njagala nnyo ebintu.
I didn’t know how well they were	Nnali simanyi bulungi bwe baali
But, that’s not the point.	Naye, eyo si y’ensonga.
And only one thing.	Era ekintu kimu kyokka.
I can’t answer at all	Sisobola kuddamu n’akatono
Phone yesterday	Essimu eggulo
From the scene.	Okuva mu kifo.
Maybe I should go home	Oboolyawo nsaanidde okudda eka
I have no idea who he was	Sirina kye mmanyi nti yali ani
He needed help.	Yali yeetaaga obuyambi.
Tonight I deserved it	Ekiro kino nnali nsaanidde
I was very, very lucky	Nali wa mukisa nnyo nnyo
He is still her friend.	Akyali mukwano gwe.
I have only one brother myself	Nze kennyini nnina muganda wange omu yekka
Now we are.	Kati tuli.
We just have it.	Tulina kyokka.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I guess that's where it is.	Ntebereza awo we kiri.
He didn't seem to know what to say.	Yalabika nga tamanyi kya kwogera.
It’s not a good feeling.	Si mpulira nnungi.
I didn’t know what to expect	Nnali simanyi kye nsuubira
I wanted to know what he was doing	Nnali njagala okumanya kye yali akola
It’s not good at all.	Si kirungi n’akatono.
I can’t believe you are	Siyinza kukkiriza nti oli
I didn’t know it.	Nze nali simanyi.
And, it was.	Era, bwe kyali.
I was curious what that was like	Nali njagala nnyo okumanya engeri ekyo gye kiri
You don’t have to try.	Tolina kugezaako.
You don’t have much time.	Tolina budde bungi.
This is all he needs.	Kino kyokka kye yeetaaga.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
I know he wants to play	Nkimanyi ayagala kuzannya
He couldn’t see much.	Yali tasobola kulaba bingi.
Easy to say, very hard to do.	Kyangu okwogera, kizibu nnyo okukola.
I didn’t know he was	Nnali simanyi nti bw’atyo
And neither is it with you.	Era naawe si bwe kiri.
Not for you, certainly not.	Si lwa ggwe, mazima si bwe kiri.
It will be good.	Kijja kuba kirungi.
He would have been like that.	Yandibadde bw’atyo.
I have to read this book	Nnina okusoma ekitabo kino
Nobody says anything.	Tewali ayogera kintu kyonna.
I want to do the right thing	Njagala kukola kituufu
I wasn’t sure if he had finished	Nali sikakasa oba yali amaze
I have to go make a phone call	Nnina okugenda okukuba essimu
I knew he was doing well	Namanya nti yali agenda bulungi
I was very sick.	Nnali mulwadde nnyo.
I thought you should know, that’s all	Nalowooza nti olina okumanya, ekyo kyokka
On his part.	Ku ludda lwe.
I always wanted to be alone	Bulijjo nnali njagala kubeera nzekka
I always wanted to be with him	Bulijjo nnali njagala nnyo okubeera naye
This is so bad, my son.	Kino kibi nnyo mwana wange.
I probably won’t go anyway	Oboolyawo sijja kugenda mu ngeri yonna
But now we need to move on.	Naye kati twetaaga okugenda mu maaso.
I think he would be pretty good	Ndowooza yandibadde mulungi nnyo
And you have to be that	Era olina okuba ekyo
I’m not sure why.	Sikakasa lwaki.
But he agreed to do the same.	Naye naye yakkiriza okukola kye kimu.
Today, however, there is hope.	Kyokka, leero waliwo essuubi.
It’s not a problem for me.	Si buzibu gyendi.
He was a young child.	Yali mwana muto.
We have to go.	Tulina okugenda.
I wanted to get back to my job	Nnali njagala kudda mu mulimu gwange
That was very important to us.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
I needed to talk to him	Nnali nneetaaga okwogera naye
I can’t keep doing this	Kino sisobola kusigala nga nkola
But my father.	Naye taata wange.
You should be good to go.	Olina okuba omulungi okugenda.
I will be anything you want me to be	Nja kuba ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala okuba
And my, what a week to watch, too.	Era wange, nga wiiki ki okulaba, nange.
I know you really do like him	Nkimanyi nti ddala okola nga ye
I have no idea how long	Sirina kirowoozo ku bbanga ki
This is certainly good.	Mazima ddala kino kirungi.
I hope it comes soon	Nsuubira nti kijja mangu
I am beautiful she thought	Ndi mulungi bwe yalowooza
If only it were this easy.	Singa kyali kyangu kino kyokka.
I just want to be with you	Njagala kubeera naawe kyokka
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
You are very young indeed.	Oli muto nnyo ddala.
I don’t want to go on	Saagala kugenda mu maaso
You should definitely go.	Mazima ddala olina okugenda.
He is very sick.	Ali mulwadde nnyo.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
I’ve had trouble getting money.	Nze nfunye obuzibu okufuna ssente.
No, no, absolutely.	Nedda, nedda, ddala.
No, you are not.	Nedda, ggwe si bwe kiri.
I think he knows where this is going	Ndowooza kino akimanyi gye kigenda
But no one said you couldn’t do this.	Naye tewali yagamba nti kino tosobola kukikola.
How beautiful she was.	Nga yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
In force to.	Mu maanyi okutuuka.
But I can’t do it.	Naye sisobola kukikola.
He is my son.	Ye mwana wange.
He is talking about us.	Ayogera ku ffe.
He had been thinking.	Yali abadde alowooza.
Don’t go any further.	Togenda mu maaso.
No, he doesn’t.	Nedda, alina.
He didn’t even want to.	Yali tayagala wadde.
Indeed it was.	Mazima bwe kyali.
Like a man.	Nga musajja.
I have no plans and I feel good	Sirina nteekateeka yonna era mpulira bulungi
I'm not even sure what exactly	Sikakasa na kiki ddala
You’ve been working very, very hard.	Obadde okola nnyo nnyo.
And you always said you wouldn’t.	Era bulijjo wagamba nti tojja kukikola.
Today that person is me.	Leero omuntu oyo nze.
Maybe it’s not something everyone has.	Mpozzi si kintu buli muntu ky’alina.
I have no intention of going from here	Sirina kirowoozo kya kugenda okuva wano
Someone you can.	Oli oyinza.
You said you would.	Wagamba nti ojja kukikola.
I have to go now.	Nnina okugenda kati.
Or it can be very difficult.	Oba kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza.
You won’t even love.	Tojja na kwagala.
I didn’t know what that was	Ekyo nnali simanyi kye kyali
Soon everyone was doing it.	Mu bbanga ttono buli omu yali akikola.
This was at home.	Kino kyali waka.
I know you don’t know.	Nkimanyi nti tomanyi.
This was worse than he thought it could be.	Kino kyali kibi nnyo okusinga bwe yali alowooza nti kiyinza okuba.
Almost anything he wanted.	Kumpi ekintu kyonna kye yali ayagala.
I didn’t know what to do or say	Nnali simanyi kya kukola oba kya kwogera
It would be nice.	Kyandibadde kirungi.
I wanted none of this	Nnali saagala kintu kyonna ku bino
I know you’ll be fine	Nkimanyi nti ojja kuba bulungi
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
I want to be him.	Njagala kubeera ye.
From what is this .	Okuva ku kiki kino .
I have somewhere to go	Nnina we ngenda
I am so sorry to say	Nsonyiwa nnyo okugamba
Everything except you.	Byonna okuggyako ggwe.
I wanted to go.	Nnali njagala kugenda.
That was the one.	Oyo ye yali omu.
I’m not sure, of course	Sikakasa, ddala
I am doing my job.	Nkola omulimu gwange.
Everything would be bad.	Buli kimu kyandibadde kibi.
This is a beautiful place.	Kino kifo kirungi nnyo.
Everyone wants to see the facts.	Buli omu ayagala okulaba ensonga.
And maybe not.	Era mpozzi nedda.
Maybe that was it.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kyali.
No one but me.	Tewali muntu yenna okuggyako nze.
I just want to talk to you.	Njagala kwogera naawe kyokka.
I know nothing about him	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ye
I know you know that though.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo okimanyi wadde.
Although it is now.	Wadde nga kati bwe kiri.
It’s really difficult.	Ddala kizibu.
Works quickly came on said day on time.	Akola mangu yajja ku lunaku lwe yagamba mu budde.
I thought he was doing pretty well	Nalowooza nti yali akola bulungi nnyo
And you’re going to see a lot more from us.	Era ogenda kulaba bingi nnyo okuva gye tuli.
You’re doing a good job.	Okola omulimu mulungi.
It was mine too.	Nange kyali kyange.
We have a problem here	Tulina ekizibu wano
I feel pretty good about anything.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo ku kintu kyonna.
I couldn’t believe how hard it was	Nali siyinza kukkiriza ngeri gye kyali kizibu
In a way he loves it.	Mu ngeri emu ayagala nnyo.
There was nothing he could do better.	Tewali kye yali asobola kukola bulungi.
But it’s really hard now.	Naye ddala kizibu nnyo kati.
You know that as well as anyone.	Ekyo okimanyi bulungi nga omuntu yenna.
It was so close.	Yali kumpi nnyo.
And maybe that’s a good thing.	Era mpozzi ekyo kintu kirungi.
Must be currently working.	Alina okuba ng’akola mu kiseera kino.
He'll be home tomorrow.	Ajja kudda waka enkya.
You’ll see why, very soon.	Ojja kulaba lwaki, mu bbanga ttono ddala.
This is a tremendous opportunity.	Guno mukisa gwa maanyi nnyo.
I need to talk to him about something	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye ku kintu
We will do that.	Ekyo tujja kukikola.
That was in my car.	Ekyo kyali mu mmotoka yange.
It’s going to be important	Kigenda kuba kikulu
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
It was what it seemed.	Kye kyali kirabika.
I feel so happy and happy	Mpulira nga ndi musanyufu nnyo era nga ndi musanyufu
I can’t be that person	Siyinza kuba muntu oyo
I am now the only brother.	Kati ndi muganda omu yekka.
I hope this continues	Nsuubira nti kino kigenda mu maaso
There is one police station in the town	Mu kibuga kino mulimu poliisi emu
Not just me, but you.	Si nze nzekka, naye ggwe.
I'll do it	Nja kukikola
This is certainly the case.	Kino mazima ddala bwe kiri.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
I know he is a child	Nkimanyi nti ye mwana
You would like to know.	Wandyagadde okumanya.
I want to know who it is	Njagala kumanya ani
And for me, that was it.	Era nze, ekyo kye kyali.
I know it’s there.	Nkimanyi nti kiri awo.
And it’s not that easy.	Era si kyangu nnyo.
And it will work.	Era kijja kukola.
It doesn’t matter right now.	Si kikulu mu kiseera kino.
I didn't know him well, but he's friendly	Nze nali simanyi bulungi naye wa mukwano
He wanted himself.	Yali ayagala ye kennyini.
I hope so.	Nsuubira.
I know what a house is	Nze mmanyi ennyumba kye ki
That’s what we’re going to do here.	Ekyo kye tugenda okukola wano.
He is very afraid.	Atya nnyo.
It was an idea to do it again at the time.	Kyali kirowoozo kya kuddamu kukikola mu kiseera ekyo.
I was really happy	Nnali musanyufu ddala
But someone who has.	Naye omuntu alina...
He had to get out of here.	Yalina okuva wano.
I expected something like this.	Nali nsuubira ekintu nga kino.
Probably like you.	Oboolyawo nga ggwe.
The day, without trouble	Olunaku, nga tewali buzibu
I think it’s the same with me and him.	Ndowooza bwe kiri ne ku nze ne ye.
I didn’t know if he should hang up or what	Nali simanyi oba alina okuggyako essimu oba kiki
But we will have to act quickly.	Naye tujja kuba tulina okukola amangu.
I think he is a good man	Ndowooza musajja mulungi
If only he had the strength.	Singa yalina amaanyi.
He knows he has to go.	Akimanyi nti alina okugenda.
I can’t talk to you right now	Sisobola kwogera naawe mu kiseera kino
Surely, he thought.	Mazima ddala, bwe yalowooza.
He was a great guy.	Yali ggaayi nnyo.
He is my only friend.	Ye mukwano gwange yekka.
We'll get ya!.	Tujja kufuna ya!.
I can do much better	Nsobola okukola obulungi ennyo
No one wanted to know	Tewali yali ayagala kumanya
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
It was always true.	Bulijjo kyali kituufu.
I deserved it.	Nnali nsaanidde.
I can’t say what it was.	Siyinza kwogera kiki kye kyali.
He’s going to be working.	Agenda kuba akola.
I don’t have anything to do	Sirina kye nkola
But today he had.	Naye leero yalina.
He can’t do this.	Kino tasobola kukikola.
However, he was beautiful.	Kyokka yali mulungi.
I have so much to say	Nnina bingi nnyo bye njagala okwogera
It was a really powerful moment for me.	Ddala kyali kiseera kya maanyi gyendi.
He is here with us every day.	Ali naffe wano buli lunaku.
Not as it is.	Si nga bwe kiri.
He is really good.	Ye mulungi ddala.
I’m sure he knows better too	Nkakasa nti naye amanyi bulungi
I wanted to be normal again	Nnali njagala kuddamu kubeera wa bulijjo
He didn’t know what to say or do.	Yali tamanyi kya kwogera oba kya kukola.
He wasn’t very happy.	Yali si musanyufu nnyo.
That would be very important.	Ekyo kyandibadde kikulu nnyo.
I loved that one	Oyo nnali njagala nnyo
I don’t know where to go from here.	Simanyi gye nnyinza kugenda okuva wano.
However, I can’t stay long	Kyokka sisobola kumala bbanga ddene
But he can’t have my house.	Naye tasobola kuba na nnyumba yange.
I'll be fine.	Nja kuba bulungi.
It won’t be worse than that.	Tekijja kuba kibi okusinga ekyo.
She looks pretty much herself.	Alabika bulungi nga ye kennyini.
I couldn’t be in the same room with him	Nnali sisobola kubeera mu kisenge kimu naye
Within a week.	Mu wiiki emu.
I just can’t.	Nze sisobola kyokka.
I’ll be here all night	Nja kubeera wano ekiro kyonna
She was that beautiful.	Yali mulungi bw’atyo.
Everyone looks great.	Buli muntu alabika bulungi nnyo.
I don’t know anyone who does.	Simanyi muntu yenna akola.
That is definitely his car though.	Eyo mazima ddala mmotoka ye wadde.
No one knows for sure.	Tewali amanyi bulungi.
I was strong enough to go on	Nali wa maanyi okugenda mu maaso
I love thinking about you	Njagala nnyo okulowooza ku ggwe
It’s good for me.	Kirungi gyendi.
Not very well.	Si bulungi nnyo.
He was in class alone.	Yali mu kibiina yekka.
I’m just like him.	Nze nga ye yekka.
Who knows why.	Ani amanyi lwaki.
He could do anything.	Yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
I have a lot of things	Nnina ebintu bingi
Now, he was happy.	Kati, yali musanyufu.
I'm sure you know what	Nkakasa nti omanyi ki
I am ready to work .	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola .
You and I, we are what we are.	Nze naawe, ffe kye tuli.
I was really alone at this point	Ddala nnali nzekka mu kiseera kino
It was really beautiful.	Ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
No one knows we’re going.	Tewali amanyi nti tugenda.
And that’s easier said than done.	Era ekyo kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
This was just for him.	Kino kyali kya ye yekka.
I wasn’t interested in being with someone	Nze nali sifaayo ku kubeera na muntu
We need a plan.	Twetaaga enteekateeka.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
a.	omu.
We don’t need that idea.	Tetulina kye twetaaga ku ndowooza eyo.
And both of them are me.	Era bombi nze.
I needed time to process	Nnali nneetaaga obudde okukola ku nsonga
He just didn't know what it was.	Yali tamanyi kyokka kye kyali.
I'm glad he's here	Ndi musanyufu nti ali wano
He is not a good man.	Si musajja wa bulungi.
Not that he thought it would work.	Si nti yalowooza nti kijja kukola.
I wasn’t sure there for a little while	Nali sikakasa awo okumala akaseera katono
I actually wanted to do it	Mu butuufu nnali njagala kukikola
I didn’t know who was what	Nali simanyi ani yali ki
I won’t talk to anyone	Sijja kwogera na muntu yenna
I had to do that	Ekyo nnali nnina okukikola
I had no problems	Nnali sirina buzibu bwonna
But a phone would be nice.	Naye essimu yandibadde nnungi.
I just want to be around him	Njagala kubeera kumpi naye yekka
This had to happen immediately.	Kino kyalina okubaawo amangu ddala.
He needs your car.	Yeetaaga mmotoka yo.
I can imagine that’s not easy to do	Nsobola okulowooza nti ekyo si kyangu kukola
But in what way?' 	Naye mu ngeri ki?’.
He knew it well enough.	Yali akimanyi bulungi.
He has to be with her.	Alina okuba naye.
I want to try it all over again	Njagala kuddamu kugezaako byonna
There’s not much I can do about that.	Ekyo tewali nnyo kye nsobola kukola.
And it was pretty cool.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo.
I didn’t know what it was	Nnali simanyi kye kyali
A picture may help	Ekifaananyi kiyinza okuyamba
My job .	Omulimu gwange .
I don’t really have a problem.	Mu butuufu sirina buzibu.
It’s not hard to see why.	Si kizibu kulaba lwaki.
It is very unlikely that anyone will.	Kizibu nnyo nti omuntu ajja kukikola.
I can’t wait for your wedding	Siyinza kulinda mbaga yo
Maybe he was sick.	Mpozzi nga yali mulwadde.
I hope you will too.	Nsuubira naawe ojja kukikola.
That is not the case here.	Ekyo si bwe kiri wano.
I think he'll be fine now	Ndowooza ajja kuba bulungi kati
And herein lies the problem.	Era wano we wali obuzibu.
I just hope he’s okay	Nsuubira kyokka nti ali bulungi
And it won’t do it.	Era tekijja kukikola.
You have no idea how good you are.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna ku ngeri gy’oli mulungi.
I think that was absolutely true	Ndowooza ekyo kyali kituufu ddala
And we need to talk about what we should do.	Era twetaaga okwogera ku ekyo kye tusaanidde okukola.
And we are in the moment.	Era tuli mu kiseera.
I think someone knows	Ndowooza waliwo amanyi
There is.	Waliwo.
I thought you couldn’t	Nalowooza nti tosobola
We have a plan and that’s a good thing.	Tulina enteekateeka era ekyo kintu kirungi.
There is no one in the room.	Tewali muntu yenna mu kisenge.
I’m not going to know.	Sigenda kumanya.
He is not at home.	Tali waka.
In my room.	Mu kisenge kyange.
He has always been afraid.	Bulijjo abadde atya.
I knew how he was doing	Namanya bwe yali akola
He has been very good to me.	Abadde mulungi nnyo gyendi.
He wanted the best of anyone.	Yali ayagala muntu yenna asinga.
And yes, not exactly.	Era ye, si bwe kiri ddala.
I wanted to know why	Nnali njagala okumanya lwaki
He won’t be home until three.	Tajja kubeera waka okutuusa ku ssaawa ssatu.
We can’t do it.	Tetusobola kukikola.
It’s nothing of the sort.	Si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
I like to be busy.	Njagala nnyo okubeera bbize.
As it is, it is.	Nga bwe kiri.
He said he was a good friend of mine.	Yagambye nti yali mukwano gwange mulungi.
In every direction.	Mu buli ludda.
He was a pleasure to work with.	Yali musanyufu okukola naye.
I think it will be dangerous there at this point	Ndowooza kijja kuba kya bulabe eyo mu kiseera kino
But he is not alone.	Naye si ye yekka.
I wondered if he was okay	Nali nneebuuza oba yali bulungi
No.	Nedda.
I knew he wouldn’t	Nali mmanyi nti tajja kukikola
I love this book	Njagala nnyo ekitabo kino
He must go, he must go, she said.	Ateekwa okugenda, alina okugenda, bwe yagamba.
Like, of course, it is.	Nga, ddala, bwe kiri.
He had everything he needed	Yalina byonna bye yali yeetaaga
You can’t do anything about it.	Tosobola kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
Now I can’t go home	Kati sisobola kudda waka
And it was very, very difficult.	Era kyali kizibu nnyo nnyo.
I didn’t know anything.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi.
I hoped she was home	Nali nsuubira nti yali waka
He was an ordinary man.	Yali musajja wa bulijjo.
He knew things.	Yali amanyi ebintu.
I know it’s mine	Nkimanyi nti kyange
He didn’t like the guy.	Yali tayagala ggaayi oyo.
I am a father myself.	Nze kennyini ndi taata.
And there is still time.	Era obudde bukyali.
I doubt if it matters	Nbuusabuusa oba kikulu
I didn’t want to deal with any of that	Nnali saagala kukola ku kintu kyonna ku ebyo
Everyone knows that.	Ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
But here it is very difficult.	Naye wano kizibu nnyo.
I am nothing and everything	Nze siri kintu era buli kimu
Soon you will be with him.	Mu bbanga ttono ojja kuba naye.
I hope that continues	Nsuubira nti ekyo kigenda mu maaso
However, this is not the case here.	Kyokka, wano si bwe kiri.
Not even that.	Si wadde ekyo.
I don’t have one.	Nze sirina emu.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
This is a powerful time.	Kino kiseera kya maanyi.
He obviously knew it.	Kya lwatu yali akimanyi.
He doesn’t have a problem.	Talina buzibu.
He didn't want to talk about this.	Kino yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eno.
No, you don’t really have to do everything yourself.	Nedda, tolina ddala kukola buli kimu wekka.
I don’t even know what it was.	Simanyi na kiki kye kyali.
He seemed like a nice guy.	Yalabika nga ggaayi omulungi.
I had nothing to go on	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso
I want you too.	Njagala naawe nange.
No one knows how long.	Tewali amanyi bbanga ki.
I have been thinking about myself	Mbadde ndowooza ku nze kennyini
You don’t have to come here.	Tolina kujja wano.
I wonder where that might be	Nze nneebuuza ekyo we kiyinza okuba
Maybe he knew it.	Mpozzi yali akimanyi.
I like it a little bit, I like it a lot.	Njagala katono, njagala nnyo.
This can be within one to three hours.	Kino kiyinza okuba mu ssaawa emu okutuuka ku ssatu.
He has no friends.	Talina mikwano.
Good luck tomorrow.	Omukisa omulungi enkya.
I don’t want to see anything.	Saagala kulaba kintu kyonna.
I think the reason .	Ndowooza nti ensonga .
I love having him here	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye wano
But there was no talking.	Naye nga tewali kwogera.
But everyone knows it.	Naye buli omu akimanyi.
I couldn’t see where	Nnali sisobola kulaba wa
Not like that, of course.	Si bw’atyo, ddala.
That doesn’t matter to me.	Ekyo si kikulu gyendi.
Perhaps he didn’t have it in him to want it.	Oboolyawo yali talina mu ye kye yali ayagala.
I had to eat	Nze nnali nnina okulya
I knew that, and so did he	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi era naye bw’atyo bwe yali akimanyi
And that’s just me.	Era ekyo nze nzekka.
That’s what we have to do now.	Ekyo kye tulina okukola kati.
You could say that about me too.	Naawe oyinza okwogera ekyo ku nze.
I wanted this behind me	Kino nnali njagala emabega wange
I can do it	Nnyinza okukikola
Whether or not he will be, no one knows.	Oba ajja kuba oba nedda, tewali amanyi.
I love reading about it.	Njagala nnyo okusoma ku nsonga eyo.
I can’t do this right now	Kino sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino
No one had to spend hours at the police station.	Tewali muntu yenna yalina kumala ssaawa nnyingi ku poliisi.
He needed a reason to happen.	Yali yeetaaga ensonga okubaawo.
And in, and in.	Era mu, ne mu.
I knew he wouldn’t	Namanya nti tajja kukikola
I wanted to spend time with him	Nnali njagala okumala naye obudde
I just want to know why	Njagala kumala kumanya lwaki
What is that?' 	Ekyo kiki?’.
he asked suddenly.	bwe yabuuza mu bwangu.
I didn’t know how to deal with this	Kino nali simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukola ku nsonga eno
He seems friendly.	Alabika wa mukwano.
I don’t think that’s likely	Sirowooza nti ekyo kiyinza okubaawo
Of course, he thinks.	Kya lwatu, alowooza.
I think we all should	Ndowooza ffenna tusaanidde
That was my plan too.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka yange nange.
He and I.	Ye nange.
I have no idea about that	Ekyo sirina kye mmanyi
It had to be him.	Kyalina okuba nga ye.
I’m not him.	Nze si ye.
That is certainly not the case.	Mazima ddala ekyo si bwe kiri.
You can go.	Oyinza okugenda.
Which he couldn’t.	Kye yali tasobola.
We were both very lucky	Ffembi twali ba mukisa nnyo
I think that's why he came here	Ndowooza y'ensonga lwaki yajja wano
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
I was afraid to be alone	Nnali ntya okubeera nzekka
He loves it really.	Ayagala nnyo ddala.
I think this will be good for you	Ndowooza kino kijja kuba kirungi gy’oli
In fact, this is not always the case.	Mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri bulijjo.
He is the only guy.	Ye ggaayi yekka.
I need to think about all he said	Nneetaaga okulowooza ku byonna bye yayogera
This, of course, is not the case.	Kino, kya lwatu, si bwe kiri.
I'll stay here.	Nja kusigala wano.
And he wanted to know why.	Era yali ayagala okumanya ensonga lwaki.
And it had it.	Era kyalina.
I know what’s going to happen	Nze mmanyi ekigenda okubaawo
I’m sorry, but you have to go.	Nsonyiwa naye olina okugenda.
I can’t go on.	Sisobola kugenda mu maaso.
And there is no luck factor about it.	Era tewali nsonga ya mukisa ku nsonga eyo.
He didn’t even want to see anyone.	Yali tayagala na kulaba muntu yenna.
He is very, very happy.	Musanyufu nnyo nnyo.
He didn’t know anyone there.	Yali talina muntu yenna amanyi eyo.
I know you would like that.	Nkimanyi ekyo wandyagadde.
But it’s not mine.	Naye si kyange.
No one really knows who.	Tewali amanyi ddala ani.
And it was that movie.	Era ye yali firimu eyo.
Until tonight.	Okutuusa ekiro kino.
Everyone talked about it.	Buli omu yayogera ku nsonga eyo.
As always, no answers.	Nga bulijjo, tewali kuddamu.
But this is a good thing in many ways.	Naye kino kintu kirungi mu ngeri nnyingi.
I don’t know who it is.	Simanyi ani.
I think this might work	Ndowooza kino kiyinza okukola
I think this might help	Ndowooza kino kiyinza okuyamba
Not today, not always.	Si leero, si bulijjo.
No one was particularly interested.	Tewali yali ayagala nnyo.
No one was coming, it seemed.	Tewali yali ajja, nga kirabika.
No one thinks anything of it.	Tewali alowooza kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
It’s not what we need.	Si kye twetaaga.
You don’t even know where it is.	Tomanyi na gye kiri.
I can’t do anything	Sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
I certainly can’t.	Mazima ddala sisobola.
He’s not quite alone.	Si yekka nnyo.
I need to go make a call	Nze nneetaaga okugenda okukuba essimu
Everyone except himself.	Buli muntu okuggyako ye kennyini.
I had no desire to go anywhere	Nnali sirina kye njagala kugenda yonna
Someone has to say what it is	Omuntu alina okwogera kye kiri
I have to go tonight	Nnina okugenda ekiro kino
No you don’t have anything.	Nedda tolina kintu kyonna.
He was very good to me.	Yali mulungi nnyo gyendi.
I have to do this myself	Kino nnina okukikola nzekka
He was a young child.	Yali mwana muto.
No, of course.	Nedda, ddala.
He wants to be there.	Ayagala kubeerawo.
I thought that would be me	Nalowooza nti oyo yandibadde nze
I won’t know.	Sijja kumanya.
Or so he thought at the time.	Oba bw’atyo bwe yali alowooza mu kiseera ekyo.
Not too long ago now.	Si bbanga ddene nnyo kati.
Not for any of us.	Si lwa muntu yenna ku ffe.
And that’s not good.	Era ekyo si kirungi.
He's just a kid, really.	Ye mwana muto yekka, ddala.
Or it may be the case.	Oba kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
I should probably do the same	Oboolyawo nange nsaanidde okukola kye kimu
I hoped he was with you	Nali nsuubira nti yali naawe
When he was a child.	Bwe yali akyali mwana muto.
He had dinner.	Yalina ekyeggulo.
But he was very young.	Naye nga muto nnyo.
I knew everything was going to be hard, really, really hard.	Namanya nti buli kimu kyali kigenda kuba kizibu, ddala, ddala kizibu.
Now, you’re in.	Kati, oli mu.
I couldn’t go home	Nnali siyinza kudda waka
He was doing everything.	Yali akola buli kimu.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
I want to think about the issues myself.	Njagala okulowooza ku nsonga nzekka.
I love working with you too	Nze nange njagala nnyo okukola naawe
And you’re going to win.	Era ogenda kuwangula.
But, he agreed.	Naye, yakkiriza.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
But not immediately.	Naye si mangu ddala.
But it’s not easy.	Naye si kyangu.
He had everything.	Yalina buli kimu.
I know that for a reason	Ekyo nkimanyi lwa nsonga
For only a short time.	Okumala akaseera katono ddala.
Nothing important though.	Tewali kikulu wadde.
She is a woman.	Ye mukyala.
You are a filmmaker.	Oli muyimbi wa firimu.
I need to do that again.	Nze nneetaaga okuddamu okukola ekyo.
That was good for them.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gye bali.
I'll be back soon	Nja kudda mu bbanga ttono
I know, that’s great	Nkimanyi, ekyo kirungi nnyo
However, I am fine.	Kyokka ndi bulungi.
I loved reading this book	Nnali njagala nnyo okusoma ekitabo kino
I have no choice	Sirina kye nnyinza kukola
Or on me.	Oba ku nze.
It can always happen if.	Bulijjo kiyinza okubaawo singa...
He is a good person.	Ye muntu mulungi.
He wants to be happy.	Ayagala kubeera musanyufu.
No one worked harder than we did.	Tewali yakola nnyo okusinga ffe.
It is not the case now.	Si bwe kiri kati.
No one knew that.	Ekyo tewali yali akimanyi.
He seems harmless.	Alabika nga talina bulabe.
This is not an issue.	Eno si nsonga.
I still can’t do it and neither can you	Nze n’okutuusa kati sisobola kukikola era naawe naawe tosobola
I can do it.	Nsobola okukikola.
I have to see my friend	Nnina okulaba mukwano gwange
I feel so much better now.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo kati.
He was going to go.	Yali agenda kugenda.
I almost couldn’t see	Kumpi nnali sisobola kulaba
I don’t know what’s going on here.	Simanyi kigenda mu maaso wano.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
It’s a really bad idea.	Ddala kirowoozo kibi.
He's there.	Ali awo.
We have so much to do here.	Tulina okukola bingi nnyo wano.
This was a very important step.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
And in a way, he had.	Era mu ngeri emu, yalina.
You have to drive.	Olina okuvuga.
He knows best.	Asinga okumanya.
I can’t wait to do it again	Siyinza kulinda kuddamu kukikola
But that is very difficult.	Naye ekyo kizibu nnyo.
He can do that himself.	Ekyo asobola okukikola ye kennyini.
I couldn’t really	Nnali sisobola ddala
However, I don’t think he will.	Kyokka sirowooza nti ajja kukikola.
I won’t be back until tomorrow	Sijja kudda okutuusa enkya
As in man.	Nga bwe kiri mu muntu.
I am not that person	Nze omuntu oyo siri nze
Everything was happening so fast.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
He had a friend there with him.	Yalina mukwano gwe eyo naye.
He knows even about this everybody.	Amanyi wadde ku nsonga eno buli muntu.
I couldn’t wait to talk to you	Nnali siyinza kulinda kwogera naawe
I have the time.	Nnina obudde.
He could barely speak.	Yali asobola bulungi okwogera.
He is here with his wife.	Ali wano ne mukyala we.
It would be nice to do it again.	Kyandibadde kirungi okuddamu okukikola.
We have another one.	Tulina omulala.
He hasn’t said that yet.	Ekyo tannaba kwogera.
Someone else did it.	Omuntu omulala yakikola.
He didn’t really need one.	Mu butuufu yali teyeetaaga emu.
I was sick all the time	Nnali mulwadde buli kiseera
I hope he will do it.	Nsuubira nti ajja kukikola.
Good job though.	Omulimu mulungi wadde.
I don't care which way.	Sifaayo ngeri ki.
I wish he had known	Njagala nnyo singa yali akimanyi
Either tonight or tomorrow.	Oba ekiro kya leero oba enkya.
In fact, he has been.	Mu butuufu, abadde.
No one expects us to stay very long.	Tewali asuubira nti tujja kumala bbanga ddene nnyo.
I'll talk to you tomorrow night	Nja kwogera naawe enkya ekiro
He knew exactly who he wanted.	Yali amanyi bulungi ani gwe yali ayagala.
Not bad, not good, not anything.	Si kibi, si kirungi, si kintu kyonna.
It was just beautiful.	Kyali kirungi kyokka.
I need to do it myself	Nze nneetaaga okukikola nzekka
I think that was very important	Ndowooza ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo
I always feel normal.	Bulijjo mpulira nga ndi wa bulijjo.
His friend, doing what he had to do	Mukwano gwe, ng’akola kye yalina okukola
You know one.	Ggwe omanyi omu.
I think this is not your case	Ndowooza eno si nsonga yo
I wonder if he is in trouble	Nze nneebuuza oba ali mu buzibu
It was time to really move on.	Kyali kiseera kya kugenda mu maaso ddala.
And he is doing it.	Era ali kukikola.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera.
I wondered what he was saying	Nneebuuza kye yali ayogera
I don’t think it is.	Sirowooza nti si bwe kiri.
I think it was an hour	Ndowooza yali ssaawa
I couldn’t tell who it was	Nnali sisobola kumanya ani
I guess it doesn’t matter	Ntebereza nti si kikulu
I didn’t want anything	Nnali saagala kintu kyonna
He needed it.	Yali yeetaaga.
There is no answer here.	Wano tewali kuddamu.
I wonder what he expected	Nneebuuza kye yali asuubira
Today is work on house day.	Leero mulimu ku lunaku lwa nnyumba.
The police are here.	Poliisi eri wano.
It was very difficult for me.	Kyali kizibu nnyo gyendi.
Maybe there’s nowhere to go .	Mpozzi nga tewali wa kugenda .
A little earlier.	Katono emabegako.
But this is really good.	Naye kino ddala kirungi.
It’s what he loves.	Kye ky’ayagala ennyo.
Now he moved on.	Kati yagenda mu maaso.
Another one.	Omulala.
Now forward now that you should.	Kati mu maaso kati nti ggwe wandibadde.
I’m not sure where to go from here.	Sikakasa wa gye nnyinza kugenda okuva wano.
I should talk to you	Nze nsaanidde okwogera naawe
He had trouble speaking.	Yafuna obuzibu mu kwogera.
I wonder how long we have to stay here	Nze nneebuuza nti tulina okumala ebbanga ki wano
That is very common.	Ekyo kya bulijjo nnyo.
He thought he was doing well.	Yalowooza nti yali akola bulungi.
And with him.	Era naye.
I didn’t know why until now	Nnali simanyi lwaki okutuusa kati
Now he is ready.	Kati mwetegefu.
I have to be home for dinner	Nnina okubeera awaka okulya ekyeggulo
Not back here.	Si kudda wano.
It was a good thing to do.	Kyali kintu kirungi okukola.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
No one goes down there.	Tewali muntu yenna agenda wansi eyo.
I knew he was telling the truth	Namanya nti yali ayogera mazima
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
I know you know where it is	Nkimanyi nti omanyi gye kiri
I won’t, not at all	Sijja, si n’akatono
I thought you’d like to know	Nalowooza nti wandyagadde okumanya
I’m willing to work, do whatever you want.	Ndi mwetegefu okukola, okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
I wanted something about him.	Nnali njagala ekintu ku ye.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
I have been working on this problem for a long time	Ekizibu kino mbadde nkola okumala ebbanga
This was all a bad idea.	Kino kyonna kyali kirowoozo kibi.
He was harmless.	Yali talina bulabe.
I won’t be like my father	Sijja kuba nga taata
I think more than anyone in the house	Ndowooza okusinga omuntu yenna mu nnyumba
I am not a medical doctor	Siri musawo musawo
He is very happy with himself.	Musanyufu nnyo eri ye kennyini.
Or as.	Oba nga.
I can be anything you want me to be	Nsobola okuba kyonna ky’oyagala
With this you can go home.	Nga olina kino osobola okudda eka.
Certainly not this.	Mazima ddala si kino.
I should have done something sooner, anything	Nnali nsaanidde okukola ekintu amangu, ekintu kyonna
I don’t want to go over this with you.	Saagala kugenda ku nsonga eno naawe.
It was real.	Kyali kya ddala.
I’ll come back to you	Nja kudda gy’oli
I don’t even really have one.	Nze sirina wadde ddala.
Nothing, probably.	Tewali kintu kyonna, oboolyawo.
I live here alone now	Nze mbeera wano nzekka kati
I'm going to.	Nze njagala.
I'm now.	Nze kati.
I need to know what’s going on	Nnina okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
I know everything	Nze buli kimu nkimanyi
I didn’t feel anything.	Nnali sirina kye mpulira.
That, of course, is true.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kituufu.
He may still be asleep.	Ayinza okuba nga akyali yeebase.
Everyone comes here.	Buli muntu ajja wano.
I knew this was true	Namanya nti kino kyali kituufu
As soon as he didn’t know.	Amangu ddala nga tamanyi.
I think that’s true.	Ndowooza ekyo kituufu.
Always was and always will be.	Bulijjo kyali era bulijjo kijja kuba.
I really wanted that.	Ekyo nnali njagala nnyo.
He felt very happy.	Yawulira nga musanyufu nnyo.
I thought you had it.	Nalowooza nti ggwe olina.
He knows he shouldn’t come here.	Akimanyi nti talina kujja wano.
I do the same thing.	Nze nange nkola kye kimu.
I love to eat food.	Njagala nnyo okulya emmere.
I know better than that.	Nze mmanyi okusinga ekyo.
You will know that you know.	Ojja kumanya nti omanyi.
He was much stronger than he looked.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo okusinga bwe yali alabika.
I wanted in prison	Nnali njagala mu kkomera
I won’t say anything about us	Sijja kwogera kintu kyonna ku ffe
It’s not that issue.	Si nsonga eyo.
I go to his office right now.	Ngenda mu ofiisi ye mu kiseera kino.
I should have seen what he would do	Nnali nsaanidde okulaba kye yandikoze
In practice it is not.	Mu nkola si bwe kiri.
He came up with nothing.	Yajja nga talina kintu kyonna.
That's not the point right now.	Eyo si y'ensonga mu kiseera kino.
I didn’t have a very good answer	Nnali sirina kya kuddamu kirungi nnyo
But it was a great time.	Naye kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo.
I need to know what you told the police	Nnina okumanya bye wagamba poliisi
Not even him.	Si wadde ye.
I know he's good at it	Nze mmanyi nti mulungi mu nsonga eyo
I hope you are well.	Nsuubira nti oli bulungi.
No, he didn’t want to.	Nedda, yali tayagala.
Hours, he will do it.	Ssaawa, ajja kukikola.
I was very happy	Nali musanyufu nnyo
Maybe it isn’t.	Mpozzi nga si bwe kiri.
He agreed to be here in the shower.	Yakkiriza okubeera wano mu ssaawa.
But it was as simple as that	Naye kyali kyangu nga ekyo
I don’t want to go!	Nze saagala kugenda!
That’s all that’s happening.	Ekyo kyokka kye kigenda mu maaso.
Not lucky in this case.	Si mukisa mu mbeera eno.
It’s probably going to happen.	Oboolyawo kigenda kubaawo.
The thing is that.	Ekintu kiri nti.
Of course, that is not true.	Kya lwatu, ekyo si kituufu.
I can be someone else	Nsobola okuba omuntu omulala
Both were truthful.	Bombi baali ba mazima.
I guess we were.	Ntebereza nti twali.
I thought maybe he had	Nalowooza nti osanga yalina
Happy.	Musanyufu.
Everything is in the same place.	Buli kintu kiri mu kifo kye kimu.
I want to know the same thing	Njagala okumanya ekintu kye kimu
But at any point he would.	Naye mu kiseera kyonna yandikoze.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
I loved it and loved it	Nnali njagala nnyo era nga njagala nnyo
He is not here right now.	Tali wano mu kiseera kino.
I was working, well	Nali nkola, bulungi
I have to make a phone call.	Nnina okukuba essimu.
I didn’t want him to	Nnali saagala akole
At that point I was desperate	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali nfunye essuubi
He doesn’t like it very much.	Tayagala nnyo.
He didn’t really want to know about it all.	Yali tayagala nnyo kumanya ku byonna.
Still bad, but not quite as bad.	Akyali kibi, naye si kibi nnyo nga bwe kiri.
I was a bit like you	Nze nali nga ggwe katono
I thought he was already in the house	Nalowooza nti yali amaze mu nnyumba
But now is the day.	Naye kati lwe lunaku.
This is easily the best.	Kino kyangu okusinga obulungi.
Maybe he's happy here.	Mpozzi wano musanyufu.
I want to be with you and in you	Njagala okubeera naawe era mu ggwe
Nobody says anything about that	Ekyo tewali ayogera kintu kyonna
I am lucky.	Ndi wa mukisa.
I’m sure you can do it	Nkakasa nti osobola okukikola
I needed to know what he was doing	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya kye yali akola
I’m not even sure if I’m feeling it	Sikakasa na oba nga mpulira
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I have to get everything just right	Nnina okufuna buli kimu nga kituufu
I love making movies.	Njagala nnyo okukola firimu.
At the same time,.	Mu kiseera kye kimu,...
I am now with my husband.	Nze kati ndi ne musajja wange.
I know you have something to say	Nkimanyi nti olina ky’oyagala okwogera
I can’t see much.	Sisobola kulaba bingi.
I have been in that position.	Mbadde mu kifo ekyo.
You really are something.	Ddala oli kintu.
This is definitely not the case.	Kino ddala si bwe kiri.
That was a blessing.	Ekyo kyali kya mukisa.
I have to work as usual	Nnina okukola nga bulijjo
It’s actually true.	Mu butuufu kituufu.
He was a kid, all right.	Yali mwana muto, bulungi.
I like to go for a ride	Njagala nnyo okugenda okuvuga
He couldn’t talk to her.	Yali tasobola kwogera naye.
I can’t, anyway.	Sisobola, mu ngeri yonna.
I like to make things	Njagala nnyo okukola ebintu
But of course, he’s not here.	Naye ddala, tali wano.
I am the one he said	Nze gwe yagamba
He was a nice guy.	Yali ggaayi mulungi.
We can win.	Tusobola okuwangula.
That's why we don't.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tetulina.
I didn’t know what to say	Nali simanyi kya kwogera
I want to talk to him	Njagala kwogera naye
He is ready.	Ali mwetegefu.
That was my point.	Ekyo kye kyali ensonga yange.
That’s what we needed.	Ekyo kye twali twetaaga.
I wish she was here now	Njagala yandibadde wano kati
He was the hope.	Ye yali essuubi.
In fact, no one did.	Mu butuufu tewali yakikola.
And you’re not alone.	Era si ggwe wekka.
I can’t do it without you	Siyinza kukikola nga tolina
I am not very strong	Siri wa maanyi nnyo
I hope he has finished speaking.	Nsuubira nti amaze okwogera.
He spoke quickly.	Yayogera mangu.
And it’s a good job.	Era mulimu mulungi.
I was just his friend	Nze nali mukwano gwe yekka
No one can do whatever you want.	Tewali osobola kukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
You are not sick.	Toli mulwadde.
I always have to be planning ahead	Bulijjo nnina okuba nga nteekateeka nga bukyali
My father knows this.	Kino taata akimanyi.
Which is as bad as it can be.	Ekintu kibi nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
I probably won’t be able to stay for long	Oboolyawo sijja kusobola kumala bbanga ddene
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
I won’t be there again from tomorrow.	Sijja kuddamu kubeerawo okuva enkya.
In fact, it was going pretty fast.	Mu butuufu, kyali kigenda mangu nnyo.
She knew it, too.	Naye yali akimanyi, naye.
He was what he is now.	Yali ky’ali kati.
I was one of the talking, anyway	Nze nali omu ku kwogera, mu ngeri yonna
He was thinking.	Yali alowooza.
It comes early, and it will stay.	Kijja nga bukyali, era kijja kusigala.
That wasn’t exactly what was going to happen.	Ekyo si kye kyali kigenda okubaawo ddala.
I don’t have time during the week	Sirina budde mu wiiki
I want to know that you will come back	Njagala kumanya nti ojja kudda
Or something.	Oba ekintu.
I was a doctor like him.	Nali musawo nga ye.
I wonder what is going on with him	Nze nneebuuza ekigenda mu maaso naye
And it’s probably true.	Era oboolyawo kituufu.
But to do so, we must.	Naye okukikola, tulina.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
You can’t make someone have an opinion.	Tosobola kukola muntu kuba na ndowooza.
I wonder what he said	Nneebuuza kye yayogera
He went quickly.	Yagenda mangu.
I think it’s very important	Ndowooza kikulu nnyo
I certainly wasn’t doing anything wrong	Mazima ddala nnali sirina kibi kye nkola
It’s just good.	Kirungi kyokka.
I really belonged.	Nze ddala nnali wange.
How far can you get?.	Oyinza okutuuka wa?.
Maybe he could.	Mpozzi yali asobola.
I will talk to him about it.	Nja kwogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
I wonder if we can eat these	Nze nneebuuza oba bino tusobola okulya
There is no urgency.	Tewali bwangu bwonna.
However, this is obviously not the case.	Kyokka, kirabika kino si bwe kiri.
This is a dangerous practice.	Eno nkola ya bulabe.
This is difficult, but not uncommon.	Kino kizibu, naye si kya bulijjo.
This is probably not what you want.	Kino osanga si ky’oyagala.
I have been very sick.	Mbadde mulwadde nnyo.
He does that a lot tonight.	Ekyo akikola nnyo ekiro kino.
I know he did it.	Nkimanyi nti yakikola.
I don’t have time for that	Ekyo sirina budde
I'll do it soon.	Nja kukikola mangu.
He is the only one.	Ye yekka.
I guess we'll see what happens tomorrow	Ntebereza tujja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo enkya
You can do it.	Oyinza okukikola.
Let him do anything but work.	Akole kyonna okuggyako okukola.
I have to live with myself	Nnina okubeera nange kennyini
And everyone knew it.	Era buli omu yali akimanyi.
I think that’s all we can do here tonight	Ndowooza ekyo kyokka kye tusobola okukola wano ekiro kino
Just like everyone else.	Nga buli muntu omulala.
He had access to everyone, and everything.	Yalina okutuuka ku buli muntu, ne buli kimu.
You have a chance.	Olina omukisa.
Maybe, maybe, maybe .	Oboolyawo, oboolyawo, oboolyawo .
I was ready in that position	Nali mwetegefu mu kifo ekyo
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
And he did this.	Era kino yakikola.
He just wasn’t ready.	Yali si mwetegefu kyokka.
But it looks really good.	Naye kirabika ddala kirungi.
Just a regular guy.	Ggaayi wa bulijjo yekka.
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t	Sisobola, sisobola, sisobola
I have no idea why he is here	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki ali wano
Anyone but me.	Omuntu yenna okuggyako nze.
He was my doctor.	Yali musawo wange.
I know nothing about this	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eno
I couldn’t believe this was happening	Kino nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti kyali kigenda mu maaso
He couldn’t say that.	Yali tasobola kwogera bw’atyo.
There is no reason to deal with it.	Tewali nsonga lwaki okola ku nsonga eyo.
I wonder if he would still be in his room	Nneebuuza oba yandibadde akyali mu kisenge kye
I know this won’t be a problem.	Nkimanyi kino tekijja kuba kizibu.
He may have known it.	Ayinza okuba nga yali akimanyi.
Or if he was, what was it.	Oba bwe yali, kyali ki.
But it will always be of the same thing	Naye bulijjo kijja kuba kya kintu kye kimu
I really hoped it wasn’t true	Ddala nnali nsuubira nti si kituufu
This is neither here nor there.	Kino si wano wadde wali.
There is no plan.	Tewali nteekateeka yonna.
This is, of course, absolutely true.	Kino, kya lwatu, kituufu ddala.
I should probably get to school	Oboolyawo nsaanidde okutuuka ku ssomero
I still didn’t know what to do	N’okutuusa kati nnali simanyi kya kukola
I'm sorry, he said.	Nsonyiwa, bwe yagamba.
I don’t really know.	Mu butuufu simanyi.
However, in reality.	Kyokka, mu butuufu.
That's the whole thing.	Ekyo kye kintu kyonna.
I can do this myself now	Kino nsobola okukikola nzekka kati
You in love with yourself a little.	Ggwe mu mukwano naawe katono.
With a dog.	Nga waliwo embwa.
I have to be.	Nnina okubeera.
I love that you can shop	Njagala nnyo nti osobola okugula
That’s pretty cool, actually.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
I want to see this place	Njagala kulaba kifo kino
I could just live in here	Nnali nsobola okubeera mu wano kyokka
It is indeed very soon.	Mazima ddala mangu nnyo.
We will do everything.	Tujja kukola buli kimu.
I think you should talk to him .	Ndowooza olina okwogera naye .
And he will be with us.	Era ajja kuba naffe.
He is the strongest.	Ye asinga amaanyi.
And he can’t do it in my car.	Era tasobola kukikola mu mmotoka yange.
But it was a very, very close thing.	Naye kyali kintu kya kumpi nnyo nnyo.
From the hospital.	Okuva mu ddwaaliro.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He is a young child.	Ye mwana muto.
I want to stay the same	Njagala kusigala nga bwe kiri
I know why he had to go	Nkimanyi lwaki yalina okugenda
You will be able to go home.	Ojja kusobola okudda eka.
You can’t tell what it is.	Tosobola kumanya bwe kiri.
Nobody wants that!.	Ekyo tewali ayagala!.
I think it’s up to you	Ndowooza kiri gyoli
Apparently he is the only one.	Kirabika ye yekka.
I could do it myself	Nze kennyini nnali nsobola okukikola
No one had any idea what or how.	Tewali yalina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki oba ngeri ki.
He won’t do that.	Ekyo tajja kukikola.
Eating is very difficult.	Okulya kizibu nnyo.
I love that person	Njagala nnyo oyo omuntu
I have plenty of time.	Nnina obudde bungi.
He was obviously the one talking.	Kya lwatu nti ye yali ayogera.
He is really afraid.	Ddala atya.
He is very sick.	Mulwadde nnyo.
He has to do it.	Alina okukikola.
I was thinking the same thing	Nze nali ndowooza kye kimu
That was love.	Ekyo kyali kwagala.
He is not a doctor.	Si musawo musawo.
No, there is no way.	Nedda, tewali ngeri yonna.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I know this.	Kino nkimanyi.
He had the money.	Yalina ssente.
I’m here to stay.	Nze ndi wano.
I feel a lot about this	Mpulira nnyo ku nsonga eno
It’s very important, he said.	Kikulu nnyo, bwe yagambye.
I will be in your office in the morning	Nja kubeera mu ofiisi yo ku makya
But no one knew much.	Naye tewali yali amanyi bingi.
There is only one.	Waliwo omu yekka.
I am just one person	Ndi muntu omu yekka
That he didn’t want to.	Nti yali tayagala.
I hope he’s going to be okay	Nsuubira nti agenda kuba bulungi
This is very, very powerful.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo nnyo.
I don’t want to do this	Kino saagala kukikola
That seems to be the room.	Ekyo kirabika nga kye kisenge.
A very nice person.	Omuntu omulungi ennyo.
He knew his friend well.	Yali amanyi bulungi mukwano gwe.
No, my friend.	Nedda mukwano gwange.
He was certainly ready.	Mazima ddala yali mwetegefu.
I didn’t know why at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi lwaki
Just a book.	Ekitabo kyokka.
That’s not true here.	Ekyo si kituufu wano.
Most everyone is good.	Okusinga buli muntu mulungi.
I knew how important it was	Nnali nkimanyi nti kikulu nnyo
You are the one.	Ggwe oli omu.
He didn’t know where we were.	Yali tamanyi gye twali.
This to me is very important.	Kino gyendi kikulu nnyo.
He knew everything.	Yali amanyi buli kimu.
Power to do anything you want.	Amaanyi okukola ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala.
I really have nothing to do	Mazima ddala sirina kye nkola
I wanted to be him.	Nnali njagala kubeera ye.
Not at the moment.	Si mu kiseera kino.
This all feels good now	Kino kyonna mpulira bulungi kati
He felt exactly like that.	Yawulira bw’atyo ddala.
But now he is sick.	Naye kati mulwadde.
Although not in the office.	Wadde nga si mu ofiisi.
I love to win	Njagala nnyo okuwangula
I know that better than anyone	Ekyo nkimanyi okusinga omuntu yenna
He said it didn't matter.	Yagambye nti si kikulu.
He is good at his job.	Mulungi mu mulimu gwe.
You have to read these.	Bino olina okusoma.
Not even my phone.	Si wadde essimu yange.
I’m all over the place right now	Nze ndi mu kifo kyonna mu kiseera kino
He doesn't think clearly.	Talowooza bulungi.
I knew he wouldn’t.	Namanya nti tajja kukikola.
But there was that thing.	Naye nga waliwo ekintu ekyo.
I know you have one.	Nkimanyi nti olina emu.
It was.	Kyali.
And a beautiful one.	Era omulungi.
He is really well and wants to play.	Ali bulungi ddala era ayagala kuzannya.
I think he’s pretty good.	Ndowooza nti mulungi nnyo.
He was the only help he got.	Ye buyambi yekka bwe yafuna.
I’m here all the time.	Nze ndi wano buli kiseera.
There is nothing to buy.	Tewali kya kugula.
Back in the same room.	Okudda mu kisenge kye kimu.
I didn’t want to see anything	Nnali saagala kulaba kintu kyonna
The police will want to talk to you.	Poliisi ejja kwagala okwogera naawe.
She was my wife.	Yali mukyala wange.
I was anybody	Nali muntu yenna
No one did it.	Tewali yakikola.
But it wasn’t, of course.	Naye si bwe kyali, ddala.
But now, there is just nothing there.	Naye kati, tewali kintu kyonna kyokka awo.
I can’t say much more than that right now	Siyinza kwogera bingi okusinga ekyo mu kiseera kino
I want to but not here	Njagala naye si wano
I don’t really like it as well but someone else might.	Sikyagala nnyo nga bwe kiri naye omuntu omulala ayinza.
He must have made money.	Ateekwa okuba nga yakola ssente.
. . . .	.
I didn’t know why at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi lwaki
I couldn’t find much about it	Nnali sisobola kufuna bingi ku nsonga eyo
But that’s not really the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri ddala.
I don’t know what’s going on before.	Simanyi kigenda mu maaso emabegako.
But he didn’t want to stay there.	Naye yali tayagala kusigala awo.
I thought everyone knew that.	Nalowooza nti buli omu yali akimanyi ekyo.
I think it’s a good plan.	Ndowooza nti nteekateeka nnungi.
Exactly how much is hard to say.	Ddala mmeka kizibu okwogera.
It doesn’t seem to be coming.	Kirabika tekijja.
I don’t know anything about his friends right now	Sirina kye mmanyi ku mikwano gye mu kiseera kino
But this is it.	Naye kino.
And where was he now.	Era kati yali ludda wa.
I wanted to eat alone today	Nnali njagala kulya nzekka leero
The dog is good.	Embwa nnungi.
He had his luck.	Yalina omukisa gwe.
This is a dangerous job.	Omulimu guno gwa bulabe.
I want to be a true child to you	Njagala kubeera mwana wa mazima gyoli
I just wanted to see what would happen	Nnali njagala kulaba kyokka ekigenda okubaawo
As he was when .	Nga bwe yali nga .
She is my best friend’s wife.	Ye mukyala wa mukwano gwange asinga.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
I wanted to talk about it.	Nnali njagala okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
I know absolutely nothing about him	Sirina kye mmanyi n’akatono ku ye
I think he has a point	Ndowooza alina ensonga
I thought that was pretty cool	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo
I will do that immediately.	Ekyo nja kukikola amangu ddala.
This may be too low.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kya wansi nnyo.
He certainly made the call.	Mazima ddala yakola essimu.
It would be easier, of course.	Kyandibadde kyangu, ddala.
Everything seems like just one thing.	Buli kintu kirabika nga ekintu kimu kyokka.
And more than that of course.	Era okusinga ekyo ddala.
Not too soon.	Si mangu nnyo.
Or one week.	Oba wiiki emu.
I am an ordinary person	Ndi muntu wa bulijjo
Obviously it wasn’t.	Kya lwatu si bwe kyali.
But not in any way.	Naye si mu ngeri yonna.
You have to be at work in an hour.	Olina okuba ku mulimu mu ssaawa emu.
I will have to do that.	Ekyo nja kuba nnina okukikola.
Or he lives here.	Oba abeera wano.
I'll be down	Nja kuba wansi
I certainly won’t	Mazima ddala sijja kukikola
While working.	Nga akola.
He has been.	Abadde...
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
And he will do it.	Era ajja kukikola.
I can’t go back to prison	Sisobola kudda mu kkomera
I don’t want to be alone	Saagala kubeera nzekka
This is hard to watch, even now.	Kino kizibu okulaba, ne kati.
I don’t think any of us can.	Sirowooza nti waliwo ku ffe asobola.
I hear something behind me	Nze mpulira ekintu emabega wange
I had no idea what he might be doing	Nnali simanyi kye yandiba ng’akola
I'm not even sure if I can get anything.	Sikakasa wadde oba waliwo kye nnyinza okufuna.
I love that stuff.	Njagala nnyo ebintu ebyo.
And he was beautiful.	Era yali mulungi.
I can’t live with anyone	Siyinza kubeera na muntu yenna
I guess we’ll see what happens.	Ntebereza tujja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
But not here.	Naye si wano.
I really didn’t know what to expect	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kye nsuubira
It’s not serious.	Si kya maanyi.
Felt comfortable here too.	Yawulira bulungi wano naye.
On the car.	Ku mmotoka.
I don’t care.	Sifaayo.
I want to make friends	Njagala kufuna mikwano
We don’t have time for this.	Kino tetulina budde.
Not very easy of course.	Si kyangu nnyo ddala.
You can’t do it alone.	Tosobola kukikola wekka.
It was a difficult time for us.	Kyali kiseera kizibu gye tuli.
It is not my place to say which.	Si kifo kyange okwogera ki.
And that’s the thing.	Era ekyo kye kintu.
I don't know where.	Nze simanyi wa.
And we’re going to do it too.	Era naffe tugenda kukikola.
I think that’s all we can do	Ndowooza ekyo kyokka kye tusobola okukola
Really, really easy.	Ddala, ddala kyangu.
I think he's real, kid	Ndowooza ye wa ddala, mwana
But another will come.	Naye omulala ajja kujja.
This is certainly the case.	Mazima ddala kino bwe kiri.
You’re going to find him happy.	Ggwe ogenda osanga nga musanyufu.
That’s what it actually is.	Ekyo kye kiri mu butuufu.
I love to talk	Njagala nnyo okwogera
I was now sure of that.	Ekyo kati nnali nkakasa.
I think it’s great.	Ndowooza nti kirungi nnyo.
But that is not the case here.	Naye wano si bwe kiri.
I am not very good by any means.	Siri mulungi nnyo mu ngeri yonna.
See.	Okulaba.
Only one child	Mwana omu yekka
Everyone is in town.	Buli muntu ali mu kibuga.
We don’t have to be together.	Tetulina kubeera wamu.
It seems like no one wants to deal with this problem, but someone has.	Kirabika tewali ayagala kukola ku kizibu kino, naye waliwo alina.
And in this work.	Era mu mulimu guno.
He was a very good friend of mine.	Yali mukwano gwange mulungi nnyo.
From my job.	Okuva ku mulimu gwange.
You’re so young.	Oli muto nnyo.
I was in a hurry.	Nali mu bwangu.
I have one myself.	Nze kennyini nnina emu.
I want to know what I can do.	Njagala okumanya bye nsobola okukola.
He told me, of course.	Yang’amba, ddala.
And now is the time to do it.	Era kati kye kiseera okukikola.
I could leave this place	Nnali nsobola okuva mu kifo kino
I knew he was strong.	Namanya nti yali wa maanyi.
I thought he was just a strong father	Nalowooza nti yali taata wa maanyi yekka
I’m sick of being here.	Nze ndi mulwadde okubeera wano.
I will definitely do this again.	Kino nja kuddamu okukola ddala.
We can’t have someone like that.	Tetusobola kuba na muntu nga oyo.
I said, of course.	Nagamba, ddala.
And he was very young.	Era nga muto nnyo.
I don’t really know why this would be.	Simanyi bulungi lwaki kino kyandibadde.
I wanted to get away from everything and everyone	Nnali njagala okuva ku buli kimu ne buli muntu
I want to know everything, too	Nze njagala okumanya buli kimu, nange
Now we are not alone.	Kati si ffe ffekka.
That’s what we’re going to do here.	Ekyo kye tugenda okukola wano.
We can do it again.	Tusobola okuddamu okukikola.
I didn’t think it mattered	Nnali sirowooza nti kyali kikulu
It can be helpful.	Kiyinza okuyamba.
And you alone.	Naawe wekka.
To him it was very simple.	Eri ye kyali kyangu nnyo.
I hope he is okay.	Nsuubira nti ali bulungi.
Maybe you could do the same for the city.	Mpozzi naawe oyinza okukola ekintu kye kimu ku kibuga.
It was his money.	Yali ssente ze.
Three nights this week, three nights last week.	Ekiro ssatu wiiki eno, ekiro ssatu wiiki ewedde.
I thought that preaching.	Nalowooza nti okubuulira.
I think he didn’t want to go	Ndowooza yali tayagala kugenda
But of course you can.	Naye ddala oyinza.
I couldn’t be happier	Nnali siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo
I have to think hard	Nnina okulowooza ennyo
I knew you would do it again	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kuddamu okukikola
You can’t win.	Tosobola kuwangula.
I wanted to quit my job	Nnali njagala okuva ku mulimu gwange
I wanted to go as soon as we could	Nnali njagala okugenda amangu ddala nga bwe tusobola
You have a phone.	Olina essimu.
Or at work.	Oba ku mulimu.
He must be in my opinion.	Ateekwa okuba nga mu ndowooza yange.
Yesterday I had no school	Eggulo nali sirina ssomero
I won’t be able to see anything	Sijja kusobola kulaba kintu kyonna
I needed to move on	Nnali nneetaaga okugenda mu maaso
But he is here.	Naye ali wano.
Here is a very good one.	Wano waliwo omulungi ennyo.
I couldn’t believe it, and neither could he	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza, era naye yali tasobola
This is what was really going on.	Kino kye kyali kigenda mu maaso ddala.
I couldn’t do it yet though	Nze n’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kukikola wadde
I just needed one night	Nnali nneetaaga ekiro kimu kyokka
He shouldn’t be here.	Tasaanidde kubeera wano.
I loved my brother	Muganda wange nnali njagala nnyo
I love this picture	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi kino
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
I love his personality	Njagala nnyo omuntu we
I know you wanted to talk	Nkimanyi nti wali oyagala kwogera
I don’t want that.	Ekyo saagala.
He went on with everyone.	Yagenda mu maaso ne buli muntu.
That’s the point.	Eyo y’ensonga.
He seems to love it.	Alabika ayagala nnyo.
I wanted to see what went down	Nnali njagala okulaba ekigenda wansi
A moment ago he had been so happy	Akaseera katono emabega yali abadde musanyufu nnyo
But this job is mine.	Naye omulimu guno gwange.
But it looked good.	Naye nga kirabika bulungi.
I needed to think fast	Nnali nneetaaga okulowooza amangu
That was very realistic.	Ekyo kyali kya ddala nnyo.
This was about him.	Kino kyali ku ye.
It was definitely intense.	Mazima ddala kyali kya maanyi.
He thought quickly.	Yalowooza mangu.
I might call now.	Nnyinza okukuba essimu kati.
That person is going.	Omuntu oyo agenda.
It was fine at the time.	Kyali kirungi mu kiseera ekyo.
Maybe I will do that too.	Mpozzi nange ekyo nja kukikola.
I want to know what the plan is	Njagala kumanya nteekateeka ki
Difficult to important.	Ekizibu okutuuka ku kikulu.
It’s not realistic.	Si kya ddala.
I am not alone in this.	Kino siri nze nzekka.
Am I the one? 	Nze nze?
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
I need to talk to you	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe
I have to spend some time here	Nnina okumala akaseera wano
No one knows what they are.	Tewali amanyi kye bali.
No one needed to know about it.	Tewali yali yeetaaga kumanya ku nsonga eyo.
I hope we’ll be okay here	Nsuubira nti wano tujja kuba bulungi
Very nice phone.	Essimu nnungi nnyo.
I just wanted to be happy	Nnali njagala kubeera musanyufu kyokka
I was very happy	Nali musanyufu nnyo
I’m not with the police.	Nze siri na poliisi.
I can’t go to the police but you can	Sisobola kugenda ku poliisi naye ggwe osobola
I hope to go, soon.	Nsuubira okugenda, mu bwangu.
And no one is around.	Era tewali muntu yenna ali kumpi.
I will always do it.	Bulijjo nja kukikola.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I know he is telling the truth	Nkimanyi nti ayogera mazima
I can’t believe we’re the only ones	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ffe ffekka
I want to be the best as always.	Njagala kubeera asinga nga bulijjo.
Like really today.	Nga ddala leero.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
I really didn’t know what to do	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kukola
And you knew he would.	Era wali okimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
I thought we’d have time	Nalowooza nti tujja kufuna obudde
I won’t say all of it really.	Sijja kwogera byonna ddala.
In excellent condition.	Mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
If only you could come back in an hour, or maybe tomorrow.	Singa oyinza okudda mu ssaawa emu, oba mpozzi enkya.
He loved being with us	Yali ayagala nnyo okubeera naffe
He almost can’t do it.	Kumpi tasobola kukikola.
That was my plan.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka yange.
He was in trouble.	Yali mu buzibu.
That's what.	Ekyo kye ki...
The movie would be good	Firimu yandibadde nnungi
That would be something.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu.
Not as it is.	Si nga bwe kiri.
And it was the weekend.	Era yali wiikendi.
I feel good, actually	Mpulira bulungi, mu butuufu
But that was probably a good thing.	Naye oboolyawo ekyo kyali kintu kirungi.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
I don’t think it will be an issue.	Sirowooza nti kijja kuba nsonga.
I needed to be ready.	Nnali nneetaaga okuba nga mwetegefu.
I just want to be me	Njagala kubeera nze kyokka
I knew my father wouldn’t say anything	Nali nkimanyi nti taata tajja kwogera kintu kyonna
It doesn’t matter now.	Si kikulu kati.
I was nervous and felt overwhelmed	Nnali ntya era nga mpulira nga nfunye obuzibu
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
I think it was basically the same at the time	Ndowooza okusinga kyali kye kimu mu kiseera ekyo
He wanted to	Yali ayagala .
I was at her wedding.	Nali ku mbaga ye.
He would be here now.	Yandibadde wano kati.
You have everything.	Olina buli kimu.
I almost couldn’t believe it	Kumpi nnali siyinza kukkiriza
I just wanted to be with you	Nnali njagala kubeera naawe kyokka
I love reading this one	Njagala nnyo okusoma eno
I need to be alone	Nze nneetaaga kubeera nzekka
I didn’t want to know.	Nnali saagala kumanya.
You don’t have much.	Ggwe tewali nnyo.
All those things.	Ebintu ebyo byonna.
Good job brother, good job.	Omulimu omulungi muganda wange, omulimu mulungi.
Even then it would be difficult.	Ne mu kiseera ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
Then they both are.	Awo bombi bwe bali.
He had been a child.	Yali abadde mwana muto.
I feel very happy.	Mpulira nga ndi musanyufu nnyo.
Not until now.	Si okutuusa kati.
Study of a person .	Okusoma ku muntu .
Obviously, this is a good thing.	Kya lwatu nti kino kintu kirungi.
I can get that.	Ekyo nsobola okufuna.
Something he saw.	Ekintu kye yalaba.
We are in a good position.	Tuli mu mbeera nnungi.
I didn’t want to either	Nange nnali saagala
That’s how he felt.	Bw’atyo bwe yawulira.
Although that’s not exactly the case.	Wadde ng’ekyo si bwe kiri ddala.
I didn’t know what we were going to do	Nnali simanyi kye twali tugenda kukola
I thought it wouldn’t work	Nalowooza nti tekijja kukola
He won’t want to.	Tajja kwagala.
Going back to work will help with that.	Okudda ku mulimu kijja kuyamba ku ekyo.
I needed so much more.	Nnali nneetaaga bingi nnyo.
I wonder how it looks.	Nze nneebuuza engeri gye kirabika.
This is the reason why.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki.
I just think that’s very romantic	Nze ndowooza kyokka nti ekyo kya mukwano nnyo
I love stuff like that	Njagala nnyo ebintu nga ebyo
There is only.	Waliwo kyokka.
I really had nothing to say	Mu butuufu nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera
I want to be us.	Njagala kubeera ffe.
I want tonight in my room	Njagala ekiro kino mu kisenge kyange
I love really well.	Njagala nnyo ddala bulungi.
I feel a lot about this	Mpulira nnyo ku nsonga eno
I just wanted to talk to you	Nnali njagala kwogera naawe wekka
I think he loved my father.	Ndowooza yali ayagala nnyo taata.
I won’t be here long	Sijja kubeera wano bbanga ddene
He would be at home.	Yandibadde awaka.
I love his work	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwe
How he went about it.	Engeri gye yagenda mu maaso ku nsonga eyo.
I am everywhere at the same time	Ndi buli wamu mu kiseera kye kimu
However, I am not sure.	Kyokka, sikakasa.
Of course, he said.	Kya lwatu, bwe yagamba.
I was so nervous I couldn’t eat	Nnali ntya nnyo nga sisobola kulya
He was the one who wanted it.	Ye yali ayagala.
I knew he had me.	Nali nkimanyi nti alina nze.
I think he might be real though	Ndowooza ayinza okuba nga wa ddala wadde
There is nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna.
He had to get help.	Yalina okufuna obuyambi.
And he is very young.	Era muto nnyo.
We’re going to win.	Tugenda kuwangula.
We were very lowly.	Twali ba wansi nnyo.
It's all him.	Byonna ye.
He was moving forward.	Yali agenda mu maaso.
He loves it more though.	Asinga kwagala wadde.
I have something to do	Nnina kye nkola
I think that might work.	Ndowooza ekyo kiyinza okukola.
And he can’t either.	Era naye tasobola.
I just have it.	Nze nnina kyokka.
He was making money.	Yali akola ssente.
I was all over the place	Nali mu kifo kyonna
Like in the movie.	Nga mu firimu.
He does the exact same thing.	Akola ekintu kye kimu ddala.
Winning isn’t the point.	Okuwangula si y’ensonga.
That was the problem here.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu wano.
It could be anyone.	Yandiba nga waliwo omuntu yenna.
That's why we're here.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
That's what we need.	Kye twetaaga.
I guess we’re friends, in a way	Ntebereza nti tuli ba mukwano, mu ngeri emu
I know you can do the same	Nkimanyi nti naawe osobola okukola kye kimu
There is no truth in him.	Tewali mazima mu ye.
I am very beautiful.	Ndi mulungi nnyo.
I can never have that happen again	Ekyo siyinza kuddamu kubaawo
This was the weekend.	Eno ye yali wiikendi.
That won’t happen.	Ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
Certainly not today.	Mazima ddala si leero.
I was hoping, but I knew nothing	Nali nsuubira naye nga sirina kye mmanyi
He was in something.	Yali mu kintu.
There is talking in the background.	Waliwo okwogera emabega.
I still can’t believe it, really.	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kukkiriza, ddala.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
That’s a possibility.	Ekyo kiyinza okubaawo.
He would still be in the hospital.	Yandibadde akyali mu ddwaaliro.
Someone from the place	Omuntu okuva mu kifo
This is nowhere near bad.	Kino tewali we kiri kumpi kibi.
I didn’t think you would	Nnali sirowooza nti ojja kukikola
I wanted to stay together	Nnali njagala kusigala ffembi
He was my friend.	Yali mukwano gwange.
Something we have to do.	Ekintu kye tulina okukola.
There are many options here.	Wano waliwo ebintu bingi bye tusobola okukola.
That was what he was thinking.	Ekyo kye yali alowooza.
I need to do these things myself	Ebintu bino nneetaaga kukola nzekka
Not for something like this.	Si lwa kintu nga kino.
I doubt this is true.	Nbuusabuusa nti kino kituufu.
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo
I won’t have to do any more trouble	Sijja kuddamu kukola buzibu bwonna
I have no idea why or how or anything.	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki oba ngeri ki oba ekintu kyonna.
You can imagine.	Osobola okulowooza.
I just want to go home.	Njagala kudda waka kyokka.
He was almost behind her.	Yali kumpi emabega we.
But that was fine.	Naye ekyo kyali kirungi.
It’s easy but it’s not.	Kyangu naye nga si bwe kiri.
And it still is.	Era n’okutuusa kati bwe kiri.
Perhaps it is.	Oboolyawo bwe kiri.
Going to be a problem.	Okugenda okuba ekizibu.
We’re going to get away from that.	Tugenda okuva ku ekyo.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
I think he plans to talk to you	Ndowooza ateekateeka kwogera naawe
But that seems normal to you now.	Naye ekyo kirabika kya bulijjo gy’oli kati.
I just didn’t know what to do about it	Nze nnali simanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo
Only one of them.	Omu yekka.
I love having him on.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye ku...
He is ordinary.	Ye wa bulijjo.
I wonder who it could be	Nze nneebuuza ani ayinza okuba
I know a lot of things, you know	Nze mmanyi ebintu bingi, omanyi
I think it’s time.	Ndowooza kye kiseera.
He's where you are now.	Ye gy'oli kati.
I have no idea what it was.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki kye kyali.
I wanted to help my father	Nnali njagala okuyamba taata
Maybe this will help.	Mpozzi kino kijja kuyamba.
Tomorrow will be better.	Enkya ejja kuba nnungi.
I was in love with it	Nali njagala nnyo
I need to talk to him	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye
I didn’t know where it was	Nnali simanyi gye kyali
It is very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo.
I am sure you will do well.	Nkakasa nti ojja kukola bulungi.
He had hope, of course.	Yalina essuubi, ddala.
He had to think.	Yalina okulowooza.
I'll be back next week	Nja kudda wiiki ejja
We will talk for a very long time.	Tujja kwogera okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
I think that would be good.	Ndowooza ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
What a beautiful child.	Nga mwana mulungi nnyo.
I have the whole thing	Nnina ekintu kyonna
We’ll have to do that in the car.	Ekyo tujja kuba tulina okukikola mu mmotoka.
I really didn’t want to go home	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kudda waka
Maybe it was.	Mpozzi bwe kyali.
You’re not the only one, you know.	Si ggwe wekka, omanyi.
I’m so scared.	Nze ntya nnyo.
I’m not sure he knows	Sikakasa nti amanyi
I didn’t know that would happen	Ekyo nnali simanyi nti kijja kubaawo
In excellent condition.	Mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Mpozzi enkya ekiro.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
I, and I alone.	Nze, nange nzekka.
I think we have a good chance	Ndowooza tulina omukisa omulungi
Maybe it wasn’t.	Mpozzi nga si bwe kyali.
And my, what a week to watch, too.	Era wange, nga wiiki ki okulaba, nange.
I’m sorry, it was my idea	Nsonyiwa, kyali kirowoozo kyange
I am very curious	Njagala nnyo okumanya
There and there.	Eyo ne eyo.
I wasn’t going to do that	Ekyo nnali sigenda kukikola
I think that will be enough	Ndowooza ekyo kijja kumala
Let me think about it.	Ka ndowooza.
I think that’s what’s important	Ndowooza ekyo kye kikulu
I want to be comfortable.	Njagala kubeera bulungi.
Now to make the food.	Kati okukola emmere.
And this isn’t the only one.	Era kino si kyokka.
We are strong.	Tuli ba maanyi.
You know one.	Ggwe omanyi omu.
You can’t do it.	Tosobola kukikola.
No one is in sight.	Tewali muntu yenna alabika.
But he was there.	Naye yali awo.
I hope that doesn’t continue.	Nsuubira nti ekyo tekijja kugenda mu maaso.
But he knew one thing.	Naye yali amanyi ekintu kimu.
I still can’t talk to him.	Nze n’okutuusa kati sisobola kwogera naye.
I think everyone is ready to go home.	Ndowooza buli omu mwetegefu okudda eka.
I wanted to get back to the place I loved	Nnali njagala kudda mu kifo kye nnali njagala
I wasn’t sure myself.	Nze kennyini nnali sikakasa.
I work for a long time.	Nkola ebbanga ddene.
I think it will work for a long time	Ndowooza kijja kukola okumala ebbanga ddene
Not me, of course.	Si nze, ddala.
I couldn’t see anything.	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
He was with her still.	Yali naye nga akyali.
But you are not.	Naye ggwe si bwe kiri.
I really didn’t know why	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi lwaki
I'll be here.	Nja kuba wano.
He wants to know if it was real.	Ayagala okumanya oba kyali kya ddala.
There is only one problem.	Waliwo ekizibu kimu kyokka.
He says it’s going to be good but he knows it.	Agamba nti kigenda kuba kirungi naye akimanyi.
I will not live with this.	Sijja kubeera na kino.
I guess it was an issue.	Ntebereza nti yali nsonga.
And so much of this.	Era bingi nnyo ku kino.
You have to be there.	Olina okubeera awo.
I need to get help	Nze nneetaaga okufuna obuyambi
He needed to tell someone.	Yali yeetaaga okubuulira omuntu.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
I'll do it.	Nja kukola.
I was just a guy that, everybody	Nali ggaayi yekka nti, buli muntu
It’s nothing to me.	Si kintu kyonna gyendi.
He could have been like.	Yali asobola okuba nga.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I can’t let that happen	Ekyo siyinza kukkiriza kubaawo
There is a presence.	Waliwo okubaawo.
I knew something was up with him	Namanya nti waliwo ekigenda mu maaso naye
And that’s pretty cool.	Era ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I am happy, but not with everything	Ndi musanyufu, naye si na buli kimu
I can’t do it right now	Sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino
I don’t want to be that person	Nze saagala kubeera muntu oyo
I think he knew better	Ndowooza yali asinga okumanya
He is what he is.	Ye ky’ali.
With luck, we’ll be there tonight.	Nga tulina omukisa, tujja kubeerawo ekiro kino.
However, I knew it was going to happen.	Kyokka nnali nkimanyi nti kigenda kubaawo.
I was being human	Nze nali kubeera muntu
It seemed so real.	Kyali kirabika nga kya ddala nnyo.
I have, this is a way	Nnina, eno ngeri
He was a very nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo.
I think everyone talks about me behind my back	Ndowooza buli omu ayogera ku nze emabega wange
That's a practice.	Eyo nkola.
One should try to see.	Omuntu yandibadde agezaako okulaba.
I don’t want to go back down there	Saagala kudda wansi awo
And you don’t have to either.	Era naawe tolina kukikola.
I just wanted to be with him.	Nnali njagala kubeera naye kyokka.
This is not realistic.	Kino si kya ddala.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
That’s the place, and it’s timely.	Ekyo kye kifo, era kiri mu budde.
He is a young man now.	Ye musajja muto kati.
He just couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola kyokka.
I really didn’t know what to say	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kwogera
He says that it is.	Agamba nti bwe kiri.
I don’t know what to expect.	Nze simanyi kye nsuubira.
I was the youngest	Nze nnali muto
You fear for yourself.	Otya ku ggwe kennyini.
And that's there there.	Era oyo eyo eyo.
He already knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi dda.
I’ve always been here.	Nze bulijjo mbadde wano.
I thought this would work	Nalowooza nti kino kijja kukola
And there isn’t.	Era tewali.
I only knew one thing	Ekintu kimu kyokka kye nnali mmanyi
You are a beautiful child.	Oli mwana mulungi.
Maybe you were a lot like me.	Mpozzi wali nga nze nnyo.
I can’t do that here	Ekyo sisobola kukikola wano
But it’s not him.	Naye si ye.
I have a dog.	Nnina embwa.
But it looks awful now.	Naye kirabika kibi nnyo kati.
One must do .	Omuntu alina okukola .
Not myself.	Si nze kennyini.
I couldn’t be happier	Siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo
You don’t want someone like that.	Toyagala muntu nga oyo.
It won’t be much.	Tekijja kuba bingi.
I’m sure we can do it.	Nkakasa nti tusobola okukikola.
And there’s a lot.	Era waliwo bingi.
I don’t know who he was at the time.	Simanyi ani mu kiseera ekyo.
I have a cat in my room	Nnina embwa mu kisenge kyange
I don’t think it was my idea	Sirowooza nti kyali kirowoozo kyange
I need to think fast	Nze nneetaaga okulowooza amangu
We were safe there.	Twali tetulina bulabe eyo.
We’ll just do it, together, and everything will be fine.	Tujja kumala kukikola, nga tuli wamu, era buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi.
And he knew she knew it.	Era yali akimanyi nti yali akimanyi.
I might say that again	Ekyo nnyinza okuddamu okwogera
He does many things well.	Ebintu bingi akola bulungi.
I love everyone here	Njagala nnyo buli muntu wano
It may not work.	Kiyinza obutakola.
How happy he was.	Nga yali musanyufu nnyo.
I wanted to know if you would come with me	Nnali njagala okumanya oba ojja kujja nange
I wasn’t sure about him	Nali sikakasa ku ye
It’s not the same place.	Si kifo kye kimu.
I’m sure you’re on to it.	Nkakasa nti oli ku nsonga eyo.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
I suppose of course.	Nze nsuubira nti ddala.
Yeah, yeah.	Ye, ye.
Not all of it, by any means.	Si byonna, mu ngeri yonna.
You have to be here.	Olina okuba nga oli wano.
I can’t do this.	Kino sisobola kukikola.
This is a fact.	Eno nsonga.
The attitude is not good.	Endowooza si nnungi.
I know it now.	Nze nkimanyi kati.
I can’t talk about him	Sisobola kwogera ku ye
And he couldn’t speak.	Era yali tasobola kwogera.
I guess that is my problem	Ntebereza nti ekyo kye kizibu kyange
Three.	Ssatu.
He was a poet and musician	Yali muyimbi era muyimbi
But that’s not a good reason.	Naye ekyo si nsonga nnungi.
I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not.	Sikakasa oba kino kintu kirungi oba nedda.
Back to the bottom.	Okudda wansi.
And that was a really good thing, actually.	Era ekyo kyali kintu kirungi ddala, mu butuufu.
Not in this way.	Si mu ngeri eno.
You think it’s real.	Olowooza nti kya ddala.
That is not the truth.	Ekyo si kye kituufu.
He looks strong.	Alabika nga wa maanyi.
I knew it would come.	Namanya nti kijja kujja.
But to see things clearly.	Naye okulaba ebintu obulungi.
We’re going home.	Tugenda waka.
I’ve always wanted to	Bulijjo mbadde njagala
I don’t know anything about you.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ggwe.
It’s easy to find another job as well.	Kyangu okufuna omulimu omulala nga naawe olina.
I need to know if it’s true	Nnina okumanya oba kituufu
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
It will happen.	Kijja kubaawo.
He had to think fast.	Yalina okulowooza amangu.
I need to talk to him about work	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye ku mulimu
I love doing that.	Ekyo njagala nnyo okukikola.
And it looks great.	Era kirabika bulungi nnyo.
I really have to be going	Ddala nnina okuba nga ngenda
That’s hard to answer.	Ekyo kizibu okuddamu.
He's doing really well.	Akola bulungi ddala.
I guess you actually might	Ntebereza nti mu butuufu oyinza
There is a difficult problem here.	Wano waliwo ekizibu ekizibu.
And my brother.	Ne muganda wange.
This is a complex problem.	Kino kizibu kya buzibu nnyo.
Not very much at all.	Si nnyo nnyo.
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
It is very close.	Kiri kumpi nnyo.
I know this isn’t always the case	Nkimanyi nti kino si bwe kiri bulijjo
I do better without it	Nkola bulungi nga sirina
I’m sure you can.	Nkakasa nti osobola.
I've been thinking	Mbadde ndowooza
That one too.	Oyo naye.
I am well aware of that	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi
It was truly beautiful.	Mazima ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
I need to get out of there	Nze nneetaaga okuva awo
I was totally ready to move on.	Nali mwetegefu ddala okugenda mu maaso.
Just like in a relationship.	Nga bwe kiri mu mukwano.
Both, he thought.	Bombi, bwe yalowooza.
I was hoping you would like it	Nali nsuubira nti wandyagadde
You can’t tell.	Tosobola kumanya.
I wanted to know about his situation	Nnali njagala okumanya ku mbeera ye
But probably not.	Naye oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
I have to do this.	Kino nnina okukikola.
Soon we will be best friends.	Mu bbanga ttono tujja kuba ba mukwano nnyo.
He had to be good.	Yalina okuba omulungi.
But something is going on.	Naye waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
I think about it myself	Nze kennyini ndowooza ku nsonga eyo
I wanted nothing about this place	Nnali njagala kintu kyonna ku kifo kino
Maybe we were.	Mpozzi nga twali.
I’m really feeling down	Nze ddala mpulira wansi
It was very, very dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo, kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
I knew everything I needed to know	Nnali mmanyi buli kye nnali nneetaaga okumanya
He alone doesn’t come.	Ye yekka tajja.
He got what he wanted	Yafuna kye yali ayagala
I didn’t know what was going on	Nnali simanyi kigenda mu maaso
I don’t want to be with him.	Sikyagala kubeera naye.
Not only that, but it is.	Si kyokka, naye kye kiri.
That’s what it was.	Kye kyali.
You can do it too.	Naawe osobola okukikola.
I will mostly agree	Nze okusinga nja kukkiriza
I needed to know the facts.	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya ensonga.
He was on her side.	Yali ku ludda lwe.
Dad could see what it was, he thought.	Taata yali asobola okulaba kye yali, bwe yalowooza.
This was actually pretty cool in my opinion.	Kino mu butuufu kyali kirungi nnyo mu ndowooza yange.
It will be very helpful.	Kijja kuyamba nnyo.
We can’t wait.	Tetusobola kulinda.
Actually, quite well.	Mu butuufu, bulungi nnyo.
I have a job to do	Nnina omulimu gwe nkola
I wasn’t going to let that happen	Ekyo nnali sigenda kukkiriza kubaawo
We have to think about planning.	Tulina okulowooza ku nteekateeka.
But, we move on, onward to .	Naye, tugenda mu maaso, mu maaso okutuuka ku .
I'm not so sure he did.	Sikakasa nnyo nti yakikola.
No one in town could know they were here.	Tewali muntu yenna mu kibuga yali asobola kumanya nti bali wano.
Apparently this is real.	Kirabika kino kya ddala.
Something like this.	Ekintu nga kino.
But he has to do it.	Naye alina okukikola.
And frankly, he had no plans of his own.	Era mu butuufu, yali talina nteekateeka ye yonna.
Every place and everybody.	Buli kifo na buli muntu.
That’s good to know.	Ekyo kirungi okumanya.
This is not a city.	Kino si kibuga.
I was the beautiful one.	Nze nnali mulungi.
'nothing'.	'tewali'.
He is he and I am me.	Ye ye era nze nze.
I was very close to him.	Nali kumpi nnyo naye.
And there was nothing we could say.	Era nga tewali kye twali tusobola kwogera.
I know you are not yourself	Nkimanyi nti toli ggwe kennyini
One thing, though.	Kyokka, ekintu kimu.
I just need a little time	Nze nneetaaga akaseera katono
That’s how it was in love.	Bw’atyo bwe kyali mu mukwano.
We are always hopeful.	Bulijjo tulina essuubi.
I wondered who could come back from this	Nali nneebuuza ani ayinza okudda okuva mu kino
I'm sure it would work.	Nkakasa nti yandikoze.
I can get the job done faster	Nsobola okukola omulimu mu bwangu
I didn’t know where, how, he lived.	Nali simanyi wa, ngeri ki, gye yali abeera.
And, he was actually a really nice guy.	Era, mu butuufu yali ggaayi mulungi ddala.
I knew he would	Nali mmanyi nti ajja kukikola
However, that will obviously not happen.	Kyokka, kya lwatu nti ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
It can go many ways.	Kiyinza okugenda mu ngeri nnyingi.
It's all him.	Byonna ye.
He readily agreed.	Yakkiriza mangu.
I'm sure this will get the job done now.	Nkakasa nti kino kijja kukola omulimu kati.
You have to talk to him.	Olina okwogera naye.
A little bit of that.	Katono ku ekyo.
Everyone knew, but no one saw.	Buli omu yali amanyi, naye nga tewali yalaba.
I feel better now, I feel much better	Mpulira bulungi kati, mpulira bulungi nnyo
He is in his room.	Ali mu kisenge kye.
I'm going to go.	Nze ngenda.
Whatever is going on here, is not what it seems.	Kyonna ekigenda mu maaso wano, si kye kirabika.
He is still a man.	Akyali musajja.
I want to know everything that is going on	Njagala okumanya buli kimu ekigenda mu maaso
I know he is near	Nkimanyi nti ali kumpi
Now, there’s something about this.	Kati, waliwo ekintu ku kino.
Not himself.	Si ye kennyini.
He wants anything.	Ayagala ekintu kyonna.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
You were always so good to me.	Bulijjo wali mulungi nnyo gyendi.
I'm not quite sure what to do	Sikakasa bulungi kya kukola
Actually, maybe not.	Mu butuufu, mpozzi si bwe kiri.
Clearly, the person does not have a personality disorder.	Kya lwatu nti omuntu oyo talina buzibu bwa muntu.
I belonged to the other guy.	Nze nali wa ggaayi omulala.
I know you love it.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala nnyo.
I wasn’t going to have any of that	Nze nali sigenda kuba na kintu kyonna ku ebyo
In fact, we can see this happening today.	Mu butuufu, kino tusobola okulaba nga kigenda mu maaso leero.
It’s everything.	Kye buli kimu.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
Today that is important, but difficult to do.	Leero ekyo kikulu, naye kizibu okukola.
I have a lot of money	Nnina ssente nnyingi nnyo
I have to get to the back	Nnina okutuuka emabega
It doesn’t matter what it is.	Si kikulu ki kye kiri.
He will do it soon.	Ajja kukikola mu bbanga ttono.
I was happy there.	Nali musanyufu eyo.
I had no idea it would be so bad	Nali sirina kirowoozo nti kyandibadde kibi nnyo
I know you’re at work	Nkimanyi nti oli ku mulimu
He doesn’t want to talk to you.	Tayagala kwogera naawe.
Either.	Oba.
I don’t think it will happen	Sirowooza nti kijja kubaawo
You and I, now.	Nze naawe, kati.
I'm completely sorry.	Nsonyiwa ddala.
Obviously, this is complicated and expensive.	Kya lwatu nti kino kizibu era kya ssente nnyingi.
I think maybe it could happen	Ndowooza mpozzi kiyinza okubaawo
Harmless, he was harmless.	Nga talina bulabe, yali talina bulabe.
I have no feelings about it	Sirina mpulira yonna ku nsonga eyo
I’m not sure of anything	Nze sirina kye nkakasa
And that’s me.	Era oyo nze.
I didn’t quite know what to say	Nnali simanyi bulungi kya kwogera
I'm not sure about the process though	Sikakasa ku nkola wadde
Anyone who wants to.	Omuntu yenna ayagala.
Down, down, down.	Wansi, wansi, wansi.
Looks like someone actually lives here now.	Kirabika waliwo omuntu abeera wano mu butuufu kati.
For a while no one said anything.	Okumala akaseera tewali yayogera kintu kyonna.
He obviously didn't know what he was doing.	Kya lwatu nti yali tamanyi kye yali akola.
I am with my brother.	Nze ndi ne muganda wange.
Someone like you and me	Omuntu nga nze naawe
In any case.	Mu ngeri yonna.
I really didn’t want to though	Mu butuufu nnali saagala wadde
It’s really very difficult.	Ddala kizibu nnyo.
He needed something, anyway.	Yalina kye yali yeetaaga, mu ngeri yonna.
I really needed that	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga nnyo
He is with us.	Ali naffe.
I guess that’s a good thing	Ntebereza nti ekyo kintu kirungi
I have nowhere to be.	Sirina we ndi wa.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
He couldn’t talk to me.	Yali tasobola kwogera nange.
You can do anything.	Oyinza okukola ekintu kyonna.
He looked strong and powerful.	Yalabika nga wa maanyi era nga wa maanyi.
I didn’t know anything.	Nze nali sirina kye mmanyi.
I think this looks great	Ndowooza kino kirabika bulungi nnyo
I just know it would work	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti yandikoze
But honestly, it’s not .	Naye mu butuufu, si .
It may but that is nothing important.	Kiyinza naye ekyo si kintu kikulu.
I said she was fine, and she was	Nagamba nti yali bulungi, era yali
I know this about myself	Kino nkimanyi ku nze
Driving is not a real option for me.	Okuvuga si nkola ya ddala gyendi.
But mostly, of course, we were there.	Naye okusinga, ddala, twali awo.
What a beautiful morning it would be	Nga enkya yandibadde nnungi
I know you can do this	Nkimanyi nti kino osobola okukikola
I know that, too.	Ekyo nange nkimanyi.
I knew he was too close to call	Namanya nti yali kumpi nnyo okukuba essimu
I think he was young	Ndowooza yali muto
I feel like I really love it.	Mpulira nga ddala njagala nnyo.
I need to see my father immediately	Nze nneetaaga okulaba taata mu bwangu
He knew what was going to happen.	Yali amanyi ekigenda okubaawo.
But no one knew exactly what it was.	Naye tewali yali amanyi bulungi kiki kye kyali.
And every job we have to do.	Ne buli mulimu gwe tulina okukola.
That’s what I think.	Kye ndowooza.
He thought maybe he could be that person	Yalowooza nti osanga asobola okuba omuntu oyo
We can do this.	Kino tusobola okukikola.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
No one said anything.	Tewali yayogera kintu kyonna.
He does a very good job.	Akola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
I am well aware of that	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi
Anyone else having this problem?.	Waliwo omuntu omulala alina ekizibu kino?.
I’m in trouble here	Nze wano ndi mu buzibu
In fact, you can.	Mu butuufu, osobola.
I want to see something very soon.	Njagala okulaba ekintu mu bbanga ttono ddala.
That's why we're in trouble.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tuli mu buzibu.
I know we are alone here	Nkimanyi nti tuli ffekka wano
No, there is no problem.	Nedda, tewali buzibu.
Problems at home.	Obuzibu awaka.
No one knows where they are.	Tewali amanyi gye bali.
I think someone else	Ndowooza omuntu omulala
That was easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu.
I don’t want anyone to know	Saagala muntu yenna kumanya
I might be working tonight	Nnyinza okuba nga nkola ekiro kino
Shouldn't you have one?.	Tolina kuba nga olina emu?.
He may have been a human too.	Ayinza okuba nga naye yali muntu.
He knew he had no choice.	Yali akimanyi nti talina kya kukola.
It is normal for us to do so.	Kya bulijjo ffe okukikola.
I don’t really know.	Mu butuufu simanyi.
He's going to try one.	Agenda kugezaako emu.
We needed to do it sooner, but we are where we are.	Twali twetaaga okukikola amangu naye tuli we tuli.
This is simply not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri kyokka.
No one knows this.	Kino tewali akimanyi.
It is his job.	Gwe mulimu gwe.
I just want to do this	Njagala kukola kino kyokka
He said he wanted to talk.	Yagambye nti ayagala kwogera.
I can’t do this alone.	Kino sisobola kukikola nzekka.
It was a really beautiful place.	Ddala kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
I am with my father.	Nze ndi ne taata wange.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
I thought that was it.	Nnali ndowooza nti ekyo kye kyali.
It's his thing, you might say.	Kintu kye, oyinza okugamba.
It was going to be close.	Kyali kigenda kuba kumpi.
And he wants to.	Era ayagala.
He wanted to go with her, of course.	Yali ayagala kugenda naye, ddala.
I could just do it	Nnali nsobola okumala okukikola
It's good, it's good.	Kirungi, kirungi.
He is almost alone in the class.	Kumpi ali mu kibiina yekka.
It’s not a problem now but it will be in time.	Si kizibu kati naye kijja kuba mu budde.
That’s what this really was.	Ekyo kino ddala kye kyali.
He was, in every case, every man wanted.	Yali, mu buli mbeera, buli musajja ayagala.
I could do that	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola
I want to talk to him	Njagala kwogera naye
But there he was.	Naye awo gye yali.
He always looked like that.	Bulijjo yali alabika bw’atyo.
I was too scared to do anything	Nnali ntya nnyo nga sisobola kukola kintu kyonna
I can’t believe what he said in it	Siyinza kukkiriza bye yayogera mu yo
I thought we had it in us.	Nalowooza nti tulina mu ffe.
But he is beautiful.	Naye ye mulungi.
As in this case.	Nga bwe kiri mu mbeera eno.
! 	!
I don’t think that’s true	Sirowooza nti ekyo kituufu
But someone else	Naye omuntu omulala
I am a good player.	Ndi muzannyi mulungi.
I can’t believe it’s true	Siyinza kukkiriza nti kituufu
And it’s powerful, and it’s dangerous.	Era kya maanyi, era kya bulabe.
But he didn’t want to believe it.	Naye yali tayagala kukkiriza.
He went with me.	Yagenda nange.
Something like.	Ekintu nga.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
I know it’s good for me	Nkimanyi nti kirungi gyendi
That was the plan.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka.
I was terrified myself.	Nze kennyini nnali ntya nnyo.
Now it’s not too dangerous.	Kati tewali bulabe nnyo.
They were and they are.	Baali era bali.
Easier said than done though.	Kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola wadde.
I hope he will do it.	Nsuubira nti ajja kukikola.
I knew this was great	Namanya nti kino kyali kirungi nnyo
In fact, no one really does.	Mu butuufu, ddala tewali muntu yenna akikola.
I have no way of knowing	Sirina ngeri gye nnyinza kumanya
But this is not really true.	Naye kino mu butuufu si kituufu.
I guess you could say he was my best friend	Ntebereza oyinza okugamba nti yali mukwano gwange asinga
Not that he was much of a man, of course.	Si nti yali musajja nnyo, ddala.
It’s important to me.	Kikulu gyendi.
That’s just fine.	Ekyo kirungi kyokka.
I think he needs his time	Ndowooza yeetaaga obudde bwe
You certainly need to know.	Mazima ddala olina okumanya.
But it’s not the same for you, either.	Naye naawe si kye kimu, naawe.
I just want that for me	Nze njagala ekyo kyange kyokka
You will never see my wife again.	Togenda kuddamu kulaba mukyala wange.
It’s not what it is.	Si kye kiri.
I don’t quite know why.	Simanyi bulungi lwaki.
I need to think about that yet	Nze nneetaaga okulowooza ku ekyo n’okutuusa kati
I didn’t know about any of this	Nnali simanyi ku kintu kyonna ku bino
I was working hard to do it	Nnali nkola nnyo okukikola
From school .	Okuva ku ssomero .
I could have been home a week ago	Nnali nsobola okubeera awaka wiiki emu emabega
That’s a good thing.	Ekyo kiri bulungi.
I just want to be in the air	Njagala kubeera mu bbanga kyokka
Right now,.	Kati,.
We are lucky and blessed.	Tuli ba mukisa era tulina omukisa.
I was wondering what that thing was for	Nali nneebuuza ekintu ekyo kyali kya ki
I guess you know that	Ntebereza ekyo okimanyi
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
We have a job to do.	Tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
But you.	Naye ggwe.
I can’t wait to tell the truth	Siyinza kulinda kwogera mazima
I will have to do it	Nja kuba nnina okukikola
It’s a practical thing.	Kye kintu kya nkola.
I was alone in the room	Nali nzekka mu kisenge
He had no choice but to leave.	Yali talina kya kukola okuggyako okugenda.
He had it coming.	Yalina nga ejja.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
I would love to know where you are.	Njagala nnyo okumanya gy’oli.
I didn’t want to go to school	Nnali saagala kugenda mu ssomero
I had been with him every day	Nnali mbadde naye buli lunaku
I love this picture.	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi kino.
If it weren’t for him.	Singa si bwe yali.
I’m actually afraid to go home	Mu butuufu ntya okudda eka
I need a plan of action	Nze nneetaaga enteekateeka y’okukola
And he was very interested.	Era yali ayagala nnyo.
But not in him.	Naye si mu ye.
I can't tell who where	Sisobola kumanya ani wa
But it’s not true.	Naye si kituufu.
I didn’t know what he would do	Nnali simanyi kye yandikoze
I was absolutely terrified	Nali ntya nnyo ddala
In theory, he did it alone.	Mu ndowooza, yakikola yekka.
I think he would like that	Ndowooza ekyo yandiyagadde
This is the case in my case.	Kino bwe kiri mu mbeera yange.
This will be a dangerous time.	Kino kijja kuba kiseera kya bulabe.
He knew it, but he didn't want to.	Yali akimanyi, naye nga tayagala.
But that wasn’t it.	Naye ekyo si kye kyali.
He seems to love it.	Alabika ayagala nnyo.
I feel so much better	Mpulira bulungi nnyo
But she looks good.	Naye alabika bulungi.
I hope it was, at that	Nsuubira nti kyali, ku ekyo
Everyone has something they want.	Buli muntu alina ky’ayagala.
The thing, he said, is that we shouldn't go.	Ekintu, yagambye nti tetulina kugenda.
I don’t like it.	Sikyagala.
But that doesn’t matter	Naye ekyo si kikulu
I’m actually in a good mood.	Mu butuufu ndi mu mbeera nnungi.
He will know that one.	Ajja kumanya oyo.
I wondered the same thing	Nange ne nneebuuza ekintu kye kimu
I thought this was a great idea.	Nalowooza nti kino kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I wondered how he was really doing	Nneebuuza nti ddala yali akola atya
I am indeed very fortunate	Mazima ddala ndi wa mukisa nnyo
And it’s nothing to us that he did with us.	Era si kintu kyonna gye tuli ekyo kye yakola naffe.
He said something.	Waliwo kye yayogera.
I need to see that movie	Nze nneetaaga okulaba firimu eyo
This is actually a good thing.	Kino mu butuufu kintu kirungi.
Where he should be.	We yandibadde.
I want it here tomorrow morning	Njagala wano ku makya enkya
That’s not always true.	Ekyo si kituufu bulijjo.
I know it won’t be easy	Nkimanyi nti tekijja kuba kyangu
I can’t wait to have my car again	Siyinza kulinda kuddamu kuba na mmotoka yange
And I had no idea what here	Era nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki wano
Like me, too.	Nga nange.
He's both both.	Ye bombi bombi.
That’s fine with us!.	Ekyo kiri bulungi gye tuli!.
I don’t know why though	Simanyi lwaki wadde
We were on there together.	Twali ku awo ffenna.
I knew this was coming	Namanya nti kino kyali kijja
I'm going to do it.	Ngenda kukikola.
I know what he was trying to do	Nze kye yali agezaako nkimanyi
He told me.	Yang’amba.
Of course, that is the whole problem.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo kye kizibu kyonna.
It’s just what we need.	Kye twetaaga kyokka.
I do, of course.	Nze nkola, ddala.
I don’t think any of that was.	Sirowooza nti ekintu kyonna ku ebyo kyali.
One by one.	Omu ku omu.
I just want to get something to eat	Njagala kufuna kya kulya kyokka
It was a very strong group.	Kyali kibiina kya maanyi nnyo.
But apparently it wasn’t.	Naye kirabika si bwe kyali.
I’m on to you, he said.	Nze ndi ku ggwe, bwe yagambye.
I’m not at the house.	Nze siri ku nnyumba.
Anything was better than nothing.	Ekintu kyonna kyali kirungi okusinga obutakola kintu kyonna.
I really have to see someone	Ddala nnina okulaba omuntu
I really hope he does	Nsuubira nnyo nti akola
Now that everyone has it, maybe not so much.	Kati nga buli muntu alina, mpozzi si nnyo.
He was just a guy.	Yali ggaayi yekka.
I really want to go.	Njagala nnyo okugenda.
In theory, he could do whatever he wanted.	Mu ndowooza, yali asobola okukola kyonna kye yali ayagala.
I can’t be what he wants	Siyinza kuba ky’ayagala
I know he won’t.	Nkimanyi nti tajja kukikola.
I just hope it’s nothing bad	Nsuubira kyokka nti si kintu kibi
But, you can’t get anything out of something.	Naye, tosobola kufuna kintu kyonna mu kintu.
I think he’s facing that now	Ndowooza kati ayolekedde bw’atyo
It’s good, though.	Kirungi naye.
No one had it.	Tewali yalina.
Now you can do the same.	Kati naawe oyinza okukola kye kimu.
It’s not even about .	Si wadde ku .
I could never do such a bad thing	Siyinza kukola kintu kibi ng’ekyo
I don’t want to see anyone right now	Saagala kulaba muntu yenna mu kiseera kino
However, this is easier said than done.	Kyokka kino kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
It’s easy to see why.	Kyangu okulaba ensonga lwaki.
I don’t know much.	Simanyi bingi.
I didn’t know the answer to this	Kino nnali simanyi kya kuddamu
In my house not on the floor.	Mu nnyumba yange si wansi.
Myself and my father.	Nze kennyini ne taata.
You don’t know at all.	Tomanyi n’akatono.
I knew what to expect.	Nnali mmanyi kye nnali nsuubira.
Or he thought.	Oba yalowooza.
He is still a good man.	Akyali musajja mulungi.
I don’t really care about that	Nze sifaayo nnyo ku nsonga eyo
I guess they were too busy with me	Ntebereza nti baali bbize nnyo nange
It was as simple as that	Kyali kyangu nga ekyo
I am ready and willing	Ndi mwetegefu era mwetegefu
Everything you want.	Buli kyoyagala.
It wasn’t the case.	Si bwe kyali.
When is the issue.	Ensonga ddi...
I knew he wasn’t coming back	Nali nkimanyi nti yali tagenda kuddamu kujja
This was a good thing.	Kino kyali kintu kirungi.
But don’t come into the house.	Naye tojja mu nnyumba.
No one is on the.	Tewali muntu yenna ali ku...
Or there isn’t much.	Oba tewali nnyo.
I want to know about this happening	Njagala okumanya ku kino ekigenda mu maaso
We have plenty of time.	Tulina obudde bungi.
He wouldn’t talk to anyone.	Yali tagenda kwogera na muntu yenna.
This is exactly the case.	Kino ddala bwe kiri.
My job is not good.	Omulimu gwange si mulungi.
That’s good for them.	Ekyo kirungi gye bali.
We have to do this.	Kino tulina okukikola.
I can't see anything back here	Sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna emabega wano
I was just wondering if he was here	Nali nneebuuza kyokka oba yali wano
And no one wants that.	Era tewali ayagala ekyo.
He felt very sleepy.	Yawulira nga yeebase nnyo.
But that is not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu.
At my job.	Ku mulimu gwange.
But this is very difficult to do well.	Naye kino kizibu nnyo okukola obulungi.
He is still very good.	Akyali mulungi nnyo.
It’s hard to move on.	Kizibu okugenda mu maaso.
I know everything	Nze buli kimu nkimanyi
I feel so lucky right now	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa nnyo mu kiseera kino
You can .	Osobola .
I was very, very nervous	Nali ntya nnyo nnyo
I couldn’t believe he would do something like that	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti yandikoze ekintu ng’ekyo
You are doing very well.	Okola bulungi nnyo.
It’s not really about who’s better.	Mu butuufu si ku ani asinga.
I thought he would back off	Nalowooza nti ajja kudda emabega
I couldn’t believe it.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza.
I needed to get out of that room	Nnali nneetaaga okuva mu kisenge ekyo
I want to do it here	Njagala kukikola wano
Answer to us.	Okuddamu gye tuli.
I'm not quite sure what's going to happen.	Sikakasa bulungi kiki ekigenda okubaawo.
You’re going to do this, he said.	Kino ogenda kukikola, bwe yagambye.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
This is one of many.	Kino kye kimu ku bingi.
They were like us.	Baali nga ffe.
His dog is with him.	Embwa ye eri naye.
Easy, he thought.	Kyangu, bwe yalowooza.
I wish we could but we can’t	Njagala tusobola naye tetusobola
We can talk on weekends.	Tusobola okwogera ku wiikendi.
I thought that was good	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi
He saw that coming.	Yalaba ekyo nga kijja.
I wanted to see if you could do it.	Nnali njagala okulaba oba osobola okukikola.
I love being here	Njagala nnyo okubeera wano
That may be true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
Of course, it is easier said than done.	Kya lwatu nti kyangu okwogera okusinga okukola.
It’s nothing out of the ordinary, of course.	Si kintu kya bulijjo, ddala.
I think it’s myself	Ndowooza nti nze kennyini
I like it here though	Njagala wano wadde
He was very good at his job.	Yali mulungi nnyo mu mulimu gwe.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Kyokka, si kikulu.
I want to know.	Njagala kumanya.
He didn’t want to come with me.	Yali tayagala kujja nange.
Now there are three.	Kati waliwo ssatu.
I couldn’t go home	Nnali sisobola kudda waka
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
If only he were here.	Singa yali wano.
I feel he is doing well	Mpulira akola bulungi
I don’t have any space.	Nze sirina kifo kyonna.
I wasn’t going to be able to help anyone.	Nnali sigenda kusobola kuyamba muntu yenna.
This seems to go pretty easily.	Kino kirabika nga kigenda kyangu nnyo.
It's just there.	Kiri awo kyokka.
I knew something like this would happen	Nali mmanyi nti ekintu nga kino kijja kubaawo
I have and you can too	Nnina era naawe osobola
Maybe this is absolutely true, he thought.	Mpozzi kino kituufu ddala, bwe yalowooza.
We'll see.	Tujja kulaba.
I can’t even see the car from here	Sisobola na kulaba mmotoka okuva wano
Me, him and he and his wife.	Nze, ye ne ye ne mukyala we.
He probably had no reason to.	Oboolyawo yali talina nsonga lwaki yali akola bw’atyo.
So far, so true.	N’okutuusa kati, kituufu nnyo.
My friend is here.	Mukwano gwange ali wano.
I had always hoped we would spend this night together.	Bulijjo nnali nsuubira nti ekiro kino tujja kumala wamu.
But I wanted to go with him	Kyokka nnali njagala kugenda naye
Reading was something everyone did back then.	Okusoma kyali kintu buli omu kye yali akola mu kiseera ekyo.
I know exactly what is going on	Nze mmanyi bulungi ekigenda mu maaso
We will be there.	Tujja kubeerawo.
I have better luck than him	Nze nnina omukisa omulungi okusinga ye
I’m doing well so far.	Nkola bulungi okutuusa kati.
One thing we all have to do.	Ekintu kimu ffenna kye tulina okukola.
Now I was completely desperate	Kati nnali nfunye essuubi ddala
This is where the problem lies.	Wano obuzibu we buli.
And this is it.	Era kino.
I easily could, too	Nze kyangu nnyo nnali nsobola, nange
I just didn’t want to be in that position.	Nze nali saagala kubeera mu kifo ekyo kyokka.
I think you would really like it	Ndowooza ddala wandyagadde
I’m not doing anything	Nze sirina kye nkola
I wanted to talk to you a bit	Nnali njagala kwogera naawe katono
Not necessarily that he could see.	Si kituufu nti yali asobola okulaba.
I thought this would be a good time for it	Nalowooza nti kino kyandibadde kiseera kirungi gye kiri
You are here, and you are not here.	Oli wano, era toli wano.
Does anyone know if there is a way to do this.	Waliwo amanyi oba waliwo engeri y'okukola kino.
I had no idea this was going to happen	Kino nnali simanyi nti kino kyali kigenda kubaawo
I am so many things	Nze ebintu bingi nnyo
I think he was happy.	Ndowooza yali musanyufu.
I had no idea where I was going	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi gye nnali ngenda
And I said he was asleep	Era nagamba nti yeebase
This goes on for a while.	Kino kigenda mu maaso okumala akaseera.
I’m not sure of his reasons for doing it.	Sikakasa nsonga ze lwaki yakikola.
I’m not from here	Nze siri wa wano
My wife was at school or something.	Mukyala wange yali ku ssomero oba ekintu kyonna.
You can be yourself.	Osobola okuba ggwe kennyini.
He didn't know what he wanted to say to anyone.	Yali tamanyi kye yali ayagala kwogera eri muntu yenna.
It’s not a bad thing.	Si kintu kibi.
Unusual.	Si kya bulijjo.
But not really.	Naye si ddala.
Maybe you can too.	Mpozzi naawe osobola.
I know your point of view.	Nze mmanyi endowooza yo.
I really hope you do	Nsuubira ddala nti okola
I can’t figure out why	Sisobola kumanya lwaki
I hope you are not yourself.	Nsuubira nti toli ggwe kennyini.
I knew what this was	Kino nnali mmanyi kye kyali
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
Maybe you will win.	Mpozzi ojja kuwangula.
Good, whatever.	Kirungi, kyonna.
If I think of something I will come back.	Singa ndowooza ku kintu nja kudda.
He had been here, but not now.	Yali abadde wano, naye kati si bwe yali.
Things like that.	Ebintu nga ebyo.
He works in the.	Akola mu.
Terrible.	Kibi.
It is true and powerful.	Kituufu era kya maanyi.
This is very true though.	Kino kituufu nnyo wadde.
I can’t say how or when	Siyinza kwogera ngeri ki oba ddi
It was a powerful night for me.	Ekiro kyali kya maanyi nnyo gyendi.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
Not true, of course.	Si kituufu, ddala.
Nothing is going to happen here.	Wano tewali kigenda kubaawo.
He obviously had help.	Kya lwatu nti yalina obuyambi.
However, I need time to process this	Kyokka nneetaaga obudde okukola ku nsonga eno
It can go home now.	Kiyinza okudda eka kati.
I won’t know until tomorrow	Sijja kumanya okutuusa enkya
I really think this will help	Ndowooza ddala kino kijja kuyamba
I have something that everyone wants.	Nnina ekintu buli omu ky’ayagala.
This is just you and me together for a little while.	Kino nze naawe kyokka nga tuli wamu okumala akaseera katono.
Just saying something.	Okwogera ekintu kyokka.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
He had time for that.	Ekyo yalina obudde.
He thought that was pretty cool.	Yalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I will be near you	Nja kuba kumpi naawe
Maybe he had a problem himself here.	Mpozzi nga ye kennyini yalina ekizibu wano.
I was down, right down.	Nali wansi, wansi ddala.
Now anyone can come back.	Kati omuntu yenna asobola okudda.
Now I am the only one.	Kati nze nzekka.
I have no idea about yesterday or tomorrow	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku jjo oba enkya
I’ve been everywhere.	Mbadde buli wamu.
From him.	Okuva ku ye.
If he had, it was awful.	Singa yalina, kyali kibi nnyo.
I'm not going.	Sigenda.
He is there, here.	Ali awo, wano.
I don’t think that’s true.	Ekyo sirowooza nti kituufu.
We are all ourselves.	Ffenna tuli ba ffekka.
I didn’t know he would come here	Nnali simanyi nti ajja kujja wano
He just wanted to go home.	Yali ayagala kudda waka kyokka.
I really didn’t know	Mazima ddala nnali simanyi
But he wants a child.	Naye ayagala mwana.
I was stronger than he was.	Nze nnali wa maanyi okusinga ye.
The issue is not an issue at all	Ensonga si nsonga n’akatono
I guess he had no choice	Ntebereza nti yali talina kya kukola
I didn’t know that was coming	Nnali simanyi nti ekyo kyali kijja
I wish he thought	Njagala ye yalowooza
And just being with me.	Era okubeera nange kyokka.
But it goes back a long way.	Naye dda nnyo emabega.
I knew that for a reason	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi lwa nsonga
I was so scared	Nze nnali ntya nnyo
That was the right thing to do.	Ekyo kyali kituufu.
It's not going	Si kugenda
I can’t work in an office	Sisobola kukola mu ofiisi
It’s very hard to see.	Kizibu nnyo okulaba.
I suppose it can be very difficult	Nsuubira nti kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo
I couldn’t wait to get to know my other dad	Nali siyinza kulinda kumanya taata wange omulala
Most probably not.	Okusinga osanga si bwe kiri.
I know so many things	Nze mmanyi ebintu bingi nnyo
I just want to be here	Njagala kubeera wano kyokka
I wish I could go home	Njagala nnyo okudda eka
You know he will.	Omanyi ajja kukikola.
I was ready for them.	Nnali mwetegefu gye bali.
I could easily do that	Ekyo nnali nsobola bulungi okukikola
But one more and.	Naye omulala omu era...
I need to know right now	Nnina okumanya mu kiseera kino
However, I am a little curious	Kyokka, njagala nnyo okumanya katono
But here it is.	Naye wano.
There is a moment.	Waliwo akaseera.
We need these things.	Ebintu bino twetaaga.
That if.	Nti singa.
What we need is the police.	Kye twetaaga ye poliisi.
I wasn’t ready for that one	Oyo nnali siri mwetegefu
Everything was happening so fast.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
It seems to be the case.	Kirabika nga bwe kiri.
Because but not down.	Kuba naye si wansi.
I could be normal for a while	Nnali nsobola okuba wa bulijjo okumala akaseera
I love being with you	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo nnyo
I really couldn’t believe it.	Mazima ddala nnali sisobola kukkiriza.
And it was pretty cool.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo.
He was lovely.	Yali wa kwagala.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
I was kind of in a hurry	Nali mu ngeri ya bwangu
Now I couldn’t be alone with him	Kati nnali sisobola kubeera nzekka naye
Where is the logic in that?.	Ensonga eri ludda wa mu ekyo?.
I knew what he was going to say	Namanya kye yali agenda okwogera
Something is going on.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
That alone is all .	Ekyo kyokka kye kyokka .
But it’s what I love.	Naye nga kye njagala ennyo.
And he’s not going to let it happen again.	Era tagenda kuddamu kukkiriza kubaawo.
I can’t do that	Ekyo sisobola kukikola
He was friendly and happy.	Yali wa mukwano era nga musanyufu.
I can do it too	Nange nsobola okukikola
I could imagine him doing it	Nnali nsobola okulowooza nti akikola
I feel hopeful on this one	Mpulira nga nnina essuubi ku eno
You can never know.	Tosobola kumanya n’akatono.
I was planning on doing it anyway.	Nali nteekateeka kukikola mu ngeri yonna.
I was going to jail.	Nnali ngenda mu kkomera.
I couldn’t love anyone or anything	Nnali siyinza kwagala muntu yenna oba ekintu kyonna
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
Now was the moment.	Kati kye kyali akaseera.
You said he said he wanted a baby.	Wagamba nti yagamba ayagala mwana.
I’m sure he’ll agree	Nkakasa nti ajja kukkiriza
You really should have gone wrong.	Ddala wandibadde ogenda bulabe.
I do the same thing.	Nze nkola kye kimu.
I was probably lucky to have that	Oboolyawo nnali wa mukisa okufuna ekyo
I didn’t know what to say.	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera.
Like he knew it would.	Nga bwe yali akimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
We were both of us.	Twali ffembi.
I won’t do that to you or him	Ekyo sijja kukikola ggwe oba ye
That will be good.	Ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
Or, not really.	Oba, si ddala.
And not too close.	Era si kumpi nnyo.
But now that it is .	Naye kati nga bwe kiri .
I loved it too.	Nange nnali njagala nnyo.
I do like that.	Nze nkola nga bwe kiri.
I could live with this	Nnali nsobola okubeera ne kino
This is unusual for me.	Kino si kya bulijjo gyendi.
I need to be alone for a little while	Nze nneetaaga okubeera nzekka okumala akaseera katono
It doesn’t seem to be true.	Kirabika si kituufu.
I wasn’t really sure which	Mu butuufu nnali sikakasa ki
It’s not a good idea.	Si kirowoozo kirungi.
It’s really really good.	Ddala ddala kirungi.
It’s not a problem now.	Si kizibu kati.
That is until tonight.	Ekyo kiri okutuusa ekiro kino.
I still couldn’t see anything	N’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna
Really not good, he thought.	Ddala si kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
And in a way.	Era mu ngeri.
I know this all too well	Kino nkimanyi bulungi nnyo
I actually have to deal with the idea that	Mu butuufu nnina okukola ku ndowooza nti
Certainly.	Mazima ddala.
I couldn’t go anywhere	Nnali sisobola kugenda yonna
Please help here.	Nsaba obuyambi wano.
I couldn’t believe he was actually doing this	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti ddala kino yali akikola
I love to eat and so did he	Njagala nnyo okulya era naye bwe yakola
He can't go.	Tasobola kugenda.
I can easily do it	Nsobola bulungi okukikola
I am lucky in that regard.	Nnina omukisa mu nsonga eyo.
I was so close.	Nnali kumpi nnyo.
But my wife .	Naye mukyala wange .
You come on very strong.	Ojja ku maanyi nnyo.
He was a quick one.	Yali wa bwangu.
I wonder exactly who	Nneebuuza ddala ani
I have to get out of here.	Nnina okuva wano.
I’m afraid of everything	Ntya buli kimu
This was actually a good thing.	Kino mu butuufu kyali kintu kirungi.
But, it’s really true.	Naye, ddala kituufu.
It can happen.	Kiyinza okubaawo.
I was just in my room	Nnali mu kisenge kyange kyokka
What a beautiful place.	Nga kifo kirungi nnyo.
Not just any room.	Si kisenge kyonna kyokka.
I can’t quite believe it myself	Nze kennyini sisobola bulungi kukkiriza
I think you would like to be his girlfriend too	Ndowooza naawe wandyagadde okubeera muganzi we
The reason was he wanted to go to school.	Ensonga yali ayagala kugenda ku ssomero.
I don’t know, we’ll just have to see.	Simanyi, tujja kumala kulaba.
We can’t do this.	Kino tetusobola kukikola.
You’re happy.	Oli musanyufu.
It’s always the same.	Bulijjo kye kimu.
I know you know this	Nkimanyi nti kino okimanyi
I wanted to do it myself.	Nze kennyini nnali njagala kukikola.
He had to go home.	Yalina okudda eka.
I'm not good.	Siri mulungi.
I feel like everything looks good though.	Mpulira nga buli kimu kirabika bulungi wadde.
Maybe they were friends.	Mpozzi nga baali ba mukwano.
I knew it really wasn’t my business	Namanya nti ddala si nsonga yange
I’m not feeling well.	Nze siri bulungi.
I need to do it.	Nze nneetaaga okukikola.
It comes, it goes.	Kijja, kigenda.
I had no idea what he was thinking	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi kye yali alowooza
Someone else is with him.	Omuntu omulala ali naye.
It’s not something for everyone.	Si kintu kya buli muntu.
It was pretty good at that.	Kyali kirungi nnyo ku ekyo.
I really wanted that	Ekyo nnali njagala nnyo
I didn’t know how to do that	Ekyo nnali simanyi ngeri ya kukikola
I won’t be in the office tomorrow morning	Sijja kubeera mu ofiisi enkya ku makya
Occupation.	Omulimu.
But that's not how it started.	Naye bw'atyo si bwe yatandika.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I want to talk to him	Njagala kwogera naye
There was no way he would.	Tewali ngeri yonna gye yandikoze.
I wanted to see it all	Nnali njagala okulaba byonna
I am not ordinary.	Nze siri wa bulijjo.
That was his attitude.	Eyo ye yali endowooza ye.
In us and in us.	Mu ffe naffe.
I have everything.	Nnina buli kimu.
I don’t know if you know this.	Simanyi oba kino okimanyi.
I hope you won’t either	Nsuubira naawe tojja kukikola
Maybe his dad could.	Mpozzi taata we yali asobola.
They are probably fine with whatever you want to do.	Oboolyawo bali bulungi ne kyonna ky’oyagala okukola.
No one should know it’s there.	Tewali alina kumanya nti kiri awo.
You are not yourself.	Ggwe tolina ggwe kennyini.
Not a place, of course.	Si kifo, ddala.
The food was excellent.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
He is very happy about that.	Ekyo ali musanyufu nnyo.
That’s how it is now.	Kati bwe kiri.
I told my friend, here	Nagamba mukwano gwange, wano
I think we’ll stay here	Ndowooza tujja kusigala wano
But nothing seems to be happening.	Naye kirabika tewali kigenda mu maaso.
I think we have something here	Ndowooza wano tulina kye tulina
But there is no such thing.	Naye tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
I couldn’t see anything.	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
That’s the good thing.	Ekyo kye kirungi.
No one knew he was here.	Tewali yali amanyi nti yali wano.
I think that was absolutely true.	Ndowooza ekyo kyali kituufu ddala.
I didn’t have much to say	Nnali sirina bingi bye nnyinza kwogera
But we can’t.	Naye tetusobola.
I can’t do that from here.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola okuva wano.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
I know exactly what is going on	Nze mmanyi bulungi ekigenda mu maaso
He thought he was normal.	Yalowooza nti ye wa bulijjo.
At the time I was wondering	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali nneebuuza
He was strong you know.	Yali wa maanyi omanyi.
That’s what I expected	Ekyo nnali nsuubira
I was the one who loved it.	Nze nnali njagala nnyo.
I want more than anything.	Njagala okusinga ekintu kyonna.
I don’t know what he was doing there.	Simanyi kye yali akola eyo.
At the same time.	Mu kiseera kye kimu.
Until he is.	Okutuusa nga ye.
Not really knowledge.	Si ddala kumanya.
But he couldn’t eat.	Naye yali tasobola kulya.
Perhaps you can do that.	Oboolyawo ekyo osobola okukikola.
However, I had no problems	Kyokka nnali sirina buzibu bwonna
I could work with him	Nnali nsobola okukola naye
I don’t know what to make of this.	Simanyi kye nnyinza kukola ku kino.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe yali.
But there is hope.	Naye waliwo essuubi.
I just hope he's still here	Nsuubira kyokka nti akyali wano
I’m really scared.	Nze ddala ntya.
Although it is difficult.	Wadde nga kizibu.
I was early.	Nnali nga bukyali.
But he had to know.	Naye yalina okumanya.
We will spend about an hour in each location.	Tujja kumala essaawa nga emu mu buli kifo.
Not where it seems.	Si we kirabika.
I can’t do anything with him	Siyinza kukola kintu kyonna naye
Perhaps it is true.	Oboolyawo kituufu.
I need things.	Nze nneetaaga ebintu.
I wanted to be like him	Nnali njagala kubeera nga ye
Same thing with me.	Ekintu kye kimu nange.
I don't want a man like my father.	Saagala musajja nga taata.
It can happen.	Kiyinza okubaawo.
It was for everyone.	Kyali kya buli muntu.
She really looks like mine.	Ddala alabika nga wange.
Nobody wanted to be here.	Tewali yali ayagala kubeera wano.
I need to buy more cars every day	Nze nneetaaga okugula mmotoka nnyingi buli lunaku
No work today.	Tewali mulimu leero.
It was either him or us.	Yali ye oba ffe.
He wanted to stay.	Yali ayagala kusigala.
I don’t want anyone to know	Saagala muntu yenna kumanya
However, I must say this	Kyokka kino nnina okwogera
In fact, it felt pretty good.	Mu butuufu, yawulira bulungi nnyo.
I thought it might be him	Nalowooza nti yandiba nga ye ye
A very good friend.	Mukwano omulungi ennyo.
I don’t want to wait.	Saagala kulinda.
At this point, everyone knew.	Mu kiseera kino, buli omu yali akimanyi.
I want to be human again.	Njagala kuddamu kubeera muntu.
Neither method was ideal.	Tewali nkola yonna yali nnungi.
I can’t come today.	Sisobola kujja leero.
Maybe not though.	Mpozzi si bwe kiri wadde.
I know what’s going on here	Nze mmanyi ekigenda mu maaso wano
I want to talk to you about it.	Njagala kwogera naawe ku nsonga eyo.
We have to do it this way.	Tulina okukikola mu ngeri eno.
now it is the same.	kati bwe kiri.
That was good, kid, very good.	Ekyo kyali kirungi, mwana, kirungi nnyo.
It had to be here soon or he couldn't go.	Kyandibadde wano mu bbanga ttono oba si ekyo tayinza kugenda.
It really is as simple as that.	Mazima ddala kyangu nga ekyo.
I love working with him.	Njagala nnyo okukola naye.
This was a prison.	Kino kyali kya kkomera.
I couldn’t speak	Nnali sisobola kwogera
He had no idea there was such a thing.	Yali talina kirowoozo nti waliwo ekintu ng’ekyo.
That’s really nothing.	Ekyo ddala si kintu kyonna.
I will do this	Kino nja kukikola
I knew we didn’t have to	Nali nkimanyi nti tetulina kukikola
I am just one person.	Nze ndi muntu omu yekka.
This was either going to work, or not.	Kino oba kyali kigenda kukola, oba obutakola.
Not my friend.	Si mukwano gwange.
I'm going home.	Ngenda waka.
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola.
I don’t know why, or even when.	Simanyi lwaki, oba wadde ddi.
But it’s a little more complicated than that.	Naye kizibu katono ekyo okusinga.
I’m no good for you	Nze sirina mulungi gy’oli
We are like-minded.	Ffe tuli ba ndowooza emu.
It seems to be the same here.	Kirabika ne wano bwe kiri.
I have no idea about that.	Ekyo sirina kye mmanyi.
I can drive there for the night	Nsobola okuvuga eyo okumala ekiro
He was real.	Yali wa ddala.
Certainly not for you.	Mazima ddala si ku ggwe.
My father was there too.	Taata naye yali awo.
Not too fast though.	Si mangu nnyo wadde.
I was so in love with it	Nnali njagala nnyo
Asleep, mostly.	Nga yeebase, okusinga.
I need more than that	Nze nneetaaga okusinga ekyo
No response, so far.	Tewali kuddamu, okutuusa kati.
I wanted to know if you were home	Nnali njagala okumanya oba oli waka
This probably won’t work.	Kino osanga tekijja kukola.
You are not yourself.	Ggwe si ggwe kennyini.
I didn’t think he would stay in town	Nnali sirowooza nti ajja kusigala mu kibuga
It’s not a policy.	Si nkola.
I knew it had to be you	Namanya nti kyalina okuba ggwe
It’s the money.	Ye ssente.
I thought you wanted to be alone	Nalowooza nti oyagala kubeera wekka
I had it easy until now	Nnali nfunye nga kyangu okutuusa kati
I had gotten one at a time.	Nnali nfunye emu ku emu.
I know this to be absolutely true	Kino nkimanyi nti kituufu ddala
Or he told me he was.	Oba yang’amba nti yali.
But no, he thought he never would.	Naye nedda, yalowooza nti tajja kukikola n’akatono.
I need help with this	Nneetaaga obuyambi ku nsonga eno
I still can’t believe this is happening	N’okutuusa kati siyinza kukkiriza nti kino kigenda mu maaso
I didn’t know if you would	Nnali simanyi oba ojja kukikola
He might have done this.	Kino yandiba nga yakikola.
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
Now you have to get out of here.	Kati olina okuva wano.
That’s a good thing.	Ekyo kintu kirungi.
I expected to see someone	Nali nsuubira okulaba omuntu
He felt a little better.	Yawulira bulungi katono.
And they are strong.	Era ba maanyi.
I'm not really in the plan.	Mu butuufu siri mu nteekateeka.
This is not an opinion.	Eno si ndowooza.
He is fine now.	Ali bulungi kati.
He had been here.	Yali abadde wano.
But there is no hurry.	Naye tewali bwangu.
I don’t want to be here either.	Nze nange saagala kubeera wano.
What he said was that.	Kye yayogera kyali nti.
Everyone knows that’s not true.	Buli omu akimanyi nti ekyo si kituufu.
I don't know how.	Simanyi ngeri ki.
I was thinking about you today	Nali ndowooza ku ggwe leero
There is or there is not.	Waliwo oba nedda.
I was really and truly sick	Ddala era ddala nnali mulwadde
I really didn’t know what to expect	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kye nnali nsuubira
Anyone can see why.	Omuntu yenna asobola okulaba lwaki.
I’m sure everything will be fine	Nkakasa nti buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi
I guess that would be a good thing	Ntebereza nti ekyo kyandibadde kintu kirungi
I had no idea you could do this	Nnali sirina kirowoozo nti kino osobola okukikola
But he could do this.	Naye kino yali asobola okukikola.
Certainly not good.	Mazima ddala si kirungi.
I know he's not a police officer.	Nkimanyi si wa poliisi.
Now this can be a problem.	Kati kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
Not in this case.	Si mu mbeera eno.
I'll be back tomorrow morning	Nja kudda enkya ku makya
I didn’t know how to proceed	Nali simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso
I was very nervous early on	Nnali ntya nnyo nga bukyali
That’s what it is.	Kye kiri.
Not very happy with you.	Si musanyufu nnyo naawe.
I just work hard every week.	Nze buli wiiki nkola nnyo kyokka.
A moment, he said.	Akaseera katono, bwe yagamba.
And it’s going to be difficult.	Era kigenda kuba kizibu.
However, it is up to you.	Kyokka, kiri eri ggwe.
He couldn’t come to me.	Yali tasobola kujja gyendi.
In the evening.	Akawungeezi.
You’ll find something everyone wants.	Ojja kufuna ky’ayagala buli muntu.
It is very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo.
I think it was bad	Nze ndowooza nti kyali kibi
Everything goes to the same place.	Buli kimu kigenda mu kifo kimu.
I loved that thing.	Ekintu ekyo nnali njagala nnyo.
What's the problem, it wasn't.	Kiki ekizibu, si bwe kyali.
This is exactly the same.	Kino kye kimu ddala.
I could see it.	Nnali nsobola okulaba.
And we’re going to be right down the hall.	Era tugenda kuba wansi ddala mu kisenge.
He needs time.	Yeetaaga obudde.
But this is not uncommon.	Naye kino si kya bulijjo.
You me, we can’t do this alone.	Ggwe nze, kino tetusobola kukikola ffekka.
He will love it.	Ajja kwagala nnyo.
I will never do it again	Sijja kuddamu kukikola
I don’t want anything.	Nze sirina kye njagala.
This is happening now.	Kino kigenda mu maaso kati.
I just wanted to be with you	Nze nnali njagala nnyo kubeera naawe kyokka
I want to do this.	Kino njagala kukikola.
Everything is very complicated.	Buli kimu kizibu nnyo.
But it’s not very good.	Naye si kirungi nnyo.
I love it here.	Njagala nnyo wano.
Perhaps we are too.	Oboolyawo naffe tuli.
I know you can read this.	Nkimanyi nti osobola okusoma bino.
That would be a little better.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi katono.
I was supposed to be here before	Nze nali wa kubeera wano emabegako
Maybe not now, but it would work.	Mpozzi si kati, naye yandikoze.
I can’t do that, not now	Ekyo sisobola kukikola, si kati
He really did what he needed to be.	Ddala yakola kye yeetaaga okuba.
Can someone please help.	Omuntu asobola nsaba okuyamba.
I love my job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwange.
I love being a guy.	Njagala nnyo okubeera ggaayi.
I really didn’t know what to expect	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kye nnali nsuubira
This is what he told me.	Bino bye yang’amba.
I wanted to go home then	Nnali njagala kudda waka mu kiseera ekyo
I couldn’t stay much longer	Nnali siyinza kumala bbanga ddene nnyo
That's like us.	Oyo nga ffe.
I am well aware of that	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi
I was hoping it would happen soon	Nali nsuubira nti kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono
That seems to be the idea.	Ekyo kirabika kye kirowoozo.
That will do it.	Ekyo kijja kukikola.
I have been in that house	Mbadde mu nnyumba eyo
But at the same time, it really isn’t.	Naye mu kiseera kye kimu, mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
It was time to go to work.	Kyali kiseera okugenda ku mulimu.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
I can never come home to you again	Siyinza kuddamu kudda waka gy’oli
This was not what he needed right now.	Kino si kye yali yeetaaga mu kiseera kino.
I was very young at the time	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali muto nnyo
He could hardly answer.	Yali tasobola bulungi kuddamu.
Today’s problem is the same.	Ekizibu kya leero kye kimu.
I am not a doctor.	Nze siri musawo.
What he wanted.	Kye yali ayagala.
He can't speak.	Tasobola kwogera.
What is going to happen?.	Kiki ekigenda okubaawo?.
This was very easy.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo.
As in day to day.	Nga bwe kiri mu lunaku ku lunaku.
And that's why.	Era y'ensonga lwaki.
My father went to his office very early.	Taata yagenda mu ofiisi ye nga bukyali nnyo.
I’m kind of a good person.	Nze ndi mu ngeri ya muntu mulungi.
I thought he would never come back here	Nalowooza nti tajja kudda wano
You're in.	Oli mu.
I was so deserving of that	Nnali nsaanidde nnyo ekyo
But no one came near me.	Naye tewali yajja kumpi nange.
And here it will remain.	Era wano kijja kusigala.
In this process.	Mu nkola eno.
I don’t know where to go	Simanyi gye nnyinza kugenda
He thought about how happy he was.	Yalowooza ku ngeri gye yali musanyufu gye yali.
This is what he loves to do.	Kino ky’ayagala ennyo okukola.
I can’t believe my good fortune	Siyinza kukkiriza mukisa gwange omulungi
One for each child.	Omu ku buli mwana.
I wonder where.	Nneebuuza wa.
I know nothing about this.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eno.
However, he felt better for a little while.	Kyokka, yawulira bulungi okumala akaseera katono.
Not that he needs to talk.	Si nti yeetaaga okwogera.
I thought about my sin	Nalowooza ku kibi kyange
I like to be alone	Njagala nnyo okubeera nzekka
That's a thing.	Ekyo kintu.
But he still couldn’t believe it.	Naye n’okutuusa kati yali tasobola kukkiriza.
I don’t know when and how	Simanyi ddi era ngeri ki
I was young and beautiful	Nnali muto era nga ndi mulungi
There’s someone there.	Waliwo omuntu awo.
It’s very good for me.	Kirungi nnyo gyendi.
Either it’s a good thing or not.	Oba kintu kirungi oba nedda.
I knew what it looked like	Namanya bwe kyali kirabika
I think you should go home, now	Ndowooza wandibadde ogenda awaka, kati
This book is in good condition.	Ekitabo kino kiri mu mbeera nnungi.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
I think it looks great	Ndowooza kirabika bulungi nnyo
I won’t always be here	Sijja kubeera wano bulijjo
But he must act quickly.	Naye alina okukola amangu.
This will definitely help.	Kino mazima ddala kijja kuyamba.
I wondered how he knew all this	Nneebuuza engeri gye yali amanyi bino byonna
I’m sure he’ll be fine now.	Nkakasa nti kati ajja kuba bulungi.
He didn’t even know where they were.	Yali tamanyi na gye baali.
I know this is a very difficult time for you	Nkimanyi nti kino kiseera kizibu nnyo gy’oli
I don’t know much about it.	Simanyi bingi ku nsonga eyo.
No one knew for sure.	Tewali yali amanyi bulungi.
That was him.	Oyo ye yali ye.
He has to do this alone.	Kino alina okukikola yekka.
I didn’t know what to say again	Nnali simanyi kya kuddamu kwogera
Not a very good job.	Si mulimu mulungi nnyo.
Without the film it will be difficult.	Nga tewali firimu kijja kuba kizibu.
He was here, but he wasn’t.	Yali wano, naye nga si bwe yali.
And he was very good.	Era yali mulungi nnyo.
Not for him, not for anyone.	Si ye, si ya muntu yenna.
Now that’s a problem.	Kati ekyo kizibu.
Surely this is no man’s work.	Mazima guno si mulimu gwa muntu.
I hope you’re having a moment	Nsuubira nti olina akaseera
We can go home now.	Tusobola okudda eka kati.
A.	Omu.
Only one will work.	Omu yekka y’ajja okukola.
This will be difficult.	Kino kijja kuba kizibu.
I'll be fine though	Nja kuba bulungi wadde
He couldn’t do anything.	Yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I’m glad you’re okay.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli bulungi.
It doesn’t really matter why.	Si kikulu nnyo lwaki.
I don’t know everything.	Simanyi buli kimu.
Something is going on.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
Not a real person.	Si muntu ddala.
It probably won’t be too bad.	Oboolyawo tekijja kuba kibi nnyo.
In his case, it was somewhere.	Mu mbeera ye, waliwo we kyali.
I can’t go on without you	Siyinza kugenda mu maaso nga tolina
There is no me.	Tewali nze.
But that may be just around the corner.	Naye ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kiri mu bbanga ttono.
He certainly knows it.	Mazima ddala akimanyi.
I have no idea who it is	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ani
I don’t have it and I never will.	Sirina era sijja kukikola.
I was happy to do it	Nnali musanyufu okukikola
And now you are here.	Era kati oli wano.
And here too.	Era ne wano.
He didn't even know what to say.	Yali tamanyi na kya kwogera.
I wondered that too	Ekyo nange nnali nneebuuza
And then it is.	Era awo bwe kiri.
Will be back with you soon.	Ajja kudda naawe mu bbanga ttono.
He did well there.	Yakola bulungi eyo.
I didn’t know where I was going.	Nnali simanyi wa gye nnali ngenda.
They are always together.	Bulijjo bali wamu.
I’m working, too.	Nze nange nkola.
And yet he wasn’t.	Era naye nga si bwe yali.
And so he must act.	Era bw’atyo alina okukola.
I was working hard	Nnali nkola nnyo
However, you are in luck.	Kyokka oli mu mukisa.
He has been in the.	Abadde mu...
I just know it will work	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti kijja kukola
I'll try the house.	Nja kugezaako ennyumba.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
I thought about my situation for a moment	Nalowooza ku mbeera yange okumala akaseera
He felt a little like that now.	Yawulira nga bw’atyo katono kati.
Leaving the house.	Okuva mu nnyumba.
Everyone for everyone.	Buli omu ku buli muntu.
It's not you.	Si ggwe.
That was my father.	Oyo ye yali taata wange.
But he apparently thought he could himself.	Naye kirabika yalowooza nti ye kennyini asobola.
But, maybe not.	Naye, mpozzi si bwe kiri.
I had no money on me	Nnali sirina ssente ku nze
There is only me.	Waliwo nze nzekka.
Now, we are though.	Kati, tuli wadde.
Neither you nor he.	Wadde ggwe wadde ye.
I’m almost there.	Nze ndi kumpi okutuuka awo.
When he was my friend, my best friend.	Bwe yali mukwano gwange, mukwano gwange ennyo.
I have so much to do	Nnina bingi nnyo bye nnina okukola
It’s not something without it.	Si kintu nga tewali.
I wanted to move on but didn’t know how	Nnali njagala kugenda mu maaso naye nga simanyi ngeri ki
I am so beautiful.	Nze ndi mulungi nnyo.
I think he will do very well	Ndowooza ajja kukola bulungi nnyo
But, this morning, he was looking strong.	Naye, enkya ya leero, yali alabika nga wa maanyi.
It’s not dangerous.	Si kya bulabe.
I really hoped you would	Ddala nnali nsuubira nti ojja kukikola
I think you should go	Ndowooza wandibadde ogenda
We have something for everyone!.	Tulina kye tulina eri buli muntu!.
It would be all right.	Kyandibadde kirungi buli kimu.
I really have no idea why.	Mazima ddala sirina kye mmanyi lwaki.
Now you can't.	Kati tosobola.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
I guess he told the truth	Ntebereza nti yayogera mazima
Everyone but him.	Buli muntu okuggyako ye.
I am very curious.	Njagala nnyo okumanya.
It’s not your system.	Si nkola yo.
But that’s not really the case.	Naye ekyo mu butuufu si kye kituufu.
I needed to get out of this place	Nnali nneetaaga okuva mu kifo kino
He works without problems.	Akola nga talina buzibu.
Not that he was .	Si nti yali .
He didn’t want to do it.	Yali tayagala kukikola.
However, that is just me.	Kyokka ekyo nze nzekka.
He is definitely the best.	Mazima ddala asinga.
I still couldn’t believe it	Nnali n’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kukkiriza
So was my father.	Bw’atyo ne taata wange bwe yali.
And that’s actually pretty cool.	Era ekyo mu butuufu kirungi nnyo.
He doesn't have anything.	Talina ky'alina.
I think that’s very important.	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo.
I hope he does well	Nsuubira nti akola bulungi
He was on her side.	Yali ku ludda lwe.
I thought he was a little young	Nalowooza nti yali muto katono
But now it doesn’t matter.	Naye kati si kikulu.
I wonder why he did it	Nneebuuza lwaki yakikola
Which he didn’t have.	Kye yali talina.
I was so excited	Nnali musanyufu nnyo
But he didn’t have much of a job.	Naye yali talina nnyo mulimu.
Now here it was.	Kati wano we kyali.
And you should, too.	Era naawe wandibadde.
It is the point in point.	Ye nsonga mu nsonga.
But he's been thinking a lot about the police.	Naye abadde alowooza nnyo ku poliisi.
I didn’t want to be home	Nnali saagala kubeera waka
It’s hard to see but it’s important.	Kizibu okulaba naye kikulu.
Maybe even a little bit.	Mpozzi n’akatono.
There is nothing positive about it	Tewali kintu kyonna kirungi ku nsonga eyo
I wonder about this thing.	Nze nneebuuza ku kintu kino.
I think we can do much better.	Ndowooza tusobola okukola obulungi ennyo.
Everyone wants to make money.	Buli omu ayagala okufuna ssente.
I had no intention of going from here	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kya kugenda okuva wano
I was feeling very strong	Nali mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi nnyo
He had only one.	Yalina omu yekka.
I couldn’t process what he was saying	Nnali sisobola kukola ku bye yali ayogera
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
Money I didn’t want	Ssente ze nnali saagala
But this is true.	Naye kino kituufu.
But the point is this.	Naye ensonga eri nti eno.
A very nice guy.	Ggaayi omulungi ennyo.
Perhaps we are.	Oboolyawo bwe tuli.
But not in my house.	Naye si mu nnyumba yange.
This may be the case for you.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri gy’oli.
I won’t believe it, of course	Sijja kukkiriza, ddala
I love it, actually.	Njagala nnyo, mu butuufu.
I feel so much better already.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo dda.
It was supposed to be three.	Yali ya kuba ssatu.
Not really.	Si ddala.
Would that really be too hard?.	Ddala ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo?.
Everything is fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
Not not really.	Si si ddala.
Everything seems to be in good shape.	Kirabika buli kimu kiri mu mbeera nnungi.
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t.	Sisobola, sisobola, sisobola.
That's all.	Ekyo kyokka.
I'm not sure anyone really knows.	Sikakasa nti ddala waliwo amanyi.
I know it’s not you.	Nkimanyi nti si ggwe.
Not his father.	Si taata we.
I had no idea who he was	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi nti ani
But he felt the same way.	Naye naye yawulira bw’atyo.
It’s a good idea.	Kirowoozo kirungi.
I wasn’t sure it would actually happen.	Nali sikakasa nti kijja kubaawo ddala.
No one can know.	Tewali ayinza kumanya.
This movie is a real work.	Firimu eno ya mulimu ddala.
I have a plan.	Nnina enteekateeka.
But no one knows anything.	Naye tewali amanyi kintu kyonna.
That person.	Omuntu oyo.
I will be	Nja kuba .
This is not the case now.	Kino si bwe kiri kati.
He can do that.	Ekyo asobola okukikola.
I’m sure he did.	Nkakasa nti yakikola.
This is not easy.	Kino si kyangu.
He went to work.	Yagenda ku mulimu.
Someone there could help.	Omuntu ali eyo yali asobola okuyamba.
That it will be around for a long time.	Nti kijja kubeerawo okumala ebbanga ddene.
I could only think of him	Nnali nsobola okulowooza ku ye yekka
I wish you were there too, but you’re not.	Njagala naawe wali, naye si bwe kiri.
I was afraid.	Nali ntya.
I hope this stays the same.	Nsuubira nti kino kijja kusigala nga bwe kiri.
I was both nervous and excited at the same time	Bombi nnali ntya era nga ndi musanyufu mu kiseera kye kimu
This might work.	Kino kiyinza okukola.
Someone has to be home.	Omuntu alina okuba awaka.
That you were going to do what you loved.	Nti wali ogenda kukola ekyo kye wali oyagala ennyo.
I knew this wasn’t true	Namanya nti kino si kituufu
And that, he thought, was that.	Era ekyo, yalowooza, kye kyali ekyo.
Why was he even here.	Lwaki yali ne wano.
I’m sure he’ll be fine	Nkakasa nti ajja kuba bulungi
At that time you were .	Mu kiseera ekyo wali .
I think this may be the case with this.	Ndowooza kino kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri ku kino.
It is easy for a person.	Kyangu eri omuntu.
I thought he did.	Nnalowooza nti yakikola.
I don't know what's going on with this	Simanyi kigenda mu maaso ku nsonga eno
I need to get out of this, out of everything	Nze nneetaaga okuva mu kino, okuva mu buli kimu
He himself does not know what it is.	Ye kennyini tamanyi kye kiri.
But it was something.	Naye kyali kintu.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kintu kye kimu.
It’s a very good thing.	Kintu kirungi nnyo.
I didn’t know what was going on	Nnali simanyi kyali kigenda mu maaso
He was with us.	Yali naffe.
Not really, but probably.	Si ddala, naye oboolyawo.
Good, he thought.	Kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
I feel so happy right now	Mpulira nga ndi musanyufu nnyo mu kiseera kino
That was a very important thing for me	Ekyo kyali kintu kikulu nnyo gyendi
But we’ll be fine.	Naye tujja kuba bulungi.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
I'm not quite sure what to do.	Sikakasa bulungi kya kukola.
I love someone who thinks	Njagala nnyo omuntu alowooza
There is no reason why you should be.	Tewali nsonga lwaki olina okuba.
But he could do it.	Naye yali asobola okukikola.
I needed to leave now	Nnali nneetaaga okuva awo kati
I had nothing to do.	Nnali sirina kye nkola.
I don’t like it at all	Sikyagala n’akatono
I guess it’s good.	Ntebereza nti kirungi.
To move forward.	Okugenda mu maaso.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
I don’t want anything.	Nze sirina kye njagala.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
I wanted to know what was going on.	Nnali njagala okumanya ekigenda mu maaso.
We can't.	Tetusobola.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
I hoped he was safe.	Nnali nsuubira nti yali talina bulabe.
Everyone has it.	Buli muntu alina.
He didn’t have it.	Yali talina.
I could work with you	Nnali nsobola okukola naawe
I couldn’t talk, I didn’t want to talk	Nnali sisobola kwogera, saagala kwogera
I am well aware of that.	Nze ekyo nkimanyi bulungi.
Really, really good.	Ddala, ddala kirungi.
He was telling the truth.	Yali ayogera mazima.
The friend he needed	Mukwano gwe yali yeetaaga
And he was willing to do that.	Era ekyo yali mwetegefu okukikola.
I was my best friend	Nnali mukwano gwange nnyo
I’m here,’ he said.	Nze wano,’ bwe yagambye.
That’s nothing, but it’s also nothing.	Ekyo si kintu kyonna, naye era si kintu.
That’s probably the problem for me.	Ekyo osanga kye kizibu gyendi.
I hope he’ll be fine	Nsuubira nti ajja kuba bulungi
I loved it on him	Nnali njagala nnyo ku ye
I’m sure he will, of course, too.	Nkakasa nti ajja kukikola, ddala, naye.
This is not an easy time.	Kino si kiseera kyangu.
I’m more than he is.	Nze okusinga ye.
Why we are the way we are	Lwaki tuli mu ngeri gye tuli
And he always does it well	Era bulijjo akikola bulungi
Maybe he would.	Mpozzi yandikoze.
That was all he needed.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali yeetaaga.
No, it really isn’t.	Nedda, ddala si bwe kiri.
He certainly wasn’t.	Mazima ddala si bwe yali.
This is the time.	Kino kye kiseera.
He makes a lot more money than we do.	Akola ssente nnyingi nnyo okusinga ffe.
I wanted to be like my dad	Nnali njagala okubeera nga taata wange
You would be really good at that.	Ekyo wandibadde mulungi ddala.
There is no truth.	Tewali mazima.
That’s not easy.	Ekyo si kyangu.
I was afraid of that	Ekyo nnali ntya
He had to get home.	Yalina okutuuka awaka.
I didn’t quite know what to say.	Nnali simanyi bulungi kya kwogera.
Everyone is safe.	Buli muntu talina bulabe.
Of course, the night would be better.	Kya lwatu nti ekiro kyandibadde kirungi.
We are not well off.	Ffe tetulina bulungi.
No one in the film is really doing the right thing.	Tewali muntu yenna mu firimu eno akola ddala kituufu.
He wasn't quite himself.	Yali si ye kennyini nnyo.
I hope he is not sick.	Nsuubira nti si mulwadde.
I will never talk to him again	Sijja kuddamu kwogera naye
I like to go a lot.	Njagala nnyo okugenda nnyo.
From now on.	Okuva kati.
I can’t wait much longer	Siyinza kulinda bbanga ddene nnyo
I deserved to be here	Nnali nsaanidde okubeera wano
For both of them, food did it.	Ku bombi, emmere ye yakikola.
We have it.	Tulina.
I thought it would be me	Nalowooza nti yandibadde nze
I won’t do anything at all	Sijja kukola kintu kyonna n’akatono
Of course it can happen.	Kya lwatu kiyinza okubaawo.
I need to see exactly what he wants	Nze nneetaaga okulaba ddala ky’ayagala
That was the clock.	Eyo ye yali essaawa.
I’d say it was mine	Nze n’agamba nti yali wange
He couldn’t talk to her.	Yali tasobola kwogera naye.
I was really sick.	Ddala nnali mulwadde.
This is the movie you wanted to see.	Eno ye firimu gye wali oyagala okulaba.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
But, it doesn’t seem like it.	Naye, kirabika nga si bwe kiri.
As it was the case.	Nga bwe kyali.
It's not his.	Si ya ye.
I will be there this afternoon	Nja kubeerawo akawungeezi ka leero
He needs someone like you.	Yeetaaga omuntu nga ggwe.
I have been lucky.	Nze mbadde wa mukisa.
I will do this very quickly	Kino nja kukikola mu bwangu ddala
I feel he is ready to move on safely	Mpulira nga mwetegefu okugenda mu maaso nga talina bulabe
It would have been easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu.
I didn’t even have one	Nze nali sirina wadde emu
I wonder if you can say the same	Nze nneebuuza oba osobola okwogera ekintu kye kimu
It could be anything, really.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna, ddala.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
Maybe that’s a bad answer.	Mpozzi ekyo kya kuddamu kibi.
It doesn’t really matter.	Si kikulu nnyo.
He works hard for me.	Akola nnyo gyendi.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kintu kye kimu.
That's his point.	Eyo y'ensonga ye.
However, we need to address the fact that there is an issue.	Kyokka twetaaga okukola ku nsonga nti waliwo ensonga.
I still can’t believe it	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kukkiriza
He knew now all too well.	Yali amanyi kati bulungi nnyo.
As and when.	Nga ne ddi.
That was a really good watch.	Eyo yali ssaawa nnungi ddala.
It is true as it is.	Kituufu nga bwe kiri.
You have to win here, you know.	Olina okuwangula wano, omanyi.
I love having everyone home.	Njagala nnyo okubeera ne buli muntu awaka.
I don’t want to talk about that.	Ekyo saagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
I was thinking positively of you.	Nnali ndowooza bulungi ku ggwe.
Or so he said.	Oba bwe yagamba.
You’re a fast person, or you’re not.	Oli muntu wa mangu, oba nedda.
Let him do what he wants.	Akole ky’ayagala.
I think that’s too easy	Ndowooza ekyo kyangu nnyo
It’s hard to see why.	Kizibu okulaba lwaki.
This is my place.	Kino kye kifo kyange.
I know it’s going to happen	Nkimanyi nti kigenda kubaawo
I'm afraid, he thought.	Ntya, bwe yalowooza.
We are the truthful ones.	Ffe tuli ba mazima.
This is a complex problem.	Kino kizibu kizibu.
I feel pretty good about it all	Mpulira bulungi nnyo ku byonna
I can’t believe how easy this is	Siyinza kukkiriza ngeri kino gye kyangu
It was something.	Kyali kintu.
He shouldn’t be here.	Tasaanidde kubeera wano.
He must be working.	Ateekwa okuba ng’akola.
I think he’ll be just fine	Ndowooza ajja kuba bulungi nnyo
I know what’s going on	Nze mmanyi ekigenda mu maaso
I doubt it will be the same	Nbuusabuusa nti kijja kuba kye kimu
I was so nervous and scared	Nali ntya nnyo era nga ntya nnyo
I thought of the child	Nalowooza ku mwana
I thought it was great	Nalowooza nti kirungi nnyo
Without the money.	Nga tewali ssente.
And he was sick.	Era yali mulwadde.
He knew that fact.	Ensonga eyo yali amanyi.
Continuation .	Okugenda mu maaso .
I needed to reach my son	Nnali nneetaaga okutuuka ku mwana wange
I won’t do that.	Ekyo sijja kukikola.
I needed to get out of the house	Nnali nneetaaga okuva mu nnyumba
Indeed, I am very sorry.	Mazima ddala, nsonyiwa nnyo.
But for how long.	Naye okumala ebbanga ki.
You’re not the same.	Ggwe si bwe kiri.
He has been doing it.	Abadde akikola.
I have to do it right with him	Nnina okukikola obulungi naye
I have to deal with him being in the room	Nnina okukola ku ye okubeera mu kisenge
I didn’t know too much about it	Nze nali simanyi bingi nnyo ku nsonga eyo
I will never do it again	Sijja kuddamu kukikola
And the point isn’t that it’s so hard.	Era ensonga si nti kizibu nnyo.
I just need to stay a little longer	Nze nneetaaga okumala akaseera katono kyokka
And he doesn’t have it.	Era talina.
It’s really easy.	Ddala kyangu.
And they are here.	Era bali wano.
I thought it might be something	Nalowooza nti kiyinza okuba ekintu
We’ll try things your way.	Tujja kugezaako ebintu mu ngeri yo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
I wonder why he did that	Nze nneebuuza lwaki yakola ekyo
AN! 	E!
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo.
Of course, I was too young to be there	Kya lwatu nti nnali muto nnyo nga sisobola kubeerawo
It’s not just that.	Si ekyo kyokka.
I need somewhere to really live soon	Nze nneetaaga we nnyinza okubeera ddala mu bbanga ttono
And even now.	Era ne kati.
I am in trouble.	Ndi mu buzibu.
Now, not so much.	Kati, si nnyo.
I know how important that is to you	Nkimanyi nti ekyo kikulu nnyo gy’oli
But that’s all.	Naye ekyo kyokka.
This is the same thing.	Kino kye kimu.
I am nothing like you	Nze siri kintu kyonna nga ggwe
That's why there's hope.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki waliwo essuubi.
He would do well.	Yandikoze bulungi.
I'm fine, doing better than usual, actually	Ndi bulungi, nkola bulungi okusinga bulijjo, mu butuufu
Now they are everywhere.	Kati bali buli wamu.
That might be coming.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kijja.
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
I think this will work well	Ndowooza kino kijja kukola bulungi
You have to have it.	Olina okuba nga olina.
I won’t talk to him.	Sijja kwogera naye.
And there we were.	Era awo we twali.
I didn’t quite know what to say	Nnali simanyi bulungi kya kwogera
I just need it.	Nze kye nneetaaga kyokka.
I will never do it again	Sijja kuddamu kukikola
When my father said	Taata bwe yagamba .
It is in perfect condition.	Kiri mu mbeera nnungi ddala.
No one knew who we were.	Tewali yali amanyi kye tuli.
His only friend at work.	Mukwano gwe yekka ku mulimu.
Only my father knew.	Taata yekka ye yali amanyi.
Anything can happen baby.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo mwana.
I said we could do it anyway.	Nagamba nti tusobola okukikola mu ngeri yonna.
I want to be that person too	Nze nange njagala kubeera muntu oyo
He wants to be a doctor.	Ayagala kubeera musawo.
Nothing good about.	Tewali kirungi ku.
It’s really quite easy to do.	Ddala kyangu nnyo okukola.
I need your opinion on something.	Nneetaaga endowooza yo ku kintu.
I have a problem though	Nnina ekizibu wadde
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
Everyone was anyone.	Buli muntu oyo yali muntu yenna.
I was too busy studying	Nnali bbize nnyo okusoma
I want to know what the problem is.	Njagala okumanya obuzibu bwe buli.
Now this is very important.	Kati kino kikulu nnyo.
I need to get out of that house	Nze nneetaaga okuva mu nnyumba eyo
I don’t know if that’s true.	Simanyi oba ekyo kituufu.
I feel completely vulnerable	Mpulira nga ndi mu bulabe ddala
He felt very comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo.
I wanted to know why.	Nnali njagala okumanya lwaki.
Much younger than my father.	Muto nnyo okusinga taata.
I couldn’t do anything.	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
That only matters to you.	Ekyo kikulu gy’oli kyokka.
I want to talk to him	Njagala okwogera naye
I could feel someone nearby	Nnali mpulira nga waliwo omuntu ali kumpi
Or we can do it your way.	Oba tusobola okukikola mu ngeri yo.
But that's just me being me.	Naye ekyo nze nzekka okubeera nze.
But that’s the point here.	Naye eyo y’ensonga wano.
This is his time.	Kino kye kiseera kye.
I can’t believe it’s really mine	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ddala wange
But not here.	Naye si wano.
I have no idea what this could be.	Sirina kirowoozo ku kino kye kiyinza okuba.
We’re going to have to see.	Tugenda kuba tulina okulaba.
He knew who we were.	Yali amanyi kye tuli.
Something as well.	Ekintu nga bwe kiri obulungi.
The point is, he's a good guy.	Ensonga eri nti, ye ggaayi mulungi.
I should have gone earlier	Nnali nsaanidde okugenda nga bukyali
I’ll do whatever you want	Nja kukola kyonna ky’oyagala
I needed this.	Kino nnali nneetaaga.
But, it’s pretty good.	Naye, kirungi nnyo.
This was very, very bad.	Kino kyali kibi nnyo nnyo.
And then, for the most part, it’s good.	Era awo, okusinga, kirungi.
That’s going to be us.	Ekyo kigenda kuba ffe.
Like me, actually.	Nga nze, mu butuufu.
He did this.	Kino yakikola.
I don't know.	Simanyi.
All of us, all of us.	Ffenna ffenna.
And he was talking.	Era yali ayogera.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
But he has no quick way.	Naye talina ngeri ya bwangu.
I was very happy with this.	Kino nnali musanyufu nnyo.
I love my wife very much	Njagala nnyo mukyala wange
It's just too bad.	Kibi nnyo kyokka.
As he did.	Nga bwe yakola.
But, he was a teacher.	Naye, yali musomesa.
I want to go there.	Njagala kugenda eyo.
But I hope not too long.	Naye nsuubira nti si bbanga ddene nnyo.
That’s not like you.	Ekyo si nga ggwe.
And yet, they are there.	Era naye, bali awo.
I want your opinion on this product	Njagala endowooza yo ku kintu kino
I still had nothing to say	N’okutuusa kati nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera
She was indeed very good.	Mazima ddala yali mulungi nnyo.
I will never be in that situation again	Sijja kuddamu kubeera mu mbeera eyo
You don’t know what it is.	Tomanyi kye kiri.
This is the opportunity.	Guno gwe mukisa.
This is important to us.	Kino kikulu gye tuli.
This was a good thing.	Kino kyali kirungi.
He knew he was lucky.	Yali akimanyi nti wa mukisa.
Not no way.	Si tewali ngeri yonna.
It’s not serious.	Si kya maanyi.
That's the thing.	Ekyo kye kintu.
But it was hard to work with him.	Naye kyali kizibu okukola naye.
You know.	Omanyi.
But for now, that’s all we can do.	Naye mu kiseera kino, ekyo kyokka kye tusobola okukola.
However, I didn’t know what to do about it	Kyokka nnali simanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo
I had no idea what to expect	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku kye nnali nsuubira
He may well have.	Ayinza bulungi okuba nga yalina.
It was a moment of truth.	Kyali kiseera kya mazima.
However, I couldn’t do it	Kyokka nnali sisobola kukikola
I hope you can as well	Nsuubira nti osobola nga bwe kiri
You certainly can’t be that .	Mazima ddala tosobola kuba ekyo .
It is very, very true.	Kituufu nnyo nnyo.
It was a really hard time for me.	Kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo ddala gyendi.
He was a little scared.	Yali atya katono.
And his wife.	Ne mukyala we.
He didn’t have to do it.	Yali talina kukikola.
I was ready to go except for one thing.	Nali mwetegefu okugenda okuggyako ekintu kimu.
I think you should do the same	Ndowooza naawe wandibadde okola kye kimu
But in reality,.	Naye mu butuufu,...
I wanted one myself.	Nze kennyini nnali njagala emu.
However, he is not a singer.	Kyokka si muyimbi.
I think she was a very lonely woman	Ndowooza yali mukyala abeera yekka nnyo
But now he knew better.	Naye kati yali amanyi bulungi.
It was time for him to do the same.	Kyali kiseera naye akole kye kimu.
I need food.	Nze nneetaaga emmere.
I really didn’t care	Mazima ddala nnali sifaayo
But one has to move on.	Naye omuntu alina okugenda mu maaso.
That’s way too low.	Ekyo kiri wansi nnyo.
I'm going to talk.	Ngenda kwogera.
I just can’t believe it.	Nze sisobola kukkiriza kyokka.
And yet!.	Era naye!.
It was what he was doing, of course.	Kyali kye yali akola, ddala.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo.
You have to talk to him.	Olina okwogera naye.
He is not like us.	Tali nga ffe.
I’m afraid he did	Ntya nti yakikola
We can do a lot of those things.	Tusobola okukola ebintu bingi ebyo.
I could easily imagine that scenario	Nnali nsobola bulungi okulowooza ku mbeera eyo
It’s not just that.	Si ekyo kyokka.
She is my wife.	Ye mukyala wange.
Now if it isn’t.	Kati oba si bwe kiri.
I thought we could do it	Nalowooza nti tusobola okukikola
He had no idea what.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku ki.
But he spoke up.	Naye ye yayogera.
He came almost at the same time.	Yajja kumpi mu kiseera kye kimu.
I was there busy there for a while	Nali waliwo bbize eyo okumala akaseera
This is in theory.	Kino kiri mu ndowooza.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
He didn’t know if he had the time.	Yali tamanyi oba yalina obudde.
I can’t see the danger	Sisobola kulaba bulabe
I just want to know her husband	Njagala kumanya musajja we yekka
You go to work.	Ggwe ogenda ku mulimu.
In fact, he was.	Mu butuufu, yali...
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
That’s actually happening.	Ekyo mu butuufu kigenda mu maaso.
I need to know what’s going on	Nnina okumanya ekigenda mu maaso
And there we are there.	Era awo tuli awo.
I didn’t want to know.	Nnali saagala kumanya.
I have something to do right now	Nnina kye nkola mu kiseera kino
I would love to see that.	Njagala nnyo okulaba ekyo.
There is a house there to this day.	Waliwo ennyumba eyo n’okutuusa kati.
That was going to happen.	Ekyo kyali kigenda kubaawo.
I can't wait	Sisobola kulinda
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
He knew everything and everyone.	Yali amanyi buli kimu era buli muntu.
I knew it would be hard	Namanya nti kijja kuba kizibu
Everyone was coming.	Buli omu yali ajja.
I was here before.	Nze nali wano emabegako.
It was a beautiful room.	Kyali kisenge kirungi nnyo.
I hope you will answer my call.	Nsuubira nti ojja kuddamu essimu yange.
I don’t know why.	Nze simanyi lwaki.
And it is a daily task.	Era mulimu gwa buli lunaku.
No one likes this approach.	Tewali ayagala nkola eno.
I expected to know immediately.	Nnali nsuubira okumanya amangu ddala.
Glad you’re here.	Musanyufu nti oli wano.
Me, too, of course.	Nange, ddala.
I love his bottom.	Njagala nnyo wansi we.
That’s not a problem.	Ekyo si kizibu.
And this wasn’t it.	Era kino si kye kyali.
He obviously can’t.	Kya lwatu nti tasobola.
I always knew it	Bulijjo nnali nkimanyi
I knew this was going to happen	Namanya nti kino kyali kigenda kubaawo
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
No, that would have been yesterday.	Nedda, ekyo kyandibadde jjo.
It was probably true.	Oboolyawo kyali kituufu.
Someone has to do it.	Waliwo alina okukola.
I wanted the same thing	Nze nali njagala ekintu kye kimu
He knows that.	Ekyo akimanyi.
Really fast, really strong.	Ddala amangu, ddala amaanyi.
I can’t be everywhere and do everything quickly	Sisobola kubeera buli wamu ne nkola buli kimu mu bwangu
I have no idea what to do about that either	Ekyo nange sirina kirowoozo kya kukola ku nsonga eyo
Let me think for a moment.	Ka ndowooza okumala akaseera.
Something that is difficult.	Ekintu ekizibu.
I have it as it is	Nnina nga bwe kiri
I didn’t want to keep going	Nnali saagala kusigala nga ngenda mu maaso
This is a friend.	Guno mukwano.
I want this.	Kino njagala.
He thought he knew everything.	Yalowooza nti buli kimu akimanyi.
Now I don’t know what to say.	Kati simanyi kya kwogera.
I’m fine here.	Nze wano ndi bulungi.
I can’t do anything wrong	Sisobola kukola kintu kyonna kibi
He was a very good friend of mine.	Yali mukwano gwange mulungi nnyo.
I just couldn’t wait.	Nnali sisobola kulinda kyokka.
I may be back next weekend	Nnyinza okudda ku wiikendi ejja
He doesn’t even have a younger one.	Talina wadde muto.
I have a lot of these	Bino nnina bingi
I want to talk to you	Njagala kwogera naawe
It looks like it’s going to work well.	Kirabika kigenda kukola bulungi.
I want to be young again	Njagala kuddamu kubeera muto
But he can’t.	Naye tasobola.
At the time I thought it was fine	Mu kiseera ekyo nnalowooza nti kyali kirungi
If not me, the dog.	Bwe si nze, embwa.
I know that’s what you wanted	Nkimanyi nti ekyo kye wali oyagala
I wanted to talk to him.	Nnali njagala okwogera naye.
I know nothing about it	Tewali kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo
I have everything tonight	Nnina buli kimu ekiro kino
I was happy as can be	Nali musanyufu nga bwe kiyinza okuba
I don't care where.	Sifaayo wa.
I think that’s what he wants from you	Ndowooza ekyo ky’ayagala ku ggwe
I don’t have anyone in me at all	Sirina muntu mu nze n’akatono
I don’t know what to do with this.	Kino simanyi kye nnyinza kukola.
I do the very same thing	Nze kye kimu nnyo kye nkola
I want to be me again	Njagala kuddamu kubeera nze
Somewhere there there.	Waliwo awo eyo.
You're you.	Ggwe gwe.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
It’s just not good.	Si kirungi kyokka.
One problem at a time, he thought.	Ekizibu kimu ku kimu, bwe yalowooza.
But I feel like it is.	Naye mpulira nga bwe kiri.
Or if you would like to.	Oba oba wandyagadde.
I really didn’t want to answer	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kuddamu
I need to move on	Nze nneetaaga okugenda mu maaso
No, no, not us.	Nedda, nedda, si ffe.
We will be very close.	Tujja kuba kumpi nnyo.
No, he is my brother.	Nedda, ye muganda wange.
He was in school.	Yali mu ssomero.
I am ready to go with you but .	Ndi mwetegefu okugenda naawe naye .
As it was the case.	Nga bwe kyali.
I hope you really like it	Nsuubira nti ddala oyagala nnyo
I know that was quick	Nkimanyi nti ekyo kyali kya mangu
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
I didn’t know how much	Nze nnali simanyi bungi bwe bungi
I’m not sure what my father was doing	Sikakasa taata bwe yali akola
I want to have time to get to the answer	Njagala okufuna obudde okutuuka ku kuddamu
We have to think.	Tulina okulowooza.
He tried to eat.	Yagezaako okulya.
In that respect he was like me.	Mu nsonga eyo yali nga nze.
I should have been on time	Nnali nsaanidde okutuuka mu budde
You don’t know.	Tomanyi ggwe.
He was a pleasure to work with	Yali musanyufu nnyo okukola naye
It’s going to be a good time.	Kigenda kuba kiseera kirungi.
I was actually planning on doing it tonight	Mu butuufu nnali nteekateeka kukikola ekiro kino
I should have gone home	Nnali nsaanidde okudda eka
I really want to be with you	Njagala kubeera naawe ddala
My brother has another one.	Muganda wange alina omulala.
I wonder if he is happy.	Nze nneebuuza oba musanyufu.
He says he doesn’t know.	Agamba nti tamanyi.
I can’t tell which one.	Sisobola kumanya ki.
I know what it’s like to be down here.	Nkimanyi bwe kiri okubeera wansi wano.
I definitely need to get a boyfriend	Mazima ddala nneetaaga okufuna muganzi
I want to be a good person.	Njagala kubeera muntu mulungi.
Which, in a sense, he did.	Ekyo, mu ngeri emu, kye yakola.
I was hoping for tomorrow night	Nali nsuubira enkya ekiro
He didn’t want any help.	Yali tayagala buyambi bwonna.
I want to be like him	Njagala kubeera nga ye
I didn’t know what to expect	Nnali simanyi kye nsuubira
I wanted a dog more than anything	Nnali njagala embwa okusinga ekintu kyonna
I hope you are good too.	Nsuubira nti naawe oli mulungi.
Now he had no choice in the matter.	Kati yali talina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
Will try that.	Ajja kugezaako ekyo.
I really didn’t want to	Mazima ddala nnali saagala
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
I want to be that person	Njagala kubeera muntu oyo
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
From every.	Okuva ku buli.
I’m going to keep going.	Ngenda kusigala nga ngenda mu maaso.
You seem to be a good person.	Olabika oli muntu mulungi.
I guess it doesn’t really matter	Ntebereza nti si kikulu nnyo
I can’t see anything at all it seems	Sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna n’akatono kirabika
The movie would have been great	Firimu yandibadde nnungi nnyo
I can't speak.	Siyinza kwogera.
I feel really happy	Mpulira ddala musanyufu
I knew you would like it	Namanya nti wandyagadde
That’s not the case in this film.	Ekyo si bwe kiri mu firimu eno.
It will work.	Kijja kukola.
I thought he wanted to talk too	Nalowooza nti naye ayagala kwogera
I can’t go to school today	Leero sisobola kugenda ku ssomero
I certainly knew where they were	Mazima ddala nnali mmanyi gye baali
I couldn’t believe it was him	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza nti ye ye
But he couldn’t go.	Naye yali tasobola kugenda.
I’m not one of them.	Nze siri omu.
I just want to talk to you	Njagala kwogera naawe kyokka
I could certainly do that	Mazima ddala ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola
That may have been a bad idea.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kyali kirowoozo kibi.
No, he has to go.	Nedda, alina okugenda.
I am that person.	Nze oyo omuntu.
He is very afraid.	Atya nnyo.
He would belong to this situation.	Yandibadde wa mbeera eno.
And it went away.	Era ne kigenda.
No one knew why.	Tewali yali amanyi lwaki.
I doubt he was headed there	Nbuusabuusa nti yali ayolekedde eyo
I can’t do much about anything	Sisobola kukola bingi ku kintu kyonna
He actually said that	Mu butuufu yayogera bw’atyo
I love reading now.	Njagala nnyo okusoma kati.
I like things my way	Njagala nnyo ebintu mu ngeri yange
Now they were face to face.	Kati baali maaso ku maaso.
I know for sure that everything is normal	Nkimanyi bulungi nti buli kimu kya bulijjo
I probably won’t	Oboolyawo sijja kukikola
I am you, of course	Nze ggwe, ddala
No, it’s much worse than that.	Nedda, kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I know that you know.	Nkimanyi nti omanyi.
You’re working on yourself.	Oba okola ku ggwe kennyini.
Where he was or was.	Gye yali oba gye yali.
It’s up to you, of course.	Kiri gy’oli, ddala.
He could do anything.	Yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
I knew what he was planning	Nnali mmanyi kye yali ateekateeka
I don’t know who it is	Simanyi ani
There really is.	Ddala waliwo.
I for one am happy.	Nze ku lwa omu ndi musanyufu.
He was in class alone.	Yali mu kibiina yekka.
are you? 	ye ggwe?
Everything is the same.	Buli kimu kiri kimu.
is everyone else? 	ye buli muntu omulala yenna?
No.	Nedda.
Attitude is a complex thing.	Endowooza kintu kizibu nnyo.
I couldn’t do that.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola.
I thought everything was fine	Nalowooza nti buli kimu kyali kirungi
I was with him about it	Nze nali naye ku nsonga eyo
Someone will know though.	Waliwo ajja kumanya wadde.
I have been in that position	Mbadde mu kifo ekyo
It was actually a pretty good movie.	Mu butuufu yali firimu nnungi nnyo.
I am this child.	Nze nali mwana oyo.
For me this was not the case.	Nze kino si bwe kyali.
You can have money too.	Naawe osobola okuba ne ssente.
But that doesn’t matter now.	Naye ekyo si kikulu kati.
I had no idea what he wanted	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku kye yali ayagala
I think there are many reasons why he did it	Ndowooza waliwo ensonga nnyingi lwaki yakikola
This is not an easy thing.	Kino si kintu kyangu.
I always have something to say	Bulijjo nnina kye njagala okwogera
I couldn’t even say anything.	Nnali sisobola kwogera wadde ekintu kyonna.
Or you don’t have one.	Oba tolina emu.
It was good, like a movie.	Kyali kirungi, nga firimu.
No one was in sight.	Tewali yali alabika.
He was the only one.	Ye yali yekka.
I couldn’t do anything.	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
I'm going in the week.	Ngenda mu wiiki.
He was apparently unhappy in his position at the time.	Kirabika yali si musanyufu mu kifo kye mu kiseera ekyo.
I don’t want anything.	Saagala kintu kyonna.
However, I may have	Kyokka, nnyinza okuba nga nnali nfunye
I wish we had it	Njagala nnyo nga bwe tulina
We will be going now.	Tujja kuba tugenda kati.
But we must act quickly.	Naye tulina okukola amangu.
He loved being in the classroom	Yali ayagala nnyo okubeera mu kibiina
This is fine for now.	Kino kirungi mu kiseera kino.
Where was it now?.	Kati kyali ludda wa?.
I knew nothing about the person	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku muntu oyo
This is a common problem.	Kino kizibu kya bulijjo.
I’m fine with this.	Nze kino ndi bulungi.
He then saw someone behind him.	Yalaba awo nga waliwo omuntu emabega we.
I want to be like you.	Njagala kubeera nga ggwe.
He needed a plan.	Yali yeetaaga enteekateeka.
I have a lot of things to do	Nnina ebintu bingi bye nnina okukola
But he wants to see my city.	Naye ayagala kulaba kibuga kyange.
I didn’t know what he was thinking	Nali simanyi kye yali alowooza
I think you have to tap on something.	Nze ndowooza nti olina okukuba ku kintu.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
That is the main problem.	Ekyo kye kikulu ekizibu.
This way, you move forward.	Mu ngeri eno, ogenda mu maaso.
And I think this is a great idea	Era ndowooza nti kino kirowoozo kirungi nnyo
Not everyone had access to everything.	Si buli muntu nti yali asobola okufuna buli kimu.
Maybe you’re not.	Mpozzi nga ggwe si bwe kiri.
I am nothing and he is everything.	Nze siri kintu era ye buli kimu.
This is actually happening.	Kino mu butuufu kigenda mu maaso.
I knew exactly what he was thinking	Nnali mmanyi bulungi kye yali alowooza
While he is.	Nga ye...
It looks much better now.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo kati.
No one said anything.	Tewali yayogera kintu kyonna.
I thought we had something	Nalowooza nti tulina kye tulina
I hope you will stay with us.	Nsuubira nti ojja kusigala naffe.
I don’t really know much about it.	Mu butuufu simanyi bingi ku nsonga eyo.
We have it easy.	Tulina kyangu.
Going a little further perhaps	Okugenda mu maaso katono mpozzi
I don’t know the date.	Simanyi lunaku.
I feel like everything is fine	Mpulira nga buli kimu kiri bulungi
I want your opinion on that.	Njagala endowooza yo ku ekyo.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si ekyo kyokka.
And it’s great to eat.	Era kirungi nnyo okulya.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
Not long now.	Si bbanga ddene kati.
I have no idea why he is here	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki ali wano
You won't go.	Tojja kugenda.
This is a bad thing.	Kino kibi.
He felt everything.	Yawulira buli kimu.
I think you can see that this is true	Ndowooza osobola okulaba nti kino kituufu
Everything like.	Buli kimu nga.
And faster, faster than he expected.	Era amangu, amangu okusinga bwe yali asuubira.
I was ready for this	Kino nnali mwetegefu
I loved that too.	Ekyo nange nnali njagala nnyo.
I’m not sure he knows what that is right now.	Sikakasa nti amanyi ekyo kye kiri mu kiseera kino.
That's that, he thought.	Ekyo kye ekyo, bwe yalowooza.
We have just about everything.	Tulina kumpi buli kimu kyokka.
I didn’t know you had it in you	Nnali simanyi nti olina mu ggwe
It’s not a group.	Si kibiina.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
Then we have the.	Awo tulina ne...
But he would work.	Naye yandikoze.
You should have known better.	Wandibadde omanyi bulungi.
And it can be very difficult.	Era kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
We’ll drive.	Tujja kuvuga.
It’s probably on mine.	Oboolyawo kiri ku kyange.
I had absolutely no idea what he was on about	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi n’akatono ku kiki kye yali ku
I didn’t want to be completely alone	Nnali saagala kubeera nzekka ddala
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
I wanted to be with my wife	Nnali njagala kubeera ne mukyala wange
I thought it was great	Nalowooza nti kirungi nnyo
As shown below.	Nga bwe kiri wansi.
We don’t have the money.	Tetulina ssente.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
The moment itself.	Akaseera kennyini.
Morning.	Ku makya.
He came to me.	Yajja gye ndi.
They are not though.	Si bwe bali wadde.
Everything is fine with me.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi gyendi.
To everyone.	Eri buli omu.
And he knew what he had to do.	Era yali amanyi ky’alina okukola.
I thought it was great	Nalowooza nti kyali kirungi nnyo
But he has it.	Naye alina.
And it’s nothing serious.	Era si kintu kya maanyi.
I just want one thing.	Nze ekintu kimu kyokka kye njagala.
Apparently we’re not the only ones.	Kirabika si ffe ffekka.
I hope you will agree	Nsuubira nti ojja kukkiriza
I’ve always loved it	Njagala nnyo bulijjo
Difficult, to say the least.	Kizibu, okugamba nti.
We can always do the work.	Bulijjo tusobola okukola omulimu.
They were now.	Baali kati.
My wife doesn’t want a child.	Mukyala wange tayagala mwana.
He wants his son.	Ayagala mwana we.
You can do it better.	Osobola okukikola obulungi.
And we need help.	Era twetaaga obuyambi.
I just didn’t want to talk	Nze nnali saagala kwogera kyokka
However, I won’t.	Kyokka, sijja kukikola.
I hope this comes up in my work	Nsuubira kino kijja kujja mu mulimu gwange
But this is not a logical issue.	Naye eno si nsonga ya nsonga.
I thought it would be awkward but it wasn’t	Nalowooza nti kijja kuba kizibu naye si bwe kyali
You can’t make more time.	Tosobola kukola budde bungi.
You are watching a movie.	Oli mu kulaba firimu.
I am truly blessed to be here	Nfunye omukisa mu mazima okubeera wano
Is that okay?.	Ekyo kiri bulungi?.
I was almost certain	Nali kumpi nkakasa nti
I need to be doing something	Nze nneetaaga okuba nga nnina kye nkola
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
I think he was really into his brother	Ndowooza ddala yali mu muganda we
A little bit there.	Katono awo.
I'm always me.	Bulijjo nze nze.
There I was safe.	Eyo gye nnali sirina bulabe.
Everything will be easier that way.	Buli kimu kijja kuba kyangu mu ngeri eyo.
I hope that happens soon	Nsuubira nti ekyo kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono
I was almost afraid to do it	Nali kumpi ntya okukikola
No one knows everything.	Tewali amanyi buli kimu.
I wasn’t sure if you could do it	Nali sikakasa oba osobola okukikola
I want to go home too	Nange njagala kudda waka
I was as happy as I could be	Nali musanyufu nga bwe nsobola okuba
I know you can do it better	Nkimanyi nti osobola okukikola obulungi
I still can’t quite believe it myself	Nze kennyini n’okutuusa kati sisobola bulungi kukkiriza
That’s what we have now.	Ekyo kye tulina kati.
I'm going home about now	Ngenda waka nga kati
He says we need to talk.	Agamba nti twetaaga okwogera.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
That’s what I want.	Ekyo njagala.
And to speak.	Era okwogera.
I needed to go with him	Nnali nneetaaga okugenda naye
I like to be alone	Njagala nnyo okubeera nzekka
But now he knew better.	Naye kati yali amanyi bulungi.
He felt very much.	Yawulira nnyo.
The food is excellent.	Emmere nnungi nnyo.
That’s easy.	Ekyo kyangu.
I didn’t even know how	Nnali simanyi na ngeri ya kukola
I just needed to know	Nnali nneetaaga kumanya kyokka
I don’t know if you know that.	Simanyi oba ekyo okimanyi.
I can come back tomorrow to talk to him	Nsobola okudda enkya okwogera naye
I don’t have any friends.	Nze sirina mikwano.
I’m in this.	Nze ndi mu kino.
You have to go.	Olina okugenda.
I could do that	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola
But not much.	Naye si bingi.
And in the future.	Era mu maaso.
It might, he thought.	Kiyinza, bwe yalowooza.
That’s just dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe kyokka.
He won’t allow it to happen.	Tajja kukkiriza kubeerawo.
I could hardly get an appetite	Nnali sisobola kufuna nnyo njagala ya kulya
But he looks dangerous to me.	Naye alabika nga wa bulabe gyendi.
As it was before.	Nga bwe kyali emabegako.
I wanted and needed help	Nnali njagala era nga nneetaaga obuyambi
I’m not good at waiting.	Siri mulungi mu kulinda.
But he had it.	Naye yalina.
It is a very good idea.	Kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
Not exactly well.	Si ddala bulungi.
He always, it seemed to me, had his way.	Bulijjo, kyali kirabika gyendi, yalina engeri ye.
I wanted to be human	Nnali njagala kubeera muntu
I have to think ahead	Nnina okulowooza mu maaso
I am well aware of that.	Nze ekyo nkimanyi bulungi.
It was really really great.	Ddala ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
I know more than you do	Nze mmanyi bingi okusinga ggwe
I know you can do it	Nkimanyi nti osobola okukikola
It was bad for a long time	Kyali kibi okumala ebbanga ddene
That feels awful to me	Ekyo mpulira nga kibi nnyo
Maybe he’s the one.	Mpozzi nga y’ali.
And he's like.	Era ye nga.
I have no faith, as well.	Sirina kukkiriza, nga bwe kiri.
He is a playful character.	Ye muzannyi wa kuzannya.
I think that’s a good thing.	Ndowooza ekyo kintu kirungi.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
I’m an ordinary man, just like you	Nze ndi musajja wa bulijjo, nga ggwe
He wanted there.	Yali ayagala eyo.
I need to know he is safe	Nnina okumanya nti talina bulabe
I could barely see.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kulaba.
I was sure it was there.	Nali nkakasa nti kyali awo.
No one said it was easy.	Tewali yagamba nti kyangu.
I will not stay in this house.	Sijja kusigala mu nnyumba eno.
As he would have with her.	Nga bwe yandibadde naye.
Perhaps that was why he was afraid.	Oboolyawo y’ensonga lwaki yali atya.
He knew better than to answer.	Yali amanyi bulungi okusinga okuddamu.
I'm going home.	Ngenda eka.
I just needed to wait	Nnali nneetaaga kulinda kyokka
I have no idea about that	Ekyo sirina kye mmanyi
I wondered what he was doing	Nneebuuza kye yali akola
I thought that would never happen	Nnalowooza nti ekyo tekijja kubaawo
It was something.	Yali kintu.
Everything was bad	Buli kimu kyali kibi
I can’t answer right now	Sisobola kuddamu mu kiseera kino
No, it’s not a car.	Nedda, si mmotoka.
However, there is nothing to do.	Kyokka, tewali kya kukola.
All she wanted was home.	Kye yali ayagala kyali waka.
I don’t care	Sifaayo
This movie is great.	Firimu eno nnungi nnyo.
I said if he had.	Nagamba nti oba yalina.
That would be easy.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu.
And it’s best to do it from that perspective.	Era kirungi okukikola okuva mu ndowooza eyo.
There is nothing ordinary about this.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo mu kino.
I was really busy too	Ddala nange nnali bbize
I wanted to know what he was thinking	Nnali njagala okumanya kye yali alowooza
No one did anything.	Tewali yakola kintu kyonna.
We need to get out of here, now.	Twetaaga okuva wano, kati.
He could do that.	Ekyo yali asobola okukikola.
I won’t be able to live with myself	Sijja kusobola kubeera nange kennyini
We have to move forward.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso.
The problem is not.	Obuzibu si bwe kiri.
I have to go immediately	Nnina okugenda amangu ddala
Although he shouldn’t.	Wadde nga tasaanidde kukikola.
That’s all there is to it.	Ekyo kye kyokka.
I know he won’t be here tonight	Nkimanyi nti tajja kubeera wano ekiro kino
We don’t even have to stay.	Tetulina na kusigala.
It’s not likely, or will be, but it is.	Si kiyinza okuba, oba kijja kuba, naye kiri.
Today.	Leero.
Not all of it all.	Si byonna byonna.
I could go on and on about this.	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu maaso ku kino.
I belonged there of course.	Nze nnali wa eyo ddala.
I know that, too.	Ekyo nange nkimanyi.
Everyone agreed.	Buli omu yakkiriza.
I have to think fast	Nnina okulowooza amangu
This is not an all-or-nothing problem.	Kino si kizibu kya byonna oba tewali.
And, it’s very important.	Era, kikulu nnyo.
I knew dinner would be soon	Namanya nti ekyeggulo kijja kuba mu bbanga ttono
I just know, together, we’ll be fine	Nze mmanyi kyokka, nga tuli wamu, tujja kuba bulungi
I knew exactly where he would be	Nali mmanyi bulungi gye yandibadde
All for one person.	Byonna lwa muntu omu.
But that’s not the point, he continued.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga, bwe yagenda mu maaso.
He's sick, too.	Ye mulwadde, naye.
Maybe it’s you.	Mpozzi nga ggwe.
I can’t deal with a child	Sisobola kukola ku mwana
He is asleep now.	Yeebase kati.
I know you won’t know	Nkimanyi nti tojja kumanya
Anything can happen here.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo wano.
He was ready.	Yali mwetegefu.
I was wondering that myself	Ekyo nze kennyini nnali nneebuuza
I'm not sure what the answer is yet though.	Sikakasa kya kuddamu ki n'okutuusa kati wadde.
Everyone wanted to talk to him.	Buli omu yali ayagala okwogera naye.
He knows he isn’t.	Akimanyi nti si bw’atyo.
It’s really a one-or-none approach.	Ddala nkola ya kimu oba tewali.
I want to talk to you	Njagala kwogera naawe
This is not a practical approach.	Eno si nkola ya nkola.
I hope it's not too bad for you	Nsuubira nti si kibi nnyo gy'oli
It could be me.	Kiyinza okuba nze.
This was excellent.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
I guess that’s why they’re so low.	Ntebereza y’ensonga lwaki bali wansi nnyo.
I can’t do it.	Siyinza kukikola.
I think it looks great	Ndowooza kirabika bulungi nnyo
I was too young at the time to know how.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali muto nnyo nga sisobola kumanya ngeri gye nkola.
That’s all there is to it.	Ekyo kyokka kye kiri.
I didn’t have time for this	Kino nnali sirina budde
I can do that from here	Ekyo nsobola okukikola okuva wano
Very happy, actually.	Musanyufu nnyo, mu butuufu.
I couldn’t believe his opinion	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza ndowooza ye
You know what they were.	Omanyi kye baali.
I'm sure he'd rather not	Nkakasa nti yandibadde asinga obutakola
I can’t quite do it myself	Nze kennyini sisobola bulungi
He doesn’t have anyone.	Talina muntu yenna.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I don't know where the problem is, everything seems fine.	Simanyi buzibu gye buli, buli kimu kirabika kiri bulungi.
There is no acting here.	Tewali kuzannya wano.
I know it’s great.	Nkimanyi nti kirungi nnyo.
I wonder how long he's been here	Nze nneebuuza nti amaze wano ebbanga ki
I knew he wanted to say something.	Namanya nti alina ky’ayagala okwogera.
One has everything one needs	Omuntu alina buli kimu kye yeetaaga
I know you won’t do anything about it	Nkimanyi nti tojja kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo
Why or why not.	Lwaki oba lwaki nedda.
I know it doesn’t really matter	Nkimanyi nti mu butuufu si kikulu
It’s a lot of money	Ssente nnyingi nnyo
However, I can get to ride there.	Kyokka nsobola okufuna okuvuga eyo.
I want to talk to you a bit	Njagala kwogera naawe katono
It’s not a good practice.	Si nkola nnungi.
I needed someone to go with me.	Nnali nneetaaga omuntu agenda nange.
He was her friend.	Yali mukwano gwe.
I can’t find the truth	Sisobola kufuna mazima
That’s not who we are.	Ekyo si kye tuli.
I knew why he was here	Namanya lwaki yali wano
We have one guy.	Tulina ggaayi omu.
I think he's coming down.	Ndowooza ajja wansi.
He couldn't stay here now.	Yali tasobola kusigala wano kati.
He had to do it.	Yalina okukikola.
The view from there.	Okulaba okuva awo.
I feel so much better now	Mpulira bulungi nnyo kati
We have to do this now.	Kino tulina okukikola kati.
This is what it is.	Kino kye kiri.
But this is not an issue.	Naye kino si nsonga.
It’s not a job or a job.	Si mulimu oba omulimu.
It is so much with you.	Kiri bingi nnyo naawe.
I’m sure it will help	Nkakasa nti kijja kuyamba
That doesn’t matter to me.	Ekyo si kikulu gyendi.
And better there than here with us.	Era kirungi awo okusinga wano naffe.
However, not with this.	Kyokka si na kino.
It’s not necessarily for good.	Si kituufu nti kya bulungi.
This will be good.	Kino kijja kuba kirungi.
I couldn’t live with myself	Nnali sisobola kubeera nange kennyini
But he was afraid.	Naye yali atya.
What he expected, he thought.	Kye yali asuubira, bwe yalowooza.
In fact, you should.	Mu butuufu, olina okukikola.
He wants a job for a job.	Ayagala mulimu gwa mulimu.
In any case.	Mu mbeera yonna.
He won’t tell anyone.	Tajja kubuulira muntu yenna.
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
It was intense, as he knew it would be.	Kyali kya maanyi, nga bwe yali amanyi nti kijja kuba.
I know it can be hard	Nkimanyi nti kiyinza okuba ekizibu
They were everywhere.	Baali buli wamu.
We can’t answer.	Tetusobola kuddamu.
I was a child.	Nze nali mwana.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
He might have been happy.	Yandiba nga yali musanyufu.
I know what he wants	Nze mmanyi ky’ayagala
I knew he would like that	Nnali nkimanyi nti ekyo yandiyagadde
I ask nothing in return	Tewali kye nsaba mu kuddamu
No, it’s not the same.	Nedda, si kye kimu.
I needed to be alone	Nnali nneetaaga okubeera nzekka
I am a man like you	Nange ndi musajja nga ggwe
He actually started doing that.	Mu butuufu yatandika okukola ekyo.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I hope it continues.	Nsuubira nti kigenda mu maaso.
My house was beautiful.	Ennyumba yange yali nnungi.
I know you are very strong	Nkimanyi nti oli wa maanyi nnyo
In fact it was.	Mu butuufu bwe kyali.
And, well.	Era, bulungi.
It’s really nice.	Kirungi ddala.
And there’s a reason why.	Era waliwo ensonga lwaki.
He had an opinion.	Yalina endowooza.
He should have known.	Yandibadde amanyi.
It’s not too early.	Si bukyali nnyo.
Probably that, he thought.	Oboolyawo ekyo, bwe yalowooza.
Like that one tonight.	Nga oyo ekiro kino.
I was perfectly fine by myself	Nali bulungi ddala nzekka
I didn’t know how sick I was	Nze nali simanyi ngeri gye nnali mulwadde
I think this could work well	Ndowooza kino kiyinza okukola obulungi
Not everyone wants to do that.	Ekyo si buli muntu nti ayagala kukikola.
I couldn’t see anyone	Nnali sisobola kulaba muntu yenna
Perhaps it was the dog.	Oboolyawo ye yali embwa.
That, it is.	Ekyo, bwe kiri.
I can’t go right now	Sisobola kugenda mu kiseera kino
I don’t want to be where he lived	Saagala kubeera gye yali abeera
I wish he was still here	Njagala yandibadde akyali wano
Make.	Okukola.
I can do it better than you.	Nsobola okukikola okusinga ggwe.
I know what kind of person you are	Nze mmanyi omuntu wa ngeri ki gy’oli
I’m willing to do it.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukikola.
I don’t know who did it.	Simanyi ani yakikola.
I am truly sorry for your car	Mazima ddala nsonyiwa mmotoka yo
I always hoped to have me.	Bulijjo nnali nsuubira okuba nange.
It’s going to be fine.	Kigenda kuba bulungi.
But that wasn’t the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kyali.
I am completely happy at home	Ndi musanyufu ddala awaka
No one would know.	Tewali yandibadde amanyi.
You're me.	Ggwe nze.
I knew better than to answer	Nnali mmanyi okusinga okuddamu
That’s not what they were.	Ekyo si kye baali.
We have to do this.	Kino tulina okukikola.
I will be there all weekend	Nja kubeerawo wiikendi yonna
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
I don’t think you can do that.	Sirowooza nti ekyo osobola okukikola.
Nobody wants anything.	Tewali ayagala kintu kyonna.
It was very dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
She was a lucky woman.	Yali mukyala wa mukisa.
Or you may know where it’s going, but not where it is.	Oba oyinza okumanya gye kigenda, naye si gye kiri.
And it is the time.	Era kye kiseera.
He would be terrified.	Yandibadde atya nnyo.
I didn’t think that was the reason at all	Nnali sirowooza nti eyo y’ensonga lwaki n’akatono
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
I hear, and I hear, and I hear.	Mpulira, era mpulira, era mpulira.
It’s not really dangerous.	Si kya bulabe ddala.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He did very well.	Yakola bulungi nnyo.
And then, baby .	Era awo, mwana wange .
Back to work today.	Okudda ku mulimu leero.
I need a plan.	Nze nneetaaga enteekateeka.
Everyone wants to do that.	Buli muntu ayagala okukola ekyo.
I need someone.	Nze nneetaaga omuntu.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
I thought about everything	Nalowooza ku buli kimu
I feel that nothing will happen tonight, but very soon	Mpulira nti tewali kijja kubaawo ekiro kino, naye mu bbanga ttono ddala
Not that it really matters.	Si nti ddala kikulu.
He can't speak.	Tasobola kwogera.
I want to know why he left	Njagala kumanya lwaki yagenda
I won’t tell anyone.	Sijja kubuulira muntu yenna.
I actually wanted him to work	Mu butuufu nnali njagala akole
And maybe.	Era mpozzi.
From the point of view.	Okuva ku nsonga.
Forward.	Mu maaso.
I was working at the time too	Nange nnali nkola mu kiseera ekyo
I always knew when it was you	Bulijjo nnali mmanyi ddi lwe wali ggwe
He is the best.	Ye asinga obulungi.
I knew it was a problem	Namanya nti buzibu
He was strong.	Yali wa maanyi.
I had no idea that was his office.	Nali simanyi nti eyo ye ofiisi ye.
That’s not entirely true.	Ekyo si kituufu ddala.
It might just happen.	Kiyinza okumala okubaawo.
I know you can and you will have to	Nkimanyi nti osobola era ojja kuba olina
I'm not even sure they are	Sikakasa na nti bwe bali
But it looked good.	Naye nga kirabika bulungi.
Obviously, this is both a good and a bad thing.	Kya lwatu nti kino kintu kirungi era kibi.
She is.	Ye ali.
The person is dangerous.	Omuntu wa bulabe.
You have an opinion.	Ggwe olina endowooza.
I have to go to work tomorrow	Nnina okugenda ku mulimu enkya
Back to the front.	Okudda mu maaso.
I doubt we will	Nbuusabuusa nti tujja kukikola
I will certainly do that.	Mazima ddala ekyo nja kukikola.
I didn’t have any space	Nnali sirina kifo kyonna
I have a lot of money	Nnina ssente nnyingi
No, no, no, no.	Nedda nedda nedda nedda.
I was truly alone now	Mazima ddala kati nnali nzekka
I love dogs too.	Nange njagala nnyo embwa.
I am well aware of that.	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi.
And that will continue to be the case.	Era ekyo kijja kusigala nga bwe kiri.
I really wanted to be	Nnali njagala nnyo okubeera
There is power.	Waliwo amaanyi.
I knew it was coming	Namanya nti kijja
That, of course, was pretty bad.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kyali kibi nnyo.
Nice guy, nice guy	Ggaayi omulungi, ggaayi omulungi
Everybody knows everybody here.	Buli muntu amanyi buli muntu wano.
He was doing his job.	Yali akola omulimu gwe.
This can happen for three reasons.	Kino kiyinza okubaawo ensonga ssatu.
Can't you?.	Tosobola?.
I don’t want one to be you	Saagala omu kubeera ggwe
I needed to know that was all	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya nti ekyo kyokka
He will love everyone.	Ajja kwagala buli muntu.
Someone is like that like that.	Omuntu bw’atyo bw’atyo.
We were both.	Ffembi twali...
I wasn’t going to do it	Nze nali sigenda kukikola
I like it simple.	Njagala nnyo kyangu.
Same thing at home.	Ekintu kye kimu awaka.
I have high hopes though	Nnina essuubi ddene wadde
I didn’t have one for anything	Nnali sirina emu ku kintu kyonna
I want to see who it is	Njagala kulaba ani
I was actually happy	Mu butuufu nnali musanyufu
Done.	Okumala.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
I didn’t think it would happen	Nnali sirowooza nti kijja kubaawo
I knew what he was trying to say	Namanya kye yali agezaako okwogera
It’s not his office.	Si ofiisi ye.
I wasn’t sure if you were real	Nali sikakasa oba oli wa ddala
I loved it though	Nnali njagala nnyo wadde
I knew you would.	Nnali mmanyi nti ojja kukikola.
The movie was great.	Firimu yali nnungi nnyo.
I thought that was pretty normal	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyali kya bulijjo nnyo
This does not seem to be the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
This is actually a very common practice.	Kino mu butuufu nkola ya bulijjo nnyo.
I have no idea what to do now	Sirina kirowoozo kya kukola kati
I was so scared	Nnali ntya nnyo
I don’t care either.	Nze nange sirina kikulu kye nkola.
They certainly are.	Mazima ddala bwe bali.
He couldn’t believe how easy it was.	Yali tayinza kukkiriza ngeri gye kyali kyangu.
I was with him.	Nze nnali naye.
Like something.	Nga ekintu.
I need to move on from this	Kino nneetaaga okugenda mu maaso
It was for his brother, too.	Kyali kya muganda we, naye.
He could do that any time he wanted.	Ekyo yali asobola okukikola essaawa yonna gye yali ayagala.
I have nowhere to live	Sirina we nnyinza kubeera
I was powerless and alone	Nnali sirina maanyi era nnali nzekka
He needed to eat more.	Yali yeetaaga okulya ennyo.
You can do whatever you want.	Oyinza okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
I wasn’t going to do it now	Nze nali sigenda kukikola kati
I can’t do this again	Kino sisobola kuddamu kukikola
It was a sin.	Kyali kibi.
That is the whole problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyonna.
I actually feel better	Mu butuufu mpulira bulungi
And there’s me.	Era waliwo nze.
I love to drive.	Njagala nnyo okuvuga.
We were downstairs.	Twali wansi.
But this was going much better than he expected.	Naye kino kyali kigenda bulungi nnyo okusinga bwe yali asuubira.
Not here, not for her .	Si wano, si lwa ye .
Here I was ready	Wano nnali mwetegefu
It looks really good.	Kirabika bulungi ddala.
But now that’s fine.	Naye kati ekyo kirungi.
He came himself.	Yajja ye kennyini.
I thought that was a good thing.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kintu kirungi.
But he would like it now.	Naye yandiyagadde kati.
He needed time to think.	Yali yeetaaga obudde okulowooza.
He won’t be young.	Tajja kuba muto.
I could work from home	Nnali nsobola okukola nga ndi waka
I have no idea what time it is	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ssaawa mmeka
Indeed, that is true.	Mazima ddala, ekyo kituufu.
For my brother’s sake.	Ku lwa muganda wange.
I really wanted to, but I couldn’t	Nnali njagala nnyo naye nga sisobola
This is a bad thing.	Kino kibi.
I don’t care what city this is	Sifaayo ku kibuga ki kino
That’s what you really want.	Ekyo ggwe oyagala nnyo.
I think this is important.	Ndowooza kino kikulu.
I think that down.	Ndowooza nti wansi.
He knew how good she was.	Yali amanyi engeri gye yali omulungi.
I’m alone, but that’s fine	Nze ndi nzekka naye ekyo kirungi
I was thinking about money.	Nali ndowooza ku ssente.
But it’s really much more complicated than that.	Naye ddala kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He couldn't answer though.	Yali tasobola kuddamu wadde.
I think too many.	Ndowooza bingi nnyo.
This wasn’t it, there was nothing here that she needed.	Kino si kye kyali, wano tewali kye yali yeetaaga.
I thought you knew that	Nnalowooza nti ekyo okimanyi
I had nothing.	Nnali sirina kintu kyonna.
I’m working on mine	Nze nkola ku yange
I want to be in that.	Njagala kubeera mu ekyo.
He wasn’t happy.	Yali si musanyufu.
It’s a dangerous job.	Omulimu gwa bulabe.
I knew nothing better than you.	Nze nali sirina kye mmanyi okusinga ggwe.
Issue.	Ensonga.
We have to do it again soon.	Tulina okuddamu okukikola mu bbanga ttono.
I thought you wanted that on me.	Nalowooza nti ekyo oyagala ku nze.
I thought about it a lot	Nalowooza nnyo ku nsonga eyo
He is happy every day.	Ye musanyufu buli lunaku.
I couldn’t see what it was, yet	Nnali sisobola kulaba kye kyali, n’okutuusa kati
He didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala.
I really wanted to go home	Nnali njagala nnyo okudda eka
Here is one in here.	Wano waliwo omu mu wano.
It's bad bad bad.	Kibi kibi kibi.
We have to be here.	Tulina okubeera wano.
I want to know if they are okay	Njagala okumanya oba bali bulungi
But for each of us.	Naye eri buli omu ku ffe.
I really didn’t know what to expect.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kye nnali nsuubira.
I know happy he might have been	Nkimanyi musanyufu yandiba nga yali
No time for that now.	Tewali budde bwa ekyo kati.
He was young, but not young young.	Yali muto, naye nga si muto muto.
I wanted to see my dad	Nnali njagala kulaba taata wange
I have no domestic help.	Sirina buyambi bwa waka.
This was not the case.	Kino si bwe kyali.
Everyone looked so normal.	Buli omu yalabika nga wa bulijjo nnyo.
I’m the other one.	Nze omulala.
Now he was here.	Kati yali wano.
It was a difficult and difficult time.	Kyali kiseera kizibu era kizibu.
I have a lot of things about me	Nnina ebintu bingi ku nze
Can anyone know anything?.	Omuntu asobola okumanya ekintu kyonna?.
He said he had it in his room.	Yagambye nti yalina mu kisenge kye.
I wanted to see her beautiful bottom	Nnali njagala okulaba wansi we omulungi
There is nothing wrong with this.	Kino tewali kibi kyonna.
I have my own plan	Nnina enteekateeka yange
I didn’t want to go anywhere	Nnali saagala kugenda yonna
I know how to do that	Ekyo nkimanyi okukikola
I am everything.	Nze buli kimu.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
I wasn’t sure if it was for the better or the worse	Nali sikakasa oba kyali kya bulungi oba kibi
Like that was going to happen.	Nga ekyo bwe kyali kigenda okubaawo.
You would have to be there.	Wandibadde olina okuba nga oli awo.
And why? 	Era lwaki?
He seemed to always have.	Yalabika nga bulijjo alina.
I love about these when nothing is happening	Njagala nnyo ku bino nga tewali kigenda mu maaso
He could do that.	Ekyo yali asobola okukola.
I guess you can’t talk	Ntebereza nti tosobola kwogera
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
I’m here to help.	Nze ndi wano okuyamba.
I thought he would come back with her	Nalowooza nti ajja kudda naye
I didn’t know what he was thinking	Nnali simanyi kye yali alowooza
Too soon, he thought.	Mangu nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
We can do better.	Tusobola okukola obulungi.
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
I have no idea what he was thinking	Sirina kye mmanyi kye yali alowooza
Mostly just me.	Okusinga nze nzekka.
Obviously, it is.	Kya lwatu nti bwe kiri.
Now you have nothing.	Kati tolina kintu kyonna.
I wasn’t doing anything wrong	Nnali sirina kibi kye nkola
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
That’s where he was.	Awo we yali.
They were both fine.	Bombi baali bulungi.
He is probably a really good man.	Oboolyawo musajja mulungi ddala.
I thought he would always be there	Nalowooza nti bulijjo ajja kubeerawo
I wanted anything with you	Nnali njagala kintu kyonna naawe
She is not my wife.	Si ye mukyala wange.
I couldn’t talk to anyone	Nnali sisobola kwogera na muntu yenna
I was too nervous to do it	Nali ntya nnyo okukikola
Nothing was too much trouble.	Tewali kyali kizibu nnyo.
But not all the time.	Naye si buli kiseera.
He thought it wasn’t.	Yalowooza nti si bwe kiri.
And something is happening.	Era waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
That’s what he needed to do.	Ekyo kye yali yeetaaga okukola.
This is what he could do.	Kino kye yali asobola okukola.
Maybe he should have.	Mpozzi yalina okuba nga yalina.
I think you have to move on.	Ndowooza olina okugenda mu maaso.
It won’t be nearly easy.	Tekijja kuba kumpi na kyangu.
It is your opinion.	Ye ndowooza yo.
I was so happy to go.	Nali musanyufu nnyo okugenda.
There is no issue here.	Wano tewali nsonga yonna.
I wish he would but he isn’t	Njagala yandibadde naye si bwe kiri
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu nga ekyo.
I want to talk all night	Njagala kwogera ekiro kyonna
I have an opinion, but that is all	Nnina endowooza, naye ekyo kyokka kye kiri
He thought carefully about it.	Yalowooza bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
But now it won’t last long.	Naye kati tekijja kumala bbanga ddene.
But not this thing.	Naye si kintu kino.
I was probably the only normal friend he had	Oboolyawo nze nzekka mukwano gwa bulijjo gwe yalina
I won’t even try	Sijja na kugezaako
I live to work.	Nze mbeera okukola.
Even now he was dealing with the issue.	Ne kati yali akola ku nsonga.
I was afraid of what he would do	Nali ntya kye yandikoze
You might see something you like.	Oyinza okulaba ekintu ky’oyagala.
I like to talk about my watch.	Njagala nnyo okwogera ku ssaawa yange.
I hope not his brother	Nsuubira si muganda we
We’ll stay here.	Tujja kusigala wano.
It was definitely a matter of time.	Mazima ddala yali nsonga ya kiseera ekyo.
I just couldn’t believe this	Kino nnali sisobola kukkiriza kyokka
He does it well and looks happy.	Akikola bulungi era alabika nga musanyufu.
No one is here, either.	Tewali muntu yenna ali wano, era.
It’s not just you.	Si ggwe kyokka.
. . . .	.
I need to do that now	Ekyo nneetaaga okukikola kati
I'll wait here for an hour	Nja kulinda wano okumala essaawa emu
It looks good right now.	Kirabika bulungi mu kiseera kino.
I may have to do something about that	Ekyo nnyinza okuba nga nnina kye nnina okukola ku nsonga eyo
I have been thinking about this a lot.	Kino mbadde ndowooza nnyo ku nsonga eno.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
And you know, everything for a reason.	Era omanyi, buli kimu lwa nsonga.
But it was dangerous.	Naye nga kya bulabe.
That’s what he needed.	Ekyo yali yeetaaga.
I wondered why though.	Naye ne nneebuuza lwaki wadde.
I’ll come to you.	Nja kujja gy’oli.
He loves it so much.	Ayagala nnyo.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri bwe kiri.
Down to him.	Wansi ku ye.
Perhaps it is true.	Oboolyawo kituufu.
I was hoping that would be it, but it wasn’t	Nnali nsuubira nti ekyo kye kyandibadde, naye si bwe kyali
I will definitely do it again	Mazima ddala nja kuddamu okukikola
I'll be back in just a bit.	Nja kudda mu katono ddala.
But not much help.	Naye si buyambi bungi.
But even then there is a problem.	Naye ne mu kiseera ekyo waliwo ekizibu.
He felt very sleepy.	Yawulira nga yeebase nnyo.
This does not seem to be the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
He always speaks.	Bulijjo ayogera.
We are moving forward.	Tugenda mu maaso.
It won’t last long.	Tekijja kumala bbanga ddene.
You don’t have to say anything.	Tolina kwogera kintu kyonna.
He didn’t have to do that.	Ekyo yali talina kukikola.
He didn’t even know how to do it.	Yali tamanyi na kukikola.
Nothing serious, serious.	Tewali kintu kikulu, kikulu.
I just live to respond to you.	Nze mbeera okuddamu gy’oli kyokka.
My father went away.	Taata yagenda.
But above all he was a good man.	Naye okusinga byonna yali muntu mulungi.
You can drive.	Osobola okuvuga.
There is little hope this way.	Waliwo essuubi ttono mu ngeri eno.
There is no one there.	Tewali muntu yenna awo.
You don’t have to be here.	Tolina kubeera wano.
We need it so much.	Twetaaga nnyo.
I’m too young to be doing this.	Nze ndi muto nnyo okubeera nga nkola kino.
He wants to talk.	Ayagala kwogera.
I have to get to work.	Nnina okutuuka ku mulimu.
That’s how I want it.	Bw’atyo bwe kiri kye njagala.
But now, here it was.	Naye kati, wano we kyali.
He said it wasn’t bad.	Yagambye nti si kibi.
But we cannot know for sure.	Naye tetusobola kumanya bulungi.
And how important that is.	Era ekyo nga kikulu nnyo.
I was a little nervous about this.	Kino nnali ntya katono.
. . . .	.
They are in this room, tonight.	Bali mu kisenge kino, ekiro kino.
Anyone could do anything.	Omuntu yenna yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
I think that’s a good idea.	Ndowooza ekyo kirowoozo kirungi.
To be capable of this.	Okubeera nga asobola kino.
Maybe a week in either direction.	Mpozzi wiiki emu mu buli ludda.
I am a human being.	Nze ndi muntu.
He said he would be right back, though.	Yagamba nti ajja kudda amangu ddala, wadde.
He wants to work.	Ayagala okukola.
I have to do it.	Nnina okukikola.
I have no idea, really	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna, ddala
I can do it.	Nsobola okukikola.
I’m not sure you will.	Sikakasa nti ojja kukikola.
I can’t go back to work yet	Sisobola kudda ku mulimu n’okutuusa kati
I just love it so much	Nze njagala nnyo kyokka
You don’t have to do that.	Ekyo tolina kukikola.
I can’t talk to him at all	Sisobola kwogera naye n’akatono
That’s good to know.	Ekyo kirungi okumanya.
It was a party or something.	Yali mbaga oba ekintu kyonna.
No, it’s not good.	Nedda, si kirungi.
Maybe he and she .	Mpozzi ye ne ye .
He thought that was it.	Yalowooza nti ekyo kye kyali.
That was, well, not the case.	Ekyo kyali, bulungi, si bwe kyali.
Everything was down.	Buli kimu kyali wansi.
She will never be a woman again.	Tajja kuddamu kubeera mukyala.
It was really quite simple.	Ddala kyali kyangu nnyo.
How fast he is.	Nga wa bwangu nnyo.
He is so so.	Ye bw’atyo bw’atyo.
Maybe like here.	Mpozzi nga wano.
I didn’t even know where he lived.	Nali simanyi na gye yali abeera.
I’m so sorry about that.	Nsonyiwa nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
Not that it will matter.	Si nti kijja kuba kikulu.
That’s going on.	Ekyo kigenda mu maaso.
Knowledge in play.	Okumanya mu kuzannya.
Now they are together.	Kati bali wamu.
But that’s not the problem.	Naye ekyo si kye kizibu.
Really.	Kituufu.
In this room.	Mu kisenge kino.
That’s a good thing.	Ekyo kintu kirungi.
At the time I wanted it more than anything.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali njagala nnyo okusinga ekintu kyonna.
More than anyone else.	Okusinga omuntu yenna.
And this is obviously not good.	Era kino kirabika si kirungi.
Someone has to do it.	Waliwo alina okukikola.
It’s the same idea.	Kye kirowoozo kye kimu.
I could hardly believe it.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kukkiriza.
Tonight, dinner together.	Ekiro kya leero, ekyeggulo nga tuli wamu.
I knew this had to go.	Namanya nti kino kyalina okugenda.
But it’s not about you.	Naye si ku ggwe.
There is nothing wrong with them.	Tewali kibi kyonna gye bali.
He would have no choice.	Yandibadde talina kya kukola.
The same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu.
He was just one man.	Yali musajja omu yekka.
Advance purchases are highly recommended.	Okugula ebintu mu maaso kirungi nnyo.
We are hungry.	Tulina enjala.
No one was as young as they were.	Tewali yali muto nga bwe baali.
But my father is in this room.	Naye taata ali mu kisenge kino.
He felt so much better then.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo mu kiseera ekyo.
You and I were the same.	Nze naawe twali kye kimu.
There I am.	Eyo nange.
Obviously, this is very important.	Kya lwatu nti kino kikulu nnyo.
I’m sure I do.	Nkakasa nti nkola.
No one told me that.	Ekyo tewali yang’amba.
In...	Mu...
There is a lot of money in this process.	Ssente nnyingi mu nkola eno.
Maybe they were.	Mpozzi nga baali.
Actually more than that.	Mu butuufu okusinga awo.
Nothing.	Tewali.
I now know it.	Nze kati nkimanyi.
Getting stronger, or something.	Okufuna amaanyi, oba ekintu kyonna.
No one saw anything.	Tewali yalaba kintu kyonna.
All those things.	Ebintu ebyo byonna.
Leaving the house.	Okuva mu nnyumba.
He shouldn’t be here.	Tasaanidde kubeera wano.
This is not too difficult.	Kino si kizibu nnyo.
We were both very lucky.	Ffembi twali ba mukisa nnyo.
When he was young.	Bwe yali akyali muto.
Maybe, not always.	Mpozzi, si bulijjo.
I am very happy as it is now.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nga bwe kiri kati.
But it looked great.	Naye nga kirabika bulungi nnyo.
We needed somewhere to go.	Twali twetaaga we tugenda.
But maybe that was a bad thing.	Naye oboolyawo ekyo kyali kibi.
But he had to move on.	Naye yalina okugenda mu maaso.
And in fact.	Era mu mazima.
Not for you.	Si lwa ggwe.
I know you have it on you.	Nkimanyi nti olina ku ggwe.
It’s a strong job.	Omulimu gwa maanyi.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
It was dangerous in many ways.	Kyali kya bulabe mu ngeri nnyingi.
Or perhaps he could.	Oba oboolyawo yali asobola.
It’s not an opinion.	Si ndowooza.
Maybe they are not.	Mpozzi si bwe bali.
From work.	Okuva ku mulimu.
He wanted to know.	Yali ayagala okumanya.
Obviously they were.	Kya lwatu nti baali.
I couldn’t be happier.	Siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo.
I was sick all the time.	Nnali mulwadde buli kiseera.
He would do well.	Yandikoze bulungi.
It seems right to me.	Kirabika kituufu gyendi.
My brother was terrified.	Muganda wange yali atya nnyo.
I was doing really well.	Nali nkola bulungi ddala.
Whatever it is.	Kyonna kye kiri.
Not a very nice place.	Si kifo kirungi nnyo.
She was glad he went.	Yali musanyufu nti yagenda.
He didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala.
He didn’t want to do that.	Ekyo yali tayagala kukikola.
Just one of us now.	Omu yekka ku ffe kati.
But he's not here yet.	Naye tannaba wano.
This will work well.	Kino kijja kukola bulungi.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
I don’t ask for anything.	Nze sirina kye nsaba.
Each and every day.	Buli lunaku na buli lunaku.
No one is going home.	Tewali agenda waka.
I’m the only person in the room.	Nze nzekka omuntu mu kisenge.
This is a car.	Eno mmotoka.
He is still very human.	Akyali muntu nnyo.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
He loves those things.	Ayagala nnyo ebintu ebyo.
There is beauty in this.	Mu kino mulimu obulungi.
I didn’t know what to believe.	Nnali simanyi kya kukkiriza.
I have no idea.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
You know you won’t.	Omanyi nti tojja kukikola.
They are very powerful.	Bali ba maanyi nnyo.
I don’t think so.	Sirowooza nti.
This was harder than it looked.	Kino kyali kizibu okusinga bwe kyali kirabika.
He comes to me.	Ajja gyendi.
He knew there was a problem.	Yali akimanyi nti waliwo ekizibu.
He could have told the police.	Yali asobola okubuulira poliisi.
This, obviously, is not the case.	Kino, kirabika, si bwe kiri.
I can’t do anything at all.	Siyinza kukola kintu kyonna n’akatono.
Nothing will be the same without you.	Tewali kijja kuba kye kimu nga tolina ggwe.
In your car.	Mu mmotoka yo.
And it’s not true.	Era si kituufu.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
We need to talk.	Twetaaga okwogera.
He couldn't do anything about that now.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna kati.
It’s not us.	Si ffe.
I think he's just happy to have you on the scene.	Ndowooza musanyufu kyokka okubeera naawe ku kifo.
But, in many ways, it was wonderful.	Naye, mu ngeri nnyingi, kyali kirungi nnyo.
There is no place for me.	Tewali kifo kyange.
Eating at work.	Okulya ku mulimu.
He knew what was going on.	Yali amanyi ekigenda mu maaso.
I have three.	Nnina ssatu.
But the plan is the point.	Naye enteekateeka y’ensonga.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe yali.
I don’t have a home.	Nze sirina waka.
I think, anyway.	Ndowooza, mu ngeri yonna.
We will work to work.	Tujja kukola okukola.
This is not my place.	Kino si kye kifo kyange.
And speaking, obviously.	Era okwogera, kya lwatu.
That’s normal for me though.	Ekyo kya bulijjo gyendi wadde.
He went away reluctantly.	Yagenda nga tayagala.
A quick read works well.	Okusoma amangu kukola bulungi.
I can't see.	Sisobola kulaba.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
There is no place to go.	Tewali kifo kya kugenda.
He would do just fine.	Yandikoze bulungi nnyo.
I’ve been a player.	Mbadde muzannyi.
I thought it was really cool.	Nalowooza nti ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
He doesn’t have to do it.	Talina kukikola.
But he works for you too.	Naye naawe akola.
I could have done it.	Nnali nsobola okukola.
But he wasn’t like you.	Naye yali si nga ggwe.
I didn’t even know.	Nze na simanyi.
But not for very long.	Naye si bbanga ddene nnyo.
This was not what he wanted.	Kino si kye yali ayagala.
It was very dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
I’m doing better now, of course.	Nze nkola bulungi kati, ddala.
He has been mine.	Abadde wange.
And my father knew that.	Era taata ekyo yali akimanyi.
There is nothing complicated about it.	Tewali kintu kizibu ku nsonga eyo.
For me, this is true.	Nze kino kituufu.
No, you already have.	Nedda, olina dda.
But I was so happy that he was going to be okay.	Naye nnali musanyufu nnyo nti yali agenda kuba bulungi.
It’s not just doing something.	Si kukola kintu kyokka.
It was a moment of truth.	Kyali kiseera kya mazima.
You obviously aren’t ready.	Kya lwatu nti toli mwetegefu.
On the weekends.	Ku wiikendi.
It won’t be for long.	Tekijja kuba kya bbanga ddene.
I was alone with him.	Nze nange twali yekka.
I am going to do this myself.	Kino ngenda kukikola nze kennyini.
But he doesn’t have it.	Naye talina.
Thinking, thinking, thinking .	Okulowooza, okulowooza, okulowooza .
But that will be hard to do.	Naye ekyo kijja kuba kizibu okukikola.
No one knows who it is.	Tewali amanyi ani.
I knew that would do that.	Nali nkimanyi nti ekyo kijja kukola ekyo.
I have to go home.	Nnina okudda eka.
He must think he was lucky.	Ateekwa okulowooza nti yalina omukisa.
He works, he has a job.	Akola, alina omulimu.
He thought he was asleep.	Yalowooza nti yeebase.
Something in that, perhaps.	Ekintu mu ekyo, mpozzi.
Everyone knows that.	Ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
And he is sick.	Era mulwadde.
As well as being beautiful.	Nga bwe kiri nga kirungi.
However, it was certainly good for them.	Kyokka, mazima ddala kyali kirungi gye bali.
He would have been there.	Yandibadde awo.
We could do anything.	Twali tusobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
You’re the one with the problem.	Ggwe alina obuzibu.
I can speak now.	Nsobola okwogera kati.
I go to them.	Ngenda gye bali.
He didn’t know she knew.	Yali tamanyi nti yali amanyi.
I have a house.	Nnina ennyumba.
I am happy.	Ndi musanyufu.
Although he tried.	Wadde nga yagezaako.
No, no no no and no.	Nedda, nedda nedda nedda era nedda.
Nothing really complicated going on there.	Tewali kintu kizibu ddala kigenda mu maaso eyo.
As it may be.	Nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
It was just where you said.	Kyali we wagamba kyokka.
For all he knew, that was true.	Ku byonna bye yali amanyi, ekyo kyali kituufu.
I couldn’t go any deeper.	Nnali sisobola kugenda wansi nnyo.
However, it would be so many things.	Kyokka, kyandibadde ebintu bingi nnyo.
I said it was going to happen.	Nagamba nti kigenda kubaawo.
Speaking in this way.	Okwogera mu ngeri eno.
However, this is very speculative.	Kyokka, kino kya kwogera nnyo.
I couldn’t go anywhere.	Nnali sisobola kugenda yonna.
And he doesn’t need her.	Era teyeetaaga ye.
I thought he was sick.	Nalowooza nti yali mulwadde.
He says he has to talk to me.	Agamba nti alina okwogera nange.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
Any of us.	Omuntu yenna ku ffe.
Everyone knew that about me.	Ekyo buli omu yali akimanyi ku nze.
Below, there is the date.	Wansi, waliwo olunaku.
Maybe the reason you know it.	Mpozzi ensonga lwaki okimanyi.
You’ll be fine.	Ojja kuba bulungi.
I don’t want trouble.	Saagala buzibu.
He could do anything.	Yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
And he still doesn’t know.	Era n’okutuusa kati tamanyi.
This is not very good.	Kino si kirungi nnyo.
We have it isn’t.	Tulina si bwe kiri.
Everything was really good.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi ddala.
It was in him alone.	Kyali mu ye yekka.
The house knew about it.	Ennyumba eyo yali amanyi ku nsonga eyo.
I thought maybe .	Nalowooza nti osanga .
On the subject.	Ku nsonga.
This is all going down.	Kino kyonna kigenda wansi.
We’ll see what happens.	Tujja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
I always feel that sentiment.	Endowooza eyo bulijjo mpulira.
He has no idea.	Talina kirowoozo kyonna.
That’s right, baby.	Ekyo kituufu mwana wange.
And they were everywhere.	Era baali buli wamu.
I am very lucky.	Nze ndi wa mukisa nnyo.
But we’ll be fine.	Naye tujja kuba bulungi.
Just what he needed.	Kye yali yeetaaga kyokka.
But that doesn’t matter now.	Naye ekyo si kikulu kati.
He didn't know what he was talking about.	Yali tamanyi kye yali ayogera.
I know he is telling the truth.	Nkimanyi nti ayogera mazima.
He loves this movie.	Ayagala nnyo firimu eno.
You are absolutely fine.	Oli bulungi ddala.
I could go on for a while.	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu maaso okumala akaseera.
Will try today.	Ajja kugezaako leero.
I don’t know for a long time.	Simanyi ku bbanga ddene.
He didn’t even know.	Yali tamanyi na kumanya.
I was in the.	Nze nnali mu.
This does not seem to be the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
Now he would have to go home.	Kati yandibadde alina okudda eka.
But it was just what he expected.	Naye kyali ekyo kyokka kye yali asuubira.
We are so close.	Tuli kumpi nnyo.
This is where the problem lies.	Wano we wali obuzibu.
Very very very very.	Ennyo nnyo nnyo.
He had it.	Yalina.
So he knew my wife.	Bwatyo yali amanyi mukyala wange.
He won’t be able to.	Tajja kusobola.
I could do that now.	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola kati.
That's why we're coming.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tujja.
He is strong and fast.	Alina amaanyi era wa bwangu.
But it was a quick process.	Naye yali nkola ya mangu.
It’s not me.	Si nze.
And he loves his job.	Era ayagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
I can’t be strong right now.	Sisobola kuba wa maanyi mu kiseera kino.
I am, he said.	Nze, bwe yagamba.
It was time to go.	Kyali kiseera kya kugenda.
More than anything he wanted to go with her.	Okusinga ekintu kyonna yali ayagala okugenda naye.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
I’m not really going any further, he thought.	Mu butuufu sigenda mu maaso, bwe yalowooza.
But they were both.	Naye baali bombi.
I needed to see.	Nnali nneetaaga okulaba.
This is, of course, true.	Kino, kya lwatu, kituufu.
That was the plan, anyway.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka, mu ngeri yonna.
It was time to get to work.	Kyali kiseera okutuuka ku mulimu.
I was so happy to be here.	Nali musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano.
It was on me.	Yali ku nze.
You are truly the best.	Ggwe ddala asinga obulungi.
I know it well enough.	Nze nkimanyi bulungi.
You were just a kid.	Ggwe wali mwana muto yekka.
In the evening.	Akawungeezi.
I was thinking of you, she said.	Nze nali ndowooza ku ggwe, bwe yagamba.
He must be like.	Alina okuba nga.
It was a sin.	Kyali kibi.
I should have thought.	Nnali nsaanidde okulowooza.
You will find someone.	Ojja kufuna omuntu.
And he did that.	Era ekyo yakikola.
I really want to.	Njagala ddala.
No, not just better, than that.	Nedda, si kirungi kyokka, okusinga ekyo.
And of course we can go now.	Era ddala tusobola okugenda kati.
This is going to be hard though.	Kino kigenda kuba kizibu wadde.
I do, anyway.	Nze nkola, mu ngeri yonna.
Not in the slightest.	N’akatono ennyo.
And not one now, either.	Era si omu kati, naye.
In fact, it can help.	Mu butuufu, kiyinza okuyamba.
Here we are.	Wano we tuli.
Well! 	Bulungi!
It’s not the same thing at all.	Si kintu kye kimu n’akatono.
However, that was the problem.	Kyokka, ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
He agreed and that was that.	Yakkiriza era ekyo kye kyali.
I don’t even want to know.	Saagala na kumanya.
He was eager to help in any way he could.	Yali ayagala nnyo okuyamba mu ngeri yonna gye yali asobola.
I don’t know what to do.	Simanyi kya kukola.
Maybe he’s sick.	Mpozzi nga mulwadde.
I don’t know if this is true or not.	Simanyi oba kino kituufu oba nedda.
That was me.	Oyo nnali nze.
We’re going now.	Tugenda kati.
It’s hard to picture.	Kizibu okukuba ekifaananyi.
Anyone can.	Omuntu yenna asobola.
Excuse me for a moment.	Nsonyiwa akaseera katono.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
It was a very close thing.	Kyali kintu kya kumpi nnyo.
That was a powerful moment.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
Not doing anything.	Obutakola kintu kyonna.
Maybe tomorrow afternoon.	Mpozzi enkya akawungeezi.
Now you are with me.	Kati oli nange.
It’s this.	Kye kino.
Either way it was just the two of us now.	Mu ngeri yonna kati twali ffembi ffekka.
He knew he had been in one before.	Yali akimanyi nti yali abadde mu emu emabegako.
It’s not easy, it’s not easy.	Si kyangu, si kyangu.
That’s how he was doing.	Bw’atyo bwe yali akola.
You are truly a strong brother.	Mazima ddala oli muganda wa maanyi.
He has it now.	Alina kati.
Except for something.	Okuggyako ekintu.
I can’t tell what’s going on.	Sisobola kumanya kigenda mu maaso.
He needed the money, of course.	Ssente yali yeetaaga, mazima ddala.
I think that’s really all we need now.	Ndowooza ddala ekyo kyokka kye twetaaga kati.
Of course, he really was.	Kya lwatu nti ddala yali.
I love this job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu guno.
And this was normal.	Era kino kyali kya bulijjo.
For us, this is very important.	Ffe kino kikulu nnyo.
I’m sure it’s not.	Nkakasa nti si bwe kiri.
Everyone lives so close.	Buli muntu abeera kumpi nnyo.
No one knows for sure.	Tewali amanyi bulungi.
I think it’s a matter of perspective.	Ndowooza nsonga ya ndowooza.
This can happen in many ways.	Kino kiyinza okubaawo mu ngeri nnyingi.
I question that assumption.	Nbuusabuusa endowooza eyo.
He can’t have done it.	Tayinza kuba nga yakikola.
I and you are like you.	Nze naawe nga ggwe.
I guess this is why.	Ntebereza nti eno y’ensonga lwaki.
I have no idea how to proceed.	Sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso.
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kintu kirungi.
That’s what I love.	Ekyo kye njagala ennyo.
No, no, it’s important.	Nedda, nedda, kikulu.
I am not in any organization.	Siri mu kibiina kyonna.
She loves dogs.	Ayagala nnyo embwa.
And then there was the picture.	Era awo we yali ekifaananyi.
Where we are.	Ffe we ​​tuli.
No one is in sight.	Tewali muntu yenna alabika.
I want to go again.	Njagala okuddamu okugenda.
I'm not so sure.	Sikakasa bulungi nnyo.
Now below is my argument.	Kati wansi waliwo ensonga yange.
Maybe it actually was.	Mpozzi mu butuufu bwe kyali.
No one goes alone.	Tewali agenda yekka.
As in you alone.	Nga mu ggwe wekka.
Not even tonight.	Si wadde ekiro kino.
I wanted to be alone with you for a while.	Nnali njagala kubeera naawe nzekka okumala akaseera.
You are.	Oli.
I don’t want that.	Ekyo saagala.
But it was very difficult.	Naye kyali kizibu nnyo.
I’m not with him.	Nze siri naye.
But it’s not us.	Naye si ffe.
But I can’t do it.	Naye sisobola kukikola.
The other wasn’t.	Omulala si bwe kyali.
He did it for me.	Yakikola gyendi.
I have to go home.	Nnina okudda eka.
For his money.	Ku ssente ze.
She is still a woman.	Akyali mukyala.
We can’t do without it.	Tetusobola kukola nga tetulina.
He really is a gay man.	Ddala ye muganzi.
He is a man.	Ye musajja.
What they are.	Kye bali.
But work, yes, that’s hard.	Naye omulimu, ye, ekyo kizibu.
Someone is doing it.	Waliwo akikola.
I’m sure there is.	Nkakasa nti waliwo.
He didn't know how to answer.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ya kuddamu.
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Sikakasa buzibu ki bwe buli.
We just aren’t.	Ffe si bwe tuli kyokka.
Under.	Wansi.
He wasn’t pretty, but he wasn’t homely.	Yali si mulungi, naye si wa waka.
Which is not the case.	Kye si bwe kiri.
This was hard to say.	Kino kyali kizibu okwogera.
Better.	Okusinga.
I think my father is here.	Ndowooza taata ali wano.
If only he knew.	Singa yali amanyi.
He would have to, he always did.	Yandibadde alina okukikola, bulijjo yakikola.
All but one.	Byonna okuggyako omu.
I know he did it.	Nkimanyi nti yakikola.
No one was with him.	Tewali yali naye.
One of us.	Omu ku ffe.
Working hard, too.	Okukola ennyo, era.
The viewing continues.	Okulaba kugenda mu maaso.
I have had to do it.	Nze mbadde nnina okukikola.
They are in school.	Bali mu ssomero.
I'm not really well.	Mu butuufu siri bulungi.
As he always was.	Nga bwe yali bulijjo.
That is very common.	Ekyo kya bulijjo nnyo.
It looks like nothing.	Kirabika nga tewali kintu kyonna.
I’m sick of it.	Nze ndi mulwadde.
He didn’t want to go.	Yali tayagala kugenda.
You know what’s going to happen.	Omanyi ekigenda okubaawo.
And you don’t have to.	Era tolina kukikola.
Spell.	Okwogera.
But it doesn’t seem to be.	Naye kirabika si bwe kiri.
He was doing very well.	Yali akola bulungi nnyo.
That person is harmless.	Omuntu oyo talina bulabe.
No, maybe you won’t.	Nedda, mpozzi tojja kukikola.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kye kimu.
It’s easy for you to talk.	Kyangu gyoli okwogera.
That is why you are here.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki oli wano.
He says he has a plan for everything.	Agamba nti buli kimu alina enteekateeka.
I know that I am.	Nkimanyi nti nze.
I know that it is not.	Nkimanyi nti si bwe kiri.
I'll find a way or make one.	Nja kufuna engeri oba okukola emu.
He was doing very well.	Yali akola bulungi nnyo.
He didn’t know what he was doing.	Yali tamanyi kye yali akola.
I am very happy.	Nze ndi musanyufu nnyo.
It was to me now.	Kyali eri nze kati.
He couldn’t.	Yali tasobola.
It is and it is not.	Kiri era si bwe kiri.
There is no plan.	Tewali nteekateeka.
He was ready.	Yali mwetegefu.
Suddenly, he knew what he wanted.	Amangu ddala, yali amanyi kye yali ayagala.
That alone is not true.	Ekyo kyokka si kye kituufu.
That’s not me.	Ekyo si nze.
It’s my job.	Gwe mulimu gwange.
However, this is not the case.	Naye, kino si bwe kiri.
What he wanted to say.	Kye yali ayagala okwogera.
He would love to know.	Yandiyagadde nnyo okumanya.
He needed food.	Yali yeetaaga emmere.
I know exactly what that is.	Nkimanyi bulungi ekyo bwe kiri.
Now it will be easier.	Kati kijja kuba kyangu.
Good for me!.	Kirungi gyendi!.
Obviously not.	Kya lwatu si bwe kiri.
That is what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
And it’s not hard to do.	Era si kizibu kukola.
Everyone knows this to be true.	Kino buli omu akimanyi nti kituufu.
And mostly true.	Era okusinga kituufu.
But he had it coming.	Naye yalina nga kijja.
But that wasn’t the point.	Naye eyo si ye yali ensonga.
But they are not.	Naye si bwe bali.
I will definitely buy one.	Mazima ddala nja kugula emu.
But even.	Naye ne...
That was absolutely true.	Ekyo kyali kituufu nnyo.
It's there, of course.	Kiri awo, ddala.
I will keep working on it.	Nja kusigala nga nkola ku nsonga eyo.
Maybe he’ll know where we can talk.	Mpozzi ajja kumanya we tusobola okwogera.
And he was.	Era yali.
He knew it all too well.	Yali akimanyi bulungi nnyo.
For that matter.	Ku nsonga eyo.
And for a while, that was a problem.	Era okumala akaseera, ekyo kyali kizibu.
He couldn’t go to work.	Yali tasobola kugenda ku mulimu.
Now this is why.	Kati eno y’ensonga lwaki.
Whatever happens, will happen.	Kyonna ekigenda okubaawo, kijja kuba.
That would be a problem.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
It’s completely up to you.	Kiri gy’oli ddala.
He knew what he was planning.	Yali amanyi kye yali ateekateeka.
I wonder about that.	Ekyo nneebuuza.
I needed some time.	Nnali nneetaaga akaseera.
Very happy to see this.	Musanyufu nnyo okulaba kino.
He was my brother .	Yali muganda wange .
This is certainly true.	Mazima ddala kino kituufu.
He has no idea of ​​his role.	Talina kirowoozo kyonna ku kifo kye.
However, that is not the point here.	Kyokka, ekyo si kye kikulu wano.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
No time to go get help.	Tewali budde bwa kugenda kufuna buyambi.
It was very dangerous actually.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo mu butuufu.
He has been in my house.	Abadde mu nnyumba yange.
Getting the facts.	Okufuna ensonga.
And even then it won’t be too hard.	Era ne mu kiseera ekyo tekijja kuba kizibu nnyo.
The problem is you don’t move forward.	Obuzibu togenda mu maaso.
And it is a very serious problem.	Era kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I will certainly win.	Mazima ddala nja kuwangula.
However, I wasn’t going to do it.	Kyokka nnali sigenda kukikola.
Hope.	Essuubi.
He told me no.	Yang’amba nti nedda.
It was pretty good for me.	Yali nnungi nnyo gyendi.
I don’t like it.	Sikyagala.
But that’s not the point.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga.
I’m sure it was great.	Nkakasa nti kyali kirungi nnyo.
Or a dog.	Oba embwa.
You may have it.	Oyinza okuba nga olina.
It is the same but not the same.	Kye kimu naye si kye kimu.
He had a reason for doing so.	Yalina ensonga lwaki yali akola bw’atyo.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
And if he was there.	Era singa yali awo.
He can’t do this.	Kino tasobola kukikola.
And, at the same time, that was a problem for us.	Era, mu kiseera kye kimu, ekyo kyali kizibu gye tuli.
What do you think of this idea?.	Olowooza ki ku ndowooza eno?.
Now you will come with us.	Kati ojja kujja naffe.
You will love this product.	Ojja kwagala nnyo ekintu kino.
He knew she looked good.	Yali akimanyi nti alabika bulungi.
I was almost sick.	Nnali kumpi mulwadde.
He was doing all of that alone.	Ekyo kyonna yali akikola yekka.
Whatever we need.	Kyonna kye twetaaga.
Good, but not that good.	Mulungi, naye si mulungi bw’atyo.
And honestly, it’s very difficult.	Era mu butuufu, kizibu nnyo.
And so was he.	Era naye bwe yali.
I won’t talk about that again today.	Ekyo sijja kuddamu kwogera ku ekyo leero.
He shouldn’t have done that.	Ekyo yali tasaanidde kukikola.
And of course he agreed.	Era ddala yakkiriza.
He is very young.	Muto nnyo.
Not here though.	Si wano wadde.
I am here now.	Nze ndi wano kati.
It would be us.	Kyandibadde ffe.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
But he may have had.	Naye ayinza okuba nga yalina.
We'll get back to you shortly.	Tujja kudda gy'oli mu bbanga ttono.
He loved to read.	Yali ayagala nnyo okusoma.
It will never work again.	Tekijja kuddamu kukola.
He thought a lot about this movie.	Yalowooza nnyo ku firimu eno.
And that’s what he did.	Era ekyo kye yakola.
This is very dangerous.	Kino kya bulabe nnyo.
The thing had him.	Ekintu kyalina ye.
I think that looks good.	Ndowooza ekyo kirabika bulungi.
He will be here soon.	Ajja kubeera wano mu bbanga ttono.
It’s not one of a kind.	Si kimu kya ngeri emu.
The guy, of course.	Ggaayi, ddala.
Everyone except me.	Buli muntu okuggyako nze.
Thought that was a good idea.	Yalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
It probably won’t though.	Oboolyawo tekijja kukikola wadde.
He's already gone.	Yagenda dda.
I am now early.	Nze kati bukyali.
He fell asleep.	Yeebase.
Maybe he can’t talk to you.	Mpozzi nga tasobola kwogera naawe.
He's good to you.	Ali mulungi gy'oli.
I’m sure this will be great.	Nkakasa nti kino kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
It’s true for everyone.	Kituufu eri buli muntu.
I couldn’t even find my car.	Nnali sisobola na kufuna mmotoka yange.
And he loves it too.	Era naye ayagala nnyo ku.
It doesn’t matter if it’s good or bad.	Si nsonga oba kirungi oba kibi.
You have to get out of here.	Olina okuva wano.
That’s what’s there.	Ekyo kye kiri awo.
Now he really knows it.	Kati ddala akimanyi.
He was more real than you.	Yali wa ddala okusinga ggwe.
I knew this.	Kino nnali nkimanyi.
Now he could see something, but not what.	Kati yali asobola okulaba ekintu, naye si kiki.
He knew that better than anyone.	Ekyo yali akimanyi okusinga omuntu yenna.
You don’t want to go back to where you were.	Toyagala kudda gye wali.
He wanted to do well.	Yali ayagala okukola obulungi.
Now you are.	Kati ggwe oli.
It won’t be any problem.	Tekijja kuba kizibu kyonna.
It’s really easy.	Ddala kyangu.
I love my dad so much.	Njagala nnyo taata wange.
As if no one is home.	Nga bwe kiri nti tewali muntu yenna ali waka.
It’s not a movie.	Si firimu.
That’s what he wanted, too.	Ekyo naye yali ayagala.
However, it was wrong.	Kyokka, kyali kibi.
It was a beautiful city.	Kyali kibuga kirungi nnyo.
He knew better than that.	Yali amanyi bulungi okusinga ekyo.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika nga mulungi nnyo.
Not even him.	Si wadde ye.
He wasn’t going to do it.	Yali tagenda kukikola.
You can't.	Tosobola.
I can do a lot of that.	Ekyo nsobola okukola bingi.
I don’t know that that’s necessarily bad or good.	Simanyi nti ekyo kituufu nti kibi oba kirungi.
He's here.	Ali wano.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
He was a man.	Yali musajja.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
This would be a bad thing.	Kino kyandibadde kintu kibi.
My job is to.	Omulimu gwange.
He really does the job.	Ddala akola omulimu.
And ready to talk.	Era nga mwetegefu okwogera.
I'll be.	Nja kuba.
We will have to work hard.	Tujja kuba tulina okukola ennyo.
But this is not the case at all.	Naye kino si bwe kiri n’akatono.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe yali.
These are the following.	Bino bye bino.
I'm sorry this afternoon.	Nsonyiwa akawungeezi ka leero.
There is something we can do.	Waliwo kye tusobola okukola.
And you know, it almost happened.	Era omanyi, kyali kumpi okubaawo.
It’s really really important.	Ddala ddala kikulu nnyo.
Not just any man.	Si musajja yenna.
Or early in the morning.	Oba ku makya ennyo.
As he requested.	Nga bwe yasaba.
We need a picture.	Twetaaga ekifaananyi.
Of course, this is not the case at all.	Kya lwatu nti kino si bwe kiri n’akatono.
But that was something.	Naye ekyo kyali kintu.
It was the only thing he could do.	Kye kintu kyokka kye yali asobola okukola.
I knew about one.	Nnali mmanyi ku kimu.
One just has to accept his facts.	Omuntu alina kumala kukkiriza nsonga ze.
I am only one man.	Nze ndi musajja omu yekka.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
No one knows how.	Tewali amanyi ngeri ki.
He is a good child.	Ye mwana mulungi.
I have the time and money now.	Nnina obudde ne ssente kati.
However, he did not want to do that.	Kyokka, ekyo yali tayagala kukikola.
But I can’t wait.	Kyokka siyinza kulinda.
Not even today.	Si ne leero.
You have to work.	Olina okukola.
This was his call from work.	Eno ye yali essimu ye okuva ku mulimu.
This is what he is.	Kino ky’ali.
However, that was probably not the case.	Kyokka, oboolyawo ekyo si kye kyali.
More than a dog.	Okusinga embwa.
It can easily happen to any of us.	Kyangu okutuuka ku muntu yenna ku ffe.
He would have been like that.	Yandibadde bw’atyo.
But you can’t tell.	Naye tosobola kumanya.
She suddenly felt better.	Yawulira bulungi mu bwangu.
He had to think.	Yalina okulowooza.
No one was particularly interested.	Tewali yali ayagala nnyo.
I am not sure what to do.	Sikakasa kya kukola.
This is really something.	Kino ddala kintu.
Apparently this is in place.	Kirabika kino kiri mu kifo.
I'll be back soon.	Nja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
Now we have to go.	Kati tulina okugenda.
No, it’s not true.	Nedda, si kituufu nti.
He certainly has to.	Mazima ddala alina okukikola.
I know what it is.	Nze mmanyi kiki.
I'm sure.	Nkakasa.
Everything looks exactly the same.	Buli kimu kirabika kye kimu ddala.
He looks like he used to live with us.	Alabika nga bwe yali abeera naffe.
Here it was good.	Wano kyali kirungi.
Soon he would be home.	Mu bbanga ttono yandibadde awaka.
It wasn’t what he wanted.	Si kye yali ayagala.
What a thing.	Nga kintu ki.
The hour is near.	Essaawa eri kumpi.
I'm glad you made it this far.	Ndi musanyufu nti osobola okutuuka wano.
It won’t be very good.	Tekijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali.
I'm going with you.	Nze ngenda naawe.
The attitude was good.	Endowooza yali nnungi.
No one wanted to do anything at all.	Tewali yali ayagala kukola kintu kyonna n’akatono.
Money is the time.	Ssente kye kiseera.
I know how to drive.	Nze mmanyi okuvuga.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
But he wasn’t a kid.	Naye nga si mwana muto.
I wonder if this is going to work.	Nze nneebuuza oba kino kigenda kukola.
. . . .	.
But it was the case.	Naye bwe kyali.
I have a lot to do.	Nnina bingi bye nnina okukola.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I'll move on.	Nja kugenda mu maaso.
It’s not for you either.	Naawe si kya ggwe.
We don’t have time to do it.	Tetulina budde bwa kukikola.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
And that’s what’s important.	Era ekyo kye kikulu.
In theory, this could work well.	Mu ndowooza, kino kiyinza okukola obulungi.
He was more real to me than myself.	Yali wa ddala gyendi okusinga nze kennyini.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
But he didn’t need to.	Naye yali teyeetaaga.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
Money, money, money.	Ssente, ssente, ssente.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
That may or may not be the case.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri oba nedda.
Together, we can win.	Nga tuli wamu, tusobola okuwangula.
It’s the same thing.	Kye kimu.
It seems about right to me.	Kirabika nga kituufu gyendi.
He was going, apparently, anyway.	Yali agenda, kirabika, mu ngeri yonna.
This is what I want.	Kino kye njagala.
He knew what he needed.	Yali amanyi kye yali yeetaaga.
He worked very, very hard to be where he was.	Yakola nnyo nnyo nnyo okubeera we yali.
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola.
I think that’s a good thing.	Ndowooza ekyo kintu kirungi.
This is not a plan.	Eno si nteekateeka.
I do have interests.	Nze ddala nnina bye njagala.
Down on the horizon.	Wansi ku bbanga.
The police already had.	Poliisi yalina dda...
He would have had a lot of trouble.	Yandibadde alina obuzibu bungi.
That's the point here.	Eyo y'ensonga eri wano.
It’s much more complicated than that.	Kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
Getting help.	Okufuna obuyambi.
I still can’t believe anyone would do that.	N’okutuusa kati siyinza kukkiriza nti waliwo omuntu yandikoze ekyo.
He's on to something.	Ali ku kintu.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
They are just there.	Bali awo kyokka.
That was really close.	Ekyo kyali kya kumpi ddala.
She is a happy wife.	Mukyala musanyufu.
I have something.	Nze nnina ekintu.
There is only one problem.	Ekizibu kimu kyokka.
Maybe even this one.	Mpozzi ne kino.
I thought he and I were friends.	Nalowooza nti nze naye twali ba mukwano.
But we are, too.	Naye naffe tuli.
But for him it wasn’t.	Naye ku ye si bwe kyali.
Obviously you’re the guy.	Kya lwatu nti ggwe ggaayi.
I don’t think he has.	Sirowooza nti alina.
He loves to eat.	Ayagala nnyo okulya.
He's the only one who has.	Ye yekka abadde alina.
You will know everything.	Ojja kumanya buli kimu.
But not everything.	Naye si buli kimu.
But ‘this’ was bad.	Naye ‘kino’ kyali kibi.
He had everything.	Yalina buli kimu.
I will and you must go.	Nja kukikola era olina okugenda.
This was a terrible thing.	Kino kyali kibi nnyo.
And that may be true.	Era ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
It’s really pretty cool.	Ddala kirungi nnyo.
One is willing to help the other.	Omu yenna mwetegefu okuyamba omulala.
I said fine.	Nagamba nti bulungi.
I thought that was good.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi.
That’s a really good thing.	Ekyo kintu kirungi ddala.
This is not the case now.	Kino si bwe kiri kati.
That’s all it would be.	Ekyo kyokka kye kyandibadde.
He wanted to be with you.	Yali ayagala okubeera naawe.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
Of course, you can.	Kya lwatu nti osobola.
That’s where we are.	Eyo gye tuli.
I am so glad he did.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo bwe yakola.
The point is that.	Ensonga eri nti.
No one had anything to say.	Tewali yalina kya kwogera.
I'm going to a party.	Ngenda ku kabaga.
The food was excellent.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
And it was the same.	Era bwe kyali.
Not that there’s a problem with that.	Si nti waliwo obuzibu ku ekyo.
He knows his brother.	Amanyi muganda we.
It will come.	Kijja kujja.
This was what he really wanted.	Kino kye yali ayagala ennyo.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
Not without energy.	Si nga tewali maanyi.
But there was that thing.	Naye nga waliwo ekintu ekyo.
He didn’t want to know.	Yali tayagala kumanya.
He was all that.	Yali ebyo byonna.
He probably thought it was better than it really was.	Oboolyawo yalowooza nti kyali kirungi okusinga bwe kyali ddala.
We all have to go in an hour.	Ffenna tulina okugenda mu ssaawa emu.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
As difficult as it was.	Nga bwe kyali kizibu.
It was that kind of place.	Kyali kifo kya ngeri eyo.
He could not win this argument.	Ensonga eno yali tasobola kuwangula.
That's what he said.	Bwatyo bwe yagamba.
It can happen here.	Kiyinza okubaawo wano.
And he knew when…	Era yali amanyi ddi...
Do you want to continue?.	Oyagala okugenda mu maaso?.
You will work long hours and you will work hard.	Ojja kukola essaawa nnyingi era ojja kukola nnyo.
That goes with us.	Ekyo kigenda naffe.
He has been good to me.	Abadde mulungi gyendi.
He doesn’t have a car.	Talina mmotoka.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
He had it now.	Yalina kati.
I knew it was now or else.	Namanya nti kati oba si bwe kiri.
No one could.	Tewali yali asobola.
It had to be someone else.	Kyalina okuba omuntu omulala.
He is not in immediate danger.	Tali mu bulabe bwa mangu.
I love dogs.	Njagala nnyo embwa.
We can’t do this.	Kino tetusobola kukikola.
And my wife.	Ne mukyala wange.
But this was wrong.	Naye kino kyali kibi.
But he is.	Naye ye.
However, not everyone is.	Kyokka si buli muntu bw’atyo.
I was the one who was.	Nze nnali nnali.
He started working.	Yatandika okukola...
This is an easy thing to do.	Kino kintu kyangu okukola.
He worked hard, and he was a good friend.	Yakola nnyo, era yali mukwano gwange mulungi.
This had to be real.	Kino kyalina okuba nga kya ddala.
That was me too.	Oyo nange nnali.
But he said, no, he doesn’t want to come with me.	Naye n’agamba nti, nedda, tayagala kujja nange.
But now he isn't.	Naye kati tali bw'atyo.
We can’t get any help.	Tetusobola kufuna buyambi bwonna.
No one wanted to be the one to talk.	Tewali yali ayagala kubeera oyo agenda kwogera.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
He probably didn't want to talk about it.	Oboolyawo yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
I really didn’t want to go.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kugenda.
But not too quickly.	Naye si mu bwangu nnyo.
But no one said that.	Naye tewali yayogera ekyo.
At this point, everyone knew why.	Mu kiseera kino, buli omu yali amanyi lwaki.
Like the thing is.	Nga ekintu bwe kiri.
Of course, it was.	Kya lwatu, bwe kyali.
There is no money.	Tewali ssente.
I don’t think it will happen.	Sirowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
Now it’s mine.	Kati kyange.
That’s important to me.	Ekyo kikulu gyendi.
That’s what everyone was doing.	Ekyo buli omu kye yali akola.
I work very very very hard.	Nkola nnyo nnyo nnyo.
You love it so much.	Ggwe ayagala nnyo.
Which side do you want to be on?.	Ggwe oyagala kubeera ku ludda ki?.
Everyone loves money.	Buli muntu ayagala nnyo ssente.
Is this true?.	Kino kituufu?.
My beautiful wife.	Mukyala wange omulungi.
I wish I could be his friend.	Njagala nnyo okubeera mukwano gwe.
He had no idea what to do.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna kya kukola.
It would be nice down there.	Kyandibadde kirungi wansi awo.
No one wanted to buy the product.	Tewali yali ayagala kugula kintu ekyo.
It’s still early.	Bukyali bukyali.
I’m really quick.	Nze ndi wa bwangu ddala.
But it’s a sin.	Naye kibi.
I am very, very sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo nnyo.
And you might be with us.	Era oyinza okuba nga naffe.
He told me that, himself.	Ekyo yangamba, ye kennyini.
You should have come with me.	Wandibadde ojja nange.
I don’t know what it was.	Simanyi ki kye kyali.
Everything is there.	Buli kimu kiri awo.
He wanted his son.	Yali ayagala mwana we.
In that case,.	Mu mbeera eyo,...
He was my father.	Yali taata wange.
That may be true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
No, it’s not good.	Nedda, si kirungi.
You are mine.	Ggwe oli wange.
I was powerless.	Nnali sirina maanyi.
But I'm not.	Naye nze.
Apparently it was an office a while ago.	Kirabika yali ofiisi akaseera katono emabega.
You just have to know.	Olina kumala kumanya.
That’s coming now.	Ekyo kijja kati.
He wanted to go to work.	Yali ayagala kugenda ku mulimu.
She suddenly looks better.	Alabika bulungi mu bwangu.
You don’t have to do this.	Kino tolina kukikola.
To me, it is what it is.	Eri nze, kye kiri.
That way you like me.	Mu ngeri eyo ggwe nga nze.
I knew you would come.	Nali mmanyi nti ojja kujja.
He was beautiful.	Yali mulungi.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
He did a really good job.	Yakola omulimu mulungi ddala.
It’s really pretty cool.	Ddala kirungi nnyo.
I can’t talk to him.	Sisobola kwogera naye.
I’m making energy.	Nkola amaanyi.
Or he thinks he knows.	Oba alowooza nti amanyi.
But really, that's just me.	Naye ddala, oyo nze nzekka.
Anyone else saw this.	Omuntu omulala yenna yalaba kino.
We cannot say this.	Kino tetusobola kwogera.
He just knows it.	Akimanyi kyokka.
He made my night.	Yakola ekiro kyange.
He didn’t want to go.	Yali tayagala kugenda.
You are here with me.	Oli wano nange.
He felt very alone.	Yawulira nga yekka nnyo.
He is the only one.	Ye yekka yekka.
I don’t care about anything.	Sifaayo ku kintu kyonna.
This is not what he wants.	Kino si ky’ayagala.
He is not me.	Ye si nze.
I want it soon.	Njagala mangu.
I think you should go home.	Ndowooza olina okudda eka.
It would be with him.	Kyandibadde naye.
He is in good shape with us now.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi naffe kati.
Very happy so far.	Musanyufu nnyo okutuusa kati.
However, there is.	Kyokka waliwo...
You know you have something to say.	Omanyi nti olina ky’oyagala okwogera.
I just know this.	Kino nkimanyi kyokka.
That’s very hard to do.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo okukola.
Bye now.	Bye kati.
That's a thing.	Ekyo kintu.
Nobody says that.	Tewali ayogera bw’atyo.
I needed to know.	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya.
Definitely something for everyone.	Mazima ddala ekintu kya buli muntu.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
None of this was any good.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kyali kirungi kyonna.
I have no idea what it is.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki.
We’re going to do what we’re going to do.	Tugenda kukola kye tugenda okukola.
That was a good thing.	Ekyo kyali kintu kirungi.
It is very, very hard to do it actually.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo okukikola mu butuufu.
Without each other.	Nga tewali buli omu.
I don't care what.	Sifaayo ku ki.
I have plans to make.	Nnina enteekateeka ze nnina okukola.
We have to go.	Tulina okugenda.
Obviously, it’s not the same.	Kya lwatu nti si kye kimu.
We have to move forward.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso.
Or perhaps he couldn’t.	Oba oboolyawo yali tasobola.
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kirungi.
He had been in danger.	Yali abadde mu bulabe.
Then he knew what to do.	Awo n’amanya ky’alina okukola.
I'll try it.	Nja kugezaako.
It was easy.	Kyali kyangu.
Maybe it was him.	Mpozzi nga ye yali.
So he accepted everything.	Bwatyo yakkiriza buli kimu.
But not everyone can do this.	Naye kino si buli muntu nti asobola okukikola.
Now, and always.	Kati, era bulijjo.
That’s a good thing, in my opinion.	Ekyo kintu kirungi, mu ndowooza yange.
I really can’t wait for that!.	Mazima ddala ekyo siyinza kulinda!.
I’m almost there.	Nze kumpi ndi awo.
It doesn’t really matter.	Si kikulu nnyo.
What is that? 	Kiki ekyo?
Everyone says that.	Buli omu agamba bw’atyo.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
We absolutely have to do it.	Tulina ddala okukikola.
We were very close to getting that.	Ekyo twali kumpi nnyo okufuna.
And there is.	Era waliwo.
In reality this is not the case.	Mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
I had no idea what to expect.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku kye nnali nsuubira.
I thought very quickly.	Nalowooza mangu nnyo.
You can go to school.	Oyinza okugenda ku ssomero.
But no one knows it.	Naye tewali akimanyi.
In this case.	Mu mbeera eno.
No, it really is.	Nedda, ddala bwe kiri.
And there isn’t much time.	Era tewali budde bungi.
There really is.	Ddala waliwo.
Night in the city.	Ekiro mu kibuga.
I don’t like to talk about myself.	Sikyagala kwogera ku nze kennyini.
It’s not a problem or nothing.	Si kizibu oba tewali kintu kyonna.
It can be hard to know how to deal with this.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu okumanya engeri y’okukola ku nsonga eno.
Not here.	Si wano.
I know where they are at home.	Nze mmanyi gye bali awaka.
here it is.	wano we wali.
I have no problem with that.	Sirina buzibu ku nsonga eyo.
I was the one who was working.	Nze nnali nkola.
In everyone, in everything.	Mu buli muntu, mu buli kimu.
It’s the time.	Kye kiseera.
I wasn’t so sure.	Nze nali sikakasa nnyo.
He was my father.	Yali taata wange.
You will be my wife.	Ojja kuba mukyala wange.
He doesn’t need it at all.	Teyeetaaga n’akatono.
You can do it now.	Osobola okukikola kati.
You are as strong as he is.	Oli wa maanyi nga ye.
He said to do it together.	Yagambye okukikola nga bali wamu.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
Daily.	Buli lunaku.
I said no, just a little bit.	Nagamba nti nedda, katono ddala.
That’s not an opinion, that’s a fact.	Eyo si ndowooza, eyo mazima.
He knew this.	Kino yali akimanyi.
Not him, not now.	Si ye, si kati.
I can’t say anything about that, though.	Sisobola kwogera kintu kyonna ku ekyo, wadde.
He knew what you were doing.	Yali amanyi kye wali okola.
That’s how he came here.	Bwatyo bwe yajja wano.
However, this would be an ideal situation.	Kyokka, eno yandibadde mbeera nnungi nnyo.
This was not what it was.	Kino si kye kyali.
. . . .	.
As simple as that.	Nga kyangu nga ekyo.
He didn't really know why.	Mu butuufu yali tamanyi lwaki.
There is no time today.	Tewali budde leero.
He is still in school.	Akyali ku ssomero.
He was such a good father.	Yali taata mulungi bw’atyo.
However, this was not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kyali.
I might be able to do this.	Kino nnyinza okukikola.
He was on the floor.	Yali wansi.
That would be very dangerous.	Ekyo kyandibadde kya bulabe nnyo.
I want to be alone.	Njagala kubeera nzekka.
I need to do that.	Ekyo nneetaaga okukikola.
He would be there soon.	Yandibadde awo mu bbanga ttono.
That’s important to do.	Ekyo kikulu okukola.
But maybe it was.	Naye mpozzi bwe kyali.
It doesn’t matter what.	Kikulu si ki.
That’s the right thing to do.	Kye kituufu.
No one knows what it is.	Tewali amanyi kye kiri.
Pretty good, actually.	Kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
But it was the same.	Naye nga kye kimu.
He was very friendly with her.	Yali wa mukwano nnyo naye.
And yes, it was.	Era ye, bwe kyali.
I didn’t know how to live in that system.	Nnali simanyi ngeri ya kubeera mu nkola eyo.
But you are not a man.	Naye ggwe toli musajja.
He said nothing too complicated.	Yagambye nti tewali kintu kyonna kizibu nnyo.
Together in one.	Wamu mu kimu.
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kirungi.
And he started making money fast.	Era yatandika okukola ssente mu bwangu.
It was a difficult thing.	Kyali kizibu.
Not in his day and time.	Si mu lunaku lwe ne mu kiseera kye.
And he loves it.	Era ayagala nnyo.
But he didn’t need much time.	Naye yali teyeetaaga budde bungi.
Like who knew.	Nga ani yali amanyi.
Strong, but not overpowering.	Amaanyi, naye nga si wa maanyi nnyo.
Something for everyone.	Ekintu kya buli muntu.
I’m doing well.	Nkola bulungi.
He really wanted to go.	Yali ayagala nnyo okugenda.
The arrangement worked well.	Enteekateeka eyo yakola bulungi.
You’re there.	Ggwe oli awo.
He got food.	Yafuna emmere.
There is no answer.	Tewali kuddamu.
But they really aren’t.	Naye ddala si bwe bali.
It will be easier.	Kijja kuba kyangu.
I'm working on something like this right now.	Nze nkola ku kintu nga kino mu kiseera kino.
He is not real.	Si wa ddala.
I’m not sure yet.	Nze n’okutuusa kati.
I need to work.	Nze nneetaaga okukola.
This is not my job.	Guno si mulimu gwange.
He probably should have.	Oboolyawo yandibadde alina.
I can't work.	Sisobola kukola.
The other guy wasn’t interested.	Ggaayi omulala yali tayagala.
And they are very powerful.	Era ba maanyi nnyo.
There is no time.	Tewali budde.
I can’t say anything about it.	Siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
It seems to be true.	Kirabika nga kituufu.
The same goes for school.	Kye kimu ne ku ssomero.
Another might say that is not true.	Omulala ayinza okugamba nti ekyo si kituufu.
I’m sure you know that.	Nkakasa nti ekyo okimanyi.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
That's right, baby.	Ekyo kituufu mwana.
The same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu.
I feel at home.	Mpulira nga ndi waka.
Thought you would.	Yalowooza nti ojja kukikola.
He will.	Ajja ku...
A job for them.	Omulimu gye bali.
There is no time for that.	Tewali budde bwa kukola ekyo.
He must have had a reason.	Ateekwa okuba nga yalina ensonga.
I thought maybe you might as well .	Nalowooza nti osanga ne ggwe oyinza okuba nga .
Down to whatever.	Wansi ku kyonna.
He won’t be ready.	Tajja kuba mwetegefu.
But you just couldn’t do it.	Naye nga tosobola kukikola kyokka.
I have a reason why.	Nnina ensonga lwaki.
And that’s really a problem.	Era ekyo ddala kizibu.
He needed to know better.	Yali yeetaaga okumanya obulungi.
Now there is something.	Kati waliwo ekintu.
You can't go yet.	Tosobola kugenda n'okutuusa kati.
But not in this.	Naye si mu kino.
You don't know what he is.	Tomanyi ky'ali.
There is so much here.	Wano waliwo bingi nnyo.
And you think about.	Era olowooza ku.
Yeah, yeah.	Ye ye.
If he had.	Singa yalina.
He was his brother.	Yali muganda we.
That will be difficult.	Ekyo kijja kuba kizibu.
You can do what you want.	Osobola okukola ekyo ky’oyagala.
That's just being a nuisance.	Ekyo kuba kubeera kizibu kyokka.
He went to school.	Yagenda ku ssomero.
Here he is.	Wano w’ali.
He couldn’t have known this was bad.	Yali tayinza kumanya nti kino kibi.
I wanted to see if you were ready to go back to work.	Nnali njagala okulaba oba oli mwetegefu okudda ku mulimu.
Up to you.	Kiri eri gwe.
And he knew it.	Era yali amanyi.
We're going downstairs.	Tugenda wansi.
Very nice to see.	Kirungi nnyo okulaba.
I wasn’t sure there for a little while.	Nali sikakasa awo okumala akaseera katono.
However, he knew he wasn’t.	Kyokka yali akimanyi nti si bwe yali.
Everyone should be happy and cheerful.	Buli muntu alina okuba nga musanyufu era nga musanyufu.
Everyone will help.	Buli omu ajja kuyamba.
I knew we would.	Nnali nkimanyi nti tujja kukikola.
For that matter .	Ku nsonga eyo .
Indeed, let.	Mazima ddala, ka...
You will soon see that anyone.	Mu bbanga ttono ojja kulaba nti omuntu yenna.
That’s where he was.	Eyo gye yali.
I didn’t know where he was at any point.	Nnali simanyi gye yali mu kiseera kyonna.
Whether you like it or not isn’t the point.	Oba oyagala oba nedda si y’ensonga.
There is no plan.	Tewali nteekateeka yonna.
In the sense that.	Mu ngeri nti.
I have no plans and I feel good.	Sirina nteekateeka yonna era mpulira bulungi.
Everyone was busy.	Buli omu yali bbize.
I sure wish he would, you know.	Nkakasa njagala yandikoze, omanyi.
However, it is time to move on.	Kyokka, kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
I will never be the same.	Sijja kubeera nga bwe nnali.
I was doing a man’s job.	Nali nkola omulimu gwa musajja.
Everyone knows about this already.	Buli omu amanyi ku kino dda.
We are so close.	Tuli kumpi nnyo.
Like the person he was right now.	Nga omuntu gwe yali mu kiseera kino.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
I know where it is.	Nze mmanyi gye kiri.
You might have been, if you were me.	Oyinza okuba nga wali, singa wali nze.
Same thing, anyway.	Ekintu kye kimu, mu ngeri yonna.
He doesn't have it.	Talina.
I was his friend.	Nze nali mukwano gwe.
He was at work.	Yali ku mulimu.
He still couldn’t believe it.	Yali n’okutuusa kati yali tasobola kukkiriza.
Like his brother.	Nga muganda we.
That was a good movie.	Eyo yali firimu nnungi.
I knew what he was trying to do.	Nnali mmanyi kye yali agezaako okukola.
But he is not alone.	Naye si ye yekka.
He knew he was sick.	Yali akimanyi nti mulwadde.
Maybe he was already here.	Mpozzi nga yali wano dda.
This is going to be difficult.	Kino kigenda kuba kizibu.
There is nothing to gain.	Tewali kya kufuna.
What he was.	Kye yali.
Someone in that room did.	Waliwo omuntu mu kisenge ekyo bwe yakola.
However, I think it would be great.	Kyokka ndowooza nti kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
It’s a powerful thing.	Kintu kya maanyi.
What is it.	Kye ki...
There is another one.	Waliwo omulala.
We actually needed it.	Mu butuufu twali twetaaga.
This will not be easy.	Kino tekijja kuba kyangu.
What he had.	Kye yalina.
You you.	Ggwe ggwe.
He may be like now.	Ayinza okuba nga kati.
Or almost, anyway.	Oba kumpi, mu ngeri yonna.
If he had wanted to.	Singa yali ayagala.
All the time, actually.	Buli kiseera, mu butuufu.
This thing is the same.	Ekintu kino kye kimu.
He was asleep.	Yali yeebase.
No, not really, she said.	Nedda, tewali ddala, bwe yagamba.
It may be happening and it may be happening soon.	Kiyinza okuba nga kigenda mu maaso era kiyinza okuba nga kigenda mu maaso mu bbanga ttono.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I'll come to that now.	Nja kujja ku ekyo kati.
And there are so many.	Era waliwo bingi nnyo.
You have to be a dog, of course, that's the thing.	Olina okuba embwa, ddala, ekyo kye kintu.
Everyone said that.	Buli omu yagamba bw’atyo.
The book is excellent.	Ekitabo kirungi nnyo.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
And one can see why.	Era omuntu asobola okulaba lwaki.
I'll go downstairs.	Nja kugenda wansi.
You know this is dangerous.	Omanyi kino kya bulabe.
Now you know why.	Kati omanyi lwaki.
From there.	Okuva eyo.
There is a lot this week.	Waliwo bingi wiiki eno.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
Everyone knows this.	Kino buli omu akimanyi.
It could be tonight.	Kiyinza okuba ekiro kino.
Either way, not without help.	Mu ngeri yonna, si nga tewali buyambi.
He had a reason.	Yalina ensonga.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
Today I am me.	Leero nze nze.
That’s a good thing, actually.	Ekyo kintu kirungi, mu butuufu.
I hope you can help.	Nsuubira nti osobola okuyamba.
I know you do.	Nkimanyi nti okola.
That would be really bad.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi ddala.
This is currently not the case.	Kino mu kiseera kino si bwe kiri.
But maybe not a good idea.	Naye mpozzi si kirowoozo kirungi.
I couldn’t believe he would do something like that.	Nali siyinza kukkiriza nti yandikoze ekintu ng’ekyo.
That is what we can and must do today.	Ekyo kye tusobola era kye tulina okukola leero.
And you know what.	Era ggwe omanyi ki.
No woman speaks in the film.	Tewali mukyala yenna ayogera mu firimu eno.
But, well, someone might come back.	Naye, bulungi, omuntu ayinza okudda.
Not really about him.	Si ddala ku ye.
But in reality this is not the case.	Naye mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
It's just there.	Kiri awo kyokka.
It was like.	Yali nga.
I can’t do anything alone.	Sisobola kukola kintu kyonna nzekka.
On the day.	Ku lunaku.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
I couldn’t see anyone.	Nnali sisobola kulaba muntu yenna.
But in case you don’t.	Naye mu mbeera nga tolina.
It’s all us.	Byonna ffe.
You have no reason to be here now.	Tolina nsonga lwaki oli wano kati.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
Nobody.	Tewali muntu.
I didn’t know what he was doing there.	Nze nali simanyi kye yali akola eyo.
But it’s not anything.	Naye si kintu kyonna.
But that’s not the only problem.	Naye ekyo si kye kyokka ekizibu.
Me, you might say.	Nze, oyinza okugamba nti.
This is a real opportunity.	Guno mukisa gwa ddala.
He can’t get enough.	Tasobola kufuna kumala.
This is what.	Kino kye ki...
No plan really.	Tewali nteekateeka ddala.
We need to eat dinner.	Twetaaga okulya ekyeggulo.
That’s where we have it.	Eyo gye tulina.
But.	Naye.
I'm the one.	Nze ye.
This is actually not true.	Kino mu butuufu si kituufu.
Or at night as the case may be.	Oba ekiro nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
I don’t even know what to do with that.	Ekyo simanyi na kya kukikola.
A lot, maybe.	Bingi, mpozzi.
And it was pretty cool.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo.
And there he was.	Era awo we yali.
We have a lot of stuff like that.	Tulina ebintu bingi nga ebyo.
But someone has to say these things.	Naye waliwo alina okwogera ebintu bino.
I’m just a human being, you know.	Nze ndi muntu yekka, omanyi.
Not only that, everywhere.	Si ekyo kyokka, buli wamu.
He didn't know the answer.	Yali tamanyi kya kuddamu.
Everyone needs to help.	Buli muntu yeetaaga okuyamba.
I might be able to help.	Nnyinza okuyamba.
It would be a great place.	Kyandibadde kifo kirungi nnyo.
We will be best friends.	Tujja kuba ba mukwano nnyo.
This will happen.	Kino kijja kubaawo.
And he certainly wasn’t young.	Era ddala yali si muto.
But it was good.	Naye kyali kirungi.
But he won’t be able to stay here long.	Naye tajja kusobola kubeera wano bbanga ddene.
I really have no idea what is going on.	Mazima ddala sirina kirowoozo ku kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
And that’s soon enough.	Era ekyo mu bbanga ttono.
I can be anything.	Nsobola okuba ekintu kyonna.
Until this afternoon.	Okutuusa akawungeezi ka leero.
It was pretty good at that.	Kyali kirungi nnyo ku ekyo.
No issues at this point.	Tewali nsonga mu kiseera kino.
A good friend of mine has this problem.	Mukwano gwange omulungi alina ekizibu kino.
I have to talk about it.	Nnina okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
He didn’t want anything.	Yali talina ky’ayagala.
I don’t want to stay.	Saagala kusigala.
I'll do anything.	Nja kukola kyonna.
The police are coming.	Poliisi ejja.
It’s really very difficult.	Ddala kizibu nnyo.
Really.	Kituufu.
This is where the problem is for me.	Wano obuzibu we buli gyendi.
Good to see this.	Kirungi okulaba kino.
I said that’s not the case.	Nagamba nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
It’s hard for you to see that.	Kizibu gyoli okulaba ekyo.
That and that alone.	Ekyo era ekyo kyokka.
However, this is not the case here.	Kyokka wano si bwe kiri.
I knew it wasn’t what he wanted.	Namanya nti si kye yali ayagala.
The day of the.	Olunaku lwa...
And it was true.	Era kyali kituufu.
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kirungi.
Definitely not you think!.	Mazima ddala si ggwe olowooza!.
But he will do it.	Naye ajja kukikola.
You probably have a point.	Oboolyawo olina ensonga.
But I don’t quite know how to do it.	Naye simanyi bulungi ngeri ki gye nnyinza okukikola.
This is not about.	Kino si ku...
We have to help.	Tulina okuyamba.
But, it’s going on.	Naye, kigenda mu maaso.
That’s the reason why.	Eyo y’ensonga lwaki.
And there are so many.	Era waliwo bingi nnyo.
No one knew what could happen.	Tewali yali amanyi kiyinza kubaawo.
This is what he did.	Kino kye yakola.
He is right behind her.	Ali emabega we ddala.
Glad you’re okay.	Musanyufu nti oli bulungi.
I just do it and that's it.	Nze nkola kyokka era ekyo kye kiri.
You know me.	Omanyi nze.
I'm glad he did.	Ndi musanyufu nti yakikola.
You can easily shop.	Osobola bulungi okugula ebintu.
For us it was a very difficult time.	Ffe kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
I'm the reason why.	Nze ensonga lwaki...
That he wanted to have a party.	Nti yali ayagala kukola kabaga.
Things like that.	Ebintu nga ebyo.
I am happy to be doing my job.	Ndi musanyufu okuba nga nkola omulimu gwange.
Both are there, both are real.	Bombi bali awo, bombi ba ddala.
That was all he could do.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali asobola okukola.
He was lucky that way.	Yalina omukisa bw’atyo.
That won’t work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola.
I needed to make a plan.	Nnali nneetaaga okukola enteekateeka.
It’s not something like that.	Si kintu nga ekyo.
He wasn't going to last very long.	Yali tagenda kumala bbanga ddene nnyo.
Me and you.	Nze naawe.
He said he would talk to a friend.	Yagambye nti agenda kwogera ne mukwano gwe.
I knew he was in trouble.	Namanya nti yali mu buzibu.
We have to go home.	Tulina okudda eka.
Obviously this is not the case.	Kya lwatu kino si bwe kiri.
I don’t think we’re about that.	Sirowooza nti tuli ku nsonga eyo.
Or with us.	Oba naffe.
And that’s where he went.	Era awo we yagenda.
He said that.	Yayogera bw’atyo.
I can’t say why right now.	Siyinza kwogera lwaki mu kiseera kino.
He didn’t know what that could be.	Yali tamanyi ekyo kye kiyinza okuba.
And somewhere there.	Era waliwo we.
But it’s very difficult.	Naye nga kizibu nnyo.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
Not so much as it is.	Si nnyo nga bwe kiri.
Or he may not have.	Oba ayinza okuba nga talina.
I don’t know where to go.	Simanyi gye nnyinza kugenda.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
They certainly are.	Mazima ddala bwe bali.
Now he could do nothing right.	Kati yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna kituufu.
Tom, he thought.	Tom, bwe yalowooza.
And, for a while, he did too.	Era, okumala akaseera, naye yakikola.
It’s not a job.	Si mulimu.
Someone is talking to me.	Waliwo ayogera nange.
It was really absolutely true.	Ddala kyali kituufu ddala.
I will go myself.	Nze kennyini nja kugenda.
He was such a child.	Yali mwana bw’atyo.
He felt happy.	Yawulira nga musanyufu.
And maybe they were.	Era mpozzi nga baali.
You know this.	Kino okimanyi.
I love being here.	Njagala nnyo okubeera wano.
That's the whole point.	Eyo y'ensonga yonna.
Not right now, he said.	Si mu kiseera kino, bwe yagambye.
I really hoped it was my brother.	Nnali nsuubira nnyo nti muganda wange.
He did it.	Yakikola.
He didn't know why he had been so afraid.	Yali tamanyi lwaki abadde atya nnyo.
But it was wrong.	Naye kyali kibi.
You just know.	Ggwe omanyi kyokka.
I really don’t know what else to say.	Mazima ddala simanyi kya kwogera okusinga ekyo.
He knew he was sick, very sick.	Yali akimanyi nti mulwadde, mulwadde nnyo.
But in reality it is not.	Naye mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
Tonight we will keep going.	Ekiro kya leero tujja kusigala nga tugenda bulungi.
Today perhaps not.	Leero mpozzi si bwe kiri.
Maybe he did.	Mpozzi bwe yakola.
I'm not sure if this matters.	Sikakasa oba kino kikulu.
He is dangerous.	Ali wa bulabe.
But he is not alone.	Naye si ye yekka.
I loved it too.	Nange nnali njagala nnyo.
He really wanted to do it.	Yali ayagala nnyo okukikola.
He wanted to know.	Yali ayagala okumanya.
This will work.	Kino kijja kukola.
No, not quite right.	Nedda, si kituufu nnyo.
We’re just going to talk to a man.	Tugenda kwogera na musajja yekka.
He can do this.	Kino asobola okukikola.
But not today.	Naye si leero.
Now, it’s not.	Kati, si bwe kiri.
That’s what’s going to happen.	Ekyo kye kigenda okubaawo.
That might work.	Ekyo kiyinza okukola.
You might find something you like, as well.	Oyinza okufuna ekintu ky’oyagala, nga bwe kiri.
He is the best.	Ye asinga.
The image was more important than the substance.	Ekifaananyi kyali kikulu nnyo okusinga ekintu.
The book though.	Ekitabo wadde.
We have help there and we’ll be fine.	Tulina obuyambi eyo era tujja kuba bulungi.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
In this case, this will not matter.	Mu mbeera eno, kino tekijja kuba na nsonga.
I didn’t know you were in town.	Nnali simanyi nti oli mu kibuga.
How will he be.	Ajja kuba atya.
He's on to something.	Ali ku kintu.
Who knows though.	Ani amanyi wadde.
He didn’t want to eat.	Yali tayagala kulya.
That's all he is.	Oyo yekka ky'ali.
No man would do such a thing.	Tewali musajja yandikoze kintu ng’ekyo.
No one was in sight.	Tewali yali alabika.
We will do this.	Kino tujja kukikola.
And there’s a problem with that.	Era waliwo obuzibu ku ekyo.
He felt asleep.	Yawulira nga yeebase.
He is as good as anyone.	Mulungi nnyo nga omuntu yenna.
What we can actually do about the problem now.	Kye tusobola okukola mu butuufu ku kizibu kati.
You’re pretty good too.	Naawe oli mulungi nnyo.
I really don’t know what to do now.	Mazima ddala simanyi kya kukola kati.
Who knows, it could happen.	Ani amanyi, kiyinza okubaawo.
Down to nothing.	Wansi ku kintu kyonna.
We have to do it right.	Tulina okukikola obulungi.
I’m really excited to see where this goes.	Mazima ddala ndi musanyufu okulaba kino gye kigenda mu maaso.
He couldn’t get down.	Yali tasobola kufuna wansi.
He doesn’t want to go anywhere or do anything.	Tayagala kugenda yonna oba okukola ekintu kyonna.
He is a good father.	Ye taata mulungi.
He said you know that.	Yagambye nti ekyo okimanyi.
Not too much of it.	Si bingi nnyo.
It’s not exactly what’s happening.	Si kituufu ekigenda mu maaso.
I feel so much better now.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo kati.
I was with him every day.	Nali naye buli lunaku.
It won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo.
How do you do it.	Okola otya.
In this process.	Mu nkola eno.
We have to go.	Tulina okugenda.
He has to go.	Alina okugenda.
I want in the office.	Njagala mu ofiisi.
But you are.	Naye ggwe oli.
Very much indeed.	Bingi nnyo ddala.
It was very easy to do.	Kyali kyangu nnyo okukola.
He really wanted to win.	Yali ayagala nnyo ddala okuwangula.
I am going to want to know why.	Ngenda kwagala okumanya lwaki.
I feel so scared.	Mpulira nga ntya nnyo.
Not so with me.	Si bwe kiri ku nze.
I think it’s a great idea.	Ndowooza nti kirowoozo kya maanyi nnyo.
I think he's happy.	Ndowooza musanyufu.
He had so many things.	Yalina ebintu bingi nnyo.
And that is my problem.	Era ekyo kye kizibu kyange.
Obviously, that is very important.	Kya lwatu, ekyo kikulu nnyo.
Now he was safe.	Kati yali talina buzibu.
He can’t do this again.	Kino tasobola kuddamu kukikola.
Why why why.	Lwaki lwaki lwaki.
All right, that’s good.	Kirungi, ekyo kirungi.
But it’s very common.	Naye nga kya bulijjo nnyo.
Everyone is moving forward.	Buli omu agenda mu maaso.
But he was going to do it.	Naye yali agenda kukikola.
You don’t even know a friend.	Tomanyi na mukwano.
But it’s really true.	Naye ddala kituufu.
Everything would be fine.	Buli kimu kyandibadde kirungi.
He goes on and on.	Agenda mu maaso.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
I know he is only human.	Nkimanyi nti muntu yekka.
I feel so much better now.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo kati.
That’s not my fault.	Ekyo si kye kibi kyange.
More than anything, he didn’t want to answer.	Okusinga ekintu kyonna, yali tayagala kuddamu.
I was young, alone.	Nnali muto, nga ndi nzekka.
He is the only man.	Ye musajja yekka.
But it can help.	Naye kiyinza okuyamba.
Eating is a real problem.	Okulya kizibu kya ddala.
Nobody wanted to make money.	Tewali yali ayagala kukola ssente.
This was good to know.	Kino kyali kirungi okumanya.
You are .	Oli .
What? 	Kiki?
And that’s right.	Era ekyo kituufu.
And this is the problem.	Era kino kye kizibu.
But to be there.	Naye okubeera awo.
I didn’t think he was going to answer.	Nnali sirowooza nti yali agenda kuddamu.
This is the reason why.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki.
Now, he couldn't do that.	Kati, ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
He was terrified now.	Yali atya nnyo kati.
But not just now.	Naye si kati kyokka.
I just wanted to see the place again.	Nnali njagala kuddamu kulaba kifo ekyo kyokka.
He told me to go ahead.	Yang’amba okugenda mu maaso.
This is very dangerous.	Kino nga kya bulabe nnyo.
Not at all.	Si n’akatono.
I want to be together.	Njagala kubeera bombi.
I want to work again.	Njagala okuddamu okukola.
From the ground up, of course.	Okuva wansi, ddala.
I thought this was normal.	Nalowooza nti kino kyali kya bulijjo.
There are many reasons for this.	Waliwo ensonga nnyingi lwaki kino kiyinza okubaawo.
No one really knows everything though.	Tewali amanyi ddala buli kimu wadde.
Or, rather, not.	Oba, okusinga, si bwe kiri.
It's all me.	Byonna nze.
We have a lot of friendship.	Tulina nnyo mukwano.
It’s not really bad.	Si kibi ddala.
Daily.	Buli lunaku.
He was clearly unhappy.	Yalabika bulungi nti si musanyufu.
That’s not too bad.	Ekyo si kibi nnyo.
This is really good.	Kino ddala kirungi.
In fact it looks exactly the same as before.	Mu butuufu kirabika ddala nga bwe kyali emabegako.
Here, there is no one.	Wano, tewali muntu yenna.
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
He did what he said.	Yakola ekyo kye yayogera.
I can’t believe it.	Siyinza kukkiriza.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
I am human, same as everyone else.	Ndi muntu, kye kimu nga buli muntu omulala.
I wonder if you’ve been happy, or if you’re happy now.	Nze nneebuuza oba obadde musanyufu, oba oli musanyufu kati.
I’m sick of reading about it.	Nze ndi mulwadde okusoma ku nsonga eyo.
It comes and goes.	Kijja ne kigenda.
Definitely not very good.	Mazima ddala si kirungi nnyo.
It is, he said.	Kiri, bwe yagambye.
But not a huge amount of money.	Naye si ssente nnyingi nnyo.
I certainly don’t want to.	Mazima ddala saagala.
All those things.	Ebintu ebyo byonna.
I’m at home.	Nze ndi waka.
I don’t know if it’s true.	Simanyi oba kituufu.
I think faster than you.	Ndowooza mangu okusinga ggwe.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
I want to do it.	Njagala kukikola.
Maybe it’s nothing.	Mpozzi nga tewali kintu kyonna.
And you might not either.	Era naawe oyinza obutakola.
No one can believe it, he thought.	Tewali ayinza kukkiriza, bwe yalowooza.
Or that was just a general idea.	Oba ekyo kyali kirowoozo kya bulijjo.
I can’t see anything.	Nze sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
As it is, it is.	Nga bwe kiri nti.
He made money.	Yakola ssente.
We have to get out of here as fast as we can.	Tulina okuva wano mu bwangu nga bwe tusobola.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
He didn't know why and didn't need to know.	Yali tamanyi lwaki era nga teyeetaaga kumanya.
Even as he thought about it, though, he knew he had no choice.	Kyokka ne bwe yali alowooza ku ekyo, yali akimanyi nti yali talina kya kukola.
He obviously has trouble reading.	Kya lwatu nti alina obuzibu okusoma.
He couldn’t quite.	Yali tasobola bulungi.
That was the time it was.	Ekyo kye kiseera kye kyali.
This is good to see.	Kino kirungi okulaba.
He may have had a reason.	Ayinza okuba nga yalina ensonga.
I'll come with you.	Nja kujja naawe.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
She loved everything.	Yali ayagala nnyo buli kimu.
He has been working on this.	Abadde akola ku nsonga eno.
We can’t tell the truth now.	Tetusobola kwogera mazima kati.
Now that would be something.	Kati ekyo kyandibadde kintu.
We could see all those things.	Ebintu ebyo byonna twali tusobola okulaba.
This was actually happening.	Kino mu butuufu kyali kigenda mu maaso.
It’s hard to do that now.	Kizibu okukola ekyo kati.
I like something to continue.	Njagala nnyo ekintu okugenda mu maaso.
You're with me.	Oli nange.
He was the one.	Ye yali omu.
This is what he expected.	Kino kye yali asuubira.
We have a plan.	Tulina enteekateeka.
But there is another.	Naye waliwo omulala.
Not much.	Si bingi.
He and I are friends.	Nze naye tuli ba mukwano.
He lives here.	Abeera wano.
He knows the food.	Amanyi emmere.
Only this and the here and now.	Kino kyokka ne wano ne kati.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
We are both one.	Ffembi tuli kimu.
He said they are.	Yagambye nti bali...
I didn’t know what to do with him either.	Nange nnali simanyi kya kukola ku ye.
If for a little while.	Singa okumala akaseera katono.
Not here, nor there.	Si wano, wadde eyo.
I’m here to work.	Nze ndi wano okukola.
But not about this.	Naye si ku kino.
You don’t want to.	Ggwe toyagala.
This was easy for me.	Kino kyali kyangu gyendi.
He did what he could.	Yakola kye yali asobola.
He works alone.	Akola yekka.
Little by little.	Katono katono.
I hope anyone else does the same.	Nsuubira omuntu omulala yenna okukola kye kimu.
I guess you can’t do that.	Ntebereza nti ekyo tosobola kukikola.
You know he’ll want to spend time with us.	Omanyi ajja kwagala okumala naffe obudde.
This was not his plan.	Eno si ye yali enteekateeka ye.
It’s going to stay there for a little while.	Kigenda kusigala awo okumala akaseera katono.
I feel it too.	Nze nange mpulira.
? 	?
I needed money to get help.	Nnali nneetaaga ssente okufuna obuyambi.
But it’s just.	Naye kyokka.
It would be very difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
That’s a lot easier said than done, of course.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo okwogera okusinga okukola, ddala.
He has a plan for each of us.	Alina enteekateeka eri buli omu ku ffe.
He will be behind.	Ajja kuba emabega.
Or he is.	Oba ye.
He could see.	Yali asobola okulaba.
I think he is both.	Ndowooza ye bombi.
It was a good idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
I think you don’t have a good one.	Ndowooza tolina mulungi.
And that’s what he had been.	Era ekyo kye yali abadde.
But not in this.	Naye si mu kino.
It’s a lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi nnyo.
Now or nothing, he thought.	Kati oba tewali, bwe yalowooza.
It is true that they are.	Kituufu nti bwe bali.
I don’t know anything.	Sirina kye mmanyi.
This is a very dangerous issue.	Eno nsonga ya bulabe nnyo.
This is on me.	Kino kiri ku nze.
This is a bad thing.	Kino kibi.
Everything is fine as well.	Buli kimu kirungi nga bwe kiri.
And he knew that too.	Era yali akimanyi nti naye.
He was in trouble.	Yali mu buzibu.
This is not quite true.	Kino si kituufu nnyo.
I can see again, now.	Nsobola okuddamu okulaba, kati.
But he was in great shape.	Naye yali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
He had a plan.	Yalina enteekateeka.
He was what he was.	Yali ky’ali.
And he doesn’t want to go with me.	Era tayagala kugenda nange.
I had no idea where I was going.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi gye nnali ngenda.
We can’t go to the police.	Tetusobola kugenda ku poliisi.
That you were here.	Nti wali wano.
Nothing really bad or good.	Tewali ddala kibi oba kirungi.
He will see that you are with me.	Ajja kulaba nga oli nange.
But to you alone.	Naye eri ggwe wekka.
He is in the city.	Ali mu kibuga.
I’m not sure why, but it was sudden.	Sikakasa lwaki, naye kyali kya mangu.
However, this is not ideal.	Kyokka kino si kirungi nnyo.
And he was there.	Era yali awo.
I was sure he would agree.	Nali nkakasa nti ajja kukkiriza.
I feel better here.	Wano mpulira bulungi.
No help with that.	Tewali buyambi ku ekyo.
But he is here.	Naye ali wano.
Like he said he would.	Nga bwe yagamba nti ajja kukikola.
However, it can work.	Kyokka, kiyinza okukola.
He plans ahead of time.	Ateekateeka nga bukyali.
Clearly, he was not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe yali.
That was my problem.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
Just being with him.	Okubeera naye yekka.
That night.	Ekiro ekyo.
Now we were down to nothing.	Kati twali wansi okutuuka ku kintu kyonna.
And so are we.	Era naffe bwe tuli.
I think he must have.	Ndowooza alina okuba nga yalina.
He had been at a party.	Yali abadde ku kabaga.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
He’s going back to school.	Agenda kudda ku ssomero.
It was a sin.	Kyali kibi.
It’s not too fast.	Si kya mangu nnyo.
I don’t want to do this alone.	Kino saagala kukikola nzekka.
No one, he said.	Tewali muntu yenna, bwe yagambye.
And they are not.	Era si bwe bali.
He had it going on.	Yalina nga kigenda mu maaso.
You have it.	Ggwe olina.
Now it’s my turn, Dad.	Kati kye kiseera kyange taata.
Then there is no waiting.	Awo tewali kulinda.
He's on the floor.	Ali wansi.
It won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo.
Very very very very.	Ennyo nnyo nnyo.
I hear what you want.	Mpulira ky’oyagala.
Now we are alone.	Kati tuli ffekka.
I won’t stay long.	Sijja kumala bbanga ddene.
To do it.	Okukikola.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
It will be a good option for you.	Kijja kuba nkola nnungi gy’oli.
But this was home.	Naye eno yali waka.
Perhaps it is also true.	Oboolyawo era kituufu.
It’s going to be difficult.	Kigenda kuba kizibu.
I am alone in my house.	Nze ndi nzekka mu nnyumba yange.
I think he had.	Ndowooza yalina.
I just this .	Nze kino kyokka .
On here.	Ku wano.
It was just an idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kyokka.
But probably not.	Naye oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
No one knows the answer.	Tewali amanyi kya kuddamu.
You go to work.	Ogenda ku mulimu.
He was a human being.	Yali muntu.
In fact he wasn’t.	Mu butuufu si ye yali.
But it’s not good.	Naye si kirungi.
He thought of himself.	Yalowooza ku ye.
You don’t know why.	Tomanyi lwaki.
Like this and this.	Nga kino ne kino.
So far, pretty good, one might think.	Okutuuka wano, kirungi nnyo, omuntu ayinza okulowooza.
In no way could I do anything about it.	Mu ngeri yonna nnali sisobola kukikola kintu kyonna.
He goes on and on.	Agenda mu maaso.
Who should know about.	Ani alina okumanya ku...
Not everyone can or should be any one thing.	Si buli muntu nti asobola oba alina okuba ekintu kimu kyonna.
Here, he said.	Wano, bwe yagambye.
However, you know how it is.	Kyokka omanyi bwe kiri.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
And my wife.	Ne mukyala wange.
He can do it.	Asobola okukikola.
He can see again.	Asobola okuddamu okulaba.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
You will speak.	Ojja kwogera.
It’s not that issue.	Si nsonga eyo.
Or a lot of anything.	Oba bingi ku kintu kyonna.
It was my room.	Kyali kisenge kyange.
I am very, very sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo nnyo.
And it was this.	Era kyali kino.
Or anyone else.	Oba omuntu omulala yenna.
House in the city.	Ennyumba mu kibuga.
No, he said.	Nedda, bwe yagambye.
He is better than us.	Asinga ffe.
And that he didn’t want to.	Era nti yali tayagala.
We have no idea what the situation is for them.	Tetulina kirowoozo ku mbeera ki gye bali.
He always had something to do.	Bulijjo yalina ky’alina okukola.
It’s not luck.	Si mukisa.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
No one said too much.	Tewali yayogera bingi nnyo.
From him.	Okuva ku ye.
It would be very dangerous.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe nnyo.
This was going to work.	Kino kyali kigenda kukola.
I have no idea what the problem is.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku buzibu bwe buli.
He loves these things.	Ayagala nnyo ebintu bino.
And it was a good thing he did.	Era kyali kirungi kye yakola.
I couldn’t see much from my position.	Nnali sisobola kulaba bingi okuva mu kifo kye nnali nfunye.
They’re really on to something here.	Ddala bali ku kintu wano.
None of that now.	Tewali kintu kyonna ku ekyo kati.
That’s perfectly normal.	Ekyo kya bulijjo ddala.
I have to think.	Nnina okulowooza.
I’m sorry that’s just not the case.	Nsonyiwa nti si bwe kiri kyokka.
He wants, he wants.	Ayagala, ayagala.
from.	okuva.
That was difficult, very difficult.	Ekyo kyali kizibu, kizibu nnyo.
It had to be here.	Kyalina okuba wano.
No man does.	Tewali musajja yenna akola.
Everything mostly looks good.	Buli kimu okusinga kirabika bulungi.
He is a human being.	Ye muntu.
Or maybe he did.	Oba oboolyawo yakikola.
He couldn't do this now.	Kino yali tasobola kukikola kati.
He thinks this is a good thing.	Alowooza nti kino kintu kirungi.
Maybe it was like that.	Mpozzi nga bwe kyali.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Mpozzi enkya ekiro.
And it was absolutely true.	Era kyali kituufu ddala.
And it won’t happen.	Era tekijja kubaawo.
Anyone could say anything.	Omuntu yenna yali asobola okwogera ekintu kyonna.
Now he was nobody, nothing.	Kati yali talina muntu yenna, nga talina kintu kyonna.
It is not difficult to talk to him about it.	Si kizibu okugenda kwogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
And he wanted things.	Era nga ayagala ebintu.
Not like me.	Si nga nze.
Every kid wants a phone.	Buli mwana ayagala essimu.
Now, it’s the weekend.	Kati, ye wiikendi.
But it’s going to happen again tonight.	Naye kigenda kuddamu okubaawo ekiro kino.
It will be the same.	Kijja kuba kye kimu.
And it is the time.	Era kye kiseera.
There is no answer now.	Tewali kuddamu kati.
It was very, very good.	Kyali kirungi nnyo nnyo.
Well.	Bulungi.
No one is working hard.	Tewali akola nnyo.
He had been young.	Yali abadde muto.
It’s not about making money.	Si kya kukola ssente.
That was close, very close.	Ekyo kyali kumpi, kumpi nnyo.
I’m at home.	Nze ndi waka.
He hoped she would stay.	Yalina essuubi nti ajja kusigala awo.
Anyone would, he thought.	Omuntu yenna yandikoze, bwe yalowooza.
Very good now.	Kirungi nnyo kati.
On doing it.	Ku kukikola.
I don’t want to go.	Saagala kugenda.
Currently there is no space.	Mu kiseera kino tewali kifo.
I hear the police.	Mpulira poliisi.
I knew that pretty well.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi bulungi bulungi.
That is my opinion.	Ekyo kye ndowooza yange.
I said maybe.	Nagamba mpozzi.
Tom would be happy to have her.	Tom yandibadde musanyufu okubeera naye.
It’s not really bad.	Si kibi ddala.
Everyone knew this.	Kino buli omu yali akimanyi.
He is effective and efficient.	Akola bulungi era akola bulungi.
I will be there.	Nja kubeerawo.
At the time he was ill.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali mulwadde.
It looks really hard right now.	Kirabika ddala kizibu mu kiseera kino.
I don’t even know why.	Simanyi na lwaki.
He told me that.	Yang’amba nti.
I had no idea about this.	Kino nnali sirina kye mmanyi.
There is nothing for you right now.	Tewali kintu kyonna gy’oli mu kiseera kino.
Maybe he's beautiful.	Mpozzi nga mulungi.
Perhaps he did.	Oboolyawo yakikola.
So far, nothing too good.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali kirungi nnyo.
a.	omu.
That this is what it is.	Nti kino kye kiri.
Everyone says that.	Buli omu agamba bw’atyo.
I’ll know it’s you.	Nja kumanya nti ggwe.
You have to go.	Olina okugenda.
You’re here for him.	Oli wano lwa ye.
Maybe not today.	Mpozzi si leero.
But it’s going on.	Naye kigenda mu maaso.
We can do it.	Tusobola okukikola.
I have nothing to say about this.	Kino sirina kye nnyinza kwogera.
Anything can happen.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo.
To get to this place.	Okutuuka mu kifo kino.
However, it would be so many things.	Kyokka, kyandibadde ebintu bingi nnyo.
That’s unusual for me.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo gyendi.
In fact, he was.	Mu butuufu yali.
And that was terrible.	Era ekyo kyali kibi nnyo.
I’m sure you’ll agree.	Nkakasa nti ojja kukkiriza.
He needed time.	Yali yeetaaga obudde.
To get to this place.	Okutuuka mu kifo kino.
Why was this happening? 	Lwaki kino kyali kigenda mu maaso?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
No luck so far.	Tewali mukisa okutuusa kati.
He knew it.	Yali akimanyi.
He can’t go to them.	Tasobola kugenda gye bali.
I think that’s pretty cool.	Ndowooza ekyo kirungi nnyo.
That might, actually.	Ekyo kiyinza, mu butuufu.
I have had the same problem.	Nze nfunye ekizibu kye kimu.
But you know what it is.	Naye omanyi kye kiri.
That was what this was.	Ekyo kye kyali kino.
But he does well.	Naye akola bulungi.
There was someone else there that night.	Waliwo omuntu omulala awo ekiro ekyo.
He loves to watch.	Ayagala nnyo okulaba.
Just one night.	Ekiro kimu kyokka.
He is a good man who knows his job.	Musajja mulungi amanyi omulimu gwe.
We need to do it quickly.	Tulina okukikola mu bwangu.
He wanted to talk again.	Yali ayagala okuddamu okwogera.
He was every man’s friend.	Yali mukwano gwa buli musajja.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
That’s what he would do.	Ekyo kye yandikoze.
I don’t think so.	Sirowooza nti.
Always, always, always.	Bulijjo, bulijjo, bulijjo.
I won’t go well.	Sijja kugenda bulungi.
I will do it again.	Nja kuddamu okukikola.
I thought we were in good shape.	Nalowooza nti tuli mu mbeera nnungi.
But he was the one.	Naye ye yali.
It was finished.	Yali ewedde.
I was in the front.	Nze nnali mu maaso.
I can’t let that happen.	Ekyo sisobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
A dog, perhaps.	Embwa, mpozzi.
But we are.	Naye ffe.
I’m not there.	Nze siri awo.
I loved that house.	Ennyumba eyo nnali njagala nnyo.
No one had a chance to be there.	Tewali yalina mukisa gwa kubeerawo.
It seems so normal.	Kirabika nga kya bulijjo nnyo.
This is what he has to do.	Kino alina okukola.
I know he would work.	Nkimanyi nti yandikoze.
It will be hard, but we can do it.	Kijja kuba kizibu naye tusobola okukikola.
But who knows.	Naye ani amanyi.
It was a very difficult time for me.	Kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo gyendi.
I certainly am.	Mazima ddala ndi.
I guess this was it.	Ntebereza nti kino kye kyali.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Simanyi kigenda kubaawo.
There is a problem.	Waliwo obuzibu.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
Now, it won’t happen.	Kati, tekijja kubaawo.
We’re fine so far.	Tuli bulungi okutuusa kati.
I’m not sure that.	Nze sikakasa nti.
It’s not, it’s not the way it is for us.	Si bwe kiri, si ngeri gye kiri gye tuli.
Everyone in their own way.	Buli omu mu ngeri ye.
That seems to be going well actually.	Ekyo kirabika kigenda bulungi mu butuufu.
He is not happy.	Si musanyufu.
Which he wouldn’t say.	Kye kyali tagenda kwogera.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
Or perhaps he could.	Oba oboolyawo yali asobola.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
And the movie.	Ne firimu.
Mention...	Okwogera ku...
For a moment he couldn't believe it.	Okumala akaseera nga tasobola kukkiriza.
So far, no response.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali kuddamu.
That’s not luck.	Ekyo si mukisa.
That's why he's coming.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki ajja.
I really didn’t know what to say.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kwogera.
But he wanted to go home.	Naye yali ayagala kudda waka.
There is no place.	Tewali kifo.
You will be happy.	Ojja kuba musanyufu.
But it’s a house.	Naye nga nnyumba.
No, it's not.	Nedda, nedda.
In practice, however, it is not so easy.	Kyokka mu nkola, si kyangu nnyo.
Who knew what was going on.	Ani yali amanyi ekigenda mu maaso.
I certainly hope you can.	Mazima ddala nsuubira nti osobola.
But that is not the case today.	Naye leero si bwe kiri.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
Forward.	Mu maaso.
You knew it, too.	Naawe wali okimanyi.
He can get another one.	Asobola okufuna omulala.
You don’t know.	Tomanyi.
But it’s in the future.	Naye kiri mu maaso.
But that was all he had to say.	Naye ekyo yalina okwogera kyokka.
All of this is neither here nor there.	Bino byonna si wano wadde wali.
It’s going to be great.	Kigenda kuba kirungi nnyo.
However, I want to.	Kyokka, njagala.
Something like the picture below.	Ekintu nga ekifaananyi wansi.
One and only.	Omu era yekka.
They are with me.	Bali nange.
It’s not my issue.	Si nsonga yange.
He was like another father to me.	Yali nga taata omulala gyendi.
I can’t believe it.	Siyinza kukkiriza.
And you can do it too.	Era naawe osobola okukikola.
We needed to be safe.	Twali twetaaga okuba nga tetulina bulabe.
Everything we need to know.	Buli kye twetaaga okumanya.
Not just his wife.	Si mukyala we yekka.
It’s not my thing.	Si kintu kyange.
He can do a lot more than that.	Asobola okukola bingi okusinga ekyo.
This is very powerful.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo.
All he wants is his job.	Kye ayagala gwe mulimu gwe.
This is very low.	Kino kya wansi nnyo.
This was not what it was.	Kino si kye kyali.
He was going to do it.	Yali agenda kukikola.
As it was the case.	Nga bwe kyali.
And nobody does this.	Era kino tewali akikola.
Here is a picture.	Wano waliwo ekifaananyi.
He really knew what he was thinking.	Ddala yali amanyi kye yali alowooza.
That's his thing.	Ekyo kye kintu kye.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
I wasn’t sure about what, but it was real.	Nnali sikakasa ku kiki, naye kyali kya ddala.
Very soon now, someone is coming.	Mu bbanga ttono nnyo kati, waliwo ajja.
He thinks he is better than either of us.	Alowooza nti asinga omu ku ffe.
I really need to do this.	Kino nneetaaga nnyo okukikola.
That can be difficult to do.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kizibu okukola.
He wants to talk to you.	Ayagala kwogera naawe.
I have something I have.	Nnina ekintu kye nnina.
We cannot know why.	Tetusobola kumanya nsonga lwaki.
However, it is not a problem.	Kyokka, si kya buzibu.
He is such an ordinary man.	Ye musajja wa bulijjo bw’atyo.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
It will come in time.	Kijja kujja mu kiseera.
We were always friends.	Bulijjo twali ba mukwano.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ekyo tewali kibi kyonna.
In fact, he didn’t want to play at all.	Mu butuufu yali tayagala kuzannya n’akatono.
I love it, love it, love it.	Njagala nnyo, njagala nnyo, njagala nnyo.
What we are.	Bye tuli.
Nothing wrong there.	Tewali kibi kyonna awo.
Or even this afternoon.	Oba wadde akawungeezi ka leero.
I was happy to do it.	Nnali musanyufu okukikola.
And that's my point now.	Era eyo y'ensonga yange kati.
You are a strong person.	Oli muntu wa maanyi.
It was quick.	Yali ya mangu.
I love my father.	Njagala taata wange.
I know that very well.	Ekyo nkimanyi nnyo.
You are really beautiful.	Ddala oli mulungi nnyo.
I'm working on the process now.	Nze nkola ku nkola kati.
And he was doing it.	Era yali akikola.
However, that was it.	Kyokka, ekyo kye kyali.
I think it’s very important.	Ndowooza kikulu nnyo.
Both are with us now.	Bombi tuli naffe kati.
As always, we’ll see.	Nga bulijjo, tujja kulaba.
He had no idea.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna.
But that would be very difficult.	Naye ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
He didn’t like it very much.	Yali tayagala nnyo.
And he was very happy.	Era nga musanyufu nnyo.
That’s good and bad.	Ekyo kirungi era kibi.
We just have to allow faith.	Tulina kumala kukkiriza kukkiriza.
In fact, we are not.	Mu butuufu si bwe tuli.
She would have to talk to him.	Yandibadde alina okwogera naye.
Nothing really serious though.	Tewali kintu kya maanyi ddala wadde.
I have nothing with me.	Sirina kintu kyonna nange.
I’m just going to stay home.	Nze ngenda kusigala waka kyokka.
You’re coming with us.	Ojja naffe.
You are his friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwe.
He did that quickly.	Ekyo yakikola mangu.
That was the problem.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
I was ready for that.	Ekyo nnali mwetegefu.
Looks like you're in.	Kirabika oli mu.
Take a picture.	Kuba ekifaananyi.
It wasn’t his thing.	Si kye kyali ekintu kye yali akola.
That’s where we’re going.	Eyo gye tugenda.
Not too much, though.	Kyokka si bingi nnyo.
It was ordinary.	Kyali kya bulijjo.
He would have already, if he had wanted to.	Yandibadde dda, singa yali ayagala.
But he can’t.	Naye tasobola.
But he doesn’t need to work.	Naye teyeetaaga kukola.
Not good, he thought.	Si mulungi, bwe yalowooza.
That was me, now.	Oyo nnali nze, kati.
But despite myself .	Naye wadde nga nze kennyini .
And you will do it.	Era ojja kukikola.
I was ready.	Nnali mwetegefu.
But she had no children.	Naye yali talina mwana.
They certainly were.	Mazima ddala baali.
He has been a blessing.	Abadde mukisa.
It was a lot, it was a lot.	Yali nnyingi, yali nnyingi.
There is nothing we can do.	Tetulina kye tusobola kukola.
In fact, it isn’t.	Mu butuufu, si bwe kiri.
You should go too.	Naawe wandibadde ogenda.
You’re already way ahead.	Obadde dda mu maaso nnyo.
I would say not at all.	Nze n’agamba nti si bwe kiri n’akatono.
Of course, that's me, he thought.	Kya lwatu, oyo nze, bwe yalowooza.
Perhaps his brother did too.	Oboolyawo ne muganda we naye yakikola.
That’s where it really was.	Eyo gye kyali ddala.
This is where he wanted to be right now.	Wano we yali ayagala okubeera mu kiseera kino.
You want so much more.	Oyagala bingi nnyo.
His friend was nowhere to be seen.	Mukwano gwe yali talina we yali alabika.
However, he is definitely ready to get home.	Kyokka mazima ddala mwetegefu okutuuka awaka.
I’ll be home for the weekend soon.	Nja kudda waka ku wiikendi mu bbanga ttono.
It’s going to be a beautiful thing.	Kigenda kuba kintu kirungi nnyo.
He looked very strong.	Yalabika nga wa maanyi nnyo.
This seems to be true.	Kino kirabika nga kituufu.
My father was one.	Taata yali omu.
He felt comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi.
I was thinking about my father.	Nali ndowooza ku taata.
He won’t know.	Tajja kumanya.
He obviously couldn’t.	Kya lwatu nti yali tasobola.
Me, too.	Nange, nange.
This is a normal room.	Kino kisenge kya bulijjo.
However, he tried anyway.	Kyokka, yagezaako mu ngeri yonna.
He was a man like himself.	Yali muntu nga ye.
It was very real.	Kyali kya ddala nnyo.
He felt really happy now.	Yawulira nga musanyufu ddala kati.
It doesn’t really belong to anyone.	Mu butuufu si wa muntu yenna.
I love how it looks now.	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kirabika kati.
A good father.	Taata omulungi.
Not much here.	Si bingi wano.
But this was a problem.	Naye kino kyali kizibu.
But there is help.	Naye waliwo obuyambi.
A friend of my father’s.	Mukwano gwa taata wange.
And the guy.	Ne ggaayi.
You’re not ready.	Toli mwetegefu.
But it seems to be the case.	Naye kirabika nga bwe kiri.
Not very good to do.	Si kirungi nnyo kukola.
No one needs to see the movie.	Tewali yeetaaga kulaba firimu.
It’s in the city.	Kiri mu kibuga.
It was my favorite moment.	Kyali kiseera kye nnali njagala ennyo.
This was not where he wanted to be.	Wano si we yali ayagala okubeera.
He had, in a sense.	Yalina, mu ngeri emu.
It is not the case here.	Wano si bwe kiri.
As a friend of mine	Nga mukwano gwange .
There is nothing wrong with that.	Tewali kizibu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
That’s how he could.	Bw’atyo bwe yali asobola.
But he was quick.	Naye yali wa bwangu.
Anyone but ourselves.	Omuntu yenna okuggyako ffe kennyini.
I know, she thought.	Nkimanyi, bwe yalowooza.
You know, you don’t even have to do this.	Omanyi kino tolina na kukikola.
He is still in prison.	Akyali mu kkomera.
But she was a really lovely woman.	Naye yali mukyala ayagala nnyo ddala.
I’m sure it would be.	Nkakasa nti kyandibadde.
He wanted someone else.	Yali ayagala omuntu omulala.
Same as before.	Kye kimu nga bwe kyali emabegako.
This is a quick one.	Eno ya mangu.
I plan to go to the office today.	Nteekateeka kugenda mu ofiisi leero.
That there is beauty.	Nti waliwo obulungi.
My father was very sick.	Taata yali mulwadde nnyo.
I really wanted these.	Bino nnali njagala nnyo.
We all come, we all go.	Ffenna tujja, ffenna tugenda.
I might have known it.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnali nkimanyi.
I can’t do that again.	Ekyo sisobola kuddamu kukikola.
But it will be good.	Naye kijja kuba kirungi.
No one saw anything of the sort.	Tewali yalaba kintu kyonna kya ngeri eyo.
So far, no problems.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali buzibu.
I have it now.	Nnina kati.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
Everyone is here, in the same place.	Buli omu ali wano, mu kifo kye kimu.
He was my son.	Yali mwana wange.
I have to get back to my work.	Nnina okudda ku mulimu gwange.
But this can be a problem.	Naye kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
He had to go now.	Yalina okugenda kati.
Not everyone is like that.	Si buli muntu nti bw’atyo.
He was ready.	Yali mwetegefu.
And the job he did!.	Era omulimu gwe yakola!.
And maybe .	Era mpozzi .
What you always wanted.	Kye wali oyagala bulijjo.
It was a city.	Kyali kibuga.
But you, well .	Naye ggwe, bulungi .
And no one won’t.	Era tewali muntu yenna tajja kukikola.
That’s the point.	Eyo nsonga.
This is not true at all.	Kino si kituufu n’akatono.
Someone else already said that.	Omuntu omulala yayogera dda ebyo.
Not a chance for that, of course.	Si mukisa gwa ekyo, ddala.
No system whatsoever.	Tewali nkola yonna mu ngeri yonna.
It is not one and the same.	Si kimu era kye kimu.
We don’t have that attitude.	Tetulina ndowooza eyo.
But that wasn’t the movie he wanted to make.	Naye eyo si ye firimu gye yali ayagala okukola.
And it may be true.	Era kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
This morning .	Enkya ya leero .
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kirungi.
He talks a lot.	Ayogera nnyo.
On each side.	Ku buli ludda.
I always wanted to be home, all the time.	Bulijjo nnali njagala nnyo okubeera awaka, buli kiseera.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
Now I can’t talk to you.	Kati sisobola kwogera naawe.
He worked with her.	Yakola naye.
Someone is in the room with me.	Waliwo ali mu kisenge nange.
This was his favorite thing.	Kino kye kyali ekintu kye yali ayagala ennyo.
I have to move on.	Nnina okugenda mu maaso.
Even to himself perhaps.	Ne ku ye kennyini mpozzi.
And yet that’s what he would have to do.	Era naye ekyo kye yandibadde alina okukola.
I want so many things.	Njagala ebintu bingi nnyo.
It’s bad and it’s real.	Kibi era nga kya ddala.
That's you?.	Oyo ggwe?.
It doesn’t matter who says what.	Si nsonga ani ayogera ki.
And, he knew he had to do it fast.	Era, yali akimanyi nti alina okukikola amangu.
Which he had to do.	Kye yalina okukola.
No one needs to know.	Tewali yeetaaga kumanya.
Almost in spite of myself.	Kumpi wadde nga nze kennyini.
He saw everything himself.	Yalaba buli kimu ye kennyini.
But it won’t be enough.	Naye tekijja kumala.
Maybe we were.	Mpozzi nga twali.
I think that’s really something.	Ndowooza ekyo ddala kintu.
He didn’t want to do it.	Yali tayagala kukikola.
If you would .	Bwe wandibadde .
It had to be all or nothing.	Kyalina okuba nga kyonna oba nga tewali.
There is a picture.	Waliwo ekifaananyi.
I'm working.	Nze nkola.
They were there in large numbers.	Baali eyo mu bungi.
We will continue as usual.	Tugenda kugenda mu maaso nga bulijjo.
And it’s true, they were.	Era kituufu, baali.
It’s not easy to do.	Si kyangu kukikola.
He doesn’t have a car.	Talina mmotoka.
You are not in any trouble.	Toli mu buzibu bwonna.
He is in the hospital here.	Ali mu ddwaaliro wano.
I want to be a guy.	Njagala kubeera ggaayi.
He is what he is.	Ye ky’ali.
Just as he expected.	Nga bwe yali asuubira.
And it’s not exactly like that.	Era si bwe kiri ddala.
You are absolutely.	Oli ddala.
I feel scared.	Mpulira nga ntya.
And it’s very important.	Era kikulu nnyo.
That’s what I expected.	Ekyo nnali nsuubira.
I could do that now, you know.	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola kati, omanyi.
It could be a lot.	Kiyinza okuba nga bingi.
Very little now.	Katono ddala kati.
In the manufacturing process.	Mu nkola y’okukola ebintu.
Nothing normal, like.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo, nga.
He is not from here.	Si wa wano.
Not one penny.	Si ssente emu.
This was going to happen quickly.	Kino kyali kigenda kubaawo mu bwangu.
I always think everyone knew this.	Bulijjo ndowooza nti kino buli omu yali akimanyi.
But you don’t have to.	Naye tolina kukikola.
But in reality this is not the case.	Naye mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
Not about everything, but certainly about him.	Si ku buli kimu, naye mazima ddala ku ye.
Apparently you can do anything.	Kirabika osobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
I think the same today.	Nze ndowooza kye kimu ne leero.
Has to buy absolutely.	Alina okugula ddala.
Everything is going to be fine.	Buli kimu kigenda kuba bulungi.
But it’s difficult.	Naye kizibu.
For what reason? 	Ku lwa ki?
I might reconsider this.	Nnyinza okuddamu okulowooza ku kino.
You want to make a watch.	Oyagala kukola ssaawa.
Call here in the morning.	Kuba wano ku makya.
I don’t even know who.	Simanyi na ani.
And that’s not all.	Era ekyo si kye kyokka.
I knew nothing about all this myself.	Nze kennyini nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku bino byonna.
I absolutely have that.	Ekyo nnina ddala.
I hope this is not the case.	Nsuubira nti kino si bwe kiri.
Stuff, not so much.	Ebintu, si bingi nnyo.
But this is not the issue here.	Naye eno si y’ensonga wano.
I thought it was true.	Nalowooza nti kituufu.
And indeed, it was.	Era ddala, bwe kyali.
Now he needs to get to work.	Kati yeetaaga okutuuka ku mulimu.
I knew my father.	Taata nnali mmanyi.
She has been very beautiful.	Abadde alabika bulungi nnyo.
Just you and me.	Nze naawe ffekka.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
He was all ready.	Yenna yali mwetegefu.
I guess, you know how to do this.	Ntebereza, kino omanyi okukola.
This alone comes in many forms.	Kino kyokka kijja mu ngeri nnyingi.
It was a good feeling.	Yali mpulira nnungi.
I’m lucky and you don’t have time.	Nnina omukisa era tolina budde.
He couldn't say exactly why.	Yali tasobola kwogera bulungi lwaki.
He hoped he did.	Yalina essuubi nti yakikola.
Good, not bad.	Kirungi, si kibi.
She has always loved beauty.	Obulungi bulijjo abadde ayagala nnyo.
That’s what my client did here.	Ekyo omuntu wange kye yakola wano.
That either or, that or or.	Nti oba oba, nti oba oba.
Or so he thought.	Oba bw’atyo bwe yalowooza.
The food is excellent.	Emmere nnungi nnyo.
But my car .	Naye mmotoka yange .
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
This is my point.	Eno y’ensonga yange.
Everything was in perfect condition.	Buli kimu kyali mu mbeera nnungi.
I’m going to be a father.	Ngenda kubeera taata.
But all this is a way.	Naye bino byonna ngeri.
Lucky to have this opportunity.	Omukisa okufuna omukisa guno.
Probably not.	Oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
I'll make one, but I don't know when.	Nja kukola emu naye simanyi ddi.
It’s totally up to you what you are.	Kiri ddala gy’oli ki gy’oli.
Of course it had to happen.	Kya lwatu kyalina okubaawo.
He didn’t have a single one.	Yali talina wadde emu.
He is a good reason to see this.	Ye nsonga nnungi okulaba kino.
It will be much harder than that.	Kijja kuba kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He's finished anyway.	Amaze mu ngeri yonna.
There is no substitute for this.	Tewali kiyinza kudda mu kifo kya kino.
You can do this in many ways.	Kino osobola okukikola mu ngeri nnyingi.
But he's fine, apparently.	Naye ali bulungi, kirabika.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
You know, it’s not me, it’s us.	Ggwe omanyi, si nze, ffe.
I'll be back tomorrow morning.	Nja kudda enkya ku makya.
But that's my point.	Naye eyo y'ensonga yange.
But, of course, that’s nothing.	Naye, ddala, ekyo si kintu kyonna.
But you don’t have three.	Naye tolina ssatu.
I know you want to.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala.
He wants everything to be easier faster than.	Ayagala buli kimu kyangu mangu okusinga.
He works all the time.	Akola buli kiseera.
Good, you know.	Kirungi, omanyi.
This had to work.	Kino kyalina okukola.
Not for my son.	Si lwa mwana wange.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
You will see how it looks in this movie.	Ojja kulaba engeri gye kirabika mu firimu eno.
And that was a problem.	Era ekyo kyali kizibu.
But it is very powerful.	Naye nga kya maanyi nnyo.
No, it’s not that.	Nedda, si ekyo.
Now he was home.	Kati yali waka.
And that’s a problem.	Era ekyo kizibu.
Indeed, this seems to be the case.	Mazima ddala, kino kirabika bwe kiri.
That seems to be true.	Ekyo kirabika nga kituufu.
Basically, there is no time.	Okusinga, tewali budde.
It was his time now .	Yali kiseera kye kati .
Thinking about you.	Nga olowooza ku ggwe.
I need to address this.	Kino nneetaaga okukola ku nsonga eno.
We were all there.	Ffenna twali awo.
Getting the money.	Okufuna ssente.
He looked asleep but maybe not.	Yalabika nga yeebase naye mpozzi nedda.
The backlash continues.	Okudda emabega kugenda mu maaso.
This is it, he thought.	Kino kye kiri, bwe yalowooza.
Today, however, there is hope.	Kyokka, leero waliwo essuubi.
I still don’t know today.	N’okutuusa leero simanyi.
Or even harmless.	Oba wadde nga tewali bulabe.
Maybe he thought he was safe.	Mpozzi yalowooza nti talina bulabe.
And that’s a problem.	Era ekyo kizibu.
Maybe he doesn’t have a girlfriend now.	Mpozzi nga kati talina muganzi we.
In fact, his problem is his wife.	Mu butuufu ekizibu kye ye mukyala we.
Everyone needs one.	Buli muntu yeetaaga emu.
Or the attitude.	Oba endowooza.
This was not what he wanted.	Kino si kye yali ayagala.
We need to drive.	Twetaaga okuvuga.
He has been that good to me.	Abadde mulungi bw’atyo gyendi.
He is better than us.	Asinga ffe.
That’s what everyone wants.	Ekyo buli omu ayagala.
He thinks it is very important.	Alowooza nti kikulu nnyo.
That will come in time.	Ekyo kijja kujja mu budde.
He knew this was wrong.	Yali akimanyi nti kino kyali kibi.
And he was there.	Era yali awo.
Another friend was at her wedding.	Mukwano gwange omulala yali ku mbaga ye.
But in reality, he is powerless now.	Naye mu butuufu, kati talina maanyi.
That seems to be true.	Ekyo kirabika nga kituufu.
This he felt was too dangerous.	Kino yawulira nti kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
Nothing comes close.	Tewali kintu kyonna kijja kumpi.
However, this does not seem to be true in practice.	Kyokka kino kirabika si kituufu mu nkola.
And one can see why he says that.	Era omuntu asobola okulaba lwaki ayogera bw’atyo.
Almost anything you want.	Kumpi ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala.
And, apparently, it was a good move.	Era, kirabika, yali nkola nnungi.
I am like him.	Nze ndi nga ye.
In the sky.	Mu bbanga.
He thought of everything.	Yalowooza ku buli kimu.
Not bad.	Si kibi.
No one spoke to me.	Tewali yayogera nange.
We are going to do this.	Kino tugenda kukikola.
With luck he will get one.	Nga alina omukisa ajja kufuna emu.
Everything was very, very difficult.	Buli kimu kyali kizibu nnyo, nga kizibu nnyo.
No one did that either.	Ekyo era tewali yakikola.
It’s not real though.	Si kya ddala wadde.
It’s good for them.	Kirungi gye bali.
I knew he knew that too.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi nti naye yali akimanyi.
He had to get out of this.	Yalina okuva mu kino.
That is not true.	Ekyo si kya mazima.
Perhaps he was all of those things.	Oboolyawo ye yali ebintu ebyo byonna.
You can’t do this for that person.	Kino tosobola kukikola ku lwa muntu oyo.
Good to know.	Kirungi okumanya.
He was curious, too.	Yali ayagala okumanya, era.
I am a real woman.	Ndi mukyala ddala.
Each of us.	Buli omu ku ffe.
It could be anyone here.	Kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna wano.
Maybe it's the same.	Mpozzi nga bwe kiri.
That seems normal.	Ekyo kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
He is very dangerous.	Ali wa bulabe nnyo.
Now everyone loves it.	Kati buli omu ayagala nnyo.
And this is wrong.	Era kino kibi.
It’s really nothing.	Mu butuufu si kintu kyonna.
He was that good to me.	Yali mulungi gyendi bw’atyo.
And that he will be back soon.	Era nti ajja kudda mangu.
I have no idea about that.	Ekyo sirina kye mmanyi.
But he couldn’t eat properly.	Naye yali tasobola kulya bulungi.
Forward, always forward.	Mu maaso, bulijjo mu maaso.
He would be too busy to talk.	Yandibadde bbize nnyo nga tasobola kwogera.
One on one is a problem.	Omu ku omu kizibu.
This is not an opinion.	Eno si ndowooza.
Even he on his own.	Wadde ye ku ye.
I know what it is.	Nze mmanyi kiki.
He was doing well.	Yali akola bulungi.
That’s pretty simple.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo kyangu.
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
Probably no one will.	Oboolyawo tewali ajja kukikola.
I know you have to.	Nkimanyi nti olina.
As it happened, he was in the quickest of the two.	Nga bwe kyali, yali mu bwangu okusinga bombi.
But it was always almost time.	Naye bulijjo kumpi kyali kiseera.
I can’t let it happen again.	Siyinza kukkiriza kuddamu kubaawo.
You seem to have a problem.	Olabika olina ekizibu.
It had to be something.	Kyalina okuba ekintu.
Not that, please not that! 	Si ekyo, nsaba si ekyo!
. . . .	.
French as a child.	Olufaransa nga akyali mwana muto.
This is where he needs to be.	Wano we yeetaaga okubeera.
I don’t have his luck.	Nze sirina mukisa gwe.
We can have plenty of time for that.	Ekyo tusobola okufuna obudde bungi.
No luck today.	Tewali mukisa leero.
Very good though.	Kirungi nnyo wadde.
I love spending time with him.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye obudde.
But not in this case.	Naye si mu mbeera eno.
I still don’t know if we can do it.	N’okutuusa kati simanyi oba tusobola okukikola.
That’s the point.	Eyo y’ensonga.
He is alone.	Ali yekka.
And it’s very important.	Era kikulu nnyo.
There is no reason to be so afraid.	Tewali nsonga lwaki otya nnyo.
I didn’t know he could do that.	Ekyo nnali simanyi nti asobola okukikola.
He certainly cannot in his position.	Mazima ddala tasobola mu kifo kye.
I can’t do anything.	Sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
I have that too.	Ekyo nange nnina.
He doesn’t like my opinion.	Tayagala ndowooza yange.
He is very strong.	Ali wa maanyi nnyo.
That you want to be.	Nti oyagala okubeera.
That’s good to know.	Ekyo kirungi okumanya.
He is a good man in every way.	Musajja mulungi mu buli kimu.
You know why you’re here.	Omanyi lwaki oli wano.
He was fast asleep.	Yali yeebase nnyo.
But it is the only thing we can do.	Naye kye kintu kyokka kye tusobola okukola.
Take a picture.	Kuba ekifaananyi.
Book, book, book.	Ekitabo, ekitabo, ekitabo.
I could barely eat.	Nnali nsobola bulungi okulya.
But this is not all.	Naye bino si bye byonna.
Which he was, in a way.	Kye yali, mu ngeri emu.
Since I didn’t have a girlfriend.	Okuva lwe nnali talina muganzi.
He knew no man would.	Yali akimanyi nti tewali musajja yandikoze.
You're not even there.	Toli wadde awo.
This is not the place.	Kino si kye kifo.
I need to work on this.	Nnina okukola ku kino.
What, he said.	Kiki, bwe yagambye.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
And there are so many of them.	Era nga bingi nnyo.
You don’t have to do this.	Kino tolina kukikola.
We always will, actually.	Bulijjo tujja kukikola, mu butuufu.
He said he has.	Yagambye nti alina...
But he was nothing of the sort.	Naye yali si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
However, not at the same time.	Kyokka si mu kiseera kye kimu.
I just need you.	Nze nneetaaga ggwe wekka.
But they are fast friends.	Naye ba mukwano gwa mangu.
Maybe he still was.	Mpozzi nga yali akyali.
It’s just hard to say.	Kizibu kyokka okwogera.
He doesn’t like it very much.	Tayagala nnyo.
I didn’t know who it was.	Nnali simanyi ani.
You know it.	Okimanyi.
Definitely not very good.	Mazima ddala si kirungi nnyo.
It would be difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu.
In his own way.	Mu ngeri ye.
I’ve been working.	Mbadde nkola.
But he couldn’t do that.	Naye ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
It was my issue.	Yali nsonga yange.
He was happy.	Yali musanyufu.
However, this is simply not true.	Kyokka, kino si kituufu kyokka.
I thought you loved it.	Nnalowooza nti oyagala nnyo.
My father always said that time is money.	Taata bulijjo yagamba nti obudde bwa ssente.
He’s still not local.	N’okutuusa kati si wa wano.
I am the only one who is like me.	Nze nzekka nga nze.
It is here in us.	Kiri wano mu ffe.
No one has, but someone does.	Tewali muntu yenna alina, naye waliwo akola.
It’s easy for you to talk.	Kyangu gy’oli okwogera.
Probably not here.	Oboolyawo si wano.
He knew my father.	Yali amanyi taata wange.
This is not a big deal.	Kino si kintu kikulu nnyo.
About three.	Nga ssatu.
You know that better than I do.	Ekyo ggwe okimanyi okusinga nze.
I can't speak.	Sisobola kwogera.
It was definitely something he could do.	Mazima ddala kyali kintu kye yali asobola okukola.
He had been a good man.	Yali abadde musajja mulungi.
But he wasn’t.	Naye ye si bwe yali.
And you do it.	Era ggwe okola.
Nothing wrong with that.	Tewali kibi kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
No, he didn't need one, he said.	Nedda, yali teyeetaaga emu, bwe yagambye.
He as good as he told me so.	Ye nga mulungi nga bwe yang’amba bw’atyo.
And that will be that.	Era ekyo kijja kuba ekyo.
There is no such issue.	Tewali nsonga eyo.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
We can’t stay here now.	Tetusobola kusigala wano kati.
My point was this.	Ensonga yange yali eno.
And he's really pretty.	Era ddala mulungi nnyo.
That just wasn’t the case.	Ekyo kyokka si bwe kyali.
The point is this.	Ensonga eri nti eno.
It doesn’t matter what it is.	Si kikulu ki kye kiri.
This is very real and very immediate.	Kino kya ddala nnyo era kya mangu nnyo.
We cannot accept this fact.	Ensonga eno tetusobola kukkiriza.
I don’t want to talk about him anymore.	Saagala kuddamu kwogera ku ye.
He talked to everyone and was very friendly.	Yayogera ne buli muntu era nga wa mukwano nnyo.
He could see why.	Yali asobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
Now is a good time.	Kati kiseera kirungi.
I thought you didn’t know he would actually do it.	Nalowooza nti tomanyi nti ddala ajja kukikola.
There went my night.	Eyo gye yagenda ekiro kyange.
Same with my wife.	Kye kimu ne mukyala wange.
That doesn’t seem to be true.	Ekyo kirabika si kituufu.
And you know that.	Era ekyo okimanyi.
He probably doesn’t think it’s that time.	Oboolyawo talowooza nti kye kiseera ekyo.
However, in my case it was not.	Kyokka mu mbeera yange si bwe kyali.
But if he did.	Naye singa yakikola.
It’s not time to go back.	Si kye kiseera okudda emabega.
But we were very lucky.	Naye twali ba mukisa nnyo.
I feel good, really.	Mpulira bulungi, ddala.
This was very dangerous, but he didn’t need long.	Kino kyali kya bulabe nnyo, naye nga teyeetaaga bbanga ddene.
Mostly in the evening.	Okusinga akawungeezi.
You don’t have to wait long.	Tolina kulinda bbanga ddene.
He had it.	Yali alina.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
Like right now.	Nga kati kati.
He certainly won’t go anywhere now.	Mazima ddala tajja kugenda yonna kati.
It can help move forward.	Kiyinza okuyamba okugenda mu maaso.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu nga ekyo.
It seems a little awkward.	Kirabika nga kizibu katono.
Everything seems to be going great.	Buli kimu kirabika kigenda bulungi nnyo.
We need to talk to you.	Twetaaga okwogera naawe.
And there we were.	Era awo we twali.
It was a very important one.	Kyali kikulu nnyo.
Indeed, it is.	Mazima ddala, bwe kiri.
He had no one.	Yali talina muntu yenna.
Or, perhaps they were.	Oba, oboolyawo baali.
I have no idea why it is even there.	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki kiri ne awo.
That’s absolutely real.	Ekyo kya ddala ddala.
But I don't have time.	Kyokka sirina budde.
And yet he is not in the same position in theory.	Era naye mu ndowooza tali mu kifo kye kimu.
I have no idea why.	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki.
It would be difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu.
It can get really, really fast.	Kiyinza okufuna amangu ddala, amangu ddala.
Going to jail was bad.	Okugenda mu kkomera kyali kibi.
That will do it.	Ekyo kijja kukikola.
He is a really nice person.	Ye muntu mulungi ddala.
He had to go to work.	Yalina okugenda ku mulimu.
I certainly hope they are not.	Mazima ddala nsuubira nti si bwe bali.
That’s just not true.	Ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
I need to be ready.	Nze nneetaaga okuba nga mwetegefu.
This was very common.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo nnyo.
And he is sick.	Era mulwadde.
We all have it.	Ffenna tulina.
It’s not true for me.	Si kituufu ku nze.
In fact, it was quite common.	Mu butuufu, kyali kya bulijjo nnyo.
He didn’t have time.	Yali talina budde.
Now everything was fine.	Kati buli kimu kyali kirungi.
Not a doctor, actually.	Si musawo, mu butuufu.
Here it was.	Wano we kyali.
In my opinion, that’s what he should have done.	Mu ndowooza yange, ekyo kye yandibadde akola.
And then nothing.	Era awo tewali kintu kyonna.
He didn’t know exactly.	Yali tamanyi bulungi.
And that was good.	Era ekyo kyali kirungi.
No problem there for me.	Tewali buzibu awo gyendi.
Good to have you here.	Kirungi okubeera naawe wano.
I have the same problem.	Nnina ekizibu kye kimu.
But he was probably asleep.	Naye osanga yali yeebase.
He wasn't even thinking that.	Yali talowooza wadde ekyo.
That’s what’s happening now.	Ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso kati.
She didn't want to talk to him about anything.	Yali tayagala kwogera naye ku kintu kyonna.
We don’t have time.	Tetulina budde.
I am a teacher.	Ndi musomesa.
This is absolutely true.	Kino kituufu ddala.
He said it probably would be this week.	Yagambye nti osanga kyandibadde wiiki eno.
No problem, yet.	Tewali buzibu, n’okutuusa kati.
But not too many.	Naye si bingi nnyo.
Or so he must have thought.	Oba bw’atyo ateekwa okuba nga yalowooza.
It was a very difficult night.	Ekiro kyali kizibu nnyo.
He was a strong man.	Yali musajja wa maanyi.
I was actually pretty good to myself.	Mu butuufu nnali mulungi nnyo gyendi.
He was doing it to me.	Yali akikola ku nze.
I can get this to work no problem.	Nsobola okufuna kino okukola tewali buzibu.
You probably need to think for a moment.	Oboolyawo olina okulowooza okumala akaseera.
Why are you here.	Lwaki oli wano.
This is the crux of the problem.	Kino kye kikulu ennyo mu kizibu kino.
Nothing...	Tewali...
Good job.	Omulimu mulungi.
No one knows about it.	Tewali akimanyi.
I don’t have a boyfriend.	Sirina muganzi gwe nnina.
He is here to help.	Ali wano okuyamba.
I’m doing the same thing.	Nze nkola ekintu kye kimu.
Dealing with this issue is not critical.	Okukola ku nsonga eno si kikulu nnyo.
I’m not one for parties.	Siri omu ku mbaga.
You have to do this yourself.	Kino olina okukikola wekka.
He is going to love this.	Kino agenda kwagala nnyo.
But that is not the case at all.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
Very, very good work.	Omulimu mulungi nnyo nnyo.
Like, tomorrow, though.	Nga, enkya, wadde.
He is very sick.	Mulwadde nnyo.
He wasn’t going to do it.	Yali tagenda kukikola.
More than ever.	Okusinga bwe kyali.
Now I'll see what happens.	Kati nja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
But it is very difficult.	Naye kizibu nnyo.
That’s all there is for now.	Ekyo kyokka kye kiri kati.
He is happy to be alone.	Musanyufu okubeera yekka.
He lives here.	Abeera wano.
I am very lucky.	Ndi wa mukisa nnyo.
We are not the power.	Si ffe amaanyi.
I won’t always be there.	Sijja kubeerawo bulijjo.
He himself felt asleep.	Ye kennyini yawulira nga yeebase.
But therein lies the problem.	Naye awo we wali ekizibu.
And then he was asleep.	Era awo yali yeebase.
I don't know exactly.	Nze simanyi bulungi.
I don’t think so.	Sirowooza nti.
But it was my party too.	Naye nange yali mbaga yange.
You just have to think of something and it appears.	Olina okulowooza ku kintu kyokka ne kirabika.
Very good, very happy.	Kirungi nnyo, musanyufu nnyo.
Where we are going.	Gye tugenda.
He wanted to stay for a very long time.	Yali ayagala okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
That’s what he wanted.	Ekyo yali ayagala.
He had to do it himself.	Yalina okukikola ye kennyini.
I love that you want that too.	Njagala nnyo nti naawe ekyo oyagala.
There is no reason.	Tewali nsonga yonna.
No one could see.	Tewali yali asobola kulaba.
And he didn’t need to.	Era yali teyeetaaga.
There, he said.	Eyo, bwe yagambye.
But he didn’t want to preach, or he couldn’t talk.	Naye yali tayagala kubuulira, oba nga tasobola kwogera.
And of course we can’t .	Era ddala tetusobola .
No one's been here yet.	Tewali muntu yenna abadde wano n'okutuusa kati.
It’s in the office.	Eri mu ofiisi.
He is better than that.	Asinga ekyo.
He's there.	Ali awo.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Tewali kizibu kyonna ku nsonga eno.
And he knew he couldn't let that happen.	Era yali akimanyi nti ekyo tayinza kukkiriza kubaawo.
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tayinza kukkiriza.
It’s not like going home.	Si nga okudda eka.
You think it would be easy, but it's not.	Olowooza kyandibadde kyangu naye si bwe kiri.
But he was beautiful.	Naye yali alabika bulungi.
Will try anything.	Ajja kugezaako ekintu kyonna.
And now, that seems to be true.	Era kati, ekyo kirabika nga kituufu.
It was pretty busy.	Yali nnungi nnyo nga bbize.
Maybe it was always time.	Mpozzi bulijjo kyali kiseera.
She is a very happy woman.	Mukyala musanyufu nnyo.
He couldn’t really talk.	Yali tasobola kwogera ddala.
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
No one knows, he is the best.	Tewali amanyi, ye asinga byonna.
Everything goes.	Buli kimu kigenda.
Not much though.	Si nnyo wadde.
It is very difficult to be in the hospital.	Kizibu nnyo okubeera mu ddwaaliro.
Of course, he wasn't really sick.	Kya lwatu nti mu butuufu yali si mulwadde.
I have no idea what to do.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kya kukola.
But not this morning.	Naye si enkya ya leero.
And this is actually not true.	Era kino mu butuufu si kituufu.
I really didn’t want to.	Mazima ddala nnali saagala.
This is a great movie for everyone.	Eno firimu nnungi nnyo eri buli muntu.
He can't speak.	Tasobola kwogera.
But it’s true.	Naye kituufu.
But it’s a good idea.	Naye kirowoozo kirungi.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
I feel very happy.	Mpulira nga ndi musanyufu nnyo.
I don’t really like that.	Ekyo sikyagala nnyo.
Definitely a good idea.	Mazima ddala kirowoozo kirungi.
I hope it is the same for me.	Nsuubira nti nange bwe kiri.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
He will be with us soon.	Ajja kubeera naffe mu bbanga ttono.
I love only you, and I always have.	Njagala ggwe wekka, era njagala nnyo bulijjo.
He did this at the same time.	Kino yakikola mu kiseera kye kimu.
And you have no problem doing so.	Era tolina buzibu bwonna mu kukikola.
No, he himself.	Nedda, ye kennyini.
He would be in the front.	Yandibadde mu maaso.
She said she didn’t need a man.	Yagambye nti teyeetaaga musajja.
I was young.	Nnali muto.
Not much, he thought.	Si bingi, bwe yalowooza.
Nothing can happen.	Tewali kiyinza kubaawo.
He thought that was pretty cool.	Yalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
He was done today.	Yali amaze leero.
That's a bad thing.	Ekyo kibi.
I strongly think not.	Nze nnyo ndowooza nti si bwe kiri.
He appeared to be .	Yalabika nga .
I'll do anything.	Nja kukola kyonna.
You were there.	Ggwe wali.
Nothing seems more obvious than that.	Tewali kirabika nga kya lwatu okusinga ekyo.
He had been for a long time.	Yali amaze ebbanga ddene.
That is not always the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri bulijjo.
Sorry .	Nsonyiwa .
It would be much easier that way.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo mu ngeri eyo.
He certainly had none himself.	Mazima ddala ye kennyini yali talina.
But of course that’s not true at all.	Naye ddala ekyo si kituufu n’akatono.
No one was downstairs.	Tewali muntu yenna yali wansi.
It’s nothing of the sort.	Si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
My father had nothing like that going on.	Taata yali talina kintu nga ekyo kigenda mu maaso.
It’s in the room.	Kiri mu kisenge.
He knew, he thought.	Yali amanyi, bwe yalowooza.
You might, you know.	Oyinza, omanyi.
However, it was a practical challenge.	Kyokka, kyali kizibu nnyo mu nkola.
In my case, that was a huge problem.	Mu mbeera yange, ekyo kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
He will speak shortly.	Ajja kwogera mu bbanga ttono.
Only one did it.	Omu yekka ye yakikola.
I think you are a good man.	Ndowooza oli musajja mulungi.
There is no space.	Tewali kifo kyonna.
It is very early in the evening.	Buli bukyali nnyo akawungeezi.
I have to do it.	Nnina okukikola.
I just need a little time.	Nze nneetaaga akaseera katono.
And it could happen again tonight.	Era kiyinza okuddamu okubaawo ekiro kino.
But he is in trouble.	Naye ali mu buzibu.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Certainly, we don’t.	Mazima ddala, tetulina.
How can you.	Oyinza otya.
I don’t think he will.	Sirowooza nti ajja kukikola.
He wasn’t young.	Yali si muto.
He is my everything.	Ye buli kimu kyange.
Eating alone tonight.	Okulya wekka ekiro kino.
He knew anyway.	Yali amanyi mu ngeri yonna.
Not that it really mattered.	Si nti kyali kikulu nnyo.
He was at one, too.	Yali ku emu, naye.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Kyokka, si kikulu.
What they are.	Kye bali.
It’s going to be fine now.	Kigenda kuba bulungi kati.
Good job on this one!.	Omulimu omulungi ku guno!.
He can talk as he would like.	Asobola okwogera nga bwe yandiyagadde.
Of course, no one had any idea.	Kya lwatu nti tewali muntu yenna yalina kirowoozo kyonna.
This is his position.	Kino kye kifo kye.
I’m not a good singer at all.	Siri muyimbi mulungi n’akatono.
Nothing really important.	Tewali kikulu nnyo.
Any image you want to make.	Ekifaananyi kyonna ky’oyagala okukola.
We’re going to the hospital.	Tugenda mu ddwaaliro.
Not myself.	Si nze kennyini.
Everyone has a reason.	Buli muntu alina ensonga.
I want you as my wife.	Njagala ggwe nga mukyala wange.
Not in this case.	Si mu mbeera eno.
It seems realistic.	Kirabika nga kya ddala.
Now, maybe that’s a good thing.	Kati, mpozzi ekyo kintu kirungi.
That's what's down here now.	Ekyo kye kiri wansi wano kati.
No one knows anything about it.	Tewali amanyi kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
He looks like.	Alabika nga...
However, we shall see.	Kyokka, tujja kulaba.
Really, almost anything will do.	Ddala, kumpi ekintu kyonna kijja kukola.
And it was a good thing.	Era kyali kintu kirungi.
We have to leave this place now.	Tulina okuva mu kifo kino kati.
We’ll see where this goes.	Tujja kulaba kino gye kigenda.
And that’s exactly what it is.	Era ekyo ddala kye kiri.
I will always know where it is.	Nja kumanya gye kiri bulijjo.
It can be very difficult.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
Let me assume that .	Ka ndowooza nti .
You can do that too.	Ekyo naawe oyinza okukikola.
I don’t know, but maybe you do.	Simanyi naye mpozzi ggwe omanyi.
A very nice guy.	Ggaayi omulungi ennyo.
He works really hard.	Akola nnyo ddala.
But he had to do it.	Naye yalina okukikola.
Returning home.	Okudda eka.
I could barely speak.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kwogera.
Dad is going to do a great job.	Taata agenda kukola omulimu gwa maanyi nnyo.
That’s how you were.	Bw’atyo bwe wali.
Being on point.	Okubeera ku nsonga.
No, not you, though.	Nedda, si ggwe, wadde.
I want to see that city.	Njagala kulaba kibuga ekyo.
He does everything on time.	Buli kimu akikola mu budde.
But this was normal.	Naye kino kyali kya bulijjo.
No one knows where he went or why.	Tewali amanyi gye yagenda oba lwaki.
It’s very good for you.	Kirungi nnyo gy’oli.
That’s normal for me though.	Ekyo kya bulijjo gyendi wadde.
I’m so scared.	Ntya nnyo.
And even when we were .	Era ne bwe twali .
But he did it well.	Naye yakikola bulungi.
He couldn’t talk to her.	Yali tasobola kwogera naye.
it is not the case.	si bwe kiri.
But we can know that it will happen.	Naye tusobola okumanya nti kijja kubaawo.
But it’s not anything.	Naye si kintu kyonna.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
You have .	Olina .
And he said he didn’t know why.	Era yagamba nti tamanyi lwaki.
Maybe not much though.	Mpozzi si bingi wadde.
. . . .	.
You can get help.	Osobola okufuna obuyambi.
He was a lucky man and he knew it.	Yali musajja wa mukisa era yali akimanyi.
They always are.	Bulijjo bwe bali.
We don’t have time.	Tetulina budde.
He was in excellent shape.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
From the	Okuva mu .
And she looked good.	Era nga alabika bulungi.
I’m not going anywhere with him.	Sirina gye ngenda naye.
But there was nothing.	Naye nga tewali.
When he spoke.	Bwe yayogera.
He saw something in me.	Yalaba ekintu mu nze.
He always liked to do things at night.	Bulijjo yali ayagala nnyo okukola ebintu ekiro.
I know you want to help.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala kuyamba.
It can only come back to you.	Kiyinza okudda gy’oli kyokka.
It’s difficult.	Kizibu.
What is it now? 	Kati kiki?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
That’s a bad idea .	Ekyo kirowoozo kibi .
It doesn't matter what.	Si kikulu kya kiki.
It seems to be a good one.	Kirabika nga kirungi.
There is beauty in everything.	Mu buli kimu mulimu obulungi.
He works alone.	Akola yekka.
And also one was ahead.	Era era emu yali mu maaso.
I hope we will do it.	Nsuubira nti tujja kukikola.
But that’s where we are.	Naye awo we tuli.
I want to be there for everything.	Njagala kubeerawo ku buli kimu.
You can help.	Osobola okuyamba.
It will never happen again.	Tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
I’m going with him, Dad.	Ngenda naye taata.
Not everyone wants everyone all the time.	Si buli muntu nti buli muntu ayagala buli kiseera.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
That was the hope, anyway.	Ekyo kye kyali essuubi, mu ngeri yonna.
It was home.	Yali waka.
This is always true.	Kino kituufu bulijjo.
I've been thinking about it a lot.	Mbadde ndowooza nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
I was very unhappy.	Nnali nnyo si musanyufu.
Really with you.	Ddala naawe.
At the time, he had no reason to do what was right.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali talina nsonga lwaki akola kituufu.
No, no, no and no.	Nedda, nedda, nedda era nedda.
I have to get to them.	Nnina okutuuka gye bali.
It’s not good for anyone.	Si kirungi eri omuntu yenna.
As it is .	Nga bwe kiri nti .
It was just him.	Yali ye yekka.
You knew that.	Ekyo wali okimanyi.
But you will get something.	Naye ojja kufuna ekintu.
I couldn’t believe it.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza.
If only he knew.	Singa yali amanyi.
However, it always seems to work out.	Kyokka bulijjo kirabika kigenda bulungi.
And tomorrow would be exactly the same.	Era enkya yandibadde kye kimu ddala.
Someone will come.	Waliwo ajja kujja.
Every room, every space.	Buli kisenge, buli kifo.
Don't go there.	Togenda eyo.
As always, alone.	Nga bulijjo, yekka.
Everything will come in time.	Buli kimu kijja kujja mu budde.
It’s just something, a moment.	Kintu kyokka, akaseera katono.
That’s just not me.	Ekyo kyokka si nze.
You already have a problem.	Olina dda ekizibu.
I love being here.	Njagala nnyo okuba wano.
It was a very difficult time.	Kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
He is dealing with it.	Akola ku nsonga eyo.
He is a very nice guy.	Ye ggaayi omulungi ennyo.
He tried to think.	Yagezaako okulowooza.
That’s all I really wanted.	Ekyo kyokka kye nnali njagala ennyo.
Not this office.	Si ofiisi eno.
No one seems to know what that would be.	Alabika tewali amanyi ekyo kye kyandibadde.
I think he could do it.	Ndowooza yali asobola okukikola.
How easy it is! 	Nga kyangu nnyo!
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
We are very much.	Ffe tuli nnyo.
He knew what he would have to do today.	Yali amanyi kye yandibadde alina okukola leero.
He knew he wasn’t.	Yali akimanyi nti si bwe yali.
The problem is me.	Obuzibu nze.
I think that will do.	Ndowooza ekyo kijja kukola.
I am this child.	Nze nali mwana oyo.
He looked dangerous.	Yalabika nga wa bulabe.
And perhaps he could.	Era oboolyawo yali asobola.
Easy, isn’t it .	Kyangu, si bwe kiri .
It’s not hard to do.	Si kizibu kukola.
He wasn’t friendly.	Yali si wa mukwano.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
It was a very important one.	Kyali kikulu nnyo.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
Now you’re there.	Kati oli awo.
He’s still the same.	Akyali bw’atyo.
He will be behind.	Ajja kuba emabega.
There is no way.	Tewali ngeri yonna.
He didn’t want any trouble.	Yali tayagala buzibu bwonna.
However, I have a problem.	Kyokka nnina ekizibu.
There is no power.	Tewali maanyi.
I'm not entirely sure about that.	Sikakasa ddala ku ekyo.
We can only do what we can do.	Tusobola okukola ekyo kyokka kye tusobola okukola.
I wish he was here.	Njagala yandibadde wano.
None of this in that case.	Tewali kino mu mbeera eyo.
He certainly would.	Mazima ddala yandikoze.
He saw his opportunity.	Yalaba omukisa gwe.
It is very important to do so.	Kikulu nnyo okukikola.
Like he knew it would.	Nga bwe yali akimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
It would be dangerous.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe.
It’s what we all were.	Kye twali ffenna.
It would be .	Kyandibadde .
He has to know.	Alina okumanya.
He didn’t quite know what to do.	Yali tamanyi bulungi kya kukola.
I am ready to move on.	Ndi mwetegefu okugenda mu maaso.
There is no good way.	Tewali ngeri nnungi.
I’m not entirely sure.	Sikakasa ddala.
However, we will try.	Kyokka, tujja kugezaako.
He had to see like we have.	Yalina okulaba nga ffe bwe tulina.
I feel like you can get anything here.	Mpulira nga wano osobola okufuna ekintu kyonna.
Perhaps that was true.	Oboolyawo ekyo kyali kituufu.
He wasn't very good at it, though.	Kyokka yali si mulungi nnyo mu nsonga eyo.
A short drive from town.	Okuvuga akaseera katono okuva mu kibuga.
But nothing of the sort.	Naye tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo.
We are a small school.	Tuli ssomero ttono.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
I should have done it already.	Nnali nsaanidde okukikola dda.
At this point no one was in sight.	Mu kiseera kino tewali yali alabika.
He likes to go home early in the evening.	Ayagala nnyo okudda eka nga bukyali akawungeezi.
He always says that.	Bulijjo ayogera bw’atyo.
Not much, really.	Si nnyo, ddala.
That is his son	Oyo ye mwana we .
He said they were both.	Yagambye nti bali bombi.
At the time, though, it looked good.	Kyokka mu kiseera ekyo kyali kirabika bulungi.
Strong and athletic.	Amaanyi era nga muzannyi wa kuzannya.
I have no issue with this.	Sirina nsonga yonna ku nsonga eno.
And, this is true.	Era, kino kituufu.
Which is not the case.	Kye si bwe kiri.
And of course this is very difficult.	Era ddala kino kizibu nnyo.
He is a very busy man.	Ye musajja bbize nnyo.
I am not myself myself.	Nze kennyini siri nze kennyini.
Or act immediately.	Oba okukola amangu ddala.
But that's why you're here.	Naye y'ensonga lwaki oli wano.
He didn't like it this way.	Yali tayagala nnyo mu ngeri eno.
He may be .	Ayinza okuba nga .
He has a good job.	Alina omulimu omulungi.
That someone here desperately needed help.	Nti waliwo omuntu wano yali yeetaaga nnyo obuyambi.
It will be hard to back away from that now.	Kijja kuba kizibu okudda emabega okuva ku ekyo kati.
I go to my room.	Ngenda mu kisenge kyange.
It was the right answer for everyone.	Kyali kya kuddamu kituufu eri buli muntu.
He was beautiful.	Yali mulungi.
I am a lucky person.	Ndi muntu wa mukisa.
He knew that all too well.	Ekyo yali akimanyi bulungi nnyo.
Who was he.	Ani gwe yali.
You don’t know.	Tomanyi.
I’m pretty good at trouble.	Nze ndi mulungi nnyo mu buzibu.
But this is good for me.	Naye kino kirungi gyendi.
It was a great time for both of us.	Kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo gye tuli ffembi.
How have you been.	Obadde otya.
That’s when he came to me.	Wano we yajja gyendi.
He has no idea what it is.	Talina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki.
Everyone knows someone who knows someone.	Buli muntu amanyi omuntu amanyi omuntu.
It’s the job.	Gwe mulimu.
He was something, really good.	Yali kintu, mulungi ddala.
The plan certainly worked.	Mazima ddala enteekateeka eyo yakola.
But you can’t have everything.	Naye tosobola kuba na buli kimu.
Not always a good reason.	Si bulijjo nsonga nnungi.
It had to be you.	Kyalina okuba ggwe.
You are beautiful.	Oli mulungi.
I didn’t know it.	Nze nali simanyi.
I don’t want to do that too much.	Ekyo saagala kukikola nnyo.
He just hoped she was okay.	Yali asuubira kyokka nti yali bulungi.
In that case.	Mu mbeera eyo.
I have no idea about that at all.	Ekyo sirina ndowooza yonna n’akatono.
And there’s no reason you can’t.	Era tewali nsonga lwaki tosobola.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
You do the same thing.	Naawe okola ekintu kye kimu.
I feel better though.	Mpulira bulungi wadde.
This was an important thing.	Kino kyali kintu kikulu.
He worked hard.	Yakola nnyo.
We are here in the moment.	Tuli wano mu kiseera kino.
Or, something like that.	Oba, ekintu nga ekyo.
I’m sorry, but that’s obvious.	Nsonyiwa naye ekyo kya lwatu.
He shouldn’t be here.	Tasaanidde kubeera wano.
Not me, he wanted to say, not me.	Si nze, yali ayagala okugamba nti, si nze.
I can’t eat much right now.	Sisobola kulya nnyo mu kiseera kino.
And he has a reason.	Era alina ensonga.
I’m going to say this again.	Kino ngenda kuddamu okwogera.
He wasn’t thinking clearly.	Yali talowooza bulungi.
To get to the bottom.	Okutuuka wansi.
It could be this week.	Kiyinza okuba wiiki eno.
And he didn’t want to know, either.	Era yali tayagala kumanya, era.
I’m home now.	Nze ndi waka kati.
Talking behind my back.	Okwogera emabega wange.
Even now he almost looks good.	Ne kati kumpi alabika bulungi.
They are there.	Bali eyo.
It’s not real.	Si ya ddala.
Someone was already gone.	Omuntu yali yagenda dda.
We have to win to move forward.	Tulina okuwangula okugenda mu maaso.
He'll be back next week.	Agenda kudda wiiki ejja.
My friend said she wanted to go at that time.	Mukwano gwange yagamba nti ayagala kugenda mu kiseera ekyo.
This is probably a good thing.	Kino osanga kintu kirungi.
But who knows .	Naye ani amanyi .
Back to me, actually.	Okudda gyendi, mu butuufu.
He didn’t even know himself.	Yali tamanyi na ye kennyini.
It was his way.	Yali ngeri ye.
Maybe he's just going to do it.	Mpozzi agenda kukola kyokka.
It’s almost too easy.	Kumpi kyangu nnyo.
He is a real lover.	Ye muganzi ddala.
I didn’t want any help.	Nnali saagala buyambi bwonna.
That’s good for us.	Ekyo kirungi gye tuli.
I love my house.	Njagala nnyo ennyumba yange.
It was a force.	Yali maanyi.
Anyone can do that.	Ekyo omuntu yenna asobola okukikola.
He didn't know what he was thinking.	Yali tamanyi kye yali alowooza.
He had it with my dad .	Yalina ne taata wange .
It was a little more complicated than that.	Kyali kizibu katono okusinga ekyo.
He is stronger than we are right now.	Alina amaanyi okusinga ffe mu kiseera kino.
It was very easy to do.	Kyali kyangu nnyo okukola.
This way you know yourself.	Mu ngeri eno omanyi ggwe kennyini.
But it’s not the same thing.	Naye si kintu kye kimu.
He had plenty of time.	Yalina obudde bungi.
Still, however, no one was speaking.	Kyokka n’okutuusa kati tewali yali ayogera.
Himself.	Ye kennyini.
But this was also powerful.	Naye kino era kyali kya maanyi.
He was well aware of this.	Kino yali akimanyi bulungi.
He is very strong.	Ali wa maanyi nnyo.
Maybe that was a good thing, though.	Kyokka, mpozzi ekyo kyali kirungi.
That’s good for us.	Ekyo kirungi gye tuli.
You’ve been doing so much.	Obadde okola bingi nnyo.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I needed to read.	Nnali nneetaaga okusoma.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
That would be me.	Ekyo kyandibadde nze.
But he had his reasons.	Naye yalina ensonga ze.
However, it doesn’t seem to be.	Kyokka, kirabika si bwe kiri.
That's his whole thing.	Ekyo kye kintu kye kyonna.
We have no idea what to do.	Tetulina kirowoozo kyonna ku kya kukola.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
Apparently we all have the same problem.	Kirabika ffenna tulina ekizibu kye kimu.
Apparently this is it.	Kirabika kino kye kiri.
It was	Yali .
I think that’s true.	Ndowooza ekyo kituufu.
No, he isn’t.	Nedda, si bw’atyo.
He would have been very happy.	Yandibadde musanyufu nnyo.
I think you already know that.	Ndowooza ekyo okimanyi dda.
I think he's probably very happy.	Ndowooza osanga musanyufu nnyo.
In fact, they already are.	Mu butuufu, bwe bali dda.
Not nearly enough to answer.	Si kumpi nnyo na kuddamu.
This will not work.	Kino tekijja kukola.
The hour is near.	Essaawa eri kumpi.
It can be difficult.	Kiyinza okuba nga kizibu.
I had no time to say anything.	Nnali sirina budde bwa kwogera kintu kyonna.
No strength, he thought.	Tewali maanyi, bwe yalowooza.
It’s hard to achieve something like that.	Kizibu okutuuka ku kintu ng’ekyo.
I want it here right now.	Njagala wano mu kiseera kino.
He is at home.	Ali waka.
Just this thing.	Ekintu kino kyokka.
But I’m the only one.	Naye nze nzekka.
I like to think.	Njagala nnyo okulowooza.
It’s pretty good.	Kirungi bulungi.
He was doing well.	Yali akola bulungi.
Right now, I’m not too happy.	Mu kiseera kino, si musanyufu nnyo.
He still couldn’t believe it.	Yali n’okutuusa kati yali tasobola kukkiriza.
I can speak clearly.	Nsobola okwogera obulungi.
And in the meantime.	Era mu kiseera kino.
That’s right, you can’t.	Kituufu, tosobola.
You don’t have to know.	Tolina kumanya.
He could have lived here.	Yali asobola okubeera wano.
Good thing he knows that much already.	Kirungi nti amanyi nnyo ekyo dda.
But we are not the car.	Naye si ffe mmotoka.
I am not sure how to do this.	Sikakasa ngeri ya kukola kino.
He was anything but.	Yali kintu kyonna naye.
To make this point.	Okukola ensonga eno.
He is at work.	Ali ku mulimu.
Really, pretty intense.	Ddala, bulungi nnyo nga ya maanyi.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
Same with you, of course.	Kye kimu naawe, ddala.
Not always, probably.	Si bulijjo, oboolyawo.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
He was almost behind her.	Yali kumpi emabega we.
That’s true, obviously.	Ekyo kituufu, kya lwatu.
But it’s not true.	Naye si kituufu.
Buying is safe.	Okugula tewali bulabe.
I have to deal with everything.	Nnina okukola ku buli kimu.
It was beautiful.	Yali nnungi.
He doesn't like he's doing it.	Tayagala nnyo ali kukikola.
I was always terrified.	Bulijjo nnali ntya nnyo.
Maybe that’s what he was thinking.	Mpozzi ekyo kye yali alowooza.
Maybe he was planning to.	Mpozzi yali ateekateeka okukikola.
He made a point.	Yakola ensonga.
He didn't know how to deal with this.	Kino yali tamanyi ngeri ya kukola ku nsonga eno.
We were at home.	Twali waka.
I thought he would.	Nnalowooza nti ajja kukikola.
And we have so many.	Era tulina bingi nnyo.
I think it would be nice.	Ndowooza kyandibadde kirungi.
That’s not who we are.	Ekyo si kye tuli.
It is much easier than that.	Kyangu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
But not everyone will.	Naye si buli muntu nti ajja kukikola.
Not a good plan.	Si nteekateeka nnungi.
You’re not alone.	Si ggwe wekka.
But he knew that was not the case.	Naye yali akimanyi nti ekyo si bwe kyali.
Everyone thought so, except me.	Buli omu yalowooza bw’atyo, okuggyako nze.
And mostly, no.	Era okusinga, nedda.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
If it were true.	Singa kyali kituufu.
Something about that mattered.	Ekintu ku ekyo kyali kikulu.
One will be fine.	Omu ajja kuba bulungi.
I’m not sure that.	Sikakasa nti.
And it was a sin.	Era kyali kibi.
But it wasn’t, not really.	Naye si bwe kyali, si ddala.
You are so good to me.	Oli mulungi nnyo gyendi.
But you have to win.	Naye olina okuwangula.
And he will be very strong.	Era ajja kuba wa maanyi nnyo.
I can be anyone.	Nsobola okuba omuntu yenna.
Each is dangerous in their own way.	Buli omu wa bulabe mu ngeri ye.
Not where it matters.	Si we kikulu.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
We will be him.	Tujja kuba ye.
He knows where.	Amanyi wa.
He probably knew everything.	Oboolyawo yali amanyi buli kimu.
I can certainly see this perspective on this.	Mazima ddala nsobola okulaba endowooza eno ku nsonga eno.
This is not an opinion.	Eno si ndowooza.
He wasn’t the man he was.	Si ye musajja gwe yali.
Maybe that's just me.	Mpozzi oyo nze nzekka.
It was just the right thing to do.	Kyali kintu kituufu kyokka okukola.
I’m going to do this.	Kino ngenda kukikola.
This is my point today.	Eno y’ensonga yange leero.
Maybe it was like that.	Mpozzi nga bwe kyali.
I don’t think .	Sirowooza nti .
He thinks that’s really bad for you.	Alowooza nti ekyo ddala kibi gy’oli.
Talking about the same thing.	Okwogera ku kintu kye kimu.
I have a brother.	Nnina muganda wange.
Just something in the sky.	Ekintu kyokka mu bbanga.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
That was low, really low.	Ekyo kyali wansi, ddala wansi.
I will stay in my room.	Nja kusigala mu kisenge kyange.
I can’t do that at all.	Ekyo siyinza n’akatono.
I go to them a lot.	Ngenda gye bali nnyo.
Together, we really can achieve more.	Nga tuli wamu, ddala tusobola okutuuka ku bingi.
You, you’re so young.	Ggwe, oli muto nnyo.
I know you are one.	Nkimanyi nti ggwe oli omu.
All at the same time.	Byonna mu kiseera kye kimu.
He looked happy.	Yali alabika nga musanyufu.
Something's not right, not right at all.	Ekintu si kituufu, si kituufu n'akatono.
I really don’t care and I don’t want to know.	Mu butuufu sifaayo era saagala kumanya.
It is still early here.	Wano bukyali bukyali.
Now obviously .	Kati kya lwatu nti .
Perhaps they are.	Oboolyawo bwe bali.
I can’t stay here longer than a little while.	Siyinza kusigala wano okusinga akaseera katono.
She looks good for a while but not for long.	Alabika bulungi okumala akaseera naye nga si lwa bbanga ddene.
And that’s pretty cool.	Era ekyo kirungi nnyo.
He is very sick.	Mulwadde nnyo.
However, one can go further.	Kyokka, omuntu asobola okugenda mu maaso.
You want yourself.	Oyagala wekka.
Not at all, of course.	Si bwe kiri n’akatono, ddala.
Having a boyfriend.	Okubeera ne muganzi.
This is actually not hard to do.	Kino mu butuufu si kizibu kukola.
It was the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu.
They are both very well.	Bombi bali bulungi nnyo.
It’s what’s going on.	Kye kigenda mu maaso.
He does very well though.	Akola bulungi nnyo wadde.
Now it’s not there.	Kati si awo.
I am, but not mine.	Nze, naye si wange.
However, he knows it.	Kyokka, akimanyi.
Although, he would rather not.	Wadde, yandibadde asinga obutakola.
He was going to be a father.	Yali agenda kubeera taata.
I’m not a guy who likes to go fast.	Siri ggaayi ayagala nnyo okugenda amangu.
Though not for everyone.	Wadde nga si kya buli muntu.
But it was, at the time.	Naye bwe kyali, mu kiseera ekyo.
That’s not a bad idea.	Ekyo si kirowoozo kibi.
There is no organization more important than home.	Tewali kibiina kikulu okusinga awaka.
He talks about it but there is no plan.	Ayogera ku nsonga eno naye nga tewali nteekateeka.
That was more true now than it was then.	Ekyo kyali kituufu nnyo kati okusinga bwe kyali mu kiseera ekyo.
And he didn’t want to.	Era yali tayagala.
No, please don't.	Nedda, nsaba nedda.
What he said exactly.	Kye yayogera ddala.
He tried everything.	Yagezaako buli kimu.
Very happy, of course.	Musanyufu nnyo, ddala.
I wanted to go home.	Nnali njagala kudda waka.
Do you want to?.	Oyagala?.
He had no reason to do so.	Yali talina nsonga lwaki yali akola ekyo.
It’s my organization.	Kye kibiina kyange.
I thought of my own thought.	Nalowooza ku ndowooza yange kennyini gye nnali ndowooza.
He needed dinner.	Yali yeetaaga ekyeggulo.
He won’t be with you.	Tajja kuba naawe.
She will have to go with him, like it or not.	Ajja kuba alina okugenda naye, ayagala oba nedda.
That’s easy to say, but hard to do.	Ekyo kyangu okwogera, naye kizibu okukola.
No.	Nedda.
I'm not entirely sure it's important for everything.	Sikakasa ddala nti kikulu ku buli kimu.
He would have liked to call.	Yandibadde ayagala okukuba essimu.
I wanted to be good.	Nnali njagala kubeera mulungi.
And this is something.	Era kino kintu.
I think he probably did.	Ndowooza osanga yakikola.
In this case, we can help.	Mu mbeera eno, tusobola okuyamba.
I really don’t know what to do.	Mu butuufu simanyi kya kukola.
He does it a lot.	Akikola nnyo.
The guy can.	Ggaayi asobola.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
Talking to him.	Okwogera naye.
Too early to go home.	Nga bukyali nnyo okudda eka.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Tewali kibi kyonna.
I do know one thing.	Nze mmanyi ekintu kimu.
All he knew.	Byonna bye yali amanyi.
His picture appears below.	Ekifaananyi kye kirabika wansi.
It’s not a woman’s job.	Si mulimu gwa mukyala.
And very, very dangerous.	Era nga kya bulabe nnyo nnyo.
I thought quickly.	Nalowooza mangu.
This is why they are in school.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki bali mu ssomero.
He had no appetite.	Yali talina njagala ya kulya.
It may be.	Kiyinza okuba nga...
I have nothing .	Nze sirina kintu kyonna .
You can’t stay.	Tosobola kusigala.
There was no way he could be alone.	Tewali ngeri gye yali asobola kubeera yekka.
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
And he’s going to know.	Era agenda kumanya.
He didn’t want to be here.	Yali tayagala kubeera wano.
Who is the teacher.	Nga ye musomesa.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
I had no answer for this.	Kino nnali sirina kya kuddamu.
Everything will work fine.	Buli kimu kijja kukola bulungi.
He shouldn’t have anyone but me.	Talina kuba na muntu yenna okuggyako nze.
On his position.	Ku kifo kye.
At the same time we.	Mu kiseera kye kimu ffe.
We certainly should.	Mazima ddala tusaanidde.
In my room.	Mu kisenge kyange.
It goes as follows.	Kigenda nga bwe kiri wansi.
He obviously wanted one.	Kya lwatu yali ayagala emu.
The way you are.	Engeri gy’oli.
You do the exact same thing.	Ggwe okola ekintu kye kimu ddala.
But what was it.	Naye kiki kye kyali.
Really good at almost anything.	Ddala mulungi kumpi mu kintu kyonna.
There is something in there for everyone.	Waliwo ekintu mu eyo eri buli muntu.
It was time to speak up.	Kyali kiseera okwogera.
That would be very difficult.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
I love how it looks.	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kirabika.
It is very, very dangerous.	Kya bulabe nnyo nnyo.
What is that	Ekyo kye ki .
The food was actually pretty good.	Emmere mu butuufu yali nnungi nnyo.
He made a picture.	Yakola ekifaananyi.
I just like to do my thing.	Njagala nnyo okukola ekintu kyange kyokka.
You’re just going to talk.	Ogenda kwogera kyokka.
There is nothing here.	Tewali kintu kyonna kiri wano.
But that’s not .	Naye ekyo si .
Not there, anyway.	Si awo, mu ngeri yonna.
I’m not really a talkative person.	Mu butuufu siri muntu ayogera.
He was a very nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo.
And this looks really good.	Era kino kirabika bulungi ddala.
It was a penny.	Yali ssente ya ssente.
You have to go immediately.	Olina okugenda amangu ddala.
He shouldn’t have done this.	Kino yali tasaanidde kukikola.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
And as such, too.	Era nga bwe kiri, era.
No energy at all.	Tewali maanyi n’akatono.
It seems like everything is there.	Kirabika buli kimu kiri awo.
No, that would be too easy.	Nedda, ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
I can do anything without any excuses.	Nsobola okukola ekintu kyonna nga sirina nsonga yonna.
I don’t think I can say in advance.	Ndowooza sisobola kwogera nga bukyali.
We’re almost home.	Tuli kumpi okutuuka awaka.
This was low-key.	Kino kyali kya wansi.
That’s really the point here for me.	Eyo ddala y’ensonga wano gyendi.
But it’s not the kind I know.	Naye si kya ngeri gye mmanyi.
They were very strong.	Baali ba maanyi nnyo.
Now he had it.	Kati yalina.
But this was definitely a very difficult time for me.	Naye kino mazima ddala kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo gyendi.
And you know, it wasn’t even that .	Era omanyi, si kyali wadde ekyo .
However, there is no problem.	Kyokka, tewali buzibu.
It is dangerous and evil.	Kya bulabe era kibi.
He was my guy.	Yali ggaayi wange.
She always looked great.	Bulijjo yalabika bulungi nnyo.
I guess that’s a thing.	Ntebereza nti ekyo kintu.
You are a good man.	Oli musajja mulungi.
It was probably pretty cool.	Oboolyawo kyali kirungi nnyo.
But he did nothing.	Naye tewali kye yakola.
Everyone had to go.	Buli omu yalina okugenda.
He probably should have known better.	Oboolyawo yandibadde asinga okumanya.
Or he thought he did.	Oba yalowooza nti yakikola.
He wasn’t young.	Yali si muto.
But obviously he did.	Naye kya lwatu nti yakikola.
This will no longer work.	Kino tekijja kuddamu kukola.
But you are not.	Naye ggwe si bwe kiri.
He was a wonderful child.	Yali mwana mulungi nnyo.
I want to be there.	Njagala kubeerawo.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
Now he and I are alone.	Kati nze naye ffekka.
I know it will happen.	Nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
That’s dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe.
I know how unhappy he was with you.	Nkimanyi engeri gye yali si musanyufu naawe.
It’s not anyone’s business.	Si nsonga ya muntu yenna.
I am very close to doing it.	Nze kumpi nnyo okukikola.
But he was afraid to do it.	Naye yali atya okukikola.
He didn’t have to do it.	Yali talina kukikola.
And that’s not true.	Era ekyo si kituufu.
That in many ways was the case.	Ekyo mu ngeri nnyingi bwe kyali.
He speaks down.	Ayogera wansi.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nnali simanyi kye kyali.
However, it was difficult to do so.	Kyokka kyali kizibu okukikola.
The thing is the thing.	Ekintu kye kintu.
Everyone has an opinion on this one.	Buli omu alina endowooza ku eno.
I need to get out of this town.	Nze nneetaaga okuva mu kibuga kino.
He had a reason for being there.	Yalina ensonga lwaki yali awo.
I was thinking only of myself.	Nali ndowooza ku nze nzekka.
He has been working all morning.	Enkya yonna abadde akola.
And you know, it probably was.	Era omanyi, osanga bwe kyali.
We really have no choice.	Mazima ddala tetulina kya kukola.
But always friendly.	Naye nga wa mukwano bulijjo.
Only one actually.	Omu yekka mu butuufu.
You will certainly do it.	Mazima ddala ojja kukikola.
I think we will win.	Ndowooza tujja kuwangula.
He knew it though.	Yali akimanyi wadde.
However, he should not have done so.	Kyokka, yali tasaanidde kukikola.
Whoever lives.	Oyo yenna abeera.
You can’t do that.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola.
He will have to go.	Ajja kuba alina okugenda.
I had no idea what this could be.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kino kye kiyinza okuba.
I am in all the time .	Nze ndi mu buli kiseera .
I hope he is not at work tonight.	Nsuubira nti ekiro kino tali ku mulimu.
Not really, no.	Si ddala, nedda.
It can happen to anyone, even someone like me.	Kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna, wadde omuntu yenna nga nze.
And that's what that is.	Era ekyo kye ekyo.
Not to them.	Si gye bali.
It was the truth, and it was easy to say.	Yali mazima, era nga kyangu okwogera.
We’re fine there.	Tuli bulungi eyo.
But maybe that’s not a problem.	Naye mpozzi ekyo si kizibu.
Although it was true.	Wadde nga kyali kituufu.
He wasn’t sick.	Yali si mulwadde.
He is better than that.	Ye asinga ekyo.
I know it really well.	Nkimanyi bulungi ddala.
Nothing he did seemed right.	Tewali kye yakola kyali kirabika nga kituufu.
He started to back away.	Yatandika okudda emabega.
Winning is really, really hard.	Okuwangula ddala, ddala kizibu.
And it was very, very difficult.	Era kyali kizibu nnyo nnyo.
Not much of a chance there.	Si bingi ku mukisa eyo.
That was a terrible thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi nnyo.
But he was very young.	Naye nga muto nnyo.
However, this is not always the case.	Kyokka kino si bwe kiri bulijjo.
I don’t really like that myself.	Nze kennyini ekyo sikyagala nnyo.
Really or not really.	Ddala oba si ddala.
He was very friendly and down to earth.	Yali wa mukwano nnyo era nga wa wansi.
This morning.	Enkya ya leero.
Not a real person.	Si muntu ddala.
This is perhaps as true today as it was then.	Kino oboolyawo kituufu leero nga bwe kyali mu kiseera ekyo.
He wasn’t even in the car yet.	Yali tannaba na mu mmotoka.
Not that he didn’t want to do it.	Si nti yali tayagala kukikola.
And that was the whole thing.	Era ekyo kye kyali ekintu kyonna.
But nothing can wait until tomorrow.	Naye tewali kiyinza kulinda okutuusa enkya.
And that’s the issue here.	Era eyo y’ensonga wano.
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
But in theory, one could do what one wanted.	Naye mu ndowooza, omuntu yali asobola okukola ky’ayagala.
I guess we'll have to wait until tomorrow.	Ntebereza tujja kulinda okutuusa enkya.
Not that he needed to.	Si nti yali yeetaaga okukikola.
Everyone can eat this.	Buli muntu asobola okulya kino.
But maybe now, you know, you should go.	Naye mpozzi kati, omanyi, wandibadde ogenda.
No one had, as far as he knew.	Tewali yali alina, okutuuka we yali amanyi.
Anyone but him.	Omuntu yenna okuggyako ye.
He felt down.	Yawulira wansi.
He works alone.	Akola yekka.
This is where we need to be.	Wano we twetaaga okubeera.
But he is also not very sick.	Naye era si mulwadde nnyo.
I'm going to move on.	Nze ngenda mu maaso.
That is the real father.	Oyo ye taata ddala.
It is terrible in many ways.	Kibi nnyo mu ngeri nnyingi.
We basically have everything we need.	Okusinga tulina buli kye twetaaga.
Something he knew all night.	Ekintu kye yali amanyi ekiro kyonna.
He didn’t want to be there.	Yali tayagala kubeerawo.
No one is really happy.	Tewali muntu yenna musanyufu ddala.
Had everything we needed.	Yalina buli kye twali twetaaga.
Both were.	Bombi baali...
You can do anything.	Osobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nkola.
When he might have done so safely.	Bwe yali ayinza okuba nga yakikola nga talina bulabe.
But we were friends.	Naye twali ba mukwano.
That's the problem with him.	Ekyo kye kizibu ky'ali.
The best will win.	Asinga ajja kuwangula.
That's why he knew he could do this.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki yali akimanyi nti kino asobola okukikola.
I’m good that way.	Nze ndi mulungi mu ngeri eyo.
I didn’t know what to say or do.	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera oba kya kukola.
He could hardly speak.	Yali tasobola bulungi kwogera.
Perhaps he had.	Oboolyawo yalina.
I didn’t know what to expect.	Nnali simanyi kye nsuubira.
He thought he had to be.	Yalowooza nti yalina okuba bw’atyo.
It won’t be a problem.	Tekijja kuba kizibu.
It’s not as bad as that.	Si kibi nga ekyo.
He was still there.	Yali akyali awo.
This was a blessing.	Kino kyali kya mukisa.
You will win.	Ggwe ojja kuwangula.
This is not helpful.	Kino si kya buyambi.
I will find somewhere to live.	Nja kufuna we nnyinza okubeera.
And he is sick.	Era mulwadde.
Then he is alone.	Awo ye yekka.
I wanted to be with him.	Nnali njagala kubeera naye.
I don’t think it would be very good.	Sirowooza nti kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
Take a picture every morning.	Kuba ekifaananyi buli ku makya.
It probably doesn’t matter.	Oboolyawo si kikulu.
He’s not just a man.	Si musajja yekka.
You don’t even have to be here.	Tolina wadde okubeera wano.
I hope there are no problems.	Nsuubira nti tewali buzibu bwonna.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
But he is not alone.	Naye si ye yekka.
That will happen tomorrow.	Ekyo kijja kubaawo enkya.
He should have gone a long time ago.	Yandibadde agenda dda nnyo.
But maybe that’s a good thing.	Naye mpozzi ekyo kintu kirungi.
I was sure of that.	Ekyo nnali nkakasa.
And that’s really important.	Era ekyo kikulu nnyo ddala.
In many ways this is a good thing.	Mu ngeri nnyingi kino kintu kirungi.
I think it’s beautiful.	Ndowooza nti nnungi.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
It probably won’t happen.	Oboolyawo tekijja kubaawo.
You’re always there.	Bulijjo oli awo.
I’m going to make this movie.	Nze ngenda kukola firimu eno.
There is nothing to gain.	Tewali kya kufuna.
Forward, backward.	Mu maaso, emabega.
Which way do you want to go.	Oyagala kugenda mu ngeri eyo ki.
He looked very happy.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
He did very well.	Yakola bulungi nnyo.
He knows not to act too soon.	Amanyi obutakola mangu nnyo.
He wanted to	Yali ayagala .
He is sick.	Ali mulwadde.
That will all be for now.	Ekyo kyonna kijja kuba kya kiseera kino.
I think we can think a lot like here, too.	Ndowooza tusobola okulowooza bingi nga wano, naffe.
I’m doing fine.	Nze nkola bulungi.
He is a teacher and a musician.	Ye musomesa era muyimbi.
To address this issue.	Okukola ku nsonga eno.
He came right away.	Yajja mangu ddala.
I still can’t tell.	Nze n’okutuusa kati sisobola kumanya.
That won’t happen.	Ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
He had no plans.	Yali talina nteekateeka yonna.
I love this office and feel very comfortable there.	Njagala nnyo ofiisi eno era mpulira bulungi nnyo eyo.
I’d like to think that’s true.	Njagala okulowooza nti ekyo kituufu.
I’m a man of opinion.	Nze ndi musajja wa ndowooza.
He talks himself into trouble.	Ayogera ye kennyini mu buzibu.
But that wasn’t the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kyali.
Coming home early.	Okudda awaka nga bukyali.
Even as a child.	Ne bwe yali akyali mwana muto.
It was very important to me.	Kyali kikulu nnyo gyendi.
Perhaps it was the case here.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali wano.
There is a friend of his.	Waliwo mukwano gwe.
He actually said so .	Mu butuufu yagamba bw'atyo .
He didn’t have to do it.	Yali talina kukikola.
I had no idea it would be you.	Nali sirina kirowoozo nti yandibadde ggwe.
But for us it was really bad.	Naye gye tuli kyali kibi nnyo ddala.
That one didn’t want to.	Oyo yali tayagala.
I’m very happy here.	Nze wano ndi musanyufu nnyo.
It's not you.	Si ggwe.
Indeed, soon someone did.	Mazima ddala, mu bbanga ttono omuntu yakikola.
I think that’s a good thing.	Ndowooza ekyo kirungi.
But that doesn’t matter right now.	Naye ekyo si kikulu mu kiseera kino.
. . . .	.
That’s all that matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu kyokka.
I thought it was great.	Nalowooza nti kyali kirungi nnyo.
And my father.	Ne taata wange.
Love the baby so much.	Kwagala nnyo mwana.
My boyfriend and I were alone.	Nze ne muganzi wange twali nzekka.
This is all we have.	Kino kyokka kye tulina.
I need help with something.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi ku kintu.
You knew that.	Ekyo wali okimanyi.
It was very easy for me.	Kyali kyangu nnyo gyendi.
He had no reason to do so.	Yali talina nsonga lwaki yali akola bw’atyo.
There's a bottom.	Eyo wansi.
I hear you are beautiful.	Mpulira oli mulungi.
I think it’s a good thing.	Ndowooza nti kintu kirungi.
He couldn’t see anyone.	Yali tasobola kulaba muntu yenna.
We were the same.	Ffe twali kye kimu.
See .	Okulaba .
I feel it’s a great place.	Mpulira nti kifo kirungi nnyo.
And that was pretty cool.	Era ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
Something is something is something.	Ekintu kye kintu kye kintu.
There is hope for me.	Waliwo essuubi gyendi.
It’s in you.	Kiri mu ggwe.
It was a little early.	Yali nga bukyali katono.
And he probably has.	Era oboolyawo alina.
I can live here, buy my food here.	Nsobola okubeera wano, okugula emmere yange wano.
That’s his room.	Ekyo kye kisenge kye.
I'm going to.	Nze ngenda ku...
I was sick.	Nnali mulwadde.
And this is why.	Era eno y’ensonga lwaki...
No one wanted to know anything.	Tewali yali ayagala kumanya kintu kyonna.
For me.	Ku nze.
However, it was good.	Kyokka, kyali kirungi.
Happy day!.	Olunaku lwa mukisa!.
I loved everyone.	Buli muntu nnali njagala nnyo.
Or no one at all.	Oba tewali muntu yenna n’akatono.
. . . .	.
It’s not a thing.	Si kintu.
I wanted to be alone.	Nnali njagala kubeera nzekka.
He must be like.	Alina okuba nga.
I knew this all too well.	Kino nnali nkimanyi bulungi nnyo.
Or something was.	Oba ekintu kyali.
Anyone could have done it.	Omuntu yenna yandiba nga yakikola.
It’s not what you thought.	Si kye wali olowooza.
And it’s so beautiful.	Era nga kirungi nnyo.
You don’t have to do that.	Ekyo tolina kukikola.
Whatever you want.	Kyonna ky’oyagala.
Good person, how about that.	Omuntu omulungi, ekyo otya.
They are not dangerous.	Si ba bulabe.
No one spoke much.	Tewali yayogera nnyo.
He thought he was doing the right thing.	Yalowooza nti yali akola kituufu.
It’s a blessing more than anything.	Gwe mukisa okusinga ekintu kyonna.
Reading as revision.	Okusoma nga okuddamu okusoma.
And now he could clearly see why.	Era kati yali asobola bulungi okulaba ensonga lwaki.
We are probably all very close to him.	Oboolyawo ffenna tuli kumpi nnyo naye.
And that’s pretty much what it is.	Era ekyo kirungi nnyo kye kiri.
I hope it will happen.	Nsuubira nti kijja kubaawo.
She had to talk to him.	Yalina okwogera naye.
This is a fact.	Kino kya mazima.
I said no, I didn't.	Nagamba nti nedda.
He was so much fun to talk to.	Yali musanyufu nnyo okwogera naye.
But he was not a loner.	Naye yali si muntu abeera yekka.
But that’s unusual for me.	Naye ekyo si kya bulijjo gyendi.
And everyone knows it.	Era buli omu akimanyi.
We can’t do this.	Kino tetusobola kukikola.
It’s definitely a good thing.	Mazima ddala kintu kirungi.
He got a lot done.	Yafuna bingi bye yakola.
You can say anything.	Oyinza okwogera ekintu kyonna.
It may not have been.	Kiyinza okuba nga si bwe kyali.
Or, actually, he got.	Oba, mu butuufu, yafuna.
I don’t have an answer for that.	Ekyo sirina kya kuddamu.
I’ve always wanted to.	Bulijjo mbadde njagala.
Which .	Nga .
And that’s absolutely fine.	Era ekyo kirungi ddala.
As it should be.	Nga bwe kyandibadde.
I have no answer.	Sirina kya kuddamu.
They are in love.	Bali mu mukwano.
In fact, time is his friend.	Mu butuufu obudde gwe mukwano gwe.
He is a car man.	Ye musajja wa mmotoka.
You have to know.	Olina okumanya.
It’s happening everywhere.	Kigenda mu maaso buli wamu.
From me.	Okuva ku nze.
Obviously not here.	Kya lwatu nti wano si bwe kiri.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
Don’t go to the party.	Togenda ku mbaga.
This is very low.	Kino kiri wansi nnyo.
We can talk about anything you want.	Tusobola okwogera ku kintu kyonna ky’oyagala.
I'll stay with you for a while.	Nja kusigala naawe okumala akaseera.
He doesn’t seem to want to talk at all.	Alabika tayagala kwogera n’akatono.
The average person does.	Omuntu wa bulijjo akola.
This will not be a problem.	Kino tekijja kuba kizibu.
I didn’t know anyone in town.	Mu kibuga nnali simanyi muntu yenna.
But he has to think actively.	Naye alina okulowooza okukola.
It’s just a moment.	Akaseera katono ddala.
He can get almost anything.	Kumpi asobola okufuna ekintu kyonna.
I thought you might be sick.	Nalowooza nti oyinza okuba nga oli mulwadde.
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
I knew, and could see nothing wrong.	Nali mmanyi, era nga sisobola kulaba kibi kyonna.
And yes, they are here.	Era ye, bali wano.
Another, another, another.	Omulala, omulala, omulala.
He really wanted this.	Kino yali ayagala nnyo.
In fact, it’s much more complicated than that.	Mu butuufu, kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I have been thinking about this a lot.	Kino mbadde ndowooza nnyo.
But nothing serious.	Naye tewali kintu kya maanyi.
And it is very powerful.	Era kya maanyi nnyo.
We’ll ride with you.	Tujja kuvuga naawe.
I don’t want to talk about anything like that.	Saagala kwogera ku kintu kyonna nga ekyo.
They are in and they are ahead.	Bali mu era bali mu maaso.
He was a really nice guy.	Yali ggaayi mulungi ddala.
I need to know why you are here.	Nnina okumanya lwaki oli wano.
I’m not very happy.	Nze si musanyufu nnyo.
And he couldn’t either.	Era naye yali tasobola.
Then he thought for a moment.	Awo n’alowooza akaseera katono.
And he knew it was true.	Era yali akimanyi nti kituufu.
His best friend.	Mukwano gwe asinga.
Someone will be there.	Omuntu ajja kubeerawo.
I am ready to move on.	Ndi mwetegefu okugenda mu maaso.
Another has to read.	Omulala alina okusoma.
You can know, without knowing at all.	Osobola okumanya, nga tomanyi n’akatono.
You would be mine.	Ggwe wandibadde wange.
The picture was real.	Ekifaananyi kyali kya ddala.
My friend was with me.	Mukwano gwange yali nange.
I don’t think you will.	Sirowooza nti ojja kukikola.
No one seems to know why.	Alabika tewali amanyi lwaki.
Or he tried, anyway.	Oba yagezaako, mu ngeri yonna.
We don’t have a bus here.	Wano tetulina bbaasi.
Maybe he doesn’t have one.	Mpozzi nga talina.
But he will come back to me.	Naye ajja kudda gyendi.
I knew nothing about it.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
And we are friends.	Era tuli ba mukwano.
But that’s where we are.	Naye awo we tuli.
It’s not just me.	Si nze kyokka.
His wife was sick.	Mukyala we yali mulwadde.
I should have considered his opinion.	Nnali nsaanidde okulowooza ku ndowooza ye.
It would be interesting to see what he would do.	Kyandibadde kirungi okulaba kye yandikoze.
His brother is a musician.	Muganda we muyimbi.
It’s good for me.	Kirungi gyendi.
It was my turn now.	Yali kiseera kyange kati.
You will do it too.	Naawe ojja kukikola.
He was a sidekick.	Yali muntu wa ludda.
You can’t live there now.	Tosobola kubeera eyo kati.
That seems to be true.	Ekyo kirabika nga kituufu.
He was very low.	Yali wansi nnyo.
He needed to know.	Yali yeetaaga okumanya.
He was living young.	Yali abeera muto.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
However, I am very happy.	Kyokka, ndi musanyufu nnyo.
I didn’t know what to do here.	Wano nnali simanyi kya kukola.
That could be you.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ggwe.
Everyone loves it.	Buli muntu ayagala nnyo.
I could hardly believe it.	Nnali sisobola n’akatono kukkiriza.
This does not seem to be the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
I love my son.	Njagala mwana wange.
I have to go.	Nnina okugenda.
But it is not the truth.	Naye si kye kituufu.
He knew she looked good.	Yali akimanyi nti alabika bulungi.
But he knows it.	Naye akimanyi.
Now he wants to talk.	Kati ayagala kwogera.
Not quite, but close.	Si nnyo, naye kumpi.
And that's what that is.	Era ekyo kye ekyo.
I thought this was a good thing.	Nalowooza nti kino kintu kirungi.
You will come with us.	Ojja kujja naffe.
However, the problem was more complicated.	Kyokka, ekizibu kyali kizibu nnyo.
This is the crux of the whole matter.	Kino kye kikulu mu nsonga yonna.
Indeed, it had.	Mazima ddala, kyalina.
Hitting is not always effective.	Okukuba si bulijjo nti kukola bulungi.
Let me	Ka nze .
I want to be a nice guy.	Njagala kubeera ggaayi omulungi.
He's fine.	Ali bulungi.
I think this was great.	Ndowooza kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
That way we’ll all be together, then.	Mu ngeri eyo ffenna tujja kuba wamu, awo.
Quite possibly his wife.	Oboolyawo nnyo mukyala we.
It’s just that he’s always with you.	Kye kimu nti bulijjo abeera naawe.
He was an ordinary child.	Yali mwana wa bulijjo.
We need more from us.	Twetaaga bingi okuva gye tuli.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eno.
It was what everyone thought.	Kyali ekyo buli omu kye yalowooza.
Everything he said.	Byonna bye yayogera.
This is both true and incorrect.	Kino kituufu era si kituufu.
We’ll both know.	Ffembi tujja kumanya.
He told me so in the car.	Yang’amba bw’atyo mu mmotoka.
Nothing, or no one.	Tewali kintu kyonna, oba tewali muntu yenna.
We don’t have time for that.	Ekyo tetulina budde.
At that time he was not very well.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali talina bulungi nnyo.
Does anyone know if there is a way to do this.	Waliwo amanyi oba waliwo engeri y'okukola kino.
There is so much more.	Waliwo bingi nnyo.
One, and only one.	Omu, era omu yekka.
I really hope you are happy here.	Mazima nsuubira nti wano oli musanyufu.
But you were one of the .	Naye wali omu ku .
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
He is already.	Ye ye dda.
At the office, and there all morning.	Ku ofiisi, era eyo enkya yonna.
You do the same thing.	Naawe okola kye kimu.
Really, really happy.	Ddala, ddala musanyufu.
The police are there.	Poliisi eri awo.
You are in time.	Oli mu budde.
He could do that.	Ekyo yali asobola okukikola.
That is not the truth.	Ekyo si kye kituufu.
He was very happy about that.	Ekyo yali musanyufu nnyo.
. . . .	.
That’s not his point.	Ekyo si nsonga ye.
But right now we don’t have much time.	Naye mu kiseera kino tetulina budde bungi.
It might be going well.	Kiyinza okuba nga kigenda bulungi.
You want to do it.	Oyagala kukikola.
That was a good point.	Eyo yali nsonga nnungi.
There is no reason why.	Tewali nsonga lwaki.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
Maybe there is no answer.	Mpozzi nga tewali kuddamu.
That’s pretty normal.	Ekyo kirungi kya bulijjo.
We all need help.	Ffenna twetaaga obuyambi.
It was happening so fast.	Kyali kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
And, of course, everything is fine.	Era, ddala, buli kimu kiri bulungi.
His dad is very sick, you know.	Taata we mulwadde nnyo, omanyi.
I was there to eat.	Nali awo okulya.
There is nothing to do.	Tewali kya kukola.
And that’s all he thought.	Era ekyo kyokka kye yalowooza.
It’s coming soon.	Kigenda kujja mu bbanga ttono.
He should have, probably.	Yandibadde alina, oboolyawo.
Now he knew better.	Kati yali amanyi bulungi.
I will never buy anything again.	Sijja kuddamu kugula kintu kyonna.
We have three.	Tulina ssatu.
He had to go.	Yalina okugenda.
He has a job.	Alina omulimu.
But, he was fast asleep.	Naye, yali yeebase nnyo.
And yet here he was.	Era naye wano we yali.
I can do that too.	Ekyo nange nsobola okukikola.
It looks terrible.	Kirabika kibi nnyo.
He really tried to help.	Ddala yagezaako okuyamba.
And his friends.	Ne mikwano gye.
I feel good about it.	Mpulira bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
I really don’t want to be alone right now.	Mazima ddala saagala kubeera nzekka mu kiseera kino.
It wasn’t what he expected.	Si kye yali asuubira.
And you’re not alone.	Era si ggwe wekka.
He wasn’t going to win.	Yali tagenda kuwangula.
One point in the matter.	Ensonga emu mu nsonga.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
He was a man of so many issues.	Yali musajja wa nsonga nnyingi nnyo.
No one had to do it.	Tewali muntu yenna yalina kukikola.
It could have been almost anything.	Kyandibadde kumpi ekintu kyonna.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I didn’t want to do anything.	Nnali saagala kukola kintu kyonna.
He would have been here anyway.	Yandibadde wano mu ngeri yonna.
I am so sorry	Nsonyiwa nnyo .
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
Nobody wants to live there.	Tewali ayagala kubeera eyo.
He won't know it's on.	Tajja kumanya nti kiri ku.
I don’t have time.	Sirina budde.
Don’t go too low.	Togenda wansi nnyo.
He wants one.	Ayagala emu.
You don’t matter.	Ggwe tolina kikulu.
Maybe a book.	Mpozzi ekitabo.
And he's there.	Era ali awo.
I wanted to see that dog.	Nnali njagala okulaba embwa eyo.
It was a good thing.	Kyali kirungi.
It’s harder than anything.	Kizibu okusinga ekintu kyonna.
This is a good movie.	Eno firimu nnungi.
Not for his wife.	Si lwa mukyala we.
He got what he wanted.	Yafuna ky’ayagala.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
You will stay here.	Ojja kusigala wano.
This is really something.	Kino ddala kintu.
And you don’t want to know.	Era toyagala kumanya.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira nga ndi mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
I really thought it would work.	Ddala nnalowooza nti kijja kukola.
That was just one city.	Ekyo kyali kibuga kimu kyokka.
I loved everybody.	Nnali njagala nnyo buli muntu.
He was really strong.	Yali wa maanyi ddala.
He had to know better than that.	Yalina okumanya okusinga ekyo.
He thinks you’re beautiful.	Alowooza nti oli mulungi.
We can do that.	Ekyo tusobola okukikola.
We can’t win.	Tetusobola kuwangula.
Not much, but it’s an issue.	Si bingi, naye nsonga.
He felt a little better, but not much.	Yawulira bulungi katono, naye nga si nnyo.
I’m not a singer.	Nze siri muyimbi.
They belonged together, they were completely together.	Baali ba wamu, baali ddala wamu.
No problem with me anyway.	Tewali buzibu nange mu ngeri yonna.
And now everything is happening.	Era kati buli kimu kigenda mu maaso.
I’m sure I’m sorry about that.	Nkakasa nti nsonyiwa ku nsonga eyo.
But in reality, they are not.	Naye mu butuufu, si bwe bali.
That’s the time.	Ekyo kye kiseera.
I really didn’t know what to do with it.	Mazima ddala nnali simanyi kya kukikola.
I work for a long time.	Nkola ebbanga ddene.
Maybe we should.	Mpozzi nga tusaanidde.
Like your point.	Nga ensonga yo.
And in good condition.	Era mu mbeera nnungi.
Indeed, it is excellent.	Mazima ddala, kirungi nnyo.
But that’s fine.	Naye ekyo kiri bulungi.
I’m not sure how young he is.	Sikakasa nti muto atya.
We will have to go to town.	Tujja kuba tulina okugenda mu kibuga.
And it is very important to do so.	Era kikulu nnyo okukikola.
I was a young child.	Nnali mwana muto.
Now, that’s very hard to do alone.	Kati, ekyo kizibu nnyo okukola wekka.
He was dangerous.	Yali wa bulabe.
He couldn’t stay here.	Yali tasobola kusigala wano.
Now he was going.	Kati yali agenda.
I'll try it.	Nja kugezaako.
I’m in the hospital.	Nze ndi mu ddwaaliro.
We’re going to have to do that.	Ekyo tugenda kuba tulina okukikola.
Doing this would be difficult.	Okukola kino kyandibadde kizibu.
I still can’t quite believe it.	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kukkiriza ddala.
I am now refreshed.	Nze kati nfunye amaanyi.
I could feel it happening.	Nnali mpulira nga kigenda mu maaso.
She says she would rather spend time with him alone.	Agamba nti yandibadde asinga kumala budde naye yekka.
You don’t have to do anything.	Tolina kukola kintu kyonna.
However, that would be a huge problem early on.	Kyokka, ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo nga bukyali.
Can anyone else see the problem with this .	Waliwo omuntu omulala yenna asobola okulaba obuzibu ku kino .
I’m in school, you know.	Nze ndi mu ssomero, omanyi.
But someone had to do it.	Naye waliwo omuntu yalina okukikola.
It’s very, very simple.	Kyangu nnyo nnyo.
This is simply not true.	Kino si kituufu kyokka.
No one knows anyone.	Tewali amanyi muntu yenna.
But there is no harm in that.	Naye tewali bulabe bwonna mu ekyo.
As it always is.	Nga bulijjo bwe kiri.
He has no reason.	Talina nsonga.
But he thought he knew.	Naye yalowooza nti amanyi.
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
I have no problem with that.	Ekyo sirina buzibu bwonna.
Now he seemed constantly uptight.	Kati yali alabika nga buli kiseera alina ekizibu.
Either way, we have no choice.	Mu ngeri yonna, tetulina kya kukola.
In practice this is not always true.	Mu nkola kino si kituufu bulijjo.
But he says no luck.	Naye agamba nti tewali mukisa.
He will be asleep almost soon.	Ajja kuba yeebase kumpi mu bbanga ttono.
But there was no one.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna.
Clearly, that was his problem.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo kye kyali ekizibu kye.
I already knew everyone in the class.	Buli muntu mu kibiina nnali mmanyi dda.
I hope he is happy.	Nsuubira nti musanyufu.
I'll be back soon.	Nja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
And it would be true, of course.	Era kyandibadde kituufu, ddala.
Yeah we're going.	Ye tugenda.
And yet somehow he was still so good.	Era naye waliwo engeri gye yali akyali mulungi nnyo.
We are here to see .	Tuli wano okulaba .
I need help, Dad.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi taata.
My job, you know.	Omulimu gwange, omanyi.
That was good when he needed to be.	Ekyo yali mulungi nga yeetaaga okuba.
In a very, very short time.	Mu bbanga ttono nnyo nnyo.
What, he didn't know.	Kiki, yali tamanyi.
That was true then and it is true now.	Ekyo kyali kituufu mu kiseera ekyo era bwe kiri kati.
I want you.	Njagala ggwe.
We’ll just have to see about this.	Tujja kumala kulaba ku nsonga eno.
He didn’t want to talk to me.	Yali tayagala kwogera nange.
He wasn’t much.	Yali si nnyo.
I hope you know what it is.	Nsuubira nti omanyi kye kiri.
He knew you would come back.	Yali akimanyi nti ojja kudda.
This is why you are so dangerous.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki oli wa bulabe nnyo.
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
He without any reason.	Ye nga talina nsonga yonna.
Or he spoke.	Oba yayogera.
I am the only one.	Nze nze nzekka.
He agreed strongly.	Yakkiriza nnyo.
He wanted to back away but couldn’t.	Yali ayagala okudda emabega naye nga tasobola.
In fact, you could say .	Mu butuufu oyinza okugamba nti .
He knew they weren’t.	Yali akimanyi nti si bwe bali.
He didn’t deserve that.	Ekyo yali tasaanidde.
I really can’t say.	Mazima ddala sisobola kwogera.
And a little happier.	Era nga musanyufu katono.
I love this product.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino.
Scheduling is not an issue.	Enteekateeka si nsonga.
The police are coming.	Poliisi ejja.
Very good, very very good.	Mulungi nnyo, mulungi nnyo nnyo.
I was happy at the time.	Nali musanyufu mu kiseera ekyo.
And very soon, you’ll probably be where.	Era mu bbanga ttono ddala, osanga ojja kuba wa.
Nothing was going well.	Tewali kyali kigenda bulungi.
Now I was busy.	Kati nnali bbize.
That’s true, and it’s true.	Ekyo kituufu, era kituufu.
It’s not as easy as it sounds.	Si kyangu nga bwe kirabika.
Today is his chance to see things.	Leero gwe mukisa gwe okulaba ebintu.
It was very dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
He could not .	Yali tasobola .
And he was going.	Era yali agenda.
He always knew what he was thinking.	Bulijjo yali amanyi kye yali alowooza.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Era si kibi.
He wants to work hard.	Ayagala kukola nnyo.
Here we don’t have it.	Wano tetulina.
Something is happening here.	Wano waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
I really didn’t want anything.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kintu kyonna.
He certainly didn’t deserve this.	Mazima ddala kino yali tasaanidde.
You probably don’t know that there is such a problem.	Oboolyawo tomanyi nti waliwo ekizibu ng’ekyo.
I think we’ll all play.	Ndowooza ffenna tujja kuzannya.
I’ll come to you.	Nja kujja gy’oli.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Yali asobola okukola kyonna kye yali ayagala.
It would have been me.	Kyandibadde nze.
He probably didn’t have time .	Oboolyawo yali talina budde .
You don’t have to talk about me.	Tolina kwogera ku nze.
Work, work.	Omulimu, omulimu.
I’m really not much of a musician.	Mazima ddala siri nnyo muyimbi.
You can’t do that everywhere.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola buli wamu.
I know it was good.	Nkimanyi nti kyali kirungi.
We are a process.	Tuli nkola.
I 'm the only one	Nze nzekka .
He didn't know what he was thinking.	Yali tamanyi kye yali alowooza.
It seems you are a dangerous man to know.	Kirabika oli musajja wa bulabe okumanya.
I had no idea what it was.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki.
We have, we have .	Tulina, tulina .
You won’t be able to.	Tojja kusobola.
But there is nothing like this.	Naye tewali kintu nga kino.
This is both a good and a bad thing.	Kino kintu kirungi era kibi.
I think it would be.	Ndowooza bwe kyandibadde.
He doesn’t need to do that.	Teyeetaaga kukola ekyo.
He doesn’t want to be here.	Tayagala kubeera wano.
He looked completely normal.	Yalabika nga wa bulijjo ddala.
You’re afraid, and that’s all good.	Otya, era ekyo kyonna kirungi.
You just have to go.	Olina okugenda kyokka.
But this doesn’t seem to be true.	Naye kino kirabika si kituufu.
She looked great tonight.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo ekiro kino.
I won’t try that again.	Ekyo sijja kuddamu kugezaako.
He is one of us now.	Ye omu ku ffe kati.
We need one more person.	Twetaaga omuntu omulala omu.
What, who knows.	Kiki, ani amanyi.
That's just me.	Oyo nze nzekka.
Just like everyone else.	Nga buli muntu omulala.
Everyone wanted to be with him.	Buli omu yali ayagala okubeera naye.
I loved this book.	Ekitabo kino nnali njagala nnyo.
It is very close to the office.	Kiri kumpi nnyo ne ofiisi.
I, well .	Nze, bulungi .
His work is not good.	Omulimu gwe si mulungi.
They were old friends now.	Baali ba mukwano gwa dda kati.
That was sudden.	Ekyo kyali kya mangu.
He could not respond or function at all.	Yali tasobola kuddamu wadde okukola n’akatono.
It’s just good.	Kirungi kyokka.
He just didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi kyokka.
That’s just fine.	Ekyo kirungi kyokka.
You are like	Oli nga .
We go as far as we can.	Tugenda nga bwe tusobola.
He could drive home.	Yali asobola okuvuga mmotoka okudda eka.
It would be him.	Kyandibadde ye.
I want to be a father.	Njagala kubeera taata.
He was so nice to talk to.	Yali mulungi nnyo okwogera naye.
You have to get out of here.	Olina okuva wano.
Tom couldn't wait.	Tom yali tasobola kulinda.
Where are you?.	Oli wa?.
The whole thing is easy to read.	Ekintu kyonna kyangu okusoma.
Perhaps that was the problem.	Oboolyawo ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
He doesn’t have a good one.	Talina mulungi.
He looked very happy.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo.
You were there.	Ggwe wali awo.
There is no reason for us to work.	Tewali nsonga lwaki tulina okukola.
In fact, it’s much more complicated than that.	Mu butuufu, kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I don’t quite know what to say.	Simanyi bulungi kya kwogera.
This is a very important time.	Kino kiseera kikulu nnyo.
I am now in good shape.	Kati ndi mu mbeera nnungi.
He was sick.	Yali mulwadde.
My only problem is.	Ekizibu kyange kyokka kiri nti.
And in any case, everyone should.	Era mu ngeri yonna, buli muntu yandibadde.
Everyone could go home.	Buli muntu yali asobola okudda eka.
It’s not just that.	Si ekyo kyokka.
I doubt it will happen.	Nbuusabuusa oba kijja kubaawo.
He did what he came to do.	Yakola kye yajja okukola.
But this is not why we are here.	Naye eno si y’ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
And it was very dangerous.	Era kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
Or all night long.	Oba ekiro kyonna.
We can know many things.	Tusobola okumanya ebintu bingi.
He got a job.	Yafuna omulimu.
No one looked good.	Tewali yali alabika bulungi.
Everything is your own.	Buli kimu kya ggwe kennyini.
This book was excellent.	Ekitabo kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
He didn't know why.	Yali tamanyi lwaki.
Perhaps, in one place.	Mpozzi, mu kifo kimu.
I can’t see how.	Sisobola kulaba ngeri.
That wasn’t quite right.	Ekyo kyali si kituufu nnyo.
This issue comes up in many situations.	Ensonga eno ejja mu mbeera nnyingi.
Perhaps he was afraid too.	Oboolyawo naye yali atya.
But who can speak.	Naye ani ayinza okwogera.
Except, perhaps, for you.	Okuggyako, oboolyawo, ku ggwe.
And so did I.	Era nange.
I need someone here.	Nze nneetaaga omuntu wano.
But he knows what is important to me.	Naye amanyi kye kikulu gyendi.
We will do the same.	Naffe tujja kukola kye kimu.
Nothing could be worse.	Tewali kiyinza kubaawo kibi okusinga kino.
It is his office.	Ye ofiisi ye.
He is also a singer and a musician.	Era muyimbi era muyimbi.
No one can help anyone.	Tewali asobola kuyamba muntu yenna.
None of the men are asleep.	Tewali musajja yenna yeebase.
Nothing too complicated.	Tewali kintu kizibu nnyo.
There is no way.	Tewali ngeri yonna.
Too bad for me though.	Kibi nnyo gyendi wadde.
No one here knows how to do it.	Wano tewali amanyi kukikola.
But he doesn’t have it.	Naye talina.
I got a job in the morning.	Nfunye omulimu ku makya.
I didn’t want to deal with that.	Ekyo nnali saagala kukola ku nsonga eyo.
There is hope for everyone.	Waliwo essuubi eri buli muntu.
He knew he needed help.	Yali akimanyi nti yeetaaga obuyambi.
It was in him alone, that was all.	Kyali mu ye yekka, ekyo kyokka kye kyali.
But it looked good.	Naye nga kirabika bulungi.
Even when he was a child.	Ne bwe yali mwana muto.
But of course it could be, it could be anyone.	Naye ddala kiyinza okuba, kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
He was everything to me.	Yali buli kimu gyendi.
In, like, a day.	Mu, nga, olunaku.
One thing we can do.	Ekintu kimu kye tusobola okukola.
I have no problem with that.	Ekyo sirina buzibu bwonna.
I don’t know what to do with me.	Nze simanyi kya kukola nange.
There is just nothing there.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyokka awo.
No place was right.	Tewali kifo kyonna kyali kituufu.
I want to know what it is.	Njagala okumanya kye kiri.
I love driving that thing.	Njagala nnyo okuvuga ekintu ekyo.
I’m the same.	Nze kye kimu.
He can beat everyone.	Asobola okukuba buli muntu.
That’s really why.	Eyo ddala y’ensonga lwaki.
This is not realistic.	Kino si kya ddala.
You were the problem.	Ggwe wali obuzibu.
But he just couldn’t seem to do it.	Naye yali alabika nga tasobola kukikola.
Now that’s a thing of the past.	Kati ekyo kintu kya dda.
As he was.	Nga bwe yali.
You’ve always been so friendly.	Bulijjo obadde wa mukwano nnyo.
This I can say.	Kino nsobola okwogera.
In the prison.	Mu kkomera.
But it comes close.	Naye kijja kumpi.
I don’t know what it is.	Nze simanyi kye kiri.
He was on to something.	Yali ku kintu.
That goes for weekends as well.	Ekyo kigenda ne ku wiikendi.
In that case nothing matters.	Mu mbeera eyo tewali kikulu.
Not too much of anything there.	Si bingi nnyo ku kintu kyonna awo.
Not a problem, by any means.	Si kizibu, mu ngeri yonna.
We are strong.	Tuli ba maanyi.
And no one can believe it is true.	Era tewali ayinza kukkiriza nti kituufu.
You’re not ready.	Toli mwetegefu.
All she wanted was a child.	Kye yali ayagala yali mwana.
He came to help.	Yajja okuyamba.
It’s a great car for anyone.	Mmotoka nnungi nnyo eri omuntu yenna.
He won’t eat eat.	Tajja kulya kulya.
He was too young, he said.	Yali muto nnyo, bwe yagambye.
I think that’s very important.	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo.
You, too.	Ggwe, nange.
Knowing where he went and why.	Okumanya gye yagenda ne lwaki.
But it was a good movie.	Naye yali firimu nnungi.
Not alone, alone.	Si yekka, yekka.
That is theoretically what it is.	Ekyo mu ndowooza kye kiri.
He'll come.	Ajja kujja.
Or his girlfriend.	Oba muganzi we.
And my week.	Ne wiiki yange.
It matters to you, it matters to all of us.	Kikulu gyoli, kikulu gye tuli ffenna.
This is difficult to do.	Kino kizibu okukola.
I loved my dog.	Embwa yange nnali njagala nnyo.
But he was here.	Naye yali wano.
I'm not sure anyone does right now.	Sikakasa nti waliwo akola mu kiseera kino.
Everyone wants it.	Buli omu ayagala.
Seems like yesterday to me.	Kirabika nga jjo gyendi.
He was completely ordinary.	Yali wa bulijjo ddala.
In this case.	Mu mbeera eno.
That was my take on it.	Eyo ye yali endowooza yange ku nsonga eyo.
And it doesn’t matter what you want, either.	Era si kikulu ky’oyagala, era.
But it’s not true.	Naye si kituufu.
And we’ll see.	Era tujja kulaba.
He is very sick.	Ali mulwadde nnyo.
Will be back soon.	Ajja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
It’s not like that for everyone.	Si bwe kiri eri buli muntu.
But that was the point.	Naye eyo ye yali ensonga.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
Here is his chance.	Wano we wali omukisa gwe.
It’s really quite simple.	Ddala kyangu nnyo.
But that’s not who he is.	Naye ekyo si ky’ali.
That will buy time.	Ekyo kijja kugula obudde.
We have to talk.	Tulina okwogera.
He worked hard though.	Yakola nnyo wadde.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
I wish she was here to see this.	Njagala nnyo nga yandibadde wano okulaba kino.
In a way it’s good that you’re not him.	Mu ngeri emu kirungi nti toli ye.
He is in the background.	Ali emabega.
Very early, actually.	Nga bukyali nnyo, mu butuufu.
It's not you.	Si ggwe.
I hope he does.	Nsuubira nti akikola.
That was one thing.	Ekyo kyali kimu.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
Now there is none.	Kati tewali.
. . . .	.
And apparently he heard nothing.	Era kirabika tewali kye yawulira.
He always had his way.	Bulijjo yalina engeri ye.
We cannot accept that.	Ekyo tetusobola kukkiriza.
I love this picture.	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi kino.
We both needed that.	Ekyo ffembi twali twetaaga.
He knew a lot.	Yali amanyi bingi.
However, that was very common.	Kyokka, ekyo kyali kya bulijjo nnyo.
I need to talk to him too.	Nange nneetaaga okwogera naye.
Someone else did it.	Omuntu omulala yakikola.
Not one person.	Si muntu omu.
His problem was himself.	Ekizibu kye yali ye kennyini.
However, that is not all.	Kyokka, ekyo si kye kyokka.
It’s really quite simple.	Ddala kyangu nnyo.
You have to find one reason.	Olina okufuna ensonga emu.
I think he's in trouble.	Ndowooza ali mu buzibu.
And there’s really no problem.	Era mu butuufu tewali buzibu bwonna.
But this wasn’t the only problem.	Naye kino si kye kyali ekizibu kyokka.
I will do this again.	Kino nja kuddamu okukola.
As a person.	Nga omuntu.
It was the way he wanted it.	Yali ngeri gye yali ayagala.
I guess you probably do.	Ntebereza nti osanga okola.
Of course, the problem is not immediate.	Kya lwatu nti ekizibu si kya mangu.
He is not happy.	Si musanyufu.
Not everyone can work here.	Si buli muntu nti asobola okukola wano.
That, of course is fine as well.	Ekyo, ddala kiri bulungi nga bwe kiri.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Era si kibi.
But there was no car.	Naye nga tewali mmotoka.
It’s time to act.	Kye kiseera okukola.
You’re going to go into practice.	Ogenda kugenda mu nkola.
That’s not too difficult.	Ekyo si kizibu nnyo.
I actually have to do it.	Mu butuufu nnina okukikola.
I’m not sure that’s the case.	Sikakasa nti bwe kiri.
And, of course, there is energy.	Era, ddala, waliwo amaanyi.
I know exactly what is what.	Nze mmanyi bulungi kiki kiki.
Will try that.	Ajja kugezaako ekyo.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
It’s much easier that way.	Kyangu nnyo mu ngeri eyo.
But the beautiful one.	Naye omulungi.
I have had the very same problem.	Nze nfunye ekizibu kye kimu ennyo.
He said he has.	Yagambye nti alina...
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kirungi.
What he got help with.	Kye yafuna obuyambi.
You’re the only one.	Ggwe wekka.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
Right behind him.	Emabega we ddala.
Not a good relationship.	Si mukwano mulungi.
And he did this.	Era kino yakikola.
I can’t believe this.	Kino siyinza kukkiriza.
And yet everyone is alone.	Era naye buli omu ali yekka.
However, you can also.	Kyokka era osobola.
I guess there is.	Ntebereza nti waliwo.
Your point is mine.	Ensonga yo yange.
He doesn't want to talk.	Tayagala kwogera.
You really can.	Ddala osobola.
He seems to know so much.	Alabika amanyi bingi nnyo.
But that’s neither here nor there.	Naye ekyo si wano wadde awo.
He was right behind her.	Yali emabega we ddala.
This is not a good practice.	Eno si nkola nnungi.
I don’t know where to go.	Nze simanyi gye nnyinza kugenda.
I am very, very hungry.	Nze enjala nnyingi nnyo.
He shouldn’t have done that.	Ekyo yali tasaanidde kukikola.
He was always very strong.	Bulijjo yali wa maanyi nnyo.
It’s a powerful thing to do.	Kintu kya maanyi okukola.
He may well have done so.	Ayinza bulungi okuba nga yakikola.
I plan to be there.	Nteekateeka kubeerawo.
He did very well.	Yakola bulungi nnyo.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
In fact, it was bad.	Mu butuufu, kyali kibi.
I needed help in the shower.	Nnali nneetaaga obuyambi mu ssaawa.
No one knows what that is.	Tewali amanyi ekyo kye ki.
Not going fast.	Si kugenda mangu.
He knows it well.	Amanyi bulungi.
I was everything.	Nze nali buli kimu.
But maybe it was too good.	Naye mpozzi nga kyali kirungi nnyo.
You, or someone like you.	Ggwe, oba omuntu nga ggwe.
It was about moving forward.	Kyali kya kugenda mu maaso.
Although, today .	Wadde nga, leero .
And it was, and it is.	Era kyali, era kiri.
Obviously not at the same time.	Kya lwatu nti si mu kiseera kye kimu.
I just wanted to do it right.	Nnali njagala kukikola bulungi kyokka.
He just has to do it.	Alina okukikola kyokka.
So far, he’s a good friend, as of now.	N’okutuusa kati, mukwano gwange mulungi, nga kati.
Are you ready?.	Oli mwetegefu?.
Everyone was still busy.	Buli omu yali akyali bbize.
In good time.	Mu budde obulungi.
That is not the case here.	Ekyo si bwe kiri wano.
No, he couldn’t.	Nedda, yali tasobola.
You know exactly what that was.	Omanyi bulungi ekyo kye kyali.
We will return to that point below.	Tujja kudda ku nsonga eyo wansi.
Surely you are.	Mazima ddala ggwe oli.
The reading is ongoing.	Okusoma kugenda mu maaso.
He will be good.	Ajja kuba mulungi.
He talked to me for about an hour.	Yayogera nange okumala essaawa nga emu.
Perhaps he could be too.	Oboolyawo naye ayinza okuba bw’atyo.
He was an excellent doctor.	Yali musawo mulungi nnyo.
This is a difficult time for us.	Kino kiseera kizibu gye tuli.
No one seems interested.	Tewali alabika ayagala.
I don't want anything for this.	Kino saagala kintu kyonna.
It’s not necessarily a good thing.	Si kituufu nti kintu kirungi.
He did well to think.	Yakola bulungi okulowooza.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Era si kibi.
I think he was really just lonely.	Ndowooza ddala yali yekka yekka.
However, this would be much easier.	Kyokka kino kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
He is very, very young.	Muto nnyo nnyo.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Naye si kibi.
Here we have what we need.	Wano tulina bye twetaaga.
No one really knew.	Tewali yali amanyi ddala.
I feel ready to go.	Mpulira nga ndi mwetegefu okugenda.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
Maybe there is no problem.	Mpozzi tewali buzibu bwonna.
Obviously we were.	Kya lwatu nti twali.
But he couldn’t live with her.	Naye yali tasobola kubeera naye.
That's why we were there.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki twali awo.
How beautiful of him.	Nga mulungi nnyo ku ye.
But of course this is not true.	Naye mazima kino si kituufu.
I do, a lot.	Nze nkola, nnyo.
It’s hard to see.	Kizibu okulaba.
Maybe, but probably not.	Mpozzi, naye oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
And he knows that he knows it.	Era akimanyi nti akimanyi.
He couldn't say exactly why.	Yali tasobola kwogera bulungi lwaki.
He is very happy.	Ye musanyufu nnyo.
We can do it here.	Tusobola okukikola wano.
This can continue throughout the night.	Kino kiyinza okugenda mu maaso ekiro kyonna.
It seems to all of us soon.	Kirabika eri ffenna mu bbanga ttono.
No one is happy, but no one can do it.	Tewali musanyufu, naye tewali asobola kukikola.
I just think he will.	Nze ndowooza kyokka nti ajja kukikola.
I almost thought of calling.	Nali kumpi ne ndowooza okukuba essimu.
But that’s just me.	Naye oyo nze nzekka.
So far, no one can.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali asobola.
You know, but it's my job.	Omanyi naye gwe mulimu gwange.
It would be very dangerous.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe nnyo.
What he looked sick of.	Kye yali alabika nga mulwadde.
As is the case with us.	Nga bwe kiri ku ffe.
He was a man.	Yali muntu...
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
In fact, it was awful.	Mu butuufu, kyali kibi nnyo.
And, in fact, it is.	Era, mu butuufu, bwe kiri.
I said, yes, of course.	Nagamba nti, ye, ddala.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
Only one will work.	Omu yekka y’ajja okukola.
This is what is happening in your case.	Kino kye kigenda mu maaso mu mbeera yo.
I know they’re there.	Nkimanyi nti bali awo.
Maybe you’ll be lucky.	Mpozzi ojja kuba wa mukisa.
He was suddenly very good.	Yali mulungi nnyo mu bwangu.
He didn’t want to be here.	Yali tayagala kubeera wano.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
It’s a real moment.	Kiseera kya ddala.
And who has him.	Era ani alina ye.
It was a very important one.	Kyali kikulu nnyo.
I hope you can do the same.	Nsuubira nti naawe osobola okukola kye kimu.
And he could see why.	Era yali asobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
In fact, he had already started.	Mu butuufu yali yatandika dda.
You go to the house.	Ggwe ogenda mu nnyumba.
I feel very passionate about that.	Ekyo mpulira nga njagala nnyo.
He could say whatever he wanted.	Yali asobola okwogera kyonna kye yali ayagala.
This is a good plan.	Eno nteekateeka nnungi.
Or work, of course.	Oba omulimu, ddala.
For each other.	Ku lwa buli omu.
And nobody really knows that.	Era ekyo mu butuufu tewali akimanyi.
You want to know why.	Oyagala okumanya lwaki.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
He spoke a lot.	Yayogera nnyo.
This may work, but it may not.	Kino kiyinza okukola, naye kiyinza obutakola.
Apparently it was at this time.	Kirabika kyali mu kiseera kino.
Everyone is very well.	Buli muntu ali bulungi nnyo.
I’ll go, and the money.	Nja kugenda, ne ssente.
We were going to be a problem.	Twali tugenda kuba kizibu.
I don’t have anything of the sort.	Sirina kintu kyonna kya ngeri eyo.
He doesn’t want anything.	Tayagala kintu kyonna.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
It will come to me.	Kijja kujja gyendi.
He will just do it.	Ajja kumala kukikola.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
It’s certainly not a problem.	Mazima ddala si kizibu.
He has always been very willing to talk to her.	Bulijjo abadde mwetegefu nnyo okwogera naye.
He was like that	Yali bw'atyo .
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
No one has a problem with that.	Ekyo tewali alina buzibu.
What a practical idea!.	Nga ndowooza ya nkola!.
This is obviously a big problem for the job.	Kino kirabika obuzibu bungi eri omulimu.
He is a real person.	Ye muntu ddala.
I have to work.	Nnina okukola.
It doesn’t really matter.	Mu butuufu si kikulu.
Anyone can tell anyone anything, anytime.	Omuntu yenna asobola okubuulira omuntu yenna ekintu kyonna, essaawa yonna.
I will be that guy.	Nze nja kuba ggaayi oyo.
It’s a lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi nnyo.
And not much money at all.	Era nga tewali nnyo ssente n’akatono.
This is definitely a very good thing.	Kino mazima ddala kintu kirungi nnyo.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
Although everything seems right.	Wadde nga buli kimu kirabika nga kituufu.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
However, he really didn't have to.	Kyokka ddala yali talina kukikola.
He moved forward quickly.	Yagenda mu maaso mu bwangu.
But you have another one.	Naye ggwe olina omulala.
Really, very young.	Ddala, muto nnyo.
And, of course, in a sense this is true.	Era, ddala, mu ngeri emu kino kituufu.
All one person.	Byonna muntu omu.
He is not happy.	Si musanyufu.
It was so quick and easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo era kyangu nnyo.
He just didn’t want to talk.	Yali tayagala kwogera kyokka.
It includes everyone.	Mulimu buli muntu.
I'm fine with that.	Ekyo ndi bulungi.
But it’s happening very well right now.	Naye kigenda mu maaso bulungi nnyo mu kiseera kino.
No one is working.	Tewali muntu yenna akola.
He said he was doing it.	Yagambye nti akikola.
We have to go now.	Tulina okugenda kati.
That wasn’t the issue.	Eyo si ye yali ensonga.
I think it will be good.	Ndowooza kijja kuba kirungi.
Perhaps it was him.	Oboolyawo ye yali.
He was moving forward.	Yali agenda mu maaso.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kye kimu.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
This is not romantic.	Kino si kya mukwano.
I have to do something to help my father.	Nnina kye nnina okukola okuyamba taata.
It was indeed intense.	Mazima ddala kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
I don’t think he’s afraid.	Sirowooza nti atya.
He was in such trouble.	Yali mu buzibu bw’atyo.
Not that he was afraid.	Si nti yali atya.
But he really knows what he wants.	Naye ddala amanyi ky’ayagala.
It was just the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu kyokka.
And you were .	Era wali .
You have to get to that quickly.	Ekyo olina okutuuka amangu.
Being alone is not a problem for me.	Okubeera nzekka si kizibu gyendi.
That’s probably where it is.	Oboolyawo awo we kiri.
Not at all, not at all.	Si bwe kiri n’akatono, si bwe kiri n’akatono.
It was his reason to come back.	Yali nsonga ye okudda.
To strike as .	Okukuba nga .
Not even him.	Si wadde ye.
But they were there.	Naye baali awo.
I’m doing my job.	Nze nkola omulimu gwange.
You will remain safe.	Ojja kusigala nga tolina bulabe.
We cannot accept this position.	Tetusobola kukkiriza kifo kino.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Mpozzi, mpozzi, mpozzi.
You should see my house.	Olina okulaba ennyumba yange.
Now he says he loves it.	Kati agamba nti ayagala nnyo.
And he always would be.	Era bulijjo yandibadde bw’atyo.
I don’t know how to love anyone.	Simanyi kwagala muntu yenna.
But that wasn’t the case now.	Naye ekyo si bwe kyali kati.
He will not be a problem.	Tajja kuba kizibu.
I needed time alone.	Nnali nneetaaga obudde nzekka.
But that’s just not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
That was definitely it.	Ekyo kyali mazima ddala.
And everyone seems to love it.	Era buli omu alabika ayagala nnyo.
He looks much better than either of us.	Alabika bulungi nnyo okusinga omu ku ffe.
But it is not at all.	Naye si bwe kiri n’akatono.
Not today, my brother.	Si leero muganda wange.
He said he would be in the car.	Yagambye nti ajja kuba mu mmotoka.
I don’t want to do it.	Saagala kukikola.
He was my man.	Yali muntu wange.
Probably true, in a way.	Oboolyawo nga kituufu, mu ngeri emu.
I am alone with him.	Nze naye yekka.
She loved her dog.	Yali ayagala nnyo embwa ye.
I feel better already.	Nze mpulira bulungi dda.
I know you can do it.	Nkimanyi nti osobola okukikola.
That’s why he was here.	Y’ensonga lwaki yali wano.
That, of course, is not the case.	Ekyo, ddala, si bwe kiri.
I have to be as safe as everyone else here.	Nnina okuba nga sirina buzibu nga buli muntu omulala wano.
But he was happy to be home.	Naye yali musanyufu okuba awaka.
He will know everything.	Ajja kumanya buli kimu.
Not quite three.	Si ssatu nnyo.
It is a good time to buy any car.	Kiseera kirungi okugula mmotoka yonna.
This is not a difficult thing.	Kino si kintu kizibu.
I want to be sick.	Njagala kubeera mulwadde.
You might say that’s fine.	Oyinza okugamba nti ekyo kirungi.
You don’t seem to have it.	Ggwe olabika tolina.
It’s not at all the right thing to do.	Si kintu kituufu n’akatono okukola.
The same thing is happening.	Ekintu kye kimu kye kigenda mu maaso.
He doesn’t deserve one.	Tasaanidde emu.
But he knew it was true.	Naye yali akimanyi nti kituufu.
It comes down to attitude.	Kijja wansi ku ndowooza.
There’s a police station there.	Eyo waliwo poliisi.
No, it's not wrong.	Nedda si kibi.
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okukikola.
Of course, he would.	Kya lwatu nti yandikoze.
And it is dangerous, very dangerous.	Era kya bulabe, kya bulabe nnyo.
But you’re the only one at home.	Naye ggwe wekka awaka.
I certainly can.	Mazima ddala nsobola.
He's been around for a long time.	Abadde bbanga ddene.
But in this case .	Naye mu mbeera eno .
Good for that.	Kirungi ku ekyo.
But not everything.	Naye si buli kimu.
I could get behind this.	Nnali nsobola okutuuka emabega wa kino.
It will not be repeatable.	Tekijja kuba kya kuddamu kukola.
He always did that.	Ekyo bulijjo yali akikola.
But he tried.	Naye yagezaako.
Today during the.	Leero mu kiseera kya...
He's been in that.	Abadde mu ekyo.
Here, that was not the case.	Wano, ekyo si bwe kyali.
But this is not true.	Naye kino si kituufu.
You can’t stay ahead.	Tosobola kusigala mu maaso.
What he wanted.	Kye yali ayagala.
Everyone was so nice.	Buli omu yali mulungi nnyo.
It’s hard to do it.	Kizibu okukikola.
He could see no reason for one.	Yali tasobola kulaba nsonga lwaki emu.
But now is not the time.	Naye kati si kye kiseera.
To be with his friend.	Okubeera ne mukwano gwe.
This is a very serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
We can’t do it alone.	Tetusobola kukikola ffekka.
That’s not a good reason.	Ekyo si nsonga nnungi.
I am a good man.	Nze musajja mulungi.
He comes with his wife.	Ajja ne mukyala we.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
Not that it’s a bad idea.	Si nti kirowoozo kibi.
That’s not going to be me.	Ekyo si kye kigenda kubeera nze.
No, not necessarily, no.	Nedda, si kituufu nti, nedda.
I feel alone.	Mpulira nga ndi nzekka.
I think it’s very important.	Ndowooza kikulu nnyo.
He is still here.	Akyali wano.
I want to have time to get to the answer.	Njagala okufuna obudde okutuuka ku kuddamu.
I know you can.	Nkimanyi nti osobola.
He doesn’t need any trouble.	Teyeetaaga buzibu bwonna.
For today, he thought.	Lwa leero, bwe yalowooza.
He didn’t want help.	Yali tayagala buyambi.
That would just be today.	Ekyo kyandibadde leero kyokka.
So far that’s what it is.	N’okutuusa kati ekyo kye kiri.
Not until the evening.	Si okutuusa akawungeezi.
And he said he would go get help.	Era yagamba nti agenda kugenda okufuna obuyambi.
These are not those though.	Bino si bye ebyo wadde.
It looks good.	Kirabika kirungi.
I’m glad you’re good.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli mulungi.
He is everywhere.	Ali buli wamu.
He would have to go.	Yandibadde alina okugenda.
Take a picture.	Kuba ekifaananyi.
We have hope.	Tulina essuubi.
I thought you were.	Nnalowooza nti ggwe oli.
Excellent work.	Omulimu omulungi ennyo.
He knew he was good at his job.	Yali akimanyi nti mulungi mu mulimu gwe.
He did, you know.	Yakikola, omanyi.
He tried hard.	Yagezaako amaanyi.
Everyone here knows that.	Buli muntu ali wano ekyo akimanyi.
I thought it would help.	Nalowooza nti kijja kuyamba.
No one knows everything.	Tewali amanyi buli kimu.
It’s hard to say he’s on side.	Kizibu okugamba nti ali ku ludda.
Everything was great.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi nnyo.
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t.	Sisobola, sisobola, sisobola.
Everyone wants money.	Buli muntu ayagala ssente.
I was in school.	Nnali mu ssomero.
I couldn’t answer.	Nnali sisobola kuddamu.
That was probably a good thing.	Ekyo oboolyawo kyali kirungi.
And there’s a lot.	Era waliwo bingi.
Not exactly well, as it turned out.	Si ddala bulungi, nga bwe kyali.
This was all very difficult.	Kino kyonna kyali kizibu nnyo.
We will do it .	Tujja kukikola .
This is just dangerous.	Kino kya bulabe kyokka.
I have nothing to fear.	Sirina kye ntya.
It will always come back true.	Bulijjo kijja kudda nga kituufu.
That is still true today.	Ekyo kituufu n’okutuusa leero.
He loved food.	Yali ayagala nnyo emmere.
Maybe you’re ready to buy this.	Mpozzi nga oli mwetegefu okugula kino.
He didn’t need to do that.	Ekyo yali teyeetaaga kukikola.
Like, really sick.	Nga, ddala mulwadde.
You seem to know a lot about this.	Olabika omanyi bingi ku nsonga eno.
Not like in the movies.	Si nga mu firimu.
Apparently, he did.	Kirabika nti yakikola.
But it is not true in every case.	Naye si kituufu mu buli mbeera.
It was dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe.
Someone has to know.	Omuntu alina okumanya.
I couldn’t even.	Nnali sisobola wadde.
There is only one thing we can do now.	Waliwo ekintu kimu kyokka kye tusobola okukola kati.
Not anything, though.	Si kintu kyonna, wadde.
My father was my only father.	Taata yali taata wange yekka.
He could do it, he knew it.	Yali asobola okukikola, yali akimanyi.
And it was, and it was.	Era bwe kyali, era yali.
Anyone would, in turn.	Omuntu yenna yandikoze, mu kifo kye.
You don’t have to do everything alone.	Tolina kukola buli kimu wekka.
No one at all .	Tewali muntu yenna n'akatono .
Something for everyone there!.	Ekintu kya buli muntu ali eyo!.
You have to talk to me.	Olina okwogera nange.
He was going to be fine.	Yali agenda kuba bulungi.
However, he did not want to do that.	Kyokka, ekyo yali tayagala kukikola.
But it’s pretty good.	Naye kirungi nnyo.
What a friendly experience.	Nga kya mukwano nnyo.
What he did	Kye yakola .
He would have fallen asleep.	Yandibadde yeebase.
That won’t be enough.	Ekyo tekijja kumala.
I am as happy as I can be.	Ndi musanyufu nga bwe nsobola.
Not that it matters now.	Si nti kikulu kati.
But it’s not him.	Naye si ye.
I had no idea myself.	Nze kennyini nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
I will try to go home early.	Nja kugezaako okudda eka nga bukyali.
He is very beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo.
It’s not something as simple as that.	Si kintu kyangu nga ekyo.
However, it is not true.	Kyokka, si kituufu.
But he tried anyway.	Naye yagezaako mu ngeri yonna.
He didn’t need anything.	Yali talina kye yeetaaga.
And that’s really a problem.	Era ekyo ddala kizibu.
It was a problem.	Yali buzibu.
He was obviously a good man.	Kya lwatu nti yali muntu mulungi.
But he felt the same way.	Naye naye yawulira bw’atyo.
I wanted to know.	Nnali njagala okumanya.
And true and normal.	Era nga kituufu era nga kya bulijjo.
There was nothing he could do about it now.	Tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eno kati.
There is absolutely no one here.	Wano tewali muntu yenna n’akatono.
In truth, it’s all a way of thinking.	Mu mazima, byonna ngeri ya ndowooza.
But now you have to think.	Naye kati olina okulowooza.
This is not your issue.	Eno si nsonga yo.
But no one said much.	Naye tewali yayogera nnyo.
I’m so ready to go to jail.	Nze ndi mwetegefu nnyo okugenda mu kkomera.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
However, that is all he did.	Kyokka, ekyo kyokka kye yakola.
This can happen very quickly.	Kino kiyinza okubaawo mu bwangu nnyo.
He is an ordinary person.	Ye muntu wa bulijjo.
You have such a good one.	Olina omulungi bw’atyo.
But other than that it was him.	Naye okuggyako ekyo yali ye.
He tries it here.	Agezaako wano.
It was a difficult thing.	Kyali kizibu.
It will suddenly be available everywhere.	Kijja kubeerawo mu bwangu buli wamu.
He didn't want to talk about this.	Kino yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eno.
That was good, he thought.	Ekyo kyali kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
I hope we will be friends.	Nsuubira nti tujja kuba ba mukwano.
I have been thinking and thinking about it.	Mbadde ndowooza era nga ndowooza ku nsonga eyo.
I know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi.
He talked to me about it.	Yayogera nange ku nsonga eno.
I know this.	Kino nkimanyi.
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
He would know the guy probably isn’t the only one.	Yandibadde amanyi ggaayi osanga si yekka.
But that was wrong.	Naye ekyo kyali kibi.
That wasn’t what he needed from me.	Ekyo si kye yali yeetaaga okuva gyendi.
I still don't know what to think of this movie.	Nze n'okutuusa kati simanyi kye ndowooza ku firimu eno.
He felt like himself.	Yawulira nga ye kennyini.
This is going to work.	Kino kigenda kukola.
That’s very unusual.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo nnyo.
I think? 	Ndowooza?
Getting to my room.	Okutuuka mu kisenge kyange.
He loves his father.	Ayagala taata we.
My boyfriend has no idea.	Muganzi wange talina kirowoozo kyonna.
He is a dangerous man.	Ye musajja wa bulabe.
For someone like me.	Ku muntu nga nze.
You know, and he was.	Omanyi era ye yali.
He was doing this.	Kino yali akikola.
He is a very good singer.	Muyimbi mulungi nnyo.
He couldn’t tell what they were.	Yali tasobola kumanya kye baali.
I was very sick.	Nnali mulwadde nnyo.
They were almost friends.	Kumpi baali ba mukwano.
You don’t belong here.	Toli wa wano.
Always going to go to go.	Bulijjo okugenda okugenda okugenda.
Night after night everyone.	Ekiro ekiro buli omu.
But nothing, no one.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna, tewali muntu yenna.
I could feel it coming, but couldn’t see anything.	Nali mpulira nga ejja, naye nga sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
Where are you now?.	Kati oli ludda wa?.
Not quite anything.	Si kintu kyonna nnyo.
I was always young.	Bulijjo nnali muto.
He had his own car.	Yalina mmotoka ye.
It looks exactly the same to you.	Kirabika kye kimu ddala gy’oli.
He is very good as well.	Ye mulungi nnyo nga bwe kiri.
And it’s so beautiful.	Era nga kirungi nnyo.
You don’t even have to leave the house.	Tolina wadde okuva mu nnyumba.
I’m with him.	Nze ndi naye.
I know this will work.	Nkimanyi kino kijja kukola.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
You know where you are.	Omanyi gyoli.
He could do with it as he pleased.	Yali asobola okukikola nga bwe yali ayagala.
He's both.	Ye bombi.
That, in a sense, he had.	Ekyo, mu ngeri emu, kye yalina.
Nothing serious here.	Tewali kya maanyi wano.
Perhaps he is with her.	Oboolyawo ali naye.
He would probably do better.	Oboolyawo yandikoze bulungi.
This is normal as well.	Kino kya bulijjo era.
I want more than anything.	Njagala okusinga ekintu kyonna.
Probably what he had.	Oboolyawo kye yalina.
A little while ago .	Akaseera katono emabega .
Everything is bad, bad, bad.	Buli kimu kibi, kibi, kibi.
I’ve been in trouble before.	Nze mbadde mu buzibu emabegako.
Not at all actually.	Si n’akatono mu butuufu.
That’s not quite true.	Ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
But they are.	Naye bwe bali.
I was very young at the time though.	Nali muto nnyo mu kiseera ekyo wadde.
This was very easy.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo.
I do it all.	Byonna nkola.
They were absolutely .	Baali ddala .
That’s something, good.	Ekyo kintu, kirungi.
None did well.	Tewali yakola bulungi.
He couldn’t tell which.	Yali tasobola kumanya ki.
I want to see the plan.	Njagala kulaba nteekateeka.
Today we are going to talk about who did it and why.	Leero tugenda kwogera ku ani yakikola era lwaki.
And there was nobody.	Era nga tewali muntu yenna.
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza.
I was at work.	Nnali ku mulimu.
You are my good friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange omulungi.
He has to be here.	Alina okubeera wano.
It was just a matter of knowing everything.	Yali nsonga ya kumanya buli kimu kyokka.
He doesn’t even know what he wants.	Tamanyi na ky’ayagala.
Which he came into the house.	Kye yajja mu nnyumba.
He had work in the morning.	Yalina omulimu ku makya.
Nothing could happen there.	Tewali kyali kiyinza kubaawo eyo.
We will, we must.	Tujja, tulina.
However, it is not easy and simple by any means.	Kyokka, si kyangu era kyangu nnyo mu ngeri yonna.
But in a sense we are.	Naye mu ngeri emu tuli.
He was a sick child.	Yali mwana mulwadde.
In a sense.	Mu ngeri emu.
But he’s still there.	Naye akyali awo.
I hope he is good for you.	Nsuubira nti mulungi gy’oli.
He doesn’t need to have done what he did.	Teyeetaaga kuba nga yakola ekyo kye yakola.
No, no, that’s not for me.	Nedda, nedda, ekyo si kyange.
He had to do it.	Yalina okukikola.
There is not a single penny.	Tewali ssente emu.
Everyone was asleep.	Buli omu yali yeebase.
That’s not entirely true.	Ekyo si kituufu ddala.
And this is what everyone wants.	Era kino buli muntu ky’ayagala.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
And he tried.	Era yagezaako.
He would have to go to town for that.	Ekyo yandibadde alina okugenda mu kibuga.
I'll be back when you are.	Nja kudda nga oli.
You won’t get in trouble.	Tojja kufuna buzibu.
Now it’s mine.	Kati kyange.
Everything is fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi.
Why this thing.	Lwaki ekintu kino.
He is nowhere to be found.	Talina w’ali.
Reluctantly, at that.	Nga tayagala, ku ekyo.
But he wouldn’t want to eat anything.	Naye yandibadde tayagala kulya kintu kyonna.
This is a conceptually difficult thing.	Kino kintu kizibu mu ndowooza.
I have a job to do here.	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola wano.
He knew exactly where he was.	Yali amanyi bulungi gye yali.
You’re going to do it.	Ogenda kukikola.
It’s easy for me.	Kyangu gyendi.
Something he knew he needed to do.	Ekintu kye yali amanyi nti yeetaaga okukola.
I don’t really know.	Mu butuufu simanyi.
But that’s how it would be from now on.	Naye bwe kyandibadde okuva kati.
It is the quick truth.	Ye mazima amangu.
Apparently they are.	Kirabika bwe bali.
It will	Kijja .
He certainly knew that.	Mazima ddala ekyo yali akimanyi.
We can do it together.	Tusobola okukikola nga tuli wamu.
He had to be ready.	Yalina okuba nga mwetegefu.
Not that it will always help.	Si nti bulijjo kijja kuyamba.
It was great in every way.	Kyali kikulu nnyo mu buli kimu.
He talks about himself.	Ayogera ku ye kennyini.
I think we all have.	Ndowooza ffenna tulina.
You have me.	Ggwe olina nze.
He could see immediately that it was wrong.	Yali asobola okulaba amangu ddala nti kyali kibi.
Whatever it really is.	Kyonna kye kiri ddala.
He wanted everything.	Yali ayagala buli kimu.
Or it may be the case.	Oba kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
And he is absolutely beautiful.	Era mulungi ddala.
He didn’t have time for this.	Kino yali talina budde.
It’s a thing, anyway.	Kintu, mu ngeri yonna.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
She would have to talk to him about it.	Yandibadde alina okwogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
No, this was a terrible thing.	Nedda, kino kyali kintu kibi nnyo.
He is very good to me.	Ali mulungi nnyo gyendi.
And he said he couldn’t agree more.	Era yagamba nti tayinza kukkiriza nnyo.
I know, in fact, that this is not the case.	Nkimanyi, mu butuufu, nti kino si bwe kiri.
He knew that was very important.	Yali akimanyi nti ekyo kikulu nnyo.
Not as strong as well.	Si nga kya maanyi nga bwe kiri.
Like, really really.	Nga, ddala ddala.
He suddenly felt overwhelmed.	Yawulira mangu nga alina ekizibu.
Nothing too complicated.	Tewali kintu kizibu nnyo.
I really needed one.	Nnali nneetaaga nnyo emu.
In the morning, he thought.	Ku makya, yalowooza nti.
But he does it anyway.	Naye akikola mu ngeri yonna.
Please, in this way.	Nsaba, mu ngeri eno.
And that he didn’t want to.	Era nti yali tayagala.
Everyone at school will know.	Buli muntu ku ssomero ajja kumanya.
I'm not exactly sure.	Sikakasa bulungi ddala.
I actually love my job.	Mu butuufu omulimu gwange njagala nnyo.
Driving my car.	Okuvuga mmotoka yange.
We can’t do this.	Kino tetusobola kukikola.
But not in this way.	Naye si mu ngeri eno.
This is a good practice.	Eno nkola nnungi.
I have high hopes.	Nnina essuubi ddene.
So far, so far.	Okutuuka kati.
Now the problem.	Kati ekizibu.
He was in his office.	Yali mu ofiisi ye.
Don’t go to school.	Togenda ku ssomero.
That had him, he thought.	Ekyo kyalina ye, bwe yalowooza.
But honestly, it’s great.	Naye mu butuufu, kirungi nnyo.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
No one knew anything or anyone.	Tewali yali amanyi kintu kyonna oba omuntu yenna.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
He was there all the time.	Yali awo buli kiseera.
But he didn’t know much.	Naye yali tamanyi nnyo.
You have to be yourself.	Olina okuba ggwe kennyini.
It won’t drive.	Tekijja kuvuga.
That’s not a good reason.	Eyo si nsonga nnungi.
He knew the guy had to eat.	Yali akimanyi nti ggaayi alina okulya.
He was going to make this work.	Yali agenda kukola kino okukola.
I don't know how to do this.	Simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukola kino.
It could be me, he said.	Kiyinza okuba nze, bwe yagambye.
Although he has a plan.	Wadde alina enteekateeka.
He thought he was too, he had to be.	Yalowooza nti naye yali, yalina okuba.
He knew he had something with her.	Yali akimanyi nti alina ky’alina naye.
You can’t do it right.	Tosobola kukikola bulungi.
It will always be there.	Bulijjo kijja kubaawo.
He loves those things.	Ayagala nnyo ebintu ebyo.
He won’t be coming.	Tajja kuba ajja.
She was a very feminine woman.	Yali mukyala nnyo.
I can’t say anything now.	Siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna kati.
What he had he didn’t want.	Kye yalina yali tayagala.
He doesn’t want to be good.	Tayagala kubeera mulungi.
There is only one or the other.	Waliwo omu yekka oba omulala.
She wanted, she wanted.	Yali ayagala, yali ayagala.
He wants to be with you.	Ayagala kubeera naawe.
He often does that.	Ekyo atera okukikola.
No one could see through.	Tewali yali asobola kulaba mu.
I hope you will help!.	Nsuubira nti ojja kuyamba!.
I’m in a hurry.	Nze ndi mu bwangu.
For me it’s good to move on.	Nze kirungi okugenda mu maaso.
That was just as much as he wanted.	Ekyo kyali nga bwe yali ayagala ennyo.
It’s awful, actually.	Kibi nnyo, mu butuufu.
I didn’t think it would happen.	Nnali sirowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
It was a dangerous job for us.	Yali mulimu gwa bulabe gye tuli.
Probably more than me.	Oboolyawo okusinga nze.
You already have a job.	Olina dda omulimu.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
Thinking was a must.	Okulowooza kyali kya kukola.
He lives there.	Abeera eyo.
Perhaps he really was sick, he thought.	Oboolyawo ddala yali mulwadde, bwe yalowooza.
He was my father .	Yali taata wange .
Just like it was yesterday.	Nga bwe kyali eggulo.
This was harder than he thought.	Kino kyali kizibu okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
But that’s not what he wants.	Naye ekyo si ky’ayagala.
But it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu, si kikulu.
That’s what he wanted to do.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala okukola.
Actually, it’s easy.	Mu butuufu, kyangu.
I am a human being like you.	Nze ndi muntu nga ggwe.
Not very helpful.	Si kya kuyamba nnyo.
It would be dangerous, but he could do it.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe, naye yali asobola okukikola.
They are mostly in good shape.	Okusinga bali mu mbeera nnungi.
Very hopeful.	Essuubi nnyo.
Beauty, to be beautiful.	Obulungi, okubeera omulungi.
Everyone has to move on.	Buli muntu alina okugenda mu maaso.
It’s very, very simple.	Kyangu nnyo nnyo.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
It’s there, and yet it’s not.	Kiri awo, era naye si bwe kiri.
But it’s true.	Naye kituufu.
But it was early.	Naye nga bukyali.
To be what he wanted to be.	Okubeera kye yali ayagala okuba.
In which, he didn't know.	Mu ki, yali tamanyi.
It's like now.	Kiri nga kati.
For that matter, you are nobody to me.	Ku nsonga eyo, toli muntu yenna gyendi.
No one is better.	Tewali muntu yenna asinga.
I feel lucky.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa.
You don't know where.	Tomanyi wa.
All of us in this room.	Ffenna mu kisenge kino.
I thought you were coming alone.	Nalowooza nti ojja wekka.
Now it is very important.	Kati kikulu nnyo.
Maybe he doesn’t think so.	Mpozzi nga talowooza bw’atyo.
But he looks dangerous to me.	Naye alabika nga wa bulabe gyendi.
I had no idea this could happen.	Nali sirina kirowoozo nti kino kiyinza okubaawo.
Maybe it was just that there was nothing to do.	Mpozzi kyali kituufu nga tewali kya kukola.
Anything you want.	Ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala.
I am definitely on the spot.	Mazima ddala ndi ku kifo.
He is fast, very fast.	Ye wa bwangu, wa bwangu nnyo.
He likes to be busy all the time.	Ayagala nnyo okubeera bbize buli kiseera.
He was a great singer.	Yali muyimbi nnyo.
That’s not a bad thing though.	Ekyo si kibi wadde.
This is why excellence is important to me.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki okukola obulungi kikulu gyendi.
You are a human being.	Oli muntu.
Whether you knew or not, that doesn’t matter.	Oba wali omanyi oba nedda, ekyo si kikulu.
I can’t go to the police.	Sisobola kugenda ku poliisi.
It really is a great school.	Mazima ddala ssomero ddene nnyo.
But he knew, he knew.	Naye yali amanyi, yali amanyi.
That’s what I want now.	Ekyo kati kye njagala.
I am moving forward.	Nze ndi mu kugenda mu maaso.
It’s a good attitude.	Endowooza nnungi.
They were old friends.	Baali ba mukwano gwa dda.
No one is around.	Tewali muntu yenna ali kumpi.
That’s going on.	Ekyo kigenda mu maaso.
He is the one we need.	Ye gwe twetaaga.
No, it is very dangerous.	Nedda, kya bulabe nnyo.
I think this is a great idea.	Ndowooza nti kino kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
Maybe that’s all.	Mpozzi ekyo kyokka.
And you won’t do it.	Era tojja kukikola.
We have to get there now.	Tulina okutuuka eyo kati.
Not to me you are not.	Si gyendi ggwe toli.
However, this is not luck.	Kyokka guno si mukisa.
I have my own opinion.	Nange ndowooza yange.
I’m in the process.	Nze ndi mu nkola.
Not even his person.	Wadde omuntu we.
You can move on.	Osobola okugenda mu maaso.
Living in the here and now.	Okubeera mu wano ne kati.
And he knew there was no answer to that.	Era yali akimanyi nti ekyo tewali kuddamu.
And no, it really doesn’t matter.	Era nedda, ddala si kikulu.
You won’t talk to me.	Tojja kwogera nange.
And he has been a great friend.	Era abadde mukwano gwange nnyo.
He expected to drive home.	Yali asuubira okuvuga mmotoka okudda eka.
But in the meantime .	Naye mu kiseera kino .
Really talking to him.	Ddala okwogera naye.
We all have to go.	Ffenna tulina okugenda.
He is really strong and well now.	Ali wa maanyi ddala era ali bulungi kati.
But that wasn’t it.	Naye ekyo si kye kyali.
No one does it the same.	Tewali akikola kye kimu.
I knew nothing about being a father.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku kubeera taata.
And he will do it.	Era ajja kukikola.
But he thought early until tomorrow.	Naye yalowooza nga bukyali okutuuka enkya.
You and I can talk.	Nze naawe tusobola okwogera.
She looked great for the whole situation.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo ku mbeera yonna.
Why not go with a plan right now.	Lwaki togenda na nteekateeka mu kiseera kino.
Not for any reason.	Si lwa nsonga yonna.
I feel pretty good too.	Nange mpulira bulungi nnyo.
He knew he shouldn’t.	Yali akimanyi nti tasaanidde kukola.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
This is always the key to the process.	Kino bulijjo kye kikulu mu nkola.
He loves his job.	Ayagala nnyo omulimu gwe.
That’s what’s going on.	Ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso.
And there is no time to do anything.	Era tewali budde bwa kukola kintu kyonna.
For a few moments, nothing seems to be happening.	Okumala akaseera katono, tewali kirabika nga kigenda mu maaso.
He started his career.	Yatandika omulimu gwe.
He was really something.	Ddala yali kintu.
No problem for them.	Tewali buzibu bwonna gye bali.
It’s the same as everywhere.	Kye kimu nga buli wamu.
You can, too.	Naawe oyinza.
You’re almost a doctor.	Kumpi oli musawo.
I can’t live with you.	Sisobola kubeera naawe.
I wish it wasn’t.	Njagala nga si bwe kiri.
And he is ready.	Era ye mwetegefu.
Obviously, this was a talking point.	Kya lwatu nti eno yali nsonga ya kwogera.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
But you won’t see anything.	Naye tojja kulaba kintu kyonna.
Speaking in response.	Okwogera mu kuddamu.
I was actually feeling pretty good.	Mu butuufu nnali mpulira bulungi nnyo.
I am not sure about myself.	Sikakasa ku nze kennyini.
He thought he had me.	Yalowooza nti alina nze.
He cannot do this here.	Kino tayinza kukikola wano.
I'll have to call.	Nja kuba nnina okukuba essimu.
He was in a hurry.	Yali mu bwangu.
I was working at the time too.	Nange nnali nkola mu kiseera ekyo.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
You are beautiful.	Oli mulungi.
He believed everything.	Yakkiriza buli kimu.
Nothing, nothing .	Tewali kintu kyonna, tewali kintu kyonna .
I hope you will agree.	Nsuubira nti ojja kukkiriza.
But it was probably all he was going to get.	Naye osanga kye kyokka kye yali agenda okufuna.
In the house.	Mu nnyumba.
You can go home now.	Osobola okudda eka kati.
He was just alone.	Yali yekka yekka.
To be so lucky and unlucky.	Okubeera nga wa mukisa nnyo era nga si wa mukisa.
Indeed, this was quite simple.	Mazima ddala, kino kyali kyangu nnyo.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
It was a great idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I think it’s pretty common.	Ndowooza nti kya bulijjo nnyo.
Almost anything you with plenty.	Kumpi ekintu kyonna ggwe nga olina bingi.
But it’s also not a good idea.	Naye era si kirowoozo kirungi.
But that’s not really the point.	Naye mu butuufu eyo si y’ensonga.
He is here this morning.	Ali wano enkya ya leero.
I don’t want to talk to you.	Saagala kwogera naawe.
And he loves it.	Era ayagala nnyo.
Not at that.	Nedda ku ekyo.
He hadn't had one in a while.	Yali amaze ebbanga nga talina emu.
You go downstairs.	Ogenda wansi.
I don’t want to be without you.	Saagala kubeera nga tolina ggwe.
That was the time it was.	Ekyo kye kiseera kye kyali.
I’ve got one for myself.	Nfunye emu ku nze.
Not really, but he might as well.	Si ddala, naye ayinza okuba nga naye.
And this is not the case here.	Era kino si bwe kiri wano.
He is my son.	Ye mwana wange.
And apparently you have to drive everywhere.	Era kirabika olina okuvuga buli wamu.
Not without you.	Si nga tolina ggwe.
I think it looks better this way.	Ndowooza kirabika bulungi mu ngeri eno.
I needed to be there help.	Nnali nneetaaga kubeerawo buyambi.
He was going anyway.	Yali agenda mu ngeri yonna.
I didn’t have it.	Nze nali sirina.
I have a job that I love.	Nnina omulimu gwe njagala.
But at the time.	Naye mu kiseera ekyo.
I don’t know whether to speak or not.	Simanyi oba okwogera oba nedda.
I think this is good.	Ndowooza kino kirungi.
What can anyone say.	Omuntu yenna ayinza kwogera ki.
He says he is busy.	Agamba nti ali bbize.
What's the problem.	Kiki ekizibu.
That’s not good for you or them.	Ekyo si kirungi gyoli oba gye bali.
In a way, it doesn’t really matter.	Mu ngeri emu, mu butuufu si kikulu.
Indeed, he thought he had.	Mazima ddala, yalowooza nti yalina.
It was a good car to drive.	Yali mmotoka nnungi okuvuga.
And there it was.	Era awo we kyali.
We'll talk to you, baby.	Tujja kwogera naawe mwana wange.
But he doesn’t go.	Naye tagenda.
It’s nothing of the sort.	Si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
If he could do that, he can do anything.	Singa yali asobola okukola ekyo, asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
A  .	Omu .
We’ll eat together.	Tujja kulya ffenna.
Really, really low.	Ddala, ddala wansi.
Here and now.	Wano ne kati.
I'm with you.	Nze nange.
He had a lot of money.	Yalina ssente nnyingi nnyo.
I wanted it in me.	Nnali njagala mu nze.
We are alone here.	Tuli ffekka wano.
He hoped it wasn’t.	Yalina essuubi nti si bwe kiri.
You are doing very well.	Okola bulungi nnyo.
I feel like I have this right now.	Mpulira nga nnina kino mu kiseera kino.
I am very sick myself.	Nze kennyini ndi mulwadde nnyo.
It goes on for a long time.	Kigenda mu maaso okumala ebbanga ddene.
But he also knew he needed this.	Naye era yali akimanyi nti kino yali yeetaaga.
I just know that it is.	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti bwe kiri.
And maybe he had.	Era mpozzi nga yalina.
Like that night.	Nga ekiro ekyo.
I am in trouble.	Ndi mu buzibu.
But it didn’t seem like it.	Naye yalabika nga si bwe kiri.
We cannot accept this fact.	Tetusobola kukkiriza nsonga eno.
But he is also my friend.	Naye era mukwano gwange.
I'm going to work.	Ngenda ku mulimu.
For almost everything.	Kumpi ku buli kimu.
This was good for me.	Kino kyali kirungi gyendi.
This problem is not uncommon.	Ekizibu kino si kya bulijjo.
I always wondered this.	Bulijjo kino nnali nneebuuza.
They were friendly.	Baali ba mukwano.
This looks good.	Kino kirabika kirungi.
He didn’t need it.	Yali teyeetaaga.
He certainly wasn’t.	Mazima ddala ye yali si bwe yali.
You will not be happy in this job.	Tojja kuba musanyufu mu mulimu guno.
It was a sin.	Kyali kibi.
And that was something he always knew, too.	Era ekyo kyali kintu kye yali amanyi bulijjo, naye.
However, we can do better.	Kyokka, tusobola okukola obulungi.
He spoke very low.	Yayogera wansi ddala.
One makes the other.	Omu akola omulala.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
The problem is, there is no system.	Obuzibu buli nti, tewali nkola.
He may have been in prison.	Ayinza okuba nga yali mu kkomera.
It’s not a bad thing to do.	Si kintu kibi okukola.
We don’t have to believe that.	Ekyo tetulina kukkiriza.
I'll be back soon.	Nja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
He certainly knew that.	Mazima ddala ekyo yali akimanyi.
Only at night.	Ekiro kyokka.
But he felt better.	Naye yawulira bulungi.
The plan is there.	Enteekateeka eri awo.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Only you will know what that is.	Ggwe wekka ajja okumanya ekyo kye kiri.
He spoke quickly.	Yayogera mangu.
Nothing is happening.	Tewali kigenda mu maaso.
Making things happen.	Okukola ebintu okubaawo.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
But in reality, that is not true.	Naye mu butuufu, ekyo si kituufu.
He has to be with me.	Alina okubeera nange.
But of course that is not the case.	Naye ddala ekyo si bwe kiri.
It’s nice to see.	Kirungi okulaba.
I have to go.	Nnina okugenda.
He had already said so much.	Yali yayogera dda bingi nnyo.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka kino si kituufu.
Now you are really afraid.	Kati ddala otya.
He can’t see a thing.	Tasobola kulaba kintu.
But he was alone.	Naye nga ali yekka.
That’s all, really.	Ekyo kyokka, ddala.
We were going to.	Twali tugenda.
But in this case it will not be true.	Naye mu mbeera eno tekijja kuba kituufu.
He goes to jail.	Agenda mu kkomera.
He is a man with a plan.	Ye musajja alina enteekateeka.
It will work.	Kijja kukola.
Always, about everything.	Bulijjo, ku buli kimu.
Not coming here.	Si kujja wano.
But he and I.	Naye naye nange.
It’s the time.	Kye kiseera.
Nothing will ever be exactly the same again.	Tewali kintu kyonna kijja kuddamu kuba kye kimu ddala.
There are also .	Waliwo ne .
And yet it continues.	Era naye kigenda mu maaso.
Maybe that will be enough.	Mpozzi ekyo kijja kumala.
I can’t do it.	Nze sisobola.
He is still the same.	Akyali kye kimu.
Everybody wants to make movies.	Buli muntu ayagala kukola firimu.
I needed his help.	Nnali nneetaaga obuyambi bwe.
But he could do that.	Naye ekyo yali asobola okukikola.
But this is not a good time.	Naye kino si kiseera kirungi.
He was a kid who didn’t want to be alone.	Yali mwana nga tayagala kubeera yekka.
It’s very important to them.	Kikulu nnyo gye bali.
This seems to be the case.	Kino kirabika nga bwe kiri.
The program was.	Enteekateeka eno yali...
I was so beautiful.	Nnali mulungi nnyo.
Everything was suddenly right.	Buli kimu kyali kituufu mu bwangu.
It may be true .	Kiyinza okuba nga kituufu .
It’s not a prison.	Si kkomera.
No thought there.	Tewali kirowoozo awo.
He knew all she was thinking.	Yali amanyi byonna bye yali alowooza.
He always told me everything.	Bulijjo yang’amba buli kimu.
It’s not for there.	Si kya eyo.
That’s all we need to know.	Ekyo kyokka kye twetaaga okumanya.
I’m afraid of everything.	Ntya buli kimu.
Not much harm.	Si bulabe bungi.
But it’s really easy.	Naye ddala kyangu.
I knew everybody.	Nnali mmanyi buli muntu.
But not for you.	Naye si lwa ggwe.
What do you think.	Ggwe olowooza ki.
Maybe it would be the same now.	Mpozzi nga kati kyandibadde ekintu kye kimu.
And there he was.	Era awo we yali.
But he was in all haste.	Naye yali mu bwangu bwonna.
From that you can form an opinion.	Okuva mu ekyo osobola okukola endowooza.
Here's where it's going to be.	Wano we kigenda okubeera.
Everyone looks great.	Buli muntu alabika bulungi nnyo.
He can be himself.	Asobola okuba ye kennyini.
That won’t stay the same.	Ekyo tekijja kusigala nga bwe kiri.
I wanted to back out of the room.	Nnali njagala okudda emabega okuva mu kisenge.
We have absolutely no idea.	Tetulina n’akatono kirowoozo kyonna.
And everything is going to be fine.	Era buli kimu kigenda kuba kirungi.
No, he couldn’t.	Nedda, yali tasobola.
Now he knew better.	Kati yali asinga okumanya.
And it’s a matter of absolute luck.	Era nsonga ya mukisa ddala.
I wanted to be here.	Nnali njagala kubeera wano.
It is very important	Kikulu nnyo .
I want so much more.	Njagala bingi nnyo.
Terrible.	Kibi.
Anyone can do it.	Omuntu yenna asobola okukikola.
I hope he is in a better place than this.	Nsuubira nti ali mu kifo kirungi okusinga kino.
Driving to work.	Okuvuga okugenda ku mulimu.
Another is in the hospital.	Omulala ali mu ddwaaliro.
I was completely completely normal.	Nali wa bulijjo ddala ddala.
He was doing well alone.	Yali akola bulungi yekka.
No, that’s not in him.	Nedda, ekyo si mu ye.
To you, to everyone.	Eri ggwe, eri buli muntu.
There is only you now.	Waliwo ggwe wekka kati.
Maybe it will be better in the morning.	Mpozzi kijja kuba kirungi ku makya.
We needed it.	Twali twetaaga.
Everyone will be interested.	Buli omu ajja kuba ayagala nnyo.
Now I couldn’t afford one.	Kati nnali sisobola kugula emu.
You can either do it or you can’t.	Osobola okukikola oba tosobola.
I’m good in any way.	Nze ndi mulungi mu ngeri yonna.
You are very, very beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo nnyo.
He really did it.	Ddala yakikola.
Everything was very easy to do.	Buli kimu kyali kyangu nnyo okukola.
More than usual.	Okusinga ku bulijjo.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
I don’t want to say too much.	Saagala kwogera bingi nnyo.
I could have won.	Nnali nsobola okuwangula.
I want to talk to you about it.	Njagala kwogera naawe ku nsonga eyo.
It’s easier to be free.	Kyangu okubeera nga tolina buzibu.
He could be absolutely anything.	Yali asobola okuba ekintu kyonna n’akatono.
However, this is simply not true.	Kyokka, kino si kituufu kyokka.
Seeing the same thing.	Okulaba ekintu kye kimu.
But he could not do this.	Naye kino yali tasobola kukikola.
I expected to know.	Nali nsuubira okumanya.
It would certainly be great.	Mazima ddala kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I’m the only one here.	Nze nzekka ali wano.
Beneath him, there was nothing.	Wansi we, nga tewali kintu kyonna.
It’s important to do it right.	Kikulu okukikola obulungi.
You didn’t know.	Ggwe wali tomanyi.
You are watching a movie.	Oli mu kulaba firimu.
I think he is better than that.	Ndowooza asinga ekyo.
that will do.	ekyo kijja kukola.
While this was going on.	Kino bwe kyali kigenda mu maaso.
That's my point.	Eyo y'ensonga yange.
He can’t be with you.	Tasobola kuba naawe.
There is no quick fix for it.	Tewali nkola ya mangu ku yo.
This is very difficult here.	Kino kizibu nnyo wano.
Or doing anything.	Oba okukola ekintu kyonna.
I was happy!.	Nali musanyufu!.
He has been very good to me.	Abadde mulungi nnyo gyendi.
To do the work.	Okukola omulimu.
Tonight he has his plans.	Ekiro kya leero alina enteekateeka ze.
I hope that will be enough.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kijja kumala.
I’ve got one.	Nfunye emu.
That's why they're here.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki bali wano.
I want anything and everything.	Njagala ekintu kyonna na buli kimu.
There is something in that.	Mu ekyo mulimu ekintu.
He may be a little.	Ayinza okuba nga katono.
And that’s right.	Era ekyo kituufu.
I want to stay in.	Njagala kusigala mu.
He certainly did.	Mazima ddala yakikola.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I feel the same way.	Nze mpulira kye kimu.
Very happy, actually.	Musanyufu nnyo, mu butuufu.
I thought he did a good job.	Nnalowooza nti yakola omulimu mulungi.
It was nobody.	Yali tewali muntu yenna.
Then it was one a week.	Awo kyali kimu mu wiiki.
I couldn’t believe it.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza.
It can happen every week.	Kiyinza okubaawo buli wiiki.
Like he knew he didn’t want to.	Nga bwe yali akimanyi nti tayagala.
I thought it was pretty easy to read.	Nalowooza nti kyangu nnyo okusoma.
To me this doesn’t matter.	Eri nze kino si kikulu.
Really, that’s not the point.	Ddala, eyo si y’ensonga.
He knew he couldn't last much longer.	Yali akimanyi nti tasobola kumala bbanga ddene nnyo.
He certainly was.	Mazima ddala yali.
That you were one.	Nti ggwe wali omu.
And you’re there.	Era oli awo.
And it’s really easy to do.	Era ddala kyangu okukola.
But what does that matter.	Naye ekyo kikulu ki.
He must be down.	Ateekwa okuba wansi.
But he would if he wanted to.	Naye yandikoze singa yali ayagala.
It will be good for me.	Kijja kuba kirungi gyendi.
But we are here together.	Naye tuli wano wamu.
It’s right now.	Kituufu kati.
No one did anything.	Tewali yakola kintu kyonna.
I don’t think so.	Sirowooza nti.
This is, of course, not true.	Kino, kya lwatu, si kituufu.
And at that time it was.	Era mu kiseera ekyo bwe kyali.
He says it’s nothing.	Agamba nti si kintu.
I always have something going on.	Bulijjo nnina ekintu ekigenda mu maaso.
Weeks, if he was lucky.	Wiiki, singa yalina omukisa.
But here’s where it goes.	Naye wano we kigenda.
Certainly not much at all.	Mazima ddala si bingi nnyo n’akatono.
You have him.	Ggwe olina ye.
It always comes.	Bulijjo kijja.
I have little hope.	Nnina essuubi ttono.
This is my practice as well as his.	Kino kye nkola yange nga bwe kiri kye.
I wanted to do that for a very long time.	Ekyo nnali njagala okukikola okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
You probably won’t buy a house.	Oboolyawo tojja kugula nnyumba.
And that was obvious.	Era ekyo kyali kya lwatu.
But it doesn’t really matter.	Naye mu butuufu si kikulu.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Kyokka kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
But he knows it.	Naye akimanyi.
In this process.	Mu nkola eno.
So there he was.	Bwatyo awo we yali.
Not from us.	Si okuva gye tuli.
I'm not sure where the problem is right now.	Sikakasa buzibu gye buli mu kiseera kino.
He would be there soon.	Yandibadde awo mu bbanga ttono.
Terrible.	Kibi.
Getting the facts.	Okufuna ensonga.
It’s easy to talk to him.	Kyangu okwogera naye.
Here he was reluctant.	Wano yali tayagala.
It’s a wonderful time.	Kiseera kirungi nnyo.
We need help with everything.	Twetaaga obuyambi mu buli kimu.
This is probably a problem.	Kino osanga kizibu.
She is young and very attractive.	Muto era alabika bulungi nnyo.
This is a dangerous issue.	Eno nsonga ya bulabe.
Actually, no, no it’s not.	Mu butuufu, nedda, nedda si bwe kiri.
I'm not sure how.	Sikakasa ngeri ki.
We all need to move forward.	Ffenna twetaaga okugenda mu maaso.
This is a really good thing.	Kino kintu kirungi ddala.
And not everything is what it seems.	Era si buli kimu nti kye kirabika.
Surely hungry hungry.	Mazima enjala enjala.
It’s actually much worse than that.	Mu butuufu kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
It was in a strong way.	Yali mu ngeri ya maanyi.
Daddy has to go.	Taata alina okugenda.
He did well.	Yakola bulungi.
Probably right.	Oboolyawo nga kituufu.
They are fine with him.	Bali bulungi naye.
You were always young.	Bulijjo wali muto.
I’m sick of it.	Nze ndi mulwadde.
I know that’s true.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo kituufu.
He will return this afternoon.	Agenda kudda akawungeezi ka leero.
I can’t talk to just anyone.	Sisobola kwogera na muntu yenna yekka.
Although he could also buy in advance.	Wadde nga naye yali asobola okugula nga bukyali.
And it is true that he is actually a child.	Era kituufu nti mu butuufu ye mwana.
That was a good thing.	Ekyo kyali kirungi.
Everyone has it.	Buli muntu alina.
Now it’s going down.	Kati kigenda wansi.
I feel like it’s the same.	Mpulira nga kye kimu.
The book he was expecting.	Ekitabo kye yali asuubira.
However, this is not the case here.	Kyokka wano si bwe kiri.
It’s too bad for you.	Kibi nnyo gyoli.
That view was unrealistic.	Endowooza eyo yali si ya ddala.
Perhaps it had.	Oboolyawo kyalina.
He was in a lot of trouble.	Yali mu buzibu bungi nnyo.
I hope it is very accurate.	Nsuubira nti kituufu nnyo.
I'll have to go.	Nja kuba nnina okugenda.
Like you there.	Nga naawe awo.
And there was so much more.	Era nga waliwo bingi nnyo.
We’ll see what it can do.	Tujja kulaba kye kiyinza okukola.
I think we’ll go home now.	Ndowooza tujja kudda eka kati.
But he's coming.	Naye ajja.
And maybe to you.	Era mpozzi eri ggwe.
And if anyone else has a problem with that .	Era singa waliwo omuntu omulala yenna alina obuzibu ku ekyo .
He's been at this for a long time.	Abadde ku kino okumala ebbanga ddene.
But that wasn’t really the case.	Naye mu butuufu ekyo si bwe kyali.
Everyone wants to actually be with you.	Buli muntu ayagala kubeera naawe mu butuufu.
This will not be true.	Kino tekijja kuba kituufu.
But there he was.	Naye awo gye yali.
He didn't even know why he was here.	Yali tamanyi na lwaki yali wano.
You have the power.	Ggwe olina amaanyi.
He always has to say this.	Bulijjo alina okwogera bino.
You’re in luck.	Oli mu mukisa.
The other wasn’t.	Omulala si bwe kyali.
It’s really quick.	Kya mangu ddala.
That was his problem.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu kye.
Of course, this could be any book.	Kya lwatu nti kino kiyinza okuba ekitabo kyonna.
In theory, this is easy to do.	Mu ndowooza, kino kyangu okukola.
I can do it if you don’t have time.	Nsobola okukikola singa tolina budde.
There are three reasons.	Waliwo ensonga ssatu.
That’s not everybody.	Ekyo si buli muntu.
Who else could it be.	Ani omulala ayinza okuba.
But there is reason for hope.	Naye waliwo ensonga lwaki tulina essuubi.
I’m hungry too.	Nze nange enjala enjala.
This is a very complex and dangerous process.	Eno nkola ya buzibu nnyo era ya bulabe.
He still couldn’t quite believe it.	Yali n’okutuusa kati yali tasobola bulungi kukkiriza.
I’ve only got one guy.	Nze nfunye ggaayi omu yekka.
It’s not necessarily a bad thing.	Si kituufu nti kintu kibi.
Not a party to this.	Si kibiina kya kino.
There’s really no problem with the subject matter.	Mu butuufu tewali kizibu kyonna ku nsonga.
There is beauty in everyone.	Mu buli muntu mulimu obulungi.
He is still here.	Akyali wano.
I can't see.	Sisobola kulaba.
But you do now.	Naye ggwe okola kati.
But it is very important.	Naye kikulu nnyo.
I'm not sure why that would be.	Sikakasa lwaki ekyo kyandibadde.
The picture was important.	Ekifaananyi kyali kikulu.
I'm glad he's here.	Ndi musanyufu nti ali wano.
And then he isn’t.	Era awo si bw’atyo.
I am not sure how to go about it.	Sikakasa ngeri ki gye nnyinza okukikola.
Now we have to talk.	Kati tulina okwogera.
He hoped he would.	Yalina essuubi nti yandibadde akikola.
It’s not easy to find.	Si kyangu kufuna.
And he doesn’t have it either.	Era naye talina.
I was afraid of the same thing.	Nali ntya ekintu kye kimu.
It was just a matter of time.	Kyali kiseera kyokka.
He was one himself.	Ye kennyini yali omu.
I need an opinion here.	Nze nneetaaga endowooza wano.
But you’re going to be fine.	Naye ogenda kuba bulungi.
It was just awful.	Kyali kibi nnyo kyokka.
You're with me.	Oli nange.
You’ve had all night.	Obadde olina ekiro kyonna.
This arrangement	Enteekateeka eno .
But he really hadn’t.	Naye ddala yali talina.
He says we will win.	Agamba nti tujja kuwangula.
I don’t have any agenda.	Sirina agenda yonna.
Good as well, they were.	Kirungi nga bwe kiri, baali.
I had nothing to say.	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera.
That had to be the case.	Ekyo kyalina okuba nga bwe kiri.
Not now, maybe not again.	Si kati, mpozzi si kuddamu.
We will do it for you.	Tujja kukikola ku ggwe.
You are in a very good position.	Oli mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
Just like he did with me.	Nga bwe yakola nange.
However, he obviously wasn’t.	Kyokka, kya lwatu nti si bwe yali.
This may or may not be the case.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri oba nedda.
The arrangement was excellent.	Enteekateeka yali nnungi nnyo.
She is a beautiful woman, yes.	Mukyala mulungi, ye.
He speaks in that way.	Ayogera mu ngeri eyo.
No one is real.	Tewali muntu yenna wa ddala.
We are on his side.	Tuli ku ludda lwe.
A lot below, actually.	Bingi wansi, mu butuufu.
Now the beautiful one.	Kati omulungi.
For one night.	Okumala ekiro kimu.
And it’s not just about him.	Era si ku ye yekka.
He was the very best.	Ye yali asinga obulungi ennyo.
And we are in that time.	Era tuli mu kiseera ekyo.
This is actually good.	Kino mu butuufu kirungi.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
No one will go he not.	Tewali ajja kugenda ye si.
And what .	Era kiki .
This is probably why you can’t get anything now.	Oboolyawo eno y’ensonga lwaki kati tosobola kufuna kintu kyonna.
But we are lucky.	Naye ffe tuli ba mukisa.
He obviously couldn’t.	Kya lwatu nti yali tasobola.
This indeed may be the case.	Kino ddala kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
He knew he was good.	Yali akimanyi nti mulungi.
You want something from me.	Oyagala ekintu okuva gyendi.
You can definitely swim.	Osobola ddala okuwuga.
Me too, despite everything.	Nange, wadde nga buli kimu kiri.
I'm thinking of you!.	Nze ndowooza ku ggwe!.
I have to get out of here.	Nnina okuva wano.
He was to go on alone.	Yali wa kugenda mu maaso yekka.
No one knew where this place was.	Tewali yali amanyi kifo kino gye kyali.
No one but me.	Tewali muntu yenna okuggyako nze.
Always has and always will be.	Bulijjo alina era bulijjo ajja kuba.
He was that good to us.	Yali mulungi bw’atyo gye tuli.
I could hardly wait.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kulinda.
He does this for everyone.	Kino akikola ku buli muntu.
That’s what it really looked like.	Ekyo kye kyali kirabika ddala.
I'll help.	Nja kuyamba.
He is really very happy.	Ddala musanyufu nnyo.
He was obviously happy.	Kirabika yali musanyufu.
It’s hard to say that now.	Kizibu okwogera ekyo kati.
I could have done it.	Nnali nsobola okukikola.
It goes on for, like, an hour.	Kigenda mu maaso okumala, nga, essaawa emu.
He doesn’t need to say anything.	Teyeetaaga kwogera kintu kyonna.
It wasn’t that he didn’t have a point.	Si nti yali talina nsonga.
In every way he excels.	Mu buli ngeri asinga.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nali simanyi kiki.
In fact, no one expected it to happen.	Mu butuufu, tewali yali asuubira nti kijja kubaawo.
That’s all he needs to know.	Ekyo kyokka ky’alina okumanya.
I haven’t been able to figure out why.	Mbadde sisobola kumanya lwaki.
Really, you should go now.	Ddala, wandibadde ogenda kati.
We always have, and we always will.	Bulijjo tulina, era bulijjo tujja kukikola.
He didn’t need to do that.	Yali teyeetaaga kukola ekyo.
And they are not.	Era si bwe bali.
That’s a terrible thing.	Ekyo kibi nnyo.
I’m sure this is very difficult.	Nkakasa nti kino kizibu nnyo.
He thinks, and he is human.	Alowooza, era muntu.
There seems to be nothing wrong.	Kirabika tewali kibi kyonna.
We’re at a party.	Tuli ku kabaga.
It was for us.	Kyali eri ffe.
But this is not what matters to me.	Naye kino si kye kikulu gyendi.
Which he always wanted.	Kye yali ayagala bulijjo.
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
I think this is very true.	Ndowooza kino kituufu nnyo.
And he knew it too.	Era naye yali akimanyi.
It is not that .	Si bwe kiri nti .
This is a very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
He told me that.	Yang’amba bw’atyo.
It’s not just an idea.	Si kirowoozo kyokka.
Someone has to be.	Omuntu alina okuba.
It is a way	Kye ngeri .
He was the brother of that friend.	Yali muganda wa mukwano gwe oyo.
I know this for a reason.	Kino nkimanyi lwa nsonga.
And that’s the same for me.	Era ekyo kye kimu ne ku nze.
He must be what he is.	Ateekwa okuba nga ky’ali.
Here it was dangerous.	Wano kyali kya bulabe.
It’s going to be a player.	Kigenda kuba muzannyi.
I love dinner and movies.	Njagala nnyo ekyeggulo ne firimu.
He had it.	Yali alina.
But not as a romantic thing.	Naye si nga ekintu kya mukwano.
I have so much to do.	Nze nnina bingi nnyo bye nnina okukola.
How gorgeous, as always.	Nga alabika bulungi nnyo, nga bulijjo.
Maybe he was the father.	Mpozzi ye yali taata.
Maybe that's why that picture is so beautiful.	Mpozzi y'ensonga lwaki ekifaananyi ekyo kirungi nnyo.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
Not even himself.	Si wadde ye kennyini.
And yes, it's great to have you back with you too.	Era ye, kirungi nnyo okuddamu okubeera naawe naawe.
That you can get too.	Nti naawe osobola okufuna.
Which I do, though.	Kye nkola, wadde.
I am a lucky one.	Nze ndi mukisa.
This was a very serious matter.	Eno yali nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
I want to go home.	Njagala kudda waka.
Maybe it was something in the sky.	Mpozzi nga kyali kintu mu bbanga.
Not bad for a little while.	Si kibi okumala akaseera katono.
He doesn’t have a problem.	Talina buzibu.
I feel like I’m ready.	Mpulira nga ndi mwetegefu.
I don’t really know.	Mu butuufu simanyi.
I wanted to be something too.	Nange nnali njagala okubeera ekintu.
He didn't know what he was afraid of.	Yali tamanyi kye yali atya.
He was exactly like me in every way.	Yali nga nze ddala mu buli ngeri.
It seems to have been the norm at the time.	Kirabika yali nkola ya mu kiseera ekyo.
So far so good,.	N'okutuusa kati kirungi nnyo,.
I thought it would work.	Nalowooza nti kijja kukola.
He didn’t even want to talk to her.	Yali tayagala na kwogera naye.
He had him.	Yalina ye.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Naye nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eyo.
I really want to do this on my watch too.	Nze ddala njagala okukola kino ku ssaawa yange nange.
I think it’s great.	Ndowooza nti kirungi nnyo.
I'm pretty sure that's all.	Nkakasa bulungi nti ekyo kyokka.
It’s really, really awful.	Ddala ddala kibi nnyo.
The phone went off.	Essimu yagenda.
I’m going to be fine.	Ngenda kuba bulungi.
No one is alone.	Tewali ali yekka.
I'm so glad you don't.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti tolina.
It certainly wouldn’t be me.	Mazima ddala si kyandibadde nze.
I’m not entirely sure.	Sikakasa ddala.
I am a good man.	Ndi musajja mulungi.
Perhaps this is true.	Oboolyawo kino kituufu.
I am, of course.	Nze, ddala.
You know he couldn’t.	Omanyi nti yali tasobola.
Of course, help is not immediate.	Kya lwatu nti obuyambi si bwa bwangu.
I was so nervous that I thought this would be it.	Nali ntya nnyo ne ndowooza nti kino kye kyandibadde.
He had his reasons.	Yalina ensonga ze.
You knew that, always knew.	Ekyo wali okimanyi, bulijjo okimanyi.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
And he has it.	Era alina.
I was one myself.	Nze kennyini nnali omu.
But you don’t want to do that.	Naye ekyo toyagala kukikola.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
No one will know except us.	Tewali ajja kumanya okuggyako ffe.
He's going to be fine.	Agenda kuba bulungi.
It’s actually a beautiful thing.	Mu butuufu kintu kirungi nnyo.
He knew this.	Kino yali akimanyi.
It was definitely a great experience for us.	Mazima ddala kyali kirungi nnyo gye tuli.
I wish that .	Njagala nti .
And my father .	Ne taata wange .
He could, but he wasn’t going to.	Yali asobola, naye yali tagenda.
That is a very, very powerful thing.	Ekyo kintu kya maanyi nnyo nnyo.
In fact, it was bad.	Mu butuufu, kyali kibi.
He was a very nice person.	Yali muntu mulungi nnyo.
However, this is the problem.	Kyokka kino kye kizibu.
And he must know what they were.	Era alina okumanya kye baali.
But you’re ready.	Naye oli mwetegefu.
A very difficult night.	Ekiro ekizibu ennyo.
There is a way, of course.	Waliwo engeri, ddala.
However, that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Kyokka, ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri.
It was really beautiful.	Ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
He didn't seem to know what to say.	Yalabika nga tamanyi kya kwogera.
But not consciously.	Naye si mu kumanya.
He was very young	Yali muto nnyo .
But of course he would.	Naye ddala yandikoze.
He won’t be able to find a job.	Tajja kusobola kufuna mulimu.
He must be asleep.	Ateekwa okuba nga yeebase.
He didn’t want you .	Yali tayagala ggwe .
However, I am not alone.	Kyokka, si nze nzekka.
And he knows a lot.	Era amanyi nnyo.
But we can’t.	Naye tetusobola.
And that’s what he wants for all of us.	Era ekyo ky’ayagala eri ffenna.
Not to anything, nor from anything.	Si eri ekintu kyonna, wadde okuva ku kintu kyonna.
He should know better, he really should.	Alina okumanya obulungi, ddala yandibadde amanyi.
We are still, one on one.	Tuli ne kati, omu ku omu.
There isn’t any movie.	Tewali firimu yonna.
But not for everyone.	Naye si eri buli muntu.
I have a book like that.	Nange nnina ekitabo ng’ekyo.
That’s what we needed.	Ekyo kye twali twetaaga.
And not in a good way.	Era si mu ngeri nnungi.
Dad, but not my dad.	Taata, naye si taata wange.
There is no one there.	Tewali muntu yenna awo.
So far, nothing.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali kintu kyonna.
And, we are prompt and on time.	Era, tuli ba mangu era mu budde.
Your plan is unrealistic.	Enteekateeka yo si ya mazima.
I feel so alone.	Mpulira nga ndi nzekka nnyo.
I might have a friend coming too.	Nange nnyinza okuba ne mukwano gwange ajja.
You’re coming with me.	Ggwe ojja nange.
You’re not there.	Ggwe toli awo.
He could not .	Yali tasobola .
It’s up to me.	Kiri gyendi.
I think he was sick.	Ndowooza yali mulwadde.
He had to go.	Yalina okugenda.
And it was pretty cool.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo.
This was a very important step.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
This is the whole thing.	Kino kye kintu kyonna.
And, it continues.	Era, kigenda mu maaso.
He knew it wasn’t real.	Yali akimanyi nti si kya ddala.
And they are.	Era bwe bali.
Everything was happening the way it should have happened.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda mu maaso mu ngeri gye kyandibadde kigenda mu maaso.
You won’t work.	Tojja kukola.
That was all the guy needed.	Ekyo kyokka ggaayi kye yali yeetaaga.
I want to the movies.	Njagala ku firimu.
Good, good, very good.	Kirungi, kirungi, kirungi nnyo.
He didn’t want to be this way.	Yali tayagala kubeera mu ngeri eno.
This is hard to answer.	Kino kizibu okuddamu.
He saw things.	Yalaba ebintu.
He doesn’t know.	Tamanyi.
And in here.	Era mu wano.
But that wasn’t my point.	Naye eyo si ye yali ensonga yange.
This is a time of great danger for all of us.	Kino kiseera kya bulabe bwa maanyi eri ffenna.
You have no idea how lucky you are!.	Tolina kirowoozo ku ngeri gy'oli wa mukisa!.
However, it can happen to anyone.	Kyokka, kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna.
Really, that’s easy.	Ddala, ekyo kyangu.
But that was something he didn't want.	Naye ekyo kyali kintu kye yali tayagala.
And today we’re going again.	Era leero tugenda kuddamu.
It almost doesn’t matter.	Kumpi si kikulu.
Certainly there is.	Mazima ddala waliwo.
We are the only ones.	Ffe tuli kyokka.
This was really happening.	Kino ddala kyali kigenda mu maaso.
I’m going to keep going.	Ngenda kusigala nga ngenda mu maaso.
He wanted to move on.	Yali ayagala kugenda mu maaso.
We are all	Ffenna tuli .
He is that good.	Ye mulungi bw’atyo.
And that is what .	Era ekyo kye .
I'll be fine.	Nja kuba bulungi.
It could be anyone.	Kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
We should be very safe.	Tusaanidde okuba nga tetulina bulabe nnyo.
Not on him.	Si ku ye.
It was a beautiful night.	Ekiro kyali kirungi nnyo.
Probably my watch.	Oboolyawo essaawa yange.
It was a serious issue.	Yali nsonga ya maanyi.
But he	Naye ye .
Every child is a singer.	Buli mwana muyimbi.
It’s really pretty cool.	Ddala kirungi nnyo.
But his brother is a child.	Naye muganda we mwana muto.
But there are many reasons.	Naye waliwo ensonga nnyingi.
He knew everyone in the office.	Yali amanyi buli muntu mu ofiisi.
He is very real to me.	Ye wa ddala nnyo gyendi.
He thought he would.	Yalowooza nti ajja kukikola.
To me, it’s as simple as that.	Eri nze, kyangu nga ekyo.
He doesn’t seem to need to say anything.	Alabika talina kye yeetaaga kwogera.
I don’t even have to be here.	Nze sirina wadde okubeera wano.
Not bad, not bad at all.	Si kibi, si kibi n’akatono.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Yali asobola okukola kyonna kye yali ayagala.
Apparently no one is very nice.	Kirabika tewali muntu mulungi nnyo.
We were real.	Twali ba ddala.
I couldn’t do that now.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola kati.
I’m glad you’re happy.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli musanyufu.
Now it’s time to strike.	Kati kye kiseera okukuba.
The movie was really good.	Firimu yali nnungi ddala.
It's money, money, money.	Ye ssente, ssente, ssente.
In this way or that.	Mu ngeri eno oba eyo.
We can see it coming.	Tusobola okulaba nga kijja.
And he has knowledge.	Era alina okumanya.
And he didn’t want to answer.	Era yali tayagala kuddamu.
Today is the	Leero lwe .
It was almost on him.	Kumpi kyali ku ye.
It goes something like this.	Kigenda ekintu nga kino.
You have to know.	Olina okumanya.
It would be difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu.
That's who you were to be.	Oyo gwe wali okuba.
He has always been working.	Bulijjo abadde akola.
And the	Era ne .
It’s too bad for you.	Kibi nnyo gy’oli.
I was always ready.	Bulijjo nnali mwetegefu.
Obviously I don’t want to do this.	Kya lwatu kino saagala kukikola.
At the office all morning.	Ku ofiisi enkya yonna.
He said it wasn’t.	Yagambye nti si bwe kiri.
. . . .	.
I was the beautiful one.	Nze nnali mulungi.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
But we could do it.	Naye twali tusobola okukikola.
We don’t have time for that.	Ekyo tetulina budde.
He had a reason for being handsome.	Yalina ensonga lwaki alabika bulungi.
But there is no answer.	Naye tewali kuddamu.
He knew where my father was.	Yali amanyi taata gye yali.
I’m glad you’re here.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano.
He won’t play with me.	Tajja kuzannya nange.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
It will be quick and easy.	Kijja kuba kyangu era kyangu.
He couldn’t eat much of anything.	Yali tasobola kulya kintu kyonna nnyo.
The whole thing was hard work.	Ekintu kyonna kyali kya kukola nnyo.
That would be right.	Ekyo kyandibadde kituufu.
He said it was mine.	Yagambye nti kyange.
But he was harmless.	Naye yali talina bulabe.
We have a house but we are not the house.	Tulina ennyumba naye si ffe ennyumba.
And he couldn’t maybe.	Era yali tasobola mpozzi.
Nothing there, either.	Tewali kintu kyonna awo, era.
I'm hungry and hungry.	Nange enjala enjala.
You can do it too.	Naawe osobola okukikola.
If it goes down.	Singa kigenda wansi.
It was time to speak now.	Kyali kiseera okwogera kati.
And there is my point.	Era waliwo ensonga yange.
I need to know where they are.	Nze nneetaaga okumanya gye bali.
I can’t tell which one.	Sisobola kumanya ki.
Now he just has to wait.	Kati alina kulinda kyokka.
I’m not ready for a party.	Nze siri mwetegefu ku kabaga.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
And why now.	Era lwaki kati.
He needs to do better.	Yeetaaga okukola obulungi.
Here is my book.	Wano waliwo ekitabo kyange.
And he doesn’t have it.	Era talina.
Why might that be?.	Lwaki ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri?.
We have to do it now.	Tulina okukikola kati.
And not just me, everyone.	Era si nze nzekka, buli muntu.
Speaking is difficult.	Okwogera kizibu.
There is only this.	Waliwo kino kyokka.
There is no one behind him.	Tewali muntu yenna emabega we.
It was all he could think to do.	Kye kyokka kye yali asobola okulowooza okukola.
There is absolutely nothing wrong.	Tewali kibi n’akatono.
He is not sick.	Si mulwadde.
That's the only one.	Oyo yekka.
Very nice to see.	Kirungi nnyo okulaba.
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kirungi.
He is a regular player.	Ye muzannyi wa bulijjo.
I can’t wait to make these again.	Siyinza kulinda kuddamu kukola bino.
Even in the city there is beauty.	Ne mu kibuga waliwo obulungi.
And you know you’re not human.	Era okimanyi nti toli muntu.
He knew that, now, here in his room.	Ekyo yali akimanyi, kati, wano mu kisenge kye.
That’s very important to me.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo gyendi.
But he isn’t.	Naye ye si bwe kiri.
I'm pretty sure this is it.	Nkakasa bulungi nti kino kye kiri.
I want to know.	Njagala okumanya.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
He always has.	Bulijjo alina.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
It was a beautiful place there.	Kyali kifo kirungi nnyo eyo.
No one needed to answer.	Tewali yali yeetaaga kuddamu.
How could he live with himself?.	Yali asobola atya okubeera naye kennyini?.
A little more than usual.	Katono okusinga ku bulijjo.
He was going in the shower.	Yali agenda mu ssaawa.
You're the best!.	Ggwe asinga!.
And we are winning.	Era tuli kuwangula.
You might as well .	Oyinza okuba nga naawe .
The night is coming.	Ekiro kijja.
I don’t want to be his friend.	Saagala kubeera mukwano gwe.
What a terrible idea.	Nga kirowoozo kibi nnyo.
But no one did anything like that.	Naye tewali yakola kintu kyonna ng’ekyo.
Now it was almost empty.	Kati yali kumpi nga tewali muntu yenna.
I will do this.	Kino nja kukikola.
Until last weekend.	Okutuuka ku wiikendi ewedde.
It was dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe.
That's not the case at all.	Ekyo si bwe kiri n'akatono.
This was a bad thing.	Kino kyali kibi.
This is all I want.	Kino kyokka kye njagala.
To see, of course.	Okulaba, ddala.
You knew you couldn’t.	Obadde okimanyi nti tosobola.
He can read anyone.	Asobola okusoma omuntu yenna.
It’s not normal for me.	Si kya bulijjo gyendi.
It’s not an idea.	Si kirowoozo.
I've been thinking.	Mbadde ndowooza.
I don’t have a good one.	Nze sirina mulungi.
He was very lucky in that regard.	Yali wa mukisa nnyo mu nsonga eyo.
I want to be alone.	Njagala kubeera nzekka.
It’s just .	Kye kyokka .
It’s probably what’s going to happen.	Oboolyawo kye kigenda okubaawo.
We are not moving forward.	Tetulina kye tugenda mu maaso.
This was the problem.	Kino kye kyali ekizibu.
This is very powerful.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo.
It can go either way, really.	Kiyinza okugenda mu ngeri yonna, ddala.
Not too early.	Si nga bukyali nnyo.
I didn’t have time for that.	Ekyo nnali sirina budde.
He didn’t think he wanted to go home.	Yali talowooza nti ayagala kudda waka.
But there is reason for optimism.	Naye waliwo ensonga lwaki omuntu alina essuubi.
. . . .	.
She had to talk to him.	Yalina okwogera naye.
Not talking too much.	Si kwogera nnyo.
Ready when you are.	Mwetegefu nga oli.
That's you and me.	Oyo nze naawe.
But not today’s date.	Naye si lunaku lwa leero.
No one could have done that.	Ekyo tewali yandibadde asobola kukikola.
Happy to do the work.	Musanyufu okukola omulimu.
I do like him.	Nze nkola nga ye.
But he could think about it.	Naye yali asobola okulowooza ku nsonga eyo.
But this was wrong.	Naye kino kyali kibi.
I don't know how to reason.	Simanyi ngeri ya nsonga.
Or, you don’t have to.	Oba, tolina kukikola.
And to them it was.	Era gye bali bwe kyali.
It would be very dangerous.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe nnyo.
You can get out of that situation.	Osobola okuva mu mbeera eyo.
Not the way they were together.	Si ngeri gye baali bombi.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
This is not easy at all.	Kino si kyangu n’akatono.
Just dinner.	Ekyeggulo kyokka.
It 's really	Ddala ye .
However, that is not all.	Kyokka, ekyo si kye kyokka.
He says he does it.	Agamba nti akikola.
How fast he was.	Nga yali wa bwangu.
He must have been expecting my call.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali asuubira essimu yange.
You go in a hurry.	Ogenda mu bwangu.
Which he himself could not believe.	Ye kennyini kye yali tasobola kukkiriza.
However, not everyone agreed.	Kyokka, si buli omu nti yakkiriza.
I can’t play the guy.	Sisobola kuzannya ggaayi.
This is very dangerous.	Kino kya bulabe nnyo.
In fact, it was.	Mu butuufu, bwe kyali.
This is dangerous.	Kino kya bulabe.
We have to do this.	Kino tulina okukikola.
You never know when they’re good.	Tomanyi ddi lwe bali bulungi.
That was good for them.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gye bali.
You are my wife now.	Oli mukyala wange kati.
I'm not good at all.	Nze siri mulungi n'akatono.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
He will just will do it.	Ajja kumala ajja kukikola.
That is .	Ekyo kiri nti .
You can talk.	Osobola okwogera.
Where he could be himself .	We yali asobola okubeera ye kennyini .
We are in a dangerous situation here.	Tuli mu mbeera ya bulabe wano.
But that’s not quite right.	Naye ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
And now he was moving on.	Era kati yali agenda mu maaso.
Beautiful, very beautiful.	Mulungi, mulungi nnyo.
You really have no room to speak.	Mazima ddala tolina kifo kya kwogera.
He seemed to deal with everything.	Yalabika ng’akola ku buli kimu.
He was obviously hopeful.	Kya lwatu nti yali alina essuubi.
Tonight we are there.	Ekiro kya leero tuli awo.
He had been vulnerable as well.	Yali abadde mu bulabe naye.
However, it won’t be too bad.	Kyokka, tekijja kuba kibi nnyo.
But that is not the case today.	Naye si bwe kiri leero.
You’re here for him.	Oli wano lwa ye.
But here’s where it goes.	Naye wano we kigenda.
I think it would be a great idea.	Ndowooza kyandibadde kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
This was excellent.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
It could be anyone.	Kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
That was, until now.	Ekyo kyali, okutuusa kati.
Now everyone asked.	Kati buli omu yabuuza.
You know better than that.	Omanyi okusinga ekyo.
This is the clock.	Eno ssaawa.
And he won’t do it.	Era tajja kukikola.
I don’t like it at all.	Sikyagala n’akatono.
No, you are not alone.	Nedda, toli wekka.
I won’t do anything.	Sijja kukola kintu kyonna.
When no one was.	Nga tewali muntu yenna yali.
I didn’t like it at all.	Nnali sikyagala n’akatono.
You actually have to do it.	Mu butuufu olina okukikola.
I had no idea of ​​this.	Kino nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
He couldn’t help it.	Yali tasobola kuyamba.
I’m a young child.	Nze ndi mwana muto.
That thing was my fault.	Ekyo ekintu kyali kibi kyange.
But here he comes to you.	Naye wano ajja gy’oli.
We will do this together.	Kino tujja kukikola wamu.
That’s not what’s at issue.	Ekyo si kye kiri mu nsonga.
It's important to you.	Kikulu gy'oli.
Not the person in front.	Si muntu mu maaso.
But today it’s easy.	Naye leero kyangu.
For a guy, it’s not good.	Ku ggaayi, si kirungi.
Actually, that’s a good thing.	Mu butuufu, ekyo kintu kirungi.
He will do that.	Ekyo ajja kukikola.
I hope it continues.	Nsuubira nti kigenda mu maaso.
At this point, you really can’t go home.	Mu kiseera kino, ddala tosobola kudda waka.
Not that it mattered.	Si nti kyali kikulu.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
. . . .	.
I think that was a good idea.	Ndowooza ekyo kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
Perhaps you can help.	Oboolyawo oyinza okuyamba.
No, nothing serious.	Nedda, tewali kintu kya maanyi.
I can’t drive.	Sisobola kuvuga.
It’s hard on someone.	Kizibu ku muntu.
Everyone had to arrive at the same time.	Buli muntu yalina okutuuka mu kiseera kye kimu.
Maybe he knows it.	Mpozzi akimanyi.
It is not the case here.	Si bwe kiri wano.
That’s a difficult thing to do.	Ekyo kintu ekizibu okukola.
I love this job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu guno.
And yet it isn’t.	Era naye si bwe kiri.
Not consciously, at the time.	Si mu kumanya, mu kiseera ekyo.
Not in there .	Si mu eyo .
Maybe he'll be fine.	Mpozzi ajja kuba bulungi.
Or with anyone else.	Oba nga waliwo omuntu omulala yenna.
But the child is alone.	Naye mwana ali yekka.
I didn’t want to know anything.	Nnali saagala kumanya kintu kyonna.
One per person, please.	Omu buli muntu, nsaba.
That’s what he wants.	Ekyo ayagala.
And for a moment he felt happy.	Era okumala akaseera katono yawulira nga musanyufu.
I could have .	Nnali nsobola .
He wanted to be with her.	Yali ayagala kubeera naye.
Apparently he can talk.	Kirabika asobola okwogera.
In fact, nothing is.	Mu butuufu, tewali kintu kyonna bwe kiri.
He doesn’t really have to.	Mu butuufu talina kukola.
That, of course, is not true.	Ekyo, kya lwatu si kituufu.
Not for a reason.	Si lwa nsonga.
How can I do it.	Nsobola ntya okukikola.
Maybe this will work.	Mpozzi kino kijja kukola.
This is a bit of an issue.	Eno nsonga katono.
You will definitely earn a lot of money here.	Mazima ddala ojja kufuna ssente nnyingi wano.
We both needed it.	Ffembi twali twetaaga.
I might get in trouble.	Nnyinza okufuna obuzibu.
I'm going to the hospital.	Ngenda mu ddwaaliro.
I think it might work.	Ndowooza kiyinza okukola.
Now it is that .	Kati kiri nti .
It was him.	Yali ye.
I am happy now.	Ndi musanyufu kati.
But no one really had.	Naye ddala tewali yali yalina.
You really have to read the whole thing here.	Ddala olina okusoma ekintu kyonna wano.
I thought, just maybe .	Nalowooza nti, mpozzi kyokka .
But it had it.	Naye kyalina.
Eating is not important.	Okulya si kikulu.
He said he didn't.	Yagambye nti nedda.
And it’s good.	Era kirungi.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
I love you too.	Naawe njagala nnyo.
And that was a very good thing.	Era ekyo kyali kintu kirungi nnyo.
He was trying too hard.	Yali agezaako nnyo.
And there is a problem.	Era waliwo obuzibu.
Now that .	Kati nti .
I am always ready.	Bulijjo ndi mwetegefu.
I don’t really care much.	Mu butuufu sifaayo nnyo.
Now it’s true.	Kati kituufu.
However, there is no problem.	Kyokka, tewali buzibu.
Almost all the time, in fact.	Kumpi buli kiseera, mu butuufu.
They were always here.	Bulijjo baali wano.
I’m not sure it will happen.	Sikakasa nti kijja kubaawo.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
He knew he didn’t want to.	Yali akimanyi nti tayagala.
It’s what he was.	Kye kye yali.
He won’t talk at all.	Tajja kwogera n’akatono.
I don’t want to play again today.	Saagala kuddamu kuzannya leero.
I feel like he’s still here.	Mpulira nga akyali wano.
No, tonight was the night.	Nedda, ekiro kino kye kyali ekiro.
We’ll play for a penny.	Tujja kuzannya ku ssente emu.
I need to see, to think.	Nze nneetaaga okulaba, okulowooza.
Hunger was good.	Enjala yali nnungi.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
It’s his place.	Kye kifo kye.
It will go away.	Kijja kugenda.
Everyone is ready to go.	Buli omu mwetegefu okugenda.
He had been friendly.	Yali abadde wa mukwano.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
But he's a good father.	Naye taata mulungi.
However, he got a dog.	Kyokka yafuna embwa.
You can’t do anything.	Tosobola kukola kintu kyonna.
And he was very good.	Era yali mulungi nnyo.
He felt comfortable doing it.	Yawulira bulungi okukikola.
I've got a problem.	Nfunye obuzibu.
This is a great time to do it.	Kino kiseera kirungi nnyo okukikola.
This is not realistic.	Kino si kya ddala.
But it’s much easier than that.	Naye kyangu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He was happy.	Yali musanyufu.
You look good too.	Naawe olabika bulungi.
None, apparently in my case.	Tewali, kirabika mu mbeera yange.
He knew what he expected to get.	Yali amanyi kye yali asuubira okufuna.
My father too.	Taata wange naye.
This was a problem, of course.	Kino kyali kizibu, ddala.
I have phone calls to make.	Nnina essimu ze nnina okukuba.
Everyone had their own agenda.	Buli omu yalina agenda ye.
It will be the same for you.	Kijja kuba kye kimu gy’oli.
Tonight .	Ekiro kya leero .
That is not uncommon.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo.
I don’t think it is.	Ndowooza si bwe kiri.
But maybe it was circumstantial, too.	Naye mpozzi nga kyali kya mbeera, era.
And not just anyone.	Era si muntu yenna yekka.
And he thought he was strong too.	Era yalowooza nti naye yali wa maanyi.
I was always fine.	Bulijjo nnali bulungi.
He had plenty of time.	Yalina obudde bungi.
He had so many plans.	Yalina enteekateeka nnyingi nnyo.
I hope someone can help.	Nsuubira waliwo asobola okuyamba.
Or almost did.	Oba kumpi yakikola.
But he tries.	Naye agezaako.
We can do it, you and I.	Tusobola okukikola, nze naawe.
That’s what we need.	Ekyo kye twetaaga.
No, it was really good.	Nedda, ddala kyali kirungi.
I have no reason to think there is.	Sirina nsonga lwaki ndowooza nti waliwo.
You yourself have a problem here.	Ggwe kennyini olina ekizibu wano.
And each of these is really hard to do.	Era buli kimu ku bino ddala kizibu okukola.
You don’t know when.	Tomanyi ddi.
It was just happening.	Kyali kigenda mu maaso kyokka.
This is what he wanted.	Kino kye yali ayagala.
Not on here in any case.	Si ku wano mu mbeera yonna.
You’re not actually here.	Mu butuufu toli wano.
I’m afraid it was me.	Ntya nti nnali nze.
I might go.	Nnyinza okugenda.
He was terrified.	Yali atya nnyo.
I am all alone.	Nze byonna ndi nzekka.
He is here with me.	Ali wano nange.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
He wanted to do this all night.	Kino yali ayagala okukikola ekiro kyonna.
That goes for whoever.	Ekyo kigenda eri oyo yenna.
Back down there.	Okudda wansi awo.
I don’t want to live at this house.	Saagala kubeera ku nnyumba eno.
Maybe it’s too close.	Mpozzi nga kiri kumpi nnyo.
That we are here is good.	Nti tuli wano kirungi.
Still nothing.	N’okutuusa kati tewali kintu kyonna.
It doesn’t matter which player you belong to.	Si kikulu muzannyi ki gwe wa.
You want to be.	Gwe oyagala okubeera.
He thinks he knows.	Alowooza nti amanyi.
And then he thought of something.	Era awo n’alowooza ku kintu.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
And then it happened.	Era awo nga kigenda mu maaso.
I think this is not your case.	Ndowooza eno si nsonga yo.
Good to be home again.	Kirungi okuddamu okubeera awaka.
But you know.	Naye omanyi.
I hope that it is.	Nsuubira nti bwe kiri.
He was a pleasure to be around.	Yali muntu musanyufu okubeera naye.
It's not the same place at all.	Si kifo kye kimu n'akatono.
But we were in the car at the time.	Naye mu kiseera ekyo twali mu mmotoka.
He was here, he was there.	Yali wano, yali awo.
He doesn’t have any such thing.	Talina kintu ng’ekyo kyonna.
As was the case with everything else.	Nga bwe kyali ku buli kimu.
You are beautiful.	Oli mulungi.
I’ll talk to him and that’s it.	Nja kwogera naye era ekyo kye kiri.
There is food for everyone.	Waliwo emmere eri buli muntu.
I couldn’t find anything to say.	Nnali sisobola kufuna kya kwogera.
This is now.	Kino kiri kati.
He was the one who was speaking.	Ye yali ayogera.
I’m going to do that.	Ekyo ngenda kukikola.
And he doesn’t have it either.	Era naye talina.
My wife says the same thing.	Ne mukyala wange agamba bw’atyo.
I could do this.	Kino nnali nsobola okukikola.
It is a matter of fact.	Ensonga ya mazima.
He loves this movie.	Ayagala nnyo firimu eno.
He slept soundly.	Yeebase bulungi.
We have to come back today.	Tulina kudda leero.
I will be thinking of you.	Nja kuba ndowooza ku ggwe.
That will probably happen next week.	Ekyo osanga kijja kubaawo wiiki ejja.
I can drive anything.	Nsobola okuvuga ekintu kyonna.
He comes to you.	Ajja gy’oli.
He was and is a man.	Yali era ali musajja.
Probably about everything.	Oboolyawo ku buli kimu.
Back to you now.	Okudda gyoli kati.
I don’t have the money.	Nze sirina ssente.
I know that it was.	Nkimanyi nti bwe kyali.
Riding a dog is not easy!.	Okuvuga embwa si kyangu!.
He's not really there.	Tali awo ddala.
The picture is very complex.	Ekifaananyi kizibu nnyo.
He is ready.	Ali mwetegefu.
This is what matters to me.	Kino kye kikulu gyendi.
That was fine at the time.	Ekyo kyali kirungi mu kiseera ekyo.
I said no way.	Nagamba nti tewali ngeri yonna.
It’s not serious.	Si kya maanyi.
Not too much too much.	Si nnyo nnyo nnyo.
You have to know that you can have enough.	Olina okumanya nti osobola okumala.
. . . .	.
This is not serious at all.	Kino si kya maanyi n’akatono.
He did an excellent job.	Yakola omulimu gwa maanyi nnyo.
But it’s also for you.	Naye naawe eri ggwe.
No one could do this.	Kino tewali yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eno.
You were to come alone.	Ggwe wali wa kujja wekka.
He was more real than me.	Yali wa ddala okusinga nze.
I really wanted this.	Kino nnali njagala nnyo.
I'll stay here.	Nja kusigala wano.
I am thinking of the same.	Nze ndowooza ku kye kimu.
In his office.	Mu ofiisi ye.
Trouble is, he doesn’t know how.	Obuzibu, tamanyi ngeri ki.
No one went forward.	Tewali yagenda mu maaso.
I won’t say anything to anyone.	Sijja kwogera kintu kyonna eri omuntu yenna.
It certainly wasn’t my problem.	Mazima ddala si kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
And he probably knew that.	Era oboolyawo ekyo yali akimanyi.
I just ask that you .	Nze nsaba kyokka nti ggwe .
See! 	Okulaba!
I’ll get help, whatever you want.	Nja kufuna obuyambi, kyonna ky’oyagala.
But that’s not really the point.	Naye mu butuufu eyo si y’ensonga.
He had read it all.	Yali amaze okusoma byonna.
It’s not too difficult.	Si kizibu nnyo.
It’s just a moment.	Akaseera katono ddala.
Nothing serious .	Tewali kintu kya maanyi .
You need to think about your strategy.	Olina okulowooza ku nkola yo.
It always goes down.	Bulijjo kigenda wansi.
I need to leave home.	Nze nneetaaga okuva awaka.
And certainly not anything he did.	Era mazima si kintu kyonna kye yakola.
That feels so good.	Ekyo mpulira bulungi nnyo.
And it’s more important than anything.	Era kikulu nnyo okusinga ekintu kyonna.
I could do this.	Kino nnali nsobola okukikola.
The other guy is the problem.	Ggaayi omulala y’alina obuzibu.
You will see in this.	Ojja kulaba mu kino.
But that’s a good thing.	Naye ekyo kirungi.
But, now it doesn’t matter.	Naye, kati si kikulu.
He did his job.	Yakola omulimu gwe.
We can all do better.	Ffenna tusobola okukola obulungi.
Actually, it was good.	Mu butuufu, kyali kirungi.
That's why.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki.
Of course, everyone is trying to do that.	Kya lwatu nti buli omu agezaako okukola ekyo.
It's a bad place.	Kifo kibi.
For that, he would need money.	Ku ekyo, yandibadde yeetaaga ssente.
He certainly didn't want to make any trouble.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala kukola buzibu bwonna.
I'll find the time.	Nja kufuna obudde.
Today is not the day.	Leero si lwe lunaku.
We have to move forward as well.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso nga bwe kiri.
He went to me.	Yagenda gye ndi.
He was a very nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo.
It’s difficult though.	Kizibu wadde.
But, it’s true.	Naye, kituufu.
I’m not anyone’s problem.	Nze siri buzibu bwa muntu yenna.
Probably for just a little while longer.	Oboolyawo okumala akaseera katono ddala.
That’s all that really matters.	Ekyo kyokka kye kikulu ennyo.
He tried to talk to me anyway.	Yagezaako okwogera nange mu ngeri yonna.
It’s not a good feeling.	Si mpulira nnungi.
He almost did swim.	Yali katono akole okuwuga.
It’s going on.	Kigenda mu maaso.
Good, good for you.	Kirungi, kirungi gyoli.
I have the same problem.	Nnina ekizibu kye kimu.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
No patient needs a rehabilitation procedure.	Tewali mulwadde yeetaaga nkola ya kuddamu kuddamu kukola.
That was the thing.	Ekyo kye kyali ekintu.
Really .	Kituufu .
Attitude isn’t everything.	Endowooza si buli kimu.
But that doesn’t seem to be coming.	Naye ekyo kirabika tekijja.
But not for a long long time.	Naye si okumala ebbanga ddene ddene.
No one knew it.	Tewali yali akimanyi.
Is that phone any good? 	Essimu eyo nnungi yonna?
I don’t know why exactly.	Simanyi lwaki ddala.
It was an almost ideal situation.	Yali mbeera kumpi nnungi nnyo.
He's been here.	Abadde wano.
Living there.	Okubeera eyo.
However, that is not the point at all.	Kyokka, eyo si y’ensonga n’akatono.
He knew what he saw.	Yali amanyi kye yalaba.
That was what he was doing.	Ekyo yali akikola.
We are truly lucky.	Ddala tuli ba mukisa.
Neither here nor there.	Wadde wano wadde eyo.
This afternoon, in fact.	Akawungeezi ka leero, mu butuufu.
I have no choice now.	Sirina kye nnyinza kukola kati.
The food is very good.	Emmere eyo nnungi nnyo.
He tried really hard.	Yagezaako nnyo ddala.
I want to be there with my wife.	Njagala kubeerawo ne mukyala wange.
He wants a lot of money.	Ayagala ssente nnyingi.
If he wanted to, he could.	Singa yali ayagala, yali asobola.
In this case, he did.	Mu mbeera eno, yakikola.
He says he doesn’t know.	Agamba nti tamanyi.
Now he wants to do it.	Kati ayagala kukikola.
No, no and no.	Nedda, nedda era nedda.
I could hardly get in trouble.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kufuna buzibu.
No harm in that, he thought.	Tewali bulabe bwonna mu ekyo, bwe yalowooza.
But you said he does have one point.	Naye wagamba nti ddala alina ensonga emu.
That’s the problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu.
I didn’t really know what to say about it either.	Nange mu butuufu nnali simanyi kya kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
That’s easy to answer.	Ekyo kyangu okuddamu.
The problem was, he was happy to be with her.	Obuzibu bwe yali, yali musanyufu okubeera naye.
It is my situation.	Ye mbeera yange.
That’s all he did.	Ekyo kyokka kye yakola.
We need every man.	Twetaaga buli musajja.
And no one knew anyone.	Era tewali yali amanyi muntu yenna.
Here we have one .	Wano tulina emu .
She was his girlfriend.	Ye yali muganzi we.
He must have known we needed him.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali akimanyi nti twetaaga.
No, you have to do it.	Nedda, olina okukikola.
I am really very sorry about this.	Mazima ddala nsonyiwa nnyo ku nsonga eno.
This was not his room.	Kino si kye kyali kisenge kye.
I love the guy.	Njagala nnyo ggaayi.
We’re going to have to see.	Tugenda kuba tulina okulaba.
He knew he was human.	Yali akimanyi nti yali muntu.
I think of it all.	Ndowooza byonna.
But it doesn’t seem to be.	Naye kirabika si bwe kiri.
In his case that's probably the same.	Mu mbeera ye osanga ekyo kye kimu.
This can be a problem.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
Maybe it’s not always easy.	Mpozzi bulijjo si kyangu.
That was the moment.	Ekyo kye kyali akaseera.
He was behind me.	Yali emabega wange.
You can see it happening.	Oyinza okulaba nga kigenda mu maaso.
She will be the best wife.	Ajja kuba mukyala asinga obulungi.
I just wanted to do something to eat.	Nnali njagala kukola kintu kya kulya kyokka.
And it was important to do it quickly .	Era kyali kikulu okukikola mu bwangu .
You are sure to find something you want.	Okakasa nti ojja kufuna ekintu ky’oyagala.
In a way, this doesn’t matter.	Mu ngeri emu, kino si kikulu.
I’m pretty good right now.	Nze ndi mulungi nnyo mu kiseera kino.
There is currently no money.	Mu kiseera kino tewali ssente.
Or he thought he could.	Oba yalowooza nti asobola.
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
But it was time to go.	Naye kyali kiseera kya kugenda.
And he has a reason.	Era alina ensonga.
Nowhere and everywhere.	Tewali wamu na buli wamu.
He had a feeling there was something behind him.	Yalina endowooza nti waliwo ekintu emabega we.
I don’t have any policy.	Sirina nkola yonna.
Almost everywhere.	Kumpi buli wamu.
He said he couldn't tell.	Yagambye nti tasobola kumanya.
Here, you have to work.	Wano, olina okukola.
There and there and there.	Eyo ne eyo ne eyo.
There is no problem here.	Wano tewali buzibu bwonna.
Maybe he’ll come to you.	Mpozzi ajja kujja gy’oli.
I don’t care if they are today.	Sifaayo oba bwe bali leero.
Something could have worked out.	Ekintu kyandibadde kigenda bulungi.
Just what you want.	Kye oyagala kyokka.
He is a very close friend of mine.	Mukwano gwange nnyo.
Very powerful indeed.	Amaanyi nnyo ddala.
Pretty good, actually.	Kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
But that was normal.	Naye ekyo kyali kya bulijjo.
It’s a little party.	Kabaga katono nnyo.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
That would be very difficult.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
I think he has a point.	Ndowooza alina ensonga.
You’re in the house.	Oli mu nnyumba.
My father did the same.	Taata wange bwe yakola.
Not as young as he used to be.	Si muto nga bwe yali.
Always in a hurry.	Bulijjo mu bwangu.
Why are you even here?.	Lwaki oli ne wano?.
And neither do you.	Era naawe tolina.
Or three weeks.	Oba wiiki ssatu.
He could hit very well .	Yali asobola okukuba obulungi ennyo .
No circumstances are involved.	Tewali mbeera yonna eri mu nsonga.
But that’s too easy.	Naye ekyo kyangu nnyo.
This is not a matter of money.	Eno si nsonga ya ssente.
I have no idea about that.	Ekyo sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
In this way.	Mu ngeri eno.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
It’s hard to know what’s going on.	Kizibu okumanya ekigenda mu maaso.
This issue is common.	Ensonga eno ya bulijjo.
He spoke quickly.	Yayogera mu bwangu.
He has to work, a lot.	Alina okukola, ennyo.
He's not a man.	Si musajja.
I hope that .	Nze nsuubira nti .
I wonder what he wants.	Nze nneebuuza ky’ayagala.
He thought about it.	Yalowooza ku nsonga eyo.
Actually, it’s not nearly as hard as it sounds.	Mu butuufu, si kumpi kizibu nga bwe kirabika.
Here no one could say what he was thinking.	Wano tewali yali asobola kwogera kye yali alowooza.
And soon another one.	Era mu bbanga ttono omulala.
And the bus.	Ne bbaasi.
Now there is only this night.	Kati waliwo ekiro kino kyokka.
That’s not realistic.	Ekyo si kya ddala.
There is no one like him.	Tewali muntu yenna nga ye.
He says he will be right back.	Agamba nti ajja kudda amangu ddala.
He was all over her no.	Yali yenna ku ye si ye.
Obviously, they are not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe bali.
This is a friendly atmosphere.	Eno mbeera ya mukwano.
He said he might.	Yagambye nti yandiba.
I'm sorry, Dad.	Nsonyiwa taata.
This is unrealistic, to say the least.	Kino si kya mazima, okugamba nti.
You’re in the hospital.	Oli mu ddwaaliro.
This was a good one.	Eno yali nnungi.
I think he's there now.	Ndowooza kati ali awo.
I will do that here.	Ekyo nja kukikola wano.
You to get .	Ggwe okufuna .
It’s going very well.	Kigenda bulungi nnyo.
I would love to get your feedback.	Njagala nnyo okufuna endowooza yo.
Obviously not here.	Kya lwatu nti wano si bwe kiri.
But they are there.	Naye bali awo.
He couldn't say why but he was.	Yali tasobola kwogera lwaki naye ye yali.
I wonder one thing.	Nze nneebuuza ekintu kimu.
You can do no wrong.	Tosobola kukola kibi kyonna.
Or my dog.	Oba embwa yange.
I can’t do it again.	Sisobola kuddamu kukikola.
Now you have a phone.	Kati olina essimu.
If only he knew what it was.	Singa yali amanyi kye kyali.
He needed to get out of here.	Yali yeetaaga okuva wano.
I guess he needs some time.	Ntebereza nti yeetaaga akaseera.
Who, why, how.	Ani, lwaki, atya.
It was just plain wrong.	Kyali kizibu kya lwatu kyokka.
This is, of course, very true.	Kino, kya lwatu, kituufu nnyo.
We will do this together.	Kino tujja kukikola wamu.
It was what he was.	Kyali kye yali.
I can't see through.	Sisobola kulaba mu.
Am I the one? 	Nze nze?
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
Very early in the morning.	Nga bukyali nnyo.
And in many cases, there is no normal work.	Era mu mbeera nnyingi, tewali mulimu gwa bulijjo.
Nothing to see there.	Tewali kya kulaba awo.
Money is not what matters.	Ssente si kye kikulu.
Or buying a car.	Oba okugula mmotoka.
I won’t have to do it alone.	Sijja kuba na kukikola nzekka.
He's not good enough to even be human.	Si mulungi wadde okubeera omuntu.
I wonder if it’s not true.	Nze nneebuuza oba si kituufu.
He came to me.	Yajja gye ndi.
He had a plan.	Yalina enteekateeka.
He couldn’t.	Yali tasobola.
He thinks this is a good idea.	Alowooza nti kino kirowoozo kirungi.
Not that it was any good.	Si nti kyali kirungi kyonna.
You can’t make more time.	Tosobola kukola budde bungi.
It is a tremendous amount of work.	Omulimu gwa maanyi nnyo.
But it is what it is.	Naye kye kiri.
And that’s what it is.	Era kye kiri ekyo.
And that guy too.	Era ggaayi oyo naye.
A figure like himself.	Ekifaananyi nga ye kennyini.
I could go on, and so can you.	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu maaso, era naawe osobola.
You may be unemployed.	Oyinza okuba nga tolina mulimu.
There is no way.	Tewali ngeri yonna.
It was a complicated problem.	Yali kizibu ekizibu.
It wasn’t what he expected.	Si kye yali asuubira.
I was busy anyway.	Nali bbize mu ngeri yonna.
He must know where he was.	Ateekwa okumanya gye yali.
Getting to know someone is a process.	Okumanya omuntu nkola.
But he should have looked like that.	Naye yandibadde alabika bw’atyo.
He is a friendly guy.	Ye ggaayi wa mukwano.
Maybe you can’t talk.	Mpozzi nga tosobola kwogera.
He wants to go in the car.	Ayagala kugenda mu mmotoka.
He would rather be in jail.	Yandibadde asinga kubeera mu kkomera.
This wasn’t the case.	Eno si bwe yali.
That is a very good point.	Eyo nsonga nnungi nnyo.
I actually love dogs.	Mu butuufu njagala nnyo embwa.
He told me he was a teacher.	Yang’amba nti yali musomesa.
You just have to know how.	Olina kumala kumanya ngeri ki.
Really bad for the money.	Ddala kibi nnyo ku ssente.
He told me he was fine.	Yang’amba nti ali bulungi.
He will do it though.	Ajja kukikola wadde.
He is happy here and wants to stay.	Wano musanyufu era ayagala kusigala.
You are not a doctor.	Ggwe toli musawo.
I don’t want to sidestep.	Saagala kudda ku ludda.
That is what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
Who could speak.	Ani yali asobola okwogera.
Everyone has always said that.	Buli omu abadde ayogera bw’atyo bulijjo.
I’m ready to go home now.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okudda eka kati.
He knew who he was.	Yali amanyi ky’ali.
Not now, of course.	Si kati, ddala.
I wonder who it could be.	Nze nneebuuza ani ayinza okuba.
That was something he would do.	Ekyo kyali kintu kye yandikoze.
He was my only brother.	Ye yali muganda wange yekka.
He felt better already.	Yawulira bulungi dda.
Everyone was nice.	Buli omu yali mulungi.
He didn't want to talk about this.	Kino yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eno.
He was on to something.	Yali ku kintu.
However, this is not the case here.	Kyokka, wano si bwe kiri.
It is truly a sight to behold.	Mazima ddala kifo kya kulaba.
In fact, we all are.	Mu butuufu ffenna tuli.
Probably recycling at home and at school, and that’s important.	Oboolyawo okuddamu okukola ebintu awaka ne ku ssomero, era ekyo kikulu.
And he would be like that.	Era yandibadde bw’atyo.
It was definitely a time constraint.	Mazima ddala kyali kizibu kya budde.
I want it now.	Njagala kati.
You will come now.	Ojja kujja kati.
Not in any way.	Si mu ngeri yonna.
You’ll be there.	Ojja kuba awo.
I will never have this opportunity again.	Sijja kuddamu kufuna mukisa guno.
And it was there,.	Era kyali awo,.
He belongs in the prison.	Ye wa mu kkomera.
Someone looks good.	Waliwo olabika bulungi.
He couldn’t go.	Yali tasobola kugenda.
But that is not true at all.	Naye ekyo si kituufu n’akatono.
He will do it.	Ajja kukikola.
But back to the party.	Naye okudda ku mbaga.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
The opportunity he wanted.	Omukisa gwe yali ayagala.
No, not exactly one idea.	Nedda, si kirowoozo kimu ddala.
And this is basically it.	Era kino okusinga kye kiri.
That’s all he needs now.	Ekyo kyokka kye yeetaaga kati.
We have neither the time nor the money.	Tetulina budde wadde ssente.
He was a young man.	Yali musajja muto.
No one but you.	Tewali muntu yenna okuggyako ggwe.
They are here all the time.	Bali wano buli kiseera.
I know it seems.	Nkimanyi nti kirabika.
It was good for me.	Kyali kirungi gyendi.
My father was in the room.	Taata yali mu kisenge.
He knew he couldn’t stay.	Yali akimanyi nti tasobola kusigala.
And it’s true.	Era kituufu.
I need help.	Njagala buyambi.
He should have known better.	Yandibadde amanyi bulungi.
That's basically what it is.	Ekyo okusinga kye kiri.
I was just a kid.	Nnali mwana muto yekka.
The food was good.	Emmere yali nnungi.
You knew he would be there, of course.	Obadde okimanyi nti ajja kubaawo, ddala.
Everyone has a favorite.	Buli muntu alina ky’ayagala ennyo.
He loves to do those things.	Ayagala nnyo okukola ebintu ebyo.
Not that it would matter to you.	Si nti kyandibadde kikulu gy’oli.
He would love to see it go.	Yandiyagadde nnyo okulaba nga kigenda.
But just a little bit.	Naye katono ddala.
Nothing can ever be the same again.	Tewali kintu kyonna kiyinza kuddamu kubeera kye kimu.
Nor anyone else for that matter.	Wadde omuntu omulala yenna ku nsonga eyo.
I won’t be here long.	Sijja kubeera wano bbanga ddene.
He has a friend who loves him.	Alina mukwano gwe ayagala.
And no one did anything.	Era tewali yakola kintu kyonna.
For you and you.	Ku ggwe naawe.
He did well.	Yakola bulungi.
I can’t do anything with him.	Sisobola kukola kintu kyonna naye.
Obviously, it is true.	Kya lwatu nti kituufu.
Maybe for him, it is.	Mpozzi ku ye, bwe kiri.
But the problem is.	Naye ekizibu kiri nti.
No one knew in advance.	Tewali yali amanyi nga bukyali.
And that’s great to know.	Era ekyo kirungi nnyo okumanya.
I want to go.	Njagala kugenda.
Which he said as before.	Gwe yagamba nga bwe kyali emabegako.
That’s what I was doing.	Ekyo kye nnali nkola.
It is in this position.	Eri mu kifo kino.
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
It is good in every way.	Kirungi mu buli ngeri.
We have to do things but we can’t.	Tulina okukola ebintu naye tetusobola.
He had been a good friend.	Yali abadde mukwano gwe omulungi.
There is something.	Waliwo ekintu.
And we will do it.	Era tujja kukikola.
As it is, it is.	Nga bwe kiri.
He knew it now.	Yali akimanyi kati.
Like, you know, someone.	Nga, omanyi, omuntu.
He expected me to know.	Yali asuubira nti nja kumanya.
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
That’s fine and good.	Ekyo kirungi era kirungi.
Who did that, he said.	Ani yakola ekyo, bwe yagambye.
The reason we are here.	Ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
You make a lot of money.	Okola ssente nnyingi nnyo.
In fact, he knew what to expect.	Mu butuufu, yali amanyi kye yali asuubira.
I don’t know anything.	Sirina kye mmanyi.
Not for a really long time.	Si lwa bbanga ddene ddala.
He knew he had slept soundly.	Yali akimanyi nti yeebase bulungi.
Everyone came to me.	Buli omu yajja gyendi.
I hope we don’t have a serious problem.	Nsuubira tetulina kizibu kya maanyi.
We do not have .	Tetulina .
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
It’s good that it is.	Kirungi nti bwe kiri.
He'll be here soon.	Ajja kuba wano mu bbanga ttono.
Indeed .	Ddala, ddala .
To me everything is fine.	Eri nze buli kimu kiri bulungi.
Maybe it’s true.	Mpozzi nga kituufu.
It was really bad.	Ddala kyali kibi.
This seems very, very bad.	Kino kirabika kibi nnyo nnyo.
He looked completely normal.	Yalabika nga wa bulijjo ddala.
It’s a work thing.	Kintu kya mulimu.
That is the reality as well.	Ekyo kye kituufu nga bwe kiri.
I love the job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu.
I'll talk to him.	Nja kwogera naye.
He was always very strong.	Bulijjo yali wa maanyi nnyo.
It will work, of course.	Kijja kukola, ddala.
Just like they were now.	Nga bwe baali kati.
And everyone was making money.	Era buli omu yali akola ssente.
That's not a bad thing!.	Ekyo si kibi!.
This was not the case at all.	Kino si bwe kyali n’akatono.
And you just know.	Era ggwe omanyi kyokka.
But he can’t do it.	Naye tasobola kukola.
He is willing to talk.	Ye mwetegefu okwogera.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
As he should have been.	Nga bwe yandibadde.
Where are they now?.	Kati bali ludda wa?.
This is my office.	Eno ye ofiisi yange.
You’re at work.	Oli ku mulimu.
I have to go back to school.	Nnina okudda ku ssomero.
You can see this happening.	Osobola okulaba nga kino kigenda mu maaso.
Easy, maybe, but not easy.	Kyangu, mpozzi, naye si kyangu.
I suppose it’s something to do.	Nsuubira nti kintu kya kukola.
In fact, that is not the case.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si bwe kiri.
He was fast asleep.	Yali yeebase nnyo.
Not bad, really.	Si kibi, ddala.
It was really easy actually .	Ddala kyali kyangu mu butuufu .
But he thought he did.	Naye yalowooza nti yakikola.
And then, it’s fine.	Era awo, kirungi.
I have to do this.	Kino nnina okukikola.
He didn't think he should.	Yali talowooza nti yandibadde akikola.
My brother, you know.	Muganda wange, omanyi.
Maybe it’s nothing.	Mpozzi nga tewali kintu kyonna.
Right now, you don’t have that option.	Mu kiseera kino, tolina nkola eyo.
I was always here.	Bulijjo nnali wano.
However, what it can do .	Kyokka, kye kiyinza okukola .
That's what he said.	Kye kimu kye yayogera.
It’s really nice.	Kirungi ddala.
No one can help now.	Tewali asobola kuyamba kati.
That’s pretty much what it is.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo kye kiri.
We'll just talk.	Tujja kumala kwogera.
I know a lot of things.	Nze mmanyi ebintu bingi.
He came with me.	Yajja nange.
There is no waiting.	Tewali kulinda.
I work hard to say no.	Nkola nnyo okugamba nti nedda.
But no, we are.	Naye nedda, ffe tuli.
So he did it in his time.	Bwatyo yakikola mu kiseera kye.
That was something.	Ekyo kyali kintu.
You may do whatever you want to do.	Oyinza okukola kyonna ky’oyagala okukola.
We had no problems.	Twali tetulina buzibu bwonna.
One whole week.	Wiiki emu yonna.
And he is very dangerous.	Era wa bulabe nnyo.
We were in a difficult place.	Twali mu kifo kizibu.
But everyone has their own job.	Naye buli omu alina omulimu gwe.
That would be one thing.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu kimu.
And he would have to.	Era yandibadde alina okukikola.
It’s a good thing.	Kintu kirungi.
But he hadn’t seen anything yet.	Naye yali tannaba kulaba kintu kyonna.
I don’t know how that can be.	Ekyo simanyi ngeri ki gye kiyinza okuba.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
Not in this house.	Si mu nnyumba eno.
I feel like I’m in a hurry.	Mpulira nga ndi bwangu.
We have to act now.	Tulina okukola kati.
Something for everyone.	Ekintu kya buli muntu.
He probably doesn’t think anyone is good enough for me.	Oboolyawo talowooza nti waliwo omuntu yenna mulungi gyendi.
It would be a bad thing.	Kyandibadde kibi.
Just going backwards.	Okudda emabega kyokka.
I might do something like this.	Nnyinza okukola ekintu nga kino.
In fact, everyone should be here soon.	Mu butuufu buli muntu yandibadde wano mu bbanga ttono.
And now it isn’t.	Era kati si bwe kiri.
At this point he had no interest whatsoever.	Mu kiseera kino yali talina ky’ayagala kyonna.
I can’t believe you’re coming here alone.	Siyinza kukkiriza nti ojja wano wekka.
He is still beautiful.	Akyali mulungi.
Anything at all.	Kyonna n’akatono.
She wanted as much as he wanted.	Yali ayagala nga ye bwe yali ayagala.
The hour is near.	Essaawa eri kumpi.
That’s not what’s at issue.	Ekyo si kye kiri mu nsonga.
It really doesn’t matter to me.	Mazima ddala si kikulu gyendi.
He couldn't see anything from here.	Yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna okuva wano.
You are nothing.	Ggwe toli kintu kyonna.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
We were going to play hard.	Twali tugenda kuzannya nnyo.
I’m doing whatever.	Nze nkola kyonna.
Exactly the same thing, but whatever.	Kintu kye kimu ddala, naye kyonna.
I always want to win.	Bulijjo njagala kuwangula.
Knowledge is really power.	Okumanya ddala maanyi.
This is a difficult thing.	Kino kintu kizibu.
He would do that.	Ekyo yandikoze.
Yeah, well.	Ye, bulungi.
He will be on his way home from work now.	Ajja kuba agenda okudda eka okuva ku mulimu kati.
In this way, please .	Mu ngeri eno, nsaba .
However, he was there or something.	Kyokka yali awo oba ekintu kye kyali.
All by yourself.	Byonna wekka.
I hear my brother.	Mpulira muganda wange.
But the picture is more complex than this.	Naye ekifaananyi kizibu okusinga kino.
Like seeing that.	Nga okulaba ekyo.
Perhaps they were.	Oboolyawo bwe baali.
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
It was just beautiful.	Kyali kirungi kyokka.
I’m willing to do anything.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola ekintu kyonna.
He was on the floor.	Yali wansi.
In fact, it will.	Mu butuufu, kijja.
Nothing could be more difficult.	Tewali kiyinza kuba kizibu okusinga ekyo.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
Really, that’s why we’re here.	Ddala, y’ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
I can’t do something like this.	Sisobola kukola kintu nga kino.
It’s not mine.	Si kyange.
And he couldn’t.	Era yali tasobola.
That’s very true here.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo wano.
You can’t tell anyone.	Tosobola kubuulira muntu yenna.
That is a beautiful woman, and she looks good.	Oyo mukyala mulungi, era alabika bulungi.
That will all be for today.	Ekyo kyonna kijja kuba kya leero.
Throughout this period.	Mu kiseera kino kyonna.
That was it, of course.	Ekyo kye kyali, ddala.
He was in danger.	Yali mu bulabe.
I'll wait.	Nja kulinda.
That was dangerous.	Ekyo kyali kya bulabe.
This is a terrible thing.	Kino kibi nnyo.
I know very little.	Nze mmanyi katono ddala.
That’s not what I knew.	Ekyo si kye nnali mmanyi.
A few moments alone.	Akaseera katono nga oli wekka.
I will never go back this way again.	Sijja kuddamu kudda mu ngeri eno.
No one actually said anything.	Mu butuufu tewali yayogera kintu kyonna.
It won’t happen though.	Tekijja kubaawo wadde.
He only has you.	Alina ggwe kyokka.
This is good and bad for you.	Kino kirungi era kibi gy’oli.
That was not a good place to be.	Ekyo kyali kifo si kirungi okubeera.
Maybe it’s time.	Mpozzi nga kye kiseera.
It may be temporary.	Kiyinza okuba nga kya kiseera.
It doesn’t really matter.	Si kikulu nnyo.
No child can.	Tewali mwana asobola.
He was very sick, of course.	Yali mulwadde nnyo, ddala.
We cannot accept this fact.	Tetusobola kukkiriza nsonga eno.
It was, and still is, a powerful concept.	Yali, era n’okutuusa kati, ndowooza ya maanyi nnyo.
He was always with us.	Bulijjo yali naffe.
I don’t really care.	Sifaayo nnyo.
But nothing is absolutely right.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna kituufu ddala.
He felt everything.	Yawulira buli kimu.
He didn't know what.	Yali tamanyi ki.
I needed him, too.	Nnali nneetaaga naye.
He didn’t do anything.	Tewali kye yakola.
But that’s not entirely true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu ddala.
Now here they were.	Kati wano we baali.
It’s easy now.	Kyangu kati.
There is power in that.	Mu ekyo mulimu amaanyi.
And if this were true .	Era singa kino kyali kituufu .
Of course, this was it.	Kya lwatu nti kino kye kyali.
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
I am friendly and hardworking.	Ndi wa mukwano era nkola nnyo.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
Like, a long time.	Nga, ebbanga ddene.
It’s not realistic.	Si kya ddala.
He wants to do it alone.	Ayagala kukikola yekka.
It’s really important.	Ddala kikulu nnyo.
This is what really matters.	Kino kye kikulu ennyo.
In all .	Mu byonna .
But yes, he has a point.	Naye ye, alina ensonga.
He wasn’t thinking clearly.	Yali talowooza bulungi.
I needed to help.	Nnali nneetaaga okuyamba.
Like a car.	Nga mmotoka.
It’s in the house.	Eri mu nnyumba.
He was finished.	Yali amaze.
In my opinion, it’s not a good thing.	Mu ndowooza yange, si kintu kirungi.
Everything is pretty much the same.	Buli kimu kye kimu nnyo.
I just want to know soon.	Njagala kumanya mangu kyokka.
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
Indeed, he probably was.	Mazima ddala, oboolyawo bwe yali.
He just has to be fine.	Alina okuba bulungi kyokka.
At any moment anything can happen.	Mu kiseera kyonna ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo.
I thought you knew.	Nalowooza nti omanyi.
And it started very well.	Era yatandika bulungi nnyo.
But it can be very difficult.	Naye kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
He was a man of .	Yali musajja wa .
He didn’t want to talk to her at all.	Yali tayagala kwogera naye n’akatono.
Now he had his money.	Kati yalina ssente ze.
But he is also on point.	Naye era ali ku nsonga.
I was a very strong man.	Nnali musajja wa maanyi nnyo.
No one is afraid now.	Tewali atya kati.
A little bit of the same.	Katono ku kimu.
But he could do with this.	Naye yali asobola okukola ne kino.
But yes, it was fine.	Naye ye, kyali kirungi.
He didn’t need time.	Yali teyeetaaga budde.
We’re both hungry.	Ffembi tulina enjala.
My point is that there isn’t.	Ensonga yange eri nti tewali.
What we have is money.	Kye tulina ssente.
He loves to talk.	Ayagala nnyo okwogera.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
But he has me.	Naye alina nze.
No one is talking to him.	Tewali ayogera naye.
It will be good.	Kijja kuba kirungi.
Maybe everything was real.	Mpozzi buli kimu kyali kya ddala.
He knew what he had to do.	Yali amanyi kye yalina okukola.
What the hell, he thought.	Kiki ekizibu, bwe yalowooza.
Everyone can and should and should.	Buli muntu asobola era yandibadde era alina.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
I feel so lucky right now.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa nnyo mu kiseera kino.
He didn't know how to answer.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ya kuddamu.
Although they are not.	Wadde nga si bwe bali.
Nowhere, nowhere did he look safe.	Tewali we, tewali we yali alabika nga tewali bulabe.
He can’t do this.	Kino tasobola kukikola.
Now he did it.	Kati yakikola.
He was always going to be there.	Bulijjo yali agenda kubeerawo.
I know it looks great from the front.	Nkimanyi nti kirabika bulungi nnyo okuva mu maaso.
This is what.	Kino kye ki...
It’s not very good.	Si nnungi nnyo.
That's why he came.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki yajja.
He did, but not for long.	Yakikola, naye si kumala bbanga ddene.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
Or so he said.	Oba bwatyo bwe yagamba.
go! 	okugenda!
go! 	okugenda!
I have so much money to make.	Nnina ssente nnyingi nnyo okukola.
And, in fact, it was.	Era, mu butuufu, bwe kyali.
He knew everything now.	Buli kimu yali akimanyi kati.
As he would have done.	Nga bwe yandikoze.
He could think quickly.	Yali asobola okulowooza amangu.
I work with him.	Nkola naye.
Maybe that was the problem.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
I can't find anything to do here.	Wano sisobola kufuna kya kukola.
This seems serious.	Kino kirabika nga kya maanyi.
I don't know where.	Simanyi wa.
He tells everyone.	Agamba buli muntu.
I love the planning and feeling.	Njagala nnyo enteekateeka era mpulira.
And we have it.	Era tulina.
But today it is true.	Naye leero kituufu.
You can, or really.	Osobola, oba ddala.
It was anything but that.	Kyali kintu kyonna okuggyako ekyo.
But I’m the only one.	Naye nze nzekka.
And that’s not true.	Era ekyo si kituufu.
He had one younger brother.	Yalina muto omu.
That’s what you want for a child.	Ekyo oyagala ku mwana.
To me that’s a problem.	Eri nze ekyo kizibu.
Nothing .	Tewali .
That is a serious problem.	Ekyo kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I don’t want to work.	Saagala kukola.
No nothing, actually.	Nedda tewali kintu kyonna, mu butuufu.
Everyone should go.	Buli omu yandibadde agenda.
You know this.	Kino okimanyi.
He should be in jail.	Alina okuba mu kkomera.
At the time that was everything.	Mu kiseera ekyo ekyo kye kyali buli kimu.
Most everyone wants to.	Okusinga buli omu ayagala.
It was simple and complicated.	Kyali kyangu era nga kizibu.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
You are the one.	Ggwe oli omu.
Indeed, why not.	Mazima ddala, lwaki nedda.
You have to know they were.	Olina okumanya nti baali.
You want to go fast.	Oyagala kugenda mangu.
Actually, it’s neither good nor bad.	Mu butuufu, si kirungi oba kibi.
He didn’t know he was here.	Yali tamanyi nti ali wano.
It's down down there.	Kiri wansi wansi awo.
Nothing mattered except being with him.	Tewali kyali kikulu okuggyako okubeera naye.
It really is time to go.	Ddala kye kiseera okugenda.
But he looked like me, and that was dangerous.	Naye yali alabika nga wange era ekyo kyali kya bulabe.
He shouldn’t do it.	Tasaanidde kukikola.
Obviously it will be hard to read.	Kya lwatu kijja kuba kizibu okusoma.
Someone had to be him.	Waliwo omuntu yalina okuba nga ye.
The point is that.	Ensonga eri nti.
It’s not a systematic approach.	Si nkola ya nkola.
Very good indeed.	Kirungi nnyo ddala.
However, please be sure to always make an appointment.	Kyokka, nsaba okakasa nti bulijjo okola essaawa.
I’m sure he’s fine.	Nkakasa nti ali bulungi.
No, that’s not quite right.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
And that's really my opinion on this.	Era eyo ddala ndowooza yange ku nsonga eno.
Not a child.	Si mwana.
That’s something, right?.	Ekyo kintu, nedda?.
It’s true though.	Kituufu wadde.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I wanted to know everything.	Nnali njagala okumanya buli kimu.
Just a little bit lower.	Wansi katono ddala.
I'm sure, about that.	Nkakasa, ku ekyo.
He was still her child.	Yali akyali mwana we.
He had a house.	Yalina ennyumba.
Not a man yet.	Si musajja n’okutuusa kati.
He is a good person.	Ye muntu mulungi.
He can drive again.	Asobola okuddamu okuvuga.
Returning home.	Okudda eka.
He had been saying that for a long time.	Yali amaze ebbanga ddene okwogera ekyo.
I don’t care.	Sifaayo.
The picture was simple.	Ekifaananyi kyali kyangu.
It’s hard to live here.	Kizibu okubeera wano.
He is still almost powerless.	N’okutuusa kati kumpi talina maanyi.
It is a very common problem.	Kizibu kya bulijjo nnyo.
However, one will agree that it looks good.	Kyokka omuntu ajja kukkiriza nti kirabika bulungi.
We are both real.	Ffembi tuli ba ddala.
You don’t have to come to me.	Tolina kujja gye ndi.
And no .	Era nedda .
It wasn’t that close.	Si bwe yali kumpi nnyo.
It is good for you to do .	Kirungi ggwe okukola .
He loves to go home.	Ayagala nnyo okudda eka.
Really.	Kituufu.
I have everything to do.	Nnina buli kimu kye nnina okukola.
He needed a plan.	Yali yeetaaga enteekateeka.
And in a way, he did.	Era mu ngeri emu, yakikola.
This is actually pretty cool!.	Kino mu butuufu kirungi nnyo!.
You have to live with yourself.	Olina okubeera naawe kennyini.
Plan, plan, plan.	Enteekateeka, enteekateeka, enteekateeka.
It’s not really a city.	Mu butuufu si kibuga.
Everything would be fine.	Buli kimu kyandibadde bulungi.
It was an ordinary room.	Kyali kisenge kya bulijjo.
I don’t have a child.	Nze sirina mwana.
So he had it too.	Bw’atyo naye bwe yalina.
I’ll make dinner.	Nja kukola ekyeggulo.
I wanted to talk to everyone about anything.	Nnali njagala okwogera ne buli muntu ku kintu kyonna.
Perhaps that was lucky for his wife.	Oboolyawo ekyo kyali kya mukisa eri mukyala we.
You have to eat well.	Olina okulya obulungi.
And it’s not true.	Era si kituufu.
I should go for this.	Nze nsaanidde okugenda ku kino.
He couldn't quite work out which.	Yali tasobola bulungi kukola ku ki.
In your own way.	Mu ngeri yo.
He is a very good friend.	Mukwano mulungi nnyo.
Does anyone know why? 	Waliwo amanyi lwaki?
And he has the best personality.	Era alina omuntu asinga obulungi.
I can do it faster myself.	Nsobola okukikola amangu nzekka.
It’s too easy for you.	Kyangu nnyo gy’oli.
Almost three hours.	Kumpi essaawa ssatu.
For him alone.	Ku ye yekka.
Maybe a little too happy.	Mpozzi nga musanyufu nnyo katono.
I wanted a friend.	Nnali njagala mukwano.
No one spoke at all.	Tewali yayogera n’akatono.
But I think there is a problem.	Naye ndowooza waliwo obuzibu.
Difficult, but so easy.	Ekizibu, naye nga kyangu nnyo.
Night was leading to morning.	Ekiro kyali kigenda ku makya.
He knows better than to do that.	Amanyi bulungi okusinga okukola ekyo.
So far, not bad.	N’okutuusa kati, si kibi.
He couldn’t do anything.	Yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
I hope not too long.	Nsuubira nti si bbanga ddene nnyo.
But we are all like him.	Naye ffenna tuli nga ye.
But you know you have so much in you.	Naye okimanyi nti olina bingi nnyo mu ggwe.
I don’t have any space.	Nze sirina kifo kyonna.
So far nothing good.	N'okutuusa kati tewali kirungi.
I have a plan.	Nnina enteekateeka.
He probably doesn’t want to.	Oboolyawo tayagala.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
And he couldn’t.	Era yali tasobola.
It might have been the clock.	Kiyinza okuba nga kyali kya ssaawa.
There was no way he could do this.	Tewali ngeri yonna gye yandikoze kino.
Someone is doing it.	Waliwo akikola.
Now, that would be bad.	Kati, ekyo kyandibadde kibi.
Everyone was happy.	Buli omu yali musanyufu.
I feel so much better this morning.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo enkya ya leero.
Or you don’t have to do it.	Oba tolina kukikola.
I’m scared too.	Nze nange ntya.
He looked almost happy.	Yalabika kumpi nga musanyufu.
He was good to me.	Yali mulungi gyendi.
This is simply not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri kyokka.
And, frankly, he could see why.	Era, mu butuufu, yali asobola okulaba lwaki.
He can’t say what he wants.	Tasobola kwogera ky’ayagala.
It was a problem.	Yali buzibu.
That’s what we should be doing.	Ekyo tusaanidde okukikola.
It worked very well and still does.	Yakola bulungi nnyo era n’okutuusa kati.
And you have to be there.	Era olina okubeera eyo.
She is not his wife.	Si ye mukyala we.
For a while it was great.	Okumala akaseera kyali kirungi nnyo.
We’ll go over the plan.	Tujja kugenda ku nteekateeka.
It was dangerous, dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe, nga kya bulabe.
I couldn’t see clearly.	Nnali sisobola kulaba bulungi.
This is not realistic.	Kino si kya ddala.
I won’t be back in the office this afternoon.	Sijja kudda mu ofiisi akawungeezi ka leero.
Everyone knows this about me.	Kino buli omu akimanyi ku nze.
And we can’t be everywhere at the same time.	Era tetusobola kubeera buli wamu mu kiseera kye kimu.
But it was sudden.	Naye kyali kya mangu.
This was urgent.	Kino kyali kya mangu.
In the wedding.	Mu mbaga.
Nobody had that.	Ekyo tewali yalina.
I 'm also	Nze nange .
And it was very powerful.	Era kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
This is a serious job.	Omulimu guno gwa maanyi.
As was the scene.	Nga bwe kyali mu kifo.
Everyone has my opinion.	Buli muntu alina endowooza yange.
That will do it.	Ekyo kijja kukikola.
What a beautiful child you are.	Nga oli mwana mulungi.
There is no policy of any kind.	Tewali nkola ya ngeri yonna.
And everyone knows that .	Era buli omu akimanyi nti .
Someone is talking to me.	Waliwo ayogera nange.
You are a beautiful child.	Oli mwana mulungi.
It will be great for all of us.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo eri ffenna.
He was so good at that.	Ekyo yali mulungi nnyo.
But he wasn’t just good.	Naye yali si mulungi yekka.
That's completely up to you though.	Ekyo kiri gyoli ddala wadde.
He has, he doesn’t.	Alina, talina.
He is my doctor.	Ye musawo wange.
And that’s not a problem.	Era ekyo si kizibu.
You’re a lover.	Oli muganzi.
Wish .	Si nga .
And he is very, very happy.	Era musanyufu nnyo nnyo.
I think he moved on.	Ndowooza yagenda mu maaso.
From the same.	Okuva ku kimu.
My father went all out.	Taata yagenda byonna.
I am the same me all the time.	Nze nze omu buli kiseera.
Everyone on me.	Buli muntu ku nze.
This would be a movie movie.	Kino kyandibadde kya firimu ya firimu.
We don’t have the money.	Tetulina ssente.
And herein lies the point.	Era wano we wali ensonga.
And that can happen in the office.	Era ekyo kiyinza okubaawo mu ofiisi.
And no, it wasn’t.	Era nedda, si bwe kyali.
You won’t be able to last long.	Tojja kusobola kumala bbanga ddene.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
He was probably in a hurry.	Oboolyawo yali mu bwangu.
That’s a low thing to say.	Ekyo kintu kya wansi okwogera.
They were best friends.	Baali ba mukwano gwa mukwano.
That's what my father wants.	Ekyo taata ky'ayagala.
It may be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
This is the time of today.	Kino kye kiseera kya leero.
But you probably won’t be able to.	Naye osanga tojja kusobola.
He just wanted to be around her.	Yali ayagala kubeera kumpi naye yekka.
However, that is not true for me.	Kyokka, ekyo si kituufu gyendi.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
This problem is very real.	Ekizibu kino kya ddala nnyo.
But he thought maybe he would do better.	Naye yalowooza nti osanga ajja kukola bulungi.
He was always very sick.	Bulijjo yali mulwadde nnyo.
I’m sure it’s not.	Nkakasa nti si bwe kiri.
However, only a little.	Kyokka, katono ddala.
You need to know what’s going on.	Olina okumanya ekigenda mu maaso.
He needed help.	Yali yeetaaga obuyambi.
And in an hour.	Era mu ssaawa emu.
I had no time to do anything.	Nnali sirina budde bwa kukola kintu kyonna.
Everyone works hard.	Buli muntu akola nnyo.
I don’t care either.	Nze era sifaayo.
You would love it.	Wandyagadde nnyo.
It’s a good idea.	Kirowoozo kirungi.
And he obviously knows so much more than we do.	Era kirabika amanyi bingi nnyo okusinga ffe.
Beautiful, but problematic.	Mulungi, naye obuzibu.
No problem there.	Tewali buzibu eyo.
I wanted that more than anything.	Ekyo nnali njagala okusinga ekintu kyonna.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
He will see that.	Ajja kulaba ekyo.
It really goes down.	Ddala kigenda wansi.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
And anyone can do it.	Era omuntu yenna asobola okukikola.
We should be here.	Tusaanidde okubeera wano.
I have the background.	Nnina emabega.
I knew everyone in the movie.	Nnali mmanyi buli muntu mu firimu eyo.
We don’t have the money for that.	Ekyo tetulina ssente.
I have to move on.	Nnina okugenda mu maaso.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
I thought it was something of that nature.	Nalowooza nti yali kintu kya ngeri eyo.
No one knows this.	Kino tewali akimanyi.
But it will come.	Naye kijja kujja.
But, of course, that’s just not really the case.	Naye, ddala, ekyo kyokka si bwe kiri ddala.
No reason, really.	Tewali nsonga, ddala.
Not much there, obviously.	Si bingi awo, kya lwatu.
. . . .	.
I didn’t know exactly.	Nnali simanyi bulungi.
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
Went to dinner.	Yagenda okulya ekyeggulo.
He didn't think he really wanted to know.	Yali talowooza nti ddala ayagala kumanya.
He is still my child.	Akyali mwana wange.
And you will get a job.	Era ojja kufuna omulimu.
I’m sorry about everything.	Nsonyiwa ku buli kimu.
We need everyone we can get.	Twetaaga buli muntu gwe tusobola okufuna.
I know this as much as anyone.	Kino nkimanyi nnyo nga omuntu yenna.
Great for healthy eating.	Kirungi nnyo eri okulya obulungi.
She certainly looked good.	Mazima ddala yalabika bulungi.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
But he has.	Naye alina...
This is very realistic.	Kino kya ddala nnyo.
There is only this .	Waliwo kino kyokka .
We should	Tusaanidde .
I can’t talk for long.	Sisobola kwogera bbanga ddene.
Excellent work.	Omulimu mulungi nnyo.
You’re not the only one in the movie.	Ggwe wekka toli mu firimu.
I couldn’t believe my luck.	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza mukisa gwange.
Certainly, this was not what anyone wanted.	Mazima ddala, kino si kye kyali omuntu yenna kye yali ayagala.
In the movie.	Mu firimu.
In fact, that is not the case.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si bwe kiri.
It’s bad for you.	Kibi gy’oli.
That’s bad for you.	Ekyo kibi gy’oli.
But there was another guy.	Naye nga waliwo ne ggaayi omulala.
That’s probably true.	Ekyo oboolyawo kituufu.
He will do whatever he wants.	Ajja kukola kyonna ky’ayagala.
It was his work really.	Yali mulimu gwe ddala.
He could do this.	Kino yali asobola okukikola.
He was a lovely person to be around.	Yali muntu ayagala nnyo okubeera naye.
No one seemed to know what to say.	Tewali yali alabika amanyi kya kwogera.
For my own sake.	Ku nsonga yange.
But it’s not what we have here.	Naye si kye tulina wano.
To me, they were both one in the same.	Eri nze, bombi baali kimu mu kimu.
In fact, this is not true at all.	Mu butuufu, kino si kituufu n’akatono.
Now he is my best friend.	Kati ye mukwano gwange ennyo.
He was a normal person now.	Yali muntu wa bulijjo kati.
I needed to do that too.	Ekyo nange nnali nneetaaga okukikola.
We don’t have time for that.	Ekyo tetulina budde.
It was a good feeling.	Yali mpulira nnungi.
We will have to go.	Tujja kuba tulina okugenda.
And there is a problem.	Era waliwo ekizibu.
Son, you are	Mwana, oli .
I just want to say.	Njagala kwogera kyokka.
Nothing to see here.	Tewali kya kulaba wano.
This will always be helpful.	Kino kijja kuba kya kuyamba bulijjo.
But it is an ancient city.	Naye kibuga kya dda.
For a moment no one spoke.	Okumala akaseera katono tewali yayogera.
We just need to try.	Twetaaga kugezaako kyokka.
But he can’t do it alone.	Naye tasobola kukikola yekka.
Not just to me, to everyone.	Si gyendi nzekka, eri buli muntu.
We are going to the city.	Tugenda mu kibuga.
Work, work, work.	Omulimu, omulimu, omulimu.
If he had, you would know.	Singa yalina, wandibadde okimanyi.
This is very dangerous indeed.	Kino kya bulabe nnyo ddala.
But he didn’t know where.	Naye yali tamanyi wa.
I don’t have anything.	Sirina kintu.
I was terrified to do the same.	Nali ntya nnyo okukola kye kimu.
He'll be fine now that you're here.	Ajja kuba bulungi kati nga oli wano.
And he was very strong.	Era nga wa maanyi nnyo.
He can make a lot of money.	Asobola okukola ssente nnyingi.
Not this anytime soon.	Si kino mu bbanga ttono.
But he had it.	Naye yalina.
My father could do nothing.	Taata yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
To us, this is actually a good thing.	Eri ffe, mu butuufu kino kintu kirungi.
Not my friend.	Si mukwano gwange.
You're coming with me tomorrow.	Ojja nange enkya.
A blessing to be a blessing.	Omukisa okubeera omukisa.
But he is not alone.	Naye si ye yekka.
I have no idea either.	Nze nange sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
It was a job he loved.	Omulimu gwe yali ayagala nnyo.
That one was fast.	Oyo yali wa mangu.
It’s not exactly a good thing.	Si kintu kirungi ddala.
But we can’t do it without you.	Naye tetusobola kukikola nga tolina.
He asked	Yasaba .
This was very easy to do.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo okukola.
That was myself.	Ekyo kye nnali nze kennyini.
He doesn’t know how to stay in place.	Tamanyi ngeri ya kusigala mu kifo.
I can’t say why right now.	Siyinza kwogera lwaki mu kiseera kino.
Last Monday, they were.	Mmande ewedde, baali...
But it’s not my house.	Naye si nnyumba yange.
But maybe not now.	Naye mpozzi si kati.
He just didn't know what it was.	Yali tamanyi kiki kyokka.
But he thought he would try anyway.	Naye yalowooza nti ajja kugezaako mu ngeri yonna.
I go regularly.	Ngenda bulijjo.
And it could be anyone.	Era kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
It’s not one of those.	Si kimu ku ebyo.
He would do the same thing.	Yandikoze ekintu kye kimu.
He's been good.	Abadde mulungi.
I can do all things.	Nsobola okukola ebintu byonna.
He couldn't say that.	Ekyo yali tasobola kwogera.
Whoever he was, he was strong.	Oyo yenna gwe yali, yali wa maanyi.
He doesn’t know me.	Tamanyi nze.
But it’s not quite right.	Naye si kituufu nnyo.
You are a very good singer.	Oli muyimbi mulungi nnyo.
But it’s not the only place.	Naye si kye kifo kyokka.
But he himself thought nothing of the sort.	Naye ye kennyini yali talowooza ku kintu kyonna ng’ekyo.
Now, we can do better.	Kati, tusobola okukola obulungi.
And it isn’t.	Era si bwe kiri.
I wanted to go home.	Nnali njagala kudda waka.
But, that wasn’t the point for us.	Naye, eyo si ye yali ensonga gye tuli.
Not like my father.	Si nga taata wange.
That’s what it is, right?.	Kye kiri, nedda?.
Not with him.	Si naye.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
That’s very much in your way.	Ekyo kiri mu ngeri yo nnyo.
I won’t be without any problems.	Sijja kuba tewali buzibu bwonna.
In the morning he wants no one around.	Ku makya ayagala tewali muntu yenna kumpi naye.
I have the money.	Nnina ssente.
I’m so scared.	Nze ntya nnyo.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
He didn't want to talk.	Yali tayagala kwogera.
That it was so easy.	Nti kyali kyangu nnyo.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
I can only be me.	Nsobola okuba nze nzekka.
This is urgent.	Kino kya mangu.
I don’t have a good feeling about it.	Sirina mpulira nnungi ku nsonga eyo.
We will do it too.	Naffe tujja kukikola.
In a way this was a good thing.	Mu ngeri emu kino kyali kintu kirungi.
I think he's afraid more than anything.	Ndowooza atya okusinga ekintu kyonna.
We were all speechless.	Ffenna twali tetusobola kwogera.
In a sense, he will do this .	Mu ngeri emu, kino ajja kukikola .
It's not a problem at all.	Si kizibu n'akatono.
He wanted to talk to her.	Yali ayagala okwogera naye.
That would certainly be a bad thing.	Ekyo mazima ddala kyandibadde kintu kibi.
You can win or he can win.	Osobola okuwangula oba ye asobola okuwangula.
This may well be the case.	Kino kiyinza bulungi okuba nga bwe kiri.
And it’s not easy.	Era si kyangu.
And about that, there’s nothing we can do.	Era ku ekyo, tewali kye tusobola kukola.
No, that was a movie.	Nedda, eyo yali firimu.
I’m in the middle.	Nze ndi wa kati.
I will be safe with him.	Nja kuba naye nga talina bulabe.
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
I don’t have a place.	Sirina kifo.
I really needed a friend right now.	Nnali nneetaaga nnyo mukwano gwange mu kiseera kino.
I'll do better now.	Nja kukola bulungi kati.
It’s very difficult for me.	Kizibu nnyo gyendi.
He really tried.	Ddala yagezaako.
To him time doesn’t matter.	Eri ye obudde si kikulu.
That would be right.	Ekyo kyandibadde kituufu.
Not good without harm.	Si mulungi nga talina bulabe.
I do things myself.	Nze kennyini nkola ebintu.
I know you will too.	Nkimanyi naawe ojja kukikola.
It really was .	Ddala kyali .
He was nowhere to be found.	Yali talina we yali.
Must be willing to act quickly.	Alina okuba nga mwetegefu okukola mu bwangu.
You can’t make more, you can’t buy more.	Tosobola kukola bingi, tosobola kugula bingi.
It’s not going back.	Si kudda.
Not that someone else did.	Si nti omuntu omulala yakikola.
Going to say.	Okugenda okugamba.
Nothing unusual about that.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo ku ekyo.
That feels so good.	Ekyo mpulira bulungi nnyo.
But he was mine too.	Naye naye yali wange.
He really looks great.	Ddala alabika bulungi nnyo.
The problem isn’t the process.	Obuzibu si nkola.
But that’s not really at issue here.	Naye ekyo mu butuufu si kye kiri mu nsonga wano.
Australian weather today.	Obudde bwa Australia leero.
You won’t have any problems.	Tojja kuba na buzibu bwonna.
Now it is my city.	Kati kye kibuga kyange.
I love working with him.	Njagala nnyo okukola naye.
It was his car well.	Yali mmotoka ye bulungi.
There is nothing wrong with agreeing to do this.	Tewali kibi kyonna mu kukkiriza kukola kino.
It was an important moment for everyone.	Kyali kiseera kikulu eri buli muntu.
Quick, easy, and quick.	Kyangu, kyangu, era kyangu.
And you are not alone.	Era toli wekka.
Or he may not have.	Oba ayinza okuba nga talina.
That was really close.	Ekyo kyali kya kumpi ddala.
I'm with him.	Nze naye.
It’s certainly not a problem.	Mazima ddala si kizibu.
I’m sorry, really, really.	Nsonyiwa, ddala, ddala.
It might work if he was fast.	Kiyinza okukola singa yali wa bwangu.
I need a father now.	Nze nneetaaga taata kati.
Will try today.	Ajja kugezaako leero.
That would be costly for them.	Ekyo kyandibadde kya ssente nnyingi gye bali.
She really is that good.	Ddala mulungi bw’atyo.
Not everyone did it.	Si buli muntu nti yakikola.
Not much we can do.	Si bingi bye tusobola okukola.
It’s old-fashioned and ugly.	Kya dda era kibi.
He didn’t know how to do it yet.	Yali tannaba kumanya ngeri ya kukikola.
I’m on to you.	Nze ndi ku ggwe.
That would be me soon.	Oyo yandibadde nze mu bbanga ttono.
This was the moment.	Kino kye kyali akaseera.
He seems to be doing pretty well.	Alabika akola bulungi nnyo.
He wanted to be alone.	Yali ayagala kubeera yekka.
I am well aware of this.	Kino nkimanyi bulungi.
Not that we are.	Si nti tuli.
He has a younger brother.	Alina muto we.
With us it was practical, as well.	Naffe kyali kya nkola, nga.
The plan is to.	Enteekateeka eri ku...
Or in the car .	Oba mu mmotoka .
No one agreed.	Tewali yakkiriza.
But that’s not really the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri ddala.
You can’t go anywhere.	Tosobola kugenda yonna.
He is my person.	Ye muntu wange.
I should definitely go home.	Mazima ddala nsaanidde okudda eka.
It’s not a true problem.	Si kizibu kya mazima.
I can’t deal with the issue.	Sisobola kukola ku nsonga.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
He won’t be back until the evening.	Tajja kudda okutuusa akawungeezi.
This picture was important to me.	Ekifaananyi kino kyali kikulu gyendi.
I have a job.	Nnina omulimu.
We have to earn money.	Tulina okufuna ssente.
That may be true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
He was here in town.	Yali wano mu kibuga.
All the food was homemade.	Emmere yonna yali ya waka.
But he knew better than that.	Naye yali amanyi bulungi okusinga ekyo.
He was just a man.	Yali musajja yekka.
In that sense they were though.	Mu ngeri eyo baali wadde.
He knew what he wanted to say.	Yali amanyi kye yali ayagala okwogera.
He knew he couldn’t go back.	Yali akimanyi nti tasobola kudda.
On this point he has to win.	Ku nsonga eno alina okuwangula.
That he would do that.	Nti ekyo yandikoze.
I think he wanted to talk to me.	Ndowooza yali ayagala kwogera nange.
But he had no choice.	Naye yali talina kya kukola.
A little bit of it.	Katono ddala.
But he's been good about it.	Naye abadde mulungi ku nsonga eyo.
It’s not the same at all.	Si kye kimu n’akatono.
Not unless you’re very fast.	Si okuggyako nga oli wa bwangu nnyo.
You don’t have to try.	Tolina kugezaako.
And you? 	Naawe?
. . . .	.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
I couldn’t quite believe it either.	Nange nnali sisobola kukkiriza nnyo.
Not that it would matter to anyone.	Si nti kyandibadde kikulu eri omuntu yenna.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
I was scared and alone.	Nali ntya era nga ndi nzekka.
This is an important time for you.	Kino kiseera kikulu nnyo gy’oli.
I thought the food was great.	Nalowooza nti emmere nnungi nnyo.
Now he had everything.	Kati yalina buli kimu.
Early tomorrow.	Enkya nga bukyali.
This will be very, very hard work.	Kino kijja kuba kya kukola nnyo nnyo.
This is a good opportunity.	Guno mukisa mulungi.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo yakikola.
Like, really easy.	Nga, ddala kyangu.
He wants to go.	Ayagala kugenda.
For the money.	Ku ssente.
He works hard everywhere.	Akola nnyo buli wamu.
That is not true at all.	Ekyo si kituufu n’akatono.
Where are they.	Bali ludda wa.
You won’t be like us.	Tojja kuba nga ffe.
They are very vulnerable.	Bali mu bulabe nnyo.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
Thinking about it now .	Okulowooza ku nsonga eno kati .
Now you won’t come to the party.	Kati tojja kujja ku mbaga.
But he did speak.	Naye yayogera ddala.
I feel something here.	Nze waliwo kye mpulira wano.
If he had done so .	Singa yali akola bw’atyo .
It’s at the office.	Kiri ku ofiisi.
He is very happy.	Musanyufu nnyo.
He loves everyone and everything.	Ayagala buli muntu na buli kimu.
Only one has to work.	Omu yekka y’alina okukola.
He didn’t want to know who was with her.	Yali tayagala kumanya ani yali naye.
No, it’s not always the case.	Nedda, si bwe kiri bulijjo.
Everything, everything on time.	Buli kimu, buli kimu mu budde.
Reading is important.	Okusoma kikulu.
He was just busy.	Yali bbize yekka.
Not in the house.	Si mu nnyumba.
You’re so scared.	Otya nnyo.
No such luck this past week.	Tewali mukisa nga guno wiiki eno ewedde.
And I think that’s a good thing.	Era ndowooza nti ekyo kintu kirungi.
I’m really desperate.	Nze ddala nfunye essuubi.
Here, we have nothing of the sort.	Wano, tetulina kintu kyonna kya ngeri eyo.
I couldn’t say anything.	Nnali sisobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
And there is the case.	Era waliwo bwe kiri.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
He felt comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi.
His friend asked how it was.	Mukwano gwe yabuuza bwe kyali.
And this is it, you know.	Era kino kye kiri, omanyi.
What he looked happy about.	Kye yali alabika nga musanyufu.
It’s the eyes.	Ye maaso.
However, I have no idea.	Kyokka sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
This is who we are and what we are.	Kino kye tuli era kye tuli.
In that sense, we were the same.	Mu ngeri eyo, twali kye kimu.
In .	Mu .
He had already seen it.	Yali yalaba dda.
No one is talking about it.	Tewali ayogera ku nsonga eyo.
He didn’t have to do this.	Kino yali talina kukikola.
I feel pretty good about it.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo ku nsonga eno.
He wasn’t coming.	Yali tajja.
He had no bottom.	Yali talina wansi.
He doesn't know any children.	Tamanyi mwana yenna.
And my wife.	Ne mukyala wange.
One can only work in the present.	Omuntu asobola okukola mu kiseera kino kyokka.
Everyone knew why.	Buli omu yali amanyi lwaki.
I guess he knew that.	Ntebereza nti ekyo yali akimanyi.
He won’t try again.	Tajja kuddamu kugezaako.
Home all morning.	Awaka enkya yonna.
At that time	Mu kiseera ekyo .
You probably already know that.	Ekyo osanga okimanyi dda.
I didn’t know any of this until now.	Nnali simanyi kintu kyonna ku bino okutuusa kati.
That's a bad thing.	Ekyo kibi.
Nothing is right.	Tewali kintu kyonna kituufu.
That’s not what we have here.	Ekyo si kye tulina wano.
It can only be one thing, but it is something.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu kimu kyokka, naye kintu.
I want it for my wife.	Njagala ku lwa mukyala wange.
He was happy.	Yali musanyufu.
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
It was a very serious situation.	Yali mbeera ya maanyi nnyo.
And well he might be.	Era bulungi ayinza okuba.
He didn’t have time, he didn’t want to know.	Yali talina budde, yali tayagala kumanya.
Approximately...	Okutuuka ku...
Everyone knew what they were.	Buli omu yali amanyi kye bali.
Of course, we all have to work.	Kya lwatu nti ffenna tulina okukola.
He admitted that was true.	Yakkiriza nti ekyo kyali kituufu.
I can do anything.	Nsobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
I don’t think that’s good.	Ndowooza ekyo si kirungi.
He seems like a nice guy.	Alabika nga ggaayi omulungi.
He almost lived on her.	Kumpi yali abeera ku ye.
I am a woman.	Nze ndi mukyala.
But he'll probably be asleep now.	Naye osanga kati ajja kuba yeebase.
That was normal.	Ekyo kyali kya bulijjo.
Maybe he was asleep.	Mpozzi yali yeebase.
You may know that by now.	Ekyo oyinza okuba nga okimanyi mu kiseera kino.
And he had this issue.	Era yalina ensonga eno.
I would love to talk to you.	Njagala nnyo okwogera naawe.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kintu kibi.
Only he is still alone.	Yekka akyali yekka.
And it’s still there.	Era n’okutuusa kati.
That’s what he has to answer.	Ekyo ky’alina okuddamu.
He went to the movies.	Yagenda mu firimu.
He said he had to go.	Yagambye nti alina okugenda.
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
But there is a problem.	Naye waliwo ekizibu.
He told me you would come here.	Yangamba nti ojja kujja wano.
And he would be here .	Era yandibadde wano .
And perhaps this is true today.	Era oboolyawo kino kituufu leero.
And that you were ready.	Era nti wali mwetegefu.
I may have been one.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnali omu.
I'll have to talk to him about it.	Nja kuba nnina okwogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
Everything was much easier then.	Buli kimu kyali kyangu nnyo mu kiseera ekyo.
It’s for everyone.	Kya buli muntu.
And I'm the one.	Era nze.
I'll come alone.	Nja kujja nzekka.
I was happy to work with him too.	Nange nnali musanyufu okukola naye.
She is a lovely, lovely woman.	Ye mukyala ayagala ennyo, ayagala ennyo.
I love being here.	Njagala nnyo okubeera wano.
It was very powerful.	Yali ya maanyi nnyo.
But it’s true.	Naye kituufu.
I don’t want anyone to know.	Saagala muntu yenna kumanya.
I was a young child.	Nnali mwana muto.
It won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo.
That was a terrible thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi nnyo.
All he can see is her.	Kye asobola okulaba ye.
But there isn’t.	Naye tewali.
Although there is hope.	Wadde nga waliwo essuubi.
I know you don’t really want to do it.	Nkimanyi nti mu butuufu toyagala kukikola.
You'll be.	Ggwe ojja ku...
I won’t know for sure.	Sijja kumanya bulungi.
He says he doesn’t like my opinion.	Agamba nti tayagala ndowooza yange.
I don’t want him to hit anything.	Saagala akuba kintu kyonna.
For both of them.	Ku bombi.
We certainly are.	Mazima ddala tuli.
That’s what it was here.	Ekyo kye kyali wano.
I could have left here.	Nnali nsobola okuva wano.
True, it is not.	Kituufu, si bwe kiri.
And only you can truly think about that person every day.	Era ggwe wekka asobola okulowooza ku muntu oyo mu butuufu buli lunaku.
It was a real disaster.	Kyali kizibu kya ddala.
I still have no idea who he was.	Nze n’okutuusa kati sirina kye mmanyi nti yali ani.
He was like, no really.	Yali nga, nedda ddala.
Just being in this room.	Okubeera mu kisenge kino kyokka.
This is completely normal.	Kino kya bulijjo ddala.
However, this is not the problem.	Kyokka kino si kye kizibu.
I can’t, anyway.	Sisobola, mu ngeri yonna.
He didn't know what to do.	Yali tamanyi kye yali alina kukola.
Young man.	Muto.
It was mine, good.	Kyali kyange, kirungi.
Tom certainly isn’t.	Tom mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
Nothing was real.	Tewali kyali kya ddala.
That was always his problem.	Ekyo bulijjo kye kyali ekizibu kye.
He looked strong, but not too fast.	Yalabika nga wa maanyi, naye nga si wa bwangu nnyo.
He was friendly, she thought.	Yali wa mukwano, bwe yalowooza.
It will be true.	Kijja kuba kituufu.
It will work just fine.	Kijja kukola bulungi nnyo.
No, you know that.	Nedda, ekyo okimanyi.
In ourselves alone.	Mu ffe ffekka.
He went away.	Yagenda.
I think he is dangerous right now.	Ndowooza mu kiseera kino wa bulabe.
Now or nothing.	Kati oba tewali.
But there was a chance.	Naye nga waliwo omukisa.
I’m sure everything will be fine.	Nkakasa nti buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi.
Apparently, well .	Kirabika, bulungi .
You can do that.	Osobola okukola ekyo.
He was really just a schoolteacher.	Mu butuufu yali musomesa wa ssomero yekka.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
This was excellent.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
We all need to be in this together.	Ffenna twetaaga okubeera mu kino nga tuli wamu.
That was a blessing.	Ekyo kyali kya mukisa.
I am a poet.	Ndi muyimbi.
It’s not always easy.	Si kyangu bulijjo.
Everything looks great.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He may be too close now.	Ayinza okuba nga ali kumpi nnyo kati.
He wants a friend.	Ayagala mukwano.
He is a poet.	Ye muyimbi.
It’s easy to say.	Kyangu okwogera.
You will make a lot of money that way too.	Naawe ojja kukola ssente nnyingi mu ngeri eyo.
My father was at home.	Taata yali waka.
I don’t have one.	Sirina emu.
I’m in a hurry.	Nze ndi mu bwangu nnyo.
Being human .	Okubeera omuntu .
It is both real and unreal.	Kya ddala era si kya ddala.
I wasn’t a human being.	Nze nali siri muntu.
And herein lies the problem.	Era wano we wali ekizibu.
He seems to be doing a lot.	Alabika akola bingi.
He was the only one he knew.	Ye yekka gwe yali amanyi.
He had to do it.	Yali alina okukikola.
This is both good and bad.	Kino kirungi era kibi.
I was nowhere to be found.	Nnali sirina we nnali nfunye.
But that’s the problem.	Naye ekyo kye kizibu.
Maybe he’s still there.	Mpozzi akyali eyo.
He did the thing he did.	Yakola ekintu kye yakola.
That’s a lot of money, in a way.	Ekyo ssente nnyingi, mu ngeri emu.
However, this seems simple.	Kyokka, kino kirabika nga kyangu.
I just wonder about that.	Nze ekyo kyokka kye nneebuuza.
It’s not about winning.	Si kya kuwangula.
He didn’t think it mattered.	Yali talowooza nti kyali kikulu.
However, there is one problem.	Kyokka, waliwo ekizibu kimu.
He was here.	Yali wano.
I don’t really like it.	Sikyagala nnyo.
Of course, he had plenty of money at his disposal.	Kya lwatu nti yalina ssente nnyingi ze yalina.
I'm afraid.	Nze ntya.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
He is still in the works.	Akyali mu kukola.
I thought he was pretty good.	Nalowooza nti yali mulungi nnyo.
But, we can do better.	Naye, tusobola okukola obulungi.
This would be a bad thing.	Kino kyandibadde kintu kibi.
And she looked good too.	Era naye yalabika bulungi.
Good luck to everyone!.	Omukisa omulungi eri buli muntu!.
He had no idea where it was.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna gye kyali.
He's just a kid.	Ye mwana muto yekka.
I know it won’t be the same.	Nkimanyi nti tekijja kuba kye kimu.
He certainly had no plans for anyone.	Mazima ddala yali talina nteekateeka ya muntu yenna.
It’s certainly not too complicated.	Mazima ddala si kizibu nnyo.
But three it was.	Naye ssatu bwe kyali.
Maybe it’s as simple as that.	Mpozzi nga kyangu nga ekyo.
He won’t even talk.	Tajja kwogera wadde.
Only one so far.	Omu yekka n’okutuusa kati.
I guess we’ll do well here.	Ntebereza nti wano tujja kukola bulungi.
But he was very young.	Naye nga muto nnyo.
Now he wants to talk to both of us.	Kati ayagala okwogera naffe ffembi.
I could do this right now.	Kino nnali nsobola okukikola mu kiseera kino.
However, that may just be me.	Kyokka, ekyo kiyinza okuba nga nze nzekka.
I am afraid all the time.	Ntya buli kiseera.
There was plenty of food.	Emmere yali nnyingi.
That wasn’t the case.	Ekyo nga si bwe kyali.
I said he wouldn’t.	Nagamba nti tajja kukikola.
It is a full-time position.	Kifo kya kiseera kyonna.
No one knows what this is.	Kino kye kiri tewali akimanyi.
But it was more complicated than that.	Naye kyali kizibu okusinga ekyo.
It will definitely happen.	Mazima ddala kijja kubaawo.
He is the power.	Ye maanyi.
He wanted to go anywhere.	Yali ayagala kugenda mu kifo kyonna.
But you’re lucky, there.	Naye oli wa mukisa, awo.
We'll wait.	Tujja kulinda.
What he did in there .	Kye yakola mu eyo .
Today he does the same.	Leero naye akola kye kimu.
It was actually quite difficult.	Mu butuufu kyali kizibu nnyo.
It’s not love.	Si kwagala.
It was my turn to study.	Yali kiseera kyange okusoma.
He knew he wouldn't.	Yali akimanyi nti tajja kukikola.
You are with you	Oli naawe .
However, the job is not for everyone.	Kyokka omulimu si gwa buli muntu.
Like that in a man.	Nga ekyo mu musajja.
It’s not the time.	Si kye kiseera.
But he wasn’t.	Naye ye si bwe yali.
I’m fine with it.	Nze ndi bulungi.
And maybe you will.	Era mpozzi ojja kukikola.
You can’t do that here.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola wano.
That’s really important.	Ekyo ddala kikulu nnyo.
No one can say for how long.	Tewali ayinza kwogera okumala bbanga ki.
And that can be a problem.	Era ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
I will be there next week.	Nja kubeerawo wiiki ejja.
I want to go too.	Nange njagala kugenda.
I would like to say that .	Njagala okugamba nti .
And a true friend.	Era mukwano gwa ddala.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
We can eat.	Tusobola okulya.
But are we?.	Naye ffe tuli?.
I am practical.	Nze ndi wa nkola.
So far, I hope.	Okutuuka kati, nsuubira.
And that is the core of the problem.	Era ekyo kye kikulu ekizibu.
But he was fine.	Naye yali bulungi.
He always had to work.	Bulijjo yalina okukola.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
And that’s all.	Era ekyo kyokka.
I'm going quickly.	Ngenda mangu.
But he might have been on to something.	Naye yandiba nga yali ku kintu.
Or early in the morning.	Oba ku makya ennyo.
I definitely need to do the same.	Mazima ddala nange nneetaaga okukola kye kimu.
Even to me.	Wadde eri nze.
He didn’t seem interested in money or issues.	Yalabika nga tayagala ssente wadde ensonga.
Or next weekend.	Oba wiikendi ejja.
However, that is not really a good answer.	Kyokka, mu butuufu ekyo si kya kuddamu kirungi.
That’s good to eat.	Ekyo kirungi okulya.
He was enough, of everything.	Yali amaze, ku buli kimu.
Everyone knew it.	Buli omu yali akimanyi.
Right, you said .	Kituufu, wagamba nti .
This will not be easy.	Kino tekijja kuba kyangu.
And it’s not an answer.	Era si kuddamu.
But this is not to be.	Naye kino si kya kubeera.
I could just do it.	Nnali nsobola okukikola kyokka.
One down, one to go.	Omu wansi, omu okugenda.
How important it is.	Nga kikulu nnyo.
Or this	Oba kino .
It would be very difficult to think too far ahead.	Kyandibadde kizibu nnyo okulowooza ennyo mu maaso.
You said it wouldn’t happen.	Wagamba nti tekijja kubaawo.
But that was fine with me.	Naye ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
There is something here.	Waliwo ekintu wano.
I wanted to tell someone about it.	Nnali njagala okubuulira omuntu ku nsonga eno.
He will do it.	Ajja kukikola.
This watch will help.	Essaawa eno ejja kuyamba.
I am strong and fast.	Ndi wa maanyi era ndi wa bwangu.
He had to leave this place.	Yalina okuva mu kifo kino.
He was a father.	Yali taata.
It’s hard for me to say.	Kizibu gyendi okwogera.
He does everything in His time.	Buli kimu akikola mu kiseera kye.
I have him.	Nze nnina ye.
I could go home.	Nnali nsobola okudda eka.
No one could buy anything anyway.	Tewali yali asobola kugula kintu kyonna mu ngeri yonna.
But no one could live here.	Naye tewali yali asobola kubeera wano.
Nothing bad can happen.	Tewali kibi kiyinza kubaawo.
I don’t like it.	Sikyagala.
Here, he knew he would be talking to himself.	Wano, yali akimanyi nti ajja kuba ayogera naye yekka.
It was so fast, so hard.	Kyali kya mangu nnyo, nga kizibu nnyo.
I know everything in here.	Nze buli kimu nkimanyi mu wano.
it is very true indeed.	kituufu nnyo ddala.
I was all in for it.	Nze byonna nali mu.
But we can do it.	Naye tusobola okukikola.
He was in prison.	Yali mu kkomera.
He wouldn't tell the doctor about it.	Yali tagenda kubuulira musawo ku nsonga eyo.
I am a poet.	Ndi muyimbi.
He always would have done.	Bulijjo yandikoze.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera.
Being his friend, and all.	Okubeera mukwano gwe, ne byonna.
He has the power.	Alina amaanyi.
You know exactly why he's here.	Omanyi bulungi lwaki ali wano.
Maybe this is going to work out.	Mpozzi kino kigenda kukola bulungi.
But that’s the thing.	Naye ekyo kye kintu.
He is now a doctor.	Kati ye musawo.
There    .	Awo .
Either way, it’s really quite simple.	Mu ngeri yonna, ddala kyangu nnyo.
We cannot accept this fact.	Ensonga eno tetusobola kukkiriza.
You will see that .	Ojja kulaba nti .
They certainly are.	Mazima ddala bwe bali.
And it was close.	Era kyali kumpi.
Or not much.	Oba si bingi.
However, it is true.	Kyokka, kituufu.
He may have already done this.	Kino ayinza okuba nga yakikola dda.
And then no.	Era awo nedda.
I want someone.	Njagala omuntu.
It’s not what he did.	Si kye yakola.
The only thing is.	Ekintu kyokka kiri nti.
Just not doing anything.	Obutakola kintu kyonna kyokka.
But not without hard work.	Naye si nga tewali kukola nnyo.
Hope is not a party.	Essuubi si mbaga.
I'll be fine.	Nja kuba bulungi.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
He could do that for a very long time.	Ekyo yali asobola okukikola okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
We'll talk here.	Tujja kwogera wano.
Nor anything like this.	Wadde ekintu kyonna nga kino.
I don’t know a man.	Simanyi musajja.
You are really in him.	Ddala oli mu ye.
I think he's fine.	Ndowooza ali bulungi.
It’s not like that though.	Si bwe kiri wadde.
Attitude is very important.	Endowooza kikulu nnyo.
What he did was wrong.	Kye yakola kyali kibi.
I think we’ll be fine.	Ndowooza tujja kuba bulungi.
And that guy.	Ne ggaayi oyo.
We don’t have any time.	Tetulina budde bwonna.
I was an ordinary child.	Nze nali mwana wa bulijjo.
No one should know that he was not the father.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kumanya nti si ye yali taata.
Now I don’t want to.	Kati saagala.
He went to prison.	Yagenda mu kkomera.
If only no one did.	Singa tewali muntu yenna yakola bw’atyo.
But we have almost nothing.	Naye kumpi tetulina kye tulina.
That’s normal.	Ekyo nga kya bulijjo.
I am happy to go back.	Ndi musanyufu okudda emabega.
He was completely alone.	Yali yekka ddala.
He should have done it a lot.	Yandibadde akikola nnyo.
And probably with him, too.	Era oboolyawo naye, naye.
Not that he had much.	Si nti yalina bingi.
It was always an issue.	Bulijjo yali nsonga.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
That one looks good.	Oyo alabika bulungi.
I want to be with him.	Njagala kubeera wamu naye.
I know that’s not true.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo si kituufu.
This was not the case with me.	Kino si bwe kyali ku nze.
He's not going to do it, he thought.	Tagenda kukikola, bwe yalowooza.
I didn’t know what to expect or fear.	Nnali simanyi kye nnali nsuubira oba kye nnali ntya.
I needed to go home.	Nnali nneetaaga okudda eka.
I was as young as you.	Nze nali muto nga ggwe.
But no one knew.	Naye tewali yali amanyi.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si kye kituufu.
You’re the only one.	Ggwe wekka.
It comes in many forms.	Kijja mu ngeri nnyingi.
I’m my brother.	Nze muganda wange.
It seems to be in really good shape.	Kirabika kiri mu mbeera nnungi ddala.
No one is talking to me here.	Tewali ayogera nange wano.
We’re going to be back.	Tugenda kuddamu.
But it is something we can all do.	Naye kye kintu ffenna kye tusobola okukola.
That’s really .	Ekyo ddala .
He needed to know that.	Ekyo yali yeetaaga okumanya.
He was probably from this city.	Oboolyawo yali wa mu kibuga kino.
Here he was now.	Wano we yali kati.
Tonight doesn’t matter.	Ekiro kya leero si kikulu.
I can get that.	Ekyo nsobola okufuna.
It might be three.	Kiyinza okuba nga ssatu.
I am happy.	Ndi musanyufu.
I'm not mine.	Siri wange.
He is a real man.	Ye musajja ddala.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
Here, there isn’t.	Wano, tewali.
But I can’t go on.	Naye sisobola kugenda mu maaso.
It was a lucky moment.	Kyali kiseera kya mukisa.
We are everything.	Ffe tuli buli kimu.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
Why would he do that?.	Lwaki yandikoze ekyo?.
You need to get the book.	Olina okufuna ekitabo.
We’ll go together.	Tujja kugenda ffenna.
You are here with me.	Oli wano nange.
But it’s not just my time.	Naye si kye kiseera kyange kyokka.
No, he can work.	Nedda asobola kukola.
It may well be the case.	Kiyinza bulungi okuba nga bwe kiri.
This is a simple and easy thing to do.	Kino kintu kyangu era kyangu okukola.
That’s just true.	Ekyo kituufu kyokka.
If only he knew.	Singa yali amanyi.
I know you love to read.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala nnyo okusoma.
He is not in a good place.	Tali mu kifo kirungi.
He doesn’t know yet.	Tannaba kumanya.
We are, of course.	Ffe tuli, ddala.
Now I feel like he really did.	Kati mpulira nga bwe yakola ddala.
He didn’t want to talk much.	Yali tayagala kwogera nnyo.
We are moving forward.	Tugenda mu maaso.
I’ve got a job.	Nfunye omulimu.
This is a lot of money.	Eno ssente nnyingi nnyo.
But really, it’s better not.	Naye ddala, kirungi si bwe kiri.
But that wasn’t all they were.	Naye ekyo si kye kyokka kye baali.
I'm not sure which one yet.	Sikakasa ki n'okutuusa kati.
Now is the time to act.	Kati kye kiseera okukola.
And that’s fine and true.	Era ekyo kirungi era kituufu.
Maybe very soon.	Mpozzi mu bbanga ttono ddala.
And this is exactly the same.	Era kino kye kimu ddala.
We will all do it.	Ffenna tujja kukikola.
I won’t even believe anything.	Sijja na kukkiriza kintu kyonna.
It is also a place of the city.	Era kifo kya kibuga.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
I have to go.	Nnina okugenda.
No, no, that you don’t.	Nedda, nedda, nti ggwe tolina.
Like, always.	Nga, bulijjo.
However, this is not true at all.	Kyokka, kino si kituufu n’akatono.
It is a very powerful thing.	Kintu kya maanyi nnyo.
Of course, he lived alone.	Kya lwatu nti yali abeera yekka.
This is a very important group.	Kino kibiina kikulu nnyo.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
But he wasn’t the man he was.	Naye si ye musajja gwe yali.
For each of these.	Ku buli kimu ku bino.
He was always home, we were always together.	Bulijjo yali waka, bulijjo twali ffembi.
The dinner was good.	Ekyeggulo kyali kirungi.
I was alone, as usual.	Nali nzekka, nga bulijjo.
It was really early in the morning.	Ddala kyali kya makya nnyo.
He didn't want a child to be afraid.	Yali tayagala mwana atya.
He is not very well.	Tali bulungi nnyo.
This can be very awkward at a party.	Kino kiyinza okubeera ekizibu ennyo ku kabaga.
I am not in a position to speak.	Siri mu mbeera ya kwogera.
He doesn’t have a car.	Talina mmotoka.
He was nowhere to be found.	Yali talina we yali.
I’m sorry, you can’t have this one.	Nsonyiwa, tosobola kuba na eno.
I don’t think it will happen.	Sirowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
Underneath it all is a picture.	Wansi wa byonna waliwo ekifaananyi.
He must have expected trouble.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali asuubira obuzibu.
He said he was sick.	Yagambye nti mulwadde.
No one should do any of this.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kukola kintu kyonna ku bino.
He was the one who loved it.	Ye yali ayagala ennyo.
However, this is a bad idea.	Kyokka, kino kirowoozo kibi.
I hope that’s true.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kituufu.
I am very curious.	Njagala nnyo okumanya.
You always have.	Bulijjo olina.
No one knows it’s there but me.	Tewali amanyi nti kiri awo okuggyako nze.
How to deal with winning.	Engeri y’okukola ku kuwangula.
And nobody said anything.	Era tewali yayogera kintu kyonna.
Winning is the only thing.	Okuwangula kye kintu kyokka.
For that matter, no one knows.	Ku nsonga eyo, tewali muntu yenna amanyi.
That was what he had to say.	Ekyo kye yali alina okwogera.
But he does it.	Naye akikola.
You are my friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange.
I thought you should know.	Nalowooza nti olina okumanya.
The beautiful one.	Omulungi.
Maybe he did too.	Mpozzi naye yakikola.
Surely that was the whole point.	Mazima ddala eyo ye yali ensonga yonna.
He said that	Yagambye nti .
And he is in trouble.	Era ali mu buzibu.
That’s in the planning.	Ekyo kiri mu nteekateeka.
Everything is the same thing.	Buli kintu kimu.
He expected what he got.	Yali asuubira bye yafuna.
I couldn’t even talk much.	Nnali sisobola na kwogera nnyo.
He didn’t want to know.	Yali tayagala kumanya.
He said to call anytime.	Yagambye okukuba essimu essaawa yonna.
There is absolutely nothing to do in the city.	Tewali n’akatono kya kukola mu kibuga.
You will be here in the house with me.	Ojja kubeera wano mu nnyumba nange.
Not that he has been working.	Si nti abadde akola.
But there was no reason.	Naye nga tewali nsonga yonna.
I will not allow it to happen.	Sijja kukkiriza kubaawo.
But that’s a practice.	Naye eyo nkola.
It was so close.	Yali kumpi nnyo.
I work from home.	Nkola nga ndi waka.
But he knew it wasn’t.	Naye yali akimanyi nti si bwe kiri.
I want to know who knew.	Njagala okumanya ani yali amanyi.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
. . . .	.
Maybe he does now.	Mpozzi kati akikola.
It’s going to happen, too.	Kigenda kubaawo, era.
I could think again.	Nnali nsobola okuddamu okulowooza.
They are in danger.	Bali mu bulabe.
It is very real and very powerful.	Kya ddala nnyo era kya maanyi nnyo.
Despite this alone.	Wadde kino kyokka.
No one is talking to him.	Tewali ayogera naye.
He loves us all.	Ayagala ffenna.
He thought back to when he had been happy.	Yalowooza ku kiseera we yali abadde musanyufu.
He said he was going to win.	Yagambye nti agenda kuwangula.
But he was done.	Naye yali amaze.
In fact, it will probably continue by then.	Mu butuufu, osanga kijja kugenda mu maaso mu kiseera ekyo.
She was very beautiful.	Yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
Now he needed to know why.	Kati yali yeetaaga okumanya ensonga lwaki.
I’m sure he will.	Nkakasa nti ajja kukikola.
No, he was an ordinary man.	Nedda, yali musajja wa bulijjo.
He has it all.	Byonna y’alina.
You’ll be fine tomorrow.	Ojja kuba bulungi enkya.
I was very young.	Nnali muto nnyo.
I was a little nervous in the morning.	Nali ntya katono ku makya.
But in this case, there is no issue.	Naye mu mbeera eno, tewali nsonga.
Actually, because that.	Mu butuufu, kuba ekyo.
But he's the guy.	Naye ye ggaayi.
I wish I could get back to that.	Njagala nnyo okudda mu mbeera eyo.
He actually knew someone.	Mu butuufu yali amanyi omuntu.
My point was, we are one.	Ensonga yange yali nti, ffe tuli kimu.
There! 	Awo!
there! 	awo!
He is mine now.	Ye wange kati.
But you know that.	Naye ekyo okimanyi.
I hear about this.	Mpulira ku kino.
No one can do this.	Kino tewali asobola kukikola.
I honestly have no idea.	Mu butuufu sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
No one wants to.	Tewali ayagala.
This is definitely not the case.	Kino ddala si bwe kiri.
He knew he had to win.	Yali akimanyi nti alina okuwangula.
. . . .	.
And, at the same time, that’s too bad.	Era, mu kiseera kye kimu, ekyo kibi nnyo.
I know he will do it.	Nkimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
However, she was very handsome.	Kyokka yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
Down you go.	Wansi ggwe ogenda.
It’s actually hard to see how.	Mu butuufu kizibu okulaba engeri gye kiri.
He did it, almost every day.	Yakikola, kumpi buli lunaku.
We are winning.	Tuli mu kuwangula.
That's why he wanted to talk to you.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki yali ayagala okwogera naawe.
He needs money urgently .	Yeetaaga ssente mu bwangu .
I just want to spend time with you.	Njagala kumala naawe kyokka.
I didn’t know the answer.	Nnali simanyi kya kuddamu.
I'll come to.	Nja kujja ku.
I was on everyone.	Nali ku buli muntu.
But it was real.	Naye nga kyali kya ddala.
No, he shouldn’t.	Nedda, tasaanidde.
That's what he says.	Ekyo ayogera.
I am this room.	Nze kye kisenge kino.
I am nothing.	Nze siri kintu kyonna.
It seems to be true .	Kirabika nga kituufu .
My wife is the one.	Mukyala wange ye.
However, no one seems to have done so.	Kyokka kirabika tewali yakikola.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
He was always very interested.	Bulijjo yali ayagala nnyo.
It’s true, of course.	Kituufu, ddala.
He wasn’t just a nice guy.	Yali si musajja mulungi kyokka.
He seems to be doing well.	Alabika akola bulungi.
And really strong.	Era ddala nga wa maanyi.
Indeed, it was difficult.	Mazima ddala, kyali kizibu.
But there is a problem with this.	Naye waliwo obuzibu mu nsonga eno.
And it may be that.	Era kiyinza okuba nga.
We cannot accept this view.	Tetusobola kukkiriza ndowooza eno.
Or who exactly did what.	Oba ani ddala yakola ki.
He is just sick.	Ali mulwadde yekka.
He can say what he wants.	Asobola okwogera ky’ayagala.
He could not believe this.	Kino yali tasobola kukkiriza.
But he will be soon.	Naye ajja kuba mu bbanga ttono.
However, it is not him.	Kyokka si ye.
In fact, he was much more ordinary than he thought.	Mu butuufu, yali wa bulijjo nnyo okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
And he looked good.	Era yalabika bulungi.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
There was no way he could do it.	Tewali ngeri yonna gye yali asobola kukikola.
I know he isn’t, not really.	Nkimanyi nti si bw’atyo, si ddala.
But you’re home now, with us.	Naye oli waka kati, naffe.
And there is.	Era waliwo.
It is absolutely true.	Kituufu ddala.
We cannot know why.	Tetusobola kumanya nsonga lwaki.
Perhaps it is.	Oboolyawo bwe kiri.
It’s bad, it’s bad, it’s awful.	Kibi, kibi, kibi nnyo.
He tried to talk but couldn't.	Yagezaako okwogera naye nga tasobola.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
It’s what we all can and should do.	Kye ffenna kye tusobola era kye tulina okukola.
Everything is in place.	Buli kimu kiri mu kifo.
and it seems to have been.	era kirabika bwe kyali.
I’m sure there is one.	Nkakasa nti waliwo emu.
That’s what he was.	Ekyo kye yali.
No one has to know.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kumanya.
It was exactly the same.	Kyali kye kimu ddala.
It’s really quite simple.	Ddala kyangu nnyo.
I don’t know about that.	Simanyi ku nsonga eyo.
We have no problem with that.	Ekyo tetulina buzibu bwonna.
You are very happy.	Oli musanyufu nnyo.
I don’t want to wait.	Nze saagala kulinda.
Here is one way.	Wano waliwo engeri emu.
You can't .	Tosobola .
I think we need to do this now.	Ndowooza kino twetaaga okukikola kati.
And in that.	Era mu ekyo.
He needed time to think.	Yali yeetaaga obudde okulowooza.
He was, too, a man.	Yali ye, naye, musajja.
No, that is not the case.	Nedda, ekyo si bwe kiri.
This was my office.	Eno ye yali ofiisi yange.
Although we .	Wadde nga ffe .
I hope here from you soon.	Nsuubira wano okuva gyoli mu bbanga ttono.
He will be home tomorrow.	Ajja kubeera waka enkya.
It’s not good at all.	Si kirungi n’akatono.
You are a good person.	Oli muntu mulungi.
Everything is for everyone.	Buli kimu kya buli muntu.
You will have to work hard.	Ojja kuba olina okukola ennyo.
Or early in the morning.	Oba ku makya ennyo.
Anything you want.	Ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
He felt comfortable with her.	Yawulira bulungi naye.
Everything seems to have gone.	Buli kimu kirabika nga bwe yagenda.
I need a car.	Nze nneetaaga mmotoka.
He doesn’t know when but he knows it will happen.	Tamanyi ddi naye akimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
It was anything but.	Kyali kintu kyonna naye.
From the here and now.	Okuva ku wano ne kati.
But he looks good so far.	Naye alabika bulungi okutuusa kati.
But you know what.	Naye ggwe omanyi kiki.
He is like a father to us.	Ali nga taata gye tuli.
That’s not a bad thing for me.	Ekyo si kibi gyendi.
I am only one man.	Nze ndi musajja omu yekka.
Obviously the same thing.	Kya lwatu nti ekintu kye kimu.
However, there is hope.	Kyokka, waliwo essuubi.
Not even in this way.	Si wadde mu ngeri eno.
We all needed it.	Ffenna twali twetaaga.
However, he did not know the truth about himself.	Kyokka, yali tamanyi kituufu ku ye.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
Not nearly as good.	Si kumpi nga kirungi.
There is no help for you.	Tewali buyambi bwonna gy’oli.
You can definitely go.	Mazima ddala osobola okugenda.
There is one police station in the city.	Mu kibuga mulimu poliisi emu.
He was probably already asleep.	Oboolyawo yali yeebase dda.
I have to get everything just right.	Nnina okufuna buli kimu nga kituufu.
Why couldn’t he be mine.	Lwaki yali tasobola kuba wange.
Not alone, by any means.	Si yekka, mu ngeri yonna.
That is why we are here.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
Obviously, you are not.	Kya lwatu nti ggwe si bwe kiri.
He was eager to move on.	Yali ayagala nnyo okugenda mu maaso.
I know why.	Nkimanyi lwaki.
He hasn’t done it yet.	Tannaba kukikola.
However, you were lucky.	Kyokka wali wa mukisa.
There is nothing simple about it.	Tewali kintu kyangu ku nsonga eyo.
It was ordinary.	Kyali kya bulijjo.
From this we proceed as usual.	Okuva ku kino tugenda mu maaso nga bulijjo.
And he didn't want one, either.	Era naye yali tayagala emu, era.
At my place, as usual.	Ku kifo kyange, nga bulijjo.
He will eat well.	Ajja kulya bulungi.
He is stronger than you.	Asinga ggwe amaanyi.
It’s a powerful thing.	Kintu kya maanyi.
That’s not me being unsure.	Ekyo si nze okubeera nga sikakasa.
But there is that issue.	Naye waliwo ensonga eyo.
I have no need for one.	Sirina kye nneetaaga ku kimu.
We have to win.	Tulina okuwangula.
I really hope everything works out.	Nsuubira ddala nti buli kimu kigenda bulungi.
You can work here.	Osobola okukola wano.
He wanted to know who it was.	Yali ayagala okumanya ani.
It seems to be a good one.	Kirabika nga kirungi.
This wasn’t that.	Kino si kye kyali ekyo.
And maybe that was a good thing.	Era mpozzi ekyo kyali kintu kirungi.
But he does do so.	Naye akola bw’atyo.
This is really good.	Kino kirungi ddala.
Not too much of it.	Si bingi nnyo.
Everything he said was true.	Buli kye yayogera kyali kituufu.
He couldn’t believe his luck.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza mukisa gwe.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
No one truly knows what’s going to happen.	Tewali amanyi mu butuufu ekigenda okubaawo.
It would be what he wanted.	Kyandibadde kye yali ayagala.
I could live here.	Nnali nsobola okubeera wano.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
He is not here right now.	Tali wano mu kiseera kino.
Now we can drive.	Kati tusobola okuvuga.
I loved all of those things.	Ebintu ebyo byonna nnali njagala nnyo.
I can say the same about filmmaking.	Nze nsobola okwogera ekintu kye kimu ku kukola firimu.
This is a very serious job.	Omulimu guno gwa maanyi nnyo.
I need to eat.	Nze nneetaaga okulya.
We probably should.	Oboolyawo tusaanidde okukola.
I can absolutely.	Nsobola ddala.
He won’t come at you.	Tajja kujja ku ggwe.
It wasn’t like that though.	Si bwe kyali wadde.
Everything here is mine.	Buli kimu wano kyange.
Here, he just couldn't tell.	Wano, yali tasobola kumanya kyokka.
He wanted me to feel.	Yali ayagala mpulira.
He knows the dog.	Amanyi embwa.
Not exactly the case.	Si bwe kiri ddala.
Here all the time.	Wano obudde bwonna.
He knew he was in trouble.	Yali akimanyi nti ali mu buzibu.
Not like they were.	Si nga bwe baali.
But soon, it won’t matter.	Naye mu bbanga ttono, tekijja kuba kikulu.
And you are	Era oli .
He didn’t think he was better than anyone else.	Yali talowooza nti asinga omuntu omulala yenna.
It’s a man’s issue.	Ensonga ya musajja.
And not just any man.	Era si musajja yenna yekka.
No, my friend.	Nedda mukwano gwange.
And he is alone.	Era ali yekka.
I was feeling scared.	Nali mpulira nga ntya.
He can’t see.	Tasobola kulaba.
I’m not a father.	Nze siri taata.
You and you.	Ggwe naawe.
I'll stay here.	Nja kusigala wano.
There was no money he could earn.	Tewali ssente ze yali asobola kufuna.
I know he’s in trouble.	Nkimanyi nti ali mu buzibu.
There is no time for that.	Ekyo tewali budde.
That’s pretty cool, man.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo musajja.
And everything is so simple.	Era buli kimu kyangu nnyo.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
I think this is very true.	Ndowooza kino kituufu nnyo.
He must have known at the time.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali akimanyi mu kiseera ekyo.
No, more than that.	Nedda, okusinga ekyo.
Not in this case.	Si mu mbeera eno.
It's not true for another, but it's true for you.	Si kituufu eri omulala, naye kituufu gy'oli.
But he can’t be there.	Naye tasobola kubeerawo.
I love stuff like this.	Njagala nnyo ebintu nga bino.
He had always been here.	Bulijjo yali abadde wano.
You can either do it or you can’t.	Osobola okukikola oba tosobola.
We have to have this.	Tulina okuba na kino.
And not with him.	Era si naye.
This is a terrible thing.	Kino kibi nnyo.
To me, it was.	Eri nze, yali.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe yali.
You know, for a long time.	Omanyi, okumala ebbanga ddene.
I'll move on.	Nja kugenda mu maaso.
He was in his room.	Yali mu kisenge kye.
He knew she looked good.	Yali akimanyi nti alabika bulungi.
In case you want to.	Mu mbeera nga oyagala.
I’m going to them.	Nze ngenda gye bali.
We have no power.	Tetulina maanyi.
That was a wonderful time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo.
Of course, he did.	Kya lwatu nti yakikola.
It’s not a hospital.	Si ddwaaliro.
And it’s pretty good.	Era kirungi nnyo.
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
We’ll know soon enough.	Tujja kumanya mangu.
Nothing now.	Tewali kintu kyonna kati.
But that is not the case here.	Naye wano si bwe kiri.
And he seems to love it.	Era alabika ayagala nnyo.
He said he couldn't tell.	Yagambye nti tasobola kumanya.
I thought that was it.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kye kyali.
The phone started ringing.	Essimu yatandika okukuba.
Perhaps he did.	Oboolyawo yakikola.
It is always the case.	Bulijjo bwe kiri.
Not saying anything.	Si kwogera kintu kyonna.
He knew both.	Bombi yali amanyi.
He could do anything with her.	Yali asobola okukola naye buli kimu.
It looks pretty good that they are.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo nti bwe bali.
This had to do now.	Kino kyalina okukola kati.
And it still is.	Era n’okutuusa kati bwe kiri.
It can be in the same room.	Kiyinza okuba mu kisenge kimu.
He always tried.	Bulijjo yagezaako.
He obviously knew what she was thinking.	Kya lwatu nti yali amanyi kye yali alowooza.
Maybe too soon for me.	Mpozzi nga mangu nnyo gyendi.
And now it is.	Era kati bwe kiri.
I’m going to work every day.	Ngenda kukola buli lunaku.
And of course we can.	Era ddala tusobola.
And indeed he was.	Era ddala bwe yali.
It can happen very soon.	Kiyinza okubaawo amangu ddala.
Someone he could talk to.	Omuntu gwe yali asobola okwogera naye.
I’m on here a lot.	Nze ndi ku wano nnyo.
Very helpful.	Obuyambi bungi nnyo.
But he doesn’t think about me.	Naye talowooza ku nze.
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
But the food was great.	Naye emmere yali nnungi nnyo.
He was already talking about me.	Yali yayogera dda ku nze.
I can do a lot.	Nsobola okukola bingi.
He knows best.	Asinga okumanya.
But it doesn’t really matter.	Naye si kikulu nnyo.
I'm not entirely sure how to go about this.	Sikakasa ddala ngeri ya kugenda mu maaso ku kino.
I have to make that call to someone.	Nnina okukuba omuntu essimu eyo.
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
I might as well do that.	Ekyo nnyinza bulungi okukikola.
She was a wonderful woman.	Yali mukyala mulungi nnyo.
Maybe he should have called.	Mpozzi yandibadde akuba essimu.
But you can’t really go anywhere.	Naye mu butuufu tosobola kugenda yonna.
And this is in the morning.	Era kino kiri ku makya.
It’s not a force.	Si maanyi.
I feel really lucky that way.	Mpulira nga ddala ndi wa mukisa mu ngeri eyo.
But I loved it.	Naye nnali njagala nnyo.
I guess they were both in this.	Ntebereza nti mu kino baali bombi.
Here's the thing.	Wano ekintu.
It’s not exactly easy.	Si ddala kyangu.
I want to be happy.	Njagala kubeera musanyufu.
He doesn’t want to go home.	Tayagala kudda waka.
You can’t do it.	Tosobola kukikola.
I hoped he would.	Nnali nsuubira nti ajja kukikola.
He was my patient.	Yali mulwadde wange.
He needed a friend.	Yali yeetaaga mukwano gwe.
But you’re not too sick.	Naye toli mulwadde nnyo.
And there is.	Era waliwo.
It could be a phone call.	Ayinza okuba essimu.
You will stay with us .	Ojja kusigala naffe .
What he is.	Kye ye.
It is very difficult for anyone.	Kizibu nnyo eri omuntu yenna.
It is a beautiful city.	Kibuga kirungi nnyo.
It was a good problem.	Kyali kizibu kirungi.
Not for long, though.	Kyokka si lwa bbanga ddene.
All he wanted was money.	Kye yali ayagala ssente.
No one asked about me.	Tewali yabuuza ku nze.
He honestly couldn’t believe he would.	Mu butuufu yali tayinza kukkiriza nti ajja kukikola.
Can you see it? 	Osobola okulaba?
In a way it doesn’t really matter.	Mu ngeri emu si kikulu nnyo.
I have to get out of here.	Nnina okuva wano.
My father did it too.	Taata naye yakikola.
And you have it, too.	Era naawe olina.
Now, you know.	Kati, omanyi.
He doesn’t even know me.	Tamanyi na nze.
That’s where he was.	Eyo gye yali.
I don’t care.	Sifaayo.
He thought she was beautiful.	Yalowooza nti yali mulungi.
That is very common.	Ekyo kya bulijjo nnyo.
But maybe that’s why.	Naye osanga y’ensonga lwaki.
I think you shouldn’t go.	Ndowooza tolina kugenda.
You probably should have gone without me.	Oboolyawo wandibadde ogenda nga sirina.
It's in the lower grade, he thought.	Kiri mu kibiina kya wansi, bwe yalowooza.
He couldn't stay here but, he couldn't.	Yali tasobola kusigala wano naye, yali tasobola.
He is in the house with you.	Ali mu nnyumba naawe.
I might be working tonight.	Nnyinza okuba nga nkola ekiro kino.
My father was the best.	Taata ye yali asinga.
But he knows it.	Naye akimanyi.
But it can backfire.	Naye kiyinza okudda emabega.
As one, we will be strong.	Nga omu, tujja kuba ba maanyi.
You probably already know how hard it was.	Oboolyawo omanyi dda engeri gye kyali kizibu.
He wasn’t going.	Yali tagenda.
And we need to act quickly.	Era twetaaga okukola amangu.
Too much in a hurry.	Bingi nnyo mu bwangu.
There is always something going on in the classroom.	Bulijjo waliwo ekigenda mu maaso mu kibiina.
Perhaps it had.	Oboolyawo kyalina.
That is certainly a serious problem.	Mazima ddala ekyo kizibu kya maanyi.
They are, of course.	Bali, ddala.
I think it would be easier.	Ndowooza kyandibadde kyangu.
It’s just not my thing.	Si kintu kyange kyokka.
That’s what we need.	Ekyo kye twetaaga.
Which he expected a lot from me.	Kye yali asuubira bingi ku nze.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
And it is this.	Era kye kino.
He knew that she knew that he knew.	Yali akimanyi nti yali akimanyi nti akimanyi.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
He talked to his wife about it.	Yayogera ne mukyala we ku nsonga eyo.
I will not speak again.	Sijja kuddamu kwogera.
He shouldn’t see something like that.	Talina kulaba kintu ng’ekyo.
He knew he would come.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kujja.
. . . .	.
Although he couldn’t, not really.	Wadde nga yali tasobola, si ddala.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
No one has experienced a city like this before.	Tewali muntu yenna yafuna kibuga nga kino emabegako.
I am very well off.	Ndi bulungi nnyo.
It was sudden.	Kyali kya mangu.
You really think there.	Ddala olowooza awo.
I’m in a big hurry.	Nze ndi mu bwangu bungi.
Surely, you are curious about it.	Mazima ddala, oyagala nnyo okumanya ku nsonga eyo.
He is all alone.	Yenna ali yekka.
However, he did not like his friends.	Kyokka yali tayagala mikwano gye.
It’s in the air.	Kiri mu bbanga.
It’s just too easy.	Kyangu nnyo kyokka.
It was a process.	Yali nkola.
Maybe he knows how to win, he thought.	Mpozzi amanyi okuwangula, bwe yalowooza.
I know you have to do this.	Nkimanyi nti kino olina okukikola.
Maybe he was fine.	Mpozzi nga yali bulungi.
Not in any way.	Si mu ngeri yonna.
You will have a little.	Ojja kuba n’akatono.
I don’t have anything.	Nze sirina kintu kyonna.
I'm like, this is so close.	Nze nga, kino kiri kumpi nnyo.
You have a plan of action.	Olina enteekateeka y’okukola.
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
That’s not always a good thing.	Ekyo si kintu kirungi bulijjo.
But that wasn’t my problem.	Naye ekyo si kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
But that won’t happen.	Naye ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
I want to keep feeling.	Njagala kusigala nga mpulira.
He was alone here.	Yali yekka wano.
He was my only nephew.	Yali mwana wa muganda wange yekka.
Who's there? 	Ani ali eyo?
. . . .	.
He was trying to be.	Yali agezaako okubeera.
Someone is afraid.	Omuntu atya.
Surely he should have known earlier.	Mazima ddala yandibadde amanyi emabegako.
You know you can’t drive down here.	Omanyi tosobola kuvuga wansi wano.
And there are so many more.	Era bingi nnyo.
For this approach.	Ku nkola eno.
That would be much easier.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
I do think that’s a possibility.	Nze ndowooza nti ekyo kiyinza okubaawo.
But no one came forward.	Naye tewali yajja mu maaso.
This, above all.	Kino, okusinga byonna.
All he knew.	Byonna bye yali amanyi.
Certainly not everything though.	Mazima ddala si buli kimu wadde.
You have to do it.	Ggwe olina okukikola.
For a while there was nothing.	Okumala akaseera nga tewali kintu kyonna.
It’s not dangerous.	Si kya bulabe.
In fact, he almost didn’t want to talk about it.	Mu butuufu, kumpi yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
Not just anyone can do that.	Ekyo si muntu yenna yekka asobola okukikola.
The problem is, we can’t.	Obuzibu buli nti, tetusobola.
He is willing to do it.	Ali mwetegefu okukikola.
I have to work hard.	Nnina okukola ennyo.
But now, no.	Naye kati, nedda.
I really really love being here.	Njagala nnyo nnyo okubeera wano.
The problem is with you, my friend.	Obuzibu buli ku ggwe mukwano gwange.
No one was into anything.	Tewali yali mu kintu kyonna.
I need help now.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi kati.
I want to read ahead.	Njagala okusoma mu maaso.
Maybe she could talk to him.	Mpozzi yali asobola okwogera naye.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
Maybe there isn’t.	Mpozzi nga tewali.
No one did anything.	Tewali yakola kintu kyonna.
This is what can happen.	Kino kye kiyinza okubaawo.
It will never work again.	Tekijja kuddamu kukola.
You can go home again.	Osobola okuddamu okudda eka.
Everything, anything, that’s what we’re here for.	Buli kimu, ekintu kyonna, ekyo kye tuli wano.
It’s not me.	Si nze.
I wasn’t sure about you.	Nze nali sikakasa ggwe.
It could be anyone.	Ayinza okuba omuntu yenna.
He did it.	Yakikola.
I would love to talk to you.	Njagala nnyo okwogera naawe.
You want to talk.	Oyagala kwogera.
You are not real.	Toli wa ddala.
There is something that we all need to know.	Waliwo ekintu ekyo ffenna kye twetaaga okumanya.
Money I don’t want.	Ssente ze saagala.
That in a way he was.	Ekyo mu ngeri emu gye yali.
She didn’t want a boyfriend at all.	Yali tayagala muganzi n’akatono.
He knew he could do it.	Yali akimanyi nti asobola okukikola.
The one who is stronger.	Oyo asinga amaanyi.
I really have no idea from here.	Mazima ddala sirina kirowoozo kyonna okuva wano.
It could be anything.	Kiyinza okuba nga buli kimu.
You've been an hour.	Obadde essaawa.
He knew it would come.	Yali akimanyi nti kijja kujja.
Not that it was something to really know.	Si nti kyali kintu kya kumanya ddala.
I know how to do it.	Nze mmanyi okukikola.
Considering everything.	Okulowooza ku buli kimu.
He has to be here.	Alina okubeera wano.
You can do anything.	Osobola okukola kyonna.
He was a very, very good man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo nnyo.
And he wanted to be.	Era yali ayagala okubeera.
I can’t say why.	Siyinza kwogera lwaki.
It would be normal.	Kyandibadde kya bulijjo.
He told me that night you don’t know.	Yangamba ekiro ekyo nti tomanyi.
I like to think the book is true.	Njagala nnyo okulowooza nti ekitabo kituufu.
But what he heard.	Naye bye yawulira.
This is actually quite simple.	Kino mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
Certainly not.	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
Always working hard and happy to help with anything.	Bulijjo akola nnyo era nga musanyufu okuyamba ku kintu kyonna.
I'm like that's bad.	Nze nga ekyo kibi.
John in about three weeks.	John mu wiiki nga ssatu.
He was in excellent shape.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
No, not really.	Nedda, si ddala.
He is the only one	Ye yekka .
I know he can do that.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo asobola okukikola.
Not all of it there.	Si byonna awo.
However, what he told me .	Kyokka bye yang’amba .
There’s something there.	Waliwo ekintu awo.
It’s not my opinion.	Si ndowooza yange.
She was really pretty though.	Ddala yali mulungi nnyo wadde.
There are many opinions.	Endowooza nnyingi.
You can’t win.	Tosobola kuwangula.
Do you know where it is? 	Omanyi gye kiri?
. . . .	.
That’s what he wanted.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala.
No one is better.	Tewali asinga.
I think any of us can do that.	Ndowooza buli omu ku ffe ekyo asobola okukikola.
Now everything goes.	Kati buli kimu kigenda.
I am just one person.	Nze ndi muntu omu yekka.
He may not have it.	Ayinza okuba nga talina.
Now he couldn’t do it.	Kati yali tasobola kukikola.
I have no one in this place.	Sirina muntu yenna mu kifo kino.
It’s a difficult problem.	Kizibu kizibu.
He looked very happy.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo.
He told me he was sick himself.	Yang’amba nti ye kennyini mulwadde.
She knew he wouldn't say anything.	Yali akimanyi nti tajja kwogera kintu kyonna.
But he knew he had to eat.	Naye yali akimanyi nti alina okulya.
That it is.	Nti bwe kiri.
This is a serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi.
There is no easy answer here.	Tewali kyangu kya kuddamu wano.
I like being one person.	Njagala nnyo okubeera omuntu omu.
I hope someone can help.	Nsuubira nti waliwo asobola okuyamba.
We were the only ones.	Ffe twali ffekka.
He knew it wouldn't happen.	Yali akimanyi nti tekijja kubaawo.
And we had no money.	Era twali tetulina ssente.
I will definitely do this again.	Mazima ddala nja kuddamu okukola kino.
That was my wife.	Oyo ye yali mukyala wange.
I am not sure how to proceed .	Sikakasa ngeri ya kugenda mu maaso .
This, this.	Oyo, oyo.
Very little but definitely.	Katono nnyo naye nga ddala.
I feel strong today.	Mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi leero.
We will do it.	Tujja kukikola.
You won’t find a better one here .	Tojja kufuna asinga wano .
He has to get home soon.	Alina okutuuka awaka mu bbanga ttono.
I need to know you want to.	Nnina okumanya nti oyagala.
The same is true today.	Ekintu kye kimu ne leero.
I was very sick.	Nnali mulwadde nnyo.
I am very curious.	Njagala nnyo okumanya.
And herein lies the problem.	Era wano we wali ekizibu.
But that’s true.	Naye ekyo kituufu.
I don’t think that’s true.	Ndowooza ekyo si kituufu.
I hope you can do it right.	Nsuubira nti osobola okukikola obulungi.
But that was great for me.	Naye ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo gyendi.
Everything will be as usual, actually.	Buli kimu kijja kuba nga bulijjo, mu butuufu.
He must step back.	Ateekwa okudda emabega.
Like you, how easy.	Nga ggwe, nga kyangu.
This is a job of work.	Guno mulimu gwa mulimu.
No purchase at this time.	Tewali kugula mu kiseera kino.
You have to know.	Olina okumanya.
Will you come???.	Ojja???.
No luck there, either.	Tewali mukisa awo, era.
It’s all over the city now.	Buli mu kibuga kyonna kati.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
That was just one guy.	Oyo yali ggaayi omu yekka.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
He got what he wanted.	Yafuna kye yali ayagala.
And maybe very lucky to be.	Era mpozzi nga wa mukisa nnyo okubeera.
It was almost good actually.	Kumpi kyali kirungi mu butuufu.
You know you will.	Omanyi nti ojja kukikola.
I was me, just me.	Nze nali nze, nze nzekka.
We are a threat to them.	Tuli ba bulabe gye bali.
He is not ready.	Tali mwetegefu.
He spoke to me.	Yayogera nange.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
I have something to say.	Nnina kye njagala okwogera.
Nothing is normal.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo.
Everyone knows it.	Buli omu akimanyi.
You won’t have to do it alone.	Tojja kuba na kukikola wekka.
That was all he had to say.	Ekyo kyokka kye yalina okwogera.
But he was there.	Naye yali awo.
This is really good, and really powerful.	Kino ddala kirungi, era ddala kya maanyi.
He says he doesn't want to get in trouble again.	Agamba nti tayagala kuddamu kufuna buzibu.
It was a plan.	Yali nteekateeka.
I suppose everyone will have to do that now.	Nsuubira nti buli muntu ajja kuba alina okukola ekyo kati.
I guess we’ll see.	Ntebereza tujja kulaba.
But yet as it is.	Naye naye nga bwe kiri.
There is no one at home.	Tewali muntu yenna waka.
We need to do this.	Kino twetaaga okukikola.
Maybe this, of course.	Mpozzi kino, ddala.
Someone to see.	Omuntu okulaba.
We are fine together.	Tuli bulungi nga tuli wamu.
And he was everywhere.	Era yali buli wamu.
It was really hard and you never know.	Ddala kyali kizibu nnyo era tomanyi.
It’s really good for you.	Ddala kirungi gyoli.
He really came on.	Ddala yajja ku.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
And of course you can’t.	Era ddala tosobola.
I am in the past.	Nze ndi emabegako.
He suddenly appeared, but he wasn’t alone.	Yalabika mangu, naye nga si yekka.
He didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala.
He was just a sick person.	Yali muntu mulwadde yekka.
The dog is good.	Embwa nnungi.
And it’s not good.	Era si kirungi.
But he loved it when he spoke.	Naye yali ayagala nnyo bwe yayogera.
We have one week.	Tulina wiiki emu.
The arrangement is excellent.	Enteekateeka nnungi nnyo.
said the other.	omulala bwe yagamba.
I think it’s practically true.	Ndowooza nti kituufu mu nkola.
This is not a matter of opinion.	Eno si nsonga ya ndowooza.
We will be	Tujja kuba .
I thought it was him.	Nalowooza nti ye.
And it’s a dangerous job.	Era mulimu gwa bulabe.
There is no one-to-one house.	Tewali nnyumba emu ku emu.
Or maybe it’s early.	Oba mpozzi nga bukyali.
I don’t think that’s true.	Sirowooza nti ekyo kituufu.
That’s not me.	Oyo si nze.
You are the best, my son!.	Ggwe asinga, mwana wange!.
He was probably already yesterday’s man.	Oboolyawo yali dda musajja wa jjo.
There is no reason.	Tewali nsonga yonna.
Here he is completely alone.	Wano ali yekka ddala.
Not a romantic boyfriend.	Si muganzi wa mukwano.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
I love getting here.	Njagala nnyo okutuuka wano.
I will be ready.	Nja kuba mwetegefu.
We have no issues.	Tetulina nsonga.
Or, or, or.	Oba, oba, oba.
And then this.	Era awo kino.
No one was on it.	Tewali yali ku yo.
I wonder how many.	Nze nneebuuza nti mmeka.
Everything seems normal.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
He is now in the hospital.	Kati ali mu ddwaaliro.
Your opinion is one opinion.	Endowooza yo ndowooza emu.
Office all morning.	Ofiisi enkya yonna.
I said, good job.	Nagamba nti, omulimu mulungi.
But there was nothing to eat there.	Naye nga tewali kya kulya eyo.
He had been in here too long already.	Yali amaze ebbanga ddene nnyo mu wano dda.
He went away.	Yagenda.
Maybe in the movies.	Mpozzi mu firimu.
That’s my whole point.	Eyo y’ensonga yange yonna.
He could have won.	Yali asobola okuwangula.
You can drive.	Osobola okuvuga.
He is really good.	Ye mulungi ddala.
And it’s very difficult.	Era nga kizibu nnyo.
You are my teacher.	Ggwe musomesa wange.
Here it was beautiful.	Wano kyali kirungi nnyo.
He should have known the police.	Yandibadde amanyi poliisi.
To him or to me.	Eri ye oba gyendi.
Perhaps someone has to go.	Oboolyawo omuntu alina okugenda.
This way there is nothing.	Mu ngeri eno tewali kintu kyonna.
Maybe he's having trouble finding one.	Mpozzi alina obuzibu okufuna emu.
I couldn’t speak.	Nnali sisobola kwogera.
I'm nothing to you.	Nze siri kintu kyonna gy'oli.
He was in all trouble.	Yali mu buzibu bwonna.
It will be good.	Kijja kuba kirungi.
It can go many ways.	Kiyinza okugenda mu ngeri nnyingi.
She was truly a wonderful woman to work with.	Mazima ddala yali mukyala mulungi nnyo okukola naye.
But just a little bit.	Naye katono ddala.
This will help everyone.	Kino kijja kuyamba buli muntu.
Here is a very good one.	Wano waliwo omulungi ennyo.
He didn’t know much about relationships.	Yali tamanyi bingi ku mukwano.
And in the morning .	Era ku makya .
And he will be fine.	Era ajja kuba bulungi.
It was obvious.	Kyali kirabika.
I know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi.
This is a great idea.	Kino kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
He is the only one.	Ye yekka.
I will be a man.	Nja kuba musajja.
You know what you want to do and why.	Omanyi ky’oyagala okukola era lwaki.
Now he’s the one.	Kati y’ali.
All that we have.	Byonna bye tulina.
I want to talk to him.	Njagala kwogera naye.
Indeed, he does.	Mazima ddala, akola bw’atyo.
Going to go to go.	Okugenda okugenda okugenda.
And that’s not a problem.	Era ekyo si kizibu.
But this is not the point here.	Naye eno si y’ensonga wano.
It’s a good thing he did.	Kirungi kye yakola.
In his room.	Mu kisenge kye.
That’s all this will do.	Ekyo kyokka kino kye kijja okukola.
It’s nothing to me.	Si kintu kyonna gyendi.
He loves to talk.	Ayagala nnyo okwogera.
That was his thing.	Ekyo kye kyali ekintu kye.
We can’t talk here.	Tetusobola kwogera wano.
I'm not sure how to go about this.	Sikakasa ngeri ya kugenda mu maaso na kino.
It had the same problem.	Kye kyalina ekizibu kye kimu.
He has no idea what he wants.	Talina kirowoozo kyonna ku ky’ayagala.
He wanted to talk about it.	Yali ayagala okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
Not about this.	Si ku nsonga eno.
He can see.	Asobola okulaba.
He wanted to deal with every problem.	Yali ayagala okukola ku buli kizibu.
How could he not.	Yali tasobola atya.
I have to get out of there.	Nnina okuva awo.
I won’t wait any longer.	Sijja kuddamu kulinda.
He can’t talk to her.	Tasobola kwogera naye.
I was willing to do just about anything.	Nnali mwetegefu okukola kumpi ekintu kyonna.
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo .
But this doesn’t seem to be the case.	Naye kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Although he did it in a way.	Wadde nga yakikola mu ngeri emu.
This is certainly true.	Mazima ddala kino kituufu.
You can do that at that point.	Ekyo oyinza okukikola mu kiseera ekyo.
That’s very unusual.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo nnyo.
He doesn’t have any office.	Talina ofiisi yonna.
No one had, really.	Tewali muntu yenna yalina, ddala.
This is really happening.	Kino ddala kigenda mu maaso.
But there isn’t.	Naye tewali.
I know that was hard.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo kyali kizibu.
No one knows where you are right now.	Tewali amanyi gyoli mu kiseera kino.
Just seeing everything.	Okulaba buli kimu kyokka.
He can’t go to the police.	Tasobola kugenda ku poliisi.
Terrible.	Kibi.
Here is my whole point.	Wano ensonga yange yonna.
I know he lives at home with his wife.	Nkimanyi nti abeera waka ne mukyala we.
Not like he had it.	Si nga bwe yalina.
Everything was right.	Buli kimu kyali kituufu.
Everything looks good.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi.
Or maybe it’s me.	Oba mpozzi nze.
One can see that.	Omuntu asobola okulaba ekyo.
I want these.	Njagala bino.
I am exactly the same.	Nze kye kimu ddala.
Not much help from anyone.	Si buyambi bungi okuva eri omuntu yenna.
I can’t live without you.	Siyinza kubeera nga tolina ggwe.
This was dangerous.	Kino kyali kya bulabe.
If only my wife was still with us.	Singa mukyala wange yali akyali naffe.
I have no strength.	Sirina maanyi.
He could have been like.	Yali asobola okuba nga.
Every day, though.	Buli lunaku, wadde.
He wanted to go.	Yali ayagala kugenda.
Monday is not good for me.	Mmande si mulungi gyendi.
However, reading is a real problem.	Kyokka, okusoma kizibu kya ddala.
He got a job.	Yafuna omulimu.
He said he was afraid to go home.	Yagambye nti atya okudda eka.
For a long time, he didn’t know.	Okumala ebbanga ddene, yali tamanyi.
Now is the time.	Kati kye kiseera.
He said it wasn’t.	Yagambye nti si bwe kiri.
He was powerless.	Yali talina maanyi.
I think you do too.	Ndowooza naawe okola.
It is very good	Kirungi nnyo .
And he hasn’t worked yet.	Era tannaba kukola.
We have some work to do here.	Tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola wano.
There are so many reasons.	Ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
Every single penny.	Buli ssente emu.
Then it was the bus.	Awo ye yali bbaasi.
I want this .	Njagala kino .
There is no real policy on this.	Tewali nkola ya ddala ku kino.
But here you have to be.	Naye wano olina okuba.
I said you won’t come.	Nagamba nti tojja kujja.
You can tell.	Osobola okumanya.
If they were me, if they were me.	Singa baali nze, singa baali nze.
He knows what is what.	Amanyi kiki kiki.
Good job, kid.	Omulimu mulungi, mwana.
Good, he said.	Kirungi, bwe yagambye.
But there is one.	Naye waliwo emu.
There is no emergency.	Tewali mbeera ya mangu.
He will be there.	Ajja kubeerawo.
It’s very important to me.	Kikulu nnyo gyendi.
I hope he has.	Nsuubira nti alina.
I have a dog.	Nnina embwa.
This is a beautiful house.	Eno nnyumba nnungi nnyo.
That’s still not all.	Ekyo n’okutuusa kati si kyokka.
She was so beautiful .	Yali mulungi nnyo .
He’s going to eat everyone there.	Agenda kulya buli muntu ali eyo.
I’m sure you know that.	Nkakasa nti ekyo okimanyi.
At the time, this seemed normal.	Mu kiseera ekyo, kino kyali kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
Maybe going to the city is right.	Mpozzi okugenda mu kibuga kituufu.
And you are lucky.	Era oli wa mukisa.
This was very sudden.	Kino kyali kya mangu nnyo.
You were my best friend.	Ggwe wali mukwano gwange asinga.
Nothing is there, but everything is there.	Tewali kintu kyonna kiri awo, naye buli kimu kiri awo.
He couldn’t go on.	Yali tasobola kugenda mu maaso.
This is very powerful.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo.
But you can’t tell.	Naye tosobola kumanya.
That, that, that one didn’t know.	Ekyo, ekyo, oyo yali tamanyi.
Here, let me .	Wano, ka nze .
Maybe we are.	Mpozzi nga tuli.
And he is with you.	Era ye wamu naawe.
We are very well off.	Tuli bulungi nnyo.
We need to talk to ourselves.	Twetaaga okwogera naffe.
Food is all we are.	Emmere ye kye tuli kyokka.
It looks bad to me.	Kirabika kibi gyendi.
Surely he would want to too.	Mazima ddala naye yandiyagadde naye.
My opinion, no one should have to be like that.	Endowooza yange, tewali yandibadde alina kubeera bw’atyo.
You are so beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo.
Not necessarily but there it is.	Si kituufu naye awo we kiri.
You’ll be fine now.	Ojja kuba bulungi kati.
It would be nice to be home.	Kyandibadde kirungi okubeera awaka.
I doubt you will.	Nbuusabuusa nti ojja kukikola.
I 'm not	Si nze .
But you have to work.	Naye olina okukola.
I need a picture.	Nze nneetaaga ekifaananyi.
Maybe more than that.	Mpozzi okusinga awo.
We have it too.	Naffe tulina.
he asked constantly.	yabuuza buli kiseera.
He had been reluctant to come.	Yali abadde tayagala kujja.
But it actually was.	Naye mu butuufu bwe kyali.
We can’t do without it.	Tetusobola kukola nga tetulina.
It was obviously good.	Kya lwatu nti kyali kirungi.
He and his brother.	Ye ne muganda we.
Or you, obviously.	Oba ggwe, kya lwatu.
In what circumstances.	Mu mbeera ki.
Back, back, back.	Emabega, emabega, emabega.
It’s almost too easy.	Kumpi kyangu nnyo.
He did that.	Ye yakola ekyo.
But this seems very complicated.	Naye kino kirabika nga kizibu nnyo.
That was basically the point.	Okusinga eyo ye yali ensonga.
For film, it’s exactly the same.	Ku firimu, kye kimu ddala.
Tomorrow will be better.	Enkya ejja kuba nnungi.
I feel completely alone.	Mpulira ddala nzekka.
But it’s not exactly like that.	Naye si bwe kiri ddala.
That was at home.	Ekyo kyali waka.
Above all, it’s simple.	Okusinga byonna, kyangu.
He expected her to be fast.	Yali asuubira nti ajja kuba wa bwangu.
Not immediately, and not for very long.	Si mangu ddala, era si okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
I don’t know anything about that.	Ekyo sirina kye nkimanyi.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I didn’t know it.	Nze nali simanyi.
He said he was coming.	Yagambye nti ajja.
He said it was good for you.	Yagamba nti kyali kirungi gy’oli.
This is really hard work.	Kino ddala mulimu gwa maanyi.
I love it so much!.	Njagala nnyo nnyo!.
In truth, it doesn’t matter.	Mu mazima, si kikulu.
It is not necessarily the case.	Si kituufu nti bwe kiri.
He was happy there.	Yali musanyufu eyo.
In theory it is as simple as that.	Mu ndowooza kyangu nga ekyo.
What do we have here? 	Kiki kye tulina wano?
This, of course, would be me.	Kino, kya lwatu, kyandibadde nze.
He knows he will have to.	Akimanyi nti ajja kuba alina okukikola.
Now everyone is here.	Kati buli omu ali wano.
It is on the schedule.	Kiri ku nteekateeka.
It was a powerful place.	Kyali kifo kya maanyi nnyo.
He and you, I'm sure.	Ye naawe, nkakasa.
I thought we’d make good time.	Nalowooza nti tujja kukola obudde obulungi.
Everyone in town knew it.	Buli muntu mu kibuga yali akimanyi.
I want to try to do it myself.	Njagala kugezaako kukikola nze kennyini.
I don’t care at all.	Sifaayo n’akatono.
But now it’s time to go home.	Naye kati kye kiseera okudda eka.
That's why he couldn't do it.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki yali tasobola kukikola.
He will be very good.	Ajja kuba mulungi nnyo.
On the subject of .	Ku nsonga ya .
I don’t think about being anyone.	Sirowooza ku kubeera muntu yenna.
You will be so lucky to have me.	Ojja kuba wa mukisa nnyo okubeera nange.
While beautiful, it’s not an easy place to live.	Wadde nga nnungi, si kifo kyangu kubeera.
I want this I want.	Njagala kino njagala.
Nothing will be good again.	Tewali kijja kuddamu kuba bulungi.
He certainly didn't really want to talk about it.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala nnyo kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
I have a role to play in that role.	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola mu kifo ekyo.
But he can’t drive.	Naye tasobola kuvuga.
We’ll all be nearby.	Ffenna tujja kuba kumpi awo.
He is currently.	Mu kiseera kino ye...
All in a hurry	Byonna mu bwangu .
However, we have today.	Kyokka, tulina leero.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
I want to know why.	Njagala okumanya lwaki.
He knew what he was.	Yali amanyi kye yali.
Happy to be with you.	Musanyufu okuba naawe.
But this is a tremendous opportunity.	Naye guno mukisa gwa maanyi nnyo.
He's at a party.	Ali ku kabaga.
Perhaps he thought this was all he was doing.	Oboolyawo yalowooza nti kino kyokka kye yali akola.
But we are not like that.	Naye ffe si bwe tuli.
He is near now.	Ali kumpi kati.
He felt in his own way.	Yawulira mu ngeri ye.
I love you too!.	Naawe njagala nnyo!.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
It’s simple but true.	Kyangu naye nga kituufu.
Not that that mattered.	Si nti ekyo kyali kikulu.
All for a lot of money.	Byonna ku ssente nnyingi.
It’s not a job.	Si mulimu.
I'm not sure what, exactly.	Sikakasa kiki, ddala.
I think this is a great idea.	Ndowooza kino kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
He said he would stay on.	Yagambye nti ajja kusigala ku.
He said fine, fine.	Yagamba nti kirungi, kirungi.
I wish everyone would.	Njagala buli omu yandikoze.
They were really really friendly.	Baali ba mukwano ddala ddala.
Little by little, now.	Katono katono, kati.
I feel like yourself.	Nze mpulira nga naawe kennyini.
Or, perhaps, a little bit more accurate.	Oba, mpozzi, katono ddala nga kituufu.
That’s fine, but it won’t work.	Ekyo kirungi naye tekijja kukola.
He was very good to me.	Yali mulungi nnyo gyendi.
He did nothing but study.	Tewali kye yakola okuggyako okusoma.
He is just a good player.	Ye muzannyi mulungi yekka.
He said he wasn’t alone.	Yagambye nti si ye yekka.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
He's a really nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi ddala.
This had to happen.	Kino kyalina okubaawo.
He was all there.	Yenna yali awo.
It’s great for someone too.	Kirungi nnyo eri omuntu naye.
I can’t see down here.	Sisobola kulaba wansi wano.
It’s not really the same thing.	Mu butuufu si kintu kye kimu.
He thought backwards.	Yalowooza emabega.
This is an obvious approach.	Eno nkola ya lwatu.
You always have trouble .	Bulijjo olina obuzibu .
We will talk to him.	Tujja kwogera naye.
I don’t like this at all.	Kino sikyagala n’akatono.
Call right away.	Kuba amangu ddala.
No one knows the right answer.	Tewali amanyi kya kuddamu kituufu.
But that’s the point.	Naye eyo y’ensonga.
He would have been strong.	Yandibadde alina amaanyi.
This whole office, this job, all of it.	Ofiisi eno yonna, omulimu guno, byonna.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
This is all we need.	Kino kyokka kye twetaaga.
But nothing will matter.	Naye tewali kijja kuba kikulu.
I could do .	Nnali nsobola okukola .
What he says is no.	Kye agamba nti nedda.
This was going to happen.	Kino kyali kigenda kubaawo.
For a moment, he didn’t know who she was.	Okumala akaseera, yali tamanyi ani.
He was sick at the time.	Yali mulwadde mu kiseera ekyo.
Or maybe, that wasn’t it.	Oba mpozzi, ekyo si kye kyali.
He had no money.	Yali talina ssente.
Doing something like that is very difficult.	Okukola ekintu ng’ekyo kizibu nnyo.
This is not the same.	Kino si kimu.
About a week.	Nga wiiki.
He is the power.	Ye maanyi.
But he couldn’t do it.	Naye yali tasobola kukikola.
It could have been almost anything.	Kyandibadde kumpi ekintu kyonna.
He's always known it.	Bulijjo abadde akimanyi.
For me, that’s very important.	Nze ekyo kikulu nnyo.
To no one else.	Eri tewali muntu yenna.
You know you want to.	Omanyi nti oyagala.
He probably was, a little.	Oboolyawo yali, katono.
I’m a father.	Nze ndi taata.
I had lost hope.	Nnali nfunye essuubi.
Or the father, or.	Oba taata, oba.
They're here, he thought.	Bali wano, bwe yalowooza.
They’re in a movie.	Bali mu firimu.
And he knows it.	Era akimanyi.
Or not immediately, anyway.	Oba si mangu ddala, mu ngeri yonna.
He probably knows it himself.	Oboolyawo ye kennyini akimanyi.
He won't eat.	Tajja kulya.
There is power.	Waliwo amaanyi.
However, he has to think hard.	Kyokka, alina okulowooza ennyo.
Anything can happen in this place.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo mu kifo kino.
It’s not a city.	Si kibuga.
But this is the thing.	Naye kino kye kintu.
You were busy at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo wali bbize.
I think he’s a man.	Ndowooza nti musajja.
It’s good and it’s good.	Kirungi era kirungi.
But we can’t do this.	Naye kino tetusobola kukikola.
Everyone has one.	Buli muntu alina emu.
But it’s not for everyone.	Naye si kya buli muntu.
I am very fast.	Nze ndi wa bwangu nnyo.
He was an ordinary man.	Yali muntu wa bulijjo.
That was great, just like you.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo, nga ggwe.
No, it wasn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kyali.
I have to preach.	Nze nnina okubuulira.
It’s his idea.	Kye kirowoozo kye.
You don’t really want to know.	Mu butuufu toyagala kumanya.
This is the point of the film.	Eno y’ensonga ya firimu eno.
How does he know.	Amanyi atya.
Nothing was right.	Tewali kyali kituufu.
There is no harm in trying.	Tewali bulabe bwonna mu kugezaako.
We have so much more.	Tulina bingi nnyo.
He'll know you're there.	Ajja kumanya nti oli awo.
I’m not an artist.	Si nze muyimbi.
But really, it seems like it.	Naye ddala, kirabika nga bwe kiri.
He always wants me on him.	Bulijjo ayagala nze ku ye.
He is sick, anyway.	Ali mulwadde, mu ngeri yonna.
I have to help.	Nnina okuyamba.
And it’s so beautiful.	Era nga kirungi nnyo.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kintu kimu.
But, this comes at a cost.	Naye, kino kijja ku ssente.
I wonder if it’s true.	Nze nneebuuza oba kituufu.
I can’t be doing this.	Kino siyinza kuba nga nkola.
Not even that.	Si wadde ekyo.
And I'm there.	Nange gyendi.
There is only you, here and now.	Waliwo ggwe wekka, wano ne kati.
But he must be happy.	Naye alina okuba nga musanyufu.
I am the only one.	Nze nze nzekka.
He speaks.	Ayogera.
Like, really something.	Nga, ddala ekintu.
This is happening now.	Kino kigenda mu maaso kati.
However, he looked good.	Kyokka yalabika bulungi.
It will certainly work well at night.	Mazima ddala kijja kukola bulungi ekiro.
I wanted that more than anything.	Ekyo nnali njagala okusinga byonna.
But not for very long.	Naye si lwa bbanga ddene nnyo.
This is obviously not good.	Kino kirabika si kirungi.
Now he is very happy.	Kati ye musanyufu nnyo.
Of course this can happen.	Kya lwatu kino kiyinza okubaawo.
Or not working.	Oba obutakola.
I know he is real.	Nkimanyi nti wa ddala.
Not this morning.	Si enkya ya leero.
We need to know what it is.	Tulina okumanya kye kiri.
However, it is not dangerous.	Kyokka, si kya bulabe.
It was always just one.	Bulijjo kyali kimu kyokka.
There are many opinions.	Endowooza nnyingi.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
Just what we needed.	Kye twali twetaaga kyokka.
I have no problem with that.	Ekyo sirina buzibu bwonna.
He can’t see anything.	Tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
I have no idea .	Nze sirina kirowoozo kyonna .
It doesn’t come.	Tekijja.
It’s an idea.	Kye kirowoozo.
I was pretty sure it was a man.	Nali nkakasa bulungi nti yali musajja.
Why no one knows.	Lwaki tewali amanyi.
We have a lot of .	Tulina nnyo .
Everyone wanted to work, but there was nothing to do.	Buli omu yali ayagala okukola, naye nga tewali kya kukola.
He didn't know what to say.	Yali tamanyi kya kwogera.
And it may be the case.	Era kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
Why is it down?.	Lwaki kiri wansi?.
He knows this now.	Kino akimanyi kati.
He said he was so afraid.	Yagambye nti atya bwatyo.
But that’s the only one.	Naye oyo yekka.
And yet, too.	Era naye, naye.
He had nothing in him.	Yali talina kintu kyonna mu ye.
You have no strength.	Tolina maanyi.
You have to go.	Olina okugenda.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
It can happen.	Kiyinza okubaawo.
No way at all.	Tewali ngeri yonna n’akatono.
It’s a pretty good movie.	Firimu nnungi nnyo.
This is why you come here.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki ojja wano.
You can’t answer this idea too much.	Tosobola kuddamu ndowooza eno nnyo.
Actually, there is no money.	Mu butuufu, tewali ssente.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
We cannot allow this kind of thing to happen too often.	Tetusobola kukkiriza kintu kya ngeri eno kubaawo nnyo.
This is not hard to see.	Kino si kizibu kulaba.
But it is the case.	Naye bwe kiri.
He could have been, but he wasn’t.	Yali asobola okuba, naye si bwe yali.
You know, your opinion.	Omanyi, endowooza yo.
Nothing good could be happening.	Tewali kirungi kiyinza kuba nga kigenda mu maaso.
What they were.	Kye baali.
And well .	Era bulungi .
We will do this together.	Kino tujja kukikola ffenna.
And you don’t have to bring anything.	Era tolina kujja na kintu kyonna.
This is very important to me.	Kino kikulu nnyo gyendi.
You don’t have anyone.	Tolina muntu yenna.
This is mine.	Kino kyange.
It was for a good reason.	Kyali lwa nsonga nnungi.
It seems like it always would.	Kirabika bulijjo kyandibadde.
Now if it isn’t.	Kati oba si bwe kiri.
Something like that .	Ekintu nga ekyo .
Everything will work.	Buli kimu kijja kukola.
I can’t do anything, not even read.	Sisobola kukola kintu, wadde okusoma.
He's that good.	Ye mulungi bw'atyo.
At this point it is my turn to speak.	Mu kiseera kino kye kiseera kyange okwogera.
It looks good.	Kirabika kirungi.
There's hope for you yet.	Waliwo essuubi gy'oli n'okutuusa kati.
I could barely speak.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kwogera.
And that’s the point.	Era eyo y’ensonga.
You’re already here.	Obadde dda wano.
They certainly were.	Mazima ddala baali.
All or nothing.	Byonna oba tewali.
You won’t get lucky with this.	Kino tojja kufuna mukisa.
But you come with me.	Naye ggwe ojja nange.
It was more complicated than that.	Kyali kizibu okusinga ekyo.
I have a reason why.	Nnina ensonga lwaki.
This was at home.	Kino kyali waka.
However, there is no urgency.	Kyokka, tewali bwangu.
In fact, he couldn’t wait to go, either.	Mu butuufu, naye yali tasobola kulinda kugenda, era.
You don’t have to be alone.	Tolina kubeera wekka.
You have to go now.	Olina okugenda kati.
Not that much.	Si ekyo nnyo.
But we were very lucky.	Naye twali ba mukisa nnyo.
She looked so beautiful and happy.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo era nga musanyufu.
We all have .	Ffenna tulina .
And no one will come.	Era tewali ajja kujja.
And not without you.	Era si nga tolina ggwe.
And so far only this.	Era n’okutuusa kati kino kyokka.
We come here to study.	Tujja wano okusoma.
I said absolutely.	Nagamba ddala.
It's about.	Kiri ku...
The thing is .	Ekintu kiri nti .
I make the time.	Nkola obudde.
There is so much in it.	Mulimu bingi nnyo.
You can certainly do whatever you want.	Mazima ddala oyinza okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
Now is the only time.	Kati kye kiseera kyokka.
It was his house.	Yali nnyumba ye.
But now he had no time.	Naye kati yali talina budde.
I feel normal.	Mpulira nga ndi wa bulijjo.
That’s why he’s in.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki ali mu.
A    .	OMU .
He did it now.	Yakikola kati.
I've got one issue.	Nze nfunye ensonga emu.
I’ve got one.	Nze nfunye emu.
That is what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
That’s just not true.	Ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
In fact, he was, too.	Mu butuufu, naye bwe yali.
It was a beautiful room.	Kyali kisenge kirungi nnyo.
He did that.	Ye yakola ekyo.
That would be something.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu.
He does this all the time.	Kino akikola buli kiseera.
I have hope.	Nnina essuubi.
No one really knew what it was.	Tewali yali amanyi ddala kiki kye kyali.
And that wasn’t the case here.	Era ekyo si bwe kyali wano.
That is not the case here.	Ekyo si bwe kiri wano.
It is my approach.	Ye nkola yange.
And so he was.	Era bw’atyo bwe yali.
He can go.	Asobola okugenda.
It’s not my wedding.	Si mbaga yange.
Indeed, he already has.	Mazima ddala, yakikola dda.
To himself, to himself alone.	Eri ye kennyini, eri ye yekka.
We can’t even talk about it.	Tetusobola na kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
Basically the same thing.	Okusinga kye kimu.
He had no intention of leaving now.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna kya kugenda kati.
It was good in a way.	Kyali kirungi mu ngeri emu.
That's mine.	Oyo wange.
That it was a police matter.	Nti yali nsonga ya poliisi.
I was the beautiful one.	Nze nnali mulungi.
It’s just not a good idea.	Si kirowoozo kirungi kyokka.
It is on his city.	Kiri ku kibuga kye.
He needed to be alone .	Yali yeetaaga okubeera yekka .
He wanted to be down there.	Yali ayagala kubeera wansi awo.
It will always stay with me.	Bulijjo kijja kusigala nange.
There is no place for me.	Tewali kifo kyange.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
. . . .	.
This house will be you.	Ennyumba eno ejja kuba ggwe.
However, that is not a huge issue for me.	Kyokka, eyo si nsonga ya maanyi nnyo gyendi.
Or he thought he would.	Oba yalowooza nti yandibadde.
This was a common practice.	Eno yali nkola ya bulijjo.
You can do that too.	Ekyo naawe osobola okukikola.
It is true that they are here.	Kituufu nti bali wano.
He is as good as anyone.	Mulungi nnyo nga omuntu yenna.
I don’t know what to say.	Simanyi kya kwogera.
Nothing of any kind.	Tewali kintu kya ngeri yonna.
. . . .	.
You are very happy.	Oli musanyufu nnyo.
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
I was the one who was sick.	Nze nnali mulwadde.
And he had a reason.	Era yalina ensonga.
I need to talk to you.	Nnina okwogera naawe.
And now they were both.	Era kati baali bombi.
She was as good as she had ever been.	Yali mulungi nga bwe yali abadde.
He doesn’t even have to try to do this.	Kino talina na kugezaako kukikola.
And apparently he did.	Era kirabika nga bwe yakola.
It will certainly be very powerful.	Mazima ddala kijja kuba kya maanyi nnyo.
Nothing normal there, you might think.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo awo, oyinza okulowooza.
At the time, no one was talking about it.	Mu kiseera ekyo, tewali yali ayogera ku nsonga eno.
I suppose you didn’t know.	Nsuubira nti wali tomanyi.
Here it is.	Wano we wali.
He could go back to school.	Yali asobola okuddamu okusoma.
However, he did.	Kyokka, yakikola.
Call for schedule.	Kuba essimu okufuna enteekateeka.
That would be very difficult.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
I thought you were one of us.	Nnalowooza nti oli omu ku ffe.
They were fine.	Baali bulungi.
And it will never happen again.	Era tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
We have each other, he thought.	Tulina buli omu, bwe yalowooza.
There is an opportunity here.	Waliwo omukisa wano.
But it’s a reason.	Naye nga nsonga.
Nobody wants to play with us.	Tewali ayagala kuzannya naffe.
But, you should go all out.	Naye, wandibadde ogenda byonna.
I think it’s in the air.	Ndowooza kiri mu bbanga.
He knew he couldn't do it.	Yali akimanyi bulungi nti tasobola kukikola.
You have no idea who.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna ku ani.
He still has no such attitude.	N’okutuusa kati talina ndowooza ya ngeri eyo.
My wife is also sick.	Mukyala wange naye mulwadde.
I was at home.	Nnali waka.
I can do my job well.	Omulimu gwange nsobola okukola obulungi.
And in the air.	Era mu bbanga.
I actually hope it’s true.	Mu butuufu nsuubira nti kituufu.
You have to eat all your food.	Olina okulya emmere yo yonna.
I love it here.	Njagala nnyo wano.
The thing is very plain.	Ekintu kiri kya lwatu nnyo.
I’m afraid it’s not.	Ntya si bwe kiri.
. . . .	.
That’s not what everyone was talking about at the time.	Ekyo si buli muntu nti yali ayogera ku nsonga eyo mu kiseera ekyo.
You can’t win.	Tosobola kuwangula.
This is very common.	Kino kya bulijjo nnyo.
This will be happening everywhere.	Kino kijja kuba kigenda mu maaso buli wamu.
I love to eat well.	Njagala nnyo okulya obulungi.
It was very, very bad.	Kyali kibi nnyo nnyo.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
No, he's fine.	Nedda, ali bulungi.
And we can’t stay.	Era tetusobola kusigala.
I can’t do anything.	Sirina kye nsobola kukola.
I don’t know why not.	Simanyi lwaki nedda.
Do you want to know too?.	Naawe oyagala okumanya?.
It was good, really good.	Yali nnungi, nga nnungi ddala.
He had been living here with his wife.	Wano yali abadde abeera ne mukyala we.
But it was pretty cool.	Naye kyali kirungi nnyo.
Or very close.	Oba kumpi nnyo.
But it was important to me.	Naye kyali kikulu gyendi.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Tewali, tewali, tewali.
I’m sick of winning.	Nze ndi mulwadde okuwangula.
And it’s easy to see why.	Era kyangu okulaba lwaki.
One just has to agree to help.	Omuntu alina kumala kukkiriza kuyamba.
He says he won’t.	Agamba nti tajja kukikola.
He knows that now.	Ekyo akimanyi kati.
I’ll just say one thing very quickly.	Nja kwogera kintu kimu kyokka mu bwangu ddala.
That’s what he needed.	Ekyo yali yeetaaga.
He was just a musician.	Yali muyimbi yekka.
What a wonderful man he was.	Nga yali musajja mulungi nnyo.
He knows so much.	Amanyi bingi nnyo.
He was well aware of that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi bulungi.
He wanted a car.	Yali ayagala mmotoka.
I can picture that.	Nsobola okukuba ekifaananyi ekyo.
This is actually a very serious issue.	Eno mu butuufu nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
And that’s not as it is.	Era ekyo si nga bwe kiri.
And that goes for everything.	Era ekyo kigenda ku buli kimu.
He knew better than anyone else now.	Yali amanyi okusinga omuntu omulala yenna kati.
However, that is not the point here.	Kyokka, ekyo si kye kikulu wano.
The night was drawing on.	Ekiro kyali kigenda kigenda mu maaso.
Everyone has a reason.	Buli omu alina ensonga.
We were there.	Twali awo.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka kino si bwe kiri.
He has been flipping through a book.	Abadde akuba ekitabo.
It comes and goes.	Kijja ne kigenda.
Now I am the only one.	Kati nze nzekka.
I have been.	Mbadde.
It’s hard to go back.	Kizibu okudda emabega.
However, I don’t think you will.	Kyokka sirowooza nti ojja kukikola.
It was really beautiful.	Ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
I couldn’t go anywhere, do anything.	Nnali sisobola kugenda yonna, kukola kintu kyonna.
But you .	Naye ggwe .
I guess it was the same then.	Ntebereza nti ne mu kiseera ekyo kyali kye kimu.
In theory it was easy.	Mu ndowooza kyali kyangu.
And nothing good.	Era tewali kirungi kyonna.
You know that.	Ekyo okimanyi.
And facing…	Era nga ayolekedde...
But he knows it, of course.	Naye akimanyi, ddala.
That is now actually true.	Ekyo kati mu butuufu kituufu.
It’s not a problem of complexity.	Si kizibu kya buzibu.
I always want to be moving forward.	Bulijjo njagala kubeera nga ngenda mu maaso.
I'll be together soon.	Nja kubeera wamu mu bbanga ttono.
I’m afraid to think.	Ntya okulowooza.
You don’t have to answer right away.	Tolina kuddamu mangu ddala.
I want to do this right.	Kino njagala kukikola bulungi.
That’s what he would do.	Ekyo kye yandikoze.
These things you need to know.	Ebintu bino olina okumanya.
And he has it.	Era alina.
You should, anyway.	Ggwe wandibadde, mu ngeri yonna.
He doesn’t have to stay here.	Talina kusigala wano.
There were so many things he could never know.	Ebintu bingi nnyo bye yali tayinza kumanya.
I actually loved it.	Mu butuufu nnali njagala nnyo.
You can’t come to us yet.	Tosobola kujja gye tuli n’okutuusa kati.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
And this is going to happen.	Era kino kigenda kubaawo.
It was nowhere he wanted to be.	Tewali we yali ayagala kubeera.
And everyone knows it.	Era buli omu akimanyi.
I'm going to have to go with him.	Ngenda kuba nnina okugenda ne ye.
Anyone at all could have done it.	Omuntu yenna n’akatono yandibadde asobola okukikola.
We are a local group.	Tuli kibiina kya wano.
All the things he saw.	Ebintu byonna bye yalaba.
I want to know what it is.	Njagala okumanya kye kiri.
What it really was, was this.	Kye kyali ddala, kyali kino.
He had probably already done it.	Oboolyawo yali amaze okukikola.
And don’t go anywhere, though.	Era togenda yonna, wadde.
In the car.	Mu mmotoka.
The money is good.	Ssente nnungi.
But that is not true.	Naye ekyo si kya mazima.
He did, as he should have.	Yakola, nga bwe yandibadde.
He was good, not good.	Yali mulungi, si mulungi.
It will be a powerful process.	Kijja kuba nkola ya maanyi.
He had only one.	Yalina omu yekka.
It is so real, so powerful.	Kya ddala nnyo, kya maanyi nnyo.
It hoped he would like the dog.	Kyalina essuubi nti yandiyagadde embwa.
If it were true.	Singa kyali kituufu.
It is your opinion.	Ye ndowooza yo.
But please .	Naye nsaba .
I'm not sure though.	Nze sikakasa wadde.
I don’t know where to go from here.	Simanyi gye nnyinza kugenda okuva wano.
We were so hungry, we needed to eat.	Twali enjala nnyo, nga twetaaga okulya.
It was much easier that way.	Kyali kyangu nnyo mu ngeri eyo.
But in case you are alone, you will have this.	Naye mu mbeera nga oli wekka, ojja kuba na kino.
But he was for everyone at the same time.	Naye yali wa buli muntu mu kiseera kye kimu.
He had a problem.	Yalina ekizibu.
So he did it now.	Bw’atyo yakikola kati.
I didn’t want to try it yet.	Nnali saagala kugezaako n’okutuusa kati.
And for what reason.	Era ku nsonga ki.
Which he really wanted.	Kye yali ayagala ennyo.
He could go to school.	Yali asobola okugenda ku ssomero.
Indeed, there is.	Ddala, waliwo.
I do love to cum.	Nze nkola njagala nnyo okumala.
That was a very simple time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kyangu nnyo.
I know there is.	Nkimanyi nti waliwo.
The point went home.	Ensonga yagenda eka.
He is also a very good singer.	Era muyimbi mulungi nnyo.
What a difficult thing.	Nga kizibu nnyo.
Perhaps he was.	Oboolyawo yali.
You're at home.	Oli waka.
In fact, he hoped it would.	Mu butuufu, yalina essuubi nti kijja kubaawo.
You might want to rethink all of this.	Oyinza okuddamu okulowooza ku bino byonna.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
He can barely speak.	Tasobola bulungi kwogera.
I really have to go home.	Mazima ddala nnina okudda eka.
He didn’t quite know what to do.	Yali tamanyi bulungi kya kukola.
No one talked to him about it.	Tewali yayogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
There is someone else.	Waliwo omuntu omulala.
Actually, no, that’s not true.	Mu butuufu, nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
And as always.	Era nga bulijjo.
He was a very nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo.
But that’s not why they’re there.	Naye si y’ensonga lwaki bali awo.
I didn’t think he would be interested.	Nnali sirowooza nti yandibadde ayagala.
But now, you’re here.	Naye kati, oli wano.
We have to talk to him.	Tulina okwogera naye.
This is good on his part.	Kino kirungi ku ludda lwe.
Now, enough talking.	Kati, okwogera kumala.
I said of course.	Nagamba nti ddala.
You know, even.	Omanyi ne.
That was a real problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu ddala.
This is a lot of money.	Eno ssente nnyingi nnyo.
You can say that .	Osobola okugamba nti .
That’s all there is to it.	Ekyo kyokka kye kiri.
I think that .	Nze ndowooza nti .
He thought he would surely be sick.	Yalowooza nti mazima ddala yandibadde mulwadde.
It’s not very complicated, but it’s very common.	Si kizibu nnyo, naye kya bulijjo nnyo.
Or perhaps he was.	Oba oboolyawo bwe yali.
I didn’t know what to do.	Nali simanyi kya kukola.
But honestly, it was a little quick.	Naye mu butuufu, kyali kya mangu katono.
He is that good.	Ye mulungi bwatyo.
I love having him on.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye ku...
This was very powerful for us.	Kino kyali kya maanyi nnyo gye tuli.
And he likely won’t.	Era kirabika tajja kukikola.
As was the picture.	Nga bwe kyali ekifaananyi.
This was obviously hard to get.	Kino kya lwatu kyali kizibu okufuna.
Back in him.	Okudda mu ye.
But that was too easy.	Naye ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo.
It’s easy but it’s complicated.	Kyangu naye nga kizibu.
It won’t be too bad.	Tekijja kuba kibi nnyo.
There he was, himself.	Eyo gye yali, ye kennyini.
Where is the father.	Taata ali ludda wa.
But now he had to go.	Naye kati yalina okugenda.
His brother went to this place.	Muganda we yagenda mu kifo kino.
No, you have to go.	Nedda, olina okugenda.
But here, you can.	Naye wano, osobola.
He said that, he said.	Yagambye nti, bwe yagambye.
But he said no.	Naye n’agamba nti nedda.
Or almost everything.	Oba kumpi buli kimu.
But it’s hard to answer.	Naye kizibu okuddamu.
I don't know.	Simanyi.
What was that? 	Ekyo kyali ki?
I'm hungry and hungry.	Nange enjala enjala.
Now you will be able to do it.	Kati ojja kusobola okukikola.
We can deliver what you want or we can't.	Tusobola okutuusa ky'oyagala oba tetusobola.
And that’s what’s happening.	Era ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso.
In fact, it is much, much lower.	Mu butuufu, kiri wansi nnyo nnyo.
It would be nice to know.	Kyandibadde kirungi okumanya.
Or maybe it’s just me.	Oba mpozzi nze nzekka.
But your opinion is.	Naye endowooza yo eri nti.
My father did it.	Taata yakikola.
I wish it wasn’t.	Njagala nnyo nga si bwe kiri.
If only he were here .	Singa yali wano .
He was a really nice kid.	Yali mwana mulungi ddala.
I’m really like you.	Nze ddala ndi nga ggwe.
I can today.	Nsobola leero.
I don’t want to go down there again.	Saagala kuddamu kugenda wansi eyo.
Good job though.	Omulimu mulungi wadde.
However, for a short time.	Kyokka, okumala akaseera katono.
It’s a thing.	Kye kintu.
I’ve been to one.	Nze mbadde ku emu.
He couldn't really talk.	Mu butuufu yali tasobola kwogera.
You want to	Oyagala .
Maybe we can help.	Mpozzi tusobola okuyamba.
Very easy, of course.	Kyangu nnyo, ddala.
It was all everyone did.	Kyali kyokka buli omu kye yakola.
But you are lucky in a way.	Naye oli wa mukisa mu ngeri emu.
He is a young child.	Ye mwana muto.
You can do a lot of things.	Osobola okukola ebintu bingi.
It seems simple to me.	Kirabika nga kyangu gyendi.
Can anyone help please.	Waliwo asobola okuyamba nsaba.
He knew he had to get out of here.	Yali akimanyi nti alina okuva wano.
We have to move on here.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso wano.
He won’t do that.	Ekyo tajja kukikola.
He wanted to know everything.	Yali ayagala okumanya buli kimu.
Who is anyone.	Ani omuntu yenna.
Something he said.	Ekintu kye yayogera.
I was a man.	Nze nali musajja.
Probably, there is.	Oboolyawo, waliwo.
Doing something every week.	Okukola ekintu buli wiiki.
Good for you to see home.	Kirungi ggwe okulaba awaka.
I guess he is human.	Ntebereza nti ye muntu.
Not exactly at the same time, he thought.	Si mu kiseera kye kimu ddala, bwe yalowooza.
But, it doesn’t matter.	Naye, si kikulu.
Maybe it was just as good this way.	Mpozzi nga kyali kirungi nnyo mu ngeri eno.
As it should be.	Nga bwe kyandibadde.
I do the same as always.	Nze nkola kye kimu nga bulijjo.
And that was true.	Era ekyo kyali kituufu.
It’s not a problem for us.	Si kizibu gye tuli.
He may be a bad guy.	Ayinza okuba nga kibi.
The morning went on.	Enkya yagenda mu maaso.
It’s really easy.	Ddala kyangu.
But he really didn’t want to.	Naye mu butuufu yali tayagala.
And he did it very well.	Era yakikola bulungi nnyo.
I want to go back to the party.	Njagala kudda ku mbaga.
In fact, it was.	Mu butuufu, bwe kyali.
He has to do something.	Waliwo ky’alina okukola.
He had a brother.	Yalina muganda we.
I can do the same.	Nze nsobola okukola kye kimu.
That’s all we have to go on.	Ekyo kyokka kye tulina okugenda mu maaso.
But he said no, too.	Naye naye n’agamba nti nedda.
I'll be fine tomorrow.	Nja kuba bulungi enkya.
He shouldn’t be alone.	Tasaanidde kubeera yekka.
I am here, but he is there.	Nze ndi wano, naye ali awo.
In his room.	Mu kisenge kye.
Everyone knows that.	Ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
I was feeling good today.	Nali mpulira bulungi leero.
But how to do that.	Naye engeri y’okukola ekyo.
Someone like me.	Omuntu nga nze.
He, was, capable of this.	Ye, yali, asobola kino.
He does a good job.	Akola omulimu mulungi.
True and beautiful.	Kituufu era nga kirungi nnyo.
That wasn’t what was wrong, it was mine.	Ekyo si kye kyali kibi, kyali kyange.
You can be a blessing to them in that position.	Osobola okuba omukisa gye bali mu kifo ekyo.
It isn’t and it doesn’t exist.	Si bwe kiri era tewali.
But of course you will.	Naye ddala ojja kukikola.
Or maybe both of us.	Oba oboolyawo ffembi.
It was just something he said.	Kyali kintu kyokka kye yayogera.
That was mine.	Oyo yali wange.
He is a good man.	Ye musajja mulungi.
But it’s dangerous.	Naye kya bulabe.
I’m not in school.	Nze siri mu ssomero.
I am truly sorry.	Mazima ddala nsonyiwa.
Then we have this.	Awo tulina kino.
No, not your house.	Nedda, si nnyumba yo.
And, you know, that would be nice.	Era, omanyi, ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
About an hour.	Ssaawa nga emu.
And he wanted nothing more.	Era yali talina ky’ayagala okuggyako ekyo.
This will not be easy.	Kino tekijja kuba kyangu.
Now he's almost safe, he thought.	Kati kumpi ali mu mbeera nnungi, bwe yalowooza.
All these things.	Ebintu bino byonna.
And with someone as good as you .	Era nga olina omuntu omulungi nga ggwe .
This was a terrible thing.	Kino kyali kibi nnyo.
That will be enough.	Ekyo kijja kumala.
Why, he didn't know.	Lwaki, yali tamanyi.
It’s very hard to beat.	Kizibu nnyo okukuba.
You will come back that way.	Ojja kudda mu ngeri eyo.
And, we have.	Era, tulina.
We can certainly do that.	Ekyo mazima ddala tusobola okukikola.
I was so close.	Nali kumpi nnyo.
That's obviously you.	Ekyo nga kirabika oli.
There seems to be no problem.	Kirabika tewali buzibu bwonna.
Not very good, really.	Si kirungi nnyo, ddala.
You can do that, my dear.	Ekyo osobola okukikola muganzi wange.
He did this.	Kino yakikola.
And we’re all there.	Era ffenna tuli awo.
Actually, that would be nice.	Mu butuufu, ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
I’ll be there with you, of course.	Nja kubeerawo naawe, ddala.
This is a common practice.	Eno nkola ya bulijjo.
We have a lot of it.	Tulina bingi.
I certainly will be!.	Mazima ddala nja kuba!.
You have everything.	Olina buli kimu.
Together, we can do it!.	Nga tuli wamu, tusobola okukikola!.
Really a little kid.	Ddala mwana muto.
He was alone at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali yekka.
As usual, he was working on a speech.	Nga bulijjo, yali akola ku kwogera.
It’s true, of course.	Kituufu, ddala.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
You do the same thing at this party.	Naawe okola kye kimu ne ku mbaga eno.
He needed to know what he needed to know.	Yali yeetaaga okumanya ebyo bye yali yeetaaga okumanya.
But it comes to .	Naye kijja ku .
But he had high expectations.	Naye yali asuubira bingi nnyo.
There is no concept of time and space.	Tewali ndowooza ya kiseera na kifo.
Then he said, we have to tell someone.	Awo n’agamba nti, tulina okubuulira omuntu.
All everything is in this room.	Byonna buli kimu kiri mu kisenge kino.
I'll agree.	Nja kukkiriza.
He agreed to do it.	Yakkiriza okukikola.
He needed to get out of this place.	Yali yeetaaga okuva mu kifo kino.
Like a dog.	Nga embwa.
It won’t be for long.	Tekijja kuba kya bbanga ddene.
And, of course, they are anything but.	Era, ddala, bali kintu kyonna naye.
He doesn't want me to know where.	Tayagala mmanyi wa.
He always prefers.	Bulijjo asinga kwagala.
Something he had to do.	Ekintu kye yalina okukola.
I really, really want to.	Ddala, ddala njagala.
No one could help.	Tewali yali asobola kuyamba.
He doesn’t want anything from either of us.	Talina ky’ayagala ku ffembi.
It was probably lucky.	Oboolyawo kyali kya mukisa.
I need to see my dad.	Nze nneetaaga okulaba taata wange.
He was good to me.	Yali mulungi gyendi.
I can make a picture.	Nsobola okukola ekifaananyi.
It’s not something you want to happen.	Si kintu ky’oyagala okubaawo.
Maybe no one knew who he was.	Mpozzi nga tewali yali amanyi ani.
Where it might have been.	We kyali kiyinza okuba nga kyali.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
He wanted to do everything.	Yali ayagala okukola buli kimu.
There is no haste.	Tewali bwangu.
I do think there is that thing.	Nze ndowooza nti waliwo ekintu ekyo.
He had no idea what to do.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna kya kukola.
I was afraid before.	Nali ntya emabegako.
It is important to do so.	Kikulu okukikola.
I was very sick.	Nnali mulwadde nnyo.
I think we all should.	Ndowooza ffenna tusaanidde.
This is not a good thing for us.	Kino si kintu kirungi gye tuli.
Back to the city.	Okudda mu kibuga.
This is a friendly place.	Kino kifo kya mukwano.
But you know you are sick.	Naye okimanyi nti oli mulwadde.
My wife works.	Mukyala wange akola.
But he wasn’t going to go.	Naye yali tagenda kugenda.
You probably know what that is too .	Oboolyawo naawe omanyi ekyo kye kiri .
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
We are each something always, all the time.	Buli omu tuli kintu bulijjo, buli kiseera.
No one is going to work.	Tewali agenda kukola.
He has no friends.	Talina mikwano.
Anyone can say whatever they want.	Omuntu yenna asobola okwogera kyonna ky’ayagala.
He will try.	Ajja kugezaako.
It’s really hard to say.	Ddala kizibu okwogera.
There he was, as usual.	Eyo gye yali, nga bulijjo.
I will, soon.	Nja kukikola, mu bbanga ttono.
It doesn't matter,	Si kikulu, .
What a lucky man he was.	Nga yali musajja wa mukisa.
No' my problem.	Nedda' ekizibu kyange.
And I know it won’t.	Era nkimanyi nti tekijja kukikola.
He said that he did not know.	Yagamba nti yali tamanyi.
He was a strong man.	Yali musajja wa maanyi.
Everything would be fine.	Buli kimu kyandibadde kirungi.
I could get here.	Nnali nsobola okutuuka wano.
And yes, it’s great.	Era ye, kirungi nnyo.
There is myself, and .	Waliwo nze kennyini, era .
I was actually happy.	Mu butuufu nnali musanyufu.
No one could, however.	Tewali yali asobola, naye.
Whatever you want.	Kyonna ky’oyagala.
It had to go away.	Kyalina okugenda.
And now this is who he is to us.	Era kati kino ky’ali gye tuli.
It was the way it was.	Yali ngeri gye kyali.
No, it was serious.	Nedda, kyali kya maanyi.
The problem is not easy.	Obuzibu si bwangu.
I do everything.	Nkola buli kimu.
Easy to say, but hard to do well.	Kyangu okwogera, naye kizibu okukola obulungi.
But that’s all he did.	Naye ekyo kyokka kye yakola.
He was thinking.	Yali alowooza.
Everything comes at a cost.	Buli kimu kijja ku ssente.
But that was me.	Naye oyo nnali nze.
But he doesn’t have it.	Naye talina.
He is always the reason.	Bulijjo ye nsonga.
I like to be busy.	Njagala nnyo okubeera bbize.
This is really important.	Kino ddala kikulu nnyo.
Nothing normal though.	Tewali kya bulijjo wadde.
A lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi.
No, they really are.	Nedda, ddala bwe bali.
He doesn’t even want to do it.	Tayagala wadde okukikola.
It’s actually worse than that.	Mu butuufu kibi okusinga ekyo.
I need all the time .	Nze nneetaaga buli kiseera .
It was a terrible time.	Kyali kiseera kibi nnyo.
Or was it .	Oba kyali .
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
He has only one picture.	Alina ekifaananyi kimu kyokka.
He knows that now.	Ekyo akimanyi kati.
And night comes too soon.	Era ekiro kijja mangu nnyo.
However, it will not be easy.	Kyokka, tekijja kuba kyangu.
You’ve already been there.	Obadde awo dda.
I really think you’re on to something.	Mazima ddala ndowooza nti oli ku kintu.
I want to be real.	Njagala kubeera wa ddala.
But he can’t stay.	Naye tasobola kusigala.
We will have to do it.	Tujja kuba tulina okukikola.
That was important to us.	Ekyo kyali kikulu gye tuli.
It was true at the time.	Kyali kituufu mu kiseera ekyo.
He was a very ordinary looking man.	Yali musajja alabika nga wa bulijjo nnyo.
And maybe, for a little while, you do.	Era mpozzi, okumala akaseera katono, okola.
But you will get another chance.	Naye ojja kufuna omukisa omulala.
It would be bad, Dad.	Kyandibadde kibi taata.
He shouldn’t do that.	Ekyo tasaanidde kukikola.
Nothing of the sort can really happen.	Tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo kiyinza kubaawo ddala.
Someone has to do it.	Omuntu alina okukikola.
I’m thinking about you.	Nze ndowooza ku ggwe.
Someone is going to do it.	Omuntu agenda okukikola.
It was just something.	Kyali kintu kyokka.
Even in prison.	Ne mu kkomera.
There is nothing like this.	Tewali kintu nga kino.
She actually looked great.	Mu butuufu yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
I knew nothing about that stuff.	Ebintu ebyo nnali simanyi kintu kyonna.
You’ve been working hard.	Obadde okola nnyo.
You are my son.	Ggwe mwana wange.
We are very strong .	Tuli ba maanyi nnyo .
What will happen will be.	Ekigenda okubaawo kijja kuba.
He doesn’t have a good one.	Talina mulungi.
I really have to go now.	Ddala nnina okugenda kati.
I wasn’t sure, of course.	Nze nnali sikakasa, ddala.
He seems to be everywhere today.	Alabika ali buli wamu leero.
Alone and hopeful.	Yekka era nga alina essuubi.
More than anyone else.	Okusinga omuntu yenna.
As it turned out, no.	Nga bwe kyali, nedda.
No one was home at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo tewali yali waka.
Not good, not bad.	Si kirungi, si kibi.
He is not here this afternoon.	Tali wano akawungeezi ka leero.
The average person can do it though.	Omuntu wa bulijjo asobola okukikola wadde.
Now it was my turn.	Kati kyali kiseera kyange.
You can’t do that.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola.
However, it is not.	Kyokka si bwe kiri.
You always have a plan.	Bulijjo olina enteekateeka.
But maybe they’re not.	Naye mpozzi si bwe bali.
Here I was in a lot of trouble.	Wano nnali mu buzibu bungi.
But not like us, of course.	Naye si nga ffe, ddala.
He thinks he is better than that.	Alowooza nti asinga ekyo.
There is no policy whatsoever.	Tewali nkola yonna.
He didn’t want to be alone again.	Yali tayagala kuddamu kubeera yekka.
But we have what we have.	Naye tulina bye tulina.
He is my son.	Ye mwana wange.
Now it would be nice.	Kati kyandibadde kirungi.
He couldn't believe he was in on this too.	Yali tayinza kukkiriza nti naye yali mu ku nsonga eno.
. . . .	.
I wanted to stay.	Nnali njagala kusigala.
It can be but not always.	Kiyinza okuba naye si bulijjo.
But that’s not the point here.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga wano.
Money is nothing.	Ssente si kintu.
He did everything right.	Buli kimu yakikola bulungi.
He already had it.	Yalina dda.
Nothing just now.	Tewali kintu kyonna kati kyokka.
He can’t say who.	Tasobola kwogera ani.
I thought he already knew.	Nalowooza nti yali amanyi dda.
This book was exactly the same.	Ekitabo kino kyali kye kimu ddala.
But he is sick.	Naye mulwadde.
That’s how he could.	Bw’atyo bwe yali asobola.
I'm not sure why it was down.	Sikakasa lwaki kyali wansi.
But very well.	Naye bulungi nnyo.
Then you are mine.	Awo oli wange.
But not immediately.	Naye si mu bwangu.
He thought he was doing the right thing.	Yalowooza nti yali akola kituufu.
But he had no choice.	Naye yali talina kya kukola.
However, this is probably not the case.	Kyokka, oboolyawo kino si bwe kiri.
You have to move on.	Olina okugenda mu maaso.
This, he admitted, was a very good thing.	Kino, yakkiriza nti kyali kintu kirungi nnyo.
You can answer.	Oyinza okuddamu.
Not my father.	Si taata wange.
I thought it would work.	Nalowooza nti yandikoze.
He hadn’t spoken yet.	Yali tannaba kwogera.
Surely, you know you are a good teacher.	Mazima ddala, okimanyi nti oli musomesa mulungi.
We are everywhere.	Tuli buli wamu.
He went to school a lot.	Yagenda nnyo ku ssomero.
We’ll do it there.	Tujja kukikola awo.
I was at school.	Nnali ku ssomero.
They are not real.	Si ba ddala.
But now maybe he won't.	Naye kati mpozzi tajja kukikola.
We can now do this.	Kino kati tusobola okukikola.
But tonight he doesn’t need her help.	Naye ekiro kino teyeetaaga buyambi bwe.
Even now it was in the same place.	Ne kati kyali mu kifo kye kimu.
Almost nothing.	Kumpi si kintu kyonna.
It will just stay there until morning.	Kijja kumala kusigala awo okutuusa ku makya.
I know it’s a serious issue.	Nkimanyi nti nsonga ya maanyi.
I know how hard it is here.	Nkimanyi engeri gye kizibu wano.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange asinga.
But it’s hard, living here.	Naye kizibu, okubeera wano.
It is right behind.	Kiri emabega ddala.
That was my point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga yange.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nnali simanyi kiki.
He didn’t have to do this.	Kino yali talina kukikola.
I want to do this myself, now.	Kino njagala kukikola nze kennyini, kati.
He knew where he was.	Yali amanyi gye yali.
And so does my father.	Era ne taata bw’atyo bw’atyo.
But anything can happen.	Naye ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo.
Perhaps it could be.	Oboolyawo kiyinza okuba nga.
He knows where he went.	Amanyi gye yagenda.
We can’t do it again.	Tetusobola kuddamu kukikola.
You said that .	Wagamba nti .
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
I think it was great.	Ndowooza kyali kirungi nnyo.
I have something to say.	Nnina kye nnina okwogera.
Apparently that would be too easy.	Kirabika ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
That’s what I want for you.	Ekyo kye njagala gyoli.
He would have fallen asleep.	Yandibadde yeebase.
Maybe he's just a friend.	Mpozzi mukwano gwe yekka.
Maybe more than he needed.	Mpozzi okusinga bwe yali yeetaaga.
You, not	Ggwe, si .
I'll be fine.	Nja kuba bulungi.
Or so he believed.	Oba bwatyo bwe yakkiriza.
You are so lucky to have me as a friend.	Oli wa mukisa nnyo okubeera nange nga mukwano gwange.
I’m that I’m not that.	Nze ekyo siri ekyo.
Not happy with.	Si musanyufu ne.
It was really powerful.	Ddala kyali kya maanyi.
He was either at work or asleep.	Yali ku mulimu oba nga yeebase.
You are just a human being.	Oli muntu yekka.
You’re not alone.	Si ggwe wekka.
It’s my time.	Kye kiseera kyange.
You are the reason why.	Ggwe ensonga lwaki.
That’s not always easy.	Ekyo si kyangu bulijjo.
It is not	Si bwe kiri .
Why was this there.	Lwaki kino kyali awo.
He did much more than that.	Yakola bingi okusinga ekyo.
And there is no good plan.	Era tewali nteekateeka nnungi.
You knew this.	Kino wali okimanyi.
We are though.	Ffe tuli wadde.
He loves it as well.	Ayagala nnyo nga bwe kiri.
For me, it was.	Nze, bwe kyali.
He didn’t think they were.	Yali talowooza nti bwe bali.
You can .	Osobola .
ME? 	NZE?
The guy was sick.	Ggaayi yali mulwadde.
That doesn’t seem to be the case here.	Ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri wano.
I’m what I need.	Nze kye nneetaaga.
I don’t know what to say about this.	Simanyi kya kwogera ku nsonga eno.
I certainly have.	Mazima ddala nnina.
I have something on.	Nnina ekintu kye nfunye ku.
I know there’s nothing there.	Nkimanyi nti tewali kintu kyonna awo.
You probably know who does it.	Oboolyawo omanyi ani akikola.
I need to talk to you.	Nnina okwogera naawe.
And you’re the best person at the job.	Era ggwe omuntu asinga obulungi ku mulimu.
That was sudden.	Ekyo kyali kya mangu.
We will be friends.	Tujja kuba ba mukwano.
I want to talk about that.	Njagala okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
It was actually quite accurate .	Mu butuufu kyali kituufu nnyo .
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
I’ll admit it was hard.	Nja kukkiriza nti kyali kizibu.
He wanted to, plainly.	Yali ayagala, mu lwatu.
But it was difficult.	Naye kyali kizibu.
I'm there for you.	Nze ndi awo.
It doesn’t seem romantic.	Kirabika nga si kya mukwano.
However, doing this well is not easy.	Kyokka kino okukola obulungi si kyangu.
He probably has a reason.	Oboolyawo alina ensonga lwaki.
Maybe we’re going to be okay.	Mpozzi tugenda kuba bulungi.
You’re doing well.	Okola bulungi.
It was a huge risk.	Kyali kya bulabe bwa maanyi nnyo.
That will be .	Ekyo kijja kuba .
You know, early on.	Omanyi, nga bukyali.
But only you know that.	Naye ekyo ggwe wekka akimanyi.
I am a car man, not a money man.	Ndi musajja wa mmotoka, siri musajja wa ssente.
It will be wonderful.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
Low but not too low.	Wansi naye si wansi nnyo.
We have an agenda.	Tulina agenda.
. . . .	.
Perhaps he prayed too.	Oboolyawo naye yasaba.
But no, it is very powerful.	Naye nedda, kya maanyi nnyo.
I will go home too.	Nange nja kudda eka.
He is the best we have.	Ye asinga gwe tulina.
He said that he had.	Yagamba nti yalina.
But that’s his point.	Naye eyo nsonga ye.
I doubt it will know.	Nbuusabuusa nti kijja kumanya.
It is very good to read.	Kirungi nnyo okusoma.
Why would he .	Lwaki yandibadde .
I would love to be one.	Njagala nnyo okubeera omu.
a.	omu.
He was really hopeful.	Ddala yalina essuubi.
He knew the reason better than anyone.	Ensonga yali amanyi bulungi okusinga omuntu yenna.
And maybe that was the point.	Era mpozzi eyo ye yali ensonga.
He was thinking.	Yali alowooza.
And, of course, that was true.	Era, kya lwatu, ekyo kyali kituufu.
He is much stronger.	Asinga nnyo amaanyi.
There is nothing to see.	Tewali kya kulaba.
This is the problem though.	Kino kye kizibu wadde.
And of course there is.	Era ddala waliwo.
Most likely not.	Okusinga si bwe kiri.
He does what he wants to do.	Akola ky’ayagala okukola.
This is difficult and dangerous.	Kino kizibu era kya bulabe.
He is still a very dangerous man.	Akyali musajja wa bulabe nnyo.
There really is no time.	Mazima ddala tewali budde.
You are just like him.	Ggwe oli nga ye yekka.
But nothing serious so far.	Naye tewali kintu kya maanyi okutuusa kati.
This is certainly the case.	Kino mazima ddala bwe kiri.
Terrible.	Kibi.
However, I cannot see.	Kyokka sisobola kulaba.
We are going to be together for a very long time.	Tugenda kubeera wamu okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
Indeed, of course.	Mazima ddala, ddala.
And it will be true.	Era kijja kuba kituufu.
I have been lucky.	Nze mbadde wa mukisa.
But, that’s neither here nor there.	Naye, ekyo si wano wadde awo.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
It’s there all the time.	Buli awo buli kiseera.
Now was the moment.	Kati kye kyali akaseera.
I am right now my son.	Nze ndi mu kiseera kino mwana wange.
Just my wife.	Mukyala wange yekka.
He doesn’t, not at all.	Talina, si bwe kiri n’akatono.
That was important to me.	Ekyo kyali kikulu gyendi.
You were his best friend.	Ggwe wali mukwano gwe asinga.
This is where the problem lies.	Wano obuzibu we buli.
In excellent condition.	Mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
This doesn’t even come close.	Kino tekijja na kubeera kumpi.
It’s really easy though.	Ddala kyangu wadde.
The only person.	Omuntu yekka.
That’s right there.	Ekyo kiri awo kituufu.
As it was, it was important.	Nga bwe kyali, kyali kikulu.
You have been	Obadde .
He is not very sick.	Si mulwadde nnyo.
There is a problem.	Waliwo obuzibu.
That you are not alone.	Nti si ggwe wekka.
I didn’t know what to do about it.	Nnali simanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo.
You’ve always been.	Bulijjo obadde.
I probably won’t have time.	Oboolyawo sijja kufuna budde.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
He didn’t know you were his son.	Yali tamanyi nti oli mwana we.
Everyone’s father went.	Taata wa buli muntu yagenda.
But that won’t happen much of the time.	Naye ekyo tekijja kubaawo budde bungi.
Everyone knew and no one did anything.	Buli omu yali amanyi era tewali yakola kintu kyonna.
He still couldn’t believe it, but it was true.	Yali n’okutuusa kati yali tasobola kukkiriza, naye kyali kituufu.
But it was good.	Naye kyali kirungi.
Everything was happening so fast.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
I can do this.	Kino nsobola okukikola.
He can’t even speak.	Tasobola na kwogera.
Certainly not anything.	Mazima ddala si kintu kyonna.
Then, of course, he did.	Awo, kya lwatu, yakikola.
And he should have.	Era yandibadde.
What he plans to do now.	Kye ateekateeka okukola kati.
For him, it was a big deal.	Ku ye, kyali kikulu nnyo.
That might actually happen here.	Ekyo mu butuufu kiyinza okubaawo wano.
But he hits hard.	Naye akuba nnyo.
And he's there.	Era ali awo.
It was really absolutely true.	Ddala kyali kituufu ddala.
Don’t go downstairs.	Togenda wansi.
You’ll see if that’s the case.	Ojja kulaba oba ekyo bwe kiri.
We were busy.	Twali bbize.
And yet, it is very much the same.	Era naye, kye kimu nnyo.
You don’t have to stay.	Tolina kusigala.
I feel like you’re close.	Mpulira nga oli kumpi.
Or he thought he did.	Oba yalowooza nti yakikola.
He said that was good.	Yagamba nti ekyo kirungi.
My father was there.	Taata yali awo.
Although, if the reason.	Wadde, singa ensonga.
I hear, you have.	Mpulira, olina.
What a thought.	Nga ndowooza ki.
Not because of the system.	Si lwa nkola.
Maybe they were, but they certainly aren’t now.	Mpozzi nga baali, naye mazima ddala kati si bwe bali.
These things are hard work.	Ebintu bino mulimu gwa maanyi.
There is no help whatsoever.	Tewali buyambi bwonna.
It’s not something like that.	Si kintu ng’ekyo.
They were always friends.	Bulijjo baali ba mukwano.
I want to do everything with you.	Njagala okukola naawe buli kimu.
I’m going as usual.	Nze ngenda nga bulijjo.
I couldn’t even speak.	Nnali sisobola na kwogera.
That’s what he wants.	Ekyo ayagala.
What are we supposed to do.	Tulina kukola ki.
Which he loves to say.	Kye ayagala nnyo okwogera.
Either way, it’s hard to say what will happen.	Mu ngeri yonna, kizibu okwogera ekigenda okubaawo.
I don’t know why anyone would do that.	Simanyi lwaki waliwo omuntu yenna yandikoze ekyo.
The point of all this .	Ensonga ya bino byonna .
I am not sure when he left.	Sikakasa ddi lwe yagenda.
He was really nice and friendly about it.	Ddala yali mulungi era wa mukwano ku nsonga eyo.
That was the problem.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
Maybe it doesn’t matter what it was.	Mpozzi si kikulu kye kyali.
That’s what he told me.	Ekyo yang’amba.
No, it’s really quite simple.	Nedda, ddala kyangu nnyo.
It certainly was the case with me.	Mazima ddala bwe kyali ku nze.
I honestly can’t talk now.	Mu butuufu sisobola kwogera kati.
He should have known better.	Yandibadde asinga okumanya.
I am good in school.	Ndi mulungi mu ssomero.
He was in school at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali mu ssomero.
But of course, no.	Naye ddala, nedda.
I don’t know, myself.	Simanyi, nze kennyini.
My girlfriend told me so.	Muganzi wange yang’amba bw’atyo.
I don’t like this.	Kino sikyagala.
He talked a lot about you.	Yayogera nnyo ku ggwe.
I want to do it tonight.	Njagala kukikola ekiro kino.
He works very, very hard.	Akola nnyo nnyo.
Either way, not here now.	Mu ngeri yonna, si wano kati.
No one looked better than anyone else.	Tewali yali alabika bulungi okusinga omuntu omulala yenna.
And it can happen today.	Era kiyinza okubaawo leero.
It’s not easy and it’s not easy.	Si kyangu era si kyangu.
I belong in this room .	Nze ndi wa mu kisenge kino .
I doubt that will happen.	Nbuusabuusa nti ekyo kijja kubaawo.
You know this is not true.	Kino okimanyi nti si kituufu.
Nothing could be more obvious.	Tewali kiyinza kuba kya lwatu okusinga ekyo.
How important it seems.	Nga kirabika nga kikulu nnyo.
In theory, however,.	Kyokka mu ndowooza,...
However, I can’t.	Kyokka sisobola.
I was just a kid at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali mwana muto yekka.
But that’s not quite right.	Naye ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
I will never do something like this again.	Sijja kuddamu kukola kintu nga kino.
And that’s what’s happening.	Era ekyo kye kigenda mu maaso.
It may be true for you too.	Naawe kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
Today he's going to spend here.	Leero agenda kumala wano.
I don’t like that about my job.	Ekyo sikyagala ku mulimu gwange.
The other couldn’t even do that.	Omulala ekyo yali tasobola na kukikola.
This was a good class for me.	Kino kyali kibiina kirungi gyendi.
I feel pretty good too.	Nze nange mpulira bulungi nnyo.
He is very good to me.	Mulungi nnyo gyendi.
He looks happy.	Alabika musanyufu.
You know, same as always.	Omanyi, kye kimu nga bulijjo.
That wasn’t all he did.	Ekyo si kye kyokka kye yakola.
Tomorrow it will be you.	Enkya kijja kuba ggwe.
This was much harder than he expected.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo okusinga bwe yali asuubira.
And no, that’s not the reason.	Era nedda, eyo si y’ensonga lwaki.
He wishes he could have been.	Ayagala nnyo okuba nga yandibadde.
He is the only guy.	Ye ggaayi yekka.
But it’s not this.	Naye si kino.
I wanted to find a way to survive.	Nnali njagala kufuna ngeri gye nnyinza kubeerawo.
And he knew it.	Era yali akimanyi.
I wanted to know why.	Nnali njagala okumanya ensonga lwaki.
That’s all he got.	Ekyo kyokka kye yafuna.
It is there in everything.	Kiri awo mu buli kimu.
Not really at all.	Si ddala n’akatono.
We need to talk.	Twetaaga okwogera.
It’s just not true.	Si mazima kyokka.
Just as quickly.	Nga bwe kiri mu bwangu.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
I love the challenge.	Njagala nnyo obuzibu.
Perhaps it was him too.	Oboolyawo naye yali ye.
That's you.	Oyo ggwe.
And, of course, it had.	Era, ddala, kyalina.
You're not with me.	Toli nange.
He said that was true.	Yagambye nti ekyo kituufu.
Everywhere we go.	Buli we tugenda.
That's what it looks like, to me.	Ekyo kye kirabika, gyendi.
You can do this in many ways.	Kino osobola okukikola mu ngeri nnyingi.
I just think it’s good.	Nze ndowooza kyokka nti kirungi.
I’m thinking a lot.	Nze ndowooza nnyo.
Below is a picture.	Wansi waliwo ekifaananyi.
He wanted to be near me.	Yali ayagala kubeera kumpi nange.
He knew what he was doing.	Yali amanyi kye yali akola.
It’s very important here.	Kikulu nnyo wano.
We’ll do it there.	Tujja kukikola eyo.
You think you can do whatever you want.	Olowooza osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
Thus doing nothing.	Bw’atyo obutakola kintu kyonna.
I live alone here.	Wano mbeera nze nzekka.
Or a beautiful one.	Oba omulungi.
Not for long, though.	Kyokka si lwa bbanga ddene.
We are at work.	Tuli ku mulimu.
It is what it is though.	Kye kiri wadde.
Not to himself.	Si eri ye kennyini.
But maybe he will.	Naye mpozzi ajja kukikola.
It certainly was.	Mazima ddala bwe kyali.
This is not too difficult.	Kino si kizibu nnyo.
We’ll just talk about ourselves.	Tujja kumala kwogera ku ffe.
He didn’t really want to talk.	Yali tayagala nnyo kwogera.
He had no desire to eat anything.	Yali talina ky’ayagala kulya kintu kyonna.
He is not ordinary.	Si wa bulijjo.
I have to say this.	Kino nnina okwogera.
But he couldn’t do that either.	Naye ekyo naye yali tasobola kukikola.
It doesn’t matter what it is.	Si kikulu kiki kye kiri.
And that may be true.	Era ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
I love the picture.	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi.
We can deliver.	Tusobola okutuusa.
Everything was very difficult.	Buli kimu kyali kizibu nnyo.
At the time, anyway.	Mu kiseera ekyo, mu ngeri yonna.
He couldn’t eat.	Yali tasobola kulya.
But this isn’t just any place.	Naye kino si kifo kyonna kyokka.
For a moment, no one spoke.	Okumala akaseera katono, tewali yayogera.
This is in his best interest.	Kino kiri mu bulungi bwe.
That would be very difficult.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka kino si kituufu.
It seems important to you though.	Kirabika kikulu gy’oli wadde.
He didn’t want to talk about it.	Yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
But it was true.	Naye kyali kituufu.
This feels right to me.	Kino mpulira nga kituufu gyendi.
I can’t believe it.	Siyinza kukkiriza.
Whenever that would be.	Buli ekyo lwe kyandibadde.
I am not alone either.	Nange siri nzekka.
I'll go.	Nja kugenda.
But this picture is very, very simple.	Naye ekifaananyi kino kyangu nnyo nnyo.
Apparently everyone knew.	Kirabika buli omu yali akimanyi.
He can and will be strong in expressing his opinions.	Asobola era ajja kuba wa maanyi mu kwogera endowooza ze.
But that's what.	Naye ekyo kye ki...
For her, it’s time to get back to work.	Eri ye, kye kiseera okudda ku mulimu.
There is that attitude.	Waliwo endowooza eyo.
This is really a bad idea.	Kino ddala kirowoozo kibi.
I need money very, very much.	Nze nneetaaga ssente nnyo nnyo.
However, here it is.	Kyokka, wano we wali.
But it was normal.	Naye nga kya bulijjo.
I always wanted one.	Bulijjo nnali njagala emu.
You’ll see.	Ojja kulaba.
It's down, down.	Kiri wansi, wansi.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
And everyone had that.	Era buli omu yalina ekyo.
You don’t have the money.	Tolina ssente.
Every day, in fact.	Buli lunaku, mu butuufu.
No, we can’t do that.	Nedda, ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
It seems like you’ve always been here.	Kirabika bulijjo obadde wano.
He is very well.	Ali bulungi nnyo.
We were both in a very low mood.	Ffembi twali mu mbeera ya wansi nnyo.
He told me so himself.	Ye kennyini yang’amba bw’atyo.
Something like him.	Ekintu nga ye.
I live here for a long time.	Nze mbeera wano okumala ebbanga ddene.
I'll be back soon.	Nja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
And back home on the bus.	Era okudda eka mu bbaasi.
I am sick.	Ndi mulwadde.
I’ve been working there.	Nze mbadde nkola eyo.
I don’t want you either.	Saagala naawe.
From here to there.	Okuva wano okutuuka eyo.
I really want to talk to you.	Nze njagala nnyo okwogera naawe.
I was as usual early.	Nali nga bulijjo nga bukyali.
I couldn’t speak.	Nnali sisobola kwogera.
Everyone went away.	Buli omu yagenda.
That was true, as far as it went.	Ekyo kyali kituufu, okutuuka we kyali.
That doesn’t matter.	Ekyo si nsonga.
And that’s not a good thing.	Era ekyo si kintu kirungi.
He's probably fine.	Oboolyawo ali bulungi.
He got what he wanted.	Yafuna ky’ayagala.
I’m sorry, of course.	Nsonyiwa, ddala.
It’s not good for them.	Si kirungi gye bali.
That probably wasn’t the case.	Ekyo osanga nga si bwe kyali.
The thing is that.	Ekintu kiri nti.
He is very, very curious about me.	Ayagala nnyo nnyo okumanya gyendi.
Apparently this was not the case.	Kirabika kino si bwe kyali.
He felt something he wanted.	Yawulira ekintu kye yali ayagala.
Really, really bad.	Ddala, ddala kibi.
I love spending time with him.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye obudde.
As much as we can.	Nga bwe tusobola.
This is a common issue.	Eno nsonga ya bulijjo.
You know that better than anyone.	Ekyo okimanyi okusinga omuntu yenna.
It is not for the present.	Si kya kiseera kino.
He was the other guy.	Ye yali ggaayi omulala.
And my brother is sick.	Era muganda wange mulwadde.
She looked good, she said.	Yalabika bulungi, bwe yagambye.
The food is good.	Emmere nnungi.
We were fine.	Twali bulungi.
It was a great time for us.	Kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo gye tuli.
He does it	Akikola .
I’m not sure he really wants to be there.	Sikakasa nti ddala ayagala kubeerawo.
Of course, everyone does.	Kya lwatu nti buli muntu akikola.
Of course now, of course.	Kya lwatu kati, ddala.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
But not really.	Naye si ddala.
I love it now.	Njagala nnyo kati.
You don’t have to do this.	Kino tolina kukikola.
This may be .	Kino kiyinza okuba nga .
I couldn’t do anything about that.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
It was his idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kye.
It’s pretty much the way it is right now.	Kirungi nnyo engeri gye kiri mu kiseera kino.
I know what to expect.	Nze mmanyi kye nsuubira.
He knew now what was going to happen.	Yali amanyi kati ekigenda okubaawo.
And you will be .	Era ojja kuba .
Now he was behind me.	Kati yali emabega wange.
It was	Yali .
I am young and strong.	Ndi muto era wa maanyi.
He told me he would talk to her.	Yang’amba nti agenda kwogera naye.
That’s the time to go.	Ekyo kye kiseera okugenda.
He must be alone.	Ateekwa okuba nga yekka.
You can be that with me.	Osobola okuba ekyo nange.
What could it be? 	Kiyinza okuba nga ki?
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
And he was in very good shape indeed.	Era yali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo ddala.
My father knew that my brother needed my father’s time as well.	Taata yali akimanyi nti muganda wange yali yeetaaga obudde bwa taata naye.
I'll have to go to work now.	Nja kuba nnina okugenda ku mulimu kati.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
I was so excited.	Nnali musanyufu nnyo.
I will do my job.	Nja kukola omulimu gwange.
It is a very good organization.	Kibiina kirungi nnyo.
That's why you're here.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki oli wano.
Maybe you’re lucky.	Mpozzi olina omukisa.
Something I noticed this morning.	Ekintu kye nfunye enkya ya leero.
That something is bad.	Nti ekintu kibi.
But he should have done the same.	Naye naye yandibadde akola kye kimu.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
There is only you and me.	Waliwo nze naawe ffekka.
That seems complicated.	Ekyo kirabika nga kizibu.
Or you can do this .	Oba kino osobola okukikola .
It’s not my job.	Si mulimu gwange.
Maybe it’s too common.	Mpozzi nga kya bulijjo nnyo.
He did very well.	Yakola bulungi nnyo.
I’ve got all the time we need.	Nfunye obudde bwonna bwe twetaaga.
But, it wasn’t.	Naye, si bwe kyali.
You can talk.	Osobola okwogera.
This is a good thing for almost everyone.	Kino kintu kirungi kumpi eri buli muntu.
And that was a very good thing.	Era ekyo kyali kintu kirungi nnyo.
I can’t go on.	Sisobola kugenda mu maaso.
And at the time that was very important.	Era mu kiseera ekyo ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
My wife was in that situation.	Mukyala wange yali mu mbeera eyo.
There was no way he couldn’t.	Tewali ngeri gye yali tasobola.
Not as bad, but it looks pretty bad.	Si kibi nga, naye kirabika kibi nnyo.
I need to work .	Nze nneetaaga okukola .
And maybe this is a good thing.	Era mpozzi kino kintu kirungi.
But now it doesn’t matter to me.	Naye kati si kikulu gyendi.
And he has a plan.	Era alina enteekateeka.
You have to know what you want.	Olina okumanya ky’oyagala.
He must eat.	Ateekwa okulya.
He said he could read.	Yagambye nti asobola okusoma.
To know something about the man .	Okumanya ekintu ku musajja oyo .
But no, no, no.	Naye nedda nedda nedda.
And food, obviously.	Era emmere, kya lwatu.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
. . . .	.
Everything looks much better now.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi nnyo kati.
Or the father.	Oba taata.
But that’s not what matters.	Naye ekyo si kye kikulu.
I don’t want anything.	Nze sirina kye njagala.
Not in any sense.	Si mu nsonga yonna.
This is where we need to be.	Wano we twetaaga okubeera.
Now, no one knows.	Kati, tewali amanyi.
It was what she needed to talk to him about.	Kye yali yeetaaga okwogera naye.
I know there is one below.	Nkimanyi nti wansi waliwo emu.
There is no time now.	Tewali budde kati.
This really is .	Kino ddala kiri nti .
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
Not just yet.	Si kyokka n’okutuusa kati.
All in time together.	Byonna mu budde nga tuli wamu.
It was very easy to do.	Kyali kyangu nnyo okukola.
He is beautiful.	Ye mulungi.
I know he is happy.	Nkimanyi nti musanyufu.
I have always been able to.	Bulijjo mbadde nsobola.
And at the time it was really good.	Era mu kiseera ekyo ddala kyali kirungi.
This comes every week.	Kino kijja buli wiiki.
Here we come together.	Wano tujja wamu.
It’s not always practical to do this, of course.	Si bulijjo nti kya nkola okukola kino, ddala.
But he came alone.	Naye yajja yekka.
That's his whole point.	Eyo y'ensonga ye yonna.
He expects you to go talk to him.	Asuubira nti ojja kugenda okwogera naye.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Tewali kizibu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I hope he is not sick.	Nsuubira nti si mulwadde.
Whenever you would like to get here.	Buli lwe wandyagadde okutuuka wano.
I’ve been working.	Mbadde nkola.
But it doesn’t seem to be.	Naye kirabika si bwe kiri.
There is a problem.	Waliwo ekizibu.
He may not be.	Ayinza okuba nga nedda.
He must do it.	Ateekwa okukikola.
I was well and happy, and busy.	Nali bulungi era nga ndi musanyufu, era nga ndi bbize.
He is a human being.	Ye muntu.
You are a process.	Oli nkola.
This is happening for a reason.	Kino kigenda mu maaso lwa nsonga.
There is no one.	Tewali muntu yenna.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
He was at school with me.	Yali ku ssomero nange.
But there is a problem.	Naye waliwo obuzibu.
It's a little true.	Kituufu katono.
That’s not really what it was.	Ekyo si kye kyali ddala.
He went right down.	Yagenda wansi ddala.
I know that, too.	Ekyo nange nkimanyi.
We can do this.	Kino tusobola okukikola.
That’s not the same thing at all.	Ekyo si kintu kye kimu n’akatono.
She has .	Ye alina .
It was mine.	Yali wange.
But, please .	Naye, nsaba .
It’s probably a problem.	Oboolyawo kizibu.
It’s better not to.	Kirungi obutakola.
I don’t want trouble.	Saagala buzibu.
What he heard.	Kye yawulira.
That was really good.	Ekyo kyali kirungi ddala.
He's going to talk.	Agenda kwogera.
This is not the case here.	Kino si bwe kiri wano.
I think it was mine.	Ndowooza kyali kyange.
I don’t want to go home.	Saagala kudda waka.
He still wasn’t.	Yali n’okutuusa kati si bwe yali.
He loves it there.	Ayagala nnyo eyo.
I thought you wouldn’t come back.	Nalowooza nti tojja kudda.
What a difficult experience it was.	Nga kyali kizibu nnyo.
I should have gone.	Nze wandibadde ngenda.
He had a lot.	Yalina bingi.
Only he wanted it more than I did.	Ye yekka ye yali ayagala okusinga nze.
I can’t do this.	Kino sisobola kukikola.
Everything was as it was.	Buli kimu kyali nga bwe kyali.
He had been thinking the very same thing.	Yali abadde alowooza ekintu kye kimu ennyo.
There is plenty of time for that.	Ekyo waliwo obudde bungi.
But it’s really hard.	Naye ddala kizibu.
One guy on each side.	Ggaayi omu ku buli ludda.
He'll be fine back there for a while.	Ajja kuba bulungi emabega awo okumala akaseera.
He said he would talk to me again.	Yagamba nti ajja kuddamu okwogera nange.
He won't know anything about it.	Tajja kumanya kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
It could be anyone, he thought.	Yandiba nga waliwo omuntu yenna, bwe yalowooza.
Everything was great.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi nnyo.
No one knows what they are.	Tewali amanyi kye bali.
He would be alone back there.	Yandibadde yekka emabega awo.
I doubt they really were both.	Nbuusabuusa nti ddala baali bombi.
Though not immediately.	Wadde nga si mu bwangu.
You just have to be you, to be yourself.	Olina okuba ggwe kyokka, okubeera ggwe kennyini.
You already have one.	Olina dda emu.
I can’t do anything about that.	Ekyo sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
She is a very nice lady.	Mukyala mulungi nnyo.
I am not sure about this.	Sikakasa ku kino.
It is very	Buli nnyo .
He had to go early.	Yalina okugenda nga bukyali.
Maybe it won’t be too bad.	Mpozzi tekijja kuba kibi nnyo.
My younger brother was the usual one.	Muto wange ye yali wa bulijjo.
He speaks a little too fast.	Ayogera mangu nnyo katono.
He is indeed very fortunate.	Mazima ddala wa mukisa nnyo.
Or not out of love.	Oba si lwa kwagala.
No one needs to see.	Tewali yeetaaga kulaba.
I just want to get this right.	Njagala kufuna kino kituufu kyokka.
Now to do this thing.	Kati okukola ekintu kino.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
He didn't know why.	Yali tamanyi lwaki.
And almost anyone can say anything.	Era kumpi omuntu yenna asobola okwogera ekintu kyonna.
Everyone has everything.	Buli muntu alina buli kimu.
And apparently, it was a big deal.	Era kirabika, kyali kikulu nnyo.
More than he could.	Okusinga bwe yali asobola.
But what is this .	Naye kino kiki .
But one could not have everything.	Naye omuntu yali tasobola kuba na buli kimu.
I’m going to get one.	Ngenda kufuna emu.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
Everything is on schedule.	Buli kimu kiri ku nteekateeka.
But you will know.	Naye ojja kumanya.
I’m doing pretty well.	Nze nkola bulungi nnyo.
And it’s not hard to see why.	Era si kizibu kulaba lwaki.
But he asked why.	Naye yabuuza lwaki.
You really can’t do this thing.	Mazima ddala tosobola kukola kintu kino.
If only he were good.	Singa yali mulungi.
And it’s a great idea.	Era kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
He said he didn't have to, but he might.	Yagamba nti talina, naye ayinza.
He has everything here.	Alina buli kimu wano.
No one knew anything for sure.	Tewali yali amanyi kintu kyonna kituufu.
I will try this.	Kino nja kugezaako.
There is no time now.	Tewali budde kati.
But it was real.	Naye kyali kya ddala.
But it’s hard not.	Naye kizibu si bwe kiri.
He lives alone.	Abeera yekka.
I'm going to go home.	Ngenda kudda eka.
He should have had it that way.	Yandibadde alina bw’atyo.
But this is very important.	Naye kino kikulu nnyo.
I was good, very good for a very long time.	Nali mulungi, mulungi nnyo okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
Not that he thought he needed to.	Si nti yali alowooza nti yali yeetaaga.
But they were very much together.	Naye baali wamu nnyo.
One down, three to go.	Omu wansi, ssatu okugenda.
It’s hard to come back from that.	Kizibu okudda okuva mu ekyo.
You have to get there.	Olina okutuuka eyo.
I am not dangerous.	Siri wa bulabe.
It was a beautiful office.	Yali ofiisi nnungi nnyo.
No house at all.	Tewali nnyumba n’akatono.
They are there with you.	Bali awo naawe.
I am a human being too.	Nange ndi muntu.
It’s not a temporary one.	Si kya kiseera kyonna.
He comes closer.	Ajja kumpi.
Not only that, but you can do it much faster.	Si ekyo kyokka, naye osobola okukikola amangu ennyo.
Today and every day from now on.	Leero ne buli lunaku okuva kati.
Then, it was everyone.	Awo, kyali buli muntu.
I hope he is okay.	Nsuubira nti ali bulungi.
My wife will be too.	Mukyala wange naye ajja kuba.
The police did, anyway.	Poliisi yakikola, mu ngeri yonna.
You have the power.	Olina amaanyi.
I was in the office one weekend.	Nali mu ofiisi ku wiikendi emu.
That was probably a bad idea.	Ekyo oboolyawo kyali kirowoozo kibi.
He was alone there.	Yali yekka eyo.
I guess no one does.	Ntebereza tewali akola.
There's a chance it's not true.	Waliwo omukisa nti si kituufu.
This product is excellent.	Ekintu kino kirungi nnyo.
Everything looks good.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi.
You can’t do it here.	Tosobola kukikola wano.
He couldn’t see clearly.	Yali tasobola kulaba bulungi.
But that’s what it is now.	Naye ekyo kye kiri kati.
He shouldn’t do this.	Kino tasaanidde kukikola.
That’s up to you.	Ekyo kiri ku ggwe.
But we could see it was going to happen.	Naye twali tusobola okulaba nti kyali kigenda kubaawo.
He was very friendly.	Yali wa mukwano nnyo.
We need to get back to that mindset.	Twetaaga okudda ku ndowooza eyo.
Just dinner.	Ekyeggulo kyokka.
There is no reason.	Tewali nsonga yonna.
But here’s the problem.	Naye wano waliwo obuzibu.
Not always always, but very nearly always always.	Si bulijjo bulijjo, naye kumpi nnyo bulijjo bulijjo.
He was always happy.	Yali musanyufu buli kiseera.
But he knew it was normal.	Naye yali akimanyi nti kyali kya bulijjo.
That wasn’t the issue.	Eyo si ye yali ensonga.
This is really important.	Kino kikulu nnyo ddala.
To be herself again.	Okuddamu okubeera ye kennyini.
But in reality, it is not.	Naye mu butuufu, si bwe kiri.
Probably an hour.	Oboolyawo essaawa emu.
He tries to speak, and nothing comes.	Agezaako okwogera, era tewali kijja.
But that was a serious situation.	Naye eyo yali mbeera ya maanyi nnyo.
That seems to be the truth.	Ekyo kirabika kye kituufu.
He couldn’t wait to find out the truth.	Yali tasobola kulinda kumanya mazima.
It is indeed very difficult and difficult.	Mazima ddala kizibu nnyo era kizibu nnyo.
And he may.	Era ayinza.
Night seems like a good time for that.	Ekiro kirabika kiseera kirungi eri ekyo.
Something we have to do.	Ekintu kye tulina okukola.
Certainly not the same thing.	Mazima ddala si kintu kye kimu.
That was all he was.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali.
But you can’t.	Naye tosobola.
My brother and I were.	Nze ne muganda wange twali.
The same will happen here.	Wano kye kimu kijja kubaawo.
He didn't know what to do.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola.
You have my brother with you.	Olina muganda wange naawe.
However, it is good.	Kyokka, kirungi.
Here we are right now.	Wano we tuli mu kiseera kino.
No one seemed to know what to do.	Tewali yali alabika amanyi kya kukola.
He thought he could do it.	Yalowooza nti asobola okukikola.
He knew it wasn’t him.	Yali akimanyi nti si ye.
There is no time.	Tewali budde.
And we will do that.	Era ekyo tujja kukikola.
He would have no idea what to do.	Yandibadde talina kirowoozo kya kukola.
He can find someone else.	Asobola okufuna omuntu omulala.
He said he was fine.	Yagambye nti ali bulungi.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
He must always be ready to work.	Bulijjo alina okuba nga mwetegefu okukola.
I knew that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi.
I guess you have too.	Ntebereza nti naawe olina.
However, I expect more from this issue.	Kyokka, nsuubira bingi mu nsonga eno.
Night was coming on.	Ekiro kyali kigenda okutuuka.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
To move forward.	Okugenda mu maaso.
He also had trouble arriving on time.	Era yafuna obuzibu okutuuka mu budde.
But he works hard.	Naye akola nnyo.
I need to be alone.	Nze nneetaaga okubeera nzekka.
And that’s dangerous.	Era ekyo kya bulabe.
How would he do .	Yandikoze atya .
This is going to be very complicated.	Kino kigenda kizibu nnyo.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
We are in that situation.	Tuli mu mbeera eyo.
I hope it will happen.	Nsuubira nti kijja kubaawo.
It was really good.	Ddala kyali kirungi.
But you have to go now.	Naye olina okugenda kati.
And we have to win.	Era tulina okuwangula.
The arrangement worked well.	Enteekateeka eyo yakola bulungi.
Tom knew it.	Tom yali akimanyi.
To the guy.	Eri ggaayi.
But that will happen.	Naye ekyo kijja kubaawo.
I will definitely do this again.	Kino nja kuddamu okukola ddala.
But he knew he couldn't.	Naye yali akimanyi nti tasobola.
Not at the moment.	Si mu kiseera kino.
That’s how hungry he was.	Bwatyo bwe yali enjala.
But no one wants that.	Naye ekyo tewali ayagala.
That’s pretty easy to see.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo okulaba.
I think he's really happy.	Ndowooza ddala musanyufu.
He had no such thing.	Yali talina kintu ng’ekyo.
I might have known it.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnali nkimanyi.
I was a human being.	Nze nali muntu.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
I think it’s very important.	Ndowooza nti kikulu nnyo.
Or it could be the same.	Oba kiyinza okuba nga kye kimu.
He was a really nice guy.	Yali ggaayi mulungi ddala.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka, kino si kituufu.
At the same time .	Mu kiseera kye kimu .
It’s not true.	Si mazima.
We need to get stronger.	Tulina okufuna amaanyi.
And now, with this .	Era kati, ne kino .
He works very, very hard.	Akola nnyo nnyo.
I need help with this.	Kino nneetaaga obuyambi.
He didn't quite know how.	Yali tamanyi bulungi ngeri ki.
The guy was really into that.	Ggaayi yali mu ekyo ddala.
Now he spoke.	Kati yayogera.
He hoped he knew better.	Yalina essuubi nti asinga okumanya.
He would love to see this.	Kino yandiyagadde nnyo okulaba.
It was important for me to do.	Kyali kikulu gyendi okukola.
My brother is a musician.	Muganda wange muyimbi.
That’s what he should be.	Ekyo kye yandibadde.
You are like me.	Ggwe oli nga nze.
As soon as we can.	Amangu ddala nga bwe tusobola.
Things like that.	Ebintu nga ebyo.
You were a child.	Ggwe wali mwana muto.
Here lies the whole problem.	Wano waliwo obuzibu bwonna.
You want to be an informed patient.	Oyagala kubeera mulwadde alina okumanya.
Here is the point.	Wano waliwo ensonga.
He certainly didn’t know.	Mazima ddala yali tamanyi.
No, they are not.	Nedda, si bwe bali.
She was so nice and pretty.	Yali mulungi nnyo era nga mulungi nnyo.
He has always been my person.	Bulijjo abadde muntu wange.
For the man she loved.	Ku musajja gwe yali ayagala.
He had to know.	Yalina okumanya.
This was both a good and a bad thing.	Kino kyali kintu kirungi era kibi.
She was his wife.	Yali mukyala we.
But only one thing mattered.	Naye kimu kyokka kye kyali kikulu.
No problems so far.	Tewali buzibu okutuusa kati.
He will always be one of us.	Bulijjo ajja kuba omu ku ffe.
I will never believe it.	Sijja kukkiriza n’akatono.
That may be the case.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
He always works hard.	Bulijjo akola nnyo.
Everything will work.	Buli kimu kijja kukola.
It seems realistic.	Kirabika nga kya ddala.
And to say the least, this is difficult.	Era okugamba nti kino kizibu.
You don’t want it here.	Toyagala wano.
How curious he is.	Nga ayagala nnyo okumanya.
Or thought he needed to.	Oba yalowooza nti yali yeetaaga.
This is not an emergency situation.	Kino si mbeera ya mangu.
He said he was alone.	Yagambye nti yali yekka.
He was a good friend of mine.	Yali mukwano gwange mulungi.
That could be anyone.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba omuntu yenna.
Nothing could have happened.	Tewali kyali kiyinza kubaawo.
You have to do that.	Ekyo olina okukikola.
I really needed this today.	Kino nnali nneetaaga nnyo leero.
Of course, she looks good.	Kya lwatu nti alabika bulungi.
I love it so much.	Nze njagala nnyo.
He had no idea what it was.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki kye kyali.
He hasn't wanted to see.	Abadde tayagala kulaba.
What he was doing there.	Kye yali akola eyo.
If he could get to one, he might be safe.	Singa yali asobola okutuuka ku emu, ayinza okuba nga talina bulabe.
And no one would anyway.	Era nga tewali muntu yenna yandikoze mu ngeri yonna.
In fact, he already has.	Mu butuufu, yalina dda.
If he did, fine.	Singa yakikola, kirungi.
Not even to me.	Si wadde gyendi.
He was very good to me.	Yali mulungi nnyo gyendi.
I think we can move forward.	Ndowooza nti tusobola okugenda mu maaso.
Like maybe there was someone down there.	Nga mpozzi nga waliwo omuntu wansi awo.
But you have to talk to me.	Naye olina okwogera nange.
He was talking too fast.	Yali ayogera mangu nnyo.
I always think it’s him, or about him.	Bulijjo ndowooza nti ye, oba ku ye.
But he was my son.	Naye yali mwana wange.
It’s that time.	Kye kiseera ekyo.
That was not what he expected, not what he expected at all.	Ekyo si kye yali asuubira, si kye yali asuubira n’akatono.
That is definitely not the case.	Ekyo mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
It’s not always true.	Si bulijjo nti kituufu.
He is truly an artist.	Mazima ddala muyimbi.
I love it and .	Njagala nnyo era .
This is a very serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
You don’t like anyone, not really.	Toyagala muntu yenna, si ddala.
I want to do that again soon.	Njagala okuddamu okukola ekyo mu bbanga ttono.
Maybe, maybe not.	Mpozzi, mpozzi nedda.
Not nearly enough to go on.	Si kumpi kumala kugenda mu maaso.
Nothing is more important than that.	Tewali kikulu okusinga ekyo.
But it is not to me, in any way, a picture or a picture.	Naye si gyendi, mu ngeri yonna, ekifaananyi oba ekifaananyi.
I was a little skeptical.	Nali nbuusabuusa katono.
He wanted to make a picture.	Yali ayagala nnyo okukola ekifaananyi.
You know, it’s not my opinion.	Omanyi si ndowooza yange.
I was happy there, very happy.	Nali musanyufu eyo, nga ndi musanyufu nnyo.
However, I loved it.	Kyokka nnali njagala nnyo.
But that’s what you want.	Naye ekyo ky’oyagala.
And every reason to do so.	Era buli nsonga lwaki tulina okukola ekyo.
I know it would be hard for me.	Nkimanyi nti kyandibadde kizibu gyendi.
But it will continue.	Naye kijja kugenda mu maaso.
I am a man who loves to eat.	Ndi musajja ayagala nnyo okulya.
From the bottom.	Okuva wansi.
He wasn’t thinking about himself.	Yali talowooza ku ye kennyini.
I was on him.	Nze nnali ku ye.
But in here .	Naye mu wano .
He knew that now.	Ekyo yali akimanyi kati.
He was almost there.	Yali kumpi awo.
I'm still not sure.	Nze n'okutuusa kati sikakasa.
It is an opinion.	Ye ndowooza.
You know .	Omanyi .
It is very, very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo nnyo.
She looked absolutely beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi ddala.
He doesn’t want his friend.	Tayagala mukwano gwe.
I know now that he doesn’t think at all.	Nkimanyi kati nti talowooza n’akatono.
But we’re all fine now.	Naye ffenna tuli bulungi kati.
And that, obviously, is fine with me.	Era ekyo, kya lwatu, kirungi gyendi.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Naye nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eyo.
It was real, and real.	Kyali kya ddala, era kya ddala.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
He will come alone.	Ajja kujja yekka.
He is a good friend.	Ye mukwano mulungi.
He could not be .	Yali tasobola kuba .
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
In this process .	Mu nkola eno .
No it wasn’t.	Nedda si bwe kyali.
He wanted to see the city.	Yali ayagala kulaba kibuga.
I think that’s the same thing.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kimu.
He's dangerous, you know.	Ali wa bulabe, omanyi.
Nobody does that.	Tewali muntu yenna akola ekyo.
And then he is all over me.	Era awo yenna abeera ku nze.
I certainly deserved it.	Mazima ddala nnali nsaanidde.
No one knew why.	Tewali yali amanyi lwaki.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
No idea police.	Tewali ndowooza poliisi.
His phone started ringing.	Essimu ye yatandika okukuba.
It won’t last long now.	Tekijja kumala bbanga ddene kati.
Very early in the morning.	Nga bukyali nnyo.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
That was what he expected.	Ekyo kye yali asuubira.
We are in existence.	Tuli mu kubeerawo.
It was going to be very close.	Kyali kigenda kuba kya kumpi nnyo.
He is a very sick man.	Musajja mulwadde nnyo.
The dog is not good.	Embwa si kirungi.
And not always with me.	Era si bulijjo nange.
There is his wife	Waliwo mukyala we .
He came, well, as a friend.	Yajja, bulungi, nga mukwano gwe.
And they were in a hurry.	Era baali mu bwangu.
He was very good indeed.	Yali mulungi nnyo ddala.
This is easy to see.	Kino kyangu okulaba.
I have a plan for you.	Nnina enteekateeka gy’oli.
But there was nothing, nothing.	Naye nga tewali kintu kyonna, tewali kintu kyonna.
A little bit lower.	Wansi katono.
We should get to address that.	Ekyo tusaanidde okufuna okukola ku nsonga eyo.
He won’t talk about himself.	Tajja kwogera ku ye.
Apparently nothing too serious.	Kirabika tewali kizibu nnyo.
I'll go home to my room now.	Nja kudda eka mu kisenge kyange kati.
Or whatever it is.	Oba kyonna kye kiri.
Or he can do anything.	Oba asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
You have to eat.	Olina okulya.
But he didn’t have it.	Naye nga talina.
No one spoke much.	Tewali yayogera nnyo.
No, certainly too soon.	Nedda, mazima ddala mangu nnyo.
He started at home.	Yatandika awaka.
Nothing good could ever happen in this city.	Tewali kirungi kyali kiyinza kubaawo mu kibuga kino.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
Now it’s good.	Kati kirungi.
We’re fine right now.	Tuli bulungi mu kiseera kino.
And that’s not easy.	Era ekyo si kyangu.
What he saw in her.	Kye yalaba mu ye.
He himself had no time.	Ye kennyini yali talina budde.
Of course, this can be a problem.	Kya lwatu nti kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
He didn’t want to talk about anything.	Yali tayagala kwogera ku kintu kyonna.
Maybe even a lot.	Mpozzi ne bingi.
I wanted to work with him.	Nnali njagala okukola naye.
He is both and not both at the same time.	Ye bombi era si bombi mu kiseera kye kimu.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
He does everything.	Akola buli kimu.
He thinks a lot about himself.	Alowooza nnyo ku ye.
I wasn’t feeling well.	Nze nali siri bulungi.
You can't do whatever you want here.	Tosobola kukola kyonna kyoyagala wano.
It’s not that complicated as well.	Si kizibu nnyo nga bwe kiri.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
He couldn’t believe that.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukkiriza.
But really who knows.	Naye ddala ani amanyi.
I need someone else.	Nze nneetaaga omuntu omulala.
You can see everything happening.	Osobola okulaba nga buli kimu kigenda mu maaso.
This is actually the case.	Kino mu butuufu bwe kiri.
I want it though.	Njagala wadde.
They were a wonderful group.	Baali kibiina kirungi nnyo.
But someone has to speak up.	Naye omuntu alina okwogera.
That’s definitely not me.	Ekyo mazima ddala si nze.
He was very popular.	Yali muganzi nnyo.
This is his chance.	Guno gwe mukisa gwe.
He obviously had an opinion.	Kya lwatu nti yalina endowooza ye.
He couldn’t see anyone.	Yali tasobola kulaba muntu yenna.
He doesn’t want to eat anything, alone.	Tayagala kulya kintu, yekka.
He was really strong.	Ddala yali wa maanyi.
Not much money.	Ssente si nnyingi.
He knew this.	Kino yali akimanyi.
It probably doesn’t matter.	Oboolyawo si kikulu.
You were just a kid.	Ggwe wali mwana muto yekka.
It was too fast for me.	Kyali kya mangu nnyo gyendi.
He needed this.	Kino yali yeetaaga.
One is in jail.	Omu ali mu kkomera.
I can't see.	Sisobola kulaba.
It doesn’t matter what.	Si kikulu kiki.
That would be better than this.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi okusinga kino.
But he knows one thing.	Naye amanyi ekintu kimu.
However, it is not the same.	Kyokka si kye kimu.
Now it just isn’t.	Kati si bwe kiri kyokka.
That was the problem, he knew.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu, yali akimanyi.
That was me.	Oyo nnali nze.
And, he probably did.	Era, oboolyawo yakikola.
I'm not sure there is, but who knows.	Sikakasa nti waliwo naye ani amanyi.
That’s not me.	Oyo si nze.
For us, that was that.	Ffe, ekyo kye kyali ekyo.
And he still does it.	Era n’okutuusa kati akikola.
We don’t even have to react to each other.	Tetulina kuddamu na kukola ku buli omu.
In my time.	Mu kiseera kyange.
You won’t do it.	Tojja kukikola.
Not even the phone.	Wadde essimu.
It’s good where it is.	Kirungi we kiri.
That’s not a bad thing, obviously.	Ekyo si kintu kibi, kya lwatu.
But now he knew he was more than that.	Naye kati yali akimanyi nti yali asinga ekyo.
Not a good opportunity.	Si mukisa mulungi.
It is a very important place.	Kifo kikulu nnyo.
The same thing goes very well everywhere.	Ekintu kye kimu kigenda bulungi nnyo buli wamu.
Anyone could talk.	Omuntu yenna yali asobola okwogera.
He would be sick.	Yandibadde mulwadde.
He could barely eat alone.	Yali asobola bulungi okulya yekka.
Here this is not the case.	Wano kino si bwe kiri.
And he couldn’t do it.	Era yali tasobola kukikola.
Nothing seemed to really matter.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyali kirabika nga kikulu ddala.
You’re the one who has to step back.	Ggwe alina okudda emabega.
That would be for you.	Ekyo kyandibadde gy’oli.
Not on him.	Si ku ye.
He was always, always busy.	Bulijjo, bulijjo yali bbize.
It was great, it was definitely bad.	Kyali kirungi nnyo, mazima ddala kyali kibi.
He has been very good.	Abadde mulungi nnyo.
But it could be anything.	Naye kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
And that’s what it was.	Era ekyo kye kyali.
But he is fine.	Naye ali bulungi.
I don’t really know.	Simanyi ddala.
It's all me so far.	Byonna nze okutuuka wano.
I can’t quite believe it myself.	Nze kennyini sisobola bulungi kukkiriza.
Not now, anyway.	Si kati, mu ngeri yonna.
And you are, every day.	Era oli, buli lunaku.
It’s really up to you.	Ddala kiri gyoli.
But this isn’t quite as simple as it sounds.	Naye kino si kyangu nnyo nga bwe kirabika.
It is certainly true.	Mazima ddala kituufu.
It’s time to go to the bedroom.	Kye kiseera okugenda mu kisenge.
He couldn't believe she was with him.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza nti yali naye.
He's really good, you know.	Ddala mulungi nnyo, omanyi.
But it won’t work.	Naye tekijja kukola.
I am so alone here.	Nze wano ndi nzekka nnyo.
In a sense, he was.	Mu ngeri emu, yali.
Right now, he had no time.	Mu kiseera kino, yali talina budde.
Or perhaps it is.	Oba oboolyawo bwe kiri.
I am not in any organization.	Siri mu kibiina kyonna.
I am a human being.	Nze omuntu.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
He said you will know.	Yagamba nti ojja kumanya.
Finding a job is actually really the most important thing.	Okufuna omulimu mu butuufu ddala kye kikulu ennyo.
Don’t go to the office.	Togenda mu ofiisi.
Everything was easy.	Buli kimu kyali kyangu.
But he heard someone.	Naye yawulira omuntu.
I’m not doing anything.	Nze sirina kye nkola.
I have to have money.	Nnina okuba ne ssente.
I won’t talk about money.	Sijja kwogera ku ssente.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
The food was good.	Okulya kyali kirungi.
Almost there! 	Kumpi awo!
No one knows the truth now.	Tewali amanyi mazima kati.
He must have known better though, he knew that.	Ateekwa okuba nga ye yali asinga okumanya wadde, ekyo yali akimanyi.
He got something.	Yafuna ekintu.
But other than that, he had absolutely nothing.	Naye okuggyako ekyo, yali talina ky’alina n’akatono.
You know why.	Omanyi ensonga lwaki.
I have to go back to the office now.	Nnina okudda mu ofiisi kati.
In my place! 	Mu kifo kyange!
. . . .	.
Why did he do it.	Lwaki yakikola.
Hitting hard on.	Okukuba ennyo ku.
It was the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu.
Maybe next week.	Mpozzi wiiki ejja.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I forgive everyone.	Nsonyiwa buli omu.
You can do this yourself.	Kino osobola okukikola ggwe kennyini.
I don’t even have time for a casual relationship.	Sirina na budde bwa mukwano gwa bulijjo.
However, that is not a bad thing.	Kyokka ekyo si kibi.
We are together.	Tuli wamu.
He had to live with her.	Yalina okubeera naye.
That’s how he had it.	Bwatyo bwe yalina.
And of course, this is a lucky place for them.	Era ddala, kino kifo kya mukisa gye bali.
And indeed, it is.	Era ddala, bwe kiri.
It doesn’t matter.	Si nsonga.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He was dangerous to you.	Yali wa bulabe gy’oli.
It’s not too hard, but it’s important.	Si kizibu nnyo, naye kikulu.
He knew everything.	Yali amanyi buli kimu.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I am the power.	Nze ndi maanyi.
I don’t have time.	Sirina budde.
At that time there was no time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nga tewali budde.
Wherever we go, there we are.	Buli gye tugenda, awo we tuli.
Everything is absolutely right, here.	Buli kimu kituufu ddala, wano.
A lot like you in so many ways.	Bingi nga ggwe mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo.
But he had to go.	Naye yalina okugenda.
But he was ready.	Naye yali mwetegefu.
He must think so.	Ateekwa okulowooza nti bw’atyo.
In this case .	Mu mbeera eno .
He is not too young.	Si muto nnyo.
He's a good man, you know.	Musajja mulungi, omanyi.
That's just me though.	Oyo nze nzekka wadde.
I couldn’t let it happen again.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza kuddamu kubaawo.
I have to go home, he said.	Nnina okudda eka, bwe yagambye.
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
Then he must be asleep.	Awo ateekwa okuba nga yeebase.
No one does that.	Tewali akola bw’atyo.
Which you knew to be true.	Kye wali omanyi nti kituufu.
But not about this.	Naye si ku kino.
Not how it mattered.	Si ngeri gye kyali kikulu.
The reason is that he lives there.	Ensonga eri nti abeera eyo.
He definitely needed help.	Mazima ddala yali yeetaaga obuyambi.
He could get that.	Ekyo yali asobola okufuna.
He really wanted to go.	Yali ayagala nnyo okugenda.
That’s probably not what you want.	Ekyo osanga si ky’oyagala.
I feel so young.	Nze mpulira nga ndi muto nnyo.
But something in each will be.	Naye ekintu mu buli omu kijja kuba.
There is nothing to do about it.	Tewali kya kukola ku nsonga eyo.
This is a great option.	Eno nkola nnungi nnyo.
That’s not what it is now.	Ekyo si kye kiri kati.
But not all of it.	Naye si byonna.
And he was very good at his job.	Era yali mulungi nnyo mu mulimu gwe.
He was a lucky man, he knew it.	Yali musajja wa mukisa, yali akimanyi.
That’s not really what he said.	Ekyo mu butuufu si kye yayogera.
It’s very difficult now.	Kizibu nnyo kati.
Maybe he should always try.	Mpozzi bulijjo yandibadde agezaako.
He wanted to	Yali ayagala .
No answer at all.	Tewali kuddamu n’akatono.
I feel like I’m happy.	Mpulira nga ndi musanyufu.
It’s not true at all.	Si kituufu n’akatono.
I knew it could happen.	Nnali nkimanyi nti kiyinza okubaawo.
I hope he is okay.	Nsuubira nti ali bulungi.
And maybe a little easier to go.	Era mpozzi nga kyangu katono okugenda.
I didn’t feel anything.	Nnali sirina kye mpulira.
He has you.	Alina ggwe.
That will be enough for each of us.	Ekyo kijja kumala buli omu ku ffe.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
No, that’s not me.	Nedda, oyo si nze.
And very quickly, in fact.	Era mu bwangu ddala, mu butuufu.
I want all of us and all of me.	Njagala ffenna nange yenna.
It’s really easy.	Ddala kyangu.
I’m going to school.	Ngenda ku ssomero.
I have no idea about that.	Ekyo sirina kye mmanyi.
You want to help.	Oyagala kuyamba.
But really, that’s mine.	Naye ddala, ekyo kyange.
What will you be?.	Ggwe ojja kuba ki?.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
We both need to do it.	Ffembi twetaaga okukikola.
Or he would have.	Oba yandibadde.
He has always lived there.	Bulijjo abadde abeera eyo.
They were strong and powerful.	Baali ba maanyi era nga ba maanyi.
Issue.	Ensonga.
He shouldn’t be in jail.	Talina kubeera mu kkomera.
The food is pretty good though.	Emmere nnungi nnyo wadde.
He is a versatile guy.	Ye ggaayi alina ebintu bingi.
But so does every day.	Naye bw’atyo buli lunaku.
Next week, or sooner.	Wiiki ejja, oba amangu ddala.
I am not one myself.	Nze kennyini siri omu.
Now I was safe.	Kati nnali sirina bulabe.
He was friendly.	Yali wa mukwano.
He didn't seem to want to come forward.	Yalabika nga tayagala kujja mu maaso.
Nice, nice guy.	Ggaayi omulungi, omulungi.
I am not alone in this at all.	Kino siri nzekka n’akatono.
This is the reason I think.	Eno y'ensonga ndowooza.
I want to stay alone.	Njagala kusigala nga ndi nzekka.
They were almost home.	Baali kumpi okutuuka awaka.
However, at the same time.	Kyokka, mu kiseera kye kimu.
I'm not so sure about everything.	Sikakasa nnyo ku buli kimu.
He didn’t want to do that.	Ekyo yali tayagala kukikola.
That's what his house was like.	Ennyumba ye bwe yali.
Probably both of them.	Oboolyawo bombi.
Well! 	Bulungi!
He doesn’t need anything.	Teyeetaaga kintu kyonna.
I can’t say when.	Siyinza kwogera ddi.
Police all over the place.	Poliisi mu kifo kyonna.
He goes downstairs.	Agenda wansi.
I needed someone like him.	Nnali nneetaaga omuntu nga ye.
Everyone has one.	Buli muntu alina emu.
He is very	Ye nnyo .
It’s a very good point.	Ensonga nnungi nnyo.
Both were in excellent condition.	Bombi baali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
And someone else .	Era omuntu omulala .
And yet .	Era naye .
He didn’t know how to drive.	Yali tamanyi kuvuga mmotoka.
I know where I’m going.	Nze mmanyi gye ngenda.
But you mostly.	Naye ggwe okusinga.
And you have it in your house.	Era olina mu nnyumba yo.
To me, it is.	Eri nze, bwe kiri.
But here he actually wanted one.	Naye wano mu butuufu yali ayagala emu.
Nothing lower than that.	Tewali kintu kyonna wansi okusinga ekyo.
It was awful for me.	Kyali kibi nnyo gyendi.
It’s not a systematic approach.	Si nkola ya nkola.
And it’s very quick.	Era bwangu nnyo.
Everyone there is vulnerable.	Buli muntu ali eyo ali mu bulabe.
Where, or for how long, he had no idea.	Wa, oba okumala bbanga ki, yali talina kirowoozo kyonna.
It’s not hard to find one.	Si kizibu kufuna emu.
He tried to think of what to say.	Yagezaako okulowooza ku ky’alina okwogera.
Everyone knew it well.	Buli omu yali akimanyi bulungi.
I wasn’t sure that.	Nali sikakasa nti.
He did work.	Yakola okukola.
I wanted so much more of him.	Nnali njagala bingi nnyo ku ye.
But it was very simple.	Naye kyali kyangu nnyo.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
They were busy.	Baali bbize.
Maybe he had somewhere.	Mpozzi nga waliwo we yalina.
I'm in a good class.	Ndi mu kibiina kirungi.
He'll go soon, he'll go, she thought.	Ajja kugenda mangu, ajja kugenda, bwe yalowooza.
That was all he needed to know.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali yeetaaga okumanya.
And now it seems this is true.	Era kati kirabika kino kituufu.
He would have .	Yandibadde .
None of this is mine, he said.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kyange, bwe yagambye.
That's his thing.	Ekyo kye kintu kye.
He had something to say.	Yalina kye yayogera.
I couldn’t go.	Nnali sisobola kugenda.
And he is with me here.	Era ali nange wano.
I’m completely normal.	Nze ndi wa bulijjo ddala.
He is very curious.	Ayagala nnyo okumanya.
I really hope you will make it as well.	Nsuubira ddala nti ojja kukikola nga bwe kiri.
But he was too close.	Naye yali kumpi nnyo.
Everyone knows that.	Ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
I know it’s hard.	Nkimanyi nti kizibu.
This is really, really bad.	Kino ddala, ddala kibi.
It is very important to us.	Kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
That’s pretty much everything it seems to them.	Ekyo kumpi buli kimu kye kirabika gye bali.
Everyone in front.	Buli muntu mu maaso.
I wanted my book.	Nnali njagala ekitabo kyange.
Whatever, they were here, and it was close.	Kyonna, baali wano, era kyali kumpi.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
The age is yes.	Si ye ye.
You’ve been here.	Obadde wano.
I feel scared.	Mpulira nga ntya.
But being like him, well, no.	Naye okubeera nga ye, bulungi, nedda.
That may be the case.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
You are in	Oli mu .
But none of that was going to happen.	Naye ebyo tewali kyali kigenda kubaawo.
The problem is not money.	Obuzibu si ssente.
Now he is asleep.	Kati yeebase.
I think he is good.	Ndowooza ye nnungi.
It’s not an emergency situation.	Si mbeera ya mangu.
He had to leave this room.	Yalina okuva mu kisenge kino.
I am a father myself.	Nze kennyini ndi taata.
I won't.	Sijja.
I really don’t want to get in trouble.	Mazima ddala saagala kufuna buzibu.
I could go, he thought.	Nnali nsobola okugenda, bwe yalowooza.
That’s not me.	Oyo si nze.
I want to see.	Njagala kulaba.
Much for all of us.	Bingi eri ffenna.
He had to get help immediately.	Yalina okufuna obuyambi mu bwangu.
I am not my father.	Siri taata wange.
I don’t have a job.	Nze sirina mulimu.
And he knew it.	Era yali amanyi.
It was powerful.	Yali ya maanyi.
And he doesn’t want to.	Era tayagala.
I was almost everywhere.	Kumpi nnali mu buli kifo.
They are one in the same.	Bali kimu mu kimu.
He couldn’t tell.	Yali tasobola kumanya.
But they are not.	Naye si bwe bali.
And he could live with me.	Era yali asobola okubeera nange.
But that’s all for now.	Naye ebyo byonna kati.
And he can hit too.	Era naye asobola okukuba.
And of course .	Era ddala .
But he says you’re not.	Naye agamba nti ggwe toli.
And that’s what it is now.	Era ekyo kye kiri kati.
Now he has me.	Kati alina nze.
I want anything, you know? 	Njagala ekintu kyonna, omanyi?
It’s us.	Ye ffe.
That goes a long way.	Ekyo kigenda mu maaso nnyo.
It was a very important one.	Kyali kikulu nnyo.
They were very much together.	Baali wamu nnyo.
He was definitely a friend.	Mazima ddala yali mukwano gwe.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
That’s not a thing.	Ekyo si kintu.
I can’t stay here.	Sisobola kusigala wano.
A moment,' he said suddenly.	Akaseera katono,’ bwe yagamba mu bwangu.
My luck always.	Omukisa gwange bulijjo.
That’s bad for the job.	Ekyo kibi ku mulimu.
I don’t always know why.	Simanyi bulijjo lwaki.
He was unemployed.	Yali talina mulimu.
He is truly an artist.	Mazima ddala muyimbi.
And it was like every.	Era kyali nga buli.
No one can know about this.	Tewali ayinza kumanya ku nsonga eno.
I hope it goes well.	Nsuubira nti kigenda bulungi.
I feel so alone now.	Mpulira nga ndi nzekka nnyo kati.
But it is very important in practice.	Naye kikulu nnyo mu nkola.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
There is no place for that in this industry.	Ekyo tewali kifo kyonna mu mulimu guno.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
I think you know that.	Ndowooza ekyo okimanyi.
I have one issue though.	Nnina ensonga emu wadde.
He needed to see someone.	Waliwo omuntu gwe yali yeetaaga okulaba.
Anything can happen.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo.
You’re going to have to do it yourself.	Ogenda kuba olina okukikola ggwe kennyini.
He had been in a hurry.	Yali abadde mu bwangu.
It’s not really serious.	Si kya maanyi ddala.
He won't.	Tajja.
I could do that.	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola.
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
I just want to know .	Njagala kumanya kyokka .
Not a very good situation.	Si mbeera nnungi nnyo.
Just a little bit, anyway.	Katono ddala, mu ngeri yonna.
Not for long.	Si lwa bbanga ddene.
I don’t want to try again.	Saagala kuddamu kugezaako.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
Anytime, he said.	Buli ssaawa yonna, bwe yagambye.
That was really my point.	Ekyo ddala kye kyali ensonga yange.
Anything he would have .	Ekintu kyonna kye yandibadde alina .
This issue is very urgent though.	Ensonga eno ya mangu nnyo wadde.
It was a very difficult place.	Kyali kifo kizibu nnyo.
Not even to himself.	Si wadde eri ye kennyini.
And yet, he was here.	Era naye, yali wano.
He could see everything.	Yali asobola okulaba buli kimu.
This was a real problem.	Kino kyali kizibu ddala.
It will be much easier.	Kijja kuba kyangu nnyo.
Give the house.	Wa ennyumba.
I was here alone.	Nali wano nzekka.
I feel like I have nothing to do.	Mpulira nga sirina kye nkola.
He was here, that was all.	Yali wano, ekyo kyokka kye kyali.
We need everyone to do this.	Kino okukikola twetaaga buli muntu.
Not with me, anyway.	Si nange, mu ngeri yonna.
And he can’t.	Era tasobola.
You have to do it yourself.	Ggwe kennyini olina okukikola.
He knew it would come for a very long time.	Yali akimanyi nti kijja kujja okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
I am beautiful actually.	Ndi mulungi mu butuufu.
I’m not going to do that.	Ekyo sigenda kukikola.
Until his day .	Okutuusa ku lunaku lwe .
What we have to do.	Kye tulina okukola.
He could have been .	Yali asobola okuba nga .
That doesn’t seem to be the case for me.	Ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri gyendi.
Apparently this was not the case.	Kirabika kino si bwe kyali.
However, he couldn’t quite do it.	Kyokka yali tasobola bulungi kukikola.
But he fell asleep.	Naye yeebase.
And it’s going on.	Era kigenda mu maaso.
Everyone loves this product.	Buli muntu ayagala nnyo ekintu kino.
I thought about everything.	Nalowooza ku buli kimu.
However, it is also true that .	Kyokka era kituufu nti .
No one felt really comfortable in the police force.	Tewali yawulira bulungi ddala mu poliisi.
That's me.	Oyo nze.
That you are moving forward.	Nti ogenda mu maaso.
But not everyone thinks the same.	Naye si buli muntu nti alowooza kye kimu.
But no one expects that to happen.	Naye ekyo tewali asuubira kubaawo.
It will be very helpful.	Kijja kuyamba nnyo.
This is a very common thing.	Kino kintu kya bulijjo nnyo.
He couldn’t let this go on.	Kino yali tasobola kukkiriza kugenda mu maaso.
It’s not for everyone.	Si kya buli muntu.
Right on the horizon, very low.	Ku bbanga ddala, wansi nnyo.
I will be good to you.	Nja kuba mulungi gyoli.
I suppose he had no choice.	Nsuubira nti yali talina kya kukola.
That’s neither here nor there right now.	Ekyo si wano wadde awo mu kiseera kino.
You know, we’re all about eating.	Omanyi ffenna tuli ku kulya.
And maybe he knew this.	Era mpozzi kino yali akimanyi.
We have a lot here, actually.	Tulina bingi wano, mu butuufu.
Pretty good, actually.	Kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
And everything .	Era buli kimu .
And he was alone.	Era yali yekka.
. . . .	.
I hope that’s not the case for anyone.	Nsuubira nti ekyo si bwe kiri eri omuntu yenna.
He didn’t want to wait.	Yali tayagala kulinda.
However, there is a problem.	Kyokka waliwo ekizibu.
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
But this was for good reason.	Naye kino kyali kya nsonga nnungi.
I wanted out of the movie.	Nnali njagala okuva mu firimu eyo.
This will be good for us.	Kino kijja kuba kirungi gye tuli.
But he was beautiful.	Naye yali mulungi.
You will always be strong.	Ojja kuba wa maanyi bulijjo.
I hope you will be there.	Nsuubira nti ojja kubeerawo.
This is definitely a movie to watch.	Eno mazima ddala firimu ya kulaba.
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
Really me.	Ddala nze.
Of course, that’s why you’re here.	Kya lwatu, y’ensonga lwaki oli wano.
I can get one, though.	Kyokka nsobola okufuna emu.
And apparently he did.	Era kirabika yakikola.
But he was the one.	Naye ye yali.
He was a good man.	Yali musajja mulungi.
But we are .	Naye ffe tuli .
You seem to be perfectly fine.	Olabika oli bulungi ddala.
But that was what he was thinking at the time.	Naye ekyo kye yali alowooza mu kiseera ekyo.
She wanted a child.	Yali ayagala mwana.
But how do you do it every day .	Naye okola otya buli lunaku .
You are so lucky.	Oli wa mukisa nnyo.
But of course, you never can.	Naye kya lwatu, tosobola n’akatono.
It was his time.	Yali kiseera kye.
I think he can do it.	Ndowooza asobola okukikola.
Not so much with me.	Nedda nnyo nange.
This is mostly going to be about me.	Kino okusinga kigenda kuba ku nze.
Perhaps he was afraid to find out.	Oboolyawo yali atya okumanya.
I always knew it.	Bulijjo nnali nkimanyi.
Probably not a bad thing.	Oboolyawo si kibi.
No man is working.	Tewali musajja akola.
Everything goes downhill.	Buli kimu kigenda wansi.
I can’t wait for that to happen.	Siyinza kulinda ekyo kubaawo.
All he had to do .	Byonna bye yalina okukola .
I don’t know the answer.	Simanyi kya kuddamu.
I’m going to be a father.	Ngenda kubeera taata.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka kino si kituufu.
I’m with the police.	Nze ndi ne poliisi.
It might be though.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri wadde.
I had also met a friend, a very good friend.	Nnali nfunye ne mukwano gwange, mukwano gwange omulungi ennyo.
I needed to get out of there fast.	Nali nneetaaga okuva awo mangu.
He told me that he was.	Yang’amba nti yali.
I still can’t do it right.	Nze n’okutuusa kati sisobola kukikola bulungi.
I'm thinking about it.	Nze ndowooza ku nsonga eyo.
I am so sorry for this.	Nsonyiwa nnyo kino.
Very good indeed.	Kirungi nnyo ddala.
Even as a child.	Ne nga mwana muto.
But you won’t always have me here with you.	Naye tojja kuba nange wano naawe bulijjo.
I was happy to see that.	Ekyo nnali musanyufu okulaba.
He is actually a teacher.	Mu butuufu ye musomesa.
I am so glad you are here!.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti oli wano!.
At the time they were .	Mu kiseera ekyo baali .
He was as good as you.	Yali mulungi nga ggwe.
Currently,.	Mu kiseera kino,...
No time to go back to school.	Tewali budde bwa kudda ku ssomero.
He has been sleeping soundly.	Abadde yeebase bulungi.
Exactly, this weekend.	Ddala, wiikendi eno.
He needs to talk to me.	Yeetaaga okwogera nange.
It can be hard to do .	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu okukola .
This will do it.	Kino kijja kukikola.
He said I could do better than you.	Yagamba nti nsobola okukola okusinga ggwe.
I could do that.	Ekyo nnali nsobola okukikola.
Right now she doesn’t want him.	Mu kiseera kino tayagala ye.
It is much more important than that.	Kikulu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He probably already did.	Oboolyawo yakola dda.
One could stay for a while.	Omuntu yali asobola okumala akaseera.
I wonder where it is now.	Nze nneebuuza kati gye kiri.
Obviously, this is going to be bad.	Kya lwatu nti kino kigenda kuba kibi.
Only one person.	Omuntu omu yekka.
I just had no choice.	Nnali sirina kya kukola kyokka.
It is the truth.	Ye mazima.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
No, it’s the same.	Nedda, kye kimu.
We’ll just have to do it.	Tujja kumala kukikola.
But in my opinion, it was.	Naye mu ndowooza yange, bwe kyali.
You already know this.	Kino okimanyi dda.
However, he does most of the talking.	Kyokka, okwogera okusinga y’akola.
Not immediately.	Si mangu ddala.
However, it wasn’t.	Kyokka, si bwe kyali.
I have to go immediately.	Nnina okugenda amangu ddala.
But everything was right.	Naye buli kimu kyali kituufu.
And it was difficult.	Era kyali kizibu.
You don’t have to believe everything.	Tolina kukkiriza byonna.
And it was an idea.	Era kyali kirowoozo.
Whatever is going to happen is going to happen soon.	Kyonna ekigenda okubaawo kigenda kubaawo mu bbanga ttono.
It was dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe.
What we are to them.	Kye tuli gye bali.
It may be true.	Kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
In fact, everything is quite accurate.	Mu butuufu, buli kimu kituufu nnyo.
I’m sorry, of course.	Nsonyiwa, ddala.
He must think about this.	Ateekwa okulowooza ku nsonga eno.
This was common at the time.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo mu kiseera ekyo.
You know we can.	Omanyi nti tusobola.
Not bad, really.	Si kibi, ddala.
It’s not a problem at all.	Si kizibu kyonna.
I don’t care, he thought.	Sifaayo, bwe yalowooza.
Now as to the process.	Kati nga ku nkola.
It’s really awful.	Kibi nnyo ddala.
I have a person.	Nnina omuntu.
I knew this would happen, he thought.	Nali mmanyi nti kino kijja kubaawo, bwe yalowooza.
He tried very, very hard.	Yagezaako nnyo nnyo.
In fact, neither could he.	Mu butuufu, era naye yali tasobola.
But now is not the only time.	Naye kati si kye kiseera kyokka.
There is no routine.	Tewali nkola ya bulijjo.
We can go in my car.	Tusobola okugenda mu mmotoka yange.
That’s what’s going to happen.	Ekyo kye kigenda okubaawo.
I don’t even know who’s who.	Nze simanyi na ani ani ani.
That was a wonderful time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo.
This was always going to happen.	Kino kyali kigenda kubaawo bulijjo.
There is nothing here in town.	Tewali kintu kyonna wano mu kibuga.
He knew he would.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
He was an only child.	Yali mwana yekka.
We will definitely be back again.	Mazima ddala tujja kuddamu kuddamu.
You know what, we’ll do it.	Omanyi kiki, tujja kukikola.
Who knew he had one.	Ani yali amanyi nti alina emu.
We can’t do it.	Tetusobola kukikola.
who knows.	ani amanyi.
He wanted himself.	Yali ayagala ye kennyini.
And he has been wanting.	Era abadde ayagala.
It's good when it's good.	Kirungi nga kirungi.
It’s very, very important.	Kikulu nnyo, era kikulu nnyo.
But that won’t help now.	Naye ekyo tekijja kuyamba kati.
I wanted to be a teacher.	Nnali njagala kubeera musomesa.
Now, he would work.	Kati, yandikoze.
He is always moving forward.	Bulijjo agenda mu maaso.
Of course, I had no money.	Kya lwatu nti nnali sirina ssente.
The issue is money.	Ensonga eri ku ssente.
Clearly, that is not the case.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
And then, yes.	Era awo, ye.
We just need to know.	Twetaaga kumanya kyokka.
Which no one has.	Nga tewali muntu yenna alina.
We need to get out of here immediately.	Tulina okuva wano mu bwangu.
I hope to move on from here.	Nsuubira okugenda mu maaso okuva wano.
However, I knew better.	Kyokka nnali mmanyi bulungi.
I want this watch.	Njagala ssaawa eno.
We go down together.	Tugenda wansi wamu.
Certainly not money.	Mazima ddala si ssente.
There is not much we need.	Tewali bingi bye twetaaga.
We were coming anyway.	Twali tujja mu ngeri yonna.
I can do this too.	Kino nange nsobola okukikola.
No one came to help.	Tewali yajja kuyamba.
This was normal.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo.
I love both of them.	Njagala nnyo bombi.
And no, it’s not.	Era nedda, si bwe kiri.
He is a good, good man.	Musajja mulungi, mulungi.
But he was good to me.	Naye yali mulungi gyendi.
And everyone will be fine.	Era buli muntu ajja kuba bulungi.
For the man she loved.	Ku musajja gwe yali ayagala ennyo.
Maybe one night.	Mpozzi ekiro kimu.
He doesn’t have time for that.	Ekyo talina budde.
I needed to be alone.	Nnali nneetaaga okubeera nzekka.
This attitude was a good one.	Endowooza eno yali nnungi.
And it was for good reason.	Era kyali lwa nsonga nnungi.
I live for being alone.	Nze mbeera lwa kubeera nzekka.
Everyone is fine with me.	Buli omu ali bulungi gyendi.
He seems like a very nice person.	Alabika muntu mulungi nnyo.
And it was really great, and maybe really easy.	Era ddala kyali kirungi nnyo, era mpozzi ddala kyangu.
That seems to be a good thing.	Ekyo kirabika nga kirungi.
It was a matter of when .	Yali nsonga ya ddi .
I will definitely come.	Mazima ddala nja kujja.
And you should come too.	Era naawe wandibadde ojja.
You should be fine.	Olina okuba nga oli bulungi.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
He agreed so, anyway.	Yakkiriza bw’atyo, mu ngeri yonna.
I have been alone for a long time.	Mbadde nzekka okumala ebbanga ddene.
His personality is like that.	Omuntu we bw’atyo.
This is so easy.	Kino nga kyangu nnyo.
We just have something.	Tulina ekintu kyokka.
And he thinks quickly.	Era alowooza mangu.
And you need to do it quickly.	Era olina okukikola amangu.
Everyone is doing the work.	Buli omu akola omulimu.
That was good for me.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
He couldn't go anyway.	Mu ngeri yonna yali tasobola kugenda.
There is nothing wrong with being happy.	Tewali kibi kyonna mu kubeera musanyufu.
And it’s three.	Era ye ssatu.
But no one went.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna yagenda.
That is not the case now.	Ekyo si bwe kiri kati.
And quickly.	Era mu bwangu.
This is not a good thing.	Kino si kirungi.
No one knew who he was.	Tewali yali amanyi ani.
That is not the case everywhere.	Ekyo si bwe kiri buli wamu.
And we were friends.	Era twali ba mukwano.
He could do that.	Ekyo yali asobola okukola.
Everyone is still in this place.	Buli omu akyali mu kifo kino.
To me, that’s very powerful.	Eri nze, ekyo kya maanyi nnyo.
He said it wasn’t bad.	Yagambye nti si kibi.
Probably both are.	Oboolyawo bombi bwe bali.
He did so much of it.	Yakikola bingi nnyo.
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
We can’t let that happen again.	Tetusobola kukkiriza ekyo kuddamu kubaawo.
But there is no luck.	Naye tewali mukisa.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
But there was absolutely no one.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna n’akatono.
He is my son.	Ye mwana wange.
He calls and says we need to talk.	Akuba essimu n’agamba nti twetaaga okwogera.
Maybe both together.	Mpozzi bombi nga bali wamu.
You may get out of this.	Oyinza okuva mu kino.
This is simply not true.	Kino si kituufu kyokka.
I’m still not sure.	Nze n’okutuusa kati sikakasa.
He couldn’t get a purchase.	Yali tasobola kufuna kugula.
My picture was in the background.	Ekifaananyi kyange kyali emabega.
But that would now have to wait.	Naye ekyo kati kyandibadde kigenda kulinda.
You can’t do that.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola.
Perhaps it always was.	Oboolyawo bulijjo bwe kyali.
Much the same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu nnyo.
He loved the book.	Yali ayagala nnyo ekitabo ekyo.
He is always busy in himself.	Bulijjo abeera bbize mu ye.
I know it, too.	Nze nange nkimanyi.
You don’t want to.	Ggwe toyagala.
But now you know that you know.	Naye kati omanyi nti omanyi.
This is not always easy to do.	Kino si kyangu kukikola bulijjo.
I will do what we can.	Nja kukola kye tusobola.
You know he’s nervous.	Omanyi nti alina obuzibu.
I’m sure there’s something.	Nkakasa nti waliwo ekintu.
I want the same from you.	Nze njagala kye kimu okuva gy’oli.
It is exactly what it is.	Ddala kye kiri.
That is my situation.	Ekyo kye mbeera yange.
I don’t care about anything.	Sifaayo ku kintu kyonna.
I think he lives in his car.	Ndowooza abeera mu mmotoka ye.
Perhaps you like that too.	Oboolyawo naawe ekyo ggwe oyagala nnyo.
You are powerless.	Ggwe tolina maanyi.
My wife .	Mukyala wange .
I don’t care at all.	Nze sifaayo n’akatono.
Not so much tonight.	Si nnyo ekiro kino.
He was a young child.	Yali mwana muto.
I want to talk to him.	Njagala kwogera naye.
He is not like you.	Tali nga ggwe.
I couldn’t do that.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola.
He certainly would be.	Mazima ddala yandibadde bw’atyo.
And he knows it.	Era akimanyi.
But this is not a problem.	Naye kino si kizibu.
And we are friends and all.	Era tuli ba mukwano era ffenna.
Not from me, anyway.	Si okuva gyendi, mu ngeri yonna.
Not really him, obviously.	Mu butuufu si ye, kya lwatu.
And things like that.	Era ebintu nga ebyo.
And yet, and yet .	Era naye, era naye .
Like he didn’t want to talk.	Nga bwe yali tayagala kwogera.
It will be hard work.	Kijja kuba kya kukola nnyo.
When someone has .	Nga omuntu alina .
He is a man.	Ye musajja.
Will definitely not buy again.	Mazima ddala tajja kuddamu kugula.
Not in this city.	Si mu kibuga kino.
I’ve been thinking about him.	Mbadde ndowooza ku ye.
It’s not like it’s a problem.	Si nga bwe kiri nti kizibu.
This isn’t the same thing though.	Kino si kye kimu wadde.
That’s no problem at all.	Ekyo tewali buzibu bwonna.
In truth, there is nothing there.	Mu mazima, tewali kintu kyonna awo.
He is really very good.	Ddala mulungi nnyo.
Maybe he’ll get lucky.	Mpozzi ajja kufuna omukisa.
Maybe it was true.	Mpozzi nga kyali kituufu.
He didn’t need anything.	Yali teyeetaaga kintu kyonna.
I am happy with everything.	Ndi musanyufu ne buli kimu.
It’s important to me.	Kikulu gyendi.
I hope he has.	Nsuubira nti alina.
You can talk to him.	Oyinza okwogera naye.
And that’s the only time when .	Era ekyo kye kiseera kyokka nga .
To access this system.	Okutuuka ku nkola eno.
Even today.	N’okutuusa leero.
You’re going to be with me on this job.	Ogenda kubeera nange ku mulimu guno.
And it’s a thing.	Era kintu.
Very well, he would have to go.	Kirungi nnyo, yandibadde alina okugenda.
But it is not true that.	Naye si kituufu nti.
I want to try this.	Njagala kugezaako kino.
And we’ll probably agree anyway.	Era osanga tujja kukkiriza mu ngeri yonna.
It should be easy to see which.	Alina okuba nga kyangu okulaba ki.
I wondered that all the time.	Ekyo nnali nneebuuza buli kiseera.
Like, that thing.	Nga, ekintu ekyo.
Here we are.	Wano we tuli.
No, he couldn’t do that.	Nedda, ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
He can’t work with her, either.	Tasobola kukola naye, era.
He is still in the same place.	Akyali mu kifo kye kimu.
We can do all of this.	Bino byonna tusobola okukola.
I have preferences, of course.	Nnina bye njagala, ddala.
Everyone except me.	Buli muntu okuggyako nze.
You already know it.	Okimanyi dda.
Not a terrible problem, no.	Si kizibu kya maanyi nnyo, nedda.
None of that stuff.	Tewali kintu kyonna ekyo.
I think he might be too.	Ndowooza ayinza okuba nga naye.
I doubt you’ll get one.	Nbuusabuusa nti ojja kufuna emu.
This is not the movie.	Eno si ye firimu.
Very good for something like this.	Mulungi nnyo ku kintu nga kino.
It will be coming soon.	Kijja kujja mu bbanga ttono.
It’s almost evening.	Buli kumpi akawungeezi.
It is a dangerous place.	Kifo kya bulabe.
This is really .	Kino ddala .
He said it would be very dangerous.	Yagambye nti kijja kuba kya bulabe nnyo.
And that’s not a bad thing.	Era ekyo si kibi.
But now you are in prison.	Naye kati oli mu kkomera.
That’s certainly the case here.	Ekyo mazima ddala bwe kiri wano.
We needed to talk about what we needed to do.	Twali twetaaga okwogera ku kye tulina okukola.
I can’t quite believe it.	Siyinza bulungi kukkiriza.
It was coming .	Kyali kijja .
And that’s what we need to do.	Era ekyo kye twetaaga okukola.
My office will be home.	Ofiisi yange ejja kuba waka.
I was to help.	Nnali wa kuyamba.
Like my boyfriend.	Nga muganzi wange.
I always knew you would.	Bulijjo nnali mmanyi nti ojja kukikola.
No one is going here.	Wano tewali agenda.
I was working hard.	Nnali nkola nnyo.
For us it’s very important.	Ffe kikulu nnyo.
It won’t be the same without you.	Tekijja kuba kye kimu nga tolina ggwe.
This is obviously not entirely true.	Kino kya lwatu si kituufu ddala.
It was coming too fast for me, of course.	Kyali kijja mangu nnyo gyendi, ddala.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
He is now	Kati ali .
But he knows it.	Naye akimanyi.
You have to see someone.	Olina okulaba omuntu.
And so far, so good.	Era okutuuka wano, kirungi nnyo.
He is in excellent condition.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
Will definitely buy from you again.	Mazima ddala ajja kuddamu okugula okuva gyoli.
All alone.	Byonna yekka.
Everything is fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi.
. . . .	.
But you’re lucky, not like me.	Naye oli wa mukisa, si nga nze.
It’s really really hard.	Ddala ddala kizibu nnyo.
I am ready to go.	Ndi mwetegefu okugenda.
The opinion is not mine.	Endowooza si yange.
We go to the room.	Tugenda mu kisenge.
And he has no friends.	Era talina mikwano.
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
Actually, that’s a lot.	Mu butuufu, ebyo bingi nnyo.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
I really want to go now.	Njagala nnyo okugenda kati nnyo.
This is not quite true.	Kino si kituufu nnyo.
It was a sin.	Kyali kibi.
He speaks the truth.	Ayogera mazima ddala.
He always looks like that.	Bulijjo alabika bw’atyo.
But really everything.	Naye ddala buli kimu.
Now, that would be romantic.	Kati, ekyo kyandibadde kya mukwano.
Not really in person.	Si ddala mu muntu.
And there was money.	Era nga waliwo ssente.
I’m not ready.	Nze siri mwetegefu.
He is a good child.	Ye mwana mulungi.
It’s actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
You can talk better than us but it won’t help.	Oyinza okwogera obulungi okusinga ffe naye tekijja kuyamba.
You of course, won’t.	Ggwe ddala, tojja kukikola.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
I'm not sure how long.	Sikakasa bbanga ki.
This is not exactly the case.	Kino si bwe kiri ddala.
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
It was him, just him.	Yali ye, ye yekka.
But it’s also difficult.	Naye era kizibu.
More alone than ever.	Okusinga bwe yali yekka okusinga bwe yali abadde.
You have any girlfriend.	Olina muganzi yenna.
This is what really matters.	Kino kye kikulu ennyo.
Tomorrow, of course.	Enkya, ddala.
There and there.	Eyo ne eyo.
I am ready.	Ndi mwetegefu.
Maybe that’s where he is.	Mpozzi awo w’ali.
But you’re fine.	Naye ggwe oli bulungi.
I can just do things very, very quickly.	Nsobola okumala okukola ebintu mu bwangu nnyo nnyo.
I was feeling good.	Nali mpulira bulungi.
He could do it now, do it here.	Yali asobola okukikola kati, okukikola wano.
This is an important aspect of the industry.	Kino kintu kikulu nnyo mu mulimu guno.
That he was in the car.	Nti yali mu mmotoka.
There is one.	Waliwo omu.
He was an ordinary guy.	Yali ggaayi wa bulijjo.
And there’s me.	Era waliwo nze.
It was my idea, but his money.	Kyali kirowoozo kyange, naye ssente ze.
Even on the weekends.	Ne ku wiikendi.
In fact, he is anything but.	Mu butuufu, ye kintu kyonna naye.
It’s time to speak up.	Kye kiseera okwogera.
That person is talking.	Oyo omuntu ayogera.
No cars, of course.	Tewali mmotoka, ddala.
Maybe it won’t be too bad.	Mpozzi tekijja kuba kibi nnyo.
He was thinking ahead.	Yali alowooza mu maaso.
He knew that .	Yali akimanyi nti .
In that case you probably should.	Mu mbeera eyo osanga wandibadde okola.
From room to room.	Okuva mu kisenge okudda mu kisenge.
He is very happy indeed.	Musanyufu nnyo ddala.
He will be here right now.	Ajja kuba wano mu kiseera kino.
He does that, though.	Ekyo akikola, wadde.
There is no reason not to.	Tewali nsonga lwaki tetulina.
You are so beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo.
It just goes away.	Kigenda kyokka.
Excellent food, very quick delivery.	Emmere nnungi nnyo, okutuusa ku bwangu nnyo.
But it’s not him.	Naye si ye.
Everyone is down.	Buli omu ali wansi.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
He is the best.	Asinga.
We’re going to go soon.	Tugenda kugenda mangu.
And this is the room.	Era kino kye kisenge.
I knew it would happen.	Namanya nti kijja kubaawo.
But you can.	Naye osobola.
I plan to do it.	Nteekateeka okukikola.
It’s simple, plain and fast.	Kyangu, kya lwatu era kya bwangu.
We could work on the money together.	Twali tusobola okukola ku ssente nga tuli wamu.
I think that’s probably a problem.	Ndowooza nti osanga ekyo kizibu.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
He's coming now.	Ajja kati.
It’s difficult though.	Kizibu wadde.
Nothing good comes easy.	Tewali kirungi kijja kyangu.
Back to the same thing.	Okudda ku kimu.
To me he was very good.	Eri nze yali mulungi nnyo.
This is a very serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
Only one made a speech.	Omu yekka ye yakola okwogera.
Now we need to think about when.	Kati twetaaga okulowooza ku ddi.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
I just want my own.	Njagala kyange kyokka.
Of course, you can do that.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo osobola okukikola.
He should have known.	Yandibadde amanyi.
Either me or you.	Oba nze oba ggwe.
You know how it is.	Omanyi bwe kiri.
This will never happen.	Kino tekijja kubaawo.
But this is not true everywhere.	Naye kino si kituufu buli wamu.
Not bad at all, just fine.	Si kibi n'akatono, kirungi ddala.
That’s not quite the same.	Ekyo si kye kimu nnyo.
Not like he did.	Si nga bwe yakola.
I’m sure it will be fine.	Nkakasa nti kijja kuba bulungi.
His father's house.	Ennyumba ya taata we.
We’ll stay.	Tujja kusigala.
He is very	Ye nnyo .
He doesn’t know we’re in town.	Tamanyi nti tuli mu kibuga.
But you know, of course you have.	Naye omanyi, ddala olina.
It’s a simple thing.	Kintu kyangu.
Not just me, me, me.	Si nze nzekka, nze, nze.
Neither place would work.	Tewali kifo kyonna kyali kigenda kukola.
I want to go to the hospital.	Njagala kugenda mu ddwaaliro.
It’s not a job.	Si mulimu.
But now he knew why.	Naye kati yali amanyi lwaki.
He doesn’t want to be friends with everyone.	Tayagala kubeera mukwano gwa buli muntu.
And that’s a problem.	Era ekyo kizibu.
But not his movies.	Naye si firimu ze.
I work hard.	Nkola nnyo.
That’s not why he’s here.	Si y’ensonga lwaki ali wano.
You wish it wasn’t.	Oyagala nga si bwe kiri.
But he was very thoughtful.	Naye yali alowooza nnyo.
You look so much better now.	Olabika bulungi nnyo kati.
Surely, that’s what his wife wants.	Mazima ddala, ekyo mukyala we ky’ayagala.
When did he .	Ddi lwe yakola .
It's actually really bad.	Mu butuufu ddala kibi.
It could very well be.	Kiyinza bulungi nnyo okuba.
I was young.	Nnali muto.
I was the only one.	Nze nnali nzekka.
Mostly, for myself.	Okusinga, ku nze kennyini.
We have a dog.	Tulina embwa.
It won’t quite suffice now.	Tekijja kumala nnyo kati.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
He won’t talk about himself.	Tajja kwogera ku ye.
As it is .	Nga bwe kiri .
Or the same thing.	Oba kye kimu.
But also .	Naye era ne .
Please do it.	Nsaba akole.
He has it.	Alina ye.
You are so powerful.	Oli wa maanyi nnyo.
He thought maybe he could do it.	Yalowooza nti osanga yali asobola okukikola.
He went way beyond his expectations.	Yagenda nnyo okusinga ku bye yali asuubira.
She was so happy to go to school with him.	Yali musanyufu nnyo okugenda naye ku ssomero.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
Everything is important.	Buli kintu kyonna kikulu.
I think he just wants to talk to me.	Ndowooza ayagala kwogera nange nzekka.
He didn’t have to tell anyone.	Yali talina kubuulira muntu yenna.
You don't have anything important.	Tolina kikulu.
It was something like him.	Kyali kintu nga ye.
My wife came with me.	Mukyala wange yajja nange.
There is no one	Tewali muntu yenna .
What do you want! 	Oyagala ki!
I want to work.	Njagala kukola.
And he wasn’t going to eat much during that time.	Era mu kiseera ekyo yali tagenda kulya nnyo.
I don’t want to do it too soon.	Saagala kukikola mangu.
Something like this .	Ekintu nga kino .
My father was happy.	Taata yali musanyufu.
I had no expectations.	Nnali sirina kye nnali nsuubira.
Now I have hope.	Kati nnina essuubi.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
My wife is happy.	Mukyala wange musanyufu.
I'll wait in the back.	Nja kulinda emabega.
This is a daunting task.	Guno mulimu gwa maanyi nnyo.
That doesn’t seem entirely true.	Ekyo kirabika si kituufu ddala.
There is only you.	Waliwo ggwe wekka.
I’m not sure when it started.	Sikakasa ddi lwe yatandika.
I have a friend down there.	Nnina mukwano gwange wansi awo.
he is probably.	ye oboolyawo.
But whatever, moving forward.	Naye kyonna, okugenda mu maaso.
He is really very good.	Ddala mulungi nnyo.
Same as before.	Kye kimu nga bwe kyali emabegako.
You won’t be able to.	Tojja kusobola.
It’s not too difficult.	Si kizibu nnyo.
Forward, backward.	Okugenda mu maaso, okudda emabega.
To be the best he could be.	Okubeera asinga obulungi gwe yali asobola okuba.
Now he loves it.	Kati ayagala nnyo.
He will stay that way.	Ajja kusigala bw’atyo.
You need to talk to him now.	Olina okwogera naye kati.
This was a good thing.	Kino kyali kirungi.
We need to regain our strength.	Tulina okuddamu amaanyi.
Nothing, or not at all.	Tewali kintu kyonna, oba si bwe kiri n’akatono.
It might be, it won’t be.	Kiyinza okuba, si kijja kuba.
However, he had no choice.	Kyokka, yali talina kya kukola.
I feel empowered.	Mpulira nga nfunye amaanyi.
Maybe that's it, baby.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kiri mwana wange.
She needed to be his image.	Yali yeetaaga okuba ekifaananyi kye.
They were always on duty.	Bulijjo baali ku mulimu.
We are the only ones.	Ffe tuli ffekka.
We’re going now.	Tugenda kati.
And that’s not true.	Era ekyo si kituufu.
I think you want something like that.	Ndowooza oyagala ekintu nga ekyo.
There is no urgency here.	Wano tewali bwangu.
That’s what’s important to me.	Ekyo kye kikulu gyendi.
In the evening.	Akawungeezi.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
You have to do this every day.	Kino olina okukikola buli lunaku.
I needed to move on.	Nnali nneetaaga okugenda mu maaso.
But he wasn’t thinking.	Naye yali talowooza.
At that time he will be very good.	Mu kiseera ekyo ajja kuba mulungi nnyo.
Who would be himself.	Ani yandibadde ye kennyini.
Now they were both.	Kati baali bombi.
This view is not uncommon.	Endowooza eno si ya bulijjo.
Anything can happen.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo.
I feel like it is.	Mpulira nga bwe kiri.
In theory, he could do whatever he wanted.	Mu ndowooza, yali asobola okukola kyonna kye yali ayagala.
He certainly did.	Mazima ddala yakikola.
He has to be at home.	Alina okuba awaka.
Nothing to do but talk.	Tewali kya kukola okuggyako okwogera.
He was my father.	Yali taata wange.
I can answer that.	Ekyo nsobola okuddamu.
And now the dog.	Era kati embwa.
He was still a child.	Yali akyali mwana muto.
In fact, this is quite true.	Mu butuufu, kino kye kituufu ennyo.
We are all in this together.	Ffenna tuli mu kino nga tuli wamu.
It was the same place.	Kyali kifo kye kimu.
A really nice guy.	Ggaayi omulungi ddala.
I didn’t know exactly.	Nnali simanyi bulungi.
He wasn't supposed to be here.	Yali talina kubeera wano.
I’ll come to you.	Nja kujja gy’oli.
Here is a picture.	Wano waliwo ekifaananyi.
I can be alone.	Nsobola okubeera nzekka.
He is one and all.	Ye omu era byonna.
Everyone said they loved the food.	Buli omu yagamba nti ayagala nnyo emmere.
And the beating continues.	Era okukuba kugenda mu maaso.
That’s what I think.	Kye ndowooza.
He must have prayed alone.	Ateekwa okuba nga yasaba yekka.
It’s his hometown, as well.	Kye kibuga kye, nga bwe kiri.
He went to work.	Yagenda ku mulimu.
That's why he can't talk.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tasobola kwogera.
But no you are at the movies.	Naye nedda oli ku firimu.
Same thing with me.	Ekintu kye kimu ne nange.
And this can be very difficult.	Era kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
You, more than anything.	Ggwe, okusinga ekintu kyonna.
But we have it.	Naye tulina.
I love how it looks.	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kirabika.
Good thing, he was a man.	Kirungi, yali musajja.
You were always the same.	Bulijjo wali bwe wali.
He did this.	Kino yakikola.
Or nothing he wanted to do.	Oba tewali kye yali ayagala kukola.
Every room in that house.	Buli kisenge mu nnyumba eyo.
There is no policy whatsoever.	Tewali nkola yonna.
I hope this is easy, helpful.	Nsuubira nti kino kyangu, kya buyambi.
But he doesn’t have it.	Naye talina.
I feel like it’s coming.	Mpulira nga kijja.
That was as it should be.	Ekyo kyali nga bwe kyandibadde.
This was his thing.	Kino kye kyali ekintu kye.
He was as sick as she was.	Yali mulwadde nga ye.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
But this is not an issue.	Naye kino si nsonga.
We’re fine here.	Tuli bulungi wano.
Everyone was working hard.	Buli omu yali akola nnyo.
He is a real doctor.	Ye musawo ddala.
But, you know.	Naye, omanyi.
In something, in any case.	Mu kintu, mu mbeera yonna.
I wonder why.	Nneebuuza lwaki.
You never know if famine is imminent.	Tomanyi oba enjala eri kumpi.
You have to think hard.	Olina okulowooza ennyo.
It’s not that he’s not a good man.	Si nti si musajja mulungi.
We have it a lot easier than he does.	Tulina nnyo nga kyangu okusinga ye.
I will work with him.	Nja kukola naye.
Not that he tried.	Si nti yagezaako.
That’s just not true.	Ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
Kiki, not even.	Kiki, si ani.
I thought it might happen.	Nalowooza nti kiyinza okubaawo.
It seems like it will do the job well.	Kirabika kijja kukola bulungi omulimu.
But it’s not exactly easy.	Naye si kyangu ddala.
It’s not just the city.	Si kibuga kyokka.
Isn't that all that matters?.	Ekyo kyokka si kye kikulu?.
He did this for a long time.	Kino yakikola okumala ebbanga ddene.
And yes, he does trouble.	Era ye, akola obuzibu.
And why shouldn’t he.	Era lwaki tasaanidde kukikola.
And you can, too.	Era naawe osobola.
He hoped she was okay.	Yalina essuubi nti yali bulungi.
He has no idea what it is.	Talina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki.
Yeah, of course.	Ye, ddala.
It's what he has.	Kye ky'alina.
There is no reason for him to move on.	Tewali nsonga lwaki agenda mu maaso.
That’s what I think.	Kye ndowooza.
You and I, and everyone.	Nze naawe, na buli muntu.
There was something he had to do.	Waliwo ekintu kye yalina okukola.
But it’s not, and it’s not.	Naye si bwe kiri, era si bwe kiri.
They are in the room.	Bali mu kisenge.
But no one can.	Naye tewali ayinza.
But your point is good.	Naye ensonga yo nnungi.
And that’s the problem here.	Era ekyo kye kizibu wano.
I am a single man.	Nze ndi musajja omu.
He wants that food.	Ayagala emmere eyo.
I want it now.	Njagala kati.
That was all he knew.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali amanyi.
Not this week.	Si wiiki eno.
He couldn’t wait.	Yali tasobola kulinda.
He seems to be the only one.	Alabika nga ye yekka.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
Maybe you don’t even know who.	Mpozzi nga tomanyi na ani.
There is a theory behind it all.	Waliwo endowooza emabega wa byonna.
But it’s pretty good.	Naye kirungi nnyo.
No one really wants to know.	Tewali ayagala ddala kumanya.
No one talks about him.	Tewali ayogera ku ye.
Nothing, maybe.	Tewali kintu kyonna, mpozzi.
It can be helpful.	Kiyinza okuyamba.
You don’t have a job.	Tolina mulimu.
It could be a friend of my father.	Kiyinza okuba mukwano gwa taata.
What do you think.	Ndowooza otya.
It felt so real.	Yawulira nga wa ddala nnyo.
No, that’s not all.	Nedda, ekyo si kye kyokka.
I think that’s absolutely true.	Ndowooza ekyo kituufu ddala.
But that’s a terrible idea.	Naye ekyo kirowoozo kibi nnyo.
This was very difficult and expensive.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo era nga kya ssente nnyingi.
It’s all one process.	Byonna nkola emu.
Happy but energetic.	Musanyufu naye nga alina amaanyi.
I knew he could.	Nnali nkimanyi nti asobola.
You think about him all the time.	Olowooza ku ye buli kiseera.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
That’s what it is, of course.	Ekyo kye kiri, ddala.
He was right in front.	Yali mu maaso ddala.
All the stuff.	Ebintu byonna.
Not on it.	Si ku yo.
I am happy here right now.	Ndi musanyufu wano mu kiseera kino.
Good, good!' 	Kirungi, kirungi!’.
This is actually simple.	Kino mu butuufu kyangu.
He must have been very lonely.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali yekka nnyo.
I'll be fine though.	Nja kuba bulungi wadde.
No one is alone.	Tewali ali yekka.
It was really great.	Ddala kyali kikulu nnyo.
He is not a father and wishes he could be.	Si taata era ayagala nnyo okuba.
It was completely reversible.	Yali ya kuddamu ddala.
I loved that thing.	Ekintu ekyo nnali njagala nnyo.
Like, not at all.	Nga, si bwe kiri n’akatono.
But in the morning he would do well.	Naye ku makya yandikoze bulungi.
I have trouble being alone.	Nnina ekizibu okubeera nzekka.
This picture is not entirely accurate.	Ekifaananyi kino si kituufu ddala.
We will be friends.	Tujja kuba ba mukwano.
It’s not necessarily the same.	Si kituufu nti kye kimu.
Here we are.	Wano we tuli.
But he was the one.	Naye ye yali.
He couldn’t tell.	Yali tasobola kumanya.
I just couldn’t do it.	Nze nali sisobola kukikola.
It would be morning soon.	Kyandibadde ku makya mu bbanga ttono.
He was so close, but no, he's fine.	Yali kumpi nnyo, naye nedda, ali bulungi.
Everyone has to buy.	Buli muntu alina okugula.
He is a very nice man.	Ye musajja omulungi ennyo.
But that was not the case here.	Naye wano si bwe kyali.
I have been a bit busy.	Mbadde bbize katono.
I knew why.	Nnali mmanyi lwaki.
He didn’t want to do anything.	Yali tayagala kukola kintu kyonna.
I thought, how true.	Nalowooza nti, nga kituufu nnyo.
We don’t have any money.	Tetulina ssente yonna.
He felt unable to do anything immediately.	Yawulira nga tasobola kukola kintu kyonna mu bwangu.
I really can’t wait for that!.	Mazima ddala ekyo siyinza kulinda!.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
It was a difficult time, indeed.	Kyali kiseera kizibu, ddala.
No one really knows.	Mu butuufu tewali amanyi.
It had no place whatsoever.	Tewali kifo kyonna kyalina.
He is what he is, a person.	Ye ky’ali, omuntu.
He spoke very quickly.	Yayogera mangu nnyo.
I have to work, he thought.	Nnina okukola, bwe yalowooza.
I have no idea if this is unusual or not.	Sirina kye mmanyi oba kino si kya bulijjo oba nedda.
And at home.	Ne awaka.
Are you .	Ye ggwe .
We'll go tonight.	Tujja kugenda ekiro kino.
But, of course, that won’t work.	Naye, kya lwatu, ekyo tekijja kukola.
But this is not true.	Naye kino si kituufu.
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika nga si kituufu.
Or out of order, or something.	Oba okuva mu nteekateeka, oba ekintu kyonna.
I still don’t know.	N’okutuusa kati simanyi.
Not at any time.	Si mu kiseera kyonna.
It seems so long ago.	Kirabika dda nnyo.
It had to be good.	Yalina okuba obulungi.
Now you want to talk.	Kati oyagala kwogera.
And we could see .	Era twali tusobola okulaba .
Maybe maybe maybe.	Mpozzi mpozzi mpozzi.
What a beautiful sight.	Nga kirungi nnyo.
He wasn’t happy.	Yali si musanyufu.
He wants to say so much.	Ayagala okwogera bingi nnyo.
I can’t quite believe that.	Ekyo sisobola bulungi kukkiriza.
Actually, there is no reason.	Mu butuufu, tewali nsonga yonna.
He will just do it.	Ajja kukola kyokka.
He is a doctor.	Ye musawo.
He is my everything.	Ye buli kimu kyange.
It’s easy to get here.	Kyangu okutuuka wano.
But it’s pretty good.	Naye kirungi nnyo.
It had to be very difficult.	Kyalina okuba nga kizibu nnyo.
No one is like that.	Tewali muntu yenna bw’atyo.
You can’t do this.	Kino tosobola kukikola.
I think you will.	Ndowooza ojja kukikola.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
However, no one can do it.	Kyokka, tewali asobola kukikola.
That it would be fine.	Nti kyandibadde bulungi.
And driving out at night .	Era okuvuga okugenda ekiro .
Anyone at the hospital could have done it.	Omuntu yenna ku ddwaaliro yali asobola okukikola.
It’s up to us.	Kiri eri ffe.
You have to go home.	Olina okudda eka.
It was very beautiful.	Yali nnungi nnyo.
Good in the hospital.	Kirungi mu ddwaaliro.
He was stronger than that.	Yali wa maanyi okusinga ekyo.
He has no idea of ​​his role.	Talina kirowoozo kyonna ku kifo kye.
Anyone else can do the same.	Omuntu omulala yenna asobola okukola kye kimu.
I needed to do this.	Kino nnali nneetaaga okukola.
Everyone down there.	Buli muntu wansi awo.
We can’t get anything.	Tetusobola kufuna kintu kyonna.
I’m not completely ready.	Nze siri mwetegefu ddala.
That’s not really the point.	Eyo si y’ensonga mu butuufu.
This is all it is.	Kino kyonna kye kiri.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
He seemed happy and so did his wife.	Yalabika nga musanyufu era ne mukyala we naye.
But he has no problem.	Naye talina buzibu.
He was like his brother.	Yali nga muganda we.
I didn’t want anything.	Nnali sirina kye njagala.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
I hope to talk to you soon.	Nsuubira okwogera naawe mu bbanga ttono.
And yet, too.	Era naye, naye.
My wife is a lovely person.	Mukyala wange muntu ayagala nnyo.
He is the one who should be in jail.	Ye oyo alina okubeera mu kkomera.
I like how it comes across, though.	Njagala nnyo engeri gye kijja, wadde.
It won’t go away.	Tekijja kugenda.
We just have to do this.	Kino tulina okukikola kyokka.
This is very powerful.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo.
It’s hard to say which.	Kizibu okwogera ki.
I’m sure it was.	Nkakasa nti bwe kyali.
Knowledge is a factor.	Okumanya nsonga.
It was probably true.	Oboolyawo kyali kituufu.
Maybe it’s just me.	Mpozzi nze nzekka.
He was trying to work.	Yali agezaako okukola.
At the office this morning.	Ku ofiisi enkya ya leero.
A little too quickly.	Katono nnyo mu bwangu.
He had already moved on.	Yali yagenda dda mu maaso.
But not in the car together, now.	Naye si mu mmotoka nga tuli wamu, kati.
He doesn’t want to do it.	Tayagala kukikola.
It’s not a one-man problem.	Si kizibu kya muntu omu.
I couldn’t be alone.	Nnali sisobola kubeera nzekka.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
This seems like a pretty common practice, actually.	Kino kirabika nga nkola ya bulijjo nnyo, mu butuufu.
It’s just a sin.	Kibi kyokka.
He was always alone.	Bulijjo yali yekka.
And in a way, that’s true.	Era mu ngeri emu, ekyo kituufu.
Everything is fine now.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi kati.
I'm not so sure now.	Sikakasa nnyo kati.
He would have gone alone.	Yandibadde agenda yekka.
No one goes to jail.	Tewali agenda mu kkomera.
I don’t want to be that.	Nze saagala kubeera ekyo.
In many ways, it was.	Mu ngeri nnyingi, bwe kyali.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
I have always been me.	Bulijjo mbadde nze.
On this we have absolutely nothing.	Ku nsonga eno tetulina kye tulina n'akatono.
We were really good friends.	Twali ba mukwano nnyo ddala.
I want to find my way.	Njagala kufuna ngeri yange.
I was an artist of course.	Nali muyimbi mazima ddala.
In the meantime, there is hope.	Mu kiseera kino, waliwo essuubi.
Here, in this house, here we are.	Wano, mu nnyumba eno, wano we tuli.
We’ll both do it.	Ffembi tujja kukikola.
It is absolutely true.	Kituufu ddala.
And getting to the point.	Era okutuuka ku nsonga.
Something is definitely happening.	Waliwo ekintu ekigenda mu maaso ddala.
That was a great idea.	Ekyo kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
It will not work .	Tekijja kukola .
You have to do that every day.	Ekyo olina okukikola buli lunaku.
But that wasn’t what he was thinking.	Naye ekyo si kye yali alowooza.
He knew what he needed.	Yali amanyi kye yali yeetaaga.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
He would deal with the truth as he knew it.	Yandikoze ku mazima nga bwe yali amanyi.
No one had been able to.	Tewali yali abadde asobola.
Everything seems so complicated.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kizibu nnyo.
I’m sure we’ll find time to talk.	Nkakasa nti tujja kufuna obudde okwogera.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
Can anyone help?.	Waliwo asobola okuyamba?.
I had no one to answer to.	Nnali sirina gwe nnyinza kuddamu.
That's good at that.	Ekyo mulungi mu ekyo.
And he couldn’t believe it.	Era yali tasobola kukkiriza.
Someone had to go.	Waliwo omuntu yalina okugenda.
I didn’t even want to be in the same room.	Nnali saagala na kubeera mu kisenge kimu.
I don’t really like this.	Kino sikyagala nnyo.
I think we should go.	Ndowooza tusaanidde okugenda.
However, it wasn’t.	Kyokka, si bwe kyali.
I'll do that tomorrow.	Ekyo nja kukikola enkya.
He must have had it too.	Ateekwa okuba nga yalina naye.
I have to get home.	Nnina okutuuka awaka.
I work with the police.	Nkola ne poliisi.
There are many reasons.	Waliwo ensonga nnyingi.
However, he was handsome.	Kyokka yali alabika bulungi.
But you can’t be human right now.	Naye tosobola kuba muntu mu kiseera kino.
He is a man who has been in the industry.	Ye musajja amaze mu mulimu guno.
And maybe that’s the point.	Era mpozzi eyo y’ensonga.
Not working with you.	Si kukola naawe.
Or what they were.	Oba kye baali.
And it’s great to see.	Era kirungi nnyo okulaba.
Now might be the time.	Kati kiyinza okuba nga kye kiseera.
And he wants you.	Era ayagala ggwe.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Kyokka, si kikulu.
He's just a kid.	Ye mwana muto yekka.
I am also very fast.	Nze nange ndi wa bwangu nnyo.
He is not a child.	Si mwana muto.
Which he did his job in many cases.	Kye yakola omulimu gwe mu mbeera nnyingi.
This was not the case here.	Wano si bwe kyali.
They’re on to something.	Bali ku kintu.
Which he always did.	Kye yali akola bulijjo.
Like, of course.	Nga, ddala.
This is not true at all.	Kino si kituufu n’akatono.
It was a beautiful place.	Kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
I have a picture.	Nnina ekifaananyi.
I'll try it now.	Nja kugezaako kati.
. . . .	.
You will just be there.	Ojja kumala kubeerawo.
It was almost true, anyway.	Kumpi kyali kituufu, mu ngeri yonna.
And the problem was serious.	Era ekizibu kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
Not that he was without problems.	Si nti yali talina buzibu.
No one thought anyone would come here.	Tewali yalowooza nti waliwo omuntu yenna ajja kujja wano.
His work here is excellent.	Omulimu gwe wano mulungi nnyo.
It was, himself.	Yali, ye kennyini.
He loved my work.	Yali ayagala nnyo omulimu gwange.
There are so many reasons.	Waliwo ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
You can’t do this.	Kino tosobola kukikola.
I do like that.	Nze nkola nga bwe kiri.
But you don’t know how to do that.	Naye tomanyi ngeri ya kukola ekyo.
This is happening every day.	Kino kigenda mu maaso buli lunaku.
And then what .	Era awo kiki .
I wanted to see if we could go down.	Nnali njagala okulaba oba tusobola okugenda wansi.
You’re going home.	Ogenda waka.
Today they are everywhere.	Leero bali buli wamu.
More than enough, he thought.	Okusinga okumala, yalowooza.
It’s really down.	Ddala kiri wansi.
Indeed, it is difficult.	Mazima ddala, kizibu.
But now you know better.	Naye kati ggwe omanyi bulungi.
I can’t wait here.	Siyinza kulinda wano.
He said, what do you want.	N’agamba nti, oyagala ki.
As he was doing.	Nga bwe yali akola.
This is his job.	Guno gwe mulimu gwe.
It’s a little difficult.	Kizibu katono.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
Though not for long.	Wadde nga si kya bbanga ddene.
He was still here.	Yali akyali wano.
He was obviously ready to go.	Kya lwatu nti yali mwetegefu okugenda.
It was a very important one.	Kyali kikulu nnyo.
I think it was just beautiful.	Ndowooza nti kyali kirungi kyokka.
But that is not always the case.	Naye si bwe kiri bulijjo.
But not for him.	Naye si lwa ye.
Obviously, it was serious.	Kya lwatu nti kyali kya maanyi.
However, you	Kyokka ggwe .
It was dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe.
I will be with you.	Nja kuba naawe.
And it can be low.	Era kiyinza okuba nga kya wansi.
It is down to us.	Kiri wansi gye tuli.
No one wanted to.	Tewali yali ayagala.
And it was true, in a way.	Era kyali kituufu, mu ngeri emu.
That’s all we have right now.	Ekyo kyokka kye tulina mu kiseera kino.
But no one knew.	Naye tewali yali amanyi.
No one on the.	Tewali muntu yenna ku...
But he had a job to do.	Naye yalina omulimu gwe yakola.
My father was a doctor.	Taata yali musawo.
He would like that .	Ekyo yandiyagadde .
I think we have the same.	Ndowooza naffe tulina kye kimu.
And it was better than being home alone.	Era kyali kirungi okusinga okubeera wekka awaka.
For him, he could do that.	Ku ye, ekyo yali asobola okukikola.
And it won’t happen.	Era tekijja kubaawo.
She was fun to talk to and very efficient.	Yali musanyufu okwogera naye era ng’akola bulungi nnyo.
Obviously not.	Kya lwatu si bwe kiri.
That’s exactly what it was.	Ekyo ddala kye kyali.
He didn’t need it.	Yali teyeetaaga.
But this wasn’t always the case for me.	Naye kino si bwe kyali bulijjo gyendi.
That’s not the case this week.	Ekyo si bwe kiri wiiki eno.
No, now is the time to do it.	Nedda, kati kye kiseera okukikola.
Not exactly the case.	Si bwe kiri ddala.
I work hard.	Nkola nnyo.
He worked hard, such a good person.	Yakola nnyo, omuntu omulungi bw’atyo.
This was his room.	Kino kye kyali kisenge kye.
And he couldn’t do it.	Era yali tasobola kukikola.
But, they are not.	Naye, si bwe bali.
But he is a very good player.	Naye muzannyi mulungi nnyo.
I want it right now.	Njagala mu kiseera kino.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
We have something to do.	Tulina kye tulina okukola.
I needed to get out of here.	Nnali nneetaaga okuva wano.
Or as it was.	Oba nga bwe kyali.
He prayed that was true.	Yasaba ekyo kituufu.
You don’t want to see.	Toyagala kulaba.
Always, always good.	Bulijjo, bulijjo mulungi.
Not much really for me, but for them.	Si bingi ddala gyendi, naye gye bali.
It will be will not believe.	Kijja kuba tekijja kukkiriza.
Or you’re thinking too much.	Oba olowooza nnyo.
But you don’t want to be here.	Naye toyagala kubeera wano.
But you.	Naye ggwe.
But here it was.	Naye wano we kyali.
This is a good practice.	Eno nkola nnungi.
But you don’t have to come with me.	Naye tolina kujja nange.
Everything was happening so fast.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
It was a situation.	Yali mbeera.
And there was .	Era nga waliwo .
To me you were my friend.	Eri nze wali mukwano gwange.
He is still here.	Akyali wano.
There is no party organization.	Tewali kibiina kya kibiina.
They were an hour behind.	Baali emabega essaawa emu.
No one could believe it.	Tewali yali asobola kukkiriza.
We were there, all of us, all morning.	Twali awo, ffenna, enkya yonna.
Indeed, there is probably every reason why he should be.	Mazima ddala, oboolyawo waliwo ensonga yonna lwaki yandibadde bw’atyo.
He told me that	Yang’amba nti .
He's in here all the time, too.	Ali mu wano buli kiseera, naye.
And it really isn’t.	Era mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
The age is yes.	Si ye ye.
We all have a role to play here.	Ffenna tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola wano.
He is a good child.	Ye mwana mulungi.
Or, maybe it’s just me.	Oba, mpozzi nze nzekka.
It’s not, it’s not the way it is for us.	Si bwe kiri, si ngeri gye kiri gye tuli.
He knows there is no one here.	Akimanyi nti wano tewali muntu yenna.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
You belonged to the past.	Ggwe wali wa dda.
So far, pretty good .	N’okutuusa kati, kirungi nnyo .
And it’s absolutely true.	Era kituufu ddala.
He didn’t even want to be alone.	Yali tayagala na kubeera yekka.
He was like that even as a kid.	Yali bw’atyo ne bwe yali akyali mwana muto.
I really wanted that.	Ekyo nnali njagala nnyo.
This is why we are there until now.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki tuli awo okutuuka kati.
You have to do it yourself.	Olina okukikola wekka.
But this is very unusual.	Naye kino si kya bulijjo nnyo.
You can do it your way too.	Osobola okukikola mu ngeri yo naawe.
I have to turn off here, now.	Nnina okuggyako wano, kati.
It was the same time.	Kyali kiseera kye kimu.
But he knows this is not entirely true.	Naye akimanyi nti kino si kituufu ddala.
I don’t have time for this right now.	Kino sirina budde mu kiseera kino.
I was very sick.	Nnali mulwadde nnyo.
There is certainly no problem doing it.	Mazima ddala tewali buzibu kukikola.
Where he was or was.	Gye yali oba gye yali.
Everyone knows everything.	Buli omu amanyi buli kimu.
He was nobody.	Yali si muntu yenna.
I need to get home too.	Nange nneetaaga okutuuka awaka.
I feel like she is my wife already.	Mpulira nga ye mukyala wange dda.
It’s not a good feeling.	Si mpulira nnungi.
And he was going to go see.	Era yali agenda kugenda okulaba.
Probably a good thing he did.	Oboolyawo kintu kirungi kye yakola.
But he didn’t want to stay.	Naye yali tayagala kusigala.
Why, there he is, now.	Lwaki, eyo ali, kati.
Everyone thinks you’re on to something.	Buli omu alowooza nti oli ku kintu.
But it’s not mine.	Naye si kyange.
I wanted to go.	Nnali njagala kugenda.
Now that will be very important.	Kati ekyo kijja kuba kikulu nnyo.
This is my place.	Kino kye kifo kyange.
I will definitely do it.	Ddala nja kukikola.
He felt very comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo.
It’s actually very, very difficult.	Mu butuufu kizibu nnyo, nnyo.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
My father knows it too.	Taata naye akimanyi.
How you loved it so much.	Nga wali oyagala nnyo.
I love your opinion.	Njagala nnyo endowooza yo.
Not him, not now.	Si ye, si kati.
I can’t find a job.	Sisobola kufuna mulimu.
That could be anything.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
Really, so many.	Ddala, bingi nnyo.
That was me too.	Oyo nange nnali.
It is dangerous and dangerous.	Kya bulabe era kya bulabe.
That's one thing for me.	Ekyo ekintu kimu nze.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
How are you, what have you been doing?.	Oli otya, obadde okola ki?.
He thought he could last a week.	Yalowooza nti asobola okumala wiiki emu.
A lot of that is a good way.	Bingi ku ebyo ngeri nnungi.
On and on you go.	Ku ne ku ggwe ogenda.
No, it’s not, really.	Nedda, si bwe kiri, ddala.
I'm not quite sure how he did that.	Sikakasa bulungi ngeri gye yakola ekyo.
This is what I was thinking at the time.	Bino bye nnali ndowooza mu kiseera ekyo.
No one knew who he was.	Tewali yali amanyi ani.
I really wanted that.	Ekyo nnali njagala nnyo.
I hope you will agree.	Nsuubira nti ojja kukkiriza.
It was as simple as can be.	Kyali kyangu nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
Very very very alone.	Nnyo nnyo nnyo yekka.
I always want to.	Njagala bulijjo.
I feel things.	Nze mpulira ebintu.
This is the work of the congregation.	Guno gwe mulimu gwa kibiina.
To do it right.	Okukikola obulungi.
Winning is not easy.	Okuwangula si kyangu.
Now, we’re going to see.	Kati, tugenda kulaba.
I don’t know where to go.	Simanyi gye nnyinza kugenda.
He has to go to work.	Alina okugenda ku mulimu.
The house looked very ordinary.	Ennyumba yalabika nga ya bulijjo nnyo.
It’s really true.	Ddala kituufu.
I know you don’t want to drive back with me.	Nkimanyi nti toyagala kuvuga kudda nange.
No one really does that except us.	Ekyo ddala tewali akikola okuggyako ffe.
He said he would be right down.	Yagamba nti ajja kuba wansi ddala.
Apparently, this can work in many cases.	Kirabika kino kiyinza okukola mu mbeera nnyingi.
I am a practicing physician.	Ndi musawo akola.
He always knew it.	Bulijjo yali akimanyi.
We’re going home.	Tugenda waka.
Maybe they are.	Mpozzi nga bwe bali.
All in the last hour.	Byonna mu ssaawa ewedde.
But there is something.	Naye waliwo ekintu.
Actually, that’s a good point.	Mu butuufu, eyo nsonga nnungi.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
He didn’t want to talk about it.	Yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eno.
In the evening.	Akawungeezi.
It’s hard, and for a very long time.	Kizibu, era okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
It’s not always good.	Si kirungi bulijjo.
Not to anyone.	Si eri omuntu yenna.
And this is very unusual.	Era kino si kya bulijjo nnyo.
But always for me.	Naye bulijjo gyendi.
And what plans today.	Era enteekateeka ki leero.
You think everyone should be like you.	Olowooza buli muntu yandibadde nga ggwe.
That was a real thing.	Ekyo kyali kintu kya ddala.
He knew that too.	Ne ye ekyo yali akimanyi.
I’m going to town tomorrow.	Ngenda mu kibuga enkya.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
I don’t know what I’m doing.	Nze simanyi kiki kye nkola.
He's afraid though.	Atya wadde.
It was a matter of regaining strength.	Yali nsonga ya kuddamu kufuna maanyi.
Don’t go alone.	Togenda wekka.
One can imagine that.	Omuntu asobola okulowooza ku ekyo.
He should have known better.	Yandibadde amanyi bulungi.
You definitely don’t want to do this.	Mazima ddala kino toyagala kukikola.
He is at home.	Ali waka.
I hope he will do it.	Nsuubira nti ajja kukikola.
Anyone can do it in an hour.	Omuntu yenna asobola okukikola mu ssaawa emu.
You really .	Ggwe ddala .
And it will happen again.	Era kijja kuddamu okubaawo.
Whatever she needed.	Kyonna kye yali yeetaaga.
We were each other.	Twali buli omu.
I want to talk to you.	Njagala kwogera naawe.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
He talks to her.	Ayogera naye.
Like all of us.	Nga ffenna.
He was living with us at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali abeera naffe.
You’re the reason.	Ggwe ensonga.
But he is he is.	Naye ye ye.
He had to know the facts.	Yalina okumanya ensonga.
In theory it looks great.	Mu ndowooza kirabika bulungi nnyo.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
And he can’t work out why.	Era tasobola kukola ku nsonga lwaki.
Whatever you want.	Kyonna ky’oyagala.
But that wasn’t it.	Naye ekyo si kye kyali.
I will buy again.	Nja kuddamu okugula.
And of course that’s a good thing.	Era ddala ekyo kintu kirungi.
And it was, for a while.	Era bwe kyali, okumala akaseera.
He had to go.	Yalina okugenda.
And it’s very important.	Era kikulu nnyo.
Maybe he was alone here.	Mpozzi nga wano yali yekka.
Maybe it will come back.	Mpozzi kijja kudda.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
That’s up to me.	Ekyo kiri eri nze.
He needed time.	Yali yeetaaga obudde.
I know you would like that.	Nkimanyi ekyo wandyagadde.
From him? 	Okuva ku ye?
But it’s difficult.	Naye kizibu.
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
And it’s not really mine.	Era mu butuufu si yange.
I think it might be.	Ndowooza kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
I was in pretty good shape.	Nali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
He would have no reason to.	Yandibadde talina nsonga lwaki.
I love this product.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino.
He was powerless.	Yali talina maanyi.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si ekyo kyokka.
The picture is beautiful.	Ekifaananyi kirungi nnyo.
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
He is very vocal about it.	Ye muyimbi nnyo ku nsonga eno.
But that’s going to happen.	Naye ekyo kigenda kubaawo.
You just don’t know.	Ggwe kyokka tomanyi.
You know you are a lucky woman.	Omanyi oli mukyala wa mukisa.
He wasn’t being himself.	Yali si kubeera ye kennyini.
You want to do it right.	Oyagala okukikola obulungi.
It was waiting.	Kyali kulinda.
That is so far.	Ekyo kiri okutuusa kati.
I was a kid at the time.	Nze nali mwana muto mu kiseera ekyo.
He heard nothing.	Tewali kye yawulira.
This view is not entirely true.	Endowooza eno si ya mazima ddala.
No one works harder than he does.	Tewali akola nnyo okusinga ye.
He felt very comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo.
I couldn’t do that before.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola emabegako.
You know it’s true.	Omanyi nti kituufu.
It’s not really you.	Mu butuufu si ggwe.
However, I want to help.	Kyokka njagala kuyamba.
He says it is very important.	Agamba nti kikulu nnyo.
It was a matter of love.	Yali nsonga ya kwagala.
I am like anyone else.	Nze nga omuntu yenna.
I won't be!.	Sijja kuba!.
And maybe watch a movie.	Era mpozzi okulaba firimu.
It was the truth, he thought.	Yali mazima, bwe yalowooza.
You’re alone.	Oli wekka.
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
I don't know what you really want to do.	Simanyi kyoyagala kukola ddala.
It’s not a problem at all.	Si kizibu n’akatono.
We are here together.	Tuli wano wamu.
You know what that’s like.	Omanyi ekyo bwe kiri.
He knew there was.	Yali akimanyi nti waliwo.
It’s a little more complicated than that.	Kizibu katono okusinga ekyo.
I can’t see one thing.	Sisobola kulaba kintu kimu.
It was bad, very bad.	Kyali kibi, kibi nnyo.
Not happy, either.	Si musanyufu, era.
This is his room.	Kino kye kisenge kye.
I thought it was my turn.	Nalowooza nti kye kiseera kyange.
I think it’s very, very dangerous.	Ndowooza nti kya bulabe nnyo nnyo.
Or this afternoon.	Oba akawungeezi ka leero.
Now I have one.	Kati nnina emu.
I needed a best friend.	Nnali nneetaaga mukwano gwange asinga.
And he is my best friend.	Era mukwano gwange nnyo.
We can do that now.	Ekyo tusobola okukikola kati.
Now we will repeat.	Kati tujja kuddamu okuddamu.
He certainly liked to eat alone.	Mazima ddala yali ayagala nnyo okulya yekka.
He is willing to be.	Ye mwetegefu okubeera bw’atyo.
You really are a good friend.	Ddala oli mukwano mulungi.
You have to do it really well.	Olina okukikola obulungi ddala.
. . . .	.
He was telling the truth.	Yali ayogera mazima.
He was at work.	Yali ku mulimu.
But, it’s hard to just leave the city.	Naye, kizibu okumala okuva mu kibuga.
He tried but couldn't.	Yagezaako naye nga tasobola.
He was doing it even though he wanted to.	Yali akikola wadde nga yali ayagala.
We needed a plan.	Twali twetaaga enteekateeka.
There is no one in the room.	Tewali muntu yenna mu kisenge.
It was a romantic thing.	Kyali kintu kya mukwano.
You have to talk to him.	Olina okwogera naye.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
We'll have to wait until tonight.	Tujja kulinda okutuusa ekiro kino.
It’s good and it’s bad.	Kirungi era kibi.
He should have known .	Yandibadde amanyi .
Apparently he was sound asleep.	Kirabika yali yeebase bulungi.
He was willing to work, as well.	Yali mwetegefu okukola, nga naye.
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
It was my turn to move on.	Kyali kiseera kyange okugenda mu maaso.
I love to talk.	Njagala nnyo okwogera.
I didn’t know what to do.	Nnali simanyi kya kukola.
No one but me.	Tewali muntu yenna okuggyako nze.
I was just happy to get out of town safely.	Nali musanyufu kyokka okuva mu kibuga nga sirina bulabe.
Maybe we’ll find another one.	Mpozzi tujja kufuna omulala.
Back to the room.	Okudda ku kisenge.
And she was gorgeous.	Era yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
We are homemakers.	Tuli ba waka.
You have to go back to see it all.	Olina okudda emabega okulaba byonna.
He was there, but not there.	Yali awo, naye si awo.
There is no factual basis for this.	Tewali nsonga ya mazima ku nsonga eno.
I hope this good work continues.	Nsuubira omulimu guno omulungi agenda mu maaso.
I’m not very good.	Nze siri mulungi nnyo.
It’s time to move on, for both of us.	Kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso, eri ffembi.
I’m down here now.	Nze ndi wansi wano kati.
I am really afraid to drive this car.	Mazima ddala ntya okuvuga mmotoka eno.
The arrangement was excellent.	Enteekateeka yali nnungi nnyo.
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
But maybe he had a point.	Naye mpozzi yalina ensonga.
It’s not good .	Si kirungi .
That’s not your issue.	Ekyo si nsonga yo.
He might think she’s his girlfriend.	Ayinza okulowooza nti muganzi we.
We are friends.	Tuli ba mukwano.
Someone wants to do that .	Waliwo ayagala okukola ekyo .
It was a real situation.	Yali mbeera ya ddala.
As he should have been.	Nga bwe yandibadde.
Not much.	Si bingi.
This is why we have dogs.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki tulina embwa.
He was a lucky man.	Yali musajja wa mukisa.
Are you sure you want to continue?.	Okakasa nti oyagala kugenda mu maaso?.
Tonight is for you.	Ekiro kya leero kya ggwe.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
I need to do this myself.	Kino nneetaaga okukikola nze kennyini.
He makes films.	Akola firimu.
As it was when .	Nga bwe kyali nga .
Nothing at all, actually.	Tewali n’akatono, mu butuufu.
I want the reason.	Njagala ensonga.
He didn't know how to answer.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ya kuddamu.
I am ready to know now.	Ndi mwetegefu okumanya kati.
It’s not too bad.	Si kibi nnyo.
And now you do too.	Era kati naawe okola.
You’re his father.	Ggwe taata we.
You can’t though.	Tosobola wadde.
I guess he has a lot.	Ntebereza nti alina bingi.
And of course .	Era ddala .
But no one will do it.	Naye tewali ajja kukikola.
You probably couldn’t do it now.	Oboolyawo kati wali tosobola kukikola.
This was powerful, perhaps too powerful.	Kino kyali kya maanyi, mpozzi nga kya maanyi nnyo.
Maybe it’s a movie location.	Mpozzi nga kifo kya firimu.
It can be a bad thing.	Kiyinza okuba nga kibi.
I love working alone.	Njagala nnyo okukola nzekka.
You’re going to come like us.	Ogenda kujja nga ffe.
I’m sure it’s true.	Nkakasa nti kituufu.
Lots of things, actually.	Ebintu bingi, mu butuufu.
That’s a very difficult place.	Eyo kifo kizibu nnyo.
I wonder why.	Nze nneebuuza lwaki.
It was coming for a long time.	Yali ejja okumala ebbanga ddene.
That’s not good, not good at all.	Ekyo si kirungi, si kirungi n’akatono.
Someone is making this happen.	Waliwo omuntu akola kino okubaawo.
I don’t like that at all.	Ekyo sikyagala n’akatono.
That he could buy.	Nti yali asobola okugula.
And there’s really nothing to do.	Era mu butuufu tewali kya kukola.
We have no issues.	Tetulina nsonga yonna.
It won’t matter at this point.	Tekijja kuba na nsonga mu kiseera kino.
Everyone knew that.	Ekyo buli omu yali akimanyi.
He doesn't know how to say this.	Kino tamanyi ngeri ya kwogera.
He is good to me that way.	Mulungi gyendi bw’atyo.
That's not' it.	Ekyo nedda' kye.
No one was in sight for a while.	Tewali yali alabika okumala akaseera.
I can’t speak properly.	Siyinza kwogera bulungi.
He didn’t really need one.	Mu butuufu yali teyeetaaga emu.
You have to go .	Olina okugenda .
But that’s not what matters.	Naye ekyo si kye kikulu.
For how long, he doesn’t know.	Okumala bbanga ki, tamanyi.
I’m going to do it right.	Ngenda kukikola bulungi.
He didn’t know the city.	Yali tamanyi kibuga.
It is a low class.	Kibiina kya wansi.
He was at my wedding.	Yali ku mbaga yange.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	Nja kwogera naawe enkya.
That would be right.	Ekyo kyandibadde kituufu.
He could not allow this to happen.	Kino yali tasobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
I don’t want to go back to the house.	Saagala kudda mu nnyumba.
I'm glad you are.	Ndi musanyufu nti ggwe.
She really looks good.	Ddala alabika bulungi.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
I hope he is okay.	Nsuubira nti ali bulungi.
The same goes for me.	Ekintu kye kimu kigenda ku nze.
You know, here, with me.	Omanyi, wano, nange.
I really don’t know anything.	Mazima ddala sirina kye mmanyi.
But this seems all or nothing.	Naye kino kirabika byonna oba nga tewali.
Going to do it quickly.	Okugenda okukikola amangu.
I know this very well.	Kino nkimanyi nnyo.
Nothing is happening.	Tewali kintu kyonna kigenda mu maaso.
No, there is no speech.	Nedda, tewali kwogera.
Driving here is intense.	Okuvuga wano kya maanyi.
Or someone like him.	Oba omuntu nga ye.
But that’s all he would be.	Naye ekyo kyokka kye yandibadde.
I’m at work.	Nze ndi ku mulimu.
Just like my brother did.	Nga muganda wange bwe yakola.
And this can happen in school.	Era kino kiyinza okubaawo ne mu ssomero.
I could go home.	Nnali nsobola okudda eka.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
There is only one.	Waliwo omu yekka.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
He is afraid that he knows too much.	Atya nti amanyi bingi nnyo.
He had no idea at the time.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiseera ekyo.
I couldn’t talk about it.	Nnali sisobola kwogera ku nsonga eno.
He did what he wanted.	Yakola kye yali ayagala.
I just know that they are.	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti bwe bali.
It’s really hard to see that.	Mazima ddala kizibu okulaba ekyo.
No one does this.	Kino tewali akikola.
He could think of what she could have said.	Yali asobola okulowooza ku ekyo kye yandibadde ayogera.
I just want to be with you.	Njagala kubeera naawe kyokka.
He is a very good child.	Ye mwana mulungi nnyo.
He knows everything.	Amanyi buli kimu.
He spoke to her like a friend.	Yayogera naye nga mukwano gwe.
This feature is very, very important.	Ekintu kino kikulu nnyo nnyo.
He would be fine.	Yandibadde bulungi.
I'm not so sure.	Sikakasa nnyo.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
But I'm not sure how to do that.	Naye sikakasa ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukola ekyo.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
No one said it was easy.	Tewali yagamba nti kyangu.
He lived among us as a friend.	Yali abeera mu ffe nga mukwano gwe.
I'll go now.	Nja kugenda kati.
I can’t wait to see.	Siyinza kulinda kulaba.
I feel so, so much.	Mpulira nnyo nnyo.
I know what it was.	Nkimanyi kye kyali.
He's a really nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi ddala.
Now, everything is fine.	Kati, buli kimu kiri bulungi.
You are one of us.	Ggwe omu ku ffe.
I deserved that too.	Ekyo nange nnali nsaanidde.
If he was asleep.	Singa yali yeebase.
I can’t do without you.	Siyinza kukola nga tolina ggwe.
It will be a joint initiative from now on.	Kijja kuba nteekateeka ya wamu okuva kati.
There was no way for him to know.	Tewali ngeri yonna gye yali ayinza kumanya.
You don’t know who.	Tomanyi ani.
But maybe you can.	Naye mpozzi osobola.
He won’t answer.	Tajja kuddamu.
He knew now.	Yali amanyi kati.
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
He knows exactly what they are.	Amanyi bulungi kye bali.
He's been here.	Abadde wano.
And this was very important.	Era kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
I’ll know if you’re not.	Nja kumanya oba toli.
It would be awkward for me.	Kyandibadde kya buzibu gyendi.
I had no one to go with me.	Nnali sirina muntu agenda nange.
The food is really good.	Emmere nnungi ddala.
I have been very happy.	Mbadde musanyufu nnyo.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
But it doesn’t matter to me.	Naye si kikulu gyendi.
The problem is space.	Obuzibu buli wa bbanga.
And it can be very difficult.	Era kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
Everyone knows it.	Buli omu akimanyi.
His wife is alone.	Mukyala we ali yekka.
I will be there.	Nja kubeerawo.
I just want to do everything.	Njagala kukola buli kimu kyokka.
He didn’t want to go on alone.	Yali tayagala kugenda mu maaso yekka.
That’s what everyone said.	Ekyo buli omu kye yayogera.
But he didn't know what he was now.	Naye yali tamanyi kye yali kati.
That was what he expected.	Ekyo kye yali asuubira.
Or on anyone.	Oba ku muntu yenna.
However, it is also dangerous.	Kyokka era kya bulabe.
We have to get out of this place, and soon.	Tulina okuva mu kifo kino, era mu bbanga ttono.
That’s what we have here.	Ekyo kye tulina wano.
I think he really liked everyone in this movie.	Ndowooza ddala yali ayagala buli muntu mu firimu eno.
But, the picture was great.	Naye, ekifaananyi kyali kirungi nnyo.
Here's the thing.	Wano ekintu.
He was asleep alone.	Yali yeebase yekka.
We’re going to have to get back to that.	Tugenda kuba tulina okudda ku ekyo.
You are my friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange.
We need to move forward.	Twetaaga okugenda mu maaso.
We are the power.	Ffe tuli maanyi.
This is, of course, not true.	Kino, kya lwatu, si kituufu.
Preaching and commonplace.	Okubuulira era nga kya bulijjo.
But only now.	Naye kati kyokka.
He may have been ancient.	Ayinza okuba nga yali wa dda.
You don’t want friends.	Toyagala mikwano.
In fact, you know this all too well.	Mu butuufu kino okimanyi bulungi nnyo.
I’m pretty sure about that.	Nze nkakasa nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
Nothing comes easy.	Tewali kijja kyangu.
It’s not about you.	Si ku ggwe.
But he knew this wasn’t quite right.	Naye yali akimanyi nti kino si kituufu nnyo.
My father was too busy making money.	Taata yali bbize nnyo okukola ssente.
I point to the hospital.	Nsonga ku ddwaaliro.
And he didn’t want to.	Era yali tayagala.
She looks really happy.	Alabika ddala musanyufu.
I already know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi dda.
Of course, you do.	Kya lwatu nti ggwe okola.
But he didn’t want to do that.	Naye ekyo yali tayagala kukikola.
Or tried to .	Oba yagezaako okukola .
I feel the same way you do.	Nze mpulira nga naawe.
I was feeling pretty good, actually.	Nali mpulira bulungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
And it certainly was.	Era mazima ddala bwe kyali.
Always in the know.	Bulijjo mu kumanya.
He's the guy who's going to get the job done.	Ye ggaayi agenda okukola omulimu.
Everything and everything.	Buli kimu na buli kimu.
I’ve always lived there.	Bulijjo mbadde mbeera eyo.
I really don't know how to do this.	Mu butuufu simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukola kino.
We were the ones.	Twali ffe.
I know how difficult that is.	Nkimanyi engeri ekyo gye kizibu.
But now he had no time.	Naye kati yali talina budde.
I think it’s a good idea.	Ndowooza nti kirowoozo kirungi.
We will probably go tonight.	Oboolyawo tujja kugenda ekiro kino.
I was always me, me, me.	Bulijjo nnali nze, nze, nze.
He was reluctant to talk to police at this time.	Yali tayagala nnyo kwogera na poliisi mu kiseera kino.
He was a school teacher.	Yali musomesa wa ssomero.
You’re going to be just fine.	Ogenda kuba bulungi nnyo.
He looks dangerous.	Alabika wa bulabe.
And yet, he did it.	Era naye, yakikola.
He didn’t know it wasn’t me.	Yali tamanyi nti si nze.
I still can’t believe it.	N’okutuusa kati sisobola kukkiriza.
This is what we are going to do.	Kino kye tugenda okukola.
This will continue.	Kino kijja kugenda mu maaso.
Too many hours.	Ssaawa nnyingi nnyo.
It is on that house.	Kiri ku nnyumba eyo.
No one felt anything.	Tewali yawulira kintu kyonna.
I definitely feel like we can.	Mazima ddala mpulira nga tusobola.
You know that it is, too.	Naawe okimanyi nti bwe kiri.
He had no time for it.	Yali talina budde bwa kukikola.
This was absolutely true.	Kino kyali kituufu ddala.
This is probably true.	Kino oboolyawo kituufu.
I wanted to be happy.	Nnali njagala kubeera musanyufu.
I always hoped.	Bulijjo nnali nsuubira.
I 'm now	Nze kati .
I certainly won’t.	Mazima ddala sijja kukikola.
I can’t wait to come back.	Siyinza kulinda kudda.
I'm pretty sure he did.	Nkakasa bulungi nti yakikola.
I'm not, maybe.	Siri, mpozzi.
This is a common practice.	Eno nkola ya bulijjo.
I really like that one.	Njagala nnyo oyo.
This might work.	Kino kiyinza okukola.
None at the police station.	Tewali ku poliisi.
It’s great to work with him.	Kirungi nnyo okukola naye.
She always wanted a child.	Bulijjo yali ayagala mwana.
I can deal with that.	Nsobola okukola ku nsonga eyo.
As always, you look great.	Nga bulijjo, olabika bulungi nnyo.
That you’re okay.	Nti oli bulungi.
He loves it really.	Ayagala nnyo ddala.
It is as well as he did.	Kiri bulungi nga bwe yakola.
It’s very important to me.	Kikulu nnyo gyendi.
And that’s exactly it.	Era ekyo ddala.
Pretty good, actually.	Kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
He does everything and does it very well.	Buli kimu akikola era akikola bulungi nnyo.
Not early at all.	Si nga bukyali n’akatono.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
He would do that alone.	Ekyo yandikoze yekka.
You’re going to be fine.	Ogenda kuba bulungi.
It’s not so easy now.	Si kyangu nnyo kati.
It was very real.	Kyali kya ddala nnyo.
I’ve got a phone call.	Nze nfunye essimu.
No one did much of anything.	Tewali yakola nnyo kintu kyonna.
This is perfectly normal and not a problem.	Kino kya bulijjo ddala era si kizibu.
He can't speak.	Tasobola kwogera.
She is a dangerous woman.	Ye mukyala wa bulabe.
In obtaining the image.	Mu kufuna ekifaananyi.
As simple as that.	Nga kyangu nga ekyo.
Is that too difficult?.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo?.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
There is no reason.	Tewali nsonga yonna.
To get to that point.	Okutuuka ku ekyo.
He says he actually has too.	Agamba nti mu butuufu alina naye.
He had finished eating.	Yali amaze okulya.
He may be with her.	Ayinza okuba naye.
They probably aren’t.	Oboolyawo si bwe bali.
He said he couldn't do that.	Yagambye nti ekyo tasobola kukikola.
You really do.	Okola ddala.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
Anyone here knows this.	Omuntu yenna wano kino akimanyi.
I think he knew that.	Ndowooza ekyo yali akimanyi.
What will happen, will happen.	Ekigenda okubaawo, kijja kubaawo.
But then you don’t want anything.	Naye awo tewali ky’oyagala.
Sure, that’s easy.	Mazima ddala, ekyo kyangu.
He can probably drive.	Oboolyawo asobola okuvuga.
You are obviously not a man.	Kya lwatu nti toli musajja.
But, he has to win.	Naye, alina okuwangula.
Now we were on to something.	Kati twali ku kintu.
This seems awful.	Kino kirabika kibi nnyo.
Wish .	Singa .
Either way, it’s bad.	Mu ngeri yonna, kibi.
He knew better.	Yali amanyi bulungi.
I won’t talk.	Sijja kwogera.
I don’t want to be alone.	Saagala kubeera wekka.
He was down there.	Yali wansi awo.
Of course not, of course not.	Kya lwatu si bwe kyali, ddala si bwe kyali.
I doubt he can.	Nbuusabuusa nti asobola.
You can’t do without him.	Tosobola kukola nga tolina ye.
Everything seems so complicated.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kizibu nnyo.
This is actually very important.	Kino mu butuufu kikulu nnyo.
I couldn’t do anything at all.	Nnali sirina kye nsobola n’akatono.
. . . .	.
He said you know it too.	Yagamba nti naawe okimanyi.
He knew everything was fine now.	Yali akimanyi nti buli kimu kiri bulungi kati.
There isn’t much.	Tewali bingi.
I got to be with you.	Nfunye okubeera naawe.
He really knew it.	Ddala yali akimanyi.
And he can do it.	Era asobola okukikola.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
Everything will be enough.	Buli kimu kijja kumala.
It’s not a policy at all.	Si nkola n’akatono.
And in fact he was.	Era mu butuufu yali.
But no, no, everything is fine.	Naye nedda, nedda, buli kimu kiri bulungi.
And it’s in each of us.	Era kiri mu buli omu ku ffe.
I’ve been thinking about whatever.	Nze mbadde ndowooza ku kyonna.
This will not be a problem.	Kino tekijja kuba kizibu.
Now he will never know his father.	Kati tajja kumanya taata we.
No one is going to believe this.	Kino tewali agenda kukkiriza.
Nothing serious.	Tewali kintu kya maanyi.
I didn’t think it would work.	Nnali sirowooza nti yandikoze.
And I need help.	Era nneetaaga obuyambi.
But it’s not true.	Naye si kituufu.
He was glad he was going soon.	Yali musanyufu nti yali agenda mangu.
However, you want to do it.	Kyokka, oyagala kukikola.
He didn’t deserve this.	Kino yali tasaanidde.
It is obviously not easy.	Kya lwatu si kyangu.
They were almost in town.	Baali kumpi okutuuka mu kibuga.
And there’s this issue, here in the city.	Era waliwo ensonga eno, wano mu kibuga.
This is, of course, a serious problem.	Kino, kya lwatu, kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
This is a very bad idea.	Kino kirowoozo kibi nnyo.
But the house was safe.	Naye ennyumba yali tewali bulabe.
And it was the same everywhere.	Era buli wamu kyali kye kimu.
That was easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu.
But in many cases they are.	Naye mu mbeera nnyingi bwe bali.
That’s not an issue here.	Eyo si nsonga wano.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
He does the same thing.	Akola ekintu kye kimu.
He would rather be alone.	Yandibadde asinga kubeera yekka.
That is incorrect and incorrect.	Ekyo si kituufu era si kituufu.
That was pretty easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo.
Doing a lot of things there.	Okukola ebintu bingi eyo.
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
I am neither here nor there.	Siri wano wadde awo.
In practice, there is.	Mu nkola, waliwo.
I feel better .	Mpulira bulungi .
He was obviously trying to gain time.	Kya lwatu nti yali agezaako okufuna obudde.
He probably won’t.	Oboolyawo tajja kukikola.
Whatever it was.	Kyonna kye kyali.
Now everyone is working.	Kati buli omu akola.
In fact, he still is.	Mu butuufu, akyali bw’atyo.
I was fine with him.	Nali bulungi naye.
I’m sure it will work well.	Nkakasa nti kijja kukola bulungi.
He was alone.	Yali yekka.
You won’t be alone.	Tojja kubeera wekka.
He had no reason why.	Yali talina nsonga lwaki.
Maybe that’s true now.	Mpozzi ekyo kituufu kati.
That is why this was so important to me.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki kino kyali kikulu nnyo gyendi.
That’s actually my point.	Mu butuufu eyo y’ensonga yange.
Either way, you need to talk to him.	Mu ngeri yonna, olina okwogera naye.
But my friend did.	Naye mukwano gwange yakikola.
It’s really, really hard.	Ddala ddala kizibu.
He looked good .	Yalabika bulungi .
You do what you want.	Ggwe okola ky’oyagala.
It’s good for everyone.	Kirungi eri buli muntu.
I’m not in a hurry at all.	Siri mu bwangu n’akatono.
I think that will happen.	Ndowooza ekyo kijja kubaawo.
And we can talk.	Era tusobola okwogera.
You are a materialistic person.	Oli muntu ayagala ennyo ebintu.
You're not there, though.	Toli awo, wadde.
This was going to be a lot harder than he thought.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kizibu nnyo okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
He really should have done.	Ddala yandibadde akola.
It’s a man’s job.	Omulimu gwa musajja.
Seeing is a process.	Okulaba nkola.
They were face to face.	Baali maaso ku maaso.
This is a matter of opinion.	Eno nsonga ya ndowooza.
Every man has his own job.	Buli musajja alina omulimu gwe.
But it was hard to imagine that scenario.	Naye kyali kizibu okulowooza ku mbeera eyo.
It’s not as simple as all that.	Si kyangu nga ebyo byonna.
Nothing was good.	Tewali kyali kirungi.
I’m sick of being here.	Nze ndi mulwadde okubeera wano.
I know the date.	Nze mmanyi olunaku.
You will never have this opportunity again.	Tojja kuddamu kufuna mukisa guno.
Maybe he didn’t want to.	Mpozzi yali tayagala.
He could have been one.	Yali asobola okuba omu.
He is not nearby.	Tali kumpi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Not that he expected any trouble.	Si nti yali asuubira obuzibu bwonna.
That’s what’s important.	Ekyo kye kikulu.
This is where he had a job.	Wano we yalina omulimu.
In fact, he was very happy.	Mu butuufu, yali musanyufu nnyo.
That’s just a practical thing.	Ekyo kintu kya nkola kyokka.
And he did a pretty good job.	Era yakola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
If only he thought of me.	Singa yalowooza ku nze.
This seems to be the case.	Kino kirabika bwe kiri.
I’m thinking about him.	Nze ndowooza ku ye.
No one could do it alone.	Tewali muntu yenna yali asobola kukikola yekka.
I want to be myself.	Njagala kubeera nze kennyini.
He wanted to see if he was really strong.	Yali ayagala okulaba oba ddala yali wa maanyi.
I can think of all that.	Nsobola okulowooza ku ebyo byonna.
You know where the problem is.	Omanyi obuzibu we buli.
But he would work.	Naye yandikoze.
Or maybe .	Oba mpozzi .
You want to move on.	Oyagala kugenda mu maaso.
Not at all, he said.	Si bwe kiri, bwe yagambye.
But it would be close.	Naye kyandibadde kumpi.
He has the power.	Alina amaanyi.
No, he couldn’t do that.	Nedda, ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
He was really good.	Yali mulungi ddala.
He was obviously alone.	Kya lwatu nti yali yekka.
This is a dangerous job.	Guno mulimu gwa bulabe.
But it’ll be fine, you’ll see.	Naye kijja kuba kirungi, ojja kulaba.
Now he had one.	Kati yalina emu.
You don’t know how hard it is to go.	Tomanyi ngeri gye kizibu okugenda.
He knew he had to do something urgently.	Yali akimanyi nti alina ky’alina okukola mu bwangu.
He didn't quite know why.	Yali tamanyi bulungi lwaki.
She is so happy to be with.	Ye musanyufu nnyo okubeera naye.
Shopping is quick and easy.	Okugula ebintu kyangu era kyangu.
However, that is not the case.	Kyokka, ekyo si bwe kiri.
Now it is that .	Kati kiri nti .
That’s not my thing.	Ekyo si kye kintu kyange.
You would be there too.	Naawe wandibadde awo.
I’m not sure what they were.	Sikakasa kye baali.
It’s not true but it doesn’t really matter.	Si kituufu naye mu butuufu si kikulu.
Perhaps he was sick.	Oboolyawo yali mulwadde.
I’m here for the long haul.	Nze ndi wano okumala ebbanga.
We don’t have a situation like this here.	Tetulina mbeera nga eno wano.
It’s going to be really good.	Kigenda kuba kirungi ddala.
He wanted to, but he couldn’t.	Yali ayagala, naye nga tasobola.
It’s not a problem for me.	Si buzibu gyendi.
Gaining knowledge can help with this.	Okufuna okumanya kiyinza okuyamba ku kino.
I really have no idea.	Mazima ddala sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
You just have to work.	Olina okukola kyokka.
We have to do that.	Ekyo tulina okukikola.
You can eat well all over the city.	Osobola okulya obulungi mu kibuga kyonna.
That’s what I love.	Ekyo kye njagala ennyo.
He can’t believe it.	Tasobola kukkiriza.
It’s all he wants to do.	Kye kyokka ky’ayagala okukola.
He knew that too.	Ekyo naye yali akimanyi.
I hope someone can help.	Nsuubira nti waliwo asobola okuyamba.
I don’t care about this.	Nze sifaayo ku nsonga eno.
I am alone here.	Nze wano ndi nzekka.
You are beautiful in your own way.	Oli mulungi mu ngeri yo.
It’s easy to do.	Kyangu okukola.
This is what really matters.	Kino kye kikulu ennyo.
But he wasn’t human, and it wasn’t easy.	Naye yali si muntu, era nga si kyangu.
I just wanted to go home.	Nnali njagala kudda waka kyokka.
We can and must respond.	Tusobola era tulina okuddamu.
They were lucky, you might say.	Baali ba mukisa, oyinza okugamba.
Maybe he's on here.	Mpozzi ali ku wano.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
You should see my plan.	Olina okulaba enteekateeka yange.
I am absolutely sure.	Nze nkakasa ddala.
This is what he did.	Kino kye yakola.
Everything was fine.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi.
In the hospital.	Mu ddwaaliro.
In fact, it is.	Mu butuufu bwe kiri.
I have to move on.	Nnina okugenda mu maaso.
It’s not very common.	Si kya bulijjo nnyo.
And it was happening now.	Era kyali kigenda mu maaso kati.
And of course we will eat with you.	Era ddala tujja kulya naawe.
He seems to be coping well with the situation.	Alabika akola bulungi ku mbeera eno.
I don’t want to be that guy.	Saagala kubeera ggaayi oyo.
He was fast, eager, friendly.	Yali wa bwangu, nga ayagala nnyo, nga wa mukwano.
We just have to play hard.	Tulina kumala kuzannya nnyo.
No one thought it would happen.	Tewali yali alowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
This is a matter of urgency.	Eno nsonga ya bwangu.
But you’re the only one.	Naye ggwe wekka.
He had something to do.	Yalina kye yakola.
She was a beautiful young woman, and very young.	Yali mukyala muto omulungi, era nga muto nnyo.
But he had to be ready.	Naye yalina okuba nga mwetegefu.
He is a school teacher.	Musomesa wa ssomero.
Going to do that tomorrow.	Okugenda okukola ekyo enkya.
I loved that picture.	Ekifaananyi ekyo nnali njagala nnyo.
And my brother.	Ne muganda wange.
Not that he wanted to.	Si nti yali ayagala.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
I can’t tell.	Siyinza kumanya.
He was in a hurry.	Yali mu bwangu nnyo.
I should have gone home.	Nnali nsaanidde okudda eka.
I wish they were together.	Njagala nnyo nga bali bombi.
I was sick all the time.	Nnali mulwadde buli kiseera.
He couldn’t stay there.	Yali tasobola kusigala awo.
This to me is not faith.	Kino gyendi si kukkiriza.
That’s pretty easy to do.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo okukola.
I’ve had plenty of time to think about it.	Nfunye obudde bungi okulowooza ku nsonga eno.
. . . .	.
He has one brother.	Alina muganda we omu.
He loves to work.	Ayagala nnyo okukola.
Working is not working.	Okukola si kukola.
And it was a sin.	Era kyali kibi.
You really can’t know.	Mazima ddala tosobola kumanya.
I thought maybe we could all eat together.	Nalowooza nti osanga ffenna tusobola okulya ffenna.
This goes for anyone.	Kino kigenda ku muntu yenna.
I don’t think it would be good, not soon enough.	Sirowooza nti kyandibadde kirungi, si mangu.
Nothing will be easier than that.	Tewali kijja kuba kyangu okusinga ekyo.
He should have.	Yandibadde alina.
I need to step back.	Nze nneetaaga okudda emabega.
And movie time.	Era obudde bwa firimu.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
You were always happy and friendly.	Bulijjo wali musanyufu era nga wa mukwano.
This problem is certainly a serious one.	Mazima ddala ekizibu kino kikulu nnyo.
It was very close, of course.	Kyali kumpi nnyo, ddala.
He had been afraid.	Yali abadde atya.
Nothing is ordinary or normal.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo oba kya bulijjo.
The phone is in the room.	Essimu eri mu kisenge.
You were always working.	Bulijjo wali okola.
Someone else would have to do it.	Omuntu omulala yandibadde alina okukikola.
From the point of view.	Okuva mu ndowooza.
We all have it.	Ffenna tulina.
Or in the hour.	Oba mu ssaawa.
My plan will work.	Enteekateeka yange ejja kukola.
He was a poet and musician .	Yali muyimbi era muyimbi .
Everything will be fine now.	Buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi kati.
Now that.	Kati nga...
All but one.	Byonna okuggyako omu.
He was afraid at the time.	Yali atya mu kiseera ekyo.
We have it right.	Tulina bulungi.
This book was a labor of love for me.	Ekitabo kino kyali mulimu gwa kwagala gyendi.
It’s not too complicated at all.	Si kizibu nnyo n’akatono.
It doesn’t get much easier than that.	Si kyangu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I don’t know everything about anything.	Simanyi buli kimu ku kintu kyonna.
He readily agreed.	Yakkiriza mangu.
I am now very sick.	Nze kati ndi mulwadde nnyo.
I don’t want to know anything about it.	Saagala kumanya kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
Very much so, actually.	Nnyo nnyo, mu butuufu.
But this is not quite true.	Naye kino si kituufu nnyo.
There is just something about this car.	Waliwo ekintu kyokka ku mmotoka eno.
I don’t like it in him.	Sikyagala mu ye.
I didn’t have a car.	Nze nali sirina mmotoka.
Someone is speaking.	Waliwo ayogera.
And most of all to yourself.	Era okusinga byonna eri ggwe kennyini.
He was stronger than ever.	Yali wa maanyi okusinga bwe yali.
You can’t get anything now.	Tosobola kufuna kintu kyonna kati.
You know very well that he has .	Omanyi bulungi nti alina .
But we need everyone to address this.	Naye kino twetaaga buli muntu okukola ku nsonga eno.
I always wonder why.	Bulijjo nneebuuza lwaki.
I will definitely eat.	Nja kulya ddala.
And he was alone.	Era yali yekka.
I have nothing to do with it.	Sirina kye nnyinza kukikola.
You will be vulnerable with him, or not.	Ojja kuba mu bulabe naye, oba nedda.
No one is saying otherwise.	Tewali agamba nti si bwe kiri.
He was very fond of money.	Yali ayagala nnyo ssente.
He knew we would come to help.	Yali akimanyi nti tujja kujja okuyamba.
I think it was over the weekend.	Ndowooza kyali ku wiikendi.
It's downstairs.	Kiri wansi.
He looked so normal.	Yali alabika nga wa bulijjo nnyo.
I’m not going anywhere.	Sirina gye ngenda.
Both are powerful.	Bombi ba maanyi.
You are, and should be for a long time.	Oli, era olina okumala ebbanga ddene.
And as a father.	Era nga taata.
He loved my father.	Yali ayagala nnyo taata wange.
And it’s very easy to do.	Era kyangu nnyo okukola.
Anyone can do this though.	Kino omuntu yenna asobola okukikola wadde.
I'll see.	Nja kulaba.
But it was true for us.	Naye nga kituufu gye tuli.
We're hoping someone will come forward.	Tulina essuubi nti waliwo ajja kujja mu maaso.
It’s great to be back here.	Kirungi nnyo okudda wano.
But it’s nothing really serious.	Naye si kintu kya maanyi ddala.
Everyone should have this.	Buli muntu alina okubeera ne kino.
He would have to be.	Yandibadde alina okuba.
This is not a policy.	Eno si nkola.
Really .	Kituufu .
My friend was very young.	Mukwano gwange yali muto nnyo.
Maybe that was us.	Mpozzi ekyo kye twali ffe.
Everyone had something to say about him.	Buli omu yalina ky’ayagala okwogera ku ye.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
He says it's mine.	Agamba nti kyange.
I don’t really like that.	Ekyo sikyagala nnyo.
You have plenty of time.	Olina obudde bungi.
If only he knew.	Singa yali amanyi kyokka.
Now he is strong.	Kati wa maanyi.
He couldn’t go home.	Yali tasobola kudda waka.
I guess he’ll just stay home.	Ntebereza nti ajja kumala kusigala waka.
But we were helpless.	Naye twali tetulina kye tusobola kukola.
You are going to love this movie.	Ogenda kwagala nnyo firimu eno.
Everyone was very friendly.	Buli omu yali wa mukwano nnyo.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo.
I'll go again.	Nja kuddamu okugenda.
This is simply not true.	Kino si kituufu kyokka.
Maybe you can get help too.	Mpozzi naawe oyinza okufuna obuyambi.
Someone works to earn money.	Omuntu akola okufuna ssente.
I’ve just got something.	Nze nfunye ekintu kyokka.
Maybe he should have.	Mpozzi yandibadde.
Soon he was gone.	Mu bbanga ttono yagenda.
And he did well.	Era yakola bulungi.
You have to go tonight.	Olina okugenda ekiro kino.
A book, perhaps.	Ekitabo, mpozzi.
You basically have to do it yourself.	Okusinga olina okukikola ggwe kennyini.
Everyone knew who he was.	Buli omu yali amanyi ani.
That's my son.	Oyo mwana wange.
And the job.	Era omulimu.
This was going to be easy.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kyangu.
He calls to say so.	Akuba essimu okwogera bw’atyo.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
So far it looks great.	N'okutuusa kati kirabika bulungi nnyo.
I had nothing.	Nnali sirina kintu kyonna.
He will be.	Ajja kuba.
Not everyone can do this job.	Si buli muntu nti asobola okukola omulimu guno.
I knew what was going to happen there.	Nnali mmanyi ekigenda okubaawo eyo.
That would be a problem.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
Always behind him.	Bulijjo emabega we.
I can do this.	Kino nsobola okukikola.
But this is not all.	Naye bino si byonna.
Everyone is working.	Buli omu akola.
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kirungi.
And it still is.	Era n’okutuusa kati bwe kiri.
I said no problem.	Nagamba nti tewali buzibu.
That’s his father.	Oyo ye taata we.
And they are my friend.	Era bali mukwano gwange.
We are that.	Ffe tuli ekyo.
You don’t know the guy.	Tomanyi ggaayi.
And it seems to be everywhere.	Era kirabika buli wamu.
However, he did not think that would happen.	Kyokka yali talowooza nti ekyo kijja kubaawo.
It will not work .	Tekijja kukola .
The guy thought he knew everything.	Ggaayi yalowooza nti buli kimu akimanyi.
You can do it again.	Osobola okuddamu okukikola.
That there is hope.	Nti waliwo essuubi.
I'll see to that.	Nja kulaba ekyo.
But it’s actually much worse than that.	Naye mu butuufu kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
But he probably can’t.	Naye osanga tasobola.
And we .	Era ffe .
The problem is everything is what.	Obuzibu buli ki kye ki.
No one wanted to.	Tewali yali ayagala.
Who are you? 	Ggwe ani?
But someone has to do it.	Naye waliwo alina okukola.
He will definitely know it wasn’t.	Ajja kumanya ddala nti si bwe kyali.
But this is not quite true.	Naye kino si kituufu nnyo.
You probably will.	Oboolyawo ojja kukikola.
Nothing for them.	Tewali kintu kyonna gye bali.
He is going to go home.	Agenda okudda eka.
It’s his thing.	Kintu kye.
One went downstairs.	Omu yagenda wansi.
But he may be safe.	Naye ayinza okuba nga talina bulabe.
A job for them.	Omulimu gye bali.
I don’t want to buy now.	Saagala kugula kati.
You can do everything right.	Buli kimu osobola okukola obulungi.
We certainly have.	Mazima ddala tulina.
You’re not happy.	Toli musanyufu.
Nothing was together.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyali wamu.
And he knew what he had to do, too.	Era naye yali amanyi ky’alina okukola.
I hope you don’t know.	Nsuubira nti tomanyi.
I have to know.	Nnina okumanya.
He didn’t want to see.	Yali tayagala kulaba.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
No one could speak.	Tewali yali asobola kwogera.
Maybe that’s what he is.	Mpozzi ekyo ky’ali.
There is no one there.	Tewali muntu yenna awo.
For the longest time.	Okumala okusinga ebbanga ddene.
This is not a close issue.	Eno si nsonga eri kumpi.
And you are so beautiful.	Era oli mulungi nnyo.
No one wants to be here.	Tewali ayagala kubeera wano.
But the other, he just didn’t want to.	Naye omulala, yali tayagala kyokka.
I don’t care.	Nze sifaayo.
Quickly, he thought.	Mu bwangu, bwe yalowooza.
He always had.	Bulijjo yalina.
He was a patient, he was a doctor.	Yali mulwadde, yali musawo.
Everything is absolutely true.	Buli kimu kituufu ddala.
He has a problem in my opinion.	Alina ekizibu mu ndowooza yange.
We are lucky.	Tuli ba mukisa.
He is a poet.	Ye muyimbi.
Perhaps that was what he needed.	Oboolyawo ekyo kye yali yeetaaga.
He felt comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi.
But he has a hard time talking.	Naye alina ekizibu okwogera.
That’s not a thing.	Ekyo si kintu.
But it is not common.	Naye si kya bulijjo.
That’s what we are.	Ekyo kye tuli.
I work very, very hard.	Nkola nnyo nnyo.
He's just a kid.	Ye mwana muto yekka.
I know that .	Nkimanyi nti .
He could not believe this.	Kino yali tasobola kukkiriza.
I will try the matter with my brother.	Nja kugezaako ensonga ne muganda wange.
I want one too.	Nange njagala emu.
I have to stay for a very long time.	Nnina okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
There was a reason he shouldn’t have done that.	Waliwo ensonga lwaki yali tasaanidde kukola ekyo.
He needed help.	Yali yeetaaga obuyambi.
And that won’t work.	Era ekyo tekijja kukola.
Soon, he got what he wanted.	Mu bbanga ttono, yafuna kye yali ayagala.
He actually has a personality.	Mu butuufu alina omuntu.
There is nothing to say.	Tewali kya kwogera.
He is my son.	Ye mwana wange.
We were supposed to, but no one actually did.	Twali tulina okukikola, naye mu butuufu tewali yakikola.
We were going to.	Twali tugenda.
Of course, you know that he is not very strong.	Kya lwatu, okimanyi nti si wa maanyi nnyo.
But he still wasn’t ready to go home.	Naye nga n’okutuusa kati yali si mwetegefu kudda waka.
But he didn't know what.	Naye yali tamanyi kiki.
This dog	Embwa eno .
But it was going to be good.	Naye kyali kigenda kuba kirungi.
My father had this view.	Taata yalina endowooza eno.
He is ready to work.	Mwetegefu okukola.
It just looks good .	Kirabika bulungi kyokka .
I don’t know if he will.	Simanyi oba ajja kukikola.
Not exactly bad, but not very good either.	Si kibi ddala, naye era si kirungi nnyo.
They are not that way at all.	Si ba ngeri eyo n’akatono.
You are my best friend.	Oli mukwano gwange nnyo.
He had to do it.	Yali alina okukikola.
Who was he? 	Yali ani?
And yes, that’s true.	Era ye, ekyo kituufu.
It is indeed very soon.	Mazima ddala mangu nnyo.
He is strong despite his youth.	Wa maanyi wadde nga yali muto.
That’s very realistic.	Ekyo kya ddala nnyo.
Now is the time for me to say .	Kati kye kiseera nze okugamba nti .
The food is excellent.	Emmere nnungi nnyo.
No one needed it.	Tewali yali yeetaaga.
I’m just a man.	Nze ndi musajja yekka.
I guess you know.	Ntebereza nti omanyi.
But no one can really live this way.	Naye mu butuufu tewali asobola kubeera mu ngeri eno.
Not for food, though.	Kyokka si lwa kulya.
I just wanted to.	Nze nnali njagala kyokka.
But this is definitely not the case.	Naye kino ddala si bwe kiri.
Excuse me for dinner.	Nsonyiwa ekyeggulo.
That’s not the point.	Eyo si y’ensonga.
But I feel it.	Naye mpulira.
But this is not entirely true.	Naye kino si kituufu ddala.
And for me.	Era ku nze.
He certainly didn’t want to go.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala kugenda.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
It would be so dangerous!.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe nnyo!.
How can I go about this.	Nnyinza ntya okugenda ku nsonga eno.
It’s none of my business.	Si nsonga yange yonna.
I think he would be good if he tried.	Ndowooza yandibadde omulungi singa agezaako.
Why would anyone do that?.	Lwaki omuntu yenna yandikoze ekyo?.
I have nothing good to say about that.	Ekyo sirina kirungi kye nnyinza kwogera.
I’m still not sure.	Nze n’okutuusa kati sikakasa.
However, I cannot say anything about it.	Kyokka siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
Or until now.	Oba okutuuka kati.
The same thing anyway.	Ekintu kye kimu mu ngeri yonna.
Not wanting at that.	Nga tayagala ku ekyo.
This is a beautiful city.	Kino kibuga kirungi nnyo.
That was normal.	Ekyo kyali kya bulijjo.
I’m here for a reason.	Nze ndi wano lwa nsonga.
I couldn’t come.	Nnali sisobola kujja.
I don’t want to talk about it again.	Saagala kuddamu kwogera ku nsonga eno.
He said he was busy.	Yagambye nti yali bbize.
He will love everyone.	Ajja kwagala buli muntu.
No, it’s not him.	Nedda, si ye.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
No really, it is.	Nedda ddala, bwe kiri.
He had plenty of time.	Yalina obudde bungi.
He probably should have.	Oboolyawo yandibadde alina.
I don’t want any money.	Saagala ssente yonna.
This was always a difficult thing for me.	Kino bulijjo kyali kintu kizibu gyendi.
And this was sudden.	Era kino kyali kya mangu.
This is very powerful.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo.
Actually this was not the case.	Mu butuufu kino si bwe kyali.
I'm aware of it.	Nze nkimanyi.
So far the attitude.	N’okutuusa kati endowooza.
He will make arrangements.	Ajja kukola enteekateeka.
That’s what we are.	Ekyo kye tuli.
He was nobody.	Yali si muntu yenna.
I don’t want to do that.	Ekyo saagala kukikola.
There is nothing for me here.	Tewali kintu kyonna gyendi wano.
This is everything to us.	Kino kye kintu kyonna gye tuli.
It’s not his job to know.	Si mulimu gwe okumanya.
That it can happen quickly.	Nti kiyinza okubaawo mu bwangu.
And maybe he was one, at that.	Era mpozzi yali omu, ku ekyo.
You can go home.	Osobola okudda eka.
You are not in a good mood.	Toli mu mbeera nnungi.
His wife too.	Mukyala we naye.
It was my time to go.	Kyali kiseera kyange okugenda.
He's not dangerous or anything.	Si wa bulabe oba ekintu kyonna.
We just needed one more person.	Twali twetaaga omuntu omulala omu yekka.
I thought this would be good.	Nalowooza nti kino kyandibadde kirungi.
He has the money.	Alina ssente.
He watched the movie.	Yalaba firimu.
I guess it’s not.	Ntebereza nti si bwe kiri.
You are certainly the reason why.	Mazima ddala ggwe ensonga lwaki.
But that was the plan.	Naye eyo ye yali enteekateeka.
Maybe that's the point.	Oboolyawo eyo y'ensonga.
It may or may not be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri oba nedda.
No! 	Nedda!
not like him.	si nga ye.
I’m fine now.	Nze kati ndi bulungi.
But more than that .	Naye okusinga ekyo .
He probably couldn’t.	Oboolyawo yali tasobola.
I will do this immediately.	Kino nja kukikola amangu ddala.
He was talking to me.	Yali ayogera nange.
That is why we are all here now.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki ffenna tuli wano kati.
I'm going to come.	Ngenda kujja.
That's all there is so far.	Ekyo kyokka kye kiri okutuusa kati.
And this is my problem now.	Era kino kye kizibu kyange kati.
He can be really good.	Asobola okuba omulungi ddala.
I want a friend with you.	Njagala mukwano naawe.
You don’t want to talk about money, it’s fine.	Toyagala kwogera ku ssente, kirungi.
We will do it.	Tujja kukikola.
All right, now that’s a problem.	Kirungi, kati ekyo kizibu.
And you won’t be able to either.	Era naawe tojja kusobola.
Though not today.	Wadde nga si leero.
Or all the time.	Oba buli kiseera.
That’s what we’re there for.	Ekyo kye tuli eyo.
You have to do this.	Kino olina okukikola.
However, three reasons.	Kyokka ensonga ssatu.
In fact, it isn’t.	Mu butuufu, si bwe kiri.
Planning is important.	Enteekateeka kikulu.
I needed the police.	Nnali nneetaaga poliisi.
I know you won’t.	Nkimanyi nti tojja kukikola.
He had one.	Yalina emu.
But the point of it all is this.	Naye ensonga ya byonna eri eno.
This is not a common view.	Eno si ndowooza ya bulijjo.
He’s not really a person.	Mu butuufu si muntu.
I can’t wait though.	Siyinza kulinda wadde.
I had no idea how true this was.	Kino nnali simanyi ngeri kituufu gye kyali.
I can’t today.	Sisobola leero.
He didn’t have a house.	Yali talina nnyumba.
He will do well here.	Ajja kukola bulungi wano.
But not so with everyone.	Naye si bwatyo ne buli muntu.
For everything, it seems.	Ku buli kimu, kirabika.
I need a moment to think.	Nneetaaga akaseera okulowooza.
And he tried.	Era yagezaako.
This is important to us.	Kino kikulu gye tuli.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
That’s all it really is.	Ekyo kyokka kye kiri mu butuufu.
Everyone at work.	Buli muntu ku mulimu.
We have everybody.	Tulina buli muntu.
Maybe, just maybe.	Mpozzi, mpozzi kyokka.
He had not commented on this.	Yali tannaba kwogera ku nsonga eno.
He knows where this thing is.	Amanyi ekintu kino gye kiri.
This was really quite simple.	Kino ddala kyali kyangu nnyo.
The plan is complete.	Enteekateeka ewedde.
He was lucky.	Yalina omukisa.
He won’t, of course.	Tajja kukikola, ddala.
You certainly can’t.	Mazima ddala tosobola.
She wasn’t like that, she thought.	Si bw’atyo bwe yali, bwe yalowooza.
You and I as one.	Nze naawe nga omu.
I'm not sure what that mattered.	Sikakasa nti ekyo kyali kikulu ki.
This was something I didn’t know.	Kino kyali kintu kye nnali simanyi.
I couldn’t do without it.	Nnali sisobola kukola nga tewali.
I knew nothing of all this.	Bino byonna nnali sirina kye mmanyi.
It’s not a problem at all.	Si kizibu n’akatono.
I will do that.	Ekyo nja kukikola.
In this case, he is much better.	Mu mbeera eno, asinga nnyo.
We have another one.	Tulina omulala.
Now, it was pretty cool.	Kati, kyali kirungi nnyo.
And it’s not money.	Era si ssente.
She wanted him to say no, he knew it.	Yali ayagala agamba nti nedda, yali akimanyi.
He had no idea now.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna kati.
That had to be it, he thought.	Ekyo kyalina okuba nga bwe kiri, bwe yalowooza.
At the time you want.	Ku kiseera ky’oyagala.
It's a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi.
I won’t even speak.	Sijja na kwogera.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
It just matters that it’s a good idea.	Kikulu kyokka nti kirowoozo kirungi.
I doubt he was alone.	Nbuusabuusa nti yali yekka.
I know we can do it, that’s not the problem.	Nkimanyi nti tusobola okukikola, ekyo si kye kizibu.
We will do the same.	Naffe tujja kukola kye kimu.
Now, he is asleep.	Kati, yeebase.
Obviously, they are not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe bali.
I can do it now.	Nsobola kati.
That was really important.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo ddala.
You are going to love this.	Kino ogenda kwagala nnyo.
He didn’t have any strong opinions, either.	Yali talina ndowooza yonna ya maanyi, era.
Really easy to talk to.	Ddala kyangu okwogera naye.
No one spoke to me.	Tewali yayogera nange.
Not on time.	Si ku budde.
The phone started ringing.	Essimu yatandika okukuba.
Maybe not for you.	Mpozzi si gy’oli.
Not too bad, actually.	Si kibi nnyo, mu butuufu.
I wish we had.	Njagala nnyo nga tulina.
I know there is a reason behind all of this.	Nkimanyi nti waliwo ensonga eri emabega wa bino byonna.
If anyone can help that would be great.	Singa waliwo asobola okuyamba ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
That was who he wanted to be.	Oyo ye yali ayagala okubeera.
I know it well enough.	Nze nkimanyi bulungi.
He couldn't answer.	Yali tasobola kuddamu.
And it certainly is.	Era mazima ddala bwe kiri.
I would love to do this with you.	Njagala nnyo okukola kino naawe.
But it was good.	Naye kyali kirungi.
This is, more than likely, quite true.	Kino, okusinga okusinga, kituufu nnyo.
He knows that very well.	Ekyo akimanyi nnyo.
He had to be here.	Yalina okuba wano.
I thought you were my friend.	Nnalowooza nti oli mukwano gwange.
We all have time.	Ffenna tulina obudde.
It wasn’t what he expected or hoped for.	Si kye yali asuubira oba kye yali asuubira.
I thought she was really good.	Nalowooza nti ddala yali mulungi.
It will be a little more difficult on the weekend.	Kijja kuba kizibu katono ku wiikendi.
You are important to us.	Ggwe kikulu gye tuli.
I wasn’t so sure myself.	Nze kennyini nnali sikakasa nnyo.
Like at school.	Nga ku ssomero.
Now, nothing is happening.	Kati, tewali kigenda mu maaso.
This is important to know.	Kino kikulu okumanya.
But he would have to go.	Naye yandibadde alina okugenda.
But that’s nothing.	Naye ekyo si kintu kyonna.
In that way.	Mu ngeri eyo.
I'm not sure how.	Sikakasa ngeri ki.
I thought everyone had it.	Nalowooza nti buli muntu alina.
Where we are.	Ffe we ​​tuli.
But that’s not what it is.	Naye ekyo si kye kiri.
He would have to go home.	Yandibadde alina okudda eka.
He just wanted to see one thing he knew.	Yali ayagala kulaba kintu kimu kyokka kye yali amanyi.
Knowledge is not power.	Okumanya si maanyi.
It was really him .	Ddala yali ye .
Maybe no one’s way is my way.	Mpozzi tewali ngeri ya muntu yenna ngeri yange.
I could think about it.	Nnali nsobola okulowooza ku nsonga eyo.
I wonder who, though.	Kyokka nneebuuza ani.
And he can.	Era asobola.
Now you are mine.	Kati ggwe oli wange.
But you knew that.	Naye ekyo wali okimanyi.
I love this stuff.	Njagala nnyo ebintu bino.
It’s the same for everyone.	Kye kimu eri buli muntu.
And that was my point.	Era ekyo kye kyali ensonga yange.
Not really, but it would be.	Si ddala, naye kyandibadde.
This is a powerful one.	Kino kya maanyi.
And it’s not for the money.	Era si lwa ssente.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
This is just one thing.	Kino kintu kimu kyokka.
And he was trying to move on.	Era yali agezaako okugenda mu maaso.
My wife wants a child.	Mukyala wange ayagala mwana.
However, that is not the case at all.	Kyokka, ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
He didn’t want to go to any city.	Yali tayagala kugenda mu kibuga kyonna.
What are you	Ggwe oli ki .
I hope you like it .	Nsuubira nti oyagala nnyo .
It’s actually hard work.	Mu butuufu mulimu gwa maanyi.
You can’t come here.	Tosobola kujja wano.
I thought it would be a way.	Nalowooza nti yandibadde ngeri.
I was that person.	Nze nali muntu oyo.
Not very lucky for them.	Si kya mukisa nnyo gye bali.
He may well have.	Ayinza bulungi okuba nga yalina.
This is certainly true.	Kino mazima ddala kituufu.
Maybe you already knew this.	Mpozzi kino wali okimanyi dda.
My wife went away.	Mukyala wange yagenda.
Everyone in the room did.	Buli muntu mu kisenge yakikola.
And it’s not the same thing.	Era si kintu kye kimu.
Every city is.	Buli kibuga kiri.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I'm sorry you're here with me.	Nsonyiwa oli wano nange.
But he just couldn’t do it.	Naye yali tasobola kukikola kyokka.
This, of course, he could not do.	Kino, kya lwatu, yali tasobola kukikola.
That it was so beautiful.	Nti kyali kirungi nnyo.
I have to work .	Nnina okukola .
He would have been there.	Yandibadde awo.
He didn’t want her to do that.	Yali tayagala akole ekyo.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
We’re going together.	Tugenda ffembi.
That's what he is.	Kye ky'ali.
It was a huge amount of money.	Kyali kya ssente nnyingi nnyo.
But yes, he will try.	Naye ye, ajja kugezaako.
As if nothing really mattered much.	Nga bwe kiri nti ddala tewali kintu kyonna kyali kikulu nnyo.
This seems very difficult to do.	Kino kirabika kizibu nnyo okukola.
They were almost there.	Baali kumpi okutuuka awo.
Anyone was the problem.	Omuntu yenna ye yali ekizibu.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
He is still too young for me.	Akyali muto nnyo gyendi.
For him, planning is everything.	Ku ye, enteekateeka kye buli kimu.
He thinks he has.	Alowooza nti alina.
Perhaps that is true.	Oboolyawo ekyo kituufu.
I'm not sure if this is a very good idea.	Sikakasa oba kino kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
And of course, it will happen.	Era ddala, kijja kubaawo.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
He does his job.	Akola omulimu gwe.
It was a serious problem.	Kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
But the point is not that he will eat.	Naye ensonga si nti ajja kulya.
It won’t be bad.	Tekijja kuba kibi.
I don’t want anything from you.	Saagala kintu kyonna okuva gy’oli.
It doesn’t matter if it’s true or not.	Si kikulu oba kituufu oba nedda.
He is not very good.	Si mulungi nnyo.
I love my current job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwe nkola kati.
I love to read.	Njagala nnyo okusoma.
He doesn’t want anything.	Talina ky’ayagala.
He can’t, he won’t.	Tasobola, tajja kukikola.
You can do the same thing.	Naawe oyinza okukola ekintu kye kimu.
He was still beautiful.	Yali akyali mulungi.
Which he had to do.	Kye yalina okukola.
I don’t want to eat anything.	Saagala kulya kintu kyonna.
These things you need to know.	Ebintu bino olina okumanya.
Things my wife didn’t like.	Ebintu mukyala wange bye yali tayagala.
However, it is very important.	Kyokka, kikulu nnyo.
That was probably pretty cool.	Ekyo oboolyawo kyali kirungi nnyo.
But, you are human too.	Naye, naawe oli muntu.
He said he didn’t have any.	Yagambye nti talina.
You never know what’s going to happen.	Tomanyi kigenda kubaawo.
He was always such a scared kid.	Bulijjo yali mwana atya bw’atyo.
Not good at all, actually.	Si kirungi n’akatono, mu butuufu.
No, not even that.	Nedda, si wadde ekyo.
It would just be the only one.	Kyandibadde kyokka kyokka.
However, that is very simple.	Kyokka, ekyo kyangu nnyo.
You know, but he's young.	Omanyi naye nga muto.
Every thought is plain to see, but not now.	Buli kirowoozo kya lwatu okulaba, naye si kati.
You can go to jail.	Osobola okugenda mu kkomera.
However, in the distance you can see anything.	Kyokka mu bbanga osobola okulaba ekintu kyonna.
What was this, he thought.	Kino kyali ki, bwe yalowooza.
But it is the city.	Naye kye kibuga.
I was very lonely.	Nali nzekka nnyo.
There was nothing he could do.	Tewali kintu kyonna kye yali asobola kukola.
He has no idea what it is.	Talina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki.
That seems to be the case though.	Ekyo kirabika bwe kiri wadde.
It is us more than we are.	Ye ffe okusinga bwe tuli.
You’re young.	Oli muto.
It will be worse than that.	Kijja kuba kibi okusinga ekyo.
It could have been easier than that.	Kyandibadde kyangu okusinga ekyo.
He is the power.	Ye maanyi.
But it won’t happen.	Naye tekijja kubaawo.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
Maybe he can.	Mpozzi asobola.
I had to be without my own.	Nnali nnina okuba nga sirina kyange.
This is definitely not for everyone.	Kino mazima ddala si kya buli muntu.
He wants to know everything.	Ayagala okumanya buli kimu.
You’re getting away from someone.	Oba ogenda okuva ku muntu.
He really thinks so.	Ddala alowooza bw’atyo.
And he probably would be in this situation.	Era osanga yandibadde mu mbeera eno.
They are just like us.	Bali nga ffe bwe tuli.
I don’t want it here.	Saagala wano.
He doesn't think he's very good, though.	Kyokka talowooza nti mulungi nnyo.
It was an ambitious plan.	Yali nteekateeka ya maanyi nnyo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
And there is no right place.	Era tewali kifo kituufu.
I feel good right now.	Mpulira bulungi mu kiseera kino.
You're going to be.	Ogenda kuba.
He didn’t need to know.	Yali teyeetaaga kumanya.
But this was fine.	Naye kino kyali kirungi.
I feel lucky.	Nze mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa.
He wants to make movies.	Ayagala kukola firimu.
However, he is very sick.	Kyokka ye mulwadde nnyo.
It was actually a beautiful place.	Mu butuufu kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
In the open.	Mu lwatu.
Everything I do.	Byonna bye nkola.
It would have been easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu.
And not before.	Era si emabegako.
He could hardly do it.	Yali tasobola bulungi kukikola.
This was a patient.	Kino yali mulwadde.
This was a serious problem.	Kino kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
Not bad.	Si kibi.
This is very unusual.	Kino si kya bulijjo nnyo.
But he was real.	Naye yali wa ddala.
No doctor did it.	Tewali musawo yenna yakikola.
He didn’t want to go on.	Yali tayagala kugenda mu maaso.
And he was very sick.	Era yali mulwadde nnyo.
A little, anyway.	Katono, mu ngeri yonna.
But, it is what it is.	Naye, kye kiri.
Not even his girlfriend.	Si wadde muganzi we.
That’s fine, in theory.	Ekyo kirungi, mu ndowooza.
You are in no position to be around him.	Toli mu mbeera yonna ya kubeera kumpi naye.
In fact it wasn’t.	Mu butuufu si bwe kyali.
He was good to me in so many ways.	Yali mulungi gyendi mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo.
That is my position.	Ekyo kye kifo kyange.
Even if he wanted to.	Ne bwe yali ayagala.
You know that you are.	Omanyi nti oli.
Not a real person.	Si muntu ddala.
Maybe this weekend.	Mpozzi wiikendi eno.
That’s what he wasn’t going to do.	Ekyo kye yali tagenda kukikola.
I wonder what it is.	Nze nneebuuza kye kiri.
He couldn't say anything.	Yali tasobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
Everyone had something for everyone else.	Buli muntu yalina ky’alina ku buli muntu omulala.
His wife went alone.	Mukyala we yagenda yekka.
A moment, he thought.	Akaseera katono, bwe yalowooza.
But he was happy with us.	Naye yali musanyufu naffe.
He wouldn’t have known.	Yandibadde tamanyi.
Or good, of course.	Oba kirungi, ddala.
I want the reason.	Njagala ensonga.
Behind you go.	Emabega ggwe ogenda.
I was pretty good at my job.	Nnali mulungi nnyo mu mulimu gwange.
This can be a problem.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
My job is the job.	Omulimu gwange gwe mulimu.
It really seems.	Kirabika ddala.
He didn’t even want to talk about the wedding.	Yali tayagala na kwogera ku mbaga eno.
I have nothing here.	Wano sirina kintu kyonna.
I think everyone knows that.	Ndowooza ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
He knows what he wants.	Amanyi ky’ayagala.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
We have to think.	Tulina okulowooza.
Not exactly a bad idea.	Si kirowoozo kibi ddala.
You know, always praying.	Omanyi, bulijjo nga nsaba.
I'm going to try.	Ngenda kugezaako.
And we belong together, you and I.	Era tuli ba wamu, nze naawe.
You have to go now.	Olina okugenda kati.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
Always, nothing.	Bulijjo, tewali kintu kyonna.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
On that it went on.	Ku ekyo ne kigenda mu maaso.
But it will work.	Naye kijja kukola.
Maybe at the time it is.	Mpozzi mu kiseera ekyo bwe kiri.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
That may be true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
Someone has to be.	Omuntu alina okuba.
He'll stay, though, all right.	Ajja kusigala, naye, bulungi.
I can’t function normally.	Sisobola kukola mu ngeri ya bulijjo.
Nothing could be more difficult.	Tewali kiyinza kuba kizibu okusinga ekyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
He was very down to earth and real.	Yali wansi nnyo era nga wa ddala.
That may have been my problem.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
But you are doing very well.	Naye okola bulungi nnyo.
He was speaking quickly.	Yali ayogera mangu.
Not necessarily that you should go.	Si kituufu nti wandibadde ogenda.
But he knew better.	Naye yali asinga okumanya.
We have to do that again.	Ekyo tulina okuddamu okukikola.
He knows that for a reason.	Ekyo akimanyi lwa nsonga.
He obviously didn’t have one.	Kya lwatu nti yali talina.
There is no answer to these.	Tewali kuddamu kubaawo ku bino.
That’s pretty much the same thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo ekintu kye kimu.
But he came with me.	Naye yajja nange.
Apparently he had.	Kirabika yalina...
In fact, it’s good for them.	Mu butuufu, kirungi gye bali.
But tonight, no one.	Naye ekiro kino, tewali muntu yenna.
I feel alone.	Mpulira nga ndi nzekka.
This is the only truth.	Kino kyokka kye kituufu.
I should be aware of that.	Ekyo nnina okuba nga nkimanyi.
And it will happen.	Era kijja kubaawo.
It was a sin.	Kyali kibi.
No luck there.	Tewali mukisa awo.
He said he really needed to talk to me.	Yagamba nti ddala yeetaaga okwogera nange.
It just had to do it.	Kyalina okukikola kyokka.
He is a romantic girlfriend.	Ye muganzi wa mukwano.
But he knew it wasn’t true.	Naye yali akimanyi nti si kituufu.
No one is doing anything.	Tewali akola kintu kyonna.
We are alone in the office.	Tuli ffekka mu ofiisi.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
Who it was supposed to be.	Ani kye kyalina okuba.
And she's pretty good too.	Era naye mulungi nnyo.
It will go away.	Kijja kugenda.
We are all here.	Ffenna tuli wano.
I thought we should.	Nalowooza nti tusaanidde.
It’s very, very bad.	Kibi nnyo nnyo.
Soon he got something.	Mu bbanga ttono yafuna ekintu.
It was a reasonable thing.	Kyali kya nsonga.
He would have to do it.	Yandibadde alina okukikola.
The guy needs this.	Ggaayi kino yeetaaga.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
I need to do it.	Nze nneetaaga okukikola.
Would you like to continue?.	Wandyagadde okugenda mu maaso?.
He didn't know how.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ki.
This is a terrible thing.	Kino kintu kibi nnyo.
Not exactly the case.	Si bwe kiri ddala.
Now we are here.	Kati tuli wano.
I do like this job.	Nkola nga omulimu guno.
That was more complicated than it is.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo okusinga bwe kiri.
Nothing for me at home.	Tewali kintu kyonna gyendi awaka.
For me, this is true.	Nze kino kituufu.
I should do it.	Nze nsaanidde okukikola.
You don’t even have to think about me.	Tolina wadde okulowooza ku nze.
He fell asleep.	Yeebase.
That was all he knew.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali amanyi.
But of course no one was.	Naye ddala tewali muntu yenna yali.
I hope he will do it.	Nsuubira nti ajja kukikola.
I think it’s great.	Ndowooza nti kirungi nnyo.
He was just a man.	Yali musajja yekka.
He certainly seems to be in good shape.	Mazima ddala alabika ali mu mbeera nnungi.
Terrible.	Kibi.
On each side.	Ku buli ludda.
He would be himself.	Yandibadde ye kennyini.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
You are not real.	Toli wa ddala.
But that was all he had.	Naye ekyo kyokka kye yalina.
That it had.	Nti kyalina.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
I'll just wait.	Nja kulinda kyokka.
It had to be a car.	Yalina okuba mmotoka.
He is very well.	Ali bulungi nnyo.
You were the only one.	Ggwe wekka gwe wali.
But you can spend the day.	Naye osobola okumala olunaku.
He was going to come.	Yali agenda kujja.
It’s simple and easy.	Kyangu era kyangu.
This is difficult to do.	Kino kizibu okukola.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
Is that good or bad? 	Ekyo kirungi oba kibi?
It’s on the side.	Kiri ku ludda.
They were friendly.	Baali ba mukwano.
But in a way, it was true.	Naye mu ngeri emu, kyali kituufu.
Now he had nothing.	Kati yali talina ky’alina.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
Someone should think about that.	Omuntu yandibadde alowooza ku ekyo.
He said he would do the same.	Yagambye nti naye ajja kukola kye kimu.
That’s not the case with me.	Ekyo si bwe kiri gyendi.
I was hoping you would.	Nnali nsuubira nti ojja kukikola.
You probably knew that.	Ekyo oboolyawo wali okimanyi.
We need to do it very quickly.	Tulina okukikola mu bwangu ddala.
Everyone did it.	Buli omu yakikola.
We’re all going to eat now.	Ffenna tugenda kulya kati.
Maybe you’ll be able to do it.	Mpozzi ojja kusobola okukikola.
And it’s very accurate.	Era nga kituufu nnyo.
He loves to do that, you know.	Ayagala nnyo okukola ekyo, omanyi.
However, it is not quite true.	Kyokka, si kituufu nnyo.
Maybe it was the case with me.	Mpozzi nga bwe kyali ku nze.
For us it will be costly.	Ffe kijja kuba kya ssente nnyingi.
He wasn’t dangerous.	Yali si wa bulabe.
But this is not a problem for us.	Naye kino si kizibu gye tuli.
But that doesn’t matter.	Naye ekyo si kikulu.
Both are.	Bombi bali...
And apparently that was the problem.	Era kirabika ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
But no' that's all.	Naye nedda' ekyo kyokka.
We all have a role to play.	Ffenna tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
But now this is it.	Naye kati kino kye kiri.
All right, that was it.	Kirungi, ekyo kye kyali.
It was really great.	Ddala kyali kikulu nnyo.
Surely he would be alone.	Mazima ddala yandibadde yekka.
But even this is not really true.	Naye ne kino mu butuufu si kituufu.
But in this case.	Naye mu mbeera eno.
Not quite, but close.	Si nnyo, naye kumpi.
Everyone did the same.	Buli omu yakola kye kimu.
I am so glad you are here!.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti oli wano!.
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
He knew how much his brother wanted to do it.	Yali amanyi engeri muganda we gye yali ayagala okukikola.
But you’re going to be fine.	Naye ogenda kuba bulungi.
I always knew these things.	Bulijjo ebintu bino nnali mmanyi.
It was all he could think to say.	Kye kyokka kye yali asobola okulowooza okwogera.
And he was in no hurry, either.	Era yali talina bwangu bwonna, era.
He was very willing.	Yali mwetegefu nnyo.
I have been a child in your house.	Mbadde mwana mu nnyumba yo.
I know what it looks like.	Nze mmanyi bwe kirabika.
You have the stuff.	Ggwe olina ebintu.
He saw everything.	Yalaba buli kimu.
I couldn’t see anything.	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
Not quite right yet.	Si kituufu nnyo n’okutuusa kati.
And there’s me.	Era waliwo nze.
He should have done it.	Yandibadde akikola.
It’s that time, you know.	Kye kiseera ekyo, omanyi.
He had no interest in her.	Yali talina ky’ayagala ku ye.
You can’t let this go on.	Kino tosobola kukkiriza kugenda mu maaso.
Here is another one.	Wano waliwo omulala.
I know exactly where they are.	Nze mmanyi bulungi gye bali.
Maybe you don’t have one.	Mpozzi nga tolina.
I’m a young man.	Nze ndi muto.
That’s not good at all.	Ekyo si kirungi n’akatono.
We’ll do that during the week.	Ekyo tujja kukikola mu wiiki.
He doesn’t have much money.	Talina ssente nnyingi.
He doesn’t have a house.	Talina nnyumba.
We can do much better than this.	Tusobola okukola obulungi ennyo okusinga kino.
We’re going to be here for a little while.	Tugenda kubeera wano akaseera katono.
This afternoon .	Akawungeezi ka leero .
Someone has to help someone.	Omuntu alina okuyamba omuntu.
You probably already know that.	Ekyo oboolyawo okimanyi dda.
I know, everyone says that.	Nkimanyi, buli omu ayogera bw’atyo.
But it’s so bad.	Naye kibi nnyo.
We are very low.	Tuli wansi nnyo.
But there is nothing.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna.
I have to tell someone.	Nnina okubuulira omuntu.
Getting in trouble.	Okufuna obuzibu.
I’ve always loved the guy.	Bulijjo njagala nnyo ggaayi.
But it was at home.	Naye nga waka.
Maybe he's not here.	Mpozzi nga tali wano.
Not in that way.	Si mu ngeri eyo.
Maybe it will help, maybe not.	Mpozzi kijja kuyamba, mpozzi nedda.
It comes very close.	Kijja kumpi nnyo.
It would be nice.	Kyandibadde kirungi.
But that was what he wanted.	Naye ekyo kye yali ayagala.
And of course he came.	Era ddala yajja.
You will have to do it yourself.	Ojja kuba olina okukikola ggwe kennyini.
Perhaps that is not quite true.	Oboolyawo ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
Don’t come to town.	Tojja mu kibuga.
I knew better.	Nze nnali mmanyi bulungi.
No one can do this.	Kino tewali asobola kukikola.
I can’t do that myself.	Nze kennyini ekyo sisobola kukikola.
It’s simple, and really, really good.	Kyangu, era ddala, ddala kirungi.
He talks about it.	Ayogera ku nsonga eyo.
That seems to be the norm.	Ekyo kirabika kye kya bulijjo.
Now he would do what he needed to do tonight.	Kati yandikoze kye yali yeetaaga okukola ekiro kino.
I think you’re the best.	Ndowooza ggwe asinga.
It’s going to be very difficult.	Kigenda kuba kizibu nnyo.
I am currently unemployed.	Nze mu kiseera kino sirina mulimu.
Not him either.	Si ye naye.
But for him.	Naye ku ye.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
He didn’t know what and he didn’t know why.	Yali tamanyi kiki era nga tamanyi lwaki.
He knew that too.	Ne ye ekyo yali akimanyi.
He was going to be fine.	Yali agenda kuba bulungi.
I will do that again.	Ekyo nja kuddamu okukikola.
I just want to talk to him.	Njagala kwogera naye kyokka.
He is not alone in this sentiment.	Si ye yekka mu ndowooza eno.
That's really the whole point for something like this.	Ekyo ddala ensonga yonna eri ekintu nga kino.
You absolutely have to do it.	Olina ddala okukikola.
I can't reason why.	Sisobola nsonga lwaki.
I wondered to myself.	Nze ne nneebuuza.
You don’t know anything.	Tomanyi kintu kyonna.
It was probably me.	Oboolyawo nnali nze.
I'm like you.	Nze nga ggwe.
Not bad, just obvious.	Si kibi, kya lwatu kyokka.
It’s a matter of doing it.	Ensonga ya kukikola.
That was almost .	Ekyo kyali kumpi .
He was happy	Yali musanyufu .
This would be good for you, in any case.	Kino kyandibadde kirungi gy’oli, mu mbeera yonna.
He agreed to go with me.	Yakkiriza okugenda nange.
It goes quickly.	Kigenda mangu.
But he didn’t want to believe it.	Naye yali tayagala kukkiriza.
He says so, himself.	Agamba bw’atyo, ye kennyini.
I could have done it.	Nnali nsobola okukikola.
And he knew she knew it.	Era yali akimanyi nti yali akimanyi.
I couldn’t wait to go.	Nnali siyinza kulinda kugenda.
a.	omu.
I want to be with him.	Njagala kubeera naye.
I'm afraid.	Nze ntya.
Everyone who wants one has it.	Buli ayagala emu alina.
But he could not do this alone.	Naye kino yali tasobola kukikola yekka.
He's on her.	Ali ku ye.
I may not know anything.	Nnyinza okuba nga sirina kye mmanyi.
And he’s ready to do it again.	Era mwetegefu okuddamu okukikola.
It was a devastating experience for everyone.	Kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo eri buli muntu.
It is absolutely true.	Kituufu ddala.
It’s my opinion, of course.	Kye ndowooza yange, ddala.
That was all he needed.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali yeetaaga.
I am not dangerous to you.	Siri wa bulabe gy’oli.
I also know why you are there.	Nze era mmanyi lwaki oli awo.
That’s not really what it was.	Ekyo si kye kyali ddala.
He was a lot like you.	Yali nnyo nga ggwe.
That’s really quite common.	Ekyo ddala kya bulijjo nnyo.
That was the picture.	Ekyo kye kyali ekifaananyi.
Now he can do many things.	Kati asobola okukola ebintu bingi.
Another one is here.	Omulala ali wano.
Everyone is really friendly.	Buli muntu ddala wa mukwano.
as beautiful as he was.	nga bwe yali omulungi.
Just my father.	Taata wange yekka.
We’re all going to stay together.	Ffenna tugenda kusigala wamu.
What a wonderful man he is.	Nga musajja mulungi nnyo.
Even if they were, it doesn’t matter.	Ne bwe baali, si kikulu.
Good job.	Omulimu omulungi.
In fact, nothing seemed to matter.	Mu butuufu, tewali kyali kirabika nga kikulu.
We are neutral.	Ffe tetulina ludda.
You don’t have too much time for this.	Tolina budde bungi nnyo ku kino.
Thus there is no problem.	Bwatyo tewali buzibu.
And here they are.	Era wano we bali.
That would be hard to say no to.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu okugamba nti nedda.
I could have gone on.	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu maaso.
We are alone, we are alone, and we will remain alone.	Tuli ffekka, tuli ffekka, era tujja kusigala ffekka.
He said he would be there.	Yagamba nti ajja kubeerawo.
Anyone else had this problem before.	Omuntu omulala yenna yalina ekizibu kino emabegako.
That nothing mattered but me.	Nti tewali kyali kikulu okuggyako nze.
He just isn’t alone.	Ye yekka si ye yekka.
It’s certainly nothing of the sort.	Mazima ddala si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
But you can help.	Naye osobola okuyamba.
We have everything we need.	Tulina buli kye twetaaga.
Everything was on point.	Buli kimu kyali ku nsonga.
I will do it right.	Nja kukikola bulungi.
But it would be awful.	Naye kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
Clearly, he was in no hurry.	Kya lwatu nti yali talina bwangu bwonna.
And he doesn’t know why.	Era tamanyi lwaki.
I guess it’s not.	Ntebereza nti si bwe kiri.
I can’t see those.	Sisobola kulaba ebyo.
So far, it seemed.	Okutuuka kati, kyali kirabika.
To us, another.	Eri ffe, omulala.
I want to help.	Njagala okuyamba.
I have one myself.	Nze kennyini nnina emu.
But there is no bottom.	Naye tewali wansi.
The other was a guy doing reading.	Omulala yali ggaayi akola okusoma.
That’s an idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo.
I know that we are.	Nkimanyi nti tuli.
It’s not like a city bus.	Si nga bbaasi ya kibuga.
Every day, someone was.	Buli lunaku, waliwo omuntu yali...
Not that this mattered.	Si nti kino kyali kikulu.
But that’s not quite right.	Naye ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
You go on to the party.	Ogenda mu maaso ku mbaga.
. . . .	.
It was a serious problem.	Kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
Do you work too?.	Naawe okola?.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
So he will always be.	Bw’atyo ajja kuba bw’atyo bulijjo.
We all have help.	Ffenna tulina obuyambi.
And this work is by no means unusual.	Era omulimu guno si gwa bulijjo n’akatono.
He needed to see.	Yali yeetaaga okulaba.
He is doing well now.	Akola bulungi kati.
He may return as soon as tonight.	Ayinza okudda amangu ddala ekiro kino.
The same thing, of course.	Ekintu kye kimu, ddala.
The food was a mess.	Emmere yali ya buzibu.
He didn’t want to do this.	Kino yali tayagala kukikola.
He acted quickly.	Yakola mangu.
However, it is not.	Kyokka si ekyo.
I couldn’t, not for long.	Nnali sisobola, si lwa bbanga ddene.
I got my phone now.	Nfunye essimu yange kati.
To me, it doesn’t matter.	Eri nze, si kikulu.
This was very easy.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo.
This is the case in my case.	Kino bwe kiri mu mbeera yange.
I have nothing to do here.	Wano sirina kye nkola.
I am sure tomorrow everything will be .	Nkakasa enkya buli kimu kijja kuba .
And that’s right.	Era ekyo kituufu.
I feel this is unusual.	Mpulira kino si kya bulijjo.
Apparently it was very difficult to go.	Kirabika kyali kizibu nnyo okugenda.
That anyone else could be.	Nti omuntu omulala yenna asobola okuba.
He had already dealt with this.	Yali amaze okukola ku nsonga eno.
It was a beautiful place.	Kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
Everyone will work.	Buli omu ajja kukola.
I’m going to the movies.	Ngenda mu firimu.
We’ll have dinner soon.	Tugenda kulya ekyeggulo mu bbanga ttono.
He was the one who knew best.	Ye yali asinga okumanya.
He couldn’t even see.	Yali tasobola na kulaba.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
You can probably see where this is going.	Oboolyawo osobola okulaba kino gye kigenda.
But, in reality, this is not a problem.	Naye, mu butuufu, kino si kizibu.
I was very close to him too.	Nange nnali kumpi nnyo naye.
Not all of it, of course.	Si byonna, ddala.
I will never allow that to happen again.	Ekyo sijja kuddamu kukkiriza kubaawo.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
I'm not, now.	Siri, kati.
Or he would if he was here.	Oba yandikoze singa yali wano.
My phone started up like before.	Essimu yange yatandika nga bwe yali emabegako.
At that point we will be able to help.	Mu kiseera ekyo tujja kusobola okuyamba.
And not everyone is sick at all.	Era si buli muntu nti mulwadde n’akatono.
Here is a .	Wano waliwo .
He hoped that would be all he would need.	Yalina essuubi nti ekyo kyokka kye yandibadde yeetaaga.
I just know we have to arrive.	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti tulina okutuuka.
They were very practical.	Baali ba nkola nnyo.
Anyone at all.	Omuntu yenna n’akatono.
He is not like us.	Tali nga ffe.
I don’t want to speak for anyone.	Saagala kwogera ku lwa muntu yenna.
He comes with us.	Ajja naffe.
Not a very good organization.	Si kibiina kirungi nnyo.
This is not serious.	Kino si kya maanyi.
But we will win.	Naye tujja kuwangula.
Actually, that’s an issue.	Mu butuufu, eyo nsonga.
You have to preach.	Ggwe olina okubuulira.
He had been a good father.	Yali abadde taata mulungi.
All he had to do was have none at all.	Kye yalina okukola kyali talina ky’alina n’akatono.
To me it is very important.	Eri nze kikulu nnyo.
Not very friendly.	Si wa mukwano nnyo.
I need a job.	Nze nneetaaga omulimu.
Or not who knows.	Oba si ani amanyi.
No one is here.	Tewali muntu yenna ali wano.
But it’s not me, it’s the woman.	Naye si nze, ye mukyala.
And you know why.	Era omanyi lwaki.
I don’t really care what you want.	Sifaayo nnyo ku ky’oyagala.
Everyone was so happy and I, too.	Buli omu yali musanyufu nnyo era nange, nange.
It’s the same everywhere.	Buli wamu kye kimu.
That was the hope, anyway.	Ekyo kye kyali essuubi, mu ngeri yonna.
But this is not good.	Naye kino si kirungi.
In fact, he hadn’t.	Mu butuufu, yali talina.
We are together every day.	Tuli wamu buli lunaku.
This is bad, bad, bad.	Kino kibi, kibi, kibi.
I have hope.	Nnina essuubi.
This is a very bad problem.	Kino kizibu kibi nnyo.
I have a day	Nnina olunaku .
I have a lot of money.	Nnina ssente nnyingi.
No one was in sight.	Tewali yali alabika.
Not everyone does, you know.	Si buli muntu nti akola, omanyi.
I hope this will help.	Nsuubira kino kijja kuyamba.
Daddy won’t eat.	Taata tajja kulya.
I really don’t know my son.	Mazima ddala simanyi mwana wange.
This is, of course, not realistic in practice.	Kino, kya lwatu, si kya ddala mu nkola.
We can’t live without it.	Tetusobola kubeerawo nga tetulina.
They are currently in the.	Mu kiseera kino bali mu...
At the time, it certainly wasn’t.	Mu kiseera ekyo, mazima ddala si bwe kyali.
This will be enough.	Kino kijja kumala.
I think all of this.	Ndowooza bino byonna.
He himself felt empty.	Ye kennyini yawulira nga talina kintu kyonna.
I can't answer .	Sisobola kuddamu .
He couldn’t go on.	Yali tasobola kugenda mu maaso.
Nothing now.	Tewali kintu kyonna kati.
From so close to him.	Okuva kumpi nnyo naye.
We are in trouble.	Tuli mu buzibu.
It would be very difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
I have to work.	Nnina okukola.
At home like everything else.	Awaka nga buli kimu.
He couldn’t speak at all.	Yali tasobola kwogera n’akatono.
Herein lies the problem.	Wano we wali ekizibu.
And he's doing fine so far for me.	Era akola bulungi okutuuka wano gyendi.
We have a problem there.	Tulina ekizibu eyo.
The same thing is happening now.	Ekintu kye kimu kye kigenda mu maaso kati.
I can’t wait for that one.	Sisobola kulinda oyo.
You’re going to do it my way.	Ogenda kukikola mu ngeri yange.
We’re going to go a lot.	Tugenda kugenda nnyo.
And that was .	Era ekyo kyali .
I didn’t want to know more.	Nnali saagala kumanya bingi.
You can’t and won’t win.	Tosobola era tojja kuwangula.
That is not true by any means.	Ekyo si kituufu mu ngeri yonna.
It was only a matter of time.	Yali nsonga ya kiseera kyokka.
As it is today.	Nga bwe kiri leero.
Not really at home.	Si mu butuufu waka.
He was young.	Yali muto.
And you absolutely will.	Era ojja kukikola ddala.
Maybe like us.	Mpozzi nga ffe.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka kino si kya mazima.
It will always be there.	Kijja kubaawo bulijjo.
But now his dad had a dog.	Naye kati taata we yalina embwa.
He might do to it what he would do.	Ayinza okukikola kye yandikoze.
We are not in danger.	Tetulina bulabe.
I am not a party.	Nze siri kibiina.
I don’t know what to do about it.	Simanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eno.
He couldn’t see a stranger.	Yali tasobola kulaba muntu gwe yali tamanyi.
You are nothing like him.	Toli kintu kyonna nga ye.
Ready or not here goes.	Mwetegefu oba nedda wano agenda.
Nothing important though.	Tewali kikulu wadde.
I need to go to the hospital.	Nze nneetaaga okugenda mu ddwaaliro.
Of course, he is.	Kya lwatu nti y’ali.
He was always asleep at night.	Bulijjo yali yeebase ekiro.
It was a daunting thought.	Kyali kirowoozo ekizibu ennyo.
I know he was.	Nkimanyi nti yali.
You’ve been here a long time.	Obadde wano ebbanga ddene.
Book? 	Ekitabo?
. . . .	.
It was a great atmosphere, really.	Yali mbeera nnungi nnyo, ddala.
I feel better tonight.	Mpulira bulungi ekiro kino.
Right down, actually.	Wansi ddala, mu butuufu.
It’s not too difficult.	Si kizibu nnyo.
I won’t believe it.	Sijja kukkiriza.
Probably a lot of things.	Oboolyawo ebintu bingi.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola.
You certainly do.	Mazima ddala ggwe okola.
We’re going to be fine.	Tugenda kuba bulungi.
Perhaps he always knew.	Oboolyawo bulijjo yali akimanyi.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
No one knew for sure.	Tewali yali amanyi bulungi.
It’s a very good thing.	Kintu kirungi nnyo.
I really could have.	Ddala nnali nsobola.
And he could easily get what he wanted.	Era yali asobola bulungi okufuna kye yali ayagala.
I am a happy man.	Ndi musajja musanyufu.
Right now, we don’t.	Mu kiseera kino, tetulina.
But why? 	Naye lwaki?
And that will continue.	Era ekyo kijja kugenda mu maaso.
He went away happy.	Yagenda nga musanyufu.
Maybe you should do the same.	Mpozzi naawe wandibadde okola ekintu kye kimu.
There is no one here.	Wano tewali muntu yenna.
I was afraid of something.	Nali ntya ekintu.
Everyone seems very friendly.	Buli omu alabika wa mukwano nnyo.
It will be easier for you.	Kijja kuba kyangu gy’oli.
Very very very very.	Ennyo nnyo nnyo.
Not just one guy, though.	Si ggaayi omu yekka, wadde.
And he fell asleep.	Era yeebase.
No one knew where we were going.	Tewali yali amanyi gye twali tugenda kugenda.
I am now desperate.	Nze kati nfunye essuubi.
There is a good chance that everything will be fine.	Waliwo omukisa omulungi nti buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi.
I am alone, alone.	Nze nzekka, nzekka.
Now you will know.	Kati ojja kumanya.
But it’s going on.	Naye kigenda mu maaso.
I think that was his thing.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kyali ekintu kye.
You will talk to him yourself.	Ggwe kennyini ojja kwogera naye.
But there was someone else.	Naye nga waliwo omuntu omulala.
I have to move on.	Nnina okugenda mu maaso.
But that’s not me.	Naye oyo si nze.
He doesn’t need more than that.	Teyeetaaga okusinga ekyo.
I don’t know what’s going to happen now.	Simanyi kigenda kubaawo kati.
He is not alone	Si ye yekka .
That would be very difficult.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
Now you are good to go now.	Kati oli mulungi okugenda kati.
One came to me.	Omu yajja gyendi.
He has been in need of help.	Abadde yeetaaga obuyambi.
Or who he was.	Oba ani gwe yali.
He was a little sleepy, but only a little sleepy.	Yali yeebase katono, naye nga yeebase katono ddala.
Down he goes.	Wansi agenda.
We have no intention of doing so.	Tetulina ndowooza yonna ya kukikola.
He certainly was.	Mazima ddala yali.
I hope you love it.	Nsuubira nti oyagala nnyo.
And it is true	Era kituufu .
And it’s one on one.	Era nga kimu ku kimu.
Not to me or anyone else.	Si gyendi oba eri omuntu omulala yenna.
I was here all night.	Nali wano ekiro kyonna.
Granted, that would be a bad thing.	Kituufu nti ekyo kyandibadde kintu kibi.
You can help with that too.	Naawe osobola okuyamba ku ekyo.
He was not in a good mood.	Yali talina mbeera nnungi.
I hope we shall see.	Nsuubira tujja kulaba.
He could have been like.	Yali asobola okuba nga.
I think we can’t do it.	Ndowooza tetusobola kukikola.
It’s not the same thing at all.	Si kintu kye kimu n’akatono.
It seems that .	Kirabika nga .
You don’t even know what you want.	Tomanyi na kyoyagala.
He knew there was no better place than to be with her.	Yali akimanyi nti tewali kifo kirungi okusinga okubeera naye.
I thought there was.	Nalowooza nti waliwo.
There is nothing to see.	Tewali kintu kyonna kya kulaba.
I have no idea what it is.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki.
We will do it.	Tujja kukikola.
You can’t live here.	Tosobola kubeera wano.
It is not	Si ne .
I will be here for the weekend.	Nja kubeera wano ku wiikendi.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo kye kyali.
I feel really young to be dealing with this.	Mpulira ddala muto nnyo okubeera nga nkola ku nsonga eno.
I can’t say exactly how long.	Siyinza kwogera ddala bbanga ki.
I'm not sure if that's the point or not.	Sikakasa oba eyo y'ensonga oba nedda.
But what .	Naye kiki .
And that’s not all.	Era ekyo si kye kyokka.
That is not uncommon.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo.
He would love to talk.	Yandiyagadde nnyo okwogera.
Unusual.	Si kya bulijjo.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
He knew he was there.	Yali akimanyi nti yali awo.
Or it could be a little more complicated than that.	Oba kiyinza okuba nga kizibu katono okusinga ekyo.
Not for that reason, of course.	Si lwa nsonga eyo, ddala.
But the dog	Naye embwa .
It would certainly be easier.	Mazima ddala kyandibadde kyangu.
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
I don’t know what to say about that.	Simanyi kya kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
I love it so much.	Nze njagala nnyo.
I’m working quickly.	Nze nkola mangu.
They were both very strong.	Bombi baali ba maanyi nnyo.
Now is such a time.	Kati kye kiseera ng’ekyo.
I love everything he did.	Njagala nnyo buli kye yakola.
I would love to do it again.	Njagala nnyo okuddamu okukikola.
He can be .	Asobola okuba nga .
You are a beautiful woman.	Ggwe oli mukyala mulungi.
What we need now is .	Kye twetaaga kati kiri nti .
In the classroom now.	Mu kibiina kati.
I live alone.	Mbeera nzekka.
But so far so good.	Naye okutuuka kati kirungi nnyo.
I’m sure he’ll try to get those too.	Nkakasa nti naye ajja kugezaako okufuna ebyo.
He was a good and good man .	Yali musajja mulungi era mulungi .
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
However, no one is home.	Kyokka tewali muntu yenna ali waka.
I am not alone.	Siri nzekka.
He said he thought it would be great for me.	Yagambye nti alowooza nti kijja kuba kirungi nnyo gyendi.
Or it could be .	Oba kiyinza okuba nga .
But we have hope.	Naye tulina essuubi.
But you already have it.	Naye ggwe olina dda.
All there, he saw.	Byonna awo, yalaba.
Nothing was normal.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyali kya bulijjo.
In a sense.	Mu ngeri emu.
But this is not my whole point.	Naye eno si nsonga yange yonna.
You have to know what my father was doing.	Olina okumanya taata kye yali akola.
No, it was awful in a way.	Nedda, kyali kibi nnyo mu ngeri emu.
In a sense, that is true.	Mu ngeri emu, ekyo kituufu.
And he did it himself.	Era ye kennyini ye yakikola.
And it was pretty cool.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo.
It was, you know.	Yali, omanyi.
Not anything like that now.	Si kintu kyonna nga ekyo kati.
That's the whole thing.	Ekyo kye kintu kyonna.
Like being, in my case.	Nga okubeera, mu mbeera yange.
Or you can.	Oba osobola.
I’m doing a good job.	Nkola omulimu mulungi.
Reading is very important.	Okusoma kikulu nnyo.
Not every doctor is willing to do that.	Si buli musawo nti mwetegefu okukola ekyo.
No, not as close as we are.	Nedda, si nga tuli kumpi nnyo.
We are really alone.	Ffe ddala tuli ffekka.
He had to be here.	Yalina okubeera wano.
But that can be a challenge.	Naye ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
But with one thing .	Naye nga waliwo ekintu kimu .
You have to do the same.	Naawe olina okukola kye kimu.
I know it’s not him.	Nkimanyi si ye.
You work very, very hard.	Okola nnyo nnyo.
It’s so important for you!.	Kikulu nnyo ku ggwe!.
I feel it and I know it.	Mpulira era nkimanyi.
I’m sure that will work out.	Nkakasa nti ekyo kijja kugenda bulungi.
You have to do this.	Kino olina okukola.
I wasn’t even in town at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sirina wadde mu kibuga.
I can’t go to work.	Sisobola kugenda ku mulimu.
It seems rather .	Kirabika okusinga .
He needed to be alone here.	Yali yeetaaga okubeera yekka wano.
I really, really am.	Nze ddala, ddala ndi.
He was definitely something.	Mazima ddala yali kintu.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
It was always just him.	Bulijjo yali ye yekka.
In fact, he could do it.	Mu butuufu, yali asobola okukikola.
And so was my father.	Era ne taata bwe yali.
He will never again accept office.	Tajja kuddamu kukkiriza ofiisi.
I can’t say what’s going to happen.	Siyinza kwogera kigenda kubaawo.
You can buy one here.	Osobola okugula emu wano.
He tried hard.	Yagezaako nnyo.
We can’t know anything.	Tetusobola kumanya kintu kyonna.
That looks good to me.	Ekyo kirabika bulungi gyendi.
We cannot continue to do this.	Kino tetusobola kugenda mu maaso na kukola.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
He was the best at that.	Ye yali asinga mu ekyo.
He came but didn’t know what to do.	Yajja naye nga tamanyi kya kukola.
So far, no response.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali kuddamu.
Until he .	Okutuusa ye .
But that was going to happen.	Naye ekyo kyali kigenda kubaawo.
You will love it.	Ojja kwagala nnyo.
I could see things too.	Nange nnali nsobola okulaba ebintu.
That’s a great idea.	Eyo ndowooza nnungi nnyo.
That’s a lot of money.	Oyo ssente nnyingi nnyo.
Not even then together.	Si ne mu kiseera ekyo nga bali bombi.
I wish he was here.	Njagala yandibadde wano.
You will see, you will see.	Ojja kulaba, ojja kulaba.
He says he would love to go.	Agamba nti yandiyagadde nnyo okugenda.
Call his dad.	Kuba ku taata we.
He said he didn’t want to.	Yagambye nti tayagala.
. . . .	.
I am not sure about this.	Sikakasa ku nsonga eno.
I am not alone by any means.	Siri nzekka mu ngeri yonna.
She was his wife now.	Yali mukyala we kati.
Whatever is going to happen is going to happen.	Kyonna ekigenda okubaawo kigenda kubaawo.
He was obviously happy.	Kya lwatu nti yali musanyufu.
Everything was great.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi nnyo.
And it is very dangerous.	Era kya bulabe nnyo.
That’s what it is now.	Ekyo kiri kati.
Surely, you know that.	Mazima ddala, ekyo okimanyi.
He probably has a point though.	Oboolyawo alina ensonga wadde.
In fact, it was normal.	Mu butuufu, kyali kya bulijjo.
I guess it was pretty simple.	Ntebereza nti kyali kyangu nnyo.
The point is this.	Ensonga eri nti eno.
He knows exactly what he has to do.	Amanyi bulungi ky’alina okukola.
But step back.	Naye dda emabega.
I was certainly very happy with this.	Mazima ddala kino nnali musanyufu nnyo.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
We need a reason.	Twetaaga ensonga.
That's what it is, and all that.	Ekyo kye kiri, era ebyo byonna.
And my son, my son.	Era mwana wange, mwana wange.
He hoped this would work.	Yalina essuubi nti kino kijja kukola.
But he is my best friend.	Naye ye mukwano gwange asinga.
This was a movie.	Eno yali firimu.
Not always, of course.	Si bulijjo, ddala.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
But he is fine.	Naye ali bulungi.
What he did.	Kye yakola.
He plays very well.	Akuba bulungi nnyo.
He looked very unhappy.	Yalabika nga si musanyufu nnyo.
It’s not going to come easy.	Si kigenda kujja kyangu.
It is very simple and easy.	Kyangu nnyo era kyangu.
He spoke well, of course.	Yayogera bulungi, ddala.
I'm going quickly.	Ngenda mangu.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
I want to be.	Njagala kubeera.
And we’re not the only ones.	Era si ffe ffekka.
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
It’s just one thing.	Kintu kimu kyokka.
And you can do it.	Era osobola okukikola.
You will get lucky.	Ojja kufuna omukisa.
Like my son.	Nga mwana wange.
He really didn't want to talk about it now.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eno kati.
I was almost certain.	Nali kumpi nkakasa nti.
You have a job.	Olina omulimu.
Must know how to read.	Alina okumanya okusoma.
There is nothing to see here.	Wano tewali kya kulaba.
I love everybody.	Njagala nnyo buli muntu.
And three hours a day.	Era essaawa ssatu olunaku.
There is no telling who that child belongs to.	Tewali kubuulira mwana oyo wa ani.
It was the way it is.	Yali ngeri gye kiri.
This is good for us.	Kino kirungi gye tuli.
He is a sick child.	Ye mwana mulwadde.
It wasn’t much of an issue.	Yali si nnyo nsonga.
And he always was.	Era bulijjo yali.
But we need to do it.	Naye twetaaga okukikola.
However, he was strong.	Kyokka yali wa maanyi.
But in this case, you don’t have to.	Naye mu mbeera eno, tolina kukikola.
Now what are you going to do.	Kati ogenda kukola ki.
She is a very nice, ordinary, willing woman.	Mukyala mulungi nnyo, wa bulijjo, mwetegefu.
It’s simple, quick and easy.	Kyangu, kyangu era kyangu.
He couldn’t have been luckier.	Yali tayinza kuba wa mukisa okusinga ekyo.
You’re a great guy.	Oli ggaayi omulungi ennyo.
However, this is not entirely the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri ddala.
And it’s so bad.	Era nga kibi nnyo.
He is not to be.	Tali wa kubeera.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
And it’s much more complicated than that.	Era kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
The house is beautiful.	Ennyumba nnungi.
What is going on here? 	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso wano?
My wife doesn’t want to go home.	Mukyala wange tayagala kudda waka.
He looked like he needed help too.	Yalabika nga naye yeetaaga obuyambi.
That was why he was here.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki yali wano.
I really want to know why.	Nze ddala njagala okumanya lwaki.
I hope that’s what it is.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kye kiri.
She was that beautiful.	Yali mulungi bw’atyo.
He probably already knew.	Oboolyawo yali amanyi dda.
Nothing so far.	Tewali kintu kyonna okutuusa kati.
But no one was in sight.	Naye tewali yali alabika.
But that’s neither here nor there right now.	Naye ekyo si wano si awo mu kiseera kino.
It’s very, very simple.	Kyangu nnyo nnyo.
However, I am so glad he did.	Kyokka ndi musanyufu nnyo nti yakikola.
It’s not his job.	Si mulimu gwe.
There is no best practice.	Tewali nkola nnungi.
I want to go into that a little bit.	Njagala kugenda mu ekyo katono.
He came up with none.	Yajja nga tewali.
Today, however, he was in good shape.	Kyokka leero yali mu mbeera nnungi.
He goes to the house.	Agenda ku nnyumba.
It’s not anyone’s business.	Si nsonga ya muntu yenna.
But he had a plan.	Naye yalina enteekateeka.
He was her friend.	Yali mukwano gwe.
The film did well.	Firimu eyo yakola bulungi.
We cannot accept this view.	Tetusobola kukkiriza ndowooza eno.
Which he knew well.	Kye yali akimanyi bulungi.
I won’t have any of that.	Sijja kuba na kimu ku ebyo.
And money, of course.	Era ssente, ddala.
Almost every situation.	Kumpi buli mbeera.
Now is the time!.	Kati kye kiseera!.
That was the plan, anyway.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka, mu ngeri yonna.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si kye kituufu.
But he’s still here.	Naye akyali wano.
He can do it.	Asobola okukikola.
All of us here too.	Ffenna wano naffe.
I'll go with you.	Nja kugenda naawe.
It’s really all about him.	Ddala byonna ye.
This was short-term.	Kino kyali kya mu bbanga ttono.
And you can’t.	Era tosobola.
That’s all we are.	Ekyo kyokka kye tuli.
Everyone is trying to make money .	Buli omu agezaako okufuna ssente .
This is definitely me too.	Kino mazima ddala nange.
That’s what’s here.	Ekyo kye kiri wano.
But here .	Naye wano .
It had to work, he thought.	Kyalina okukola, bwe yalowooza.
But there is nothing of the sort here.	Naye wano tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo.
I really should go.	Ddala nsaanidde okugenda.
Everything is fine, everything is good.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi, buli kimu kirungi.
I hope that was the case.	Nsuubira nti bwe kyali.
So he asked his younger brother the reason.	Bwatyo yabuuza muto we ensonga.
I hope that’s good.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kirungi.
This was my problem.	Kino kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
But not much yet.	Naye si bingi n’okutuusa kati.
And he was beautiful.	Era yali mulungi.
Honestly, it doesn’t really matter now.	Mu butuufu, kati si kikulu nnyo.
I was working.	Nnali nkola.
He doesn’t have to talk to me.	Talina kwogera nange.
To do that, you’d have to be good.	Ekyo okukikola, wandibadde olina okuba omulungi.
I was afraid of everything.	Nnali ntya buli kimu.
In fact, it’s awful.	Mu butuufu, kibi nnyo.
It’s easy that way.	Kyangu mu ngeri eyo.
That’s a short-term one.	Ekyo kya bbanga ttono.
He doesn't know if he went to the office.	Tamanyi oba yagenda mu ofiisi.
That’s certainly not the case here.	Ekyo mazima ddala si bwe kiri wano.
He was the best in his class.	Yali asinga mu kibiina kye.
Or he didn’t want to.	Oba yali tayagala.
It’s not more complicated than that.	Si kizibu okusinga ekyo.
You have to work with us.	Olina okukola naffe.
I have my own plan.	Nnina enteekateeka yange.
No money if no response.	Tewali ssente singa tewali kuddamu.
No one knows exactly why.	Tewali amanyi bulungi lwaki.
And this is just one room.	Era kino kisenge kimu kyokka.
What a day, what a day.	Nga lunaku, nga lunaku.
He was probably a child.	Oboolyawo yali mwana muto.
And it seems to be true.	Era kirabika nga kituufu.
He had no place here.	Wano yali talina kifo kyonna.
And it is very true.	Era kituufu nnyo.
My brother can say whatever he wants.	Muganda wange asobola okwogera kyonna ky’ayagala.
He completely agreed.	Yakkiriza ddala.
That’s the whole point.	Eyo y’ensonga yonna.
But he would have.	Naye yandibadde.
I'll try to think of something over the weekend.	Nja kugezaako okulowooza ku kintu ku wiikendi.
And that’s not good.	Era ekyo si kirungi.
And it was a very, very difficult time.	Era kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo nnyo.
It is important to speak up.	Kikulu okwogera.
I won’t do that.	Ekyo sijja kukikola.
However, he was very good.	Kyokka yali mulungi nnyo.
But not really.	Naye si ddala.
There were many reasons for that.	Ensonga eyo yalina ensonga nnyingi.
In the	Kati ka .
I know we can do it now.	Nkimanyi nti tusobola okukikola kati.
He had no idea who it was.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku ani.
But we must act quickly.	Naye tulina okukola amangu.
That he is fine.	Nti ali bulungi.
And he's not alone in this, either.	Era si ye yekka mu nsonga eno, era.
But he didn’t want to do it.	Naye yali tayagala kukikola.
Probably the only one.	Oboolyawo nga ye yekka.
Everyone was working.	Buli omu yali akola.
For about an hour.	Okumala essaawa nga emu.
And then he thought he saw.	Era awo n’alowooza nti yalaba.
He wasn’t well.	Yali si bulungi.
It’s hard, but it will happen.	Kizibu naye kijja kubaawo.
He admitted that he was very good.	Yakkiriza nti yali mulungi nnyo.
That will work just fine.	Ekyo kijja kukola bulungi nnyo.
We have to do well.	Tulina okukola obulungi.
We’re going together.	Tugenda ffembi.
He didn’t like it when he did that.	Yali tayagala bwe yakola ekyo.
He's a really nice person, you know.	Ye muntu mulungi ddala, omanyi.
He was making it so easy.	Yali akikola nga kyangu nnyo.
He was glad he had.	Yali musanyufu nti yalina.
He was ready to go, anyway.	Yali mwetegefu okugenda, mu ngeri yonna.
I'll be back next weekend.	Nja kudda wiikendi ejja.
But no, this wasn’t his problem.	Naye nedda, kino si kye kyali ekizibu kye.
To be as it is.	Okubeera nga bwe kiri.
It was really low.	Ddala kyali wansi.
And to be myself.	Era okubeera nze kennyini.
Call for help.	Kuba essimu okufuna obuyambi.
They are just fine.	Bali bulungi kyokka.
But he seems very happy.	Naye alabika nga musanyufu nnyo.
No one was younger.	Tewali yali muto.
You should buy the book.	Olina okugula ekitabo ekyo.
But it’s still the same problem.	Naye nga n’okutuusa kati ekizibu kye kimu.
I know, he said.	Nkimanyi, bwe yagamba.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
This is what I want.	Kino kye njagala.
It’s a dangerous job.	Omulimu gwa bulabe.
I thought it was a normal thing.	Nalowooza nti kintu kya bulijjo.
But not for long.	Naye si kya bbanga ddene.
I'm really afraid, you know.	Mazima ddala ntya, omanyi.
He couldn’t see anything at all.	Yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna n’akatono.
That’s my guy.	Oyo ye ggaayi wange.
I was actually terrified.	Mu butuufu nnali ntya nnyo.
But for now, you’ll be fine.	Naye mu kiseera kino, ojja kuba bulungi.
However, he said nothing.	Kyokka, tewali kye yayogera.
Hope that might help someone else.	Essuubi nti ekyo kiyinza okuyamba omuntu omulala.
He was a good man.	Yali muntu mulungi.
I had nowhere to live.	Nnali sirina we nnali mbeera.
It was always bad.	Bulijjo kyali kibi.
It was a beautiful thing.	Kyali kintu kirungi nnyo.
He was more than just a friend.	Yali asinga mukwano gwange yekka.
He was the only one who felt awkward about it.	Ye yekka ye yawulira nga alina ekizibu ku nsonga eyo.
But he couldn’t.	Naye yali tasobola.
And he could see why.	Era yali asobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
He had to know.	Yalina okumanya.
But for this we need a plan.	Naye kino twetaaga enteekateeka.
In you you go.	Mu ggwe ogenda.
He was always like that.	Bulijjo yali bw’atyo.
That’s not what we need.	Ekyo si kye twetaaga.
I'm not sure what the reason is.	Sikakasa nsonga ki.
He spoke to me in difficulty.	Yayogera nange mu buzibu.
But mostly he is happy.	Naye okusinga abeera musanyufu.
He says things.	Agamba ebintu.
He had to do it.	Yalina okukikola.
Or he thought he did.	Oba yalowooza nti yakikola.
This is not uniformly the case, of course.	Kino si bwe kiri mu ngeri ya kimu, mazima ddala.
This attitude is almost universal.	Endowooza eno kumpi eri buli wamu.
I'm afraid too.	Nange ntya.
I couldn’t see anyone.	Nnali sisobola kulaba muntu yenna.
Spending time with me.	Okumala nange obudde.
It is not an ideological view.	Si ndowooza ya ndowooza.
Not you, not here, not now.	Si ggwe, si wano, si kati.
However, it is true.	Kyokka, kituufu.
And from the sky.	Era okuva mu bbanga.
I was going to work.	Nnali ngenda ku mulimu.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
It was definitely good.	Mazima ddala kyali kirungi.
Toli soon thought better of it.	Mu bbanga ttono Toli yalowooza bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
Knowing where you are.	Okumanya gy’oli.
. . . .	.
I will probably drive a little.	Oboolyawo nja kuvuga katono.
You have to eat a lot.	Olina okulya ennyo.
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
I am here now.	Nze ndi wano kati.
I am happy to help.	Ndi musanyufu okuyamba.
I was to be on that bus.	Nnali wa kubeera mu bbaasi eyo.
It certainly would be.	Mazima ddala kyandibadde.
He wants to be here and now.	Ayagala kubeera wano ne kati.
I want to be in the here and now.	Njagala kubeera mu wano ne kati.
Now, apparently, you’d like to be alone.	Kati, kirabika, wandyagadde kubeera wekka.
Glad to see you’re doing well.	Musanyufu okulaba nga okola bulungi.
Who knows someone.	Ani amanyi omuntu.
He certainly is.	Mazima ddala y’ali.
There is no time.	Tewali budde.
But maybe there is.	Naye mpozzi nga waliwo.
And, he wanted to be there.	Era, yali ayagala kubeerawo.
I won’t do anything.	Sijja kukola kintu kyonna.
Anyone can see.	Omuntu yenna ayinza okulaba.
He thinks he’s young but he’s not.	Alowooza nti muto naye si bw’atyo.
Probably you too.	Oboolyawo naawe.
And to say nothing.	Era okugamba nti tolina kintu kyonna.
I feel really good.	Nze mpulira bulungi ddala.
I am not sick.	Nze siri mulwadde.
But it’s good this way.	Naye kirungi mu ngeri eno.
It’s not for everyone.	Si ya buli muntu.
No, this will not go away.	Nedda kino tekijja kugenda.
This is absolutely true.	Kino kituufu ddala.
He felt very strong.	Yawulira nga wa maanyi nnyo.
He's like me.	Ye nga nze.
I need help with this.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi ku nsonga eno.
You have to leave the city.	Olina okuva mu kibuga.
He saw the whole thing.	Yalaba ekintu kyonna.
He was doing well.	Yali akola bulungi.
However, in reality this is not always true.	Kyokka, mu butuufu kino si kituufu bulijjo.
I’m really nothing.	Mu butuufu siri kintu kyonna.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo ddala kituufu.
And not everyone can do that.	Era ekyo si buli muntu nti asobola okukikola.
He was her teacher, and always would be.	Yali musomesa we, era bulijjo yandibadde.
Too many nights.	Ekiro bingi nnyo.
He is a good player.	Muzannyi mulungi.
Alone with him.	Yekka naye.
And you’ve been calling every day.	Era obadde okuba essimu buli lunaku.
I was in that thing.	Nze nali mu kintu ekyo.
He was trying too hard.	Yali agezaako nnyo.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
I am not my father.	Si nze taata wange.
You don’t even know they’re there.	Tomanyi na nti bali awo.
I think there’s an opinion.	Ndowooza nti waliwo endowooza.
Someone is talking to me.	Waliwo ayogera nange.
I wanted to be able to play.	Nnali njagala kusobola kuzannya.
Maybe he can help.	Mpozzi asobola okuyamba.
I just want to know about it.	Nze njagala okumanya ku nsonga eyo.
He would be safe.	Yandibadde talina bulabe.
We can’t wait.	Tetusobola kulinda.
And that was good.	Era ekyo kyali kirungi.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange nnyo.
However, only one.	Kyokka, kimu kyokka.
We can’t live without it.	Tetusobola kubeerawo nga tetulina.
But that one did it.	Naye oyo yakikola.
Everything was important.	Buli kimu kyali kikulu.
But nothing comes easy.	Naye tewali kijja kyangu.
I'll be fine.	Nja kuba bulungi.
We can be behind me.	Tusobola okuba emabega wange.
I’ve always loved it.	Bulijjo njagala nnyo.
I was thinking about it.	Nnali ndowooza ku nsonga eyo.
Easy, he thought.	Kyangu, bwe yalowooza.
That’s all there is to it.	Ekyo kyokka kye kiri.
I work hard, there.	Nkola nnyo, eyo.
I am certainly in no hurry to go home.	Mazima ddala siri mu bwangu kudda waka.
He's a nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi.
It seems like it always will.	Kirabika bulijjo kijja kubaawo.
He didn’t tell me anything.	Tewali kye yang’amba.
And this is hard to do.	Era kino kizibu okukola.
Maybe you're on to something here.	Mpozzi oli ku kintu wano.
And every way.	Era buli ngeri.
He always knew that, of course.	Ekyo bulijjo yali akimanyi, ddala.
He's fine.	Ali bulungi.
I said the same thing.	Nange bwe yagamba.
He knows what he has to do.	Amanyi ky’alina okukola.
I don’t know anyone in prison.	Sirina gwe mmanyi mu kkomera.
Do you want to continue?.	Oyagala okugenda mu maaso?.
He can do better than me.	Asobola okukola obulungi okusinga nze.
You are not my problem.	Si ggwe kizibu kyange.
There is no waiting time.	Tewali budde bwa kulinda.
I need to get to something like this.	Nze nneetaaga okutuuka ku kintu nga kino.
You can do it anytime.	Osobola okukikola essaawa yonna.
I feel overwhelmed.	Mpulira nga nfunye ekizibu.
And then they were inside.	Era awo nga bali mu.
He is not happy.	Si musanyufu.
What?.	Kiki?.
He was a very, very human being.	Yali muntu nnyo nnyo.
She wanted to go, she told me.	Yali ayagala kugenda, bwe yang’amba.
We can be those things again.	Tusobola okuddamu okuba ebintu ebyo.
We are there.	Tuli awo.
And that won’t be easy.	Era ekyo tekijja kuba kyangu.
I thought maybe you knew.	Nalowooza nti osanga okimanyi.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
But it’s all we have right now.	Naye byonna bye tulina mu kiseera kino.
I can’t even drive in the city.	Sisobola na kuvuga mu kibuga.
He might be in here already.	Ayinza okuba nga yali mu wano dda.
Not from .	Si okuva .
But he can do it.	Naye asobola okukikola.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
He knew what he wanted to do, too.	Yali amanyi kye yali ayagala okukola, naye.
He looked very happy.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo.
I didn’t know how.	Nze nali simanyi ngeri ki gye nnali nkola.
You're not even here.	Toli wadde wano.
However, I know where we are.	Kyokka, mmanyi gye tuli.
The plan of action.	Enteekateeka y’okukola.
But it’s going to come.	Naye kigenda kujja.
Of course, in that sense.	Kya ddala, mu ngeri eyo.
I have my wife.	Nnina mukyala wange.
It was early.	Yali nga bukyali.
And very beautiful indeed.	Era nga mulungi nnyo ddala.
It’s a simple idea.	Kirowoozo kyangu.
Now it will be my house again.	Kati ejja kuddamu okuba ennyumba yange.
But it’s not realistic.	Naye si kya ddala.
It won’t be very good.	Tekijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
It may be your house but not you.	Kiyinza okuba ennyumba yo naye si ggwe.
But he’s a good player.	Naye muzannyi mulungi.
But it’s hard to say.	Naye kizibu okwogera.
This was actually real.	Kino mu butuufu kyali kya ddala.
Everything is the same at the same time.	Buli kimu kye kimu mu kiseera kye kimu.
Obviously, this is a very bad idea.	Kya lwatu nti kino kirowoozo kibi nnyo.
It was here with you.	Naawe kyali wano.
You can do it right now.	Osobola okukikola mu kiseera kino.
Home at home.	Awaka awaka.
From the bottom.	Okuva wansi.
Not long now.	Si bbanga ddene kati.
This is very important in this process.	Kino kikulu nnyo mu nkola eno.
It seems to actually be the case.	Kirabika mu butuufu bwe kiri.
To anyone .	Eri omuntu yenna .
. . . .	.
And this was very nice of you.	Era kino kyali kirungi nnyo gy’oli.
I was terrified, but hopeful.	Nali ntya nnyo, naye nga nfunye essuubi.
It will stay the same.	Kijja kusigala nga bwe kiri.
This is what I love.	Kino kye njagala nnyo.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
I have it in the car.	Nnina mu mmotoka.
Not on him, obviously.	Si ku ye, kya lwatu.
But there is one problem.	Naye waliwo ekizibu kimu.
But it’s not you.	Naye si ggwe.
He was always the best, the best at everything.	Bulijjo yali asinga, asinga mu buli kimu.
That’s probably why you’re here.	Oboolyawo y’ensonga lwaki oli wano.
Early at the office.	Nga bukyali ku ofiisi.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
That might just be it.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kye kyokka.
Now, on to the .	Kati, okugenda ku .
And they were everywhere.	Era baali buli wamu.
I honestly have no idea.	Mu butuufu sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
We will come to you .	Tujja kujja gy'oli .
I have to do it.	Nnina okukikola.
That he always was.	Nti bulijjo bwe yali.
He has knowledge in everything.	Alina okumanya mu buli kimu.
It was good, very good.	Kyali kirungi, kirungi nnyo.
How lucky we are.	Nga tuli ba mukisa nnyo.
Now I expect nothing from you.	Kati sirina kye nsuubira okuva gy’oli.
I'll just keep praying.	Nja kumala kusigala nga nsaba.
I knew that.	Ebyo nnali mmanyi.
I feel so much better today.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo leero.
At the time he was ill.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali mulwadde.
Not to me.	Si gyendi.
With that, you’re going to do it.	Nga olina ekyo, ogenda kukikola.
I love it and it was great.	Njagala nnyo era kyali kirungi nnyo.
He looks very young.	Alabika muto nnyo.
You do the same thing.	Naawe okola kye kimu.
Everything was fine.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi.
The problem is that .	Obuzibu buli nti .
More than a dog.	Okusinga embwa.
He always seems to want to eat.	Alabika bulijjo ayagala kulya.
I can probably do this.	Kino mpozzi nsobola okukikola.
And you were you.	Era gwe wali ggwe.
We are all vulnerable.	Ffenna tuli mu bulabe.
He had a dog.	Yalina embwa.
Maybe he really did.	Mpozzi ddala yakikola.
I’m absolutely sure about that.	Nze nkakasa ddala ku nsonga eyo.
I was really very sick.	Mazima ddala nnali mulwadde nnyo.
Everyone will play.	Buli omu ajja kuzannya.
I'm not well.	Siri bulungi.
Everyone started talking.	Buli omu yatandika okwogera.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
Or talk to him.	Oba okwogera naye.
Everything seems so complicated.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kizibu nnyo.
From here it was difficult.	Okuva wano kyali kizibu.
It seems like it will happen.	Kirabika kijja kubaawo.
He is so beautiful.	Mulungi bwatyo.
But he knows it won’t.	Naye akimanyi nti tekijja.
You are just a human being.	Oli muntu yekka.
I have nothing to fear.	Nze sirina kye ntya.
But it seemed so long ago.	Naye nga kirabika dda nnyo.
You will go with him.	Ojja kugenda naye.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
That was a bad thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi.
He was in good shape.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi.
We can talk to him in the morning.	Tusobola okwogera naye ku makya.
Now he is sick.	Kati mulwadde.
That was close.	Ekyo kyali kumpi.
I don’t have a classroom position.	Sirina kifo kya kibiina.
He will do it tomorrow.	Ajja kukikola enkya.
Nothing normal there.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo awo.
Surely someone must have known about this.	Mazima ddala waliwo omuntu ateekwa okuba nga yali amanyi ku nsonga eno.
I can talk there.	Nsobola okwogera eyo.
It’s very, very simple.	Kyangu nnyo nnyo.
And it was true.	Era kyali kituufu.
Probably not too dangerous.	Oboolyawo si kya bulabe nnyo.
You said you would.	Wagamba nti ojja kukikola.
This is not the case at all.	Kino si bwe kiri n’akatono.
But he had anything he wanted.	Naye yalina ekintu kyonna kye yali ayagala.
It’s not so easy.	Si kyangu nnyo.
He didn’t have to do that.	Ekyo yali talina kukikola.
But here we both are.	Naye wano ffembi tuli.
That was a good thing.	Ekyo kyali kirungi.
He is a domestic.	Ye muntu wa waka.
No one is speaking.	Tewali ayogera.
It was beautiful and that was it.	Kyali kirungi era ekyo kye kyali.
No one spoke to me.	Tewali yayogera nange.
I guess it would be nice.	Ntebereza nti kyandibadde kirungi.
I want to talk to him now.	Njagala okwogera naye kati.
I may have found it.	Nnyinza okuba nga nfunye.
And quite obviously.	Era nga kya lwatu nnyo.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
I think that will be great.	Ndowooza ekyo kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
He didn’t know how bad it was.	Yali tamanyi ngeri gye kyali kibi.
He went with me.	Yagenda nange.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
I was always afraid.	Bulijjo nnali ntya.
She was beautiful, she thought.	Yali mulungi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
He is my boyfriend.	Ye muganzi wange.
It will be fast.	Kijja kuba kya mangu.
Eating is very difficult.	Okulya kizibu nnyo.
And he knew we couldn’t.	Era yali akimanyi nti tetusobola.
I live comfortably in every place, in any place.	Mbeera bulungi mu buli kifo, mu kifo kyonna.
This was a fact.	Kino kyali kituufu.
Now this is not always an issue.	Kati eno si nsonga bulijjo.
He will say anything.	Ajja kwogera ekintu kyonna.
In fact, it will be very difficult.	Mu butuufu, kijja kuba kizibu nnyo.
I didn’t want to be there.	Nnali saagala kubeerawo.
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
And he is very beautiful.	Era mulungi nnyo.
And now he couldn’t.	Era kati yali tasobola.
Everyone thought he would be fine.	Buli omu yalowooza nti ajja kuba bulungi.
If only we could	Singa tusobola .
No one knows but you.	Tewali amanyi okuggyako ggwe.
You can be too.	Naawe osobola okuba.
I think we can do it.	Ndowooza tusobola okukikola.
He could do this.	Kino yali asobola.
Too much, too quickly.	Bingi nnyo, mu bwangu nnyo.
Not like you.	Si nga ggwe.
But not here, not now.	Naye si wano, si kati.
But, he had to go.	Naye, yalina okugenda.
I'll go back.	Nja kudda emabega.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
The sermon is enough for tonight.	Okubuulira kumala ekiro kino.
I think he actually wants the reason.	Ndowooza mu butuufu ensonga ayagala.
He could barely speak.	Yali asobola bulungi okwogera.
He just does his thing.	Akola kintu kye kyokka.
It was a friendly one.	Kyali kya mukwano.
I should have backed off.	Nnali nsaanidde okudda emabega.
He knew no one in town.	Mu kibuga yali tamanyi muntu yenna.
That he’s going to be fine.	Nti agenda kuba bulungi.
At the time he was a human being.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali muntu.
He has to do it all the time.	Alina okukikola buli kiseera.
Consideration of the .	Okulowooza ku .
Not that that matters.	Si nti ekyo kikulu.
It won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo.
He does that.	Akola bw’atyo.
I'll keep working on this though.	Nja kusigala nga nkola ku nsonga eno wadde.
That’s what it is, of course.	Ekyo kye kiri, ddala.
I love working with him.	Njagala nnyo okukola naye.
He was planning to do it.	Yali ateekateeka okukikola.
Very happy to have you here.	Musanyufu nnyo okubeera naawe wano.
He comes to live with me now.	Ajja okubeera nange kati.
I have to eat well.	Nnina okulya obulungi.
No artist is not like that.	Tewali muyimbi si bw’atyo.
But there was nothing there.	Naye nga tewali kintu kyonna awo.
But it really was.	Naye ddala bwe kyali.
He needs his friends.	Yeetaaga mikwano gye.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
It was plain and simple.	Kyali kya lwatu era nga kyangu.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
This isn’t exactly a bad thing.	Kino si kintu kibi ddala.
But we will do it tonight.	Naye tujja kukikola ekiro kino.
And then, they were together at the time.	Era awo, baali bombi mu kiseera ekyo.
From him.	Okuva ku ye.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
That might work.	Ekyo kiyinza okukola.
I have things to do in a week.	Nnina ebintu bye nkola mu wiiki emu.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
When he came it would be nice.	Bwe yajja kyandibadde kirungi.
He was doing a good job too.	Yali akola omulimu mulungi naye.
There is no one here, he said.	Tewali muntu yenna wano, bwe yagambye.
It was a rough week.	Wiiki eyo yali ya buzibu.
I can’t stay home.	Sisobola kusigala waka.
We need to know.	Tulina okumanya.
He probably needed food.	Oboolyawo yali yeetaaga emmere.
I don’t want to do it either.	Nze nange saagala kukikola.
He lives in us.	Abeera mu ffe.
And it’s easy to do.	Era kyangu okukikola.
It was very, very good.	Kyali kirungi nnyo, kirungi nnyo.
I just wanted something from home.	Nnali njagala kintu kyokka okuva awaka.
But you can do this too.	Naye kino naawe osobola okukikola.
They are on the clock.	Bali ku ssaawa.
And it’s difficult.	Era kizibu.
He said that was unusual.	Yagambye nti ekyo si kya bulijjo.
And they probably are.	Era oboolyawo bwe bali.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
We both need to work.	Ffembi twetaaga okukola.
No it isn’t.	Nedda si ekyo.
That’s a very good thing.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo.
I was really good.	Ddala nnali mulungi.
When he was young.	Bwe yali akyali muto.
And he is a good person.	Era abeera muntu mulungi.
Neither one nor the other.	Tewali omu wadde omulala.
I think we’re fine.	Ndowooza tuli bulungi.
This is a daily thing all the time.	Kino kintu kya buli lunaku buli kiseera.
However, I will be fine.	Kyokka, nja kuba bulungi.
He was going to say something, anything, whatever it was.	Yali agenda kwogera ekintu, kyonna, kyonna kye kyali.
That won’t work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola.
This is very important to me.	Kino kikulu nnyo gyendi.
It was a good thing he did.	Kyali kintu kirungi kye yakola.
In this position.	Mu kifo kino.
It was really fast.	Ddala kyali kya bwangu.
I work from morning till night.	Nkola okuva ku makya okutuuka ekiro.
He felt asleep.	Yawulira nga yeebase.
I just have to do it.	Nze nnina okukikola kyokka.
I don’t really have a problem with him.	Mu butuufu sirina buzibu naye.
He must think.	Ateekwa okulowooza.
But it’s not to be.	Naye si kya kubeera.
He did it anyway.	Yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
You have to assume that this won’t be enough.	Olina okulowooza nti kino tekijja kumala.
Of course no one wanted to.	Kya lwatu tewali yali ayagala.
Someone like him.	Omuntu nga ye.
You are my reason.	Ggwe nsonga yange.
I guess it might work.	Ntebereza nti kiyinza okukola.
Not a very good answer.	Si kya kuddamu kirungi nnyo.
Happy.	Musanyufu.
He was right behind me.	Yali emabega wange ddala.
He is a good father.	Ye taata mulungi.
This is what it was.	Kino kye kyali.
And she looked great.	Era yalabika bulungi nnyo.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
You have to do that.	Ekyo olina okukikola.
Now he knew too.	Kati naye yali amanyi.
Really, it’s not one problem.	Ddala, si kizibu kimu.
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
I want to see better.	Njagala kulaba bulungi.
You will work here.	Ojja kukola wano.
He knew nothing more than I did.	Yali tamanyi kintu kyonna okusinga nze.
Not a huge amount of money! 	Si ssente nnyingi nnyo!
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
No one wants that.	Ekyo tewali ayagala.
But it will work now.	Naye kijja kukola kati.
I love to read.	Njagala nnyo okusoma.
There are so many ways.	Waliwo engeri nnyingi nnyo.
I like to say that.	Njagala nnyo okwogera ekyo.
This is very true, but not entirely true.	Kino kituufu nnyo, naye si kituufu ddala.
But he knew too much.	Naye yali amanyi nnyo.
This was a pivotal moment.	Kino kyali kiseera kikulu nnyo.
And that’s what he thought.	Era ekyo kye yalowooza.
He certainly didn’t know.	Mazima ddala yali tamanyi.
I'm going to move on.	Nze ngenda mu maaso.
He worked hard in school.	Yakola nnyo mu ssomero.
I wanted that one.	Nnali njagala eyo.
I am not sure if this is true.	Sikakasa oba kino kituufu.
That’s what I expect.	Ekyo nsuubira.
Now he knows you’re there.	Kati akimanyi nti oli awo.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
I’m better than him.	Nze asinga we.
He said he would be back soon.	Yagambye nti agenda kudda mu bbanga ttono.
I hope it will be long-term.	Nsuubira nti kijja kuba kya bbanga ddene.
I am happy too.	Nze nange ndi musanyufu.
He seemed too real to be there.	Yalabika nga wa ddala nnyo nga tasobola kubeerawo.
His opinion is true.	Endowooza ye ya mazima.
Meanwhile, here we are at the house.	Mu kiseera kino, wano tuli ku nnyumba.
He couldn’t do this again.	Kino yali tasobola kuddamu kukikola.
But above all he is optimistic.	Naye okusinga byonna alina essuubi.
Of course, that’s not always true.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo si kituufu bulijjo.
What a terrible thing.	Nga kibi nnyo.
He seems to be where he is now.	Alabika awo w’ali kati.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
He went as usual.	Yagenda nga bulijjo.
Indeed, it is very difficult.	Mazima ddala, kizibu nnyo.
This is a problem now.	Kino kizibu kati.
Really, he couldn’t wait.	Ddala, yali tasobola kulinda.
Or that was the plan.	Oba eyo ye yali enteekateeka.
I’m not sure where yet.	Sikakasa wa n’okutuusa kati.
I need help getting home safely.	Nneetaaga obuyambi okutuuka awaka nga sirina bulabe.
He isn’t like that.	Si bw’atyo.
He was ready to go again.	Yali mwetegefu okuddamu okugenda.
Everyone together now.	Buli omu wamu kati.
I wasn’t so sure about anything.	Nnali sikakasa nnyo kintu kyonna.
He didn’t want to do anything again.	Yali tayagala kuddamu kukola kintu kyonna.
And he was .	Era yali .
There is no reason why.	Tewali nsonga lwaki.
This is not an ordinary thing.	Kino si kintu kya bulijjo.
But he needs to get to the hospital.	Naye yeetaaga okutuuka mu ddwaaliro.
Not very well, but he could.	Si bulungi nnyo, naye yali asobola.
And not knowing this situation.	Era si kumanya mbeera eno.
But this book is awful.	Naye ekitabo kino kibi nnyo.
And he could do it.	Era yali asobola okukikola.
He is doing well at school.	Akola bulungi ku ssomero.
It’s the same as everyone else.	Kye kimu nga buli muntu.
Goodness, he tried.	Obulungi, bwe yagezaako.
In this it was alone.	Mu kino kyali kyokka.
Please about that.	Nsaba ku nsonga eyo.
I don’t think so, by any means.	Sirowooza, mu ngeri yonna.
He has no idea.	Talina kirowoozo kyonna.
. . . .	.
Not a problem, apparently.	Si kizibu, kirabika.
Maybe now is the time.	Mpozzi kati kye kiseera.
Apparently that wasn’t the case.	Kirabika ekyo si bwe kyali.
I hope it’s true though.	Nsuubira nti kituufu wadde.
We will, we can, we must.	Tujja, tusobola, tulina.
It was all he could do at the time.	Kye kyokka kye yali asobola okukola mu kiseera ekyo.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
There is, always.	Waliwo, bulijjo.
She loved the home.	Yali ayagala nnyo awaka.
She was in better shape than she feared.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi okusinga bwe yali atya.
That was always great.	Ekyo bulijjo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I wish someone would do that.	Njagala nnyo omuntu akole ekyo.
And he was way behind.	Era yali emabega nnyo.
It’s not exactly true.	Si kituufu ddala.
Now this is what we have.	Kati kino kye tulina.
I don’t want to be here.	Saagala kubeera wano.
What a difficult thing.	Nga kizibu nnyo.
He got busy.	Yafuna bbize.
He did, but reluctantly.	Yakikola, naye nga tayagala.
But there isn’t much time.	Naye tewali budde bungi.
But that’s just not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
I want you still.	Njagala ggwe n’okutuusa kati.
And it was an important move.	Era kyali kikulu kye yakola.
Nobody but you, you know.	Tewali muntu yenna okuggyako ggwe, okimanyi.
We have the money to do it.	Tulina ssente okukikola.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
But he had a chance to think.	Naye yafuna omukisa okulowooza.
In any case.	Mu mbeera yonna.
I love that he said that though.	Njagala nnyo nti yayogera bw’atyo wadde.
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
But he is also very good.	Naye naye nga mulungi nnyo.
Maybe you don’t want to talk.	Mpozzi nga toyagala kwogera.
I’ve always had it.	Nze bulijjo mbadde nfunye.
It will work fine.	Kijja kukola bulungi.
He loves everyone.	Ayagala nnyo buli muntu.
I want to be my own thing.	Njagala kubeera kintu kyange.
The image was powerful.	Ekifaananyi kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
It doesn’t really matter which.	Mu butuufu si kikulu ki.
It’s not anything .	Si kintu kyonna .
I'm not sure as well.	Sikakasa nga bwe kiri.
But of course no one can say why.	Naye ddala tewali ayinza kwogera lwaki.
Now, we were really alone.	Kati, ddala twali ffekka.
Not only that.	Si kyokka nti...
I hope you can help.	Nsuubira nti osobola okuyamba.
A very nice person.	Omuntu omulungi ennyo.
We are very close friends.	Tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
Everyone here knows it.	Buli muntu wano akimanyi.
It seems so simple, easy, and simple.	Kirabika kyangu nnyo, kyangu, era kyangu.
This will not work.	Kino tekijja kukola.
He is a blessing.	Ye mukisa.
I wanted to know why.	Nnali njagala okumanya lwaki.
We are fortunate to have him in that regard.	Tulina omukisa okubeera naye mu nsonga eyo.
But as it was .	Naye nga bwe kyali .
This was such a time.	Kino kyali kiseera ng’ekyo.
That was the beauty of the plan.	Ekyo kye kyali obulungi enteekateeka eyo.
He was going to.	Yali agenda.
I feel better every day.	Mpulira bulungi buli lunaku.
I have to work, too.	Nange nnina okukola.
But he is happy too.	Naye naye musanyufu.
However, there is no point.	Kyokka, tewali nsonga yonna eri ku nsonga.
It was really him.	Ddala yali ye.
I think that’s a dangerous place to be.	Ndowooza ekyo kifo kya bulabe okubeera.
I love this movie.	Njagala nnyo firimu eno.
He hardly had time for anyone.	Yali talina nnyo budde bwa muntu yenna.
Here he is.	Wano w’ali.
This was practical.	Kino kyali kya nkola.
It’s important that you know it.	Kikulu nti okimanyi.
But that would be terrible.	Naye ekyo kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
Really good work there.	Ddala omulimu mulungi eyo.
I didn’t know if it would work.	Nnali simanyi oba yandikoze.
This would be what he was doing.	Kino kyandibadde kye yali akola.
In practice, it is not.	Mu nkola, si bwe kiri.
It was actually a good time.	Mu butuufu kyali kiseera kirungi.
He knows he is safe.	Akimanyi nti talina bulabe.
This is a quick one.	Kino kya bwangu.
I’m happy with it.	Nze ndi musanyufu.
He wanted things.	Yali ayagala ebintu.
Nothing mattered here.	Wano tewali kyali kikulu.
He needed to know.	Yali yeetaaga okumanya.
This is the whole problem.	Kino kye kizibu kyonna.
I have experienced something like this so far.	Nfunye ekintu nga kino okutuusa kati.
He had no policy.	Yali talina nkola yonna.
There is no one way.	Tewali ngeri emu.
This he knew all too well.	Kino kye yali amanyi bulungi nnyo.
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
That looks pretty good.	Ekyo kirabika bulungi nnyo.
And the guys.	Ne ba ggaayi.
There isn’t anything at all.	Tewali n’akatono.
This is my point.	Eno y’ensonga yange.
Whether he wanted to or not.	Oba yali ayagala oba nedda.
But it doesn’t seem to be.	Naye kirabika si bwe kiri.
Very very very very.	Ennyo nnyo nnyo.
You go on and on.	Ogenda mu maaso ogenda mu maaso.
But it actually is.	Naye mu butuufu bwe kiri.
No one is faster, either.	Tewali muntu asinga ku bwangu, era.
That’s not the same thing.	Ekyo si kye kimu.
A week, maybe early.	Wiiki emu, mpozzi nga bukyali.
We are very close friends.	Tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
It’s the job.	Gwe mulimu.
This is going to be difficult.	Kino kigenda kuba kizibu.
That’s nothing to me.	Ekyo si kintu gyendi.
I think it’s a good point for us.	Ndowooza nsonga nnungi gye tuli.
But no, we can’t stay.	Naye nedda, tetusobola kusigala.
This is very close.	Kino kiri kumpi nnyo.
I love everybody.	Njagala nnyo buli muntu.
I live in .	Nze mbeera .
This is not quite true.	Kino si kituufu nnyo.
It’s hard to be both.	Kizibu okubeera bombi.
Maybe he doesn’t have one.	Mpozzi nga talina.
It’s really easy.	Kyangu ddala.
No one had any idea.	Tewali yalina kirowoozo kyonna.
That was fine, except for one thing.	Ekyo kyali kirungi, okuggyako ekintu kimu.
And he was homesick.	Era yali ayagala nnyo awaka.
A nice guy.	Ggaayi omulungi.
There seems to be something to this though.	Kirabika waliwo ekintu ku nsonga eno wadde.
When he was young.	Nga akyali muto.
You are real.	Oli wa ddala.
And money is a thing.	Era ssente kintu.
Not very happy with you.	Si musanyufu nnyo naawe.
It will always get better.	Bulijjo kijja kufuna obulungi.
I am not sure about myself.	Sikakasa ku nze kennyini.
You’re not, actually.	Ggwe toli, mu butuufu.
For my boyfriend.	Ku lwa muganzi wange.
The moment itself.	Akaseera kennyini.
I have the same problem.	Nze nnina ekizibu kye kimu.
I have no opinion on him.	Sirina ndowooza yonna ku ye.
And he loves everyone.	Era ayagala nnyo buli muntu.
He thinks he knows everything.	Alowooza nti buli kimu akimanyi.
This thing will not keep going.	Ekintu kino tekijja kusigala nga kigenda mu maaso.
It was actually going to happen.	Mu butuufu kyali kigenda kubaawo.
And, yes, it’s great.	Era, ye, kirungi nnyo.
He doesn’t need too much.	Teyeetaaga bingi nnyo.
This is normal.	Kino kya bulijjo.
It is obviously very simple.	Kya lwatu nti kyangu nnyo.
Very nice house.	Ennyumba nnungi nnyo.
I think he does.	Ndowooza akola.
This is hard to see the whole picture.	Kino kizibu okulaba ekifaananyi kyonna.
It’s not hard to see why this might be the case.	Si kizibu kulaba lwaki kino kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
He wasn’t supposed to be there.	Yali talina kubeerawo.
You know better than this.	Ggwe omanyi okusinga kino.
I didn’t know what he wanted.	Nnali simanyi kye yali ayagala.
It's bad for you.	Kibi gyoli.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
But he needs money.	Naye yeetaaga ssente.
Now I’m not going.	Kati sigenda.
Of course, we will do that.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo tujja kukikola.
He is really good to me.	Ye ddala mulungi gyendi.
No time for nice talk.	Tewali budde bwa kwogera bulungi.
I'm not here to make trouble.	Siri wano kukola buzibu.
You will	Ojja .
I was thinking about something yesterday.	Nali ndowooza ku kintu eggulo.
It’s really really hard.	Ddala ddala kizibu nnyo.
It was that or getting to him.	Kyali ekyo oba okutuuka ku ye.
We’re really good friends.	Ddala tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
I thought it might help.	Nnalowooza nti kiyinza okuyamba.
Too bad about that, really.	Kibi nnyo ku ekyo, ddala.
And my brother knew it.	Era muganda wange yali akimanyi.
He is very beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo.
He was sick about it, actually.	Yali mulwadde ku nsonga eyo, mu butuufu.
No man spoke.	Tewali musajja yayogera.
I just wanted to say that.	Ekyo nnali njagala kwogera kyokka.
You’ve always been good to us.	Bulijjo obadde mulungi gye tuli.
This is a terrible thing.	Kino kibi nnyo.
I expected the same.	Nali nsuubira kye kimu.
You can speak below.	Osobola okwogera wansi.
We’ll work together in the morning.	Tujja kukola ffembi ku makya.
I feel sick thinking about it.	Mpulira nga ndi mulwadde nga ndowooza ku nsonga eyo.
It was a little awkward.	Kyali kizibu katono.
But there was a problem.	Naye nga waliwo ekizibu.
But you’re coming.	Naye ggwe ojja.
Now he loves it.	Kati ayagala nnyo.
Everything is fine now.	Buli kimu kirungi kati.
He may be the one.	Ayinza okuba nga ye.
I work at the time.	Nze nkola mu kiseera ekyo.
We’re all going to a party.	Ffenna tugenda ku kabaga.
He was just the best.	Yali asinga obulungi yekka.
No one lives there now.	Tewali abeera eyo kati.
Very fast delivery.	Okutuusa amangu nnyo.
I won’t tell anyone about it in the evening.	Sijja kubuulira muntu yenna ku nsonga eno akawungeezi.
But now he had one.	Naye kati yalina emu.
That’s the place.	Ekyo kye kifo.
As much as he could be.	Nga bwe yali asobola okuba.
Or closer to home.	Oba kumpi awaka.
But in this case, he could.	Naye mu kino, yali asobola.
He was always .	Bulijjo yali .
That can only be a problem.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu kyokka.
Like his brother.	Nga muganda we.
It’s not helpful.	Si kuyamba.
The food was excellent.	Emmere eyo yali nnungi nnyo.
It doesn’t really matter right now.	Si kikulu nnyo mu kiseera kino.
I had no idea.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
Maybe they were, at that.	Mpozzi baali, ku ekyo.
I think someone is in the house.	Ndowooza muntu ali mu nnyumba.
You will do it.	Ojja kukikola.
I always wanted to eat one.	Bulijjo nnali njagala okulya emu.
Or in the same.	Oba mu kimu.
He wants his money.	Ayagala ssente ze.
Or he does that.	Oba akola bw’atyo.
You really really can’t.	Ddala ddala tosobola.
A lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi.
It’s hard to win.	Kizibu okuwangula.
But not for long .	Naye si lwa bbanga ddene .
And that’s absolutely fine.	Era ekyo kirungi ddala.
No, he couldn’t do that.	Nedda, ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
That is more important than going to jail.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo okusinga okugenda mu kkomera.
And I was afraid.	Era nnali ntya.
Apparently it was pretty good.	Kirabika kyali kirungi nnyo.
We don’t have time.	Tetulina budde.
It will never be the same again.	Tekijja kuddamu kubeera nga bwe kyali.
In many ways this is unusual.	Mu ngeri nnyingi kino si kintu kya bulijjo.
Maybe he wanted too much too soon.	Mpozzi yali ayagala nnyo nnyo mangu nnyo.
But he is something to you.	Naye ye kintu gy’oli.
I know where everything is though.	Nze mmanyi buli kimu we kiri wadde.
Both of them.	Bombi bombi.
Happy.	Musanyufu.
That’s going to happen.	Ekyo kigenda kubaawo.
It doesn’t matter what you want.	Si kikulu ky’oyagala.
No one has an issue.	Tewali muntu yenna alina nsonga.
He is my brother.	Ye muganda wange.
But he had been lucky.	Naye yali abadde wa mukisa.
Why, no .	Lwaki, nedda .
Maybe we’ll buy a house.	Mpozzi tujja kugula ennyumba.
Anyone can do this.	Kino omuntu yenna asobola okukikola.
It absolutely had to happen.	Kyalina okubaawo ddala.
It’s easy for you to talk.	Kyangu gyoli okwogera.
Nothing comes easy for either side.	Tewali kijja kyangu eri buli ludda.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He was beautiful.	Yali mulungi.
What could it be? 	Kiyinza okuba nga ki?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
No one would be.	Tewali yandibadde.
It was very important to us.	Kyali kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
I wonder why he is here.	Nze nneebuuza lwaki ali wano.
And someone is working with him.	Era waliwo akola naye.
He wasn’t himself.	Ye yali si ye kennyini.
But, what's the problem.	Naye, kiki ekizibu.
And you don’t have to say anything.	Era tolina kwogera kintu kyonna.
That's the only problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyokka.
I want to see him do really well.	Njagala okulaba ng’akola bulungi ddala.
You won’t be in here long.	Tojja kubeera mu wano bbanga ddene.
My dad will be here soon.	Taata wange ajja kubeera wano mu bbanga ttono.
He wanted to do it.	Yali ayagala kukikola.
That’s all they are.	Ekyo kyokka kye bali.
I’m not really a party person.	Mu butuufu siri muntu wa kibiina.
I couldn’t say why, really.	Nnali sisobola kwogera lwaki, ddala.
Whoever is behind this knows that too.	Oyo yenna ali emabega wa kino naye ekyo akimanyi.
She is really very good.	Ye ddala mulungi nnyo.
All that we can do.	Byonna bye tusobola okukola.
And he can get lucky.	Era asobola okufuna omukisa.
He came right to me.	Yajja ddala gyendi.
But no one knew where he was.	Naye tewali yali amanyi gye yali.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
He does a really good job.	Akola omulimu mulungi ddala.
That is very fortunate for us.	Ekyo kya mukisa nnyo gye tuli.
He had me .	Yalina nze .
We’re all best friends.	Ffenna tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
He didn’t think he was good at anything.	Yali talowooza nti yali mulungi mu kintu kyonna.
It’s not true at all.	Si kituufu n’akatono.
Maybe that’s true.	Mpozzi ekyo kituufu.
And yet .	Era naye .
It was very dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
You could have done whatever you wanted.	Wandibadde okola kyonna ky’oyagala.
It’s probably in his office.	Oboolyawo kiri mu ofiisi ye.
I don't know exactly.	Nze simanyi bulungi.
It’s really easy to do this.	Ddala kyangu okukola kino.
However, it is not him.	Kyokka si ye.
This was very important for us.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
It is a very good idea.	Kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
It was dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe.
This does not seem to be the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
I'm going to drive.	Ngenda kuvuga.
It was practical.	Kyali kya nkola.
He has to know that you have.	Alina okumanya nti olina.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
This was a great place.	Kino kyali kifo kikulu nnyo.
I’ll see what I can do.	Nja kulaba kye nsobola okukola.
That’s what he did.	Bw’atyo bwe yakola.
This is what he expected.	Kino kye yali asuubira.
It was really beautiful.	Ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
Together in the same place and at the same time.	Nga tuli wamu mu kifo kimu era mu kiseera kimu.
She was very beautiful.	Yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
We’ll do that now.	Ekyo tujja kukikola kati.
This is dangerous.	Kino kya bulabe.
He knew that from the movies.	Ekyo yali akimanyi okuva mu firimu.
But he could talk.	Naye yali asobola okwogera.
He will be very happy.	Ajja kuba musanyufu nnyo.
There's a phone.	Waliwo essimu.
I wasn’t sure what he would do.	Nnali sikakasa kye yandikoze.
That’s not the case in this film.	Ekyo si bwe kiri mu firimu eno.
I love to swim.	Njagala nnyo okuwuga.
He couldn't do it, he couldn't do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola, yali tasobola kukikola.
And you have to.	Era olina.
He was not his usual self.	Si ye yali omuntu we wa bulijjo.
That’s where we have it.	Eyo gye tulina.
He should have known something like this was going to happen.	Yandibadde amanyi ekintu nga kino ekigenda okubaawo.
. . . .	.
And this seems to be the case.	Era kino kirabika bwe kiri.
In that case,	Mu mbeera eyo, .
But you have a point.	Naye olina ensonga.
It can be so many things.	Kiyinza okuba ebintu bingi nnyo.
Really good work.	Ddala omulimu mulungi.
We are all here to help.	Ffenna tuli wano okuyamba.
He is a strong man.	Ye musajja wa maanyi.
He should have known.	Yandibadde amanyi.
On time as usual.	Mu budde nga bulijjo.
I expect so much more.	Nze nsuubira bingi nnyo.
I'm sorry, baby.	Nsonyiwa mwana.
I want to be gay.	Njagala kubeera muganzi.
No, it’s fine.	Nedda, kirungi.
It’s not me.	Si nze.
He wants to talk to you.	Ayagala okwogera naawe.
I want to talk to him again.	Njagala okuddamu okwogera naye.
It was really a dangerous time.	Ddala kyali kiseera kya bulabe.
Everything mostly looks good.	Buli kimu okusinga kirabika bulungi.
I want to come with you.	Njagala kujja naawe.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
That’s all he did.	Ekyo kyokka kye yakola.
You know he loves it.	Omanyi ayagala nnyo.
However, this was certainly not the case.	Kyokka, mazima ddala kino si kye kyali.
I’m from here.	Nze ndi wa wano.
One should, anyway.	Omuntu yandibadde, mu ngeri yonna.
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
Something is nearby.	Ekintu kiri kumpi.
But he knew he was good in trouble.	Naye yali akimanyi nti yali mulungi mu buzibu.
And they still are.	Era n’okutuusa kati bwe bali.
It’s not a good feeling.	Si mpulira nnungi.
He speaks quickly.	Ayogera mangu.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
He felt better now.	Yawulira bulungi kati.
He did well, and that was good.	Yakola bulungi era ekyo kyali kirungi.
Now that’s not unusual at all.	Kati ekyo si kya bulijjo n’akatono.
Not like yesterday.	Si nga jjo.
I wonder why?.	Nze nneebuuza lwaki?.
We'll talk again soon.	Tujja kuddamu okwogera mu bbanga ttono.
That? 	Ekyo?
No, it really isn’t.	Nedda, ddala si bwe kiri.
It doesn't really matter who and.	Si kikulu nnyo ani ne.
It may not be acting.	Kiyinza okuba nga si kuzannya.
No one lives there.	Tewali abeera eyo.
This is not easy to do.	Kino si kyangu kukikola.
This doesn’t really matter to you.	Kino si kikulu nnyo gy’oli.
He had no ill will.	Yali talina ky’ayagala kibi.
You don’t have to talk to us.	Tolina kwogera naffe.
It’s not an opinion.	Si ndowooza.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange asinga.
This was really and truly happening.	Kino kyali kigenda mu maaso ddala era mu butuufu.
I’m a singer.	Nze ndi muyimbi.
Most likely in this case he will agree.	Okusinga mu mbeera eno ajja kukkiriza.
It was probably a good thing.	Oboolyawo kyali kintu kirungi.
But he knew he couldn't.	Naye yali akimanyi nti tasobola.
I know how they are.	Nze mmanyi bwe bali.
I don’t think this will happen any time soon.	Sirowooza nti kino kijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono.
You can talk to him.	Oyinza okwogera naye.
I am down with this.	Nze ndi wansi ne kino.
It’s the same as it always was.	Kye kimu nga bwe kyali bulijjo.
Nothing serious.	Tewali kintu kya maanyi.
No one knew that better than he did.	Ekyo tewali yali akimanyi okusinga ye.
I just couldn’t.	Nze nnali sisobola kyokka.
He has the power.	Alina amaanyi.
This seems very difficult.	Kino kirabika nga kizibu nnyo.
It was a situation.	Yali mbeera.
Which he really wanted.	Kye yali ayagala ennyo.
Not under any circumstances.	Si mu mbeera yonna.
There is a problem with that.	Waliwo obuzibu ku ekyo.
No, please don't.	Nedda, nsaba nedda.
He was the best.	Ye yali asinga obulungi.
For me, this is very difficult.	Nze kino kizibu nnyo.
But it was there.	Naye kyali awo.
I was a very good teacher.	Nnali musomesa mulungi nnyo.
I wanted his blessing.	Nnali njagala omukisa gwe.
It’s close.	Kiri kumpi.
He was a person like me.	Yali muntu nga nze.
This is a dangerous thing.	Kino kintu kya bulabe.
But this is not a common problem.	Naye kino si kizibu kya bulijjo.
You’re just there.	Oli awo kyokka.
As in together.	Nga mu wamu.
But it is very difficult.	Naye kizibu nnyo.
He was going to.	Yali agenda.
None of this was real.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kyali kya ddala.
Not bad, at all.	Si kibi, n’akatono.
He is a class organization.	Ye kibiina kya kibiina.
Not at work, not at home.	Si ku mulimu, si waka.
You are the truth.	Ggwe mazima.
I think that’s really it.	Ndowooza ekyo ddala kye kiri.
It doesn’t come right.	Tekijja bulungi.
And he said, It is good.	N'agamba nti, kirungi.
He was her friend.	Yali mukwano gwe.
He may well win, of course.	Ayinza bulungi okuwangula, ddala.
You can buy who and what you want.	Osobola okugula ani ne kiki ky’oyagala.
You really won’t be without her.	Mu butuufu tojja kuba nga tolina ye.
Everybody knows it, everybody.	Buli omu akimanyi, buli muntu.
What his plan was.	Enteekateeka ye kye yali.
I won’t know until today.	Sijja kumanya n’okutuusa leero.
He knew it well enough.	Yali akimanyi bulungi.
No one talks much.	Tewali ayogera nnyo.
He obviously doesn’t know where he went.	Kya lwatu nti tamanyi gye yagenda.
I'm fine, really.	Ndi bulungi, ddala.
She was very beautiful.	Yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
And certainly not in the city.	Era mazima si mu kibuga.
I've been thinking about it.	Mbadde ndowooza ku nsonga eyo.
More than they are today.	Okusinga bwe bali leero.
Maybe a movie.	Mpozzi firimu.
I will help too.	Nange nja kuyamba.
For a moment he was happy.	Okumala akaseera katono yali musanyufu.
What's up everyone.	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso buli muntu.
He can’t do it alone.	Tasobola kukikola yekka.
No time to do anything about it.	Tewali budde bwa kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
Something he loves.	Ekintu ky’ayagala ennyo.
I have done nothing wrong.	Sirina kibi kye nkola.
At the moment it is not.	Mu kiseera kino si bwe kiri.
What the hell, he thought.	Kiki ekizibu, bwe yalowooza.
I’m the front-runner.	Nze ndi wa maaso.
But it went on and on.	Naye ne kugenda mu maaso ne kugenda.
Why not, of course.	Lwaki nedda, ddala.
It was a really great idea.	Ddala kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I want your opinion on one.	Njagala endowooza yo ku emu.
I think back now and wonder why.	Ndowooza emabega kati ne nneebuuza lwaki.
This is where the problem lies.	Wano we wali obuzibu.
He could have been anyone.	Yali asobola okuba omuntu yenna.
He loves to help.	Ayagala nnyo okuyamba.
I feel pretty good, actually.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
It can be very effective.	Kiyinza okukola ennyo.
I’m sure he’s pretty good at it.	Nkakasa nti mulungi nnyo mu nsonga eyo.
And that’s just not true.	Era ekyo kyokka si kituufu.
Exactly like him.	Ddala nga ye.
I’m not sure you will.	Sikakasa nti ojja kukikola.
He was a good friend and a good doctor.	Yali mukwano gwange mulungi era nga musawo mulungi.
I didn’t want to talk.	Nnali saagala kwogera.
As it always is.	Nga bwe kiri bulijjo.
He came to me.	Yajja gye ndi.
He made a good friend.	Yakola mukwano gwe ennyo.
Every morning is just the same.	Buli ku makya kye kimu kyokka.
He wanted to go to work.	Yali ayagala kugenda ku mulimu.
You will know why.	Ojja kumanya lwaki.
23 hours a day.	Ssaawa 23 olunaku.
He is always well.	Bulijjo abeera bulungi.
No one is going to do that.	Ekyo tewali agenda kukikola.
I want to be on this .	Njagala kubeera ku kino .
Obviously they are.	Kya lwatu nti bwe bali.
Maybe you should and maybe not.	Mpozzi wandibadde olina era mpozzi nedda.
He doesn’t think before he acts.	Talowooza nga tannaba kukola kintu kyonna.
It’s not long-term.	Si kya bbanga ddene.
It’s not always easy.	Si kyangu bulijjo.
I need it so much.	Nze nneetaaga nnyo.
I don’t have anyone right now.	Sirina muntu yenna mu kiseera kino.
That was coming, he knew.	Ekyo kyali kijja, yali akimanyi.
They are in school.	Bali mu ssomero.
He was lying there.	Yali yeebase awo.
not too much yet.	si bingi nnyo n’okutuusa kati.
No real problems.	Tewali buzibu bwa ddala.
This is a powerful thing.	Kino kintu kya maanyi.
He needed to be like that.	Yali yeetaaga okuba bw’atyo.
No one could harm my father.	Tewali yali asobola kukola bulabe ku taata.
Speaking is good.	Okwogera kirungi.
No problems with performance.	Tewali buzibu ku kukola.
This is critical going forward.	Kino kikulu nnyo okugenda mu maaso.
I love being with you.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe.
It doesn’t really matter.	Mu butuufu si kikulu.
Anyone can help.	Omuntu yenna asobola okuyamba.
I have a lot of money.	Nnina ssente nnyingi.
Not as good as a car.	Si kirungi nga mmotoka.
Like, really early.	Nga, ddala nga bukyali.
That was all he needed.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali yeetaaga.
He could have said that.	Ekyo yandibadde asobola okwogera.
He came so close.	Yajja nnyo kumpi nnyo.
It’s hard to find reasons.	Kizibu okufuna ensonga.
No one knew what he wanted to do.	Tewali yali amanyi kye yali ayagala kukola.
This will help back up.	Kino kijja kuyamba okudda emabega.
Does anyone know what it is?.	Waliwo amanyi kye ki?.
The food is very good.	Emmere eyo nnungi nnyo.
He couldn’t let that happen.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
He had slept through the night.	Yali yeebase ekiro kyonna.
They were a force.	Baali maanyi.
We’re going to come back here.	Tugenda kudda wano.
That very well could happen.	Ekyo bulungi nnyo kiyinza okubaawo.
It won’t be enough.	Tekijja kumala.
He wanted to play.	Yali ayagala kuzannya.
He is in all of us.	Ali mu ffe ffenna.
But man is alone.	Naye omuntu ali yekka.
And he needs to win.	Era yeetaaga okuwangula.
And it’s not like that at all.	Era si bwe kiri n’akatono.
No why, no how.	Tewali lwaki, tewali ngeri ki.
He can get a book.	Asobola okufuna ekitabo.
She looks great today.	Alabika bulungi nnyo leero.
Not until he.	Si okutuusa lwe.
He knew you were in trouble.	Yali akimanyi nti oli mu buzibu.
No, what kind.	Nedda ngeri ki.
In reality, however, it is not.	Kyokka mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
He didn’t like it very much.	Yali tayagala nnyo.
You’re going to be a doctor.	Ogenda kubeera musawo.
He was a poet.	Yali muyimbi.
He is the only one who can speak.	Ye yekka asobola okwogera.
He is very good and a very good singer.	Mulungi nnyo era muyimbi mulungi nnyo.
He said he was fine.	Yagambye nti ali bulungi.
And he couldn’t just work either.	Era naye yali tasobola kumala kukola.
That I was good at that, you know.	Ekyo nnali mulungi mu ekyo, omanyi.
He always does this.	Kino bulijjo akikola.
I can be myself.	Nsobola okuba nze kennyini.
You have been good to me.	Obadde mulungi gyendi.
And neither will you.	Era naawe tojja kukikola.
. . . .	.
A very nice guy.	Ggaayi omulungi ennyo.
Someone will be with you soon.	Waliwo ajja kuba naawe mu bbanga ttono.
This is the only reality.	Kino kyokka kye kya ddala.
It is just that .	Kye kimu nti .
I won’t do that right now.	Ekyo sijja kukikola mu kiseera kino.
Which we can do.	Kye tusobola okukola.
He says that he does.	Agamba nti akola bw’atyo.
There is no harm .	Tewali bulabe bwonna .
I think it will happen.	Ndowooza kijja kubaawo.
He thought maybe he could be that person .	Yalowooza nti osanga asobola okuba omuntu oyo .
He didn’t want to play.	Yali tayagala kuzannya.
Surely who he was.	Mazima ddala yali ani.
You just don’t know that you know it.	Ggwe kyokka tomanyi nti okimanyi.
You’re sick.	Oli mulwadde.
It was always very simple.	Bulijjo kyali kyangu nnyo.
This seems to be going well.	Kino kirabika kigenda bulungi.
He prepares another.	Ateekateeka omulala.
Here he worked hard.	Wano yakola nnyo.
This was one thing.	Kino kyali kimu.
You almost were.	Ggwe kumpi wali.
You are a lucky man my friend.	Oli musajja wa mukisa mukwano gwange.
It was just really bad.	Kyali kibi ddala kyokka.
Maybe he'd rather not.	Mpozzi yandibadde asinga obutakola.
However, it can be anything you want.	Kyokka, kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala.
Not long though.	Si bbanga ddene wadde.
I hope you will try it.	Nsuubira nti ojja kugezaako.
You won’t do it.	Tojja kukikola.
She looked so beautiful and so happy.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo era nga musanyufu nnyo.
This is the only thing.	Kino kye kintu kyokka.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
I couldn’t go home.	Nnali sisobola kudda waka.
I’m an ordinary guy.	Nze ndi ggaayi wa bulijjo.
We have no plans.	Tetulina nteekateeka.
No one could really say.	Tewali yali asobola kwogera mu butuufu.
Without the same.	Nga tewali kye kimu.
For what, it's hard to say.	Ku lwa ki, kizibu okwogera.
He was very friendly, always was.	Yali wa mukwano nnyo, bulijjo bw’atyo.
He should have known where he was.	Yandibadde amanyi gye yali.
This is his thing and he really wants to do it.	Kino kintu kye era ddala ayagala kukikola.
But he is not well.	Naye tali bulungi.
How beautiful it is.	Nga bulungi nnyo.
It’s a real issue for me.	Ensonga ya ddala gyendi.
The same would apply here.	Ekintu kye kimu kyandibadde ne wano.
We were here.	Twali wano.
But he was young.	Naye yali muto.
And this is not true.	Era kino si kituufu.
Maybe he’s in the hospital.	Mpozzi ali mu ddwaaliro.
He didn’t want to be alone.	Yali tayagala kubeera yekka.
But with us.	Naye nga tuli naffe.
Anything and everything.	Ekintu kyonna na buli kimu.
I will find another job.	Nja kufuna omulimu omulala.
But he was just a really nice guy.	Naye yali ggaayi mulungi ddala yekka.
We can always do better.	Bulijjo tusobola okukola obulungi.
I’m afraid you won’t want to come here again.	Ntya nti tojja kuddamu kwagala kujja wano.
that's what it is.	ekyo kye kiri.
But he’s like that.	Naye bw’atyo.
I'm not sure what the problem is though.	Sikakasa buzibu ki wadde.
There is nothing to say.	Tewali kya kwogera.
I think you’ll know.	Ndowooza ojja kumanya.
Do you know why this is happening?.	Omanyi lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso?.
All he wanted to do.	Byonna bye yali ayagala okukola.
This is not always the case.	Kino si bwe kiri bulijjo.
I'll just finish here.	Nja kumala wano.
He said something about .	Yayogera ekintu ku .
This was a fact.	Kino kyali kituufu.
Like always.	Nga buli kiseera.
I can’t wait!!.	Siyinza kulinda!!.
It’s just the same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu kyokka.
Having a father like that .	Okubeera ne taata nga oyo .
In so many ways.	Mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo.
It is very simple and easy.	Kyangu nnyo era kyangu.
He would have to go on alone.	Yandibadde alina okugenda mu maaso yekka.
As it was supposed to be.	Nga bwe kyalina okuba.
There is nothing at all.	Tewali kintu na kimu.
It will be fine at this point.	Kijja kuba kirungi mu kiseera kino.
This doesn’t seem easy.	Kino kirabika si kyangu.
And that may have been the problem.	Era ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kye kyali ekizibu.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
I really, really do.	Nze ddala, ddala nkola.
I just wanted to be normal.	Nnali njagala kubeera wa bulijjo kyokka.
I can’t manage to do it.	Sisobola kusobola kukikola.
He tried to speak.	Yagezaako okwogera.
You have this problem with movies.	Olina ekizibu kino ku firimu.
This is going to be very powerful.	Kino kigenda kuba kya maanyi nnyo.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
What a thing to do baby.	Nga kintu kya kukola mwana.
He knows.	Amanyi.
It was curiosity.	Kyali kwagala kumanya.
And that's just not like me.	Era ekyo kyokka si nga nze.
He didn’t do anything.	Tewali kye yakola.
I could only think of him.	Nnali nsobola okulowooza ku ye yekka.
That’s right, nothing.	Ekyo kituufu, tewali kintu kyonna.
I think visually.	Ndowooza mu kulaba.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali.
You are lucky.	Oli mukisa.
He was very curious.	Yali ayagala nnyo okumanya.
We cannot accept this fact.	Tetusobola kukkiriza nsonga eno.
How simple and easy everything was then.	Nga buli kimu kyali kyangu era nga kyangu mu kiseera ekyo.
Maybe he could, at that.	Mpozzi yali asobola, ku ekyo.
But he is beautiful.	Naye ye mulungi.
Maybe you shouldn’t either.	Mpozzi naawe tolina kukikola.
No one is in sight.	Tewali muntu yenna alabika.
I am a school teacher.	Ndi musomesa wa ssomero.
He made money.	Yakola ssente.
The best is the youngest.	Asinga obulungi ye muto muto.
I want you, and you alone.	Njagala ggwe, era ggwe wekka.
All the time, everywhere.	Buli kiseera, buli wamu.
This is unusual for me.	Kino si kya bulijjo gyendi.
I’ve always known it, and now you know it.	Bulijjo nkimanyi, era kati naawe okimanyi.
I love the food.	Njagala nnyo emmere.
It was a good move.	Yali nkola nnungi.
I think we should do it.	Ndowooza tusaanidde okukikola.
We are all these things.	Ffe ebintu bino byonna.
I had nothing and no one but you.	Nali sirina kintu kyonna era tewali muntu yenna okuggyako ggwe.
But he made an early impression.	Naye yakola ekifaananyi nga bukyali.
We’re going to do that this week.	Ekyo tugenda kukikola wiiki eno.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
The attitude was good.	Endowooza yali nnungi.
That’s true, of course.	Ekyo kituufu, mazima ddala.
He comes closer.	Ajja kumpi.
They are here now.	Bali wano kati.
He won’t last long.	Tajja kumala bbanga ddene.
It is very simple and easy.	Kyangu nnyo era kyangu.
He is there right now.	Ali awo mu kiseera kino.
At the same time, of course.	Mu kiseera kye kimu, ddala.
It seems to be the job.	Kirabika nti gwe mulimu.
What we are with you is.	Kye tuli naawe oli.
That’s where we are now.	Awo we tuli kati.
But no one really knows for sure.	Naye ddala tewali amanyi bulungi.
I’m definitely not.	Nze mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
Thus it may be.	Bw’atyo kiyinza okuba.
You are so beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo.
He did a lot of talking.	Yakola nnyo okwogera.
He is the best.	Ye asinga obulungi.
That seems pretty normal.	Ekyo kirabika nga kya bulijjo nnyo.
I need to talk to you.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe.
This is not what it is.	Kino si kye kiri.
Honestly, we were going to have to.	Mu butuufu, twali tugenda kuba tulina okukikola.
It was on me.	Yali ku nze.
Dad I don’t know.	Taata simanyi.
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
He felt really good.	Yawulira bulungi ddala.
Not so much as it is.	Si nnyo nga bwe kiri.
I'll find another one.	Nja kufuna omulala.
That’s what he did.	Ekyo yakikola.
I’m sorry, but we need to go.	Nsonyiwa naye twetaaga okugenda.
He said he was perfectly fine this morning.	Yagambye nti enkya ya leero ali bulungi ddala.
Or not at all.	Oba si bwe kiri n’akatono.
Now it’s his turn.	Kati kye kiseera kye.
All in one place.	Byonna mu kifo kimu.
It is a very urgent matter.	Ensonga ya mangu nnyo.
No one was on.	Tewali yali ku...
He did it for me.	Yakikola gyendi.
I didn’t want to talk to him.	Nnali saagala kwogera naye.
He would have been very happy.	Yandibadde musanyufu nnyo.
. . . .	.
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
He definitely needed help.	Mazima ddala yali yeetaaga obuyambi.
That’s really a problem.	Ekyo ddala kizibu.
It was something serious, apparently.	Yali kintu kya maanyi, kirabika.
It doesn’t really matter.	Si kikulu nnyo.
And the movie.	Ne firimu.
He was very popular.	Yali muganzi nnyo.
Work, work, that was all he knew.	Omulimu, omulimu, ekyo kyokka kye yali amanyi.
With it, everything will work.	Nga tulina, buli kimu kijja kukola.
We have to move forward.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso.
He wasn’t good.	Yali si mulungi.
We all need to get out of the house.	Ffenna twetaaga okuva mu nnyumba.
That wasn’t what it was.	Ekyo si kye kyali.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
Or what he wanted.	Oba kye yali ayagala.
He was himself.	Ye yali ye kennyini.
He was alone in the room.	Yali yekka mu kisenge.
I pray it isn’t.	Nze nsaba si bwe kiri.
It was very quick as well.	Yali ya mangu nnyo era.
He is in no danger right now.	Tali mu bulabe bwonna kati kati.
That’s not really true.	Ekyo mu butuufu si kituufu.
He needed to make money.	Yali yeetaaga okukola ssente.
It might be a good one.	Kiyinza okuba nga kirungi.
But now the thing is, getting home.	Naye kati ekintu kiri nti, okutuuka awaka.
He is dangerous to me.	Ali wa bulabe gyendi.
And that was a serious issue for them.	Era eyo yali nsonga ya maanyi gye bali.
But this is not uncommon.	Naye kino si kya bulijjo.
He is all over my house.	Ali mu nnyumba yange yonna.
Knowing what you want to do is important.	Okumanya ky’oyagala okukola kikulu.
To all of us.	Eri ffenna.
Everyone is better off.	Buli muntu asinga kubeera mulungi.
I loved that house.	Ennyumba eyo nnali njagala nnyo.
. . . .	.
Something is going on there.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso eyo.
I was at my office.	Nnali ku ofiisi yange.
But he was so much more than just that.	Naye yali asinga nnyo ekyo kyokka.
But of course .	Naye ddala .
This is not an easy thing to do.	Kino si kintu kyangu kukikola.
You are my best friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange asinga.
He knew he could.	Yali akimanyi nti asobola.
But nothing good.	Naye tewali kirungi.
But the thing is.	Naye ekintu kiri nti.
However, he is not happy.	Kyokka, si musanyufu.
He has one younger brother.	Alina muto omu.
I don’t even want to do it.	Saagala na kukikola.
I’m so sick of it.	Nze ndi mulwadde nnyo.
He doesn't know what to say.	Tamanyi kya kwogera.
This is him	Oyo ye .
You can just .	Osobola okumala .
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
I really didn’t want to go home.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kudda waka.
I couldn’t answer.	Nnali sisobola kuddamu.
But he was a kid, still a kid.	Naye yali mwana muto, nga akyali mwana muto.
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
No harm yet.	Tewali bulabe bwonna n’okutuusa kati.
I loved working though.	Nnali njagala nnyo okukola wadde.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
No one spoke much.	Tewali yayogera nnyo.
Not at all, he said.	Si bwe kiri n’akatono, bwe yagambye.
Right, that’s what it is.	Kituufu, ekyo kye kiri.
And it doesn’t really matter the answer.	Era si kikulu nnyo okuddamu.
He was ready now.	Yali mwetegefu kati.
You just have to be this.	Olina okuba nga kino kyokka.
That would be a real problem.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu ddala.
No idea what or how.	Tewali kirowoozo ku kiki oba ngeri ki.
And very thoughtful.	Era nga alowooza nnyo.
And it’s going on.	Era kigenda mu maaso.
That was good at that.	Ekyo yali mulungi mu ekyo.
He said it would be good.	Yagambye nti kijja kuba kirungi.
No, he was fine.	Nedda, yali bulungi.
I love movies.	Njagala nnyo firimu.
It’s very hard not to.	Kizibu nnyo obutakola.
You are not ready to know.	Toli mwetegefu kumanya.
He doesn’t like anything about her.	Tewali ky’ayagala ku ye.
I have no idea who he was.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ani gwe yali.
And his brother, of course.	Era muganda we, ddala.
You can’t go on.	Tosobola kugenda mu maaso.
It doesn’t matter to us.	Si kikulu gye tuli.
It is in the best interest of everything.	Kiri mu bulungi bwa buli kimu.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
It is not a place of prison.	Si kifo kya kkomera.
There is so much more.	Waliwo bingi nnyo.
Though I’m not entirely sure.	Wadde nga sikakasa ddala.
We were a group of friends.	Twali kibiina kya mikwano.
Now, where is that dog .	Kati, embwa eyo eri ludda wa .
It’s not good to eat.	Si kirungi kulya.
Not even when he was sick.	Si ne bwe yali mulwadde.
Of course he could have.	Kya lwatu yali asobola okuba nga yakikola.
I didn’t quite know what to do.	Nnali simanyi bulungi kya kukola.
It was very real to me, as always.	Kyali kya ddala nnyo gyendi, nga bulijjo.
Now or nothing.	Kati oba tewali.
And we need to do it quickly.	Era tulina okukikola mu bwangu.
We have until morning.	Tulina okutuusa ku makya.
In school, too.	Mu ssomero, era.
It was very real.	Kyali kya ddala nnyo.
I think he might be.	Ndowooza ayinza okuba nga.
No one really knows.	Tewali amanyi ddala.
I think .	Ndowooza .
He was nobody, he said.	Yali si muntu yenna, bwe yagambye.
I want to be going.	Njagala okuba nga ngenda.
Don't know how to answer though.	Tomanyi ngeri ya kuddamu wadde.
I love the bottom.	Njagala nnyo wansi.
I live in my room almost all the time.	Mbeera mu kisenge kyange kumpi buli kiseera.
I’m in a hurry.	Nze ndi mu bwangu.
It was here before and it’s not now.	Kyali wano emabegako era si bwe kiri kati.
I don’t have any issues.	Sirina nsonga yonna.
She looks good anyway.	Alabika bulungi mu ngeri yonna.
You will do this too.	Kino naawe ojja kukikola.
This is why you need to speak up.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki olina okwogera.
But it wasn’t like that.	Naye nga si bwe yali.
But he goes on.	Naye agenda mu maaso.
I just needed space.	Nnali nneetaaga kifo kyokka.
And they were like him.	Era baali nga ye.
How difficult it is .	Nga kizibu nnyo .
I really have.	Ddala nnina.
I thought it might be .	Nalowooza nti kiyinza okuba nga .
He didn’t want money.	Yali tayagala ssente.
In fact, they were lucky.	Mu butuufu, baali ba mukisa.
It was time to do anything.	Kyali kiseera kya kukola kintu kyonna.
This can certainly backfire.	Kino mazima ddala kiyinza okudda emabega.
That won’t do any harm.	Ekyo tekijja kukola bulabe bwonna.
It’s just normal.	Kya bulijjo kyokka.
Not with anyone.	Si na muntu yenna.
It could have been almost anything.	Kyandibadde kumpi ekintu kyonna.
Not that, he thought.	Si ekyo, bwe yalowooza.
I think he is really sick.	Ndowooza ddala mulwadde.
No chance now.	Tewali mukisa kati.
Continuation .	Okugenda mu maaso .
He has a younger brother.	Alina muto we.
But you know exactly who he is.	Naye omanyi ddala ky’ali.
I really am .	Nze ddala ndi .
I know what he meant.	Nze kye yali ayagala okwogera nkimanyi.
Maybe it’s true.	Mpozzi nga mazima.
That’s all, obviously.	Ekyo kyokka, kya lwatu.
But one issue at a time.	Naye ensonga emu ku emu.
This alone will not work.	Kino kyokka tekijja kukola.
I hoped it would be enough.	Nali nsuubira nti kijja kumala.
That was true and untrue at the same time.	Ekyo kyali kituufu era nga si kituufu mu kiseera kye kimu.
My brother was here.	Muganda wange yali wano.
That one will work, of course.	Oyo ajja kukola, mazima ddala.
He's been here before.	Abadde wano emabegako.
This was all he needed.	Kino kyokka kye yali yeetaaga.
There is so much more.	Waliwo bingi nnyo.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
That was how he was at the time.	Bw’atyo bwe yali mu kiseera ekyo.
I wondered the same thing myself.	Nze kennyini nnali nneebuuza ekintu kye kimu.
I suppose someone must be.	Nsuubira omuntu alina okuba nga.
We were alone in the room with him.	Twali ffekka mu kisenge naye.
He was asleep at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali yeebase.
It is not that .	Si bwe kiri nti .
This is on me.	Kino kiri ku nze.
He was just glad they were okay.	Yali musanyufu kyokka nti baali bulungi.
My father is at work.	Taata ali ku mulimu.
He wanted to do things.	Yali ayagala okukola ebintu.
I think about myself.	Nze ndowooza ku nze.
You certainly were.	Mazima ddala wali.
You know that.	Ekyo okimanyi.
Not his girlfriend.	Si muganzi we.
This may not always have been the case.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga si bwe kyali bulijjo.
He wants to come back here.	Ayagala kudda wano.
There is no reason to be afraid.	Tewali nsonga lwaki otya.
However, it is not.	Kyokka si bwe kiri.
You were .	Ggwe wali .
It’s awful to watch.	Kibi nnyo okulaba.
I could eat that myself.	Ekyo nnali nsobola okulya nzekka.
No, everything is very normal.	Nedda, buli kimu kya bulijjo nnyo.
But that doesn’t really matter now.	Naye ekyo mu butuufu si kikulu kati.
He could have easily done this.	Kino yandibadde asobola bulungi okukikola.
No money in it now.	Tewali ssente mu yo kati.
I’m sure it will come to me.	Nkakasa nti kijja kujja gyendi.
We have each other.	Tulina buli omu.
We have to do it again.	Tulina okuddamu okukikola.
In practice this is not really good.	Mu nkola kino mu butuufu si kirungi.
If he had been, he would have been in jail.	Singa yali abadde, yandibadde mu kkomera.
This is easy for me.	Kino kyangu gyendi.
It was a difficult night, though.	Kyokka ekiro ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
And he is the best.	Era ye asinga obulungi.
You know, hungry.	Omanyi, enjala.
I don’t really know.	Mu butuufu simanyi.
This was true of him even as a child.	Kino kyali kituufu ku ye ne bwe yali akyali mwana muto.
And what he is.	Ne ky’ali.
It’s not money at all.	Si ssente n’akatono.
You don’t really have anything.	Mu butuufu tolina kintu kyonna.
I am all one thing.	Nze byonna ndi kintu kimu.
He obviously knew it.	Kya lwatu nti yali akimanyi.
We have plenty of time tomorrow.	Tulina obudde bungi enkya.
But what a player.	Naye nga muzannyi ki.
Knowledge is thought.	Okumanya ye ndowooza.
He is always an issue.	Bulijjo abeera nsonga.
They are in a difficult time.	Bali mu kiseera kizibu.
However, that is very dangerous.	Kyokka, ekyo kya bulabe nnyo.
Then he said .	Awo n'agamba nti .
It seems like he’s the only one.	Kirabika nga ye yekka.
So he got time.	Bwatyo yafuna obudde.
And yet here we were.	Era naye wano we twali.
And everyone was happy.	Era buli omu yali musanyufu.
That’s what he said.	Ekyo kye yayogera.
I'll be good.	Nja kuba mulungi.
No man lives here.	Tewali musajja abeera wano.
In a sense, he already has.	Mu ngeri emu, yalina dda.
This was a powerful room.	Kino kyali kisenge kya maanyi.
You can drive safely.	Osobola okuvuga nga tolina bulabe.
We were almost there, almost there.	Twali kumpi awo, kumpi awo.
You know how to do it.	Omanyi okukikola.
You have to be here now.	Olina okuba wano kati.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
As in practice.	Nga bwe kiri mu nkola.
Not, of course, in any way.	Si, ddala, mu ngeri yonna.
You don’t have to allow that to happen.	Ekyo tolina kukkiriza kubaawo.
It would be very difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
He told me he had a plan.	Yang’amba nti alina enteekateeka.
In any case that comes.	Mu mbeera yonna ejja.
And well it was for that.	Era bulungi kyali kya ekyo.
I am fine with that now.	Ekyo ndi bulungi kati.
He thought he was doing well.	Yalowooza nti yali akola bulungi.
However, that is simply not true.	Kyokka, ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
I’ll know when I have to go.	Nja kumanya ddi lwe nnina okugenda.
He couldn’t believe he did it.	Yali tayinza kukkiriza nti yakikola.
You need to know that you can too.	Olina okumanya nti naawe osobola.
I don’t know who it is.	Simanyi ani.
He was someone like you or me.	Yali muntu nga ggwe oba nze.
We don’t even have to talk.	Tetulina na kwogera.
Good job !!.	Omulimu omulungi !!.
I doubt the same.	Nze nbuusabuusa ekintu kye kimu.
But it was for both of them.	Naye kyali kya bombi.
Someone absolutely has to do it.	Omuntu alina okukikola ddala.
I can speak.	Nsobola okwogera.
he is the one.	ye bwe kiri.
Actually, it was pretty good.	Mu butuufu, kyali kirungi nnyo.
It’s up to us.	Kiri eri ffe.
That is very dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe nnyo.
I am not one or the other.	Siri omu oba omulala.
But no, this is real.	Naye nedda, kino kya ddala.
It’s a very difficult problem.	Kizibu kizibu nnyo.
This would be true.	Kino kyandibadde kituufu.
It was there though.	Kyali awo wadde.
That is not the case now.	Ekyo si bwe kiri kati.
Very good, my brother.	Kirungi nnyo muganda wange.
He said he would try.	Yagambye nti agenda kugezaako.
That’s the truth, of course.	Ekyo kye kituufu, ddala.
He knows what that is.	Amanyi ekyo bwe kiri.
I should be doing that.	Ekyo nsaanidde okuba nga nkola.
Very good, of course.	Kirungi nnyo, ddala.
You don’t have to do this.	Kino tolina kukikola.
Right downstairs.	Wansi ddala.
It’s not a bad thing.	Si kintu kibi.
He was probably doing better now.	Oboolyawo yali akola bulungi kati.
He thinks a lot about you.	Alowooza nnyo ku ggwe.
Much better than my car.	Kirungi nnyo okusinga mmotoka yange.
However, it was wrong.	Kyokka, kyali kibi.
It’s easy to talk to him.	Kyangu okwogera naye.
He knows very well.	Amanyi bulungi nnyo.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
He was probably there already.	Oboolyawo yali awo dda.
And, we are alone.	Era, tuli ffekka.
Not now, anyway.	Si kati, mu ngeri yonna.
Money is very important.	Ssente kikulu nnyo.
To someone else.	Eri omuntu omulala.
This is exactly my point.	Eno y’ensonga yange ddala.
He was still very young at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali akyali muto nnyo.
You can see how it is.	Osobola okulaba bwe kiri.
It’s not just one thing.	Si kintu kimu kyokka.
But there was one thing.	Naye nga waliwo ekintu kimu.
I think you know we have to do this.	Ndowooza okimanyi nti kino tulina okukikola.
I wish she was here now.	Njagala yandibadde wano kati.
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza.
It seems to me that there are three.	Kirabika gyendi nti waliwo ssatu.
And certainly not now.	Era mazima ddala si kati.
As we all should.	Nga bwe tusaanidde ffenna.
And now it’s real.	Era kati kya ddala.
We cannot accept this.	Kino tetusobola kukkiriza.
What am I sorry for? 	Nsonyiwa kiki?
That’s bad, but it’s just bad.	Ekyo kibi, naye kibi kyokka.
I have no idea which one.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku ki.
It’s a police problem.	Kizibu kya poliisi.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
He didn’t have a girlfriend.	Yali talina muganzi we.
That’s not quite true.	Ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
No one has friends here.	Tewali alina mikwano wano.
He was already in prison.	Yali dda mu kkomera.
That wasn’t the case.	Ekyo si bwe kyali.
But of course.	Naye ddala.
Not at all, actually.	Si bwe kiri n’akatono, mu butuufu.
The food would be good.	Emmere yandibadde nnungi.
I think, of course, that he was.	Ndowooza, ddala, nti yali.
It’s going to happen.	Kigenda kubaawo.
Back tomorrow morning.	Okudda enkya ku makya.
Everything is very complicated.	Buli kimu kizibu nnyo.
That was all he had to do.	Ekyo kyokka kye yalina okukola.
This is actually true.	Kino mu butuufu kituufu.
You can’t stay here.	Tosobola kusigala wano.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
His brother stepped forward.	Muganda we yagenda mu maaso.
Money is nothing.	Ssente tewali kintu kyonna.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
And now, perhaps, his wife.	Era kati, mpozzi, mukyala we.
You can do whatever you want.	Osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
Maybe he would be.	Mpozzi yandibadde bw’atyo.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
That’s a party group.	Ekyo kibiina kya kibiina.
This is good for me.	Kino kirungi gyendi.
And we can’t all do it well.	Era ffenna tetusobola bulungi.
Apparently no one is home.	Kirabika tewali muntu yenna ali waka.
He was with her, here.	Yali naye, wano.
Now he knew better.	Kati yali amanyi bulungi.
How can you do it? 	Oyinza otya?
. . . .	.
But he was asleep too.	Naye naye yali yeebase.
He was willing.	Yali ayagala.
We have to move forward.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso.
I don’t need anything.	Sirina kye nneetaaga.
My father knows that.	Ekyo taata akimanyi.
Just a little bit, but it’s something.	Katono ddala, naye nga kintu.
I’m sure it’s nothing.	Nkakasa nti si kintu kyonna.
It’s not something you want.	Si kintu ky’oyagala.
I can’t eat much this morning.	Enkya ya leero sisobola kulya nnyo.
I’m working here now.	Nze nkola wano kati.
Indeed, that is true.	Mazima ddala, ekyo kituufu.
I know which is which.	Nze mmanyi ki kye ki.
He must be asleep.	Ateekwa okuba nga yeebase.
You are so powerful.	Oli wa maanyi nnyo.
He would need to go.	Yandibadde yeetaaga okugenda.
You have it, too.	Naawe olina.
He will have to know now.	Ajja kuba alina okumanya kati.
You are like my father.	Oli nga taata wange.
I’m on it right now.	Nze ndi ku yo mu kiseera kino.
This was very easy.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo.
We’re all here to make money.	Ffenna tuli wano okukola ssente.
This was certainly the case here.	Kino mazima ddala bwe kyali wano.
He just had something he needed.	Yalina ekintu kyokka kye yali yeetaaga.
I know a lot about that.	Ekyo nkimanyi bingi ku nsonga eyo.
Who knows what.	Ani amanyi kiki.
He will do it.	Ajja kukikola.
I know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi.
Though it wasn't his only fear.	Wadde nga si kye kyokka kye yali atya.
I definitely know you can do it.	Nkimanyi ddala nti osobola okukikola.
We are friends.	Tuli ba mukwano.
But for each other.	Naye ku lwa buli omu.
You would like to.	Wandyagadde.
But you can’t win office.	Naye tosobola kuwangula ofiisi.
He could have done it.	Yali asobola okukikola.
He had been my everything.	Yali abadde buli kimu kyange.
No one should know what he thought.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kumanya kye yalowooza.
I’m not going to do anything about it.	Sigenda kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
How complicated the problem is.	Engeri ekizibu gye kiri ekizibu.
Someone has something.	Waliwo alina ky’alina.
But just a little bit.	Naye katono ddala.
He might, he might, he might.	Ayinza, ayinza, ayinza.
And not in every city.	Era si mu buli kibuga.
Why, of course.	Lwaki, ddala.
Almost on a one-to-one basis.	Kumpi ku kimu ku kimu.
I think this is very common.	Ndowooza kino kya bulijjo nnyo.
That comes to me.	Ekyo kijja gyendi.
I need time to think.	Nze nneetaaga obudde okulowooza.
In his case.	Mu mbeera ye.
No, we have no choice.	Nedda, tetulina kya kukola.
This is a daunting task.	Guno mulimu gwa maanyi nnyo.
We must say that .	Tulina okugamba nti .
He had already moved on.	Yali amaze okugenda mu maaso.
Or maybe not.	Oba mpozzi nedda.
I think a lot.	Ndowooza nnyo.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
What is he going to do.	Agenda kukola ki.
Good for you, good for them.	Kirungi gy’oli, kirungi gye bali.
My opinion is that.	Endowooza yange eri nti.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
My father was here.	Taata yali wano.
He was a practical man.	Yali muntu wa nkola.
I didn’t want to be like him.	Nnali saagala kubeera nga ye.
Or the phone.	Oba essimu.
We were at school together.	Twali ku ssomero nga tuli wamu.
I knew nothing about all that.	Ebyo byonna nnali sirina kye mmanyi.
That’s what we are.	Ekyo kye tuli.
You can’t stay here.	Tosobola kusigala wano.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
Not exactly well, but he was trying.	Si bulungi ddala, naye yali agezaako.
Until he .	Okutuusa lwe ya .
This was very easy.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo.
We have and we have.	Tulina era tulina.
And you will, too.	Era naawe ojja kukikola.
We can’t do without that.	Ekyo tetusobola kukikola nga tetulina.
He wanted to eat dinner.	Yali ayagala okulya ekyeggulo.
I am nowhere to be found.	Nze tewali we ndi wa.
Tonight, it’s not.	Ekiro kino, si bwe kiri.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Era si kibi.
He seems to have a point.	Alabika alina ensonga.
But yes, of course.	Naye ye, ddala.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
That’s all we have to do.	Ekyo kyokka kye tulina okukola.
I didn’t know how to respond.	Nnali simanyi ngeri ya kuddamu.
I won't go.	Sijja kugenda.
I’m a young man.	Nze ndi muto.
He was ready to go home.	Yali mwetegefu okudda eka.
That, he thought, was it.	Ekyo, bwe yali alowooza nti, kye kyali.
We will have to talk here.	Tujja kuba tulina okwogera wano.
But he's been around too long already.	Naye amaze ebbanga ddene nnyo dda.
And, of course, it’s very difficult.	Era, ddala, kizibu nnyo.
And it doesn’t matter now.	Era si kikulu kati.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
I guess it’s in the air.	Ntebereza nti kiri mu bbanga.
And now he didn't know what to do.	Era kati yali tamanyi kya kukola.
You have to leave home for that.	Ekyo olina okuva awaka.
It was of both.	Yali ya bombi.
Please help again.	Nsaba okuddamu okuyamba.
I might think it is but it isn’t.	Nnyinza okulowooza nti bwe kiri naye si bwe kiri.
Try as he might, he couldn't do it.	Nga bwe yagezaako, yali tasobola kukikola.
Anyone can do anything.	Omuntu yenna asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
The same is true of you.	Kye kimu ne ggwe.
It really was him.	Ddala ye yali ye.
I've struggled to do it right.	Nze nfunye obuzibu okukikola obulungi.
Maybe not everyone can.	Mpozzi si buli muntu nti asobola.
He thought he was a schoolteacher.	Yalowooza nti yali musomesa wa ssomero.
Everyone except me.	Buli muntu okuggyako nze.
He wants more.	Ayagala bingi.
He knew he would be.	Yali akimanyi nti yandibadde.
And it still isn’t.	Era n’okutuusa kati si bwe kiri.
And he hopes to go with her.	Era asuubira okugenda naye.
To really see.	Okulaba ddala.
He must be right.	Ateekwa okuba nga kituufu.
I always wanted to go.	Bulijjo nnali njagala nnyo okugenda.
Perhaps that was the problem.	Oboolyawo ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
You go into a low state.	Ogenda mu mbeera ya wansi.
And then there you are.	Era awo waliwo ggwe.
You go backwards.	Ggwe ogenda emabega.
He certainly could.	Mazima ddala yali asobola.
But not like he did.	Naye si nga bwe yakola.
And it won’t happen.	Era tekijja kubaawo.
It was going on.	Kyali kigenda mu maaso.
No, it really isn’t.	Nedda, ddala si bwe kiri.
No one had to know.	Tewali muntu yenna yalina kumanya.
Not always, of course.	Si bulijjo, ddala.
But he looked pretty happy himself.	Naye yalabika bulungi nga musanyufu ye kennyini.
And it’s very easy.	Era kyangu nnyo.
She is not a woman.	Si mukyala.
No one knew how to do it.	Tewali yali amanyi ngeri ya kukola.
He certainly doesn’t know.	Mazima ddala tamanyi.
In practice, this will not always be the case.	Mu nkola, kino tekijja kubaawo bulijjo.
You would be a wonderful friend.	Wandibadde mukwano mulungi nnyo.
This is very, very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo nnyo.
I always want to know what that would be like.	Bulijjo njagala okumanya ekyo bwe kyandibadde.
That, of course, is not true.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, si kituufu.
We have a reason.	Tulina ensonga.
It’s not common though.	Si kya bulijjo wadde.
There’s your phone.	Waliwo essimu yo.
I was very, very interested.	Nali njagala nnyo nnyo.
No one is doing well.	Tewali akola bulungi.
I have no idea about that either.	Ekyo nange sirina ndowooza yonna.
Maybe that’s the point.	Mpozzi eyo nsonga.
I would love any perspective on this problem, though.	Njagala nnyo endowooza yonna ku kizibu kino, wadde.
I just didn’t know at the time.	Nze mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi kyokka.
You’re here a lot.	Ggwe wano nnyo.
This is not serious.	Kino si kya maanyi.
I can talk to you.	Nsobola okwogera naawe.
You can’t go away.	Tosobola kugenda.
. . . .	.
I guess no one did.	Ntebereza tewali yakikola.
I don't know why.	Ensonga lwaki simanyi.
And his friends.	Ne mikwano gye.
Urgent! 	Mangu!
urgent! 	mangu!
The office, that was it.	Ofiisi, ekyo kye kyali.
There is something.	Waliwo ekintu.
That's the one who comes to us.	Oyo y'ajja gye tuli.
I don't know in what place.	Simanyi mu kifo ki.
He couldn’t be here.	Yali tasobola kubeera wano.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Kya lwatu nti kino si bwe kiri.
But he wasn’t happy.	Naye nga si musanyufu.
And then there you are.	Era awo waliwo ggwe.
This is a real one.	Eno ya ddala.
And plenty of time.	Era obudde bungi.
He worked very, very hard.	Yakola nnyo nnyo.
We cannot accept this.	Kino tetusobola kukkiriza.
And herein lies the problem.	Era wano we wali obuzibu.
He was already there.	Yali dda.
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
That night I was in my room.	Ekiro ekyo nnali mu kisenge kyange.
No patient experienced adverse events.	Tewali mulwadde yafuna buzibu.
I don’t have anyone.	Sirina muntu yenna.
I’m doing something.	Nze nnina kye nkola.
Will go again soon.	Ajja kuddamu okugenda mu bbanga ttono.
I will be	Nja kuba .
I don’t know how much.	Simanyi ssente mmeka.
That was his character.	Eyo ye yali engeri ye.
No one knows what they are.	Tewali amanyi kye bali.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
You want a job.	Oyagala omulimu.
And he obviously knew that.	Era ekyo kirabika yali akimanyi.
And you, my brother.	Naawe muganda wange.
I thought we had a chance.	Nalowooza nti tulina omukisa.
The police, of course.	Poliisi, ddala.
He is ready.	Ye mwetegefu.
That is not the case at all.	Ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
How lucky we were!.	Nga twali ba mukisa!.
He went to sleep, he thought.	Yagenda nga yeebase, bwe yalowooza.
We have to talk.	Tulina okwogera.
I don’t have time for this.	Kino sirina budde.
He was almost there.	Yali kumpi awo.
I have no idea about this.	Kino sirina kye mmanyi.
Clearly, he should not be in office.	Kya lwatu nti tasaanidde kubeera mu ofiisi.
I work really hard.	Nkola nnyo ddala.
He would have been there.	Yandibadde awo.
But already he was moving on.	Naye dda yali agenda mu maaso.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
He can’t say what it is.	Tasobola kwogera kye kiri.
And that is very, very dangerous.	Era ekyo kya bulabe nnyo nnyo.
This can be a problem.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
He was a doctor.	Yali musawo.
He seems to be in a very good place.	Alabika ali mu kifo kirungi nnyo.
It seems a little inaccurate though.	Kirabika nga si kituufu katono wadde.
Now he spoke.	Kati yayogera.
It was a car.	Yali mmotoka.
Everyone is happy and cheerful.	Buli omu musanyufu era musanyufu.
I have hope.	Nnina essuubi.
And then he knew.	Era awo n’amanya.
I will do everything.	Nja kukola buli kimu.
My point is kind of.	Ensonga yange eri mu ngeri.
Not before, not now, not always.	Si emabegako, si kati, si bulijjo.
The food came.	Emmere yajja.
All this .	Bino byonna .
But it’s difficult.	Naye kizibu.
He didn’t want to stay where he was.	Yali tayagala kusigala we yali.
Something for everyone, really.	Ekintu kya buli muntu, ddala.
But it almost always comes at a high cost.	Naye kumpi bulijjo kijja ku ssente nnyingi.
You know you want to.	Omanyi nti oyagala.
I still don’t know why.	N’okutuusa kati simanyi lwaki.
That is why he was so passionate about this job.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki yali ayagala nnyo omulimu guno.
That’s not a good thing.	Ekyo si kirungi.
I think we can.	Ndowooza tusobola.
I don’t want to do this tonight.	Kino saagala kukikola ekiro kino.
Of course, it’s more complicated than that.	Kya lwatu nti kizibu okusinga ekyo.
But he was so beautiful.	Naye nga mulungi nnyo.
Everyone is as good as you.	Buli muntu mulungi nga ggwe.
But no one said anything for a moment.	Naye tewali yayogera kintu kyonna wadde akaseera katono.
This is really awful.	Kino ddala kibi nnyo.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
Starvation began immediately.	Enjala yatandika mangu ddala.
I already thought as much.	Nalowooza dda nga bingi.
This is happening every day.	Kino kigenda mu maaso buli lunaku.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
He was indeed really happy.	Mazima yali musanyufu ddala.
He is with you all the time.	Ali naawe buli kiseera.
He is the reason you are here.	Ye nsonga lwaki oli wano.
I didn’t have much of a plan.	Nnali sirina nnyo nteekateeka.
And it may be true.	Era kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
The only thing .	Ekintu kyokka .
He just wasn’t going to go.	Yali tagenda kugenda kyokka.
Nothing is easy.	Tewali kintu kyangu.
Anything can happen to a man.	Buli kimu kiyinza okutuuka ku musajja.
He is always going to be with us.	Bulijjo agenda kubeera naffe.
I don’t have much.	Sirina bingi.
Not that it really mattered.	Si nti ddala kyali kikulu.
She was very beautiful.	Yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
He moved on and no one could answer.	Yagenda mu maaso nga tewali asobola kuddamu.
You won’t have time to watch anything.	Tojja kufuna budde kulaba kintu kyonna.
He certainly is.	Mazima ddala y’ali.
Always three, obviously.	Bulijjo ssatu, kya lwatu.
I had no answer.	Nnali sirina kya kuddamu.
That is not the truth.	Ekyo si kye kituufu.
It can be very simple and easy.	Kiyinza okuba nga kyangu nnyo era nga kyangu.
Three weeks from tomorrow.	Wiiki ssatu okuva enkya.
This is why we need help.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki twetaaga obuyambi.
You are my wife.	Ggwe mukyala wange.
We are one and the same.	Tuli kimu era tuli kimu.
Not a father at all.	Si taata n'akatono.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
No! 	Nedda!
And that’s what he had to do.	Era ekyo kye yalina okukola.
You actually have an opinion about it.	Mu butuufu olina endowooza ku nsonga eyo.
Or you’re not alone.	Oba si wekka.
Now is the time to make a plan.	Kati kye kiseera okukola enteekateeka.
I still didn’t know much about the man.	Nali n’okutuusa kati nnali simanyi bulungi ku musajja oyo.
And this would be true.	Era kino kyandibadde kituufu.
But you might be.	Naye oyinza okuba nga.
For him, it could be.	Ku ye, kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
I wanted to talk to him.	Nnali njagala okwogera naye.
No one said anything.	Tewali yayogera kintu kyonna.
The beautiful one.	Omulungi.
We will do this.	Kino tujja kukikola.
It seems so easy to me.	Kirabika nga kyangu nnyo gyendi.
I'll see.	Nja kulaba.
Certainly not one on one.	Mazima ddala si omu ku omu.
And now a child.	Era kati mwana.
This is obviously not very good.	Kino kirabika si kirungi nnyo.
But yes, he did.	Naye ye, yakikola.
But you’re not alone.	Naye si ggwe wekka.
I know that it is not.	Nkimanyi nti si bwe kiri.
He was very talkative.	Yali ayogera nnyo.
Not good, but it could have been worse.	Si kirungi, naye kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
She looks better week after week.	Alabika bulungi wiiki ku wiiki.
He already had it.	Yalina dda.
It’s definitely not to everyone’s liking.	Mazima ddala si kya kwagala buli muntu.
Maybe you love the past.	Mpozzi nga oyagala nnyo emabega.
Not with him.	Si naye.
So far, no problems.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali buzibu.
Maybe he will be able to find a job.	Mpozzi ajja kusobola okufuna omulimu.
He would have been there.	Yandibadde awo.
He would have to back off.	Yandibadde alina okudda emabega.
You can’t do this.	Kino tosobola kukikola.
Or he thought he did.	Oba yalowooza nti yakikola.
It was really really overwhelming.	Ddala ddala kyali kizibu nnyo.
And why he needs to get his money.	Era lwaki yeetaaga okufuna ssente ze.
And it is very dangerous.	Era kya bulabe nnyo.
He is in great shape today.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo leero.
And that’s my whole point.	Era eyo y’ensonga yange yonna.
He had no wife or issues.	Yali talina mukyala wadde ensonga.
You go to them.	Ggwe ogenda gye bali.
Now, he thought.	Kati, bwe yalowooza.
Reluctantly, he did.	Nga tayagala, yakikola.
And it was costly.	Era kyali kya ssente nnyingi.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
This is my job.	Guno gwe mulimu gwange.
My brother was there, in the room.	Muganda wange yali awo, mu kisenge.
Really, any issue at all would be good.	Ddala, ensonga yonna n’akatono yandibadde nnungi.
Mostly for him, maybe even a little for yourself.	Okusinga ku ye, mpozzi n’akatono ku ggwe kennyini.
I was here for you.	Nze nali wano.
It’s just in us.	Kiri mu ffe kyokka.
That’s really dangerous for us.	Ekyo ddala kya bulabe gye tuli.
We both need money.	Ffembi twetaaga ssente.
A little bit of it.	Katono ddala.
He didn’t want this.	Kino yali tayagala.
I am very lucky.	Nze ndi wa mukisa nnyo.
And he does so.	Era akola bw’atyo.
It was a powerful place.	Kyali kifo kya maanyi nnyo.
Or maybe he did.	Oba oboolyawo yakikola.
I couldn’t really do anything.	Mu butuufu nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
Or my brother.	Oba muganda wange.
You love your car.	Oyagala nnyo mmotoka yo.
And now you are so good to me.	Era kati oli mulungi nnyo gyendi.
This is, of course, simple.	Kino, kya lwatu, kyangu.
We can go home.	Tusobola okudda eka.
Now it’s a pretty common thing.	Kati kintu kirungi kya bulijjo.
No one knew the answer.	Tewali yali amanyi kya kuddamu.
He probably won’t be here.	Oboolyawo tajja kubeera wano.
He knew better, now.	Yali amanyi bulungi, kati.
And in great quantity.	Era mu bungi bungi.
I can’t stay with you.	Sisobola kusigala naawe.
He could think.	Yali asobola okulowooza.
And there was hunger.	Era nga waliwo enjala.
And here he was.	Era wano we yali.
We have to do well.	Tulina okukola obulungi.
That’s not a problem.	Ekyo si kizibu.
Maybe it’s true.	Mpozzi nga kituufu.
I will do this.	Kino nja kukikola.
He would have loved that.	Ekyo yandibadde ayagala nnyo.
He would have been with her.	Yandibadde naye.
But maybe it’s time.	Naye mpozzi kye kiseera.
He doesn’t need to be reworked.	Teyeetaaga kuddamu kukola.
He thinks he is better than us.	Alowooza nti asinga ffe.
But he was beautiful.	Naye yali mulungi.
I don’t know about any of this.	Simanyi ku kintu kyonna ku bino.
Actually, of course not.	Mu butuufu, ddala si bwe kiri.
Now everything is fine.	Kati buli kimu kiri bulungi.
This issue went on and on.	Ensonga eno yagenda mu maaso.
And this dinner.	Era ekyeggulo kino.
But he knew it wasn’t.	Naye yali akimanyi nti si bwe kiri.
I won’t eat.	Sijja kulya.
I was in no mood to go home.	Nnali siri mu mbeera ya kugenda waka.
And then there’s this thing at the bottom.	Era awo waliwo ekintu kino wansi.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I need to know he is okay.	Nnina okumanya nti ali bulungi.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I always have and always will.	Bulijjo nnina era bulijjo nja kukikola.
But it’s not easy.	Naye si kyangu.
It’s always the same.	Bulijjo kye kimu.
Now, it’s bad.	Kati, kibi.
Maybe more there than here.	Mpozzi okusinga eyo okusinga wano.
And so he had.	Era naye bwe yalina.
There is that.	Waliwo ekyo.
But no, it’s not.	Naye nedda, nedda.
We also have .	Tulina ne .
I have a lot of him.	Nnina bingi ku ye.
He didn’t have time for this.	Kino yali talina budde.
But someone was.	Naye waliwo omuntu yali...
That's what it is, that's all.	Ekyo kye kiri, ekyo kyokka.
Or for every reason.	Oba lwa buli nsonga.
Someone making a movie.	Omuntu ng’akola firimu.
Like that might happen.	Nga ekyo bwe kiyinza okubaawo.
I needed to do that.	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga okukikola.
I think that’s the problem.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kizibu.
He didn’t know how to talk to her.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ya kwogera naye.
He wanted to know what that was like.	Yali ayagala okumanya ekyo bwe kyali.
Or maybe not him.	Oba oboolyawo si ye.
Almost, but not quite.	Kumpi, naye si ddala.
There is .	Waliwo .
But, of course, he needs to be both.	Naye, kya lwatu, yeetaaga okuba bombi.
You were lucky today.	Obadde wa mukisa leero.
Or for anyone else.	Oba ku muntu omulala yenna.
He had so many movies.	Yalina firimu nnyingi nnyo.
Everyone should be.	Buli muntu yandibadde.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
You can say whatever you want about me.	Osobola okwogera kyonna ky’oyagala ku nze.
There that is.	Eyo ekyo kiri.
He was definitely a nice guy.	Mazima ddala yali ggaayi mulungi.
That’s really the point.	Eyo ddala y’ensonga.
He tries to say then that.	Agezaako okugamba awo ekyo.
Like you right now.	Nga ggwe kati kati.
If not for him, someone like him would.	Singa si ye, omuntu nga ye yandikoze.
Until he was here.	Okutuusa lwe yali wano.
Who is with me?.	Ani ali nange?.
He needs to drive.	Yeetaaga okuvuga.
Clearly, he was not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe yali.
He knew what he was.	Yali amanyi kye yali.
. . . .	.
It can be a person or a job.	Kiyinza okuba omuntu oba omulimu.
This is also not a good practice.	Eno era si nkola nnungi.
He is very curious.	Ayagala nnyo okumanya.
The police came with everything.	Poliisi yajja ne buli kimu.
This looks really, really good.	Kino kirabika bulungi ddala, ddala.
That’s not being too serious.	Ekyo si kubeera kikulu nnyo.
You have a plan.	Olina enteekateeka.
He wasn’t, of course.	Yali si bwe yali, ddala.
You won’t have time to do anything.	Tojja kufuna budde bwa kukola kintu kyonna.
Everything looks good so far.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi okutuusa kati.
He appears to belong to .	Alabika nga wa .
No one has ever .	Tewali muntu yenna abadde .
Nobody wants to play with me.	Tewali ayagala kuzannya nange.
And he does well.	Era akola bulungi.
He already got one.	Yafuna dda emu.
I am happy to be here.	Ndi musanyufu okubeera wano.
That was the whole point, he told me.	Eyo ye yali ensonga yonna, bwe yang’amba.
But you have to see my problem.	Naye olina okulaba ekizibu kyange.
He seemed almost .	Yalabika kumpi .
I couldn’t do that.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola.
And he still didn’t know what to say.	Era n’okutuusa kati yali tamanyi kya kwogera.
That’s why you’re here.	Y’ensonga lwaki oli wano.
He just knew it.	Yali akimanyi kyokka.
He was on.	Yali ku...
But it’s my friend.	Naye mukwano gwange.
That was great to see.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo okulaba.
The food he made.	Emmere gye yakola.
He knew that wasn’t true.	Yali akimanyi nti ekyo si kituufu.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
I want the same for you.	Nze naawe njagala kye kimu.
I'll answer again.	Nja kuddamu okuddamu.
In my case, it was a disaster.	Mu mbeera yange, kyali kizibu kya maanyi.
He can do everything right.	Asobola okukola buli kimu obulungi.
He almost always had.	Kumpi bulijjo yalina.
I was very young, very fit.	Nnali muto nnyo, nga ndi mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
Everything is close by.	Buli kimu kiri kumpi awo.
It’s going to be prison for me from now on.	Kigenda kuba kkomera gyendi okuva kati.
He didn’t need anyone.	Yali teyeetaaga muntu yenna.
And it was so easy.	Era nga kyangu nnyo.
He hadn't had it in a while.	Yali amaze ebbanga nga talina.
He had no wife.	Yali talina mukyala yenna.
He was my best friend.	Yali mukwano gwange nnyo.
But it was happening anyway.	Naye kyali kigenda mu maaso mu ngeri yonna.
A week ago.	Wiiki emu emabega.
There maybe you will eat.	Eyo mpozzi ojja kulya.
You’re going to be like him.	Ogenda kubeera nga ye.
No circumstances, nothing.	Tewali mbeera, tewali kintu kyonna.
In this view of the subject.	Mu ndowooza eno ku nsonga.
You can do all of those things.	Ebintu ebyo byonna osobola okukola.
What a difficult thought.	Nga kirowoozo kizibu nnyo.
He is not strong.	Si wa maanyi.
But it’s very real.	Naye nga kya ddala nnyo.
However, this is not the case here.	Kyokka kino si bwe kiri wano.
It is a beautiful thing .	Kintu kirungi nnyo .
However, that was fine.	Kyokka, ekyo kyali kirungi.
I didn’t know much more than that.	Nnali simanyi bingi okusinga ekyo.
But he had nothing for me.	Naye yali talina kintu kyonna gyendi.
And you can talk about someone else doing it.	Era osobola okwogera ku muntu omulala okukikola.
There is no power.	Tewali maanyi.
And so does his dad.	Era ne taata we bw’atyo bw’atyo.
But that is not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu.
This is him	Oyo ye .
But back to love.	Naye okudda mu kwagala.
But he is only one person.	Naye ye muntu omu yekka.
And of course, he had.	Era ddala, yalina.
That was the point.	Eyo yali nsonga.
This is, of course, true.	Kino, kya lwatu, kituufu.
In that respect, we are lucky.	Mu nsonga eyo, tulina omukisa.
You do what you want.	Ggwe okola ky’oyagala.
I want it yesterday.	Njagala jjo.
Glad you like it.	Musanyufu nti oyagala.
It was a wonderful time.	Kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo.
And there is time.	Era waliwo obudde.
He just couldn’t.	Yali tasobola kyokka.
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
Not true, of course.	Si kituufu, ddala.
Obviously it was good.	Kya lwatu kyali kirungi.
He would have to do it.	Yandibadde alina okukikola.
And he wanted her too.	Era yali ayagala naye naye.
I’m here in the evening.	Nze ndi wano akawungeezi.
Here they both were.	Wano bombi baali.
I think he knew it.	Ndowooza yali akimanyi.
But he didn't know what was going to happen now.	Naye yali tamanyi kyali kigenda kubaawo kati.
He loves it here.	Ayagala nnyo wano.
It's a difficult place for you.	Kifo kizibu gy'oli.
In fact, he hardly even wanted to eat.	Mu butuufu, yali tayagala nnyo wadde okulya.
I did it too.	Nange yakikola.
And he is a good friend of mine.	Era mukwano gwange mulungi.
I didn’t have it.	Nze nnali sirina.
That's like maybe.	Ekyo nga mpozzi.
I didn’t want to be alone.	Nnali saagala kubeera nzekka.
No one knew what to do.	Tewali yali amanyi kya kukola.
He could eat anything he wanted.	Yali asobola okulya ekintu kyonna kye yali ayagala.
I love to eat and be well together.	Njagala nnyo okulya era nga ndi wamu bulungi.
How very, very close.	Nga kumpi nnyo nnyo.
I love this picture.	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi kino.
He is not harmless.	Si talina bulabe ye.
Someone else will have to do it.	Omuntu omulala ajja kuba alina okukikola.
Either one, or the other.	Oba omu, oba omulala.
I think she was still my wife.	Ndowooza yali akyali mukyala wange.
It was the truth.	Yali mazima.
He lives in the city.	Abeera mu kibuga.
He is a doctor.	Ye musawo.
Not for the house.	Si lwa nnyumba.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ye mukyala mulungi.
I have to win anyway.	Nnina okuwangula mu ngeri yonna.
This can certainly happen, and most likely will.	Kino mazima ddala kiyinza okubaawo, era okusinga kijja kubaawo.
That is what is simple.	Ekyo kye kiri nti kyangu.
Even when he had to.	Ne bwe yali alina okukikola.
However, not at this time.	Kyokka, si mu kiseera kino.
You will proceed to the office.	Ojja kugenda mu maaso ne ofiisi.
I hope he comes.	Nsuubira nti ajja.
In this process.	Mu nkola eno.
Whatever it is, it’s time.	Kyonna kye kiri, kye kiseera.
I love dogs.	Njagala nnyo embwa.
You would have to preach.	Wandibadde olina okubuulira.
But not a bad place, at that.	Naye si kifo kibi, ku ekyo.
But he was still here, all right.	Naye yali akyali wano, bulungi.
But there was a phone.	Naye nga waliwo essimu.
There is nothing good.	Tewali kirungi kyonna.
Nothing too serious was happening.	Tewali kintu kya maanyi nnyo kyali kigenda mu maaso.
There is no easy answer.	Tewali kyangu kya kuddamu.
It was time to call her dad.	Kyali kiseera okukuba essimu ya taata we.
It will not happen .	Tekijja kubaawo .
The night of.	Ekiro kya...
This can be very difficult though.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo wadde.
But we certainly will.	Naye mazima ddala tujja kukikola.
Now there is no such thing.	Kati tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
She loves dogs.	Ayagala nnyo embwa.
And it was a sin.	Era kyali kibi.
Don’t go to the police.	Togenda ku poliisi.
So is my brother.	Bwatyo bwa muganda wange.
Or from me.	Oba okuva mu nze.
That's, like, local.	Ekyo, nga, kya wano.
But this is not quite true.	Naye kino si kituufu nnyo.
I’m going to be fine.	Ngenda kubeera bulungi.
That is not love.	Ekyo si kwagala.
It’s not always the same.	Bulijjo si kye kimu.
Soon he would be good.	Mu bbanga ttono yandibadde mulungi.
I was so scared.	Nali ntya nnyo.
Not now anyway.	Si kati mu ngeri yonna.
It really looks good.	Ddala kirabika bulungi.
That's the only problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyokka.
It was a pretty dull night.	Ekiro ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo nga kizibu.
That's my whole point.	Eyo y'ensonga yange yonna.
He obviously had a point.	Kya lwatu nti yalina ensonga.
Yesterday, tomorrow, tonight.	Eggulo, enkya, ekiro kino.
I’m going to be with you.	Ngenda kubeera naawe.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
Very very close.	Kumpi nnyo nnyo.
Nothing too serious.	Tewali kintu kya maanyi nnyo.
I am happy to be here.	Ndi musanyufu okubeera wano.
The whole thing was his idea.	Ekintu kyonna kyali kirowoozo kye.
I don’t know what to expect, either.	Simanyi kye nsuubira, naawe.
But that’s not the case now though.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri kati wadde.
I don’t know, downstairs.	Simanyi, wansi.
We’ll have dinner in town.	Tujja kulya ekyeggulo mu kibuga.
This is very normal for me.	Kino kya bulijjo nnyo gyendi.
I think he would like that.	Ndowooza ekyo yandiyagadde.
Really, apparently, a lot.	Ddala, kirabika, bingi.
And you have to read everything.	Era olina okusoma buli kimu.
It was time to strike.	Kyali kiseera okukuba.
Not too long, he thought.	Si bbanga ddene nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
It’s almost true.	Kumpi kituufu.
To do whatever he wanted.	Okukola buli kye yali ayagala.
While my brother is very ill, you will have to go.	Nga muganda wange mulwadde nnyo, ojja kuba olina okugenda.
I think you’re strong.	Ndowooza ggwe wa maanyi.
I can’t go anymore.	Sisobola kuddamu kugenda.
It will be a very difficult situation.	Ejja kuba mbeera ya buzibu nnyo.
It's just at home.	Kiri waka kyokka.
It may be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
One of us will be here all night.	Omu ku ffe ajja kuba wano ekiro kyonna.
And delivery is everything.	Era okutuusa kye kintu kyonna.
I didn’t want to do that.	Ekyo nnali saagala kukikola.
We should get away from that.	Ekyo tusaanidde okuva ku ekyo.
I think and yes.	Ndowooza era ye.
This is a good thing.	Kino kintu kirungi.
That's not the issue now.	Eyo si y'ensonga kati.
In fact, it isn’t.	Mu butuufu, si bwe kiri.
I love it so much!!!.	Njagala nnyo!!!.
And my father.	Ne taata wange.
It’s going to be fine.	Kigenda kuba bulungi.
He was probably asleep.	Oboolyawo yali yeebase.
When he needed to finish.	Nga yeetaaga okumala.
In theory it might work.	Mu ndowooza kiyinza okukola.
In fact, only one was.	Mu butuufu, omu yekka ye yali.
He couldn’t let that happen.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
It can be difficult.	Kiyinza okuba nga kizibu.
I’ve known how to do that.	Nze mbadde mmanyi okukola ekyo.
He works very, very, very hard.	Akola nnyo nnyo nnyo.
It’s not just enough to get what you want.	Si kumala kumala kufuna ky’oyagala.
Only one can.	Omu yekka asobola.
He couldn’t seem to do it.	Yalabika nga tasobola kukikola.
But he seemed happy.	Naye yalabika nga musanyufu.
Now he spoke.	Kati yayogera.
It is not for the present.	Si kya kiseera kino.
And now he had it.	Era kati yalina.
It's nothing to you.	Si kintu kyonna gy'oli.
I can say anything.	Nsobola okwogera ekintu kyonna.
But he has it too.	Naye naye alina.
You can’t do anything here.	Wano tosobola kukola kintu kyonna.
No one knows better than anyone else.	Tewali amanyi okusinga omuntu omulala yenna.
But it's just so good.	Naye kyokka nga kirungi nnyo.
This is not an old idea.	Eno si ndowooza ya dda.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I could have gone.	Nnali nsobola okugenda.
I can't see.	Sisobola kulaba.
But he couldn’t.	Naye yali tasobola.
There is so much food.	Emmere nnyingi nnyo.
Evening, weekday.	Akawungeezi, olunaku lwa wiiki.
He is a very good teacher.	Musomesa mulungi nnyo.
He always wants to be good.	Bulijjo ayagala okuba omulungi.
Day in and day out.	Olunaku ku lunaku.
He's already gone.	Yagenda dda.
I don’t want to know.	Saagala kumanya.
He likes to go fast.	Ayagala nnyo okugenda amangu.
Maybe he should have.	Mpozzi yandibadde alina.
For me, this is very difficult.	Nze kino kizibu nnyo.
That was a bit of luck.	Ekyo kyali kya mukisa katono.
Perhaps this was true.	Oboolyawo kino kyali kituufu.
Someone else might have done that.	Omuntu omulala ayinza okuba nga yakola ekyo.
Everything is going to be great.	Buli kimu kigenda kuba kirungi nnyo.
I’m not home much.	Siri waka nnyo.
To my car.	Eri mmotoka yange.
I want to make money.	Njagala kufuna ssente.
He had food.	Yalina emmere.
I have no answer.	Sirina kya kuddamu.
You have me in you.	Olina nze mu ggwe.
He was probably already asleep.	Oboolyawo yali yeebase dda.
We're going.	Tugenda.
And it’s mine.	Era kyange.
Not anything, really.	Si kintu kyonna, ddala.
It was me, all about me.	Nali nze, byonna ku nze.
He is a really good friend of mine.	Ye mukwano gwange omulungi ddala.
I knew nothing about him at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
I needed a job.	Nnali nneetaaga omulimu.
Maybe this is true.	Mpozzi kino kituufu.
It was my issue.	Yali nsonga yange.
It could be you.	Kiyinza okuba nga ggwe.
It was so real and so powerful.	Kyali kya ddala nnyo era kya maanyi nnyo.
He didn’t need one.	Yali teyeetaaga emu.
What a good point.	Nga nsonga nnungi.
I was thinking that too.	Nze nange nnali ndowooza ekyo.
Or even beauty.	Oba wadde obulungi.
Or even that he wants to.	Oba wadde nti ayagala.
That is not the truth.	Ekyo si kye kituufu.
I am a young child.	Ndi mwana muto.
Please, no, this is a really bad idea.	Nsaba, nedda, kino kirowoozo kibi ddala.
We just didn’t have anything.	Twali tetulina kye tulina kyokka.
I wanted a house.	Nnali njagala nnyumba.
We’ll see something like this.	Tujja kulaba ekintu nga kino.
We have to do this.	Kino tulina okukikola.
That seems pretty cool.	Ekyo kirabika nga kirungi nnyo.
He'll talk about the clock.	Ajja kwogera ku ssaawa.
It was just easy, easy, easy.	Kyali kyangu kyokka, kyangu, kyangu.
And it was difficult.	Era kyali kizibu.
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kirungi.
We all need to do this.	Kino ffenna twetaaga okukikola.
It had to be him.	Yalina okuba nga ye.
This can be helpful.	Kino kiyinza okuyamba.
You have to go well.	Olina okugenda obulungi.
But it’s really.	Naye nga ddala.
I hope that’s not the case.	Nsuubira nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
I want to be us.	Njagala kubeera ffe.
They’re not, and that mindset needs to go.	Si bwe bali, era endowooza eyo yeetaaga okugenda.
You are like him.	Ggwe oli nga ye.
It won’t quite suffice now.	Tekijja kumala nnyo kati.
However, he has this problem.	Kyokka, alina ekizibu kino.
Not on his watch.	Si ku ssaawa ye.
I think it would be important.	Ndowooza kyandibadde kikulu.
I didn’t need anything.	Nnali sirina kye nneetaaga.
I expect a lot of things now.	Nsuubira ebintu bingi kati.
I am always on time.	Bulijjo mbeera mu budde.
It’s good for all of us.	Kirungi eri ffenna.
No one did except us.	Tewali yakola okuggyako ffe.
I hope to do well in school.	Nsuubira okukola obulungi mu ssomero.
He may well do it.	Ayinza bulungi okukikola.
I didn’t think it would matter.	Nnali sirowooza nti kijja kuba kikulu.
I’m the only one.	Nze omu yekka.
He did more than she did.	Yakola bingi okusinga ye.
Maybe you knew that.	Mpozzi ekyo wali okimanyi.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
And in this case, he certainly should have known better.	Era mu mbeera eno, mazima ddala yandibadde amanyi bulungi.
I am not home, this is not home.	Siri waka, eno si waka.
But he does it for everyone.	Naye akikola ku buli muntu.
I couldn’t do anything.	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
I don’t know anything.	Sirina kye mmanyi.
It is the work of my class.	Omulimu gwa kibiina kyange.
He needed to hit something, badly.	Yali yeetaaga okukuba ekintu, ennyo.
It seems more complicated than it really is.	Kirabika kizibu okusinga bwe kiri ddala.
That’s exactly what we are.	Ddala bwe tuli.
How beautiful you look.	Nga olabika bulungi nnyo.
Can anyone answer on this.	Waliwo asobola okuddamu ku nsonga eno.
He is stronger than any of us.	Asinga amaanyi ku ffe yenna.
It may work, or it may not.	Kiyinza okukola, oba obutakola.
Not me, yet.	Si nze, n’okutuusa kati.
But it seems to be the same.	Naye kirabika nga kye kimu.
I thought it was there.	Nalowooza nti kyali awo.
Week after week.	Wiiki ne wiiki.
But it was really bad for a while.	Naye ddala kyali kibi okumala akaseera.
No one here could do as much.	Tewali muntu yenna wano yali asobola kukola bingi nga bino.
He can’t wait.	Tasobola kulinda.
I need time to think about this.	Nze nneetaaga obudde okulowooza ku nsonga eno.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
That morning.	Enkya eyo.
He would have no knowledge.	Yandibadde talina kumanya.
You can’t be alone.	Tosobola kubeera wekka.
But you don’t have it.	Naye ggwe tolina.
I want to see the faces.	Njagala kulaba maaso.
And it is that .	Era kiri nti .
He thought of something.	Yalowooza ku kintu.
I am happy about it.	Ndi musanyufu ku nsonga eyo.
He is very together.	Ali wamu nnyo.
That is why he knows everything.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki buli kimu akimanyi.
He is on one now.	Ali ku emu kati.
But you leave very quickly.	Naye ogenda mangu ddala.
I'll come to that.	Nja kujja ku ekyo.
He couldn’t be there, in the house.	Yali tasobola kubeerawo, mu nnyumba.
I thought it would be normal.	Nalowooza nti yandibadde ya bulijjo.
Surely it is for them.	Mazima gye bali bwe kiri.
I suppose that was the only problem.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kyokka kye kyali ekizibu.
I love the person.	Njagala nnyo omuntu.
I can’t live without my wife.	Sisobola kubeerawo nga sirina mukyala wange.
Or something.	Oba ekintu.
This is not what we have here.	Kino si kye tulina wano.
No one knows at this point.	Tewali amanyi mu kiseera kino.
I don’t go to the hospital.	Sigenda mu ddwaaliro.
He needs to see.	Yeetaaga okulaba.
And there’s something in that.	Era waliwo ekintu mu ekyo.
And he knew, to this day, that he wasn’t.	Era yali akimanyi, okutuuka leero, nti si bwe yali.
My problem is that you can’t.	Ekizibu kyange nti tosobola.
And no one knows it.	Era tewali akimanyi.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
I am a human being.	Nze ndi muntu.
He had been by her side.	Yali abadde ku ludda lwe.
Not suddenly, not so much.	Si mu bwangu, si nnyo.
And he did a pretty good job of it.	Era yakikola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
But that’s not really the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri ddala.
We just have to talk to him.	Tulina kumala kwogera naye.
I love your opinion.	Njagala nnyo endowooza yo.
That’s just normal.	Ekyo kya bulijjo kyokka.
This is really bad.	Kino ddala kibi.
Right now, that could be hours.	Mu kiseera kino, ekyo kiyinza okuba essaawa.
Maybe not much.	Mpozzi si bingi.
Or perhaps it would.	Oba oboolyawo kyandibadde.
He may well be helpless right now.	Ayinza bulungi okuba nga tasobola buyambi mu kiseera kino.
But he would be together.	Naye yandibadde wamu.
He must have been asleep.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali yeebase.
he wants it that way.	ayagala bw’atyo.
The plan comes into play.	Enteekateeka ejja mu nkola.
He wasn’t sick at all.	Yali si mulwadde n’akatono.
For this he is close.	Ku kino ali kumpi.
I wanted to respond.	Nnali njagala kuddamu.
It won’t be easy, but we will do it.	Tekijja kuba kyangu, naye tujja kukikola.
He is an ordinary child.	Mwana wa bulijjo.
The things we need.	Ebintu bye twetaaga.
I could easily imagine how he was doing that.	Nnali nsobola bulungi okulowooza ku ngeri gye yali akola ekyo.
They were very strong about it.	Baali ba maanyi nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
You have a reason.	Olina ensonga.
He should have gone.	Yandibadde agenda.
There for everyone.	Eyo ku lwa buli omu.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
I don’t know what to expect.	Simanyi kye nsuubira.
He was like that.	Yali bw’atyo.
I am happy .	Ndi musanyufu .
I’m not sure why.	Sikakasa lwaki.
That would be a problem.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
We’re going to get that again.	Ekyo tugenda kuddamu okufuna.
That’s really great.	Ekyo ddala kirungi nnyo.
But he is not happy.	Naye si musanyufu.
It would be nice if he could.	Kyandibadde kirungi singa asobola.
But he is a man with a plan.	Naye ye musajja alina enteekateeka.
I don’t care.	Sifaayo.
No money, nothing.	Tewali ssente, tewali kintu kyonna.
I will go myself.	Nze kennyini nja kugenda.
I was thinking about something.	Nnali ndowooza ku kintu.
He is a good player though.	Muzannyi mulungi wadde.
But everyone else.	Naye buli omu omulala.
They are here every day.	Bali wano buli lunaku.
And it was the same.	Era bwe kyali.
I’m not going to say anything.	Sigenda kwogera kintu kyonna.
You don’t have to be here.	Tolina kubeera wano.
She was fine, she told me.	Yali bulungi, bwe yang’amba.
It’s in the room.	Kiri mu kisenge.
You're with me.	Oli nange.
Or if he was thinking at all.	Oba oba yali alowooza n’akatono.
Here was where he was.	Wano we yali wa.
No one knew what to believe.	Tewali yali amanyi kya kukkiriza.
No one even knew we were together yet.	Tewali yali na kumanya nti tuli wamu n’okutuusa kati.
I just want to know.	Njagala kumanya kyokka.
I want to do .	Njagala okukola .
Not true, of course.	Si kituufu, ddala.
This was normal.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo.
And this is a good time to do it.	Era kino kiseera kirungi okukikola.
Maybe he didn’t need a car.	Mpozzi nga teyeetaaga mmotoka.
Certainly not his friend.	Mazima ddala si mukwano gwe.
Probably to his girlfriend.	Oboolyawo eri muganzi we.
I know you are a good man.	Nkimanyi oli musajja mulungi.
Anyone could do it.	Omuntu yenna yali asobola okukikola.
This was just a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu kyokka.
This is where everything is.	Wano buli kimu we kiri.
That was really easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu ddala.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange asinga.
This is a common practice.	Eno nkola ya bulijjo.
And there was.	Era nga waliwo.
Everyone is asleep.	Buli omu yeebase.
Not a child.	Si mwana.
This was the case with my father.	Kino kye kyali ku taata.
You work hard.	Okola nnyo.
He didn’t want to go.	Yali tayagala kugenda.
We have an opportunity to do that.	Tulina omukisa okukikola ekyo.
And one moves on.	Era omu agenda mu maaso.
He doesn’t need to do that.	Teyeetaaga kukola ekyo.
What we have to do is.	Kye tulina okukola kiri nti.
But he will come back to you.	Naye ajja kudda gy’oli.
It was for that.	Yali ya ku awo.
He has one.	Alina emu.
I guess we can answer.	Ntebereza nti tusobola okuddamu.
It wasn’t.	Yali nedda.
I need this book.	Nneetaaga ekitabo kino.
It’s completely up to you.	Kiri gy’oli ddala.
He'd been a kid then, too.	Yali abadde mwana muto mu kiseera ekyo, naye.
I don’t know how to do that.	Ekyo simanyi ngeri ya kukikola.
I’m sure this was great.	Nkakasa nti kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
Maybe even a friend.	Mpozzi ne mukwano gwe.
He had no one on the side.	Yali talina muntu yenna ku ludda.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
Good in the room.	Kirungi mu kisenge.
He doesn’t want to go home.	Tayagala kudda waka.
Now that he had .	Kati nga bwe yalina .
Here we are friends.	Wano tuli mikwano.
Or a little while.	Oba akaseera katono.
This is a common practice.	Eno nkola ya bulijjo.
No one knows what to do.	Tewali amanyi kya kukola.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
almost anything.	kumpi ekintu kyonna.
I’m sure it will happen.	Nkakasa nti kijja kubaawo.
You can’t really tell, but it’s there.	Mu butuufu tosobola kumanya, naye kiri awo.
No, he was nobody.	Nedda, yali si muntu yenna.
I didn’t know what to do.	Nnali simanyi kya kukola.
Doing this is easy.	Okukola kino kyangu.
Maybe he was asleep.	Mpozzi nga yeebase.
I just wanted to talk to him.	Nnali njagala kwogera naye kyokka.
No one will know.	Tewali ajja kumanya.
No one will help.	Tewali ajja kuyamba.
It’s hard not to.	Kizibu obutakola.
But getting to the point.	Naye okutuuka ku nsonga.
But only for the moment.	Naye mu kiseera kino kyokka.
You are good at this.	Oli mulungi mu kino.
We’re both here.	Ffembi tuli wano.
He wanted to be alone.	Yali ayagala kubeera yekka.
No one can have what it is.	Tewali muntu ayinza kuba na kye kiri.
But my brother knows it.	Naye muganda wange akimanyi.
From the city.	Okuva mu kibuga.
He can say whatever he wants to say.	Asobola okwogera kyonna ky’ayagala okwogera.
But he has his own house.	Naye alina ennyumba ye.
No one was that good.	Tewali yali mulungi bw’atyo.
That was a good idea and everything.	Ekyo kyali kirowoozo kirungi era buli kimu.
He said something.	Waliwo kye yayogera.
He had his time.	Yalina obudde bwe.
It was a bad time.	Kyali kiseera kibi.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
That’s not too bad.	Ekyo si kibi nnyo.
He makes money.	Akola ssente.
He was behind me.	Yali emabega wange.
This is simple, but very powerful.	Kino kyangu, naye nga kya maanyi nnyo.
He loved to drive cars.	Yali ayagala nnyo okuvuga mmotoka.
I can’t speak for the organization.	Sisobola kwogera ku lwa kibiina.
That is a powerful thing.	Ekyo kintu kya maanyi nnyo.
He knows he wants to.	Akimanyi nti ayagala.
And that was pretty cool.	Era ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
That’s pretty normal.	Ekyo kirungi kya bulijjo.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali.
No one can know he is here.	Tewali ayinza kumanya nti ali wano.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
But it wasn’t, not really.	Naye si bwe kyali, si bwe kyali ddala.
You can see everything.	Oyinza okulaba buli kimu.
This is very, very bad.	Kino kibi nnyo nnyo.
That was fine with me, though.	Kyokka ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
This is not the case at the moment.	Kino si bwe kiri mu kiseera kino.
He knew it and she knew it.	Yali akimanyi era naye yali akimanyi.
I don’t have a problem.	Nze tewali buzibu.
You’ll be just fine.	Ojja kuba bulungi nnyo.
Obviously, it’s not for everyone.	Kya lwatu nti si ya buli muntu.
I’m not sure it will happen.	Sikakasa nti kijja kubaawo.
This is not an obvious place.	Kino si kifo kya lwatu.
He had me.	Yalina nze.
I guess we'll work it out as we go along.	Ntebereza tujja kukikola nga bwe tugenda.
And and and and and.	Na na na na.
You can talk to me, you know.	Osobola okwogera nange, omanyi.
We can all go.	Ffenna tusobola okugenda.
I might as well.	Nze nnyinza nga bwe kiri.
I do the same thing.	Nze nkola kye kimu.
He was working alone.	Yali akola yekka.
That was probably a good thing.	Ekyo oboolyawo kyali kintu kirungi.
It’s a matter of action.	Ensonga ya kukola.
It’s good for us.	Kirungi gye tuli.
He was real.	Yali wa ddala.
And it will be easier.	Era kijja kuba kyangu.
I don’t know how long.	Simanyi bbanga ki.
And he is probably my best friend.	Era osanga ye mukwano gwange ennyo.
That is the problem we have.	Ekyo kye kizibu kye tulina.
He could come back to us.	Yali asobola okudda gye tuli.
Now, that will do it.	Kati, ekyo kijja kukikola.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
It’s easy for them.	Kyangu gye bali.
He obviously doesn’t want to talk to us.	Kya lwatu tayagala kwogera naffe.
I needed food.	Nnali nneetaaga emmere.
I hope he did.	Nsuubira nti yakikola.
. . . .	.
He was going to prison.	Yali agenda mu kkomera.
You have a friend in me now.	Olina mukwano mu nze kati.
He shouldn’t have done this.	Kino yali tasaanidde kukikola.
However, this is not all.	Kyokka, kino kyokka si bwe kiri.
He said it might help.	Yagambye nti kiyinza okuyamba.
It was him, and yet it wasn’t.	Yali ye, era naye si bwe kyali.
He can’t be here.	Tasobola kubeera wano.
This is a good thing for all of us.	Kino kintu kirungi eri ffenna.
I didn’t know anyone.	Nnali simanyi muntu yenna.
But he didn’t want that.	Naye ekyo yali tayagala.
But this is not my place.	Naye kino si kye kifo kyange.
That was what he wanted to say.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala okwogera.
I'm at home.	Nze awaka.
In fact, it’s not even a movie.	Mu butuufu, si wadde firimu.
In this case, none.	Mu mbeera eno, tewali.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
This was just one of many.	Kino kyali kimu kyokka ku bingi.
No one knew that.	Ekyo tewali yali akimanyi.
Or that you should.	Oba nti olina okukikola.
He was really going.	Ddala yali agenda.
It could be tomorrow.	Kiyinza okuba enkya.
I’m afraid not very long at all.	Ntya si bbanga ddene nnyo n’akatono.
You have to do that yourself.	Ekyo olina okukikola ggwe kennyini.
That is everyone’s place.	Ekyo kye kifo kya buli muntu.
That’s not mine.	Ekyo si kyange.
Obviously, you are one.	Kya lwatu nti oli omu.
No, it’s really bad.	Nedda, ddala kibi.
I don’t think any of us would want that.	Sirowooza nti waliwo ku ffe yandiyagadde ekyo.
And there he was.	Era awo we yali.
This work is not for one person.	Omulimu guno si gwa muntu omu.
. . . .	.
I don’t know you either.	Nze naawe simanyi.
It’s hard for all of us.	Kizibu gye tuli ffenna.
But it’s busy.	Naye nga bbize.
I want to play.	Njagala kuzannya.
I can’t stay in one place for very long.	Sisobola kumala bbanga ddene nnyo mu kifo kimu.
He was a loner.	Yali muntu abeera yekka.
He really had it.	Ddala yalina.
He talked about you.	Yayogera ku ggwe.
I thought it was too dangerous.	Nalowooza nti kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
At this point, he knew it well.	Mu kiseera kino, yali akimanyi bulungi.
Nothing is more difficult than that.	Tewali kizibu okusinga ekyo.
He had to work hard.	Yalina okukola ennyo.
Something everyone knew.	Ekintu buli omu kye yali amanyi.
He is just one man.	Ye musajja omu yekka.
There is nothing real about the movie.	Tewali kintu kya ddala ku firimu.
Being yourself .	Okubeera ggwe kennyini .
That was just the right thing to do.	Ekyo kyali kituufu kyokka.
You are all those things and .	Ggwe ebintu ebyo byonna era .
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
We have to talk.	Tulina okwogera.
Not in himself.	Si mu ye kennyini.
What a daunting task.	Nga mulimu gwa maanyi nnyo.
Of course, that was probably the point.	Kya lwatu, oboolyawo eyo ye yali ensonga.
It’s what he loves.	Kye ky’ayagala ennyo.
He hoped he was safe.	Yalina essuubi nti yali talina bulabe.
He was in my house.	Yali mu nnyumba yange.
Meanwhile to get home.	Mu kiseera kino okutuuka awaka.
This may not work.	Kino kiyinza obutakola.
He is a very nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi nnyo.
I was forgiven.	Nnali nsonyiwa.
We have to see the whole picture.	Tulina okulaba ekifaananyi kyonna.
And it looks good.	Era kirabika bulungi.
And you are lucky he is.	Era oli wa mukisa ye.
It was for this.	Kyali lwa kino.
I’m not going to be in that movie.	Sigenda kubeera mu firimu eyo.
I knew that too.	Ekyo nange nnali nkimanyi.
And you are the one.	Era ggwe oli.
Going home was awful.	Okudda eka kyali kibi nnyo.
It’s not bad at all.	Si kibi n’akatono.
But you’ve been close to him.	Naye ggwe obadde kumpi naye.
Everyone does this, even me.	Buli muntu akola kino, ne nze.
I like to go fast.	Njagala nnyo okugenda amangu.
But that seems very unusual.	Naye ekyo kirabika si kya bulijjo nnyo.
It would be quite a party.	Kyandibadde kabaga nnyo.
More than all that.	Okusinga ebyo byonna.
Reading is very important.	Okusoma kikulu nnyo.
Where? 	Wa?
He obviously knows it.	Kya lwatu nti akimanyi.
Or maybe it’s just me.	Oba oboolyawo nga nze nzekka.
Not too good, and not too bad.	Si kirungi nnyo, era si kibi nnyo.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
No, he isn’t.	Nedda, si bw’atyo.
However, my father did.	Kyokka, taata yakikola.
All about the location.	Byonna ku kifo.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Kya lwatu nti kino si bwe kiri.
The dinner was wonderful.	Ekyeggulo kyali kirungi nnyo.
But not together, no.	Naye si wamu, nedda.
I’m just a player.	Nze ndi muzannyi yekka.
I was wondering about that.	Ekyo nnali nneebuuza.
It really is just that.	Mazima ddala kye kiri kyokka.
My boyfriend loves cars.	Muganzi wange ayagala nnyo mmotoka.
I might buy one.	Nnyinza okugula emu.
I didn’t have the money.	Nnali sirina ssente.
Don't know where this place is.	Tomanyi kifo kino gye kiri.
And this is not a party thing.	Era kino si kintu kya kibiina.
Not that she wanted him to.	Si nti yali ayagala akole.
There is nothing here .	Tewali kintu kyonna wano .
Everyone looks good to me.	Buli muntu alabika bulungi gyendi.
He didn’t have it.	Yali talina.
Not that he wanted or needed to.	Si nti yali ayagala oba yali yeetaaga.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
This is a powerful process.	Eno nkola ya maanyi nnyo.
I couldn’t find anyone.	Nnali sisobola kufuna muntu yenna.
I won't come.	Sijja kujja.
That’s hard to answer.	Ekyo kizibu okuddamu.
You can do it too.	Naawe osobola.
In fact, this may be more helpful.	Mu butuufu, kino kiyinza okusinga okuyamba.
I don’t want to be alone.	Saagala kubeera nzekka.
However, there are limitations to this approach.	Kyokka waliwo obuzibu mu nkola eno.
And maybe not.	Era mpozzi nedda.
That’s how he would always be.	Bw’atyo bwe yandibadde bulijjo.
She is a lonely woman.	Ye mukyala ali yekka.
Not that he thought that much either.	Si nti naye yalowooza nnyo bw’atyo.
Someone will do it.	Waliwo ajja kukikola.
It’s hard to see right now.	Kizibu okulaba mu kiseera kino.
He is doing well at work.	Akola bulungi ku mulimu.
But how I don't know.	Naye engeri gye simanyi.
He absolutely needs everything.	Buli kimu yeetaaga ddala.
It seems to be a good one.	Kirabika nga kirungi.
I can do it, easy.	Nsobola okukikola, kyangu.
It's hard to say whether he thought or not.	Kizibu okwogera oba yalowooza oba nedda.
I have to be in the process.	Nnina okuba nga ndi mu nkola.
I am so sorry about this.	Nsonyiwa nnyo ku nsonga eno.
You’re going to be there for a little while.	Ogenda kubeerawo okumala akaseera katono.
I wanted to talk to him.	Nnali njagala okwogera naye.
Probably my father.	Oboolyawo taata wange.
You’re a lover.	Oli muganzi.
You're fine.	Oli bulungi.
I could have gone to jail.	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu kkomera.
You're coming tonight.	Ojja ekiro kino.
Maybe you will too.	Mpozzi naawe.
We have to get out of here as soon as we can.	Tulina okuva wano nga bwe tusobola.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
But he is not alone.	Kyokka si ye yekka.
Soon, almost everyone was a musician.	Mu bbanga ttono, kumpi buli muntu yali muyimbi.
How can I do this.	Kino nnyinza ntya okukikola.
That’s not who we are.	Ekyo si kye tuli.
But he couldn’t, at all.	Naye yali tasobola, n’akatono.
It is part of this plan.	Kimu ku nteekateeka eno.
I need help with this.	Nneetaaga obuyambi ku nsonga eno.
Money isn’t the issue.	Ssente si y’ensonga.
In fact, it wasn’t.	Mu butuufu, si bwe kyali.
I hope you do the same.	Nsuubira nti naawe okola kye kimu.
It’s not a good movie.	Si firimu nnungi.
Not in the morning.	Si ku makya.
It was much closer than that.	Yali kumpi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He’s going to be a father.	Agenda kubeera taata.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Kya lwatu nti kino si bwe kiri.
I am in the hospital.	Ndi mu ddwaaliro.
It was a good idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
Someone has to say what it is .	Omuntu alina okwogera kye kiri .
That is not love.	Ekyo si kwagala.
It’s not easy.	Si kya bwangu.
Not at all.	Si bwe kiri n’akatono.
You would love that.	Ekyo wandyagadde nnyo.
He has been in a situation like this.	Abadde mu mbeera nga eno.
He’s going to be really good.	Agenda kuba mulungi ddala.
But there is no clock.	Naye tewali ssaawa.
I know, it’s hard.	Nkimanyi, kizibu.
Or last week.	Oba wiiki ewedde.
But he was strong.	Naye yali wa maanyi.
And not too early.	Era si nga bukyali nnyo.
At home, her dad faces them both.	Awaka, taata we ayolekedde bombi.
This is not the case today.	Kino si bwe kiri leero.
He is not well and will never be well.	Tali bulungi era tajja kuba bulungi.
You love to read.	Oyagala nnyo okusoma.
I couldn’t tell which.	Nnali sisobola kumanya ki.
I have to go now.	Nnina okugenda kati.
But it won’t be easy.	Naye tekijja kuba kyangu.
I don’t even know what to say about that.	Ekyo simanyi na kya kwogera.
I am a doctor.	Ndi musawo.
I've been thinking about something though.	Mbadde ndowooza ku kintu wadde.
He had to speak.	Yalina okwogera.
Nothing more powerful than that.	Tewali kintu kyonna kya maanyi okusinga ekyo.
That’s not at all unusual here.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo n’akatono wano.
I don’t want to be without you.	Saagala kubeera nga tolina ggwe.
As such, you are not alone.	Nga bwe kiri, toli wekka.
You’re just one guy.	Oli ggaayi omu yekka.
When you were as you were.	Bwe wali nga bwe wali.
That was his job.	Ekyo kye kyali omulimu gwe.
But it’s not serious, really.	Naye si kya maanyi, ddala.
Strong but beautiful.	Ya maanyi naye nga nnungi.
It was time to get out of here.	Kyali kiseera okuva wano.
He loves this very much.	Kino ayagala nnyo.
He was one man.	Yali musajja omu.
There was nothing he could do.	Tewali kintu kyonna kye yali asobola kukola.
I wanted money.	Ssente nnali njagala.
But he talked to me about it.	Naye yayogera nange ku nsonga eyo.
He just has to stay ready.	Alina kumala kusigala nga mwetegefu.
I am my own luck.	Nze ndi mukisa gwange.
She really was that good.	Ddala yali mulungi bw’atyo.
He is a friend of a friend of a friend.	Ye mukwano gwa mukwano gwa mukwano gwe.
But this is a practice now.	Naye eno nkola kati.
I love the person.	Njagala nnyo omuntu.
You have to go for that.	Olina okugenda ku ekyo.
I think he will come to us soon.	Ndowooza mu bbanga ttono ajja kujja gye tuli.
But it really is, actually .	Naye ddala bwe kiri, mu butuufu .
Not so far.	Si okutuuka wano.
He will do it.	Ajja kukikola.
Whatever he wants.	Kyonna ky’ayagala.
It probably won’t happen.	Oboolyawo tekijja kubaawo.
But it is absolutely true.	Naye kituufu ddala.
I can’t believe that fact.	Siyinza kukkiriza nsonga eyo.
That he could see that.	Ekyo yali asobola okulaba ekyo.
This is love.	Kino kye kwagala.
Good job.	Omulimu omulungi.
However, this is certainly not the case.	Kyokka, mazima ddala kino si bwe kiri.
You don’t have to be local, not all the time.	Tolina kuba wa wano, si buli kiseera.
He doesn't have to go.	Talina kugenda.
You have to win.	Olina okuwangula.
He will certainly do it.	Mazima ddala ajja kukikola.
Of course, not exactly.	Mazima ddala, si bwe kiri ddala.
You are an ordinary person.	Oli muntu wa bulijjo.
You have to know things like that.	Olina okumanya ebintu nga ebyo.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
Certainly not immediate.	Mazima ddala si kya mangu.
Maybe they both are.	Mpozzi bombi bwe bali.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
Nothing is going well.	Tewali kigenda bulungi.
What he knew.	Kye yali amanyi.
Thinking too much is wrong.	Okulowooza ennyo kibi.
He is everywhere, doing everything.	Ali buli wamu, akola buli kimu.
That’s the case, of course.	Ekyo bwe kiri, ddala.
He would be there today.	Yandibadde awo leero.
Not home, not home, no.	Si waka, si waka, nedda.
I won’t watch the movie.	Sijja kulaba firimu.
It’s not a bad thing.	Si kintu kibi.
You know how it is for me.	Omanyi bwe kiri gyendi.
She had to talk to him.	Yalina okwogera naye.
I have hope.	Nnina essuubi.
He does so much to go well.	Akola bingi nnyo okugenda obulungi.
This is the week.	Eno ye wiiki.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
I couldn’t see what the answer was to that.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kulaba kya kuddamu ki.
He .	Ye .
With a job.	Nga mulimu.
I could talk to him.	Nnali nsobola okwogera naye.
It would be three.	Kyandibadde ssatu.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
I didn’t think he could.	Nnali sirowooza nti yali asobola.
She knew it, too.	Naye yali akimanyi, naye.
But you have to be here.	Naye olina okuba wano.
He started as he had done before.	Yatandika nga bwe yakola emabegako.
Maybe he won’t.	Mpozzi tajja kukikola.
That’s not always true.	Ekyo si kituufu bulijjo.
And yet this is not all.	Era naye kino si kye kyokka.
But that’s not me.	Naye oyo si nze.
And maybe he could too, if he wanted to.	Era osanga naye yali asobola, singa yali ayagala.
We don’t have to deal with that.	Tetulina kukola ku nsonga eyo.
He doesn’t need to go alone.	Teyeetaaga kugenda yekka.
He must have seen it.	Ateekwa okuba nga yalaba.
That’s not who we are.	Ekyo si kye tuli.
He wasn’t, of course.	Si ye yali, ddala.
And we are not like that.	Era ffe si bwe tuli.
She was really gorgeous.	Ddala yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
It’s easy, and it’s easy.	Kyangu, era kyangu.
I have to leave this place.	Nnina okuva mu kifo kino.
Almost certainly a man.	Kumpi ddala musajja.
And of course he did.	Era ddala yakikola.
That would be a bad thing.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I think he knows that too.	Ndowooza ekyo naye akimanyi.
However, it will last a long time.	Kyokka, kijja kumala ebbanga ddene.
Not in my case, though.	Kyokka si mu mbeera yange.
I didn’t have to do it.	Nnali sirina kukikola.
He was a very strong man.	Yali musajja wa maanyi nnyo.
It can be very difficult.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
I'm sorry, no.	Nsonyiwa, nedda.
That won’t allow.	Ekyo tekijja kukkiriza.
I will do well.	Nja kukola bulungi.
Probably face-to-face talking.	Oboolyawo okwogera maaso ku maaso.
He is one man.	Ye musajja omu.
Which he needed to know.	Kye yali yeetaaga okumanya.
Maybe it could be simpler.	Mpozzi kiyinza okuba nga kyangu.
You just want to be with him.	Oyagala kubeera naye kyokka.
He was almost here.	Yali kumpi wano.
The problem is there.	Obuzibu buli awo.
He is doing well now.	Akola bulungi kati.
One expects, however, that this would be more difficult.	Kyokka, omuntu asuubira nti kino kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
You certainly have.	Mazima ddala olina.
He doesn’t have to be in a hurry.	Talina kuba wa bwangu.
We will all be home.	Ffenna tujja kuba awaka.
I need that one too.	Oyo nange nneetaaga.
He went anyway.	Yagenda mu ngeri yonna.
It’s not that kind of party.	Si kabaga ka ngeri eyo.
He is not in this system.	Tali mu nkola eno.
The problem is with me.	Obuzibu buli ku nze.
This was very close.	Kino kyali kya kumpi nnyo.
It’s actually worse than that.	Mu butuufu kibi okusinga ekyo.
It was just him.	Yali ye yekka.
It’s up to you, of course.	Kiri gy’oli, ddala.
But not immediately.	Naye si mu bwangu.
That is the hard problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu ekizibu.
In theory, this is true.	Mu ndowooza, kino kituufu.
He says all this quickly.	Bino byonna ayogera mangu.
Then he didn't know what to say.	Awo nga tamanyi kya kwogera.
I thought a lot of things.	Nalowooza ebintu bingi.
However, I have to say .	Kyokka, nnina okugamba nti .
And it’s a good job.	Era mulimu mulungi.
We will do it again.	Tujja kuddamu okukikola.
No baby, you're fine.	Nedda mwana, oli bulungi.
It is not the case now.	Si bwe kiri kati.
No! 	Nedda!
No! 	Nedda!
too young for that.	muto nnyo ku ekyo.
Work is very important.	Omulimu kikulu nnyo.
It was bad now that he thought he was leaving.	Kyali kibi kati bwe yalowooza nti agenda.
Right, actually.	Kituufu, mu butuufu.
That, you know, is the problem.	Ekyo, omanyi, kye kizibu.
It was a difficult time for me.	Kyali kiseera kizibu gyendi.
I don’t want to be that person.	Nze saagala kubeera muntu oyo.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
I thought you’d like to know.	Nalowooza nti wandyagadde okumanya.
And there it is.	Era awo we kiri.
I was almost certain it wasn’t.	Nali kumpi nkakasa nti si bwe kiri.
I don’t want to do this too much.	Kino saagala kukikola nnyo.
Not in this case.	Si mu mbeera eno.
You want to do it right away.	Oyagala kukikola amangu ddala.
I could hear everything.	Nnali mpulira buli kimu.
There is nothing in the car.	Tewali kintu kyonna mu mmotoka.
However, it is a good idea.	Kyokka, kirowoozo kirungi.
That may be the case.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
You won’t stay here long.	Tojja kumala wano bbanga ddene.
I have to think of nothing.	Nnina okulowooza ku kintu kyonna.
He is a man.	Ye musajja.
Not very good for you, in my opinion.	Si kirungi nnyo gyoli, mu ndowooza yange.
Give what you would like to receive.	Wa ekyo kye wandyagadde okufuna.
He is really good.	Ye mulungi ddala.
What he wanted.	Kye yali ayagala.
This is all .	Kino kyonna .
That was my plan for tonight.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka yange ekiro kino.
We really can win.	Ddala tusobola okuwangula.
You won’t have to say anything.	Tojja kuba na kwogera kintu kyonna.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
He will be down.	Ajja kuba wansi.
It’s not necessarily a bad thing.	Si kituufu nti kintu kibi.
She knew she would never see her boyfriend again.	Yali akimanyi nti tagenda kuddamu kulaba muganzi we.
I hope all of us.	Nsuubira ffenna.
I’ll be home all night.	Nja kubeera waka ekiro kyonna.
You are my reason.	Ggwe nsonga yange.
You're coming with me.	Ojja nange.
Like you and me.	Nga nze naawe.
I am sure this will never happen again.	Nkakasa nti kino tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
I feel a bit hungry.	Mpulira enjala katono.
He had everything he needed.	Yalina buli kye yeetaaga.
No one needed to say anything.	Tewali yali yeetaaga kwogera kintu kyonna.
I am blessed in so many ways.	Nnina omukisa mu ngeri nnyingi nnyo.
However, it is time to move on.	Kyokka, kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
You are not in that group right now.	Toli mu kibiina ekyo mu kiseera kino.
Or even a little bit.	Oba n’akatono.
No! 	Nedda!
You can do it here.	Osobola okukikola wano.
Very good, he said.	Kirungi nnyo, bwe yagambye.
Does that look good to you?.	Ekyo kirabika bulungi gyoli?.
But that’s not him at all.	Naye oyo si ye n’akatono.
However, not here.	Kyokka si wano.
Of course not, there is no such thing.	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri, tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
I can’t go back with him.	Sisobola kudda naye.
I hope it isn’t.	Nsuubira nti si bwe kiri.
Apparently that wasn’t the case.	Kirabika ekyo si bwe kyali.
Not much time.	Si budde bungi.
But no, that’s where it was.	Naye nedda, awo we kyali.
He wasn’t that young.	Yali si muto bw’atyo.
This will not work.	Kino tekijja kukola.
He just didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala kyokka.
Call the hospital.	Kuba essimu mu ddwaaliro.
Everyone was ready.	Buli omu yali mwetegefu.
Which isn’t really.	Nga si ddala.
He doesn’t go any closer.	Tagenda kumpi nnyo.
Of course, that’s true.	Kya lwatu, ekyo kituufu.
I can help a lot.	Nsobola okuyamba nnyo.
In a way, this is a really powerful idea.	Mu ngeri emu, eno ndowooza ya maanyi ddala.
He is a patient.	Ye mulwadde.
Any help please.	Obuyambi bwonna nsaba.
I wouldn’t know.	Nze wandibadde simanyi.
I want to get back to this process.	Njagala kudda ku nkola eno.
He was very thoughtful.	Yali alowooza nnyo.
Although, maybe not.	Wadde, mpozzi si bwe kiri.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
Same thing with this one.	Ekintu kye kimu ne ku kino.
You can just be you.	Osobola okubeera ggwe kyokka.
I think you’ll be able to do that.	Ndowooza ekyo ojja kusobola okukikola.
As he would have done.	Nga bwe yandikoze.
It was going to be so easy.	Kyali kigenda kuba kyangu nnyo.
I don’t know how to be a father.	Simanyi ngeri ya kubeera taata.
That's my point.	Eyo y'ensonga yange.
And he was very good.	Era yali mulungi nnyo.
I can absolutely.	Nsobola ddala.
However, that is not actually true.	Kyokka, mu butuufu ekyo si kituufu.
He obviously won’t go away.	Kya lwatu nti tagenda kugenda.
He couldn’t go.	Yali tasobola kugenda.
In the same room.	Mu kisenge kimu.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
When he was younger, I was all alone.	Bwe yali akyali muto, nnali nze nzekka.
He would need both of them.	Yandibadde yeetaaga bombi.
He is happy to do so.	Musanyufu okukikola.
I guess a lot.	Ntebereza bingi.
I do the reading.	Nkola okusoma.
He knows how to get what he wants.	Amanyi okufuna ky’ayagala.
I am realistic.	Nze ndi wa ddala.
Not this serious.	Si kino kya maanyi.
He seems to think it matters when.	Alabika alowooza nti kikulu ddi.
You're almost ready, he said.	Oli kumpi mwetegefu, bwe yagambye.
And he didn’t want to stay.	Era yali tayagala kusigala.
And yes, that’s great.	Era ye, ekyo kirungi nnyo.
This is a practical idea.	Eno ndowooza ya nkola.
But it really doesn’t matter.	Naye ddala si kikulu.
And that was the plan.	Era eyo ye yali enteekateeka.
Working as fast as we can.	Okukola mu bwangu nga bwe tusobola.
On here.	Ku wano.
You are happy all the time.	Oli musanyufu buli kiseera.
I love the food.	Njagala nnyo emmere.
I need to know if you are a good person.	Nnina okumanya oba oli muntu mulungi.
And that’s me.	Era oyo nze.
He is better than us.	Ye asinga ffe.
He is in good shape.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi.
You are too good for.	Oli mulungi nnyo eri...
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
There is something to them.	Waliwo ekintu gye bali.
But it’s nothing major.	Naye si kintu kyonna kikulu.
It’s all for you.	Byonna lwa ggwe.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I’m not going to be a doctor.	Sigenda kubeera musawo.
Not my boyfriend.	Si muganzi wange.
The food is excellent.	Emmere nnungi nnyo.
Not too early.	Si nga bukyali nnyo.
He is a strong man.	Musajja wa maanyi.
Tomorrow it could be you.	Enkya kiyinza okuba ggwe.
He was trying to talk.	Yali agezaako okwogera.
Everything looking good.	Buli kimu nga kirabika bulungi.
It goes on a lot in prison, that.	Kigenda mu maaso nnyo mu kkomera, nti.
We don’t have any of that.	Tetulina na kimu ku ebyo.
You’re going to do that anyway.	Ekyo ogenda kukikola mu ngeri yonna.
You know how he was.	Omanyi bwe yali.
However, it was wrong.	Kyokka, kyali kibi.
For a while now.	Okumala akaseera kati.
But, and this is important.	Naye, era kino kikulu.
He certainly didn’t know he was coming.	Mazima ddala yali tamanyi nti yali ajja.
He was like that.	Yali bw’atyo.
That’s my point really.	Eyo y’ensonga yange ddala.
We have no power.	Tetulina maanyi.
As if it is nothing.	Nga bwe kiri nti si kintu kyonna.
You at any given time.	Ggwe mu kiseera kyonna.
This is not always the case.	Kino si bwe kiri bulijjo.
I had no time at all.	Nnali sirina budde bwonna n’akatono.
Or you can do it today.	Oba oyinza okukikola leero.
But he was thinking too.	Naye naye yali alowooza.
Or anyone else for that matter.	Oba omuntu omulala yenna ku nsonga eyo.
It’s not just me, though.	Si nze nzekka, naye.
But he had during the week.	Naye yalina mu wiiki.
You are beautiful.	Oli mulungi.
But he was already gone.	Naye yali yagenda dda.
He is a good man.	Ye musajja mulungi.
Someone can help.	Waliwo asobola okuyamba.
It was for all he did not know.	Kyali lwa byonna bye yali tamanyi.
I hope that’s not the case.	Nsuubira nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
That seems about all we can do.	Ekyo kirabika nga ku byonna bye tusobola okukola.
He said he didn’t know.	Yagamba nti tamanyi.
No, he said, he wasn't.	Nedda, yagamba, si bwe yali.
I think he knows that.	Ndowooza ekyo akimanyi.
Whether you like it or not is up to you.	Oba oyagala oba nedda kiri gy’oli.
Will be any time now.	Ajja kuba essaawa yonna kati.
He is not a thinker.	Si ye muntu alowooza.
You could do something like this.	Oyinza okukola ekintu nga kino.
I’m a man.	Nze ndi musajja.
Why, he had no idea.	Lwaki, yali talina kirowoozo kyonna.
He did this now.	Kino yakikola kati.
He had always thought so.	Bulijjo yali alowooza bw’atyo.
He was a very nice guy.	Yali ggaayi mulungi nnyo.
He couldn't say any of that.	Yali tasobola kwogera kintu kyonna ku ebyo.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera.
We are very much with him.	Tuli naye nnyo.
But he is the only one.	Naye ye yekka.
You will gain strength.	Ojja kufuna amaanyi.
And he is my teacher.	Era ye musomesa wange.
I don't know.	Simanyi.
There is no power play.	Tewali kuzannya maanyi.
No, that’s true.	Nedda, ekyo kituufu.
This seems to be happening.	Kino kirabika nga kigenda mu maaso.
This is his job.	Guno gwe mulimu gwe.
You were always you too.	Bulijjo naawe wali ggwe.
I have an office.	Nnina ofiisi.
It was my routine.	Kyali nkola yange.
That’s how he was doing.	Bw’atyo bwe yali akola.
We’re there in the car.	Tuli awo mu mmotoka.
He knows what we have what we need.	Amanyi kye tulina kye twetaaga.
I love this movie.	Njagala nnyo firimu eno.
He has a lot.	Alina bingi.
It is probably very important.	Oboolyawo kikulu nnyo.
It’s not human.	Si kya muntu.
You don’t know what he was like.	Tomanyi bwe yali.
Everything but me.	Buli kimu okuggyako nze.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Nnali simanyi ngeri ya kukikola.
Or this week.	Oba wiiki eno.
Everything is the same.	Buli kimu kiri kimu.
Is it just me, or is this normal?.	Nze nzekka, oba kino kya bulijjo?.
Now it’s commonplace.	Kati kya bulijjo.
It's just all over the place.	Kiri mu kifo kyonna kyokka.
Those things	Ebintu ebyo .
Things like that.	Ebintu nga ebyo.
But it’s really none of my business.	Naye ddala si nsonga yange yonna.
He knew he was safe.	Yali akimanyi nti talina bulabe.
You go all out.	Ggwe ogenda byonna.
Any way back to the point.	Engeri yonna okudda ku nsonga.
He is a very, very strong man.	Musajja wa maanyi nnyo nnyo.
He told me that much.	Yangamba bingi ebyo.
He didn’t even know where they were.	Yali tamanyi na gye baali.
It is very important to us.	Kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
But one can come back to that.	Naye omuntu asobola okudda ku nsonga eyo.
This is the one.	Oyo ye ye.
That’s what’s important here.	Ekyo kye kikulu wano.
But I .	Naye nze .
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
You will have to .	Ojja kuba olina okubeera .
That will be me.	Ekyo kijja kuba nze.
He was very thoughtful.	Yali alowooza nnyo.
Almost, this is very difficult.	Kumpi, kino kizibu nnyo.
But it was a good place.	Naye kyali kifo kirungi.
I hope my luck is good.	Nsuubira omukisa gwange mulungi.
It is very easy to drive fast.	Kyangu nnyo okuvuga amangu.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
He didn’t want to do that.	Ekyo yali tayagala kukikola.
We have to do this.	Kino tulina okukikola.
We have to move forward.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso.
But in the meantime.	Naye mu kiseera kino.
It was my everything.	Kyali buli kimu kyange.
But to him.	Naye eri ye.
But he was curious.	Naye yali ayagala okumanya.
I know immediately what it is.	Nze mmanyi mangu kye kiri.
One, and together.	Omu, era nga bali wamu.
That will never happen again.	Ekyo tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
No, that’s true.	Nedda, ekyo kituufu.
Winning was easy.	Okuwangula kyali kyangu.
I don’t know if you know that or not.	Simanyi oba ekyo okimanyi oba nedda.
And it was great to do.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo okukola.
But it’s pretty cool.	Naye nga kirungi nnyo.
That’s mostly true.	Ekyo okusinga kituufu.
This arrangement would work.	Enteekateeka eno yandikoze.
Nobody does that.	Ekyo tewali akikola.
Everything is fine.	Buli kintu kiri bulungi.
Maybe it was him.	Mpozzi nga ye yali.
But he was already gone.	Naye yali yagenda dda.
No organization at all.	Tewali kibiina n’akatono.
It was absolutely true.	Kyali kituufu ddala.
Now he’s the one.	Kati y’ali.
No one can.	Tewali asobola.
He does everything in His time.	Buli kimu akikola mu kiseera kye.
At this point, they were very real to me.	Mu kiseera kino, baali ba ddala nnyo gyendi.
I'll agree.	Nja kukkiriza.
He was here himself.	Ye kennyini yali wano.
Really good though.	Ddala kirungi wadde.
To all of us.	Eri ffenna.
This is where you should be up to.	Wano we wandibadde okubeera okutuuka.
Glad you’re here.	Musanyufu nti oli wano.
And he was the only one.	Era ye yali yekka.
You have to move on.	Olina okugenda mu maaso.
He had to go now.	Yalina okugenda kati.
Now it’s time to strike.	Kati kye kiseera okukuba.
No one does it quite like that.	Tewali akikola bw’atyo ddala.
He couldn’t see down.	Yali tasobola kulaba wansi.
Here you go.	Wano ogenda.
Why did no one think this would happen.	Lwaki tewali yalowooza nti kino kijja kubaawo.
But it’s definitely power.	Naye ddala maanyi.
Like everyone else, he knew it.	Nga buli muntu omulala, naye yali akimanyi.
More than he could have imagined.	Okusinga bwe yali asobola okulowooza.
I just want to be happy with you.	Njagala kubeera musanyufu naawe kyokka.
Everyone was trying hard.	Buli omu yali agezaako nnyo.
But it was for good reason.	Naye kyali kya nsonga nnungi.
Or you want to.	Oba oyagala.
This seems to be the answer.	Kino kirabika nga kya kuddamu.
And that’s what’s important.	Era ekyo kye kikulu.
I need a little bit more to go on.	Nze nneetaaga katono nnyo okugenda mu maaso.
He wanted to know now.	Yali ayagala okumanya kati.
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
He doesn’t want to do that.	Ekyo tayagala kukikola.
You will win.	Ojja kuwangula.
You don’t have to, but you can’t.	Tolina kukikola, naye tosobola kukikola.
He really does.	Akola ddala.
He knew about you.	Yali amanyi ku ggwe.
It could be a picture.	Kiyinza okuba ekifaananyi.
It was truly a powerful experience.	Mazima ddala kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
They are really powerful.	Ddala ba maanyi.
He tried anyway.	Yagezaako mu ngeri yonna.
He is in good shape.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi.
I don’t know if he can think of such a thing.	Simanyi oba asobola okulowooza ku kintu ng’ekyo.
Maybe we were too busy.	Mpozzi twali bbize nnyo.
So is the movie.	Bwatyo ne firimu.
But that wasn’t it at all.	Naye ekyo si kye kyali n’akatono.
I certainly can’t.	Mazima ddala sisobola.
But nothing matters.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna kikulu.
However, I want to be real.	Kyokka njagala kubeera wa ddala.
This is not a good practice.	Eno si nkola nnungi.
Early in the morning.	Bukyali ku makya ennyo.
And yet he wasn’t.	Era naye si bwe yali.
In many ways this is true.	Mu ngeri nnyingi kino kituufu.
Definitely, definitely not.	Mazima ddala, mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
It’s what they were.	Kye kye baali.
We will go everywhere together.	Tujja kugenda wamu buli wamu.
Such a thing can happen.	Ekintu ng’ekyo kiyinza okubaawo.
I was fine with it.	Nze nali bulungi.
You will be very beautiful.	Ojja kuba mulungi nnyo.
While on his own time.	Nga ali ku budde bwe.
I don’t know what time it is.	Nze simanyi ssaawa ki.
It was just here.	Kyali wano wekka.
He does what he wants.	Akola ky’ayagala.
It was something.	Yali kintu.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Era si kibi.
Too many nights in jail.	Ekiro bingi nnyo mu kkomera.
But that was also the problem.	Naye era ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
And there are no cars.	Era tewali mmotoka.
He talked to me a bit.	Yayogera nange katono.
But it is also, so much more.	Naye era kiri, bingi nnyo.
He can’t do it there.	Tasobola kukikola eyo.
However, that is not the case.	Kyokka, ekyo si bwe kiri.
He was a guy.	Yali ggaayi.
But not at the office.	Naye si ku ofiisi.
He’s going to be just fine.	Agenda kuba bulungi nnyo.
It’s time to speak up.	Kye kiseera okwogera.
Or that’s what he told me.	Oba ekyo kye yang’amba.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
Here is an issue for you.	Wano waliwo ensonga gy’oli.
You can live on me.	Osobola okubeera ku nze.
It was a beautiful late afternoon.	Yali nnungi nnyo akawungeezi akawungeezi.
You are the one.	Ggwe oli omu.
We need to talk to him about it.	Tulina okwogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
I think we have to get out of this place.	Ndowooza tulina okuva mu kifo kino.
He goes down very quickly.	Agenda wansi mangu nnyo.
Which he didn’t have.	Kye yali talina.
That's why it's so good.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki kirungi nnyo.
We'll talk.	Tujja kwogera.
What a beautiful morning it would be .	Nga enkya yandibadde nnungi .
Now every day.	Kati buli lunaku.
Nothing is more important than that.	Tewali kintu kikulu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
But it’s really up to you.	Naye ddala kiri gy’oli.
That is very common.	Ekyo kya bulijjo nnyo.
In one hour.	Mu ssaawa emu.
He loved the house.	Yali ayagala nnyo ennyumba eyo.
You certainly don’t want to do that.	Mazima ddala ekyo toyagala kukikola.
He knows where everything is.	Amanyi buli kimu we kiri.
That was the problem I had.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu kye nnali nfunye.
You have no place here.	Wano tolina kifo.
I may have known it wouldn’t work.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnali nkimanyi nti tekijja kukola.
I didn’t know what to expect.	Nnali simanyi kye nnali nsuubira.
I couldn’t do this now.	Kino nnali sisobola kukikola kati.
He wants to win right away.	Ayagala kuwangula mangu ddala.
He began to speak.	Yatandika okwogera.
This is going to happen.	Kino kigenda mu maaso.
She knew he knew it.	Yali akimanyi nti akimanyi.
To be with you.	Okubeera naawe.
This is a very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
He had to get home.	Yalina okutuuka awaka.
Each of us said what we would do.	Buli omu ku ffe yayogera kye yandikoze.
But it was very difficult.	Naye kyali kizibu nnyo.
It was his idea really.	Kyali kirowoozo kye ddala.
I love it actually.	Njagala nnyo mu butuufu.
There is no mind at work.	Tewali ndowooza eri ku mulimu.
I can’t do it tomorrow.	Sisobola kukikola enkya.
I both can and will.	Nze ffembi nsobola era nja kukikola.
It doesn’t seem to be true.	Kirabika si kituufu.
He has already gone on too long.	Abadde yagenda mu maaso dda ebbanga ddene nnyo.
Your plan worked.	Enteekateeka yo yakola.
Maybe he’ll have dinner with me.	Mpozzi ajja kulya nange ekyeggulo.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
It is very important right now.	Kikulu nnyo mu kiseera kino.
This was easy.	Kino kyali kyangu.
I think this is a good practice.	Ndowooza eno nkola nnungi.
And my brother is .	Era muganda wange ye .
This really seems so simple.	Kino ddala kirabika nga kyangu nnyo.
It was just there.	Kyali awo kyokka.
But no, it's my classroom.	Naye nedda, kye kibiina kyange.
However, not much.	Kyokka, si bingi.
I want a picture.	Njagala ekifaananyi.
That was a great answer.	Ekyo kyali kya kuddamu kirungi nnyo.
I just want to be there.	Njagala kubeerawo kyokka.
We were almost in town now.	Twali kumpi okutuuka mu kibuga kati.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
No, you were probably in a hurry.	Nedda, oboolyawo wali mu bwangu.
But it’s not just one.	Naye si kimu kyokka.
Nothing is happening in my place.	Tewali kigenda mu maaso mu kifo kyange.
He was still human.	Yali akyali muntu.
And that was probably a good thing.	Era ekyo oboolyawo kyali kirungi.
What a lovely man he is.	Nga musajja ayagala nnyo.
This is really important.	Kino kikulu nnyo ddala.
I was sure now.	Nali nkakasa kati.
That seems to be the case.	Ekyo kirabika kye kiri.
He as he said so.	Ye nga bwe yagamba bw’atyo.
He loves this thing.	Ayagala nnyo ekintu kino.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
And that’s not .	Era ekyo si .
For each of us.	Ku lwa buli omu ku ffe.
Not either, or.	Si oba, oba.
But it’s mine too.	Naye naye wange.
No, this is definitely not a good plan.	Nedda, eno mazima ddala si nteekateeka nnungi.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
I am very happy to be here.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano.
It would be nice to stay a little longer.	Kyandibadde kirungi okumala akaseera katono.
I wasn’t sure myself.	Nze kennyini nnali sikakasa.
Almost every day, in fact.	Kumpi buli lunaku, mu butuufu.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
Now he was really doing it.	Kati yali akikola ddala.
And in the	Ne mu .
I want to win.	Njagala kuwangula.
And you will know.	Era ojja kumanya.
I just know what it is now.	Nze mmanyi kyokka kye kiri kati.
And that’s normal.	Era ekyo kya bulijjo.
That wasn’t what it was.	Ekyo si kye kyali.
This is a practice.	Eno nkola.
I am very much alone right now.	Nze ndi nzekka nnyo mu kiseera kino.
You're good there.	Oli mulungi eyo.
Everyone but him.	Buli muntu okuggyako ye.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
It's not you.	Si ggwe.
Either one or the other.	Oba omu oba omulala.
I’m not good enough.	Nze siri mulungi.
They certainly are.	Mazima bwe bali.
And on, and on.	Era ku, ne ku.
I didn’t know where to go.	Nnali simanyi gye nnyinza kugenda.
I wanted to tell everyone tonight.	Nnali njagala okubuulira buli muntu ekiro kino.
This weekend is homecoming.	Wiikendi eno ya kudda waka.
I’m doing fine.	Nze nkola bulungi.
You have to see.	Olina okulaba.
I was alone.	Nnali nzekka.
And he is definitely not home.	Era mazima ddala tali waka.
It’s really quite simple, too.	Ddala kyangu nnyo, era.
What was that? 	Ekyo kyali ki?
But that wasn’t all it could do.	Naye ekyo si kye kyokka kye kyali kiyinza okukola.
This was easy.	Kino kyali kyangu.
Back in the room.	Okudda mu kisenge.
Maybe he did.	Mpozzi nga yakikola.
He had a job.	Yalina omulimu.
Preaching is much harder to do the same.	Okubuulira kizibu nnyo okukola kye kimu.
No, not one.	Nedda, si emu.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
But there isn’t.	Naye tewali.
He felt like he belonged.	Yawulira nga ye wa.
No one said anything.	Tewali yayogera kintu kyonna.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
You can do it now.	Osobola okukikola kati.
And the same thing with the city.	Era ekintu kye kimu ne ku kibuga.
He certainly wanted to.	Mazima ddala yali ayagala.
His work is everything.	Omulimu gwe buli kimu.
I wanted to.	Nnali njagala.
I won’t go home.	Sijja kudda waka.
It’s one reason among many.	Y’ensonga emu mu nnyingi.
True, but not quite all.	Kituufu, naye si byonna ddala.
But he was no ordinary man.	Naye yali si muntu wa bulijjo.
Probably right now when there was nothing, he thought.	Oboolyawo mu kiseera kino nga tewali kintu kyonna, bwe yalowooza.
That's how it seems to me.	Bwatyo bwe kirabika gyendi.
I am being real now.	Nze ndi kubeera wa ddala kati.
That is very simple and easy to do.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo era kyangu okukola.
In fact, he was.	Mu butuufu, yali.
You're fine.	Oli bulungi.
This phenomenon is completely normal.	Ekintu kino kya bulijjo ddala.
While this is certainly good, it can be very difficult.	Wadde nga kino mazima ddala kirungi, kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
An ordinary guy.	Ggaayi wa bulijjo.
He wanted to know about everything.	Yali ayagala okumanya ku buli kimu.
You will love it so much.	Ojja kwagala nnyo nnyo.
He had been in the room.	Yali abadde mu kisenge.
I don’t know how to do that.	Ekyo simanyi ngeri ya kukikola.
How lucky we are.	Nga tuli ba mukisa.
In fact, that’s not the case at all.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
He said no, he didn’t want to eat.	Yagamba nti nedda, yali tayagala kulya.
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
You’re not ready.	Toli mwetegefu.
Like, he really loves it.	Nga, ddala ayagala nnyo.
You can hit tomorrow.	Osobola okukuba enkya.
He's a little younger.	Ali muto katono.
Of course, it was true.	Kya lwatu, kyali kituufu.
Until we can do that.	Okutuusa nga tusobola okukola ekyo.
You always have on this option.	Bulijjo olina ku nkola eno.
I couldn’t see very clearly.	Nnali sisobola kulaba bulungi nnyo.
But he’s done.	Naye amaze.
But something is obviously going on.	Naye kya lwatu nti waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
You know, the dog.	Omanyi, embwa.
Now I’m not ready to go.	Kati siri mwetegefu kugenda.
It was good for me too.	Nange kyali kirungi gyendi.
I want to know why.	Njagala okumanya lwaki.
And he had to do it.	Era yalina okukikola.
That is the problem we have here.	Ekyo kye kizibu kye tulina wano.
This is very fortunate.	Kino kya mukisa nnyo.
That’s exactly what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri ddala.
You have to work .	Olina okukola .
He hoped there wasn't.	Yalina essuubi nti tewali.
He didn’t want her help.	Yali tayagala buyambi bwe.
I love cars.	Njagala nnyo mmotoka.
Really, you should.	Ddala, wandibadde okola.
Why, we have no idea.	Lwaki, tetulina kirowoozo kyonna.
But there is no police.	Naye tewali poliisi.
Strength, we have to address this issue today.	Amaanyi, tulina okukola ku nsonga eno leero.
And you might be too.	Era naawe oyinza okuba.
I’m not there for them either.	Nze nange siri gye bali.
Living in the moment.	Okubeera mu kiseera kino.
I could see everything.	Nnali nsobola okulaba buli kimu.
I have the money.	Nnina ssente.
That's why he does it.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki akikola.
I'll go soon.	Nja kugenda mangu.
He is a patient.	Ye mulwadde.
Maybe it was true.	Mpozzi nga kyali kituufu.
Someone is always on his case.	Bulijjo waliwo abeera ku nsonga ye.
It can be powerful.	Kiyinza okuba nga kya maanyi.
It doesn’t matter who.	Si kikulu ani.
No, it is not.	Nedda si bwe kiri.
I really don’t know what to do now.	Mazima ddala simanyi kya kukola kati.
You don’t have to spend a little more than you want.	Tolina kumala katono okusinga ku ky’oyagala.
My father was at home.	Taata yali waka.
Someone takes a picture.	Waliwo akuba ekifaananyi.
What a terrible thing.	Nga kibi nnyo.
I was always convinced of that, even then.	Ekyo bulijjo nnali nkakasa, ne mu kiseera ekyo.
What a beautiful car.	Nga mmotoka nnungi nnyo.
He felt empty.	Yawulira nga talina kintu kyonna.
He is almost a man.	Kumpi abeera musajja.
You are a blessing to us.	Oli mukisa gye tuli.
I thought you .	Nalowooza nti ggwe .
Now it’s here.	Kati kiri wano.
We are moving forward very quickly.	Tugenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
That’s not really true.	Ekyo mu butuufu si kituufu.
Maybe he should go.	Mpozzi yandibadde agenda.
And he knows it.	Era akimanyi.
He was asleep.	Yali yeebase.
He had every reason to do it.	Yalina ensonga yonna lwaki yakikola.
Most likely he will go.	Okusinga ajja kugenda.
He loved everyone.	Yali ayagala nnyo buli muntu.
I couldn’t be happier.	Nnali siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo.
I can’t believe that fact.	Siyinza kukkiriza nsonga eyo.
He didn’t want to be with her.	Yali tayagala kubeera naye.
It will be much easier.	Kijja kuba kyangu nnyo.
I will stay on this.	Nja kusigala ku kino.
There’s a movie.	Waliwo firimu.
It was good for me.	Kyali kirungi gyendi.
He was more than good.	Yali asinga ku bulungi.
I have to stay for a long time.	Nnina okumala ebbanga ddene.
Or on you.	Oba ku ggwe.
It’s time for me .	Kye kiseera nze .
We were in the same place.	Twali mu kifo kye kimu.
You can never tell the truth.	Tosobola kwogera mazima n’akatono.
He would have to do it himself.	Yandibadde alina okukikola ye kennyini.
This is what we needed to know.	Kino kye twali tulina okumanya.
He was a man’s man.	Yali musajja wa musajja.
But not really.	Naye si ddala.
But that is not the truth.	Naye ekyo si kye kituufu.
He was that fast like that.	Yali wa bwangu bw’atyo bw’atyo.
And he was her friend.	Era yali mukwano gwe.
My father has no money.	Taata talina ssente.
It’s hard for a book to do that.	Kizibu ekitabo okukola ekyo.
Tomorrow is the day.	Enkya lwe lunaku.
And yes, it was me.	Era ye, nnali nze.
He should have been here today.	Yandibadde wano leero.
He really didn't know what to do.	Mazima ddala yali tamanyi kya kukola.
However, it seems very important.	Kyokka, kirabika kikulu nnyo.
Of course, he can.	Kya lwatu nti asobola.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He will go with you.	Ajja kugenda naawe.
You know what that thing is.	Omanyi ekintu ekyo kye kiri.
Right now it doesn’t matter.	Mu kiseera kino si kikulu.
My girlfriend, my best friend, and myself.	Muganzi wange, mukwano gwange omulungi, nange kennyini.
He was willing to do all of this.	Yali mwetegefu okukola bino byonna.
He says that is not true.	Agamba nti ekyo si kituufu.
I think that’s a really powerful one.	Ndowooza eyo ddala ya maanyi.
And this is not unusual though.	Era kino si kya bulijjo wadde.
It's a good idea, you know.	Kirowoozo kirungi omanyi.
It’s not a force.	Si maanyi.
But now he was alone.	Naye kati yali yekka.
Must be willing, strong.	Ateekwa okuba nga mwetegefu, nga wa maanyi.
It's there to help.	Kiri awo okuyamba.
Surely someone has wanted this before.	Mazima ddala waliwo abadde ayagala kino emabegako.
However, this is not true.	Naye, kino si kituufu.
There is absolutely no harm.	Tewali bulabe ddala.
That was all he was to them.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali gye bali.
He won’t know.	Tajja kumanya.
We should be there.	Tusaanidde okuba awo.
For us this is not the case.	Ffe kino si bwe kiri.
Of course, it’s nothing like that.	Kya lwatu, si kintu ng’ekyo.
I wanted to get ahead in my career.	Nnali njagala okugenda mu maaso mu mulimu gwange.
I’m the police.	Nze poliisi.
Allowed .	Yakkiriza .
All night long.	Ekiro kyonna.
It’s hard to see.	Kizibu okulaba.
He speaks very well.	Ayogera bulungi nnyo.
I hope no one does.	Nsuubira nti tewali muntu yenna akola.
We can’t do that.	Ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
He doesn’t really have anything.	Mu butuufu talina ky’alina.
My father was asleep.	Taata yali yeebase.
We don’t have more time than we need.	Tetulina budde bungi okusinga bwe twetaaga.
It’s a good thing.	Kintu kirungi.
He knew he would.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
But this was obviously urgent.	Naye kino kya lwatu nti kyali kya mangu.
There is no place here.	Wano tewali kifo.
And that was basically all he wanted.	Era okusinga ekyo kyokka kye yali ayagala.
He made a picture.	Yakola ekifaananyi.
He wasn’t coming.	Yali tajja.
I wanted to talk to you.	Nnali njagala okwogera naawe.
He knew where he had to go.	Yali amanyi gye yalina okugenda.
We’re going next week.	Tugenda wiiki ejja.
And that was true at the time.	Era ekyo kyali kituufu mu kiseera ekyo.
But it’s not money.	Naye si ssente.
Much the same as today.	Ekintu kye kimu nnyo nga bwe kiri leero.
I certainly know this in myself.	Mazima ddala kino nkimanyi mu nze.
Everything is going to be fine.	Buli kimu kigenda kuba bulungi.
He didn't know the answer.	Yali tamanyi kya kuddamu.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
Same thing with movies.	Ekintu kye kimu ne firimu.
We were friends now.	Twali ba mukwano kati.
He obviously knew it.	Kya lwatu yali akimanyi.
He is good to me.	Ye mulungi gyendi.
You can’t do that.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola.
You’re not alone.	Si ggwe wekka.
She is a very nice lady.	Mukyala mulungi nnyo.
He didn't want to, but he had to.	Yali tayagala, naye yalina okukikola.
We really needed to talk.	Twali twetaaga nnyo okwogera.
There was nowhere.	Tewali we wali.
We just have each other.	Tulina buli omu yekka.
We need to move quickly on this.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso mu bwangu ku nsonga eno.
I know you want to know.	Nkimanyi nti oyagala okumanya.
And of course, everyone knows that.	Era kya lwatu, buli muntu ekyo akimanyi.
That’s too bad for you.	Ekyo kibi nnyo gyoli.
He must be here, right here.	Ateekwa okuba wano, wano ddala.
I couldn’t talk to anyone.	Nnali sisobola kwogera na muntu yenna.
And neither will you.	Era naawe tojja kukikola.
Not as it is.	Si nga bwe kiri.
But, but .	Naye, naye .
either.	oba.
It’s awful, and it’s powerful.	Kibi nnyo, era kya maanyi nnyo.
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo .
The hunger was intense, of course.	Enjala yali ya maanyi, ddala.
What he would do.	Kye yandikoze.
Most likely to happen.	Okusinga okubaawo.
Always in the morning.	Bulijjo ku makya.
He knew who he was.	Yali amanyi ani gwe yali.
Like a picture.	Nga ekifaananyi.
He has to go back to office.	Alina okudda mu ofiisi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
We need so many things.	Twetaaga ebintu bingi nnyo.
But he's on to something.	Naye ali ku kintu.
I am not in a very good mood.	Siri mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
I don’t know if we can win.	Simanyi oba tusobola okuwangula.
I just knew it.	Nze nnali mmanyi kyokka.
But he didn’t want that.	Naye ekyo yali tayagala.
He had his job and all.	Yalina omulimu gwe ne byonna.
Everyone is in place.	Buli omu ali mu kifo.
That was all he knew for sure.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali amanyi bulungi.
He must have had help.	Ateekwa okuba nga yalina obuyambi.
He did absolutely.	Yakikola ddala.
No, that one.	Nedda, oyo.
He didn’t want to go with her.	Yali tayagala kugenda naye.
I don’t really have a plan.	Mu butuufu sirina nteekateeka.
I hope next week is better.	Nsuubira nti wiiki ejja ejja kuba nnungi.
I don’t have my phone.	Essimu yange sirina.
What a difficult thing.	Nga kizibu nnyo.
He slept through the night.	Yeebase ekiro kyonna.
It is very accurate.	Kituufu nnyo.
But we are close.	Naye tuli kumpi.
But he’s not going to do it.	Naye tagenda kukikola.
He does it.	Akikola.
It's all you.	Byonna ggwe.
And we can’t do that.	Era ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
Everyone here is friendly.	Buli muntu wano wa mukwano.
He didn’t know anyone there.	Yali talina muntu yenna amanyi eyo.
And not in a good way.	Era si mu ngeri nnungi.
However, I think we have time.	Kyokka ndowooza nti tulina obudde.
Everything would be fine.	Buli kimu kyandibadde kirungi.
Apparently .	Kirabika .
I have to win.	Nnina okuwangula.
No one talks to my father.	Tewali ayogera ne taata.
There is nothing wrong with them.	Tewali kibi kyonna gye bali.
He needed a job.	Yali yeetaaga omulimu.
Already doing everything.	Okukola dda buli kimu.
That was the way, of course.	Eyo ye yali engeri, ddala.
However, that was fine.	Kyokka, ekyo kyali kirungi.
And happy, now.	Era musanyufu, kati.
No one would have known where he had been.	Tewali yandibadde amanyi gye yali abadde.
That's why we're here.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
We need energy.	Twetaaga amaanyi.
He started talking to me again.	Yatandika okuddamu okwogera nange.
Not in time.	Si mu budde.
Nothing is happening now.	Tewali kigenda mu maaso kati.
Or it may do nothing at all.	Oba kiyinza obutakola kintu kyonna n’akatono.
He will be mine.	Ajja kuba wange.
He was in an office.	Yali mu ofiisi emu.
We are kind of .	Tuli mu ngeri ya .
And maybe he was trying too hard, as well.	Era mpozzi yali agezaako nnyo, nga bwe kiri.
I know he won’t.	Nkimanyi nti tajja kukikola.
But that’s not a bad thing.	Naye ekyo si kibi.
He didn't know why now.	Yali tamanyi lwaki kati.
I was very happy with this.	Kino nnali musanyufu nnyo.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
Both are not the same.	Bombi si kye kimu.
It seems so long ago.	Kirabika dda nnyo.
And we were going out a lot for dinner.	Era twali tugenda nnyo okulya ekyeggulo.
I'll be here.	Nja kuba wano.
That is not the case at all.	Ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
This seems to be true.	Kino kirabika nga kituufu.
I will be strong.	Nja kuba wa maanyi.
His brother was like that.	Muganda we bwe yali.
You can do it, baby.	Osobola okukikola mwana wange.
He knew he should have done it.	Yali akimanyi nti yandibadde akikola.
He is really sick.	Ddala mulwadde.
But you already know this.	Naye kino okimanyi dda.
He was not sick at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali si mulwadde.
I very nearly did it, too.	Nze kumpi nnyo okukikola, nange.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
But there was one thing he could do.	Naye waliwo ekintu kimu kye yali asobola okukola.
I don’t know where it is now.	Simanyi gye kiri kati.
I don't know exactly.	Nze simanyi bulungi.
In fact, he had to.	Mu butuufu, yalina okukikola.
I'll try to talk to him tonight, though.	Nja kugezaako okwogera naye ekiro kino, wadde.
Probably not, but maybe.	Oboolyawo si bwe kiri, naye mpozzi.
And you will do it.	Era ojja kukikola.
He told me that, himself.	Ekyo yangamba, ye kennyini.
He just wasn’t.	Ye yekka si bwe yali.
He was my friend.	Yali mukwano gwange.
He said he wanted the truth.	Yagambye nti ayagala mazima.
There was a reason he left.	Waliwo ensonga lwaki yagenda.
Now he is ready.	Kati mwetegefu.
That’s the man.	Oyo ye musajja.
There is no city.	Tewali kibuga.
And he wanted to go home.	Era yali ayagala kudda waka.
It’s not even an issue.	Si wadde ensonga.
Indeed, he did not know how to act.	Mazima ddala, yali tamanyi ngeri ya kukola.
That’s pretty good for us.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo gye tuli.
Anything but nothing.	Ekintu kyonna naye nga tewali.
He was always happy.	Bulijjo yali musanyufu.
I was thinking like you.	Nze nali ndowooza nga ggwe.
You know best.	Ggwe asinga okumanya.
Perfect for the office.	Kituufu nnyo ku ofiisi.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
This was very good indeed.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo ddala.
We can both be safe.	Ffembi tusobola okuba nga tetulina bulabe.
Not his money.	Si ssente ze.
You will just be an ordinary person.	Ojja kuba muntu wa bulijjo yekka.
But already you have a problem.	Naye dda olina obuzibu.
He won’t talk to anyone.	Tajja kwogera na muntu yenna.
We need goodness.	Twetaaga obulungi.
It’s very dangerous there.	Kya bulabe nnyo eyo.
He is certainly not ordinary.	Mazima ddala si wa bulijjo.
It’s not easy.	Si kya bwangu.
Something like .	Ekintu nga .
Although very low.	Wadde nga wa wansi nnyo.
It’s not just that.	Si ekyo kyokka.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
An hour drive from here.	Okuva wano okuvuga essaawa emu.
So far, it’s good.	N’okutuusa kati, kirungi.
A lot, probably.	Bingi, oboolyawo.
That's why it's important.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki kikulu.
I think that’s normal.	Ndowooza ekyo kya bulijjo.
Not for everyone.	Si lwa buli muntu.
I, at the time.	Nze, mu kiseera ekyo.
This is a good thing.	Kino kirungi.
I'll be back here tomorrow.	Nja kudda wano enkya.
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
But he isn’t like that.	Naye ye si bw’atyo.
Expensive but good.	Ya ssente nnyingi naye nga nnungi.
I can't go.	Sisobola kugenda.
He doesn't really know how to go about it.	Mu butuufu tamanyi ngeri ya kugenda mu maaso ku nsonga eno.
We should mention that this is not uncommon.	Tusaanidde okwogera nti kino si kya bulijjo.
Better than comfortable.	Kirungi okusinga okubeera obulungi.
No one will answer.	Tewali ajja kuddamu.
As he knew .	Nga bwe yali amanyi .
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
I know someone who is currently in prison.	Nze mmanyi omuntu ali mu kkomera mu kiseera kino.
It is a matter of urgency.	Ensonga ya bwangu.
It was a really intense experience.	Ddala kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
Or work at all.	Oba okukola n’akatono.
It really really isn’t.	Ddala ddala si bwe kiri.
He did a good job.	Yakola omulimu mulungi.
Whether you like it or not.	Oba oyagala oba toyagala.
But now it’s time to move on.	Naye kati kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
My father was happy.	Taata yali musanyufu.
Everything you want or need is right there.	Buli kintu ky’oyagala oba ky’oyagala kiri awo ddala.
It 's really	Ddala ye .
I wanted to be anything but human.	Nnali njagala kubeera kintu kyonna okuggyako omuntu.
I am not sure if that is the truth.	Sikakasa oba ekyo kye kituufu.
He wants a picture.	Ayagala ekifaananyi.
I’ll find someone better.	Nja kufuna omuntu omulungi.
Let him do what he wanted.	Akole kye yali ayagala.
No one knows anything.	Tewali amanyi kintu kyonna.
I have .	Nze alina .
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola.
I really, really like it, actually.	Njagala nnyo, nnyo, mu butuufu.
You have to go back to school tomorrow.	Olina okudda ku ssomero enkya.
It would be nice.	Kyandibadde kirungi.
But, he didn’t need to.	Naye, yali teyeetaaga.
And he should have.	Era yandibadde.
Obviously, this is not a terrible thing.	Kya lwatu nti kino si kintu kibi nnyo.
He didn’t know what he expected to find.	Yali tamanyi kye yali asuubira kufuna.
But is that true?.	Naye ekyo kituufu?.
But we have to go.	Naye tulina okugenda.
He just wants to be around her.	Ayagala kubeera kumpi naye yekka.
Now it is not.	Kati si bwe kiri.
. . . .	.
The help he did.	Obuyambi bwe yakola.
But you have to see.	Naye olina okulaba.
Perhaps we are.	Oboolyawo bwe tuli.
This was all he had.	Kino kyokka kye yali alina.
Why, he could do this every day.	Lwaki, kino yali asobola okukikola buli lunaku.
No one is very happy.	Tewali musanyufu nnyo.
But he dealt with his sin.	Naye yakola ku kibi kye.
And he needed all the help he could get.	Era yali yeetaaga obuyambi bwonna bwe yali asobola okufuna.
It doesn’t matter where.	Si kikulu wa.
Nobody does that.	Ekyo tewali akikola.
He needed to go almost immediately.	Yali yeetaaga okugenda kumpi mu bwangu.
Certainly not this.	Mazima ddala si kino.
I couldn’t believe it at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sisobola kukkiriza.
For almost anything.	Kumpi ku buli kintu kyonna.
I want to live in that house.	Njagala kubeera mu nnyumba eyo.
I don’t want to eat.	Saagala kulya.
But in reality it is not.	Naye mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
It doesn’t seem like it will work.	Kirabika tekijja kukola.
To my father.	Eri taata wange.
I think this was great.	Ndowooza kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
No problem tonight.	Tewali buzibu ekiro kino.
His brother also went.	Muganda we naye yagenda.
However, he now knows who he is.	Kyokka kati amanyi ky’ali.
Good, he thought.	Kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
But, that’s not saying much.	Naye, ekyo si kwogera bingi.
He has a plan.	Alina enteekateeka.
And maybe this is a good thing.	Era mpozzi kino kintu kirungi.
I don’t have any hours.	Sirina ssaawa yonna.
I want.	Njagala.
I was in his room.	Nnali mu kisenge kye.
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
No one knows for sure.	Tewali amanyi bulungi.
He tried to get help.	Yagezaako okufuna obuyambi.
He was beautiful, in a way.	Yali mulungi, mu ngeri emu.
Not now or never.	Si kati oba si bulijjo.
And it was like him.	Era kyali nga ye.
It’s not easy to say that.	Si kyangu kwogera ekyo.
I think you are one.	Ndowooza oli omu.
In fact, it was dangerous.	Mu butuufu, kyali kya bulabe.
You are a lucky man.	Oli musajja wa mukisa.
And he shouldn’t.	Era tasaanidde.
there is no answer.	tewali kuddamu.
Is he the guy?.	Ye ggaayi?.
Now he can.	Kati asobola.
Not for today.	Si lwa leero.
In a sense this is true.	Mu ngeri emu kino kituufu.
But he was planning.	Naye yali ateekateeka.
He wants all those things.	Ayagala ebintu ebyo byonna.
You can’t do everything.	Tosobola kukola buli kimu.
You and the money.	Ggwe ne ssente.
He couldn’t even see what it was.	Yali tasobola na kulaba kye kyali.
That everything was, in fact.	Nti buli kimu kyali, mu butuufu.
The clock started ticking.	Essaawa yatandika okukuba.
At that time you .	Mu kiseera ekyo ggwe .
The movie needed it.	Firimu eyo yali yeetaaga.
This is a common practice.	Eno nkola ya bulijjo.
Everything was very difficult.	Buli kimu kyali kizibu nnyo.
That was probably too hard to do.	Ekyo oboolyawo kyali kizibu nnyo okukola.
He couldn’t believe his luck.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza mukisa gwe.
He's not in her room, but she's not in his room.	Tali mu kisenge kye, naye tali mu kisenge kye.
Perhaps he did too.	Oboolyawo naye yakikola.
I’m working now.	Nze nkola kati.
That’s good to know.	Ekyo kirungi okumanya.
He said what he had to say.	Yayogera bye yalina okwogera.
Perhaps he wanted to help.	Oboolyawo yali ayagala kuyamba.
I've been thinking.	Mbadde ndowooza.
It belonged to his wife.	Yali ya mukyala we.
Actually, this isn’t exactly the case.	Mu butuufu, kino si bwe kiri ddala.
As with the situation.	Nga bwe kiri ku mbeera.
He said he did it.	Yagambye nti yakikola.
He started working.	Yatandika okukola.
However, they are not.	Kyokka, si bwe bali.
He doesn't have a good one now.	Talina mulungi kati.
You’ve always belonged here.	Bulijjo obadde wa wano.
He was nowhere to be found.	Yali talina we yali.
That was always my problem.	Ekyo bulijjo kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
I guess he was being good.	Ntebereza nti yali abeera mulungi.
And we are here.	Era tuli wano.
Here he has a house.	Wano alina ennyumba.
Nothing too complicated though.	Tewali kizibu nnyo wadde.
It had to be like that.	Yalina okuba nga bwe kiri.
I wish it wasn’t though.	Njagala nga si bwe kiri wadde.
I want to go home.	Njagala kudda waka.
He felt his brother near.	Yawulira nga muganda we yali kumpi.
We don’t have time.	Tetulina budde.
One of us is going.	Omu ne ku tugenda.
You have that issue.	Olina ensonga eyo.
But you’re afraid.	Naye ggwe otya.
He wanted to back off.	Yali ayagala okudda emabega.
I know it very well.	Nkimanyi bulungi nnyo.
Not anything like that.	Si kintu kyonna nga ekyo.
He couldn’t do anything right.	Yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna kituufu.
I'm going tonight.	Ngenda ekiro kino.
Please, she thought.	Nsaba, bwe yalowooza.
He didn't know what to do.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola.
It will be wonderful to have him.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo okubeera naye.
But he didn’t want to go too soon.	Naye yali tayagala kugenda mangu nnyo.
Not easy, in this city.	Si kyangu, mu kibuga kino.
This is the truth.	Kino kye kituufu.
That is certainly a possibility.	Ekyo mazima ddala kiyinza okubaawo.
There are problems though.	Waliwo obuzibu wadde.
I think that's what you want.	Ndowooza ekyo ky'oyagala.
But that won’t actually happen.	Naye mu butuufu ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
He said she was his girlfriend.	Yagambye nti ye muganzi we.
Everyone is asleep.	Buli omu yeebase.
He had no one.	Yali talina muntu yenna.
But maybe that’s just him.	Naye mpozzi oyo ye yekka.
I do the same thing.	Nze nkola kye kimu.
It is not easy to find a job.	Si kyangu kufuna mulimu.
You're here.	Oli wano.
Like, it was, but not .	Nga, bwe kyali, naye si .
That’s a good player.	Oyo muzannyi mulungi.
We need to do it.	Twetaaga okukikola.
He thinks he is ready.	Alowooza nti mwetegefu.
Very fast delivery.	Okutuusa amangu nnyo.
I don’t think you should do that.	Sirowooza nti ekyo olina okukikola.
In his house.	Mu nnyumba ye.
That’s what we’re here for.	Ekyo kye tuli wano.
Good to know!.	Kirungi okumanya!.
She prefers to stay home.	Asinga kwagala kusigala waka.
This will be the same.	Kino kijja kuba kye kimu.
Fast delivery .	Okutuusa amangu .
This was a serious problem.	Kino kyali kizibu kya maanyi.
That’s what you’d like.	Ekyo wandyagadde.
The same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu.
Today and every day.	Leero ne buli lunaku.
And they are very friendly.	Era ba mukwano nnyo.
It seems almost normal.	Kirabika kumpi nga kya bulijjo.
We are here to do the work.	Tuli wano okukola omulimu.
This is exactly what someone wanted, he thought.	Kino ddala omuntu kye yali ayagala, bwe yalowooza.
And he was my son.	Era yali mwana wange.
I need to know this.	Kino nnina okumanya.
Where were we? 	Twali ludda wa?
. . . .	.
I will definitely do this again.	Mazima ddala nja kuddamu okukola kino.
He doesn’t deserve this in any way.	Kino tasaanidde mu ngeri yonna.
He certainly would.	Mazima ddala yandikoze.
Maybe that’s you.	Mpozzi oyo ggwe.
You need to know who, and what, he is.	Olina okumanya ani, era kiki, ky’ali.
I wanted to go to school.	Nnali njagala kugenda ku ssomero.
I don't care in any way.	Sifaayo mu ngeri yonna.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
From that room to this.	Okuva mu kisenge ekyo okutuuka ku kino.
My brother and I.	Nze ne muganda wange.
Either he goes or you go.	Oba agenda oba ggwe ogenda.
An attitude is an attitude.	Endowooza ye ndowooza.
All morning at home.	Enkya yonna awaka.
I was afraid too.	Nange nnali ntya.
. . . .	.
I’m a singer.	Nze ndi muyimbi.
And well! 	Era bulungi!
Everyone has one.	Buli muntu alina emu.
He spoke very well.	Yayogera bulungi nnyo.
Approximately .	Okutuuka ku .
He was happy to be with her.	Yali musanyufu okubeera naye.
He was very talkative.	Yali ayogera nnyo.
I knew how to work hard.	Nnali mmanyi okukola ennyo.
Maybe it’s not true.	Mpozzi nga si kituufu.
He may be harmless.	Ayinza okuba nga talina bulabe.
Surely everything would be better now.	Mazima ddala buli kimu kyandibadde kirungi kati.
That would be very dangerous.	Ekyo kyandibadde kya bulabe nnyo.
But it is not the truth.	Naye si kye kituufu.
And he was in trouble when he did it.	Era yali mu buzibu bwe yali akikola.
He was thinking hard now.	Yali alowooza nnyo kati.
I’m just a man.	Nze ndi musajja yekka.
And you are not alone.	Era toli wekka.
Either way, he couldn’t work.	Mu ngeri yonna, yali tasobola kukola.
And indeed they were.	Era ddala baali.
He did his time.	Yakola obudde bwe.
It can fit very well.	Kiyinza okutuuka obulungi ennyo.
My father’s brother.	Muganda wa taata wange.
Nothing can happen from that.	Tewali kiyinza kubaawo okuva mu ekyo.
It was fine but the car was not.	Yali bulungi naye mmotoka si bwe yali.
It was his time.	Yali kiseera kye.
I think that was true for me.	Ndowooza ekyo kyali kituufu gyendi.
But that’s just not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
I’m in danger! 	Nze ndi mu bulabe!
But this he seemed to do.	Naye kino yalabika ng’akola.
I thought it was nothing like that.	Nnali ndowooza nti si kintu ng’ekyo.
He comes here early.	Ajja wano nga bukyali.
But there was nothing to see.	Naye nga tewali kya kulaba.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
Don't go there is no place.	Togenda tewali kifo.
Quite possibly that he was sick.	Oboolyawo nnyo nti yali mulwadde.
But there is none here.	Naye wano tewali.
You want money.	Ggwe ayagala ssente.
This is easy.	Kino kyangu.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kintu kibi.
Hit it hard.	Kuba nnyo.
You belong there, you know.	Oli wa eyo, omanyi.
But there was nothing wrong with him.	Naye nga tewali kibi kyonna ku ye.
I assure everyone.	Nkakasa buli muntu.
Getting home would be nice.	Okutuuka awaka kyandibadde kirungi.
That was a good point .	Eyo yali nsonga nnungi .
He went home early.	Yagenda awaka nga bukyali.
That was one reason.	Eyo ye yali ensonga emu.
I will definitely do it again.	Mazima ddala nja kuddamu okukikola.
She loved dogs.	Yali ayagala nnyo embwa.
I know that he is.	Nkimanyi nti ye.
I know he’s there.	Nkimanyi nti ali awo.
It doesn’t really matter, really.	Si kikulu nnyo, ddala.
And it wasn’t the only one.	Era si kye kyali kyokka.
Clearly, he had his own interests.	Kya lwatu nti yalina ebintu bye yali ayagala ennyo.
And for us.	Era ku ffe.
He is still very good.	Akyali mulungi nnyo.
He knows better than that.	Amanyi okusinga ekyo.
And he didn't want to see anything, either.	Era yali tayagala kulaba kintu kyonna, era.
But he will come in the evening.	Naye ajja kujja akawungeezi.
That only matters to you.	Ekyo kikulu gy’oli kyokka.
I think he knew it.	Ndowooza yali akimanyi.
Obviously that won’t work.	Kya lwatu ekyo tekijja kukola.
Now he had no choice.	Kati yali talina kya kukola.
There's a good chance you won't be back.	Waliwo omukisa omulungi nti togenda kudda.
The weather is still very nice.	Obudde bukyali bulungi nnyo.
But I was afraid too.	Naye nange nnali ntya.
Just a lowly person.	Omuntu wa wansi yekka.
We can only think of each other.	Tusobola okulowooza ku buli omu yekka.
I sure hope he does.	Nkakasa nsuubira nti akola.
They were his wife.	Baali mukyala we.
Maybe a little young for you, though.	Mpozzi nga muto katono gy’oli, wadde.
But that was all he needed.	Naye ekyo kyokka kye yali yeetaaga.
Nothing too bad.	Tewali kintu kyonna kibi nnyo.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
Not everyone can do this.	Kino si buli muntu nti asobola okukola.
It doesn’t really matter.	Mu butuufu si kikulu.
And they are not.	Era si bwe bali.
He can’t do this.	Kino tasobola kukikola.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
He is not here to be friendly.	Tali wano kubeera wa mukwano.
In this .	Mu kino .
I was the teacher.	Nze nnali musomesa.
You were just a kid.	Ggwe wali mwana muto yekka.
This is simply not true.	Kino kyokka si kituufu.
He had hope.	Yalina essuubi.
Even then not everything was good.	Ne mu kiseera ekyo si buli kimu nti kyali kirungi.
And he is alone.	Era ali yekka.
At this point he had no idea how long.	Mu kiseera kino yali talina kirowoozo kyonna kya bbanga ki.
It’s not for everyone though.	Si ya buli muntu wadde.
Like, so many.	Nga, bingi nnyo.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
You should know better than that right now.	Olina okumanya okusinga ekyo mu kiseera kino.
It is everywhere.	Buli mu kifo kyonna.
I was actually planning to do the same thing.	Mu butuufu nnali nteekateeka okukola ekintu kye kimu.
Now he loves it.	Kati ayagala nnyo.
That’s very, very important.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo nnyo.
And in a way he was.	Era mu ngeri emu yali.
It is very close now.	Kiri kumpi nnyo kati.
I hope we’ll all be okay.	Nsuubira nti ffenna tujja kuba bulungi.
It would be interesting to read this issue.	Kyandibadde kirungi okusoma ensonga eno.
No one can be like that.	Tewali ayinza kuba bw’atyo.
We can do it too.	Naffe tusobola.
But, we should.	Naye, tusaanidde.
Me and you too.	Nze naawe naye.
And what kind of child would he be.	Era yandibadde mwana wa ngeri ki.
I want to work on something.	Njagala okukola ku kintu.
It was as good a place as any.	Kyali kifo kirungi nga kyonna.
He doesn't know why.	Tamanyi lwaki.
That’s normal here.	Ekyo kya bulijjo wano.
With no one here to talk to.	Nga tewali muntu yenna wano kwogera naye.
No, this isn’t the only one either.	Nedda, ne kino si kye kyokka.
He agreed it was time to step back a bit.	Yakkiriza nti kye kiseera okudda emabega katono.
He had to act quickly.	Yalina okukola amangu.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe yali.
I want to know where to go, actually.	Njagala okumanya gye nnyinza okugenda, mu butuufu.
He certainly was.	Mazima ddala yali.
I was thinking though.	Nali ndowooza wadde.
Or whatever it was.	Oba kyonna kye kyali.
And it was pretty cool.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo.
Not every artist would do that.	Si buli muyimbi nti yandikoze ekyo.
How it would always always be.	Engeri gye kyandibadde bulijjo bulijjo.
I can get to you.	Nsobola okutuuka gy’oli.
No one knew it was me.	Tewali yali amanyi nti nze.
No, that’s pretty cool.	Nedda, ekyo kirungi nnyo.
However, there is one here with me.	Kyokka wano nange waliwo omu.
He knew just what he wanted.	Yali amanyi ekyo kyokka kye yali ayagala.
I will be there alone.	Nja kubeerawo nzekka.
You’ve been working here for a long time.	Obadde okola wano ebbanga ddene.
And he knows it.	Era akimanyi.
It had to be me.	Kyalina okuba nga nze.
We’ll talk to you soon.	Tujja kwogera naawe mu bbanga ttono.
He loves planning.	Ayagala nnyo enteekateeka.
His plan worked.	Enteekateeka ye yakola.
And it wasn’t like that.	Era nga si bwe kyali.
We’ll go for a ride.	Tujja kugenda okuvuga.
I know it’s not true.	Nkimanyi nti si kituufu.
Apparently that’s what everyone wants.	Kirabika ekyo buli muntu ky’ayagala.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
Probably throughout the house.	Oboolyawo mu nnyumba yonna.
All we can say.	Byonna bye tusobola okwogera.
Everyone thinks movies are just one thing.	Buli omu alowooza nti firimu kintu kimu kyokka.
That one was actually pretty good.	Oyo mu butuufu yali mulungi nnyo.
You know how they are.	Omanyi bwe bali.
Maybe no one does.	Mpozzi tewali akola.
And that was all it was.	Era ekyo kye kyali kyokka.
I don’t think it will be good.	Sirowooza nti kijja kuba kirungi.
No one came at all.	Tewali yajja n’akatono.
And he was going.	Era yali agenda.
He is always with us.	Ali naffe bulijjo.
The real problem is the weddings.	Ekizibu ennyo ze mbaga.
We have to talk.	Tulina okwogera.
It’s very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo okukola.
He came home to study.	Yajja awaka okusoma.
That’s not what we were supposed to be.	Ekyo si kye twali tulina okubeera.
But that was in theory.	Naye ekyo kyali mu ndowooza.
He could do this.	Kino yali asobola okukikola.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Kyokka kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
You know, this is important to us.	Omanyi kino kikulu gye tuli.
Or perhaps .	Oba oboolyawo .
I am not sure how to proceed.	Sikakasa ngeri ki gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso.
He absolutely has.	Alina ddala.
You know that’s not true.	Omanyi ekyo si kituufu.
No, not at all.	Nedda, si bwe kiri n’akatono.
He wanted to move on.	Yali ayagala kugenda mu maaso.
You’ve been busy.	Obadde bbize.
But you are not.	Naye ggwe si bwe kiri.
Not now .	Si kati .
He worked really hard.	Yakola nnyo ddala.
It was the only thing he knew how to do.	Kye kintu kyokka kye yali amanyi okukola.
I’m not that me.	Nze si nze ekyo.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si nsonga.
But you are here.	Naye ggwe oli wano.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
We’re going to go.	Ffe tuli kugenda.
There isn’t much.	Tewali bingi.
But not all of us.	Kyokka si ffenna.
Herein lies my problem.	Wano ekizibu kyange we kiri.
Pretty good, actually.	Kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
I just want you to come to me soon.	Njagala kyokka singa ojja gyendi mangu.
And one week.	Era wiiki emu.
It wasn’t the police.	Si ye yali poliisi.
I won’t try it.	Sijja kugezaako.
But not everyone was of the same opinion.	Naye si buli muntu nti yali wa ndowooza emu.
But that’s not what matters.	Naye ekyo si kye kikulu.
I like it as it is.	Njagala nga bwe kiri.
I wish he had no issue with me.	Njagala nga talina nsonga gyendi.
He may still be now.	Ayinza okuba nga akyali kati.
But he’s not going to do that.	Naye ekyo tagenda kukikola.
But you can do things for that.	Naye ekyo osobola okukola ebintu.
This is just today’s reality.	Kino kituufu kya leero kyokka.
But probably not so much as you.	Naye oboolyawo si nnyo nga ggwe.
I could do it too.	Nange nnali nsobola okukikola.
In the room.	Mu kisenge.
I’m not sure where and when.	Sikakasa wa ne ddi.
It’s good to see you look good.	Kirungi okulaba nga olabika bulungi.
That doesn’t matter a bit.	Ekyo si kikulu katono.
They are together.	Bali wamu.
He does whatever he wants.	Akola kyonna ky’ayagala.
Nothing matters to them.	Tewali kikulu gye bali.
You are one of us.	Ggwe oli omu ku ffe.
But it was difficult.	Naye kyali kizibu.
I don’t really know, myself.	Nze simanyi bulungi, nze kennyini.
he can’t last very long.	tasobola kumala bbanga ddene nnyo.
Probably younger than him, too.	Oboolyawo naye nga muto okusinga ye.
However, we will know.	Kyokka tujja kumanya.
It could happen tomorrow.	Kiyinza okubaawo enkya.
Not bad.	Si kibi.
I have to know.	Nnina okumanya.
He will know someone.	Ajja kumanya omuntu.
This is a logical approach.	Eno nkola ya nsonga.
And it's good for you.	Era kirungi gy'oli.
Having his help was a blessing.	Okufuna obuyambi bwe kyali kya mukisa.
Maybe it’s too bad.	Mpozzi nga kibi nnyo.
He was a player.	Yali muzannyi.
That is why he is there.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki ali eyo.
It’s just not the right time.	Si kiseera kituufu kyokka.
But he didn’t want to, of course.	Naye yali tayagala, ddala.
He won’t play very long.	Tajja kuzannya bbanga ddene nnyo.
It's party time!.	Ssaawa ya mbaga!.
Nobody really likes that.	Ekyo tewali ayagala nnyo.
That won’t really work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola ddala.
It doesn’t matter it doesn’t matter.	Si kikulu si kikulu.
It was actually real.	Mu butuufu kyali kya ddala.
In theory, that’s true.	Mu ndowooza, ekyo kituufu.
More than anyone else.	Okusinga omuntu yenna.
No, nothing good.	Nedda, tewali kirungi.
Now he is.	Kati ali.
In fact, it is not.	Mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
You will be very happy.	Ojja kuba musanyufu nnyo.
And now I don’t know what to say.	Era kati simanyi kya kwogera.
That was very important to me.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo gyendi.
It is not an easy thing to say.	Si kintu kyangu kwogera.
He came not long ago.	Yajja si bbanga ddene.
You don’t have any friends.	Tolina mikwano.
It’s hard to imagine how.	Kizibu okulowooza ku ngeri ki.
Back to, back to.	Okudda ku, okudda ku.
She looked the best.	Yalabika bulungi okusinga byonna.
I can make the point either way.	Nsobola okukola ensonga mu ngeri yonna.
I will love.	Nja kwagala.
I really needed to go.	Nnali nneetaaga nnyo okugenda.
In any case.	Mu ngeri yonna.
I want to know.	Njagala kumanya.
He never has to work hard.	Talina n’akatono kukola nnyo.
Or tried to do it.	Oba yagezaako okukikola.
And you think hard.	Era olowooza nnyo.
You will always have .	Bulijjo ojja kuba ne .
He couldn’t let it happen.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
Today, however, it is.	Kyokka leero bwe kiri.
I thought he must surely be thinking of something.	Nalowooza nti mazima ddala yandibadde alowooza ku kintu.
Everything we need is there.	Buli kye twetaaga kiri awo.
He had no problem with that.	Ekyo yali talina buzibu bwonna.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
But you can’t live there.	Naye tosobola kubeera eyo.
Better vision.	Okulaba bulungi.
All right, there’s a problem.	Kirungi, waliwo obuzibu.
Everything looks good.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi.
But it’s not, of course.	Naye si bwe kiri, ddala.
He has the power.	Alina amaanyi.
I was very happy about that.	Ekyo nnali musanyufu nnyo.
Now this is something.	Kati kino kintu.
I don't know exactly where.	Simanyi bulungi wa.
The book was there.	Ekitabo kyali awo.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
And he was very young.	Era nga muto nnyo.
Or to each other.	Oba eri buli omu.
There is no help whatsoever.	Tewali buyambi bwonna.
I know this now.	Kino nkimanyi kati.
Not so with me.	Si bwe kiri ku nze.
Only one problem .	Ekizibu kimu kyokka .
This is what he knew.	Kino kye yali amanyi.
I have to go.	Nze nnina okugenda.
That’s what we have to do this week.	Ekyo kye tulina okukola wiiki eno.
And you can do that.	Era ekyo osobola okukikola.
Don't come here.	Tojja wano.
So he asked his friend.	Bwatyo yabuuza mukwano gwe.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
I didn’t think it would work.	Nnali sirowooza nti kijja kukola.
He certainly likes to win.	Mazima ddala ayagala nnyo okuwangula.
I love it about this.	Nze njagala nnyo ku nsonga eno.
His wife was not supposed to know anything about it.	Mukyala we yali talina kumanya kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
You have to be there.	Olina okuba eyo.
Really, he does.	Ddala, akola bw’atyo.
Back to the hospital.	Okudda mu ddwaaliro.
He thought it was pretty cool.	Yalowooza nti kirungi nnyo.
And that’s very difficult.	Era ekyo kizibu nnyo.
He is so good throughout.	Ye mulungi nnyo mu kiseera kyonna.
Everyone should be here soon.	Buli omu yandibadde wano mu bbanga ttono.
It is indeed difficult.	Mazima ddala kizibu.
He was beautiful, he knew it.	Yali mulungi, yali akimanyi.
No one should have to deal with anything like this.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kukola ku kintu kyonna nga kino.
That’s a good thing.	Ekyo kiri bulungi.
It is in the present.	Kiri mu kiseera kino.
Out of time.	Okuva mu budde.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
No, he is not.	Nedda ye si bwe kiri.
Probably just that someone is in his office.	Oboolyawo kyokka nti waliwo omuntu mu ofiisi ye.
We will be there to help.	Tujja kubeerawo okuyamba.
He couldn’t find anyone.	Yali tasobola kufuna muntu yenna.
He knew how far he could go.	Yali amanyi we yali asobola okutuuka.
But that’s what he did.	Naye ekyo kye yakola.
He wanted to go, of course he did.	Yali ayagala kugenda, ddala yagenda.
That’s hard to do.	Ekyo kizibu okukola.
Now we need to talk.	Kati twetaaga okwogera.
No, another one.	Nedda, omulala.
It was the perfect time for everyone.	Kyali kiseera kituufu eri buli muntu.
I will do that.	Ekyo nja kukikola.
It's pretty good this way, actually.	Kirungi nnyo mu ngeri eno, mu butuufu.
It’s not lovely.	Si kya kwagala.
No, they are not.	Nedda si bwe bali.
No, I feel like it.	Nedda, mpulira nga bwe kiri.
He was living a little lonely.	Yali abeera yekka katono.
He was happy here.	Yali musanyufu wano.
He is a good man.	Musajja mulungi.
No, he has a reason.	Nedda, alina ensonga.
He was a young child.	Yali mwana muto.
And, that was true for me, too.	Era, ekyo kyali kituufu gyendi, era.
He would have worked with me in my timeframe.	Yandibadde akola nange mu kiseera kye nnali nfunye.
I don’t think you will.	Sirowooza nti ojja kukikola.
And you can talk to him.	Era osobola okwogera naye.
But he can’t do it.	Naye tasobola kukikola.
I feel down there.	Nze mpulira wansi awo.
And he was truthful.	Era yali wa mazima.
Like all of them.	Nga byonna.
With him strong we can beat anyone.	Nga ye wa maanyi tusobola okukuba omuntu yenna.
I’m very busy.	Nze ndi bbize nnyo.
There is hope for all of us.	Waliwo essuubi eri ffenna.
In a way, it was easy.	Mu ngeri emu, kyali kyangu.
I have a thing for him, now.	Nnina ekintu ku ye, kati.
For this there are many reasons.	Ku kino waliwo ensonga nnyingi.
We’ll know it’s you.	Tujja kumanya nti ggwe.
I know you know this.	Nkimanyi nti kino okimanyi.
Not so with me.	Si bwe kiri ku nze.
He knew what it looked like.	Yali amanyi engeri gye kyali kirabika.
And this is not the place to do it.	Era kino si kifo kya kukikola.
Both are normal.	Bombi ba bulijjo.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
Of course, he had.	Kya lwatu nti yalina.
But that’s a good answer.	Naye ekyo kya kuddamu kirungi.
That’s very, very normal.	Ekyo kya bulijjo nnyo nnyo.
His wife was with him.	Mukyala we yali naye.
He doesn’t want to be with us.	Tayagala kubeera ffembi.
There is no issue here.	Wano tewali nsonga yonna.
He’s already done it.	Yakikola dda.
He was my son.	Yali mwana wange.
But this is just it.	Naye kino kye kiri kyokka.
. . . .	.
And maybe it was.	Era mpozzi bwe kyali.
That will be easy to do.	Ekyo kijja kuba kyangu okukola.
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
We will move forward.	Tujja kugenda mu maaso.
He came to my room.	Yajja mu kisenge kyange.
He had to help.	Yalina okuyamba.
I know you’re there.	Nkimanyi nti oli awo.
He shouldn’t be here.	Tasaanidde kubeera wano.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
I wanted to go be alone in my room.	Nnali njagala kugenda kubeera nzekka mu kisenge kyange.
He was the one who needed help.	Ye yali yeetaaga obuyambi.
You know it, too.	Naawe okimanyi.
That’s not an ordinary job.	Ekyo si mulimu gwa bulijjo.
Being aware at this point.	Okubeera nga omanyi mu kiseera kino.
You are happy to be with you.	Oli musanyufu okubeera naawe.
We need it.	Twetaaga.
I need to talk.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera.
The attitude was this.	Endowooza yali eno.
That would be very important.	Ekyo kyandibadde kikulu nnyo.
I could do it again.	Nnali nsobola okuddamu okukikola.
And this is very dangerous.	Era kino kya bulabe nnyo.
Perhaps he did.	Oboolyawo yakikola.
My father is very practical.	Taata wange wa nkola nnyo.
We can go on from there.	Tusobola okugenda mu maaso okuva awo.
Glad he's my friend.	Musanyufu nti mukwano gwange.
You know it’s coming, and it’s coming.	Omanyi nti kijja, era kijja.
I’ve been very busy.	Nze mbadde bbize nnyo.
It’s always the same.	Bulijjo kye kimu.
But it was very, very hard.	Naye kyali kizibu nnyo nnyo.
Really, that’s what it is.	Ddala, ekyo kye kiri.
We are completely alone here.	Tuli ddala ffekka wano.
We’re going to try.	Tugenda kugezaako.
I have to get out of town.	Nnina okuva mu kibuga.
Or in the morning.	Oba ku makya.
You are here, and this is now.	Oli wano, era kino kiri kati.
I feel so sick.	Mpulira nga ndi mulwadde nnyo.
But this is not very good.	Naye kino si kirungi nnyo.
He wasn’t going to be able to see.	Yali tagenda kusobola kulaba.
He will do it today.	Ajja kukikola leero.
We certainly have.	Mazima ddala tulina.
I do it myself.	Nze kennyini nkola.
If it were true.	Singa kyali kituufu.
They are not the police.	Si ba poliisi.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
This had to be human.	Kino kyalina okuba nga kya muntu.
I was very happy in a way.	Nali musanyufu nnyo mu ngeri emu.
However, that wasn’t exactly it.	Kyokka, ekyo si kye kyali ddala.
I am not a singer.	Siri muyimbi.
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Nnali sisobola kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
He was coming forward.	Yali ajja mu maaso.
He had something about that.	Yalina ekintu ku ekyo.
And, well .	Era, bulungi .
I feel normal.	Mpulira nga ndi wa bulijjo.
And he probably knew it too.	Era osanga naye yali akimanyi.
You’re going to do it.	Ogenda kukikola.
We are both in trouble.	Ffembi tuli mu buzibu.
And apparently he did.	Era kirabika bw’atyo bwe yakola.
I can’t do this.	Kino sisobola kukikola.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
You were a child too.	Naawe wali mwana muto.
He was always good.	Bulijjo yali mulungi.
I don’t like it more than you do.	Sikyagala okusinga ggwe.
Not so his wife.	Si bwe kiri mukyala we.
If only you knew.	Singa oba omanyi.
And of course now.	Era ddala kati.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
It won’t be the same,.	Tekijja kuba kye kimu,.
However, I don’t really care.	Kyokka, sifaayo nnyo.
This is what we can do.	Kino kye tusobola okukola.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
But he wanted it all.	Naye byonna yali ayagala.
I’m going to drive a car.	Ngenda kuvuga mmotoka.
He did this with her in the room.	Kino yakikola naye mu kisenge.
This may be true.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
We are all alone.	Ffenna tuli ffekka.
There is nothing we can do.	Tewali kye tusobola kukola.
It was him.	Yali ye.
I know he is home.	Nkimanyi nti ali waka.
This was fine, he needed this.	Kino kyali kirungi, kino yali yeetaaga.
Lots of help.	Obuyambi bungi.
I want to be me.	Njagala kubeera nze.
It’s not good or bad.	Si kirungi oba kibi.
But he had no idea how to proceed.	Naye yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku ngeri gye yandibadde agenda mu maaso.
I don’t know the right answer.	Simanyi kya kuddamu kituufu.
Then he knew he couldn’t.	Awo n’amanya nti tasobola.
You can't be.	Tosobola kuba.
Now, that was easy.	Kati, ekyo kyali kyangu.
And that’s what he needed to do.	Era ekyo kye yali yeetaaga okukola.
What exactly is going on.	Kiki ddala ekigenda mu maaso.
You know it, too.	Naawe okimanyi.
It was everybody.	Yali buli muntu.
I will do this a lot .	Kino nja kukikola nnyo .
You are not a doctor.	Toli musawo.
That’s just not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri kyokka.
But like all of us, he wants to know better.	Naye nga ffenna, ayagala kumanya bulungi.
I will do that.	Ekyo nja kukikola.
Everyone wants to win, everyone wants to do well.	Buli muntu ayagala kuwangula, buli muntu ayagala kukola bulungi.
You’re coming soon, anyway.	Ojja mu bbanga ttono, mu ngeri yonna.
I won’t do it here.	Sijja kukikola wano.
However, that is neither here nor there.	Kyokka, ekyo si wano wadde awo.
Everyone knows this to be true.	Kino buli omu akimanyi nti kituufu.
He was a good kid.	Yali mwana mulungi.
And here we go.	Era wano we tugenda.
Excellent opportunity.	Omukisa omulungi ennyo.
Getting strength from each other.	Okufuna amaanyi okuva eri buli omu.
This is a matter of fact.	Eno nsonga ya mazima.
I really need to go.	Nze ddala nneetaaga okugenda.
He couldn’t love anymore.	Yali tasobola kuddamu kwagala.
Doing so is easy.	Okukikola kyangu.
No, it’s fine.	Nedda, kirungi.
It will definitely happen.	Mazima ddala kijja kubaawo.
I think quickly.	Ndowooza mangu.
And it will happen.	Era kijja kubaawo.
And he didn’t quite know how.	Era yali tamanyi bulungi ngeri ki.
I don’t really care as well.	Sifaayo nnyo nga bwe kiri.
And he did this.	Era yakola kino.
It can certainly be simple.	Mazima ddala kiyinza okuba nga kyangu.
He probably won’t be back today.	Oboolyawo tajja kudda leero.
But he looked good.	Naye yalabika bulungi.
Now he was nowhere, but he was with us everywhere.	Kati yali talina we yali, naye yali naffe buli wamu.
Or, he couldn’t.	Oba, yali tasobola.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
This is yours.	Ye wa ggwe.
Here, it is not.	Wano, si bwe kiri.
It’s good now.	Kirungi kati.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
But he	Naye ye .
I don’t have any friends.	Sirina mikwano.
This is the easiest.	Kino kye kyangu nnyo.
But this is very simple.	Naye kino kyangu nnyo.
This is what we are.	Kino kye tuli.
Of course, he had.	Kya lwatu nti yalina.
This is completely normal.	Kino kya bulijjo ddala.
Of course, we cannot continue as we are.	Kya lwatu nti tetusobola kugenda mu maaso nga bwe tuli.
He tried anything.	Yagezaako ekintu kyonna.
And that will be that.	Era ekyo kijja kuba ekyo.
He probably delivered the best speech.	Oboolyawo yayogera okwogera okusinga obulungi.
We are real.	Tuli ba ddala.
It won’t go away now.	Tekijja kugenda kati.
It's his thing, you might say.	Kintu kye, oyinza okugamba.
He may have done it.	Ayinza okuba nga yakikola.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
I need to talk to a friend.	Nnina okwogera ne mukwano gwange.
Everything is there.	Buli kimu kiri awo.
Young young.	Muto muto.
No one does, really.	Tewali akola, ddala.
Everyone is going to be there.	Buli omu agenda kubeerawo.
But he's there.	Naye ali awo.
He has to think, like me.	Alina okulowooza, nga nze.
One thing, though.	Kyokka, ekintu kimu.
I don't want you on.	Saagala ggwe ku.
It was his thing.	Kyali kintu kye.
I can’t do it.	Nze sisobola kukikola.
We are in trouble.	Tuli mu buzibu.
I was already on it.	Nali dda ku yo.
And they are fine.	Era bali bulungi.
You don’t really have time.	Mu butuufu tolina budde.
This is very unusual.	Kino si kya bulijjo nnyo.
I’m mostly very happy.	Nze okusinga ndi musanyufu nnyo.
And he was very good.	Era yali mulungi nnyo.
That wasn’t him, at all.	Oyo si ye yali, n’akatono.
I don’t even know how long.	Simanyi na bbanga ki.
He did it.	Yakikola.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka kino si bwe kiri.
And yet here we are.	Era naye wano we tuli.
He would be nowhere but me.	Yandibadde talina w’ali okuggyako nze.
Above all .	Okusinga byonna .
There is something for everyone.	Waliwo ekintu kya buli muntu.
He was like that.	Yali bw’atyo.
That would be a good thing to do.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi okukola.
Nothing could be more true.	Tewali kiyinza kuba kituufu okusinga ekyo.
No, that is absolutely true.	Nedda, ekyo kituufu nnyo.
He still doesn’t have one.	N’okutuusa kati talina.
He was just that good.	Yali mulungi bw’atyo yekka.
He lives in the present.	Abeera mu kiseera kino.
Or so he did.	Oba bwe yakola.
But no man can do everything.	Naye tewali musajja yenna asobola kukola buli kimu.
Obviously it wasn’t.	Kya lwatu si bwe kyali.
But you seem to be alone.	Naye olabika oli wekka.
I have nothing to say.	Sirina kye nnyinza kwogera.
It was a routine.	Yali nkola ya bulijjo.
I don’t care to know.	Sifaayo kumanya.
We are one group.	Tuli kibiina kimu.
No, that won’t work.	Nedda, ekyo tekijja kukola.
And he was beautiful.	Era yali mulungi.
I feel lucky in this regard.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa mu nsonga eno.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
He had no idea who it was, just that.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku ani, ekyo kyokka.
But the boyfriend wasn’t having it.	Naye muganzi yali talina.
Maybe he thought it was you.	Mpozzi yalowooza nti ye ggwe.
He wants to work.	Ayagala kukola.
I was a little nervous.	Nali ntya katono.
I hope everyone is okay.	Nsuubira buli omu ali bulungi.
That would have to go .	Ekyo kyandibadde kigenda .
We are moving forward.	Tugenda mu maaso.
This is still not the same.	Kino n’okutuusa kati si kye kimu.
I know nothing about it.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
I couldn’t come.	Nnali sisobola kujja.
He is a very happy child.	Ye mwana musanyufu nnyo.
Nothing is real except imagination.	Tewali kintu kya ddala okuggyako okulowooza.
It is here and it is there.	Kiri wano era kiri awo.
I didn’t know what.	Nnali simanyi ki.
I thought it would be easy.	Nalowooza nti kijja kuba kyangu.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
He can do these things.	Asobola okukola ebintu bino.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
And he knows how to do it.	Era amanyi okukikola.
I’m ready to talk when you are.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okwogera nga oli.
You can buy anything in no time.	Osobola okugula ekintu kyonna mu bbanga ttono.
But who could that person be?.	Naye omuntu oyo yandiba ani?.
And he will know why.	Era ajja kumanya lwaki.
It could have gone on.	Kyandibadde kigenda mu maaso.
But this is not true.	Naye kino si kituufu.
. . . .	.
No one is particularly interested here.	Tewali muntu yenna alina ky’ayagala ennyo wano.
It’s definitely not good at all.	Mazima ddala si kirungi n’akatono.
That’s one good thing.	Ekyo ekintu kimu kirungi.
He said he wouldn't admit he did it.	Yagambye nti tajja kukkiriza nti yakikola.
The same is true at work.	Kino kye kimu ne ku mulimu.
And he could think.	Era yali asobola okulowooza.
Then we also have to think about that.	Awo era tulina okulowooza ku nsonga eyo.
Everyone is talking about it.	Buli omu ayogera ku nsonga eyo.
For what he wants.	Ku ky’ayagala.
I feel that’s just true.	Mpulira nti ekyo kituufu kyokka.
I know so much more.	Nze mmanyi bingi nnyo.
He knew who, of course.	Yali amanyi ani, ddala.
But there are many.	Naye bingi.
I wanted to do it anyway.	Nnali njagala kukikola mu ngeri yonna.
It was a very difficult thing to do.	Kyali kintu kizibu nnyo okukola.
I think that’s very important.	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo.
You can swim.	Osobola okuwuga.
I know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
No one can know about this.	Tewali ayinza kumanya ku nsonga eno.
He will never do it again.	Tajja kuddamu kukikola.
I knew what was going to happen.	Nnali mmanyi ekigenda okubaawo.
As you were.	Nga bwe wali.
He does that every day.	Ekyo akikola buli lunaku.
This seems pretty simple to me.	Kino kirabika nga kyangu nnyo gyendi.
Very very close.	Kumpi nnyo nnyo.
It was a powerful idea.	Yali ndowooza ya maanyi nnyo.
It was just, suddenly, there.	Kyali kyokka, mu bwangu, awo.
And he was coming.	Era yali ajja.
I’ve always wanted to do things like this.	Bulijjo njagala nnyo okukola ebintu nga bino.
Obviously, this is a very good idea.	Kya lwatu nti endowooza eno nnungi nnyo.
Everyone was asleep.	Buli omu yali yeebase.
However, this is not a laborious task.	Kyokka, guno si mulimu gwa maanyi.
And going home is up to you.	Era okudda eka kiri gy’oli.
He didn't know how to answer.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ya kuddamu.
We always have, we always will.	Bulijjo tulina, bulijjo tujja kukikola.
There is nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna.
I’m there very, very much.	Nze ndi awo nnyo nnyo.
He didn’t want to, yet.	Yali tayagala, n’okutuusa kati.
She has .	Ye alina .
For the child, you are the father.	Ku mwana, ggwe taata.
It’s not easy being him.	Si kyangu kubeera ye.
I thought it wouldn’t happen.	Nalowooza nti tekijja kubaawo.
But not everyone is.	Naye buli muntu si bwe kiri.
There’s a guy.	Waliwo ggaayi.
He can’t talk at all.	Tasobola kwogera n’akatono.
You don’t have to wait.	Tolina kulinda.
This can happen to anyone.	Kino kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna.
I have been in that position.	Mbadde mu kifo ekyo.
You in a relationship.	Ggwe mu mukwano.
They were real, both of them.	Baali ba ddala, bombi.
A friend he talked to.	Mukwano gwe yayogera naye.
I am well aware that this is not easy.	Nkimanyi bulungi nti kino si kyangu.
I was sure he would agree.	Nali nkakasa nti ajja kukkiriza.
He had nothing to do.	Yali talina kya kukola.
At the time he said no.	Mu kiseera ekyo yagamba nti nedda.
Who's going.	Ani agenda.
I thought it would be really cool.	Nalowooza nti ddala kyandibadde kirungi.
And it’s not good.	Era si kirungi.
I guess we’ll have to see.	Nsuubira nti tujja kuba tulina okulaba.
He always knew.	Bulijjo yali amanyi.
This will not be easy, nor will it be easy.	Kino tekijja kuba kyangu, era tekijja kuba kyangu.
Very close, anyway.	Kumpi nnyo, mu ngeri yonna.
But he is strong.	Naye wa maanyi.
And now you’re coming.	Era kati ojja.
I know, that’s my sin.	Nkimanyi, ekyo kye kibi kyange.
I really can’t believe it, at all.	Ddala sisobola kukkiriza, n’akatono.
I needed one.	Nnali nneetaaga emu.
I’m just as curious as you are, actually.	Nze njagala okumanya nga ggwe, mu butuufu.
I know he will come to you.	Nkimanyi nti ajja kujja gy’oli.
It was quite something.	Kyali kintu nnyo.
Only he knows that.	Ekyo ye yekka akimanyi.
This was a problem for us.	Kino kyali kizibu gye tuli.
This he agreed to.	Kino yakkiriza.
That one couldn’t.	Oyo omu yali tasobola.
I will do the same here.	Nze wano nange nja kukola kye kimu.
He didn’t even like to eat.	Yali tayagala nnyo wadde okulya.
Why don't you go, she thought.	Lwaki togenda, bwe yalowooza.
I’m praying a lot.	Nze nsaba nnyo.
It was time now to go.	Kyali kiseera kati okugenda.
He was certainly too young for all this.	Mazima ddala yali muto nnyo ku bino byonna.
Not in everything, of course.	Si mu buli kimu, ddala.
Or in the evening or.	Oba akawungeezi oba.
No one can believe it.	Tewali ayinza kukkiriza.
He had nothing at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali talina ky’alina.
That probably won’t happen.	Ekyo osanga tekijja kubaawo.
And you’re going to preach.	Era ogenda kubuulira.
I'll wait here, my friend.	Nja kulinda wano mukwano gwange.
I need to know why.	Nnina okumanya lwaki.
Now, he couldn’t.	Kati, yali tasobola.
And he won’t do it.	Era tajja kukikola.
But that’s not all .	Naye si ekyo kyokka .
There is nothing we can do.	Tewali kye tusobola kukola.
That’s not for now.	Ekyo si kya kiseera kino.
You’re an ordinary guy.	Oli ggaayi wa bulijjo.
While he was there.	Nga ali eyo.
But, this is not your case.	Naye, eno si nsonga yo.
I want to keep working.	Njagala kusigala nga nkola.
For each of us, of course.	Ku buli omu ku ffe, ddala.
At my office all morning busy.	Ku ofiisi yange enkya yonna nga bbize.
For a little while .	Okumala akaseera katono .
But he knew, of course.	Naye yali amanyi, mazima ddala.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
I’m glad you’re interested.	Ndi musanyufu nti oyagala.
No one has time.	Tewali alina budde.
I like this concept in practice.	Njagala nnyo endowooza eno mu nkola.
He's here.	Ali wano.
No one is speaking.	Tewali ayogera.
One thing we must know is that timing is everything.	Ekintu kimu kye tulina okumanya kiri nti obudde kye buli kimu.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
You will see all the problems here.	Ojja kulaba obuzibu bwonna wano.
I could talk to him about anything.	Nnali nsobola okwogera naye ku kintu kyonna.
That’s what he had.	Ekyo yalina.
No one knows what it is.	Tewali amanyi kye kiri.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
You don’t have to make a movie.	Tolina kukola firimu.
He wants to move on.	Ayagala kugenda mu maaso.
But he couldn’t come.	Naye yali tasobola kujja.
And it can happen.	Era kiyinza okubaawo.
Clearly, he was not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe yali.
Good for ya.	Kirungi ku ya.
And he, even now.	Ne ye, ne kati.
But the house.	Naye ennyumba.
You have to have it.	Olina okuba nga olina.
Everyone is their own person.	Buli omu muntu we.
Like my father, and like me.	Nga taata, era nga nze.
Nothing is alone.	Tewali kintu kyonna kye kiri kyokka.
I am very curious.	Njagala nnyo okumanya.
We were in the.	Twali mu.
Obviously, this is the case.	Kya lwatu nti kino bwe kiri.
Everything was right about, right.	Buli kimu kyali kituufu ku, kituufu.
And it’s pretty close.	Era kiri kumpi nnyo.
A lot, though.	Bingi, wadde.
I think it’s great and very simple!!.	Ndowooza kirungi nnyo era kyangu nnyo!!.
This was certainly powerful.	Mazima ddala kino kyali kya maanyi.
I don’t know, and neither do you.	Simanyi, era naawe tomanyi.
There is nothing wrong in knowing that.	Tewali kibi kyonna mu kumanya ekyo.
It was my watch but it wasn’t my watch.	Yali ssaawa yange naye nga si ssaawa yange.
I wasn’t sure there for a little while.	Nali sikakasa awo okumala akaseera katono.
My father was at work.	Taata yali ku mulimu.
He thought it was time.	Yalowooza nti kye kiseera.
I knew what it would be like.	Nnali mmanyi engeri gye kyandibadde.
That can be a challenge.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
And maybe we should too.	Era mpozzi naffe tusaanidde.
He wants to win, and he wants to play early.	Ayagala kuwangula, era ayagala kuzannya nga bukyali.
He had been.	Yali abadde...
He didn't want to talk about that now.	Ekyo yali tayagala kwogera ku nsonga eyo kati.
You will be mine.	Ojja kuba wange.
It’s not likely, but it actually is.	Si kiyinza okuba, naye mu butuufu bwe kiri.
And it always was.	Era bulijjo bwe kyali.
No one has to do it alone.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kukikola yekka.
Either way, we can’t wait.	Mu ngeri yonna, tetusobola kulinda.
Very good performance.	Okukola obulungi ennyo.
Or nothing really.	Oba si kintu kyonna ddala.
But it’s not as simple as that.	Naye si kyangu nga ekyo.
But my problem was this.	Naye ekizibu kyange kyali kino.
Someone has to respond to this.	Waliwo omuntu alina okuddamu ku kino.
That's the thing though.	Ekyo kye kintu wadde.
It was a very intimate affair.	Yali nsonga ya mukwano nnyo.
No one is here.	Tewali muntu yenna ali wano.
Everyone has already heard of me.	Buli omu yawulira dda ku nze.
What a wonderful idea.	Nga kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I don’t really know it’s my car.	Nze simanyi bulungi nti mmotoka yange.
It was very real.	Kyali kya ddala nnyo.
It was very .	Yali nnyo .
He would have been like that.	Yandibadde bw’atyo.
It’s up to you.	Kiri gy’oli.
It’s a movie, but it’s not quite a movie.	Firimu, naye si firimu nnyo.
He had to go into planning.	Yalina okugenda mu nteekateeka.
I need to talk to him.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naye.
But you know very well.	Naye omanyi bulungi nnyo.
You’re already on.	Oli ku dda.
Only his wife knew about this work.	Mukyala we yekka ye yali amanyi ku mulimu guno.
I was almost back.	Nnali kumpi okudda.
It’s completely unusual.	Si kya bulijjo ddala.
I need to move on though.	Nze nneetaaga okugenda mu maaso wadde.
But it will be difficult.	Naye kijja kuba kizibu.
Now because he is his friends.	Kati kuba ye mikwano gye.
I am very lucky.	Ndi wa mukisa nnyo.
I love to eat food.	Njagala nnyo okulya emmere.
But, we are here.	Naye, tuli wano.
I didn’t even want to talk to him.	Nnali saagala na kwogera naye.
I don't know how.	Simanyi ngeri ki.
He said that he did.	Yagamba nti yakikola.
Here's that picture.	Wano ekifaananyi ekyo.
I have one problem.	Nnina ekizibu kimu.
It’s actually very, very simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo, kyangu nnyo.
It’s not quite right.	Si kituufu nnyo.
This is very unrealistic.	Kino si kya ddala nnyo.
However, it will be dangerous.	Kyokka kijja kuba kya bulabe.
We just need to be better.	Twetaaga kubeera bulungi kyokka.
He is so much more than that.	Asinga nnyo ekyo.
You are my brother.	Ggwe muganda wange.
I was a teacher.	Nnali musomesa.
It’s really very dangerous.	Ddala bulabe nnyo.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
Or he wanted me to know, maybe.	Oba yali ayagala mmanyi, mpozzi.
You’re just afraid he’s too young.	Otya kyokka nti muto nnyo.
Throughout the city.	Mu kibuga kyonna.
You can talk, you can talk, you can talk.	Osobola okwogera, osobola okwogera, osobola okwogera.
But you can’t stay.	Naye tosobola kusigala.
It’s not good at all.	Si kirungi n’akatono.
In fact, not at all.	Mu butuufu, si bwe kiri n’akatono.
He was lucky, he knew.	Yalina omukisa, yali akimanyi.
It was a good thing though.	Kyali kintu kirungi wadde.
Now he knew.	Kati yali amanyi.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
But he's really good.	Naye ddala mulungi.
It’s easy and convenient.	Kyangu era kirungi.
I really like those.	Njagala nnyo ebyo.
He can see something early.	Asobola okulaba ekintu nga bukyali.
He thought in weeks.	Yalowooza mu wiiki.
Nothing is going to happen.	Tewali kigenda kubaawo.
You want to, too.	Naawe oyagala.
No problem there, either.	Tewali buzibu awo, era.
But he doesn’t want to be here.	Naye tayagala kubeera wano.
He couldn’t work.	Yali tasobola kukola.
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
You won’t see clearly.	Tojja kulaba bulungi.
In fact, they were best friends.	Mu butuufu, baali ba mukwano nnyo.
It was hard to go.	Kyali kizibu okugenda.
What a perfect place.	Nga kifo kituufu.
That doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
She is a lovely woman.	Ye mukyala ayagala ennyo.
I can’t do anything about it.	Nze sirina kye nsobola kukola.
There was something he didn’t like.	Waliwo ekintu kye yali tayagala.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
Someone else should know that.	Ekyo omuntu omulala yandibadde akimanyi.
He likes to talk openly about everything.	Ayagala nnyo okwogera mu lwatu ku buli kimu.
This is a matter of opinion.	Eno nsonga ya ndowooza.
He was close to her.	Yali kumpi naye.
We will win.	Tujja kuwangula.
You make the call.	Ggwe okola essimu.
It was time to move on.	Kyali kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
I won’t believe it.	Sijja kukkiriza.
I don’t know, actually.	Simanyi, mu butuufu.
That was the way it was.	Eyo ye yali engeri gye kyali.
There is no answer here.	Wano tewali kuddamu.
It doesn't matter.	Si kikulu.
But what exactly?.	Naye ddala otya?.
He didn’t want to make friends.	Yali tayagala kukola mukwano.
Now you can’t at all.	Kati tosobola n’akatono.
He thought it was a good thing.	Yalowooza nti kyali kintu kirungi.
We are in no hurry.	Tetulina bwangu bwonna.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
But that was fine.	Naye ekyo kyali kirungi.
I have a lot of that.	Nnina bingi ebyo.
He knew he needed help.	Yali akimanyi nti yeetaaga obuyambi.
He wanted to go home.	Yali ayagala kudda waka.
All very long ago now.	Byonna dda nnyo kati.
Either that or nothing.	Oba ekyo oba tewali kintu kyonna.
He was better than that.	Yali asinga ekyo.
No, it’s not true.	Nedda, si kituufu.
But, that’s all he told me.	Naye, ekyo kyokka kye yang’amba.
I don’t know what to do.	Simanyi kya kukola.
But we also don’t have a relationship.	Naye era tetulina mukwano.
He won't get lucky, but there you go.	Tajja kufuna mukisa, naye awo gyoli.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
It’s important to me.	Kikulu gyendi.
This is definitely not true for me.	Kino mazima ddala si kituufu gyendi.
I was more nervous than he was.	Nze nnali ntya nnyo okusinga ye.
Not that he was very dangerous.	Si nti yali wa bulabe nnyo.
Reading about it won’t do it.	Okusoma ku nsonga eyo tekijja kukikola.
I’m a little busy.	Nze ndi bbize katono.
We’ll have to see.	Tujja kuba tulina okulaba.
I actually know this.	Mu butuufu kino nkimanyi.
He didn’t deserve that.	Ekyo yali tasaanidde.
You have to know how hard this is for me.	Olina okumanya engeri kino gye kizibu gyendi.
He doesn’t want to be alone.	Tayagala kubeera yekka.
But that would be too easy.	Naye ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
You can be a person.	Oyinza okuba omuntu.
That’s all you need to know.	Ekyo kyokka kye olina okumanya.
But it’s really important.	Naye ddala kikulu.
You can do that well.	Ekyo oyinza okukikola obulungi.
He works harder than anyone we have.	Akola nnyo okusinga omuntu yenna gwe tulina.
But, not really.	Naye, si ddala.
He was afraid of something like this happening today.	Yali atya ekintu nga kino okubaawo leero.
It’s there or it’s not.	Kiri awo oba si bwe kiri.
It’s happening all the time.	Kigenda mu maaso buli kiseera.
I feel like I’m working hard.	Mpulira nga nkola nnyo.
I think he did pretty well, actually.	Ndowooza yakola bulungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
How are you.	Oli otya.
I can’t even do that.	Ekyo sisobola na kukikola.
It's not good at all.	Si kirungi n'akatono.
I actually thought that was the problem.	Mu butuufu nnalowooza nti ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
I hope everyone.	Nsuubira buli muntu.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
You’re the best man at the job.	Ggwe musajja asinga ku mulimu.
I’m willing to do that.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola ekyo.
I wasn’t sure you would.	Nnali sikakasa nti ojja kukikola.
He certainly didn’t want to go back to prison.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala kudda mu kkomera.
Of course, of course.	Kya lwatu, kya lwatu.
But he was a good man.	Naye yali musajja mulungi.
Everyone thinks you can do so much.	Buli omu alowooza nti osobola okukola bingi nnyo.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
This to me is not love.	Kino gyendi si kwagala.
I don’t know myself.	Nze kennyini simanyi.
I can’t do well.	Sisobola kukola bulungi.
It’s not a matter of luck.	Si nsonga ya mukisa.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
It’s up to me.	Kiri ku nze.
You know what it was like back then.	Omanyi bwe kyali mu kiseera ekyo.
I think it’s really important.	Ndowooza nti kikulu nnyo ddala.
And he wants to know.	Era ayagala okumanya.
I work in movies.	Nkola mu firimu.
It is exactly what it is.	Kye kiri ddala.
It’s easy to see the problem here.	Kyangu okulaba obuzibu wano.
I’m sure I am.	Nkakasa nti ndi.
I’ve always thought about it.	Bulijjo mbadde ndowooza ku nsonga eyo.
We don’t have time.	Tetulina budde.
Drawing is very simple.	Okukuba ekifaananyi kyangu nnyo.
That’s good to know.	Ekyo kirungi okumanya.
He just wants to be something.	Ayagala kubeera kintu kyokka.
We don’t have time to go into that.	Tetulina budde kugenda mu ekyo.
I know what he told me.	Nze kye yang’amba nkimanyi.
We certainly will.	Mazima ddala tujja kukikola.
But he’s still there.	Naye akyali awo.
Glad to read that you are doing well.	Musanyufu okusoma nti okola bulungi.
It’s much more complicated than that.	Kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
Now you have to do it.	Kati olina okukikola.
We couldn’t believe it.	Twali tetusobola kukkiriza.
I know not everyone can do this.	Nkimanyi si buli muntu nti asobola okukola kino.
I want to stay with you, tonight.	Njagala kusigala naawe, ekiro kino.
I want to talk to you.	Njagala okwogera naawe.
And it is very true.	Era kituufu nnyo.
There is no room for him on the floor.	Tewali kifo kya ye wansi.
Just like that other guy did.	Nga ggaayi oyo omulala bwe yakola.
And it is this.	Era kye kino.
I don’t know what to do about it.	Simanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo.
It may be important to you.	Kiyinza okuba nga kye kikulu gy’oli.
We were really good friends.	Ddala twali ba mukwano nnyo.
It’s exactly the same.	Kye kimu ddala.
There is nothing there.	Tewali kintu kyonna awo.
I think you could win there.	Ndowooza oyinza okuwangula eyo.
But there is nothing to see.	Naye tewali kya kulaba.
Maybe, he said.	Mpozzi, bwe yagambye.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
And yes, he probably would.	Era ye, oboolyawo yandikoze.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Si kintu kyangu kukola.
It will be true.	Kijja kuba kituufu.
I love that picture.	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi ekyo.
This seems realistic.	Kino kirabika nga kya ddala.
It's easy there.	Kyangu eyo.
I know you have one.	Nkimanyi nti olina emu.
And this is the case.	Era kino bwe kiri.
This thing had everything.	Ekintu kino kyalina buli kimu.
For both of them.	Ku bombi.
That’s pretty normal.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo kya bulijjo.
Now he's the guy.	Kati ye ggaayi.
We need to help.	Twetaaga okuyamba.
You have .	Olina .
That will always be true.	Ekyo kijja kuba kituufu bulijjo.
Not too long ago.	Si bbanga ddene nnyo emabega.
That seems absolutely true.	Ekyo kirabika kituufu ddala.
However, it would be very difficult.	Kyokka, kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
They were lucky.	Baali ba mukisa.
And you can	Era osobola .
He'll be back, he said.	Ajja kudda, bwe yagambye.
To know very well, that is not the case.	Okumanya obulungi ennyo, ekyo si bwe kiri.
She had no choice but to go with him.	Yali talina kya kukola okuggyako okugenda naye.
Perhaps he has.	Oboolyawo alina.
I can’t find anything.	Sisobola kufuna kintu kyonna.
In reality, however, this can be quite difficult.	Kyokka, mu butuufu kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
Now you want money too.	Kati naawe oyagala ssente.
I know .	Mmanyi .
You’re doing well here.	Okola bulungi wano.
And there it is.	Era eyo.
But nothing seems right.	Naye tewali kirabika nga kituufu.
That, of course, he was.	Ekyo, ddala, kye yali.
This was not what he expected.	Kino si kye yali asuubira.
Probably too many.	Oboolyawo bingi nnyo.
It’s actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
That’s not a bad thing at all.	Ekyo si kibi n’akatono.
And to me, too.	Era ne gyendi.
I know exactly how it is.	Nze mmanyi bulungi bwe kiri.
He will want to know what they are.	Ajja kwagala okumanya kye bali.
But it doesn’t matter, really.	Naye si kikulu, ddala.
That is the difficult thing.	Ekyo kye kintu ekizibu.
He knows he is a child.	Akimanyi nti mwana muto.
He wanted a school.	Yali ayagala ssomero.
As we should be.	Nga bwe tusaanidde okuba.
I'm not sure what it is where.	Sikakasa kiki kye bali wa.
I don’t have time for that.	Ekyo sirina budde.
I won’t be like you.	Sijja kuba nga ggwe.
In every .	Mu buli .
Being good.	Okubeera kirungi.
It can take many forms.	Kiyinza okubeera mu ngeri nnyingi.
It was a beautiful sight.	Kyali kirungi nnyo okulaba.
And this is important.	Era kino kikulu.
And he doesn’t have it either.	Era naye talina.
That was on a week ago.	Ekyo kyali ku wiiki emu emabega.
It won’t matter.	Tekijja kuba kikulu.
No one wanted to be there.	Tewali yali ayagala kubeerawo.
But not much.	Naye si bingi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
Anyone here can do that.	Omuntu yenna wano asobola okukola ekyo.
That’s all he said and it was true.	Ekyo kyokka kye yayogera era kyali kituufu.
I am so glad he came.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti yajja.
Everything was dangerous.	Buli kimu kyali kya bulabe.
What we need now is time.	Kye twetaaga kati kye kiseera.
He belongs to all of us.	Ye wa ffe ffenna.
I love all of her products and always have.	Njagala nnyo ebintu bye byonna era bulijjo nnina.
But no one really does.	Naye ddala tewali akikola.
He was in the same room.	Yali mu kisenge kimu.
Within an hour, we were on our way.	Mu ssaawa emu, twali tugenda.
He likes to be alone doing his work.	Ayagala nnyo okubeera yekka ng’akola omulimu gwe.
Now, that’s true.	Kati, ekyo kituufu.
Not that he had a problem.	Si nti yali alina ekizibu.
Everyone has to recycle.	Buli muntu alina okuddamu okukola ebintu.
I want to be alone.	Njagala kubeera nzekka.
It’s at work.	Kiri ku mulimu.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
You want to.	Oyagala.
I’m not the only one who has an opinion on this.	Si nze nzekka alina endowooza ku nsonga eno.
All at any given time.	Byonna mu kiseera kyonna.
I wanted to be there.	Nnali njagala kubeerawo.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
I'm really sorry about this.	Nze ddala nsonyiwa ku nsonga eno.
They were both friends.	Bombi baali ba mukwano.
You’ve only been here a short time.	Obadde wano akaseera katono ddala.
And we can achieve this together.	Era tusobola okutuuka ku mbeera eno nga tuli wamu.
Not really .	Nedda ddala .
Or tried to do it.	Oba yagezaako okukikola.
I love the job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu.
He had one brother.	Yalina muganda we omu.
He would be right.	Yandibadde wa nsonga.
This can definitely.	Kino kiyinza ddala.
This thing won’t go away.	Ekintu kino tekijja kugenda.
You won’t be able to see anyone without it.	Tojja kusobola kulaba muntu yenna nga tolina.
I hope you’re not too strong.	Nsuubira nti tolina nnyo maanyi.
He speaks very well to everyone.	Ayogera bulungi nnyo eri buli muntu.
But, probably not.	Naye, oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
He lives on his watch.	Abeera ku ssaawa ye.
That’s quite true, actually.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo, mu butuufu.
And you are actually here.	Era mu butuufu oli wano.
It’s just too complicated.	Kizibu nnyo kyokka.
But of course that’s not true.	Naye ddala ekyo si kituufu.
I wonder who is better.	Nze nneebuuza ani asinga.
Everything was going to be difficult.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda kuba kizibu.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
You have to see someone .	Olina okulaba omuntu .
There is definitely something for everyone.	Mazima ddala buli muntu alina ky’alina.
It’s going to be great.	Kigenda kuba kirungi nnyo.
But it was true, you know.	Naye kyali kituufu, omanyi.
But not immediately.	Naye si mu bwangu.
But there was no one.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna.
But for a while, of course.	Naye okumala akaseera, mazima ddala.
And he did it well too.	Era naye yakikola bulungi.
It’s not just this.	Si kino kyokka.
I won’t be there.	Sijja kubeerawo.
If he had a reason he would.	Singa yalina ensonga lwaki yandibadde.
He was on to something.	Yali ku kintu.
That is who we are to each other.	Oyo kye tuli eri buli omu.
I’m a man.	Nze ndi musajja.
I am everything with him.	Nze buli kintu kyonna naye.
He had been lucky.	Yali abadde wa mukisa.
For a while.	Okumala akaseera.
He was the best.	Ye yali asinga obulungi.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
This was really quite simple.	Kino ddala kyali kyangu nnyo.
He doesn’t think he can do it.	Talowooza nti asobola okukikola.
That was it, probably.	Ekyo kye kyali, oboolyawo.
But, not really.	Naye, si ddala.
That’s what my father told me.	Bw’atyo taata bwe yang’amba.
He’s not talking about it.	Si y’ayogera ku nsonga eyo.
From school to now.	Okuva ku ssomero okutuuka kati.
I think you would like it.	Ndowooza wandyagadde.
It’s not my job tonight.	Si mulimu gwange ekiro kino.
Everyone has to do that.	Buli muntu alina okukola ekyo.
I'll come with you.	Nja kujja nange.
I don’t know your plan.	Simanyi nteekateeka yo.
He knew what this was.	Yali amanyi kino kye kyali.
I could always talk myself out of that one.	Bulijjo nnali nsobola okwogera nzekka okuva mu oyo.
I guess it had.	Ntebereza nti kyalina.
This is just for me.	Kino kyange nzekka.
You know that it is.	Omanyi nti bwe kiri.
And it’s not just for me.	Era si gyendi nzekka.
He thought that would happen.	Yalowooza nti ekyo kijja kubaawo.
You’re going to do well.	Ogenda kukola bulungi.
Not this, not now.	Si kino, si kati.
He hopes no one can see.	Asuubira nti tewali asobola kulaba.
We have to think in the moment.	Tulina okulowooza mu kiseera kino.
That was a really hard time for me.	Ekyo ddala kyali kiseera kizibu gyendi.
You can do it.	Osobola okukola.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
True, but very difficult.	Kituufu, naye kizibu nnyo.
He will do it.	Ajja kukikola.
Now, he can’t play at all.	Kati, tasobola kuzannya n’akatono.
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
To him .	Eri ye .
They were his friends.	Baali mikwano gye.
It may be true.	Kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
Probably none at all.	Oboolyawo tewali n’akatono.
And as you .	Era nga ggwe .
And you have to do it.	Era olina okukikola.
I guess that’s a good thing.	Ntebereza nti ekyo kintu kirungi.
I can do this with you, or without you.	Kino nsobola okukikola naawe, oba nga tolina.
I am definitely not a morning person.	Mazima ddala siri muntu wa makya.
This was going to be bad.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kibi.
That’s what we were.	Ekyo kye twali ffe.
It’s not necessarily true.	Si kituufu nti kituufu.
We will do what we have to.	Tujja kukola kye tulina.
But now he was very strong.	Naye kati yali wa maanyi nnyo.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
This was as it should be.	Kino kyali nga bwe kyandibadde.
Unusual.	Si kya bulijjo.
But it is not the truth.	Naye si kye kituufu.
He obviously didn't want to do that.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo yali tayagala kukikola.
He is happy to be here.	Musanyufu okubeera wano.
We are in a difficult time now.	Tuli mu kiseera kizibu kati.
I'm not sure anyone does.	Sikakasa nti waliwo akola.
It will be much easier.	Kijja kuba kyangu nnyo.
That was all it was.	Ekyo kyokka kye kyali.
My father is not with him.	Taata wange tali naye.
My father came too.	Taata naye yajja.
However, you will probably be happy.	Kyokka osanga ojja kuba musanyufu.
The dog on it.	Embwa ku yo.
I feel scared.	Mpulira nga ntya.
Almost to himself.	Kumpi eri ye kennyini.
He says he can.	Agamba nti asobola.
No, we don't have it.	Nedda tetulina.
I want to know everything.	Njagala kumanya buli kimu.
Everything will be fine, tomorrow.	Buli kimu kijja kuba kirungi, enkya.
This he had.	Kino yalina.
He had a good personality.	Yalina omuntu omulungi.
But he has his reasons.	Naye alina ensonga ze.
Now is not the time.	Kati si kye kiseera.
I can do anything knowing that.	Nsobola okukola ekintu kyonna nga mmanyi ekyo.
He would have done it.	Yandikoze.
I still don’t know.	N’okutuusa kati simanyi.
But here we all are.	Naye wano ffenna tuli.
In fact, it can be quite powerful.	Mu butuufu, kiyinza okuba nga kya maanyi nnyo.
It was himself.	Yali ye kennyini.
My point being .	Ensonga yange nga .
No reply yet.	Tewali kuddamu n'okutuusa kati.
But he is very good.	Naye mulungi nnyo.
And, that will be a good feeling.	Era, eyo ejja kuba mpulira nnungi.
You’re doing well.	Okola bulungi.
He didn’t like it very much.	Yali tayagala nnyo.
We are all the same to them.	Ffenna tuli kimu gye bali.
If he did .	Singa yakikola .
How easy it is to say that.	Nga kyangu okwogera ekyo.
You are what it is.	Ggwe kye kiri.
We have to talk again tomorrow.	Tulina okuddamu okwogera enkya.
Thus he could not see anything.	Bwatyo yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
I love doing that.	Njagala nnyo okukola ekyo.
Not now, and not always.	Si kati, era si bulijjo.
He is his only child.	Ye mwana we yekka.
It’s actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
He was already gone.	Yali yagenda dda.
And that’s a powerful idea.	Era eyo ndowooza ya maanyi.
In fact, it was awful.	Mu butuufu, kyali kibi nnyo.
I have to be me.	Nnina okubeera nze.
For a long time he thought that was true.	Okumala ebbanga ddene yali alowooza nti ekyo kituufu.
No one knows.	Tewali muntu yenna amanyi.
As indeed he came, so shall he go.	Nga bwe yajja ddala, bw’atyo ajja kugenda.
I wanted to move on.	Nnali njagala kugenda mu maaso.
Ya got a lot of time.	Ya yafuna obudde bungi.
He was going to try to talk.	Yali agenda kugezaako okwogera.
He thought like us.	Yali alowooza nga ffe.
She is very efficient, effective and friendly.	Akola bulungi nnyo, akola bulungi era wa mukwano.
Everyone does it.	Buli omu akikola.
Everything is fine now.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi kati.
We’ll stay here.	Tujja kusigala wano.
I know what it is like.	Nze mmanyi bwe kiri.
How well that we deserve.	Nga kirungi nnyo ekyo kye tusaanidde.
Please don’t say anything about it.	Nsaba tolina kwogera kintu kyonna ku nsonga eno.
He hasn't spoken yet.	Tannaba kwogera.
It was a beautiful night.	Ekiro kyali kirungi nnyo.
He wanted another one.	Yali ayagala nnyo omulala.
And that’s the problem.	Era ekyo kye kizibu.
That’s not really the case.	Ekyo mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
I like to talk back.	Njagala nnyo okwogera emabega.
It doesn’t matter, he said.	Si kikulu, bwe yagambye.
Nothing could be more important than that.	Tewali kintu kyonna kiyinza kuba kikulu okusinga ekyo.
She looked great .	Yalabika bulungi nnyo .
It seems so real.	Kirabika nga kya ddala nnyo.
He was a lot like you.	Yali nnyo nga ggwe.
You are or you are not.	Oli oba toli.
It would be difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
It is not the case now.	Si bwe kiri kati.
He started in the front.	Yatandika mu maaso.
I was thinking of you.	Nze nali ndowooza ku ggwe.
It doesn’t get any easier than that.	Si kyangu okusinga ekyo.
And it’s really not bad.	Era ddala si kibi.
I really wanted to.	Nze ddala nnali njagala.
It’s a good idea, but there’s a problem.	Kirowoozo kirungi naye waliwo ekizibu.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
Will buy almost anything.	Ajja kugula kumpi buli kimu.
I'm not going.	Sigenda.
I'm not sure what your opinion is.	Sikakasa ndowooza yo ki.
He wanted to help.	Yali ayagala okuyamba.
Not that he would be.	Si nti yandibadde bw’atyo.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
There is a lot of money behind this.	Waliwo ssente nnyingi emabega wa kino.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
One could not say that.	Omuntu yali tasobola kwogera ekyo.
Not because of the car.	Si lwa mmotoka.
He had to know how that could happen.	Yalina okumanya engeri ekyo gye kyali kiyinza okubaawo.
This house is mine now.	Ennyumba eno yange kati.
And that’s very difficult.	Era ekyo kizibu nnyo.
My boyfriend will be there.	Muganzi wange ajja kubeerawo.
I don’t want that and neither do you.	Ekyo saagala era naawe naawe toyagala.
He wanted to talk to her.	Yali ayagala okwogera naye.
And it was with him.	Era kyali naye.
You don't have to come with.	Tolina kujja na.
I’m going to wait in the back.	Ngenda kulinda emabega.
He doesn’t have to do that.	Ekyo talina kukikola.
But that’s what it is now.	Naye ekyo kye kiri kati.
He can’t do anything.	Tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
I hope he gets one soon.	Nsuubira nti mu bbanga ttono ajja kufuna emu.
This plan is real.	Enteekateeka eno ya ddala.
He would do everything right from now on.	Buli kimu yandikoze bulungi okuva kati.
He was so happy, so happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo, nga musanyufu nnyo.
And he could talk.	Era yali asobola okwogera.
What you knew.	Kye wali okimanyi.
And maybe he was.	Era mpozzi nga bwe yali.
This was bad she thought.	Kino kyali kibi bwe yalowooza.
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
We desperately need this going forward.	Kino twetaaga nnyo okugenda mu maaso.
He knew this would come, and he was ready.	Yali amanyi nti kino kijja kujja, era yali mwetegefu.
You can live on a man.	Osobola okubeera ku musajja.
What you want to do.	Kye oyagala okukola.
He couldn’t go anywhere.	Yali tasobola kugenda yonna.
That’s a terrible thing.	Ekyo kibi nnyo.
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
He couldn’t tell.	Yali tasobola kumanya.
For a while no one spoke.	Okumala akaseera nga tewali yayogera.
At the time as well.	Ku kiseera nga bwe kiri.
He was very good to me.	Yali mulungi nnyo gyendi.
I know everything.	Nze buli kimu nkimanyi.
He didn't want to say anything.	Yali tayagala kwogera kintu kyonna.
Not too bad here.	Si kibi nnyo wano.
It may or may not work.	Kiyinza okukola oba obutakola.
It will go away.	Kijja kugenda.
I’m not at all.	Nze siri n’akatono.
I couldn’t play.	Nnali sisobola kuzannya.
Beautiful too.	Omulungi naye.
I have to go to class.	Nnina okugenda mu kibiina.
Like everyone else.	Nga buli muntu yenna.
He's going today.	Agenda leero.
He was everywhere.	Yali buli wamu.
That’s dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe.
And he didn’t know.	Era yali tamanyi.
No issues, no continuity.	Tewali nsonga, tewali kugenda mu maaso.
I will not allow it to happen.	Sijja kukkiriza kubaawo.
He had his own way.	Yalina engeri ye.
And that, perhaps, is a good thing.	Era ekyo, oboolyawo, kintu kirungi.
But he is very close to this.	Naye ali kumpi nnyo ne kino.
He said every time.	Yagambye buli lwe...
It will be much easier.	Kijja kuba kyangu nnyo.
My father was a teacher.	Taata yali musomesa.
He always could.	Bulijjo yali asobola.
It’s a great hospital.	Kye ddwaaliro ddene nnyo.
We will help.	Tujja kuyamba.
And it’s very difficult.	Era kizibu nnyo.
And he is my friend.	Era gwe mukwano gwange.
It was so close.	Yali kumpi nnyo.
And this can be about anything you want to do.	Era kino kiyinza okuba ku kintu kyonna ky’oyagala okukola.
I’m fine with it.	Nze ndi bulungi.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
And yet, nothing.	Era naye, tewali kintu kyonna.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
But it’s very common.	Naye nga kya bulijjo nnyo.
My guy loved it, it's good.	Ggaayi wange yali ayagala nnyo, kirungi.
I think he was really afraid.	Ndowooza ddala yali atya.
It’s true for me.	Kituufu gyendi.
That’s not what you want to see.	Si ekyo ky’oyagala okulaba.
He doesn’t know who.	Tamanyi ani.
I won’t have a problem in my house.	Sijja kufuna buzibu mu nnyumba yange.
We have a great tomorrow.	Tulina enkya ennyo.
But it’s just something for me.	Naye kintu kyokka gyendi.
We are here to help.	Tuli wano okuyamba.
And yes, it is.	Era ye, bwe kiri.
Me and you.	Nze naawe.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
He doesn’t want that.	Ekyo tayagala.
It’s just that.	Kiri kyokka.
You can go swimming every day.	Osobola okugenda okuwuga buli lunaku.
There isn’t anything at all.	Tewali n’akatono.
He came to my class.	Yajja mu kibiina kyange.
But this is dangerous work.	Naye kino mulimu gwa bulabe.
It is certainly very important today.	Mazima ddala kikulu nnyo leero.
We’re going to do it.	Tugenda kukikola.
I have no idea where the problem is.	Sirina kirowoozo nti obuzibu buli wa.
He didn’t know.	Yali tamanyi.
He is a man who can get things done.	Ye musajja asobola okufuna ebintu.
He did something to her.	Yakola ekintu ku ye.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I don’t want to be with you anymore.	Saagala kuddamu kubeera naawe.
I'm sorry, now.	Nsonyiwa, kati.
He probably should have gone.	Oboolyawo yandibadde agenda.
You don’t have it.	Tolina.
He can do it.	Asobola okukola.
He dials down the phone.	Akuba essimu wansi.
But this seems too serious.	Naye kino kirabika nga kya maanyi nnyo.
Although there is one issue.	Wadde nga waliwo ensonga emu.
This is a real job.	Guno mulimu gwa ddala.
But you have a chance.	Naye olina omukisa.
Approximately.	Okutuuka ku.
This is all good as far as it goes.	Kino kyonna kirungi okutuuka we kigenda.
But there’s a point to that.	Naye waliwo ensonga ku ekyo.
I think he probably knew.	Ndowooza osanga yali akimanyi.
Who does it the fastest.	Ani asinga okukikola amangu.
But he knew he couldn't do that.	Naye yali akimanyi nti ekyo tayinza kukikola.
He has no plans.	Talina nteekateeka yonna.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
He says a lot.	Ayogera bingi.
Or anyone really.	Oba omuntu yenna ddala.
He started to move forward.	Yatandika okugenda mu maaso.
I’m sorry, but to the average person, that’s not realistic.	Nsonyiwa naye eri omuntu wa bulijjo, ekyo si kya ddala.
Speech is an essential part of being human.	Okwogera kintu kikulu nnyo mu kubeera omuntu.
But there was nothing to do but do it.	Naye nga tewali kya kukola okuggyako okukikola.
You have to go.	Olina okugenda.
I can’t now though.	Sisobola kati wadde.
I thought it was time.	Nalowooza nti kye kiseera.
You could go much further.	Oyinza okugenda mu maaso nnyo.
Or perhaps there was a reason.	Oba oboolyawo nga waliwo ensonga.
You are really him.	Ddala oli ye.
Or, he knew.	Oba, yali amanyi.
Not this .	Si kino .
I work out of my office.	Nkola nga sirina ofiisi yange.
I love to talk.	Njagala nnyo okwogera.
It’s not my place, he said.	Si kifo kyange, bwe yagambye.
You have this.	Kino olina.
It was the right thing to say.	Kyali kituufu okwogera.
Here, it is exactly the same.	Wano, kye kimu ddala.
It's pretty bad though.	Kibi nnyo wadde.
He said that.	Yayogera bw’atyo.
I have to leave the house for an hour.	Nnina okuva mu nnyumba okumala essaawa emu.
I'll be fine here.	Nja kuba bulungi wano.
But he was afraid.	Naye yali atya.
Maybe it isn’t.	Mpozzi nga si bwe kiri.
It was probably just a problem.	Oboolyawo kyali kizibu kyokka.
I’m willing to work on that, though.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola ku ekyo, wadde.
He looks good to me, so far.	Alabika bulungi gyendi, okutuuka wano.
I think he wanted to see what would happen.	Ndowooza yali ayagala kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
To do it again.	Okuddamu okukikola.
He works very, very hard.	Akola nnyo nnyo.
It’s what he really is.	Kye ddala ky’ali.
I think now no one knows.	Ndowooza kati tewali amanyi.
Every morning.	Buli ku makya.
I hope everything is okay.	Nsuubira nti buli kimu kiri bulungi.
It’s not even an opinion.	Si wadde ndowooza.
I’m an ordinary guy.	Nze ndi ggaayi wa bulijjo.
Apparently he had trouble doing so.	Kirabika yafuna obuzibu okukikola.
This is simply not true.	Kino kyokka si kituufu.
I couldn’t eat.	Nnali sisobola kulya.
You are not in a position to go anywhere.	Toli mu mbeera ya kugenda yonna.
No one asked for help.	Tewali muntu yenna yasaba buyambi.
That’s not the point.	Eyo si y’ensonga.
Food at the house.	Emmere ku nnyumba.
But he came up with nothing.	Naye yajja nga talina ky’alina.
He just won’t do it.	Ye kyokka tajja kukikola.
In every way.	Mu buli ngeri.
But there was nothing he could do.	Naye nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola.
He is a very young child.	Ye mwana muto nnyo.
He has to go.	Alina okugenda.
And we all go with him.	Era ffenna tugenda naye.
It seems almost no one knows about this place.	Kirabika kumpi tewali amanyi ku kifo kino.
You should be here, but not for long.	Olina okubeera wano, naye si kumala bbanga ddene.
It’s a serious issue for me.	Ensonga ya maanyi gyendi.
You have to make a plan.	Olina okukola enteekateeka.
You have it, too.	Naawe olina.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
And you are the one.	Era ggwe oli omu.
I’m sure he was asleep.	Nkakasa nti yali yeebase.
Everyone had to do the same thing.	Buli omu yalina okukola ekintu kye kimu.
So are we, my friend.	Naffe bwe tuli mukwano gwange.
That’s a little complicated.	Ekyo kizibu katono.
It will be easier to do now.	Kijja kuba kyangu okukola kati.
No, this is not urgent.	Nedda, kino si kya mangu.
That would be his office.	Eyo yandibadde ofiisi ye.
You have to work.	Olina okukola.
It is very close.	Kiri kumpi nnyo.
I’m thinking about you.	Nze ndowooza ku ggwe.
This is what he wanted.	Kino yali ayagala.
It looks good.	Kirabika kirungi.
I have to do something you love.	Nnina okukola ekintu ky’oyagala ennyo.
Last week was pretty good.	Wiiki ewedde yali nnungi nnyo.
What to do with it? 	Okukola ki?
It’s actually quite true.	Mu butuufu kituufu nnyo.
And he felt that .	Era yawulira nti .
It was the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu.
Now he can't talk.	Kati tasobola kwogera.
He wants nothing from me this afternoon.	Tayagala kintu kyonna okuva gyendi akawungeezi ka leero.
I know, she thought.	Nkimanyi, bwe yalowooza.
Maybe he’s just in us.	Mpozzi nga ali mu ffe yekka.
Honestly, there’s not much time for that.	Mu butuufu, tewali nnyo budde bwa ekyo.
I have no problem with that.	Ekyo sirina buzibu bwonna.
I wanted it, more than anything.	Nnali njagala, okusinga ekintu kyonna.
I think he is in a good place.	Ndowooza ali mu kifo kirungi.
Speaking is easy.	Okwogera kyangu.
Or not, not necessarily.	Oba nedda, si kituufu nti.
Everyone should know better.	Buli muntu yandibadde amanyi bulungi.
It was a great idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
We were in a relationship.	Twali mu mukwano.
We could see nothing, anyway.	Tewali kye twali tusobola kulaba, mu ngeri yonna.
He is a very vulnerable person.	Ye muntu alina obuzibu bungi nnyo.
He wanted to do this right.	Kino yali ayagala kukikola bulungi.
You are a friend.	Oli wa mukwano.
He tried to read her thoughts.	Yagezaako okusoma bye yali alowooza.
I am a woman too.	Nange mukyala.
He had to do it.	Yalina okukikola.
I’m not in your car.	Nze siri mu mmotoka yo.
You will get nothing in return.	Tojja kufuna kintu kyonna mu kuddamu.
I thought he was here.	Nalowooza nti yali wano.
I'll be there all morning.	Nja kubeerawo enkya yonna.
I live with my brother’s wife.	Mbeera ne mukyala wa muganda wange.
It’s not like you.	Si kya nga ggwe.
I knew someone would come.	Nali mmanyi nti waliwo omuntu ajja kujja.
This is not a good idea.	Kino si kirowoozo kirungi.
But in reality this was not the case.	Naye mu butuufu kino si bwe kyali.
And it’s true.	Era kituufu.
No one is here for the money.	Tewali ali wano lwa ssente.
There is no one here but us.	Wano tewali muntu yenna okuggyako ffe.
Here there and everywhere.	Wano awo ne buli wamu.
I don’t know anything about it, really.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo, ddala.
We are in a very good position.	Tuli mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
But not for you.	Naye si lwa ggwe.
He had been sick.	Yali abadde mulwadde.
You want to know, you know.	Oyagala okumanya, omanyi.
But he can’t do it alone.	Naye tasobola kukikola yekka.
It’s very, very simple.	Kyangu nnyo nnyo.
It wasn’t the case.	Si bwe kyali.
No one came with him.	Tewali yajja naye.
Why it’s easy.	Lwaki kyangu.
Nobody needed to know that.	Ekyo tewali yali yeetaaga kumanya.
I know exactly what that is.	Nkimanyi bulungi ekyo bwe kiri.
That’s at the bottom of this whole thing.	Ekyo kiri wansi mu kintu kino kyonna.
Everything was real.	Buli kimu kyali kya ddala.
He knew it was his time.	Yali akimanyi nti kye kiseera kye.
But right now, this is definitely not the reality.	Naye mu kiseera kino, kino ddala si kye kituufu.
This isn’t exactly a bad thing.	Kino si kibi ddala.
It wasn’t the only problem.	Si kye kyali ekizibu kyokka.
We shall see how it is.	Tujja kulaba nga bwe kiri.
And he couldn’t let that happen.	Era ekyo yali tasobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
We will do it again.	Tujja kuddamu okukikola.
But it's really really bad.	Naye ddala ddala kibi.
He will make a move.	Ajja kukola ekintu ekigenda mu maaso.
So much he didn’t know, yet to see.	Bingi nnyo bye yali tamanyi, nga tannaba kulaba.
That doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri.
Almost everyone does it.	Kumpi buli muntu akikola.
What a wonderful idea.	Nga kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
You know that, too.	Ekyo naawe okimanyi.
I hope he doesn’t.	Nsuubira nti tajja kukikola.
That or no time.	Ekyo oba nga tewali budde.
He knew what he was.	Yali amanyi kye yali.
I’ll never know, and that’s fine with me.	Sijja kumanya, era ekyo kirungi gyendi.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
That was a good thing.	Ekyo kyali kirungi.
Now he doesn’t really know who we are.	Kati tamanyi bulungi kye tuli.
But it was very simple.	Naye kyali kyangu nnyo.
Here is a picture.	Wano waliwo ekifaananyi.
It was almost too good to be true.	Kumpi kyali kirungi nnyo.
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
And he knows he has to move on.	Era akimanyi nti alina okugenda mu maaso.
Now he is everyone’s problem.	Kati ye kizibu kya buli muntu.
He is a good friend of mine.	Ye mukwano gwange omulungi.
No one was near him.	Tewali yali kumpi naye.
Really well though.	Ddala bulungi wadde.
And he makes a phone call.	Era akuba essimu.
He always wanted to come here.	Bulijjo yali ayagala kujja wano.
He was practical in that sense.	Yali wa nkola mu ngeri eyo.
And the point isn’t that it’s so hard.	Era ensonga si nti kizibu nnyo.
His brother was everywhere.	Muganda we yali buli wamu.
That’s just not true.	Ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
But you have to go now.	Naye olina okugenda kati.
However, this picture is very simple.	Kyokka ekifaananyi kino kyangu nnyo.
I can’t do this.	Kino sisobola kukikola.
And he's fine.	Era ali bulungi.
But he could do the same.	Naye yali asobola okukola kye kimu.
I’m my own reason.	Nze nsonga yange.
It was a beautiful house.	Yali nnyumba nnungi nnyo.
It was definitely a big deal.	Mazima ddala kyali kikulu nnyo.
It’s important to them.	Kikulu gye bali.
You may have to do this.	Oyinza okuba nga olina okukola kino.
Nothing looks the same to me.	Tewali kirabika kye kimu gyendi.
I'm not so sure.	Sikakasa nnyo.
I am not saying this.	Si nze ayogera bino.
We have the same problem.	Tulina ekizibu kye kimu.
Perhaps he did.	Oboolyawo yakikola.
No one was saying anything.	Tewali yali ayogera kintu kyonna.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
Everyone needs help.	Buli muntu yeetaaga obuyambi.
Certainly not his money.	Mazima ddala si ssente ze.
I was ordinary.	Nze nali wa bulijjo.
That was pretty much what it was.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo kye kyali.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
I'm not even sure what the point is.	Sikakasa na nsonga ki gye kiri.
It’s great to have you here.	Kirungi nnyo okubeera naawe wano.
They were in good shape.	Baali mu mbeera nnungi.
You said there was someone else in the room.	Wagamba nti waliwo omuntu omulala mu kisenge.
I guess he’ll be fine.	Ntebereza nti ajja kuba bulungi.
And it still isn’t.	Era n’okutuusa kati si bwe kiri.
He won’t come home.	Tajja kudda waka.
Everything is going to be fine.	Buli kimu kigenda kuba bulungi.
No one wanted to be here.	Tewali yali ayagala kubeera wano.
I think he did too.	Ndowooza naye yakikola.
And he is strong.	Era wa maanyi.
Not like himself.	Si nga ye kennyini.
I don’t want him to say no.	Saagala agamba nti nedda.
So much for knowing it all.	Bingi nnyo eri okumanya byonna.
Mostly, but not always.	Okusinga, naye si bulijjo.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
I thought it was .	Nalowooza nti yali .
I can’t work as hard as that guy.	Sisobola kukola nnyo nga ggaayi oyo.
Now he thinks he can do the same.	Kati alowooza nti naye asobola okukola kye kimu.
So he tried to think.	Bwatyo yagezaako okulowooza.
It can happen very quickly, and it can happen.	Kiyinza okubaawo amangu ennyo, era kiyinza okubaawo.
Too bad it wasn’t.	Kibi nnyo si bwe kyali.
Very little, little by little.	Katono ddala, katono katono.
And it wasn’t.	Era si bwe kyali.
That’s what he needs.	Ekyo kye yeetaaga.
It’s not like it used to be.	Si nga bwe kyali emabegako.
I don’t really know for sure.	Mu butuufu simanyi bulungi.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
All of that really.	Ebyo byonna ddala.
There is no room for faith.	Tewali kifo kya kukkiriza.
And not for the movie.	Era si lwa firimu.
Or he had been.	Oba yali abadde.
Although it is very simple.	Wadde nga kyangu nnyo.
Who knows exactly.	Ani amanyi ddala.
He will come home.	Ajja kudda awaka.
I wonder who it is.	Nze nneebuuza ani.
It seems like it would be very difficult.	Kirabika nga kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
My wife is my wife.	Mukyala wange ye mukyala wange.
You can leave here tomorrow.	Osobola okuva wano enkya.
And honestly, that doesn’t matter.	Era mu butuufu, ekyo si kikulu.
I will be good at this.	Nja kuba mulungi mu kino.
It is not the case here.	Wano si bwe kiri.
There is no money	Tewali ssente .
And it’s difficult.	Era kizibu.
We all have needs.	Ffenna tulina bye twetaaga.
He said he didn’t have any.	Yagambye nti talina.
No one seems to know about it.	Alabika tewali amanyi ku nsonga eyo.
We’ll be down soon.	Tujja kuba wansi mu bbanga ttono.
And that’s all we need.	Era ekyo kyokka kye twetaaga.
I think you would love it.	Ndowooza wandyagadde nnyo.
I will tell my friend.	Nja kubuulira mukwano gwange.
We have something going almost every day of the week.	Tulina kye tugenda kumpi buli lunaku mu wiiki.
Everyone knew who that one would be.	Buli omu yali amanyi oyo oyo yandibadde ani.
You think about me.	Ggwe ndowooza ku nze.
He knew he would be coming.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kuba ajja.
He was very aware of who he was.	Yali amanyi nnyo ky’ali.
I don’t want anything from anyone.	Saagala kintu kyonna okuva eri omuntu yenna.
And it was in him now.	Era kyali mu ye kati.
He went away for a week.	Yagenda okumala wiiki emu.
. . . .	.
Or his girlfriend.	Oba muganzi we.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
I'm sure of that.	Nze nkakasa nti.
He didn’t have time.	Yali talina budde.
He was finished.	Yali amaze.
He couldn’t be the man she needed.	Yali tasobola kuba musajja gwe yali yeetaaga.
He had no idea what to get anyone.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki ky’alina okufuna omuntu yenna.
He knows where you are.	Amanyi gyoli.
It was now the weekend.	Kati yali wiikendi.
This is my job.	Guno gwe mulimu gwange.
He certainly didn’t know.	Mazima ddala yali tamanyi.
I am really alone.	Ddala ndi nzekka.
He says you can get help.	Agamba nti osobola okufuna obuyambi.
We both deserve it.	Ffembi tusaanidde.
This is not a good idea.	Kino si kirowoozo kirungi.
It is not the case here.	Si bwe kiri wano.
I thought the movie was great.	Nalowooza nti firimu eyo yali nnungi nnyo.
He was just alone.	Yali yekka yekka.
Every man here is like that.	Buli musajja wano bw'atyo.
No, he did not want to see the stranger again.	Nedda, yali tayagala kuddamu kulaba muntu oyo gwe yali tamanyi.
Where is this .	Kino kiri ludda wa .
That’s all that matters.	Ekyo kyokka kye kikulu.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
But it’s not romantic.	Naye si kya mukwano.
I am not sure why this is happening.	Sikakasa lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso.
But here they were.	Naye wano we baali.
There is nothing wrong with this in my opinion.	Kino tewali kibi kyonna mu ndowooza yange.
That’s not a problem for me.	Ekyo si kizibu gyendi.
It seems simple but it isn’t.	Kirabika kyangu naye si bwe kiri.
I love being here.	Njagala nnyo okubeera wano.
I have to be like.	Nze alina okuba nga.
Almost did, too.	Kumpi yakola, era.
It was a wonderful atmosphere.	Yali mbeera nnungi nnyo.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
Maybe a little bit.	Mpozzi nga katono.
You are something .	Oli kintu .
I thought you would win.	Nalowooza nti ojja kuwangula.
Not for anyone.	Si lwa muntu yenna.
You can do that.	Ekyo osobola okukola.
He really didn’t deserve it.	Mu butuufu yali tasaanidde.
It’s okay.	Kiri bulungi.
I'll go right away.	Nja kugenda mangu ddala.
Today that is important, but difficult to do.	Leero ekyo kikulu, naye kizibu okukola.
It doesn’t matter now.	Si kikulu kati.
He is very optimistic.	Alina essuubi nnyo.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
I really wanted to do it.	Nnali njagala nnyo okukikola.
. . . .	.
It’s going to be exactly the same.	Kigenda kuba kye kimu ddala.
But now he was happy.	Naye kati yali musanyufu.
And then it was.	Era awo bwe kyali.
I am sure that .	Nkakasa nti .
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
We have an opinion.	Tulina endowooza.
He wanted help.	Yali ayagala buyambi.
You’ll be here, too.	Ojja kubeera wano, nange.
Hard work is the key.	Okukola ennyo kye kikulu ennyo.
He was thinking of his agenda, his plan.	Yali alowooza ku agenda ye, enteekateeka ye.
But, no, not really.	Naye, nedda, si ddala.
You and my father.	Ggwe ne taata wange.
He is a thing.	Ye kintu.
But there was no one there.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna awo.
It was a thing of beauty.	Kyali kintu kya bulungi.
That’s not like him.	Ekyo si nga ye.
It’s so important, every day.	Kikulu nnyo, buli lunaku.
. . . .	.
He tries to think.	Agezaako okulowooza.
He just had to do it.	Yalina okukikola kyokka.
I know what we can do.	Nze mmanyi kye tusobola okukola.
And he won’t do it.	Era tajja kukikola.
But he had plenty of time.	Naye yalina obudde bungi.
You can be.	Osobola okuba.
I said maybe he would.	Nagamba nti osanga yandikoze.
He certainly doesn’t want that.	Mazima ddala ekyo tayagala.
This is a real problem for me.	Kino kizibu kya ddala gyendi.
I know how important it is.	Nkimanyi nti kikulu nnyo.
I know the guy.	Nze mmanyi ggaayi.
Perhaps it is time for him to act.	Oboolyawo kye kiseera akole.
This will go on for a while.	Kino kijja kugenda mu maaso okumala akaseera.
It worked fine for a while.	Yakola bulungi okumala akaseera.
I thought it was right for me.	Nalowooza nti kyali kituufu gyendi.
I’m so scared.	Nze ntya nnyo.
Not human, he thought.	Si muntu, bwe yalowooza.
He was happy, almost happy.	Yali musanyufu, kumpi musanyufu.
He knew it was true.	Yali akimanyi nti kituufu.
Good fit is very important.	Okutuuka obulungi kikulu nnyo.
It was really intense.	Ddala kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
He did what he did.	Yakola ekyo kye yakola.
A very good friend.	Mukwano omulungi ennyo.
It doesn’t matter, really.	Si nsonga, ddala.
It was mine.	Yali yange.
It’s all about me.	Byonna ku nze.
To this day, no one knows where they are.	N’okutuusa leero, tewali amanyi gye bali.
At the moment it’s not bad.	Mu kiseera kino si kibi.
you think.	ggwe olowooza.
I actually live by that situation.	Mu butuufu mbeera ku mbeera eyo.
Seems to me someone might consider that.	Kirabika gyendi waliwo ayinza okulowooza ku ekyo.
He couldn't help talking.	Yali tasobola kuyamba ku kwogera.
I didn’t know why.	Nnali simanyi lwaki.
Nothing too important though.	Tewali kikulu nnyo wadde.
Every child knows what that is like.	Buli mwana amanyi ekyo bwe kiri.
No, no, no, no, no, no .	Nedda nedda nedda nedda nedda nedda .
I don’t think that’s true.	Ekyo sirowooza nti kituufu.
That’s a bad idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kibi.
This looks good.	Kino kirabika bulungi.
He looked so young.	Yalabika nga muto nnyo.
This is a quick one.	Kino kya bwangu.
Anything goes now.	Ekintu kyonna kigenda kati.
He looked asleep.	Yalabika nga yeebase.
But it was really hard.	Naye ddala kyali kizibu.
That is a very good point for us.	Eyo nsonga nnungi nnyo gye tuli.
It can happen again.	Kiyinza okuddamu okubaawo.
He knew it was.	Yali akimanyi nti bwe kiri.
He couldn’t do that either.	Ekyo naye yali tasobola kukikola.
But that’s on him.	Naye ekyo kiri ku ye.
And that’s terrible.	Era ekyo kibi nnyo.
Mostly both of us.	Okusinga ffembi.
I’m working on that.	Nze nkola ku nsonga eyo.
I was pretty sure.	Nali nkakasa bulungi.
I guess not right now.	Ntebereza nti si mu kiseera kino.
No, it wasn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kyali.
Where he is now.	W’ali kati.
Maybe it’s you.	Mpozzi nga ggwe.
However, he was safe.	Kyokka, yali talina bulabe.
And he knew he was strong.	Era yali akimanyi nti yali wa maanyi.
I was perfectly fine with that.	Ekyo nnali bulungi ddala.
He definitely has a point.	Alina ddala ensonga.
He also saw his wife.	Era yalaba ne mukyala we.
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
You,’ he said.	Ggwe,’ bwe yagamba.
He doesn’t have a job.	Talina mulimu.
And his father.	Ne taata we.
There is no real context in it.	Tewali mbeera ya ddala mu yo.
And not just anyone would, either.	Era si muntu yenna yekka yandikoze, era.
I make sure that thing is mine and mine alone.	Nkakasa nti ekintu ekyo kyange era kyange kyokka.
He is ready as soon as .	Ye mwetegefu amangu ddala nga .
Each looks better than the other.	Buli omu alabika bulungi okusinga omulala.
I was very young.	Nnali muto nnyo.
He doesn’t want no one.	Tayagala tewali muntu yenna.
With nothing important.	Nga tewali kikulu.
It seems to look good.	Kirabika nga kirabika bulungi.
You will be leaving very soon.	Ojja kuba ogenda mu bbanga ttono ddala.
A chance to get anything.	Omukisa okufuna ekintu kyonna.
He’s not just a musician.	Si muyimbi yekka.
I love talking to him.	Njagala nnyo okwogera naye.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
Now he was almost always asleep.	Kati kumpi bulijjo yali yeebase.
That's why.	Eyo y'ensonga lwaki...
He doesn’t know you’re here.	Tamanyi nti oli wano.
I think that’s what it is.	Ndowooza ekyo kye kiri.
He can be with you alone.	Asobola okuba naawe wekka.
Too much vision.	Okulaba ennyo.
He had to be someone who knew the house.	Yalina okuba omuntu amanyi ennyumba.
You will see that it is true.	Ojja kulaba nga kituufu.
I guess it’s great.	Ntebereza nti kirungi nnyo.
And there is nothing wrong with it.	Era tewali kibi kyonna.
Or as good as nothing.	Oba nga kirungi nga tewali kintu kyonna.
Being on time.	Okubeera mu budde.
Until this week.	Okutuusa wiiki eno.
He always says he doesn’t mind.	Bulijjo agamba nti talina buzibu.
This is a good practice.	Eno nkola nnungi.
No one will be there except you.	Tewali muntu yenna ajja kubaawo okuggyako ggwe.
At the time, he was not very interested.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali tayagala nnyo.
That’s how he felt.	Bw’atyo bwe yawulira.
And you are .	Era ggwe oli .
That was a bad thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi.
That’s a great idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
For myself alone.	Ku nze nzekka.
It’s easy on the eyes.	Kyangu ku maaso.
My wife loves it too.	Mukyala wange naye ayagala nnyo.
Who really makes the money.	Ani ddala akola ssente.
She looks absolutely beautiful.	Alabika bulungi ddala.
I guess that might work.	Ntebereza nti ekyo kiyinza okukola.
He lives with us.	Abeera naffe.
And what a powerful room it was.	Era nga kyali kisenge kya maanyi nnyo.
Certainly not for you.	Mazima ddala si gy’oli.
He didn’t want to know who it was.	Yali tayagala kumanya ani.
. . . .	.
He always had time.	Bulijjo yalina obudde.
You belong here, too.	Oli wa wano, nange.
He thought it was too dangerous.	Yalowooza nti kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
It is a place of thought.	Kifo kya ndowooza.
The father said.	Taata bwe yagambye.
Of course, it’s more complicated than this.	Kya lwatu, kizibu okusinga kino.
It seems like he is.	Kirabika nga ye.
He knew so much about it.	Yali amanyi bingi nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
He said he could help.	Yagambye nti asobola okuyamba.
It can happen to anyone.	Kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna.
I can be.	Nsobola okuba.
This was going to be difficult.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kizibu.
I wanted to stay here.	Nnali njagala kusigala wano.
He knew he was there.	Yali akimanyi nti yali awo.
Dad will be back.	Taata ajja kudda.
He had him.	Yalina ye.
He looked good.	Yalabika bulungi.
I certainly don’t want to live or work either.	Mazima ddala nange saagala kubeera oba okukola.
Certainly not such a thing.	Mazima ddala si kintu ng’ekyo.
I said, no, I don't.	Nagamba nti, nedda.
That's why it's important.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki kikulu.
Someone doesn’t have to be here.	Omuntu talina kubeera wano.
I just wonder how good you really are.	Nze nneebuuza kyokka nti ddala oli mulungi.
Visually it looks really good.	Mu kulaba kirabika bulungi ddala.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
And so he did what he knew best.	Era bw’atyo yakola ekyo kye yali asinga okumanya.
That’s not a good idea.	Ekyo si kirowoozo kirungi.
He has to work.	Alina okukola.
In fact, you won’t be able to come.	Mu butuufu, tojja kusobola kujja.
Everyone knows this is what we need.	Buli omu akimanyi nti kino kye twetaaga.
He was willing to do anything.	Yali mwetegefu okukola ekintu kyonna.
Ever since he was a child.	Okuva lwe yali akyali mwana muto.
I wonder if he knows how to talk.	Nze nneebuuza oba amanyi okwogera.
He was better than his wife.	Yali asinga mukyala we.
He does it.	Akikola.
He is here alone.	Ali wano yekka.
He just didn't know what to say.	Yali tamanyi kya kwogera kyokka.
He certainly did.	Mazima ddala yakikola.
It was a wonderful time for both of us.	Kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo gye tuli ffembi.
Maybe that’s the problem.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kizibu.
I can’t quite believe where we are today.	Siyinza bulungi kukkiriza gye tuli leero.
He won’t talk to me.	Tajja kwogera nange.
A lot of reading indeed.	Okusoma nnyo ddala.
I 'm afraid	Nze ntya .
I couldn’t find a job.	Nnali sisobola kufuna mulimu.
He thought only of his father.	Yalowooza ku taata we yekka.
This is not a matter of faith.	Eno si nsonga ya kukkiriza.
This is a patient.	Kino mulwadde.
However, he is.	Kyokka ye bw’atyo.
Not everyone can do well.	Si buli muntu nti asobola okukola obulungi.
And then, well .	Era awo, bulungi .
I love you too.	Naawe njagala nnyo.
I really wanted this.	Kino nnali njagala nnyo.
He’s always been like that.	Bulijjo abadde bw’atyo.
He was thinking.	Yali alowooza.
This is what really matters.	Kino kye kikulu ennyo.
He was the only one.	Ye yali yekka.
I'm going downstairs.	Nze ngenda wansi.
Now you can move on.	Kati osobola okugenda mu maaso.
That’s not what we have.	Ekyo si kye tulina.
He was a very good singer, you know.	Yali muyimbi mulungi nnyo, omanyi.
No work, no opportunity here.	Tewali mulimu, tewali mukisa wano.
And tonight .	Era ekiro kino .
If only he could think.	Singa asobola okulowooza.
But, that wasn’t my point.	Naye, eyo si ye yali ensonga yange.
For my son’s sake.	Ku lwa mwana wange.
It was probably really too easy.	Oboolyawo ddala kyali kyangu nnyo.
I’ll get a job.	Nja kufuna omulimu.
You actually love it.	Mu butuufu oyagala nnyo.
One point, anyway.	Ensonga emu, mu ngeri yonna.
I'm not sure though.	Sikakasa wadde.
Mostly when.	Okusinga nga...
However, this is not the case.	Naye, kino si bwe kiri.
I'm completely sorry.	Nsonyiwa ddala.
Certainly there is.	Mazima ddala waliwo.
He was always just him to me.	Bulijjo yali ye yekka gyendi.
But he isn’t.	Naye si bw’atyo.
And you are not alone.	Era toli wekka.
But not so much right now.	Naye si nnyo mu kiseera kino.
In a way, it was true.	Mu ngeri emu, kyali kituufu.
He like everyone else in that way.	Ye nga buli muntu omulala mu ngeri eyo.
That’s a possibility.	Ekyo kiyinza okubaawo.
Not so in my case.	Si bwe kiri mu mbeera yange.
I wanted to see why.	Nnali njagala okulaba lwaki.
Or in an hour.	Oba mu ssaawa emu.
He has so many opinions.	Alina endowooza nnyingi nnyo.
This is a thing.	Kino kintu.
Apparently he had a lot.	Kirabika yalina bingi.
I have no problem telling anyone at all.	Sirina buzibu kubuulira muntu yenna n’akatono.
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nkola.
I don’t know how to proceed.	Simanyi ngeri gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso.
We don’t have a problem.	Tetulina buzibu.
Now is not the time.	Kati si kye kiseera.
In the same house.	Mu nnyumba emu.
He is a good child.	Ye mwana mulungi.
He is very powerful.	Wa maanyi nnyo.
We just have something.	Tulina ekintu kyokka.
And it’s very important.	Era nga kikulu nnyo.
You're the best!.	Ggwe asinga!.
No one lives there.	Tewali abeera eyo.
I couldn’t see.	Nnali sisobola kulaba.
But that is not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu.
That’s not a bad idea at all.	Ekyo si kirowoozo kibi n’akatono.
You’re in good company, in a way.	Oli mu kibiina kirungi, mu ngeri emu.
That was good to see.	Ekyo kyali kirungi okulaba.
Not even this.	Si wadde kino.
And it was a sin.	Era kyali kibi.
Not like now.	Si nga kati.
However, that may just be me.	Kyokka, ekyo kiyinza okuba nga nze nzekka.
It is a very good idea.	Kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
And not everyone can do that.	Era si buli muntu nti asobola okukola ekyo.
I have to do it.	Nnina okukikola.
I am a lucky man.	Nze ndi musajja wa mukisa.
In fact, nothing could be more difficult.	Mu butuufu, tewali kiyinza kuba kizibu okusinga ekyo.
He will come back, and he will be fine.	Ajja kudda, era ajja kuba bulungi.
He said exactly what he wanted to do.	Yayogera bulungi kye yali ayagala okukola.
I know it was mine.	Nkimanyi nti kyali kyange.
It was a good move.	Yali nkola nnungi.
I'm not quite sure why.	Sikakasa bulungi lwaki.
You were more than my girlfriend.	Ggwe wali okusinga muganzi wange.
We’re going to see a movie tomorrow.	Tugenda kulaba firimu enkya.
This is not the time.	Kino si kye kiseera.
I knew this issue would come up.	Nali mmanyi nti ensonga eno ejja kujja.
Here we are.	Wano we tuli.
Not in this movie.	Si mu firimu eno.
I hope that’s not true.	Nsuubira nti ekyo si kituufu.
Everyone does it their own way.	Buli muntu akikola mu ngeri ye.
Same thing with this and this and this and this.	Ekintu kye kimu ne kino ne kino ne kino ne kino.
It could have been anyone’s room.	Kyandibadde kisenge kya muntu yenna.
I always wanted one.	Bulijjo nnali njagala emu.
He needs time .	Yeetaaga obudde .
But not you and you alone.	Naye si ggwe naawe wekka.
And we can help.	Era tusobola okuyamba.
It seems to be the case.	Kirabika nga bwe kiri.
Obviously, it won’t.	Kya lwatu nti tekijja kukikola.
But, you can’t know.	Naye, tosobola kumanya.
He couldn't quite say why.	Yali tasobola bulungi kwogera lwaki.
Hope everyone is okay.	Essuubi nti buli omu ali bulungi.
He came to me.	Yajja gyendi.
I can’t speak at the moment.	Sisobola kwogera mu kiseera kino.
It is in the congregation.	Eri mu kibiina.
Pretty good, she thought.	Mulungi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
he strikes the point.	akuba ensonga.
It is very important indeed.	Kikulu nnyo ddala.
So he knew.	Bwatyo yali amanyi.
That goes for everyone.	Ekyo kigenda ku buli muntu.
Or actually really .	Oba mu butuufu ddala .
Not like me.	Si nga nze.
Not even a person.	Si wadde omuntu.
And that’s not true.	Era ekyo si kituufu.
Too bad, you can't.	Kibi nnyo, tosobola.
Night comes when no one can work.	Ekiro kijja nga tewali asobola kukola.
And there we were.	Era awo we twali.
She was very nice and friendly about it all.	Yali mulungi nnyo era wa mukwano ku byonna.
Almost every child goes to school.	Kumpi buli mwana agenda ku ssomero.
But he was on to us, apparently.	Naye yali ku ffe, kirabika.
It’s not a real job.	Si mulimu gwa ddala.
And it was pretty fast.	Era kyali kirungi kya bwangu.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
The police are coming.	Poliisi ejja.
You have to get out of here.	Olina okuva wano.
To me it was a really easy thing to do.	Eri nze kyali kintu kyangu ddala okukola.
I have been very busy.	Mbadde bbize nnyo.
Maybe it’s .	Mpozzi nga .
It was absolutely true.	Kyali kya mazima ddala.
I’m sure I won’t.	Nkakasa nti sijja kukikola.
Someone who knows.	Omuntu amanyi.
You have a problem.	Olina ekizibu.
But, that’s not my point.	Naye, eyo si y’ensonga yange.
Everyone does that.	Buli muntu ekyo akikola.
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
No it is not at all.	Nedda si bwe kiri n’akatono.
You are powerless.	Ggwe tolina maanyi.
No' now, in any case.	Nedda' kati, mu mbeera yonna.
I don’t know why he thought that.	Simanyi lwaki yalowooza bw’atyo.
There are so many of these.	Bingi nnyo bino.
But this is nothing.	Naye kino si kintu kyonna.
I don’t think it’s true.	Ndowooza si kituufu.
I don’t really know anything about him.	Mu butuufu sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
You might find something you want.	Oyinza okufuna ekintu ky’oyagala.
And below.	Era wansi.
I'll see if he's here.	Nja kulaba oba ali wano.
And that he is.	Era nti ye.
Very close, very close.	Kumpi nnyo, kumpi nnyo.
But that’s obviously not the case.	Naye ekyo kya lwatu si bwe kiri.
But that’s just not the case.	Naye ekyo kyokka si bwe kiri.
I’ll have dinner with my father at night.	Nja kulya ne taata ekiro.
Quick, quick, quick.	Amangu, amangu, amangu.
No one has ever talked about this.	Tewali muntu yenna abadde ayogera ku nsonga eno.
That’s all that matters now.	Ekyo kyokka kye kikulu kati.
He hoped she couldn't know.	Yalina essuubi nti tasobola kumanya.
He felt it was a powerful moment.	Yawulira nti kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
And it was true.	Era kyali kituufu.
But he was right behind her.	Naye yali emabega we ddala.
And it is you that is.	Era ye ggwe oli.
My wife is with him.	Mukyala wange ali naye.
This would make it easier to do this.	Kino kyandibadde kyangu okukola kino.
He is not in danger.	Tali mu bulabe.
Thought you might help.	Yalowooza nti oyinza okuyamba.
I'm going now.	Nze ngenda kati.
I know a lot.	Nze mmanyi bingi.
Or it will be.	Oba kijja kuba.
I am afraid that .	Ntya nti .
He knows it’s not true.	Akimanyi nti si kituufu.
You don’t have any time now.	Tolina budde bwonna kati.
In fact, there is probably nothing real here for you.	Mu butuufu, oboolyawo wano tewali kintu kyonna kya ddala gy’oli.
Not mine, obviously.	Si yange, kya lwatu.
Nothing is visible.	Tewali kintu kyonna kirabika.
That’s just true.	Ekyo kituufu kyokka.
But for whom?.	Naye ku lwa ani?.
Maybe he had a point.	Mpozzi yalina ensonga.
And for a long time, no one spoke.	Era okumala ebbanga ddene, tewali yali ayogera.
. . . .	.
Not like you.	Si nga ggwe.
He knew it wasn't real, of course.	Yali akimanyi nti si kya ddala, ddala.
I’m not from here.	Nze siri wa wano.
She was really well.	Ddala yali bulungi.
He couldn’t work.	Yali tasobola kukola.
At home he can’t do very well.	Awaka tasobola kukola bulungi nnyo.
That was dangerous.	Ekyo kyali kya bulabe.
I need money.	Ssente nneetaaga.
I am actually very happy.	Mu butuufu ndi musanyufu nnyo.
I need help .	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi .
For the most part, he seems to be sleeping right now.	Okusinga alabika nga yeebase mu kiseera kino.
I always want to be human.	Bulijjo njagala kubeera muntu.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
He was an only child.	Yali mwana yekka.
It’s not a good time for us.	Si kiseera kirungi gye tuli.
He'll be fine, though.	Ajja kuba bulungi, wadde.
In this case, none.	Mu mbeera eno, tewali.
What you love to do.	Kye oyagala ennyo okukola.
This, this is very powerful.	Kino, kino kya maanyi nnyo.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
I have nothing to do with that.	Ekyo sirina kye nnyinza kukola.
Filmmaking is something to behold.	Okukola firimu kintu kya kulaba.
I want to see me do it.	Njagala kulaba nkola.
No.	Nedda.
He wasn't really thinking.	Mu butuufu yali talowooza.
This was probably true.	Kino oboolyawo kyali kituufu.
This was a very important step.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
Not much, either.	Si nnyo, era.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
But you probably already knew that.	Naye osanga ekyo wali okimanyi dda.
The issue is not the issue.	Ensonga si nsonga.
We have to get out of here.	Tulina okuva wano.
Actually, not really.	Mu butuufu, si ddala.
Who was it ?.	Yali ani ?.
Of course, that was not the case.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo si bwe kyali.
I think that’s very important.	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo.
He was thoughtful and that was fine.	Yali alowooza era ekyo kyali kirungi.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
That’s what we’ll do.	Ekyo kye tujja okukola.
He was so happy to be with her.	Yali musanyufu nnyo okubeera naye.
Not always good delivery.	Si bulijjo okutuusa obulungi.
I didn’t know how.	Nnali simanyi ngeri ki.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
He might have seen something .	Yandiba nga waliwo kye yalaba .
It’s not dangerous.	Si kya bulabe.
He saw that there was no way forward.	Yalaba nga tewali ngeri yonna gye yali agenda mu maaso.
Now on to the approx.	Kati ku nga.
Happy to help.	Musanyufu okuyamba.
He didn’t know it would happen.	Yali tamanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
He is very afraid.	Atya nnyo.
He needed you.	Yali yeetaaga ggwe.
He felt comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi.
Or maybe even this .	Oba mpozzi ne kino .
Very good for them.	Kirungi nnyo gye bali.
Soon he will be here.	Mu bbanga ttono ajja kubeera wano.
This is almost true.	Kino kumpi kituufu.
I might be working at home myself.	Nze kennyini nnyinza okuba nga nkola awaka.
And you can’t, go alone again.	Era tosobola, kuddamu kugenda wekka.
For a while she felt comfortable with him.	Okumala akaseera yawulira bulungi naye.
I’ve always been prepared.	Bulijjo mbadde mwetegefu.
I hope this is okay with you.	Nsuubira nti kino kiri bulungi gyoli.
I have a car.	Nnina mmotoka.
You are a human being.	Oli muntu.
It was really difficult.	Ddala kyali kizibu.
My job is an artist.	Omulimu gwange gwa muyimbi.
It probably already has.	Oboolyawo kyalina dda.
Everyone wanted to talk to him.	Buli omu yali ayagala okwogera naye.
I will never talk to you again.	Sijja kuddamu kwogera naawe.
I, myself, will be in the hospital tomorrow.	Nze, nze kennyini, nja kubeera mu ddwaaliro enkya.
He would have to do this much sooner.	Kino yandibadde alina okukikola amangu ennyo.
I'm the one help!.	Nze oyo obuyambi!.
We’ll see if he actually works though.	Tujja kulaba oba ddala akola wadde.
No, not much.	Nedda, si nnyo.
He was so close now.	Yali kumpi nnyo kati.
And that’s what it is.	Era kye kiri.
He wants to do well in school.	Ayagala kukola bulungi mu ssomero.
Happy to be with you as well.	Musanyufu okubeera naawe naawe.
In this way please.	Mu ngeri eno nsaba.
Myself, but not myself.	Nze kennyini, naye si nze kennyini.
He didn’t know what he expected to find.	Yali tamanyi kye yali asuubira kufuna.
They were friendly.	Baali ba mukwano.
But there was no way.	Naye nga tewali ngeri yonna.
Same for anyone else here.	Kye kimu eri omuntu omulala yenna wano.
This was very common.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo nnyo.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
I have no idea about that.	Ekyo sirina kye mmanyi.
He is a little like that.	Ali bw’atyo katono.
He was doing it.	Yali akikola.
There is a moment.	Waliwo akaseera.
Not his friends, not even his girlfriend.	Si mikwano gye, wadde muganzi we.
But he was curious about things.	Naye yali ayagala okumanya ebintu.
To someone else.	Eri omuntu omulala.
I wasn’t sure that.	Nnali sikakasa nti.
Not happy, not very happy.	Si musanyufu, si musanyufu nnyo.
It was very beautiful.	Yali nnungi nnyo.
There is no reason not to.	Tewali nsonga lwaki tolina kukikola.
Everyone has been really friendly.	Buli muntu abadde wa mukwano ddala.
You work very, very hard.	Okola nnyo nnyo.
It was always going to be him.	Bulijjo kyali kigenda kubeera ye.
And they were.	Era baali.
Apparently in the same room, in the same place.	Kirabika mu kisenge kimu, mu kifo kye kimu.
But it was terrible.	Naye kyali kibi nnyo.
The answer is not uncommon.	Okuddamu si kya bulijjo.
I won’t be able to.	Sijja kusobola.
I couldn’t do that.	Ekyo nnali siyinza kukikola.
Herein lies the problem.	Wano we wali ekizibu.
How you always wanted to.	Engeri gye wali oyagala bulijjo.
I’m going to do it again.	Ngenda kuddamu okukikola.
He is younger than her.	Muto okusinga ye.
He had .	Yalina .
He doesn’t know, and he doesn’t know where it is.	Tamanyi, era tamanyi gye kiri.
He works with us.	Akola naffe.
He knew this was it.	Yali akimanyi nti kino kye kyali.
He was definitely asleep.	Mazima ddala yali yeebase.
Very nice guy.	Omulungi nnyo.
This is not true at all.	Kino si kituufu n’akatono.
And that’s certainly the case here.	Era ekyo mazima ddala ne wano bwe kiri.
This is an emergency situation.	Eno mbeera ya mangu.
He always knew, or knew, everyone.	Bulijjo yali amanyi, oba yali amanyi, buli muntu.
I knew nothing about the patient.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku mulwadde.
There is so much more to me than just that.	Waliwo bingi nnyo gyendi okusinga ekyo kyokka.
Whatever you want.	Kyonna ky’oyagala.
He looked like that .	Yalabika bwatyo .
He seems to be thinking all the time.	Alabika buli kiseera alowooza.
At school everything is fine, yes.	Ku ssomero buli kimu kiri bulungi, ye.
In this process.	Mu nkola eno.
That’s actually a pretty good point.	Ekyo mu butuufu nsonga nnungi nnyo.
It’s on now.	Kiri ku kati.
But that’s not the bad thing.	Naye ekyo si kye kibi.
And one of him.	Era omu ku ye.
Now, he had no choice but to speak.	Kati, yali talina kya kukola okuggyako okwogera.
You are not alone in this.	Si ggwe wekka mu kino.
It's here all week.	Kiri wano wiiki yonna.
He is not alone in his affairs.	Si ye yekka mu nsonga ze.
As you should have done.	Nga bwe wandibadde okola.
I thought he always would be.	Nalowooza nti bulijjo yandibadde bw’atyo.
And that’s not me.	Era oyo si nze.
He was a friend, in a way.	Yali mukwano, mu ngeri emu.
He seems like a really nice guy.	Alabika nga ggaayi omulungi ddala.
It’s happening so fast.	Kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
I need the money.	Nze nneetaaga ssente.
I wonder who else does.	Nze nneebuuza ani omulala akola.
It wasn’t what he wanted to see.	Si kye yali ayagala okulaba.
You will be at work.	Ojja kuba ku mulimu.
Something is not energy.	Ekintu si maanyi.
You don’t have a problem.	Tolina buzibu.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si ekyo kyokka.
This could be someone who will talk about preaching.	Kino kiyinza okuba omuntu ajja okwogera ku kubuulira.
I am not sure about this.	Ensonga eno sikakasa.
Every day, you know.	Buli lunaku, omanyi.
I think of that.	Nze ndowooza ekyo.
And it will surely happen.	Era mazima kijja kubaawo.
Clearly, there is a problem here.	Kya lwatu nti waliwo obuzibu wano.
But, there is no issue.	Naye, tewali nsonga yonna.
I go down for the weekend.	Ngenda wansi ku wiikendi.
Everything will be normal.	Buli kimu kijja kuba kya bulijjo.
I didn’t know it would be anything like this.	Nali simanyi nti kijja kuba kintu kyonna nga kino.
I don’t want to go back to work.	Saagala kudda ku mulimu.
Same with me exactly.	Kye kimu nange ddala.
Not at all.	Si bwe kiri n’akatono.
Now if not for us.	Kati oba si bwe kiri ku ffe.
And he was happy and very happy with himself.	Era yali musanyufu era nga musanyufu nnyo eri ye kennyini.
No, you can’t.	Nedda, tosobola.
He is in the air.	Ali mu bbanga.
This is happening very quickly.	Kino kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
It will be ineffective.	Kijja kuba tekijja kukola bulungi.
And that was true for a while.	Era ekyo kyali kituufu okumala akaseera.
I'm not now.	Siri kati.
I’m not sure it matters much.	Sikakasa nti kikulu nnyo.
It’s not too hard to do.	Si kizibu nnyo okukola.
This is a difficult thing.	Kino kintu kizibu.
But that wasn’t the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kyali.
You have to know.	Olina okumanya.
This was not what he was doing.	Kino si kye yali akola.
And a really good one at that.	Era ddala omulungi ku ekyo.
But he won’t eat.	Naye tajja kulya.
He is not in a relationship with me.	Tali mu mukwano nange.
He comes with us.	Ajja wamu naffe.
Now you know.	Kati omanyi.
He knew his job.	Yali amanyi omulimu gwe.
Or there is.	Oba waliwo.
And now you know who.	Era kati omanyi ani.
He really did .	Ddala yakola .
I will never be without this product!.	Sijja kuba nga sirina kintu kino!.
And there are so many more.	Era bingi nnyo.
Everything was good so far.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi okutuusa kati.
This is a very important thing.	Kino kintu kikulu nnyo.
This is not always true.	Kino si kituufu bulijjo.
It goes to .	Kigenda ku .
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
I want to believe.	Njagala kukkiriza.
That could be an issue.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ensonga.
How are you? 	Oli otya?
. . . .	.
That doesn’t seem to be the case here.	Ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri wano.
It was always you.	Bulijjo wali ggwe.
Maybe it’s just you.	Mpozzi nga ggwe wekka.
It’s still early.	Bukyali bukyali.
He was the strongest.	Ye yali asinga amaanyi.
And my father knew it.	Era taata yali akimanyi.
Of course, he knew he wasn't alone.	Kya lwatu nti yali akimanyi nti si ye yekka.
I actually hope not.	Mu butuufu nsuubira nti si bwe kiri.
He had no idea.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna.
But of these he knew not.	Naye ku bino yali tamanyi.
We can say this though.	Kino tusobola okwogera wadde.
I can’t get stronger.	Sisobola kufuna maanyi.
That, to me, is the crux of the matter.	Ekyo, gyendi, kye kikulu ennyo mu nsonga eno.
And you look good.	Era olabika bulungi.
On what? 	Ku ki?
He has no money, no car.	Talina ssente, talina mmotoka.
It’s not exactly true.	Si kituufu ddala.
His wife must be beautiful.	Mukyala we alina okuba omulungi.
He is the best.	Ye asinga.
He needs to think.	Yeetaaga okulowooza.
He just couldn’t.	Yali tasobola kyokka.
It had to be him.	Kyalina okuba nga ye.
It will last about an hour.	Kijja kumala essaawa nga emu.
He was very thoughtful.	Yali alowooza nnyo.
But that doesn’t matter right now.	Naye ekyo si kikulu mu kiseera kino.
That wasn’t his thing.	Ekyo si kye kyali ekintu kye.
He would have done just fine.	Yandibadde akola bulungi nnyo.
I have to do well.	Nnina okukola obulungi.
It is now less than a penny.	Kati eri wansi wa ssente emu.
We’re going to make this easy.	Kino tugenda kukikola kyangu.
And we will win.	Era tujja kuwangula.
But you might say no.	Naye oyinza okugamba nti nedda.
He didn’t know anyone who could.	Yali tamanyi muntu yenna asobola.
It’s really a lot of money.	Ddala ssente nnyingi nnyo.
It just won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo kyokka.
Everyone was expecting.	Buli omu yali asuubira.
But it was a really nice house.	Naye yali nnyumba nnungi ddala.
Not us, anyway.	Si ffe, mu ngeri yonna.
I wasn’t ready.	Nze nali siri mwetegefu.
One reason is too many.	Ensonga emu nnyingi.
This was going to be very easy.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kyangu nnyo.
I want it here now.	Njagala wano kati.
This was a good thing.	Kino kyali kirungi.
As we should.	Nga bwe tusaanidde.
To him, they already were.	Eri ye, baali dda.
And therein lies the problem for us.	Era awo we wali ekizibu gye tuli.
He could and probably should.	Yali asobola era oboolyawo yandibadde.
He loved his wife.	Yali ayagala nnyo mukyala we.
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
He says she is his friend.	Agamba nti ye mukwano gwe.
It was a wonderful atmosphere.	Yali mbeera nnungi nnyo.
Not like him at all.	Si nga ye n’akatono.
is very low.	eri wansi nnyo.
Then he thought he saw.	Awo n’alowooza nti yalaba.
He knew he would.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
He probably shouldn’t.	Oboolyawo tasaanidde kukikola.
It probably won’t, in fact, happen.	Oboolyawo tekijja kubaawo, mu butuufu, okubaawo.
But that’s not the issue here.	Naye eyo si nsonga wano.
You won’t, but you can.	Tojja kukikola, naye osobola.
But he really couldn’t do that.	Naye ddala ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
He shouldn’t have.	Talina kuba na.
He felt that way.	Yawulira bw’atyo.
He would do something about her.	Yandikoze ekintu ku ye.
I already knew that one.	Oyo nnali mmanyi dda.
This is normal.	Kino kya bulijjo.
Always yes, actually.	Bulijjo ye, mu butuufu.
He would be fine.	Yandibadde bulungi.
No really, he did.	Nedda ddala, bwe yakola.
This is where the problem lies.	Wano obuzibu we buli.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
The other was very young.	Omulala yali muto nnyo.
I think he’ll be fine.	Ndowooza ajja kuba bulungi.
We need a safe home.	Twetaaga awaka nga tolina bulabe.
I can’t find a place actually.	Sisobola kufuna kifo mu butuufu.
No one thought that could happen.	Tewali yali alowooza nti ekyo kiyinza okubaawo.
I was nowhere to be found.	Tewali we nnali nfunye.
I will be right next to you.	Nja kuba kumpi ddala naawe.
It’s right now.	Kituufu kati.
No one really knows.	Tewali amanyi ddala.
This goes on all night.	Kino kigenda mu maaso ekiro kyonna.
The book is simple and easy to read.	Ekitabo kino kyangu era kyangu okusoma.
Anything would be better than that.	Ekintu kyonna kyandibadde kirungi okusinga ekyo.
He immediately began to speak.	Yatandika mangu okwogera.
He may return soon.	Ayinza okudda amangu ddala.
He began to speak.	Yatandika okwogera.
I’m not sure what to say about that.	Sikakasa kya kwogera ku ekyo.
But they were.	Naye baali.
I could find a way.	Nnali nsobola okufuna engeri gye nnali nkola.
You have to work.	Olina okukola.
But maybe not, he thought.	Naye osanga si bwe kyali, bwe yalowooza.
But there was nothing.	Naye nga tewali kintu kyonna.
I was powerless.	Nnali sirina maanyi.
It is a very serious problem.	Kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I hope he knows that.	Nsuubira ekyo akimanyi.
But there is a problem.	Naye waliwo ekizibu.
I’m completely fine now.	Nze ndi bulungi ddala kati.
I am sick of all this.	Bino byonna ndi mulwadde.
This is my practice.	Kino kye nkola yange.
There is so much more.	Waliwo bingi nnyo.
That’s what he really wanted to do.	Ekyo yali ayagala nnyo okukola.
But he doesn’t go alone.	Naye tagenda yekka.
You know who it is.	Omanyi ani.
He was really good.	Ddala yali mulungi.
You can talk to him.	Oyinza okwogera naye.
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
Now, you have to go.	Kati, olina okugenda.
True, but that’s not all.	Kituufu, naye ekyo si kye kyokka.
Good, isn’t it ?.	Kirungi, si bwe kiri ?.
This is where everyone went.	Wano buli omu we yagenda.
He'll be back tomorrow.	Ajja kudda enkya.
It’s all about the man.	Byonna ku musajja.
I’m pretty sure they’re not.	Nkakasa bulungi nti si bwe bali.
It doesn’t matter what city.	Si kikulu kibuga ki.
Nobody needed this at the time.	Kino tewali yali yeetaaga mu kiseera ekyo.
And it will be wonderful.	Era kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
I am so beautiful.	Nze ndi mulungi nnyo.
We were going to do it.	Twali tugenda kukikola.
Maybe many hours a day.	Mpozzi essaawa nnyingi olunaku.
We cannot accept this view.	Tetusobola kukkiriza ndowooza eno.
The other was a friend.	Omulala yali mukwano gwe.
That may be true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
I only know one thing.	Nze mmanyi ekintu kimu kyokka.
He did a lot of things.	Yakola bingi.
He prefers it that way.	Asinga kwagala bw’atyo.
That was going to be difficult.	Ekyo kyali kigenda kuba kizibu.
We were all in the same room.	Ffenna twali mu kisenge kimu.
I really hope someone can help.	Nsuubira ddala waliwo asobola okuyamba.
And, in a sense, they were.	Era, mu ngeri emu, baali.
You’re home now baby.	Oli waka kati mwana.
He is obviously in trouble.	Kya lwatu nti ali mu buzibu.
Not in many cases.	Si bwe kiri mu mbeera nnyingi.
No, that’s the problem.	Nedda, ekyo kye kizibu.
It was actually quite good.	Mu butuufu kyali kirungi nnyo.
I’m not the only one saying this.	Si nze nzekka ayogera bino.
He would absolutely .	Yandibadde ddala .
I’m on the floor.	Nze ndi wansi.
I just can’t.	Nze sisobola kyokka.
This is what it was.	Kino kye kyali.
I have to go, brother.	Nnina okugenda, muganda wange.
He felt so suddenly .	Yawulira bwatyo mu bwangu .
We can’t stay here.	Tetusobola kusigala wano.
For the most part, I was good.	Okusinga nnali mulungi.
He was very busy.	Yali bbize nnyo.
You are either too good or too strong.	Oli mulungi nnyo oba oli wa maanyi nnyo.
Like they were in school.	Nga bwe baali mu ssomero.
I can't wait.	Siyinza kulinda.
It’s his room.	Kye kisenge kye.
You are a young man.	Oli musajja muto.
But he didn’t need love.	Naye yali teyeetaaga kwagala.
But he didn’t know that.	Naye ekyo yali tamanyi.
I need to talk to you.	Nnina okwogera naawe.
Exactly the same thing.	Ekintu kye kimu ddala.
He always does it.	Bulijjo akikola.
Not a very strong idea.	Si ndowooza ya maanyi nnyo.
He has his dad, that's it.	Alina taata we, ekyo kye kiri.
Perhaps he is.	Oboolyawo bw’atyo.
I already know.	Nze mmanyi dda.
But that wasn’t all he did.	Naye ekyo si kye kyokka kye yakola.
I knew he would come.	Nali mmanyi nti ajja kujja.
He is very afraid.	Atya nnyo.
You can back away from that.	Osobola okudda emabega okuva ku ekyo.
This was a good thing.	Kino kyali kirungi.
What a dangerous thing that is.	Ekyo nga kya bulabe nnyo.
I am very ordinary.	Ndi wa bulijjo nnyo.
You can’t do that.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola.
But that was that.	Naye ekyo kye kyali ekyo.
That’s a bad idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kibi.
The father is what he is.	Taata ye ky’ali.
He actually does quite well.	Mu butuufu akola bulungi nnyo.
The house is beautiful.	Ennyumba nnungi.
It will be in his room.	Kijja kuba mu kisenge kye.
That was all he could see.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali asobola okulaba.
It was very urban.	Yali ya kibuga nnyo.
No, it’s not there.	Nedda, si awo.
He is a clock doctor.	Ye musawo wa ssaawa.
I am not any kind of person at all.	Siri muntu wa ngeri yonna n’akatono.
He said that he was.	Yagamba nti yali.
That was always a problem.	Ekyo bulijjo kyali kizibu.
He had nothing and no one.	Yali talina kintu kyonna era nga talina muntu yenna.
Not so with him.	Si bwe kiri ku ye.
Everything seems normal.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
My house.	Ennyumba yange.
It was a good answer.	Kyali kya kuddamu bulungi.
We just have it.	Tulina kyokka.
This does not seem to be the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kiri.
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
It was a very important one.	Kyali kikulu nnyo.
I am sure you will do well!.	Nkakasa nti ojja kukola bulungi!.
Nothing seemed too important.	Tewali kyali kirabika nga kikulu nnyo.
Not anyone.	Si muntu yenna.
It’s really a conceptual problem.	Ddala kizibu kya ndowooza.
I wanted to spend time with him.	Nnali njagala okumala naye obudde.
He had no money.	Yali talina ssente.
However, he did.	Kyokka, yakikola.
However, only a short time.	Kyokka, akaseera katono ddala.
But he did it.	Naye yakikola.
I’m definitely not.	Nze mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
Of course, he does.	Kya lwatu nti akikola.
He might be here too.	Ayinza okuba wano naye.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I know I certainly do.	Nkimanyi nti mazima ddala nkola.
We are in luck.	Tuli mu mukisa.
You’re there for a reason.	Oli awo lwa nsonga.
It was worse than you thought.	Kyali kibi nnyo okusinga bwe wali olowooza.
But no, it’s true.	Naye nedda, kituufu.
But it’s not us.	Naye si ffe.
He said he didn't have to.	Yagambye nti talina kukikola.
That was probably it.	Ekyo oboolyawo kye kyali.
More than me.	Okusinga nze.
I think it will be good.	Ndowooza kijja kuba kirungi.
Not much of an issue now.	Si nsonga nnyingi kati.
He was powerless.	Yali talina maanyi.
But nothing is right.	Naye tewali kintu kituufu.
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
I’m going to say that.	Nze n’agamba nti.
But I’m not sure.	Naye sikakasa.
He did it better than anyone else.	Yakikola bulungi okusinga omuntu omulala yenna.
It is just that .	Kye kimu nti .
He could, but anyone could.	Yali asobola naye omuntu yenna yali asobola.
Whether you like it or not.	Oba oyagala oba toyagala.
But that’s just the thing.	Naye ekyo kye kintu kyokka.
Obviously, this is not true.	Kya lwatu nti kino si kituufu.
No one saw anything.	Tewali yalaba kintu kyonna.
I thought that was you.	Nalowooza nti oyo ggwe.
No reason, he just wanted to.	Tewali nsonga, yali ayagala kyokka.
Not everyone will do it.	Si buli muntu nti ajja kukikola.
I don’t care at all.	Sifaayo n’akatono.
I love that picture.	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi ekyo.
This is very important!.	Kino kikulu nnyo!.
I had no choice.	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kukola.
It was really true.	Ddala kyali kituufu.
Whatever he wanted.	Kyonna kye yali ayagala.
I’m afraid of being alone.	Ntya okubeera nzekka.
And he is here now.	Era ali wano kati.
And she was so beautiful.	Era nga mulungi nnyo.
Even if it was true.	Ne bwe kyali kituufu.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
No presence yet.	Tewali kubeerawo n'okutuusa kati.
And you .	Naawe .
Or not, whatever.	Oba nedda, kyonna.
My wife too.	Mukyala wange naye.
He needed that phone call.	Essimu eyo yali yeetaaga.
What a rush it was.	Nga kyali kya bwangu.
He was certainly lucky.	Mazima ddala yalina omukisa.
This is not what is happening.	Kino si kye kigenda mu maaso.
We were very close friends.	Twali ba mukwano nnyo.
Not the eyes.	Si maaso.
One cannot speak.	Omuntu tayinza kwogera.
I don't think so.	Nze ndowooza si bwe kiri.
I didn’t know anything.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi.
Whatever it is, it’s not good.	Kyonna kye kiri, si kirungi.
He had to get here.	Yalina okutuuka wano.
And that’s what he did.	Era ekyo kye yakola.
I don’t know much to say.	Simanyi bingi bye nnyinza kwogera.
And that’s where we can help.	Era awo we tusobola okuyamba.
No one could speak.	Tewali yali asobola kwogera.
No problem, he got that.	Tewali buzibu, yafuna ekyo.
It just looks good.	Kirabika bulungi kyokka.
It’s not just one thing .	Si kintu kimu kyokka .
This seems not to have been the case.	Kino kirabika si bwe kyali.
Although not very friendly.	Wadde nga si wa mukwano nnyo.
These are not the same thing.	Bino si kintu kye kimu.
No they were real.	Nedda baali ba ddala.
I do like my friend.	Nze nkola nga mukwano gwange.
He was like a father.	Yali nga taata.
We can beat anyone.	Tusobola okukuba omuntu yenna.
I know exactly where we are.	Nze mmanyi bulungi gye tuli.
But there is no luck.	Naye tewali mukisa.
And you can’t either.	Era naawe tosobola.
I will get to know.	Nja kufuna okumanya.
He has time to do it.	Alina obudde okukikola.
No one went.	Tewali yagenda.
He has no friends here.	Talina mikwano wano.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
He knew who he was.	Yali amanyi ky’ali.
But honestly, it’s not all your business.	Naye mu butuufu, si nsonga yo yonna.
But he was very happy with himself.	Naye yali musanyufu nnyo eri ye kennyini.
Indeed, I am very sorry.	Mazima ddala, nsonyiwa nnyo.
We are here, now.	Tuli wano, kati.
None of this is good.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kirungi.
You’ve been working hard for so long.	Obadde okola nnyo okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
As was everyone else.	Nga bwe kyali buli muntu.
Maybe it's me.	Mpozzi nze.
But that’s all.	Naye ebyo byonna.
In a sense, he did.	Mu ngeri emu, yakikola.
And you might be with us.	Era oyinza okuba nga naffe.
However, you are only one person.	Kyokka oli muntu omu yekka.
We can read.	Tusobola okusoma.
I will do this as myself.	Kino nja kukikola nga nze.
It was a wonderful atmosphere.	Yali mbeera nnungi nnyo.
He said he wouldn’t be there.	Yagamba nti tajja kubaawo.
And it still is.	Era n’okutuusa kati bwe kiri.
Whether it's true or not I don't know.	Kituufu oba nedda simanyi.
His brother was going with him of course.	Muganda we yali agenda naye ddala.
I think this is a really bad idea.	Ndowooza nti kino ddala kirowoozo kibi ddala.
Here, of course.	Wano, ddala.
You will go to the police.	Ojja kugenda ku poliisi.
I’m sure he’d be fine with that.	Nkakasa nti ekyo yandibadde bulungi.
Or indeed his way.	Oba ddala engeri gye.
That’s not my opinion, it’s a fact.	Eyo si ndowooza yange, nsonga.
The movie was pretty good though.	Firimu yali nnungi nnyo wadde.
That feels good to me.	Ekyo mpulira bulungi.
I couldn’t say what it was.	Nnali sisobola kwogera kye kyali.
He was planning to move on anyway.	Abadde ateekateeka okugenda mu maaso mu ngeri yonna.
He couldn’t eat anything.	Yali tasobola kulya kintu kyonna.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
But he didn’t want to be in this position.	Naye yali tayagala kubeera mu kifo kino.
However, that is not my point.	Kyokka eyo si y’ensonga yange.
Faster than all of us.	Asinga ffenna amangu.
Like that person.	Nga omuntu oyo.
And you must be .	Era olina okuba nga .
He was my son.	Yali mwana wange.
I wanted to work.	Nnali njagala kukola.
It must have been him.	Ateekwa okuba nga ye yali ye.
He would be here tomorrow.	Yandibadde wano enkya.
I had nowhere to go from there.	Nnali sirina we nnyinza kugenda okuva awo.
It is as important as it is difficult.	Kikulu nnyo nga bwe kiri ekizibu.
This is actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kino kyangu nnyo.
Apparently that is not the case.	Kirabika ekyo si bwe kiri.
Everyone is a brother.	Buli muntu wa muganda.
I am a problem for you.	Nze ndi kizibu gyoli.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
Maybe there’s something to that idea, maybe not.	Mpozzi waliwo ekintu ku ndowooza eyo, mpozzi nedda.
Together, we can do anything.	Nga tuli wamu, tusobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
He has been living in the now.	Abadde abeera mu kati.
Was everything going well? 	Buli kimu kyali kigenda bulungi?
Going to the hospital.	Okugenda mu ddwaaliro.
He thinks it would be great.	Alowooza nti kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
That is definitely not the case.	Ekyo mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
Or he did it.	Oba yakikola.
This is all together.	Kino ffenna tuli wamu.
She loved dogs.	Yali ayagala nnyo embwa.
I have so many things to do this evening.	Nnina ebintu bingi nnyo bye nnina okukola akawungeezi ka leero.
I like it soon.	Njagala nnyo amangu.
It was down there.	Kyali wansi awo.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
He had a good job.	Yalina omulimu omulungi.
It’s not a real movie.	Si firimu ya ddala.
He had a job to do.	Yalina omulimu gwe yakola.
This was the only thing he had now.	Kino kye kyali ekintu kyokka kye yalina kati.
But it’s happening all the time.	Naye kigenda mu maaso buli kiseera.
I really have to eat.	Nze ddala nnina okulya.
And that’s what he wanted.	Era ekyo kye yali ayagala.
We weren’t going anywhere.	Twali tetulina gye tugenda.
He had to say this thing.	Yalina okwogera ekintu kino.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
He was strong, fast, efficient in every way.	Yali wa maanyi, wa bwangu, ng’akola bulungi mu buli ngeri.
He was sound asleep.	Yali yeebase bulungi.
He should have done it earlier.	Yandibadde akikola nga bukyali.
Until he .	Okutuusa lwe .
That’s not entirely true.	Ekyo si kituufu ddala.
But always for the money.	Naye bulijjo lwa ssente.
. . . .	.
This was a real problem.	Kino kyali kizibu kya ddala.
It was there.	Kyali awo.
Obviously not as much.	Kya lwatu si nnyo nga bwe kiri.
I'll do it tonight.	Nja kukikola ekiro kino.
Probably not what you want.	Oboolyawo si ekyo ky’oyagala.
I should do this again very very soon.	Kino nsaanidde okuddamu okukikola mu bwangu ddala nnyo.
That’s nothing really.	Ekyo si kintu kyonna ddala.
No one wants to.	Tewali ayagala.
It was something to do.	Kyali kintu kya kukola.
Eating at you.	Okulya ku ggwe.
Perhaps, it’s too complicated.	Mpozzi, kizibu nnyo.
He is still very young.	Akyali muto nnyo.
There is no systemic risk.	Tewali bulabe bwa nkola.
I love being with you.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naawe.
Or so he felt.	Oba bwe yawulira.
There is always something going on.	Bulijjo waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
I'm the one who knows.	Nze omanyi.
Now he was.	Kati yali.
But probably not.	Naye oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
He seemed to be the only one.	Yalabika nga ye yekka.
He looked very, very happy.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo nnyo.
This is where he wanted it.	Wano we yali ayagala.
I’m sure it will be great.	Nkakasa nti kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
You know how they were.	Omanyi bwe baali.
Unable to come up with anything.	Nga tasobola kujja na kintu kyonna.
This thing here.	Kino ekintu wano.
But it’s not easy.	Naye si kyangu.
That’s not who we are.	Ekyo si kye tuli.
He had to go and he couldn’t go.	Yalina okugenda era nga tasobola kugenda.
I can't find a way to do it.	Sisobola kufuna ngeri gye nnyinza kukikola.
Not always true to the system.	Bulijjo si kituufu ku nkola.
It's in here.	Kiri mu wano.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
If only it would be here.	Singa kyandibadde wano.
He's not even good.	Tali wadde mulungi.
Then there was nothing, no one.	Awo nga tewali kintu kyonna, nga tewali muntu yenna.
I hope he does well.	Nsuubira nti akola bulungi.
We are all the same.	Ffenna tuli.
Driving his car.	Okuvuga mmotoka ye.
Will definitely buy again.	Mazima ddala ajja kuddamu okugula.
This is very, very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo nnyo.
I knew anyway.	Nali mmanyi mu ngeri yonna.
This is not the case at all.	Kino si bwe kiri n’akatono.
I am, now, like you.	Nze, kati, nga ggwe.
You can do it yourself.	Ggwe kennyini osobola okukikola.
My friend was nowhere to be seen.	Mukwano gwange yali talina we yali alabika.
You, not so much.	Ggwe, si nnyo.
He is such a good kid.	Ye mwana mulungi bwatyo.
This he was willing to do.	Kino yali mwetegefu okukola.
I was definitely home.	Mazima ddala nnali waka.
Everyone knows exactly who he is.	Buli omu amanyi ddala ky’ali.
Then when he did get .	Awo bwe yakola okufuna .
Easy for the teacher.	Kyangu ku musomesa.
That's my son, there.	Oyo mwana wange, awo.
He had been working toward something.	Yali abadde akola okutuuka ku kintu.
I wanted a child.	Nnali njagala mwana.
What a great feeling.	Nga mpulira nnyo.
He really couldn’t.	Mu mazima yali tasobola.
I'm not sure about him, already.	Sikakasa ku ye, dda.
He would and could do anything.	Yandikoze era yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
This was good for me.	Kino kyali kirungi gyendi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
And it’s difficult.	Era kizibu.
Nobody really knew that.	Ekyo mu butuufu tewali yali akimanyi.
Or so he hoped.	Oba bw’atyo bwe yali asuubira.
He could do this alone.	Kino yali asobola okukikola yekka.
I've made it this far with you.	Nze nfunye okutuuka wano naawe.
I didn’t know what to say.	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera.
It certainly looks very powerful.	Mazima ddala kirabika kya maanyi nnyo.
This might just work.	Kino kiyinza okukola kyokka.
He said he didn't.	Yagambye nti nedda.
I want to be alone.	Njagala kubeera nzekka.
But he couldn’t do that.	Naye ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
It will be much easier.	Kijja kuba kyangu nnyo.
Getting home.	Okutuuka awaka.
It’s hard to know what that is.	Kizibu okumanya ekyo kye ki.
He belongs here with me.	Ye wa wano nange.
And that, of course, is the point.	Era ekyo, kya lwatu, y’ensonga.
You'll be back here soon.	Ojja kudda wano mu bbanga ttono.
My father was.	Taata yali...
I am not a bus man.	Siri musajja wa bbaasi.
I want to know so much more.	Njagala okumanya bingi nnyo.
My father knows that very well.	Ekyo taata akimanyi nnyo.
I’m sure it was the same.	Nkakasa nti naye kyali kye kimu.
You are a man, but you are only one man.	Oli musajja naye oli musajja omu yekka.
Every kid has one now.	Buli mwana alina emu kati.
Perhaps it is true.	Oboolyawo kituufu.
And we will go again.	Era tujja kuddamu okugenda.
Everyone seems happy.	Buli omu alabika nga musanyufu.
And he usually wins.	Era atera okuwangula.
That had to be him.	Oyo yalina okuba nga ye.
Now, anyway.	Kati, mu ngeri yonna.
Just like anyone else.	Nga omuntu omulala yenna.
I have something to do with him.	Nnina kye nkola ku ye.
But they really aren’t.	Naye ddala si bwe bali.
But in any case.	Naye mu ngeri yonna.
Anyone would do the same thing.	Omuntu yenna yandikoze ekintu kye kimu.
Currently this is not the case.	Mu kiseera kino kino si bwe kiri.
He knew what he did.	Yali amanyi kye yakola.
He knows best.	Asinga okumanya.
But now, who knows.	Naye kati, ani amanyi.
He was nobody, really.	Yali si muntu yenna, ddala.
I work very very very hard.	Nkola nnyo nnyo nnyo.
He thinks we have to leave.	Alowooza nti tulina okuva awo.
This was .	Kino kyali .
And not just one on one.	Era si kimu kyokka ku kimu.
Not love, of course.	Si kwagala, ddala.
This seems serious.	Kino kirabika nga kya maanyi.
Everything is going to be fine.	Buli kimu kigenda kuba bulungi.
I’m afraid it isn’t.	Nze ntya si bwe kiri.
Of course, he would.	Kya lwatu nti yandikoze.
He said, it's good.	Yagamba nti, kirungi.
Actually, this is a very complicated process.	Mu butuufu, eno nkola ya buzibu nnyo.
But we need more money.	Naye twetaaga ssente nnyingi.
Now I have to go.	Kati nnina okugenda.
Easy access to everything.	Kyangu okutuuka ku buli kimu.
No one would do that.	Tewali yandikoze ekyo.
Good?.	Kirungi?.
Everyone wants it all.	Buli omu ayagala byonna.
It was actually much more powerful than that.	Mu butuufu kyali kya maanyi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
Now it’s time to drive one.	Kati kye kiseera okuvuga emu.
Everyone seemed to be doing the same.	Buli omu yalabika ng’akola kye kimu.
I didn’t know where.	Nnali simanyi wa.
It won’t be a problem for you.	Tekijja kuba kizibu gy’oli.
Whether he wanted to go or not.	Oba yali ayagala kugenda oba nedda.
And that’s a good thing.	Era ekyo kintu kirungi.
You said you would come back.	Wagamba nti ojja kudda.
Like, that's not even a thing here.	Nga, ekyo si wadde ekintu wano.
We will, of course.	Tujja, ddala.
I’m good and all.	Nze ndi mulungi era byonna.
But that was coming.	Naye ekyo kyali kigenda kujja.
He said she was his friend.	Yagambye nti yali mukwano gwe.
You know, if he did.	Omanyi singa yakikola.
It was like.	Yali nga...
He’s a really good friend of mine.	Ddala mukwano gwange mulungi.
He is still in his room.	Akyali mu kisenge kye.
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
I want to talk to him.	Njagala okwogera naye.
I need to get out of this place.	Nze nneetaaga okuva mu kifo kino.
No one really likes that place.	Tewali muntu yenna ayagala nnyo kifo ekyo.
But he had money, he had money.	Naye yalina ssente, yalina ssente.
What a serious problem.	Nga kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
And it was pretty cool.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo.
Home, too, well whenever we can.	Awaka, era, bulungi buli lwe tusobola.
This is not true at all.	Kino si kituufu n’akatono.
She would have preferred to be alone with him.	Yandibadde asinga kwagala kubeera naye yekka.
Me with no one behind me.	Nze nga tewali muntu yenna emabega wange.
He is here in the house right now.	Ali wano mu nnyumba mu kiseera kino.
All week with nothing to do.	Wiiki yonna nga tewali kya kukola.
I don’t have the money.	Nze sirina ssente.
I want that one.	Njagala eyo.
No, it’s not the same.	Nedda, si kye kimu.
Now you can do whatever you want here.	Kati osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala wano.
We cannot allow this to happen.	Tetusobola kukkiriza kino kubaawo.
That’s not an answer.	Ekyo si kya kuddamu.
No one knows what they are.	Tewali amanyi kye bali.
As it was the case.	Nga bwe kyali.
This was very, very simple.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo nnyo.
Or they were now.	Oba baali kati.
My father was like that.	Taata yali bw’atyo.
Not in any way, shape, or form.	Si mu ngeri yonna, mu ngeri yonna, oba mu ngeri yonna.
I really don’t know how to go about this.	Mu butuufu simanyi ngeri ya kugenda mu kino.
He would rather be a young guy.	Yandibadde asinga kuba ggaayi muto.
In one hour.	Mu ssaawa emu.
Money is money.	Ssente ssente.
I'll be together soon.	Nja kuba wamu mu bbanga ttono.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
Not like today.	Si nga leero.
That is a terrible thing.	Ekyo kintu kibi nnyo.
That’s a common practice.	Eyo nkola ya bulijjo.
The food is excellent.	Emmere nnungi nnyo.
That was a powerful moment.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
I wanted to say she was beautiful.	Nnali njagala okugamba nti yali mulungi.
He looked unhappy.	Yalabika nga si musanyufu.
I can maybe get behind this.	Nsobola mpozzi okufuna emabega wa kino.
No one person does.	Tewali muntu omu akola.
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nkola.
He was talking to me.	Yali ayogera nange.
Urban.	Mu kibuga.
I need so much more.	Nze nneetaaga bingi nnyo.
But he was terrified.	Naye yali atya nnyo.
He would be unemployed.	Yandibadde talina mulimu.
But it won’t be the same.	Naye tekijja kuba kye kimu.
Everyone is strong.	Buli omu alina amaanyi.
You will get a job.	Ojja kufuna omulimu.
And this is not the same.	Era kino si kye kimu.
But we’ll be fine.	Naye tujja kuba bulungi.
Like, nothing really.	Nga, tewali kintu kyonna ddala.
But he has no idea.	Naye talina kirowoozo kyonna.
For me it won’t work.	Nze tekijja kukola.
You are not a person.	Ggwe toli muntu.
But there was nothing he could do about that now.	Naye nga tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku ekyo kati.
There is certainly a reason for that.	Mazima ddala waliwo ensonga lwaki ekyo.
I feel like I love it.	Mpulira nga njagala nnyo.
That he would be good.	Nti yandibadde mulungi.
I am a practical man.	Ndi musajja wa nkola.
He is a good-looking person.	Ye muntu alabika obulungi.
It can happen right now.	Kiyinza okubaawo mu kiseera kino.
. . . .	.
Me too .	Nange .
He couldn’t go home.	Yali tasobola kudda waka.
It doesn’t come across as good.	Tekijja nga kirungi.
It’s a dangerous place to be.	Kifo kya bulabe okubeera.
He does that.	Akola bw’atyo.
He speaks the truth.	Ayogera mazima.
I'll be back tomorrow.	Nja kudda enkya.
I can help.	Nsobola okuyamba.
It’s not a matter of love.	Si nsonga ya kwagala.
It doesn’t matter what.	Si kikulu ki.
Do you think	Olowooza .
We’ll stay safe because he won’t know.	Tujja kusigala bulungi kuba tajja kumanya.
I thought everyone knew it.	Nalowooza nti buli omu akimanyi.
He was working now.	Yali akola kati.
And he was beautiful.	Era nga mulungi.
You can’t do it.	Tosobola kukikola.
I think he knows better now.	Ndowooza kati asinga okumanya.
You will have to drive.	Ojja kuba olina okuvuga.
But he does do so.	Naye akola bw’atyo.
The picture was awful.	Ekifaananyi kyali kibi nnyo.
Nothing goes away.	Tewali kintu kyonna kigenda.
The book looked real.	Ekitabo ekyo kyali kirabika nga kya ddala.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
Indeed, it will be wonderful.	Mazima ddala, kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
But there is no time for this.	Naye kino tewali budde.
We shall see how it is.	Tujja kulaba nga bwe kiri.
And so do you.	Era naawe.
It’s hard to read.	Kizibu okusoma.
It’s definitely good for you.	Mazima ddala kirungi gy’oli.
I have nothing to do with knowledge.	Sirina kye nkola ku kumanya.
And he too, at the time.	Era ye naye, mu kiseera ekyo.
It was a common thing there.	Yali kintu kya bulijjo eyo.
I can't find a good way to do this though.	Sisobola kufuna ngeri nnungi ya kukola kino wadde.
They were the same thing.	Baali kintu kye kimu.
I’m in a position.	Nze ndi mu mbeera.
It would be easier for everyone.	Kyandibadde kyangu eri buli muntu.
I can’t talk about anything.	Siyinza kwogera ku kintu kyonna.
He certainly does that.	Mazima ddala ekyo akikola.
It was almost as he expected.	Kumpi kyali nga bwe yali asuubira.
It’s very hard to do.	Kizibu nnyo okukola.
Although I was working.	Wadde nga nnali nkola.
You know? 	Omanyi?
Right now he was busy.	Kati kati yali bbize.
He must have been good.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali mulungi.
I think of both of us.	Nze ndowooza ku ffembi.
At this time he was still very young and vulnerable.	Mu kiseera kino yali akyali muto nnyo era nga alina ekizibu.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
I want to go home, she thought.	Njagala kudda waka, bwe yalowooza.
Nothing good at all.	Tewali kirungi n’akatono.
This would be true if .	Kino kyandibadde kituufu singa .
Everyone does it.	Buli muntu akikola.
That won’t happen for long though.	Ekyo tekijja kubaawo okumala ebbanga ddene wadde.
No, that’s not quite right.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
You will know everything.	Ojja kumanya buli kimu.
As if it was real.	Nga bwe kiri nti kyali kya ddala.
He seems like a nice guy.	Alabika nga ggaayi omulungi.
He's that guy now.	Ye ggaayi oyo kati.
I’m a man.	Nze ndi musajja.
And all this at the same time.	Era bino byonna mu kiseera kye kimu.
To do anything.	Okukola ekintu kyonna.
He would love it.	Yandiyagadde nnyo.
Nothing seems too important.	Tewali kirabika kikulu nnyo.
The only thing.	Ekintu kyokka.
It’s very simple.	Kye kyangu nnyo.
I think everyone is here.	Ndowooza buli omu ali wano.
It’s not the weather.	Si mbeera ya budde.
As fast as that.	Nga bwangu nga ekyo.
Or you already have one.	Oba olina dda emu.
I really couldn’t help anyone.	Mu butuufu nnali sisobola kuyamba muntu yenna.
He had this issue.	Yali alina ensonga eno.
Obviously not me.	Kya lwatu nti si nze.
For me, that’s a good thing.	Nze ekyo kirungi.
Yeah, yeah.	Ye ye.
That was it for me at the time.	Ekyo kye kyali gyendi mu kiseera ekyo.
Not almost nothing, not almost nothing.	Si kumpi tewali, si kumpi tewali.
You are just a human being.	Oli muntu yekka.
And who knows exactly what they were.	Era ani amanyi ddala kye baali.
I'll help.	Nja kuyamba.
Will definitely buy again.	Mazima ddala ajja kuddamu okugula.
He had no time now.	Yali talina budde kati.
But we’ll see what happens.	Naye tujja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
He was such a nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo bw’atyo.
I'm not sure what to make of that.	Sikakasa kya kukola ku ekyo.
You'll come.	Ojja kujja.
This is an opportunity.	Guno mukisa.
Not just anyone can make this film.	Si muntu yenna yekka asobola okukola firimu eno.
You are right on time.	Oli mu budde ddala.
Not even to himself.	Si wadde eri ye kennyini.
It looks good to me.	Kirabika bulungi gyendi.
You do anything.	Ggwe okola ekintu kyonna.
He was in class to himself.	Yali mu kibiina eri ye kennyini.
We were all friends.	Ffenna twali ba mukwano.
I can’t wait to go.	Siyinza kulinda kugenda.
He spoke to her.	Yayogera naye.
I was very young and it was very, very hard.	Nali muto nnyo era nga kizibu nnyo nnyo.
This is a really difficult time.	Kino kye kiseera ekizibu ddala.
I will do that.	Ekyo nja kukikola.
Not until tomorrow.	Si okutuusa enkya.
I don’t quite know why.	Simanyi bulungi lwaki.
The dog was fine though.	Embwa yali bulungi wadde.
I want everything in mine.	Njagala buli kimu mu kyange.
That’s what everyone said you should do.	Ekyo buli omu kye yagamba nti olina okukola.
You know very well that is not the case.	Omanyi bulungi ekyo si bwe kiri.
Everything was happening almost all the time.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda mu maaso kumpi buli kiseera.
He must and wants to.	Ateekwa era ayagala.
It was always the case.	Bulijjo bwe kyali.
Nothing from me.	Tewali kintu kyonna okuva gyendi.
He was always saying no.	Bulijjo yali agamba nti nedda.
It’s not about staying the same.	Si kya kusigala nga kye kimu.
And yet it is.	Era naye bwe kiri.
It’s not too bad.	Si kibi nnyo.
I thought you were a nice person.	Nalowooza nti oli muntu mulungi.
It was definitely there.	Mazima ddala kyali awo.
Like maybe working in a hospital.	Nga mpozzi okukola mu ddwaaliro.
He could eat anything.	Yali asobola okulya ekintu kyonna.
We’re here instead, and no one knows it.	Tuli wano mu kifo, era tewali akimanyi.
I feel really good actually.	Mpulira bulungi ddala mu butuufu.
Certainly not.	Mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
He must be prepared for this.	Kino alina okuba nga mwetegefu.
The dinner was wonderful.	Ekyeggulo kyali kirungi nnyo.
That’s either today or tomorrow.	Ekyo oba leero oba enkya.
He seems to think a lot.	Alabika alowooza nnyo.
But this is not so easy.	Naye kino si kyangu nnyo.
This is actually not true.	Kino mu butuufu si kituufu.
I don’t want to be with you anymore.	Saagala kuddamu kubeera naawe.
I can do all of those things.	Ebintu ebyo byonna nsobola okukola.
Maybe too many things.	Mpozzi ebintu bingi nnyo.
That’s not realistic.	Ekyo si kya ddala.
Not quickly, by any means.	Si mangu, mu ngeri yonna.
There is no problem here.	Wano tewali buzibu.
He should have acted quickly.	Yandibadde akola mu bwangu.
You’re in luck.	Oli mu mukisa.
That won’t be easy.	Ekyo tekijja kuba kyangu.
It may be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
I might get lucky with you.	Nnyinza okufuna omukisa gy’oli.
You know you’re not the only one at risk.	Omanyi si ggwe wekka ali mu bulabe.
And you can move on.	Era oyinza okugenda mu maaso.
I’m not from here.	Nze siri wa wano.
That’s where it is.	Eyo gye kiri.
Whatever you would like.	Kyonna kye wandyagadde.
I wanted to work with him.	Nnali njagala okukola naye.
It will be with you soon.	Kijja kuba naawe mu bbanga ttono.
But that’s not the problem.	Naye ekyo si kye kizibu.
You really and truly don’t have to.	Ddala era mu butuufu tolina kukikola.
I didn’t have anyone.	Nnali sirina muntu yenna.
Maybe it will work.	Mpozzi kijja kukola.
He already had my dinner.	Yalina dda ekyeggulo kyange.
You don’t want it too much.	Toyagala nnyo.
But you don’t have to be too friendly.	Naye tolina kuba wa mukwano nnyo.
In fact, he is not.	Mu butuufu si bw’atyo.
I always know exactly when too.	Bulijjo nange mmanyi bulungi ddi.
And it was good.	Era kyali kirungi.
I wonder that myself.	Ekyo nze kennyini nneebuuza.
And you know it’s true.	Era omanyi nti kituufu.
More than anyone else.	Okusinga omuntu omulala yenna.
I don’t even want to know.	Saagala na kumanya.
Of course, you can’t love everyone.	Kya lwatu nti tosobola kwagala buli muntu.
I don’t know what to say.	Simanyi kya kwogera.
Not a little bit.	Si katono ddala.
It’s very difficult for me right now.	Kizibu nnyo gyendi mu kiseera kino.
Maybe it always was.	Mpozzi bulijjo bwe kyali.
That’s what’s important.	Ekyo kye kikulu.
Which he wanted to do.	Kye yali ayagala okukola.
Probably not, but it is an idea.	Oboolyawo si bwe kiri naye kirowoozo.
It’s just the same with you.	Kye kimu kyokka naawe.
I'll ride with you.	Nja kuvuga naawe.
I am nothing like that.	Nze siri kintu nga ekyo.
Much the same with us.	Kye kimu nnyo ne ffe.
You don’t know what that is.	Ekyo tomanyi bwe kiri.
This is what we are.	Kino kye tuli.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
I knew we would.	Nnali nkimanyi nti tujja kukikola.
His wife is in class this weekend.	Mukyala we ali mu kibiina wiikendi eno.
This was a real homecoming.	Kino kyali kya kudda waka ddala.
Everything is not good.	Buli kimu si kirungi.
No one has something like that.	Tewali alina kintu nga ekyo.
He certainly can.	Mazima ddala asobola.
And it was much worse than that.	Era kyali kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I just loved working with him.	Nze nnali njagala nnyo okukola naye.
I'm here, that's why.	Nze ndi wano, y'ensonga.
This concept would do all of those things.	Endowooza eno yandikoze ebintu ebyo byonna.
No one does it better than me.	Tewali akikola okusinga nze.
I'll be back in that hour.	Nja kudda mu ssaawa eyo.
And so was my father.	Era ne taata bwe yali.
But that’s not to be.	Naye ekyo si kya kubeera.
That’s not quite true.	Ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
From this.	Okuva mu kino.
This isn’t a bad thing.	Kino si kibi.
And you can help.	Era osobola okuyamba.
This is certainly the case here.	Kino mazima ddala bwe kiri wano.
I think we have to do this.	Ndowooza kino tulina okukikola.
His job is to.	Omulimu gwe.
I feel better.	Mpulira bulungi.
From here it seems all you have.	Okuva wano kirabika byonna olina.
He was not ordinary.	Yali si wa bulijjo.
It’s really really great.	Ddala ddala kirungi nnyo.
You already know that.	Ekyo okimanyi dda.
I’m in that position right now.	Nze ndi mu kifo ekyo mu kiseera kino.
Here, it’s true.	Wano, kituufu.
No luck so far.	Tewali mukisa okutuusa kati.
And that’s what it is.	Era ekyo kye kiri.
He is certainly not happy.	Mazima ddala si musanyufu.
We can’t do it without you.	Tetusobola kukikola nga tolina ggwe.
Not just for you but him, too.	Si ku ggwe wekka naye naye, naye.
I certainly was.	Mazima ddala nnali.
However, everyone is normal.	Kyokka buli omu abeera wa bulijjo.
All of this was us.	Bino byonna twali ffe.
He has a reason.	Alina ensonga.
Not a lot of money.	Si ssente nnyingi.
He can’t tell if he’s asleep or not.	Tasobola kumanya oba yeebase oba nedda.
I hope you know better.	Nsuubira nti ggwe asinga okumanya.
That will happen next week.	Ekyo kijja kubaawo wiiki ejja.
It was a mess.	Kyali kya buzibu.
And it’s so beautiful.	Era nga kirungi nnyo.
Nothing unusual about that.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo ku ekyo.
We are all in trouble.	Ffenna tuli mu buzibu.
This is the relationship.	Guno gwe mukwano.
You don’t have to do this.	Kino tolina kukikola.
But, maybe not always.	Naye, mpozzi si bulijjo.
He didn't know how to do that.	Ekyo yali tamanyi ngeri ya kukikola.
I am in the .	Nze ndi mu .
He doesn’t have a car.	Talina mmotoka.
Everything was easy.	Buli kimu kyali kyangu.
But he couldn’t always do it.	Naye bulijjo yali tasobola kukikola.
He was going a little further.	Yali agenda mu maaso katono.
It was very, very real.	Kyali kya ddala nnyo, kya ddala nnyo.
But it’s also a blessing.	Naye era gwe mukisa.
But he will be curious.	Naye ajja kuba ayagala okumanya.
At the moment it is not true.	Mu kiseera kino si kituufu.
He had it going on.	Yalina nga kigenda mu maaso.
But he's really really.	Naye ye ddala ddala.
I'm going with you.	Ngenda naawe.
My father and I.	Taata nange.
However, this is a really good movie.	Kyokka eno firimu nnungi ddala.
This is fine for now.	Kino kirungi mu kiseera kino.
I’m too young.	Nze ndi muto nnyo.
He had been a child.	Yali abadde mwana muto.
This is what we are now.	Kino kye tuli kati.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
That’s great for them.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo gye bali.
He is a lucky child.	Ye mwana wa mukisa.
. . . .	.
Even earlier, or.	Wadde emabegako, oba.
This is a dangerous idea.	Eno ndowooza ya bulabe.
You have .	Olina .
He says he is fine and ready to go.	Agamba nti ali bulungi era mwetegefu okugenda.
How could he be.	Yandibadde atya.
Very simple, very true.	Kyangu nnyo, kituufu nnyo.
We need a reason.	Twetaaga ensonga.
He said he wanted to talk to me about something.	Yagamba nti ayagala kwogera nange ku kintu.
She is his wife.	Ye mukyala we.
The plan began to work.	Enteekateeka yatandika okukola.
. . . .	.
Same with mine.	Kye kimu ne ku kyange.
I know it is very true and very true.	Nkimanyi nti kituufu nnyo era kituufu nnyo.
I work very, very hard myself.	Nze kennyini nkola nnyo nnyo.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
This was not true.	Kino kyali si kituufu.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ye mukyala mulungi.
You want a friend.	Oyagala mukwano.
We’re here, baby.	Ffe wano mwana.
Probably no one does.	Oboolyawo tewali akikola.
It will go to someone else.	Kijja kugenda eri omuntu omulala.
You can’t have him.	Tosobola kuba na ye.
I’m sure we can do better.	Nkakasa nti tusobola okukola obulungi.
Exactly what is that .	Ddala ekyo kye ki .
That’s how he would do it.	Bw’atyo bwe yandikoze.
One always wants to get to the truth.	Omuntu bulijjo ayagala okutuuka ku mazima.
You don’t have to do this.	Kino tolina kukikola.
You can read it.	Osobola okusoma.
I am absolutely.	Nze ndi ddala.
This alone will help a lot.	Kino kyokka kijja kuyamba nnyo.
This would be normal.	Kino kyandibadde kya bulijjo.
Perhaps he spoke.	Oboolyawo yayogera.
You should be happy right now.	Olina okuba nga oli musanyufu mu kiseera kino.
I’m absolutely fine.	Nze ndi bulungi ddala.
It is nowhere to be found.	Tewali we kiri.
Anyone can see that this is a quick process.	Omuntu yenna asobola okulaba nti eno nkola ya mangu.
I don’t care about myself.	Sifaayo ku nze.
You want to know why.	Oyagala okumanya lwaki.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
He went with her.	Yagenda naye.
He wants to be here.	Ayagala kubeera wano.
But you were there.	Naye ggwe wali awo.
Where is this going.	Kino kigenda wa.
But this is not the reality.	Naye kino si kye kituufu.
He really did it.	Ddala yakikola.
Not too much of it.	Si bingi nnyo.
That was very important to me.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo gyendi.
It’s not always easy, of course.	Si kyangu bulijjo, ddala.
But he didn't want to talk to me.	Kyokka yali tayagala kwogera nange.
He doesn’t think so.	Talowooza bw’atyo.
Not with him, of course.	Si naye, ddala.
Why are they like that.	Lwaki bwe bali.
There is an opportunity.	Waliwo omukisa.
He is absolutely fine.	Ali bulungi ddala.
I know that really well.	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi ddala.
Not at all.	Si wadde.
The reason why everything is.	Ensonga lwaki buli kimu kiri.
I was fine.	Nnali bulungi.
That was always true.	Ekyo kyali kituufu bulijjo.
I don’t think that’s a bad thing.	Ekyo sirowooza nti kintu kibi.
I have a relationship problem.	Nnina obuzibu mu mukwano.
But he wasn’t a kid.	Naye yali si mwana muto.
Today is the day.	Leero lwe lunaku.
He shouldn't have been able to do that.	Ekyo yali tasaanidde kusobola kukikola.
I wanted my dog.	Nnali njagala embwa yange.
He will have .	Ajja kuba ne .
Even on the weekends.	Ne ku wiikendi.
Everyone told me it would be hard.	Buli omu yang’amba nti kijja kuba kizibu.
It was a blessing for us too.	Naffe kyali kya mukisa gye tuli.
But there is no way.	Naye tewali ngeri yonna.
He knew who it must be.	Yali amanyi ani ateekwa okuba.
But, most of all, of course.	Naye, okusinga byonna, ddala.
What are you doing.	Okola ki.
And it’s good.	Era kirungi.
Or he will go and he won’t.	Oba ajja kugenda era tajja kugenda.
You can do almost anything.	Kumpi osobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
I was afraid of this.	Kino nnali ntya.
And you are now.	Era naawe kati oli.
I will be working from home.	Nja kuba nkola nga ndi waka.
I hope you are ready for that.	Nsuubira nti ekyo oli mwetegefu.
He is a very nice man.	Musajja mulungi nnyo.
Not too much of it.	Si bingi nnyo.
But that’s not what we have here.	Naye ekyo si kye tulina wano.
Everything was great.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi nnyo.
Or someone else has.	Oba omuntu omulala alina.
This was not the movie.	Eno si ye yali firimu.
He knew he was strong.	Yali akimanyi nti wa maanyi.
I can be good at this.	Nsobola okubeera omulungi mu kino.
He said he needed help.	Yagambye nti yeetaaga obuyambi.
I’m afraid to think.	Ntya okulowooza.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
He needs someone to work with, he said.	Yeetaaga omuntu akola naye, bwe yagambye.
You have a reason.	Olina ensonga.
He was very happy about that.	Ekyo yali musanyufu nnyo.
Will be back soon.	Ajja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
However, I have to go soon.	Kyokka nnina okugenda amangu.
I think that’s all.	Ndowooza ekyo kyokka.
Knowledge is a powerful thing.	Okumanya kintu kya maanyi nnyo.
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
This is what it was.	Kino kye kyali.
He was a wonderful child.	Yali mwana mulungi nnyo.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
Both were normal.	Bombi baali ba bulijjo.
He knew better, of course.	Yali amanyi bulungi, ddala.
Whoever he was.	Oyo yenna gwe yali.
I don’t think that would be good.	Sirowooza nti ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
The house is empty.	Ennyumba tewali muntu yenna.
Although it would be really nice if we could.	Wadde nga ddala kyandibadde kirungi singa tusobola.
But he’s not just a good singer.	Naye si muyimbi mulungi yekka.
No.	Nedda.
He was mine, mine, of course.	Yali wange, wange, ddala.
She was so beautiful, so strong.	Yali mulungi nnyo, nga wa maanyi nnyo.
You are here now.	Oli wano kati.
I don’t care.	Nze sifaayo.
But they really aren’t.	Naye ddala si bwe bali.
It was great then and now.	Kyali kirungi nnyo mu kiseera ekyo ne kati.
Are you sure?.	Okakasa?.
You just know.	Ggwe omanyi kyokka.
It seems like that would be the case.	Kirabika ng’ekyo bwe kyandibadde.
Or appeared to.	Oba yalabika eri.
He won’t be young.	Tajja kuba muto.
But he knew.	Naye yali amanyi.
Might have to do it now.	Ayinza okuba nga alina okukikola kati.
But it won’t go away.	Naye tekijja kugenda.
He wasn’t happy.	Yali si musanyufu.
One could not say anything.	Omuntu yali tasobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
Clearly, he did not like the man.	Kya lwatu nti yali tayagala musajja oyo.
That is the hard truth below.	Ekyo kye kituufu ekizibu wansi.
You will see a lot.	Ojja kulaba bingi.
He must have been very lonely.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali yekka nnyo.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
It’s not even true.	Si bwe kiri wadde nga kituufu.
I was very, very busy.	Nali bbize nnyo nnyo.
I don’t have the space to talk about these here.	Sirina kifo kya kwogera ku bino wano.
But there they were.	Naye awo we baali.
Actually it really isn’t.	Mu butuufu ddala si bwe kiri.
But now he is happy.	Kyokka kati musanyufu.
That’s what I expected.	Ekyo nnali nsuubira.
He was asleep.	Yali yeebase.
But I’m the only one.	Naye nze nzekka.
They are currently.	Mu kiseera kino bali...
I really have no idea why.	Mu butuufu sirina kye mmanyi lwaki.
We have to go.	Tulina okugenda.
Too bad, anyway.	Kibi nnyo, mu ngeri yonna.
We’ll just stay in the back of the bus.	Tujja kumala kusigala emabega wa bbaasi.
What? 	Kiki?
He won't say what that was.	Tajja kwogera ekyo kye kyali.
I don’t really know how to answer that.	Ekyo simanyi bulungi ngeri gye nnyinza kuddamu.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
No issues at this point.	Tewali nsonga mu kiseera kino.
They are really really good friends.	Ddala ddala ba mukwano nnyo.
This is very important in practice.	Kino kikulu nnyo mu nkola.
I don’t think he should.	Sirowooza nti yandibadde.
At this point, how do you want to say.	Mu kiseera kino, oyagala okwogera otya.
I am in your house.	Nze ndi mu nnyumba yo.
No, he had no choice.	Nedda, yali talina kya kukola.
It is certainly wrong.	Mazima ddala kibi.
I want a plan.	Njagala enteekateeka.
You are almost as strong as he is.	Oli kumpi wa maanyi nga ye.
It was a very important thing.	Kyali kintu kikulu nnyo.
He does important.	Akola kikulu.
He acts like a guy and all.	Akola nga ggaayi ne byonna.
He was my brother.	Yali muganda wange.
However, it is not who as much as what.	Kyokka, si ani nga bwe kiri nti kiki.
The issue is here and here .	Ensonga eri wano ne wano .
But it’s going to be more complicated than that.	Naye kigenda kuba kizibu okusinga ekyo.
That is in this case.	Ekyo kiri mu mbeera eno.
That was easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu.
It’s the same with everyone.	Kye kimu ne buli omu.
But there is a problem.	Naye waliwo obuzibu.
Always on, always hopeful, always hopeful.	Bulijjo abeera ku, bulijjo alina essuubi, bulijjo alina essuubi.
I have no idea where it is.	Sirina kirowoozo ku kifo we kiri.
Everything is excellent and on time.	Buli kimu kirungi nnyo era nga kigenda ku ssaawa.
This is not easy to know.	Kino si kyangu kumanya.
We are a community of faith .	Tuli kibiina kya kukkiriza .
But there is no problem.	Naye tewali buzibu.
He needed help and he knew it.	Yali yeetaaga obuyambi era yali akimanyi.
I wanted to be alone to think.	Nnali njagala kubeera nzekka okulowooza.
In many cases this will be true.	Mu mbeera nnyingi kino kijja kuba kituufu.
It is mostly very simple.	Okusinga kyangu nnyo.
I may call anytime.	Nnyinza okukuba essimu essaawa yonna.
That's all he is.	Oyo yekka ky'ali.
The problem is! 	Obuzibu!
Not for long.	Si okumala ebbanga ddene.
Everyone had their own job.	Buli omu yalina omulimu gwe.
You are one person.	Ggwe oli muntu omu.
And we were close .	Era nga tuli kumpi .
Really good with everyone here.	Ddala mulungi ne buli muntu wano.
He actually did it.	Mu butuufu yakikola.
He can’t win on the issue.	Tasobola kuwangula ku nsonga.
Both are his.	Bombi bali ye.
He was doing that on the side as well.	Ekyo yali akikola ne ku ludda.
He didn’t have time for this.	Kino yali talina budde.
He was young, still young.	Yali muto, nga akyali muto.
That won’t work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola.
It was a good feeling.	Yali mpulira nnungi.
But, you know how it is.	Naye, omanyi bwe kiri.
He has a reason.	Alina ensonga.
Probably, he thought.	Oboolyawo, bwe yalowooza.
I am very good at making money.	Ndi mulungi nnyo mu kukola ssente.
I won’t mind a bit.	Sijja kuba na buzibu katono.
We don’t have a very good relationship.	Tetulina mukwano mulungi nnyo.
I love watching movies.	Njagala nnyo okulaba firimu.
I loved that one.	Nnali njagala nnyo eyo.
I thought of you.	Nalowooza ku ggwe.
You can just say that.	Oyinza okumala okwogera ekyo.
For myself and for him.	Ku nze kennyini ne ku ye.
But he had no choice in the matter.	Naye yali talina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo.
There is no such issue.	Tewali nsonga eyo.
He’s not going to come forward.	Tagenda kujja mu maaso.
Obviously, this was a good thing.	Kya lwatu nti kino kyali kintu kirungi.
He felt very happy.	Yawulira nga musanyufu nnyo.
Nothing bad is going to happen today.	Tewali kibi kigenda kubaawo leero.
It wasn’t his car.	Si yali mmotoka ye.
I don’t know, not being one.	Simanyi, si kubeera omu.
That was the thing.	Ekyo kye kyali ekintu.
But that was very, very powerful.	Naye ekyo kyali kya maanyi nnyo nnyo.
Everything looks good.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi.
From here I can get what I expected.	Okuva wano nsobola okufuna kye nnali nsuubira.
Back to the person he was before .	Okudda ku muntu gwe yali emabegako .
It’s a lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi nnyo.
Maybe he isn’t.	Mpozzi nga si bw’atyo.
I thought he did that really well.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo yakikola bulungi ddala.
It doesn’t matter what he told me.	Si kikulu kye yang’amba.
That was the plan.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka.
He will certainly do it.	Mazima ddala ajja kukikola.
You can .	Osobola .
Like a friend of mine.	Nga mukwano gwange.
But in the meantime we .	Naye mu kiseera kino ffe .
It’s a thing of beauty.	Kintu kya bulungi.
However, it is not always easy.	Kyokka, si bulijjo nti kyangu.
That was all he knew.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali amanyi.
Ready or not.	Mwetegefu oba nedda.
Right now, it’s not.	Mu kiseera kino, si bwe kiri.
No one has it all.	Tewali muntu yenna alina byonna.
He was on the floor.	Yali wansi.
But he was too happy to go home.	Naye yali musanyufu nnyo nga tasobola kudda waka.
From this position.	Okuva mu kifo kino.
It is a very important thing.	Kintu kikulu nnyo.
Maybe not so much.	Mpozzi si nnyo.
It is certainly a plan.	Mazima ddala nteekateeka.
You said you didn’t want to wait.	Wagamba nti toyagala kulinda.
This was not what he expected at all.	Kino si kye yali asuubira n’akatono.
And yet it was the same.	Era naye nga kye kimu.
This is my point.	Eno y’ensonga yange.
That’s important to me.	Ekyo kikulu gyendi.
He didn’t want to talk to anyone.	Yali tayagala kwogera na muntu yenna.
As he did.	Nga bwe yakola.
I will always be here.	Nja kubeera wano bulijjo.
Someone is talking to me.	Waliwo ayogera nange.
It could have easily happened.	Kyandibadde kyangu okubaawo.
This is a real problem.	Kino kizibu kya ddala.
But it was a little awkward.	Naye kyali kizibu katono.
She was too good to be true.	Yali mulungi nnyo nga tasobola kuba wa mazima.
He could be so many things.	Yali asobola okuba ebintu bingi nnyo.
This is not help.	Kino si buyambi.
However, I want to say this.	Kyokka kino njagala okwogera.
I don’t have a problem.	Sirina buzibu.
He needed .	Yali yeetaaga .
You don’t know how they are.	Tomanyi bwe bali.
He says it’s coming along.	Agamba nti kijja bulungi.
He probably has a brother, or something.	Oboolyawo alina muganda we, oba ekintu kyonna.
But no one can help.	Naye tewali asobola kuyamba.
And that was true.	Era ekyo kyali kituufu.
He went for that.	Yagenda ku ekyo.
Actually, it was a good thing.	Mu butuufu, kyali kintu kirungi.
He saw why.	Yalaba lwaki.
I will be here for a long time.	Nja kubeera wano okumala ebbanga ddene.
He would like to know what they are.	Yandiyagadde okumanya kye bali.
He can’t believe he’s doing that.	Ye tayinza kukkiriza ng’akola ekyo.
A loner will stay alone.	Omuntu ali yekka ajja kusigala yekka.
You were more than a friend.	Ggwe wali okusinga mukwano gwange.
I was ready to go now.	Nali mwetegefu okugenda kati.
I think it can come down to who is the very best.	Ndowooza kiyinza okutuuka ku ani asinga ennyo.
He knew that she knew.	Yali akimanyi nti yali akimanyi.
It’s hard on both of us.	Kizibu ku ffembi.
And nobody wants to say that.	Era tewali ayagala kwogera ekyo.
They are close now.	Bali kumpi kati.
And it’s very difficult.	Era kizibu nnyo.
It wasn’t what he wanted at all.	Si kye yali ayagala n’akatono.
We need help.	Twetaaga obuyambi.
But you can’t.	Naye tosobola.
It was probably pretty cool.	Oboolyawo kyali kirungi nnyo.
See! 	Okulaba!
That, apparently, he did.	Ekyo, kirabika, yakikola.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
He felt it would be soon though.	Yawulira nti kijja kuba mu bbanga ttono wadde.
I am very very, really sorry.	Nze nnyo nnyo, ddala nsonyiwa.
I can do that again.	Ekyo nsobola okuddamu okukikola.
There is no desire to receive.	Tewali kwagala kufuna.
We really have nothing on him.	Mazima ddala tetulina kintu kyonna ku ye.
He couldn’t live with himself.	Yali tasobola kubeera na ye kennyini.
Not that you should.	Si nti wandibadde okola.
Not to anyone else.	Si eri omuntu omulala yenna.
I don’t think we deserve this.	Kino sirowooza nti tusaanidde.
It was all him.	Byonna yali ye.
If only that was all.	Singa ekyo kyokka kye kyali.
He said he had one.	Yagambye nti alina emu.
He will be down.	Ajja kuba wansi.
And I to see.	Era nze okulaba.
That would be costly.	Ekyo kyandibadde kya ssente nnyingi.
But he couldn’t believe that.	Naye ekyo yali tasobola kukkiriza.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
They were so close, now.	Baali kumpi nnyo, kati.
That’s a good idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kirungi.
I need to be working for everyone.	Nze nneetaaga okuba nga buli muntu akola.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
Lower than everyone else.	Wansi okusinga buli muntu.
This is the case at the moment.	Kino bwe kiri mu kiseera kino.
I wasn’t sure at all.	Nali sikakasa n’akatono.
But it was true.	Naye nga kituufu.
And something seems to be in the air.	Era ekintu kirabika kiri mu bbanga.
But, in practice, this is very difficult to do.	Naye, mu nkola, kino kizibu nnyo okukola.
He wanted her happy.	Yali ayagala musanyufu.
He didn’t want to see anything.	Yali tayagala kulaba kintu kyonna.
But it won’t last long.	Naye tekijja kumala bbanga ddene.
He was a young, strong, handsome man.	Yali musajja muto, wa maanyi, nga mulungi nnyo.
But we don’t have to deal with this.	Naye tetulina kukola ku nsonga eno.
He may have done this very well.	Kino ayinza okuba nga yakikola bulungi nnyo.
Maybe even next week.	Mpozzi ne wiiki ejja.
Probably, not exactly what you want.	Oboolyawo, si ekyo ddala ky’oyagala.
You’re at a party.	Oli ku mbaga.
Either way, he must have gotten help.	Mu ngeri yonna, ateekwa okuba nga yafuna obuyambi.
You can do this yourself at home.	Kino osobola okukikola ggwe kennyini awaka.
I thought you knew that.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo okimanyi.
There it is right in front.	Eyo gye kiri mu maaso ddala.
It seems odd, but maybe not.	Kirabika nga kizibu, naye mpozzi si bwe kiri.
He is well and good.	Ali bulungi era ali bulungi.
I have no idea what it is.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki kye kiri.
She is always his wife.	Bulijjo ye mukyala we.
I can’t even go on.	Sisobola na kugenda mu maaso.
I think we’ll be able to do that.	Ndowooza ekyo tujja kusobola okukikola.
However, it is not you.	Kyokka si ggwe.
He wanted to be home.	Yali ayagala kubeera waka.
And all of this.	Era bino byonna.
It was a blessing.	Kyali kya mukisa.
It's completely up to you.	Kiri gy'oli ddala.
We need each other to be safe.	Twetaaga buli omu okubeera obulungi.
And of course he had.	Era ddala yalina.
He was doing very well.	Yali akola bulungi nnyo.
However, it was what it was.	Kyokka, kye kyali.
That was mine.	Ekyo kyali kyange.
I said right.	Nagamba bulungi.
In fact, it isn’t.	Mu butuufu, si bwe kiri.
I feel like I want to stay here.	Mpulira nga njagala kusigala wano.
I’m not sure where it was.	Sikakasa gye kyali.
And he didn’t like anyone.	Era yali tayagala muntu yenna.
No, it’s not you.	Nedda, si ggwe.
He was glad he did.	Yali musanyufu nti yakikola.
He obviously didn't know what he was thinking.	Kya lwatu nti yali tamanyi kye yali alowooza.
You can go.	Osobola okugenda.
You know where you are from there.	Omanyi gy’oli okuva awo.
It’s not bad though.	Si kibi wadde.
It was a difficult thing.	Kyali kizibu.
And it always would be.	Era bulijjo kyandibadde.
My schedule was an hour.	Enteekateeka yange yali ya ssaawa emu.
That’s why he started driving.	Y’ensonga lwaki yatandika okuvuga mmotoka.
It wasn’t what he expected.	Si kye yali asuubira.
But they are in a strong position.	Naye bali mu mbeera ya maanyi.
This is exactly the case.	Kino ddala bwe kiri.
Not like what he did.	Si nga kye yakola.
There seems to be a problem.	Kirabika waliwo ekizibu.
He was a stranger to her.	Yali muntu gwe yali tamanyi.
There is everything here.	Wano waliwo buli kimu.
The problem is in the form of .	Obuzibu buli mu ngeri ya .
He said he would be there.	Yagamba nti ajja kubeerawo.
More than all this.	Okusinga bino byonna.
I want to go home.	Njagala kudda waka.
You have it, too.	Naawe olina.
I had nowhere to live either.	Nange nnali sirina we nnyinza kubeera.
Only one, in fact.	Omu yekka, mu butuufu.
I am not sure if there is one.	Sikakasa oba waliwo emu.
Of course, he had had enough.	Kya lwatu nti yali amaze okumala.
No help either.	Tewali kuyamba era.
If he can.	Singa asobola.
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
It is exactly what it is.	Kye kiri ddala.
My father always said that.	Taata bulijjo yayogera bw’atyo.
We have to move forward.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso.
This is actually a normal thing.	Kino mu butuufu kintu kya bulijjo.
However, there is a problem with all of this.	Kyokka, waliwo ekizibu mu bino byonna.
Now there is no one in the house.	Kati mu nnyumba tewali akola.
But you are not.	Naye ggwe si bwe kiri.
It was all he needed, now.	Kye kyokka kye yali yeetaaga, kati.
He wants to talk about me.	Ayagala kwogera ku nze.
He did it a long time ago.	Yakikola dda nnyo.
And alone .	Era yekka .
Not a father, yet.	Si taata, n’okutuusa kati.
He knew exactly what he did.	Yali amanyi bulungi kye yakola.
You don’t have to tell anyone.	Tolina kubuulira muntu yenna.
He thought maybe he could do it.	Yalowooza nti osanga asobola okukikola.
And you don’t have it.	Era ggwe tolina.
However, it really is very easy to do.	Kyokka, ddala kyangu nnyo okukola.
Actually, it was quite difficult.	Mu butuufu, kyali kizibu nnyo.
It’s okay to say no.	Si kibi okugamba nti nedda.
Just one of us.	Omu yekka ku ffe.
Like, so many.	Nga, bingi nnyo.
I don’t want to try to do this job myself.	Nze kennyini saagala kugezaako kukola mulimu guno.
I can easily imagine as well.	Nsobola bulungi okulowooza nga bwe kiri.
He did the only thing he could.	Yakola ekintu kyokka kye yali asobola.
He wanted to though.	Yali ayagala wadde.
And he knows that he is not that person now.	Era akimanyi nti kati si ye muntu oyo.
Today's date.	Olunaku lwa leero.
Indeed, he has been for a long time.	Mazima ddala, amaze ebbanga ddene.
That's what.	Ekyo kye ki...
And he knew it.	Era yali akimanyi.
As it is,	Nga bwe kiri, .
Here, there, and everywhere.	Wano, awo, ne buli wamu.
He's just everyone's friend.	Ye mukwano gwa buli muntu yekka.
One room.	Kisenge kimu.
He...	Ye...
It was almost a crisis.	Kumpi kyali kizibu.
That’s easy, very easy.	Ekyo kyangu, kyangu nnyo.
Until there is nothing.	Okutuusa nga tewali kintu kyonna.
And he has a phone.	Era alina essimu.
. . . .	.
Don’t go any further.	Togenda mu maaso.
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
That is the position now.	Ekyo kye kifo kati.
He doesn’t think it is.	Talowooza nti bwe kiri.
We just have to know what it is.	Tulina kumala kumanya kiki.
I love her as a friend.	Njagala nnyo nga mukwano gwange.
This is not a quick one.	Eno si ya mangu.
That’s nothing.	Ekyo si kintu kyonna.
We don’t have much time.	Tetulina budde bungi.
We are in the future.	Tuli mu maaso.
We’re all in this thing together.	Ffenna tuli mu kintu kino nga tuli wamu.
It is not true	Si kituufu .
But that's why.	Naye eyo y'ensonga lwaki.
About an hour ago.	Ssaawa nga emu emabega.
He tried, anyway.	Yagezaako, mu ngeri yonna.
Very good, too.	Kirungi nnyo, era.
It probably won’t happen.	Oboolyawo tekijja kubaawo.
Someone else in the room.	Omuntu omulala mu kisenge.
That was his point.	Eyo ye yali ensonga ye.
He couldn’t see his house.	Yali tasobola kulaba nnyumba ye.
He started to back away.	Yatandika okudda emabega.
It would be romantic, he said.	Kyandibadde kya mukwano, bwe yagambye.
Don't go.	Togenda.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
I was a good kid.	Nnali mwana mulungi.
It was going on.	Kyali kigenda mu maaso.
You know, it’s not real.	Omanyi, si kya ddala.
I hope something is going to happen.	Nsuubira nti waliwo ekigenda okubaawo.
He knows we will.	Akimanyi nti tujja.
But you know what it is.	Naye omanyi kye kiri.
It wasn’t the food.	Si emmere gye yali.
You have to do this thing.	Ekintu kino olina okukola.
He is afraid to be alone with me.	Atya okubeera nange yekka.
It was really beautiful.	Ddala kyali kirungi nnyo.
But now there is no time.	Naye kati tewali budde.
Now, that’s not true.	Kati, ekyo si kituufu.
Someone can help.	Omuntu asobola okuyamba.
He has it in him too.	Alina ne mu ye.
That he was harmless.	Nti yali talina bulabe.
Not nearly true.	Si kumpi kituufu.
I think it was there.	Ndowooza kyali awo.
He had something he wanted.	Yalina ky’ayagala.
I can’t go on with him.	Sisobola kugenda mu maaso naye.
At this point it wasn’t.	Mu kiseera kino si bwe kyali.
He can do almost anything.	Ayinza okukola kumpi ekintu kyonna.
You are beautiful and strong.	Ggwe mulungi era wa maanyi.
But more than this.	Naye okusinga kino.
He didn’t want this.	Kino yali tayagala.
You can’t stay here alone.	Tosobola kusigala wano wekka.
Maybe too regularly.	Mpozzi nga bulijjo nnyo.
He knew so much.	Yali amanyi bingi nnyo.
He was a human being, a child.	Yali muntu, mwana muto.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
He could have seen this coming.	Yandibadde asobola okulaba kino nga kijja.
He was probably in trouble.	Oboolyawo yali mu buzibu.
And that’s what we’re here for.	Era ekyo kye tuli wano.
That's why.	Ye nsonga lwaki...
But that is not the case.	Naye si bwe kiri nti bwe kiri.
He could see she was terrified of this.	Yali asobola okulaba nga kino yali atya nnyo.
However, your opinion really matters.	Kyokka, ddala endowooza yo nsonga.
No one was nearby.	Tewali yali kumpi awo.
He had to move on.	Yalina okugenda mu maaso.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
You’re not alone.	Si ggwe wekka.
You really can.	Ddala osobola.
You have to get out of there.	Olina okuva awo.
I thought about how much she loved it.	Nalowooza ku ngeri gye yali ayagala ennyo.
He is not a good person.	Si muntu mulungi.
It can only be.	Kiyinza kyokka.
But he would, in time.	Naye yandikoze, mu kiseera.
I don’t really care about the facts.	Sifaayo nnyo ku nsonga.
I love it though.	Njagala nnyo wadde.
I feel .	Mpulira .
He said he didn't need to know.	Yagambye nti teyeetaaga kumanya.
However, that won’t work.	Kyokka ekyo tekijja kukola.
That’s what he did.	Bw’atyo bwe yakola.
I know, that.	Nkimanyi, ekyo.
But you’ve been with me a long time.	Naye obadde nange ebbanga ddene.
You know it’s hard.	Omanyi nti kizibu.
But he can’t.	Naye tasobola.
He was ready to go.	Yali mwetegefu okugenda.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
Was it really just yesterday?' 	Ddala kyali kya jjo kyokka?’.
It’s not true at all.	Si kituufu n’akatono.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
He had been young.	Yali abadde muto.
You’re not the only one.	Ggwe wekka si bwe kiri.
I need to say .	Nze nneetaaga okugamba nti .
He didn’t want to be alone.	Yali tayagala kubeera yekka.
It’s not too difficult.	Si kizibu nnyo.
I really have to get home.	Ddala nnina okutuuka awaka.
I couldn’t even speak.	Nnali sisobola na kwogera.
That’s not a good idea.	Ekyo si kirowoozo kirungi.
And it’s very difficult.	Era nga kizibu nnyo.
But to me he will always be my son.	Naye gyendi bulijjo ajja kuba mwana wange.
This is really great.	Kino ddala kirungi nnyo.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
He is by no means alone in that.	Tali yekka n’akatono mu ekyo.
There are not many houses.	Ennyumba si nnyingi.
We’re going to do it.	Tugenda kukikola.
He didn’t know what to believe.	Yali tamanyi kya kukkiriza.
We don’t even have one.	Tetulina wadde emu.
But he was safe at the time.	Naye yali talina bulabe mu kiseera ekyo.
And it’s not entirely true.	Era si kituufu ddala.
I think you know what it is.	Ndowooza omanyi kye kiri.
Everyone has been with him.	Buli omu abadde naye.
But he was here.	Naye yali wano.
He shouldn’t be here.	Tasaanidde kubeera wano.
She was as good as can be.	Yali mulungi nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
He was alone in the house.	Yali yekka mu nnyumba.
The concept is here.	Endowooza eri wano.
I wanted that one.	Nnali njagala eyo.
He was really good.	Yali mulungi ddala.
Maybe that’s the whole point.	Mpozzi eyo y’ensonga yonna.
You can do this here.	Kino osobola okukikola wano.
In this case, you.	Mu mbeera eno, ggwe.
I wasn’t ready before.	Nze nali siri mwetegefu emabegako.
But apparently nothing.	Naye kirabika tewali kintu kyonna.
We are one now.	Tuli kimu kati.
My wife would probably like that.	Mukyala wange osanga ekyo yandiyagadde.
But you don’t have to.	Naye tolina kukikola.
It was a party.	Yali kabaga.
However, here he was.	Kyokka, wano we yali.
And that’s his wife.	Era oyo mukyala we.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
And that’s why we’re here today.	Era y’ensonga lwaki tuli wano leero.
I’m not there.	Nze siri awo.
Reluctantly, he agreed.	Nga tayagala, yakkiriza.
He felt it would stay the same.	Yawulira nti kijja kusigala nga bwe kiri.
But this is not the case today.	Naye kino si bwe kiri leero.
I was a human being.	Nze nali muntu.
That would be my luck.	Ekyo kyandibadde mukisa gwange.
I’m fine now.	Nze kati ndi bulungi.
At this point it is hard to see.	Mu kiseera kino kizibu okulaba.
I can’t wait to see what happens.	Siyinza kulinda kulaba kigenda mu maaso.
I won’t be alone.	Sijja kubeera nzekka.
And he was young, still.	Era yali muto, nga akyali.
He said he had no idea.	Yagambye nti talina kirowoozo kyonna.
I think it is.	Ndowooza bwe kiri.
It may have been the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kyali.
No reason at all.	Tewali nsonga n’akatono.
Perhaps he had.	Oboolyawo yalina.
There it was, suddenly, so much.	Eyo gye kyali, mu bwangu, bingi nnyo.
I’m sorry, but there it is.	Nsonyiwa naye awo we kiri.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
The reason why you are there.	Ensonga lwaki oli awo.
He thought quickly.	Yalowooza mangu.
And in the meantime.	Era mu kiseera kino.
But it was a beautiful thing to see.	Naye kyali kintu kirungi nnyo okulaba.
That, and .	Ekyo, era .
He didn’t want to at all.	Yali tayagala n’akatono.
I didn’t have that attitude.	Nze nali sirina ndowooza eyo.
Actually, it was anything but.	Mu butuufu, kyali kintu kyonna naye.
But in the meantime .	Naye mu kiseera kino .
It’s easier than this.	Kyangu okusinga kino.
No , no	Nedda nedda .
But it is very not easy.	Naye nnyo si kyangu.
He did as he pleased.	Yakola nga bwe yali ayagala.
Something was very complicated.	Ekintu kyali kizibu nnyo.
Now, one might.	Kati, omuntu ayinza.
I'm beautiful.	Ndi mulungi.
You don’t know what this is like.	Kino tomanyi bwe kiri.
But that’s not all.	Naye ekyo si kye kyokka.
He will bide his time.	Ajja kulinda obudde bwe.
I guess he has.	Ntebereza nti alina...
But there isn’t.	Naye tewali.
He is very happy that he is here.	Musanyufu nnyo nti ali wano.
Of course, there may be no one talking.	Kya lwatu nti ayinza okuba nga tewali muntu yenna ayogera.
You know, not really.	Omanyi, mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
Everyone would do their job.	Buli omu yandikoze omulimu gwe.
Tonight everyone looks great.	Ekiro kya leero buli omu alabika bulungi nnyo.
You have nothing to say.	Tolina kya kwogera.
You're not here.	Toli wa.
He can hit really hard.	Asobola okukuba ennyo ddala.
But very soon.	Naye mangu nnyo.
And he had been.	Era yali abadde.
But here we are.	Naye wano we tuli.
That’s probably not too hard.	Ekyo osanga si kizibu nnyo.
This may very well be the case.	Kino kiyinza bulungi nnyo okuba nga bwe kiri.
Always, always, always!.	Bulijjo, bulijjo, bulijjo!.
What do you want from me?.	Oyagala ki gyendi?.
He could see .	Yali asobola okulaba .
And that’s why.	Era y’ensonga lwaki.
He could go home .	Yali asobola okudda eka .
We don’t have time to talk about why.	Tetulina budde kwogera ku nsonga lwaki.
But the picture.	Naye ekifaananyi.
It’s not that kind of work.	Si mulimu gwa ngeri eyo.
I know we will do it.	Nkimanyi nti tujja kukikola.
He was really a person.	Ddala yali muntu.
He has been very interested.	Abadde ayagala nnyo.
I'll be fine by myself for a while.	Nja kuba bulungi nzekka okumala akaseera.
I really needed this.	Kino nnali nneetaaga nnyo.
I have very little hope.	Nnina essuubi ttono nnyo.
That’s going to be dangerous.	Ekyo kigenda kuba kya bulabe.
Who do you think	Ggwe olowooza ani .
A lot of that.	Bingi ku ebyo.
This is a possibility.	Kino kiyinza okubaawo.
He didn’t want to know.	Yali tayagala kumanya.
We can do it this way.	Tusobola okukikola mu ngeri eno.
He thought he was done.	Yalowooza nti amaze.
He is a thing.	Ye kintu.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
This is the case last week.	Kino bwe kiri wiiki ewedde.
It is with us.	Kiri naffe.
You will get everything from me.	Ojja kufuna buli kimu okuva gyendi.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
It will work all night.	Kijja kukola ekiro kyonna.
I am the only one.	Nze nze nzekka.
But mostly not true.	Naye okusinga si kituufu.
That is a very good thing.	Ekyo kintu kirungi nnyo.
That’s fine, whatever.	Ekyo kirungi, kyonna.
This is a real thing.	Kino kya ddala.
Very nice guy.	Omulungi ennyo.
You have to think ahead.	Olina okulowooza mu maaso.
I know one by one.	Nze mmanyi omu ku omu.
He's a nice guy and all.	Ye ggaayi mulungi era byonna.
And all of us.	Nange ffenna.
He was a poet.	Yali muyimbi.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
He agreed, actually.	Yakkiriza, mu butuufu.
And of course he agreed.	Era ddala yakkiriza.
It’s not for a man.	Si kya musajja.
You don’t really have to do this.	Kino tolina kukikola ddala.
He's at a party.	Ali ku kabaga.
This is just simple.	Kino kyangu kyokka.
He is a teacher.	Ye musomesa.
I have no idea how long.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku bbanga ki.
I love cars.	Njagala nnyo mmotoka.
But right now that’s all he is.	Naye mu kiseera kino ekyo kyokka ky’ali.
There is no one.	Tewali muntu yenna.
He seemed reluctant at the time.	Yalabika nga tayagala mu kiseera ekyo.
That is a very serious point.	Eyo nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
I'll do anything.	Nja kukola kyonna.
Now he thought he was.	Kati yalowooza nti yali.
That’s a good idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kirungi.
I don’t know anyone.	Sirina gwe mmanyi.
You think you can.	Olowooza osobola.
Not like me.	Si nga nze.
That’s all they were.	Ekyo kyokka kye baali.
Who knows, maybe he is.	Ani amanyi, mpozzi y’ali.
You work backwards from winning.	Okola okudda emabega okuva ku kuwangula.
What is it	Kiki ne .
I am alone with him.	Nze naye yekka.
I’m lucky this week.	Nnina omukisa wiiki eno.
Below you will see why.	Wansi ojja kulaba lwaki.
Not that being alone mattered.	Si nti okubeera wekka kyali kikulu.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
This is a good practice.	Eno nkola nnungi.
This is what he could do.	Kino kye yali asobola okukola.
It’s that time.	Kye kiseera ekyo.
If only you knew.	Singa wali omanyi.
It may well be the case.	Kiyinza bulungi okuba nga bwe kiri.
I’ve got a good job.	Nfunye omulimu omulungi.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
I can’t wait for it.	Nze sisobola kulinda.
We needed to eat dinner.	Twali twetaaga okulya ekyeggulo.
Which he immediately began to do.	Kye yatandika mangu okukola.
I am always alone.	Bulijjo mbeera nzekka.
It is difficult to speak clearly.	Kizibu okwogera obulungi.
As shown below.	Nga bwe kiri wansi.
When he did this, when he did that.	Bwe yakola kino, bwe yakola ekyo.
But we have to move forward.	Naye tulina okugenda mu maaso.
It can happen!.	Kiyinza okubaawo!.
Or that perhaps .	Oba nti mpozzi .
I love it here.	Njagala nnyo wano.
He's really good.	Ddala mulungi.
Everything he really wanted to know.	Byonna bye yali ayagala ennyo okumanya.
But this is easy.	Naye kino kyangu.
Here, or here.	Wano, oba wano.
One picture .	Ekifaananyi kimu .
Everyone watched, actually.	Buli omu yalaba, mu butuufu.
However, there is nothing wrong with it.	Kyokka, tewali kibi kyonna.
He couldn’t go on like that.	Yali tasobola kugenda mu maaso bw’atyo.
It was for me.	Kyali eri nze.
He knew where it was.	Yali amanyi gye kyali.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
He's a father.	Ye taata.
But that’s not all.	Naye ekyo si kye kyokka.
I almost wanted to go.	Nnali kumpi njagala kugenda.
This will never be enough again.	Kino tekijja kuddamu kumala.
And she looks good.	Era alabika bulungi.
Today was the day and it was him.	Leero lwe lunaku era ye yali.
At this point, we need to step back a bit.	Mu kiseera kino, twetaaga okudda emabega katono.
Something doesn’t matter.	Ekintu si kikulu.
And for me.	Era ku nze.
You certainly do.	Mazima ddala ggwe okola.
I know they’re there.	Nkimanyi nti bali awo.
Everyone wants things.	Buli muntu ayagala ebintu.
But not nearly enough.	Naye si kumpi kumala.
I am one of them.	Nze ndi omu.
I am not in a preaching mood.	Siri mu mbeera ya kubuulira.
Of course, he was better than that.	Kya lwatu nti yali asinga ekyo.
And not about yourself.	Era si ku ggwe kennyini.
That won’t work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola.
And maybe you should too.	Era mpozzi naawe wandibadde.
I was beautiful.	Nali mulungi.
It’s time to move on.	Kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
Currently .	Mu kiseera kino .
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
That’s just not true.	Ekyo si kituufu kyokka.
He would rather be.	Yandibadde asinga kuba.
I lived at home with my father.	Nali mbeera waka ne taata.
Everyone at school knows it.	Buli muntu ku ssomero akimanyi.
He knew that.	Ekyo yali akimanyi.
Today I have nothing.	Leero sirina kye nnina.
I will be more than ready.	Nja kuba mwetegefu okusinga.
But he couldn't speak.	Naye yali tasobola kwogera.
That is definitely not the case.	Ekyo mazima ddala si kye kituufu.
I have to stay here a little longer.	Nnina okumala wano akaseera katono.
He could hardly see.	Yali tasobola bulungi kulaba.
I knew that would do that.	Nali nkimanyi nti ekyo kijja kukola ekyo.
He might go to jail.	Ayinza okugenda mu kkomera.
My father was the same.	Taata naye yali bw’atyo.
You have to go to school.	Olina okugenda ku ssomero.
That doesn’t matter.	Ekyo si kikulu.
Like everyone was really alone.	Nga ddala buli omu yali yekka.
But that’s not realistic.	Naye ekyo si kya ddala.
I'll try it.	Nja kugezaako.
I think this is bad.	Ndowooza kino kibi.
I am that person.	Nze omuntu oyo.
I have no idea.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
He has to be with you.	Alina okuba naawe.
He may do very well alone.	Ayinza okukola obulungi ennyo yekka.
At home	Awaka .
And it’s difficult.	Era kizibu.
I feel very happy.	Mpulira nga ndi musanyufu nnyo.
I think it’s a great idea.	Ndowooza nti kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
It was a feeling he knew all too well.	Yali mpulira gye yali amanyi bulungi.
He couldn't believe it, but it was true.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza naye nga kituufu.
You are so close to me.	Ggwe kumpi nnyo nange.
Not without help.	Si nga tewali buyambi.
I hope you will come with us.	Nsuubira nti ojja kujja naffe.
I couldn’t see clearly.	Nnali sisobola kulaba bulungi.
Mostly it was true.	Okusinga kyali kituufu.
But you can do that too.	Naye ne ggwe osobola okukola ekyo.
I am ready to work .	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukola .
Being alone.	Okubeera wekka.
He was going to.	Yali agenda.
I love movies.	Njagala nnyo firimu.
Someone from work.	Omuntu okuva ku mulimu.
And he was alone.	Era yali yekka.
He doesn’t want to go to the hospital.	Tayagala kugenda mu ddwaaliro.
It will be just the two of us.	Kijja kuba ffembi ffekka.
I'm sure he wasn't well, though.	Nkakasa nti yali si bulungi, wadde.
And it’s not about something being everywhere, either.	Era si ku kintu okubeera buli wamu, era.
He was a lover.	Yali muganzi.
It’s certainly not too complicated.	Mazima ddala si kizibu nnyo.
He is nothing.	Ye si kintu kyonna.
I need to know you want to stay.	Nnina okumanya nti oyagala kusigala.
He was a good kid.	Yali mwana mulungi.
I am an ordinary person.	Ndi muntu wa bulijjo.
Like he wasn’t himself.	Nga bwe yali si ye kennyini.
All of us, you and me.	Ffenna, nze naawe.
And we can certainly do that.	Era ekyo mazima ddala tusobola okukikola.
Very strongly, in fact.	Mu maanyi nnyo, mu butuufu.
He did this now.	Kino yakikola kati.
This was dangerous.	Kino kyali kya bulabe.
He knew exactly what it was.	Yali amanyi bulungi kye kyali.
Please anyone.	Nsaba omuntu yenna.
Moving forward to you.	Okugenda mu maaso gy’oli.
Maybe you don’t even want to try.	Mpozzi nga toyagala na kugezaako.
It would be nice to have his money.	Kyandibadde kirungi okuba ne ssente ze.
And yet, here we are.	Era naye, wano we tuli.
I have to get out of here.	Nnina okuva wano.
He can drive a car.	Asobola okuvuga mmotoka.
Currently, the.	Mu kiseera kino nga...
I love this watch .	Njagala nnyo essaawa eno .
We are here to help.	Tuli wano okuyamba.
Now is the time for that.	Kati kye kiseera ekyo.
Everything is exactly the same.	Buli kimu kye kimu ddala.
We can’t do this.	Kino tetusobola kukikola.
I think we’re all the same.	Ndowooza ffenna tuli kimu.
I hope it’s not too easy for everyone.	Nsuubira nti si kyangu nnyo eri buli muntu.
I didn’t really care.	Nnali sifaayo nnyo.
I couldn’t go to school.	Nnali sisobola kugenda ku ssomero.
He spoke very, very well.	Yayogera bulungi nnyo nnyo.
He should have had it that way.	Yandibadde alina bw’atyo.
You have no idea why.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna ku nsonga lwaki.
I have no idea how to proceed.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ngeri gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso.
Who is so good at driving now.	Ani mulungi nnyo mu kuvuga mmotoka kati.
It’s really really great.	Ddala ddala kirungi nnyo.
I hope you love these too.	Nsuubira naawe oyagala nnyo bino.
But he was her friend.	Naye yali mukwano gwe.
Who knows for sure.	Ani amanyi bulungi.
They were fine.	Baali bulungi.
Everyone was very happy.	Buli omu yali musanyufu nnyo.
I want someone who knows how to do it.	Njagala amanyi okukikola.
I have no idea how to do this.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ngeri gye nnyinza kukola kino.
I really have to read the book.	Ddala nnina okusoma ekitabo.
It will work.	Kijja kukola.
Or my father.	Oba taata wange.
And how beautiful it is!.	Era nga kirungi nnyo!.
We will win.	Tujja kuwangula.
Now that was a good man.	Kati oyo yali musajja mulungi.
He is a very good doctor.	Musawo mulungi nnyo.
I had nothing.	Nnali sirina kintu kyonna.
No one knew where he lived.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yali abeera.
Everything was coming so hard and going so fast.	Buli kimu kyali kijja nga kizibu nnyo era nga kigenda mangu nnyo.
We are at home.	Tuli waka.
He worked well into the night.	Yakola bulungi okutuuka ekiro.
And, baby, that’s you.	Era, mwana wange, oyo ggwe.
Obviously, it’s great.	Kya lwatu nti kirungi nnyo.
However, this is not easy.	Kyokka kino si kyangu.
You know everything.	Omanyi buli kimu.
That doesn’t really matter.	Ekyo si kikulu nnyo.
But now that he was alone, he was afraid.	Naye kati bwe yali yekka, yali atya.
He wanted it this way.	Yali ayagala mu ngeri eno.
Actually, it probably wasn’t.	Mu butuufu, oboolyawo si bwe kyali.
I needed a phone.	Nnali nneetaaga essimu.
It’s bad for school, though.	Kibi ku ssomero, wadde.
This is normal.	Kino kya bulijjo.
I could do it myself.	Nze kennyini nnali nsobola okukikola.
That’s really all there is to it.	Ddala ekyo kyokka.
I was there that night.	Nnali awo ekiro ekyo.
That is very common.	Ekyo kya bulijjo nnyo.
One could not know.	Omuntu yali tayinza kumanya.
But it was him or me.	Naye yali ye oba nze.
Honestly, he didn’t need one.	Mu butuufu, yali teyeetaaga emu.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
Or all these things.	Oba ebintu bino byonna.
I didn’t want that.	Ekyo nnali saagala.
He wasn’t like that though.	Yali si bwe yali wadde.
Like we were supposed to be together.	Nga bwe twali tulina okubeera ffembi.
I really didn’t want to go.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kugenda.
If you could talk to him that would be great.	Singa osobola okwogera naye ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
But now he is the problem .	Naye kati ye buzibu .
He was my brother and friend.	Yali muganda wange era mukwano gwange.
More than you, a lot.	Okusinga ggwe, bingi.
Home and safe.	Awaka era nga tewali bulabe.
Which is a very difficult task.	Ekintu ekizibu ennyo omulimu.
Soon they were best friends.	Mu bbanga ttono baali ba mukwano nnyo.
But he had it.	Naye yalina.
He is my son.	Ye mwana wange.
All right, now.	Kirungi, kati.
With or without it, it is bound to happen.	Nga tulina oba nga tetulina, kituufu okubaawo.
We have to go.	Tulina okugenda.
This issue is very, very serious.	Ensonga eno ya maanyi nnyo nnyo.
It’s actually much more complicated than this.	Mu butuufu kizibu nnyo okusinga kino.
I like to think that it is.	Njagala okulowooza nti bwe kiri.
However, we probably each should.	Kyokka, oboolyawo buli omu tusaanidde.
He knew better, but he did it anyway.	Yali amanyi bulungi naye yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
Anyone else doing something like this before.	Omuntu omulala yenna akola ekintu nga kino emabegako.
That is what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
Maybe that’s all we need.	Mpozzi ekyo kyokka kye twetaaga.
You certainly don’t want yourself.	Mazima ddala toyagala ggwe kennyini.
Everyone wants a party.	Buli omu ayagala mbaga.
That’s a good answer.	Ekyo kya kuddamu kirungi.
That’s not too bad.	Ekyo si kibi nnyo.
But you will .	Naye ojja ku .
Everything is happening.	Buli kimu kigenda mu maaso.
We’ll be fine.	Tujja kuba bulungi.
Or he is asleep.	Oba yeebase.
You’re not alone.	Si ggwe wekka.
Indeed?.	Ddala ddala?.
It’s easy for you to talk.	Kyangu gyoli okwogera.
I was thinking too.	Nange nnali ndowooza.
This is on me, you know.	Kino kiri ku nze, omanyi.
It’s not a way to live.	Si ngeri ya kubeerawo.
No way at all.	Tewali ngeri yonna n’akatono.
I don’t want too much.	Saagala bingi.
No one could tell.	Tewali yali asobola kumanya.
But it’s here.	Naye kiri wano.
Now I'm sorry.	Kati nsonyiwa.
I could find something to do.	Nnali nsobola okufuna kye nkola.
He may have been telling the truth.	Ayinza okuba nga yali ayogera mazima.
But he was just a kid.	Naye nga mwana muto yekka.
You already know that.	Ekyo okimanyi dda.
He made a lot of money now.	Yafuna ssente nnyingi kati.
This is good for you.	Kino kirungi gy’oli.
I think he must have already done it.	Nze ndowooza nti ateekwa okuba nga yakola dda.
Not as well, but close.	Si bulungi nga bwe kiri, naye kumpi.
It is very accurate.	Kituufu nnyo.
This was it, he thought.	Kino kye kyali, bwe yalowooza.
He is now in prison.	Kati ali mu kkomera.
I’m here in trouble now.	Nze ndi wano mu buzibu kati.
Maybe you should go.	Mpozzi wandibadde ogenda.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
He had trouble speaking.	Yafuna obuzibu okwogera.
I’m not that guy.	Si nze oyo ggaayi.
You have to swim every day.	Olina okuwuga buli lunaku.
I am a practical person.	Ndi muntu wa nkola.
They were me.	Baali nze.
You are always behind.	Bulijjo oba okuba emabega.
I like to do well.	Njagala nnyo okukola obulungi.
No one knew it.	Tewali yali akimanyi.
Or at the moment .	Oba mu kiseera kino .
And here he was.	Era wano we yali.
He couldn’t eat.	Yali tasobola kulya.
I knew nothing about him.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
It was just too easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo kyokka.
We were very capable of doing things.	Twali tusobola nnyo okukola ebintu.
Probably good, probably right.	Oboolyawo kirungi, oboolyawo kituufu.
He didn't seem too bothered, now.	Yalabika nga talina buzibu bungi, kati.
It can happen to anyone.	Kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna.
And no, this is good.	Era nedda, kino kirungi.
The reason he came here.	Ensonga lwaki yajja wano.
But it’s not too bad.	Naye si kibi nnyo.
And it’s hard work.	Era mulimu gwa maanyi.
No one wanted to talk to him.	Tewali yali ayagala kwogera naye.
I’m doing a man.	Nze nkola musajja.
He didn't even deserve this.	Kino yali tasaanidde wadde.
And then there was me.	Era awo waliwo nze.
It's downstairs.	Kiri wansi.
He really wanted this.	Kino yali ayagala nnyo.
It is very important indeed.	Kikulu nnyo ddala.
He doesn't seem good.	Alabika si mulungi.
He had no place.	Yali talina kifo kyonna.
It will just be what it is.	Kijja kuba kye kiri kyokka.
You are so strong, you are stronger than any of us.	Oli wa maanyi nnyo, oli wa maanyi okusinga omuntu yenna ku ffe.
At that time	Mu kiseera ekyo .
Not much to do.	Si nnyo kukola.
He is with us now.	Ali naffe kati.
He's just a kid.	Ye mwana muto yekka.
In his car.	Mu mmotoka ye.
No, it’s not a bad thing.	Nedda, si kibi.
I was the only one there.	Nze nzekka nnali eyo.
It had to be .	Kyalina okuba nga .
I have been very involved in this group.	Mbadde nnyo mu kibiina kino.
I want to know who it is.	Njagala kumanya ani.
It’s not as complicated.	Si kizibu nga bwe kiri.
It was true, in a way.	Kyali kituufu, mu ngeri emu.
Although he wasn’t.	Wadde nga si bwe yali.
I didn’t want to go.	Nnali saagala kugenda.
We have a lot of everything.	Tulina bingi ku buli kimu.
This is my opinion.	Eno ye ndowooza yange.
I'll come.	Nja kujja.
Probably not, of course.	Oboolyawo si bwe yali, ddala.
With this here we go.	Nga kino wano tugenda.
That’s not really what’s happening.	Ekyo mu butuufu si kye kigenda mu maaso.
But you have to help.	Naye olina okuyamba.
You can’t let that happen.	Ekyo tosobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
He doesn’t have to stay here.	Talina kusigala wano.
We can certainly do this soon.	Mazima ddala kino tusobola okukikola mu bbanga ttono.
I don’t know why he said this.	Simanyi lwaki yayogera bino.
And no, no, no.	Era nedda nedda.
It’s true and you know it.	Kituufu era okimanyi.
For someone like me.	Ku muntu nga nze.
He hits hard.	Akuba nnyo.
You can’t have anything.	Tosobola kuba na kintu kyonna.
We cannot allow that to happen.	Ekyo tetusobola kukkiriza kubaawo.
These are a very serious problem.	Bino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
That's about that.	Ekyo kiri ku ekyo.
You can’t buy anything.	Tosobola kugula kintu kyonna.
I can make a career out of it.	Nsobola okukikola omulimu.
There seems to be no instant friendship.	Kirabika tewali mukwano gwa mangu.
And he does well.	Era akola bulungi.
He was very real.	Yali wa ddala nnyo.
The guy did an excellent job.	Ggaayi yakola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
But something .	Naye ekintu .
That wasn’t what he wanted.	Ekyo si kye yali ayagala.
You’ve been sick.	Obadde mulwadde.
He is my father.	Ye taata wange.
Not him either.	Si ye naye.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
It’s okay, and you don’t mind either.	Si kibi, era naawe tolina buzibu.
I don’t want to have to do that.	Saagala kuba na kukola ekyo.
The food went on.	Emmere yagenda mu maaso.
That was fine with me, of course.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi, ddala.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
And it’s easy.	Era kyangu.
Not even a phone.	Tewali wadde essimu.
He is probably my friend.	Oboolyawo ye mukwano gwange.
We have a police force.	Tulina poliisi.
In this way.	Mu ngeri eno.
Nothing worse than this.	Tewali kibi okusinga kino.
I will be there tomorrow.	Nja kubeerawo enkya.
I really need to talk to you.	Nze ddala nneetaaga okwogera naawe.
I have a problem with this too.	Kino nange nnina obuzibu.
Now that’s how it was.	Kati bwe kyali.
I don’t have it either.	Nze nange sirina.
He knew he had to do something.	Yali akimanyi nti alina ky’alina okukola.
Obviously it was.	Kya lwatu nti bwe kyali.
No one spoke to any of us.	Tewali yayogera na muntu yenna ku ffe.
Certainly, it is not.	Mazima ddala, si bwe kiri.
That would be a blessing.	Ekyo kyandibadde kya mukisa.
It’s what we’re going to do.	Kye tugenda okukola.
It's just there.	Kiri awo kyokka.
He was a very manly man now.	Yali musajja musajja nnyo kati.
Not much you didn’t have my brother.	Si bingi bye wali tolina muganda wange.
Here he was safe.	Wano yali talina bulabe.
I don’t care about the man.	Sifaayo ku musajja.
I feel as normal as anyone else.	Mpulira nga ndi wa bulijjo nga omuntu omulala yenna.
Something he couldn’t possibly want.	Ekintu kye yali tayinza kwagala.
He knew it was wrong.	Yali akimanyi nti kyali kibi.
I am a good person.	Ndi muntu mulungi.
I was very happy at home.	Nali musanyufu nnyo awaka.
I am not sure of the validity of this.	Sikakasa butuufu bwa nsonga eno.
There is nothing here.	Wano tewali kintu kyonna.
Or do absolutely nothing.	Oba okukola ekintu kyonna ddala.
We need money now.	Twetaaga ssente kati.
I think it would be good for you.	Ndowooza kyandibadde kirungi gyoli.
I felt like it wasn’t.	Nnali mpulira nga si bwe kiri.
He didn’t want anyone to know.	Yali tayagala muntu yenna kumanya.
It’s good and it’s bad.	Kirungi era kibi.
He could get pretty good at that.	Yali asobola okufuna obulungi ennyo mu ekyo.
Or he was very, very sick.	Oba yali mulwadde nnyo nnyo.
I had no choice.	Nnali sirina kya kukola.
And in a way .	Era mu ngeri .
However, this is clearly not the time.	Kyokka kirabika kino si kye kiseera.
Certainly not me.	Mazima ddala si nze.
Everything was very difficult.	Buli kimu kyali kizibu nnyo.
This is what .	Kino kye kiri ku .
I just don’t know how to proceed.	Nze simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kugenda mu maaso.
However, he did the job.	Kyokka, yakola omulimu.
He knew exactly where.	Yali amanyi bulungi wa.
He had been such a good kid.	Yali abadde mwana mulungi bw’atyo.
And indeed he does.	Era ddala akola bw’atyo.
That’s what we’re down to.	Ekyo kye tuli wansi.
He thought you might be.	Yalowooza nti oyinza okuba nga ggwe.
Then it was there.	Awo we kyali awo.
I hope this is not true.	Nsuubira nti kino si kituufu.
Like he couldn’t believe he was here.	Nga bwe yali tasobola kukkiriza nti yali wano.
I'll last about an hour.	Nja kumala essaawa nga emu.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
That will be good.	Ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
My father worked hard.	Taata yakola nnyo.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
Everyone was really nice.	Buli omu yali mulungi ddala.
Or so it was.	Oba bwe kyali.
I'm going to.	Nze njagala.
But not just anyone no one.	Naye si muntu yenna yekka tewali muntu yenna.
No it really isn’t.	Nedda ddala si bwe kiri.
But nothing good is happening here.	Naye wano tewali kirungi kigenda mu maaso.
I’m sure you probably know that.	Nkakasa nti osanga ekyo okimanyi.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
But he was not a good man.	Naye yali si musajja mulungi.
He said he would do it.	Yagambye nti agenda kukikola.
My wife is not very well.	Mukyala wange si bulungi nnyo.
It was a beautiful room.	Kyali kisenge kirungi nnyo.
And it’s so easy that anyone can do it.	Era kyangu nnyo nga omuntu yenna asobola okukikola.
And well he should.	Era bulungi yandibadde.
I know you know this.	Nkimanyi nti kino okimanyi.
Going to this place is a good idea.	Okugenda mu kifo kino kirowoozo kirungi.
You weren’t going to go.	Ggwe wali togenda kugenda.
But everything will be fine.	Naye buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi.
He was going to do that today.	Ekyo yali agenda kukikola leero.
You are nobody’s father.	Toli taata wa muntu yenna.
It's not a problem at all.	Si buzibu n'akatono.
It probably is somewhere.	Oboolyawo waliwo we kiri.
He will be ready.	Ajja kuba mwetegefu.
He must know that we are on him.	Ateekwa okumanya nti tuli ku ye.
I’m here all week.	Nze ndi wano wiiki yonna.
And he talked about.	Era yayogera ku.
This is the case here as well.	Kino kye kiri ne wano.
It’s much easier that way.	Kyangu nnyo mu ngeri eyo.
I'm not entirely sure though.	Sikakasa ddala wadde.
You know, whatever.	Omanyi, kyonna.
Now you are ready to go.	Kati oli mwetegefu okugenda.
he could see much better now.	yali asobola okulaba obulungi ennyo kati.
He didn't know what it was.	Yali tamanyi ki kye kyali.
We definitely need to act, and we need to fast.	Mazima ddala twetaaga okukola, era twetaaga mangu.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
I don’t want to do it either.	Nze nange saagala kukikola.
As it was then, so it is now.	Nga bwe kyali mu kiseera ekyo, kati bwe kiri.
But not just then.	Naye si mu kiseera ekyo kyokka.
Easy for me to say, of course.	Kyangu gyendi okugamba, ddala.
It is now on.	Kati kiri ku...
This is really happening now.	Kino ddala kigenda mu maaso kati.
He will work.	Ajja okukola.
He doesn't think clearly.	Talowooza bulungi.
It wasn’t something he really wanted to do.	Si kintu kye yali ayagala ennyo okukola.
That may have been true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kyali kituufu.
That would be a problem.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
You know things like this.	Omanyi ebintu nga bino.
It’s close.	Kiri kumpi.
I can’t even do that now.	Ekyo sisobola na kukikola kati.
That will come next week.	Ekyo kijja kujja wiiki ejja.
That's not the point.	Eyo si y'ensonga.
I love being with him.	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye.
But perhaps you do? 	Naye oboolyawo okimanyi?
. . . .	.
But it’s what’s going to happen.	Naye kye kigenda okubaawo.
This is my place.	Kino kye kifo kyange.
Everyone knew it.	Buli omu yali akimanyi.
He certainly wasn’t.	Mazima ddala si bwe yali.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
This is not unusual at all.	Kino si kya bulijjo n’akatono.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
He probably does it every day.	Oboolyawo akikola buli lunaku.
And of course, they were the same thing.	Era ddala, baali kintu kye kimu.
I guess it was something.	Ntebereza nti kyali kintu.
I hope this will help someone.	Nsuubira kino kijja kuyamba omuntu.
This is absolutely true.	Kino kituufu ddala.
I can definitely talk to him.	Nsobola ddala okwogera naye.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
You know that,’ he said.	Ekyo okimanyi,’ bwe yagamba.
He says that he is not.	Agamba nti si bw’atyo.
You have high hopes for my career.	Olina essuubi ddene mu mulimu gwange.
I have no interest in anything like that.	Sirina kye njagala ku kintu kyonna ng’ekyo.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali.
I thought what the hell.	Nalowooza nti kiki ekizibu.
I think it’s true though.	Nze ndowooza nti kituufu wadde.
However, nothing is true.	Kyokka, tewali kituufu kyonna.
Or his brother.	Oba muganda we.
We’re going to be here all night.	Tugenda kubeera wano ekiro kyonna.
I wanted to talk to everyone.	Nnali njagala okwogera ne buli muntu.
This is a serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi.
He said he needed to talk to you.	Yagambye nti yeetaaga okwogera naawe.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
He has to go home.	Alina okudda eka.
I have to stay awhile.	Nnina okumala akaseera.
But that’s not quite right.	Naye ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
It’s not just this.	Si kino kyokka.
That’s true, of course.	Ekyo kituufu, ddala.
He was just my best friend, my only friend.	Yali mukwano gwange yekka asinga, mukwano gwange yekka.
You know, we shouldn’t do that.	Omanyi ekyo tetulina kukikola.
But money isn’t everything.	Naye ssente si buli kimu.
He wanted one like mine.	Yali ayagala emu nga yange.
Back to work .	Okudda ku mulimu .
That is not true at all.	Ekyo si kituufu n’akatono.
I don’t know what to say right now.	Simanyi kya kwogera mu kiseera kino.
He said what he wanted.	Yayogera kye yali ayagala.
No one knows anything.	Tewali amanyi kintu kyonna.
Either that, or he was curious.	Oba ekyo, oba yali ayagala okumanya.
It can be very powerful.	Kiyinza okuba nga kya maanyi nnyo.
You are so young, and beautiful.	Oli muto nnyo, era mulungi.
This movie is a wedding.	Firimu eno ya mbaga.
It’s good to be here.	Kirungi okubeera wano.
You’re a man.	Oli musajja.
This thing is the thing.	Kino ekintu kye kintu.
I have no faith in anything.	Sirina kukkiriza mu kintu kyonna.
Why, of course it is.	Lwaki, ddala bwe kiri.
That’s right, right.	Ekyo kituufu, kituufu.
He couldn’t seem to do anything right.	Yalabika nga tasobola kukola kintu kyonna kituufu.
He must have been like that.	Ateekwa okuba nga bwe kyali.
Just like we are alone.	Nga bwe tuli ffekka.
Last weekend was the case.	Wiikendi ewedde ye yali nga bwe kyali.
Any or all of them.	Buli oba byonna.
And there are so many.	Era waliwo bingi nnyo.
Here, in the city.	Wano, mu kibuga.
He loves this arrangement.	Ayagala nnyo enteekateeka eno.
However, it was very difficult to do so.	Kyokka, kyali kizibu nnyo okukikola.
You have to get his blessing on this.	Olina okufuna omukisa gwe ku kino.
However, that is not the case at all.	Kyokka, ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
That’s a lot of it.	Ebyo bingi nnyo.
He didn’t need me.	Yali teyeetaaga nze.
That's why he is what he is.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki ye ky'ali.
Nobody comes here.	Tewali ajja wano.
He didn’t need to do that.	Yali teyeetaaga kukola ekyo.
I want to	Nze njagala .
He loved being with her.	Yali ayagala nnyo okubeera naye.
I had nothing to do.	Nnali sirina kye nkola.
I’m just being real.	Nze mbeera ya mazima kyokka.
I'm not sure about that.	Sikakasa ku ekyo.
They were strong.	Baali ba maanyi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
This is dangerous.	Kino kya bulabe.
I’ve been at home.	Mbadde waka.
On the classroom.	Ku kibiina.
No one had any money.	Tewali yalina ssente yonna.
Everyone is doing very well.	Buli omu akola bulungi nnyo.
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
Like your dog or cat.	Nga embwa yo oba embwa yo.
This was very, very difficult.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo nnyo.
Back to the relationship.	Okudda mu mukwano.
We all need to do it.	Ffenna twetaaga okukikola.
He wants one for himself.	Ayagala emu ku ye.
What a difficult thing.	Nga kizibu nnyo.
That's your point.	Eyo y'ensonga yo.
At the time, though, he was her.	Kyokka mu kiseera ekyo, ye yali ye.
I'm sure he can deliver what you want .	Nkakasa nti asobola okutuusa ky'oyagala .
It’s definitely not a good idea to do that.	Mazima ddala si kirungi kukola ekyo.
You have to make money.	Olina okukola ssente.
But no one knows for sure.	Naye tewali amanyi bulungi.
I don’t have much time.	Sirina budde bungi.
Maybe it’s happening right now.	Mpozzi nga kigenda mu maaso mu kiseera kino.
He had been very, very young.	Yali abadde muto nnyo nnyo.
He doesn’t know who or what.	Tamanyi ani oba kiki.
It is the process.	Ye nkola.
I think that’s a good thing.	Ndowooza nti ekyo kintu kirungi.
Maybe there is hope here.	Mpozzi wano waliwo essuubi.
I thought he could but maybe not.	Nalowooza nti asobola naye mpozzi nga tasobola.
There’s always that one guy.	Bulijjo waliwo ggaayi oyo omu.
. . . .	.
I wasn’t ready for them at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali siri mwetegefu gye bali.
I need to go now.	Nze nneetaaga okugenda kati.
Very nice house.	Ennyumba nnungi nnyo.
I know there a little bit.	Nze mmanyi eyo katono.
This is what he is trying to do.	Kino agezaako okukola.
But he was all there.	Naye ye yenna yali awo.
If they	Singa ba .
But in reality it is not.	Naye mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
That’s all we have today.	Ebyo byonna bye tulina leero.
It’s a great place to be working.	Kifo kirungi nnyo okubeera nga okola.
I don’t know myself.	Nze kennyini simanyi.
I'll do it now.	Nja kukikola kati.
I loved the food.	Nnali njagala nnyo emmere.
He said he would do that.	Yagambye nti ekyo agenda kukikola.
He will not speak well.	Tajja kwogera bulungi.
He is more of a morning person.	Asinga kuba muntu wa makya.
It was a good night.	Ekiro ekyo kyali kirungi.
And nobody wants that.	Era tewali ayagala ebyo.
There is no answer.	Tewali kuddamu.
When reading works.	Okusoma bwe kukola.
And this is why.	Era eno y’ensonga lwaki.
He has everyone.	Alina buli muntu.
I hope you are well.	Nsuubira nti oli bulungi.
He's not going to go.	Tagenda kugenda.
This can be very difficult.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
Tomorrow, how come you to me.	Enkya, ojja otya gyendi.
You have been good to us.	Obadde mulungi gye tuli.
He wants to know if it was real.	Ayagala okumanya oba kyali kya ddala.
There is this, and there is this.	Waliwo kino, era waliwo ne kino.
Now that no one is there.	Kati nga tewali muntu yenna.
I don’t know if he’s asleep or not.	Simanyi oba yeebase oba nedda.
Honestly, it’s a really bad idea.	Mu butuufu, ddala kirowoozo kibi.
He has a weekend.	Alina wiikendi.
Person to person.	Omuntu eri omuntu.
And well you might.	Era bulungi oyinza.
The house was too much trouble for him.	Ennyumba yali ya buzibu nnyo eri ye.
Fast, very fast.	Ya bwangu, ya bwangu nnyo.
It’s not my place.	Si kifo kyange.
Everyone knows this.	Kino buli omu akimanyi.
You are completely beautiful the way you are.	Oli mulungi ddala mu ngeri gy’oli.
He thought about what she said.	Yalowooza ku bye yayogera.
I’m the only one in the house.	Nze nzekka mu nnyumba.
You never know what’s going to happen.	Tomanyi kigenda kubaawo.
I know how to read.	Nze mmanyi okusoma.
He obviously has an agenda.	Kya lwatu nti alina agenda.
That would be better than what we have now.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi okusinga kye tulina kati.
He did this in a police car.	Kino yakikola mu mmotoka ya poliisi.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
We can’t live yesterday.	Tetusobola kubeerawo jjo.
Hope, it will work.	Essuubi, kijja kukola.
There is no answer.	Tewali kuddamu.
I have a lot of it.	Nnina bingi.
All together or one at a time.	Byonna wamu oba omu ku omu.
He got what he wanted.	Yafuna kye yali ayagala.
Glad you wanted one.	Musanyufu nti wali oyagala emu.
Not my friend.	Si mukwano gwange.
He's not that good.	Si mulungi bw'atyo.
It won’t be enough, even for us.	Tekijja kumala, ne bwe tuli.
I can imagine that scene.	Nsobola okulowooza ku kifo ekyo.
That is what we should do.	Ekyo kye tusaanidde okukola.
Now he actually knows what he wants.	Kati mu butuufu amanyi ky’ayagala.
You know that you.	Omanyi nti ggwe.
But even so.	Naye ne bwe kiri.
He could get out of his mind.	Yali asobola okuva mu ndowooza ye.
I am, of course.	Nze, ddala.
You probably already know this.	Kino osanga okimanyi dda.
Reading is important.	Okusoma kikulu.
But,   .	Naye, .
I have a lot of things.	Nnina ebintu bingi.
However, this	Kyokka oyo .
He has to be good.	Alina okuba obulungi.
But he had been eager.	Naye yali abadde ayagala nnyo.
No one wants to know.	Tewali ayagala kumanya.
And no, he is not like that at all.	Era nedda, tali bw’atyo n’akatono.
It was my turn.	Kyali kiseera kyange.
And this, and that, and this.	Era kino, ne ekyo, ne kino.
I am ready for this.	Kino ndi mwetegefu.
I want to know what they are.	Njagala kumanya kye bali.
I didn’t know how to respond.	Nnali simanyi ngeri ya kuddamu.
And that’s what it is.	Era ekyo kye kiri.
That was the way it was.	Eyo ye yali engeri gye kyali.
He won’t be back until morning.	Tajja kudda okutuusa ku makya.
But he won’t do it.	Naye tajja kukikola.
You need to go get help.	Olina okugenda okufuna obuyambi.
It’s not going anywhere.	Tewali we kigenda.
But he was the idea.	Naye ye yali ndowooza.
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
That was what it would be.	Oyo ye yali kye kyandibadde.
I'm glad you have.	Ndi musanyufu nti olina.
But that is much easier in theory than in practice.	Naye ekyo kyangu nnyo mu ndowooza okusinga mu nkola.
Everyone and everything.	Buli muntu na buli kimu.
But in this case, it’s true.	Naye mu mbeera eno, kituufu.
I know where that is.	Ekyo nkimanyi gye kiri.
I guess you know.	Ntebereza nti omanyi.
And that was one thing.	Era ekyo kyali kintu kimu.
No, something he would absolutely love.	Nedda, ekintu kye yandiyagadde ddala.
It’s really quite simple.	Ddala kyangu nnyo.
I wanted to believe.	Nnali njagala kukkiriza.
I want the reason.	Njagala ensonga.
I know how to swim.	Nze mmanyi okuwuga.
And this is very simple.	Era kino kyangu nnyo.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
And that's my point.	Era eyo y'ensonga yange.
It won’t last long now.	Tekijja kumala bbanga ddene kati.
You just have to work.	Olina okukola kyokka.
It’s hard to imagine this.	Kizibu okulowooza ku nsonga eno.
He wants to be near me.	Ayagala kubeera kumpi nange.
But there is one problem.	Naye waliwo ekizibu kimu.
But that’s the whole point.	Naye eyo y’ensonga yonna.
He was just terrified.	Yali atya nnyo kyokka.
You are mine now.	Oli wange kati.
This is true today.	Kino kituufu leero.
But now it is very difficult.	Naye kati kizibu nnyo.
He knew it.	Yali akimanyi.
It can only happen at the same time.	Kiyinza okubaawo mu kiseera kye kimu kyokka.
Nobody says anything.	Tewali ayogera kintu kyonna.
He's always known that father, of course.	Bulijjo abadde amanyi taata oyo, ddala.
It was actually quite good.	Mu butuufu kyali kirungi nnyo.
We cannot accept this.	Kino tetusobola kukkiriza.
And neither will you.	Era naawe tojja kukikola.
I am always planning.	Bulijjo nteekateeka.
That, at any rate, was what he was thinking.	Ekyo, mu ngeri yonna, kye yali alowooza.
But it was actually normal.	Naye mu butuufu kyali kya bulijjo.
For this.	Ku kino.
He was a human being.	Yali muntu.
As usual, as .	Nga bulijjo, nga .
And so did I.	Era nange.
Not only that, either.	Si ekyo kyokka, era.
He'll see what happens.	Ajja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
That’s always going to be my guy.	Oyo agenda kubeera ggaayi wange bulijjo.
As he was asleep.	Nga bwe yali yeebase.
He tried to back away.	Yagezaako okudda emabega.
He is a real person.	Ye muntu ddala.
Or you are.	Oba ggwe oli.
There was so much he couldn’t say.	Bingi nnyo bye yali tasobola kwogera.
But he couldn’t go.	Naye yali tasobola kugenda.
But this is not a normal situation.	Naye kino si mbeera ya bulijjo.
Tom couldn't believe it.	Tom yali tasobola kukkiriza.
That’s just not true you know.	Ekyo kyokka si kituufu omanyi.
It’s a very simple thing.	Kintu kyangu nnyo.
You know there is.	Omanyi nti waliwo.
And he is not a child.	Era si mwana muto.
Which he certainly did.	Ekyo mazima ddala kye yakola.
He loved watching her sleep.	Yali ayagala nnyo okulaba nga yeebase.
And that’s up to us.	Era ekyo kiri ku ffe.
Forward or backward.	Mu maaso oba emabega.
You said it didn’t matter.	Wagamba nti si kikulu.
Everything would be fine.	Buli kimu kyandibadde bulungi.
Not even every week.	Si wadde buli wiiki.
I’m doing anything.	Nze nkola ekintu kyonna.
But he couldn’t tell.	Naye yali tasobola kumanya.
He got that watch.	Yafuna essaawa eyo.
I thought maybe he was down here with you.	Nalowooza nti osanga yali wansi wano naawe.
And now you, of course.	Era kati ggwe, ddala.
Someone behind him.	Omuntu emabega we.
It’s a tough time, but you’re not alone.	Kiseera kizibu naye toli wekka.
And that is very important.	Era ekyo kikulu nnyo.
And he’s been good to us.	Era abadde mulungi gye tuli.
Or on whom.	Oba ku ani.
He knew that for a reason.	Ekyo yali akimanyi lwa nsonga.
He had to think ahead.	Yalina okulowooza mu maaso.
I really wanted to get home.	Nnali njagala nnyo okutuuka awaka.
Where are you from	Oli muntu wa .
He was powerless.	Yali talina maanyi.
Or he started working.	Oba yatandika okukola.
I hope it isn’t.	Nsuubira nti si bwe kiri.
Everyone will surely come.	Mazima ddala buli muntu ajja kujja.
I’m in this.	Nze ndi mu kino.
But also, whatever.	Naye era, kyonna.
I'm going to make a phone call.	Ngenda okukuba essimu.
You are a human being.	Oli muntu.
It may be the case now.	Kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri kati.
He was the only one to see.	Yali ye yekka okulaba.
We have all night.	Tulina ekiro kyonna.
He felt that now it would come.	Yawulira nti kati kijja kujja.
This is harder than it sounds.	Kino kizibu okusinga bwe kirabika.
She is my wife now.	Ye mukyala wange kati.
He seems to be doing pretty well.	Alabika akola bulungi nnyo.
He must be the one.	Ateekwa okuba nga ye.
I have no friends here.	Nze wano sirina mikwano.
I’m not going to tell anyone.	Sigenda kubuulira muntu yenna.
It’s not a friend.	Si mukwano.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
He didn’t know it would happen.	Yali tamanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
I am also a father.	Nze nange ndi taata.
Anyone could see that.	Ekyo omuntu yenna yali asobola okulaba.
No, it’s not good.	Nedda, si kirungi.
There was nothing he could do to help.	Tewali kye yali asobola kukola kuyamba.
As in coming home.	Nga bwe kiri mu kudda awaka.
Thinking about him.	Okulowooza ku ye.
We will talk about this.	Tujja kwogera ku nsonga eno.
And he doesn’t want that.	Era ekyo tayagala.
I feel lucky to win.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa okuwangula.
She loves dogs.	Ayagala nnyo embwa.
You can do that well.	Ekyo osobola okukikola obulungi.
We’re fine.	Tuli bulungi.
And it’s true.	Era kituufu.
He seemed to be doing.	Yalabika ng’akola...
However, there is a problem.	Kyokka waliwo ekizibu.
However, as always.	Kyokka nga bulijjo.
Doing this can be difficult.	Okukola kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
Not for a while now.	Si okumala akaseera kati.
I don't know what kind of problem.	Nze simanyi buzibu bwa ngeri ki.
But this was very important.	Naye kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
I am also unemployed.	Nze era sirina mulimu.
Of the weekend too.	Wa wiikendi naye.
Maybe not at all.	Mpozzi si bwe kiri n’akatono.
Everyone is still here.	Buli omu akyali wano.
I wonder about here.	Nze nneebuuza ku wano.
I have no problem coming here.	Sirina buzibu kujja wano.
Not now, maybe not always.	Si kati, mpozzi si bulijjo.
I love watching everything happen in the room.	Njagala nnyo okulaba buli kimu nga kigenda mu maaso mu kisenge.
We should all go.	Ffenna tusaanidde okugenda.
He's not going to drive.	Tagenda kuvuga.
This was a very low point.	Eno yali nsonga ya wansi nnyo.
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza.
The picture is true.	Ekifaananyi kya mazima.
But he did it.	Naye ye yakikola.
In theory, we can probably do it.	Mu ndowooza, osanga tusobola okukikola.
He doesn’t want to go.	Tayagala kugenda.
I have been very lonely.	Mbadde nzekka nnyo.
Tomorrow, you will be nothing to me.	Enkya, tojja kuba kintu kyonna gyendi.
It was that dog, you know.	Yali embwa eyo, omanyi.
Not consciously, perhaps.	Si mu kumanya, mpozzi.
And all of that.	Era ebyo byonna.
What he thought.	Kye yalowooza.
Apparently it is.	Kirabika bwe kiri.
But that wasn’t the point and he knew it.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga era yali akimanyi.
I have no idea and never will.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna era sijja kukikola.
He didn’t even know his brother.	Yali tamanyi na muganda we.
I’ve had plenty of time to think.	Nfunye obudde bungi okulowooza.
It’s easy for you to talk.	Kyangu gyoli okwogera.
I want to go home alone.	Njagala kudda waka nzekka.
That was love.	Ekyo kyali kwagala.
not even yourself.	si wadde ggwe kennyini.
Certainly, not now.	Mazima ddala, si bwe kiri kati.
He knew it was true.	Yali akimanyi nti kituufu.
He doesn't know for what it is.	Tamanyi lwa kiki kye kiri.
He hoped he was.	Yalina essuubi nti bwe yali.
Not like, maybe not like here.	Si nga, mpozzi si nga wano.
He thought she looked good, that she always had.	Yalowooza nti alabika bulungi, nti bulijjo yalina.
He was always talking about it.	Bulijjo yali ayogera ku nsonga eyo.
But that's the point.	Naye eyo y'ensonga.
We have before.	Tulina emabegako.
The plan is good.	Enteekateeka nnungi.
That was probably too good to be true.	Oboolyawo ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
He knew he was in the hospital.	Yali akimanyi nti ali mu ddwaaliro.
Night comes quickly.	Ekiro kijja mangu.
It wasn’t something he said.	Si kye kintu kye yayogera.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
We have to think hard.	Tulina okulowooza ennyo.
However, not here.	Kyokka si wano.
I didn’t know why not.	Nnali simanyi lwaki nedda.
Getting from here to there though will be difficult.	Okuva wano okutuuka eyo wadde kijja kuba kizibu.
They are to us as we are to them.	Bali gye tuli nga naffe bwe tuli gye bali.
Any of us would have.	Omuntu yenna ku ffe yandibadde.
I have it with me now.	Nnina nange kati.
I'm still working.	N'okutuusa kati nze nkola.
This was certainly true.	Kino mazima ddala kyali kituufu.
He started to back away.	Yatandika okudda emabega.
All that today.	Ebyo byonna leero.
He wasn’t going to be here for long.	Yali tagenda kubeera wano okumala ebbanga ddene.
He just wanted to go home.	Yali ayagala kudda waka kyokka.
He was just a human being.	Yali muntu yekka.
Although he was.	Wadde nga yali.
What an eyesore, he thought.	Nga kizibu kya maaso, bwe yalowooza.
However, he doesn’t have to.	Kyokka talina kukikola.
But you don’t have to do this.	Naye kino tolina kukikola.
He is happy to be himself.	Ali musanyufu okubeera ye kennyini.
He did his job.	Yakola omulimu gwe.
You are not ordinary.	Toli wa bulijjo.
He is a real child.	Ye mwana ddala.
It was him well.	Yali ye bulungi.
When he was in town, you were in the office.	Bwe yali mu kibuga, ggwe wali mu ofiisi.
I know what’s going on.	Nze mmanyi ekigenda mu maaso.
It’s all very right to be here with me.	Kyonna kituufu nnyo okubeera wano nange.
It is there or not.	Kiri awo oba nedda.
That’s money.	Ekyo ssente.
I’m sorry for everything.	Nsonyiwa buli kimu.
He does it well.	Akikola bulungi.
It doesn’t matter at all.	Si kikulu n’akatono.
Right now, nothing seems to be happening.	Mu kiseera kino, tewali kirabika kigenda mu maaso.
I love it so much.	Nze njagala nnyo.
He needs a friend.	Yeetaaga mukwano gwe.
You mostly read.	Ggwe okusinga okusoma.
When you were	Bwe wali .
It’s really nothing.	Mu butuufu si kintu kyonna.
It is better to leave this way.	Kirungi okuva mu ngeri eno.
He knew he didn’t have long.	Yali akimanyi nti talina bbanga ddene.
I feel a little better.	Mpulira bulungi katono.
This is not the point.	Eno si y’ensonga.
But you are not my girlfriend.	Naye ggwe toli muganzi wange.
I thought you wouldn’t.	Nnalowooza nti tojja kukikola.
In the room.	Mu kisenge.
Now this is it.	Kati kino.
No, it is not.	Nedda si bwe kiri.
That was all it was.	Ekyo kyokka kye kyali.
That was him.	Oyo ye yali ye.
That is very common.	Ekyo kya bulijjo nnyo.
You want to try it.	Oyagala kugezaako.
And he still doesn’t know.	Era n’okutuusa kati tamanyi.
You should have gone.	Wandibadde ogenda.
Not here.	Si wano.
He didn't know what to do now.	Yali tamanyi kye yalina kukola kati.
You know what it looks like.	Omanyi bwe kirabika.
If he was to go.	Singa yali wa kugenda.
I was planning ahead.	Nnali nteekateeka nga bukyali.
It is very, very easy to do.	Kyangu nnyo nnyo okukola.
I imagine you will work with me.	Ntebereza nti ojja kukola nange.
You’re just a kid.	Oli mwana muto yekka.
It was very beautiful.	Yali nnungi nnyo.
No idea since when.	Tewali kirowoozo okuva ddi.
He seems to be asleep.	Alabika yeebase.
That’s what it is.	Kye kiri.
That was all it was.	Ekyo kyonna kye kyali.
But he’s not alone in this.	Naye si ye yekka mu kino.
It’s not a lucky thing to be.	Si kintu kya mukisa okubeera.
Not everyone was happy.	Si buli muntu nti yali musanyufu.
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo .
But we can’t do without it.	Naye tetusobola kukola nga tetulina.
You want to.	Ggwe oyagala.
You will agree with that too.	Ne ggwe ojja kukkiriza ekyo.
I feel so much better now.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo kati.
Always had before.	Bulijjo yalina emabegako.
I don’t know how it is.	Simanyi bwe kiri.
Whatever we have to do, we can do.	Kyonna kye tulina okukola, tusobola okukola.
This is what it was.	Kino kye kyali.
Attitude is a real issue here.	Endowooza nsonga ya ddala wano.
You know all this.	Bino byonna omanyi.
I said that we are.	Nagamba nti ffe.
He can’t stay here.	Tasobola kusigala wano.
You don’t have to go either.	Naawe tolina kugenda.
I don’t really like it there.	Sikyagala nnyo eyo.
I really feel a lot.	Ddala mpulira nnyo.
You are a sick woman.	Oli mukyala mulwadde.
But that’s next week.	Naye eyo wiiki ejja.
I am definitely ready to go.	Mazima ddala ndi mwetegefu okugenda.
That’s perfectly fine and normal.	Ekyo kirungi ddala era kya bulijjo.
And that’s a problem.	Era ekyo kizibu.
This is not what is happening here.	Kino si kye kigenda mu maaso wano.
Now, he did it.	Kati, yakikola.
You’re ready.	Oli mwetegefu.
But what’s the problem, you can’t have everything.	Naye kiki ekizibu, tosobola kuba na buli kimu.
It’s true for me.	Kituufu gyendi.
Now, to the problem.	Kati, eri ekizibu.
Not even thinking.	Si wadde okulowooza.
I’m just glad it was me.	Nze ndi musanyufu kyokka nti nali nze.
Everything was right for me.	Buli kimu kyali kituufu gyendi.
No, it’s pretty good.	Nedda, kirungi nnyo.
Indeed, they were.	Ddala, baali.
He was a strong man.	Yali musajja wa maanyi.
You're a problem.	Oli kizibu.
But we have to go a little further.	Naye tulina okugenda mu maaso katono.
He wants to come here.	Ayagala kujja wano.
He himself is so asleep.	Ye kennyini yeebase bw’atyo.
All of that .	Ebyo byonna .
I’m the only one.	Nze nzekka.
You will see him coming this morning.	Ojja kulaba nga ajja enkya ya leero.
He had no idea anyone knew.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna nti waliwo amanyi.
That’s not the point here.	Eyo si y’ensonga wano.
Of course, that was true.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo kyali kituufu.
I’m on here every day.	Nze ndi ku wano buli lunaku.
But he knows he has a job.	Naye akimanyi nti alina omulimu.
I wish you were here for my wedding.	Njagala wandibadde wano ku mbaga yange.
No, that’s not really the case.	Nedda, ekyo si bwe kiri ddala.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
I have to know what everyone wants.	Nnina okumanya buli omu ky’ayagala.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
You know you have to do it.	Omanyi nti olina okukikola.
We are not the issue.	Si ffe ensonga.
He did his job.	Yakola omulimu gwe.
It would be good for you.	Kyandibadde kirungi gy’oli.
But that’s neither here nor there.	Naye ekyo si wano wadde wali.
He was good at the time.	Yali mulungi mu kiseera ekyo.
He is a player.	Ye muzannyi.
He tried one.	Yagezaako emu.
Maybe that’s unusual, but there it is.	Mpozzi ekyo si kya bulijjo, naye awo we kiri.
And he was very, very good before.	Era yali mulungi nnyo nnyo emabegako.
How lucky they were.	Nga baali ba mukisa.
I love your opinion.	Njagala nnyo endowooza yo.
You already knew the problem.	Ekizibu wali okimanyi dda.
And you don’t have to.	Era tolina kukikola.
But he won’t do it.	Naye tajja kukikola.
Maybe he should be afraid.	Mpozzi yandibadde atya.
He had no idea.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna.
You don’t have to eat there.	Tolina kulya eyo.
However, it is time to move on.	Kyokka, kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
I am not a real person.	Siri muntu ddala.
I have to talk to him now.	Nnina okwogera naye kati.
And not just now.	Era si kati kyokka.
This was here way.	Kino kyali wano engeri.
It is a beautiful place to see.	Kifo kirungi nnyo okulaba.
Not even one .	Tewali wadde emu .
All these things.	Ebintu bino byonna.
He wants to win every day.	Ayagala kuwangula buli lunaku.
One indeed.	Omu ddala.
That was what he needed.	Ekyo kye yali yeetaaga.
I don't think so.	Nze ndowooza si bwe kiri.
I always wonder if he ever thought of me.	Bulijjo nneebuuza oba waliwo lwe yalowooza ku nze.
Maybe he is, too.	Mpozzi naye, naye.
You can do it yourself.	Ggwe kennyini osobola okukikola.
Maybe it should have been me.	Mpozzi nga yandibadde nze.
Money is not my issue.	Ssente si nsonga yange.
In but an hour.	Mu naye essaawa emu.
It was	Yali .
And you have to do it.	Era olina okukikola.
We have no idea what will happen.	Tetulina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki ekigenda okubaawo.
It’s a common thing.	Kintu kya bulijjo.
And that was the whole point.	Era eyo ye yali ensonga yonna.
He was ready to talk.	Yali mwetegefu okwogera.
Everything was fine, of course.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi, ddala.
He hopes it’s not the only one.	Asuubira nti si kye kyokka.
His younger brother doesn’t.	Muto we talina.
It’s just a place.	Kifo kyokka.
We shall shortly see that this is not the case.	Tujja kulaba mu bbanga ttono nti kino si bwe kiri.
It will be good to see everyone again.	Kijja kuba kirungi okuddamu okulaba buli muntu.
He would have done it.	Yandikoze.
I am a very, very person.	Nze ndi muntu nnyo nnyo.
Everything was just right.	Buli kimu kyali kituufu ddala.
I love anything and everything too.	Nange njagala nnyo ekintu kyonna ne buli kimu.
He is the only one.	Ye yekka yekka.
But he really doesn’t.	Naye ddala talina.
Although I was skeptical.	Wadde nga nnali nbuusabuusa.
You can see very clearly.	Osobola okulaba obulungi ennyo.
I know who it is.	Nze mmanyi ani.
I thought it was him.	Nalowooza nti ye yali.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
But not with you.	Naye si naawe.
It seems like almost everyone does it.	Kirabika kumpi buli muntu akikola.
It is a beautiful city.	Kibuga kirungi nnyo.
At no time did he need anyone’s help.	Tewali kiseera kyonna kye yali yeetaaga buyambi bwa muntu yenna.
It would be too hard to do alone.	Kyandibadde kizibu nnyo okukola wekka.
This will happen again.	Kino kijja kuddamu okubaawo.
You don’t have to say anything.	Tolina kwogera kintu kyonna.
That's why you can't get more.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tosobola kufuna bingi.
You will do it in the evening.	Ojja kukikola akawungeezi.
Although he wasn't quite sure of his position.	Wadde nga yali tamanyi bulungi kifo kye.
That is certainly true.	Ekyo mazima ddala kituufu.
I don’t even know how to talk to him.	Simanyi na kwogera naye.
But this is not really true.	Naye kino mu butuufu si kituufu.
He is still my brother.	Akyali muganda wange.
I didn’t know.	Nze nnali simanyi.
He loves it so much.	Ayagala nnyo.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
However, it was very important.	Kyokka kyali kikulu nnyo.
But we’re all together.	Naye ffenna tuli ffembi.
I'm not sure which.	Sikakasa ki.
I can do it better.	Nsobola okukikola obulungi.
He knew why.	Yali amanyi ensonga lwaki.
I feel like myself.	Nze mpulira nga nze kennyini.
No, not today.	Nedda, si leero.
You can’t be everything to everyone.	Tosobola kuba buli kimu eri buli muntu.
Apparently we are.	Kirabika ffe tuli.
He has something.	Alina ekintu.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
But he loves it .	Naye ayagala nnyo .
We can’t believe this is the case.	Tetusobola kukkiriza nti kino bwe kiri.
Good to have him here.	Kirungi okubeera naye wano.
I need my dad.	Nze nneetaaga taata wange.
Probably not for everyone.	Oboolyawo si ya buli muntu.
Now we are	Kati tuli .
I need help too.	Nze nange nneetaaga obuyambi.
I might just do that now.	Ekyo nnyinza okumala okukikola kati.
Same thing here.	Ekintu kye kimu wano.
From the hospital.	Okuva mu ddwaaliro.
He doesn't want to.	Tayagala.
No money, no friends.	Tewali ssente, tewali mikwano.
Every single opinion.	Buli ndowooza emu.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Naye ekyo kirabika si bwe kiri.
This house is .	Ennyumba eno eri .
Something that is going on.	Ekintu ekigenda mu maaso.
Or even, even .	Oba wadde, wadde .
But it is, it's just great.	Naye bwe kiri, kikulu nnyo kyokka.
It’s always either with him or with me.	Bulijjo oba oli naye oba nange.
He certainly isn’t.	Mazima ddala si bw’atyo.
We are in no hurry here.	Tetulina bwangu bwonna wano.
This was a fact.	Kino kyali kituufu.
You’re so young.	Oli muto nnyo.
We have a job to do.	Tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
That will probably do.	Ekyo osanga kijja kukola.
Everyone does it.	Buli omu akikola.
There it is, and it’s good.	Eyo gye kiri, era kirungi.
Of course, the dog was nice.	Kya lwatu nti embwa yali nnungi.
Not that my opinion matters about anything.	Si nti endowooza yange nsonga ku kintu kyonna.
That this was real.	Nti kino kyali kya ddala.
It’s hard to do.	Kizibu okukola.
You can do the same thing.	Naawe osobola okukola ekintu kye kimu.
However, this is more complicated than it seems.	Kyokka kino kizibu nnyo okusinga bwe kirabika.
This is a very complex process.	Eno nkola ya buzibu nnyo.
No, he couldn’t believe it.	Nedda, yali tasobola kukkiriza.
With him, I hope.	Nga tuli naye, nsuubira.
And to win.	Era okuwangula.
He told me it would be fine.	Yang’amba nti kyandibadde kirungi.
I hoped it would.	Nnali nsuubira nti kijja kukikola.
Not the police.	Si poliisi.
Like even at this time.	Nga ne mu kiseera kino.
He won’t do that.	Ekyo tajja kukikola.
This is what we deserve.	Kino kye tusaanidde.
But it really would have been nice if he did.	Naye ddala kyandibadde kirungi singa yakikola.
I know you’re not okay.	Nkimanyi nti toli bulungi.
He has to go.	Alina okugenda.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
In this way,.	Mu ngeri eno,...
It’s easy to say things like that.	Kyangu okwogera ebintu nga ebyo.
He was with us.	Yali naffe.
In fact, we should go now.	Mu butuufu, tusaanidde okugenda kati.
You are there or you are not.	Oli awo oba toli.
This thing will definitely be a problem.	Ekintu kino mazima ddala kijja kuba kizibu.
It is a serious problem for me.	Kizibu kya maanyi gyendi.
That can be a challenge.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
It would be a bad thing to do.	Kyandibadde kintu kibi okukola.
Perhaps it is.	Oboolyawo bwe kiri.
You have to work, actually.	Olina okukola, mu butuufu.
But back to that point.	Naye okudda ku nsonga eyo.
This is a real problem.	Kino kizibu kya ddala.
There are always these.	Bulijjo waliwo bino.
That’s how it would be.	Bwatyo bwe kyandibadde.
I’m pretty sure about that.	Nze nkakasa bulungi ku nsonga eyo.
Everyone is at risk .	Buli muntu ali mu bulabe .
My father told me that too.	Taata nange ekyo yang’amba.
We are all what we are.	Ffenna kye tuli.
He is very sick.	Mulwadde nnyo.
I feel right at home.	Mpulira nga ndi waka ddala.
She thought he was a man.	Yalowooza nti musajja.
I’ve been able to.	Nze mbadde nfunye.
I wanted to be an artist.	Nnali njagala kubeera muyimbi.
He had it here now.	Yalina wano kati.
I thought it would be easy.	Nalowooza nti kyandibadde kyangu.
He would need help with that.	Ekyo yandibadde yeetaaga obuyambi.
I didn’t know it would be hard.	Nnali simanyi nti kijja kuba kizibu.
But he doesn’t think so.	Naye talowooza bw’atyo.
But the problem isn’t just that.	Naye ekizibu si ekyo kyokka.
But there is a problem.	Naye waliwo obuzibu.
He certainly is, too.	Mazima ddala ye, naye.
Is it good or bad?.	Kirungi oba kibi?.
But that doesn’t really matter.	Naye ekyo mu butuufu si kikulu.
He was lucky and he knew it.	Yalina omukisa era yali akimanyi.
That is a very difficult thing! 	Ekyo kizibu nnyo!
It was something to behold.	Kyali kintu kya kulaba.
Or maybe earlier than that.	Oba mpozzi nga bukyali okusinga ekyo.
I have no reason to.	Sirina nsonga lwaki...
But he's probably happy too.	Naye oboolyawo naye musanyufu.
He is here now and here he will stay.	Ali wano kati era wano ajja kusigala.
He probably couldn’t love more.	Oboolyawo yali tasobola kwagala nnyo.
It is your house.	Ye nnyumba yo.
But he will be fine.	Naye ajja kuba bulungi.
Like, when exactly.	Nga, ddi ddala.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
And, apparently, he doesn’t.	Era, kirabika, talina.
You are not your house.	Si ggwe nnyumba yo.
Of course, we must also .	Kya lwatu nti tulina era .
That doesn’t matter.	Ekyo si nsonga.
Indeed, he had.	Mazima ddala, yalina.
And that’s me.	Era oyo nze.
I know that it is not.	Nkimanyi nti si bwe kiri.
But it’s my job to do all that.	Naye omulimu gwange okukola ebyo byonna.
It can absolutely.	Kiyinza ddala.
He went ahead.	Yagenda mu maaso.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
We are in this together.	Tuli mu kino nga tuli wamu.
Everyone in the office knows it.	Buli muntu ali mu ofiisi akimanyi.
All in time.	Byonna mu budde.
I was so beautiful.	Nnali mulungi nnyo.
But he knew what it was.	Naye yali amanyi kye kyali.
It will never happen again.	Tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
It always would have been.	Bulijjo kyandibadde.
Now, with	Kati, nga .
We can see so much.	Tusobola okulaba bingi nnyo.
You are beautiful.	Oli mulungi.
He knew everything.	Yali amanyi buli kimu.
You're in.	Oli mu.
And of course.	Era ddala.
I will stay with you.	Nja kusigala naawe.
Everything you want.	Buli kyoyagala.
He won’t say anything.	Tajja kwogera kintu kyonna.
He had to go.	Yalina okugenda.
I think that’s very important.	Ndowooza ekyo kikulu nnyo.
He thought everyone did.	Yalowooza nti buli muntu yakikola.
I love being in the city.	Njagala nnyo okubeera mu kibuga.
Now he was alone in the house.	Kati yali yekka mu nnyumba.
I just love it so much.	Nze njagala nnyo kyokka.
Tomorrow it could be someone else.	Enkya kiyinza okuba omuntu omulala.
You’ve always been an artist.	Bulijjo obadde muyimbi.
He had been home.	Yali abadde waka.
Everyone has something.	Buli muntu alina ky’alina.
I really hope we are.	Nsuubira nnyo nti tuli.
But he was already there.	Naye yali awo dda.
I was very sick.	Nnali mulwadde nnyo.
I, of course, have always known this.	Nze, ddala, kino bulijjo nkimanyi.
It’s not you.	Si ye ggwe.
You can do whatever you want.	Osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
. . . .	.
Not just at the moment! 	Si mu kiseera kino kyokka!
. . . .	.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kye kimu.
I wanted everything.	Nnali njagala buli kimu.
We don’t have time for that kind of thing.	Tetulina budde bwa kintu kya ngeri eyo.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kye kimu.
I want your opinion.	Njagala endowooza yo.
That person is probably me or someone like me.	Omuntu oyo osanga nze oba omuntu nga nze.
Maybe he doesn’t know.	Mpozzi nga tamanyi.
I want the money.	Njagala ssente.
You have to work hard.	Olina okukola ennyo.
It’s mine now.	Kye kyange kati.
Nothing is as it seems.	Tewali kiri nga bwe kirabika.
No one is real.	Tewali muntu yenna wa ddala.
She was so beautiful .	Yali mulungi nnyo .
I didn’t have much.	Nnali sirina bingi.
No, he said.	Nedda, bwe yagambye.
That was very powerful.	Ekyo kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
But this is not my point here.	Naye eno si y’ensonga yange wano.
He just wasn’t going to do it.	Yali tagenda kukikola kyokka.
Not everyone wants to do that.	Ekyo si buli muntu nti ayagala kukikola.
And we need a lot more.	Era twetaaga nnyo nnyo.
You want to do it right.	Oyagala kukikola bulungi.
He didn’t know who he was.	Yali tamanyi ani gwe yali.
I don’t have any friends.	Nze sirina mikwano.
Quick and always timely response.	Okuddamu amangu era bulijjo mu budde.
However, that is not the case.	Kyokka, ekyo si bwe kiri.
You will see everyone again.	Ojja kuddamu okulaba buli muntu.
When he spoke to her.	Bwe yayogera naye.
Everyone is talking about it.	Buli omu ayogera ku nsonga eyo.
No one lives there.	Tewali muntu yenna abeera eyo.
I'm you.	Nze ggwe.
It’s hard to do everything.	Kizibu okukola buli kimu.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
To see my dog.	Okulaba embwa yange.
I know you have to.	Nkimanyi nti olina.
No one knew where.	Tewali yali amanyi wa.
But right now, it doesn’t matter.	Naye mu kiseera kino, si kikulu.
He just wanted to go home.	Yali ayagala kudda waka kyokka.
We cannot go on and on about it.	Tetusobola kugenda mu maaso na kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
He must be fast asleep now.	Kati ateekwa okuba nga yeebase nnyo.
The office was great though.	Ofiisi yali nnungi nnyo wadde.
No one has it.	Tewali muntu yenna alina.
You will have to read to know.	Ojja kuba olina okusoma okumanya.
And yes, this picture is real.	Era ye, ekifaananyi kino kya ddala.
I wanted to respond.	Nnali njagala kuddamu.
I guess that’s the truth.	Ntebereza nti ekyo kye kituufu.
He makes so many films.	Akola firimu nnyingi nnyo.
Everybody wants that thing.	Buli omu ayagala ekintu ekyo.
We will be here for a week.	Tujja kuba wano okumala wiiki emu.
Maybe it’s happening right now.	Mpozzi nga kigenda mu maaso mu kiseera kino.
It’s a little hard to say right now.	Kizibu katono okwogera mu kiseera kino.
Perhaps this is true.	Oboolyawo kino kituufu.
It’s time to do something.	Kye kiseera okukola ekintu.
Good job on this!.	Omulimu omulungi ku kino!.
He could go to his hometown.	Yali asobola okugenda mu kibuga kye.
He told me he was ready.	Yang’amba nti yali mwetegefu.
But now .	Naye kati .
That’s definitely the right thing to do.	Ekyo mazima ddala kintu kituufu okukola.
That was one thing.	Ekyo kyali kintu kimu.
He loves ya.	Ayagala nnyo ya.
I don’t know yet.	Simanyi na kati.
You can see why.	Oyinza okulaba ensonga lwaki.
I have to go now.	Nnina okugenda kati.
Maybe we should drive.	Mpozzi tusaanidde okuvuga.
He wasn’t well.	Yali si bulungi.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
And now it doesn’t matter.	Era kati si kikulu.
You knew he had something for you.	Obadde okimanyi nti alina ky’alina ku ggwe.
At that time it was .	Mu kiseera ekyo kye kyali .
We were both on the floor.	Ffembi twali wansi.
He is not here now.	Tali wano kati.
He was still my boyfriend to me.	Yali akyali muganzi wange gyendi.
Probably me.	Oboolyawo nze.
It’s not just that it looks human.	Si kya kuba nti kirabika muntu.
But point, it's just the same.	Naye nsonga, kye kimu kyokka.
I thought that was really cool.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo ddala kyali kirungi.
I’m the only person there.	Nze nzekka omuntu ali eyo.
And we were.	Era twali.
Shopping is so easy for me.	Okugula ebintu kyangu nnyo gyendi.
Not that he wanted to.	Si nti yali ayagala.
He doesn’t think he has it in him.	Talowooza nti alina mu ye.
Not a child, you.	Si mwana, ggwe.
I’ll be there at three.	Nja kubeerawo ku ssaawa ssatu.
No one in sight.	Tewali muntu yenna mu maaso.
I thought it would be her home.	Nalowooza nti yandibadde awaka we.
And it really is.	Era ddala bwe kiri.
Indeed, he did.	Mazima ddala, yakikola.
I’m sorry you’re so sick.	Nsonyiwa oli mulwadde nnyo.
Anyone can do it.	Omuntu yenna asobola okukola.
But, all that in time.	Naye, ebyo byonna mu kiseera.
There is no one to see.	Tewali muntu yenna wa kulaba.
And this, he is more than.	Era kino, asinga ku...
No way, but there it is.	Tewali ngeri yonna, naye awo we kiri.
It was just the right thing to do.	Kyali kituufu kyokka.
Saying things.	Okwogera ebintu.
Or in an hour.	Oba mu ssaawa emu.
But it wasn’t what he wanted.	Naye si kye yali ayagala.
How have you been	Obadde otya .
No one could.	Tewali yali asobola.
No method, he thought.	Tewali nkola, bwe yalowooza.
More you than me.	Okusinga ggwe okusinga nze.
It’s not something you really want to do.	Si kintu ky’oyagala ennyo okukola.
We have to do it ourselves.	Ffe tulina okukikola ffekka.
It 's going	Kigenda .
He alone cannot.	Ye yekka tasobola.
Not only that .	Si kyokka nti .
You have to go though.	Olina okugenda wadde.
Not very well.	Si bulungi nnyo.
You’re not in trouble.	Toli mu buzibu.
I think that was his only job.	Ndowooza ekyo kyokka kye kyali omulimu gwe.
He didn't know if he wanted to know.	Yali tamanyi oba yali ayagala kumanya.
We have to go now.	Tulina okugenda kati.
We’re all fine.	Ffenna tuli bulungi.
However, that was not the point.	Kyokka, eyo si ye yali ensonga.
No one can know what it was like.	Tewali ayinza kumanya bwe kyali.
He felt very powerless.	Yawulira nga talina maanyi nnyo.
And that’s the problem.	Era ekyo kye kizibu.
It was something like that.	Kyali kintu ng’ekyo.
They are, and they are not.	Bali, era si bwe bali.
In this case, he would be unable to drive.	Mu mbeera eno, yandibadde tasobola kuvuga.
He could do what he wanted with me.	Yali asobola okukola nange kye yali ayagala.
Right now .	Kati .
I guess we are.	Ntebereza nti tuli.
And that’s happening now.	Era ekyo kigenda mu maaso kati.
It can help recycle.	Kiyinza okuyamba okuddamu okukola ebintu.
Nothing is happening here.	Tewali kigenda mu maaso wano.
And the money.	Era ne ssente.
But he saw something in her.	Naye yalaba ekintu mu ye.
You know this, of course.	Kino okimanyi, ddala.
My job here.	Omulimu gwange wano.
Probably, he already knew.	Oboolyawo, yali amanyi dda.
I should have gone to school.	Nze wandibadde ngenda okusoma.
That will go away.	Ekyo kijja kugenda.
That you could do something like that.	Nti oyinza okukola ekintu ng’ekyo.
He had to move on.	Yalina okugenda mu maaso.
He needs to get out of here.	Yeetaaga okuva wano.
But we’ll see.	Naye tujja kulaba.
I just want to go home.	Njagala kudda waka kyokka.
But he wasn’t going to have a chance.	Naye yali tagenda kufuna mukisa.
I was busy all the time.	Nnali bbize buli kiseera.
That it was everything.	Nti kyali buli kimu.
But, he is here.	Naye, ali wano.
I want to see everything good in a person.	Njagala okulaba buli kirungi mu muntu.
Not anyone there now.	Si muntu yenna awo kati.
We just have to move forward.	Tulina kumala kugenda mu maaso.
I have this .	Nnina kino .
He would have been very .	Yandibadde nnyo .
I'm thinking.	Nze ndowooza.
He is a poet.	Ye muyimbi.
And maybe that’s a good thing.	Era mpozzi ekyo kintu kirungi.
It’s so easy to think about school, now.	Kyangu nnyo okulowooza ku ssomero, kati.
It was a powerful move.	Kyali kigenda kya maanyi.
It will be wonderful.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
But he has no idea, not really.	Naye talina kirowoozo kyonna, si ddala.
Now there is one.	Kati waliwo emu.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
And you can do whatever you want.	Era oyinza okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
And this is absolutely true.	Era kino ddala kituufu.
He did everything he had to do.	Yakola buli kye yali alina okukola.
And the	Era nga .
He must have heard everything.	Ateekwa okuba nga yawulira buli kimu.
Something he didn’t want I know.	Ekintu kye yali tayagala mmanyi.
His point is this.	Ensonga ye eri eno.
From here he could see everyone.	Okuva wano yali asobola okulaba buli muntu.
I think he really needs to do it.	Ndowooza ddala yeetaaga okukikola.
You have a reason.	Olina ensonga.
You have to see this.	Kino olina okulaba.
Either way, they were best friends.	Mu ngeri yonna, baali ba mukwano nnyo.
As it is now.	Nga bwe kiri kati.
I forgive a lot of things.	Nsonyiwa ebintu bingi.
You’ll be fine.	Ojja kuba bulungi.
This will be fine.	Kino kijja kuba bulungi.
I’m not really going to go.	Sigenda ddala kugenda.
He had been asleep for a long time.	Yali amaze ebbanga nga yeebase.
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
No, there isn't.	Nedda tewali.
That seems pretty low to me.	Ekyo kirabika nga kya wansi nnyo gyendi.
But all he had.	Naye byonna bye yalina.
Not his wife, another one.	Si mukyala we, omulala.
I think it would be.	Ndowooza kyandibadde.
But that’s all there is to it.	Naye ekyo kyokka kye kiri.
You have to work.	Olina okukola.
I’m the only one here.	Nze nzekka ali wano.
You will never do it again.	Tojja kuddamu kukikola.
That’s a good plan.	Eyo nteekateeka nnungi.
This is what we are together.	Kino tuli wamu.
It looks good, too.	Kirabika bulungi, era.
I was my best friend.	Nnali mukwano gwange nnyo.
This is very important to me.	Kino kikulu nnyo gyendi.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
That’s nothing.	Ebyo si kintu kyonna.
I think that’s what any of us really want.	Ndowooza ekyo omuntu yenna ku ffe ky’ayagala ddala.
You have to work hard at it.	Olina okukikola ennyo.
You can play play along with me.	Osobola okukuba okukuba wamu nange.
He had an opinion.	Yalina endowooza.
I always have my opinion.	Bulijjo nnina endowooza yange.
He is better than the other.	Asinga omulala.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
He didn’t know how to do it.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ya kukikola.
What, we have no idea.	Kiki, tetulina kirowoozo kyonna.
I'll stay behind here.	Nja kusigala emabega wano.
This is a good thing.	Kino kintu kirungi.
He was a stranger to her.	Yali muntu gwe yali tamanyi.
It’s perfect in my room.	Kituufu nnyo mu kisenge kyange.
Week after week.	Wiiki ku wiiki.
You can’t do much more than that.	Tosobola kukola bingi okusinga ekyo.
He knew that now.	Ekyo kati yali amanyi.
This is a little too simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo katono.
. . . .	.
She was a wonderful woman.	Yali mukyala mulungi nnyo.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
And now this .	Era kati kino .
He can’t do it again.	Tasobola kuddamu kukikola.
You know it, my son.	Okimanyi mwana wange.
And he had always been strong in faith.	Era bulijjo yali abadde wa maanyi mu kukkiriza.
It’s just that simple.	Kye kimu kyokka nga kyangu.
We have to get out of here.	Tulina okuva wano.
He was always more than a friend.	Bulijjo yali asinga mukwano gwange.
You’re a man, all right.	Oli musajja, kirungi.
I’m in no hurry.	Nze sirina bwangu bwonna.
We have to hit back a lot.	Tulina okukuba emabega nnyo.
The other is a man.	Omulala musajja.
Or doing something.	Oba okukola ekintu.
I was already here.	Nze nnali dda wano.
I was curious about it.	Nnali njagala nnyo okumanya ku nsonga eyo.
You are a good friend.	Oli mukwano mulungi.
He didn't know what he knew.	Yali tamanyi kye yali amanyi.
Looking beautiful and happy.	Nga olabika bulungi era nga musanyufu.
As my brother said, not so here.	Nga muganda wange bwe yagamba, wano si bwe kiri.
I could have done it.	Nnali nsobola okukola.
That’s what I love.	Ekyo kye njagala ennyo.
This is a normal, normal thing for everyone.	Kino kintu kya bulijjo, kya bulijjo eri buli muntu.
And he doesn't have to come here again.	Era talina kuddamu kujja wano.
A lot of driving for the day.	Okuvuga ennyo olunaku.
This is very, very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo nnyo.
And now you don’t have a job.	Era kati tolina mulimu.
I'm pretty sure.	Nze nkakasa bulungi.
But he thought so.	Naye yalowooza bw’atyo.
Maybe it’s the child.	Mpozzi nga ye mwana.
In fact, he is not.	Mu butuufu si bw’atyo.
Not even with him.	Si wadde naye.
I know that’s easy to say.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo kyangu okwogera.
I am not sure how to go about this.	Sikakasa ngeri ki gye nnyinza kugenda mu nsonga eno.
You will be my one, my only.	Ggwe ojja kuba omu wange, wange yekka.
But the bottom is the same.	Naye wansi kye kimu.
But so far, nothing, absolutely nothing.	Naye okutuusa kati, tewali, tewali ddala.
Now he was completely alone.	Kati yali yekka ddala.
No friends though.	Tewali mikwano wadde.
However, he is a strong man.	Kyokka ye musajja wa maanyi.
He would need time.	Yandibadde yeetaaga obudde.
He can’t say exactly what, or when.	Tasobola kwogera ddala kiki, oba ddi.
He wants to know who he is.	Ayagala nnyo okumanya ky’ali.
But still, you do what you want.	Naye era, okola ky’oyagala.
I will be with him soon.	Nja kubeera naye mu bbanga ttono.
Down he will come.	Wansi ajja kujja.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
Almost everyone is at risk.	Kumpi buli muntu ali mu bulabe.
He looks a little too .	Alabika nga katono nnyo .
Mostly, he is good.	Okusinga, mulungi.
When is the.	Ye ddi lwe...
You can do it yourself.	Ggwe kennyini osobola okukikola.
And nothing really matters except money.	Era tewali kikulu ddala okuggyako ssente.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
He didn't know she knew.	Yali tamanyi nti yali akimanyi.
That’s a friend.	Ekyo kya mukwano.
He thought that was pretty cool.	Yalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
. . . .	.
And anyone else.	Era oyo yenna omulala yenna.
I have another friend.	Nnina mukwano gwange omulala.
This is definitely a problem.	Kino mazima ddala kizibu.
And this is not something you want.	Era kino si kintu ky’oyagala.
I was thinking about myself.	Nali ndowooza ku nze.
He felt better already.	Yawulira bulungi dda.
It was a blessing, but now or not.	Yali ya mukisa, naye kati oba si bwe kiri.
I need some help.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi.
He is still in prison.	Akyali mu kkomera.
I feel good working here.	Mpulira bulungi nga nkola wano.
He doesn't know what to say.	Tamanyi kya kwogera.
My father was that way, actually.	Taata yali wa ngeri eyo, mu butuufu.
He does it himself.	Ye kennyini akikola.
He wanted it, very much.	Yali ayagala, nnyo.
But no, he had more than that.	Naye nedda, yalina okusinga ekyo.
But for a little while.	Naye akaseera katono.
He wasn’t ready to do it.	Yali si mwetegefu kukikola.
He just wanted to help.	Yali ayagala kuyamba kyokka.
That’s how he was now.	Bwatyo bwe yali kati.
I'm pretty sure he's in town, though.	Nkakasa bulungi nti ali mu kibuga, wadde.
He was glad they were in this together.	Yali musanyufu nti baali mu kino nga bali bombi.
He had to think clearly.	Yalina okulowooza obulungi.
However, that is for the average person.	Kyokka ekyo kya muntu wa bulijjo.
A picture here, a picture there.	Ekifaananyi wano, ekifaananyi awo.
He was glad he had someone.	Yali musanyufu nti alina omuntu.
It’s really powerful.	Ddala kya maanyi.
But he is nearby.	Naye ali kumpi awo.
It is very easy to read.	Kyangu nnyo okusoma.
He acted quickly.	Yakola mu bwangu.
That’s really, really easy.	Ekyo ddala, ddala kyangu.
In fact, that is not true.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si kituufu.
It was hard work, a picture.	Yali mulimu gwa maanyi, ekifaananyi.
You'll have to talk to him here.	Ojja kuba olina okwogera naye wano.
Maybe that’s what it is.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kiri.
Who wasn't real either.	Ani naye yali si wa ddala.
You can do that, of course.	Ekyo osobola okukikola, mazima ddala.
You know what’s going on.	Omanyi ekigenda mu maaso.
He was very friendly to me.	Yali wa mukwano nnyo gyendi.
This is very important to us.	Kino kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
It was a serious problem.	Kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
But there was no plan.	Naye nga tewali nteekateeka yonna.
They are in my house.	Bali mu nnyumba yange.
I can’t come today.	Sisobola kujja leero.
Then he knew it was coming.	Awo n’amanya nti kijja.
Very easy, of course.	Kyangu nnyo, ddala.
That’s easy to say.	Ekyo kyangu okwogera.
I have no idea that this will happen anytime soon.	Sirina ndowooza yonna nti kino kijja kubaawo mu bwangu.
And he’s not alone.	Era si yekka.
You can have him.	Osobola okuba naye.
But, it doesn’t matter.	Naye, si nsonga.
It’s not going to happen.	Si kya kubeerawo.
That, of course, is the problem.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo kye kizibu.
I can say all things.	Nsobola okwogera ebintu byonna.
And you want you.	Era oyagala ggwe.
We all need it.	Ffenna twetaaga.
My father had a car.	Taata yalina mmotoka.
However, I don’t know what this could be.	Kyokka simanyi kino kiyinza kuba ki.
And it’s easy.	Era kyangu.
However, it is probably too much time .	Kyokka, oboolyawo obudde bungi nnyo .
Nobody does it now.	Tewali akikola kati.
Not now or always.	Si kati oba bulijjo.
It would be like him thinking ahead.	Kyandibadde nga ye okulowooza mu maaso.
I won’t do that.	Ekyo sijja kukikola.
This is largely true.	Kino okusinga kituufu.
You have my blessing.	Olina omukisa gwange.
I’m pretty sure it’s true.	Nkakasa bulungi nti kituufu.
Has anyone at all.	Alina omuntu yenna n’akatono.
He really wanted to talk to her again.	Yali ayagala nnyo okuddamu okwogera naye.
I think, anyway.	Ndowooza, mu ngeri yonna.
He is very knowledgeable and knows his job.	Amanyi nnyo era amanyi omulimu gwe.
That’s pretty easy to do.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo okukola.
That’s what he wanted and what he thought would happen.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala ne kye yalowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I hope it isn’t.	Nsuubira nti si bwe kiri.
He had things.	Yalina ebintu.
It is definitely a job.	Mazima ddala mulimu.
With no one to answer to but myself.	Nga sirina gwe nnyinza kuddamu okuggyako nze kennyini.
He has to do it.	Alina okukikola.
It’s the only thing we can do right now.	Kye kintu kyokka kye tusobola okukola mu kiseera kino.
They are fine.	Bali bulungi.
He really didn't want to go, he didn't think he should.	Mu butuufu yali tayagala kugenda, yali talowooza nti yandibadde agenda.
It is his job.	Gwe mulimu gwe.
You won’t be coming with us.	Tojja kuba ojja naffe.
Not who else, who is better.	Si ani omulala, ani asinga.
I love that myself.	Ekyo nange kennyini njagala nnyo.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He knew he should have.	Yali amanyi nti yandibadde alina.
Of course, all of this is neither here nor there.	Kya lwatu nti bino byonna si wano wadde wali.
I didn’t have my car.	Mmotoka yange nnali sirina.
I know that, Dad.	Ekyo nkimanyi taata.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
I have been down for too long.	Mbadde wansi okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
I’m not very happy.	Nze siri musanyufu nnyo.
That’s what we need.	Ebyo twetaaga.
But it’s not money.	Naye si ssente.
But this is all my opinion.	Naye bino byonna ndowooza yange.
He was indeed a man.	Mazima ddala yali musajja.
Like, a good person.	Nga, omuntu omulungi.
I was in prison.	Nnali mu kkomera.
This was a serious problem for them.	Kino kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo gye bali.
You don’t want to come here.	Toyagala kujja wano.
He wants to be with you all the time.	Ayagala kubeera naawe buli kiseera.
In a sense we were.	Mu ngeri emu gye twali.
He probably won’t.	Oboolyawo tajja kukikola.
I don’t have time to be sick.	Sirina budde bwa kubeera mulwadde.
But you have to act now.	Naye olina okukola kati.
I can definitely do this.	Kino nsobola okukikola ddala.
And you were with you.	Naawe wali naawe.
He wanted to be friends.	Yali ayagala kubeera ba mukwano.
I have absolutely no time.	Sirina n’akatono budde.
And that’s a good thing, of course.	Era ekyo kintu kirungi, ddala.
Or he knows who.	Oba amanyi ani.
However, it was true.	Kyokka, kyali kituufu.
Or his brother.	Oba muganda we.
Not always, anyway.	Si bulijjo, mu ngeri yonna.
This was realistic.	Kino kyali kya ddala.
However, nothing great is easy.	Kyokka, tewali kintu kikulu kyangu.
He is happy.	Ye musanyufu.
No, he’s not here.	Nedda, tali wano.
He was very happy to do it.	Yali musanyufu nnyo okukikola.
I hear things.	Mpulira ebintu.
It would be easier for everyone if he left.	Kyandibadde kyangu eri buli muntu singa agenda.
But you don’t have to.	Naye tolina kukikola.
He did his thing.	Yakola ekintu kye.
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
He wasn’t a nice person though.	Yali si muntu mulungi wadde.
It is all now a thing of the past.	Byonna kati kintu kya dda.
In reality, though, none.	Kyokka mu butuufu, tewali.
And a beautiful one.	Era omulungi.
Today, he thinks.	Leero, alowooza.
He doesn’t have a job.	Talina mulimu.
But you have everything.	Naye ggwe olina buli kimu.
It’s something we need to do.	Kye kintu kye twetaaga okukola.
Although the.	Wadde nga...
It wasn’t him.	Si ye yali.
I think this is good.	Ndowooza kino kirungi.
Everyone lives like that here.	Buli muntu abeera bw’atyo wano.
In my own way.	Mu ngeri yange.
He loves to go home.	Ayagala nnyo okudda eka.
You have to know who it is.	Olina okumanya ani.
I'm still not sure.	Nze n'okutuusa kati sikakasa.
You should do the same thing.	Naawe wandibadde okola ekintu kye kimu.
She looked good too.	Yalabika bulungi naye.
Been thinking the exact same thing for a while.	Abadde alowooza ekintu kye kimu ddala okumala akaseera.
Nothing was too complicated.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyali kizibu nnyo.
He was a teacher.	Yali musomesa.
You have to be normal.	Olina okuba nga wa bulijjo.
I'll do it tomorrow.	Nja kukikola enkya.
There is no place for it.	Tewali kifo kiri.
We can’t see it.	Tetusobola kulaba.
No reason at all.	Tewali nsonga n’akatono.
My father is fine.	Taata wange ali bulungi.
It was very intimate.	Kyali kya mukwano nnyo.
But you can’t do that, of course.	Naye ekyo tosobola kukikola, ddala.
And you’re young.	Era oli muto.
There is nothing to eat.	Tewali kya kulya.
What a beautiful sight.	Nga kirungi nnyo.
But, he went to jail.	Naye, yagenda mu kkomera.
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
He prayed about it.	Yasaba ku nsonga eyo.
He was really good.	Yali mulungi ddala.
From there it would be an easy drive home.	Okuva awo kyandibadde kyangu okuvuga okudda eka.
I won’t have to see.	Sijja kuba na kulaba.
But he is only one man.	Naye ye musajja omu yekka.
You don’t have to do it.	Tolina kukikola.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
It was what he did.	Kyali kye yakola.
No one wants this.	Kino tewali ayagala.
I love it, now.	Njagala nnyo, kati.
I think he’s probably a really nice guy.	Ndowooza osanga ddala ggaayi mulungi.
It’s not too bad at all.	Si kibi nnyo n’akatono.
It must have been me.	Ateekwa okuba nga nali nze.
You don’t have to .	Tolina kukola .
It was a very, very good weekend.	Yali wiikendi nnungi nnyo nnyo.
This was realistic.	Kino kyali kya ddala.
Doing so will not be easy.	Okukola ekyo tekijja kuba kyangu.
He thought he wouldn't.	Yalowooza nti tajja kukikola.
Very soon now.	Mu bbanga ttono nnyo kati.
But it actually was.	Naye mu butuufu bwe kyali.
This was very easy.	Kino kyali kyangu nnyo.
This was the case with my patient.	Kino kye kyali ku mulwadde wange.
You have .	Olina .
I could do it tomorrow afternoon.	Nnali nsobola okukikola enkya akawungeezi.
It wasn’t a place he wanted to be.	Si kifo kye yali ayagala okubeera.
I was a child at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali mwana muto.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
I had no choice.	Nnali sirina kya kukola.
I think we will do it.	Ndowooza tujja kukikola.
He had to help.	Yalina okuyamba.
And now it’s on me.	Era kati kiri ku nze.
He said there was no money.	Yagambye nti tewali ssente.
Nothing to do, nothing to do.	Tewali kya kukola, tewali kya kukola.
He cannot be real.	Tayinza kuba wa ddala.
Please, none of this.	Nsaba, tewali ku bino.
Not really, anyway.	Si ddala, mu ngeri yonna.
But this was something he had to do.	Naye kino kyali kintu kye yalina okukola.
I almost wanted to.	Nze kumpi nnali njagala.
It’s not us.	Si ffe.
He’s always been like that.	Bulijjo abadde bw’atyo.
He will return to the police.	Ajja kudda ku poliisi.
My dear friend.	Mukwano gwange omulungi.
I will not	Sijja ku .
I have to go right now.	Nnina okugenda mu kiseera kino.
Maybe he had.	Mpozzi nga yalina.
He didn’t know who it was.	Yali tamanyi ani.
It will be dangerous.	Kijja kuba kya bulabe.
But you alone with you.	Naye ggwe wekka naawe.
But no one wanted to say anything about it.	Naye tewali yali ayagala kwogera kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
Actually tonight.	Mu butuufu ekiro kino.
I wanted to get his opinion.	Nnali njagala okufuna endowooza ye.
And, of course, you already know why.	Era, ddala, omanyi dda lwaki.
Is that the problem?.	Ekyo kye kizibu?.
It was very dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
I have been at work for a little while.	Mbadde ku mulimu okumala akaseera katono.
He is in the hospital.	Ali mu ddwaaliro.
Or maybe you would like one.	Oba oboolyawo wandyagadde emu.
On the bus.	Ku bbaasi.
I would love to help.	Njagala nnyo okuyamba.
But it’s much easier.	Naye kyangu nnyo.
He was visible, that’s why.	Yali alabika, y’ensonga lwaki.
I won’t have anything to say about that.	Ekyo sijja kuba na kye nnyinza kwogera.
What do you make of the fact that.	Okola ki ku nsonga nti.
It was very difficult to go.	Kyali kizibu nnyo okugenda.
But they were almost there.	Naye baali kumpi awo.
You don’t have to be like him.	Tolina kuba nga ye.
I won’t stay long.	Sijja kumala bbanga ddene.
No one seems too happy.	Tewali alabika nga musanyufu nnyo.
He came upon me.	Yajja ku nze.
You have to know .	Olina okumanya .
But we can’t do that.	Naye ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
From all the rest.	Okuva ku byonna.
It was important to be together.	Kyali kikulu okuba nga tuli wamu.
Not for long, though.	Kyokka si lwa bbanga ddene.
He was absolutely fine.	Yali bulungi ddala.
That was pretty easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo.
You'll have to go home now.	Ojja kuba olina okudda eka kati.
That is exactly the truth.	Ekyo kye kituufu ddala.
He worked hard.	Yakola nnyo.
In any case.	Mu mbeera yonna.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
That was a powerful moment.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
Now he was ready.	Kati yali mwetegefu.
But this won’t work.	Naye kino tekijja kukola.
The food was just everything.	Emmere yali ya buli kimu kyokka.
That’s pretty easy.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo.
As is the case with you.	Nga bwe kiri ku ggwe.
I really need help.	Nze nneetaaga nnyo obuyambi.
He didn't know what exactly it was.	Yali tamanyi kiki ddala kye kyali.
It’s completely up to you.	Kiri gy’oli ddala.
Right now .	Kati .
He has a book.	Alina ekitabo.
He was just being gay.	Yali abeera muganzi yekka.
He is obviously very good.	Kya lwatu nti mulungi nnyo.
I guess this is the problem.	Ntebereza nti kino kye kizibu.
I'll keep doing that tomorrow.	Ekyo nja kusigala nga nkola enkya.
He had to get out of here.	Yalina okuva wano.
This is just not realistic.	Kino si kya ddala kyokka.
But he wasn’t close yet.	Naye yali tannaba kumpi.
But we are fine.	Naye tuli bulungi.
He couldn't work out what it was.	Yali tasobola kukola ku kiki kye kyali.
It’s the same everywhere.	Buli wamu kye kimu.
It’s very, very important.	Kikulu nnyo, kikulu nnyo.
But in truth, that was it.	Naye mu mazima, ekyo kye kyali.
It’s always going to happen.	Bulijjo kigenda kubaawo.
Indeed, it is.	Mazima ddala, bwe kiri.
But we will do it.	Naye tujja kukikola.
That, in a sense, he has.	Ekyo, mu ngeri emu, ky’alina.
He loved my work and .	Yali ayagala nnyo omulimu gwange era .
He probably does.	Oboolyawo akikola.
And indeed he was.	Era ddala yali.
It’s very important to me.	Kikulu nnyo gyendi.
This, perhaps, he said.	Kino, mpozzi, bwe yagamba.
He's almost ready.	Abadde kumpi mwetegefu.
No one has it easy.	Tewali alina kyangu.
It’s not as easy as it sounds, you know.	Si kyangu nga bwe kirabika, omanyi.
Everyone had a job, whether everyone worked or not.	Buli omu yalina omulimu, oba buli omu yakola oba nedda.
He knew he couldn’t win.	Yali akimanyi nti tasobola kuwangula.
This is what we are.	Kino kye tuli.
But we need strength.	Naye twetaaga amaanyi.
But he was still a child.	Naye yali akyali mwana muto.
I'll talk to him tonight.	Nja kwogera naye ekiro kino.
Lucky, you can.	Omukisa, osobola.
It was both bad and good.	Kyali kibi nnyo era nga kirungi.
You were .	Ggwe wali .
You knew he knew.	Obadde okimanyi nti amanyi.
He does a really, really good job of that.	Ekyo akikola omulimu mulungi ddala, ddala.
I might get lucky.	Nnyinza okufuna omukisa.
I’m sure it’s not himself.	Nkakasa nti si ye kennyini.
We’ll see what happens.	Tujja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
Home is not a hospital.	Awaka si ddwaaliro.
You can, perhaps.	Oyinza, oboolyawo.
I had no idea.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
No, he couldn’t.	Nedda, yali tasobola.
It doesn’t matter when.	Si kikulu ddi.
He certainly would be.	Mazima ddala yandibadde bw’atyo.
He will probably be in class right now.	Oboolyawo ajja kuba mu kibiina mu kiseera kino.
I can though.	Nze nsobola wadde.
Or almost none.	Oba kumpi tewali.
He knew it.	Yali akimanyi.
No, what he heard.	Nedda, bye yawulira.
I can't find a way to do that.	Ekyo sisobola kufuna ngeri ya kukikola.
That’s dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe.
He was telling the truth.	Yali ayogera mazima.
This was excellent.	Kino kyali kirungi nnyo.
There is no telling how bad it is.	Tewali kubuulira ngeri kibi gye.
But it’s easy.	Naye kyangu.
But he can’t or won’t.	Naye tasobola oba tajja.
Or his dog, actually.	Oba embwa ye, mu butuufu.
I am constant and very friendly.	Ndi buli kiseera era ndi wa mukwano nnyo.
He doesn’t want anyone here to know.	Tayagala muntu yenna wano kumanya.
I love living there.	Njagala nnyo okubeera eyo.
That’s how we are.	Ffe bwe tuli.
And I .	Era nze .
Now that happens all the time.	Kati ekyo kigenda mu maaso buli kiseera.
That’s right.	Ekyo kituufu.
Not me, of course.	Si nze, ddala.
It was definitely a man.	Mazima ddala kyali musajja.
He didn’t like what he was thinking.	Yali tayagala bye yali alowooza.
You really can be yourself.	Ddala osobola okuba ggwe kennyini.
He wasn’t a human being.	Yali si muntu.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
We are his problem.	Ffe tuli kizibu kye.
In my opinion, you have.	Mu ndowooza yange, obadde...
What was he thinking? 	Kiki kye yali alowooza?
He was just that.	Yali bw’atyo yekka.
It comes down to availability.	Kijja wansi ku kubeerawo.
That’s what he was.	Ekyo kye yali.
It’s not an easy thing for us to do.	Si kintu kyangu gye tuli okukola.
It was all he wanted, or thought he wanted.	Kye kyokka kye yali ayagala, oba kye yali alowooza nti ayagala.
But there was just something.	Naye nga waliwo ekintu kyokka.
But he did well.	Naye yakola bulungi.
I guess this will be fine.	Ntebereza nti kino kijja kuba bulungi.
At this point, you need to consider everything.	Mu kiseera kino, olina okulowooza ku buli kimu.
He is very happy here.	Musanyufu nnyo wano.
I can’t say where.	Siyinza kwogera wa.
This could happen again.	Kino kiyinza okuddamu okubaawo.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
No work at all.	Tewali mulimu n’akatono.
There is no coming back from that.	Tewali kudda okuva mu ekyo.
He seems to be going right down.	Alabika agenda kugenda wansi ddala.
I knew nothing about him.	Nze nali sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
He is a very good doctor.	Musawo mulungi nnyo.
It’s really very difficult.	Ddala kizibu nnyo.
Everything to me.	Buli kimu gyendi.
And he was trying to do that.	Era ekyo yali agezaako okukikola.
It's me.	Ye nze.
I think it’s a great idea.	Ndowooza nti kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I thought he wouldn’t.	Nalowooza nti tajja kukikola.
She knew what he was thinking.	Yali amanyi kye yali alowooza.
That’s the problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu.
I’m not in jail maybe.	Nze siri mu kkomera mpozzi.
Home all morning.	Awaka enkya yonna.
We always needed money.	Bulijjo twali twetaaga ssente.
But one thing is always the case.	Naye ekintu kimu bulijjo bwe kiri.
Like everything else.	Nga buli kimu bwe kiri.
The problem isn’t you, it’s me.	Obuzibu si ggwe, nze.
He is fine now.	Ali bulungi kati.
We can’t go on.	Tetusobola kugenda mu maaso.
I’m going to win, I hope.	Ngenda kuwangula, nsuubira.
He wants to be friends with you.	Ayagala kuba mukwano naawe.
And this is the thing.	Era kino kye kintu.
He seems to have no idea himself.	Alabika ye kennyini talina kirowoozo kyonna.
I will do this again.	Kino nja kuddamu okukikola.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
However, nothing matters.	Kyokka, tewali kintu kikulu.
He didn’t need anything.	Yali talina kye yeetaaga.
I was happy as can be.	Nali musanyufu nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
Very good, too.	Kirungi nnyo, era.
This view is not an issue.	Endowooza eno si nsonga.
This is not a good thing.	Kino si kintu kirungi.
This is the problem.	Kino kye kizibu.
Both were truthful.	Bombi baali ba mazima.
You can think very quickly.	Osobola okulowooza amangu ennyo.
No one spoke up.	Tewali muntu yenna yayogera.
That’s a very complicated problem.	Ekyo kizibu kizibu nnyo.
Now this was a dangerous place.	Kati kino kyali kifo kya bulabe.
He is mine, and mine alone.	Ye wange, era wange nzekka.
I wanted time easier now.	Nnali njagala obudde bwangu kati.
Obviously not.	Kya lwatu si bwe kiri.
He acts immediately.	Akola amangu ddala.
You can go .	Osobola okugenda .
You are a singer.	Oli muyimbi.
Clearly, he was not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe yali.
And happy, almost.	Era nga musanyufu, kumpi.
Being down is his place.	Okubeera wansi kye kifo kye.
That’s what it was.	Ekyo kye kyali.
It comes in this form.	Kijja mu ngeri eno.
Good help is hard to come by.	Obuyambi obulungi buzibu okufuna.
We all need each other.	Ffenna twetaaga buli omu.
But you look good.	Naye olabika bulungi.
And, of course, himself.	Era, ddala, ye kennyini.
You know, no one was willing to do that.	Omanyi tewali yali mwetegefu kukola ekyo.
He would be better off in jail.	Yandibadde bulungi mu kkomera.
They were already here in town.	Baali dda wano mu kibuga.
He was quick about it.	Yali mangu ku nsonga eyo.
It had to be in me, like me.	Kyalina okuba mu nze, nga nze.
He's still there.	Akyali awo.
And then it wasn’t.	Era awo si bwe kyali.
That's what he said.	Bwatyo bwe yagamba.
Maybe it’s not.	Mpozzi si bwe kiri.
I want to be that dad.	Njagala kubeera taata oyo.
This, of course, is definitely not the case.	Kino, kya lwatu, mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
He has to get home.	Alina okutuuka awaka.
I think you should go.	Ndowooza wandibadde ogenda.
It belonged to my father.	Yali wa taata wange.
All he had now.	Byonna bye yali alina kati.
No, it’s not true.	Nedda, si kituufu.
And he had nothing.	Era tewali kyalina.
But he may not work.	Naye ayinza obutakola.
Everything was normal.	Buli kimu kyali kya bulijjo.
He won’t do it.	Tajja kukikola.
It’s actually a matter of faith.	Mu butuufu nsonga ya kukkiriza.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
And he has help.	Era alina obuyambi.
It’s something to behold.	Kintu kya kulaba.
That was always going to be a problem.	Ekyo bulijjo kyali kigenda kuba kizibu.
I could swim.	Nnali nsobola okuwuga.
They certainly are.	Mazima ddala bwe bali.
I think he might be my dad.	Ndowooza ayinza okuba nga ye taata wange.
He didn’t know he was here.	Yali tamanyi nti ali wano.
It is better to do than to do.	Kirungi okukola okusinga okukola.
Everything will be as it was.	Buli kimu kijja kuba nga bwe kyali.
Not a child, though.	Si mwana, naye.
I feel the same way.	Nze mpulira kye kimu.
I very nearly don’t care.	Nze kumpi nnyo sifaayo.
And you want it.	Era ggwe oyagala.
But that’s not entirely true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu ddala.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
He is such a nice man.	Ye musajja mulungi bwatyo.
That’s the right thing to do.	Kye kituufu.
Just him and me all the time.	Ye yekka nange buli kiseera.
Then he said.	Awo n’agamba nti.
I just love driving.	Nze njagala nnyo okuvuga.
This is a car.	Eno mmotoka.
He had a phone.	Yalina essimu.
Very easy to make at home.	Kyangu nnyo okukola awaka.
But it’s the same thing.	Naye kye kimu.
Not every plan worked.	Si buli nteekateeka nti yakola.
But it doesn’t matter.	Naye si kikulu.
Now that was pretty cool.	Kati ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
Everything will go on.	Buli kimu kijja kugenda mu maaso.
For the most part it seems pretty simple.	Okusinga kirabika nga kyangu nnyo.
Someone has to do it.	Waliwo alina okukikola.
I couldn’t even see.	Nnali sisobola na kulaba.
It’s not as complicated as it is now.	Si kizibu nnyo nga bwe kiri kati.
He got a job.	Yafuna omulimu.
It’s my office.	Ye ofiisi yange.
That 's right	Ekyo kituufu .
He is not a child.	Si mwana muto.
This is very difficult.	Kino kizibu nnyo.
He must be very lonely.	Ateekwa okuba nga yekka nnyo.
He didn't know how to answer that.	Ekyo yali tamanyi ngeri ya kuddamu.
No, he couldn’t do it.	Nedda, yali tasobola kukikola.
And for a while it was.	Era okumala akaseera bwe kyali.
He is on me.	Ali ku nze.
He didn’t want to talk to anyone.	Yali tayagala kwogera na muntu yenna.
I love that stuff.	Njagala nnyo ebintu ebyo.
It’s not always true.	Si kituufu bulijjo.
He had high expectations.	Yali asuubira ebintu bingi.
But not his father.	Kyokka si taata we.
The whole thing is that.	Ekintu kyonna kiri nti.
He had to hang up.	Yalina okuggyako essimu.
I thought you would.	Nnalowooza nti ojja kukikola.
He couldn't do that now.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukikola kati.
And it was .	Era kyali .
Here we go.	Wano we tugenda.
But he was trying to be nice.	Naye yali agezaako okubeera omulungi.
I love the guy.	Njagala nnyo ggaayi.
You are absolutely fine.	Oli bulungi ddala.
That won’t be good.	Ekyo tekijja kuba kirungi.
He is obviously doing well.	Kya lwatu nti akola bulungi.
Better.	Okusinga.
I am not the only one who knows this.	Kino si nze nzekka amanyi.
Excellent, excellent work.	Omulimu omulungi ennyo, omulungi ennyo.
The back is good.	Emabega kirungi.
He told me he was home.	Yang’amba nti yali waka.
I want to know why.	Njagala okumanya lwaki.
No one was asleep.	Tewali yali yeebase.
Herein lies the problem.	Wano we wali ekizibu.
I will try all of them.	Nja kugezaako byonna.
And of course that’s theoretically true.	Era ddala ekyo kituufu mu ndowooza.
That will come in time.	Ekyo kijja kujja mu kiseera.
But he was too young to go alone.	Naye yali muto nnyo nga tasobola kugenda yekka.
Now, for the most part this won’t be a problem.	Kati, okusinga kino tekijja kuba kizibu.
We were all there together.	Ffenna twali awo ffenna.
In fact, he doesn’t know much.	Mu butuufu, tamanyi bingi.
To me too.	Eri nze nange.
I just want to talk to him about that.	Njagala okwogera naye ekyo kyokka.
He is here but not here.	Ali wano naye si wano.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
Nobody has you.	Tewali muntu yenna alina ggwe.
This is certainly a very serious problem.	Kino mazima ddala kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
Everyone is in prison, of course.	Buli muntu ali mu kkomera, ddala.
I didn’t know you could do that.	Ekyo nnali simanyi nti osobola okukikola.
This is in the air.	Kino kiri mu bbanga.
He is still in the hospital.	Akyali mu ddwaaliro.
It is a beautiful city.	Kibuga kirungi nnyo.
You have a plan.	Olina enteekateeka.
We’re all here together.	Ffenna tuli wano wamu.
He isn’t the only one.	Si ye yekka.
And yet no.	Era naye nedda.
We’ll come back from this.	Tujja kudda okuva mu kino.
I want it right now.	Njagala mu kiseera kino.
But that was true.	Naye ekyo kyali kituufu.
In fact, he still was.	Mu butuufu, yali akyali mu kiseera ekyo.
I feel like I love it.	Mpulira nga njagala nnyo.
Good, he thought.	Kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
And he probably needed help.	Era oboolyawo yali yeetaaga obuyambi.
He said this is not true.	Yagambye nti kino si kituufu.
To get to this place.	Okutuuka mu kifo kino.
From this office.	Okuva mu ofiisi eno.
I want to know why.	Njagala okumanya lwaki.
He needed to know he could do this.	Yali yeetaaga okumanya nti kino asobola okukikola.
I have been very happy here.	Mbadde musanyufu nnyo wano.
Good job.	Omulimu mulungi.
And you can’t make a movie without that.	Era tosobola kukola firimu nga tolina ekyo.
As he would have done.	Nga bwe yandikoze.
It will be easier for you.	Kijja kuba kyangu gyoli.
He certainly doesn’t seem to be home right now.	Mazima ddala alabika tali waka mu kiseera kino.
Like a week really.	Nga wiiki ddala.
He can deal with issues.	Asobola okukola ku nsonga.
She is so young, she loves it.	Muto nnyo, ayagala nnyo.
That’s really a problem.	Ekyo ddala kizibu.
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
We can help.	Tusobola okuyamba.
We have so much more.	Tulina bingi nnyo.
That's what it is	Ekyo kye kiri .
He was very, very young.	Yali muto nnyo nnyo.
He couldn’t wait.	Yali tasobola kulinda.
Maybe he’s really really asleep.	Mpozzi nga yeebase ddala ddala.
And, of course, he wanted to win.	Era, kya lwatu, yali ayagala nnyo okuwangula.
In a way, he wanted this.	Mu ngeri emu, kino yali ayagala.
You may not have a job at all.	Oyinza okuba nga tolina mulimu n’akatono.
You have your bus.	Olina bbaasi yo.
He is a real child.	Ye mwana ddala.
I want to see something very soon.	Njagala okulaba ekintu mu bbanga ttono ddala.
You are a friend.	Oli wa mukwano.
Not even with this one.	Si bwe kiri ne ku kino.
He was the hope .	Ye yali essuubi .
More than that, it’s also dangerous.	Okusinga ekyo, era kya bulabe.
He could spend time with his girlfriend.	Yali asobola okumala obudde ne muganzi we.
It is a wonderful place to live.	Kifo kirungi nnyo okubeera.
I hope we go with him.	Nsuubira nti tugenda naye.
It can be good or bad.	Kiyinza okuba nga kirungi oba nga kibi.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
He said that was true.	Yagamba nti ekyo kituufu.
All of us except us, of course.	Ffenna okuggyako ffe, ddala.
Maybe we should read the book.	Mpozzi tusaanidde okusoma ekitabo ekyo.
The food was good .	Emmere yali nnungi .
To say the least .	Okugamba nti .
Back to when?.	Okudda ku ddi?.
We are both.	Ffembi tuli...
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
He has a younger brother.	Alina muto we.
But it is the case.	Naye bwe kiri.
You have a lot of money.	Olina ssente nnyingi.
Better hitting, maybe.	Okukuba obulungi, mpozzi.
He knew about everyone.	Yali amanyi ku buli muntu.
You're on to something .	Oli ku kintu .
Here he was safe.	Wano yali talina bulabe.
I know you can.	Nkimanyi nti osobola.
Like reading a book.	Nga okusoma ekitabo.
I can’t even do that now.	Ekyo sisobola na kukikola kati.
I knew he would anyway.	Nali nkimanyi nti mu ngeri yonna yandikoze.
All right, we’ll do that.	Kirungi, ekyo tujja kukikola.
Herein lies the complicated problem.	Wano we wali ekizibu ekizibu.
It’s not true.	Si kituufu.
But he didn’t need to, either.	Naye naye yali teyeetaaga, era.
However, that is what it is.	Kyokka ekyo kye kiri.
Very quickly, in fact.	Mangu nnyo, mu butuufu.
For three nights.	Okumala ekiro ssatu.
No one in the class speaks.	Tewali muntu yenna mu kibiina ayogera.
Like that’s exactly it.	Nga ekyo bwe kiri ddala.
Or almost all things.	Oba kumpi ebintu byonna.
But now, the problem.	Naye kati, ekizibu.
No, this is not the place for me.	Nedda, kino si kifo gyendi.
However, it will not work in this case.	Kyokka, tekijja kukola mu mbeera eno.
I guess we should be going.	Ntebereza nti tusaanidde okuba nga tugenda.
That’s where he was.	Awo we yali.
Nothing too complicated about it.	Tewali kintu kizibu nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
It 's so bad	Kibi nnyo .
But he had no time for it.	Naye yali talina budde bwa kukikola.
He does it a lot.	Akikola nnyo.
This is what I want.	Kino kye njagala.
They were into what they were into.	Baali mu bye baali mu.
Not everyone, for everyone.	Si buli muntu, ku buli muntu.
But you are powerless.	Naye ggwe tolina maanyi.
But, the beautiful one.	Naye, omulungi.
He would love this.	Kino yandiyagadde nnyo.
In this way, in that way.	Mu ngeri eno, mu ngeri eyo.
He is now very strong.	Kati wa maanyi nnyo.
Maybe he doesn’t need to know.	Mpozzi nga teyeetaaga kumanya.
There are so many things in the house.	Mu nnyumba mulimu ebintu bingi nnyo.
All in good time.	Byonna mu budde obulungi.
That’s not much at all for me.	Ebyo si bingi n’akatono gyendi.
Not together, by any means.	Si wamu, mu ngeri yonna.
I have a job.	Nnina omulimu.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
No one knows for sure.	Tewali amanyi mu butuufu.
He really, really wants someone.	Mazima ddala, ddala ayagala omuntu.
he was curious.	yali ayagala okumanya.
This is not who we are.	Kino si kye tuli.
I knew that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi.
But this was ancient.	Naye kino kyali kya dda.
I was lucky.	Nali wa mukisa.
Of course, there is no easy answer to that.	Kya lwatu nti tewali kyangu kya kuddamu ku ekyo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
It’s my time.	Kye kiseera kyange.
I’m not entirely sure.	Sikakasa ddala.
We have no plans.	Tetulina nteekateeka yonna.
I think that this would be normal.	Ndowooza nti kino kyandibadde kya bulijjo.
Now he was beautiful.	Kati yali mulungi.
How lucky I am for me.	Nga ndi wa mukisa gyendi.
And he didn’t have a girlfriend.	Era yali talina muganzi.
But it’s not realistic.	Naye si kya ddala.
That was what he had to do.	Ekyo kye yali alina okukola.
Maybe it was like that.	Mpozzi nga bwe kyali.
Maybe he doesn’t know who.	Mpozzi nga tamanyi ani.
But this is very simple.	Naye kino kyangu nnyo.
But here's all we have now.	Naye wano byonna bye tulina kati.
You have to drive.	Olina okuvuga.
That’s all you want to do.	Ekyo kyokka ky’oyagala okukola.
I’m so alone here, you know.	Nze wano ndi nzekka nnyo, omanyi.
You’re not, you know.	Ggwe toli, omanyi.
I was friendly to everyone.	Nnali wa mukwano eri buli muntu.
Always at night.	Bulijjo ekiro.
He has his reasons.	Alina ensonga ze.
It’s not good for me.	Si kirungi gyendi.
I was that guy.	Nze nali ggaayi oyo.
Will have to do it now.	Ajja kuba alina okukikola kati.
That’s a great movie.	Eyo firimu nnungi nnyo.
Everyone is their own person.	Buli muntu muntu we.
Actually my best friend.	Mu butuufu mukwano gwange asinga.
It may or may not be the truth.	Kiyinza okuba nga kye kituufu oba nga si kye kituufu.
Not now and maybe not always.	Si kati era mpozzi si bulijjo.
This is indeed a beautiful thing.	Mazima ddala kino kintu kirungi nnyo.
I will make a point of it.	Nja kukikola ensonga.
It would only be a matter of time.	Kyandibadde nsonga ya kiseera kyokka.
He can't say anything but that.	Tasobola kwogera kintu kyonna okuggyako ekyo.
But not here.	Naye si wano.
You are so beautiful.	Oli mulungi nnyo.
No one wants to talk.	Tewali ayagala kwogera.
He had a feeling it wasn’t his business.	Yalina endowooza nti si nsonga ye.
Soon this house came into view.	Mu bbanga ttono ennyumba eno yajja mu maaso.
Now you can go.	Kati osobola okugenda.
That’s not a problem for me.	Ekyo si kizibu gyendi.
It has to be me.	Alina okuba nze.
No one knows we’re here.	Tewali amanyi nti tuli wano.
I want everything to be right.	Njagala buli kimu kituufu.
Perhaps you are one.	Oboolyawo oli omu.
It certainly is.	Mazima ddala bwe kiri.
I don't know .	Simanyi .
But he spoke the truth.	Naye yayogera mazima.
Honestly, no one needs to know.	Mu butuufu, tewali muntu yenna yeetaaga kumanya.
I don’t know why.	Simanyi lwaki.
You’re afraid he might see things my way.	Otya nti ayinza okulaba ebintu mu ngeri yange.
Perhaps it could be.	Oboolyawo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
He loved to swim.	Yali ayagala nnyo okuwuga.
I wanted to be like him.	Nnali njagala kubeera nga ye.
It was pretty intense.	Yali nnungi nnyo nga ya maanyi.
He can’t get enough.	Tasobola kufuna kumala.
He did just that.	Yakola bw’atyo.
And then we’ll talk.	Era awo tujja kwogera.
I wasn’t sure.	Nnali sikakasa.
But this is not easy for a person.	Naye kino si kyangu eri omuntu.
But not everything.	Kyokka si buli kimu.
And that’s not all.	Era ekyo si kye kyokka.
What a lot of it.	Nga bingi.
Not on time, anyway.	Si mu budde, mu ngeri yonna.
Now, however, it was worse.	Kyokka kati kyali kibi nnyo.
He still doesn’t know why he did what he did.	N’okutuusa kati tamanyi lwaki yakola kye yakola.
This may be the same.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kye kimu.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
Everyone wants their money.	Buli muntu ayagala ssente ze.
That’s quick.	Ekyo kya mangu.
I couldn’t be happier.	Nnali siyinza kuba musanyufu okusinga ekyo.
Everyone has to be their own person.	Buli muntu alina okuba omuntu we.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo.
He is in no mood to go anywhere.	Tali mu mbeera ya kugenda yonna.
Tonight was a great one.	Ekiro kya leero kyali kikulu nnyo.
I think it’s absolutely true.	Ndowooza nti kituufu ddala.
Maybe something me.	Mpozzi ekintu nze.
Everyone is friendly with everyone else.	Buli muntu wa mukwano ne buli muntu omulala.
And he did it.	Era yakikola.
You don’t have to go.	Tolina kugenda.
That was all he had.	Ekyo kyokka kye yalina.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
In this way one can do whatever one wants.	Mu ngeri eno omuntu asobola okukola kyonna ky’ayagala.
Everyone knew at the time there was a problem.	Buli omu yali akimanyi mu kiseera ekyo nga waliwo ekizibu.
And he does it himself.	Era ye kennyini akikola.
I don’t want to be there anymore.	Saagala kuddamu kubeerawo.
Now you are mine.	Kati ggwe oli wange.
I have been working hard.	Mbadde nkola nnyo.
It will be good if you do the same.	Kijja kuba kirungi singa naawe okola ekintu kye kimu.
Like, exactly like him.	Nga, ddala nga ye.
It’s hard for me.	Kizibu gyendi.
He was willing to do this himself.	Kino yali mwetegefu okukola ye kennyini.
He wanted to go with her.	Yali ayagala kugenda naye.
Good to have you here.	Kirungi okubeera naawe wano.
You’re so young.	Oli muto nnyo.
I’ve got a picture of him.	Nfunye ekifaananyi kye.
But in reality, this is not true.	Naye mu butuufu, kino si kituufu.
Really with a chance.	Ddala nga waliwo omukisa.
I thought hard about what he asked.	Nnalowooza nnyo ku bye yabuuza.
I'm sure of it.	Nze nkakasa.
I was very happy with this.	Kino nnali musanyufu nnyo.
That's the whole point.	Eyo y'ensonga yonna.
No one had it.	Tewali muntu yenna yalina.
He doesn’t have a car.	Talina mmotoka.
He was actually quite interested.	Mu butuufu yali ayagala nnyo.
He did go without a hitch.	Kye yakola yagenda nga talina buzibu bwonna.
Not who he was.	Si ani gwe yali.
He did all he could.	Yakola kyonna kye yali asobola.
In fact, he did that too.	Mu butuufu, ekyo naye yakikola.
But he was hardly in a mood to talk.	Naye yali talina nnyo mbeera ya kwogera.
I do the exact same thing.	Nze nkola ekintu kye kimu ddala.
You have to go!' 	Olina okugenda!’.
Or as good as it was going to get.	Oba nga kirungi nga bwe kyali kigenda okufuna.
You think quickly.	Olowooza mangu.
Hungry as we are.	Enjala nga bwe tuli.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
It’s not about anything.	Si kya kintu kyonna.
I was very, very nervous.	Nali ntya nnyo, nga ntya nnyo.
He was so close to her now.	Yali kumpi nnyo naye kati.
But it is nowhere to be seen.	Naye tewali we kirabika.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
We’re all fine.	Ffenna tuli bulungi.
Who knows what will happen.	Ani amanyi ekigenda okubaawo.
No one expects to wait long ahead.	Tewali asuubira kulinda bbanga ddene mu maaso.
We have a lot of hope.	Tulina essuubi ddene.
We were, too.	Naffe twali.
That’s how he was.	Bw’atyo bwe yali.
Not like here.	Si nga wano.
None of this had to happen.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kyalina kubaawo.
He knew everything .	Yali amanyi buli kimu .
He wants to be a good person.	Ayagala kubeera muntu mulungi.
And now he is very happy.	Era kati musanyufu nnyo.
But he is with me.	Naye ali nange.
Everyone was going.	Buli omu yali agenda.
You have no idea.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
That is actually true.	Mu butuufu ekyo kituufu.
He would always be with her.	Bulijjo yandibadde naye.
I have everything.	Nnina buli kimu.
He didn’t think he would.	Yali talowooza nti ajja kukikola.
I can barely speak.	Nsobola bulungi okwogera.
This is unusual for me.	Kino si kya bulijjo gyendi.
She loved dogs.	Yali ayagala nnyo embwa.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
Much more than his brother.	Okusinga nnyo muganda we.
While he can hit, he is not a serious threat there.	Wadde asobola okukuba, si wa bulabe bwa maanyi eyo.
In a sense, this is true.	Mu ngeri emu, kino kituufu.
I was very aware of that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi nnyo.
But he had tonight.	Naye yalina ekiro kino.
But now, thinking about it .	Naye kati, okulowooza ku nsonga eyo .
Maybe that's me.	Mpozzi oyo nze.
Of course, the problem.	Kya lwatu, ekizibu.
You are the strongest of us.	Ggwe asinga amaanyi mu ffe.
This is true for everyone.	Kino kituufu eri buli muntu.
There is no hurry to do.	Tewali bwangu kukola.
His attitude was one of practical thinking.	Endowooza ye yali ya ndowooza ya nkola.
He could have done this alone.	Kino yandibadde asobola okukikola yekka.
It would be difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu.
In fact it was all he was doing.	Mu butuufu byonna bye yali akola.
He wants everyone to do things his way, just like him.	Ayagala buli muntu akole ebintu mu ngeri ye, nga ye.
. . . .	.
No one went with him.	Tewali yagenda naye.
Then the whole week he wasn't going to.	Awo wiiki yonna yali tagenda ku...
That’s what he would do.	Ekyo kye yandikoze.
I don’t care about the waiting time.	Sifaayo ku budde bwa kulinda.
Tonight is a great one.	Ekiro kya leero kikulu nnyo.
Too many hours.	Ssaawa nnyingi nnyo.
He was absolutely.	Yali ddala.
If only he knew.	Singa yali amanyi kyokka.
I knew so much.	Nali mmanyi bingi nnyo.
Now he is my best friend.	Kati ye mukwano gwange ennyo.
It looks like it will be great.	Kirabika kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
I want it here too.	Njagala wano nange.
Now I don't know	Kati simanyi .
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
There is nothing to say.	Tewali kya kwogera.
He went to work on time.	Yagenda ku mulimu mu budde.
I don’t care about this.	Sifaayo ku nsonga eno.
A little busy.	Katono nga bbize.
We have no issue with that at all.	Ekyo tetulina nsonga yonna n’akatono.
Everyone says the same thing.	Buli omu ayogera ekintu kye kimu.
But he says so.	Naye ayogera bw’atyo.
. . . .	.
What was he thinking? 	Kiki kye yali alowooza?
Maybe it’s me.	Mpozzi nga nze.
He is fine at the moment.	Ali bulungi mu kiseera kino.
No one knew anything about it.	Tewali yali amanyi kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
You’re going to be fine.	Ogenda kuba bulungi.
He didn’t know where or why.	Yali tamanyi wa oba lwaki.
Hit, hit, hit.	Okukuba, okukuba, okukuba.
It’s really awful.	Ddala kibi nnyo.
He was willing to do it.	Yali mwetegefu okukikola.
I really don’t want to do anything but this.	Mazima ddala saagala kukola kintu kyonna okuggyako kino.
I love to eat.	Njagala nnyo okulya.
I wanted to go to jail.	Nnali njagala kugenda mu kkomera.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
Not today they are not.	Si leero si bwe bali.
But in reality it is not.	Naye mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
He won’t talk.	Tajja kwogera.
He was a nice guy.	Yali ggaayi mulungi.
It looks like this could indeed be an issue.	Kirabika kino ddala kiyinza okuba ensonga.
But this would never happen, he knew.	Naye kino tekijja kubaawo, yali akimanyi.
I thought he was very lucky.	Nalowooza nti wa mukisa nnyo.
That’s the problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu.
I really hope you might as well.	Nsuubira ddala nti oyinza nga bwe kiri.
You have to read.	Olina okusoma.
It can last up to three weeks.	Kiyinza okumala wiiki ssatu.
He has high hopes.	Alina essuubi ddene.
It’s hard to say.	Kizibu okwogera.
We will probably win.	Oboolyawo tujja kuwangula.
It’s a man’s job.	Gwe mulimu gwa musajja.
Not really exactly.	Si ddala ddala.
And even then.	Era ne mu kiseera ekyo.
There is a reason you are here.	Waliwo ensonga lwaki oli wano.
I am alone here today.	Nze wano ndi nzekka leero.
And you need to know why.	Era olina okumanya lwaki.
He always does it.	Bulijjo akikola.
We’re going to be with him.	Tugenda kubeera naye.
She was so beautiful, almost beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo, kumpi nga mulungi.
But, he was.	Naye, yali.
It’s not too difficult.	Si kizibu nnyo.
Eating well.	Okulya obulungi.
It’s the same with movies.	Kye kimu ne firimu.
At this point we weren’t even friends.	Mu kiseera kino twali tetulina wadde ba mukwano.
He wasn’t like that at all.	Yali si bwe yali n’akatono.
It seems simple to me.	Kirabika nga kyangu gyendi.
No one knows.	Tewali muntu yenna amanyi.
I wonder if that’s true.	Nze nneebuuza oba ekyo kituufu.
I know he wasn’t.	Nkimanyi nti si bwe yali.
He has no issue with me.	Talina nsonga gyendi.
House this week.	Ennyumba wiiki eno.
Maybe for everyday.	Mpozzi ku lwa bulijjo.
And he works hard.	Era akola nnyo.
He couldn’t do that.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
Perhaps it was .	Oboolyawo bwe kyali .
It’s not a job.	Si mulimu.
And it really doesn’t matter.	Era ddala si kikulu.
That’s what everyone thought.	Bw’atyo buli omu bwe yali alowooza.
He made a plan.	Yakola enteekateeka.
Just a moment .	Akaseera katono ddala .
No one really has any idea.	Mu butuufu tewali muntu yenna alina kirowoozo kyonna.
I won’t do that here.	Ekyo sijja kukikola wano.
No one knew what.	Tewali yali amanyi ki.
. . . .	.
Not in your case.	Si mu mbeera yo.
This will be really good.	Kino kijja kuba kirungi ddala.
He knows where they are.	Amanyi gye bali.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
No one knew what it was.	Tewali yali amanyi kye kyali.
Like my father.	Nga taata wange.
I'm in no hurry right now.	Sirina bwangu bwonna mu kiseera kino.
It was a beautiful sight.	Kyali kirabika bulungi.
You can’t do anything yourself.	Ggwe kennyini tosobola kukola kintu kyonna.
I have no idea who my father was.	Sirina kye mmanyi taata wange yali ani.
But he was her friend.	Naye yali mukwano gwe.
I need help, here.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi, wano.
But that wasn’t what he wanted now.	Naye ekyo si kye yali ayagala kati.
This was good for me.	Kino kyali kirungi gyendi.
And who he was.	Era ani gwe yali.
One doesn’t have one.	Omu talina emu.
He prefers to be alone.	Asinga kwagala kubeera yekka.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
It was a quick thing.	Kyali kintu kya mangu.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
It’s a matter of time.	Ensonga ya budde.
It's here and there.	Kiri wano ne wano.
I’m working, too.	Nze nange nkola.
But he may be enough.	Naye ayinza okumala.
He can’t be like that.	Tayinza kuba bw’atyo.
He couldn’t do this.	Kino yali tasobola kukikola.
I’m not going to eat.	Sigenda mu kulya.
That’s how he was doing.	Bw’atyo bwe yali akola.
But that’s not the case right now.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri mu kiseera kino.
We will be able to help.	Tujja kusobola okuyamba.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I hope you can do it too.	Nsuubira nti naawe osobola okukikola.
Like anything, they are and they are not.	Nga ekintu kyonna, bali era si bwe bali.
And you are with him.	Era naawe oli naye.
I think that goes with you.	Ndowooza ekyo kigenda naawe.
We're going there.	Tugenda eyo.
I wonder if this book is ordinary.	Nze nneebuuza oba ekitabo kino kya bulijjo.
A person in knowledge.	Omuntu mu kumanya.
I’ve mostly been able to.	Nze okusinga mbadde nsobola.
It is a very good way.	Ye ngeri nnungi nnyo.
He could hardly wait.	Yali tasobola bulungi kulinda.
That was it, that was it.	Ekyo kyali, ekyo kye kyali.
I have to think.	Nnina okulowooza.
One like me.	Omu nga nze.
I have to talk to him.	Nnina okwogera naye.
You’re too good for that guy.	Oli mulungi nnyo eri ggaayi oyo.
Certainly not the way it is now.	Mazima ddala si ngeri gye kiri kati.
Here, this can help.	Wano, kino kiyinza okuyamba.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka, kino si kituufu.
But that's not him even then.	Naye ekyo si ye wadde awo.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
He wanted to say.	Yali ayagala okugamba nti.
He was the best, and he knew it.	Ye yali asinga obulungi, era yali akimanyi.
He needs to talk and now.	Yeetaaga okwogera era kati.
I know your point of view.	Nze mmanyi endowooza yo.
Now he wasn’t.	Kati yali si bwe yali.
I don’t want to know.	Saagala kumanya.
He was much stronger than her.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo okusinga ye.
This is the same for a person.	Kino kye kimu eri omuntu.
Nothing was any good.	Tewali kyali kirungi kyonna.
But probably not all of us.	Naye oboolyawo si ffenna.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka kino si kituufu.
There really is.	Ddala waliwo.
And when .	Era ddi .
My opinion is that it is happening.	Endowooza yange eri nti kigenda mu maaso.
He had to do it now.	Yalina okukikola kati.
Now it’s true.	Kati kituufu.
In no way could I do anything about it.	Mu ngeri yonna nnali sisobola kukikola kintu kyonna.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
Nothing better than home.	Tewali kintu kirungi okuggyako awaka.
He knew he wouldn't.	Yali akimanyi nti tajja kukikola.
Now we have a destination.	Kati tulina we tugenda.
He is a dangerous person.	Ye muntu wa bulabe.
He might do that tonight.	Ayinza okukola ekyo ekiro kino.
Nothing urgent.	Tewali kintu kya mangu.
Anything you want can happen there.	Ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala kiyinza okubaawo eyo.
Except the one in front.	Okuggyako eyo eri mu maaso.
I just hope we never have to happen again.	Nsuubira kyokka nti tetulina kuddamu kubaawo.
No continuity, either.	Tewali kugenda mu maaso, era.
That, of course, is the idea.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kye kirowoozo.
I could have done it.	Nnali nsobola okukikola.
I won’t stay long.	Sijja kumala bbanga ddene.
That he was friendly.	Nti yali wa mukwano.
Everyone loves to win.	Buli muntu ayagala nnyo okuwangula.
Back in town soon.	Okudda mu kibuga mu bbanga ttono.
But that’s not the point here.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga wano.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
I can’t drive a car.	Sisobola kuvuga mmotoka.
I think everyone wants a good job.	Ndowooza buli muntu ayagala omulimu mulungi.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
Everything was very difficult.	Buli kimu kyali kizibu nnyo.
We’ll see about that.	Tujja kulaba ku nsonga eyo.
He wasn’t like that .	Yali si bwe yali .
But he is not happy.	Naye si musanyufu.
Only you can do it.	Ggwe wekka asobola okukikola.
He couldn’t do this.	Kino yali tasobola kukikola.
Good to talk to you again.	Kirungi okuddamu okwogera naawe.
And in many ways, it’s very true as well.	Era mu ngeri nnyingi, kituufu nnyo era.
Since it is normal.	Okuva bwe kiri nti kya bulijjo.
I don’t know what could happen here.	Simanyi kiyinza kubaawo wano.
We'll wait.	Tujja kulinda.
You definitely shouldn’t do this.	Mazima ddala kino tolina kukikola.
I feel like it was.	Mpulira nga bwe kyali.
He must have had it.	Ateekwa okuba nga yalina.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
I am a good man.	Ndi musajja mulungi.
I'm not entirely sure about it.	Sikakasa ddala ku nsonga eyo.
It may be that	Kiyinza okuba nga .
My father was like that.	Taata yali bw’atyo.
Everyone got what they wanted.	Buli omu yafuna kye yali ayagala.
Not for anyone.	Si lwa muntu yenna.
It is very, very important.	Kikulu nnyo nnyo.
This is an opportune time.	Kino kiseera kya mukisa.
You know that as well as anyone else.	Ekyo okimanyi bulungi nga omuntu omulala yenna.
I'm going to do it.	Ngenda kukikola.
This was not what he expected at all.	Kino si kye yali asuubira n’akatono.
Everything was fine, everything was normal.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi, buli kimu kyali kya bulijjo.
And no one knows it’s there.	Era tewali amanyi nti kiri awo.
And it is very true.	Era kituufu nnyo.
Just one night.	Ekiro kimu kyokka.
It is very, very important.	Kikulu nnyo nnyo.
That is actually what it is.	Mu butuufu ekyo kye kiri.
That’s a real thing.	Ekyo kya ddala.
Or in the last week.	Oba mu wiiki ewedde.
This is why .	Eno y’ensonga lwaki .
This is a bad thing.	Kino kibi.
Probably not immediately.	Oboolyawo si mangu ddala.
And this could be for me, too.	Era kino kiyinza okuba gyendi, nange.
However, he had one week.	Kyokka yalina wiiki emu.
You'll have to watch.	Ojja kuba olina okulaba.
That’s the person.	Oyo ye muntu oyo.
I'll stay here.	Nja kusigala wano.
It doesn’t matter .	Si kikulu .
For one thing.	Ku kintu kimu.
He was here now.	Yali wano kati.
I have only one problem.	Nnina ekizibu kimu kyokka.
He must have been into something.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali mu kintu.
He was neither young nor pretty.	Yali si muto wadde mulungi.
Apparently it wasn’t.	Kirabika si bwe kyali.
He probably went alone.	Oboolyawo yagenda yekka.
Every man except himself.	Buli musajja okuggyako ye.
I had nothing to say about that.	Ekyo nnali sirina kye nnyinza kwogera.
But he will come.	Naye ajja kujja.
You can go back to work now.	Osobola okudda ku mulimu kati.
You know he will.	Omanyi nti ajja kukikola.
But, of course, he would.	Naye, kya lwatu, yandikoze.
I thought he thought we were ahead.	Nnalowooza nti yali alowooza nti twali mu maaso.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
But no one has to know.	Naye tewali muntu yenna alina kumanya.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
I love it though.	Njagala nnyo wadde.
. . . .	.
Maybe it was like he was.	Mpozzi nga bwe yali.
He hoped it would stay that way.	Yalina essuubi nti kijja kusigala nga bwe kiri.
But he was telling the truth.	Naye yali ayogera mazima.
At that point it was time to go anyway.	Mu kiseera ekyo kyali kiseera kya kugenda mu ngeri yonna.
Do you want to move on?.	Oyagala kugenda mu maaso?.
Everything is easy.	Buli kimu kyangu.
In the car, it would work fine.	Mu mmotoka, yandikoze bulungi.
But that would be a bad answer.	Naye ekyo kyandibadde kya kuddamu kibi.
One went ahead.	Omu yagenda mu maaso.
I have to do it.	Nnina okukikola.
You have one week.	Olina wiiki emu.
That’s a problem right now.	Ekyo kizibu mu kiseera kino.
He looks sick.	Alabika mulwadde.
And it’s there.	Era kiri awo.
What should we do.	Kiki kye tusaanidde okukola.
That had to be what he did.	Ekyo kyalina okuba nga kye yakola.
Where that can all come from.	Ekyo kyonna gye kiyinza okuva.
And at the time, that was a very serious thing.	Era mu kiseera ekyo, ekyo kyali kintu kya maanyi nnyo.
He couldn’t.	Yali tasobola.
No one was talking.	Tewali yali ayogera.
He can definitely do it.	Asobola okukikola ddala.
Everyone wanted to work with him.	Buli omu yali ayagala okukola naye.
No, in no way was I.	Nedda, mu ngeri yonna gye nnali.
However, that is an idea.	Kyokka, ekyo kirowoozo.
He couldn't do this with her here.	Kino yali tasobola kukikola naye wano.
It’s good to know that it is.	Kirungi okumanya nti bwe kiri.
I love being with him .	Njagala nnyo okubeera naye .
Really good .	Ddala kirungi .
He is in the issue.	Ye wa mu nsonga.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
But he is not well.	Naye ye tali bulungi.
You are a good man.	Oli musajja mulungi.
No' while in this state.	Nedda' nga ali mu mbeera eno.
Not so much for me.	Si nnyo nnyo gyendi.
This is a complex problem.	Kino kizibu kizibu.
He knew how important this was.	Yali akimanyi nti kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
Maybe, he's asleep.	Mpozzi, yeebase.
He started living with us.	Yatandika okubeera naffe.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
I guess he did.	Ntebereza nti yakikola.
I have been alone for so long.	Mbadde nzekka okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
He can move on.	Asobola okugenda mu maaso.
I doubt anyone was.	Nbuusabuusa nti waliwo omuntu yenna bwe yali.
He didn’t know if it was true.	Yali tamanyi oba kituufu.
Buying a house.	Okugula ennyumba.
But he seemed like that.	Naye yalabika ng’ekyo.
I feel close to you already.	Mpulira nga ndi kumpi naawe dda.
And this would be .	Era kino kyandibadde .
Maybe not .	Mpozzi nga si bwe kiri .
You’re good now.	Oli mulungi kati.
It’s what everyone needed.	Kye buli muntu kye yali yeetaaga.
Which will get to the point.	Ekigenda okutuuka ku nsonga.
That’s what’s important right now.	Ekyo kye kikulu mu kiseera kino.
But he's beautiful.	Naye mulungi.
But then! 	Naye awo!
I really hope you will.	Nsuubira ddala nti ojja kukikola.
You have to go with him.	Olina okugenda naye.
But everyone knows that now.	Naye ekyo buli omu akimanyi kati.
It’s not luck.	Si mukisa.
Not but close enough.	Si naye kumpi nnyo.
I love getting here.	Njagala nnyo okutuuka wano.
Not without space.	Si nga tolina kifo.
A little while ago.	Akaseera katono emabega.
We had no idea who it was.	Twali tetulina kirowoozo kyonna ku ani.
No really, he did.	Nedda ddala, bwe yakola.
I think he is very good at his job.	Ndowooza mulungi nnyo mu mulimu gwe.
I love being in this situation.	Njagala nnyo okubeera mu mbeera eno.
You should definitely go.	Mazima ddala olina okugenda.
That’s just not me.	Ekyo kyokka si nze.
I always have and probably always will.	Bulijjo nnina era oboolyawo bulijjo nja kuba.
I have no idea how that is.	Sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri ekyo gye kiri.
No one knew this.	Kino tewali yali akimanyi.
It doesn’t matter here.	Wano si kikulu.
Maybe he should .	Mpozzi yandibadde .
In fact, they are not.	Mu butuufu, si bwe bali.
I’ll be there right now.	Nja kuba awo mu kiseera kino.
It was very dangerous for me.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo gyendi.
But, he couldn’t be comfortable.	Naye, yali tasobola kubeera mu mbeera nnungi.
He needed to get home.	Yali yeetaaga okutuuka awaka.
And the reason he is, we are.	Era ensonga lwaki ali, tuli.
No one knows that.	Ekyo tewali akimanyi.
Just like my father.	Nga taata bwe kiri.
His house was coming together.	Ennyumba ye yali ejja wamu.
And that’s nothing.	Era ekyo si kintu kyonna.
But now it is.	Naye kati bwe kiri.
He felt comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi.
It was definitely there.	Mazima ddala kyali awo.
For a long time he was alone.	Okumala ebbanga ddene yali yekka.
But someone had to do those things.	Naye omuntu yalina okukola ebintu ebyo.
He had so much of that, he knew.	Yalina bingi nnyo ku ebyo, yali akimanyi.
I love being me.	Njagala nnyo okubeera nze.
That is what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
He didn’t want a child.	Yali tayagala mwana.
Working hard here.	Okukola ennyo wano.
That's what he wants.	Ekyo ky'ayagala.
But today we are fine.	Naye leero tuli bulungi.
Each of us.	Buli omu ku ffe.
He had a job he loved.	Yalina omulimu gwe yali ayagala ennyo.
It’s important to know.	Kikulu okumanya.
Here we were one and the same.	Wano twali kimu era kye kimu.
This will help.	Kino kijja kuyamba.
This I am not very good at this.	Kino siri mulungi nnyo mu kino.
You want to do this.	Kino oyagala kukikola.
As if there is a reason for something like this.	Nga bwe waliwo ensonga lwaki ekintu nga kino.
When you are completely alone.	Nga ggwe ali wekka ddala.
I know he will do it.	Nkimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
That would be my dad.	Oyo yandibadde taata wange.
I was here now.	Nze nali wano kati.
Or my food.	Oba emmere yange.
It was actually quite intimate.	Mu butuufu kyali kya mukwano nnyo.
I love it myself.	Nze kennyini njagala nnyo.
But it was just normal.	Naye kyali kya bulijjo kyokka.
It’s not just what he is.	Si ky’ali kyokka.
No one came to help .	Tewali yajja kuyamba .
He talks to her.	Ayogera naye.
You can do that in your car.	Ekyo osobola okukikola mu mmotoka yo.
But he was alone tonight.	Naye yali yekka ekiro kino.
Something is going on.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
She would be his wife.	Yandibadde mukyala we.
It was absolutely beautiful.	Kyali kirungi ddala.
He works hard for me.	Akola nnyo gyendi.
That’s not very good.	Ekyo si kirungi nnyo.
He said he didn’t think it wasn’t.	Yagambye nti talowooza nti si bwe kiri.
That was coming.	Ekyo kyali kijja.
That would be fine with me.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi gyendi.
I love that guy more than anything.	Ggaayi oyo njagala nnyo okusinga ekintu kyonna.
I want both of them.	Njagala bombi.
He was terrified.	Yali atya nnyo.
However, I didn’t care.	Kyokka nnali sifaayo.
And you know, it actually looks really good.	Era omanyi, mu butuufu kirabika bulungi ddala.
In your case.	Mu mbeera yo.
No one wanted to talk.	Tewali yali ayagala kwogera.
You can get it.	Osobola okufuna.
But for just a moment.	Naye okumala akaseera akaseera katono.
This thing will never happen.	Ekintu kino tekijja kubaawo.
You won’t see.	Tojja kulaba.
I know that.	Ekyo nkimanyi.
That's why there's no urgency.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tewali bwangu.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
It’s not an opinion or an opinion.	Si ndowooza oba ndowooza.
This is already a good start.	Eno yatandika dda bulungi.
He believed anything.	Yakkiriza ekintu kyonna.
He hasn’t been there yet.	Tannaba kubeerawo.
I'll just know.	Nja kumala kumanya.
We’re going to win.	Tugenda kuwangula.
This was not my problem.	Kino si kye kyali ekizibu kyange.
But in this case, they are.	Naye mu mbeera eno, bwe bali.
No one knows what he wants.	Tewali amanyi ky’ayagala.
But he will come to me.	Naye ajja kujja gyendi.
And it won’t happen.	Era tekijja kubaawo.
He talked to her for a long time.	Yayogera naye ebbanga ddene.
Now you are.	Kati ggwe oli.
It was about	Yali nga 100.
Don’t go to the police.	Togenda ku poliisi.
There is no reason.	Tewali nsonga yonna.
He has been very interested.	Abadde ayagala nnyo.
It’s a lot of money.	Kye ssente nnyingi nnyo.
You will certainly do it.	Mazima ddala ojja kukikola.
He's not a man.	Si musajja.
That will be good.	Ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
Reading was everything.	Okusoma kyali buli kimu.
It would be him.	Kyandibadde ye.
And he won’t go away.	Era tagenda kugenda.
But maybe it’s much simpler than that.	Naye mpozzi nga kyangu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He could do this.	Kino yali asobola okukikola.
No one would, either.	Tewali muntu yenna yandikoze, era.
He wants a child.	Ayagala mwana.
Someone like	Omuntu nga .
You find the time.	Osanga obudde.
Not mine, anyway.	Si yange, mu ngeri yonna.
My son, this is very good.	Mwana wange kino kirungi nnyo.
It’s hard to say.	Kizibu okwogera.
I was expecting this.	Kino nnali nsuubira.
He says he has no idea.	Agamba nti talina kirowoozo kyonna.
Good for you, bad for us.	Kirungi gyoli, kibi gye tuli.
It is a very serious issue.	Ensonga ya maanyi nnyo.
Which is the same thing.	Nga kye kimu.
What is that problem.	Kiki ekizibu ekyo.
I think he knows that too.	Ndowooza naye ekyo akimanyi.
He couldn’t believe what he saw.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza bye yalaba.
I thought that was pretty cool.	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I could just leave here.	Nnali nsobola okumala okuva wano.
You can’t make a place like this.	Tosobola kukola kifo nga kino.
He is with us.	Ali naffe.
We will be left with nothing.	Tujja kusigala nga tetulina kye tulina.
He was such a nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo bw’atyo.
It’s not a problem, really.	Si kizibu, ddala.
He has so much for me.	Alina bingi nnyo gyendi.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
I love talking to him.	Njagala nnyo okwogera naye.
He had a friend.	Yalina mukwano gwe.
He didn’t want to know anything about his son.	Yali tayagala kumanya kintu kyonna ku mwana we.
He doesn't know what to do.	Tamanyi kya kukola.
But none of her.	Naye tewali ku ye.
He has to leave that place.	Alina okuva mu kifo ekyo.
He will eat anything.	Ajja kulya ekintu kyonna.
He didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala.
Now he has no eyes for anyone.	Kati talina maaso ku muntu yenna.
You can do almost anything.	Osobola okukola kumpi ekintu kyonna.
But there was nothing.	Naye nga tewali kintu kyonna.
As it is very difficult.	Nga bwe kiri ekizibu ennyo.
I'll go now, he thought.	Nja kugenda kati, bwe yalowooza.
He couldn’t believe his good fortune.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza mukisa gwe omulungi.
This is more real than that.	Kino kya ddala okusinga ekyo.
He hadn’t answered.	Yali tannaba kuddamu.
No, it was definitely indoors.	Nedda, mazima ddala kyali mu nnyumba.
I didn’t have it.	Nze nali sirina.
Or maybe he wasn’t.	Oba oboolyawo nga si bwe yali.
The point is to do it really well.	Ensonga eri nti okukikola obulungi ddala.
He was always alone.	Bulijjo yali yekka.
It could be anything.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
He is in danger here.	Ali mu bulabe wano.
He was asleep.	Yali yeebase.
Don’t go with me.	Togenda nange.
We will get back to you soon!.	Tujja kuddamu amangu ddala!.
I love to swim.	Njagala nnyo okuwuga.
He is really good.	Ye mulungi ddala.
It’s good this way.	Kirungi mu ngeri eno.
I want to know.	Njagala kumanya.
Anything, a car.	Ekintu kyonna, mmotoka.
I have a lot of it.	Nnina bingi.
And, well, that's it.	Era, bulungi, ekyo kye kiri.
It's not something like that.	Si kintu ng'ekyo.
He has his own job.	Alina omulimu gwe.
He obviously couldn’t.	Kya lwatu yali tasobola.
Not today, not next week.	Si leero, si wiiki ejja.
I love driving everything.	Njagala nnyo okuvuga buli kimu.
I love my car.	Njagala nnyo mmotoka yange.
Hope agreed to work.	Essuubi yakkiriza okukola.
I have to call someone.	Nnina okukuba omuntu essimu.
That’s what was going on.	Ekyo kye kyali kigenda mu maaso.
I'm the one.	Nze ye.
I’m just like any other guy.	Nze nga ggaayi omulala yenna.
I'm sorry, my boyfriend.	Nsonyiwa muganzi wange.
Reading, reading, reading.	Okusoma, okusoma, okusoma.
We have to get out of this situation.	Tulina okuva mu mbeera eno.
I want to talk to my father.	Njagala kwogera ne taata.
Then everything was right.	Awo buli kimu kyali kituufu.
This is definitely an option.	Eno mazima ddala nkola.
No, he cannot	Nedda, tasobola .
He’s not going to do it.	Tagenda kukikola.
Now he is ready.	Kati mwetegefu.
He did it anyway.	Yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
He felt a little better.	Yawulira bulungi katono.
He didn’t really want to.	Mu butuufu yali tayagala.
But it was mine.	Naye kyali kyange.
You, of course, know that.	Ggwe, kya lwatu, ekyo okimanyi.
Then there is no waiting.	Awo tewali kulinda.
And it could be me.	Era kiyinza okuba nga nze.
It will be soon enough.	Kijja kuba mu bbanga ttono.
He had a lot of money.	Yalina ssente nnyingi nnyo.
The problem is here.	Obuzibu buli wano.
He’s going to get better.	Agenda kufuna bulungi.
This will be harmful to your dog in many ways.	Kino kijja kuba kya bulabe eri embwa yo mu ngeri nnyingi.
No, last week, actually.	Nedda, wiiki ewedde, mu butuufu.
You don’t have to say one thing at a time.	Tolina kwogera kintu kimu kimu.
I don’t know how to answer.	Simanyi ngeri gye nnyinza kuddamu.
He knew he wouldn't.	Yali akimanyi nti tajja kukikola.
No one knows what might happen.	Tewali amanyi kiyinza kubaawo.
All the stuff.	Ebintu byonna.
He's there.	Ali eyo.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I was to see that one over the weekend.	Oyo nnali wa kulaba ku wiikendi.
It will never happen again.	Tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
It won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo.
On how it’s proceeding.	Ku ngeri gye kigenda mu maaso.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
And it won’t matter to them.	Era tekijja kuba kikulu gye bali.
He knew he could do it better.	Yali akimanyi nti asobola okukikola obulungi.
And he was, too.	Era naye yali, naye.
I want a safe home.	Njagala awaka nga talina bulabe.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
I'll see what happens.	Nja kulaba ekigenda okubaawo.
He goes to jail.	Agenda mu kkomera.
He's nearby.	Ali kumpi awo.
You won’t, you won’t.	Tojja kukikola, tojja kukikola.
You know something is going on.	Omanyi waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
I always wanted to win.	Bulijjo nnali njagala kuwangula.
I am truly sorry about this.	Mazima ddala nsonyiwa ku nsonga eno.
I like to work hard.	Njagala nnyo okukola ennyo.
But he didn’t know where.	Naye yali tamanyi wa.
It would be very difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
He actually does this.	Mu butuufu kino akikola.
Good for that.	Kirungi ku ekyo.
Not all of them.	Si byonna.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ekyo si kibi.
Not everyone can do that.	Ekyo si buli muntu nti asobola okukikola.
You’re in trouble.	Oli mu buzibu.
But that’s not entirely true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu ddala.
This movie is great.	Firimu eno nnungi nnyo.
You don’t have a party.	Tolina mbaga.
He came to me.	Yajja gye ndi.
Maybe it was.	Mpozzi bwe kyali.
Same with my father now.	Kye kimu ne taata kati.
I am alone too.	Nange ndi nzekka.
Something my wife likes too.	Ekintu ne mukyala wange ky’ayagala.
You don't know what you want, baby.	Tomanyi kyoyagala mwana wange.
I thought quickly.	Nalowooza mangu.
I just want you.	Nze njagala ggwe kyokka.
I am not myself and neither was he.	Nze kennyini siri era naye si bwe yali.
I am very happy.	Nze ndi musanyufu nnyo.
It really is as simple as that.	Ddala kyangu nga ekyo.
I have been thinking about this.	Kino mbadde ndowooza ku nsonga eno.
And it may be that you can.	Era kiyinza okuba nga osobola.
And he was.	Era yali.
This is the truth.	Kino kye kituufu.
Maybe it's the same.	Mpozzi nga bwe kiri.
I should have just waited.	Nnali nsaanidde kumala kulinda.
Everything about that.	Buli kimu ku ebyo.
He felt someone on his side.	Yawulira nga waliwo ku ludda lwe.
Not that it matters all that much.	Si nti kikulu nnyo ebyo byonna.
In fact, it wasn’t.	Mu butuufu, si bwe kyali.
He couldn’t have been happy.	Tayinza kuba nga yali musanyufu.
I have no idea why he thinks that.	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki alowooza bw’atyo.
No child is sick.	Tewali mwana mulwadde.
He cannot be real.	Tayinza kuba wa ddala.
It’s really bad down there.	Ddala kibi wansi awo.
It is very close.	Kiri kumpi nnyo.
I know it’s hard.	Nkimanyi nti kizibu.
It was everything.	Kyali buli kimu.
I was just hoping.	Nnali nsuubira kyokka.
But we are not alone.	Naye si ffe ffekka.
It’s not normal at all.	Si kya bulijjo n’akatono.
I’m not completely alone either.	Nange siri nzekka ddala.
I am strong.	Ndi wa maanyi.
Busy all morning.	Enkya yonna nga bbize.
He did very well.	Yakola bulungi nnyo.
I have nothing to do with him.	Sirina kye nkola ku ye.
But he knew he couldn't.	Naye yali akimanyi nti tasobola.
I’m not sure if this is good or bad.	Sikakasa oba kino kirungi oba kibi.
I’m in the hospital right now.	Nze ndi mu ddwaaliro mu kiseera kino.
But that wasn’t the point right now.	Naye eyo si ye yali ensonga mu kiseera kino.
Good or not good.	Kirungi oba si kirungi.
Here, right now.	Wano, mu kiseera kino.
I have to get home.	Nnina okutuuka awaka.
It’s none of my business.	Si nsonga yange yonna.
I can see everything.	Nsobola okulaba buli kimu.
He can help.	Asobola okuyamba.
I think this is absolutely true.	Ndowooza kino kituufu ddala.
But it is not	Naye nedda .
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika nga mulungi nnyo.
This would be a serious problem.	Kino kyandibadde kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
A little too quickly.	Katono nnyo mu bwangu.
There is so much food.	Emmere nnyingi nnyo.
You have these.	Bino olina.
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
He said fine, maybe he would.	Yagamba nti kirungi, mpozzi yandikoze.
We are here to help.	Tuli wano okuyamba.
make.	okukola.
It was so close.	Yali kumpi nnyo.
Eat! 	Okulya!
I know exactly where.	Nze mmanyi bulungi wa.
Not now, not that close.	Si kati, si bwe yali kumpi nnyo.
Dad said he thought that was true.	Taata yagamba nti ekyo yali alowooza nti kituufu.
No reason why he should, really.	Tewali nsonga lwaki yandibadde, ddala.
What he made money.	Kye yakola ssente.
And you certainly can.	Era mazima ddala osobola.
Not yourself at such a time.	Si ggwe kennyini mu kiseera ng’ekyo.
Now forward now that you should.	Kati mu maaso kati nti ggwe wandibadde.
Good to know.	Kirungi okumanya.
I know it better than anyone.	Nze nkimanyi okusinga omuntu yenna.
He knew so much.	Yali amanyi bingi nnyo.
I think it’s really important for us.	Ndowooza ddala kikulu gye tuli.
This seems very plausible.	Kino kirabika nga kituufu nnyo.
This is almost certainly a bad idea.	Kino kumpi ddala kirowoozo kibi.
You’re really on to something here.	Ddala oli ku kintu wano.
That’s not the point.	Eyo si y’ensonga.
And he was sick.	Era yali mulwadde.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali.
How beautiful you are.	Nga oli mulungi nnyo.
I know nothing about it.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
He should have had enough of this all.	Yandibadde amaze ku kino kyonna.
It will never be able to live there again.	Tekijja kuddamu kusobola kubeera eyo.
Maybe better though.	Mpozzi asinga wadde.
Just what he needed.	Kye yali yeetaaga kyokka.
That’s the easy one.	Ekyo kye kyangu.
He just didn’t have it.	Yali talina kyokka.
Actually quite a lot.	Mu butuufu bingi nnyo.
But he couldn’t.	Naye yali tasobola.
And this is the crux of my argument.	Era kino kye kikulu ennyo mu nsonga yange.
He seems like a really nice guy.	Alabika nga ggaayi omulungi ddala.
This is certainly true in many cases.	Kino mazima ddala kituufu mu mbeera nnyingi.
This is the point.	Eno y’ensonga.
It is your situation.	Ye mbeera yo.
And the job.	Era omulimu.
Not because of luck.	Si lwa mukisa.
He is a teacher.	Ye musomesa.
I couldn’t do that.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola.
And who knows, maybe it is.	Era ani amanyi, mpozzi bwe kiri.
I’m sure he was fine.	Nkakasa nti yali bulungi.
I just can’t believe it.	Nze sisobola kukkiriza kyokka.
But he was very happy.	Naye yali musanyufu nnyo.
If he had wanted to.	Singa yali ayagala.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
I don’t have time.	Sirina budde.
Doing these this week.	Okukola bino wiiki eno.
Not now, he thought.	Si kati, bwe yalowooza.
I have no idea.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
They are not	Si ba .
But he knew better.	Naye yali asinga okumanya.
He felt very comfortable.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo.
He had to do it.	Yali alina okukikola.
But he spoke to me.	Naye yayogera nange.
He was here right now.	Yali wano kati kati.
I could always be with you.	Bulijjo nnali nsobola okubeera naawe.
He is really, really well.	Ali bulungi ddala, bulungi ddala.
You do you.	Ggwe okola ggwe.
We don’t have to talk.	Tetulina kwogera.
They probably already are.	Oboolyawo baali dda.
No .	Nedda .
That’s a lot of money.	Eyo ssente nnyingi nnyo.
If we were alone.	Singa twali ffekka.
Or not at all, actually.	Oba si bwe kiri n’akatono, mu butuufu.
And it will work, that’s not a problem.	Era kijja kukola, ekyo si kizibu.
There’s stuff down there.	Waliwo ebintu wansi awo.
My point is that it is not.	Ensonga yange eri nti si bwe kiri.
The issue really is timing.	Ensonga ddala eri ku budde.
We need to do it, of course.	Twetaaga okukikola, ddala.
I live alone .	Mbeera nzekka .
You may not know how, why or what.	Oyinza okuba nga tomanyi ngeri ki, lwaki oba kiki.
He was very capable.	Yali asobola nnyo.
And it’s really good.	Era ddala kirungi.
And it’s not true.	Era si kituufu.
But that’s not me.	Naye ekyo si nze.
This is what could happen in a city like this.	Kino kye kyali kiyinza okubaawo mu kibuga nga kino.
He couldn’t do anything.	Yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
But that’s not what’s happening.	Naye ekyo si kye kigenda mu maaso.
Today, it seems normal.	Leero, kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
Indeed it is.	Mazima bwe kiri.
He came, or he was already here.	Yajja, oba yali wano dda.
Not his methods.	Si nkola ze.
I wonder, though, if eating would be easy.	Kyokka nneebuuza oba okulya kyandibadde kyangu.
Talking to his girlfriend.	Okwogera ne muganzi we.
It will be much easier.	Kijja kuba kyangu nnyo.
He was very lonely.	Yali yekka nnyo.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
It’s the same as me.	Kye kimu nga nze.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
He saw that it was really him.	Yalaba nga ddala ye.
He had nothing.	Yali talina ky’alina.
Not that he had to.	Si nti yalina okukikola.
I was just a kid myself.	Nze kennyini nnali mwana muto yekka.
But there was no time.	Naye nga tewali budde.
You apparently, can’t.	Ggwe kirabika, tosobola.
He doesn’t want to go home.	Tayagala kudda waka.
He won’t do it.	Tajja kukikola.
We always have access to.	Bulijjo tulina okutuuka ku.
I don’t really care why.	Sifaayo nnyo lwaki.
We’re all fine.	Ffenna tuli bulungi.
She wanted to go to school.	Yali ayagala kugenda ku ssomero.
No one had anything good to say about him.	Tewali yalina kirungi kya kwogera ku ye.
My, my, my.	Wange, wange, wange.
Everything is down.	Buli kimu kiri wansi.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Kya lwatu nti kino si bwe kiri.
It was a great idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
This is very simple on the concept.	Kino kyangu nnyo ku ndowooza.
I couldn’t see clearly anyway.	Nnali sisobola kulaba bulungi mu ngeri yonna.
He looked almost human.	Yalabika kumpi omuntu.
Or it’s not normal.	Oba si kya bulijjo.
I don’t want to be that person.	Saagala kubeera muntu oyo.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
He couldn’t do anything.	Yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna.
I couldn’t say much.	Nnali sisobola kwogera bingi.
That wasn’t the problem.	Ekyo si kye kyali ekizibu.
At this point, he didn't even have to talk.	Mu kiseera kino, yali talina wadde kwogera.
It was very easy to do.	Kyali kyangu nnyo okukola.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
We can’t be friends.	Tetusobola kuba ba mukwano.
You are in a romantic relationship.	Oli mu mukwano gwa mukwano.
But it was dangerous.	Naye kyali kya bulabe.
But we can’t at the moment.	Naye tetusobola mu kiseera kino.
The problem, as always, is money.	Obuzibu, nga bulijjo, ssente.
It was almost true.	Kumpi kyali kituufu.
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
I’m sure he will.	Nkakasa nti ajja kukikola.
Maybe he had something, maybe not.	Mpozzi yalina ky’alina, mpozzi nga si bwe kiri.
I'm fine.	Ndi bulungi.
That was pretty easy .	Ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo .
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
And he couldn’t have done it any better.	Era yali tayinza kukikola bulungi okusinga ekyo.
He is a good friend of mine.	Ye mukwano gwange omulungi.
They were in a huge hurry.	Baali mu bwangu bungi nnyo.
Actually it’s not me.	Mu butuufu si nze.
He can’t go on.	Tasobola kugenda mu maaso.
But you are a better man than I am.	Naye oli musajja asinga nze.
That would be my opinion.	Ekyo kyandibadde endowooza yange.
But he has a problem.	Naye alina ekizibu.
He was just that.	Yali bw’atyo yekka.
You are with him or with him.	Oli naye oba oli wamu naye.
This is not lucky.	Kino si kya mukisa.
And he probably did.	Era oboolyawo yakikola.
We have a lot to do tomorrow.	Tulina bingi bye tulina okukola enkya.
Nothing is important.	Tewali kintu kyonna kikulu.
He won’t do it.	Tajja kukikola.
But that’s for now, not always.	Naye ekyo kya kati, si bulijjo.
But the food is good.	Naye emmere nnungi.
It doesn’t really matter though.	Si kikulu nnyo wadde.
He knows this.	Kino akimanyi.
I can do it.	Nsobola okukikola.
Or to me.	Oba gyendi.
And he was now unhappy.	Era nga kati yali si musanyufu.
There is no one here.	Tewali muntu yenna wano.
It was really a moment.	Ddala kyali kiseera.
He didn’t really want to.	Mu butuufu yali tayagala.
But there is a clock on this thing.	Naye waliwo essaawa ku kintu kino.
He told me that.	Yang’amba nti.
And that was it, of course.	Era ekyo kye kyali, ddala.
And you know exactly when.	Era omanyi bulungi ddi.
He made a phone call.	Yakola essimu.
Not even in the room.	Si wadde mu kisenge.
He said he would not be with his wife.	Yagambye nti tagenda kubeera na mukyala we.
And you .	Naawe .
I can’t even believe it.	Siyinza na kukkiriza.
He knew he shouldn't be here.	Yali akimanyi nti tasaanidde kubeera wano.
I didn’t even want to be here.	Nnali saagala na kubeera wano.
But there’s something there that’s good.	Naye waliwo ekintu awo nga kirungi.
My father is doing well right now.	Taata akola bulungi mu kiseera kino.
There is always a way.	Bulijjo waliwo engeri.
That was something he could definitely do.	Ekyo kyali kintu kye yali asobola okukola mazima ddala.
He's still very lucky.	N'okutuusa kati wa mukisa nnyo.
That’s not exactly the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri ddala.
The food was good.	Okulya kyali kirungi.
I can live with this.	Nsobola okubeera ne kino.
She looked great, she thought.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
He works very, very hard.	Akola nnyo nnyo.
This is the time to think about what we can do.	Kino kye kiseera okulowooza ku kye tusobola okukola.
This is true only in so far as it goes.	Kino kituufu mu kifo kyokka we kigenda.
He knew that was just not all.	Yali akimanyi nti ekyo si kyokka kyokka.
I should do that too.	Ekyo nange nsaanidde okukikola.
But no one talks to me.	Naye tewali ayogera nange.
He was a very strong man.	Yali musajja wa maanyi nnyo.
Good to be with you today.	Kirungi okubeera naawe leero.
All those things.	Ebintu ebyo byonna.
He knows exactly what he did.	Amanyi bulungi kye yakola.
I’m already there.	Nze ndi dda.
But, at the same time, it’s not.	Naye, mu kiseera kye kimu, si bwe kiri.
But he wasn’t well.	Naye yali talina bulungi.
Actually, it was my plan.	Mu butuufu, yali nteekateeka yange.
She loved the home.	Yali ayagala nnyo awaka.
But none in my room.	Naye tewali mu kisenge kyange.
But we should move forward.	Naye tusaanidde okugenda mu maaso.
But he does do so.	Naye akola bw’atyo.
He doesn’t have to talk to me.	Talina kwogera nange.
Nothing is right.	Tewali kintu kyonna kituufu.
Like we were one person.	Nga bwe twali omuntu omu.
You have to read up on it.	Olina okusoma okutuuka ku nsonga eyo.
It would be dangerous for you.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe gy’oli.
He knew he had to do something.	Yali akimanyi nti alina ky’alina okukola.
None of these things.	Tewali na kimu ku bino.
But not everyone is happy.	Naye si buli muntu nti musanyufu.
He does it every day.	Akikola buli lunaku.
That would be a great answer.	Ekyo kyandibadde kya kuddamu kirungi nnyo.
It was a really nice place.	Kyali kifo kirungi nnyo ddala.
But that’s not what we have.	Naye ekyo si kye tulina.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
This is not my opinion, this is fact.	Eno si ndowooza yange, eno nsonga.
You don’t know, do you? 	Tomanyi, si bwe kiri?
. . . .	.
This is where the problem lies.	Wano obuzibu we buli.
I want to know why.	Njagala okumanya lwaki.
You can’t have too much of a good thing.	Tosobola kuba na kintu kirungi nnyo.
Someone had to do all of that.	Omuntu yalina okukola ebyo byonna.
That would be a problem.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
No one talks unless they are in class.	Tewali ayogera okuggyako nga bali mu kibiina.
I will be willing to do it.	Nja kuba mwetegefu okukikola.
Here everything was feminine.	Wano nga buli kimu kyali kya mukyala.
It’s just true.	Kituufu kyokka.
We’re almost there.	Tuli kumpi awo.
But there is nothing.	Naye tewali kintu kyonna.
You will do it.	Ojja kukikola.
Will be one in three weeks.	Ajja kuba omu mu wiiki ssatu.
But he couldn't, not well.	Naye yali tasobola, si bulungi.
We all have something to contribute.	Ffenna tulina kye tusobola okukola.
This is where this thing really matters then.	Wano ekintu kino we kikulu ddala awo we.
Pretty good, actually.	Kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
That 's wrong	Ekyo kibi .
He couldn’t see anyone.	Yali tasobola kulaba muntu yenna.
We cannot accept this view.	Tetusobola kukkiriza ndowooza eno.
And everything will be fine.	Era buli kimu kijja kuba kirungi.
Now fast forward to today.	Kati mu maaso mu bwangu okutuuka leero.
And there isn’t.	Era tewali.
The only thing.	Ekintu kyokka.
He can’t know.	Tasobola kumanya.
But it wasn’t, and that was fine.	Naye si bwe kyali, era ekyo kyali kirungi.
It won’t be him.	Tekijja kuba ye.
He probably already has one.	Oboolyawo alina dda emu.
That, of course, is the crux of it.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kye kikulu ennyo mu nsonga eyo.
I think it will happen.	Ndowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
. . . .	.
I was very low, and I was out of money.	Nali wansi nnyo, era nga nfunye ssente.
This is probably true.	Kino osanga kituufu.
He was very young.	Yali muto nnyo.
He knew he could do it.	Yali akimanyi nti asobola okukikola.
He was almost there.	Yali kumpi awo.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
We are in a good position.	Tuli mu mbeera nnungi.
He did very well in school.	Yakola bulungi nnyo mu ssomero.
It was a bad idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kibi.
He's going to be fine, though.	Agenda kuba bulungi, wadde.
He said he always wanted to be here.	Yagamba nti bulijjo ayagala kubeera wano.
They were very friendly.	Baali ba mukwano nnyo.
In fact, you have no one.	Mu butuufu, tolina muntu yenna.
He will take care of everything we need.	Ajja kukola ku buli kye twetaaga.
He didn’t want to go home.	Yali tayagala kudda waka.
This is a dangerous thing.	Kino kintu kya bulabe.
Early recognition is critical.	Okumanya amangu kikulu nnyo.
I need to be alone for a while.	Nze nneetaaga okubeera nzekka okumala akaseera.
You have to re-read to get to this.	Olina okuddamu okusoma okutuuka ku kino.
It was easy.	Kyali kyangu.
In theory, that is it.	Mu ndowooza, ekyo kye kiri.
What is the problem with me? 	Kiki ekizibu gyendi?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
And there is no man.	Era tewali musajja yenna.
That’s not what’s happening today.	Ekyo si kye kigenda mu maaso leero.
He is not as strong as you are.	Si wa maanyi nga ggwe.
I just need to work.	Nze nneetaaga kukola kyokka.
I hope it’s true.	Nsuubira nti kituufu.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
It’s a friendly place.	Kifo kya mukwano.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
I don’t know what to do.	Simanyi kya kukola.
He was nowhere in sight.	Yali talina we yali alabika.
I need to think for myself for a while.	Nze nneetaaga okulowooza nzekka okumala akaseera.
I don’t think it will ever happen again.	Sirowooza nti kijja kuddamu okubaawo.
Here we are right now.	Wano we tuli mu kiseera kino.
It is very common.	Kya bulijjo nnyo.
That's why he was the best.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki yali asinga.
Everyone is going to work hard.	Buli muntu agenda kukola nnyo.
Only one, so far, at that.	Omu yekka, okutuusa kati, ku ekyo.
That was in his room.	Ekyo kyali mu kisenge kye.
He's coming tomorrow.	Ajja enkya.
But that won’t really work.	Naye ekyo mu butuufu tekijja kukola.
It’s a terrible thing.	Kintu kibi nnyo.
That’s why we’re there.	Y’ensonga lwaki tuli awo.
Every time is exactly the same.	Buli kiseera kye kimu ddala.
But he shouldn’t, not today.	Naye tasaanidde kukikola, si leero.
I’m not going to do the talking.	Sigenda kukola kwogera.
It’s a very good thing.	Kintu kirungi nnyo.
But now you’re going.	Naye kati ogenda.
This is not quite true.	Kino si kituufu nnyo.
I need to know that you are.	Nnina okumanya nti ggwe oli.
But one cannot.	Naye omuntu tasobola.
He had this trait .	Yalina engeri eno .
That he would work.	Nti yandikoze.
We’re going to do this right.	Kino tugenda kukikola bulungi.
Nothing was good.	Tewali kyali kirungi.
I'm going to talk to him.	Ngenda kwogera naye.
He tried to answer but couldn't.	Yagezaako okuddamu naye nga tasobola.
My food.	Emmere yange.
You have been very sick.	Obadde mulwadde nnyo.
No help from me at all.	Tewali buyambi okuva gyendi n’akatono.
Maybe this was telling the truth.	Mpozzi nga kino yali ayogera mazima.
Like they were the same thing.	Nga bwe baali ekintu kye kimu.
This would be just one.	Kino kyandibadde kimu kyokka.
Can you help? 	Osobola okuyamba?
. . . .	.
You are not alone my friend.	Toli wekka mukwano gwange.
He will readily agree.	Ajja kukkiriza mangu.
He had to leave school.	Yalina okuva mu ssomero.
If they were.	Singa baali.
That would be really nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi ddala.
Of course, he does.	Kya lwatu nti akola bw’atyo.
I know how it is.	Nze mmanyi engeri gye kiri.
But he was sick too.	Naye naye yali mulwadde.
This is a very important thing.	Kino kintu kikulu nnyo.
He knew you weren’t human.	Yali akimanyi nti toli muntu.
This was bad, very bad.	Kino kyali kibi, kibi nnyo.
There are many opinions.	Endowooza nnyingi.
Maybe not .	Mpozzi si bwe kiri .
He doesn’t know when or who.	Tamanyi ddi oba ani.
In fact, almost everyone does.	Mu butuufu kumpi buli muntu akola.
I do things.	Nze nkola ebintu.
He can’t talk to anyone at school.	Tasobola kwogera na muntu yenna ku ssomero.
Too bad for his girlfriend.	Kibi nnyo ku muganzi we.
And maybe they were.	Era mpozzi nga baali.
He needs me .	Yeetaaga nze .
She needed to know she was safe.	Yali yeetaaga okumanya nti yali talina bulabe.
It was just a thing of beauty and good looks.	Kyali kintu kya bulungi era nga kirabika bulungi kyokka.
Why, yes, of course.	Lwaki, ye, ddala.
I want one.	Njagala emu.
But it would be difficult.	Naye kyandibadde kizibu.
Probably more than me.	Oboolyawo okusinga nze.
You can’t tell.	Tosobola kumanya.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
I know it would be hard.	Nkimanyi nti kyandibadde kizibu.
No one has time for that.	Tewali alina budde bwa ekyo.
But you’ll be fine.	Naye ojja kuba bulungi.
I said, not much.	Nagamba, si bingi.
Either they are, or they are not.	Oba bali, oba si bwe bali.
I will make arrangements.	Nja kukola enteekateeka.
This was probably a good thing.	Kino oboolyawo kyali kintu kirungi.
And indeed, it was.	Era ddala, bwe kyali.
And every morning I thought, good.	Era buli ku makya nga ndowooza, kirungi.
That’s great with me.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo nange.
I really wanted to go.	Nnali njagala nnyo okugenda.
No luck with that.	Tewali mukisa ku ekyo.
But he was also at home.	Naye era yali waka.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
But that doesn’t matter.	Naye ekyo si kikulu.
It doesn’t matter in my opinion.	Si kikulu mu ndowooza yange.
Everyone says that.	Buli omu agamba bw’atyo.
You don’t know what it was like.	Tomanyi bwe kyali.
He cannot do anything wrong.	Tayinza kukola kibi kyonna.
I thought you would, anyway.	Nalowooza nti ojja kukikola, mu ngeri yonna.
He had nothing.	Yali talina kintu kyonna.
I feel convinced that.	Mpulira nga nkakasa nti.
Either you already have or you will.	Oba olina dda oba ojja kukikola.
He wanted to and should have done it.	Yali ayagala era yandibadde akikola.
He loved to talk.	Yali ayagala nnyo okwogera.
This can happen in one of three ways.	Kino kiyinza okubaawo mu emu ku ngeri ssatu.
And this is not the case.	Era kino si bwe kiri.
Nobody says anything.	Tewali ayogera kintu kyonna.
However, there are problems with this idea.	Kyokka waliwo obuzibu ku ndowooza eno.
This is actually a good idea.	Mu butuufu kino kirowoozo kirungi.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
It’s easy now.	Kyangu kati.
You don’t really know if anything.	Mu butuufu tomanyi oba ekintu kyonna.
My brother’s friend.	Mukwano gwa muganda wange.
This is simple but not easy.	Kino kyangu naye si kyangu.
In that house.	Mu nnyumba eyo.
I know that he has.	Nkimanyi nti alina.
That was a terrible thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi nnyo.
And now he wants you.	Era kati ayagala ggwe.
I have it.	Nze nnina.
But, well .	Naye, bulungi .
This is, of course, not true.	Kino, kya lwatu, si kituufu.
But you’ll probably be here alone.	Naye osanga ojja kuba wano wekka.
There is something in the air.	Waliwo ekintu mu bbanga.
But he was very good.	Naye yali mulungi nnyo.
He wanted to get this right.	Yali ayagala kufuna kino bulungi.
He hoped it wasn’t.	Yalina essuubi nti si bwe kiri.
Maybe he can’t.	Mpozzi nga tasobola.
There is nothing to do.	Tewali kya kukola.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
He isn’t like that.	Si bw’atyo.
It was really bad.	Kyali kibi ddala.
You though.	Ggwe wadde.
Certainly neither here nor there.	Mazima ddala si wano wadde awo.
I love reading about it.	Njagala nnyo okusoma ku nsonga eyo.
And you won’t be alone there.	Era tojja kubeera wekka eyo.
But, of course, it is real.	Naye, mazima ddala, kya ddala.
Strong and ready.	Amaanyi era nga mwetegefu.
Doing things right.	Okukola ebintu obulungi.
But he needs .	Naye yeetaaga .
They certainly are.	Mazima ddala bwe bali.
Maybe he was telling the truth.	Mpozzi yali ayogera mazima.
I didn’t know why.	Nze nali simanyi nsonga lwaki.
I couldn’t say why.	Nnali sisobola kwogera lwaki.
He knew this as well as he knew anything.	Kino yali akimanyi bulungi nga bwe yali amanyi ekintu kyonna.
It seems unreal to me.	Kirabika nga si kya ddala gyendi.
You want so many things.	Oyagala ebintu bingi nnyo.
And quickly, too.	Era mu bwangu, era.
I want it now.	Njagala kati.
But now .	Naye kati .
That is very, very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo nnyo.
But he had no money.	Naye yali talina ssente.
No, that’s not quite right.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
However, he is also aware of this problem.	Kyokka era amanyi ekizibu kino.
That’s what it was.	Kye kyali.
This isn’t too bad.	Kino si kibi nnyo.
He may have had it.	Ayinza okuba nga yalina.
Not now, he thinks, not here.	Si kati, alowooza, si wano.
Not that it really mattered.	Si nti kyali kikulu nnyo.
This is a plan.	Eno nteekateeka.
I didn’t know what to do with myself.	Nnali simanyi kya kukola ku nze kennyini.
I certainly wasn’t ready to be in a car.	Mazima ddala nnali siri mwetegefu kubeera mu mmotoka.
Everyone has a problem.	Buli muntu alina ekizibu.
That’s not a helpful attitude.	Eyo si ndowooza ya kuyamba.
Not so, now.	Si bwe kiri, kati.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka kino si bwe kiri.
Below is the schedule for this weekend.	Wansi waliwo enteekateeka ya wiikendi eno.
He might have been.	Yandiba nga bwe yali.
As with friends.	Nga bwe kiri ku mikwano.
That is not the case here.	Ekyo si bwe kiri wano.
Whatever, you know.	Kyonna, omanyi.
Now he’s doing that.	Kati akola bw’atyo.
He is doing well but is still in the hospital.	Akola bulungi naye akyali mu ddwaaliro.
And another .	Era omulala .
I thought maybe someone was behind me.	Nalowooza nti osanga waliwo omuntu emabega wange.
What he could afford.	Kye yali asobola.
Certainly none.	Mazima ddala tewali.
Either way, it would be close.	Mu ngeri yonna, yandibadde kumpi.
He's that guy over there.	Ye ggaayi oyo eyo.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
We were fine.	Twali bulungi.
I don’t know what’s going on.	Simanyi kigenda mu maaso.
But it was anything but that.	Naye kyali kintu kyonna okuggyako ekyo.
He didn't know how.	Yali tamanyi ngeri ki.
I have to say.	Nnina okugamba.
Like, really, really seeing things.	Nga, ddala, ddala okulaba ebintu.
I need to be feeling this.	Kino nneetaaga okuba nga mpulira.
But this is a problem.	Naye kino kizibu.
And it was a problem.	Era yali kizibu.
It’s time to go home.	Kye kiseera okudda eka.
He was a really good kid.	Ddala yali mwana mulungi.
I need to do that.	Ekyo nneetaaga okukikola.
It looks good.	Kirabika kirungi.
He needed to do this his way.	Kino yali yeetaaga okukikola mu ngeri ye.
Not that there was anything he could do about it.	Si nti waliwo kye yali asobola okukola ku nsonga eyo.
Nothing out of the ordinary so far.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo okutuusa kati.
I'll just have to wait.	Nja kumala kulinda.
We were in a hurry.	Twali mu bwangu.
You have a reason.	Olina ensonga.
But no, nothing.	Naye nedda, tewali kintu kyonna.
I don’t know why anyone would.	Simanyi lwaki waliwo omuntu yenna yandikoze.
He’s already done a pretty good job.	Yakola dda omulimu omulungi ennyo.
You were going to be a doctor.	Ggwe wali ogenda kubeera musawo.
I have no problems with anyone here.	Nze wano sirina buzibu bwonna na muntu yenna.
I needed food.	Nnali nneetaaga emmere.
He had no time for that kind of thinking.	Yali talina budde bwa ndowooza ya ngeri eyo.
But he knew.	Naye yali amanyi.
I think it’s up to us.	Ndowooza kiri eri ffe.
He was pretty good about it.	Yali mulungi nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
He seems like a normal father.	Alabika nga taata wa bulijjo.
And you, of course.	Era ggwe, ddala.
But something is going on.	Naye waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
Nothing could be more difficult.	Tewali kiyinza kuba kizibu okusinga ekyo.
There's not much of me in him at all.	Tewali nnyo nze mu ye n'akatono.
This is what it is.	Kino kye kiri.
And it’s probably true.	Era oboolyawo kituufu.
I was alone with him.	Nze nange twali yekka.
It won’t work now.	Tekijja kukola kati.
He wanted to be a good father like you.	Yali ayagala kubeera taata omulungi nga ggwe.
My other, my brother.	Omulala wange, muganda wange.
At this point, you know .	Mu kiseera kino, omanyi .
I'll see to that.	Nja kulaba ekyo.
I don’t want anything.	Sirina kye njagala.
He did so	Yakola bw’atyo .
I doubt he knows.	Nbuusabuusa nti amanyi.
I wanted to be with him.	Nnali njagala kubeera naye.
He should have known that.	Ekyo yandibadde akimanyi.
This is really the gist of it all.	Kino ddala kye kikulu mu byonna.
And he knew a lot.	Era yali amanyi bingi.
Tom would love it.	Tom yandiyagadde nnyo.
Surely, he couldn’t do it.	Mazima ddala, yali tasobola kukikola.
He has no idea of ​​himself.	Talina ndowooza yonna ku ye.
They were strong.	Baali ba maanyi.
I had been lucky.	Nze nali nfunye omukisa.
I feel pretty good about it.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
I thought you should know.	Nalowooza nti olina okumanya.
He must have had his reasons.	Ateekwa okuba nga yalina ensonga ze.
And this was very powerful.	Era kino kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
But of course, there’s a lot.	Naye ddala, waliwo bingi.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
And you don’t have to.	Era tolina kukikola.
He was a poet.	Yali muyimbi.
No one wanted to.	Tewali yali ayagala.
He tried to talk too much.	Yagezaako okwogera ennyo.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
No one likes the police.	Tewali ayagala poliisi.
He was ready to receive.	Yali mwetegefu okufuna.
You are just a problem.	Oli kizibu kyokka.
I guess he is .	Ntebereza nti ye .
And it’s nice to have you home.	Era kirungi okubeera naawe awaka.
It is better to do something like.	Kirungi okola ekintu nga.
He will never want to come to you again.	Tajja kuddamu kwagala kujja gy’oli.
He has been very happy.	Abadde musanyufu nnyo.
Or no one at all.	Oba tewali muntu yenna n’akatono.
He wasn’t willing to wait.	Yali si mwetegefu kulinda.
But we need to move forward.	Naye twetaaga okugenda mu maaso.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
But now that’s fine.	Naye kati ekyo kirungi.
We have things to do.	Tulina ebintu bye tulina okukola.
The person doesn’t know.	Omuntu tamanyi.
However, he will be soon.	Kyokka, ajja kuba mu bbanga ttono.
But it probably wasn’t.	Naye oboolyawo si bwe kyali.
Very good, what .	Kirungi nnyo, ki .
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
No less than three.	Tewali wansi wa ssatu.
I love that movie.	Njagala nnyo firimu eyo.
We have this movie.	Tulina firimu eno.
It’s not just about us.	Si ku ffe ffekka.
Or not always.	Oba si bulijjo.
You think about me.	Ggwe ndowooza ku nze.
He doesn’t have to do it.	Talina kukikola.
But no, that’s not my problem.	Naye nedda, ekyo si kye kizibu kyange.
He was just a human being.	Yali muntu yekka.
And, it is also very real.	Era, era kya ddala nnyo.
But they were here.	Naye baali wano.
It is absolutely true.	Kituufu ddala.
He would rather be.	Yandibadde asinga kuba.
He was in that moment right now.	Yali mu kiseera ekyo mu kiseera kino.
This is very unusual, and very bad.	Kino si kya bulijjo nnyo, era kibi nnyo.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Yali asobola okukola kyonna kye yali ayagala.
Nothing is the same.	Tewali kintu kye kimu.
This is what he loves.	Kino kye ky’ayagala ennyo.
It had to work.	Kyalina okukola.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
That was pretty close.	Ekyo kyali kya kumpi nnyo.
I love the food.	Njagala nnyo emmere.
. . . .	.
How did he find the strength to go back.	Yafuna atya amaanyi okudda emabega.
It seems like it was.	Kirabika nga bwe kyali.
But this is not the case at all.	Naye kino si bwe kiri n’akatono.
I have no idea how that can happen.	Sirina kye mmanyi engeri ekyo gye kiyinza okubaawo.
I might just do that.	Nnyinza okumala okukola ekyo.
But, of course, you know that.	Naye, kya lwatu, ekyo okimanyi.
And he continues.	Era agenda mu maaso.
He always had to be on somebody.	Bulijjo yalina okuba ku muntu.
He knew what they were.	Yali amanyi kye baali.
You can’t drive.	Tosobola kuvuga.
One on one now.	Omu ku kimu kati.
But perhaps we can move on.	Naye oboolyawo tusobola okugenda mu maaso.
But it's so easy still.	Naye nga kyangu nnyo n'okutuusa kati.
He was the one.	Ye yali omu.
No problems with the office at all.	Tewali buzibu ku ofiisi n’akatono.
He is not ordinary.	Si wa bulijjo.
And everything that’s going to happen.	Era buli kimu ekigenda okubaawo.
That might just be it.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kye kyokka.
I was well aware of that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi bulungi.
The friend said.	Mukwano bwe yagamba.
All of them, really.	Byonna, ddala.
This is very realistic.	Kino kya ddala nnyo.
He knew nothing of the sort was going to happen.	Yali amanyi nti tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo kyali kigenda kubaawo.
No one wants you.	Tewali ayagala ggwe.
Everyone did that.	Ekyo buli omu yakikola.
Of course, I was ready.	Kya lwatu nti nnali mwetegefu.
Or if you would like me either.	Oba singa wandyagadde nze oba.
Neither man admitted anything.	Tewali musajja yenna yakkiriza kintu kyonna.
But, it would be easier.	Naye, kyandibadde kyangu.
My father told me this.	Taata yang’amba bino.
No one but you would do such a thing.	Tewali muntu yenna okuggyako ggwe yandikoze ekintu ng’ekyo.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
I have to be willing to do it.	Nnina okuba nga ndi mwetegefu okukikola.
I'm so sorry.	Nsonyiwa nnyo.
I think it will be better this way, though.	Ndowooza kijja kuba kirungi mu ngeri eno, wadde.
It doesn’t matter to me.	Si kikulu gyendi.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
Like living here.	Nga okubeera wano.
Back to the police station.	Okudda ku poliisi.
It’s not hard to see why.	Si kizibu kulaba lwaki.
He has to do it.	Alina okukikola.
And he is good to me.	Era mulungi gyendi.
No one even tries to say anything nice about it.	Tewali agezaako na kwogera kintu kirungi ku nsonga eyo.
I was good to you.	Nze nali mulungi gyoli.
He could be there now.	Yali asobola okuba awo kati.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
You know what you want.	Omanyi ky’oyagala.
Your morning is wonderful.	Enkya yo nnungi nnyo.
It will probably work.	Oboolyawo kijja kukola.
He is not well.	Tali bulungi.
No one needs to know.	Tewali muntu yenna yeetaaga kumanya.
You look down mostly.	Ggwe alabika wansi okusinga.
Maybe someone will come forward.	Mpozzi waliwo ajja kujja mu maaso.
It's already there.	Kiri awo dda.
You know how it is.	Omanyi bwe kiri.
That thing there.	Ekintu ekyo eyo.
But we are, too.	Naye naffe tuli.
That would be a problem.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu.
Although not for long .	Wadde nga si kya bbanga ddene .
We have something we need.	Tulina kye twetaaga.
For a moment he could not speak.	Okumala akaseera nga tasobola kwogera.
Just like anyone else would.	Nga omuntu omulala yenna bwe yandikoze.
However, this is true.	Kyokka, kino kituufu.
Everything looks perfectly normal.	Buli kimu kirabika nga kya bulijjo ddala.
Like everything, really.	Nga buli kimu, ddala.
You will not be left alone.	Tojja kusigala wekka.
And now it’s here.	Era kati kiri wano.
In fact, he is the only one.	Mu butuufu ye yekka.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
But he’s going to do this.	Naye kino agenda kukikola.
I was desperate and scared.	Nali nfunye essuubi era nga ntya.
Would you like that .	Wandyagadde ekyo .
The reason we were here.	Ensonga lwaki twali wano.
Now, this is my opinion.	Kati, kino kye ndowooza yange.
But the problem continued.	Naye ekizibu ne kigenda mu maaso.
He knew it would come soon.	Yali akimanyi nti kijja kujja mangu.
That’s up to you and, of course, it’s up to you.	Ekyo kiri gy’oli era, ddala, kiri gy’oli.
Not the same, no.	Si kye kimu, nedda.
Always in the future.	Bulijjo mu maaso.
Maybe no one is better.	Mpozzi tewali asinga.
Going to his room.	Okugenda mu kisenge kye.
I wanted him to work.	Nnali njagala akole.
He hoped it was nothing serious.	Yalina essuubi nti si kintu kya maanyi.
Not if, when.	Si singa, ddi.
But this isn’t a movie.	Naye eno si firimu.
Everyone has an opinion.	Buli muntu alina endowooza.
He was really good.	Ddala yali mulungi.
It was a very powerful moment.	Kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
It may not work very well now.	Kiyinza obutakola nnyo kati.
That’s not hard to do.	Ekyo si kizibu kukola.
It was a very simple time.	Kyali kiseera kyangu nnyo.
And you know what, we have to.	Era omanyi kiki, tulina okukola.
But I can't believe it.	Kyokka siyinza kukkiriza.
I know that, too.	Ekyo nange nkimanyi.
He doesn’t have to be alone for a moment.	Talina kubeera yekka wadde akaseera katono.
One for each class.	Omu ku buli kibiina.
I was thinking for sure.	Nali ndowooza nga nkakasa.
However, this is not the case here.	Kyokka wano si bwe kiri.
We certainly are.	Mazima ddala tuli.
I can barely get something to eat.	Sisobola bulungi kufuna kya kulya.
But, maybe not.	Naye, mpozzi si bwe kiri.
But it was difficult.	Naye nga kizibu.
Right, like that’s going to happen.	Kituufu, nga ekyo kigenda kubaawo.
This was very true.	Kino kyali kituufu nnyo.
More than he should have done.	Okusinga ku ekyo kye yandibadde akikola.
One can get one.	Omuntu asobola okufuna emu.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ekyo tewali kibi kyonna.
I want to go home soon, hopefully soon.	Njagala kudda waka mu bbanga ttono, nsuubira mu bbanga ttono.
You will have to live with this.	Ojja kuba olina okubeera ne kino.
I always have hope.	Bulijjo nnina essuubi.
It was	Yali .
And he knows only me.	Era amanyi nze nzekka.
There’s something there.	Waliwo ekintu awo.
His house was in front.	Ennyumba ye yali mu maaso.
I actually loved it.	Mu butuufu nnali njagala nnyo.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
I want to know.	Njagala okumanya.
I think we need that.	Ndowooza ekyo twetaaga.
He is harmless to anyone.	Talina bulabe eri omuntu yenna.
What do you think?.	Ggwe olowooza ki?.
But of course he knew why.	Naye ddala yali amanyi lwaki.
He is a poet.	Ye muyimbi.
All he knew how to do.	Byonna bye yali amanyi okukola.
It’s just a regular moment.	Kiseera kya bulijjo kyokka.
Everyone was nice.	Buli omu yali mulungi.
Like, really hard.	Nga, ddala kizibu.
It’s going to be very important.	Kigenda kuba kikulu nnyo.
He definitely has the look.	Alina ddala ekifaananyi.
There is no one there.	Tewali muntu yenna awo.
Everyone would be fine.	Buli muntu yandibadde bulungi.
I suspect this will always happen.	Ntebereza nti kino kijja kubaawo bulijjo.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I love your opinion.	Njagala nnyo endowooza yo.
There are so many problems.	Obuzibu bungi nnyo.
You, as it were.	Ggwe, nga bwe kiri.
He did very well.	Yakola bulungi nnyo.
But he was very much that.	Naye yali nnyo ekyo.
It was very beautiful.	Yali nnungi nnyo.
I was afraid of that.	Ekyo nnali ntya.
You are a lucky man.	Oli musajja wa mukisa.
But it wasn’t what I was doing.	Naye si kye kyali kye nkola.
He didn’t really want much.	Yali tayagala nnyo bingi.
But my brother is here.	Naye muganda wange ali wano.
Attitude was an issue here.	Endowooza yali nsonga wano.
I do.	Nkola.
I’m fine with it.	Nze ndi bulungi.
He won’t do that.	Ekyo tajja kukikola.
Everyone should get one.	Buli muntu alina okufuna emu.
It’s not as simple as that.	Si kyangu nga ekyo.
As one up to nothing.	Nga omu okutuuka ku kintu kyonna.
Now he knows what he wants.	Kati amanyi ky’ayagala.
That is what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
I had been so alone.	Nze nali mbadde nzekka nnyo.
Very good indeed.	Kirungi nnyo ddala.
More than me.	Okusinga nze.
Maybe he could think with her.	Mpozzi yali asobola okulowooza naye.
We’ll have to see.	Tujja kuba tulina okulaba.
And the food is really good.	Era ddala emmere nnungi.
And that’s hard to do.	Era ekyo kizibu okukola.
I needed to make money.	Nnali nneetaaga okukola ssente.
We don’t have any cars whatsoever.	Tetulina mmotoka yonna mu ngeri yonna.
He says it would be easier at the office.	Agamba nti kyandibadde kyangu ku ofiisi.
I love this book.	Njagala nnyo ekitabo kino.
I’ve always known that.	Ekyo bulijjo nkimanyi.
I don’t know exactly.	Simanyi bulungi.
But he is almost always happy.	Naye abeera musanyufu kumpi buli kiseera.
Exactly, you do.	Ddala, ggwe okola.
It is normal for us.	Kya bulijjo gye tuli.
Someone knows how to do it.	Waliwo amanyi okukikola.
He is young and wants to be in school.	Muto era ayagala kubeera mu ssomero.
He's a guy.	Ye ggaayi.
And that was all he needed.	Era ekyo kyokka kye yali yeetaaga.
But that may just be me.	Naye ekyo kiyinza okuba nga nze nzekka.
Apparently you’re not the only one.	Kirabika si ggwe wekka.
I’ve been afraid of that more than anything.	Ekyo mbadde ntya okusinga ekintu kyonna.
That wasn’t true.	Ekyo kyali si kituufu.
We have to get out of here.	Tulina okuva wano.
In the room, actually.	Mu kisenge, mu butuufu.
That’s what he wanted to be.	Ekyo kye yali ayagala okuba.
In fact, he had no desire to go.	Mu butuufu, yali talina ky’ayagala kugenda.
You have to	Olina nga .
You know, something like that.	Omanyi, ekintu nga ekyo.
Now it was worse.	Kati kyali kibi nnyo.
Tomorrow yesterday.	Enkya jjo.
To someone else, he thinks.	Eri omuntu omulala, alowooza.
He was obviously happy.	Kirabika yali musanyufu.
I didn’t want money.	Nnali saagala ssente.
That was what he needed.	Ekyo kye yali yeetaaga.
He spoke clearly and well.	Yayogera bulungi era bulungi.
You won’t be me.	Tojja kuba nze.
You’re not very good either.	Naawe toli mulungi nnyo.
Maybe not always.	Mpozzi si bulijjo.
I won’t go with you.	Sijja kugenda naawe.
We probably all are now.	Oboolyawo kati ffenna tuli.
Not until we’re all okay.	Si okutuusa nga ffenna tuli bulungi.
Maybe he had to.	Mpozzi nga yalina okukikola.
That will go away soon.	Ekyo kijja kugenda mu bbanga ttono.
But he has it.	Naye alina.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
But it’s not really bad.	Naye si kibi ddala.
We are all like one.	Ffenna tuli nga omu.
That won’t happen.	Ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
He should be here next week.	Yandibadde wano wiiki ejja.
That seems pretty bad.	Ekyo kirabika kibi nnyo.
I didn’t know how to deal with this.	Kino nali simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukola ku nsonga eno.
Or he may not have.	Oba ayinza okuba nga talina.
He could handle everything so well.	Buli kimu yali asobola bulungi nnyo.
That won’t help a thing.	Ekyo tekijja kuyamba kintu.
He couldn't say how.	Yali tasobola kwogera ngeri ki.
This is not the place for you now.	Kino si kifo gy’oli kati.
But he asked anyway.	Naye yabuuza mu ngeri yonna.
That’s not what’s happening now.	Ekyo si kye kigenda mu maaso kati.
I and I were alone.	Nze nange twali ffekka.
Everyone does it.	Buli omu akikola.
I would like to know your opinion.	Njagala okumanya endowooza yo.
And it's about.	Era kiri ku...
But it’s the same thing.	Naye kye kimu.
He started really young like me.	Yatandika ddala muto nga nze.
That’s who he is now.	Oyo y’ali kati.
He actually believed what he thought was right.	Mu butuufu yakkiriza ekyo kye yali alowooza nti kituufu.
You can do it.	Osobola okukikola.
We have to think.	Tulina okulowooza.
No one should have to be like that.	Tewali muntu yenna yandibadde alina kubeera bw’atyo.
And he .	Era ye .
He was busy at the time.	Yali bbize mu kiseera ekyo.
That’s just not us.	Ekyo kyokka si ffe.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Naye kirabika ekyo si bwe kiri.
And of course, it wasn’t.	Era ddala, si bwe kyali.
He says it isn’t.	Agamba nti si bwe kiri.
He will come to	Ajja ku .
I'm not even sure if it's true.	Sikakasa wadde oba kituufu.
This, he said, would be very difficult.	Kino yagambye nti kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
I do, actually.	Nze nkola, mu butuufu.
I hope you .	Nsuubira nti ggwe .
To the police.	Eri poliisi.
He did not want to see the man again.	Yali tayagala kuddamu kulaba musajja oyo.
We should do the same.	Naffe tusaanidde okukola kye kimu.
Even for his brother.	Wadde ku muganda we.
Or was it.	Oba yali.
But he has no problem.	Naye talina buzibu.
I guess you have a point.	Ntebereza nti olina ensonga.
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
Perhaps it is .	Oboolyawo ye .
He has a lot of money.	Alina ssente nnyingi.
No one is in the classroom.	Tewali ali mu kibiina.
That’s probably what it is.	Ekyo osanga kye kiri.
I will do it too.	Nange nja kukikola.
I know, it seems like a lot.	Nkimanyi, kirabika nga bingi.
It’s not a good idea.	Si kirowoozo kirungi.
I don’t know in what way.	Simanyi mu ngeri ki.
She loved being with the guy.	Yali ayagala nnyo okubeera ne ggaayi.
I really think that’s great.	Ddala ndowooza nti ekyo kirungi nnyo.
That’s what you wanted.	Ekyo kye wali oyagala.
Delivery on time.	Okutuusa mu budde.
Almost nothing.	Kumpi si kintu kyonna.
Obviously, it is nothing of the sort.	Kya lwatu nti si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
He began to think.	Yatandika okulowooza.
But he did, all very well.	Naye yakikola, byonna bulungi nnyo.
And you were doing very well.	Era wali okola bulungi nnyo.
No one was talking to him.	Tewali yali ayogera naye.
And it went on and on.	Era ne kugenda mu maaso.
I know there is.	Nkimanyi nti waliwo.
It was a force.	Yali maanyi.
He has to see things.	Alina okulaba ebintu.
Nothing was too much trouble.	Tewali kyali kizibu nnyo.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
But there it was.	Naye awo we kyali.
It would have been easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu.
He must be the same.	Alina okuba nga bwe kiri.
What he actually does, that doesn’t matter.	Kye akola ddala, ekyo si kikulu.
And you know that’s not him, not really.	Era omanyi oyo si ye, si ddala.
It’s the same as always.	Kye kimu nga bulijjo.
He is real.	Ye wa ddala.
I’m pretty good at my job too.	Nze nange ndi mulungi nnyo mu mulimu gwange.
Which, in a sense, he did.	Ekyo, mu ngeri emu, kye yakola.
But there is one problem.	Naye waliwo ekizibu kimu.
Can anyone help? 	Waliwo ayinza okuyamba?
Apparently he’s not the only one.	Kirabika si ye yekka.
No one can do whatever you want.	Tewali osobola kukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
I feel stronger now.	Mpulira nga ndi wa maanyi kati.
He didn’t want to go.	Yali tayagala kugenda.
You can do that in many ways.	Ekyo osobola okukikola mu ngeri nnyingi.
He had to act quickly.	Yalina okukola amangu.
I know how hard this is.	Nkimanyi engeri kino gye kizibu.
I feel comfortable and confident.	Mpulira bulungi era nga nkakasa.
Or tomorrow morning.	Oba enkya ku makya.
Daily! 	Buli lunaku!
. . . .	.
I wanted to be a good wife.	Nnali njagala kubeera mukyala mulungi.
I could definitely get like this.	Nnali nsobola ddala okufuna nga kino.
This can be something you want.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekintu ky’oyagala.
That he	Nti ye .
I think everybody did.	Ndowooza buli omu yakikola.
You know how to do it now.	Omanyi okukikola kati.
He can’t do that, not now.	Ekyo tasobola kukikola, si kati.
That was just the right thing to do.	Ekyo kyali kituufu kyokka.
We are moving forward.	Tugenda mu maaso.
Whether you like it or not.	Oba oyagala oba nedda.
However, he could see.	Kyokka yali asobola okulaba.
I guess we’ll see!.	Ntebereza tujja kulaba!.
No, nothing there.	Nedda, tewali kintu kyonna awo.
It won’t last long until the evening.	Tekijja kumala bbanga ddene okutuusa akawungeezi.
I think it is.	Ndowooza bwe kiri.
Not too long ago.	Si bbanga ddene nnyo emabega.
And to me.	Ne gyendi.
He certainly had an opinion on everything.	Mazima ddala yalina endowooza ku buli kimu.
But it’s complicated, very complicated.	Naye kizibu, kizibu nnyo.
I have a problem	Nnina ekizibu .
He couldn’t even speak.	Yali tasobola na kwogera.
We certainly can’t.	Mazima ddala tetusobola.
That we’re almost there.	Nti tuli kumpi awo.
I don’t come with anything.	Sijja na kintu kyonna.
It had to be now.	Kyalina okuba nga kati.
Just like anyone else.	Nga omuntu omulala yenna.
But it was actually a little more intense than that.	Naye mu butuufu kyali kya maanyi katono okusinga ekyo.
Maybe that mattered, maybe not.	Mpozzi ekyo kyali kikulu, mpozzi si bwe kiri.
Monetization is now accelerating.	Okukola ssente kati kugenda mu maaso mu bwangu.
And it probably was.	Era oboolyawo bwe kyali.
Like, a lot.	Nga, bingi.
he comes here.	ajja wano.
He won't eat.	Tajja kulya.
She was beautiful to watch.	Yali mulungi nnyo okulaba.
I'm really, really sorry.	Nze ddala, ddala nsonyiwa.
That's why you're here.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki oli wano.
But you move on.	Naye ggwe ogenda mu maaso.
You can do it.	Oyinza okukikola.
The problem, as always, is money.	Obuzibu, nga bulijjo, ssente.
. . . .	.
He would have been like that.	Yandibadde bw’atyo.
He was in a hurry now.	Yali mu bwangu kati.
I hope you’ll be here.	Nsuubira nti ojja kubeera wano.
It’s the same as anyone else.	Kye kimu nga omuntu omulala yenna.
He is very beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo.
But that's what that is.	Naye ekyo kye ekyo.
Everyone can, will be there.	Buli muntu asobola, ajja kubeerawo.
I don’t think this will work.	Sirowooza nti kino kijja kukola.
I don’t want to go back to my house again.	Saagala kuddamu kudda mu nnyumba yange.
And maybe he would be.	Era mpozzi yandibadde bw’atyo.
But nothing is normal.	Naye tewali kintu kya bulijjo.
Doing so is very easy.	Okukola ekyo kyangu nnyo.
And you and you.	Naawe naawe.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
But it’s really very hard to do.	Naye ddala kizibu nnyo okukola.
It wasn’t the only thing.	Si kye kyali ekintu kyokka.
Not that it will be easy.	Si nti kijja kuba kyangu.
And even then .	Era ne mu kiseera ekyo .
Actually, .	Mazima, .
It doesn't matter what on.	Si kikulu kiki ku.
He should have known better, of course.	Yandibadde amanyi bulungi, ddala.
It can happen at any time.	Kiyinza okubaawo essaawa yonna.
No opinion on this.	Tewali ndowooza yonna ku nsonga eno.
But we can do that from here.	Naye ekyo tusobola okukikola okuva wano.
Everyone wants to be happy.	Buli muntu ayagala kubeera musanyufu.
But, you know, it’s not that bad.	Naye, omanyi, si kibi nnyo.
It was his time.	Kyali kiseera kye.
I really have to go.	Nze ddala nnina okugenda.
And it’s very easy to do.	Era kyangu nnyo okukola.
He spoke to me.	Yayogera nange.
I have work in the morning.	Nnina omulimu ku makya.
Here we are now.	Wano we tuli kati.
I don’t know where to go from here.	Simanyi gye ngenda okuva wano.
It’s just an idea.	Kirowoozo kyokka.
But that wasn’t his problem.	Naye ekyo si kye kyali ekizibu kye.
However, there is a huge problem here.	Kyokka wano waliwo obuzibu bungi nnyo.
Either way, we have no choice.	Mu ngeri yonna, tetulina kya kukola.
I have a lot of things to say.	Nnina ebintu bingi bye njagala okwogera.
It’s not just mine.	Si kyange kyokka.
My plan is this.	Enteekateeka yange eri eno.
I think he wants in jail.	Ndowooza ayagala mu kkomera.
No! 	Nedda!
nope! 	nedda!
It was a beautiful house.	Yali nnyumba nnungi.
That’s what I’m hoping for.	Ekyo kye nsuubira.
He doesn’t need much.	Teyeetaaga bingi.
Why isn't he in jail?.	Lwaki tali mu kkomera?.
. . . .	.
He did it in his own way.	Yakikola mu ngeri ye.
To everyone, time is money.	Eri buli muntu, obudde ssente.
However, it would be too close.	Kyokka, kyandibadde kumpi nnyo.
It is obviously difficult.	Kya lwatu nti kizibu.
But we are a process.	Naye ffe tuli nkola.
Behind it all, there you are.	Emabega wa byonna, awo gy’oli.
For me that is it.	Ku nze ekyo kye.
Then he knew what to do.	Awo n’amanya ky’alina okukola.
That will definitely come.	Ekyo kijja mazima ddala.
He would still be with us today.	Yandibadde akyali naffe leero.
I am in the hospital.	Ndi mu ddwaaliro.
You will do almost the same thing every day.	Ojja kukola kumpi ekintu kye kimu buli lunaku.
But this is not really true.	Naye kino mu butuufu si kituufu.
But he wanted to do the same.	Naye naye yali ayagala okukola kye kimu.
He does a good job.	Akola omulimu mulungi.
We are here for my son.	Tuli wano ku lwa mwana wange.
I can’t say what’s going to happen now.	Siyinza kwogera kigenda kubaawo kati.
Now he knew everything.	Kati yali amanyi buli kimu.
He, alone, knew the house well.	Ye, yekka, yali amanyi bulungi ennyumba.
Every one of us knows that.	Ekyo buli omu ku ffe akimanyi.
He wanted to help, of course he did.	Yali ayagala okuyamba, ddala yakikola.
However, now.	Kyokka kati.
You are not in any place.	Toli mu kifo kyonna.
A really nice guy.	Ggaayi omulungi ddala.
You are not him.	Ggwe si ye ye.
There is with him.	Waliwo naye.
I want it everywhere on me.	Njagala buli wamu ku nze.
It would have been easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu.
You’re better than us, you know that.	Ggwe asinga ffe, ekyo okimanyi.
That was almost too bad.	Ekyo kumpi kyali kibi nnyo.
And now there’s this.	Era kati waliwo kino.
I have you.	Nze nnina ggwe.
There are so many things in you.	Ebintu bingi nnyo mu ggwe.
Certainly not what he wanted.	Mazima ddala si kye yali ayagala.
This is the problem here.	Kino kye kizibu wano.
Everyone either has it or knows someone that has it.	Buli muntu oba alina oba amanyi omuntu nti alina.
Now I was nothing.	Kati nnali siri kintu kyonna.
But that’s not entirely true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu ddala.
It doesn’t matter though.	Si kikulu wadde.
He is really happy.	Ddala musanyufu.
That was true in a sense.	Ekyo kyali kituufu mu ngeri emu.
Neither you nor anyone else.	Wadde ggwe wadde omuntu omulala yenna.
One-on-one.	Omuntu ku muntu.
I know that it is not.	Nkimanyi nti si bwe kiri.
He hoped something would happen.	Yalina essuubi nti waliwo ekigenda okubaawo.
He speaks to us.	Ayogera naffe.
Everything is in place.	Buli kimu kiri mu kifo.
It’s very hard to be on the sidelines.	Kizibu nnyo okubeera ku ludda.
It’s a common problem.	Kizibu kya bulijjo.
I really want one.	Njagala nnyo emu.
What a blessing for me.	Nga kya mukisa gyendi.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
I live one hour at a time.	Nze mbeera essaawa emu ku emu.
His wife is not from here.	Mukyala we si wa wano.
I don’t really care.	Nze sifaayo nnyo.
I will keep going here.	Nja kusigala nga ngenda wano.
This will not always be true.	Kino tekijja kuba kituufu bulijjo.
You can be anything you want to be.	Osobola okuba ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala okuba.
Either way, it’s up to you.	Mu ngeri yonna, kiri gy’oli.
Obviously not well.	Kya lwatu si bulungi.
But he couldn't speak.	Naye yali tasobola kwogera.
He was a real person.	Yali muntu ddala.
It’s really something.	Ddala kintu.
No one but me knew.	Tewali muntu yenna okuggyako nze yali amanyi.
He looked younger.	Yalabika nga muto.
No, he said, he had to be there.	Nedda, yagamba nti, yalina okuba eyo.
I wish I could get it right away.	Njagala nnyo okufuna amangu ddala.
Where it was for.	Gye kyali kya.
We’ll see tomorrow.	Tujja kulaba enkya.
The things he saw.	Ebintu bye yalaba.
One by one.	Omu ku omu.
From work.	Okuva ku mulimu.
It would be better, perhaps, if they were.	Kyandibadde kirungi, mpozzi, singa baali.
It is, very important.	Kiri, kikulu nnyo.
Everything was as he imagined.	Buli kimu kyali nga bwe yali alowooza.
I need to talk to you.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe.
And this indeed was the case.	Era kino ddala bwe kyali.
I have no idea who it is.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ani.
And my house looked great.	Era ennyumba yange yalabika bulungi nnyo.
You should have come with you.	Naawe wandibadde ojja naawe.
I thought it was a man.	Nalowooza nti yali musajja.
He did it before.	Yakikola emabegako.
I couldn’t speak at all.	Nnali sisobola kwogera n’akatono.
I won’t go to the office every day.	Sijja kugenda mu ofiisi buli lunaku.
We really need it.	Twetaaga nnyo ddala.
This is a very important place.	Kino kifo kikulu nnyo.
Easy, that one.	Kyangu, oyo.
He seemed so happy tonight.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo ekiro kino.
How really awful.	Nga ddala kibi nnyo.
I'm glad he's happy.	Ndi musanyufu nti musanyufu.
I am alone with myself.	Nze nange yekka.
In this problem.	Mu kizibu kino.
He was there all the time.	Yali awo buli kiseera.
That would be much easier.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
And you know, it almost happened.	Era omanyi, kyali kumpi okubaawo.
But that’s all.	Naye ekyo kyokka.
It was both.	Yali bombi.
That’s what we all are.	Ekyo ffenna kye tuli.
But he really did.	Naye ddala yakikola.
And he really doesn’t have any friends, other than me.	Era ddala talina mukwano gwe, okuggyako nze.
This is not important.	Kino si kikulu.
The thing is there is a time for everything.	Ekintu kiri nti buli kintu waliwo obudde.
No one knew where he was.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yali.
All or nothing.	Byonna oba tewali kintu kyonna.
This can happen for many reasons.	Kino kiyinza okubaawo ensonga nnyingi.
We have to do that ourselves.	Ekyo tulina okukikola ffekka.
He was a poet.	Yali muyimbi.
But one can go on.	Naye omuntu asobola okugenda mu maaso.
But here are my thoughts.	Naye bino bye ndowooza.
But he couldn’t do it alone.	Naye yali tasobola kukikola yekka.
I think this will be great though.	Ndowooza kino kijja kuba kirungi nnyo wadde.
He was going home.	Yali agenda waka.
This is a police matter.	Eno nsonga ya poliisi.
For maybe an hour.	Okumala mpozzi essaawa emu.
You are too young for this.	Oli muto nnyo ku kino.
But he's still good.	Naye akyali mulungi.
Or almost all the time.	Oba kumpi buli kiseera.
It’s easy for us to see that now.	Kyangu gye tuli okulaba ekyo kati.
That would just be a problem.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu kyokka.
Indeed.	Ddala ddala.
He is definitely the one.	Mazima ddala ye ye.
But he was mine.	Naye ye yali wange.
I needed money too.	Ssente nange nnali nneetaaga.
Probably really hard to know.	Oboolyawo ddala kizibu okumanya.
No one tried to have a romantic relationship.	Tewali yagezaako kuba na mukwano gwa mukwano.
Maybe there is .	Mpozzi nga waliwo .
I don’t want to talk to anyone.	Saagala kwogera na muntu yenna.
Perhaps he knew it.	Oboolyawo yali akimanyi.
That’s not the time right now.	Ekyo si kye kiseera mu kiseera kino.
I know this is hard work.	Nkimanyi nti guno mulimu gwa maanyi.
I feel so lucky to have him.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa nnyo okubeera naye.
I had found what I wanted.	Nnali nfunye kye njagala.
I really don’t know how to proceed.	Mu butuufu simanyi ngeri ya kugenda mu maaso.
He could swim any of us.	Yali asobola okuwuga omuntu yenna ku ffe.
At the wedding.	Ku mbaga.
He was very obviously alone.	Yali kirabika nnyo nti yali yekka.
I feel it too.	Nze nange mpulira.
It is very accurate.	Kituufu nnyo.
It is very close.	Kiri kumpi nnyo.
Now this is a problem.	Kati kino kizibu.
You look good yourself.	Ggwe kennyini olabika bulungi.
He was very knowledgeable.	Yali amanyi nnyo.
That won’t work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola.
But today is not the day.	Naye leero si lwe lunaku.
He could think of what she could have said.	Yali asobola okulowooza ku ekyo kye yandibadde ayogera.
One cannot work yesterday or tomorrow.	Omuntu tasobola kukola jjo oba enkya.
I really didn’t want to be alone.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kubeera nzekka.
You can do what you want.	Osobola okukola ekyo ky’oyagala.
However, that will probably be fine.	Kyokka, oboolyawo ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
I thought you had to beat everybody.	Nalowooza nti olina okukuba buli muntu.
He is very happy.	Ali musanyufu nnyo.
No one knows where.	Tewali amanyi wa.
We can’t do it.	Ffe tetusobola kukikola.
We are about as lucky as can be.	Tuli kumpi ba mukisa nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
To everyone he is though.	Eri buli omu ye wadde.
It will do something.	Kijja kukola ekintu.
I think you should go.	Ndowooza wandibadde ogenda.
That’s not the only reality.	Ekyo si kye kituufu kyokka.
He had to quit his job.	Yalina okuva ku mulimu gwe.
Now it’s my turn.	Kati kye kiseera kyange.
He's been busy today.	Abadde bbize leero.
He had to get to the house.	Yalina okutuuka mu nnyumba.
But, but, but.	Naye, naye, naye.
In this case, they are not.	Mu mbeera eno, si bwe bali.
And very good, too.	Era nga kirungi nnyo, era.
I think the problem is in the system.	Ndowooza obuzibu buli mu nkola.
And it was so easy.	Era nga kyangu nnyo.
He probably shouldn’t even be here.	Oboolyawo tasaanidde na kubeera wano.
This is not an answer.	Kino si kya kuddamu.
These are the things we’re going to do.	Bino bye tugenda okukola.
That’s not too difficult.	Ekyo si kizibu nnyo.
A blessing indeed.	Omukisa ddala.
With absolutely nothing.	Nga talina kintu kyonna ddala.
This is absolutely true.	Kino ddala kituufu.
Maybe it’s as good as you.	Mpozzi nga kirungi nga ggwe.
It is now at about 100 hours.	Kati eri ku ssaawa nga 100.
It really is as simple as that.	Ddala kyangu nga ekyo.
It’s going to be good.	Kigenda kuba kirungi.
You are not in any place.	Toli mu kifo kyonna.
It’s not a good practice.	Si nkola nnungi.
I was happy too.	Nange nnali musanyufu.
There is just nothing.	Tewali kyokka.
Or, not as badly.	Oba, si nga kibi nnyo.
However, it will be difficult.	Kyokka, kijja kuba kizibu.
I wondered about it.	Nneebuuza ku nsonga eyo.
Office day all tomorrow.	Olunaku lwa ofiisi enkya yonna.
He was so happy to be home.	Yali musanyufu nnyo okudda eka.
Everything is just fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi kyokka.
There are three ways.	Waliwo engeri ssatu.
It’s good for you.	Kirungi gyoli.
For how long .	Okumala bbanga ki .
That was a good idea.	Ekyo kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
I really, really hope this happens.	Nze ddala, ddala nsuubira nti kino kijja kubaawo.
I won’t do any trouble.	Sijja kukola buzibu bwonna.
You don’t have to do that.	Ekyo tolina kukikola.
One for each of us.	Omu ku buli omu ku ffe.
Like, why are you even here?.	Nga, lwaki oli ne wano?.
And that’s what he is.	Era ekyo ky’ali.
We'll talk again in the evening.	Tujja kuddamu okwogera akawungeezi.
He wanted to help.	Yali ayagala kuyamba.
I have a lot to do here.	Nnina bingi bye nkola wano.
You are not a real doctor.	Toli musawo ddala.
No one will speak.	Tewali ajja kwogera.
You really have to.	Ddala olina.
That will do it just fine.	Ekyo kijja kukikola bulungi.
I needed to be on his side.	Nnali nneetaaga okubeera ku ludda lwe.
He loves being with her.	Ayagala nnyo okubeera naye.
I'm sorry, everyone, she thought.	Nsonyiwa, buli omu, bwe yalowooza.
That won’t work.	Ekyo tekijja kukola.
Really.	Kituufu.
Or even that you’re not good at school.	Oba wadde nti toli mulungi ku ssomero.
He certainly didn’t want to drive anywhere.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala kuvuga yonna.
He would love it.	Yandiyagadde nnyo.
You should read that book.	Olina okusoma ekitabo ekyo.
I can’t do anything wrong.	Siyinza kukola kibi kyonna.
He couldn’t do anything normally.	Yali tasobola kukola kintu kyonna mu ngeri ya bulijjo.
I live every day.	Nze mbeera buli lunaku.
This doesn’t seem to be true.	Kino kirabika si kituufu.
I don’t have much time.	Sirina budde bungi.
He could never truly love someone.	Yali tayinza kwagala muntu mu mazima.
He did it out of love.	Yakikola lwa kwagala.
We can’t tell the truth now.	Tetusobola kwogera mazima kati.
You're good to go.	Oli mulungi okugenda.
I'll drive .	Nja kuvuga .
He went very quickly.	Yagenda mangu nnyo.
He knew he could do this.	Yali akimanyi nti kino asobola okukikola.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
That would be quick.	Ekyo kyandibadde kya mangu.
I don’t want that here.	Ekyo saagala wano.
I will address this.	Kino nja kukola ku nsonga eno.
I’m busy right now.	Nze kati ndi bbize.
You have the money.	Ssente olina.
This is where he needed to go.	Wano we yali yeetaaga okugenda.
You are in my city.	Oli mu kibuga kyange.
This was both good and bad.	Kino kyali kirungi era kibi.
Here it was.	Wano we kyali.
He hoped he had.	Yalina essuubi nti yalina.
On my way home.	Nga ngenda okudda eka.
It was quick and easy.	Kyali kyangu era nga kyangu.
I, not him.	Nze, si ye.
That's what you want.	Ekyo ky'oyagala.
He knew this was coming.	Yali akimanyi nti kino kijja.
It worked for my wife.	Yakola ku mukyala wange.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
This is what he wants.	Kino ayagala.
A little too harmless .	Katono nnyo nga tewali bulabe .
But here is none of that.	Naye wano tewali ku ebyo.
That was normal.	Ekyo kyali kya bulijjo.
I don’t know who to call.	Simanyi ani gwe nnyinza okukuba essimu.
But one thing though.	Naye ekintu kimu wadde.
He did it.	Yakikola.
You don’t belong in this house.	Toli wa mu nnyumba eno.
He knew it, of course.	Yali akimanyi, ddala.
I don’t have a boyfriend now.	Kati sirina muganzi.
He is also a good teacher.	Era musomesa mulungi.
We will all be friends.	Ffenna tujja kuba ba mukwano.
This job, you know .	Omulimu guno, omanyi .
He doesn’t know what time it is.	Tamanyi ssaawa ki.
He might have known .	Yandiba nga yali akimanyi .
All by myself.	Byonna nzekka.
And from there .	Era okuva awo .
But in reality it is not.	Naye mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
He loved working on cars.	Yali ayagala nnyo okukola ku mmotoka.
He is a very nice man.	Ye musajja mulungi nnyo.
But it was much more complicated than that, he thought.	Naye kyali kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo, bwe yalowooza.
Great to work with you.	Kirungi nnyo okukola naawe.
It was a good plan.	Yali nteekateeka nnungi.
No! 	Nedda!
He could have been anyone.	Yali asobola okuba omuntu yenna.
What is this .	Kino kye ki .
We are not alone in this car.	Si ffe ffekka mu mmotoka eno.
It’s not my thing.	Si kintu kyange.
Everything will be fine tomorrow.	Buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi enkya.
He seems to be going into a lot of trouble.	Alabika agenda mu buzibu bungi.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
Not him, that.	Si ye, ekyo.
That’s pretty easy.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo.
I hope you might as well.	Nsuubira nti oyinza nga bwe kiri.
And, well, me.	Era, bulungi, nze.
Now I have nothing.	Kati sirina kye nnina.
More than anything, he needed food.	Okusinga ekintu kyonna, yali yeetaaga emmere.
It was the same thing.	Kyali kintu kye kimu.
And he is my everything.	Era ye buli kimu kyange.
Not everyone would.	Si buli muntu nti yandikoze.
Not us, yet.	Si ffe, n’okutuusa kati.
You want to come here.	Oyagala kujja wano.
What he wasn’t.	Kye yali si bwe yali.
My problem is time.	Ekizibu kyange kye kiseera.
He thought he knew what, but he didn’t know who.	Yalowooza nti amanyi ki, naye nga tamanyi ani.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
I guess that’s true.	Ntebereza nti ekyo kituufu.
I didn’t want a party.	Nnali saagala kabaga.
And that’s fine.	Era ekyo kiri bulungi.
He is a very lucky man.	Musajja wa mukisa nnyo.
And it could have been worse.	Era kyandibadde kibi okusinga ekyo.
We’ll see very soon.	Tujja kulaba mu bbanga ttono ddala.
She said no, not really.	Yagamba nti nedda, si ddala.
Not everyone will agree with that.	Ekyo si buli muntu nti ajja kukkiriza.
It’s a little more complicated than a person.	Kizibu katono okusinga omuntu.
He knew it would work.	Yali akimanyi nti kijja kukola.
The plan worked.	Enteekateeka eno yakola.
However, he could not see faces.	Kyokka, yali tasobola kulaba maaso.
For someone else.	Ku muntu omulala.
We needed each other.	Twali twetaaga buli omu.
He's a strong man, that.	Ye musajja wa maanyi, oyo.
You might have three weeks.	Oyinza okuba ne wiiki ssatu.
But it wasn’t really the point.	Naye mu butuufu si ye yali ensonga.
In reality, however, this is not a problem.	Kyokka mu butuufu kino si kizibu.
But he won’t do it.	Naye tajja kukikola.
I don't know what it is.	Simanyi kiki kya...
I think it was a very difficult time.	Ndowooza kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
It would be someone else.	Kyandibadde omuntu omulala.
He is all she needs.	Ye kye yeetaaga kyokka.
Here is an agenda.	Wano waliwo agenda.
We really have it as easy in many ways.	Ddala tulina nga kyangu mu ngeri nnyingi.
We have to do it.	Tulina okukikola.
A job or occupation.	Omulimu oba omulimu.
I thought he should be here.	Nalowooza nti yandibadde wano.
An hour ago.	Essaawa emu emabega.
But he couldn’t do that.	Naye ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
But it’s time to go.	Naye kye kiseera okugenda.
It’s that he can’t.	Kye kuba nti tasobola.
That's really really low.	Ekyo ddala ddala kya wansi.
It was just time to go to work.	Kyali kiseera kya kugenda ku mulimu kyokka.
That’s where it is.	Eyo gye kiri.
That is definitely not the case.	Ekyo mazima ddala si bwe kiri.
In fact it wasn’t.	Mu butuufu si bwe kyali.
A little while.	Akaseera katono.
It’s not necessarily bad.	Si kituufu nti kibi.
Everyone knew what was going to happen.	Buli omu yali amanyi ekigenda okubaawo.
But it’s not helpful.	Naye si kya kuyamba.
I hope you will too.	Nsuubira naawe ojja kukikola.
For both of them.	Ku bombi.
However, I can probably do it tonight.	Kyokka osanga nsobola okukikola ekiro kino.
I feel it now.	Mpulira kati.
He says there is no harm.	Agamba nti tewali bulabe bwonna.
And we will do whatever we can to help.	Era tujja kukola kyonna kye tusobola okuyamba.
It seems a little unrealistic to me.	Kirabika nga si kya mazima katono gyendi.
He said he would come, anyway.	Yagamba nti ajja kujja, mu ngeri yonna.
That was the moment for me.	Ekyo kye kyali akaseera gyendi.
But it was really hard going.	Naye ddala kyali kizibu okugenda.
It seems to be the case.	Kirabika nga bwe kiri.
In the same office.	Mu ofiisi emu.
That was certainly a good point.	Mazima ddala eyo yali nsonga nnungi nnyo.
I couldn’t go on.	Nnali sisobola kugenda mu maaso.
I’m working on that .	Nze nkola ku ekyo .
It is absolutely true.	Ddala ddala kituufu.
It’s hard to see anyone in that place .	Kizibu okulaba omuntu yenna mu kifo ekyo .
That would be just you.	Ekyo kyandibadde ggwe wekka.
I know you can do that.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo osobola okukikola.
No one is going.	Tewali agenda.
He needed something urgently.	Yali yeetaaga ekintu mu bwangu.
I am lucky in this room.	Nnina omukisa mu kisenge kino.
I have no idea.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
Not much, anyway.	Si bingi, mu ngeri yonna.
And these are not .	Era bino si .
Everyone has an opinion.	Buli muntu alina endowooza.
I couldn’t see anything.	Nnali sisobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
And my father had to go to his office.	Era taata yalina okugenda mu ofiisi ye.
Working very, very hard.	Okukola ennyo ennyo.
There is no way to know.	Tewali ngeri ya kumanya.
And yet you do.	Era naye ggwe okola.
Now he knew he had to.	Kati yali akimanyi nti alina okukikola.
But it had to happen this way.	Naye kyalina okubaawo mu ngeri eno.
He thought she was very popular.	Yalowooza nti yali muganzi nnyo.
But perhaps that was a problem.	Naye oboolyawo ekyo kyali kizibu.
He had been with her for a week now.	Kati yali amaze naye wiiki emu.
It was actually happening.	Mu butuufu kyali kigenda mu maaso.
You know it all too well.	Okimanyi bulungi nnyo.
I’m absolutely fine.	Nze ndi bulungi ddala.
I love the energy.	Njagala nnyo amaanyi.
It seems very difficult.	Kirabika kizibu nnyo.
Now on the side with you.	Kati ku ludda naawe.
In fact, he really didn’t need to.	Mu butuufu, ddala yali teyeetaaga.
To move forward again.	Okuddamu okugenda mu maaso.
This is true as far as it goes.	Kino kituufu okutuuka we kigenda.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
Myself, more than anything.	Nze kennyini, okusinga ekintu kyonna.
We can go much further.	Tusobola okugenda mu maaso nnyo.
However, he had one problem.	Kyokka yalina ekizibu kimu.
It’s just simple, easy and convenient.	Kyangu kyokka, kyangu era kirungi.
That was very important .	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo .
That was hard, really hard.	Ekyo kyali kizibu, kizibu ddala.
It’s hard but it’s easy.	Kizibu naye nga kyangu.
Everything was so easy.	Buli kimu kyali kyangu nnyo.
This week you are lucky.	Wiiki eno oli wa mukisa.
Not bad, just not very good, either.	Si kibi, kyokka si kirungi nnyo, era.
Maybe we should back off.	Mpozzi tusaanidde okudda emabega.
You have to step back.	Olina okudda emabega.
We’ll see if .	Tujja kulaba oba .
You know how we dogs are.	Omanyi ffe embwa bwe tuli.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
I’m sure he had no one.	Nkakasa nti yali talina muntu yenna.
No cars apparently.	Tewali mmotoka kirabika.
That would be easy.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu.
But these things .	Naye ebintu bino .
He is a very nice man.	Musajja mulungi nnyo.
He knew he had to go home.	Yali akimanyi nti alina okudda eka.
He wanted to, now.	Yali ayagala, kati.
He seemed happy, she said.	Yalabika nga musanyufu, bwe yagambye.
I really don’t know what to say!.	Mazima ddala simanyi kya kwogera!.
Always and everywhere.	Bulijjo era buli wamu.
In a way it can be very difficult.	Mu ngeri kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
I really wanted to go.	Nnali njagala nnyo okugenda.
Maybe not close.	Mpozzi nga si kumpi.
How lucky you are!.	Nga oli wa mukisa!.
It was in no way good.	Tewali ngeri yonna gye yali nnungi.
I have to know!.	Nnina okumanya!.
But something is going on.	Naye waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
In the prison.	Mu kkomera.
You’re gone for a long time.	Ogenda okumala ebbanga ddene.
You can do this!.	Kino osobola okukikola!.
In fact, it’s worse than that.	Mu butuufu, kibi okusinga ekyo.
But that won’t be enough.	Naye ekyo tekijja kumala.
In this case, .	Mu mbeera eno, .
John was always at the ready to get to work.	John bulijjo yali ku mwetegefu okutuuka ku mulimu.
I do think.	Nze nkola okulowooza.
I was in a bad place and so was he.	Nali mu kifo kibi era naye bw’atyo.
But whether this is so or not is immaterial.	Naye oba kino bwe kiri oba nedda si kikulu.
I am well aware of this.	Kino nkimanyi bulungi.
He doesn’t have to eat.	Talina kulya.
Which is a problem for me.	Kiki ekizibu gyendi.
It was something to behold.	Kyali kintu kya kulaba.
It’s a lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi nnyo.
No, too many.	Nedda, bingi nnyo.
He is a good player.	Ye muzannyi mulungi.
He was already here.	Yali dda wano.
It was love.	Kyali kwagala.
That is not an easy thing to do.	Ekyo si kintu kyangu okukola.
I think almost everyone knows that.	Ndowooza kumpi buli muntu ekyo akimanyi.
And now it’s almost back to school.	Era kati kumpi kuddamu ku ssomero.
But it was my time to go.	Naye kyali kiseera kyange okugenda.
Talking about a week is the same.	Okwogera ku wiiki emu kye kimu.
We had no idea.	Twali tetulina kirowoozo kyonna.
Ali was already there.	Ali yali awo dda.
That would be the plan.	Eyo yandibadde nteekateeka.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
He built a car.	Yakola mmotoka.
In any place.	Mu kifo kyonna.
It was really difficult.	Ddala kyali kizibu.
He was pretty good, too.	Yali mulungi nnyo, naye.
I wanted a father.	Nnali njagala taata.
He tried to think.	Yagezaako okulowooza.
And he won’t be around for long.	Era tajja kubeerawo okumala ebbanga ddene.
You can see anything you want in him.	Osobola okulaba ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala mu ye.
For a while, he did.	Okumala akaseera, yakikola.
You were in the.	Ggwe wali mu.
She had to talk to him.	Yalina okwogera naye.
Not nearly enough.	Si kumpi kumala.
He does things.	Akola ebintu.
But that is not true.	Naye ekyo si kituufu.
He seems to love it.	Kirabika ayagala nnyo.
I do like a lot of shopping.	Nze nkola nga nnyo okugula ebintu.
I’m not good enough.	Nze siri mulungi.
He does this.	Kino akikola.
For a very long time.	Okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
We will be back, of course.	Tujja kudda, ddala.
He was always like that.	Bulijjo yali bw’atyo.
Even in this case.	Ne mu mbeera eno.
I was truly lucky.	Mazima ddala nnali wa mukisa.
I think he would like anything.	Ndowooza yandiyagadde ekintu kyonna.
That is a very good point.	Eyo nsonga nnungi nnyo.
It’s good that you know.	Kirungi nti okimanyi.
And really, it doesn’t matter.	Era ddala, si kikulu.
If he had wanted to.	Singa yali ayagala.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
In fact, he won’t say all that much.	Mu butuufu, byonna tajja kwogera bingi.
Something that is difficult.	Ekintu ekizibu.
This is why we come to work here every day.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki tujja okukola wano buli lunaku.
He is a strong man.	Ye musajja wa maanyi.
Like really really a lot.	Nga ddala ddala bingi.
For anyone in the future with the same problem.	Ku muntu yenna mu maaso alina ekizibu kye kimu.
I was feeling it today.	Nali mpulira leero.
That’s where they are.	Awo we bali.
I knew it wouldn’t work.	Namanya nti tekijja kukola.
I can do those things.	Nsobola okukola ebyo.
I thought, maybe .	Nalowooza nti, oboolyawo .
I will do the same.	Nze nange nja kukola kye kimu.
But, you will get another chance.	Naye, ojja kufuna omukisa omulala.
It is obviously a police matter.	Kya lwatu nti nsonga ya poliisi.
I can’t be him.	Siyinza kubeera ye.
You are so ready.	Oli mwetegefu nnyo.
That is a serious problem.	Ekyo kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
He is with us now.	Ali naffe kati.
In the sky.	Mu bbanga.
Now at home.	Kati awaka.
So it is with everyone.	Bw’atyo bw’atyo eri buli muntu.
No one wants to.	Tewali muntu yenna ayagala.
This problem .	Ekizibu kino .
We’re going to move on.	Tugenda kugenda mu maaso.
And no one saw this coming.	Era tewali yalaba kino nga kijja.
Nothing will work.	Tewali kijja kukola.
He didn’t know what to do, or what to say.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola, oba kya kwogera.
Nothing real here.	Tewali kintu kya ddala wano.
But he isn’t.	Naye si bw’atyo.
I said that wouldn’t be a problem.	Nagamba nti ekyo tekijja kuba kizibu.
Then there was no time to talk about anything.	Awo nga tewali budde bwa kwogera ku kintu kyonna.
I love it so much!.	Njagala nnyo!.
His girlfriend said to me.	Muganzi we bwe yang’amba.
He works on weekends.	Akola ku wiikendi.
Someone has to do it.	Omuntu alina okukikola.
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
You think about it.	Olowooza ku nsonga eyo.
That would be easy.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu.
Maybe we will.	Mpozzi tujja kukikola.
There was absolutely nothing about him that he didn’t like.	Tewali n’akatono ku ye kye yali tayagala.
Maybe somewhere here.	Mpozzi waliwo wano.
It goes away very quickly.	Kigenda mangu ddala.
But it doesn’t seem to be.	Naye kirabika si bwe kiri.
That’s not mine.	Ekyo si kyange.
We have to move on now.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso kati.
It’s up to you.	Kiri ku ggwe.
But he's still good.	Naye akyali mulungi.
It is very important and very simple.	Kikulu nnyo era kyangu nnyo.
I am happy to have him here.	Ndi musanyufu okubeera naye wano.
I want to see the patient myself.	Nze kennyini njagala kulaba mulwadde.
She was beautiful.	Yali alabika bulungi.
That said, he felt really good.	Ekyo bwe yayogera, yawulira bulungi ddala.
It went very well.	Yagenda bulungi nnyo.
He is afraid of dogs too.	Atya embwa naye.
Now it's all we have.	Kati kye kyokka kye tulina.
You are good to me too.	Naawe mulungi gyendi.
But that was at home.	Naye ekyo kyali waka.
He’s like that.	Ye bw’atyo.
In practice it is and it is not.	Mu nkola bwe kiri era si bwe kiri.
You can do all of that next week.	Ekyo kyonna osobola okukikola wiiki ejja.
Here, not so much.	Wano, si nnyo.
This will work.	Kino kijja kukola.
Another friend wants to come too.	Mukwano gwe omulala naye ayagala kujja.
No one was here.	Tewali muntu yenna yali wano.
We don’t have any money, or not much.	Tetulina ssente yonna, oba si nnyingi.
You actually have three.	Mu butuufu olina ssatu.
I wonder what time it is.	Nze nneebuuza ssaawa mmeka.
But it’s not for everything.	Naye si kya buli kimu.
Something he was good at.	Ekintu kye yali mulungi mu.
It was a beautiful night.	Ekiro kyali kirungi nnyo.
But now we are here.	Naye kati tuli wano.
Now he had to do it.	Kati yalina okukikola.
I feel alone.	Mpulira nga ndi nzekka.
I don’t know what to do right now.	Simanyi kya kukola mu kiseera kino.
He always does that.	Ekyo bulijjo akikola.
I wanted to go live with him.	Nnali njagala kugenda kubeera naye.
Something only you want.	Ekintu ggwe wekka ky’oyagala.
He didn’t have to do that.	Ekyo yali talina kukikola.
He's been a little scared.	Abadde atya katono.
He wanted to talk.	Yali ayagala kwogera.
You have to work.	Olina okukola.
I just think that’s great.	Nze ndowooza kyokka nti ekyo kirungi nnyo.
And this .	Era kino .
None of his reasons.	Tewali nsonga ye yonna.
This is true for you.	Kino kituufu gy’oli.
That’s what everybody had.	Ekyo buli muntu kye yalina.
There is no going home.	Tewali kudda waka.
It’s not so easy.	Si kyangu nnyo.
It’s my opinion, you know.	Kye ndowooza yange, omanyi.
It was almost too easy.	Kumpi kyali kyangu nnyo.
A job I could do better.	Omulimu gwe nnali nsobola okukola obulungi.
I didn’t know what to do.	Nnali simanyi kya kukola.
And of course he went.	Era ddala yagenda.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
He was from here.	Yali wa wano.
Indeed, of course.	Mazima ddala, ddala.
We are very lonely.	Tuli ffekka nnyo.
But we have to be optimistic.	Naye tulina okubeera nga tulina essuubi.
I was the only child.	Nze nali mwana nzekka.
He was always in that mindset.	Bulijjo yali mu ndowooza eyo.
I am ready for that.	Ekyo ndi mwetegefu.
I can’t wait to talk to him.	Siyinza kulinda kwogera naye.
He had an hour.	Yalina essaawa emu.
It is not practical to do so.	Si kya nkola okukikola.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	Yali amanyi bulungi kye yali ayagala.
There, now you know.	Eyo, kati okimanyi.
This will never happen again.	Kino tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
Not everyone can get everything they want.	Si buli muntu nti asobola okufuna buli kimu ky’ayagala.
I feel really happy.	Mpulira ddala musanyufu.
He’s always been like that.	Bulijjo abadde bw’atyo.
I was curious too.	Nange nnali njagala okumanya.
He couldn’t see.	Yali tasobola kulaba.
However, this is very difficult to do.	Kyokka, kino kizibu nnyo okukola.
Here in this place, now.	Wano mu kifo kino, kati.
He certainly didn’t want to.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala.
That is why they are in jail right now.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki bali mu kkomera mu kiseera kino.
It certainly is there.	Mazima ddala kiri awo.
Not bad, but not good either.	Si kibi, naye era si kirungi.
It’s actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyangu nnyo.
It is not	Si bwe kiri .
. . . .	.
He is .	Ali .
That was about three.	Ekyo kyali nga ssatu.
He wanted to be here.	Yali ayagala kubeera wano.
He always knew.	Bulijjo yali amanyi.
He knows so many things.	Amanyi ebintu bingi nnyo.
Very, very young.	Muto nnyo, muto nnyo.
Nothing mattered now.	Tewali kyali kikulu kati.
And there are so many more.	Era bingi nnyo.
Everything is fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi.
It’s really pretty cool.	Ddala kirungi nnyo.
You think you’re going to be the guy.	Olowooza ggwe ogenda kubeera ggaayi.
I might as well have been.	Nnyinza okuba nga bwe nnali.
It’s as good as it gets.	Kirungi nga bwe kiri.
But he was a good father.	Naye yali taata mulungi.
You just have to do it.	Olina okukikola kyokka.
No one knew where he went.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yagenda.
Either to work or not.	Oba okukola oba nedda.
How easy this is, he thought.	Kino nga kyangu nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
Not that you really know any better.	Si nti ddala omanyi bulungi.
It’s not too bad.	Si kibi nnyo.
We can .	Tusobola .
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
But it’s close.	Naye kiri kumpi.
To him alone.	Eri ye yekka.
You can see the problem.	Osobola okulaba obuzibu.
And that can be a problem.	Era ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
But he could have.	Naye yali asobola.
He was asleep now.	Yali yeebase kati.
But not at the bottom.	Naye si wansi.
Maybe he was telling the truth.	Mpozzi yali ayogera mazima.
And man has nothing.	Era omuntu talina ky’alina.
And honestly, it’s very difficult.	Era mu butuufu, kizibu nnyo.
I know something about that.	Ekyo nnina kye mmanyi.
Maybe he could help.	Mpozzi yali asobola okuyamba.
I can read.	Nsobola okusoma.
That wasn’t the issue.	Ekyo si kye kyali ensonga.
Everyone talks, but no one really says anything.	Buli omu ayogera, naye mu butuufu tewali ayogera kintu kyonna.
There is no urgency.	Tewali bwangu bwonna.
What he loves, though, is movies.	Kyokka ky’ayagala ennyo firimu.
It could be one guy.	Kiyinza okuba ggaayi omu.
He thought of his brother.	Yalowooza ku muganda we.
He had no answer.	Yali talina kya kuddamu.
But it’s not as simple as that.	Naye si kyangu nga ekyo.
He has no answer for them.	Talina kya kuddamu gye bali.
It would probably be interesting to see who.	Oboolyawo kyandibadde kirungi okulaba ani.
Probably not.	Oboolyawo si bw’atyo.
He just wanted to go back to one room.	Yali ayagala kudda mu kisenge kimu kyokka.
It’s not like it could happen.	Si nga bwe kiyinza okubaawo.
He was doing a lot of things.	Yali akola ebintu bingi.
You have to work.	Olina okukola.
Although perhaps not.	Wadde nga mpozzi si bwe kiri.
Or what time it is.	Oba ssaawa ki.
Not like us at all.	Si nga ffe n’akatono.
I just want to be with you.	Njagala kubeera naawe kyokka.
It was something he obviously saw coming.	Kyali kintu kirabika kye yalaba nga kijja.
I knew this was coming.	Nnali nkimanyi nti kino kijja.
Anyone who wants to go can go.	Omuntu yenna ayagala okugenda asobola okugenda.
That was close, he didn't have to say.	Ekyo kyali kumpi, yali talina kwogera.
They were both now.	Baali bombi kati.
This week he is doing very well.	Wiiki eno akola bulungi nnyo.
But he needed to talk, he said.	Naye yali yeetaaga okwogera, bwe yagambye.
That was a serious problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu kya maanyi.
Stuff like this you know.	Ebintu nga bino omanyi.
It’s really nothing of the sort.	Mu butuufu si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
I live very, very well.	Nze mbeera mulungi nnyo nnyo.
Good job on these.	Omulimu mulungi ku bino.
And it’s not like that at all.	Era si bwe kiri n’akatono.
Maybe that’s not true.	Mpozzi ekyo si kituufu.
I’m sure he will.	Nkakasa nti ajja kukikola.
Maybe tomorrow, maybe never.	Mpozzi enkya, mpozzi nga tewali.
It would be good for me.	Kyandibadde kirungi gyendi.
Not too bad right now.	Si kibi nnyo mu kiseera kino.
This is just so important.	Kino kikulu nnyo kyokka.
Definitely not at home.	Mazima ddala si waka.
Apparently he thought it was fine too.	Kirabika yalowooza nti naye kyali kirungi.
We will be alone.	Tujja kuba ffekka.
I have a lot of that.	Nnina bingi ebyo.
It’s good to know you’re not alone.	Kirungi okumanya nti toli wekka.
You were a happy child.	Wali mwana musanyufu.
Why, why, why.	Lwaki, lwaki, lwaki.
Why isn't he the only one?.	Lwaki si ye yekka?.
But that’s just one place.	Naye ekyo kifo kimu kyokka.
He couldn’t speak.	Yali tasobola kwogera.
You can do it! 	Osobola okukikola!
He looks so happy today.	Alabika nga musanyufu nnyo leero.
In the car.	Mu mmotoka.
This is not the same.	Kino si kye kimu.
That is his problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kye.
He was fast asleep.	Yali yeebase nnyo.
It is in everyone.	Kiri mu buli muntu.
Nobody wanted that one.	Oyo tewali yali ayagala.
You seem to be sick.	Olabika mulwadde.
I am a very lucky woman.	Ndi mukyala wa mukisa nnyo.
Something you were very familiar with.	Ekintu kye wali omanyi ennyo.
He does leave.	Akola okugenda.
Nothing to see here.	Tewali kya kulaba wano.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Coming back from that is not difficult.	Okudda okuva mu ekyo si kizibu.
It was the only thing he could think of doing.	Kye kintu kyokka kye yali asobola okulowooza okukola.
Now it’s dangerous.	Kati kya bulabe.
And there is, perhaps, something to that.	Era waliwo, mpozzi, ekintu ku ekyo.
For him and for his work, this is very important.	Ku ye ne ku mulimu gwe, kino kikulu nnyo.
He just knew he didn't want to.	Yali akimanyi kyokka nti yali tayagala.
It’s happening all the time.	Kigenda mu maaso buli kiseera.
I thought a lot about doing this.	Nalowooza nnyo okukola kino.
I want to be a good person.	Njagala kubeera muntu mulungi.
We need to eat.	Twetaaga okulya.
How can I turn off this function.	Nnyinza ntya okuggyako omulimu guno.
Maybe it’s something simple.	Mpozzi nga kintu kyangu.
I think he was afraid.	Ndowooza yali atya.
We’ll do it again tomorrow.	Tugenda kuddamu okukikola enkya.
No one could believe it.	Tewali yali asobola kukkiriza.
Or from one.	Oba okuva mu kimu.
Hunger was common.	Enjala yali ya bulijjo.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
I love this movie.	Njagala nnyo firimu eno.
That’s all that matters.	Ekyo kyokka kye kikulu.
That in many ways seems too simple.	Ekyo mu ngeri nnyingi kirabika nga kyangu nnyo.
But it’s definitely not true in this case.	Naye ddala si kituufu mu mbeera eno.
You know it in the face.	Okimanyi mu maaso.
Of many, one.	Ku bingi, omu.
He knew he wouldn't.	Yali akimanyi nti tajja kukikola.
I live here.	Nze mbeera wano.
He goes on and on.	Agenda mu maaso.
He wasn’t ready to do it.	Yali si mwetegefu kukikola.
Someone like my father.	Omuntu nga taata wange.
There isn’t much time.	Tewali budde bungi.
It’s simple and easy.	Kyangu era kyangu.
Actually, it’s not true.	Mu butuufu, si kituufu.
Very good speech.	Okwogera bulungi nnyo.
He is a really really nice guy.	Ye ggaayi mulungi ddala ddala.
I have a very good friend back home.	Nnina mukwano gwange omulungi ennyo emabega awaka.
I can only do a little bit.	Nsobola okukola katono ddala.
You are ready for this.	Kino oli mwetegefu.
I actually do today.	Mu butuufu nkola leero.
Someone else.	Omuntu omulala.
He lives in the house.	Abeera mu nnyumba.
There is no repetition.	Tewali kuddamu kuddamu.
That was pretty easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
It’s just not a good idea.	Si kirowoozo kirungi kyokka.
This to me was a problem.	Kino gyendi kyali kizibu.
I always do.	Bulijjo nkola.
No one has anything.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kintu kyonna.
He wanted to know.	Yali ayagala okumanya.
And he does so.	Era akola bw’atyo.
Everything is very accurate.	Buli kimu kituufu nnyo.
I'm sorry, too.	Nange nsonyiwa.
I love the phone too.	Njagala nnyo essimu nange.
And that one guy.	Ne ggaayi oyo omu.
These are the things we can do.	Bino bye tusobola okukola.
We always belong and belong.	Bulijjo tuli ba era tuli ba.
I love it so much .	Nze njagala nnyo .
That’s what’s important.	Ekyo kye kikulu.
He’s already done it.	Yakikola dda.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
But it’s so bad.	Naye nga kibi nnyo.
But it was just as he expected.	Naye kyali nga bwe yali asuubira kyokka.
It’s not about making money.	Si ya kukola ssente.
Like, really easy.	Nga, ddala kyangu.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
No, there is nothing.	Nedda, tewali kintu kyonna.
But it was close.	Naye nga kyali kumpi.
It’s a really, really valid idea.	Kirowoozo kituufu ddala, ddala.
I have no plans and I feel good.	Sirina nteekateeka yonna era mpulira bulungi.
That is not easy to say.	Ekyo si kyangu kwogera.
It was always a good night.	Bulijjo kyali kirungi ekiro.
But she always looked good.	Naye bulijjo yali alabika bulungi.
Maybe this afternoon.	Mpozzi akawungeezi ka leero.
Everyone knew about the house.	Buli omu yali akimanyi ku nnyumba.
I guess the reason why you know why.	Ntebereza ensonga lwaki omanyi lwaki.
In a sense this is, of course, true.	Mu ngeri emu kino, kya lwatu, kituufu.
I think this is very difficult.	Ndowooza kino kizibu nnyo.
And that’s not all.	Era ebyo si byonna.
But he is alone.	Naye ali yekka.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
The food was very good indeed.	Emmere yali nnungi nnyo ddala.
And indeed it was.	Era ddala bwe kyali.
I'll try it.	Nja kugezaako.
But this is a system-wide approach.	Naye eno nkola ya nkola yonna.
He can on that.	Ayinza ku ekyo.
Someone can live there.	Waliwo omuntu asobola okubeera eyo.
I wonder who he is with now.	Nze nneebuuza kati ali naye ani.
That was the attitude.	Eyo ye yali endowooza.
Only about this one thing though.	Ku kino kyokka ekintu kimu wadde.
He wanted to know why.	Yali ayagala okumanya ensonga lwaki.
It was a difficult thing.	Kyali kizibu.
I think we need help.	Ndowooza twetaaga obuyambi.
There are so many reasons.	Waliwo ensonga nnyingi nnyo.
He said nothing to me.	Tewali kye yangamba.
He is not happy with you.	Si musanyufu naawe.
This is my approach.	Eno ye nkola yange.
It will be for a while.	Kye kijja kuba okumala akaseera.
He said he didn't know.	Yagambye nti tamanyi.
His city.	Kibuga kye.
I love where we are here.	Njagala nnyo we tuli wano.
Not for anyone.	Si lwa muntu yenna.
It would actually be worse.	Mu butuufu kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
There are so many opinions.	Waliwo endowooza nnyingi nnyo.
Not that he wanted to be one.	Si nti yali ayagala kubeera omu.
And also not too long ago.	Era era si bbanga ddene nnyo emabega.
It’s going to happen.	Kigenda kubeerawo.
Would that be too bad?.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi nnyo?.
That’s really good.	Ekyo kirungi ddala.
Maybe no one tried this way.	Mpozzi tewali yagezaako mu ngeri eno.
We will go to my place.	Tujja kugenda mu kifo kyange.
I hope it won’t be too hard.	Nsuubira nti tekijja kuba kizibu nnyo.
You don’t have to be an artist.	Tolina kuba muyimbi.
But this is not always the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri bulijjo.
I love that dog.	Njagala nnyo embwa eyo.
This arrangement worked very well.	Enteekateeka eno yakola bulungi nnyo.
Of course we can help.	Kya lwatu tusobola okuyamba.
Leaving school for a short time.	Okuva mu ssomero okumala akaseera katono.
More difficult than he could have imagined.	Ekizibu okusinga bwe yali asobola okulowooza.
Not so lucky there.	Si kya mukisa nnyo eyo.
But it would be wrong to go back.	Naye kyandibadde kibi okudda emabega.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
Reverse.	Okudda emabega.
I have been here a long time.	Mbadde wano ebbanga ddene.
But he shouldn’t.	Naye tasaanidde kukikola.
But it would be me.	Naye kyandibadde nze.
Going over everything again.	Okuddamu okugenda ku buli kimu.
Maybe this was just what he needed.	Mpozzi kino kye kyali kye yali yeetaaga.
It’s not exactly the same.	Si kye kimu ddala.
This is what the person said.	Kino omuntu oyo kye yayogera.
I have to do that.	Ekyo nnina okukikola.
But it doesn’t matter to me.	Naye si kikulu gyendi.
If only it were real.	Singa kyali kya ddala.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
And that’s good and bad.	Era ekyo kirungi era kibi.
There is only one problem.	Waliwo ekizibu kimu kyokka.
I got some time this morning to talk to him.	Nfunye akaseera enkya ya leero okwogera naye.
I love it so much!.	Njagala nnyo!.
I’m not anyone’s friend.	Nze siri mukwano gwa muntu yenna.
I won’t have to do it.	Sijja kuba na kukikola.
He is a tremendous healer.	Ye musawo wa maanyi nnyo.
He was there.	Yali awo.
I was feeling pretty good.	Nali mpulira bulungi nnyo.
He wasn’t my father.	Si ye yali taata wange.
Beauty is everywhere.	Obulungi buli wamu.
But this was beneath him.	Naye kino kyali wansi we.
He doesn't know exactly which is which.	Tamanyi bulungi ki ki ki.
And it’s a good one.	Era nga kirungi.
There is no ordinary relationship.	Tewali mukwano gwa bulijjo.
They are in trouble.	Bali mu buzibu.
Not really anyone.	Si ddala muntu yenna.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
You’re not going to win that way.	Togenda kuwangula mu ngeri eyo.
He went into himself.	Yagenda mu ye kennyini.
This was the case today.	Kino bwe kyali leero.
That’s not a whole lot of trouble.	Ekyo si kizibu kyonna.
Why is this so important?.	Lwaki kino kikulu nnyo?.
But he was more than that.	Naye yali asinga ekyo.
This is good for me.	Kino kirungi gyendi.
I know that much more now.	Ekyo nkimanyi nnyo kati.
That’s not a real kid.	Oyo si mwana ddala.
I’m fine right now.	Nze ndi bulungi mu kiseera kino.
I am now working.	Nze kati nkola.
You can’t do this alone.	Kino tosobola kukikola wekka.
That no one has anyone.	Nti tewali muntu yenna alina muntu yenna.
Too bad about that.	Kibi nnyo ku ekyo.
I am the only one.	Nze ndi nzekka.
I know why now.	Nkimanyi lwaki kati.
His guy was normal.	Ggaayi we yali wa bulijjo.
All he needs is a plan.	Kye yeetaaga ye nteekateeka.
Like he was real.	Nga bwe yali wa ddala.
Not always though.	Si bulijjo wadde.
And he was obviously sick.	Era kirabika yali mulwadde.
In a way, that’s good.	Mu ngeri emu, ekyo kirungi.
That’s his point.	Eyo y’ensonga ye.
He asked someone else to say no.	Yasaba omuntu omulala okugamba nti nedda.
He’s been that way for a long time.	Abadde bw’atyo okumala ebbanga ddene.
But he needs to be in trouble.	Naye yeetaaga okubeera mu buzibu.
That was a real thing.	Ekyo kyali kintu kya ddala.
And he won’t be the only one, either.	Era tajja kuba ye yekka, era.
He should have known better.	Yandibadde amanyi bulungi.
He told me so, openly.	Yangamba bw’atyo, mu lwatu.
He was a very strong man.	Yali muntu wa maanyi nnyo.
That seems pretty simple.	Ekyo kirabika nga kyangu nnyo.
He doesn’t have much of a theoretical mind.	Talina nnyo ndowooza ya ndowooza.
He could certainly get out of his car.	Mazima ddala yali asobola okuva mu mmotoka ye.
But probably not for long.	Naye oboolyawo si lwa bbanga ddene.
And neither is it with you.	Era naawe si bwe kiri.
You are not alone in this either.	Mu kino naawe toli wekka.
He wanted his money.	Yali ayagala ssente ze.
He was curious at the time.	Yali ayagala okumanya mu kiseera ekyo.
To get back here .	Okutuuka ku kudda wano .
He is in the clock.	Ali mu ssaawa.
I can’t wait to make one.	Siyinza kulinda kukola emu.
Now there is.	Kati waliwo.
It was a momentous occasion.	Kyali kiseera kikulu nnyo.
That’s what he wants.	Ekyo ky’ayagala.
For us, too.	Ku ffe, naffe.
But he had it.	Naye nga yalina.
That was true at the time.	Ekyo kyali kituufu mu kiseera ekyo.
I could picture .	Nnali nsobola okukuba ekifaananyi .
He did this, no, he did that.	Kino yakikola, nedda, ekyo yakikola.
I have to get something too.	Nange nnina okufuna ekintu.
But it was wrong.	Naye kyali kibi.
There is no place to live.	Tewali kifo kya kubeera.
It will be a very difficult time.	Kijja kuba kiseera kizibu nnyo.
I didn’t know at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali simanyi.
Not in this place.	Si mu kifo kino.
No, he didn’t know where they were.	Nedda, yali tamanyi gye bali.
I'll do what you want.	Nja kukola kyoyagala.
And yet not that thing.	Era naye si kintu ekyo.
Very happy with these.	Musanyufu nnyo ne bino.
But he was alone.	Naye yali yekka.
You obviously don’t have time for that.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo tolina budde.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
But he wanted to wait.	Naye yali ayagala kulinda.
No one will know.	Tewali ajja kumanya.
I don’t have time for this job.	Sirina budde bwa mulimu guno.
I really really want to go.	Njagala nnyo nnyo okugenda.
He wanted a little time alone.	Yali ayagala akaseera katono yekka.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
I really didn’t know.	Mazima ddala nnali simanyi.
It was a good thing he did, too.	Kyali kintu kirungi kye yakola, naye.
And she was so beautiful.	Era nga mulungi nnyo.
And this seems very powerful.	Era kino kirabika nga kya maanyi nnyo.
And you know it, too.	Era naawe okimanyi.
He's a nice guy, always was.	Ye ggaayi mulungi, bulijjo yali.
You think about it.	Olowooza ku nsonga eyo.
But he definitely loves his food now.	Naye mazima ddala ayagala nnyo emmere ye kati.
. . . .	.
He was young, but not young young.	Yali muto, naye nga si muto muto.
Where is the problem.	Obuzibu buli ludda wa.
I am doing the same right now.	Nze nkola kye kimu mu kiseera kino.
It was us, tonight.	Twali ffe, ekiro kino.
At work, at parties.	Ku mulimu, ku mbaga.
I was his wife.	Nze nali mukyala we.
That would be, you know, very powerful.	Ekyo kyandibadde, omanyi, kya maanyi nnyo.
Not for very long.	Si kumala bbanga ddene nnyo.
It is very close.	Kiri kumpi nnyo.
I’m really busy.	Nze ddala ndi bbize.
But in practice it was very difficult.	Naye mu nkola kyali kizibu nnyo.
He was there, and at the same time he wasn’t.	Yali awo, era mu kiseera kye kimu nga si bwe yali.
I want to stay in this industry.	Njagala kusigala mu mulimu guno.
He was a real person, a good person.	Yali muntu ddala, omuntu mulungi.
He is probably here.	Oboolyawo ali wano.
He doesn’t have a problem.	Talina buzibu.
You don’t know how it is.	Tomanyi bwe kiri.
I didn’t want to.	Nnali saagala.
This is a bad thing.	Kino kintu kibi.
In that way	Mu ngeri eyo .
No one knew this.	Kino tewali yali akimanyi.
For both of us, of course.	Ku ffembi, ddala.
But he didn’t have it.	Naye yali talina.
But that’s me.	Naye oyo nze.
I’m going next week.	Ngenda wiiki ejja.
I was strong too.	Nze nange nnali wa maanyi.
But that could happen.	Naye ekyo kiyinza okubaawo.
We can do that now.	Ekyo tusobola okukikola kati.
One doesn’t need to do it.	Omuntu teyeetaaga kukikola.
He couldn’t really talk.	Yali tasobola kwogera ddala.
But it was hard going.	Naye kyali kizibu okugenda.
It was what he was doing.	Kyali kye yali akola.
No one said anything.	Tewali yayogera kintu kyonna.
I wonder what he thought.	Nneebuuza kye yalowooza.
It was very accurate.	Kyali kituufu nnyo.
He was actually working hard.	Mu butuufu yali akola nnyo.
I want to know.	Njagala okumanya.
I'm going now.	Nze ngenda kati.
I am busy right now.	Ndi bbize mu kiseera kino.
. . . .	.
But you always do, always.	Naye bulijjo okola, bulijjo.
But today, we can’t talk.	Naye leero, tetusobola kwogera.
That may well be true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kijja kuba kituufu.
And that won’t be you.	Era ekyo tekijja kuba ggwe.
It was a great experience for all of us.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo eri ffenna.
How true it was.	Nga kyali kituufu nnyo.
In fact, he thought he already knew.	Mu butuufu, yalowooza nti yali amanyi dda.
But a little bit.	Naye katono.
We can do that.	Ekyo tusobola okukikola.
Nothing in return.	Tewali kintu kyonna mu kuddamu.
. . . .	.
And he was without sin.	Era yali talina kibi.
I had no problem with this.	Kino nnali sirina buzibu bwonna.
I needed to see the movie again.	Nnali nneetaaga okuddamu okulaba firimu eyo.
Three hours down.	Ssaawa ssatu wansi.
You have no idea how .	Tolina kirowoozo ku ngeri .
What an easy call it was.	Nga kyali kyangu okukuba essimu.
Speaking, speaking, speaking.	Okwogera, okwogera, okwogera.
And man, man.	Era omuntu, omuntu.
The movie he was working on was in trouble.	Firimu gye yali akola yali mu buzibu.
No, not that one.	Nedda, si oyo.
He was great to work with and always available.	Yali mulungi nnyo okukola naye era bulijjo yali mwetegefu.
But that was bad for me.	Naye ekyo kyali kibi gyendi.
It is in excellent condition.	Kiri mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
I hope you too!.	Nsuubira naawe!.
He said he would try.	Yagambye nti agenda kugezaako.
I’m going to say that again.	Ekyo ngenda kuddamu okwogera.
He’s going to try to get a job.	Agenda kugezaako okufuna omulimu.
But it is real.	Naye kya ddala.
I'm not entirely sure yet.	Sikakasa ddala n'okutuusa kati.
Very easy to talk to.	Kyangu nnyo okwogera naye.
I don’t like it either.	Nange sikyagala.
He wasn’t ready to be a father.	Yali si mwetegefu kubeera taata.
There is no policy whatsoever.	Tewali nkola yonna.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
At the time, you seemed to have no problems.	Mu kiseera ekyo wali olabika nga tolina buzibu.
No man knows except you and me.	Tewali musajja amanyi okuggyako nze naawe.
Nothing seemed real.	Tewali kyali kirabika nga kya ddala.
It’s not a way of anything.	Si ngeri ya kintu kyonna.
I wasn’t ready.	Nnali siri mwetegefu.
I’ve always wanted one too.	Bulijjo nange mbadde njagala emu.
I know immediately.	Nkimanyi mangu ddala.
But, it is.	Naye, bwe kiri.
He was absolutely visible.	Yali alabika ddala.
Everyone was very friendly.	Buli omu yali wa mukwano nnyo.
You know that’s not the case.	Omanyi ekyo si bwe kiri.
And maybe you have too.	Era mpozzi naawe olina.
He always had it on him.	Bulijjo yalina ku ye.
Very much indeed.	Bingi nnyo ddala.
I know he can.	Nkimanyi nti asobola.
He didn't know why.	Yali tamanyi lwaki.
He was what she wanted.	Ye yali ky’ayagala.
What's the problem?!.	Kiki ekizibu?!.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
You have to do it.	Olina okukikola.
That’s pretty easy.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo.
Now he couldn't.	Kati yali tasobola.
This was mine.	Kino kyali kyange.
But it was difficult.	Naye nga kizibu.
I was very young.	Nnali muto nnyo.
He is nowhere to be found.	Talina w’ali.
I think we have a date.	Ndowooza tulina olunaku.
There are basically three.	Okusinga waliwo ssatu.
This movie is finished as can be.	Firimu eno ewedde nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
For the average person.	Ku muntu wa bulijjo.
To see how far he could go.	Okulaba we yali asobola okutuuka.
So far, we haven’t.	N’okutuusa kati, tetulina.
He didn’t know exactly.	Yali tamanyi bulungi.
She looks great too.	Alabika bulungi nnyo naye.
And so it was .	Era bwe kyali .
I'll have to think.	Nja kuba nnina okulowooza.
That’s all in a hurry.	Ekyo kyokka mu bwangu.
help.	okuyamba.
I know that, of course.	Ekyo nkimanyi, ddala.
This is not an opinion.	Eno si ndowooza.
Or anyone else.	Oba omuntu omulala yenna.
And it’s not just a person.	Era si muntu yekka.
Currently none.	Mu kiseera kino tewali.
He doesn't have it.	Talina.
You are a true friend.	Oli mukwano gwa ddala.
More than the facts.	Okusinga ensonga.
They were always here on the weekends.	Bulijjo baali wano ku wiikendi.
I don’t know everything.	Simanyi buli kimu.
This is not one of those.	Kino si kye kimu ku ebyo.
He wanted it and he should have.	Yali ayagala era yandibadde ayagala.
I have no idea who to believe.	Sirina kirowoozo ku ani gwe nnyinza kukkiriza.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
No, not really and not now.	Nedda, si ddala era si kati.
He shouldn’t be here .	Talina kubeera wano .
He probably wasn’t coming.	Oboolyawo yali tajja.
He is at work.	Ali ku mulimu.
That’s not the problem.	Ekyo si kye kizibu.
It’s not anything.	Si kintu kyonna.
He wasn’t going to let it happen again.	Yali tagenda kukkiriza kuddamu kubaawo.
It will be never again.	Kijja kuba tekijja kuddamu.
I needed a job and still do.	Nnali nneetaaga omulimu era n’okutuusa kati.
My father	Taata wange .
Indeed, it is.	Ddala, bwe kiri.
He had almost everything he wanted.	Yalina kumpi buli kimu kye yali ayagala.
He made a lot of money.	Yafuna ssente nnyingi.
Always happy to talk!.	Bulijjo musanyufu okwogera!.
He speaks of you and me.	Ayogera ku nze naawe.
I am very happy to be here.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano.
No one knows for sure.	Tewali amanyi bulungi.
And for the sake of .	Era ku lwa .
He could do it now.	Yali asobola okukikola kati.
How much we need that today.	Ekyo nga twetaaga nnyo leero.
He wasn’t too nervous.	Yali talina buzibu nnyo.
Working hard.	Okukola ennyo.
Now he wanted something.	Kati yalina ky’ayagala.
I was ready to go.	Nnali mwetegefu okugenda.
And maybe none at all.	Era mpozzi nga tewali n’akatono.
But that’s not the point.	Naye eyo si y’ensonga.
That’s already a thing.	Ekyo kyali dda ekintu.
That would be me.	Ekyo kyandibadde nze.
I want a job in this.	Njagala mulimu mu kino.
I wanted to be that.	Nnali njagala kubeera ekyo.
You will do the same.	Naawe ojja kukola kye kimu.
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
It would be hard to say.	Kyandibadde kizibu okwogera.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
He knew why.	Yali amanyi lwaki.
He didn’t even know why.	Yali tamanyi na lwaki.
You can do that, you know.	Ekyo osobola okukikola, omanyi.
But he also had a duty to his friends.	Naye era yalina omulimu eri mikwano gye.
I’m working with him.	Nze nkola naye.
He loves it here.	Ayagala nnyo wano.
No issues so far.	Tewali nsonga yonna okutuusa kati.
You are like a father to me.	Oli nga taata gyendi.
It was mine.	Yali wange.
He started talking to her.	Yatandika okwogera naye.
Nothing is happening here.	Tewali kigenda mu maaso wano.
I will not speak again.	Sijja kuddamu kwogera.
Myself as well.	Nze kennyini nga bwe kiri.
You have the opportunity now to do so.	Olina omukisa kati okukikola.
Perhaps, even, he needed to go himself.	Oboolyawo, ne, yali yeetaaga okugenda ye kennyini.
When he was young.	Bwe yali akyali muto.
And you are the only person .	Era ggwe omuntu wekka .
That was all he had.	Ekyo kyokka kye yalina.
I could definitely see this book as a movie.	Ekitabo kino nnali nsobola ddala okulaba nga firimu.
But he was a man.	Naye nga musajja.
Perhaps that person will not attend.	Oboolyawo omuntu oyo tajja kujja kubeerawo.
Money is important but not everything.	Ssente kikulu naye si buli kimu.
This is mainly on the face.	Kino okusinga kiri ku maaso.
Not everyone did it.	Si buli muntu nti yakikola.
I really didn’t know how or why.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi ngeri ki oba lwaki.
Any way is good.	Engeri yonna nnungi.
He couldn’t do it here.	Yali tasobola kukikola wano.
He was a very, very good friend of mine .	Yali mukwano gwange nnyo nnyo .
It can certainly help.	Mazima ddala kiyinza okuyamba.
He was there suddenly.	Yali awo mu bwangu.
It’s very hard to do.	Kizibu nnyo okukola.
I have a feeling.	Nnina kye mpulira.
I know when I have to go.	Nze mmanyi ddi lwe nnina okugenda.
Something had to do it.	Ekintu kyalina okukikola.
But it may not be the case.	Naye kiyinza okuba nga si bwe kiri.
He knew so much.	Yali amanyi bingi nnyo.
It was just beautiful.	Kyali kirungi kyokka.
It's, what? 	Kiri, kiki?
He seems to be himself.	Alabika ye kennyini.
We need food.	Twetaaga emmere.
It’s not a good situation.	Si mbeera nnungi.
And he doesn't either, obviously.	Era naye talina, kya lwatu.
You have everything there.	Buli kimu olina awo.
It’s not really faith at all.	Mu butuufu si kukkiriza n’akatono.
I thought it might be a problem for us.	Nalowooza nti kiyinza okuba ekizibu gye tuli.
Why, nothing there! 	Lwaki, tewali kintu kyonna awo!
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
The issues are the issues.	Ensonga ze nsonga.
I know this is not true.	Nkimanyi nti kino si kituufu.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
That is a terrible thing.	Ekyo kintu kibi nnyo.
At the same time, it can be very difficult.	Mu kiseera kye kimu, kiyinza okuba ekizibu ennyo.
He didn’t need too much.	Yali teyeetaaga bingi nnyo.
Neither man spoke.	Tewali musajja yenna yayogera.
Either way, it’s good.	Mu ngeri yonna, kirungi.
They were fine.	Baali bulungi.
Maybe another one, too.	Mpozzi omulala, naye.
Everyone should be like that.	Buli muntu alina okuba bw'atyo.
It’s not realistic.	Si kya ddala.
At the time, he looked very weak.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali alabika nga talina maanyi nnyo.
On a daily basis.	Ku buli lunaku.
You won’t even know we’re there.	Tojja na kumanya nti tuli awo.
Everyone seems happy.	Buli muntu alabika nga musanyufu.
Would love this book.	Yandiyagadde ekitabo kino.
I thought this might be it, but apparently not.	Nalowooza nti kino kiyinza okuba nga kye kiri, naye kirabika si bwe kiri.
Would like to address this issue.	Wandyagadde okukola ku nsonga eno.
Or nothing for a while.	Oba tewali kintu kyonna okumala akaseera.
That is not the case here.	Ekyo si bwe kiri wano.
But no one could do anything.	Naye tewali yali asobola kukola kintu kyonna.
What a wonderful man he is.	Nga musajja mulungi nnyo.
No one lives here.	Wano tewali abeera.
He is ready to work.	Mwetegefu okukola.
Unusual.	Si kya bulijjo.
And in fact, there is.	Era mu butuufu, waliwo.
Not at all.	Si bwe kiri n’akatono.
There are many opinions.	Endowooza nnyingi.
He was with me.	Yali nange.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
We cannot know.	Tetusobola kumanya.
Not even really.	Si wadde ddala.
On a weekday.	Ku lunaku lwa wiiki.
We have hope.	Tulina essuubi.
But he's doing pretty well.	Naye akola bulungi bulungi.
Maybe he had.	Mpozzi nga yalina.
However, we can see one thing immediately.	Kyokka, tusobola okulaba ekintu kimu amangu ddala.
You work hard.	Okola nnyo.
Of course, you already know that.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo okimanyi dda.
We shall see .	Tujja kulaba .
It was a lot of money.	Yali ssente nnyingi nnyo.
However, he is still very young.	Kyokka, akyali muto nnyo.
He should have spoken sooner.	Yandibadde ayogera mangu.
You should have too.	Naawe wandibadde naawe.
Where did he go and when.	Wa gye yagenda ne ddi.
And it’s easy to see who likes whom.	Era kyangu okulaba ani ayagala ani.
Or maybe not, really.	Oba mpozzi nedda, ddala.
He wanted to go home.	Yali ayagala kudda waka.
Everyone would be so lucky.	Buli muntu yandibadde wa mukisa nnyo.
You are just like me.	Naawe oli nga nze.
It’s not a problem.	Si buzibu.
In fact, that’s not the case at all.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
I will be able to read again.	Nja kusobola okuddamu okusoma.
But that’s not what matters now.	Naye ekyo si kye kikulu kati.
But it’s a little more complicated than that.	Naye kizibu katono okusinga ekyo.
He had no such thing.	Yali talina kintu ng’ekyo.
We shall see though.	Tujja kulaba wadde.
Someone usually does it.	Omuntu atera okukikola.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
We are in that time now.	Tuli mu kiseera ekyo kati.
All that we have.	Byonna bye tulina.
Please at that time.	Nsaba mu kiseera ekyo.
This is my point.	Eno y’ensonga yange.
I just know it would work.	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti yandikoze.
nope.	nedda.
And we can’t do that.	Era ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
He was the best .	Ye yali asinga .
He's domestic, he says, too.	Ye wa waka, agamba nti, naye.
He was friendless and lonely.	Yali talina mukwano era yali yekka.
I'll call again tomorrow morning.	Nja kuddamu okukuba essimu enkya ku makya.
I will never do it again.	Sijja kuddamu kukikola.
Not here, of course.	Si wano, ddala.
It’s not like us.	Si kya nga ffe.
I still don't know what it is.	Nze n'okutuusa kati simanyi kye kiri.
I suppose that’s why.	Nsuubira nti eyo y’ensonga lwaki.
Evenings and weekends.	Akawungeezi ne wiikendi.
You don’t go either.	Naawe togenda.
But he should have.	Naye yandibadde alina.
This was a good thing.	Kino kyali kirungi.
I was actually pretty good at my job.	Mu butuufu nnali mulungi nnyo ku mulimu gwange.
However, to deal with that.	Kyokka okukola ku ekyo.
Office in the morning.	Ofiisi ku makya.
Not anyone.	Si muntu yenna.
Not in him	Si mu ye .
Perhaps that will be fine.	Oboolyawo ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
That everything is fine.	Nti buli kimu kiri bulungi.
He knew what kind of person he was.	Yali amanyi omuntu wa ngeri ki.
I feel very vulnerable myself.	Nze kennyini mpulira nga ndi mu bulabe nnyo.
Right behind me.	Emabega wange ddala.
You can do exactly the same thing.	Naawe osobola okukola ekintu kye kimu ddala.
I need some help.	Nze nneetaaga obuyambi.
He thought for a moment.	Yalowooza okumala akaseera katono.
You don’t have to do that.	Ekyo tolina kukikola.
I didn’t know what to say.	Nnali simanyi kya kwogera.
As much as it could have been anything.	Nga bwe kyali kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
He can’t do this.	Kino tasobola kukikola.
No problem, either.	Tewali buzibu, era.
Next week should be next week.	Wiiki ejja yandibadde wiiki ejja.
But that’s not happening.	Naye ekyo si kigenda mu maaso.
He's been around for a very long time.	Abadde bbanga ddene nnyo.
But he is a good man.	Naye musajja mulungi.
But that was his way.	Naye eyo ye yali engeri ye.
Apparently, he was.	Kirabika, yali...
He had a call from the hospital.	Yalina essimu okuva mu ddwaaliro.
And then, we are.	Era awo, tuli ba.
He should have been here.	Yandibadde wano.
That’s true, and also not.	Ekyo kituufu, era era si bwe kiri.
Not bad.	Si kibi.
That may or may not be the case.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri oba nedda.
Now I can’t do it.	Kati sisobola kukikola.
Of course, there is a reason.	Kya lwatu nti waliwo ensonga lwaki.
But we will do it.	Naye tujja kukikola.
It’s not hard to do.	Si kizibu kukola.
I am now a doctor.	Kati ndi musawo.
Dogs, not so much.	Embwa, si nnyo.
In theory, he did.	Mu ndowooza, yakikola.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
I can’t wait!.	Siyinza kulinda!.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
It’s not something we can do now.	Si kintu kye tusobola kukola kati.
I was thinking about someone else.	Nali ndowooza ku muntu omulala.
I need to say.	Nze nneetaaga okugamba.
I will never go back to prison.	Sijja kudda mu kkomera.
Doing this is really hard.	Okukola kino ddala kizibu.
But it will come to you.	Naye kijja kujja gy’oli.
He was fast asleep.	Yali yeebase nnyo.
This work .	Omulimu guno .
He wanted it, it was there.	Yali ayagala, kyali awo.
I had found it.	Nze nali nfunye.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
I can’t even talk to my wife.	Sisobola na kwogera ne mukyala wange.
He saw that she did too.	Yalaba nti naye yakikola.
And that	Era nti .
Maybe I’m not him at all.	Mpozzi nze si ye n’akatono.
He was busy working.	Yali bbize okukola.
But he goes anyway.	Naye agenda mu ngeri yonna.
I don’t know what to say, what to do.	Simanyi kya kwogera, kya kukola.
That’s way ahead for them.	Ekyo kiri mu maaso nnyo gye bali.
He agreed to speak.	Yakkiriza okwogera.
I can do that.	Ekyo nsobola okukikola.
He was afraid of man.	Yali atya omuntu.
What do you want to be?.	Oyagala kubeera ki?.
I can drive a car.	Nsobola okuvuga mmotoka.
However, knowing is easy.	Kyokka, okumanya kyangu.
He didn’t want to be her dad.	Yali tayagala kubeera taata we.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
However, there is nothing in .	Kyokka, tewali kintu kyonna kiri mu .
He wants to play.	Ayagala kuzannya.
In fact, we all are.	Mu butuufu, ffenna bwe tuli.
He thought about the other man for a moment.	Yalowooza ku musajja omulala okumala akaseera.
I was so ready to do it.	Nnali mwetegefu nnyo okukikola.
We’re going to talk to his wife.	Tugenda kwogera ne mukyala we.
There is food in this situation.	Waliwo emmere mu mbeera eno.
No one is here but me.	Tewali ali wano okuggyako nze.
The way it was.	Engeri gye kyali.
I will not come to harm.	Sijja kujja kukola bulabe.
I thought everyone knew.	Nalowooza nti buli omu yali akimanyi.
It’s really a blessing.	Ddala mukisa.
Who are you?.	Gwe ani?.
Who did this.	Ani yakola kino.
And my son.	Ne mwana wange.
My father was young, he went to work.	Taata yali muto, yagenda ku mulimu.
But he knew it would be true.	Naye yali akimanyi nti kijja kuba kituufu.
No, it’s not a problem.	Nedda, si kizibu.
I don’t want to work here.	Saagala kukola wano.
This arrangement worked very well.	Enteekateeka eno yakola bulungi nnyo.
And that goes for everyone here.	Era ekyo kigenda ku buli muntu wano.
But he does do so.	Naye akola bw’atyo.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
I didn’t have it.	Nze nnali sirina.
This was slightly stronger than last week.	Kino kyali kya maanyi katono okusinga wiiki ewedde.
But he wasn’t a child.	Naye yali si mwana.
Everything is excellent.	Buli kimu kirungi nnyo.
He was obviously happy himself.	Kya lwatu nti yali musanyufu ye kennyini.
He didn’t even know that .	Yali tamanyi na nti .
He couldn’t say or do anything.	Yali tasobola kwogera oba kukola kintu kyonna.
He was alone.	Yali yekka.
He just didn't know what it was.	Yali tamanyi kiki kyokka.
This will never work.	Kino tekijja kukola n’akatono.
He doesn't think.	Talowooza.
I am in the real.	Nze ndi mu ddala.
He himself will not know.	Ye kennyini tajja kumanya.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Naye si kibi.
I’m afraid that it is.	Ntya nti bwe kiri.
So he had, but he still wasn’t happy.	Bwatyo yalina, naye nga n’okutuusa kati yali si musanyufu.
Always you, you, you.	Bulijjo gwe, ggwe, ggwe.
He is very low.	Ali wansi nnyo.
However, he couldn’t be more comfortable.	Kyokka, yali tasobola kuba mwetegefu nnyo.
Thought you might have.	Yalowooza nti oyinza okuba nga wali olina.
However, I will do it.	Kyokka, nja kukikola.
For everyone everything.	Ku lwa buli muntu buli kimu.
Everything is true in a way.	Buli kimu kituufu mu ngeri emu.
He spoke quickly.	Yayogera mangu.
I already knew everything.	Buli kimu nnali mmanyi dda.
Not in the future.	Si mu maaso.
That one is also very lovely.	Oyo naye ayagala nnyo.
Which probably is.	Ekintu osanga nga bwe kiri.
That is very dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe nnyo.
Very good, that's all.	Kirungi nnyo, ekyo kyokka.
We have it.	Tulina.
I don’t want to go home.	Saagala kudda waka.
And the person.	Era omuntu.
Everything was fine now.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi kati.
It doesn’t matter to me right now.	Si kikulu gyendi mu kiseera kino.
I’m here for a friend.	Nze ndi wano ku lwa mukwano gwange.
But it is very difficult.	Naye kizibu nnyo.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Saagala kulaba muntu yenna.
That he certainly doesn’t deserve it.	Nti mazima ddala tasaanidde.
He had to hit something.	Yalina okukuba ekintu.
There is nothing more romantic than that.	Tewali kintu kya mukwano okusinga ekyo.
We have to go back to town tonight.	Tulina okudda mu kibuga ekiro kino.
This is a party.	Eno mbaga.
I think you can.	Ndowooza osobola.
No he can stay.	Nedda asobola kusigala.
It was very hard to read.	Kyali kizibu nnyo okusoma.
Both were.	Bombi baali...
It’s time to go.	Kye kiseera okugenda.
Or he thought he knew.	Oba yalowooza nti amanyi.
I will do this.	Kino nja kukikola.
You are in a state of grave danger.	Oli mu mbeera ya bulabe bwa maanyi.
We were very hungry at the time.	Twali enjala nnyo mu kiseera ekyo.
Maybe that’s a good thing.	Mpozzi ekyo kintu kirungi.
Certainly not for you.	Mazima ddala si ku ggwe.
I was there alone.	Nze nnali awo nzekka.
It was dangerous, he knew.	Kyali kya bulabe, yali akimanyi.
He certainly didn’t want to be here.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala kubeera wano.
It was absolutely beautiful.	Kyali kirungi ddala.
I feel really passionate about that.	Ekyo mpulira ddala nga njagala nnyo.
It was a reason.	Yali nsonga.
And you don’t have to either.	Era naawe tolina kukikola.
Lots of houses, though.	Ennyumba nnyingi, wadde.
He didn’t need his place.	Yali teyeetaaga kifo kye.
We can move forward.	Tusobola okugenda mu maaso.
And that is very important.	Era ekyo kikulu nnyo.
He will love it.	Ajja kwagala.
I am ready and willing to help.	Ndi mwetegefu era mwetegefu okuyamba.
Probably not so much.	Oboolyawo si nnyo.
No, I feel like it.	Nedda, mpulira nga bwe kiri.
Now, father.	Kati taata.
However, this is not all.	Kyokka, bino si byonna.
All these things.	Ebintu bino byonna.
And of course there is no answer.	Era ddala tewali kuddamu.
He was very happy there.	Yali musanyufu nnyo eyo.
But he’s been pretty good.	Naye abadde mulungi nnyo.
That is very powerful.	Ekyo kya maanyi nnyo.
He is not well.	Tali bulungi.
No one, now, thinks so.	Tewali muntu yenna, kati, alowooza bw’atyo.
He was probably talking to her even now.	Oboolyawo yali ayogera naye ne kati.
I am sure it is.	Nkakasa nti bwe kiri.
Not for good, but .	Si lwa bulungi, naye .
It is very true also.	Kituufu nnyo era.
Maybe he made up for that.	Mpozzi yakikola ku ekyo.
Or maybe that was the point.	Oba oboolyawo eyo ye yali ensonga.
This is very important to me.	Kino kikulu nnyo gyendi.
I wanted to be a kid.	Nnali njagala kubeera mwana muto.
I don’t know, really.	Simanyi, ddala.
It’s a bad idea.	Kirowoozo kibi.
My only expectation was mine.	Ekintu kyokka kye nnali nsuubira kyali kyange.
He’s always been like that.	Bulijjo abadde bw’atyo.
That’s good and bad.	Ekyo kirungi era kibi.
I could hardly believe it.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza nnyo.
He is in the hospital.	Ali mu ddwaaliro.
That's my thing.	Ekyo kye kintu kyange.
He didn’t want to talk about her at all.	Yali tayagala kwogera ku ye n’akatono.
I thought you’d like that.	Nalowooza nti ekyo wandyagadde.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nnali simanyi kiki.
But you were there too.	Naye naawe wali awo.
This, of course, we cannot do.	Kino, kya lwatu, tetusobola kukikola.
You are a good teacher.	Oli musomesa mulungi.
I don’t want to be that kind of person.	Saagala kubeera muntu wa ngeri eyo.
I love talking to myself.	Njagala nnyo okwogera nange.
And he is a good man.	Era musajja mulungi.
He needed to go to the hospital.	Yali yeetaaga okugenda mu ddwaaliro.
I am very lucky.	Nze ndi wa mukisa nnyo.
He could come home with her or her or him.	Yali asobola okudda naye awaka oba ye oba ye.
And he's beautiful.	Era mulungi.
This is very difficult to do.	Kino kizibu nnyo okukola.
However, it is not the same thing.	Kyokka, si kintu kye kimu.
He didn't have much of a face, now.	Yali talina nnyo maaso, kati.
We have to do it, we have to do it.	Tulina okukikola, tulina okukikola.
I’m very strong and really fast.	Nze ndi wa maanyi nnyo era ddala ndi wa bwangu.
He is mostly in himself.	Asinga kubeera mu ye.
Anything and everyone.	Ekintu kyonna na buli muntu.
Not anything really, really.	Si kintu kyonna ddala, ddala.
And that’s what’s important.	Era ekyo kye kikulu.
I, too, hope.	Nange, nsuubira.
Even then, you probably shouldn’t do this.	Ne mu kiseera ekyo, osanga kino tolina kukikola.
I kind of was, too.	Nze mu ngeri ya nnali, nange.
Me or anyone else.	Nze oba omuntu omulala yenna.
And you don’t want to.	Era toyagala.
You think you know everything.	Olowooza buli kimu okimanyi.
Now he was in a hurry.	Kati yali mu bwangu.
You are very happy.	Oli musanyufu nnyo.
There are no faces.	Tewali maaso.
We were friends through all of this.	Twali ba mukwano mu bino byonna.
He didn’t deserve that.	Ekyo yali tasaanidde.
I have a lot to do.	Nnina bingi bye nnina okukola.
There is no way you would know.	Tewali ngeri gye wandibadde omanyi.
I was at work.	Nnali ku mulimu.
It certainly had.	Mazima ddala kyalina.
I do have one issue.	Nze ddala nnina ensonga emu.
That’s all well and good.	Ekyo kyonna kirungi era kirungi.
But that’s not a very good situation.	Naye ekyo si mbeera nnungi nnyo.
He had to leave the room.	Yalina okuva mu kisenge.
That’s not me.	Ekyo si nze.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
There is this .	Waliwo kino .
He can and does.	Asobola era akola.
And he is my friend.	Era ye mukwano gwange.
I love it though.	Njagala nnyo wadde.
He won’t play again.	Tajja kuddamu kuzannya.
I’m fine here.	Nze wano ndi bulungi.
That’s so important!.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo!.
This was more complicated than it seemed.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo okusinga bwe kyali kirabika.
I do a lot of things.	Nkola bingi.
That was my whole plan.	Eyo ye yali enteekateeka yange yonna.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
I am well aware of that.	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi.
He was the problem.	Ye yali ekizibu.
He had no interest in that.	Ekyo yali talina ky’ayagala.
It’s not us.	Si ffe.
Either way, you have to do it.	Mu ngeri yonna, olina okukikola.
Do you like it?.	Oyagala nnyo?.
He had to get to the police.	Yalina okutuuka ku poliisi.
Now he knows better.	Kati asinga okumanya.
Everyone is in a situation.	Buli muntu ali mu mbeera.
They are in one.	Bali mu kimu.
But in many ways, it is.	Naye mu ngeri nnyingi, bwe kiri.
It will go faster that way.	Kijja kugenda mangu mu ngeri eyo.
You want the money.	Ggwe oyagala ssente.
Down this week.	Wansi wiiki eno.
He knows everything perfectly.	Buli kimu akimanyi bulungi.
There is no reason why.	Tewali nsonga lwaki...
It's his day at home.	Ye lunaku lwe awaka.
He was always a good friend.	Bulijjo yali mukwano mulungi.
I’m sorry to be human.	Nsonyiwa okuba omuntu.
And very true to.	Era nga kituufu nnyo ku.
That he was doing very well.	Nti yali akola bulungi nnyo.
Your point is its own.	Ensonga yo ya yo.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Saagala kulaba muntu yenna.
Not good, at all.	Si kirungi, n’akatono.
That is not uncommon.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo.
But so far, no luck.	Naye okutuusa kati, tewali mukisa.
There is no urgency though.	Tewali bwangu wadde.
I am happy too.	Nange ndi musanyufu.
He spoke to her.	Yayogera naye.
In fact, he did.	Mu butuufu, yakikola.
Everyone can do that.	Buli muntu asobola okukola ekyo.
No harm in like that.	Tewali bulabe bwonna mu nga ekyo.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola ku nsonga eyo.
It was mine.	Yali wange.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
We were one.	Twali kimu.
Apparently they are.	Kirabika bwe bali.
And no one could do anything about it.	Era tewali yali asobola kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
That’s what my father wanted.	Ekyo taata kye yali ayagala.
I always go with the guys.	Bulijjo ngenda ne ba ggaayi.
I think they were in school together or something.	Ndowooza baali mu ssomero bombi oba ekintu kyonna.
But he needed a job.	Naye yali yeetaaga omulimu.
????.	????.
Not there though.	Si awo wadde.
That this is true.	Nti kino kituufu.
He knew he could do it.	Yali akimanyi nti asobola okukikola.
But he didn’t want to see the truth.	Naye yali tayagala kulaba mazima.
It’s just my city.	Kibuga kyange kyokka.
However, doing so costs too much.	Kyokka, okukikola ku ssente nnyingi nnyo.
It is absolutely right now.	Kiri ddala mu kiseera kino.
However, this seems problematic.	Kyokka kino kirabika kizibu.
That was how happy he was.	Oyo bwe yali musanyufu.
That’s just not practical.	Ekyo kyokka si kya nkola.
I’m going too.	Nze nange ngenda.
I am not happy.	Siri musanyufu.
He can’t believe it himself.	Ye kennyini tasobola kukkiriza.
And then, at about.	Era awo, mu kiseera nga...
But there’s a problem with that.	Naye waliwo obuzibu ku ekyo.
That's not why we're here.	Si y'ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
But you’re going to be.	Naye ggwe ogenda kuba.
Don’t go without me.	Togenda nga si nze.
Everyone was already asleep.	Buli omu yali yeebase dda.
Maybe he was the only one.	Mpozzi ye yali yekka.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
Living here and now.	Okubeera wano ne kati.
He loved everyone.	Yali ayagala buli muntu.
He has the power	Alina amaanyi .
This seems normal.	Kino kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
He was both and not just a man.	Ye bombi yali era nga si musajja yekka.
That's why.	Ye nsonga lwaki...
I have a lot to do.	Nnina bingi bye nnina okukola.
But we were very close.	Naye twali ba mukwano nnyo.
Tomorrow is the day.	Enkya lwe lunaku.
You don’t want to be that guy, do you?.	Ggwe toyagala kubeera ggaayi oyo, nedda?.
I guess he was everywhere now.	Ntebereza nti yali buli wamu kati.
I was in my own time.	Nali mu kiseera kyange.
There was one he couldn’t believe.	Waliwo emu gye yali tayinza kukkiriza.
That was his chance.	Ekyo kye kyali omukisa gwe.
Not good for either of us.	Si kirungi eri omu ku ffe.
I don’t want to go to school.	Saagala kugenda ku ssomero.
He wasn't supposed to talk about that.	Ekyo yali talina kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
The call would have come after he left.	Essimu yandibadde ejja nga amaze okugenda.
He has had to do it himself.	Abadde alina okukikola ye kennyini.
We are here now.	Tuli wano kati.
He is my teacher.	Ye musomesa wange.
However, this is the crux of the problem.	Kyokka kino kye kikulu ennyo mu kizibu kino.
This thing is powerful.	Ekintu kino kya maanyi.
So far she had looked good.	Okutuuka wano yali alabika bulungi.
But there is, now.	Naye waliwo, kati.
And he's probably a pretty good person, too.	Era osanga naye muntu mulungi nnyo, naye.
That was my attitude.	Ekyo kye kyali endowooza yange.
But he also needed to be a good person.	Naye era yali yeetaaga okuba omuntu omulungi.
He is a person who lives alone.	Ye muntu abeera yekka.
We will talk about one.	Tujja kwogera ku kimu.
I was anybody.	Nze nali muntu yenna.
I was very forgiving.	Nnali nsonyiwa nnyo.
In fact, you go with us.	Mu butuufu, ogenda naffe.
In all of us.	Mu ffe ffenna.
He knew what he would do.	Yali amanyi kye yandikoze.
From him.	Okuva ku ye.
It could be anything, really.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna, ddala.
I am happy now.	Ndi musanyufu kati.
No one yet.	Tewali muntu yenna n’okutuusa kati.
But now he was safe.	Naye kati yali talina bulabe.
He had a request.	Yalina kye yasaba.
You're going now.	Ogenda kati.
That, of course, was pretty bad.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kyali kibi nnyo.
You’re at work.	Oli ku mulimu.
This was normal.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo.
It comes to you right now.	Kijja gyoli mu kiseera kino.
About how difficult it can be.	Ku ngeri gye kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
But that’s what he did.	Naye ekyo kye yakola.
I think he could have done much better in that regard.	Ndowooza yandibadde akola bulungi nnyo mu nsonga eyo.
We have to talk,’ he said.	Tulina okwogera,’ bwe yagambye.
It would be nice to have him.	Kyandibadde kirungi okubeera naye.
That wasn’t it at all.	Ekyo si kye kyali n’akatono.
However, this is not actually the case.	Kyokka, mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
Not for you, certainly not.	Si lwa ggwe, mazima si bwe kiri.
I could do this.	Kino nnali nsobola okukikola.
It’s not bad though.	Si kibi wadde.
He is obviously not very happy.	Kya lwatu nti si musanyufu nnyo.
You have no friends here.	Tolina mikwano wano.
It may just have been the timing.	Kiyinza okuba nga kyali kiseera kyokka.
They are all over the house.	Bali mu nnyumba yonna.
He didn't even know what to think.	Yali tamanyi na kye yandibadde alowooza.
In fact, it is.	Mu butuufu bwe kiri.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
Not everyone thinks this is a good idea.	Si buli muntu nti kino kirowoozo kirungi.
It’s not for you.	Si gy’oli.
No one wanted to be there.	Tewali yali ayagala kubeera eyo.
This is not uncommon.	Kino si kya bulijjo.
There is no policy whatsoever.	Tewali nkola yonna.
But now, it’s just you and me.	Naye kati, nze naawe ffekka.
Someone either knows or doesn’t.	Omuntu oba amanyi oba tamanyi.
This is not an issue of accuracy.	Eno si nsonga ya butuufu.
I think it’s nothing.	Ndowooza si kintu kyonna.
His wife knows it too.	Mukyala we naye akimanyi.
Nobody talks to me much.	Tewali ayogera nange nnyo.
He wanted to talk to you.	Yali ayagala okwogera naawe.
He shouldn’t do that.	Ekyo tasaanidde kukikola.
He wasn’t like me, not at all.	Yali si nga nze, si bwe kiri n’akatono.
There is one tomorrow.	Waliwo emu enkya.
It’s nothing to me.	Si kintu kyonna gyendi.
Now we have to do it again.	Kati tulina okuddamu okukikola.
You can’t just do this thing.	Tosobola kukola kintu kino kyokka.
Time doesn’t matter.	Obudde si kikulu.
At the wedding.	Ku mbaga.
They are right here and now.	Bali wano ddala ne kati.
That’s how it was with me.	Bw’atyo bwe yali ku nze.
He didn’t know why or how.	Yali tamanyi lwaki oba ngeri ki.
Good with me anyway.	Kirungi nange mu ngeri yonna.
Everyone knew it.	Buli omu yali akimanyi.
I really knew it.	Nze ddala nnali nkimanyi.
He is not well.	Tali bulungi.
You know he’s there.	Omanyi nti ali awo.
Like, everyone wants to know.	Nga, buli muntu ayagala okumanya.
Speaking too quickly.	Okwogera amangu ennyo.
Or perhaps both.	Oba oboolyawo bombi.
No one knows who he was.	Tewali amanyi ani gwe yali.
But now it is in trouble.	Naye kati kiri mu buzibu.
Not all at once, of course.	Si byonna mu kiseera kimu, ddala.
And that was really good.	Era ekyo kyali kirungi ddala.
You won’t either.	Naawe tojja kukikola.
At the moment.	Mu kiseera kino.
I know this is important.	Nkimanyi nti kino kikulu.
Instead...	Mu kifo kya...
We have to do well.	Tulina okukola obulungi.
Here's where it goes.	Wano we kigenda.
I’m not going to do that again.	Ekyo sigenda kuddamu kukikola.
Like he was there at the time or something.	Nga bwe yali awo mu kiseera ekyo oba ekintu kyonna.
You are a young, energetic woman.	Oli mukyala muto, alina amaanyi.
One problem at the time.	Ekizibu kimu mu kiseera ekyo.
Call fast, and fast, and fast.	Kuba amangu, era mu bwangu, era mu bwangu.
This could be anything.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
That is very, very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo nnyo.
Returning home.	Okudda eka.
It’s really the job I want.	Ddala gwe mulimu gwe njagala.
This was a very important step.	Kino kyali kikulu nnyo.
None of this is bad in any way.	Tewali na kimu ku bino kibi mu ngeri yonna.
You can live there.	Osobola okubeera eyo.
I didn’t think it would be good for me.	Nnali sirowooza nti kyandibadde kirungi gyendi.
He is truly alone.	Mazima ddala ali yekka.
It’s coming closer.	Kijja kumpi.
I think she must be his wife.	Ndowooza ateekwa okuba nga ye mukyala we.
Easy to say, hard to do.	Kyangu okwogera, kizibu okukola.
And this is probably true.	Era kino osanga kituufu.
I don’t want to tell anyone.	Saagala kubuulira muntu yenna.
Me and my father.	Nze ne taata.
Not all of it, but a lot of it.	Si byonna, naye bingi nnyo.
He is not ready.	Si mwetegefu.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
I have no idea why not, but you can’t.	Sirina kye mmanyi lwaki nedda naye ggwe tosobola.
What he didn’t know.	Kye yali tamanyi.
It’s just a problem.	Kizibu kyokka.
However, not just anyone can do this.	Kyokka, kino si muntu yenna yekka asobola okukikola.
Not consciously, no.	Si mu kumanya, nedda.
I know how hard it is.	Nkimanyi engeri gye kizibu.
Everyone knew, but no one saw.	Buli omu yali amanyi, naye nga tewali yalaba.
I am my own child.	Nze ndi mwana wange.
This is that .	Kino kiri nti .
It would be a place.	Kyandibadde kifo.
So are all of us.	Naffe ffenna bwe tuli.
That’s the idea.	Eyo ye ndowooza.
I was absolutely fine.	Nali bulungi ddala.
You have to answer this.	Kino olina okuddamu.
Now you're the one.	Kati gwe.
In your office.	Mu ofiisi yo.
I have to go back downstairs.	Nnina okudda wansi.
I guess we'll go tomorrow.	Ntebereza tujja kugenda enkya.
That he knew it all along.	Nti yali akimanyi buli kiseera.
That will come tomorrow.	Ekyo kijja kujja enkya.
Something you wanted.	Ekintu kye wali oyagala.
Thinking is everything.	Okulowooza kye kintu kyonna.
I always wondered that.	Ekyo bulijjo nnali nneebuuza.
It’s not easy at all.	Si kyangu n’akatono.
I'll just tell a little.	Nja kumala kubuulira katono.
Everyone is hopeful.	Buli omu alina essuubi.
It is only in the present moment .	Kiri mu kiseera kino kyokka .
We'll see!.	Tujja kulaba!.
It seems to be mine.	Kirabika kyange.
That's the house.	Eyo ennyumba.
This might work.	Kino kiyinza okukola.
We are moving forward.	Tugenda mu maaso.
He was there all the time.	Yali awo buli kiseera.
He goes shopping soon.	Agenda okugula amangu.
He will be fine.	Ajja kuba bulungi.
I didn’t even have it in the car.	Nze nali sirina wadde mu mmotoka.
It could be weeks.	Kiyinza okubeera wiiki.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
I don’t really care.	Sifaayo nnyo.
It is very important to address this.	Kikulu nnyo okukola ku kino.
He is good to be with.	Mulungi okubeera naye.
Now he had to go.	Kati yalina okugenda.
Every day, there is a plan.	Buli lunaku, waliwo enteekateeka.
You don’t even know how .	Tomanyi na ngeri ki .
This is on him.	Kino kiri ku ye.
It’s really easy.	Kyangu ddala.
That is my opinion.	Eyo ye ndowooza yange.
He was young, but he knew he was very sick.	Yali muto naye yali akimanyi nti mulwadde nnyo.
I just loved this so much.	Kino nnali njagala nnyo kyokka.
But now you are home.	Naye kati oli waka.
That’s what we all have to do.	Ekyo ffenna kye tulina okukola.
That may be the case here.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri wano.
Now we needed to do better.	Kati twali twetaaga okukola obulungi.
While it’s going on.	Nga kigenda mu maaso.
And it’s nobody’s business.	Era tewali nsonga ya muntu yenna.
Perhaps, that was the whole point.	Oboolyawo, eyo ye yali ensonga yonna.
This is not unusual at all.	Kino si kya bulijjo n’akatono.
I’m sure it will be good.	Nkakasa nti kijja kuba kirungi.
You will soon see that.	Mu bbanga ttono ojja kulaba ekyo.
I don’t really like it.	Njagala nnyo nedda.
My father is here.	Taata ali wano.
and everything else.	ne buli kimu.
He's more of a real guy.	Asinga kuba ggaayi ddala.
I wanted to talk to you though.	Nnali njagala okwogera naawe wadde.
He had me there.	Yalina nze eyo.
However, it is more complicated than it is, of course.	Kyokka, kizibu nnyo okusinga bwe kiri, ddala.
This is definitely something.	Kino mazima ddala kintu.
I was just a singer.	Nnali muyimbi yekka.
And he probably did.	Era oboolyawo yakikola.
He is my problem.	Ye kye kizibu kyange.
But you have a difficult problem.	Naye olina ekizibu ekizibu.
This doesn’t really matter much.	Kino si kikulu nnyo ddala.
He couldn’t tell what he was doing.	Yali tasobola kumanya kye yali akola.
This is a powerful concept.	Eno ndowooza ya maanyi.
He does this in many ways.	Kino akikola mu ngeri nnyingi.
Leaving the house	Okuva mu nnyumba .
And it really was just that.	Era ddala kyali ekyo kyokka.
This book is just one of many.	Ekitabo kino kye kimu kyokka ku bingi.
Now I am though.	Kati ndi wadde.
I’m too young for this thing.	Nze ndi muto nnyo ku kintu kino.
But there was no one there.	Naye nga tewali muntu yenna awo.
Now you know .	Kati omanyi .
I am very lucky.	Ndi wa mukisa nnyo.
Tomorrow, we’ll see.	Enkya, tujja kulaba.
In a sense, we were helpless.	Mu ngeri emu, twali tetulina kye tusobola kukola.
That would be a good point.	Eyo yandibadde nsonga nnungi.
But you don’t have to be alone.	Naye tolina kubeera wekka.
I’m just doing it.	Nze nkola kyokka.
This is not where he belonged.	Wano si we yali wa.
I can’t go with him.	Sisobola kugenda naye.
It’s time for me to move on from that, too.	Kye kiseera nze okugenda mu maaso okuva ku ekyo, nange.
Which he wasn’t going to get.	Kye yali tagenda kufuna.
I think he should have.	Ndowooza yandibadde alina.
It’s really quite simple.	Ddala kyangu nnyo.
That's me now.	Oyo nze kati.
I am the only one.	Nze nzekka nzekka.
I’ll do whatever you want.	Nja kukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
Pretty good, she thought.	Mulungi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
I can’t go back to my home.	Sisobola kudda waka wange.
It's going.	Kigenda.
This is actually happening.	Kino mu butuufu kigenda mu maaso.
As he knew he would.	Nga bwe yali akimanyi nti yandikoze.
He didn't want to say too much.	Yali tayagala kwogera bingi nnyo.
This is actually the case.	Kino mu butuufu bwe kiri.
He knew he should have.	Yali akimanyi nti yandibadde akola.
Perhaps we all are.	Oboolyawo ffenna bwe tuli.
I really really .	Nze ddala ddala .
Now he's coming.	Kati ajja.
This same thing is happening right now.	Kino kye kimu kigenda mu maaso mu kiseera kino.
No, you are not.	Nedda, ggwe si bwe kiri.
I think that’s probably a good and normal thing.	Ndowooza ekyo osanga kintu kirungi era kya bulijjo.
Really bad, actually.	Ddala kibi, mu butuufu.
But he isn’t.	Naye si bw’atyo.
But right now, he's afraid.	Naye mu kiseera kino, atya.
I have a friend there .	Nnina mukwano gwange eyo .
I’m not sure how or why.	Sikakasa ngeri ki oba lwaki.
It doesn’t matter to you.	Si kikulu gy’oli.
It wasn’t his room.	Si kye kyali kisenge kye.
Not so much for my father.	Si nnyo ku lwa taata.
And he was ready to go again.	Era yali mwetegefu okuddamu okugenda.
All alone in that room.	Byonna wekka mu kisenge ekyo.
I'll go with you.	Nja kugenda naawe.
Only you can know that.	Ekyo ggwe wekka asobola okumanya.
That’s important to me.	Ekyo kikulu gyendi.
In practice it is very difficult.	Mu nkola kizibu nnyo.
No one can do it alone.	Tewali asobola kukikola yekka.
He was here all the time.	Yali wano buli kiseera.
We don’t need anything.	Tetulina kye twetaaga.
No one seems to know what to do.	Alabika tewali amanyi kya kukola.
It’s what I love.	Kye kye njagala ennyo.
Everything is going to be fine here.	Buli kimu kigenda kubeera bulungi wano.
This was quickly getting worse.	Kino kyali kigenda kigenda kibi mangu.
I plan to continue with him.	Nteekateeka okugenda mu maaso naye.
I could have just been me.	Nnali nsobola okuba nze nzekka.
This is easy to do.	Kino kyangu okukikola.
That will always remain the case.	Ekyo kijja kusigala nga bwe kiri bulijjo.
There is no waiting time.	Tewali budde bwa kulinda.
Just about everything.	Kumpi buli kimu kyokka.
And he thinks about her.	Era alowooza ku ye.
This is going to be one of those.	Kino kigenda kuba kimu ku ebyo.
I am ready to buy.	Ndi mwetegefu okugula.
We probably can’t see each other.	Oboolyawo tetusobola kulaba buli omu.
And he is still in that position.	Era n’okutuusa kati akyali mu kifo ekyo.
I hope he does soon.	Nsuubira nti ajja kukikola mu bbanga ttono.
Everyone knows that.	Ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
I really needed a plan at this point.	Nnali nneetaaga nnyo enteekateeka mu kiseera kino.
And to the police.	Era eri poliisi.
I thought that was a really good movie.	Nalowooza nti eyo firimu nnungi ddala.
No one wanted to say anything.	Tewali yali ayagala kwogera kintu kyonna.
Here it is wrong.	Wano kibi.
Maybe everything was fine.	Mpozzi buli kimu kyali kirungi.
I know what they are.	Nze mmanyi kye bali.
You are everything.	Ggwe buli kimu.
I do .	Nkola .
You won’t get a penny.	Tojja kufuna ssente emu.
He is an ordinary person.	Ye muntu wa bulijjo.
He wasn’t happy with me.	Yali si musanyufu nange.
Happy everyone and everywhere.	Musanyufu buli muntu na buli wamu.
Now you know!.	Kati omanyi!.
It’s just the timing.	Kye kiseera kyokka.
I’m sure he’ll be fine.	Nkakasa nti ajja kuba bulungi.
It’s just what he is.	Kye kimu kyokka ky’ali.
You know what you want to do.	Omanyi ky’oyagala okukola.
And that was good.	Era ekyo kyali kirungi.
He was the one who loved food.	Ye yali ayagala ennyo emmere.
You today, me tomorrow.	Ggwe leero, nze enkya.
Beautiful but thoughtful.	Mulungi naye nga alowooza.
This is a bad idea in any case.	Kino kirowoozo kibi mu mbeera yonna.
And that it’s not all his business.	Era nti si nsonga ye yonna.
He goes down there.	Agenda wansi eyo.
And soon, you will be.	Era mu bbanga ttono, ojja kuba.
I don’t really care right now.	Mu butuufu sifaayo mu kiseera kino.
You can see my work below.	Osobola okulaba omulimu gwange wansi.
In your case, you were lucky.	Mu mbeera yo, wali wa mukisa.
I always wanted to do this.	Bulijjo nnali njagala okukola kino.
He was completely himself.	Yali ye kennyini ddala.
That’s not true.	Ekyo si kituufu.
Maybe everything would be fine.	Mpozzi buli kimu kyandibadde kirungi.
And that’s definitely not true.	Era ekyo mazima ddala si kituufu.
He is a teacher.	Ye musomesa.
No, not really .	Nedda, si ddala .
I think of my brother.	Ndowooza ku muganda wange.
Everything is here.	Buli kimu kiri wano.
No man has any form in him.	Tewali musajja alina ngeri yonna mu ye.
I am the knowledge.	Nze okumanya.
Happy weekend everyone.	Wiikendi ya mukisa buli omu.
He would do this.	Kino yandikoze.
I’m not the only one who thinks this.	Si nze nzekka alowooza ku kino.
I didn’t really want to.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala.
But it’s not the same.	Naye si kye kimu.
He certainly didn’t want much.	Mazima ddala yali tayagala nnyo.
They are dangerous.	Bali ba bulabe.
I thought it was a good idea.	Nalowooza nti kyali kirowoozo kirungi.
It's a movie.	Ye firimu.
That’s not an issue for us.	Eyo si nsonga gye tuli.
No one thought we were going anywhere.	Tewali yali alowooza nti twali tugenda yonna.
It will be something to do.	Kijja kuba kintu kya kukola.
He didn't want to talk.	Yali tayagala kwogera.
Not without knowing the acquisition process.	Si nga tolina kumanya nkola ya kufuna.
He works long hours.	Akola essaawa nnyingi.
I probably won’t be back until tomorrow morning.	Oboolyawo sijja kudda okutuusa enkya ku makya.
We can actually do better that this.	Mu butuufu tusobola okukola obulungi nti kino.
Maybe that’s what it is.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kiri.
I knew he would.	Nnali nkimanyi nti ajja kukikola.
He didn’t know anyone like him.	Yali tamanyi muntu nga ye.
It was time to act soon.	Kyali kiseera kya kukola mu bbanga ttono.
That’s obviously what anyone wants.	Ekyo kya lwatu nti omuntu yenna ayagala.
You should have come with me.	Wandibadde ojja nange.
The point is this.	Ensonga eri nti eno.
I guess not much.	Ntebereza si nnyo.
Almost no one does that.	Kumpi tewali akola ekyo.
What a guy he was.	Nga yali ggaayi.
He had been for hours.	Yali amaze essaawa nnyingi.
And you can win.	Era osobola okuwangula.
That’s all we need.	Ekyo kyokka kye twetaaga.
I think that would be good.	Ndowooza ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
I do and that’s all that matters.	Nkola era ekyo kyokka kye kikulu.
I don’t know how, really.	Simanyi ngeri ki, ddala.
I'm afraid too.	Nange ntya.
In fact, we can do all of that pretty well.	Mu butuufu, ebyo byonna tusobola bulungi nnyo.
It’s not something you couldn’t do yourself.	Si kintu kye wali tosobola kukola ggwe kennyini.
I’m not one of them.	Nze siri omu.
Of course, he said.	Kya lwatu, bwe yagambye.
It could have come today.	Kyandibadde kijja leero.
He loves to watch.	Ayagala nnyo okulaba.
I was probably lucky to have that.	Oboolyawo nnali wa mukisa okufuna ekyo.
And food is important.	Era emmere kikulu.
We’ll just have to see.	Tujja kumala kulaba.
We are all one now.	Ffenna tuli kimu kati.
For both of them, food did it.	Ku bombi, emmere ye yakikola.
At the hospital.	Ku ddwaaliro.
I was absolutely fine.	Nali bulungi ddala.
This is not difficult to do.	Kino si kizibu kukola.
Maybe this is actually real.	Mpozzi kino mu butuufu kya ddala.
I love my job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwange.
This was a good practice.	Eno yali nkola nnungi.
He will never do it again.	Tajja kuddamu kukikola.
That’s my practice.	Ekyo kye nkola yange.
Although not in the office.	Wadde nga si mu ofiisi.
The plan is pretty realistic.	Enteekateeka eno nnungi nnyo nga ya ddala.
It was time to get to work.	Kyali kiseera okutuuka ku mulimu.
No one expected much from us.	Tewali yali asuubira bingi okuva gye tuli.
He has the money.	Alina ssente.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka, kino si kituufu.
This may be just what he needed.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kye yali yeetaaga.
This was common at the time.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo mu kiseera ekyo.
I love movies.	Njagala nnyo firimu.
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
And, it’s really good.	Era, ddala kirungi.
Every day is dangerous.	Buli lunaku lwa bulabe.
He is happy to be with her.	Musanyufu okubeera naye.
Maybe he was asleep.	Mpozzi nga yeebase.
I know that very well.	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi nnyo.
Not really, as a matter of fact.	Si ddala, nga bwe kiri.
I’m fine now.	Nze ndi bulungi kati.
But it was just visible.	Naye nga kirabika kyokka.
For me maybe.	Ku nze mpozzi.
He said he could.	Yagamba nti ayinza.
But it’s not a problem.	Naye si kizibu.
Thus it is not at all.	Bw’atyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
I don't want to.	Saagala.
This is mine.	Kino kyange.
Do you know where it is? 	Omanyi gye kiri?
. . . .	.
I feel of there.	Mpulira ya eyo.
I've got it.	Nze nfunye.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
And we were together.	Era twali wamu.
He was very fast.	Yali wa bwangu nnyo.
I don’t like that, my friend.	Ekyo sikyagala mukwano gwange.
I’m not going to try that tonight.	Ekyo sigenda kugezaako ekiro kino.
It doesn’t matter if he knows or not.	Si kikulu oba amanyi oba nedda.
No one said he had.	Tewali yagamba nti yalina.
I was thinking only of myself.	Nali ndowooza ku nze nzekka.
He has a personality.	Alina omuntu.
This was definitely visible.	Kino kyali kirabika ddala.
We can’t do that.	Ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
But it was very difficult.	Naye kyali kizibu nnyo.
It’s a good thing, actually.	Kintu kirungi, mu butuufu.
You know how it is.	Omanyi bwe kiri.
But you might have .	Naye oyinza okuba nga olina .
In many ways, it’s good.	Mu ngeri nnyingi, kirungi.
It’s certainly not a problem.	Mazima ddala si kizibu.
It’s great to have you here.	Kirungi nnyo okubeera naawe wano.
But he is really very sick.	Naye ddala mulwadde nnyo.
I almost wish he wouldn’t.	Njagala kumpi nga tagenda.
I will always do it.	Bulijjo nja kukikola.
But for you that was awful.	Naye ggwe ekyo kyali kibi nnyo.
It will be costly.	Kijja kuba kya ssente nnyingi.
There are so many things we can do.	Waliwo ebintu bingi nnyo bye tusobola okukola.
He has to do it his way.	Alina okukikola mu ngeri ye.
I’m willing to do it.	Nze ndi mwetegefu okukikola.
I certainly think so.	Mazima ddala ndowooza bwe kiri.
Nothing is too complicated.	Tewali kizibu nnyo.
You would like to.	Wandyagadde.
It’s really great together.	Ddala kirungi nnyo nga tuli wamu.
He would have been very happy.	Yandibadde musanyufu nnyo.
I am happy to be here as well.	Ndi musanyufu okubeera wano nange.
It’s not a difficult thing.	Si kintu kizibu.
I know you can be good.	Nkimanyi nti osobola okubeera omulungi.
He appeared to be .	Yalabika nga .
Someone other than me will have to talk about it.	Omuntu okuggyako nze ajja kuba alina okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
It is a very serious issue.	Ensonga ya maanyi nnyo.
Something you really want.	Ekintu ky’oyagala ennyo.
He didn’t really need to.	Mu butuufu yali teyeetaaga.
It was just the way it was.	Kyali ngeri gye kyali kyokka.
This is both good and bad.	Kino kirungi era kibi.
I was very happy.	Nali musanyufu nnyo.
Definitely eloquent, of course.	Mazima ddala okwogera obulungi, ddala.
He didn't want to admit he was.	Yali tayagala kukkiriza nti yali.
But so far, so good.	Naye okutuuka wano, kirungi nnyo.
It’s so easy to say.	Kyangu nnyo okwogera.
He knew what that would be like.	Yali amanyi ekyo bwe kyandibadde.
Beat a little bit.	Kuba katono.
A lot, actually.	Bingi, mu butuufu.
Too easy, he thought.	Kyangu nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
I doubt anyone does.	Nbuusabuusa nti waliwo akola.
He comes face to face with himself.	Ajja maaso ku maaso naye kennyini.
And pretty good, too.	Era nga kirungi nnyo, naye.
I thought he wouldn’t answer.	Nalowooza nti tajja kuddamu.
He certainly had.	Mazima ddala yalina.
It seems to be true.	Kirabika kituufu.
And that he didn’t need to.	Era nti yali teyeetaaga.
I love that stuff.	Njagala nnyo ebintu ebyo.
That would be really bad.	Ekyo kyandibadde kibi ddala.
But he felt the same way.	Naye naye yawulira bw’atyo.
You know.	Omanyi.
You know me.	Omanyi nze.
Nothing too important.	Tewali kintu kyonna kikulu nnyo.
I could live there.	Nnali nsobola okubeera eyo.
Not that he knew why.	Si nti yali amanyi lwaki.
Nobody wanted to do that.	Ekyo tewali yali ayagala kukikola.
He told me it was mine.	Yang’amba nti yange.
She is terrified of being alone.	Atya nnyo okubeera yekka.
However, no, that is not true.	Kyokka, nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
I hope he doesn’t.	Nsuubira nti tajja kukikola.
Not to someone else.	Nedda eri omuntu omulala.
He was doing very well.	Yali akola bulungi nnyo.
He didn’t have to do anything he didn’t want to.	Yali talina kukola kintu kyonna kye yali tayagala.
He knew this would happen.	Yali akimanyi nti kino kijja kubaawo.
Daily .	Buli lunaku .
Strong but vulnerable.	Amaanyi naye nga mu bulabe.
I wanted to be like you.	Nnali njagala kubeera nga ggwe.
I didn’t know, of course.	Nnali simanyi, ddala.
He must be here now.	Ateekwa okuba wano kati.
We have to get out of this place.	Tulina okuva mu kifo kino.
Probably all of those things.	Oboolyawo ebintu ebyo byonna.
I can’t love anymore.	Sisobola kuddamu kwagala.
It was a dangerous place.	Kyali kifo kya bulabe.
My father did that.	Taata ekyo yakikola.
It is a serious problem.	Kizibu kya maanyi.
And you’re in luck.	Era oli mu mukisa.
He always seems so lonely.	Bulijjo alabika nga yekka nnyo.
Everything is normal.	Buli kimu kya bulijjo.
Lots of shopping as well.	Okugula ebintu bingi nga bwe kiri.
From here on out.	Okuva wano.
Not yourself right now.	Si ggwe kennyini mu kiseera kino.
Me too, probably.	Nze nange, oboolyawo.
He is very happy.	Musanyufu nnyo.
It’s easy to be alone.	Kyangu okubeera wekka.
It was really good.	Ddala kyali kirungi.
He certainly can’t do it.	Mazima ddala tasobola kukikola.
He told me there wasn’t.	Yang’amba nti tewali.
He had been alone.	Yali abadde yekka.
But something is happening here.	Naye wano waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
Very strong, but more than that.	Amaanyi nnyo, naye okusinga ekyo.
It will be much easier.	Kijja kuba kyangu nnyo.
He didn’t want that at all.	Ekyo yali tayagala n’akatono.
In theory, that’s true.	Mu ndowooza, ekyo kituufu.
It seems to me he can’t win.	Kirabika gyendi tasobola kuwangula.
If he wanted to see that picture, he would.	Singa yali ayagala okulaba ekifaananyi ekyo, yandibadde.
This is not quite true.	Kino si kituufu nnyo.
You have to get what you want.	Olina okufuna ky'oyagala.
But you won’t have anything.	Naye tojja kuba na kintu kyonna.
He is an ordinary person.	Ye muntu wa bulijjo.
And he was with her.	Era yali naye.
But he is happy.	Naye musanyufu.
And that's the point really.	Era eyo y'ensonga ddala.
He had the time.	Yalina obudde.
Whatever he wanted, it would have to wait.	Kyonna kye yali ayagala, kyandibadde kigenda kulinda.
I'm sorry about my father.	Nsonyiwa ku taata wange.
I really hope she’s okay.	Nsuubira ddala nti ajja kuba bulungi.
That goes for all of us.	Ekyo kigenda gye tuli ffenna.
Things he wanted to do.	Ebintu bye yali ayagala akole.
We have, he said.	Tulina, bwe yagambye.
However, that can be a challenge.	Kyokka, ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
He doesn’t want to do it.	Ye tayagala kukikola.
He would have to get a car.	Yandibadde alina okufuna mmotoka.
I’ve always loved it.	Bulijjo mbadde njagala nnyo.
He had been here before.	Yali abadde wano emabegako.
I know this better than anyone else.	Kino nkimanyi okusinga omuntu omulala yenna.
He loved the power.	Yali ayagala nnyo amaanyi.
He was a good man in every way.	Yali musajja mulungi mu buli ngeri.
No, the guy was asleep.	Nedda, ggaayi yali yeebase.
I don’t know what it was either.	Nange simanyi kye kyali.
I have been in that position too.	Nze nange mbadde mu kifo ekyo.
You have to step back.	Olina okudda emabega.
He doesn't know why.	Tamanyi lwaki.
Not that he thought it would.	Si nti yali alowooza nti kijja kubaawo.
He had to go in the car.	Yalina okugenda mu mmotoka.
And it was very difficult.	Era kyali kizibu nnyo.
There is you and me.	Waliwo nze naawe.
You have it too!.	Naawe olina!.
I am indeed very sorry.	Mazima ddala nsonyiwa nnyo.
He said he was happy to be my friend.	Yagambye nti musanyufu okubeera mukwano gwange.
I am not very dangerous.	Siri wa bulabe nnyo.
Something like this here.	Ekintu nga kino wano.
This was harder than he thought.	Kino kyali kizibu okusinga bwe yali alowooza.
No one has it.	Tewali alina.
I am not a doctor.	Nze siri musawo.
It’s easy to see why .	Kyangu okulaba lwaki .
I’m not involved.	Nze siri mu nsonga.
He was on time.	Yali mu budde.
In his job, he had to.	Mu mulimu gwe, yalina okukikola.
I wanted a boyfriend.	Nnali njagala muganzi.
It is probably very important.	Oboolyawo kikulu nnyo.
But no luck.	Naye nga tewali mukisa.
I feel good so far.	Mpulira bulungi okutuusa kati.
It will be very difficult.	Kijja kuba kizibu nnyo.
My father, too.	Taata naye.
It is much easier if you can do that.	Kyangu nnyo singa oba osobola okukola ekyo.
We are going to the city.	Tugenda mu kibuga.
He was young.	Yali muto.
I had no idea about it.	Nnali sirina ndowooza yonna ku nsonga eyo.
There is no answer.	Tewali kuddamu.
I have no issues now.	Sirina nsonga yonna kati.
I think there is.	Ndowooza nti waliwo.
I don’t want any trouble.	Saagala buzibu bwonna.
He couldn’t even speak.	Yali tasobola na kwogera.
Actually doing things.	Mu butuufu okukola ebintu.
That’s neither here nor there.	Ekyo si wano wadde awo.
He is a good singer.	Muyimbi mulungi.
I'm going to agree.	Nze ngenda kukkiriza.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
And the bottom is fine with me.	Era eri wansi ali bulungi gyendi.
It had to happen, of course.	Kyalina okubaawo, ddala.
I had no idea what to eat tonight.	Nali sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kya kulya ekiro kino.
Perhaps he knew it.	Oboolyawo yali akimanyi.
It’s not too difficult.	Si kizibu nnyo.
She knew she had to go back to her room.	Yali akimanyi nti alina okudda mu kisenge kye.
He didn’t need to know anything.	Yali teyeetaaga kumanya kintu kyonna.
Now it was on the ceiling.	Kati kyali ku kisenge.
It is true and correct.	Kituufu era kituufu.
I’m here for help.	Nze ndi wano nsaba obuyambi.
There is no feeling whatsoever.	Tewali mpulira yonna.
That's that, he thought.	Ekyo kye ekyo, bwe yalowooza.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
Most probably not anytime soon.	Okusinga osanga si mu bbanga ttono.
It is completely up to you.	Kiri gyoli ddala.
I feel powerful.	Mpulira nga nnina amaanyi.
I hope to be here today.	Nsuubira okubeera wano leero.
He has a reason.	Alina ensonga.
He is very friendly.	Alina mukwano nnyo.
No, it isn’t.	Nedda, si bwe kiri.
Now, you can do whatever you want.	Kati, osobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
It’s certainly not too complicated.	Mazima ddala si kizibu nnyo.
Now for this point.	Kati ku nsonga eno.
But he didn’t need to do that.	Naye ekyo yali teyeetaaga kukikola.
He was a good singer, and fast.	Yali muyimbi mulungi, era nga wa bwangu.
But that, of course, is not the thing.	Naye ekyo, kya lwatu, si kye kintu.
He didn't know what to say.	Yali tamanyi kya kwogera.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
Maybe that’s not so bad.	Mpozzi ekyo si kibi nnyo.
No one seems to have moved on.	Tewali alabika yagenda mu maaso.
He didn't want to say anything.	Yali tayagala kwogera kintu kyonna.
Actually, that would be great.	Mu butuufu, ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
You are very good at this.	Oli mulungi nnyo ku kino.
It was really easy.	Kyali kyangu ddala.
Not where we need it yet.	Nedda we twetaaga n’okutuusa kati.
I still don’t know anything about him.	N’okutuusa kati sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
No response from them.	Tewali kuddamu okuva gye bali.
But that wasn’t the point.	Naye eyo si ye yali ensonga.
I have the same problem right now.	Nze nnina ekizibu kye kimu kati kati.
That’s a good plan.	Eyo nteekateeka nnungi.
I love that at the time.	Njagala nnyo ekyo mu kiseera ekyo.
Not in the car.	Si mu mmotoka.
He works hard.	Akola nnyo.
There is there to be help.	Waliwo okubaawo obuyambi.
I’m sick of it.	Nze ndi mulwadde.
We have to move forward.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso.
It's not your party.	Si mbaga yo.
There, now you know.	Eyo, kati omanyi.
Not at all like me.	Si n’akatono nga nze.
That’s true, he said.	Ekyo kituufu, bwe yagambye.
I am always very.	Bulijjo mbeera nnyo.
You would love it though.	Wandyagadde nnyo wadde.
That’s certainly it.	Ekyo mazima ddala.
It’s a good idea.	Kirowoozo kirungi.
Not really good.	Si ddala kirungi.
But he did something.	Naye yakola ekintu.
For a moment, he considers the idea.	Okumala akaseera, alowooza ku ndowooza eyo.
He was to leave in the morning.	Yali wa kugenda ku makya.
But this was not the point.	Naye eno si ye yali ensonga.
He wasn’t happy though.	Yali si musanyufu wadde.
Only you can do that.	Ekyo ggwe wekka asobola okukikola.
He couldn’t do that.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
He had been a child.	Yali abadde mwana muto.
There was nothing he could do about that, either.	Tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku ekyo, era.
He has to get out of here, he thought.	Alina okuva wano, bwe yalowooza.
I'm going to move on.	Nze ngenda mu maaso.
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
He's such a normal guy.	Ye ggaayi wa bulijjo bw'atyo.
I actually thought.	Mu butuufu nnalowooza.
Maybe he'll be here tonight.	Mpozzi ajja kuba wano ekiro kino.
I'll come with you.	Nja kujja naawe.
I can go.	Nsobola okugenda.
He was sick.	Yali mulwadde.
You’re there but you’re not there.	Oli awo naye toli awo.
In a sense, of course.	Mu ngeri emu, mazima ddala.
No, he’s not alone.	Nedda, si yekka.
But this isn’t acting.	Naye kino si kuzannya.
But no one does.	Naye tewali akola.
I said almost.	Nagamba kumpi.
Not all that well.	Si byonna nti bulungi.
And we can’t.	Era tetusobola.
We can talk there.	Tusobola okwogera eyo.
I wonder exactly where this could go.	Nze nneebuuza ddala kino gye kiyinza okugenda.
I couldn’t even speak.	Nnali sisobola na kwogera.
This is not true for everyone but it is common.	Kino si bwe kiri ku buli muntu naye kya bulijjo.
He said he couldn’t.	Yagambye nti tasobola.
I’m not really interested in doing anything right now.	Mu butuufu sifaayo kukola kintu kyonna mu kiseera kino.
That wasn’t my point.	Ekyo si kye kyali ensonga yange.
We can all do that.	Ekyo ffenna tusobola okukikola.
You can’t tell.	Tosobola kumanya.
I'm glad we don't have to.	Ndi musanyufu nti tetulina kukikola.
He knew that too.	Ekyo naye yali akimanyi.
He went home to his room.	Yagenda awaka mu kisenge kye.
There was no one he didn’t like.	Tewali muntu yenna gwe yali tayagala.
I was behind him.	Nze nnali emabega we.
I didn’t even know.	Nze na simanyi.
I have nothing to ask for right now.	Sirina kye nsaba mu kiseera kino.
Now you are ready to draw!.	Kati oli mwetegefu okukuba ekifaananyi!.
It’s hard for you and me to see.	Kizibu nze naawe okulaba.
He shouldn’t have been alone.	Yali tasaanidde kubeera yekka.
This is much more important than that.	Kino kikulu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
And it was good that he came.	Era kyali kirungi nti yajja.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
I was an ordinary child.	Nnali mwana wa bulijjo.
Not well at all .	Si bulungi n'akatono .
You won’t believe much.	Tojja kukkiriza nnyo.
That’s what the guy did.	Ekyo ggaayi kye yakola.
That's the same thing.	Ekyo ekintu kye kimu.
You can see it.	Oyinza okulaba.
either.	oba.
He seemed to be doing the same thing.	Yalabika ng’akola ekintu kye kimu.
And it’s dangerous.	Era kya bulabe.
He is not ordinary to us.	Si wa bulijjo ku ffe.
He always knew where it was.	Bulijjo yali amanyi gye kyali.
And it was really easy.	Era ddala kyali kyangu.
This is where the problem lies.	Wano obuzibu we buli.
It was truth quickly.	Yali mazima amangu.
I live here alone.	Mbeera wano nzekka.
Either way, it would be awful.	Mu ngeri yonna, kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
Or last week.	Oba wiiki ewedde.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
Or, back to the police.	Oba, okudda ku poliisi.
It’s not for everyone.	Si kya buli muntu.
We were friends at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo twali ba mukwano.
The food is excellent.	Emmere nnungi nnyo.
But he was very well.	Naye yali bulungi nnyo.
It doesn’t matter now.	Si kikulu kati.
Lucky to be with him.	Omukisa okubeera naye.
And you, along with him.	Naawe, wamu naye.
My friend .	Mukwano gwange .
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
He could buy what he needed.	Yali asobola okugula kye yali yeetaaga.
He is mine	Ye wange .
However, it can achieve the same thing.	Kyokka, kiyinza okutuuka ku kintu kye kimu.
Very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo, kirungi nnyo.
Every day for a while.	Buli lunaku okumala akaseera.
I've been good.	Mbadde mulungi.
For a long time, that was fine.	Okumala ebbanga ddene, ekyo kyali kirungi.
I'll come with you.	Nja kujja naawe.
This is true until we need to redraw.	Kino kituufu okutuusa lwe twetaaga okuddamu okukuba ekifaananyi.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
I’m pretty good, actually.	Nze ndi bulungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
I’m that, too.	Nze ekyo, nange.
That was what he was doing.	Ekyo yali akikola.
He knew that too.	Ekyo naye yali akimanyi.
He’s not here, though .	Tali wano, naye .
I was a little nervous, though.	Kyokka nnali ntya katono.
This is what we have.	Kino kye tulina.
But he was ready.	Naye yali mwetegefu.
But not like me.	Naye si nga nze.
It was all he could do.	Kye kyokka kye yali asobola okukola.
He advanced towards me.	Yagenda mu maaso gye ndi.
It looked like that, but it wasn’t.	Yalabika ng’ekyo, naye nga si bwe kiri.
And for everyone else.	Era ku buli muntu omulala.
He can do anything at all.	Asobola okukola ekintu kyonna n’akatono.
He was nothing of the sort.	Yali si kintu kya ngeri eyo.
I mostly do.	Nze okusinga nkola.
Very good indeed.	Kirungi nnyo ddala.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
Nobody comes here.	Tewali ajja wano.
Every artist does.	Buli muyimbi akola.
This was a serious problem.	Kino kyali kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
How difficult it is!.	Nga kizibu nnyo!.
This can be a problem.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
He started working.	Yatandika okukola...
He's still not ready.	N'okutuusa kati si mwetegefu.
Certainly we are.	Mazima ddala ffe tuli.
We always have.	Bulijjo tulina.
You are so lucky.	Oli wa mukisa nnyo.
I'm still not so sure.	Nze n'okutuusa kati sikakasa nnyo.
You might say that he	Oyinza okugamba nti ye .
But only one.	Naye omu yekka.
He told me that himself.	Ekyo ye kennyini yangamba.
And he knew what she looked like.	Era yali amanyi engeri gye yali alabika.
I am not home at the moment.	Siri waka mu kiseera kino.
But it’s not that.	Naye si ekyo.
Now it’s good.	Kati kirungi.
You can go ahead.	Oyinza okugenda mu maaso.
No real place, really.	Tewali kifo kya ddala, ddala.
He was asleep.	Yali yeebase.
He didn’t think, but above all he was young.	Yali talowooza, naye okusinga byonna yali muto.
That’s dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe.
He is with her now.	Ali naye kati.
I don’t want to wait until tomorrow.	Saagala kulinda okutuusa enkya.
No one could believe it, no one.	Tewali yali asobola kukkiriza, tewali muntu yenna.
They were lucky, of course.	Baali ba mukisa, ddala.
I wanted everything immediately.	Nnali njagala buli kimu mu bwangu.
But he will have trouble talking.	Naye ajja kufuna obuzibu okwogera.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
Or why it was.	Oba lwaki bwe kyali.
That, in fact, is up to you.	Ekyo, mu butuufu, kiri gy’oli.
That is the crux of the matter.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo mu nsonga.
In any case.	Mu ngeri yonna.
But the thing is .	Naye ekintu kiri nti .
I feel at home there.	Mpulira nga ndi waka eyo.
He had no plans for this.	Kino yali talina nteekateeka yonna.
I was then alone, alone.	Nali mu kiseera ekyo nzekka, nze nzekka.
And he is not very strong.	Era si wa maanyi nnyo.
It was a good time to think.	Kyali kiseera kirungi okulowooza.
Not that it really mattered, really.	Si nti ddala kyali kikulu, ddala.
You will be happy with him.	Ojja kuba musanyufu naye.
Maybe he’s a kid now.	Mpozzi nga kati mwana muto.
This is good for you.	Kino kirungi gy’oli.
But it’s not that for me.	Naye si ekyo gyendi.
Ya can't do it.	Ya tasobola kukikola.
He knows now.	Amanyi kati.
I only ask for one thing in return.	Nze nsaba ekintu kimu kyokka mu kuddamu.
The phone worked.	Essimu yakola.
It can work.	Kiyinza okukola.
We need to go.	Twetaaga okugenda.
And soon it won’t be .	Era mu bbanga ttono tekijja kuba .
It comes in this form.	Kijja mu ngeri eno.
You think only of yourself.	Olowooza ku ggwe wekka.
You said earlier.	Wagamba emabegako.
He has always been strong there.	Bulijjo abadde wa maanyi eyo.
Why is this happening.	Lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso.
That's what it is	Ekyo kye kiri .
How do you know? 	Omanyi otya?
He wasn’t like us.	Yali si nga ffe.
That was .	Ekyo kyali .
I had no idea how this could happen.	Kino nnali simanyi ngeri gye kiyinza kubaawo.
That’s for my wife.	Ekyo kya mukyala wange.
Not too bad now.	Si kibi nnyo kati.
I don’t know why though.	Simanyi lwaki wadde.
I think we’re fine now.	Ndowooza kati tuli bulungi.
It’s really great for me.	Mazima ddala kirungi nnyo gyendi.
You know why.	Omanyi lwaki.
We were all very close.	Ffenna twali ba mukwano nnyo.
That is a serious problem.	Ekyo kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika nga mulungi nnyo.
It won’t be a problem.	Tekijja kuba kizibu.
He had to do this.	Kino yalina okukikola.
He had something very difficult.	Yalina ekintu ekizibu ennyo.
He didn’t know what to do or say.	Yali tamanyi kya kukola oba kya kwogera.
You know it all too well.	Okimanyi bulungi nnyo.
He says he loves doing it.	Agamba nti ayagala nnyo okukikola.
Now you are like me.	Kati oli nga nze.
Just like he had a week ago.	Nga bwe yalina wiiki emu emabega.
However, you are in luck.	Kyokka oli mu mukisa.
I knew one thing though.	Nali mmanyi ekintu kimu wadde.
However, this is not a common problem.	Kyokka, kino si kizibu kya bulijjo.
I can’t go to the party.	Sisobola kugenda ku kabaga.
No one knows yet.	Tewali akimanyi n’okutuusa kati.
They were dangerous.	Baali ba bulabe.
He .	Ye .
I’m not for that.	Nze siri lwa ekyo.
It’s very difficult for me.	Kizibu nnyo gyendi.
Really, he shouldn’t.	Ddala, tasaanidde kukikola.
Excellent work.	Omulimu mulungi nnyo.
I want to be good.	Njagala kubeera mulungi.
But he wasn’t going to do it.	Naye yali tagenda kukikola.
He felt so much better now.	Yawulira bulungi nnyo kati.
There is something .	Waliwo ekintu .
Or, of course, he would.	Oba, ddala, yandibadde akola.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
And apparently not.	Era kirabika si bwe kiri.
He knew it wouldn’t be enough.	Yali akimanyi nti tekijja kumala.
There is only one of me.	Waliwo omu yekka ku nze.
His brother was there.	Muganda we yali awo.
And it won’t happen.	Era tekijja kubaawo.
To perform well.	Okukola obulungi.
He would have to read the book again.	Yandibadde alina okuddamu okusoma ekitabo ekyo.
He was nothing.	Yali si kintu kyonna.
He was coming.	Yali ajja.
Maybe this is what he foresaw.	Mpozzi kino kye yalaba nga bukyali.
I think that’s true.	Ndowooza ekyo kituufu.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
It must have been him.	Ateekwa okuba nga ye yali.
It’s just a room.	Kisenge kyokka.
It’s going to be difficult.	Kigenda kuba kizibu.
You would have to be there.	Wandibadde olina okuba nga oli awo.
How could he not.	Yali tasobola atya.
We will have to talk to him.	Tujja kuba tulina okwogera naye.
I don’t know how many in advance.	Simanyi mmeka nga bukyali.
That you	Nti ggwe .
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
This is a time for action.	Kino kiseera kya kukola.
And he’s not alone in this sentiment.	Era si ye yekka mu ndowooza eno.
He couldn’t do that.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
It is very important to us.	Kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
He could have been anyone.	Yali asobola okuba omuntu yenna.
But the picture won’t be even.	Naye ekifaananyi tekijja kuba kya wadde.
That would be me.	Oyo yandibadde nze.
I have to know everything.	Nnina okumanya buli kimu.
And now he was here.	Era kati yali wano.
No one is in sight.	Tewali muntu yenna alabika.
I know how difficult it is.	Nkimanyi nti kizibu nnyo.
That's not what this is at all.	Ekyo kino si kye kiri n'akatono.
I wish he wouldn’t.	Njagala tajja kukikola.
But it’s really much more complicated than that.	Naye ddala kizibu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I really said that.	Nze ddala nagamba nti.
I’m sure you can think of a reason.	Nkakasa nti osobola okulowooza ku nsonga.
This was just a normal thing.	Kino kyali kintu kya bulijjo kyokka.
He had it as bad, too.	Yalina nga kibi, naye.
I feel forgiven.	Mpulira nga nsonyiwa.
He wanted to be the best.	Yali ayagala kubeera asinga.
He is still only a man.	Akyali musajja yekka.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
I don’t know what to do.	Nze simanyi kya kukola.
You don’t have anyone.	Tolina muntu.
I wanted to talk to you.	Nnali njagala okwogera naawe.
It looks something like this.	Kirabika ekintu nga kino.
Not in the way he had feared.	Si mu ngeri gye yali abadde atya.
It could be him.	Kiyinza okuba nga ye.
He was a real man.	Yali musajja ddala.
I am so glad he is here today.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti ali wano leero.
I could have helped.	Nnali nsobola okuyamba.
I really don’t know what to say about it.	Mu butuufu simanyi kya kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
He certainly is.	Mazima ddala ye bw’atyo.
In a way, it was.	Mu ngeri emu, bwe kyali.
And, mostly, it was luck.	Era, okusinga, kyali kya mukisa.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
I wanted to come.	Nnali njagala kujja.
But it is not common.	Naye si kya bulijjo.
It was a really beautiful place.	Ddala kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
It was a purchase.	Yali ya kugula.
I was well aware of that.	Ekyo nnali nkimanyi bulungi.
What is that about .	Ekyo kiri ki ku .
But he was in good shape.	Naye yali mu mbeera nnungi.
He was trying to do the father thing.	Yali agezaako okukola ekintu kya taata.
He is the one.	Ye omu.
Can't wait to stay again.	Siyinza kulinda kuddamu kusigala.
He has this.	Alina kino.
Now he was coming.	Kati yali ajja.
Now it was as good a time as ever.	Kati kyali kiseera kirungi nga buli kiseera.
He is not a job.	Ye si mulimu.
He doesn’t have anyone.	Talina muntu yenna.
I deserved it, apparently.	Nnali nsaanidde, kirabika.
He went to his room.	Yagenda mu kisenge kye.
This is a powerful one.	Kino kya maanyi.
It’s a matter of opinion, of course.	Ensonga ya ndowooza, ddala.
However, he was young.	Kyokka yali muto.
That was certainly true.	Mazima ddala ekyo kyali kituufu.
We need to read.	Twetaaga okusoma.
We were at a party.	Twali ku mbaga.
The guy is the guy.	Ggaayi ye ggaayi.
And none at the same time.	Era tewali mu kiseera kye kimu.
He loves this very much.	Kino ayagala nnyo.
Nothing really to say.	Tewali kintu kyonna ddala kya kwogera.
But it was too close now.	Naye kyali kumpi nnyo kati.
I'm sure.	Nkakasa.
This isn’t exactly a bad thing.	Kino si kintu kibi ddala.
You don’t want to respond too quickly.	Toyagala kuddamu mu bwangu nnyo.
That's why he won't.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki tajja kukikola.
We'll go, tomorrow.	Tujja kugenda, enkya.
And, in a way, it was.	Era, mu ngeri emu, bwe kyali.
And he knew he wanted to.	Era yali akimanyi nti yali ayagala.
But it was .	Naye kyali .
This is a fact.	Kino kituufu.
You are lucky.	Oli wa mukisa.
Actually, he did, but it was bad.	Mu butuufu, yakikola naye kyali kibi.
That was pretty easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo.
She loves her dogs.	Ayagala nnyo embwa ze.
It’s going to be good.	Kigenda kuba kirungi.
He is not at home.	Tali waka.
To say the least.	Okugamba nti kyangu.
A friend of mine did.	Mukwano gwange omu yakikola.
The best of the best.	Asinga obulungi.
Maybe it’s nothing, but .	Mpozzi nga si kintu kyonna, naye .
I want to go home.	Njagala kudda waka.
To be nothing at all.	Okubeera nga tewali kintu kyonna.
This is what was happening.	Kino kye kyali kigenda mu maaso.
At the time, it was fine.	Mu kiseera ekyo, kyali kirungi.
No one wanted his job.	Tewali yali ayagala mulimu gwe.
But his younger brother	Naye muto we .
I’m pretty sure about that.	Nze nkakasa nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
Nothing important, just a little bit.	Tewali kikulu, katono ddala.
That is not the truth.	Ekyo si kye kituufu.
He is at this position.	Ali ku kifo kino.
There’s a lot here.	Wano waliwo bingi.
It would be dangerous, he knew.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe, yali akimanyi.
Now he thinks he won’t win.	Kati alowooza nti tajja kuwangula.
It’s the car.	Ye mmotoka.
He won’t be here until tomorrow.	Tajja kubeera wano okutuusa enkya.
He does everything and does everything well.	Buli kimu akikola era buli kimu akikola bulungi.
What everyone said about the person.	Buli omu kye yayogera ku muntu oyo.
He knew how to win.	Yali amanyi okuwangula.
Here when he thought that .	Wano bwe yalowooza nti .
He will be ready.	Ajja kuba mwetegefu.
But no one tried to do it.	Naye tewali yagezaako kukikola.
You can’t even tell if anyone is home or not.	Tosobola na kumanya oba waliwo omuntu yenna awaka oba nedda.
It was very dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
I won’t be like my father.	Sijja kuba nga taata.
It’s an easy thing to do.	Kintu kyangu okukola.
That could easily happen again.	Ekyo kyali kyangu okuddamu okubaawo.
He didn’t know what he had here.	Yali tamanyi kye yalina wano.
Maybe you didn’t know.	Mpozzi nga wali tomanyi.
I feel like a father here.	Mpulira nga taata wano.
Maybe it’s nothing.	Mpozzi nga si kintu kyonna.
That was great, that was great.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo, ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
He shouldn’t do that.	Ekyo tasaanidde kukikola.
I can’t say more than that.	Siyinza kwogera okusinga awo.
This is what I’ve been wanting.	Kino kye mbadde njagala.
Until you don’t have it.	Okutuusa nga tolina.
It's true it's true it's true.	Kituufu kituufu kituufu.
He could read that.	Ekyo yali asobola okusoma.
That was certainly the plan.	Mazima ddala eyo ye yali enteekateeka.
I am now in the hospital.	Kati ndi mu ddwaaliro.
We are in the city.	Tuli mu kibuga.
However, this will not happen in practice.	Kyokka kino tekijja kubaawo mu nkola.
This is all I have.	Nze kino kyokka kye nnina.
Always thinking ahead.	Bulijjo okulowooza mu maaso.
He didn’t want to tell the truth.	Yali tayagala kwogera mazima.
I want to be comfortable.	Njagala kubeera bulungi.
I don’t know if we have a chance.	Simanyi oba tulina omukisa.
No one knew where he went.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yagenda.
That is certainly true.	Ekyo mazima ddala kituufu.
But the point wasn’t to stay.	Naye ensonga yali si kusigala.
And that was one thing.	Era ekyo kyali kimu.
In fact, she looks great.	Mu butuufu, alabika bulungi nnyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
He was going to do it.	Yali agenda kukikola.
He spoke the truth.	Yayogera mu mazima.
He had been here before.	Yali abadde wano emabegako.
This is what we were.	Kino kye twali ffe.
But that’s not the same thing.	Naye ekyo si kye kimu.
You don’t know at all.	Tomanyi n’akatono.
But from there, it’s not bad at all.	Naye okuva awo, si kibi n’akatono.
Nobody told me that before.	Ekyo tewali yang’amba emabegako.
It won’t be too dangerous.	Tekijja kuba kya bulabe nnyo.
Until the fact .	Okutuusa nga ensonga .
But why won’t he come? 	Naye lwaki tajja kujja?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
I have three.	Nnina ssatu.
Now we can.	Kati tusobola.
But there is a reason why.	Naye waliwo ensonga lwaki.
You are not really mine.	Ggwe toli wange ddala.
You probably won’t get anything anyway.	Oboolyawo tojja kufuna kintu kyonna mu ngeri yonna.
Now and always.	Kati era bulijjo.
He had no reason to do this.	Yali talina nsonga lwaki akola kino.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
It is very bad for us.	Kibi nnyo gye tuli.
I have to go.	Nnina okugenda.
Maybe he had a phone.	Mpozzi yalina essimu.
The problem is that .	Obuzibu buli nti .
But, that is not the case.	Naye, ekyo si bwe kiri.
It would be easier that way.	Kyandibadde kyangu mu ngeri eyo.
And we are alone.	Era tuli ffekka.
He was going to go.	Yali agenda kugenda.
This is worse than anything.	Kino kibi okusinga ekintu kyonna.
But he was very popular.	Naye yali muganzi nnyo.
I think very soon.	Ndowooza mu bbanga ttono ddala.
Apparently my guy went as usual.	Kirabika ggaayi wange yagenda nga bulijjo.
He was the one who had it.	Ye yali alina.
I think that’s dangerous.	Ndowooza ekyo kya bulabe.
You can’t do that again.	Ekyo tosobola kuddamu kukikola.
Nothing was going to be okay.	Tewali kyali kigenda kuba bulungi.
What was he supposed to do with this.	Kino yali alina okukola ki.
You could be me.	Oyinza okuba nze.
This is an immediate problem.	Kino kizibu kya mangu.
He is very beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo.
You said that’s a terrible idea.	Wagamba nti ekyo kirowoozo kibi nnyo.
What he should have said.	Kye yandibadde ayogera.
I was in prison.	Nnali mu kkomera.
But you do it.	Naye ggwe okola.
In fact, this is almost certainly not the case.	Mu butuufu, kino kumpi si bwe kiri.
He does the same thing.	Akola kye kimu.
I wish he had known.	Njagala nnyo singa yali akimanyi.
Maybe you know .	Mpozzi omanyi .
I am actually a man.	Mu butuufu ndi musajja.
Very nice house.	Ennyumba nnungi nnyo.
Perhaps he knew that.	Oboolyawo ekyo yali akimanyi.
And it’s also not hard to see why.	Era era si kizibu kulaba lwaki.
You might say no.	Oyinza okugamba nti nedda.
You have to move on.	Olina okugenda mu maaso.
He is a romantic girlfriend.	Ye muganzi wa mukwano.
Lots of help.	Obuyambi bungi.
I am happy to do that.	Ndi musanyufu okukola ekyo.
He didn't know what it was.	Yali tamanyi kiki.
Apparently it is.	Kirabika bwe kiri.
That is happening very quickly.	Ekyo kigenda mu maaso mu bwangu ddala.
He knows where it is.	Amanyi gye kiri.
That was too fast.	Ekyo kyali kya bwangu nnyo.
He was my everything.	Ye yali buli kimu kyange.
I hope you’ll play with him.	Nsuubira nti ojja kuzannya naye.
But we have to do it right.	Naye tulina okukikola obulungi.
It’s not a problem at all.	Si kizibu n’akatono.
You will never be alone again.	Tojja kuddamu kubeera wekka.
However, this is very difficult.	Kyokka kino kizibu nnyo.
This would be very important.	Kino kyandibadde kikulu nnyo.
It’s not a wedding day.	Si lunaku lwa mbaga.
It certainly isn’t.	Mazima si ye.
Still pretty good, though.	Akyali kirungi nnyo, wadde.
It will happen in time.	Kijja kubaawo mu budde.
But he had been good.	Naye yali abadde mulungi.
And we can go anytime.	Era tusobola okugenda essaawa yonna.
Maybe nothing is happening.	Mpozzi tewali kigenda mu maaso.
But who knows.	Naye ani amanyi.
I only have this one book now.	Nnina ekitabo kino kimu kyokka kati.
I know how to do that.	Ekyo nkimanyi okukikola.
However, it is not the same thing.	Kyokka, si kintu kye kimu.
We have a very good chance.	Tulina omukisa omulungi ennyo.
No, rather than going.	Nedda, okusinga okugenda.
He couldn’t do that.	Ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
You know all, that stuff.	Omanyi byonna, ebintu ebyo.
I have my own job.	Nnina omulimu gwange.
He has had a lot.	Abadde alina bingi.
I wasn’t very good at it either.	Nange nnali simanyi bulungi nnyo mu nsonga eyo.
My father didn’t know what to do.	Taata yali tamanyi kya kukola.
And he knew it too.	Era naye yali akimanyi.
Everyone who knows anything knows that.	Buli amanyi ekintu kyonna ekyo akimanyi.
I could actually go to the police about it.	Mu butuufu nnali nsobola okugenda ku poliisi ku nsonga eyo.
I want to do that immediately.	Ekyo njagala kukikola mu bwangu.
He told me he needed one.	Yang’amba nti yeetaaga emu.
He can’t go to work.	Tasobola kugenda ku mulimu.
This is not true here.	Kino si kituufu wano.
That’s what they’re there for.	Ekyo kye bali eyo.
Probably pretty good.	Oboolyawo nga kirungi nnyo.
I need to talk to you, urgently.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe, mu bwangu.
But in the meantime.	Naye mu kiseera kino.
But now you know.	Naye kati omanyi.
It had to be tonight.	Kyalina okuba ekiro kino.
Living here already was dangerous.	Okubeera wano dda kyali kya bulabe.
You certainly do.	Mazima ddala okola.
It was just a romantic thing.	Kyali kintu kya mukwano kyokka.
This is a job.	Guno mulimu.
That was a bad idea.	Ekyo kyali kirowoozo kibi.
In reality this is not the case.	Mu butuufu kino si bwe kiri.
It’s not like, soon or anything.	Si nga, mu bbanga ttono oba ekintu kyonna.
That book was mine.	Ekitabo ekyo kyali kyange.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Era si kibi.
And here’s really the problem.	Era wano ddala ekizibu.
You’re going to be fine.	Ogenda kuba bulungi.
It’s really hard .	Ddala kizibu nnyo .
Only he can do anything with her.	Ye yekka asobola okukola ekintu kyonna naye.
I love working and have always loved working.	Njagala nnyo okukola era bulijjo njagala nnyo okukola.
He has plenty of time.	Alina obudde bungi.
That was good for us.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gye tuli.
I don’t even know what it is.	Nze simanyi na kiki kye kiri.
You have to do the same.	Naawe olina okukola kye kimu.
Almost too good.	Kumpi bulungi nnyo.
Everyone knew it.	Buli omu yali akimanyi.
He was local in the congregation.	Yali wa wano mu kibiina.
I don’t know how to do it.	Simanyi ngeri gye nkola.
He couldn’t come up with anything.	Yali tasobola kujja na kintu kyonna.
He says you can.	Agamba nti osobola.
But someone has to do it.	Naye waliwo alina okukikola.
They are in the air.	Bali mu bbanga.
Obviously, you have to.	Kya lwatu nti olina okukikola.
He would be strong.	Yandibadde wa maanyi.
I just wanted to do that.	Ekyo nnali njagala kukikola kyokka.
Maybe that’s why he left.	Mpozzi y’ensonga lwaki yagenda.
I can .	Nsobola .
Will get things done in the morning.	Ajja kukola ebintu ku makya.
Where it always was.	We kyali bulijjo.
It’s not mine.	Si kyange.
Maybe it doesn’t come to you.	Mpozzi tekijja ku ggwe.
I didn’t really know.	Mu butuufu nnali simanyi.
That's it, plain and simple.	Ekyo kye kiri, kya lwatu era kyangu.
Everyone wanted one.	Buli omu yali ayagala emu.
Everyone wants it.	Buli omu ayagala.
I need to be in the moment.	Nze nneetaaga okubeera mu kiseera kino.
No one knows this.	Kino tewali akimanyi.
He wants to be alone.	Ayagala kubeera yekka.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
He may not be the best friend.	Ayinza okuba nga si wa mukwano okusinga.
But that’s not for now.	Naye ekyo si kya kati.
Maybe he thought he was doing the right thing.	Mpozzi yalowooza nti akola kituufu.
I knew he knew it too.	Namanya nti naye yali akimanyi.
Is that right?.	Ekyo kituufu?.
It’s too bad for me.	Kibi nnyo gyendi.
But it was very common.	Naye kyali kya bulijjo nnyo.
It was everything he feared.	Kyali buli kimu kye yali atya.
I think it is, of course.	Ndowooza bwe kiri, ddala.
I'll try it tomorrow.	Nja kugezaako enkya.
I just want to do the right thing.	Njagala kukola kituufu kyokka.
Everyone loves to win.	Buli muntu ayagala nnyo okuwangula.
But he must act quickly.	Naye alina okukola amangu.
Apparently they actually are.	Kirabika mu butuufu bwe bali.
All this is me.	Bino byonna nze.
That’s nothing to me.	Ekyo si kintu gyendi.
I have been very lucky to find someone.	Mbadde wa mukisa nnyo okufuna omuntu.
You will probably see better than we can.	Oboolyawo ojja kulaba obulungi okusinga bwe tusobola.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
But it’s really great.	Naye ddala kirungi nnyo.
But not right now.	Naye si mu kiseera kino.
I'll do it.	Nja kukikola.
I don’t want to be alone right now.	Saagala kubeera nzekka mu kiseera kino.
You know it’s not.	Omanyi si bwe kiri.
We don’t have one.	Tetulina emu.
His money well.	Ssente ze bulungi.
I hope they are very well.	Nsuubira nti bali bulungi nnyo.
We definitely have to talk.	Mazima ddala tulina okwogera.
I will drive myself.	Nze kennyini nja kuvuga.
Today we are in exactly the same place.	Leero tuli mu kifo kye kimu ddala.
He is also my best friend and brother.	Era mukwano gwange nnyo era muganda wange.
I hope it’s true.	Nsuubira nti kituufu.
It would be good for me.	Kyandibadde kirungi gyendi.
We are so lucky to have him.	Tuli ba mukisa nnyo okubeera naye.
He was going to have to think clearly.	Yali agenda kuba alina okulowooza obulungi.
He does that.	Ekyo akikola.
To me, anyway.	Eri nze, mu ngeri yonna.
I?' 	Nze?'
It was home.	Yali waka.
He was definitely going to do this.	Kino ddala yali agenda kukikola.
You are my darling.	Ggwe muganzi wange.
It’s everyone’s phone.	Essimu ya buli muntu.
He is in excellent condition.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
I wanted to make money.	Nnali njagala kufuna ssente.
But we have a little time.	Naye tulina akaseera katono.
But that really doesn’t matter.	Naye ekyo ddala si kikulu.
I love stuff like that.	Njagala nnyo ebintu nga ebyo.
He is not alone at all.	Tali yekka n’akatono.
It’s not a problem.	Si kizibu.
But it’s not just this.	Naye si kino kyokka.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
But one has to move on.	Naye omuntu alina okugenda mu maaso.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
He was going too fast.	Yali agenda mangu nnyo.
And you don’t have to talk.	Era tolina kwogera.
My father is a doctor.	Taata wange musawo.
Leaving the room.	Okuva mu kisenge.
We’re going down quickly.	Tugenda wansi mangu.
Probably, but that’s not the point.	Oboolyawo, naye eyo si y’ensonga.
Maybe that will work.	Mpozzi ekyo kijja kukola.
I should have seen something.	Nnali nsaanidde okulaba ekintu.
There is also the police.	Mulimu ne poliisi.
It was a wonderful time.	Kyali kiseera kirungi nnyo.
That was the one.	Oyo ye yali.
But that’s not the problem.	Naye ekyo si kye kizibu.
It is very dangerous.	Kya bulabe nnyo.
That will be good for us.	Ekyo kijja kuba bulungi gye tuli.
Now it’s time to get to work.	Kati kye kiseera okutuuka ku mulimu.
Whatever he wants to do is fine.	Kyonna ky’ayagala okukola kiri bulungi.
It is much more important than that.	Kikulu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
I couldn’t stay in that room for long.	Mu kisenge ekyo nnali sisobola kumala bbanga ddene.
Or in any way.	Oba mu ngeri yonna.
It’s what he wants.	Ye ky’ayagala.
But everyone saw it.	Naye buli omu yalaba.
It’s not a job.	Si mulimu.
I don’t have time.	Sirina budde.
He can’t eat anything.	Tasobola kulya kintu kyonna.
He said that he was.	Yagambye nti bwe yali.
That seems to be the case.	Ekyo kirabika bwe kiri.
Like the fact that you’re there.	Nga ensonga nti oli awo.
I want more time in the day.	Njagala obudde bungi mu lunaku.
Or with you.	Oba naawe.
I’m just here.	Nze ndi wano kyokka.
I just can’t do that.	Nze ekyo kyokka sisobola kukikola.
You can too!.	Naawe osobola!.
Knowing he can’t have anything he wants.	Okumanya nti tayinza kuba na ky’ayagala.
But she looked good too.	Naye naye yali alabika bulungi.
I need help here.	Nze wano nneetaaga obuyambi.
You don’t want to talk about school.	Toyagala kwogera ku ssomero.
We have the time.	Tulina obudde.
No one is really talking about it.	Tewali muntu yenna ayogera ku nsonga eyo mu butuufu.
Nothing was coming.	Tewali kyali kijja.
But no one could.	Naye nga tewali asobola.
I have a dog.	Nnina embwa.
I have no idea where they are, or whether, they are.	Sirina kye mmanyi gye bali, oba oba, gye bali.
I love that he did that.	Njagala nnyo nti ekyo yakikola.
I wanted to talk all night.	Nnali njagala okwogera ekiro kyonna.
That is not	Ekyo si .
But that was it.	Naye ekyo kye kyali.
I think that’s true.	Ndowooza ekyo kituufu.
We only have you.	Ffe tulina ggwe wekka.
It can happen to anyone.	Kiyinza okutuuka ku muntu yenna.
The police thought it was him.	Poliisi yalowooza nti ye ye.
He knew why he was so happy.	Yali amanyi ensonga lwaki yali musanyufu nnyo.
Swimming on the weekends.	Okuwuga ku wiikendi.
It comes and goes.	Kijja era kigenda.
That’s good for me.	Ekyo kirungi gyendi.
Of course, that is not true.	Kya lwatu, ekyo si kituufu.
And in fact he was.	Era mu butuufu yali.
But, it doesn’t matter.	Naye, si kikulu.
I know where they are.	Nze mmanyi gye bali.
However, there is no truth to this.	Kyokka, tewali mazima ku nsonga eno.
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
He will be for a little while longer, as well.	Ajja kuba okumala akaseera katono, era.
That’s the time.	Ekyo kye kiseera.
it's not me.	si nze.
It’s going to be good.	Kigenda kuba kirungi.
I'll get it soon.	Nja kufuna mangu.
That's why we're here today.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tuli wano leero.
We’re in a crisis point, actually.	Tuli mu kifo kya buzibu, mu butuufu.
I'll do whatever you want.	Nja kukola buli kyoyagala.
No, of course, you should.	Nedda, ddala, wandibadde okola.
We come, we go.	Tujja, tugenda.
I can’t do it.	Siyinza kukikola.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
I'm not sure about that.	Sikakasa ku ekyo.
Not a little bit.	Si katono.
He can do that.	Ekyo asobola okukikola.
Really really not happy about this.	Ddala ddala si musanyufu ku kino.
However, he seemed willing to do so.	Kyokka, yali alabika nga mwetegefu okukikola.
One in each.	Omu mu buli emu.
You will have time.	Ojja kufuna obudde.
He is the only child.	Ye mwana yekka.
I know you don’t know.	Nkimanyi nti tomanyi.
But it may be that.	Naye kiyinza okuba nga.
I will never do it again.	Sijja kuddamu kukikola.
He felt that .	Yawulira nti .
It’s my turn to speak up.	Kye kiseera kyange okwogera.
But he couldn’t see much.	Naye yali tasobola kulaba bingi.
I wanted it in me.	Nnali njagala mu nze.
This is really normal.	Kino ddala kya bulijjo.
It was a wonderful feeling.	Yali mpulira nnungi nnyo.
He's a man's man, he thought.	Ye musajja wa musajja, bwe yalowooza.
It’s one of us.	Kye kimu ku ffe.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
We do have a dog.	Tulina ddala embwa.
Of course, it will be true.	Kya lwatu nti kijja kuba kituufu.
Always, about any of this, about everything.	Bulijjo, ku buli kimu ku bino, ku buli kimu.
I wanted to be alone for a little while.	Nnali njagala kubeera nzekka okumala akaseera katono.
My father does it all the time.	Taata akikola buli kiseera.
I'm just curious, that's all.	Nze njagala okumanya, ekyo kyokka.
It’s bad for everyone.	Kibi eri buli muntu.
No, he said.	Nedda, bwe yagambye.
Not without risk.	Si nga tewali bulabe.
I’ve got some money.	Nfunye ku ssente.
The guy, of course.	Ggaayi, ddala.
No one here knows anything about your system.	Tewali muntu yenna wano amanyi kintu kyonna ku nkola yo.
That's why he was dangerous.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki yali wa bulabe.
That one is there.	Oyo ali eyo.
It’s not easy to do.	Si kyangu kukola.
It’s really important.	Ddala kikulu nnyo.
Attitude you need to know.	Endowooza olina okumanya.
Tomorrow will be worse.	Enkya kijja kuba kibi nnyo.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
We have everything.	Tulina buli kimu.
You can see where this is going.	Osobola okulaba kino gye kigenda.
I don’t know the exact location.	Simanyi kifo kituufu we kiri.
My father, of course.	Taata wange, ddala.
That’s obviously not good for you.	Ekyo kirabika si kirungi gy’oli.
You love this movie.	Oyagala nnyo firimu eno.
He didn’t know what he wanted.	Yali tamanyi kye yali ayagala.
No problem with us.	Tewali buzibu naffe.
He would be closer to me.	Yandibadde asinga kumpi nange.
You belong to this place.	Oli wa kifo kino.
Going to have to read a book.	Okugenda okubeera nga olina okusoma ekitabo.
I had no choice.	Nali sirina kye nnyinza kukola.
And it is very true.	Era kituufu nnyo.
You are absolutely fine.	Oli bulungi ddala.
However, he was afraid.	Kyokka yali atya.
However, he could not be everywhere either.	Kyokka ne ye yali tasobola kubeera buli wamu.
. . . .	.
Here, there isn’t.	Wano, tewali.
Nobody knows you’re coming here.	Tewali amanyi nti ojja wano.
He could be what he wanted to be.	Yali asobola okuba kye yali ayagala okuba.
But he knew he had no choice.	Naye yali akimanyi nti talina kya kukola.
We’re fine here.	Tuli bulungi wano.
I am very happy to be here.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo okubeera wano.
It was very typical of what he would do.	Kyali kya bulijjo nnyo ku ekyo kye yandikoze.
We will stay on that schedule.	Tujja kusigala ku nteekateeka eyo.
I can, of course.	Nsobola, ddala.
And everyone has their own agenda.	Era buli muntu alina agenda ye.
You love to talk.	Oyagala nnyo okwogera.
He didn’t need any money.	Yali teyeetaaga ssente yonna.
Not anytime though.	Si ssaawa yonna wadde.
We'll have another chance at this.	Tujja kufuna omukisa omulala ku kino.
The night is difficult.	Ekiro kizibu.
This could be anything.	Kino kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
We’ll do it ourselves.	Ffe tujja kukikola.
And everyone wanted to know.	Era buli omu yali ayagala okumanya.
You should have known that.	Ekyo wandibadde okimanyi.
But that won’t happen.	Naye ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
Now, that is obviously not the case.	Kati, kirabika ekyo si bwe kiri.
That’s nothing, you know.	Ekyo si kintu kyonna, omanyi.
We have to do the same thing.	Naffe tulina okukola ekintu kye kimu.
The age is yes.	Si ye ye.
I have my own preferences.	Nnina bye njagala.
He was finished.	Yali amaze.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
We were going to talk about something.	Twali tugenda kwogera ku kintu.
My wife is not like that.	Mukyala wange si bwe kiri.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
It may not be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nga si bwe kiri.
You’re just a man.	Oli musajja yekka.
He always knew.	Bulijjo yali amanyi.
I loved all of that.	Ebyo byonna nnali njagala nnyo.
You won’t want to be there.	Tojja kwagala kubeera eyo.
What do you think? 	Ggwe olowooza ki?
At the time, he could not speak.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali tasobola kwogera.
Please, that would be nice.	Nsaba, ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
However, it is almost too difficult.	Kyokka, kumpi kizibu nnyo.
He would certainly do the same.	Mazima ddala yandikoze ekintu kye kimu.
I really don’t have an issue.	Mazima ddala sirina nsonga.
He has to be.	Alina okubeera.
And soon he knew.	Era mu bbanga ttono n’amanya.
However, he was very good.	Kyokka yali mulungi nnyo.
He is a very, very good man.	Musajja mulungi nnyo nnyo.
I know who he is.	Nze mmanyi ky’ali.
We can do it.	Tusobola okukikola.
Same thing with me.	Ekintu kye kimu ne nange.
In a way, my father was lucky.	Mu ngeri emu, taata yalina omukisa.
He couldn’t see clearly.	Yali tasobola kulaba bulungi.
Not until this week.	Si okutuusa wiiki eno.
But of course, that wasn’t the case.	Naye kya lwatu, ekyo si bwe kyali.
Not a bad idea, maybe.	Si kirowoozo kibi, mpozzi.
I thought she was fine.	Nalowooza nti yali bulungi.
Knowing that this really was it.	Okumanya nti kino ddala kye kyali.
This was very difficult for me.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo gyendi.
Why exactly.	Lwaki ddala.
No one wanted it here.	Tewali yali ayagala wano.
Then it’s in the movie.	Awo kiri mu firimu.
He was a very nice person.	Yali muntu mulungi nnyo.
This is a very serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
He wouldn’t have known.	Yandibadde tamanyi.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
That’s what it is, that’s everything.	Ekyo kye kiri, ekyo kye buli kimu.
But now it doesn’t matter with me.	Naye kati si kikulu nange.
And it is very dangerous.	Era kya bulabe nnyo.
There is no such thing.	Tewali kintu ng’ekyo bwe kiri.
To me you are.	Eri nze ggwe oli.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
I’m working hard.	Nze nkola nnyo.
This was a challenging and beautiful place.	Kino kyali kifo kizibu era nga kirungi nnyo.
You know my opinion.	Omanyi endowooza yange.
I have high hopes about it.	Nnina essuubi ddene ku nsonga eyo.
For a little while.	Okumala akaseera katono.
I'm not quite sure what to do about it.	Sikakasa bulungi kya kukikola.
He couldn't talk to her, yet.	Yali tasobola kwogera naye, nga tannaba.
Then everything seemed fine.	Awo buli kimu ne kirabika nga kirungi.
We’re going to spend the day with him today.	Olunaku tugenda kumala naye leero.
I won’t say anything.	Sijja kwogera kintu kyonna.
And they are very friendly.	Era ba mukwano nnyo.
I wanted to do something difficult.	Nnali njagala okukola ekintu ekizibu.
You should think about this.	Wandibadde olowooza ku nsonga eno.
My father wanted to buy.	Taata yali ayagala kugula.
Now it’s time to go.	Kati kye kiseera okugenda.
And yet it was.	Era naye bwe kyali.
He didn’t need any help.	Yali teyeetaaga buyambi bwonna.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
That’s all he saw.	Ekyo kyokka kye yalaba.
I have so much of me.	Nnina bingi nnyo ku nze.
This is up to you.	Kino kiri ku ggwe.
I can only get that.	Nze nsobola okufuna ekyo kyokka.
But no money or time.	Naye nga tewali ssente wadde obudde.
It’s not so easy.	Si kyangu nnyo.
But we need to be safe.	Naye twetaaga okuba nga tetulina bulabe.
That was very powerful.	Ekyo kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
But he needs help.	Naye yeetaaga obuyambi.
I 'm the only one	Nze nzekka .
He is very beautiful.	Ali mulungi nnyo.
But he needed to know.	Naye yali yeetaaga okumanya.
That may be the case.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
I don’t know what time it is.	Simanyi ssaawa ki.
The guy looked good, of course.	Ggaayi yalabika bulungi, ddala.
He would have to do it.	Yandibadde alina okukikola.
For a very long time.	Okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
He spoke quickly.	Yayogera mangu.
It’s much more complicated than it is.	Kizibu nnyo okusinga bwe kiri.
He didn't want anyone near him.	Yali tayagala muntu yenna kumpi naye.
You are with me now.	Oli nange kati.
No time, no time, no time.	Tewali budde, tewali budde, tewali budde.
The other is young.	Omulala muto.
And we are lucky that he is with us.	Era tulina omukisa nti ali naffe.
Like, very well.	Nga, bulungi nnyo.
I want to work on that.	Njagala kukola ku ekyo.
He shouldn’t do it.	Tasaanidde kukikola.
We’re in your car.	Tuli mu mmotoka yo.
That’s pretty cool, actually.	Ekyo kirungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
And yet it's a doctor's thing.	Era naye kintu kya musawo.
I had no answer.	Nze nali sirina kya kuddamu.
He will probably talk to you.	Oboolyawo ajja kwogera naawe.
He hasn't spoken yet.	Tannaba kwogera.
He wasn’t like that.	Yali si bw’atyo.
We desperately needed this.	Kino twali twetaaga nnyo.
As in fact it is.	Nga mu butuufu bwe kiri.
He said that would be easy.	Yagambye nti ekyo kyandibadde kyangu.
Now it is not.	Kati si bwe kiri.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
He was a really nice person.	Yali muntu mulungi ddala.
He looked asleep.	Yalabika nga yeebase.
This was both of them.	Kino baali bombi.
I have to be doing something about it.	Nnina okuba nga nnina kye nkola ku nsonga eyo.
There was nothing he could do about it though.	Tewali kye yali asobola kukola ku nsonga eno wadde.
But in truth, he was afraid too.	Naye mu mazima, naye yali atya.
I need ya on this.	Nze nneetaaga ya ku kino.
You are a doctor.	Oli musawo.
I have to be ready.	Nnina okuba nga ndi mwetegefu.
Not hard, but all the time.	Si kizibu, naye buli kiseera.
It was a terrible thing.	Kyali kibi nnyo.
I hope he does come.	Nsuubira nti ddala ajja.
I want to talk to you.	Njagala kwogera naawe.
I’m not going to do it.	Sigenda kukikola.
It was something he would have done anyway.	Kyali kye yandikoze mu ngeri yonna.
I couldn’t wait to see the movie.	Nnali siyinza kulinda kulaba firimu eyo.
I need your opinion on this.	Nneetaaga endowooza yo ku nsonga eno.
And now all this.	Era kati bino byonna.
I belong to him too.	Nange ndi wa ye.
There is nothing to see here.	Wano tewali kya kulaba.
I'm not sure what this is.	Sikakasa kino kiki.
Not so in this case.	Si bwe kiri mu mbeera eno.
In fact, you probably won’t do such a thing.	Mu butuufu, osanga tojja kukola kintu ng’ekyo.
I am not sure what to do about this.	Sikakasa kya kukola ku kino.
It was obvious to me.	Kyali kya lwatu gyendi.
I do know one thing.	Nze mmanyi ekintu kimu.
I can’t wait to get one!.	Siyinza kulinda kufuna emu!.
But it won’t happen.	Naye tekijja kubaawo.
But it may be normal.	Naye kiyinza okuba nga kya bulijjo.
That was just the right thing to do.	Ekyo kyali kituufu kyokka.
He can’t do it.	Tasobola kukikola.
I needed to know everything immediately, every day.	Nnali nneetaaga okumanya buli kimu amangu ddala, buli lunaku.
Like this picture.	Nga ekifaananyi kino.
That would have worked out just fine.	Ekyo kyandibadde kigenda bulungi.
This is not a good thing.	Kino si kirungi.
It’s not mine.	Si kyange.
In this room.	Mu kisenge kino.
It would probably be very difficult.	Oboolyawo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
Everything seems to me.	Buli kimu kirabika gyendi.
And there appears to be a car in the distance.	Era kirabika waliwo mmotoka mu bbanga.
That was the guy she wanted to be.	Oyo ye yali ggaayi gwe yali ayagala okubeera.
Me, too, at this point.	Nange, mu kiseera kino.
You will see, everything will be fine.	Ojja kulaba, buli kimu kijja kuba bulungi.
In the morning you go.	Ku makya ogenda.
I have a moment.	Nnina akaseera.
I wasn’t sure how.	Nali sikakasa ngeri ki.
He must have thought she was right behind him.	Ateekwa okuba nga yalowooza nti yali emabega we ddala.
I don’t want to be here.	Saagala kubeera wano.
I thought that was pretty cool.	Nalowooza nti ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
He wanted an actress.	Yali ayagala muzannyi wa firimu.
Actually, that’s the point.	Mu butuufu, eyo y’ensonga.
But help is at hand.	Naye obuyambi buli kumpi.
I can’t do anything about it.	Sisobola kukikola kintu kyonna.
Or else, it’s worse than that.	Oba nedda, kibi okusinga ekyo.
No, nothing really happening.	Nedda, tewali kigenda mu maaso ddala.
And he talked to everyone.	Era yayogera ne buli muntu.
He would do as he pleased.	Yandikoze nga bwe yali ayagala.
Soon you will come to a house.	Mu bbanga ttono ojja kujja mu nnyumba emu.
For the best.	Okusinga obulungi.
It can certainly help a lot.	Mazima ddala kiyinza okuyamba ennyo.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
This is definitely not a common practice.	Kino ddala si nkola ya bulijjo.
Would anyone else?.	Waliwo omuntu omulala yenna yandikoze?.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
I don’t think it will last very long.	Sirowooza nti kijja kumala bbanga ddene nnyo.
She wasn’t young but she was beautiful.	Yali si muto naye nga mulungi.
I had nothing to do.	Nnali sirina kye nkola.
He is young and strong.	Muto era wa maanyi.
He always wanted to be in one.	Bulijjo yali ayagala okubeera mu kimu.
I might go home soon.	Nnyinza okudda awaka amangu ddala.
He had three hours.	Yalina essaawa ssatu.
I wonder what it was.	Nze nneebuuza nti kyali ki.
He was like me.	Yali nga nze.
But we’ll see.	Naye tujja kulaba.
I have no idea what it was.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku kiki kye kyali.
My father seemed so close, so happy.	Taata yalabika kumpi nnyo, nga musanyufu nnyo.
It’s actually a really good idea.	Mu butuufu kirowoozo kirungi ddala.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
We have a lot to do.	Tulina bingi bye tulina okukola.
It was me.	Ye yali nze.
We can do this better.	Kino tusobola okukikola obulungi.
Is he in? 	Ali mu?
. . . .	.
He may be here.	Ayinza okuba wano.
Not because of this.	Si lwa kino.
I'll wait in my office.	Nja kulinda mu ofiisi yange.
He felt better every day.	Yawulira bulungi buli lunaku.
He spoke the truth.	Yayogera mu mazima.
I was so good, he was the best.	Nali mulungi nnyo, ye yali asinga.
She looks better than ever.	Alabika bulungi okusinga bwe yali alabika.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
That’s my wife.	Oyo ye mukyala wange.
Now he didn't need one.	Kati yali teyeetaaga emu.
I don’t think this will actually work.	Sirowooza nti kino kijja kukola mu butuufu.
Mostly, that would be fine.	Okusinga, ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
But it is very important.	Naye kikulu nnyo.
If he wanted to he could.	Singa yali ayagala yali asobola.
Now it’s everywhere.	Kati kiri buli wamu.
He knew that, and yet .	Ekyo yali akimanyi, era naye .
I don’t want to go.	Saagala kugenda.
I’m going to do that too.	Ekyo nange ngenda kukikola.
But there is a perspective.	Naye waliwo endowooza.
It wasn’t him.	Si ye yali.
Maybe it was .	Mpozzi nga yali .
He felt better now.	Yawulira bulungi kati.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
And we actually can.	Era mu butuufu tusobola.
He said it was more than likely.	Yagambye nti okusinga bwe kyali.
He was a happy man.	Yali muntu musanyufu.
Glad to see this happening.	Musanyufu okulaba nga kino kigenda mu maaso.
It looks good.	Kirabika bulungi.
But that is definitely not the case.	Naye mazima ddala ekyo si bwe kiri.
He does for a while.	Akola okumala akaseera.
And you’re not alone.	Era si ggwe wekka.
Good, everybody.	Kirungi, buli muntu.
Nothing is real.	Tewali kintu kya ddala.
He knew he would never be himself again.	Yali akimanyi nti tajja kuddamu kubeera ye kennyini.
She loved dogs.	Yali ayagala nnyo embwa.
He's such a sweetheart.	Ye muganzi bw'atyo.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
And now, this.	Era kati, kino.
He was completely alone now.	Yali yekka ddala kati.
I didn’t know.	Nnali simanyi.
You know that we are .	Omanyi nti tuli .
I think he was unhappy.	Ndowooza yali si musanyufu.
Everything happens so fast.	Buli kimu kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
It’s really true.	Ddala kituufu.
Better do something about that, he thought.	Kirungi okukola ekintu ku ekyo, bwe yalowooza.
No one is speaking.	Tewali ayogera.
And there was a reason.	Era nga waliwo ensonga.
He does that a lot.	Ekyo akikola nnyo.
And maybe even it was.	Era mpozzi ne bwe kyali.
He is not here.	Tali wano.
You’re the only one.	Ggwe wekka.
This is what one should do.	Kino omuntu yandikoze.
This is powerful!.	Kino kya maanyi!.
I want to be that guy.	Njagala kubeera ggaayi oyo.
But not everyone can.	Naye si buli muntu nti asobola.
For a moment I was me, alone.	Okumala akaseera nnali nze, nzekka.
He talks a lot.	Ayogera nnyo.
She looks so beautiful.	Alabika bulungi nnyo.
Good job.	Omulimu omulungi.
He should be in jail.	Alina okuba mu kkomera.
He couldn't allow it to go on he knew.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza kugenda mu maaso yali amanyi.
If he sleeps tonight.	Singa yeebase ekiro kino.
But he was afraid.	Naye yali atya.
You won’t be comfortable.	Tojja kubeera bulungi.
But it’s not about that.	Naye si kya ekyo.
I am sick, sick, sick.	Ndi mulwadde, mulwadde, mulwadde.
You are a schoolteacher.	Oli musomesa wa ssomero.
He was more than passive.	Yali asinga obutakola.
He won’t last long.	Tajja kumala bbanga ddene.
No one told me that.	Ekyo tewali yang’amba.
He must have been asleep for a long time.	Ateekwa okuba nga yali amaze ebbanga ddene nga yeebase.
I'm not sure this will work though.	Sikakasa nti kino kijja kukola wadde.
I have my own way.	Nnina engeri yange.
And maybe that was just fine.	Era oboolyawo ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
It’s just good.	Kirungi kyokka.
And for a very long time.	Era okumala ebbanga ddene nnyo.
He thought of his father.	Yalowooza ku taata we.
Not long at all.	Si bbanga ddene n’akatono.
But there was nothing wrong with me.	Naye nga tewali kibi kyonna kye nnali.
We can’t see anything.	Tetusobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
This is, of course, true.	Kino, ddala, kituufu.
It is probably easier this way.	Oboolyawo mu ngeri eno kyangu.
And he was not a friendly man.	Era yali si musajja wa mukwano.
He will probably have to go.	Oboolyawo ajja kuba alina okugenda.
I was the only one.	Nze nnali nzekka.
All food, of course.	Emmere yonna, ddala.
I was always ready to go then.	Bulijjo nnali mwetegefu okugenda mu kiseera ekyo.
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nnina okukola.
You will get food.	Ojja kufuna emmere.
We have to be.	Tulina okuba nga tuli.
No one has any idea what’s going on.	Tewali alina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
This will do, he thought.	Kino kijja kukola, bwe yalowooza.
We have to go back.	Tulina okudda emabega.
He shouldn’t do it.	Tasaanidde kukikola.
You are nobody.	Ggwe toli muntu yenna.
You can’t have everything.	Tosobola kuba na buli kimu.
And this is not easy.	Era kino si kyangu.
Nothing.	Tewali.
He will deal with this.	Ajja kukola ku nsonga eno.
I didn’t think you could do it.	Nnali sirowooza nti osobola okukikola.
We’ll get back to this shortly.	Tugenda kudda ku nsonga eno mu bbanga ttono.
I'll know soon enough.	Nja kumanya mu bbanga ttono.
He certainly had a point.	Mazima ddala yalina ensonga.
And so it was with all of us.	Era ffenna bwe kyali.
We will do this again.	Kino tujja kuddamu okukikola.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Mpozzi enkya ekiro.
He wanted something.	Alina kye yali ayagala.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
From my father.	Okuva eri taata wange.
You have to get that all the time.	Ekyo olina okufuna buli kiseera.
He doesn't know what he wants.	Tamanyi ky'ayagala.
I always wanted to get back to that.	Bulijjo nnali njagala okudda ku ekyo.
And yes, this is a great movie.	Era ye, eno firimu nnungi nnyo.
It’s really something for everyone.	Ddala kintu kya buli muntu.
You know it’s true.	Omanyi nti kituufu.
I thought about where I was going.	Nalowooza ku kifo we nnali ngenda.
In that respect we were the same.	Mu nsonga eyo twali kye kimu.
This seems so simple.	Kino kirabika nga kyangu nnyo.
That is not the case at all.	Ekyo si bwe kiri n’akatono.
Now he is happy.	Kati musanyufu.
This could be your dog, your cat or even you.	Kino kiyinza okuba embwa yo, embwa yo oba wadde ggwe.
But this is very simple.	Naye kino kyangu nnyo.
No one knows what a good idea is.	Tewali amanyi kirowoozo kirungi kye ki.
That it’s not me.	Nti si nze.
Maybe you don’t know yourself.	Mpozzi nga tomanyi ggwe kennyini.
He looked completely normal.	Yalabika nga wa bulijjo ddala.
And that’s both bad and good.	Era ekyo kibi era kirungi.
No, it’s not there.	Nedda, si awo.
You’re not alone though.	Toli wekka wadde.
He felt it wasn’t his place to do it.	Yawulira nti si kye kifo kye okukikola.
Don't know why, really.	Tomanyi lwaki, ddala.
I won’t preach.	Sijja kubuulira.
I know it would be.	Nkimanyi nti kyandibadde.
And not to me.	Era si gyendi.
Like he knew it would.	Nga bwe yali akimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
To the object.	Eri ekintu.
But that was very difficult.	Naye ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
It may be soon.	Kiyinza okuba nga mu bbanga ttono.
But he also felt happy.	Naye era yawulira nga musanyufu.
And yet, they certainly are.	Era naye, mazima ddala bwe bali.
He could talk anyone into anything.	Yali asobola okwogera omuntu yenna mu kintu kyonna.
He really had to.	Ddala yalina okukikola.
This looks great.	Kino kirabika bulungi nnyo.
This is probably for the better.	Kino osanga kya bulungi.
It will always be something like that for them.	Bulijjo kijja kuba kintu ng’ekyo gye bali.
He was a good boyfriend.	Ye yali muganzi omulungi.
And then we’ll go home.	Era awo tujja kudda eka.
He does that here.	Ekyo akikola wano.
Will be wanting one though.	Ajja kuba ayagala emu wadde.
He was very lonely.	Yali yekka nnyo.
And still nothing.	Era n’okutuusa kati tewali kintu kyonna.
I want your opinion.	Njagala endowooza yo.
Lots of things, probably.	Ebintu bingi, oboolyawo.
Here, however, is a problem.	Kyokka wano waliwo ekizibu.
You were my friend.	Ggwe wali mukwano gwange.
But today is not about that.	Naye leero si ku ekyo.
He's been here so long already.	Abadde wano ebbanga ddene nnyo dda.
I was in the office at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali mu ofiisi.
But maybe .	Naye mpozzi .
I hope he is.	Nsuubira nti y’ali.
I really have nothing to do.	Mazima ddala sirina kye nkola.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
And he always has been.	Era bulijjo abadde bw’atyo.
My brother is so so.	Muganda wange bw’atyo bw’atyo.
And that’s what he tried to do.	Era ekyo kye yagezaako okukola.
Something that goes for both of them.	Ekintu ekigenda gye bali bombi.
Above all of all.	Okusinga byonna byonna.
He wants the truth, he thought.	Ayagala mazima, bwe yalowooza.
It’s hard to see any merit in this.	Kizibu okulaba obulungi bwonna mu nsonga eno.
I'll see what he has to say about it.	Nja kulaba ky'alina okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
Do whatever he wanted with that.	Akole kyonna kye yali ayagala ku ekyo.
I am well aware of that.	Ekyo nkimanyi bulungi.
That is my plan.	Eyo ye nteekateeka yange.
It will be good for you.	Kijja kuba kirungi gy’oli.
Anyone is lucky.	Omuntu yenna alina omukisa.
I won’t have you there.	Sijja kuba naawe eyo.
. . . .	.
And you don’t have to either.	Era naawe tolina kukikola.
Very good at that, very powerful.	Kirungi nnyo ku ekyo, kya maanyi nnyo.
He was finished behind me.	Yali amaze emabega wange.
He was still dangerous.	Yali akyali wa bulabe.
I really have no problem.	Mazima ddala sirina buzibu.
And he shouldn’t do that.	Era ekyo tasaanidde kukikola.
I have a dog.	Nnina embwa.
Lucky for me.	Omukisa gyendi.
Today there is no .	Leero tewali .
I really want to.	Ddala njagala.
However, he is asleep.	Kyokka ye yeebase.
What is it that is.	Kiki kye kiri.
But he just wanted to go to his place.	Naye yali ayagala kugenda mu kifo kye kyokka.
That’s not exactly the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri ddala.
That seems pretty cool.	Ekyo kirabika nga kirungi nnyo.
I’m sure this won’t be good.	Nkakasa nti kino tekijja kuba kirungi.
No one wants that.	Ekyo tewali ayagala.
I hope it goes well.	Nsuubira nti kigenda bulungi.
He asked for my opinion on this.	Yasaba endowooza yange ku nsonga eno.
He would be mine.	Yandibadde wange.
It looks pretty good.	Kirabika kirungi nnyo.
So far, nothing.	N’okutuusa kati, tewali kintu kyonna.
This is the job.	Guno gwe mulimu.
He is not me.	Ye si nze.
But that’s not what really matters.	Naye ekyo si kye kikulu ennyo.
But this is not hard to answer.	Naye kino si kizibu kuddamu.
He talked to her all the time.	Yali ayogera naye buli kiseera.
He's not there.	Tali awo.
I'm not entirely sure why this is happening.	Sikakasa ddala lwaki kino kigenda mu maaso.
But he did it anyway.	Naye yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
That’s the way it is.	Ekyo bwe kiri.
Here is the issue.	Wano we wali ensonga.
Something will work.	Ekintu kijja kukola.
I want it easy.	Njagala kyangu.
I thought we would always be together.	Nalowooza nti bulijjo tujja kuba ffembi.
Not a good time now.	Si kiseera kirungi kati.
We were on.	Twali ku...
And you have me too.	Era naawe olina nze.
But he did it, he did it.	Naye yakikola, yakikola.
Not in the movies, mostly.	Si mu firimu, okusinga.
This wasn’t it.	Kino kyali nedda.
Everything is going to be fine.	Buli kimu kigenda kuba bulungi.
This seems to be a complicated problem.	Kino kirabika kizibu kizibu.
I’m sorry but that.	Nsonyiwa naye ekyo.
Let him do anything but work.	Akole kyonna okuggyako okukola.
He thinks hard about it all.	Alowooza nnyo ku byonna.
Everyone said that.	Buli omu yagamba bw’atyo.
Or both of us.	Oba ffembi.
He did the same thing in the morning.	Yakola kye kimu ku makya.
The bus here is very good.	Bbaasi wano nnungi nnyo.
Good, my bad.	Kirungi, kibi kyange.
There is no plan.	Tewali nteekateeka yonna.
That’s what I was thinking.	Ekyo nnali ndowooza.
I’ve always wondered about that.	Ekyo bulijjo mbadde nneebuuza.
In the context.	Mu nsonga.
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
I already knew that.	Ekyo nnali mmanyi dda.
He loves it really.	Ayagala nnyo ddala.
And it’s mine.	Era kyange.
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
He needed to think.	Yali yeetaaga okulowooza.
He didn’t quite know what to do.	Yali tamanyi bulungi kya kukola.
None, just the basement.	Tewali, kisenge kya wansi kyokka.
I think everyone will.	Ndowooza buli muntu ajja kukikola.
But she looked so beautiful and happy.	Naye yali alabika bulungi nnyo era nga musanyufu.
I can’t be here.	Sisobola kubeera wano.
They certainly are.	Mazima ddala bwe bali.
In fact, it looks pretty cool.	Mu butuufu, kirabika nga kirungi nnyo.
I still know almost nothing about it.	N’okutuusa kati kumpi sirina kye mmanyi ku nsonga eyo.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali sisobola kukikola.
Now that’s not true.	Kati ekyo si kituufu.
I don't have as good as this one.	Nze sirina mulungi nga guno.
What a blessing you are.	Nga oli mukisa gwa maanyi.
I'm so sorry, but I am.	Nsonyiwa nnyo naye nze.
He came right down.	Yajja wansi ddala.
It was what we needed to do.	Kyali kye twali twetaaga okukola.
I was happy to be here.	Nnali musanyufu okubeera wano.
I am lucky.	Ndi wa mukisa.
And not just anyone.	Era si muntu yenna yekka.
There is no reason why we can’t.	Tewali nsonga lwaki tetusobola.
. . . .	.
It’s as bad as it can be.	Kibi nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
That is why this issue is serious.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki ensonga eno ya maanyi.
Maybe it’s time to move on.	Mpozzi nga kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
No one knows that better than I do.	Ekyo tewali akimanyi okusinga nze.
However, I don't know how to do it.	Kyokka, simanyi ngeri ya kukikola.
Obviously, it is.	Kya lwatu nti bwe kiri.
He did very well.	Yakola bulungi nnyo.
He felt he was doing well.	Yawulira ng’akola bulungi.
Is that right?.	Ekyo kituufu?.
So far, this is not an issue of efficiency.	N’okutuusa kati, eno si nsonga ya kukola bulungi.
He had no idea, he said.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna, bwe yagambye.
You won’t make any money, but you can’t have everything.	Tojja kufuna ssente yonna, naye tosobola kuba na buli kimu.
He probably didn’t need to.	Oboolyawo yali teyeetaaga.
I wanted a week to think.	Nnali njagala wiiki emu okulowooza.
Someone actually does.	Omuntu mu butuufu akola.
Just that one night.	Ekiro ekyo kimu kyokka.
It only matters that he should be.	Kikulu kyokka nti alina okuba.
Let me think about all of that.	Ka ndowooza ku ebyo byonna.
He wanted to, all the time.	Yali ayagala, buli kiseera.
No one comes close.	Tewali ajja kumpi.
Maybe this can help.	Mpozzi kino kiyinza okuyamba.
Maybe he will love my person.	Mpozzi ajja kwagala omuntu wange.
Nothing can help.	Tewali kiyinza kuyamba.
And together, we are winning.	Era nga tuli wamu, tuli kuwangula.
Only someone knew.	Omuntu yekka ye yali amanyi.
But we need to know where we are.	Naye twetaaga okumanya gye tuli.
He was always trying to do it.	Bulijjo yali agezaako okukikola.
. . . .	.
But he was a human being.	Naye yali mwana wa muntu.
That's right, that's right.	Kituufu, kituufu.
I’ve got a little time.	Nfunye akaseera katono.
This is a normal thing.	Kino kintu kya bulijjo.
There is no reason why.	Tewali nsonga yonna lwaki.
Beautiful, actually.	Mulungi, mu butuufu.
It was much worse than that.	Kyali kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
You're not good.	Toli mulungi.
However, that is not the point.	Kyokka, eyo si y’ensonga.
That's a good point to make.	Eyo nsonga nnungi okutuusa.
I am all right.	Nze byonna ndi bulungi.
Not openly, of course.	Si mu lwatu, ddala.
He obviously knew that he was very safe.	Kya lwatu nti yali akimanyi nti yali talina bulabe nnyo.
And not even true.	Era nga si kituufu wadde.
Or said anything at all.	Oba yayogera ekintu kyonna n’akatono.
He had a picture .	Yalina ekifaananyi .
I was a happy man.	Nnali musajja musanyufu.
He was the only one he had.	Ye yekka gwe yalina.
I’m not going to go.	Nze sigenda kugenda.
This is not an opinion.	Eno si ndowooza.
His wife is sick.	Mukyala we mulwadde.
It's coming.	Kijja.
This was good for both of us.	Kino kyali kirungi ffembi.
You proceed into the city.	Ogenda mu maaso mu kibuga.
Very nice guy.	Omulungi nnyo.
He said it was good.	Yagambye nti kirungi.
I don't know .	Simanyi .
She thought he wouldn't know.	Yalowooza nti tajja kumanya.
However, I hope not.	Kyokka nsuubira nti si bwe kiri.
And he is actually quite good.	Era mu butuufu mulungi nnyo.
Very very lucky .	Omukisa nnyo nnyo .
It won’t happen.	Tekijja kubaawo.
Whether one likes it or not.	Omuntu ayagala oba tayagala.
He didn’t think he needed one.	Yali talowooza nti yeetaaga emu.
He told me he could definitely help.	Yang’amba nti asobola ddala okuyamba.
He seemed very happy in this house now.	Yalabika nga musanyufu nnyo mu nnyumba eno kati.
That’s up to you.	Ekyo kiri gy’oli.
It can only help.	Kiyinza okuyamba kyokka.
We could do it together.	Twali tusobola okukikola ffenna.
He had to make a move.	Yalina okukola ekintu ekigenda mu maaso.
You can see whatever you want back there.	Osobola okulaba kyonna ky’oyagala emabega awo.
You can’t believe it.	Tosobola kukkiriza.
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
I will love working with him.	Nja kwagala nnyo okukola naye.
But more than that, he loved it.	Naye okusinga ekyo, yali ayagala nnyo.
You will eat again.	Ojja kuddamu okulya.
However, this is not a problem.	Kyokka kino si kizibu.
But it is not common.	Naye si kya bulijjo.
Maybe that was too good to be true.	Mpozzi ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I needed a good one.	Nnali nneetaaga omulungi.
There isn’t much time.	Tewali budde bungi.
He is not a child.	Si mwana muto.
But they are not very strong.	Naye si ba maanyi nnyo.
That was all he wanted.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali ayagala.
One actually has to see if he has those or not.	Omuntu mu butuufu alina okulaba oba alina ebyo oba nedda.
But nothing too serious.	Naye tewali kintu kya maanyi nnyo.
I wish we had it.	Njagala nnyo nga bwe tulina.
No one knew they were there together.	Tewali yali amanyi nti bali eyo bombi.
I know everything.	Nze buli kimu nkimanyi.
Just one night.	Ekiro kimu kyokka.
We have to talk tonight.	Tulina okwogera ekiro kino.
I was actually real about it.	Mu butuufu nnali wa ddala ku nsonga eno.
It was a very good point.	Yali nsonga nnungi nnyo.
Perhaps he did not know himself.	Oboolyawo ye kennyini yali tamanyi.
It is a labor of love.	Kye mulimu gwa kwagala.
He will definitely be here.	Mazima ddala ajja kuba wano.
I am the only one.	Nze nzekka nzekka.
Or me for that matter.	Oba nze ku nsonga eyo.
He is today.	Ali leero.
I don’t think he should have spoken.	Sirowooza nti yandibadde ayogera.
It’s a winning thing to do.	Kintu kya kuwangula okukola.
I was alone.	Nnali nzekka.
No one knew it.	Tewali yali akimanyi.
You love it, that’s hard.	Oyagala nnyo, ekyo kizibu.
He would love me more than anyone he knew.	Yandiyagadde nze okusinga omuntu yenna gwe yali amanyi.
That's why it was there.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki kyali awo.
He can't answer.	Tasobola kuddamu.
I'll just say this.	Nja kumala kwogera bino.
This is a terrible thing.	Kino kibi nnyo.
I certainly couldn’t.	Mazima ddala nnali sisobola.
Exactly the same problem as this one.	Ekizibu kye kimu ddala ne kino.
He would have been unable to speak.	Yandibadde tasobola kwogera.
You’ll find something everyone wants.	Ojja kufuna ky’ayagala buli muntu.
It wasn’t what he expected.	Si kye yali asuubira.
It had to be .	Yalina okuba nga .
They are always here.	Bulijjo bali wano.
No one spoke to him like that, no one.	Tewali yayogera naye bw’atyo, tewali.
I know that of course.	Nkimanyi nti ddala.
How young he had been.	Nga yali abadde muto nnyo.
It’s not very serious.	Si kya maanyi nnyo.
Everyone was very happy.	Buli omu yali musanyufu nnyo.
You, my friend, are okay.	Ggwe mukwano gwange tolina buzibu bwonna.
I'm like, you know what, that's so true.	Nze nga, omanyi ki, ekyo kituufu nnyo.
I am not strong enough.	Nze siri wa maanyi.
It was to be.	Kyali kya kubeera.
You don’t know.	Tomanyi.
I love it now.	Njagala nnyo kati.
I have to get out of here.	Nnina okuva wano.
This was a problem.	Kino kyali kizibu.
Everything is going well.	Buli kimu kigenda bulungi.
I might be the same.	Nze nnyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
In fact, it was quite common.	Mu butuufu, kyali kya bulijjo nnyo.
But you move on.	Naye ggwe ogenda mu maaso.
There is nothing wrong with being on your own.	Tewali kibi kyonna mu kubeera ku ggwe.
It would have been much easier.	Kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
I know exactly.	Nze mmanyi bulungi.
That’s a good thing to do in practice.	Ekyo kintu kirungi okukola mu nkola.
It was his routine.	Yali nkola ye.
Or he would have.	Oba yandibadde.
You me, you know what that is.	Ggwe nze, omanyi ekyo kye kiri.
I want to get help.	Njagala okufuna obuyambi.
That’s probably true.	Ekyo osanga kituufu.
You know where that is.	Omanyi ekyo gye kiri.
I need to do it!!!!.	Nze nsaba okukikola!!!!.
We are all here.	Ffenna tuli wano.
Even then it can be difficult.	Ne mu kiseera ekyo kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
I want to be with him all the time.	Njagala kubeera naye buli kiseera.
He can’t see anyone.	Tasobola kulaba muntu yenna.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
But the car was really great.	Naye ddala mmotoka yali nnungi nnyo.
. . . .	.
And very lonely.	Era nga ali yekka nnyo.
I just wanted to talk to you.	Nnali njagala kwogera naawe kyokka.
Something for the weekend.	Ekintu kya wiikendi.
You are a lovely woman.	Oli mukyala ayagala nnyo.
He is so beautiful.	Ye mulungi nnyo.
It’s not a problem at all.	Si kizibu kyonna.
But perhaps this is too complicated.	Naye mpozzi kino kizibu nnyo.
This is a daunting task.	Guno mulimu gwa maanyi.
We have to get home.	Tulina okutuuka awaka.
There is no side.	Tewali ludda.
I can’t quite believe it myself.	Nze kennyini sisobola bulungi kukkiriza.
You are his child.	Ggwe mwana we.
He is just a human being.	Ye muntu yekka.
The movie was actually really good.	Mu butuufu firimu yali nnungi ddala.
He can’t know.	Tasobola kumanya.
He knows exactly what these are.	Amanyi bulungi bino kiki.
He can last a week.	Asobola okumala wiiki.
To me he was an ordinary guy.	Eri nze yali ggaayi wa bulijjo.
I’m sure about that.	Nze nkakasa ku nsonga eyo.
Buying a car.	Okugula mmotoka.
But he could see the picture too.	Naye naye yali asobola okulaba ekifaananyi.
We’re fine.	Tuli bulungi.
That’s a good feeling.	Eyo mpulira nnungi.
He started to back away.	Yatandika okudda emabega.
I think he is that good.	Ndowooza mulungi bw’atyo.
I love money.	Njagala nnyo ssente.
It was always something.	Bulijjo kyali kintu.
And I’m curious and I love talking about movies.	Era njagala nnyo okumanya era njagala nnyo okwogera ku firimu.
She looked really good when she did, she thought.	Yalabika bulungi ddala bwe yakola bw’atyo, bwe yalowooza.
I know where they are, too, now.	Nze nange mmanyi gye bali, kati.
Or, it could be tomorrow.	Oba, kiyinza okuba enkya.
My father would be happy.	Taata yandibadde musanyufu.
He didn't know what it was.	Yali tamanyi kiki.
I thought you could do it.	Nalowooza nti oyinza okukikola.
We will do it together.	Tujja kukikola ffenna.
That wasn’t the issue.	Ekyo si kye kyali ensonga.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
He was a very young man.	Yali musajja muto nnyo.
Very easy to see through.	Kyangu nnyo okulaba mu.
This is where he wanted to be.	Wano we yali ayagala okubeera.
They’re in my office now.	Bali mu ofiisi yange kati.
I’m not quite sure yet.	Nze n’okutuusa kati simanyi bulungi.
I will stay with him.	Nja kusigala naye.
Not that much but apparently.	Si ekyo nnyo naye kirabika.
But he was beautiful.	Naye yali mulungi.
This was all very difficult.	Kino kyonna kyali kizibu nnyo.
I’m working a little bit.	Nze nkola katono.
I don’t know, really.	Simanyi, ddala.
He looked better now.	Yalabika bulungi kati.
You will love it as it was.	Ojja kwagala nga bwe kyali.
That would be us.	Ekyo kyandibadde ffe.
There is no reason.	Tewali nsonga.
He is my best friend.	Ye mukwano gwange ddala.
And now that is it.	Era kati ekyo kye kiri.
But of course you have.	Naye ddala olina.
I knew what to expect.	Nnali mmanyi kye nnali nsuubira.
That he will return soon, he knows.	Nti ajja kudda mangu, akimanyi.
And then, there you were.	Era awo, awo gye wali.
He needed to cum right away.	Yali yeetaaga okumala amangu ddala.
I know it’s in mine too.	Nkimanyi nti nange kiri mu kyange.
He wasn't going to do any of that.	Yali tagenda kukola kintu kyonna ku ebyo.
I want to do this.	Njagala kukola kino.
In every direction.	Mu buli ludda.
You don’t know what it is.	Tomanyi kye kiri.
I can’t do this.	Kino sisobola kukikola.
We have to do it!!.	Tulina okukikola!!.
He had an office all over town.	Yalina ofiisi yonna mu kibuga.
It may last up to a week.	Kiyinza okumala wiiki emu.
You know, a little bit like this.	Omanyi, katono nga kino.
My wife is coming there.	Mukyala wange ajja eyo.
And the book was him.	Era ekitabo kye yali ye.
He was always very interested.	Bulijjo yali ayagala nnyo.
I was very young at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali muto nnyo.
This is a good thing.	Kino kirungi.
I wanted to be him.	Nnali njagala kubeera ye.
Nobody comes here.	Tewali ajja wano.
He knew what it was.	Yali amanyi kye kyali.
Nothing was really right.	Tewali kyali kituufu ddala.
Dad, he thought.	Taata, bwe yalowooza.
I was a player.	Nze nali muzannyi.
Which he should be doing right now, actually.	Kye yandibadde akola mu kiseera kino, mu butuufu.
This is what he needed.	Kino kye yali yeetaaga.
But to me .	Naye gyendi .
He was my only child.	Yali mwana wange yekka.
I can be myself.	Nsobola okuba nzekka.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
That’s really important.	Ekyo ddala kikulu nnyo.
And that’s certainly true.	Era ekyo mazima ddala kituufu.
I really am.	Nze ddala ndi.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
Almost there now.	Kumpi awo kati.
I have no idea where they are now.	Sirina kye mmanyi gye bali kati.
If only he could get home.	Singa asobola okutuuka awaka.
He shouldn’t do it.	Tasaanidde kukikola.
And in his house, too.	Era mu nnyumba ye, naye.
And this was a good thing.	Era kino kyali kintu kirungi.
In fact, she looked better than she looked.	Mu butuufu, yali alabika bulungi okusinga bwe yali alabika.
But not, apparently, about money.	Naye si bwe kiri, kirabika, ku ssente.
He certainly did.	Mazima ddala yakikola.
My brother is there too.	Muganda wange naye ali eyo.
And he won’t be here tomorrow night.	Era tagenda kubeera wano enkya ekiro.
But he knew how it was.	Naye yali amanyi engeri gye kiri.
And a father, of course.	Era taata, ddala.
. . . .	.
It was almost true.	Kumpi kyali kituufu.
Strength I think.	Amaanyi ndowooza.
He came to talk to me.	Yajja okwogera nange.
Too bad, apparently.	Kibi nnyo, kirabika.
This was really real now.	Kino kyali ddala ddala kati.
Too early on the schedule.	Nga bukyali nnyo ku nteekateeka.
It’s not about me or us.	Si ku nze oba ku ffe.
He would like that.	Ekyo yandiyagadde.
Don’t go anywhere.	Togenda yonna.
You have .	Olina .
But you could too, and that is the problem.	Naye naawe wandibadde osobola era ekyo kye kizibu.
And on the day, when .	Era ku lunaku, bwe .
That is the hard problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu ekizibu.
I don’t know anything about it.	Simanyi kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
It will come soon, of course.	Kijja kujja mu bbanga ttono, ddala.
That’s all we will be.	Ekyo kyokka kye tujja okuba.
Not unemployed.	Si talina mulimu.
He was the only one who needed to know.	Ye yekka ye yali yeetaaga okumanya.
He was hopeful.	Yali alina essuubi.
He was already asleep.	Yali yeebase dda.
No waiting at all.	Tewali kulinda n’akatono.
He should be home, safe.	Alina okuba awaka, nga talina bulabe.
And it’s a simple answer.	Era kyangu kya kuddamu.
And he was curious.	Era yali ayagala okumanya.
Currently, they are not.	Mu kiseera kino, si bwe bali.
They were us.	Baali ffe.
He was just a kid.	Yali mwana muto yekka.
It’s as simple and complicated as that.	Kyangu era kizibu nga ekyo.
He has his own person.	Alina omuntu we.
I just think everyone should be into that.	Nze ndowooza kyokka nti buli muntu yandibadde mu ekyo.
I don’t know how to love a man.	Simanyi kwagala musajja.
Or even any reason.	Oba wadde ensonga yonna.
That’s what he had.	Ekyo kye yalina.
Another one.	Omulala.
This is not a good job.	Guno si mulimu mulungi.
You know so much.	Omanyi bingi nnyo.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
He was definitely going to be an ordinary person.	Mazima ddala yali agenda kubeera muntu wa bulijjo.
And no one likes anyone.	Era tewali ayagala muntu yenna.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
He is more than that to me.	Asinga ekyo gyendi.
I still didn’t know what to expect.	N’okutuusa kati nnali simanyi kye nnali nsuubira.
He may answer that.	Ekyo ayinza okuddamu.
Like food.	Nga emmere.
No one at all.	Tewali muntu yenna n’akatono.
I want to get to know the guy.	Njagala kumanya ggaayi oyo.
But it’s a sin.	Naye kibi.
This was a terrible time.	Kino kyali kiseera kibi nnyo.
He knew he needed to eat now.	Yali akimanyi nti kati yeetaaga okulya.
You won’t do it.	Tojja kukikola.
He certainly does.	Mazima ddala akikola.
But everyone said he was in jail.	Naye buli omu yagamba nti ali mu kkomera.
But, you know, that’s okay.	Naye, omanyi, ekyo si kibi.
It comes into existence.	Kijja mu kubeerawo.
This is really good.	Kino kirungi ddala.
And this is .	Era eno ye .
You’re in the classroom.	Oli mu kibiina.
I have always been desperate for money.	Bulijjo mbadde nfunye essuubi ku ssente.
She thought he might have been expecting someone else.	Yalowooza nti yandiba nga yali asuubira omuntu omulala.
He certainly couldn’t.	Mazima ddala yali tasobola.
It’s a place.	Kye kifo.
But that’s all we have of him.	Naye ekyo kyokka kye tulina ku ye.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe yali.
I'm sure someone can help.	Nkakasa nti waliwo asobola okuyamba.
But that’s not the case with me.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri gyendi.
I might have too.	Nze nange nnyinza okuba nga nnina.
Something was more complicated than it looked.	Ekintu kyali kizibu okusinga bwe kyali kirabika.
Now he is in a difficult place.	Kati ali mu kifo ekizibu.
There is nothing.	Tewali kintu kyonna.
I am alone now.	Nze kati ndi nzekka.
He always did well.	Bulijjo yakola bulungi.
This is what he was good at.	Kino kye yali mulungi mu.
Not always someone so young though.	Si bulijjo muntu muto bwatyo wadde.
I need a chance.	Nneetaaga omukisa.
He doesn’t want that any more than we do.	Ekyo tayagala okusinga ffe.
We were in danger.	Twali mu bulabe.
It’s easy to do.	Kyangu okukola.
Now his wife, she had a job.	Kati mukyala we, yalina omulimu.
That’s obviously not true.	Ekyo kya lwatu si kituufu.
But that is not the case here.	Naye wano si bwe kiri.
That was a terrible thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi nnyo.
I'm just asking.	Nze nsaba kyokka.
I have to get out of this.	Nnina okuva mu kino.
You knew better .	Ggwe wali omanyi bulungi .
It was dangerous.	Kyali kya bulabe.
Or that he had a plan.	Oba nti yalina enteekateeka.
I know this to be the case.	Kino nkimanyi nti bwe kiri.
But in my work, not so much.	Naye mu mulimu gwange, si nnyo.
My wife is the same.	Mukyala wange kye kimu.
Every hour, this is.	Buli ssaawa, kino kiri.
But there it is .	Naye awo we kiri .
I love being here.	Njagala nnyo okubeera wano.
He really does.	Ddala akola bw’atyo.
I'm sorry for all that.	Nsonyiwa ebyo byonna.
You are one of us now.	Oli omu ku ffe kati.
Everything is in place.	Buli kimu kiri mu kifo.
And not too many.	Era si bingi nnyo.
He doesn’t know, but he’s happy.	Tamanyi, naye nga musanyufu.
This is a child.	Oyo mwana.
I couldn’t find the right answer.	Nnali sisobola kufuna kya kuddamu kituufu.
I was that we.	Nze nali nti ffe.
To be my best self.	Okubeera omuntu wange asinga obulungi.
It’s not very good.	Si kirungi nnyo.
And that was a bad thing.	Era ekyo kyali kibi.
Always and alone.	Bulijjo era nga yekka.
The issue was money.	Ensonga yali ya ssente.
I can swim.	Nsobola okuwuga.
I’m in school.	Ndi mu ssomero.
It appears to be a man-made phenomenon.	Kirabika ekintu omuntu kye yakola.
For him, everything is fine.	Ku ye, buli kimu kiri bulungi.
More than me.	Okusinga nze.
He just has it.	Alina kyokka.
And soon he would be home.	Era mu bbanga ttono yandibadde awaka.
I wanted to be alone.	Nnali njagala kubeera nzekka.
I want strength for them.	Njagala amaanyi gye bali.
Not too bad but not too good.	Si kibi nnyo naye si kirungi nnyo.
It was home.	Yali waka.
This was not what it was.	Kino si kye kyali.
We can’t do it.	Tetusobola kukikola.
Or just you.	Oba ggwe wekka.
We were very busy, as well.	Twali bbize nnyo, nga bwe kiri.
He said he would see soon.	Yagambye nti mu bbanga ttono ajja kulaba.
I could win anything.	Nnali nsobola okuwangula ekintu kyonna.
Anything back home.	Ekintu kyonna okudda eka.
That’s right, we are.	Ekyo kituufu, tuli.
As it was at this time.	Nga bwe kyali mu kiseera kino.
He could come back anytime.	Yali asobola okudda essaawa yonna.
I wanted to know when.	Nnali njagala okumanya ddi.
He would be at home.	Yandibadde awaka.
You’re the only guy here he worked with.	Ggwe ggaayi wekka wano gwe yakola naye.
He tries to get out of the car.	Agezaako okuva mu mmotoka.
This would be normal.	Kino kyandibadde kya bulijjo.
Everyone should make a movie.	Buli omu yandibadde akola firimu.
And now .	Era kati .
I’ve been working on that.	Ekyo mbadde nkola ku nsonga eyo.
He always knew about everything.	Bulijjo yali amanyi ku buli kimu.
He is always human.	Bulijjo abeera muntu.
I was a young child.	Nnali mwana muto.
Maybe he tried but couldn’t.	Mpozzi yagezaako naye nga tasobola.
He says he could.	Agamba nti yali asobola.
That’s a lot of work.	Ekyo mulimu gwa maanyi.
And myself, of course.	Era nze kennyini, ddala.
However, this is not the point here.	Kyokka, eno si y’ensonga wano.
Like every day.	Nga buli lunaku.
He was being very nice to me.	Yali abeera mulungi nnyo gyendi.
He really makes my point.	Ddala akola ensonga yange.
And he probably was.	Era oboolyawo bwe yali.
Nothing bad is going to happen tomorrow.	Tewali kibi kigenda kubaawo enkya.
You are everything to me.	Ggwe buli kimu gyendi.
But that’s not the point.	Naye ekyo si kye kiri mu nsonga.
But we can find someone else.	Naye tusobola okufuna omuntu omulala.
I know he can.	Nkimanyi nti asobola.
She wanted in her room.	Yali ayagala mu kisenge kye.
It’s my city.	Kye kibuga kyange.
I have to go home now.	Nnina okudda eka kati.
He thinks it’s a group activity.	Alowooza nti mulimu gwa kibiina.
We need his home.	Twetaaga awaka we.
His dad was a thing.	Taata we yali kintu.
He will know exactly what to do.	Ajja kumanya bulungi ky’alina okukola.
This is going to be good.	Kino kigenda kuba kirungi.
Talking about something.	Okwogera ku kintu.
But they were both.	Naye baali bombi.
It’s hard to do.	Kizibu okukola.
No one really knows everything though.	Tewali amanyi ddala buli kimu wadde.
He wasn’t a kid.	Yali si mwana muto.
But he couldn’t see anything.	Naye yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
We will win.	Tujja kuwangula.
He wants his chance.	Ayagala omukisa gwe.
He could .	Yali asobola .
I am in trouble, a lot of trouble.	Ndi mu buzibu, obuzibu bungi.
He is my boyfriend.	Ye muganzi wange.
But that’s a good thing.	Naye ekyo kintu kirungi.
There was nothing he could do anyway.	Tewali kye yali asobola kukola mu ngeri yonna.
The movie would have been great.	Firimu yandibadde nnungi nnyo.
But now it was worse.	Naye kati kyali kibi nnyo.
I can’t quite believe it.	Siyinza bulungi kukkiriza.
And mostly in the morning.	Era okusinga ku makya.
He had his reasons.	Yalina ensonga ze.
Everything is so close.	Buli kimu kiri kumpi nnyo.
This is very powerful.	Kino kya maanyi nnyo.
I should do the same.	Nze kye kimu nsaanidde okukola.
He can do anything.	Asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
In his house.	Mu nnyumba ye.
Not easy, of course.	Si kyangu, ddala.
It was absolutely true.	Kyali kituufu ddala.
What he heard.	Kye yawulira.
He needs to go.	Yeetaaga okugenda.
You’ll see why.	Ojja kulaba lwaki.
I have to do a little more work now.	Nnina okukola omulimu omulala katono kati.
You love being me.	Oyagala nnyo okubeera nze.
She looks really good now.	Alabika bulungi ddala kati.
But he’s still young and that’s coming.	Naye akyali muto era ekyo kijja.
I think that's him.	Ndowooza oyo ye ye.
I didn’t know how to deal with myself.	Nnali simanyi ngeri ya kukola ku nze kennyini.
In fact, it’s not him at all.	Mu butuufu si ye n’akatono.
I never can, you know.	Sisobola n’akatono, omanyi.
He was obviously unhappy.	Kya lwatu nti yali si musanyufu.
He is a very young artist.	Ye muyimbi muto ddala.
It was probably pretty cool.	Oboolyawo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I didn’t think it would work.	Nnali sirowooza nti yandikoze.
That was good to see.	Ekyo kyali kirungi okulaba.
That was a bad thing.	Ekyo kyali kibi.
That is why this is important.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki kino kikulu.
I think that was the point.	Ndowooza eyo ye yali ensonga.
He was very good indeed.	Yali mulungi nnyo ddala.
That’s not a problem though.	Ekyo si kizibu wadde.
It's nowhere near.	Tewali we kiri kumpi ne.
It’s good, but that’s all.	Kirungi naye ekyo kyokka.
He was sound asleep.	Yali yeebase bulungi.
I won’t be able to attend.	Sijja kusobola kubeerawo.
It’s my problem.	Kizibu kyange.
We just have to wait.	Tulina kumala kulinda.
I have to see all that too.	Nange nnina okulaba ebyo byonna.
He would be an ordinary man.	Yandibadde musajja wa bulijjo.
He wasn’t the only one.	Si ye yali yekka.
I can’t go on now.	Sisobola kugenda mu maaso kati.
We don’t have it.	Tetulina.
Not a little bit about you.	Si katono ku ggwe.
He was there and safe.	Yali awo era nga talina bulabe.
No one can form such an opinion.	Tewali asobola kukola ndowooza ya ngeri eyo.
You know that yourself.	Ekyo ggwe kennyini okimanyi.
He did it for a while.	Yakikola okumala akaseera.
It seems unreal.	Kirabika nga si kya ddala.
He certainly has.	Mazima ddala alina.
I’m not sure if that’s good or bad.	Sikakasa oba ekyo kirungi oba kibi.
And I have no idea what to do.	Era sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kya kukola.
With no help from anyone but myself.	Nga tewali buyambi bwa muntu yenna okuggyako nze kennyini.
We’re going to play hard.	Tugenda kuzannya nnyo.
He had to do it.	Yalina okukikola.
Fortunately it isn’t.	Kirungi si bwe kiri.
It’s so easy.	Kyangu nnyo.
Getting to a certain point.	Okutuuka ku nsonga emu.
This is not always the case.	Kino si bwe kiri bulijjo.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
So much he knew.	Bingi nnyo bye yali amanyi.
That was a lucky bug.	Ekyo kyali kizibu kya mukisa.
He is not a threat to us.	Talina bulabe gye tuli.
Anyone can win.	Omuntu yenna asobola okuwangula.
He was a good teacher.	Yali musomesa mulungi.
Not all that much.	Si byonna ebyo bingi.
I have to help.	Nnina okuyamba.
And we have it.	Era tulina.
I really, really do.	Nze ddala, ddala nkola.
He has nothing on me.	Talina kintu kyonna ku nze.
I want to help.	Njagala kuyamba.
And just like you.	Era nga ggwe.
He needs to go.	Yeetaaga okugenda.
It was good, for a long time.	Kyali kirungi, okumala ebbanga ddene.
Very nice guy.	Omulungi ennyo.
He was as home as she had hoped.	Yali waka nga bwe yali asuubira.
He came to work in my office.	Yajja okukola mu ofiisi yange.
That’s not my position.	Ekyo si kye kifo kyange.
It was always true before.	Bulijjo kyali kituufu emabegako.
And that’s very unusual.	Era ekyo si kya bulijjo nnyo.
However, that was it.	Kyokka ekyo kye kyali.
We can see why.	Tusobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
He was just one person.	Yali muntu omu yekka.
He didn't know what to say.	Yali tamanyi kya kwogera.
There is no help there.	Tewali buyambi eyo.
That’s all there is.	Ekyo kyokka we kiri.
I have been thinking about this.	Kino mbadde ndowooza ku nsonga eno.
It will be great for me.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo gyendi.
But he knew it wouldn't work.	Naye yali akimanyi nti tekijja kukola.
You can’t do anything now.	Tosobola kukola kintu kyonna kati.
There's a lot, actually.	Waliwo bingi, mu butuufu.
But you can’t believe everything.	Naye tosobola kukkiriza buli kimu.
That's right, he's down here.	Ekyo kituufu, ali wansi wano.
It just won’t do it.	Tekijja kukikola kyokka.
However, it is not.	Kyokka, si bwe kiri.
I have one thing.	Nnina ekintu kimu.
It’s hard to see.	Kizibu okulaba.
I'm not sure, you know, exactly what he did.	Sikakasa, omanyi, ddala kye yakola.
I’m doing what every father would do.	Nze nkola buli taata kye yandikoze.
Almost everyone does the same thing.	Kumpi buli muntu akola ekintu kye kimu.
And it’s not good.	Era si kirungi.
That was the problem.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu.
I don’t have a good one for you right now.	Sirina mulungi gyoli mu kiseera kino.
It’s not dangerous.	Si kya bulabe.
You have to talk to me.	Olina okwogera nange.
And that’s all there is to it.	Era ekyo kyokka kye kiri.
He was probably there that night.	Oboolyawo yali awo ekiro ekyo.
But he must have been right about it.	Naye ateekwa okuba nga yali ayogera mazima ku nsonga eyo.
He knew he was strong.	Yali akimanyi nti wa maanyi.
And he couldn’t go with her.	Era yali tasobola kugenda naye.
I was really young.	Ddala nnali muto.
He wanted to hit something.	Yali ayagala okukuba ekintu.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
He knew exactly who he was.	Yali amanyi bulungi ani.
Probably at school.	Oboolyawo ku ssomero.
There isn’t just one.	Tewali kimu kyokka.
But we should too.	Naye naffe tusaanidde.
This isn’t a bad thing.	Kino si kibi.
No, he couldn’t do this.	Nedda, kino yali tasobola kukikola.
Only one book.	Ekitabo kimu kyokka.
He had slept all night in the car.	Yali yeebase ekiro kyonna mu mmotoka.
You have to talk a lot.	Olina okwogera ennyo.
His wife had so much.	Mukyala we yalina bingi nnyo.
There is nothing in this.	Tewali kintu kyonna mu kino.
I hope someone can help.	Nsuubira waliwo asobola okuyamba.
That’s not really true.	Ekyo mu butuufu si kituufu.
Not even talking to you.	Si wadde okwogera naawe.
I think he is very good.	Ndowooza mulungi nnyo.
Almost every day.	Kumpi buli lunaku.
You are a singer.	Oli muyimbi.
He certainly loves it.	Mazima ddala ayagala nnyo.
It doesn’t matter where.	Si kikulu wa.
He knew it well enough.	Yali akimanyi bulungi.
For us together.	Ku ffe nga tuli wamu.
I feel so desperate.	Mpulira nga nfunye essuubi ddene.
A really really nice guy.	Ggaayi omulungi ddala ddala.
He needed this.	Kino yali yeetaaga.
He was a really nice brother.	Yali muganda mulungi ddala.
That’s what he told me.	Ekyo kye yang’amba.
Now you’re working.	Kati ggwe okola.
He obviously knew it.	Kya lwatu yali akimanyi.
I love this product.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino.
Very very very very.	Ennyo nnyo nnyo.
He probably couldn’t do it.	Oboolyawo yali tasobola kukikola.
She is his girlfriend.	Ye muganzi we.
I don’t know how to talk to him.	Simanyi ngeri ya kwogera naye.
You may have it.	Oyinza okuba nga olina.
Everyone started to leave.	Buli omu yatandika okugenda.
This is not always true.	Kino si kituufu bulijjo.
But there was no way he could do this himself.	Naye tewali ngeri yonna gye yali asobola kukola kino ye kennyini.
You have to read the book.	Olina okusoma ekitabo.
He went a little faster.	Yagenda mu bwangu katono.
But that’s not my point.	Naye ekyo si nsonga yange.
He did an excellent job.	Yakola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
I'll have to go.	Nja kuba nnina okugenda.
You have to do that.	Ekyo olina okukikola.
Here,’ he said.	Wano,’ bwe yagambye.
When he was not with her .	Bwe yali tali naye .
I didn’t want a child.	Nnali saagala mwana.
Not now, not ever.	Si kati, si mu kiseera kyonna.
And he was her.	Era ye yali ye.
He started reluctantly.	Yatandika nga tayagala.
I have to get some food.	Nnina okufuna emmere.
He is the power.	Ye maanyi.
He was close.	Yali kumpi.
He works well in every situation.	Akola bulungi mu buli mbeera.
He must be the only one.	Ateekwa okuba nga ye yekka.
There is so much more.	Waliwo bingi nnyo.
And we will be there.	Era tujja kubeerawo.
Not now, too early.	Si kati, nga bukyali nnyo.
That’s probably not good.	Ekyo osanga si kirungi.
You may know that too.	Ekyo naawe oyinza okuba nga okimanyi.
What he was.	Kye yali.
No one expected that to be easy.	Tewali yali asuubira nti ekyo kijja kuba kyangu.
All he got was a car.	Kye yafuna mmotoka.
Then he said, you are a teacher.	Awo n’agamba nti, oli musomesa.
Today he was going to school too.	Leero naye yali agenda ku ssomero.
That he must go to them.	Nti alina okugenda gye bali.
He was a doctor.	Yali musawo.
I don’t have time for a boyfriend.	Sirina budde bwa muganzi.
Somewhere there though and.	Waliwo awo wadde ne.
He doesn't know what to do.	Tamanyi kya kukola.
He is in the foreground.	Ali mu maaso.
I'm with you.	Nze nange.
No one lives there.	Tewali muntu yenna abeera eyo.
But he didn’t know.	Naye yali tamanyi.
You’re not you.	Ggwe si gwe.
And it’s so bad.	Era kibi nnyo.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
I really don’t know what to say.	Mazima ddala simanyi kya kwogera.
He preferred to do anything quickly.	Yali asinga kwagala kukola kintu kyonna mu bwangu.
He knew now what that book of his was.	Yali amanyi kati ekitabo kye ekyo kye kyali.
Is that really so bad for me?.	Ddala ekyo kibi nnyo gyendi?.
In a way this is a good thing.	Mu ngeri emu kino kintu kirungi.
Everyone was in good shape.	Buli omu yali mu mbeera nnungi.
But it’s the police.	Naye ye poliisi.
I love doing that.	Ekyo njagala nnyo okukikola.
He wanted to be with her again.	Yali ayagala okuddamu okubeera naye.
I really need help.	Nze nneetaaga nnyo obuyambi.
There are so many things.	Ebintu bingi nnyo.
He didn't want to know now.	Yali tayagala kumanya kati.
Just thinking about something, that’s all.	Okulowooza ku kintu kyokka, ekyo kyokka.
Whatever they are.	Kyonna kye bali.
It may be enough.	Kiyinza okumala.
It’s not dangerous.	Si kya bulabe.
Nothing was easy.	Tewali kintu kyonna kyali kyangu.
It’s not the same at all.	Si kye kimu n’akatono.
And we will be there to help.	Era tujja kubeerawo okuyamba.
This is, of course, true.	Kino, kya lwatu, kituufu.
On the subject.	Ku nsonga.
You’ll be just fine.	Ojja kuba bulungi nnyo.
I will never do it again.	Sijja kuddamu kukikola.
You are alone and safe.	Oli wekka era nga tolina bulabe.
She almost had him, too.	Kumpi yalina naye, naye.
You don’t want to be.	Toyagala kubeera.
The money we need.	Ssente ze twetaaga.
He's not the only one, of course.	Si ye yekka, ddala.
It is very, very important.	Kikulu nnyo nnyo.
He lives here.	Ye abeera wano.
I am a woman.	Nze ndi mukyala.
I can’t do this, he thought.	Kino sisobola kukikola, bwe yalowooza.
Everyone is fine, actually.	Buli muntu ali bulungi, mu butuufu.
I was at work.	Nnali ku mulimu.
We're going downstairs.	Tugenda wansi.
But you have had .	Naye ggwe obadde ne .
That’s what it is, of course.	Ekyo kye kiri, ddala.
But not close.	Naye si kumpi.
Now it’s nothing.	Kati si kintu kyonna.
He was asleep, and he shouldn’t be doing that.	Yali yeebase, era ekyo tasaanidde kukikola.
I didn’t know how to do that.	Ekyo nnali simanyi ngeri ya kukikola.
I wonder why he has this plan.	Nze nneebuuza lwaki alina enteekateeka eno.
I have a problem here.	Nnina ekizibu wano.
You don’t know what you want.	Tomanyi kyoyagala.
But he is not that kind of man.	Naye si musajja wa ngeri eyo.
This is nearly there.	Kino kiri kumpi awo.
I have something to do.	Nnina kye nnina okukola.
I wanted to.	Nnali njagala.
He was too busy to work.	Yali bbize nnyo okukola.
You know how that is.	Omanyi engeri ekyo gye kiri.
I know what that thing was.	Nkimanyi ekintu ekyo kye kyali.
There is no there there.	Tewali awo awo.
He still couldn’t believe it.	Yali n’okutuusa kati yali tasobola kukkiriza.
Not everyone is ready to make this assumption.	Si buli muntu nti mwetegefu okukola endowooza eno.
Maybe it's bad.	Mpozzi nga kibi.
He won't come.	Tajja kujja.
It would be his job to do.	Kye kyandibadde omulimu gwe okukola.
I was very happy with him.	Nali musanyufu nnyo naye.
It may not be the case.	Kiyinza okuba nti si bwe kiri.
That was my opinion.	Eyo ye yali endowooza yange.
I still couldn’t find a job.	N’okutuusa kati nnali sisobola kufuna mulimu.
Neither of them is.	Bombi si bwe bali.
He felt they were close.	Yawulira nga bali kumpi.
It would be nice.	Kyandibadde kirungi.
My opinion is completely mine.	Endowooza yange yange ddala.
Everyone is going to be fine.	Buli omu agenda kuba bulungi.
And then this whole thing .	Era awo ekintu kino kyonna .
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
But for something like this, it's fine.	Naye ku kintu nga kino, kirungi.
But he knew it.	Naye yali akimanyi.
This he had to do one thing.	Kino yalina okukola ekintu kimu.
You could probably say that you have too.	Oboolyawo oyinza okugamba nti naawe obadde naawe.
I love the house.	Njagala nnyo ennyumba.
But so are all of us.	Naye naffe ffenna bwe tuli.
It’s the same as you .	Kye kimu nga ggwe .
However, it is bad for one thing.	Kyokka, kibi nnyo ku kintu kimu.
His reason was with her.	Ensonga ye yali naye.
But it is very important.	Naye kikulu nnyo.
And here they are now.	Era wano we bali kati.
Of course, he would.	Kya lwatu nti yandikoze.
I don’t really like it.	Sikyagala nnyo.
However, this is not all.	Kyokka, bino si byonna.
We’re pretty good here.	Tuli bulungi nnyo wano.
But it can happen.	Naye kiyinza okubaawo.
I would say, no, no no.	Nze n’agamba nti, nedda, nedda nedda.
But that’s not quite right.	Naye ekyo si kituufu nnyo.
In a sense, though, it is true.	Kyokka mu ngeri emu kituufu.
He's a father.	Ye taata.
I’ve been thinking about it too.	Nze nange mbadde ndowooza ku nsonga eyo.
I’m just a normal guy.	Nze ndi ggaayi wa bulijjo yekka.
Everything looks good and everything is good.	Buli kimu kirabika bulungi era buli kimu kirungi.
He used to think so.	Yali atera okulowooza bw’atyo.
He has been her friend.	Abadde mukwano gwe.
I am all those things.	Nze ebintu ebyo byonna.
I could get another one.	Nnali nsobola okufuna omulala.
Not as it seems.	Si nga bwe kirabika.
That, he couldn’t do.	Ekyo, yali tasobola kukikola.
Now there is only one problem.	Kati waliwo ekizibu kimu kyokka.
He had been alone.	Yali abadde yekka.
And you won’t do it again.	Era tojja kuddamu kukikola.
I can’t wait to do that.	Ekyo siyinza kulinda kukola.
This is very simple.	Kino kyangu nnyo.
However, it was also true.	Kyokka era kyali kituufu.
This is a very serious policy issue.	Eno nsonga ya nkola ya maanyi nnyo.
I won’t be here.	Sijja kubeera wano.
Being a powerful place.	Okubeera kifo kya maanyi.
Then another one.	Awo omulala.
I knew what to expect there.	Nnali mmanyi kye nsuubira eyo.
It had to be close.	Kyalina okuba nga kiri kumpi.
That is not uncommon.	Ekyo si kya bulijjo.
Apparently it was.	Kirabika bwe kyali.
And yet he couldn't believe that either.	Era naye era ekyo yali tasobola kukkiriza.
You don’t have to wait for that.	Ekyo tolina kulinda.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
And you will be lucky.	Era ojja kuba mukisa.
He wants to work.	Ayagala ku mulimu.
No one knew how bad it would be.	Tewali yali amanyi ngeri gye kyandibadde kibi.
It’s hard for me.	Kizibu gyendi.
I’ve got to do it better.	Nze nfunye okukikola obulungi.
It will help everyone.	Kijja kuyamba buli muntu.
He will be truthful.	Ajja kuba wa mazima.
And he works hard.	Era ye akola nnyo.
No real problem there.	Tewali buzibu bwa ddala eyo.
He was a pleasure to work with.	Yali musanyufu nnyo okukola naye.
You don’t know at all.	Tomanyi n’akatono.
He and I were, alone.	Nze naye twali, nzekka.
I don’t want to see that thing again.	Saagala kuddamu kulaba kintu ekyo.
You have to go to school.	Olina okugenda ku ssomero.
And this is wrong.	Era kino kibi.
I knew better now.	Nze nnali mmanyi bulungi kati.
But he could have.	Naye yali asobola.
He did really well.	Yakola bulungi ddala.
I love to work.	Njagala nnyo okukola.
I'll be back soon.	Nja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
He was a human being, just like us.	Yali muntu, nga ffe.
We will do this again.	Kino tujja kuddamu okukikola.
I knew perfectly well.	Nnali mmanyi bulungi ddala.
He had been so low.	Yali abadde wansi nnyo.
I could be in jail right now.	Nnyinza okuba mu kkomera mu kiseera kino.
But, it’s also not easy to do.	Naye, era si kyangu kukikola.
But he would have to do the same.	Naye naye yandibadde alina okukola ekintu kye kimu.
Maybe that will happen.	Mpozzi ekyo kijja kubaawo.
It looks good on him.	Kirabika bulungi ku ye.
Not so today.	Si bwe kiri leero.
He is very sick.	Mulwadde nnyo.
We have no problems with each other.	Tetulina buzibu bwonna ku buli omu.
They were there, they were friends.	Baali awo, baali ba mukwano.
And he probably didn't know much much anyway.	Era oboolyawo yali tamanyi bingi bingi mu ngeri yonna.
However, I would love to see him make one.	Kyokka njagala nnyo okulaba ng’akola emu.
I am all of these.	Nze bino byonna.
My brother was also a very good player.	Muganda wange naye yali muzannyi mulungi nnyo.
And it’s not just that.	Era si ekyo kyokka.
I need a .	Nze nneetaaga .
I just want to be happy.	Njagala kubeera musanyufu kyokka.
I wasn’t sure how to do this.	Kino nnali sikakasa ngeri ya kukikola.
But he couldn’t, of course.	Naye yali tasobola, ddala.
He just isn’t.	Ye yekka si bwe kiri.
He is in this movie.	Ali mu firimu eno.
It’s the time now.	Kye kiseera kati.
He told me he did.	Yang’amba nti yakikola.
That’s what we have here.	Ekyo kye tulina wano.
But, but, but .	Naye, naye, naye .
But no one can do that.	Naye ekyo tewali asobola kukikola.
But it is not at all.	Naye si bwe kiri n’akatono.
The guy is actually pretty good.	Mu butuufu ggaayi oyo mulungi nnyo.
It’s bad, but it’s very true.	Kibi, naye kituufu nnyo.
That’s a real problem for theory.	Ekyo kizibu kya ddala eri endowooza.
But for a little while.	Naye akaseera katono.
Probably not, but you might get lucky.	Oboolyawo si bwe kiri, naye oyinza okufuna omukisa.
Working in your own way.	Okukola mu ngeri yo.
You were exactly what he needed.	Ggwe ddala gwe yali yeetaaga.
It would be nice, that's what.	Kyandibadde kirungi, ekyo kye ki.
It’s not good.	Si kirungi.
Not that though.	Si ekyo wadde.
A really good job.	Omulimu omulungi ddala.
He doesn’t need money.	Teyeetaaga ssente.
You don’t want to.	Toyagala.
Anyone can do this, anyone.	Kino omuntu yenna asobola okukikola, omuntu yenna.
But this will do for now.	Naye kino kijja kukola ku kiseera kino.
It’s not my thing.	Si kintu kyange.
And they were always together.	Era bulijjo baali wamu.
It is a beautiful city.	Kibuga kirungi nnyo.
I was so desperate.	Nnali nfunye essuubi nnyo.
And he needed to do it.	Era yali yeetaaga okukikola.
He was here to do a job, true.	Yali wano okukola omulimu, kituufu.
You’ll go home now.	Ojja kudda eka kati.
That’s definitely not you.	Ekyo mazima ddala si ggwe.
I will find another job.	Nja kufuna omulimu omulala.
But not in that case.	Naye si mu mbeera eyo.
Not all the time, of course.	Si kiseera kyonna, ddala.
That’s just true.	Ekyo kituufu kyokka.
I hope you love it!.	Nsuubira nti oyagala nnyo!.
Probably in his car.	Oboolyawo mu mmotoka ye.
You will have to work a little harder than usual.	Ojja kuba olina okukola ennyo katono okusinga bulijjo.
He would have been very happy.	Yandibadde musanyufu nnyo.
I was thinking ahead.	Nnali ndowooza mu maaso.
It’s hard for me to go anywhere.	Kizibu gyendi okugenda yonna.
But it’s really the same thing.	Naye ddala kintu kye kimu.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
It doesn’t really matter.	Si kikulu nnyo.
Everything is one place.	Buli kimu kifo kimu.
This alone will not be enough.	Kino kyokka tekijja kumala.
Either way, he was safe now.	Mu ngeri yonna, kati yali talina bulabe.
I can’t do it myself.	Nze kennyini sisobola kukikola.
Perhaps he had been.	Oboolyawo yali abadde.
Another one goes.	Omulala agenda.
Home is very close.	Awaka ali kumpi nnyo.
There is no organization.	Tewali kibiina kiri.
But, in reality, he wasn’t.	Naye, mu butuufu, si bwe yali.
That’s all he wants.	Ekyo kyokka ky’ayagala.
Everyone has something they want.	Buli muntu alina ky’ayagala.
I know this is easy for you.	Nkimanyi nti kino kyangu gy’oli.
But this was fine.	Naye kino kyali kirungi.
Almost no one was talking.	Kumpi tewali yali ayogera.
Not now and not about this.	Si kati era si ku nsonga eno.
You were there.	Ggwe wali eyo.
Maybe this is a bad idea.	Mpozzi kino kirowoozo kibi.
He would be alone.	Yandibadde yekka.
He was expecting.	Yali asuubira.
Probably someone.	Oboolyawo muntu.
He said he could.	Yagambye nti asobola.
I think we should talk.	Ndowooza tusaanidde okwogera.
As a person.	Nga omuntu.
It is true at the moment.	Kituufu mu kiseera kino.
One point at a time.	Ensonga emu ku emu.
It’s not a way at all.	Si ngeri n’akatono.
These are my thoughts.	Bino bye ndowooza.
He knows better than anyone.	Amanyi okusinga omuntu yenna.
And that’s fine, actually.	Era ekyo kirungi, mu butuufu.
He doesn't know why now.	Tamanyi lwaki kati.
Not everyone is happy about that.	Ekyo si buli muntu nti musanyufu.
But you can’t go on with that.	Naye ekyo tosobola kugenda mu maaso.
I know you’re happy.	Nkimanyi nti oli musanyufu.
It’s just what we are right now.	Kye tuli kyokka mu kiseera kino.
There, someone is coming.	Eyo, waliwo omuntu ajja.
I honestly have no idea how to do something like that.	Mu butuufu sirina kirowoozo ku ngeri ya kukola kintu ng’ekyo.
He is not from here.	Si wa wano.
he was curious.	yali ayagala okumanya.
Not that we were safe, of course.	Si nti twali tetulina bulabe, ddala.
This is a serious and costly problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo era kya ssente nnyingi.
And there’s something in that.	Era waliwo ekintu mu ekyo.
It’s not bad, either.	Si kibi, era.
He knew he had to go.	Yali akimanyi nti alina okugenda.
He was just being truthful.	Yali kumala kuba wa mazima.
He knew what we were capable of.	Yali amanyi kye twali tusobola.
I want this here.	Kino njagala wano.
And he will do it.	Era ajja kukikola.
But, it was to help his friends.	Naye, kyali kya kuyamba mikwano gye.
He is not well.	Tali bulungi.
You will be happy.	Ojja kuba musanyufu.
But it isn’t either.	Naye era si bwe kiri.
Good, but not sick.	Kirungi, naye si mulwadde.
I thought he should have done it.	Nalowooza nti yandibadde akikola.
Working without thought.	Okukola nga tolina ndowooza.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
It was a sin.	Kyali kibi.
I don’t know how to say this thing.	Simanyi ngeri ya kwogera kintu kino.
But we were down.	Naye twali wansi.
He was anyone.	Yali muntu yenna.
But he was alone, of course.	Naye yali yekka, ddala.
I'll know.	Nja kumanya.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
I don’t want to be here myself.	Nze kennyini saagala kubeera wano.
Not for that reason .	Si lwa nsonga eyo .
If only he had heard.	Singa yawulira.
He could see why.	Yali asobola okulaba ensonga lwaki.
I know it’s not my business.	Nkimanyi nti si nsonga yange.
He's not a man.	Si musajja.
He had a phone.	Yalina essimu.
He will never live this way.	Tajja kubeera mu ngeri eno.
No one has a job.	Tewali alina mulimu.
I won’t tell anyone.	Sijja kubuulira muntu yenna.
He went quickly.	Yagenda mu bwangu.
I didn’t know what I wanted.	Nnali simanyi kye njagala.
This is really important.	Kino kikulu nnyo ddala.
That was a good and bad time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kirungi era kibi.
There is no house for me.	Tewali nnyumba yange.
He had a job to do.	Yalina omulimu gwe yakola.
Since you .	Okuva bwe kiri nti ggwe .
I wonder how long this can last.	Nneebuuza nti kino kiyinza okumala ebbanga ki.
Everyone in the room knew it.	Buli muntu mu kisenge yali akimanyi.
And he would be here alone.	Era yandibadde wano yekka.
I thought that was realistic.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kyali kya ddala.
What you wanted.	Kye wali oyagala.
In a sense, they were.	Mu ngeri emu, baali.
He has everything.	Alina buli kimu.
I could have gone on.	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu maaso.
He was really good at that.	Ekyo yali mulungi ddala.
But also, everyone has their own opinion.	Naye era, buli muntu alina endowooza ye.
He has three.	Alina ssatu.
There are no cars here.	Wano tewali mmotoka.
She wanted to be near him.	Yali ayagala kubeera kumpi naye.
That’s all he wants.	Ekyo kyokka ky’ayagala.
He is here though.	Ali wano wadde.
It could be anything.	Kiyinza okuba kyonna.
My wife did the same.	Mukyala wange bwe yakola.
He looks strong.	Alabika nga wa maanyi.
I know this is hard.	Nkimanyi kino kizibu.
For me it was a bit of a stretch.	Nze kyali kizibu katono.
This is normal.	Kino kya bulijjo.
We can move forward.	Tusobola okugenda mu maaso.
You said it wasn’t.	Wagamba nti si bwe kiri.
He wants to go.	Ayagala kugenda.
He is everywhere.	Ali buli wamu.
In every relationship.	Mu buli mukwano.
That was a very difficult time.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
And now he was really done.	Era kati ddala yali amaze.
This will be important soon.	Kino kijja kuba kikulu mu bbanga ttono.
I'm going with you.	Nze ngenda naawe.
We have no time, no space.	Tetulina budde, tetulina kifo.
This is very true.	Kino kituufu nnyo.
You are really sick.	Ddala oli mulwadde.
Now he's coming.	Kati ajja.
He is really among his friends now as well.	Ddala ali mu mikwano gye kati naye.
That would probably be it.	Ekyo osanga kye kyandibadde.
Now there is nothing.	Kati tewali kintu kyonna.
I hope you like it.	Nsuubira nti oyagala.
Anyone can do things.	Omuntu yenna asobola okukola ebintu.
But since that time we have.	Naye okuva mu kiseera ekyo tulina.
I’m not sure that would be my thing.	Sikakasa nti ekyo kyandibadde kintu kyange.
It wasn’t my approach.	Si kye kyali nkola yange.
And he should have done.	Era yandibadde akola.
But moving forward .	Naye okugenda mu maaso .
Not at all.	Si bwe kiri n’akatono.
He'll do better on that.	Ajja kukola bulungi ku ekyo.
I really need to work on this.	Kino nneetaaga nnyo okukola ku nsonga eno.
At the moment there is no one.	Mu kiseera kino tewali muntu yenna.
I’m sure you will.	Nkakasa nti ojja kukikola.
You don’t have to go now.	Tolina kugenda kati.
He knew who he was.	Yali amanyi ani gwe yali.
And not only that .	Era si ekyo kyokka .
Tonight we will be .	Ekiro kya leero tujja kuba .
I don’t want to know anything about him.	Saagala kumanya kintu kyonna ku ye.
He looked so normal.	Yalabika nga wa bulijjo nnyo.
I am this whole thing.	Nze ekintu kino kyonna.
I don’t want this.	Kino saagala.
And that wasn’t the only problem.	Era ekyo si kye kyokka kye kyali ekizibu.
But this isn’t true for everyone.	Naye kino si kituufu ku buli muntu.
We must move forward together or not at all.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso nga tuli wamu oba nedda n’akatono.
This is what he needed.	Kino kye yali yeetaaga.
It is absolutely true.	Kituufu ddala.
Any picture will do.	Ekifaananyi kyonna kijja kukola.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
Would that be too hard?.	Ekyo kyandibadde kizibu nnyo?.
He knew he wasn’t a good teacher.	Yali akimanyi nti si musomesa mulungi.
Maybe soon though.	Mpozzi mu bbanga ttono wadde.
He knew so much.	Yali amanyi bingi nnyo.
It's just my friend.	Mukwano gwange yekka.
It probably won’t.	Oboolyawo tekijja kukikola.
He was nowhere and nothing.	Yali talina we yali era nga talina kintu kyonna.
He hoped she wouldn't agree.	Yalina essuubi nti tajja kukkiriza.
He really wanted that thing.	Ekintu ekyo yali ayagala nnyo.
But you don’t really know yourself.	Naye mu butuufu tomanyi ggwe kennyini.
I think you look great.	Ndowooza olabika bulungi nnyo.
I just wanted to do it.	Nnali njagala kukikola kyokka.
It’s not like it’s in good shape, either.	Si nga bwe kiri mu mbeera nnungi, era.
He needed to be good.	Yali yeetaaga okuba omulungi.
She is that beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo bw’atyo.
My wife and I.	Nze ne mukyala wange.
No, because that’s it.	Nedda, kuba ekyo.
He was a strong man.	Yali musajja wa maanyi.
Not a good option though.	Si nkola nnungi wadde.
It will help.	Kijja kuyamba.
You are everywhere.	Oli buli wamu.
This was the whole reason they were here.	Eno ye yali ensonga yonna lwaki baali wano.
He could not continue his work.	Yali tasobola kugenda mu maaso na mulimu gwe.
I could hardly believe it.	Nnali sisobola bulungi kukkiriza.
That’s easy to see.	Ekyo kyangu okulaba.
And he started making money fast.	Era yatandika okukola ssente mu bwangu.
I can talk to him.	Nsobola okwogera naye.
I have to get back to work.	Nnina okudda ku mulimu.
He had to go.	Yalina okugenda.
That will never happen again.	Ekyo tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
This is the good thing.	Kino kye kirungi.
I think he was happy.	Ndowooza yali musanyufu.
. . . .	.
This is simply not true.	Kino kyokka si kituufu.
My father saw an opportunity.	Taata yalaba omukisa.
I really didn’t want to know.	Mu butuufu nnali saagala kumanya.
It was very fast.	Yali ya mangu nnyo.
It probably won’t happen.	Oboolyawo tekijja kubaawo.
He was with his wife.	Yali ne mukyala we.
But no, he thought.	Naye nedda, bwe yalowooza.
But he knew what she was thinking.	Naye yali amanyi kye yali alowooza.
He spoke a lot.	Yayogera nnyo.
And, you know, it's hard.	Era, omanyi, kizibu.
You are your best self.	Ggwe ggwe kennyini asinga obulungi.
I suppose that was good.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kyali kirungi.
And he does it very well.	Era akikola bulungi nnyo.
We have a good chance.	Tulina omukisa omulungi.
That’s what this is.	Ekyo kino kye kiri.
He was a man.	Yali musajja.
So was my father.	Bw’atyo ne taata wange bwe yali.
I want to do it soon.	Njagala okukikola amangu.
He just wanted to be alone.	Yali ayagala kubeera yekka yekka.
One per day.	Omu buli lunaku.
He's doing really well, too.	Akola bulungi ddala, naye.
This is really normal.	Kino ddala kya bulijjo.
It's not a cow.	Si waka.
Maybe he knew this.	Mpozzi kino yali akimanyi.
But it’s coming soon!.	Naye kijja mangu!.
But not every day.	Naye si buli lunaku.
Mostly when it’s good.	Okusinga nga kirungi.
I just wanted to know.	Nnali njagala kumanya kyokka.
You know where they are.	Omanyi gye bali.
He's always done it before.	Bulijjo abadde akikola emabegako.
I'm glad you're here!.	Ndi musanyufu nti oli wano!.
He is talking to you.	Ayogera naawe.
And no one was.	Era tewali muntu yenna yali.
I can do whatever you want.	Nsobola okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
We’re all very good friends.	Tuli ba mukwano nnyo ffenna.
And cheerful and eager to help.	Era nga musanyufu era nga ayagala nnyo okuyamba.
He did this very well.	Kino yakikola bulungi nnyo.
You know he will.	Omanyi ajja kukikola.
Unless it was .	Okuggyako nga kyali .
Now they’re friends, apparently.	Kati ba mukwano, kirabika.
He was coming with me.	Yali ajja nange.
He has been one.	Abadde omu.
I don’t want that for us either.	Ekyo nange saagala ku ffe.
But he saw something in you .	Naye yalaba ekintu mu ggwe .
He agreed to do it.	Yakkiriza okukikola.
Maybe that’s my problem.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kizibu kyange.
He seemed reluctant.	Yalabika nga tayagala.
However, we don’t have to deal with that.	Kyokka, tetulina kukola ku nsonga eyo.
That's the reason.	Y'ensonga.
Not that he wanted to admit that.	Si nti ekyo yali ayagala kukkiriza.
And you do things.	Era ggwe okola ebintu.
Everyone can do what they want to do.	Buli muntu asobola okukola ky’ayagala okukola.
It looks pretty good to me.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo gyendi.
I could deal with this.	Kino nnali nsobola okukola ku nsonga eno.
This doesn’t really come into play much.	Kino mu butuufu tekijja nnyo mu nkola.
I hope always you .	Nsuubira bulijjo ggwe .
Now you look great.	Kati olabika bulungi nnyo.
We both needed this.	Kino ffembi twali twetaaga.
Tomorrow, he thought.	Enkya, bwe yalowooza.
It was a reason.	Yali nsonga.
I really don’t know.	Mazima ddala simanyi.
I know you know it.	Nkimanyi nti okimanyi.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
In fact, he spoke a little early.	Mu butuufu, yayogera nga bukyali katono.
We can do it, we must.	Tusobola okukikola, tulina.
He knew that was dangerous.	Yali akimanyi nti ekyo kyali kya bulabe.
This was bad on his part.	Kino kyali kibi ku ludda lwe.
I am my own person.	Nze ndi muntu wange.
As he was.	Nga bwe yali.
You have to make a point.	Olina okukola ensonga.
I hope not much.	Nsuubira si bingi.
This was what he did.	Kino kye kyali kye yakola.
I think that was his plan.	Ndowooza eyo ye yali enteekateeka ye.
He is not in prison.	Tali mu kkomera.
Maybe this week it will.	Mpozzi wiiki eno kijja kubaawo.
It is much easier to read well that way.	Kyangu nnyo okusoma obulungi mu ngeri eyo.
It's almost here.	Kiri kumpi wano.
And there are .	Era waliwo .
What is that? 	Kiki ekyo?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
He was happy to be home.	Yali musanyufu okuba awaka.
This was completely untrue.	Kino kyali si kituufu ddala.
Soon you will be there.	Mu bbanga ttono ojja kubeerawo.
Hitting someone is wrong.	Okukuba omuntu kibi.
If he had to do it.	Singa yalina okukikola.
You don’t know what to say.	Tomanyi kya kwogera.
He won’t play my way.	Tajja kuzannya mu ngeri yange.
He spoke to her.	Yayogera naye.
It will always be there.	Bulijjo kijja kubaawo.
We can have an early dinner.	Tusobola okulya ekyeggulo nga bukyali.
That's what he is.	Ekyo ky'ali.
What is the reason.	Ensonga ki.
I think he's coming this week.	Ndowooza ajja wiiki eno.
I’m here for the day.	Nze ndi wano ku lunaku.
This thing is going on.	Ekintu kino kigenda mu maaso.
They were everything but.	Baali buli kintu kyonna naye.
But nothing was as good.	Naye tewali kyali kirungi nga bwe kiri.
I will never try again.	Sijja kuddamu kugezaako.
But now we have this problem.	Naye kati tulina ekizibu kino.
He has it in him.	Alina mu ye.
Or maybe it was what he did.	Oba oboolyawo kyali kye yakola.
You look beautiful.	Olabika bulungi.
But he was her father.	Naye yali taata we.
He knows that for sure.	Ekyo akimanyi ddala.
I’m having trouble eating.	Nze nfunye obuzibu okulya.
This work is a work in progress.	Omulimu guno gwa kukola.
And it was true, too.	Era kyali kituufu, era.
Or it can backfire.	Oba kiyinza okudda emabega.
This was a common practice.	Eno yali nkola ya bulijjo.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ekyo kye kituufu.
Although .	Wadde nga .
I have been thinking only of myself.	Mbadde ndowooza ku nze nzekka.
That was good at that.	Ekyo yali mulungi mu ekyo.
But he won’t talk to you.	Naye tajja kwogera naawe.
You really have to go.	Ddala olina okugenda.
He often eats a lot.	Atera kulya nnyo.
He wasn’t going to do that.	Ekyo yali tagenda kukikola.
But of course he had a point.	Naye ddala yalina ensonga.
To me he looked the same.	Eri nze yali alabika kye kimu.
It is very important to do well.	Kikulu nnyo okukola obulungi.
Not doing that.	Obutakola ekyo.
Everything looks good.	Buli kimu kirabika kirungi.
He was good at his job.	Yali mulungi mu mulimu gwe.
You can’t win with me.	Tosobola kuwangula nange.
Unable to really go on.	Nga tasobola ddala kugenda mu maaso.
But the same thing.	Naye ekintu kye kimu.
But not about that now.	Naye kati si ku nsonga eyo.
The phone was really everywhere.	Ddala essimu yali buli wamu.
No telling why.	Tewali kubuulira lwaki.
She was so nice and down to earth.	Yali mulungi nnyo era nga wa wansi.
I was so scared.	Nnali ntya nnyo.
That’s where we are at home.	Awo we tuli awaka.
I was in a hurry.	Nali mu bwangu.
And he couldn’t do that.	Era ekyo yali tasobola kukikola.
Wa wa	Wa wa .
Where we go from here is below.	Gye tugenda okuva wano wa wansi.
I was always alone.	Bulijjo nnali ndi nzekka.
That, of course, is critical.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kikulu nnyo.
And yes, we need hope, we really do.	Era ye, twetaaga essuubi, ddala twetaaga.
It will be difficult.	Kijja kuba kizibu.
All by himself.	Byonna ye kennyini.
I hear you .	Mpulira ggwe .
The thing is there really is nothing to gain.	Ekintu kiri nti ddala tewali kya kufuna.
But it was great to have her here.	Naye kyali kirungi nnyo okubeera naye wano.
Then it wasn’t.	Awo si bwe kyali.
You have to say no.	Olina okugamba nti nedda.
As it was then.	Nga bwe kyali mu kiseera ekyo.
It’s good in that sense.	Kirungi mu ngeri eyo.
He just wanted to talk to her.	Yali ayagala kwogera naye kyokka.
What we have.	Kye tulina.
It’s up to all of us.	Kiri ku ffe ffenna.
I couldn’t believe it, to myself or to him.	Nnali sisobola kukkiriza, eri nze kennyini oba eri ye.
I’m sorry about that, but there it is.	Nsonyiwa ku nsonga eyo, naye awo we kiri.
He's a good child.	Mwana mulungi.
I didn’t want to see.	Nnali saagala kulaba.
I love these very much.	Bino njagala nnyo.
I'll move on.	Nja kugenda mu maaso.
One could easily spend a week here.	Omuntu yali asobola bulungi okumala wano wiiki emu.
And nothing, really, no one can do about it.	Era tewali, ddala, tewali muntu yenna ayinza kukola ku nsonga eyo.
He said, he would.	Yagamba nti, yandibadde.
And, by all means .	Era, mu ngeri yonna .
He was a very loving man.	Yali musajja ayagala nnyo.
The hour is near.	Essaawa eri kumpi.
The work is the thing.	Omulimu gwe kintu.
I just wanted to be with me.	Nnali njagala kubeera nange kyokka.
I am nothing like him.	Nze siri kintu kyonna nga ye.
He is the problem.	Ye kizibu.
You can’t do that.	Ekyo tosobola kukikola.
He needs a job.	Yeetaaga omulimu.
But not everyone is.	Naye buli omu si bwe kiri.
It was a really hard time.	Ddala kyali kiseera kizibu nnyo.
Maybe it’s an idea.	Mpozzi nga kirowoozo.
That was what he expected.	Ekyo kye yali asuubira.
And he works hard.	Era akola nnyo.
But it’s not good.	Naye si kirungi.
Maybe all the time.	Mpozzi buli kiseera.
Although he doesn't seem to have a problem.	Wadde nga alabika talina buzibu.
Even the police were here.	Ne poliisi yali wano.
And I’m not the only one.	Era si nze nzekka.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
I'll come back to you.	Nja kudda gyoli.
Either we, or we.	Oba ffe, oba ffe.
We were going to make a movie.	Twali tugenda kukola firimu.
Not for someone in my position.	Si lwa muntu ali mu kifo kyange.
And you may not know.	Era oyinza okuba nga tomanyi.
We will be back soon.	Tujja kudda mu bbanga ttono.
I am one too.	Nze nange ndi omu.
I guess it was true.	Ntebereza nti kyali kituufu.
He was coming right up to me.	Yali ajja kumpi ddala gyendi.
I feel completely helpless.	Mpulira nga sirina kye nkola ddala.
I can’t go to jail.	Sisobola kugenda mu kkomera.
He was a man everyone wanted to know.	Yali musajja buli omu gwe yali ayagala okumanya.
Now there is no help for me.	Kati tewali buyambi bwonna gyendi.
So far, it’s pretty simple.	N’okutuusa kati, kyangu nnyo.
It is in here and it is this.	Kiri mu wano era kye kino.
And now he is .	Era kati ali .
We can’t help this.	Kino tetusobola kuyamba.
He didn't know if he should but he didn't know.	Yali tamanyi oba yandibadde akikola naye nga tamanyi.
He could do it now.	Yali asobola okukikola kati.
And no one has.	Era tewali alina.
It’s easy to do.	Kyangu okukola.
He is now with her.	Ye kati naye.
The house was very low.	Ennyumba yali wansi nnyo.
Everything was going to be fine.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda kubeera bulungi.
I wanted to be normal myself.	Nze kennyini nnali njagala kubeera wa bulijjo.
No one is doing anything.	Tewali akola kintu kyonna.
In any case .	Mu ngeri yonna .
But he has to study.	Naye alina okusoma.
That’s what it is.	Kye kiri.
We can and must do that.	Ekyo tusobola era tulina okukikola.
It’s all a class organization.	Byonna kibiina kya kibiina.
It’s not my place.	Si kifo kyange.
But he can’t come with us.	Naye tasobola kujja naffe.
You already know everything.	Buli kimu okimanyi dda.
He is such a good friend.	Ye mukwano omulungi bw’atyo.
I was so close.	Nnali kumpi nnyo.
So far, obviously.	N’okutuusa kati, kya lwatu.
He loved his friends.	Yali ayagala nnyo mikwano gye.
You can get help, but you have to do it.	Osobola okufuna obuyambi naye olina okukikola.
And he knew he wasn’t alone.	Era yali akimanyi nti si ye yekka.
But this is what it is.	Naye kino kye kiri.
He had always disliked school.	Bulijjo yali tayagala ssomero.
I’ve always known that was true.	Bulijjo nkimanyi nti ekyo kyali kituufu.
I can’t wait to try it.	Siyinza kulinda kugezaako.
There really is no such thing.	Mazima ddala tewali kintu ng’ekyo.
He can’t see anything.	Tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
I couldn’t do it.	Nnali siyinza kukikola.
Now it’s time to move on.	Kati kye kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
I'm on there.	Nze ndi ku awo.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
But of course no one can do that.	Naye ddala tewali asobola kukikola ekyo.
I wanted to do that.	Ekyo nnali njagala okukikola.
But that’s a bad thing.	Naye ekyo kibi.
I need to be alone.	Nze nneetaaga okubeera nzekka.
But not for very long.	Naye si bbanga ddene nnyo.
He already has my night.	Alina dda ekiro kyange.
That would be a blessing, that would be.	Ekyo kyandibadde mukisa, ekyo kyandibadde.
As it always is.	Nga bwe kiri bulijjo.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
But so far, that's basically been it.	Naye okutuusa kati, ekyo okusinga kye kyali.
This was my thing.	Kino kye kyali ekintu kyange.
They are in the house.	Bali mu nnyumba.
I love this movie.	Njagala nnyo firimu eno.
One on each side.	Omu ku buli ludda.
Anything would be better than this.	Ekintu kyonna kyandibadde kirungi okusinga kino.
And here it was.	Era wano we kyali.
I think that’s just, well, I hope you like it!.	Ndowooza ekyo kyokka, bulungi, nsuubira nti oyagala!.
You can never go home again.	Tosobola kuddamu kudda waka.
Good luck in everything.	Omukisa omulungi mu buli kimu.
Whatever is going on.	Kyonna ekigenda mu maaso.
I don’t want to see everything.	Saagala kulaba buli kimu.
This will be difficult.	Kino kijja kuba kizibu.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
I thought it was mine.	Nalowooza nti kyange.
But he was beautiful.	Naye yali alabika bulungi.
He is always very busy.	Bulijjo abeera bbize nnyo.
You know we’ll do it.	Omanyi tujja kukikola.
It was a good situation for me.	Yali mbeera nnungi gyendi.
It won’t be the same.	Tekijja kuba kye kimu.
For really anyone.	Ku lwa ddala omuntu yenna.
You were a great guy.	Ggwe wali ggaayi omulungi ennyo.
He doesn't have to be.	Talina kuba nti.
I think that’s what everyone should do.	Ndowooza ekyo buli muntu ky’alina okukola.
I couldn’t wait.	Nnali sisobola kulinda.
I can't speak.	Sisobola kwogera.
Money is neither everything nor the only thing.	Ssente si buli kimu wadde ekintu kyokka.
He felt speechless.	Yawulira nga tasobola kwogera.
There is something happening here all the time.	Wano waliwo ekigenda mu maaso buli kiseera.
Maybe a week.	Mpozzi wiiki emu.
He had something to say about it.	Yalina ky’ayagala okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
We don’t have time for that.	Ekyo tetulina budde.
We need a lot of money.	Twetaaga ssente nnyingi.
I hope it will be true .	Nsuubira nti kijja kuba kituufu .
I think he's in trouble.	Ndowooza ali mu buzibu.
I hope it doesn’t come to that.	Nsuubira nti tekijja ku ekyo.
It was his own problem.	Yali kizibu kye ye kennyini.
But he couldn’t.	Naye yali tasobola.
Not a huge amount of money.	Si ssente nnyingi nnyo.
I was sick of all this.	Bino byonna nnali mulwadde.
That is what matters to all of us.	Ekyo kye kikulu eri ffenna.
I’m doing the same thing.	Nze nkola ekintu kye kimu.
We are all friends.	Ffenna tuli ba mukwano.
He is his friend.	Ye mukwano gwe.
No, he has to go.	Nedda, alina okugenda.
But you can go now.	Naye osobola okugenda kati.
And for a lot of money.	Era ku ssente nnyingi nnyo.
He was in good shape.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi.
I thought everyone knew it.	Nalowooza nti buli omu akimanyi.
For me, though, it was very important.	Kyokka nze kyali kikulu nnyo.
I am a good man.	Nze ndi musajja mulungi.
It really would be.	Ddala kyandibadde.
He won’t help.	Tajja kuyamba.
And it’s not just mine.	Era si kyange kyokka.
But that’s just normal.	Naye ekyo kya bulijjo kyokka.
Maybe all of those things.	Mpozzi ebintu ebyo byonna.
There is no one.	Tewali muntu yenna.
Even when it was difficult.	Ne bwe kyali kizibu.
Everything he aspired to be.	Buli kintu kye yali ayagala ennyo okuba.
Not that we were really together, really.	Si nti twali wamu ddala, ddala.
I was a good person.	Nnali muntu mulungi.
You have one too .	Naawe olina emu .
Maybe even you.	Mpozzi ne ggwe.
Like a dog.	Nga embwa.
This is a truly daunting task.	Guno mulimu gwa maanyi nnyo mu butuufu.
Nothing easy about it.	Tewali kyangu ku nsonga eyo.
Maybe not immediately.	Mpozzi si mangu ddala.
No one goes behind him.	Tewali agenda emabega we.
I belong to both.	Nze ndi wa bombi.
The problem is very serious.	Ekizibu kikulu nnyo.
You’re at work.	Oli ku mulimu.
We have my phone.	Tulina essimu yange.
He said he would probably be here for a week.	Yagambye nti osanga ajja kuba wano okumala wiiki emu.
And yet he couldn’t.	Era naye nga tasobola.
I am very much a teacher.	Ndi musomesa nnyo.
That was his character.	Eyo ye yali engeri ye.
Certainly not today.	Mazima ddala si leero.
We can’t believe it.	Tetusobola kukkiriza.
I wonder if that is the idea?.	Nze nneebuuza oba ekyo kye kirowoozo?.
He says he doesn’t want any trouble.	Agamba nti tayagala buzibu bwonna.
But he wasn’t going to be her friend.	Naye yali tagenda kubeera mukwano gwe.
However, there is one problem.	Kyokka, waliwo ekizibu kimu.
Why he did this, he couldn't quite tell.	Lwaki yakola kino, yali tasobola bulungi kumanya.
You certainly can do it.	Mazima ddala osobola okukikola.
But one has hope .	Naye omuntu alina essuubi .
I'll talk to him.	Nja kwogera naye.
I think we were both basically into the same thing.	Ndowooza ffembi okusinga twali mu kintu kimu.
He started eating too much, talking too much.	Yatandika okulya ennyo, okwogera ennyo.
Like when he was young.	Nga bwe yali akyali muto.
That’s exactly what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri ddala.
Like right now.	Nga kati kati.
This is a terrible thing.	Kino kibi nnyo.
I was sick.	Nnali mulwadde.
Nothing to say about mine.	Tewali kya kwogera ku kyange.
Any plan will work.	Enteekateeka yonna ejja kukola.
And you are my wife now.	Era gwe mukyala wange kati.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
Thinking of my brother, mostly.	Okulowooza ku muganda wange, okusinga.
Something you couldn’t do either.	Ekintu ne ggwe kye wali tosobola kukola.
There I am.	Eyo nange.
Why did he do that.	Lwaki yakola ekyo.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
You can’t answer.	Tosobola kuddamu.
But this is not an ordinary time.	Naye kino si kiseera kya bulijjo.
No one knew where he was.	Tewali yali amanyi gye yali.
But if no one knew.	Naye singa tewali yali amanyi.
I wish I knew this better.	Njagala nnyo okumanya kino obulungi.
He says he has it in his car.	Agamba nti alina mu mmotoka ye.
I know you’re afraid.	Nkimanyi nti otya.
Everything was great.	Buli kimu kyali kirungi nnyo.
But it was just a local thing.	Naye kyali kintu kya wano kyokka.
I can’t say anything about that.	Ekyo siyinza kwogera kintu kyonna.
You have to do it day by day.	Olina okukikola olunaku ku lunaku.
Or almost anything.	Oba kumpi ekintu kyonna.
I won’t talk about it again.	Sijja kuddamu kwogera ku nsonga eno.
At the time I couldn’t do it.	Mu kiseera ekyo sisobola kukikola.
I know, it’s easy for me to say.	Nkimanyi, kyangu gyendi okwogera.
That’s all, it’s behind me.	Ekyo kyokka, kye kiri emabega wange.
You know it’s not true.	Omanyi si kituufu.
No, not at all.	Nedda, tewali n’akatono.
I was ready to get home.	Nnali mwetegefu okutuuka awaka.
However, there	Kyokka, eyo .
This is what he said.	Bino bye yayogera.
I thought it would be the same.	Nalowooza nti nange kijja kuba kye kimu.
Maybe he had more money than anyone knew.	Mpozzi yalina ssente nnyingi okusinga omuntu yenna bwe yali amanyi.
I have a job to do.	Nnina omulimu gwe nkola.
I couldn’t deal with it.	Nnali sisobola kukola ku nsonga.
That’s not really the case.	Ekyo mu butuufu si bwe kiri.
Back to my point.	Okudda ku nsonga yange.
No one was ready.	Tewali yali mwetegefu.
There is no processing.	Tewali kukola ku nsonga.
But it was all he could think to do.	Naye kye kyokka kye yali asobola okulowooza okukola.
I’m just a normal guy.	Nze ndi ggaayi wa bulijjo yekka.
In a sense.	Mu ngeri emu.
Everyone is in the group.	Buli omu ali mu kibiina.
Now you have to do that again.	Kati olina okuddamu okukola ekyo.
He was with me all night.	Yali nange ekiro kyonna.
He knows my son.	Amanyi mwana wange.
Dinner in town tonight .	Ekyeggulo mu kibuga ekiro kino .
He will be ready in time.	Ajja kuba mwetegefu mu budde.
But he needed to eat.	Naye yali yeetaaga okulya.
He is not me.	Ye si nze.
And he tries to be.	Era agezaako okubeera.
He came with us.	Yajja naffe.
I know now.	Mmanyi kati.
I just want to be here.	Njagala kubeera wano kyokka.
Here, however, it would be more difficult.	Kyokka wano kyandibadde kizibu nnyo.
And for me? 	Era ku nze?
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
She was having regular periods.	Yali agenda mu nsonga buli kiseera.
From this we have .	Okuva mu kino tulina .
In case you were curious.	Mu mbeera nga wali oyagala okumanya.
It will do better without.	Kijja kukola bulungi nga tewali.
But there is only so much we can do.	Naye waliwo bingi nnyo bye tusobola okukola.
From there it was easy.	Okuva awo kyali kyangu.
There is absolutely no reason to be afraid.	Tewali n’akatono nsonga lwaki otya.
You are mine now.	Ggwe wange kati.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
He knew what he needed to say.	Yali amanyi kye yali yeetaaga okwogera.
No one will know.	Tewali ajja kumanya.
You were my teacher.	Ggwe wali musomesa wange.
Maybe it’s time to move on again.	Mpozzi nga kye kiseera okuddamu okugenda mu maaso.
I knew a lot about that.	Ekyo nnali mmanyi bingi.
You are, you know.	Ggwe oli, omanyi.
Now, it only matters to him.	Kati, kikulu ku ye kyokka.
But other than that there was nothing.	Naye okuggyako ekyo nga tewali kintu kyonna.
I was expecting it.	Nali nsuubira.
She looked so beautiful.	Yalabika bulungi nnyo.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I can only imagine how difficult it is.	Nnyinza okulowooza nti kizibu nnyo.
I really didn’t have a father now.	Mazima ddala kati nnali sirina taata.
He just loves it so much.	Ayagala nnyo kyokka.
But he has.	Naye alina...
It’s happening now.	Kigenda mu maaso kati.
It is much worse than that.	Kibi nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He said he was sick.	Yagambye nti mulwadde.
And he .	Era ye .
And it’s real.	Era kya ddala.
And so do you.	Era naawe.
I just need to know.	Nze nneetaaga okumanya kyokka.
But that is the real problem.	Naye ekyo kye kizibu ennyo.
That was a powerful moment.	Ekyo kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo.
He had been the best.	Yali abadde asinga obulungi.
I am sure I will.	Nkakasa nti nja kukola.
She was glad he was.	Yali musanyufu nti yali bw’atyo.
Like, really good.	Nga, ddala kirungi.
That would be so easy for me to do.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo gyendi okukola.
He will, he will do it.	Ajja, ajja kukikola.
Good or not.	Kirungi oba nedda.
You, here with me.	Ggwe, wano nange.
Anything but, actually.	Ekintu kyonna naye, mu butuufu.
It will be about 100.	Kijja kuba nga 100.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
But time is on his side.	Naye obudde buli ku ludda lwe.
To me, it’s not the point.	Eri nze, si ye nsonga.
He did very well.	Yakola bulungi nnyo.
Why speak up? 	Lwaki okwogera?
I'm not sure what's going on.	Sikakasa kiki ekigenda mu maaso.
That’s not a good reason.	Eyo si nsonga nnungi.
I hope that it is.	Nsuubira nti bwe kiri.
Really nothing.	Ddala tewali kintu kyonna.
Back to me.	Okudda gyendi.
We really have to get to the truth.	Ddala tulina okutuuka ku mazima.
That is not easy to do.	Ekyo si kyangu kukikola.
It was his father.	Yali taata we.
Like he wasn’t ready to go.	Nga bwe yali si mwetegefu kugenda.
He was living alone.	Yali abeera yekka yekka.
I am so glad you are.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nti gwe.
However, that it was important to do so.	Kyokka nti kyali kikulu okukikola.
Money is not the thing.	Ssente si kye kintu.
You can do it, you can do it.	Osobola okukikola, osobola okukikola.
He wasn’t really mine.	Mu butuufu yali si wange.
We needed this.	Kino twali twetaaga.
Now it’s really really.	Kati ddala ddala.
Everyone is afraid of what will happen tonight.	Buli omu atya ekigenda okubaawo ekiro kino.
There is no reason.	Tewali nsonga yonna.
I had no idea, why.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna, lwaki.
I love my job.	Njagala nnyo omulimu gwange.
I think she looks great.	Ndowooza alabika bulungi nnyo.
There is no problem at all.	Tewali buzibu bwonna.
I didn’t know either of them.	Nze ku bombi nnali simanyi.
Nothing is the same.	Tewali kintu kye kimu.
He must be a little sleepy.	Ateekwa okuba nga yeebase katono.
I was always working.	Bulijjo nnali nkola.
It was him or nothing.	Yali ye oba nga tewali.
And it’s there in all of us.	Era kiri awo mu ffe ffenna.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
Excellent beauty.	Obulungi ennyo.
That’s where the problem lies.	Awo we wali ekizibu.
I can’t do it.	Sisobola kukikola.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
Everyone is, except me.	Buli muntu ali, okuggyako nze.
Today is my turn.	Leero kye kiseera kyange.
Is that a bad thing?.	Ekyo kintu kibi?.
I’m not even a human being.	Nze siri wadde omuntu.
Not too much though.	Si bingi nnyo wadde.
He tried to do it.	Yagezaako okukikola.
Only the one who tries.	Oyo yekka agezaako.
That is my priority.	Ekyo kye kikulu kyange.
He has a lot of money.	Alina ssente nnyingi.
You have to do well.	Olina okukola obulungi.
We were very close friends.	Twali ba mukwano nnyo.
From which side, he doesn't know.	Okuva ku ludda ki, tamanyi.
In fact, it’s happening and it’s great.	Mu butuufu, kigenda mu maaso era nga kirungi nnyo.
I need some alone time.	Nze nneetaaga akaseera nga ndi nzekka.
I’ll be here in the morning.	Nja kuba wano ku makya.
He wanted to quit his job.	Yali ayagala okuva ku mulimu.
It’s not true at all.	Si kituufu n’akatono.
I knew exactly what to expect.	Nnali mmanyi bulungi kye nnali nsuubira.
I didn’t know the day or the time.	Nnali simanyi lunaku oba budde.
It would be detrimental to both.	Kyandibadde kya bulabe eri bombi.
I have been very lucky.	Mbadde wa mukisa nnyo.
It’s a little difficult.	Kizibu katono.
Not now, under any circumstances.	Si kati, mu mbeera yonna.
This is really powerful.	Eno ddala ya maanyi.
I love this product.	Njagala nnyo ekintu kino.
This was not the only problem.	Kino si kye kyali ekizibu kyokka.
I’ll be home soon.	Nja kudda waka mu bbanga ttono.
Money is nothing.	Ssente si kintu kyonna.
I, too, am a busy man.	Nze, nange, ndi musajja wa bbize.
It was very .	Yali nnyo .
He should have said that.	Yandibadde ayogera bw’atyo.
We'll talk tomorrow.	Tujja kwogera enkya.
Then he said.	Awo n’agamba nti.
He says it isn’t.	Agamba nti si bwe kiri.
I hope that goes well.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kigenda bulungi.
But right now, he had no choice.	Naye mu kiseera kino, yali talina kya kukola.
You really have to do it.	Ddala olina okukikola.
There is no option for this at the moment.	Tewali nkola ya kino mu kiseera kino.
I don’t want this.	Kino saagala.
I will certainly do it.	Mazima ddala nja kukikola.
That’s fine, and right, no problem.	Ekyo kirungi, era kituufu, tewali buzibu.
It’s important when working with money.	Kikulu nga okola ne ssente.
He seems to be a strong man.	Alabika musajja wa maanyi.
That will be me.	Ekyo kijja kuba nze.
No one could believe this was really happening.	Tewali yali asobola kukkiriza nti kino ddala kyali kigenda mu maaso.
You can go now.	Osobola okugenda kati.
I know that very well.	Ekyo nkimanyi nnyo.
Perhaps it was.	Oboolyawo bwe kyali.
Probably not now.	Oboolyawo si kati.
It’s his thing now.	Kintu kye kati.
Maybe it’s real.	Mpozzi nga kya ddala.
This is a very serious problem.	Kino kizibu kya maanyi nnyo.
I didn’t know, of course.	Nze nnali simanyi, ddala.
This problem goes away quickly.	Ekizibu kino kigenda mu bwangu.
I have this thing.	Nnina ekintu kino.
But the problem is the same.	Naye ekizibu kye kimu.
But this is not really true.	Naye kino mu butuufu si kituufu.
That, obviously, was very difficult.	Ekyo, kya lwatu, kyali kizibu nnyo.
He is very happy.	Ye musanyufu nnyo.
This is not my opinion.	Eno si ndowooza yange.
The movie started.	Firimu yatandika.
He says it is very important to talk to you.	Agamba nti kikulu nnyo okwogera naawe.
I’m not like you.	Nze siri nga ggwe.
I’ll see what we have here.	Nja kulaba kye tulina wano.
But now it doesn’t matter.	Naye kati si kikulu.
He knows he is here.	Akimanyi nti ali wano.
We probably need to talk face to face.	Oboolyawo twetaaga okwogera maaso ku maaso.
It’s great to be home.	Kirungi nnyo okubeera awaka.
That’s what he did.	Bw’atyo bwe yakola.
Not for much.	Si lwa bingi.
I can do that at school and in the city.	Ekyo nsobola okukikola ku ssomero ne mu kibuga.
He was certainly done.	Mazima yali amaze.
Or he needs to know that it is.	Oba yeetaaga okumanya nti bwe kiri.
In this case you.	Mu mbeera eno ggwe.
But this is not dangerous.	Naye kino si kya bulabe.
I wanted something about him.	Nnali njagala ekintu ku ye.
He is not dangerous.	Si wa bulabe.
No one in the office will ever know.	Tewali muntu yenna mu ofiisi ajja kumanya.
Like you, now.	Nga ggwe, kati.
I love both of them.	Njagala nnyo bombi.
He should have known.	Yandibadde amanyi.
It’s very dangerous for you.	Kya bulabe nnyo gy’oli.
He knows everything.	Amanyi buli kimu.
But there they were, every day.	Naye awo we baali, buli lunaku.
It’s hard for me to find the time.	Kizibu gyendi okufuna obudde.
No one could do without it.	Tewali yali asobola kukola nga tewali ekyo.
He was very, very scared.	Yali atya nnyo nnyo.
That’s in his best interest.	Ekyo kiri mu bulungi bwe.
I know where you are.	Nze mmanyi gyoli.
He can’t win.	Tasobola kuwangula.
And it’s not true.	Era si kituufu.
I thought that was a powerful thing to say.	Nnalowooza nti ekyo kyali kintu kya maanyi nnyo okwogera.
This is a very powerful thing.	Kino kintu kya maanyi nnyo.
It was for that.	Kyali lwa ekyo.
I wasn’t going to talk.	Nnali sigenda kwogera.
This seems to be a complex problem.	Kino kirabika kizibu ekizibu ennyo.
He was not a good man.	Yali si musajja mulungi.
This will be enough.	Kino kijja kumala.
We are all one group.	Ffenna tuli kibiina kimu.
That is what it is for us.	Ekyo kye kiri gye tuli.
I hope anyone else does the same.	Nsuubira omuntu omulala yenna okukola kye kimu.
No one was anyone’s friend.	Tewali yali mukwano gwa muntu yenna.
He did everything he had to do.	Yakola buli kye yali alina okukola.
He wanted to do this.	Kino yali ayagala okukikola.
How easy it was.	Nga kyali kyangu nnyo.
It’s not easy.	Si kyangu.
Nothing you want to see.	Tewali ky’oyagala kulaba.
He tried, but couldn't speak.	Yagezaako, naye nga tasobola kwogera.
I would love to read about it!.	Njagala nnyo okusoma ku nsonga eyo!.
My brother is also very good.	Muganda wange naye mulungi nnyo.
He thinks about everything.	Alowooza ku buli kimu.
I’ll do whatever you want.	Nja kukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
There is no money.	Tewali ssente.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
You don’t have to do it either.	Naawe tolina kukikola.
So did he.	Bwatyo ne ye.
And that was nowhere without anyone.	Era ekyo tewali we kyali nga tewali muntu yenna.
It’s really mine.	Ddala kyange.
I love to eat.	Njagala nnyo okulya.
That you can eat.	Nti osobola okulya.
It’s okay.	Kiri bulungi.
And it’s not true.	Era si kituufu.
There is a plan.	Waliwo enteekateeka.
He is ready to go.	Ye mwetegefu okugenda.
That will be good.	Ekyo kijja kuba kirungi.
But they really are.	Naye ddala bwe bali.
He was like a father to both of us.	Yali nga taata gye tuli ffembi.
This arrangement worked very well.	Enteekateeka eno yakola bulungi nnyo.
In my own city.	Mu kibuga kyange.
I know nothing about him.	Sirina kye mmanyi ku ye.
In that sense, it is normal.	Mu ngeri eyo, kya bulijjo.
How can I do this.	Kino nnyinza ntya okukikola.
I want to know how it is.	Njagala okumanya engeri gye kiri.
The food is good.	Emmere nnungi.
This is now easy to obtain.	Kino kati kyangu okufuna.
He was so good to be around.	Yali mulungi nnyo okubeera naye.
We will be there.	Tujja kubeerawo.
He did it.	Yakikola.
No one was sleeping soundly.	Tewali yali yeebase bulungi.
My son is so beautiful.	Mwana wange mulungi nnyo.
Very good, he thought.	Kirungi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
I am terrified for my son.	Ntya nnyo ku lwa mwana wange.
They were in excellent condition.	Baali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
And he’s not good.	Era si mulungi.
It is a beautiful place.	Kifo kirungi nnyo.
I’m so close.	Nze ndi kumpi nnyo.
But he was trying.	Naye yali agezaako.
I am the only one.	Nze ndi nzekka.
This is a complex problem.	Kino kizibu kya buzibu.
He wanted to hit someone.	Yali ayagala okukuba omuntu.
He was not ordinary.	Yali si wa bulijjo.
She was so unbelievably happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo nga tayinza kukkiriza.
This is really awful.	Kino ddala kibi nnyo.
None of his reasoning.	Tewali nsonga yonna ku nsonga ze.
That wasn’t the case for me.	Ekyo si bwe kyali gyendi.
My brother has his own job.	Muganda wange alina omulimu gwe.
He is doing very well.	Akola bulungi nnyo.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
From any situation.	Okuva mu mbeera yonna.
He is a man of knowledge.	Ye musajja amanyi.
He doesn't know exactly what it is.	Tamanyi bulungi kiki kye kiri.
And he is happy.	Era musanyufu.
You know, he's fine.	Omanyi, ali bulungi.
Both are true.	Bombi ba mazima.
And this is really important.	Era kino ddala kikulu.
He agreed to do it.	Yakkiriza okukikola.
Probably everyone mostly.	Oboolyawo buli muntu okusinga.
We have to do it again soon.	Tulina okuddamu okukikola mu bbanga ttono.
Knowing this is very important.	Okumanya kino kikulu nnyo.
He says he won’t go.	Agamba nti tajja kugenda.
You are mine and always will be mine.	Oli wange era bulijjo ojja kuba wange.
It’s not a policy.	Si nkola.
This is what it is.	Kino kye kiri.
He doesn’t have a house.	Talina nnyumba.
I can do that at home.	Ekyo nsobola okukikola awaka.
You do though.	Ggwe okola wadde.
He did hunger.	Yakola enjala.
But there is no problem.	Naye tewali buzibu bwonna.
Probably not for long.	Oboolyawo si lwa bbanga ddene.
Not like he did.	Si nga bwe yakola.
I always wanted to work in film.	Bulijjo nnali njagala okukola mu firimu.
He couldn’t believe it.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza.
I didn’t really want to do it.	Nnali saagala nnyo kukikola.
Help on how to do this.	Obuyambi ku ngeri y’okukola kino.
There is nothing down there.	Tewali kintu kyonna wansi awo.
Whoever he was.	Oyo yenna gwe yali.
He was just that.	Yali ekyo kyokka kye yali.
It was really difficult.	Ddala kyali kizibu.
I love it here.	Njagala nnyo wano.
I think it’s difficult now.	Ndowooza kati kizibu.
Not much, but a little.	Si bingi, naye katono.
There is no urgency for anything to happen.	Tewali bwangu bwa kintu kyonna kubaawo.
He was just alone.	Yali yekka yekka.
Anyone will do.	Omuntu yenna ajja kukola.
It was a very dangerous process.	Yali nkola ya bulabe nnyo.
But not in that way.	Naye si mu ngeri eyo.
Everyone was working hard.	Buli omu yali akola nnyo.
I’ve always been able to do it.	Bulijjo mbadde nsobola okukikola.
It was a difficult thing.	Kyali kizibu.
But you will know .	Naye ojja kumanya .
my friend.	mukwano gwange.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
This is a dangerous time.	Kino kiseera kya bulabe.
She couldn’t wait to see the baby.	Yali tasobola kulinda kulaba mwana.
A little bit of it.	Katono ddala.
He was talking to us.	Yali ayogera naffe.
I was there too.	Nange nnali awo.
It would be a real blessing.	Kyandibadde mukisa gwa ddala.
I was almost behind him.	Nali kumpi emabega we.
I have this problem.	Nnina ekizibu kino.
Not us now.	Si ffe kati.
This was almost normal.	Kino kyali kumpi kya bulijjo.
Someone is always working on you.	Bulijjo waliwo akola ku ggwe.
You could maybe but it’s not real.	Oyinza mpozzi naye si kya ddala.
He is there now.	Ali awo kati.
That was my point.	Eyo gye yali ensonga yange.
He would like that.	Ekyo yandiyagadde.
This is a very good thing.	Kino kirungi nnyo.
I thought he was my friend.	Nalowooza nti ye mukwano gwange.
However, this is not entirely true.	Kyokka kino si kituufu ddala.
This is the job of the police.	Guno mulimu gwa poliisi.
He could hit very well.	Yali asobola okukuba obulungi ennyo.
That will be easy.	Ekyo kijja kuba kyangu.
I’m a father.	Nze ndi taata.
He is really very good.	Ddala mulungi nnyo.
And that’s not a bad thing though.	Era ekyo si kintu kibi wadde.
And he said.	N’agamba nti.
It’s a difficult thing to do.	Kintu kizibu okukola.
He wanted to be an artist.	Yali ayagala kubeera muyimbi.
He hadn't said anything at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo yali tannaba kwogera kintu kyonna.
We can’t wait.	Tetusobola kulinda.
That’s the way it is.	Ekyo bwe kiri.
I knew it could only be one thing.	Namanya nti kiyinza okuba ekintu kimu kyokka.
Indeed, let	Mazima ddala, ka .
He could talk about anything.	Yali asobola okwogera ku kintu kyonna.
Visually, it looks good.	Mu kulaba, kirabika bulungi.
I’m not going to do anything.	Sigenda kukola kintu kyonna.
Being here you will.	Okubeera wano ojja...
And back, and together.	Era okudda emabega, era nga bali wamu.
It’s not a matter of whether.	Si nsonga ya oba.
It’s not pretty but it’s true.	Si kirungi naye kituufu.
I don’t want anything whatsoever.	Saagala kintu kyonna kyonna.
But that’s not all that’s going on.	Naye ekyo si kye kyokka ekigenda mu maaso.
I am sure that .	Nkakasa nti .
Money is a problem.	Ssente kizibu.
But no, it’s not him.	Naye nedda, si ye.
Now, he was here.	Kati, yali wano.
Not here, not in the room.	Si wano, si mu kisenge.
She loved her dogs.	Yali ayagala nnyo embwa ze.
Everything is going to be fine.	Buli kimu kigenda kuba bulungi.
Even then .	Ne mu kiseera ekyo .
They were ancient.	Baali ba dda.
He didn’t want to be alone.	Yali tayagala kubeera yekka.
I think we can do this.	Ndowooza kino tusobola okukikola.
I will deal with everything.	Nja kukola ku buli kimu.
They were completely normal.	Baali ba bulijjo ddala.
No one is coming.	Tewali ajja.
He had something he needed.	Yalina kye yeetaaga.
You don’t have to do it.	Tolina kukikola.
It will happen again.	Kijja kuddamu okubaawo.
She needed a home.	Yali yeetaaga awaka.
Good for you.	Kirungi ku ggwe.
But it is	Naye nga .
Working as it is.	Okukola nga bwe kiri nti.
Nobody has that.	Ekyo tewali muntu yenna ky’alina.
Actually, it was quite difficult.	Mu butuufu, kyali kizibu nnyo.
I and what.	Nze era kiki.
Things he wanted to do.	Ebintu bye yali ayagala okukola.
This is not good, he thought.	Kino si kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
This is exactly the same problem.	Kino kye kizibu kye kimu ddala.
I really, really loved it.	Nze ddala, ddala nnali njagala nnyo.
Almost immediately, though.	Kumpi amangu ddala, naye.
And that was all it was.	Era ekyo kyokka kye kyali.
He would have known immediately what it was.	Yandibadde amanyi mangu kye kyali.
You will love the product.	Ojja kwagala nnyo ekintu ekyo.
And of course, he did a pretty good job.	Era ddala, yakola omulimu mulungi nnyo.
I hope you are well!.	Nsuubira nti oli bulungi!.
But, of course, it is.	Naye, ddala, bwe kiri.
You can do it in many ways.	Osobola okukikola mu ngeri nnyingi.
He can’t win, you know.	Tasobola kuwangula, omanyi.
I’m too sick to do it.	Nze mulwadde nnyo okukikola.
And honestly, what he needed to do.	Era mu butuufu, kye yali yeetaaga okukola.
I’m glad you’re interested.	Ndi musanyufu nti oyagala.
But that picture is too simple.	Naye ekifaananyi ekyo kyangu nnyo.
In this case it is.	Mu mbeera eno bwe kiri.
It was a lot of money.	Yali ssente nnyingi nnyo.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
He was talking about coming here.	Yali ayogera ku kujja wano.
He was the best.	Ye yali asinga obulungi.
I am also very well.	Nze era ndi bulungi nnyo.
But it wasn’t like that at all.	Naye si bwe kyali n’akatono.
This is actually the case.	Kino mu butuufu bwe kiri.
Clearly, it is a difficult time.	Kya lwatu nti kiseera kizibu.
You have it or you don’t.	Olina oba nedda.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
He used to be such a gay man.	Yali abeera muganzi bw’atyo.
I’m feeling pretty good.	Nze mpulira bulungi nnyo.
This may well happen.	Kino kiyinza bulungi okubaawo.
I’ve always been very busy.	Bulijjo mbadde bbize nnyo.
He will do anything.	Ajja kukola kyonna.
This was going to be bad.	Kino kyali kigenda kuba kibi.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
There is nothing there.	Tewali kintu kyonna awo.
In practice, this is not true.	Mu nkola, kino si kituufu.
It doesn’t really matter.	Mu butuufu si nsonga.
He should have gone.	Yandibadde agenda.
That’s what he really felt.	Ekyo kye yawulira ddala.
But this was not where he wanted to be.	Naye wano si we yali ayagala okubeera.
I couldn’t wait.	Nnali sisobola kulinda.
That, and he had been sick as a dog.	Ekyo, era yali abadde mulwadde nga embwa.
He knew he would never be the same.	Yali akimanyi nti tajja kubeera nga bwe yali.
You think about something.	Olowooza ku kintu.
He does that a lot.	Ekyo akikola nnyo.
He was very strong.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo.
He was nobody.	Yali si muntu yenna.
I want to be comfortable.	Njagala kubeera bulungi.
I love doing it.	Njagala nnyo okukikola.
But he is too young.	Naye ye muto nnyo.
He certainly knew a bit more now.	Mazima ddala yali amanyi katono kati.
It’s easy, but it’s so hard to do.	Kyangu, naye nga kizibu nnyo okukikola.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si kyokka.
There is another one.	Waliwo omulala.
It’s really a job.	Ddala mulimu.
And it is, it is.	Era bwe kiri, bwe kiri.
It was his watch.	Yali ssaawa ye.
Anything could happen here, she felt.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okubaawo wano, bwe yawulira.
This is probably good.	Kino osanga kirungi.
No one was too good, too happy.	Tewali yali mulungi nnyo, musanyufu nnyo.
But he is very good.	Naye mulungi nnyo.
This is not a problem.	Kino si kizibu.
His food was there.	Emmere ye yali awo.
There is definitely something to this.	Mazima ddala waliwo ekintu ku kino.
I know it’s not good for me.	Nkimanyi nti si kirungi gyendi.
There is no way for me.	Tewali ngeri gyendi.
Apparently .	Kirabika .
You should have come with me.	Wandibadde ojja nange.
No, it’s a really bad idea.	Nedda, ddala kirowoozo kibi.
And yes, there was a moment.	Era ye, waliwo akaseera.
This could just be me though.	Kino kiyinza okuba nze kyokka wadde.
Very nice, very easy to talk to.	Kirungi nnyo, kyangu nnyo okwogera naye.
He came to me.	Yajja gyendi.
There is no reason for him to be unhappy.	Tewali nsonga lwaki si musanyufu.
He is everything to me.	Ye buli kimu gyendi.
But she is my wife.	Naye ye mukyala wange.
It had to go on.	Kyalina okugenda mu maaso.
And it’s very difficult.	Era kizibu nnyo.
But you don’t have to do that.	Naye ekyo tolina kukikola.
The book is in good condition.	Ekitabo kiri mu mbeera nnungi.
I'll go in the morning.	Nja kugenda ku makya.
Apparently he’s not the only one.	Kirabika si ye yekka.
We will be able to do anything.	Tujja kuba tusobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
We can do this all over again.	Kino kyonna tusobola okuddamu okukikola.
He can’t help his thoughts.	Tasobola kuyamba ndowooza ze.
He said he knew.	Yagambye nti amanyi.
I'm just wondering.	Nze nneebuuza kyokka.
I am just a human being.	Nze ndi muntu yekka.
Which is not the case.	Kye si bwe kiri.
I just didn’t know what to do.	Nze nnali simanyi kya kukola.
It is indeed very difficult.	Mazima ddala kizibu nnyo.
For a while we were.	Okumala akaseera twali...
This is exactly what he wanted.	Kino ddala kye yali ayagala.
He said it was something.	Yagambye nti kyali kintu.
He just had to do it.	Yalina okukikola kyokka.
But it won’t happen.	Naye tekijja kubaawo.
He is a very nice man, actually.	Musajja mulungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
He's going to be fine.	Agenda kuba bulungi.
He was as friendly as ever.	Yali wa mukwano nnyo nga bulijjo.
This will not be the same.	Kino tekijja kuba kye kimu.
He had no idea what it was.	Yali talina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki.
He started to back away a little.	Yatandika okudda emabega katono.
No problem.	Tewali buzibu.
He really wants to do well.	Ddala ayagala okukola obulungi.
For me, this is powerful.	Nze kino kya maanyi.
However, he is not.	Kyokka si bw’atyo.
You know where you are, of course.	Omanyi gy’oli, ddala.
He would be very lucky.	Yandibadde wa mukisa nnyo.
So he was at work.	Bwatyo yali ku mulimu.
You will not be able to do this alone.	Ggwe wekka kino tojja kusobola kukikola.
It is his reason.	Ye nsonga ye.
He was very interested.	Yali ayagala nnyo.
I am so lucky to be in this position.	Ndi wa mukisa nnyo okubeera mu kifo kino.
We don’t have anything.	Tetulina kye tulina.
He wanted to go home more than anything.	Yali ayagala kudda waka okusinga ekintu kyonna.
Mostly difficulty.	Okusinga obuzibu.
I would love to work again.	Njagala nnyo okuddamu okukola.
I was ready for this.	Kino nnali mwetegefu.
There is no time to do anything.	Tewali budde bwa kukola kintu kyonna.
I love it so much	Njagala nnyo .
I think the whole thing looks great.	Ndowooza ekintu kyonna kirabika bulungi nnyo.
And, we have now.	Era, tulina kati.
But it won’t be home.	Naye tekijja kuba waka.
We are strong.	Tuli ba maanyi.
That fact is in his best interest.	Ensonga eyo eri mu bulungi bwe.
Apparently he knows.	Kirabika amanyi.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
Not at all, of course.	N’akatono, ddala.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
He got that much.	Yafuna bingi ebyo.
There is no harm.	Tewali bulabe bwonna.
No one says it is.	Tewali agamba nti bwe kiri.
This way, quickly.	Mu ngeri eno, mu bwangu.
I’m not going anywhere but here.	Nze sirina gye ngenda okuggyako wano.
But all this is nothing.	Naye bino byonna si kintu.
He's coming here.	Ajja wano.
This is going to be difficult.	Kino kigenda kuba kizibu.
It was a very good point.	Yali nsonga nnungi nnyo.
I am just one person.	Nze ndi muntu omu yekka.
Obviously, we can’t.	Kya lwatu nti tetusobola.
You’re not here.	Ggwe toli wano.
He hoped he did.	Yalina essuubi nti yakikola.
With a picture.	Nga alina ekifaananyi.
From his friends.	Okuva mu mikwano gye.
I’m an artist, just like you.	Nze ndi muyimbi, nga ggwe.
To him, it’s not a problem at all.	Eri ye, si kizibu n’akatono.
And it won’t work.	Era tekijja kukola.
That’s not realistic in that city.	Ekyo si kya ddala mu kibuga ekyo.
He didn't know where.	Yali tamanyi wa.
He hoped he was.	Yalina essuubi nti bwe yali.
Obviously, they are not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe bali.
I wasn’t quite sure.	Nnali sikakasa bulungi.
There is so much more.	Waliwo bingi nnyo.
And in a way, it is.	Era mu ngeri emu, bwe kiri.
That’s not power.	Ekyo si maanyi.
Of course, no one person can.	Kya lwatu nti tewali muntu omu asobola.
Not in the city.	Si mu kibuga.
He spoke very, very loudly.	Yayogera nnyo nnyo.
All very much always.	Byonna nnyo bulijjo.
I wanted to spend time on my imagination.	Nnali njagala okumala obudde ku ndowooza yange.
The guy seemed okay.	Ggaayi yalabika nga talina buzibu.
He had to get to class.	Yalina okutuuka mu kibiina.
I can talk to him.	Nsobola okwogera naye.
There is nothing to do.	Tewali kya kukola.
I feel really good.	Mpulira nga ndi bulungi ddala.
It’s very powerful,’ he said.	Kya maanyi nnyo,’ bwe yagambye.
He here for a very long time.	Ye wano ebbanga ddene nnyo.
He couldn’t very well go to work with her.	Yali tasobola bulungi nnyo kugenda kukola naye.
But in a situation like this, it’s not that hard.	Naye mu mbeera nga eno, si kizibu nnyo.
That’s it, what I need.	Kye ekyo, kye nneetaaga.
Or anyone in the room.	Oba omuntu yenna ali mu kisenge.
As if that will help.	Nga bwe kiri nti ekyo kijja kuyamba.
He came to see.	Yajja okulaba.
That’s not the same thing.	Ekyo si kye kimu.
He couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola.
Not exactly romantic.	Si ddala kya mukwano.
His picture really comes across well.	Ekifaananyi kye ddala kijja bulungi.
There they are there.	Eyo gye bali eyo.
It’s time to deliver.	Kye kiseera okutuusa.
No, he knew better than that.	Nedda, yali amanyi okusinga ekyo.
I think he felt better.	Ndowooza yawulira bulungi.
No, there they were.	Nedda, awo we baali.
This was a very difficult one.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo.
It might actually be good.	Mu butuufu kiyinza okuba nga kirungi.
You know you can.	Omanyi nti osobola.
Apparently this is a very common practice.	Kirabika eno nkola ya bulijjo nnyo.
He's not too happy about this, obviously.	Kino si musanyufu nnyo, kya lwatu.
We can eat well.	Tusobola okulya obulungi.
Maybe, but maybe not.	Mpozzi, naye mpozzi nedda.
He was asleep alone.	Yali yeebase yekka.
He tried to speak.	Yagezaako okwogera.
He expected so much.	Yali asuubira bingi nnyo.
That was the idea.	Eyo ye yali ndowooza.
He had to go home.	Yalina okudda eka.
And now, it would be nice to get to work.	Era kati, kyandibadde kirungi okutuuka ku mulimu.
He may fit very well.	Ayinza okutuuka obulungi ennyo.
That’s good, very good.	Ekyo kirungi, kirungi nnyo.
I was in trouble.	Nnali nfunye ekizibu.
Everyone looked dangerous.	Buli omu yalabika nga wa bulabe.
However, this is true since we were.	Kyokka kino kituufu okuva lwe twali.
Maybe this will happen or that will happen.	Mpozzi kino kijja kubaawo oba ekyo kijja kubaawo.
I don’t really want anything.	Sirina kye njagala ddala.
You are like me.	Ggwe oli nga nze.
He already knew.	Yali amanyi dda.
It was actually my idea.	Mu butuufu kyali kirowoozo kyange.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
It was very real for me.	Kyali kya ddala nnyo gyendi.
It’s in him.	Kiri mu ye.
He had no eyes.	Yali talina maaso.
You certainly have.	Mazima ddala olina.
Everyone loves to be with him.	Buli muntu ayagala nnyo okubeera naye.
he thought to himself.	bwe yalowooza.
He doesn’t have to do this.	Kino talina kukikola.
He really really had.	Ddala ddala yalina.
That’s what we need.	Kye twetaaga.
That is very powerful.	Ekyo kya maanyi nnyo.
We will be needing all the help we can get, baby.	Tujja kuba twetaaga obuyambi bwonna bwe tusobola okufuna mwana wange.
He didn’t want any trouble.	Yali tayagala buzibu bwonna.
As he always did.	Nga bwe yakola bulijjo.
Or reading or something.	Oba okusoma oba ekintu kyonna.
He’s not here yet.	Tannaba wano.
That would be him.	Ekyo kyandibadde ye.
Maybe too many things.	Mpozzi ebintu bingi nnyo.
If he could do that, he could do anything.	Singa yali asobola okukola ekyo, yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
I don’t know how bad it is.	Simanyi ngeri kibi gye kiri.
It’s so hard to have him here now.	Kizibu nnyo okubeera naye wano kati.
It’s not just who we are.	Si kye tuli kyokka.
He was going home.	Yali agenda okudda eka.
He always could.	Bulijjo yali asobola.
There is no time limit.	Tewali kiseera kyonna.
I don’t quite know how to .	Nze simanyi bulungi ngeri ya .
He is always here.	Bulijjo abeera wano.
I couldn’t see.	Nnali sisobola kulaba.
I go, a very long time.	Ngenda, ebbanga ddene nnyo.
It’s really difficult.	Ddala kizibu.
You’re going to talk to him.	Ggwe ogenda okwogera naye.
I really wanted to go.	Nnali njagala nnyo okugenda.
It’s not realistic.	Si kya ddala.
It is indeed the case.	Ddala bwe kiri.
You can see his point of view.	Osobola okulaba endowooza ye.
So far, it’s very difficult.	N’okutuusa kati, kizibu nnyo.
In each other.	Mu buli omu.
We are at home.	Tuli waka.
That’s what we are now.	Ekyo kye tuli kati.
We can talk about ideas.	Tusobola okwogera ku ndowooza.
Like they were actually anything but.	Nga mu butuufu baali kintu kyonna naye.
Not no, no.	Si nedda, nedda.
This will be coming to me soon.	Kino kijja kuba kijja gyendi mu bbanga ttono.
It’s as simple as it sounds.	Kyangu nga bwe kirabika.
He said he would get back to me.	Yagamba nti ajja kudda gye ndi.
And, in a way .	Era, mu ngeri .
He is all we need.	Ye kyokka kye twetaaga.
She was his girlfriend.	Yali muganzi we.
There really isn’t any reason.	Mu butuufu tewali nsonga yonna.
We’ll just get on without it.	Tujja kumala kugenda mu maaso nga tetulina.
He can’t, of course.	Tasobola, ddala.
He said it would be nice.	Yagambye nti kyandibadde kirungi.
The bottom will be fine.	Wansi ajja kuba bulungi.
But what he did.	Naye kye yakola.
Of course, at this point, nothing is going to happen.	Kya lwatu mu kiseera kino, tewali kigenda kubaawo.
Anything will work.	Ekintu kyonna kijja kukola.
No, no, no, not that.	Nedda nedda nedda, si ekyo.
This is nowhere to be found.	Kino tewali kifo kyonna.
That’s what we’re all here for.	Ekyo ffenna kye tuli wano.
He couldn't see, well.	Yali tasobola kulaba, bulungi.
This was definitely happening.	Kino kyali kigenda mu maaso ddala.
He would be alone in his situation.	Yandibadde yekka mu mbeera ye.
No, he admitted.	Nedda, bwe yakkiriza.
He could come from anything.	Yali asobola okuva mu kintu kyonna.
You’ll be fine.	Ojja kuba bulungi.
We are nowhere to be found.	Tetulina we tuli.
I hope there is.	Nsuubira nti waliwo.
It was a powerful feeling.	Yali mpulira ya maanyi nnyo.
That's the whole idea.	Ekyo kye kirowoozo kyonna.
He is happy and playful.	Musanyufu era muzannyi wa kuzannya.
In point, of course.	Mu nsonga, ddala.
He may be nothing.	Ayinza okuba nga tewali kintu kyonna.
I was thinking the same thing.	Nze nali ndowooza ekintu kye kimu.
I like making things myself.	Nze kennyini njagala nnyo okukola ebintu.
We were safe.	Twali tetulina bulabe.
That will be something.	Ekyo kijja kuba kintu.
It is close to us.	Kiri kumpi naffe.
Maybe that was all.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kyali kyokka.
There is nothing to say.	Tewali kya kwogera.
That’s certainly what we can do.	Ekyo mazima ddala kye tusobola.
There is no hurry and no time.	Tewali bwangu era tewali budde.
It is not that .	Si bwe kiri nti .
Apparently no one is home.	Kirabika tewali muntu yenna waka.
It would probably be a problem.	Oboolyawo kyandibadde kizibu.
But he is not a singer.	Naye si muyimbi.
It's just down the hall.	Kiri wansi mu kisenge kyokka.
You can’t dwell on that.	Tosobola kubeera ku ekyo.
I wish you were here with me.	Njagala wali wano nange.
That’s not all, either.	Ekyo si kyokka, era.
I like to talk face to face.	Njagala nnyo okwogera maaso ku maaso.
No one could see what he saw yet.	Tewali yali asobola kulaba kye yalaba n’okutuusa kati.
Maybe what you want to do isn’t the point.	Mpozzi ky’oyagala okukola si y’ensonga.
Maybe this is the week.	Mpozzi eno ye wiiki.
I'm not sure why.	Sikakasa nsonga lwaki.
How do you know	Omanyi otya .
I wonder what it is.	Nze nneebuuza kiki.
I love that book.	Njagala nnyo ekitabo ekyo.
We’re not the only ones.	Si ffe ffekka.
Or as it is.	Oba nga bwe kiri.
However, this was definitely not the case.	Kyokka, kino mazima ddala si bwe kyali.
I want to talk to him now.	Njagala okwogera naye kati.
This will probably be pretty close.	Kino osanga kijja kuba kumpi nnyo.
But there is one thing.	Naye waliwo ekintu kimu.
I don't know how to do it can you help.	Simanyi ngeri ya kukikola osobola okuyamba.
Apparently he didn’t have one.	Kirabika yali talina.
Obviously, this is a problem.	Kya lwatu nti kino kizibu.
Now, we don’t have something like that.	Kati, tetulina kintu nga ekyo.
That, at the same time, is a good thing.	Ekyo, mu kiseera kye kimu, kintu kirungi.
It’s harder than this.	Kizibu okusinga kino.
It is truly a beautiful place.	Mazima ddala kifo kirungi nnyo.
He certainly knows it.	Mazima ddala akimanyi.
He had his plans.	Yalina enteekateeka ze.
I wanted to win.	Nnali njagala kuwangula.
He must be like.	Alina okuba nga.
It’s not hard to do.	Si kizibu kukola.
Everything is fine.	Ekintu kyonna kiri bulungi.
And he can’t either.	Era naye tasobola.
What should we do?.	Tulina kukola ki?.
You are there to be in the moment.	Oli awo okubeera mu kiseera kino.
Anything, in this case, being me.	Ekintu kyonna, mu mbeera eno, okubeera nze.
He started making phone calls.	Yatandika okukuba essimu.
It wasn’t the room.	Si kye kyali kisenge.
Not in my car.	Si mu mmotoka yange.
I will, soon very soon.	Nja kukikola, mu bbanga ttono mu bbanga ttono ddala.
He didn’t want to play.	Yali tayagala kuzannya.
I was him.	Nze nali ye.
He was obviously doing well.	Kya lwatu nti yali akola bulungi.
I want him.	Njagala ye.
No.	Nedda.
Not for long, though.	Kyokka, si lwa bbanga ddene.
One has a lot of dogs.	Omu alina embwa nnyingi.
My wife is home alone.	Mukyala wange ali waka yekka.
However, this is not quite true.	Kyokka, kino si kituufu nnyo.
This may actually be true.	Kino mu butuufu kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
He has to be there.	Alina okubaawo.
In my opinion, it’s not harmful.	Mu ndowooza yange, si kya bulabe.
I am not sure about this .	Sikakasa ku kino .
He just couldn’t.	Ye yekka yali tasobola.
He looked very, very young.	Yalabika nga muto nnyo nnyo.
It’s a little more complicated than that.	Kizibu katono okusinga ekyo.
It is not this house.	Si ye nnyumba eno.
And that’s what we have.	Era ekyo kye tulina.
I can’t talk too much about it.	Sisobola kwogera nnyo ku nsonga eyo.
He has a problem with his wife.	Alina obuzibu ne mukyala we.
. . . .	.
Neither time nor money.	Wadde obudde wadde ssente.
I know it, my son.	Nkimanyi mwana wange.
It will come soon.	Kijja kujja mangu.
Right now, we both have a job to do.	Mu kiseera kino, ffembi tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
You were, are, and always will be a good man.	Ggwe wali, oli, era bulijjo ojja kuba musajja mulungi.
It’s hard to do.	Kizibu okukola.
My father was like that.	Taata bwe kyali.
I just didn’t care to go home.	Nze nnali sifaayo kudda waka.
It would be nice.	Kyandibadde kirungi.
But to himself alone.	Naye eri ye yekka.
You do everything.	Ggwe okola buli kimu.
It could be someone else coming.	Kiyinza okuba nga waliwo omuntu omulala ajja.
Will try soon.	Ajja kugezaako mu bbanga ttono.
No one heard it.	Tewali yawulira.
But here they are.	Naye wano we bali.
You will do it yourself.	Ojja kukikola wekka.
He really didn’t have time.	Mazima ddala yali talina budde.
In a sense, down.	Mu ngeri emu, wansi.
It was really great.	Ddala kyali kikulu nnyo.
That’s really hard to watch.	Ekyo ddala kizibu okulaba.
He was the only one he had.	Ye yali yekka gwe yalina.
I couldn’t get a job, me.	Nnali sisobola kufuna mulimu, nze.
I don’t even know what to say about that one.	Simanyi na kya kwogera ku oyo.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri.
I want it in any case.	Njagala mu mbeera yonna.
But of course you knew that.	Naye ddala ekyo wali okimanyi.
But he thinks anyway.	Naye alowooza mu ngeri yonna.
He could see something she couldn’t.	Yali asobola okulaba ekintu kye yali tasobola.
And it doesn’t matter.	Era si kikulu.
He didn’t want to admit it.	Yali tayagala kukkiriza nti kituufu.
This was his night.	Kino kye kyali ekiro kye.
I know, you want to be me.	Nkimanyi, oyagala okuba nze.
I needed that.	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga.
But we have it.	Naye tulina.
And you know what.	Era omanyi kiki.
It is very common.	Kya bulijjo nnyo.
And that was all he could say.	Era ekyo kyokka kye yali asobola okwogera.
Indeed, it was.	Mazima ddala, bwe kyali.
This can be helpful.	Kino kiyinza okuyamba.
That would be dangerous.	Ekyo kyandibadde kya bulabe.
I think he loves it there.	Ndowooza nti ayagala nnyo eyo.
Or it will happen.	Oba kijja kubaawo.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
I thought this was a really really good place.	Nalowooza nti kino ddala ddala kifo kirungi.
Not like here.	Si nga wano.
But he was doing it.	Naye yali akikola.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
But he couldn’t believe it.	Naye yali tasobola kukkiriza.
Perhaps that will come, in time.	Oboolyawo ekyo kijja kujja, mu kiseera.
It was a man’s place.	Kyali kifo kya musajja.
Certainly not us.	Mazima ddala si ffe.
I don’t want to see this place.	Saagala kulaba kifo kino.
It’s good that you’re here.	Kirungi nti oli wano.
I know that to be true.	Ekyo nkimanyi nti kituufu.
I love my dog.	Njagala nnyo embwa yange.
He would always be here.	Bulijjo yandibadde wano.
This is not entirely true.	Kino si kituufu ddala.
And what a great idea it was.	Era nga kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I couldn’t do that.	Ekyo nnali sisobola kukikola.
At that point.	Ku kifo ekyo.
He would have no choice.	Yandibadde talina kya kukola.
But he really wasn’t.	Naye mu butuufu si bwe yali.
I couldn’t be one.	Nnali sisobola kuba omu.
But neither is this.	Naye ne kino si bwe kiri.
I said I loved it.	Nagamba nti njagala nnyo.
In fact, that is not true.	Mu butuufu, ekyo si kituufu.
He obviously didn’t know what to do.	Kya lwatu nti yali tamanyi kya kukola.
This movie is for you.	Firimu eno ya ggwe.
I want a child.	Njagala mwana.
He'll go.	Ajja kugenda.
In good condition.	Mu mbeera nnungi.
He wasn’t going to do that.	Ekyo yali tagenda kukikola.
Not from mine.	Si okuva mu yange.
And in many ways, it is.	Era mu ngeri nnyingi, bwe kiri.
I am completely now.	Nze ndi ddala kati.
He speaks very well.	Ayogera bulungi nnyo.
And it was also good.	Era era kyali kirungi.
He should be fine though.	Alina okuba bulungi wadde.
Of course, not everything is.	Kya lwatu nti si buli kimu nti bwe kiri.
There is one problem.	Waliwo ekizibu kimu.
One can always get out of jail.	Omuntu bulijjo asobola okuva mu kkomera.
Basically the point is there.	Okusinga ensonga eri awo.
He talked about it openly.	Yayogera ku nsonga eyo mu lwatu.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
His father thought.	Taata we bwe yalowooza.
I loved it here.	Nnali njagala nnyo wano.
In your car.	Mu mmotoka yo.
I couldn’t find a good reason not to go.	Nnali sisobola kufuna nsonga nnungi lwaki nnali sigenda.
I know it was a while back.	Nkimanyi nti waliwo akaseera emabega.
Really hungry hungry.	Ddala enjala enjala.
It’s not easy at all.	Si kyangu n’akatono.
It is not the case.	Si bwe kiri.
He is not where he should be.	Tali we yandibadde.
He was a wonderful child.	Yali mwana mulungi nnyo.
We cannot know.	Tetusobola kumanya.
He thought about the time.	Yalowooza ku kiseera.
You can tell a lot about a man.	Osobola okubuulira bingi ku musajja.
He has a personality.	Alina omuntu.
But he is so much more than that.	Naye asinga nnyo ekyo.
I could say that.	Ekyo nnali nsobola okwogera.
Not even the one he himself expected.	Si wadde oyo ye kennyini gwe yali asuubira.
I love dogs.	Njagala nnyo embwa.
I had no idea what to expect exactly.	Nnali sirina kirowoozo kyonna ku kiki kye nnali nsuubira ddala.
Not so much a situation, perhaps.	Si mbeera nnyo, mpozzi.
I’m not sure how it is now.	Sikakasa bwe kiri kati.
I am lucky to have him.	Nnina omukisa okubeera naye.
He had time for us.	Yalina obudde gye tuli.
Planning is everything.	Enteekateeka kye buli kimu.
And they certainly are not to us.	Era mazima si bwe bali gye tuli.
He would like that.	Ekyo yandiyagadde.
We’ll go swimming.	Tujja kugenda okuwuga.
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
In your case, probably a pretty good job.	Mu mbeera yo, mpozzi omulimu omulungi ennyo.
But it’s not easy for anyone.	Naye si kyangu eri omuntu yenna.
Everyone will play at the same time.	Buli omu ajja kuzannya mu kiseera kye kimu.
The same goes for cars.	Kye kimu ne ku mmotoka.
I wonder if he knows this.	Nze nneebuuza oba kino akimanyi.
We are truly lucky.	Mazima ddala tuli ba mukisa.
I can’t go on living here.	Siyinza kugenda mu maaso nga mbeera wano.
It’s a very good opportunity.	Omukisa mulungi nnyo.
But here he was.	Naye wano we yali.
That was pretty cool.	Ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
I hope it’s a good idea.	Nsuubira nti kirowoozo kirungi.
We can’t do that.	Ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
You have to eat well.	Olina okulya obulungi.
He was all happy.	Yenna yali musanyufu.
Without his father.	Nga talina taata we.
He should have.	Yandibadde alina.
And you have it, too.	Era naawe olina.
But he already had a job.	Naye yalina dda omulimu.
I was scared, really really scared.	Nali ntya, ddala ddala nga ntya.
But this is not the point.	Naye eno si y’ensonga.
Not that it would matter.	Si nti kyandibadde kikulu.
Someone had to do it.	Waliwo omuntu yalina okukikola.
In practice, it’s very difficult.	Mu nkola, kizibu nnyo.
He was very strong and powerful.	Yali wa maanyi nnyo era nga wa maanyi.
Everyone wants to win.	Buli muntu ayagala kuwangula.
Nothing too serious, though.	Kyokka, tewali kintu kya maanyi nnyo.
I’m doing pretty well.	Nkola bulungi nnyo.
And everyone else.	Ne buli omu.
And it’s very low-key.	Era nga kya wansi nnyo.
I pray he did.	Nsaba yakikola.
I guess he thought the same thing about me.	Ntebereza nti naye yalowooza ekintu kye kimu ku nze.
I was all ready.	Nze ffenna nnali mwetegefu.
That is the only truth.	Ekyo kye kituufu kyokka.
He obviously didn’t know.	Kya lwatu nti yali tamanyi.
What a thought!.	Nga ndowooza!.
Obviously you don’t.	Kya lwatu tolina.
. . . .	.
Beauty isn’t everything.	Obulungi si buli kimu.
It was worse than that.	Kyali kibi okusinga ekyo.
He had already gone to town.	Yali yagenda dda mu kibuga.
I'll just carry on as it is now.	Nja kumala kugenda mu maaso nga bwe kiri kati.
He wasn’t real.	Yali si wa ddala.
That’s all he needs.	Ekyo kyokka kye yeetaaga.
But that’s too easy.	Naye ekyo kyangu nnyo.
This is a serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi.
But no luck so far.	Naye tewali mukisa okutuusa kati.
Filmmaking is a job.	Okukola firimu mulimu.
And of course I do.	Era ddala nkola.
You probably won’t know how much.	Oboolyawo tojja kumanya ssente mmeka.
It’s up to you, of course.	Kiri gy’oli, ddala.
A lot of money.	Ssente nnyingi.
But that doesn’t matter to me now.	Naye ekyo si kikulu gyendi kati.
But he really didn’t need to.	Naye ddala yali teyeetaaga.
Clearly, it is not.	Kya lwatu nti si bwe kiri.
They are not the police.	Si ba poliisi.
You proceed in this way.	Ogenda mu maaso mu ngeri eno.
Of course he had, and he had no problems at all.	Kya lwatu yalina, era nga talina buzibu n’akatono.
I am not lucky with this either.	Kino nange sirina mukisa.
No one is in any trouble here.	Tewali ali mu buzibu bwonna wano.
I’m going really fast.	Nze ngenda mangu ddala.
That’s fine, you can do that.	Ekyo kirungi, ekyo osobola okukikola.
I would love to see it coming.	Njagala nnyo okulaba nga ejja.
That’s very important up front.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo mu maaso.
Almost there, but not quite.	Kumpi awo, naye si ddala.
However, in the short term.	Kyokka mu bbanga ttono.
He said it wasn’t.	Yagambye nti si bwe kiri.
I thought she was beautiful.	Nalowooza nti yali mulungi.
There is no doing anything.	Tewali kukola kintu kyonna.
It might just happen.	Kiyinza okumala okubaawo.
Not nearly at all.	Si kumpi n’akatono.
He is not real.	Si wa ddala.
Maybe he was in school.	Mpozzi yali mu ssomero.
Nothing can be good again.	Tewali kiyinza kuddamu kuba bulungi.
It’s as simple as that.	Kyangu nga ekyo.
He didn’t want to do it.	Yali tayagala kukikola.
Now everything seems real.	Kati buli kimu kirabika nga kya ddala.
Or from me, either.	Oba okuva gyendi, oba.
It’s not just mine.	Si kyange kyokka.
I think it was.	Ndowooza bwe kyali.
He always needed money.	Bulijjo yali yeetaaga ssente.
No! 	Nedda!
That’s not all there is to it.	Ekyo si kye kyokka.
He was very good, you know.	Yali mulungi nnyo, omanyi.
And of course he was talking about her.	Era ddala yali ayogera ku ye.
Really bad actually.	Ddala kibi mu butuufu.
It was definitely him.	Mazima ddala yali ye.
They were what they were.	Baali kye baali.
You could say it was sudden.	Oyinza okugamba nti kyali kya bwangu.
I was just a kid.	Nnali mwana muto yekka.
He said so much.	Yayogera bingi nnyo.
That is very difficult.	Ekyo kizibu nnyo.
It’s quick and fast.	Kya bwangu era kya mangu.
I love doing this.	Kino njagala nnyo okukikola.
And it’s good.	Era kirungi.
This can be a money issue.	Kino kiyinza okuba ensonga ya ssente.
The money is good.	Ssente nnungi.
He looked so normal.	Yalabika nga wa bulijjo nnyo.
He had no choice, he knew that now.	Yali talina kya kukola, ekyo yali akimanyi kati.
In every case.	Mu buli mbeera.
I thought this was a great idea.	Nalowooza nti kino kyali kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
I don’t know what it is.	Simanyi kye kiri.
However, this is not true.	Kyokka, kino si kituufu.
It’s very difficult.	Kizibu nnyo.
But not for long.	Naye si lwa bbanga ddene.
And he felt the same way about me.	Era nange naye yawulira bw’atyo.
He didn’t know who it was.	Yali tamanyi ani.
Nothing really important.	Tewali kintu kikulu ddala.
Very good, too.	Kirungi nnyo, era.
It seems so long ago now.	Kirabika dda nnyo kati.
Not much, but definitely a bit.	Si bingi, naye ddala katono.
He's doing really well.	Akola bulungi ddala.
He went ahead anyway.	Yagenda mu maaso mu ngeri yonna.
From believing on.	Okuva ku kukkiriza ku.
Just one thing.	Ekintu kimu kyokka.
He had a plan.	Yalina enteekateeka.
I need to know what that was.	Nnina okumanya ekyo kye kyali.
This thing is the same.	Ekintu kino kye kimu.
He had everything.	Yalina buli kimu.
We are almost to this point.	Tuli kumpi okutuuka ku kiseera kino.
We are all the same.	Ffenna tuli.
That was a very important thing.	Ekyo kyali kikulu nnyo.
It’s going to happen.	Kigenda kubaawo.
He moved forward quickly.	Yagenda mu maaso mu bwangu.
I have it too.	Nange nnina.
He wasn’t thinking at all.	Yali talowooza n’akatono.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
I really, really, really like it.	Ddala, ddala, ddala njagala.
You're not with me.	Toli nange.
He is here now.	Ali wano kati.
Not even my brother.	Wadde muganda wange.
But she is a beautiful woman.	Naye mukyala mulungi.
I didn’t know anyone.	Nnali sirina gwe mmanyi.
I was planning on driving down today.	Nali nteekateeka kuvuga wansi leero.
I knew it.	Nali nkimanyi.
He is very, very good.	Mulungi nnyo nnyo.
No one wants that.	Ekyo tewali ayagala.
You absolutely have.	Olina ddala.
That was always the case, he knew.	Ekyo bwe kyali bulijjo, yali akimanyi.
Getting in trouble.	Okufuna obuzibu.
It’s easy to do.	Kyangu okukola.
That’s all they were.	Ekyo kyokka kye baali.
We have to work.	Tulina okukola.
You’re there.	Ggwe oli awo.
What a wonderful time.	Nga kiseera kirungi nnyo.
I always have to work.	Bulijjo nnina okukola.
This isn’t just us.	Kino si ffe ffekka.
He won’t know.	Tajja kumanya.
You have to be at work on time.	Olina okubeera ku mulimu mu budde.
Someone has to do it.	Waliwo alina okukikola.
It’s a matter of love.	Ensonga ya kwagala.
He knows his stuff.	Amanyi ebintu bye.
He can’t be here.	Tasobola kubeera wano.
Why why why.	Lwaki lwaki lwaki.
This is, in fact, true.	Kino, mu butuufu, kituufu.
. . . .	.
He doesn’t think he’ll last long.	Talowooza nti ajja kumala bbanga ddene.
This is complicated, and complicated.	Kino kizibu, era kizibu.
Apparently that is not to be.	Kirabika ekyo si kya kubeera.
She really should go home, she thought.	Ddala alina okudda eka, bwe yalowooza.
Maybe he was already asleep.	Mpozzi nga yali yeebase dda.
Anyone want to go for a ride?.	Waliwo ayagala okugenda okuvuga?.
That’s what he told me to do.	Ekyo kye yang’amba okukola.
This is much more important than that.	Kino kikulu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
He needed one.	Yali yeetaaga emu.
Perhaps, in a sense, he was.	Oboolyawo, mu ngeri emu, yali.
You know .	Omanyi .
He does the same thing.	Akola ekintu kye kimu.
I’ve been young, too.	Nange mbadde muto.
And that’s basically it.	Era ekyo okusinga kye kiri.
Anything but this.	Ekintu kyonna okuggyako kino.
I will, of course.	Nja kukikola, ddala.
You’re always at school and that’s it.	Bulijjo oli ku ssomero era ekyo.
But he was very handsome.	Naye yali alabika bulungi nnyo.
Which is hard for anyone to do.	Ekintu ekizibu omuntu yenna okukola.
But we have to consider the situation.	Naye tulina okulowooza ku mbeera.
Thinking too much is really easy.	Okulowooza ennyo kyangu ddala.
I live in that too.	Nze nange mbeera mu ekyo.
Call my dad.	Kuba taata wange essimu.
That is very true.	Ekyo kituufu nnyo.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo nnyo.
He is here alone.	Ali wano yekka.
It was a very difficult problem.	Kyali kizibu ekizibu ennyo.
How lucky we are.	Nga tuli ba mukisa.
He started to back away.	Yatandika okudda emabega.
That may be the problem.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kye kizibu.
But there was nothing.	Naye nga tewali.
This is a real moment.	Kino kiseera kya ddala.
It was what it seemed.	Kye kyali kirabika.
You are not normal.	Ggwe toli wa bulijjo.
This is what everyone wants.	Kino buli muntu ky’ayagala.
However, he will not	Kyokka, tajja .
You know how it is.	Omanyi bwe kiri.
But he thought he would try.	Naye yalowooza nti ajja kugezaako.
I would love to help.	Njagala nnyo okuyamba.
That’s really powerful.	Ekyo ddala kya maanyi.
However, this is not the case.	Kyokka kino si bwe kiri.
Indeed and truly I am.	Mazima era mu butuufu nze.
I have to speak now.	Nnina okwogera kati.
I already knew.	Nali mmanyi dda.
If that was the case.	Singa ekyo kye kyali.
Not that he would.	Si nti yandikoze.
Everything was so easy.	Buli kimu kyali kyangu nnyo.
That will last about an hour.	Ekyo kijja kumala essaawa nga emu.
To which he readily agreed.	Ekyo kye yakkiriza mangu.
Every player needs work.	Buli muzannyi yeetaaga omulimu.
He was ready.	Yali mwetegefu.
It’s coming.	Kye kijja.
It was as simple as that.	Kyali kyangu nga ekyo.
Yeah and not talking.	Ye era si kwogera.
He told me it was his job.	Yang’amba nti gwe mulimu gwe.
It was definitely mine.	Mazima ddala kyali kyange.
You are also a blessing to me right now.	Naawe oli mukisa gyendi mu kiseera kino.
He did not want to see this happen.	Kino yali tayagala kulaba nga kigenda mu maaso.
You are not the same as him.	Ggwe si kye kimu naye.
And his wife	Ne mukyala we .
But that is not the case.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri.
My father was fine.	Taata yali bulungi.
Like anyone else.	Nga omuntu yenna agenda okuddamu.
I can’t eat anything anymore.	Sisobola kuddamu kulya kintu kyonna.
This is great, bye.	Kino kirungi nnyo, bye.
Or he did it.	Oba yakikola.
The thing is, well .	Ekintu kiri nti, bulungi .
This is a very difficult time.	Kino kiseera kizibu nnyo.
This is three weeks in.	Eno wiiki ssatu mu...
Certainly not you.	Mazima ddala si ggwe.
He doesn’t have to be good.	Talina kuba mulungi.
Then everything happened so fast.	Awo buli kimu ne kigenda mu maaso mu bwangu nnyo.
He obviously wanted that.	Kya lwatu nti ekyo yali ayagala nnyo.
We were alone together back here.	Twali ffekka wamu emabega wano.
He is just one person.	Ye muntu omu yekka.
He is my favorite.	Ye muganzi wange nnyo.
I have a plan too.	Nange nnina enteekateeka.
He didn’t think you would.	Yali talowooza nti ojja kukikola.
This isn’t just me.	Kino si kyange nzekka.
This is a very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
I'm actually a little nervous myself.	Mu butuufu nze kennyini ntya katono.
I am doing my job.	Nkola omulimu gwange.
Now when is this.	Kati kino ddi...
And he loves and loves.	Era ayagala nnyo era ayagala.
Not the same but close, probably.	Si kye kimu naye nga kiri kumpi, oboolyawo.
This is a complex problem.	Kino kizibu kizibu nnyo.
And he was working hard too.	Era naye yali akola nnyo.
I knew better than to do that.	Nze nnali mmanyi okusinga okukola ekyo.
Certainly not for the office.	Mazima ddala si lwa ofiisi.
But he was alone.	Naye yali yekka.
There is no me really.	Tewali nze ddala.
But it’s something.	Naye kintu.
He is very beautiful.	Mulungi nnyo.
I doubt it will happen.	Nbuusabuusa nti kijja kubaawo.
I won’t do it.	Sijja kukikola.
That’s right there.	Ekyo kiri awo.
I might have made a lot of money.	Nnyinza okuba nga nnali nfunye ssente nnyingi.
He loved it there.	Yali ayagala nnyo eyo.
He is a very young child.	Ye mwana muto nnyo.
There is no way I know.	Tewali ngeri yonna gye mmanyi.
Maybe that was the point.	Mpozzi eyo ye yali ensonga.
But we will win.	Naye tujja kuwangula.
It’s not what we all are.	Si kye tuli ffenna.
But not because of the plan.	Naye si lwa nteekateeka.
And that could happen at any time.	Era ekyo kiyinza okubaawo essaawa yonna.
No one has to know anything.	Tewali muntu yenna alina kumanya kintu kyonna.
You won’t want to eat there.	Tojja kwagala kulya eyo.
It’s so easy for everyone.	Kyangu nnyo eri buli muntu.
Maybe he was.	Mpozzi nga yali.
I don’t know how to proceed.	Simanyi ngeri ya kugenda mu maaso.
He had the time.	Yalina obudde.
He was very sick.	Yali mulwadde nnyo.
My other .	Omulala wange .
Here that is all we can do.	Wano ekyo kyokka kye tusobola okukola.
But that's not the point here.	Naye eyo si y'ensonga wano.
But he did it tonight.	Naye yakikola ekiro kino.
There was nothing he wanted to see here.	Tewali kye yali ayagala kulaba wano.
There are three reasons or this.	Waliwo ensonga ssatu oba eno.
He didn’t know he had it in him.	Yali tamanyi nti yalina mu ye.
It’s very hard to get.	Kizibu nnyo okufuna.
One person to another.	Omuntu omu eri omulala.
I had no choice.	Nnali sirina kye nnyinza kukola.
You probably don’t even know.	Oboolyawo tomanyi na.
Nothing out of the ordinary here.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo wano.
You don’t want to do this.	Kino toyagala kukikola.
But that’s what he did.	Naye ekyo kye yakola.
But he fell asleep.	Naye yeebase.
He was so happy that night.	Yali musanyufu nnyo ekiro ekyo.
It’s not about us.	Si ku ffe.
We are very close friends.	Tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
He just had to get home.	Yalina okutuuka awaka kyokka.
Perhaps you can do it.	Oboolyawo oyinza okukikola.
Only one of the same.	Omu yekka ku kimu.
I love being here.	Njagala nnyo okubeera wano.
But he is also very good.	Naye naye mulungi nnyo.
He knew it, and he probably knew it too.	Yali akimanyi, era oboolyawo naye yali akimanyi.
The day, without trouble.	Olunaku, nga tewali buzibu.
He was that optimistic.	Yalina essuubi bw’atyo.
I don’t even want to know about that.	Saagala na kumanya ku ekyo.
He had to see his brother, too.	Yalina okulaba muganda we, naye.
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
No one came.	Tewali yajja.
She was indeed very good.	Mazima ddala yali mulungi nnyo.
He's going home tomorrow.	Agenda kudda waka enkya.
But for the most part, it’s not.	Naye okusinga, si bwe kiri.
Although they are.	Wadde nga bwe bali.
But now that won’t happen.	Naye kati ekyo tekijja kubaawo.
We needed help.	Twali twetaaga obuyambi.
He wanted it, it was all.	Yali ayagala, kye kyokka kye kyali.
We'll just go.	Tujja kumala kugenda.
That might work .	Ekyo kiyinza okukola .
But he is a young child.	Naye ye mwana muto.
That was no, no.	Ekyo kyali nedda, nedda.
I thought only of myself.	Nalowooza ku nze nzekka.
It’s not hard to do.	Si kizibu kukola.
He always had so much.	Bulijjo yalina bingi nnyo.
I can be that guy.	Nsobola okuba ggaayi oyo.
He could do it again.	Yali asobola okuddamu okukikola.
He didn’t seem to want to work.	Yalabika nga tayagala kukola.
This can be very helpful.	Kino kiyinza okuyamba ennyo.
We will stay all night in any case.	Tujja kubeera ekiro kyonna mu mbeera yonna.
I will do it myself.	Nze kennyini nja kukikola.
However, this is not a realistic assumption.	Kyokka, kino si kirowoozo kituufu.
He is real.	Ye wa ddala.
Talking would be really bad.	Okwogera kyandibadde kibi ddala.
Good to talk to you.	Kirungi okwogera naawe.
And so he should be.	Era bw’atyo yandibadde.
It’s just true.	Kituufu kyokka.
I don’t want to go to jail.	Saagala kugenda mu kkomera.
It is very difficult to preach here.	Kizibu nnyo okubuulira wano.
And very dangerous.	Era nga ya bulabe nnyo.
This is not an issue.	Eno si nsonga.
You look great today.	Olabika bulungi nnyo leero.
We have something.	Tulina kye tulina.
But there is .	Naye waliwo .
You and us?.	Ggwe naffe?.
Maybe very well.	Mpozzi bulungi nnyo.
He knew that had to happen.	Yali akimanyi nti ekyo kyalina okubaawo.
And there is no one.	Era tewali muntu yenna.
I think he would rather be in school today.	Ndowooza yandibadde asinga kubeera mu ssomero leero.
This is a good practice.	Eno nkola nnungi.
Everyone knows that.	Ekyo buli omu akimanyi.
I want to eat one.	Njagala kulya emu.
He would if he could, but he couldn’t.	Yandikoze singa yali asobola, naye nga tasobola.
I don’t want to be here.	Saagala kubeera wano.
I need more than that.	Nze nneetaaga okusinga ekyo.
Not that he would do that either.	Si nti naye ekyo yandikoze.
It would be prison.	Kyandibadde kya kkomera.
You’re going to have to be in one place.	Ogenda kuba olina okuba mu kifo kimu.
And now he had it.	Era kati yalina.
But it wasn’t.	Naye si bwe kyali.
She was a lucky woman.	Yali mukyala wa mukisa.
Maybe that was all he wanted to do.	Mpozzi ekyo kyokka kye yali ayagala okukola.
Even if it is you.	Wadde ye ggwe.
I couldn’t find any reason.	Nnali sisobola kufuna nsonga yonna.
He had to do it.	Yali alina okukikola.
I am the only good person.	Nze nzekka omuntu omulungi.
Maybe they’re not.	Mpozzi nga si bwe bali.
I don’t have one.	Nze sirina emu.
He may be here.	Ayinza okuba wano.
I go every day.	Ngenda buli lunaku.
Since my time.	Okuva mu kiseera kyange.
However, it was something.	Kyokka, kyali kintu.
That’s not always easy to do though.	Ekyo si kyangu bulijjo kukola wadde.
I’m afraid there is.	Ntya nti waliwo.
Very close to him.	Kumpi nnyo naye.
It probably won’t come.	Oboolyawo tekijja kujja.
But it’s a reason.	Naye nga nsonga.
I can help.	Nsobola okuyamba.
That was really hard for me.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo ddala gyendi.
Everyone knows this very, very well.	Kino buli muntu akimanyi bulungi nnyo nnyo.
Now he is asleep.	Kati yeebase.
We will be with everyone.	Tujja kuba ne buli muntu.
He was a very nice man.	Yali musajja mulungi nnyo.
Everyone knows exactly where they are.	Buli omu amanyi bulungi gye bali.
It would be difficult.	Kyandibadde kizibu.
I think it will happen.	Ndowooza kijja kubaawo.
It’s not right now.	Si kituufu kati.
Very nice house.	Ennyumba nnungi nnyo.
And that may be true.	Era ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
But he is young and sick.	Naye muto era mulwadde.
She looked beautiful and strong and happy.	Yalabika bulungi era nga wa maanyi era nga musanyufu.
They are here now, in this moment.	Bali wano kati, mu kiseera kino.
But he knew he would never do such a thing.	Naye yali akimanyi nti tajja kukola kintu ng’ekyo.
Now he was almost alone.	Kati yali kumpi yekka.
He wasn’t a man.	Yali si musajja.
Indeed, it would be difficult.	Mazima ddala, kyandibadde kizibu.
That was realistic.	Ekyo kyali kya ddala.
Maybe you can talk to him .	Mpozzi osobola okwogera naye .
To be one of us.	Okubeera omu ku ffe.
I wonder why that is.	Nze nneebuuza lwaki bwe kiri.
I have no expectations.	Sirina kye nsuubira.
It doesn’t matter now.	Si kikulu kati.
He said he would do it.	Yagambye nti agenda kukikola.
But they’re not as friendly as it seems.	Naye si ba mukwano nga bwe kirabika.
Everywhere we go we go together.	Buli gye tugenda tugenda ffembi.
He was a human being.	Yali muntu.
But other than that, everything was normal.	Naye okuggyako ekyo, buli kimu kyali kya bulijjo.
I feel younger.	Mpulira nga ndi muto.
No really, everywhere.	Nedda ddala, buli wamu.
And he couldn't say anything, either.	Era yali tasobola kwogera kintu kyonna, era.
I can't speak.	Sisobola kwogera.
Now it’s a school.	Kati ssomero.
I am the only one	Nze nzekka nze .
And everyone knew it.	Era buli omu yali akimanyi.
Making a lot of money.	Okukola ssente nnyingi.
Everything is fine now.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi kati.
It’s not for anyone, really.	Si kya muntu yenna, ddala.
That’s what dinner is.	Ekyo kye kiri ekyeggulo.
I want it here.	Njagala wano.
That’s where he was.	Awo we yali.
He isn’t like that.	Si bw’atyo.
He was in, well.	Yali mu, bulungi.
Not much, certainly.	Si bingi, mazima ddala.
I don’t know what could happen.	Simanyi kiyinza kubaawo.
Getting to the room.	Okutuuka mu kisenge.
As a person.	Nga omuntu.
It would be very busy.	Kyandibadde bbize nnyo.
I want my dinner.	Njagala ekyeggulo kyange.
He is at school right now.	Ali ku ssomero mu kiseera kino.
And there certainly is.	Era mazima ddala waliwo.
And he's not here.	Era tali wano.
It’s not good to read.	Si kirungi okusoma.
I have to talk to him.	Nnina okwogera naye.
He is a good child.	Ye mwana mulungi.
He knew it at this point.	Yali akimanyi mu kiseera kino.
We can’t live together.	Tetusobola kubeera wamu.
And that’s not where we are.	Era awo si we tuli.
But you can’t tell.	Naye tosobola kumanya.
For me it’s easy.	Nze kyangu.
I'll make the time.	Nja kukola obudde.
The movie is not mine.	Firimu si yange.
I have to speak.	Nnina okwogera.
That’s not really me.	Ekyo mu butuufu si nze.
I don’t know when.	Simanyi ddi.
In fact, everyone was asleep.	Mu butuufu, buli omu yali yeebase.
Like, you know how it is.	Nga, omanyi bwe kiri.
He was himself.	Ye yali ye kennyini.
He seemed happy and at ease.	Yalabika nga musanyufu era nga talina buzibu.
Please can you .	Nsaba osobola .
Probably not me.	Oboolyawo si nze.
That, apparently, was that.	Ekyo, kirabika, kye kyali ekyo.
He didn't know when she left.	Yali tamanyi ddi lwe yagenda.
However, here is the point.	Kyokka, wano we wali ensonga.
She looked good, but not exactly festive.	Yalabika bulungi, naye nga si wa mbaga ddala.
It was his car.	Yali mmotoka ye.
He couldn’t do it with you there.	Yali tasobola kukikola naawe eyo.
My father is there with him now.	Taata ali awo naye kati.
I didn’t know why, really.	Nnali simanyi lwaki, ddala.
I have a problem.	Nze nnina ekizibu.
Or in jail, obviously.	Oba mu kkomera, kya lwatu.
And then we can do the same.	Era awo naffe tusobola okukola ekintu kye kimu.
He has to deal with those.	Alina okukola ku ebyo.
I don’t know, he thought.	Simanyi, bwe yalowooza.
That was all it was.	Ekyo kyokka kye kyali.
That it was the same for me.	Nti nange kyali kye kimu.
That’s not good though.	Ekyo si kirungi wadde.
I am not happy.	Siri musanyufu.
I need immediate help.	Njagala buyambi bwa bwangu.
You know you can’t be that.	Omanyi tosobola kuba ekyo.
He was her best friend.	Yali mukwano gwe ennyo.
In us and in us.	Mu ffe naffe.
But he couldn’t quite believe it.	Naye yali tasobola kukkiriza bulungi.
You may not know.	Oyinza okuba nga tomanyi.
It’s easy and convenient.	Kyangu era kirungi.
We are so close.	Tuli kumpi nnyo.
He made a lot of money.	Yakola ssente nnyingi.
Everybody knew everybody.	Buli omu yali amanyi buli muntu.
You don’t want to be in a hurry.	Toyagala kubeera mu bwangu.
It was very, very bad.	Kyali kibi nnyo nnyo.
I don’t belong to anything.	Siri wa kintu kyonna.
Like, right now.	Nga, mu kiseera kino.
You know how to talk.	Omanyi okwogera.
I am not a child.	Nze siri mwana.
He had nothing.	Yali talina kintu kyonna.
I’m not in a hurry.	Nze siri mu bwangu.
No, more than that.	Nedda, okusinga ekyo.
He wants to move on.	Ayagala okugenda mu maaso.
Someone else will help.	Omuntu omulala ajja okuyamba.
Not to me, anyway.	Si gyendi, mu ngeri yonna.
I’m sure you know.	Nkakasa nti omanyi.
I just know it’s a lot.	Nze mmanyi kyokka nti bingi.
But he wants to.	Naye ayagala.
That is his problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kye.
Work is very important.	Okukola kikulu nnyo.
Nothing is too important and nothing is too important.	Tewali kikulu nnyo era tewali kikulu nnyo.
No one will talk to me.	Tewali ajja kwogera nange.
It’s definitely a good time.	Mazima ddala kiseera kirungi.
He had it now.	Yalina kati.
Good job, everyone.	Omulimu omulungi, buli muntu.
Just a little bit here and there.	Katono ddala wano ne wali.
This is both a good and a bad thing.	Kino kintu kirungi era kibi.
Maybe the bottom is in.	Mpozzi wansi ali mu.
This is a practical problem.	Kino kizibu kya nkola.
He was so young, and so young and so fast.	Yali muto nnyo, era nga muto era nga ya bwangu nnyo.
But there we have it.	Naye eyo gye tulina.
It is not the case here.	Si bwe kiri wano.
Certainly not out of love.	Mazima ddala si lwa kwagala.
And ready to talk.	Era nga mwetegefu okwogera.
They are both really good friends.	Bombi ba mukwano ddala.
We have to do it right.	Tulina okukikola obulungi.
But he will do it.	Naye ajja kukikola.
It would be nice to really go.	Kyandibadde kirungi okugenda ddala.
It will always be there.	Bulijjo kijja kubaawo.
But there it is.	Naye awo we kiri.
Today, maybe we are.	Leero, mpozzi ffe.
It’s not a very real thing right now.	Si kintu kituufu nnyo mu kiseera kino.
You're a father.	Oli taata.
And that’s going on.	Era ekyo kigenda mu maaso.
I need hope .	Nze nneetaaga essuubi .
That is very dangerous.	Ekyo kya bulabe nnyo.
It was an intense process.	Yali nkola ya maanyi nnyo.
I really don’t know what to do.	Mazima ddala simanyi kya kukola.
Nothing seems to be happening.	Tewali kirabika kigenda mu maaso.
You want to be like him.	Ggwe oyagala okubeera nga ye.
But we are what we are.	Naye ffe kye tuli.
At the time I wasn’t sure why.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali sikakasa lwaki.
I love it too.	Nze nange njagala nnyo.
I have plenty of time.	Nnina obudde bungi.
He knew it.	Yali akimanyi.
I have nothing to say about it.	Sirina kye nnyinza kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
And he still can’t say what he saw then.	Era n’okutuusa kati tasobola kwogera kye yalaba mu kiseera ekyo.
It’s us.	Ye ffe.
It just had to be the way it is.	Kyalina okuba nga bwe kiri kyokka.
I'll do it again tomorrow.	Nja kuddamu okukikola enkya.
He had no reason.	Yali talina nsonga.
It was a good plan.	Yali nteekateeka nnungi.
And it’s not mine.	Era si kyange.
So far so good!.	N'okutuusa kati kirungi nnyo!.
No one knew how he would do in the background.	Tewali yali amanyi ngeri gye yandikoze mu bbanga.
I have been planning.	Mbadde nteekateeka.
But you can’t do anything about it.	Naye tosobola kukola kintu kyonna ku nsonga eyo.
He’s going to get paid.	Agenda kufuna ssente.
Certainly not being busy all the time.	Mazima ddala si kubeera bbize buli kiseera.
No, that was me.	Nedda, oyo nnali nze.
No one is alone here.	Wano tewali ali yekka.
He knew what he wanted to say.	Yali amanyi kye yali ayagala okwogera.
However, we have no choice.	Kyokka, tetulina kya kukola.
It was a common place in his day.	Kyali kifo kya bulijjo mu kiseera kye.
This way it will be good for both of us.	Mu ngeri eno kijja kuba kirungi gye tuli ffembi.
But it is the thing.	Naye kye kintu.
He couldn't answer.	Yali tasobola kuddamu.
I can’t deal with that idea.	Sisobola kukola ku ndowooza eyo.
Now, he had no reason to.	Kati, yali talina nsonga lwaki.
He knew better.	Yali amanyi bulungi.
This is very common.	Kino kya bulijjo nnyo.
But of course it wasn’t.	Naye ddala si bwe kyali.
And it was very easy.	Era kyali kyangu nnyo.
It is indeed very difficult.	Mazima ddala kizibu nnyo.
Nothing was happening.	Tewali kyali kigenda mu maaso.
If not.	Singa nedda.
It’s not for everyone, of course.	Si ya buli muntu, ddala.
It’s so easy not to.	Kyangu nnyo obutakola.
And not just in the classroom.	Era si mu kibiina kyokka.
Not too serious, really.	Si kya maanyi nnyo, ddala.
I like to say this in many ways.	Njagala nnyo okwogera kino mu ngeri nnyingi.
Maybe it’s dangerous, or maybe not.	Mpozzi nga kya bulabe, oba mpozzi nedda.
But it’s not just that.	Naye si ekyo kyokka.
But we have everything we need.	Naye ffe buli kye twetaaga.
I was afraid.	Nali ntya.
But now, it was my turn.	Naye kati, kyali kiseera kyange.
Where he went.	Gye yagenda.
No knowledge of anything.	Tewali kumanya ku kintu kyonna.
And so do we.	Era naffe.
I'm not quite sure how.	Sikakasa bulungi ngeri ki.
This is my all and everything.	Kino kye kyonna kyange era buli kimu.
Until it wasn’t.	Okutuusa nga si bwe kyali.
But not while we’re there.	Naye si nga tuli eyo.
But that was wrong.	Naye ekyo kyali kibi.
That’s probably true right now.	Ekyo oboolyawo kituufu mu kiseera kino.
He seems to be coming along quite well.	Kirabika ajja bulungi nnyo.
He can do that.	Ayinza okukola ekyo.
He did what he had to do.	Yakola kye yalina okukola.
You’re so busy.	Oli bbize nnyo.
That’s what that house is.	Ekyo ennyumba eyo kye kiri.
No one would want that.	Ekyo tewali yandiyagadde.
And he should have done it right.	Era yandibadde akikola bulungi.
I almost can’t believe it.	Kumpi sisobola kukkiriza.
It was ordinary.	Kyali kya bulijjo.
Whoever comes comes.	Oyo yenna ajja ajja.
He has his wife with him.	Alina mukyala we naye.
This is the room.	Kino kye kisenge.
But he was also making a point.	Naye era yali ayogera ensonga.
He said it was none of my business.	Yagambye nti si nsonga yange.
Nothing good was going to happen.	Tewali kirungi kyali kigenda kubaawo.
This is true even today.	Kino kituufu ne leero.
You will be able to talk to yourself.	Ojja kusobola okwogera naawe kennyini.
He was a very manly man.	Yali musajja nnyo.
I could do without it.	Nnali nsobola okukikola nga tewali.
Here's my problem.	Wano ekizibu kyange.
That’s the good thing.	Ekyo kye kirungi.
It would be easier, of course.	Kyandibadde kyangu, ddala.
A ??? 	Omu ???
It’s awful, really.	Kibi nnyo, ddala.
I feel better now.	Mpulira bulungi kati.
He is alone.	Ali yekka.
That's why we don't really have a relationship today.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki mu butuufu tetulina mukwano leero.
Nobody wanted to make money.	Tewali yali ayagala kukola ssente.
I may have you late in the evening .	Nnyinza okuba naawe akawungeezi ennyo .
I don’t want to know.	Saagala kumanya.
You have to eat too.	Naawe olina okulya.
He was in a really tough spot.	Yali mu kifo ekizibu ddala.
The point is this.	Ensonga eri nti eno.
You are truly blessed, that is with us today.	Ddala oli wa mukisa, ekyo kiri naffe leero.
To us that seems fine.	Eri ffe ekyo kirabika nga kirungi.
I want a friendly friend.	Njagala mukwano gwa mukwano.
Thinking hard.	Okulowooza ennyo.
It was downstairs.	Kyali wansi.
And that goes right up to the moment.	Era ekyo kigenda ddala okutuuka mu kiseera kino.
Not quite as strong.	Si nnyo nga ya maanyi.
He agreed immediately.	Yakkiriza mangu ddala.
Good, he thought.	Kirungi, bwe yalowooza.
I really can’t know.	Mazima ddala sisobola kumanya.
No it wasn’t.	Nedda si bwe kyali.
Back to the point.	Okudda ku nsonga.
You just have to move forward.	Olina okugenda mu maaso kyokka.
He wanted to talk to me.	Yali ayagala okwogera nange.
I was in his house.	Nnali mu nnyumba ye.
This plan is in place.	Enteekateeka eno eri mu nkola.
I already knew.	Nali mmanyi dda.
You can hardly see.	Tosobola bulungi kulaba.
And you and he .	Era ggwe ne ye .
Really, every way.	Ddala, buli ngeri.
Tomorrow would do better.	Enkya yandikoze bulungi.
And we were very close.	Era twali tuli kumpi nnyo.
Very good actually.	Kirungi nnyo mu butuufu.
It was that .	Kyali nti .
That’s what I wanted to say.	Ekyo nnali njagala okwogera.
Only one or the other can.	Omu yekka oba omulala asobola.
I couldn’t really say anything.	Mu butuufu nnali sisobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
It might just be me.	Kiyinza okuba nga nze nzekka.
I will do it though.	Nja kukikola wadde.
You think he’ll be here all the time.	Olowooza ajja kubeera wano buli kiseera.
He knew very well.	Yali amanyi bulungi nnyo.
I have to move on.	Nnina okugenda mu maaso.
He needed a reason.	Yali yeetaaga ensonga.
Now you want one.	Kati oyagala emu.
Not here, not now.	Si wano, si kati.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
That would be him.	Ekyo kyandibadde ye.
No it really isn’t.	Nedda ddala si bwe kiri.
I was ready for this.	Nnali mwetegefu ku kino.
It is absolutely right now.	Kiri ddala mu kiseera kino.
What does he do with that?.	Ekyo akikola ki ekizibu?.
That was it for me.	Ekyo kye kyali gyendi.
Someone he knew.	Omuntu gwe yali amanyi.
Here he was.	Wano we yali.
He doesn’t seem to be afraid of anyone.	Alabika talina muntu yenna atya.
Call the office or myself.	Kuba ofiisi oba nze kennyini.
That goes the same for you.	Ekyo kigenda kye kimu gy’oli.
But it’s realistic.	Naye nga kya ddala.
It seems normal.	Kirabika nga kya bulijjo.
Now he was alone.	Kati yali yekka.
Not my friend.	Si mukwano gwange.
You have a house.	Olina ennyumba.
As in the plural.	Nga bwe kiri mu bungi.
No one thinks it’s real.	Tewali alowooza nti ddala.
I know it will happen.	Nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
I was very unwell.	Nali nnyo siri bulungi.
This seems to be true.	Kino kirabika kituufu.
More than this.	Okusinga ku kino.
Something in him.	Ekintu mu ye.
However, that is not entirely the case.	Kyokka, ekyo si bwe kiri ddala.
That is the whole problem.	Ekyo kye kizibu kyonna.
This is really quite simple and easy.	Kino ddala kyangu nnyo era kyangu.
For anyone who wants to know.	Eri omuntu yenna ayagala okumanya.
It was there in everyone, he thought.	Kyali awo mu buli muntu, bwe yalowooza.
Although, it doesn’t matter.	Wadde, si kikulu.
I love being in the office.	Njagala nnyo okubeera mu ofiisi.
Perhaps you can do it.	Oboolyawo oyinza okukikola.
It’s not just that.	Si bwe kiri kyokka.
We were helpless.	Twali tetulina kye tusobola kukola.
That’s what we have.	Ekyo kye tulina.
It had to be someone he knew, or else he knew.	Yalina okuba omuntu gwe yali amanyi, oba si ekyo ye yali amanyi.
Everyone told me.	Buli omu yang’amba.
There’s certainly nothing wrong with that.	Mazima ddala tewali kibi kyonna mu ekyo.
Surely you are.	Mazima ddala ggwe oli.
I just want to be ready.	Nze njagala nnyo kubeera mwetegefu.
You can’t answer.	Tosobola kuddamu.
I'm beautiful.	Ndi mulungi.
I should know.	Nsaanidde okumanya.
It looks pretty good.	Kirabika kirungi nnyo.
I don’t know if you know.	Simanyi oba omanyi.
No one knows who it is.	Tewali amanyi ani.
How good you can be.	Nga osobola okuba omulungi ennyo.
He doesn't even really know.	Tamanyi wadde mu butuufu.
And it’s the job.	Era gwe mulimu.
That was at about three o'clock.	Ekyo kyali ku ssaawa nga ssatu.
You can see everything you want.	Osobola okulaba buli ky’oyagala.
He wasn’t good.	Yali si mulungi.
Mostly in the bedroom.	Okusinga mu kisenge.
But he couldn’t go.	Naye yali tasobola kugenda.
I will never do it again.	Sijja kuddamu kukikola.
However, this is a complex problem.	Kyokka, kino kizibu ekizibu ennyo.
That he was in danger.	Nti yali mu bulabe.
I can’t say too much.	Siyinza kwogera bingi nnyo.
He wants money.	Ayagala ssente.
It won’t help.	Tekijja kuyamba.
October went on.	October yagenda mu maaso.
You will go to school.	Ojja kugenda ku ssomero.
You don’t have a doctor.	Tolina musawo.
I love making these things.	Njagala nnyo okukola ebintu bino.
That’s the case here.	Ekyo bwe kiri wano.
He was like a father to me.	Yali nga taata gyendi.
I think positively and do positively.	Nze ndowooza bulungi era nkola bulungi.
This was a situation he didn’t want at all.	Eno yali mbeera gye yali tayagala n’akatono.
I do respond.	Nze nkola okuddamu.
He wanted there with her.	Yali ayagala awo naye.
He started in the front.	Yatandika mu maaso.
You know that now.	Ekyo okimanyi kati.
But whatever! 	Naye kyonna!
No, it’s very important.	Nedda, kikulu nnyo.
We don’t have the money.	Tetulina ssente.
I’ve always had that issue.	Bulijjo nfunye ensonga eyo.
Today, in fact.	Leero, mu butuufu.
We can’t do that.	Ekyo tetusobola kukikola.
You have to go to work tomorrow.	Olina okugenda ku mulimu enkya.
I wonder, of course.	Nneebuuza, ddala.
As early as it was.	Nga bukyali bwe kyali.
He has no knowledge at all.	Talina kumanya n’akatono.
He can’t believe it.	Tasobola kukkiriza.
It’s a very ordinary day.	Olunaku lwa bulijjo nnyo.
Not his friends.	Si mikwano gye.
I feel it now.	Mpulira kati.
And they are not, at all.	Era si bwe bali, n’akatono.
Where is he? 	Ali ludda wa?
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
And what a beautiful place it is.	Era nga kifo kirungi nnyo gye kiri.
I wanted to help.	Nnali njagala okuyamba.
It’s terrible, it’s terrible.	Kibi nnyo, kibi nnyo.
This may have been true.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga kyali kituufu.
And a great guy to work with.	Era ggaayi omulungi ennyo okukola naye.
She looks good.	Alabika bulungi.
But he was young.	Naye yali muto.
I was just something too.	Nange nnali kintu kyokka.
Up to the present time.	Okutuuka mu kiseera kino.
I had no interest in movies.	Nnali sirina kye njagala ku firimu.
It will be wonderful.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo.
This is in theory.	Kino kiri mu ndowooza.
That will be really bad.	Ekyo kijja kuba kibi ddala.
At the moment it is.	Mu kiseera kino bwe kiri.
Every child has one.	Buli mwana alina emu.
He was a good man.	Yali muntu mulungi.
Maybe he had a problem himself here.	Mpozzi nga ye kennyini yalina ekizibu wano.
It would be terrible.	Kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
Tom had his own car.	Tom yalina mmotoka ye.
You’re doing a pretty good job with these.	Okola omulimu mulungi nnyo ne bino.
And he didn’t want to know either.	Era naye yali tayagala kumanya.
But I was the only one.	Naye nnali nze nzekka.
It would be the weekend.	Kyandibadde wiikendi.
I feel so lucky.	Mpulira nga ndi wa mukisa nnyo.
Actually that’s not even close.	Mu butuufu ekyo si wadde kumpi.
He's at his girlfriend's.	Ali ku wa muganzi we.
He saw everything.	Yalaba buli kimu.
He wasn’t even going to try again.	Yali tagenda na kuddamu kugezaako.
He was only good for this.	Yali mulungi ku kino kyokka.
He’s not going to do it.	Tagenda kukikola.
Money isn’t everything.	Ssente si buli kimu.
You have a job.	Olina omulimu.
I’m not sure if it mattered.	Sikakasa oba kyali kikulu.
He wanted to know everything.	Yali ayagala okumanya buli kimu.
It won’t work.	Tekijja kukola.
It was just what we needed.	Kyali kye twali twetaaga kyokka.
It is indeed the case.	Ddala bwe kiri.
He loved to hit.	Yali ayagala nnyo okukuba.
But luckily for us, it’s not.	Naye omukisa gye tuli, si bwe kiri.
He really didn’t want to know.	Mu butuufu yali tayagala kumanya.
I hope you will be successful in doing so.	Nsuubira nti ojja kusobola bulungi okukikola.
He always lives in a house in the city.	Bulijjo abeera mu nnyumba emu mu kibuga.
Nothing is happening.	Tewali kigenda mu maaso.
He's not the one with the problem.	Si y'alina obuzibu.
I’m not at all sure he did.	Sikakasa n’akatono nti yakikola.
They were a city.	Baali kibuga.
But he was very sick.	Naye yali mulwadde nnyo.
I have no idea, really.	Sirina kirowoozo kyonna, ddala.
You are nothing to me.	Ggwe toli kintu kyonna gyendi.
Beautiful, actually.	Omulungi, mu butuufu.
I am so sorry about this.	Nsonyiwa nnyo ku nsonga eno.
He probably couldn’t believe it.	Oboolyawo yali tasobola kukkiriza.
And it is, of course.	Era bwe kiri, ddala.
We don’t have to deal with this.	Tetulina kukola ku nsonga eno.
He wanted to stay no.	Yali ayagala kusigala nga nedda.
But it probably will.	Naye oboolyawo kijja kubaawo.
Getting to this place is very difficult.	Okutuuka mu kifo kino kizibu nnyo.
Not bad, he thought.	Si kibi, bwe yalowooza.
Or to any of us.	Oba eri omuntu yenna ku ffe.
You have to turn that thing off.	Olina okuggyako ekintu ekyo.
She wanted to be in his house.	Yali ayagala kubeera mu nnyumba ye.
Not serious, of course.	Si kya maanyi, ddala.
The only thing is .	Ekintu kyokka kiri nti .
Apparently you know.	Kirabika omanyi.
Excited to see where this goes.	Musanyufu okulaba kino gye kigenda.
He must go home.	Ateekwa okudda eka.
And he does this thing .	Era ekintu kino akikola .
My friend is in trouble.	Mukwano gwange ali mu buzibu.
He is a character.	Ye muntu alina ekifaananyi.
Here alone.	Wano wekka.
It will always remain an idea for us.	Bulijjo kijja kusigala nga kirowoozo gye tuli.
Anything can come out of this.	Ekintu kyonna kiyinza okuva mu kino.
No one knows about this place.	Tewali amanyi ku kifo kino.
We don’t have a lot of money.	Tetulina ssente nnyingi.
You should have come with you.	Ggwe wandibadde ojja naawe.
We are very lucky.	Tuli ba mukisa nnyo.
I am nothing like you.	Nze siri kintu kyonna nga ggwe.
She needed to talk about it.	Yali yeetaaga okwogera ku nsonga eno.
I certainly hope you do this again.	Mazima ddala nsuubira nti kino ojja kuddamu okukikola.
He knew exactly what it was.	Yali amanyi bulungi kye kyali.
But it is very important.	Naye kikulu nnyo.
He can speak well.	Asobola bulungi okwogera.
He came up with nothing.	Yajja nga talina kintu kyonna.
It was like he was on her.	Yali nga bwe yali ku ye.
There is one there for you.	Waliwo emu eyo gy’oli.
He wants to be the best.	Ayagala kubeera asinga.
He got one.	Yafuna emu.
That’s a dangerous place to be.	Ekyo kifo kya bulabe okubeera.
He's much better off not being me.	Asinga nnyo okubeera nga si nze.
He wanted a chance to talk to her.	Yali ayagala omukisa okwogera naye.
It’s easy, but it’s not easy.	Kyangu, naye si kyangu.
He wants to talk to her.	Ayagala kwogera naye.
I couldn’t afford it.	Nnali sisobola kusobola.
It’s so bad.	Kibi nnyo.
I thought the movie was great.	Nalowooza nti firimu yali nnungi nnyo.
I just want to say.	Njagala kwogera kyokka.
You were alone.	Ggwe wali wekka.
He was strong.	Yali wa maanyi.
But maybe that’s the problem.	Naye mpozzi ekyo kye kizibu.
I don’t like this book.	Ekitabo kino sikyagala.
No such luck here though.	Tewali mukisa nga guno wano wadde.
I will do this.	Kino nja kukikola.
Excellent work here.	Omulimu mulungi nnyo wano.
But we’ll both move on.	Naye ffembi tujja kugenda mu maaso.
It was very nice and everyone was friendly.	Kyali kirungi nnyo era buli omu yali wa mukwano.
I love the picture in return.	Njagala nnyo ekifaananyi mu kuddamu.
He needed to find someone else.	Yali yeetaaga okufuna omuntu omulala.
That's my point though.	Eyo y'ensonga yange wadde.
But this isn’t that movie.	Naye eno si firimu eyo.
He won’t allow it to be the same.	Tajja kukkiriza kuba kye kimu.
He is always ready.	Bulijjo abeera mwetegefu.
And to you.	Era eri ggwe.
Very little indeed.	Katono nnyo ddala.
Maybe it was happening.	Mpozzi nga kyali kigenda mu maaso.
We don’t have that kind of relationship.	Tetulina mukwano gwa ngeri eyo.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
But, that was the only problem.	Naye, ekyo kye kyali ekizibu kyokka.
Everything was local.	Buli kimu kyali kya wano.
Not bad.	Si kibi.
And even as a child.	Era ne nga mwana muto.
This is really great.	Kino ddala kirungi nnyo.
But he thought so.	Naye yalowooza bw’atyo.
I am not an ordinary person.	Siri muntu wa bulijjo.
We are, too.	Naffe tuli.
That's where it all was.	Ekyo kyonna we kyali.
That would be .	Ekyo kyandibadde .
And now there’s this phone.	Era kati waliwo essimu eno.
But perhaps even .	Naye oboolyawo ne .
He said he had to do it.	Yagambye nti alina okukikola.
He would have loved it.	Yandibadde ayagala nnyo.
The job is the job.	Omulimu gwe mulimu.
But you are like me.	Naye ggwe oli nga nze.
Not a bad idea at all, actually.	Si kirowoozo kibi n’akatono, mu butuufu.
For that matter .	Ku nsonga eyo .
I feel ya.	Mpulira ya.
I want us to be together.	Njagala tuli wamu.
It was an office.	Yali ofiisi.
I will be ready.	Nja kuba mwetegefu.
You’re going to have to do it.	Ogenda kuba olina okukikola.
Everyone would do that.	Buli omu yandikoze bw’atyo.
You know the guy.	Omanyi ggaayi.
I hope you are very well.	Nsuubira nti oli bulungi nnyo.
Not in at the moment.	Si mu mu kiseera kino.
We have to answer!.	Tulina okuddamu!.
But that’s not what he said.	Naye ekyo si kye yayogera.
You have him all the time.	Olina ye buli kiseera.
And it isn’t.	Era si bwe kiri.
I am always here.	Bulijjo ndi wano.
We cannot know the whole situation.	Tetusobola kumanya mbeera yonna.
I was fine.	Nali bulungi.
I feel better too.	Nze nange mpulira bulungi.
It’s very important actually.	Kikulu nnyo mu butuufu.
I want another chance.	Njagala omukisa omulala.
He had no interest in any kind of relationship.	Yali talina ky’ayagala mu mukwano gwa ngeri yonna.
He probably would have.	Oboolyawo yandibadde.
Tom was asleep.	Tom yali yeebase.
But it’s not hard work.	Naye si mulimu gwa maanyi.
But that’s what it was.	Naye kye kyali.
We are, in many ways, just like you.	Naffe, mu ngeri nnyingi, tuli nga ggwe.
But it’s not very good.	Naye si kirungi nnyo.
We can already see that picture.	Tusobola dda okulaba ekifaananyi ekyo.
He will do it right.	Ajja kukikola bulungi.
How can you address this problem ?.	Oyinza otya okukola ku kizibu kino ?.
I don’t know how to do this without you.	Kino simanyi ngeri ki gye nnyinza kukikola nga tolina.
There and here.	Eyo ne wano.
He should have known.	Yandibadde amanyi.
He spoke much faster now.	Yayogera mangu nnyo kati.
But it’s something.	Naye kintu.
He was so unworthy.	Yali tasaanidde nnyo.
That’s the city.	Ekyo kye kibuga.
And so he agreed.	Era bwatyo bwe yakkiriza.
What we have to say about it.	Kye tulina okwogera ku nsonga eyo.
It’s very, very simple.	Kyangu nnyo nnyo.
That’s the point.	Eyo y’ensonga.
He was doing it.	Yali akikola.
I can get another job.	Nsobola okufuna omulimu omulala.
It’s really my friend.	Ddala mukwano gwange.
Maybe we were all me.	Mpozzi ffenna twali nze.
He felt a bit like that himself.	Ye kennyini yawulira katono bw’atyo.
We need to know why.	Tulina okumanya ensonga lwaki.
It's really bad.	Ddala kibi.
He didn’t want anyone to go with him.	Yali tayagala muntu yenna kugenda naye.
You have to do that.	Ekyo olina okukikola.
I wonder all about it.	Byonna nneebuuza.
I want to see a movie.	Njagala kulaba firimu.
It will be much better tomorrow.	Kijja kuba kirungi nnyo enkya.
It will go away every day.	Kijja kugenda buli lunaku.
But this is not the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri.
My father is coming.	Taata ajja.
he said, smirking.	bwe yagambye.
This is not very good.	Kino si kirungi nnyo.
I feel like I can definitely do it.	Mpulira nga nsobola bulungi okukikola.
I want it there.	Njagala awo.
I don’t know how or why.	Simanyi ngeri ki oba lwaki.
Right now, today.	Mu kiseera kino, leero.
You’ll be fine here.	Ojja kuba bulungi wano.
It will be better after he goes to school.	Kijja kuba kirungi nga amaze okugenda ku ssomero.
And we can do it too.	Era naffe tusobola okukikola.
You know my job.	Omanyi omulimu gwange.
No one knew the answer.	Tewali yali amanyi kya kuddamu.
Or you could be everyone else.	Oba oyinza okuba nga buli muntu omulala.
You are good to me.	Oli mulungi gyendi.
It was always the same.	Bulijjo kyali kye kimu.
Something he didn’t want to be.	Ekintu kye yali tayagala kubeera.
Maybe he always had.	Mpozzi bulijjo yalina.
And now in this way.	Era kati mu ngeri eno.
I'm not sure where where.	Sikakasa wa wa.
Surely, he could.	Ddala, yali asobola.
I have to see.	Nnina okulaba.
I was very young at the time.	Mu kiseera ekyo nnali muto nnyo.
That was the problem, obviously.	Ekyo kye kyali ekizibu, kya lwatu.
She is really doing well.	Ddala akola bulungi.
It’s all a matter of opinion.	Byonna nsonga ya ndowooza.
But now he is good.	Naye kati mulungi.
We have to be with him.	Tulina okuba naye.
But my friend	Naye mukwano gwange .
She loved her house.	Yali ayagala nnyo ennyumba ye.
It was a wonderful experience.	Kyali kirungi nnyo.
It was a force.	Yali maanyi.
He can’t exist without me.	Tasobola kubeerawo nga si nze.
And my father.	Ne taata wange.
This is a difficult one.	Kino kizibu.
I couldn’t see.	Nnali sisobola kulaba.
But it’s not just true.	Naye si kituufu kyokka.
He always had time for everyone.	Bulijjo yalina obudde eri buli muntu.
You can go home now.	Osobola okugenda awaka kati.
But we have no issue.	Naye tetulina nsonga yonna.
He was everything.	Yali buli kimu.
You have the whole morning.	Olina enkya yonna.
This is not the case.	Kino si bwe kiri.
You’re home now.	Oli waka kati.
That’s not true though.	Ekyo si kituufu wadde nga kituufu.
This is what he wants.	Kino ky’ayagala.
I hope you love being here.	Nsuubira nti oyagala nnyo okubeera wano.
More than this we cannot know.	Okusinga kino tetusobola kumanya.
For everyone, of course.	Ku buli muntu, ddala.
He shouldn’t do this.	Kino tasaanidde kukikola.
He can’t believe he’s not here.	Tayinza kukkiriza nti tali wano.
Everything was happening so fast.	Buli kimu kyali kigenda mu maaso mangu nnyo.
This is dangerous.	Kino kya bulabe.
You think it will be a great movie.	Olowooza ejja kuba firimu nnungi nnyo.
You don't want anything.	Tewali ky'oyagala.
Money, time, schedule.	Ssente, obudde, enteekateeka.
Not that it mattered at all.	Si nti kyali kikulu n’akatono.
You look so beautiful.	Olabika bulungi nnyo.
He beats being unemployed.	Akuba okubeera nga tolina mulimu.
I don’t care, really.	Nze sifaayo, ddala.
Everything is visible.	Buli kimu kirabika.
I love it here.	Njagala nnyo wano.
Not from the hospital.	Si okuva mu ddwaaliro.
That was a recovery.	Ekyo kyali kya kuddamu kubeera mu mbeera nnungi.
But we’re going to do it right now.	Naye tugenda kukikola mu kiseera kino.
And so far so good.	Era okutuuka kati kirungi nnyo.
And he knows.	Era amanyi.
This is very important.	Kino kikulu nnyo.
For what, he didn't quite know.	Ku lwa ki, yali tamanyi bulungi.
Or tried to do it.	Oba yagezaako okukikola.
I have to go now.	Nnina okugenda kati.
I certainly have.	Mazima ddala nnina.
Always was and always will be.	Bulijjo yali era bulijjo ajja kuba.
But one or the other is not.	Naye omu oba omulala si bwe kiri.
I have to be.	Nnina okubeera.
It’s not true at all.	Si kituufu n’akatono.
Or it could be mine.	Oba kiyinza okuba nga kyange.
And he’s not the only one.	Era si ye yekka.
I was the one who was me.	Nze nali nze.
And that was easy.	Era ekyo kyali kyangu.
But it looked great.	Naye nga kirabika kirungi nnyo.
Not only isn’t it, but it isn’t.	Si kyokka nti si bwe kiri, naye si bwe kiri.
Both are fine with me.	Bombi bali bulungi gyendi.
Thinking is more important than knowing.	Okulowooza kikulu nnyo okusinga okumanya.
Now it’s not a bad thing.	Kati si kibi.
He was already on her.	Yali dda ku ye.
This was on him now.	Kino kyali ku ye kati.
He's both both.	Ye bombi bombi.
What he had a job to do.	Kye yali alina omulimu gwe yakola.
And well it might.	Era bulungi kiyinza.
He had to do it.	Yalina okukikola.
Not even his brother.	Si wadde muganda we.
I couldn’t go on without his help.	Nnali sisobola kugenda mu maaso nga sirina buyambi bwe.
He was talking about me.	Yali ayogera ku nze.
It certainly had.	Mazima ddala kyalina.
He rings in the clock.	Akuba mu ssaawa.
I'll go alone.	Nja kugenda nzekka.
He didn’t want to.	Yali tayagala.
Someone knew why, of course.	Omuntu yali amanyi lwaki, ddala.
It was actually quite good.	Mu butuufu kyali kirungi nnyo.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	Nja kwogera naawe enkya.
Probably nothing good.	Oboolyawo tewali kirungi kyonna.
It was somewhere.	Kyali waliwo we kyali.
But you don’t know.	Naye ggwe tomanyi.
This is not true.	Kino si kituufu.
And it was beautiful.	Era yali nnungi.
What should we do?.	Tulina kukola ki?.
No one should have to do it alone.	Tewali muntu yenna yandibadde alina kukikola yekka.
This is what is happening here.	Kino kye kiri wano.
He knew he was going to do that.	Yali akimanyi nti ekyo yali agenda kukikola.
He will always be with me.	Ajja kubeera nange bulijjo.
And there is a reason to go.	Era waliwo ensonga lwaki ogenda.
Maybe she’s not actually my boyfriend .	Mpozzi mu butuufu si ye muganzi wange .
He is at home, and trying to get a job.	Ali waka, era agezaako okufuna omulimu.
He should have been good, but he wasn't.	Yandibadde mulungi naye nga si bwe yali.
He wasn't supposed to be here.	Yali talina kubeera wano.
That’s all he did.	Ekyo kyokka kye yakola.
There is a good chance that this will happen.	Waliwo omukisa omulungi nti kino kijja kubaawo.
I think it might be.	Ndowooza kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
And she was pretty, she thought.	Era yali mulungi nnyo, bwe yalowooza.
And then we’ll be fine.	Era awo tujja kuba bulungi.
I was so in love with it.	Nnali njagala nnyo.
And it was safe.	Era nga tewali bulabe.
He thought he had.	Yalowooza nti yalina.
He was here, and very close.	Yali wano, era kumpi nnyo.
You can’t come with me.	Tosobola kujja nange.
I couldn’t have done it myself.	Nze kennyini nnali siyinza kukikola.
It doesn’t matter.	Si nsonga.
However, it is not serious.	Kyokka, si kya maanyi.
That wasn’t his reasoning.	Ekyo si kye kyali ensonga ze.
Not in this.	Si mu kino.
Soon he didn't know where anything was.	Mu bbanga ttono yali tamanyi kintu kyonna we kyali.
Everyone needed to go somewhere.	Buli omu yalina we yali yeetaaga okugenda.
I know it well enough.	Nze nkimanyi bulungi.
She was a beautiful woman.	Yali mukyala mulungi.
What is that? 	Ekyo kye ki?
There is nothing to say.	Tewali kya kwogera.
We are always in danger.	Bulijjo tuli mu bulabe.
That’s not like him.	Ekyo si nga ye.
You want to be alone.	Oyagala kubeera wekka.
And all of that.	Era ebyo byonna.
Better than it looks.	Kirungi okusinga bwe kirabika.
It's not you.	Si ggwe.
I am not one for anyone.	Siri omu ku muntu yenna.
However, it doesn’t seem to be very good.	Kyokka, kirabika si kirungi nnyo.
It doesn’t come.	Tekijja.
I can’t do this.	Kino sisobola kukikola.
He probably tried to do too much too soon.	Oboolyawo yagezaako okukola bingi nnyo amangu ddala.
I really need some time to think.	Nze ddala nneetaaga akaseera okulowooza.
It is very, very, very bad.	Kibi nnyo nnyo nnyo.
And he did it very well.	Era yakikola bulungi nnyo.
However, it would be worse.	Kyokka, kyandibadde kibi nnyo.
It will work, one person at a time.	Kijja kukola, omuntu omu ku omu.
This is very dangerous right now.	Kino kya bulabe nnyo mu kiseera kino.
I don’t know who it is.	Simanyi ani.
And then it appeared.	Era awo ne kirabika.
But it’s so easy.	Naye nga kyangu nnyo.
I knew it would happen.	Nali nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo.
It’s what he is.	Kye ky’ali.
We are moving forward.	Tugenda mu maaso.
I am an only child.	Nze ndi mwana omu yekka.
It was a very dangerous plan.	Yali nteekateeka ya bulabe nnyo.
I will definitely do this again!!!.	Kino nja kuddamu okukola ddala!!!.
With a point, though.	Nga tulina ensonga, wadde.
What's up everyone.	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso buli omu.
But he didn’t have to.	Naye yali talina kukikola.
You’re not as young as you used to be.	Toli muto nga bwe wali.
He knew he didn’t have much time.	Yali akimanyi nti talina budde bungi.
He is not seriously ill.	Si mulwadde wa maanyi.
In fact, he already has.	Mu butuufu, yalina dda.
My wife too.	Mukyala wange naye.
And he looks like nothing.	Era alabika nga talina kintu kyonna.
We need to know.	Tulina okumanya.
I want you too.	Naawe njagala.
The thing is not the same.	Ekintu si kye kimu.
They were both at the time.	Bombi baali mu kiseera ekyo.
No one but you.	Tewali muntu yenna okuggyako ggwe.
This just isn’t the case.	Kino kyokka si bwe kiri.
I need help.	Nneetaaga obuyambi.
You are on your own.	Oli ku ggwe wekka.
He knew he had a problem.	Yali akimanyi nti alina ekizibu.
Back to work!.	Okudda ku mulimu!.
She loved everything.	Yali ayagala nnyo buli kimu.
She was so young and so beautiful.	Yali muto nnyo era nga mulungi nnyo.
I am currently working.	Mu kiseera kino nkola.
But, honestly, it was bad.	Naye, mu butuufu, kyali kibi.
Blunt .	Si wa .
I love it and am ready to go.	Njagala nnyo era ndi mwetegefu okugenda.
However, this was urgent.	Kyokka kino kyali kya mangu.
But always happy.	Naye bulijjo nga musanyufu.
I was too scared to do anything.	Nnali ntya nnyo nga sisobola kukola kintu kyonna.
But it’s there.	Naye kiri awo.
That doesn’t matter though.	Ekyo si kikulu wadde.
I think he was in his room.	Ndowooza yali mu kisenge kye.
Maybe we should back off a bit.	Mpozzi tusaanidde okudda emabega katono.
He doesn’t deserve this at all.	Kino tasaanidde n’akatono.
I hope that comes soon.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kijja mu bbanga ttono.
They were very close, of course.	Baali kumpi nnyo, ddala.
He told me you were here.	Yangamba nti oli wano.
And so would my friend.	Era ne mukwano gwange bwe yandikoze.
That would be something, anyway.	Ekyo kyandibadde kintu, mu ngeri yonna.
He must move forward.	Ateekwa okugenda mu maaso.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
Almost one in three.	Kumpi emu ku ssatu.
I want to do this.	Kino njagala kukikola.
However, I couldn’t do it.	Kyokka nnali sisobola kukikola.
Why is that difficult.	Lwaki ekyo kizibu.
I will do that.	Ekyo nja kukikola.
And for a while, that was it.	Era okumala akaseera, ekyo kye kyali.
I am also not a good person.	Nze era siri muntu mulungi.
He loved being with her.	Yali ayagala nnyo okubeera naye.
Why, they are .	Lwaki, bali .
Something is going on back there.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso emabega awo.
Everyone, except you.	Buli muntu, okuggyako ggwe.
I certainly know that is not the case.	Mazima ddala nkimanyi nti ekyo si bwe kiri.
And this is true.	Era kino kituufu.
It's down below.	Kiri wansi wansi.
He wanted to be me.	Yali ayagala kubeera nze.
And that’s not good.	Era ekyo si kirungi.
He was willing.	Yali ayagala.
Not much but not a problem.	Si bingi naye si kizibu.
But that’s it, just the two of us.	Naye ekyo kye kiri, ffembi ffekka.
It’s really great to see.	Ddala kirungi nnyo okulaba.
It will come back.	Kijja kudda.
And none of this is easy.	Era tewali na kimu ku bino kyangu.
Not everyone came to the party.	Si buli muntu nti yajja ku mbaga.
He had, to get home.	Yalina, okutuuka awaka.
Mostly, it was my problem.	Okusinga, kyali kizibu kyange.
I was there myself.	Nze kennyini nnali awo.
He was terrified.	Yali atya nnyo.
That’s my son.	Oyo ye mwana wange.
Let him do whatever he wanted.	Akole kyonna kye yali ayagala.
I know we were.	Nkimanyi nti twali.
You never know what’s going to happen.	Tomanyi kigenda kubaawo.
Good but difficult.	Kirungi naye nga kizibu.
He is beautiful .	Ye mulungi .
I won’t know.	Sijja kumanya.
He was finished.	Yali amaze.
We already have a lot.	Tulina dda bingi.
No time for that.	Tewali budde bwa ekyo.
But he can’t.	Naye tasobola.
That was pretty close.	Eyo yali nnungi nnyo kumpi.
He was very happy.	Yali musanyufu nnyo.
No, you won’t.	Nedda, tojja kukikola.
He expects to do well.	Asuubira okukola obulungi.
We have to get back to winning.	Tulina okudda mu kuwangula.
He was a child in his time.	Yali mwana mu kiseera kye.
He was a very dangerous man at that time.	Yali musajja wa bulabe nnyo mu kiseera ekyo.
You’re not here.	Ggwe toli wano.
There is much we can do together.	Waliwo bingi bye tusobola okukola ffenna.
And yes, she is his friend.	Era ye, ye mukwano gwe.
He had to get out of there.	Yalina okuva awo.
He was fine.	Yali bulungi.
Hope, he thought.	Essuubi, bwe yalowooza.
What a wonderful idea.	Nga kirowoozo kirungi nnyo.
He has to do it.	Alina okukikola.
So far there is no single problem.	N’okutuusa kati tewali kizibu kimu.
He does a job here and there.	Akola omulimu wano ne wali.
A little bit here.	Katono wano.
But of course, he was.	Naye kya lwatu, bwe yali.
I am his friend.	Nze mukwano gwe.
You’ll be fine.	Ojja kuba bulungi.
It’s hard for me to say.	Kizibu gyendi okwogera.
He couldn’t see anything.	Yali tasobola kulaba kintu kyonna.
But you couldn’t tell, of course.	Naye nga tosobola kumanya, ddala.
I need an hour.	Nze nneetaaga essaawa emu.
The problem is the opportunity.	Obuzibu gwe mukisa.
But he's still as good as ever.	Naye akyali mulungi nga bulijjo.
Every response is enough.	Buli kuddamu kumala.
I want to be with him.	Njagala kubeera naye.
Now it looks good.	Kati kirabika kirungi.
He was still a man.	Yali akyali musajja.
You will have to act like I am not today.	Ojja kuba olina okukola nga si nze leero.
He could .	Yali asobola .
There is no time like now.	Tewali budde nga kati.
She was so good, she was almost beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo, kumpi yali mulungi.
Just a moment ago.	Akaseera katono ddala emabega.
You were the one before.	Ggwe gwe wali emabegako.
I think that would be good for us.	Ndowooza ekyo kyandibadde kirungi gye tuli.
Perhaps that is the crux of the problem.	Mpozzi ekyo kye kikulu ennyo mu buzibu.
I have it now.	Nnina kati.
And that’s not the only problem.	Era ekyo si kye kyokka ekizibu.
I wonder what he was thinking.	Nze nneebuuza kye yali alowooza.
However, it is not us.	Kyokka si ffe.
It is certainly close.	Mazima ddala kiri kumpi.
But not at home.	Naye si waka.
But he was there.	Naye yali awo.
He felt he had to leave.	Yawulira nti alina okuva awo.
No man can.	Tewali musajja asobola.
No, it’s not helpful.	Nedda, si kuyamba.
Stuff though, really stuff.	Ebintu wadde, ddala ebintu.
That’s what we need to do.	Ekyo kye twetaaga okukola.
It can be a bad thing.	Kiyinza okuba nga kibi.
I’m the way it is.	Nze bwe kiri.
I’m really scared.	Nze ddala ntya.
And that’s very difficult.	Era ekyo kizibu nnyo.
When he knew it.	Nga akimanyi.
But you would .	Naye ggwe wandibadde .
If that was the case.	Singa ekyo kye kyali.
No one will come.	Tewali ajja kujja.
He just couldn’t.	Ye yekka yali tasobola.
In but now.	Mu naye kati.
I know that’s not the truth.	Nkimanyi nti ekyo si kye kituufu.
I don't want anything on.	Sirina kye njagala ku.
In practice, it looks great.	Mu nkola, kirabika bulungi nnyo.
Everyone is good.	Buli muntu mulungi.
We don’t have that attitude.	Tetulina ndowooza eyo.
That is absolutely true.	Ekyo kituufu ddala.
But not just now.	Naye si kati kyokka.
It was so easy.	Kyali kyangu nnyo.
I am also very sorry.	Nze nange nsonyiwa nnyo.
But honestly, it was pretty simple.	Naye mu butuufu, kyali kyangu nnyo.
But yes, he is here.	Naye ye, ali wano.
He seems like a very nice man.	Alabika nga musajja mulungi nnyo.
I’ll talk to the actress.	Nja kwogera ne muzannyi wa firimu.
Maybe everyone is.	Mpozzi buli muntu bw’atyo.
All I know is .	Nze kye mmanyi kyokka .
I can’t do that.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola.
Must be there early today.	Alina okubaawo nga bukyali leero.
That’s actually pretty easy to do.	Ekyo mu butuufu kyangu nnyo okukola.
But he’s always curious.	Naye bulijjo ayagala okumanya.
We probably all have.	Oboolyawo ffenna tulina.
I hear about this .	Mpulira ku kino .
This is my place, no where.	Kino kye kifo kyange, tewali we.
It had to get out of here.	Kyalina okuva wano.
Actually anything with him.	Mu butuufu ekintu kyonna naye.
The phone started ringing.	Essimu yatandika okukuba.
But it’s very difficult.	Naye nga kizibu nnyo.
It would have been nice if he had.	Kyandibadde kirungi singa yakikola.
I have it every morning.	Nnina buli ku makya.
I have more to do.	Nnina okusinga okukola.
That is certainly good.	Mazima ekyo kirungi.
He’s going to do it.	Agenda kukikola.
I am so alone.	Nze ndi nzekka nnyo.
It would be soon now.	Kyandibadde mu bbanga ttono kati.
He doesn’t know, yet.	Tamanyi, n’okutuusa kati.
But we have another job.	Naye tulina omulimu omulala.
That is why he is here.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki ali wano.
Then one night .	Awo ekiro kimu .
He knew he would be there.	Yali akimanyi nti ajja kubeerawo.
You will have to think fast.	Ojja kuba olina okulowooza amangu.
Only he had to know.	Ye yekka ye yalina okumanya.
You are just a human being.	Oli muntu yekka.
You’re in the hospital.	Oli mu ddwaaliro.
He still didn’t even have a car.	Yali n’okutuusa kati yali talina mmotoka wadde.
He said he would be fine.	Yagambye nti ajja kuba bulungi.
He said no way, absolutely not.	Yagamba nti tewali ngeri yonna, nedda ddala.
One a day.	Omu olunaku.
If anything is going to happen it would be now.	Singa waliwo ekigenda okubaawo kyandibadde kati.
I’m sorry about your car.	Nsonyiwa ku mmotoka yo.
For another child.	Ku mwana omulala.
This thing continues to be important.	Ekintu kino kigenda mu maaso nga kikulu.
You have a little time.	Olina akaseera katono.
Everyone here is nice.	Buli muntu wano mulungi.
I guess it’s true.	Ntebereza nti kituufu.
This was now going to happen.	Kino kati kyali kigenda kubaawo.
This was normal.	Kino kyali kya bulijjo.
But the phone would work just fine.	Naye essimu yandikoze bulungi nnyo.
How can I do it.	Nnyinza ntya okukikola.
In a sense, though, that’s the point.	Kyokka mu ngeri emu, eyo y’ensonga.
But they are fine.	Naye bali bulungi.
That’s all anyone needs to know.	Ekyo kyokka omuntu yenna ky’alina okumanya.
You really really shouldn’t.	Ddala ddala tolina kukikola.
No, not for the money.	Nedda, si lwa ssente.
We can’t talk here, we have to talk.	Tetusobola kwogera wano, tulina okwogera.
I want you to love it.	Njagala oyagala nnyo.
I really love movies.	Nze ddala njagala nnyo firimu.
Everyone has their own opinion.	Buli muntu alina endowooza ye.
He could easily say no.	Yali asobola bulungi okugamba nti nedda.
That will be normal.	Ekyo kijja kuba kya bulijjo.
All week, barely able to speak.	Wiiki yonna, nga tasobola kwogera bulungi.
He hopes not.	Asuubira nti si bwe kiri.
But for a little while.	Naye okumala akaseera katono.
But he wants to try.	Naye ayagala kugezaako.
I'm not the one.	Si nze ye.
Not much though.	Si bingi wadde.
It’s his idea.	Kye kirowoozo kye.
But only as a friend.	Naye nga mukwano gwe yekka.
Only that he wants to talk to you.	Kyokka nti ayagala okwogera naawe.
You are not alone.	Toli wekka.
Now he was speaking.	Kati yali ayogera.
You could buy a house with almost no money down.	Oyinza okugula ennyumba nga kumpi tewali ssente wansi.
However, such a thing is hard to find.	Kyokka, kizibu okufuna ekintu ng’ekyo.
He would have loved it as much as anything.	Yandibadde ayagala nga ekintu kyonna.
He has been curious about this for a long time.	Abadde ayagala okumanya ku nsonga eno okumala ebbanga.
And it’s going to stay with me.	Era kigenda kusigala nange.
But you don’t have to stay.	Naye tolina kusigala.
We’re not going to do anything now.	Tetulina kye tugenda kukola kati.
In fact, there is only one other in prison right now.	Mu butuufu, mu kiseera kino waliwo omulala omu yekka ali mu kkomera.
A lot of that.	Bingi ku ebyo.
And of course this was true.	Era mazima kino kyali kituufu.
I think this is very, very important.	Ndowooza kino kikulu nnyo nnyo.
It’s not like it was just us.	Si nga bwe kyali ffe ffekka.
As you said yourself.	Nga ggwe kennyini bwe wagamba.
I knew it, too.	Nange nnali nkimanyi.
And he is very beautiful.	Era mulungi nnyo.
Now, it’s not coming at all.	Kati, si kijja n’akatono.
Everything was in abundance.	Buli kimu kyali mu bungi.
Speaking a little easier.	Okwogera nga kyangu katono.
My father had nothing.	Taata yali talina ky’alina.
He couldn’t believe what he saw.	Yali tasobola kukkiriza bye yalaba.
This is why this .	Eno y'ensonga lwaki kino .
On his car.	Ku mmotoka ye.
It was his idea, he thought.	Yali ndowooza ye, bwe yalowooza.
He was in his house.	Yali mu nnyumba ye.
However, this is not always the case.	Kyokka, kino si bwe kiri bulijjo.
Or anytime actually.	Oba essaawa yonna mu butuufu.
He must be a great guy.	Ateekwa okuba nga ggaayi nnyo.
But now he was here.	Naye kati yali wano.
He didn’t have a good one.	Yali talina mulungi.
This is really powerful.	Kino ddala kya maanyi.
We are lucky to have you here.	Tulina omukisa okubeera naawe wano.
I’m very willing.	Nze ndi mwetegefu nnyo.
Back to us.	Okudda gye tuli.
Only one child.	Mwana omu yekka.
But we should be moving forward.	Naye tusaanidde okuba nga tugenda mu maaso.
He is in excellent condition.	Ali mu mbeera nnungi nnyo.
I am an ordinary person.	Ndi muntu wa bulijjo.
You can probably win.	Oboolyawo osobola okuwangula.
Great, he thought.	Kikulu, bwe yalowooza.
He speaks really well.	Ayogera bulungi ddala.
But that’s just fine with me.	Naye ekyo kirungi nnyo gyendi.
I didn’t know why.	Nnali simanyi lwaki.
I’m just not like that.	Nze si bwe kiri kyokka.
Now you are my wife.	Kati oli mukyala wange.
Or he would have.	Oba yandibadde.
He knew she looked great.	Yali akimanyi nti alabika bulungi nnyo.
Probably, probably not.	Oboolyawo, oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
But it’s what he wants.	Naye ye ky’ayagala.
And that’s the real problem.	Era ekyo kye kizibu ennyo.
Obviously, this is a dangerous idea.	Kya lwatu nti kino ndowooza ya bulabe.
Maybe he was, maybe not.	Mpozzi nga yali, mpozzi si bwe kiri.
You are not and should not.	Ggwe toli era tolina.
I won’t go to school.	Sijja kugenda ku ssomero.
That picture was beautiful.	Ekifaananyi ekyo kyali kirungi nnyo.
And above all that.	Era okusinga ebyo byonna.
Of course, he was nobody.	Kya lwatu nti yali si muntu yenna.
It won’t and never will.	Tekijja kubaawo era tekijja kubaawo.
He is not about that.	Tali ku nsonga eyo.
He did it anyway.	Yakikola mu ngeri yonna.
But it’s not us.	Naye si ffe.
He talks for a long time.	Ayogera okumala ebbanga ddene.
You have to work .	Olina okukola .
He’s going to do it.	Agenda kukikola.
Everyone should also speak in return.	Buli omu era alina okwogera mu kuddamu.
Maybe it was the police.	Mpozzi nga poliisi ye yali.
I’ll do anything, anything .	Nja kukola kyonna, ekintu kyonna .
It’s very, very good.	Kirungi nnyo nnyo.
You don’t have to, and you do.	Tolina, era olina.
No, I don't know.	Nedda simanyi.
I will be thinking of you.	Nja kuba ndowooza ku ggwe.
And you never know exactly when something might happen.	Era tomanyi bulungi ddi ekintu lwe kiyinza okubaawo.
You look good tonight.	Olabika bulungi ekiro kino.
I’m not sure it’s human.	Sikakasa nti muntu.
That’s how he made his money.	Bwatyo bwe yakola ssente ze.
I love both of them.	Njagala nnyo bombi.
He wants to spend time with us.	Ayagala okumala naffe obudde.
And maybe he would.	Era mpozzi yandikoze.
That’s all he saw.	Ekyo kyokka kye yalaba.
You can see clearly in the room.	Osobola okulaba obulungi mu kisenge.
And it’s mine.	Nange kyange.
Just like in the movie, he said nothing.	Nga bwe kyali mu firimu, tewali kye yayogera.
But it will likely come soon.	Naye kirabika kijja kujja mangu.
That was a very difficult one.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo.
He cannot deal with faith.	Tasobola kukola ku kukkiriza.
And then we’re going to drive.	Era awo tugenda kuvuga.
In fact, he was powerful.	Mu butuufu, yali alina amaanyi.
Can someone see my point.	Waliwo asobola okulaba ensonga yange.
But most of all he loves to read.	Naye okusinga byonna ayagala nnyo okusoma.
Or you can’t.	Oba tosobola.
But not for the reason he thought.	Naye si lwa nsonga gye yalowooza.
I feel like I’m sick.	Mpulira nga ndi mulwadde.
. . . .	.
But he was afraid too.	Naye naye yali atya.
Now, it’s time to get back to work.	Kati, kye kiseera okudda ku mulimu.
You're fine, baby.	Oli bulungi mwana wange.
And you, too, well .	Era naawe, bulungi .
That book is very difficult.	Ekitabo ekyo kizibu nnyo.
It doesn’t really matter.	Si kikulu nnyo.
It was the same thing.	Kyali kintu kye kimu.
I love it so much.	Njagala nnyo.
By now, he knew a lot.	Mu kiseera kino, yali amanyi ebintu bingi.
We have to do that too.	Ekyo naffe tulina okukikola.
It was there in himself.	Kyali awo mu ye kennyini.
Here we have one, here one, and here.	Wano tulina emu, wano emu, ne wano.
This probably won’t happen any time soon.	Kino osanga tekijja kubaawo mu bbanga ttono.
And I wanted to do it.	Era nnali njagala okukikola.
I don’t like it.	Sikyagala.
I really like that one.	Njagala nnyo eyo.
However, I am not sure.	Kyokka, sikakasa.
It would be wonderful.	Kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
You can’t tell.	Tosobola kumanya.
Everything seems completely unreal.	Buli kimu kirabika nga si kya ddala ddala.
He could have said no.	Yali asobola okugamba nti nedda.
I am a beautiful woman.	Ndi mukyala mulungi.
For the money.	Ku ssente.
The arrangement worked very well.	Enteekateeka yakola bulungi nnyo.
I won’t do such a thing here.	Sijja kukola kintu ng’ekyo wano.
I could have gone to jail.	Nnali nsobola okugenda mu kkomera.
Here there, everywhere.	Wano awo, buli wamu.
He wanted to make friends with her.	Yali ayagala kukola mukwano naye.
We were friends.	Twali ba mukwano.
Honestly, I didn’t have any.	Mu butuufu, nnali sirina.
We cannot allow that to happen.	Tetusobola kukkiriza ekyo kubaawo.
It’s not help.	Si buyambi.
And in a very short time.	Era mu bbanga ttono ddala.
But that’s certainly easier said than done.	Naye ekyo mazima ddala kyangu okwogera.
I hope they are.	Nsuubira nti bwe bali.
No one speaks in this place.	Tewali ayogera mu kifo kino.
You know this stuff better than I do.	Ekintu kino okimanyi okusinga nze.
The point is, he does.	Ensonga eri nti, akikola.
What was it that was.	Kiki kye kyali.
I don’t want to go either.	Nange saagala kugenda.
Nothing of the sort, and all that.	Tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo, era ebyo byonna.
And he wanted to go.	Era yali ayagala kugenda.
But you won't.	Naye tojja ku.
Everyone is very friendly.	Buli muntu wa mukwano nnyo.
But you can’t do it.	Naye tosobola kukikola.
That is a very difficult thing.	Ekyo kintu kizibu nnyo.
However, this	Naye, kino .
He is lucky.	Alina omukisa.
I'll work on him.	Nja kukola ku ye.
You are a good father.	Oli taata mulungi.
Perhaps he was, or perhaps she .	Oboolyawo ye yali, oba oboolyawo ye .
He must be sick.	Ateekwa okuba nga mulwadde.
Not really, really.	Si ddala, ddala.
It’s really important to get back to work.	Ddala kikulu okuddamu okukola.
My wife said no.	Mukyala wange yagamba nti nedda.
It'll be good for you, you'll see.	Kijja kuba kirungi gy'oli, ojja kulaba.
He felt like he was really .	Yawulira nga ddala .
I have the power.	Nnina amaanyi.
That might just work.	Ekyo kiyinza okukola kyokka.
It’s very nice.	Kirungi nnyo.
The problem is wanting to do something like this.	Obuzibu buli ku kwagala okukola ekintu nga kino.
But that doesn’t matter.	Naye ekyo si kikulu.
I have no idea what it is, or if anything is going to happen.	Sirina kirowoozo ku kiki, oba waliwo ekigenda okubaawo.
In for a penny.	Mu ku ssente emu.
Nothing .	Tewali .
But now he wanted to know.	Naye kati yali ayagala okumanya.
He is a strong man.	Ye musajja wa maanyi.
I have nothing to fear.	Nze sirina kye ntya.
I’m thinking about him.	Nze ndowooza ku ye.
It was close to home.	Yali kumpi awaka.
Not even in the clock.	Si wadde mu ssaawa.
Now step back .	Kati dda emabega .
He thought he had nothing but this he had.	Yalowooza nti talina ky’alina naye kino yalina.
I am very, very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo nnyo.
This is nothing.	Kino si kintu kyonna.
Pretty good, maybe.	Kirungi nnyo, mpozzi.
I didn’t want to come.	Nnali saagala kujja.
We’re going to help.	Tugenda kuyamba.
It was a prison.	Yali kkomera.
He was working.	Yali akola.
He probably knew it at the time.	Oboolyawo yali akimanyi mu kiseera ekyo.
You have a lot.	Olina bingi.
I was a week early.	Nnali nga bukyali wiiki emu.
I probably have.	Oboolyawo nnina.
But this is what it really was.	Naye kino kye kyali ddala.
He is there now.	Ali awo kati.
He knew exactly what she was thinking.	Yali amanyi bulungi kye yali alowooza.
He wants a reason.	Ayagala ensonga.
No, that is not true.	Nedda, ekyo si kituufu.
I just want .	Nze njagala kyokka .
Very easy, right?.	Kyangu nnyo, nedda?.
And he still looks very sick, too.	Era alabika akyali mulwadde nnyo, naye.
But this is not always the case.	Naye kino si bwe kiri bulijjo.
Doing whatever you want.	Okukola kyonna ky’oyagala.
I work in this situation myself.	Nze kennyini nkola mu mbeera eno.
I don’t know what to say.	Simanyi kya kwogera.
They were normal though.	Baali ba bulijjo wadde.
Not much, though.	Kyokka si bingi.
He is a human being like everyone else.	Ye muntu nga buli muntu omulala.
He is a beautiful thing.	Ye kintu kirungi nnyo.
I genuinely want to know.	Nze mu butuufu njagala okumanya.
He was another man.	Yali musajja omulala.
He had to think fast.	Yalina okulowooza amangu.
And yes, there is a picture.	Era ye, waliwo ekifaananyi.
Not a real problem, really.	Si kizibu kya ddala, ddala.
He needs help seeing.	Yeetaaga obuyambi okulaba.
This is a simple problem.	Kino kizibu kyangu.
As he should have been.	Nga bwe yandibadde.
I won’t stay long.	Sijja kumala bbanga ddene.
I won’t want to go.	Sijja kwagala kugenda.
I'll move on.	Nja kugenda mu maaso.
But it will come.	Naye kijja kujja.
And now he couldn’t.	Era kati yali tasobola.
You have it, too.	Naawe olina.
There is no help.	Tewali buyambi.
It doesn’t matter which side they are on.	Si kikulu nti bali ku ludda ki.
It was very powerful.	Yali ya maanyi nnyo.
I definitely plan on doing it.	Mazima ddala nteekateeka okukikola.
They were in	Baali mu .
I loved this job.	Omulimu guno nnali njagala nnyo.
However, I couldn’t.	Kyokka nnali sisobola.
It was just an idea.	Kyali kirowoozo kyokka.
But he got what he wanted.	Naye yafuna kye yali ayagala.
That's good.	Ekyo kirungi.
I think he would be good for you.	Ndowooza yandibadde mulungi gy’oli.
This or that.	Kino oba ekyo.
Now we will talk more.	Kati tujja kwogera nnyo.
One can be .	Omuntu asobola okuba .
This is what really matters.	Kino kye kikulu ennyo.
He wants to be the best.	Ayagala kubeera asinga.
That was good for me.	Ekyo kyali kirungi gyendi.
And this is what it is.	Era kino kye kiri.
We are getting better and better.	Tugenda tugenda bulungi.
In reality, though, there is nothing to be done.	Kyokka mu butuufu, tewali kya kukola.
Everyone has to answer to someone.	Buli omu alina okuddamu omuntu.
This book is powerful.	Ekitabo kino kya maanyi nnyo.
I will come back to this below.	Nja kudda ku kino wansi.
Very good so far.	Kirungi nnyo okutuusa kati.
I don’t want to be a doctor.	Saagala kubeera musawo.
I know what he wants.	Nze mmanyi ky’ayagala.
So he did it.	Bwatyo bwe yakola.
It was a terrible time for me.	Kyali kiseera kibi nnyo gyendi.
I need your help as well.	Nneetaaga obuyambi ggwe era.
In fact, my father had.	Mu butuufu taata yalina.
I have to talk to him now'.	Nnina okwogera naye kati'.
It was what it was.	Kyali kye kyali.
I don’t want to go with him.	Saagala kugenda naye.
This is one of those.	Kino kye kimu ku ebyo.
It was a very important one.	Kyali kikulu nnyo.
I can do this too.	Kino nange nsobola okukikola.
It was very powerful.	Kyali kya maanyi nnyo.
I'm going to go.	Ngenda kugenda.
This was good at this.	Kino yali mulungi mu kino.
I don’t even know where.	Simanyi na wa.
And he didn’t want to try.	Era yali tayagala kugezaako.
In fact, it’s much lower.	Mu butuufu, kiri wansi nnyo.
He would love that.	Ekyo yandiyagadde nnyo.
And he thinks.	Era alowooza.
Here and there.	Wano ne wali.
No one has any idea why.	Tewali alina kirowoozo kyonna ku nsonga lwaki.
He was very ordinary.	Yali wa bulijjo nnyo.
Now you know everything.	Kati buli kimu okimanyi.
He must be asleep already.	Ateekwa okuba nga yeebase dda.
But every morning.	Naye buli ku makya.
This was both true and untrue.	Kino kyali kituufu era nga si kituufu.
How lucky we are, indeed.	Nga tuli ba mukisa, ddala.
He was suddenly alone.	Yali yekka mu bwangu.
I’m feeling a bit out of place right now.	Mpulira nga nfunye akaseera katono mu kiseera kino.
And herein lies the problem.	Era wano we wali ekizibu.
I should have gone now.	Nze wandibadde ngenda kati.
Everything will be fine.	Buli kimu kijja kuba kirungi.
One problem with this one.	Ekizibu kimu ne kino.
The person admitted that he was.	Omuntu oyo yakkiriza nti yali.
I’m not sure what that would be.	Sikakasa ekyo kye kyandibadde.
No one was home.	Tewali yali awaka.
And they were into everything.	Era baali mu buli kimu.
Now that's the thing.	Kati ekyo kye kintu.
Good.	Kirungi.
What is going on in this city.	Kiki ekigenda mu maaso mu kibuga kino.
And there is no way.	Era tewali ngeri yonna.
That’s what he has to say.	Ekyo ky’alina okwogera.
But in practice, no.	Naye mu nkola, nedda.
Maybe that will happen here.	Mpozzi ekyo kijja kubaawo wano.
Everyone does it, every day.	Buli muntu akikola, buli lunaku.
But that is not the case today.	Naye ekyo si bwe kiri leero.
It is very, very important.	Kikulu nnyo nnyo.
They were exactly what they were in everything.	Baali ddala kye baali mu buli kimu.
He did, actually.	Yakikola, mu butuufu.
He obviously thought he was doing pretty well.	Kya lwatu nti yali alowooza nti yali akola bulungi nnyo.
I have no idea.	Nze sirina kirowoozo kyonna.
I just love this book.	Njagala nnyo ekitabo kino kyokka.
And we have work to do.	Era tulina omulimu gwe tulina okukola.
Maybe he should have continued anyway.	Mpozzi yandibadde agenda mu maaso mu ngeri yonna.
You don’t want to be in that position.	Toyagala kubeera mu kifo ekyo.
It was time to move on.	Kyali kiseera okugenda mu maaso.
You’re not quite alone.	Toli wekka nnyo.
I wanted to be like my dad.	Nnali njagala okubeera nga taata wange.
Easier said than done.	Kyangu okwogera okusinga okulowooza.
None of my issues.	Tewali nsonga yange yonna.
I’m happy though.	Nze ndi musanyufu wadde.
But that one dog was mine.	Naye embwa eyo emu yali yange.
Probably not just the father.	Oboolyawo si taata yekka.
Actually, he wasn’t.	Mu butuufu, si bwe yali.
It was just normal.	Kyali kya bulijjo kyokka.
We don't have.	Tetulina...
But it will never happen again.	Naye tekijja kuddamu kubaawo.
I’d love to go, but we’ll see.	Njagala nnyo okugenda, naye tujja kulaba.
He and everyone else.	Ye ne buli muntu.
He had to get out of here.	Yalina okuva wano.
He saw that she was very safe.	Yalaba nti yali talina bulabe nnyo.
He could do anything, be anything.	Yali asobola okukola ekintu kyonna, okuba ekintu kyonna.
I always wanted to be like him.	Bulijjo nnali njagala nnyo okubeera nga ye.
But it’s all the same thing.	Naye byonna kintu kye kimu.
He says so, anyway.	Agamba bw’atyo, mu ngeri yonna.
It was pretty cool, really.	Kyali kirungi nnyo, ddala.
And, you know, that was it.	Era, omanyi, ekyo kye kyali.
Not for anyone, not for anything.	Si lwa muntu yenna, si lwa kintu kyonna.
This was going to work.	Kino kyali kigenda kukola.
I definitely loved this book.	Mazima ddala ekitabo kino nnali njagala nnyo.
No vision problems.	Tewali buzibu bwa kulaba.
You’re not the problem, yes.	Si ggwe obuzibu, ye.
That was really hard for me.	Ekyo kyali kizibu nnyo ddala gyendi.
But he has to move on.	Naye alina okugenda mu maaso.
The problem is he's not home tonight.	Obuzibu tali waka ekiro kino.
He was a man.	Yali musajja.
He agreed to speak.	Yakkiriza okwogera.
But nothing of the sort.	Naye tewali kintu kya ngeri eyo.
He doesn't know what to do.	Tamanyi kya kukola.
But here it is the same.	Naye wano kye kimu.
Don’t know if this is true.	Tomanyi oba kino kituufu.
He needs your car.	Yeetaaga mmotoka yo.
And neither is it with you.	Era naawe si bwe kiri.
He is the only child.	Ye mwana yekka.
He looked very sick.	Yalabika nga mulwadde nnyo.
What a blessing for us.	Nga omukisa gye tuli.
And not too much.	Era si nnyo.
There are many reasons.	Waliwo ensonga nnyingi.
That’s not always the case, of course.	Ekyo si bwe kiri bulijjo, ddala.
We are exactly the same.	Ffe tuli kye kimu ddala.
I want so many things.	Njagala ebintu bingi nnyo.
And he was my friend.	Era yali mukwano gwange.
When he could.	Bwe yali asobola.
He is not in this room.	Tali mu kisenge kino.
I do move on.	Nze nkola okugenda mu maaso.
And that’s dangerous.	Era ekyo kya bulabe.
However, I am sure he will be back soon.	Kyokka nkakasa nti ajja kudda amangu ddala.
And he did it too.	Era naye yakikola.
Now, very quickly .	Kati, mu bwangu ddala .
Which is difficult to do.	Ekintu ekizibu okukola.
But there is no one.	Naye tewali muntu yenna.
We can all go together.	Ffenna tusobola okugenda ffenna.
Both are in good shape.	Bombi bali mu mbeera nnungi.
However, that is good to know.	Kyokka, ekyo kirungi okumanya.
He tried, but couldn’t do it.	Yagezaako, naye nga tasobola kukikola.
Everyone goes with this.	Buli omu agenda ne kino.
It was a room.	Kyali kisenge.
Today he had a job he loved.	Leero yalina omulimu gwe yali ayagala ennyo.
I’m all in for it.	Nze byonna ndi mu.
That is definitely his car though.	Eyo mazima ddala mmotoka ye wadde.
Now I know this is not the case.	Kati nkimanyi nti kino si bwe kiri.
It would be nice and easy.	Kyandibadde kirungi era nga kyangu.
He could have said that.	Ekyo yandibadde asobola okwogera.
But we’re going to try.	Naye tugenda kugezaako.
It’s good that we’re here now.	Kirungi nti tuli wano kati.
You should have been here.	Wandibadde wano.
I have to hit hard.	Nnina okukuba ennyo.
But he has to work alone.	Naye alina okukola yekka.
And the book is accurate.	Era ekitabo kituufu.
It would be hard to make that movie today.	Kyandibadde kizibu okukola firimu eyo leero.
Almost hit but .	Kumpi okukuba naye .
Such a thing is not uncommon.	Ekintu ng’ekyo si kya bulijjo.
And now he didn't even have that.	Era kati ekyo yali talina wadde.
So much for me.	Bingi nnyo gyendi.
I will go to the police myself about this .	Nze kennyini nja kugenda ku poliisi ku nsonga eno .
It is a simple but beautiful place.	Kifo kyangu naye nga kirungi nnyo.
But the problem is where and when.	Naye obuzibu buli wa era ddi.
I still don’t know which one.	Nze n’okutuusa kati simanyi ki.
He must know.	Ateekwa okumanya.
He is completely beneath her.	Ali wansi we ddala.
He would do what he needed to do.	Yandikoze ekyo kye yali yeetaaga okukola.
Perhaps it can help.	Oboolyawo kiyinza okuyamba.
Now they are.	Kati bwe bali.
I want to know that he will be okay.	Njagala okumanya nti ajja kuba bulungi.
Everyone got one.	Buli omu yafuna emu.
And he was very young.	Era yali muto nnyo.
It’s my father’s watch.	Essaawa ya taata.
He knew he always would.	Yali akimanyi nti bulijjo ajja kukikola.
. . . .	.
I, not you.	Nze, si ggwe.
I think that was both good and bad.	Ndowooza ekyo kyali kirungi era kibi.
You could do anything, really.	Oyinza okukola ekintu kyonna, ddala.
It’s not always about the player.	Si bulijjo nti kya muzannyi.
Where are you if you were alone.	Oli ludda wa singa wali wekka.
We have to get out of here.	Tulina okuva wano.
I was like you.	Nze nali nga ggwe.
However, it will not be so easy.	Kyokka, tekijja kuba kyangu nnyo.
But it was terrible.	Naye kyali kibi nnyo.
That's why we're here.	Eno y'ensonga lwaki tuli wano.
Everything is true.	Buli kimu mazima.
Not really like you.	Mu butuufu si nga ggwe.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
This is a very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
Almost certainly not a good idea.	Kumpi ddala si kirowoozo kirungi.
there's a good one for you.	waliwo omulungi gy'oli.
Is everything okay? 	Buli kimu kirungi?
Everyone knows everyone here.	Buli omu amanyi buli muntu wano.
He was nobody, nobody.	Yali si muntu yenna, tewali muntu yenna.
This would be great.	Kino kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
Now he could go to work.	Kati yali asobola okugenda ku mulimu.
You are my only friend.	Ggwe mukwano gwange wekka.
We must always be on side.	Bulijjo tulina okubeera ku ludda.
It’s a very important thing.	Kikulu nnyo.
Nothing good for me.	Tewali kirungi kyonna gyendi.
He has a plan, too.	Alina enteekateeka, naye.
I'm not quite sure what it is.	Sikakasa bulungi kiki kye kiri.
Less .	Katono .
That’s not all there is to it.	Ekyo si kye kyokka.
I’ve always wanted one.	Bulijjo njagala emu.
No such luck, even today.	Tewali mukisa nga guno, ne leero.
He was busy.	Yali bbize.
He was sick.	Yali mulwadde.
I’m not the only one.	Si nze nzekka.
And I'm with me.	Nange nange.
I need everyone there.	Nneetaaga buli muntu ali eyo.
It was the right thing to do.	Kyali kintu kituufu okukola.
I am his son.	Nze mwana we.
But no one goes to jail.	Naye tewali agenda mu kkomera.
Everyone is afraid of everything.	Buli muntu atya buli kimu.
I can't find any help with this.	Sisobola kufuna buyambi bwonna ku kino.
It was all he could do.	Kye kyokka kye yali asobola okukola.
It seems right to me.	Kirabika kituufu gyendi.
We have to be in that place.	Tulina okubeera mu kifo ekyo.
I don’t have time to say more.	Sirina budde kwogera bingi.
It was very difficult.	Kyali kizibu nnyo.
There they were.	Eyo gye baali.
That is not the case.	Ekyo si bwe kiri.
Very true, very true.	Kituufu nnyo, kituufu nnyo.
You have to go to them for help.	Olina okugenda gye bali okufuna obuyambi.
Here, that is not the case.	Wano, ekyo si bwe kiri.
Things we are so close to seeing.	Ebintu bye tuli kumpi nnyo okulaba.
And it’s on.	Era kiri ku.
We are both fine.	Ffembi tuli bulungi.
Obviously, it wasn’t what he wanted.	Kya lwatu nti si kye yali ayagala.
His friends are not.	Mikwano gye si bwe bali.
And that’s important.	Era ekyo kikulu.
I think now you can.	Ndowooza kati osobola.
Everything down there.	Buli kimu wansi awo.
I was fine.	Nnali bulungi.
I don’t even want to know about it.	Saagala na kumanya ku nsonga eyo.
It wasn’t much of an issue for me.	Yali si nsonga nnyo gyendi.
It's here right now.	Kiri wano mu kiseera kino.
I’m here too.	Nze nange ndi wano.
Of course, it can happen.	Kya lwatu nti kiyinza okubaawo.
He would like to talk to her about it.	Yandiyagadde okwogera naye ku nsonga eyo.
I am very lucky indeed.	Ndi wa mukisa nnyo ddala.
It was really realistic.	Ddala kyali kya ddala.
You may be the same.	Naawe oyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
He certainly had.	Mazima ddala yalina.
But that one will do it.	Naye oyo ajja kukikola.
It’s always so easy.	Bulijjo kyangu nnyo.
And he hadn’t done it yet.	Era yali tannaba kukola.
He was always happy.	Bulijjo yali musanyufu.
He didn't know how to answer this.	Kino yali tamanyi ngeri ya kuddamu.
It was actually really good.	Mu butuufu kyali kirungi ddala.
But it’s hard right now.	Naye kizibu mu kiseera kino.
Soon, everyone would.	Mu bbanga ttono, buli omu yandikoze.
He is not a person with a problem.	Si muntu alina ekizibu.
He is alone in the room.	Ali yekka mu kisenge.
I'm sorry, my son.	Nsonyiwa mwana wange.
I really wanted that.	Ekyo nnali njagala nnyo.
Now you have a problem.	Kati olina ekizibu.
Not that this was unusual.	Si nti kino kyali kya bulijjo.
That’s not good for me.	Ekyo si kirungi gyendi.
He had always been like that.	Bulijjo yali abadde bw’atyo.
It’s just for you.	Kya ggwe wekka.
But today no one lives like that.	Naye leero tewali muntu yenna abeera bw’atyo.
But you probably already knew that.	Naye osanga ekyo wali okimanyi dda.
Don’t know what this was.	Tomanyi kino kye kyali.
That’s not a helpful attitude.	Eyo si ndowooza ya kuyamba.
This is my classroom.	Kino kye kibiina kyange.
I will do as he asked.	Nja kukola nga bwe yasaba.
All right, here we go.	Kirungi, wano we tugenda.
You have it very easy.	Olina kyangu nnyo.
I’m sorry to see you go.	Nsonyiwa okulaba nga ogenda.
He is my friend.	Ye mukwano gwange.
Perhaps he had no choice.	Oboolyawo yali talina kya kukola.
It is the whole concept.	Ye ndowooza yonna.
That they were dangerous.	Nti baali ba bulabe.
I would love to know!.	Njagala nnyo okumanya!.
I couldn’t get anything going.	Nnali sisobola kufuna kintu kyonna kigenda mu maaso.
Although he could well .	Wadde nga yali asobola bulungi .
This issue is not about the issue.	Ensonga eno si ku nsonga.
You want to go.	Oyagala kugenda.
But it looks good to me.	Naye kirabika bulungi gyendi.
He thinks so much.	Alowooza nnyo bw'atyo.
And this isn’t all.	Era bino si byonna.
She looks good tonight.	Alabika bulungi ekiro kino.
And yet here it is.	Era naye wano we kiri.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
Like me now.	Nga nze kati.
He made many arrangements.	Yakola enteekateeka nnyingi.
I guess it doesn’t really matter now.	Ntebereza nti kati si kikulu nnyo.
The arrangement worked very well.	Enteekateeka yakola bulungi nnyo.
He is a young child.	Ye mwana muto.
She was so beautiful.	Yali mulungi nnyo.
This is an opportunity.	Guno mukisa.
It is not an ideological view.	Si ndowooza ya ndowooza.
It wasn’t like that for me.	Si bwe kyali gyendi.
Despite himself, he suddenly got in trouble.	Wadde nga ye kennyini, yafuna obuzibu mu bwangu.
It is not the case now.	Si bwe kiri kati.
This is not the time for them.	Kino si kye kiseera gye bali.
He was speaking.	Yali ayogera.
Where we were.	Gye twali.
I just have a picture with him.	Nze nnina ekifaananyi kyokka naye.
If anyone knows about it.	Singa waliwo amanyi ku nsonga eyo.
You have to do very well.	Olina okukola obulungi ennyo.
That’s what it is.	Ekyo kye kiri.
Not a child.	Si mwana.
This is a very serious issue.	Eno nsonga ya maanyi nnyo.
He wanted to work.	Yali ayagala kukola.
Here, eating this.	Wano, okulya kino.
He thought he didn't know what it was.	Yalowooza nti yali tamanyi kye kyali.
I'll go now.	Nja kugenda kati.
I had no idea what to do.	Nnali sirina kye mmanyi kye nnyinza kukola.
And he knew so much about so much.	Era yali amanyi bingi nnyo ku bingi nnyo.
But you are strong, strong.	Naye ggwe oli wa maanyi, wa maanyi.
There is no mention of him.	Tewali kwogera ku ye.
He has something to ask for.	Alina kye yasaba.
You have no idea, she thought.	Tolina kirowoozo kyonna, bwe yalowooza.
I said no, it would be great.	Nagamba nti nedda, kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
You’re here for a reason.	Oli wano lwa nsonga.
This was my room.	Kino kye kyali kisenge kyange.
Living out of this.	Okubeera okuva mu kino.
He was still well then.	Yali akyali bulungi mu kiseera ekyo.
I need the time.	Nze nneetaaga obudde.
I couldn’t drive.	Nnali sisobola kuvuga.
I know it will happen as well.	Nkimanyi nti kijja kubaawo nga bwe kyali.
That is what really matters.	Ekyo kye kikulu ennyo.
It’s not a problem of complexity.	Si kizibu kya buzibu.
That everything is fine.	Nti buli kimu kiri bulungi.
This will be much easier.	Kino kijja kuba kyangu nnyo.
He wanted all of us.	Yali ayagala ffenna.
It is a very powerful thing.	Kintu kya maanyi nnyo.
I always want to say that.	Bulijjo njagala okwogera ekyo.
That is good and true.	Ekyo kirungi era kituufu.
I was pretty sure of that.	Ekyo nnali nkakasa bulungi.
Not very good, really.	Si kirungi nnyo, ddala.
You are not here to make money.	Toli wano kukola ssente.
And it was pretty cool.	Era kyali kirungi nnyo.
He will be here soon.	Ajja kubeera wano mu bbanga ttono.
He had hope, of course.	Yalina essuubi, ddala.
Almost talking to me.	Kumpi okwogera nange.
And he is dangerous.	Era wa bulabe.
This was all his plan.	Bino byonna yali nteekateeka ye.
It’s easy to deal with.	Kyangu okukola ku nsonga.
You either have it or you don’t.	Oba olina oba tolina.
That was a problem.	Ekyo kyali kizibu.
It’s not winning.	Si kuwangula.
I don’t want to talk about this.	Kino saagala kwogera ku nsonga eno.
I feel so much better now.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo kati.
There was one guy.	Waliwo ggaayi omu.
We are what we are.	Ffe tuli kye tuli.
Maybe he had to work.	Mpozzi yalina okukola.
Who knows what will happen in the future.	Ani amanyi ekigenda okubaawo mu maaso.
It looks great.	Kirabika bulungi nnyo.
That’s a very important thing.	Ekyo kikulu nnyo.
That’s very much on him.	Ekyo kiri ku ye nnyo.
I like to be alone.	Njagala nnyo okubeera nzekka.
He may be here already.	Ayinza okuba wano dda.
Which is, well, bad.	Ekintu, bulungi, kibi.
I still can’t believe this.	Kino n’okutuusa kati sisobola kukkiriza.
It's good, it's good.	Kirungi, kirungi.
You can think of something.	Osobola okulowooza ku kintu.
No one was talking now.	Tewali yali ayogera kati.
He knows how to win.	Amanyi okuwangula.
This is one of the.	Kino kye kimu ku...
Or nothing can happen.	Oba tewali kintu kyonna kiyinza kubaawo.
No work, nothing.	Tewali mulimu, tewali.
We’ll see a lot of these.	Tujja kulaba nga bino bingi nnyo.
And you will do it.	Era ojja kukikola.
He's just that good.	Ye mulungi bw'atyo yekka.
You are just like everyone else.	Oli nga buli muntu omulala.
We don’t have to talk about that.	Ekyo tetulina kwogera ku nsonga eyo.
He couldn’t have known.	Yali tayinza kumanya.
He was happy to do it.	Yali musanyufu okukikola.
It was his favorite time of day.	Kyali kiseera kye yali ayagala ennyo mu lunaku.
But that’s not my point.	Naye ekyo si nsonga yange.
It won’t be easy.	Tekijja kuba kyangu.
I hope that it is.	Nsuubira nti bwe kiri.
I just have to wait.	Nnina kulinda kyokka.
I want to talk to you.	Njagala okwogera naawe.
However, probably not.	Kyokka, oboolyawo si bwe kiri.
It was the truth.	Yali mazima.
I need to talk to you about someone.	Nze nneetaaga okwogera naawe ku muntu.
He knew so much.	Yali amanyi bingi nnyo.
I couldn’t see what it would be.	Nnali sisobola kulaba kye kyandibadde.
Here we are.	Wano we tuli.
I really needed to read that today.	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga nnyo okusoma leero.
But someone does.	Naye waliwo akola.
There is no problem with that.	Tewali buzibu bwonna ku ekyo.
And what he is to me, he is.	Era ky’ali gyendi, y’ali.
I think he was just there.	Ndowooza yali awo yekka.
One can easily see why.	Omuntu asobola bulungi okulaba lwaki.
Today it is not.	Leero si bwe kiri.
It’s really there.	Ddala kiri awo.
That would be great.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi nnyo.
I’m doing fine.	Nze nkola bulungi.
That's probably my problem.	Ekyo osanga kye kizibu kyange.
This is why he was dangerous to me.	Eno y’ensonga lwaki yali wa bulabe gyendi.
That’s what’s there.	Ekyo kye kiri awo.
Honestly, it seems a little low to me.	Mu butuufu, kirabika nga kya wansi katono gyendi.
A lot of planning, you know.	Enteekateeka nnyingi, omanyi.
You know very well that it is not me.	Okimanyi bulungi nti si nze.
As he himself saw fit .	Nga ye kennyini bwe yalaba nga kituufu .
I was home sick.	Nali waka nga ndi mulwadde.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
Not now and not here.	Si kati era si wano.
I'm going to talk to him.	Ngenda kwogera naye.
I’m not the same.	Nze si kye kimu.
He just couldn’t do it.	Yali tasobola kukikola kyokka.
I couldn’t do my job.	Nnali sisobola kukola mulimu gwange.
No matter where they are, when they are.	Ne bwe bali wa, ddi lwe bali.
It’s time to go.	Kye kiseera okugenda.
It was a bad thing.	Kyali kintu kibi.
He makes everything better.	Akola buli kimu nga kirungi.
You're pretty good, actually.	Oli mulungi nnyo, mu butuufu.
But it’s not true.	Naye si kituufu.
Maybe you want to be with me.	Mpozzi oyagala kubeera nange.
This is certainly true.	Kino mazima ddala kituufu.
Nothing normal in that.	Tewali kintu kya bulijjo mu ekyo.
For so many hours.	Okumala essaawa nnyingi nnyo.
I really wanted this.	Kino nnali njagala nnyo.
I wonder about that.	Ekyo nneebuuza.
Excellent work!.	Omulimu omulungi ennyo!.
Everyone is really happy.	Buli omu musanyufu ddala.
It is my duty to speak.	Omulimu gwange okwogera.
He wanted to go.	Yali ayagala kugenda.
There is someone else in this house.	Mu nnyumba eno mulimu omuntu omulala.
He is in danger.	Ali mu bulabe.
But he knew exactly what he was.	Naye yali amanyi ddala kye yali.
We have to move on now.	Tulina okugenda mu maaso kati.
He is not here right now.	Tali wano mu kiseera kino.
I couldn’t believe how easy it was to do.	Nnali siyinza kukkiriza ngeri gye kyali kyangu okukola.
It was much easier than that.	Kyali kyangu nnyo okusinga ekyo.
You can see exactly where you were.	Osobola okulaba ddala gye wali.
And it’s going to be me.	Era kigenda kuba nze.
Very low in fact.	Wansi nnyo mu butuufu.
This is a practice.	Eno nkola.
It’s not what matters.	Si kye kikulu.
We are fine now.	Tuli bulungi kati.
He is a lucky, lucky man.	Ye musajja wa mukisa, wa mukisa.
I want to too!.	Nange njagala!.
No one will get in trouble.	Tewali ajja kufuna buzibu.
That is my opinion.	Eyo ye ndowooza yange.
Something is going on.	Waliwo ekigenda mu maaso.
And well, it’s not.	Era bulungi, si bwe kiri.
Where is he? 	Ali ludda wa?
We will belong to each other.	Tujja kuba ba buli omu.
I wonder why?.	Nneebuuza lwaki?.
We cannot do this alone.	Kino tetusobola kukikola ffekka.
It’s not a serious thing.	Si kintu kya maanyi.
It’s not all his business.	Si nsonga ye yonna.
However, it is not a common problem.	Kyokka, si kizibu kya bulijjo.
It’s really very, very important.	Ddala kikulu nnyo nnyo.
It’s a real thing.	Kintu kya ddala.
And a lot of money.	Ne ssente nnyingi.
I don’t know what to do with this.	Kino simanyi kye nnyinza kukola.
This is it, he thought.	Kino kye kiri, bwe yalowooza.
It could be this car.	Kiyinza okuba mmotoka eno.
It was a very friendly arrangement.	Yali nteekateeka ya mukwano nnyo.
He was here an hour ago.	Yali wano essaawa emu emabega.
That’s where it was.	Eyo gye kyali.
Too easy, perhaps.	Kyangu nnyo, mpozzi.
What they are nobody knows.	Kye bali tewali amanyi.
I hope to do the same here.	Nsuubira okukola kye kimu wano.
I know what’s going to happen.	Nze mmanyi ekigenda okubaawo.
I needed one now.	Nnali nneetaaga emu kati.
He almost expected her to.	Yali kumpi asuubira nti ajja kukikola.
He was trying.	Yali agezaako.
Here, you can do anything.	Wano, osobola okukola ekintu kyonna.
That would be nice.	Ekyo kyandibadde kirungi.
I can swim, obviously.	Nsobola okuwuga, kya lwatu.
I love to work.	Njagala nnyo okukola.
I can talk myself into anything.	Nsobola okwogera nzekka mu kintu kyonna.
He wasn't as strong.	Yali si wa maanyi nga ye.
But that would be too easy.	Naye ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
No problem'.	Tewali buzibu'.
It is very dangerous	Kya bulabe nnyo .
I am now afraid.	Nze kati ntya.
I feel so much better.	Mpulira bulungi nnyo.
Of course, he could leave the house.	Kya lwatu nti yali asobola okuva mu nnyumba.
You know, you can get something.	Omanyi, osobola okufuna ekintu.
And that may well be the case.	Era ekyo kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
That will work fine.	Ekyo kijja kukola bulungi.
He was lucky to have her, he really was.	Yali wa mukisa okubeera naye, ddala yali.
But in this case, that’s just not true.	Naye mu mbeera eno, ekyo kyokka si kituufu.
He was always very interested.	Bulijjo yali ayagala nnyo.
I won’t say anything.	Sijja kwogera kintu kyonna.
We need these things.	Twetaaga ebintu bino.
That’s what we’re here for.	Ekyo kye tuli wano.
And now it isn’t.	Era kati si bwe kiri.
I hope everyone knows it.	Nsuubira buli omu akimanyi.
That must be the child.	Oyo alina okuba nga ye mwana.
And she on him now.	Era ye ku ye kati.
He thought backwards.	Yalowooza emabega.
Everyone speaks as well as I do.	Buli omu ayogera bulungi nga nze.
And not for long.	Era si lwa bbanga ddene.
But you know you really have to eat.	Naye okimanyi nti ddala olina okulya.
It will be close.	Kijja kuba kumpi.
That is the essence of my problem.	Ekyo kye kikulu ekizibu kyange.
No, of course.	Nedda, ddala.
It would be better this way.	Kyandibadde kirungi mu ngeri eno.
Good to know.	Kirungi okumanya.
He is his friend.	Ye mukwano gwe.
That it certainly was.	Nti mazima ddala bwe kyali.
But that was the thing .	Naye ekyo kye kyali ekintu .
There are so many problems.	Obuzibu bungi nnyo.
It was just there.	Kyali awo kyokka.
Everyone needs someone.	Buli muntu yeetaaga omuntu.
I feel completely at home.	Mpulira ddala nga ndi waka.
Nothing there now, nothing to see.	Tewali kintu kyonna awo kati, tewali kya kulaba.
You can see nothing wrong with that.	Ekyo tosobola kulaba kibi kyonna.
I hope that’s true for all of us.	Nsuubira nti ekyo kituufu eri ffenna.
Not any organization.	Si kibiina kyonna.
He can't come.	Tasobola kujja.
But that’s just the front.	Naye ekyo kya maaso kyokka.
And you are alone.	Era oli wekka.
In fact, he had no choice.	Mu butuufu, yali talina kya kukola.
I am very happy.	Ndi musanyufu nnyo.
It will be hard, of course.	Kijja kuba kizibu, ddala.
How about someone who is below average.	Oba otya omuntu ali wansi wa bulijjo.
This is completely normal.	Kino kya bulijjo ddala.
But there was nothing.	Naye nga tewali.
This, to me, is terrible.	Kino, gyendi, kibi nnyo.
You won’t even know.	Tojja na kumanya.
Not too bad here.	Si kibi nnyo wano.
No, he’s not with me.	Nedda, tali nange.
I just knew it.	Nze nnali mmanyi kyokka.
I would love to help!.	Njagala nnyo okuyamba!.
He was doing the work.	Yali akola omulimu.
I am alone with him.	Nze naye yekka.
I will say one thing.	Nja kwogera ekintu kimu.
Or maybe he didn’t need to.	Oba oboolyawo yali teyeetaaga.
Or he did it.	Oba yakikola.
I really, really want to do that again.	Nze ddala, ddala njagala okuddamu okukola ekyo.
It certainly wasn’t.	Mazima ddala si bwe kyali.
We have a lot of things to do.	Tulina ebintu bingi bye tulina okukola.
I know this is hard.	Nkimanyi kino kizibu.
And that, frankly, is fine.	Era ekyo, mu butuufu, kirungi.
That won’t do it.	Ekyo tekijja kukikola.
Next week.	Wiiki ejja.
And you probably will.	Era oboolyawo ojja kukikola.
I am a human being.	Nze ndi muntu.
He is currently in the same position.	Mu kiseera kino ali mu kifo kye kimu.
I almost wish he would.	Kumpi njagala yandikoze.
Or a lot more.	Oba bingi nnyo.
He loves being with you.	Ayagala nnyo okubeera naawe.
Where he was still good.	We yali akyali mulungi.
This is not why he came here.	Eno si y’ensonga lwaki yajja wano.
Back to ya.	Okudda ku ya.
He could see much better now.	Yali asobola okulaba obulungi ennyo kati.
What he was now.	Kye yali kati.
I think this is good.	Nze ndowooza nti kino kirungi.
You are here, in the now.	Oli wano, mu kati.
He couldn’t work anymore.	Yali tasobola kuddamu kukola.
At that time.	Mu kiseera ekyo.
No one knows for sure.	Tewali amanyi bulungi.
He didn’t know exactly.	Yali tamanyi bulungi.
I’m not happy.	Nze siri musanyufu.
Here, it is very dangerous.	Wano, kya bulabe nnyo.
We cannot accept this.	Kino tetusobola kukkiriza.
I pray everywhere for everything.	Nsaba buli wamu ku buli kimu.
Wish .	Singa .
But, who knows.	Naye, ani amanyi.
. . . .	.
I think he's in his office.	Ndowooza ali mu ofiisi ye.
He has to answer.	Alina okuddamu.
For anyone else, this would be normal.	Ku muntu omulala yenna, kino kyandibadde kya bulijjo.
And we are very close.	Era tuli ba mukwano nnyo.
And here he was happy.	Era wano yali musanyufu.
He loved movies.	Yali ayagala nnyo firimu.
It was a really beautiful place.	Ddala kyali kifo kirungi nnyo.
He didn't want to say what he did.	Yali tayagala kwogera kye yakola.
But that will come.	Naye ekyo kijja kujja.
And the whole thing .	Era ekintu kyonna .
He said he had no choice.	Yagambye nti talina kya kukola.
Maybe it’s mine.	Mpozzi nga ye wange.
My father had a job.	Taata yalina omulimu.
It’s hard now, you know.	Kizibu kati, omanyi.
He likes to talk about me.	Ayagala nnyo okwogera ku nze.
As it is, it is.	Nga bwe kiri.
But now! 	Naye kati!
. . . .	.
It was what he saw, and that’s all.	Kyali ekyo kye yalaba, era ekyo kyokka.
But not for much.	Naye si lwa bingi.
Everything is fine.	Buli kimu kiri bulungi.
It’s as bad as it can be.	Kibi nga bwe kiyinza okuba.
I wonder why.	Nze nneebuuza lwaki.
Together we can.	Nga tuli wamu tusobola.
I'm going to say that.	Nze okugamba nti.
His manner was very fortunate.	Engeri ye yali ya mukisa nnyo.
It's just bad right now.	Kibi kyokka mu kiseera kino.
He was very fast.	Yali wa bwangu nnyo.
I don’t care.	Sifaayo.
But with you .	Naye nga naawe .
And maybe we were.	Era mpozzi nga twali.
That was what it was at the time.	Ekyo kye kyali mu kiseera ekyo.
I don’t know anything.	Nze simanyi kintu kyonna.
The same thing can happen again.	Ekintu kye kimu kiyinza okuddamu okubaawo.
He is doing well.	Akola bulungi.
It’s not the same thing.	Si kintu kye kimu.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
How are you?.	Oli otya?.
Why, almost no place looks good.	Lwaki, kumpi tewali kifo kyonna kirabika bulungi.
Nobody was good.	Tewali muntu yenna yali mulungi.
Or you may not have.	Oba oyinza okuba nga tolina.
He had no choice in the matter.	Yali talina kya kukola mu nsonga eyo.
He went, as he should have.	Yagenda, nga bwe yandibadde.
In practice, there is no issue for you.	Mu nkola, tewali nsonga yonna gy’oli.
Everything is excellent.	Buli kimu kirungi nnyo.
I’m not sure that’s true.	Sikakasa nti ekyo kituufu.
He is he, the one and only.	Ye ye, omu era yekka.
I don't know.	Simanyi.
Right now, it’s not realistic.	Mu kiseera kino, si kya ddala.
It’s a quick thing.	Kintu kya mangu.
Now this is great.	Kati kino kirungi nnyo.
But, of course, you already are.	Naye, mazima ddala, wali dda.
I am at work	Ndi ku mulimu .
But this won’t work.	Naye kino tekijja kukola.
It doesn’t come.	Tekijja.
I can’t believe it either!.	Nze nange siyinza kukkiriza!.
He doesn’t seem to think it’s dangerous.	Alabika talowooza nti kya bulabe.
We are all friends.	Ffenna tuli ba mukwano.
He loves talking to you.	Ayagala nnyo okwogera naawe.
You have a job.	Olina omulimu.
I would love to know from them.	Njagala nnyo okumanya okuva gye bali.
That was certainly it.	Mazima ddala ekyo kye kyali.
You said you wanted to go to school.	Wagamba nti oyagala kugenda ku ssomero.
That was normal in that situation.	Ekyo kyali kya bulijjo mu mbeera eyo.
We need to know these things.	Tulina okumanya ebintu bino.
It’s not good or bad or anything.	Si kirungi oba kibi oba ekintu kyonna.
I love tomorrow.	Njagala nnyo enkya.
This was much harder than he expected.	Kino kyali kizibu nnyo okusinga bwe yali asuubira.
He wishes he could have.	Ayagala nnyo yandibadde.
But it really is a labor of love.	Naye ddala mulimu gwa kwagala.
He had to think.	Yalina okulowooza.
You’re in a hurry.	Oli mu bwangu nnyo.
That’s what he said.	Ekyo kye yayogera.
We can’t allow that for too long.	Ekyo tetusobola kukkiriza kumala bbanga ddene nnyo.
He wouldn’t have been able to do it.	Yandibadde tasobola kukikola.
French of course.	Olufaransa ddala.
This may be the case.	Kino kiyinza okuba nga bwe kiri.
He hits hard.	Akuba nnyo.
I knew this would happen.	Nali nkimanyi nti kino kijja kubaawo.
However, the phone was normal.	Kyokka, essimu yali ya bulijjo.
Not bad, not bad.	Si kibi, si kibi.
He is young.	Ye muto.
That’s pretty easy to do.	Ekyo kyangu nnyo okukola.
You can always back out either way.	Bulijjo osobola okudda emabega mu ngeri yonna.
No luck for me.	Tewali mukisa gyendi.
No chance of that now though.	Tewali mukisa gwa ekyo kati wadde.
And so he asked.	Era bwatyo bwe yabuuza.
You want one.	Oyagala emu.
I'm not sure what to do here.	Sikakasa kya kukola wano.
I think something like this could work.	Nze ndowooza ekintu nga kino kiyinza okukola.
You know how he was before.	Omanyi bwe yali emabegako.
Here is something.	Wano waliwo ekintu.
He wanted to stay.	Yali ayagala kusigala.
Although, not much at the moment.	Wadde, si bingi mu kiseera kino.
I needed time for that.	Ekyo nnali nneetaaga obudde.
He could go to the police.	Yali asobola okugenda ku poliisi.
My father knew everything.	Taata yali amanyi buli kimu.
I need one too.	Nange nneetaaga emu.
Now you know why.	Kati omanyi lwaki.
It is very important indeed.	Kikulu nnyo ddala.
However, there is already a problem.	Kyokka dda waliwo ekizibu.
He thought he could do better where he was.	Yalowooza nti asobola okukola obulungi w’ali.
And a chance to know how he had .	Era omukisa okumanya engeri gye yalina .
It can be a challenge.	Kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
You always know it’s there.	Bulijjo okimanyi nti kiri awo.
He did this.	Kino yakikola.
Why everyone loves it.	Lwaki buli omu ayagala nnyo.
That may be true.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba nga kituufu.
I don’t even want to talk to the guy.	Nze saagala na kwogera na ggaayi oyo.
But he was my brother.	Naye yali muganda wange.
No, it was very dangerous.	Nedda, kyali kya bulabe nnyo.
We all have to do it.	Ffenna tulina okukikola.
It will be good for us.	Kijja kuba kirungi gye tuli.
I’m not like my brother.	Nze siri nga muganda wange.
How do I do it.	Nkola ntya okukikola.
I’m not as good as you.	Nze siri mulungi nga ggwe.
It will be hard work.	Kijja kuba mulimu gwa maanyi.
He should have known that.	Ekyo yandibadde akimanyi.
But it’s not quite as easy as it sounds.	Naye si kyangu nnyo nga bwe kirabika.
He did as it is.	Yakola nga bwe kiri.
He did well.	Yakola bulungi.
It may or may not happen.	Kiyinza okubaawo oba nedda.
Now he was speaking.	Kati yali ayogera.
He couldn’t.	Yali tasobola.
We are the same.	Ffe tuli kimu.
That was all he wanted.	Ekyo kyokka kye yali ayagala.
The other will stay behind.	Omulala ajja kusigala emabega.
Not that he could.	Si nti yali asobola.
Just us, as always.	Ffe ffekka, nga bulijjo.
Now it’s real.	Kati kya ddala.
He couldn’t see the point.	Yali tasobola kulaba nsonga.
That was something, anyway.	Ekyo kyali kintu, mu ngeri yonna.
You will really do it.	Ddala ojja kukikola.
That is a very good point.	Eyo nsonga nnungi nnyo.
But here we were.	Naye wano we twali.
He is obviously a human being.	Kya lwatu nti muntu.
However, it is quite true.	Kyokka, kituufu nnyo.
We’ll see what we can do.	Tujja kulaba kye tusobola okukola.
I wonder about this.	Kino nneebuuza.
I hope you like being alone, as well.	Nsuubira nti oyagala nnyo okubeera wekka, nga.
But he's a nice guy.	Naye ye ggaayi mulungi.
And we will wait.	Era tujja kulinda.
No, he thought.	Nedda, bwe yalowooza.
I couldn’t say anything.	Nnali sisobola kwogera kintu kyonna.
But that is certainly in order.	Naye ekyo mazima ddala kiri mu nteekateeka.
You can do it.	Osobola okukikola.
The same is true of this.	Kye kimu ne kino.
Not immediately, anyway.	Si mangu ddala, mu ngeri yonna.
He's been around for a week.	Amaze wiiki emu.
I know a guy who belongs there.	Nze mmanyi ggaayi nga wa yo.
But it can be a challenge.	Naye kiyinza okuba ekizibu.
However, that is not the issue at this point.	Kyokka eyo si y’ensonga mu kiseera kino.
Everything was quick and easy.	Buli kimu kyali kyangu era nga kyangu.
You don’t have to work with him.	Tolina kukola naye.
He was in good shape.	Yali mu mbeera nnungi.
And it’s not just one.	Era si kimu kyokka.
That would be a lot of money.	Ekyo kyandibadde ssente nnyingi nnyo.
It was a very powerful moment for me.	Kyali kiseera kya maanyi nnyo gyendi.
This is very important to us.	Kino kikulu nnyo gye tuli.
Which is almost the same in practice.	Ekintu kumpi kye kimu mu nkola.
Or that’s the room.	Oba ekyo kye kisenge.
That’s a really bad idea.	Ekyo kirowoozo kibi ddala.
I don’t know why, but you do.	Simanyi lwaki naye ggwe okimanyi.
I’m on him now.	Nze ndi ku ye kati.
No one knew it.	Tewali yali akimanyi.
But either way, he couldn’t answer.	Naye mu ngeri yonna, yali tasobola kuddamu.
The task is to.	Omulimu gwa kukola ku...
No one did it.	Tewali yakikola.
I just want to be me.	Njagala kubeera nze kyokka.
I have a lot of things to do.	Nnina ebintu bingi bye nnina okukola.
It would be hard to do the job.	Kyandibadde kizibu okukola omulimu.
Good, so far so good.	Kirungi, okutuusa kati kirungi nnyo.
I thought he had no one.	Nalowooza nti talina muntu yenna.
I'm not sure how.	Sikakasa ngeri ki.
That’s a thing now.	Ekyo kintu kati.
You wanted to go yourself.	Ggwe kennyini wali oyagala kugenda.
He did well.	Yakola bulungi.
I can't eat.	Sisobola kulya.
Maybe you can’t.	Mpozzi tosobola.
He knows who.	Amanyi ani.
He wasn’t strong.	Yali si wa maanyi.
He works on a money job.	Akola ku mulimu gwa ssente.
But you have to do it yourself.	Naye ggwe kennyini olina okukikola.
Although it probably won’t last long!.	Wadde nga osanga tekijja kumala bbanga ddene!.
We will eat, we will talk.	Tujja kulya, tujja kwogera.
There is no you.	Tewali ggwe.
It can be anything you want.	Kiyinza okuba ekintu kyonna ky’oyagala.
Everyone thinks so.	Buli omu alowooza bw’atyo.
What a beautiful place.	Nga kifo kirungi nnyo.
You should have been sure.	Wandibadde okakasa nti.
He was very interested in .	Yali ayagala nnyo .
He is very happy.	Ali musanyufu nnyo.
I can’t believe it either.	Nange siyinza kukkiriza.
It’s hard to know.	Kizibu okumanya.
You won’t always be .	Bulijjo tojja kuba .
I fear everyone at my job.	Ntya buli muntu ku mulimu gwange.
Almost nothing there.	Kumpi tewali kintu kyonna awo.
All those things.	Ebintu ebyo byonna.
I don’t want to be in this place with him.	Saagala kubeera naye mu kifo kino.
He had to say what he said.	Yalina okwogera bye yayogera.
No, not now.	Nedda, si kati.
It’s one of many.	Kye kimu ku bingi.
They were with me.	Baali nange.
Above all, he knows a lot.	Okusinga byonna, amanyi ebintu bingi.
But most of all.	Naye okusinga byonna.
This looks good.	Kino kirabika bulungi.
He seems to think he has money or something.	Alabika alowooza nti alina ssente oba ekintu kyonna.
And it’s a good thing.	Era kintu kirungi.
Being a foodie is a beautiful thing.	Okubeera omuntu ayagala ennyo emmere kintu kirungi nnyo.
It was actually quite simple.	Mu butuufu kyali kyangu nnyo.
Lucky, that's all it is.	Omukisa, ekyo kyokka kye kiri.
Thus he .	Bwatyo ye .
He thought really hard.	Yalowooza nnyo ddala.
You won’t come.	Ggwe tojja.
I can’t do that right now.	Ekyo sisobola kukikola mu kiseera kino.
But it isn’t.	Naye si bwe kiri.
And no one is talking about him.	Era tewali muntu yenna ayogera ku ye.
This seems to be important.	Kino kirabika nga kikulu.
That would be much easier.	Ekyo kyandibadde kyangu nnyo.
On the bus.	Ku bbaasi.
You’re going to have trouble.	Ogenda kufuna obuzibu.
It was pretty intense .	Yali nnungi nnyo nga ya maanyi .
However, you don’t have to do that.	Kyokka, ekyo tolina kukikola.
No, he didn’t have one.	Nedda, yali talina.
It would be helpful for them.	Kyandibadde kya buyambi gye bali.
And they are fine together.	Era bali bulungi nga bali wamu.
But it’s not too difficult.	Naye si kizibu nnyo.
It will never be there again.	Tekijja kuddamu kubeerawo.
I will come back to this point.	Nja kudda ku nsonga eno.
He was practical.	Yali wa nkola.
I feel confident that they are fine.	Mpulira nga nkakasa nti bali bulungi.
We’re almost there, almost home.	Tuli kumpi awo, kumpi awaka.
It’s not a bad idea.	Si kirowoozo kibi.
Which .	Nga .
He was a very loving man.	Yali musajja ayagala nnyo.
He wants to win.	Ayagala kuwangula.
It seems to me that this is so.	Kirabika gyendi nti kino bwe kiri.
I want everything.	Njagala buli kimu.
That was pretty easy.	Ekyo kyali kyangu nnyo.
It was always the problem.	Bulijjo kye kyali ekizibu.
This is obviously dangerous and won’t help your case.	Kino kirabika kya bulabe era tekijja kuyamba nsonga yo.
It’s not a bad or good thing.	Si kintu kibi oba kirungi.
I know you can do this.	Nkimanyi nti kino osobola okukikola.
We were the only ones.	Twali ffe ffekka.
Anything.	Ekintu kyonna.
That’s a problem.	Ekyo kizibu.
Anyone and .	Omuntu yenna era .
Or the whole morning.	Oba enkya yonna.
It’s not my issue.	Si nsonga yange.
I wanted a relationship with you.	Nnali njagala mukwano naawe.
He knew what he knew.	Yali amanyi kye yali amanyi.
You’re going to be fine.	Ogenda kuba bulungi.
It’s not so easy.	Si kyangu nnyo.
Where exactly is he.	Ye ddala wa.
To say the least.	Okugamba nti.
He knew his interests very well.	Yali amanyi bulungi nnyo ebintu bye yali ayagala ennyo.
Everywhere we have .	Buli we tulina .
That may be your opinion that it is good.	Ekyo kiyinza okuba endowooza yo nti kirungi.
Surely he should have called.	Mazima ddala yandibadde akuba essimu.
But it is what it is.	Naye kye kiri.
That’s probably not a bad idea.	Ekyo osanga si kirowoozo kibi.
You’re so young.	Oli muto nnyo.
He was young.	Yali muto.
I have a problem here.	Nze wano nnina obuzibu.
Just like he really feared.	Nga bwe yali atya ddala.
But he doesn’t have to do that.	Naye ekyo talina kukikola.
Fast processing and delivery.	Okukola amangu n’okutuusa ebintu.
He desperately hoped she wasn't at work.	Yalina essuubi ddene nti tali ku mulimu.
I really don’t know.	Ddala simanyi.
Harder than he expected.	Ekizibu okusinga bwe yali asuubira.
This is practical.	Kino kya nkola.
He told me it would always be mine.	Yang’amba nti bulijjo kijja kuba kyange.
But that could well be a problem.	Naye ekyo kiyinza bulungi okuba ekizibu.
Actually, it’s pretty good.	Mu butuufu, kirungi nnyo.
Now, that’s not true at all.	Kati, ekyo si kituufu n’akatono.
My father could have.	Taata yandibadde asobola.
Perhaps he did.	Oboolyawo yakikola.
The point is obvious.	Ensonga eri mu lwatu.
I need to get out of here.	Nze nneetaaga okuva wano.
But it is very, very real.	Naye kya ddala nnyo nnyo.
