Did he expect it?	Kodi ankayembekezera?
Why is this happening?	N’chifukwa chiyani zimenezi zikuchitika?

This is for you.	Iyi ndi yanu.
If they want to, fine.	Ngati iwo akufuna kutero, chabwino.
He has to be who he is now.	Iye ayenera kukhala yemwe iye ali tsopano.

He was with me to the ground.	Anali ndi ine mpaka pansi.
He is very positive.	Iye ali wotsimikiza kwambiri.
I can't sleep because of it.	Sindingathe kugona chifukwa cha izo.
I would say so.	Ndikhoza kunena choncho.
No one wanted to know anything.	Palibe amene ankafuna kudziwa kalikonse.
We must be well.	Ife tiyenera kukhala bwino.
This can be challenging.	Zimenezi zingakhale zovuta.
She is a dog.	Iye ndi galu.
I do not know.	Sindikudziwa.
You know that this is very good.	Mukudziwa kuti izi ndi zabwino kwambiri.
I don't think that's right.	Ine sindikuganiza kuti ndi zabwino.
But he could not find his way.	Koma sanathe kukhala ndi njira yake.
He does not love anyone.	Sakonda aliyense.
Whoever he is.	Aliyense iye.
He has to be.	Iye ayenera kukhala.
She is not worried.	Iye alibe nkhawa.
But with me, it’s another story.	Koma ndi ine, ndi nkhani ina.
People think a lot about other things.	Anthu amaganiza kwambiri za zinthu zina.
He should not say too much.	Sayenera kunena zambiri.
Why you should.	Chifukwa chiyani muyenera.
For the whole day.	Kwa tsiku lonse.
None of them are here with you.	Palibe mmodzi wa iwo ali pano ndi inu.
But they could not, of course not.	Koma sakanatha, ayi ndithu.
He didn't have time for that, though.	Iye analibe nthawi ya izo, ngakhale.
No one knows.	Palibe amene akudziwa.
If work is your concern.	Ngati ntchito ndi nkhawa yanu.
There were many of them.	Anali ambiri a iwo.
He was a teacher.	Iye anali mphunzitsi.
You look younger every day.	Mukuwoneka wamng'ono tsiku lililonse.
If they are, fine.	Ngati iwo ali, zabwino.
And there is a dog.	Ndipo pali galu.
He should have known that.	Iye akanayenera kudziwa zimenezo.
I probably should.	Ine mwina ndiyenera.
But there are no people.	Koma palibe anthu.
I want you to do that.	Ndikufuna kuti muchite zimenezo.
I know you are.	Ndikudziwa kuti ndiwe.
I have a job now.	Ndili ndi ntchito tsopano.
I am very happy.	Ndine wokondwa kwambiri.
People started talking.	Anthu anayamba kulankhula.
But right now.	Koma pakali pano.

And the house.	Ndipo nyumba.
My job is over now.	Ntchito yanga yatha tsopano.
He didn't know another life.	Iye sankadziwa moyo wina.
I am alive.	Ndine moyo.
Certainly.	Ndithu ndithu.
I can't talk to him though.	Sindingathe kulankhula naye ngakhale.
And maybe not.	Ndipo mwina sangathe.
And you have to do it.	Ndipo inu muyenera kuchita izo.
Or maybe there is another reason.	Kapena mwina pali chifukwa china.
Where did he go? 	Anapita kuti?
Not for everyone.	Ayi kwa aliyense.

Each player has one.	Wosewera aliyense ali ndi m'modzi.
Did he start.	Kodi iye anayamba.
Well, he's mine.	Chabwino, iye ndi wanga.
He was good to me.	Anali wabwino kwa ine.
He was her only child.	Iye anali mwana wake yekhayo.
Others need to know this.	Ena ayenera kudziwa izi.
And he was.	Ndipo iye anali.
They don't know what to do.	Iwo sakudziwa choti achite.
It's for me.	Ndi za ine.
He can't play.	Sangathe kusewera.
He was on the phone.	Anali pa foni.
Not all of them.	Si onse a iwo.
Why, why, why.	Bwanji, bwanji, bwanji.
My children love music because of this.	Ana anga amakonda nyimbo chifukwa cha zimenezi.
More on this if you need any help.	Zambiri pa izi ngati mukufuna thandizo lililonse.
You can tell him it is true.	Mutha kumuuza kuti ndi zoona.
He wanted to.	Iye ankafuna kutero.
No, right now.	Ayi, pakali pano.
Of course not!	Ayi ndithu.
But he is good.	Koma iye ndi wabwino.
But they are things.	Koma iwo ndi zinthu.
And until the whole night.	Ndipo mpaka usiku wonse.
But there is a problem.	Koma pali vuto.
He wanted his wife.	Iye ankafuna mkazi wake.
You have to go to work.	Muyenera kupita kuntchito.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Ndikukhulupirira kuti aliyense akuchita bwino.
But it was better now.	Koma zinali bwino tsopano.
Time is not the money.	Nthawi si ndalama.
It was all good.	Zinali zabwino zonse.
And until nothing good.	Ndipo mpaka palibe chabwino.
Or, in this case, you to me.	Kapena, mu nkhani iyi, inu kwa ine.
People started singing.	Anthu anayamba kuimba.
Much of it was about his work, though.	Zambiri za izo zinali za ntchito yake, ngakhale.
Now everyone has one.	Tsopano aliyense ali ndi imodzi.
He was very happy.	Iye anasangalala kwambiri.
They were not there.	Iwo sanali kumeneko.
It's a lot for us.	Ndi zambiri kwa ife.
It's a name.	Ndi dzina.
I had a family.	Ndinali ndi banja.
I hope it's over.	Ndikuyembekeza kuti watha.
This way, please.	Njira iyi, chonde.
Time, that's the problem.	Nthawi, ndiye vuto.
I am very happy with the purchase.	Ndine wokondwa kwambiri ndi kugula.
She was afraid to come in the morning.	Iye anachita mantha kubwera m'mawa.
I knew then, if they were not.	Ndinadziwa ndiye, ngati sanali ndani.
Chances are not the reason.	Mwayi si chifukwa.
And they can have a good time.	Ndipo iwo akhoza kukhala ndi nthawi yabwino.
They were eating lunch.	Iwo anali kudya chakudya chamasana.
He is with us all at this time.	Iye ndi tonse pa nthawi ino.
That was for other days.	Izo zinali za masiku ena.
It is now about noon.	Tsopano ndi pafupifupi masana.
Probably often true.	Mwina nthawi zambiri ndi zoona.
It was very difficult.	Zinali zovuta kwambiri.
You're a great man.	Ndinu munthu wamkulu.
I don’t want to live my whole life like that.	Sindikufuna kukhala moyo wanga wonse monga choncho.
That's a good reason.	Ndi chifukwa chabwino.
He knew that.	Ankadziwa bwino zimenezo.
There is nothing better than all your thoughts.	Palibe chabwino kuposa malingaliro anu onse.
This is probably your best bet.	Izi mwina ndiye njira yanu yabwino.
This is true.	Izi ndi zoona.
So he did nothing.	Choncho sanachite chilichonse.
I don't think you should, you know.	Sindikuganiza kuti muyenera, mukudziwa.
That was like yesterday to me.	Zimenezo zinali ngati dzulo kwa ine.
She is so beautiful.	Iye ndi wokongola kwambiri.
But he is not.	Koma iye sali choncho.
More on him a little.	Zambiri pa iye pang'ono.
They were scared.	Iwo anachita mantha.
I think not.	Ndikuganiza kuti sichoncho.
The dog has that.	Galu ali nazo zimenezo.
Maybe he would be fine.	Mwina angakhale bwino.
He was not much older than I am.	Sanali wamkulu kwambiri kuposa ine.
I wonder that.	Ine ndikudabwa zimenezo.
No children for me.	Palibe ana kwa ine.
Like you.	Monga inu.
There is so much to do.	Pali zambiri zoti tichite.
I wanted a wife.	Ndinkafuna mkazi.
Many people were coming.	Anthu ambiri anali kubwera.
It's great now.	Ndi wamkulu tsopano.
The story is good.	Nkhani yake ndi yabwino.
I do not like.	sindimakonda.
One time.	Nthawi ina.
I do not want more.	Sindikufuna zambiri.
Well, enough.	Chabwino, zokwanira.
But there is nobody here.	Koma palibe aliyense pano.
They don't know.	Iwo sakudziwa.
What he could have done.	Zimene akanatha kuchita.
Or if it was, no one told me.	Kapena ngati izo zinali, palibe amene anandiuza ine.
I did not know what he was talking about and he said that.	Sindimadziwa zomwe amalankhula ndipo adanena choncho.
Good man.	Munthu wabwino.
He knew about it.	Iye ankadziwa za izo.
He was amazed at what he saw.	Anadabwa ndi zimene anaona.
But he didn't care what it was, or not.	Koma iye analibe nazo ntchito zomwe izo zinali, kapena ayi.
I have my homework.	Ndili ndi homuweki.
And for how long.	Ndipo kwa nthawi yayitali bwanji.
There is no time to do anything.	Palibe nthawi yochitira chilichonse.
I need your help here.	Ndikufuna thandizo lanu pano.
But at a young age, she was a very beautiful girl.	Koma ali wamng’ono, anali mtsikana wokongola kwambiri.
Then perhaps that is what happened.	Ndiye mwina ndi zimene zinachitika.
And because he still is.	Ndipo chifukwa iye akadali.
They are not good for my family.	Sali bwino kwa banja langa.
He is not one.	Iye si mmodzi.
Many people did that.	Anthu ambiri anachita zimenezo.
But this time it was not so.	Koma nthawi ino sizinali choncho.
You have to leave.	Muyenera kuchoka.
They were happy.	Iwo anasangalala.
Everything was so good.	Zonse zinali zabwino kwambiri.
Fear for me.	Mantha chifukwa cha ine.
You have to learn everything by heart.	Muyenera kuphunzira zonse ndi mtima.
Maybe there is more.	Mwina pali zambiri.
And there are good ones.	Ndipo pali zabwino.
I'm as happy as we are.	Ndine wokondwa kwambiri monga ife.
He is the only one.	Iye ali yekha basi.
Which is.	Zomwe ndi.
I don't think of that.	Ine sindikuganiza za izo.
That was in that time.	Izo zinali mu nthawi imeneyo.
She is a good girl.	Ndi mtsikana wabwino.
He was a very good man.	Anali munthu wabwino kwambiri.
I will stay longer.	Ndikhala nthawi yayitali.
All night sometimes.	Usiku wonse nthawi zina.
That's when it happened.	Ndi pamene izo zinachitika.
I think she is very pretty.	Ndikuganiza kuti ndi wokongola kwambiri.
Maybe a little while ago.	Mwina kale pang'ono.
I can do this.	Ndikhoza kuchita izi.
But he asked.	Koma anafunsa choncho.
So far, there is no answer.	Mpaka pano, palibe yankho.
I think everyone is good.	Ndikuganiza kuti aliyense ndi wabwino.
Everyone already knows what you have to do.	Aliyense akudziwa kale kuti muyenera kuchita.
No one really knows.	Palibe amene amadziwa kwenikweni.
This is mine.	Iyi ndi yanga.
I was a boy.	Ndinali mnyamata.
Your thoughts and feelings will be better.	Maganizo anu ndi maganizo anu adzakhala bwino.
Maybe he was too.	Mwina nayenso anali.
Then there is time.	Ndiye pali nthawi.
But sometimes, that's enough.	Koma nthawi zina, ndi zokwanira.
So far, I feel better.	Mpaka pano, ndikumva bwino.
He too was hungry.	Nayenso anali ndi njala.
You know there is no other way.	Inu mukudziwa kuti palibe njira ina.
There is no other reason.	Palibe chifukwa china.
It can be very difficult.	Zingakhale zovuta kwambiri.
He stayed there for three days.	Anakhala kumeneko masiku atatu.
And go.	Ndi kupita.
No fear for me !.	Palibe mantha ine!.
That is my job.	Imeneyo ndi ntchito yanga.
They don't think.	Iwo sakuganiza.
Very good information on each of them.	Zambiri zabwino kwambiri pa aliyense wa iwo.
It's a house.	Ndi nyumba.
They wanted to tell what they had seen.	Iwo ankafuna kunena zimene anaona.
To them as they like.	Kwa iwo monga amakonda.
She was down.	Iye anali pansi.
But all the news.	Koma nkhani zonse.

I was alone in a man's house.	Ndinali ndekha kunyumba ya munthu.
So, good job.	Choncho, ntchito yabwino.
I can do that.	Ndikhoza kuchita zimenezo.
Go with everyone else.	Kupita ndi ena onse.

So that was hard for him.	Choncho zimenezo zinali zovuta kwa iye.
And that's not it.	Ndipo si zimenezo.
Or, you know.	Kapena, mukudziwa.
Of every man,.	Wa munthu aliyense,.

Only one person did.	Munthu mmodzi yekha anachita zimenezi.
He can't do that now.	Sangachite zimenezo tsopano.

She was so sure of him for that.	Iye anali wotsimikiza kwambiri za iye kwa izo.
He thought he was ready.	Iye ankaganiza kuti anali wokonzeka.
And now they know that there is none.	Ndipo tsopano iwo akudziwa kuti palibe.

We need to know who did that.	Tiyenera kudziwa amene anachita zimenezo.
He was a little boy.	Anali mnyamata wamng'ono.
Most of the time.	Nthawi zambiri.
He was.	Iye anali.
He lived his whole life here.	Anakhala moyo wake wonse kuno.
There is no saying.	Palibe kunena.

Almost like sleeping at home.	Pafupifupi ngati kugona kunyumba.

He is a big boy.	Iye ndi mnyamata wamkulu.
And that time is now.	Ndipo nthawi imeneyo ndi tsopano.

The police were terrified.	Apolisi anali ndi mantha.

With nothing to do.	Popanda china chochita.

And she was a woman.	Ndipo anali mkazi.

My beautiful wife.	Mkazi wanga wokongola.

Nobody wanted to buy those things.	Palibe amene ankafuna kugula zinthu zimenezo.
No one was with him.	Palibe amene anali naye.
One of us.	Mmodzi wa ife.
She is in school.	Ali kusukulu.

My story is my story.	Nkhani yanga ndi nkhani yanga.
But it is not !.	Koma sichoncho!.
They were amazed.	Iwo anadabwa kwambiri.
So with everyone else.	Choncho ndi ena onse.
Each of us has a role to play.	Aliyense wa ife ali ndi ntchito yake.
He has no words.	Alibe mawu.
Often a story.	Nthawi zambiri nkhani.
A lot is happening.	Zambiri zikuchitika.
She was a beautiful girl.	Anali mtsikana wokongola.
And he told me all about it.	Ndipo iye anandiuza ine zonse za izo.
Where is he going?	Akupita kuti?
People like to talk.	Anthu amakonda kulankhula.

But this does not seem to be the case.	Koma zikuoneka kuti ayi.
It was really good.	Zinali bwino ndithu.
He did not know how.	Iye sankadziwa mmene.
Well, that's all.	Chabwino, ndizo zonse.

He was doing very well.	Anali kuchita bwino kwambiri.
It's about a beautiful girl who wants to be with him.	Ndi za mtsikana wokongola yemwe akufuna kukhala naye.
Tonight is a trial.	Usikuuno ndi mlandu.
You look good, by the way.	Mukuwoneka bwino, mwa njira.
He's on something.	Iye ali pa chinachake.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Iye sankadziwa chimene iye anali kuchita.
That's good for him.	Ndi zabwino kwa iye.
He knew that he did not have to be afraid.	Iye ankadziwa kuti sayenera kuchita mantha.
No one was worried.	Palibe amene anali ndi nkhawa.
But, there is no chance with that.	Koma, palibe mwayi ndi izo.
Enough.	Zokwanira.
But he is not like that now.	Koma iye sali choncho tsopano.
I have to do it right.	Ndiyenera kuchita bwino.
Sanathe.	Sanathe.
He also had a voice.	Nayenso anali ndi mawu.
This time, no one has an answer.	Nthawi ino, palibe amene ali ndi yankho.
He probably didn't want to talk about it.	Mwina sanafune kulankhula za izo.
She was ready.	Iye anali wokonzeka.
Time is up to do so.	Nthawi yatha kutero.
All thoughts and ideas are mine.	Malingaliro ndi malingaliro onse ndi anga.
That is not true.	Zimenezo si zoona.
And you have enough music.	Ndipo muli ndi nyimbo zokwanira.
Beautiful child.	Mwana wokongola.
I heard so much about you.	Ndinamva zambiri za inu.
I had two.	Ndinali ndi awiri.

They often have stories.	Nthawi zambiri amakhala ndi nkhani.
Like us.	Monga ife.
What he wanted to say.	Zomwe ankafuna kunena.
Head teacher.	Mphunzitsi wamkulu.
I'm very sorry.	Pepani kwambiri.
So much better than me.	Zabwino kwambiri kuposa ine.
There is no way to do it.	Palibe njira yochitira izo.
But he was.	Koma iye anali.
You are the only one.	Ndinu nokha.
But we.	Koma ife.
She wanted her baby.	Ankafuna mwana wake.
Fear is an idea.	Mantha ndi lingaliro.
Good for me !.	Ndi zabwino kwa ine!.
But it's not because of me.	Koma si chifukwa cha ine.
I can be very happy with my eyes.	Ndikhoza kukhala wokondwa kwambiri ndi maso anga.
They know my name.	Iwo amadziwa dzina langa.
But I am.	Koma ndine.
That's why.	Ndi chifukwa chake.
He lives there.	Amakhala kumeneko.
That is quite a bit of money.	Imeneyo ndi ndalama ndithu.
Who is nearby.	Amene ali pafupi.
Everyone knows this is true.	Aliyense akudziwa kuti izi ndi zoona.
I have people.	Ndili ndi anthu.
And maybe true.	Ndipo mwina zoona.
It wasn't that, he thought.	Sizinali zimenezo, iye anaganiza.
All the best is that.	Zabwino zonse ndi zimenezo.
I love everyone happy.	Ndimakonda aliyense wokondwa.
But they are not.	Koma iwo sali.
But even.	Koma ngakhale.
That was certainly true.	Izo zinali zoona ndithu.
Now many are where he was.	Tsopano ambiri ali kumene iye anali.
Good for most people.	Chabwino kwa anthu ambiri.
She is young.	Iye ndi wamng'ono.
Tell his family.	Uzani banja lake.
I would like one.	Ndikufuna imodzi.
And he was.	Ndipo iye anali.
Maybe he could have known.	Mwina akanatha kudziwa.
Or he thinks he knows.	Kapena akuganiza kuti akudziwa.
I want to hear.	Ndikufuna kumva.
He must have had a car problem.	Ayenera kuti anali ndi vuto la galimoto.
You don't want to deal with those things.	Simukufuna kuchita ndi zinthu zimenezo.
This time you are lucky.	Nthawi ino muli ndi mwayi.
Many of those facts are true.	Zambiri zimenezo ndi zoona.
He may be now.	Iye akhoza kukhala tsopano.
Her husband, too.	Mwamuna wake, nayenso.
That's right.	Ndi zoona.
He said this.	Adanena izi.
I wonder about that.	Ine ndikudabwa za izo.
Always, really.	Nthawi zonse, kwenikweni.
As if it would be difficult.	Monga ngati adzakhala zovuta.
I have my kids, you know.	Ndili ndi ana anga, mukudziwa.
Very good, though.	Zabwino kwambiri, ngakhale.
He probably knew about my family.	Mwina ankadziwa za banja langa.
They have it.	Iwo amakhala ndi izo.
But, it happened.	Koma, izo zinachitika.
As a child, she wanted to help others by becoming a teacher.	Ali mwana, ankafuna kuthandiza ena mwa kukhala mphunzitsi.
Or it should be.	Kapena ayenera kukhala.
Help, among other things.	Thandizo, mwa zina.

This was a lot for me to do.	Izi zinali zambiri zoti ndichite.
She has.	Iye ali ndi.
That's very good.	Ndi bwino kwambiri.
Boy, very good.	Mnyamata, wabwino kwambiri.
Everyone knows about them.	Aliyense amadziwa za iwo.
He told me no.	Anandiuza kuti ayi.
I had no idea they would be out here.	Sindimadziwa kuti angakhale ali kunja kuno.
It was very good for me.	Zinali zabwino kwambiri kwa ine.
I do not like.	sindimakonda.
I'm sure that was fine.	Ine ndikutsimikiza izo zinali zabwino.
He was very surprised.	Anadabwa kwambiri.
So, be two.	Choncho, kukhala awiri.
I have to have what you have.	Ndiyenera kukhala ndi zomwe muli nazo.
As you well know.	Monga mukudziwa bwino.
He wanted his father.	Iye ankafuna bambo ake.
They don't seem to know what to do.	Iwo sakuwoneka kuti akudziwa choti achite.
She knows she looks good.	Amadziwa kuti akuwoneka bwino.
Maybe today then.	Mwina lero ndiye.
And really, very complicated.	Ndipo kwenikweni, zovuta kwambiri.
She looked down at him.	Iye anayang'ana pansi pa iye.
You're a woman.	Ndiwe mkazi.
There is an answer.	Pali yankho.
Right now.	Pakali pano.
You have to do this yourself.	Izi muyenera kuchita nokha.
She is too young.	Iye ndi wamng'ono kwambiri.
People are people.	Anthu ndi anthu.
My wife is the first.	Mkazi wanga ndi woyamba.
He was not afraid.	Iye sanachite mantha.
But he can.	Koma akhoza kutero.
You have to go home.	Muyenera kupita kunyumba.
Even in the works it looks good.	Ngakhale mu ntchito zikuwoneka bwino.
It really does happen.	Zikuchitika ndithu.
Or perhaps he could not.	Kapena mwina sakanatha.
He told me of his grief.	Anandiuza chisoni chake.
No one is to blame.	Palibe amene ali ndi mlandu.
I thought about things.	Ndinaganiza za zinthu.
He was one of me.	Iye anali mmodzi wa ine.
Well, maybe not.	Chabwino, mwina ayi.
But there is an answer.	Koma pali yankho.
They have so much.	Iwo ali nazo kwambiri.
And maybe that's it.	Ndipo mwina ndi zimenezo.
I can not sit.	Sindingathe kukhala.
So far she has not done what she said.	Mpaka pano sanachite zomwe ananena.
We need to sleep.	Tiyenera kugona.
He is an expert.	Iye ndi katswiri.
He's one of us, then.	Iye ndi mmodzi wa ife, ndiye.
How could they.	Iwo akanatha bwanji .
They knew this was so.	Iwo ankadziwa kuti izi zinali choncho.
I knew this.	Ndinadziwa izi.
They can be that.	Iwo akhoza kukhala zimenezo.
And they will always have a home.	Ndipo adzakhala ndi nyumba nthawi zonse.
Now you are.	Tsopano inu muli.
They are out.	Iwo ali kunja.
We are very close.	Tili pafupi kwambiri.
Like the man who was right now.	Monga munthu amene anali pakali pano.
All information.	Zambiri zonse.
All about us.	Zonse za ife.
Maybe tomorrow.	Mwina mawa.
And very interesting that he decided to do this.	Ndipo chidwi kwambiri kuti anaganiza kuchita izi.
People like to talk.	Anthu amakonda kulankhula.
It's his wife.	Ndi mkazi wake.
Then, there is the problem.	Ndiye, pali vuto.
It's your problem.	Ndi vuto lanu.
What is it.	Ndi chiyani.
Well, probably most of today.	Chabwino, mwina ambiri a lero.
Many of them.	Ambiri a iwo.
You have your time.	Muli ndi nthawi yanu.
He knew better than that.	Iye ankadziwa bwino kuposa izo.
He looked very good.	Ankawoneka bwino kwambiri.
Even him.	Ngakhale iye.
Apparently, this was not always the case.	Zikuoneka kuti nthawi zambiri sizinali choncho.
I can't work like that.	Sindingathe kugwira ntchito monga choncho.
I can do a lot with that.	Ndikhoza kuchita zambiri ndi zimenezo.
But he could.	Koma akanatha.
Some may not have.	Ena mwina sanachite zimenezi.
He is here.	Iye ali pano.
So, this happened.	Choncho, izi zinachitika.
I am.	Ndi .
He was a man.	Anali mwamuna.
Some never did that.	Ena sanachite nkomwe zimenezo.
I do not know what he is doing.	Sindikudziwa zomwe akuchita.
It's my job.	Ndi ntchito yanga.
If you know, you know.	Ngati mukudziwa, mukudziwa.
I can say more.	Ndikhoza kunena zambiri.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Pepani chifukwa anachita mantha.
Although that's a lot.	Ngakhale ndizo zambiri.
One of us, then.	Mmodzi wa ife, ndiye.
Maybe he was.	Mwina anali.
This was not about money.	Izi sizinali za ndalama.
These are.	Izi ndi.
But as a child.	Koma ngati mwana.
He seemed to know things.	Ankawoneka kuti amadziwa zinthu.
Sorry this afternoon.	Pepani masana ano.
That was for him, now.	Izo zinali kwa iye, tsopano.
I knew one.	Ndinkadziwa imodzi.
No reply.	Palibe yankho.
He did not want to give up.	Sanafune kusiya.
He wasn't there.	Iye sanali kumeneko.
I'm one person.	Ine ndine munthu mmodzi.
He must have had a reason.	Iye ayenera kuti anali ndi chifukwa.
She is a good child.	Iye ndi mwana wabwino.
I have time and money now.	Ndili ndi nthawi ndi ndalama tsopano.
We have to play well.	Tiyenera kusewera bwino.
Even today.	Ngakhale lero.
You have to.	Muyenera ku.
But that is not a new approach.	Koma imeneyo si njira yatsopano.
I didn't want to hear about it.	Sindinafune kumva za izo.
Probably not.	Mwina sizinali choncho.
I was with him today.	Ndakhala naye lero.
Or maybe.	Kapena mwina.
And there is more.	Ndipo pali zambiri.
I have been dealing with him many times.	Ndakhala ndikuchita naye nthawi zambiri.
I do not know what to do.	Sindikudziwa choti ndichite.
he thought.	iye anaganiza.
And now my parents.	Ndipo tsopano makolo anga.
I was just lucky.	Ndinali ndi mwayi basi.
Now we have to go.	Tsopano tiyenera kupita.
No, not at all.	Ayi, sichoncho ayi.
But perhaps that was so.	Koma mwina zinali choncho.
I know what.	Ndikudziwa chiyani.
Better we are.	Kulibwino ndife.
If there is no way, then maybe we should get one.	Ngati palibe njira, ndiye mwina tiyenera kupeza imodzi.
It was not what he wanted.	Sizinali zimene ankafuna.
I have one husband.	Ndili ndi mwamuna m'modzi.
It was good.	Zinali zabwino.
Probably so.	Mwina zinali choncho.
Every one of them is still around.	Aliyense wa iwo akadali pafupi.
Every one of you.	Aliyense wa inu.
Things were that for us.	Zinthu zinali choncho kwa ife.
.	.
No problem.	Palibe vuto.
I don't think anything else.	sindikuganiza china chilichonse.
This is for you.	Izi ndi za inu.
Probably because of his beautiful wife.	Mwina chifukwa cha mkazi wake wokongola.
But fear was in him.	Koma mantha anali mwa iye.
They wanted to talk to someone.	Iwo ankafuna kulankhula ndi winawake.
He was down.	Anali pansi.
In his house.	Mu nyumba yake.
But the child is interested and ready now.	Koma mwana ali ndi chidwi ndi wokonzeka tsopano.
His favorite food.	Chakudya chake chomwe amakonda.
This is what it was.	Izi ndi zomwe zinali.
He should play like that.	Ayenera kusewera monga choncho.
But now I love it.	Koma tsopano ndimakonda.
This is for children.	Izi ndi za ana.
I want to spend the night alone.	Ndikufuna usiku wonse ndekha.
Well, he or someone else.	Chabwino, iye kapena winawake.
Someone could do something.	Winawake akanatha kuchita chinachake.
He expected it to be so.	Iye ankayembekezera kuti zinali choncho.
I have nothing to do.	Ndilibe china choti ndichite.
I have a lot to do.	Ndili ndi zambiri zoti ndichite.
Now.	Tsopano.
That's what they did.	Ndi chimene iwo anachita.
It's my opinion.	Ndi maganizo anga.
I have to stop doing that.	Ine ndiyenera kusiya kuchita zimenezo.
But, really, this was good.	Koma, kwenikweni, izi zinali bwino.
He did not know who his father was.	Iye sankadziwa yemwe anali bambo ake.
Money, money, money.	Ndalama, ndalama, ndalama.
It was great !.	Zinali zabwino!.
This was not the case with us.	Izi sizinali choncho ndi ife.
And maybe, sometimes, they do more than that.	Ndipo mwina, nthawi zina, amachita zambiri kuposa izo.
They were people.	Iwo anali anthu.
This is what I want.	Izi ndi zomwe ndikufuna.
But that is not really the case.	Koma kwenikweni sichoncho.
But more than anything.	Koma kuposa chilichonse.
And sometimes it does.	Ndipo nthawi zina kutero.
Maybe he was already here.	Mwina anali kale pano.
All true.	Zonse zoona.
That's all.	Ndizo zonse.
There is another.	Pali wina.
What you think you should do.	Zomwe mukuganiza kuti muyenera kuchita.
They had been around for a long time.	Iwo anali ali pafupi kwa nthawi yaitali.
Many will be there just like you.	Ambiri adzakhala kumeneko monga inu.
What you are.	Chimene inu muli.
He said we should do it together.	Anati tichite limodzi.
This is very good.	Izi ndi zabwino kwambiri.
Good boy.	Mwana wabwino.
What.	Kodi.
I want to say something.	Ndikufuna kunena china chake.
He is not one of them.	Iye si mmodzi wa iwo.
If it is.	Ngati ndi.
But that was not the case.	Koma sizinali choncho.
Your father probably expected more of you.	Bambo anu ayenera kuti ankayembekezera zambiri kwa inu.
If not, then when ?.	Ngati sichoncho, ndiye liti?.
I can never know for sure.	Sindingathe kudziwa bwino izi.
That's what he likes.	Ndizo zomwe amakonda.
He told me a good story.	Anandiuza nkhani yabwino.
Alcohol, to say the least.	Mowa, kunena.
But he was not a child.	Koma sanali mwana.
I had no idea how to do that.	Sindinkadziwa njira ina yochitira zimenezo.
But to him it was not so.	Koma kwa iye sizinali choncho.
.	.
That's what they did, and that was it.	Ndi zomwe iwo anachita, ndipo izo zinali izo.
Although he was alone, they were impressed.	Ngakhale kuti anali yekha, anachita chidwi.
People like us.	Anthu ngati ife.
More about that, please.	Zambiri za izo, chonde.
But that was not all.	Koma sizinali zonse.
This is not my job.	Iyi si ntchito yanga.
I can't work.	Sindingathe kugwira ntchito.
In the past it was not so.	Kale sizinali choncho.
Pa, pa, pa.	Pa, pa, pa.
It was very difficult.	Zinali zovuta kwambiri.
But you have to leave.	Koma muyenera kuchoka.
Maybe.	Mwina.
Things are a way.	Zinthu ndi njira.
Because everybody else was doing it.	Chifukwa wina aliyense anali kuchita izo.
I think there is more to it than that.	Ine ndikuganiza pali zambiri kwa izo kuposa izo.
This is true.	Izi ndi zoona.
It seems so.	Zikuwoneka choncho.
This was not always the case.	Izi sizinali choncho nthawi zambiri.
He looked at his phone in horror.	Anayang'ana foni yake ndi mantha.
In due course.	Pa nthawi yake.
Or it was like.	Kapena zinali ngati.
I have no problem with it.	Ndilibe vuto nazo.
There is no time to do that.	Palibe nthawi yochitira zimenezo.
I'm going to a party.	Ndikupita kuphwando.
And that was it.	Ndipo izo zinali.
She has been good to me.	Iye wakhala wabwino kwa ine.
But it is not a problem.	Koma si vuto.
I have my own house.	Ndili ndi nyumba yanga.
He has no car.	Alibe galimoto.
My thoughts are still mine.	Malingaliro anga akadali anga.
They don't even know, maybe, that you have a wife.	Iwo sakudziwa nkomwe, mwina, kuti muli ndi mkazi.
They do not live.	Sakhala ndi moyo.
She had him now.	Iye anali naye iye tsopano.
This should be done.	Izi ayenera kuchita.
Times were hard for everyone.	Nthawi zinali zovuta kwa aliyense.
As he should.	Monga iye ayenera.
Outside.	Kunja.
But who knows.	Koma ndani akudziwa.
She is doing well.	Iye akuchita bwino.
Most of the time.	Nthawi zambiri.
I have been doing this for many years.	Ndakhala ndikuchita izi kwa zaka zambiri.
She looked very pretty on something.	Iye ankawoneka wokongola kwambiri pa chinachake.
But not all.	Koma si onse.
He did not want to know.	Iye sankafuna kudziwa.
They were not all there.	Sanali onse kumeneko.
They don't know about me.	Sakudziwa za ine.
House.	Nyumba.
So far everything looks good.	Mpaka pano zonse zikuwoneka bwino.
He is not yours.	Iye si wanu.
So good things.	Choncho zinthu zabwino.
he wonders.	anadabwa.
Then it is near.	Ndiye ndi pafupi .
Sorry, but it is.	Pepani, koma ali.
How did that happen? 	Kodi zimenezi zinachitika bwanji?
But for me.	Koma kwa ine.
This is not a new approach.	Iyi si njira yatsopano.
We have to play well.	Tiyenera kusewera bwino.
That is not a car.	Imeneyo si galimoto.
Well, we can't really.	Chabwino, sitingathe kwenikweni.
I knew it now or not.	Ndinadziwa kuti tsopano kapena ayi.
No one could.	Palibe amene akanatha.
Things were not like that.	Zinthu sizinali choncho.
It wasn't too hard.	Sizinali zovuta kwambiri.
And he knew.	Ndipo iye ankadziwa.
All the best.	Zabwino zonse.
We cannot do this.	Sitingathe kuchita izi.
It's my wife.	Ndi mkazi wanga.
But he.	Koma iye.
I was just.	Ine ndinali basi.
He began to do so.	Iye anayamba kutero.
He enjoyed it.	Iye anasangalala nazo.
If not today, then tomorrow.	Ngati si lero, ndiye mawa.
It was always like this.	Zinali chonchi nthawi zonse.
It was good that he did.	Zinali bwino kuti anachita.
But I think so.	Koma ndikuganiza choncho.
I did not want to go.	Sindinafune kupita.
You have to come.	Muyenera kubwera.
And her baby.	Ndipo mwana wake.
But nobody said that.	Koma palibe amene ananena zimenezo.
You need more.	Muyenera zambiri.
By now, everyone knew why.	Pakali pano, aliyense ankadziwa chifukwa chake.
But, he is a little boy and you are his teacher.	Koma, iye ndi mwana wamng'ono ndipo inu ndinu mphunzitsi wake.
There is more this week.	Pali zambiri sabata ino.
Some of them are good, some are not.	Zina mwa izo ndi zabwino, zina si zabwino.
But he apparently did not do so.	Koma zikuoneka kuti sanachite zimenezi.
I wanted to live.	Ndinkafuna kukhala ndi moyo.
You have to have music.	Muyenera kukhala ndi nyimbo.
Now it's mine.	Tsopano ndi yanga.
People did not do that.	Anthu sanali kuchita zimenezo.
They should be.	Iwo ayenera kukhala.
He was waiting for an answer.	Iye ankayembekezera yankho.
It's a long time.	Ndi nthawi yayitali.
I have to do it for myself.	Ndiyenera kutero kwa ine.
I am he.	Ine ndine iye.
Dad came home.	Bambo anabwera kunyumba.
Is this true ?.	Ndi zoona izi?.
That seems like a lot.	Izo zikuwoneka ngati zambiri.
He didn't know what to do.	Iye sankadziwa choti achite.
Right away, really.	Nthawi yomweyo, kwenikweni.
We have so many things like that.	Tili ndi zinthu zambiri monga choncho.
But one has to say these things.	Koma wina ayenera kunena zinthu izi.
That's very good, then just me.	Ndizo zabwino kwambiri, ndiye basi ine.
He was my father.	Anali bambo anga.
One can tell him anything.	Munthu akhoza kumuuza chilichonse.
They did a really good job.	Iwo anachita ntchito yabwino kwenikweni.
You are mine.	Ndiwe wanga.
But there are not many options.	Koma palibe njira zambiri.
Well, more than anything.	Chabwino, kuposa chilichonse.
I do not want to be.	Sindikufuna kukhala.
But that time is not available.	Koma nthawi imeneyo palibe.
You should hear more about this soon.	Muyenera kumva zambiri za izi posachedwa.
Do you have any ideas for that.	Kodi muli ndi lingaliro lililonse pa izo.
He wanted to go to work.	Iye ankafuna kupita kuntchito.
I was lucky.	Ndinali ndi mwayi.
Although this was difficult.	Ngakhale izi zinali zovuta.
I can help.	Ndikhoza kuthandiza.
All that.	Zonse izo.
You're sure.	Ndinu wotsimikiza.
He was good.	Iye anali wabwino.
Every day there are many challenges.	Tsiku ndi tsiku pali zovuta zambiri.
No one is what they look like.	Palibe amene sali chomwe akuwoneka.
It's really good.	Ndi zabwino kwenikweni.
Dinner.	Chakudya chamadzulo.
It was good for him.	Zinali zabwino kwa iye.
It was hard to know.	Zinali zovuta kudziwa.
And more.	Ndipo zambiri.
Some days it is like that.	Masiku ena amakhala choncho.
As they are at that time.	Monga iwo ali pa nthawi imeneyo.
But if not.	Koma ngati sichoncho.
And a lot more.	Ndi zambiri zambiri.
Many people do that.	Anthu ambiri amachita zimenezo.

It was as if he did not know.	Zinali ngati sakudziwa.

Maybe that's not good.	Mwina si zabwino zimenezo.
As human beings.	Monga anthu.
It happened for nothing.	Zinachitika popanda kanthu.
But here's the idea.	Koma lingaliro ndi ili.
I was always hungry.	Ndinali ndi njala nthawi zonse.
No time.	Palibe nthawi.
Some issues are, or are all.	Nkhani zina ndi, kapena ndi zonse.

You want to feel ready.	Mukufuna kumva wokonzeka.
And they went to somebody else.	Ndipo iwo anapita kwa munthu wina.

It is a success for everyone.	Ndi kupambana kwa aliyense.
He is a good man who knows his job.	Ndi munthu wabwino amene amadziwa ntchito yake.

You have to drive.	Muyenera kuyendetsa.

And he was doing it.	Ndipo iye anali kuchita izo.

There is no individual.	Palibe munthu payekha.
But this can be tricky.	Koma izi zingakhale zovuta.
None of them said much.	Palibe mmodzi wa iwo amene ananena zambiri.

In most cases, there is no time.	Nthawi zambiri, palibe nthawi.
You need to feel good about this.	Muyenera kumva bwino pa izi.
You have many years in you.	Muli ndi zaka zambiri mwa inu.

This is what you need to do.	Izi ndi zomwe muyenera kuchita.
He didn't even have it.	Iye analibe nkomwe.
This is more than that.	Izi ndi zambiri kuposa izo.

Or, one was.	Kapena, mmodzi anali.
Of course not!	Ayi ndithu.

For a long time.	Kwa nthawi yayitali.
He doesn't have to.	Iye sayenera kutero.

He thought they looked good.	Iye ankaganiza kuti iwo ankawoneka bwino.
They do it all the time.	Iwo amachita izo nthawi zonse.

Everything else was just what he could have been.	Zina zonse zinali zimene akanatha kukhala.

There is nothing good that he seems to have.	Palibe zabwino zomwe akuwoneka kuti ali nazo.
This is true.	Izi ndi zoona.
This is what he wants.	Izi ndi zomwe akufuna.
But he was not one of them.	Koma iye sanali mmodzi wa iwo.

He was terrified.	Anachita mantha kwambiri.

He is not a man of the house.	Iye si munthu wa nyumba.
This is all he does.	Izi ndi zonse zomwe amachita.
Almost human.	Pafupifupi munthu.

And for each one of you, there are three persons.	Ndi aliyense wa inu, pali anthu atatu.

And he was not alone.	Ndipo sanali yekha.

And there is no other reason.	Ndipo palibe chifukwa china chake.
Playing with me, they were.	Kusewera ndi ine, iwo anali.
He probably did not have time.	Mwina analibe nthawi .
He was the first.	Iye anali woyamba.
Work, work.	Ntchito, ntchito.

He does not like to live here.	Sakonda kukhala kuno.

Just in time.	Pa nthawi yake basi.
He is the one who seems to be.	Iye ndi amene akuwoneka kuti ali.

And although not all.	Ndipo ngakhale si onse.

They all had money.	Onse anali ndi ndalama.
Some have a lot of work.	Zina ndi ntchito zambiri.
Maybe buy something.	Mwina kugula chinachake.
Or you need help.	Kapena mukufuna thandizo.
Some people have more money than others.	Anthu ena amakhala ndi ndalama zambiri kuposa ena.
That's just fine.	Ndizo zabwino basi.
You are like.	Muli ngati .
He can drive home.	Amatha kuyendetsa galimoto kunyumba.

Little by little.	Pang'ono ndi pang'ono.
It could be you.	Mutha kukhala inu.
They are not here.	Iwo sali pano.
He is not good.	Iye si wabwino.
You have to be that way.	Muyenera kukhala choncho.
Because it was me, myself.	Chifukwa ndinali ine, ine ndekha.
Everyone wanted to be with him.	Aliyense ankafuna kukhala naye.
It was really good.	Zinali zabwino kwenikweni.
Days and days.	Masiku ndi masiku.
But soon.	Koma posachedwa.

I was happy to talk to him.	Ndinali wokondwa kulankhula naye.
She is worried.	Ali ndi nkhawa.

He was worried all night.	Anakhala ndi nkhawa usiku wonse.
I'm doing a really good job.	Ndikuchita ntchito yabwino kwambiri.
They are very scared.	Iwo anachita mantha kwambiri.

They all had a great time.	Onse anali ndi nthawi yabwino.
Alcohol and everything.	Mowa ndi chilichonse.

I'm not that young.	Ine sindine wamng'ono chonchi.
Or even more complicated.	Kapena ngakhale zovuta kwambiri.
But that is not why we are here.	Koma si chifukwa chake tili pano.
He was a man, he was a woman.	Iye anali mwamuna, iye anali mkazi.
But there is a reason.	Koma pali chifukwa.
None of these methods are ideal.	Palibe mwa njira izi yomwe ili yabwino.
And by all means, everyone should.	Ndipo mwa njira zonse, aliyense ayenera.
I need one here.	Ndikufuna wina pano.

So no one wanted to talk to us.	Choncho palibe amene ankafuna kulankhula nafe.
His work is not good.	Ntchito yake si yabwino.
Many did not do well.	Ambiri sanachite bwino.
He was sure they were close.	Iye anali wotsimikiza kuti iwo anali pafupi.
That's the reason.	Ndicho chifukwa chake.
Maybe it was money.	Mwina zinali ndalama.
In, as, a day.	Mu, monga, tsiku.
She did not want to talk to him on the phone.	Sanafune kulankhula naye pa foni.
This is a very long time.	Iyi ndi nthawi yayitali kwambiri.

I know how to be close to a man.	Ndikudziwa kukhala pafupi ndi mwamuna.
I do not know what it is.	Sindikudziwa kuti ndi chiyani.
It's not a fear, but a way.	Si mantha, koma njira.
He has his mind and his heart.	Ali ndi maganizo ndi mtima wake.
Now I really like it.	Tsopano ndimakonda kwambiri.
That's good enough.	Ndizo zabwino mokwanira.

And these are very good times.	Ndipo izi ndi nthawi zabwino kwambiri.
Or eat you.	Kapena kudya inu.

It was probably the police.	Mwina anali apolisi.
Like that.	Monga choncho.
Nothing about my baby.	Palibe za mwana wanga.
He was on something.	Iye anali pa chinachake.
That's a good reason.	Ndi chifukwa chabwino.
He is not your concern.	Iye si nkhawa yanu.
And you should go to the doctor.	Ndipo muyenera kupita kwa dokotala.

It looks like that.	Izo zikuwoneka ngati za izo.
You cannot do this on your own.	Simungathe kuchita izi nokha.
He had no words at all.	Analibe mawu nkomwe.
I have to be very happy.	Ndiyenera kukhala wokondwa kwambiri.
Some live with us.	Ena amakhala nafe.
They came very close this time.	Iwo anabwera pafupi kwambiri nthawi ino.
Of course not!	Ayi ndithu.
It was not enough.	Sizinali zokwanira.
So there is another way.	Choncho pali njira ina.
More than that, he is a great teacher.	Kuposa izi, iye ndi mphunzitsi wamkulu.
But that was not the case.	Koma sizinali choncho.
It's not you.	Si inu.
They often do a lot.	Nthawi zambiri amachita zambiri.
A little better.	Zabwino pang'ono.
He almost had a heart attack.	Pafupifupi anali ndi vuto la mtima.
And he has no life.	Ndipo alibe moyo.
We can never.	Sitingathe konse.
But even this was difficult.	Koma ngakhale izi zinali zovuta.
Life is good.	Moyo ndi wabwino.
We have a day.	Tili ndi tsiku.
And he was not the only one who said that.	Ndipo si iye yekha amene ananena izo.
He did it enough.	Iye anachita izo mokwanira.
And really no problem.	Ndipo kwenikweni palibe vuto.

At night there is no departure from it at all.	Usiku palibe kuchoka kwa izo nkomwe.
He knows where he lives.	Amadziwa komwe amakhala.
He doesn't know where he is at.	Iye sakudziwa kumene iye ali.
You need to find out more about it.	Muyenera kupeza zambiri za izo.

That was true last night.	Izo zinali zoona usiku watha.
Many things.	Zinthu zambiri.
He is not happy.	Sali wokondwa.

You have to play well.	Muyenera kusewera bwino.
He already knows about it.	Iye akudziwa kale za izo.

And she is happy, and she is afraid.	Ndipo ali wokondwa, akuchita mantha.
And that's all of it.	Ndipo ndizo zonse za izo.
He said he was.	Iye anati anali.
They have to catch something.	Iwo ayenera kugwira chinachake.
They were fine without them.	Anali bwino popanda iwo.
He is innocent.	Iye alibe mlandu.
He seems to know a lot.	Akuwoneka kuti akudziwa zambiri.
This is not a good option.	Iyi si njira yabwino.
Maybe he can too.	Mwina nayenso akhoza kutero.
And that's really about it.	Ndipo kwenikweni ndizo za izo.
He was a very good doctor.	Iye anali dokotala wabwino kwambiri.
But maybe it was okay.	Koma mwina zinali bwino.
You, or someone like you.	Inu, kapena wina ngati inu.
They don't seem to be there.	Iwo sakuwoneka kuti ali kumeneko.
At one point it was enough.	Pa nthawi ina zinali zokwanira.

Good teacher.	Mphunzitsi wabwino.
She was too young.	Iye anali wamng'ono kwambiri.
And, you know, he's better than us.	Ndipo, mukudziwa, ali bwino kuposa ife.
Or so people thought.	Kapena anthu ankaganiza choncho.
But that was not the case.	Koma sizinali choncho.
And he did.	Ndipo iye anachita.

Or I had three children of mine.	Kapena ndinali ndi ana anga atatu.
Time and time again.	Nthawi ndi nthawi.
Everyone is so good.	Aliyense ali bwino kwambiri.
You want to have children.	Mukufuna kukhala ndi ana.
He also knew the way.	Nayenso ankadziwa njira.
You can stay at home.	Mutha kukhala kunyumba.
Which was great.	Zomwe zinali zabwino.
Without doing anything.	Popanda kuchita kalikonse.
That's what an adult should do.	Ndicho chimene munthu wamkulu ayenera kuchita.
Here, my life is mine.	Pano, moyo wanga ndi wanga.
He was terrified.	Anachita mantha kwambiri.
People say that.	Anthu akunena izo.
Although, today.	Ngakhale, lero .
That's what he was here for.	Ndi chimene iye anali kuno.
Only one this time, a girl.	Mmodzi yekha nthawi iyi, mtsikana.
You can quit your job.	Mutha kusiya ntchito yanu.
And he had all the alcohol.	Ndipo anali ndi mowa wonse.
None to.	Palibe ku.
No, they could not.	Ayi, sakanatha.
It happened yesterday.	Zinachitika dzulo.
And to my parents.	Ndipo kwa makolo anga.
He wasn't doing anything right now.	Iye sanali kuchita kalikonse pakali pano.
She is very good.	Iye ndi wabwino kwambiri.
For the rest of my life.	Kwa moyo wanga wonse.
But not many people.	Koma si anthu ambiri.
I need to talk to him too.	Ndiyenera kulankhula nayenso.
I don't want that for myself.	Sindikufuna zimenezo kwa ine ndekha.
But there is more on the horizon.	Koma pali zambiri zimene zikuchitika.
Some must have realized that.	Ena ayenera kuti anazindikira.
But sometimes it is better to leave.	Koma nthawi zina ndi bwino kuchoka.
I'm hungry.	Ndikumva njala.
At the same time almost.	Pa nthawi yomweyo pafupifupi.
More about us here.	Zambiri za ife pano.
Every one of them.	Aliyense wa iwo.
That's it, but it's more.	Ndi zimenezo, koma ndi zambiri.
Well, that's what he does.	Chabwino, ndi zomwe amachita.
He will be fine.	Adzakhala wabwino.
They are my family.	Iwo ndi banja langa.
I'm not a big player.	Sindine wosewera wamkulu.
And that is not what he is saying.	Ndipo si zimene akunena.
Living with her boyfriend.	Kukhala ndi bwenzi lake.
We cannot do it alone.	Sitingathe kuchita tokha.
His parents had money.	Makolo ake anali ndi ndalama.
But it was not good.	Koma sizinali bwino.
No, it is not.	Ayi, sichoncho.
And he knows he knows.	Ndipo akudziwa kuti akudziwa.
He says he is too young to have many children.	Akuti ali wamng'ono kwambiri ndipo angafune ana ambiri.
He had many friends there.	Anali ndi anzake ambiri kumeneko.
What a wonderful thing about her!	Ndi zabwino bwanji za iye!
It happened so fast.	Zinachitika mofulumira kwambiri.
You are the only one to me.	Ndinu nokha kwa ine.
I hope today is good for you.	Ndikukhulupirira kuti lero ndi zabwino kwa inu.
He did not know what he was thinking.	Iye sankadziwa zimene ankaganiza.
Word, word, word.	Mawu, mawu, mawu.
But they could not stay with him.	Koma sakanatha kukhala naye.
He can have his time.	Iye akhoza kukhala ndi nthawi yake.
Perhaps he hoped to do so.	Mwina ankayembekezera zimenezi.
And to have good things.	Ndipo kukhala ndi zinthu zabwino.
That would be great.	Zingakhale zabwino.
He was like that.	Anali choncho .
I was curious.	Ndinali ndi chidwi.
One way to do this.	Njira imodzi yochitira izi.
My father was shocked.	Bambo anga anadabwa kwambiri.
Apparently he did not.	Zikuoneka kuti sanachite zimenezo.
Lots of money.	Ndalama zambiri.
This was not the case.	Zimenezi sizinali choncho kwenikweni.
It looks really good.	Zikuwoneka bwino kwambiri.
He knew a lot.	Iye ankadziwa zambiri.
I have enough.	Ndili nazo zokwanira.
He lives to talk about life.	Iye amakhala ndi moyo kulankhula za moyo.
But they don't know it.	Koma iwo sakudziwa izo.
If he could not do it, he had no money.	Ngati sakanatha kuchita, analibe ndalama.
He was very happy.	Anasangalala kwambiri.
Probably no problem.	Mwina palibe vuto.
They were his life.	Iwo anali moyo wake.
It's one of my eyes.	Ndi limodzi mwa maso anga.
I heard all about it.	Ndinamva zonse za izo.
I want to be a good husband and father.	Ndikufuna kukhala mwamuna ndi bambo wabwino.
She was scared.	Anali ndi mantha.
People do things like that.	Anthu amachita zinthu ngati zimenezo.
That's what he wanted.	Ndi zomwe ankafuna.
Music is the food of life.	Nyimbo ndi chakudya cha moyo.
I was in school.	Ndinali kusukulu.
They said they were very interested.	Iwo ananena kuti anali ndi chidwi kwambiri.
This was probably a good thing.	Izi mwina zinali zabwino.
He knew what it was.	Iye ankadziwa chimene izo zinali.
He did very well.	Anachita bwino kwambiri.
She is too young.	Iye ndi wamng'ono kwambiri.
And they went to somebody else.	Ndipo iwo anapita kwa munthu wina.
No one knew.	Palibe amene ankadziwa.
I feel ready to go.	Ndikumva wokonzeka kupita.
No one has a problem with that.	Palibe amene ali ndi vuto ndi zimenezo.
I had it all.	Ndinali nazo zonse.
I have to work.	Ndiyenera kugwira ntchito.
It was like a family.	Zinali ngati banja.
Well, we can't.	Chabwino, sitingathe.
But this is not true.	Koma izi si zoona.
Today in the time of.	Lero mu nthawi ya.
He thought so.	Iye ankaganiza choncho.
You can do nothing and do good.	Simungathe kuchita chilichonse ndikuchita zabwino.
He lived with his parents.	Anakhala ndi makolo ake.
As he knew something about her now.	Monga iye ankadziwa chinachake za iye tsopano.
He didn't just want to say.	Sanafune kunena basi.
Many of them have done that.	Ambiri a iwo achita zimenezo.
Your husband will be fine.	Mwamuna wanu adzakhala bwino.
Most people can do that.	Anthu ambiri akhoza kuchita zimenezo.
Good reason.	Chifukwa chabwino.
She had a heart attack.	Iye anali ndi vuto la mtima.
But he tried.	Koma anayesa.
He is a good man.	Ndi munthu wabwino.
That is what people need now.	Zomwe ndi zomwe anthu akuyenera tsopano.
Nobody can do anything.	Palibe munthu amene angachite chilichonse.
He had a way with people.	Anali ndi njira ndi anthu.
And all the best to them.	Ndipo zabwino zonse kwa iwo.
That's good for it.	Ndi zabwino kwa izo.
Which would be nice.	Zomwe zingakhale zabwino.
If we are lucky.	Ngati tili ndi mwayi.
There is so much to do.	Pali zambiri zoti tichite.
She's a busy, busy girl.	Iye ndi mtsikana wotanganidwa, wotanganidwa.
It's all your fault.	Zonse ndi vuto lanu.
But this was not always the case.	Koma sizinali choncho nthawi zonse.
It is a very difficult task.	Ndi ntchito zovuta kwambiri.
I could not sleep or work.	Sindinathe kugona kapena kugwira ntchito.
He is not happy.	Sali wokondwa.
I feel alone.	Ndikumva ndekha.
It happened so fast.	Zinachitika mofulumira kwambiri.
He is still here.	Iye akadali pano.
It was hard to find.	Zinali zovuta kupeza.
Nothing more.	Palibe zambiri.
I'm so sorry then.	Ndikumva chisoni kwambiri ndiye.

We must go now.	Ife tiyenera kupita tsopano.
He looked at me.	Iye anayang'ana pa ine.
He can work with his mind.	Amatha kugwira ntchito ndi malingaliro ake.
Probably no one noticed.	Mwina palibe amene anazindikira.
I heard his voice.	Ndinamva mawu ake.
You should always be first.	Muyenera kukhala woyamba nthawi zonse.
The evening is mine.	Madzulo ndi anga.

Because it is so good for my life.	Chifukwa ndi zabwino kwambiri kwa moyo wanga.

He stayed up all night.	Anakhala usiku wonse.
It was a lot.	Zinali zambiri.
Something you need to do more.	Chinachake muyenera kuchita zambiri.
You can live a good life on your own.	Mutha kukhala ndi moyo wabwino nokha.
I do not want to go right now.	Sindikufuna kupita pakali pano.
Until another time.	Mpaka nthawi ina.
I don't think she's scared.	sindikuganiza kuti akuchita mantha.
I know what you should be thinking.	Ndikudziwa zomwe muyenera kukhala mukuganiza.
If so.	Ngati ndi liti.
He is innocent.	Iye alibe mlandu.
You cannot live.	Simungathe kukhala ndi moyo.
Or maybe I am.	Kapena mwina ndine.
Your dog should not be near you.	Galu wanu sayenera kukhala pafupi ndi inu.
This was hard to know.	Izi zinali zovuta kudziwa.
I have no idea.	Ndilibe lingaliro.
Being alone is not a problem for me.	Kukhala ndekha si vuto kwa ine.
I really want to learn.	Ndikufuna kwambiri kuphunzira.
They are not guilty though.	Iwo alibe mlandu ngakhale.
And maybe my baby.	Ndipo mwina mwana wanga.
He can say whatever he wants.	Amatha kunena chilichonse chomwe angafune.
Well, it was like that.	Chabwino, izo zinali ngati choncho.
This is a good way.	Iyi ndi njira yabwino.
They were there yesterday.	Iwo anali kumeneko dzulo.
Or work, really.	Kapena ntchito, kwenikweni.
When you really can't do that.	Pamene kwenikweni simungathe kuchita zimenezo.
It is an individual.	Ndi munthu payekha.
And who is with him.	Ndipo amene ali naye.
There are so many ideas.	Pali malingaliro ambiri.
There is a very good reason for this.	Pali chifukwa chabwino kwambiri cha izi.
And now he was on the subject.	Ndipo tsopano iye anali pa nkhani.
He was lucky.	Iye anali ndi mwayi.
No, no.	Ayi, ayi.
My father is not like that at all.	Bambo anga sali choncho nkomwe.
He was my man.	Iye anali munthu wanga.
About his disciple.	Za wophunzira wake.
I'm just him.	Ine ndi iye basi.

Success is.	Kupambana ndi.
I didn't know that.	Ine sindimadziwa zimenezo.
Even him.	Ngakhale iye.
I'm one of you.	Ndine mmodzi wa inu.
But that was not the case now.	Koma sizinali choncho tsopano.
But this is not true.	Koma zimenezi si zoona.
They looked good.	Iwo ankawoneka bwino.
There is a problem with the method.	Pali vuto la njira.
I have lived my own life.	Ndakhala moyo wanga ndekha.
I don't want to do that.	Ine sindikufuna kuchita izo.
But all was well.	Koma zonse zinali bwino.
Even if you are a woman.	Ngakhale ndiwe mkazi.
He stayed up during the day.	Anakhala masana.
They could not last a day.	Iwo sakanatha tsiku.
It is a daily activity.	Ndi ntchito ya tsiku ndi tsiku.
That's great.	Ndi zabwino kwambiri.
But they were there.	Koma iwo anali kumeneko.
He told me about it.	Iye anandiuza ine za izo.
He knows this is his problem.	Amadziwa kuti ili ndi vuto lake.
I feel good already.	Ndikumva bwino kale.
That was all.	Izo zinali zonse.
So, no problem.	Choncho, palibe vuto.
Maybe a man.	Mwina mwamuna.
From one job to another.	Kuchokera ku ntchito ina kupita ku ina.
He did not want to stay with me.	Sanafune kukhala ndi ine.
But I am the only one.	Koma ndi ine ndekha.
His father was not.	Bambo ake analibe.
And they want to do better at this.	Ndipo iwo akufuna kuchita bwino pa izi.
They are individuals.	Iwo ndi munthu payekha.
That's all he is.	Ndizo zonse zomwe iye ali.
All will have an opinion on it.	Onse adzakhala ndi maganizo pa izo.
I think they should.	Ine ndikuganiza iwo ayenera.
None of us live alone.	Palibe aliyense wa ife amene amakhala yekha.
I'm glad you're beautiful.	Ndine wokondwa kuti ndinu wokongola.
They're going too fast.	Iwo akupita mofulumira kwambiri.
He wasn't sure.	Sanali wotsimikiza.
They're all on it.	Iwo ali onse pa izo.
How to learn.	Momwe muyenera kuphunzira.
There is no one around.	Palibe wina pafupi.
He has one.	Ali ndi wina.
Even taking him to school.	Ngakhale kupita naye kusukulu.
But in this case.	Koma mu nkhani iyi .
He did not want to stay here.	Sanafune kukhala pano.
He was.	Iye anali.
My father was a great man.	Bambo anga anali munthu wamkulu.
They are not his.	Iwo si ake.
And no one knows that.	Ndipo palibe amene akudziwa zimenezo.
You want to know why.	Mukufuna kudziwa chifukwa chake.
And today, he thought.	Ndi lero, iye anaganiza.
Sorry, everyone.	Pepani, aliyense.
He was very worried.	Anali ndi nkhawa zambiri.
No one looked at anyone else.	Palibe amene anayang'ana wina aliyense.
The work of his life.	Ntchito ya moyo wake.
Almost everyone is scared of him.	Pafupifupi aliyense akuchita mantha naye.
To your people.	Kwa anthu anu.
He did that, you know.	Iye anachita izo, inu mukudziwa.
Are you the one who said, and nothing.	Kodi ndinu mmodzi ananena, ndipo palibe kanthu.
No one knows everything.	Palibe amene amadziwa zonse.
Everything was so good.	Zonse zinali zabwino kwambiri.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Sindingathe, sindingathe, sindingathe.
I do not know enough about this subject.	Sindikudziwa mokwanira za nkhaniyi.
No one else could.	Palibe wina aliyense amene akanatha.
I love people.	Ndimakonda anthu.
All thoughts and ideas are mine.	Malingaliro ndi malingaliro onse ndi anga.
And for good reason.	Ndipo ndi chifukwa chabwino.
He had to go.	Iye akanayenera kupita.
You know, if you want to.	Mukudziwa, ngati mukufuna.
I thought you were.	Ndimaganiza kuti muli.
Human life is.	Moyo wa munthu ndi.
I could not figure out what he did.	Sindinathe kudziwa zomwe anachita.
I don't know what it looks like.	Sindikudziwa kuti zikuwoneka bwanji.
They were, really, a lot.	Iwo anali, kwenikweni, zambiri.
He communicates with people every day.	Iye amalankhula ndi anthu tsiku lililonse.
But this was not always the case.	Koma sizinali choncho nthawi zonse.
He did not want to do schoolwork.	Sanafune kugwira ntchito za kusukulu.
No, not at all.	Ayi, sichoncho ayi.
He had no reason to do so.	Iye analibe chifukwa kutero.
Sometimes they can't.	Nthawi zina sangathe.
That's why he was here.	N’chifukwa chake anali kuno.
And now the answer is very, very strong.	Ndipo tsopano yankho kwambiri kwambiri.
But maybe not.	Koma mwina ayi.
And there is another reason.	Ndipo pali chifukwa china.
I know from my own child.	Ndikudziwa kuchokera kwa mwana wanga yemwe.
But she was happy to be at home.	Koma anasangalala kukhala kunyumba.
Even with the police.	Ngakhale ndi apolisi.
It looks good.	Zikuwoneka zabwino.
He did not seek help.	Sanafune thandizo.
They can even live things.	Iwo akhoza ngakhale kukhala ndi moyo zinthu.
Each individual, his own life.	Munthu aliyense payekha, yekha ndi moyo wake.
So far it has been so.	Mpaka pano ndi choncho.
He was here this morning.	Iye anali pano mmawa uno.
I have two children.	Ndili ndi ana awiri.
He was not the only one.	Iye sanali mmodzi yekha.
You should.	Muyenera .

No one already knew.	Palibe amene anazindikira kale.
They are the way.	Iwo ndi njira.
I have nothing to fear.	Ndilibe chochita mantha.
But he realized.	Koma anazindikira.
This was not the case.	Izi sizinali choncho.
If so, we are many.	Ngati ndi choncho, ndife ambiri.
Very difficult because of things.	Zovuta kwambiri chifukwa cha zinthu.
You have good things like this.	Muli ndi zabwino ngati izi.
She was much younger than I was.	Anali wamng'ono kwambiri kuposa wanga.
What he did.	Zimene anachita .
Often it is hunger.	Nthawi zambiri ndi njala.
More as interesting.	Zambiri monga chidwi.
This is not your story.	Iyi si nkhani yanu.
This is not the answer.	Ili si yankho.
No, it is not.	Ayi, sichoncho.
As his own.	Monga ake ake.
And they all had a good time.	Ndipo onse anali ndi nthawi yabwino.

He was a little boy.	Iye anali mnyamata wamng'ono.
There is no one but you.	Palibe wina koma inu.

Everyone was terrified.	Aliyense anachita mantha.
You're at work.	Inu muli pa ntchito.
But no words came.	Koma palibe mawu amene anabwera.
I think it's something to do.	Ine ndikuganiza ndi chinachake choti tichite.
But the problem is emotional.	Koma vuto ndi maganizo.
He did not think he should.	Iye sankaganiza kuti ayenera.
Probably not at all.	Mwina palibe nkomwe.
Nothing but fear.	Palibe koma mantha.
I was always here.	Nthawi zonse ndinali kuno.

So it was difficult.	Choncho zinali zovuta.
But it was not enough.	Koma sizinali zokwanira.
This is money.	Ili ndi ndalama.
I have to have it.	Ndiyenera kukhala nazo.
Everyone is fine.	Aliyense amakhala bwino.

I never want to give up.	Sindikufuna konse kusiya.
Something for everyone.	Chinachake kwa aliyense.
He is not yours.	Iye si wanu.

People saw something.	Anthu anaona chinachake.
But almost everyone is.	Koma pafupifupi aliyense ali.
Because he could not.	Chifukwa sakanatha.
In the past, it was like a family.	Kale, zinali ngati banja.
And he would have to do so.	Ndipo akanayenera kutero.
You can do whatever you want.	Mutha kuchita chilichonse chomwe mukufuna.

Speaking of who.	Kunena za ndani .
You need to know the ideas.	Muyenera kudziwa malingaliro.

He is still winning.	Akadali kupambana.
We are alone here.	Tili tokha pano.
They are already on it.	Iwo ali kale pa izo.

But, apparently, he had no life.	Koma, zikuwoneka, analibe moyo.
He did nothing.	Iye sanachite kalikonse.
But that is not really true.	Koma izo si zoona kwenikweni.
Right now, there is none.	Pakali pano, palibe.
I can do something like this.	Ndikhoza kuchita monga chonchi.
Only you.	Inu nokha.

He was feeling a little bit last night.	Anali kumva pang'ono usiku watha.
Then there is the purchase.	Ndiye pali kugula.
It's a lot.	Ndi zambiri.
He is alone.	Ali yekha.

So no problem.	Choncho palibe vuto.
Do a.	Kodi a.

But he is with me.	Koma ali ndi ine.
No one talks to her.	Palibe amene amalankhula naye.
Many things.	Zinthu zambiri.
And well, that's about it.	Ndipo chabwino, ndizo za izo.
Well, good night.	Chabwino, usiku wabwino.
He realized when he stayed right away.	Anazindikira pamene anakhala nthawi yomweyo.
He has no time for me.	Alibe nthawi yanga.
He should be very afraid.	Ayenera kuchita mantha kwambiri.
He didn't know any of them.	Iye sankadziwa aliyense wa iwo.
More than ever.	Kuposa kale.
That was a lot for me.	Zimenezo zinali zambiri kwa ine.
But this is good news.	Koma iyi ndi nkhani yabwino.
He looked down.	Anayang'ana pansi.
There is definitely some music.	Pali nyimbo ndithu.
He was a little older than me.	Anali wamkulu pang'ono kwa ine.
Like, for a long time.	Monga, kwa nthawi yayitali.
She can be fine.	Iye akhoza kukhala bwino.
It was not good.	Izo sizinali bwino.
And if this was true.	Ndipo ngati izi zinali zoona .
If not, then soon.	Ngati sichoncho, ndiye posachedwa.
Many people.	Anthu ambiri.

No no.	Ayi ayi.
He said he had a house.	Anati ali ndi nyumba.
In all.	Mu zonse.
Some may stop working.	Ena akhoza kusiya kugwira ntchito.
He wants to do it alone.	Akufuna kuchita yekha.
He thinks people think he is good.	Akuganiza kuti anthu amaganiza kuti ndi wabwino.
And no children.	Ndipo palibe ana.
At home.	Kunyumba.
He had enough.	Iye anali nazo zokwanira.
It was he in two of them.	Anali iye mwa awiri a iwo.
It was a matter of some difficulty.	Zinali nkhani ya zovuta zina.
Nothing for you.	Palibe kanthu kwa inu.
I'm not sure.	Sindikudziwa bwino.
It was not like this.	Sizinali ngati izi.
But there is more here.	Koma pali zambiri pano.
He does a lot.	Iye amachita zambiri.
Finding the best way to do it right.	Kupeza njira yabwino yochitira bwino.
He was three years old.	Anali ndi zaka zitatu.
Not really me.	Kwenikweni si ine.
Good as dinner or lunch.	Zabwino ngati chakudya chamadzulo kapena chamasana.
I don't want to be anyone else.	Sindikufuna kukhala wina aliyense.
And, really, it was.	Ndipo, kwenikweni, izo zinali.
He knew it all now.	Iye ankadziwa zonse tsopano.
Then that's it.	Ndiye ndizo.
Someone did any of these.	Winawake anachita chilichonse mwa izi.
But he has nothing.	Koma alibe kanthu.
Sometimes from people.	Nthawi zina kuchokera kwa anthu.
You have to be alone.	Muyenera kukhala ndi inu nokha.
Many children, three to an adult.	Ana ambiri, atatu mpaka wamkulu.
Last night.	Usiku watha watha.
I know you are there.	Ndikudziwa kuti muli kumeneko.
I felt good to be around him.	Ndinamva bwino kukhala pafupi naye.
And at night.	Ndipo usiku.
That's not for me.	Izo si za ine.
But he is the only one who knows the answer.	Koma ndi iye yekha amene amadziwa yankho.
As before.	Monga kale.
As a result, we have to work with many things.	Chifukwa chake, tiyenera kugwira ntchito ndi zinthu zambiri.
That's all today.	Ndizo zonse lero.
Or he expected that.	Kapena iye ankayembekezera zimenezo.
I think that's good for me.	Ndikuganiza kuti ndi zabwino kwa ine.
I do not know.	Sindikudziwa .
You know, he didn't eat much.	Inu mukudziwa, iye sanali kudya kwambiri.
They have all done well.	Onse achita bwino.
Lots of great stuff that was really good.	Zinthu zambiri zabwino kwambiri zomwe zinali zabwino kwambiri.
I'm sure many other people do this.	Ndikutsimikiza kuti anthu ena ambiri amachita izi.
No one needs to be afraid.	Palibe amene ayenera kuchita mantha.
But tonight he didn't want anything to do with her.	Koma usikuuno sanafune chilichonse chochita naye.
I'm really into him.	Ndine kwenikweni kwa iye.
And they should.	Ndipo iwo ayenera kutero.
No one said anything.	Palibe amene ananena kalikonse.
I don't know why.	Sindimadziwa chifukwa chake.
No one is afraid now.	Palibe amene akuchita mantha tsopano.
Maybe not all, but some.	Mwina si onse, koma ena.
Little by little.	Pang'ono ndi nthawi.
But he can work with this.	Koma iye akhoza kugwira ntchito ndi izi.
We are all hungry.	Tonse tili ndi njala.
I knew the answer.	Ndinadziwa yankho.
What we have is money.	Zomwe tili nazo ndi ndalama.
None of them was me.	Palibe wa iwo amene ndinali ine.
But it is not too fast.	Koma si mofulumira kwambiri.
That looks like a victory.	Izo zikuwoneka ngati kupambana.
He cannot do this.	Sangathe kuchita izi.
She sat where she was.	Iye anakhala pamene iye anali.
They can be almost at home.	Iwo akhoza kukhala pafupifupi kunyumba.
It's not very good.	Si yabwino kwambiri.
That's why he came.	Ndi chifukwa chake anabwera.
If he is still alive.	Ngati akadali moyo.
It is for all, or not.	Ndi za onse, kapena palibe.
This was probably very good.	Izi mwina zinali zabwino kwambiri.

Then that.	Ndiye kuti .
And he started very well.	Ndipo iye anayamba kwambiri.

Very beautiful woman.	Mkazi wokongola kwambiri.

No one is around.	Palibe amene ali pafupi.
You need to find another way.	Muyenera kupeza njira ina.
There is no alcohol on this.	Palibe mowa pa izi.
No, no.	Ayi, ayi.

No one asked about me.	Palibe amene anafunsa za ine.
They thought it was too hard.	Iwo ankaganiza kuti zinali zovuta kwambiri.

But he knew that he needed to find a way.	Koma ankadziwa kuti ayenera kupeza njira.
But this is not the answer.	Koma ili si yankho.

He was a young man, most of them one.	Anali mnyamata, ambiri mwa mmodzi.

He can't do that.	Iye sangachite zimenezo.
Lots of people, really.	Anthu ambiri, kwenikweni.
There seems to be no problem.	Zikuwoneka kuti palibe vuto.
I could not tell him much.	Sindinathe kumuuza zambiri.

They knew a lot.	Iwo ankadziwa zambiri.
This was so.	Izi zinali choncho.
Me, soon.	Ine, posachedwa.

She is the wife of his word.	Iye ndi mkazi wa mawu ake.
You have everything.	Muli ndi zonse.
There is no need to do it.	Palibe chifukwa choti tichite.

Anyone can say whatever they want.	Aliyense akhoza kunena chilichonse chimene akufuna.
But he was alone.	Koma anali yekha.
Or maybe both at the same time.	Kapena mwina onse awiri nthawi imodzi.

But that would be nice.	Koma izi zingakhale zabwino.
Will he do it ?.	Adzachita?.
She became frightened.	Anayamba kuchita mantha.

And now is the time.	Ndipo tsopano ndi nthawi yabwino.
He wants that.	Iye akufuna zimenezo.
As he was a player.	Monga anali wosewera.

They wanted a family.	Iwo ankafuna banja.
They enjoyed each other's company very much.	Anasangalala kwambiri limodzi.

They said that.	Iwo ananena izo.
There is a problem.	Pali vuto.
There is no way.	Palibe njira.
I didn't know what to do with it.	Sindinadziwe choti ndichite nazo.

People need to know.	Anthu ayenera kudziwa.
He stayed out for a long time.	Anakhala kunja kwa nthawi yayitali.
Tomorrow will be you.	Mawa adzakhala iwe.
But that was not difficult.	Koma zimenezo sizinali zovuta.
I need your help.	Ndikufuna thandizo lanu.

Gradually two of them brought him closer.	Pang'ono ndi pang'ono awiri a iwo anabwera naye pafupi.

He was very good to me.	Anali wabwino kwambiri kwa ine.
You know, that's not my idea.	Inu mukudziwa, si lingaliro langa.
But these things are not always true.	Koma zinthu zimenezi si zoona nthawi zonse.

And for good reason with the kids.	Ndipo chifukwa chochita bwino ndi ana.
My son knows this.	Mwana wanga amadziwa izi.

That was, then.	Izo zinali, ndiye.
He must have known something.	Ayenera kuti ankadziwa chinachake.
He thought.	Iye anaganiza.
He became very afraid.	Anayamba kuchita mantha kwambiri.
Now about that.	Tsopano za izo.
He was really good.	Anali wabwino kwenikweni.
I like that.	Ndimakonda choncho.
You need to eat.	Muyenera kudya.
But he didn't.	Koma analibe.
Or a day.	Kapena tsiku.
This is not just me.	Izi si ine ndekha.
The days are better than ever.	Masiku ali kuposa kale lonse.
To do.	Kuti tichite.
They probably wouldn't.	Iwo mwina sakanatha.
This was not an opportunity for us.	Izi sizinali mwayi kwa ife.
Things were not that way.	Zinthu sizinali choncho.
That would be better than this.	Izo zingakhale bwino kuposa izi.
No, he thought.	Ayi, anaganiza.
They can tell they are fine.	Amatha kudziwa kuti ali bwino.
Or he can do anything.	Kapena akhoza kuchita chilichonse.
He started at home.	Anayamba kunyumba.
But that was not the case.	Koma sizinali choncho.
I wonder how long.	Ndikudabwa kuti mpaka liti.
Because of you.	Chifukwa cha inu.
I feel like a dog.	Ndikumva ngati galu.
But that was not enough for him.	Koma izi sizinali zokwanira kwa iye.

No one knew why.	Palibe amene ankadziwa chifukwa chake.

You have to be an expert.	Muyenera kukhala katswiri.

Definitely successful.	Kupambana ndithu.
He enjoyed it.	Iye anasangalala nazo.
All the best to her.	Zabwino zonse kwa iye.
Or a little sleep.	Kapena kugona pang'ono.
Because of this, he knew the time.	Chifukwa cha zimenezi, ankadziwa nthawi.

Sometimes better.	Nthawi zina bwino.
And that's about it.	Ndipo ndizo za izo.
It's his wife.	Ndi mkazi wake.
He came, well, as a friend.	Anabwera, chabwino, ngati bwenzi.
All the best.	Zabwino zonse.
But he must do well.	Koma ayenera kuchita bwino.
Someone was already here.	Winawake anali pano kale.
I wanted to work with him.	Ndinkafuna kugwira naye ntchito.
She knew about him.	Iye ankadziwa za iye.
Maybe even more.	Mwina ngakhale zambiri.
But it is my life.	Koma ndi moyo wanga.
But he loves to play.	Koma amakonda kusewera.
They often stay home with nothing to do.	Nthawi zambiri amakhala kunyumba popanda chochita.
You are your wife, you are your husband.	Inu ndinu mkazi wanu, ndinu mwamuna wanu.
It's another good job for the police.	Ndi ntchito ina yabwino apolisi.
And he was hungry.	Ndipo anali ndi njala.
That would be great.	Zingakhale zabwino.
But someone has to talk.	Koma wina ayenera kulankhula.
You already know about them.	Inu mukudziwa kale za iwo.

He must have known better, he knew that.	Ayenera kuti ankadziwa bwino kwambiri, ankadziwa zimenezo.
He wasn't sure what exactly.	Iye sanali wotsimikiza chimene kwenikweni.
You can do this yourself.	Mutha kuchita izi nokha.
I do not want to hear that story.	Sindikufuna kumva nkhani imeneyo.
She is so beautiful.	Iye ndi wokongola kwambiri.
I do not know what he wants.	Sindikudziwa chomwe akufuna.

No one knows more, or he does better than he does.	Palibe amene akudziwa zambiri, kapena amachita zabwino kuposa iye.
It is better to live without him.	Ndi bwino kukhala popanda iye.

Right now, he didn't have time.	Pakali pano, analibe nthawi.
One in prison.	Mmodzi mndende.
He was doing.	Iye anali kuchita.
You already have it all.	Muli zonse kale.
You know why.	Inu mukudziwa chifukwa chake.
All was not well.	Zonse sizinali bwino.
She is so beautiful.	Ndi wokongola kwambiri.
He was close.	Iye anali pafupi.
Someone can eat.	Wina akhoza kudya.
Well, he was there.	Chabwino, iye anali kumeneko.
He knows what he likes and what he likes.	Amadziwa zomwe amakonda ndi zomwe amakonda.
He became lonely to himself.	Iye anakhala yekha kwa iye yekha.
All you have to do is believe.	Zomwe muyenera kuchita ndikukhulupirira.
Now I know better.	Tsopano ndikudziwa bwino.

Why did he do that?	N’chifukwa chiyani anachita zimenezo?
Maybe next week.	Mwina sabata yamawa.
Many did not know what they were.	Ambiri sankadziwa chomwe iwo anali.
Well, a little about that.	Chabwino, pang'ono za izo.

Not so lucky.	Ayi choncho mwayi.
He's a good man, you know.	Iye ndi munthu wabwino, inu mukudziwa.

And he wasn't even interested in knowing about it.	Ndipo analibe chidwi nkomwe kudziwa za izo.
That time is up.	Nthawi imeneyo yatha.
But he was ready.	Koma anali wokonzeka.
Now most people know.	Tsopano anthu ambiri akudziwa.
I have to learn everything myself.	Ndiyenera kuphunzira zonse ndekha.

Therefore, it is in.	Choncho, ili mu.
He wanted.	Iye ankafuna .

You're a friend.	Ndinu bwenzi.
Often my life is big.	Nthawi zambiri moyo wanga wamkulu.
Sometimes he wasn't.	Nthawi zina iye sanali.

For the rest of my life.	Kwa moyo wanga wonse.
But this was not always the case.	Koma sizinali choncho nthawi zonse.
You want to help.	Mukufuna kuthandiza.
Someone is very close to his person.	Munthu wina ali pafupi kwambiri ndi munthu wake.
Tom can do that.	Tom akhoza kutero.
I can't find enough stuff.	Sindingathe kupeza zinthu zokwanira.
They did well.	Iwo anachita bwino.
He has known the family for years.	Iye akudziwa banja kwa zaka.
I think the answer is no.	Ndikuganiza kuti yankho ndi ayi.
Out of it all.	Kunja kwa izo zonse.

Well, you got it.	Chabwino, inu muli nazo izo.
There is no reason for any of them to know.	Palibe chifukwa aliyense wa iwo akanayenera kudziwa.
But he does not have to be great.	Koma sayenera kukhala wamkulu.
All right! 	Chabwino!
Maybe a doctor.	Mwina dokotala.
Everyone has one.	Aliyense ali ndi mmodzi.
You have to quit.	Muyenera kusiya.
They are a purchase.	Iwo ndi kugula.
She is very.	Iye ali kwambiri.

You do not have to do this.	Simuyenera kuchita izi.

Apparently he was lucky.	Zikuoneka kuti anali ndi mwayi.
Or his interest.	Kapena chidwi chake.

They went very fast.	Iwo anapita mofulumira kwambiri.
It has a lot of ideas.	Ili ndi malingaliro ambiri.
They have nothing to do with him.	Iwo alibe kanthu kwa iye.
They did not do well.	Iwo sanachite bwino.

They all looked at him.	Onse anayang’ana pa iye.
Or this time.	Kapena nthawi ino.
It was a lot.	Zinali zambiri.
That would be extremely difficult.	Zimenezo zingakhale zovuta kwambiri.
And this is what each of you should do.	Ndipo izi ndi zimene aliyense wa inu ayenera kuchita.
He is not alone.	Sali yekha .
I have a car.	Ndili ndi galimoto.

We are very worried.	Tili ndi nkhawa kwambiri.
He says he doesn't know, so he doesn't know.	Akuti sakudziwa, ndiye sakudziwa.
They wanted somebody pretty.	Iwo ankafuna winawake wokongola.
He tried the door.	Anayesa chitseko.
He came without.	Anabwera alibe.
One came to me.	Mmodzi anabwera kwa ine.
Or who he was.	Kapena yemwe iye anali.
I like good food.	Ndimakonda chakudya chabwino.

On the other hand, sometimes.	Pa nayenso, nthawi zina.
He had one as a child.	Anali ndi mmodzi ali mwana.
There is not enough of it.	Palibe zokwanira za izo.

He didn't know.	Iye sankadziwa.
But they had no money.	Koma analibe ndalama.
It is not a person, or people.	Si munthu, kapena anthu.

You need to know about it.	Muyenera kudziwa za izo.
Everyone knows why.	Aliyense amadziwa chifukwa chake.

We have an idea.	Tili ndi lingaliro.
Go to bed early.	Kugona msanga.
And maybe that's it.	Ndipo mwina ndi zimenezo.
From a woman.	Kuchokera kwa mkazi.
They seemed very close to the food.	Ankawoneka pafupi kwambiri ndi chakudya.
He was too big.	Iye anali wamkulu kwambiri.
You're my life, now.	Ndinu moyo wanga, tsopano.
Do not be intimidated.	Asachite mantha.
No one came.	Palibe amene anabwera.

Very good beer.	Mowa wabwino kwambiri.
But here's something you need to know.	Koma ndi chinachake chimene muyenera kudziwa.

A little more both.	Ena pang'ono onse awiri.
He was a good, good man.	Anali munthu wabwino, wabwino.

Or a teacher.	Kapena mphunzitsi.
When he did not know his name.	Pamene iye sankadziwa dzina lake.
But it should not be.	Koma sayenera kukhala.
I can't solve the problem.	Sindingathe vuto.
He said he thought it would be good for me.	Anati akuganiza kuti zingakhale zabwino kwa ine.
Or it could be.	Kapena zingakhale .
But you already have it.	Koma muli nazo kale.
I am your father.	Ndine bambo anu.

I'm fine with that, if you are.	Ndili bwino ndi zimenezo, ngati muli.
Interest is money.	Chidwi ndi ndalama.
It's a nice house.	Ndi nyumba yabwino.
That's the reason he was here.	Ndicho chifukwa iye anali kuno.

Her parents live nearby.	Makolo ake amakhala pafupi.
That he was not ready.	Kuti sanali wokonzeka.
I heard his voice.	Ndinamva mawu ake.

This is a story.	Iyi ndi nkhani.
And if things did not go well.	Ndipo ngati zinthu sizinali bwino.

But no one noticed.	Koma palibe amene anazindikira.
Myself, myself.	Ine ndekha, ndekha.

He could not leave.	Sanathe kuchoka.
And so it was.	Ndipo zinali choncho.
No one knew where we were going.	Palibe amene ankadziwa kumene tiyenera kupita.

Well he was happy.	Chabwino iye anasangalala.
And that was it.	Ndipo zimenezo zinali .
I did not want to know more.	Sindinafune kudziwa zambiri.

They already have it.	Iwo ali nazo kale.
But it was not enough.	Koma sizinali zokwanira.
I have a date.	Ndili ndi tsiku .

She looked at him.	Iye anayang'ana pa iye.
No one was visible.	Palibe amene ankawoneka.
But perhaps he wanted to say more.	Koma mwina ankafuna kunena zina.

And it was quite good.	Ndipo zinali bwino ndithu.

He was not a child.	Sanali mwana.

They are not feeling well.	Sakhala bwino bwino.
He sat for a long time with nothing to do.	Anakhala kwa nthawi yayitali popanda chochita.
How beautiful she was.	Iye anali wokongola bwanji.
There are more people than jobs.	Pali anthu ambiri kuposa ntchito.
Not every doctor is ready to do that.	Si dokotala aliyense amene ali wokonzeka kutero.

No one knows why.	Palibe amene akudziwa chifukwa chake.

She was his wife now.	Iye anali mkazi wake tsopano.
And this he did very well.	Ndipo izi anachita bwino kwambiri.

We just have to talk to him.	Tiyenera kulankhula naye basi.
People were people.	Anthu anali anthu.

But that was not good enough.	Koma zimenezo sizinali zabwino mokwanira.
I like stories.	Ndimakonda nkhani.
I did not know any of these.	Sindinadziwe zina mwa izi.
For me, there are a lot of challenges with it.	Kwa ine, pali zovuta zambiri nazo.

I think now is a good time.	Ndikuganiza kuti tsopano ndi nthawi yabwino.
If so, it was good that now.	Ngati ndi choncho, zinali bwino kuti tsopano.

That is why he knows everything.	Ndi chifukwa chake amadziwa zonse.

That is, word for word.	Izi ndizo, mawu ndi mawu.
He had enough.	Iye anali nazo zokwanira.
And no one knows that.	Ndipo palibe amene akudziwa izo.
I wanted to say something.	Ndinkafuna kunena chinachake.
There is another real reason.	Pali chifukwa china kwenikweni.
But that was not the case.	Koma sizinali choncho.

Then he could end up with this.	Ndiye akanatha ndi izi.
She is not at home and has no life.	Sali kunyumba ndipo alibe moyo.
He didn't do that.	Iye sanachite zimenezo.
I did not know why he was there.	Sindinadziwe chifukwa chake anali kumeneko.

Everyone here was like family to me.	Aliyense pano anali ngati banja kwa ine.
He had no money, nothing.	Iye analibe ndalama, analibe kalikonse.
You need to stop being scared.	Muyenera kusiya kuchita mantha.

Many days began now.	Masiku ambiri anayamba choncho tsopano.
Or many think.	Kapena ambiri amaganiza.
But food, there are concerns.	Koma chakudya, pali nkhawa.
He loves music very much.	Amakonda nyimbo kwambiri.
He probably did not want a car.	Mwina sankafuna galimoto.
Probably for a boyfriend.	Mwina kwa chibwenzi.
But now there is another reason.	Koma tsopano pali chifukwa china.
They are nothing.	Iwo sali kanthu .

I think he knows that.	Ine ndikuganiza iye akudziwa zimenezo.
Honestly, he seems incapable of helping.	Kunena zoona, akuwoneka kuti sangathe kuthandiza.
Everyone has nothing to do.	Munthu aliyense alibe chochita.
They all were.	Onse anali.
If you are lucky, you are good.	Ngati muli ndi mwayi, ndiwe wabwino.
Her eyes are scared.	Maso ake ali ndi mantha.

This was not always the case.	Izi sizinali choncho nthawi zonse.
He came here last night.	Iye anabwera kuno usiku watha.
He does not want to do that.	Iye sakufuna kuchita zimenezo.
It was very difficult to find things.	Zinali zovuta kwambiri kupeza zinthu.
No one did.	Palibe amene anachita zimenezi.
Because he did.	Chifukwa anachita zimenezi.
But even that was not enough.	Koma ngakhale zimenezo sizinali zokwanira.
Now he had no heart.	Tsopano iye analibe mtima.
He was interested now.	Anali ndi chidwi tsopano.
What he didn't have.	Chimene iye analibe.

You can't play with your life like this.	Simungathe kusewera ndi moyo wanu chonchi.

He was not a great scholar.	Iye sanali wophunzira wamkulu.
But it was very difficult.	Koma zinali zovuta kwambiri.

He did not want to be with her.	Sanafune kukhala naye.
Too old to be a child.	Wamkulu kwambiri kukhala mwana.
The music is good.	Nyimbo ndi zabwino.
He didn't have a chance like them.	Iye analibe mwayi ngati iwo.

So who do you want as a teacher 'and so on.	Ndiye mukufuna ndani monga mphunzitsi' ndipo ndi choncho.

We are a family.	Ndife banja.
No one said anything.	Palibe amene ananena kanthu.
But this is not true.	Koma zimenezi si zoona.

But it was for a woman.	Koma izo zinali za mkazi.
It was so good.	Zinali zabwino kwambiri.
But there are no police.	Koma palibe apolisi.

My only child from time to time.	Mwana wanga yekha nthawi ndi nthawi.
He knew it all.	Iye ankadziwa izo zonse.
It seems to belong to his life.	Zikuoneka kuti ndi za moyo wake.
No reason, really.	Palibe chifukwa chake, kwenikweni.
It's one way.	Ndi njira imodzi.
That's exactly it.	Ndi zimenezo kwenikweni.
He was one of the lucky ones.	Iye anali mmodzi mwa anthu amene anali ndi mwayi.
He seemed interested in it.	Iye ankawoneka kuti anachita chidwi nazo.
He held that position for a long time.	Anakhala ndi ntchito imeneyo kwa nthawi yaitali.
Not all money.	Si ndalama zonse.
I told her no.	Ndinamuuza kuti ayi.
Sometimes they do hard things.	Nthawi zina amachita zovuta.
I have to do what he wants.	Ndiyenera kuchita zomwe akufuna.
Very good.	Zabwino kwambiri.
But that is not true.	Koma zimenezo si zoona.
His people did not want to do that.	Anthu ake sanafune kuchita zimenezi.

Sometimes there is none.	Nthawi zina palibe.
He says it all really well.	Akunena zonse kwenikweni.
He said no, he did not want to eat.	Anati ayi, sanafune kudya.

Most people know this.	Anthu ambiri amadziwa izi.
But it is over.	Koma watha.

This is the story of one of them.	Iyi ndi nkhani ya mmodzi wa iwo.
Now more than ever, he was alone.	Tsopano kuposa ndi kale lonse, iye anali yekha.
No one knows where they are going.	Palibe amene akudziwa kumene akupita.

He didn't really know what to do.	Iye sankadziwa kwenikweni choti achite.
At home and at school, she did well.	Kunyumba ndi kusukulu anachita bwino kwambiri.
But for then it was enough.	Koma kwa nthawi imeneyo zinali zokwanira.

He should be here today.	Ayenera kukhala pano lero.
But he always knew what he wanted.	Koma nthawi zonse ankadziwa zomwe ankafuna.
He says it is not true.	Akunena kuti si zoona.
Everything else was fine.	Zina zonse zinali zabwino.
Or tell a story.	Kapena kunena nkhani.
For all time, really.	Kwa nthawi zonse, kwenikweni.

That's why they do it.	Ndi chifukwa chake amachita izo.
He expected none.	Iye ankayembekezera kuti palibe.
He did not seek her help.	Sanafune thandizo lake.
Her husband was a good man, she knew.	Mwamuna wake anali munthu wabwino, iye ankadziwa.
But, you have to be.	Koma, muyenera kukhala.

She is good enough.	Iye ndi wabwino mokwanira.
Mine is my specialist.	Wanga ndi katswiri wanga.
None of them said a word about it.	Palibe m’modzi wa iwo amene ananena mawu pa izo.
Nobody knew what they were doing.	Palibe amene ankadziwa chimene iwo anali kuchita.
I know about these things.	Ndikudziwa za zinthu izi.
No reason.	Palibe chifukwa.
It was so close.	Izo zinali pafupi kwambiri.
None of the women were very good players.	Palibe mkazi aliyense amene anali wosewera bwino kwambiri.
But no one else.	Koma palibe wina.
We have all been scared.	Tonse takhala ndi mantha.
He knows his voice.	Iye amadziwa mawu ake.
Some of them are very good.	Zina mwa izo ndi zabwino kwambiri.
He was learning a lot.	Anali kuphunzira zambiri.
His words are worrying.	Mawu ake ali ndi nkhawa.
And often, very difficult.	Ndipo nthawi zambiri, zovuta kwambiri.
She has three children.	Ali ndi ana atatu.
All night long.	Usiku wonse.
I think everyone did a good job.	Ndikuganiza kuti aliyense anachita ntchito yabwino.
And that's all he wanted.	Ndipo ndizo zonse zomwe ankafuna.
There is nothing to be afraid of.	Palibe choti muchite mantha.

He looked around.	Iye anayang'ana pafupi.
He wasn't coming.	Iye sanali kubwera.
Everyone knows what's going on here.	Aliyense akudziwa zomwe zikuchitika pano.
But he can do both.	Koma akhoza kuchita zonse.
You can come anytime you want.	Mutha kubwera nthawi yomwe mukufuna.

He wanted to know about people.	Iye ankafuna kudziwa za anthu.
He too had no problem.	Nayenso analibe vuto.
But now he was alone.	Koma tsopano anali yekha.
They talk about him all the time.	Amalankhula za iye nthawi zonse.
So it doesn't really work.	Choncho si kwenikweni ntchito.
They do not know how to do this.	Sakudziwa momwe angachitire izi.
But worry about you.	Koma nkhawa za inu.
Now she was fine.	Tsopano anali bwino.
Everyone knew his name.	Aliyense ankadziwa dzina lake.

As she was a girl.	Monga iye anali mtsikana.
But it really should be.	Koma kwenikweni ayenera kukhala.
And if there is a child.	Ndipo ngati pali mwana.
But, but.	Koma, koma.

During the day and work, no play.	Masana ndi ntchito, palibe kusewera.

But that is what he does.	Koma ndi zomwe amachita.
Every morning.	Nthawi zonse m'mawa.
It's your children.	Ndi ana anu.

She wanted more from him.	Ankafuna zambiri kwa iye.

I do not have my phone.	Ndilibe foni yanga.
But he is on something.	Koma ali pa chinachake.

Then he was claiming the case.	Ndiye anali kunena kuti mlandu.
There is no work.	Palibe ntchito.

Lower than anyone else.	Pansi kuposa aliyense.
They talk stories, because that's what they do best.	Amalankhula nkhani, chifukwa ndi zomwe amachita bwino.
Words become words and words become words.	Mawu amakhala mawu ndipo mawu amakhala mawu.
Well, he has to.	Chabwino, iye ayenera kutero.

Many others.	Ena ambiri.
Or a woman.	Kapena mkazi.
She was happy to leave.	Anasangalala kuchoka.

He came alone to this day.	Anabwera yekha mpaka pano.
I will stay here for a long time.	Ndikhala pano kwa nthawi yayitali.
I didn't want to have anything to do with this.	Sindinafune kukhala ndi chilichonse chochita ndi izi.
My son loves to work with him.	Mwana wanga amakonda kugwira naye ntchito.
He is determined.	Iye ndi wotsimikiza mtima.
It was hard.	Zinali zovuta.
No problem.	Palibe vuto.
And if not, they should get one.	Ndipo ngati palibe, iwo ayenera kupeza imodzi.
Well, then.	Zabwino, ndiye.

There seems to be a problem.	Zikuwoneka kuti pali vuto.
And here you are.	Ndipo inu muli pano.

You can go.	Mutha kupita.
He looked good now.	Iye ankawoneka bwino tsopano.
I think everyone does.	Ndikuganiza kuti aliyense amachita.
That's why he started driving.	N’chifukwa chake anayamba kuyendetsa galimoto.
No one noticed anything.	Palibe amene anazindikira kalikonse.
But this is not true.	Koma zimenezi si zoona.
I can't do it now.	Sindingathe kuchita tsopano.
There are no other options right now.	Palibe njira zina pakali pano.
She went to my school.	Anapita kusukulu yanga.
You cannot live here alone.	Simungathe kukhala pano nokha.
Probably always.	Mwina nthawi zonse.

There is nothing wrong with saying no.	Palibe vuto kunena kuti ayi.
Because they are.	Chifukwa iwo ali.
It was good.	Zinali zabwino.
Well, then no.	Chabwino, ndiye ayi.
Only one of us.	Mmodzi yekha wa ife.
I do not know.	Sindikudziwa.
And one can be with another person.	Ndipo wina akhoza kukhala ndi munthu wina.
But not interesting.	Koma chidwi ayi.
He was in the family way.	Iye anali mu njira ya banja.
Each has three children.	Aliyense ali ndi ana atatu.
Like, a lot of it.	Monga, zambiri za izo.
But that is why.	Koma ndicho chifukwa chake.
This is the best.	Iyi ndiye yabwino kwambiri.
Without a house, you know, there is no other way.	Popanda nyumba, mukudziwa, palibe njira ina.
She wanted a baby.	Iye ankafuna kukhala ndi mwana.
He knew what he did.	Iye ankadziwa zomwe anachita.
I know what he is talking about.	Ndikudziwa zomwe akunena.
All he wants is to be alone.	Chomwe akufuna ndi kukhala yekha.
It was good to sit down.	Zinali bwino kukhala pansi.

The day is today.	Tsiku ndi lero.
And alone.	Ndipo yekha.

Until nothing.	Mpaka palibe kanthu.

He had a good time with her.	Iye anali ndi nthawi yabwino ndi iye.
He is like this at work.	Ali chonchi kuntchito.
Even in the works it looks good.	Ngakhale mu ntchito zikuwoneka bwino.
My wife is one of them.	Mkazi wanga ndi mmodzi wa iwo.
That doesn't matter.	Zimenezo si kanthu.
He has nothing to do with money.	Iye alibe chochita ndi ndalama.
I feel sorry for him.	Ndikumva chisoni chifukwa cha iye.
This was not always the case.	Izi sizinali choncho nthawi zonse.
It's a word.	Ndi mawu.
He did not want to do that.	Sanafune kuti achite zimenezo.
But he was worried.	Koma anali ndi nkhawa.
And he knew that.	Ndipo iye ankadziwa izo.
He is just a friend of everyone else.	Iye ndi bwenzi la aliyense basi.
Here are three things you should do.	Ndizo zinthu zitatu zomwe muyenera kuchita.
And every one of them.	Ndipo aliyense wa iwo.
It could be a lot.	Zingakhale zambiri.
I always wanted to quit.	Nthawi zonse ndinkafuna kusiya.

But for me he will always be my son.	Koma kwa ine adzakhala mwana wanga nthawi zonse.
This was very difficult.	Izi zinali zovuta kwambiri.
He is never alone in that.	Iye sali konse yekha mu zimenezo.
Difficult for both of us.	Zovuta tonse awiri.
Well, he thought.	Chabwino ndithu, iye anaganiza.
Her parents did not have much money.	Makolo ake analibe ndalama zambiri.
I'm happy about it.	Ndine wokondwa nazo.
We did not want this.	Sanafune izi.
But there is no time now.	Koma palibe nthawi tsopano.

He is not what they thought he was.	Iye si chimene iwo ankaganiza kuti iye anali.
All about food.	Zonse za chakudya.
Problems this time.	Zovuta nthawi ino.
They have done a very good job.	Iwo achita ntchito yabwino kwambiri.
He was older than she is.	Anali wamkulu kuposa iye.
Everyone has been with him.	Aliyense wakhala naye.
But he was here.	Koma iye anali pano.

She knows she is beautiful.	Iye amadziwa kuti ndi wokongola.
But the police did not want to.	Koma apolisi sanafune.

And maybe some people.	Ndipo mwina anthu ena.
They do it all the time.	Iwo amachita izo nthawi zonse.

And that was not true.	Ndipo zimenezo sizinali zoona.
In most cases, this is a long way off.	Nthawi zambiri, iyi ndi njira yayitali.
So you can't buy it.	Choncho simungathe kugula.
Success is not a problem.	Kupambana si vuto.

He was ready to go.	Iye anali wokonzeka kupita.

When he did this, when he did that.	Pamene iye anachita izi, pamene iye anachita izo.
Why? 	Chifukwa chiyani?

We need to have more.	Tiyenera kukhala ndi zambiri.

And it may not be true.	Ndipo mwina si zoona.
None of us thought what he wanted.	Palibe aliyense wa ife amene ankaganiza zomwe angafune.
That's what they like about him.	Ndicho chimene iwo amakonda za iye.
This is why they are here.	Izi ndi chifukwa cha iwo kukhala pano.

Someone did not want money.	Winawake sanafune ndalama.
Sometimes it is not.	Nthawi zina sichoncho.

Sometimes, too fast.	Nthawi zina, mofulumira kwambiri.

A busy, busy boy.	Mnyamata wotanganidwa, wotanganidwa.
They came to me.	Iwo anabwera kwa ine.
Thoughts become things.	Malingaliro amakhala zinthu.
This was not always the case.	Sizinali choncho nthawi zonse.
He was not intimidated by fear.	Iye sanachite mantha ndi mantha.
I did not want that.	Sindinafune zimenezo.
But there is more.	Koma pali zambiri.
He does not have to do everything himself.	Iye sayenera kuchita zonse yekha.

Today, it's your turn.	Lero, ndi nthawi yanu.
It wasn't hard.	Sizinali zovuta.
All right now this.	Chabwino tsopano izi.
But there are no such things.	Koma palibe zinthu ngati zimenezi.

Then talk to you.	Ndiye kulankhula nanu.
He wasn't even.	Iye sanali ngakhale.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Mwina imeneyo ndi njira yake.
I did not want to leave.	Sindinafune kuchoka.
And that is the story.	Ndipo nkhani yake ndi imeneyo.
That was it, he thought.	Izi zinali choncho, iye anaganiza.
Now he is in prison.	Tsopano ali m'ndende.
He had no time.	Analibe nthawi.
Probably because she is a woman.	Mwina chifukwa iye ndi mkazi.
She was beautiful.	Iye anali wokongola.

Male or female, young or old.	Mwamuna kapena mkazi, wamkulu kapena wamng’ono.

Now, to me, that's a story.	Tsopano, kwa ine, ndi nkhani.
And he did not.	Ndipo sanathe.
They did not seem interested.	Iwo ankaoneka kuti alibe chidwi.
But you are a player.	Koma ndinu wosewera.
You should sleep here.	Muyenera kugona pano.
Or not.	Kapena ayi.
No one wanted to talk to him.	Palibe amene ankafuna kulankhula naye.
But there is no reason for it.	Koma palibe chifukwa chake.
He went to the first.	Iye anapita kwa woyamba.
It's a good job.	Ndi ntchito yabwino.
That is why this is what we need to know.	Chifukwa chake izi ndi zomwe tiyenera kudziwa.
You have children.	Muli ndi ana.
If not.	Ngati sichoncho .
But often that was not the case.	Koma nthawi zambiri izi sizinali choncho.
He doesn't have to be here.	Sayenera kukhala pano.
Age is not good for most people.	Zaka si zabwino kwa anthu ambiri.
Very good man, down here.	Munthu wabwino kwambiri, pansi pano.
I do not know why he said this.	Sindikudziwa chifukwa chake ananena izi.
But almost all did.	Koma pafupifupi onse anachita zimenezi.
And no, not at all.	Ndipo ayi ayi.

This is what he wanted.	Izi ndi zomwe ankafuna.
And he always had an idea.	Ndipo nthawi zonse anali ndi lingaliro.
There is nothing that man can do.	Palibe chimene munthu angachite.
Always the same way.	Nthawi zonse njira yomweyo.
Sometimes there is nothing that a person can do.	Nthawi zina palibe chimene munthu angachite.
He was a very good boy.	Anali mwana wabwino kwambiri.
No one out here thinks much of it.	Kunja kuno palibe amene amaganiza zambiri za izo.
That's about it.	Ndizo za izo.
Or he may have thought about his homework.	Kapena anaganiza za homuweki yake.
Well, a lot, really.	Chabwino, zambiri, kwenikweni.
They think.	Iwo amaganiza .
And you know he wants more.	Ndipo mukudziwa kuti akufuna zambiri.

In many cases, food is good for us.	Nthawi zambiri, chakudya ndi chabwino kwa ife.
He must have been waiting.	Ayenera kuti ankayembekezera.
But he was not a good man.	Koma sanali munthu wabwino.
And another.	Ndipo wina.
They talk a lot about it.	Amalankhula zambiri za izo.
We have others.	Tili ndi ena.
Everyone was so nice.	Aliyense anali wabwino kwambiri.
I'm doing this now.	Ndikuchita izi tsopano.
Or already.	Kapena kale.
Or maybe they don’t think so.	Kapena mwina sakuganiza.
He should stop.	Ayenera kusiya.
Someone enjoyed your talk.	Wina anasangalala ndi nkhani yanu.
About your life.	Za moyo wanu.
Or all three.	Kapena onse atatu.
And he has to be.	Ndipo iye ayenera kukhala.

Everything was fine.	Zonse zinali bwino.
Although it was not.	Ngakhale kuti sanali.
I did not want to leave.	Sindinafune kuchoka.

Nobody knew that.	Palibe amene ankadziwa izo.
He had enough.	Iye anali nazo zokwanira.
I was alone there.	Ndinali ndekha kumeneko.
He wanted to say more.	Ankafuna kunena zambiri.
You need to find a very good professional.	Muyenera kupeza katswiri wabwino kwambiri.
As if it were not his.	Monga ngati sanali ake.
Maybe good, maybe real.	Mwina zabwino, mwina zoona.

Or if someone has a lot of money.	Kapena ngati wina ali ndi ndalama zambiri.
He was not sure if there was anyone else.	Iye sanali wotsimikiza ngati pali wina aliyense.
But he was not here.	Koma iye sanali pano.

He thought of many things.	Iye ankaganiza zinthu zambiri.
But this was not always the case.	Koma sizinali choncho nthawi zonse.
Some words are personal.	Mawu ena ndi munthu payekha.

I'm happy to play with him.	Ndine wokondwa kusewera naye.
But this was not because of him.	Koma izi sizinali chifukwa cha iye.

Money is not my business.	Ndalama si nkhani yanga.
There are many ways this can be done.	Pali njira zambiri zomwe munthu angachitire izi.
It's too scary to say anything.	Ndi mantha kwambiri kunena kalikonse.

They thought a lot.	Iwo ankaganiza kwambiri.
We cannot do without you.	Sitingathe kuchita popanda inu.
He has something.	Ali ndi kanthu.
It wasn't for me.	Izo sizinali za ine.
But he loves to do so.	Koma amakonda kutero.
It all happens together.	Zonse zikuchitika limodzi.

He is the only one.	Iye ndi mmodzi yekha.
Like my father.	Monga bambo wanga.

My son was older.	Mwana wanga anali wamkulu.
As always, all ideas are mine !.	Monga nthawi zonse, malingaliro onse ndi anga!.

I want to learn all about you.	Ndikufuna kuphunzira zonse za inu.
But he wasn't sure, he wasn't sure.	Koma iye sanali wotsimikiza, iye sanali wotsimikiza.

He knows how to play.	Amadziwa kusewera.
This was not always the case, but often it was.	Izi sizinali choncho nthawi zonse, koma nthawi zambiri zinali choncho.
There is no one around.	Palibe aliyense pafupi.
He is hungry now.	Ali ndi njala tsopano.
He knew why.	Iye ankadziwa chifukwa chake.

But she was not able to tell him the truth about her problem.	Koma sanathe kumuuza zoona za vuto lake.
Probably no one knows why.	Mwina palibe amene akudziwa chifukwa chake.
I do not know what it is.	Sindikudziwa kuti ndi chiyani.
You cannot be anything to everyone.	Simungathe kukhala chilichonse kwa aliyense.
He is one of you.	Iye ndi mmodzi wa inu.
It seems to be dead.	Zikuoneka kuti ndife.
Your life is yours.	Moyo wanu ndi wanu.

And he always knows where he is.	Ndipo nthawi zonse amadziwa komwe ali.
But it is probably not the best option.	Koma mwina si njira yabwino.

Everyone has something.	Aliyense ali ndi chinachake.
I really hope we are.	Ndikuyembekeza kwambiri kuti tili.

He thought everyone did.	Iye ankaganiza kuti aliyense anachita.
But she was so beautiful to me.	Koma iye anali wokongola kwambiri kwa ine.
Or, though.	Kapena, ngakhale.
Until that happened, he was lucky.	Mpaka pamene izo zinachitika, iye anali ndi mwayi.
He could not leave.	Sanathe kuchoka.
He had enough.	Iye anali nazo zokwanira.
I know that is not the case.	Ndikudziwa kuti sichoncho.
Without giving up.	Popanda kusiya.
They were all in it.	Iwo onse anali mu izo.
But with all your life.	Koma ndi moyo wanu wonse.

You need to find your life.	Muyenera kupeza moyo wanu.
He was lucky and he knew it.	Anali ndi mwayi ndipo ankadziwa.
Enough of them.	Zokwanira za iwo.
It's your home.	Ndi nyumba yanu.
You have a new job to do.	Muli ndi ntchito yatsopano yoti muchite.

You are not your own home.	Inu si nyumba yanu.
And she is very ready.	Ndipo iye ali wokonzeka kwambiri.

Well maybe he was.	Chabwino mwina iye anali.

They are a family now and all.	Iwo ndi banja tsopano ndi onse.

And there is more.	Ndipo pali zina zambiri.
And it is his family.	Ndipo ndi banja lake.
Another issue is his attitude.	Nkhani ina ndi maganizo ake.
I think they will be.	Ine ndikuganiza iwo adzakhala.
Long-term study.	Kuphunzira kwa nthawi yayitali.
I think he can be very good.	Ndikuganiza kuti akhoza kukhala wabwino kwambiri.

Basically, he is good.	Kwenikweni, iye ndi wabwino.

But it was not enough.	Koma sizinali zokwanira.
It's a lot.	Ndi zambiri.

Probably a good reason.	Mwina ndi chifukwa chabwino.
He was right out there.	Iye anali kunja kumene.
Your life is very busy.	Moyo wanu ndi wotanganidwa kwambiri.
My father had a car.	Bambo anga anali ndi galimoto.

He had things.	Iye anali nazo zinthu.

He should have had it.	Iye akanayenera kukhala ndi izo.
That's all he had.	Ndizo zonse zomwe iye anali nazo.
Everyone knew at that time that there was a problem.	Aliyense ankadziwa nthawi imeneyo kuti pali vuto.
What some people knew.	Zomwe anthu ena ankadziwa.
But to be honest, this is not true.	Koma kunena zoona, izi si zoona.
They didn't have time for that.	Iwo analibe nthawi ya izo.
It will be a day.	Iwo adzakhala tsiku.
But some people do not care.	Koma anthu ena alibe nazo ntchito.
I was there without it.	Ndinali kumeneko ndilibe.
I don't like people.	Sindimakonda anthu.
That's my way.	Ndi njira yanga.
Good to have you here.	Zabwino kukhala nanu pano.
She is a little girl.	Iye ndi mtsikana wamng'ono.
There are words on everything, you know.	Pali mawu pa chilichonse, mukudziwa.
Not a lot of money.	Si ndalama zambiri.
You do not have to tell the truth.	Simuyenera kulankhula zoona.
He did what he could.	Anachita zonse zomwe akanatha.
In fact, he did the same.	Kwenikweni, nayenso anachita zimenezo.
You know, good for him.	Inu mukudziwa, zabwino kwa iye.
Everyone is a friend and everyone else.	Aliyense ndi bwenzi ndi wina aliyense.
And he did it.	Ndipo iye anachita izo.
Her doctor says she should.	Dokotala wake akuti ayenera.
He was not his.	Iye sanali wake.
I was very happy with this.	Ndinali wokondwa kwambiri ndi izi.
Everything was so good.	Zonse zinali zabwino kwambiri.
No one had.	Palibe amene anali nazo.
He has no car.	Alibe galimoto.
But people talk a lot.	Koma anthu amalankhula kwambiri.
This is true.	Izi ndi zoona.
He was pretty close to her now.	Iye anali pafupi naye ndithu tsopano.
I don't want him to do anything at all.	Sindikufuna kuti achite kalikonse konse.
But he is with me.	Koma ali ndi ine.
Everyone was going.	Aliyense anali kupita.
It wasn't hard.	Sizinali zovuta.
You are too young.	Ndiwe wamng'ono kwambiri.
Always now.	Nthawi zonse tsopano.
It's about luck, really.	Ndi za mwayi, kwenikweni.
She was beautiful.	Iye anali wokongola.
But it was not enough.	Koma sizinali zokwanira.
Sometimes there is music.	Nthawi zina pali nyimbo.
Hunger like us.	Njala ngati ife.
Some people do it often.	Anthu ena amachita nthawi zambiri.
Eyes know.	Maso akudziwa.
It's a girl.	Ndi mtsikana.
He knew everything.	Iye ankadziwa zonse .
And leave the rest.	Ndi kusiya ena onse.
Of course not!	Ayi ndithu, ndi vuto.
No one knows where he is now.	Palibe amene akudziwa kumene iye ali tsopano.
And now she is very happy.	Ndipo tsopano iye ali wokondwa kwambiri.
I love money.	Ndimakonda kwambiri ndalama.
Hence the fear.	Chifukwa chake mantha.
They did not want to come.	Iwo sanafune kubwera.
He will always be with him.	Adzakhala naye nthawi zonse.
I have it all.	Ndili ndi zonse.
He went to work on time.	Anapita kuntchito pa nthawi yake.
Maybe it was.	Mwina zinali .
It does not work.	Si ntchito.
I'm sure they can be.	Ine ndikutsimikiza iwo akhoza kukhala.
The music is good.	Nyimbo ndi zabwino.
You have to learn.	Muyenera kuphunzira.
Good luck !!.	Zabwino zonse!!.
But even then everyone thought he was his.	Koma ngakhale onse ankaganiza kuti iye ndi wake.
I have my life.	Ndili ndi moyo wanga.
And last night.	Ndipo usiku watha.
He says I am.	Akuti ndi.
My father went there when he was a boy.	Bambo anga anapita kumeneko ali mnyamata.
And they started.	Ndipo iwo anayamba.
It doesn't exist right now.	Izo palibe pakali pano.
It's a man's business.	Ndi ntchito ya mwamuna.

Therefore, it is.	Choncho, ndi.
Now you are mine.	Tsopano ndiwe wanga.
As he had none at all.	Monga analibe nkomwe.
As before.	Monga kale.

He was not alone in this.	Iye sanali yekha mu izi.
Because there is more.	Chifukwa pali zambiri.
Probably always.	Mwina nthawi zonse.
I know he wasn't.	Ndikudziwa kuti sanali.
One can tell him anything.	Munthu akhoza kumuuza chilichonse.
It doesn't matter to me.	Alibe ntchito kwa ine.
House this week.	Nyumba sabata ino.
You need to go to him.	Muyenera kupita kwa iye.
But no one would ever know.	Koma palibe amene akanatha kudziwa zomwe.

No one knows.	Palibe amene akudziwa.

But it was not true.	Koma sizinali zoona.

He was willing to do it alone.	Iye anali wokonzeka kuchita zimenezi yekha.
I knew that very well.	Ndinkadziwa kwambiri zimenezo.
They are not for you.	Iwo sali a inu.
It was really all he did.	Zinali kwenikweni zonse zomwe anachita.
He must have gone alone.	Ayenera kuti anapita yekha.

No one went with him.	Palibe amene anapita naye.
And very good reason.	Ndipo zabwino kwambiri chifukwa.

Best of all this method is good.	Zabwino kwambiri njira iyi ndi yabwino.
That's fine then.	Ndizo zabwino ndiye.
You have a family.	Muli ndi banja.
But it is interesting.	Koma ndi chidwi.
They both knew it.	Onse awiri ankadziwa izo.
She was one beautiful woman.	Anali mkazi mmodzi wokongola.
He could, be well.	Iye akanatha, kukhala bwino.
He did not know where or why.	Iye sankadziwa kumene kapena chifukwa.
Now he had no husband or wife.	Tsopano analibe mwamuna kapena mkazi.
Buying alcohol, everyone?	Kugula mowa, aliyense?
But then almost.	Koma ndiye pafupifupi.
But there are others.	Koma pali ena.
This is true for everyone.	Izi ndi zoona kwa aliyense.
He must do this alone.	Ayenera kuchita izi yekha.
I was there swimming.	Ndinali kumeneko kusambira.

What did he think? 	Kodi ankaganiza chiyani?

Maybe it was me.	Mwina ndinali ine.

I don't want to do anything but this.	Sindikufuna kuchita chilichonse koma izi.
I like eating.	Ndimakonda kudya.
He did not seem to be doing very well.	Ankaoneka kuti sanali bwino kwenikweni.
Nobody knew anything about it.	Palibe amene ankadziwa kalikonse za izo.
Well, you know all about it.	Chabwino, inu mukudziwa zonse za izo.
He was not ready.	Iye sanali wokonzeka.
He did not know because of what he did.	Iye sankadziwa chifukwa cha zomwe iye anachita.
I deserve this.	Ndiyenera izi.
Even the police.	Ngakhale apolisi.
He was a good man.	Anali munthu wabwino.
Like my father.	Monga bambo anga.
You can skip this.	Mutha kusiya izi.
I thought he was lucky.	Ndinkaganiza kuti anali ndi mwayi.
It's in all of us.	Ili mwa ife tonse.
That wasn't very good.	Izo sizinali zabwino kwambiri.
If not more.	Ngati palibe zambiri.

And he knows everyone who they are.	Ndipo amadziwa aliyense amene ali aliyense.
Of course not!	Ayi ndithu.
I'm alone here today.	Ndine ndekha pano lero.
It is a matter of time.	Ndi nkhani ya nthawi.
It's a lot of curiosity.	Ndi zambiri za chidwi.
He can just do that.	Iye akhoza basi kuchita zimenezo.
I was worried about you.	Ndinali ndi nkhawa za inu.
I do not like this method.	Sindimakonda njira iyi.
It's my family.	Ndi banja langa.
You need to get better.	Muyenera kupeza bwino.
I do not know who my father was.	Sindikudziwa kuti bambo anga anali ndani.
But he was a friend.	Koma anali bwenzi.
And you need to know why.	Ndipo muyenera kudziwa chifukwa chake.
She was beautiful, almost beautiful.	Anali wokongola, pafupifupi wokongola.
But, he was.	Koma, iye anali.
He is my friend.	Iye ndi bwenzi langa.
I wanted to be near you.	Ndinkafuna kukhala pafupi nanu.
Maybe I heard about him.	Mwina ndinamva za iye.
But it was not to be.	Koma sizinali kutero.
He likes to be alone.	Amakonda kukhala yekha.
Now is your time.	Tsopano ndi nthawi yanu.
But he didn't have it today.	Koma iye analibe izo lero.
This was good for me.	Izi zinali zabwino kwa ine.
And he said to me.	Ndipo adati kwa ine.
He always wanted to do it for himself.	Nthawi zonse ankafuna kuchita za iye yekha.
And who was he.	Ndipo anali ndani.
One does not.	Mmodzi alibe.
I am so happy to be a father.	Ndine wokondwa kwambiri kukhala bambo.
He did not want to do that.	Iye sankafuna kutero.
It was so.	Zinali choncho.
He had a wife and children.	Anali ndi mkazi ndi ana.
This he could not do.	Izi sanathe kuchita.
As if we could not do this without him.	Monga ngati sitingathe kuchita izi popanda iye.
I need help, here.	Ndikufuna thandizo, pano.
You do not have to do this.	Simuyenera kuchita izi.
He never did.	Iye sanachite nkomwe.
I feel like it was.	Ndikumva ngati zinali.
You have to buy food.	Muyenera kugula chakudya.
I love my life so much.	Ndimakonda kwambiri moyo wanga.
He does not have much money.	Alibe ndalama zambiri.
His eyes.	Maso ake .
There is not much to do.	Palibe kuchita zambiri.
He must have had it.	Iye ayenera kuti anali nazo.
It was because of fear.	Zinali chifukwa cha mantha.
But he can.	Koma akhoza basi.
Only one woman did not panic.	Mkazi mmodzi yekhayo sanachite mantha.
Man, man, man.	Munthu, munthu, munthu.
As in two people.	Monga mwa anthu awiri.
She was quite beautiful.	Iye anali wokongola ndithu.
I am a good person.	Ndine munthu wabwino.
I thought of something.	Ndinaganiza zina.
There they are.	Ndi iwo ndi iwo.
No one knew.	Palibe amene ankadziwa.
A man? 	Mwamuna?
.	.
It was, perhaps, all he could do.	Zinali, mwina, zonse zomwe akanatha kuchita.
Of course not!	Ayi ndithu.
Something you know.	Chinachake chomwe mukudziwa.
My father was like that.	Bambo anga anali choncho.
Your no is only for you.	Ayi yanu ili ndi inu nokha.
But this was not always the case.	Koma sizinali choncho nthawi zonse.
Always good.	Nthawi zonse zabwino.
I thought well of it.	Ndinaganiza bwino za izo.
Music, lyrics, and stories.	Nyimbo, mawu, ndi nkhani.
My son is everything to me.	Mwana wanga ndiye zonse kwa ine.
Then the time is already over.	Ndiye nthawi yatha kale.
He knows where they are.	Iye amadziwa kumene iwo ali.
That's great.	Ndi zabwino kwambiri.
Or in the last week.	Kapena mu sabata yatha.
I feel better without it.	Ndikumva bwino popanda izo.
Every one of them.	Aliyense wa iwo.
That is why no one talks about him.	Ndicho chifukwa chake palibe amene amalankhula za iye.
I want you to stay.	Ndikufuna kukhala.
He'll have it.	Iye adzakhala nazo izo.
That was very good.	Izo zinali zabwino kwambiri.
Well, it's food.	Chabwino, ndi chakudya.
It's a meeting.	Ndi msonkhano.
He was younger than me.	Anali wamng'ono kwa ine.
I always enjoy helping people.	Nthawi zonse ndimakonda kuthandiza anthu.
Sounds good.	Zikuwoneka ngati zabwino.
He told me that.	Anandiuza kuti .
Or they may have thought that he was a good man.	Kapena iwo ankaganiza kuti ndi munthu.
It was scary.	Zinali mantha.
That is why you should always do things that you know.	Chifukwa chake muyenera kuchita zinthu zomwe mukudziwa nthawi zonse.
He was an expert.	Iye anali katswiri.
All for no reason.	Zonse popanda chifukwa.
The police know this.	Apolisi amadziwa izi.
This was not what he had expected.	Izi sizinali zomwe ankayembekezera.
But that was not enough for them.	Koma zimenezo sizinali zokwanira kwa iwo.
And it is certainly true.	Ndipo ndi zoona ndithu.
She was just a girl.	Anali mtsikana basi.
I'm sorry.	Ndikumva chisoni.
I'll stay here.	Ndikhala pano.
Here is my answer.	Yankho langa ndi ili.
We are interested in two of them.	Tili ndi chidwi ndi awiri a iwo.
He is the only one who does not have it.	Ndi iye yekha amene alibe.
Or with other people.	Kapena ndi anthu ena.
But he was already down to that.	Koma iye anali kale pansi izo.
I doubt he plans to do so.	Ndikukayika kuti akukonzekera kutero.
He was here now.	Iye anali pano tsopano.
No one knows what to do, everyone is scared.	Palibe amene akudziwa choti achite, aliyense amachita mantha.
He was sure he knew exactly what he knew.	Anali wotsimikiza kuti amadziwa bwino zomwe anali kudziwa.
he thought.	iye anaganiza.
He needs to know tomorrow.	Ayenera kudziwa mawa.
He must have been in something.	Ayenera kuti anali mu chinachake.
He was neither young nor beautiful.	Iye sanali wamng’ono kapena wokongola.
Apparently not.	Zikuoneka kuti sizinali choncho.
Maybe he went alone.	Mwina anapita yekha.
He is so big.	Iye ndi wamkulu kwambiri.
It's really good.	Ndi zabwino kwenikweni.
Anyone can blame anyone else.	Aliyense akhoza kuimba mlandu wina aliyense.

It was very difficult.	Zinali zovuta kwambiri.
Good job so far.	Ntchito yabwino mpaka pano.
He was a man to me.	Iye anali munthu kwa ine.
Good student.	Wophunzira wabwino.

I think it's good to be both.	Ndikuganiza kuti ndi zabwino kukhala onse awiri.
They were all yours.	Onse anali anu.
One like me.	Mmodzi ngati ine.
Then they started working.	Ndiye iwo anayamba ntchito.
I love her hair like that.	Ndimakonda tsitsi lake monga choncho.

It was, it was that.	Izo zinali, izo zinali izo.
No one else does that.	Palibe wina aliyense amene amachita zimenezo.
You think so.	Mukuganiza kwambiri.
They were coming to him.	Iwo anali kubwera kwa iye.
Two days, three days.	Masiku awiri, masiku atatu.
What do everyone else think ?.	Ena onse akuganiza bwanji?.
He wanted to say.	Iye ankafuna kunena.
There really is.	Pali kwenikweni.
You need to know about this.	Muyenera kudziwa za izi.
He was curious.	Iye anali ndi chidwi.
Prison in his mind.	Mndende mu malingaliro ake.
That's all he has.	Ndizo zonse zomwe ali nazo.
Now he wondered why.	Tsopano anadabwa chifukwa chake.
It's one way tonight.	Ndi njira imodzi usikuuno.
A little worried.	Nkhawa pang'ono.
I've been busy.	Ndakhala wotanganidwa.
There is nothing better than a house.	Palibe chabwino kuposa nyumba.
But as one man he lived many lives.	Koma monga munthu mmodzi anakhala ndi moyo ambiri.
For others not.	Kwa ena ayi.
He can do it tonight.	Akhoza kuchita izo usikuuno.
They did not know that they had a problem.	Iwo sankadziwa kuti ali ndi vuto.
He has both eyes.	Iye ndi maso onse.
He's not really on it.	Iye sali kwenikweni pa izo.
Many, many things.	Zinthu zambiri, zambiri.
He can't do nothing.	Iye sangachite kalikonse.
They do it because someone has to.	Iwo amachita izo chifukwa winawake ayenera kutero.
I like to tell stories like this.	Ndimakonda kunena nkhani ngati izi.
Who is nearby.	Amene ali pafupi.
Good food and work.	Chakudya chabwino ndi ntchito.
Everyone loves to win.	Aliyense amakonda kupambana.
Many are not.	Ambiri sali.
I want something.	Ndikufuna chinachake .
You are alone.	Muli nokha.
I like living out here.	Ndimakonda kukhala kunja kuno.
Or he did not care.	Kapena analibe nazo ntchito.
He was impressed.	Anachita chidwi.
For another night.	Kwa usiku wina.
I can't drive a car.	Sindingathe kuyendetsa galimoto.
I'm fine with this.	Ndili bwino ndi izi.
Now he was awake.	Tsopano anali maso.

But she is not happy.	Koma iye sali wokondwa.
He was doing my job tonight.	Anali kugwira ntchito yanga usikuuno.
I do not know where he is.	Sindikudziwa komwe ali.
Life is good !!.	Moyo ndi wabwino!!.
Many did not do well.	Ambiri sanachite bwino.
Everything else looks like before.	Zina zonse zikuwoneka ngati kale.
He lived with him and his parents.	Anakhala naye limodzi ndi makolo ake.
Well, it could have been him.	Chabwino, akanatha kukhala iye.

But no one should know.	Koma palibe amene ayenera kudziwa.

Therefore, no children.	Choncho, palibe ana.

Feeling daily.	Kumva tsiku lililonse.
And that he was probably working with a woman.	Ndipo kuti mwina anali kugwira ntchito ndi mkazi.
And when.	Ndipo pamene .
But he was right.	Koma anali kunena zoona.
Or a woman.	Kapena mkazi.

But she is OK.	Koma ali bwino.

Because of him.	Chifukwa cha iye.
For one it is food.	Kwa wina ndi chakudya.
He was terrified.	Anachita mantha kwambiri.
Money was everything.	Ndalama zinali zonse.

No one knows that.	Palibe amene akudziwa zimenezo.
She did not want a baby.	Sanafune mwana.
His dog was big and was not a dog at all.	Galu wake anali wamkulu ndipo sanali galu nkomwe.
That's what he wants.	Ndicho chimene iye akufuna.
But now.	Koma tsopano.
He never had another wife in his life.	Iye analibe mkazi wina mu moyo wake.
Please !.	Chonde!.
For a long time he was alone.	Kwa nthawi yaitali anali yekha.

And there is none.	Ndipo izo palibe.
I love my home.	Ndimakonda nyumba yanga.

But it was like another song.	Koma zinali ngati nyimbo ina.

There is no other way.	Palibe njira ina.
You know that well.	Inu mukudziwa bwino izo.

This is all up to me.	Izi zonse ndi ine.
Living with them.	Kukhala nazo.
He may not be able to be alone.	Mwina sangathe kukhala yekha.

I was ready to be alone.	Ndinali wokonzeka kukhala ndekha.
He wasn't in it.	Iye sanali mu izo.

Those were very difficult years.	Izo zinali zaka zovuta kwambiri.

No guilt, no sorrow.	Palibe mlandu, palibe chisoni.

There is no life, or life.	Palibe moyo, kapena moyo.
But it really wasn't too hard.	Koma kwenikweni sizinali zovuta kwambiri.
You are my friend.	Ndiwe bwenzi langa.
Female or male.	Mkazi kapena mwamuna.
Close enough, he thought.	Pafupi mokwanira, iye ankaganiza.
But sometimes they do well.	Koma nthawi zina amachita bwino.
We must say it clearly.	Tiyenera kunena bwino.
This is her story.	Iyi ndi nkhani yake.

Apparently he often thought about it.	Zikuoneka kuti nthawi zambiri ankaganiza za izo.
But someone else has to do it.	Koma wina ayenera kutero.
Sorry about that.	Pepani chifukwa chake.
They were at home.	Iwo anali kunyumba.

You know it isn't.	Inu mukudziwa kuti sichoncho.
He was going too fast.	Iye anali kupita mofulumira kwambiri.

My father is a doctor.	Bambo anga ndi dokotala.
He was not awake.	Iye sanali maso.
Even other stories.	Ngakhale nkhani zina.
But he was very surprised.	Koma anadabwa kwambiri.

He was a very good man.	Anali munthu wabwino kwenikweni.

Many of them.	Ambiri a iwo.
It was almost working.	Zinali pafupifupi kugwira ntchito.

And the parents were the parents.	Ndipo makolo anali makolo.

The story for him, too, appears.	Nkhani kwa iye, nayenso, zikuoneka.
But I am the only one.	Koma ndi ine ndekha.
One down and two going.	Mmodzi pansi ndi awiri kupita.
He lived his life in them.	Iye anakhala moyo wake mwa iwo.
He looked down.	Iye anayang'ana pansi.
No one else does that.	Palibe wina aliyense amene amachita zimenezo.
There is nothing that anyone can do.	Palibe chimene aliyense angachite.
And he wasn't ready to do that.	Ndipo iye sanali wokonzeka kuchita zimenezo.
Often, but sometimes.	Nthawi zambiri, koma nthawi zina.
All he is.	Zonse zomwe iye ali.
That's why the other way around.	Ndi chifukwa chake njira ina.
He did not need any help.	Sanafune thandizo lililonse.
Even better than me, it's you.	Ngakhale kuposa ine, ndi inu.

Just what he says.	Zomwe akunena basi.
Because they are not.	Chifukwa iwo sali.
They do not know why we should go there.	Sakudziwa chifukwa chake tiyenera kupita kumeneko.
But sometimes you just have to do what you have to do.	Koma nthawi zina muyenera kuchita zomwe muyenera kuchita.
That's what he should be.	Ndicho chimene iye ayenera.
To this day, there are no words.	Mpaka pano, palibe mawu.
All right, that's fine.	Chabwino, ndizo zabwino.

And now all this.	Ndipo tsopano zonse izi.

It was a lot, dad.	Zinali zambiri, bambo.
He was positive, too.	Iye anali wotsimikiza, nayenso.
My wife and children have already left.	Mkazi wanga ndi ana anga anapita kale.

Everyone should run this.	Aliyense ayenera kuyendetsa izi.
In most cases, it would be better.	Nthawi zambiri, zingakhale bwino.
Her life is good.	Moyo wake ndi wabwino.
I do not want to go.	Sindikufuna kupita.
But there is a sense.	Koma pali maganizo.

He may be here.	Iye akhoza kukhala pano.
And that's why.	Ndipo ndi chifukwa.

But she is still alive.	Koma akadali ndi moyo.

Then he thinks well.	Ndiye akuganiza bwino.
I've been thinking about it all day.	Ndakhala ndikuganiza za izo tsiku lonse.

But there is no word for everyone.	Koma palibe mawu kwa aliyense.
But she will be happy.	Koma iye adzakhala wokondwa.
They like to eat dog food.	Amakonda kudya chakudya cha galu.

He can have his way with her.	Iye akhoza kukhala ndi njira yake ndi iye.

And he will certainly be happy.	Ndipo ndithu, adzakhala wokondwa.
To her great surprise, she was ready.	Anadabwa kwambiri kuti anali wokonzeka.

Basically everything.	Kwenikweni zonse.

You do not have to say sorry.	Simuyenera kunena pepani.
No one came to him.	Palibe amene anabwera kwa iye.
He may have had a wife.	Mwina anali ndi mkazi.
But she was happy too.	Koma nayenso anasangalala.
This is not your problem.	Ili si vuto lanu.

All the best with it.	Zabwino zonse ndi izo.
You can't do that.	Simungathe kuchita zimenezo.
From a friend.	Kuchokera kwa bwenzi.

One every day.	Mmodzi tsiku lililonse.
You need to find another way.	Muyenera kupeza njira ina.
No one is doing anything.	Palibe amene akuchita chilichonse.
This was about money.	Izi zinali za ndalama.

And he knew that he was not alone.	Ndipo ankadziwa kuti sanali yekha.

She was immediately terrified.	Nthawi yomweyo anachita mantha.

Why did he do so?	N’chifukwa chiyani anachita zimenezi?
That's exactly right.	Ndizo zoona ndithu.
Good job.	Ntchito yabwino.

Things did not go well.	Zinthu sizinali bwino.

They were worried about me.	Iwo anali ndi nkhawa za ine.
Baby her a little.	Mwana iye pang'ono.

But these were difficult times.	Koma izi zinali nthawi zovuta.
This is true.	Izi ndi zoona.
