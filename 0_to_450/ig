In this way, officials, if you like.	N'ụzọ dị otú a, ndị isi, ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị.

My wife went there to help these people.	Nwunye m gara ebe ahụ inyere ndị a aka.
His attitude is beautiful.	Omume ya mara mma.
This could not be more true.	Nke a enweghị ike ịbụ eziokwu karịa.
In his eyes.	Na anya ya.
He asked her.	Ọ jụrụ ya.
However, the situation is still far from ideal.	Otú ọ dị, ọnọdụ ahụ ka dị anya site na nke kacha mma.
Seeing so much violence shocked me.	Ịhụ ọtụtụ ihe ike mere m obi.
That is great these days.	Nke ahụ dị ukwuu ụbọchị ndị a.

No one made the game.	Ọ dịghị onye mere egwuregwu ahụ.
The game ended well in the story.	Egwuregwu ahụ kwụsịrị nke ọma na akụkọ ahụ.
Someone here knows how to play music.	Onye otu ebe a maara ka esi egwu egwu.

Hours and hours of time.	Oge awa na awa nke oge.

The workers felt that their wages were too low.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ chere na ụgwọ ọrụ ha adịghị mma nke ukwuu.

A lot of people think he is the greatest player.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-eche na ọ bụ onye na-egwu egwu kacha ukwuu.

A girl is sitting in the back of a store.	Otu nwa agbọghọ nọ ọdụ n'azụ ụlọ ahịa.

Well, he thought.	Dị mma, ọ chere.
The water is still running.	Mmiri ahụ ka na-agba agba.
Obesity in this country is alarming.	Ọrịa oke ibu na mba a dị egwu.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
Then sit down with the family and make plans.	Mgbe ahụ, nọdụ ezinụlọ ma mee atụmatụ.

No matter what he said, it would be wrong.	N'agbanyeghị ihe o kwuru, ọ ga-abụ ihe ọjọọ.
Nice to meet you.	Obi dị m ụtọ ịhụ gị.

Sometimes they do not know what to do next.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha amaghị ihe ha ga-eme ọzọ.
He did not know when.	Ọ maghị oge ọ bụ.
No one else did that to you.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ mere gị ihe ahụ.
The boy's wife seems angry.	Nwunye nwa nwoke ahụ yiri ka iwe were ya.
It's pretty simple.	Ọ mara mma dị mfe.
They have different roles.	Ha nwere ọrụ dị iche iche.
This time, through his eyes.	Oge a, site na anya ya.
But it is the least of our problems.	Ma ọ bụ nke kacha nta nke nsogbu anyị.
I can not be sure of anything.	M ike kwere n'aka nke ihe.
The room itself is important.	Ime ụlọ n'onwe ya dị mkpa.
He probably had nowhere else to go.	O nwere ike ịbụ na o nweghị ebe ọzọ ọ ga-aga.
We have a company.	Anyị nwere ụlọ ọrụ.
It is obviously the most expensive.	O doro anya na ọ bụ ya kacha ọnụ.

Clearly, he was very interested.	N'ụzọ doro anya, ọ nwere mmasị dị ukwuu.

He loves what he loves.	Ọ na-enwe mmasị n'ihe ọ hụrụ n'anya.

His face was very angry.	Ihu ya were iwe nke ukwuu.

We have food, water.	Anyị nwere nri, mmiri.
They looked back only once, and then left quickly.	Ha lere anya azụ naanị otu ugboro, wee pụọ ngwa ngwa.
I just started to cry.	M ka malitere ibe ákwá.
I was not ready to leave.	Adịghị m njikere ịpụ.
But what they really want is to make everything different.	Mana ihe ha chọrọ n'ezie bụ ka ihe niile dị iche.
Still, they don't play big games when they need to.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ha emeghị nnukwu egwuregwu mgbe ọ dị ha mkpa.
I want it to be true.	Ọ dị m ka ya bụrụ eziokwu.
This is the first thing he has done.	Nke a bụ nke mbụ o mere.

So he doesn't know what you are like.	N’ihi ya, ọ maghị otú ị dị.
He was with me then.	Ọ nọ na m mgbe ahụ.
People are still talking about it.	Ndị mmadụ ka na-ekwu maka ya.

He is afraid.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya.
Better safe.	Mma ka mma.
They are very useful.	Ha bara ezigbo uru.
But for now, this time.	Ma maka ugbu a, n'oge a.
The river is alive.	Osimiri ahụ dị ndụ.
Others are the same.	Ndị ọzọ bụ otu ihe ahụ.
But in time, his interest diminished.	Ma ka oge na-aga, mmasị ya kwụsịrị.
Either way, much worse for them.	Kedu ụzọ ọ bụla, nke ukwuu ka njọ maka ha.
There are windows.	Enwere windo.
The fever caused him to eat.	Ahụ ọkụ ahụ mere ka ọ rie nri.
Then it came to me, they wanted one.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ bịara m, ha chọrọ otu.
Everyone else did the same.	Otú ahụ ka onye ọ bụla ọzọ mere.
My favorite place is near the beach.	Ebe kacha amasị m dị nso n'akụkụ osimiri.

The food was very good.	Nri ahụ dị ezigbo mma.
Then it goes to the window.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ na-aga na windo.
It is possible.	Ọ bụ omume.

And a new challenge.	Na ihe ịma aka ọhụrụ.
He should not give it twice.	O kwesịghị inye ya ugboro abụọ.

But not for long.	Ma ọ bụghị ruo ogologo oge.
It is always a promise at the same time.	Ọ bụ mgbe niile nkwa n'otu oge.
It was a little scary, but it was funny.	Ọ tụrụ ntakịrị ụjọ, mana ọ bụ ọchị.
It would be wrong to do so.	Ọ ga-abụ ihe ọjọọ ime.
Clothing there is expensive.	Uwe dị n'ebe ahụ dị oke ọnụ.

That is not a question.	Nke ahụ abụghị ajụjụ.

His behavior was not good.	Omume ya adịghị mma.

Happiness is in front of him.	Obi ụtọ dị n'ihu ya.
The car continued.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ gara n'ihu.
What matters is how you react when it does.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ ka i si eme ihe mgbe o mere.
The supermarket is on fire.	Nnukwu ụlọ ahịa na-agba ọkụ.
He did what he wanted in any way.	O mere ihe ọ chọrọ n'ụzọ ọ bụla.

He thinks he has no sense of humor.	Ọ na-eche na o nweghị ihe ọchị.
He should go for it as soon as possible.	Ọ ga-aga ya ngwa ngwa o kwere mee.
You do not, but.	Ị naghị, ma.
It seems that the only person who is upset here is you.	Ọ dị ka naanị onye iwe ebe a bụ gị.
Not everyone will like you, period.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla ga-amasị gị, oge.
But now he is free.	Ma ugbu a ọ nwere onwe ya.
I can see the height can be scary.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ka elu nwere ike isi na-atụ egwu.
The bride looks like her mother.	Nwunye ahụ yiri uwe nne ya.
However, they are beautiful.	Otú ọ dị, ha mara mma.
There is good money to be made there.	Enwere ezigbo ego a ga-eme ebe ahụ.
Once it enters into us it can never go out.	Ozugbo ọ banyere n'ime anyị nwere ike ọ dịghị mgbe ịpụ.

Her clothes are not like those of her mother.	Uwe ya adịghị ka nke nne ya.
We all owe you.	Anyị niile ji gị ụgwọ.
He did this for weeks.	O mere nke a ruo ọtụtụ izu.
Because he was still young.	N'ihi na ọ ka bụ nwata.
If he does, he could use it to benefit others.	Ọ bụrụ na o mere ya, o nwere ike iji ya mee ndị ọzọ.

No one saw anything bad in it.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ihe ọjọọ na ya.

He could not do it.	O nweghị ike ime ya.
We left a letter at his door, but nothing.	Anyị hapụrụ akwụkwọ ozi n'ọnụ ụzọ ya, ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla.
He never left his home for years.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ hapụrụ ụlọ ya ruo ọtụtụ afọ.
But the money would be fine.	Ma ego ahụ ga-adị mma.

He tried not to do it but he could not.	Ọ gbalịrị ka ọ ghara ime ya ma o nweghị ike ime ya.

You know that.	Ị maara nke ahụ.
Many, many people have died.	Ọtụtụ mmadụ nwụrụ.

The people here are very hungry.	Ndị bi ebe a na-enwe oke agụụ.
He was afraid to talk.	Ọ tụrụ egwu ikwu okwu.
The house thought it was there.	Ụlọ ahụ chere na ọ dị.
His humor is not friendly.	Ọchị ọchị ya anaghị eme enyi.

Few people understand that.	Ọ bụ mmadụ ole na ole ghọtara okwu ahụ.
It is done because people expect it to happen.	A na-eme ya n'ihi na ndị mmadụ na-atụ anya na ọ ga-eme.
He was amazed at the thought of hopelessness.	Echiche nke enweghị olileanya juru ya anya.
Behind him comes again.	N'azụ ya na-abịa ọzọ.
They asked me a very important question.	Ha jụrụ m otu ajụjụ dị ezigbo mkpa.
There is no reason for it.	O nweghị ihe kpatara ya.

Everyone was sitting and everyone else.	Onye ọ bụla nọ ọdụ na onye ọ bụla ọzọ.

The man on the right nodded to the other.	Nwoke aka nri kwere onye nke ọzọ isi.

I really want to be here.	Achọrọ m ya n'ezie ịnọ ebe a.
He traveled a lot.	Ọ gara ọtụtụ ebe.
But there seems to be more to it than that.	Mana ọ dị ka enwere ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
We can't do it without your help.	Anyị enweghị ike ime ya na-enweghị enyemaka gị.
To take action.	Ime ihe.
That is not easy to find.	Nke ahụ adịghị mfe ịchọta.
But no one seems to care.	Ma o yiri ka ọ dịghị onye ọ na-eche banyere ya.
She was close to knowing his head.	Ọ nọ nso ka ọ mara isi ya.

You don’t seem to have a job interview.	Ọ dịghị ka ị nwere ajụjụ ọnụ ọrụ.

I do not know anything else about this spirit.	Amaghị m ihe ọ bụla ọzọ gbasara mmụọ a.
You should go now.	Ị kwesịrị ịga ugbu a.
Many hated me so much, they refused.	Ọtụtụ kpọrọ m asị nke ukwuu, ha jụrụ.
I can't find one.	Enweghị m ike ịchọta otu.
I was there when everything went smoothly.	Anọ m ebe ahụ mgbe ihe niile na-aga.
The problem is his best friend.	Nsogbu bụ ezigbo enyi ya.
The weather and the perfect view.	Ihu igwe na echiche zuru oke.
That was the beginning of his career.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe malitere ọrụ ya n'ezie.
There is no need to consult.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ịgba izu.
His hand fell too hard.	Aka ya dara nke ukwuu.
There is so much to do.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe ime.
Because no one really knows what is going to happen to him.	N'ihi na ọ dịghị onye maara nke ọma ihe a ga-eme ya.
So he was.	Ya mere, ọ nọ.
Many people reject these rules.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ jụrụ iwu ndị a.
Everyone is waiting for it.	Onye ọ bụla na-eche ya.
Whatever it is that will happen.	Ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ nke ahụ ga-eme.

He thinks he knows it now.	O chere na ya maara otú ahụ ugbu a.
It works on anything.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ na ihe ọ bụla.

Still, he thought.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ chere.
There is no fire in it.	Ọkụ adịghị n'ime ya.
But he was not the only one alive.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị ya ka ọ dị ndụ.
They are not the way you want them to be.	Ha abụghị otú ị chọrọ ka ha dị.

He recognized her immediately from his photos.	Ọ maara ya ozugbo site na foto ya.
Food was his first priority.	Ihe oriri bụ ihe mbụ ọ chọrọ.
Tomorrow will be better than today, that is for sure.	Echi ga-adị mma karịa taa, nke ahụ bụ n'ezie.
A lot of things happened in a few days.	Ọtụtụ ihe mere n'ime ụbọchị ole na ole.
Each season is unique and new.	Oge ọ bụla pụrụ iche na nke ọhụrụ.
But then, nothing will happen.	Ma mgbe ahụ, ọ dịghị ihe ga-adị.

He's a good man, he's really good.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ, ọ dị mma n'ezie.

He caused a lot of trouble during that time.	O kpatara ọtụtụ nsogbu n'oge ahụ.
Thinking first, doing second.	Iche echiche mbụ, ime nke abụọ.
Have a party at any time.	Mee oriri na ọṅụṅụ n'oge ọ bụla.
We did, we tried.	Anyị mere, anyị gbalịrị.
We do not know the truth of what happened now.	Anyị agaghị ama eziokwu nke ihe mere ugbu a.
He advised them not to use drugs.	Ọ gwara ha ka ha ghara iji ọgwụ ọjọọ eme ihe.
You do not know how a book will work.	Ị maghị otú akwụkwọ ga-esi eme.
No, just no.	Mba, naanị mba.
Great game for us.	Nnukwu egwuregwu maka anyị.
Water drinks.	Ihe ọṅụṅụ mmiri.

It may be different for someone else.	O nwere ike ịdị iche maka onye ọzọ.

It seems to be working now.	Ọ dị ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ ugbu a.
The message is clear.	Ozi ahụ doro anya.
Long time required.	Ogologo oge na-achọ.
Evil came.	Ihe ọjọọ wee bịa.
The statement is pointless.	Okwu ahụ enweghị isi.
What I am saying is this.	Ihe m na-ekwu bụ nke a.
Elsewhere, they are quite different.	N'ebe ndị ọzọ, ha dị nnọọ iche.
You have to go.	Ị ga-aga.
Her eyes are so beautiful.	Anya ya mara mma nke ukwuu.
He sat firm.	Ọ nọdụ siri ike.

We must do our will.	Anyị kwesịrị ime uche anyị.
It is so close.	Ọ nọ nso mere.

There is such a story of a couple.	Enwere akụkọ di na nwunye dị otú ahụ.
So we did not do the village.	Ya mere, anyị emeghị obodo nta.
She seems to enjoy being around me.	O yiri ka ọ̀ na-atọ ya ụtọ ịnọ m nso.
We started the trial here.	Anyị malitere ikpe ebe a.
We are happy.	Obi dị anyị ụtọ.
He is known for his courage.	A maara ya maka obi ike ya.
That's why we were there in the first place.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị ji nọrọ ebe ahụ na mbụ.
You are twenty.	Ị dị iri abụọ.
His name is incomparable.	Aha ya enweghị atụ.
By people like them.	Site na ndị dị ka ha.
I like your movie.	Ihe nkiri gị na-amasị m.
I think maybe he is inside.	Echere m ma eleghị anya ọ nọ n'ime.
I think you probably don't care.	Echere m ma eleghị anya ị chọghị ịma.
Among other things, that is.	Ihe ndị ọzọ, ya bụ.
But then he understood something.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ ghọtara ihe.
To do what pleases him.	Ime ihe na-amasị ya.
I'm glad to see so many of you here today.	Obi dị m ụtọ ịhụ ọtụtụ n'ime unu ebe a taa.
That will be my job.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ọrụ m.
But no one was willing to talk about it.	Ma ọ dịghị onye dị njikere ikwu banyere ya.
Its history made it a household name.	Akụkọ ihe mere eme ya mere ka aha ya bụrụ okwu ezinụlọ.
It was a feeling she shared with her son.	Ọ bụ mmetụta ọ gwara nwa ya nwoke.
If not, most people will.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị, ọtụtụ mmadụ ga-eme ya.
The only thing is.	Naanị ihe bụ.
Not so long ago it was the same.	Ọ bụghị ogologo oge gara aga ka ọ bụ otu ihe ahụ.
He loves her very much.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
The obvious thing.	Ihe doro anya.
My husband cooked to give me a break.	Di m siri nri ka o nye m ezumike.
Two basic requirements in each car.	Isi ihe abụọ a chọrọ na ụgbọ ala ọ bụla.
Everything works fine.	Ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
We have a game plan.	Anyị nwere atụmatụ egwuregwu.
Only a few of them stayed longer.	Ọ bụ ole na ole n'ime ha nọrọ ogologo oge.
She knew that life began at conception.	Ọ maara na ndụ malitere mgbe a tụrụ ime.
Two of them died.	Mmadụ abụọ n’ime ha nwụrụ.
It is bad for them.	Ọ dị njọ maka ha.
But you do not see it very well.	Mana ị naghị ahụ ya nke ukwuu.
But that is my worst case scenario.	Ma nke ahụ bụ oke ikpe m.
They are one.	Ha bụ otu.
Your story is good.	Akụkọ gị dị mma.
I can see the power.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ike ahụ.
I was on my own.	Anọ m n'akụkụ onwe m.
It’s still a game, just a different kind.	Ọ ka bụ otu egwuregwu, naanị ụdị dị iche.
They know where we are.	Ha ma ebe anyị nọ.
Many thanks for everything !.	Ọtụtụ daalụ maka ihe niile!.
We are all waiting.	Anyị niile na-eche.
You run things here in the city.	Ị na-agba ihe ebe a na obodo.
It is a very important human thing.	Ọ bụ ihe bara nnukwu uru nke mmadụ.
Our task then was simple.	Ọrụ anyị mgbe ahụ bụ nke dị mfe.
We want to get people to do what we want them to do.	Anyị chọrọ ime ka ndị mmadụ mee ihe anyị chọrọ.
That is what you need.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ị chọrọ.
He knows me well.	Ọ maara nke ọma m.
She is in tears.	Anya mmiri juru ya anya.
He thought it would be so.	O chere na ọ ga-adị otú ahụ.
This made the weather very nice.	Nke a mere ka ihu igwe dị mma nke ukwuu.
They just like going to work.	Ha na-amasị naanị ịga ọrụ.
This method will be very busy.	Ụzọ a ga-enwe nnọọ ọrụ n'aka.
There are no complete plans.	Ọ nweghị atụmatụ zuru oke.
I have just arrived home.	M ka rutere n'ụlọ.
Did you hear the story?	Ị nụrụ akụkọ ahụ?
Today, everyone does everything.	Taa, onye ọ bụla na-eme ihe niile.
However, it can prevent people from speaking freely.	Otú ọ dị, o nwere ike ime ka ndị mmadụ ghara ikwu okwu otú ọ chọrọ.
It is not.	Ọ bụghị ya.
But this should not be the case.	Ma nke a ekwesịghị ịdị otú ahụ.
He looked closely at his hand.	O lere aka ya anya nke ọma.
Tomorrow will not be bad.	Echi agaghị adị njọ.
It is important to be different.	Ọ dị mkpa ịdị iche.
They know we are not in an easy time.	Ha maara na anyị anọghị n'oge dị mfe na ya.
It will not be the same now.	Agaghị adị otu ugbu a ụbọchị.
I know it feels really good.	Ama m na ọ dị ezigbo mma.
These are expensive.	Ndị a dị oke ọnụ.
They said long.	Ha kwuru ogologo oge.
Their music is unique.	Egwu ha pụrụ iche.
This is funny.	Nke a na-atọ ọchị.
Not around me.	Ọ bụghị gburugburu m.
The road is not good here.	Ụzọ ahụ adịghị mma ebe a.
I have not had a friend since I was a child.	Enweghị m enyi kemgbe m bụ nwata.
I think he was very scared.	Echere m na ụjọ tụrụ ya nke ukwuu.
No real name.	Enweghị aha n'ezie.
One day, he came.	Otu ụbọchị, ọ bịara.
Other staff here do not have this problem.	Ndị ọrụ ndị ọzọ ebe a enweghị nsogbu a.
These are new.	Ndị a dị ọhụrụ.
We will both do.	Anyị abụọ ga-eme.
Many species are still at risk.	Ọtụtụ ụdị ka nọ n'ihe egwu.
I can't speak right now.	Enweghị m ike ikwu okwu ugbu a.
And here too, we have a sense of community.	Na ebe a kwa, anyị nwere mmetụta nke obodo.
I try to do whatever it takes to be happy.	M na-agbalị ime ihe ọ bụla na-eme m obi ụtọ.
Some of us have seen that.	Ụfọdụ n’ime anyị hụrụ nke ahụ.
No, yesterday was yesterday.	Mba, ụbọchị gara aga ụnyahụ.
It's not me thinking.	Ọ bụghị m ka ọ na-eche.
Not everyone can do it.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla nwere ike ime ya.
He needs it every night, no matter what.	Ọ chọrọ ya kwa abalị, n'agbanyeghị ihe.
He expected all of that.	Ọ tụrụ anya ihe ahụ niile.
Father all the time.	Nna oge niile.
They have no one, there is no reason for it.	Ha enweghị otu, ọ nweghị ihe kpatara ya.
They made us do it again.	Ha mere ka anyị mee ya ọzọ.
It is not like that.	Ọ dịghị ka nke ahụ.
But now is not the time to back down.	Ma ugbu a abụghị oge ịla azụ.
No one came.	Ọ dịghị onye ọ bụla bịara ebe ahụ.
That will always be true.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ eziokwu mgbe niile.
But now we are.	Ma ugbu a, anyị bụ.
This car is really fast.	Ụgbọ ala a na-agba ọsọ n'ezie.
It is a difficult and arduous task.	Bụ ọrụ siri ike na nke siri ike.
It should be.	Kwesịrị ka ọ dị.
He looked at it carefully.	O lere ya anya nke ọma.
In a positive way.	N'ụzọ dị mma.
Sister or father.	Nwanne ma ọ bụ nna.
They fled.	Ha gbara ọsọ.
Still, yours is a special case.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, nke gị bụ ikpe pụrụ iche.
Worth noting.	Kwesịrị ịma.
But he is afraid.	Ma ọ na-atụ egwu.
You did only what you knew you would do.	I mere naanị ihe ị maara na ị ga-eme.
He said so well.	O kwuru nke ọma.
He is still alone.	Ọ ka nọ naanị ya.
Unfortunately, there is a problem.	O di nwute, enwere nsogbu.
We think these two strategies do not work well.	Anyị na-eche na atụmatụ abụọ a adịghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Should get out.	Kwesịrị ịpụ.
But he did not know any of them.	Ma ọ maghị nke ọ bụla.
About your eyes.	Ihe gbasara anya gị na .
The knife went out of his hand.	Mma ahụ si n’aka ya pụọ.
Too much water is not good for the skin.	Oke mmiri adịghị mma maka akpụkpọ ahụ.
He did it.	O mere ya.
He did well.	O mere nke ọma.
All he can do.	Ihe niile o nwere ike ime.
Many places require strong lighting.	Ọtụtụ ebe chọrọ ọkụ ọkụ dị ike.
There is something different about his face.	Ọ dị ihe dị iche na ihu ya.
I have a mind.	Enwere m uche.
All the students seemed to get to know each other.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ahụ niile yiri ka ha maara ibe ha.
It really happened.	O mere n'ezie.
All existing towers are like this.	Ụlọ elu niile dị ugbu a dị ka nke a.
Enjoy driving, if you can.	Nwee obi ụtọ ịnya ụgbọ ahụ, ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike.
House members.	Ndị otu ụlọ.
Someone important.	Onye dị mkpa.
The difference is true in this case.	Ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu na nke a.
A dramatic film met him.	Ihe nkiri dị egwu zutere ya.
How is her body?	Kedu ka ahụ ya dị.
It’s not about what the big dog is.	Ọ bụghị banyere ihe nnukwu nkịta ọ bụ.
So simple it needs.	Ya mere ọ dị mfe mkpa ya.
I ran after that day.	M na-agba ọsọ n'azụ ụbọchị ahụ.
I liked the boy's spirit.	Mmụọ nwa nwoke ahụ masịrị m.
Work is.	Ọrụ bụ.
We are not united.	Anyị adịghị n'otu.
Obviously this does not happen.	O doro anya na nke a anaghị eme.
He hates the cold.	Ọ kpọrọ oyi asị.
I'm sure someone can find them.	Eji m n'aka na mmadụ nwere ike ịchọta ha.
No previous friends.	Enweghị ndị enyi gara aga.
I can’t feel that way again, man.	Enweghị m ike inwe mmetụta dị otú ahụ ọzọ, nwoke.
They tried twice.	Ha gbalịrị ugboro abụọ.
He likes to travel.	Ọ na-enwe mmasị ịga njem.
He got angry quickly.	Iwe were ya ngwa ngwa.
Probably a factor as to why he was so far away.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ya mere o ji nọrọ ebe dị anya.
This is my situation.	Nke a bụ ọnọdụ m.
They are in a bad way here.	Ha nọ n'ụzọ ọjọọ ebe a.
But wait.	Ma chere ya.
If the travel speed is the same.	Ọ bụrụ na ọsọ njem bụ otu.
The book achieved little success.	Akwụkwọ ahụ nwetara obere ihe ịga nke ọma.
It should not be like this.	O kwesịghị ịdị ka nke a.
There is a big prison.	E nwere nnukwu ọnụ ụlọ mkpọrọ.
He knows about it.	Ọ maara banyere ya.
It looks like.	Ọ dị ka ya.
This is the last thing you want.	Nke a bụ ihe ikpeazụ ị chọrọ.
It just makes sense.	Ọ na-eme nnọọ enweghị uche.
It's not very good.	Ọ dịghị mma nke ukwuu.
There will be no more.	Agaghị enwe ọzọ.
I do not care.	Achọghị m ịma.
Three died immediately.	Atọ nwụrụ ozugbo.
We like it.	Ọ masịrị anyị.
She heard him start to cry.	Ọ nụrụ ka ọ malitere ibe ákwá.
And drugs.	Na ọgwụ ọjọọ.
Then his right leg felt.	Mgbe ahụ, ụkwụ aka nri ya nwere mmetụta.
Once this is life.	Ozugbo nke a bụ ndụ.
Hard, hard but still young.	O siri ike, o siri ike mana ọ ka bụ nwata.
Because mine is mine.	Maka m bụ nke m.
It made little sense.	O mere obere mmetụta.
However, this is not the first time.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị nke mbụ.
I did not understand myself or my life.	Aghọtaghị m onwe m ma ọ bụ ndụ m.
They do their job and do it well.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ ha ma na-eme ya nke ọma.
I do it well.	Ana m eme ya nke ọma.
One who does not.	Onye na-adịghị.
There are only thirty.	Ọ bụ naanị otu iri atọ.
Maybe this is not for me.	Ma eleghị anya, nke a abụghị maka m.
That could not be wrong.	Nke ahụ apụghị ịbụ ihe ọjọọ.
He has a son and his wife.	O nwere otu nwa nwoke na nwunye ya.
I have a feeling for this movie.	Enwere m mmetụta maka ihe nkiri a.
This is not a matter of opinion.	Nke a abụghị ihe gbasara echiche.
Most likely it is necessary.	O yikarịrị ka ọ dị mkpa.
Stay as long as you want.	Nọrọ ruo ogologo oge ịchọrọ.
First time on the market.	Oge mbụ na ahịa.
There is no doubt about it.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na nke a.
But only that.	Ma ọ bụ naanị nke ahụ.
He finally got help.	O mechara nweta enyemaka.
Just not today.	Naanị ọ bụghị taa.
They eventually stopped.	Ha mechara kwụsị.
But there are two reasons why it is not here.	Ma e nwere ihe abụọ mere na ọ bụghị ebe a.
Yours is better.	Nke gị ka nke ọma.
We challenge everything.	Anyị na-ama ihe niile aka.
This was done for two reasons.	E mere nke a n'ihi ihe abụọ.
The dress is very nice, but very expensive.	Uwe ahụ dị mma nke ukwuu, mana ọ dị oke ọnụ.
The problem is finding them.	Nsogbu bụ ịchọta ha.
He saw them.	Ọ hụrụ ha.
Nothing small.	Ọ dịghị obere ihe.
But he could not do it.	Ma o nweghị ike ime ya.
What is your name?	Kedu aha gị?
Her grandmother was a prominent figure in the community.	Nne nne ya bụ onye ama ama na obodo ahụ.
Winter can be a difficult time.	Oge oyi nwere ike ịbụ oge siri ike.
There is never a single face.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bụla otu ihu.
People began to love him.	Ndị mmadụ malitere ịhụ ya n'anya.
I left him his way.	M hapụrụ ya ụzọ ya.
I like to be alone.	Ọ na-amasị m ịnọ naanị m.
Very recently stated that the service is very.	Dị nnọọ nso nso kwuru na ọrụ bụ nke ukwuu.
Lots to do in one day.	Ọtụtụ ihe ime n'otu ụbọchị.
The game has a lot of potential.	Egwuregwu ahụ nwere ọtụtụ ikike.
He ate alone.	O riri naanị ya.
But at the time, it was a good idea.	Ma n'oge ahụ, ọ bụ ezigbo echiche.
He put his hand inside her.	O tinyere aka ya n’ime ya.
I am scared.	Ụjọ na-atụ m.
Last year that was not true.	Afọ gara aga nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
The meal went well.	Nri ahụ gara nke ọma.
I am a cold girl.	Abụ m nwata nwanyị oyi.
The room is not hot.	Ime ụlọ adịghị ọkụ.
I know my wife.	Amaara m nwunye m.
I am very happy.	Enwere m obi ụtọ nke ukwuu.
It keeps its readers engaged.	Ọ na-eme ka ndị na-agụ ya na-arụ ọrụ.
Her clothes are beautiful.	Uwe ya mara mma.
There are many, many more in the consumer market.	Enwere ọtụtụ, ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ dị na ahịa eji eme ihe.
They entered a restaurant with no meaning.	Ha banyere n'otu ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ na-enweghị isi.
It has weight.	O nwere ibu.
It's a really interesting little story.	Ọ bụ obere akụkọ na-atọ ụtọ n'ezie.
It's my fault.	Ọ bụ m kpatara.
And before that, again.	Na tupu nke ahụ, ọzọ.
I try to help.	M na-agbalị inyere aka.
It looks like you.	Ọ dị ka gị.
I wish he wasn't like his father.	A sị m na ọ naghị adị ka nna ya.
No money required.	Enweghị ego achọrọ.
Ways to get what you want.	Ụzọ iji nweta ihe ị chọrọ.
He is doing well.	Ọ na-eme nke ọma.
I can't eat.	Enweghị m ike iri nri.
I saw this for help.	Ahụrụ m nke a maka enyemaka.
Most men should have jobs.	Ọtụtụ ụmụ nwoke kwesịrị inwe ọrụ.
This length does not matter.	Ogologo oge a adịghị mkpa.
It is in his hands.	Ọ bụ n'aka ya.
Nothing about this makes sense.	Ọ nweghị ihe gbasara nke a nwere ezi uche.
he asked.	ọ jụrụ.
Riding an hour is a common practice.	Ịnya otu awa bụ ihe ọtụtụ mmadụ na-eme.
Each of those factors is important.	Nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị ahụ dị mkpa.
i love it so much	ahụrụ m ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
But proceed to the next case, which works well.	Ma gaa n'ihu na ikpe ọzọ, nke na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Of course not.	N'ezie ọ nweghị ike.
Which is a nice little idea.	Nke bụ obere echiche dị mma.
That's fine.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị mma.
You go to school and do things on your own.	Ị na-aga ụlọ akwụkwọ mee ihe n'onwe gị.
He asked the accused to give his name and date of birth.	Ọ gwara onye a gbara akwụkwọ ka o nye aha ya na ụbọchị ọmụmụ ya.
Not everyone’s word for everyone.	Ọ bụghị okwu onye ọ bụla nye onye ọ bụla.
I don’t want anyone to see this.	Achọghị m ka onye ọ bụla hụ nke a.
But it's a very different man.	Ma ọ bụ nnọọ dị iche iche nwoke.
Two children in two homes.	Ụmụaka abụọ nọ n'ụlọ abụọ.
I want to face this as a man.	Achọrọ m ihu nke a dị ka nwoke.
He got angry when he said the last word.	Iwe were ya mgbe o kwuru okwu ikpeazụ.
It’s good for a little something for my life.	Ọ dị mma maka ntakịrị ihe maka ndụ m.
Beautiful food.	Nri mara mma.
The news was amazing.	Akụkọ ahụ tụrụ n'anya.
I can't take it seriously.	Enweghị m ike iji ya kpọrọ ihe.
He wanted what he wanted.	Ọ chọrọ ihe ọ chọrọ.
Two city stories	Akụkọ obodo abụọ
As will be necessary.	Dị ka ọ ga-adị mkpa.
And someone else.	Na onye ọzọ.
A deed to them.	A omume ha.
His actions and words are different and new.	Omume ya na okwu ya dị iche iche na ihe ọhụrụ.
Just go ahead until you finish it.	Naanị gaa n'ihu ruo mgbe ị mechara ya.
You just know that you give more than anyone else.	Ị mara nnọọ na i nyere karịa onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
Today is even better.	Taa ka mma karịa.
Now, the difference is real.	Ugbu a, ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu.
I know him if you know him.	Ama m ya ma ị mara ya.
Anger can be good.	Iwe nwere ike ịdị mma.
It makes it seem like nothing happened here.	Ọ na-eme ka ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ihe mere ebe a.
Let us know what you think.	Mee ka anyị mara ihe unu niile chere.
I had time to get to know the village better.	Enwere m oge iji mara obodo nta ahụ nke ọma.
I am looking for a girl.	Ana m achọ nwa agbọghọ.
Things are going well.	Ihe na-aga nke ọma.
I hope you enjoyed them !.	Enwere m olileanya na ị masịrị ha!.
He invested all his money in this project.	O tinyere ego niile o nwetara n'ọrụ a.
It's like another city.	Ọ dị ka obodo ọzọ.
One symbolic situation is this.	Otu ọnọdụ ihe atụ bụ nke a.
You are what you eat.	Ị bụ ihe ị na-eri.
Give me a minute.	Nye m nkeji.
That is.	Nke ọ bụ.
But it is good.	Ma, ọ dị mma.
Waiting for you.	Na-eche gị.
No minimum car value required.	Enweghị uru ụgbọ ala kacha nta achọrọ.
I don’t want to know what they did before that.	Achọghị m ịma ihe ha mere tupu nke ahụ.
The study will take place in three minutes.	Ọmụmụ ihe ga-eme na nkeji atọ.
The store staff was cruel.	Ndị ọrụ ụlọ ahịa ahụ nwere obi ọjọọ.
This is where we live.	Nke a bụ ebe anyị bi.
My first application.	Ngwa ngwa mbụ m.
You know that you can say anything to your mother and me.	Ị ma na ị nwere ike ịgwa mụ na nne gị ihe ọ bụla.
You have a real life ahead of you.	Ị nwere ezigbo ndụ n'ihu gị.
What amazes me is how.	Ihe na-atụ m n'anya bụ otú.
He left her.	Ọ hapụrụ ya.
They have two daughters and one son.	Ha nwere ụmụ nwanyị abụọ na otu nwa nwoke.
As soon as we can go.	Ozugbo anyị nwere ike ịga.
To his surprise, he never talked about food.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya na ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-ekwu banyere nri.
I don't think anything else.	Echeghị m ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
You can play all of this.	Ị nwere ike iji ihe a niile egwu egwu.
No such effect is seen here.	Enweghị mmetụta dị otú ahụ a hụrụ ebe a.
We have nothing.	Anyị enweghị ihe ọ bụla.
This is not for my company or for me.	Nke a abụghị maka ụlọ ọrụ m ma ọ bụ maka m.
It won't be good, but then nothing will happen.	Ọ gaghị adị mma, mana mgbe ahụ, ọ nweghị ihe ga-eme.
He wants me to sit down.	Ọ chọrọ ka m nọdụ ala.
This money came the other day.	Ego a bịara ụbọchị gara aga.
I was the last person in the hall.	Abụ m onye ikpeazụ n'ụlọ nzukọ ahụ.
He clearly hated this man.	O doro anya na ọ kpọrọ nwoke a asị.
The room now has a church.	Ime ụlọ ugbu a nwere ụlọ ụka.
My mother was perfect again.	Nne m zuru oke ọzọ.
Why we are not there.	Ihe mere na anyị anọghị ebe ahụ.

But could not help it.	Ma enweghị ike inyere ya aka.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị njọ na mfe.

He wants to make his life with you.	Ọ chọrọ ime ka ndụ ya na gị.
Of course, we are from old school.	N'ezie, anyị si n'ụlọ akwụkwọ ochie.
He suggests something.	Ọ na-atụ aro ihe.

It can have an effect.	O nwere ike inwe mmetụta.
The first of these powers is the state of being.	Nke mbụ n'ime ikike ndị a bụ ọnọdụ ọnọdụ.

I finally found out the color scheme.	M mechara mara atụmatụ agba ahụ.
His mother lives with him.	Nne ya na ya bi.
Then he saw my mother.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ hụrụ nne m.
So we went out and did the movie.	Anyị wee pụọ mee ihe nkiri ahụ.

Then he left the building.	Mgbe ahụ ọ hapụrụ ụlọ ahụ.
Tears in my heart.	Anya mmiri n'obi m.
I think the crew would never know.	Echere m na ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ agaghị ama.
The suffering makes life better.	Ahụhụ ahụ na-eme ka ndụ dị mma.

It's tough.	O siri ike.
I didn’t know you would have one.	Amaghị m na ị ga-enwe otu.
He didn’t know the difference, but he was still scared.	Ọ maghị ihe dị iche, mana ọ ka na-atụ egwu.
They know that they are dead in some way.	Ha maara na ha bụ ndị nwụrụ anwụ n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
So he continues to eat.	Ya mere ọ na-aga n'ihu na-eri nri.
However, it is worth it.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bara uru.
They have no money.	Ha enweghị ego.
He said you are so beautiful.	O kwuru na ị mara oke mma.
But no other words were uttered.	Ma ọ dịghị okwu ọzọ e kwuru.

Of course, he is thoughtful and powerful.	N'ezie, ọ na-eche echiche ma dị ike.

He says no one loves him.	Ọ na-ekwu na ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya n'anya.

And life is loved.	Na ndụ hụrụ n'anya.

However, they run very fast.	Otú ọ dị, ha na-agba ọsọ nke ukwuu.
If you have children, play with them.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ụmụaka, mee egwuregwu na ya.
I don't have a big game.	Enweghị m nnukwu egwuregwu.
Sometimes it can help, but sometimes it can’t.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ọ nwere ike inye aka, ma mgbe ụfọdụ ọ naghị enwe ike.

His wife loves life.	Nwunye ya hụrụ ndụ n'anya.

A group of people looked at them carefully.	Otu ndị mmadụ lere ha anya nke ọma.

Anything works for you personally to get the job done.	Ihe ọ bụla na-arụ ọrụ maka gị onwe gị iji nweta ọrụ ahụ.
We play alone.	Anyị na-egwu naanị.

I would like another plane, a faster flight.	Aga m achọ ụgbọ elu ọzọ, ụgbọ elu ngwa ngwa.
This is his life.	Nke a bụ ndụ ya.
We need to do well.	Anyị kwesịrị ime nke ọma.
He is a person.	Ọ bụ onye.
He did not know his own strength.	Ọ maghị ike nke ya.
I'm sure that will be fine.	Eji m n'aka na nke ahụ ga-adị mma.
I like going there.	Ọ masịrị m ịga ebe ahụ.
The newspaper reporter said the man was in hospital.	Onye nta akụkọ akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ kwuru na nwoke ahụ nọ n'ụlọ ọgwụ.
The incident took place in a nearby town yesterday.	Ihe a mere n'ime obodo dị nso ebe a ụnyahụ.
So it is you.	Ya mere ọ bụ gị.
There are players from different parts of the country.	Enwere ndị egwuregwu si n'akụkụ dị iche iche nke mba ahụ.
I knew from the first minute it was like me.	Amaara m site na nkeji mbụ ka ọ dị ka m.
The games should be hand-in-hand.	Ekwesịrị ime egwuregwu ndị ahụ dị n'aka ọnụ.
It is good now.	Ọ dị mma ugbu a.
He wondered how many times he would say that.	Ọ nọ na-eche ugboro ole o kwuru ihe ahụ.
He looked at me intently.	O lere m anya nke ọma.
It happens to me.	Ọ na-eme na nke m.
The city is famous for its pleasant atmosphere.	Obodo a ma ama maka ọnọdụ obi ụtọ ya.
If that works for some people, that’s fine.	Ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ na-arụ ọrụ maka ụfọdụ ndị, nke ahụ dị mma.
The type or location of the object does not matter.	Ụdị ihe ma ọ bụ ebe ihe dị na ya adịghị mkpa.
I walked away from him.	M si n'ebe ọ nọ pụọ.
Maybe someone else can.	Ma eleghị anya, onye ọzọ nwere ike.
It would have gone.	Ọ gaara aga.
They are worse than we are at their age.	Ha dị njọ karịa ka anyị dị n'afọ ndụ ha.
The benefits should be minimal.	Uru kwesịrị ịdị ntakịrị.
It was perfect for the situation.	O zuru oke maka ọnọdụ ahụ.
The woman is a doctor.	Nwanyị ahụ bụ dọkịta.
That is the information he can use.	Nke ahụ bụ ozi ọ nwere ike iji.
But it didn't matter.	Ma o nweghị ihe o mere.
I'm sure.	Eji m n'aka.
It is a good book.	Ọ bụ ezigbo akwụkwọ.
Wait for the other person to make the first trip.	Chere ka onye nke ọzọ mee njem mbụ.
The players are still ready to go.	Ndị egwuregwu ahụ ka dị njikere ịga.
We watched a movie.	Anyị lere ihe nkiri.
This minute.	Nke a nkeji.
But then they are.	Ma mgbe ahụ, ha bụ.
And everyone.	Na onye ọ bụla.
We got this.	Anyị nwetara nke a.
It was a tough game.	Ọ bụ egwuregwu siri ike.
They need to think again.	Ha kwesịrị iche echiche ọzọ.
No point yet.	Enweghị isi ihe ka dị.
They are not like.	Ha adịghị ka.
This is one of my examples.	Nke a bụ otu n'ime ihe atụ m.
So smart.	Ya mere mara ihe.
He always challenged himself.	Ọ na-ama onwe ya aka mgbe niile.
He wants us to have a new one.	Ọ chọrọ ka anyị nwee otu ọhụrụ.
For two reasons, you know, what happened.	N'ihi ihe abụọ, ị maara, ihe merenụ.
Everything is awesome.	Ihe niile dị oke egwu.
But so far, everything seems beautiful.	Ma, ka ọ dị ugbu a, ihe niile yiri ka ọ mara mma.
This is yours for me, myself.	Nke a bụ gị nye m, mụ onwe ya.
It goes on and on.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu.
I hope this is fun.	Enwere m olileanya na nke a na-atọ ụtọ.
I was surprised.	O juru m anya.
They were successful.	Ha nwere ihe ịga nke ọma.
He did not want to give any of this away.	Ọ chọghị inye ihe ọ bụla nke a pụọ.
You know everything, but you don't know anything.	Ị maara ihe niile, mana ị maghị ihe ọ bụla.
Pretty girl.	Nwa agbọghọ mara mma.
At this hour he cannot eat.	N'oge awa a ọ nweghị ike iri nri.
I know it's just a matter of time.	Ama m na ọ bụ naanị oge.
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ọ na-arụ ọrụ ma mgbe ụfọdụ ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
But nothing is easy here.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe dị mfe ebe a.
You are over your head here.	Ị nọ n'ụzọ karịrị isi gị ebe a.
I can not give you anything.	Enweghị m ike inye gị ihe ọ bụla.
His house is waiting for him, his friends.	Ụlọ ya na-atụ ya, ndị enyi ya.
I know his mother.	Ama m nne ya.
I like the police.	Ndị uwe ojii na-amasị m.
You see something suddenly.	Ị hụrụ ihe na mberede.
Get the sense of humor that we are in for something.	Nweta mmetụta na-atọ ọchị na anyị nọ maka ihe.
He had a good day and had his bad guys.	O nwere ezigbo ụbọchị ma nwee ndị ọjọọ ya.
But there is money for this machine.	Mana enwere ego maka igwe a.

I am satisfied with this job!	Ọrụ a juru m afọ!
He did not know it was him.	Ọ maghị na ọ bụ ya.
Some are good and some are bad.	Ụfọdụ ndị dị mma na ụfọdụ ọjọọ.
But it does surprise him.	Ma ọ na-eme ka ọ tụrụ ya n’anya.
The journey reached its climax.	Njem ahụ rutere n'isi.
But this came now.	Ma nke a bịara ugbu a.
You need to have another holiday.	Ekwesịrị ị nweta ụbọchị ezumike ọzọ.
Not everyone can do what you do.	Ọ bụghị mmadụ niile nwere ike ime ihe ị na-eme.
These are not new ways.	Ndị a abụghị ụzọ ọhụrụ.
It will be high for a long time.	Ọ ga-adị elu ogologo oge.
It works well, for a short time away.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma, maka obere oge pụọ.
City life has many advantages.	Ndụ obodo nwere ọtụtụ ihe dị mma.
It’s a joke, nothing more.	Ọ bụ ihe egwuregwu, ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ.
Everything ate a little hot.	Ihe niile riri obere ọkụ.
His family liked him.	Ndị ezinụlọ ya masịrị ya.
Now the question is, what?	Ugbu a ajụjụ bụ, kedu?
I am very happy.	Obi dị m ụtọ nke ukwuu.
Search for specific effects.	Chọọ maka mmetụta ụfọdụ.
Do something different.	Mee ihe dị iche.
It will be a new food tour.	Ọ ga-abụ njem nri nri ọhụrụ.
Those are fun things to play.	Ndị ahụ bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ igwu egwu.
He put his hand next to hers.	O tinyere aka ya n’akụkụ ya.
You can do anything else with it, and not love it.	Ị nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla ọzọ na ya, ma ghara ịhụ ya n'anya.
Everything is really, really, very possible.	Ihe niile bụ n'ezie, n'ezie, dị nnọọ ekwe omume.
I’ve known him since he was a kid.	Amaara m ya kemgbe ọ dị elu.
The first game is a tough fight.	Egwuregwu mbụ bụ ọgụ siri ike.
This is their last chance.	Nke a bụ ohere ikpeazụ ha.
Well, you met him.	Ọ dị mma, ị zutere ya.
They want to eat you alive.	Ha chọrọ iri gị ndụ.
In extreme times, people do amazing things.	N'oge dị egwu, ndị mmadụ na-eme ihe dị egwu.
I just know it.	M nnọọ maara ya.
Your mother is beautiful.	Nne gị mara mma.
Stop for a moment.	Kwụsị obere oge.
I'm glad you stopped.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ị kwụsịrị.
Thanks for finding it.	Daalụ maka ịchọta ya.
That would make him president twice.	Nke a ga-eme ya onye isi ala ugboro abụọ.
He said the car was not there at first.	O kwuru na ụgbọ ala ahụ anọghị ebe ahụ mbụ.
I never knew.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m maara.
Often, the cause is unknown.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, a maghị ihe kpatara ya.
It's not strong.	Ọ dịghị ike.
They were not like anything he expected.	Ha adịghị ka ihe ọ bụla ọ tụrụ anya ya.
Many of them, many, many.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha, ọtụtụ, ọtụtụ.
The weather ahead is clear.	Ihu igwe dị n'ihu doro anya.
You seem to be doing well.	Ọ dị ka ị na-eme nke ọma.
Our actions have an impact.	Omume anyị nwere mmetụta.
His job is his life.	Ọrụ ya bụ ndụ ya.
He never loved you.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ hụrụ gị n'anya.
You can of course position before it.	Ị nwere ike n'ezie ọnọdụ n'ihu ya.
Convenient location, bedding and shopping nearby.	Ebe dị mma, akwa akwa na ụlọ ahịa dị nso.
We look forward to seeing you there.	Anyị na-atụ anya ịhụ gị ebe ahụ.
By the way, that's enough.	N'agbanyeghị, nke ahụ zuru.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla kwesịrị ya.
With information about the girl, we don't want her anymore.	Site na ozi gbasara nwa agbọghọ ahụ, anyị achọghị ya ọzọ.
Some things are important.	Ihe ụfọdụ dị mkpa.
They are the only two now.	Ọ bụ naanị ha abụọ ugbu a.
Many cities have nightlife.	Ọtụtụ obodo nwere ndụ abalị.
But there is more that works.	Ma e nwere ihe ndị ọzọ na-arụ ọrụ.
I need clothes.	Achọrọ m uwe.
Today, my mother-in-law.	Taa, nne di m.
And some of them are gay men.	Na ụfọdụ n’ime ha bụ ụmụ nwoke na-amasị nwoke.
All ideas are negative.	Echiche niile adịghị mma.
He obviously has something.	O doro anya na ọ nwere ihe.
We want him to be happy.	Anyị chọrọ ka obi dị ya ụtọ.
That’s how companies work.	Otú ahụ ka ụlọ ọrụ si arụ ọrụ.
I want to see it at work.	Achọrọ m ịhụ ya n'ọrụ.
I said no.	M kwuru mba.
The reality is different.	Eziokwu ahụ dị iche.
I think you are looking for a way.	Echere m na ị na-achọ ụzọ.
Not you.	Ọ bụghị gị.
He died at night.	Ọ nwụrụ n'abalị.
Now happy as a long day.	Ugbu a obi ụtọ dị ka ụbọchị dị ogologo.
The legs are.	Ụkwụ bụ.
My son is still young.	Nwa m nwoke ka dị obere.
Their health deteriorated rapidly.	Ahụ ike ha dara ngwa ngwa.
For that, you have to help.	Maka ya, ị ga-enyere aka.
On the other hand, he wanted his work to be important.	N'aka nke ọzọ, ọ chọrọ ka ọrụ ya dị mkpa.
They thought.	Ha chere.
I'm scared.	Ọ dị m egwu.
So one way is not the same as the other.	Ya mere, otu ụzọ adịghị ka nke ọzọ.
Tell me something new.	Gwa m ihe ọhụrụ.
Do it on the other side.	Mee n'akụkụ nke ọzọ.
The only color he saw was green.	Naanị agba ọ hụrụ bụ akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ.
After all.	Mgbe niile.
He spoke well.	O kwuru okwu ọma.
It only makes sense to do so in one case.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe ezi uche dị na ya ime nke a n'otu ikpe.
But he never told you the truth.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe ọ gwara gị eziokwu.
We both enjoyed the trip.	Anyị abụọ nwere mmasị na njem ahụ.
Worked one time ago.	Na-arụ ọrụ otu oge gara aga.
Now, it is clear.	Ugbu a, o doro ya anya.
As of today.	Dị ka taa.
You're good.	Ị dị mma.
Like a puppy.	Dị ka nwa nkịta.
He will not do it.	Ọ gaghị eme ya.
The weather is hot.	Ihu igwe dị ọkụ.
It has many unique features.	Ọ nwere ọtụtụ atụmatụ pụrụ iche.
It must have been my daughter and I.	Ọ ga-abụ mụ na nwa m nwanyị.
It is nighttime.	Ọ bụ abalị.
But my promise is still there.	Ma nkwa m ka dị.
Others than you enjoy the family.	Ndị ọzọ karịa gị na-enwe mmasị na ezinụlọ ahụ.
Whatever happened, they knew.	Ihe ọ bụla merenụ, ha maara.
My son told me once.	Nwa m nwoke gwara m otu oge.
It is a thing of the past.	Ọ bụ ihe gara aga.
Other cars were successful.	Ụgbọ ala ndị ọzọ na-aga nke ọma.
Her house is green.	Ụlọ ya gbara akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ.
The movie surprised everyone.	Ihe nkiri ahụ tụrụ mmadụ niile n’anya.
I have a good job.	Enwere m ezigbo ọrụ.
Ten years ago, that was easy to do.	Afọ iri gara aga, ọ dị mfe ime nke ahụ.
There are about three police boats.	Enwere ihe dị ka ụgbọ mmiri ndị uwe ojii atọ.
Some words can only be and for me, those are.	Ụfọdụ okwu nwere naanị ike na maka m, ndị ahụ nwere.
Everything is new and beautiful.	Ihe niile dị ọhụrụ na ọnọdụ mara mma.
That is why we are here.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị ji nọrọ ebe a.
It was delicious then.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ mgbe ahụ.
There is a time value for money.	Enwere uru oge maka ego.
He said he was a father himself.	O kwuru na ya bụ nna n'onwe ya.
You can take it as much as possible.	Ị nwere ike were ya dị ka o kwere mee.
It still happened.	Ọ ka mere.
However, it is not.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị ya.
What kind of food, how much food.	Kedu ụdị nri, ole nri.
Of course, I can’t get too much.	N'ezie, enweghị m ike ị nweta oke.
It is not new.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọhụrụ.
Not a bad morning job.	Ọ bụghị ọrụ ụtụtụ ọjọọ.
That, and stay short.	Nke ahụ, ma nọrọ obere.
Everything else is simple.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ dị mfe.
We hope you like working with us !.	Anyị na-atụ gị na-amasị gị na-arụ ọrụ na anyị!.
She looked at him, as if she were about to say something.	O lere ya anya, ọ dị ka ọ na-achọ ikwu ihe.
Everything was fine for about an hour.	Ihe niile dị mma maka ihe dị ka otu awa.
The idea is negative.	Echiche ahụ adịghị mma.
For a while.	Maka obere oge.
However, there is a difference.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ihe dị iche na nke a.
First there is a clear path.	Mbụ e nwere ụzọ doro anya.
He pointed to another worker.	Ọ tụrụ onye ọrụ ọzọ aka.
You are not a woman.	Ị bụghị nwanyị.
Or at least that’s what everyone thinks.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, nke ahụ bụ ihe onye ọ bụla chere.
It was a day or two.	Ọ bụ otu ụbọchị ma ọ bụ abụọ.
Stop whatever you are doing.	Kwụsị ihe ọ bụla ị na-eme.
Other students did not see it as well.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ndị ọzọ ahụghị ya nke ukwuu.
However, more than that, it will be necessary to find more.	Otú ọ dị, karịa nke ahụ, ọ ga-adị mkpa ịchọta ihe ndị ọzọ.
We are friends, which is nice.	Anyị bụ enyi, nke dị mma.
Go right away.	Gaa ozugbo ịga.
Regarding the latter, there seems to be two possibilities.	Banyere nke ikpeazụ, ọ dị ka enwere ike abụọ.
We don't work.	Anyị anaghị arụ ọrụ.
No one was scared or frightened.	Ọ dịghị onye na-atụ egwu ma ọ bụ na-atụ egwu.
Only one daughter, the girl he lives with.	Naanị otu nwa nwanyị, nwa agbọghọ ya na nwanyị ahụ bi.
He wants to go to school.	Ọ chọrọ ịga akwụkwọ.
Good way.	Ụzọ dị mma.
He made his own.	O mere nke ya.
Or ‘only’.	Ma ọ bụ 'naanị'.
The hot year is a minute away.	Afọ ọkụ bụ nkeji anya.
My mother told me about it.	Nne m gwara m banyere ya.
I can't do them.	Enweghị m ike ime ha.
This is where many heads of state fall.	Nke a bụ ebe ọtụtụ ndị isi ndị isi dara.
Better along the way.	Mma n'ụzọ.
Whether you like it or not.	Ọ masịrị gị ma ọ bụ na ị chọghị.
It's better that it is.	Ọ ka mma na ọ dị.
He thought he could help.	O chere na ya nwere ike inye aka.
There is no doubt in my mind about it.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya n'obi m banyere ya.
Each one has its time.	Nke ọ bụla nwere oge.
Go get one.	Gaa nweta otu.
Everyone has these things.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ihe ndị a.
He died in his cell last night.	Ọ nwụrụ n'ọnụ ụlọ mkpọrọ ya n'abalị ụnyahụ.
Thinking got me right.	Iche echiche nwetara m nke ọma.
For many reasons, of course.	Maka ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya, n'ezie.
What happens next is that they shot you.	Ihe na-eme ọzọ bụ na ha gbara gị.
If the object works for a long time.	Ọ bụrụ na ihe ahụ na-arụ ọrụ ogologo oge.
Because it looks like.	N'ihi na ọ mara mma dị ka.
He told her very well about the project.	Ọ gwara ya nke ọma banyere ọrụ ahụ.
Can't imagine what will happen at this time.	Enweghị ike iche ihe ga-eme n'oge a.
Soon, they will be here with food.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, ha ga-eji nri nri bịa ebe a.
To have everything in my life.	Iji ihe niile nke ndụ m.
Someone has an idea as to why this is happening.	Ọ nwere onye nwere echiche ihe kpatara nke a ji eme.
You know how this can end.	Ị ma ka nke a ga-esi kwụsị.
But you know.	Ma, ị maara,.
Some patients seek the help of relatives.	Ụfọdụ ndị ọrịa chọrọ enyemaka nke ndị ikwu ha.
With his sister.	Ya na nwanne ya nwanyị.
Everyone is interested in them.	Onye ọ bụla nwere mmasị na ha.
We had a great time in this house.	Anyị nwere ezigbo oge n'ụlọ a.
I run for almost an hour off.	M na-agba ọsọ fọrọ nke nta ka otu awa anya.
And that’s the core of it.	Na nke ahụ bụ isi ya.
He is not like everyone else.	Ọ naghị adị ka ndị ọzọ.
It is not good at all.	Ọ dịghị mma ma ọlị.
Everything about them is true.	Ihe niile gbasara ha bụ eziokwu.
But personally.	Ma n'onwe m.
She is known for her beauty.	E ji mara ya mma maka ịma mma ya.
Or it will not happen.	Ma ọ bụ agaghị eme.
At first, he did not like it very much.	Na mbụ, ọ dịghị amasị ya nke ọma.
Any kind of thing.	Nke ọ bụla ụdị ihe ọ bụla.
So he told her, and she departed.	Ya mere, ọ gwara ya, o wee pụọ.
I do not know what to do.	Amaghị ihe ị ga-eme.
It is well-known about the man's name.	O nwere ihe a maara nke ọma banyere aha nwoke ahụ.
The truth of this is not the same.	Eziokwu dị na nke a abụghị otu.
He feels the same way about her.	Otú ahụ ka obi dị ya banyere ya.
I sat down next to him.	M nọdụ ala n'akụkụ ya.
If you like, we can do it here.	Ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị, anyị nwere ike ime ya ebe a.
Players are ready for that.	Ndị egwuregwu dị njikere maka nke ahụ.
More information is available.	Ozi ndị ọzọ dị.
I have one more challenge for you.	Enwere m otu ihe ịma aka ọzọ maka gị.
What he did would have a huge impact on everyone.	Ihe o mere ga-esi ike nke ukwuu n'ebe onye ọ bụla nọ.
It was a good trip.	Ọ bụ ezigbo njem.
They understood the way.	Ha ghọtara ụzọ ahụ.
There is nothing that I like to do in my life.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla na-amasị m otú ahụ ná ndụ m.
He was doing well at the time.	Ọ na-eme nke ọma n'oge ahụ.
It will be the first thing one sees when they enter here.	Ọ ga-abụ ihe mbụ mmadụ hụrụ mgbe ha banyere ebe a.
But it is easier said than done.	Ma ọ dị mfe ikwu karịa ime.
He will be here for two weeks.	Ọ ga-anọ ebe a izu abụọ.
This is especially true.	Nke a kacha bụrụ eziokwu.
But no, it is.	Ma mba, ọ dị.
Maybe he stopped them from seeing you.	Ma eleghị anya, o mere ka ha ghara ime ya ịhụ gị.
Indoors.	Ihe dị n'ime ụlọ.
They would not have sung.	Ha agaraghị abụ.
This in itself can be seen as a form of violence.	Enwere ike ịhụ nke a n'onwe ya dị ka ụdị ime ihe ike.
He thought he might be the one.	O chere na ya nwere ike ịbụ onye ahụ.
Many people feel the same way now.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ nwere otu mmetụta ahụ ugbu a.
It doesn’t seem to be out of his way or anything.	Ọ dịghị ka ọ si n'ụzọ ya ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
So he went.	Ya mere ọ gara.
They need cheap food.	Ha chọrọ nri dị ọnụ ala.
We are here as mothers and daughters.	Anyị nọ ebe a dị ka nne na nwa nwanyị.
They have the best of the best.	Ha nwere ihe kacha mma nke kacha mma.
Who started the company.	Onye malitere ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
He heard those words.	Ọ nụrụ okwu ndị ahụ.
They looked at each other.	Ha lere ibe ha anya.
How much money do you have for yourself?	Ego ole ka ị nwere maka gị?
We are here for the study.	Anyị nọ ebe a na ọmụmụ ihe.
He will not be there that day.	Ọ gaghị anọ ụbọchị ahụ n'onwe ya.
He never left work.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ hapụrụ ọrụ.
That was the only town we lived in.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị obodo anyị bi na ya.
You go tonight.	Ị na-aga n'abalị a.
There is a clear example of this.	Enwere ihe atụ doro anya nke a.
I hope you understand and know this.	Enwere m olileanya na ị ghọtara ma mara nke a.
The truth is clear.	Eziokwu doro anya.
It is something we should do.	Ọ bụ ihe anyị kwesịrị ịdị na-eme.
He is a fool.	Ọ bụ onye nzuzu.
Another who seems to be having the time of his life.	Onye ọzọ nke yiri ka ọ na-enwe oge nke ndụ ya.
For us, it was never wrong.	Maka anyị, ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ.
They did all the bad things they could.	Ha mere ihe ọjọọ niile ha nwere ike ime.
What? 	Kedu?
he said.	o kwuru.
For a while, nothing happened.	Ruo oge ụfọdụ, ọ dịghị ihe merenụ.
I used it to make pork.	Eji m ya mee anụ ezi.
There are many reasons why some games do not do this.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara egwuregwu ụfọdụ anaghị eme nke a.
Now, of course, we know very well.	Ugbu a, n'ezie, anyị maara nke ọma.
Maybe that makes sense to someone.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ nwere ezi uche nye mmadụ.
We did two really different things.	Anyị mere abụọ dị iche iche n'ezie.
But this can happen.	Ma nke a nwere ike ime.
They are good and fast.	Ha dị mma na ngwa ngwa.
As before.	Dị ka ọ dị na mbụ.
I hope for the best.	Enwere m olileanya maka ihe ọma.
They have different things.	Ha nwere ihe dị iche iche.
Or something else.	Ma ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
Personal.	Onye onwe.
What is the best way to get it.	Kedu omume kacha mma iji nweta ya.
Like the previous day.	Dị ka ụbọchị gara aga.
For me, this is the ultimate drug threat.	Maka m, nke a bụ egwu ọgwụ kacha.
They will be better than they are.	Ha ga-adị mma karịa ka ha dị.
They were immediately there.	Ha nọ ozugbo.
We are waiting to see some things.	Anyị na-eche ịhụ ụfọdụ ihe.
There is a problem with game thinking and games.	Enwere nsogbu echiche egwuregwu na egwuregwu.
You want them to feel good about themselves.	Ị chọrọ ka obi dị ha ụtọ maka onwe ha.
This is a big trip.	Nke a bụ nnukwu njem.
They will not make me go away.	Ha agaghị eme ka m pụọ.
Others spread it around.	Ndị ọzọ gbasara ya gburugburu.
You enjoy it.	Ọ na-atọ gị ụtọ.
No home.	Enweghị ụlọ.
There is no reason to doubt.	Ọ dịghị ihe mere a ga-eji nwee obi abụọ.
You are young, beautiful and popular.	Ị bụ nwata, mara mma ma bụrụ onye a ma ama.
Which is better, because they don't go anywhere.	Nke dị mma, n'ihi na ha anaghị aga ebe ọ bụla.
In the meantime, we can see what works and what doesn't.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, anyị nwere ike ịhụ ihe na-arụ ọrụ na ihe na-adịghị arụ ọrụ.
As you wish.	Dị ka ị chọrọ.
Not so.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ.

And clearly they are the work of the group.	Na n'ụzọ doro anya na ha bụ ọrụ nke otu ndị ahụ.
This is how it is done.	Otu a ka esi eme ya.
Good, but weak.	Ọ dị mma, mana adịghị ike.
Both are not good.	Ha abụọ adịghị mma.
This did not happen in his own time.	Nke a emeghị n'oge nke ya.
But he just called you.	Ma ọ dị nnọọ ka ọ kpọrọ gị.
But chance or not, it does not matter.	Ma, ohere ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị, ọ dịghị mkpa.
You will have a great day tomorrow.	Ị ga-enwe nnukwu ụbọchị echi.
Without water, life is impossible	Enweghị mmiri, ndụ agaghị ekwe omume
Take customer service, he continued.	Were ọrụ ndị ahịa, ọ gara n'ihu.
There is nothing to do about it.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla ime banyere ya.
But the truth is there.	Ma eziokwu dị n'ebe ahụ.
I have it.	Enwere m ya.
Of course the music is ‘now’.	N'ezie egwu bụ 'ugbu a'.
One month ago, better.	Otu ọnwa gara aga, ka mma.
In this case there are no letters.	Na nke a enweghị akwụkwọ ozi ndị ahụ.
We were there for a few hours.	Anyị nọrọ ebe ahụ awa ole na ole.
We will have a reason.	Anyị ga-enwe ihe kpatara ya.

That is good.	Nke ahụ dị mma.
Of course.	N'ezie.
Give yourself a break.	Nye onwe gị ezumike.
He is not a child.	Ọ bụghị nwata.
Simple, very sweet and inviting.	Dị mfe, dị nnọọ ụtọ na ọ kpọrọ.

Not too challenging though.	Ọ bụghị oke ihe ịma aka n'agbanyeghị.
I need to help with that.	Ekwesịrị m inye aka na nke ahụ.
And a lot of fun.	Na ọtụtụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
I think we are happy together.	Echere m na anyị nwere obi ụtọ ọnụ.
I did not know before.	Amaghị n'ihu ahụ.
People quickly filled him.	Ndị mmadụ juru ya ngwa ngwa.
Most people are not.	Ọtụtụ ndị bi na ya enweghị.
In others, no doubt.	Na ndị ọzọ, obi abụọ adịghị ya.
It sounds like fun.	Ọ dị ka ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
Definitely worth it.	N'ezie kwesịrị ya.
I do not want to be friends with you.	Achọghị m ka mụ na gị bụrụ enyi.
I heard it recently.	M nụrụ ya nso nso a.
Male and female students have good friends.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ nwoke na nwanyị nwere ezigbo enyi.
His own way.	Ụzọ nke ya.
But it happens to me.	Ma ọ na-eme m.
A little water in the winter.	Mmiri obere n'oge oyi.
We come to see it many places.	Anyị na-abịa ịhụ ya ọtụtụ ebe.
She has three children.	O nwere ụmụ atọ.
All of this is my land.	Ihe a niile bụ ala m.
Imagine that you are not.	Were ya na ị bụghị gị.
I’m sure every man does it.	Eji m n'aka na nwoke ọ bụla na-eme ya.
They want to play.	Ha chọrọ igwu egwu.
Makes no sense.	Na-eme ka enweghị uche.
I think it would make a good house.	Echere m na ọ ga-eme ezigbo ụlọ.
It's too scary.	Ọ dị oke egwu.
He loves his own son.	Ọ hụrụ nwa nke ya n'anya.
Not to mention.	Ghara ikwu.
The type of music is different.	Ụdị egwu dị iche.
We started at night.	Anyị malitere n'abalị.
But so.	Ma, ya mere.
It's too bad.	Ọ dị nnọọ njọ.
It is the headquarters of the synagogue.	Ọ bụ isi ụlọ nzukọ ahụ.
I think this fire is alive.	Echere m na ọkụ a dị ndụ.
Your wife, you love her.	Nwunye gị, ị hụrụ ya n'anya.
The real problem is the workers.	Ezigbo nsogbu bụ ndị ọrụ.
If you say so.	Ọ bụrụ na ị na-ekwu otú ahụ.
The people are bad.	Ihe ọjọọ ndị mmadụ mere ya.
Let's go for a walk together.	Ka anyị gaa njem ọnụ.
Because he knew the story or he didn't know it.	N'ihi na ọ maara akụkọ ahụ ma ọ bụ na ọ maghị.
He had problems with his father and brother.	Ya na nna ya na nwanne ya nwere nsogbu.
As you can see, there is something for everyone !.	Dị ka ị pụrụ ịhụ, e nwere ihe maka onye ọ bụla !.
He was clear.	O doro ya anya.
Whenever it started.	Mgbe ọ bụla ọ malitere.
I know when.	Amaara m oge ọ bụ.
Chances are, you know a few.	Ohere dị, ị maara ole na ole.
What makes them so.	Ihe na-eme ka ha si eme.
Each game is as important as any other.	Egwuregwu ọ bụla dị mkpa dị ka nke ọ bụla ọzọ.
That might give him some ideas.	Nke ahụ nwere ike inye ya ụfọdụ echiche.
It seems simple.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị mfe.
So there we left it.	Ya mere, ebe ahụ ka anyị hapụrụ ya.
They need to speak.	Ha kwesịrị ikwu okwu.
There is no point only.	Enweghị isi naanị.
However.	Otú ọ dị.
But that is now.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ugbu a.
The house has three floors.	Ụlọ ahụ nwere ala atọ.
Not without a man.	Ọ bụghị na-enweghị nwoke.
All of these are employee rights that they do not currently have.	Ihe ndị a niile bụ ikike ndị ọrụ nke ha na-enweghị ugbu a.
The city needs good transportation, he said.	Obodo a chọrọ njem njem nke ọma, ka o kwuru.
But fire is not necessary.	Ma ọ bụghị ọkụ dị mkpa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọjọọ na ya.
We were surprised.	O juru anyị anya.
I don’t want it to stop.	Achọghị m ka ọ kwụsị.
A new case has been received.	E nwetara ikpe ọhụrụ.
It is a new book with no tests.	Ọ bụ akwụkwọ ọhụrụ na enweghị ule.
For color palette.	Maka agba agba.
I need help.	Achọrọ m enyemaka.
About two days if you find that way.	Ihe dị ka ụbọchị abụọ ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọta ụzọ ahụ.
Life is life, food is just there.	Ndụ bụ ndụ, nri dị naanị ebe ahụ.
I can go either way.	Enwere m ike ịga n'ụzọ ọ bụla.
It is a very difficult task.	Ọ bụ ọrụ siri nnọọ ike.
He could not do this in any way.	Ọ nweghị ike ime nke a n'ụzọ ọ bụla.
She knew she was beautiful.	Ọ ma na ọ mara mma.
The woman you are talking about is not a coworker.	Nwanyị ahụ ị na-eche banyere ya abụghị onye ọrụ ibe.
I thought about that for a few days.	M chere banyere nke ahụ ụbọchị ole na ole.
It alone is more than that.	Naanị ya bụ ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
I know that bad things can happen to me because they have to.	Ama m na ihe ọjọọ nwere ike ime m n'ihi na ha nwere.
It's not fair.	Ọ dịghị mma.
The legs of this object are very long.	Ụkwụ nke ihe a dị nnọọ ogologo.
You will not have, again.	Ị gaghị enwe, ọzọ.
He had a sense of righteousness.	O nwere mmetụta nke ezi omume.
None of these things are new.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a bụ ihe ọhụrụ.
Still, he enjoyed it.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ masịrị ya.
There is no doubt about it.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na ihe ọ na-eche.
We are no different.	Anyị adịghị iche karịa ha.
The city needs good transportation, the president said.	Obodo a chọrọ njem njem nke ọma, onye isi ala kwuru.
It's stupid.	Ọ bụ nzuzu.
The truths we have.	Eziokwu ndị anyị nwere.
He wants to improve their lot in life.	Ọ na-achọ ime ka ọnọdụ ndụ ha ka mma.
We need to play well here.	Anyị kwesịrị igwu egwu nke ọma ebe a.
It was awesome in front of him.	Ọ dị oke egwu n'ihu ya.
He may know where this is going.	O nwere ike ịma ebe ihe a na-aga.
It was a good smile.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ọnụ ọchị.
I do not want to know your name.	Achọghị m ịma aha gị.
The story ends here.	Akụkọ a kwụsịrị n'ebe a.
They want their family and friends.	Ha chọrọ ezinụlọ ha na ndị enyi ha.
Going to the moon requires tremendous energy.	Ịga n'ọnwa chọrọ ike dị egwu.
Deep inside you realized it was time to leave.	N'ime ime gị ghọtara na ọ bụ oge ịpụ.
He started running.	Ọ malitere ịgba ọsọ.
I will see my son.	Aga m ahụ nwa m nwoke.
There could be a variety of reasons for this.	Enwere ike inwe ihe dị iche iche kpatara nke a.
It's not good.	Ọ naghị adị mma.
He called them friends.	Ọ kpọrọ ha ndị enyi.
Everything works well together.	Ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma ọnụ.
That is a beautiful thing.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe mara mma.
He quickly took the money.	O were ngwa ngwa were ego ahụ.
I knew he wanted me.	Ama m na ọ chọrọ m.
The fish are running.	Azụ na-agba.
It does not seem to be.	O yighị ka ọ ga-abụ.
It will look like it is now.	Ọ ga-adị ka ọ dị ugbu a.
This is the job he wants.	Nke a bụ ọrụ ọ chọrọ.
He asked me to come immediately.	Ọ gwara m ka m bịa ozugbo.
But tough.	Ma siri ike.
One can call this new news by interest.	Mmadụ nwere ike ịkpọ ozi ọma ọhụrụ a site na mmasị.
And having someone there to tell you that.	Na inwe onye ebe ahụ ka ọ gwa gị nke ahụ.
The paths should be different.	Ụzọ ndị ahụ kwesịrị ịdị iche.
They do it.	Ha maka ya.
I was upset to do so.	O were m iwe maka ime nke ahụ.
Man up.	Nwoke elu.
But somehow he could not.	Ma n'ụzọ ụfọdụ, o nweghị ike.
But the last question was on my mind.	Ma ajụjụ ikpeazụ ahụ dị m n’obi.
Suggested question.	Ajụjụ a tụrụ aro.
We do not know who they are, or where they come from.	Anyị amaghị ndị ha bụ, ma ọ bụ ebe ha si.
He did not want to.	Ọ chọghị.
He tried to think logically.	Ọ gbalịrị iji ezi uche na-eche echiche.
Here I am, you know.	A bụ m, ị maara.
Again it is very different.	Ọzọ ọ dị nnọọ ihe dị iche.
It’s so cute for it.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu maka ya.
His parents are machines.	Nne na nna ya bụ igwe.
There are many tall houses here.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụlọ ogologo ebe a.
Do everything possible.	Mee ihe ọ bụla kwere omume.
It is very beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
If he ran away.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ gbara ọsọ .
Everyone every day.	Onye ọ bụla kwa ụbọchị.
It will be one year.	Ọ ga-abụ otu afọ.
You have a gift.	Ị nwere onyinye.
Patients at any given time are not the same.	Ndị ọrịa n'oge ọ bụla abụghị otu.
He looks like his grandfather.	Ọ dị ka nna nna ya.
He ate a solid breakfast.	O riri nri ụtụtụ siri ike.
We have so many things.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ ihe.
The game seems to be played there.	Egwuregwu ahụ yiri ka a na-agba ya ebe ahụ.
Now we have it.	Ugbu a, anyị nwere ya.
Now let me help you.	Ugbu a, ka m nyere gị aka.
Two people are at the port.	Mmadụ abụọ nọ n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
So you are here alone.	Ya mere ị nọ ebe a naanị gị.
I don't want to see them again.	Achọghị m ịhụ ha ọzọ.
Our people have a long career.	Ndị obodo anyị nwere ogologo oge ọrụ aka.
He did not know very well.	Ọ maghị nke ọma.
The rest of it is pretty simple.	Ndị ọzọ n'ime ya mara mma dị mfe.
You can see many towers in the city.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ọtụtụ ụlọ elu n'ime obodo ahụ.
I wonder when this will happen.	M na-eche mgbe nke a ga-eme.
All of this works well.	Ihe a niile na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
They left the game in the head.	Ha hapụrụ egwuregwu ahụ n'isi.
This is a question for dog lovers.	Nke a bụ ajụjụ maka ndị hụrụ nkịta n'anya.
I hope you are well.	Enwere m olileanya na ị dị mma.
But that is difficult.	Mana nke ahụ siri ike.
The place is so beautiful.	Ebe ahụ mara ezigbo mma.
I hope you are doing well.	Enwere m olileanya na ị na-eme nke ọma.
But it was a beautiful plane.	Mana ọ bụ ụgbọ elu mara mma.
Fires spread everywhere in a few minutes.	Ọkụ gbasara ebe niile n'ime nkeji ole na ole.
Because we have health.	N'ihi na anyị nwere ahụ ike.
This city is a beautiful place.	Obodo a bụ ebe mara mma.
I run behind.	M na-agba ọsọ n'azụ.
Two possible situations can occur.	Enwere ike ime ọnọdụ abụọ nwere ike ime.
For his mother, for his sister.	Maka nne ya, maka nwanne ya nwanyị.
Go where he wants you to go.	Na-aga ebe ọ chọrọ ka ị gaa.
I always say.	M na-ekwu mgbe niile.
But now it will be different.	Ma ugbu a, ọ ga-adị iche.
It is unknown at this time.	A maghị ihe ha hụrụ.
That could be bad.	Nke nwere ike ịdị njọ.
They entered the room.	Ha banyere n'ime ụlọ.
Not this too.	Ọ bụghị nke a kwa.
And fast.	Na ngwa ngwa.
But most of us cannot do that.	Ma anyị ọtụtụ ndị enweghị ike ime otú ahụ.
It happened to both of us.	O mere anyị abụọ.
Your head is high.	Isi gị dị elu.
He may not know what everyone else thinks.	O nwere ike ghara ịma ihe onye ọ bụla ọzọ chere banyere ya.
It is a wonderful gift for the family.	Ọ bụ ezi onyinye nye ezinụlọ.
And how much.	Na ole.
The children are amazed.	Ihe a juru ụmụaka ahụ anya.
That, of course, is human.	Nke ahụ, n'ezie, bụ mmadụ.
There was little they could do.	Ọ dị ntakịrị ihe ha nwere ike ime.
I am happy with it.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ya.
Of course you are not gay.	N'ezie ị bụghị nwoke nwere mmasị nwoke.
No one has anything.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ihe ọ bụla.
He died immediately.	Ọ nwụrụ ozugbo.
If all goes well, we will go straight home.	Ọ bụrụ na ihe niile na-aga nke ọma, anyị ga-aga ozugbo n'ụlọ.
I have a lot of things to do.	Enwere m ọtụtụ ihe ọ ga-eme.
Na na.	Na na.
Now, let’s do this thoroughly.	Ugbu a, ka anyị mee nke a nke ọma.
Which is very reasonable.	Nke bụ nnọọ ezi uche.
I used my life as an example.	Eji m ndụ m mee ihe atụ.
Frequency is high.	Ugboro dị elu.
Get out!	Pụọ!
To help them.	Iji nyere ha aka.
At school.	N'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
She is more beautiful than herself.	Ọ mara mma karịa n'onwe ya.
Something is coming.	Ihe na-abịa.
But you have time, it’s something else.	Ma ị nwere oge, ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
That was his first thought.	Nke ahụ bụ echiche mbụ ya.
She has a good body.	O nwere ezigbo ahụ.
Maybe they have a financial problem.	Ma eleghị anya, ha nwere nsogbu ego.
I do not know what is happening to him.	Amaghị m ihe na-eme ya.
One of these days.	Otu n'ime ụbọchị ndị a.
Their time is beautiful.	Oge ha mara mma.
It is one of the rules.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime iwu.
He could not tell me where he was going.	O nweghị ike ịgwa m ebe ọ na-aga.
Almost everyone hates them.	Ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ onye ọ bụla kpọrọ ha asị.
I did not know what to do there.	Amaghị m ihe m ga-eme n'ebe ahụ.
That is if it never goes faster than what we saw.	Nke ahụ bụ ma ọ bụrụ na ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-aga ngwa ngwa karịa ihe anyị hụrụ.
I liked the story.	Akụkọ ahụ masịrị m.
Some have gifts.	Ụfọdụ ndị nwere onyinye.
I want you to come.	Achọrọ m ka ị bịa.
They are angry.	Ha dara iwe.
To do the same.	Iji mee otu mmetụta ahụ.
She is known to be abusive at school.	A mara ya ka ọ na-eme ihe ọjọọ n’ụlọ akwụkwọ.
I love the way your mind works and what you say.	Ahụrụ m ụzọ uche gị si arụ ọrụ na ihe ị na-ekwu n'anya.
At one point he thought it was funny.	N'otu oge o chere na ọ bụ ihe ọchị.
We should hate such things.	Anyị kwesịrị ịkpọ ihe ndị dị otú ahụ asị.
Would you like to.	Ọ ga-amasị gị.
His feet are in cold water.	Ụkwụ ya dị na mmiri oyi.
I'm not telling you to do this.	Anaghị m asị gị mee nke a.
I love it more than this.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya karịa otu a.
What others think of me is not my own.	Ihe ndị ọzọ na-eche banyere m abụghị nke m.
It comes a little late.	Ọ na-abịa obere oge.
Fortunately, he did.	Ọ dị mma na o mere otú ahụ.
This is going to be bigger and better.	Nke a na-aga ibu na mma.
Nothing serious.	Ọ dịghị mkpa.
The book is a lie.	Akwụkwọ ahụ bụ ụgha.
But it's a great place.	Mana ọ bụ nnukwu ebe.
Many of my friends have none.	Ọtụtụ ndị enyi m enweghị nke ọ bụla.
This is an important moment in your life right now.	Nke a bụ oge dị mkpa na ndụ gị ugbu a.
Every day is a gift.	Ụbọchị ọ bụla bụ onyinye.
He is looking for a similar job now.	Ọ na-achọ ọrụ yiri ya ugbu a.
It is what we want to do.	Ọ bụ ihe anyị chọrọ ime.
Then, as soon as it started, it stopped.	Mgbe ahụ, ngwa ngwa dị ka ọ malitere, ọ kwụsịrị.
It is too hot in the distance.	Ọ dị oke ọkụ n'ebe dị anya.
In fact, they had their hard times.	N'ezie, ha nwere oge ihe isi ike ha.
It's kind of nice for him.	Ọ bụ ụdị mma maka ya.
Father and son are nearby.	Nna na nwa nwoke nọ nso.
Some things are more important.	Ihe ụfọdụ dị mkpa karịa.
Which is true, my dear.	Nke bụ eziokwu, ezigbo m.
I like everything about it.	Ihe niile gbasara ya na-atọ m ụtọ.
Still, it is impossible.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
Each teacher received money for their work.	Onye nkuzi ọ bụla nwetara ego maka ọrụ ha.
That is a lesson.	Nke ahụ bụ nkuzi.
You can not be greater than this.	Ị gaghị enwe ike ịdị ukwuu karịa nke a.
Not far away.	Ọ bụghị ebe dị anya.
Obviously the song is better.	O doro anya na ọ bụrụ abụ ka mma.
Our genuine interest is what keeps it out of here.	Ezigbo mmasị anyị bụ ihe na-eme ka ọ pụọ ebe a.
Now we think only, here.	Ugbu a, anyị na-eche naanị, ebe a.
We cannot believe what we are doing now.	Anyị enweghị ike ikweta ihe anyị mere ugbu a.
He is in a terrible place.	Ọ nọ n'ebe dị egwu.
I was afraid to leave.	Ụjọ na-atụ m ịpụ.

It makes you doubt.	Ọ na-eme ka ị nwee obi abụọ.
There are no challenges.	Enweghị ihe ịma aka.
About the man.	Ihe gbasara nwoke ahụ.
Of course immediately after dinner.	N'ezie ozugbo nri abalị.
He was hungry.	Agụụ juru ya obi.
I felt a sense of power for the first time in my life.	Enwere m mmetụta nke ike na nke mbụ ya ná ndụ m.
But this does happen.	Ma, nke a na-eme.
She begins to cry.	Ọ malitere ibe ákwá.
But then everything came to me.	Ma mgbe ahụ, ihe niile bịara m.
First of all, it is very beautiful.	Nke mbụ, ọ mara ezigbo mma.
We will both be happy.	Anyị abụọ ga-enwe obi ụtọ.
Great threat.	Nnukwu ihe egwu.
But it is an important fact.	Ma ọ bụ eziokwu dị mkpa.
This time nothing happened.	Oge a ọ dịghị ihe merenụ.
There will be a lot of work, and of course, work time.	A ga-enwe ọtụtụ ọrụ, na n'ezie, oge ọrụ ọrụ.

I thought she might have my little boy there.	Echere m na o nwere ike inwe obere nwa m nwoke n'ebe ahụ.
This is impossible.	Nke a enweghị ike ime.
He really knows the game.	Ọ maara egwuregwu ahụ n'ezie.
There are three major airports here.	Enwere nnukwu ọdụ ụgbọ elu atọ ebe a.
No patients were killed.	Ọ dịghị onye ọrịa nwụrụ.

The newspaper is strong.	Akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ siri ike.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Ọ bụghị nke mbụ mere otú ahụ.
The children began to weep,	Ụmụaka malitere ibe ákwá,

Nothing useful.	Ọ dịghị ihe bara uru ọ bụla.
If we only knew it then we would know.	Ọ bụrụ na anyị maara naanị ihe ahụ bụ mgbe ahụ anyị gaara ama.
We are just friends.	Anyị bụ nnọọ enyi.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.
Again and again and again.	Ugboro ugboro ugboro ugboro.
This city is in the countryside.	Obodo a dị n'ime ime obodo.
And many, many more.	Na ọtụtụ, ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ.
Meetings were held in the synagogue.	A na-enwe nzukọ n'ụlọ nzukọ.
This would be nice.	Nke a ga-adị mma.
Nice to see you again.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ gị ọzọ.
Stop it, he said.	Kwụsị ya, o kwuru.
The health of this city is not good.	Ahụ ike obodo a adịghị mma.

He has no doubts.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya n'obi.
You only need money for three weeks.	Ị chọrọ naanị ego maka izu atọ.
I'm not sure it's good.	Ejighị m n'aka na ọ dị mma.
Many workers live in these villages.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọrụ bi n'ime obodo ndị a.
I do not understand how to achieve this, but.	Aghọtaghị m ka esi nweta nke a, ma.
I ran for my life.	M gbara ọsọ maka ndụ m.
He was a comedian.	Ọ bụ onye ọchị ọchị.
He wants it to be very popular.	Ọ chọrọ ka a na-amasị ya nke ukwuu.
This city has only one port.	Obodo a nwere naanị otu ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri.
Just tell me what happens to you.	Naanị gwa m ihe na-eme gị.

In a city with few shops, he was happy.	N’otu obodo nke nwere ụlọ ahịa akwụkwọ ole na ole, obi dị ya ụtọ.

Most of our team are interested in it.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị otu anyị nwere mmasị na ya.
You will never miss it again.	Ị gaghị atụ uche ya ọzọ.

I am not happy anymore.	Enweghị m obi ụtọ ọzọ.
But not for this game.	Mana ọ bụghị maka egwuregwu a.
He lives near the city.	O bi nso obodo ahụ.
Then he stopped.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ kwụsịrị.
Still, boats and ships were abandoned.	Ma, n'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, a hapụrụ ụgbọ mmiri na ụgbọ mmiri.
Driving is not good.	Ịnya ụgbọ ahụ adịghị mma.

Dear girl!	Ezigbo nwa agbọghọ!

Not because it is more important.	Ọ bụghị n'ihi na ọ dị mkpa karịa.
This time is different.	Oge a dị iche.
I'm sure you're kidding.	Eji m n'aka na ị na-egwu egwu.
It’s what you do.	Ọ bụ ihe ị na-eme.
It would be a song during each holiday.	Ọ ga-abụ abụ n'oge ezumike ọ bụla.
A little bit.	Obere ntakịrị.
That is the only way to go.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị ụzọ ị ga-esi gaa.
Great staff, ready and capable.	Ndị ọrụ dị ukwuu, dị njikere ma nwee ike.
Cold.	Oyi.
This is something new for me.	Nke a bụ ihe ọhụrụ nye m.
They are very angry.	Iwe were ha nke ukwuu.
But it is not his priority at this time.	Mana ọ bụghị ihe kacha ya mkpa n'oge a.
This gives the material a different color.	Nke a na-eme ka ihe dị iche iche nwee agba dị iche iche.
Best to look at.	Kacha mma ka anya.
I know that for a fact.	Amaara m nke ahụ n'ezie.
But obviously he went and did it so it was impossible.	Mana o doro anya na ọ gara ma mee ya nke mere na ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
I have a feeling for it.	Enwere m mmetụta maka ya.
The job is a woman's job.	Ọrụ ahụ bụ ọrụ nwanyị.

The context is important.	Ihe gbara ya gburugburu dị mkpa.
It's too small.	Ọ dị obere ime.
Coming from.	Na-abịa site.
Some are beautiful.	Ụfọdụ na-ama mma.
But the eyes spoke in their own way.	Ma anya kwuru n'ụzọ nke aka ha.
I would like to interview his brother.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịgba nwanne ya ajụjụ ọnụ.
She may love her husband, but she is very important to him.	Ọ ga-abụ na ọ hụrụ di ya n’anya, ma ọ dị ya ezigbo mkpa.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
The soil there is fertile.	Ala ebe ahụ na-eme nri nke ọma.
But it makes me smile, it makes me happy.	Ma ọ na-eme m ọnụ ọchị, ọ na-eme m obi ụtọ.
Expected to be.	Echere ịbụ.
Each of them can be used.	Enwere ike iji nke ọ bụla n'ime ha mee ihe.
If you do not.	Ọ bụrụ na ị bụghị.
It may take until tomorrow.	O nwere ike were ruo echi.
He never spoke to me.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ gwara m okwu.
He sat down again.	Ọ nọdụ ala ọzọ.
Dear friend, a long time ago.	Ezigbo enyi, ogologo oge gara aga.
This is different from other nearby cities.	Nke a dị iche na obodo ndị ọzọ dị nso.
It's really beautiful.	Ọ mara mma n'ezie.
I can do the same.	Enwere m ike ime otu ihe ahụ.
Next, he left.	Nke ọzọ, ọ pụọ.
I always knew.	M maara mgbe niile.
He was busy with other things, but he did.	O ji ọrụ n'aka n'ihe ndị ọzọ, ma o mere.
There is no such thing.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ.
I can get out now.	Enwere m ike ịpụ ugbu a.
A new head for her, a woman, and.	Isi dị ọhụrụ nye ya, nwanyị, na .
Life is fun again.	Ndụ na-atọ ụtọ ọzọ.
Things are not good here for me.	Ihe adịghị mma ebe a ọ dị m.
Several tests were performed.	E mere ọtụtụ ule.
Drink a little.	Na-aṅụ ntakịrị.
When is the next meeting?	Kedu mgbe nzukọ ọzọ ga-eme?
He understood immediately.	Ọ ghọtara na ozugbo.
Like real fire.	Dị ka ezigbo ọkụ.
First of all, awesome music.	Nke mbụ, egwu egwu .
Most of the time, it doesn’t seem to matter.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ihe ọ bụla.
He should not, not until he speaks.	O kwesịghị, ọ bụghị ruo mgbe o kwuru okwu.
I think it was me.	Echere m na ọ bụ m.
Kids are good.	Ụmụaka dị mma.
They are good things.	Ha bụ ezigbo ihe.
So he did.	Ya mere, o mere nke ahụ.
However, it is important.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dị mkpa.
I told him on the phone.	Agwara m ya na ekwentị.
They do it every year and they love it.	Ha na-eme ya kwa afọ na ha hụrụ ya n'anya.
But there is no reason why it should be here.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe mere o kwesịrị ebe a.
These things were played.	E ji ihe ndị a mee egwu.
But that’s the point, it seems.	Ma nke ahụ bụ isi ihe, ọ dị ka.
He was wearing a simple police uniform.	O yi uwe ojii dị mfe.
I couldn’t in the past.	Enweghị m ike n'oge gara aga.
He loves her very much.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
Players should know what happened.	Ndị egwuregwu kwesịrị ịma ihe merenụ.
Happiness is that of saying.	Obi ụtọ bụ nke ikwu.
The drink is delicious.	Ihe ọṅụṅụ ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
Weekends may be high.	Ọnụ ahịa izu ụka nwere ike ịdị elu.
I wondered what I would do.	Echere m ihe m ga-eme.
Everyone is interested in marriage.	Onye ọ bụla nwere mmasị na nwunye.
He had two of them.	O nwere abụọ n'ime ha.
Obviously you can not.	O doro anya na ị nweghị ike.
But we do not know.	Ma anyị agaghị ama.
No words on his face.	Ọ dịghị okwu na ihu ya.
The magnitude and importance of the problem are clear.	Oke na mkpa nke nsogbu ahụ doro anya.
That would not have been easy.	Nke ahụ agaraghị adị mfe.
I love this old machine.	Ahụrụ m igwe ochie a n'anya.
But it was only two days.	Mana ọ bụ naanị ụbọchị abụọ.
So here is before and after.	Ya mere, ebe a bụ tupu na mgbe.
It is tomorrow.	Ọ bụ echi.
Let us help.	Ka anyị nyere aka.
It is a great speed.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ọsọ.
They never thought it would be different.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha chere na ọ pụrụ ịdị iche.
No events took place.	Ihe omume ọ bụla emeghị.
Work at our house.	Na-arụ ọrụ n'ụlọ anyị.
They have life.	Ha nwere ndụ.
When food is ready, provide information for his family.	Mgbe nri dị njikere, nye ezinụlọ ya ozi.
It has little to say.	Ọ dị ntakịrị ihe ikwu.
But we love them very much.	Ma anyị hụrụ ha n'anya nke ukwuu.
He may be easily hurt.	O nwere ike ịdị ya ngwa ngwa inwe mmetụta n'ezie.
They fled at night.	Ha gbara ọsọ n’abalị.
I do not know how to think about this.	Amaghị m ka m ga-esi na-eche banyere nke a.
The food and wine are good.	Nri dị na mmanya dị mma.
It's good tonight.	Ọ dị mma n'abalị a.
We are not different.	Anyị adịghị iche.
The only question is 'when'.	Naanị ajụjụ bụ 'mgbe'.
Of course, nothing more people say.	N'ezie, ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ndị mmadụ na-ekwu.
I think they did.	Echere m na ha mere ya.
But he did not see.	Ma ọ dịghị ahụ.
It's too long.	Ọ dị ogologo.
People exist here.	Ndị mmadụ dị adị ebe a.
He did well.	O mere nke ọma.
Her son was sitting in a nearby car.	Nwa ya nwoke nọ ọdụ n'otu ụgbọ ala dị nso.
Both statements are true.	Okwu abụọ a bụ eziokwu.
We will love this fight.	Anyị ga-enwe mmasị na ọgụ a.
We don't want to see it happen again.	Anyị achọghị ịhụ ka ọ mee ọzọ.
The car suddenly stopped.	Ụgbọala ahụ kwụsịrị na mberede.
He was full of ideas.	O juru echiche.
We keep things simple.	Anyị na-eme ka ihe dị mfe.
This is the perfect word.	Nke a bụ okwu zuru oke.
His eyes met hers.	Anya ya zutere ya.
It's hard to see.	O siri ike ịhụ.
There is nothing wrong with wanting to look good.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị njọ ịhụ ịma mma nke ahụ mmadụ.
This event will be the highlight of his career.	Ihe omume a ga-abụ isi ihe na ọrụ ya.
Both types are unknown, because that is the point.	Ụdị abụọ a amaghị, n'ihi na nke ahụ bụ isi ihe.
Days go by.	Ụbọchị na-aga.
Your work, my man.	Ọrụ gị, nwoke m.
I am still in school.	M ka nọ n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
Soon he heard about it.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, ọ nụrụ banyere ya.
I think it's wrong.	Echere m na ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ.
Kind of.	Ịdị ka.
This question is important.	Ajụjụ a dị mkpa.
He has something else in it.	O nwere ihe ọzọ na ya.
Now that’s awesome.	Ugbu a nke ahụ dị oke egwu.
They are good football players.	Ha bụ ezigbo onye egwuregwu bọọlụ.
Every chance he got, he got his way.	Ohere ọ bụla o nwetara, o nwetara ụzọ ya.
I never wanted you, you know.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chọrọ gị, ị maara.
This is not his cute little house.	Nke a abụghị obere ụlọ ya mara mma.
You have to move on with your life.	Ị ga-aga n'ihu na ndụ gị.
I like to do just about anything fun.	Ọ na-amasị m ime naanị ihe ọ bụla na-atọ ụtọ.
That's when it happened.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka o mere.
Not every father needs us.	Ọ bụghị nna ọ bụla n’ime anyị mkpa.
It was last year.	Ọ bụ n'afọ gara aga.
He did not know that.	Ọ maghị nke ahụ.
By recently.	Site nso nso.
The reason is simple.	Ihe kpatara ya doro anya.
Other groups run to raise money.	Ndị ọzọ dị iche iche na-agba ọsọ iji nweta ego.
We should not take them lightly.	Anyị ekwesịghị iji ha egwu egwu.
This will continue in the application now.	Nke a ga-aga n'ihu na ngwa ugbu a.
no.	mba.
It could be something else.	Ọ nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọzọ.
But it is awesome.	Ma ọ dị egwu.
You do not need.	Ị dịghị mkpa .
Sometimes negative emotions.	Mgbe ụfọdụ mmetụta na-adịghị mma.
It is not.	Ọ bụghị ya.
The bar is unique in local cuisine.	Ụlọ mmanya ahụ pụrụ iche na nri obodo.
When the man is doing well in the test.	Mgbe nwoke ahụ na-eme nke ọma na ule.
Everyone.	Onye ọ bụla.
This is a beautiful house.	Nke a bụ ụlọ mara mma.
Teaching is a very important task.	Nkuzi bụ ọrụ dị oke mkpa.
I helped.	M nyere aka.
It concerns your daughter.	Ọ gbasara nwa gị nwanyị.
But not for long.	Ma ọ bụghị ogologo oge.
I can’t make myself eat too much.	Enweghị m ike ime onwe m iri nri nke ukwuu.
I like the name of the group.	Aha otu ahụ masịrị m.
One has a name.	Otu nwere aha.
We expect similar feelings for children emotionally.	Anyị tụrụ anya mmetụta yiri nke ahụ maka nsogbu mmetụta uche ụmụaka.
You take a job.	Ị were ọrụ.
It's useless.	O nweghị isi.
Of course, none of the books are really beautiful.	N'ezie, ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime akwụkwọ ndị ahụ mara mma n'ezie.
This practice continued for some time.	Omume a gara n'ihu ruo nwa oge.
Can't be happier.	Enweghị ike inwe obi ụtọ karịa.
That is more than one in three countries.	Nke ahụ karịrị otu n'ime mba atọ ọ bụla.
He runs his own house.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ nke ụlọ ya.
You know it's bad but it's very good.	Ị maara na ọ dị njọ mana ọ dị mma nke ukwuu.
What you say will be very different.	Ihe ahụ gị na-ekwu ga-adị nnọọ iche.
A lot of things happened.	Ọtụtụ ihe mere.
Would be a funny photo.	Ga-abụ foto na-atọ ọchị.
It is my problem.	Ọ bụ nsogbu m.
For that, I need a chance from you.	Maka nke ahụ, achọrọ m ohere n'aka gị.
He never did that to me.	Ọ dịghị mgbe o mere m otú ahụ.
It's fun to let your friends know.	Ọ bụ ihe obi ụtọ ime ka ndị enyi gị mara.
I know my father.	Amaara m nna m.
He knows everything.	Ọ mara ihe ọ bụla.
But this requires something.	Mana nke a chọrọ ihe.
Maybe there is a reason.	O nwere ike ịbụ na o nwere ihe kpatara ya.
They say things.	Ha na-ekwu ihe.
Just blame each other.	Naanị ụta onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
That is a dog.	Nke ahụ bụ nkịta.
The group told him that they did not like his idea.	Ndị otu ahụ gwara ya na echiche ya adịghị amasị ha.
He was angry.	O were iwe.
Stupid behavior.	Omume nzuzu.
I have the same issue.	Enwere m otu okwu ahụ.
The solid plan will be three.	Atụmatụ siri ike ga-abụ atọ.
From here to there.	Si ebe a gaa ebe ahụ.
I was terrified, it was me.	Ụjọ tụrụ m nke ukwuu, ọ bụ m n'ezie.
I think more than anyone at home.	Echere m karịa onye ọ bụla nọ n'ụlọ.
It was an awesome event.	Ọ bụ ihe omume dị egwu.
However, good words.	Otú ọ dị, ezigbo okwu.
Some will not see why.	Ụfọdụ agaghị ahụ ya mere.
He was given three books.	E nyere ya akwụkwọ atọ.
I shot it four times.	M gbara ya ugboro anọ.
Lots of beautiful restaurants.	Ọtụtụ ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ mara mma.
They were expected to live.	A tụrụ anya na ha ga-adị ndụ.
But if anything can make it worse, it has.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla nwere ike ime ka ọ ka njọ, ọ nwere.
The same is beautiful.	Otu ahụ mara mma.
Of course, this would be awesome.	N'ezie, nke a ga-adị egwu.
They are on his head.	Ha nọ n'isi ya.
We have a big problem.	Anyị nwere nnukwu nsogbu.
Still, few examples are alive.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ihe atụ ole na ole dị ndụ.
They are not good if they run well.	Ha adịghị mma ma ọ bụrụ na ha na-agba nke ọma.
For me, this is not a hot topic.	Maka m, nke a abụghị ihe ọkụ.
The event will continue on two separate tracks.	Ihe omume ga-aga n'ihu na egwu abụọ dị iche iche.
It goes faster than the human eye can follow.	Ọ na-aga ngwa ngwa karịa ka anya mmadụ nwere ike iso.
I ran to feel.	M gbara ọsọ ka m nwee mmetụta.
We got it all.	Anyị nwetara ihe ahụ niile.
The runners are dead.	Ndị na-agba ọsọ nwụrụ anwụ.
Either the medicine is bad or bad.	Ma ọ bụ ọgwụ adịghị mma ma ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ.
I'm glad they were really happy together.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ha nwere obi ụtọ ọnụ n'ezie.
The last one is cold.	Nke ikpeazụ bụ jụrụ oyi.
One can take it.	Mmadụ nwere ike were ya.
There is a shop in the building.	Enwere ụlọ ahịa na ụlọ ahụ.
This is very basic.	Nke a bụ nnọọ isi.
But if all goes well.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ihe niile gara nke ọma.
He did it better than anyone else.	O mere ya nke ọma karịa onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
It is best to use a water machine.	Ọ kacha mma iji igwe igwe mmiri.
There is no better time now.	Ọ dịghị oge ka mma ugbu a.
Valuable offer for both new and old employees.	Onyinye bara uru maka ma ndị ọrụ ọhụrụ na ndị ochie.

We know what we say, let us help you !.	Anyị maara ihe anyị na-ekwu, ka anyị nyere gị aka!.
A few years.	Afọ ole na ole.
I don’t think we’ll come up with that yet.	Echeghị m na anyị ga-abịa na nke ahụ ma.

His mother was right.	Nne ya kwuru eziokwu.
It took him three hours to get there from home.	O were ya awa atọ iji si ebe ahụ gaa ụlọ.
It is almost there now.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ebe ahụ ugbu a.
We are not close.	Anyị anọghị nso.
This is a plan that kids know and enjoy.	Nke a bụ atụmatụ ụmụaka maara ma nwee obi ụtọ.
We have a word for this.	Anyị nwere okwu maka nke a.
He lives very close to me.	Ọ bi nnọọ nso m.
She is upset tonight.	Obi adịghị ya mma n'abalị a.
I do not want trouble now.	Achọghị m nsogbu ugbu a.
Not many of our clients do it.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ndị ahịa anyị na-eme ya.
Wear your indoor shoes.	Yiri akpụkpọ ụkwụ ime ụlọ gị.
I am three years old.	Adị m atọ.

So far there have been only a handful of cases reported.	Ruo ugbu a enwere naanị akụkọ ikpe ole na ole dị.
The reason is clear.	O doro anya ihe kpatara ya.
That summer, however, was the first time I had not had my parents.	Otú ọ dị, n'oge okpomọkụ ahụ, bụ nke mbụ m na-enweghị ndị mụrụ m.
It is still small.	Ọ ka dị obere.
We will do better.	Anyị ga-eme ihe nke ọma.
To give a better life.	Iji nye ndụ ka mma.
But that is a good picture.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ezigbo foto.
We are not police here.	Anyị abụghị ndị uwe ojii ebe a.
I want them to know.	Achọrọ m ka ha mara ya.
But it did happen.	Ma n'ezie o mere.
The first and third conditions are immediate.	Ọnọdụ nke mbụ na nke atọ bụ ozugbo.
He cannot see very well.	Ọ naghị ahụ nke ọma.
It is so now.	Ọ bụ otú ahụ ugbu a.
That will not be easy.	Nke ahụ agaghị adị mfe.
Things are different here.	Ihe dị iche ebe a ugbu a.
You certainly did more than we expected.	I mere n'ezie karịa ihe anyị tụrụ anya ya.
He did well, though.	O mere nke ọma, n'agbanyeghị.
Pregnancy work.	Ọrụ ime.
The second idea is ignorance.	Echiche nke abụọ bụ enweghị uche.
Her husband quickly gained confidence.	Di ya nwetara obi ike ngwa ngwa.
The study was conducted over a period of three years.	E mere ọmụmụ ihe ahụ ihe karịrị afọ atọ.
They were doing well.	Ha nọ na-eme nke ọma.
I know we are friends.	Ama m na anyị bụ enyi.
This is not at all.	Nke a abụghị ma ọlị.
That happened in the first place.	Nke ahụ mere na mbụ.
You have no help.	Ị nweghị enyemaka.
You look like you are 12 years old.	Ị dị ka ị dị afọ iri na abụọ.
We are the only ones who have them now.	Ọ bụ naanị anyị ka nwere ha ugbu a.
No one is afraid of us.	Ọ dịghị onye na-atụ egwu anyị.
He would not tell me.	Ọ gaghị agwa m.
It is better to go.	Ọ ka mma ịga.
Because there is something wrong with him.	N'ihi na o nwere ihe ọjọọ.
Good news, bad news and terrible news.	Ozi ọma, ozi ọjọọ na ozi dị oke egwu.
I thought about it a lot.	M chere banyere ya nke ukwuu.
I am not alone.	Ọ bụghị naanị m.
He was doing it sure.	Ọ nọ na-eme n'aka.
But they really are.	Ma ha bụ n'ezie.
But when he started, he was another man.	Ma mgbe ọ malitere, ọ bụ nwoke ọzọ.
That is not a problem.	Nke ahụ abụghị nsogbu.
Students are interested in the lesson.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ nwere mmasị na nkuzi ahụ.

He came from here.	O si gburugburu ebe a bịa.
I have hope.	Enwere m olileanya.
Take it easy on yourself.	Were ya dị mfe n'onwe gị.
Now it looks like any other house.	Ugbu a ọ dị ka ụlọ ọ bụla ọzọ.
This work is not very popular.	Ọrụ a enweghị mmasị nke ukwuu.
He said it was just fire.	O kwuru na ọ bụ naanị ọkụ.
Two other friends are in the background.	Ndị enyi gị abụọ ndị ọzọ nọ n'azụ.
This organization has a huge impact on the country.	Nzukọ a na-enwe mmetụta dị ukwuu na mba ahụ.
He thought he would go back.	O chere na ọ ga-aga azụ.
We have a three-day weekend ahead of us.	Anyị nwere izu ụka ụbọchị atọ n'ihu anyị.
We were good friends and did everything together.	Anyị bụ ezigbo enyi ma mee ihe niile ọnụ.
For his people.	Maka ndị ya.
Not scary, but they would have been much better.	Ọ bụghị egwu, mana ha gaara aka mma.
Maybe he'll want to see me again.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ ga-achọ ịhụ m ọzọ.
They do not want much more.	Ha achọghị ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ.
Each house is made of special materials.	E ji ihe ndị pụrụ iche mee ụlọ nke ọ bụla.
But if they can’t, it’s not really my problem.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ha enweghị ike, ọ bụghị n'ezie nsogbu m.
But it is a lot of work.	Mana ọ bụ oke ọrụ.
But of course, there is nothing wrong with that.	Ma n'ezie, ọ dịghị ihe ọjọọ.
This is, for me, a problem.	Nke a bụ, nye m, nsogbu.
I think that’s a good new name for you newcomer.	Echere m na nke ahụ bụ ezi aha ọhụrụ maka gị ọhụrụ.
But it was very young.	Ma ọ bụ nnọọ nwata.
No fear, nothing.	Enweghị egwu, o nweghị ihe ọ bụla.
It can.	O nwere ike.
Useful.	Ihe bara uru.
Women can see it.	Ụmụ nwanyị nwere ike ịhụ ya.
He called the woman.	Ọ kpọrọ nwanyị ahụ.
Everyone knows each other.	Onye ọ bụla maara ibe ya.
In them, something else.	Na ha, ihe ọzọ.
Everything went away quickly.	Ihe niile wee pụọ ngwa ngwa.
I don't like them.	Anaghị m enwe mmasị n'ebe ha nọ.
Their new home has another room.	Ụlọ ọhụrụ ha nwere ọnụ ụlọ ọzọ.
There will be a price for his service.	A ga-enwe ọnụ ahịa maka ozi ya.
The community is well aware of these statements.	Ndị obodo maara nke ọma okwu ndị a.
It goes on and on.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu.
Just now.	Naanị ugbu a.
They are looking for a reason why they should not do it the first time.	Ha na-achọ ihe mere ha agaghị eme nke mbụ ahụ.
It really works.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ n'ezie.
Not for me, this is my house.	Ọ bụghị nye m, nke a bụ ụlọ m.
I told him so.	Agwara m ya otú ahụ.
No one knows where his father is.	O nweghị onye ma ebe nna ya nọ.
Perfect for a weekend getaway.	Ọ zuru oke maka njem ezumike izu ụka.
The boy was angry.	Iwe were nwata ahụ.
I do not want you.	Achọghị m gị.
He made a great film.	O mere ihe nkiri dị egwu.
This is a logical practice.	Nke a bụ omume ezi uche dị na ya.
There is a book inside.	E nwere akwụkwọ n'ime.
Every day is hard.	Ọ bụla ụbọchị siri ike.

Such an important book, without help.	Akwụkwọ dị mkpa dị otú ahụ, enweghị enyemaka.
Not long after, wife!	Ogologo oge ahụghị, nwunye!
We have that moment.	Anyị nwere oge ahụ.
They make him happy.	Ha na-eme ya obi ụtọ.
How long did they go?	Ogologo oge ole ka ha gara.
This was very difficult at first.	Nke a siri ike nke ukwuu na mbụ.
But those things are true.	Ma ihe ndị ahụ bụ eziokwu.
It’s fun and expensive.	Ọ bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ ma dị oke ọnụ ahịa.
Then they can get whatever they want.	Mgbe ahụ, ha nwere ike nweta ihe ọ bụla ha chọrọ.
But school.	Ma ụlọ akwụkwọ.
He called me, and we were going to have lunch.	Ọ kpọrọ m, anyị ga-aga iri nri ehihie.

It paused for a moment.	Ọ kwụsịrị obere oge.
That impressed me very much.	Nke ahụ masịrị m nke ukwuu.
It's useless.	O nweghị isi.
New money, of course.	Ego ọhụrụ, n'ezie.
Again, just that.	Ọzọ, naanị nke ahụ.
The meat we eat.	Anụ anyị na-eri.
Everyone loves children.	Onye ọ bụla hụrụ ụmụaka n'anya.

In fact, she would have liked it very much.	N'ezie, ọ gaara amasị ya nke ukwuu.

For many others, the new law will have more impact.	Maka ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ, iwu ọhụrụ ga-enwe mmetụta karịa.

But once he saw it, he could go anywhere.	Ma, ọ hụrụ ozugbo, ọ pụrụ ịga ebe ọ bụla.
That makes it better.	Nke ahụ na-eme ka ọ ka mma.

Then we will have big problems.	Mgbe ahụ anyị ga-enwe nnukwu nsogbu.
Sometimes he does not.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ naghị eme ya.

When people do what they love, you can tell it.	Mgbe ndị mmadụ na-eme ihe ha hụrụ n'anya, ị nwere ike ịgwa ya.
At that time children were different.	N'oge ahụ ụmụaka dị iche.
Many people say they have seen it.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-ekwu na ha hụrụ ya.
This man clearly stated his plan.	Nwoke a kwuru atụmatụ ya nke ọma.
Or at least he says he is.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ na-ekwu na ọ bụ.
However, some of those benefits are yet to come.	Otú ọ dị, ụfọdụ n'ime uru ndị ahụ ka ga-abịa.
Running is not his sport.	Ọsọ abụghị egwuregwu ya.
I'm sure there will be.	Eji m n'aka na a ga-enwe.
Drink plenty of fluids.	Na-aṅụ ọtụtụ mmiri mmiri.
He hated her.	Ọ kpọrọ ime ya asị.
He saw what was done to them.	Ọ hụrụ ihe e mere ha.
You don't have much to do.	O nweghị ọtụtụ ihe ị ga-eme.
Either way.	N'ụzọ ọ bụla.
This is a housework question.	Nke a bụ ajụjụ ọrụ ụlọ.
At the same time, they eat a lot of meat.	N'otu oge ahụ, ha na-eri ọtụtụ anụ.
He said so well.	O kwuru nke ọma.
But you must do it.	Ma ị ga-eme ya.
This could not be further from the truth.	Nke a enweghị ike ịbụ ihe ọzọ site na eziokwu.
His anger, and the distance it caused.	Iwe ya, na ebe dị anya nke ọ kpatara.
He invited someone to do that.	Ọ kpọrọ mmadụ ka o mee nke ahụ.
This can be a problem.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ nsogbu.
It sounds like a lot of fun.	Ọ dị ka ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
The flight took two hours.	Njem ụgbọ elu were awa abụọ.
He is surprised when he hears the news.	O juru ya anya mgbe ọ nụrụ akụkọ ahụ.
You told me the truth.	Ị gwara m eziokwu.
Two patients died.	Ndị ọrịa abụọ nwụrụ.
He was such a runner.	Ọ bụ onye na-agba ọsọ dị otú ahụ.
See what's new there.	Hụ ihe ọhụrụ dị n'ebe ahụ.
There is still much to be done.	A ka nwere ọtụtụ ihe a ga-eme.
It is good to get away from everything.	Ọ dị mma isi n'ihe niile pụọ.
The law will not tell you that.	Iwu agaghị agwa gị nke ahụ.
I do not want the idea of ​​making him angry.	Achọghị m ka echiche ime ya iwe iwe.
All he said was to give her time.	Ihe niile o kwuru bụ inye ya oge.
The grocery store is no longer functioning than before.	Ụlọ ahịa nri anaghị arụ ọrụ karịa ka ọ dị na mbụ.
Companies need to be faced with bad times.	Ndị ụlọ ọrụ kwesịrị ịdị na-eche ihu n'oge ọjọọ.
I love him as much as others.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya dị ka ndị ọzọ.
Everyone wants each other.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ ibe ya.
Name does not matter.	Aha adịghị mkpa.
It makes perfect sense if you think about it.	Ọ na-eme ka uche zuru oke ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-eche banyere ya.
I continue to do so.	M na-aga n'ihu na-eme otú ahụ.
Sit next to me.	Nọdụ ala n'akụkụ m.
You have children.	Ị nwere ụmụ.
Many people think of it.	Ọtụtụ ndị nwere echiche banyere ya.
Tell people what is happening.	Gwa ndị mmadụ ihe na-eme.
I am still traveling.	M ka nọ na njem.
However, she did not seem to mind.	Otú ọ dị, o yighị ihe ọ na-eche.
I think it should be you.	Echere m na ọ kwesịrị ịbụ gị.
Go and buy your whole family home.	Gaa zụta ụlọ ezinụlọ gị niile.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.
He did not want to help her.	Ọ chọghị inyere ya aka.
Way back and much more.	Ụzọ azụ na mbụ ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ.
And he went away for a while.	O wee pụọ ruo nwa oge .
Give it to both of us.	Nye anyị abụọ.
It is one of his.	Ọ bụ otu nke ya.
It seems weak now.	Ọ dị ka ihe adịghị ike ugbu a.
He handed her the letter.	O nyere ya akwụkwọ ozi ahụ.
Which is very nice.	Nke dị nnọọ mma.
The idea is good.	Echiche ahụ dị mma.
It’s kind of stopped being fun to play.	Ọ bụ ụdị kwụsịrị ịbụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ igwu egwu.
But it is cold here.	Ma oyi na-atụ n'ebe a.
Here no one knows me.	N'ebe a, ọ dịghị onye maara m.
If it makes you feel good, it’s okay.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ na-eme ka obi dị gị mma, ọ dị mma.
Or so we think.	Ma ọ bụ otú anyị chere.
He knows their names.	Ọ ma aha ha.

It's really nice.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mma.
Give me another chance to make that day come sooner.	Nye m ohere ọzọ ka ụbọchị ahụ bịa ngwa ngwa.
Inside, he was on his own.	N'ime, ọ nọ n'akụkụ onwe ya.
That was long, with some food in front of me.	Nke ahụ dị ogologo, nke nwere ụfọdụ nri n'ihu m.
It's so delicious.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
I can not know if it is good to be bad.	Enweghị m ike ịma ma ọ dị mma ka ọ dị njọ.
That is what it should be.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe kwesịrị ịbụ.
They will not know anything for a while.	Ha agaghị ama ihe ọ bụla nwa oge.
No problem.	Enweghị nsogbu ọ bụla.
No matter what.	N'agbanyeghị ihe mere.
It will not happen.	Agaghị eme eme.
We were born in a foreign land	A mụrụ anyị ná mba dị iche iche
Now we have a second chance.	Ugbu a, anyị nwere ohere nke abụọ.
I just got started.	M ka malitere.
But you are.	Ma ị bụ .
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, o kwesịrị.
That sounds good.	Nke ahụ dị ha ezigbo mma.
His film made his name known.	Ihe nkiri ya mere ka ọ mara aha ya.
Women do it.	Ụmụ nwanyị na-eme ya.
It does not give us hope.	Ọ naghị eme ka anyị nwee olileanya.
Locals say the past is another city.	Ndị obodo na-ekwu na oge gara aga bụ obodo ọzọ.
All of these can be true at one time.	Ihe ndị a niile nwere ike ịbụ eziokwu n'otu oge.
Does he owe you anything?	O ji gị ụgwọ ọ bụla?
It is very difficult to be here.	O siri ezigbo ike ịnọ ebe a.
He has a good friend.	O nwere ezigbo enyi.
I am looking for something like this.	A na m achọ ihe dị ka nke a.
But miss the rest of the season.	Ma na-atụ uche ndị ọzọ nke oge.
He continued in front of the building.	Ọ gara n'ihu n'ihu ụlọ ahụ.
She heard him enter.	Ọ nụrụ ka ọ banyere.
I like it more than that.	Ọ masịrị m ya karịa ya.
This is beautiful.	Nke a mara mma.
Please stop calling!	Biko kwụsị ịkpọ!
Prices will be higher.	Ahịa ga-adị elu karịa.
I have other plans for it.	Enwere m atụmatụ ndị ọzọ maka ya.

We are sure.	Anyị ji n'aka.
But none of these things are new.	Ma ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a bụ ihe ọhụrụ.
We are afraid of him.	Anyị na-atụ ya egwu.
Those things.	Ihe ndị ahụ.
You have to plan.	Ị ga-eme atụmatụ.
Not always.	Ọ bụghị mgbe ọ bụla.
Everyone wants to play.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ igwu egwu.
There will be a mouthful.	A ga-enwe ọnụ ọnụ.
We need to carry weight.	Anyị kwesịrị ibu ibu.
Will you go?	Ị ga-aga?
Few people have.	Mmadụ ole na ole nwere.
It doesn't look like much.	Ọ naghị adị ka nke ukwuu.
Undoubtedly there is.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na e nwere.
Then he got into the waiting car.	Mgbe ahụ ọ banyere ụgbọ ala chere.
Drink the water.	Na-aṅụ mmiri ahụ.
If so.	Ọ bụrụ na o nwere.
You just do not want it.	Naanị ị chọghị ya.
Or can not say.	Ma ọ bụ enweghị ike ikwu.
The other three methods do not work well.	Ụzọ atọ ndị ọzọ adịghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
He never goes back.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-aga azụ.
I do not like this song.	Egwu a anaghị amasị m.
Probably a number of them should.	Ma eleghị anya, ọtụtụ n'ime ha kwesịrị.
Be there at 3pm this afternoon.	Nọ ebe ahụ n'elekere atọ nke ehihie a.
He was a very different person.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ụdị mmadụ dị iche.
It was almost bedtime.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ oge ụra.
This is a little closer to home.	Nke a dị ntakịrị nso n'ụlọ.
Age.	Afọ.
We are scared, of course.	Anyị na-atụ ụjọ, n'ezie.
Consumers may now have more.	Ndị na-eri ihe ugbu a nwere ike ka ukwuu.
Everything is fine and simple again.	Ihe niile dị mma ma dị mfe ọzọ.
This time there seems to be no question.	Oge a ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ajụjụ.
It's fast.	Ọ dị ngwa ngwa.
The basement is very cold.	Ụlọ ala dị ezigbo oyi.
It was probably because of poor health.	Ọ ga-abụ na ọ dara ya n'ihi enweghị ahụ ike.
The plaintiff refused.	Onye gbara akwụkwọ jụrụ.
And not only this.	Ọ bụghị naanị nke a.
I refused that way.	M jụrụ ụzọ ahụ.
They are not wanted.	Achọghị ha.

I'm glad I got it there.	Enwere m obi ụtọ na m nwetara ya ebe ahụ.
I saw him in awe.	Ahụrụ m ya ka ọ na-atụ egwu.
There are other issues.	Enwere nsogbu ndị ọzọ.
You have a good way with words.	Ị nwere ezigbo ụzọ na okwu.
But of course, there is not much life there.	Ma n'ezie, ọ dịghị ọtụtụ ndụ n'ebe ahụ.
I need one needed way.	Achọrọ m otu ụzọ mkpa.
This is awesome to see.	Nke a dị egwu ịhụ.
It is a high quality restaurant.	Ọ bụ ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ dị elu.
It does not make sense.	Ọ bụghị ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
The woman died early in the morning.	Nwanyị ahụ nwụrụ n’isi ụtụtụ.
I miss my co-workers.	A na m atụ uche ndị ọrụ ibe m.
That is the key.	Nke ahụ bụ isi.
Your behavior is the same, you know.	Omume gị bụ otu, ị maara.
He had a meeting, he told them.	O nwere nzukọ, ọ gwara ha.
I like doing that.	Ọ masịrị m ime nke ahụ.
I think it could be some kind of bug.	Echere m na ọ nwere ike ịbụ ụdị ahụhụ.
More is still here.	Ihe ndị ọzọ ka dị ebe a.
When he arrived, he was afraid.	Mgbe o rutere, ọ tụrụ egwu.
But not quite.	Ma ọ bụghị nnọọ.
As a result, the city is ideal for travel.	N'ihi ya, obodo ahụ dị mma maka njem njem.
Maybe there is something there, but he does not see it.	Ma eleghị anya, e nwere ihe dị ebe ahụ, ma ọ naghị ahụ ya.
I can't see my feet.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ụkwụ m.
How old are you?	Afọ ole ka ịdị?
We need your strength.	Anyị chọrọ ike gị.
He was amazed.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.
Animals and living beings.	Anụ anụ anụ na agwa ndụ ndụ.
Sometimes, though, there are others.	Otú ọ dị, mgbe ụfọdụ, e nwere ndị ọzọ.
None of them will be in this.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha ga-adị na nke a.

Her children were drowned.	Mmiri riri ụmụ ya.

Maybe we should do less.	Ma eleghị anya, anyị kwesịrị ime ihe nta.

You will not do it.	Ị gaghị eme ya.
But unfortunately we still need you.	Mana ọ dị nwute na anyị ka chọrọ gị.

I was surprised he could speak.	O juru m anya na o nwere ike ikwu okwu.

But she left her feelings behind.	Ma ọ hapụrụ ihe dị ya n’obi.
Tomorrow may not be successful.	Echi nwere ike ọ gaghị aga nke ọma.
It was the first time they had met.	Ọ bụ nke mbụ ha zutere.
Not that he would want it.	Ọ bụghị na ọ ga-achọ ya.
But that is not the point.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị isi ihe.
Why do you not like it?	Gịnị mere na ị naghị amasị ya?
He hoped he did not.	Ọ tụrụ anya na o nweghị.

I am hungry.	Agụụ na-agụ m.
It has never been my favorite.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ihe kacha amasị m.
A little time now.	Obere oge ugbu a.

It can be good but it is not.	Ọ nwere ike ịdị mma ma ọ bụghị.
That is why they are looking for us.	Ọ bụ ya mere ha ji chọọ anyị.
Cost will be a problem.	Ọnụ ego ga-abụ nsogbu.
He saw everything.	Ọ hụrụ ihe niile.
However, that will not be the way others see it.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ agaghị abụ otú ndị ọzọ si hụ ya.
My tears will go away.	Anya mmiri m ga-aga.
All customers are happy.	Ndị ahịa niile nwere obi ụtọ.

It is not an internal task.	Ọ bụghị ọrụ dị n'ime.
Maybe just a book for teachers.	Ma eleghị anya, naanị akwụkwọ maka ndị nkuzi.
It's not like that.	Ọ dịghị ka ya.
He told them about his trip.	Ọ gwara ha banyere njem ya.
That is who you are from today onwards.	Nke ahụ bụ onye ị bụ site ụbọchị taa gaa n'ihu.
It’s better with some things.	Ọ ka mma na ihe ụfọdụ.
He is in the hands of his beautiful son.	Ọ nọ n'aka nwa ya mara mma.
She does not eat at home.	Ọ naghị eri nri n'ụlọ.
Those are two different ideas.	Ndị ahụ bụ echiche abụọ dị iche iche.
It looks like nothing is happening.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ihe na-aga.
He needs the room.	Ọ chọrọ ụlọ ahụ.
Not at that time, he thought.	Ọ bụghị n'oge ahụ, o chere.
This idea is stupid.	Echiche a bụ ihe nzuzu.
And it's really pretty strong.	Ma ọ bụ n'ezie mara mma ike.
That's not my fault.	Nke ahụ abụghị m kpatara.
Some of the team run for the season.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ndị otu na-agba ọsọ maka oge.

You know that the weather is terrible.	Ị maara na ihu igwe dị egwu.

It was still there, a small car would go.	Ọ ka dị ebe ahụ, obere ụgbọala ga-aga.
There is no teaching today.	Enweghị nkuzi taa.
It’s nice and simple.	Ọ dị mma ma dị mfe.
They arrived to find a small house.	Ha rutere ịchọta obere ụlọ.
It will be for tonight.	Ọ ga-abụ maka abalị a.
You are young.	Ị bụ nwata.
You can't go out on your own.	Ị nweghị ike ịpụ ya naanị.
However, it does.	Otú ọ dị, ọ na-eme.
He didn't care what anyone else thought.	Ọ chọghị ịma ihe onye ọ bụla chere banyere ya.
His heart was burning.	Obi ya gbara ọkụ.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Onye ọ bụla maara na ọ ga-anọ ebe ahụ.

His wife was angry.	Iwe were nwunye ya.
Age is not important.	Afọ adịghị mkpa.

Of course, he would do anything to stop it.	N'ezie, ọ ga-eme ihe ọ bụla iji kwụsị ya.
Then the people on the side gave us a nice dinner.	Mgbe ahụ, ndị nọ n'akụkụ nyere anyị nri abalị mara mma.
This is the greatest possible success.	Nke a bụ nnukwu ihe ịga nke ọma nwere ike ime.

We bought the land last year.	Anyị zụtara ala ahụ n'afọ gara aga.
It's very simple.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe.
We do our best.	Anyị na-eme ike anyị niile.
It is like you said.	Ọ dị ka i kwuru.
Nothing serious.	Ọ dịghị mkpa.

It's better to be alone, friend.	Ọ ka mma ịbụ naanị onwe anyị, enyi.
He did not want this time to end.	Ọ chọghị ka oge a kwụsị.

Many cities have schools.	Ọtụtụ obodo nwere ụlọ akwụkwọ.
You can move on now.	Ị nwere ike ịga n'ihu ugbu a.
The service will help you better for your job.	Ọrụ ahụ ga-enyere gị aka nke ọma maka ọrụ gị.
Better early than ever!	Mma n'oge karịa mgbe!
Get to know your customer.	Mara onye ahịa gị.
I think this is different for everyone.	Echere m na nke a dị iche maka onye ọ bụla.
You can not say what they think.	Ị nweghị ike ikwu ihe ha na-eche.
But no one can make it better.	Ma ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ime ka ọ ka mma.
We are not what they do.	Anyị abụghị ihe ha na-eme.
Something terrible happened.	Ihe dị egwu mere.
It was impossible for me to run.	Ọ gaghị ekwe m omume ịgba ọsọ.
Sometimes children do not need any help and sometimes they need big things.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ụmụaka anaghị achọ enyemaka ọ bụla ma mgbe ụfọdụ ha chọrọ nnukwu ihe.
I would not do that at home.	Agaraghị m eme nke ahụ n'ụlọ.
He got his order.	O nwetara iwu ya.
I saw the worst.	Ahụrụ m ndị kacha njọ.
That was not the first thing he told her.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe mbụ ọ gwara ya.
He knows how hungry he is.	Ọ ma agụụ ya.
Very physical game.	Egwuregwu anụ ahụ nke ukwuu.
This is the first problem.	Nke a bụ nsogbu mbụ.
But now we know that the same thing happens to fathers.	Ma ugbu a, anyị ma na ụdị ihe ahụ na-eme ndị nna.
His style of speech is very limited.	Ụdị okwu ya nwere oke oke.
I want to be loved.	Achọrọ m ka a hụ m n'anya.

There is morality and morality.	Enwere omume ọma na omume ọjọọ.

I want to run faster.	Achọrọ m ịgba ọsọ karịa.
I'll just tell him.	Aga m agwa ya naanị.
All around him, people were looking for a small profit.	N'akụkụ ya niile, ndị mmadụ na-achọ obere uru.
Speaking of emotions.	Na-ekwu maka mmetụta.
He went to the window.	Ọ gara na windo.
He eats his food fast.	Ọ na-eri nri ya ngwa ngwa.
Next to it is the other.	N'akụkụ ya bụ nke ọzọ.
He did his job very well and was tough and wise.	O mere nnọọ ọrụ ahụ nke ya ma bụrụ nke siri ike ma mara ihe.
No face was seen.	Ọ dịghị otu ihu lere anyị ụzọ.
In his forty years.	N'ime afọ iri anọ ya.

He declined to say why.	Ọ jụrụ ikwu ihe kpatara ya.
The police acted quickly.	Ndị uwe ojii mere ngwa ngwa.
But now there are service offers.	Ma ugbu a, e nwere onyinye ọrụ.

Most people would be wise to stay home that night.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ nwere ezi uche ịnọ n'ụlọ n'abalị ahụ.
A smile spread across his face.	Ọmụmụ ọnụ ọchị gbasara n'ihu ya.
We will do the same next month.	Anyị ga-eme otu ihe ahụ n'ọnwa na-abịa.
He only needs me one more time.	Ọ chọrọ m naanị otu oge ọzọ.
I love coffee.	Ahụrụ m kọfị n'anya.
Each meal is better than the last.	Nri ọ bụla dị mma karịa nke ikpeazụ.
That was his priority.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe kacha ya mkpa.
A during the feast.	A n'oge oriri.
The passenger's life was difficult.	Ndụ onye njem ahụ siri ike.
Whatever you want.	Ihe ọ bụla ị chọrọ.
His Word speaks the truth.	Okwu ya na-ekwu naanị eziokwu.
He was angry.	Iwe were ya.
They did not see me.	Ha ahụghị m.
My father had a lot of money.	Nna m nwere nnukwu ego.
I do not want to know.	Achọghị m ịma ya.
Everything will be fine.	Ihe niile ga-adị mma.
I have a better room for you.	Enwere m ụlọ ka mma maka gị.
This may be the most important part of my illustration.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ nke kacha mkpa n'ime ihe atụ m.
It is perfect and true.	O zuru oke na ezi-okwu.
I have a picture of him.	Enwere m foto ya.
Working.	Na-arụ ọrụ.
Maybe that’s how he wanted me to feel.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ otú ahụ ka ọ chọrọ ka m nwee mmetụta.
It is drinking water.	Ọ bụ mmiri ọṅụṅụ.
There is reason for optimism.	E nwere ihe mere a ga-eji nwee olileanya.
His power is limitless.	Ike ya enweghị oke.
I still like the sea.	Oke osimiri ka na-amasị m.
I think you will.	Echere m na ị ga-eme ya.
Maybe he should go.	Ma eleghị anya, o kwesịrị ịga.
Now you know where you are.	Ugbu a ị maara ebe ị nọ.
It's really good.	Ọ dị mma n'ezie.
The trip took ten hours.	Njem ahụ were awa iri.
It is three different words.	Ọ bụ okwu atọ dị iche iche.
He was born here, you know.	A mụrụ ya ebe a, ị mara.
Can you tell us about the past?	Ị nwere ike ịgwa anyị gbasara ihe gara aga?
They left several years ago.	Ha hapụrụ ọtụtụ afọ gara aga.
He does not do bad things.	Ọ naghị eme ihe ọjọọ.
But we all know that life is not like that.	Mana anyị niile maara na ndụ adịghị otú ahụ.
These things sometimes happen, it really can't help it.	Ihe ndị a na-eme mgbe ụfọdụ, enweghị ike inyere ya aka n'ezie.
Many other companies offer these at a reasonable price.	Ọtụtụ ụlọ ọrụ ndị ọzọ nyere ndị a ọnụ ahịa ezi uche dị na ya.
So this movie is very funny.	Ya mere ihe nkiri a bụ nnọọ ihe ọchị.
He likes it very much.	Ọ na-amasị ya nke ukwuu.
For some reason, they like to talk to me.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ, ha na-enwe mmasị ịgwa m okwu.
You will love this new fast food place.	Ebe nri ngwa ngwa ọhụrụ a ga-amasị gị.
I wonder if anyone would have seen it burned.	M na-eche ma ọ bụrụ na onye ọ bụla gaara ahụ ya ọkụ.
I'm excited to see something new.	Enwere m obi ụtọ ịhụ ihe ọhụrụ.
He does not listen to them.	Ọ naghị anụ isi ha.
It was then that he said it.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka o kwuru ya.
Then he left the matter.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ hapụrụ okwu ahụ.
If anyone can help me.	Ọ bụrụ na onye ọ bụla nwere ike inyere m aka.
Nothing like mind.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị ka uche.
Of course, it is very simple.	N'ezie, ọ dị nnọọ mfe.
He went when the police arrived.	Ọ gara mgbe ndị uwe ojii rutere.
I am enthusiastic.   	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu.

They did it all.	Ha mere ya ihe niile.
However, that will not happen.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ agaghị eme.
He took the necessary steps to stop them.	O mere ihe ga-adị mkpa iji kwụsị ha.
Your home is probably the most valuable thing you have.	Ma eleghị anya, ụlọ gị bụ ihe kacha ọnụ ahịa ị nwere.
I will not go last.	Agaghị m aga ikpeazụ.
There is only the past.	Enwere naanị ihe gara aga.

Just do it again.	Naanị ime ya ọzọ.
They spend many hours on the road.	Ha nọrọ ọtụtụ awa n’ụzọ.
Thanks for that.	Daalụ maka nke ahụ.
They are not that bad.	Ha adịghị njọ otú ahụ.
You were made for it.	E mere gị maka ya.
He entered the room.	Ọ banyere n'ime ụlọ.
Over the weekend.	N'ime izu ụka.
One who is very important.	Onye dị oke mkpa.
You are right.	I kwuru eziokwu.
We knew we were going to have too much.	Anyị maara na anyị ga-enwe oke oke.
It is not worth it.	Ejighị ya ọnụ ahịa.
I try to make things better.	M na-agbalị ime ka ihe dị mma.
It's not that he doesn't deserve it.	Ọ bụghị na o kwesịghị ya.
That still continues today.	Nke ahụ ọ ka na-aga n'ihu taa.
I have so much energy.	Enwere m ike nke ukwuu.
But nothing else.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
My students love it.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ m hụrụ ya n'anya.
Almost the last of the season really.	Ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ nke ikpeazụ nke oge n'ezie.
My friend ran away.	Enyi m gbara ọsọ.
They will be used as a fire place.	A ga-eji ha eme ihe dị ka ebe ọkụ.
The boat enters the harbor.	Ụgbọ mmiri banyere n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
He spent the winter indoors.	Ọ nọrọ oge oyi niile n'ime ụlọ.
That is what the law says.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe iwu kwuru.
He ate a good breakfast.	O riri ezigbo nri ụtụtụ.

You can see the fight from there.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ọgụ ahụ site n'ebe ahụ.

Not for children.	Ọ bụghị maka ụmụaka.
Everything will be fine.	Ihe niile ga-adị mma.
I do not know them all.	Amaghị m ha niile.
The third pregnancy was temporary.	A tụrụ ime nke atọ ruo nwa oge.
This is just a fun weapon.	Nke a bụ naanị ngwa ọgụ na-atọ ụtọ.
Or at least an idea.	Ma ọ bụ ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ echiche.
There can be no such thing.	Enweghị ike ịbụ ihe dị otú ahụ.
You try not to say cheap and easy things.	Ị na-agbalị ka ị ghara ikwu ihe dị ọnụ ala na ihe dị mfe.
To his right, a huge bridge.	N'akụkụ aka nri ya, akwa mmiri.
Still, it is what it is.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ bụ ihe ọ bụ.
But he was at home.	Ma ọ nọ n'ụlọ.
Rivers should be easy.	Osimiri kwesịrị ịdị mfe.
He is a good student.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwa akwụkwọ.
The plan angered him.	Atụmatụ ahụ were ya iwe.
We are like that.	Anyị dị otú ahụ.
I love your beauty.	Ahụrụ m ịma mma gị.
But none of these things are possible.	Ma nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a agaghị ekwe omume.
He has a house there.	O nwere ụlọ n'ebe ahụ.
Of course, he still had no choice.	O doro anya na o nweghị ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ ọ ga-eme.
They are ideas.	Ha bụ echiche.
It's good that it's bad.	Ọ dị mma na ọ dịghị mma.
So we got someone we got.	Ya mere, anyị nwetara onye anyị nwetara.
Because it is.	N'ihi na ọ bụ.
My father's car was stolen.	E zuru ụgbọ ala nna m.
You like to tell me who said what and when.	Ọ na-amasị gị ịgwa m onye kwuru ihe na mgbe.

It is better to be on time.	Ọ ka mma ịdị na-abịa n'oge.

I have nothing on my head.	Enweghị m ihe ọ bụla n'isi m.
Something very special happened.	Otu ihe yiri ihe pụrụ iche.
He refused to help.	Ọ jụrụ inye aka.
It is a well-known fact.	Ọ bụ ihe a maara nke ọma.
In three respects the situation is different.	N'akụkụ atọ ọnọdụ ahụ dị iche.
There are some good people there.	Enwere ụfọdụ ezigbo mmadụ ebe ahụ.
They are, loved ones, and family.	Ha bụ, ndị hụrụ n'anya, na ezinụlọ.
If they know he is in trouble.	Ọ bụrụ na ha ma na ọ nọ ná nsogbu.
Not our type.	Ọ bụghị ụdị anyị.
And letting people know you are there.	Na ime ka ndị mmadụ mara na ị dị.
Work is coming and going.	Ọrụ na-abịa na-aga.
But I try.	Ma m na-agbalị.
He was at the scene of the accident.	Ọ nọ n'ebe ihe mberede a mere.
It is not easy to do.	Ọ dịghị mfe ime.
Maybe it is.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ.
He walks around the house.	Ọ na-aga n'akụkụ ụlọ.
They like to eat in the village.	Ha na-enwe mmasị iri nri n'ime obodo.
I will do well.	M ga-eme nke ọma.
I fell right away.	M dara ozugbo.
These are happy times.	Oge ndị a bụ oge obi ụtọ.
I speak from the heart.	M na-ekwu site n'obi m.
Then he did something very special.	Mgbe ahụ, o mere ihe pụrụ nnọọ iche.
There is no reason for you to sit still.	Enweghị ihe mere ị ga-eji nọrọ ọdụ.
Because it is important.	N'ihi na ọ dị mkpa.
I feel so good that he knows this.	Enwere m mmetụta nke ukwuu na ọ maara nke a.
I am here.	Anọ m ebe a.
This is not real.	Nke a abụghị ezigbo.
Things work.	Ihe na-arụ ọrụ.
It's small.	Ọ dị obere.
It is the most beautiful house.	Ọ bụ ụlọ kacha mara mma.
Think of something like this too.	Na-eche banyere ihe dị ka nke a kwa.
They were stronger then.	Ha siri ike karịa mgbe ahụ.
Of course we know.	N'ezie, anyị maara.
This is what we do when we do it well.	Nke a bụ ihe anyị na-eme ma anyị na-eme ya nke ọma.
Everything is going on as before.	Ihe niile na-aga n'ihu dị ka ọ dị na mbụ.
He loves her more than anything.	Ọ hụrụ na ọ hụrụ ya n’anya karịa ihe ọ bụla.
That's what he thought.	Ọ bụ ya ka o chere.
We do well.	Anyị na-eme nke ọma.
It will not work.	Ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ.
His actions are my actions.	Omume ya bụ omume m.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
He did not love her.	Ahụghị ya n'anya.
He left me at the dock.	Ọ hapụrụ m n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri.
With me and me.	Mụ na mụ na mụ na mụ.
The city was terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ obodo ahụ.
I like to use houses and trees.	Ọ na-amasị m iji ụlọ na osisi eme ihe.
I can't find one.	Enweghị m ike ịchọta otu.
Maybe it's something else.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
Out of service.	Ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
It's nice to have friends.	Ọ bụ ihe mara mma inwe ndị enyi.
She is fully clothed and light.	O yi uwe zuru oke ma nwee ọkụ.
The rest is just others.	Ihe ndị ọzọ bụ naanị ndị ọzọ.
So it was a little cold.	Ya mere, ọ bụ ntakịrị oyi.
Fear of life is really the fear of emotions.	Egwu nke ndụ bụ n'ezie egwu nke mmetụta uche.
But this does it well.	Ma, nke a na-eme ya nke ọma.
There are times they can.	E nwere oge ha nwere ike.
We are a big company now.	Anyị bụ nnukwu ụlọ ọrụ ugbu a.
I love this idea.	Ahụrụ m echiche a n'anya.
They should not.	Ha ekwesịghị.
Things will happen.	Ihe ga-eme.
I think you are right.	Echere m na ị kwuru eziokwu.
Let’s wait until we make it special.	Ka anyị chere ruo mgbe anyị ga-eme ka ọ pụrụ iche.
That would be impossible.	Nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume.
We found some interesting and interesting things.	Anyị hụrụ ụfọdụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ ma na-atọ ụtọ.
What year is it now?	Kedu afọ ugbu a?
And food.	Na nri.
I could not see for a few minutes.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ụzọ maka nkeji ole na ole.
I can.	Enwere m ike.
It's the only way.	Ọ bụ naanị ụzọ.
It does not look good.	Ọ maghị mma.
No, it is more than that.	Mba, ọ karịrị nke ahụ.
Books are available in every home.	Akwụkwọ dị n'ụlọ ọ bụla.
It helped, for a while.	O nyere aka, ruo oge ụfọdụ.
Sales are running at the event.	Ahịa na-agba na ihe omume.
He cannot use his power.	O nweghị ike iji ike ya mee ihe.
At the same time, the facts are different.	N'otu oge ahụ, eziokwu dị iche iche.
In fact, they both do the same thing.	N'ezie, ha abụọ na-eme otu ihe ahụ.
A small boat docked at the harbor.	Otu obere ụgbọ mmiri kwụsịrị n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
I'm sure we will.	Eji m n'aka na anyị ga-eme ya.
The case is being re-assigned to another judge.	A na-ama ikpe a n'ụlọ ikpe.
But now nothing.	Ma ugbu a, ọ dịghị ihe.
Like this morning.	Dị ka ụtụtụ a.
Everyone knows who you are talking about.	Onye ọ bụla maara onye ị na-ekwu.
We got money from it.	Anyị nwetara ego na ya.
He does not do bad things.	Ọ naghị eme ihe ọjọọ.
I am happy to have it in my life.	Enwere m obi ụtọ inwe ya na ndụ m.
Everything happened so fast.	Ihe niile mere ngwa ngwa.
They have a name.	Ha nwere aha.
But she has emotions.	Ma o nwere mmetụta uche.
Money is here.	Ego ego dị ebe a.
If that is what you want.	Ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ bụ ihe ị chọrọ.
No phone.	Enweghị ekwentị.
We need to face it.	Anyị kwesịrị iche ihu ya.
There are a number of reasons why this should not be the case.	E nwere ọtụtụ ihe mere na o kwesịghị.
No more financial problems.	Enweghị nsogbu ego ọzọ.
They have no interest in such things.	Ha enweghị mmasị n'ihe ndị dị otú ahụ.
They can still do it.	Ha ka nwere ike ime ya.
Just about the girl.	Naanị banyere nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
The mouse is very hungry.	Oke nwere oke agụụ.
I'm glad you liked the book.	Obi dị m ụtọ na akwụkwọ ahụ masịrị gị.

I liked the word.	Okwu ahụ masịrị m.
Your idea is just your limit.	Echiche gị bụ naanị oke gị.
So young.	Ya mere nwata.
If they are here.	Ọ bụrụ na ha nọ ebe a.
Can you tell me.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa m.
It has an easy way.	O nwere ụzọ dị mfe.
It can be done in a very high way.	Enwere ike ime ihe n'ụzọ dị oke elu.
I feel so much better.	Enwere m mmetụta nke ukwuu.
I think that made a difference in the game.	Echere m na nke ahụ mere ihe dị iche na egwuregwu ahụ.
I love you and everyone.	Ahụrụ m gị na mmadụ niile n'anya.
But that is unlikely to happen.	Ma o yikarịrị ka nke ahụ agaghị eme.
My wife is pregnant.	Nwunye di m di ime.
This has been a problem for many years.	Nke a bụ nsogbu kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
Talk to your mother.	Gwa nne gị okwu.
This is very good.	Nke a dị ezigbo mma.
We kept waiting.	Anyị gara n'ihu na-eche.
Everyone here has something.	Onye ọ bụla nọ ebe a nwere ihe.
Or food.	Ma ọ bụ nri.
We thought that might not be good.	Anyị chere na nke ahụ nwere ike ọ gaghị adị mma.
The environment needs one.	Gburugburu kwesịrị otu onye.
She did all she could to help him.	O mere ihe niile o nwere ike ime iji nyere ya aka.
They should do everything within four days.	Ha kwesịrị ime ihe niile n'ime ụbọchị anọ.
They both agreed.	Ha abụọ kwere isi.
The story finally came true.	Akụkọ ahụ mechara bụrụ eziokwu.
Of course different styles.	N'ezie ụdị dị iche iche.
We did not see any children there.	Anyị ahụghị ụmụaka mgbe ebe ahụ.
I did not see him.	Ahụghị m ya.
The speaker is not really there.	Nwoke ahụ na-ekwu okwu anọghị ebe ahụ n'ezie.
It exists now.	Ọ dị adị ugbu a.
Then he knew.	Mgbe ahụ ọ maara.
But it is much more than that.	Ma ọ karịrị nnọọ nke ahụ.
You can visit the city from here.	Ị nwere ike ịga obodo site ebe a.
Give us a better chance.	Nye anyị ohere ka mma.
People come here because of books.	Ndị mmadụ na-abịa ebe a n'ihi akwụkwọ.

I don't think it's his intention.	Echeghị m na ọ bụ ihe dị ya n'obi.

You heard it.	Ị nụrụ ya.

You must do what your heart desires.	Ị ga-eme ihe obi gị chọrọ ime.

I like the language.	Enwere m mmasị na asụsụ ahụ.
But they do nothing for us.	Ma ha anaghị eme anyị ihe ọ bụla.
While they are here, they are sensible.	N'oge ha nọ ebe a, ha nwere ezi uche.
I mean, it’s going to be the capital.	M na-ekwu, ọ ga-abụ isi obodo.
So you eat what you can, when you can.	Ya mere, ị na-eri ihe ị nwere ike, mgbe ị nwere ike.
That is really hard.	Nke ahụ siri ike n'ezie.
Lots of hot water.	Ọtụtụ mmiri ọkụ.
It is not an easy task.	Ọ bụghị ọrụ dị mfe.
I want to get out of court.	Achọrọ m ịpụ n'ụlọ ikpe.
No, not surprisingly.	Mba, ọ bụghị anya.
He will not see me.	Ọ gaghị ahụ anya m.
Why did the messenger become angry at the situation?	Gịnị mere onye ozi ahụ ji were iwe banyere ọnọdụ ahụ?
Police are everywhere.	Ndị uwe ojii nọ ebe niile.
I enjoy this chapter.	Isi a na-atọ m ụtọ.
They all hate him.	Ha niile kpọrọ ya asị.
The two face each other.	Ha abụọ chere ibe ha ihu.
Along the way, it felt like home.	N'akụkụ ahụ, ọ dị ya ka ụlọ.
He never thought of it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe o chere ya.
Everyone has a past.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ihe gara aga.
That is what dogs do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe nkịta na-eme.
I was the first customer at the store that day.	Abụ m onye ahịa mbụ na ụlọ ahịa ahụ ụbọchị ahụ.
I suggest it can be great.	M na-atụ aro na ọ nwere ike ịbụ nke ukwuu.
Now is not the time to meditate;	Ugbu a abụghị oge echiche ọjọọ.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
But they are not telling him.	Ma ha anaghị agwa ya.
The cause of the problem is unknown.	A maghị ihe kpatara nsogbu ahụ.
Her favorite color is green.	Agba kacha amasị ya bụ akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ.
I can love your mother.	Enwere m ike ịhụ nne gị n'anya gị.
It is a big problem.	Ọ bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
There is no anger before him.	Iwe adịghị n'ihu ya.
You think something else.	Ị na-eche ihe ọzọ.
It is his job, not mine.	Ọ bụ ọrụ ya, ọ bụghị nke m.
No difference is necessary.	Ihe dị iche adịghị mkpa.
I was not three years old at the time.	Adịghị m afọ atọ n’oge ahụ.
Let him speak to me.	Ka ọ gwa m okwu.
There is a good second photo here.	Enwere ezigbo foto nke abụọ ebe a.
He has traveled to many different countries.	Ọ gara ọtụtụ mba dị iche iche.
But some beautiful things.	Ma ụfọdụ ihe mara ezigbo mma.
But this is now being questioned.	Mana nke a na-enwe obi abụọ ugbu a.
Both will be fine.	Ha abụọ ga-adị mma.
I want to use my awesome story.	Achọrọ m iji akụkọ m dị egwu masịrị m.
That, to me, is awesome.	Nke ahụ, nye m, dị oke egwu.
It will never be.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-enwe.
But then it spread.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ gbasara.
But the problem continues.	Ma nsogbu ahụ gara n'ihu.
He put his other hand over his mouth.	O tinyere aka ya nke ọzọ n'ọnụ ya.
Great for me.	Oke maka m.
He made himself.	O mere onwe ya.
No one spoke to him like that.	Ọ dịghị onye gwara ya okwu otú ahụ.
They love each other very much.	Ha hụrụ ibe ha n’anya nke ukwuu.
It’s an old school but it works.	Ọ bụ ụlọ akwụkwọ ochie mana ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
He goes to life.	Ọ na-aga ndụ.
The beautiful head got the girl.	Onye isi mara mma nwetara nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
The rains came early that year.	Mmiri bịara n'isi afọ ahụ.
I am good at this.	Adị m mma na nke a.
It makes you aware.	Ọ na-eme ka ị mara.
There is something very living about it.	Ọ dị ihe dị nnọọ ndụ banyere ya.
Which, of course, we are.	Nke, anyị bụ.
Three patients died.	Ndị ọrịa atọ nwụrụ.
Almost no one is ready for that.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ na ọ nweghị onye dị njikere maka nke ahụ.
One third heard his name.	Otu ụzọ n'ụzọ atọ nụrụ aha ya.
The woman lives alone.	Nwanyị ahụ bi naanị ya.
This type of food is awesome.	Ụdị nri a dị egwu.
Others go back for more.	Ndị ọzọ na-aga azụ maka ihe ndị ọzọ.
That it is fun to play is just money.	Na ọ na-atọ ụtọ igwu egwu bụ naanị ego.
No one thought about it.	Ọ dịghị onye chere banyere ya.
I could see him immediately from his shirt.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ya ozugbo site na uwe elu ya.
That would be impossible.	Nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume n'ezie.
He stopped ten good feet.	Ọ kwụsịrị ezigbo ụkwụ iri.
You can not do it now.	Ị nweghị ike ime ya ugbu a.
Enjoy the fun, the fun.	Ụtọ na-atọ ụtọ, na-atọ ụtọ.
Of course, only the patient judges nationally.	N'ezie, naanị onye ọrịa ikpe mba.
I think maybe that is what is happening to me.	Echere m ma eleghị anya ọ bụ ihe na-eme m.
They made his friends.	Ha mere ndị enyi ya.
But you do not know how to do it.	Ma ị maghị otú ị ga-esi mee ya.
I like the way it works.	Otú o si arụ ọrụ masịrị m.
I never understood it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m ghọtara ya.
Everything is dead.	Ihe niile bụ ihe nwụrụ anwụ.
I want to make you happy.	Achọrọ m ime ka ị nwee obi ụtọ.
His face was worse than his own.	Ihu ya dị njọ karịa nke ya.
These machines are very good.	Igwe ndị a dị oke mma.
Of course, most people do not.	N'ezie, ọtụtụ ndị anaghị eme ya.
There is still much work to be done.	Ọtụtụ ọrụ anyị ka chọrọ ime.
We love it.	Anyị hụrụ ya n'anya.
Her body is weak.	Ahụ ya adịghị ike.
My head is like a cloud.	Isi m dị ka igwe ojii.
And that it can be.	Na na ọ nwere ike ịbụ.
I think they make sense.	Echere m na ha na-enwe mmetụta.
Someone stole my purse.	Ọ nwere onye zuru obere akpa m.
The old man was reading a newspaper.	Nwoke ahụ bụ́ enyi ochie ahụ nọ na-agụ akwụkwọ akụkọ.
Makes me feel better in court, of course.	Na-eme ka ahụ dị m mma n'ụlọ ikpe, n'ezie.
They did not see me.	Ha ahụghị anya m.
That is not the case.	Nke ahụ abụghị ikpe.
That's not bad.	Nke ahụ adịghị njọ.
Some are small.	Ụfọdụ dị obere.
But there is more.	Ma enwere ihe ọzọ.
In a short time, he gave himself hope.	Obere oge, o kwere onwe ya inwe olileanya.
We do not know how many couples there are.	Anyị agaghị ama ole di na nwunye dị.
Man near the door of the room.	Nwoke nso n'ọnụ ụzọ ọnụ ụlọ.
But it is.	Mana ọ bụ ya.
But in this it is really difficult.	Ma na nke a ọ bụ n'ezie ike.
But it is not doing well.	Mana ọ naghị eme nke ọma.
When they called him, he came.	Mgbe ha kpọrọ ya, ọ bịara.
I do not want to see that again.	Achọghị m ịhụ ihe ahụ ọzọ.
Love to do things.	Na-enwe mmasị ime ihe.
Pretty much, he thought.	Ihe mara mma, o chere.
The problem is that there are so many.	Nsogbu bụ na ọ dị ọtụtụ.
Not that we do that.	Ọ bụghị na anyị na-eme nke ahụ.
A year earlier.	Otu afọ tupu mgbe ahụ.
For many years now.	Ruo ọtụtụ afọ ugbu a.
It's not a way out, believe me.	Ọ bụghị ụzọ isi pụọ kwere m.
Some on each side have emotional feelings.	Ụfọdụ n'akụkụ nke ọ bụla nwere mmetụta mmetụta uche.
The plan failed.	Atụmatụ ahụ adịghị aga nke ọma.
He didn't want to think about it, he was clear.	Ọ chọghị iche echiche banyere ya, o doro ya anya.
You came to take action.	Ị bịara mee ihe.
Stupid things are happening here.	Ihe nzuzu na-eme ebe a.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe gbasara oge.
Second, this test is for a short time.	Nke abụọ, ule a bụ maka obere oge.
Temperatures were measured daily.	A tụrụ okpomọkụ kwa ụbọchị.
He has been here many times.	Ọ gara ebe a ọtụtụ oge.
We will never be.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị ga-abụ.
But again.	Ma ọzọ.
I am now for myself.	Anọ m ugbu a maka onwe m.
I doubt if a lot will be done.	Enwere m obi abụọ ma a ga-eme ọtụtụ ihe.
So high up.	Ya mere elu elu.
I think it has a negative and positive effect.	Echere m na ọ nwere mmetụta ọjọọ na nke dị mma.
Is this.	Nke a bụ.
There is no price.	Ọ dịghị ọnụ.
I am grateful for what you did there.	Obi dị m ụtọ maka ihe ị mere ebe ahụ.
Or plenty of water.	Ma ọ bụ ọtụtụ mmiri.
Not that he expected anything.	Ọ bụghị na ọ tụrụ anya ihe ọ bụla.
Police were at his office yesterday.	Ndị uwe ojii nọ n'ụlọ ọrụ ya ụnyahụ.
I will not be here first.	Agaghị m anọ ebe a mbụ.
Helpful questions.	Ajụjụ enyemaka enyemaka.

Or her son.	Ma ọ bụ nwa ya nwoke.
Without a father, a mother does not work.	Enweghị nna, nne adịghị arụ ọrụ.
It's really easy.	Ọ dị mfe n'ezie.
I like that.	Enwere m mmasị na nke ahụ.
He left an hour.	Ọ hapụrụ otu awa.
But he will not do it.	Ma ọ gaghị eme ya.
They hate all newspapers.	Ha kpọrọ akwụkwọ akụkọ niile asị.
We want to make sure this never happens again.	Anyị chọrọ ịhụ na nke a agaghị eme ọzọ.
We may not know their names.	Anyị nwere ike ọ gaghị ama aha ha.
They do not expect everyone to get the same thing.	Ha anaghị atụ anya ka onye ọ bụla nweta otu ihe ahụ.
Tell the tree.	Gwa osisi.
In perfect color.	Na agba zuru oke.
Do it that way.	Mee ya otú ahụ.
He is celebrating his birthday.	Ọ na-eme oriri na nkwa ụbọchị ọmụmụ ya.
Of course it seems like a big task is easy.	N'ezie ọ dị ka nnukwu ọrụ dị mfe.
The players have their chance this year.	Ndị egwuregwu ahụ nwere ohere ha n'afọ a.
People are going to leave.	Ndị mmadụ na-aga ịpụ.
One day, they will be able to kick the ball.	Otu ụbọchị, ha ga-enwe ike ịgba bọọlụ ahụ.
Her children know her.	Ụmụ ya maara ya.
She watched him eat.	O lere ya anya ka ọ na-eri nri.
They were put together in a new house.	E tinyere ha ọnụ n'ụlọ ọhụrụ.
This, of course, will not happen.	Nke a, n'ezie, agaghị eme.
I do not think many know.	Echeghị m na ọtụtụ ndị maara.
We can talk.	Anyị nwere ike ikwu okwu.
He may have been an angel.	O nwere ike ịbụ mmụọ ozi.
I have time.	Enwere m oge.
I can not do it.	Enweghị m ike ime ya.
It's fun.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
For their families.	Maka ezinụlọ ha.
Work works here.	Ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ ebe a.
So that doesn’t work.	Ya mere nke ahụ anaghị arụ ọrụ.
Myself.	N'onwe m.
But let's not talk about that.	Ma ka anyị ghara ikwu banyere nke ahụ.
We are very impressed.	Ọ masịrị anyị nke ukwuu.
They don't seem to be going anywhere.	Ọ dị ka ha agaghị ebe ọ bụla.
Being free helped.	Inwe onwe ya nyere aka.
The reaction is so fast that it is almost invisible.	Omume ahụ dị ngwa ngwa na ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ihe a na-adịghị ahụ anya.
It's not fair.	Ọ dịghị mma.
That did not happen at this time.	Nke ahụ emeghị n'oge a.
Every day, we still need each other.	Kwa ụbọchị, anyị ka chọrọ ibe anyị.
If you can help that would be great.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike inye aka nke ahụ ga-adị mma.
John did not like the new plan.	Atụmatụ ọhụrụ ahụ enweghị mmasị John.
But all the people who met him liked him.	Ma ndị niile zutere ya masịrị ya.
An old story.	Otu akụkọ ochie.
She is not a happy wife.	Ọ bụghị nwunye obi ụtọ.
But for me, this movie is really good.	Ma nye m, ihe nkiri a mara ezigbo mma.
I have to live in some way.	M ga-adị ndụ n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
Several years ago.	Ọtụtụ afọ gara aga.
I have no problem talking about it.	Enweghị m nsogbu ikwu maka ya.
It is very difficult.	O siri ezigbo ike.
With others coming, no doubt.	Na ndị ọzọ na-abịa, obi abụọ adịghị ya.
He was amazed at how he felt.	O juru ya anya otú obi dị ya.
I'm not cruel.	Adịghị m obi ọjọọ.
Should have.	Kwesịrị inwe.
We thought maybe some kind of family talk came along.	Anyị chere ma eleghị anya, ụfọdụ ụdị okwu ezinụlọ bịara.
Everything is important.	Ihe ọ bụla dị mkpa.
You can get a view of the land here.	Ị nwere ike nweta echiche nke ala ebe a.
The first prisoner goes on.	Onye mkpọrọ mbụ na-aga n'ihu.
The first thing he said was that she was a strong girl.	Okwu mbụ o kwuru bụ na ọ bụ nwa agbọghọ siri ike.
They are more likely to go.	O yikarịrị ka ha ga-aga.
Finding ourselves in something can be a thing.	Ịhụ onwe anyị na ihe nwere ike ịbụ ihe.
It is very cruel.	Ọ bụ nnọọ obi ọjọọ.
Therefore, such things happened more often than one might have imagined.	Ya mere, ihe ndị dị otú ahụ mere ugboro ugboro karịa otu onye nwere ike iche.
But sometimes fear can.	Ma mgbe ụfọdụ, mmetụta ụjọ nwere ike ịdị.
I don't care about that.	Achọghị m ịma maka nke ahụ.
It's very beautiful, but really very beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu, mana n'ezie mara mma nke ukwuu.
Suddenly, this seemed perfect.	Na mberede, nke a yiri ihe zuru oke.
Again, not happy about it.	Ọzọ, enweghị obi ụtọ maka ya.
But he knew it.	Ma ọ maara ya.
The holiday season made him eat a good lunch.	Oge ezumike ahụ mere ka o rie nri ehihie dị mma.
Maybe that will improve his hearing.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ ga-eme ka ntị ya ka mma.
He does not miss his family.	Ọ naghị atụ uche ezinụlọ ya.
Feel there.	Mmetụta ebe ahụ.
But they keep coming.	Ma ha na-aga n'ihu na-abịa.
Just an hour.	Naanị otu awa.
You are not your cousin.	Ị bụghị nwa nna gị.
I want it to be simple, about it.	Achọrọ m ka ọ dị mfe, gbasara ya.
That was just a journey.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ njem.
He liked it, of course.	Ọ masịrị ya, n'ezie.
These last two methods work.	Ụzọ abụọ a nke ikpeazụ na-arụ ọrụ.
Keep running well.	Na-aga n'ihu na-agba ọsọ nke ọma.
I do not know anything.	Amaghị m ihe ọ bụla.
Here it is.	Nke a bụ ya.
But it's something new.	Ma ọ bụ ihe ọhụrụ.
Seeing my company in a national newspaper was so exciting.	Ịhụ ụlọ ọrụ m na akwụkwọ akụkọ nke mba dị ezigbo ụtọ.
The screams of laughter fell.	Mkpu nke ọchị dara.
A few trees.	Osisi ole na ole.
Things stopped for me.	Ihe kwụsịrị m.
He is well-known for his extraordinary conduct.	A ma ya ama maka omume ya na-enweghị atụ.
He has not been happy since his wife died.	Obi adịghị ya ụtọ kemgbe nwunye ya nwụrụ.
It is what they do from now on that matters.	Ọ bụ ihe ha na-eme site ugbu a ka ọ dị mkpa.
They really are.	Ha bụ n'ezie.
The beauty is like a toy.	Mma ahụ dị ka ihe egwuregwu ụmụaka.
They want their players one way or another.	Ha chọrọ ndị egwuregwu ha otu ụzọ.
This is not seen.	A naghị ahụ nke a.
Order whatever you want.	Nye iwu ihe ọ bụla ị chọrọ.
However, this place is not ideal.	Otú ọ dị, ebe a adịghị mma.
It was a real challenge.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ihe ịma aka.
The event lasted several days.	Ihe omume ahụ mere ọtụtụ ụbọchị.
When you arrive by car, stay there.	Mgbe ị rutere ụgbọ ala, nọrọ ebe ahụ.
My car is not working properly.	Ụgbọ ala m anaghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
I will never do that again.	Agaghị m eme nke ahụ ọzọ.
They will help make sure your clothes look good.	Ha ga-enyere aka hụ na uwe gị nwere ezigbo mma.
If you do that, something new will happen.	Ọ bụrụ na i mee nke ahụ, ihe ọhụrụ ga-eme.
I miss the game.	A na m atụ uche egwuregwu ahụ.
You need a new way.	Ị chọrọ ụzọ ọhụrụ.
But as history unfolds, it is not history for us.	Ma ka akụkọ ihe mere eme na-agba ọsọ, ọ bụghị akụkọ ihe mere eme nye anyị.
About money.	Banyere ego.
Not so.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
Of course it is very different.	N'ezie ọ bụ nnọọ iche.
The car is very brand new.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ dị ezigbo ọhụrụ.
The first is a challenge.	Nke mbụ bụ ihe ịma aka.
i am beautiful	m mara mma.
Life in this city is hard.	Ndụ obodo a siri ike.
Are you afraid of what might happen?	Ị na-atụ egwu ihe nwere ike ime?
Because of this, they can be very helpful.	N'ihi nke a, ha nwere ike inye aka nke ukwuu.
In practice, it never happened.	Na omume, ọ dịghị mgbe mere.
Undoubtedly this is true for both men and women.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na nke a bụ eziokwu maka ma ndị nwoke ma ndị nwanyị.
This is not good, but it is better.	Nke a adịghị mma, mana ọ ka mma.
He was like an invisible spirit.	Ọ dị ka mmụọ a na-adịghị ahụ anya.
That seems difficult.	Nke ahụ yiri ihe siri ike.
I have his rules.	Enwere m iwu ya.
In some ways, she feels like her brother.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ọ dị ya ka nwanne ya nwoke.
Both looked at their handiwork.	Otu abụọ ahụ lere anya n'ọrụ aka ha.
Still, there is still a way to go.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, a ka nwere ụzọ ị ga-esi gaa.
It is a city.	Ọ bụ obodo.
It can happen any year.	Ọ nwere ike ime n'afọ ọ bụla.
Nice to see you.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ gị.
He wants to be here.	Ọ chọrọ ịnọ ebe a.
I was just scared.	Naanị ụjọ tụrụ m.
I was 20 years old.	A gbara m afọ iri abụọ.
They do their best.	Ha na-eme ike ha niile.
I can see him there to this day.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ya ebe ahụ ruo taa.
I think it was at the door of his room.	Echere m na ọ bụ n'ọnụ ụzọ ụlọ ya.
That is very important for us.	Nke ahụ dị anyị ezigbo mkpa.
I am sure many people read his newspaper.	O doro m anya na ọtụtụ ndị na-agụ akwụkwọ akụkọ ya.
Do your job or quit.	Mee ọrụ gị ma ọ bụ kwụsị.
I am 21 years old now.	Adị m iri abụọ na otu ugbu a.
Thanks for you !!.	Daalụ maka gị!!.
First, a.	Nke mbụ, a.
First and only.	Nke mbụ na naanị.
There is only one of you.	Enwere naanị otu onye n'ime unu.
It will not be good.	Ọ gaghị adị mma.

He took a knife in the flesh.	O were mma mma n'ime anụ.
He has doubts about you.	O nwere obi abụọ banyere gị.
But perfect beauty.	Ma mma zuru oke.
All night, of course.	Abalị niile, n'ezie.
So just in time.	Ya mere, naanị n'oge.
Our clothes are wet.	Uwe anyị dị mmiri.
However, there are many important challenges.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ọtụtụ ihe ịma aka dị mkpa.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
The word is true.	Okwu ahụ bụ eziokwu.
They did not see the whole point.	Ha ahụghị isi ihe ya niile.
But everything will be fine.	Ma ihe niile ga-adị mma.
I like the cold weather.	ihu igwe jụrụ oyi masịrị m.
The main idea is this.	Isi echiche bụ nke a.
But some members do things to help more than others.	Mana ụfọdụ ndị otu na-eme ihe iji nyere aka karịa ndị ọzọ.
And get out of the house.	Na pụọ ​​na ụlọ.
Fear can do that.	Ụjọ nwere ike ime nke ahụ.
He felt helpless.	O nwere mmetụta nke enweghị enyemaka.
The operator handed the passenger several bills.	Onye ọrụ ahụ nyere onye njem ahụ ọtụtụ akwụkwọ ego.
You deserve to think.	Ọ kwesịrị ka ị na-eche.
Events happen every day.	Ihe omume na-eme kwa ụbọchị.
He is the highest of all.	Ọ bụ ya kacha elu n'ụzọ niile.
He should not go too far.	O kwesịghị ịga ebe dị anya.
The challenge is that we are very different.	Ihe ịma aka bụ na anyị dị nnọọ iche.
Everyone was told to leave.	A gwara ndị niile nọ ebe ahụ ka ha pụọ.
We argue all the time.	Anyị na-arụ ụka mgbe niile.
It came pretty close next time.	Ọ bịara mara mma nso oge ọzọ.
Individual events can be long-lasting.	Ihe ndị dị n'otu n'otu nwere ike ịbụ ogologo oge aka ike.
Nothing is happening to you.	Ọ dịghị ihe na-eme gị.
It runs!	Ọ na-agba!
We did it first.	Anyị mere ya mbụ.
It's like a new machine.	Ọ dị ka igwe ọhụrụ.
I think I need to talk about this.	M chere na ọ dị m mkpa ikwu ihe banyere nke a.
Some money is better than no money at all.	Ụfọdụ ego dị mma karịa enweghị ego.
Not a beautiful photo.	Ọ bụghị foto mara mma.
Therefore, they desperately need money right away.	N'ihi ya, ego ozugbo dị ha ezigbo mkpa.
We talked about this.	Anyị kwuru banyere nke a.
I am still trying to do a few things.	M ka na-agbalị ime ihe ole na ole.
It's good that they both love him.	Ọ dị mma na ha abụọ hụrụ ya n'anya.
It is two people.	Ọ bụ mmadụ abụọ.
I read those letters with her.	Mụ na ya na-agụ akwụkwọ ozi ndị ahụ.
They were on their way.	Ha nọ na-aga.
I plan for my life.	M na-eme atụmatụ maka ndụ m.
The old house is beautiful.	Ụlọ ochie ahụ mara mma.
No side effects were observed in our patients.	Enweghị mmetụta ọ bụla ahụrụ na ndị ọrịa anyị.
As of now, here you are.	Dị ka ugbu a, ebe a na gị.
One spoke of both.	Otu onye kwuru maka ha abụọ.
Then it was his turn.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ bụ oge ya.
I only like food.	Naanị nri na-atọ m ụtọ.
We have so much there now.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ ihe n'ebe ugbu a.
Hard to believe.	O siri ike ikweta.
It's not just men.	Ọ bụghị naanị ụmụ nwoke.
The woman died over the weekend.	Nwanyị ahụ nwụrụ n'ime izu ụka.
There is no easy way.	Enweghị ụzọ dị mfe.
And that says something.	Na nke ahụ na-ekwu ihe.
I need you, he thought.	Achọrọ m gị, ọ chere na ya.
The car is good.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ dị mma.
You told me you did.	Ị gwara m na i mere.
I was only one night there.	Anọ m ebe ahụ naanị otu abalị.
Because this is where they belong.	N'ihi na nke a bụ ebe ha nwere.
But there is no way to do that.	Mana ọ nweghị ụzọ isi mee nke ahụ n'ezie.
More than any other time of the day.	Karịa oge ọ bụla ọzọ nke ụbọchị.
He was angry in front of her.	O nwere iwe n'ihu ya.
Here is his story.	Nke a bụ akụkọ ya.
He is a qualified doctor.	Ọ bụ dọkịta nwere ikike.
That is what we want.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị chọrọ.
I play to make them happy.	M na-egwu egwu iji mee ha obi ụtọ.
That should be fine.	Nke ahụ kwesịrị ịdị mma.
Simple and good.	Dị mfe ma dị mma.
Today, not tomorrow.	Taa, ọ bụghị echi.
I'm not feeling well.	Adịghị m mma nke ukwuu.
All of this appealed to all of us.	Ihe niile a na-ekwu, ọ masịrị anyị niile.
I am grateful for them.	Obi dị m ụtọ maka ha.
It will help you when you are weak.	Ọ ga-enyere gị aka mgbe ike mmadụ adịghị ike.
She is another woman.	Ọ bụ nwanyị ọzọ.
He told us over and over again.	Ọ gwara anyị ugboro ugboro.
I wondered why our heads did not tell us this.	M nọ na-eche ihe mere isi anyị anaghị agwa anyị ihe a.
This is simple.	Nke a dị mfe.
Most of the guests.	Ọtụtụ n’ime ndị bịara nọrọ.
That is not my point.	Nke ahụ abụghị isi okwu m.
So it is with them.	Otú ahụ ka ha nwere.
It is the same book.	Ọ bụ otu akwụkwọ.
Sometimes that works.	Mgbe ụfọdụ nke ahụ na-arụ ọrụ.
I still can't believe it.	Ọ ka anaghị ekwe m.
As he thinks.	Ka ọ na-eche.
No, no, no sleep.	Mba, mba, enweghị ụra.
He had to do so many years ago.	O kwesịrị ime ya ọtụtụ afọ gara aga.
They are the law.	Ha bụ iwu.

This made it less expensive and faster.	Nke a mere ka ọ ghara ịdị ọnụ na ngwa ngwa.
It is your time now.	Ọ bụ oge gị ugbu a.
It is the best way to do it.	Ọ bụ ụzọ kacha mma isi mee ya.
He did not really care.	Ọ dịghị ya mkpa n'ezie.
Basically, we were in the same boat for the same route.	N'ụzọ bụ isi, anyị nọ n'otu ụgbọ mmiri maka otu ụzọ.
He obviously made matters worse.	O doro anya na o mere ka ihe ka njọ.
I love you both.	Ahụrụ m unu abụọ n'anya.

And you have the boats themselves.	Na ị nwere ụgbọ mmiri n'onwe ha.
She is sad.	Obi adịghị ya mma.
He will do it.	Ọ ga-eme ya.
He did well.	O mere ezi.
We have a big issue.	Anyị nwere nnukwu okwu.
This is for doing something different.	Nke a bụ maka ime ihe dị iche.
In some ways, this is nothing new.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, nke a abụghị ihe ọhụrụ.
You want to give it to me, great.	Ị chọrọ inye m ya, nnukwu.
I think this is where it should be.	Echere m na ọ bụ ebe a ka o kwesịrị ịdị.
It applies to me.	Ọ gbasara m.
I have a client who has the same problem.	Enwere m onye ahịa nwere otu nsogbu ahụ.
She does not care what her mother says.	Ọ chọghị ịma ihe nne ya kwuru.
Like a baby.	Dị ka nwa ọhụrụ.
Obviously they come from money.	O doro anya na ha si ego.
His mother watched as they entered.	Nne ya lere anya mgbe ha banyere.
It’s not around boys can be her son.	Ọ bụghị gburugburu ụmụ nwoke nwere ike ịbụ nwa ya nwoke.
It was an awesome movie.	Ọ bụ ihe nkiri dị egwu.
The soil is fertile, but the weather is bad.	Ala na-eme nri, ma ihu igwe dị njọ.
Two eyes are better than one.	Anya abụọ dị mma karịa otu.
In this game you have the ability to have some kind of story in it.	Na egwuregwu a nwere ikike inwe ụdị akụkọ na ya.
I have no brother.	Enweghị m nwanne.
Everyone goes fast.	Onye ọ bụla na-aga ngwa ngwa.
It's tough.	O siri ike.
His story is true.	Akụkọ ya nwere eziokwu.
I want to say a little why we are here today.	Achọrọ m ikwu ntakịrị ihe kpatara anyị ji nọrọ ebe a taa.
Serious action is required.	Ọ dị mkpa ka e mee ihe siri ike.
I think this is true.	Echere m na nke a bụ eziokwu.
The city has no land.	Obodo ahụ enweghị ala.
Obviously this is a long process.	O doro anya na nke a bụ ihe dị ogologo oge.
That will not happen until next year.	Nke ahụ agaghị eme ruo n'afọ ọzọ.
He did not know whether the windows were high or low.	Ọ maghị ma windo elu ma ọ bụ ala.
This is just a movie.	Nke a bụ naanị ihe nkiri.

Of course you can.	N'ezie ị nwere ike.
I feel like I can't go on with the game.	Ọ dị m ka enweghị m ike ịga n'ihu egwuregwu ahụ.
He looked back.	O lere anya azụ.
His wife would be unhappy.	Obi agaghị adị nwunye ya ụtọ.
It makes it less of a problem.	Ọ na-eme ka ọ ghara inwe nsogbu.
He is a good friend.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi.
It can be sincere, from the heart.	O nwere ike ịbụ ezi obi, si n'obi.
From the head.	Site na isi.

Let me see those songs again.	Ka m hụ egwu ndị ahụ ọzọ.
This city is known as a friend.	A maara obodo a dị ka enyi enyi.
And, like our house, there is nothing friendly.	Na, dị ka ụlọ anyị, ọ dịghị ihe enyi.
My head feels full.	Isi m nwere mmetụta zuru oke.
That will do well.	Nke ahụ ga-eme nke ọma.
Fast and for some, that’s the way to do it.	Ngwa ngwa na ụfọdụ, nke ahụ bụ ụzọ ime ya.
It works.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
I don't like this.	Ihe a adịghị m mma.
They arrived last night.	Ha rutere n'ime abalị ụnyaahụ.
That is what you have to do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ị ga-eme.
He told me once.	O kwuru m otu oge.
I don't like the job very much.	Achọghị m ọrụ ahụ nke ukwuu.
The song is long.	Abụ ahụ dị ogologo ogologo.
He was scared.	Ọ tụrụ egwu.
Then it will not.	Mgbe ahụ ọ gaghị.
Thank goodness!	Daalụ ịdị mma!
He went to work fast.	Ọ gara ọrụ ngwa ngwa.
You said that.	I kwuru otu a.
However, they tried.	Otú ọ dị, ha gbalịrị.

He heard it well.	Ọ nụrụ ya nke ọma.
It’s not what I do.	Ọ bụghị ihe m na-eme.
They are really in front of me.	Ha nọ n'ihu m n'ezie.
They looked the same to me.	Ha lere m anya otu ihe ahụ.
It is not.	Ọ bụghị.
They are not great.	Ha adịghị ukwuu.
They are all very beautiful.	Ha niile mara mma nke ukwuu.
It was a nice room.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ọnụ ụlọ.
Everyone loves the baby.	Onye ọ bụla hụrụ nwa ahụ.
You can take any you want.	Ị nwere ike were nke ọ bụla ịchọrọ.
Everything is fine with him.	Ihe niile dị ya mma.
Coffee shops are crowded.	Ụlọ ahịa kọfị juru ebe niile.
But he will not do it.	Ma ọ gaghị eme ya.
Not a bad game for any of you.	Ọ bụghị egwuregwu ọjọọ maka onye ọ bụla n'ime unu.
But if you tell anyone, you know what will happen.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ị gwa onye ọ bụla, ị maara ihe ga-eme.
That is our plan.	Nke ahụ bụ atụmatụ anyị.
One day, he will travel farther from the countryside.	Otu ụbọchị, ọ ga-esi n’ime ime obodo gaa ebe dị anya.
His evil deeds.	Ihe omume ọjọọ ya.
He was angry.	Iwe juru ya.
It’s more, you know.	Ọ ka ukwuu, ị mara.
The leaves are green.	Akwụkwọ ndị ahụ bụ akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ.
He promised not to tell the children.	O kwere nkwa na ya agaghị agwa ụmụaka ahụ.
They are happy for him as a human being.	Ha nwere obi ụtọ maka ya dị ka mmadụ.
Always do your best.	Na-eme ike gị mgbe niile.
This is a school for young children.	Nke a bụ ụlọ akwụkwọ maka ụmụaka dị obere.
We do not see such a deplorable condition here.	Anyị ahụghị ọnọdụ na-adịghị mma dị otú ahụ ebe a.
It comes here.	Ọ na-abịa ebe a.
But he knew that would not happen.	Ma, ọ ma na nke ahụ agaghị eme.
I saw your machine running.	Ahụrụ m igwe gị na-agba ọsọ.
An example is now at the top.	Otu ihe atụ dị ugbu a n'ebe dị elu.
I do not know where the other one went.	Amaghị m ebe onye nke ọzọ gara.
Your best should be good.	Ihe kacha mma gị kwesịrị ịdị mma.
So we want it to be different and different.	Ya mere, anyị chọrọ ka ọ dị iche iche na dị iche iche.
Some other examples are not.	Ụfọdụ ihe atụ ndị ọzọ abụghị.
But why not.	Ma gịnị mere na ọ bụghị.
He ate the delicious meat.	O ji obi ụtọ rie nri anụ ndị ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
No doubt he saw this funny question.	O doro anya na ọ hụrụ ajụjụ a na-atọ ọchị.
I have an eye on someone else.	Enwere m anya na onye ọzọ.
In this work ,.	Na ọrụ a,.
But we do not think so.	Ma anyị echeghị otú ahụ.
City to do it.	Obodo ime ya.
The city does not have enough cars.	Obodo enweghị ụgbọ ala zuru oke.
But it can't be done.	Mana enweghị ike ime ya.
I do not like cooking these days.	Ọ naghị amasị m isi nri ụbọchị ndị a.
Or twenty, and a perfect car.	Ma ọ bụ iri abụọ, na ụgbọ ala zuru oke.
That is very stupid.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ nzuzu.
So he does it.	Ya mere, ọ na-eme ya.
We need to do something.	Anyị kwesịrị ime ihe.
For these are well known.	N'ihi na ndị a maara nke ọma.
Nothing more.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ.
Now we miss them.	Ugbu a, anyị na-atụ uche ha.
The doctors asked you many questions.	Ndị dọkịta jụrụ gị ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
I love each and every one of them.	Ahụrụ m onye nke ọ bụla n’ime ha n’anya nke ukwuu.

Bar or bar.	Ụlọ mmanya ma ọ bụ mmanya.
It makes it one in reality.	Ọ na-eme ka ọ bụrụ otu na eziokwu.
He is a very special man.	Ọ bụ nwoke pụrụ iche n'ezie.
He told me.	Ọ gwara m .
Then there are questions about the game's incredible difficulty.	Mgbe ahụ, enwere ajụjụ banyere ihe isi ike dị egwu egwuregwu ahụ.
This year could be the same.	Afọ a nwere ike ịbụ otu ihe ahụ.
It's beautiful.	Ọ bụ ihe mara mma.

In my opinion, no.	Echiche m, ọ dịghị.
I don’t think it will be bigger than me.	Echeghị na ọ ga-adị ukwuu karịa m.
His idea is awesome.	Echiche ya dị egwu.
In his eyes, some of you are.	N'anya ya, ụfọdụ n'ime unu mere.
He was really scared.	Ọ tụrụ egwu n'ezie.
I am still trying to find the perfect one.	M ka na-agbalị ịchọta nke zuru oke.
They are all sort of.	Ha niile bụ ụdị.
But then it happens.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ na-eme.
Still, it is near.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ bụ ihe dị nso.
The member knows where he came from.	Onye otu ahụ maara ebe o si bịa.
Before that, they did not exist.	Tupu mgbe ahụ, ha adịghị adị.
Now you do not see him because he is far away.	Ugbu a, ị naghị ahụ ya n'ihi na ọ dị anya.
Grandchildren are never happy with their grandparents.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ụmụ ụmụ na-enwe mmasị na nne na nna ha ochie.
This is not the case.	Nke a abụghị ihe dị otú ahụ.

We will do it again this week.	Anyị ga-eme ya ọzọ n'izu a.
Of course, it is the other way around.	N'ezie, ọ bụ n'ụzọ ọzọ.
It is very new.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ihe ọhụrụ.
It requires more than manual labor.	Ọ na-achọ ihe ọzọ karịa ọrụ aka.
Years and years and years.	Afọ na afọ na afọ ha.
Do whatever they want.	Na-eme ihe ọ bụla ha chọrọ.
Somehow, it was not done.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ọ bụghị ihe e mere.
Time goes on.	Oge na-aga n'ihu.
The workers of the last ten.	Ndị na-arụ ọrụ ụzọ iri nke ikpeazụ.
This way is better to travel.	Ụzọ a ka mma ịga njem.
They said they did not have one.	Ha kwuru na ha enweghị otu.
It is everyday life.	Ọ bụ ndụ kwa ụbọchị.
He was surprised when he called her home.	O juru ya anya mgbe ọ kpọrọ ya n’ụlọ.
We can do it with other foods.	Anyị nwere ike iji nri ndị ọzọ mee ya.
We will do our best.	Anyị ga-eme ike anyị niile.
At first, the idea of ​​responsibility was higher.	Na mbụ, echiche nke ibu ọrụ dị elu karịa.
But only here.	Mana naanị ebe a.
We are running fast.	Anyị na-agba ọsọ ọsọ.
One is not good.	Otu adịghị mma.
He did it again and again.	O mere ya ugboro ugboro.

Only then will you feel better.	Naanị ahụ ga-adị gị mma.
I think it is more now than ever.	Echere m na ọ dị ugbu a karịa mgbe ọ bụla.
They have a high opinion.	Ha nwere echiche dị elu.
You are in his presence.	Ị nọ n'ebe ọ nọ.
He did it himself.	O mere ya n'onwe ya.
They left the land.	Ha hapụrụ ala ahụ.
Not in our time.	Ọ bụghị n'oge anyị nwere.
Now is the time.	Ugbu a bụ oge.
We challenge ourselves, our customers and the company.	Anyị na-ama onwe anyị aka, ndị ahịa anyị na ụlọ ọrụ.
He put on a confident face.	O tinyere ihu nwere obi ike.
I don’t want it to stop.	Achọghị m ka ọ kwụsị.
This can be a challenge for many of us.	Nke a nwere ike bụrụ ihe ịma aka nye ọtụtụ n'ime anyị.
She may be your best friend.	O nwere ike ịbụ ezigbo enyi gị.
They have no reason to.	Ha enweghị ihe kpatara ya.
That is our window.	Nke ahụ bụ windo anyị.
All of this is good.	Ihe ndị a niile dị mma.
Ask him to be there by 12 o'clock tomorrow.	Gwa ya ka ọ nọrọ ebe ahụ n'elekere iri na abụọ echi.
Probably thinking of the other person.	Eleghị anya na-eche echiche nke onye nke ọzọ.
They promised it would be easy.	Ha kwere nkwa na ọ ga-adị mfe.
You know it did.	Ị ma na o mere.
I'm sure you will be fine.	Eji m n'aka na ị ga-adị mma.
He was upset, but there was nothing he could do.	Obi adịghị ya ụtọ, ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ pụrụ ime.
He slapped her in the face.	Ọ mara ya ụra n'ihu.
You can't say anything, you know?	Ị nweghị ike ikwu ihe ọ bụla, ị maara?
He looked closely.	O lere nke ọma anya.

This is our right.	Nke a bụ ikike anyị.
But these can be negative.	Ma ndị a nwere ike ịbụ ihe na-adịghị mma.

I don’t think of it as anything more than what it is.	Echeghị m ya dị ka ihe ọ bụla ọzọ karịa ihe ọ bụ.

Like night and day.	Dị ka abalị na ehihie.
I like to run on the beach.	Ọ na-amasị m ịgba ọsọ n'akụkụ osimiri.
This is it, the moment of truth.	Nke a bụ ya, oge nke eziokwu.
Someone stole my purse!	Ọ nwere onye zuru obere akpa m!
I like playing music, but there is something wrong with it.	Ọ na-amasị m ịkpọ egwu, mana ọ nwere ihe adịghị mma.

There is no reason to waste your life.	O nweghị ihe mere ị ga-eji na-egwu ndụ gị.

We are not close to life.	Anyị anọghị nso na ndụ.
I'm sorry for that.	Ọ dị m nwute maka nke ahụ.
That is a different matter.	Nke ahụ bụ okwu dị iche.
It is true that many died.	Ọ bụ eziokwu na ọtụtụ ndị nwụrụ.
Enjoy your trip, we love it !!.	Nwee obi ụtọ njem gị, anyị hụrụ ya n'anya!!.
I want to be a friend.	Achọrọ m ka anyị bụrụ enyi.
The language did.	Asụsụ ahụ mere.
So go for it.	Ya mere, gaa maka ya.
All of this is an important task.	Ihe ndị a niile bụ ọrụ dị mkpa.
That is easier said than done.	Nke ahụ dị mfe ikwu karịa ime.
Many died.	Ọtụtụ ndị nwụrụ.
However, it is not men.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị ụmụ nwoke.
Not to mention the current situation.	Ọ bụghị ikwu banyere ọnọdụ dị ugbu a.
He could not do that.	O nweghị ike ime nke ahụ.
With him, you can do whatever you want.	Mụ na ya, ị nwere ike ime ihe masịrị gị.
I said it was good, but it was.	M kwuru na ọ dị mma, ma ọ dị.
They are not that bad.	Ha adịghị njọ otú ahụ.
He has clear green eyes.	O nwere anya akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ doro anya.
However, this is a different matter.	Otú ọ dị, nke a bụ ihe dị iche.
However, in summer.	Otú ọ dị, na okpomọkụ.
We both love it.	Anyị abụọ hụrụ ya n'anya.
You do not eat well.	Ị naghị eri nri nke ọma.
However, another way has been found, life can be very new every day.	Otú ọ dị, a hụrụ ụzọ ọzọ, ndụ nwere ike ịdị ọhụrụ nke ukwuu kwa ụbọchị.
This boy is running.	Nwata a na-agba.
He could see the woman ahead of him on the road.	O nwere ike ịhụ nwanyị ahụ n'ihu n'ụzọ.
Probably never.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dịghị mgbe.
We do not know how to do that.	Anyị amaghị otu esi eme nke ahụ.
A few happy customers said no.	Ndị ahịa ole na ole nwere obi ụtọ kwuru mba.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọjọọ na-eme n'ebe ahụ.
Not really what it is about.	Ọ bụghị n'ezie ihe ọ bụ banyere.
Here is one way to go.	Nke a bụ otu ụzọ ị ga-esi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị njọ ka ihe niile ahụ.
We still have a special situation.	Anyị ka nwere ọnọdụ pụrụ iche.
He is a handsome man.	Ọ bụ nwoke mara mma.
They hope you will come and get them.	Ha tụrụ anya na ị ga-abịa nweta ha.
Others should go to court.	Ndị ọzọ kwesịrị ịga ikpe.
However, this is an expensive plan.	Otú ọ dị, nke a bụ atụmatụ dị oke ọnụ.
It seems to come from everywhere.	Ọ dị ka o si n'ebe niile bịa.
But it does not always work that way.	Ma ọ bụghị mgbe niile ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ otú ahụ.
People liked it.	Ndị mmadụ masịrị ya.
If so, what is one way to do it?	Ọ bụrụ otú ahụ, gịnị bụ ụzọ isi mee nke a.
It should be a job, a school.	Ọ kwesịrị ịbụ ọrụ, ụlọ akwụkwọ.

People can be really stupid at times.	Ndị mmadụ nwere ike ịbụ ezigbo nzuzu mgbe ụfọdụ.
Then came the new year.	Mgbe ahụ, afọ ọhụrụ ga-abịa.
Because sometimes we do that.	N'ihi na mgbe ụfọdụ anyị na-eme nke ahụ.
He did his best to make sure everything was in order.	O mere ike ya niile iji hụ na ihe niile dị mma.
But the window of opportunity is small.	Ma windo ohere ha dị ntakịrị.
How bad his face is.	Otú ihu ya si dị njọ.
So next time.	Ya mere, oge ọzọ.
This is a big problem.	Nke a bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
You say that.	Ị na-ekwu nke ahụ.
I will need time to get to know him again.	Aga m achọ oge iji mara ya ahụ ọzọ.
That is complete foolishness.	Nke ahụ bụ nzuzu zuru oke.
I hope the information will help !.	Echere na ozi ahụ ga-enyere aka!.
People are united.	Ndị mmadụ dị n'otu.
We can not do that.	Anyị enweghị ike ime otú ahụ.
A place where people can be alone.	Ebe ndị mmadụ nwere ike ịnọ naanị ya.
Two are boys, and the third is a girl.	Abụọ bụ ụmụ nwoke, nke atọ bụ nwa agbọghọ.

When he wants it done, he wants it done.	Mgbe ọ chọrọ ka e mee ya, ọ chọrọ ka e mee ya.
Not a place.	Ọ bụghị ebe.
It is good till now.	Ọ dị mma ruo ugbu a.
He knows that, now here in his own room.	Ọ maara nke ahụ, ugbu a, ebe a n'ime ime ụlọ nke ya.
He does a lot, man.	Ọ na-eme nke ukwuu, nwoke.
It's hard to say.	O siri ike ikwu okwu.
But there are about a dozen doors here.	Mana enwere ihe dị ka ọnụ ụzọ iri na abụọ ebe a.

This is hard for us in this.	Nke a bụ ihe siri ike nye anyị na nke a.
This is a dog, they say.	Nke a bụ nkịta, ha na-ekwu.
Water as, if not more, important.	Mmiri dị ka, ma ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị karịa, dị mkpa.
His mother is.	Nne ya bụ.
He thinks about their lives before any of these things.	Ọ na-eche banyere ndụ ha tupu nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a.
We know this boy very well.	Anyị maara nwa nwoke a nke ọma.
I don't want to play again.	Achọghị m igwu egwu ọzọ.
Getting there is easy.	Ịga ebe ahụ dị mfe.
Do it well, and there is.	Mee ya nke ọma, ma enwere.
His books are constantly being sought.	A na-achọ akwụkwọ ya mgbe niile.
I will go for a test.	Aga m aga ule.
Running is the same thing.	Ịgba ọsọ bụ otu ihe ahụ.
At least they will live.	Ma ọ́ dịghị ihe ọzọ, ha ga-adị ndụ.
That is their job.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ ha.
Some have no idea why.	Ụfọdụ enweghị echiche banyere ihe kpatara ya.
It does not make it easy.	Ọ naghị eme ka ọ dị mfe.
As if something different was happening there.	Dị ka ọ dị ihe dị iche na-eme n'ebe ahụ.
Water is very important.	Mmiri dị oke mkpa.
But it does not work in this case.	Mana ọ naghị arụ ọrụ na nke a.
Not when you think about it.	Ọ bụghị mgbe ị na-eche banyere ya.
The company expects a lot of opportunities.	Ụlọ ọrụ na-atụ anya ọtụtụ ohere.
Things will be better, he said.	Ihe ga-adị mma, o kwuru.
It was a great day.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ụbọchị.

This is simple.	Nke a dị mfe.
The ship left port yesterday.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ hapụrụ ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ụnyaahụ.

You know what will happen.	Ị maara ihe ga-eme.
If you really want this, there is something wrong.	Ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ nke a n'ezie, ọ nwere ihe adịghị mma.
Curious.	Achọrọ ịma.
This may be the best summer of their lives.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ oge okpomọkụ kacha mma na ndụ ha.
But he really died.	Ma ọ nwụrụ n'ezie.
But the idea is huge.	Ma echiche bụ nnukwu.
The excitement surprised me.	Obi ụtọ ahụ tụrụ m n'anya.
He could not say what it was.	O nweghị ike ikwu ihe ọ bụ.
Of course, this is the case.	N'ezie, nke a bụ ikpe.
However, thank you.	Otú ọ dị, daalụ.
To each his own.	Nye onye ọ bụla nke ya.
This happens sometimes.	Nke a na-eme mgbe ụfọdụ.
Ten years is a long time.	Afọ iri bụ ogologo oge.
He loves her very much.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
Thanks for that.	Daalụ maka nke ahụ.
He has no weapons.	O nweghị ngwa ọgụ.
What does he say.	Gịnị ka ọ na-ekwu.
Tonight the car is here.	N'abalị a ụgbọ ala dị ebe a.
But for him, it was nothing.	Ma nye ya, ọ bụghị ihe ọ bụla.
I am in trouble.	Anọ m na nsogbu.
The family rushed away.	Ezinụlọ ahụ gbara ọsọ ngwa ngwa.
I need my own room.	Achọrọ m ime ụlọ nke m.
The last book died.	Akwụkwọ ikpeazụ nwụrụ.
I can't find it.	Enweghị m ike ịchọta ya.
All three are like that.	Ha atọ otú ahụ.
That is the problem with the game.	Nke ahụ bụ nsogbu dị na egwuregwu ahụ.
We do this every night, not us.	Anyị na-eme nke a kwa abalị, ọ bụghị anyị.
Other issues are clear now.	Okwu ndị ọzọ doro anya ugbu a.
Not true.	Ọ bụghị eziokwu.
He told her never to do it again.	Ọ gwara ya ka ọ ghara ime otú ahụ ọzọ.
Now he sees it as little as possible.	Ugbu a, ọ hụrụ ya ntakịrị ka o kwere mee.
The movie is tonight.	Ihe nkiri a bụ abalị a.
He has his limits.	O nwere oke ya.
This is a great help.	Nke a bụ ihe enyemaka dị egwu.
You have three.	Ị nwere atọ.
But today we gave everything.	Ma taa anyị nyere ihe niile.
The city he loves and is trying to get out of.	Obodo ọ hụrụ n'anya ma na-agbalị ịpụ.
He told her his salary.	Ọ gwara ya ụgwọ ọrụ ya.
It's too scary.	Ọ dị oke egwu.
Which is stupid, of course.	Nke bụ nzuzu, n'ezie.
This is on the side of the headline.	Nke a dị n'akụkụ isi okwu.
It will always be in the news.	Ọ ga-anọ na akụkọ mgbe niile.
It has beauty.	O nwere mma.
Please let me know if anything happened to you.	Biko mee ka m mara ma ihe ọ bụla mere gị.
I will not allow that to happen again.	Agaghị m ekwe ka nke ahụ mee ọzọ.
Some of the first encounters with these were cruel and frightening.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ndị mbụ zutere ndị a bụ obi ọjọọ na egwu.
This is mine now.	Nke a bụ nke m ugbu a.
What happened took him very seriously.	Ihe merenụ were ya nke ukwuu.
But there it is.	Ma ebe ahụ ka ọ dị.
But he does not want to help them.	Ma ọ chọghị inyere ha aka.
Not the main problem.	Ọ bụghị isi nsogbu.
That is easy to say.	Nke ahụ dị mfe ikwu.
Not in your eyes.	Ọ bụghị n'anya gị.
This should happen on both sides.	Nke a kwesịrị ime n'akụkụ abụọ.
It is too cold.	Ọ dị oke oyi.
They can be good.	Ha nwere ike ịdị mma.
He was here with you during the trial.	Ya na gị nọ ebe a n'oge ikpe ahụ.
We never took our lives.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị gbara ọsọ ndụ anyị.
I saw the way it went.	Ahụrụ m ụzọ o si pụọ.
This has implications for its employees.	Nke a nwere mmetụta maka ndị ọrụ ya.
It looks like you are close to the event.	Ọ dị ka ị nọ nso ihe omume ahụ.
He did not want her to do this.	Ọ chọghị ka o mee nke a.
This building has a great historical significance.	Ụlọ a nwere nnukwu mkpa akụkọ ihe mere eme.
It is his anger.	Ọ bụ iwe ya.
He craves meat and fish.	Anụ na azụ̀ na-agụ ya agụụ.
I am enthusiastic.	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu.
The study was conducted with mice.	E mere ihe ọmụmụ ahụ na ụmụ oke.
We are better than that but we do not take it lightly.	Anyị ka nke ahụ mma mana anyị ejighị ya egwu egwu.
There are others.	E nwere ndị ọzọ.
He invited me to lunch.	Ọ kpọrọ m ka m bịa nri ehihie.
People work.	Ndị mmadụ na-arụ ọrụ.
These are two boys.	Ndị a bụ ụmụ nwoke abụọ.
They did not see us.	Ha ahụghị anyị.
Should be very high.	Kwesịrị ịdị elu nke ukwuu.
He wants to leave.	Ọ chọrọ ịla.
It may not require liquid.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị achọ mmiri mmiri.
There are two problems with this approach.	Enwere nsogbu abụọ na ụzọ a.
Summer is a beautiful time of year.	Oge okpomọkụ bụ oge mara mma n'afọ.
She does not miss much.	Ọ naghị atụ uche nke ukwuu.
It is just an example.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe atụ.
I have his ears, people say.	Enwere m ntị ya, ndị mmadụ na-ekwu.
Day to week.	Ụbọchị ruo izu.
He did not want a car or a clear house.	Ọ chọghị ụgbọ ala ma ọ bụ doro anya ụlọ.
They have legs.	Ha nwere ụkwụ.
Now one last thought.	Ugbu a otu echiche ikpeazụ.
First, there are the people.	Mbụ, e nwere ndị mmadụ.
He looked at it carefully.	O lere ya anya nke ọma.
I do not know when.	Amaghị m mgbe.
But whether I have it or not, it will happen.	Mana enwere m ma ọ bụ enweghị m, ọ ga-eme.
It's tough.	O siri ike.
I do not know what this story is.	Amaghị m ihe akụkọ a bụ.
But there are people out there who need help.	Ma e nwere ndị nọ n’ebe ahụ bụ́ ndị ọ dị mkpa ka e nyere ha aka.
We have many plans.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ atụmatụ.
Of what he had, and now never.	Nke ihe ọ na-enweghị, na ugbu a ọ dịghị mgbe.
But that is far from over.	Mana nke ahụ dị anya.
I would like if you can do this every day.	Ọ ga-amasị m ma ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike ime nke a kwa ụbọchị.
It has kids on the back.	O nwere ụmụaka n'azụ.
But that does not work today.	Mana nke ahụ anaghị arụ ọrụ oge a.
He does it himself.	Ọ na-eme ya n'onwe ya.
You can talk to anyone.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa onye ọ bụla okwu.
There are some things that are hard to do.	O nwere ihe ụfọdụ siri ike ime.
The dress was made.	E mere akwa ahụ.
Nothing happened to him.	O nweghị ihe mere ya.
That may still be so, of course.	Nke ahụ ka nwere ike ịdị otú ahụ, n'ezie.
Most people do not have enough money.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ enweghị ego zuru oke.
But it is not easy.	Ma ọ dịghị mfe.
His own ideas are baseless.	Echiche nke ya enweghị isi.
It can easily be true.	Ọ pụrụ ịdị mfe ịbụ eziokwu.
I'm not sure he liked it.	Adịghị m n'aka na ọ masịrị ya.
Or not.	Ma ọ bụ ọ bụghị.
He said he was very angry.	O kwuru na iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
Not the company.	Ọ bụghị ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
The wine is good.	Mmanya ahụ dị mma.
I have a book.	Enwere m akwụkwọ.
They can look invisible.	Ha pụrụ iche anya na-adịghị ahụ anya.
I love it.	Ahụrụ m anya n'anya.
It was our second day.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị nke abụọ anyị.
It is very beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
Take your time.	Were oge gị.
Power on it.	Ike na ya.
I hope it helps you !.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ ga-enyere gị aka!.
But this is not really the case.	Ma nke a abụghị n'ezie ikpe.
What color is her eye?	Kedu agba anya ya?
He was never surprised.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.
He seems to know it well.	Ọ dị ka ọ maara nke ọma.
There is not much in my life.	O nweghị ihe ka ukwuu na ndụ m.
Right foot forward.	Ụkwụ aka nri n'ihu.
I have one of those.	Enwere m otu n'ime ndị ahụ.
You all make it easy.	Unu niile na-eme ka ọ dị mfe.
Well, here it is.	Ọ dị mma, ebe a bụ.
They will like it.	Ha ga-amasị ya.
She is the mother of three children.	Ọ bụ nne nke ụmụ atọ.
Otherwise, the first word you use will be fine, again.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, okwu mbụ ị ga-eji ga-adị mma, ọzọ.
That is fun.	Nke ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
You can do this at home, people.	Ị nwere ike ime nke a n'ụlọ, ndị mmadụ.
His work was a great success.	Ọrụ ya bụ nnukwu ihe ịga nke ọma.
Probably so.	Ma eleghị anya, otú ahụ ka o kwesịrị ịdị.
The man died in prison.	Nwoke ahụ nwụrụ n'ụlọ mkpọrọ.
Perfect fun and game.	Ihe ọchị na egwuregwu zuru oke.
Now go and do it.	Ugbu a, gaa mee ya.
In fact, it does not seem to be a room.	N'ezie, o yighị ka ọ̀ bụ ọnụ ụlọ.
But be clear.	Mana nwee ahụ ihe ị mere doro anya.
Just a little bit.	Naanị ntakịrị.
These books are for my sister.	Akwụkwọ ndị a bụ maka nwanne m nwanyị.
There are two possibilities for this to happen.	Enwere ọnọdụ abụọ ka nke a nwere ike isi mee.
We look forward to assisting him in his work.	A tụrụ anya na anyị ga-enyere ya aka n’ọrụ ya.
That does not matter.	Nke ahụ adịghị mkpa.
It can only be given.	Enwere ike inye ya naanị.
She wants a baby.	Ọ chọrọ nwa.
Sit back and relax.	Nọdụ ala ma zuru ike.
Here again, such is the case.	Ebe a ọzọ, dị otú ahụ bụ ikpe.
Now they need to hurry.	Ugbu a ha chọrọ ọsọ ọsọ.
We all like it.	Ihe niile na-amasị anyị.
It's fast.	Ọ dị ngwa.
The meat is very nutritious.	Anụ ahụ na-eri nri nke ukwuu.
I do not know what happened.	Amaghị m ihe merenụ.
Things seem to be going well at first.	Ihe yiri ka ọ na-aga nke ọma na mbụ.
But there is no reason, it is just practice.	Mana ọ nweghị ihe mere, ọ bụ naanị omume.
He needed rest more than anything else.	Ọ chọrọ izu ike karịa ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
The legs did not see the approaching train.	Ụkwụ ahụ ahụghị ụgbọ na-abịa.
We do not see why.	Anyị ahụghị ihe kpatara ya.
On my way.	N'ụzọ m.
The work is very important.	Ọrụ ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa.
Of course, we are not in any trouble.	N'ezie, anyị anọghị na nsogbu ọ bụla.
The genre is independent of actors and professional actors.	Ụdị ahụ enweghị onwe ya na ndị na-eme ihe nkiri na nke ọrụ.
It is very different.	Ọ dị nnọọ iche.
This is what you like.	Nke a bụ ihe na-amasị gị.
Or at least it could be.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ pụrụ ịbụ.
One, or they may not use absolute authority.	Otu, ma ọ bụ na ha enweghị ike iji ikike zuru oke.
I don't work much there.	Anaghị m arụ ọrụ nke ukwuu ebe ahụ.
He has a special eye.	O nwere anya pụrụ iche n'anya ya.
Some of it you have to do.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ya ị ga-eme ya.
Or go away.	Ma ọ bụ pụọ.
I would love to be able to use a service like this.	Ọ ga-amasị m inwe ike iji ọrụ dị ka nke a.
This is the worst.	Nke a kacha njọ.
It is very easy to do.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe ime.
No one has done so before.	Ọ dịghị onye mere otú ahụ mbụ.
He was interested in human rights.	O nwere mmasị na ikike mmadụ.
He thought about that.	O chere banyere nke ahụ.
I would be happy to just call.	M gaara enwe obi ụtọ na naanị ịkpọ ekwentị.
I know a lot of people did.	Ama m na ọtụtụ mmadụ mere ya.
You can not wait for hours and days.	Ị gaghị echere awa na ụbọchị.
I was terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ m nke ukwuu.
About thirty feet.	Ihe dị ka ụkwụ iri atọ.
Over the years, many small businesses have sprung up.	Kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ, ọtụtụ obere ụlọ ọrụ malitere.
No life is more meaningful than the other.	Ọ dịghị ndụ bara uru karịa ibe ya.
Continue from there until their fourth year.	Na-aga n'ihu site n'ebe ahụ ruo n'afọ nke anọ ha.
His laughter was quick.	Ọchị ọchị ya dị ngwa.
The trees have hands.	Osisi ndị ahụ nwere aka.
How does one live on low wages?	Kedu ka mmadụ ga-esi bi na obere ụgwọ ọnwa?
Of course we did.	N'ezie, anyị mere.
My uncle is a sister.	Nwanne nna bụ nwanne nwanyị.
It is the same message.	Ọ bụ otu ozi ahụ.
This is the practice he does.	Nke a bụ omume ọ na-eme.
It goes a long way for him.	Ọ na-aga nke ukwuu maka ya.
Nothing but yourself and what you want to do.	Ọ dịghị ihe ma onwe gị na ihe ị chọrọ ime.
There is not much water here.	Enweghị nnukwu mmiri ebe a.
Do what you need to do.	Mee ihe dị gị mkpa ime.
He liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya.
Then he became angry.	Mgbe ahụ o were iwe.
I'm not a lot of people.	Abụghị m ọtụtụ mmadụ.
You clearly understand what he is thinking.	Ị ghọtara nke ọma ihe ọ na-eche.
This is one of the few.	Nke a bụ otu n'ime ole na ole.
Maybe someone should, but you like it as much as it does.	Ma eleghị anya, mmadụ kwesịrị, ma ọ masịrị gị nke ọma otú ọ dị.
You know it, but sometimes sales staff don’t.	Ị maara ya, ma mgbe ụfọdụ ndị ọrụ ahịa adịghị.
There is no doubt about it.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na nke ahụ.
One cannot think of it as a woman.	Mmadụ enweghị ike iche na ọ bụ nwanyị.
And boy, is it fun.	Na nwa nwoke, ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
But that did not work out.	Ma nke ahụ emeghị nke ọma.
And in the ground where it still exists.	Na n'ime ala ebe ọ ka dị.
Coffee is weak.	Kọfị adịghị ike.
I think this is a game.	Echere m na nke a bụ egwuregwu.
To get an idea.	Iji nweta echiche.
This room has many windows.	Ụlọ a nwere ọtụtụ windo.
He can see that.	O nwere ike ịhụ nke ahụ.
That will not be the case.	A gaghị enwe nke ahụ.
The company has no employees.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ enweghị ndị ọrụ.
Either he or she.	Ma ọ bụghị ya ma ọ bụ na ya.
People heard our story.	Ndị mmadụ nụrụ akụkọ anyị.
I will not wait.	Agaghị m echere.
Or this.	Ma ọ bụ a.
But using it can be both good and bad.	Ma iji ya nwere ike ịbụ ma ihe ọma na ihe ọjọọ.
That’s what he wants to get out of.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ chọrọ ịpụ.
Tell me the truth.	Gwa m eziokwu.
Each one.	Nke ọ bụla n'ime ya.
I really appreciate your feedback.	Echiche gị masịrị m nke ukwuu.
So he is not alone.	Ya mere, ọ bụghị naanị ya.
No one knows where he is.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ebe ọ nọ.
But it was expected.	Ma a tụrụ anya ya.
It makes me wonder when it is.	Ọ na-eme ka m na-eche mgbe ọ dị.
He was angry.	Iwe were ya.
They have a short time.	Ha nwere obere oge.
They really aren't.	Ha abụghị n'ezie.
As a child, he loved to play sports.	Mgbe ọ bụ nwata, ọ na-enwe mmasị igwu egwuregwu.
It's so delicious.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
He will not allow it to happen.	Ọ gaghị ekwe ka ọ mee.
Died two days ago.	Nwụrụ ụbọchị abụọ gara aga.
Because there is nothing else to do.	N'ihi na ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ime.
I do not know about this.	Amaghị m maka nke a.
First wife.	Nwanyị mbụ.
They do not know anyone.	Ha amaghị onye ọ bụla.
Something terrible happened.	Ihe dị egwu mere.
It's not good.	Ọ naghị adị mma.
She needs another man for years.	Ọ chọrọ nwoke ọzọ afọ.
He thinks he has authority over it.	Ọ na-eche na ya nwere ikike n'ebe ọ nọ.
Tell her that is for her daughter.	Gwa ya na nke ahụ bụ maka nwa ya nwanyị.
It’s anything you can use.	Ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla ị nwere ike iji ya mee.
That time was awesome.	Oge ahụ dị oke egwu.
There is nothing we can do now.	O nweghị ihe anyị ga-eme ugbu a.
Like a new weather station.	Dị ka ọdụ ihu igwe ọhụrụ.
Some do.	Ụfọdụ na-eme ya.
Not me.	Ọ bụghị m.
He will never use it again.	Ọ gaghị eji ya ọzọ.
Our destination is far away.	Ebe anyị na-aga dị anya.
It is good and it is bad.	Ọ dị mma ma dị njọ.
They helped but not that.	Ha nyere aka mana ọ bụghị nke ahụ.
Any ideas will help.	Echiche ọ bụla ga-enyere aka.
He lives in his hometown.	O bi na obodo ya.
Now you know why.	Ugbu a, ị maara ihe kpatara ya.
There is a lot of work.	Enwere nnukwu ọrụ.
It is the best.	Ọ bụ ya kacha mma.
The room is full.	Ime ụlọ juru.
This is the case now.	Nke a bụ ikpe ugbu a.
Well, this is really useful.	Ọ dị mma, nke a bara uru n'ezie.
It's just.	Ọ dị nnọọ.
He said he could make the bridge.	O kwuru na ya nwere ike ime akwa mmiri ahụ.
Either way, it’s the same truth.	Nke ọ bụla, ọ bụ otu eziokwu ahụ.
Each couple lasted about a week.	Di na nwunye ọ bụla gbara ihe dị ka otu izu.
He is a good boy.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwa.
So this is what happened to him.	Ya mere, nke a bụ ihe mere ya.
Last color.	Agba ikpeazụ.
The speed of the narrative is awe-inspiring.	Ịdị ngwa nke akụkọ akụkọ ahụ tụrụ ụjọ.
It is not good at all.	Ọ dịghị mma ma ọlị.
None of them expected to see him again.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ha tụrụ anya ịhụ ya ọzọ.
It's not scary now.	Ọ bụghị egwu ugbu a.
Everyone stopped immediately.	Onye ọ bụla kwụsịrị ozugbo.
As expected no.	Dị ka a tụrụ anya na ọ dịghị.
I think that is impossible.	Echere m na nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume.
And the human face is awesome.	Na ihu mmadụ dị egwu.
There is an immediate need for more.	Enwere mkpa ozugbo maka ihe ndị ọzọ.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
You challenge them.	Ị na-ama ha aka.
There are so many of them.	Enwere nnọọ ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
I have no sense at all.	Enwere m isi na-enweghị isi.
Take some pictures in the same way without it.	Were ụfọdụ foto n'otu ụzọ ahụ na-enweghị ya.
For whatever this is.	Maka ihe ọ bụla nke a bụ.
They can't have.	Ha enweghị ike inwe.
It was the first time he had ever looked so beautiful.	Ọ bụ nke mbụ ọ hụrụ ka ọ mara mma.
She is my best friend and loves me very much.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi m ma hụ m n'anya nke ukwuu.
Our salaries are low.	Ụgwọ ọnwa anyị dị obere.
It will not exist now.	Ọ gaghị adị ugbu a.
She is happy.	Obi dị ya mma.
He was surprised	O juru ya anya
According to your taste.	Dị ka ihe na-amasị gị.
None of this happened.	Ọ dịghị nke merenụ.
Everyone took a good look at me.	Onye ọ bụla lere m anya nke ọma.
Then another threat and the name of something.	Mgbe ahụ ọzọ egwu na aha ihe.
Know that there is another.	Maara na e nwere nke ọzọ.
What they say.	Ihe ha na-ekwu.
But the idea can be overwhelming.	Mana echiche ahụ nwere ike ịdị oke njọ.
Many of these points are useful.	Ọtụtụ n'ime isi ihe ndị a bara uru.
We do not want one.	Anyị achọghị otu.
The story is not.	Akụkọ abụghị.
He was angry.	O were iwe.
He did not want her to leave.	Ọ chọghị ka ọ pụọ.
It is such a small situation.	Ọ bụ ọnọdụ dị nta otú ahụ.
Of course not.	N'ezie, ha abụghị.
That power is real.	Ike nke ahụ dị adị.
Stop fighting and fight.	Kwụsị ọgụ na ọgụ kwụsị.
He knew it wasn't really good.	Ọ maara na ọ naghị adị mma n'ezie.
This is his second night without sleep.	Nke a bụ abalị nke abụọ ya enweghị ụra.
Why is he afraid?	Gịnị mere o ji atụ egwu?
I'd like to talk to you when you can.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịgwa gị okwu mgbe ị nwere ike.
There is something different this time.	Ọ dị ihe dị iche n'oge a.
What a good time.	Kedu oge dị mma.
The distance is too high.	Ebe dị anya dị oke oke.
His words are here.	Okwu ya dị ebe a.
Of course, the issue is important.	N'ezie, okwu ahụ bụ ihe dị mkpa.
Today it is not true.	Taa abụghị eziokwu.
I do not want this for you.	Achọghị m gị ihe a.
Not bad.	Ọ dịghị njọ.
There is a lot of money around there.	Enwere nnukwu ego n'akụkụ ebe ahụ.
He was surprised last year.	O juru ya anya afọ gara aga.
I try to think of something else.	M na-agbalị iche echiche banyere ihe ọzọ.
Her eyes were wet.	Anya ya dị mmiri.
In it are their strengths and weaknesses.	N'ime ya ka ike ha na adịghị ike ha dị.
That is why we are able to do that.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị ji nwee ike ime nke ahụ.
Because I love them more than you know.	N'ihi na ahụrụ m ha n'anya karịa ka ị maara.
Drink like coffee.	Na-aṅụ dị ka kọfị.
They tried to tell me, each of them.	Ha gbalịrị ịgwa m, onye ọ bụla n’ime ha.
If you really want to, you have to do it.	Ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ n'ezie, ị ga-eme ya.
Hopefully those two are the things they can say.	Olileanya na ihe abụọ ahụ bụ ihe ha nwere ike ikwu.
This time seems like the worst.	Oge a dị ka nke kacha njọ.
We stopped eating.	Anyị kwụsịrị iri nri.
They are all money.	Ha niile bụ ego.
As a family environment.	Dị ka gburugburu ezinụlọ.
People rejected this.	Ndị mmadụ jụrụ nke a.
I don’t cook my own all the time.	Anaghị m esi nri nke m oge niile.
The best night of my life.	Abalị kacha mma nke ndụ m.
There will be no more.	Agaghị adị ọzọ.
We can go on for a long time.	Anyị nwere ike ịga n'ihu ruo ogologo oge.
I think you will go.	Echere m na ị ga-aga.
Each letter will be unique.	Akwụkwọ ozi ọ bụla ga-abụ ihe pụrụ iche.
It's a good feeling.	Ọ bụ mmetụta dị mma.
So, for that matter, there is no question.	Ya mere, maka ya, ọ dịghị ajụjụ.
You are a good player.	Ị dị mma egwuregwu.
It is all that life requires of us.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe ndụ chọrọ ka anyị bụrụ.
We can do many things if we have more money.	Anyị nwere ike ime ọtụtụ ihe ma ọ bụrụ na anyị nwere ego karịa.
He thought it might be bad.	O chere na ọ nwere ike ịdị njọ.
Of course, it is more than that.	N'ezie, ọ bụ karịa nke ahụ.
Not only good words, but good deeds too.	Ọ bụghị naanị okwu dị mma, mana omume doro anya kwa.
They are smart and friendly.	Ha maara ihe na enyi.
I live nearby.	M bi nso.
And so on.	Na otú ahụ.
I have something to do.	Enwere m ihe m ga-eme.
The last word is clear.	Okwu ikpeazụ doro anya.
I was really happy to see him.	Obi dị m ụtọ n'ezie ịhụ ya.
The women are mothers in my eyes.	Ụmụ nwanyị ndị ahụ bụ nne n'anya m.
He visited many big houses as a child.	Ọ gara ọtụtụ nnukwu ụlọ mgbe ọ bụ nwata.
Not everyone thinks so, obviously.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla na-eche otú ahụ, o doro anya.
I can't see anything.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla.
One night may not be the best.	Otu abalị nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ nke kacha mma .
It's cold.	O nwere oyi.
Press conference.	Nzukọ ndị nta akụkọ.
Most likely it is anyone.	O yikarịrị ka ọ bụ onye ọ bụla.
Seeing a tree made him angry.	Ịhụ osisi mere ka iwe were ya.
It's really cheap.	Ọ dị ọnụ ala n'ezie.
This is a big problem.	Nke a bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
Big, strong, boy who loves violence.	Nnukwu, ike, nwa nwoke hụrụ ime ihe ike n'anya.
He told many lies.	O mere ọtụtụ ụgha.
It is a large building with many stories.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ụlọ nke nwere ọtụtụ akụkọ.
From pregnancy to final birth is three weeks.	Site na ime ime ruo na ọmụmụ ikpeazụ bụ izu atọ.
It's hard to talk about it.	O siri ike ikwu maka ya.
In each living being there is something unique.	N'ime onye ọ bụla dị ndụ bụ ihe pụrụ iche.
I know myself better than anyone who knows me.	Amaara m onwe m karịa onye ọ bụla maara m.
The most important thing is practice.	Ihe kacha mkpa bụ omume.
I was happy to call him my brother.	Obi dị m ụtọ ịkpọ ya nwanne m nwoke.
They are so different from you.	Ha dị nnọọ iche na gị.
As soon as he asked her about them.	Ozugbo ọ jụrụ ya banyere ha.
He looked closer.	O lere anya nso.
But that is not the point we are talking about.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị isi ihe anyị na-ekwu.
It will not get better.	Ọ gaghị aka mma.
But it does have a negative effect.	Ma ọ na-enwe mmetụta ọjọọ.
Like a big brother.	Dị ka nnukwu nwanne.
It seems to be the same as before.	O yiri ka ọ dị na mbụ.
The weather is there	Ihu igwe dị
Then they sail.	Mgbe ahụ, ha na-agba ụgbọ mmiri.
These are problems.	Ndị a bụ nsogbu.
Because of my emotional state.	Ọ bụ n'ihi na ọ bụ ọnọdụ uche m.
Let's take these points for granted.	Ka anyị were isi ihe ndị a n'aka.
But face the same issue.	Ma chere otu okwu ahụ ihu.

Hours of laughter.	Oge awa ọchị.
They are the only residents in this area.	Ha bụ naanị ndị bi na gburugburu ebe a.

All of this is information.	Ihe a niile bụ ozi.
Please let me know about this.	Biko mee ka m mara maka nke a.
He came to tell me.	Ọ bịara ịgwa m.
Cannot be used for anything.	Enweghị ike iji ya mee ihe ọ bụla.
Not twice a day.	Ọ bụghị ugboro abụọ n'otu ụbọchị.
People are hungry.	Ndị mmadụ na-agụ ya agụụ.
So this does not happen.	Ya mere, nke a anaghị eme.
There are two practical ways.	Enwere ụzọ abụọ bara uru.
But he doesn't like this.	Ma ọ dịghị amasị nke a.
It is a popular book.	Ọ bụ akwụkwọ a ma ama.
But we have good reason.	Ma anyị nwere nnọọ ihe kpatara ya.
This here and here.	Nke a ebe a na ebe a.
We are all children of the same parents.	Anyị niile bụ ụmụ otu nne na nna.
Despite himself almost.	N'agbanyeghị onwe ya fọrọ nke nta.
Then my baby was born.	Mgbe ahụ nwa m ka a mụrụ.
That kind of food he hated.	Ụdị nri ahụ kpọrọ ya asị.
In this there is a difference.	Na nke a e nwere otu iche.
But one fact seems to make more sense than anything else.	Ma otu eziokwu yiri ka ọ bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya karịa ihe niile.
I am enthusiastic.	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Ọ dịghị ihe ga-adị mma ma ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị ya.
I hope it will have the desired effect.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ ga-enwe mmetụta achọrọ.
Or anything you can think of.	Ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla ị nwere ike iche.
But there is a problem.	Ma enwere nsogbu.
One pair of shoes.	Otu ụzọ akpụkpọ ụkwụ.
She is looking for her husband.	Ọ na-achọ di ya.
Someone different to talk to.	Onye dị iche ịgwa ya okwu.
This works well.	Nke a na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Many parents love and cherish their children.	Ọtụtụ ndị nne na nna hụrụ ụmụ ha n'anya ma nwee obi ụtọ na ha nwere ha.
We have news for you.	Anyị nwere akụkọ maka gị.

Her doctors told her to rest.	Ndị dọkịta ya gwara ya ka ọ zuru ike.
Or you can let them know.	Ma ọ bụ ị ga-eme ka ha mara.
The pictures are beautiful.	Foto ndị ahụ mara mma.
Something told me it was.	Otu ihe gwara m na ọ nọ na ya.
I would have known it everywhere.	M gaara ama ya ebe ọ bụla.
She is scared when she sees him.	Ụjọ na-ama ya mgbe ọ hụrụ ya.
It is not something here but a house.	Ọ bụghị ihe ebe a ma ụlọ.
On one day of the week.	Na otu ụbọchị ezumike n'izu.
It's like the other one.	Ọ dị ka nke ọzọ.
They really thought they could be.	Ha chere n'ezie na ha nwere ike ịbụ.
Something similar is now important again.	Ihe yiri nke ahụ dị mkpa ugbu a ọzọ.
Everything is beautiful in this game.	Ihe niile mara mma na egwuregwu a.
None of this will succeed.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe a ga-aga nke ọma.
Everything seems to be going well.	Ihe niile dị ka ọ na-aga nke ọma.
It will continue.	Ọ ga-aga n'ihu.
There is no new way, of course.	Ọ dịghị ụzọ ọhụrụ ọ bụla, n'ezie.
Most of the second practice is at night.	Ọtụtụ n'ime omume nke abụọ bụ n'abalị.
We will continue.	Anyị ga-aga n'ihu.
He doesn't like the word.	Okwu ahụ anaghị amasị ya.
The man is a liar.	Nwoke ahụ bụ onye ụgha.
I am busy today.	Enwere m ọrụ n'aka taa.
My phone is small.	Ekwentị m dị ntakịrị.
I don’t think we spent the night there.	Echeghị m na anyị nọrọ abalị ebe ahụ.
So alive.	Ya mere dị ndụ.
Violence had begun.	Ime ihe ike malitere.
They need me for four months.	Ha chọrọ m ọnwa anọ.
All the books have the same name.	Akwụkwọ ndị ahụ niile nwere otu aha.
The moon was ahead of them.	Ọnwa dị n'ihu ha ka ha na-aga.
But it’s not just work.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị ọrụ.
That made me very happy.	Nke ahụ mere m nnọọ obi ụtọ.
The plan is the same.	Atụmatụ ahụ bụ otu ihe ahụ.
But this happened in one of my cases.	Ma ihe a mere n'otu n'ime ikpe m.
That should be the case.	Otú ahụ ka ọ kwesịrị ịdị.
It is still true that my behavior was not good.	Ọ ka bụ eziokwu na omume m adịghị mma.
This time is pointless.	Oge a enweghị isi.
This was achieved with music.	E ji egwu nweta nke a.
The children walk around in their bedclothes.	Ụmụaka na-eme njem n'ime akwa akwa ha.
That is what the doctor did.	Otú ahụ ka dọkịta ahụ mere.
There are many examples now.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe atụ ugbu a.
I'm not like this.	Adịghị m ka nke a.
I was hungry.	Agụụ juru m.
Something terrible.	Ihe dị oke egwu.
At such times, too.	N'oge dị otú a, kwa.
He is young, and he speaks fluently.	Ọ bụ nwata, ọ na-aga were were na-ekwu okwu.
I want her to be happy.	Achọrọ m ka ọ nwee obi ụtọ.
What happened today is unfortunate.	Ihe mere taa bụ ihe nwute.
Tell me how you do.	Gwa m ka ị na-eme.
I'm sorry about that.	Ọ dị m nwute maka nke a.
I do not know what happened.	Amaghị m ihe merenụ.
These days, it's actually a phone.	Ụbọchị ndị a, ọ bụ n'ezie otu ekwentị.
She has a dog.	O nwere nkịta.
It is not something he does.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọ na-eme.
However, you yourself are meaningless.	Otú ọ dị, gị onwe gị enweghị isi.
Now go the other way.	Ugbu a gaa n'ụzọ ọzọ.
I need some.	Achọrọ m ụfọdụ.
This year is a bad one.	Afọ a bụ ihe na-adịghị mma.
I am only 30 minutes away.	Adị m naanị nkeji iri atọ.
There is a light in the room.	Enwere ọkụ n'ime ụlọ.
You can not get out of it.	Ị nweghị ike isi na ya pụọ.
Naturally, you want to do well.	Dị ka o kwesịrị ịdị, ịchọrọ ime nke ọma.
What can be done?	Gịnị ka a pụrụ ime?
You have to move on.	Ị ga-aga n'ihu.
We can not know.	Anyị enweghị ike ịma.
Nothing will happen to him or the other person.	Ọ dịghị ihe ga-eme ya ma ọ bụ onye nke ọzọ.
But in some ways the challenge is fun.	Ma n'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ihe ịma aka ahụ bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
Not so.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
No one came.	Ọ dịghị onye bịara.
You just let them sit down together.	Naanị ị hapụrụ ha ka ha nọdụ ala ọnụ.
They are surprised.	O juru ha anya.
Because no one knows me.	N'ihi na ọ dịghị onye maara m.
No one saw it.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya.
Or it may be.	Ma ọ bụ ọ nwere ike.
This practice is the first of its kind.	Omume a bụ nke mbụ ụdị ya.
She is not a very beautiful woman.	Ọ bụghị nwanyị mara mma nke ukwuu.
The boy is not himself today.	Nwa nwoke ahụ abụghị onwe ya taa.
And this feature is the core of the story.	Na nke a mma bụ isi nke akụkọ.
This is like a school rule.	Nke a dị ka iwu ụlọ akwụkwọ.
He knows we have it.	Ọ maara na anyị nwere ya.
Very good quality.	Ezigbo mma n'ezie.
Take a job.	Were ọrụ.
This is sad and scary.	Nke a bụ ihe nwute na egwu.
We do nothing to help our situation.	Anyị anaghị eme ihe ọ bụla iji nyere ọnọdụ anyị aka.
They are not interested.	Ha enweghị mmasị.
I tried everything I could to stop him from leaving.	M gbalịrị ihe niile ka m kwụsị ya ịpụ.
Maybe immediately, maybe within a year.	Ma eleghị anya ozugbo, ma eleghị anya n'ime otu afọ.
Apparently it is the same again.	O doro anya na ọ dị otu a ọzọ.
But we like the way.	Ma anyị na-amasị ụzọ.
So he had a reason.	Ya mere o nwere ihe kpatara ya.
There is no way to know anything right now.	Enweghị ụzọ isi mara ihe ọ bụla n'ezie ugbu a.
But he wanted the food.	Ma ọ chọrọ nri ahụ.
He was almost insecure.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ na o nweghị obi ike.
What a fool, he thought.	Kedu onye nzuzu, o chere.
It went well.	Ọ gara nke ọma.
Obviously.	Nke doro anya.
Over and over again, he gained interest.	Ugboro ugboro, o nwetara mmasị ya.
Again, it is me.	Ọzọ, ọ bụ m.
I am tired.	Ike na-agba m.
Does he expect us to believe that?	Ọ̀ na-atụ anya ka anyị kwere nke ahụ?
Once you see it, it’s obvious.	Ozugbo ị hụrụ ya, o doro anya.
Something needs to be done.	Ekwesịrị ime ihe.
It is my job.	Ọ bụ ọrụ m.
Important thing to do.	Ihe dị mkpa ime.
His legs are the worst.	Ụkwụ ya kacha njọ.
Women love it, man.	Ụmụ nwanyị hụrụ ya n'anya, nwoke.
My meeting started a few minutes ago.	Nzukọ m malitere nkeji ole na ole gara aga.
This is impossible.	Nke a enweghị ike ime.
Weekends are fun, go places, hungry.	Ụbọchị izu ụka na-atọ ụtọ, gaa ebe, agụụ.
I want to talk to him.	Achọrọ m ịgwa ya okwu.
Only vacation is required.	Naanị ezumike ka ọ chọrọ.
That is very important for my book.	Nke ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa maka akwụkwọ m.
Enjoy the tree!	Enwe ka osisi!
I know you will not do anything stupid.	Ama m na ị gaghị eme ihe nzuzu.
This movie is scary.	Ihe nkiri a na-atụ ụjọ.
He has no good plans.	O nweghị ezigbo atụmatụ.
I will do this myself.	M ga-eme nke a n'onwe m.
He looked immediately.	O lere anya ozugbo.
I'm going to see him.	M na-aga ịhụ ya.
There are many reports of her sudden illness.	A na-ekwu ọtụtụ akụkọ banyere ọrịa mberede ya.
I am a man and a man.	Abụ m nwoke na mmadụ.
If it is, everyone will do it.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ, onye ọ bụla ga-eme ya.
The monkey tail is beautiful.	Ọdụ enwe mara mma.

I do not understand.	Aghọtaghị m.
When he spoke, we realized he was one of them.	Mgbe o kwuru okwu, anyị ghọtara na ọ bụ otu n’ime ha.
Once by heart, once by the side.	Otu ugboro site n'obi, otu ugboro n'akụkụ.
There is still room.	A ka nwere ohere.

But not as a person.	Ma ọ bụghị dị ka onye.

Big big big.	Nnukwu nnukwu nnukwu.
Obviously they can be perfect.	O doro anya na ha nwere ike zuru oke.
Most, very small.	Ọtụtụ, dị obere.
No study.	Enweghị ọmụmụ ihe.
You feel happy.	Ọ dị gị ka ị nwere obi ụtọ.
He was angry.	Iwe were ya.
We do this in two ways.	Anyị na-eme nke a n'ụzọ abụọ.

He seemed to be wondering how to tell me.	O yiri ka ọ̀ nọ na-eche otú ọ ga-esi gwa m.
Prices are really high.	Ọnụ ahịa dị elu n'ezie.

Delicious lunch was provided.	E nyere nri ehihie dị ụtọ.

Someone has no idea what’s going on.	Ọ nwere onye nwere echiche ọ bụla maka ihe na-eme.

There is a special lack of interest.	Enwere enweghị mmasị pụrụ iche.

Wine and dinner at the same time.	Mmanya na nri abalị na otu mgbe.

We are not the judges.	Anyị abụghị ndị ikpe.
I can't see it right now.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ya ugbu a.
She injects herself every day.	Ọ na-agba onwe ya ọgwụ kwa ụbọchị.
The fact is that this man can play.	Nke bụ eziokwu bụ na nwoke a nwere ike igwu egwu.
We will use these two methods.	Anyị ga-eji ụzọ abụọ a.
He is telling the truth.	Ọ na-ekwu eziokwu.

But not just any book.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị akwụkwọ ọ bụla.
That is not a problem here.	Nke ahụ abụghị nsogbu ebe a.
The awesome horror horror horror.	Ndị egwu egwu egwu egwu egwu egwu.
How can we sit still and do nothing.	Kedu ka anyị ga-esi nọdụ ala emeghị ihe ọ bụla.
He eventually took this as his biggest vacation.	O mechara were nke a dị ka nnukwu ezumike ya.
Most of our clients are people of their age.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị ahịa anyị bụ ndị mmadụ n'afọ ha.

He’s going to play like that.	Ọ ga-esi na-egwu egwu otu ahụ.
Of course, we do not exist.	N'ezie, anyị adịghị adị.
His anger blazed quickly.	Iwe ya were ọkụ ngwa ngwa.
They do not need that body.	Ha adịghị mkpa na ahụ.
You got to play me, you make me famous.	Ị nwetara m egwu egwu, ị na-eme ka m bụrụ onye a ma ama.
He made sense, in his own way.	O mere ezi uche, n'ụzọ ya.

Thanks so much for a delicious lunch my friends.	Daalụ nke ukwuu maka nri ehihie na-atọ ụtọ ndị enyi m.

You told me he understood.	Ị gwara m na ọ ghọtara ya.
Its benefits are worthwhile.	Uru ya bara uru.

Of course, we do not like that.	N'ezie, nke ahụ adịghị amasị anyị.

I think this is great.	Echere m na nke a dị oke mma.
But there was no fire.	Ma ọkụ adịghị.
And that, but not at all.	Na nke ahụ, ma ọ bụghị n'ihe niile.
Food works.	Nri na-arụ ọrụ.
It does not happen immediately.	Ọ naghị eme ozugbo.
At that time, the night fell.	N'oge ahụ, abalị dara.
Now we know why.	Ugbu a, anyị maara ihe kpatara ya.
Unsurprisingly like a fisherman.	Na-enweghị isi dị ka onye ọkụ azụ.

There would have been time for such a talk.	A gaara enwe oge maka okwu dị otú ahụ.
They are not the cause.	Ọ bụghị ha kpatara ya.
She wore a police uniform and looked beautiful.	O yi uwe ojii wee were onwe ya mara mma.
This is another idea, by the way.	Nke a bụ echiche ọzọ, n'agbanyeghị.
They go.	Ha na-aga.
It's about my family.	Ọ bụ gbasara ezinụlọ m.
We need financial help.	Anyị chọrọ enyemaka ego.
The company has others.	Ụlọ ọrụ nwere ndị ọzọ.

Sometimes it is better to move on.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ ka mma ịga n'ihu.
Bad weather interrupted their message.	Ihu igwe ọjọọ kwụsịrị ozi ha.
It’s just something that bothers me.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe na-eme m uche.

On the track there is a break.	Na egwu ahụ enwere ezumike.
He does not know me.	Ọ dịghị ama m.

The point is, we would never know that.	Isi ihe bụ na anyị agaghị ama nke ahụ.
So they say.	Ya mere, ha na-ekwu.
Because of feelings.	N'ihi mmetụta.
That's where you come from.	Nke ahụ bụ ebe i si bịa.

People seem to want more than they want.	O yiri ka ndị mmadụ chọrọ karịa ihe ha chọrọ.

That may be fine, it may not be.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịdị mma, ọ nwere ike ọ gaghị adị.
Fast forward just four months ago.	Ngwa ngwa ngwa naanị ọnwa anọ gara aga.
You can.	Ị nwere ike.

But many.	Ma ọtụtụ ndị.
You have a plan.	Ị nwere atụmatụ.
So it is not cheap.	N'ihi ya, ọ bụghị ọnụ ala.
He wanted to do more than that.	Ọ chọrọ ime ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
He’s playing fish.	Ọ na-egwu azụ.
But there is no way that it can be true.	Mana ọ nweghị ụzọ ọ ga-esi bụrụ eziokwu.
They are very friendly.	Ha nwere nnọọ enyi.

Not that day.	Ọ bụghị ụbọchị ahụ.
My mother.	Nne nke m.
The reporters asked the president a long question.	Ndị nta akụkọ ahụ jụrụ onye isi ala ajụjụ ogologo oge.
I will go to the back door.	M ga-aga n'ọnụ ụzọ azụ.
Shall we go to dinner?	Anyị ga-aga nri abalị?
Men's rights.	Ikike nke ụmụ nwoke.
Then he left.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ pụrụ.
It looks like real leather, your body doesn't know it isn't.	Ọ dị ka ezigbo akpụkpọ anụ, ahụ gị amaghị na ọ bụghị.
I need essential.	Achọrọ m mkpa mkpa.
He was suddenly happy.	Obi dị ya ụtọ na mberede.
Speaking of feelings.	Na-ekwu ihe maka mmetụta.
The study is still going on today.	Ọmụmụ ka na-aga n'ihu taa.
Everything I need is important.	Ihe m niile dị mkpa.
I'm very sorry.	Ọ dị m nwute nke ukwuu.
We are going.	Anyị na-aga.
I have it in my ear.	Enwere m ya na ntị m.
Maybe they were right.	Ma eleghị anya, ha kwuru eziokwu.
They are constantly moving forward.	Ha na-aga n'ihu mgbe niile.
This is a story.	Nke a bụ akụkọ.
Otherwise, it’s time to find a new movie.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ bụ oge ịchọta ihe nkiri ọhụrụ.
Again, thanks.	Ọzọ, daalụ.
Take the last one.	Were nke ikpeazụ.
I'm sure you like travel.	Eji m n'aka na njem na-amasị gị.
He had his back with another police officer.	O nwere azụ ya na onye uwe ojii ọzọ.
In small.	Na obere.
But no one wants to be there for her.	Ma ọ dịghị onye ọ bụla chọrọ ịbụ maka ya.
No one expected it.	Ọ dịghị onye tụrụ anya ya.
This city has a long history.	Obodo a nwere ogologo akụkọ ihe mere eme.
The meeting was a success.	Nzukọ ahụ gara nke ọma.
But you will not see it.	Ma ị gaghị ahụ ya.
They were badly burned.	A gbara ha ọkụ nke ukwuu.
It seems that many others do not have access to a hospital.	Ọ dị ka ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ enweghị ohere ụlọ ọgwụ.
A fire broke out at the port.	Ọkụ gbara n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
It’s just school.	Ọ bụ naanị ụlọ akwụkwọ.
No one really says that.	Ọ dịghị onye na-ekwu otú ahụ n'ezie.
He spoke the truth to power.	O kwuru eziokwu nye ike.
They knew that they would not let anyone take what they had.	Ha ma na ha agaghị ekwe ka onye ọ bụla were ihe ha nwere.
But the money will come from nowhere.	Mana ego ahụ ga-esi n'ebe ọ bụla bịa.
Today, however, it surprises me.	Otú ọ dị, taa, ọ tụrụ m n'anya.
Someone called him and told him the company was on fire.	Otu onye kpọrọ ya gwa ya na ụlọ ọrụ ahụ na-agba ọkụ.
No, no, no.	Mba, mba, mba.
Both are important.	Ha abụọ dị mkpa.
His diet helped with his condition.	Nri ya nyere aka na ọnọdụ ya.
This woman is responsible for the success of this project.	Nwanyị a bụ maka ihe ịga nke ọma nke ọrụ a.
It is not a feast.	Ọ bụghị oriri.
A woman should not say her age.	Nwanyị ekwesịghị ikwu afọ ndụ ya.
But no men.	Ma ọ dịghị ụmụ nwoke.
Eat right now.	Na-eri ihe ugbu a.
This is like the other problem.	Nke a dị ka nsogbu nke ọzọ.
Help is needed in this.	Achọrọ enyemaka na nke a.
But it is impossible.	Ma ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
I am hungry, everything.	Agụụ na-agụ m, ihe niile.
These are things he knows.	Ihe ndị a bụ ihe ọ maara.
He would never have felt so powerful.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-enwe mmetụta dị ike otú ahụ.
They are very strong.	Ha siri ezigbo ike.
Winter is coming quickly.	Oge oyi na-abịa ngwa ngwa.
He told us to sing.	Ọ gwara anyị ka anyị bụrụ abụ.
Four others were angry with him.	Mmadụ anọ ndị ọzọ were ya iwe.
The other one no one seems to hold.	Nke ọzọ ọ dịghị onye yiri ka o ji.
We saw them before they saw us.	Anyị hụrụ ha tupu ha ahụ anyị.
You will help.	Ị ga-enyere aka.
Me, too, at that time.	Mụ onwe m kwa, n'oge ahụ.
That’s pretty much it.	Nke ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
That is not the case.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
Obviously not good.	O doro anya na ọ dịghị mma.
In bad weather, stay home.	Na ihu igwe ọjọọ, nọrọ n'ụlọ.
It can take me a lifetime.	O nwere ike were m oge ndụ m niile.
There will always be.	A ga-enwe mgbe niile.
I can't tell you right now.	Enweghị m ike ịgwa gị ugbu a.
We love the house.	Anyị hụrụ ụlọ ahụ n'anya.
Get a bed.	Nweta akwa.
It is his first example.	Ọ bụ ihe atụ mbụ ya.
I think he was smart.	Echere m na ọ bụ na ọ maara ihe.
That will not be easy.	Nke ahụ agaghị adị mfe.
But it is difficult to do.	Ma ọ bụ ihe siri ike ime.
This will be different this time around, though.	Nke a ga-adị iche n'oge a, n'agbanyeghị.
He obviously does not buy.	O doro anya na ọ naghị azụ ihe.
The insects are small.	Ụmụ ahụhụ ahụ dị obere.
The work of a hard worker.	Ọrụ onye ọrụ siri ike.
But they are there.	Ma ha nọ ebe ahụ.
But now my words.	Ma ugbu a ka okwu m.
Your hand is just what happened.	Aka gị dị nnọọ ihe merenụ.
Whether it works for them or not.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka ha ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị.
It was almost too much, for some reason.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ nke ukwuu, n'ihi ihe ụfọdụ.
These trees need a lot of light.	Osisi ndị a chọrọ nnukwu ọkụ.
Here, nothing else matters.	N'ebe a, ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ dị mkpa.
But he did.	Ma otú ahụ ka o mere.
He just wanted to talk.	Ọ chọrọ naanị ikwu okwu.
Because of his story.	N'ihi akụkọ ya.
There are no legal reports.	O nweghị akụkọ gbasara iwu.
I do not see how you can be expected.	Ahụghị m ka a ga-esi atụ anya gị.
To his mother.	Nye nne ya.
It is the best room in the restroom.	Ọ bụ ọnụ ụlọ kacha mma n'ụlọ ezumike.
I can't say more.	Enweghị m ike ikwu ọzọ.
It is early in the morning, so there is still time.	Ọ bụ n'isi ụtụtụ, ya mere a ka nwere oge.
It is a real problem.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nsogbu.
The hospital is on the old side.	Ụlọ ọgwụ ahụ dị n'akụkụ nke ochie.
But she felt beautiful.	Ma o chere na ọ mara mma.
He looked at his watch.	Ọ lere anya na elekere aka ya.
He did not know that he would do so.	Ọ maghị na ọ ga-eme otú ahụ.
I want to know how he did it.	Achọrọ m ịma ka o si mee ya.
It’s nice to see a famous face.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ ihu ama ama.
So he is still here.	Ya mere ọ ka nọ ebe a.
That seems logical.	Nke ahụ yiri ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
This can be done in a variety of ways.	Enwere ike ime nke a n'ụzọ dị iche iche.
The food did not taste good.	Nri ndị ahụ enweghị ụtọ.
We do not want anyone to believe us.	Anyị achọghị ka onye ọ bụla kwere na anyị.
Because we have.	N'ihi na anyị nwere.
He said that he really hated her.	O kwuru n'ezie na ya kpọrọ ya asị.
But one and the other were right.	Ma otu na ndị ọzọ kwuru eziokwu.
The theater was packed.	Ụlọ ihe nkiri ahụ juru n'ọnụ.
In this case, however, it would be quite different.	Otú ọ dị, na nke a, ọ ga-abụ ihe dị nnọọ iche.
What is debt.	Gịnị bụ ụgwọ.
Then it was their boat that caught fire.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ bụ ụgbọ mmiri ha gbara ọkụ.
My friend put everything together to tell her.	Enyi m tinyere ihe niile ka ọ gwa ya.
This seems like a very useful job.	Nke a dị ka ọrụ bara ezigbo uru.
Something is happening to the girl.	Ọ dị ihe na-eme nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
He would not love me, of course.	Ọ gaghị ahụ m n'anya, n'ezie.
I do not know where the character came from here.	Amaghị m ebe agwa ahụ si ebe a.
I don’t want to have a man in my life.	Enweghị m mmasị inwe nwoke na ndụ m.
Always, eating near the theater.	Mgbe niile, na-eri nri n'akụkụ ụlọ ihe nkiri.
More than that.	Karịa nke ahụ.
You may not want to know.	O nwere ike ị gaghị achọ ịma.
I want to make sure it will be the best it can be.	Achọrọ m ịhụ na ọ ga-abụ ihe kacha mma ọ nwere ike.
Something else happens.	Ihe ọzọ na-eme.
Bad things will happen.	Ihe ọjọọ ga-eme.
I do not know what to do!	Amaghị m ihe m ga-eme!
I am not a psychiatrist.	Abụghị m dọkịta uche.
We know how they look.	Anyị maara otú ha dị.
He liked the beautiful woman's face.	Ihu nwanyị ahụ mara mma masịrị ya.
It is not easy to find what you are looking for.	Ọ dịghị mfe ịchọta ihe masịrị gị.
You can do more than that.	Ị nwere ike ime ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
You don't make a man young.	Ị naghị eme nwoke ka nwata.
Playing high will do.	Igwu elu ga-eme.
No legs, well, not perfect.	O nweghị ụkwụ, nke ọma, ọ bụghị nke zuru oke.
The problem is its price.	Nsogbu ahụ bụ ọnụ ahịa ya.
Our old church is still alive.	Ụka ochie anyị ka dị ndụ.
Very strong.	Dị nnọọ ike.
I think it's awesome.	Echere m na ọ dị egwu.
For some reason they never did.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ ọ dịghị mgbe ha mere.
The windows in this house are made of glass.	E ji enyo mee windo ndị dị n'ụlọ a.
He was just himself.	Ọ bụ naanị onwe ya.
Cost to help me.	Ọnụ ego iji nyere m aka.
We're glad you're wearing your little dress.	Obi dị anyị ụtọ na ị yi obere uwe gị.
And also, the one who loves it.	Na kwa, onye hụrụ ya n'anya.
There is no help for it.	Enweghị enyemaka maka ya.
It was like a little game we were playing.	Ọ dị ka obere egwuregwu anyị na-egwu.
He knows how to cook well.	Ọ ma esi esi nke ọma.
But that would have been a really scary name.	Mana nke ahụ gaara abụ aha dị egwu n'ezie.
This is up to us.	Nke a dị anyị n'aka.
It is rare to have both.	Ọ dị obere ka ị nwere ha abụọ ọnụ.
Hope they are different from my body.	Olileanya na ha bụ ihe dị iche na ahụ m.
We are in trouble here.	Anyị nọ na nsogbu ebe a.
This is the place to be.	Nke a bụ ebe ịnọ.
These things are very tasty.	Ihe ndị a dị nnọọ ụtọ.
He will be a friend for a long time to come.	Ọ ga-abụ enyi ruo ogologo oge n'ihu.
But, simply put, it doesn't work.	Mana, n'ụzọ dị mfe, ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
None of those things went to home help.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị ahụ gara enyemaka ụlọ.
He left.	Ọ pụọ.
He left quickly.	Ọ hapụrụ ngwa ngwa.
But you are at your last chance.	Mana ị nọ na ohere ikpeazụ gị.
We can.	Anyị pụrụ.
You never know.	Ị gaghị ama.
I liked some of this.	Ụfọdụ n'ime nke a masịrị m.
I want to do it again.	Achọrọ m ime ya ọzọ.
Now if you have to come this way.	Ugbu a ọ bụrụ na ị ga-abịa n'ụzọ a.
It made me want to sleep.	O mere ka m chọọ ịma mmadụ ụra.
It doesn’t work for any of us.	Ọ naghị arụ ọrụ maka onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị.
It was deployed at the port.	E tinyere ya n'ọrụ na ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri.
He met her suddenly in the morning.	Ọ zutere ya n'ụtụtụ na mberede.
We ourselves are the only thing.	Anyị onwe anyị bụ naanị ihe dị.
I don't like it.	Ọ naghị adị m mma.
How much does this story have?	agwa ole ka akụkọ a nwere?
I am scared.	Ụjọ na-atụ m.
She is alone in the other room.	Ọ nọ naanị n'ọnụ ụlọ nke ọzọ.
But it is cold.	Ma oyi na-atụ.
This is where the person left you.	Ebe a ka onye ahụ hapụrụ gị.
Nothing here is old.	Ọ dịghị ihe ebe a mere ochie.
It is a very different life.	Ọ bụ ndụ dị nnọọ iche.
He came to me then.	Ọ bịara m mgbe ahụ.
These varieties are delicious.	Ụdị dị iche iche a na-atọ ụtọ.
Another holiday season for food.	Oge ezumike ọzọ maka ihe oriri.
I saw it.	Ahụrụ m ya.
The question is whether it is true.	Ajụjụ bụ ma ọ̀ bụ eziokwu.
It does not seem to work.	O yighị ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
This city is smaller than the village.	Obodo a dị ntakịrị karịa obodo nta.
He should have a friend.	Ọ bụ enyi kwesịrị inwe.
We do not know much.	Anyị amaghị ọtụtụ ihe.
He suggested I go here.	Ọ tụrụ aro ka m gaa ebe a.
The river is cold.	Osimiri dị oyi.
Transportation here is good.	Ụgbọ njem ebe a dị mma.
No family history is important.	Enweghị akụkọ ihe mere eme ezinụlọ dị mkpa.
But you have to go on your own.	Mana ị ga-eji ụkwụ nke aka gị pụọ.
He was angry.	O were iwe.
For four years.	Ruo afọ anọ.
We are still many.	Anyị ka bụ ọtụtụ.
It is my job.	Ọ bụ ọrụ m.
This is not easy, but the practice is doing well.	Nke a adịghị mfe, mana omume na-eme nke ọma.
I do not understand how.	Aghọtaghị m otú.
It is no different than being home then.	Ọ bụghị ihe dị iche na ịnọ n'ụlọ mgbe ahụ.
Maybe he doesn't like it.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ naghị amasị ya.
At first we felt we did not know where we were going.	Na mbụ ọ dị anyị ka anyị amaghị ebe anyị ga-aga.
Therefore, constant energy will be needed.	Ya mere, ike mgbe niile ga-adị mkpa.
But easy to do.	Ma dị mfe ime.
Sometimes it works.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
That's when he hit the ball hard.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka ọ tụrụ bọọlụ nke ọma.
The water is very clear.	Mmiri ahụ doro anya nke ọma.
It seems to have its value together.	Ọ dị ka o nwere ọnụ ahịa ya ọnụ.
That's it.	Ọ bụ ya.
This is the third test.	Nke a bụ ule nke atọ.
Talk to someone.	Gwa mmadụ okwu.
This is very close.	Nke a dị nnọọ nso.
The trees had leaves.	Osisi ndị ahụ nwere akwụkwọ.
Soon, all the sailors arrived there to dance.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri niile rutere ebe ahụ ịgba egwu.
There was fear then.	Ụjọ dị mgbe ahụ.
This dog needs a good home.	Nkịta a chọrọ ezigbo ụlọ.
Of course not.	N'ezie, anyị emeghị.
The important thing is that we understand each other very well.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ na anyị ghọtara ibe anyị nke ọma.
This is not true.	Nke a abụghị eziokwu.
We bought two.	Anyị zụtara abụọ.
It is an important task.	Ọ bụ ọrụ dị mkpa.
There will be no available room.	A gaghị enwe ọnụ ụlọ dị.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
Righteousness along the bed continues.	Ezi omume n'akụkụ akwa na-aga n'ihu.
Otherwise, we have what we have.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, anyị nwere ihe anyị nwere.
We both know and feel that there is something else.	Anyị ma mara ma na-eche na e nwere ihe ọzọ.
Make up your mind.	Mee echiche.

You can make room.	Ị nwere ike ime ụlọ.
All of these things are good to do in your life.	Ihe ndị a niile dị mma ime na ndụ gị.
Everything is given.	Ihe niile e nyere.
Dinner will be ready soon.	Nri abalị ga-adị njikere n'oge adịghị anya.
Make it a game for yourself.	Mee ya ka ọ bụrụ egwuregwu maka onwe gị.
He played a game.	Ọ tụrụ otu egwuregwu.
He thought he did it.	O chere na ya mere ya.
That’s hard money.	Nke ahụ bụ ego siri ike.
I see you will need help.	Ahụrụ m na ị ga-achọ enyemaka.

I was looking for a job every day but had no success.	Ana m achọ ọrụ kwa ụbọchị mana enweghị ihe ịga nke ọma ọ bụla.
The case lasted two weeks.	Okwu a were izu abụọ.
But now he knows what it is.	Ma ugbu a, ọ mara ihe ọ bụ.
We value that.	Anyị ji nke ahụ kpọrọ ihe.
But it is so.	Ma otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
It's really quick and easy.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ngwa ngwa na mfe.
And who could be, you say.	Na onye nwere ike ịbụ, ị na-ekwu.
It will happen, it will happen, it happens.	Ọ ga-eme, ọ ga-eme, ọ na-eme.
It's something else.	Ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.

It's anonymous, he said.	Ọ bụ ihe amaghị aha, o kwuru.
That’s a lot of things.	Nke ahụ bụ ọtụtụ ihe.
You do not water us.	Ị naghị atụ anyị mmiri.

There is nothing that can be done about it right now.	O nweghị ihe a ga-eme ya ugbu a.
But he is mostly a foodie.	Mana ọ kacha bụrụ onye na-eri nri.
For one reason the reason is simple.	Maka otu ihe kpatara ya dị mfe.

The water surrounded the boat.	Mmiri gbara ụgbọ mmiri ahụ gburugburu.
To not the best just because.	Iji abụghị ihe kacha mma naanị n'ihi na.
He went barefoot for 40 years.	Ọ gara enweghị akpụkpọ ụkwụ ruo afọ iri anọ.
Work is work.	Ọrụ bụ ọrụ.

Thank you, thank you.	Daalụ, daalụ.

The only thing I can give someone is myself now.	Naanị ihe m nwere ike inye mmadụ bụ onwe m ugbu a.
Nothing makes sense.	Ọ dịghị ihe nwere uche.

He can do it.	O nwere ike ime ya.
The workers were terrified.	Ndị ọrụ were oke ụjọ.

That's not fair.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma.
He didn’t want to know how it was done, just that it was.	Ọ chọghị ịma otú e si mee ya, naanị na ọ dị.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
So he is a good boy.	Ya mere ọ bụ ezigbo nwa nwoke.
I hear it again.	Ana m anụ ya ọzọ.
At any cost.	Na ụgwọ ọ bụla.
Two of them said no.	Abụọ n'ime ha kwuru na ha abụghị.
But this is more than a challenge.	Ma nke a karịrị ihe ịma aka.
Stories of some kind.	Akụkọ ụdị ụfọdụ.
There is nothing wrong with me.	O nweghị ihe ọjọọ dị m.

The water is cold but it looks fresh.	Mmiri ahụ dị oyi mana ọ dị ka ọ dị ọhụrụ.
Please buy his books.	Biko zụta akwụkwọ ya.
The father, as he went, said little.	Nna, ka ọ na-aga, kwuru ntakịrị.
I think he loves you a little.	Echere m na ọ hụrụ gị n'anya ntakịrị.
It has a solid color.	O nwere agba siri ike.
She became very ill.	Ahụ́ bịara dị ya nnọọ njọ.
If you have children, buy a mirror before swimming.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ụmụaka, zụta enyo enyo tupu igwu mmiri.
But he never spoke.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-ekwu okwu.
The family was amazed at what was said.	Ihe ndị a na-ekwu juru ezinụlọ ahụ anya.
I think this would have scared me.	Echere m na nke a gaara atụ m ụjọ.
Most are children or younger than children.	Ọtụtụ bụ ụmụaka ma ọ bụ obere karịa ụmụaka.
To him, law is law.	Nye ya, iwu bụ iwu.
Now it's easy to do.	Ugbu a ọ dị mfe ime.
And always, of violence.	Na mgbe ọ bụla, nke ime ihe ike.
They play football all year.	Ha na-agba bọọlụ n'afọ niile.
My team is a small crew.	Ndị otu m bụ obere ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri.
It happened while I was in school.	O mere n’oge m nọ n’ụlọ akwụkwọ.
He lived with his mother at that time.	Ya na nne ya bi n’oge ahụ.
It could have been her son.	O nwere ike ịbụ nwa ya nwoke.
Should be stronger than it is.	Kwesịrị ịdị ike karịa ka ọ dị.
We had our bad days but.	Anyị nwere ụbọchị ọjọọ anyị mana.
He is there!	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ!
His laughter was sudden and courageous.	Ọchị ya bụ mberede na obi ike.
There is nothing beautiful about it.	Ọ dịghị ihe mara mma banyere ya.
I do not want to upset you.	Achọghị m nwute gị.
But that should not be the case.	Ma nke ahụ ekwesịghị ịbụ.
So much for good news.	Nke ukwuu maka akụkọ ọma.
He knew he had to do something.	Ọ maara na o kwesịrị ime ihe.
Whatever they are.	Ihe ọ bụla ha bụ.
In a sense, it is.	N'otu echiche, ọ bụ.
Could not be my game plan.	Apụghị abụghị atụmatụ egwuregwu m.
So he waited a few more minutes, thinking about the situation.	Ya mere, o chere nkeji ole na ole ọzọ, na-eche banyere ọnọdụ ahụ.
That’s another thing.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọzọ.
Let your thoughts be known.	Mee ka a mara echiche gị.
He was hit by a car.	Ụgbọ ala gbara ya ọsọ.
But planning is not a good word for things.	Ma ime atụmatụ, abụghị okwu dị mma maka ihe dị iche iche.
And the judges.	Na ndị ikpe.
No one is going to do this in real life.	Ọ dịghị onye ga-eme nke a na ndụ n'ezie.
Speed ​​is everything.	Ọsọ bụ ihe niile.
It's more than happy.	Ọ bụ karịa obi ụtọ.
Let me know if that is the case.	Mee ka m mara ma ọ bụrụ nke ahụ.
He does it for a reason.	Ọ na-eme ihe ahụ n'ihi ihe kpatara ya.
Obviously this does not work.	O doro anya na nke a anaghị arụ ọrụ.
Nothing will happen.	Ọ dịghị ihe ga-eme.
You told me what you were looking for.	Ị gwara m ihe ị na-achọ.
What's worse is that he is still human.	Nke ka njọ bụ na ọ ka bụ mmadụ.
But we know that there is no hope.	Ma anyị maara na o nweghị olileanya.
He really knows what happened.	Ọ maara ihe mere n'ezie.
That's not fair.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma.
We did not.	Anyị emeghị.
It’s a job, it’s a job.	Ọ bụ ọrụ, ọ bụ ọrụ.
If they did.	Ọ bụrụ na ha mere.
This should be a fairy tale.	Nke a kwesịrị ịbụ akụkọ akụkọ.
The best is not always the best.	Nke kacha bụ ọ bụghị mgbe niile kacha mma.
I do not want his responsibility.	Achọghị m ibu ọrụ ya.
That is certainly so.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị n'ezie.
I do not see it.	Ahụghị m na ọ dị.
His work is small.	Ọrụ ya dị obere.
We do not know anyone.	Ọ dịghị onye anyị maara.
He’s trying to get better.	Ọ na-agbalị ka mma.
He made his film debut last month.	O mere ihe nkiri mbụ ya n'ọnwa gara aga.
There is no wallet at this time.	Enweghị obere akpa oge a.
This is how we go.	Otú a ka anyị ga-esi gaa.
Today, everyone does everything.	Taa, onye ọ bụla na-eme ihe niile.
Because it is not true.	N'ihi na ọ bụghị eziokwu.
Continue this until it is no longer possible.	Gaa n'ihu nke a ruo mgbe ọ gaghị ekwe omume ọzọ.
It is empty.	O nweghị ihe dị na ya.
We will go!	Anyị ga-aga!
He told me that he hated that.	Ọ gwara m na ya kpọrọ nke ahụ asị.
What made it special was the situation.	Ihe mere ka ọ pụọ iche bụ ọnọdụ ahụ.
We drove together.	Anyị gbara ụgbọ ọnụ.
They are all different.	Ha niile dị iche.
But at the cost.	Ma n'ọnụ ego.
The main cause of the problem itself.	Isi ihe kpatara nsogbu ahụ n'onwe ya.
I have ten children.	Enwere m ụmụaka iri.
Lots of new things in life, if that makes any sense.	Ọtụtụ ihe ọhụrụ na ndụ, ma ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ na-eme ka uche ọ bụla.
One is a matter of morals and the other is a matter of law.	Otu bụ okwu gbasara omume na nke ọzọ bụ okwu gbasara iwu.
He feared for his life.	Ọ tụrụ egwu maka ndụ ya.
They were people once, just a long time ago.	Ha bụ ndị mmadụ otu oge, naanị ogologo oge gara aga.
Clearly, they are not.	N'ụzọ doro anya, ha abụghị.
He rejected their offer.	Ọ jụrụ okwu ha.
We can get the best for me.	Anyị nwere ike nweta ihe kacha mma maka m.
She looked at her father.	O lere nna ya anya.
His head fell forward.	Isi ya dara n'ihu.
Just live like life.	Dị nnọọ ndụ ka ndụ.
Maybe you want to make it easier.	Ma eleghị anya, ịchọrọ ime ka ọ dị mfe.
I'm happy.	Enwere m obi ụtọ.
Maybe he went too fast.	Ma eleghị anya ọ gara oke ọsọ.
It's definitely a great game.	N'ezie ọ bụ nnukwu egwuregwu.
I can do that, he said.	Enwere m ike ime nke ahụ, o kwuru.
Help him.	Nye ya aka.
I do not know who these are.	Amaghị m ndị ndị a bụ.
We were scared.	Ụjọ tụrụ anyị.
I got it back.	M nwetara ya azụ.
There is a point.	Enwere isi.
This is what they did.	Nke a ka ha mere.
The workers live in rural areas.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ bi n'ime ime obodo.
His work is unknown.	Amaghị ọrụ ya.
I do not know what to do.	Amaghị m ihe m ga-eme n'ezie.
Locals said he was terrified of the whole country.	Ndị obodo ahụ kwuru na ọ tụrụ ụjọ na mba ahụ niile.
I am glad it stopped on my way.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ọ kwụsịrị n'ụzọ m.
Now is the time to act.	Ugbu a bụ oge ime ihe.
If you know anyone, let me know.	Ọ bụrụ na ị maara onye ọ bụla, mee ka m mara.
It was a new idea for me that year.	Ọ bụ echiche ọhụrụ nye m n'afọ ahụ.
I saw something wrong.	Ahụrụ m ihe na-adịghị mma.
It’s good, it’s good, it feels perfect.	Ọ dị mma, ọ dị mma, mmetụta zuru oke.
How wet is the road?	Kedu ka ụzọ ahụ si dị mmiri?
They have more time.	Ha nwere oge karịa.
Maybe it was an accident.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ihe mberede.
We can see it with them here.	Anyị na ha nwere ike ịhụ ya ebe a.
There are no civil servants in this country.	Enweghị ndị ọrụ obodo na obodo a.
That is very good.	Nke ahụ dị ezigbo mma.
You can find it in all the uncomfortable rooms.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ n'ime ụlọ niile na-adịghị mma.
He was young.	Ọ bụ nwata.
A special event took place this morning.	Ihe omume pụrụ iche mere n'ụtụtụ a.
Of course it is.	N'ezie ọ bụ.
It is very bad he does not know.	Ọ dị nnọọ njọ nke ukwuu ọ maghị.
All these days are beautiful.	Ụbọchị niile a mara mma.
It is easy to use.	Ọ dị mfe iji.
The house is very cold.	Ụlọ ahụ dị ezigbo oyi.
I love the dress.	Ahụrụ m uwe ahụ n'anya.
My brother went to work in another country.	Nwanne m nwoke gara ọrụ ná mba ọzọ.
Time is of the essence here.	Oge dị oke mkpa ebe a.
It is better today.	Ọ ka mma taa.
These are the people of the city.	Ndị a bụ ndị obodo ahụ.
I mean, not so well.	M na-ekwu, ọ bụghị nke ọma.
It's not easy.	Ọ dịghị mfe.
This old house needs a new roof.	Ụlọ ochie a chọrọ elu ụlọ ọhụrụ.
No further forward.	Enweghị anya n'ihu.
For me, that is.	Maka m, ya bụ.
It's very simple, of course.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe, n'ezie.
You and the others did not see anything.	Gị na ndị ọzọ ahụghị m ihe ọ bụla.
At the same time, he heard it behind him.	N'otu oge ahụ, ọ nụrụ ya n'azụ ya.
Together, we can make this happen.	Anyị ọnụ, anyị nwere ike ime ka nke a mee.
That is his job.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ ya.
This does not work.	Nke a anaghị arụ ọrụ.
I met him a few days ago.	Mụ na ya zutere ụbọchị ole na ole gara aga.
This is a good old thing.	Nke a bụ ezigbo ihe ochie.
In practice, no.	Na omume, mba.
A beautiful dress.	Uwe mara mma mara mma.
You’re just another man who fears promise.	Ị bụ naanị nwoke ọzọ na-atụ egwu nkwa.
He went to the door.	Ọ gara n'ọnụ ụzọ.
The problem is that this does not work.	Nsogbu bụ na nke a anaghị arụ ọrụ.
So phone users can use it.	Ya mere ndị ọrụ ekwentị nwere ike iji ya.
They have no power, or no power.	Ha enweghị ike, ma ọ bụ enweghị ike.
This is a lie.	Ihe a na-ekwu bụ ụgha.
And here is the most delicious.	Na ebe a bụ ihe kacha atọ ụtọ.
No, take it as a test.	Mba, were ya dị ka ule.
Just be ready to drive.	Dị nnọọ njikere ịnya ụgbọ ala.
I think I really liked it.	M chere na ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu.
Bad for others.	Ihe na-adịghị mma maka ndị ọzọ.
We did this as follows.	Anyị mere nke a dị ka ndị a.
You did well.	I mere ihe ọma.
It’s a great place to work.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ebe a na-arụ ọrụ.
It really does happen.	Ọ na-eme n'ezie.

Everything happens.	Ihe niile na-eme.
Now it is different.	Ugbu a ọ dị iche.
Thank you so much !!.	Daalụ nke ukwuu!!.
Not by accident.	Ọ bụghị na mberede.
But this is really the most important.	Ma nke a bụ n'ezie nke kacha mkpa.
But the second.	Ma nke abụọ.
He was angry and angry.	Iwe were ya were iwe.
Parents should tell their children daily.	Ndị nne na nna kwesịrị ịgwa ụmụ ha ihe kwa ụbọchị.
This is a man who can do anything.	Nke a bụ nwoke nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla n'ezie.
He really liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
Some times are good, though.	Oge ụfọdụ dị mma, n'agbanyeghị.
Another similar accident happened today.	Ihe mberede ọzọ dị otú ahụ mere taa.
He gave her time to plan.	O nyere ya oge ime atụmatụ.
I like the movie.	Enwere m mmasị na ihe nkiri ahụ.
Too much water to go swimming.	Mmiri dị oke mmiri ịga igwu mmiri.
They can not swim.	Ha enweghị ike igwu mmiri.
For now, get your vacation, you will want it.	Maka ugbu a, nweta ezumike gị, ị ga-achọ ya.
Hate anything.	Ịkpọ ihe ọ bụla asị.

Have a good time.	Nwee ezigbo oge.
The angels would not have needed such a thing.	Ọ dịghị mkpa dị otú ahụ a gaara adị ndị mmụọ ozi.
People want to go their own way.	Ndị mmadụ chọrọ ịga n'ụzọ nke ha.
We need to talk.	Anyị kwesịrị ikwu okwu.
I am one.	Abụ m otu.
He would have reported it to the police.	Ọ gaara agwa ya ndị uwe ojii.
He did a few things, but not many.	O mere ihe ole na ole, ma ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ihe.
Someone is joking.	Mmadụ na-ekwu ihe ọchị.
I walk by his side.	M na-aga n'akụkụ ya.
He loved his family, his parents, and his brother.	Ọ hụrụ ezinụlọ ya n'anya, ndị mụrụ ya na nwanne ya nwoke.
I could not stay longer.	Enweghị m ike ịnọ obere oge.
The students spent a long birthday.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ahụ nọrọ ogologo ụbọchị ọmụmụ.
His mother said she loved him.	Nne ya kwuru na ya hụrụ ya n'anya.
What is real is the time now.	Ihe dị adị bụ oge ugbu a.
The store has a number of products.	Ụlọ ahịa ahụ nwere ọtụtụ ngwa ahịa.
It seems different.	O yiri ka ọ dị iche.
We are all doing well.	Anyị niile na-eme nke ọma.
I am the problem.	Abụ m nsogbu ahụ.
They’re going to be long, of course.	Ha ga-adị ogologo ogologo, n'ezie.
Now it is not so.	Ugbu a, ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
There are a few things.	Enwere ihe ole na ole.
He did more than these.	O mere ihe karịrị ihe ndị a.
He wants to do it.	Ọ chọrọ ime ya.
The car is still there.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ ka nọ ebe ahụ.
He lives in the countryside.	O bi n'ime obodo.
Being here is my ability.	Ịdị adị m bụ ikike m.
All of this is not always possible.	Ihe ndị a niile anaghị ekwe omume mgbe niile.
The car as it comes from the store.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ dị ka ọ si n'ụlọ ahịa na-abịa.
Everything makes everything beautiful.	Ihe na-eme ihe niile mara mma.
he thought.	o chere.
I saw it.	Ahụrụ m ya anya.
It seems to be different from that and it is, because it is different.	O yiri ka ọ dị iche na nke ahụ ma bụrụ, n'ihi na ọ dị iche.
He is my dog.	Ọ bụ nkịta m.
He stopped, thinking.	Ọ kwụsịrị, na-eche echiche.
I run it with your mom sometimes.	Ana m agba ya na nne gị mgbe ụfọdụ.
Soon he entered the room.	N'oge na-adịghị, ọ banyere n'ime ụlọ.
I kept looking for my clothes.	M gara n'ihu na-achọ uwe m.
No, it is not possible.	Mba, ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
Most likely that.	O yikarịrị ka nke ahụ.
But its small harbor runs day and night.	Ma obere ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ya na-agba ehihie na abalị.
My parents understood.	Nne na nna m ghọtara.
I have nothing in this game.	Enweghị m ihe ọ bụla dị n'ime egwuregwu a.
He knows, not me.	Ọ maara, ọ bụghị m.
Has anyone else found this for a long time ?.	Ọ nwere onye ọzọ nwetara nke a maka ogologo oge a?.
But it is almost universal.	Ma ọ bụ ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ mmadụ niile.
They both still have limits on what they can do.	Ha abụọ ka nwere oke n'ihe ha nwere ike ime.
Maybe, maybe not.	Ma eleghị anya, ma eleghị anya ọ bụghị.
She will always be your daughter.	Ọ ga-abụ nwa gị nwanyị mgbe niile.
We always travel here.	Anyị na-eme njem mgbe niile ebe a.
No, they are not good at all, not many.	Mba, ha adịghị mma ma ọlị, ọ bụghị ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
He told me about it.	Ọ gwara m gbasara ya.
It does not work well.	Ọ naghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
My wife is one.	Nwunye m bụ otu.
He knew nothing about anything else.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ bụla banyere ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
Now it will be difficult.	Ugbu a ọ ga-esi ike.
The situation was emotional for both of them.	Ọnọdụ ahụ bụ ihe mmetụta uche nye ha abụọ.
Something like them.	Ihe dị ka ha dị.
I don't know why, but that's what they called it.	Amaghị ihe kpatara ya, mana nke ahụ bụ ihe ha kpọrọ ya.
He has an awesome name.	O nwere aha dị egwu.
Thanks for seeing !.	Daalụ maka ịhụ!.
It is difficult to find a good position.	O siri ike ịchọta ọnọdụ dị mma.
He did not want one.	Ọ chọghị otu.
This is not just a matter of morality.	Nke a abụghị naanị okwu gbasara omume ọma.
I saw their eyes at first, their eyes were different.	Ahụrụ m anya ha na mbụ, anya ha dị iche iche.
First, go get yourself a new phone.	Mbụ, gaa nweta onwe gị ekwentị ọhụrụ.
Just see you.	Naanị hụ gị.
He played a lot of games in his first season.	Ọ gbara ọtụtụ egwuregwu na oge mbụ.
I will look forward to seeing you.	Aga m atụ anya gị.
You need both.	Ị chọrọ ha abụọ.
We will do that every day.	Anyị ga-eme nke ahụ kwa ụbọchị.
Or so it is sometimes.	Ma ọ bụ otú ahụ ka ọ dị, mgbe ụfọdụ.
Our job is not to drive their cars.	Ọrụ anyị abụghị ịnya ụgbọ ala ha.
Then up again.	Mgbe ahụ elu ọzọ.
But it is very dangerous.	Mana ọ dị oke egwu.
It will get easier over time.	Ọ ga-adị mfe ka oge na-aga.
I suggest staying here.	M na-atụ aro ka m nọrọ ebe a.
'mother.	' nne.
Few people have that kind of life.	Ọ bụ mmadụ ole na ole nwere ụdị ndụ ahụ.
Why it should.	Gịnị mere o kwesịrị.
We can be in danger here.	Anyị nwere ike ịnọ n'ihe egwu ebe a.
Our spirit is positive.	Mmụọ anyị dị mma.
Can be traveled during the day or at night.	Enwere ike ime njem n'ehihie ma ọ bụ n'abalị.
One who is not afraid.	Onye na-adịghị atụ egwu ya.
I actually saw theirs.	Ahụrụ m nke ha n'ezie.
I need to be different.	M kwesịrị ịdị iche.
This cannot be true.	Nke a enweghị ike ịbụ eziokwu.
But the game went on for a long time.	Mana egwuregwu ahụ gara n'ihu ruo ogologo oge.
Life goes on.	Ndụ na-aga n'ihu.
Not for men and women.	Ọ bụghị maka nwoke na nwanyị.
You just have this feeling.	Naanị ị nwere mmetụta a.
Not his way.	Ọ bụghị ụzọ ya.
What he does, no one else does.	Ihe ọ na-eme, ọ dịghị onye ọzọ na-eme ya.
He needs a drink.	Ọ chọrọ ihe ọṅụṅụ.
One day, he will come.	Otu ụbọchị, ọ ga-abịa.
You are very valuable in place.	Ị bara oke uru na ebe.
There are a few exceptions.	Ọ nweghị ihe ole na ole.
That will be faster then.	Nke ahụ ga-adị ngwa ngwa mgbe ahụ.
We drank and ate until they were full.	Anyị na-aṅụ ma rie ruo mgbe e juru ha.
But he never told me who he was.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe ọ gwara m onye ọ bụ.
We arrived at our destination for lunch.	Anyị rutere ebe anyị na-aga n'oge nri ehihie.
This is closer than he wants.	Nke a dị nso karịa ihe ọ chọrọ.
No parents have no rules.	Enweghị nne na nna enweghị iwu.
Our house is not the same if it is not.	Ụlọ anyị abụghị otu ihe ma ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị ya.
I am a wise man.	Abụ m nwoke maara ihe.
This only made matters worse.	Nke a mere ka ihe ka njọ.
You, on the other hand, are very different.	N'aka nke ọzọ, gị bụ ihe dị nnọọ iche.
As for the name, it is actually the same.	Banyere aha, ọ bụ n'ezie otu ihe ahụ.
These things are useful.	Ihe ndị a bara uru.
I do not like that.	Ihe ahụ adịghị m mma.
No doubt you did.	O doro anya na ị masịrị ya.
This is an old house.	Nke a bụ ụlọ ochie.
It is a simple word but bad for the spirit.	Ọ bụ okwu dị mfe ma ọ dị njọ maka mmụọ.
He knew he had to run.	Ọ ma na ya kwesịrị ịgba ọsọ.
But you have it.	Mana ị nwere ya.
I want it in life.	Achọrọ m ya na ndụ.
I was alone.	Anọ m naanị m.
We really want a picture of that.	Anyị chọrọ n'ezie foto nke ahụ.
Life does not happen the other way around.	Ndụ adịghị eme n'ụzọ ọzọ.
He did not seem to like what everyone thought.	O yighị ka o nweghị mmasị n'ihe onye ọ bụla chere.
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị.
Not the same thing.	Ọ bụghị otu ihe ahụ.
We need workers from rural areas.	Anyị chọrọ ndị ọrụ si n'ime ime obodo.
The beauty is worth it.	Mma ahụ bara uru.
A smile spread across his face.	Ọmụmụ ọnụ ọchị gbasara n'ihu ya.
He looked at the child.	O lere nwa ahụ anya.
But for the uninitiated, now you know it.	Ma maka ndị na-enweghị, ugbu a ị mara ya.
He can tell you those situations.	O nwere ike ịgwa gị ọnọdụ ndị ahụ.
Just the job.	Naanị ọrụ ahụ.
The legal implications of these cases are clear.	Ngwa nke iwu nke ikpe ndị a doro anya.
He takes a lot of his clothes.	O were ọtụtụ uwe ya.
But he knew his limits.	Ma ọ maara ókè ya.
But here he is.	Ma ebe a ka ọ nọ.
But those cases are old-fashioned.	Ma ikpe ndị ahụ mere ochie.
They have one now.	Ha nwere otu onye ugbu a.
I am happy for you.	Enwere m obi ụtọ maka gị.
Have a happy time.	Nwee oge obi ụtọ.
Everything you can think of.	Ihe niile ị nwere ike iche.
Speed ​​is the most important thing.	Ọsọ bụ nke kacha mkpa.

It really is what happens.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ihe na-eme.

But the reality is far worse.	Ma nke bụ́ eziokwu dị nnọọ njọ karịa nke ahụ.
They live in the countryside.	Ha bi n’ime ime obodo.
When they heard it, they left him.	Mgbe ha nụrụ ha, ha hapụrụ ya.
We can live a long life.	Anyị nwere ike ịdị ogologo ndụ.
There can be no other reason for it.	Enweghị ike inwe ihe ọzọ kpatara ya.
Stop judging.	Kwụsị ikpe.

People should think differently.	Ndị mmadụ kwesịrị iche echiche dị iche.
But that is not for you to say.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị maka gị ikwu.
I was afraid the moon would not be visible tonight.	M na-atụ egwu na ọnwa agaghị ahụ anya n'abalị a.
Who can give me.	Onye nwere ike inye m.
However, it is not that simple.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mfe otú ahụ.
He wanted to paint, he thought.	Ọ chọrọ agba, o chere.
Think about what people are saying.	Na-eche banyere ihe ndị mmadụ na-ekwu.
There are so many unique things to do.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe pụrụ iche na-eme.
Their view seems plausible.	Echiche ha yiri ka ọ dị mma.
No matter what time it is, no matter what you do.	N'agbanyeghị oge ọ bụla, n'agbanyeghị ihe ị na-eme.
Of course, you do not want to see it.	N'ezie, ị gaghị achọ ịhụ ya.
You are very scared.	Ị tụrụ egwu nke ukwuu.
The game is powerful, and unparalleled in strength.	Egwuregwu dị ike, na nke siri ike na-enweghị atụ.
All of this is very beautiful.	Ihe a niile mara ezigbo mma.
Of course, they are not good parents.	N'ezie, ha abụghị ezigbo nne na nna.
You left your shoes here.	Ị hapụrụ akpụkpọ ụkwụ gị ebe a.
It's not just emotions.	Ọ bụghị naanị mmetụta uche.
But my brother without it was not easy.	Ma nwanne m nwoke enweghị ya dị mfe.

Just your job.	Naanị ọrụ gị.
Many people think he loves her.	Ọtụtụ ndị chere na ọ hụrụ ya n’anya.
Would love to see us.	Ga-achọ ịhụ anyị.
About two years, one week.	Ihe dị ka afọ abụọ, otu izu.

He is close.	Ọ nọ nso.
Of course, my car is good.	N'ezie, ụgbọ ala m dị mma.
We can go to two schools.	Anyị nwere ike ịga ụlọ akwụkwọ abụọ.
For a moment, old friends could not believe it.	Maka otu oge, ndị enyi ochie enweghị ike ikweta.
When successful they do it.	Mgbe ihe ịga nke ọma ha na-eme ya.
There is never a question if.	Ọ dịghị mgbe a ajụjụ ma ọ bụrụ.
However, this is difficult.	Otú ọ dị, nke a siri ike.

The car had a good feel to me.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ nwere mmetụta dị mma n'aka m.
Other things are impossible.	Ihe ndị ọzọ agaghị ekwe omume.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.
That is another life.	Nke ahụ bụ ndụ ọzọ.
You really are.	Ị bụ n'ezie.
It will be easy.	Ga-adị mfe.
In their head, their actions are valuable.	N'isi ha, ihe ha na-eme bara uru.
Just a negative feeling.	Naanị mmetụta ọjọọ.
Then the man's condition worsened.	Mgbe ahụ, ọnọdụ ikpeazụ nke nwoke ahụ dị njọ karịa nke mbụ.
Lots of useless money.	Ọtụtụ ego na-enweghị uru.
It belonged to their father.	Ọ bụ nke nna ha.

I have enough energy.	Enwere m ike zuru oke.
There is a great deal of authority.	Enwere oke ikike ikike.

Everything itself.	Ihe niile n'onwe ya.
If only he had known what it was.	A sị nnọọ na ọ maara nke ọ bụ.
This is important for two reasons.	Nke a dị mkpa n'ihi ihe abụọ.
The plane is high.	Ụgbọ elu dị elu.
Often, we are wise.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, anyị bụ ndị maara ihe.
He looked around.	O lere anya gburugburu.
Good customer.	Ezigbo onye ahịa.
This room has a bar.	Ụlọ a nwere ụlọ mmanya.
He wanted to be alone with them both.	Ọ chọrọ ka ọ bụrụ naanị ha abụọ.
It is an important event in history.	Ọ bụ ihe omume dị mkpa akụkọ ihe mere eme.
Something like music.	Ihe dị ka egwu.
His ears, of course, were pierced.	Ntị ya, n'ezie, a tụrụ atụ.
It's clear.	O doro anya.
But get out of the car.	Ma pụọ ​​ịnya ụgbọ ala.
This is my opinion.	Nke a bụ echiche m.
The fish is very good.	Azụ dị mma nke ukwuu.
The idea is clear.	Echiche ahụ doro anya.
Most of the same vegetables.	Ọtụtụ n'ime otu akwụkwọ nri ahụ.
And be different for kids !.	Ma bụrụ ihe dị iche maka ụmụaka!.
Of course it is.	O doro anya na ọ bụ.
It was cold when we started.	Ọ bụ oyi mgbe anyị malitere.
He is not hungry.	Agụụ adịghị ya.
Not many though.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ n'agbanyeghị.
But it still happens to me.	Ma, ọ ka na-eme m.
We did well today.	Anyị mere nke ọma taa.

Their circumstances are profoundly affected.	Ọnọdụ ha na-enwe mmetụta mmetụta dị ukwuu.

He took his time ahead of him.	O were oge ya n'ihu.
But unfortunately you have to do it yourself.	Ma ọ dị nwute na ị ga-eme ya n'onwe gị.
I do not know any of their real names.	Amaghị m nke ọ bụla n'ime ezigbo aha ha.
For us, this is the law.	Maka anyị, nke a bụ iwu.
He knew nothing about it.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ bụla banyere ya.
We need a few things.	Anyị chọrọ ihe ole na ole.
I am a new teacher.	Abụ m onye nkuzi ọhụrụ.
Why not go ahead with that.	Gịnị mere na ị gaghị aga n'ihu na .
There are a few of those.	Ọ dị ole na ole n'ime ndị ahụ.
It is unknown at this time.	Ọ bụ nke amaghị afọ.
We do not use any means.	Anyị anaghị eji ụzọ ọ bụla.
Being too big.	Ịbụ oke oke.
His work is special.	Ọrụ ya pụrụ iche.
It is a lie.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ụgha.
It seemed like he wanted to eat me alive.	Ọ dị ka ọ chọrọ iri m ndụ.
There are actually three.	Enwere n'ezie atọ.
I can't think there is no better way to end the day.	Enweghị m ike iche na ọ nweghị ụzọ ka mma isi kwụsị ụbọchị ahụ.
He looked at others.	O lere ndị ọzọ anya.
He has a fever.	Okpomọkụ gbara ya n'afọ.
Markets abound.	Ahịa juru ebe niile.
I think you feel that way.	Echere m na ọ dị gị otú ahụ.
I have known him for many years.	M maara ya kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
But its price is high.	Ma ọnụ ahịa ya dị elu.
He is confident as he speaks.	Obi siri ya ike ka ọ na-ekwu.
However, it is impossible to get the point.	Otú ọ dị, ọ gaghị ekwe omume iji nweta isi ihe.
But not so here.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ahụ ebe a.
He was angry.	Iwe were ya.
I know this is not good.	Ama m na nke a adịghị mma.
Maybe we are.	Ma eleghị anya, anyị bụ.
Not at this time.	Ọ bụghị n'oge a.
You looked at me.	I lere m anya.
Not that he thought it would happen.	Ọ bụghị na o chere na ọ ga-eme.
I want other people to do it.	Achọrọ m ihe ndị ọzọ ga-eme ya.
Need big money.	Mkpa nnukwu ego.
The restaurant is next to their office.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ dị n'akụkụ ụlọ ọrụ ha.
The little of the man's life was in them.	Ihe nta nke ndụ nwoke ahụ dị n'ime ha.

This case is actually the same as the previous one.	Ikpe a bụ n'ezie otu ihe nke gara aga.

Which way did it go?	Kedu ụzọ o si gaa?
Color it.	Agba agba ya.
It needs to come soon.	O kwesịrị ka ọ bịa ngwa ngwa.
And for whatever reason.	Na ihe ọ bụla kpatara ime ya.
He knows that.	Ọ maara nke ahụ.
You are a judge.	Ị bụrụ onye ikpe.
The food will be cooked well.	A ga-esi nri nke ọma.
He is sitting somewhere else.	Ọ nọ ọdụ ebe ọzọ.
The destination of this flight is unknown.	Amaghị ebe ụgbọ elu a na-aga.
Now, you have to be able to do it, like me.	Ugbu a, ị ga-enwe ike ime ya, dị ka m.
Most children are eaters.	Ọtụtụ ụmụaka bụ ndị na-eri ihe.
His mother died, and his father abandoned him.	Nne ya nwụrụ, nna ya hapụrụ ya.
That is too high.	Nke ahụ dị oke elu.
They left immediately.	Ha si na ya pụọ ​​ngwa ngwa.
And everyone else is close, too.	Na onye ọ bụla ọzọ nọ nso, kwa.
I was there when he died.	Anọ m ebe ahụ mgbe ọ nwụrụ.
We know who the mother is.	Anyị maara onye nne bụ.
And there is more to it.	Na e nwere ihe ọzọ na ya.
If this is your interest, you will not find anything here.	Ọ bụrụ na nke a bụ mmasị gị, ị gaghị ahụ ihe ọ bụla ebe a.
Two hours can be like minutes.	Awa abụọ nwere ike ịdị ka nkeji.
Obviously, do whatever you can.	N'ụzọ doro anya, mee ihe ọ bụla i nwere ike ime.
He heard it.	Ọ nụrụ ya.
It costs you.	Ọ na-eri gị.
He had no other family.	O nweghị ezinụlọ ọzọ.
But we do not have them.	Ma anyị enweghị ha.
This type of weather makes it always easy.	Ụdị ihu igwe a na-eme ka ọ dị mfe mgbe niile.
But not his eyes.	Ma ọ bụghị anya ya.
The plaintiff did not know the story.	Onye gbara akwụkwọ amaghị akụkọ ahụ.
Many other conspirators did the same.	Otú ahụ ka ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ gbara izu mere.
I feel like he is there.	Ọ dị m ka ọ̀ nọ ebe ahụ.
These are families.	Ndị a bụ ndị ezinụlọ.

They will not tell me.	Ha agaghị agwa m.
Nothing seems to be important right now.	Ọ dịghị ihe yiri ka ọ dị mkpa ugbu a.
It does not look like a long time ago.	Ọ naghị adị ka ogologo oge gara aga.
Everything seems to be in place.	Ihe niile yiri ka ọ nọ ebe.
I feel worse than that.	Ọ dị m njọ karịa nke ahụ.
Everyone has their own thing to work for.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ihe nke ya na-arụ ọrụ maka ya.
That’s his problem, that’s not my problem.	Nke ahụ bụ nsogbu ya, nke ahụ abụghị nsogbu m.
Not so today.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ taa.
Funding for schools.	Ego maka ụlọ akwụkwọ.
It is not easy to relax.	Ọ dịghị mfe izu ike.
And not only that.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị nke ahụ.
She is really scared.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya n'ezie.
Or why we can still make things happen.	Ma ọ bụ ya mere anyị ka nwere ike ime ka ihe mee.
He left her.	Ọ hapụrụ ya.
She will look for him when he arrives.	Ọ ga-achọ ya mgbe ọ rutere.
His team did not do well.	Ndị otu ya emeghị nke ọma.
I know it's true.	Amaara m na ọ bụ eziokwu.
And that’s when we went on good news, of course.	Ma nke ahụ bụ mgbe anyị gara na ezi ozi, n'ezie.
It seems a little simple.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị ntakịrị mfe.
Fear all the time.	Na-atụ ụjọ oge niile.
It's really kind of around the family.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ụdị gburugburu ezinụlọ.
He did the same thing over and over again.	O mere otu ihe ahụ ugboro ugboro.
Before that, they were delicious.	Tupu mgbe ahụ, ha na-atọ ụtọ.
There would have been no chance for me.	Agaraghị enwe ohere maka m.
Another layer of just that.	Ọzọ oyi akwa nke dị nnọọ.
The truth of this idea is beyond doubt.	Eziokwu nke echiche a enweghị obi abụọ.
Some days like that.	Ụbọchị ụfọdụ dị otú ahụ.
We hope the suggestion can help you !.	Anyị nwere olileanya na aro ahụ nwere ike inyere gị aka!.
But whatever the reason, we are.	Ma n'agbanyeghị ihe kpatara ya, anyị nọ.
They are nothing.	Ha abụghị ihe.
Without water, life is impossible.	Enweghị mmiri, ndụ agaghị ekwe omume.
Words may not be used.	Enwere ike ghara iji okwu.
But he did it.	Ma o mere ya.
He was amazed.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.
Just a great variety of things.	Naanị nnukwu ụdị ihe niile.
But it is not good.	Ma ọ dịghị mma.
I really thought about it.	M chere banyere ya n'ezie.
He likes sports.	Egwuregwu na-amasị ya.
I'm glad I was here.	Obi dị m ụtọ na m nọ ebe a.
You can't go there.	Ị gaghị aga ebe ahụ.
They know we are stronger.	Ha ma na anyị ka ike.
Given playing each game in the second color.	Nyere na-egwu egwuregwu ọ bụla na agba nke abụọ.
Good job.	Ezigbo ọrụ.
This will be the fourth.	Nke a ga-abụ nke anọ.
I want him to love me every day.	Achọrọ m ka ọ hụ m n'anya kwa ụbọchị.
It struck him in the heart.	Ọ gbara ya n’obi.
This, of course, is true.	Nke a, n'ezie, bụ eziokwu.
Which they want.	Nke ha chọrọ.
He has good words.	O nwere okwu dị mma.
I think she was very nervous.	Echere m na ụjọ tụrụ ya nke ukwuu.
The labor market continued on time.	Ahịa ọrụ gara n'ihu n'oge.
That was done immediately.	E mere nke ahụ ozugbo.
There are many more!	Enwere ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ!
Take this example.	Were ihe atụ a.
He cannot see.	Ọ naghị ahụ ụzọ.
Certainly not.	O doro anya na ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
But we all know.	Ma anyị niile maara.
The item is as simple as absolutely beautiful.	Ihe ahụ dị mfe dị ka ihe zuru oke mara mma.
I want to see you.	Achọrọ m ịhụ gị.
There is a little more.	Enwere obere ihe ọzọ.
Now, the point is this.	Ugbu a, isi ihe bụ nke a.
But they can be very different.	Ma ha nwere ike ịdị nnọọ iche.
But history has not.	Ma akụkọ ihe mere eme emeghị otú ahụ.
My sister-in-law is pregnant.	Nwanne di m di ime.
That says a lot.	Nke ahụ na-ekwu ọtụtụ ihe.
I'm not.	Ọ masịrị m na ọ bụghị.
But he said nothing.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ na-ekwu.
We really like them.	Anyị nwere mmasị na ha n'ezie.
He left.	Ọ hapụrụ.
It is even worse.	Ọ ka njọ karịa.
The newspaper is a fantastic story.	Akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ bụ akụkọ dị egwu.
He has a body.	O nwere ahụ.
He is ready to go at this time.	Ọ dị njikere ịga n'oge a.
Some action plans.	Ụfọdụ atụmatụ ime ihe.
It is very difficult!	O siri ike nke ukwuu!
No question, of course.	Enweghị ajụjụ, n'ezie.
Sometimes that works, sometimes not so much.	Mgbe ụfọdụ nke ahụ na-arụ ọrụ, mgbe ụfọdụ ọ bụghị nke ukwuu.
This is a major problem.	Nke a bụ isi nsogbu.
This is a lie.	Nke a bụ ụgha.
But we are only friends.	Ma anyị bụ naanị enyi.
Some games require two games.	Egwuregwu ụfọdụ chọrọ egwuregwu abụọ.
Maybe beautiful, beautiful.	Ma eleghị anya, mara mma, mara mma.

There is a crowd.	Enwere igwe mmadụ.

We are all in the same boat.	Anyị niile nọ n'otu ụgbọ mmiri.
Or by itself.	Ma ọ bụ site n'onwe ya.
Grandpa is here.	Nna nna nọ ebe a.

Not if you care about your work.	Ọ bụghị ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-eche banyere ọrụ gị.
He is not happy to ride it.	Obi adịghị ya ụtọ ịnya ya.
It does not happen.	Ọ naghị eme.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
Not in this big building, which has a fantastic view.	Ọ bụghị na nnukwu ụlọ a, nke nwere echiche dị egwu.
He loves to want me to do anything with him.	Ọ hụrụ n'anya na ọ chọrọ ka mụ na ya mee ihe ọ bụla.
Many workers work indoors.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ n'ime ụlọ.
That is not our judgment.	Nke ahụ abụghị ikpe anyị.
Men are very simple.	Ụmụ nwoke dị nnọọ mfe.
I didn’t know it was this week until last night.	Amaghị m na ọ bụ n'izu a ruo n'abalị ikpeazụ.

Everything was fine a few hours ago.	Ihe niile dị mma awa ole na ole gara aga.
But the house is not good.	Mana ụlọ ahụ adịghị mma.
No, you have to go.	Mba, ị ga-aga.
There is no physical difference.	Enweghị ahụ iche.
That is why we are unique.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị pụrụ iche.
If you have any ideas.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere echiche ọ bụla.
But now it is ready to use.	Ma ugbu a ọ dị njikere iji.

I need to think about others here, not just myself.	Ekwesịrị m iche echiche banyere ndị ọzọ ebe a, ọ bụghị naanị onwe m.

About this time.	N'ihe dị ka oge a.
One bad time.	Otu oge ọjọọ.

The place is hard on the water.	Ebe ahụ siri ike na mmiri.
But that would be no different.	Ma nke ahụ agaghị abụ ihe dị iche.
This idea is not yours.	Echiche a abụghị nke gị.
But like drugs, some will go further.	Ma dị ka ọgwụ ọjọọ, ụfọdụ ga-aga n'ihu.

Nice to see it.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ ya.
They may need it for its effects.	Ha nwere ike ịchọrọ ya maka mmetụta ya.
What time is it, he asked.	Kedu oge ọ bụ, ọ jụrụ.
He is not allowed to go there.	A naghị ekwe ka ọ gaa ebe ahụ.
Sometimes they are really scary.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha na-atụ egwu n'ezie.
But the success of our path is clear.	Ma ihe ịga nke ọma nke ụzọ anyị doro anya.
That is the law of the land.	Nke ahụ bụ iwu iwu obodo.
It is more than that.	Ọ karịrị nke ahụ.
And as solid as it is.	Na dị ka siri ike ahụ dị ka o nwere.

Your strength is everything.	Ike gị bụ ihe niile.
It helped to make it a success.	O nyere aka mee ka ọ nwee ihe ịga nke ọma.

None of those people knew who he was.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ndị ahụ maara onye onye ahụ bụ.
But it will not be easy.	Ma ọ gaghị adị mfe.
It's worse.	Ọ ka njọ.
Then there is the plane.	Mgbe ahụ enwere ụgbọ elu.

I liked it, but my parents didn't see it.	Ọ masịrị m, ma ndị mụrụ m ahụghị ya.
We are stronger than this.	Anyị siri ike karịa nke a.
They know it's better there.	Ha maara na ọ ka mma n'ebe ahụ.
By example.	Site n'ihe atụ.
He ate his meal.	O riri nri ya.
I think we can do that.	Echere m na anyị nwere ike ime nke ahụ.
He said no one was home.	O kwuru na o nweghị onye nọ n'ụlọ.
But they will only have girls.	Ma ha ga-enwe naanị ụmụ agbọghọ.
You can't do both.	Ị nweghị ike ime ha abụọ.
This is an old problem.	Nke a bụ nsogbu ochie.
For a day it did.	Ruo otu ụbọchị o mere.
What is he looking for?	Gịnị ka ọ na-achọ?

Those are two different jobs.	Ndị ahụ bụ ọrụ abụọ dị iche iche.

And you have it.	Na ị nwere ya.
There are two main points.	Enwere isi ihe abụọ.
The problem itself.	Nsogbu n'onwe ya.
I was just a man.	Abụ m naanị nwoke.
No one can know what the baby is doing.	Ọ dịghị onye pụrụ ịma ihe nwa ọhụrụ ahụ na-eme.
I say no, you don't.	Ana m asị mba, ị naghị.
All of this is internal matter, of course.	Ihe a niile bụ ala dị n'ime, n'ezie.
He hurried to help.	O mere ngwa ngwa gaa nyere aka.
People are crowded here.	Ndị mmadụ juru ebe a.
Maybe we like to talk about it.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ na-amasị anyị ikwu banyere ya.
I feel like I have no shirt on.	Ọ dị m ka onwe m enweghị uwe elu.

The baby will need rest.	Nwa ahụ ga-achọ izu ike.
He just wanted her to be happy.	Naanị ihe ọ chọrọ bụ ka ọ na-atọ ya ụtọ.
I feel beautiful right away.	Ọ dị m ka ọ mara mma ozugbo.
She did not know who the man was.	Ọ maghị onye nwoke ahụ bụ.
However, sometimes.	Otú ọ dị mgbe ụfọdụ.
It is important to know oneself.	Ọ dị mkpa ka a mara onwe ya.
It should be a lot of fun.	Ọ kwesịrị ịbụ ọtụtụ ihe ọchị.
He died a few years ago.	Ọ nwụrụ afọ ole na ole gara aga.
We would not want that.	Anyị agaghị achọ nke ahụ.
He has a problem, in some ways.	O nwere nsogbu, n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
So now we are trying our best.	Ya mere ugbu a, anyị na-agbalị ike anyị.
Tears welled up in her eyes.	Anya mmiri gbara ya n'anya.
And about his own fears.	Na banyere ụjọ nke ya.
Acting does nothing.	Ime ihe anaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.
It doesn't have to be this awesome.	O kwesịghị ịbụ nke a dị egwu.
Newspapers are special books.	Akwụkwọ akụkọ bụ akwụkwọ pụrụ iche.
I have only done two so far.	M mere naanị abụọ ruo ugbu a.
People will be affected.	Ndị mmadụ ga-enwe mmetụta.
So nothing more here.	Ya mere, ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ebe a.
You need to know that.	I kwesịrị ịma nke ahụ.
They seem very small.	Ha yiri nnọọ obere.
Everyone has a story.	Onye ọ bụla nwere akụkọ.
There is one small word.	Enwere otu obere okwu.
He should try the test several times.	Ọ kwesịrị ịgba ule ahụ ọtụtụ oge.
It’s not the kind of fun comedy.	Ọ bụghị ụdị ọchị na-atọ ụtọ.
Only when the idea is finished is it true.	Naanị mgbe echiche kwụsịrị bụ eziokwu.
Maybe it doesn't make you.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ naghị eme ka gị.
We have a party!	Anyị na-eme oriri!
What happened next surprised me.	Ihe ọzọ merenụ tụrụ m n’anya.
But please let me know.	Ma biko mee ka m mara.
They said we could talk to him in the morning.	Ha kwuru na anyị nwere ike ịgwa ya okwu n'ụtụtụ.
This practice is not new to the music industry.	Omume a abụghị ihe ọhụrụ na ụlọ ọrụ egwu.
His hand.	Aka ya.
We need people like him.	Anyị chọrọ ndị dị ka ya.
These are the book seekers who have it all.	Ndị a bụ ndị na-achọ akwụkwọ nwere ya niile.
Now that is a scary idea.	Ugbu a nke ahụ bụ echiche na-atụ egwu.
They are tough.	Ha siri ike.
Lots of people.	Ọtụtụ mmadụ.
No one has, as he knows.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere, dị ka ọ maara.
I feel good.	Ahụ dị m mma.
Money is not the most important thing, but success is.	Ego abụghị ihe kacha mkpa, mana ihe ịga nke ọma bụ.
The second point is this.	Isi okwu nke abụọ bụ otu a.
This is a time of hope.	Nke a bụ oge olileanya.
However, this is not the case.	Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị ikpe.
A lot of people work at home these days.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-arụ ọrụ n'ụlọ ụbọchị ndị a.
She is the mother of two sons and one daughter.	Ọ bụ nne nke ụmụ nwoke abụọ na otu nwanyị.
I will give you rest.	M ga-eme ka ị zuru ike.
The body is happy and mental.	Ahụ na-enwe obi ụtọ na uche.
But his conduct was not a moral one.	Ma omume ya abụghị ọrụ omume.
It should be now.	O kwesịrị ka ọ dị ugbu a.
Others do not want to see this picture.	Ndị ọzọ achọghị ịhụ foto a.
This interview was conducted with two different people.	A gbara ajụjụ ọnụ a na otu mmadụ abụọ dị iche iche.
Then I have, of course.	Mgbe ahụ enwere m, n'ezie.
They did not see what they had done.	Ha ahụghị ihe ọjọọ ha mere.
It is closest to the fire.	Ọ kacha nso nso ọkụ.
Or whatever they are.	Ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla ha bụ.
Now there are about one or two.	Ugbu a ọ dị ihe dị ka otu ma ọ bụ abụọ.
Yours may be different.	Nke gị nwere ike ịdị iche.
They say it is beautiful.	Ha na-ekwu na ọ mara mma.
Going forward you wonder if you are doing something.	Ịga n'ihu ị na-eche ma ị na-eme ihe.
The first three are work gifts.	Atọ ndị mbụ bụ onyinye ọrụ.
Things are really good.	Ihe dị mma n'ezie.
There may be some good and bad ways of life.	Enwere ike inwe ụzọ ndụ ụfọdụ dị mma na nke ọjọọ.
He is known for his speed.	A maara ya maka ọsọ ya.
He felt ready for anything.	O chere na ọ dị njikere maka ihe ọ bụla.
I need to feed him.	M kwesịrị inye ya nri.
But never this.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe nke a.
She has a passion for travel.	O nwere uche maka njem.
I talk about people.	M na-ekwu maka ndị mmadụ.
But let's face it.	Ma ka anyị nweta eziokwu.
Food for one.	Nri maka otu.
This can go a long way.	Nke a nwere ike ịga ọtụtụ ụzọ.
This is different from the others he saw.	Nke a dị iche na ndị ọzọ ọ hụrụ.
It is better not to cry.	Ọ ka mma ị ghara ibe akwa.
The cost of the accident is huge.	Ọnụ ego nke ihe mberede ahụ dị ukwuu.
Happy next year.	Nwee obi ụtọ na afọ ndị ọzọ.
Language problems can.	Nsogbu asụsụ nwere ike.
Again, this is not new information.	Ọzọ, nke a abụghị ozi ọhụrụ.
Some cities are famous for having many hospitals.	Obodo ụfọdụ a ma ama maka inwe ọtụtụ ụlọ ọgwụ.
But there are many.	Ma ọ dị ọtụtụ.
The house is not far.	Ụlọ adịghị anya.
The project was successful.	Ọrụ ahụ gara nke ọma.
He asked two basic questions.	Ọ jụrụ ajụjụ abụọ bụ́ isi.
I would be fine now.	Ọ ga-adị m mma ugbu a.
There are still people swimming on the beach.	A ka nwere ndị mmadụ na-egwu mmiri n'akụkụ osimiri.
He loves his people.	Ọ hụrụ ndị ya n’anya.
Everyone knows them.	Onye ọ bụla n'ime ha ma gị.
It can be made for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.	Enwere ike ime ya maka nri ụtụtụ, nri ehihie, ma ọ bụ nri abalị.
Nothing less.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ dịghị obere.
Steal the items.	Zuru ihe ndị ahụ.
You are only telling the truth.	Ị na-ekwu naanị eziokwu.
Our lives together.	Ndụ anyị ọnụ.
I am his mother.	Abụ m nne ya.
Not three minutes, but three days.	Ọ bụghị nkeji atọ, mana ụbọchị atọ.
So, let’s get to know it better.	Ya mere, ka anyị mara nke ọma.
That's the way it really is to me.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị m n'ezie.
He has no books.	O nweghị akwụkwọ.
What a beautiful place for a hard place.	Kedu ebe mara mma maka ebe siri ike.
I'll stay there.	Aga m anọ ebe ahụ.
He could not think clearly.	O nweghị ike iche echiche nke ọma.
He was right about that.	O kwuru eziokwu banyere nke ahụ.
Think of it as a story about you and the food.	Were ya dị ka akụkọ banyere gị na nri.
It is more than that.	Ọ karịrị ya.
It happened in the afternoon.	O mere n'ime ehihie.
He spent many days with his friends.	Ya na ndị enyi ya nọrọ ọtụtụ ụbọchị.
Thank you for being awesome !.	Daalụ ị dị egwu!.
Thanks for driving.	Daalụ maka ịnya ụgbọ ahụ.
He is far away from home.	Ọ nọ n'ebe dị anya n'ụlọ.
It was a pointless journey.	Ọ bụ njem na-enweghị isi.
Men are examples.	Ụmụ nwoke bụ ihe atụ.
There is something to be successful.	Ọ nwere ihe ga-aga nke ọma.
He suggested his place.	Ọ tụrụ aro ebe ya.
There is more work and better quality.	Enwere nnukwu ọrụ na ịdị mma karịa.
It's me for it.	Ọ bụ m maka ya.
Its fire and speed.	Ọkụ ya na ọsọ ya.
It's bad.	Ọ dara njọ.
He did it, you know.	O mere ya, ị mara.
A few hours of it was impossible.	Awa ole na ole n'ime ya enweghị ike.
This is my life, this is it.	Nke a bụ ndụ m, nke a bụ ya.
Everything else happened.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ mere.
They did their best in the hospital.	Ha mere ike ha niile n’ụlọ ọgwụ.
The dress is fresh.	Uwe ahụ dị ọhụrụ.
Not just books,	Ọ bụghị naanị akwụkwọ,
However, this is not the case.	Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị ikpe.
That is likely to be the cause of the problem.	Nke ahụ yikarịrị ka ọ bụ ihe kpatara nsogbu ahụ.
He did that for ten years or so.	O mere nke ahụ ihe dị ka afọ iri ma ọ bụ karịa.
But you do not want to do this.	Ma ị gaghị achọ ime nke a.
What we have, is temporary.	Ihe a anyị nwere, ọ bụ nwa oge.
This could be their home, their own and their own.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ ụlọ nke ha, nke ya na nke ya.
Is there anything like this ?.	Ọ nwere ihe dị ka nke a kwuru?.
It will be here.	Ọ ga-adị ebe a.
I saw one another and the other.	Ahụrụ m onye ọzọ na nke ọzọ.
It is hard to give her daughter such a skeptical advantage.	O siri ike inye nwa ya nwanyị uru dị otú ahụ nke obi abụọ.
Only what he will do will please him.	Naanị ihe ọ ga-eme ga-adị ya mma.
But they are, in fact, two very different things.	Ma n'ezie, ha bụ ihe abụọ dị nnọọ iche.
It is his watch.	Ọ bụ elekere ya.
There are no doors.	Enweghị ọnụ ụzọ.
So do those like us.	Otú ahụ ka ndị dị ka anyị si eme.
He took another bold step.	O ji obi siri ike mee ihe ọzọ.
The point is not what but how.	Isi ihe abụghị ihe ma olee otú.
This is what we all have.	Nke a bụ ihe anyị niile nwere.
An exciting new project began last year.	Ọrụ ọhụrụ dị oke egwu malitere n'afọ gara aga.
They are invisible.	A naghị ahụ ha anya.
A teacher asked me a question.	Otu onye nkuzi jụrụ m ajụjụ.
He was right about that.	O kwuru eziokwu banyere nke ahụ.
He called the hospital.	Ọ kpọrọ ụlọ ọgwụ.
No one is happy.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere obi ụtọ.
Fresh meat taste.	Mmasị anụ arụ ọhụrụ.
We miss him.	Agụụ ya na-agụ anyị.
But that is not the case here.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka ọ dị ebe a.
I loved the movie so much.	Ahụrụ m ihe nkiri ahụ n'anya nke ukwuu.
It could be his, it could be yours.	O nwere ike ịbụ nke ya, ọ nwere ike ịbụ nke gị.
This fish is fresh fish.	Azụ a bụ azụ azụ ọhụrụ.
It is the least we can do.	Ọ bụ ihe kacha nta anyị nwere ike ime.
It looks like a real order.	Ọ dị ka iwu n'ezie.
But they are.	Ma ha dị.
No one has.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere.
Now it is up to you to help me.	Ugbu a ọ bụ gị ga-enyere m aka.
It was a long time ago.	Ọ bụ ogologo oge gara aga.
This is an hour for sleep.	Nke a bụ awa maka ụra.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
They are the same truth.	Ha bụ otu eziokwu.
I think he was talking about me, but he was not.	Echere m na ọ na-ekwu banyere m, ma ọ bụghị ya.
He loves a job like this.	Ọ hụrụ ọrụ dị ka nke a n'anya.
We must be ready for it.	Anyị ga-adị njikere maka ya.
We cannot be reasonable.	Anyị enweghị ike inwe ezi uche.
See the documentation if you want to see the project.	Hụ akwụkwọ ahụ ma ịchọrọ ịhụ ọrụ ahụ.
They have a small budget.	Ha nwere obere ego.
That's my style.	Nke ahụ bụ ụdị m.
This does not taste very good.	Nke a anaghị atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
There is no other way around this.	Ọ dịghị ụzọ ọzọ gburugburu nke a.
Not so much of it.	Ọ bụghị nke ukwuu nke ya.
Everything you have told us is false.	Ihe niile ị gwara anyị bụ ụgha.
Everyone is welcome to attend.	A chọrọ onye ọ bụla ka ọ bịa ọmụmụ ihe.
It is not the same as before.	Ọ bụghị azụ ka ọ dị na mbụ.
Get the money.	Nweta ego ahụ.
I may be invisible.	Enwere m ike ịbụ ihe anaghị ahụ anya.
You know now.	Ị maara ugbu a.
But the fact is that this is your job.	Mana nke bụ eziokwu bụ na nke a bụ ọrụ ị nwere.
That may be the one you like best.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ nke kacha mara gị mma.
He needs drinks or medicine.	Ọ chọrọ ihe ọṅụṅụ ma ọ bụ ọgwụ.
And everything seems very new.	Na ihe niile yiri nnọọ ọhụrụ.
I don't want to do bad things.	Achọghị m ime ihe ọjọọ.
He immediately went into the room.	Ọ gara ozugbo n'ime ụlọ ahụ.
Stop thinking about this.	Kwụsị iche echiche banyere nke a.
I hope people like it.	Enwere m olileanya na ndị mmadụ masịrị ya.
They are big bags, each, similar.	Ha bụ nnukwu akpa, nke ọ bụla, yiri.
And every happiness we can find.	Na obi ụtọ ọ bụla anyị nwere ike ịchọta.
I'm sure it will go well.	Eji m n'aka na ọ ga-eme nke ọma.
The hall was packed.	Ndị mmadụ juru n’ụlọ nzukọ ahụ.
She goes to school every day.	Ọ na-aga akwụkwọ kwa ụbọchị.
Everything will be fine.	Ihe niile ga-adị mma.
I admired the city and its beauty.	Obodo ahụ masịrị m na ịma mma ya.
Just a moment.	Naanị nwa oge.
No one believed him.	Ọ dịghị onye kwere ya.
Where is the girl.	Ebe nwa agbọghọ ahụ nọ.
We do not have those.	Anyị enweghị ndị ahụ.
Obviously not.	O doro anya na ọ naghị eme nke ọma.
Lots of problems.	Ọtụtụ nsogbu.
But that's all there is to it.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe niile dị.
She is happy that she can help.	Obi dị ya ụtọ na ya nwere ike inye aka.
It never comes on time.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-abịa n'oge.
As soon as they are.	Ozugbo ha bụ.
The app is for him not me.	Ngwa ahụ bụ maka ya ọ bụghị m.
That’s the front office.	Nke ahụ bụ ụlọ ọrụ ihu.
What beautiful friends, and beautiful boat.	Kedu ndị enyi mara mma, na ụgbọ mmiri mara mma.
We need each other but are afraid to move on.	Anyị chọrọ ibe anyị mana ụjọ na-atụ anyị ịga n'ihu.
Only two people are easy.	Naanị mmadụ abụọ dị mfe.
Some might play the game, but not me.	Ụfọdụ nwere ike ịkpọ egwuregwu ahụ, ma ọ bụghị m.
Just everywhere.	Naanị ebe niile.
Her husband should not be left alone.	Di ya ekwesịghị ịnọ naanị ya.
I really liked how it happened.	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu ka ọ siri mee.
There are many reasons for doing so.	Ime otú ahụ nwere mmasị n'ihi ọtụtụ ihe.
There is no heat.	Okpomọkụ adịghị.
He rejected the idea.	Ọ jụrụ echiche ahụ.
Maybe it's because if you can then you will, and you do.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ n'ihi na ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike mgbe ahụ ị ga-eme, na ị na-eme.
For decades, this practice continued.	Ruo ọtụtụ iri afọ, omume a gara n'ihu.
The plan will not work at all.	Atụmatụ agaghị arụ ọrụ ma ọlị.
I can't believe this is what people think of me.	Apụghị m ikweta na nke a bụ ihe ndị mmadụ chere banyere m.
But some of it still works.	Ma ụfọdụ n'ime ya ka na-arụ ọrụ.
There will be access to those rights.	A ga-enwe ohere ị nweta ikike ndị ahụ.
There is no power there.	Ike adịghị ebe ahụ.
The journey was awesome.	Njem ahụ dị egwu.
Tell me whatever it says.	Gwa m okwu ọ bụla ọ gwara gị.
It's a good idea.	Ọ bụ ezi echiche.
In fact, it may happen faster than we know it.	N'ezie, o nwere ike na-eme ngwa ngwa karịa ka anyị maara.
Everything should be done well.	Ekwesịrị ime ihe niile nke ọma.
However, the good news.	Otú ọ dị, ozi ọma.
They met and fell in love.	Ha zutere wee hụ n'anya.
I never felt that way.	Enweghị m mmetụta ahụ ma ọlị.
It’s just an important situation.	Ọ bụ naanị ọnọdụ dị mkpa.
There are many reasons why it is not.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara na ọ bụghị.
That's not very good.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma nke ukwuu.
I could have done.	m gaara eme.
I am not myself now.	Abụghị m onwe m ugbu a.
So sit down.	Ya mere nọdụ ala.
This is a market.	Nke a bụ ahịa.
It’s like being the only thing that matters.	Ọ dị ka ịbụ naanị ihe dị.
He knew now that he needed more.	Ọ maara ugbu a na ọ chọrọ ihe ọzọ.
We have good weapons.	Anyị nwere ngwa ọgụ nke ọma.
He was thinking, fast.	Ọ nọ na-eche, ngwa ngwa.
Your friends are small.	Enyi gị dị ntakịrị.
By and.	Site na site.
But there is hope.	Ma e nwere olileanya.
Everyone, every nation, every idea.	Onye ọ bụla, mba ọ bụla, echiche ọ bụla.
The eye itself can do nothing.	Anya n'onwe ya apụghị ime ihe ọ bụla.
There is no room for this.	O nweghị ohere na nke a.
Again, this is too much.	Ọzọ, nke a bụ oke oke.
As he did.	Dị ka o mere.
There are many ways.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụzọ.
However, we humans are still doing that.	Otú ọ dị, anyị bụ́ ụmụ mmadụ ka na-eme ya.
Every day is a fast time.	Ụbọchị niile bụ oge ọsọ ọsọ.
Our ancestors came from the monkey species.	Ndị nna nna anyị si na ụdị enwe.
Said it was too much.	Kwuru na ọ karịrị oke.
But do your best.	Mana mee ike gị naanị.
They will be our prisoners.	Ha ga-abụ ndị mkpọrọ anyị.
Nothing he does has any value.	Ọ dịghị ihe o mere nwere uru ọ bụla.
It works well now.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma ugbu a.
Take for example.	Were ihe atụ.
This is our house here.	Nke a bụ ụlọ anyị ebe a.
Keep me busy.	Na-eme m ọrụ n'aka.
Next time.	Oge ọzọ.
Why is it important for me to do this?	Gịnị mere o ji dị mkpa ka m mee nke a?
But I'm fine.	Mana ọ dị m mma.
I think you should think about this.	Echere m na i kwesịrị iche echiche nke a.
He is proud of his success.	Obi dị ya ụtọ maka ihe ịga nke ọma ya.
But that is a personal opinion.	Ma nke ahụ bụ echiche onwe onye.
That is not why we are here.	Ọ bụghị ya mere anyị ji nọrọ ebe a.
I can not do anything.	Enweghị m ike ime ihe ọ bụla.
They both wanted this, he understood.	Ha abụọ chọrọ nke a, ọ ghọtara.
But that is.	Ma nke ahụ bụ.
The news came as a surprise to many.	Akụkọ ahụ tụrụ ọtụtụ ndị anya.
You do not know the dog.	Ị maghị na nkịta.
Each employee has a name and age.	Onye ọrụ ọ bụla nwere aha na afọ.
It is true.	Ọ bụ eziokwu.
Her son has it.	Nwa ya na ya nwere.
If anyone can find it you can.	Ọ bụrụ na onye ọ bụla nwere ike ịchọta ya ị nwere ike.
They found it everywhere.	Ha nwetara ya ebe niile.
One egg, but there will be ten more.	Otu akwa, ma a ga-enwe ọzọ iri.
I need strength.	Ike dị m mkpa.
The court did not do so.	Ụlọ ikpe emeghị otú ahụ.
I was the first to call it quits.	Abụ m onye mbụ kpọrọ ya.
It is what makes it different, what makes it special.	Ọ bụ ihe mere ka ọ dị iche, ihe mere ya pụrụ iche.
He was rejected.	A jụrụ ya.
But he will not be the only policeman.	Mana ọ gaghị abụ naanị onye uwe ojii.
Or tomorrow.	Ma ọ bụ echi.
I do not know what that is.	Amaghị m ihe nke ahụ bụ.
That is his story.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ya.
His mother bought it.	Nne ya zụtara ya.
At first it was really good.	Na mbụ ọ dị ezigbo mma.
That's when it happened.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka ọ dị.
She is far away from home.	Ọ nọ n'ebe dị anya site n'ụlọ.
Life will go on.	Ndụ ga-aga n'ihu.
It was a game, my man.	Ọ bụ egwuregwu, nwoke m.
There is not enough information for the study right now.	Enweghị ozi zuru oke maka ọmụmụ ihe ugbu a.
I am in a bad mood.	Anọ m n'ụzọ ọjọọ.
I will miss you, he said.	Aga m atụ uche gị, o kwuru.
I do not have a suitcase.	Anaghị m akpa akwa.
But it's good.	Mana ọ dị mma.
I can know what your job is, and why.	Enwere m ike ịma ihe ọrụ gị bụ, na ihe kpatara ya.
Life does not work today.	Ndụ anaghị arụ ọrụ taa.
They are powerful.	Ha bụ ihe ndị dị ike.
I do not see you many days a day.	Anaghị m ahụ gị ọtụtụ ụbọchị kwa ụbọchị.
People need to know their abilities.	Ndị mmadụ kwesịrị ịma ikike ha.
This restaurant is known for providing good food.	A maara ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ a maka inye ezigbo nri.
It surprised him for a while.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya ruo oge ụfọdụ.
We have so much.	Anyị nwere nke ukwuu.
I just can't believe myself.	M nnọọ ike kwere onwe m.
Twenty years ago, he was a teenager.	Afọ iri abụọ gara aga, ọ bụ nwata.
Weak as water.	Adịghị ike dị ka mmiri.
Face to face.	Ihu ihu.
So much progress, so much to do.	Nke ukwuu na-aga n'ihu, nke ukwuu ime.
It tasted bad in his mouth.	Ahụrụ ya ụtọ ọjọọ n'ọnụ ya.
They are hard to do.	Ha siri ike ime.
Then some more.	Mgbe ahụ ụfọdụ ndị ọzọ.
He got one.	O nwetara otu.
The fact is that you can.	Nke bụ eziokwu bụ na ị nwere ike.
But then he fell in love.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ hụrụ n'anya.
At this time, no one can.	N'oge a, ọ dịghị onye nwere ike.
However, nothing seems to be doing that.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị ihe yiri ka ọ na-eme nke ahụ.
But he knew that.	Ma ọ maara nke ahụ.
So the doubts still exist.	Ya mere obi abụọ ahụ ka dị.
It looks very similar.	O yiri nnọọ ya.
He did it.	O mere ya.
The ground will be wet.	Ala ga-adị mmiri mmiri.
There is nothing wrong with this game.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị njọ na egwuregwu a.
The disease was named.	A kpọrọ aha ọrịa ahụ aha.
The doctor looked at the patient.	Dọkịta lere onye ọrịa ahụ.
I would do such a thing.	M ga-eme ihe dị otú ahụ.
No one said.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru.
Man not.	Nwoke na-adịghị.
School uniforms are not required here.	Achọghị uwe ụlọ akwụkwọ ebe a.
The group continued their journey.	Otu ahụ gara n'ihu na njem ha.
Let someone else do it.	Ka onye ọzọ gwa ya.
All this for his family.	Ihe a niile maka ezinụlọ ya.
But of course they did.	Ma n'ezie ha mere.
I need money from somewhere.	Achọrọ m ego si ebe.
Both cities are close by.	Obodo abụọ a dị nso.
Individual and group tutorials are available for your convenience.	Ndị mmadụ n'otu n'otu na nkuzi otu dị maka ịdị mma gị.
Sometimes this happened two or three times a night.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, nke a mere ugboro abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ n'otu abalị.
Another reason is price.	Ihe ọzọ kpatara ya bụ ọnụ ahịa.
He is wearing a long dress.	O yi uwe ogologo.
The building itself looks good.	Ụlọ ahụ n'onwe ya yiri ka ọ dị mma.
We looked.	Anyị lere anya.
I do not know how these children felt.	Amaghị m otú obi dị ụmụaka ndị a.
You did your best.	I mere ihe niile i nwere ike ime.
I burned them both.	M gbara ha abụọ ọkụ.
The temperature is too low.	Okpomọkụ dị obere.
In fact, it is still more beautiful than ever.	N'ezie, ọ ka mara mma karịa ka ọ dị na mbụ.
I am a fool.	M bụ onye nzuzu.
There is help out there, really !!.	Enwere enyemaka n'ebe ahụ, eziokwu!!.
Those are the words.	Ihe ndị ahụ bụ okwu ya.
On the face of it this is a simple matter.	Na ihu ihe nke a bụ okwu dị mfe.
Big and powerful.	Nnukwu na ike.
They are both beautiful.	Ha abụọ mara mma.
They were working on it.	Ha nọ na-arụ ọrụ na ya.
They met at the airport.	Ha zutere n'ọdụ ụgbọ elu.
It seems like a long time.	Ọ dị ka ogologo oge.
But in practice it is very different.	Ma na omume ọ dị nnọọ iche.
I don't know about him.	Amaghị m ihe ahụ banyere ya.
It’s the same story for everyone alive.	Ọ bụ otu akụkọ ahụ maka onye ọ bụla dị ndụ.
We stopped on the way.	Anyị kwụsịrị n'ụzọ.
Many people think so.	Ọtụtụ ndị chere otú ahụ.
Others say, but be aware of this.	Ndị ọzọ na-ekwu, mana mara nke a.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
That skin is.	Akpụkpọ ahụ ya bụ.
I was his only wife.	Abụ m naanị nwunye ya mbụ.
I am ready to give my life for you.	Adị m njikere inye ndụ m maka gị.
But that is a problem for my mother.	Ma nke ahụ bụ nsogbu ruo n’ebe nne m nọ.
I would like to go to school.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịga ụlọ akwụkwọ.
We need more help.	Anyị na-achọ enyemaka ọzọ.
These are a game.	Ndị a bụ otu egwuregwu.
The maximum benefit will be small.	Oke uru ga-adị obere.
Then he put the body inside.	Mgbe ahụ, o tinyere ahụ n'ime.
However, it is always done.	Otú ọ dị, a na-eme ya mgbe ọ bụla.
He thought he was ignorant.	O chere na ọ maghị ihe.
It is very useful for me.	Ọ bara ezigbo uru maka m.
That is a weakness.	Nke ahụ bụ ebe adịghị ike.
Within a month, she became pregnant.	N'ime otu ọnwa, ọ tụrụ ime.

On the first trip no one did that.	Na njem nke mbụ ọ nweghị onye na-eme nke ahụ.

We spent a week in a comfortable place.	Anyị nọrọ otu izu na ebe dị mma.
But it is certainly true.	Ma o doro anya na ọ bụ eziokwu.

Thank you so much for such kind words.	Daalụ nke ukwuu maka ụdị okwu ọma dị otú ahụ.

He was in perfect danger.	Ọ nọ n'ihe egwu zuru oke.
That is for that.	Nke ahụ bụ maka nke ahụ.

Of course, very few good people did.	N'ezie, ezigbo mmadụ ole na ole mere.
That was a big deal for us this week.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ihe nye anyị n'izu a.
Again, he asked the same question.	Ọzọ, ọ jụrụ ya otu ajụjụ ahụ.
No, it is very bad.	Mba, ọ dị ezigbo njọ.

A tragic accident happened.	Ihe mberede dị egwu mere.
The ambulance crashed again.	Igwe ihe mberede ahụ dara ọzọ.
It has an unparalleled effect on the human body.	Ọ nwere mmetụta na-enweghị atụ na ahụ mmadụ.

The passengers were angry.	Ndị njem ahụ were iwe.
Hopefully they will.	Olileanya na ha ga-eme.

Not for money.	Ọ bụghị maka ego.
The problem is not that companies have them.	Nsogbu abụghị na ụlọ ọrụ nwere ha.
The house was very nice and had everything we needed.	Ụlọ ahụ dị ezigbo mma ma nwee ihe niile dị anyị mkpa.
There is a better way.	Enwere ụzọ ka mma.
I may seem like something new to some people.	Enwere m ike ị dị ka ihe ọhụrụ nye ụfọdụ ndị.
These rules are very simple.	Iwu ndị a dị nnọọ mfe.
His teammates waited their turn.	Ndị otu ya chere oge ha.
But it would have required more than that.	Ma ọ gaara achọ karịa nke ahụ.
Consider what an example.	Ka ihe atụ gịnị.
I do not want this.	Achọghị m nke a.
It is that they are stronger.	Ọ bụ na ha dị ike karịa.
He may have mentioned my name.	O nwere ike ịbụ na o kwuru aha m.
That was the last time we talked.	Nke ahụ bụ oge ikpeazụ anyị kwuru okwu.
None of them are as happy as you.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha nwere obi ụtọ dị ka gị.
And lots of wine is good.	Na ọtụtụ mmanya dị mma.
He is a sweet dog.	Ọ bụ nkịta na-atọ ụtọ.
There is a feeling that we are one family.	Enwere mmetụta na anyị bụ otu ezinụlọ.
None of us were born there.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị a mụrụ n'ebe ahụ.
Those words.	Okwu ndị ahụ .

By the way, thank you everyone.	Site na ya, daalụ onye ọ bụla.

He called her to work one day.	Ọ kpọrọ ya ọrụ otu ụbọchị.
Great fun and easy to make.	Nnukwu ụtọ ma dị mfe ime.
Just a little bit of that.	Naanị obere ihe dị otú ahụ.
However, he was afraid to be human.	Otú ọ dị, ọ na-atụ egwu ịbụ mmadụ.
Wear your best shoes.	Yiri akpụkpọ ụkwụ gị kacha mma.

Once every two weeks is better.	Otu ugboro kwa izu abụọ ka mma.
These are higher than the observed value.	Ndị a dị elu karịa uru a hụrụ.
Last week, he had a big party.	N'izu gara aga, ọ mere nnukwu oriri.

But this is not the end of the story.	Ma, nke a abụghị ebe akụkọ ahụ kwụsịrị.
He said it was good.	O kwuru na ọ dị mma.

This is a side issue.	Nke a bụ okwu n'akụkụ.
This situation is not very strong.	Ọnọdụ a enweghị ezigbo ike.
It is the legs.	Ọ bụ ụkwụ.
Not every idea is good.	Ọ bụghị echiche ọ bụla dị mma.
He did not know whether to call his work or something else.	Ọ maghị ma ọ̀ bụ ịkpọ ọrụ ya ma ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
The trees are huge and green.	Osisi ndị ahụ dị oke na akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ.
Not a great idea.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu echiche.
His youngest brother is 14 years old.	Nwanne ya nke nta dị afọ iri na anọ.
I have done nothing wrong.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọjọọ m mere.
It makes headlines every time.	Ọ na-eme akụkọ n'ihu ihu oge ọ bụla.
But it is still a story.	Ma ọ ka bụ akụkọ.
The message is.	Ozi bụ.
I did not see, at first.	Ahụghị m, na mbụ.
He runs faster than he wants to run.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ ọsọ karịa ka ọ chọrọ ịgba ọsọ.
That sounds good, but it's not great.	Nke ahụ dị mma, mana ọ bụghị nnukwu.
He heard her speak.	Ọ nụrụ ka ọ na-ekwu.
Without it, there is no hope.	Ọ bụrụ na e nweghị, olileanya agaraghị adị.
That thing is very beautiful.	Ihe ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
This teacher asked one thing.	Onye nkuzi a jụrụ otu ihe.
People like to see themselves and what they do.	Ndị mmadụ na-enwe mmasị ịhụ onwe ha na ihe ha na-eme.
It was cold for a while.	Ọ jụrụ oyi nwa oge.
It will only be a few minutes of meeting.	Ọ ga-abụ naanị nkeji ole na ole nke nzukọ.
He told me that himself.	Ọ gwara m nke ahụ n'onwe ya.
We need the money.	Anyị chọrọ ego ahụ.
It will not be very important.	Ọ gaghị adị mkpa nke ukwuu.
We invited some old friends over for dinner.	Anyị kpọrọ ụfọdụ ndị enyi ochie ka ha bịa rie nri abalị.
It happened to each one of us.	O mere onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị.
So now, let's do this.	Ya mere ugbu a, ka anyị mee nke a.
It wasn't easy, but it happened.	Ọ dịghị mfe, ma o mere.
Things did not go well when he got home.	Ihe adịghị mma mgbe ọ rutere n'ụlọ.
Examples of distances and lengths.	Ihe atụ nke ebe dị anya na ogologo oge.
It will not be any problem for me.	Ọ gaghị abụ nsogbu ọ bụla nye m.
Thanks for the great news.	Daalụ maka nnukwu akụkọ.

The question is what to do next.	Ajụjụ bụ ihe a ga-eme ọzọ.
It was the second time in a day that he had heard the word.	Ọ bụ nke ugboro abụọ n'ime otu ụbọchị ọ nụrụ okwu ahụ.
Works for you.	Na-arụ ọrụ maka gị.
You get what you get.	Ị nweta ihe ị nwetara.
Their parents go abroad to see their son.	Ndị mụrụ ha na-aga mba ọzọ ịhụ nwa ha nwoke.
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
Maybe he can find something.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị ihe ọ pụrụ ịchọta.
It’s worse than any music movie.	Ọ dị njọ karịa ihe nkiri egwu ọ bụla.
It's fun work.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ ọrụ.
You want him to know that you love him.	Ị chọrọ ka ọ mara na ị hụrụ ya n'anya.
To help.	Iji nyere aka.
You have two different options for each day of the week.	Ị nwere ụzọ abụọ dị iche maka ụbọchị ọ bụla n'izu.
It started when he was little.	Ọ malitere mgbe ọ dị obere.
What we may think is irrelevant.	Ihe anyị nwere ike iche adịghị mkpa.
This is simple.	Nke a dị mfe.
In time, we loved it.	Ka oge na-aga, anyị hụrụ ya n'anya.
Nothing like that happens.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ na-eme.
At the restaurant, it was a different story.	N'ụlọ nri, ọ bụ akụkọ dị iche.
It's a good price.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ụgwọ.
They do not have that kind of power.	Ha enweghị ụdị ike ahụ.
Awesome city you have.	Obodo dị egwu ị nwere.
You are in your head here.	Ị nọ n'isi gị ebe a.
He was stopped by police.	Ndị uwe ojii kwụsịrị ya.
He shot everyone.	Ọ gbara onye ọ bụla.
Thanks for the great work !.	Daalụ maka ezigbo ọrụ!.
There is no water.	O nweghị mmiri ọ bụla.
You are doing an awesome job.	Ị na-arụ ọrụ dị egwu.
But there is no final story.	Mana ọ nweghị akụkọ ikpeazụ.
I saw someone.	Ahụrụ m mmadụ.
Be useful now.	Bụrụ onye bara uru ugbu a.
It just happens.	Ọ na-eme naanị.
There are two ways this can be done.	E nwere ụzọ abụọ e si eme ya.
But much remains to be done.	Mana ọtụtụ ihe ka ga-eme.
Wait for it.	Chere ya.
The accident happened during a rush hour.	Ihe mberede a mere n'oge ọsọ ọsọ.
I noticed this for a while.	Ahụrụ m nke a anya nwa oge.
He feels like he is a different person now.	Ọ dị ya ka ọ bụ onye dị iche ugbu a.
You will not like this story.	Akụkọ a agaghị amasị gị.
What kind of food do you like?	Kedu ụdị nri na-amasị gị?
This is a place of rest.	Nke a bụ ebe izu ike.
Get a good night's sleep.	Nwee ezigbo ụra.
This is what they set on fire.	Nke a ka ha gbara ọkụ.
It was a night of terror.	Ọ bụ abalị ụjọ.
Feelings made him a drug addict.	Mmetụta mere ya ọgwụ ọjọọ.
We stopped to get interested in the idea.	Anyị kwụsịrị iji nwee mmasị na echiche ahụ.
Beautiful homes.	Ụlọ ndị mara mma.
We thought we were doing it, but we weren’t doing it.	Anyị chere na anyị na-eme, mana anyị anaghị eme ya.
He is here for a reason.	Ọ nọ ebe a maka ihe kpatara ya.
We will do what is expected of us.	Anyị ga-eme ihe a tụrụ anya n’aka anyị.
There are currently no reports of this.	Enweghị akụkọ dị ugbu a maka ihe a.
He did not know what else he was thinking about.	Ọ maghị ihe ọzọ ọ na-eche banyere ya.
It never took.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ were.
He was born.	O bi nso.
That is in their eyes.	Nke ahụ dị n'anya ha.
You are my sister more.	Ị bụ nwanne m nwanyị karịa.
The couple has two children.	Di na nwunye ahụ nwere ụmụ abụọ.
This baby is here to stay.	Nwa ọhụrụ a nọ ebe a ka ọ nọrọ.
This is your sensible girl.	Nke a bụ nwa agbọghọ gị nwere ezi uche.
He needs distance.	Ọ chọrọ ebe dị anya.
One for the phone.	Otu maka ekwentị.
We never lost our temper because we loved him so much.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị were iwe n'ihi na anyị hụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
They did nothing.	Ha emeghị ihe ọ bụla.
Maybe a fish a year or more.	Ma eleghị anya, otu azụ̀ otu afọ ma ọ bụ karịa.
Without water, humans would not survive.	Enweghị mmiri, ụmụ mmadụ agaghị adị ndụ.
Nothing to do then.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla ime mgbe ahụ.
His family has one.	Ezinụlọ ya nwere otu.
But we did.	Ma anyị mere.
Then we just met him.	Mgbe ahụ, anyị ka zutere ya.
Vacations are plentiful.	Ebe ị ga-aga ezumike juru ebe niile.
Practice goes well !.	Omume na-eme nke ọma!.
I, thank you.	M, daalụ.
I do not know how to do this.	Amaghị m ka m ga-esi eme nke a.
No one is talking about your family name.	Ọ dịghị onye na-ekwu okwu banyere aha ezinụlọ gị.
Real money is needed.	A chọrọ ezigbo ego.
It is not long now.	Ọ dịghị anya ugbu a.
Not you.	Ọ bụghị gị.
All morals can only be judged by this case.	Ndị niile nwere omume ọma nwere ike ikpe ya naanị ikpe a.
By now, the whole community knows.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, obodo niile maara.
He wants you at home.	Ọ chọrọ gị n'ụlọ.
This is a difficult time.	Oge a siri ike.
He is the only one who is awake.	Ọ bụ naanị ya mụrụ anya.
First, my clear idea is that of a man.	Nke mbụ, echiche m doro anya bụ nke nwoke.
He knows nothing now.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ maara ugbu a.
But they will not see us right away.	Ma ha agaghị ahụ anyị ozugbo.
Take it for granted.	Were ya maka ihe bara uru.
He was obviously more than willing to leave.	O doro anya na ọ dị njikere karịa ịpụ.
This is what will happen during the event.	Nke a bụ ihe ga-eme n'oge ihe omume.
He says a lot.	Ọ na-ekwu nke ukwuu.
That is what makes them kids.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe na-eme ka ha bụrụ ụmụaka.
I will not be back there.	Agaghị m azụ azụ ebe ahụ.
So you will not see much.	Ya mere na ị gaghị ahụ ọtụtụ ihe.
Shortly before leaving the room.	Obere oge tupu ọ pụọ n'ọnụ ụlọ.
Only their reward is more money.	Naanị ụgwọ ọrụ ha bụ ego ka ukwuu.
Positive and emotional.	Ezigbo ma nwee mmetụta dị adị.
The work seemed unreasonable to them.	Ọrụ ahụ yiri ha enweghị ezi uche.
There are no major problems with either team.	Enweghị nnukwu nsogbu na otu abụọ ahụ.
We are all here and we love you.	Anyị niile nọ ebe a na anyị hụrụ gị n'anya.
And in the water.	Na n'ime mmiri.
He looked out the window.	O lere anya na windo.
This is still happening.	Nke a ka na-eme.
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
Unlike us.	Ọ dịghị ka anyị ndị ọzọ.
Company is our highest priority.	Ụlọ ọrụ bụ ihe kacha anyị mkpa.
He was surprised at this company.	O juru ya anya na ụlọ ọrụ a.
I immediately fell in love.	Ahụrụ m n'anya ozugbo.
This could be for three reasons.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ n'ihi ihe atọ.
But in the end, he was right.	Ma o mechara bụrụ na o kwuru eziokwu.
I know it won't work.	Amaara m na ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ.
I think you will be happy to see me.	Echere m na obi ga-adị gị ụtọ ịhụ m.
Not much more.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ.
It's hard, smart.	O siri ike, mara ihe.
We must act.	Anyị ga-eme ihe.
Of course he loves to be wanted.	N'ezie ọ hụrụ n'anya ka a chọrọ.
It will never happen.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-eme.
At times, it seemed like it was working for four people.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ dị ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ mmadụ anọ.
I have those.	Enwere m ndị ahụ.
It's a bad thing.	Ọ bụ ihe na-adịghị mma.
But I can't find it.	Ma enweghị m ike ịhụ ya.
I feel like I have a lot to say.	Ọ dị m ka m nwere ọtụtụ ihe ikwu.
I almost left.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka m pụọ.
Thank you so much for being there for it.	Daalụ nke ukwuu maka ịnọ ebe ahụ maka ya.
It may be the first or it may be the modern.	Ọ nwere ike ịbụ nke mbụ ma ọ bụ ọ nwere ike ịbụ nke oge a.
They are impossible.	Ha agaghị ekwe omume.
Still, his words are very important.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, okwu ya dị ezigbo mkpa.
The reasons are as follows.	Ihe kpatara ya bụ ndị a.
Money is not everything, you know.	Ego abụghị ihe niile, ị maara.
Things were good then.	Ihe dị mma mgbe ahụ.
Sometimes for good, sometimes for bad.	Mgbe ụfọdụ maka mma, mgbe ụfọdụ maka njọ.
I want feelings.	Achọrọ m mmetụta.
However, he faces these challenges.	Otú ọ dị, ọ na-enwe nsogbu ndị a.
He is still alive.	Ọ ka dị ndụ.
But not happy feet.	Ma enweghị obi ụtọ ụkwụ.
The story will be the same.	Akụkọ ahụ ga-abụ otu ihe ahụ.
Like this here, up and down.	Dị ka nke a ebe a, elu na ala.
It is perfect.	O zuru oke.
Awesome music.	Egwu egwu.
Be a living example of it.	Bụrụ ihe atụ dị ndụ nke ya.
This is easier said than done.	Nke a dị mfe ikwu karịa ime.
But there is a problem with that.	Mana enwere nsogbu na nke ahụ.
His thoughts sounded foolish to me.	Echiche ya yiri m nzuzu.
Good door, handy with everything.	Ezigbo ọnụ ụzọ, nke nwere aka na ihe niile.
Now he understands a lot of horror movies.	Ugbu a ọ ghọtara ọtụtụ egwu ihe nkiri.
People do not know about these words, it seems.	Ndị mmadụ amaghị maka okwu ndị a, ọ dị ka.
I still have some knowledge of the event.	Ahụ́ ka na-ama m banyere ihe omume ahụ.
It was long, but not long.	Ọ dị ogologo, ma ọ bụghị ogologo oge.
We like to be told what to do.	Ọ na-amasị anyị ka a gwa anyị ihe anyị ga-eme.
We never knew.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị maara.
That is the law of the land.	Nke ahụ bụ iwu obodo.
This is not about you.	Nke a abụghị gbasara gị.
It was the last thing on the ball.	Ọ bụ ihe ikpeazụ na bọọlụ.
If the kids did it from home, you got them.	Ọ bụrụ na ụmụaka mere ya site n'ụlọ, ị nwetara ha.
His anger is still there.	Iwe ya ka dị.
It is not an impossible task.	Ọ bụghị ọrụ agaghị ekwe omume.
He had a gunshot wound to the back.	Ọkụ gbara ya n'azụ.
This should not be more than once or twice a month.	Nke a agaghị abụ ihe karịrị otu ugboro ma ọ bụ ugboro abụọ n'ọnwa.
The doctors told her to rest.	Ndị dọkịta gwara ya ka ọ zuru ike.
But it is not so.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
Still, this is different.	N'agbanyeghị nke a, nke a dị iche.
Photos this week.	Foto n'izu a.
They are good in the future.	Ha dị mma n'ihu.
This job requires a lot of travel.	Ọrụ a chọrọ ọtụtụ njem.
The issue is very close to me.	Okwu ahụ dị m ezigbo nso.
There were no people eating.	Enweghị ndị na-eri nri.
I can't see any good in anyone.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ihe ọma ọ bụla n'ime onye ọ bụla.
You do not hear a car.	Ị naghị anụ otu ụgbọ ala.
They are good.	Ha dị mma.
But that is what they did.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe ha mere.
He will never be seen again in the movie.	Agaghị ahụ ya ọzọ na ihe nkiri ahụ.
But now it is here.	Ma ugbu a, otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
I just know it, that's all.	M nnọọ maara ya, bụ ihe niile.
You are not good.	Ị adịghị mma.
You go to your room.	Ị gara n'ọnụ ụlọ gị.
They went to good school.	Ha gara ezigbo ụlọ akwụkwọ.
And here's one thing everyone can be really happy about.	Na ebe a bụ otu ihe onye ọ bụla nwere ike inwe ezigbo obi ụtọ.
And earn money.	Ma nweta ego.
Man cannot be anything.	Mmadụ apụghị ịbụ ihe ọ bụla ọ chọrọ.
That is exactly what is happening here.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ezie ihe na-eme ebe a.
But something else.	Ma ihe ọzọ.
You do not know.	Ị maghị.
It makes sense.	Ọ bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
Just a minute.	Naanị otu nkeji.
He will want his strength.	Ọ ga-achọ ike ya.
What you said is very good.	Ihe ị kwuru dị nnọọ mma.
Something very.	Ihe dị nnọọ.
On the way, he heard one.	Ka ọ na-aga, ọ nụrụ otu.
That was another very important practice of mine.	Nke ahụ bụ omume ọzọ dị oke mkpa nke m.
I will miss him.	Aga m atụ uche ya.
You may know.	Ị nwere ike ịma.
This is the one who should be doing this music.	Nke a bụ onye kwesịrị ịdị na-eme egwu a.
She is just a child.	Ọ bụ naanị nwa.
I know very well that you are honest.	Amaara m nke ukwuu ka ị na-ekwu eziokwu.
Not his place.	Ọ bụghị ebe ya.
I'm glad we live in that country.	Obi dị m ụtọ na anyị bi na mba ahụ.
He should adjust his position if he wants to.	O kwesịrị ka ọnọdụ ya ma ọ bụrụ na ọ chọrọ ya.
Winter is near.	O doro anya na oge oyi na-abịa.
For a few minutes, nothing happened.	N'ihi na nkeji ole na ole, ọ dịghị ihe mere.
However, he declined to say when.	Otú ọ dị, ọ jụrụ ikwu mgbe.
Along the way, they met many families.	Na njem ahụ, ha zutere ọtụtụ ezinụlọ.
This event seemed to interest him.	Ihe omume a yiri ka ọ masịrị ya.
He said it quickly.	O kwuru ya ngwa ngwa.
Stay.	Nọrọ.
We must do all we can.	Anyị kwesịrị ime ike anyị niile.
He goes home.	Ọ na-aga n'ụlọ.
What do you think of the game?	Kedu ihe ị chere maka egwuregwu ahụ?
I want to see you.	Achọrọ m ịhụ gị.
Everyone loves it.	Onye ọ bụla hụrụ ya n'anya.
You do what you need to do.	Ị na-eme ihe dị gị mkpa ime.
However, as a group, they can achieve a lot.	Otú ọ dị, dị ka otu, ha nwere ike nweta ọtụtụ ihe.
I told him first.	Agwara m ya mbụ.
We could have been happier.	Anyị gaara enwe obi ụtọ.
They have a lot of fun.	Ha nwere ọtụtụ egwu egwu.
This is very close.	Nke a dị ezigbo nso.
If so, he evidently did not know it well.	Ọ bụrụ otú ahụ, o doro anya na ọ maghị ya nke ọma.
Not here or there.	Ọ bụghị ebe a ma ọ bụ ebe ahụ.
You have a lot of questions, don't you?	Ị nwere ọtụtụ ajụjụ, ọ bụghị gị?
That was the only time.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị oge.
It is important to be hungry.	Ọ dị mkpa inwe agụụ.
There is nothing wrong with the plane.	Ọ nweghị ihe dị njọ na ụgbọ elu ahụ.
He did not want to tell anyone.	Ọ chọghị ịgwa onye ọ bụla.
There is no other way.	Ọ dịghị ụzọ ọzọ nke a pụrụ isi mee.
That seems to be the case with them.	Nke ahụ yiri ka ọ masịrị ha.
He sat as the others, face to face, waited.	Ọ nọdụ ka ndị ọzọ, anya n'ihu, chere.
Thanks for the trial, by the way.	Daalụ maka ikpe ahụ, n'agbanyeghị.
Or stay away from my studies.	Ma ọ bụ nọrọ onwe gị na ọmụmụ ihe m.
He was surprised when he asked her.	O juru ya anya mgbe ọ jụrụ ya.
But those things happened.	Ma, ihe ndị ahụ mere.
But worse, my friends.	Ma ihe ka njọ, ndị enyi m.
Those who need help that will help them up.	Ndị chọrọ aka nke ga-enyere ha aka elu.
But it may not last long.	Mana ọ nwere ike ọ gaghị anọ ogologo oge.
Not that the money is bad in itself.	Ọ bụghị na ego ahụ bụ ihe ọjọọ n'onwe ya.
The length of time we are talking about here is meaningless.	Ogologo nke anyị na-ekwu maka ya ebe a, ọ nweghị isi.
In this case, this is ancient history.	Na nke a, nke a bụ akụkọ ihe mere eme ochie.
I went with both of them.	M wee na ha abụọ.
What is, is still.	Gịnị bụ, ka dị.
The game is fun.	Egwuregwu na-atọ ụtọ.

They told each other that they loved each other.	Ha gwara ibe ha na ha hụrụ ibe ha n’anya.
We do the story.	Anyị na-eme akụkọ ahụ.
It went further than that.	Ọ gara n'ihu karịa nke ahụ.
The work journey was difficult.	Njem ọrụ ahụ siri ike.
Sometimes that happens.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, nke ahụ na-eme.
He said you are still here.	O wee sị na ị ka nọ ebe a.
He could not understand why he wanted to talk to them.	O nweghị ike iche ihe mere o ji chọọ ịgwa ha okwu.
I love you so much, my child.	Ahụrụ m gị n'anya nke ukwuu, nwa m.

He thought the car belonged to my boyfriend.	O chere na ụgbọ ala ahụ bụ nke enyi m nwoke.
Twenty all together.	Iri abụọ niile ọnụ.
He does not need the money.	Ego ahụ adịghị ya mkpa.
It was a few days ago.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị ole na ole gara aga.
The fish were swimming happily now.	Azụ ahụ nọ na-egwu mmiri na-enwe obi ụtọ ugbu a.
Her smile is amazing.	Ọmụmụ ọnụ ọchị ya na-atụ n'anya.
Which is very serious.	Nke dị oke njọ.
They are, otherwise, about our lives.	Ha bụ, ma ọ bụghị, gbasara ndụ anyị.
And inside, is this book.	Na n'ime, bụ akwụkwọ a.
At the time, he spoke very little.	N'oge ahụ, ọ na-ekwu obere okwu.

The matter lasted a few months.	Okwu ahụ were ọnwa ole na ole.
Maybe he knew what was coming.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ maara ihe na-abịa.
You will have to use less because you will need less.	Ị ga-eji obere ihe n'ihi na ị ga-achọ obere.
You can not really do this.	Ị nweghị ike ime nke a n'ezie.
It belongs to her grandmother.	Ọ bụ nke nne nne ya.

We want her to know that we love her.	Anyị chọrọ ka ọ mara na anyị hụrụ ya n’anya.
In practice, it certainly is.	Na omume, o doro anya na ọ ga-abụ.

He thought he would be a boy.	O chere na ọ ga-abụ nwa nwoke.

However, not for me.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị maka m.

We want them to be as simple as possible.	Anyị chọrọ ka ha dị mfe dị ka o kwere mee.

The important thing is that they are both good.	Isi ihe dị mkpa bụ na ha abụọ dị mma.
You know you love it.	Ị maara na ị hụrụ ya n'anya.
But there is nothing to do about it now.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla ime banyere ya ugbu a.
Probably you will.	Eleghị anya ị ga-abụ.
Meanwhile, there are hungry people everywhere.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, e nwere ndị agụụ na-agụ n’ebe niile.
I can help.	Enwere m ike inye aka.
He is a good musician.	Ọ bụ onye na-agụ egwu nke ọma.
The surroundings are small.	Gburugburu ya dị obere.
The patient had no family history.	Onye ọrịa ahụ enweghị akụkọ ezinụlọ ọ bụla.
You're better at it.	Ị ka m mma na ya.
He had something to say that he wanted to talk to.	O nwere ihe ọ na-ekwu na ọ chọrọ ịgwa mmadụ okwu.
I know exactly how to do it.	Amaara m nke ọma otu esi eme ya.
There are many, many other problems with that idea.	Enwere ọtụtụ, ọtụtụ nsogbu ndị ọzọ na echiche ahụ.
I do not think much about it.	Echeghị m ọtụtụ ihe banyere ya.
Our town is small and friendly.	Obodo anyị dị obere na enyi.
Is it dangerous.	Ọ dị egwu.
We can take a short break.	Anyị nwere ike were obere oge ezumike.
You can talk to the police.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa ndị uwe ojii okwu.
We are closer.	Anyị nọ nso karịa.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị njọ n'ihu ya.
Now they are weak and fearful.	Ugbu a, ha bụ ndị na-adịghị ike na egwu.
A football game is going to have an amazing performance today.	Otu egwuregwu bọọlụ ga-eme omume dị egwu taa.

This can be seen in the examples given.	Enwere ike ịhụ nke a na ihe atụ ndị e nyere.

He stopped near the back.	Ọ kwụsịrị ebe dị nso n'azụ.
He would never do it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-eme ya.
I'm not afraid.	A naghị atụ m oke egwu.
He does a lot during games, without a lot of rewards.	Ọ na-eme ọtụtụ ihe n'oge egwuregwu, na-enweghị ọtụtụ ụgwọ ọrụ.
He wondered how we could do it	Ọ nọ na-eche otú anyị ga-esi eme ya ma ọ́ bụghị ya
If it works, fine.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ na-arụ ọrụ, mma.
The director entered the theater.	Onye isi ahụ banyere n'ime ụlọ ihe nkiri ahụ.

But none of that.	Ma ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ya.
This, of course, this is it.	Nke a, n'ezie, nke a bụ ya.
Now, however, there are new challenges.	Otú ọ dị, ugbu a, e nwere ihe isi ike ọhụrụ.
He wants you for the same.	Ọ chọrọ gị maka otu ihe ahụ.

Sometimes they are both at the same time.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha abụọ n'otu oge.
It does not work.	Ọ naghị aga nke ọma.
It would be nice if he did, but he doesn’t do it.	Ọ ga-adị mma ma ọ bụrụ na ọ mere, mana ọ naghị eme ya.
They have no idea.	Ha enweghị echiche n'ime ha.
There are a few ways you can do this.	Enwere ụzọ ole na ole ị nwere ike isi mee nke a.
This car is in my hands.	Ụgbọ ala a dị n'aka m.
But he wanted more.	Ma ọ chọrọ ihe karịrị nke ahụ.

He pointed to a distance.	Ọ tụrụ aka n'otu ebe dị anya.
People need truth and courage.	Eziokwu na obi ike dị ndị mmadụ mkpa.
There are two main reasons for this.	E nwere isi ihe abụọ kpatara nke a.
I do not want anything else.	Achọghị m ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
It is a cold day.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị oyi.
He became very angry.	O wee were ezigbo iwe.
This can take hours.	Nke a nwere ike were ọtụtụ awa.
What a beautiful first year.	Kedu afọ mbụ mara mma.
This goes for the house and the body.	Nke a na-aga maka ụlọ na anụ ahụ.

That's your style.	Nke ahụ bụ ụdị gị.
I read them over and over again.	M na-agụ ha ugboro ugboro.
The house was surrounded by trees.	Osisi gbara ụlọ ahụ gburugburu.
There could be several reasons for this.	Enwere ike inwe ọtụtụ ihe kpatara nke a.
To many readers they will be like.	Nye ọtụtụ ndị na-agụ ha ga-adị ka .
He knew that there would be no sleep tonight.	Ọ ma na ụra agaghị adị n'abalị a.
The main difference.	Ihe dị iche bụ isi.
So the story goes on.	Ya mere akụkọ ahụ na-aga n'ihu.
The company is well known for its shoes.	A maara ụlọ ọrụ ahụ nke ọma maka akpụkpọ ụkwụ ya.
It can be anything or anyone.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọ bụla ma ọ bụ onye ọ bụla.

Everything is nothing.	Ihe niile abụghị ihe ọ bụla.

Not in front, but behind it.	Ọ bụghị n'ihu, ma n'azụ ya.
He loves us.	Ọ hụrụ anyị n'anya.
It is easy to say that.	Ọ dị mfe ikwu otú ahụ.
One expects to be scared.	Onye na-atụ anya na-atụ ụjọ.
There is only so much to gain.	Ọ dị naanị ọtụtụ ihe a ga-enwe.
My money was stolen!	E zuru ego m!
The earth does not go anywhere.	Ala anaghị aga ebe ọ bụla.
I know his first name.	Ama m aha mbụ ya.
The difference of the way we approach these books is this.	Ihe dị iche nke ụzọ anyị si aga akwụkwọ ndị a bụ nke a.
He does not speak to her.	Ọ naghị agwa ya okwu.
Now, if that’s what you want to say, fine.	Ugbu a, ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ bụ ihe ịchọrọ ikwu, ọ dị mma.
I do not shop there.	Anaghị m azụ ahịa ebe ahụ.
Tomorrow is his birthday.	Echi bụ ụbọchị ọmụmụ ya.

Now, we are just the bosses.	Ugbu a, anyị bụ naanị ndị isi.
Of course, many, many times.	N'ezie, ọtụtụ, ọtụtụ ugboro.
Soon we reached our destination.	N’oge na-adịghị anya, anyị rutere ebe anyị na-aga.
Very tasty and very tasty.	Ezigbo ụtọ na ezigbo ụtọ.
Because they seem to know more than I do.	N'ihi na ọ dị ka ha maara karịa m.
It just happens to me.	Ọ na-eme m naanị.
So that’s beautiful.	Ya mere nke ahụ mara mma.
It is widespread.	Ọ gbasara na mba niile.

He told her about her childhood.	Ọ gwara ya banyere oge ọ bụ nwata.
I'll tell you one more time.	Aga m agwa gị ya otu oge ọzọ.
I want to say the same thing about you.	M na-achọ ikwu otu ihe ahụ gbasara gị.
Not in a bad way.	Ọ bụghị n'ụzọ ọjọọ.
It does not make the people bad or the good.	Ọ naghị eme ka ndị ahụ dị njọ ma ọ bụ ndị dị mma.
Another movie is likely to have taken place then and there.	Ihe nkiri ọzọ yikarịrị ka ọ̀ mere mgbe ahụ na ebe ahụ.

The drug's effects eventually subsided.	Ike ọgwụ ahụ mechara kwụsị.

We could have done this on our own.	Anyị gaara eme nke a n'onwe anyị.
About me, he said.	Banyere m, o kwuru.
Everything is stupid.	Ihe niile bụ nzuzu.
Then he stopped.	Mgbe ahụ ọ kwụsịrị.
There are no tears here.	Anya mmiri adịghị n'ebe a.

It doesn't matter in the story.	Ọ dịghị mkpa na akụkọ ahụ.
Here is how we do it.	Nke a bụ ụzọ anyị ga-esi mee.

Welcome to the game!	Nnọọ na egwuregwu egwuregwu!
The current case is different.	Okwu ikpe dị ugbu a dị iche.
He is very surprised.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
He is a handsome man.	Ọ bụ nwoke mara mma.
It was given a name.	O nwere ihe mere e ji nye ya aha ahụ.
He had weaknesses like no other.	O nwere adịghị ike dị ka onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
The plan is perfect, he thought.	Atụmatụ ahụ zuru oke, o chere.

And yet, this is different.	Ma n'agbanyeghị nke a, nke a dị iche.

But not about it.	Ma ọ bụghị banyere ya.
The company has financial problems.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ nwere nsogbu ego.
They are two different words.	Ha bụ okwu abụọ dị iche iche.
Soon, they realized that she could not.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, ha ghọtara na ọ nweghị ike.
The situation is dire.	Ọnọdụ ahụ siri ike.
He looked into my eyes.	O lere anya n'anya m.
Of what value is it?	Olee uru ọ bara?
We are beyond such things.	Anyị karịrị ihe ndị dị otú ahụ.

He gave a little.	Ọ nyere ntakịrị.
He enjoys cooking and living.	Ọ na-amasị ya isi nri na ime ụlọ.
But this is new.	Mana nke a dị ọhụrụ.

You need it now, and need it quickly.	Ị chọrọ ya ugbu a, ma chọọ ya ngwa ngwa.

A work accident ended his life.	Ihe mberede ọrụ mere ka ndụ ya kwụsị.
In a few years that will be me.	N'ime afọ ole na ole nke ahụ ga-abụ m.
But that is not what he said.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị ihe o kwuru.
He died suddenly.	Ọ nwụrụ na mberede.
If you are wanted, you are loved.	Ọ bụrụ na achọrọ gị, a hụrụ gị n'anya.
You won't see this man for lunch.	Ị gaghị ahụ nwoke a maka nri ehihie.

The prison was known for its brutal nature.	A maara ụlọ mkpọrọ ahụ n'ihi ọnọdụ ọjọọ ya.

For his help.	Maka enyemaka ya.

It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
It doesn't seem like much to say.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ ikwu.
My opinion is this.	Echiche m bụ nke a.
The boy is doing well.	Nwa nwoke ahụ na-eme nke ọma.
The rent is too high.	Ụgwọ ụlọ ahụ dị oke elu.
This room is the perfect place for a study.	Ime ụlọ a bụ ebe kacha mma maka ọmụmụ ihe.
Police surrounded the company car.	Ndị uwe ojii gbara ụgbọ ala ụlọ ọrụ ahụ gburugburu.

He knows how to run the race.	Ọ maara ka esi agba ọsọ ahụ.
However, this is not a problem.	Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị nsogbu.
Of course, it is very different.	N'ezie, ọ bụ nnọọ iche.

He said something funny.	O kwuru ihe na-atọ ọchị.

I am awesome at everything.	Adị m egwu na ihe niile.
I met other women.	M zutere ụmụ nwanyị ndị ọzọ.
The clock is ticking.	Elekere ahụ kwụsịrị.
We know it doesn’t exist, but that doesn’t matter anymore.	Anyị maara na ọ bụghị adị, ma nke ahụ adịghị mkpa ọzọ.

They all sat down.	Ha niile nọdụ ala.
Which is nice.	Nke dị mma.
He runs as fast as he can.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ ka ọ dị ike.
The problem is internal.	Nsogbu dị n'ime.

His condition is unknown at this time.	Amaghị ọnọdụ ya ugbu a.
This is just what we want.	Nke a bụ naanị ihe anyị chọrọ.

As soon as you are well.	Ozugbo ị dị mma.
That is because of interest.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ihi mmasị kemgbe.

Of course it did.	N'ezie o mere.
None of them suggested that they should not.	Ọ dịghị otu ọ bụla tụrụ aro ka ha ghara.

He behaved like a child.	O mere omume ka nwata.
One thing happened in front of me.	Otu ihe merenụ bụ n'ihu m.
Maybe it's wine and food.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ mmanya na nri.

A journalist was told not to travel alone.	A gwara onye nta akụkọ ka ọ ghara ịga njem naanị ya.
He liked this room.	Ime ụlọ a masịrị ya.
You still got paid.	Ị ka nwetara ụgwọ.
There is so much to learn.	E nwere ọtụtụ ihe ga-adị ọhụrụ.
Not where he thinks.	Ọ bụghị n'ebe ọ na-eche.
I say sit down.	Asị m nọdụ ala.

Still, he refused to compromise.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ jụrụ ikweta.
He could not.	O nweghị ike.
The store is only a few blocks away.	Ụlọ ahịa ahụ dị naanị ụzọ ole na ole.
Or early yet.	Ma ọ bụ n'oge ma.
You do not have them.	Ị nweghị ha.
This is the way it is now.	Otú a ka ọ dị ugbu a.
I can't give a gift to just one man.	Enweghị m ike inye naanị otu nwoke onyinye.
Only then can you get an idea of ​​what is required.	Naanị mgbe ahụ ị nwere ike nweta echiche gbasara ihe achọrọ.
It is true, as is life.	Ọ bụ eziokwu, dị ka ndụ.
Inside the tree.	N'ime osisi.
They know it.	Ha maara ya.
There are three problems with this.	Enwere nsogbu atọ na nke a.
The boy may have a good idea.	Nwa nwoke ahụ nwere ike inwe ezigbo echiche.
Important.	Ihe dị mkpa.
In their own sleep.	Na ụra nke ha.
Everyone should know this.	Onye ọ bụla kwesịrị ịma nke a.
You want more.	Ị chọrọ karịa.
It is very simple.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe.
Where are you going?	Kedu ebe ị ga-aga.
He doesn't really want to be here.	Ọ chọghị n'ezie ịnọ ebe a.
Of course, it would be very foolish.	N'ezie, ọ ga-abụ nnọọ nzuzu.
The story is simple.	Akụkọ ahụ dị mfe.
He never took a boat.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ were ụgbọ mmiri.
But again, that is not good.	Mana ọzọ, nke ahụ adịghị mma.
They went out of the way.	Ha si n’ụzọ pụọ.
This land cannot be irrigated.	Ala a enweghị ike ịgba mmiri.
It's better to have it together, girl.	Ọ ka mma ị nweta ya ọnụ, nwa agbọghọ.
It's about community music.	Ọ gbasara egwu obodo.
Sometimes it is small.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ dị obere.
Obviously we are on the other side.	O doro anya na anyị nọ n'akụkụ nke ọzọ.
I met him in the room.	M zutere ya n'ime ụlọ.
When is the best time to do this?	Kedu mgbe kacha mma ime nke a?
I made them worse.	M ka ha njọ.
If necessary.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mkpa.
Then a doctor was called.	Mgbe ahụ, a kpọrọ dọkịta.
Despite the movie.	N'agbanyeghị ihe nkiri ahụ.
He would never look like himself, really.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-adị ka onwe ya, n'ezie.

It will be difficult.	Ọ ga-esi ike.
It's really better over the last few years.	Ọ ka mma n'ezie n'ime afọ ole na ole gara aga.

We work hard.	Anyị na-arụ ọrụ siri ike.
Everyone here is like that.	Ndị niile nọ ebe a dị otú ahụ.
It is very stupid.	Ọ bụ nnọọ nzuzu.
Apparently women.	O doro anya na ụmụ nwanyị.
Today, it seems to be happening.	Taa, ọ dị ka ihe a na-eme eme.
The heat surprised me.	Okpomọkụ juru m anya.
I don't have it, but it goes.	Enweghị m ya, mana ọ na-aga.
There was no teacher present.	Ọ nweghị onye nkuzi nọ ebe ahụ.
He will have another 'meeting' with the police, as he called it.	Ya na ndị uwe ojii ga-enwe 'nzukọ' ọzọ, dị ka ọ kpọrọ ya.
Then no one said anything else.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ dịghị onye kwuru ọzọ.
Probably for many of them.	Ma eleghị anya, maka ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
We made it together and it was delicious.	Anyị mere ya ọnụ na ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
Play well.	Na-egwu nke ọma.
It is not wanted.	Achọghị ya.
I think he was the only one.	Echere m na ọ bụ naanị ya.
That is not their job.	Nke ahụ abụghị isi ọrụ ha.
Of course, why not.	N'ezie, gịnị kpatara na ọ bụghị.
I do not want to be.	Achọghị m ịbụ.
It is a fact of life.	Ọ bụ eziokwu nke ndụ.
But every time my mother went to the hospital she tried.	Ma mgbe ọ bụla nne m gara ụlọ ọgwụ ọ na-agbalị.
You can be special.	Ị nwere ike ịbụ onye pụrụ iche.
But there is one problem.	Mana enwere otu nsogbu.
Only then did the fear stop.	Naanị mgbe ahụ, egwu kwụsịrị.
But we have limits.	Ma anyị nwere oke.
But he said there was not enough work to go around.	Mana o kwuru na enweghị ọrụ zuru oke iji na-aga gburugburu.
So give me a smile.	Ya mere, nyere m anya ọchị.
But, in some ways it is.	Ma, n'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ọ bụ.
No, no, not this man.	Mba, mba, ọ bụghị nwoke a.
Work, school sleep.	Ọrụ, ụra ụlọ akwụkwọ.

Many colors.	Ọtụtụ agba.
Friendly friends.	Enyi na enyi dị mma.

If he does not like it, he may not like it at all.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ naghị adị ya mma, ọ ga-abụ na ọ naghị adị ya.
He knew what the idea meant.	Ọ maara ihe echiche ahụ kwesịrị ikwu.
When they did, it was good.	Mgbe ha mere, ọ dị mma.
Of course dogs.	N'ezie nkịta.
My heart was warm within me.	Obi m dị ọkụ n'ime m.
A city can make a man.	Obodo nwere ike ime ka mmadụ.

The two men ran away.	Mmadụ abụọ a gbara ọsọ.
Good book.	Ezigbo akwụkwọ.
That is the only reason.	Ọ bụ naanị ya kpatara ya.
He has no job and wants to travel.	O nweghị ọrụ ma chọọ ịga njem.
Sometimes that really happens.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, nke ahụ na-eme n'ezie.
His past and family history are unparalleled.	Akụkọ ya gara aga na akụkọ ezinụlọ ya enweghị atụ.
Not bad type.	Ọ bụghị ụdị ọjọọ.
Today, many companies do not function properly.	Taa, ọtụtụ ụlọ ọrụ anaghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma.

He wanted to live again.	Ọ chọrọ ịdị ndụ ọzọ.

This was understood as lack of reward.	A ghọtara nke a dị ka enweghị ụgwọ ọrụ.

That is not the way it works.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka o si arụ ọrụ.

None of us can be happy for a long time, doing anything.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị pụrụ inwe obi ụtọ ruo ogologo oge, na-eme ihe ọ bụla.
It looks like an accident.	Ọ dị ka ihe mberede.

So it goes on.	Ya mere ọ na-aga n'ihu.

That is a big deal.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ihe.
Dinner was delicious.	Nri abalị dị ụtọ.
You are afraid of him.	Ị na-atụ ya egwu.

Now that’s tough.	Ugbu a nke ahụ siri ike.
Today is our day.	Taa bụ ụbọchị anyị.
Occasionally there is a party here and there.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, oriri na ọṅụṅụ ebe a na ebe ahụ.
In a word, the crowd was amazed.	Na otu okwu, igwe mmadụ juru.
Make it.	Mee ka ọ bụrụ.

When bad things happen to others.	Mgbe ihe ọjọọ na-eme ndị ọzọ.
There is more now.	Enwere ihe ọzọ ugbu a.
But they are.	Ma ha bụ.
You can tell the truth, he said.	I nwere ike ikwu eziokwu, ka o kwuru.

But there is an idea.	Ma e nwere echiche nke ọ pụrụ ịbụ.
At one point in his life, he realized that he did not exist.	N'otu ebe n'ime ya, ọ maara na ọ bụghị adị.

If they don't like our rules, they should leave.	Ọ bụrụ na iwu anyị anaghị amasị ha, ha kwesịrị ịpụ.

He handed her the letter.	O nyere ya akwụkwọ ozi ahụ.

Clothe clothes for those in need.	Yiri ndị nọ ná mkpa uwe.

His anger was burning.	Iwe ya dị ọkụ.
The restaurant is packed.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ juru n'ọnụ.
What good did he do ?.	Kedu ihe ọma ọ mere?.
This is true for everyone.	Nke a bụ eziokwu maka onye ọ bụla.
The talk continues.	Okwu na-aga n'ihu.
I have my doubts.	Enwere m obi abụọ.
It is so.	Otú a ka ọ dị.
What it really is.	Ihe ọ bara uru n'ezie.
I don't want to do that.	Achọghị m ime nke ahụ.
That is because of medication.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ihi ọgwụ.
It is expensive.	Ọ dị oke ọnụ.
These are the few moments that make me smile.	Ndị a bụ oge ole na ole na-eme m ọnụ ọchị.
However, they are not the only ones.	Otú ọ dị, ha abụghị naanị ha.
There is no other reason.	O nweghị ihe ọzọ kpatara ya.
We can't see anything.	Anyị enweghị ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla.
Your work is impossible with just one hand.	Ọrụ gị agaghị ekwe omume na naanị otu aka.
He was a human.	Ọ bụ mmadụ.
That is a spiritual issue.	Nke ahụ bụ okwu gbasara mmụọ.
His style of teaching is low.	Ụdị nkuzi ya dị ala.
He has a history with him.	Ya na ya nwere akụkọ ihe mere eme.
They are here to help.	Ha nọ ebe a iji nyere aka.
I am a man, but my sister has just given birth.	Abụ m nwoke, mana nwanne m nwanyị ka mụrụ nwa.
However, this has both advantages and disadvantages.	Otú ọ dị, nke a nwere ma ihe dị mma na nke na-adịghị mma.
The weather is hot.	Ihu igwe kacha ọkụ.
That is what we want now.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị chọrọ ugbu a.
At the very least, it casts doubt on its existence.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, na-eme ka e nwee obi abụọ banyere ịdị adị ya.
This is what your doctor will want.	Nke a bụ ihe dọkịta gị ga-achọ.
Often, of course.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, n'ezie.
Very angry, very angry.	Oke iwe, oke iwe.
Every story is in the first person.	Akụkọ ọ bụla dị na onye mbụ.
You will want to do it.	Ị ga-achọ ime ya.
Perfect for us.	Zuru oke maka anyị.
And the history of the night.	Na akụkọ ihe mere eme nke abalị.
He left the building.	Ọ hapụrụ ụlọ ahụ.
We are not afraid.	Anyị adịghị egwu.
We want him to leave.	Anyị chọrọ ka ọ pụọ.
Of course, this is not an easy task.	N'ezie, nke a abụghị ọrụ dị mfe.
From everyone, all of you.	Site na onye ọ bụla, unu niile.
I think we will use it on wood.	Echere m na anyị ga-eji ya na osisi.
I am going for a drive.	M na-aga maka ụgbọala.
But it should be different.	Ma o kwesịrị ịdị iche.
I will not allow him to do this.	Agaghị m ekwe ka o mee nke a.
These are awesome ground hands.	Ndị a bụ aka ala dị egwu.
There were virtually no photos of the attack.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ dịghị foto nke ọgụ ahụ.
This story speaks to an unfortunate event.	Akụkọ a na-ekwu maka ihe omume na-adịghị mma.
He wanted to live.	Ọ chọrọ ịdị ndụ.
I am hungry.	Agụụ na-agụ m.
The people there are very friendly.	Ndị bi n’ebe ahụ na-enwe nnọọ omume enyi.
He knew he was right.	Ọ ma na o kwuru eziokwu.
Let's see how.	Ka anyị hụ otú.
That's what my colleagues did.	Otú ahụ ka ndị ọrụ ibe m mere.
But it is what it is.	Ma, ọ bụ ihe ọ bụ.
Maybe I won't see one.	Eleghị anya agaghị m ahụ otu.
Go faster than usual.	Gaa ngwa ngwa karịa ka ọ dị.
I want to see you all day.	Achọrọ m ịhụ gị ụbọchị niile.
You are not alone in this.	Ọ bụghị naanị gị na nke a.
They do something different than we do.	Ha na-eme ihe dị iche karịa ka anyị na-eme.
Not any old ball, of course.	Ọ bụghị bọọlụ ochie ọ bụla, n'ezie.
It is the work of two men.	Ọ bụ ọrụ mmadụ abụọ.
She is obviously happy.	O doro anya na ọ nwere obi ụtọ.
The price is reasonable.	Ọnụ ego ahụ nwere ezi uche.
I have no money.	Enweghị m ego.
He had no choice but to do so.	O nweghị ihe ọzọ ọ ga-eme, ọ bụghị n'ezie.
The weather it works or not.	Ihu igwe ọ na-arụ ọrụ ma ọ bụ na ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
At the same time, her parents gave her a car.	N'otu oge ahụ, nne na nna ya nyere ya ụgbọ ala.
On his way to the hospital.	Ka ọ na-aga ụlọ ọgwụ.
This is her son.	Nke a bụ nwa ya nwoke.
I know he knows.	Ama m na ọ ma.
Everyone was talking.	Onye ọ bụla nọ na-ekwu okwu.
It needs to be told.	Ekwesịrị ịgwa ya.
He knows we don’t have that.	Ọ maara na anyị enweghị nke ahụ.
It was a happy time.	Ọ bụ oge obi ụtọ.
No one should be like that.	Ọ dịghị onye kwesịrị ịdị otú ahụ.
Last year was behind me.	Afọ gara aga bụ n'azụ m.
That alone is not an easy task.	Naanị nke ahụ abụghị ọrụ dị mfe.
This is one of the last.	Nke a bụ otu n'ime ndị ikpeazụ.
They are just as happy as we are.	Ha na-enwe obi ụtọ dị ka anyị na-enwe.
You can get new ideas about life.	Ị nwere ike nweta echiche ọhụrụ gbasara ndụ.
He does not know who he is.	Ọ maghị onye ọ bụ.
The legs are now.	Ụkwụ dị ugbu a.
Most of them are male.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha bụ nwoke.
So it seems that they are both doing the same thing.	Ya mere, ọ dị ka ha abụọ na-eme otu ihe ahụ.
One really likes to eat beans.	Mmadụ na-enwe mmasị n'ezie iri agwa.
It will not work if that is the case.	Ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ ma ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ.
There is nothing better to do.	Ọ dịghị ihe ka mma ime.
So he had a serious problem facing him.	Ya mere o nwere nsogbu siri ike chere ya ihu.
Or at least give him the best chance.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ nye ya ohere kacha mma.
We don't see anything.	Anyị anaghị ahụ ihe ọ bụla.
It is difficult to find whether you will need it.	O siri ike ịchọta ma ị ga-achọ ya.
There are so many things.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe.
Those years seem to be going fast.	Afọ ndị ahụ yiri ka ọ na-aga ngwa ngwa.
My mother loved it.	Nne m hụrụ ya n'anya.
You will have both.	Ị ga-enwe ha abụọ.
The effect is only on the skin.	Mmetụta dị naanị akpụkpọ anụ.
That alone is real.	Naanị ya bụ ezigbo.
He looked at his watch again.	Ọ lere elekere ya ọzọ.
And everyone, of course.	Na onye ọ bụla, n'ezie.
We do not know why.	Anyị amaghị ihe kpatara ya.
So this went on.	Ya mere nke a gara n'ihu.
The functionality of the work is perfect.	Ọrụ nke ọrụ ahụ zuru oke.
I thought it was nothing more.	M chere na o nweghị ihe ọzọ.
I have a similar company do this for me.	Enwere m otu ụlọ ọrụ dị otú ahụ mee m ihe a.
For his part, was very famous.	N'ihi na ya ikwu ya, bụ nnọọ ama.
One book per year, one book per month, nothing.	Otu akwụkwọ kwa afọ, otu akwụkwọ kwa ọnwa, ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla.
It can happen to anyone.	O nwere ike ime onye ọ bụla.
He has thought about it in the past.	Ọ na-eche banyere ya n'oge gara aga.
It is impossible that he is ready for it.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume na ọ dị njikere maka ya.
You want to be active.	Ị chọrọ ịdị na-eme ihe.
We need their help.	Enyemaka anyị chọrọ ha.
But it is a good idea.	Mana ọ bụ echiche dị mma.
It should be you.	O kwesịrị ịbụ gị.
He left early the next morning.	Ọ hapụrụ n'isi ụtụtụ echi ya.
Not people like.	Ọ bụghị ndị dị ka .
This is very stupid.	Nke a bụ nnọọ nzuzu.
There is nothing there.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla n'ebe ahụ.
He knows her well.	Ọ maara ya nke ọma.
I spoke to many of them.	Agwara m ọtụtụ n'ime ha okwu.
It still needs less land.	Ọ ka chọrọ obere ala.
He says that the mind is more important than the body.	Ọ na-ekwu na uche dị nnọọ mkpa karịa anụ ahụ.
There is a lot of wood.	Nwere oke ụzọ osisi.
They can burn or ignite from anything.	Ha nwere ike ime ọkụ ma ọ bụ ọkụ site na ihe ọ bụla.
The dog was there, next to the car.	Nkịta nọ ebe ahụ, n'akụkụ ụgbọ ala.
I am ready to be friends.	Adị m njikere ịbụ enyi.
He is not truthful or saying he would do it.	O nweghị eziokwu ma ọ bụ na-ekwu na ọ ga-eme ya.
I will not go to court or anything.	Agaghị m aga ikpe ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
Help me with this.	Nyere m aka na nke a.
He looked at her quickly.	O lere ya anya ngwa ngwa.
It can be anything.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọ bụla.
All members.	Ndị otu niile.
Perfect for our situation.	Zuru oke maka ọnọdụ anyị.
That is what real patients are.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ezigbo ndị ọrịa dị.
I think you are someone else.	Echere m na ị bụ onye ọzọ.
They both like it here.	Ha abụọ masịrị ya ebe a.
His own country.	Ala nke ya.
Ya na i.	Ya na i.
Not for everyone.	Ọ bụghị maka onye ọ bụla.
But this is not the only one.	Mana nke a abụghị naanị ya.
I do not know what he expects.	Amaghị m ihe ọ tụrụ anya ya.
There is no need to doubt.	Ọ dịghị mkpa inwe obi abụọ.
The tower is far away.	Ụlọ elu ahụ nọ n'ebe dị anya.
Come to one job or several.	Bịa n'otu ọrụ ma ọ bụ ọtụtụ.
Tree heat is the main source of heat.	Okpomọkụ osisi bụ isi okpomọkụ.
It should not take long.	O kwesịghị iwe ogologo oge.
But their own eyes he saw before, and after.	Ma anya onwe ha ọ hụrụ n'ihu, na mgbe.
I like them.	Enwere m mmasị na ha.
This type of monkey is the ancestor of man	Ụdị enwe a bụ nna nna mmadụ

What is happening here.	Ihe na-eme ebe a.
I hope so.	Enwere m olileanya otú ahụ.
These are historical buildings.	Ndị a bụ ụlọ akụkọ ihe mere eme.
We think we know what is best for someone else.	Anyị chere na anyị maara ihe kacha mma maka onye ọzọ.
He feels that you are alone.	Ọ na-eche na ị nọ naanị gị.
You can't do the movie.	Ị gaghị eme ihe nkiri ahụ.
That will not work.	Nke ahụ agaghị arụ ọrụ.
The house is beautiful.	Ụlọ ahụ mara mma.
If he has to run.	Ọ bụrụ na o kwesịrị ịgba ọsọ.
Perfect place.	Ebe zuru oke.
They asked me.	Ha jụrụ m.
My friends will not talk to me.	Ndị enyi m agaghị agwa m okwu.
So it is with their new behavior.	Otú ahụ ka omume ha dị ọhụrụ dị.
I have nothing to do with him.	Ọ dịghị ihe m na-eme ka mụ na ya nọrọ.
Just a friend question.	Naanị ajụjụ enyi.
You got the money.	Ị nwetara ego.
He told his countrymen to know this.	Ọ gwara ndị obodo ya ka ha mara nke a.
But it is beautiful.	Mana ọ mara mma.
I have a cousin who lives there.	Enwere m nwa nwanne nna bi ebe ahụ.
We want them and they want us.	Anyị chọrọ ha na ha chọrọ anyị.
His problem seems very mental.	Nsogbu ya yiri nke ukwuu nke uche.
he was surprised.	o juru ya anya.
This weekend is different.	Izu ụka a bụ ihe dị iche.
All of this is due to our family problems.	Ihe a niile bụ maka nsogbu ezinụlọ anyị.
He cannot see it with his own eyes.	Ọ nweghị ike iji anya nke uche gị hụ ya.
Of course, we as responsible ones can do something about it.	N'ezie, anyị, dị ka ndị nwere ibu ọrụ, pụrụ ime ihe banyere nke a.
We like to go out and run.	Ọ na-amasị anyị ịpụ na-agba ọsọ.

It is very large.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ibu.
You can not be mine.	Ị nweghị ike ịbụ nke m.
No, that is difficult.	Mba, nke ahụ siri ike.
His teammates suddenly stared at him.	Ndị otu ya lere ya anya na mberede.
We do not want to say it twice though.	Anyị achọghị ikwu ugboro abụọ n'agbanyeghị.
The best game food.	Nri egwuregwu kacha mma.
He looks at us.	O lere anyị anya.
I will not be able to do it, man.	Agaghị m enwe ike ime ya, nwoke.
For one thing.	Maka otu ihe.
He ate lunch in the afternoon.	O riri nri ehihie n'ehihie.
This example can help.	Ihe atụ a nwere ike inye aka.
The rules are clear.	Iwu ndị ahụ doro anya.
She wondered how she would feel today.	Ọ nọ na-eche otú ọ ga-adị ya taa.
Thank you for using our service.	Daalụ maka iji ọrụ anyị.
I will still be healthy.	Ahụ ka ga-adị m mma.
They do, without being.	Ha na-eme, na-enweghị ịbụ.
I fell in love with it.	Ahụrụ m ọkụ ọkụ n'anya.
He was given absolute authority.	E nyere ya ikike zuru oke.
No one knows.	Ọ dịghị onye maara ya.
It was easy to make lunch, she says.	Ọ dị mfe ime nri ehihie, ọ na-ekwu.
I was alone.	Adị m naanị.
I see it clearly in this.	Ahụrụ m ya nke ọma na nke a.
The truth, as it were, is the same.	Eziokwu, dị ka ọ dị, bụ otu.
But he won't see you today.	Ma ọ gaghị ahụ gị taa.
But there is still room for more.	Ma a ka nwere ohere maka ihe ole na ole ọzọ.
Our name is important.	Aha anyị dị mkpa.
He would have loved your story.	Ọ gaara amasị akụkọ gị n'anya.
He looked at her quickly from the side.	O lere ya anya ngwa ngwa n'akụkụ.
He was at a nightclub.	Ọ nọ n'ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ abalị.
Whenever he drank water.	Mgbe ọ bụla ọ na-aṅụ mmiri.
He told her all the truth.	Ọ gwara ya eziokwu niile.
The new season is month to month.	Oge ọhụrụ bụ ọnwa ruo ọnwa.
He has no money.	O nweghị ego.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
The idea is not true.	Echiche abụghị eziokwu.
I hope you like it.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ masịrị gị.
I have a special feeling.	Enwere m mmetụta pụrụ iche.
Nothing is planned.	Ọ dịghị ihe na-eme atụmatụ.

However, that is not what you do.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị ihe ị na-eme.
You can see it in front of him.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ya n'ihu ya.
I will continue tomorrow.	M na-aga n'ihu echi.
We don’t have the time we want.	Anyị enweghị oge anyị chọrọ.
But we still know little about him.	Ma anyị ka maara ntakịrị ihe banyere ya.
He traveled to many different places.	Ọ gara ọtụtụ ebe dị iche iche.
I thought about it for a long time.	Echere m ya ruo ogologo oge.
I just saw nothing.	Ọ bụ naanị m hụrụ ihe ọ bụla.

All in a short time, too.	Ha niile n'ime obere oge, kwa.
I don't like cooking.	Isi nri m anaghị amasị ya.
I know him well.	M maara ya nke ọma.
However, that is clearly not the case.	Otú ọ dị, o doro anya na ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
See how long you will be staying.	Hụ ogologo oge ị ga-anọ.
Most people do not know what they are doing.	Ọtụtụ ndị amaghị ihe ha na-eme.
He will come to his house.	Ọ ga-abịa n'ụlọ ya.
Then we don’t work.	Mgbe ahụ, anyị anaghị arụ ọrụ.
And like it all.	Na amasị ya na ihe niile.
But there has always been this way.	Ma ọ dị mgbe ọ dị otú a.
They can't.	Ha enweghị ike.
No one knows your family and your children better than you do.	Ọ dịghị onye maara ezinụlọ gị na ụmụ gị ka gị.
Not what we said.	Ọ bụghị ihe anyị kwuru.
Some restaurants have lights.	Ụfọdụ ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ nwere ọkụ.
But there is a problem like this.	Mana enwere nsogbu dị ka nke a.

But it does not matter.	Ma ọ dịghị mkpa.
That is why we know people.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị ji mara ndị mmadụ.
That would be nice.	Nke ahụ ga-adị mma.
We all love stories.	Anyị niile hụrụ akụkọ n'anya.
In fact, it was in his heart.	N'ezie, ọ dị ya n'obi.
I liked clothes in the past.	Uwe nwere oge gara aga masịrị m.
This problem comes from plant leaves.	Nsogbu a na-abịa site na akwụkwọ osisi.
People are really interested in this.	Ndị mmadụ nwere mmasị n'ezie na nke a.
Just the moment you are.	Naanị oge ị nọ.

Of course there are questions.	N'ezie ajụjụ dị.
It was a foolish, foolish time.	Ọ bụ oge nzuzu, oge nzuzu.

I hope you love it !.	Enwere m olileanya na ị hụrụ ya n'anya!.
It should be.	O kwesịrị ịbụ.
I know that for a fact.	Amaara m nke ahụ n'ezie.
I do not have them.	Anaghị m ha.
But he did not know it.	Ma ọ maghị ya.
For many residents, the message is not there.	Maka ọtụtụ ndị bi na ya, ozi adịghị ebe ahụ.
I want to do this well.	Achọrọ m ime nke a nke ọma.
There are several reasons for this need.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara mkpa a.
Maybe it's a different matter.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ihe dị iche.
I hear them every day.	Ana m anụ ha kwa ụbọchị.
I never expected it to be such a place.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m tụrụ anya na ọ ga-abụ ebe dị otú ahụ.
We do different kinds of tests.	Anyị na-eme ụdị ule dị iche iche.
Seeing is not good.	Ịhụ ihe adịghị mma.
He seems to know a lot about this city.	Ọ dị ka nwoke a maara ọtụtụ ihe banyere obodo a.
She has her perfect mind now.	O nwere uche ya zuru oke ugbu a.
But that's not just men.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị naanị ụmụ nwoke.
This will be my family.	Nke a ga-abụ ezinụlọ m.
He knows the value of this photo.	Ọ maara uru foto a bara.
You say so much.	Ị na-ekwu nke ukwuu.
It will not be allowed.	Ọ gaghị ekwe.
We have a way.	Anyị nwere ụzọ.
He comes from a good family.	O si na ezi ezinụlọ.
What a wonderful example he did not know.	Ụdị ihe atụ dị egwu ọ maghị.
One still understands that the dead are alive.	Otu onye ka ghọtara na ndị nwụrụ anwụ nọ.
He will not be able to.	Ọ gaghị enwe ike.
He knows where my head is.	Ọ ma ebe isi m nọ.
She does not like it.	Ọ naghị adị ya mma.
He tried, really did.	Ọ gbalịrị, mere n'ezie.
Most likely you have a job yourself.	O yikarịrị ka ị nwere ọrụ n'onwe gị.
He has no power to do that.	O nweghị ikike ime nke ahụ.
They stayed there for two years.	Ha nọrọ ebe ahụ afọ abụọ.
It is good to talk to him.	Ọ dị mma ịgwa ya okwu.
It may be more, it may be less.	O nwere ike ịbụ karịa, ọ nwere ike ịdị ntakịrị.
They are used to going to the hospital.	Ịga ụlọ ọgwụ mara ha ahụ́.
For the most part, it is a unique story.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ọ bụ akụkọ pụrụ iche.
This is good.	Nke a dị mma.
How long will you be away?	Ogologo oge ole ka ị ga-aga.
He felt so much more than that.	O nwere mmetụta nke ukwuu karịa mgbe ahụ.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị njọ otú ahụ.
It's pretty good, but you can see it.	Ọ mara ezigbo mma, mana ị nwere ike ịhụ ya.
Now is a serious problem.	Ugbu a bụ nsogbu siri ike.
His wife.	Nwunye ya.
The drink began to help.	Ihe ọṅụṅụ ahụ malitere inye aka.
He wants nothing more than that.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ chọrọ karịa nke ahụ.
She may have been my grandmother.	O nwere ike ịbụ nne nne m mụrụ.
He asked all the questions.	Ọ jụrụ ajụjụ niile.
There is no way to do it now.	O nweghị ụzọ ọ ga-esi mee ya ugbu a.
Many things are the same.	Ọtụtụ ihe bụ otu ihe ahụ.
Any vegetables you have.	Akwụkwọ nri ọ bụla ị nwere.
I think right now, we are playing with our strengths.	Echere m ugbu a, anyị na-egwu egwu na ike anyị.

It is for everyone.	Ọ bụ maka onye ọ bụla.
But doing so is awesome.	Ma ime ya dị egwu.
They arrived immediately.	Ha rutere ozugbo.
Fun can be found everywhere, if you are looking for it.	Enwere ike ịhụ ihe ụtọ n'ebe niile, ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-achọ ya.
You work on it because it is so important.	Ị na-arụ ọrụ na ya n'ihi na ọ dị oke mkpa.
But you know that very well.	Ma ị maara nke ahụ nke ọma.
The people are amazed.	O juru ndị obodo ahụ anya.
This is not the same.	Nke a abụghị otu.
I can't find anything for it.	Ahụghị m ihe ọ bụla maka ya.
But it is a team game.	Mana ọ bụ egwuregwu otu.
But they have the same ideas and the same ideas.	Ma ha nwere otu echiche na otu echiche.
That was about two years ago.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe dị ka afọ abụọ gara aga.
Impossible, we thought.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume, anyị chere.
He got it from his mother.	O nwetara ya n'aka nne ya.
The others look at his clothes.	Ndị ọzọ lere uwe ya anya.
It's the same type.	Ọ bụ otu ụdị.
What is a cloud?	Gịnị bụ igwe ojii?
We went into a beautiful night.	Anyị gara n'ime abalị mara mma.
The company employs four people.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ na-arụ ọrụ mmadụ anọ.
It's near here.	Ọ dị nso ebe a.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
Of course, we know it.	N'ezie, anyị maara ya.
He is not a child.	Ọ bụghị nwata.
So, of course it exists.	Ya mere, n'ezie ọ dị.
But that is where the real good comes from.	Ma ebe ahụ ka ihe ọma na-eme n'ezie.
Which is very reasonable.	Nke bụ nnọọ ezi uche.
Others will feel the effects of lies.	Ndị ọzọ ga-enwe mmetụta nke ụgha.
They are really bad.	Ha bụ ndị ọjọọ n'ezie.
It started a year after the event.	Ọ malitere otu afọ mgbe ihe ahụ mechara.
What makes them different is the need.	Ihe na-eme ka ha dị iche na mkpa.
They are constantly moving forward.	Ha na-aga n'ihu mgbe niile.
He runs, but he does not run.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ, mana ọ naghị agba ọsọ.
This is the hope for me.	Nke a bụ olileanya nye m.
Her clothes are beautiful.	Uwe ya mara mma.
Everyone here knows her.	Onye ọ bụla nọ ebe a maara ya.
It's just a door.	Ọ bụ naanị ọnụ ụzọ.
This will not work.	Nke a agaghị arụ ọrụ.
He laid down his life for me.	O tinyere ndụ ya n’aka m.
He spoke.	O kwuru okwu.
He was obviously angry.	O doro anya na iwe were ya.
You can really do anything.	Ị nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla n'ezie.
He is very unhappy.	Obi adịghị ya ụtọ nke ukwuu.
Breakfast is very basic.	Nri ụtụtụ bụ nnọọ isi.
He told you to do it.	Ọ bụ ya gwara gị mee ya.
I love you so much when you're angry, he said.	Ahụrụ m gị n'anya nke ukwuu mgbe iwe were gị, o kwuru.
But only one minute.	Mana naanị otu nkeji.
There is so much to say.	E nwere ọtụtụ ihe a pụrụ ikwu.
Of course, it makes things easier.	N'ezie, ọ na-eme ka ihe dị mfe.
He died.	Ọ nwụrụ.
Family of each other.	Ezinụlọ nke ibe ya.
It’s as important as the story.	Ọ bụ ihe kacha mkpa dị ka akụkọ.
The land has food.	Ala nwere nri.
The fastest way to be happy ever.	Ụzọ kacha ọsọ na-enwe obi ụtọ mgbe ọ bụla.

Not that he has many of them.	Ọ bụghị na o nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
Many models are good.	Ọtụtụ ụdị dị mma.

They promise a new body.	Ha kwere nkwa na a ga-enwe ahụ ọhụrụ.
His whereabouts are unknown.	Amaghị ebe ọ nọ.

But it is.	Mana ọ bụ ya.
I do not want anything from others.	Achọghị m ihe n'aka ndị ọzọ.

He looked at the clock.	O lere anya na elekere.
You will be happy and not afraid.	Ị ga-enwe obi ụtọ adịghị atụ egwu.

Their leaders have been imprisoned.	A tụrụ ndị isi ha mkpọrọ.
Get us home right away.	Mee ka anyị nọrọ n'ụlọ ozugbo.
They realize that something bad is happening.	Ha ghọtara na ihe ọjọọ na-eme.
You are reading this book.	Ị na-agụ akwụkwọ a.
He did not want to think about that.	Ọ chọghị iche echiche banyere nke ahụ.
That was when his career really began.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka ọrụ ya malitere n'ezie.
We can not.	Anyị enweghị ike.

My grandmother was famous for her cooking.	Nne nne m bụ onye a ma ama maka isi nri ya.

But then, before he knew it, touch.	Ma mgbe ahụ, tupu ọ mara ya, aka.
I will be that.	M ga-abụ nke ahụ.
It's about a bed.	Ọ banyere akwa.
They said something.	Ha kwuru ihe.
That worked out well.	Nke ahụ gara nke ọma.
Life is not about me, it is about others.	Ndụ abụghị banyere m, ọ bụ banyere ndị ọzọ.
The house is beautiful.	Ụlọ ahụ mara mma.
He eventually got his driver's license.	O mechara nweta akwụkwọ ikike ịnya ụgbọ ala ya.
Stay with him here.	Gị na ya nọrọ ebe a.
These shoes are comfortable.	Akpụkpọ ụkwụ ndị a dị mma.
He could not.	O nweghị ike.
Many people love it.	Ọtụtụ ndị hụrụ ya n'anya.
He was rushed to a hospital.	E mere ngwa ngwa gaa ụlọ ọgwụ.
But he is in trouble.	Ma ọ nọ ná nsogbu.

They make everything different.	Ha na-eme ka ihe niile dị iche iche.

Obviously not good.	O doro anya na ọ dịghị mma.
However, the idea is that people can travel with others.	Otú ọ dị, echiche a na-eche na ndị mmadụ nwere ike iso ndị ọzọ mee njem.
She knew the man.	Ọ ma nwoke ahụ.
He was the last person to leave the building.	Ọ bụ ya bụ onye ikpeazụ hapụrụ ụlọ ahụ.
She begins to cry.	Ọ malitere ibe ákwá.
No lies, no games.	Enweghị ụgha, enweghị egwuregwu.
I don't think what he said.	Echeghị m ihe o kwuru.
But it is true.	Ma ọ bụ eziokwu.
It is impossible to be someone else.	Agaghị ekwe omume ibu onye ọzọ.
Tell your friends !.	Gwa ndị enyi gị!.
That is stupid.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe nzuzu.
He said his work was the first.	O kwuru na ọrụ ya bụ nke mbụ.
Like his father.	Dị ka nna ya.
But you are human.	Mana ị bụ mmadụ.
Get well this morning.	Nwee ahụ nke ọma n'ụtụtụ a.
He thought he would come.	O chere na ọ ga-abịa.
This is not the case for the second.	Nke a abụghị ikpe maka nke abụọ.
He put some examples in the room.	O tinyere ihe atụ ụfọdụ n'ime ụlọ.
All of this is just words, just words.	Ihe a niile bụ naanị okwu, naanị okwu.
I do not know why or when.	Amaghị m ihe kpatara ya ma ọ bụ mgbe.
Not the boy she wanted to be.	Ọ bụghị nwa nwoke ọ chọrọ ka ọ bụ.
The mother will be happy.	Nne ga-enwe obi ụtọ.

Rest at home for three weeks.	Zuru ike n'ụlọ izu atọ.

He wanted it, just him.	Ọ chọrọ ya, naanị ya.
However, it was a success.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụ ihe ịga nke ọma.
He is afraid.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya.
My girls are happy.	Ụmụ agbọghọ m nwere obi ụtọ.
They really knew what to do.	Ha maara n'ezie ihe ha ga-eme.
That was my biggest fear.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ụjọ m.
It’s a little more than that.	Ọ dị ntakịrị karịa ya.
They can know when a meeting is difficult.	Ha nwere ike ịma mgbe nzukọ siri ike.
It is a kind of weak temper.	Ọ bụ ụdị iwe ọkụ na-adịghị ike.
What is your opinion?	Kedu ihe bụ echiche gị?

There was a girl and a man.	E nwere otu nwa agbọghọ na otu nwoke.

He left on his own.	Ọ pụrụ n'onwe ya.
Thanks for the information !.	Daalụ maka ozi!.
I don’t think you would be interested.	Echeghị m na ị ga-enwe mmasị.
In its second season.	N'ime oge nke abụọ ya.
Not a good practice.	Ọ bụghị omume dị mma.
We have the best time.	Anyị nwere oge kacha mma.
There is no place for a single party to happen on its own.	O nweghị ebe otu oriri ga-eme onwe ya.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ọ chọghị ịgwa m okwu.
I feel that he understands me.	Enwere m mmetụta na ọ ghọtara m.
As mentioned, work is the main activity of life.	Dị ka e kwuru, ọrụ bụ isi ọrụ ndụ.
But it is very difficult.	Ma ọ siri ezigbo ike.
But he asked the question.	Ma, ọ jụrụ ya ajụjụ ahụ.

Any such feelings.	Mmetụta ọ bụla dị otú ahụ.
These are my friends for my life.	Ndị a bụ ndị enyi m maka ndụ m.

You may not want to be.	O nwere ike ị gaghị achọ ịbụ.

Now, however, he does not care.	Otú ọ dị, ugbu a, ọ chọghị ịma.
I’m excited about it, of course.	Enwere m obi ụtọ maka ya, n'ezie.
I have it with me.	Enwere m ya na m.

Most of you can do it once a month.	Ọtụtụ n'ime unu nwere ike ime otu ugboro n'ọnwa.
He is a great man.	Ọ bụ nnukwu mmadụ.
Hence the fire.	N'ihi ya ọkụ.

I know he wants only the best for you.	Ama m na ọ chọrọ naanị ihe kacha mma maka gị.
This is why.	Nke a bụ ihe mere ya.
He put the thought behind his mind.	O mere ka echiche ahụ n'azụ n'obi ya.
All the time.	Niile na oge.
We are ready to give everything we have.	Anyị dị njikere inye ihe niile anyị nwere.
That is the story they want everyone to know.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ha chọrọ ka mmadụ niile mara.
Night after night he was recommending.	N'abalị n'abalị ọ nọ na-atụ aro.
Things are very different.	Ihe dị nnọọ iche.
Human hell.	Ala mmụọ mmadụ.
He may be well.	O nwere ike ịdị ya nke ọma.
Water is coming and going.	Mmiri na-abịa ma na-aga.
Only coffee would be fine.	Naanị kọfị ga-adị mma.
They read only their own books.	Ha na-agụ naanị akwụkwọ nke ha.
But those days are past.	Ma ụbọchị ndị ahụ bụ n'oge gara aga.

I was thinking about food.	M nọ na-eche banyere nri.
It is loved.	A na-enwe mmasị na ya.
It is just an interview with some people.	Ọ bụ naanị ịgba ụfọdụ ndị ajụjụ ọnụ.
Sometimes this works, but sometimes this doesn’t happen.	Mgbe ụfọdụ nke a na-arụ ọrụ, ma mgbe ụfọdụ nke a anaghị eme.
I miss everything.	A na m atụ uche ihe niile.
I do not know where we are now.	Amaghị m ebe anyị nọ ugbu a.
The actor started acting as a child.	Onye na-eme ihe nkiri malitere ime ihe nkiri mgbe ọ bụ nwata.
It's this, it's a big problem.	Ọ bụ a, ọ bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
That will not be difficult.	Nke ahụ agaghị esi ike ime.
Throwing things out to make a name for yourself.	Ịgba ihe ụfọdụ iji mee onwe ya aha.

Take your time.	Were awa gị.
None of these things seem to exist.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a yiri ka ọ dị adị.
Your family should be treated as such.	Ekwesịrị ka e were ezinụlọ gị dị ka ndị pụrụ iche ha bụ.

The water was clear and cold.	Mmiri ahụ doro anya na oyi.
Otherwise, the two are very different.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ha abụọ dị nnọọ iche.
That's when the idea for the present came.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka echiche maka ugbu a bịara.
He went to the capital.	Ọ gara isi obodo obodo ahụ.
Just going to school.	Naanị ịga akwụkwọ.
This is the last one.	Nke a bụ nke ikpeazụ.
They have none.	Ha enweghị nke ọ bụla.
Believe it or not.	Kwere n'ihe, hụ ya ebe niile.
She was afraid to feel this way.	Ọ tụrụ ya ụjọ inwe mmetụta dị otú a.
Two of the best.	Abụọ nke kacha mma.
Every last one of you.	Onye ọ bụla ikpeazụ n'ime unu.
It’s all about the patient.	Ọ bụ ihe niile gbasara onye ọrịa.
Third view.	Echiche nke atọ.
He really needed two.	Ọ chọrọ abụọ n'ezie.
He was given a small dose of medication.	E nyere ya obere ọgwụ ọgwụ.
In the case of many other nations.	N'ihe banyere ọtụtụ mba ndị ọzọ.
Gifts are useful only for a short time.	Onyinye bara uru naanị obere oge.
But it was my fault.	Mana ọ bụ m kpatara.
Who will be us.	Onye ga-abụ anyị.
In a word, it is high.	N'otu okwu, ọ dị elu.
On the phone, at the same time.	Na ekwentị, n'otu oge ahụ.
He is more busy than we are.	O ji ọrụ n'aka karịa anyị.
I told him of his success.	Agwara m ya ihe ịga nke ọma ya.
Big difference !.	Nnukwu ihe dị iche!.
Liquid soils have a wide variety of species.	Ala mmiri mmiri nwere nnukwu ụdị dị iche iche.
He does not want us to leave here, any of us.	Ọ chọghị ka anyị si ebe a pụọ, onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị.
Then there is nothing.	Mgbe ahụ o nweghị ihe ọ bụla.
That was no accident.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe mberede.
He can never really say, no more.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ pụrụ ikwu n'ezie, ọ bụghị ọzọ.
He spoke well and well.	O kwuru okwu nke ọma na nke ọma.
I was not hungry most of the time.	Agụụ m adịghị mma ọtụtụ oge.
He goes out the back door so that he cannot see us.	Ọ pụrụ n'ọnụ ụzọ azụ ka ọ ghara ịhụ anyị.
The door is on the right.	Ọnụ ụzọ dị n'aka nri.
This is a small problem.	Nke a bụ obere nsogbu.
It is small but difficult.	Ọ dị obere mana o siri ike.
It is not.	Ọ bụghị ya.
As the second happened.	Dị ka nke abụọ mere.
You may want it.	Ị nwere ike ịchọrọ ya.
Life is what you do.	Ndụ bụ ihe ị na-eme ya.

He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
This problem is very serious side by side.	Nsogbu a dị oke njọ n'akụkụ ugboro ugboro.
Their language comes across as beautiful.	Asụsụ ha na-abịa dị ka nke mara mma.

But of course not.	Ma n'ezie ọ bụghị.
Now, it makes sense.	Ugbu a, ọ bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya.

There is something very serious about it.	Ọ dị ihe dị nnọọ njọ banyere ya.
There is a lot of information.	Enwere ọtụtụ ozi.
This book is hard, but it is hard.	Akwụkwọ a siri ike, mana o siri ike.
It seems that everything has its metaphor.	Ọ dị ka ihe ọ bụla nwere ihe atụ ya.

Can anyone please help me with this.	Enwere ike onye ọ bụla biko nyere m aka na nke a.
It can be used on face and body.	Enwere ike iji ya mee ihe na ihu na ahụ.
The anger quickly subsided.	Iwe ahụ kwụsịrị ngwa ngwa.
But people, they do a lot of things.	Ma ndị mmadụ, ha na-eme ọtụtụ ihe.
Our group is different.	Otu anyị dị iche.

This is very bad for him.	Nke a bụ nnọọ ihe ọjọọ nye ya.
Obviously this will not be a working day.	O doro anya na nke a agaghị abụ ụbọchị ọrụ.

Thanks for the beautiful food.	Daalụ maka nri mara mma.
In the past, the important role of the community was played here.	N'oge gara aga, a na-arụ ọrụ dị mkpa nke obodo ebe a.

They continue their journey.	Ha gara n’ihu njem ha.
Certainly not his.	N'ezie ọ bụghị nke ya.
The only thing I want to know is you doing today.	Naanị ihe m chọrọ ịma ka ị na-eme taa.
He asked a simple question.	Ọ jụrụ ajụjụ dị mfe.
Her body feels better here.	Ahụ ya ka mma ebe a.
It was a challenge for him.	Ọ bụ ihe isi ike maka ya.
Not of this age.	Ọ bụghị nke oge a.
But that happened a long time ago.	Ma mere ogologo oge gara aga.
This is his chance.	Nke a bụ ohere ya.
Do things that make you happy.	Mee ihe na-eme gị obi ụtọ.

But he was amazed at the expression on his face.	Ma o juru ya anya ịhụ otú ihu ya si dị.
A woman was sitting in front of her house.	Otu nwanyị nọ ọdụ n'ihu ụlọ ya.
Thank you very much.	Daalụ nke ukwuu.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Ọ dịghị ihe bara uru karịa.

In his message, only one.	Na ozi ya, naanị otu.
It is a gift, he wants to say.	Ọ bụ onyinye, ọ chọrọ ikwu.
That is the idea.	Nke ahụ bụ echiche.
Nothing practical or personal, none of them.	Ọ dịghị ihe bara uru ma ọ bụ nke onwe, ọ dịghị nke ha.
This is not your intention.	Nke a abụghị uche gị.

There are chances that he will need to take legal action.	Enwere ohere ọ ga-adị mkpa ka ọ mee ihe gbasara iwu.
I am not at home.	Anọghị m n'ụlọ.
Just give it a chance.	Naanị nye ya ohere.

You run them running fast.	Ị na-agba ọsọ ha na-agba ọsọ ọsọ.

The second long fire is coming.	Ọkụ nke abụọ dị ogologo na-abịa.

Not a joke, he told himself.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọchị, ọ gwara onwe ya.
It seems to me, just without anyone special.	Ọ dị ka m, naanị na-enweghị onye pụrụ iche.
This is my opportunity.	Nke a bụ ohere m.
He is obviously the head of the company.	O doro anya na ọ bụ onye isi ụlọ ọrụ.
No one looked at him.	Ọ dịghị onye lere ya anya.
They left him.	Ha hapụrụ ya.
Never with a customer, no.	Ọ dịghị mgbe na onye ahịa, mba.
I really like the girls who work there.	Ụmụ agbọghọ ndị na-arụ ọrụ ebe ahụ na-amasị m nke ukwuu.
Or his living, beautiful face.	Ma ọ bụ ihu ya dị ndụ, mara mma.
I am going down.	M na-aga ala.
We have no time to follow.	Anyị enweghị oge iso.
But this morning.	Mana ụtụtụ a.
He has two letters.	O ji akwụkwọ ozi abụọ.
There is a small window.	Enwere otu obere windo.
They like sports.	Egwuregwu na-amasị ha.
Just to see that.	Naanị ịhụ nke ahụ.
Their small family makes me happy.	Obere ezinụlọ ha na-eme m obi ụtọ.
He probably refused.	Ọ ga-abụ na ọ jụrụ.
We didn't see any of them here.	Anyị ahụghị nke ọ bụla ebe a.
He was young but smart.	Ọ bụ nwata mana mara ihe.
Anything more than you want!	Ihe ọ bụla karịa ka ịchọrọ!
But we ate on time, our only lunch was now.	Mana anyị na-eri nri n'oge, naanị nri ehihie anyị bụ ugbu a.
Take a break from time to time.	Were ezumike site n'oge ruo n'oge.
Let them be.	Ka ha bụrụ.
I'm not really sure.	Ejighị m n'aka n'ezie.
It's like the second time it happens.	Ọ dị ka nke ugboro abụọ ọ na-eme.
No big problem.	Enweghị nnukwu nsogbu.
No words necessary.	Ọ dịghị okwu dị mkpa.
He doesn't seem to be afraid at all.	Ọ dị ka ọ naghị atụ egwu ihe ọ bụla.
I don’t have a daughter, of course.	Enweghị m nwa nwanyị, n'ezie.
Do this while lighting your home.	Mee nke a mgbe ị na-agba ọkụ n'ụlọ gị.
Probably not this year.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ gaghị eme n'afọ a.
Its taste is neither good nor bad and it does not exist.	Ụtọ ya adịghị mma ma ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ ma ọ dịghị adị.
I think the president has that right.	Echere m na onye isi ala nwere ikike ahụ.
At the top.	Na elu.
It is happening fast.	Ọ na-eme ọsọ ọsọ.
The rules of the game are simple.	Iwu nke egwuregwu dị mfe.
From there, he knew neither he nor his actions.	Site n'ebe ahụ, ọ maara ma ọ maghị omume nke ya.
Those who know us well know that we love height.	Ndị maara anyị nke ọma maara na ọ na-amasị anyị ịdị elu.
It did his job, of course.	O mere ya ọrụ, n'ezie.
I will be his wife.	M ga-abụ nwunye ya.
He may not be a police officer.	O nwere ike ịbụ na ọ bụghị onye uwe ojii.
But once you do, you have a friend in life.	Ma ozugbo i mere ya, i nwere enyi ná ndụ.
Just as he did.	Dị nnọọ ka o mere.
This is you.	Nke a bụ gị.
Good job on this !.	Ọrụ dị mma na nke a!.
I might be upset about this.	Enwere m ike iwe iwe maka nke a.
He does not expect it.	Ọ naghị atụ anya ya.
That is why he has sought it.	Ọ bụ ya mere o ji chọọ ya.
It looks good on it.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị mma na ya.
And he said.	O wee sị.
No, that is a clear lie.	Ọ bụghị, nke ahụ bụ ụgha doro anya.
This is only small, however.	Nke a bụ naanị obere, Otú ọ dị.
One is that this does not matter.	Otu bụ na nke a adịghị mkpa.
The city is famous for its use.	Obodo a ma ama maka ji ya.
We are not talking about just houses.	Ọ bụghị naanị ụlọ ka anyị na-ekwu maka ya.
They are like the others he sees.	Ha dị ka ndị ọzọ ọ hụrụ.
In everything, you came in handy.	N'ihe niile, ị bịara na aka.
Not that week.	Ọ bụghị izu ahụ.
The boy hates them.	Nwa ahụ kpọrọ ha asị.
It is a house that will always be there.	Ọ bụ ụlọ na ọ ga-adị mgbe niile.
You just need to know what is going on.	Naanị mkpa ka ị mara ihe na-eme.
What is this ?.	Gịnị bụ a?.
But that seems impossible.	Mana nke ahụ dị ka ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
No one.	O nweghị onye.
But the main function is cash flow.	Ma isi ọrụ bụ ego ego ego.
And mine is no different.	Na nke m adịghị iche.
How he behaved.	Otú o si mee omume ọma.
So that in itself is very good.	Ya mere na n'onwe ya dị oke mma.
He had the heart to give such.	O nwere obi inye ihe dị otú ahụ.
They continue to love me.	Ha na-aga n'ihu ịhụ m n'anya.
But take action.	Ma mee ihe.
This is still difficult for him.	Nke a ka siri ya ike.
He has it for my boss.	O nwere ya maka onye isi m.
To tell me he loves me.	Iji gwa m na ọ hụrụ m n'anya.
I am not a fool.	Abụghị m onye nzuzu.
And eggs.	Na akwa.
However, it is not easy.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mfe.
There are many good programs to do with that.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe omume dị mma na-eme na nke ahụ.
It is something we can move forward with.	Ọ bụ ihe anyị nwere ike ịga n'ihu.
It also makes water.	Ọ na-eme kwa mmiri.
This is your job.	Nke a bụ ọrụ gị.
It is difficult to eat.	O siri ike iri nri.
You have to do what you have to do.	Ị ga-eme ihe ị ga-eme.
He is still a fool.	Ọ ka bụ onye nzuzu.
I want everyone to see it everywhere.	Achọrọ m ka onye ọ bụla hụ ya n'ebe niile.
The work is not for tomorrow.	Ọrụ ahụ abụghị maka echi.
I need a monthly salary.	Achọrọ m ụgwọ ọnwa kwa elekere.
You did it!	Ọ bụ gị mere ya!
Find this out and know.	Chọọ nke a ma mara.
Maybe he is the man you want.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ nwoke ahụ ị chọrọ.
It can have an effect.	O nwere ike inwe mmetụta.
The mind is very real in thinking about the limits of reality.	Uche dị nnọọ adị na-eche echiche na oke nke eziokwu.
There is no case.	Ọ nweghị ikpe.
Or it will happen in a few days.	Ma ọ bụ ọ ga-eme n'ime ụbọchị ole na ole.
So it did.	Ya mere, o mere.
He is well known, but different.	Ọ maara nke ọma, ma dị iche.
He was wise, but he was obviously in trouble.	Ọ maara ihe, ma o doro anya na ọ nọ ná nsogbu.
He has his own ideas.	O nwere echiche nke ya.
He slapped the boy.	Ọ mara nwata ahụ ụra.
You have no time to think.	Ị nweghị oge iche echiche.
He has his own ideas.	O nwere echiche nke ya.
He has no money.	O nweghị ego.
They will not be happy.	Ha agaghị enwe obi ụtọ.
He took the letter.	O were akwụkwọ ozi ahụ.
I can not tell you what will happen.	Enweghị m ike ịgwa gị ihe ga-eme.
It came suddenly.	Ọ bịara na mberede.
Time to take action.	Oge iji were ọrụ.
I think you need to take it easy.	Echere m na ọ dị mkpa ka ị were ya mfe.
She is free.	O nwere onwe ya.
Otherwise, not too much.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ bụghị nke ukwuu.
The time he wants.	Oge ọ chọrọ.
Alcohol is a different matter.	Mmanya bụ ihe dị iche iche.
To punish us.	Iji taa anyị ahụhụ.
It certainly works well for the company.	O doro anya na ọ na-arụ ọrụ dị mma maka ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
This is obviously without flesh.	Nke a doro anya na enweghị anụ ahụ.
It is an old song.	Ọ bụ abụ ochie.
We should be there within ten minutes.	Anyị kwesịrị ịnọ ebe ahụ n'ime nkeji iri.
The students are very nice.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ahụ mara ezigbo mma.
It’s what you do or don’t do.	Ọ bụ ihe ị na-eme ma ọ bụ na ị naghị eme ya.
Condition does not work.	Ọnọdụ anaghị arụ ọrụ.
You do not have to do everything.	Ọ bụghị iwu na ị ga-eme ihe niile.
They are small.	Ha dị obere.
You see, much remains to be done.	Ị hụrụ, ọtụtụ ihe ka dị.
Everything is very good.	Ihe niile dị oke mma.
This is going to be a big day.	Nke a ga-abụ nnukwu ụbọchị.
I told everyone.	Agwara m onye ọ bụla.
What is close.	Gịnị bụ nso.
He did not know what he was really looking for.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ na-achọ n'ezie.
The city is known for its books.	E ji akwụkwọ ya mara obodo a.
But few people understand this.	Ma mmadụ ole na ole ghọtara nke a.
Easy to get around.	Dị mfe inwe gburugburu.
However, this is not a problem.	Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị nsogbu.
He is not the only man now.	Ọ bụghị naanị nwoke ugbu a.
But more than that, you told him.	Ma nke ka nke ahụ, ị ​​gwara ya.
Everyone around him thought he was a success.	Ndị niile gbara ya gburugburu chere na o nwere ihe ịga nke ọma.
They measured it well.	Ha tụrụ ya nke ọma.
Can you know that ?.	Ị nwere ike ịma nke?.
People are coming.	Ndị mmadụ na-abịa.
Feel strong on your face.	Nwee mmetụta ike na ihu gị.
It will stay here.	Ọ ga-anọ ebe a.
No matter what they may say or think.	N'agbanyeghị ihe ha nwere ike ikwu ma ọ bụ na-eche.
He was my first child, of course.	Ọ bụ nwa mbụ m, n'ezie.
Many homes and apartments were overcrowded.	A gbara ọtụtụ ụlọ na ụlọ ọkụ nke ukwuu.
But that is great if.	Ma nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ma ọ bụrụ.
There are three types here.	Ụdị atọ ebe a.
This space is required back.	Achọrọ ohere a azụ.
Let's do something similar here, he said.	Ka anyị mee ihe yiri nke a ebe a, o kwuru.
All my life.	Ndụ m niile.
What is your favorite food?	Kedu nri kacha amasị gị?
Many say the price is too high.	Ọtụtụ ndị na-ekwu na ọnụ ahịa ahụ dị oke elu.
A lot of thoughts go through my head.	Ọtụtụ echiche na-aga n'isi m.
We make it perfect.	Anyị na-eme ka a ghara inwe ihe zuru oke.
Of course, it is very simple.	N'ezie, ọ dị nnọọ mfe.
He looked at the book and left.	O lere akwụkwọ wee pụọ.
There, he has another way available.	N'ebe ahụ, o nwere ọzọ ụzọ ọ bụla dị.
Is there nothing else you can do?	Ị nweghị ihe ndị ọzọ ị ga-eme?
As it were.	Dị ka ọ dị.
It’s not fun, not by long.	Ọ bụghị ihe na-atọ ụtọ, ọ bụghị site na ogologo oge.
They have many.	Ha nwere ọtụtụ.
I do not care.	Achọghị m ịma.
I do not know how this will work.	Amaghị m ka nke a ga-esi arụ ọrụ.
The most loving, beautiful man.	Nwoke kacha hụ n'anya, mara mma.

That kind of food is not good.	Ụdị nri ahụ adịghị mma.
It's a big threat.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ihe egwu.
Things are still easier in person '.	Ihe ka dị mfe na mmadụ'.
None of this is required.	Ọ dịghị nke a chọrọ.
We came to your aid.	Anyị bịara inyere gị aka.
Individuals can live for up to 20 years.	Ndị mmadụ n'otu n'otu nwere ike ịdị ndụ ihe dị ka afọ iri abụọ.
Good job.	Ezigbo ọrụ.
He said that bad things would happen otherwise.	O kwuru na ihe ọjọọ ga-eme ma ọ́ bụghị ya.
Sit down, sit down.	Nọdụ ala, nọdụ ala.
Not there.	Ọ bụghị ebe ahụ.
If you can help others, do your best.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike inyere ndị ọzọ aka, mee ya ka ị nwere ike.
I don’t think anyone really does.	Echeghị m na onye ọ bụla na-eme n'ezie.
You know it.	Ị maara na ọ bụ ya.
Our eyes met.	Anya anyị zutere.
That is good.	Nke ahụ dị mma.
So that idea went in.	Ya mere echiche dị otú ahụ gara.
Hard ground.	Ala siri ike.
And whatever effect it has on him.	Na mmetụta ọ bụla o nwere n'ebe ọ nọ.
So why did they do it?	Ya mere, gịnị mere ha ji mee ya?
Up several times a night.	Elu ọtụtụ ugboro n'abalị.
I want to feel.	Achọrọ m inwe mmetụta.
But that did not happen.	Ma nke ahụ emeghị ya.
He expected it to be one of the last two.	Ọ tụrụ anya na ọ bụ otu n'ime abụọ ikpeazụ.
Like a joke.	Dị ka ihe ọchị.
There is some kind of sweet spot there.	Enwere ụdị ebe dị ụtọ n'ebe ahụ.
Then you have many more.	Mgbe ahụ ị nwere ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ.
It is not found anywhere.	Ọ bụghị ebe ọ bụla a hụrụ ya.
We value it here.	Anyị ji kpọrọ ihe ebe a.
They have an interesting history.	Ha nwere akụkọ ihe mere eme na-atọ ụtọ.
I still have my first book.	M ka nwere akwụkwọ mbụ m.
Those are just a few of the big games.	Ndị ahụ bụ naanị ole na ole n'ime nnukwu egwuregwu.
Not of any kind.	Ọ bụghị ụdị ọ bụla.
I hope you come soon.	Enwere m olileanya na ị ga-abịa ngwa ngwa.
Not many, but few.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ, mana ole na ole.
According to the idea.	Dị ka echiche.
It feels so great.	Ọ dị ya nnọọ ukwuu.
Everything is fun.	Ihe niile na-atọ ụtọ.
I will do that.	Aga m eme nke ahụ.
When he does, reward him.	Mgbe o mere ya, nye ya ụgwọ ọrụ.
It was the first game the company played.	Ọ bụ egwuregwu mbụ ụlọ ọrụ ahụ mere.
He had no parents.	O nweghị nne ma ọ bụ nna.
Maybe who he is.	Ma eleghị anya, onye ọ bụ.
Because it is true.	N'ihi na ọ bụ eziokwu.
He had a hard life.	O nwere ndụ siri ike.
Maybe you will be fine.	Eleghị anya ị ga-adị mma.
Of course tonight was a tough game.	N'ezie n'abalị a bụ egwuregwu siri ike.
I'm not good at it.	Adịghị m mma na ya.
We did not do it.	Anyị emeghị ya.
We want to make history.	Anyị na-achọ ime akụkọ ihe mere eme.
But there is more.	Ma e nwere ihe ọzọ.
I'm sure.	Eji m n'aka n'ezie.
His grandfather abandoned him.	Nna nna ya hapụrụ ya ya.
Working in a bar.	Na-arụ ọrụ na ụlọ mmanya.
Both cities are very distant.	Obodo abụọ a dị ezigbo anya.
It should not be.	O kwesịghị inwe.
Or any other.	Ma ọ bụ nke ọ bụla ọzọ.
It's easy, he thought.	Ọ dị mfe, o chere.
I do not know anything about myself.	Amaghị m ihe ọ bụla gbasara onwe m.
It is possible that that could happen.	O kwere omume na nke ahụ nwere ike ime.
She would have wanted this baby.	Ọ gaara achọ nwa a.
Current events.	Ihe omume dị ugbu a.
They are just words.	Ha bụ naanị okwu.
I go to school.	M na-aga ụlọ akwụkwọ.
It went well.	Ọ gara nke ọma.
He looked at it carefully.	O lere ya anya nke ọma.
However, he was given little responsibility.	Otú ọ dị, e nyere obere ọrụ.
During the summer months.	N'ime ọnwa okpomọkụ.
Four people died in the accident.	Mmadụ anọ nwụrụ n'ihe mberede a.
He left his gloves behind.	Ọ hapụrụ uwe aka ya n'azụ.
Still said.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ kwuru.
That is his position.	Nke ahụ bụ ọnọdụ ya.
It may be a long day, he said.	O nwere ike ịbụ ogologo ụbọchị, o kwuru.
The other one.	Onye nke ọzọ.
These things are already true.	Ihe ndị a bụ eziokwu ama.
If so, why not?	Ọ bụrụ na ndị ọzọ, gịnị kpatara na ha agaghị eme ya?
The trees are delicious.	Osisi ndị ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
No one is like them.	Ọ dịghị onye bụ onye ha yiri.
He bought a large plot of land.	Ọ zụtara nnukwu ala.
Tell us a little about yourself.	Gwa anyị ntakịrị gbasara onwe gị.
Lots of stuff was put on the floor.	E tinyere ọtụtụ ihe n'akụkụ ala.
This plan is fantastic but possible.	Atụmatụ a dị oke egwu mana enwere ike.
I will be.	m ga-abụ.
There are many more.	E nwere ọtụtụ ihe ndị ọzọ.
She begins to cry.	Ọ malitere ibe ákwá.
There is nothing fancy.	O nweghị ihe mara mma.
He was amazed at how well it worked.	Otú o si arụ ọrụ nke ọma tụrụ ya n’anya.
More than each other.	Karịa ibe ha.
Certainly not my sister.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị nwanne m nwanyị.
You can get real money.	Ị nwere ike nweta ezigbo ego.
I have two sleeves.	Enwere m aka uwe abụọ.
He said quickly.	O kwuru ngwa ngwa.
But it is very cold.	Mana ọ dị ezigbo oyi.
Not so much anymore.	Ọ bụghị nke ukwuu ọzọ.
Good word.	Okwu dị mma.
Which I pretty much.	Nke m mara mma nke ukwuu.
Everyone wants money!	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ ego!
It's a black car.	Ọ bụ ụgbọ ala ojii.
I love this house.	Ahụrụ m ụlọ a n'anya.
That is the main difference.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe dị iche.
That may or may not be a game.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ma ọ bụ na ọ gaghị abụ egwuregwu.
Way back then.	Ụzọ azụ mgbe.
He has more time than now.	O nwere oge ohere karịa ugbu a.
This is what you want to be.	Nke a bụ ihe ị chọrọ ịbụ.
Or maybe one of his children would have run away.	Ma ọ bụ ma eleghị anya, otu n'ime ụmụ ya gaara agba ọsọ.
Not mine, not always.	Ọ bụghị nke m, ọ bụghị mgbe ọ bụla.
My wife has other plans.	Nwunye m nwere atụmatụ ndị ọzọ.
I do not want both.	Achọghị m ha abụọ.
I want too.	Achọrọ m oke.
All they want is for them to be given something to do.	Naanị ihe ha chọrọ bụ ka e nye ha ihe ha ga-eme.
No doubt some actors do it.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na ụfọdụ ndị na-eme ihe nkiri na-eme ya.
It works well.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Vegetables are essential for a healthy diet.	Akwụkwọ nri dị mkpa maka nri dị mma.
Fast forward.	Ngwa ngwa ngwa.
You made me a lot of money.	I mere m ezigbo ego.
For a long time.	Ogologo oge.
I'm glad the sea is clear.	Obi dị m ụtọ na oke osimiri doro anya.
The third is in the back.	Nke atọ nọ n'azụ.
Everything went well at first.	Ihe niile gara nke ọma na mbụ.
All games are just one afternoon.	Egwuregwu niile bụ naanị otu ehihie.
Everything you need.	Ihe niile ị chọrọ.
Really long.	N'ezie ogologo oge.
But unfortunately it only works the first time.	Mana ọ dị nwute na ọ na-arụ ọrụ naanị oge mbụ.
But that is not what you want.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị ihe ị chọrọ.
Certainly not one of us.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị otu n'ime anyị.
He saw flames on the side.	Ọ hụrụ ọkụ n'akụkụ ahụ.
After the meeting, he went to his home.	Mgbe nzukọ ahụ mechara, ọ gara n'ụlọ ya.
The question is not that simple.	Ajụjụ ahụ adịghị mfe otú ahụ.
I still enjoy doing it.	Ọ ka na-atọ m ụtọ ime ya.
I feel good.	Ahụ dị m mma.
You have fun today.	Ị na-atọ ọchị taa.
If so, do it.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ mee, mee.

I have a strong feeling about it.	Enwere m mmetụta siri ike banyere ya.
They have one child together.	Ha nwere otu nwa ọnụ.
Thanks, dear friend.	Daalụ, ezigbo enyi.
The airport is ten minutes away.	Ọdụ ụgbọ elu dị nkeji iri.

Because some people expect a lot.	N'ihi na ụfọdụ ndị na-atụ anya nke ukwuu.
Obviously not.	O doro anya na ị chọghị.
It is beautiful and runs well.	Ọ mara mma ma na-agba ọsọ nke ọma.
I do not know what the problem is.	Amaghị m ihe bụ nsogbu.
I do not know when that time will come.	Amaghị m mgbe oge ahụ ga-abịa.

That is the most important.	Nke ahụ kacha mkpa.
Which is his authority.	Nke bụ ikike ya.
We can do many things.	Anyị nwere ike ime ọtụtụ ihe.
A similar situation occurs with the head.	Ọnọdụ yiri ya na-eme n'isi.
He asked if my mother was healthy.	Ọ jụrụ ma ahụ́ ike nne m.
There is only one police officer.	Enwere naanị otu onye uwe ojii.
Cannot be seen immediately.	Apụghị ịhụ ya ozugbo.
It was so beautiful tonight.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu n'abalị a.
He wants to get out and do something.	Ọ chọrọ ịpụ mee ihe.
If everyone heard what to do.	Ọ bụrụ na onye ọ bụla nụrụ ihe ọ ga-eme.
The newspapers said no.	Akwụkwọ akụkọ ndị ahụ kwuru mba.
We are where we are.	Anyị nọ ebe anyị nwere.
He says.	Ọ na-ekwu.
I think that makes sense !.	Echere m na nke ahụ nwere ezi uche!.
It's not like that.	Ọ dịghị ka ya.
Then on the lower back.	Mgbe ahụ na ala azụ.
All he wants to do is do it today.	Naanị ihe ọ chọrọ bụ ime taa.
For other patients, this effect was not seen.	Maka ndị ọrịa ndị ọzọ, ahụghị mmetụta a.
Looking for more?	Ị na-achọ ihe ọzọ?
Just name a few.	Naanị ịkpọ aha ole na ole.
The police will not like that.	Ndị uwe ojii agaghị amasị nke ahụ.
It can do different things.	Ọ nwere ike ime ihe dị iche iche.
To give us a story.	Iji nye anyị akụkọ.
Empowerment is a new national disease.	Ikike bụ ọrịa mba ọhụrụ.

This year should be different.	Afọ a kwesịrị ịdị iche.
Any word, of course.	Okwu ọ bụla, n'ezie.
He was clear.	O doro ya anya.
Evil in its good is.	Ihe ọjọọ n'ụzọ dị mma ya bụ.
Or at least they knew each other.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, ha maara nke ọ bụla ọzọ.
And each interview is unique in its own way.	Na ajụjụ ọnụ nke ọ bụla pụrụ iche na nke ya.
Possibly great, but few opportunities.	Enwere ike dị ukwuu, mana ohere ole na ole.
He’s a great actor.	Ọ bụ nnukwu onye na-eme ihe nkiri.

Lots of people were there for me.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ nọ ebe ahụ maka m.
This time is no different.	Oge a adịghị iche.
Water makes a person water.	Mmiri na-eme mmadụ mmiri.
The villagers clashed with the city officials.	Ndị obodo ahụ na ndị isi obodo ahụ ọgụ.
They have it all.	Ha nwere ọtụtụ ya.

Which, by the way, has.	Nke, n'ụzọ, o nwere.
It is their job, not my job.	Ọ bụ ọrụ ha, ọ bụghị ọrụ m.

Because we don't have enough money.	Maka na anyị enweghị ego zuru oke.
They arrived at the bar.	Ha rutere n'ụlọ mmanya.
Of course, their thinking can be dangerous.	N'ezie, echiche ha nwere ike ịdị njọ.

I just want to talk to you.	Naanị m chọrọ ịgwa gị okwu.
I don't want anyone's mother.	Achọghị m nne onye ọ bụla.
Take my word for it, it will not be any problem.	Were okwu m maka ya, ọ gaghị enwe nsogbu ọ bụla.
Wondering what they might call it again.	Na-eche ihe ha nwere ike ịkpọ ya ọzọ.
I enjoyed the breakfast.	Nri ụtụtụ ahụ dị m mma.
This, unfortunately, is the best photo available.	Nke a, ọ dị nwute, bụ foto kacha mma dị.
Some old books, some very new.	Ụfọdụ akwụkwọ ochie, ụfọdụ dị nnọọ ọhụrụ.
The impact of the event was better than expected.	Mmetụta nke ihe ahụ dị mma karịa ka a tụrụ anya ya.
He was definitely the best man.	Ọ bụ n'ezie nwoke kacha mma.
And there are many things that can happen.	Na e nwere ọtụtụ ihe nwere ike ime.
That’s all behind me right now.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe niile n'azụ m ugbu a.
You think back on it.	Ị na-eche azụ na ya.
This is the best opportunity to do so.	Nke a bụ ohere kacha mma ime otú ahụ.
He did not need a language.	O nweghị asụsụ ọ chọrọ.
We have no home, no place.	Anyị enweghị ụlọ, enweghị ebe.
They both think the other has something they want.	Ha abụọ chere na nke ọzọ nwere ihe ha chọrọ.
Let him know how he feels.	Mee ka ọ mara otú obi dị ya.
There is no one to help you.	Ọ dịghị onye ga-enyere gị aka.
No doubt he loved her.	O doro anya na ọ hụrụ ya n'anya.
Undoubtedly, these are difficult questions.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya, ndị a bụ ajụjụ siri ike.
Money ahead.	Ego n'ihu.
The woman immediately called me and told me this.	Nwanyị ahụ kpọrọ m ozugbo gwa m ihe a.
With tears in his eyes, he told me to go ahead.	O ji anya mmiri dị n'anya were sị m gaa n'ihu.
He made her stop the car.	O mere ka ọ kwụsị ụgbọ ala ahụ.
Or anyone.	Ma ọ bụ onye ọ bụla.
In his heart, he was her man.	N'obi ya, ọ bụ nwoke ya.
It can't be done.	Enweghị ike ime ya.
He bought her a book.	Ọ zụtara ya akwụkwọ.
He scared the dog.	Ọ tụrụ nkịta ahụ egwu.
The power of giving is stronger than anything else.	Ike nke inye ihe dị ike karịa ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
The same thing can be done with two others.	Enwere ike ime otu ihe ahụ na abụọ ndị ọzọ.
This can’t be a big deal.	Nke a enweghị ike ịbụ nnukwu ihe.
What more do you want.	Kedu ihe ọzọ ị na-achọ.
He gave her a drink.	O nyere ya ihe ọṅụṅụ.
We should call the police.	Anyị kwesịrị ịkpọ ndị uwe ojii.
Here people come from all over the world.	Ebe a ndị mmadụ si mba dị iche iche na-abịa njem.
He could not go upstairs.	O nweghị ike ịga n'ụlọ elu.
He is 30 minutes behind him.	Ọ dị nkeji iri atọ n'azụ ya.
Or so it is with him.	Ma ọ bụ otú ahụ ka ọ dị ya.
Another example of what I am trying to do is.	Ihe atụ ọzọ nke ihe m na-agbalị ime bụ.
He was a good man at heart.	Ọ bụ nwoke nwere ezi uche.
Others have done the same.	Otú ahụ ka ndị ọzọ mere.
Just be sensible.	Naanị nwee uche.
These rivers do not freeze in winter.	Osimiri ndị a anaghị agba oyi n'oge oyi.
I hope they did something about it.	Enwere m olileanya na ha mere ihe banyere ya.
This is not what we want.	Nke a abụghị ihe anyị chọrọ.
He seems weak now.	Ọ dị ka onye adịghị ike ugbu a.
Be a woman.	Bụrụ nwanyị.
It is not fast.	Ọ naghị adị ngwa ngwa.
And of course, they are great.	Na n'ezie, ha dị oke.
When they want to eat breakfast.	Mgbe ha chọrọ iri nri ụtụtụ.
Please everyone there help me to do this.	Biko onye ọ bụla nọ ebe ahụ nyere m aka ime nke a.
Tears came immediately.	Anya mmiri bịara ozugbo.
Many others are.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ bụ.
So he ate another breakfast.	Ya mere, o rie nri ụtụtụ ọzọ.
They are perfect.	Ha zuru oke.
I want to do it more.	Achọrọ m ime ya karịa.
This is true for sports.	Nke a bụ eziokwu maka egwuregwu.
We have so many things to look forward to.	O nwere ọtụtụ ihe anyị na-atụ uche.
So at least no.	Ya mere kacha nta mba.
She looked at her dress.	O lere akwa ya anya.
Well, really good.	Ọ dị mma, ezigbo mma.
He does not know how to proceed.	Ọ gaghị ama ka ọ ga-esi gaa n'ihu.
But then it was this question of photography.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ bụ ajụjụ a nke foto.
His teammates continued.	Ndị ibe ya gara n’ihu.
I do not know what it is.	Amaghị m ihe ọ bụ.
Hatred is not new.	Ịkpọ asị abụghị ihe ọhụrụ.
I have no idea.	Enweghị m echiche ọ bụla.
This is, if anything, good news.	Nke a bụ, ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla, ozi ọma.
He was young and capable at all times.	Ọ bụ nwata ma nwee ike mgbe ọ bụla.
Everything is good.	Ihe niile bụ ezigbo ihe.
She told her husband.	O kwuru ya n’ihu di ya.
I will use what he says now.	M ga-eji ihe ọ na-ekwu na-eme ugbu a.
That type doesn’t need to be perfect.	Ụdị ahụ adịghị mkpa ka ọ bụrụ nke zuru oke.
Make your character beautiful.	Mee ka isi agwa gị mara mma.
So he is stupid.	Ya mere, ọ dị nzuzu.
We will do something, he said.	Anyị ga-eme ihe, o kwuru.
It's fun.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
It's pretty much it, like all the others.	Ọ mara m mma nke ukwuu, dị ka ndị ọzọ niile.
He did the test four times.	O mere ule ahụ ugboro anọ.
Worksheet will be used for homework.	A ga-eji akwụkwọ ọrụ maka ọrụ ụlọ.
I can’t do that kind of thing, really.	Enweghị m ike ime ụdị ihe ahụ, n'ezie.
Not always true.	Ọ bụghị mgbe eziokwu.
I think it will be difficult.	Echere m na ọ ga-esi ike.
They are very small.	Ha dị nnọọ obere.
That is what it really is.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe a bụ n'ezie.
I try to stay healthy.	M na-agbalị ime ka ahụ́ dị m mma.
They are working on it now.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ na ya ugbu a.
Another beautiful angel awaits us all.	Mmụọ ozi ọzọ mara mma na-eche anyị niile.
On the other hand, the policeman on hand.	N'aka nke ọzọ, onye uwe ojii na aka.
But now he was.	Ma ugbu a, ọ nọ.
So he was asked the question.	Ya mere, a jụrụ ya ajụjụ ahụ.
You need to get a chance.	Ị kwesịrị ị nweta ohere.
Then each.	Mgbe ahụ ọ bụla.
We are the ones we care about.	Anyị bụ ndị anyị na-eche.
Everything happens so fast.	Ihe niile na-eme ngwa ngwa.
His wife did not love children.	Nwunye ya ahụghị ụmụaka n'anya.
It seems simple.	O yiri ka ọ dị mfe.
He was amazed at her courage.	Obi ike ya tụrụ ya n’anya.
He never said that life would be easy.	Ọ dịghị mgbe o kwuru na ndụ a ga-adị mfe.
All girls are free with others.	Ụmụ agbọghọ niile nwere onwe ha na ndị ọzọ.
Each situation is different.	Ọnọdụ ọ bụla dị iche.
Everything can happen at that time.	Ihe niile nwere ike ime n'oge ahụ.
Only one man died.	Naanị otu nwoke nwụrụ.
The company could not get the first profit.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ enweghị ike ị nweta uru mbụ.
It seems like a long time.	O yiri ogologo oge.
This fight is just about money.	Ọgụ a bụ naanị ego.
There are many national groups.	Enwere ọtụtụ otu mba.
Too scary to say anything.	Na oke egwu ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
You can make a challenge.	Ị nwere ike ime ihe ịma aka.
He saw far more than anyone else.	Ọ hụrụ nnọọ ihe karịa ndị ọzọ.
That is not just us.	Nke ahụ abụghị naanị anyị.
I want to be with you here.	Achọrọ m ka gị na gị nọrọ ebe a.
Maybe next time!.	Enwere ike oge ọzọ!.
He did most of it.	O mere ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
I do not see it that way.	Ahụghị m ya otú ahụ.
I knew they were there.	Ama m na ha nọ ebe ahụ.
Some people have more than one event.	Ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ nwere ihe karịrị otu ihe omume.
Some people hated the idea.	Ụfọdụ ndị bi ebe ahụ kpọrọ echiche ahụ asị.
It is perfect.	O zuru oke.
So it is time to face reality.	Ya mere ọ bụ oge ihu eziokwu ihu.
Like you as a friend.	Dị ka gị dị ka enyi.
They met for lunch.	Ha zutere maka nri ehihie.
Just the same thing.	Naanị otu ihe ahụ .
At our most important moment.	N'oge anyị kacha mkpa ya.
It can be so much.	O nwere ike ịbụ nke ukwuu.
What kind of dog is that?	Kedu ụdị nkịta nke ahụ bụ?
However, they still need to be quick.	Otú ọ dị, ha ka kwesịrị ịdị ngwa.
Which is useful.	Nke bara uru.
I love it so much.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
That is not our law.	Nke ahụ abụghị iwu anyị.
And every time a runner does something different.	Na oge ọ bụla onye na-agba ọsọ na-eme ihe dị iche iche.
If they do not agree, go somewhere else.	Ọ bụrụ na ha agaghị ekwe gị, gaa ebe ọzọ.
I am not in this for money.	Anọghị m na nke a maka ego.
It's that simple.	Ọ bụ ihe dị mfe.
There are more games going on here.	Enwere egwuregwu ka ukwuu na-eme ebe a.
Here is what to do.	Nke a bụ ihe ị ga-eme.
Some heads, some not so big.	Ụfọdụ ndị isi, ụfọdụ abụghị nnukwu.
You made me go.	Ị mere ka m gaa.
No one knows when it started.	Ọ dịghị onye maara mgbe ọ malitere.
My son, those are sure to have a good time.	Nwa m nwoke, ndị ahụ ji n'aka na oge dị mma.
He knows the face very well.	Ọ maara ihu ahụ nke ọma.
For now.	Maka ugbu a.
The latter did.	Nke ikpeazụ mere ya.
We did it all this morning.	Anyị mere ya niile n'ụtụtụ a.
You are doing well.	Ị na-eme nke ọma.
Money.	Ego.
He called it a lie.	Ọ kpọrọ aha ụgha.
Not in words.	Ọ bụghị na okwu.
This is before doing that.	Nke a bụ tupu ime nke ahụ.
I will not see him.	Agaghị m ahụ ya.
But it went a long way.	Mana ọ gara nke ukwuu.
Rural residents are terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ ndị bi n’ime ime obodo.
We shot it well.	Anyị gbara ya nke ọma.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
Of course we wait.	N'ezie anyị na-eche.
His house is next to a fancy shop.	Ụlọ ya dị n'akụkụ ụlọ ahịa na-atọ ụtọ.
i need to know more than running.	m kwesịrị ịma karịa ịgba ọsọ.
Otherwise, you never know what might be.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ị gaghị ama ihe nwere ike ịbụ.
That is not what we thought.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe anyị chere.
I am happy with that.	Obi dị m ụtọ na nke ahụ.
That would be impossible.	Nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume.
It makes you feel more like a family than any other customer.	Ọ na-eme ka ọ dị gị ka ezinụlọ karịa onye ahịa ọzọ.
Price information in the building the next night.	Ọnụ ego ozi dị na ụlọ ahụ n'abalị ọzọ.
There are several possible reasons for this.	Enwere ike iche ọtụtụ isi ihe kpatara nke a.
He went out from you.	O si n'ebe i nọ pụọ.
You told me.	Ị gwara m.
He knows what he is now.	Ọ maara ihe ọ bụ ugbu a.
He wants to get out.	Ọ na-achọ ịpụ.
Then there are children's problems.	Mgbe ahụ enwere nsogbu ụmụaka.
He looked at me.	O lere m anya.
But you know, deep down, it doesn’t matter.	Ma ị maara, n'ime ala, ọ dịghị mkpa.
There are a few interesting reasons for that.	Enwere ihe ole na ole na-atọ ụtọ kpatara nke ahụ.
These workers have been working for more than a month.	Ndị ọrụ a na-arụ ọrụ kemgbe ihe karịrị otu ọnwa.
You know, you are really beautiful.	Ị mara, ị mara mma n'ezie.
My best friend.	Ezigbo enyi m.
They can't eat in one lunch restaurant.	Ha enweghị ike iri nri n'otu ụlọ nri nri ehihie.
He is her son.	Ọ bụ nwa ya.
Just a little something.	Naanị obere ihe.
Love the person you know.	Hụ onye ị maara n'anya.
There is no point in being angry.	O nweghị isi iwe iwe.
Thanks for the same.	Daalụ otu ihe ahụ.
I hope you are well.	Enwere m olileanya na ị dị mma.
That is not their case.	Ọ bụghị ikpe ha.
But it is very beautiful.	Ma ọ mara ezigbo mma.
I was very surprised.	O juru m anya nke ukwuu.
These are not small boys.	Ndị a abụghị obere ụmụ nwoke.
This is not the case here.	Nke a abụghị ikpe ebe a.
Three beautiful children.	Ụmụ atọ mara mma.
This is not a test.	Nke a abụghị ule.
He has been doing this for two years.	Ọ na-eme nke a afọ abụọ.
So not now, thank you.	Ya mere, ọ bụghị ugbu a, daalụ.
A reporter asked this question.	Onye nta akụkọ jụrụ ajụjụ a.
We should have more than that.	Anyị kwesịrị inwe ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
They like to travel.	Ime njem na-amasị ha.
It is another water.	Ọ bụ mmiri ọzọ.
I let the fear go.	M hapụrụ egwu pụọ.
Finding a job is a real challenge these days.	Ịchọta ọrụ bụ ezigbo ihe ịma aka ụbọchị ndị a.
He told himself that this was his job.	Ọ gwara onwe ya na nke a bụ ọrụ ya.
It’s just there.	Ọ bụ naanị ebe ahụ.
I am one.	Abụ m otu.
I can see his face.	Enwere m ike ịhụ anya ya.
He desperately needed her.	Ọ chọrọ ya nke ukwuu.
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, ha adịghị.
My best friend.	Ezigbo enyi m.
I liked the new feeling.	Mmetụta ọhụrụ ahụ masịrị m.
But sadly that or something similar is the case.	Mana ọ dị nwute na nke ahụ ma ọ bụ ihe yiri ya bụ ikpe ahụ.
He did not want any drink or food.	Ọ chọghị ihe ọṅụṅụ ma ọ bụ nri.
What are you doing ?.	Kedu ihe ị na-eme?.
It was beautiful night and day.	Ọ mara mma abalị na ehihie.
An hour is required.	Achọrọ elekere.
He is surprised when he sees it.	O juru ya anya mgbe ọ hụrụ ya.
But now he can't.	Ma ugbu a, o nweghị ike.
Nothing seems immediately interesting.	Ọ dịghị ihe yiri mmasị ozugbo.
For many, it's not a big deal.	Nye ọtụtụ ndị, ọ bụghị nnukwu ihe.
Not that these things are the same thing.	Ọ bụghị na ihe ndị a bụ otu ihe n'ezie.
And he went out.	O wee pụọ.
It can go on for life.	O nwere ike ịga n'ihu na ndụ niile.
Of course a famous football player.	N'ezie onye ama ama egwuregwu bọọlụ.
I do not know who or where I am going.	Amaghị m onye ma ọ bụ ebe m ga-aga.
I know how much he loves you.	Amaara m otú o si hụ gị n'anya.
This beautiful house is a beautiful vacation spot.	Ụlọ a mara mma bụ ebe ezumike mara mma.
Not the third.	Ọ bụghị nke atọ.
The car veered off course.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ siri n'ụzọ dị egwu pụọ.
Still, it looks happy.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, o yiri obi ụtọ.
The movie ends.	Ihe nkiri ahụ kwụsịrị.
Expect a bit, maybe.	Na-atụ anya ntakịrị, ma eleghị anya.
He left the company due to illness.	Ọ hapụrụ ụlọ ọrụ ahụ n'ihi ọrịa.
I think it is.	Echere m na ọ bụ ya.
So it is.	Ya mere, ọ bụ.
It was something he loved.	Ọ bụ ihe ọ hụrụ n'anya.
Monkeys were afraid of their mother.	Enwe nọ na-atụ egwu nne ha.
But another problem.	Ma nsogbu ọzọ.
It is raining here!	Mmiri juru ebe a!
None of that.	Ọ nweghị nke ọ bụla.
However, we can go elsewhere.	Otú ọ dị, anyị nwere ike ịga ebe ọzọ.
Take a drink.	Were ihe ọṅụṅụ.
Very nice fit in the room.	Akwa ezigbo mma na ime ụlọ.
Let's wait here one night.	Ka anyị chere ebe a otu abalị.
Can't get out of the way.	Enweghị ike ịpụ n'ụzọ.
Then someone said.	Mgbe ahụ, onye kwuru.
Give yourself better.	Nye onwe gị mma.
This is a child.	Nke a bụ nwata.
I want others to feel that way.	Achọrọ m ka ndị ọzọ nwee mmetụta ahụ.
Today is not the day.	Taa abụghị ụbọchị ahụ.
Welcome to my store.	Nnọọ na ụlọ ahịa m.
Now my problem is this.	Ugbu a nsogbu m bụ nke a.
And we did kind of the same thing.	Na anyị mere ụdị otu ụzọ.
What will happen to us?	Gịnị ga-eme anyị?
That was a few years ago.	Ọ bụ afọ ole na ole gara aga.
You got us well.	I nwetara anyị nke ọma.
Or just wherever you like the story.	Ma ọ bụ naanị ebe ọ bụla akụkọ ga-amasị gị.
I do not understand this.	Aghọtaghị m ihe a.
But it can be.	Ma, ọ pụrụ ịbụ.
People with ideas.	Ndị nwere echiche.
But some days the weather is terrible.	Ma ụbọchị ụfọdụ ihu igwe dị egwu.
One executive said the plan was good.	Otu onye isi ọrụ kwuru na atụmatụ a dị mma.
The rest of us do our job.	Anyị ndị ọzọ na-arụ ọrụ anyị.
It can't be done.	Enweghị ike ime ya.
Probably not all of it.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị ya niile.
It is no longer used.	Ejighị ya ọzọ.
No one thought they were great.	Ọ dịghị onye chere na ha dị ukwuu.
Two others are sitting.	Abụọ ndị ọzọ nọ ọdụ.
This creates a positive effect.	Nke a na-eme ka mmetụta dị mma.
In any work.	Na ọrụ ọ bụla.
However, money is not everything.	Otú ọ dị, ego abụghị ihe niile.
But this year will be different.	Ma afọ a ga-adị iche.
This is good news.	Nke a bụ ozi obi ụtọ.
Suddenly, the man realized himself.	Na mberede, nwoke ahụ ghọtara onwe ya.
There was a special lack of interest in the room.	Enwere enweghị mmasị pụrụ iche n'ime ụlọ ahụ.
It's too scary.	Ọ dị oke egwu.
For a long time.	Ogologo oge.
He gave everything.	O nyere ihe niile.
All it is.	Ihe niile ọ bụ.
I don't know him very well.	Amaghị m ya nke ọma.
But it is really scary.	Ma ọ dị egwu n'ezie.
You do not have it in you.	Ị nweghị ya n'ime gị.
Of course, there will be no more.	N'ezie, ọ gaghị adị ọzọ.
It's a lot of things.	Ọ bụ ọtụtụ ihe.
All stupidity, my evil.	Ihe nzuzu niile, ihe ọjọọ m.
I am really happy.	Enwere m obi ụtọ n'ezie.
The other effect is not true.	Mmetụta nke ọzọ abụghị eziokwu.
The plans are as follows.	Atụmatụ a dị ka ndị a.
If he came to that.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bịara na nke ahụ.
It's like a child.	Ọ dị ka nwata.
But it is here.	Ma, ọ bụ ebe a.
You don't see anyone.	Ị naghị ahụ onye ọ bụla.
You just hate work.	Naanị ị kpọrọ ọrụ asị.
Some dogs do but some don’t.	Ụfọdụ nkịta na-eme ma ụfọdụ anaghị eme ya.
He feels like a man.	Ọ na-eche dị ka nwoke.
A very good idea.	A nnọọ mma eleghị anya.
He does everything we want him to do.	Ọ na-eme ihe niile anyị chọrọ ka anyị mee.
Everything works as expected in a full-time application.	Ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ dị ka a tụrụ anya na ngwa oge niile.
Little by little, it is true.	Na nke nta nke nta, ọ bụ eziokwu.
The boat was not a lot of fun for us.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ abụghị ọtụtụ ụgbọ mmiri obi ụtọ nye anyị.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
It's the same everywhere he goes.	Ọ dị otu a ebe ọ bụla ọ gara.
Emergency workers said he died there.	Ndị na-eme ihe mberede kwuru na ọ nwụrụ n'ebe ahụ.
But it is difficult.	Ma o siri ike.
Come the morning you should be yourself.	Bịa ụtụtụ ị kwesịrị ịbụ onwe gị.
However, this is not the case here.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka ọ dị ebe a.
Their first home, their first child.	Ụlọ mbụ ha, nwa mbụ ha.
Everyone with legs knows that.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ụkwụ mara nke ahụ.
He is a good friend.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi.
He does this all the time.	Ọ na-eme nke a mgbe niile.
But how can this do any good?	Ma olee otú nke a pụrụ isi mee ihe ọma ọ bụla?
At first it was a good idea.	Na mbụ bụ ezigbo echiche.
Just stay there.	Naanị nọrọ ebe ahụ.
That is what we should do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị kwesịrị ịdị na-eme.
Where a woman is at home.	Ebe nwanyị nọ n'ụlọ.
His Father is the only one who can.	Nna ya bụ naanị onye nwere ike.
Low service.	Ọrụ dị ala.
It goes on and on.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu.
I really enjoy it.	Ọ na-atọ m ụtọ nke ukwuu.
Everyone else knows them.	Onye ọ bụla ọzọ maara ha.
I miss my time.	Echere m oge m.
Marketplaces are everywhere.	Ebe ahịa juru ebe niile.
We will leave here.	Anyị ga-esi ebe a pụọ.
He cares about it.	Ọ na-eche banyere ya.
But if men don't know it, women really know it.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ụmụ nwoke amaghị ya, ụmụ nwanyị na-ama ya n'ezie.
That is a good gift.	Nke ahụ bụ ezigbo onyinye.
Many people are studying to become doctors.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-agụ akwụkwọ ka ha bụrụ dọkịta.
And not only this.	Ọ bụghị naanị nke a.
The work was fun, and it only took a few hours.	Ọrụ na-atọ ụtọ, ọ were naanị awa ole na ole.
One night of truth.	Otu abalị nke eziokwu.
As a result, many people in this area are starving.	N’ihi ya, ọtụtụ ndị nọ ebe a na-enwe agụụ.
He has a book.	O nwere akwụkwọ.
Too successful.	Oke na-aga nke ọma.
Give them that way.	Nye ha ka ha dị otú ahụ.

But worse yet.	Ma ihe ka njọ ma.
The group got off to a good start.	Ndị otu ahụ malitere njem ahụ nke ọma.
He really liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
It is a small boat.	Ọ bụ obere ụgbọ mmiri.
You can give anything.	Ị nwere ike inye ihe ọ bụla.
The temperature at this time of year is very good.	Okpomọkụ n'oge a nke afọ dị ezigbo mma.
He never asked anyone.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ jụrụ onye ọ bụla.
He did not want to leave the phone.	Ọ chọghị ịpụ na ekwentị.
So far it’s been as simple as that.	Ruo ugbu a ọ dị mfe dị ka nke ahụ.
It comes in many forms.	Ọ nwere ọtụtụ ụdị.

So, they do what they can.	Ya mere, ha na-eme ihe ha nwere ike ime.
But nothing more than that.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ karịa nke ahụ.

Of course, this is far from the only issue.	N'ezie, nke a dị anya na naanị okwu.
But he has authority on his side.	Ma o nwere ikike n'akụkụ ya.

They were made aware of the problem.	E mere ka ha mara nsogbu ahụ.
They are expected to do the impossible.	A na-atụ anya na ha ga-eme ihe agaghị ekwe omume.

There is no talk of food, of course.	E nweghị okwu banyere nri, nke ihe ọ bụla.

Suddenly, like that.	Na mberede, dị ka nke ahụ.

He and his girlfriend are good friends.	Ya na enyi ya nwanyị bụ ezigbo enyi.

The money provided the essentials.	Ego ahụ nyere ihe ndị dị mkpa.

There are many people who are looking for this job.	Enwere ọtụtụ ndị na-achọ ọrụ a.
She is scared, so she stays home.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya, ya mere ọ nọrọ n’ụlọ.

This story is about character.	Akụkọ a gbasara agwa.

Patients can leave the study at any time.	Ndị ọrịa nwere ike ịpụ na ọmụmụ ihe n'oge ọ bụla.

Suppose a company has only one store.	Ka e were ya na otu ụlọ ọrụ nwere naanị ụlọ ahịa.
People living in the tropics will have extreme weather.	Ndị mmadụ bi n'ebe okpomọkụ ga-enwe oke ihu igwe.

Now, some more than others, of course.	Ugbu a, ụfọdụ karịa ndị ọzọ, n'ezie.
We never wanted children.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị chọrọ ụmụaka.
We asked for something different.	Anyị jụrụ ihe dị iche.

She gave him delicious food.	O nyere ya nri dị ụtọ.
But he can see.	Ma ọ pụrụ ịhụ.
I don’t want anything more than your family and you.	Achọghị m ihe ọ bụla karịa ezinụlọ gị na gị.
Dogs will not eat his food.	Nkịta agaghị eri nri ya.
She was obviously upset.	O doro anya na obi adịghị ya mma.
Wood is really hard.	Osisi siri ike n'ezie.
He plays a healthy game.	Ọ na-egwu egwuregwu ahụ ike.
He ordered coffee, and made sure his mind was working again.	O nyere iwu kọfị, wee hụ na uche ya na-arụ ọrụ ọzọ.

I don’t want to think too much, either.	Achọghị m iche echiche nke ukwuu, ma.
But the wife said she would go.	Mana nwunye kwuru na ọ ga-aga.

We are the only way to stop.	Anyị bụ naanị ụzọ isi kwụsị.
The store can take many other employees.	Ụlọ ahịa ahụ nwere ike were ọtụtụ ndị ọrụ ọzọ.
He hated his work.	Ọ kpọrọ ọrụ ya asị.

We need to find a way to stop them.	Anyị kwesịrị ịchọta ụzọ anyị ga-esi kwụsị ha.
It is what you were born to do.	Ọ bụ ihe a mụrụ gị ime.
We asked him his name.	Anyị jụrụ ya aha ya.
This is unreasonable, of course.	Nke a bụ ihe ezi uche na-adịghị na ya, n'ezie.

We never talked about money.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị kwuru banyere ego.
Now she has a baby.	Ugbu a ọ mụrụ nwa.
No merchandise.	Enweghị ngwa ahịa.
They know everything that is going on around them.	Ha maara ihe niile na-eme gburugburu ha.
He did not want to be anywhere else.	Ọ chọghị ịnọ ebe ọzọ.
Please stop calling.	Biko kwụsị ịkpọ.

I looked at it.	M lere ya anya.

We are moving forward.	Anyị na-aga n'ihu.
There are currently two cases.	Enwere ikpe abụọ ugbu a.
You can not do everything.	Ị nweghị ike ime ihe niile.
He excelled at the dance floor.	Ọ gara nke ọma n'akụkụ ala ịgba egwu.
It works well.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
It is long.	Ọ dị ogologo.
And man.	Na nwoke.
No time.	Enweghị oge.
Not the best day, but not the worst.	Ọ bụghị ụbọchị kacha mma, mana ọ bụghị egwu.
It's better.	Ọ dị mma karịa.
Nothing is known about his life.	Ọ dịghị ihe a maara banyere ndụ ya.
Within a period of three weeks.	N'ime oge nke izu atọ.
The dress is too heavy.	Uwe ahụ dị ya oke ibu.
Then it is your eyes.	Mgbe ahụ ọ bụ anya gị.
Go on foot.	Gaa na ụkwụ ụkwụ.
Then there will be no question.	Mgbe ahụ, a gaghị enwe ajụjụ.
This is not a drug.	Ihe kpatara nke a abụghị ọgwụ.
His new condition required frequent travel.	Ọnọdụ ọhụrụ ya chọrọ ka ọ na-eme njem ugboro ugboro.
Now, we are one of its best customers.	Ugbu a, anyị bụ otu n'ime ndị ahịa ya kacha mma.
But he doesn't like it that way.	Ma ọ dịghị amasị ya otú ahụ nso ya.
This can happen for a number of reasons.	Nke a nwere ike ime n'ihi ọtụtụ ihe.
Their words do not make friends.	Okwu ha adịghị eme enyi.
He gave his dog back.	O nyere nkịta ya azụ.
The last few days have been very exciting.	Ụbọchị ole na ole gara aga dị ezigbo ụtọ.
So there we have a hand.	Ya mere, n'ebe ahụ ka anyị nwere aka.
The way to do this is yours.	Otu ị ga-esi mee nke a bụ nke gị.
There are only a few.	Enwere naanị ole na ole.
I have his heart.	Enwere m obi ya.
You too.	Gị onwe gị kwa.
He obviously has the game.	O doro anya na o nwere egwuregwu ahụ.
He thought something terrible was about to happen.	O chere na ihe dị egwu na-aga ime.
Here things are going well.	Ebe a ka ihe na-aga nke ọma.
Let me give you an example.	Ka m nye gị ihe atụ.
He should know that by now.	O kwesịrị ịma nke ahụ ka ọ dị ugbu a.
I play it alone.	M na-egwu ya naanị.
Probably a good idea.	Ma eleghị anya, ezigbo echiche.
But now there is new help and a new life here.	Ma ugbu a enwere enyemaka ọhụrụ na ndụ ọhụrụ ebe a.
When he got to his destination, he collapsed.	Mgbe o rutere ebe ọ na-aga, ọ dara.
His face looked far away.	Ihu ya lere anya dị anya.
A man can be strong physically and mentally.	Nwoke nwere ike ịdị ike na ahụ na uche.
Everything, everything, that is what we are here for.	Ihe niile, ihe ọ bụla, nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị nọ ebe a maka.
So a different approach was taken.	N'ihi ya, e mere ụzọ dị iche.
And if he does, he will do so.	Na ọ bụrụ na o mee nke ahụ, ọ ga-eme ya.
It's a big house.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ụlọ.
To tell you the truth.	Ịgwa gị eziokwu.
We thought about that.	Anyị chere banyere nke ahụ.
I do not know that.	Amaghị m nke ahụ.
What happened?	Kedu ihe mere?.
We are all hungry.	Agụụ na-agụ anyị niile.
Not a good smile.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo ọnụ ọchị.
We are talking about you.	Anyị na-ekwu maka gị.
Her skin is awesome.	Akpụkpọ ahụ ya dị egwu.
Wear your best clothes.	Yiri uwe gị kacha mma.
This is early in the morning.	Nke a n'isi ụtụtụ.
Eat food here.	Ndị riri nri ebe a.
It is the best for the job.	Ọ bụ ya kacha mma maka ọrụ ahụ.
Not too long on course.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ogologo na N'ezie.
Transportation costs are very low.	Ọnụ njem ụgbọ njem dị ntakịrị ntakịrị.
However, it was not long.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị ogologo oge.
For a few days.	Maka ụbọchị ole na ole.
I love them.	Ahụrụ m ha n'anya.
The restaurant is good.	Ibe oriri na ọṅụṅụ dị mma.
But you can do that.	Ma ị nwere ike na-eme nke ahụ.
I am making breakfast.	Ana m eme nri ụtụtụ.
Then see what happens.	Mgbe ahụ hụ ihe na-eme.
The baby is not like its father or mother.	Nwa ọhụrụ ahụ adịghị ka nna ya ma ọ bụ nne ya.
I think that was the worst year of my life.	Echere m na nke ahụ bụ afọ kacha njọ ná ndụ m.
Both were successful.	Ha abụọ nwere ihe ịga nke ọma.

Now that is a different feeling.	Ugbu a nke ahụ bụ mmetụta dị iche.
I do not understand what it is.	Aghọtaghị m ihe ọ bụ.
Thanks for telling me.	Daalụ maka ịgwa m.
Do that.	Mee nke ahụ.
I can't see what happened.	Ahụghị m ihe merenụ.
You know where we are going.	Ị ma ebe anyị na-aga.
But there are different ways around it.	Mana enwere ụzọ dị iche iche gburugburu ya.
Or children.	Ma ọ bụ ụmụaka.
Kind of angry, irrational.	Ụdị iwe na-enweghị okpomọkụ, na-enweghị uche.
You came here to help him.	Ị bịara ebe a iji nyere ya aka.
It just needs to be different.	Ọ chọrọ nnọọ iche.
This is the need of the hour.	Nke a bụ mkpa nke oge awa.
Suffering is greater than necessary.	Ahụhụ dị ukwuu karịa mkpa ọ dị.
Now we can drive.	Ugbu a, anyị nwere ike ịnya ụgbọ ala.
What we do as a company is really important.	Ihe anyị na-eme dị ka ụlọ ọrụ dị mkpa n'ezie.
His grandfather told him the story at one point.	Nna nna ya gwara ya akụkọ ahụ n’otu oge.
That started in practice.	Nke ahụ malitere na omume.
Many people own homes there.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ nwere ụlọ n'ebe ahụ.
Nothing more than before.	Ọ dịghị karịa ka ọ dị na mbụ.

I hope you will be able to do it this way again.	Enwere m olileanya na ị ga-enwe ike ime ya otu a ọzọ.
But he is not alone.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị ya.
Which probably wouldn’t happen to me.	Nke ọ ga-abụ na o nweghị ike ime m.
It's a tough way.	Ọ bụ ụzọ siri ike.
We do not know anyone.	Ọ dịghị onye anyị maara.
I'm not sure this value is low.	Ejighị m n'aka ka uru a dị ala.
We do not know anything about his background.	Anyị amaghị ihe ọ bụla gbasara ebe o si.
That’s because not many.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ihi na ọ bụghị ọtụtụ.
Who lives here?	Onye bi ebe a?
It was his first song.	Ọ bụ egwu mbụ ya.
He looked around.	O lere anya gburugburu.
It would be nice if that.	Ọ ga-adị mma ma ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ.
We work like these.	Anyị na-arụ ọrụ dị ka ndị a.

It was just a temporary break.	Ọ bụ naanị ezumike nwa oge.
He's just a bad guy.	Ọ bụ naanị onye ọjọọ.

The hospital is nearby.	Ụlọ ọgwụ dị nso.
The first race you will go is a long distance.	Ọsọ mbụ ị ga-aga bụ ebe dị anya.
It burns really well in this one.	Ọ gbara ezigbo ọkụ na nke a.

Of course, it was perfect.	N'ezie, ọ zuru oke.
One book at a time.	Otu akwụkwọ n'otu oge.

It was the first of the month.	Ọ bụ nke mbụ nke ọnwa.

Even though you are telling the truth in one thing.	N'agbanyeghị na ị na-ekwu eziokwu na otu ihe .
I continued with it, too.	M gara n'ihu na ya, kwa.
I think it's a little weird.	Echere m na ọ bụ ntakịrị uche.
He looked at the three of them.	O lere ha atọ anya.
There are many other things you can do.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ ị nwere ike ime.
So we left.	Ya mere, anyị hapụrụ.
The company has no license.	Ụlọ ọrụ enweghị ikike.
I like a lot of things.	Ọtụtụ ihe na-amasị m.
Take good care of them if they want more children.	Chọrọ ha nke ọma ma ọ bụrụ na ha chọrọ ọtụtụ ụmụaka.
That is obvious.	Nke ahụ doro anya.

Awesome thing is happening.	N'ezie ihe dị egwu na-eme.

Giving, giving, giving.	Inye ihe, inye ihe, inye ihe.
But they are both very good players.	Ma ha abụọ bụ ezigbo ndị egwuregwu.
Your thinking will help you to act differently.	Echiche gị ga-enyere gị aka ime ihe n'ụzọ dị iche.
He knows them personally.	Ọ maara ha n'onwe ya.

You should know.	Ị kwesịrị ịma.
The faster you do this, the better.	Ka ị na-eme nke a ngwa ngwa, ọ ka mma.
You are very different from it.	Ị dị nnọọ iche na ya.
The room is too hot.	Ime ụlọ dị oke ọkụ.
For food and drink.	Maka oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
The day is not over.	Ụbọchị ahụ adịghị anya.
Or such a thing.	Ma ọ bụ ihe dị otú ahụ.

But it will not be.	Ma ọ gaghị adị.
Give it time, it comes around.	Nye ya oge, ọ na-abịa gburugburu.
His teaching was practical and enjoyable.	Ihe nkuzi ya bara uru ma na-atọ ụtọ.
Your opinion is critical.	Echiche gị dị oke egwu.
But there are many ways that work better than this.	Mana enwere ọtụtụ ụzọ na-arụ ọrụ karịa nke a.
I don't care about the job.	Achọghị m ịma maka ọrụ ahụ.
But the book is solid.	Ma akwụkwọ ahụ siri ike.
It's not his thing.	Ọ bụghị ihe ya.
Which is nice.	Nke dị mma.
It is almost the same story.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ otu akụkọ.
But I will do it if I want to.	Mana m ga-eme ma ọ bụrụ na achọrọ m.
They need to find friends, and quickly.	Ha kwesịrị ịchọta ndị enyi, na ngwa ngwa.

Now he does it.	Ugbu a, ọ na-eme ya.
It is good to see that they are healthy.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ ka ahụ siri ha ike.
There was no talk of a car.	Enweghị okwu ọ bụla ọ banyere ụgbọ ala.
At this point.	N'ebe a.

So to speak.	Ya mere ikwu.

Things would have gone the other way.	Ihe gaara aga n'ụzọ ọzọ.
If it is good or bad.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mma ma ọ bụ adịghị mma.

From this, there is no legal advantage.	Site na nke a, ọ dịghị uru ikpe.

Still, it probably is better that way.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, eleghị anya ka mma otú ahụ.
They never asked her if she wanted it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha jụrụ ya ma ọ̀ chọrọ ya.

Extreme power should not be necessary.	Oke ike ekwesịghị ịdị mkpa.

Strange to say the least, isn’t it?	Ihe dị egwu ikwu, ọ bụghị ya?
He said he understood.	O kwuru na ọ ghọtara.

Of course, the basics need to be clearly seen.	N'ezie, ihe ndị bụ isi kwesịrị ịhụ nke ọma.

At times, the city expects to dig.	N'oge ụfọdụ, obodo na-atụ anya igwu ala.

His time is the most important.	Oge ya kacha mkpa.
But the difference is true.	Ma ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu.
In winter, the river cools.	N'ime oge oyi, osimiri ahụ jụrụ oyi.

Please, please, please.	Biko, biko, biko.
But there are many of us who care.	Ma e nwere ọtụtụ n'ime anyị na-eche banyere.
People should know that it is important.	Ndị mmadụ kwesịrị ịma na ọ dị mkpa.

But nothing came of the heart.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe bịara n'obi.
It is best if you proceed.	Ọ kacha mma ma ọ bụrụ na ịga n'ihu.
No one is wise.	Ọ dịghị onye maara ihe.
All is well.	Ihe niile dị mma.
They know nothing about the terrible disease.	Ha amaghị ihe ọ bụla banyere ọrịa ahụ dị egwu.
Life without feelings is meaningless.	Ndụ na-enweghị mmetụta enweghị isi.

Everything that happens in your life, happens for a reason.	Ihe niile na-eme na ndụ gị, na-eme maka ihe kpatara ya.
Today, you are alone.	Taa, ọ bụ naanị gị.
Someone has to say it.	Mmadụ kwesịrị ikwu ya.

But one thing may be important.	Ma e nwere otu ihe nwere ike ịdị mkpa.
Because I have no money.	N'ihi na enweghị m ego.
The best beautiful photos.	Foto ndị mara mma kacha mma.
Awesome, very beautiful.	Na-atụ egwu, mara mma nke ukwuu.
This is because a great evil would be very foolish.	Nke a bụ n'ihi na nnukwu ihe ọjọọ ga-abụ nnọọ nzuzu.

Maybe a little.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị obere.

Happiness is everything that is important in this life.	Obi ụtọ bụ ihe niile dị mkpa na ndụ a.
They have no real idea of ​​their own power.	Ha enweghị ezi echiche nke ike nke ha.

So head on, but he got it.	Ya mere isi, ma o nwetara ya.
He got in his car.	Ọ banyere ụgbọ ala ya.
True, you know.	Ọ bụ eziokwu, ị mara.

You and your two brothers.	Gị na nwanne gị abụọ.
We need to have both.	Anyị kwesịrị inwe ha abụọ.
His wife and daughter are in the back.	Nwunye ya na nwa ya nwanyị nọrọ n'azụ.

He had doubts about the job.	O nwere obi abụọ banyere ọrụ ahụ.

Something else can happen.	Ihe ọzọ nwere ike ime.
No more days.	Ọ dịghị ụbọchị ọzọ.

The first two of these are obvious.	Abụọ ndị mbụ n'ime ihe ndị a doro anya.
This situation is very different from that of her parents.	Ọnọdụ a dị nnọọ iche na nke ndị mụrụ ya.

Not to mention the plant.	Ọ bụghị ikwu banyere osisi.
Great length of time.	Ogologo oge dị ukwuu.
They are bad.	Ha bụ ndị ọjọọ.

Similarly for those who need help.	N'otu aka ahụ na ndị chọrọ enyemaka.
Well, time goes on.	Ọ, oge na-aga n'ihu.

Please be reasonable before you get angry.	Biko were ezi uche tupu iwe iwe.

So it is with their gift to get it right.	Ya mere, ọ bụ na onyinye ha iji nweta ya nke ọma.

But this is a big nonsense.	Mana nke a bụ nnukwu ihe nzuzu.
I think we should move on.	Echere m na anyị kwesịrị ịga n'ihu.

We know nothing else.	Anyị amaghị ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.

They are afraid of him.	Ha tụrụ ya egwu.
This fact surprised him, not the beauty itself.	Eziokwu a tụrụ ya n'anya, ọ bụghị ịma mma n'onwe ya.

He bought her many gifts.	Ọ zụtara ya ọtụtụ onyinye.
But we want to be parents.	Ma anyị chọrọ ịbụ nne na nna.
No matter who you are or what you say,	N'agbanyeghị onye ị bụ, ma ọ bụ ihe ị na-ekwu,
Ma, ma, ma.	Ma, ma, ma.

Of course now, it.	N'ezie ugbu a, ya.
Of course, we now know that this is the case.	N'ezie, anyị maara ugbu a na nke a bụ ikpe.

He looked around the front door.	Ọ lere anya n'akụkụ ọnụ ụzọ ndị isi.
For me, that’s my story.	Maka m, nke ahụ bụ akụkọ m.
These things are good.	Ihe ndị a dị mma.

Problems like these.	Nsogbu dị ka ndị a.
It seems more important.	Ọ dị ka ọ ka mkpa.
To take a different approach.	Iji were ụzọ dị iche.

If you are not happy, we are not happy.	Ọ bụrụ na ị naghị enwe obi ụtọ, anyị anaghị enwe obi ụtọ.

He enjoys his small game.	Obere egwuregwu ya na-atọ ya ụtọ.
He asked her where her best friend was.	Ọ jụrụ ya ebe ezigbo enyi ya nọ.
He was obviously angry.	O doro anya na iwe were ya.

That's why it's good.	Ọ bụ ya mere o ji dị mma.
But this time it is different.	Ma na nke ugbu a, ọ dị iche.

It's not funny, it's not good.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọchị, ọ dịghị mma.

He does not have it.	Ọ naghị enwe ya.
Some families eat vegetarian food.	Ezinụlọ ụfọdụ na-eri nri anaghị eri anụ.
Both are good.	Ha abụọ dị mma.
But you yourself can not.	Ma gị onwe gị enweghị ike.
The cost here is emotional.	Ọnụ ego ebe a bụ nke mmetụta uche.
This is the house where he made it.	Nke a bụ ụlọ ebe o mere.
It wants to be something else.	Ọ chọrọ ịbụ ihe ọzọ.
I was surprised that they were confident.	O juru m anya na obi siri ha ike.
That seems like the simplest thing at first.	Nke ahụ dị ka ọ dị mfe na mbụ.

But to her surprise, she was amazed.	Ma ịhụ ya tụrụ ya n’anya nke ọma.

His father was a journalist, along with his grandfather.	Nna ya bụ onye nta akụkọ, ya na nna nna ya.

The locals can tell you how to reach them.	Onye obodo nwere ike ịgwa gị ka ị ga-esi ruo ha.
But his wife hated him here.	Ma nwunye ya kpọrọ ya asị ebe a.
I can't tell you how upset I was.	Apụghị m ịgwa gị otú obi m si agba ha.
You have that.	Ị nwere nke ahụ.

But that is not good.	Mana nke ahụ adịghị mma.
He would have said no.	Ọ gaara asị mba.
Do you need more clothes?	Ị ka chọrọ akwa ọzọ?
My mother was right.	Nne m kwuru eziokwu.

Now more than 30 people came.	Ugbu a ihe karịrị mmadụ iri atọ bịara.

They fear their company will have a big impact.	Ha na-atụ egwu na ụlọ ọrụ ha ga-enwe mmetụta dị ukwuu.

I'm sorry, boy.	Ọ dị m nwute, nwa nwoke.
Not only that, you will be happy.	Ọ bụghị naanị nke ahụ ka ị ga-enwe obi ụtọ.
This effect may be due to two factors.	Mmetụta a nwere ike ịbụ n'ihi ihe abụọ.
For me, one is a good word.	Maka m, otu bụ okwu dị mma.
He said they were both fine.	O kwuru na ha abụọ ji mma.
How can we make this a different matter.	Kedu ka anyị ga-esi mee ka nke a bụrụ ihe dị iche iche.
So I panicked.	Ya mere, m gbara egwu.

And the only thing that will do that is man.	Na naanị ihe ga-eme nke ahụ bụ mmadụ.

He was very impressed with the feeling.	Mmetụta ahụ masịrị ya nnọọ.
So useful and useful for me.	Ya mere bara uru na bara uru maka m.
It looks great, but it is also very expensive.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu, mana ọ dị oke ọnụ.

But there is more to the matter.	Ma enwere okwu ka ukwuu.
He asked them.	Ọ jụrụ ha.
That is their life, that is their life.	Nke ahụ bụ ndụ ha, nke ahụ bụ ndụ ha.
No one can imagine that he will do so.	Ọ dịghị onye pụrụ iche na ọ ga-eme otú ahụ.
No one said anything about it.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru banyere ya.
It’s a perfect plan.	Ọ bụ atụmatụ zuru oke.

Whatever the nature of that may be.	Ihe ọ bụla omume nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ.

He knew his brother.	Ọ ma nwanne ya.
It was really beautiful when you entered.	Ọ mara mma n'ezie mgbe ị banyere.
Sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s not.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ọ dị mma, mgbe ụfọdụ adịghị mma.
But then he saw the woman.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ hụrụ nwanyị ahụ.
The staff was very friendly and helpful.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ nwere ezigbo enyi na enyemaka.

But we have no information about your location.	Mana anyị enweghị ozi gbasara ebe ị nọ.
That is very simple, but it is not.	Nke ahụ dị nnọọ mfe, ma ọ bụghị.

About three months.	Ihe dị ka ọnwa atọ.
His idea is unparalleled.	Echiche ya doro anya na-enweghị atụ.

There are several reasons for this perception.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara echiche a.
They play football.	Ha na-agba bọọlụ.
At the very least, she spoke truthfully about her feelings.	Ma ọ́ dịghị ihe ọzọ, o kwuru eziokwu banyere otú obi dị ya.

That is not what actually happened.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe mere n'ezie.
You do both.	Ị na-eme ha abụọ.
He will not want them.	Ọ gaghị achọ ha.
If you can only imagine.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike iche naanị.
Not a doctor.	Ọ bụghị dọkịta.
Unsuccessful, they both stopped.	Enweghị ihe ịga nke ọma, ha abụọ kwụsịrị.
Fresh vegetables are not here.	Akwụkwọ nri ọhụrụ adịghị ebe a.
But some of them are not there.	Ma ụfọdụ n’ime ha anọghị ebe ahụ.
This may sound like a bad word, but it is the same.	Nke a nwere ike ịdị ka okwu na-adịghị mma, mana otu ahụ ka ọ dị.
I do not have time for such things.	Enweghị m oge maka ihe ndị dị otú ahụ.
Life went on.	Ndụ nọ na-aga n'ihu.

This story is nothing more.	Akụkọ a abụghị ihe ọzọ.

This may not be a special emotional film, it is real.	Nke a enweghị ike ịbụ ihe nkiri mmetụta pụrụ iche, ọ dị adị.
If he wants to.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ chọrọ.

He saw the look on my face.	Ọ hụrụ otú ihu m dị.
Circumstances are what it is.	Ọnọdụ bụ ihe ọ bụ.
That is another story.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ọzọ.
But this situation is what it is.	Ma ọnọdụ a bụ ihe ọ bụ.
He invited some of his friends over for his meal.	Ọ kpọrọ ụfọdụ ndị enyi ya ka ha rie nri ya.
But you are mine now.	Mana ị bụ nke m ugbu a.

The name of the station is original.	Aha ọdụ ụgbọ ahụ bụ na mbụ .
She wondered what the man was thinking.	Ọ nọ na-eche ihe nwoke ahụ na-eche.
Suddenly, he pointed.	Na mberede, ọ tụrụ aka.
But it will still go.	Mana ọ ka ga-aga.
As expected.	Dị ka ọ tụrụ anya ya.

There is a little something.	Enwere ntakịrị ihe.

He thought about it.	O chere banyere ya .
The man is good.	Nwoke ahụ dị mma.
He is very happy.	Obi dị ya ụtọ nke ukwuu.
They cannot have both.	Ha enweghị ike inwe ha abụọ.
Only two things are necessary.	Naanị ihe abụọ dị mkpa.

It is very small.	Ọ dị nnọọ obere.
Stay in them.	Nọrọ n'ime ha.
Your body will be like theirs.	Ahụ gị ga-adị ka nke ha.

Not a big deal.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu ọgwụ.
Now her son is doing the same thing, twice.	Ugbu a nwa ya nwoke na-eme otu ụzọ ahụ, ugboro abụọ.
For me, this is the time.	Maka m, nke a bụ oge.
We are not far from that now.	Anyị anọghị ebe dị anya na nke ahụ ugbu a.
But her other body, and that beautiful, fast mind.	Ma ahụ ya ndị ọzọ, na nke ahụ mara mma, ngwa ngwa uche.
Life goes where it goes.	Ndụ na-aga ebe ọ na-aga.
And around everyone.	Na gburugburu onye ọ bụla.
He looked everywhere but to no avail.	O lere anya ebe niile mana o nweghị isi.
The first step is to think about your dad.	Nke mbụ bụ ka i nwee ike iche banyere nna gị.
These girls can be awesome!	Ụmụ agbọghọ ndị a nwere ike ịdị egwu!
Life is not better than this.	Ndụ adịghị mma karịa nke a.

Every child is different.	Nwata ọ bụla dị iche.
They are all the same employee.	Ha niile bụ otu onye ọrụ.

He wanted her to know that.	Ọ chọrọ ka ọ mara nke ahụ.
Water is basic.	Mmiri bụ isi.

She said she was not his mother.	Ọ kwuru na ọ bụghị nne ya.
None of us do it well.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị na-eme ya nke ọma.
But you have little time to do much.	Mana ị nwere obere oge iji mee ọtụtụ ihe.
They spoke of their authority.	Ha kwuru maka ikike ha.
But it is different.	Ma ọ dị iche na ya.
But he was not the only one.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị otu, ọ bụ ya bụ onye mbụ.
So there are such people.	N'ihi ya, e nwere ndị dị otú ahụ.
The water stopped flowing at night.	Mmiri ahụ kwụsịrị n'abalị.

Of course he does.	N'ezie ọ na-eme ya.
His teacher spoke again.	Onye nkuzi ya kwuru okwu ọzọ.

They will not eat.	Ha agaghị eri nri.
Vacation area for school teachers?	Ebe ezumike maka ndị nkuzi ụlọ akwụkwọ?

Twenty years ago today.	Afọ iri abụọ gara aga taa.
Take your family on a road trip.	Were ezinụlọ gị gaa njem njem.
And everyone saw a good opportunity.	Na onye ọ bụla hụrụ ezigbo ohere.
But it is important.	Ma ọ dị mkpa.
It’s just everything.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe niile.
They have different rules for everything.	Ha nwere iwu dị iche maka ihe niile.
The first is family.	Nke mbụ bụ ezinụlọ.
I'll tell you when.	Aga m agwa gị mgbe.
But that ended a few years ago.	Mana nke ahụ kwụsịrị afọ ole na ole gara aga.
He has a plan, he said.	O nwere atụmatụ, o kwuru.
He saw that his music was real.	Ọ hụrụ na egwu ya dị adị.
But that would be, of course, perfect.	Ma nke ahụ ga-abụ, n'ezie, zuru oke.
It was their last chance.	Ọ bụ ohere ikpeazụ ha nwere.

He did the same.	O mere otu ihe ahụ.
You finally got it.	Ị mechara nweta ya.
Or make it stop.	Ma ọ bụ mee ka ọ kwụsị.
So what happens to it?	Ya mere, gịnị na-eme ya?
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
It is that simple.	Ọ dị mfe otú ahụ.
I looked at them.	M lere ha anya.
What is worse is the failure.	Nke ka njọ bụ na ọ dara.
She gave birth to a daughter.	Ọ mụrụ nwa nwanyị.
Now that’s a little different story.	Ugbu a nke ahụ bụ ntakịrị akụkọ dị iche.
It is a very important question.	Ọ bụ ajụjụ dị oke mkpa.
He knew the trouble when he saw it.	Ọ ma nsogbu mgbe ọ hụrụ ya.
It is small but difficult.	Ọ dị obere mana o siri ike.
Those were the best times.	Oge ndị ahụ bụ oge kacha mma.
I left him his way.	M hapụrụ ya ụzọ ya.
I have serious doubts.	Enwere m obi abụọ nke ukwuu.
One fire, one water.	Otu ọkụ, otu mmiri.
It can not be helped.	Enweghị ike inyere ya aka.
However, perhaps once or twice, it will not happen.	Otú ọ dị, ma eleghị anya otu ugboro ma ọ bụ ugboro abụọ, ọ gaghị adị.
Once you get it, you have it.	Ozugbo ị nwetara ya, ị nwere ya.
Each case is different, but they are all the same.	Ikpe nke ọ bụla dị iche, ma ha niile bụ otu.
There is no way around that.	Enweghị ụzọ gburugburu nke ahụ.
That again.	Nke ahụ ọzọ.
Lots of games.	Ọtụtụ egwuregwu.
Everything is the same.	Ihe niile dị otu.
Everyone ate well.	Onye ọ bụla riri nri nke ọma.

Many people are like that.	Ọtụtụ ndị dị ka ya.

Not many families.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ezinụlọ.
This can be done at any time of the year.	Enwere ike ime nke a oge ọ bụla n'afọ.

Last time for you.	Oge ikpeazụ maka gị.
My friend bought me this.	Enyi m zụtara m ihe a.

My life being mine again, that’s good.	Ndụ m ịbụ nke m ọzọ, nke ahụ dị mma.

He knew that they would not survive.	Ọ maara na ha agaghị adị ndụ.
If he gets enough time, he will be a good fit.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ nweta oge zuru oke, ọ ga-abụ ezigbo mma.
Although it is not so.	N'agbanyeghị na ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
He will do whatever he tells him.	Ọ ga-eme ihe ọ bụla ọ gwara ya.
His power is limited.	Ike ya nwere oke.
Everyone has this condition.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ọnọdụ a.
You both want it.	Unu abụọ chọrọ ya.
You have a wife and child.	Ị nwere nwunye na nwa.
As it has a place to be.	Dị ka o nwere ebe ọ ga-abụ.
Nobody liked it.	Ọ dịghị onye masịrị ya.
The idea is in the mind.	Echiche dị na uche.
We have all the rights we have today.	Anyị nwere ikike niile anyị nwere taa.
Always fun.	Na-atọ ụtọ mgbe niile.
I have done a lot with him over the last few weeks.	Mụ na ya mere ọtụtụ ihe n'ime izu ole na ole gara aga.
They are scared.	Ha na-atụ ụjọ.
This is very good.	Nke a dị ezigbo mma.
You just have enough time.	Ị nwere naanị oge zuru oke.
There was not much interest near my house.	Enweghị mmasị dị ukwuu n'akụkụ ụlọ m.
The chance of being your friend may be a little slow.	Ohere ịbụ enyi gị nwere ike ịla azụ ntakịrị.

Not black boys and girls.	Ọ bụghị ụmụ nwoke na ụmụ agbọghọ ojii.
There are so many things to do,	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe ime,
Only, it is.	Naanị, ọ dị.
Suddenly, his eyes lit up.	Na mberede, anya ya gbara ọkụ.
Both of them.	Ha abụọ.
I am his sister.	Abụ m nwanne ya nwanyị.
They take the truth seriously.	Ha anaghị eji eziokwu egwu egwu egwu.
I love that.	Ahụrụ m ihe ahụ n'anya.
Of course, there are those who are looking for books.	N'ezie, e nwere ndị na-achọ akwụkwọ.
They surprised each other.	Ha tụrụ ibe ha n’anya.
I ate a lot of it.	M riri ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
However, it is not infinite.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị na-enweghị oke.
This can be considered as extreme.	Enwere ike were nke a dị ka oke oke.
He would not tell me.	Ọ gaghị agwa m.
These are not the houses we go to church.	Ọ bụghị ụlọ ndị anyị na-aga ụlọ ụka.
This is an important issue.	Nke a bụ okwu dị mkpa.
This case is this.	Ikpe a bụ nke a.
The boss told me to make a new one.	Onye isi gwara m ka m mee otu ọhụrụ.
Another thing, too.	Ihe ọzọ, kwa.
I have a heart.	Enwere m obi.
Give me priority.	Nye m ikike ibu ụzọ.
That is not a problem for you.	Nke ahụ abụghị nsogbu nye gị.
This is coming problematic.	Nke a na-abịa nsogbu.

It's better.	Ọ ka mma.
The price is very reasonable.	Ọnụ ahịa dị nnọọ ezi uche.
We are very happy about that.	Obi dị anyị ezigbo ụtọ na nke ahụ.
Her husband stopped seeing her.	Di ya kwụsịrị ịhụ ya.
You are not waiting for your father or his wife.	Ị dịghị echere nna gị ma ọ bụ nwunye ya.
Now he thinks about it.	Ugbu a o chere banyere ya.
We cannot hold back now.	Anyị enweghị ike ịla azụ ugbu a.
It is well known for its swimming.	A maara ya nke ọma maka egwuregwu igwu mmiri.
Or more, you may want to.	Ma ọ bụ karịa, enwere ike ịchọrọ.
Tell them what they should know, not what you know.	Gwa ha ihe ha kwesịrị ịma, ọ bụghị ihe ị maara.
A perfect life now.	Ndụ nke zuru oke ugbu a.
Many people think this is different.	Ọtụtụ ndị chere na nke a dị iche.
But he was not alone.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị ya ka ụjọ na-atụ ya.
I was surprised.	O juru m anya.
He has no job.	O nweghị ọrụ.
The tower has four rooms.	Ụlọ elu ahụ nwere ọnụ ụlọ anọ.
I love it but I don’t know what to do.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya mana amaghị m ihe m ga-eme.
He said they would.	O kwuru na ha ga-eme ya.
Cooking meat at high temperatures is not good.	Isi nri anụ na oke okpomọkụ adịghị mma.
Some people can't.	Ụfọdụ ndị enweghị ike.
The principal asked some questions about the building.	Onye isi ahụ jụrụ ajụjụ ụfọdụ gbasara ụlọ ahụ.
They live here.	Ha bi ebe a.
It does not seem to be.	O yighị ka ọ dị.
But the color of your car is important.	Ma agba nke ụgbọ ala gị dị mkpa.
But there are some, of course.	Ma enwere ụfọdụ, n'ezie.
Often, more than one thing will be necessary.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ihe karịrị otu ihe ga-adị mkpa.
The chief was angry.	Iwe were onye isi ahụ.
I want to see what, anything, do.	Achọrọ m ịhụ ihe, ihe ọ bụla, mee.
Everything is ready.	Ihe niile dị njikere.
The meeting will be at 3 p.m.	Nzukọ a ga-abụ n'elekere atọ.
He is black.	Ọ bụ nwa ojii.
You are not alone.	Ọ bụghị naanị gị.
But this has no effect.	Ma nke a enweghị mmetụta.
Next to you is my cousin.	N'akụkụ gị bụ nwa nwanne nna m.

His mental state is clear.	Ọnọdụ uche ya doro anya.
Go get them !.	Gaa nweta ha!.
I am very scared.	Ụjọ na-atụ m nke ukwuu.
It is about power and money.	Ọ bụ maka ike na ego.
Thank you very much.	Daalụ nke ukwuu.
But it is not good.	Ma ọ dịghị mma.
Certainly some things beyond your control.	N'ezie, ụfọdụ ihe karịrị ike gị.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
For it all.	Maka ya niile.
History is real.	Akụkọ ihe mere eme dị adị.
It goes on and on.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu.
However, there are many things around us that are important to us.	Otú ọ dị, ọtụtụ ihe dị anyị mkpa dị anyị gburugburu.
Expect words.	Na-atụ anya okwu.
The actor was sitting in front of him.	Onye na-eme ihe nkiri nọ ọdụ n'ihu ya.
I feel like they know we are here.	Ọ dị m ka ha ma na anyị nọ ebe a.
He dreaded these buildings.	Ọ na-atụ ụlọ ndị a egwu.
Of course, different types of land planning will make everyone feel special.	N'ezie, ụdị atụmatụ ala dị iche iche ga-eme ka onye ọ bụla nwee mmetụta pụrụ iche.
Everyone did wrong.	Onye ọ bụla mere ihe ọjọọ.
And everything else they do.	Na ihe ọ bụla ọzọ ha na-eme.
That is not a real problem.	Nke ahụ abụghị ezigbo nsogbu.
They are bad.	Ha bụ ndị ọjọọ.
I will not be those things.	Agaghị m abụ ihe ndị ahụ.
Both will continue.	Ha abụọ ga-aga n'ihu.
You do not want it.	Ị chọghị ya.
He has you.	O nwere gị.
She is thinking about her son, she thinks.	Ọ na-eche banyere nwa ya nwoke, o chere.
What does that man do for life?	Gịnị ka nwoke ahụ na-eme maka ndụ?
People are so scared all around.	Ndị mmadụ dị nnọọ egwu gburugburu.
All sorts of things.	Ụdị ihe niile.
Close, but impossible to take.	Dị nso, ma ọ gaghị ekwe omume ka ọ were.
They are on their way.	Ha na-aga n'ụzọ.
No company can survive without customers.	Ọ dịghị ụlọ ọrụ nwere ike ịdị ndụ na-enweghị ndị ahịa.
My bad then.	Ihe ọjọọ m mgbe ahụ.
The hardest part will be the prison life.	Ihe isi ike ga-abụ na ndụ ụlọ mkpọrọ.
Therefore, words themselves are important.	Ya mere, okwu n'onwe ha dị mkpa.
It is beautiful but unparalleled.	Ọ mara mma mana enweghị atụ.
Try to do it.	Na-agbalị ime ya.
Tell him something.	Gwa ya ihe.
The room has no lights.	Ime ụlọ ahụ enweghị ọkụ.
Still, the path has a clear limit.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ụzọ ahụ nwere oke doro anya.
He did well.	O mere mma.
Of course, there are two dimensions in the current study.	N'ezie, enwere oke abụọ na ọmụmụ ihe ugbu a.
But he stayed awake.	Ma ọ mụrụ anya.
The task is not as simple as it sounds.	Ọrụ ahụ adịghị mfe dị ka ọ dị.
For three months now.	Ruo ọnwa atọ ugbu a.
How can you believe everything he tells you?	Olee otú ị ga-esi kwere ihe ọ bụla ọ gwara gị?
Because it is.	N'ihi na ọ bụ ya.
The trip was beautiful.	Njem ahụ mara mma.
He was born.	A mụrụ ya.
But the event was undoubtedly special.	Ma, obi abụọ adịghị ya na ihe omume ahụ pụrụ iche.
He is beyond the reach of mere humans.	Ọ karịrị ike mmadụ ọ bụla.
Good night, of course.	Abalị ọma, n'ezie.
The thinker will not make such confidence.	Onye na-eche echiche agaghị eme ụdị obi ike dị otú ahụ.
I'm sure my parents missed me but they understood.	Eji m n’aka na ndị mụrụ m na-atụ m uche mana ha ghọtara.
I know it exists, and so do others.	Ama m na ọ dị, na ndị ọzọ kwa.
I don’t know how he will feel about this story.	Amaghị otú ọ ga-esi na-eche banyere akụkọ a.
Then some of them can see it very clearly.	Mgbe ahụ ụfọdụ n'ime ha nwere ike ịhụ ya nke ukwuu.
But something different happened.	Ma ihe dị iche mere.
But for everyone.	Ma maka onye ọ bụla.
He did not know why.	Ọ maghị ihe kpatara ya.
Several times.	Ọtụtụ ugboro.
Nothing in the distance.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị na anya.
They have a good thing.	Ha nwere ezigbo ihe.
That would be another book.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ akwụkwọ ọzọ.
You have a chance.	Ị nwere ohere.
There will be no challenges and limits.	Agaghị enwe ihe ịma aka na oke.
Everything should be working now.	Ihe niile kwesịrị ịdị na-arụ ọrụ ugbu a.
He knew he should not.	Ọ maara na ya ekwesịghị.
I can't see where you did this.	Apụghị m ịhụ ebe i mere ihe a.
It's so scary, so scary.	Ọ dị oke egwu, oke egwu.
The way he told me he loved me.	Otú o si agwa m na ya hụrụ m n’anya.
He went home.	Ọ gara n'ụlọ.
My study is important.	Ọmụmụ ihe m dị mkpa.
We both did.	Anyị abụọ mere.
He said he had.	O kwuru na ya nwere.
There are two possible reasons for this.	Enwere ihe abụọ nwere ike ime nke a.
These are more than anyone, should know.	Ndị a bụ ndị karịa onye ọ bụla, kwesịrị ịma.
I would have liked it.	Ọ gaara atọ m ụtọ.
I like it.	Enwere m mmasị na ya.
It can be invaluable to do so.	Ọ nwere ike ịbụ ihe bara uru na-enweghị atụ ime.
Do your best work with the people you know.	Na-arụ ọrụ gị kacha mma na ndị ị maara.
They are still strong.	Ha ka siri ike.
These are bad ideas.	Ndị a bụ echiche na-adịghị mma.
Then he was happy.	Mgbe ahụ, obi dị ya ụtọ.
I am the only customer.	Abụ m naanị onye ahịa.
That did not happen this time around.	Nke ahụ emeghị na nke ugbu a.
He told them what he thought.	Ọ gwara ha ihe bụ́ echiche ya.
How did it happen? 	Olee otú o si mee?
Three months of the best year.	Ọnwa atọ nke afọ kacha mma.
The price is very high.	Ọnụ ahịa dị elu nke ukwuu.
But one must be able to do something.	Ma onye ga-enwe ike ime ihe.
I love the work.	Enwere m mmasị na ọrụ ahụ.
Anyone can do that.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ike ime nke ahụ.
I want to go see it.	Achọrọ m ịga hụ ya.
They leave temporarily.	Ha pụrụ nwa oge.
Not my point.	Ọ bụghị isi okwu m.
It’s an uninteresting book.	Ọ bụ akwụkwọ na-enweghị mmasị.
This is my mother.	Nke a bụ nne m.
I have no idea at this point.	Enweghị m echiche n'oge a.
We stayed at his restaurant for a week.	Anyị nọrọ n'ụlọ nri ya otu izu.
One song has something to say.	Otu egwu nwere ihe ikwu.
He was unaware that his friend might be violent.	Ọ maghị na enyi ya nwere ike ime ihe ike.
But we must be reasonable.	Ma anyị kwesịrị inwe ezi uche.
And life is.	Na ndụ bụ.
This will make the shoes more comfortable.	Nke a ga-eme ka akpụkpọ ụkwụ mara mma.
It is good for the season.	Ọ dị mma maka oge a.
But only then.	Mana naanị mgbe ahụ.
We do not know what to do.	Anyị amaghị ihe anyị ga-eme.
The name I did not see anything.	Aha ahụ ahụghị m ihe ọ bụla.
It will never happen.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-eme.
It is so beautiful in it.	Ọ mara nnọọ mma na ya.
Because we have a problem.	N'ihi na anyị nwere nsogbu.
He should know.	O kwesịrị ịma.
But no one can.	Ma ọ dịghị onye nwere ike.
They thought.	Ha chere n'anya.
Again.	Ọzọ.
It should be beautiful.	O kwesịrị ịma mma.
We can say then, 'he said.	Anyị nwere ike ikwu mgbe ahụ,' ka o kwuru.
The new president is facing a difficult task right now.	Onye isi ala ọhụrụ ahụ na-eche ọrụ siri ike ihu ugbu a.
In it, himself.	Na ya, onwe ya.
We need your health.	Ahụ ike gị dị anyị mkpa.

He gave me a chance.	O nyere m ohere.
It was only one day.	Ọ bụ naanị otu ụbọchị.
The talk ended shortly before noon.	Okwu ahụ kwụsịrị obere oge tupu ehihie.

He saw it as an opportunity.	O were ya dị ka ohere.
The dog's face is so funny!	Otú ihu nkịta ahụ dị na-atọ ọchị!
He is alone.	Ọ nọ naanị ya.
Long-term benefits, no.	Uru ogologo oge, mba.
I need to know better.	Ekwesịrị m ịma nke ọma.
Let's not talk about it again.	Ka anyị ghara ikwu banyere ya ọzọ.
Maybe he heard it.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ nụrụ ya.
This group was given permission only for food.	E nyere otu a ikike naanị maka nri.
There is nothing in it.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị na ya.
She is a woman who seeks the truth.	Ọ bụ nwanyị na-achọ eziokwu.
But there is still much to be done.	Ma a ka nwere ọtụtụ ihe a ga-eme.
Now.	Ugbu a.
Much through life.	Ọtụtụ site na ndụ.
President, thank you for your kind words.	Onye isi ala, daalụ maka okwu ọma gị.
Get them new clothes.	Nwetara ha uwe ọhụrụ.
The two women are happy.	Ụmụ nwanyị abụọ ahụ nwere obi ụtọ.
The doctor had an accident.	Dọkịta nwere ihe mberede.
This is not a game, however, "no game".	Nke a abụghị egwuregwu, Otú ọ dị, "ọ dịghị egwuregwu".
Her son had a beautiful job in front of him.	Nwa ya nwoke nwere ọrụ mara mma n'ihu ya.
I was as happy as possible.	Enwere m obi ụtọ dị ka enwere ike.
There is nothing in the car.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị n'ime ụgbọ ala.

It is fresh and happy.	Ọ dị ọhụrụ na obi ụtọ.
He interviewed her.	Ọ jụrụ ya ajụjụ ọnụ.
If it works for you it works for.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka gị ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka.
Or want to.	Ma ọ bụ chọrọ.
His hometown needs good transportation.	Obodo ya chọrọ ụgbọ njem nke ọma.

Those eyes told me a lot.	Anya ndị ahụ gwara m ọtụtụ ihe.
I love the big room.	Ahụrụ m nnukwu ime ụlọ n'anya.
It's not a game.	Ọ bụghị egwuregwu.
We do not know where we are going.	Anyị amaghị ebe anyị ga-aga.
But having it as a big person is important.	Mana inwe ya ka ọ bụrụ nnukwu mmadụ dị mkpa.
It's like a child.	Ọ dị ka nwata.
We can all find ways to stay independent.	Anyị niile nwere ike ịchọta ụzọ anyị ga-esi nọrọ onwe anyị.
Bad people make it easy.	Ndị ọjọọ na-eme ka ọ dị mfe.
Some people are afraid of its effects.	Ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ na-atụ egwu mmetụta ya.
Your second language.	Asụsụ nke abụọ gị.
No more words.	Enweghị okwu ọzọ.
Others died inside.	Ndị ọzọ nwụrụ n'ime.
There are no questions.	Enweghị ajụjụ ọ bụla.
There are many of them.	E nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
We did well with them.	Anyị na ha mere nke ọma.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	O yikarịrị ka ọ bụ ihe mere ya.
Of course you do not.	N'ezie ị naghị eme ya.
He invited her to come, but not to stay.	Ọ kpọrọ ya ka ọ bịa, ma ọ bụghị ka ọ nọrọ.
He never left.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ pụọ.
But something happened.	Ma o nwere ihe mere.
He is afraid.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya.
Type of head.	Ụdị isi isi.
He doesn't like me.	O nweghị mmasị n'ebe m nọ.
It immediately began with community events.	Ọ malitere ozugbo n'ihe omume obodo.
Knowing more than that.	Ịma ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
Restaurant, and not so beautiful.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ, na ọ bụghị nke mara mma.
Then get the rules on the side.	Wee nweta iwu n'akụkụ.
They want something.	Ha chọrọ ihe.
It's clear.	O doro anya.
She is sad.	Obi adịghị ya mma.
He gave a reason.	O kwuru ihe kpatara ya.
However, the case before us is different.	Otú ọ dị, ikpe dị n'ihu anyị dị iche.
He never left.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ pụọ.
Everything is in their hands.	Ihe niile dị n’aka ha.
No more true stories.	Enweghị akụkọ eziokwu ọzọ.
Anyone can say that.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ike ikwu nke ahụ.
I know everything about the woman.	Amaara m ihe niile gbasara nwanyị ahụ.
It will not go far.	Ọ gaghị aga ebe dị anya.
Not true, but it is true.	Ọ bụghị eziokwu, mana ọ bụ eziokwu.
It appeals to everyone.	Ọ na-amasị onye ọ bụla.
We have nothing.	Anyị enweghị ihe ọ bụla.
They are just everywhere.	Ha nọ nnọọ ebe niile.
Just have one.	Naanị nwee otu.
No.	Ọ dịghị.
It looks so pretty.	Ọ dị ka ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
It is the way.	Ọ bụ ụzọ.
Then he met his friends.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ zutere ndị enyi ya.
Spiritual power if you will to do it.	Ikike mmụọ ma ọ bụrụ na ị ga-eme ya.
But they can't do anything '.	Ma ha enweghị ike ime ihe ọ bụla'.
The place is far from awesome.	Ebe dị anya site na ebe dị egwu.
We left early in the morning to the airport.	Anyị hapụrụ n'isi ụtụtụ ruo ọdụ ụgbọ elu.
She asked what her husband had given her.	Ọ jụrụ ihe di ya nyere ya.
I only need one small space.	Naanị otu obere ohere achọrọ m.
All of these are reasons for our happiness.	Ihe ndị a niile bụ ihe mere anyị ga-eji nwee obi ụtọ.
This is how he got the look.	Otu a ka o siri nweta anya.
People he may not have.	Ndị o nwere ike ọ gaghị enwe.
We need this man so much.	Anyị chọrọ nwoke a nke ukwuu.
Just one more time.	Naanị otu oge ọzọ.
The company has financial problems.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ nwere nsogbu ego.
Nothing required.	Enweghị ihe achọrọ.
And other practices.	Na omume ndị ọzọ.
So that is not a question.	N'ihi ya, nke ahụ abụghị ajụjụ.
He thought the weather was bad.	O chere na ọnọdụ mmiri adịghị mma.
I feel very good.	Ọ dị m mma nke ọma.

You make everyone afraid.	Ị na-eme onye ọ bụla egwu.
We bought the house as a gift.	Anyị ji ego zụta ụlọ ahụ dị ka onyinye.
You do not really know how much water you will need.	Ị maghị n'ezie mmiri ole ị ga-achọ.
He talks about why he did it.	Ọ na-ekwu banyere ya mere ya.
I'm sure you do.	Eji m n'aka na ị na-eme ya.
I actually saw that.	Ahụrụ m nke ahụ n'ezie.
And everyone, of course.	Na onye ọ bụla, n'ezie.
I do not own anything.	Adịghị m ihe ọ bụla na-enweghị ụlọ.
This is how you get it, this is how you got it.	Otu a ka ị chọrọ ya, otu a ka i siri nweta ya.
This is my biological father.	Nke a bụ nna mụrụ m.
There is not much we can do.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ihe anyị nwere ike ime.
I want to talk to him.	Achọrọ m ịgwa ya okwu.
Thus, one way per user has no effect on the other two ways.	Ya mere, otu ụzọ onye ọrụ ọ bụla enweghị mmetụta na ụzọ abụọ ndị ọzọ.
It's very simple.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe.

You left when it happened.	Ị hapụrụ mgbe ọ na-eme.

It doesn't do anything.	Anaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.
And more information.	Na ozi ndị ọzọ.
For months, she was left with no message.	Ruo ọtụtụ ọnwa, ọ hapụrụ ya ozi.
Stop talking.	Kwụsị okwu gị.
I would rather have more energy.	Ọ ga-amasị m karịa iji ike karịa.
I’m sure he misses my dad.	O doro m anya na ọ na-atụ m nna m.
There is only one person he can be.	Enwere naanị otu onye ọ nwere ike ịbụ.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
It's too bad.	Ọ dị nnọọ njọ.

Good morning, everyone.	Ụtụtụ ọma, onye ọ bụla.
He was enjoying a good time in his life.	Ọ nọ na-enwe ezigbo oge ná ndụ ya.
Of course, this type of application has its place.	N'ezie, ụdị ngwa ngwa a nwere ebe ya.

We do not recommend that children be present.	Anyị agaghị atụ aro ka ụmụaka nọrọ ebe ahụ na-eme ya.

He was not so strong that he died.	Ọ dịghị ike nke na ọ nwụrụ.

That's how it was done.	Otú ahụ ka e mere ya.
So we gave birth to him very much that year.	Ya mere, anyị mụrụ ya nke ukwuu n'afọ ahụ.
It was a very cold night.	Abalị ahụ bụ ezigbo oyi.
The mother fell ill.	Nne dara ọrịa.

It was a big problem, no doubt.	Ọ bụ nnukwu nsogbu, obi abụọ adịghị ya.
You are sure that you will not tell him.	O doro gị anya na ị gaghị agwa ya.
Then they stopped.	Mgbe ahụ, ha kwụsịrị.

But this method does not work very well.	Mana ụzọ a adịghị arụ ọrụ nke ukwuu.
You can go around it and see what you think.	Ị nwere ike ịgba ya gburugburu wee hụ ihe ị chere.

Tell them what they think.	Gwa ha ka ha chere.
That is not so important.	Nke ahụ adịghị mkpa nke ukwuu.
Then the word goes around.	Mgbe ahụ okwu na-aga gburugburu.
When people are not successful, they move on.	Mgbe ndị mmadụ na-enweghị ihe ịga nke ọma, ha na-aga n'ihu.

Everything else fell apart.	Ihe ndị ọzọ niile dara.

He was running on time, but he should be there now.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ n'oge, ma o kwesịrị ịnọ ebe ahụ ugbu a.
Obviously it does.	O doro anya na ọ na-eme.
That's not bad.	Nke ahụ adịghị njọ.

We want everyone to know what we enjoy.	Anyị chọrọ ka onye ọ bụla mara ụdị ụtọ anyị na-enwe.
That is a different story.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ dị iche.

It looks like a big city.	Ọ dị ka nnukwu obodo.
There are three things in this law.	Enwere ihe atọ dị na iwu a.
We cannot do it alone.	Anyị enweghị ike ime ya naanị anyị.
This is very simple.	Nke a dị nnọọ mfe.
His mother watched him closely.	Nne ya lere ya anya nke ukwuu.
He looked at me.	O lere m anya.
It doesn't seem to be long.	Ọ dị ka ọ gaghị adị anya.
In the face of what is happening.	N'ihu ihe na-eme.
Coffee head is unhealthy.	Isi kọfị bụ nke na-adịghị mma.
It is important for many reasons.	Ọ dị mkpa maka ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
When, of course, he knew nothing.	Mgbe, n'ezie, ọ maghị ihe ọ bụla.
This is not a short time.	Nke a abụghị obere oge.
He told me last time that he loved me.	Ọ gwara m oge ikpeazụ na ya hụrụ m n’anya.
He had a big job.	O nwere nnukwu ọrụ.
But he knew he understood.	Ma ọ maara na ọ ghọtara.
He looked at the moon.	O lere ọnwa anya.
Only they can do it.	Naanị ha nwere ike ime ya.
They said so at home.	Ha kwuru otú ahụ n'ụlọ.

Unfortunately nothing is done about it.	Ọ dị nwute na ọ nweghị ihe a na-eme maka ya.

One thing that will need to be prepared for is the question.	Otu ihe ọ ga-adị mkpa ka ọ dị njikere maka ya bụ ajụjụ.
This is perfect.	Nke a zuru oke.
That is his name.	Ọ bụ aha ya.
Few people did.	Mmadụ ole na ole mere.
But it does not work.	Mana ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
Some patients will have none, others will have many.	Ụfọdụ ndị ọrịa agaghị enwe nke ọ bụla, ndị ọzọ ga-enwe ọtụtụ.

He reads the newspaper every day.	Ọ na-agụ akwụkwọ akụkọ kwa ụbọchị.
The food is good, the company is better.	Nri ahụ dị mma, ụlọ ọrụ ahụ ka mma.
This will be for their story.	Nke a ga-abụ maka akụkọ ha.
Then we know what you really need.	Mgbe ahụ anyị maara ihe dị gị mkpa n'ezie.
Of course not.	N'ezie, ọ dịghị ihe.
They are not like us.	Ha adịghị ka anyị.
But you are young.	Mana ị bụ nwata.
No one can.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike.
She is a patient who comes to see me.	Ọ bụ onye ọrịa na-abịa ịhụ m.
This is night.	Nke a bụ abalị.
That is what he does.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ na-eme.
But again, nothing.	Ma ọzọ, ọ dịghị ihe.
We are not just another face.	Anyị abụghị naanị ihu ọzọ.
Again, they refused.	Ọzọ, ha jụrụ.
This woman is pregnant.	Nwanyị a dị ime.
His heart is there.	Obi ya dị n'ebe ahụ.
I told him about the two families.	Agwara m ya banyere ezinụlọ abụọ ahụ.
He was one of two men and one woman.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ụmụ nwoke abụọ na otu nwanyị.
She’s just trying to help.	Ọ na-agbalị naanị inye aka.
Only, not.	Naanị, agaghị.
But then the time comes.	Ma mgbe ahụ, oge na-abịa.
But it is not his place to say so.	Ma ọ bụghị ebe ya ikwu otú ahụ.
But it was not the most important thing in my life.	Ma ọ bụghị ihe kacha m mkpa ná ndụ.
Who he is looking for.	Onye ọ na-achọ.
I want that now.	Achọrọ m nke ahụ ugbu a.
But not for long.	Ma ọ bụghị ogologo oge.
They are never fun.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha na-atọ ụtọ.
But he left.	Ma o si ebe ahụ pụọ.
That you may be told over and over again.	Ka e wee gwa gị ugboro ugboro.
None of them are going now.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ha na-aga ugbu a.
I do not know what this is about.	Amaghị ihe nke a gbasara.
Most of the people are unemployed.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị ahụ enweghị ọrụ.
It’s good that the company’s idea is spread.	Ọ dị mma na echiche ụlọ ọrụ gbasara.
I can't see it, anyway.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ya, n'agbanyeghị.
Arrive on time for work.	O rutere n'oge maka ọrụ.
Whatever it is, you are trying to bring it to life.	Ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ, ị na-agbalị ime ka ọ dị ndụ.
He started a coffee machine.	Ọ malitere igwe kọfị kọfị.
He always knew about the third person.	Ọ maara mgbe niile banyere onye nke atọ.
You probably do not know how useful it is.	Ma eleghị anya, amaghị otú ọ bara uru.
As it will.	Dị ka ọ ga-eme.
The cold is not good.	Oyi adịghị mma.
Sometimes this does not work.	Mgbe ụfọdụ nke a anaghị arụ ọrụ.
This should be the case.	Otu a ka o kwesịrị ịdị.
Wear clothes that you do not like.	Yiri uwe na-adịghị amasị gị.
We will do a movie once.	Anyị ga-eme ihe nkiri otu ugboro.
He’s an apathetic, machine.	Ọ bụ onye enweghị mmasị, igwe.
Not in life.	Ọ bụghị na ndụ.
The book itself was on fire.	Akwụkwọ ahụ n'onwe ya gbara ọkụ.
Each of them has a situation.	Onye ọ bụla n'ime ha nwere ọnọdụ.
Sometimes they are not.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha adịghị.
How he loved her.	Otú o si hụ ya n’anya.
These are my last words.	Ndị a bụ okwu ikpeazụ m.
I will not use anything else.	Agaghị m eji ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
For him, and for me.	Maka ya, na maka m.
The first two are obvious.	Abụọ mbụ n'ime ha doro anya.
But of course by the way.	Ma n'ezie n'ụzọ.
I had enough money to get it that month.	Enwere m ego zuru oke iji nweta ya n'ọnwa ahụ.
But sometimes it does.	Ma mgbe ụfọdụ ọ na-eme.
For any occasion you have to go by cheap car.	Maka isi ihe ọ bụla ị ga-aga ụgbọ ala dị ọnụ ala.
Officials can rest if necessary.	Ndị isi nwere ike izu ike ma ọ dị mkpa.
Good book.	Ezigbo akwụkwọ.
For example, no one wants to do laundry by hand.	Dị ka ihe atụ, ọ dịghị onye chọrọ iji aka na-asụ uwe.
We had a wonderful time.	Anyị nwere oge dị egwu.
This year, next year, or age-wise.	N'afọ a, n'afọ ọzọ, ma ọ bụ onye maara afọ.
It's the only way.	Ọ bụ naanị ụzọ.
For one thing, the group will not allow us to do that.	Otu ihe bụ na ndị otu agaghị ekwe ka anyị mee.
None of us said a word.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị kwuru otu okwu.
But not a mirror.	Ma ọ bụghị enyo.
It is difficult for them to come.	O siri ike ka ha na-abịa.
But everyone has a different situation and approach.	Mana onye ọ bụla nwere ọnọdụ na ụzọ dị iche iche.
I said.	M kwuru.
But we will not tell you now.	Mana anyị agaghị agwa gị ya ugbu a.
We only work at night.	Anyị na-arụ ọrụ naanị abalị.
It is not recommended.	Ọ naghị atụ aro.
But it does have two functions.	Mana ọ na-arụ ọrụ abụọ.
This book sounds like a great idea.	Akwụkwọ a dị ka nnukwu echiche.
He is unparalleled in stature for his age.	Ọ dị ogologo na-enweghị atụ maka afọ ndụ ya.
He nodded.	O kwere isi.
They will help you, he said.	Ha ga-enyere gị aka, o kwuru.
He does what he wants to do.	Ọ na-eme ihe ọ chọrọ ime.
We do not like the idea.	Echiche ahụ adịghị anyị mma.
Their mother was right.	Nne ha kwuru eziokwu.
It's like suffering.	Ọ dị ka ahụhụ.
Loved every minute of it.	Hụrụ n'anya kwa nkeji ya.
Many of the members are now free.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị otu ahụ nwere onwe ha ugbu a.
We need to seize that opportunity.	Anyị kwesịrị ime ka ohere ahụ dị.
But you are right.	Mana i kwuru eziokwu.
That time was fun.	Oge ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
No, he can't.	Ọ gaghị, ọ nweghị ike.
Maybe that's why nothing happened.	O nwere ike ịbụ ya mere o nweghị ihe merenụ.
She is a good girl.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwa agbọghọ.
I speak for the other.	M na-ekwu maka nke ọzọ.
Let me give you one meal.	Ka m nye gị nri otu nri.
It is a machine.	Ọ bụ igwe.
That is different.	Nke dị iche.
One last test.	Otu ule ikpeazụ.
Many did.	Ọtụtụ ndị mere ya.
Their situation is dire.	Ọnọdụ ha siri ike.
Anyone can use that.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ike iji nke ahụ.
Every word about it is true.	Okwu ọ bụla banyere ya bụ eziokwu.
Of course, this is true.	N'ezie, nke a bụ eziokwu.
It is winter.	Ọ bụ oge oyi.
But it is still useful.	Ma ọ ka bara uru.
We have a small staff, work and hours at this time.	Anyị nwere obere ndị ọrụ, ọrụ na awa n'oge a.
For a while.	Ruo oge ụfọdụ.
We can not be far away.	Anyị enweghị ike ịnọ ebe dị anya.
The company offered a number of benefits.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ nyere ọtụtụ uru.
Really nice eyes.	Ezigbo anya n'ezie.
Names are just one word.	Aha bụ naanị otu okwu.
The problem, however, is that of power.	Otú ọ dị, nsogbu bụ nke ike.
But you are there.	Ma ị nọ ebe ahụ.
One can not do the other.	Otu enweghị ike ime nke ọzọ.
So it works.	Ya mere ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
You are moving forward in every way you can.	Ị na-aga n'ihu n'ụzọ ọ bụla ị nwere ike.
I can get them for you.	Enwere m ike ị nweta ha maka gị.
What day is today?	Kedu ụbọchị taa?

He died a few years ago.	Ọ nwụrụ afọ ole na ole gara aga.
I just want to see what happens to them.	Naanị ihe m chọrọ bụ ịhụ ihe mere ha.
I'll talk to the man soon.	Aga m agwa nwoke okwu n'oge na-adịghị anya.
He got angry with himself.	O were onwe ya iwe.
There are some points.	Nwere ụfọdụ nwere isi.
I run.	M na-agba ọsọ.
Great value for a great trip.	Uru dị oke mma maka njem dị mma.
Only one of the two can be used at the same time.	Enwere ike iji naanị otu n'ime ha abụọ n'otu oge.
This place is awesome in the summer.	Ebe a dị egwu n'oge okpomọkụ.
I want to see if it is okay.	Achọrọ m ịhụ na ọ dị mma.
They will be.	Ha ga-abụ.
She wondered if the house she lived in belonged to her.	Ọ nọ na-eche ma ụlọ ọ bi bụ nke ya.
He took his hand.	O were aka ya.
But he can do this.	Ma o nwere ike ime nke a.
Only two of them left.	Naanị mmadụ abụọ n'ime ha hapụrụ.
They were talking.	Ha nọ na-ekwu okwu.
This city is really different.	Obodo a dị iche n'ezie.
One thing is for sure, or it is not.	Otu ihe bụ, ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị.
This is similar to this question, but the model is different.	Nke a yiri ajụjụ a, mana ụdị dị iche.
They cannot see.	Ha apụghị ịhụ ụzọ.
They are very expensive.	Ha mara oke ọnụ.
Men can be different.	Ụmụ nwoke nwere ike ịdị iche.
They will come.	Ha ga-abịa.
It makes him happy.	Ọ na-eme ya obi ụtọ.
Her face is small and beautiful.	Ihu ya dị obere ma mara mma.
I took advantage of the opportunity.	Eji m ohere ahụ mee ihe.
Make the words come alive.	Mee ka okwu ndị ahụ dị ndụ wee bụrụ abụ.
I want to be better than that.	Achọrọ m ịdị mma karịa nke ahụ.
Everyone's the best player!	Onye ọ bụla kacha eme egwuregwu!
It is easy to love.	Ọ dị mfe ịhụ n'anya.
So he began to weep.	Ya mere ọ malitere ibe ákwá.
In this way.	N'ụzọ dị otu a.
I am grateful for his strength and spirit.	Obi dị m ụtọ maka ike na mmụọ ya.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	O kwuru na ọ ga-abụ na o kwuru eziokwu.
The wine is strong on the mouth.	Mmanya ahụ siri ike n'ọnụ ọnụ.
Meals are only for ten days.	Nri dị naanị ụbọchị iri.
There personal life is not our business.	N'ebe ahụ ndụ onwe onye abụghị nke ọrụ anyị.
A patient's age is not the cause.	Afọ nke onye ọrịa abụghị ihe kpatara ya.
So let them be.	Ya mere, ka ha dị.
But it is really giving and using.	Mana ọ bụ n'ezie inye na were.
It was my fault.	Ọ bụ m kpatara ya.
I could not believe that there were people who would do such a thing.	Enweghị m ike ikweta na e nwere ndị ga-eme ụdị ihe a.
My sister and I watched the movie.	Anyị na nwanne m nwanyị lere ihe nkiri ahụ.
The second is physical.	Nke abụọ bụ ihe gbasara ike.
I like them to be honest in every way.	Ọ na-amasị m ka ha na-ekwu eziokwu n'ụzọ ọ bụla.
Everyone is young.	Onye ọ bụla bụ nwata.
Everything is better in the morning.	Ihe niile ka mma n'ụtụtụ.
As he ate, he began to think.	Ka ọ na-eri nri, ọ malitere iche echiche.
Tell it again.	Gwa ya ọzọ.
Her clothes are not comfortable.	Uwe ya adịghị mma.
I am here because it should not be necessary.	Anọ m ebe a n'ihi na o kwesịghị ịdị mkpa.
They will be.	Ha ga-abụ.
The film is good for both men and women.	Ihe nkiri ahụ dị mma maka ụmụ nwoke na uwe.
Their money is good.	Ego ha dị mma.
By everyone.	Site na onye ọ bụla.
I was behind him.	Anọ m n'azụ ya.
The city is on fire.	Obodo na-agba ọkụ.
This is his house.	Nke a bụ ụlọ ya.
The next morning went to the office.	N'ụtụtụ echi gara ụlọ ọrụ.
But no one knows any of this.	Ma ọ dịghị onye maara nke ọ bụla nke a.
This idea is very important.	Echiche a dị oke mkpa.
I'm not happy.	Obi adịghị m ụtọ.
I have my own car.	Enwere m ụgbọ ala nke m.
Some of them are expensive.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ha dị oke ọnụ.
He told her many things.	Ọ gwara ya ọtụtụ ihe.
Water behind.	Mmiri n'azụ.
He was a man, with trees and skins.	Ọ bụ nwoke, nke nwere osisi na akpụkpọ anụ.
Do you want to know my opinion?	Ị chọrọ ịma echiche m?
There are those who like to eat and those who do not.	E nwere ndị na-enwe mmasị iri ihe na ndị na-adịghị.
We live in a hospital.	Anyị bi n'ụlọ ọgwụ.
This is kind of its own.	Otu a bụ ụdị nke ya.
It's a beautiful place.	Ọ bụ ebe mara mma.
I was confident again.	Obi siri m ike ọzọ.
There will be a trial next week.	A ga-enwe ikpe ikpe n'izu na-abịa.
Help here.	Aka ebe a.
I was terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ m.
The name is well known, but he does not know why.	Aha ahụ maara nke ọma, ma ọ maghị ihe kpatara ya.
But they did.	Ma, ha mere.
They know what happened.	Ha ma ihe merenụ.
This man.	Nwoke a .
Two people offered me a job.	Mmadụ abụọ nyere m ọrụ.
He took some of them.	O were ụfọdụ n'ime ha.
It is very beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
He asked a lot of questions.	Ọ jụrụ nnọọ ajụjụ.
Her son is.	Nwa ya nwoke bụ.
The ship is now.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ dị ugbu a.
Maybe we do or maybe we don’t.	Ma eleghị anya, anyị na-eme ma eleghị anya anyị adịghị.
See this story of suffering.	Hụ akụkọ ahụhụ a.
It will not be bad.	Ọ gaghị adị njọ.
So we don't have much to work with.	Ya mere, anyị enweghị ọtụtụ ihe anyị ga-eji na-arụ ọrụ.
He really liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
But it certainly did.	Ma n'ezie ọ tụrụ ya ụjọ.
Maybe some of them.	Ma eleghị anya, ụfọdụ n'ime ha abụọ.
So friendly with everyone.	Ya mere enyi na enyi na onye ọ bụla.
They are very good at their work.	Ha dị oke mma na ọrụ ha.
As will happen next week.	Dị ka ọ ga-eme n'izu na-abịa.
Then he just wanted to stay home.	Mgbe ahụ ọ chọrọ naanị ịnọ n'ụlọ.
This, of course, is a well-known effect.	Nke a, n'ezie, bụ mmetụta a maara nke ọma.
The weather and food are perfect.	Ihu igwe na nri zuru oke.
It's a beautiful idea.	Ọ bụ echiche mara mma.
I can see what is expected of me.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ihe a tụrụ anya n'aka m.
Stories about human disease.	Akụkọ ndị na-ekwu maka ọrịa mmadụ.
It's a thing.	Ọ bụ ihe.
The tough guy said he was right.	Nwa nwoke ahụ siri ike siri na o kwuru eziokwu.
Nobody likes to be around people.	Ọ dịghị onye na-enwe mmasị ịnọ n'ebe ndị mmadụ nọ n'aka.
Around and around we went.	Gburugburu na gburugburu anyị gara.
He is doing what he pleases now.	Ọ na-eme ihe masịrị ya ugbu a.
Not many people know me.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ndị maara m.
Most for clothing.	Ọtụtụ n'ihi na uwe.
In the city most probably.	Na obodo kacha eleghị anya.
Where are we going?	Ebee ka anyị ga-aga.
At work.	Na ọrụ.
He is a powerful speaker.	Ọ bụ onye na-ekwu okwu dị ike.
Everything is possible.	Ihe niile kwere omume.
Obviously not.	N'ụzọ doro anya, ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
I saw a lot of unique things.	Ahụrụ ọtụtụ ihe pụrụ iche.
I would like to have a longer stay.	Ọ ga-amasị m inwe ogologo oge.
It's a big job.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ọrụ.
He can give himself time.	O nwere ike inye onwe ya oge.
We have two problems.	Anyị nwere nsogbu abụọ.
Very strong.	Dị nnọọ ike.
Maybe it did.	Ma eleghị anya, o mere n'ezie.
Here is a second example.	Nke a bụ ihe atụ nke abụọ.
Not flesh.	Ọ bụghị anụ ahụ.
We have it down.	Anyị nwere ya ala.
Maybe it's okay.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị mma.
He wants me to stay.	Ọ chọrọ ka m nọrọ ya.
As a result, they gained a beautiful reputation.	N'ihi ya, ha nwetara aha mara mma.
Without staff.	Na-enweghị ndị ọrụ.
But not so with you.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka ọ dị gị.
That is what it should be.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe o kwesịrị ịbụ.
It's not fair.	Ọ dịghị mma.
It’s a great movie.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ihe nkiri.
Their home is on a beautiful beach.	Ụlọ ha dị n'akụkụ osimiri mara mma.
No one wants it anymore.	Ọ dịghị onye chọrọ ya ọzọ.
We would like them to have that.	Anyị ga-achọ ka ha nweta nke ahụ.
I don’t want him to know this.	Achọghị m ka ọ mara nke a.
His house burned down one night.	Ụlọ ya gbara ọkụ n'otu abalị.
The materials were made of wood.	E ji osisi mee ihe ndị ahụ.
A colleague knows.	Onye ọrụ ibe ya na-ama.
He wants to get out.	Ọ chọrọ ịpụ.
People expect the same thing.	Ndị mmadụ na-atụ anya otu ihe ahụ.
I know he's bad.	Ama m na ọ bụ onye ọjọọ.
Very well.	Ọ dị mma nke ukwuu.
Now here are some of them.	Ugbu a ọ bụ ụfọdụ n'ime ha.
It’s not a plan or a plan.	Ọ bụghị atụmatụ ma ọ bụ atụmatụ.
We think we are in a good position to do this.	Anyị chere na anyị nọ na nke a nke ọma.
He did not know.	Ọ maghị.
Very good.	Ọ dị ezigbo mma.
We only have different strengths and weaknesses.	Anyị nwere naanị ike na adịghị ike dị iche iche.
I'm very different.	Ọ dị m nnọọ iche.
She could not cry.	O nweghị ike ibe ákwá.
Or in front of him.	Ma ọ bụ n'ihu ya.
As you know, there are others.	Dị ka ị maara, e nwere ndị ọzọ.
I see that you really liked it.	Ahụrụ m na ọ masịrị gị nke ukwuu.
That is the problem.	Ihe ahụ bụ nsogbu.
It does not work for some things.	Ọ naghị arụ ọrụ maka ihe ụfọdụ.
I can be.	Enwere m ike ịbụ.
There may be many of them.	Enwere ike ịdị ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
He had a few problems at the time.	O nwere nsogbu ole na ole n'oge ahụ.
Good job on this !.	Arụ ọrụ dị mma na nke a!.
Someone put some drinks in it.	Mmadụ tinyere ihe ọṅụṅụ na ya.
Again you will not know how long they will last.	Ọzọ ị gaghị ama ogologo oge ha ga-adị.
I told him only yesterday.	M gwara ya naanị ụnyaahụ.
He does not like it.	Ọ naghị amasị ya.
It's beautiful, of course.	Ọ mara mma, n'ezie.
I never gave myself a chance.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m nyere onwe m ohere.
I have a lot of questions.	Enwere m ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
There are no basic foods.	O nweghị ihe ndị bụ́ isi e ji rie nri ọ bụla.
No one understood.	Ọ dịghị onye ghọtara.
Then we have the right law.	Mgbe ahụ, anyị nwere ezi iwu.
The question is why this could be.	Ajụjụ bụ ihe kpatara nke a nwere ike ịbụ.
This year is the first year.	Afọ a bụ afọ mbụ.
That would be bad.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ihe ọjọọ.
Most people are not ready.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ adịghị njikere.
We have our own plans and plans.	Anyị nwere atụmatụ na atụmatụ nke anyị.
There is no point in doing that.	O nweghị uru ime nke ahụ.
It is a form of suffering.	Ọ bụ ụdị ahụhụ.
It's worse now.	Ọ ka njọ ugbu a.
He bought himself a new coat.	Ọ zụtara onwe ya uwe ọhụrụ.
That sounds like a serious problem.	Nke ahụ dị ka nsogbu siri ike.
One idea suggested another.	Otu echiche tụrụ aro ọzọ.
This is fine.	Nke a bụ nke ọma.
You can see this trip is nothing but a problem.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ njem a abụghị ihe ọ bụla ma ọ bụghị nsogbu.
Let it be well then.	Ka ọ dị mma n'oge ahụ.
Things don't work out for me.	Ihe anaghị arụ ọrụ maka m.

I left at three.	M hapụrụ na atọ.
My father wanted me to leave.	Nna m chọrọ ka m pụọ.
So what happens.	Ya mere, ihe na-eme.
No one will go second.	Ọ dịghị onye ga-aga nke abụọ.
There should be many others like them.	Ekwesịrị inwe ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ dị ka ha.
We don't do this just because we think it's a good idea.	Anyị anaghị eme nke a naanị n'ihi na anyị chere na ọ bụ echiche mara mma.
She and my brother came to a party.	Ya na nwanne m nwoke bịara oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
The man will move on to something.	Nwoke ga-aga n'ihu na ihe.

There was only one girl with him.	Ọ bụ naanị otu nwa agbọghọ ya na ya nọ.

This can be seen everywhere.	Enwere ike ịhụ nke a ebe niile.
I don't like this policeman.	Onye uwe ojii a ahụghị m n'anya.
But he does it.	Ma ọ na-eme ya.
All is well.	Ihe niile dị mma.
She could do nothing.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ pụrụ ime.
But that is not an idea.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị echiche.
The people arrived, not the water.	Ndị ahụ rutere, ọ bụghị mmiri mmiri.
His wife may be his friend.	Nwunye ya nwere ike ịbụ enyi ya.
Good on you.	Ezigbo gị.
He understood that I was scared.	Ọ ghọtara na ụjọ tụrụ m.
That is not the point I am making.	Nke ahụ abụghị isi ihe m na-ekwu.
Thanks, my friends.	Daalụ, ndị enyi m.
I do not know why.	Amaghị m ihe kpatara nke a.
He is my best friend.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi m.
The river is well known for its freshwater water.	A maara osimiri ahụ nke ọma maka mmiri mmiri.
He likes to do certain things, but not so much.	Ọ na-enwe mmasị ime ihe ụfọdụ, ma ọ bụghị nke ukwuu.
I love their style.	Ahụrụ m ụdị ha n'anya.
I'm sorry, man.	Ọ dị m nwute, nwoke.
It is the uniqueness of your home.	Ọ bụ ihe pụrụ iche nke ụlọ gị.
Go your own way to be friends.	Gaa n'ụzọ gị inwe enyi.
But he hates me.	Ma ọ kpọrọ m asị.
He checked his phone.	Ọ lere ekwentị ya.
Do their best.	Na-eme ike ha niile.
Is that what you are saying? 	Nke ahụ ọ bụ ihe ị na-ekwu?
The man's face lit up with anger.	Ihu nwoke ahụ were iwe dị ọkụ.
his mother asked me.	nne ya jụrụ m.
Others, let's do something.	Ndị ọzọ, ka anyị mee ihe n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
It is the same for us.	Ọ bụ otu ihe ahụ nye anyị.
No one can make me do them.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ime ka m mee ha.
It is for him.	Ọ bụ maka ya.
The man looked up.	Nwoke ahụ lere anya.
I will not let them.	Agaghị m ekwe ka ha.
I feel like crying for her.	Ọ dị m ka ibe ákwá maka ya.
It is bad or not, let's see it.	Ọ dị njọ ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị, ka anyị hụ ya.
One idea! 	Otu echiche!
It is cold.	Ọ jụrụ oyi.
he says.	ọ na-ekwu.
Or it may not be more.	Ma ọ bụ o nwere ike ọ gaghị enwe karịa.
Can we get our point ?.	Anyị nwere ike nweta isi ihe anyị?.
He told me everything.	Ọ gwara m ihe niile.
He told her that what she had done was wrong.	Ọ gwara ya na ihe o mere adịghị mma.
He looked around.	O lere anya gburugburu.
He failed the driving test three times.	Ọ dara ule ịnya ụgbọ ala ugboro atọ.
Or at least, not in it.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, ọ bụghị na ya.
It would have been a small thing.	Ọ gaara abụ obere ihe.
They think you will never know.	Ha chere na ị gaghị ama.
I am more busy.	Enwere m ọrụ n'aka karịa.
Then he sat down again.	O wee nọdụ ala ọzọ.
It works great.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ukwuu.
Sometimes without arms or legs.	Mgbe ụfọdụ na-enweghị aka ma ọ bụ ụkwụ.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
The reason is that only a person has a language.	Ihe kpatara na ọ bụ naanị mmadụ nwere asụsụ.
He refused to give his name.	Ọ jụrụ ịkpọ aha ya.
His father, one.	Nna ya, otu.
The situation, however, is very different.	Otú ọ dị, ọnọdụ maka ikpe dị egwu dị nnọọ iche.
We had a good time.	Anyị nwere oge dị mma.
Everything yourself.	Ihe niile n'onwe gị.
But she left her bag in my room.	Ma ọ hapụrụ akpa ya n'ọnụ ụlọ m.
It was once.	Ọ bụ otu mgbe.
No singing.	Enweghị abụ.
Not like some others here, because.	Ọ bụghị dị ka ụfọdụ ndị ọzọ ebe a, n'ihi na.
Great bed.	Ebe akwa akwa.
It's not easy.	Ọ naghị adị mfe.
Water is his life.	Mmiri bụ ndụ ya.
Should do what you want.	Kwesịrị ime ihe ị na-achọ.
That’s not the kind of place for people like us.	Nke ahụ abụghị ụdị ebe ọ bụla maka ndị dị ka anyị.
Violence or violence.	Ike ma ọ bụ ime ihe ike.
But how do they do that?	Ma olee otú ha si eme nke ahụ.
They started talking.	Ha malitere ikwu okwu.
No game happened.	Ọ dịghị egwuregwu mere.
How does this work?	Kedu ka ihe a si arụ ọrụ?
If this continues and I think it will happen.	Ọ bụrụ na nke a na-aga n'ihu ma echere m na ọ ga-eme.
They do not know how this can happen.	Ha amaghị otú nke a pụrụ isi mee.
Many of them are his relatives.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha bụ ndị ikwu ya.
Everyone knows who he is.	Mmadụ niile ma onye ọ bụ.
No child.	Enweghị nwa.
Such people need only one or two.	Ndị dị otú ahụ, ha chọrọ naanị otu ma ọ bụ abụọ.
That will not work this time.	Nke ahụ agaghị arụ ọrụ oge a.
They want information about the case.	Ha chọrọ ozi gbasara ikpe ahụ.
Everyone on the water.	Onye ọ bụla na mmiri.
You may not know that, but you do understand.	O nwere ike ị gaghị ama nke ahụ, mana ị ghọtara ya.
No, there are no plans.	Mba, enweghị atụmatụ.
Please can you help me with that.	Biko ị nwere ike nyere m aka na nke ahụ.
Do as you are told.	Mee ihe dị ka a gwara gị.
And he went out.	O wee pụọ.
These things are not our job.	Emeghị ihe ndị a ọrụ anyị.
It can be anything really.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọ bụla n'ezie.
I had time for them once.	Enwere m oge maka ha otu ugboro.
Tell me about your family.	Gwa m gbasara ezinụlọ gị.
It may not be the first time.	O nwere ike ịbụ na ọ bụghị mbụ.
Everyone should do that.	Onye ọ bụla kwesịrị ime nke ahụ.
But not for lack of space.	Ma ọ bụghị maka enweghị ohere.
Of course it did.	N'ezie o mere.
Whatever happens, everyone knows about it.	Ihe ọ bụla na-eme, onye ọ bụla maara banyere ya.
I like that about you.	Ọ masịrị m nke ahụ gbasara gị.
Some did.	Ụfọdụ mere ya.
He told me he was a student.	Ọ gwara m na ya bụ nwa akwụkwọ.
That is the important thing here.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe dị mkpa ebe a.
So thank you to all three.	Ya mere daalụ atọ ndị ahụ.
We want it to be fast and easy.	Anyị chọrọ ka ọ dị ngwa ngwa na mfe.
Here is the key.	A bụ isi.
Not by itself.	Ọ bụghị n'onwe ya.
The accident left the children playing.	Ihe mberede a mere ka ụmụaka ahụ na-egwu egwu.
I don't feel well for that.	Ọ naghị adị m mma maka nke ahụ.
Which is different than you might think.	Kedu nke dị iche karịa ka ị nwere ike iche.
No, not children.	Mba, ọ bụghị ụmụaka.
There is no way he can travel now.	O nweghị otú ọ ga-esi mee njem ugbu a.
One and different.	Otu ma dị iche.
He was surrounded by a large body.	Nnukwu ahụ́ gbara ya gburugburu.
Each group has different ways of doing it.	Otu ọ bụla nwere ụzọ dị iche iche isi mee ya.
Three simple words can improve your life.	Okwu atọ dị mfe nwere ike ime ka ndụ gị ka mma.
Of course this is my opinion.	N'ezie nke a bụ echiche m.
I hope he does.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ ga-eme ya.
I can't stay.	Enweghị m ike ịnọ.
School started within three weeks.	Ụlọ akwụkwọ malitere n'ime izu atọ.
He does not eat.	Ọ naghị eri nri.
It’s all different.	Ọ bụ ụdị dị iche iche.
It simply is not possible.	Naanị ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
We are in a place of importance.	Anyị nọ n'ebe dị mkpa.

The restaurant is not good.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ adịghị mma.
They’re good, but it doesn’t matter.	Ha dị mma, ma ọ dịghị mkpa.
But it does not do what you want it to do.	Mana ọ naghị eme ihe ịchọrọ na nke a.
He told me that no one was interested.	Ọ gwara m na o nweghị onye nwere mmasị.
But you are.	Ma ị nọ.
They want him to leave.	Ha chọrọ ka ọ pụọ ebe ahụ.
We need to move on.	Anyị kwesịrị ịga n'ihu.
He tells us his situation clearly and clearly	Ọ gwara anyị ọnọdụ ya n'ụzọ doro anya na nke ọma
This is very important to us.	Nke a dị anyị ezigbo mkpa.
It’s a different matter.	Ọ bụ ihe dị iche.
He entered into a group and stopped.	Ọ banyere n'ime otu wee kwụsị.
We are in this together.	Anyị nọ na nke a ọnụ.
There is no large room inside.	Enweghị nnukwu ọnụ ụlọ n'ime.
The cold effect does not work.	Mmetụta jụrụ oyi anaghị arụ ọrụ.
I care about people.	M na-eche banyere ndị mmadụ.
Let me know if you have any questions.	Mee ka m mara ma ị nwere ajụjụ ọ bụla.
Up to one point.	Ruo otu isi.
We know what one looks like.	Anyị maara otú otu dị.
I knew him then.	Amaara m ya mgbe ahụ.
She is reading.	Ọ na-agụ akwụkwọ.
But as you said, it could be the last three games.	Mana dị ka i kwuru, ọ nwere ike ịbụ egwuregwu atọ ikpeazụ.
You do a great job here.	Ị na-arụ nnukwu ọrụ ebe a.
Most of it bad.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ya ọjọọ.
Of course, the only key to living truth.	N'ezie, naanị isi ihe dị ndụ eziokwu.
I am grateful for it.	Obi dị m ụtọ maka ya.
I just can't help it.	M nnọọ enweghị ike inyere ya.
No, of course not.	Mba, n'ezie anyị anaghị eme ya.
Dead, probably not.	Nwụrụ anwụ, eleghị anya ọ bụghị.
Getting healthy is a challenge.	Inwe ahụ dị mma bụ ihe ịma aka.
But this is not the case.	Ma nke a abụghị otú ahụ.
Very handsome man.	Nwoke mara mma nke ukwuu.
You know what a lot of clinical trials are.	Ị maara ihe ọtụtụ ule ụlọ ọgwụ bụ.
That could be.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ.
This city has a great history.	Obodo a nwere nnukwu akụkọ ihe mere eme.
I did not understand immediately.	Aghọtaghị m ozugbo.
It does not make us happy.	Ọ naghị eme anyị obi ụtọ.
He never told me about this.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ gwara m banyere nke a.
I am three years old.	Adị m afọ atọ.
Only two staff attended this school.	Naanị ndị ọrụ abụọ gara ụlọ akwụkwọ a.
Nothing like this happened next to me.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ mere n'akụkụ m.
Of course, there is something better than anything.	N'ezie, ọ dị ihe ka ihe ọ bụla mma.
I work full time.	Ana m arụ ọrụ oge niile.
But they are beautiful in their own right.	Ma ha mara mma n’ihe ha mere.
You are the people.	Ị bụ ndị mmadụ.
He thought the idea was important.	Ọ dị ya ka echiche dị mkpa.
This is a great case.	Nke a bụ oke ikpe.
Then, again, and again.	Mgbe ahụ, ọzọ, na ọzọ.
Then everyone saw the missionaries.	Mgbe ahụ, onye ọ bụla hụrụ ndị ozi ala ọzọ ahụ.
Like my mother.	Dị ka ọ dị nne m.
Get it right.	Nweta ya nke ọma.
But you frighten me.	Ma ị na-atụ m ụjọ.

How they act.	Otú ha si eme omume.
He is glad he did.	Obi dị ya ụtọ na o mere ya.
Fire and many more.	Ọkụ na ọtụtụ ya.
The second question.	Ajụjụ nke abụọ ya.
He looked her up and down.	O lere ya anya elu na ala.
People know here.	Ndị mmadụ maara ebe a.
He gave his reporter his newspaper.	O nyere onye nta akụkọ akwụkwọ akụkọ akụkọ ya.
Other fun places.	Ebe ndị ọzọ na-atọ ụtọ.
That is what they want us to do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ha chọrọ ka anyị mee.
They make me worse, man.	Ha na-eme m ka njọ, nwoke.
We loved him right away.	Anyị hụrụ ya n'anya ozugbo.
It’s fun, of course, but nothing major.	Ọ bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ, n'ezie, mana ọ nweghị nnukwu ihe.
To feel.	Ka inwe mmetụta.
He’s a tough guy, he’ll be like.	Ọ bụ nwoke siri ike, ọ ga-adị ka.
So be prepared.	Ya mere, adịghị njikere.
They asked each other questions.	Ha jụrụ ibe ha ajụjụ.
But that was last week.	Ma nke ahụ bụ izu gara aga.
They should know.	Ha kwesịrị ịma.
You cannot be happy just being a wife and a mother.	Ị gaghị enwe obi ụtọ naanị ịbụ nwunye na nne.
It is happening now.	Ọ na-eme ugbu a.
Here are some books.	Nke a bụ ụfọdụ akwụkwọ.

Obviously behind us.	O doro anya na n'azụ anyị.
This is not your child.	Nke a abụghị nwa gị.
He goes to his office every day.	Ọ na-aga ụlọ ọrụ ya kwa ụbọchị.
None of those ideas have water.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime echiche ndị ahụ nwere mmiri.
They will look for you.	Ha ga-achọ gị.
That is.	Nke ahụ bụ .
It works the other way around.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọzọ.
I care about my players.	M na-eche banyere ndị egwuregwu m.
They ran for their lives.	Ha gbara ọsọ maka ndụ ha.
Now, let's see if you can do this.	Ugbu a, ka anyị hụ ma ị nwere ike ime nke a.
In most cases, there is no problem.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, nsogbu adịghị.
For a time, it may not be for the money.	Maka otu oge, ọ nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ maka ego ahụ.
That's the way it is.	Ọ bụ otú ọ dị.
He said it was him.	O kwuru na ọ bụ ya.
I need some help.	Achọrọ m enyemaka ụfọdụ.
We seem to be doing well so far.	Ọ dị ka anyị na-eme nke ọma ruo ugbu a.
That alone is fun.	Naanị nke ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
There is no way to know.	Ọ dịghị ụzọ mara.
They called the police.	Ha kpọrọ ndị uwe ojii.
Thoughts, thoughts and ideas.	Uche, echiche na echiche.
He left you.	Ọ hapụrụ gị.
In you.	N'ime gị.
I'm not here for it.	Anọghị m ebe a maka ya.
What makes it inactive is the colorless liquid.	Ihe na-eme ka ọ ghara ịdị na-eme ihe bụ mmiri mmiri na-enweghị agba.
I don't like my beautiful clothes.	Enweghị m mmasị maka uwe m mara mma.
They need a place.	Ha chọrọ ebe.
But of course.	Ma n'ezie.
None of that matters.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ dị mkpa.
Here he got everything he needed.	N'ebe a, o nwetara ihe niile ọ chọrọ.
Some people do not want to do it.	Ụfọdụ ndị achọghị ime ya.
Music can do that.	Egwu nwere ike ime nke ahụ.
It's too sweet.	Ọ dị ụtọ nke ukwuu.
You have only one life.	Ị nwere naanị otu ndụ.
He said a lot.	O kwuru nke ukwuu.

He was surprised that she was surprised.	O juru ya anya na o juru ya anya.

The fact is that this is a well-known fact.	Eziokwu ahụ bụ na nke a bụ ihe a maara nke ọma.

That's when things got out of hand.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka ihe si n'aka.

Anything is possible there.	Ihe ọ bụla kwere omume n'ebe ahụ.

Here, a view of his house.	Ebe a, a echiche nke ụlọ ya.
There is only one problem.	Enwere naanị otu nsogbu.
The team has a role to play.	Ndị otu ahụ nwere oke n'ọrụ ha.
It would be a good fight.	Ọ ga-abụ ọgụ dị mma.
It seemed like a lot of us had gone one day early in the morning.	Ọ dị ka ọtụtụ n'ime anyị gara otu ụbọchị n'isi ụtụtụ.
It was not just his heart.	Ọ bụghị naanị obi ya.
They left the company.	Ha hapụrụ ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
But that is not the life he wants anymore.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị ndụ ọ chọrọ ọzọ.
The condition is very important for the doctor.	Ọnọdụ ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa maka dọkịta.
I want to have a little look there.	Achọrọ m inwe ntakịrị anya ebe ahụ.
This states that there is no other case.	Nke a na-ekwu na ọ dịghị ọzọ ikpe.
She ate the food, but she was not well.	O riri nri ahụ, ma ahụ́ adịghị ya.
It is almost a person's birthday.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ụbọchị ọmụmụ mmadụ.
That was three weeks ago.	Nke ahụ bụ izu atọ gara aga.
Their work was only a small success.	Ọrụ ha nwetara naanị obere ihe ịga nke ọma.
I was there to be the third.	Anọ m ebe ahụ ka m bụrụ onye nke atọ.
This is awesome because it is the first of three.	Nke a dị egwu n'ihi na ọ bụ nke mbụ n'ime atọ.
Such things are needed.	Achọrọ ihe ndị dị otú ahụ.
They just do not know.	Ha amaghị nnọọ.
Who we are looking for.	Onye anyị na-achọ.
Strong words.	Okwu siri ike.
This is what it looks like.	Nke a bụ ihe o yiri.
He is not a man.	Ọ bụghị nwoke.
Many felt differently.	Ọtụtụ nwetara mmetụta dị iche iche.
This kind of story is like real life.	Ụdị akụkọ dị ka ndụ n'ezie.
I am healthy.	Ọ dị m mma maka ahụ ike m.
I am on my way.	Anọ m n'ụzọ.
Good life, as they say.	Ezi ndụ, dị ka ha na-ekwu.
She hopes her children understand.	Ọ tụrụ anya na ụmụ ya ghọtara.
He wonders if the water he is running on his own.	Ọ na-eche ma mmiri ọ na-agba ya n'onwe ya.
He left now.	Ọ hapụrụ ya ugbu a.
That doesn't love me.	Nke ahụ ahụghị m n'anya.
Child.	Nwa.
I found myself happy.	Ahụrụ m onwe m ụtọ.
He does not play games.	Ọ naghị egwu egwuregwu.
Let it be there and feel.	Ka ọ dị ebe ahụ ma nwee mmetụta.
Of course it is best that they should be.	N'ezie ọ kacha mma na ha kwesịrị ịbụ.
You have two problems.	Ị nwere nsogbu abụọ.
I'm glad it's you, not me.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ọ bụ gị, ọ bụghị m.
It is almost impossible.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
She did not understand.	Aghọtaghị ya.
Otherwise, he is simply talking.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ na-ekwu nnọọ okwu.
Be as healthy as other men.	Nwee ahụ ike dị ka ụmụ nwoke ndị ọzọ.
They are all you need.	Ha bụ ihe niile ị na-achọ.
That ended the small problem.	Nke ahụ kwụsịrị obere nsogbu ahụ.
Why do they eat so much?	Gịnị mere ha na-eri nke ukwuu?
What happens is the flesh does not want it there again.	Ihe na-eme bụ anụ ahụ achọghị ya ebe ahụ ọzọ.
Still they are like it.	N'agbanyeghị ha dị ka ya.
It is very close.	Ọ dị ezigbo nso.
I invited him over for dinner.	M kpọrọ ya ka ọ bịa rie nri abalị.
My life story.	Akụkọ ndụ m.
This school has a good reputation.	Ụlọ akwụkwọ a nwere aha ọma.
A group of students came.	Otu ụmụ akwụkwọ bịara.
But my problem is this.	Mana nsogbu m bụ nke a.
There are more of those than ever before.	Enwere ọtụtụ n'ime ndị ahụ karịa mgbe ọ bụla ọzọ.
Those feelings should have little effect.	Mmetụta ndị ahụ kwesịrị inwe mmetụta dị nta.
We have a lot of work ahead of us, staff.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ ọrụ n'ihu anyị, ndị ọrụ.
Many questions were asked.	A jụrụ ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
But we are looking for.	Ma anyị na-achọ.
She wants to know where her son is.	Ọ chọrọ ịma ebe nwa ya nọ.
It reads fast.	Ọ na-agụ ngwa ngwa.
The children will go to school.	Ụmụaka ga-aga akwụkwọ.
I know two of them a little.	Amaara m abụọ n'ime ha ntakịrị.
He looked at his work for a while.	O lere ọrụ ya anya nwa oge.
He wanted to have a break.	Ọ dị ya ka o nwee ezumike.
Do this for a week.	Mee nke a otu izu.
Now you can say.	Ugbu a ị nwere ike ikwu.
Tears welled up in his eyes.	Anya mmiri gbara ya n'ihu.
For some time, nothing was said.	Ruo oge ụfọdụ, ọ dịghị ihe e kwuru.
Good long sleep, that’s what you need.	Ezigbo ụra ogologo, nke ahụ bụ ihe ị chọrọ.
He liked it, he knew that.	Ọ masịrị ya, ọ maara nke ahụ.
He tried to think of something else.	Ọ gbalịrị iche echiche banyere ihe ọzọ.
Maybe there is still someone.	Ma eleghị anya, a ka nwere onye.
Many were terrified.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha tụrụ egwu.
She was shocked to find that it had happened to her.	O juru ya anya ịhụ na ihe ahụ mere ya n’anya.
She is a good girl.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwa agbọghọ.
There is only one application ahead, of course.	Enwere naanị otu ngwa n'ihu, n'ezie.
Maybe it is.	Ma eleghị anya ọ bụ.
That is one of the main concerns of the authorities.	Nke ahụ bụ otu n'ime ihe ndị isi na-eche.
Do the work, do the work.	Mee ọrụ ahụ, mee ihe.
I have so much to do.	Enwere m ọtụtụ ihe m ga-eme.
I can see this happening.	Enwere m ike ịhụ nke a na-eme.
I'm pretty sure.	Eji m n'aka nke ukwuu.
It seems to be about my age or older.	O yiri ka ọ̀ bụ ihe gbasara afọ m ma ọ bụ karịa.
Now the city faces a number of challenges.	Ugbu a, obodo ahụ na-eche ọtụtụ ihe ịma aka ihu.
That is very cruel.	Nke ahụ bụ oke obi ọjọọ.
The city has a large old building.	Obodo ahụ nwere nnukwu ụlọ ochie.
It’s fun to see how fast you can do it.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ ịhụ ka ị nwere ike ime ngwa ngwa.

Tell me why.	Gwa m ihe kpatara ya.

Eye to eye.	Anya na anya.
They looked closer.	Ha lere anya nso.
This will be my job.	Nke a ga-abụ ọrụ m.
But know him well.	Ma mara ya nke ọma.
His laughter was awesome.	Ọchị ya bụ egwu.

The head of a state is a man.	Onye isi ala bụ mmadụ.
I tried to stop them.	M gbalịrị ime ka ha kwụsị.
He can cook solid foods.	O nwere ike isi nri ndị siri ike.
It is useful.	Ọ bara uru.
I would like to see that.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịhụ nke ahụ.
Because you are valuable.	N'ihi na ị bara uru.
This may be the first of its kind.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ nke mbụ ụdị ya.
No matter what he said.	N'agbanyeghị ihe o kwuru.
He had time, and a lot of it.	O nwere oge, na ọtụtụ ya.
That's not yours.	Nke ahụ abụghị nke gị.
She met her husband when he was a child.	Ọ zutere di ya mgbe ọ bụ nwata.
Many others in this town have cell phones.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ n'ime obodo a nwere ekwentị.
Hard night.	Abalị siri ike.
Is that not scary, chief?	Nke ahụ ọ́ bụghị egwu, onye isi?
You know it's coming.	Ị maara na ọ na-abịa.
Your best friend, best friend.	Ezigbo enyi gị, ezigbo enyi.
We are used to it.	Ọ mara anyị ahụ́.
I know my size.	Amaara m oke m.
So they come with everything.	Ya mere, ha na ihe niile na-abịa.
This work continues.	Ọrụ a na-aga n'ihu.
He measured it.	Ọ tụrụ ya.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
We will not allow that to happen.	Anyị agaghị ekwe ka nke ahụ mee.
Then life is easy.	Mgbe ahụ, ndụ dị mfe.
Everything is now.	Ihe niile dị ugbu a.
It's like an hour.	Ọ dị ka awa awa.
I will not cry for this.	Agaghị m akwa ákwá maka nke a.
Imagine that you will not see your friend for a long time.	Were ya na ị gaghị ahụ enyi ahụ ruo ogologo oge.
But my mother did not want it.	Ma nne m achọghị.
This house will be, one day, old.	Ụlọ a ga-abụ, otu ụbọchị, ochie.
Not so fun.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
A similar thing is at work.	Ihe yiri ya dị na ọrụ.
They are all friends.	Ha niile bụ enyi.
They made the old couple happy.	Ha mere di na nwunye ochie ahụ obi ụtọ.
The only thing he looked at me.	Naanị ihe o lere m anya.
Running water is good, but not necessary.	Mmiri na-agba ọsọ dị mma, ma ọ dịghị mkpa.
Those conditions are terrible.	Ọnọdụ ndị ahụ dị oke egwu.
Our state of mind is strong and its effects.	Ọnọdụ uche anyị dị ike na mmetụta ya.
He took it quickly.	O were ya ngwa ngwa.
So what is the problem in this country?	Ya mere, gịnị bụ nsogbu obodo a?
There are three possibilities.	E nwere ihe atọ nwere ike ime.
He eventually got his teammates there.	O mechara nweta ndị otu ya ebe ahụ.
A good man is as sweet as he is.	Ezigbo nwoke na-atọ ụtọ dị ka ya.
Of course you would be better off.	N'ezie ị ga-adị mma karịa.
I know this is true.	Ama m na nke a bụ eziokwu.
The word is true.	Okwu ahụ bụ eziokwu.
But that is not good.	Mana nke ahụ adịghị mma.
He looks at them carefully.	O lere ha anya nke ọma.
We can be that.	Anyị nwere ike ịbụ nke ahụ.
That really is.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ezie.
For some months, it did not work.	Ruo ọnwa ụfọdụ, ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
He would not tell me why.	Ọ gaghị agwa m ihe kpatara ya.
But these are special cases.	Mana ndị a bụ ikpe pụrụ iche.
Ships work similarly on boats.	Ụgbọ mmiri na-arụ ọrụ n'otu aka ahụ na ụgbọ mmiri.
Some of them are my friends.	Ụfọdụ n’ime ndị ahụ bụ ndị enyi m.
Wear shoes.	Yiri akpụkpọ ụkwụ.
You need one.	Ị chọrọ otu.
But no plans.	Ma ọ dịghị atụmatụ.
Not after the event.	Ọ bụghị mgbe ihe omume.

His sister hurried out of the way.	Nwanne ya nwanyị mere ngwa ngwa pụọ ​​n'ụzọ.
He has it now.	O nwere ya ugbu a.
Some have feelings.	Ụfọdụ nwere mmetụta.
Not eating, of course.	Ọ bụghị iri nri, n'ezie.
We need to think the same way.	Anyị kwesịrị iche echiche otú ahụ.
She could not help herself.	Ọ nweghị ike inyere onwe ya aka.
We have a little history.	Anyị nwere ntakịrị akụkọ ihe mere eme.
But of course he has.	Ma n'ezie o nwere.
I think it was done because of his condition.	Echere m na e mere ya n'ihi ọnọdụ ya.
I know very well.	M maara nke ọma.
It just went ahead.	Ọ dị nnọọ gara n'ihu.
Of living.	Nke ịdị ndụ.
That is why people like it.	Ọ bụ ya mere ndị mmadụ ji amasị ya.
The baby was born at home.	A mụrụ nwa ahụ n'ụlọ.
And he went out.	O wee pụọ.
We have no food, so we cannot give you food.	Anyị enweghị nri, n'ihi ya, anyị enweghị ike inye gị nri.
You can't do me.	Ị nweghị ike ime m.
Then it was a new country.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ bụ mba ọhụrụ.
he was surprised.	o juru ya anya.
Such a thing.	Ihe dị otú ahụ.
The language is the tree and the tree is the language.	Asụsụ ahụ bụ osisi na osisi bụ asụsụ.
The bag is in my hand.	Akpa ahụ dị m n'aka.
For ten minutes.	Maka nkeji iri.
The weather is bad here in the winter months.	Ọnọdụ ihu igwe dị njọ ebe a na ọnwa oyi.
This is on fire.	Nke a na-agba ọkụ.
There is not a single word to anyone about these things.	Ọ dịghị otu okwu ọ bụla nye onye ọ bụla banyere ihe ndị a.
They can do it themselves.	Ha nwere ike ime onwe ha.
She did all she could to help others.	O mere ike ya niile iji nyere ndị ọzọ aka.
He really liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
This problem is not physical.	Nsogbu a adịghị ka nke anụ ahụ.
He planned to leave, as soon as possible.	O mere atụmatụ ịpụ, ozugbo enwere ike.
Not long.	Ọ bụghị ogologo oge.
But they don't.	Ma ha anaghị eme ya.
But those are words.	Ma ndị ahụ bụ okwu.
You will look better than new.	Ị ga-adị mma ka ọhụrụ.
He wants to do it for you.	Ọ chọrọ ime ya n'aka gị.
Did you eat them? 	Ị riri ha?
he asked.	ọ jụrụ.
The back tastes like fish.	Azụ na-atọ ka azụ.
Try to think.	Na-agbalị iche echiche.
They are going to see a movie.	Ha na-aga ịhụ ihe nkiri.
He got involved.	O tinyere aka na ya.
Now we can no longer.	Ugbu a anyị enweghị ike ọzọ.
When he got home.	Mgbe o rutere n'ụlọ.
I know you now.	Ama m gị ugbu a.
I have a way for it.	Enwere m ụzọ maka ya.
So we thought some more.	Ya mere, anyị chere ụfọdụ ọzọ.
From all your friends.	Site na ndị enyi gị niile.
They have nowhere to go.	Ha enweghị ebe ha ga-aga.
But most people do not do it.	Ma ọtụtụ ndị anaghị eme ya.
They thought it was good.	Ha chere na ọ dị ha mma.
We are used to this.	Nke a mara anyị ahụ́.
On the right, there is a shop by the river.	N'akụkụ aka nri, e nwere ụlọ ahịa dị n'akụkụ osimiri ahụ.
We know they are.	Anyị maara na ha bụ.
The day is hot.	Ụbọchị ahụ gbara ọkụ.
You need help urgently.	Ị chọrọ enyemaka ngwa ngwa.
This surprises him very much.	Nke a tụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
It is a very bold little thing.	Ọ bụ nnọọ obi ike obere ihe.
But it is bad.	Mana ọ dị njọ.
They all have faces.	Ha niile nwere ihu ya.
We are both young.	Anyị abụọ bụ nwata.
Then came the happy news.	Mgbe ahụ, ozi obi ụtọ bịara.
If it were.	A sị na ọ bụ ya.
We need to do something.	Anyị kwesịrị ime ihe.
We want to do what we want.	Anyị chọrọ ime ihe anyị chọrọ.
It's really beautiful.	Ọ mara mma n'ezie.
Or not the time of day he wanted.	Ma ọ bụ ọ bụghị oge nke ụbọchị ọ chọrọ.
There are so many more cars, so many new homes.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụgbọ ala ọzọ, ọtụtụ ụlọ ọhụrụ.
It's fun !!!! 	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ !!!!
There is no such thing.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ.
But there is only one of the most important.	Ma enwere naanị otu nke kacha mkpa.
Let us rest a little.	Ka anyị zuru ike ntakịrị.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
Come to the hospital.	Bịa ụlọ ọgwụ.
For all of them.	Maka ha niile.
But people are awake.	Ma ndị mmadụ mụrụ anya.
As soon as we hung up the phone, a friend of ours called.	Ozugbo anyị kwụsịrị ekwentị, otu enyi anyị kpọrọ ya.
He will do it.	Ọ ga-eme ya.
He allowed me.	O kwere m.
That is a good example.	Ahụ bụ ezigbo ihe atụ.
It’s good to have a full week of work.	Ọ dị mma inwe izu ọrụ zuru oke.
But when you know better, you try to do better.	Ma mgbe ị mara nke ọma, ị na-agbalị ime nke ọma.
I am a citizen.	Abụ m onye obodo.
Not a problem at all.	Ọ bụghị nsogbu ọ bụla.
Nowadays, people are aware of these problems.	N'oge a, ndị mmadụ maara nsogbu ndị a.
He is second this year, only two.	Ọ bụ onye nke abụọ n'afọ a, naanị abụọ.
I'm sure he does.	Eji m n'aka na ọ na-eme ya.

He certainly did.	O doro ya anya na ọ mere.
I was happy, but it surprised me.	Obi dị m ụtọ, mana ọ tụrụ m n'anya.
But another way look at it.	Ma ụzọ ọzọ anya na ya.
He is near.	Ọ nọ n'ebe dị nso.
Still needs some work.	Ka chọrọ ụfọdụ ọrụ.
I love you more than life.	Ahụrụ m gị n'anya karịa ndụ.

He doesn’t really run.	Ọ naghị agba ọsọ n'ezie.
However, there is more.	Otú ọ dị, a ka nwere ihe ndị ọzọ.
It got worse.	Ọ bịara ka njọ.
The only thing I had was that it stopped fast.	Naanị ihe m bụ na ọ kwụsịrị ngwa ngwa.
That would be a great example of that.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ihe atụ ama ama nke ahụ.
You can't do that.	Ị gaghị eme ụdị ihe ahụ.
Something no one sees coming.	Ihe ọ dịghị onye hụrụ na-abịa.

You really liked it.	Ọ masịrị gị nke ukwuu.
The body is too big to be anything else.	Ahụ ahụ dị oke oke nke ịbụ ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
He told me he hated me.	Ọ gwara m na ọ kpọrọ m asị.
How can we help these people?	Olee otú anyị ga-esi nyere ndị a aka?
It’s good by me.	Ọ dị mma site na m.
Do that three times.	Mee nke ahụ atọ.

This couple has three children together.	Di na nwunye a nwere ụmụ atọ ọnụ.
I love the new teachers.	Ahụrụ m ndị ọrụ nkuzi ọhụrụ nọ n'anya.
He lives with his wife and three children.	Ya na nwunye ya na ụmụ ya atọ bi.

It's nice and fast.	Ọ dị mma na ngwa ngwa.

Everyone said so.	Onye ọ bụla kwuru otú ahụ.
It's beautiful, he said.	Ọ mara mma, o kwuru.
This restaurant has a good reputation for good food.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ a nwere aha ọma maka nri dị mma.
There are many other problems that occur.	Enwere ọtụtụ nsogbu ndị ọzọ na-eme.
He wanted me to look at it.	Ọ chọrọ ka m lere ya anya.
There seems to be no place right now.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ebe ugbu a.
You feel up.	Ị na-eche elu.
None were done.	Ọ dịghị nke e mere.
And harder than that.	Na n'ụzọ siri ike karịa nke a.
All in all, this is a fun hour.	N'ihe niile, nke a bụ elekere na-atọ ụtọ.

A few more minutes and we would have been there.	Nkeji ole na ole ọzọ ma anyị gaara anọ ebe ahụ.
He acted responsibly.	O mere ihe n'obi.
And well, with that.	Na nke ọma, na nke ahụ.
He asked the difficult questions.	Ọ jụrụ ajụjụ ndị ahụ siri ike.
Both were immediately weighed.	A tụrụ ha abụọ ozugbo.
It will never be the same.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-abụ otu ihe ahụ.
He will do it.	Ọ ga-eme ya.
The thought bothered him.	Echiche ahụ were ya iwe.
I was the first.	M na mbụ.
But then he went on.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ gara n'ihu.
I saw them once.	Ahụrụ m ha otu ugboro.
This was him a year ago.	Nke a bụ ya otu afọ gara aga.
He thought such a thing would happen.	O chere na ihe dị otú ahụ ga-eme.
Well, of course.	Ọ dị mma, n'ezie.
You have nowhere to go.	O nweghị ebe ị ga-esi ebe ahụ gaa.
Hard work to find.	Ọrụ siri ike ịchọta.
The weather will be perfect for travel.	Ihu igwe ga-adị mma maka njem njem.
Because it is so much more than that.	N'ihi na ọ dị nnọọ ukwuu karịa nke ahụ.
The less he left to get a better chance.	Obere ihe ọ hapụrụ ka ọ nweta ohere ka mma.
That kind of feeling.	Ụdị mmetụta ahụ.
So, what you do is you care about someone else.	Ya mere, ihe ị na-eme bụ ị na-eche banyere onye ọzọ.
He needed to make his own way of life.	Ọ dị mkpa ka o mee ụzọ ndụ nke ya.
I do not see my age.	Ahụghị m afọ ndụ m.
His father, however, did not want him to do that.	Otú ọ dị, nna ya achọghị ka o mee otú ahụ.
The big difference is hunger.	Nnukwu ihe dị iche bụ agụụ.
What is the story today?	Gịnị bụ akụkọ taa?
This is a story.	Nke a bụ akụkọ.
It was a long night.	Ọ bụ ogologo abalị.
The stories are very different.	Akụkọ ndị ahụ dị nnọọ iche.
It has a kind of history of unemployment.	O nwere ụdị akụkọ ihe mere eme nke enweghị ọrụ.

You have been on this road for a long time.	Ị nọ n'ụzọ a ogologo oge.
That does not happen.	Nke ahụ anaghị eme.
The mother is violent.	Nne na-eme ihe ike.
But that is what we are looking for.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị na-achọ.

Many have many weapons.	Ọtụtụ nwere ọtụtụ ngwa ọgụ.
And worse than ever.	Na njọ karịa mgbe ọ bụla ọzọ.
He would never use these words.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-eji okwu ndị a.
You do not like this place?	Ebe a ọ naghị amasị gị?

Nothing special, nothing different.	Ọ dịghị ihe pụrụ iche, ọ dịghị ihe dị iche.

There are weak ones, who are the only ones.	E nwere ndị na-adịghị ike, ndị bụ naanị ndị ahụ.
I am not a coffee and a great man.	Abụghị m kọfị na akwa ụdị nwoke.
She lives with her brother.	Ya na nwanne ya nwoke bi nso.
What are we doing?	Gịnị ka anyị na-eme.
We are cold, we are strong.	Anyị nwere oyi, anyị siri ike.
He can not have.	O nweghị ike inwe.
But the first evil is not his.	Ma ihe ọjọọ nke mbụ abụghị nke ya.
It is a really beautiful city.	Ọ bụ obodo mara mma n'ezie.
It is another reason.	Ọ bụ ihe ọzọ kpatara ya.
Let me get that for you.	Ka m nweta nke ahụ maka gị.
I'm sure he has.	Eji m n'aka na o nwere.
We are in the same city.	Anyị nọ n'otu obodo.
And for good reason.	Na ezi ihe kpatara ya.
Obviously that is your responsibility.	O doro anya na nke ahụ bụ ikike gị.
We like a game.	Otu egwuregwu na-amasị anyị.
These photos are colorful.	Foto ndị a na-agba agba.
I go there scared.	Ana m aga ebe ahụ egwu.
It was summer there.	Ọ bụ oge okpomọkụ n'ebe ahụ.
None of this is required.	Achọghị nke ọ bụla.
His speech was long and cold.	Okwu ya dị ogologo na oyi.
And not many if you can.	Na ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ma ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike.
This is very important.	Nke a dị oke mkpa.
There are actually two services with that name.	Enwere n'ezie ọrụ abụọ nwere aha ahụ.
He was the first person to attend the meeting.	Ọ bụ ya bụ onye mbụ bịara nzukọ ahụ.
You can't be two.	Ị gaghị abụ abụọ.
But my phone.	Mana ekwentị m.
But it is simple.	Mana ọ bụ ihe dị mfe.
Beautiful but cold.	Mara mma mana oyi.
This room is awesome.	Ime ụlọ a dị egwu.
I can't find the books.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ akwụkwọ ndị ahụ.
It is me now.	Ọ bụ m ugbu a.
Why are there so many books about dogs?	Gịnị mere e ji nwee ọtụtụ akwụkwọ gbasara nkịta?
In fact, we hate it more than we enjoy it.	N'ezie, anyị kpọrọ ya asị karịa ihe ụtọ na-amasị anyị.
That’s right, it always happens.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu, ọ na-eme mgbe niile.
There are still two more.	A ka nwere abụọ ọzọ.
They have feelings.	Ha nwere mmetụta.
The students were asked questions.	Ajụjụ juru ụmụ akwụkwọ ahụ.
But, boy, did it happen to you.	Ma, nwa nwoke, o mere gị.
They will be used for some practical purpose.	A ga-eji ha eme ihe ụfọdụ bara uru.
I had that for four weeks or more.	Enwere m nke ahụ ruo izu anọ ma ọ bụ karịa.
Although he needed his strength.	N'agbanyeghị na ọ chọrọ ike ya.
You do them.	Ị na-eme ha.
I know this is a big problem.	Ama m na nke a bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
You can not log out again.	Ị nweghị ike ịpụ ọzọ.
It is almost true.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ eziokwu.
He stayed there for two years.	Ọ nọrọ ebe ahụ afọ abụọ.
It will be in everything.	Ọ ga-abụ n'ihe niile.
He gave it to her.	O nyere ya.
The meeting should not take place.	Nzukọ ahụ ekwesịghị ime.
He hates them.	Ọ kpọrọ ha asị.
This could not be better.	Nke a enweghị ike ịdị mma.
Often, there is something you want to do with the service.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ọ nwere ihe ịchọrọ iji ọrụ ahụ mee.
That's the point.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ya.
It was a pleasure to be there.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ihe obi ụtọ ịnọ ebe ahụ.
The locals expect it to be a rural community.	Ndị obodo ahụ na-atụ anya na ha ga-abụ obodo ime obodo.
There is a lot of water here.	Enwere nnukwu mmiri ebe a.
But only temporarily.	Ma ọ bụ nwa oge.
It can happen again.	O nwere ike ime ọzọ.
This practice has continued from time to time.	Omume a gara n'ihu site n'oge ruo taa.
They both know the truth.	Ha abụọ maara nke bụ́ eziokwu.
My people.	Ndị m.
I will never be so scared again.	Ụjọ agaghị adị m otú ahụ ọzọ.
Of course, it was the best night.	N'ezie, ọ bụ abalị kacha mma.
The drug works well over the years.	Ọgwụ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma na afọ.
He enjoys work.	Ọrụ obi dị ya ụtọ.
Black children are always in trouble.	Ụmụaka ojii na-enwe nsogbu mgbe niile.
The only truth is here.	Naanị eziokwu dị ebe a.
It was what he expected.	Ọ bụ ihe ọ tụrụ anya ya.
Little success in his life.	Obere ihe ịga nke ọma na ndụ ya.
Some do not.	Ụfọdụ adịghị.
We do not like it.	Ọ naghị amasị anyị.
This is now.	Nke a bụ ugbu a.
But his new idea.	Ma echiche ọhụrụ ya.
Your father is a failure.	Nna gị enweghị isi.
That or he does not know.	Nke ahụ ma ọ bụ na ọ maghị.
I drove to the store and got some water.	M gbara ụgbọala gaa n'ụlọ ahịa wee nweta mmiri.
No one asked him any questions.	Ọ dịghị onye jụrụ ya ajụjụ ọ bụla.
Just buy it.	Naanị zụta ya.
Do what they say.	Mee ihe ha kwuru.
I gave birth to him for a while.	M mụrụ ya nwa oge.
It was an eye he had seen only a few times before.	Ọ bụ anya ọ hụrụ naanị ugboro ole na ole gara aga.
He looked only once at his surroundings.	O lere anya naanị otu ugboro na gburugburu ya.
We go to a dance club.	Anyị na-aga n'ụlọ ịgba egwu.
You speak as a child.	Ị na-ekwu okwu ka nwata.
That is not the reason.	Ọ bụghị ya kpatara ya.
If you are.	Ọ bụrụ na ị bụ.
See if there are any trades.	Hụ ma ọ dị ahịa ọ bụla.
You just do your job.	Naanị ị na-arụ ọrụ gị.
He had no choice.	O nweghị ihe ọzọ ọ ga-eme.
But that is key.	Ma, nke ahụ bụ isi.
Have a large pool.	Nwee nnukwu mmiri ọnụ.
I will succeed.	M ga-aga nke ọma.
Thanks but no.	Daalụ mana mba.
We were afraid to go home for lunch.	Anyị tụrụ egwu ịla n’ụlọ rie nri ehihie.

They will not be there.	Ha agaghị anọ ebe ahụ.
It can not happen.	O nweghị ike ime.
He has a great deal to say about what he does.	Ọ nwere ihe dị oke mma gbasara ihe ọ na-eme.
A little girl dances.	Obere nwa agbọghọ na-agba egwu.

The team desperately needed his help.	Ndị otu ahụ chọrọ enyemaka ya nke ọma.
I have a strong hand.	Enwere m aka siri ike.
There is nothing that they can do.	Ọ dịghị ihe ha pụrụ ime.
Not at this time.	Ọ bụghị n'oge a.
Maybe those three are the main points.	Ma eleghị anya, ihe atọ ahụ bụ isi ihe niile.
Sometimes it was breakfast.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ bụ nri ụtụtụ nri ụtụtụ.
No one else.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ.
He didn't want to know the face.	Ọ chọghị ịma ihu ahụ.
You are critical to the success of your organization.	Ị dị oke mkpa maka ịga nke ọma nke nzukọ gị.
Those will be important.	Ndị ahụ ga-adị mkpa.
Their needs were immediately recognized.	A ghọtara mkpa ha ozugbo.
I am not sick.	Adịghị m ọrịa.
They have their own way.	Ha nwere ụzọ nke ha.
It looks beautiful.	Ọ dị ka ọ mara mma.
The child is free.	Nwa ahụ nwere onwe ya.
All you can be is you.	Ihe niile ị nwere ike ịbụ bụ gị.
When that happens, he may need to move on.	Mgbe nke ahụ mere, ọ pụrụ ịdị mkpa ka ọ gaa n'ihu.
He did not know where he came from.	Ọ maghị ebe o si bịa.
Value is needed to achieve this.	Uru dị mkpa iji nweta nke a.
Its work is currently underway.	A na-arụ ọrụ ya ugbu a.
I saw my wife here.	Ahụrụ m nwunye m ebe a.
He was angry.	O were iwe.
These are.	Ndị a bụ.
The man said he was unhappy.	Nwoke ahụ kwuru na obi adịghị ya mma.
Because he knew it.	N'ihi na ọ bụ na ọ maara ya.
She is in poor health, but she is still active.	Ahụ́ ike ya adịghị ya mma, ma ọ ka na-arụ ọrụ.
My last week was my first.	Izu ikpeazụ m bụ nke mbụ ya.
Is that so.	Ọ bụ ya, n'ezie.
There is little need.	Enwere obere mkpa.
I do not know that.	Amaghị nke ahụ.
Take now the example.	Were ugbu a dị ka ihe atụ.
Still, it did.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, o mere.
Then he slapped me on the chest.	Mgbe ahụ ọ mara m ụra n'obi.
You can make things happen more or less repeatedly.	Ị nwere ike ime ka ihe na-eme karịa ma ọ bụ obere ugboro ugboro.
So my second mouth is a different mouth.	Ya mere ọnụ nke abụọ m bụ ọnụ dị iche.
Her clothes are beautiful in color.	Uwe ya mara mma na agba.

Kind of way.	Ụdị ụzọ.

You need to do this immediately.	Ọ dị mkpa ka i mee ihe a ozugbo.
Of time with each other.	Nke oge na onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
I'll tell you something.	Aga m agwa gị ihe.
We were both very surprised.	Ọ tụrụ anyị abụọ n’anya nke ukwuu.
I entered the room.	M banyere n'ime ụlọ.
I wish you were real.	A sị m na ị bụ ezigbo.
But that is just what we are trying to do.	Ma nke ahụ bụ nnọọ ihe anyị na-agbalị ime.
He thought he loved them.	O chere na ya hụrụ ha n'anya.
Really, really good.	N'ezie, ezigbo mma.
That is for men.	Nke ahụ bụ maka ụmụ nwoke.
They know it's a lie.	Ha ma na ọ bụ ụgha.
The reason is similar.	Ihe kpatara ya yiri.
But that will not be good for the child.	Mana nke ahụ agaghị adị mma nye nwata ahụ.
I am very happy.	Adị m mma nke ukwuu.
For companies.	Maka ụlọ ọrụ.
This is a story that gives meaning to our lives.	Nke a bụ akụkọ na-eme ka ndụ anyị nwee isi.

That is what they thought.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ha chere.
Something exists because it would not be the other way around.	Ihe dị adị n'ihi na ọ gaghị abụ ụzọ ọzọ.
He could not get out.	O nweghị ike ịpụ.
I’m sure they will be some of that.	Eji m n'aka na ha ga-abụ ụfọdụ n'ime nke ahụ.
This is our city.	Nke a bụ obodo anyị.
We do not run.	Anyị anaghị agba ọsọ.
The bridge is bad.	Akwa mmiri ahụ adịghị mma.
The old ones are very beautiful.	Ndị ochie mara mma nke ukwuu.

We never looked at anything.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị lere anya n'ihe ọ bụla.
Go somewhere.	Aga ebe.
For companies.	Maka ụlọ ọrụ.

Ignorance is the problem.	Amaghị ihe bụ nsogbu ahụ.
You can get your own boat.	Ị nwere ike nweta ụgbọ mmiri nke gị.
Work and food are good.	Ọrụ na nri dị mma.

Great happiness can be said.	Obi ụtọ dị ukwuu nwere ike ikwu.

He can do it all.	O nwere ike ime ya niile.
So you are looking for another reason to cry.	Ya mere, ị na-achọ ihe ọzọ kpatara ibe ákwá.
Laughter is life threatening.	Ọchị bụ egwu ndụ.

It was very helpful and thoughtful.	Ọ nyere aka nke ukwuu ma nwee echiche.
Where are we going?	Ebee ka anyị na-aga?

At night he goes to the pool.	N'abalị ọ na-aga igwu mmiri.

Now you want to be an actor.	Ugbu a, ịchọrọ ịbụ onye na-eme ihe nkiri.

It's that simple.	Ọ dị mfe otú ahụ.

Your vegetables and meat are fresh.	Akwụkwọ nri gị na anụ gị dị ọhụrụ.
The main idea is this.	Isi echiche bụ nke a.

He just knew he was there.	Ọ maara nnọọ na ọ bụ ebe ahụ.

You told us about it.	Ọ bụ gị gwara anyị banyere ya.
However, it is not strong.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị ike.

Many people do this, not just one.	Ọ bụ ọtụtụ mmadụ na-eme nke a, ọ bụghị naanị otu.

But, help your friend to be perfect.	Ma, nyere enyi gị aka ka ọ bụrụ onye zuru oke.
Waiting for it.	Na-eche ya.

My new machine is just like yours.	Igwe igwe ọhụrụ m dị ka nke gị.

He stays there for several days.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ ọtụtụ ụbọchị.
There is a cold winter coming.	Enwere ihu oyi na-abịa.
But it happens almost often.	Ma ọ na-eme ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ mgbe.
It may not be the perfect way.	Enwere ike ọ gaghị abụ ụzọ zuru oke.
And for the music itself.	Na maka egwu n'onwe ya.
Hence the name.	N'ihi ya, aha.
Of course his eyes.	N'ezie anya ya.
Everyone was there.	Onye ọ bụla nọ ebe ahụ.
But this is the reason.	Ma nke a bụ ihe kpatara ya.
I go to this school.	M na-aga ụlọ akwụkwọ a.
I'm doing well.	A na m eme nke ọma.
A few months in advance.	Ọnwa ole na ole tupu oge.
The trip was important, since the animals were hungry.	Njem ahụ dị mkpa, ebe ọ bụ na agụụ na-agụ anụ ụlọ.
But there is good reason for that.	Ma e nwere ezi ihe kpatara nke ahụ.
That is the law of the land.	Nke ahụ bụ iwu obodo a.
I can't be like this.	Enweghị m ike ịdị ka nke a.
What a character.	Kedu agwa.
They both tried.	Ha abụọ gbalịrị.
He had no chance.	O nweghị ohere.
Certainly not so here.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị otú ahụ ebe a.
Everything you need.	Ihe niile ị chọrọ.
He put his hand inside his.	O tinyere aka ya n'ime aka.
Many plants fell ill.	Ọtụtụ osisi dara ọrịa.
Some types of aunt.	Ụdị ụfọdụ nke nwanne nne.
Ever since you loved me, but from the night you left me.	Kemgbe abalị ị hụrụ m n'anya, ma site n'abalị ị hapụrụ m.
Does anyone know anything?	Ọ nwere onye maara ihe ọ bụla?
He did this.	O mere nke a.

But we only have time.	Mana anyị nwere naanị oge.
No one is behind us.	Ọ dịghị onye nọ n'azụ anyị.
I do not know myself by it.	Amaghị onwe m site na ya.
None of it matters because we have one another.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ dị mkpa n'ihi na anyị nwere ibe anyị.
It came close.	Ọ bịara nso.
I'm sorry for that.	Ọ dị m nwute maka ya.
See if he has any money.	Were ya hụ ma o nwere ego ọ bụla.
Wait a bit.	Chere ntakịrị.
But no one does that.	Ma ọ dịghị onye na-eme otú ahụ.
Our house is being built.	A na-arụ ụlọ anyị.
I think it would have worked.	Echere m na ọ gaara arụ ọrụ.
This is his day.	Nke a bụ ụbọchị ya.
But you can be different.	Ma ị pụrụ iche.
The past year is the past.	Afọ gara aga bụ n'oge gara aga.
They have a house.	Ha nwere ụlọ.
That would be nice.	Nke ahụ ga-adị mma.
My house was surrounded by trees.	Osisi gbara ụlọ m gburugburu.
You are my only hope.	Ị bụ naanị olileanya m.
There is truth of the matter.	Enwere eziokwu nke okwu ahụ.
This, as we know, did not happen.	Nke a, dị ka anyị maara, emeghị.
I look at it now.	M lere ya anya ugbu a.
So he asked me.	Ya mere, ọ jụrụ m.
Please tell me what happened.	Biko gwa m ihe merenụ.
Or, at the very least, no one with that name would do it.	Ma ọ bụ, ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, ọ dịghị onye nwere aha ahụ ga-eme ya.
The money does not belong to me.	Ego ahụ abụghị nke m.
But that is perfect.	Mana nke ahụ zuru oke.
Eleven years, nothing different.	Afọ iri na otu, ọ dịghị ihe dị iche.
I fell asleep twice.	Ụra dara m ugboro abụọ.
We are better than this.	Anyị ka nke a mma.
He continued.	Ọ gara n'ihu.

You take our boat out of here.	Ị kpọrọ anyị ụgbọ mmiri pụọ ebe a.
It’s kind of there.	Ọ bụ ụdị ebe ahụ.
Everything went well until morning.	Ihe niile gara nke ọma ruo ụtụtụ.
But it will not happen.	Ma ọ gaghị eme.
That is how we know what to do.	Nke bụ otú anyị si mara ihe kwesịrị ime.
The staff of the law did nothing.	Ndị ọrụ nke iwu ahụ emeghị ihe ọ bụla.
The main problem.	Isi nsogbu.

She courageously went ahead and helped the man.	O ji obi ike gaa n'ihu inyere nwoke ahụ aka.
The first step is to find hot water.	Ihe mbụ ga-abụ ịchọta mmiri ọkụ.
The last thought stopped him immediately.	Echiche ikpeazụ kwụsịrị ya ikwu okwu ozugbo.
I still love it.	M ka hụrụ ya n'anya.
No, we said.	Mba, anyị kwuru.
Two girls have nothing to do with their mother-in-law.	Ụmụ agbọghọ abụọ na-enweghị ihe ọ bụla nke di nne ha banyere ha.
My mind, my mind.	Uche m, uche m.
It will make sense now.	Ọ ga-enwe isi ugbu a.
This is happening in other parts of the country.	Nke a na-eme n'akụkụ ndị ọzọ nke mba ahụ.
It certainly is that bad.	N'ezie ọ dị njọ otú ahụ.
You need to take action.	I kwesịrị ime ihe banyere nke ahụ.

And boy, does that happen.	Na nwa nwoke, na-eme mgbe.
Just what he wants to do.	Naanị ihe ọ chọrọ ime.
It will not happen.	Ọ gaghị eme.
He immediately sat down.	Ọ nọdụ ala ozugbo.
He looked into the fire.	O lere anya n'ime ọkụ.
He knew what was there.	Ọ maara ihe dị n'ebe ahụ.
The music we like is the most moving.	Egwu anyị masịrị bụ nke kacha aga n'ihu.

This information is important for my challenge.	Ozi a dị mkpa maka ịma aka m.
How did this accident happen?	Kedu ka ihe mberede a siri mee?
I want to leave.	Achọrọ m isi ebe ahụ pụọ.
Let the big house.	Ka nnukwu ụlọ.
He is going now.	Ọ na-aga ugbu a.
That could not help.	Nke ahụ enweghị ike inyere aka.
The difference is true for a woman.	Ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu maka nwanyị.
It is not that hard to do.	Ọ dịghị esi ike otú ahụ ime.
Look at it.	Anya na ya.
Or what is in them.	Ma ọ bụ ihe dị n'ime ha.
But with high quality, which is weak.	Ma na elu mma, nke na-adịghị ike.
Almost everyone else got a chance to speak.	Naanị obere ka onye ọ bụla ọzọ nwetara ohere ikwu okwu.
I was terrified and excited.	Ụjọ tụrụ m nke ukwuu na obi ụtọ.
So you play the game.	Ya mere ị na-egwu egwuregwu.
I do not know what to do with the fact.	Amaghị ihe ị ga-eme na eziokwu ahụ.
But now you know.	Ma ugbu a, ị maara.
What more do we need, of course.	Kedu ihe ọzọ anyị chọrọ, n'ezie.
Up to my office, but nothing.	Ruo n'ụlọ ọrụ m, mana o nweghị ihe ọ bụla.
It's smaller than that.	Ọ dị obere karịa.
I was always in trouble.	Anọ m na-enwe nsogbu mgbe niile.
Stop that!	Kwụsị nke ahụ!
They did not see how bad that was, at first.	Ha ahụghị otú nke ahụ si bụrụ ihe ọjọọ, na mbụ.
I would not be there for two weeks when it happened.	Agaghị m ebe ahụ izu abụọ mgbe o mere.
I never wanted to be friends with you!	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chọrọ ka gị na gị bụrụ enyi!
The man did it well.	Nwoke ahụ mere ya nke ọma.
We talked about it.	Anyị kwuru banyere ya.
We love one another.	Anyị hụrụ ibe anyị n'anya.
If it is good, do it alone.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mma, mee ya naanị.
You are human.	Ị bụ mmadụ.
It would be awesome if it didn’t go away.	Ọ ga-adị egwu ma ọ bụrụ na ọ gaghị aga.
I am happy.	Enwere m obi ụtọ.
He thought no one knew.	O chere na o nweghị onye maara.
Many events were held during the three days.	E mere ọtụtụ ihe omume n'ime ụbọchị atọ ahụ.
That is what he did.	Otú ahụ ka o mere.
Another reason for this is for two reasons.	Ọzọ ihe kpatara nke a ji eme bụ n'ihi ihe abụọ.
Give it a week.	Nye ya otu izu.
The city is famous for its music.	Obodo a ma ama maka egwu ya.
Others say they are having lunch.	Ndị ọzọ na-ekwu na ha nọ na nri ehihie.
They will.	Ha ga-eme.
No financial or family problems.	Enweghị nsogbu ego ma ọ bụ ezinụlọ.
I do not know if we ever had the opportunity to do it.	Amaghị m na ọ dị mgbe anyị nwere ohere ime ya.
He will have a little tutorial on it once.	Ọ ga-enwe obere nkuzi na ya otu ugboro.
Like it never really does.	Dị ka ọ naghị eme n'ezie.
He loved her for that.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya maka nke ahụ.
People like it.	Ndị mmadụ na-amasị ya.
Not for himself.	Ọ bụghị maka onwe ya.
I wonder how she would feel if she knew my plans.	M na-eche otú ọ ga-adị ya ma ọ mara atụmatụ m.
The page has many questions.	Ibe nwere ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
It seems to have no weight.	O yiri ka o nweghị ibu.
Some are longer.	Ụfọdụ dị ogologo.
Some of his work is.	Ụfọdụ ọrụ ya bụ.
Otherwise.	Ma ọ bụghị ya.
He does this for two hours every day.	Ọ na-eme ihe ahụ awa abụọ kwa ụbọchị.
The monkey's face was made of paper.	E ji akwụkwọ mee ihu enwe.
I do not like.	Ọ naghị amasị m.
But if he is a black man.	Mana ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ nwoke ojii.
For a number of reasons.	N'ihi ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
One afternoon he fell asleep indoors.	N'otu ehihie, ọ dara ụra n'ime ụlọ.
Is anyone else out there still wondering?!?.	Ọ nwere onye ọzọ nọ ebe ahụ ka na-eche?!?.
I was both shocked.	Unu abụọ juru m obi.
He is a bad boy.	Ọ bụ nwa ọjọọ.
Should be different from the name.	Kwesịrị ịdị iche na aha.
Both are big cities.	Ha abụọ bụ nnukwu obodo.
The other should be called in other forms.	Ekwesịrị ịkpọ nke ọzọ na ụdị ndị ọzọ.
He did not need to be there.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ka ọ nọrọ ebe ahụ.
No one ever expected.	Ọ dịghị onye na-atụ anya mgbe ọ bụla.
I want to see you.	A chọrọ m ịhụ gị.
I think it is you.	Echere m na ọ bụ gị.
Police arrived at the house.	Ndị uwe ojii bịara n'ụlọ ahụ.
He did not know what to say.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ chọrọ ikwu.
Let's take the example of a fool.	Ka anyị were ụdị ihe atụ nzuzu.
I have been doing that for many years.	M na-eme nke ahụ kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
Suppose this is not true.	Ka e were ya na nke a abụghị eziokwu.
It's really hard.	Ọ siri ike n'ezie.
Life is a gift.	Ndụ bụ onyinye.
Students saw them go to school.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ hụrụ ha ka ha na-aga akwụkwọ.
Then his health deteriorated.	Mgbe ahụ ahụ ike ya dara.
In fact, it’s almost a little better.	N'ezie, ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ dị ntakịrị mma.
You will not tell me what to do.	Ị gaghị agwa m ihe m ga-eme.
That is a fundamental right.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ ikike bụ́ isi.
It's like that.	Ọ dị ka nke ahụ.
There are two types of hypocrisy.	Enwere ụdị ihu abụọ.
Without water, we would not live long.	Enweghị mmiri, anyị agaghị adị ogologo ndụ.
I don’t know who that might be.	Amaghị m onye nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ.
I am your son.	Abụ m nwa gị nwoke.
It is good for the baby.	Ọ dị mma maka nwa ahụ.
But it is true of another letter.	Ma ọ bụ eziokwu ihe akwụkwọ ozi ọzọ kwuru.
This is stupid.	Nke a dị nzuzu.
There is no problem with it.	Enweghị nsogbu na ya.
In many other ways.	Na ọtụtụ ụzọ ndị ọzọ.
She obviously did not feel well today.	O doro anya na ahụ adịghị ya mma taa.
I would like to go.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịga.
So we can stop there.	Ya mere, anyị nwere ike kwụsị ebe ahụ.
We have a strong group of girls.	Anyị nwere otu siri ike nke ụmụ agbọghọ.
The law works.	Iwu na-arụ ọrụ.
Not in his heart.	Ọ bụghị n'obi ya.
But you don't use it.	Ma ị naghị eji ya.
He does not have this.	Ọ naghị enwe nke a.
There are no windows.	O nweghị windo.
This is due to their high cost.	Nke a bụ n'ihi oke ọnụ ahịa ha.
There should be a law.	Ekwesịrị inwe iwu.
In the distance.	N'ebe dị anya ya.
You tried to help, but you felt you made it worse.	Ị gbalịrị inye aka, mana ọ dị gị ka i mere ka ọ ka njọ.
He wanted the job.	Ọ chọrọ ọrụ ahụ.
That's how he sees it.	Otú ahụ ka o si hụ ya.
Give yourself that strength.	Nye onwe gị ike ahụ.
Once in a while winter comes quickly.	N'otu oge oyi na-abịa ngwa ngwa.
Two things about this.	Ihe abụọ gbasara nke a.
I thought it might be hard, but it's not.	Echere m na ọ nwere ike isi ike, mana ọ bụghị.
No one told me.	Ọ dịghị onye gwara m.
Meals should have plenty of vegetables.	Nri kwesịrị inwe ọtụtụ akwụkwọ nri.
He lives near here.	O bi nso ebe a.
He would not like it, he said.	Ọ gaghị amasị ya, o kwuru.
You will be able to do the following.	Ị ga-enwe ike ime ihe ndị a.
I never felt like I wasn’t there.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ dị m ka enweghị m ebe ahụ.
He does not know how he did it.	Ọ maghị otú o si mee ya.
I can do this.	Enwere m ike ime nke a.
They are men.	Ha bụ ụmụ nwoke.
We do not think so.	Anyị echeghị na nke ahụ.
His face was on both sides.	Ihu ya dị n'akụkụ abụọ.
The food is simple and delicious.	Nri dị mfe ma dị ụtọ.
I never really thought about how he got there.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chere n'ezie otú o si ruo ebe ahụ.
During their travels, they encountered repeated acts of violence.	N'oge njem ha, ha zutere ime ihe ike ugboro ugboro.
But it is worth it.	Ma ọ bara uru.
So I went and left.	M wee pụọ wee pụọ.
I don't like my mind.	Enweghị m mmasị na uche m.
It is not easy.	Ọ bụghị ihe dị mfe.
Unreasonable hours are required.	A chọrọ awa ọrụ na-enweghị ezi uche.
Having such a gift is not easy.	Inwe ụdị onyinye a anaghị adị mfe.
They need their food.	Ebe nri ha si dị dị ha mkpa.
Everything happened to him now.	Ihe niile mere ya ugbu a.
As follows.	Dị ka ndị a.
Wait a minute.	Chere obere oge.
Lots more really.	Ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ n'ezie.
I like it.	Ọ masịrị m n'anya.
Things started to get high.	Ihe malitere ịdị elu.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ihe si aga.
Which is kind of stupid to say.	Nke bụ ụdị ihe nzuzu ikwu.
Imagine that you are feeling very well.	Were ya na ị na-enwe mmetụta nke ọma.
But that's what's happening.	Ma, nke ahụ bụ ihe na-eme.
You are as involved as I am.	Ị tinyere aka dị ka m.
It is the most important food of your day.	Ọ bụ nri kacha mkpa nke ụbọchị gị.
None of them are for children.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha bụ maka ụmụaka.

I think that was the last thing we wanted.	Echere m na nke ahụ bụ ihe ikpeazụ anyị chọrọ.
This is his idea.	Nke a bụ echiche ya.
They did not understand me at all.	Ha aghọtaghị m ma ọlị.
Looking to get their city.	Na-achọ ị nweta obodo ha.
He will probably be happy.	Eleghị anya ọ ga-enwe obi ụtọ.
Lots and lots of awesome stuff.	Ọtụtụ na ihe dị egwu.

Everything is verbal.	Ihe niile bụ okwu okwu.

You have been working on this for months.	Ị na-arụ ọrụ na nke a kemgbe ọnwa.
I said no, again.	M wee sị mba, ọzọ.
Her mother would come every minute.	Nne ya ga-abịa nkeji ọ bụla.
But when he saw me, he was terrified.	Ma mgbe ọ hụrụ m, ọ bụ ya bụ onye ụjọ.
There was nothing he could do until then.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ pụrụ ime ruo mgbe ahụ.
The truth here is a bit of a problem.	Eziokwu ebe a bụ ntakịrị nsogbu.
More information is here.	Ozi ndị ọzọ dị ebe a.
These days, most people live in one city.	Ụbọchị ndị a, ọtụtụ mmadụ bi n'otu obodo.
But we are not working for ourselves anymore.	Mana anyị anaghị arụ ọrụ maka onwe anyị ọzọ.
Others seem to have none.	Ndị ọzọ dị ka ha enweghị nke ọ bụla.
They will not care.	Ha agaghị achọ ịma.
No one knows why.	O nweghị onye ma ihe kpatara ya.
We drove for hours.	Anyị ji ụgbọala ruo ọtụtụ awa.
There was a time of backsliding on their side.	Enwere oge nke ịla azụ n'akụkụ ha.

A couple police officers were there.	Ndị uwe ojii di na nwunye nọ ebe ahụ.
It is a large, beautiful tree.	Ọ bụ nnukwu osisi mara mma.

Instant messaging made it faster.	Ozi ngwa ngwa mere ya ngwa ngwa.
Some of them drowned.	Mmiri riri ụfọdụ n’ime ha.
Need to have someone in me.	Mkpa inwe onye n'ime m.
This is just another game.	Nke a bụ naanị egwuregwu ọzọ.
Happiness is our problem.	Obi ụtọ bụ nsogbu anyị.

The boat stopped at shore.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ kwụsịrị n'akụkụ mmiri.

Some of these books contain useful information.	Ụfọdụ n'ime akwụkwọ ndị a nwere ozi bara uru.
If you sit too long, you will only get harder.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nọdụ ogologo oge, ị ga-esi isi ike.

They don’t do too much perfection.	Ha anaghị eme oke oke zuru oke.
However, they wanted to keep me out of the sight.	Otú ọ dị, ha chọrọ ime ka m ghara ịhụ anya.
The main point is fun.	Isi ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
If it was for the room, we had it !.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ maka ime ụlọ, anyị nwere ya!.
I wish he was here to see me play.	Ọ dị m ka ya bụrụ na ọ nọ ebe a hụ m ka m na-egwu egwu.

It’s kind of a day.	Ọ bụ ụdị nke ụbọchị.
I would like you to wait until then.	Ọ ga-amasị m ma ọ bụrụ na ị chere ruo mgbe ahụ.
It was vacation time.	Ọ bụ oge ezumike.

You need to see their faces.	I kwesịrị ịhụ otú ihu ha dị.
He told his companions to act.	Ọ gwara ndị ibe ya ka ha mee ihe.
He did not want to be named.	Ọ chọghị ịma aha.
I hope for the best.	Ana m atụ anya ihe kacha mma.
But many in the country are still afraid to speak out.	Mana ọtụtụ ndị nọ na mba ahụ ka na-atụ ụjọ ikwu okwu.

Well then, that’s what it should be.	Ọ dị mma mgbe ahụ, nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ ga-abụ.
And we go.	Na anyị na-aga.

There are more cars on the road than ever before.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụgbọ ala n'ụzọ karịa mgbe ọ bụla.

Running water is essential for life.	Mmiri na-agba ọsọ dị mkpa maka ndụ.

None of these things have any effect.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a nwere mmetụta ọ bụla.

You have to go immediately.	Ị ga-aga ozugbo.

Those who want it will not find it.	Ndị chọrọ ya agaghị ahụ ya.

The book, however, is quite different.	Otú ọ dị, akwụkwọ ahụ dị nnọọ iche na nke a.
There are many benefits to this diet.	Enwere ọtụtụ uru na nri a.
There were different emotions at the time.	A na-enwe mmetụta dị iche iche n'oge ahụ.
Is he expecting it?	Ọ na-atụ anya ya?
Nonsense.	Ihe na-enweghị isi.
Good medicine is a good rule.	Ezi ọgwụ bụ ezigbo iwu.
Why is this happening?	Gịnị mere nke a ji eme?
But it can make a lot of sense for both groups.	Mana ọ nwere ike ime ọtụtụ echiche maka otu abụọ ahụ.
We can see how this goes.	Anyị nwere ike ịhụ otú nke a si aga.
But he was alone.	Ma ọ nọ naanị ya.

You can't hate that.	Ị nweghị ike ịkpọ nke ahụ asị.

He does not seem to eat at all.	O yiri ka ọ naghị eri nri ma ọlị.
As a result, they argue, this court has no jurisdiction.	N'ihi ya, ha na-ekwu na ụlọ ikpe a enweghị ikike.

What other good ideas are there?	Kedu echiche ọma ndị ọzọ dị?.

You need to give them more than that.	I kwesịrị inye ha ọtụtụ ihe karịa nke ahụ.
For us it is different.	Maka anyị ọ dị iche.
Only one thing seemed to frighten him.	Naanị otu ihe yiri ka ọ tụrụ ya ụjọ.

It gave him the strength to move on.	O nyere ya ike ịga n'ihu.
Perhaps he hoped to do so.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ tụrụ anya na ọ ga-eme otú ahụ.
Parental authority is vested in the child.	E nyere nne na nna ikike ikike nke nwa ahụ.
This movie says that people want to be better.	Ihe nkiri a na-ekwu na ndị mmadụ na-achọ ịbụ ihe ka mma.

Good name for the city.	Ezi aha maka obodo.
You are really beautiful.	Ị mara mma n'ezie.
The reasons for this are as follows.	Ihe kpatara nke a bụ ndị a.
He got the first one.	O nwetara nke mbụ.
All you need is there.	Ihe ị chọrọ bụ ebe ahụ.
No one else can do it.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ nwere ike ime ya.

Of course, it did well through me.	N'ezie, o mere nke ọma site na m.
He wants to know you.	Ọ chọrọ ịma gị.
That name does not matter.	Aha ahụ adịghị mkpa.
The first plan is very high.	Atụmatụ mbụ dị elu nke ukwuu.
This is community life, in every city.	Nke a bụ ndụ obodo, n'ime obodo ọ bụla.

You think he is your father, in a sense.	Ị chere na ọ bụ nna gị, na uche.
I just thought it was funny.	Naanị m chere na ọ bụ ihe ọchị.
They do not run after us.	Ha anaghị agba anyị ọsọ.
But it did, and it happened.	Ma o mere, o wee mee.
Now something obviously happened.	Ugbu a, o doro anya na e nwere ihe merenụ.
He will do well.	Ọ ga-eme nke ọma.
Keep doing this.	Gaa n'ihu na-eme nke a.
I'm good at that.	Adị m mma na nke ahụ.
It is because people are happy.	Ọ bụ n'ihi na ndị mmadụ na-enwe obi ụtọ.

Of course, they have different rooms.	N'ezie, ha nwere ọnụ ụlọ dị iche iche.
Dear friend.	Ezigbo enyi.

Most of the latter.	Ọtụtụ n'ime nke ikpeazụ.
That should be sufficient for two reasons.	Ọ ga-abụ otú ahụ n'ihi ihe abụọ.

It is an act of last hope.	Ọ bụ omume enweghị olileanya ikpeazụ.

This is food for both of them.	Nke a bụ ihe oriri nye ha abụọ.
I do not want to do it.	Achọghị m ime ya.
He probably knows more about these realities than real workers.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ maara ihe ndị a na-eme eme karịa ndị ọrụ n'ezie.
Great job.	Nnukwu ọrụ.
It is a task.	Ọ bụ ọrụ.
He hates it.	Ọ kpọrọ ya asị.

I was surprised when you called her.	O juru m anya mgbe ị kpọrọ ya.
We are satisfied with you.	Anyị na gị afọ juru.
Of course not.	N'ezie adịghị eme ha.
This is the family here.	Nke a bụ ezinụlọ ebe a.
This is probably why it is no.	Nke a bụ eleghị anya ihe mere o ji bụrụ mba.
It was funny, he continued.	Ọ bụ ihe ọchị, ọ gara n'ihu.
She is upset about it.	Obi adịghị ya mma n’ihi ya.
In it like a man.	N'ime ya dị ka nwoke.
The first joke was a huge success.	Ihe ọchị nke mbụ bụ nnukwu ihe ịga nke ọma.

You know the feeling when you are scared or interested.	Ị maara mmetụta ahụ mgbe ụjọ na-atụ gị ma ọ bụ nwee mmasị.
I want this to not exist.	Achọrọ m ka nke a ghara ịdị adị.
Still, problems remain.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, nsogbu ka dị.

The climate here is very pleasant.	Ihu igwe ebe a na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
He was the first person to fall ill.	Ọ bụ ya bụ onye mbụ dara ọrịa.
That is the bad news.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ọjọọ ahụ.
He wants to be told what to do.	Ọ chọrọ ka a gwa ya ihe ọ ga-eme.

One advantage that the city has over the city is that.	Otu uru obodo ahụ nwere karịa obodo bụ nke ahụ.

No one asked him for anything.	Ọ dịghị onye jụrụ ya ihe ọ bụla.
On this trip, however, there were no problems.	Otú ọ dị, na njem a, ọ dịghị nsogbu ọ bụla.

Do they know what you are saying?	Ha maara ihe ị na-ekwu?
No one else has the right to say anything.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ nwere ohere ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
He did not want it to be that way.	Ọ chọghị ka ọ dị otú ahụ.
You don’t want me to have anything of my own.	Ị chọghị ka m nwee ihe ọ bụla nke m.
Everything comes up with a reason.	Ihe niile na-abịa na ihe kpatara ya.
Things are very different.	Ihe dị nnọọ iche.
He and his girlfriend are planning a summer vacation.	Ya na enyi ya nwanyị na-eme atụmatụ ezumike okpomọkụ.

You can do it and you will do it.	Ị nwere ike ime ya ma ị ga-eme ya.

Is there anything you can do about that?	Ọ nwere ihe ị nwere ike ime gbasara nke ahụ?

But he knew what his job was.	Ma ọ ma ihe ọrụ ya bụ.
He did not know how.	Ọ maghị ka o si mee.
We will continue with the project.	Anyị ga-aga n'ihu na ọrụ ahụ.
It is not a water spirit.	Ọ bụghị mmụọ mmiri.
Whatever it is.	Ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ.
He certainly liked it.	O doro anya na ọ masịrị ya.
I do not know where he would have gone.	Amaghị m ebe ọ gaara aga.
He could not attend the meeting.	O nweghị ike ịga nzukọ ahụ.
Please help me with this.	Biko nyere m aka na nke a.
Before he came, he did something wrong.	Tupu ọ bịa, o mere ihe na-adịghị mma.
He gave himself willingly.	O ji obi ya nye onwe ya.
You are small.	Ị dị obere.
In the community, it is the children's job.	N'ime obodo, ọ bụ ọrụ ụmụaka.
I do not understand this practice.	Aghọtaghị m omume a.
Most likely they will.	O yikarịrị ka ha ga-eme ya.
Only his head was in the room.	Naanị isi ya dị n'ime ụlọ ahụ.
For one thing, it is not simply a matter of looking at it.	Otu ihe bụ na ọ bụghị naanị n'ime ka o lere anya.
A fourth person is required for questioning.	A chọrọ onye nke anọ maka ajụjụ.
If anyone has an ear, let him hear.	Ọ bụrụ na onye ọ bụla nwere ntị, ya nụrụ.

They will help him.	Ha ga-enyere ya aka.
On your way, boy.	N'ụzọ gị, nwa nwoke.
He liked his work.	Ọrụ ya masịrị ya.
Other books look at the big river.	Akwụkwọ ndị ọzọ lere anya na nnukwu osimiri ahụ.
They want strong men.	Ha chọrọ ndị nwoke siri ike.
We will do something now.	Anyị ga-eme ihe ugbu a.
So thank you for being here.	Ya mere daalụ maka ịnọ ebe a.
Thanks to everyone who helped.	Daalụ onye ọ bụla nyere aka.
You left there.	Ị hapụrụ ebe ahụ.
But they keep going.	Ma ha na-aga n'ihu.
I may be one of you, he said.	Enwere m ike ịbụ otu n'ime unu, o kwuru.

His eyes widened.	Anya ya lere ya anya.
But this is obviously not possible.	Mana o doro anya na nke a agaghị ekwe omume.
This is your last chance to make the most of your life.	Nke a bụ ohere ikpeazụ gị iji mee ihe nke ndụ gị.
It is your problem.	Ọ bụ nsogbu gị.
That is really the point here.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ezie okwu ebe a.
What everyone wants.	Ihe onye ọ bụla na-achọ.
It's a short time.	Ọ bụ obere oge.
I told my mother that none of this was true.	Agwara m nne m na ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ya bụ eziokwu.
Read it daily.	Na-agụ ya kwa ụbọchị.
This does not, and probably does not exist.	Nke a adịghị, ma eleghị anya ọ gaghị adị.
It took a while.	O were obere oge.
I am very familiar with it.	Ama m nke ọma na ya.
None of us did.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị mere.
But we need not be that way.	Ma anyị ekwesịghị ịbụ ndị ahụ.
Which is the oldest of these stories?	Kedu nke kacha ochie n'ime akụkọ ndị a?
I know that very well.	Amaara m nke ahụ nke ọma.
For a long time.	Ruo ọtụtụ oge.
So here's the thing.	Ya mere, ebe a bụ ihe.
I'm sure it will be in a day or two.	Eji m n'aka na ọ ga-abụ n'ime otu ụbọchị ma ọ bụ abụọ.
They are the same type.	Ha bụ otu ụdị.
People like color more.	Agba na-amasị ndị mmadụ karịa.
And now the truth is, not the mind.	Na ugbu a, eziokwu dị, ọ bụghị uche.
He wanted to leave, but he could not.	Ọ chọrọ ịpụ, ma o nweghị ike.
I could be there for many years.	Enwere m ike ịnọ ebe ahụ ọtụtụ afọ.
However, there is a problem.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere otu nsogbu.
Too big.	Dị oke oke.
And they went out from him.	Ha wee si n’ebe ọ nọ pụọ.
However, this is not the case before this court.	Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị okwu n'ihu ụlọ ikpe a.
He knows very well.	Ọ maara nke ukwuu.
You think.	Ị na-eche.

Around this they went.	Gburugburu nke a ka ha gara.
They have no children.	Ha enweghị ụmụ.
Talk to him.	Gwa ya okwu.
That sounds bad.	Nke ahụ yiri ihe ọjọọ.

He still has something to do.	Ọ ka nwere ihe ọ ga-eme.
I never wanted children.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chọrọ ụmụaka.
There is no such man.	Ọ dịghị nwoke dị otú ahụ.
The important thing is that the book makes you feel good.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ na akwụkwọ na-eme gị mma.
There is no space in the room.	O nweghị ohere n'ime ụlọ.
He thought he was upset.	O chere na obi adịghị ya mma.
Your mother will want it.	Nne gị ga-achọ ya.
Within two years, the idea seemed to move forward.	N'ime afọ abụọ, echiche ahụ yiri ka ọ na-aga n'ihu.
You will not be able to do it yourself.	Ị gaghị enwe ike ime ya n'onwe gị.
All the cars stopped.	Ụgbọ ala ndị ahụ niile kwụsịrị.
I don't want his money.	Achọghị m ego ya.

Something like time, too.	Ihe dị ka oge, kwa.
You are strong.	Ị dị ike.

Please help me see the problem is if you can.	Biko nyere m aka ka m hụ nsogbu bụ ma ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike.
But now he can think clearly and carefully.	Ma ugbu a, o nwere ike iche echiche nke ọma na nke ọma.
That was a huge impact.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu mmetụta.
That is not his way.	Nke ahụ abụghị ụzọ ya.
People will do anything.	Ndị mmadụ ga-eme ihe ọ bụla.
My patients are happy.	Ndị ọrịa m nwere obi ụtọ.
This is where the team first faces the problem.	Ebe a ka otu chere nsogbu nke mbụ ihu.

Let's get them.	Ka anyị mee ka ha nweta ya.
They never met in person.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha zutere na mmadụ.

So talk to me, while you can still.	Ya mere gwa m okwu, mgbe ị ka nwere ike.
So far, it has not been fun.	Ruo ugbu a, ọ bụghị ihe na-atọ ụtọ.

All you have to do is sit back and relax.	Naanị ihe ị ga-eme bụ nọdụ ala ma zuru ike.

These best ones will do nothing.	Ndị a kacha mma agaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.
I was amazed at how quickly time went by.	Ọ tụrụ m n'anya otú oge na-aga ngwa ngwa.
That is why we love life.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị ji hụ ndụ n’anya.

How much does a new machine cost?	Ego ole ka igwe igwe ọhụrụ na-eri?

He was either unhappy or unhappy.	Obi adịghị ya ụtọ ma ọ bụ na obi adịghị ya ụtọ.

That is a beautiful idea.	Nke ahụ bụ echiche mara mma.
This cannot go on.	Nke a enweghị ike ịga n'ihu.
So the price actually rejected seems to be reasonable.	Ya mere, ọnụ ahịa a jụrụ n'ezie yiri ka ọ bụ ezi uche.
You are not really afraid.	Ụjọ adịghị gị n'ezie.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.

Many people live there.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ bi ebe ahụ.

Not the first time.	Ọ bụghị nke mbụ.
However, it was not his.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị nke ya.
But that can not be.	Ma nke ahụ enweghị ike ịbụ.
Either thing or space around.	Ma ihe ma ọ bụ ohere gburugburu.
Again, this is a reason to look for a plan.	Ọzọ, nke a bụ ihe mere ị ga-eji chọọ atụmatụ.
Just because your motives are bad.	Naanị na oke ihe kpatara gị adịghị mma.

I should have done such a weakness.	Ekwesịrị m ime adịghị ike otú ahụ.
The house is on fire.	Ụlọ ahụ gbara ọkụ.
During the three days, no words were used.	N'ime ụbọchị atọ ahụ, a naghị eji okwu eme ihe.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution.	Ruo ugbu a ọ nweghị onye nwere ike.
He is both human and not human.	Ọ bụ ma mmadụ ma ọ bụghị mmadụ.

His job is female.	Ọrụ ya na-arụ nwanyị.
The workers are in financial trouble.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ nọ na nsogbu ego.
We yearn for new power, for profit.	Anyị na-agụ agụụ maka ikike ọhụrụ, maka uru.

But he had friends.	Ma o nwere ndị enyi.

Immediately, he was impressed.	Ozugbo, ọ masịrị ya.

So time is not what I am.	Ya mere, oge abụghị ihe m bụ.
Everything is clear.	Ihe niile doro anya.
A well-known company.	Ụlọ ọrụ a ma ama.
When he saw you there.	Mgbe ọ hụrụ gị n'ebe ahụ.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
He could not say his way out of this.	Ọ nweghị ike ikwu ụzọ ya pụọ ​​na nke a.

Nothing serious.	Ọ dịghị mkpa.

We do not want money for this month.	Anyị achọghị ego maka ọnwa a.

He told them that he was terrified.	Ọ gwara ha na ụjọ tụrụ ya.
It is more than that.	Ọ karịrị nke ahụ.
He looked at his watch.	O lere anya elekere ya.
Awesome here.	Dị egwu ebe a.
The former is good.	Nke mbụ dị mma.

His style of speech is very limited.	Ụdị okwu ya nwere oke oke.
The question is what to do about it.	Ajụjụ bụ ihe a ga-eme maka ya.
It looked good, but not my way.	O lere anya nke ọma, mana ọ bụghị ụzọ m.
And as things go, sometimes you can opt out.	Na ka ihe na-aga, mgbe ụfọdụ ị nwere ike ịpụ.
I want to do it.	Achọrọ m ka m mee ya.
He stopped in front of the mirror.	Ọ kwụsịrị n'ihu enyo.
The occupants of the house arrived shortly after.	Ndị bi n’ụlọ ahụ rutere n’oge na-adịghị anya.
You know how he felt about the house and his mother.	Ị ma otú obi dị ya banyere ụlọ ahụ na nne ya.
A lot of things are pointless.	Ọtụtụ ihe enweghị isi.
I long for my old fish.	Ọ na-agụ m agụụ maka azụ m ochie.

The room is small.	Ụlọ ahụ dị obere.
The people are amazed.	O juru ndị obodo ahụ anya.
It is done.	A na-eme ya.
I hope you understand.	Enwere m olileanya na ị ghọtara.
His eyes are like a challenge.	Anya ya dị ka ihe ịma aka.
That is nothing new now.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe ọhụrụ ugbu a.
He is a terrible liar.	Ọ bụ onye ụgha dị egwu.
He can do nothing.	Ọ nweghị ike ime ihe ọ bụla.
There is no place to sit.	Enweghị ebe ịnọ ọdụ.
He could soon buy a motorbike.	N’oge na-adịghị anya, o nwere ike zụta ụgbọ ala igwe ihe.
We thought there was something wrong here.	Anyị chere na ọ dị ihe na-adịghị mma ebe a.
In the second book.	Na akwụkwọ nke abụọ.

To take a car.	Iji were ụgbọ ala.
I will leave the bar.	M ga-esi n'ụlọ mmanya pụọ.
They are my strength.	Ha bụ ike m.
Many countries want to take advantage of this opportunity.	Ọtụtụ mba chọrọ iji ohere a mee ihe.
He gave me a smile.	O nyere m ọnụ ọchị.
Really really really.	N'ezie n'ezie n'ezie.
I will miss you.	Aga m atụ uche gị.
His heart was warm.	Obi ya dị ọkụ.
Hard to say.	O siri ike ikwu.
You know what they are.	Ị maara ihe ha bụ.
There is no financial value.	Enweghị uru ego.
It seems simple.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị mfe.
But it did happen.	Ma o mere n'ezie.
The baby cries.	Nwata akwa akwa.
Maybe we can do something.	Ma eleghị anya, anyị nwere ike ime ihe.
But that's not pretty.	Mana ọ bụghị nke ahụ mara mma.
But most of you do it because you want to.	Ma ọtụtụ n'ime ị na-eme ya n'ihi na ị chọrọ.
Not just because it is timely.	Ọ bụghị naanị n'ihi na ọ bụ n'oge.
Wear continuous clothing.	Yiri uwe na-aga n'ihu.
Maybe it's true.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ eziokwu.
And about that.	Na banyere nke ahụ.
Help us help you !.	Nyere anyị aka inyere gị aka!.
It is one of those things.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ihe ndị ahụ.
A similar dress came.	Uwe yiri ya bịara.
I really needed to talk to him.	Ọ dị m mkpa n'ezie ịgwa ya okwu.
This winter, the temperature is lower.	Oge oyi a, okpomọkụ dị ala.
Of course it is.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ya.
He has been there a long time.	Ọ nọ n'ebe ahụ ogologo oge.
Quickly, he thought.	Ngwa ngwa, o chere.
Many of those things.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ihe ndị ahụ.
Now, and the problem itself.	Ugbu a, na nsogbu n'onwe ya.
Maybe he didn't know that.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ maghị nke ahụ.
But music is very important.	Ma egwu dị ezigbo mkpa.
The new coffee machine is cheap and easy to use.	Igwe kọfị ọhụrụ ahụ dị ọnụ ala ma dị mfe iji.
Australians now have the right to be angry.	Ndị Australia nwere ikike iwe iwe ugbu a.
The girls are so cute.	Ụmụ agbọghọ ndị ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
I might be a good thing, though.	Enwere m ike ịbụ ezigbo ihe, n'agbanyeghị.
Many, many people have died.	Ọtụtụ mmadụ nwụrụ.
There were no balls or anything.	Enweghị bọọlụ ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
It looks like nothing happened.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ihe merenụ.
I am always busy.	M na-enwe ọrụ mgbe niile.
This is indeed true.	Nke a bụ eziokwu n'ezie.
He has it.	Ọ dị ya.
There are many.	Enwere ọtụtụ.
Everything is a new practice for me.	Ihe niile bụ omume ọhụrụ nye m.
He wants to use it.	Ọ chọrọ iji ya.
It is good that many of our players say the same thing.	Ọ dị mma na ọtụtụ ndị egwuregwu anyị na-ekwu otu ihe ahụ.
What did you do.	Kedu ihe ị mere.
Life after imprisonment was difficult.	Ndụ mgbe a tụrụ mkpọrọ siri ike.
You gave me life.	I nyere m ndụ.
Which is slightly higher than the temperature of the head.	Nke dị ntakịrị karịa okpomọkụ nke isi ahụ.
Human fire is here.	Ọkụ mmadụ dị ebe a.
This is an obvious lie, of course.	Nke a bụ ụgha doro anya, n'ezie.
Still, both factors may be involved.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ihe abụọ a nwere ike ịbụ ihe kpatara ya.
No girlfriend, no wife, nothing like that.	Enweghị enyi nwanyị, enweghị nwunye, ọ nweghị ihe ahụ.
He understood very well, because he knew me well.	Ọ ghọtara nke ọma, n'ihi na ọ maara m nke ọma.
No one asked me a question.	O nweghị onye jụrụ m otu ajụjụ.
Which is my main one.	Nke m bụ isi.
No, we are not alone.	Mba, anyị nọ naanị anyị.
Police officers!	Ndị ọrụ uwe ojii!
Get out of my heart.	Si n'obi m pụọ.
He does it a second time.	Ọ na-eme nke ugboro abụọ.
That's what we are told.	Otú ahụ ka e kwuru anyị.
But that is not for everyone.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị maka onye ọ bụla.
It's cheap.	Ọ dị ọnụ ala.
I hope you are happy.	Enwere m olileanya na obi dị gị ụtọ.
It's worse now.	Ọ ka njọ ugbu a.
You go for what is good.	Ị na-aga na ihe ọ dị mma.
That is the theme of two separate books.	Nke ahụ bụ isi okwu nke akwụkwọ abụọ dị iche iche.
It may be a week or three.	O nwere ike ịbụ otu izu ma ọ bụ izu atọ.
Some of it is mine.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ya bụ nke m.
In fact, they said.	N'ezie, ha kwuru.
It’s just something I should love.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe gbasara m kwesịrị ịhụ n'anya.
Not that they are bad.	Ọ bụghị na ha dị njọ.
It is not.	Ọ bụghị ya.
I am that person.	Abụ m onye ahụ.
If not today, tomorrow, fast.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị taa, echi, ngwa ngwa.
He has a plan for us, you know.	O nwere atụmatụ maka anyị, ị maara.
I can't eat.	Enweghị m ike iri nri.
Just talking to him scared me.	Naanị ịgwa ya okwu tụrụ m ụjọ.
Everyone knows everyone.	Onye ọ bụla maara onye ọ bụla.
The bride made all the food.	Nwunye ahụ mere nri niile.
The house is not far from here.	Ụlọ ahụ adịghị anya site n'ebe a.
I like the way it tastes.	Enwere m mmasị na obi ụtọ ọ na-enwe.
The words are clear, give it to everyone.	Okwu ndị ahụ doro anya, nye ya na mmadụ niile.
He was born well.	Ọ mụrụ ya nke ọma.
He tries to do this whenever possible.	Ọ na-agbalị ime nke a mgbe ọ bụla o kwere omume.
You are afraid of yourself, your family, and your friends.	Ị na-atụ onwe gị egwu, na ezinụlọ gị, na ndị enyi gị.
Now her eyes are like water and far away.	Ugbu a, anya ya dị ka mmiri ma dị anya.
He never looked at me.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ lere m anya n'anya.
There is music.	Egwu dị.
I think both are true.	Echere m na ha abụọ bụ eziokwu.
He would have been a leader.	Ọ gaara abụ onye isi.
That was about four years ago.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe dị ka afọ anọ gara aga.
But no one else was around.	Ma ọ dịghị onye ọzọ nọ nso.
His work is simple.	Ọrụ ya dị mfe.
Or we, either.	Ma ọ bụ anyị, ma.
Only a few are interested.	Naanị ole na ole nwere mmasị.
That really happened.	Nke ahụ mere n'ezie.
The passengers arrived early this morning.	Ndị njem ahụ bịara n'isi ụtụtụ a.
The boy pointed to the photo.	Nwata nwoke ahụ tụrụ aka na foto.
It is the same application.	Ọ bụ otu ngwa ahụ.
At the same time there are challenges.	N'otu oge ahụ enwere ihe ịma aka.
One and the most.	Otu na kacha.
We can't have one without you.	Anyị enweghị ike inwe otu na-enweghị gị.
This really scared me.	Nke a tụrụ m egwu n'ezie.
We went back a long way, they said.	Anyị gara azụ ogologo ụzọ, ha kwuru.
I looked at it.	M lere ya anya.
It is good news.	Ọ bụ ozi ọma.
The best of them wore boat shoes.	Ndị kacha mma n'ime ha yi akpụkpọ ụkwụ ụgbọ mmiri.
We thought it worked well.	Anyị chere na ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Each person was given a booklet.	Mmadụ nyere ha nke ọ bụla akwụkwọ nta.
Likewise, it cannot.	N'otu aka ahụ, ọ nweghị ike.
There are several reasons for this.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara nke a.
all of you.	unu niile.
His truthfulness speaks for itself.	Eziokwu ya kwuru n'onwe ha.
It really is there.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ebe ahụ.
But the other two are clearly infinite.	Mana abụọ ndị ọzọ doro anya na enweghị oke.
But sometimes some of your runners have that kind of time.	Ma mgbe ụfọdụ ndị na-agba ọsọ gị na-enwe oge dị otú ahụ.
The issue is hard to follow.	Okwu ahụ siri ike iso.
The journey is beyond your reach.	Njem ahụ karịrị gị oke.
Maybe you are.	Eleghị anya ị bụ.
Continuing the story is not good.	Ịga n'ihu akụkọ adịghị mma.
He did not know how proud he was.	Ọ maghị ókè ịnya isi ya.
My house is 20 minutes away.	Ụlọ m dị nkeji iri abụọ n'ebe a.
You can stay.	Ị nwere ike ịnọ.
I really, really, look forward to that.	M n'ezie, n'ezie, na-atụ anya otú ahụ.
You get a plane.	Ị nweta ụgbọ elu.
So far, nothing has happened.	Ruo ugbu a, ọ nweghị ihe.
You can talk to me all the time.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa m okwu mgbe niile.
He had always felt that way and now he was sure.	Ọ na-eche otú ahụ mgbe ọ bụla ma ugbu a, o ji n'aka.
But it will not travel far.	Ma ọ gaghị agba ebe dị anya.
You will have some tomorrow.	Ị ga-enwe ụfọdụ echi.
You’ll be faster, but not too fast.	Ị ga-adị ngwa ngwa, mana ọ bụghị oke ngwa ngwa.
This is the way to do both.	Nke a bụ ụzọ ime ha abụọ.
I have important things to do.	Enwere m ihe ndị dị mkpa m ga-eme.
Here is one simple thing you can do.	Nke a bụ otu ihe dị mfe ị nwere ike ime.
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, ha emeghị.
This will be my destination now.	Nke a ga-abụ ebe m ga-aga ugbu a.
He does it every day.	Ọ na-eme ya kwa ụbọchị.
We owe it.	Anyị ji ụgwọ.
Can't find you.	Enweghị ike ịchọta gị.
He knew her as if she did not know others.	Ọ maara ya dị ka ọ maghị ndị ọzọ.
Please give your mother these medicines.	Biko nye nne gị ọgwụ ndị a.
It feels so bad.	Ọ dị ya ka ọ̀ bụ ihe ọjọọ.
The question is serious, but important.	Ajụjụ dị egwu, mana ọ dị mkpa.
He deserves it well.	O kwesịrị ya nke ọma.
You know it.	Ị maara ya.
It is still very tasty.	Ọ ka na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
These bosses like the negative.	Ndị isi a na-amasị ihe na-adịghị mma.
Because he knew.	N'ihi na ọ maara.
He wants you to be there for the interview tomorrow morning, anyway.	Ọ chọrọ ka ị nọrọ ebe ahụ maka ajụjụ ọnụ n'ụtụtụ echi, n'agbanyeghị.
There is a problem here.	Otu nsogbu dị ebe a.
So, let's hurry.	Ya mere, ka anyị mee ngwa ngwa.
It is a condition of being.	Ọ bụ ọnọdụ nke ịbụ.
Now let’s see what I got.	Ugbu a ka anyị hụ ihe m nwetara.
She had no children.	O nweghị ụmụ.
He put his hand on his heart.	O tinyere aka ya n'obi ya.
You can see what can happen, power.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ihe nwere ike ime, ike.
I was an awesome swimmer.	Abụ m onye igwu mmiri dị egwu.
But of course it is never really new.	Ma n'ezie ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bụla dị ọhụrụ n'ezie.
I think about you always think about you.	M na-eche banyere gị mgbe niile na-eche banyere gị.
They both do not use the same method.	Ha abụọ anaghị eji otu ụzọ.
But the drugs are coming.	Ma ọgwụ ndị ahụ na-abịa.
His life will not be like that.	Ndụ ya agaghị adị otú ahụ.
But this is an important point.	Ma nke a bụ isi ihe bara uru.
There are two possible reasons.	E nwere ihe abụọ kpatara ya.
Still, it would not be so bad.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ gaghị adị njọ otú ahụ.
But that is what we are called.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe a kpọrọ anyị.
Thank you very much!	Daalụ nke ukwuu!
Enjoy.	Na-atọ ụtọ ụtọ.
Not today alone.	Ọ bụghị taa naanị.
No one is happy.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere obi ụtọ.
I was wondering if it was the same.	M nọ na-eche ma ọ̀ bụ otu.
Within two minutes, the police were on the scene.	N'ime nkeji abụọ, ndị uwe ojii nọ ebe ahụ.
This is useful now.	Nke a bara uru ugbu a.
Do it for yourself.	Mee ya maka onwe gị.
You are my son, he said.	Ị bụ nwa m nwoke, o kwuru.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.
Unlike most journalists.	Ọ dịghị ka ọtụtụ ndị nta akụkọ.
Within two minutes, they were all drowned.	N'ime nkeji abụọ, mmiri riri ha niile.
I want to help you.	Achọrọ m inyere gị aka.
The team played a tough game.	Ndị otu ahụ mere egwuregwu siri ike.
But none of them are close by.	Ma ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha nọ nso.
I use my company name.	Eji m aha ụlọ ọrụ m.
And about time.	Na banyere oge.
Nothing really happened.	Ọ dịghị ihe mere n'ezie.
It seems like a good idea at first.	Ọ dị ka ọ bụ atụmatụ bara uru na mbụ.
It’s real, it’s feminine, not character.	Ọ dị adị, ọ bụ nwanyị, ọ bụghị agwa.
When the car stops, look for a better way.	Mgbe ụgbọ ala ahụ kwụsịrị, chọọ ụzọ dị mma.
He should know very well.	O kwesịrị ịma nke ọma.
He is very surprised.	Anya juru ya anya nke ukwuu.
Nothing was done.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla e mere.
He said a few words and left.	O kwuru okwu ole na ole wee pụọ.
It's too bad.	Ọ dị oke njọ.
In the event.	Na ihe omume.
Still, not everything is going well.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ bụghị ihe niile na-aga.
We know we are just meat now.	Anyị maara na anyị bụ naanị anụ ugbu a.
Then he told her he was going backwards.	Mgbe ahụ ọ gwara ya na ya na-aga azụ.
That is a good idea.	Nke ahụ bụ ezigbo echiche.
Some women still do it.	Ụfọdụ ụmụ nwanyị ka na-eme ya.
The water is very strong.	Mmiri ahụ siri ezigbo ike.
Go here.	Gaa ebe a.
He did the best he could.	O ji ike ya mee ihe ọma.
I can’t believe it was so beautiful.	Enweghị m ike ikweta na ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
He’s just kidding.	Ọ na-egwu egwu.
Of the company.	Nke ụlọ ọrụ.
That's it.	Ọ bụ ya.
It can be different for different people.	Ọ nwere ike ịbụ ihe dị iche iche maka ndị dị iche iche.
For me, it was really different.	Maka m, ọ bụ n'ezie iche.
I was alone in his house.	Mụ na ya nọ naanị n'ụlọ ya.
A test of courage.	Ule nke obi ike.
I do not understand.	Aghọtaghị m.
He really liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
And this should be easy.	Na nke a kwesịrị ịdị mfe.

You read everything.	Ị na-agụ ihe niile.
But we were really close.	Ma, n'ezie, anyị bịara nnọọ nso.
This is really scary.	Nke a dị egwu n'ezie.
Go for it.	Gaa na ya.
Not in shoes.	Ọ bụghị na akpụkpọ ụkwụ.
Of course, there are many more.	N'ezie, e nwere ọtụtụ ihe ndị ọzọ.

The house is beautiful and tidy.	Ụlọ ahụ mara mma ma dị mma.
I would like to go to the beach.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịga osimiri.
It seems to me.	Ọ dị m ka.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
That is, there is something wrong with that.	Ya bụ, o nwere ihe adịghị njọ na nke ahụ.
The door slammed shut.	Ọnụ ụzọ ahụ kwụsịrị ka ha banyere.
It's not a game.	Ọ bụghị egwuregwu.
Good thing it will be with me for a month.	Ihe dị mma ọ ga-anọ m otu ọnwa.

She knows her father better than anyone else.	Ọ ma nna ya karịa onye ọ bụla.

There are, at least, questions about their cruelty.	Enwere, ma ọ bụrụ na ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, ajụjụ banyere obi ọjọọ ha.
That is what happened here.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe mere ebe a.

The worst part is the fight.	Ihe kacha njọ kpatara ọgụ.

He asked many questions during that time.	Ọ jụrụ ọtụtụ ajụjụ n'oge ahụ.
Everyone wants to say one last word.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ ikwu okwu nke ikpeazụ.

Then my mother stopped crying.	Nne m kwụsịrị ibe ákwá mgbe ahụ.
They went to the window.	Ha gara na windo.
The president spoke to the nation.	Onye isi ala gwara mba ahụ okwu.
You should do this early in the morning.	I kwesịrị ime nke a n'isi ụtụtụ.
They hate us and go on no matter what we do.	Ha kpọrọ anyị asị ma na-aga n’agbanyeghị ihe anyị na-eme.

And for your friends.	Na n'ihi na ibe gị.
Otherwise, it still works fine.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ ka na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.

He looked at it carefully.	O lere ya anya nke ọma.
I'm not sure if any of that is true.	Ejighị m n'aka na nke ọ bụla n'ime nke ahụ bụ eziokwu.
For many athletes, this is true.	Maka ọtụtụ ndị egwuregwu, nke a bụ eziokwu.
No more room space.	Enweghị ohere ụlọ ọzọ.
Whether we realize it or not.	Ma anyị ghọtara ma ọ bụ na anyị amaghị.
Humans do things.	Ụmụ mmadụ na-eme ihe.
That will only happen the first time you run the application.	Nke ahụ ga-eme naanị oge mbụ ị na-eme ngwa ahụ.
But the big question is these.	Mana nnukwu ajụjụ bụ ndị a.

However, sometimes.	Otú ọ dị, mgbe ụfọdụ.
They are both about the same size.	Ha abụọ dị ihe dị ka otu ibu.
Almost everything goes well without it.	Ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ihe niile na-aga nke ọma na-enweghị ya.
Otherwise, you will have a huge task.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ị ga-enwe nnukwu ọrụ.
Let them stay home.	Ka ha nọrọ n'ụlọ.
I'm really happy, to be honest.	Enwere m obi ụtọ n'ezie, ikwu eziokwu.

You need to eat different foods.	I kwesịrị iri nri dị iche iche.
Now you can see me, wherever you are.	Ugbu a ị nwere ike ịhụ m, ebe ọ bụla ị nọ.
Things are different here.	Ihe dị iche ebe a.

You, and those girls are cheap.	Gị, na ụmụ agbọghọ ndị ahụ dị ọnụ ala.
That was enough for me.	Nke ahụ zuru m.
This is the last book of this story.	Nke a bụ akwụkwọ ikpeazụ nke akụkọ a.

Something different is happening.	Ihe dị iche na-eme.
Not that he really gave anything.	Ọ bụghị na o nyere ihe ọ bụla n'ezie.
Of course, the worst.	N'ezie, nke kacha njọ.
So they are one thing indeed.	Ya mere, ha bụ otu ihe n'ezie.

Now the problem is this.	Ugbu a nsogbu bụ nke a.
He loved his job.	Ọ hụrụ ọrụ ya n'anya.
So it’s hard.	Ya mere o siri ike.
First, you will need three beds.	Mbụ, ị ga-achọ akwa atọ.
I'm really good.	Adị m mma n'ezie.
Not a challenge but not an easy one.	Ọ bụghị ihe ịma aka mana ọ dịghị mfe.

I was surprised that the food was delicious.	O juru m anya na nri ahụ dị ụtọ.
You know, a boat needs water.	Ị mara, ụgbọ mmiri chọrọ mmiri.
The women quickly left the building.	Ụmụ nwanyị hapụrụ ụlọ ahụ ngwa ngwa.
Other points are always key.	Isi ihe ndị ọzọ bụ isi ihe mgbe niile.
They started the same day.	Ha malitere otu ụbọchị ahụ.

The ride itself is pretty cool.	Ịnya ụgbọ ahụ n'onwe ya dị ezigbo mma.
But that sounds really good to me.	Mana nke ahụ dị m mma n'ezie.
We only talk on the phone, do it that way.	Anyị na-ekwu naanị na ekwentị, mee ya otú ahụ.
The maximum value in the ground.	Uru kacha n'ime ala.
But sadly, there is some truth in that.	Mana ọ dị nwute, enwere ụfọdụ eziokwu na nke ahụ.
To have a community, you have to have limits.	Iji nwee obodo, ị ga-enwe oke.
Or so he said.	Ma ọ bụ otú ahụ o kwuru.

We do not look at each other.	Anyị eleghị ibe anyị anya.
There is a challenge there but he knows it.	Enwere ihe ịma aka n'ebe ahụ ma ọ maara ya.
In terms of value.	N'ihe gbasara uru.
Apparently he was still alive.	O doro anya na ọ ka dị ndụ.
This offer is only for a limited time.	Onyinye a dị naanị obere oge.
Then great again.	Mgbe ahụ dị ukwuu ọzọ.

He is the man who made you think.	Ọ bụ nwoke mere ka ị na-eche.
They can be found quickly for what they really are.	Enwere ike ịchọta ha ngwa ngwa maka ihe ha bụ n'ezie.
That's a little bit.	Nke ahụ dị ntakịrị.
He told us it was good to stay home.	Ọ gwara anyị na ọ dị mma ịnọ n'ụlọ.
The woman will not like them.	Nwanyị ahụ agaghị enwe mmasị n'ebe ha nọ.
This has been the case in the past.	Ọ dị otu a n'oge gara aga.
No, there is no way.	Mba, enweghị ụzọ.

There are only two buildings currently under construction.	Enwere naanị ụlọ abụọ a na-arụ ugbu a.
We are both very happy about it.	Anyị abụọ nwere nnọọ obi ụtọ banyere ya.

It is not well known in the city.	A maghị ya nke ọma n'ime obodo ahụ.
Unfortunately it does not work.	Ọ dị nwute na ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.

Far from anything.	N'ebe dị anya na ihe ọ bụla.
I wondered what he wanted me to do.	M nọ na-eche ihe ọ chọrọ ka m chọọ.
He did not know why he had done this to himself.	Ọ maghị ihe mere o ji mee onwe ya ihe a.
That is his job.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ ya.
But it is the best thing he can do.	Ma, ọ bụ ihe kacha mma o nwere ike ime.
They do not, but you do not know.	Ha anaghị eme, mana ị maghị.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
But the rules vary from place to place.	Mana iwu ndị ahụ dị iche site n'otu ebe ruo ebe.
He liked the book.	Akwụkwọ ahụ masịrị ya.
Nothing about my life seems to exist.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla banyere ndụ m yiri ka ọ dị adị.
It is just to find.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ịchọta.
However, it is not the same bad thing.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị otu ụdị ihe ọjọọ ahụ.
You fell into something like that.	Ị dara na ihe dị otú ahụ.

I'm sure many of these are beautiful.	Eji m n'aka na ọtụtụ n'ime ndị a mara mma.

Who is a black woman?	Kedu onye bụ nwanyị ojii?

In many respects.	N'ime ọtụtụ ihe.

It should be fun.	O kwesịrị ka ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
So, what can we do about them?	Ya mere, gịnị ka anyị pụrụ ime banyere ha?
The weather is beautiful today.	Ihu igwe mara mma taa.
You can go as far as your mind allows.	Ị nwere ike ịga ruo ka uche gị kwere gị.
He looks like a prince or a chief.	Ọ dị ka onye isi ma ọ bụ onye isi.
He was in prison when his mother died.	Ọ nọ n’ụlọ mkpọrọ mgbe nne ya nwụrụ.
We should use the little essentials.	Anyị kwesịrị iji obere ihe ndị dị mkpa mee ihe.
He really thought it was him.	O chere nnọọ na ọ bụ ya.
Of course that is the law.	N'ezie nke ahụ bụ iwu.
But we are very close friends.	Ma anyị bụ nnọọ ezigbo enyi.

They were born many years apart.	A mụrụ ha ọtụtụ afọ iche.
And another thing he can't name.	Na ihe ọzọ ọ na-enweghị ike ịkpọ aha.
The point is that nothing is clear now.	Isi ihe bụ na ọ nweghị ihe doro anya ugbu a.
They have only each other, whether they like it or not.	Ha nwere naanị ibe ha, ma ọ masịrị ha ma ọ bụ na ha achọghị.
He wanted more than that in his life.	Ọ chọrọ karịa nke ahụ na ndụ ya.

He is a good actor.	Ọ bụ ezigbo onye na-eme ihe nkiri.

There is a negative feeling in the body right now.	Enwere mmetụta na-adịghị mma n'ime otu ahụ ugbu a.
Now it looks like he's there.	Ugbu a, ọ dị ka ọ nọ ebe ahụ.

He did not want to tell his parents.	Ọ chọghị ịgwa ndị mụrụ ya.

The man had big ears.	Nwoke ahụ nwere nnukwu ntị.
My wife looked at our daughter.	Nwunye m lere nwa anyị nwanyị anya.
She was terrified of the upcoming test.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya maka ule na-abịa.
But this is nothing new to them.	Ma nke a abụghị ihe ọhụrụ nye ha.
Nothing is going well tonight.	Ọ dịghị ihe na-aga nke ọma n'abalị a.

But of course, it is very good.	Ma n'ezie, ọ dị ezigbo mma.
This is what he did, think about it.	Nke a bụ ihe o mere ya, na-eche banyere ya.

Of course it can.	N'ezie ọ nwere ike.

You can not follow them.	Ị nweghị ike iso ha.

They have just started to leave.	Ha ka malitere ịpụ.
But that doesn't work.	Mana nke ahụ anaghị arụ ọrụ.

She seems to be unwell.	Ọ dị ka ahụ adịghị ya mma.
He was amazed.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.
More things will come soon.	Ihe ndị ọzọ ga-abịa n'ụzọ doro anya.
It makes people happy about who they are.	Ọ na-eme ka obi dị ndị mmadụ ụtọ maka ụdị onye ha bụ.
She loves her granddaughter.	Ọ hụrụ nwa nwa ya n'anya.
It was as if he and two other people were gone.	Ọ dị nnọọ ka ya na mmadụ abụọ ọzọ pụọ.
You can take a break once in a while.	Ị nwere ike iri ezumike otu ugboro n'otu oge.

He could not see anything.	Ọ nweghị ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla.

See work, employees, work environment.	Hụ ọrụ, ndị ọrụ, gburugburu ebe ọrụ.
We are happy to see them.	Obi adịghị anyị ụtọ ịhụ ha.
This is a job market that doesn’t work very well.	Nke a bụ ahịa ọrụ anaghị arụ ọrụ nke ukwuu.
I want to tell you something.	Achọrọ m ịgwa gị ihe.
It will be difficult.	Ọ ga-abụ nke siri ike.

They are so good and so good.	Ha dị oke mma na nke ọma.
I know it is not.	Ama m na ọ bụghị.
But now it is summer again.	Ma ugbu a, ọ bụ oge okpomọkụ ọzọ.
Things just to give them a sense of place.	Ihe naanị iji nye ha mmetụta nke ebe ahụ.

He made a feast.	O mere oriri.
Great anger.	Iwe dị ukwuu.
She did not understand.	Aghọtaghị ya.
This is their place, not mine.	Nke a bụ ebe ha, ọ bụghị nke m.
The drinks were a bad idea.	Ihe ọṅụṅụ ndị ahụ bụ echiche ọjọọ.
Now, things will be different.	Ugbu a, ihe ga-adị iche.
No one else is there.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ n'ebe ahụ.
I like this plane.	Ụgbọ elu a masịrị m.
These drinks are not good for the family.	Ihe ọṅụṅụ ndị a adịghị mma maka ezinụlọ.
If he succeeds, he may be ready to go.	Ọ bụrụ na o mee nke ọma, o nwere ike ịdị njikere ime njem.
It is not just the church.	Ọ bụghị naanị ụka.
Last destination uncertain.	Ebe ikpeazụ ejighị n'aka.
Apparently they were on a school trip.	O doro anya na ha nọ na njem ụlọ akwụkwọ.
He never lived.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ dị ndụ.
I want you to be happy that you are happy here.	Achọrọ m ka ị nwee obi ụtọ na ị na-enwe obi ụtọ ebe a.
What he said was wrong.	O doro anya na ihe o kwuru abụghị eziokwu.
You just have to be ready for everything.	Naanị ị ga-adị njikere maka ihe niile.
But they could not help themselves.	Ma ha enweghị ike inyere onwe ha aka.
He was very unhappy, but he had nothing to go on.	Obi adịghị ya ụtọ nke ukwuu, mana ọ nweghị ihe ọ ga-aga n'ihu.
Tell me.	Gwa m.
Water on time.	Mmiri na oge.

I have two of them.	Enwere m abụọ n'ime ha.
I saw this place the other day.	Ahụrụ m ebe a ụbọchị ọzọ.
He did not want to talk about his family.	Ọ chọghị ikwu banyere ezinụlọ ya.
They will do it.	Ha ga-eme ya.
Hard time, of course.	Oge siri ike, n'ezie.
They have one daughter.	Ha nwere otu nwa nwanyị.
Nothing but this.	Ọ dịghị ihe ma nke a.
This man owes.	Nwoke a ji ụgwọ.
There is so much to do.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe ime.
Her baby died at the age of four months.	Nwa ya nwụrụ n'ọnwa anọ ya.
They want to play.	Ha chọrọ igwu egwu.
He is in you.	Ọ nọ n'ime gị.
Maybe you did.	Ma eleghị anya, i mere.
You can not help anyone.	Ị nweghị ike inyere onye ọ bụla aka.
But we saw each other.	Ma anyị hụrụ ibe anyị.
We are a large family.	Anyị bụ otu nnukwu ezinụlọ.
The song is old, but the "words" are not.	Abụ ahụ bụ oge ochie, mana "okwu" abụghị.
That’s what he wants more.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ chọrọ karịa.
I could see that he was nervous.	Enwere m ike ịhụ na ụjọ na-atụ ya.
That’s awesome, boy.	Nke ahụ dị egwu, nwa nwoke.
He met a beautiful woman.	Ọ hụrụ otu nwanyị mara mma.
He has a different plan.	O nwere atụmatụ dị iche.
During this operation.	N'oge ọrụ a.
What is the time?	Gịnị bụ oge?
He doesn't care now.	Ọ chọghị ịma ugbu a.
Let others know why you think so.	Mee ka ndị ọzọ mara mkpa ị chere ihe kpatara ya.
He spent many days trying to find his way.	Ọ nọrọ ọtụtụ ụbọchị na-agbalị ịchọta ụzọ ya.
It seems they understood.	Ọ dị ka ha ghọtara.
I do not care about.	Achọghị m ịma maka ya.
It almost happened a few years ago.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka o mee afọ ole na ole gara aga.
It was the same before.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị na mbụ.

I love a lot of things.	Ahụrụ m ọtụtụ ihe n'anya.
Only I can help me.	Ọ bụ naanị m nwere ike inyere m aka.
In fact, they are trying to help him.	N'ezie, ha na-agbalị inyere ya aka.
Thank you	Daalụ
The only question is when and how.	Naanị ajụjụ bụ mgbe na otú.
I met him at his house.	M zutere ya n'ụlọ ya.
About the same thing as the backyard.	Ihe dị ka otu ihe dị ka azụ ụlọ.
When was the last time you saw me?	Kedu mgbe ikpeazụ ị hụrụ m?
As you wish.	Dị ka ị chọrọ.
He does not seem to be feeling well.	O yighị ka o chere na ọ dị mma.
But that's all I'm saying.	Mana nke ahụ bụ naanị m na-ekwu.
Nothing seems to be happening.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla yiri ka ọ na-eme.
Otherwise.	Ma ọ bụghị ya.
But it is easy.	Ma ọ dị mfe.
But there is a problem.	Ma enwere nsogbu.
He would have "had lunch" for this.	Ọ "gaara nri ehihie" maka nke a.
For again, it's all about how we look.	N'ihi na ọzọ, ọ bụ ihe niile banyere otú anyị anya.
But obviously that is difficult.	Mana o doro anya na nke ahụ siri ike.
In fact, he went out.	Nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na ọ pụọ.
This is actually happening.	Nke a na-eme n'ezie.
They took advantage of the challenge.	Ha ji ihe ịma aka ahụ mee ihe bara uru.
There is no place like home.	O nweghị ebe dị ka ụlọ.
That is why we are.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe mere anyị ji bụrụ.
The film lasted a few weeks.	Ihe nkiri ahụ gbara izu ole na ole.
I will use it in only one situation though.	M ga-eji ya na naanị otu ọnọdụ n'agbanyeghị.
But whether the feeling is big or small, it is definitely good.	Ma ma mmetụta ọ bụ nnukwu ma ọ bụ obere, o doro anya na ọ dị mma.
Drink water, eat food, rest.	Na-aṅụ mmiri, rie nri, zuru ike.
In the ear.	Na ntị.
I was born for this.	A mụrụ m maka nke a.
The car pulled away.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ wee pụọ ebe ahụ.
It is made of wood.	E ji osisi mee ya.
But it may not be for everyone.	Mana ọ nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ maka mmadụ niile.
I will cook.	Aga m esi nri.
I burned something.	M gbara ihe ọkụ.
However, that is not a question of certainty.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ abụghị ajụjụ dị n'aka.
I was the last one they wanted around.	Abụ m onye ikpeazụ ha chọrọ gburugburu.
Not your problem.	Ọ bụghị nsogbu gị.
We hope this will never happen again.	Anyị nwere olileanya na nke a agaghị eme ọzọ.
Most kids can do this in a matter of minutes.	Ọtụtụ ụmụaka nwere ike ime nke a n'ime nkeji nkeji.
Before the wine.	Tupu mmanya.
He didn't really want to talk about it.	Ọ chọghị n'ezie ikwu banyere ya.
He desperately wants to see you again.	Ọ chọrọ nke ukwuu ịhụ gị ọzọ.
He loves our community and our people.	Ọ hụrụ obodo anyị na ndị anyị n'anya.
His game ability is awesome.	Ikike egwuregwu ya dị egwu.
So it goes.	Ya mere, ọ na-aga.
Therefore, it will be the same in itself.	Ya mere, ọ ga-abụ otu n'onwe ya.
I use it sometimes for cooking.	Ana m eji ya esi nri mgbe ụfọdụ.
This gave her hope.	Nke a mere ka o nwee olileanya.
Can you help me with this?	Ị nwere ike inye m aka na nke a?
They were angry at that.	Ha were iwe na nke ahụ.
However, this approach has its drawbacks.	Otú ọ dị, ụzọ a nwere nsogbu.
I like to see them there.	Ọ na-amasị m ịhụ ha n'ebe ahụ.
He really liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
He made it worse than himself.	O mere ya ka ọ dị njọ ka ya onwe ya.
That should not be the case.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka ọ kwesịrị ịdị.
The building is very different from its surroundings.	Ụlọ ahụ dị nnọọ iche na gburugburu ya.
He just left.	Ọ dị nnọọ pụọ.
Nothing, ever.	Ọ dịghị ihe, na mgbe.
But there is something important happening here.	Mana enwere ihe dị mkpa na-eme ebe a.
The idea is beautiful.	Echiche ahụ mara mma.
I do not belong to anyone.	Adịghị m nke onye ọ bụla.
I am not alone.	Ọ bụghị naanị m.
You do not have to do it every day.	Ọ dịghị ka ị ga-eme ya kwa ụbọchị.
She begins to cry.	Ọ malitere ibe ákwá.
Not a big deal.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu ihe.
The city has some big problems.	Obodo nwere ụfọdụ nnukwu nsogbu.
Everyone should do their best to get out.	Onye ọ bụla kwesịrị ime ike ya niile ka ọ pụọ.
She is not a real baby.	Ọ bụghị nwa ọhụrụ n'ezie.
Money, for the most part, is what we want.	Ego, nke ka ukwuu, bụ ihe anyị chọrọ.
One in front of him and one behind.	Otu n'ihu ya na otu n'azụ.
It can work.	O nwere ike na-arụ ọrụ.
There is so much to see.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe ịhụ.
They know what they are and what they are doing.	Ha maara ihe ha bụ na ihe ha na-eme.
He knew what was happening.	Ọ ma na ihe na-eme.
You used those words.	Okwu ndị ahụ ka i ji mee ihe.
They are terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ ha nke ukwuu.
Do what you dread often.	Mee ihe ahụ ị na-atụ egwu ugboro ugboro.
Do you think we should go there?	Ị chere na anyị kwesịrị ịga ebe ahụ?
They had such a great sense of humor.	Ha nwere oke ọchị dị otú ahụ.

The fish are now doing things over and over again.	Azụ na-eme ihe ugbu a ugboro ugboro.
I do not have it.	Enweghị m ya.
I'll fire.	Aga m agba ọkụ.
Everyone in the hall finished what they were doing and thought.	Ndị niile nọ n’ụlọ nzukọ ahụ mechara ihe ha na-eme wee chere.
If anything happens to you, please let me know.	Ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla mere gị, biko mee ka m mara.
I know you are a boy.	Ama m na ị bụ nwa nwoke.
By this he did.	Site na nke a o mere.
We made it necessary for them.	Anyị mere ka ọ dị ha mkpa.
It can be.	O nwere ike ịbụ.
He probably did not have time to leave.	Ọ ga-abụ na o nweghị oge ọ ga-eji pụọ.
This is the first time.	Nke a bụ nke mbụ.
He knows the truth.	Ọ ma nke bụ́ eziokwu.
You just have to do it.	Naanị ị ga-eme ya.
We never do.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị na-eme.
Another man was by the side of the passengers.	Nwoke ọzọ nọ n'akụkụ ndị njem.
The two cars collided for several minutes.	Ụgbọ ala abụọ ahụ gbara n'akụkụ ibe ha ruo ọtụtụ nkeji.
I'm not pregnant right now.	Adịghị m ime ugbu a.
I have something in my mouth.	Enwere m ihe n'ọnụ m.
You heard big words.	Ị nụrụ nnukwu okwu.
What are you doing tonight?	Kedu ihe ị na-eme n'abalị a?
He has none.	O nweghị nke ọ bụla.
They fell so hard.	Ha dara nke ukwuu.
There is no time to do it.	Enweghị ogologo oge ime ya.
But it will happen.	Ma ọ ga-eme.
It works this way.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ otu a.
It is a message.	Ọ bụ ozi.
She has a funny face.	O nwere ihu ọchị.
Only then, however.	Naanị mgbe ahụ, Otú ọ dị.
There are so many things.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe.
This new method is awesome!	Ụzọ ọhụrụ a dị egwu!
I don’t want it to be me.	Achọghị m ka ọ bụrụ m.
Give customers what they want.	Nye ndị ahịa ihe ha chọrọ.

It’s a fun little movie.	Ọ bụ obere ihe nkiri na-atọ ụtọ.

Not me, everyone wants me to be.	Ọ bụghị m, onye ọ bụla chọrọ ka m bụrụ.

You are the color of fire.	Ị bụ agba nke ọkụ.
It was there that they first met.	Ọ bụ ebe ahụ ka ha zutere na mbụ.
But it will be a week.	Ma, ọ ga-abụ otu izu.
It can be anything.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọ bụla.
That expects a game today.	Nke ahụ na-atụ anya egwuregwu taa.
I need to get out.	Ekwesịrị m ịpụ.
But there are many things that will make you happy.	Mana enwere ọtụtụ ihe ga-eme gị obi ụtọ.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
He could not say anything else.	Ọ nweghị ike ikwu ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
This drink is delicious.	Ihe ọṅụṅụ a na-atọ ụtọ.
Last year we were angry.	N'afọ gara aga, iwe were anyị.
Or think you are doing it.	Ma ọ bụ chere na ị na-eme ya.
The other power point is limited, now.	Ebe ike ọzọ nwere oke, ugbu a.
No problem, we are happy to do it.	Enweghị nsogbu, anyị nwere obi ụtọ ime ya.
Good customers have nothing but the truth is on their side.	Ezigbo ndị ahịa enweghị ihe ọ bụla ma eziokwu dị n'akụkụ ha.
Promises are personal.	Nkwa bụ nke onwe.
Or in it.	Ma ọ bụ na ya.
Someone is coming.	Mmadụ na-abịa.
Bad, pointless, and unhealthy.	Dị njọ, enweghị isi, ma na-adịghị mma.
But of course it did, when he met you.	Ma n'ezie ọ mere, mgbe ọ zutere gị.
I am enthusiastic.	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu.
For one thing.	Maka otu ihe.
Just three weeks to wait.	Naanị izu atọ iji chere.
They may love you.	Ha nwere ike ịhụ gị n'anya.
You are a good person and a good doctor.	Ị bụ ezigbo mmadụ na ezigbo dọkịta.
But he is not a real person.	Ma ọ bụghị onye nwere ezi ike.
He really liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
We are not the company anyway.	Anyị abụghị ụlọ ọrụ ahụ n'agbanyeghị.
The house is beautiful.	Ụlọ ahụ mara mma.
Nor should it happen.	Ma ọ bụ kwesịrị na-eme.
These toys are very fun.	Ihe egwuregwu ụmụaka a na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
This is what keeps us going.	Nke a bụ ihe na-eme ka anyị na-aga.
It was week to week.	Ọ bụ izu ruo izu.

Far away, but not out.	N'ebe dị anya, ma ọ bụghị pụọ.
It was a terrifying night.	Ọ bụ abalị dị oke egwu.

Men do not understand.	Ụmụ nwoke aghọtaghị.
He went fast.	Ọ gara ngwa ngwa.

The reason is mine.	Ihe kpatara ya bụ nke m.
I walk to the back of my house.	M na-aga n'azụ ụlọ m.
There is a lot going on.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe na-aga n'ihu.
He did not want one or the other.	Ọ chọghị otu ma ọ bụ nke ọzọ.
But, of course, perfect sleep.	Ma, n'ezie, ụra zuru oke.
It's better.	Ọ ka mma.
Maybe my father's name will be on it.	Ma eleghị anya, aha nna m ga-adị na ya.
It does not differ from any other day.	Ọ dịghị iche na ụbọchị ọ bụla ọzọ.
He stole everyone's money.	O zuru ego onye ọ bụla.
I have a good feeling.	Enwere m mmetụta dị mma.

It is the first time he has mentioned his first name.	Ọ bụ nke mbụ ọ kpọrọ aha mbụ ya.
I was waiting for him to come.	Anọ m na-eche ka ọ bịa.
River eyes.	Anya osimiri.
Cold night.	Abalị oyi na-atụ.
It's beautiful, too.	Ọ mara mma, kwa.
Everything looked more than it really was.	Ihe niile lere anya karịa ka ọ dị adị.
This market is small.	Ahịa a dị obere.
He did not know them or fear them.	Ọ maghị ha ma ọ bụ egwu ha.
What they do.	Ihe ha na-eme.
I hope someone can help me move forward here.	Enwere m olileanya na mmadụ nwere ike inyere m aka ịga n'ihu ebe a.
It was a great day.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ụbọchị.
Beautiful book.	Akwụkwọ mara mma.

Maybe this time he will have a favor.	Ma eleghị anya na oge a ọ ga-enwe ihu ọma.
But two things.	Ma ihe abụọ.
Not that you don't know.	Ọ bụghị na ị gaghị ama.
The first one she likes.	Nke mbụ na-amasị ya.
He had children.	O nwetara ụmụaka.
My mind is my own church.	Uche m bụ ụka nke m.
Every good friend of mine for many years.	Ọ bụla ezigbo enyi m kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
One two three.	Otu abụọ Atọ.
The company would not be able to function without them.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ agaghị aga n'ihu na-enweghị ha.
They may or may not be good users of the app.	Ha nwere ike ma ọ bụ ghara ịbụ ezigbo ndị ọrụ nke ngwa ahụ.
There seems to be no perfect way to do it.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ụzọ zuru oke iji mee ya.
I want you for that.	Achọrọ m gị nke ahụ.
He put himself in the room.	O tinyere onwe ya n'ime ụlọ.
You did well.	I mere nke ọma.
This may not be real.	Nke a enweghị ike ịbụ ezigbo.
There are many of them there.	E nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha n'ebe ahụ.
You can go now, if you like.	Ị nwere ike ịga ugbu a, ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị.
These are very bad.	Ndị a dị nnọọ njọ.
We do not know what to do then.	Anyị amaghị ihe anyị ga-eme ya mgbe ahụ.
We can not see his face.	Anyị enweghị ike ịhụ ihu ya.
He took the money from his friend.	O were ego n'aka enyi ya.

His father died a long time ago.	Nna ya nwụrụ ogologo oge gara aga.
Not that kind.	Ọ bụghị ụdị ahụ.
Not a small dog.	Ọ bụghị obere nkịta.
I had it for a few months and it worked well.	Enwere m ya ọnwa ole na ole ma ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
He is a true friend.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ezigbo enyi.
Spiritually, it is very important who the parents are.	N'ihe gbasara mmụọ, ọ dị oke mkpa onye nne na nna bụ.
But everyone knows this.	Ma onye ọ bụla maara nke a.
Not too big.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu nnukwu.

And the stories he told me about your mother.	Na akụkọ ndị ọ gwara m gbasara nne gị.

The children are hungry!	Agụụ na-agụ ụmụaka!
Part of this is my fault.	N'akụkụ nke a bụ nke m kpatara.
This strategy has some advantages.	Atụmatụ a nwere uru ụfọdụ.
He came then.	Ọ bịara mgbe.
But her parents.	Ma nne na nna ya.
That is the point.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe.
So that’s what you have for dinner.	Ya mere, nke ahụ bụ ihe ị nwere maka nri abalị.
I told you, it was something.	Agwara m gị, ọ bụ ihe.
Land is useless.	Ala enweghị uru.

They are not good.	Ha adịghị mma.
I like my anger, it makes me feel strong.	Iwe m na-amasị m, ọ na-eme ka m nwee mmetụta dị ike.
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị.
It is the most efficient.	Ọ bụ nke kacha arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
The cold is very strong.	Oyi ahụ siri ezigbo ike.
Nothing happens without his knowledge.	Ọ dịghị ihe na-eme ma ọ maghị.
You should go to the doctor.	Ị ga-aga hụ dọkịta.

Some fish are old.	Ụfọdụ azụ̀ bụ nke ochie.
He should be angry.	O kwesịrị iwe ọkụ.

It is obviously a fever of some kind.	O doro anya na ọ bụ ahụ ọkụ nke ụdị ụfọdụ.
Very pretty girl.	Nwa agbọghọ mara mma nke ukwuu.

No, not much is going on.	Mba, ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ihe na-aga.

The feeling is not new and it is temporary.	Mmetụta ahụ abụghị ihe ọhụrụ na ọ bụ nwa oge.
I'm sure you will do well !.	Eji m n'aka na ị ga-eme nke ọma!.
I think it is very good.	Echere m na ọ dị mma nke ukwuu.

It looks great now.	Ọ dị ka nnukwu ugbu a.

I'm glad we got them.	Obi dị m ụtọ na anyị nwetara ha.
What works for some will not work for others.	Ihe na-arụ ọrụ maka ụfọdụ agaghị arụ ọrụ maka ndị ọzọ.
Just see a man in front of me right now.	Naanị hụ otu nwoke nọ n'ihu m ugbu a.
He speaks favorably, but he is not sure.	Ọ na-ekwu ihu ọma ma eleghị anya, ma ọ dịghị n'aka.
Do you want to help with dinner?	Ị chọrọ inye aka na nri abalị?
Somehow, I would like that.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, nke ahụ ga-amasị m.
Your gameplay is good.	Egwuregwu egwu gị dị mma.

He was the wisest man of his life.	Ọ bụ nwoke kacha mara ihe n'afọ ndụ ya.

He drank his coffee well.	Ọ na-aṅụ kọfị ya nke ọma.

The most important thing right now is to get them to eat again.	Ihe kacha mkpa ugbu a bụ ime ka ha rie nri ọzọ.

This is my brother.	Nke a bụ nwanne m nwoke.
It is not possible to walk around the city.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume iji ụkwụ gaa gburugburu obodo.
Or they could have done it as one.	Ma ọ bụ ha gaara eme ya dị ka otu.
I would have cried.	M gaara akwa ákwá.
What is cooking? 	Kedu ihe bụ isi nri?
he asked.	ọ jụrụ.
This room has four rooms.	Ụlọ a nwere ọnụ ụlọ anọ.
I am too young for a dog.	Adị m nwata nke ukwuu maka nkịta.
But that is not true.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
Things themselves.	Ihe n'onwe ya.
It is going well.	Ọ na-aga nke ọma.
They are not alone.	Ha abụghị naanị.
Feelings only occur occasionally.	Mmetụta na-eme naanị mgbe ụfọdụ.
Now, for what reason are you here?	Ugbu a, maka ihe kpatara ị ji nọrọ ebe a.
You don’t go fast.	Ị naghị aga ngwa ngwa.
This is the best that can be done right now.	Nke a bụ kacha nke enwere ike ime ugbu a.

But not within mine.	Mana ọ bụghị n'ime nke m.
I was there with her the day Mother left.	Mụ na ya nọ ebe ahụ ụbọchị nne m hapụrụ.
There are problems with this method, however.	Enwere nsogbu na ụzọ a, Otú ọ dị.
They do not know who is reading it.	Ha amaghị onye na-agụ ya.
I am not close.	Anọghị m nso.
Give your time.	Nye oge gị.
Obviously it is important.	O doro anya na ọ dị mkpa.
I do not want to say too much.	Achọghị m ikwu ọtụtụ ihe.
This may not be possible.	Nke a nwere ike ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
I have my own way.	Enwere m ụzọ nke m.
The study provided valuable information.	Ọmụmụ ihe ọmụmụ ahụ nyere ozi bara uru.
But that is not the case.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị ya.
This is something that works temporarily.	Nke a bụ ihe na-arụ ọrụ nwa oge.
It’s all about everything and two things.	Ọ bụ ihe niile na ihe ọ bụla na ihe abụọ.
The same group we attended last year.	Otu anyị gara ọtụtụ ụlọ akwụkwọ n'afọ gara aga.
That could be a better way.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ ụzọ ka mma.
I am young.	Adị m ka nwata.
I'll work on that.	Aga m arụ ọrụ na nke ahụ.
If you miss yourself.	Ọ bụrụ na ị na-atụ uche gị uche.
He has great speed and great hands.	O nwere nnukwu ọsọ na nnukwu aka.
We are close now.	Anyị nọ nso ugbu a.
They have no girlfriend.	Ha enweghị enyi nwanyị.
That's the kind of man he is.	Nke ahụ bụ ụdị nwoke ọ bụ.
Along with many other bad things.	Tinyere ọtụtụ ihe ọjọọ ndị ọzọ.
I do not know how.	Amaghị m ka m ga-esi.
But these are really nothing.	Mana ndị a enweghị ihe ọ bụla n'ezie.
Physical effects for no apparent reason.	Mmetụta anụ ahụ na-enweghị ihe kpatara ya.
Whatever you have, you have.	Ihe ọ bụla ị nwere, ị nwere.
Everything is very different there.	Ihe niile dị nnọọ iche n'ebe ahụ.
I do not want this.	Achọghị m nke a.
Men like fire.	Ọkụ na-amasị ụmụ nwoke.
He is intelligent.	Ọ bụ onye nwere uche.
But of course, the difference is real.	Ma n'ezie, ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu.
Now that’s awesome.	Ugbu a nke ahụ dị egwu.
I lied to him.	Agwara m ya ụgha.
All at the same time.	Ha niile n'otu oge.
The only food is mental.	Naanị nri bụ nke iche echiche.
I know it's you.	Ama m na ọ bụ gị.
He did not want to leave.	Ọ chọghị ịpụ.
Happily, I will be there soon.	Nwee obi ụtọ, m ga-anọ ebe ahụ n'oge adịghị anya.
All the others are just a joke for my happiness.	Ndị ọzọ niile bụ naanị ihe ọchị maka obi ụtọ m.
You can use whatever you like.	Ị nwere ike iji ihe ọ bụla masịrị gị.
We do.	Anyị na-eme.
So nothing.	Ya mere ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla.
The game itself is very beautiful.	Egwuregwu ahụ n'onwe ya mara mma nke ukwuu.
He pointed at me.	Ọ tụrụ m aka.
Now for the third time.	Ugbu a maka nke atọ.
Eating three meals a day is enough.	Iri nri atọ kwa ụbọchị zuru oke.
I think that is why he gave it.	Echere m na ọ bụ ya mere o ji nye ya.
But he left you.	Mana ọ hapụrụ gị.
We met at a supermarket.	Anyị zutere na nnukwu ụlọ ahịa.
I wonder what those thoughts are.	M na-eche ihe ndị ahụ na-eche.
Meeting people.	Nzukọ ndị mmadụ.
You can see anything there.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla n'ebe ahụ.
He is reasonable.	O nwere ezi uche.
In all directions.	N'akụkụ niile.
We can go anywhere.	Anyị nwere ike ịga ebe ọ bụla.
It seems to work for us.	Ọ dị ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka anyị.
Otherwise, you will have this all night.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ị ga-enwe nke a abalị niile.
There are many things that happen that way.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe na-eme otu ahụ.
I think it's a lie.	Echere m na ọ bụ ụgha.
But this still causes us problems.	Ma nke a ka na-eme ka anyị nwee nsogbu.
But he did not know what they were talking about.	Ma ọ maghị ihe ha na-ekwu.
He never did anything big on it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe o mere nnukwu ihe na ya.
Any good way to think.	Ọ bụla ezigbo ụzọ iche echiche.
Still, it is very bad.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ dị njọ nke ukwuu.
I do not think they.	Echeghị m ha.
It seems.	Ọ dị ka.
It's tough.	O siri ike.
Thanks tomorrow.	Daalụ echi.
Suppose it does.	Ka e were ya na o mere.
None of that now.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ndị ahụ ugbu a.
It tastes really good and variety.	Ọ nwere ezigbo ụtọ na ihe dị iche iche.
The rain stopped last night.	Mmiri ahụ kwụsịrị n'ime abalị ụnyahụ.
I said that.	M kwuru nke ahụ.
There is something better in you than anything else.	Enwere ezi ihe n'ime gị karịa ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
But the front is.	Ma n'ihu bụ.
I love this color.	Ahụrụ m agba a n'anya.
You can give it quickly.	Ị nwere ike inye ya ngwa ngwa.
They all did the last one.	Ha niile mere nke ikpeazụ.
This is the price of food.	Nke a bụ ọnụ ahịa nri.
Sleep here for a long time you like.	Ụra ebe a ogologo oge masịrị gị.
You think you know what you want.	Ị chere na ị maara ihe ị chọrọ.
Just using people.	Naanị iji ndị mmadụ.
What more could you ask for?	Kedu ihe ọzọ ị ga-achọ?.
They are happy.	Ha na-enwe obi ụtọ.
People think you need it.	Ndị mmadụ chere na ị chọrọ ya.
I know what it is, but that does not matter.	Amaara m ihe ọ bụ, mana nke ahụ adịghị mkpa.
This is a day without question.	Nke a bụ ụbọchị enweghị ajụjụ.
As it was yesterday.	Dị ka ọ dị ụnyahụ.
That was my first home.	Nke ahụ bụ ụlọ mbụ m.
Time seems to be running out.	O yiri ka oge ọ̀ kwụsịrị.
I do not do it.	Anaghị m eme ya.
Something different if you want it.	Ihe dị iche ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ ya.
I have a big threat here.	Enwere m nnukwu ihe egwu ebe a.
He went to another school.	Ọ gara ụlọ akwụkwọ ọzọ.
Therefore, he wants his words to be true.	Ya mere, ọ chọrọ ka okwu ya bụrụ eziokwu.
I am healthy.	Ahụ adị m mma.
Such moments can happen again.	Oge ndị dị otú a nwere ike ime ọzọ.
I was surprised.	O juru m anya.
The problem is on the customer side.	Nsogbu dị n'akụkụ ndị ahịa.
You feel for this couple.	Ị na-enwe mmetụta maka di na nwunye a.
I do not know anything.	Amaghị m ihe ọ bụla.
He didn't want to think about the door.	Ọ chọghị iche echiche banyere ọnụ ụzọ ahụ.
They are all very good members.	Ha niile bụ ezigbo ezigbo ndị otu.
I'll have breakfast now.	Aga m rie nri ụtụtụ ugbu a.
Take it easy now.	Were ya dị mfe ugbu a.
The best.	Nke kacha mma.
Then he saw again.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ hụrụ ọzọ.
Have fun all day.	Nwee obi ụtọ ụbọchị niile.
Nothing.	Ihe enweghị nke ọ bụla.
At home.	N'ụlọ.
Let's do it.	Ka anyị mee ya.
tough for everyone, probably.	siri ike maka onye ọ bụla, eleghị anya.
That would not be good.	Nke ahụ agaghị adị mma.
No one loves me.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ m n'anya.
I want to say two or three things.	Achọrọ m ikwu ihe abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ.
None of those situations exist here.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ọnọdụ ndị ahụ dị ebe a.
I love it.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya.
I do not know how.	Amaghị m ka m ga-esi.
Of course, he does.	N'ezie, ọ na-eme ya.
He will not let me.	Ọ gaghị ekwe ka m.
It is still a game you played when you were little.	Ọ ka bụ egwuregwu ị na-egwu mgbe ị dị obere.
I am cruel and angry.	Enwere m obi ọjọọ na iwe.
It is unknown.	Ọ bụ amaghị.
There is no way that the wine can go away.	O nweghị otú mmanya ahụ pụrụ isi pụọ n'anya.
The truth is that it is for everyone.	Eziokwu bụ na ọ bụ maka onye ọ bụla.
He can run.	O nwere ike ịgba ọsọ.
And have a mouth on it.	Ma nwee ọnụ na ya.
He left the city.	Ọ hapụrụ obodo ahụ.
The first does not exist.	Nke mbụ adịghị.
The difference, however, is real.	Otú ọ dị, ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu.
There is a difference.	E nwere ihe dị iche.
By the way, you have enough time.	Site n'ụzọ, ị nwere oge zuru oke.
How can these two countries move forward with each other.	Kedu ka mba abụọ a nwere ike isi gaa n'ihu n'otu ibe.
I feel like an unhappy place.	Ọ dị m ka ebe enweghị obi ụtọ.
The family lives in a comfortable house.	Ezinụlọ ahụ bi n'ụlọ dị mma.
There are two easy ways to capital.	Enwere ụzọ abụọ dị mfe isi obodo.
That will not be easy.	Nke ahụ agaghị adị mfe.
But she seemed to like it.	Ma o yiri ka ọ masịrị ya.
I know that tomorrow will continue.	Amaara m na echi ga-aga n'ihu.
This is a new feeling for me.	Nke a bụ mmetụta ọhụrụ nye m.
I want to know why this behavior is happening.	Achọrọ m ịma ihe kpatara na omume a na-eme.
But it is impossible.	Mana ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
Like many other things in the newspaper.	Dị ka ọtụtụ ihe ndị ọzọ na akwụkwọ akụkọ.
Of course, that you come from.	N'ezie, nke i si.
But that's not about you now.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị ihe gbasara gị ugbu a.
You must do what you say.	Ị ga-eme ihe i kwuru.
It may be a long night.	O nwere ike ịbụ abalị dị ogologo.
There is no way that this can happen.	O nweghị ụzọ nke a ga-esi mee.
He saw things.	Ọ hụrụ ihe.
Of course they turned out to be.	Nke n'ezie ha mechara bụrụ.
So, for some reason he did not want to see me.	Ya, n'ihi ihe ụfọdụ, ọ chọghị ịhụ m.
They can be negative.	Ha nwere ike ịbụ ndị na-adịghị mma.
Now things are very different.	Ugbu a, ihe dị nnọọ iche.
I just will not.	M nnọọ agaghị.
He wants more.	Ọ chọrọ ọzọ.
We will go.	Anyị ga-aga.
But you know what people look like.	Ma ị maara otú ndị mmadụ dị.
One country is.	Otu mba bụ.
Legal practice is not a right.	Omume iwu abụghị ikike.
Now she wonders why.	Ugbu a, ọ na-eche ihe kpatara ya.
So people read, they read.	Ya mere ndị mmadụ na-agụ akwụkwọ, ha na-agụ akwụkwọ.
We left them with his head.	Anyị hapụrụ ha isi ya.
But he wanted to do it.	Ma ọ chọrọ ime.
We got it.	Anyị nwetara ya.
It's very bad.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ihe ọjọọ.
Now these things are true.	Ugbu a ihe ndị a bụ eziokwu.
Let's go.	Ka anyị pụọ.
We are facing a tragedy.	Anyị na-eche otu ihe egwu ihu.
The backbone is here in the first place.	Isi azụ dị ebe a na nke mbụ.
Humans are far above the law.	Ụmụ mmadụ karịrị iwu.
You have to make your way.	Ị ga-eme ụzọ gị.
Money is important.	Ego dị mkpa.
This goes two ways, of course.	Nke a na-aga n'ụzọ abụọ, n'ezie.
Now, suppose we reject the idea of ​​going forward.	Ugbu a, were ya na anyị jụrụ echiche na-aga n'ihu.
He could not tell her that.	O nweghị ike ịgwa ya otú ahụ.
And you are.	Na ị bụ.
It's simple and beautiful music.	Ọ dị mfe na egwu mara mma.
No one says that.	Ọ dịghị onye na-ekwu otú ahụ.
They will not let you get it.	Ha agaghị ekwe ka ị nweta.
He drank heavily.	Ọ na-aṅụ ọtụtụ mmanya.
He gave them a book.	O nyere ha akwụkwọ.
Another thing is that they are very beautiful.	Ihe ọzọ bụ na ha mara ezigbo mma.
I love breakfast.	Ahụrụ m nri ụtụtụ n'anya.
For news, go here.	Maka akụkọ, gaa ebe a.
That's bad, why.	Nke ahụ dị njọ, gịnị mere.
One gift for the customer.	Otu onyinye maka onye ahịa.
Everyone wants her to be a girl.	Onye ọ bụla ga-achọ ya ka ọ bụrụ nwa nwanyị.
We are going this way.	Anyị na-aga n'ụzọ a.
Other types of cars may be available.	Ụdị ụgbọ ala ndị ọzọ nwere ike ịdị.
I do not think so.	Echeghị m nke ahụ.
So it is important to get it from food.	Ya mere ọ dị mkpa iji nweta ya site na nri.
Get the feeling as it works.	Nweta mmetụta ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
It started with it.	Ọ malitere na ya.
No sense now.	Enweghị isi ugbu a.

Everyone went away.	Onye ọ bụla wee pụọ.
He is a well-known actor,	Ọ bụ onye na-eme ihe nkiri ama ama,
I do not know what can happen.	Amaghị ihe nwere ike ime.
but really, it was a good day.	mana n'ezie, ọ bụ ezigbo ụbọchị.
They asked me the same question over and over again.	Ha jụrụ m otu ajụjụ ahụ ugboro ugboro.
Man and dog.	Nwoke na nkịta.
I do not want to say that.	Achọghị m ikwu otú ahụ.
Dogs are good friends.	Nkịta bụ ezigbo enyi mmadụ.
I'll go the other way.	Aga m aga n'ụzọ ọzọ.
He speaks two languages.	Ọ na-asụ asụsụ abụọ.
They like to have it in two ways.	Ọ na-amasị ha inwe ya ụzọ abụọ.
Go and see for yourself.	Gaa hụ onwe gị.
The man will be there to feed the dogs.	Nwoke ahụ ga-anọ ebe ahụ inye nkịta nri.
But he came.	Ma ọ bịara.
I can not imagine that he used our children to do what he liked.	Apụghị m iche na o ji ụmụ anyị mee ihe na-amasị ya.
Someone stole my purse.	Ọ nwere onye zuru obere akpa m.
Still, he felt that it was impossible.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, o chere na ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
That alone is not necessary.	Naanị nke ahụ adịghị mkpa.
I saw my father differently.	Ahụrụ m nna m n'ụzọ dị iche.
We need you.	Anyị chọrọ gị.
This is for the best for my son.	Nke a bụ maka ihe kacha mma maka nwa m nwoke.
The drink is good for you.	Ihe ọṅụṅụ dị mma maka gị.
He did not want to go.	Ọ chọghị ịga.
Every weekend is like this.	Ụbọchị izu ụka ọ bụla dị ka nke a.
No one knows.	Ọ dịghị onye maara.
But that does not have to happen.	Ma nke ahụ ekwesịghị ime.
But be very ready.	Ma dị nnọọ njikere.
It will never be seen again in the movie.	Agaghị ahụ ya ọzọ na ihe nkiri ahụ.
I was there.	Anọ m ebe ahụ.
That's what he thought.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe o chere.
Of course, he did not know me.	N'ezie, ọ maghị m.
We do not have to think about it.	Anyị ekwesịghị iche echiche banyere ya.
Then it was my turn.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ bụ oge m.
Do well in school today.	Mee nke ọma n'ụlọ akwụkwọ taa.
They know very well about him.	Ha mara nnọọ ihe banyere ya.
I thought about that for a long time.	M chere banyere nke ahụ ruo ogologo oge.
The president bought an old car.	Onye isi ala zụtara ụgbọ ala ochie.
Because water is available.	N'ihi na mmiri dị.
Until they do not do it again.	Ruo mgbe ha emeghị ọzọ.
That moment was perfect.	Oge ahụ zuru oke.
It is impossible to see from one room to another.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume ịhụ site n'otu ọnụ ụlọ gaa na nke ọzọ.
My mother was there because her family was there.	Nne m nọrọ n'ihi na ọ bụ ebe ahụ ka ezinụlọ ya nọ.
Because no.	N'ihi na ọ dịghị.
People do not go to church regularly.	Ndị mmadụ anaghị aga ụka a ugboro ugboro.
Which is nice in some ways.	Nke dị mma n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
Like a woman she is a woman.	Dị ka nwanyị ọ bụ nwanyị.
His whole family is like that.	Ndị ezinụlọ ya niile dị otú ahụ.
Everyone was amazed.	O juru onye ọ bụla anya.
I think they will be fine.	Echere m na ha ga-adị mma.
If not for me.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị maka m.
But not on this page.	Ma ọ bụghị na ibe a.
Or for yourself.	Ma ọ bụ maka onwe gị.
It can make things better.	O nwere ike ime ka ihe dị mma.
Soon people knew where he was.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, ndị mmadụ maara ebe ọ nọ.
I like to eat them as food.	Ọ na-amasị m iri ha dị ka nri n'onwe ya.
He will not weep.	Ọ gaghị akwa ákwá.
Suddenly, everything started to catch fire.	Na mberede, ihe niile malitere ịgba ọkụ.
They like our city anyway.	Ha na-amasị obodo anyị otú ọ dị.
And who knows, maybe it is.	Na onye maara, ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ.
He did not want any of that.	Ọ chọghị nke ọ bụla.

They are perfect for many things.	Ha zuru oke maka ọtụtụ ihe.
That was in the morning.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ụtụtụ.

They can be made of different materials.	Enwere ike iji ihe dị iche iche mee ha.
I think he was right.	Echere m na o kwuru eziokwu.
He stays there a long time.	Ọ nọrọ ebe ahụ ogologo oge.
He seems familiar, but different without them.	O yiri ka ọ maara nke ọma, ma dị iche na-enweghị ha.
Of course, many do.	N'ezie, ọtụtụ ndị na-eme ya.
He told me the truth.	Ọ gwara m eziokwu.
The President called us to move on.	Onye isi ala kpọrọ anyị ka anyị gaa n'ihu.
It's small.	Ọ dị obere.
Stop there.	Kwụsị ebe ahụ.
He knows their weaknesses.	Ọ ma ebe ha na-adịghị ike.
We do not want to, but we will do it.	Anyị achọghị, mana anyị ga-eme ya.

I'm not talking just because he's a good friend of mine.	Ihe m na-ekwu abụghị naanị n’ihi na ọ bụ ezigbo enyi m.
Thank you mother.	Daalụ nne.
There is nothing like me.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị ka m.
This is a very important book.	Nke a bụ akwụkwọ dị oke mkpa.
They told him that only themselves.	Ha gwara ya na naanị onwe ha.
They don't make me feel good.	Ha anaghị eme ka obi dị m mma.
But he was a wise boy.	Mana ọ bụ nwata mara ihe.
He thought this was a good thing.	O chere na nke a bụ ihe dị mma.
Photo of yourself as a child?	Foto nke gị mgbe ọ bụ nwata?
Now you say no.	Ugbu a ị sị mba.
Like a burning ball.	Dị ka bọọlụ ọkụ.
He wanted a land that had beautiful eyes.	Ọ chọrọ ala nke nwere anya mara mma.
This is our last trip together.	Nke a bụ njem ikpeazụ anyị ọnụ.
My thoughts on big brother.	Echiche m banyere nnukwu nwanne.
You are my best friend.	Ị bụ ezigbo enyi m.
We are both.	Anyị abụọ bụ ndị.
Personally, whatever the name is, it’s still cold.	Ya onwe ya, ihe ọ bụla aha ya bụ, oyi ka na-atụ.
The president speaks quickly.	Onye isi ala na-ekwu ngwa ngwa.
But we do not know why or what happened.	Ma anyị amaghị ihe kpatara ya ma ọ bụ ihe merenụ.
This will be done again.	A ga-eme nke a ọzọ.
The work was not done.	Emeghị ọrụ ahụ.
They are both very nice and friendly.	Ha abụọ mara nnọọ mma ma nwee omume enyi.
The difference is that he did it twice.	Ihe dị iche bụ na o mere ya ugboro abụọ.
But you can improve the situation.	Ma ị nwere ike ime ka ọnọdụ ahụ ka mma.
You know, whatever you want to do, it can be done here.	Ị mara, ihe ọ bụla ịchọrọ ime, enwere ike ime ya ebe a.
You just have no time.	Naanị ị nweghị oge.
No, it does not.	Mba, anaghị eme.
Winter is my sporting season.	Oge oyi bụ oge egwuregwu m.
Many locals came to the meeting.	Ọtụtụ ndị obodo bịara nzukọ a.
What they could have told each other.	Ihe ha gaara agwa ibe ha.
He said this was not the first attack.	O kwuru na nke a abụghị ọgụ mbụ.
I actually saw it.	Ahụrụ m ya n'ezie.
Stop feeling this way.	Kwụsị inwe mmetụta otu a.
It is worth it.	Ọ bara uru ya.
It doesn’t seem like they can’t, or like they haven’t in the past.	Ọ dịghị ka ha enweghị ike, ma ọ bụ dị ka ha enweghị n'oge gara aga.
He loved his job.	Ọ hụrụ ọrụ ya n'anya.
Everything is as it should be.	Ihe niile dị ka o kwesịrị ịdị.
Some are good.	Ụfọdụ dị mma.
Therefore, any new information is useful.	Ya mere, ozi ọhụrụ ọ bụla bara uru.
But this is not true.	Ma nke a abụghị eziokwu.
But he did not know that he was leaving.	Ma ọ maghị na ọ hapụrụ.
That is his name.	Nke ahụ bụ aha ya.
He is on trial now.	Ọ na-aga ikpe ikpe ugbu a.
But it really is.	Ma n'ezie ọ bụ.
They took the law into their own hands.	Ha were iwu ahụ n’aka ha.
People know him.	Ndị mmadụ ma ya.
Wait a little longer though.	Chere obere oge n'agbanyeghị.
But that’s your problem, not everyone else’s.	Ma nke ahụ bụ nsogbu gị, ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
As we will now.	Dị ka anyị ga-eme ugbu a.
She and her husband are parents with four large children.	Ya na di ya bụ nne na nna nwere nnukwu ụmụ anọ.
It may be true.	O nwere ike ịbụ eziokwu.
This is all the way or nothing.	Nke a bụ ụzọ niile ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
The news shocked the villagers.	Akụkọ ahụ juru ndị obodo ahụ anya.
They are really tough.	Ha siri ike n'ezie.
So that we will never do it again.	Nke mere na anyị agaghị eme ya ọzọ.
But she did not know why she was leaving.	Ma ọ maghị ihe mere o ji pụọ.
One boat in them.	Otu ụgbọ mmiri n'ime ha.
Thank you for my life back.	Daalụ maka ndụ m azụ.
But they are not gifts that everyone can use.	Ma ha abụghị onyinye onye ọ bụla nwere ike iji.
They were about his age.	Ha dị ihe dị ka afọ ndụ ya.
But it is one of the best.	Ma ọ bụ otu n'ime ihe kacha mma.
But that is what they all did.	Ma otú ahụ ka ha niile mere.
It was the word of the day.	Ọ bụ okwu nke oge ahụ.
Obviously there is a bad news story but that has nothing.	O doro anya na enwere akụkọ akụkọ na-adịghị mma mana nke ahụ nwere ihe ọ bụla.
So who knows.	Ya mere, onye maara.
There we had a nice city.	N'ebe ahụ, anyị nwere ezigbo obodo.
We are looking for them.	Anyị na-achọ ha.
Do whatever it takes to do this.	Mee ihe ọ bụla na-eme nke a.
They were given for everything.	E nyere ha maka ihe niile.
The four games are very important, obviously.	Egwuregwu anọ ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa, doro anya.
I am not the only one who can do that.	Ọ bụghị naanị m nwere ike ime nke ahụ.
I don’t want anyone to see this.	Achọghị m ka onye ọ bụla hụ nke a.
He cooked a delicious meal.	O siri nri dị ụtọ.
But it is possible.	Ma o kwere omume.
But as it began it stopped.	Ma dị ka ọ malitere ọ kwụsịrị.
So they will not.	Ya mere, ha agaghị.
Most likely he will not.	O yikarịrị ka ọ gaghị eme ya.
But this is good for him.	Ma nke a dị ya mma.
There is a problem of being known as a couple.	Enwere nsogbu ịbụ ndị a maara dị ka di na nwunye.
But living plants.	Ma osisi ndị dị ndụ.
You yourself.	Gị onwe gị nwoke.
So people expected more than that.	Ya mere ndị mmadụ tụrụ anya ihe karịrị ya.
Here is a music video.	Ebe a nwere otu egwu egwu.
Go to work, he said.	Gaa ọrụ, o kwuru.
I know you need that.	Ama m na nke ahụ dị gị mkpa.
Speaking of women.	Na-ekwu maka ụmụ nwanyị.
Take it from someone who knows.	Were ya n'aka onye maara.
My skin is better.	Akpụkpọ ahụ m ka mma.
A lot of girls have trouble seeing me as a person.	Ọtụtụ ụmụ agbọghọ na-enwe nsogbu ịhụ m ka mmadụ.
It's not very good.	Ọ dịghị mma nke ukwuu.
I think you are me.	Echere m na ị bụ m.
The happiest women.	Ụmụ nwanyị kacha nwee obi ụtọ.
He could not have both.	O nweghị ike inwe ha abụọ.
I sat in front of him.	M nọdụ ala n'ihu ya.
It's impossible.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
That’s a big deal.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ego.
It has a low cost.	O nwere ọnụ ala dị ala.
They are not, of course.	Ha abụghị, n'ezie.
They said it was just wood.	Ha kwuru na ọ bụ naanị osisi.
You can not say that about many plants.	Ị nweghị ike ikwu nke ahụ gbasara ọtụtụ osisi.
This is their way.	Nke a bụ ụzọ ha.
He seems to understand.	O yiri ka ọ ghọtara.
Then he saw it.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ hụrụ ya.
Do this over and over again.	Mee nke a ugboro ugboro.
To assist you further, there will be additional information required.	Iji nyere gị aka n'ihu, a ga-enwe ozi ndị ọzọ achọrọ.
It is in the countryside.	Ọ dị n'ime ime obodo.
This city has something for everyone.	Obodo a nwere ihe maka onye ọ bụla.
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
Glad you liked them.	Obi dị gị ụtọ na ị masịrị ha.
There is only a game.	Enwere naanị egwuregwu.
A book that delights readers.	Akwụkwọ na-atọ ụtọ ndị na-agụ akwụkwọ.
It's beautiful.	Ọ bụ ihe mara mma.
No, my angel.	Mba, mmụọ ozi m.
Then the gloves.	Mgbe ahụ, uwe aka.
I wonder if.	M na-eche ma.
The game is ours.	Egwuregwu bụ nke anyị na anyị mere.
My friend did not see it.	Enyi m ahụghị ya.
But just for you.	Mana naanị maka gị.
Same money with many women.	Otu ego na ọtụtụ ụmụ nwanyị.
It wants to be known for testing.	Ọ na-achọ ka a mara maka ule.
Life is so sweet.	Ndụ dị ụtọ nke ukwuu.
Everywhere, there are people.	Ebe ọ bụla, e nwere ndị mmadụ.
Many office workers travel daily.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọrụ ụlọ ọrụ na-eme njem kwa ụbọchị.
One possibility is that they are from the same place.	Otu ihe nwere ike ime bụ na ha si n'otu ebe.
Pretty Woman.	Nwanyị mara mma.
But for some parents, the opposite is true.	Ma nye ụfọdụ ndị nne na nna, ha chere eziokwu dị iche ihu.
It was a foolish time but a time of life.	Ọ bụ oge nzuzu mana oge ndụ.
Here you can see all the applications.	Ebe ị nwere ike ịhụ ngwa niile.
He spent much of his life alone.	Ọ nọrọ naanị ya ọtụtụ oge ná ndụ ya.
Now do something about it.	Ugbu a mee ihe banyere ya.
But they have many books.	Ma ha nwere ọtụtụ akwụkwọ.
I was in a meeting.	Anọ m na nzukọ.
Righteousness is at night.	Ezi omume bụ n'abalị.
I am a teacher.	Abụ m onye nkuzi.
His song and this is that.	Abụ ya na nke a bụ nke ahụ.
He has in the past.	O nwere n'oge gara aga.
Where anything can happen.	Ebe ihe ọ bụla nwere ike ime.
I really like it, of course.	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu, n'ezie.
He works there.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ ebe ahụ.
Two more are in the back.	Abụọ ọzọ nọ n'azụ.
I like shooting one or two colors.	Ọ masịrị m ịgba otu agba ma ọ bụ abụọ.
Great power.	Ike dị ukwuu.
Some say it is not good for children.	Ụfọdụ na-ekwu na ọ dịghị mma maka ụmụaka.
His power gave me strength.	Ike ya nyere m ike.
I want to be more than a wife and mother.	Achọrọ m ịbụ karịa nwunye na nne.
Absolute power is fun.	Ike zuru oke na-atọ ụtọ.
But they are children.	Mana ha bụ ụmụaka.
That would be it.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ya.
It started here.	Ọ malitere ebe a.
We have a lot of students.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ ụmụ akwụkwọ.
The human mind is free.	Uche mmadụ nwere onwe ya.
I thought about customers.	M chere banyere ndị ahịa.
You will not have it.	Ị gaghị enwe ya.
I don't like this at all.	Ihe a anaghị amasị m ma ọlị.
There is nothing that any of you can do.	Ọ dịghị ihe onye ọ bụla n'ime unu pụrụ ime.
And the time is.	Na oge bụ.
We do well.	Anyị na-eme nke ọma.
Height may be one of the reasons.	Elu nwere ike ịbụ otu n'ime ihe kpatara ya.
I could have done something really different.	M gaara eme ihe dị iche n'ezie.
It's tough.	O siri ike.
It will not be helpful.	Ọ gaghị abụ enyemaka.
He did two things.	O mere ihe abụọ.
Obviously what to do.	O doro anya ihe ị ga-eme.
However, two years ago we had the same problem.	Otú ọ dị, afọ abụọ gara aga, anyị nwere otu nsogbu ahụ.
Only the same person is.	Naanị otu onye ahụ bụ.
Can you see?	Ị nwere ike ịhụ?
I got out of the way.	M pụọ n'ụzọ.
A lot of people work but they have limits.	Ọtụtụ ndị na-arụ ọrụ mana ha nwere oke.
Maybe we should not.	Ma eleghị anya anyị ekwesịghị.
And so on.	Na ihe ọzọ.
As you can see that did not happen.	Dị ka ị pụrụ ịhụ nke ahụ emeghị.
Then there is music and everything.	Mgbe ahụ enwere egwu na ihe niile.
The game is individual.	Egwuregwu ahụ dị n'otu n'otu.
No good news, no bad news.	Enweghị ozi ọma, enweghị akụkọ ọjọọ.
He did not like her.	O nweghị mmasị n'ebe ọ nọ.
He said he was talking about himself, not a friend.	O kwuru na ọ na-ekwu maka onwe ya, ọ bụghị enyi.
Many things happen at once.	Ọtụtụ ihe na-eme otu mgbe.
Then we will move on.	Mgbe ahụ anyị ga-aga n'ihu.
He should not go out again.	O kwesịghị ịpụ ọzọ.
There is no room for doubt.	Enweghị ohere maka obi abụọ.
The man had a heart attack, he could go anytime.	Nwoke ahụ nwere ọrịa obi, ọ nwere ike ịga oge ọ bụla.
But then nothing more was said.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ e kwuru.
Now is the time to act.	Ugbu a bụ oge ime ihe.
It is difficult though.	Ọ bụ ihe siri ike n'agbanyeghị.
Then the book.	Mgbe ahụ akwụkwọ.
You are very close.	Ị dị ezigbo nso.
In simple pictures.	Na foto ndị dị mfe.
I tried to be a good friend.	M gbalịrị ịbụ ezigbo enyi.
Many people get sick.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ dara ọrịa.
The facts speak for themselves.	Ihe ndị bụ́ eziokwu kwuru n’onwe ha.
No one left the car.	Ọ dịghị onye hapụrụ ụgbọ ala ahụ.
That year, they focused on different things.	N'afọ ahụ, ha na-eche banyere ihe dị iche iche.
I will use them again.	Aga m eji ha ọzọ.
It is good here.	Ọ dị mma na ebe a.
I don't think he liked it very much.	Echeghị m na ọ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
We think of them all the time, wherever we are.	Anyị na-eche banyere ha mgbe niile, n'ebe ọ bụla anyị nọ.
I do not see how we can do it.	Ahụghị m ka anyị ga-esi mee ya.
Not a year or two.	Ọ bụghị otu afọ ma ọ bụ abụọ.
The car is just an app.	Ụgbọ ala bụ naanị ngwa.
He left the fire.	Ọ hapụrụ ọkụ.
The application is only for the skin.	Ngwa bụ naanị akpụkpọ ahụ.
He seems to love it.	O yiri ka ọ hụrụ ya n'anya.
He is happy to see that.	Obi dị ya ụtọ ịhụ nke ahụ.
We are not good or bad.	Anyị adịghị mma ma ọ bụ njọ.
She misses another head.	Ọ na-atụ uche isi isi ọzọ.
He looked again.	Ọ lere anya ọzọ.
We can all see that this is not good.	Anyị niile nwere ike ịhụ na nke a adịghị mma.
But there is.	Ma e nwere.
This message was successful.	Ozi a gara nke ọma.
He spoke well.	O kwuru nke ọma.
It's really good.	Ọ dị mma n'ezie.
Be stupid if you want to.	Bụrụ onye nzuzu ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ.
Where he would like to go.	Ebe ọ ga-achọ ịga.
Now they are ready for each other but the final color.	Ugbu a, ha dị njikere maka ibe ha mana agba ikpeazụ.
To her it was a women’s job.	Nye ya ọ bụ ọrụ ụmụ nwanyị.
He wants them both.	Ọ chọrọ ha abụọ.
I run to get out.	M na-agba ọsọ ka m pụọ.
As long as he was there, people thought he was fine.	Ogologo oge ọ nọ n'ebe ahụ, mmadụ chere na ọ dị mma ka ọ dị.
No one was there.	O nweghị onye nọ ebe ahụ.
No one loves her.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya n'anya.
One cannot live without the other.	Otu enweghị ike ịdị ndụ ma ọ bụrụ na nke ọzọ adịghị.
They are not alone.	Ha anọghị naanị m.
Fish things happen around here.	Ihe azụ na-eme gburugburu ebe a.
He does not know everything.	Ọ maghị ihe niile.
It may not be so.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị adị otú ahụ.
I hope this is useful.	Enwere m olileanya na nke a bara uru.
It is very good there.	Ọ dị mma nke ukwuu ebe ahụ.
I have two children and a husband.	Mụ na ụmụ abụọ na di.
I know that makes sense to me.	Ama m na nke ahụ nwere ezi uche nye m.
There will be another.	A ga-enwe ọzọ.
We may not.	Anyị nwere ike ọ gaghị.
However, what I mean is that he is an angel.	Otú ọ dị, ihe m na-ekwu bụ na ọ bụ mmụọ ozi.
One of the most important things is time.	Otu n'ime ihe kacha mkpa bụ oge.
No, one did not.	Mba, otu onye emeghị.
You did well.	I mere nke ọma.
Three journalists were in court.	Ndị nta akụkọ atọ nọ n'ụlọ ikpe ahụ.
Those things aren't very good.	Ihe ndị ahụ adịghị mma nke ukwuu.
Very reasonable.	Dị nnọọ ezi uche.
Two months now.	Ọnwa abụọ ugbu a.
There is nothing you can do now.	O nweghị ihe ị ga-eme ugbu a.
The idea of ​​hope.	Echiche nke olileanya.
They are like you and me.	Ha dị ka mụ na gị.
He was my best friend, and we became good friends.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi m, anyị wee bụrụ ezigbo enyi.
We are a boy and a girl with nothing.	Anyị bụ nwoke na nwa agbọghọ na-enweghị ihe ọ bụla.
The applications are new and fast.	Ngwa ndị ahụ dị ọhụrụ ma dị ngwa ngwa.
You expect so much from me.	Ị na-atụ anya nke ukwuu n'aka m.
This is the only reasonable amount to use.	Nke a bụ naanị ego ezi uche dị na ya iji.
If it lasts too long.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ nọrọ ogologo oge.
But that is not really a big deal.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị n'ezie nnukwu ihe.
It is impossible to say this.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume ikwu nke a.
He went on his own.	Ọ gara n'onwe ya.
That makes it so.	Nke ahụ na-eme ya.
He called the doctor.	Ọ kpọrọ dọkịta ahụ.
First, the speed of the man.	Mbụ, ọsọ nke nwoke.
But, of course, it is not good.	Ma, n'ezie, ọ dịghị mma.
It will never be that way!	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-adị otú ahụ!
A car is needed for a quick trip.	A na-achọ ụgbọ ala maka njem ngwa ngwa.
Those were tough days.	Ụbọchị ndị ahụ siri ike.
My team is not doing well.	Ndị otu m anaghị eme nke ọma.
It is very useful.	Ọ bara nnọọ uru.
It is difficult to reconcile these ideas.	O siri ike ime ka echiche ndị a dị n'otu.
There will be time for that, he knows.	A ga-enwe oge maka nke ahụ, ọ maara.
There are no jobs going on, of course.	Enweghị ọrụ ọ bụla ka ọ na-aga, n'ezie.
It's very simple.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe.
He made it easy.	O mere ka ọ dị mfe.
It's not a lie, of course.	Ọ bụghị ụgha, n'ezie.
You know, if you’re feeling.	Ị mara, ọ bụrụ na ị na-enwe mmetụta.
You should know such a thing.	Ị kwesịrị ịma ihe dị otú ahụ.
He has many friends.	O nwere ọtụtụ ndị enyi.
Take the image of your mind in front of you.	Were anya nke uche gị n'ihu gị.
I want to rest.	Achọrọ izu ike.
I want it to belong to him.	Achọrọ m ka ọ bụrụ nke ya.
If your child has a mental illness or anything is wrong.	Ọ bụrụ na nwa gị nwere nsogbu uche ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla adịghị mma.
Tonight is night.	Abalị taa bụ abalị.
One by one, looking for anything that is not.	Otu otu, na-achọ ihe ọ bụla na-adịghị.
It is very clear.	O doro anya nke ọma.
Wait, that's only two.	Chere, nke ahụ bụ naanị abụọ.
The head is well aware but unique.	Isi ahụ maara nke ọma ma ọ pụrụ iche.
He liked the price.	Ọnụ ahịa ahụ masịrị ya.
They don't like anything else.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ anaghị amasị ha.
I do not know how they do it.	Amaghị m ka ha si eme ya.
But you have others.	Ma i nwere ndị ọzọ.
There is a new fast food restaurant in the city.	Enwere ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ ngwa ngwa ọhụrụ na obodo.
You understand the key.	Ị ghọtara isi ihe.
Mr. President, we wish you success.	Onye isi ala, anyị na-achọ gị ịga nke ọma.
They got it.	Ha nwetara ya.
He had a high opinion of himself.	O nwere echiche dị elu banyere onwe ya.
His story is good.	Akụkọ ya dị mma.
But then we can not.	Ma mgbe ahụ anyị nwere ike ghara.
He went to court.	Ọ gara n’ụlọ ikpe.
There were only three other people in the hall.	Enwere naanị mmadụ atọ ọzọ n'ime nnukwu ọnụ ụlọ ahụ.
I did not, no.	Emeghị m, mba.
I told him not to call me again.	M gwara ya ka ọ ghara ịkpọ m ọzọ.
She may be in a room where people are drinking.	O nwere ike ịnọ n'ọnụ ụlọ ebe ndị mmadụ na-aṅụ mmanya.
The boss knows he can't stay in a big house.	Onye isi ahụ maara na ya enweghị ike ịnọ na nnukwu ụlọ.
We stopped for a few minutes.	Anyị kwụsịrị nkeji ole na ole.
Now he is angry.	Ugbu a iwe were ya.
One or the other.	Otu ma ọ bụ nke ọzọ.
Different methods can be used.	Enwere ike iji ụzọ dị iche iche.
You will be easy.	Ị ga-adị mfe.
Somehow, something very different happened.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ihe dị nnọọ iche mere.
Great fast job for summer.	Nnukwu ọrụ ngwa ngwa maka oge okpomọkụ.
He is a musician.	Ọ bụ onye egwu.
But he knew very well.	Ma ọ maara nke ukwuu.
He does not tell us anything.	Ọ naghị agwa anyị ihe ọ bụla.
This is the case for a number of reasons.	Nke a bụ ikpe maka ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
We were in temporary trouble there.	Anyị nọ ná nsogbu nwa oge n'ebe ahụ.
It will be a big fight.	Ọ ga-abụ nnukwu ọgụ.
Take your food.	Were nri gị.
It looks like it.	Ọ dị ka ya.
If you would like to help, please let us know.	Ọ bụrụ na ị ga-achọ inye aka, biko mee ka anyị mara.
What he was saying was stupid to me.	Ihe ọ na-ekwu bụ ihe nzuzu nye m.
It will not be the last.	Ọ gaghị abụ nke ikpeazụ n'ezie.
But only one wife.	Mana naanị otu nwunye.
It happens, it’s there.	Ọ na-eme, ọ dị ebe ahụ.
These things are not true.	Ihe ndị a abụghị eziokwu.
That’s as simple as that.	Nke ahụ dị mfe dị ka nke ahụ.
They are all useful.	Ha niile bara uru.
The city sky is beautiful.	Igwe elu igwe obodo mara mma.
But that will not happen.	Ma nke ahụ agaghị eme.
That is a spiritual condition.	Nke ahụ bụ ọnọdụ ime mmụọ.
For example.	Dị ka ihe atụ.
The worst is yet to come.	Nke kacha njọ ka ga-abịa.
He gave this as an example.	O nyere nke a dị ka ihe atụ.
So, he is happy.	N’ihi ya, obi dị ya ụtọ.
The man looked very much like her.	Nwoke ahụ yiri ya nke ukwuu.
I can't help it.	Enweghị m ike inyere ya aka.
Or worse, that he was there all the time.	Ma ọ bụ nke ka njọ, na ọ nọ n'ebe ahụ oge niile.
He runs in the morning.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ n'ụtụtụ.
It can be anything.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọ bụla.
Hope it will help you.	Echere na ọ ga-enyere gị aka.
I'd like to go there.	Ọ ga-amasị m ka anyị gaa ebe ahụ.
I told the phone company.	Agwara m ụlọ ọrụ ekwentị.
That did two things.	Nke ahụ mere ihe abụọ.
Only this time it was tough.	Naanị oge a ka ọ siri ike.
That will be soon.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ n'oge adịghị anya.
You know how to do it now.	Ị maara ka esi eme ya ugbu a.
It would be awesome.	Ọ ga-adị egwu.
Not us.	Ọ bụghị anyị.
But that is what happened in this case.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe mere na nke a.
There is no problem there.	Enweghị nsogbu ebe ahụ.
I love family travel.	Enwere m mmasị na njem ezinụlọ.
I have nothing to fear.	Ọ dịghị ihe na-atụ m ụjọ.

He was expected to do so.	A tụrụ anya na ọ ga-eme otú ahụ.
They are fast.	Ha na-eme ọsọ ọsọ.
A house is a house.	Ụlọ bụ ụlọ.

That is why they do what they do.	Ọ bụ ya mere ha ji eme ihe ha na-eme.
I think it probably is not working properly.	Echere m na ọ ga-abụ na ọ naghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
No one saw anything.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ihe ọ bụla.

But the main problem, of course, is that she is a woman.	Ma isi nsogbu, n'ezie, bụ na ọ bụ nwanyị.

It was one of the reasons he loved her so much.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ihe mere ọ ga-eji hụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
Are you sure you want to do that?	Ị ji n'aka na ị ga-achọ ime nke ahụ?

There are no questions about that.	Enweghị ajụjụ gbasara nke ahụ.

So seeing him there, he was amazed.	Ya mere, ịhụ ya n'ebe ahụ, ọ tụrụ onwe ya n'anya.

We went for a drink, in the afternoon.	Anyị gara na-aṅụ mmanya, n'oge ehihie.

Again, we come to bad news.	Ọzọ, anyị na-abịa na akụkọ ọjọọ.

Of course, no one saw it.	N'ezie, ọ dịghị onye ọ hụrụ.

Your name is on the door.	Aha gị dị n'ọnụ ụzọ.
Just for the sake of convenience, you may or may not want that.	Naanị maka ịdị mma, ị nwere ike ma ọ bụ ị gaghị achọ nke ahụ.
For a small reason, no less.	Na obere ihe kpatara ya, ọ dịghị obere.
He did not know how he did this.	Ọ maghị otú o si mee nke a.
Suppose there is one.	Ka anyị were na e nwere otu.

They were surrounded.	A nọ na-agba ha gburugburu.
That is, by the way, good news.	Ya bụ, n'ụzọ, ezigbo ozi ọma.
He confronted the customer positively.	O chere onye ahịa ahụ ihu nke ọma.

He is now in the office.	Ọ nọ n'ụlọ ọrụ ugbu a.

The length of time he stays in the cold still makes sense.	Ogologo oge ọ nọrọ na oyi ka na-eme onwe ya.
There are no absolute questions.	Enweghị ajụjụ zuru oke.

But they are there.	Ma ha nọ ebe ahụ.
But there are no rules.	Ma enweghị iwu iwu.
Then he fell asleep again.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ dara ụra ọzọ.
Which is worse, because the fire has to be going on.	Nke dị njọ, n'ihi na ọkụ kwesịrị ịdị na-aga.
This is not the first terrible idea.	Nke a abụghị echiche mbụ dị egwu.

Whatever he expected, he did not.	Ihe ọ bụla ọ tụrụ anya ya, ọ bụghị ya.
That is awesome.	Nke ahụ dị oke egwu.
He saw the flames.	Ọ hụrụ ọkụ ụta.

This road goes along the waterfront.	Ụzọ a na-aga n'akụkụ mmiri mmiri.
None of us expected you to do anything more than that.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị tụrụ anya ka ị mee ihe ọ bụla ọzọ karịa nke ahụ.
All his colleagues were pleased with their success.	Ndị ọrụ ibe ya niile nwere obi ụtọ na atụmatụ ha gara nke ọma.

Everything else is still playing.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ ka na-egwu egwu.

He does not seem to have any girlfriend.	O yighị ka o nwere enyi nwanyị ọ bụla.

Whatever you want, let me know.	Ihe ọ bụla ịchọrọ, mee ka m mara.
But sometimes, they go further.	Ma mgbe ụfọdụ, ha na-aga n'ihu.
The offender was convicted and sentenced.	A mara onye ahụ dara iwu ikpe ma mara ya ikpe.
By all accounts, it was a great success.	Site na akụkọ niile, ọ bụ nnukwu ihe ịga nke ọma.

Perhaps this type of thing would appeal to some.	Ma eleghị anya, ụdị ihe a ga-amasị ụfọdụ.
He invited me to his home.	Ọ kpọrọ m ka m bịa n’ụlọ ya.
We are looking for people who know.	Anyị na-achọ ndị maara.

Our city is known for its pleasant climate.	A maara obodo anyị maka ihu igwe dị ụtọ.

Why are you here?	Gịnị mere i ji nọrọ ebe a?

However, every lot funny.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụla ọtụtụ ihe ọchị.
He left the city.	Ọ hapụrụ obodo ahụ.

I want to tell him that, for me.	Achọrọ m ịgwa ya nke ahụ, maka m.
Or it is not.	Ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị.

No more words, now is the time to act.	Enweghị okwu ọzọ, ugbu a bụ oge ime ihe.
Fish swimming.	Azụ na-egwu mmiri.

What more can be said.	Kedu ihe ọzọ enwere ike ikwu.

But every child has different needs.	Ma nwa ọ bụla nwere mkpa dị iche iche.

A year ago, it would not be like that.	Otu afọ gara aga, ọ gaghị adị otú ahụ.
They do not know what is right and what is wrong.	Ha amaghị ihe dị mma na ihe na-adịghị mma.

But where there is fear, there is hope.	Ma ebe egwu dị, enwere olileanya.
I'm sure we're in the room.	Eji m n'aka na anyị nọ n'ime ụlọ.
Great passion for simplicity.	Nnukwu mmasị maka ịdị mfe.
Doing what they wanted did not go anywhere.	Ime ihe ha chọrọ emeghị ya ebe ọ bụla.
The good news is that it is good.	Ozi ọma ahụ bụ na ọ dị mma.
I did not understand why I was hired.	Aghọtaghị m ihe mere eji were m n'ọrụ.

However, there is another threat.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere egwu ọzọ.

He would have liked to do this once.	Ọ gaara achọ ime nke a otu ugboro.
Lots of people.	Ọtụtụ mmadụ.

However, that is another story, in another book.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ọzọ, na akwụkwọ ọzọ.
He did not say how he did it.	O nweghị ihe o kwuru otú o si mee.

However, the school is new.	Otú ọ dị, ụlọ akwụkwọ ahụ dị ọhụrụ.

Not at all.	Ọ bụghị nke ahụ ma ọlị.
Nothing but that.	Ọ dịghị ihe ma nke ahụ.

Which way is it?	Kedu ụzọ ọ dị?
People were there at the time.	Ndị mmadụ nọ n'oge ahụ.

Everyone has their own hands.	Onye ọ bụla nwere aka ya.

The second letter works.	Akwụkwọ ozi nke abụọ na-arụ ọrụ.
The price is very good.	Ọnụ ahịa dị ezigbo mma.
That is his job.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ ya.
Then he came again.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ bịara ọzọ.
Her father was studying.	Nna ya nọ na-agụ akwụkwọ.
Journalists asked many questions.	Ndị nta akụkọ jụrụ ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
The other two are my own employees.	Abụọ ndị ọzọ bụ ndị ọrụ nke m.
And for good reason.	Na ezi ihe kpatara ya.

Obviously, this does not make sense.	N'ụzọ doro anya, nke a abụghị ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
One time they were not there, the next they were.	Otu oge ha anọghị ebe ahụ, nke ọzọ ha nọ.
The doctor asked the man about his wife's condition.	Dọkịta ahụ jụrụ nwoke ahụ banyere ọrịa nwunye ya.
It's not a fight.	Ọ bụghị ọgụ ya.
Emotional studies have no effect.	Ọmụmụ ihe ọmụmụ mmetụta mmetụta enweghị mmetụta ọ bụla.
Our handiwork was waiting for us to arrive.	Ọrụ aka anyị nọ na-eche ka anyị rutere.
He said well that only kind of looked at me.	O kwuru nke ọma na naanị ụdị lere m anya.

That was evident from the clothes he was wearing.	Nke ahụ doro anya site na uwe o yi.
But then things happened.	Ma ihe mechara mee.
You know it.	Ị maara ya.
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị ya.
Many different people think differently about it.	Ọtụtụ ndị dị iche iche na-eche ọtụtụ ụzọ dị iche iche banyere ya.
That way.	N'ụzọ dị otú ahụ.
Or, do something physical during your vacation.	Ma ọ bụ, mee ihe anụ ahụ n'oge ezumike gị.

Some important people will be there.	Ụfọdụ ndị dị mkpa ga-anọ ebe ahụ.

This hungry boy is waiting for food.	Nwata a na-agụ agụụ na-eche nri.
I was as surprised as anyone else.	O juru m anya dị ka onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
You still think about it, don't you?	Ị ka na-eche banyere ya, ọ́ bụghị ya?
His father died when he was very young.	Nna ya nwụrụ mgbe ọ dị obere.
A few words man.	Nwoke okwu ole ma ole.

Please stay tuned.	Biko nọrọ na ibe a.
There is no difference there.	Enweghị ihe dị iche n'ebe ahụ.

He comes for us.	Ọ na-abịa maka anyị.
Going forward is a perfect example of all that.	Ịga n'ihu bụ ihe atụ zuru oke maka ihe ahụ niile.
His eyes widened.	Anya ya juru.
This is a game, he told himself.	Nke a bụ egwuregwu, ọ gwara onwe ya.
We do it using two types.	Anyị na-eme ya site na iji ụdị abụọ.
We can't see most of us.	Anyị enweghị ike ịhụ ọtụtụ ndị anyị.

It is the last day of the year.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị ikpeazụ nke afọ.
And your other money too.	Na ego gị ndị ọzọ kwa.
Everything is very different there now.	Ihe niile dị nnọọ iche ebe ahụ ugbu a.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla na-adịghị njọ na nke ahụ.

Four boys without girls.	Ụmụ nwoke anọ na-enweghị ụmụ nwanyị.
That is four words.	Nke ahụ bụ okwu anọ.
He will never go there again.	Ọ gaghị aga ebe ahụ ọzọ.
They are for me, they may not be for you.	Ha bụ maka m, ha nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ maka gị.
We both know why.	Anyị abụọ ma ihe kpatara ya.

This is a little of the same thing.	Nke a bụ ntakịrị ihe otu ihe ahụ.
He does not eat.	Ọ naghị eri nri.
An angel is an angel is an angel.	Mmụọ ozi bụ mmụọ ozi bụ mmụọ ozi.
It may be night.	O nwere ike ịbụ abalị.
I want to talk about it.	Achọrọ m ikwu maka ya.
He wants us to know him.	Ọ chọrọ ka anyị mara ya.
Many people understand this.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ghọtara nke a.
But it certainly is not.	Ma o doro anya na ọ bụghị ya.
You are a fool.	Ị bụ onye nzuzu.
My brother and his wife are there now.	Nwanne m nwoke na nwunye ya nọ ebe ahụ ugbu a.
It is his life situation.	Ọ bụ ọnọdụ ndụ ya.
It was definitely nice, beautiful.	O doro anya na ọ dị mma, mara mma.
You are doing everything right now.	Ị na-eme ihe niile ugbu a.
With this, it really came for me.	Na nke a, ọ bịara n'ezie maka m.
He was asked about the path.	A jụrụ ya maka ụzọ.
Not true now.	Ọ bụghị eziokwu ugbu a.
If he wants to do it, he must do it.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ chọrọ ime, ọ ga-eme.
This movie might be good.	Ihe nkiri a nwere ike ịdị mma.
That is the only reason he is here.	Ọ bụ naanị ya mere o ji nọrọ ebe a.
It is the body.	Ọ bụ ahụ.
But he was angry.	Ma ọ were iwe.
This city is a favorite vacation spot.	Obodo a bụ ebe ezumike kacha amasị.
It is hypocritical.	Ọ bụ ụdị ihu abụọ.
Kids love it.	Ụmụaka na-amasị ya.
And so on.	Na ihe ọzọ.
It has many awesome styles.	O nwere ọtụtụ ụdị dị egwu.

And you will not.	Na ị gaghị eme.
That was not the case last year.	O nweghị nke ahụ n'afọ gara aga.
Our back will go.	Azụ anyị ga-aga.
This is a very strong city.	Nke a bụ obodo siri ezigbo ike.
It's really long on the skin.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ogologo na akpụkpọ.
Then the work went on a lot.	Mgbe ahụ, ọrụ gara n'ihu nke ukwuu.
He was there.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ.
Often it is money.	Ọtụtụ mgbe ọ bụ ego.
Is it dangerous.	Ọ dị egwu.
The place is beautiful.	Ebe ahụ mara mma.
This is true.	Nke a bụ eziokwu.
I have a feeling for it.	Enwere m mmetụta maka ya.
It is a different city.	Ọ bụ obodo dị iche.
I never asked any questions.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m jụrụ ajụjụ ọ bụla.
Or his father.	Ma ọ bụ nna ya.
Everything works fine.	Ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Everything will be all right.	Ihe niile ga-adị ezigbo mma.
But the need is not small.	Ma mkpa abụghị obere ihe.
Does this drug really work?	Ọgwụ a ọ na-arụ ọrụ n'ezie?
He said he had just bought the boat.	O kwuru na ya ka zụtara ụgbọ mmiri a.
The name is everything.	Aha bụ ihe niile.
I can not.	Enweghị m ike.
We all can.	Anyị niile nwere ike.
We were quick to acknowledge.	Anyị mere ngwa ngwa ikweta.
They are always there.	Ha dị mgbe ọ bụla.
We should have one or the other.	Anyị kwesịrị inwe otu ma ọ bụ nke ọzọ.
This is not a resting-place.	Nke a abụghị ebe izu ike.
From dawn to dusk, the children run along the beach.	Site n'ụtụtụ ruo n'isi ụtụtụ, ụmụaka ahụ na-agba ọsọ n'akụkụ osimiri.
If the story seems to be complete, be skeptical.	Ọ bụrụ na akụkọ dị ka nke zuru oke, nwee obi abụọ.
They move forward just in front of us.	Ha na-aga n'ihu naanị n'ihu anyị.
Some are strong and some are weak.	Ụfọdụ siri ike ma ụfọdụ adịghị ike.
For better, for worse, we are here.	Maka mma, maka njọ, ebe a ka anyị nọ.
We were angry and scared.	Anyị were iwe na ụjọ.
She is a woman, not a girl.	Ọ bụ nwanyị, ọ bụghị nwa agbọghọ.
To find what you deserve.	Ka ịchọta ihe kwesịrị gị.
In practice, of course, these two things are not true.	Na omume, n'ezie, ihe abụọ a abụghị eziokwu.
This is the only way.	Nke a bụ naanị ụzọ.
Should be good enough ?.	Kwesịrị ịdị mma nke ọma?.
There is nothing here for him.	Ọ dịghị ihe ebe a maka ya.
I think this is a good idea.	Echere m na nke a bụ ezi echiche.
You always know where he is.	Ị mara ebe ọ dị mgbe niile.
He is a very handsome man.	Ọ bụ nwoke mara mma nke ukwuu.
So he stopped talking about the girls with her.	N'ihi ya, ọ kwụsịrị ikwu banyere ụmụ agbọghọ ya na ya.
Nothing more.	Ọ dịghị ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
This food is not good for the heart.	Nri a adịghị mma maka obi.
That is what he did all his life.	Ọ bụ ihe o mere ná ndụ ya niile.
It will not be easy.	Ọ gaghị adị mfe.
I feel like they didn’t.	Enwere m mmetụta na ha emeghị.
There are many more.	Enwere ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ.
It's really funny.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ihe ọchị.
They do not do it again.	Ha anaghị eme ya ọzọ.
Stop back several times to see something new.	Kwụsị azụ ugboro ugboro ka ịhụ ihe dị ọhụrụ.
You are not just a coward.	Ị bụghị naanị onye ụjọ.
I can't help it.	Enweghị m ike inyere ya aka.
Or so, too.	Ma ọ bụ otú ahụ, nke ukwuu.
The reason is unknown.	Amaghị ihe kpatara ya.
It has fish behind all of this.	Ọ nwere ihe azụ na ihe a niile.
You know what men look like.	Ị maara otú ụmụ nwoke si dị.
But it's a little bit.	Mana ọ bụ ntakịrị ihe.
Or their faces.	Ma ọ bụ ihu ha.
What’s best for you and me.	Kedu ihe kacha mma maka mụ na gị.
Of course it is clear.	N'ezie o doro anya.
It was almost perfect.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ nke ọma.
He came to that.	Ọ bịara na nke ahụ.
Do not think this day will come.	Echeghị na ụbọchị a ga-abịa.
Good times.	Oge dị mma.
I think it was his favorite song.	Echere m na ọ bụ egwu kacha amasị ya.
Maybe you feel better.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị gị mma.
Not that we are afraid.	Ọ bụghị na anyị na-atụ egwu.
The airport building can be seen in the distance.	Enwere ike ịhụ ụlọ ọdụ ụgbọ elu n'ebe dị anya.
He never saw any of it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ hụrụ nke ọ bụla n'ime ya.

He could not succeed a second time.	Ọ nweghị ike ịga nke ọma nke ugboro abụọ.
It surprised me to the end.	Ọ tụrụ m n'anya ruo n'isi.
They had a son.	Ha mụrụ nwa nwoke.

He loved his game.	Ọ hụrụ egwuregwu ya n'anya.

He was very angry when he heard the news.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu na ọ nụrụ akụkọ ahụ.
I can take it.	Enwere m ike were ya.
She is OK.	Ọ dị ya mma.
All new laws, old laws.	Iwu ọhụrụ niile, iwu ochie.
Sometimes it lasts a minute, sometimes just a few minutes.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ na-aga otu nkeji, mgbe ụfọdụ naanị nkeji ole na ole.
Not a good idea.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo echiche.

Many of them are interested in this.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha nwere mmasị na nke a.

A hard day needs a delicious dinner.	Ụbọchị siri ike chọrọ nri abalị na-atọ ụtọ.
Of course, they should do little things.	N'ezie, ha kwesịrị ime obere ihe.
Only two of his works are still alive.	Naanị abụọ n'ime ọrụ ya ka dị ndụ.
All is not well.	Ihe niile adịghị mma.

They want to help people everywhere.	Ha chọrọ inyere ụmụ mmadụ aka n'ebe niile.
This is true for everyone.	Nke a bụ eziokwu maka onye ọ bụla.
But that did not stop him.	Ma nke ahụ emeghị ka ọ pụọ.
The car should go right, to the left.	Ụgbọ ala kwesịrị ịga n'aka nri, na-enweghị isi.
They are wise.	Ha mara ihe.

Now that’s not bad is it? 	Ugbu a nke ahụ adịghị njọ ka ọ bụ?
But how he said it.	Ma otú o si gwa ya.
But things are good.	Ma ihe dị mma.
It will not happen.	Ọ gaghị eme.
He had these feelings on his own.	O nwere mmetụta ndị a n'onwe ya.
Good team there, good team here.	Ezigbo otu n'ebe ahụ, ezigbo otu nọ ebe a.
The time limit is limited.	Onyinye oge nwere oke.
His father worked as a car mechanic.	Nna ya na-arụ ọrụ ụgbọ ala.
He just wants to get everyone to stop fighting.	Ọ ga-achọ naanị ime ka onye ọ bụla kwụsị ọgụ.
Dogs are known to be good friends.	A maara nkịta ka ọ bụrụ ezigbo enyi mmadụ.
It is beautiful in this.	Ọ mara mma na nke a.
Is it dangerous.	Ọ dị egwu.
If you want, please eat.	Ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ, biko rie.
The reason is simple.	Ihe kpatara ya doro anya.
He does not like to play.	Ọ naghị amasị ya igwu egwu.
Clearly, of course.	N'ụzọ doro anya, n'ezie.
One big too.	Otu nnukwu kwa.
But to me, it was quite different.	Ma n'ebe m nọ, ọ dị nnọọ iche.
His clothes are bags.	Uwe ya bụ akpa.
Or in the industry.	Ma ọ bụ na ụlọ ọrụ.
What is happening here is very important.	Ihe na-eme ebe a dị ezigbo mkpa.
It can be used on wet shoes.	Enwere ike iji ya mee ihe na akpụkpọ ụkwụ mmiri.
Hopefully we can get some pictures of that.	Olileanya na anyị nwere ike nweta ụfọdụ foto nke ahụ.

This is a beautiful place.	Nke a bụ ebe mara mma.
It's very nice.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mma.

I have to tell someone, everyone.	Ekwesịrị m ịgwa mmadụ, onye ọ bụla.

Children run around.	Ụmụaka na-agba ọsọ gburugburu.

Everything was cold.	Ihe niile jụrụ oyi.
They are things you can really feel.	Ha bụ ihe ndị ị nwere ike inwe mmetụta n'ezie.
Things are really good.	Ihe dị ezigbo mma.

That's all.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị.

You are in a different place now.	Ị nọ n'ebe dị iche ugbu a.
Everything is going well in this regard.	Ihe niile na-aga nke ọma n'akụkụ a.
He did not know where the green went.	Ọ maghị ebe akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ gara.
We need strength.	Anyị chọrọ ịdị ike.

That was a very important interview.	Nke ahụ bụ ajụjụ ọnụ dị mkpa n'ezie.
But you now know that this is to be expected.	Mana ị mara ugbu a nke a na-atụ anya ya.
We do not want to leave here.	Anyị achọghị ịpụ n'ebe a.

This is important for two reasons.	Nke a dị mkpa maka ihe abụọ.
But that, you want to be different, is how things work.	Ma nke ahụ, ị ​​ga-achọ iche, bụ ka ihe si arụ ọrụ.

For this reason, we value the student's opinion.	N'ihi nke a, anyị ji echiche nwa akwụkwọ ahụ kpọrọ ihe.
He could not, but he would actually do something.	O nweghị ike, ma ọ bụ n'ezie ọ ga-eme ihe.

You became very close friends when you were children.	Unu abụọ nwere nnọọ enyi mgbe unu bụ ụmụaka.

When they entered the room.	Mgbe ha banyere n'ime ụlọ.

At the same time, it was a big year.	N'otu oge ahụ, ọ bụ nnukwu afọ.

That’s easier said than done, of course.	Nke ahụ dị mfe ikwu karịa ime, n'ezie.
So, we have to do it ourselves.	N’ihi ya, anyị kwesịrị iji aka anyị mee ihe.

And one day everything will be fine.	Na otu ụbọchị ihe niile ga-adị mma.
Only I can do this.	Ọ bụ naanị m nwere ike ime nke a.

You said he gave it to you.	I kwuru na o nyere gị ya.

The mothers of these children went on vacation.	Nne ụmụaka ndị a gara ezumike.

Of course it is clear.	N'ezie o doro anya.

The difference is true in this case.	Ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu na nke a.
Quickly, he thought this was impossible.	Ngwa ngwa, o chere na nke a agaghị ekwe omume.
If so, you are right.	Ọ bụrụ otu a, ị kwuru eziokwu.
You cannot do just one thing and not another.	Ị gaghị eme naanị otu ihe ma ọ bụghị nke ọzọ.
However, something different happened.	Otú ọ dị, ihe dị iche mere.
That is where morality comes in.	Nke ahụ bụ ebe omume dị.

Otherwise, it is not a bad thing.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ bụghị ihe ọjọọ.
I don’t see a big difference really.	Ahụghị m nnukwu ihe dị iche n'ezie.
You will never see it again.	Ị gaghị ahụ ya ọzọ.

That was just this morning.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị ụtụtụ a.
Everything is like water like the river.	Ihe niile dị ka mmiri dị ka osimiri ahụ.
The popular road plan is different from this.	Atụmatụ ụzọ a ma ama dị iche na nke a.
He only sat for two minutes.	Ọ bụ naanị nkeji abụọ ka ọ nọrọ ọdụ.
You can run during those times for the week.	Ị nwere ike ịgba ọsọ n'oge ndị ahụ maka izu.

You will do what you like.	Ị ga-eme ihe na-amasị gị.

The machine was there the day before and now it is not.	Igwe ahụ dị ebe ahụ ụbọchị gara aga ma ugbu a ọ bụghị.
Next week, they may see another girl.	N'izu na-abịa, ha nwere ike ịhụ nwa agbọghọ ọzọ.
They say he doesn't do well.	Ha na-ekwu na ọ naghị eme nke ọma.
Many roads and rivers were flooded.	Mmiri juru ọtụtụ ụzọ na osimiri.
Abortion is a fight.	Ime bụ ọgụ.

You should know.	Ị kwesịrị ịma.
Some species can eat anything.	Ụdị ụfọdụ nwere ike iri ihe ọ bụla.
I told them again.	Agwara m ha ọzọ.
One way or another, the man should get out.	Otu ụzọ ma ọ bụ ọzọ, nwoke ahụ kwesịrị ịpụ.
You can not do that.	Ị nweghị ike ime nke ahụ.
Or in it.	Ma ọ bụ na ya.

It makes things easier.	Ọ na-eme ka ihe dị mfe.
He should not do it.	O kwesịghị ime ya.
Not good, but cheap.	Ọ bụghị mma, ma ọnụ ala.
He died in his work.	Ọ nwụrụ na-arụ ọrụ ya.
I don’t care who he is or who did it.	Achọghị m ịma onye ọ bụ ma ọ bụ onye mere ya.
There is happiness.	A na-enwe obi ụtọ.
They would have known that this was not the time for now.	Ha gaara ama na ọ bụghị nke a nwa oge ugbu a.
They want something.	Ha chọrọ ihe.
Beautiful !.	Nke mara mma!.
The passengers left early in the morning.	Ndị njem ahụ pụrụ n’isi ụtụtụ.
He knew it was good.	Ọ maara na ọ dị mma.
The fish were swimming fast through the water.	Azụ ahụ nọ na-egwu mmiri ngwa ngwa site na mmiri.
I told him on the phone.	Agwara m ya na ekwentị.

You have value.	Ị nwere uru.
That is what they are well aware of.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ha na-ama nke ọma.
People can be good.	Ndị mmadụ nwere ike ịdị mma.
The situation is dire.	Ọnọdụ ahụ siri ike.
There are two important cities in this country.	Obodo abụọ dị mkpa dị na mba a.
The other three got three each.	Otu atọ ọzọ nwetara atọ nke ọ bụla.
So it would seem that he had left there.	Ya mere ọ ga-adị ka ọ hapụrụ ebe ahụ.
I know something different.	Amaara m ihe dị iche.
I think all fathers do that.	Echere m na ndị nna niile na-eme nke ahụ.
Stop the car!	Kwụsị ụgbọ ala!
No more suffering.	Enweghị ahụhụ ọzọ.
Women do.	Ụmụ nwanyị na-eme.
I don’t think it will happen.	Echeghị m na ọ ga-eme.
But they had two more problems.	Ma ha nwere nsogbu abụọ ọzọ.
It should be a good thing to have a job for life.	Ọ kwesịrị ịbụ ihe dị mma inwe ọrụ maka ndụ.
We are here.	Anyị nọ ebe a.
And as a student who is very close to me.	Na dị ka nwa akwụkwọ nke dị m ezigbo nso.
But there is nothing there.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla n'ebe ahụ.
Therefore, there is no situation for anyone to use it.	Ya mere, ọ nweghị ọnọdụ onye ọ bụla ga-eji ya mee ihe.
Music is one example.	Egwu bụ otu ihe atụ.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
The boy ran away alone.	Nwa nwoke ahụ gbara ọsọ naanị ya.
Any case does not do so.	Ikpe ọ bụla adịghị eme otú ahụ.
Forgiveness?	Mgbaghara?
Just see, this is you.	Naanị hụ, nke a bụ gị.
He runs with my family.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ na ezinụlọ m.
This is true.	Nke a bụ eziokwu.
A woman can make the first trip.	Nwanyị nwere ike ime njem mbụ.
It's a different game.	Ọ bụ otu egwuregwu dị iche.
Two customers, both women, are inside.	Ndị ahịa abụọ, ma ụmụ nwanyị, nọ n'ime.
You are everything to them.	Ị bụ ihe niile nye ha.
The president talks about everything.	Onye isi ala na-ekwu maka ihe niile.
Something terrible happened.	Ihe dị egwu mere.
Not that it matters, of course.	Ọ bụghị na ọ dị mkpa, n'ezie.
It is made of wood.	E ji osisi mee ya.
This meeting is spring time.	Nzukọ a bụ oge mmiri.
It's just a small thing.	Ọ bụ naanị obere ihe.
That's my passion.	Nke ahụ bụ mmasị m.
It could be environmental issues.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe gbasara gburugburu.
That is what you said.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe i kwuru.
I don’t want it to stop.	Achọghị m ka ọ kwụsị.
Come on in, take a look.	Bịa, nwee ụfọdụ.
Give the greater good of their own.	Nye ihe ndị ka ukwuu ohere nke ha.
But only to one point.	Mana naanị ruo otu isi.
Four patients died.	Ndị ọrịa anọ nwụrụ.
They speak your word.	Ha na-ekwu okwu gị.
We didn’t do them, but we saw them play.	Anyị emeghị ha, ma anyị hụrụ ka ha na-egwu egwu.
Probably well.	Eleghị anya nke ọma.
We go, we are scared, we talk.	Anyị na-aga, na-atụ egwu, na-ekwu okwu.
Please help me with this.	Biko nyere m aka na nke a.
And city life is different from city life.	Na ndụ obodo dị iche na ndụ obodo.
Then, of course, there is the small talk of debt.	Mgbe ahụ, n'ezie, enwere obere okwu nke ụgwọ.
What we did with it.	Ihe anyị mere na ya.
Most women here have one or two children.	Ọtụtụ ụmụ nwanyị nọ ebe a nwere otu nwa ma ọ bụ abụọ.
But those are just words.	Mana ndị ahụ bụ naanị okwu.
But there is more to the threat here.	Mana enwere ihe ndị ọzọ dị n'ihe egwu ebe a.
We have to play with the rules.	Anyị ga-eji iwu egwu egwu.
There are a few problems along the way.	Enwere nsogbu ole na ole n'ụzọ.
They really deserve it.	Ha kwesịrị ya n'ezie.
And not only this.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị nke a.
This is the only thing we can do.	Nke a bụ naanị ihe anyị nwere ike ime.
I think it was for me.	Echere m na ọ bụ ya maka m.
Fortunately, he got there quickly.	N'ụzọ dị mma, ọ bịara n'ebe ahụ ngwa ngwa.
I know some people love them.	Amaara m na ụfọdụ hụrụ ha n'anya.
None of them had any money.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha nwere ego ọ bụla.
Then the other two began on their feet.	Mgbe ahụ, ndị ọzọ abụọ malitere ụkwụ ha.
Better than nothing.	Ka mma karịa ihe ọ bụla.
I could not get out of there quickly.	Enweghị m ike isi ebe ahụ pụọ ngwa ngwa.
Sometimes it does.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, o mere.
But want to know why.	Ma chọọ ịma ihe kpatara ya.
You do not see.	Ị naghị ahụ.
It is time for the party.	O rutere n'oge maka oriri ahụ.
The men.	Ụmụ nwoke ndị ahụ.
So we do.	Ya mere, anyị na-eme.
This is a fantastic idea.	Nke a bụ echiche dị egwu.
He could not.	O nweghị ike.
Stay close.	Nọrọ nso.
Working all the time.	Na-arụ ọrụ mgbe ọ bụla.
Sometimes they are right.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha kwuru eziokwu.
No matter.	N'agbanyeghị ihe.
This happened many times.	Nke a mere ọtụtụ oge.
No speed bumps.	Enweghị ọsọ ọkụ.
Everything he did was for him.	Ihe niile o mere bụ maka ya.
I don't like everything.	Enweghị m mmasị na ihe niile.
That scared me.	Nke ahụ tụrụ m ụjọ.
Of course, people want these stories.	N'ezie, ndị mmadụ chọrọ akụkọ ndị a.
It makes sense.	O nwere isi.
Because there your heart is.	N'ihi na ebe ahụ ka obi gị dị.
They think that he does not miss it.	Ha chere na ọ naghị atụ uche ya.
Now that will be news.	Ugbu a nke ahụ ga-abụ akụkọ.
To me, that says a lot.	Nye m, nke ahụ na-ekwu ọtụtụ ihe.
I think this will make the game better.	Echere m na nke a ga-eme ka egwuregwu ahụ ka mma.
The man knew nothing.	Nwoke ahụ amaghị ihe ọ bụla.
But then, too, there is a new game application.	Ma mgbe ahụ, kwa, enwere ngwa egwuregwu ọhụrụ.
Every day, the race is still the same.	Kwa ụbọchị, ịgba ọsọ ahụ ka dị otu.
Everything happens so fast.	Ihe niile na-eme ngwa ngwa.
Water is not good for the river.	Mmiri mmiri adịghị mma maka osimiri.
It is important that you do well.	Ọ dị mkpa na ị na-eme nke ọma.
It's just that we don't do it.	Ọ bụ naanị na anyị anaghị eme ya.
We all do.	Anyị niile na-eme.
Whatever you want.	Ihe ọ bụla ị chọrọ.
They are just what happened.	Ha bụ naanị ihe merenụ.
Such fears bring us joy.	Egwu ndị dị otú ahụ na-eme anyị obi ụtọ.
It was not unusual at that time.	Ọ bụghị ihe a na-eme n'oge ahụ.
However, I know this may not be an opportunity.	Otú ọ dị, amaara m na nke a apụghị ịbụ ohere.
But we have information here.	Mana anyị nwere ozi ebe a.
Two things are simple.	Ihe abụọ dị mfe.
He will do it.	Ọ ga-eme ya.
The country will still need doctors in the coming years.	Mba ahụ ka ga-achọ ndị dọkịta n'afọ ndị na-abịa.
Others seemed to understand my point of view.	Ndị ọzọ yiri ka ha ghọtara echiche m.
All is not well here.	Ihe niile adịghị mma ebe a.
But to no avail.	Ma ọ dịghị uru.
Which is very new to me.	Nke bụ nnọọ ihe ọhụrụ nye m.
That is awesome!	Nke ahụ dị egwu!
I still have a picture of that.	M ka nwere foto nke ahụ.
He was a vegetarian.	Ọ bụ onye anaghị eri anụ.
It looks like the girl we left here.	Ọ dị ka nwa agbọghọ anyị hapụrụ ebe a.
People are very excited about it.	Ndị mmadụ nwere nnukwu obi ụtọ maka ya.
Or, of course, scary.	Ma ọ bụ, n'ezie, egwu.
There are a lot of lights on the black market.	Enwere ọtụtụ ọkụ ọkụ na ahịa ojii.
It's a joke.	Ọ bụ ihe egwuregwu.
In his year.	N'afọ ya.
Sometimes they are pointless.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha enweghị isi.
I have no money right now.	Enweghị m ego ọ bụla ugbu a.
He almost doesn't see it now.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ ghara ịhụ ya ugbu a.
No, that is not true.	Mba, nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
Or some other group somewhere.	Ma ọ bụ otu ndị ọzọ ụfọdụ ebe ọzọ.
He hated himself more than anything.	Ọ kpọrọ onwe ya asị karịa ihe ọ bụla.
Everyone here is doing it.	Onye ọ bụla nọ ebe a na-eme ya.
But you have to be prepared for it.	Mana ị ga-adị njikere maka ya.
There is only one more opportunity.	Enwere naanị otu ohere ọzọ.
We are in this house.	Anyị nọ n'ụlọ a.
Keep my mind simple '.	Mee ka uche m dị mfe'.
It was tough and ready.	Ọ bụ ihe siri ike ma dị njikere.
They are really cheap.	Ha dị ọnụ ala n'ezie.
Absolutely perfect.	Zuru oke zuru oke.
There is no fear.	Enweghị egwu.
It seems so.	Ọ dị ka ya mere.
The house is small.	Ụlọ dị obere.
It was just that time began.	Ọ bụ naanị na oge malitere.
There is no way you can survive if things continue that way.	Ọ nweghị ụzọ ị ga-esi dị ndụ ma ọ bụrụ na ihe aga n'ihu otu ahụ.
He received authority from his children.	O nwetara ikike n'aka ụmụ ya.
Either way important.	N'ụzọ ọ bụla dị mkpa.
This city is known for its beauty.	A maara obodo a maka ịma mma ya.
The big room collapsed.	Nnukwu ọnụ ụlọ dara.
I will have some.	M ga-enwe ụfọdụ.
I am on sick leave.	Anọ m na ezumike ọrịa.
We are very impressed.	Ọ masịrị anyị nke ukwuu.
I fell forward, in front of me.	M dara n'ihu, n'ihu m.
I hope you like it !.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ masịrị gị!.
Both of these require many hours of work.	Ihe abụọ a chọrọ ọtụtụ awa mmadụ.
Give it to me.	Nye m ya.
For some reason you do not know my real name.	O nwere ihe mere na ị maghị ezigbo aha m.
Anything.	Ihe ọ bụla.
That was the reason for my stomach feeling.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe kpatara mmetụta afọ m.
Which, to be honest, could be.	Nke, iji bụrụ eziokwu, ọ nwere ike.

Come to my room.	Bịa n'ọnụ ụlọ m.
For an hour's sleep.	Maka ụra otu awa.
This happened immediately inside.	Nke a mere ozugbo n'ime.
She hopes to meet someone she knows here.	Ọ tụrụ anya ịhụ onye ọ maara ebe a.
It was a feast.	Ọ bụ oriri.

It includes two features.	O tinyere atụmatụ abụọ.
Very well.	Ọ dị mma nke ukwuu.
Please see.	Biko hụ .
Those are mine.	Ndị ahụ bụ nke m.
Now we are here.	Ugbu a, anyị nọ ebe a.
They have the ability to disappear.	Ha nwere ikike na-enweghị atụ ịpụ n'anya.
Why do they want to talk to him? 	Gịnị mere ha ji chọọ ịgwa ya okwu?
I'm sure it will be good at home soon !.	Eji m n'aka na ọ ga-adị mma na ụlọ n'oge na-adịghị anya!.
Obviously the station is not working.	O doro anya na ọdụ ụgbọ ala adịghị arụ ọrụ.
I think that's why it's used like this.	Echere m na nke ahụ bụ ihe e ji mee otu a.
He does things.	Ọ na-eme ihe.
Two years, three years, four years.	Afọ abụọ, afọ atọ, afọ anọ.

I do not know anything about it.	Amaghị m ihe ọ bụla gbasara ya.
It is not that simple.	Ọ dịghị mfe otú ahụ.
But it is good.	Ma ọ dị mma.
Suddenly there was a fire in the house.	Ọkụ dị n'ime ụlọ ahụ na mberede.
This shirt is so cute!	Uwe elu a mara mma nke ukwuu!

In the past, we have never said this.	N'oge gara aga, ọ dịghị mgbe anyị kwuru nke a.
Eat whatever you like right now.	Rie ihe ọ bụla masịrị gị ugbu a.

It took a lot of opportunities.	O were ọtụtụ ohere.
I can make him happy.	Enwere m ike ime ya obi ụtọ.
The first color is worse.	Agba nke mbụ ka njọ.
Looking forward to the trip.	Na-atụ anya njem nke ukwuu.
Give him permission to do it.	Nye ya ikike enwere ike ime ya.
Many things can make a difference.	Ọtụtụ ihe nwere ike ime ka ihe dị iche.
He runs immediately in his life.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ ozugbo na ndụ ya.
No one saw it.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya.
It will not be difficult.	Ọ gaghị esi ike.
The water should be hot now.	Mmiri kwesịrị ịdị ọkụ ugbu a.
He runs and has a good time.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ ma nwee oge dị mma.
Of course not.	Ọ bụghị n'ezie.
He would not tell me much about it.	Ọ gaghị agwa m ọtụtụ ihe banyere ya.
This language has no word for that.	Asụsụ a enweghị okwu maka nke ahụ.
I do not know anything about this.	Amaghị m ihe ọ bụla banyere nke a.
Staff are required to attend meetings.	A chọrọ ka ndị ọrụ na-aga nzukọ.

It would be hard to say.	Ọ ga-esi ike ikwu.
And so on.	Ha wee gaa n’ihu.
Wherever they are most wise.	Ebe ọ bụla ha kacha mara ihe.
The way is clear at all times.	Ụzọ ahụ doro anya n'oge niile.
The man ran away.	Nwoke ahụ gbara ọsọ.
Next, he made sure he could leave work early.	Ọzọ, o mere ya ka o nwee ike ịpụ n'ọrụ n'oge.
But when you do, make it as easy as you can.	Ma mgbe ị na-eme ya, mee ka ọ dị mfe ma ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike.
Well, they told him.	Ọ dị mma, ha gwara ya.
But I think it's true.	Ma echere m na ọ bụ eziokwu.
He did not want to say anything.	Ọ chọghị ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
I know it is useful.	Ama m na ọ bara uru.
Maybe he doesn’t need to be here for this.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dịghị mkpa ka ọ nọrọ ebe a maka nke a.
It is a civil court.	Ọ bụ ụlọ ikpe obodo.
We fell.	Anyị dara.

During the trip, his only concern was his mother.	N'oge njem ahụ, naanị echiche ya bụ nne ya.
No matter what his mother may say.	N'agbanyeghị ihe nne ya nwere ike ikwu.
You are a good friend.	Ị bụ ezigbo enyi.

That’s kind of funny, and hilarious.	Nke ahụ bụ ụdị ihe ọchị, na ihe ọchị.

Nothing, of course.	Enweghị ihe ọ bụla, n'ezie.

He now has only one job.	O nwere naanị otu ọrụ ugbu a.

That is very beautiful.	Nke ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
It is because they like you.	Ọ bụ n'ihi na ha masịrị gị.
For the family.	Maka ezinụlọ.

He was the only one alive inside the ark.	Ọ bụ naanị ya dị ndụ n'ime ụgbọ ahụ.

He does not know what happened.	Ọ maghị ihe merenụ.

This book is just a book.	Akwụkwọ a bụ naanị akwụkwọ.

No other ideas required.	Enweghị echiche ọzọ achọrọ.

We went from his house to the restaurant.	Anyị si n'ụlọ ya gaa n'ụlọ nri.

There is no need to be angry now.	O nweghị uru iwe iwe ugbu a.
One man asked his mother where the babies were coming from.	Otu nwoke jụrụ nne ya ebe ụmụ ọhụrụ si bịa.
They do not like each other, they say.	Ha adịghị amasị ibe ha, ha na-ekwu.
Maybe he thought you were an old friend.	Ma eleghị anya, o chere na ị bụ enyi ochie.
He knew that the city could not go that way.	Ọ maara na obodo ahụ enweghị ike ịga n'ụzọ dị otú a.
He told her that she would not be there.	Ọ gwara ya na ya agaghị anọ.
Those were the last few minutes of his life.	Ndị ahụ bụ nkeji ole na ole ikpeazụ nke ndụ ya.
This bride surrounds her loved ones.	Nwunye a na-agba ndị ọ hụrụ n'anya gburugburu.
This meeting will be minutes apart.	Nzukọ a ga-enwe nkeji nkeji.
But it seems that he enjoys work.	Ma ọ dị ka ọrụ ọ na-atọ ya ụtọ.
Thought he would live!	Echere na ọ ga-adị ndụ!
His story does not exist.	Akụkọ ya adịghị.
I know this is a bad time.	Ama m na nke a bụ oge ọjọọ.
Maybe it's true.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ eziokwu.
There is a difference.	E nwere ihe dị iche.
Good job.	Ezigbo ọrụ.
And we can go home.	Na anyị nwere ike ịla n'ụlọ.
Most of them are women.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha bụ ụmụ nwanyị.
It is just what we do.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe anyị na-eme.

We could have seen the water.	Anyị gaara ahụ mmiri ahụ.
The game is on fire.	Egwuregwu ahụ gbara ọkụ.
Whatever they do, it works.	Ihe ọ bụla ha na-eme, ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
This power is within everyone.	Ikike a dị n'ime onye ọ bụla.
There are many houses.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụlọ.
You are doing your job for them.	Ị na-arụ ọrụ gị n'ebe ha nọ.
They are clear.	Ha doro anya.
Movie and wine.	Ihe nkiri na mmanya.
It was the first time he had seen the tree nearby.	Ọ bụ nke mbụ ọ hụrụ osisi ahụ n'ebe dị nso.
He invites them over for a meal.	Ọ kpọrọ ha niile ka ha na ya rie oriri.
So, a few weeks ago.	Ya mere, izu ole na ole gara aga.
We made a lot of money.	Anyị nwetara nnukwu ego.
You can't do that.	Ị gaghị eme ụdị ihe ahụ.

It was the first time he had thought about it.	Ọ bụ oge mbụ ọ na-eche banyere ya.
No one knows where he is.	O nweghị onye ma ebe ọ nọ.
That is long.	Nke ahụ dị ogologo.
Does this have any water?	Nke a ọ nwere mmiri ọ bụla?
These places, they have a new feeling.	Ebe ndị a, ha nwere mmetụta ọhụrụ.
Only the lies of the land are unknown.	Naanị ụgha nke ala ahụ amaghị.
He was upset by what his mother said.	Ihe nne ya kwuru were ya iwe.
However, this is not the case.	Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị ikpe.
But there is an easier way, too.	Mana enwere ụzọ dị mfe, kwa.
It was a great place for us to talk.	Ọ bụ ebe dị mma maka anyị ikwu okwu.
She nervously waited for the doctor's report.	O ji ụjọ chere akụkọ dọkịta.

Of course, both cannot be true.	Na o doro anya na ha abụọ enweghị ike ịbụ eziokwu.
The man was wearing a sports shirt.	Nwoke ahụ yi uwe egwuregwu obere aka.
I am happy for that.	Enwere m obi ụtọ maka nke ahụ.
The store has beautiful clothes.	Ụlọ ahịa ahụ nwere uwe mara mma.
He could not follow this.	Ọ nweghị ike iso nke a.
He wants to leave.	Ọ chọrọ ka ọ pụọ.
So he did what he wanted to do.	N’ihi ya, o mere ihe ọ chọrọ ime.
But these days.	Mana ụbọchị ndị a.
She is happy to have it.	Obi dị ya ụtọ na o nwere.
Second, not for everyone.	Nke abụọ, ọ bụghị maka onye ọ bụla.
The country's airport is always threatened.	A na-atụ egwu ọdụ ụgbọ elu nke mba ahụ mgbe niile.

You arrive on time.	Ị na-abịa n'oge.
The man became angry and the meeting ended.	Iwe were nwoke ahụ na nzukọ ahụ kwụsịrị.
This seems to be happening.	Nke a yiri ihe na-eme ahụ.
He provided only bad food.	Ọ bụ naanị nri na-adịghị mma ka o nyere.

What an event.	Kedu ihe omume.
No work was found for the third.	Ọ nweghị ọrụ ahụrụ maka nke atọ.
She feels that she is used to it.	Ọ dị ya ka ọ̀ na-ama ya ahụ́.
Only three words.	Ọ bụ naanị okwu atọ.
This is a problem with that.	Nke a bụ nsogbu na nke ahụ.
I saw it right away.	Ahụrụ m ya ozugbo.
Before it was like a bad movie.	Tupu ọ dị ka ihe nkiri ọjọọ.
It seems to have left someone.	Ọ dị ka ọ hapụrụ mmadụ.

We make up.	Anyị na-eme ka elu.
The event did not go well.	Ihe omume ahụ emeghị nke ọma.
Just the same time.	Naanị otu oge ahụ.
Certainly not a good idea.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị ezi echiche.
Of course.	N'ezie.
You will want to be better.	Ị ga-achọ ka ị ka mma.
This is different.	Nke a dị iche.
Two problems, of course.	Nsogbu abụọ, n'ezie.
Most people do work that they do not like.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-arụ ọrụ na-adịghị amasị ha.
It happened to all of us.	O mere anyị niile.
I have a beautiful story.	Enwere m akụkọ mara mma.
However, many do not like their plans.	Otú ọ dị, ọtụtụ mmadụ adịghị amasị atụmatụ ha.
At one point, we did.	N'otu oge, anyị mere ya.
It was a good time.	Ọ bụ ezigbo oge.
I have something similar to you.	Enwere m ihe yiri onwe gị.
We will be there soon.	Anyị ga-anọ ebe ahụ n'oge adịghị anya.

He left when the police arrived.	Ọ pụọ mgbe ndị uwe ojii rutere.
I know him better than anyone.	M maara ya karịa onye ọ bụla.
He goes there.	Ọ na-aga ebe ahụ.
They can see everything from the home page.	Ha nwere ike ịhụ ihe niile site na ibe ụlọ.
How much does a new car cost?	Kedu ọnụ ahịa ụgbọ ala ọhụrụ?
He’s working on it.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ na ya.
This is their game.	Nke a bụ egwuregwu ha.
You have eye problems.	Ị nwere nsogbu anya.
People asked how it happened.	Ndị mmadụ jụrụ otú o si mee.
It will be here in a minute.	Ọ ga-anọ ebe a n'otu nkeji.
Somehow that made me feel good.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ nke ahụ dị m mma.
For our family.	Maka ezinụlọ anyị.
But they loved each other.	Ma ha hụrụ ibe ha n’anya.
They said it was worse than they thought.	Ha kwuru na ọ ka njọ karịa ka ha chere.
His heart and mind are in his hands.	Obi na uche ya dị ya n'aka.
Tonight there is no danger.	N'abalị a enweghị ihe egwu.
That is good.	Nke ahụ dị mma.
He asked many questions.	Ọ jụrụ ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
But the full range of opportunities is huge.	Ma ihe zuru oke nke ohere dị ukwuu.
Why not?	Gịnị kpatara na ị gaghị anọ.

It happened again and again.	O mere ugboro ugboro.
Maybe they stayed home.	Ma eleghị anya, ha nọrọ n'ụlọ.
But the inside is a very different story.	Ma nke dị n'ime bụ akụkọ dị nnọọ iche.
Practice can speak now.	Omume nwere ike ikwu okwu ugbu a.
He left the factory early in the morning to buy food.	Ọ hapụrụ ụlọ ọrụ ahụ n'isi ụtụtụ gaa zụta ihe oriri.
Not always.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ mgbe niile.
This is fun.	Nke a na-atọ ụtọ.
This can be done in two ways.	A ga-eme nke a n'ụzọ abụọ.
We want to know what will happen when they are together.	Anyị chọrọ ịma ihe ga-eme ma ha nọrọ ọnụ.
I need to see.	Ekwesịrị m ịhụ anya.
The higher one.	Onye elu.
We do.	Anyị na-eme.
I did not know it was the last.	Amaghị m na ọ bụ ikpeazụ.
I can say that.	Enwere m ike ikwu nke ahụ.
However, the effect is different for these two types.	Otú ọ dị, mmetụta dị iche maka ụdị abụọ a.
She could not cry.	O nweghị ike ibe ákwá.
Most refugees are not available for interview.	Ọtụtụ ndị gbara ọsọ ndụ anaghị adị maka ajụjụ ọnụ.
This is a powerful thing.	Nke a bụ ihe dị ike.
He nodded his head.	O kwere isi n'isi.
It will not be long.	Ọ gaghị adị ogologo.
He is afraid.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya.
One minute they will be needed.	Otu nkeji ha ga-adị mkpa.
I think of my mother.	M na-eche banyere nne m.
I will not back down.	Agaghị m ala azụ.
I was angry to say the least.	Iwe were m ikwu kacha nta.
However, there are two exceptions.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ihe abụọ dị iche.
It's too big.	Ọ dị oke.
Lots of emotions.	Ọtụtụ mmetụta uche.
They just want you to succeed.	Naanị ha chọrọ ka ị mee nke ọma.
You do not know how.	Ị maghị otú.
You feel no more.	Ị naghị enwe mmetụta ọzọ.
In the past, many languages ​​were spoken.	N'oge mbụ, a na-asụ ọtụtụ asụsụ.
I think we should call it that.	Echere m na anyị kwesịrị ịkpọ ya.
Then there will be no problems with the length of the months.	Mgbe ahụ, a gaghị enwe nsogbu na ogologo ọnwa dị iche iche.
And finally.	Na ikpeazụ ya.
We can go out.	Anyị nwere ike ịpụ.
It's not the way to go.	Ọ bụghị ụzọ aga.
Negative thoughts no matter what.	Echiche ọjọọ n'agbanyeghị ihe.
Well, he said.	Ọ dị mma, o kwuru.
You are beautiful.	I mara mma.
I need to go now.	Ekwesịrị m ịla ugbu a.
It should not be difficult.	O kwesịghị isi ike.
I feel like I know him.	Ọ dị m ka m̀ ma ya.
I can not say good things about it.	Enweghị m ike ikwu ezigbo ihe gbasara ya.
He is about 20 years old.	Ọ dị ka afọ iri abụọ ka ọ dị obere.
It will be the other use.	Ọ ga-abụ nke ọzọ eji.
I think that could go one of two ways.	Echere m na nke ahụ nwere ike ịga otu n'ime ụzọ abụọ.
It's not funny.	Ọ naghị akpa ọchị.
I looked everywhere.	M lere anya ebe niile.
Only women know now.	Naanị ụmụ nwanyị maara ugbu a.
He has a shop there, which is very important.	O nwere ụlọ ahịa nke ahụ, nke dị oke mkpa.
I have seen you since you came here.	Ahụrụ m gị kemgbe ị bịara ebe a.
Some had one child and some ten.	Ụfọdụ nwere otu nwa na ụfọdụ iri.
But no one else can do it.	Ma ọ dịghị onye ọzọ nwere ike ime ya.
A very sweet song with beautiful music.	Abụ dị ụtọ nke ukwuu nwere egwu mara mma.
People are afraid of me.	Ndị mmadụ na-atụ m ụjọ.
It could happen tomorrow.	O nwere ike ime echi.
There is another way behind this room.	Enwere ụzọ ọzọ n'azụ ọnụ ụlọ a.
It is important.	Ọ dị mkpa.
No one is good or bad.	Ọ dịghị onye dị mma ma ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ.
We are still there.	Anyị ka nọ.
I wondered how long he had been waiting for us.	M nọ na-eche ogologo oge ọ na-eche anyị.
I think you can call me a foodie.	Echere m na ị nwere ike ịkpọ m otu nri nri.
It was like crying.	Ọ dị ka ibe ákwá.
Man, as a difference of night and day.	Mmadụ, dị ka ihe dị iche na abalị na ehihie.
I saw fish nearby.	Ahụrụ m azụ̀ n'akụkụ ebe ahụ.
Most people in that city did not want that.	Ọtụtụ ndị obodo ahụ achọghị nke ahụ.
It is important.	Ọ dị mkpa.
It can be done.	Enwere ike ime ya.
No one said much.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru ọtụtụ ihe.
We live in a beautiful little house.	Anyị bi n'otu obere ụlọ mara mma.
He thought they were right.	O chere na ha bụ eziokwu.
But what places there.	Ma ihe ebe nwere.
It would not have happened by accident.	Agaraghị eme ya na mberede.
Really good time.	Oge ọma n'ezie.
No one spoke to him.	Ọ dịghị onye gwara ya okwu.
However, the door was uncertain.	Otú ọ dị, ọnụ ụzọ ejighị n'aka.
What else could it be?	Kedu ihe ọzọ nwere ike ịbụ?
He is the real one.	Ọ bụ ya bụ ezigbo ya.
Of course, it was my point.	N'ezie, ọ bụ isi okwu m.
I am very healthy.	Ahụ adị m mma nke ukwuu.
Not every night.	Ọ bụghị abalị ọ bụla.
There are.	Enwere.
The moon is coming.	Ọnwa na-abịa.
See an ambulance for someone who needs immediate help.	Hụ ụgbọ ihe mberede maka onye chọrọ enyemaka ngwa ngwa.
This is a test!	Nke a bụ ule!
I think there are two things in that.	Echere m na enwere ihe abụọ dị na nke ahụ.
I feel like something important is happening to me.	Enwere m mmetụta na ihe dị mkpa na-eme m.
I know my size.	Amaara m oke m.
No one knows who they are, or what they are doing.	Ọ dịghị onye maara ndị ha bụ, ma ọ bụ ihe ha na-eme.
It's a beauty.	Ọ bụ ịma mma.
Often people think positively.	Ọtụtụ mgbe ndị mmadụ na-eche echiche nke ọma.
No one expected the kind of weather that was good.	Ọ dịghị onye tụrụ anya ụdị ihu igwe dị mma.
He wondered how it was.	Ọ nọ na-eche otú ọ dị.
They are hungry.	Agụụ na-agụ ha.
You have to do this now.	Ị ga-eme nke a ugbu a.
You are told to do so.	A gwara gị mee otú ahụ.
We were all involved in cooking and packing.	E tinyere anyị niile n'ọrụ isi nri na ibu.
It is very easy to be a fire truck.	Ọ dị oke mfe ịbụ ụgbọ ọkụ.
Not just from disease.	Ọ bụghị naanị site na ọrịa.

It's a character.	Ọ bụ agwa.
See it for yourself.	Hụ ya n'onwe gị.
But it is still difficult.	Ma ọ ka siri ike.
I miss you all day long.	A na m atụ uche gị ụbọchị niile.
I want to know what people are saying.	Achọrọ m ịma ihe ndị mmadụ na-ekwu.
You are valuable.	Ị bara uru.
He looked.	O lere anya.
I can't see anything special in them.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla pụrụ iche na ha.
Love the idea.	Hụrụ echiche ahụ n'anya.
We went with that.	Anyị ji nke ahụ gaa.
I am very happy.	Obi dị m ụtọ nke ukwuu.
But no one will do it.	Ma ọ dịghị onye ga-eme ya.
I think this will help him a lot.	Echere m na nke a ga-enyere ya aka nke ukwuu.
These things happen regardless.	Ihe ndị a na-eme n'agbanyeghị.
But they are still suggesting opportunities.	Mana ha ka na-atụ aro ohere.
I was in school full time.	Anọ m n'ụlọ akwụkwọ oge niile.
He loves this.	Ọ hụrụ nke a n'anya.
And this is different.	Na nke a dị iche.
When was the last time you went to the beach?	Kedu mgbe ikpeazụ ị gara osimiri?
Baby what a difference.	Nwa kedu ihe dị iche.
I was angry because I was strong.	Iwe were m onwe m maka na m siri ike.
I was scared and frightened.	Enwere m ụjọ na ụjọ tụrụ m.
Only ten people attended.	Naanị mmadụ iri bịara okwu ahụ.

That surprised me.	Nke ahụ tụrụ m n'anya.
This house is like that.	Ụlọ a dị otú ahụ.
I am happy now.	Obi dị m ụtọ ugbu a.
He told you twice.	Ọ gwara gị ugboro abụọ.
The cost is a bit small.	Ọnụ ego ahụ dị ntakịrị ntakịrị.
The action plan is very useful.	Atụmatụ omume ahụ bara uru nke ukwuu.

But many did not.	Ma ọtụtụ emeghị.
I am very happy.	Obi dị m ụtọ nke ukwuu.
So it is not easy.	Ya mere ọ dịghị mfe.
They want to be family.	Ha chọrọ ịbụ ezinụlọ.
This is a lie.	Nke a bụ ụgha.
Everyone knows that.	Onye ọ bụla maara nke ahụ.
However, many of them are quite reasonable.	Otú ọ dị, ọtụtụ n'ime ha yiri nnọọ ezi uche.
It never happened.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ mere.

They can not do everything.	Ha enweghị ike ime ihe niile.
The fact is that it is not.	Nke bụ eziokwu bụ na ọ dịghị.
It is violent.	Ọ bụ ihe ike.
I can actually see his face.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ihu ya n'ezie.
You can not eat unhealthy food.	Ị nweghị ike iri nri na-adịghị mma.
It went easy.	Ọ gara n'ụzọ dị mfe.
That is a bigger problem.	Nke ahụ bụ nsogbu ka ukwuu.
I can't think this is legal.	Enweghị m ike iche na nke a bụ iwu.
The man was drinking.	Nwoke ahụ na-aṅụ mmanya.
He did not know any rules.	Ọ maghị iwu ọ bụla.
That will not happen to us.	Nke ahụ agaghị eme anyị.
But not his name either.	Ma ọ bụghị aha ya ma.
Just tell us when and where we will be there.	Naanị gwa anyị mgbe na ebe na anyị ga-anọ ebe ahụ.

Most of them are women of color.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha bụ ụmụ nwanyị agba.
This can happen within a few hours to a few days.	Nke a nwere ike ime n'ime awa ole na ole ruo ụbọchị ole na ole.

Everything is expensive now.	Ihe niile dị ọnụ ugbu a.
But his mouth.	Ma ọnụ ya.
I can give you a lot of food.	Enwere m ike inye gị nri nke ukwuu.
Just an example of something beyond your control.	Naanị otu ihe atụ nke ihe karịrị ike gị.

In this way, it is not so.	N'ụzọ dị otú a, ọ bụghị otú ahụ.

It should be used whenever possible.	Ekwesịrị iji ya mee ihe mgbe ọ bụla enwere ike.
It is within us and around us.	Ọ bụ n'ime anyị na gburugburu anyị.
Or whatever that is.	Ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla nke ahụ bụ.
He is afraid.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya.
The plan is simple.	Atụmatụ dị mfe.
He is doing well.	Ọ na-eme nke ọma.

Everyone has or has had a challenge.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ma ọ bụ nwee ihe ịma aka.
All this kind of thing.	Ụdị ihe a niile.
But he died 20 years ago.	Ma ọ nwụrụ afọ iri abụọ gara aga.

He says we are different from many others.	Ọ na-ekwu na anyị bụ ndị dị iche na ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ.
You can love it.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ya n'anya ya.
It is if.	Ọ bụ ma ọ bụrụ.
He got angry again.	Iwe were ya ọzọ.
This will not work.	Nke a agaghị arụ ọrụ.
They understood his language as soon as they heard it.	Ha ghọtara asụsụ ya ozugbo ha nụrụ ya.
That gave him some opportunities.	Nke ahụ mere ka o nweta ohere ụfọdụ.
That is not my house.	Nke ahụ abụghị ụlọ m.

It was him, boys, he thought.	Ọ bụ ya, ụmụ nwoke, o chere.
I think they hated me there.	Echere m na ha kpọrọ m asị ebe ahụ.

The other policemen looked on but were not impressed.	Ndị uwe ojii ndị ọzọ lere anya mana ha enweghị mmasị.

At this time, few houses were still in existence.	N'oge a, ụlọ ole na ole ka dị n'oge ahụ.
This is a great day for both of us.	Nke a bụ ezigbo ụbọchị maka ụdị anyị abụọ.
Everything, of course.	Ihe niile, n'ezie.
They can be a problem in any water temperature.	Ha nwere ike bụrụ nsogbu na mmiri ọ bụla nke okpomọkụ.
That is nonsense.	Nke ahụ bụ okwu nzuzu.
He did not know what he was doing.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ na-eme.
Thank you so much for your feedback.	Daalụ nke ukwuu maka echiche gị.
He gave a little.	O nyere ntakịrị.
Cold to head.	Oyi ruo isi.
Which is a little more than anything.	Nke dị ntakịrị karịa ihe ọ bụla.
That is no longer true.	Nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu ọzọ.
It was more than they told me to expect.	Ọ karịrị ihe ọ bụla ha gwara m ka m tụrụ anya ya.

Not only that, there are huge costs.	Ọ bụghị naanị nke ahụ, enwere nnukwu ụgwọ.
There was a big plane crash yesterday.	Enwere nnukwu ihe mberede ụgbọ elu ụnyahụ.
They are successful.	Ha na-aga nke ọma.
But this is very different.	Ma nke a dị nnọọ iche.
My opinion is that none of them are doing well.	Echiche m bụ na ọ dịghị nke na-eme nke ọma.
Not us, them.	Ọ bụghị anyị, ha.
Another old friend from school.	Enyi ochie ọzọ si ụlọ akwụkwọ.
It is their way of life.	Ọ bụ ụzọ ndụ ha.
When did he leave home?	Kedu oge ọ hapụrụ ụlọ?
When we are ready.	Mgbe anyị dị njikere.
Anything can happen, his hand is clear.	Ihe ọ bụla nwere ike ime, aka ya doro anya.
But today it did.	Ma taa o mere.
This is the last question.	Nke a bụ ajụjụ ikpeazụ.
The problem is, he needs to do more.	Nsogbu bụ, o kwesịrị ime obere ihe.
That was a short time ago.	Nke ahụ bụ obere oge gara aga.
But they did and we are here.	Mana ha mere ma anyị nọ ebe a.
They became addicted.	Ọnọdụ ọjọọ riri ha ahụ́.
Stay as long as you want.	Nọrọ ruo ogologo oge ịchọrọ.
The house is beautiful, but it is bad.	Ụlọ mara mma, mana ọ dị njọ.
I know he did that.	Ama m na o nwere mgbe o mere otú ahụ.
I miss my own, too.	A na m atụ uche nke m, kwa.
That is more powerful.	Nke ahụ dị ike karịa.
It is too good to be true.	Ọ dị oke mma ịbụ eziokwu.
It took a long time to get to the port.	O were ogologo oge ahụ iji gaa n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
That would be nice.	Nke ahụ ga-adị mma.
You have to be prepared for that.	Ị ga-adị njikere maka nke ahụ.
Go ahead, 'he said.	Gaa n'ihu,' ka o kwuru.
Not sure if they have.	Ejighị n'aka ma ha nwere.
They are good employees.	Ha bụ ezigbo ndị ọrụ.
Tell him that we want to talk to him.	Gwa ya na anyị chọrọ ịgwa ya okwu.
But this point is not important.	Mana isi okwu a adịghị mkpa.
For us, history is a story.	Maka anyị, akụkọ bụ akụkọ.
The same way.	Otu ụzọ ahụ.
We will have a party.	Anyị ga-eme oriri.
Let's eat, my old friend.	Ka anyị rie, enyi m ochie.
She is very nice and friendly.	Ọ mara ezigbo mma na enyi.
But just because it’s a story.	Mana naanị n'ihi na ọ bụ akụkọ akụkọ.
It seems.	Ọ dị ka.
He had many letters from a loved one.	O nwere ọtụtụ akwụkwọ ozi si n'aka onye ọ hụrụ n'anya.
You know me.	Ị maara m.
We were very cold.	Anyị jụrụ oyi nke ukwuu.
Some types of vegetables are good for you.	Ụdị akwụkwọ nri ụfọdụ dị mma maka gị.
What appeals to them is that they get it.	Ihe na-eme ka ha nwee mmasị bụ ime ka ha nweta.
He does nothing by accident.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ na-eme na mberede.
He speaks only his own hand.	Ọ na-asụ naanị aka ya.
However, they will act quickly.	Otú ọ dị, ha ga-eme ngwa ngwa.
She said it belonged to her mother.	O kwuru na ọ bụ nke nne ya.
The schools are very beautiful.	Ụlọ akwụkwọ ndị ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
I liked it, but she loved it.	Ọ masịrị m ụtọ, mana ọ hụrụ ya n'anya.
But you are so beautiful.	Mana ị mara oke mma.
If we had been there.	A sị na anyị gaara anọ ebe ahụ.
He was obviously expecting this question.	O doro anya na ọ nọ na-atụ anya ajụjụ a.
All my friends are here.	Ndị enyi m niile nọ ebe a.
Like this here.	Dị ka nke a ebe a.
One, he has only 20 friends.	Otu, o nwere naanị ndị enyi iri abụọ.
He actually said.	O kwuru n'ezie.
His clothes have no form.	Uwe ya enweghị ụdị.
Or maybe dead.	Ma ọ bụ ma eleghị anya nwụrụ anwụ.
Her face is beautiful.	Ihu ya mara mma mara mma.
Not of any kind.	Ọ bụghị ụdị ihe ọ bụla.
The crowds were terrified.	Ụjọ juru igwe mmadụ ahụ.
He will leave here.	Ọ ga-esi ebe a pụọ.
That is not a new idea.	Nke ahụ abụghị echiche ọhụrụ.
However, tell you something.	Otú ọ dị, gwa gị ihe.
His eyes see nothing.	Anya ya ahụghị ihe ọ bụla.
Often, the best stories are those with children.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, akụkọ kacha mma bụ ndị nwere ụmụaka.
You have time to be a doctor, know them.	Ị nwere oge iji bụrụ dọkịta, mara ha.
He called her.	Ọ kpọrọ ya.
It belongs to my brother.	Ọ bụ nke nwanne m nwoke.
He will not do anything.	Ọ gaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.
It's too extreme.	Ọ dị oke oke.
The city fell.	Obodo ahụ dara.
The game is now more than one in itself.	Egwuregwu dị ugbu a karịa otu n'onwe ya.
No one deserves it.	Ọ dịghị onye kwesịrị ya.
Language is a useful application, but it is only an application.	Asụsụ bụ ngwa bara uru, mana ọ bụ naanị ngwa.
He did not know his name, age, or any of the rest of our family.	Ọ maghị aha ya, afọ ndụ ya ma ọ bụ ezinụlọ anyị ndị ọzọ.
Three tracks going.	Egwu atọ na-aga.
You can not see what we saw.	Ị nweghị ike ịhụ ihe anyị hụrụ.
Or if you do.	Ma ọ bụ ọ bụrụ na ị na-eme.
That doesn't make sense.	Nke ahụ enweghị isi.
We found this room to be very beautiful.	Anyị hụrụ na ime ụlọ a mara mma nke ukwuu.
It’s a little weird along the way.	Ọ bụ ntakịrị ihe dị egwu n'ụzọ.
He should tell you a story.	O kwesịrị ịgwa gị otu akụkọ.
Great power.	Ike dị ukwuu.
But we eventually got it.	Ma anyị mechara nweta ya.
We are in it together now.	Anyị nọ na ya ọnụ ugbu a.
A police officer stopped a speeding car.	Onye uwe ojii kwụsịrị ụgbọ ala na-agba ọsọ.
Here comes.	Ebe a bịara.
I saw my father's hand in this.	Ahụrụ m aka nna m na nke a.
I just left it with him.	M nnọọ hapụrụ ya na ya.
You can, not them.	Ị nwere ike, ọ bụghị ha.
Three-wheeler.	Ụgbọ ala mmiri atọ.
She feels like a weird boy.	Ọ dị ya ka nwa nwoke dị egwu.
Obviously the city wants this.	O doro anya na obodo chọrọ nke a.
This is one.	Nke a bụ otu.
This is me!	Nke a bụ m!
We do it with our friends.	Anyị na ndị enyi anyị na-eme ya.
Maybe you can think of something ?.	Ma eleghị anya, ị nwere ike iche ihe?.
I wonder who they might be.	M na-eche ndị ha nwere ike ịbụ.
I do not know where we got that from.	Amaghị m ebe anyị si nweta nke ahụ.
The car stopped suddenly.	Igwe ụgbọ ala kwụsịrị na mberede.
But that is not for me.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị maka m.
Everyone is interested in this.	Onye ọ bụla nwere mmasị na nke a.
It does not taste good.	Ọ dịghị ụtọ.
And much to you.	Na ukwuu gị.
This has.	Nke a nwere.
It is the best.	Ọ kacha mma.
All of these things need enough water to survive.	Ihe ndị a niile chọrọ mmiri zuru oke iji dị ndụ.
This is my chance to make myself at home.	Nke a bụ ohere m ime onwe m n'ụlọ.
The good will continue.	Ihe ọma ahụ ga-aga n'ihu.
Beauty without it.	Mma na-enweghị ya.
It’s all sorts of things.	Ọ bụ ụdị ihe niile.
It is in front of me.	Ọ bụ n'ihu m.
I hope we have some similar interest.	Enwere m olileanya na anyị nwere mmasị ụfọdụ yiri nke ahụ.
This river has a time of drinking water.	Osimiri a nwere mgbe mmiri na-aṅụ mmanya.
That it was time.	Na ọ bụ oge.
It is the last thing you want.	Ọ bụ ihe ikpeazụ ị chọrọ.
I'm sorry about that, but there is a reason.	Ọ dị m nwute maka nke ahụ, mana enwere ihe kpatara ya.
Many of them looked at me intently.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha lere m anya nke ukwuu.
You read a lot of books.	Ị na-agụ ọtụtụ akwụkwọ.
This room has everything we need during our stay.	Ụlọ a nwere ihe niile dị anyị mkpa n'oge anyị nọ.
But you heard it here.	Ma ị nụrụ ya ebe a.
You can play.	Ị nwere ike igwu egwu.
I know it's hard, but it's something we have to do.	Ama m na o siri ike, mana ọ bụ ihe anyị ga-eme.
We got two more people there.	Anyị nwetara mmadụ abụọ ọzọ nọ ebe ahụ.
Sit on the ball.	Nọdụ ala na bọọlụ.
Some types of girl are unique.	Ụdị ụfọdụ nwa agbọghọ pụrụ iche.
He has no job for a year.	O nweghị ọrụ otu afọ.
The problem is how.	Nsogbu bụ otú.
Nothing happened to him.	Ọ dịghị ihe mere ya.
Not both of us.	Ọ bụghị anyị abụọ.
A new face is not good.	Ihu ọhụrụ adịghị mma.
It should be otherwise.	O kwesịrị ịbụ ma ọ bụghị.
That is the story in every community.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ n'ime obodo ọ bụla.
In the water, it is.	N'ime mmiri, ọ bụ.
I think it got worse at night.	Echere m na ọ ka njọ n'abalị.
The other is not necessary.	Nke ọzọ adịghị mkpa.
What to do?	Gịnị ka a ga-eme?
Not as we do, of course.	Ọ bụghị dị ka anyị na-eme, n'ezie.
I saw everything.	Ahụrụ m ihe niile.
Everyone will help us.	Onye ọ bụla ga-enyere anyị aka.
He did not do it just once.	Ọ bụghị otu ugboro ka ọ mere ndị dị iche iche ọtụtụ ugboro.
You are doing something wrong.	Ị na-eme ihe na-adịghị mma.
He fell head over heels.	Ọ dara n'isi.
If it works, fine.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ na-arụ ọrụ, ezigbo.
Giving authority is very powerful.	Inye ikike dị ike nke ukwuu.
It was a happy time.	Ọ bụ oge obi ụtọ.
The idea is that it can provide users with any type of body.	Echiche bụ na ọ nwere ike inye ndị ọrụ ụdị ahụ ọ bụla.
They came here to get a new and better job.	Ha bịara ebe a ka ha nweta ọrụ ọhụrụ na nke ka mma.
There will be something in the water.	Ga-abụ ihe dị na mmiri.
Help should be the same.	Enyemaka kwesịrị ịbụ otu.
This is the main difficulty of the study.	Nke a bụ isi ike nke ọmụmụ ihe.
I saw both big problems and small.	Ahụrụ ma nnukwu nsogbu ma obere.
He fell back abruptly.	Ọ dara azụ na mberede.
Now it comes from my right hand.	Ugbu a o si n'aka nri m bịa.
The boy would have died.	Nwa nwoke ahụ gaara anwụ.
Another place we know how to sit still.	Ebe ọzọ anyị ma ka esi anọ ọdụ chere.
But there are more difficult opportunities.	Ma e nwere ohere ndị ọzọ siri ike.
They do not know what it is.	Ha amaghị ihe ọ bụ.
Here, the case is very different.	N'ebe a, ikpe ahụ dị nnọọ iche.
Then he realized what had happened.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ ghọtara ihe merenụ.
It didn’t matter to me.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọ bụla nye m.
He looked back.	O lere ya anya azụ.
He knows where his hands should be.	Ọ maara ebe aka ya kwesịrị ịdị.
Some may not actually use it.	Ụfọdụ nwere ike ghara iji n'ezie mee ihe.
Move on!	Gaa ihu!
Then my moon suddenly stopped.	Mgbe ahụ, ọnwa m kwụsịrị na mberede.
Some of the leaders.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ndị isi.
But that is not all.	Ma na ihe niile abụghị ihe.
He promised to help me.	O kwere nkwa inye m aka.
You play as you do.	Ị na-egwu egwu ka ị na-eme.
We were kicked.	A gbara anyị ụkwụ.
He was running, playing.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ, na-egwu egwu.
But he can use the money to do it.	Ma o nwere ike iji ego ahụ mee ya.
The only reason he did it was to do it.	Naanị ihe o mere ka o ji mee ya.
But it does have a point.	Ma o nwere isi ihe.
There is a reason.	Enwere ihe kpatara ya.
Let us put you to sleep.	Ka anyị mee gị ụra.
Tell him whatever you think is best.	Gwa ya ihe ọ bụla i chere kacha mma.
This is no different.	Nke a adịghị iche.
She is pregnant.	Ọ tụrụ ime.
We thought it was a group of readers who would be interested.	Anyị chere na ọ bụ otu ndị na-agụ ga-enwe mmasị.
Stories need truth.	Akụkọ chọrọ eziokwu.
Of course, this would be logical.	N'ezie, nke a ga-abụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
The house is very nice.	Ụlọ ahụ dị ezigbo mma.
That person is a doctor.	Na onye ahụ bụ dọkịta.
However, that does not seem to be the case.	Otú ọ dị, o yighị ka ọ ga-adị mgbe ahụ.
There is no fear he can see.	Ọ dịghị egwu ọ pụrụ ịhụ.
Very, very bad.	Ezigbo, ezigbo njọ.
Obviously this would be true.	O doro anya na nke a ga-abụ eziokwu.
It was early in the morning so he didn't get upset.	Ọ bụ n'isi ụtụtụ ka ọ ghara iwe iwe.
In a dramatic way.	N'ụzọ dị egwu nke ike.
You will not be.	Ị gaghị anọ.
Stupid to do.	Ihe nzuzu ime.
We do not want more than that.	Anyị achọghị karịa nke ahụ.
This time should be good.	Oge a kwesịrị ịdị mma.
The doctor told the patient to rest.	Dọkịta ahụ gwara onye ọrịa ka ọ zuru ike.
No harm was done.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọjọọ e mere.
I am very prepared.	Adị m njikere nke ukwuu.
I had a car accident.	Enwere m ihe mberede ụgbọ ala.
Not for a minute.	Ọ bụghị maka otu nkeji.
I was very angry.	Iwe were m nke ukwuu.
Goodness reads in court.	Ịdị mma na-agụ n'ụlọ ikpe.
Not where you think.	Ọ bụghị ebe ị na-eche.
Thank you very much.	Daalụ nke ukwuu.
This message has no effect.	Ozi a enweghị mmetụta.
Not that he does a lot of different things.	Ọ bụghị na ọ na-eme ọtụtụ ihe dị iche.
They work from flashbacks to self-portraits.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ site na akwụkwọ ọkụ na foto nke onwe ha.
Playing soccer.	Ịgba egwuregwu bọọlụ.
He is someone else.	Ọ bụ onye ọzọ.
It doesn't work on the road.	Ọ naghị arụ ọrụ n'ụzọ.
He did it, you know.	O mere ya, ị mara.
Tell yourself you don't want the food.	Gwa onwe gị na ị chọghị nri ahụ.
This is no small matter.	Nke a abụghị obere okwu.
They do not care.	Ha achọghị ịma.
For the first time in his life, he was unique.	Na nke mbụ ná ndụ ya, ọ pụrụ iche.
But his eyes are awesome.	Ma anya ya dị egwu.
The man was like a machine.	Nwoke ahụ dị ka igwe.
It does not wait long.	Ọ naghị echere ogologo oge.
It is possible.	O kwere omume.
She likes to play there as a girl.	Ọ na-enwe mmasị igwu egwu ala ebe ahụ dị ka nwa agbọghọ.
No shoes, no shirts.	Enweghị akpụkpọ ụkwụ, enweghị uwe elu.
Worth the money.	Kwesịrị ego ahụ.
She obviously thinks that is a good thing.	O doro ya anya na ọ na-eche ya na nke ahụ dị mma.
He told her he was succeeding.	Ọ gwara ya na ọ na-aga nke ọma.
That was his old life.	Nke ahụ bụ ndụ ochie ya.
We are still good friends.	Anyị ka bụ ezigbo enyi.
He gained confidence.	O nwetara obi ike.
I can't do it.	Enweghị m ike ime ya.
But no, it will not.	Ma mba, ọ gaghị adị.
That is not good for me.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma site m.
This night was fun, though.	Abalị a na-atọ ụtọ, n'agbanyeghị.
My friends are good.	Ndị enyi m dị mma.
They really deserve it.	Ha kwesịrị ya n'ezie.
It has just started.	A malitere ya ugbu a.
It is only natural that he should have doubts.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ihe dị otú o kwesịrị na ọ na-enwe obi abụọ.
We had a hearty meal at a restaurant.	Anyị riri nri dị ụtọ n'otu ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
She needs new clothes.	Ọ chọrọ uwe ọhụrụ.
You mentioned my name.	I kwuru aha m.
Take yourself, he said.	Were onwe gị, o kwuru.
It's inside.	Ọ dị n'ime.
And he proceeded to go and go.	O wee mee, ọ gara.
At that time there was nowhere to go.	N'oge ahụ enweghị ebe ị ga-aga.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
It is hard to see it in the first picture.	O siri ike ịhụ ya na foto mbụ.
Just kidding.	Na-egwu egwu.
He did not know.	Ọ maghị.
No, wait.	Mba, chere.
About why.	Banyere ihe kpatara ya.
Everyone will do the same.	Onye ọ bụla ga-eme n'otu ọnọdụ ahụ.
It is a legal duty.	Ọ bụ ọrụ iwu.
That is one fundamental truth.	Nke ahụ bụ otu isi eziokwu.
I am happy with it.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ya.
We need to find a place for everyone.	Anyị kwesịrị ịchọta ebe onye ọ bụla ga-anọ.
We are invaluable for that.	Anyị bara oke uru maka nke ahụ.
Thinking about what is good.	Iche echiche banyere ihe dị mma.
But that, my friends, it is.	Ma nke ahụ, ndị enyi m, ọ bụ ya.
The future seems to be my first task.	Ihe dị n'ihu yiri ka ọ bụ ọrụ mbụ m.
I think there are still very few survivors.	Echere m na a ka nwere ndị dị ndụ ole na ole.
So he has a lot of money in hand.	N'ihi ya, o nwere nnukwu ego n'aka.
I'm not good at it, but it's four things.	Adịghị m mma, mana ọ bụ ihe anọ.
That is why.	Ọ bụ ya kpatara ya.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
Truth is false.	Eziokwu dị na ụgha.
It is better than that.	Ọ dị mma karịa otú ahụ.
Last year was cold.	Afọ gara aga bụ oyi.
That is what we are talking about.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị na-ekwu.
I am a fish in the water.	Abụ m azụ̀ dị na mmiri.
This is a beautiful dress.	Nke a bụ uwe mara mma.
But more than that, we should not go.	Ma karịa nke a, anyị ekwesịghị ịga.
Thanks for the pre-order.	Daalụ maka tupu ụzọ.
I walked in to his side.	M banyere n'akụkụ ya.
That does not seem to be the case.	O yighị ka nke ahụ ga-eme.
No, it is for you.	Mba, ọ bụ maka gị.
But that is not true.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
They did the same.	Ha mere otu ihe ahụ.
They took the matter seriously.	Ha ji okwu ahụ kpọrọ ihe.
I do not want anyone here in danger because of it.	Achọghị m onye ọ bụla nọ ebe a n'ihe egwu n'ihi ya.
Doing a lot of great work in one difficult time.	Ime ọtụtụ nnukwu ọrụ n'otu oge siri ike.
Your birth will not.	Ọmụmụ gị agaghị.
Unfortunately it is still in my womb.	Ọ dị nwute na ọ ka nọ n'afọ m.
He liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya.
I myself do not want that to happen.	Achọghị m n'onwe m ka nke ahụ mee.
He loves you, you know.	Ọ hụrụ gị n'anya, ị maara.
The issue continues.	Okwu a na-aga n'ihu.
A good night's rest is what you want.	Ezigbo ezumike abalị bụ ihe ịchọrọ.
But well, you know.	Ma ọ dị mma, ị maara.
I never thought he loved me so much.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chere na ọ hụrụ m n'anya nke ukwuu.
Obviously not.	O doro anya na nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
You like to plan.	Ọ na-amasị gị ime atụmatụ.
The main difference is time.	Isi ihe dị iche bụ oge.
Clothes and legs are eaten.	A na-eri akwa na ụkwụ.
This is something new.	Nke a bụ ihe ọhụrụ.
I love you, girl.	Ahụrụ gị n'anya, nwa agbọghọ.
Get emotional about it.	Nweta mmetụta maka ya.
He is my older brother.	Ọ bụ nnukwu nwanne m nwoke.
The building is on the upper side.	Ụlọ ahụ dị n'akụkụ elu.
He looked into it.	O lere anya n'ime ya.
It would not have been better.	Agaraghị aka mma.
We know it's special.	Anyị maara na ọ pụrụ iche.
We do not know you.	Anyị amaghị gị.
This can be done very well.	Enwere ike ime nke a nke ọma.

I'm sure you know these things.	Eji m n’aka na ị ma ihe ndị a.

The song of the month is very beautiful.	Abụ nke ọnwa ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
Let it be known that you are a person.	Ka ị mara na ị bụ onye.
They will not go.	Ha agaghị aga.
He said the city needs good travel.	O kwuru na obodo a chọrọ njem nke ọma.
He was given a drug.	E        nye a ọgwụ ike.
This will make your legs longer.	Nke a ga-eme ka ụkwụ gị dị ogologo.
This fish is delicious.	Azụ a na-atọ ụtọ.
I have no time for myself.	Enweghị m oge maka onwe m.
He seems to like it.	O yiri ka ọ masịrị ya.
I have many books.	Enwere m ọtụtụ akwụkwọ.
But that is a good idea.	Mana nke ahụ bụ ezi echiche.
Some are green.	Ụfọdụ bụ akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ.
How green of them.	Olee otú akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ nke ha.
We know what they did.	Anyị maara ihe ha mere.
I do not want to leave.	Achọghị m ịpụ.

Another wants to get out before the next station.	Onye ọzọ chọrọ ịpụ tupu ọdụ ụgbọ ọzọ.
We arrived at our destination.	Anyị rutere ebe anyị na-aga.
We thought it was beautiful.	Anyị chere na ọ mara mma.
You have to go to school every day.	Ị ga-aga akwụkwọ kwa ụbọchị.
He will be ready to go.	Ọ ga-adị njikere ịga.
There is not much more to go.	Ọ dịghị ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ ịga.
No.	Ọ dịghị.
This building has a great history.	Ụlọ a nwere nnukwu akụkọ ihe mere eme.
I're sorry to say that, but it's true.	Ọ dị m nwute ikwu nke ahụ, mana ọ bụ eziokwu.
Make it a river.	Mee ka ọ bụ osimiri.
I am a boss.	Abụ m onye isi.
We are husband and wife.	Anyị bụ nwoke na nwunye.
But that’s not the reason for the planners.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị ihe kpatara ndị na-eme atụmatụ.
Inside the bag there is something different.	N'ime akpa ahụ nwere ihe dị iche.
But this is not the day.	Ma nke a abụghị ụbọchị ahụ.
He thinks about it.	Ọ na-eche banyere ya.
Only them or me.	Ọ bụ naanị ha ma ọ bụ mụ onwe m.
In life, of course.	Na ndụ, n'ezie.
I want to hate this man.	Achọrọ m ịkpọ nwoke a asị.

Because it's good for kids to see that.	Maka na ọ dị mma ka ụmụaka hụ nke ahụ.
The city needs a better way.	Obodo chọrọ ụzọ ka mma.
It is fun to go to the beach.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ ịga osimiri.
Everything should be perfect.	Ihe niile kwesịrị izu oke.

You are a good person.	Ị bụ ezigbo mmadụ.

That’s pretty much how you got me this way.	Nke ahụ mara mma ka ị nwetara m otu a.
You will do well in time and practice !!!.	Ị ga-eme nke ọma na oge na omume !!!.
Stupid as a fool does.	Onye nzuzu dị ka onye nzuzu na-eme.
Many people visit the city every day.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-aga obodo ahụ kwa ụbọchị.
You will not feel well.	Ọ gaghị adị gị mma.
I told the car company what had happened.	Agwara m ụlọ ọrụ ụgbọ ala ihe ahụ merenụ.
In a small room.	N'ime obere ụlọ.
There is nothing special here.	Ọ nweghị ihe pụrụ iche ebe a.
Nothing made her feel so good.	O nweghị ihe mere ka obi dị ya mma otú ahụ.
We found them at a bar together.	Anyị hụrụ ha n'otu ụlọ mmanya ọnụ.
This house gave me life.	Ụlọ a nyere m ndụ.
Suppose we have that.	Were ya na anyị nwere na nke ahụ.
It does not taste good.	Ọ naghị atọ ụtọ.
He looked into the cold water.	O lere anya n'ime mmiri jụrụ oyi.
I want to be in you.	Achọrọ m ịnọ n'ime gị.
But he wanted nothing.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ chọrọ.
This is high time.	Nke a bụ oge dị elu.
It has the power to be.	O nwere ikike ịbụ.
A child cannot speak now.	Nwata enweghị ike ikwu okwu ugbu a.
Nothing can come out of that case.	Ọ nweghị ihe nwere ike ịpụ na ikpe ahụ.
Do you know where the moon goes at night?	Ị ma ebe ọnwa na-aga n'abalị?
Because their employees are new.	N'ihi na ndị ọrụ ha dị ọhụrụ.
He looked at me intently.	O lere m anya nke ọma.
They went on.	Ha gara n'ihu.
Ideas come quickly.	Echiche na-abịa ngwa ngwa.
Their language is strong.	Asụsụ ha na-asụ siri ike.
This in itself is a very important financial question.	Ihe a n'onwe ya bụ ajụjụ dị oke mkpa ego.
It was considered impossible.	E chere na ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
He certainly loved the work.	O doro anya na ọ hụrụ ọrụ ahụ n'anya.
Not only will it not happen.	Ọ bụghị naanị na ọ gaghị eme.
In another chapter.	Na isi ọzọ.
The doctor's house.	Ụlọ nke dọkịta.
And by the way nothing new here.	Na n'ụzọ ọ dịghị ihe ọhụrụ ebe a.
This may be a week or two.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ otu izu ma ọ bụ abụọ.
But they are ready to go.	Ma ha dị njikere ịga.
I will do the same.	M ga-eme otu.
I saw the movie.	Ahụrụ m ihe nkiri ahụ.
Let me know when you know me.	Mee ka m mara mgbe ị maara m.
With my husband.	Mụ na di m.
I felt like I was alone with my brother.	Ọ dị m ka ọ bụ naanị mụ na nwanne m nwoke.
You get coffee.	Ị nweta kọfị.
There are two other important factors.	E nwere ihe abụọ ọzọ dị mkpa.
I like to know.	Ọ na-amasị m ịma.
There is something horrible tonight.	Enwere ihe egwu n'abalị a.
Good for both of them.	Ọ dị mma maka ha abụọ.
If not now, when ?.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị ugbu a, olee mgbe?.
It's serious, but it's difficult.	Ọ dị oke njọ, mana ọ siri ike.
Then the third and fourth.	Mgbe ahụ nke atọ na nke anọ.
This is just one.	Nke a bụ naanị otu.
Maybe better than knowing yourself.	Ma eleghị anya, ka mma karịa ka ị maara onwe gị.
He was facing problems.	Ọ nọ na-eche nsogbu ihu.
I really want to.	Achọrọ m n'ezie.
We want more than that.	Anyị chọrọ karịa nke ahụ.
It obviously had no effect.	O doro anya na ọ nweghị mmetụta.
That is today.	Nke ọ bụ taa.
Today is the first day of my life.	Taa bụ ụbọchị mbụ nke ndụ m niile.
But another piece of cloth.	Ma ibe akwa ọzọ.
He needed strength.	Ike dị ya mkpa.
But of course, it still exists.	Ma n'ezie, ọ ka dị.
It's bad.	Ọ dị njọ.
It frightened us.	Ọ tụrụ anyị egwu.
As a special case.	Dị ka ikpe pụrụ iche.
I like this place.	Ebe a masịrị m.
Here she is alone with her son.	Ebe a bụ naanị ya na nwa ya nwoke.
It's not bad.	Ọ naghị adị njọ.
What is this city like?	Kedu ka obodo a dị?
The worst would be when he came.	Ihe kacha njọ ga-abụ ma ọ bịa.
It was the last game of the season.	Ọ bụ egwuregwu ikpeazụ nke oge.
This will be your age.	Nke a ga-abụ afọ gị.
It was the ultimate happiness.	Ọ bụ obi ụtọ ikpeazụ.
The house is where I did things.	Ụlọ bụ ebe m mere ihe.
He bought a microphone and a microphone.	Ọ zụtara igwe okwu na igwe okwu.
He will be there.	Ọ ga-anọ ebe ahụ.
It's easy.	Ọ dị mfe.
Really scary.	Ezigbo egwu n'ezie.
No one told him anything.	Ọ dịghị onye gwara ya ihe ọ bụla.
Talking on the phone is not very good.	Ikwu okwu na ekwentị adịghị mma nke ukwuu.
I do not go.	Anaghị m aga.
I'm fine.	Adị m mma.
But then we did.	Ma mgbe ahụ, anyị mere ya.
And this is one of them.	Na nke a bụ otu n'ime ha.
The point is important.	Isi ihe o kwuru bụ ihe dị mkpa.
He is your first person.	Ọ bụ ya bụ onye mbụ gị.
They looked at me once and realized there was something up there.	Ha lere m anya otu ugboro wee mara na ọ dị ihe dị elu.
Just another boat there.	Naanị otu ụgbọ mmiri ọzọ ebe ahụ.
To my surprise, not many of them went to court.	O juru m anya na ọ bụghị ọtụtụ n'ime ha na-aga ikpe.
One of the towers collapsed.	Otu n'ime ụlọ elu ahụ dara.
No work.	Enweghị ọrụ ọ bụla.
I have the opportunity to go to my destination.	Enwere m ohere ịga na ebe m ga-anọ.
They can move on.	Ha nwere ike ịga n'ihu.
This does not taste very good.	Nke a anaghị atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
I asked him.	M jụrụ ya.
Do your worst.	Mee ihe kacha njọ gị.
Your words are awesome.	Okwu gị dị egwu.
He is very happy.	Obi dị ya mma nke ukwuu.
So do what you want as soon as you need it.	Ya mere, mee ihe ị chọrọ ozugbo ị chọrọ ya.
They set us on fire.	Ha na-agba anyị ọkụ.
Your mind works in different ways.	Uche gị na-arụ ọrụ n'ụzọ dị iche iche.
You know where everything is.	Ị maara ebe ihe niile dị.
Find a crowded room.	Chọọ n'ọnụ ụlọ mmadụ juru.
That is just so.	Nke ahụ dị nnọọ otú ahụ.
They look good.	Ha dị ka ọ dị mma.
I think he understood the story.	Ọ dị m ka ọ ghọtara akụkọ ahụ.
We were there about once.	Anyị nọ ebe ahụ ihe dị ka otu mgbe.
Your time is coming.	Oge gị na-abịa.
The thought stopped it.	Echiche ahụ kwụsịrị ya.
I had a fantastic summer.	Enwere m oge okpomọkụ dị egwu.
I plan to eat as healthy as possible.	M na-eme atụmatụ iri ahụ ike dị ka o kwere mee.
However, parental difficulties should not be too great.	Otú ọ dị, ihe isi ike ndị nne na nna ekwesịghị ịdị ukwuu.
Impossible.	Ihe agaghị ekwe omume.
We had a great week.	Anyị nwere ezigbo izu nke ọma.
I know that for a fact.	Amaara m nke ahụ n'ezie.
I think it’s all for the moment.	Echere m na ọ bụ ihe niile maka oge a.
I go to the message, but as soon as the message is complete.	M na-aga ozi, ma ozugbo ozi ahụ zuru.
No, not this room.	Mba, ọ bụghị ime ụlọ a.
It would have been his job.	Ọ gaara abụ ọrụ ya.
The reason is the same.	Ihe kpatara eme bụ otu ihe ahụ.
I'm really sorry.	Ọ dị m nwute n'ezie.
Everything will be his way.	Ihe niile ga-abụ ụzọ ya.
That is what makes this different.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe na-eme ka nke a dị iche.
This is not possible.	Nke a agaghị ekwe omume.
Everyone there knows him.	Ndị niile nọ ebe ahụ ma ya.
There is nothing else in it.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ na ya.
I am not a machine.	Abụghị m igwe.
The music got me the best.	Egwu nwetara m kacha mma.
We can do the best or the worst.	Anyị nwere ike ime ihe kacha mma ma ọ bụ nke kacha njọ.
I am a good friend.	Abụ m ezigbo enyi.
No name, because no name is required.	O nweghị aha, n’ihi na a chọghị aha.
Wait for him to do the same.	Chere ka ọ na-eme otu ihe ahụ.
Everything stopped suddenly for him.	Ihe niile kwụsịrị na mberede n'ebe ọ nọ.
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
At the time, it seemed like a big deal.	N'oge ahụ, ọ dị ka nnukwu ihe.
My mind is far away.	Uche m dị anya.
I am healthy.	Ahụ adị m mma.
Somehow he knew.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ ọ maara.
Beautiful student, swimmer, dancer.	Nwa akwụkwọ mara mma, onye na-egwu mmiri, onye ịgba egwu.
Good on it.	Ọ dị mma na ya.
Doing so is hard work.	Ime ya bụ ọrụ siri ike.
He did not have to wait long.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ka ọ na-eche ogologo oge.
The human body.	Ahụ mmadụ.
It is very powerful.	Ọ dị nnọọ ike.
The water flows through the river.	Mmiri na-aga site na mmiri mmiri.
But you heard what he said.	Ma ị nụrụ ihe o kwuru.
Just like the rest of this country, he said.	Dị nnọọ ka ndị ọzọ nke mba a, o kwuru.
Maybe it is now.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ugbu a.
But you can not do anything about it.	Ma ị nweghị ike ime ihe ọ bụla na nke a.
They do not have any kind of money.	Ha anaghị enwe ụdị ego ọ bụla.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Enweghị ihe ị ga-eme n'ebe ahụ.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
Tell them what happened.	Gwa ha ihe merenụ.
Every feeling has a cause, and every cause.	Mmetụta ọ bụla nwere ihe kpatara ya, na ihe ọ bụla kpatara ya.
I could live without it.	Enwere m ike ịdị ndụ na-enweghị nke ahụ.
Today, he left me.	Taa, ọ hapụrụ m.
They do not go.	Ha anaghị aga.
They make sense.	Ha na-enwe uche.
I think it’s good for everyone.	Echere m na ọ dị mma maka onye ọ bụla.
That is a big problem.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
Do what you want.	Ime ihe ị chọrọ.
I can believe it.	Enwere m ike ikweta ya.
What a great company.	Kedu nnukwu ụlọ ọrụ.
Finding the weaknesses of others.	Ịchọta adịghị ike nke ndị ọzọ.
Perfection in the head.	Izu oke n'isi.
Would not have gone there.	Agaraghị ebe ahụ.
That is where we are now.	Ọ bụ ebe ahụ ka anyị nọ ugbu a.
We had a long trip ahead in the winter.	Anyị nwere ogologo njem n'ihu na oyi.
My sister is having a big party.	Nwanne m nwanyị na-enwe nnukwu oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
He said they knew each other very well.	O kwuru na ha maara nke ọma.
This is a hateful city.	Nke a bụ obodo kpọrọ asị.
Continue immediately to the great bridge of history.	Gaa n'ihu ozugbo na akwa mmiri akụkọ ihe mere eme.
Absolutely.	Zuru oke.
We may not have this opportunity again.	Anyị nwere ike ghara inwe ohere a ọzọ.
Not trying to be.	Ọ bụghị na-agbalị ịbụ.
It's not perfect.	Ọ bụghị ihe zuru oke.
And not just in it.	Ọ bụghị naanị n'ime ya.
You did well.	Ị mere nke ọma.
But man will not.	Ma mmadụ agaghị.
It is stubborn.	O kwere isi ike.
Do whatever you have to do.	Mee ihe ọ bụla ị ga-eme.
They may not know what they know.	O nwere ike ha agaghị ama ihe ha maara.
He took a long drink.	O were ogologo ihe ọṅụṅụ mmanya.
I always felt guilty for that.	Obi na-ama m ikpe mgbe niile maka nke ahụ.
The market is vast.	Ngwa ahịa ahụ karịrị nke ukwuu.
That probably happens more than people realize.	Nke ahụ na-eme eleghị anya karịa ka ndị mmadụ maara.
There is only one bad thing in it.	Enwere naanị otu ihe ọjọọ na ya.
I was able to run it in a few minutes.	Enwere m ike ịgba ọsọ ahụ n'ime obere nkeji.
Shoot for me.	Ịgba maka m.
Ask him to sit next to you.	Gwa ya ka ọ nọrọ n'akụkụ ya.
I applied.	M tinyere akwụkwọ.
You run well.	Ị na-agba ọsọ nke ọma.
She enjoys cooking.	Isi nri na-atọ ya ụtọ.
I think this is a huge lack.	Echere m na nke a bụ nnukwu enweghị.
Without too much time.	Na-enweghị oke oge.
That is up to you.	Nke ahụ dị gị n'aka.
That is what the group does.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe otu ahụ na-eme.
The two are really the same.	Ihe abụọ ahụ bụ n'ezie otu.
They are very important to them.	Ọ dị ha ezigbo mkpa.
The only thing we get now is a name.	Naanị ihe anyị nwetara ugbu a bụ aha.
You are right, we are happy, for some time we are here.	Ị kwuru eziokwu na anyị nwere obi ụtọ, ruo oge ụfọdụ anyị nọ.
I would like it.	M ga-achọ ya.
A courthouse surrounded the courthouse.	Otu ụlọ mkpọrọ gbara ụlọ ikpe ahụ gburugburu.
It seems like it's too early to go there.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị ngwa ịga naanị ebe ahụ.
I am busy.	Enwere m ọrụ n'aka.
My real name.	Ezi aha m.
The cars are moving so fast, you can see them moving.	Ụgbọ ala ndị ahụ na-agba ọsọ nke ukwuu, ị nwere ike ịhụ ka ha na-aga.
Pretty much really.	Mara mma nke ukwuu n'ezie.
I'm sorry, everyone, he thought.	Ọ dị m nwute, onye ọ bụla, o chere.
The passengers looked at him.	Ndị njem ahụ lere ya anya.
Still, it is easy to see how small it is.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ dị mfe ịhụ otú ọ ka dị obere.
I'm afraid people here will not enjoy it anytime soon.	Ana m atụ egwu ndị mmadụ ebe a agaghị enwe mmasị na ya n'oge adịghị anya.
He is eating at it.	Ọ na-eri nri na ya.
This task is completely simple.	Ọrụ a dị mfe zuru oke.
Although it may be good.	N'agbanyeghị na o nwere ike ịbụ nke ọma.
It's hard and perfect again.	O siri ike wee zuru oke ọzọ.
All of this can be seen very clearly.	Enwere ike ịhụ ihe ndị a niile na nke ọma.
Of course they can not.	N'ezie ha enweghị ike.
The three of us looked at it.	Anyị atọ lere ya anya.
I am glad that they had time to help me.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ha nwere oge iji nyere m aka.
This city is the capital of the city.	Obodo a bụ isi obodo obodo ahụ.
That it makes me a bad person.	Na ọ na-eme ka m bụrụ onye ọjọọ.
But they can not.	Ma ha enweghị ike.
You think they want it.	Ị chere na ha chọrọ ya.
The body can be anyone's.	Ahụ nwere ike ịbụ nke onye ọ bụla.
It's in the news.	Ọ bụ na akụkọ.
Children are not good.	Ụmụaka adịghị mma.
Each book is different.	Akwụkwọ ọ bụla dị iche.
It's too scary.	Ọ dị oke egwu.
And he did not speak.	O wee ghara ikwu okwu.
I need it.	Ọ dị m mkpa.
Those are just jobs.	Ndị ahụ bụ naanị ọrụ.
It is not.	Ọ bụghị ya.
He promised to sing the song that night.	O kwere nkwa na ya ga-abụ abụ abalị ahụ.
This trip was a huge success.	Njem a bụ nnukwu ihe ịga nke ọma.
I would not do that.	Agaghị m eme ya otú ahụ.
Not everyone has the mental capacity.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla nwere ike nke uche.
But something was wrong.	Ma ọ dị ihe dị nnọọ njọ.
They stayed in a small restaurant.	Ha nọrọ na obere ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.
Glad I got it.	Obi dị m ụtọ na m nwetara ya.
The lesson was a success.	Ihe nkuzi gara nke ọma.
It should not be difficult.	O kwesịghị isi ike.
Great, of course.	Ihe dị ukwuu, n'ezie.
He has many friends.	O nwere ọtụtụ ndị enyi.
Then they started to do violence.	Mgbe ahụ, ha malitere ime ihe ike.
It helped to have that awesome experience.	O nyere aka n'ebe ihe ahụ dị egwu dị.
It’s just that it doesn’t speed up.	Ọ bụ naanị ya na-adịghị eme ngwa ngwa.
They are not as good at their work as anyone else.	Ha adịghị mma n'ọrụ ha dị ka onye ọzọ.
I am glad that he did.	Obi dị m ụtọ na o mechara bụrụ onye a tụrụ anya ya.
He said.	O si na .
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
He is more busy.	O ji ọrụ n'aka karịa.
It looks like it's coming from within.	Ọ dị ka o si n'ime.
He did not know why.	Ọ maghị ihe kpatara ya.
And energy is cheap, and that's it.	Na ike dị ọnụ ala, na nke ahụ.
I'm glad I have you.	Obi dị m ụtọ na m nwere gị.
I saw my father and myself very well.	Ahụrụ m nna m na onwe m nke ọma.

He looked at me intently and kept his distance.	O lere m anya nke ọma wee mee ka ọ dị anya.
Or any question of authority.	Ma ọ bụ ajụjụ ọ bụla nke ikike.
That would be a lie.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ụgha.
The most important thing is to go somewhere.	Ihe niile dị ezigbo mkpa bụ ịga ebe.
Well, of course.	Ọ dị mma, n'ezie.
A nice house, with ten rooms.	Ụlọ dị mma, nke nwere ọnụ ụlọ iri.
Not a good thing.	Ọ bụghị ihe dị mma.
They are doing well here.	Ha na-eme nke ọma ebe a.
The price is good.	Ụgwọ ahụ dị mma.
Love me, love me, love me.	Hụ m n'anya, hụ m n'anya, hụ m n'anya.
This cannot really be done.	Enweghị ike ime nke a n'ezie.
It is difficult to see it in crowds.	O siri ike ịhụ ya n'ime igwe mmadụ.
You want a good vacation.	Ị chọrọ ezigbo ezumike.
Think immediately of who they are doing it to.	Na-eche ozugbo onye ha na-eme ya.
Do this as much as you can.	Mee nke a ka i nwere ike.
It does not happen often.	Ọ naghị eme ọtụtụ mgbe.
He looked at the message again.	Ọ lere ozi ahụ ọzọ.
I feel like that is good.	Adị m ka nke ahụ dị mma.
It acts like an immortal.	Ọ na-eme dị ka anwụ anwụ.
The drug works, but it has side effects.	Ọgwụ ahụ na-arụ ọrụ, ma ọ nwere mmetụta dị njọ.
Going solid and fast as possible.	Na-aga siri ike na ngwa ngwa o kwere mee.
I'm sorry for that.	Ọ dị m nwute maka nke ahụ.
These have obvious benefits.	Ndị a nwere uru doro anya.
What a negative type.	Kedu ụdị na-adịghị mma.
Every family wants that.	Ezinụlọ ọ bụla chọrọ nke ahụ.
These are my promises.	Ndị a bụ nkwa m.
So come ready.	Ya mere, bịa na njikere.
No one entered.	Ọ dịghị onye banyere.
But he wants you.	Ma ọ chọrọ gị.
That is your job.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ gị.
This is what low energy is.	Nke a bụ ihe na-eme ike ala.
There is no point in rushing.	O nweghị uru ime ọsọ ọsọ.
Because this story is only for you.	N'ihi na akụkọ a bụ naanị gị.
This is the second such incident in two months.	Ọ bụ nke abụọ ụdị ihe a mere n'ime ọnwa abụọ.
They can't find one. 	Ha apụghị ịchọta otu. 
She speaks many languages.	Ọ na-asụ ọtụtụ asụsụ nke ọma.
You know, how do you feel about that.	Ị mara, kedu ka ọ dị gị maka nke ahụ.
It's impossible.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
The reason is twofold.	Ihe kpatara ya bụ abụọ na isi.
No one likes to be told to enjoy the game.	Ọ dịghị onye na-enwe mmasị ka a gwa ya ka ọ na-atọ ụtọ egwuregwu.
He died when he was a child.	Ọ nwụrụ mgbe ọ bụ nwata.
Making great music.	Ime nnukwu egwu.
But the whole story could not be.	Mana akụkọ ahụ niile enweghị ike ịbụ.
You just say it is.	Naanị ị na-ekwu na ọ bụ.
Kind of a game.	Ụdị egwuregwu.
It can be really scary.	O nwere ike ịdị egwu n'ezie.
There are many of them.	E nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
Which does a lot of things.	Nke na-eme ọtụtụ ihe.
It's too bad.	Ọ dị njọ nke ukwuu.
Don't think about it anymore.	Echeghị ya ọzọ.
It is a unique city.	Ọ bụ obodo pụrụ iche.
However, he will not use them.	Otú ọ dị, ọ gaghị eji ha eme ihe.
It's good to be good.	Ọ dị mma ịdị mma.
Sit back and relax.	Nọdụ ala ma zuru ike.
You have stubbornness.	Ị nwere isi ike.
We do what we get.	Anyị na-eme ihe anyị nwetara.
However, this is far from the case.	Otú ọ dị, nke a dị anya site na ikpe ahụ.
It has a point for truth.	O nwere isi maka eziokwu.
This can provide something interesting.	Nke a nwere ike inye ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
I want you to receive this special gift.	Achọrọ m ka ị nweta onyinye a pụrụ iche.
I can not see anything.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla.
If it is a machine.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ igwe .
Made a lot of money.	Mere nnukwu ego.
In hunger.	Na agụụ.
I wonder what you think about it.	M na-eche ihe ị na-eche banyere ya.

The car sped off the road.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ na-agba ọsọ si n'ụzọ pụọ.
I'm happy.	Obi dị m ụtọ.
Not too fast, but not too fast.	Ọ bụghị oke ngwa ngwa, mana ọ bụghị ngwa ngwa.
We took it.	Anyị were ya.
We have a good country to be you.	Anyị nwere ezigbo mba ịbụ gị.
It's easy to do.	Ọ dị mfe ime.
It may take a while.	Ọ nwere ike were ntakịrị oge.
From there, they could not see a thing.	Site n'ebe ahụ, ha enweghị ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla.
His students love him.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ya hụrụ ya n'anya.
We did not.	Anyị emeghị otú ahụ.
He began to think through emotions.	Ọ malitere iche echiche site na mmetụta.
It may be hopeless.	O nwere ike ịbụ enweghị olileanya.
I do not know.	Amaghị.
Your benefits will be the same.	Uru gị ga-adị otu.
It is useless.	O nweghị uru ọ bara.
I like the people.	Ndị ahụ masịrị m.
It's just like the old days.	Ọ dị nnọọ ka oge ochie.
Nothing happened.	Ọ nweghị ihe mere.
But people miss him.	Ma ụmụ mmadụ na-atụ uche ya.
His energy is going fast.	Ike ya na-aga ngwa ngwa.
Anything can happen.	Ihe niile nwere ike ime.
However, this is not true.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị eziokwu.
It will be a very important point in this book.	Ọ ga-abụ isi ihe dị oke mkpa na akwụkwọ a.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!	Daalụ daalụ daalụ!.
I feel sleep deprived.	Ana m enwe mmetụta enweghị ụra.

We need all the help we can get.	Anyị chọrọ enyemaka niile anyị nwere ike nweta.
That's it.	Ọ bụ ya.

All that matters is here and now.	Ihe niile dị mkpa bụ ebe a na ugbu a.
The boss said everything was fine.	Onye isi ahụ kwuru na ihe niile dị mma.

I like them for breakfast.	Enwere m mmasị na ha maka nri ụtụtụ.
Good condition is important even though it is not necessary.	Ọnọdụ dị mma dị mkpa n'agbanyeghị na ọ dịghị mkpa.
The locals are not interested in the locals.	Ndị obodo ahụ enweghị mmasị na ndị obodo.
I know you will want me.	Ama m na ị ga-achọ m.
This is where we are going.	Nke a bụ ebe anyị na-aga.
She said it was good and her beauty.	O kwuru na ọ dị mma na ịma mma ya.
The name speaks for itself.	Aha a na-ekwu naanị ya.
It’s beautiful, no doubt about it.	Ọ mara mma, obi abụọ adịghị ya na nke ahụ.
It makes it smaller.	Ọ na-eme ka ọ dị obere.
See where they are running and where they are going.	Hụ ebe ha na-agba ọsọ na ebe ha na-aga.
But suddenly, it was clear.	Ma na mberede, o doro ya anya.
I have a great time.	Enwere m nnukwu oge.
One moment, please!	Otu oge, biko!
Things are not bad there.	Ihe adịghị njọ ebe ahụ.
However, that is not the reason.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị ya kpatara ya.
I have work ahead of me.	Enwere m ọrụ n'ihu m.
In the worst way.	N'ụzọ kacha njọ.
We can burn.	Anyị nwere ike ọkụ.

You can use any.	Ị nwere ike iji nke ọ bụla.
The girl was right.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ kwuru eziokwu.

He ran the ball.	Ọ gbara ọsọ bọọlụ.

I wonder how many people live.	M na-eche mmadụ ole dị ndụ.
The woman is very beautiful.	Nwanyị ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
This city needs good transportation.	Obodo a chọrọ ụgbọ njem nke ọma.
It is a very different situation.	Ọ bụ ọnọdụ dị nnọọ iche.
He asked her if it was the father.	Ọ jụrụ ya ma ọ̀ bụ nna ahụ.

The important thing is that they did.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ na ha mere.
He was the last person to see his mother.	Ọ bụ ya bụ onye ikpeazụ hụrụ nne ya.

We will not have the time as we expected.	Anyị agaghị enwe oge dị ka anyị tụrụ anya ya.
A service can be a customer of another service.	Ọrụ nwere ike ịbụ onye ahịa nke ọrụ ọzọ.

I try to imagine what it would be like.	M na-agbalị iche ihe ọ ga-achọ.
As a result, they are not seeing what they really are.	N’ihi ya, ha ahụghị otú ha dị n’ezie.
We are still children.	Anyị ka bụ ụmụaka.

It can be different with a new look.	Ọ nwere ike dị iche iche na anya ọhụrụ.
Police said they did not.	Ndị uwe ojii kwuru na ha emeghị.

You have too much money.	Ị nwere oke ego.

You feel like running.	Ọ dị gị ka ọ na-agba ọsọ.
But of course no one has.	Ma n'ezie ọ dịghị onye nwere.

They used other vehicles.	Ha ji ụgbọ njem ndị ọzọ.
That will be soon.	Nke ga-abụ n'oge adịghị anya.
That is a real problem.	Nke ahụ bụ ezigbo nsogbu.
Words are important for you to know how to do it.	Okwu bụ mkpa ka ị mara ka esi eme ya.
No one speaks.	Ọ dịghị onye na-ekwu okwu.
Certainly not tonight.	N'ezie ọ bụghị n'abalị a.
I eventually took the time to do it.	M mechara were oge mee ya.
Other books are different.	Akwụkwọ ndị ọzọ dị iche iche.
He waited four days.	O lere anya ụbọchị anọ.
They had three children.	Ha mụrụ ụmụ atọ.
She was afraid to be alone.	Ọ tụrụ egwu ịnọ naanị ya.
But you have something more powerful.	Ma i nwere ihe dị ike karịa.
No one did that.	Ọ dịghị onye mere nke ahụ.
Now is one of those times.	Ugbu a bụ otu n'ime oge ndị ahụ.
This should never happen again.	Nke a ekwesịghị ime ọzọ.
I will look for a way.	Aga m achọ ụzọ.
The weather is beautiful.	Ihu igwe mara mma.
There are reports of this bridge.	Enwere akụkọ gbasara akwa mmiri a.
That was my main point.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe m niile.
It is early in the morning.	Ọ bụ n'isi ụtụtụ ka.

They like to fight.	Ọgụ na-amasị ha.
It's my most beautiful car.	Ọ bụ ụgbọ ala m mara mma nke ukwuu.
You can hate it.	Ị nwere ike ịkpọ ya asị.
I am the boy.	Abụ m nwata nwoke ahụ.
It was a car to see if it was safe.	Ọ bụ ụgbọ ala ka ọ hụ ma ọ dị mma.
It's that simple.	Ọ dị mfe otú ahụ.
The second issue is this.	Okwu nke abụọ bụ nke a.
It is the night of the week.	Ọ bụ abalị otu izu.
No head and feet.	Enweghị isi na ụkwụ.
The water is like fire.	Mmiri ahụ dị ka ọkụ.
One will not work without the other.	Otu agaghị arụ ọrụ na-enweghị nke ọzọ.
You know yourself better than anyone.	Ị mara onwe gị karịa onye ọ bụla.
Many people came to the meeting.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ bịara nzukọ ahụ.
So it is with us now.	Otú ahụ ka ọnọdụ anyị dị ugbu a.
The boy enjoyed the event.	Ihe omume ahụ masịrị nwa ahụ mma.
There are no rules.	Enweghị iwu iwu.
The churches may look like that.	Ụka ndị ahụ nwere ike ịdị ka nke ahụ.
He was a childhood friend.	Ọ bụ enyi nwata.
It's hard enough.	O siri ike zuru oke.
For various reasons we cannot proceed with that.	N'ihi ihe dị iche iche anyị enweghị ike ịga n'ihu na nke ahụ.
This is four years.	Nke a bụ afọ anọ.
Not really, but it looks like that.	Ọ bụghị n'ezie, ma ọ dị ka otu ahụ.

Nothing upset her.	Ọ dịghị ihe were ya iwe.
In humans, they cannot see.	N'ime mmadụ, ọ dịghị nke ha pụrụ ịhụ.

It can be made easier.	Enwere ike ime ka ọ dị mfe.
Surprised, he took it.	O juru ya anya, o were ya.

I think about the house, seeing everyone, how it will be.	M na-eche banyere ụlọ, ịhụ onye ọ bụla, otú ọ ga-adị.
The drink was delicious.	Ihe ọṅụṅụ ahụ dị ụtọ.

He had something he wanted.	O nwere ihe ọ chọrọ.

So no matter what you think it looks like.	Ya mere, n'agbanyeghị ihe ị chere na ọ dị ka.
There are mirrors everywhere.	E nwere enyo ebe niile.
Only he can see it.	Ọ bụ naanị ya nwere ike ịhụ ya.
It’s almost like a movie trailer.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ dị ka ihe nkiri ihe nkiri.
It was a special time.	Ọ bụ oge pụrụ iche.

I planned my life around it.	M mere atụmatụ ndụ m gburugburu ya.
He was satisfied.	O juru afọ ya.
It works well.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Think of the thing and see the different colors.	Na-eche ihe ahụ ma hụ agba dị iche iche.
I come from a big city.	Esi m na nnukwu obodo.
Just thinking about it made me angry.	Naanị iche echiche banyere ya mere ka agba m iwe.
This beloved city is beautifully decorated for the holidays.	Obodo a hụrụ n'anya na-achọ mma nke ọma maka ezumike ahụ.
He would not know what was happening in the first place.	Ọ gaghị ama ihe na-eme na mbụ.
It only took a few minutes.	Ọ were naanị nkeji ole na ole.
Maybe he bought it as a gift for someone else.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ zụtara ya dị ka ihe onyinye maka onye ọzọ.
All schools should do the same.	Ụlọ akwụkwọ niile kwesịrị ime nke ahụ.
The other person can see that.	Onye nke ọzọ nwere ike ịhụ nke ahụ.
They both looked around.	Ha abụọ lere anya gburugburu.
I really have a problem with this.	Enwere m nsogbu na nke a n'ezie.

The girl is so sweet!	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ dị ụtọ nke ukwuu!
You know it's true.	Ị ma na ọ bụ eziokwu.
Tears fell.	Anya mmiri dara.
They are old.	Ha bụ ndị afọ.
This is my husband.	Nke a bụ di m.
Many people today are heavily in debt.	Ọtụtụ ndị taa ji nnukwu ụgwọ ji.
It has many other applications.	Ọ nwere ọtụtụ ngwa ndị ọzọ.
My wife has other plans.	Nwunye m nwere atụmatụ ndị ọzọ.
Okay, but so be it.	Ọ dị mma, mana otu ahụ.
It seems he has been doing this all his life.	Ọ dị ka ọ na-eme nke a ná ndụ ya niile.
So that makes sense.	Ya mere nke ahụ nwere ezi uche.
Almost everyone does it.	Ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ onye ọ bụla na-eme ya.
But there is still real fear.	Ma ezigbo egwu ka dị.
It's a little small.	Ọ dị obere obere.
However, there is a problem.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere otu nsogbu.
She applied for help.	O tinyere akwụkwọ maka enyemaka.
There isn’t much in it, but there is something.	Ọ dịghị ọtụtụ ihe na ya, ma e nwere ihe.
There will be no other place like it.	Agaghị enwe ebe ọzọ dị ka ya.
About three times.	Dị ka ugboro atọ.
Food is a real problem.	Nri bụ ezigbo nsogbu.
Which is the key.	Nke bụ isi ihe.
You did well.	Ị mere nke ọma.
Clinical studies are expected.	Ọmụmụ ụlọ ọgwụ na-atụ anya.

He lives near here.	O bi nso ebe a.

I just gave him the message.	Naanị m nyere ya ozi ahụ.
What happened to him?	Kedu ihe mere ya?
No wife, no children.	Enweghị nwunye, enweghị ụmụaka.
I saw it.	Ahụrụ m ya.
Can't say enough about the place.	Enweghị ike ikwu nke ọma gbasara ebe ahụ.
The city is an important industrial center.	Obodo bụ isi ụlọ ọrụ dị mkpa.
There is no restaurant there.	Enweghị ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ ebe ahụ.
That is faster than driving.	Nke ahụ na-agba ọsọ karịa ịnya ụgbọ ala.
Many tracks work the same way.	Ọtụtụ egwu na-arụ ọrụ otu ahụ.
What he did was wrong.	Ihe o mere adịghị mma.
He bought the items at the supermarket.	Ọ zụtara ihe ndị ahụ na nnukwu ụlọ ahịa.
I want to be successful.	Achọrọ m inwe ihe ịga nke ọma.
It is the only reason.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe kpatara ya.
And, the rest of us.	Na, ndị ọzọ n'ime anyị.
We do not need your help.	Anyị achọghị enyemaka gị.
This can be done in a variety of ways.	Enwere ike ime nke a n'ụzọ dị iche iche.
But another will come.	Ma ọzọ ga-abịa.

The situation is much like that.	Ọnọdụ ndị ahụ yiri nnọọ nke a.
But that is not the case.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị ihe.
Receive your truth thoroughly.	Nweta eziokwu gị nke ọma.
I don't know how to tell you what happened.	Amaghị m ka m ga-esi agwa gị ihe merenụ.
You should be ready for a little while but it is hard now.	Ị kwesịrị ịdị njikere maka obere oge mana ọ siri ike ugbu a.
He can do this.	O nwere ike ime nke a.
I hope it is not you.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ bụghị gị.
Unreasonably low ,.	Na-enweghị ezi uche ala,.
Within a few weeks, the disease was gone.	N'ime izu ole na ole, ọrịa ahụ kwụsịrị.
She is not afraid to speak her mind.	Ụjọ anaghị atụ ya ikwu uche ya.
No one should be here.	Ọ dịghị onye kwesịrị ịbụ ebe a.
It cannot go on like this.	Ọ nweghị ike ịga n'ihu otu a.
That is a big problem.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
If they can do that, they can do anything.	Ọ bụrụ na ha nwere ike ime nke ahụ, ha nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla.
However, there are several weaknesses.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ọtụtụ adịghị ike.
He entered his house.	Ọ banyere n'ụlọ ya.
But different.	Ma dị iche iche.
No father.	Enweghị nna.
She is sad.	Obi adịghị ya mma.
Only one land there.	Naanị otu ala n'ebe ahụ.
Hope is what keeps you going.	Olileanya bụ ihe na-eme ka ị na-aga.
He began to have poor thinking.	Ọ malitere inwe nsogbu iche echiche nke ọma.
You have speed.	Ị nwere ọsọ.
I'm not feeling well right now.	Adịghị m mma ugbu a.
Please stay where you are.	Biko nọrọ ebe ịnọ.
It started early the next morning.	Ọ malitere n'isi ụtụtụ echi ya.
The city is surrounded by it.	Obodo gbara ya gburugburu.
I did not know what to do.	Amaghị m ihe m ga-eme.
It was a great place to rest.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ebe izu ike ịnọ.
And many of my friends.	Na ọtụtụ ndị enyi m.
Then he might love her.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ pụrụ ịhụ ya n'anya.
I feel like every song has one.	Ọ dị m ka egwu ọ bụla nwere otu.
They do not really know what they are talking about.	Ha amaghị ihe ha na-ekwu n'ezie.
The story is not true.	Akụkọ ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
It’s there, by the way.	Ọ dị ebe ahụ, n'agbanyeghị.
How long.	Ogologo ole.
Pretty men don’t.	Ndị nwoke mara mma anaghị eme.
Bed linen is good for you, the doctor said.	Akwa akwa dị mma maka gị, dọkịta ahụ kwuru.
The suffering was worse than he had expected.	Ahụhụ ahụ bịara dị njọ karịa ka ọ tụrụ anya ya.
I don’t think it will be a week.	Echeghị m na ọ ga-anọ otu izu.
That is very difficult to do.	Nke ahụ siri nnọọ ike ime.

But it was just my hope.	Ma ọ bụ naanị olileanya m.
Not everyone will have it.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla ga-enwe.
I am a beautiful student.	Abụ m nwa akwụkwọ mara mma.
It can be faster than humans.	O nwere ike na ọsọ karịa mmadụ.
There is no value in running.	Ọ dịghị uru na-agba ọsọ.
The building would be there, facing us.	Ụlọ ahụ ga-adị ebe ahụ, chere anyị ihu.
I hope you are well.	Enwere m olileanya na ị dị mma.
Fear immediately began.	Ụjọ malitere ozugbo.
Nothing will happen.	Ọ dịghị ihe ga-eme.
It was a time of minimal tragedy.	Ọ bụ oge ihe egwu dị obere.
He looked at a tall, handsome man.	O lere ogologo nwoke mara mma anya.
No one knew it was there.	Ọ dịghị onye ma na ọ bụ ebe ahụ.
First, go ahead.	Nke mbụ, gaa n'ihu.
However, there is another effect that goes on the other side.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere mmetụta ọzọ nke na-aga n'akụkụ nke ọzọ.
Me and my mother.	Mụ onwe m na nne m.
We know where you work.	Anyị maara ebe ị na-arụ ọrụ.
Everything takes time.	Ihe niile chọrọ oge.
In our first year, we did that.	N'afọ mbụ anyị mere nke ahụ.
Go fast and fast!	Gaa ngwa ngwa na ngwa ngwa!
One has to have the courage to play the game.	Mmadụ ga-enwe obi ike ime egwuregwu ahụ.
Strength and courage.	Ike na obi ike.
There is no problem with girls.	O nweghị nsogbu na ụmụ agbọghọ.
That might give him some ideas.	Nke ahụ nwere ike inye ya ụfọdụ echiche.
Several studies are underway.	Ọtụtụ ọmụmụ na-aga n'ihu.
He traveled on foot.	O ji ụkwụ mee njem ya.
But they are doing well that way.	Ma ha na-eme nke ọma ụzọ.
To make sure you come.	Iji hụ na ị bịara.
Water is important, but not essential to food.	Mmiri dị mkpa, ma ọ bụghị dị mkpa ka nri.
I don’t know, not really.	Amaghị m, ọ bụghị n'ezie.
It’s fun and funny.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ ma na-atọ ọchị.
But she was wearing the perfect dress.	Ma o yi uwe zuru oke.
I don’t think that’s happening this year.	Echeghị m na nke ahụ na-eme n'afọ a.
Please help me find the problem.	Biko nyere m aka ịchọta nsogbu ahụ.
This would have been a tough game with both guys.	Nke a gaara abụ egwuregwu siri ike na mmadụ abụọ ahụ.
No, but something is happening.	Ọ bụghị, ma ọ dị ihe na-eme.
Hope for the better.	Olileanya, maka ndụ ka mma.
We did the same for men.	Otú ahụ ka anyị mere ụmụ nwoke.
The impact on performance is obvious in the short term.	Mmetụta dị na ọrụ doro anya n'ime obere oge.
When he abruptly stopped, they were both amazed.	Mgbe ọ kwụsịrị na mberede, ọ tụrụ ha abụọ n'anya.
They run as fast as they can, one by one.	Ha na-agba ọsọ ọsọ ka ha nwere ike, otu otu.
It may be alone.	O nwere ike ịbụ naanị ya.
Which is stupid, because it’s there.	Nke bụ nzuzu, maka na ọ dị ebe ahụ.
It's one of my favorite places to go.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ebe kacha amasị m ịga.

Otherwise, great book.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, nnukwu akwụkwọ.
Something else is there.	Ihe ọzọ dị n'ebe ahụ.

What a great day to live!	Ọ bụ nnukwu ụbọchị ịdị ndụ!

Some of us have seen it, some of us have not.	Ụfọdụ n’ime anyị hụrụ ya, ụfọdụ n’ime anyị ahụghị ya.
The feast lasted four days.	Oriri ahụ were ụbọchị anọ.

There is no reason not to do it for many reasons.	Enweghị ihe kpatara na enweghị ike ime ya maka ọtụtụ ihe.

But as soon as he liked it.	Ma ozugbo ọ masịrị ya.
The dancers surrounded.	Ndị na-agba egwu gbara gburugburu.
You have to use these things to empower yourself.	Ị ga-eji ihe ndị a mee ka onwe gị nwee ike.
The subject matter is good.	Isi okwu dị mma.

He still likes the woman.	Ọ ka na-amasị nwanyị ahụ.
I like it a lot.	Ihe na-atọ m ụtọ nke ukwuu.
Our students are demanding higher salaries.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ anyị na-achọ nnukwu ụgwọ ọnwa.
I like freshly brewed coffee.	Isi kọfị ọhụrụ na-amasị m.
The other situation is more than just an environmental problem.	Ọnọdụ nke ọzọ bụ karịa nsogbu ebe adịghị mma.
But not himself.	Ma ọ bụghị ya onwe ya.

But we can see that it is coming.	Ma anyị nwere ike ịhụ na ọ na-abịa.
We bought it almost 30 years earlier when our children were very young.	Anyị zụtara ya ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ afọ iri atọ tupu mgbe ahụ mgbe ụmụ anyị dị obere.

But there was someone else in the room.	Ma enwere onye ọzọ n'ime ụlọ ahụ.
They both look so happy.	Ha abụọ yiri nnọọ obi ụtọ.

He seems to like to see other women when he likes her.	O yiri ka ọ na-amasị ya ịhụ ụmụ nwanyị ndị ọzọ mgbe ọ masịrị ya.

The project required a lot of paperwork.	Ọrụ ahụ chọrọ ọtụtụ akwụkwọ.

The problem is that some players themselves.	Nsogbu bụ na ụfọdụ ndị egwuregwu n'onwe ha.

Your child is beautiful.	Nwa gị mara mma.
He travels with his dog.	Ya na nkịta ya na-eme njem ọnụ.
He is a good swimmer.	Ọ bụ ezigbo onye igwu mmiri.
A lot happened last year.	Ọtụtụ ihe mere n'afọ gara aga.

On the other hand this case may be of practical interest.	N'aka nke ọzọ ikpe a nwere ike ịbụ mmasị bara uru.
And the price.	Na ọnụ ahịa.
You may not know this as a sleep disorder.	Ị nwere ike ọ gaghị ama nke a dị ka nsogbu ụra.

I don't think he loves you.	Echeghị m na ọ hụrụ gị n'anya.

He used this method well for two reasons.	O ji ụzọ a mara nke ọma n'ihi ihe abụọ dị iche iche.
To continue where it left off.	Iji gaa n'ihu ebe ọ kwụsịrị.
He waited a little longer.	O chere obere oge.

Nothing came close to me.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọ bụla bịara nso m.

Employees of the company work.	Ndị ọrụ ụlọ ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ.

However, the staff.	Otú ọ dị, ndị ọrụ ahụ.

He wanted to see a movie.	Ọ chọrọ ịhụ ihe nkiri.
Thanks for me.	Daalụ maka m.
Of course, once upon a time, there was only one man.	N'ezie, otu mgbe, ọ bụ naanị otu nwoke.

You can use different colors.	Ị nwere ike iji agba dị iche iche.

Take it one day at a time.	Were ya otu ụbọchị n'otu oge.

In the past, much violence was committed.	N'oge mbụ, a na-eme ihe ike dị ukwuu.
He doesn't play football.	Ọ naghị agba bọọlụ.
On the ground side he looked back.	N'akụkụ ala o lere anya azụ.
That's awesome.	Nke ahụ dị egwu.
Teacher's permission required.	Achọrọ ikike onye nkuzi.
It needs to get out of here, far, fast.	Ọ dị mkpa ka ọ pụọ ebe a, dị anya, ngwa ngwa.

I like it because you can see people coming and going.	Ọ masịrị m n'ihi na ị nwere ike ịhụ ka ndị mmadụ na-abịa ma na-aga.
He went ahead and searched for a few more feet.	Ọ gara n'ihu wee chọọ ụkwụ ole na ole ọzọ.
He saw the best in people.	Ọ hụrụ ihe kacha mma n'ime ndị mmadụ.
And the people who think we are.	Na ndị ha chere na anyị bụ.

For me, however, it did.	Otú ọ dị, nye m, ọ mere.
Lots of questions.	Ọtụtụ ajụjụ.

But we must do the things that we love.	Ma anyị ga-eme ihe na-amasị anyị.
But now it’s happening at home.	Ma ugbu a, ọ na-eme n'ụlọ.
Not the same but they have different tastes.	Ọ bụghị otu ihe ahụ ma ha nwere mmasị dị iche iche.
Why is it that all the other groups have no one in them.	Gịnị kpatara na otu ndị ọzọ niile enweghị onye na ha.

Wait for something else.	Chere maka ihe ọzọ.
He said he had a musical instrument and he didn’t.	O kwuru na ya nwere igwe egwu na o nweghị.
Today, two things are happening.	Taa, ihe abụọ na-eme.

It's that simple.	Ọ dị mfe otú ahụ.
I know this is true.	Ama m na nke a bụ eziokwu.

But they are very clear.	Ma ha doro anya nke ọma.
He went to help them.	Ọ gara inyere ha aka.
It’s hard, he said.	O siri ike, o kwuru.
It's too scary.	Ọ dị oke egwu.
That is our only benefit.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị uru anyị bara.
The first place is sports.	Ebe mbụ bụ ịgba egwuregwu.
This is not a man.	Nke a abụghị mmadụ.
She does not want a husband who does only his own work.	Ọ chọghị di nke na-arụ naanị ọrụ ya.
Afraid to die.	Egwu anwụ.
I can believe it for myself.	Enwere m ike kwere ya n'onwe m.
I am fortunate to have them by my side.	Enwere m ihu ọma inwe ha n'akụkụ m.
He doesn't like me.	Enweghị mmasị na m.
The price of this delicious meal is reasonable.	Ọnụ ego nri a na-atọ ụtọ bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
That's where the girls go.	Ọ bụ ebe ahụ ka ụmụ agbọghọ ahụ gara.

The police were amazed at his courage.	Obi ike ya juru ndị uwe ojii anya.
Our plans require little time.	Atụmatụ anyị chọrọ obere oge.
However, whenever it is the same, it is not.	Otú ọ dị, mgbe ọ bụla ọ bụ otu ihe ahụ, ọ bụghị ya.
But everything has.	Ma ihe niile nwere.
It looks like a man with cold feet.	Ọ dị ka nwoke ahụ nwere ụkwụ oyi.

Some of the people are good but some are not.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ndị ahụ dị mma ma ụfọdụ adịghị.

Let's hope you like it.	Ka anyị nwee olileanya na ọ ga-amasị gị.
He hated his mother for this.	Ọ kpọrọ nne ya asị maka nke a.
In the game.	N'ime egwuregwu.
But he did not know why it was so.	Ma ọ maghị ihe mere nke a ji dị otú a.
He was looking for a fight.	Ọ nọ na-achọ ọgụ.
It is my name.	Ọ bụ aha m.
It swims well.	Ọ na-egwu mmiri nke ọma.

Success is still far away.	Ịga nke ọma ka dị anya.
Before that it was only what the law required.	Tupu ọ bụ naanị ihe iwu chọrọ.

I'll tell you the truth.	Aga m agwa gị eziokwu.
This is our highest priority.	Nke a bụ ihe kacha anyị mkpa.
He knew himself.	Ọ maara onwe ya.
Kind of awesome.	Ụdị dị egwu.
Some are worse than others.	Ụfọdụ dị nnọọ njọ karịa ndị ọzọ.
We each have our own room.	Anyị onye ọ bụla nwere ọnụ ụlọ nke ya.

No one has greater authority than he.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ikike karịa ya.
I'm glad he said.	Obi dị m ụtọ na o kwuru.
Of course, this is exactly what happened.	N'ezie, nke a bụ nnọọ ihe merenụ.

The girls ran very hard.	Ụmụ agbọghọ ahụ gbara ọsọ nke ọma n'ụzọ siri ike.
She wants a man, not a man.	Ọ chọrọ nwoke, ọ bụghị nwoke.
He gave me the money.	O nyere m ego ahụ.
We need to get away from them.	Anyị kwesịrị isi n'ebe ha nọ pụọ.
He does not need to say anything else.	Ọ dịghị ya mkpa ikwu ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
You know they are by our side.	Ị mara na ha nọ n'akụkụ anyị.
Not the first time it happened.	Ọ bụghị nke mbụ ya mere.
My head is clear again.	Isi m doro anya ọzọ.
It's my fault.	Ọ bụ nke ime m.
They need to speak.	Ha kwesịrị ikwu okwu.
We know our limitations.	Anyị ma ike anyị.
Everyone does it.	Onye ọ bụla na-eme ya.
They have facilities.	Ha nwere ụlọ ọrụ.
He told her once on the phone.	Ọ gwara ya otu ugboro na ekwentị.
Many tourists come here every year.	Ọtụtụ ndị njem na-abịa ebe a kwa afọ.
He was never imprisoned.	Ọ dịghị mgbe a tụrụ ya mkpọrọ.
For something new and fresh.	Maka ihe ọhụrụ na nke ọhụrụ.
He did not want money.	Ọ chọghị ego.

But it’s just a movie.	Ma ọ bụ naanị ihe nkiri.
If anyone can do this.	Ọ bụrụ na onye ọ bụla nwere ike ime nke a.
However, this situation is not the same as the one before us.	Otú ọ dị, ọnọdụ a abụghị nke dị n'ihu anyị.
Let's move on.	Ka anyị gaa n'ihu.
Of course, we know very little about it.	N'ezie, anyị maara ntakịrị ntakịrị banyere ya.
But it seems.	Ma o yiri ka.
They are both happy.	Ha abụọ nwere obi ụtọ.
He didn't seem to want anything from her.	Ọ dị ka ọ chọghị ihe ọ bụla n'aka ya.
She asked her son for money.	Ọ jụrụ nwa ya nwoke ego.
He is your father.	Ọ bụ nna gị.
I want you to stay here.	Achọrọ m ka ị nọrọ ebe a.
He tried to get out, but it was harder.	Ọ gbalịrị ịpụ, ma o siri ike karịa.
He knows a lot.	Ọ maara ọtụtụ ihe.
Now is my time.	Ugbu a, ọ bụ oge m.
I told everyone it was because of language problems.	Agwara m onye ọ bụla na ọ bụ n'ihi nsogbu asụsụ.

Having a car here is a problem.	Inwe ụgbọ ala n'ebe a bụ nsogbu.

Nothing happened to him.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla mere ya.
The land has a small rural area.	Ala ahụ nwere obere ime obodo.
For years.	Maka afọ.
However, the food is very wholesome.	Otú ọ dị, nri ahụ bara ezigbo uru.
I am talking about it here.	M na-ekwu maka ya ebe a.
They are all still scared.	Ha niile ka na-atụ egwu.
I need one.	Achọrọ m otu.
That's fine this time.	Nke ahụ dị mma n'oge a.
The room should be mental.	Ụlọ ahụ kwesịrị ịbụ nke uche.
He wants it all.	Ọ chọrọ ka o nweta ya niile.
This man is all mine.	Nwoke a bụ ihe niile m.
This house is on fire.	Ọkụ gbara ụlọ a.
It's great.	Ọ mara oke mma.
That was just in time.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ n'oge.
I was surprised they were there.	O juru m anya na ha nọ ebe ahụ.
We would be happy to help.	Obi ga-adị anyị ụtọ inye aka.
That’s a big deal there, baby.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ihe ebe ahụ, nwa.
I'd like to go hungry.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịhụ agụụ.
My mother asked me why.	Nne m jụrụ m ihe kpatara ya.
But there is.	Ma e nwere.
One very nice one.	Otu mara ezigbo mma.
We met him there.	Anyị zutere ya n'ebe ahụ.
I found my phone.	Ahụrụ m ekwentị m.

There are several ways to do this.	Enwere ụzọ dị iche iche isi mee nke a.
Only, nothing happens.	Naanị, ọ dịghị ihe na-eme.
But do it.	Ma mee ya.
Everything seems to be working.	Ihe niile yiri ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
Make your own life.	Mee ndụ nke gị.
I can’t do it on my own.	Enweghị m ike ime ya n'onwe m.
It may be a good day today.	O nwere ike ịbụ ezigbo ụbọchị taa.

Because I did the same thing.	N'ihi na nke m mere otu ihe ahụ.
I think he didn’t want to tell me.	Echere m na ọ chọghị ịgwa m.
That is no easy task.	Nke ahụ abụghị ọrụ dị mfe.
You do not like them?	Ị naghị amasị ha?
He looks into the distance, but his eyes are no longer.	O lere anya n'ebe dị anya, anya ya adịghị ndụ.
Of course it is a toy.	N'ezie ọ bụ ihe egwuregwu ụmụaka.
Tom is not there by himself.	Tom anọghị ebe ahụ n'onwe ya.
Everyone was happy in the face.	Obi dị onye ọ bụla mma n'ihu ahụ.
However, there is something wrong.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dị ihe adịghị mma.
His father was right.	Nna ya kwuru eziokwu.
There are only three reasons why this happens.	E nwere naanị ihe atọ mere ụdị ihe ahụ ji eme mmadụ.
In fact, almost everything about it is long.	N'ezie, ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ihe niile gbasara ya nwere ogologo.
That's it.	Ọ bụ ya.
He said nothing about it.	O nweghị ihe o kwuru gbasara ya.
He liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya.
We know what they are doing.	Anyị ma ihe ha na-eme.
It is difficult but important.	O siri ike mana ọ dị mkpa.
I said, thank you very much but no thanks.	M kwuru, daalụ nke ukwuu mana mba daalụ.
But the father did not know.	Ma nna ahụ amaghị.
It is something we do or are doing.	Ọ bụ ihe anyị na-eme ma ọ bụ na-eme.
I'm used to these things.	Ihe ndị a na-ama m ahụ́.
But not so in this case.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ahụ na nke a.
The other people in the room looked at each other.	Ndị ọzọ nọ n'ime ụlọ ahụ lere ibe ha anya.
He does nothing else.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ na-eme.
Have money and power.	Enwe ego na ike.
Not as low as you are.	Ọ bụghị ala dị ka ị dị.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Eji m n'aka na ị ma ihe nke ahụ bụ.
People do not die for what they know is not true.	Ndị mmadụ anaghị anwụ maka ihe ha maara na ọ bụghị eziokwu.
So we need to take action.	Ya mere, anyị kwesịrị ime ihe.
No problem, he said.	Nsogbu adịghị, o kwuru.
Has many tests.	Nwere ọtụtụ ule.
He plays football.	Ọ na-agba bọọlụ.
They like that.	Ihe ahụ na-amasị ha.
They come into our lives in a very special way.	Ha rutere na ndụ anyị n'ụzọ pụrụ iche.
On the phone.	Na ekwentị.
It may take a while.	Ọ nwere ike were obere oge.
One day here or here you will not be harmed.	Otu ụbọchị ebe a ma ọ bụ ebe a agaghị eme gị ihe ọ bụla.
Thanks but no.	Daalụ mana mba.
You are doing an important job.	Ị na-arụ ọrụ dị mkpa.
He seems to be serious.	O yiri ka ọ kpọrọ ihe.
So it will not be played.	Ya mere ọ gaghị egwu egwu.
My situation may be new.	Ọnọdụ m nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọhụrụ.
No words.	Enweghị okwu ọ bụla.
The teacher told him he was a good player.	Onye nkuzi gwara ya na ọ bụ ezigbo onye egwuregwu.
Help may be needed.	Enwere ike inwe enyemaka.
No one can tell him what to do.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ịgwa ya ihe ọ ga-eme.
I have a good doctor.	Enwere m ezigbo dọkịta.

But few people know.	Ma mmadụ ole na ole maara.
Your children know.	Ụmụ gị mara.
Therefore.	Ya mere.

That amount is worth it.	Ọnụ ego ahụ kwesịrị ya.
It's just a good kind.	Ọ bụ naanị ezigbo ụdị.
What does that seem to be the problem?	Gịnị yiri ka ọ bụ nsogbu ahụ?
He shook his head.	O were aka n'isi.
He was angry because he did not like it.	Iwe were ya n'ihi na ọ naghị adị ya mma.
Maybe he could talk to her the next night.	Ma eleghị anya, o nwere ike ịgwa ya okwu n'abalị ọzọ.
We ran as fast as we could.	Anyị gbara ọsọ ọsọ ka anyị nwere ike.
They are powerful.	Ha bụ ihe ndị dị ike.
But that is still the case.	Mana nke ahụ ka bụ ọnọdụ.
That's not what their mother did.	Nke ahụ abụghị nke nne ha kpatara.
He looked at his stomach.	O lere anya afọ ya.
He was there.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ.
It is better to get it here and now.	Ọ ka mma ị nweta ya ebe a na ugbu a.
What a good man you are.	Kedu ezigbo nwoke ị bụ.
We are very close to the big city.	Anyị nọ ezigbo nso na oke obodo.
He has a bad reputation.	O nwere aha ọjọọ.

He tried to find what he thought was best.	Ọ gbalịrị ịchọta ihe o chere kacha mma.
You have never been alive.	O nweghị mgbe ị dị ndụ.

So she started to cry.	Ya mere ọ malitere ibe ákwá.

Of course, this time they will do it.	N'ezie, oge a ha ga-eme ya.
Here there is something like the word.	Ebe a na enwere ihe dị ka okwu.
Of course, it is a big job.	N'ezie, ọ bụ nnukwu ọrụ.
Last week was definitely a tough one.	N'ezie izu gara aga siri ezigbo ike.
That is very simple.	Nke ahụ dị oke mfe.
They acted like a family rather than a sailor.	Ha mere ihe dị ka ezinụlọ karịa ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri.

Beautiful photos that make your mouth water.	Foto ndị mara mma nke na-eme ka ọnụ gị rie mmiri.

There are some people who want to talk to him.	E nwere ụfọdụ ndị chọrọ ịgwa ya okwu.
Water is a gay man.	Mmiri bụ nwoke nwere mmasị nwoke.
However, it is not that simple.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị otú ahụ dị mfe.
What do you think about these things ?.	Kedu ihe ị chere maka ihe ndị a?.
He will be my best friend.	Ọ ga-abụ ezigbo enyi m.
Almost every time it comes.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ mgbe ọ bụla ọ na-abịa.

The president's staff said no.	Ndị ọrụ onye isi ala kwuru na ọ nweghị.
He really has.	O nwere n'ezie.
I think he can do it.	Echere m na ọ nwere ike ime ya.

I will not be able to be strong.	Agaghị m enwe ike ịdị ike.
Like a mother, like a daughter.	Dị ka nne, dị ka nwa nwanyị.
Continue as long as you can.	Na-aga n'ihu ruo ogologo oge ị nwere ike.
Everywhere will happen.	Ebe ọ bụla ga-eme.
That is the main reason.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe kpatara ya.
I know his name.	Ama m aha ya.
He just pretended to be my friend.	Ọ na-eme naanị ka ọ̀ bụ enyi m.
Maybe you came for our daily news.	Ma eleghị anya, ị bịara maka akụkọ anyị kwa ụbọchị.
It can happen anywhere.	O nwere ike ime ebe ọ bụla.

The building is still there.	Ụlọ ahụ ka dị.

This interview took place indoors.	Ajụjụ ọnụ a mere n'ime ụlọ.

No other court can do that.	Ọ nweghị ụlọ ikpe ọzọ nwere ike ime nke ahụ.
That doesn't make sense.	Nke ahụ enweghị isi.
Still, there is work to be done.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọrụ dị.
He went once.	Ọ gara otu oge.
He was full.	O ji aka ya juru.
This is still very simple.	Nke a ka dị nnọọ mfe.
The last one would be stupid.	Nke ikpeazụ ga-abụ nzuzu.
The room is small but nice.	Ụlọ ahụ dị obere ma ọ dị mma.
This is a tough book.	Nke a bụ akwụkwọ siri ike.
He had a good family.	O nwere ezi ezinụlọ.
Her husband stole the money.	Di ya zuru ego ahụ.
It seems not.	Ọ dị ka ọ bụghị.
I looked at it again.	M lere ya anya ọzọ.
I know the family.	Amaara m ezinụlọ.
They are all three.	Ha niile ma atọ.
He mustered up the courage to speak.	O nwetara obi ike ikwu okwu.
The simple pleasure now is old-fashioned.	Ihe ụtọ ahụ dị mfe ugbu a bụ ihe ochie.
Is required.	Ihe achọrọ.
I know he will not do it.	Ama m na ọ gaghị eme ya.
Over the years.	Kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
That is who he is.	Nke ahụ bụ onye ọ bụ.
He pointed to his watch.	Ọ tụrụ aka na elekere ya.
This is still too much.	Nke a ka dị oke oke.
The man was as strong as he was.	Nwoke ahụ siri ike ka ya.
They really are.	Ha bụ n'ezie.
This work has yet to be completed.	Ọrụ a ka kwụsịrị.
It is very foolish to think that it can.	Ọ bụ nnọọ nzuzu iche na ọ nwere ike.
But this did not please him.	Ma nke a adịghị ya mma.
Word died.	Okwu ka ọ nwụrụ.
I do not really like it.	Ọ naghị amasị m n'ezie.
He still loves you.	Ọ ka hụrụ gị n'anya.

I tried it again.	M na-agbalị ya ọzọ.
I will not cry.	Agaghị m akwa ákwá.
But it's kind of crying right now.	Ma ọ bụ ụdị ibe ákwá ugbu a.
On the other hand.	N'aka ebe a.
We know that from our father.	Anyị maara nke ahụ site na nna anyị.
They are not who we are.	Ha abụghị ndị anyị bụ.
You do whatever he wants.	Ị na-eme ihe ọ bụla ọ chọrọ.

It took me a while to calm down.	O were m oge ka obi ruo m ala.
I am well aware of what we are.	M maara nke ọma ihe anyị bụ.
This will be the final challenge.	Nke a ga-abụ ihe ịma aka ikpeazụ.
Go for it.	Gaa na ya.
No one said different.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru dị iche iche.
We have good players.	Anyị nwere ezigbo ndị egwuregwu.
Nightmare.	Egwu abalị.
This is how it works here.	Otu a ka esi arụ ọrụ ebe a.
But he was satisfied.	Mana afọ juru ya afọ.
His father said he had a lot of ideas.	Nna ya kwuru na ya nwere ọtụtụ echiche.
The police were called in to fight the family once.	A kpọrọ ndị uwe ojii ka ha bịa ọgụ ezinụlọ otu oge.

The best thing for you is to give both groups what they like.	Ihe kacha mma maka gị bụ inye ndị otu abụọ ahụ ihe na-amasị ha.
You know it's true.	Ị maara na ọ bụ eziokwu.

It is simple in itself.	Ọ bụ ịdị mfe n'onwe ya.
He couldn’t help it here, he understood.	O nweghị ike inyere ya aka ebe a, ọ ghọtara.
He looked at his watch, then sat down.	O lere anya elekere ya, wee nọdụ ala.
Nothing makes sense here.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla nwere uche ebe a.
That could be an idea.	Nke nwere ike ịbụ echiche.
The worst thing that can happen is that they say no.	Ihe kacha njọ nwere ike ime bụ na ha asị mba.
It is the other side of everything.	Ọ bụ n'akụkụ nke ọzọ nke ihe niile.
A moment of truth.	Oge nke eziokwu.
How long ago it was.	Ogologo oge ole gara aga ka ọ dị.

However, it seems they will not.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dị ka ha agaghị.

That is the way they talked to him.	Otú ahụ ka ha si gwa ya okwu.
He can do it himself.	O nwere ike ime onwe ya ime nke a.
It speaks to the need for strategic planning.	Ọ na-ekwu maka mkpa ọ dị maka atụmatụ atụmatụ.
He had a great game anyway.	O nwere nnukwu egwuregwu n'agbanyeghị.
There are several reasons for this statement.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara okwu a.
The city needs good transportation, he says.	Obodo a chọrọ njem njem nke ọma, ọ na-ekwu.
The trees look terrible.	Osisi ndị ahụ yiri egwu.
He is a violent man.	Ọ bụ nwoke na-eme ihe ike.

But it is very strange.	Ma ọ bụ nnọọ anya.

We were there for dinner.	Anyị nọ ebe ahụ maka nri abalị.
This seems logical.	Nke a dị ka ezi uche.

He thought he was interested this afternoon.	O chere na o nwere mmasị n'ehihie a.
Travelers are looking for their own luggage.	Ndị njem na-eme njem na-achọ akpa nke ha.

We gave him permission.	Anyị nyere ya ikike.

And so on.	Na ihe ọzọ.

We have no such doubts.	Anyị enweghị obi abụọ dị otú ahụ.
Others say they can never do it.	Ndị ọzọ na-ekwu na ha enweghị ike isi ya ma ọlị.
It contains something, but we cannot find the books.	O nwere ihe dị n’ime ha, ma anyị apụghị ịhụ akwụkwọ ndị ahụ.
It is far from being evil.	Ọ dị nnọọ anya na ịbụ ihe ọjọọ.

We can use the one who has the right.	Anyị nwere ike iji onye nwere ikike ya.
This city has all kinds of problems.	Obodo a nwere ụdị nsogbu niile.
The word always condemns me.	Okwu ahụ na-ama m ikpe mgbe niile.
I enjoy other things now.	Ihe ndị ọzọ na-atọ m ụtọ ugbu a.
It is a different truth.	Ọ bụ eziokwu dị iche.
However, as mentioned earlier, this does not seem to work for everyone.	Otú ọ dị, dị ka e kwuru na mbụ, nke a adịghị ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka onye ọ bụla.
We should not say.	Anyị ekwesịghị ikwu.
This is only the first day.	Nke a bụ naanị ụbọchị mbụ.

He was confident that he had the authority.	Obi siri ya ike na o nwere ikike.
He left the city early the next morning.	Ọ hapụrụ obodo ahụ n'isi ụtụtụ echi ya.
Not in any way, or in any way.	Ọ bụghị n'ụzọ ọ bụla, ma ọ bụ n'ụzọ ọ bụla.
Extreme weather conditions made it difficult for people to rest.	Ọnọdụ ihu igwe ọjọọ mere ka ndị mmadụ ghara izu ike.

His words seemed to sound good.	Okwu ya yiri ka ọ dara nke ọma.

They will have great value in your company.	Ha ga-enwe nnukwu uru bara uru na ụlọ ọrụ gị.
Feel free to find something you like.	Echere na ịchọta ihe masịrị gị.
Many of the people were terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ ọtụtụ n’ime ndị ahụ.
Most of them do it themselves.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha na-eme onwe ha.
Those are for others.	Ndị ahụ bụ maka ndị ọzọ.

Gradually, the screams subsided.	Nke nta nke nta, mkpu ahụ kwụsịrị.

That is something we are well aware of.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị maara nke ọma.
That's the thing.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe.
Then we have.	Mgbe ahụ anyị nwere.
They are a different company.	Ha bụ ụlọ ọrụ dị iche.

You let that happen.	I kwere ka nke ahụ mee.
Spiritual stories abound.	Akụkọ gbasara mmụọ juru ebe ahụ.

You can do whatever you want.	Ị ga-eme ihe masịrị gị.
But there are good reasons.	Ma e nwere ụfọdụ ezi ihe kpatara ya.
But he began to think about it.	Ma ọ malitere iche echiche banyere ya.
That is a good question.	Nke ahụ bụ ezigbo ajụjụ.
He asked if this is how you can think about that.	Ọ jụrụ ma otu a ị nwere ike iche maka nke ahụ.
In fact, he seemed to be a good man.	N'ezie, ọ dị ka ezigbo mmadụ.

And worse in my career.	Na njọ na ọrụ m.
The plane can go very fast.	Ụgbọ elu nwere ike iji oke ọsọ na-aga.

They do not want another cold like the last.	Ha achọghị ka oyi ọzọ dị ka nke ikpeazụ.

But my story is not just about them.	Mana akụkọ m abụghị naanị maka ha.

He did not know how he came to be here.	Ọ maghị ka o si bịa ebe a.
Perfect for three people.	Zuru oke maka mmadụ atọ.
You do not do it for me.	Ị naghị eme m ya.
All actions take place in front of you.	Omume niile na-eme n'ihu gị.

So this story is important.	Ya mere akụkọ a ji dị mkpa.

The interview lasted three hours.	Ajụjụ ọnụ a were awa atọ.

No one reads them.	Ọ dịghị onye na-agụ ha.
Maybe she says, that she doesn’t want to face him.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ na-ekwu, na ọ chọghị iche ihu ya ihu.
This is not easy.	Nke a adịghị mfe.
No one told him what to do or where to stay.	Ọ dịghị onye gwara ya ihe ọ ga-eme ma ọ bụ ebe ọ ga-anọ.

I don't see anything wrong with that.	Ahụghị m ihe ọ bụla dị njọ na nke ahụ.

He continued and left the house.	Ọ gara n'ihu wee pụọ n'ụlọ.
Leaders are important.	Ndị isi dị mkpa.
Work has been going on for some time now.	Ọrụ na-aga n'ihu ruo oge ụfọdụ ugbu a.
People think of each other here.	Ndị mmadụ na-eche banyere ibe ha ebe a.
That is not true.	Nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
It is not a question of violence or not.	Ọ bụghị ajụjụ ime ihe ike ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị.
And dogs.	Na nkịta.
Four animals each.	Anụ anọ kwa otu.
So let's see if that happens.	Ya mere, ka anyị hụ na nke ahụ mere.
At first, it worked well.	Na mbụ, ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Probably not a good idea.	Eleghị anya ọ bụghị ezigbo echiche.
I can see it now.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ya ugbu a.
Last year it was nothing.	N'afọ gara aga ọ bụghị ihe ọ bụla.
Great bed.	Akwa akwa.
We have a good job.	Anyị nwere ezigbo ọrụ.
What works in one group does not always work in the other.	Ihe na-arụ ọrụ na otu anaghị arụ ọrụ mgbe niile na nke ọzọ.
But it is good.	Mana ọ dị mma.
Very soon.	Dị nnọọ nso nso.
There was nothing that he could do.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ pụrụ ime.
We were left with the dilemma of what to do.	A hapụrụ anyị nsogbu nke ihe anyị ga-eme.
Soon he came to it.	N'oge na-adịghị, ọ bịara na ya.
Take your word for it.	Were okwu gị dị ike.
But they want money.	Ma ha chọrọ ego.
The school is far from his home.	Ụlọ akwụkwọ ahụ dị n'ebe dị anya site n'ụlọ ya.
It's cold today, isn't it?	Oyi juru taa, ọ bụghị ya?
Today is a big day.	Taa bụ nnukwu ụbọchị.
The case is in court.	Okwu ahụ dị n'ụlọ ikpe.
Or so it is.	Ma ọ bụ otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
You look very pretty.	Ị mara ezigbo mma.
It is perfect.	O zuru oke.
I can't go on like this.	Enweghị m ike ịga n'ihu otu a.
Not that girl.	Ọ bụghị na nwa agbọghọ.
It is clear now.	O doro ya anya ugbu a.
What works for one family may not work for another.	Ihe na-arụ ọrụ maka otu ezinụlọ nwere ike ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ maka ezinụlọ ọzọ.
She is reading.	Ọ na-agụ akwụkwọ.
This is worse.	Nke a ka njọ.
People want to be like me.	Ndị mmadụ chọrọ ịdị ka m.
What a problem.	Kedu nsogbu.
I love our customers.	Ahụrụ m ndị ahịa anyị n'anya.
By the police, not theirs.	Site na ndị uwe ojii, ọ bụghị nke ha.
He knew himself when he saw him.	Ọ mara onwe ya mgbe ọ hụrụ ya.
The second is the fish industry.	Nke abụọ bụ ụlọ ọrụ azụ.
The debt continues.	Ụgwọ ahụ na-aga n'ihu.
I said it was not bad.	M kwuru na ọ dịghị njọ.
It has no effect.	O nweghị mmetụta.
You can help by news.	Ị nwere ike inye aka site na akụkọ.
So on and on.	Ya mere na ihe ndị ọzọ.
My friend's father died last week.	Nna enyi m nwụrụ izu ụka gara aga.
It can be awkward.	Ọ nwere ike ịdị na-adịghị mma.
They were not made for that.	Emeghị ha maka nke ahụ.
I think the school understood.	Echere m na ụlọ akwụkwọ ahụ ghọtara.
What one type requires is not the same as another.	Ihe otu ụdị chọrọ adịghị ka ụdị ọzọ.
The food is good, of course.	Nri dị mma, n'ezie.
Either way, it would be a problem if everyone knew.	Kedu ụzọ ọ bụla, ọ ga-abụ nsogbu ma ọ bụrụ na onye ọ bụla maara.
Sooner or later, you think of everything.	Mee elu mee ala, ị na-eche ihe niile.
They do not want money.	Ha achọghị ego.
The houses are beautiful.	Ụlọ ndị ahụ dị ezigbo mma.
I have one of them.	Enwere m otu n'ime ha.
But this is not doing well.	Mana nke a anaghị eme nke ọma.
Sweet, but fun.	Ụtọ na-atọ ụtọ, mana obi ụtọ.
If they want new.	Ọ bụrụ na ha chọrọ ọhụrụ.
So he looked at it.	Ya mere ọ lere ya anya.
We need something special.	Anyị chọrọ ihe pụrụ iche.
They are one person.	Ha bụ otu onye.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
My name is the only one who has nothing by his side.	Aha m bụ naanị onye na-enweghị ihe ọ bụla n'akụkụ ya.
So it is, still, to simplify the four words.	N'ihi ya, ọ ka dị, iji mee ka okwu anọ dị mfe.
First one, and another.	Mbụ otu, na ọzọ.
This church has a great history.	Ụka a nwere nnukwu akụkọ ihe mere eme.
That’s not scary though.	Nke ahụ adịghị egwu n'agbanyeghị.
The man had a car.	Nwoke ahụ nwere ụgbọala.
He died for us.	Ọ nwụrụ maka anyị.
But this did not happen.	Ma nke a emeghị eme.
He wanted her to know what they were talking about.	Ọ dị ya ka ya mara okwu ha maka ya.
Sometimes it is bad.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ dị njọ.
And you are.	Na ị bụ.
I have no doubt what it is.	Enweghị m obi abụọ ihe ọ bụ.
You can stay overnight, if you like.	Ị nwere ike ịnọ abalị, ma ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị.
It's a good feeling.	Ọ bụ mmetụta dị mma.
Its inhabitants are very different.	Ndị bi na ya dị nnọọ iche.
Good idea.	Ezigbo echiche.
He looked me in the eye and said.	O lere m anya n'anya wee sị.
He went.	O wee .
If the girl is small, she is not your sister.	Ọ bụrụ na nwa agbọghọ ahụ dị obere, ọ bụghị nwanne gị nwanyị.
He needs her day and night.	Ọ chọrọ ya ehihie na abalị.
They do things.	Ha na-eme ihe.
This is probably what you want.	Nke a bụ eleghị anya ihe ị chọrọ.
But not really.	Ma ọ bụghị n'ezie.
I don’t know what he saw in a man like me.	Amaghị m ihe ọ hụrụ na nwoke dị ka m.
And so on.	Na ihe ọzọ.
No one knows much about it.	Ọ dịghị onye maara nke ukwuu banyere ya.
It got me well.	O nwetara m nke ọma.
An employee drives a small car.	Otu onye ọrụ gbara obere ụgbọ ala.
He is coming before me now.	Ọ na-abịa n'ihu m ugbu a.
But then no one.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ dịghị onye.
People are still reading newspapers.	Ndị mmadụ ka na-agụ akwụkwọ akụkọ.
But not for food.	Ma ọ bụghị maka nri.
Thanks for that.	Daalụ maka nke ahụ.
New idea for me.	Echiche ọhụrụ maka m.
As if it were just another game.	Dị ka ọ bụ naanị egwuregwu ọzọ.
I entered immediately.	M banyere ozugbo.
Male and female.	Nke nwoke na nwanyị.
Make it worth it.	Mee ka ị kwesịrị.
People here are not fast.	Ndị mmadụ nọ ebe a anaghị adị ngwa ngwa.
Some coaches are stronger and more athletic than others.	Ụfọdụ ndị nkuzi siri ike na ndị egwuregwu karịa ndị ọzọ.
Most of me are not there now.	Ọtụtụ n'ime m anọghị m ugbu a.
He will not tell you.	Ọ gaghị agwa gị.
That is the rule of this game.	Nke ahụ bụ iwu egwuregwu a.
Then I stopped myself.	Mgbe ahụ kwụsịrị onwe m.
We were surprised.	O juru anyị anya.
The dog is very different.	Nkịta ahụ dị nnọọ iche.
I will do anything to help you, anything.	M ga-eme ihe ọ bụla iji nyere gị aka, ihe ọ bụla.
The others did nothing.	Ndị ọzọ emeghị ihe ọ bụla.
Perfect lover.	Onye hụrụ n'anya zuru oke.

It may be a day or two.	O nwere ike ịbụ otu ụbọchị ma ọ bụ abụọ.
The man seemed to know her well.	Nwoke ahụ yiri ka ọ maara nke ọma.
I do not know what people think or feel.	Amaghị m ihe ndị mmadụ na-eche ma ọ bụ mmetụta.
I will have it.	M ga-enwe ya.
And the situation is much better.	Na ọnọdụ ka mma karịa.
Where he waits.	Ebe ọ na-eche.
No home.	Enweghị ụlọ.
He thought he would go to the window.	Ọ chere na ọ ga-aga na windo.

He thought it was different.	O chere na ọ dị iche.
I will not do it.	Agaghị m eme ya.
Of course, that is not good.	N'ezie, nke ahụ adịghị mma.
I'll do it next time.	Aga m eme ya oge ọzọ.
Is the day we thought we could do.	Bụ ụbọchị anyị chere na anyị nwere ike ime.
A distance from the past of the city.	Ebe dị anya site n'oge gara aga nke obodo ahụ.
You can talk to him.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa ya okwu.
Thanks for your report.	Daalụ maka akụkọ gị.

There is only one thing to do.	Ọ dị naanị otu ihe a ga-eme.
That is what the police will do.	Ọ bụ ihe ndị uwe ojii ga-eme.
Many mothers are.	Ọtụtụ ndị nne bụ.
That is obvious.	Nke ahụ doro anya.
A new school is being built in the city.	A na-arụ ụlọ akwụkwọ ọhụrụ n'ime obodo ahụ.
I was waiting for you.	Anọ m na-eche gị.
They know you will come here.	Ha ma na ị ga-abịa ebe a.
This is no different.	Nke a adịghị iche.
He is a good believer.	Ọ bụ ezigbo onye kwere ekwe.
Find the second story.	Chọọ akụkọ nke abụọ.
I do not think you told me everything he said.	Echeghị m na ị gwara m ihe niile o kwuru.
Where we are then.	Ebee ka anyị nọ mgbe.
Be a child.	Bụrụ nwata.
Then the other lights were nearby.	Mgbe ahụ ọkụ ndị ọzọ dị nso.
Bad day.	Ụbọchị ọjọọ.
No one is at the door.	Ọ dịghị onye nọ n'ọnụ ụzọ.

This child may not do it, this child may not do it.	Nwa a nwere ike ọ gaghị eme ya, nwa a nwere ike ọ gaghị eme ya.
Many of the sailors went.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri gara.
Then he started to cry.	Mgbe ahụ ọ malitere ibe ákwá.
Sometimes for cheap.	Mgbe ụfọdụ maka ọnụ ala.
I have a little strength.	Enwere m ntakịrị ike.
It was a small car and he was a big man.	Ọ bụ obere ụgbọ ala na ọ bụ nnukwu nwoke.
Because that's what will happen.	N'ihi na nke ahụ bụ ihe ga-eme.
Let me be.	Ka m bụrụ.
Tell us what you know about this situation.	Gwa anyị ihe ị maara gbasara ọnọdụ a.
I did not know then that it was very bad.	Amaghị m mgbe ahụ na ọ bụ nnọọ ihe ọjọọ.
Do you want it to stay?	Ị chọrọ ka ọ nọrọ?
I don't want to do anything.	Achọghị m ime ihe ọ bụla.

He knew it was him no matter how far away he was.	Ọ maara na ọ bụ ya n'agbanyeghị ebe dị anya.
There are no words.	O nweghị okwu ọ bụla.
He wants to leave.	Ọ chọrọ ịla.
I think it's really good.	Echere m na ọ dị mma n'ezie.
I think people like to tell the truth.	Echere m na ndị mmadụ na-enwe mmasị ikwu eziokwu.
It is small, but very beautiful.	Ọ dị obere, ma mara mma nke ukwuu.
Man, the weather is awesome!	Nwoke, ihu igwe di egwu!
There are balls.	Enwere bọọlụ.
Not me with him, personally.	Ọ bụghị na m na ya, n'onwe ya.
The challenge, it seems.	Ihe ịma aka, ọ dị ka.
Better health for everyone!	Ahụ ike ka mma maka onye ọ bụla!
Can't say it well on our own.	Apụghị ikwu ya nke ọma n'onwe anyị.
There is no body.	Enweghị ahụ.
But there are many who want you to do it.	Ma enwere ọtụtụ ndị chọrọ ka ị mee ya.
But stay tonight.	Mana nọrọ n'abalị a.
And here we try to do the same.	Na ebe a anyị na-agbalị ime otu ihe ahụ.
He saw a new woman in her.	Ọ hụrụ nwanyị ọhụrụ n'ime ya.
Now things are different.	Ugbu a ihe dị iche.

You will use them more often.	Ị ga-eji ha eme ihe mgbe mgbe.
I need to be loved.	Ọ dị m mkpa ka a hụ m n'anya.
Both their work and their interests are important.	Ọrụ na mmasị ha abụọ dị mkpa.
Self is important here for two reasons.	Onwe dị mkpa ebe a maka ihe abụọ.
She is a good girl.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwa agbọghọ.
They are so beautiful all around.	Ha mara mma nke ukwuu gburugburu.
I'm not sure my staff will do it.	Ejighị m n'aka na ndị ọrụ m ga-eme ya.
Not just in practice, but in his life.	Ọ bụghị naanị na omume, ma na ndụ ya.
Can you tell me how to get to the port?	Ị nwere ike ịgwa m ka m ga-esi ruo ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri?
No words were spoken for a while.	O nweghị okwu e kwuru ruo nwa oge.
I don't want to talk about what's going on in my mind.	Achọghị m ikwu ihe na-eme n'obi m.
Everything is a fight.	Ihe niile bụ ọgụ.
But he is a good actor.	Mana ọ bụ ezigbo onye na-eme ihe nkiri.
Or you can.	Ma ọ bụ ị nwere ike.
It is better today.	Ọ ka mma taa.
It requires a second thought.	Ọ chọrọ echiche nke abụọ.
Not too much water.	Ọ bụghị oke mmiri mmiri.
It is an idea that is important.	Ọ bụ echiche nke bụ ihe dị mkpa.
Which is close.	Nke bụ nso.
And another night.	Na abalị ọzọ.
No one runs that way.	Ọ dịghị onye na-agba ọsọ otú ahụ.
He did it for himself.	O mere ya maka onwe ya.
What if there is no tomorrow?	Gịnị ma ọ bụrụ na e nweghị echi?

In fact, my life ended in a week.	N'ezie, ndụ m dara n'ime otu izu.

You may know it, or you are still young.	Ị nwere ike ịma ya, ma ọ bụ na ị ka dị obere.
However, it is good.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dị mma.
I do not know the difference.	Amaghị m ihe dị iche.
Children are wise.	Ụmụaka maara ihe.
It would be really nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma n'ezie.
That sounds like a shout out, right now.	Nke ahụ dị ka mkpu, ugbu a.
His own man.	Nwoke nke ya.

We feared that this would happen.	Anyị tụrụ egwu na nke a ga-eme.
Not yours, not mine, hers.	Ọ bụghị nke gị, ọ bụghị nke m, nke ya.
You have so many things.	Ị nwere ọtụtụ ihe.

It is very close for many.	Ọ dị nso nke ukwuu maka ọtụtụ.
Of course, it is beautiful.	N'ezie, ọ mara mma.
This is a real fear for many people.	Nke a bụ ezigbo egwu nye ọtụtụ ndị.
It says anything else you want to do in life, you can.	O kwuru ihe ọ bụla ọzọ ịchọrọ ime na ndụ, ị nwere ike.
But if he wants it, he's fine.	Mana ọ bụrụ na ọ chọrọ ya, ọ dị mma.

She seemed ready to get out of her skin.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị njikere ịpụ na akpụkpọ ahụ ya.
He has a good idea.	O nwere echiche dị mma.

It's not their interest.	Ọ bụghị mmasị ha.

He said so.	O kwuru otú ahụ.
I would not expect much from you.	Agaghị m atụ anya ọtụtụ ihe n'aka gị.

But they can have an immediate effect.	Ma, ha nwere ike inwe mmetụta ozugbo.

This is for the team here right now.	Nke a bụ maka onye otu nọ ebe a ugbu a.
It's not really scary.	Ọ bụghị egwu n'ezie.

He can't call it that.	O nweghị ike ịkpọ ya.
You said it.	I kwuru ya.
They try to make themselves and those around them better.	Ha na-agbalị ime onwe ha na ndị gbara ha gburugburu ka mma.
Nor is that a plan.	Ma ọ bụ nke ahụ bụ atụmatụ.
So this picture.	N'ihi ya, foto a.
It is good for me to eat.	Ọ dị mma ka m na-eri nri.
He waited for his day.	Ọ chere ụbọchị ya.
Hand in hand with him.	Aka ya na ya.
Now that is not true.	Ugbu a nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
But they will live or they will not be here.	Ma ha ga-adị ndụ ma ọ bụghị na ha agaghị anọ ebe a.
Some years are better than others.	Afọ ụfọdụ ka ndị ọzọ mma.

He was looking forward to another lesson.	Ọ nọ na-atụ anya nkuzi ọzọ.
Anyway, he went on.	Nke ọ bụla, ọ gara n'ihu.

He will spend one night in prison.	A ga-anọ n'ụlọ mkpọrọ otu abalị.
They still have their suffering though.	Ha ka nwere ahụhụ ha n'agbanyeghị.

This is not what he expected, from the girl.	Nke a abụghị ihe ọ tụrụ anya ya, n'aka nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
Only then will there be practice.	Mgbe ahụ naanị ka a ga-enwe omume.
So the trees did not use it.	Ya mere, osisi ndị ahụ ejighị ya.
You know that is not the case today.	Ị ma na ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka o si arụ ọrụ n'oge a.
But it is more than that.	Ma ọ karịrị nke ahụ.
But the difference is the case.	Ma ihe dị iche bụ ikpe ahụ.

Because that would happen.	N'ihi na nke ahụ ga-eme.

But they are not, and surely, it is not possible to do so.	Ma ha abụghị, ma n'ezie, ọ gaghị ekwe omume ime otú ahụ.
The idea is pointless.	Echiche ahụ enweghị isi.
The man has none.	Nwoke ahụ enweghị nke ọ bụla.

That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
We went for three hours.	Anyị gara awa atọ.

They are important.	Ha bụ ndị dị mkpa.
The head of state fell very heavily.	Onye isi ala ahụ dara nke ukwuu.
That's true.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu.
Now, of course, he did not want to be anything at that time.	Ugbu a, n'ezie, ọ chọghị ịbụ ihe ọ bụla n'oge ahụ.
We talk about anything and everything.	Anyị na-ekwu maka ihe ọ bụla na ihe niile.

You can see that.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ nke ahụ.
For me that is a good example of community.	Maka m nke ahụ bụ ezigbo ihe atụ nke obodo.

The boy is only ten years old.	Nwa nwoke ahụ dị naanị afọ iri.
Perfect exit.	Zuru oke ịpụ.

But the fact is that it never stopped.	Ma nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na ọ dịghị mgbe ọ kwụsịrị.

There is no way to know for sure, there is.	Enweghị ụzọ isi mara nke ọma, ọ dị.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Nke bụ eziokwu ka njọ.

Otherwise, you will not be in it.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ị gaghị anọ na ya.
This accident made history.	Ihe mberede a mere akụkọ.

Nice to see.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ.
When he got in front of me, he stopped.	Mgbe o rutere n'ihu m, ọ kwụsịrị.

Inside, there is a letter.	N'ime, e nwere akwụkwọ ozi.
Everyone got the same opportunity.	Onye ọ bụla nwetara otu ohere ahụ .
Not too cold, not too hot.	Ọ bụghị oke oyi, ọ naghị adị oke ọkụ.

So we now know what is happening.	Ya mere, anyị maara ugbu a ihe na-eme.
Sometimes we need money.	N'oge ụfọdụ anyị ga-achọ ego.
In times of anger, he was like their father.	N'oge iwe, ọ dị ka nna ha.

He looked around at others.	O lere ndị ọzọ anya gburugburu.

The problem is that he does not know what to do.	Nsogbu bụ na ọ maghị ihe ọ ga-eme.

There are more people there than ever before.	Enwere ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ n'ebe ahụ karịa ka ọ dị na mbụ.
Those things are not true here.	Ihe ndị ahụ abụghị eziokwu ebe a.

Not a movie at all.	Agaghị otu ihe nkiri.

That seems to help.	Nke ahụ yiri ka ọ̀ nyere aka.
Their house caught fire last night.	Ụlọ ha gbara ọkụ n'abalị ụnyahụ.
Not too fast.	Enweghị oke ọsọ.
Take a picture of him.	Were foto ya.

Of course, your journey may be different.	N'ezie, njem gị nwere ike ịdị iche.

He looked into the distance.	O lere anya n’ebe dị anya.
That may not be true.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ eziokwu.
The financial industry does a lot of work.	Ụlọ ọrụ ego na-arụ ọrụ dị ukwuu.
There is a good reason.	Ọ nwere ihe mere nke ọma.
So he wanted it to be bad.	Ya mere ọ chọrọ ka ọ dị njọ.
But he could not.	Ma o nweghị ike.
That is what happens to good people.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe na-eme ezigbo mmadụ.
It is more likely to be.	O yikarịrị ka ọ ga-adị.
I am thirsty.	Mmiri na-agụ m.

The water is cold.	Mmiri ahụ jụrụ oyi.
None of us can believe what we see.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị pụrụ ikweta ihe anyị hụrụ.
It's tough.	O siri ike.

So to speak.	Ya mere a na-ekwu.

Fortunately, it is not known for it.	Obi ụtọ, a maghị ya maka ya.
There are some good reasons for this.	Enwere ụfọdụ ezigbo ihe mere a ga-eji mee nke a.
I think it looks really good.	Echere m na ọ mara ezigbo mma.
That is the situation.	Nke ahụ bụ ọnọdụ.
They will not let you stop.	Ha agaghị ekwe ka ị kwụsị.
Fear has no power in your life.	Ụjọ enweghị ikike na ndụ gị.
All of this is true.	Ihe ndị a niile bụ ezi okwu.

So far, few people understand.	Ruo ugbu a, mmadụ ole na ole ghọtara ya.

I am here now to help you do this.	Anọ m ebe a ugbu a iji nyere gị aka ime nke a.
This is just our time.	Nke a bụ naanị oge anyị.

Nice to meet you all.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ unu niile.
I know this very well.	Amaara m nke ọma.
But no one is around, it seems.	Ma ọ dịghị onye nọ nso, ọ dị ka ọ dị.
I want to see this game played.	Achọrọ m ịhụ egwuregwu a na-eme.
And the other bosses, they love it.	Na ndị isi ndị ọzọ, ha hụrụ ya n'anya.
Of course, I do not like to do it.	N'ezie, anaghị amasị m ime ya.
Where is it going?	Ebee ka ọ ga-aga?
Come for dinner.	Bịa nri abalị.
Now he does not want it at all.	Ugbu a, ọ chọghị ya ma ọlị.
It is impossible.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
I feel like a good idea.	Ọ dị m ka ezi echiche.
Of course, some teachers do well in this task.	N'ezie, ụfọdụ ndị nkuzi na-eme nke ọma n'ọrụ a.
Nothing is well known.	Ọ dịghị ihe a maara nke ọma.
But here goes.	Ma ebe a na-aga.
This is harder than you think.	Nke a siri ya ike karịa ka i chere.
He loves music, of course.	Ọ hụrụ egwu n'anya, n'ezie.
That is a fact.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu ya.
You are very close to him.	Ị nọ ya nso nke ukwuu.

Which is too scary.	Nke bụ oke ụjọ oke.
Then you can succeed or enjoy.	Mgbe ahụ ị nwere ike ịga nke ọma ma ọ bụ ụtọ.
Nothing makes anything different.	Ọ dịghị ihe na-eme ka ihe ọ bụla dị iche.
Whatever the reason, anger eats away.	Ihe ọ bụla kpatara ya, iwe na-eri nri.
For the rest of us, there is hope.	Maka anyị ndị ọzọ, enwere olileanya.
See it and stop it.	Hụ ya ma kwụsị ya.
He did not want to be his parent.	Ọ chọghị ịbụ nne na nna ya.
Which house will be ours this afternoon?	Kedu ụlọ ga-abụ nke anyị n'ehihie taa?
I need money.	Achọrọ m ego.

You know you want !.	Ị maara na ị chọrọ!.
It runs a little, but is beautiful.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ ntakịrị, ma mara mma.
I don't like any games.	Enweghị m mmasị na egwuregwu ọ bụla.
He will need someone to help him there.	Ọ ga-achọ onye ga-enyere ya aka ebe ahụ.
He likes to drive his car.	Ọ na-amasị ya ịnya ụgbọ ala ya.
I never thought about it hard.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chere banyere ya ike.

My wife and I, everything is different.	Mụ na nwunye m, ihe niile dị iche.
The woman was evidently nervous.	O doro anya na ụjọ tụrụ nwanyị ahụ.
I like the fact that they are not small.	Enwere m mmasị na eziokwu ahụ bụ na ha anọghị ntakịrị.
I can see my feet clearly.	Ahụrụ m ụkwụ m nke ọma.
He really needs this work.	Ọ chọrọ n'ezie ọrụ a.
I can say that because it is true.	Enwere m ike ikwu nke ahụ n'ihi na ọ bụ eziokwu.
Because we have body, words and mind.	N'ihi na anyị nwere ahụ, okwu na uche.
Here, dogs play the role of pets.	N'ebe a, nkịta na-arụ ọrụ nke anụ ụlọ.
Things started to go wrong.	Ihe malitere ịdị njọ.
He was waiting in their friend's house.	Ọ nọ na-eche n'ụlọ enyi ha.
She is survived by three children.	Ọ hapụrụ ụmụ atọ.
Have players sit around.	Mee ka ndị egwuregwu nọrọ ọdụ na gburugburu.

But problems remain.	Ma nsogbu ka dị.

It is not good just to be free.	Ọ dịghị mma naanị inwe onwe gị.
Everything is in the past.	Ihe niile dị n'oge gara aga.
Not bad.	Ọ dịghị njọ.
You just need something else.	Naanị ị chọrọ ihe ọzọ.
She is a mother to me.	Ọ bụ nne n'ime m.
His happiness is my happiness.	Obi ụtọ ya bụ obi ụtọ m.
That is my word.	Nke ahụ bụ okwu m.
We are ready while you are there.	Anyị dị njikere mgbe ịnọ.
But the machine does not wait.	Mana igwe anaghị echere.
This is not for his opinion.	Nke a abụghị maka echiche ya.
The site for your items may be far away.	Ebe a na-atụ ihe gị nwere ike ịdị anya.
For him, it was his job.	Nye ya, ọ bụ ọrụ ya.
You can see again.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ọzọ.
Fighting violence is a daily occurrence in the community.	Ọgụ ime ihe ike bụ ihe na-eme kwa ụbọchị n'ime obodo.
Otherwise, it was a long trip to the room.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ bụ njem dị anya ruo n'ọnụ ụlọ.
I can not get out of this way.	Enweghị m ike ịpụ otu a.
After failing the test, he left school.	Ebe ọ dara ule, ọ hapụrụ ụlọ akwụkwọ.
There are several ways to do this.	E nwere ọtụtụ ụzọ isi mee nke ahụ.
We gave them everything.	Anyị nyere ha ihe niile.
Let's get this!	Ka anyị nweta nke a!
They are not alive.	Ha adịghị ndụ.
It was summer and the lights were perfect.	Ọ bụ oge okpomọkụ na ọkụ zuru oke.
Everything is on your side.	Ihe niile dị n'akụkụ gị.
Beautiful machine.	Igwe mara mma.
He put his hand inside her.	O tinyere aka ya n'ime ya.
He looked at the little dog carefully.	O lere obere nkịta anya nke ọma.
Side by side, side by side.	N'akụkụ, n'akụkụ.
They don’t see you for what you are.	Ha anaghị ahụ gị maka ihe ị bụ.
Give them this permission.	Nye ha ikike a.
This is true since you are a newcomer to this organization.	Nke a bụ eziokwu ebe ọ bụ na ị bụ onye ọhụrụ na nzukọ a.
He asked if you could have time for it today.	Ọ jụrụ ma ị nwere ike inwe oge maka ya taa.
We have each other.	Anyị nwere ibe anyị.
Things are happening fast.	Ihe na-eme ngwa ngwa.
No, not down.	Mba, ọ bụghị ala.
It will not continue for practical reasons.	Ọ gaghị aga n'ihu n'ihi ihe ndị bara uru.
At first, we asked many of them.	Na mbụ, anyị jụrụ ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
Not my opinion.	Ọ bụghị echiche m.
You have to help the team.	Ị ga-enyere ndị otu ahụ aka.
You want me to leave.	Ị chọrọ ka m pụọ.
I was really surprised to be here.	O juru m nnọọ anya ịnọ ebe a.
The buildings are well lit.	Ụlọ ndị ahụ gbara ọkụ nke ọma.
We are angry.	Iwe were anyị.
According to what they say.	Dị ka ihe ha na-ekwu.
You do what you have to do.	Ị na-eme ihe ị kwesịrị ime.
Now one thing.	Ugbu a otu ihe.
And food.	Na nri.
Many people do not understand their thinking.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ aghọtaghị echiche ha.
It looks like your mother is a real woman, though.	Ọ dị ka nne gị bụ ezigbo nwanyị, n'agbanyeghị.
But that may still be the case.	Ma nke ahụ ka nwere ike ịbụ ikpe ahụ.
Not here but elsewhere.	Ọ bụghị n'ebe a mana ebe ndị ọzọ.
Always before he allowed them to search for him.	Mgbe niile tupu o kwere ka ha chọọ ya.
If only that were true.	A sị nnọọ na nke ahụ bụ eziokwu.
That is what she really needs.	Nke ahụ dị ya ezigbo mkpa.
He loves sports.	Ọ hụrụ egwuregwu n'anya.
They understand that there is good and bad in life.	Ha ghọtara na ihe ọma na ihe ọjọọ dị ná ndụ.
And it's really out.	Ma ọ bụ n'ezie si.
We have no rest.	Anyị enweghị izu ike.
Her sons are cold.	Ụmụ ya nwoke jụrụ oyi.
Only ten people attended.	Naanị mmadụ iri bịara nzukọ ahụ.
Ask him to leave.	Gwa ya ka ọ pụọ.
We spent months planning the trip.	Anyị nọrọ ọnwa na-eme atụmatụ njem ahụ.
It makes sense.	Ọ bụ ezi uche.
The clock is the key to good family life.	Elekere bụ isi ihe na-eme ka ezinụlọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Everything is perfect.	Ihe niile zuru oke.
His heart almost stopped beating.	Obi ya fọrọ nke nta ka ọ kwụsị ya.
Little did they know that he heard them.	Ha amaghị na ọ nụrụ ha.
I have no case for that.	Enweghị m ikpe ọ bụla maka nke ahụ.
No big problem.	Enweghị nnukwu nsogbu.
It's really an energy character.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ihe gbasara ike agwa.
By the way, this is awesome.	Site n'ụzọ, nke a dị oke egwu.

I hope to see your old one again soon.	Enwere m olileanya ịhụ gị ochie gị ọzọ n'oge na-adịghị anya.
Not that the fire would make it more enjoyable.	Ọ bụghị na ọkụ ga-eme ka ọ na-atọ ụtọ karịa.

Or being somewhere else.	Ma ọ bụ ịbụ ebe ọ bụla ọzọ.
He heard the doctor talking.	Ọ nụrụ ka dọkịta na-ekwu okwu.
Take a big idea at home.	Were nnukwu echiche n'ụlọ.
There is no information on drug use.	Enweghị ozi gbasara iji ọgwụ eme ihe.
There are three of us.	Anyị dị atọ.
Which it could be.	Nke o nwere ike ịbụ.
But there is nothing you can do.	Mana ọ nweghị ihe ị ga-eme.
But something different happens.	Ma ihe dị iche na-eme.
Most of us have an ancestor.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ n'ime anyị nwere nna nna.
But time goes by in an unprecedented way.	Ma oge na-aga n'ụzọ na-enweghị atụ.
Very nice.	Dị oke mma.
Take your time, do it well first.	Were oge gị, mee ya nke ọma na mbụ.
The machine will live.	Igwe ahụ ga-adị ndụ.
But he said that they were not.	Ma o kwuru na ha abụghị.
That's all.	Ọ bụ ya niile.
Water is essential for life.	Mmiri dị mkpa maka ndụ.
Now you can log out.	Ugbu a ị nwere ike ịpụ.
That was another time, another time.	Nke ahụ bụ oge ọzọ, oge ọzọ.
There are many of them.	E nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
The game is fun for all ages.	Egwuregwu ahụ na-atọ ụtọ maka afọ niile.
He certainly never said it.	O doro anya na ọ dịghị mgbe o kwuru ya.
And you are not a good person.	Na ị bụghị ezigbo mmadụ.
We eat, drink, and sometimes we talk.	Anyị na-eri ihe, na-aṅụ ihe ọṅụṅụ, na mgbe ụfọdụ, anyị na-ekwu okwu.
It was my grandmother's name.	Ọ bụ aha nne nna m.
It would make sense.	Ọ ga-abụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
He was ready, he knew.	Ọ dị njikere, ọ maara.
So it comes with it.	Ya mere ọ na-abịa na ya.
We'd like to talk to you.	Ọ ga-amasị anyị ịgwa gị okwu.
It is a very beautiful book.	Ọ bụ akwụkwọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
New year, new life for us.	Afọ ọhụrụ, ndụ ọhụrụ nye anyị.
It will help him to think critically.	Ọ ga-enyere ya aka iche echiche nke ọma.
I have known him many times in my career.	Amaara m ya ọtụtụ oge na ọrụ m.
It should be a fun night.	Ọ kwesịrị ịbụ abalị na-atọ ụtọ.
So do we.	Anyị onwe anyị kwa.
The room has great special needs.	Ime ụlọ nwere nnukwu mkpa dị iche iche.
But it's a lot of the past.	Ma ọ bụ ọtụtụ ihe gara aga.
For some this is very simple, others are very difficult.	Maka ụfọdụ ndị nke a dị nnọọ mfe, ndị ọzọ siri nnọọ ike.
No way, baby.	Enweghị ụzọ, nwa.
It is a matter of community.	Ọ bụ ya bụ okwu obodo.
You are better.	Ị ka mma.
We can help those who need it.	Anyị nwere ike inyere ndị chọrọ enyemaka aka.
People know that he has good gifts.	Ndị mmadụ ma na ọ nwere ezigbo onyinye.
I do not know where he got the money.	Amaghị m ebe o nwetara ego ahụ.
There are few who can talk about it.	Ọ dị ole na ole ndị nwere ike ikwu banyere ya.
The people are angry.	Ndị obodo ahụ were iwe.
Calling you like it.	Ịkpọ gị dị ka ya.
Probably not.	O nwere ike ị gaghị abụ.
His brother was right.	Nwanne ya kwuru eziokwu.
I like doing things.	Ọ na-amasị m ime ihe.
I would be fine.	M ga-adị mma.
He is a very popular man.	Ọ bụ nwoke a ma ama.
He likes.	O nwere mmasị.
I saw his face.	Ahụrụ m ihu ya.
The plant is still in operation today.	Osisi ahụ ka na-arụ ọrụ taa.
It serves him right.	O kwesịrị ya.
Receive your truth well.	Nweta eziokwu gị nke ọma.
We knew it would go somewhere.	Anyị maara na ọ ga-aga ebe.
Not these days.	Ọ bụghị ụbọchị ndị a.
It will be everywhere.	Ọ ga-adị ebe niile.
And whatever it was before.	Na ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ na mbụ.
It's like having a good brother.	Ọ dị ka inwe ezigbo nwanne.
There is a drink.	Enwere ihe ọṅụṅụ.
This was likely done for two reasons.	O yikarịrị ka e mere nke a n'ihi ihe abụọ.
This does the job well.	Nke a na-arụ ọrụ ahụ nke ọma.
She is a famous woman.	Ọ bụ nwanyị a ma ama.
I was terrified.	Ụjọ na-ama m nke ukwuu.
You are an important man these days.	Ị bụ nwoke dị mkpa ụbọchị ndị a.
I have a daughter.	Enwere m nwa nwanyị.
Good on this one.	Ọ dị mma na nke a.
It is a good book.	Ọ bụ ezigbo akwụkwọ.
I think this is a little too much, though.	Echere m na nke a dị ntakịrị oke, n'agbanyeghị.
All those feelings are there.	Mmetụta ndị ahụ niile dị.
A man left when questioned by police.	Otu nwoke hapụrụ mgbe ndị uwe ojii jụrụ ya.
Some have good reasons to be.	Ụfọdụ nwere ezi ihe mere ha ga-eji bụrụ.
I do not really think.	Echeghị m n'ezie.
He knows the place.	Ọ maara ebe ahụ.
That is my job, to make this easy anyone can do.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ m, ime ka nke a dị mfe onye ọ bụla nwere ike ime ya.
It was good then.	Ọ dị mma mgbe ahụ.
Once he got into that, he was.	Ozugbo ọ banyere na nke ahụ, ọ bụ ya.
She gave birth to a son.	Ọ mụrụ nwa nwoke.
This city has a good reputation as a place of pleasure.	Obodo a nwere aha ọma dị ka ebe ụtọ.
No one can do everything.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ime ihe niile.
It is still small.	Ọ ka dị obere.
We really need that money.	Ego ahụ dị anyị mkpa n'ezie.
Few people have a big job.	Mmadụ ole na ole nwere nnukwu ọrụ.
I am happy today.	Enwere m obi ụtọ taa.
Another problem is lack of schooling.	Nsogbu ọzọ bụ n'ihi enweghị ụlọ akwụkwọ.
The tail of his tail is nothing more.	Nri ọdụ ya abụghị ihe ọzọ.
Thank you for what you have.	Daalụ maka ihe ị nwere.
Just a good thing.	Naanị ihe dị mma.
Very simple.	Dị nnọọ mfe.
Why not, he said.	Gịnị mere na ọ bụghị, o kwuru.
Last time.	Oge ikpeazụ.
Do this now!	Mee nke a ugbu a!
He told me he was in his room.	Ọ gwara m na ọ nọ n'ọnụ ụlọ ya.
I don't want him to be upset.	Achọghị m ka iwe were ya.
Price per person.	Ọnụ ego otu onye.
None of them knew what to do.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ha maara ihe ọ ga-eme.
See this another day.	Hụrụ nke a ụbọchị ọzọ.
The car is speeding.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ na-agba ọsọ ọsọ.
This can be as negative as a game.	Nke a nwere ike bụrụ ihe na-adịghị mma dị ka egwuregwu.
Handicrafts come at a high price here.	Ọrụ aka na-abịa na ọnụ ahịa dị elu ebe a.
But this is only for this example.	Mana nke a bụ naanị maka ihe atụ a.
Immediately bought a house, in which he still lives.	Ozugbo zụtara ụlọ, nke ọ ka bi na ya.
Every word goes well.	Okwu ọ bụla dara nke ọma.
This is very beautiful.	Nke a mara oke mma.
Obviously they hated my stomach.	O doro anya na ha kpọrọ afọ m asị.
Do more than you want to know.	Na-eme karịa ka ịchọrọ ịma.
I think things are not right.	Echere m na ihe adịghị mma.
He said they would.	O kwuru na ha ga-eme ya.
It looks like a dead body.	Ọ dị ka ihe nwụrụ anwụ.
The people are very angry.	Ndị mmadụ were nnọọ iwe.
That is good.	Nke ahụ dị mma.
I do not know if it was his fault.	Amaghị ma ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ ya kpatara ya.
He wants to leave.	Ọ chọrọ ịla.
At first he seemed unresponsive.	Na mbụ ọ dị ka ọ naghị anụ.
By that, he was the son of a family.	Site na nke ahụ, ọ bụ nwa nwoke nke ezinụlọ.
Not that kind.	Ọ bụghị ụdị ahụ.
He never became too close.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-enwe nnọọ enyi.
Only the obvious fear.	Naanị egwu doro anya.
Have fun having the best trip with your friends.	Nwee obi ụtọ ka gị na ndị enyi gị nwee njem kacha mma.
All three.	Ha atọ.
My people are traveling.	Ndị m na njem.
These are really my house shoes.	Ndị a bụ akpụkpọ ụkwụ ụlọ m n'ezie.
Nothing has happened since.	Ọ dịghị ihe mere kemgbe ahụ.
It doesn't seem hard, though.	O yighị ka o siri ike, n'agbanyeghị.
The story goes one way and then another.	Akụkọ na-aga otu ụzọ wee gaa ọzọ.
I spent time in this room.	Eji m oge na ụlọ a.
Maybe my father's name will be on it.	Ma eleghị anya, aha nna m ga-adị na ya.
You or anyone else.	Gị ma ọ bụ onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
He asked me how the school went today.	Ọ jụrụ m ka ụlọ akwụkwọ si gaa taa.
These two things are different as night and day.	Ihe abụọ a dị iche dị ka abalị na ehihie.
Nice to see you.	Obi dị m ụtọ ịhụ ya.
Think they will be high.	Chere na ha ga-adị elu.
Not so.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
Get out of the house.	Si n'ụlọ pụọ.
And it all, like everyone else, works.	Na ya niile, dị ka onye ọ bụla, na-arụ ọrụ.
They only have words and pictures.	Ha nwere naanị okwu ọnụ na foto.
He was there for me and he understood my needs.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ maka m ma ọ ghọtara mkpa m.
But you think.	Ma ị na-eche.
Only two people were killed in the fighting.	Naanị mmadụ abụọ nwụrụ na ọgụ ahụ.
The physical reason for this is obvious.	Ihe kpatara anụ ahụ maka nke a doro anya.
How many women ?.	Ụmụ nwanyị ole?.
They have great potential in this building.	Ha nwere ike dị ukwuu na ụlọ a.
I do not really want.	Achọghị m n'ezie.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
These are nothing more.	Ndị a abụghị ihe ọzọ.
It will feel like any other currency.	Ọ ga-adị ya ka ọ bụla ego ọzọ.
Or myself for that.	Ma ọ bụ onwe m maka nke ahụ.

He says we should be worse.	O kwuru na anyị kwesịrị ịdị njọ karịa.
I think the reason is obvious.	Echere m na ihe kpatara ya doro anya.
For everything else living.	Maka ihe ọ bụla ọzọ dị ndụ.
None of them work.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha na-arụ ọrụ.
And they do.	Na na ha na-eme.
Good job on that.	Ezigbo ọrụ na nke ahụ.
The rooms are very important.	Ime ụlọ ndị ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa.
I would know the dress anywhere.	Aga m ama uwe ahụ ebe ọ bụla.
We do not know what they want.	Anyị amaghị ihe ha chọrọ.

The river is known for its fish.	E ji azụ̀ mara osimiri ahụ.
I think he speaks when you talk about what surrounds him.	Echere m na ọ na-ekwu okwu mgbe ị na-ekwu maka ihe gbara ya gburugburu.
Many people liked the strong taste.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ masịrị ụtọ ahụ siri ike.
They have nothing, they want everything.	Ha enweghị ihe ọ bụla, ha chọrọ ihe niile.
It's beautiful, he thought.	Ọ mara mma, ka o chere.
That is for him.	Nke ahụ bụ maka ya.
It's addictive.	Ọ na-eri ahụ.
Elsewhere, life goes on.	N'ebe ndị ọzọ, ndụ na-aga n'ihu.
I am very strong.	Adị m nnọọ ike.
The city is famous for its handicrafts.	Obodo a ma ama maka ọrụ aka ya.

Football should be one of the most beautiful things about our community.	Bọọlụ kwesịrị ịbụ otu n'ime ihe mara mma gbasara obodo anyị.
There are many other home runs.	Enwere ọtụtụ ịgba ọsọ ụlọ ọzọ.

It's impossible.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
Everyone should be here.	Onye ọ bụla kwesịrị ịnọ ebe a.
Challenge myself to do better.	Na-ama onwe m aka ime ihe ka mma.
This is a key factor that has a significant impact.	Nke a bụ isi ihe nwere mmetụta bara uru dị mkpa.
That is a very important point.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe dị ezigbo mkpa.

The company made a lot of money and profits.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ nwetara nnukwu ego na uru.
The vacation lasted several hours.	Oge ezumike ahụ were ọtụtụ awa.

But what.	Ma gịnị.
That does not matter.	Nke ahụ adịghị mkpa.
Children were interviewed separately from their parents.	A gbara ụmụaka ajụjụ ọnụ iche na ndị mụrụ ha.

These events are unique in two ways.	Ihe omume ndị a pụrụ iche n'ụzọ abụọ.

He wants to leave.	Ọ chọrọ ka ọ pụọ.

He could not.	O nweghị ike.
But within limits.	Ma n'ime oke.
I tell them the same thing all the time.	Ana m agwa ha otu ihe ahụ mgbe ọ bụla.
There is no tomorrow here.	Enweghị echi ebe a.
This can be a difficult idea.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ echiche siri ike.
Of course that is the case here.	N'ezie nke ahụ bụ ikpe ebe a.
That's not fair.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma.
We entered the first town.	Anyị banyere n'ime obodo mbụ.
These vegetable dishes are delicious.	Nri akwụkwọ nri ndị a na-atọ ụtọ.
There is another person in the room.	E nwere otu onye ọzọ nọ n'ime ụlọ ahụ.
Tell you the same thing.	Gwa gị otu ahụ.
Apparently he told her something.	O doro anya na ọ gwara ya ihe.
It is perfect in itself.	O zuru oke n'ime onwe ya.
It will be very easy.	Ọ ga-adị nnọọ mfe.
He cares about people.	Ọ na-eche banyere ndị mmadụ.
But they keep going.	Ma ha na-aga n'ihu.
Now you and I are different.	Ugbu a mụ na gị dị iche.
I know it is.	Ama m na ọ bụ ya.
It's not fair.	Ọ dịghị mma.

As cold as you can see in this heat.	Dị ka oyi dị ka ị nwere ike ịhụ na okpomọkụ a.
But my opinion is weak.	Ma echiche m nwere adịghị ike.

If you have any concerns with our thinking, go to court.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere okwu ọ bụla na echiche anyị, gaa n'ụlọ ikpe.
This football uniform is very comfortable.	Uwe egwuregwu bọọlụ a dị ezigbo mma.

But he can see it again.	Ma ọ pụrụ ịhụ ya ọzọ.

Not many friends.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ndị enyi.
Almost every one of these things happened.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe a mere.
As a parent, you never feel trapped.	Dị ka nne ma ọ bụ nna, ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-adị gị ka ị na-eme nke ọma.
I was third last year and third last year.	Abụ m nke atọ n'afọ gara aga na nke atọ n'afọ gara aga.
But you are doing something wrong for a while.	Ma ị na-eme ihe ọjọọ nwa oge.
However, dogs are not dogs.	Otú ọ dị, nkịta abụghị nkịta.
But none of them saw anything special.	Ma ọ dịghị otu n’ime ha hụrụ ihe pụrụ iche.
With a message.	Na a ozi.
It will no longer be necessary.	Ọ gaghị adị mkpa ọzọ.

So stop doing great things about it.	Ya mere kwụsị ime nnukwu ihe banyere ya.
He did not know where.	Ọ maghị ebe.
Until we know whether it is true or not.	Ruo mgbe anyị maara ma ọ bụ eziokwu ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị.
His eyes are much smaller.	Anya ya dị obere karịa.
Lots of different emotions.	Ọtụtụ mmetụta dị iche iche.

In my head.	N'isi m.
Year of hope.	Afọ olileanya.
He liked to talk a lot.	Ọ masịrị ya ikwu okwu nke ukwuu.
I have information from him.	Enwere m ozi n'aka ya.
They hired him immediately.	Ha nyere ya ọrụ ozugbo.
Go for that, now.	Gaa na nke ahụ, ugbu a.
You need to think about the type of work here.	Ị kwesịrị iche echiche banyere ụdị ọrụ ebe a.
Only his mother.	Naanị nne ya.
The girl is very beautiful.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
But that is another matter.	Ma nke ahụ bụ okwu ọzọ.
You are with him.	Gị na ya nọ.
We are on a boat with you.	Anyị na gị nọ n'otu ụgbọ mmiri.
We are all here around him.	Anyị niile nọ ebe a gburugburu ya.
Like a real hunger.	Dị ka ezigbo agụụ.
It can be.	O nwere ike ịbụ.
So he has his own idea.	Ya mere o nwere echiche nke ya.
That's what he said.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe o kwuru.
This city needs good transportation.	Obodo a chọrọ njem njem nke ọma.
Words beautiful, well, beautiful.	Okwu mara mma, nke ọma, mara mma.
Then we go to the theater.	Mgbe ahụ, anyị na-aga ụlọ ihe nkiri.
You need to make it the cause.	I kwesịrị ime ka ọ bụrụ ihe kpatara ya.

I would have expected it.	M gaara atụ anya ya.
The players bowed their heads.	Ndị na-egwu egwu dara isi ala.
Going to the synagogue.	Ịga n'ụlọ nzukọ.
How many people died as a result?	Mmadụ ole nwụrụ n'ihi ya?
This dish is more delicious than last time.	Nri a na-atọ ụtọ karịa oge ikpeazụ.
I'm fine.	Adị m mma.
A strong corporate man, of course.	Nwoke ụlọ ọrụ siri ike, n'ezie.
Do your best.	Mee ihe kacha mma.
He, too, is clear.	Ya onwe ya kwa, doro anya.
It was my hometown.	Ọ bụ obodo a mụrụ m.
We had lunch and two.	Anyị riri nri ehihie na abụọ.
No.	Ọ dịghị.
The girl was right.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ kwuru eziokwu.
On your page, too.	Na ibe gị, kwa.
But doubts remain.	Ma obi abụọ ka dị.
But most people do not do it.	Ma ọtụtụ ndị anaghị eme ya.
He is very angry.	O were iwe nke ukwuu.
Every company is different.	Ụlọ ọrụ ọ bụla dị iche.
Very good.	Dị nnọọ mma.
I don't like it.	Ọ naghị adị m mma.
You know you have.	Ị maara na ị nwere.
No one was really scared.	Ọ dịghị onye tụrụ egwu n'ezie.
The weather is hot.	Ihu igwe dị ọkụ.
He is my friend.	Ọ bụ enyi m.
This is not for that.	Nke a abụghị maka nke ahụ.
You can go fast.	Ị nwere ike ịga ngwa ngwa.
To get a break.	Iji nweta ezumike.
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ gaghị amasị ya.
Imagine that you are a man.	Were ya na ị bụ nwoke.
I want to find something.	Achọrọ m ịchọta ihe.
You can see that no one is happy here.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ na ọ nweghị onye nwere obi ụtọ ebe a.
They know it for the sake of their lives.	Ha maara ya maka ndụ ha.
Some happy thoughts.	Ụfọdụ echiche obi ụtọ.
His story is here.	Akụkọ ya dị na nke a.
I do not know, they drink alcohol and take drugs.	Amaghị m, ha na-aṅụ mmanya na ihe na-eme ọgwụ ike.
You can call anyone you know.	Ị nwere ike ịkpọ onye ọ bụla ị maara.
However, he was ready for trial.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dị njikere maka ikpe.
On the other hand, you want the worst to succeed.	N'aka nke ọzọ, ị chọrọ ka ihe ọjọọ na-aga nke ọma.
Some may be with others.	Ụfọdụ pụrụ ma ndị ọzọ nọrọ.
With great power.	Na nnukwu ike.
The teachers and students love this school.	Ndị nkuzi na ụmụ akwụkwọ niile hụrụ ụlọ akwụkwọ a n'anya.
It's not just for a short time that it's hot.	Ọ bụghị naanị obere oge ka ọ dị ọkụ otú ahụ.
You do it.	Ị na-eme ya.
Take this as an example.	Were nke a dị ka ihe atụ.
They died soon after.	Ha nwụrụ n'oge na-adịghị anya.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
He put his hand over his mouth.	O tinyere aka ya n'ọnụ ya.
I always plan for a worse case scenario.	M na-eme atụmatụ mgbe niile maka ọnọdụ ikpe ka njọ.
And that's it.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ya.
That should not be an issue.	Nke ahụ ekwesịghị ịbụ okwu.
Not in this city.	Ọ bụghị na obodo a.
He went one day and one night.	Ọ gara otu ụbọchị na abalị.
It's not up to you.	Ọ bụghị gị na-eme.
You may or may not need to do this.	Ị nwere ike ma ọ bụ nwere ike ọ gaghị adị gị mkpa ime nke a.
If you have an idea, go for it.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere echiche, gaa maka ya.
No one talks about it because of it.	Ọ dịghị onye na-ekwu maka ya n'ihi ya.
He left us for a while.	Ọ hapụrụ anyị nwa oge.
Now he needs to tell her about his company.	Ugbu a, o kwesịrị ịgwa ya banyere ụlọ ọrụ ya.
It will not be easy to find.	Ọ gaghị adị mfe ịchọta.
This can be funny or violent or dramatic.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọchị ma ọ bụ ime ihe ike ma ọ bụ dị egwu.
He died before he could go to the hospital.	Ọ nwụrụ tupu ọ gaa ụlọ ọgwụ.
It comes in a minute.	Ọ na-abịa n'otu nkeji.
This is his chance.	Nke a bụ ohere ya.
Of course, I wouldn’t tell him how to play.	N'ezie, agaghị m agwa ya otú e si egwu egwu.
Know it.	Maara ya.
He would go to the doctor when he was a child.	Ọ ga-aga dọkịta mgbe ọ bụ nwata.
I love this game.	Ahụrụ m egwuregwu a n'anya.
The ground will be on the right side.	Ala ga-adị n'akụkụ aka nri.
As of course there is one.	Dị ka n'ezie e nwere otu.
That is what he said.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe o kwuru.
I like this new idea.	Echiche ọhụrụ a dị ka ọ na-atọ m ụtọ.
The leather of the boat is strong.	Akpụkpọ anụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ siri ike.
We did that.	Anyị mere nke ahụ.
But it does not seem to be bad.	Ma o yighị ka ọ dị njọ.
It requires action, hours and hours of its own.	Ọ na-achọ omume, awa na awa nke ya.
Which as you know it well.	Nke dị ka ị maara nke ọma.
Make the trip again.	Mere njem ahụ ọzọ.
It was the best day of his life.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị kacha mma ná ndụ ya.
How can you make sure that this does not happen?	Kedu otu ị ga-esi hụ na nke a emeghị?
So finding a man who wants to act fast.	Ya mere, ịchọta nwoke chọrọ ime ngwa ngwa.
Many children have died today.	Ọtụtụ ụmụaka nwụrụ taa.
On the face of it, everything is fine.	Na ihu ya, ihe niile dị mma.
This is the flesh.	Nke a bụ anụ ahụ.
The dogs began to cry.	Nkịta malitere ibe ákwá.
I just met his smile with one of mine.	M nnọọ zutere ọchị ya na otu nke m.
I like traveling.	Ọ na-amasị m ịga njem.
Really, really big.	N'ezie, n'ezie nnukwu.
Helping is key.	Inye aka bụ isi.
It is not perfect and simple.	Ọ bụghị nke zuru oke ma dị mfe.
I do not know what he is doing.	Amaghị m ihe ọ na-eme.
You are wrong.	Ị dị njọ.
i want to go	m na-achọ ịla.
I was afraid of what might happen to us.	Ụjọ na-atụ m iche ihe nwere ike ime anyị.
Someone will help him.	Mmadụ ga-enyere ya aka.
Eating is a debt-ridden car.	Iri na iri nri bụ ụgbọala ji ụgwọ.
It is easy to find.	Ọ dị mfe ịchọta.
I take them seriously.	Ejighị m ha egwu egwu.
Because he can do this.	N'ihi na o nwere ike ime nke a.
I have an idea.	Enwere m echiche.
At one point, nothing happened.	N'otu oge, ọ dịghị ihe mere.
That is his weakness.	Nke ahụ bụ adịghị ike ya.
Until then, we should be ready for anything.	Ruo mgbe ahụ, anyị kwesịrị ịdị njikere maka ihe ọ bụla.
We can ride a ball sometimes.	Anyị nwere ike ịnya bọọlụ mgbe ụfọdụ.
It is very clear what to do.	O doro anya nke ọma ihe e kwesịrị ime.
Now take me again.	Ugbu a were m ọzọ.
He put it well once.	O tinyere ya nke ọma otu ugboro.
They will not.	Ha agaghị eme.
I was very surprised.	Ọ tụrụ m n'anya nke ukwuu.
He was known for his rage.	E ji iwe iwe mara ya.
Or a father, for that matter.	Ma ọ bụ nna, maka nke ahụ.
This year is better.	Nke afọ a ka mma.
He likes to see his hands work.	Ọ na-amasị ya ịhụ ka aka ya na-eme ihe.
There has been no water here for four months.	Mmiri adịghị ebe a ọnwa anọ.
Who knows old.	Onye maara ochie.
I'm really happy.	Enwere m obi ụtọ n'ezie.
Our money can be used for good.	Ego anyị nwere ike iji mee ihe ọma.
I can see what you are doing.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ihe ị na-eme.
What you are doing is awesome.	Ihe ị na-eme dị egwu.
In his speech, he explained why he had been so successful.	Mgbe ọ na-ekwu okwu, o kwuru ihe mere o ji nwee ihe ịga nke ọma.
It will never be the same.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-abụ otu ihe ahụ.
Our phone will not work here.	Ekwentị anyị agaghị arụ ọrụ ebe a.
I like music very much.	Egwu na-amasị m nke ukwuu.
No one seems to know who actually owns the company.	Ọ dịghị onye yiri ka ọ maara onye n'ezie nwere ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
Because the game is unique.	N'ihi na egwuregwu ahụ pụrụ iche.
But we must move on.	Mana anyị kwesịrị ịga n'ihu.
Some customers go a little further sometimes.	Ụfọdụ ndị ahịa na-aga ntakịrị anya mgbe ụfọdụ.
In anger, tears welled up.	N'ime iwe, anya mmiri juru.
I'm just telling the truth.	M nnọọ na-ekwu eziokwu.
A few friends invited, but not many.	Ndị enyi ole na ole kpọrọ, ma ọ bụghị ọtụtụ.
This is really beautiful.	Nke a mara mma n'ezie.
These ideas are easy to think about.	Ọ dị mfe iche echiche ndị a.
If they can see it now.	Ọ bụrụ na ha nwere ike ịhụ ya ugbu a.
These buildings are known for their high cost.	A na-ama ụlọ ndị a n'ihi nnukwu ego ha.
Let me get the news right away about this.	Ka m nweta akụkọ ozugbo banyere nke a.
I do not run here.	Anaghị m agba ọsọ ebe a.
Many others fell ill.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ dara ọrịa.
Here, this hot water.	Ebe a, mmiri ọkụ a.
The weather is unparalleled.	Ihu igwe bụ ihe a ma ama enweghị atụ.
I have no authority over that.	Enweghị m ikike na nke ahụ.
The first step is to call for help.	Omume mbụ bụ ịkpọ maka enyemaka.
I am very happy.	Obi dị m ezigbo ụtọ.
This is the first commandment.	Nke a bụ iwu nke mbụ.
I'm sorry.	Ọ dị m nwute.
It's easy.	Ọ dị mfe.
The lie started when the couple met at a bar.	Ụgha ahụ malitere mgbe di na nwunye ahụ zutere n'ụlọ mmanya.
She was the girl of last night.	Ọ bụ nwa agbọghọ nke abalị gara aga.
That funny thing to look for.	Ihe ahụ ọ na-atọ ọchị na-achọ.
I do not expect what is happening with the money.	Anaghị m atụ anya ihe na-eme ego ahụ.
Quickly, he said.	Ngwa ngwa, o kwuru.
There are many of them.	E nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
He is a tyrant.	Ọ bụ aka ike.
He did not want to know what he thought.	Ọ chọghị ịma ihe ọ chere.
It is more than that.	Ọ karịrị nke ahụ.
Apparently they do for awesome photos.	O doro anya na ha na-eme maka foto dị egwu.
Hardly a woman.	O siri ike otu nwanyị.
Only one day we got to know each other.	Naanị otu ụbọchị ka anyị maara ibe anyị.
I can't get out, not now.	Enweghị m ike ịpụ, ọ bụghị ugbu a.
Which is a long time.	Nke bụ ogologo oge.
Time to go for lunch.	Oge iji gaa nri ehihie.
In it.	N'ime ya.
They scared me.	Ha tụrụ m ụjọ.
However, things did not turn out that way.	Otú ọ dị, ihe adịghị mma.
But it was difficult.	Mana o siri ya ike.
Do the same with everyone's name.	Mee otu ihe ahụ na aha onye ọ bụla.
What they want is a reasonable one.	Ihe ha chọrọ bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
But something else then.	Ma ihe ọzọ mgbe ahụ.
This is a beautiful town with few houses.	Nke a bụ obodo mara mma nke nwere obere ụlọ.
They stopped immediately.	Ha kwụsịrị ozugbo.
You know, that kind of person.	Ị mara, ụdị onye ahụ.
Do you think it's funny, makes people laugh?	Ị chere na ọ na-atọ ọchị, na-eme ndị mmadụ ọchị?
That its inhabitants are.	Na ya bi bụ.
I'm surprised you don't know this.	O juru m anya na ị maghị nke a.
I want to be strong in the cold.	Achọrọ m ịdị ike na oyi.
That is very good.	Nke ahụ bụ ezigbo mma.
He is alive now.	Ọ dị ndụ ugbu a.
However, that is not the case.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
Expect the best, but expect the least.	Na-atụ anya ihe kacha mma, ma na-atụ anya obere.
You really want to see your hand.	Ị chọrọ n'ezie ịhụ aka gị.
I was in front.	Anọ m n'ihu.
It’s just the kind of work that goes on.	Ọ bụ naanị ụdị ọrụ na-aga n'ihu.
Ten years earlier, that would have been his first thought.	Afọ iri tupu mgbe ahụ, ọ gaara abụ ihe mbụ o chere.
It is a state prison.	Ọ bụ ụlọ mkpọrọ nwere ọnọdụ.
As soon as he arrived.	Otu ngwa ngwa o rutere.
But no.	Ma mba.
It is love.	Ọ bụ ihu n'anya.
Pregnancy started at home.	Ime ime malitere n'ụlọ.
Police at the time.	Ndị uwe ojii n'oge ahụ.
They left.	Ha pụọ.
He has a spirit.	O nwere mmụọ.
I am no one else.	Abụ m na ọ dịghị onye ọzọ.
Would you please tell me the time, please?	Ị nwere ike ịgwa m oge, biko?
They should be one and the same.	Ha kwesịrị ịbụ otu na otu.
The music is a little annoying now.	Egwu ahụ dị ntakịrị iwe ugbu a.
An easy way to go.	Ụzọ dị mfe iji gaa.
The work ahead of them is daunting.	Ọrụ dị n'ihu ha siri ike.
He thought this idea was good.	O chere na echiche a dị mma.
As follows.	Dị ka ndị a.
My style, or its style.	Ụdị m, ma ọ bụ ụdị ya.
Some were born traveling.	Ụfọdụ ndị a mụrụ ime njem.
You love his drink.	Ị hụrụ ihe ọṅụṅụ ya n'anya.
It's cold.	Oyi dị.
It was the worst thing in my life.	Ọ bụ ihe kacha njọ ná ndụ m.
He spoke for an hour.	O kwuru okwu otu awa.
Then not much happens.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ dịghị ọtụtụ ihe na-eme.
She is OK.	Ọ dị ya mma.
A confident woman, she loved her family very much.	Nwanyị nwere obi ike, ọ hụrụ ezinụlọ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
I want to help children who want to get better.	Achọrọ m inyere ụmụaka ndị na-achọ ka mma aka.
That it is a way of life.	Na ọ bụ ụzọ ndụ.
Then move on.	Mgbe ahụ gaa n'ihu.
He did not have the first time, but he will have it now.	O nweghị oge mbụ, ma ọ ga-enwe ugbu a.
No high performance.	Enweghị ọrụ dị elu.
And we can see.	Na anyị nwere ike ịhụ.
It was hard, but he liked it.	Ọ siri ike, mana nke ahụ masịrị ya.
What people say about me does not scare me.	Ihe ndị mmadụ na-ekwu gbasara m anaghị atụ m egwu.
On the other hand, it is true.	Na ihe ọzọ, ọ bụ eziokwu.
He has lies about it.	Ọ nwere ihe ụgha gbasara ya.
Nothing else makes sense.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ nwere uche.
It doesn't seem to work.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ihe na-arụ ọrụ.
I was friends with a few people.	Mụ na mmadụ ole na ole n'onwe m bụ enyi.
I think some of them can still go on.	Echere m na ụfọdụ n'ime ha ka nwere ike na-aga n'ihu.
The same thing happened to me.	Otu ihe ahụ mere m.
It's funny.	Ọ bụ ihe ọchị.
He did a great job.	O mere nnukwu ọrụ.
He seems to be waiting for someone.	O yiri ka ọ na-eche mmadụ.
The temperature is good.	Ọnọdụ okpomọkụ dị mma.
It doesn't really matter.	Ọ dịghị mkpa n'ezie.
Two at a time.	Abụọ n'otu oge.
But it will not be.	Ma ọ gaghị adị.
Not required.	Achọghị.
All lies, lies, lies.	Ụgha niile, ụgha, ụgha.
So do one more, one more, one more.	Ya mere mee otu ọzọ, otu ọzọ, otu ọzọ.
Maybe to you they are nothing.	Ma eleghị anya, nye gị ha abụghị ihe ọ bụla.
Or my sister.	Ma ọ bụ nwanne m nwanyị.
The third is male and female.	Nke atọ bụ nke nwoke na nwanyị.
I don't know if it's another game.	Amaghị m ma ọ bụrụ egwuregwu ọzọ.
Some cravings said.	Agụụ ụfọdụ kwuru.
It's not easy.	Ọ dịghị mfe.
Only they know the best.	Naanị ha maara ihe kacha mma.
But your friend has no place to go.	Mana enyi gị enweghị ọnọdụ ịga njem.
It will not be.	Ọ gaghị anọ.
Then he was talking.	Mgbe ahụ ọ nọ na-ekwu okwu.
There but not there.	N'ebe ahụ ma ọ bụghị n'ebe ahụ.
This city has more cars than others.	Obodo a nwere ụgbọ ala karịa ndị ọzọ.
I am not one of those beautiful children.	Abụghị m otu n'ime ụmụaka mara mma.
Take it somewhere else.	Were ya ebe ọzọ.
It was about the same time.	Ọ bụ ihe dị ka otu oge ahụ.
He was angry.	Iwe were ya.
He was convinced that it was right to do so.	O doro ya anya na ọ dị mma ime otú ahụ.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
You make others afraid.	Ị na-eme ka ụjọ na-atụ ndị ọzọ.
His colleagues thought he was an unskilled worker.	Ndị ọrụ ibe ya chere na ọ bụ onye ọrụ na-enweghị isi.
He is in a difficult place.	Ọ nọ n'ebe siri ike.
You keep doing it.	Ị na-aga n'ihu na-eme ya.
But very bad.	Ma nke ukwuu dị njọ.
He could see tears coming.	O nwere ike ịhụ anya mmiri na-abịa.
She wanted more men.	Ọ chọrọ karịa ọtụtụ ụmụ nwoke.
We can only imagine what that might be.	Anyị nwere ike iche naanị ihe nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ.
This time he found himself alone in the room.	Oge a ọ hụrụ onwe ya naanị ya n'ime ụlọ.
We do the same thing.	Anyị na-eme ihe yiri nke ahụ.
But again, we don’t do it.	Ma ọzọ, anyị anaghị eme ya.
About yourself.	Ihe gbasara onwe gị.
The average hour of this hour goes on for twelve hours.	Aka nkeji nke elekere a na-aga n'ime awa iri na abụọ.
He was born in his time.	A mụrụ ya n'oge ya.
It's really beautiful.	Ọ mara mma n'ezie.
You are new to this.	Ị dị ọhụrụ na nke a.
Just his job.	Naanị ọrụ ya.
And the need for action.	Na mkpa ihe ime.
His face fell.	Ihu ya dara.
Thanks for following.	Daalụ maka ndị a.
Which seems to make it a desirable one.	Nke yiri ka ọ na-eme ka ọ bụrụ onye a chọrọ.
There may be more than that.	Enwere ike inwe ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
We need ideas.	Anyị chọrọ echiche.
Each company has its own employees.	Ụlọ ọrụ ọ bụla nwere ndị ọrụ ya.
But no one did it.	Ma ọ dịghị onye mere ya.
But then there is the company.	Ma mgbe ahụ, e nwere ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
Many varieties.	Ọtụtụ ụdị dị iche iche.
They have.	Ha nwere.
This is for my brother.	Nke a bụ nke nwanne m nwoke.
That is why we are here.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị ji nọrọ ebe a.
You can see that in everyone you meet.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ nke ahụ na onye ọ bụla ị zutere.
He loves it.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya.
No fire required.	Ọ dịghị ọkụ chọrọ.
No one said them.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru ha.
No, for being.	Mba, maka ịbụ.
But so far, it has worked well.	Ma ruo ugbu a, ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
I was at that point clearly in the emotion of the game.	Anọ m n'oge ahụ na o doro anya na mmetụta uche nke egwuregwu ahụ.
Why are you angry?	Gịnị mere i ji were iwe?
It is easy to say.	Ọ dị mfe ikwu.
They may be upset.	Ha nwere ike iwe iwe.
No one told us to do it.	Ọ dịghị onye gwara anyị ka anyị mee ya.
Women love it so much.	Ụmụ nwanyị hụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
I called his name, and he stopped.	M kpọrọ aha ya, ọ kwụsịrị.
My family lives there.	Ezinụlọ m bi ebe ahụ.
Girls, you know.	Ụmụ agbọghọ, ị maara.
It's just a question of time.	Ọ bụ naanị ajụjụ mgbe.
He asked her.	Ọ jụrụ ya.
Or you are not now.	Ma ọ bụ na ị bụghị ugbu a.
Locals fear for their lives.	Ndị obodo na-atụ egwu ndụ ha.
He got angry, or angry.	O were iwe, ma ọ bụ iwe were ya.
When he got to his side, he had a high feeling.	Mgbe o rutere n'akụkụ ya, ọ nwere mmetụta dị elu.
I try to eat a good diet.	M na-agbalị iri ezigbo nri.
He certainly said so.	O kwuru otú ahụ n'ezie.
And one thing is certain.	Na otu ihe doro anya.
Going for anger, one story.	Na-aga maka iwe, otu akụkọ.
She said that no one asked her if she needed help.	O kwuru na o nweghị onye jụrụ ya ma ọ̀ chọrọ enyemaka.
All is well.	Ihe niile dị mma.
He is afraid.	Ọ tụrụ ya ụjọ.
I am one of the customers.	Abụ m otu n'ime ndị ahịa.
It is this strong right that he will do.	Ọ bụ aka nri a siri ike ọ ga-eme.
We danced for hours	Anyị na-agba egwu ruo ọtụtụ awa
They are very angry.	Iwe were ha nke ukwuu.
But you have more money than is good.	Mana ị nwere ego karịa nke dị mma.
Everyone has their own truth.	Onye ọ bụla nwere eziokwu nke ya.
It's a good word.	Ọ bụ okwu dị mma.
This is exactly what they want.	Nke a bụ nnọọ ihe ha chọrọ.
Same thing with sewing machines.	Otu ihe eji akwa akwa akwa.
You can't do anything.	Ị gaghị eme ụdị ihe ọ bụla.
I'll tell you about it.	Aga m agwa gị maka ya.
In the distance, the boat caught fire.	N'ebe dị anya, ụgbọ mmiri gbara ọkụ.
I never made an application for two things.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m mere ngwa maka ihe abụọ.
You know where you want to go.	Ị maara ebe ịchọrọ ịga.
Until then, we should rest.	Ruo mgbe ahụ, anyị kwesịrị izu ike.
How much does it cost?	Ego ole ka ọ na-eme.
They came to paint.	Ha bịara agba.
It's really easy.	Ọ dị mfe n'ezie.
That's bad.	Na ọ dị njọ.
He said we would not do that.	O kwuru na anyị agaghị eme nke ahụ.
It is difficult to say which is better.	O siri ike ikwu nke ka mma.
Most people here are in one way or another.	Ọtụtụ ndị nọ ebe a nọ n'otu ụzọ ma ọ bụ ọzọ.
Everything happened by itself.	Ihe niile mere n'onwe ya.
His company is very beautiful.	Ụlọ ọrụ ya mara oke mma.
It took a long time.	O were ogologo oge a.
Now, it makes more sense.	Ugbu a, o mere ka uche karịa.
He has the truth.	O nwere eziokwu ya.
But there is still a limit.	Ma a ka nwere oke.
It was just like the movie was happy.	Ọ dị nnọọ ka ihe nkiri ahụ nwere obi ụtọ.
He knows as well as he knows his own name.	Ọ maara nke ọma otú ọ maara aha nke ya.
Very scary, uninteresting.	Ezigbo egwu, enweghị mmasị.
The messenger we want to leave.	Onye ozi anyị chọrọ ịpụ.
You are one of the last.	Ị bụ otu n'ime ndị ikpeazụ.
Fear as a child.	Ụjọ dị ka nwata.
It seems clear now that they are both.	Ọ dị ka ihe doro anya ugbu a na ha abụọ bụ.
Players start when they are ready.	Ndị egwuregwu malitere mgbe ha dị njikere.
There are two important ideas here.	Enwere echiche abụọ dị mkpa ebe a.
But there are some differences.	Ma e nwere ụfọdụ isi iche.
This is my one-day vacation this week.	Nke a bụ ezumike otu ụbọchị m n'izu a.
Or when in doubt.	Ma ọ bụ mgbe ị na-enwe obi abụọ.
Life is only for those who believe in it your way.	Ndụ naanị ndị kwere na ya ụzọ gị.
Regardless of our age, we are still young.	N'agbanyeghị afọ ole anyị dị, anyị ga-abụ nwata.
He told her to sit down wherever she wanted.	Ọ gwara ya ka ọ nọdụ ala ebe ọ bụla ọ chọrọ.
You should see me soon.	Ị kwesịrị ịhụ m ngwa ngwa.
We have that.	Anyị nwere nke ahụ.
He ate a little wine.	Mmanya riri ya ntakịrị.
He took a drink.	O were mmanya.
No news at the time.	Enweghị akụkọ ọ bụla n'oge.
Such a photo would require money.	Foto dị otú ahụ ga-achọ ego.
People can be very emotional because of the lack of any news.	Ndị mmadụ nwere ike na-enwe mmetụta nke ukwuu n'ihi enweghị akụkọ ọ bụla.
He had a daughter who was beyond his life.	O nwere nwa nwanyị nke karịrị ndụ ya.
Best day, of course.	Ụbọchị kacha mma, n'ezie.
I have a son like him	Enwere m nwa nwoke dị ka ya
He did not know how he knew.	Ọ maghị otú o si mara ya.
There is nothing interesting about it.	Ọ dịghị ihe nwere mmasị na ya.
But you always run.	Ma ị na-agba ọsọ mgbe ọ bụla.
Put on your clothes and go out!	Yiri uwe gị wee pụọ!
He is afraid of her.	Ọ tụrụ ya egwu.
Have the courage to do it.	Nwee obi ike wee mee ya.
He was obviously angry.	O doro anya na iwe were ya.
I think it was a great day.	Echere m na ọ bụ nnukwu ụbọchị.
Children are the responsibility of the community.	Ụmụaka bụ ọrụ nke obodo ahụ.
People say it's good.	Ndị mmadụ na-ekwu na ọ dị mma.
This idea is actually male and female.	Echiche a bụ n'ezie nwoke na nwanyị.
He looked at me intently.	O lere m anya nke ọma.
I need to get it right.	Ekwesịrị m ị nweta ya nke ọma.
We need to talk to them.	Anyị kwesịrị ịgwa ha okwu.
In practice this takes many different forms.	Na omume nke a were ọtụtụ ụdị dị iche iche.
We had a great day.	Anyị nwere ezigbo ụbọchị.
This is not just me.	Nke a abụghị naanị m.
Where do you work?	Ebee ka ị na-arụ ọrụ?
See the game.	Hụ egwuregwu.
Of course, they know very well.	N'ezie, ha maara nke ọma.
He understood people.	Ọ ghọtara ndị mmadụ.
I used it somewhere.	Eji m ebe nweta ya.
Give yourself time.	Nye onwe gị oge.
I do not want to know what you are talking about.	Achọghị m ịma ihe ị na-ekwu.
The captain provided first aid.	Onye isi ụgbọ mmiri ahụ nyere enyemaka mbụ.
Some of them may go.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ha nwere ike ịga.
His face did not seem to fit at all.	O yighị ka ihu ya ma ọlị.
Then he told me to leave.	Mgbe ahụ ọ gwara m ka m pụọ.
It was just a lie.	Ọ bụ naanị ụgha ọ gwara.
Not by all means.	Ọ bụghị n'ụzọ niile.
Without trees, nothing will survive.	Enweghị osisi, ọ dịghị ihe ga-adị ndụ.
But let it be so.	Ma ka ọ dị otú ahụ.
I enjoy doing it.	Ọ na-atọ m ụtọ ime ya.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
Lunch was almost as simple.	Nri ehihie fọrọ nke nta ka ọ dị mfe.
Do you need it now?	Ị chọrọ ya ugbu a?
I can't be the only one here.	Enweghị m ike ịbụ naanị onye ebe a.
If you are like me, people do not love you.	Ọ bụrụ na ị dị ka m, ndị mmadụ ahụghị gị n'anya.
At that time nothing could be better than this.	N'oge ahụ ọ dịghị ihe nwere ike ịdị mma karịa nke a.
Come on, take it easy.	Na na, na na, na na na.
Or just, it's really hard.	Ma ọ bụ naanị, ọ siri ike n'ezie.
Good job!	Ezigbo ọrụ!
Fear is just one factor for many.	Ụjọ bụ naanị otu ihe kpatara ọtụtụ ndị.
But it is.	Ma ọ dị.

It's a big meeting.	Ọ bụ nnukwu nzukọ.
If so, that's fine.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ nwere, ọ dị mma.
However, few people think about it.	Otú ọ dị, mmadụ ole na ole na-eche banyere ya.
They hate you.	Ha kpọrọ gị asị.
Know it as the back of my hand.	Mara ya dị ka azụ aka m.
I could not find his car.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ụgbọ ala ya.
I am not a mother to them.	Mụ na ha abụghị nne.
I did not do such a good thing.	Ihe ọma dị otú a emeghị m.
The work of the individual.	Ọrụ nke onye.
Get a vegetarian diet.	Nweta nri onye anaghị eri anụ.
I'm sure now.	Eji m n'aka ugbu a.
She is only three years old.	Ọ dị naanị afọ atọ.
He hated her for it.	Ọ kpọrọ ya asị maka ya.
That's not fair.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma.
All his life he was afraid.	Ná ndụ ya niile, ọ tụrụ egwu.
That you are the first person.	Na ị bụ onye mbụ.
Tonight is no different.	Abalị taa adịghị iche.
Definitely a place.	N'ezie ebe.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
I do not use my phone too much.	Anaghị m eji ekwentị m eme ihe nke ukwuu.
Or for mine.	Ma ọ bụ maka nke m.
He thought it was bad.	O chere na ọ dịghị mma.
This is yours.	Nke a bụ nke gị.
Because they want to do this.	N'ihi na ha na-achọ ime nke a.
I am nothing and no one.	Abụghị m ihe ọ bụla na ọ dịghị onye.
Just stay indoors.	Naanị nọrọ n'ime ụlọ gị.
He does not seem to be happy.	O yighị ka ọ na-enwe obi ụtọ.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.
To get home.	Iji ruo n'ụlọ.
They do not have them.	Ha enweghị ha.
He wants to leave.	Ọ chọrọ ka ọ pụọ.
But none of this is true.	Ma ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ya bụ eziokwu.
No one is making you leave.	Ọ dịghị onye na-eme ka ị pụọ.
But other times.	Ma oge ndị ọzọ.
Now my question.	Ugbu a ajụjụ m.
I like to love people.	Ọ na-amasị m ịhụ ndị mmadụ n'anya.
We have a clear view of the river.	Anyị nwere anya nke ọma banyere osimiri ahụ.
They can help with two things.	Ha nwere ike inye aka na ihe abụọ.
You wonder what will happen to your life.	Ị na-eche ihe ga-eme ndụ gị.
Other challenges but nothing less fun.	Ihe ịma aka ndị ọzọ mana ọ nweghị ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
They are the best thing in my life.	Ha bụ ihe kacha mma ná ndụ m.
That is what happens to you.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe na-eme gị.
They can talk to us at any time about why.	Ha nwere ike ịgwa anyị okwu oge ọ bụla gbasara ihe kpatara ya.
For some reason something does not happen.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ na-adịghị eme.
Very good quality.	Ezigbo mma n'ezie.
Let me give you the other one.	Ka m nye gị nke ọzọ.
There are three ways to do this.	Enwere ụzọ atọ isi mee nke ahụ.
There are no rules but yours.	Enweghị iwu ma ọ bụghị nke gị.
It's too scary.	Ọ dị oke egwu.
A tree where it will prosper.	Osisi ebe ọ ga-aga nke ọma.
In the ground, water.	N'ime ala, mmiri.
It's just the top of the foot.	Ọ bụ naanị elu ụkwụ ụkwụ.
No, that is not true.	Mba, nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
All points are good.	Isi ihe niile dị mma.
I'll talk to you.	Aga m agwa gị okwu.
He was a very busy man.	Ọ bụ nwoke ji ọrụ n'aka nke ukwuu.
It was the first time we actually saw him doing something.	Ọ bụ nke mbụ anyị hụrụ n'ezie ka ọ na-eme ihe.
There is nothing like it in trouble.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị ka ya na nsogbu.
Her father goes to work every morning.	Nna ya na-aga ọrụ kwa ụtụtụ.
If so, what can we do about it?	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ ihe ha chere, gịnị ka anyị ga-eme.
He ate the delicious food.	O ji obi ụtọ rie nri ahụ dị ụtọ.
But they are different.	Ma otú ha si dị iche.
Then the second.	Mgbe ahụ nke abụọ.
Somehow he had no friends.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ ọ na-enweghị enyi.
Not in his own time.	Ọ bụghị n'oge nke ya.
It looks great in a photo of her mother.	O zuru anya na foto nne ya.
It’s like a time of inactivity.	Ọ dị ka n'oge a na-adịghị arụ ọrụ.
Because he began to live.	N'ihi na ọ malitere ịdị ndụ.
My mind is pointless.	Uche m enweghị isi.
Everybody's been home for the last ten years.	Ọ bụla n'ụlọ kemgbe afọ iri gara aga.
They are all round.	Ha niile gbara gburugburu.
You left me that.	Ị hapụrụ m nke ahụ.
He told me not to go out.	Ọ gwara m ka m ghara ịpụ.
This is not easy.	Nke a adịghị mfe.
He really says you can.	Ọ na-ekwu n'ezie ị nwere ike.
He will do it if he can.	Ọ ga-eme ya ma ọ bụrụ na o nwere ike.
Happy with it, of course.	Obi ụtọ na ya, n'ezie.
Not for everyone.	Ọ bụghị maka onye ọ bụla.
You will not regret it.	Ị gaghị akwa ụta ọ bụla.
So they know about it.	Ya mere, ha maara banyere ya.
And those are my parents.	Na ndị ahụ bụ nne na nna m.
That sounds like something you have to do.	Nke ahụ dị ka ihe ị ga-eme.
Can't do that on my own.	Enweghị ike ime nke ahụ n'onwe m.
Tomorrow there is no doubt about it.	Echi enweghị obi abụọ banyere ya.
No doubt you got this picture.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na ị nwetara foto a.
Almost any price fell.	Ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ọnụ ahịa ọ bụla dara.
He has come a long way.	Ọ gara ebe dị anya.
Not so difficult.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ siri ike.

That is the kind of person he is.	Nke ahụ bụ ụdị onye ọ bụ.
It is man's work.	Ọ bụ ọrụ mmadụ.
Beauty has her ears behind.	Mma nwere ntị ya azụ.
Which is not good.	Nke na-adịghị mma.
It makes him who he is.	Ọ na-eme ka ọ bụrụ onye ọ bụ.
But such a thing is impossible.	Ma ụdị ihe ahụ agaghị ekwe omume.
He will not continue with it.	Ọ gaghị aga n'ihu na ya.
Say your sibling is interested.	Kwuru na nwanne gị nwere mmasị.
I want to feel bad.	Achọrọ m inwe mmetụta ọjọọ.
I do not know his name.	Amaghị m aha ya.
Not everyone is happy about finding a job.	Ọ bụghị mmadụ niile anaghị enwe obi ụtọ maka ịchọta ọrụ.
This should be.	Nke a kwesịrị ịbụ.
It's too strong.	O siri ike nke ukwuu.
What is the real situation.	Kedu ihe bụ ọnọdụ n'ezie.
How it really is.	Kedu ka ọ dị n'ezie.
They are his mother and much smaller.	Ha bụ nne ya ma dị obere karịa.
He does that a lot.	Ọ na-eme nke ahụ nke ukwuu.
However, a friend of his client knew about it.	Otú ọ dị, otu enyi onye ahịa ya maara banyere ya.
All of those things can be really anything.	Ihe ndị ahụ niile nwere ike ịbụ n'ezie ihe ọ bụla.
She said she felt scared and angry.	O kwuru na ọ dị ya ka ọ na-atụ ụjọ na iwe.
The teacher spoke well.	Onye nkuzi kwuru nke ọma.

He thought not at the same time.	O chere na ọ bụghị n'otu oge ahụ.
For several minutes.	Ruo ọtụtụ nkeji.

If only he hadn't wanted it so much!	A sị nnọọ na ọ chọghị ya nke ukwuu.

He looked at me.	O lere m anya.
There is something else happening here.	Ọ nwere ihe ọzọ na-eme ebe a.

He was clear.	O doro ya anya.
Awesome idea for me.	Echiche dị egwu nye m.

He does a lot of work in life.	Ọ na-arụ ọtụtụ ọrụ na ndụ.
I do not want myself.	Achọghị m onwe m.

They are big trees and require space.	Ha bụ nnukwu osisi ma chọọ ohere.

That was the first time he shot.	Nke ahụ bụ oge mbụ ọ gbara agba.
It will have its own function.	Ọ ga-enwe ọrụ nke ya.
That is more important.	Nke ahụ ka mkpa karịa.
But they are very different.	Ma ha dị nnọọ iche.
Probably not.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị.
They were a great team and really took the game to us.	Ha bụ nnukwu otu ma were egwuregwu ahụ n'ezie nye anyị.
He was amazed at how fast he ran.	Otú o si agba ọsọ ọsọ tụrụ ya n’anya.
That is easy.	Nke ahụ dị mfe.
It is nothing if not power.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọ bụla ma ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị ike ike.
Stop running too much, that’s fine.	Kwụsị ịgba ọsọ nke ukwuu, ọ dị mma.
This is not an easy task to get out of the door.	Nke a abụghị ihe dị mfe mmadụ ịpụ n'ọnụ ụzọ.
The main office is in this room.	Isi ụlọ ọrụ dị n'ime ụlọ a.
I want you if you are female or female.	Achọrọ m gị ma ọ bụrụ na ị bụ nwanyị ma ọ bụ nwanyị.
He has the right to say what he wants to say.	O nwere ikike ikwu ihe ọ chọrọ ikwu.
Of course, its position is one of the market.	N'ezie, ọnọdụ ya bụ otu n'ime ahịa.
The truth is.	Nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ.
Wait for the people.	Chere ndị ahụ.
But love this kind of work.	Ma hụrụ ụdị ọrụ a.
We do this temporarily.	Anyị na-eme nke a nwa oge.
It is powerful, beautiful in its own right.	Ọ dị ike, mara mma na nke ya.
I am always active.	A na m eme ihe mgbe niile.
He loves you.	Ọ hụrụ gị n'anya.
This is the event of the year.	Nke a bụ ihe omume nke afọ.
This year, it will be a little less.	N'afọ a, ọ ga-adị obere karịa.
Can anyone, please?	Enwere onye nwere ike, biko?
Our doctor called home and came to see us.	Dọkịta anyị kpọrọ ụlọ wee bịa hụ anyị.
The reason is absurd.	Ihe kpatara ya enweghị isi.
Other planes left him at a distance.	Ụgbọ elu ndị ọzọ hapụrụ ya n'ebe dị anya.
Take time with him.	Were oge na ya.
Far from it, of course.	N'ebe dị anya site na ya, n'ezie.

But before that, nothing.	Ma tupu nke ahụ, ọ dịghị ihe.
I don't want to tell you.	Achọghị m ịgwa gị.
We never go.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị na-aga.
He is not going anywhere.	Ọ naghị aga ebe ọ bụla.
Of course, I never did.	N'ezie, ọ dịghị mgbe m mere.
I believe that with all my heart.	Eji m obi m niile kwere nke ahụ.
He left the building for a while.	Ọ hapụrụ ụlọ ahụ nwa oge.
The trip took them from morning till noon.	Njem ahụ were ha n'ụtụtụ ruo n'ehihie.
He just wants to know what to do.	Ọ na-achọ naanị ịma ihe ọ ga-eme.
He is a man of power.	Ọ bụ onye ike.
No one did anything.	Ọ dịghị onye mere ihe ọ bụla.
Not everyone but that’s not the point.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla mana nke ahụ abụghị isi ihe.
All of this is in front of him.	Ihe a niile dị n'ihu ya.
Only four of them are perfect.	Naanị anọ n'ime ha zuru oke.
It's very pretty.	Ọ mara ezigbo mma.
Over the past three weeks.	N'ime izu atọ gara aga.
Some like me and you.	Ụfọdụ dị ka mụ na gị.
No good man does that.	Ọ dịghị ezigbo mmadụ na-eme otú ahụ.
This year, things are different.	N'afọ a, ihe dị iche.
I'm not sure at this time.	Ejighị m n'aka n'oge a.
That is if you think about clothes.	Nke ahụ bụ ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-eche banyere akwa.
I will see you next week.	Aga m ahụ gị n'izu na-abịa.
He was a wise man and a thinker.	Ọ bụ onye maara ihe na onye na-eche echiche.
My first ones.	Ndị mbụ m.
I don’t see this as a community problem.	Anaghị m ahụ nke a dị ka nsogbu obodo.
If you like it, let me know why.	Ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị, mee ka m mara ihe kpatara ya.
There should be many.	Ekwesịrị inwe ọtụtụ.
The man fell as he thought.	Nwoke ahụ dara ka ọ na-eche echiche.
Well, sleep is for the weak.	Ọ dị mma, ụra bụ maka ndị na-adịghị ike.
This is a pretty cool way.	Nke a bụ ụzọ mara mma mara mma.
We are foreigners.	Anyị bụ mba ndị si mba ọzọ.
It's really beautiful.	Ọ mara mma n'ezie.
Then we do the work.	Mgbe ahụ, anyị na-arụ ọrụ ahụ.
No water was supplied to the port.	Ọ dịghị mmiri e nyere ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
Get something new.	Nweta ihe ọhụrụ.
Of course not so bad.	N'ezie ọ dịghị njọ otú ahụ.
It can be fun, but not for everyone.	Ọ nwere ike na-atọ ụtọ, ma ọ bụghị maka onye ọ bụla.
But nothing close.	Ma ọ bụla ihe dị nso.
I can’t talk about it, ever.	Enweghị m ike ikwu maka ya, mgbe ọ bụla.
The situation is pleasant.	Ọnọdụ ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
This is with confidence.	Nke a bụ na obi ike.
No one left the house.	Ọ dịghị onye hapụrụ ụlọ ahụ.
And my sister.	Na nwanne m nwanyị.
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.

Only now you say you did.	Naanị ugbu a ị kwuru na i mere.
Just do it.	Naanị mee ya.
But let's not talk about it.	Ma ka anyị ghara ikwu banyere ya.
Severe weather is expected.	A na-atụ anya oge ihu igwe siri ike.
The living are dead.	Ndị dị ndụ nwụrụ anwụ.
This event went well.	Ihe omume a mere nke ọma.
He thinks it is something else.	Ọ na-eche na ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
But they can say something.	Ma ha nwere ike ikwu ihe.
We can have that.	Anyị nwere ike inwe nke ahụ.
And they did.	Ha wee mee ihe.
Then stay as low as possible.	Mgbe ahụ, nọrọ na ala dị ka o kwere mee.
Very strong.	Dị nnọọ ike.
This can help with problems sometimes.	Nke a nwere ike inye aka na nsogbu mgbe ụfọdụ.
But the old way died hard.	Ma ụzọ ochie nwụrụ ike.
It seems powerful.	O yiri ike.
He has a problem.	O nwere nsogbu chere ya ihu.
That would do it once and twice for him.	Nke ga-eme ya otu ugboro na ugboro abụọ maka ya.
I want people to like our music.	Achọrọ m ka egwu anyị na-amasị ndị mmadụ.
I love it so much.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
What a difference.	Kedu ihe dị iche.
But the worst.	Ma nke kacha njọ.
I would like to tell myself that it is impossible.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịgwa onwe m na ọ nweghị ike ime.
I don't think they know what to do with me.	Echeghị m na ha ma ihe ha ga-eme m.
They stayed like this for a long time.	Ha nọrọ otu a ogologo oge.
Staff will come and go.	Ndị ọrụ ga-abịa na-aga.
It is the power we all have.	Ọ bụ ike anyị niile nwere.
That was a few years ago.	Nke ahụ bụ afọ ole na ole gara aga.
I still love you.	Aka m hụrụ gị n'anya.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
Great help.	Enyemaka dị ukwuu.
I think it's stupid.	Echere m na ọ dị nzuzu.

Uncertain whether it is useful.	Ejighị n'aka ma ọ bara uru.
What happened then.	Gịnị mere mgbe.
Then you have a second.	Mgbe ahụ ị nwere nke abụọ.
That was the journey.	Nke ahụ bụ njem.
He is ready for me.	Ọ dị njikere maka m.
You have to make some really strong ideas there.	Ị ga-eme ụfọdụ ezigbo echiche siri ike ebe ahụ.
I was here with his order right away.	Anọ m ebe a na iwu ya ozugbo.
He hated the very thought of it.	Ọ kpọrọ echiche ya asị.
He loved it, you know.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya, ị maara.
At first that seemed like a good idea.	Na mbụ nke ahụ dị ka echiche dị mma.
He has a great father in him.	O nwere oke nna ya n'ime ya.
You want people to want to help you.	Ị chọrọ ka ndị mmadụ chọọ inyere gị aka.
He is very much concerned about each day that will come.	Ọ na-eche nnọọ banyere ụbọchị ọ bụla ga-abịa.
But next time.	Ma oge ọzọ.
The morning is coming.	Ụtụtụ na-abịa.
With great power.	Na oke ike.
He left his friend.	Ọ hapụrụ enyi ya.
As you know.	Dị ka ị maara.
Food is here.	Nri dị ebe a.
I took drugs to calm down.	M na-aṅụ ọgwụ ike ka obi ruo m ala.
Such was the original idea.	Echiche mbụ dị otú ahụ.
He walked around.	Ọ gara gburugburu.
For a bit.	Maka ntakịrị.
The butcher shop is in front of the port.	Ụlọ ahịa anụ anụ dị n'ihu ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri.
When you think it is nothing.	Mgbe ị chere na ọ nweghị ihe ọ bụla.
Do it any way you want.	Mee ya n'ụzọ ọ bụla masịrị gị.
Basically, this strategy is very bad.	N'ụzọ bụ isi, atụmatụ a dị nnọọ njọ.
He is my family member.	Ọ bụ onye ezinụlọ m.
The meat was strong, but the boy ate it.	Anụ ahụ siri ike, mana nwata ahụ riri ya.
I wish his doctor knew.	A sị m na dọkịta ya mara.
We love you so much.	Anyị hụrụ gị n'anya nke ukwuu.
The challenges we face may be greater than you think.	Ihe ịma aka ndị na-eche anyị ihu nwere ike ịdị ukwuu karịa ka ị chere.
But he never came.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bịara.
He did so.	O mere otú ahụ.
I arrived early in the morning and left early.	M rutere n'isi ụtụtụ wee pụọ n'oge.
It's just a big room.	Ọ bụ naanị nnukwu ọnụ ụlọ.
There is no point in running.	Enweghị isi ịgba ọsọ.
Two more cars are there now.	Ụgbọ ala abụọ ọzọ ebe ahụ ugbu a.
It is the way of his people.	Ọ bụ ụzọ ndị ya.
However, this is on time.	Otú ọ dị, nke a bụ n'oge.
I can only speak for myself.	Enwere m ike ikwu naanị maka onwe m.
This is a very beautiful idea.	Nke a bụ echiche mara mma nke ukwuu.
There are only.	Enwere naanị.
I said earlier.	M kwuru na mbụ.
I have no problem.	Enweghị m nsogbu ọ bụla.
They would like us to do this.	Ọ ga-amasị ha ka anyị mee nke a.
We never hated the police.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị kpọrọ ndị uwe ojii asị.
But that was last week.	Ma nke ahụ bụ izu gara aga.
That is not necessary for this example.	Nke ahụ adịghị mkpa maka ihe atụ a.
The water is cold.	Mmiri ahụ juru oyi.
He was a human.	Ọ bụ mmadụ .
Land surrounded the city.	Ala gbara obodo ahụ gburugburu.
This is very special for me.	Nke a bụ nnọọ ihe pụrụ iche nye m.
The city is like a dead city.	Obodo ahụ yiri obodo ndị nwụrụ anwụ.
I really think this works.	Echere m n'ezie na nke a na-arụ ọrụ.
The only thing is that he does not want to leave.	Naanị ihe bụ na ọ chọghị ịpụ.
Nothing was left open.	Ọ dịghị ihe hapụrụ ohere.
Well, you asked.	Ọ dị mma, ị jụrụ.
She is going to be his wife.	Ọ ga-abụ nwunye.
When they need a vacation.	Mgbe ha chọrọ ezumike.
Today it is very fun.	Taa na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
They could not, could not help it.	Ha enweghị ike, agaghị enwe ike inyere ya aka.
They did not understand.	Ha aghọtaghị ya,.
A complete vacation is required.	A chọrọ ezumike zuru oke.
See temperature.	Hụ ọnọdụ okpomọkụ.
The couple had no children.	Di na nwunye ahụ enweghị ụmụ.
This is fun.	Ihe a na-atọ ụtọ.
So it surprised me.	Ya mere, ọ tụrụ m n'anya.
They do not want them.	Ha achọghị ha.
Obviously he would use it.	O doro anya na ọ ga-eji ya mee ihe.
We enjoy books with good news.	Akwụkwọ ndị nwere akụkọ ọma na-atọ anyị ụtọ.
It was almost there.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ebe ahụ.
I think we are in big trouble.	Echere m na anyị nọ ná nnukwu nsogbu.
It was important then.	Ọ dị mkpa n'oge ahụ.
I do not like this.	Nke a anaghị amasị m.
Not a bad job.	Ọ bụghị ọrụ ọjọọ.
And he ate the game for us.	O wee rie anyị egwuregwu ahụ.
Trouble is his job.	Nsogbu bụ ọrụ ya.
I will do that in the morning.	Aga m eme nke ahụ n'ụtụtụ.
It is very beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
This is not just the same.	Nke a abụghị nnọọ otu.
I have a gradual feeling.	Enwere m mmetụta nke nta nke nta.
They did it a lot of ways.	Ha mere ọtụtụ ụzọ.
It was only obvious that he was angry.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe doro anya na iwe were ya.
There is still a lot of light for that.	A ka nwere ọtụtụ ọkụ maka nke ahụ.
And the character is awesome.	Na agwa dị egwu.
No one.	Enweghị onye ọ bụla.
We will have problems soon.	Anyị ga-enwe nsogbu n'oge adịghị anya.
He enjoys talking to others.	Ọ na-atọ ya ụtọ ịgwa ndị ọzọ okwu.
No idea on the right.	Enweghị echiche n'akụkụ aka nri.
I feel good.	Obi dị m mma.
I say something.	M na-ekwu ihe.
These are beautiful.	Ndị a mara mma.
I do not know where.	Amaghị m ebe.
The family did not know that the girl was pregnant.	Ezinụlọ ahụ amaghị na nwa agbọghọ ahụ dị ime.
Kind of great.	Ụdị akwa.
It's a great place.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ebe.
From here there is no other way.	Site ebe a enweghị ụzọ ọzọ.
But this did not happen in my life.	Ma nke a emeghị ná ndụ m.
Whatever it is.	Ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ.
So no one really knows that.	Ya mere ọ dịghị onye maara nke ahụ n'onwe ya.
There is no easy way, is it?	Ọ dịghị ụzọ dị mfe, ọ dị?
He thought it was impossible.	O chere na ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
But it will not happen.	Mana ọ gaghị eme.
They need to speak.	Ha kwesịrị ikwu okwu.
Buy coffee.	Zụta kọfị.
It is a gift.	Ọ bụ onyinye.
Most of us are not one.	Ọtụtụ n'ime anyị anọghị n'otu.
Said it was for the flesh.	Kwuru na ọ bụ maka anụ ahụ.
The reader makes the lives of many students easier.	Onye na-agụ akwụkwọ na-eme ka ndụ ọtụtụ ụmụ akwụkwọ dị mfe.
This time we can't.	Oge a anyị enweghị ike.
Is this bad?	Nke a ọ bụ onye ọjọọ?
The man was cruel.	Nwoke ahụ nwere obi ọjọọ.
I think it is important.	Echere m na ọ dị mkpa.
Words come from afar.	Okwu si n'ebe dị anya bịa.
The fish is fresh and delicious.	Azụ dị ọhụrụ ma na-atọ ụtọ.
Seeing people without fear of seeing.	Ịhụ ndị mmadụ na-enweghị egwu nke ịhụ.
I will not weep in his presence.	Agaghị m akwa ákwá n’ihu ya.
Three legs is three legs.	Ụkwụ atọ bụ ụkwụ atọ.
Not so much in itself.	Ọ bụghị nke ukwuu n'ime onwe ya.
Alone with his mother.	Naanị ya na nne ya.
There is something going on, but we do not know what.	Ọ nwere ihe na-eme, mana anyị amaghị ihe.
Some information may be outdated.	Ụfọdụ ozi nwere ike ịbụ ihe ochie.
That doesn't work here.	Nke ahụ anaghị arụ ọrụ ebe a.
No one knows why.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ihe mere o ji mee.
Or more at the top.	Ma ọ bụ karịa na elu.
They are very large and fast.	Ha dị nnọọ ibu na ngwa ngwa.
However, things did not turn out that way.	Otú ọ dị, ihe emeghị nke ọma otú ahụ.
So far away for anything else.	Ya mere, ebe dị anya maka ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
Then life can be achieved.	Mgbe ahụ enwere ike nweta ndụ.
His head looks big.	Isi ya yiri ibu.
It is not an easy task.	Ọ bụghị ihe dị mfe ime.
So they did what he said.	Ya mere, ha mere ihe o kwuru.
All life is a form of life.	Ụdị ndụ niile bụ ụdị ndụ.
For another four weeks.	Maka izu anọ ọzọ.
I think that makes sense.	Echere m na nke ahụ nwere ezi uche.
I immediately recovered.	Ahụ́ adị m mma ozugbo.
When you meet yourself.	Mgbe ị zutere onwe gị.
He is a good friend.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi.
The accident happened on the way.	Ihe mberede a mere n'ụzọ.
There is a house.	E nwere ụlọ.
When he was 13 years old.	Mgbe ọ dị afọ iri na atọ.
What did you say.	Kedu ihe i kwuru.
Our hands are just kind of doing it.	Aka anyị dị nnọọ ụdị ime ya.
I waited before my next meal.	M chere tupu nri ọzọ m.
Does that make sense?	Nke ahụ ọ̀ nwere ezi uche.
I don't like to talk.	Enweghị m mmasị ikwu okwu.
That doesn’t work, of course.	Nke ahụ anaghị arụ ọrụ, n'ezie.
That's how bad they are.	Otú ahụ ka ha si dị njọ.
Of course, they had plenty of food.	N'ezie, ha nwere ọtụtụ ihe oriri.
It makes you feel good.	Ọ na-eme ka ọ dị gị mma.
She is far away from home.	Ọ dị ya nnọọ anya n'ụlọ.
That is more than simple.	Nke ahụ karịrị ihe dị mfe.
This is a good book.	Nke a bụ ezigbo akwụkwọ.
But the fact is that there are other ways to do that.	Ma nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na e nwere ụzọ ndị ọzọ e si eme nke ahụ.
She is sad.	Obi adịghị ya mma.
But nothing.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe.
Everything you have to be strong.	Ihe niile ị ga-abụ siri ike.
They have a beautiful way of thinking about them.	Ha nwere ụzọ mara mma banyere ha.
It's just worth it.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe bara uru.
It will never happen.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-eme.
That's it.	Ọ bụ ya.
Anything you can think of.	Ihe ọ bụla ị nwere ike iche.
We come after everyone.	Anyị na-abịa n'azụ onye ọ bụla.
We make a person equal to everything.	Anyị na-eme mmadụ ka ọ̀tụ̀tụ̀ ihe niile.
To be honest.	Ikwu eziokwu.
It is hard to imagine because no one said anything about it.	O siri ike ka ọ dị adị n'ihi na ọ dịghị onye kwuru banyere ya.
From his father.	Site na nna ya.
Whatever this dog wants, it belongs to him.	Ihe ọ bụla nkịta a chọrọ, ọ bụ nke ya.
People viewed it as a bad thing.	Ndị mmadụ lere ya anya dị ka omume na-adịghị mma.
They have so many beautiful things.	Ha nwere ọtụtụ ihe mara mma.
He did his best.	O mere ihe kacha mma.
Do not want to see anything.	Achọghị ịhụ ihe ọ bụla.
The main story is another.	Isi akụkọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
We are in for a minute.	Anyị nọ n'otu nkeji.
You are not who others think you are.	Ị bụghị onye ndị ọzọ chere na ị bụ.
He himself said it.	Ya onwe ya kwuru ya.
This is good for me.	Nke a dị m mma.
If it is nothing, it is nothing.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị ihe ọ bụla, ọ bụghị ihe ọ bụla.
To make things faster, it works.	Iji mee ka ihe dị ngwa ngwa, ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
That's all.	Ihe niile bụ nke ahụ.
It came suddenly.	Ọ bịara na mberede.
I do not need your age, I need it.	Afọ gị adịghị m mkpa, ọ dị m mkpa.
This method is a daily practice.	Ụzọ a bụ ihe a na-eme kwa ụbọchị.
Not where you are.	Ọ bụghị n'ebe ahụ ị nọ.
Make your character as you wish them.	Mee ka agwa gị dị ka ịchọrọ ha.
But they were obviously happy.	Ma, o doro anya na obi dị ha ụtọ.
I still have many questions.	M ka nwere ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
You'd better stay home here.	Ọ ga-adị gị mma ịnọ n'ụlọ ebe a.
Just love it.	Naanị hụ ya n'anya.
Unable to see behavior at this limit.	Enweghị ike ịhụ omume na oke a.
I do not understand why he is here.	Aghọtaghị m ihe kpatara o ji nọrọ ebe a.
Perfect and beautiful.	Zuru oke ma mara mma.
Unreasonable, unreasonable.	Ihe ezi uche na-adịghị na ya, enweghị uche.
Not so with girls.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka ọ dị ụmụ agbọghọ.
These truths are important.	Eziokwu ndị a dị mkpa.
The meeting may still be going on.	Nzukọ ahụ nwere ike ka na-aga n'ihu.
It's very pretty.	Ọ mara ezigbo mma.
He did not know what to do.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ ga-eme.
She was terrified.	Ahụ nọ na-atụ ya.
The week is good, the weekend is not.	Izu ahụ dị mma, izu ụka adịghị.
She said she needed his help.	O kwuru na ya chọrọ enyemaka ya.
But he felt they should not be.	Ma o chere na ha ekwesịghị ịbụ.
He did not want to know what happened next.	Ọ chọghị ịma mgbe ahụ ihe na-eme ọzọ.
I saw her in the distance.	Ahụrụ m ya n'ebe dị anya.
They are not to be taken lightly.	E kwesịghị iji ha egwu egwu.
He thought there was a place.	O chere na enwere ebe.
It happens all the time.	Ọ na-eme mgbe niile.
I feel like everything you said to me is a lie.	Ọ dị m ka ihe niile ị gwara m bụ ụgha.
And other children.	Na ụmụaka ndị ọzọ.
He is wise.	Ọ bụ ya maara ihe.
Or a price.	Ma ọ bụ ọnụ ahịa.
A fire broke out in a theater.	Ọkụ gbara na ụlọ ihe nkiri.
You spoke to them this morning.	Ị gwara ha okwu n'ụtụtụ a.
Think of them as people.	Were ha dị ka ndị mmadụ.
Each study lasted about two hours.	Ọmụmụ ihe ọ bụla were ihe dị ka awa abụọ.
You should not feel bad for anything.	I kwesịghị inwe mmetụta ọjọọ maka ihe ọ bụla.
It cannot go on like this.	Ọ nweghị ike ịga n'ihu otu a.
This photo does not look like you.	Foto a adịghị ka gị.
I'm sure it won't.	Eji m n'aka na ọ gaghị eme.
He was obviously looking forward to the opportunity to speak.	O doro anya na ọ nọ na-atụ anya ohere ikwu okwu.
I have no reason.	Enweghị m ihe kpatara ya.
But this is such a day.	Ma nke a bụ ụbọchị dị otú ahụ.
A few things are very important.	Ihe ole na ole dị ezigbo mkpa.
There is a lot of money in it.	E nwere nnukwu ego na ya.
They added a third.	Ha tinyere nke atọ.
By the man himself.	Site na nwoke ahụ n'onwe ya.
Most of them live near here.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha, ọtụtụ n'ime ha bi nso ebe a.
French told them about us.	French gwara ha banyere anyị.
The front and back of this page are the same !.	Ihu na azụ nke ibe a bụ otu!.
What a high.	Kedu ihe dị elu.
Its length is several feet.	Ogologo ya dị ọtụtụ ụkwụ.
Telling stories is probably true.	Na-ekwu akụkọ eleghị anya eziokwu.
Their families did not do so.	Ezinụlọ ha emeghị ụdị ihe ahụ.
The only doubt he said about their destination.	Naanị obi abụọ o kwuru gbasara ebe ha na-aga.
Another day or two, maybe.	Ụbọchị ọzọ ma ọ bụ abụọ, eleghị anya.
Give it a few months or a year.	Nye ya ọnwa ole na ole ma ọ bụ otu afọ.
I would like to have a three-day weekend.	Ọ ga-amasị m inwe izu ụka ụbọchị atọ.
None of these are local men.	Ọ dịghị otú ndị a bụ ụmụ nwoke obodo.
You probably can't say it faster than once.	Eleghị anya ị nweghị ike ikwu ya ngwa ngwa karịa otu ugboro.
Power and substance.	Ike na ihe.
As a result.	N'ihi ya.

He wanted the event to give something to the community.	Ọ chọrọ ka ihe omume ahụ nye obodo ihe.
To me, that was cruel.	Nye m, nke ahụ bụ obi ọjọọ.

He wanted to be a doctor like his father.	Ọ chọrọ ịbụ dọkịta dị ka nna ya.
Suffering is my suffering is my suffering.	Ahụhụ bụ m ahụhụ bụ m ahụhụ.

Because every opportunity is within each of us.	N'ihi na ohere niile dị n'ime onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị.
Some of them are bad, but some are just hungry.	Ụfọdụ n’ime ha bụ ndị ọjọọ, ma ụfọdụ na-agụ naanị agụụ.

That’s just an idea, by the way.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị echiche, n'agbanyeghị.
They can tell you a lot about the community.	Ha nwere ike ịgwa gị ọtụtụ ihe gbasara obodo.

He went to the wrong place.	Ọ gara ebe na-adịghị mma.

He believed, so they believed.	O kwere, ya mere ha kwere.
This, however, did not frighten him.	Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị ihe ụjọ tụrụ ya.
You, mother, stay home.	Gị, nne nọrọ n'ụlọ.

Therefore, we can get these for all doctors.	Ya mere, anyị nwere ike nweta ndị a maka ndị dọkịta niile.
He got that very well.	O nwetara nke ahụ nke ọma.

He really liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
Does your father want to build his own house?	Nna gị chọrọ iwu ụlọ nke ya?

Last year was a kind of house year.	Afọ gara aga bụ ụdị afọ ụlọ.

They filled the place.	Ha juru ebe ahụ.
It would have been more important than you thought.	Ọ gaara adị mkpa karịa ka i chere.

None of these things can tell you at that time.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a pụrụ ịgwa gị n'oge ahụ.
It was a movie night.	Ọ bụ abalị ihe nkiri.
He obviously did not like it.	O doro anya na o nweghị mmasị.

But he does not want to say that.	Ma ọ chọghị ikwu otú ahụ.
No matter.	N'agbanyeghị ihe.

No one can do anything different.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ime ihe dị iche.
I think there could be more than that.	Echere m na enwere ike inwe ihe karịrị nke ahụ.

There are station staff.	E nwere ndị ọrụ ọdụ ụgbọ ahụ.
Looking for one of our people.	Na-achọ otu n'ime ndị anyị.

Where do you think the child can be?	Ebee ka ị chere nwa ahụ nwere ike ịnọ?

The policeman was not there.	Onye uwe ojii ahụ anọghị ebe ahụ.
This is the key.	Nke a bụ isi ihe niile.
You all know the story and the situation.	Unu niile mara akụkọ na ọnọdụ.
They will probably need that help.	Ma eleghị anya, enyemaka ahụ ga-adị ha mkpa.
And big too.	Na nnukwu kwa.
He was in the same plane.	Ọ nọ n'otu ụgbọ elu ahụ.
It's not bad.	Ọ naghị adị njọ.
This is obviously the way.	Nke a doro anya na ụzọ.
Not that.	Ọ bụghị na.
So we looked.	Ya mere, anyị lere anya.
But it's good.	Mana ọ dị mma.
For the third, it is the same.	Maka nke atọ, ọ bụ otu.

And others of them.	Na ndị ọzọ n'ime ha.
Many restaurants do it.	Ọtụtụ ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ na-eme ya.
Maybe there is another way to go.	Ma eleghị anya, e nwere ụzọ ọzọ na-abịa.
But this is still good.	Mana nke a ka dị mma.
I was sitting there trying to think.	M nọ ọdụ ebe ahụ na-agbalị iche echiche.

His face said he knew what was coming.	Ihu ihu ya kwuru na ọ ma ihe na-abịa.

There is another opportunity for the first time next week.	Enwere ohere ọzọ nke mbụ n'izu na-abịa.
For various reasons it is said that there is no value.	N'ihi ihe dị iche iche a na-ekwu na-enweghị uru.

It is a big room.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ọnụ ụlọ.
We love the word.	Anyị hụrụ okwu ahụ n'anya.

Hence, this practice is not the same.	N'ihi ya, omume a abụghị otu ihe.
Not many did.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ndị mere ya.
So let me give you an example.	Ya mere, ka m nye gị ihe atụ.

Awesome name indeed.	Dị egwu na aha n'ezie.

Some of you are afraid.	Ụjọ na-atụ ụfọdụ n'ime unu.
As in the past.	Dị ka oge ochie.
That made all these questions unnecessary.	Nke ahụ mere ka ajụjụ a niile ghara ịdị mkpa.
For example.	Dị ka ihe atụ.
I eat fish almost every day.	M na-eri azụ ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ kwa ụbọchị.
That makes me really excited to move on.	Nke ahụ na-eme m ezigbo obi ụtọ ịga n'ihu.

That was my grandmother next to my mother.	Nke ahụ bụ nne nne m n'akụkụ nne m.
My idea of ​​food can go anywhere.	Echiche m banyere nri nwere ike ịga ebe ọ bụla.

But again, and again.	Ma ọzọ, na ọzọ.

They talked about the weather.	Ha kwuru banyere ihu igwe.

Restaurants will be easy to find.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ ga-adị mfe ịchọta.

In the news.	Na ozi ọma.
It won't be long.	Ọ gaghị adị anya.
It works well.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
The station operator looked on.	Onye ọrụ ọdụ ụgbọ ahụ lere anya.
It was put in for a different reason.	E tinyere ya n'ihi ihe dị iche.
He does not run at all.	Ọ naghị agba ọsọ ma ọlị.
It will only be for.	Ọ ga-abụ naanị maka.
That is not more money than anyone else.	Nke ahụ abụghị ego karịa onye ọ bụla.
It requires a plan to do this.	Ọ chọrọ atụmatụ ime nke a.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t work.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ọ na-arụ ọrụ, mgbe ụfọdụ ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
We will continue with this plan until it is understood.	Anyị ga-aga n'ihu na atụmatụ a ruo mgbe ọ ghọtara ya.
I do not sleep.	Adịghị m ụra.
He knows me now.	Ọ ma m ugbu a.
Then he stopped.	Mgbe ahụ ọ kwụsịrị.

The point of the story is good.	Isi ihe dị na akụkọ ahụ dị mma.

He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
Just sit down.	Naanị nọdụ ala.
It took a long time.	O were ogologo oge.
They will not go very far.	Ha agaghị aga ebe dị anya.
We can have a room.	Anyị nwere ike ime ụlọ.
I saw the name but had nothing to think about.	Ahụrụ m aha ahụ mana ọ nweghị ihe m chere banyere ya.
It’s good to eat, but it doesn’t taste very good.	Ọ dị mma iri nri, ma ọ naghị atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
Help her feel better!	Nyere ya aka inwe mmetụta ka mma!
However, the point is the same.	Otú ọ dị, isi okwu bụ otu ihe ahụ.
None of these things.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a.
Proceed immediately.	Gaa n'ihu ozugbo.
To be, or not to be.	Ịbụ, ma ọ bụ ghara ịbụ.

Everything that happens to the man is bad.	Ihe ọ bụla na-eme n'isi nwoke ahụ adịghị mma.
Our dogs are always happy.	Nkịta anyị nwere obi ụtọ oge niile.
This is the story of a man doing that.	Nke a bụ akụkọ mmadụ na-eme nke ahụ.
Not a car accident.	Ọ bụghị ihe mberede ụgbọ ala.
Then comes the time to do the bowing.	Mgbe ahụ na-abịa oge ime ụta.
High place.	Ebe dị elu.
Hard to say.	O siri ike ikwu.
Those were difficult years.	Afọ ndị ahụ siri ya ike.
There are not many.	Enweghị ọtụtụ.
But this is not long.	Mana nke a abụghị ogologo oge.
It can be a big job for him.	O nwere ike ịbụ nnukwu ọrụ nye ya.
He has a chef.	O nwere onye isi nri.
There are many different types.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụdị ụdị dị iche iche.

You are talking about money and unity a little bit.	Ị na-ekwu maka ego na ịdị n'otu ntakịrị.
He knows very well.	Ọ maara nke ukwuu.
Because it happened before.	N'ihi na o mere na mbụ.
However, there are a few negative things about it.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ihe ole na ole na-adịghị mma banyere ya.
He heard it on the phone.	Ọ nụrụ ya na ekwentị.
What this person said is baseless.	Ihe onye a kwuru enweghị isi.
He started it.	Ọ malitere ya.
You may want to talk to their parents for a few minutes.	Ọ ga-amasị gị ịgwa ndị mụrụ ha okwu nkeji ole na ole.
You do not need to tell them.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ka ị gwa ha.
At that speed too.	Na ọsọ ahụ kwa.
In that case.	Na ikpe ahụ.
Of course, you can tell us a little bit about it.	N'ezie, ị nwere ike ịgwa anyị ntakịrị ihe gbasara ya.
I know some did.	Amaara m na ụfọdụ mere.
However, there are two things.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ihe abụọ.
That is the only problem.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị nsogbu.
These trips are hard work.	Njem njem ndị a bụ ọrụ siri ike.
I just want to see his face.	Naanị m chọrọ ịhụ ihu ya.
Some questions, though, require more than that.	Otú ọ dị, ajụjụ ụfọdụ chọrọ karịa nke ahụ.
There is work around it.	Enwere ọrụ gburugburu.
Because no one really knows what is going to happen to him.	N'ihi na ọ dịghị onye maara nke ọma ihe a ga-eme ya.
He went there.	Ọ gara ebe ahụ.
I'll go get them.	M ga-aga nweta ha.
It’s a great way to get a chance at awesome weather.	Ọ bụ ụzọ dị mma iji nweta ohere ihu igwe dị egwu.
This is real.	Nke a dị adị.
It can still happen.	Ọ ka nwere ike ime.
He looked at a picture of his father.	O lere anya na foto nna ya.
We both need to.	Anyị abụọ kwesịrị ime.
It’s just important.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe dị mkpa.
It came like this.	Ọ bịara dị ka nke a.
This may be one of the main reasons for this.	O nwere ike ịbụ otu ihe dị mkpa kpatara nke a.
They would have died, he would have lived.	Ha gaara anwụ, ọ ga-adị ndụ.
Soon, my friend was happy.	Obere oge, enyi m nwere obi ụtọ.
I found this funny, though.	Ahụrụ m nke a ọchị, n'agbanyeghị.
This is not my life.	Nke a abụghị ndụ m.
But there is no fear.	Mana egwu adịghị.
Customers seem to be happy.	Ndị ahịa yiri ka ọ na-enwe obi ụtọ.
They will do well.	Ha ga-eme nke ọma.

There was a dead baby in it.	E nwere nwa ọhụrụ dị ndụ na onye nwụrụ anwụ nọ n’ime ya.
But nothing else, too.	Ma ihe ọ bụla ọzọ, kwa.
It is a strong and unparalleled idea.	Ọ bụ echiche siri ike na-enweghị atụ.
The boat is now on the water.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ dị ugbu a na mmiri.
You are small.	Ị dị obere.
He is looking for a car.	Ọ na-achọ ụgbọ ala.
Most of them read only.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha na-agụ naanị.

They are so delicious.	Ha na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
However, he spoke harshly to her.	Otú ọ dị, ọ gwara ya okwu n'ụzọ dị egwu.
He thought he wanted the same thing he did.	O chere na ọ chọrọ otu ihe ahụ o mere.
So, let’s have a new year.	Ya mere, ka anyị nwee afọ ọhụrụ.
But he did it.	Ma o mere ya.
The machine seems to run very well.	Igwe ahụ dị ka ọ na-agba ọsọ nke ọma.

He wants to see it.	Ọ chọrọ ịhụ ya.
There is no problem with that.	Enweghị nsogbu na nke ahụ.
These words are simple, but not easy to say.	Okwu ndị a dị mfe, ma ọ dịghị mfe ikwu.
Imagine someone like you, but not you.	Were ya na onye dị ka gị, ma ọ bụghị gị.

Sometimes our customer is upset.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, onye ahịa anyị were iwe.

He entered.	Ọ banyere.

Each playground has a bar.	Ama egwuregwu egwuregwu ọ bụla nwere ebe a na-aṅụ ihe ọṅụṅụ.
He spoke the truth for two reasons.	O kwuru eziokwu n'ihi ihe abụọ.
Obviously not.	O doro anya na nke a agaghị adị otú ahụ.
But let’s assume it’s one time.	Ma, ka anyị were ya na ọ bụ otu oge.
That is very good.	Nke ahụ dị mma nke ukwuu.

That is my promise to you.	Nke ahụ bụ nkwa m kwere gị.
But it is very difficult.	Ma, o siri nnọọ ike.

If my girls were here, it wouldn't be so bad.	A sị na ụmụ agbọghọ m nọ ebe a, ọ gaghị adị njọ.
Morality is just that, morality.	Omume bụ naanị nke ahụ, omume.
The reason for the force.	Ihe kpatara ike.
The man he met.	Nwoke ahụ ọ zutere.
I am not a threat to anyone.	Abụghị m onye ọ bụla ihe egwu.
He understands now.	Ọ ghọtara ya ugbu a.
There is little reason for that.	Enwere obere ihe kpatara ya.
I just saw it.	Ahụrụ m nnọọ anya.
Sometimes you just wait to see your feelings.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ị na-eche naanị ka ị hụ mmetụta gị.
But you do not see the man's face in any of them.	Ma ị naghị ahụ ihu nwoke ahụ na nke ọ bụla n'ime ha.
Only then will she know that he really loves her.	Ọ bụ naanị mgbe ahụ ka ọ ga-esi mara na ọ hụrụ ya n’anya n’ezie.
The third time, it is done.	Nke ugboro atọ, a na-eme ya.
Some colleagues are willing to talk.	Ụfọdụ ndị ọrụ ibe ha dị njikere ikwu okwu.
A large house.	Otu nnukwu ụlọ.
But your mother is very strong.	Mana nne gị siri ezigbo ike.

The city has many old buildings.	Obodo ahụ nwere ọtụtụ ụlọ ochie.
Her smile was awkward.	Ọmụmụ ọnụ ọchị ya adịghị mma.

A lot of things will be awesome.	Ọtụtụ ihe ga-adị egwu.
No one was there.	O nweghị onye ebe ahụ.
He asked her.	Ọ jụrụ ya.
They don’t look like any good customers.	Ha adịghị ka ndị ahịa ọ bụla mara mma.
Seeing them every year brought me such relief.	Ịhụ ha kwa afọ mere ka ahụ́ ruo m ala otú ahụ.
The girl obviously hated him.	O doro anya na nwa agbọghọ ahụ kpọrọ ya asị.
Many different brands will require different things.	Ọtụtụ ụdị dị iche iche ga-achọ ihe dị iche iche.
There is a lot to do around here.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe a ga-eme gburugburu ebe a.

Logically, we cannot do so.	N'ụzọ ezi uche dị na ya, anyị enweghị ike ime otú ahụ.
I don’t want us to do that.	Achọghị m ka anyị ga-esi mee nke ahụ.

But we understand that there are doubts there.	Mana anyị ghọtara na enwere obi abụọ n'ebe ahụ.

Everything is still perfect.	Ihe niile ka zuru oke.
They made short talk during the drive, which soon stopped.	Ha na-ekwu obere okwu n'oge ụgbọala ahụ, nke kwụsịrị n'oge na-adịghị anya.
Please help us to help them.	Biko nyere anyị aka inyere ha aka.

Many people go to the capital every year.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-aga isi obodo kwa afọ.
It's a whole city.	Ọ bụ obodo niile.
I would never want to see that again.	Agaghị m achọ ịhụ nke ahụ ọzọ.

You will not weep over that.	Ị gaghị akwa ákwá ọ bụla banyere nke ahụ.
Although difficult.	N'agbanyeghị na ọ siri ike.
He needs my house.	Ọ chọrọ ụlọ m.
The daughter of this family was born.	A mụrụ nwa nwanyị ezinụlọ a.
He was satisfied with the game.	Egwuregwu egwuregwu juru ya afọ.
The rent is cheap.	Ụgwọ ụlọ ahụ dị ọnụ ala.
The city is famous for its historical films.	Obodo a ma ama maka ihe nkiri akụkọ ihe mere eme ya.
It seems to be.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị.
Sometimes it runs in families.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ na-agba na ezinụlọ.

There is fear in that.	Egwu dị na nke ahụ.

Good customer.	Ezigbo onye ahịa.

He promised to do his best.	O kwere nkwa ime ike ya.
Two main points should be noted here.	Ekwesịrị ịhụ isi ihe abụọ ebe a.
The film has a lot of hearts.	Ihe nkiri ahụ nwere ọtụtụ obi.
Tell me about this city.	Gwa m ihe gbasara obodo a.

For one thing, interest runs wild.	Otu ihe, mmasị na-agba ọsọ na ikpe.

The sea here is beautiful for swimming.	Oke osimiri ebe a mara mma maka igwu mmiri.

But that is the way it is with me.	Ma otú ahụ ka ọ dị m.

He is very busy.	O ji nnọọ ọrụ n'aka.
This is very beautiful.	Nke a mara mma nke ukwuu.
But we understood a little.	Mana anyị ghọtara ntakịrị.
He lives with his uncle and aunt.	Ya na nwanne nna ya na nwanne nne ya bi.
Thank you my son and daughter.	Daalụ nwa m nwoke na nwa m nwanyị.

The word is beyond it.	Okwu ahụ karịrị ya.
My grandmother was very angry.	Iwe were nne nne m nke ukwuu.
He was put in a cell.	E tinyere ya na ọnụ ụlọ mkpọrọ.

That is what he told her.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ gwara ya.

He shook his hand.	Ọ gbara aka ya.
As a woman with a plan.	Dị ka nwanyị nwere atụmatụ.
Maybe running on its own.	Ma eleghị anya, na-agba ọsọ n'onwe ya.
For his help around the house.	Maka enyemaka ya gburugburu ụlọ.
Can't find anyone to do that.	Enweghị ike ịhụ onye ga-eme nke ahụ.
He is very wise.	Ọ mara ihe nke ukwuu.
But he got home.	Ma o rutere n'ụlọ.
One police officer said the disease had started.	Otu onye uwe ojii kwuru na ọrịa malitere.
We have done nothing wrong.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọjọọ anyị mere.

A good house has many rooms.	Ezigbo ụlọ nwere ọtụtụ ọnụ ụlọ.
But he had an idea.	Ma o nwere echiche.

Here, it is everyone's own.	N'ebe a, ọ bụ onye ọ bụla nke ya.
His face was firm and fearful.	Ihu ya siri ike na egwu.

The restaurant is very nice, even though the rooms are small.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu, n'agbanyeghị na ọnụ ụlọ ndị ahụ dị ntakịrị.
For me, that would be a dead load.	Maka m, nke ahụ ga-abụ ibu nwụrụ anwụ.
But here we are, he said.	Ma ebe a anyị nọ, o kwuru.
It is his highest work.	Ọ bụ ọrụ ya kacha elu.
The car was stolen, but police did not find it.	E zuru ụgbọ ala a, ma ndị uwe ojii ahụghị.

So it was with my mother.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị nne m.
He has no plans to go anywhere.	O nweghị atụmatụ ịga ebe ọ bụla.
There is nothing better than a good night's sleep.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị mma karịa ezigbo ụra abalị.
The house is a big house.	Ụlọ ahụ bụ nnukwu ụlọ.

The team has no big job.	Ndị otu ahụ enweghị nnukwu ọrụ.
The letter arrived later that day.	Akwụkwọ ozi ahụ rutere n'azụ ụbọchị ahụ.

Then he had no choice.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ ga-eme ya.

The difference is that no action will occur in this story.	Ihe dị iche bụ na ọ nweghị omume agaghị eme na akụkọ a.

They go right where you indicated them.	Ha na-aga ozugbo ebe ị tụrụ ha aka.

So far, this is the only known information about them.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, nke a bụ naanị ozi a maara gbasara ha.

He got angry and left the meeting.	Iwe were ya wee pụọ ná nzukọ ahụ.

He can really do something.	O nwere ike ime ihe n'ezie.

But it doesn't work very well.	Ma ọ naghị arụ ezigbo ọrụ.
Any of this seems to be real.	Ihe ọ bụla nke a dị ka ọ dị adị.
But if you leave now, you will have nothing.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ị pụọ ugbu a, ị gaghị enwe ihe ọ bụla.

Everything will be better than this.	Ihe ọ bụla ga-adị mma karịa nke a.

For better or worse, we have to look for each other.	Maka mma ma ọ bụ njọ, anyị ga-achọ ibe anyị.
She looked at her boyfriend.	O lere enyi ya nwoke anya.

Of course he knows the difference.	N'ezie ọ maara ihe dị iche.

They could not find their way.	Ha enweghị ike ịchọta ụzọ ha.
Of course, you are the first one.	N'ezie, ị bụ onye mbụ.

So we did it for you.	Ya mere, anyị mere gị ya.
But it can't happen.	Mana o nweghị ike ime.
If you think about it, this is the only logical conclusion.	Ọ bụrụ na ị na-eche banyere ya, nke a bụ naanị ezi uche.
That was not the truth of his life.	Nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu nke ndụ ya.

For people like him, traveling is a daily occurrence.	Maka ndị dị ka ya, ime njem bụ ihe a na-eme kwa ụbọchị.

The fact is, though, that some will.	Otú ọ dị, nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na ụfọdụ ga-eme.

Of course he did not know.	N'ezie ọ maghị.

It's really something very different.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ihe dị nnọọ iche.

Apparently he is someone else.	O doro anya na ọ bụ onye ọzọ.
Or give to all three.	Ma ọ bụ nye ha atọ.

Afraid to do anything, afraid to do anything.	Na-atụ egwu ime ihe, na-atụ egwu ime ihe ọ bụla.

I didn’t feel alone when he walked into the room.	Ọ naghị adị m naanị mgbe ọ banyere n'ime ụlọ ahụ.

Probably because the others are not as good as they used to be.	Ma eleghị anya, n'ihi na ọ dịghị mma ka ndị ọzọ n'ime ha.

But now he has something to do.	Ma ugbu a, o nwere ihe ọ pụrụ ime.

The man was bad news.	Nwoke ahụ bụ akụkọ ọjọọ.
He said that he was well acquainted with the truth.	O kwuru na ya maara eziokwu ahụ nke ọma.

There is widespread perception and guilt.	Enwere echiche zuru ebe niile na ikpe mara ya.
That is because they are clearly not one person.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ihi na o doro anya na ha abụghị otu onye.
Suddenly, a fight broke out in the school.	Ngwa ngwa, ọgụ dara n'ụlọ akwụkwọ ahụ.

Feels low.	Na-eche na ọ dị ala.
He expected her to be.	Ọ tụrụ anya na ọ nọ.
However, it is a small story.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụ obere akụkọ.

This may be completely unreasonable.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ ezi uche zuru oke.

The stock price fell sharply.	Ọnụ ahịa ngwa ahịa ahụ dara nke ukwuu.

All of this feels like age.	Ihe a niile dị m ka afọ.

Some people say it's funny, but many people like it.	Ụfọdụ ndị na-ekwu na ọ bụ ihe ọchị, ma ọtụtụ ndị na-amasị ya.

He wondered what had happened to him.	Ọ nọ na-eche ihe mere ya.

Eventually, the violence subsided.	O mechara kwụsị ime ihe ike.
Of course, everyone liked it.	N'ezie, masịrị onye ọ bụla.

The girl is very beautiful.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
That is a simple idea.	Nke ahụ bụ echiche dị mfe.
And no money, by the way.	Na enweghị ego, n'agbanyeghị.
He has been in business for 20 years.	Ọ nọ n'ọrụ afọ iri abụọ.
The weight of his body.	Ibu ahụ ya.
The restaurant is not far away.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ ahụ adịghị anya.
He was happy to see her, he understood.	Obi adịghị ya ụtọ ịhụ ya, ọ ghọtara.
But something unusual happened next.	Ma, e nwere ihe pụrụ iche merenụ.
Maybe he doesn't like it.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ naghị amasị ya.
The ancients left nothing.	Ndị ochie ahụ hapụrụ ihe ọ bụla.
I spent a week there one night.	M nọrọ otu izu ebe ahụ otu abalị.
Can't do it well.	Enweghị ike ime ya nke ọma.

They are smart players.	Ha bụ ndị egwuregwu maara ihe.
But none of that.	Ma ọ dịghị nke.
Friendly city to be beautiful.	Obodo enyi ka ọ mara mma.
He came when he was feeling well.	Ọ bịara mgbe ọ dị ya mma.
He obviously has a history for the profession.	O doro anya na o nwere akụkọ ihe mere eme maka ọrụ ahụ.
He and I are here in this room.	Ya na anyị nọ ebe a n'ime ụlọ a.

There are a few more rooms on the right.	Enwere ụlọ ole na ole ọzọ n'aka nri.
If they know where you got the information from.	Ọ bụrụ na ha maara ebe ị nwetara ozi ahụ.
He left town.	Ọ hapụrụ obodo.
They do not use drugs.	Ha ejighị m ọgwụ ike.
Still, it is an event.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ bụ ihe omume.
Within the second week.	N'ime izu nke abụọ.

Only the important reader.	Naanị onye na-agụ ihe dị mkpa.
It does not suit me.	Ọ dịghị mma m.
Please see me alone.	Biko hụ m naanị.
This is my favorite.	Nke a bụ mmasị m.
The worst thing of my life.	Ihe kacha njọ nke ndụ m.
It is they who are in trouble.	Ọ bụ ha na-enwe nsogbu.
That is all.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị nke ahụ.
He started harassing me.	Ọ malitere inye m nsogbu.
Or there is a school trip.	Ma ọ bụ enwere njem ụlọ akwụkwọ.
It's in me.	Ọ dị n'ime m.
The boat in this one is very crowded.	Ụgbọ mmiri na nke a tụrụ mmadụ nke ukwuu.
It is a very difficult thing to do.	Ọ bụ ihe siri ike n'ezie ime.
We know how that is.	Anyị maara otú nke ahụ dị.
His father, a long time ago.	Nna ya, ogologo oge gara aga.
He spoke the truth.	O kwuru eziokwu ya.
My day job, some might call it.	Ọrụ ụbọchị m, ụfọdụ nwere ike ịkpọ ya.
It pleased the man.	Ọ tụrụ mma n’obi nwoke ahụ.
Not a good movie.	Ọ bụghị ihe nkiri dị mma.

Some soccer players work long hours every day.	Ụfọdụ ndị egwuregwu bọọlụ na-eme ọtụtụ awa kwa ụbọchị.
We are not like you.	Anyị adịghị ka gị.

You can be whoever you can be.	Ị nwere ike ịbụ onye ọ bụla ị nwere ike ịbụ.
Probably never did.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dịghị mgbe anyị mere.
He loved school.	Ọ hụrụ ụlọ akwụkwọ n'anya.
We love you and stay here for you.	Anyị hụrụ gị n'anya ma nọrọ ebe a maka gị.
I like it very much.	Enwere m mmasị nke ukwuu.
This is not an easy task.	Nke a abụghị ihe dị mfe.
Awesome idea.	Echiche dị egwu.
Over the past month.	N'ime ọnwa gara aga.
You see what he did to us.	Ị hụrụ ihe o mere anyị.
You are very beautiful.	Ị mara mma nke ukwuu.
He once believed that it did.	O kwere otu ugboro na o mere.
And then the third.	Na mgbe ahụ nke atọ.
He has a son, a daughter, and a good friend.	O nwere nwa nwoke, nwa nwanyị, na ezigbo enyi.
Let me help you with that.	Ka m nyere gị aka na nke ahụ.
All wines have alcohol.	Mmanya niile nwere mmanya.
You should do that when you can.	I kwesịrị ime nke ahụ mgbe ị nwere ike.
You know that will not happen.	Ị ma na nke ahụ agaghị eme.
Maybe he doesn't care.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ chọghị ịma.
But beautiful idea.	Mana echiche mara mma.
If sure then move on.	Ọ bụrụ n'aka wee gaa n'ihu.
It is still in our hands.	Ọ ka nọ n'aka anyị.
We can’t know it’s not good.	Anyị enweghị ike ịma na ọ dịghị mma.
Did he see me? 	Ọ hụrụ m?
he was surprised.	o juru ya anya.
He put me here.	O tinyere m ebe a.
The city is known for its books.	E ji akwụkwọ ya mara obodo a.
I do not like their behavior.	Omume ha adịghị amasị m.
I need something to do mentally.	Achọrọ m ihe iji mee uche.
There are two main reasons for this success.	Enwere isi ihe abụọ kpatara ihe ịga nke ọma ahụ.
Do you wear any special clothing?	Ị yi uwe ọ bụla pụrụ iche?
But of course there is a higher truth than that.	Mana n'ezie enwere eziokwu dị elu karịa nke ahụ.
I'm still about.	M ka banyere.
It comes from years of practice.	Ọ na-abịa site na omume ọtụtụ afọ.
Many of our examples are of this type.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ihe atụ anyị bụ ụdị a.
You know me a long time so I can believe them.	Ị mara m ogologo oge ka m wee kwere ha.
Stay there friend.	Nọrọ ebe ahụ enyi.
This is not the place to do that.	Nke a abụghị ebe ime nke ahụ.
They have been working on this problem for many years.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ na nsogbu a kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
But this is clearly not the case.	Ma nke a o doro anya na ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
Maybe it's a good thing to say.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ihe dị mma ikwu.
There is plenty of food in the country.	Enwere nri zuru oke na mba ahụ.
I play with this.	Ana m eji nke a egwu egwu.
She knew in that look that he had died.	Ọ ma na anya dị ya.
It's a good feeling.	Ọ bụ mmetụta dị mma inwe.
It doesn't have to be this way.	O kwesịghị ịdị otú ahụ.
His mother died when he was a child.	Nne ya nwụrụ mgbe ọ dị obere.
She expected a man.	Ọ tụrụ anya nwoke.
I do not want them.	Anaghị m achọ ha.
He looked around.	O lere anya gburugburu.
We need every gift.	Anyị chọrọ onyinye ọ bụla.
He is a happy baby.	Ọ bụ nwa ọhụrụ nwere obi ụtọ.
Three people died in the accident.	Mmadụ atọ nwụrụ n'ihe mberede a.
They do not know how to proceed.	Ha agaghị ama ka esi aga n'ihu.
It's up to me.	Ọ dị m n'aka.
I am looking for a boyfriend.	Ana m achọ enyi nwoke.
Not because of the awesome port.	Ọ bụghị n'ihi ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri dị egwu.
We can never do this again.	Anyị enweghị ike ime nke a ọzọ.
It is some kind of feast or something.	Ọ bụ ụfọdụ ụdị oriri ma ọ bụ ihe.
That's how money works.	Otú ahụ ka ego si arụ ọrụ.
He was behind and continues to play a little.	Ọ nọ n'azụ ma na-aga n'ihu na-egwu obere.
But that is not true.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
Like anything you want.	Dị ka ihe ọ bụla ị chọrọ.
It is them.	Ọ bụ ha.
No word.	Okwu adịghị.
The woman is afraid.	Ụjọ were nwanyị ahụ.
Or.	Ma ọ bụ .
He finished everything.	O mechara ihe niile.
I will be your journalist.	M ga-abụ onye nta akụkọ gị.
One way or another.	Otu ụzọ ma ọ bụ ọzọ.
Any questions?	Ajụjụ ọ bụla?
Of course it's second only to music.	N'ezie ọ bụ nke abụọ naanị egwu.
I cook and eat food every day.	Ana m esi nri na-eri nri kwa ụbọchị.
This is an old photo of just that.	Nke a bụ foto ochie nke naanị.
I immediately liked it.	Ọ masịrị m ozugbo.
He knows you well.	Ọ maara gị nke ọma.
I know her well.	Amaara m ya nke ọma.
It tastes really good.	Ọ na-atọ ezigbo ụtọ n'ezie.
He did not know the truth.	Ọ maghị nke bụ́ eziokwu.
I can't think very well.	Enweghị m ike iche echiche nke ọma.
They were doing things in his room.	Ha nọ na-eme ihe n'ime ụlọ ya.
That was more than a week ago.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe karịrị otu izu gara aga.
You like me tonight.	Ị na-amasị m n'abalị a.
You will do well.	Ị ga-eme nke ọma.
There is a crowd.	E nwere igwe mmadụ.
No room.	Ọ dịghị ụlọ.
He refused to leave.	Ọ jụrụ ịpụ.
He does it behind your back.	Ọ na-eme ya n'azụ gị.
And the only reason is judgment.	Na naanị ihe kpatara ya bụ ikpe.
Not a big deal.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu ihe.
It was all we had hoped for.	Ọ bụ ihe niile anyị tụrụ anya ya.
In other cases do whatever you like.	N'ime oge ndị ọzọ na-eme ihe ọ bụla masịrị gị.
Most likely public service.	O yikarịrị ka ọrụ obodo.
I am a fool.	Abụ m onye nzuzu.
Many cities have access to water.	Ọtụtụ obodo nwere ike nweta mmiri.
If only the money you need.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ naanị ego ị chọrọ.
You went home.	Ị gara n'ụlọ.
It's very kind.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ụdị.
Their work is fast.	Ọrụ ha dị ngwa ngwa.
It can be done again.	Enwere ike ime ya ọzọ.
I do not know where we are.	Amaghị m ebe anyị nọ.
He lives in the countryside.	O bi n'ime obodo.
However, he still had many weaknesses.	Otú ọ dị, ọ ka nwere ọtụtụ adịghị ike.
See it twice a day.	Hụrụ ya ugboro abụọ n'otu ụbọchị.
It's a beautiful idea.	Ọ bụ echiche mara mma.

I will go fast.	M ga-aga ngwa ngwa.
I'm glad you understood.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ị ghọtara ya.
It is never cold there.	Ọ dịghị mgbe oyi na-atụ n'ebe ahụ.
Very pretty girl.	Nwa agbọghọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
In his old house.	Na ụlọ ochie ya.
The staff loved it.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ hụrụ ya n'anya.
But it's just better.	Ma ọ bụ naanị mma.
He wants to.	Ọ chọrọ.
There are those who love us and care about us.	E nwere ndị hụrụ anyị n’anya ma na-eche banyere anyị.
It seems to exist.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị adị.
He was hungry, but not food.	Ọ na-agụ agụụ, mana ọ bụghị nri.
That may sound silly, but it's really worth it.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịdị ka ihe nzuzu, mana ọ bara ezigbo uru.
Not a perfect fast, though.	Ọ bụghị ngwa ngwa zuru oke, n'agbanyeghị.
They hated everything.	Ha kpọrọ ihe niile asị.
How to talk to her.	Otu esi agwa ya okwu.
The team is awesome.	Otu ahụ dị egwu.
He would not let me get it.	Ọ gaghị ekwe ka m nweta ya.
It's just.	Ọ dị nnọọ.
That would make more sense.	Nke ahụ ga-eme ka uche karịa.
But there you have it.	Ma e nwere gị.
Many of you are in this room I know.	Ọtụtụ n'ime unu nọ n'ime ụlọ a maara m.
Three, there are small questions in the industry.	Atọ, enwere obere ajụjụ na ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
No one else would.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ gaara ama.
How did he get this job?	Olee otú o si nweta ọrụ a?
I have a little over a month to go.	Enwere m ntakịrị ihe karịrị otu ọnwa ịga.
It's a big letter.	Ọ bụ nnukwu akwụkwọ ozi.
It is a logical idea.	Ọ bụ echiche ezi uche dị na ya.
I need a little time to get out.	Achọrọ m obere oge iji pụọ.
I looked around the bar.	M lere anya gburugburu ụlọ mmanya ahụ.
He will spend the weekend at the beach.	Ọ ga-anọ izu ụka n'akụkụ osimiri.
Because it happened.	N'ihi na o mere.
But he should know one way or another.	Ma ọ kwesịrị ịma otu ụzọ ma ọ bụ ọzọ.
That should really help.	Nke ahụ kwesịrị inye aka n'ezie.
But this is for a big reason.	Ma nke a bụ maka nnukwu ihe kpatara ya.
They went to his favorite place.	Ha gara ebe a na-amasị ya.
It does not seem to be a problem at all.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị nsogbu ịga n'ihu ugbu a.
The app for its application is perfect.	Ngwa ahụ maka ngwa ya zuru oke.
He reads a lot.	Ọ na-agụ ọtụtụ ihe.
I have no more.	Enweghị m ọzọ.
But so does the individual.	Ma otú ahụ ka onye ahụ dị n'otu n'otu.
Rie.	Rie.
It can have, by the way.	O nwere ike inwe, n'agbanyeghị.
Tom is looking for a new job.	Tom na-achọ ọrụ ọhụrụ.
It never will be.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-abụ.
These are not different from men.	Ndị a adịghị iche na nke ụmụ nwoke.
It runs very fast.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ nke ukwuu.
He can wait.	O nwere ike chere.
The subject of this water is not like water.	Ihe gbasara mmiri a adịghị ka mmiri.
It is near.	Ọ dị nso nso.
Our fear is our only fear.	Egwu anyị bụ naanị egwu anyị.
This is very clear.	Nke a doro anya nke ukwuu.
There is nothing beautiful about it.	Ọ nweghị ihe mara mma na ya.
What, if anything, is wrong?	Gịnị, ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla, adịghị mma?
Of course they are.	N'ezie ha bụ.
To be honest, he left a lot to be desired.	Iji gwa gị eziokwu, ọ hapụrụ ọtụtụ ihe.
For simple operation, everything can work fine.	Maka ọrụ dị mfe, ihe niile nwere ike na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
I want you all.	Achọrọ m gị ihe niile.
He put his energy, too.	O tinyere ike ya, kwa.
He wanted to do it himself.	Ọ chọrọ ime ya n'onwe ya.
But there are other factors that can contribute to your peace of mind.	Ma, e nwere ọtụtụ ihe ndị ọzọ nwere ike ime ka ahụ́ ruo gị ala.
I know.	Amaara m ihe.
Law is law.	Iwu bụ iwu.
I enjoy helping others find their own financial way.	Ọ na-amasị m inyere ndị ọzọ aka ịchọta ụzọ ego nke ha.
Beautiful music.	Egwu mara mma.
He has been in this situation for a long time.	Ọ nọ na ọnọdụ a ogologo oge.
I can see why some musicians are happy.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ihe kpatara na ụfọdụ ndị egwu na-enwe obi ụtọ.
He has a good wife and many children.	O nwere ezigbo nwunye na ọtụtụ ụmụ.
Either now or then.	Ma ọ bụ ugbu a ma ọ bụ mgbe.
He would not like it.	Ọ gaghị amasị ya.
There is no water, no life.	Enweghị mmiri, ọ dịghị ndụ.
You love this and want more.	Ị hụrụ nke a n'anya ma chọọ karịa.
You can go and come at any time.	Ị nwere ike ịga na-abịa n'oge ọ bụla.
Difficulties are very good.	Ihe isi ike dị ezigbo mma.
It's that simple.	Ọ dị mfe otú ahụ.
He always does good.	Ọ na-eme ihe ọma mgbe niile.
The city has something to enjoy.	Obodo ahụ nwere ihe na-atọ onye ọ bụla ụtọ.
I'm glad I have both of you.	Obi dị m ụtọ na m nwere unu abụọ.
She is suddenly very scared.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya na mberede.
We all have little to see.	Anyị niile nwere obere ịhụ ụzọ.
I had no idea there were such police forces.	Amaghị m na e nwere ndị uwe ojii dị otú ahụ.
The city needs good transportation.	Obodo chọrọ ezigbo ụgbọ njem.
She knows him better than he knows himself.	Ọ ma ya karịa ka ọ ma onwe ya.
Her eyes were wet.	Anya ya dị mmiri.
And you want what he wants.	Na ị chọrọ ihe ọ chọrọ.
He stole his bag.	O zuru akpa ya.

Of course no one can.	N'ezie ọ dịghị onye nwere ike.
Have a happy life and a happy time about it.	Nwee obi ụtọ ndụ na oge obi ụtọ banyere ya.
All children love toys.	Ụmụaka niile hụrụ ihe egwuregwu ụmụaka n'anya.
We will never do that again.	Anyị agaghị eme nke ahụ ọzọ.
He is not allowed to go abroad.	A naghị ekwe ka ọ gaa mba ọzọ.
I have them eating right.	Enwere m ha na-eri nri zuru oke.
I do not hear that.	Anaghị m anụ nke ahụ.

It doesn't have to be this way.	O kwesịghị ịdị otú ahụ.
These are really important.	Ndị a dị mkpa n'ezie.

I will do my best.	M ga-eme ike m niile.
How long will you go without water?	Ogologo oge ole ka ị ga-aga na-enweghị mmiri?
I love his company.	Enwere m mmasị na ụlọ ọrụ ya.
He is one of them.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ha.
It is four weeks.	Ọ bụ izu anọ.
It is expensive.	Ọ dị oke ọnụ.
Just wait for it.	Naanị ị chere ya.
That is the idea.	Nke ahụ bụ echiche.
He left me this.	Ọ hapụrụ m ihe a.
I have a little emotion.	Enwere m ntakịrị mmetụta uche.
I hope it makes you smile a little.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ ga-eme gị ntakịrị ọnụ ọchị.
I do not know.	Amaghị ya.
He and I walked a long way back.	Mụ na ya na-aga azụ ogologo ụzọ.
The reason is money.	Ihe kpatara ya bụ ego.
For one, it is impossible.	Maka otu, ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
No 'fast.	Mba' ngwa ngwa.
It’s not just a plan of action.	Ọ bụghị naanị atụmatụ ime ihe.
Here, every child needs everyone’s way.	N'ebe a, nwa ọ bụla chọrọ ụzọ onye ọ bụla.
No one knows much about it.	Ọ dịghị onye maara nke ukwuu banyere ya.
One thought surprised him.	Otu echiche tụrụ ya n'anya.
As you can see, this is a big house.	Dị ka ị pụrụ ịhụ, nke a bụ nnukwu ụlọ.
Their eyes met.	Anya ha zutere.
The girl is my sister.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ bụ nwanne m nwanyị.
For some reason it does not work.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
Of course, that is not true.	N'ezie, nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
These problems are due to overheating.	Nsogbu ndị a bụ n'ihi oke okpomọkụ.
He came to see me today.	Ọ bịara ịhụ m taa.
I think it would be nice to tell my friend.	Echere m na ịgwa enyi m ga-adị mma.
It is for every company.	Ọ bụ maka ụlọ ọrụ ọ bụla.
Their journey is difficult.	Njem ha siri ike.
It is a perfect land.	Ọ bụ ala zuru oke.
But that doesn't matter.	Ma nke ahụ adịghị mkpa.
They will be.	Ha ga-abụ.
The car suddenly stopped.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ kwụsịrị na mberede.
Dogs are good friends.	Nkịta bụ ezigbo enyi mmadụ.
You are a father.	Ị bụ nna.
Everywhere.	Na ebe niile.
He was so intoxicated that he could not speak.	Mmanya riri ya nke ukwuu nke na o nweghị ike ikwu okwu.
It was two other people.	Ọ bụ mmadụ abụọ ọzọ.
You are important.	Ị dị mkpa.
Everyone knows him there.	Onye ọ bụla maara ya ebe ahụ.
Children do this often.	Ụmụaka na-eme nke ahụ ọtụtụ oge.
He knows he is not alone.	Ọ ma na ọ bụghị naanị ya.
He stared at the small object for several minutes.	O lere obere ihe ahụ anya ruo ọtụtụ nkeji.
It's really fast.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ngwa ngwa.
Those people seem to be working.	Ndị ahụ yiri ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
As a result, the case is different.	N'ihi nke a, ikpe ahụ dị iche.
All three of us.	Anyị niile atọ.
I would like a long vacation.	Aga m achọ ogologo ezumike.
What an awesome experience.	Kedu ihe dị egwu.
But that’s a little bit.	Ma nke ahụ dị ntakịrị.
My daughter's life.	Ndụ nwa m nwanyị.
The effect is minimal.	Mmetụta dị ntakịrị.
He liked courage and honesty.	Obi ike na ikwu eziokwu masịrị ya.
But sometimes things come up.	Ma mgbe ụfọdụ ihe na-abịa.
More than that, there are many.	Karịa nke ahụ, e nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
He met her.	O zutere ya.
I think the same, too.	Echere m otu ahụ, kwa.
It's too bad, of course.	Ọ dị oke njọ, n'ezie.
There are people everywhere.	Enwere ndị mmadụ n'ebe niile.
Some people do, but some don't.	Ụfọdụ ndị na-eme, ma ụfọdụ anaghị eme ya.
What can we do about this?	Gịnị ka anyị nwere ike ime banyere nke a?
What works for some people may not work for others.	Ihe na-arụ ọrụ maka ụfọdụ ndị nwere ike ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ maka ndị ọzọ.
Worst of all.	Nke kacha njọ.
I went to see him.	M gara hụ ya.
Everyone who saw it was amazed.	O juru onye ọ bụla hụrụ ya anya.
He had an idea.	O nwere echiche.
Thanks again for the good work.	Daalụ ọzọ maka ezi ọrụ ahụ.
But, of course, they did.	Ma, n'ezie, ha mere.
So this is the challenge.	Ya mere, ihe ịma aka bụ nke a.
It is not wanted.	Achọghị ya.
Not my test.	Ọ bụghị ule m.
Hard time, of course.	Oge siri ike, n'ezie.
I think we played well enough to get there.	Echere m na anyị gbara bọọlụ nke ọma ruo ebe ahụ.
Everyone was moving on with his life.	Onye ọ bụla nọ na-aga n'ihu na ndụ ya.
And your boss, the boss.	Na onye isi gị, onye isi.
For that, it is a closed question.	Maka nke ahụ, ọ bụ ajụjụ kwụsịrị.
Everyone has the right to be suspicious of others.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ikike enyo ndị ọzọ enyo.
We are more truthful.	Anyị na-ekwu eziokwu karịa.
Like their parents.	Dị ka ndị mụrụ ha.
It seems simple.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị mfe.
It's very stupid.	Ọ bụ nnọọ nzuzu.
About this, he is sure.	Banyere nke a, o ji n'aka.
The worst it can do.	Nke kacha njọ ọ nwere ike ime.
This rain comes in the morning.	Mmiri a na-abịa na ụtụtụ.
We thought we did.	Anyị chere na anyị na-eme.
You can get your food in one minute.	Ị nwere ike nweta nri gị n'otu nkeji.

They were very beautiful when they were young.	Ha mara mma nke ukwuu mgbe ha dị obere.

He was there.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ.
It would be nice if I could rest.	Ọ gaara adị mma ka m zuru ike.
He is not the only one who speaks.	Ọ bụghị naanị na ọ na-ekwu okwu.
But it has a different effect.	Ma o nwere mmetụta dị iche.
The room has no lights.	Ime ụlọ ahụ enweghị ọkụ.

You can get three all the time.	Ị nwere ike nweta atọ mgbe niile.
How long have they left.	Ogologo oge ole ka ha hapụrụ.
She is scared.	Ụjọ juru ya n’obi.
Everything is fine, and where it should be.	Ihe niile dị mma, na ebe ọ kwesịrị ịdị.
Not the weather.	Ọ bụghị ihu igwe.

Otherwise, you are in trouble.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ị nọ na nsogbu.
I want people to know that we love this.	Achọrọ m ka ndị mmadụ mara na anyị hụrụ nke a n'anya.
He dances fast and fast.	Ọ na-agba egwu ọsọ ọsọ na ngwa ngwa.
This is what it really is.	Nke a bụ ihe ya n'ezie.
A second child was born in the winter.	A mụrụ nwa nke abụọ n'oge oyi.
A woman is behind him.	Nwanyị nọ n'azụ ya.
It is early in the morning and cold.	Ọ bụ n'isi ụtụtụ na oyi.

This is a difficult question.	Nke a bụ ajụjụ siri ike.
But that may be easier said than done.	Ma nke ahụ nwere ike ịdị mfe ikwu karịa ime.
But there is something wrong with any form.	Mana enwere ihe na-adịghị mma na ụdị ọ bụla.
That is my life.	Nke ahụ bụ ndụ m.
At the time, it was very new and different.	N'oge ahụ, ọ bụ nnọọ ọhụrụ na dị iche.
In fact, he seems to be a perfect man.	N'ezie, ọ dị ka onye zuru oke.
She expects to play it safe.	Ọ na-atụ anya egwu egwu ya.
Because we really care about each other.	Ọ bụ n’ihi na anyị na-eche nnọọ banyere ibe anyị.
Some of his friends did not.	Ụfọdụ ndị enyi ya emeghị.
They do not want to see anyone.	Ha achọghị ịhụ onye ọ bụla.
That doesn’t make it better or worse.	Nke ahụ anaghị eme ka ọ dị mma ma ọ bụ ka njọ.
If it can be of any help.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ nwere ike ịbụ enyemaka ọ bụla.
But believe me it's not funny.	Ma kwere m na ọ bụghị ihe ọchị.
It is perfect.	O zuru oke.
During that year, something happened.	N'ime afọ ahụ, ihe mere.
Working with children.	Na-arụ ọrụ na ụmụaka.
It does not like many families.	Ọ dịghị amasị ọtụtụ ezinụlọ.
Our house is on fire.	Ụlọ anyị na-agba ọkụ.

This message was successful.	Ozi a gara nke ọma.
Not so, for two reasons.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ, n'ihi ihe abụọ.
If he is alive.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị ndụ.
The mother knows that the time is coming.	Nne ahụ ma na oge na-abịa.
He says it is for the better.	Ọ na-ekwu na ọ bụ maka mma.
He has a name.	O nwere aha.
I looked around.	M lere anya gburugburu.

That would be ridiculous.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ihe ọchị.
But, he said, there is something else.	Ma, o kwuru, e nwere ihe ọzọ.
He did not know how to do that.	Ọ maghị otú ọ ga-esi eme eziokwu ahụ.
They can do more in life.	Ha nwere ike ime ihe ọzọ na ndụ.

Stay in place two or three at a time.	Nọ n'ebe abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ n'otu oge.

He felt it was not his.	O nwere mmetụta na ọ bụghị nke ya.

Nothing is there until everything is there.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị n'ebe ahụ ruo mgbe ihe niile dị.
But this should not be the case.	Ma nke a ekwesịghị ịdị otú ahụ.
The river provided the first machines.	Mmiri osimiri nyere igwe ndị mbụ.
Tomorrow is a big day.	Echi bụ nnukwu ụbọchị.

Maybe they condemned him anyway.	Ma eleghị anya, ha mara ya ikpe n'agbanyeghị.

For me, I enjoy my work.	Maka m, ọrụ m na-atọ m ụtọ.

We can really know things.	Anyị nwere ike ịma ihe n'ezie.
There are a few more requirements.	Enwere ihe ole na ole ọzọ achọrọ.
He never told anyone what had happened.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ gwara onye ọ bụla ihe ahụ merenụ.
There is good promise there.	E nwere ezigbo nkwa n’ebe ahụ.
Success is not the cause.	Ihe ịga nke ọma abụghị ihe kpatara ya.
Probably not immediately, but soon.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị ozugbo, ma n'oge na-adịghị.
They looked at each other.	Ha lere ibe ha anya n’obi.
I love it, but it is not strong.	M hụrụ ya n'anya, ma ọ dịghị ike.
I'm not interested at this time.	Enweghị m mmasị n'oge a.
Money is one, one, one.	Ego bụ otu, onye, ​​otu.
I know what is true.	Amaara m ihe bụ eziokwu.
We have some questions.	Anyị nwere ajụjụ ụfọdụ.
Many people go abroad for vacation.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-aga mba ọzọ maka ezumike.
You have to do both.	Ị ga-eme ha abụọ.
There are no known side effects.	Enweghị mmetụta ọ bụla amaara ama.

He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
There are some problems.	Enwere nsogbu ụfọdụ.
His power seems to be limited.	O yiri ka ike ya dị obere.
We never asked her her price.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị jụrụ ya ọnụ ahịa ya.
I hear demons.	Ana m anụ ndị mmụọ ọjọọ.
He wonders how many more people are ahead.	Ọ nọ na-eche mmadụ ole ọzọ nọ n'ihu.
Everything else will go.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ ga-aga.
And not just here.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị ebe a.
The friend is in need.	Enyi ahụ nọ na mkpa.
It is a real force in itself.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ike n'onwe ya.
These are just ideas.	Ndị a bụ naanị echiche.
He refused and told her to leave.	Ọ jụrụ ma gwa ya ka ọ pụọ.
He wants this.	Ọ chọrọ ihe a.
I just thought it was funny.	M nnọọ chere na ọ bụ ihe ọchị.
She is sad.	Obi adịghị ya mma.
It's all in place.	Ọ bụ ihe niile na ebe.
I will make it smaller.	M ga-eme ka ọ dị obere.
But it is not like everyone else is doing anything in character.	Ma ọ dịghị ka onye ọ bụla ọzọ na-eme ihe ọ bụla na agwa.
All of this is new.	Ihe a niile dị ọhụrụ.
The river drains the water.	Osimiri na-agba ala mmiri.
So you are angry.	Ya mere iwe were gị.
They know everything there is, everyone.	Ha maara ihe niile dị, onye ọ bụla.
We wonder why, until now.	Anyị na-eche ihe kpatara ya, ruo ugbu a.

I don't want to be anywhere near you.	Achọghị m ịnọ ebe ọ bụla nso gị.
But of course it is difficult now.	Mana n'ezie ọ siri ike ugbu a.
He hated the man immediately.	Ọ kpọrọ nwoke ahụ asị ozugbo ahụ.
It's a beautiful machine.	Ọ bụ igwe mara mma.
There is only one problem.	Enwere naanị otu nsogbu.
Today it is different.	Taa ọ dị iche.

With pleasure now, this should no longer be the case.	Ebe ihe ụtọ dị ugbu a, nke a ekwesịghị ịbụ eziokwu ọzọ.

But we are what we are.	Ma anyị bụ ihe anyị bụ.

But that seems to be a lie.	Ma ọ dị ka ọ bụ ụgha.
That is high.	Nke ahụ dị elu.

This time, he was a side runner.	N'oge a, ọ bụ onye na-agba ọsọ n'akụkụ.
But every man is different.	Ma nwoke ọ bụla dị iche.
All day they were swimming and playing.	Ụbọchị niile ha na-egwu mmiri ma na-egwu egwu.

Her story is very interesting.	Akụkọ ya na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
Those things are special.	Ihe ndị ahụ pụrụ iche.
You and your boyfriend will never be the same.	Gị na enyi gị nwoke agaghị abụ otu.
You need to do it again and again.	Ị chọrọ ime ya ugboro ugboro.
For others, it may tell you what you thought of the past.	Nye ndị ọzọ, ọ nwere ike ịgwa gị ihe ị chere na mbụ.
It started this way.	Ọ malitere n'ụzọ a.
He refused to talk about it.	Ọ jụrụ ikwu banyere ya.
So, to our surprise, we were really happy.	Ya mere, ọ tụrụ anyị n'anya na, n'ezie, obi dị anyị ụtọ.
Tears welled up in his eyes.	Anya mmiri gbara ya n'ihu.

He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
Everyone needs a car today!	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ ụgbọ ala taa!
It is difficult to say so.	O siri ike ikwu otú ahụ.

But you know what people say.	Ma ị ma ihe ndị mmadụ na-ekwu.
He certainly loves her.	N'ezie, ọ hụrụ ya n'anya.

When possible, it is best to use your own photos, good photos.	Mgbe enwere ike, ọ ka mma iji foto nke gị, ezigbo foto.

You can not do better than that.	Ị nweghị ike ime nke ọma karịa nke ahụ.

He is still in the hospital room.	Ọ ka nọ n'ọnụ ụlọ ụlọ ọgwụ.

Such work cannot exist.	Ọrụ dị otú ahụ enweghị ike ịdị.

You are welcome.	Ọ dị gị mma.

But again it surprised me.	Ma ọzọ ọ tụrụ m n'anya.

You could ask your parents for help.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa ndị mụrụ gị ka ha gwa gị ihe ndị ọzọ.
Are you hungry?	Agụụ ọ na-agụ gị?
He gave another command, because it was right.	O nyere iwu ọzọ, n'ihi na ọ dị mma.
He nodded.	O kwere isi.
The event was a success.	Ihe omume ahụ gara nke ọma.
But they are not like anything.	Ma ha adịghị ka ihe ọ bụla.
As he does not want to say.	Dị ka ọ chọghị ikwu.
We were told that the police were on their way.	A gwara anyị na ndị uwe ojii na-aga.

He wants to be here with his mother.	Ọ chọrọ ka ya na nne ya nọrọ ebe a.
Can you help me with my homework?	Ị nwere ike inyere m aka n'ọrụ ụlọ m?
But that is the simplest situation.	Mana nke ahụ bụ ọnọdụ kacha mfe.
His work lasted several weeks.	Ọrụ ya nọrọ m ọtụtụ izu.
But there is nothing we can do.	Mana ọ nweghị ihe anyị nwere ike ime.
But not now, not like this.	Ma ọ bụghị ugbu a, ọ bụghị dị ka nke a.

Perfection in that.	Izu oke na nke ahụ.

They were given fresh food and water.	E nyere ha nri na mmiri ọhụrụ.
Of course, there are limitations in this study.	N'ezie, enwere oke dị n'ime ọmụmụ ihe a.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị mma na ya.
A man drinking water.	Otu nwoke na-aṅụ mmiri.

It does not need to be available, it does not need to be deserved.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ka e nweta ya, ọ dịghị mkpa ka e kwesịrị ya.
Now all we have is time, money, and space.	Ugbu a naanị ihe anyị nwere bụ oge, ego, na ohere.
There are perhaps two main reasons.	Ma eleghị anya, e nwere isi ihe abụọ kpatara ya.
I do not see it.	Anaghị m ahụ ya.
It is for the community.	Ọ bụ maka obodo.
I like getting people.	Ọ na-amasị m ị nweta ndị mmadụ.
And because some of his work is better then he knows.	Na n'ihi na ụfọdụ ọrụ ya ka mma mgbe ahụ ọ maara.

Of course, you know better than that.	N'ezie, ị maara nke ọma karịa nke ahụ.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị njọ.
As soon as we can, we will get out of here.	Ozugbo anyị nwere ike, anyị ga-esi ebe a pụọ.

For some reason something like the last hour.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ nke yiri awa awa gara aga.

This is an important point.	Nke a bụ isi ihe dị mkpa.

I do not want to know who you are or where you come from.	Achọghị m ịma onye ị bụ ma ọ bụ ebe i si bịa.
They do not want this.	Ha achọghị nke a.
But he had a second opinion.	Ma o nwere echiche nke abụọ.
They eat it.	Ha na-eri ya.
The house has a day.	Ụlọ ahụ nwere ụbọchị.
This road has trees on both sides.	Ụzọ a nwere osisi n'akụkụ abụọ.

This is indeed a sight to behold.	Nke a bụ n'ezie ihe a hụrụ.
Children are on every side.	Ụmụaka nọ n'akụkụ ọ bụla.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	O yiri iwe.
I do not know the man in the robe.	Amaghị m nwoke ahụ yi uwe.
But most of the time, things are not as they seem.	Ma ọtụtụ mgbe, ihe adịghị adị ka ha dị.
Probably never.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-abụ.
It is very different.	Ọ dị nnọọ iche.
He hated the idea.	Ọ kpọrọ echiche ahụ asị.
I feel a sense of responsibility that comes with that.	Enwere m mmetụta ibu ọrụ na-abịa na nke ahụ.

Only courts have this right.	Naanị ụlọ ikpe nwere ikike a.

A man was called to the prison.	E kpọrọ otu nwoke n’ụlọ mkpọrọ.

The man died, not my father.	Nwoke ahụ nwụrụ, ọ bụghị nna m.
I was shocked.	O juru m ọnụ.
There is no fighting for it.	Ọ dịghị ọgụ maka ya.
The ancient city was packed to the brim.	Obodo oge ochie juru n'ọnụ ruo n'ọnụ.
He does this for everyone.	Ọ na-eme onye ọ bụla ihe a.

For us, each holiday is unique.	Maka anyị, ezumike ọ bụla pụrụ iche.
Not everyone does that.	Ọ bụghị mmadụ niile na-eme otú ahụ.
He will not be there for long.	Ọ gaghị anọ ebe ahụ ka mụ na ya nọrọ ogologo oge.
The children love it.	Ụmụaka hụrụ ya n'anya.
He stopped eating.	Ọ kwụsịrị iri nri.
You must arrive at the airport on time.	Ị ga-aga ọdụ ụgbọ elu n'oge.

Some are true and some are false.	Ụfọdụ bụ eziokwu ma ụfọdụ bụ ụgha.
They did not, obviously.	Ha emeghị, o doro anya.
We may not hear them, but we know they are.	Anyị nwere ike ọ gaghị anụ ha, ma anyị maara na ha dị.
But he likes the effect on her skin.	Ma mmetụta ya na akpụkpọ ahụ ya na-amasị ya.
That’s what you do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ị na-eme.
But tell your mother.	Ma gwa nne gị.
However, that is an idea.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ bụ echiche.
And everyone wants that feeling.	Na onye ọ bụla chọrọ mmetụta ahụ.
Then they started talking.	Mgbe ahụ, ha malitere ikwu okwu.
It's like running.	Ọ dị ka ịgba ọsọ.
Now you are a man.	Ugbu a ị bụ nwoke.
She is a free woman.	Ọ bụ nwanyị nwere onwe ya.
There is no such authority.	Enweghị ikike dị otú ahụ.

Some children left school early this morning.	Ụfọdụ ụmụaka hapụrụ ụlọ akwụkwọ n'isi ụtụtụ taa.
Of course always.	N'ezie mgbe niile.

He actually spoke for almost an hour.	O kwuru okwu n'ezie ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ otu awa.
I would like nothing more than to have something.	Ọ dịghị ihe ga-amasị m karịa inwe ihe.
They need you when they need you.	Ha chọrọ gị mgbe ha chọrọ gị.
I don’t know why, myself.	Amaghị m ihe kpatara ya, onwe m.
Wait for it to leave.	Chere ka ọ pụọ.
Worse than that.	Ihe ọjọọ karịa.
You can have this, man.	Ị nwere ike inwe otu a, nwoke.

You want them to be healthy.	Ị chọrọ ka ahụ dị ha mma.
When we first met, he was very upset.	Mgbe mbụ anyị zutere, iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
But it doesn’t work the other way around.	Mana ọ naghị arụ ọrụ n'ụzọ ọzọ.
Did anyone see it?	Ọ dị onye hụrụ ya?
Now is your vacation.	Ugbu a ọ bụ gị oge izu ike.
You are just my best friend.	Ị bụ naanị ezigbo enyi m.
He ate them.	Ya rie ha.

No need for further testing.	Ọ dịghị mkpa maka ule ọzọ.
A similar situation exists here.	Ọnọdụ yiri ya dị ebe a.

In a hurry, he had no.	N'ime ngwa ngwa, ọ nweghị.

Still, it was hard to go.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ siri ike ịga.
Well done here.	Ọ dị mma ebe a.
I'm still in it.	M ka nọ na ya.
He was on his way.	Ọ nọ na-aga.
But they feel that something is missing.	Ma ha chere na ọ dị ihe dị na ya.
He gave her her desires and needs.	O nyere ya agụụ ya na mkpa ya.
The problem is that they do not exist.	Nsogbu bụ na ha anaghị adị.
They thought that was it.	Ha chere na ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka o mere.
Now he knows what it is.	Ugbu a, ọ maara ihe ọ bụ.
The body is in the back.	Ahụ ahụ nọrọ n'azụ.
It's really good.	Ọ dị mma n'ezie.
Do you like this dress?	akwa a ọ masịrị gị?
But this is a surprise.	Mana nke a bụ anya.
All groups are different and different.	Otu niile dị iche na iche.

The other day, nothing was better.	Ụbọchị ndị ọzọ, ọ dịghị ihe dị mma.
And he spoke to me.	O wee gwa m okwu.
The fish is delicious.	Azụ na-atọ ụtọ.
However, it is good.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dị mma.
These facts are not interesting here.	Eziokwu ndị a enweghị mmasị n'ebe a.
His anger blazed!	Iwe ya tụrụ ọkụ!
I'd like to do that again.	Ọ ga-amasị m ime nke ahụ ọzọ.

Something is wrong here.	Ọ nwere ihe adịghị mma ebe a.

It's actually a bigger problem than you think.	Ọ bụ n'ezie nsogbu ka ukwuu karịa ka ị chere.
Strong quality and quality.	Ụdị siri ike na ịdị mma.

It doesn’t work, for another.	Ọ naghị arụ ọrụ, maka ọzọ.

Women have no place.	Ụmụ nwanyị enweghị ebe.
He had no choice but to tell the truth.	O nweghị ihe ọzọ ọ ga-eme ma ọ́ bụghị ịgwa ya eziokwu.
Of course, that makes it happen.	N'ezie, nke ahụ na-eme ka ọ mee.
Great power, of course.	Ike dị ukwuu, n'ezie.

In fact, it brought him peace of mind.	N'ezie, o mere ka obi ruo ya ala.

This is very clear.	Nke a doro nnọọ anya.
He was very handsome, but younger than his age.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu, ma dị obere karịa afọ ya.
His friends admired his beauty.	Ndị enyi ya nwere mmasị na ịma mma ya.

Most jobs may not work.	Ọtụtụ ọrụ nwere ike ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ.

We have everything we need, you know.	Anyị nwere ihe niile anyị chọrọ, ị mara.
Of course he would not allow it.	N'ezie ọ gaghị ekwe ka ya.
But that is how it works.	Mana otu ahụ ka ọ na-arụ.
She lives alone in a big house.	O bi naanị ya n’otu nnukwu ụlọ.
There is nowhere to go.	Enweghị ebe ị ga-aga.
Or it happened at the same time.	Ma ọ bụ o mere n'otu oge ahụ.
It’s about as little as he has.	Ọ bụ ihe dị ka obere ihe o nwere.
I just know it can be hard sometimes.	M nnọọ maara na ọ ga-esi ike mgbe ụfọdụ.
That is not good for everyone.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma maka onye ọ bụla.
It has a very negative effect.	Ọ nwere ezigbo mmetụta ọjọọ.
The chef is known for his beautiful chef.	A maara onye isi nri maka isi nri ya mara mma.
He is sitting there.	Ọ nọ ọdụ n'ebe ahụ.

These shoes work well for the first two months.	Akpụkpọ ụkwụ ndị a na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma maka ọnwa abụọ mbụ.
It doesn't seem to matter.	Ọ dị ka ọ dịghị mkpa.

A little bit sweet.	Ụdị obere ihe dị ụtọ.
Have lots of it.	Nwee ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
Suddenly, something happened.	Na mberede, otu ihe dara ya.
This may be true, but it may not be.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ eziokwu, ma ọ nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ.
They know that there is something we need to do now.	Ha ma na ọ dị ihe anyị kwesịrị ime banyere ya ugbu a.
He has been doing that work ever since.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ ahụ kemgbe ahụ.
I think the story may have been a little more dramatic.	Echere m na akụkọ ahụ nwere ike ọ dị ntakịrị karịa.
Others fear him.	Ndị ọzọ na-atụ ya egwu.
It was our parents' favorite song.	Ọ bụ abụ kacha amasị ndị mụrụ anyị.
Then he stopped again.	Mgbe ahụ ọ kwụsịrị ọzọ.
They just look so good.	Ha dị nnọọ ka ọ dị mma.
Hopefully, it will remain the same.	Olileanya, ọ ga-anọ otu ahụ.
The gift came by boat.	Onyinye ahụ ji ụgbọ mmiri bịa.

I need to talk.	Ekwesịrị m ikwu okwu.
The movie is about to happen.	Ihe nkiri ahụ na-aga ime.
Maybe that's fine.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ dị mma.
It was a small thing that made it go.	Ọ bụ obere ihe mere ka ọ na-aga.
Someone wise.	Mmadụ mara ihe.
Thoughts and work.	Echiche na ọrụ.
Or.	Ma ọ bụ.
There is nothing wrong with it, if you have it once in a while.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị njọ na ya, ma ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ya otu ugboro n'oge.
He spent the night with many patients.	Ọ nọrọ n'abalị ahụ na ọtụtụ ndị ọrịa.
They are afraid of the police.	Ha na-atụ ndị uwe ojii egwu.
I speak only.	M na-ekwu okwu naanị.
You took a chance.	I were ohere.
No, not cold, he understood.	Mba, ọ bụghị oyi, ọ ghọtara.
I told you that before.	Agwara m gị nke ahụ na mbụ.
For me.	Maka m.
However, things are not easy today.	Otú ọ dị, ihe adịghị mfe taa.
More stories, more stories.	Akụkọ ndị ọzọ, akụkọ ndị ọzọ.
Bad for him.	Ihe ọjọọ maka ya.
I know this very well.	Amaara m nke ọma.
And sometimes work.	Na ụfọdụ oge na-arụ ọrụ.
It's not very good.	Ọ dịghị mma nke ukwuu.
Still, it is not.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ bụghị ya.
The next day.	N'oge echi.
No doubt he was amazed.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na ọ juru.
Maybe that's not a bad thing at all.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ abụghị ihe ọjọọ.
Hopefully it's just me.	Olileanya na ọ bụ naanị m.
Drugs do not make me comfortable.	Ọgwụ anaghị eme ka ahụ́ ruo m ala.
The trees there are beautiful and ancient.	Osisi ndị dị n'ebe ahụ mara mma na oge ochie.
You know that he told us the truth.	Ị ma na ọ gwara anyị eziokwu.
So you do it.	Ya mere, ị na-eme ya.
It's his favorite song.	Ọ bụ egwu kacha amasị ya.
I can't say anything or anything.	Enweghị m ike ikwu okwu ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
I really think this will help.	Echere m n'ezie na nke a ga-enyere aka.
A leader who truly cares about his people.	Onye isi ala nke na-eche banyere ndị ya n'ezie.
Take my word for it.	Were okwu m maka ya.
It will happen soon.	Ọ ga-eme ọsọ ọsọ.
It is true.	Ọ bụ eziokwu.
It was very important to me then.	Ọ dị m ezigbo mkpa mgbe ahụ.
Let us take this historical opportunity.	Ka anyị were ohere akụkọ ihe mere eme a.
I'll make things worse again.	Aga m eme ka ihe ka njọ ọzọ.
It comes when it no longer works.	Ọ na-abịa mgbe ọ naghị arụ ọrụ ọzọ.
That could be for a number of reasons.	Nke nwere ike ịbụ maka ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
He rested himself.	O mere onwe ya izu ike.
Or maybe she gave birth to a baby.	Ma ọ bụ na ọ mụrụ nwa ma eleghị anya.
In a few years, it will be a spiritual city.	N'ime afọ ole na ole, ọ ga-abụ obodo mmụọ.
But they are not mine.	Ma ha abụghị nke m.
However, some couples do both.	Otú ọ dị, ụfọdụ di na nwunye na-eme ha abụọ.
I will never play again.	Agaghị m egwu egwu ọzọ.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
I have almost no limit on it.	Enwere m ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ enweghị oke na ya.
It is the life of a dog.	Ọ bụ ndụ nkịta.
There was nothing to think about.	Ọ nweghị ihe na-eche echiche banyere ya.
One should always be good.	Mmadụ kwesịrị ịdị mma mgbe niile.
You have a language idea.	Ị nwere echiche asụsụ.
He did not know how he got there.	Ọ maghị otú o si ruo ebe ahụ.
It made me very happy.	O mere m ezigbo mma.
However, this works for two purposes.	Otú ọ dị, nke a na-arụ ọrụ abụọ.
One man could not see it.	Otu nwoke apụghị ịhụ ya.
We are expected to do the same.	A tụrụ anya ka anyị mee otu ihe ahụ.
You know it, the flight attendant wants to know.	Ị maara ya, onye ọrụ ụgbọ elu chọrọ ịma.
We should use that idea in this country.	Anyị kwesịrị iji echiche ahụ na obodo a.
Only one of them works.	Naanị otu n'ime ha na-arụ ọrụ.
But she does not want to cry.	Ma ọ chọghị ibe ákwá.
Each of them has unique potential.	Nke ọ bụla n'ime ha nwere ike pụrụ iche.
That is what we do and that is the feeling we will have.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị na-eme na nke ahụ bụ mmetụta anyị ga-enwe.
Great job.	Nnukwu ọrụ.

She got the idea for the name from her daughter.	O nwetara echiche maka aha ahụ n'aka nwa ya nwanyị.
How can they convince us of their lies?	Olee otú ha ga-esi mee ka anyị kwere ụgha ha?

Not just for yourself, but for your daughter.	Ọ bụghị naanị maka onwe gị, mana maka nwa gị nwanyị.

For some, it is because they are weak.	Nye ụfọdụ ndị, ọ bụ n’ihi na ọ na-adịghị ike.

He understood very well.	Ọ ghọtara nke ọma.
They got it.	Ha nwetara ya.
They do not tell them that they are doing wrong.	Ha anaghị agwa ha na ha na-eme ihe ọjọọ.
His main concern was not the prisoners.	Ihe kacha ya mkpa abụghị ndị mkpọrọ.
She would love to see if it works.	Ọ ga-amasị ya ịhụ ma ọ dị mma.
The facts here are quite different.	Ihe ndị bụ́ eziokwu ebe a bụ nnọọ iche.

I have no regrets.	Enweghị m akwa ụta ọ bụla.
But that is not your fault.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị gị kpatara ya.
That may be his first time.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ nke mbụ ya.
There may be.	Enwere ike inwe.
We saw it last night.	Anyị hụrụ ya n'abalị ụnyaahụ.
I have a way to make a little money.	Enwere m ụzọ isi nweta obere ego.

This is a beautiful city surrounded by huge towers.	Nke a bụ obodo mara mma gbara nnukwu ụlọ elu gburugburu.
So you do all you can to make sure they are your friends.	Ya mere, ị na-eme ihe niile ị nwere ike ime iji hụ na ha bụ enyi gị.
We drove to the headquarters.	Anyị ji ụgbọ ala ruo n'isi ụlọ.
That is not the reason.	Ọ bụghị ya kpatara ya.
They all left here a long time ago.	Ha niile hapụrụ ebe a ezigbo oge gara aga.
He promised on the moon.	O kwere nkwa na ọnwa.
Faster than possible.	Ngwa ngwa karịa ka o kwere.
The city is known for its ongoing legislation.	A maara obodo ahụ maka iwu na-aga n'ihu.
But we should feel the situation.	Ma anyị kwesịrị inwe mmetụta nke ọnọdụ.
Tell him that you care.	Gwa ya na ị na-eche banyere ya.
There are reports.	Enwere akụkọ.
Today is your birthday.	Taa bụ ụbọchị ọmụmụ gị.
I think it is good for the phone.	Echere m na ọ dị mma maka ekwentị.

Once a month.	Otu ugboro kwa ọnwa .
But he should be happy to see it.	Ma, obi kwesịrị ịdị ya ụtọ ịhụ ya.
Now, there is only one more thing.	Ugbu a, enwere naanị otu ihe ọzọ.
He would not allow himself to be weak.	Ọ gaghị ekwe ka onwe ya adịghị ike.
I want you to tell me everything.	Achọrọ m ka ị gwa m ihe niile.
Give me strength.	Nweta m ike.
It was not that they were afraid of him.	Ọ bụghị na ha tụrụ ya ụjọ.
Everything has its time and place.	Ihe niile nwere oge na ebe.
Working on it.	Na-arụ ọrụ na ya.
But what can one do with such a baby bed.	Mana kedu ihe mmadụ nwere ike ime na nwa akwa akwa dị otú ahụ.
He was amazed at her thinking.	Iche echiche ya tụrụ ya n’anya.
There are still two more games to go.	A ka nwere egwuregwu abụọ ọzọ ị ga-aga.
It was here before.	Ọ bụ ebe a na mbụ.

When he died, he left his family behind.	Mgbe ọ nwụrụ, ọ hapụrụ ezinụlọ ya ihe niile.
When school will be different.	Mgbe ụlọ akwụkwọ ga-adị iche.
Things are not easy to find.	Ihe adịghị mfe ịchọta.
I love the head character.	Ahụrụ m onye isi agwa n'anya.
This is where they met.	Nke a bụ ebe ha zutere.
There is something wrong with them.	O nwere ihe dị ha n’anya.
I can't believe it.	Enweghị m ike ikweta ya.
Maybe I have two friends.	Eleghị anya enwere m ndị enyi abụọ.

This page is too long.	Ibe a dị ogologo.
You will love it !.	Ị ga-amasị ya!.
But people do that.	Ma ndị mmadụ na-eme otú ahụ.
He looked into the distance.	O lere anya n’ebe dị anya.
I am going to my business.	M na-aga ahịa m.
He knew he did not have it.	Ọ maara na o nweghị.
My book makes them both.	Akwụkwọ m na-eme ka ha abụọ bụrụ.
The idea is new.	Echiche ahụ dị ọhụrụ.
His back is as beautiful as his face.	Azụ ya mara mma ka ihu ya.
You need to tell him the truth no matter what.	I kwesịrị ịgwa ya eziokwu n’agbanyeghị ihe ọ bụla.
It's too bad.	Ọ dị oke njọ.
I think that would be great.	Echere m na nke ahụ ga-adị mma nke ukwuu.
It works well.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
This is very beautiful.	Nke a mara ezigbo mma.
It will be well in time.	Ọ ga-abụ nke ọma n'oge.
No one loves her.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya n'anya.
Here, they made the first car.	N'ebe a, ha mere ụgbọ ala mbụ.
The book is very beautiful.	Akwụkwọ ahụ mara ezigbo mma.
No more than 20 people attended the service.	Ọ dịghị ihe karịrị mmadụ iri abụọ bịara ọrụ ahụ.
We go to school for a variety of reasons.	Anyị na-aga akwụkwọ n'ihi ihe dị iche iche.
I think we did.	Echere m na anyị mere.
His perception of the city is low.	Echiche ya banyere obodo ahụ dị ala.
If you only want a reason that has a different function.	Ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ naanị ihe kpatara nwere ọrụ dị iche.
A person needs to eat well to stay healthy.	Mmadụ kwesịrị iri nri nke ọma ka ahụ́ dị ya mma.
He should not do it.	O kwesịghị ime ya.
It was the second in just a few weeks.	Ọ bụ nke abụọ ya n'ime naanị izu ole na ole.
Now is the time.	Ugbu a, oge bụ ugbu a.
It is so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma otú ahụ.
Beautiful clothes adorn the city.	Uwe ndị mara mma na-achọ obodo ahụ mma.
I want to get out of here.	Achọrọ m ịpụ ebe a.
There is nothing more he can do about it, of course.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ pụrụ ime banyere ya, n'ezie.
None of them.	Ọ dịghị otu n'ime ha.
I know he was right.	Ama m na o kwuru eziokwu.
He is one of them now.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ha ugbu a.
The work has its value.	Ọrụ ahụ nwere ọnụ ahịa ya.
For that, there are no regrets.	Maka nke ahụ, ọ dịghị akwa ụta ọ bụla.
You know the doctors.	Ị maara ndị dọkịta.
He needs money.	Ọ chọrọ ego.
So here too.	Ya mere kwa ebe a.
He didn't want to see the big body.	Ọ chọghị ịhụ nnukwu anụ ahụ.
No cars on the road?	Ọ nweghị ụgbọ ala ọ bụla n'ụzọ?
Be prepared, but not scary.	Dị njikere, mana ọ bụghị egwu.
I liked playing with the man.	Ọ masịrị m iso nwoke ahụ egwu egwu.
Your grandmother knows that.	Nne nne gị maara nke ahụ.
Perfect location.	Ezigbo ọnọdụ zuru oke.
You need it.	Ị chọrọ ya.
She wondered if there would be a baby there now.	Ọ nọ na-eche ma a ga-enwe nwa ọhụrụ ebe ahụ ugbu a.
Here, the difference is true.	N'ebe a, ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu.
Because we are human.	N'ihi na anyị bụ mmadụ.
I am ready for it.	Adị m njikere maka ya.
I like the house.	Ụlọ ahụ masịrị m.
Hardly anyone goes to prison, again.	O siri ike onye ọ bụla na-aga n'ụlọ mkpọrọ, ọzọ.
They travel with us.	Ha na anyị na-eme njem.
But that, of course, is your problem.	Mana nke ahụ, n'ezie, bụ nsogbu gị.
The cost is small, but better than nothing.	Ọnụ ego dị ntakịrị, mana ka mma karịa ihe ọ bụla.
The river is famous for water sports.	Osimiri a ma ama maka egwuregwu mmiri.
The reasons for doing so are the following.	Ihe kpatara ime nke a bụ ihe ndị a.
His age is an obvious advantage.	Afọ ndụ ya bụ uru doro anya.
I do not travel well.	Anaghị m eme njem nke ọma.
That's where the money is.	Ebe ahụ ka ego dị.
They are close to home.	Ha dị nso n'ụlọ.
You are not the only one who can get out of here.	Ọ bụghị naanị m ka ị ga-esi isi ebe a.
For me this is a big reason.	Maka m nke a bụ nnukwu ihe kpatara ya.
He refused to say anything.	Ọ jụrụ ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
That’s where your lunch is.	Nke ahụ bụ ebe nri ehihie gị dị.
I am full with him.	Mụ na ya zuru.
One monkey lives in a tree.	Otu enwe bi na osisi .
Most of them are very small.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha dị nnọọ obere.
But it doesn't work here.	Mana ọ naghị arụ ọrụ ebe a.
He spoke at length about his life.	O kwuru ogologo oge banyere ndụ ya.
That’s all his humor.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọchị ya niile.
To get out of your door and stay there.	Ka ị pụọ n'ọnụ ụzọ gị wee nọrọ ebe ahụ.
He is the only one.	Ọ bụ naanị ya.
The journey seemed like a long one.	Njem ahụ yiri ogologo oge.
Take a few years if you like.	Were afọ ole na ole ma ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị.
We are like their family.	Anyị dị ka ezinụlọ ha.
Because there is another bed.	N'ihi na e nwere akwa ọzọ.
He said it should be this.	O kwuru na ọ kwesịrị ịbụ nke a.
We'll have someone here in a minute.	Anyị ga-enwe onye ebe a n'otu nkeji.
They are all hopeless.	Ha niile enweghị olileanya.
His mother died when he was a child.	Nne ya nwụrụ mgbe ọ bụ nwata.
Talk to her mother, she is happy.	Gwa nne ya okwu, obi dị ya ụtọ.
We know a little about it.	Anyị maara ntakịrị banyere ya.
Thoughts about ignorance.	Echiche banyere amaghị ama.
That did not happen to me.	Nke ahụ emeghị m.
There is nothing special about that.	Ọ dịghị ihe pụrụ iche banyere nke ahụ.
Whatever it is it no longer needs.	Ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ na ọ dịghị mkpa ọzọ.
Very nice room.	Ime ụlọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
Not a story I really tell.	Ọ bụghị akụkọ m n'ezie ikwu.
We didn’t make a big trip.	Anyị emeghị nnukwu njem.
But only together.	Ma naanị ọnụ.
It will not work.	Ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ.
Then he would proceed with his work.	Mgbe ahụ ọ ga-aga n'ihu n'ọrụ ya.
I can see that he doesn’t want anything.	Enwere m ike ịhụ na ọ chọghị ihe ọ bụla.
He can't tell her, he can't make her see him.	O nweghị ike ịgwa ya, o nweghị ike ime ka ọ hụ ya.
I can drive one car at a time.	Enwere m ike ịnya otu ụgbọ ala n'otu oge.
But on vacation now.	Mana na ezumike ugbu a.
The moon is about ten minutes long.	Ọnwa dị ka nkeji iri.
They live everywhere.	Ha bi ebe niile.
Because nothing happens.	N'ihi na ọ dịghị ihe na-eme.
They never had children.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha mụrụ ụmụ.
Maybe he doesn't know anyone there.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ maghị onye ọ bụla n'ebe ahụ.
Tell me where you are.	Gwa m ebe ịnọ.
You need to make each other.	Ọ dị gị mkpa ime ibe gị.
Of course there should be another way.	N'ezie kwesịrị ịbụ ụzọ ọzọ.
Certainly not.	O doro anya na o nweghị.
All of this is true.	Ihe a niile bụ eziokwu.
We have a great time today.	Anyị nwere ezigbo oge taa.
Apparently the message did not rush around here.	O doro anya na ozi emeghị ngwa ngwa gburugburu ebe a.
He has a free will.	O nwere uche nwere onwe ya.
His car died again.	Ụgbọala ya nwụrụ ọzọ.
I feel so bad.	Ọ dị m njọ otú ahụ.
Vacation time is a good time to relax.	Oge ezumike bụ oge dị mma iji zuru ike.
We have only today.	Anyị nwere naanị taa.
This is where you were born.	Ọ bụ ebe a ka a mụrụ gị.
That should be the case.	Otú ahụ ka o kwesịrị ịdị.
This is a very serious matter.	Nke a bụ okwu dị oke njọ.
However, the point is as.	Otú ọ dị, isi okwu dị ka.
But there is no such thing.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ.
I run in time for town meetings.	M na-agba ọsọ n'oge maka nzukọ obodo.
We run from everything.	Anyị na-agba ọsọ site na ihe niile.

It's really big in it to be able to do that.	Ọ bụ n'ezie nnukwu n'ime ya inwe ike ime nke ahụ.
I'm looking for the order.	Ana m achọ iwu ahụ.
The country house is a beautiful house.	Ụlọ ime obodo bụ ụlọ mara mma.
I'll see you in the morning.	Aga m ahụ gị n'ụtụtụ.
I do not like this book.	Akwụkwọ a enweghị m mmasị.
He took the need seriously.	O tinyere mkpa ahụ nke ọma.
We can help them a little.	Anyị nwere ike inyere ha obere aka.
The musical games have a different way of working.	Egwuregwu egwu ndị ahụ nwere ụzọ ọrụ dị iche.
My mother works in her company.	Nne m na-arụ ọrụ n'ụlọ ọrụ ya.
We are there.	Anyị nọ ebe ahụ.
The villagers made use of this historic building.	Ndị obodo ahụ ji ụlọ a mere eme ihe ọnụ.
I would not be blamed for everything.	Agaraghị m ụta maka ihe niile.
I never bought it for you.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m zụtara gị ya.

The man continued.	Nwoke ahụ gara n'ihu.
The room is next to the living room.	Ụlọ ahụ dị n'akụkụ ọnụ ụlọ ahụ.
Children have many friends.	Ụmụaka nwere ọtụtụ enyi.
But nothing was said.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe e kwuru.
Some are letters.	Ụfọdụ bụ akwụkwọ ozi.
At first, we thought it would not work.	Na mbụ, anyị chere na ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ.
He needs information.	Ọ chọrọ ozi.
What they do, they do, but they will not do anything new.	Ihe ha na-eme, ha na-eme, ma ha agaghị eme ihe ọhụrụ.
I can't use this baby at all right now.	Enweghị m ike iji nwa ọhụrụ a mee ihe ọ bụla ugbu a.

I think everything is fine when you can make it fun.	Echere m na ihe ọ bụla dị mma mgbe ị nwere ike ime ka ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
It's just money.	Ọ bụ naanị ego.
I was very angry.	Iwe were m nke ukwuu.
She was amazed by her story.	Akụkọ ya tụrụ ya n’anya.
Here is the simple message.	Nke a bụ ozi dị mfe.
The place is a house with a big old house.	Ebe ahụ bụ ụlọ nwere nnukwu ụlọ ochie.
History has done it.	Akụkọ ihe mere eme mere ya.
I love this.	Ahụrụ m nke a n'anya.
I hope it works out.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ ga-aga nke ọma.
I want you to know that.	Achọrọ m ka ị mara nke ahụ.
You can get more money from this company.	Ị nwere ike nweta ego karịa n'aka ụlọ ọrụ a.
He spent many hours in his new job.	O tinyere ọtụtụ awa n'ọrụ ọhụrụ ya.
Many couples stayed.	Ọtụtụ di na nwunye nọrọ.
In this, there will be many.	Na nke a, a ga-enwe ọtụtụ.
Good is what we are trying to be here.	Dị mma bụ ihe anyị na-agbalị ịnọ ebe a.
Having a good day?	Inwe ezigbo ụbọchị?
Modern woman.	Nwanyị oge a.
Her friend looked good, ready to help when needed.	Enyi ya lere anya nke ọma, dị njikere inye aka mgbe ọ dị mkpa.
However, there is nothing wrong with that.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị njọ otú ahụ.
You can see it here.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ya ebe a.
I am new.	Adị m ọhụrụ.
Otherwise there is nothing more awesome, whatever people say.	Ma ọ bụghị na ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ dị egwu, ihe ọ bụla ndị mmadụ na-ekwu.
He is unhappy for anyone or anything.	Obi adịghị ya mma maka onye ọ bụla ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
The whole machine is very clear.	Igwe igwe niile doro anya nke ọma.
Fear is alive inside me.	Egwu dị ndụ n'ime m.
He knew it would not be easy.	Ọ ma na ọ gaghị adị mfe.
But it will be more than that.	Ma ọ ga-abụ karịa nke ahụ.
I love that.	Ahụrụ m nke ahụ n'anya.
If you know what you are doing and why, fine.	Ọ bụrụ na ị maara ihe ị na-eme na ihe kpatara ya, ọ dị mma.
Then it doesn't go away.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ dịghị aga.
Tell them to leave, fast forward.	Gwa ha ka ha pụọ, ọsọ zuru oke n'ihu.
The full song can be found here.	Enwere ike ịhụ abụ zuru oke ebe a.
There are several reasons for this.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara nke a.
This is true of most people there.	Nke a bụ eziokwu maka ọtụtụ ndị nọ n'ebe ahụ.
But he started to act.	Ma ọ malitere ime ihe.
We continued.	Anyị gara n'ihu.
This can be done in a variety of ways.	Enwere ike iji ụzọ dị iche iche mee nke a.
I do not think his wife really likes me.	Echeghị m na nwunye ya na-amasị m nke ukwuu.
He began to go out.	Ọ malitere ịpụ.
We should not.	Anyị ekwesịghị.
I am not well.	Adịghị m ike nke ọma.
The dance runs fast and furious.	Ịgba egwu ahụ na-agba ọsọ ọsọ na iwe.
Be happy.	Nwee obi ụtọ.
Maybe if you read a little something.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụrụ na ị na-agụ ntakịrị ihe.
But the key is to do more than anything.	Ma isi ihe bụ ime ihe karịa ihe ọ bụla.
Something happens here, every time.	Otu ihe na-eme ebe a, oge ọ bụla.
It's like a family.	Ọ dị ka ezinụlọ.
I see that now.	Ahụrụ m nke ahụ ugbu a.
They thought it was funny.	Ha chere na ọ bụ ihe ọchị.
You can be anything you want.	Ị nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọ bụla ịchọrọ.
Some people are happy with who they are.	Ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ na-enwe obi ụtọ na onye ha hụrụ n'anya.
That's the way it works.	Otú ahụ ka o si arụ ọrụ.
At the airport, they waited in awe.	N'ọdụ ụgbọ elu, ha ji ụjọ chere.
They are the only ones there.	Naanị ha nọ ebe ahụ.
Of course there are different ways to do this.	N'ezie enwere ụzọ dị iche iche isi mee nke a.
At home and at work and sports.	N'ụlọ na n'ebe ọrụ na egwuregwu.
But did not understand until morning.	Ma aghọtaghị ruo ụtụtụ.
The weather this morning is much better.	Ihu igwe nke ụtụtụ a dị mma karịa.
It’s not that they don’t want a vacation.	Ọ bụghị na ha achọghị ezumike.
I think this is it.	Echere m na nke a bụ ya.
I told him if you wanted to leave.	Agwara m ya ma ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ ịla.
We can not.	Anyị enweghị ike.
He is still alive.	Ọ ka dị ndụ.
Everything we say or do is wrong.	Ihe ọ bụla anyị na-ekwu ma ọ bụ mee adịghị mma.
That is what most people do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọtụtụ mmadụ na-eme.
He had a high opinion of himself.	O nwere echiche dị elu banyere onwe ya.
Next, he asked me to go and see who he was.	Ọzọ, ọ gwara m ka m gaa hụ onye ọ bụ.
Such statements are questionable.	Okwu ndị dị otú ahụ nwere obi abụọ.
A little higher.	Elu ntakịrị.
Well, not too much.	Ọ dị mma, ọ bụghị oke.
Every day this test is the same.	Kwa ụbọchị ule a bụ otu.
Then.	Mgbe ahụ .
This event surprised me.	Ihe omume a tụrụ m n'anya.
But they are right.	Ma ha kwuru eziokwu.
But that is uncertain.	Ma nke ahụ ejighị n'aka.
They know what he did.	Ha ma ihe o mere.
Obviously that’s what’s in it.	O doro anya na ọ bụ ihe dị n'ime ya.
It may have been 20 years earlier.	O nwere ike ịbụ afọ iri abụọ tupu mgbe ahụ.
But nothing was done.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe e mere.
He’s interested, sometimes.	O nwere mmasị, mgbe ụfọdụ.
I feel what other people are thinking.	Enwere m mmetụta ihe ndị ọzọ na-eche.
Then that's what you have to do.	Mgbe ahụ, nke ahụ bụ ihe ị ga-eme.
Now he is not here because of him.	Ugbu a o nweghị ebe a n'ihi ya.
It’s just something you have to do.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe ị ga-eme.
Of course they say.	N'ezie ha na-ekwu.
They are best when the weather is a little cold.	Ha kacha mma mgbe ihu igwe dara ntakịrị.
Whatever that could be.	Ihe ọ bụla nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ.
It is a gift.	Ọ bụ ihe e nyere.
He went to the bookstore one day.	Ọ banyere n'ụlọ ahịa akwụkwọ otu ụbọchị.

However, that would not be a plan at all.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ agaghị abụ atụmatụ ma ọlị.
No one refused.	Ọ dịghị onye jụrụ.
I was given a difficult job.	E nyere m ọrụ siri ike.
Now, that’s my opinion.	Ugbu a, nke ahụ bụ uche m.
I am an ongoing project.	Abụ m ọrụ na-aga n'ihu.
As much as possible.	Dị ka o kwere mee.
Come, stay with him for many years.	Bịa, gị na ya nọrọ ọtụtụ afọ.
He swims a lot.	Ọ na-egwu mmiri nke ukwuu.
We know we both live here.	Anyị ma na anyị abụọ bi ebe a.
For the night.	Maka abalị abalị.
This story is not about them.	Akụkọ a abụghị gbasara ha.
I feel like we are in the same boat.	Ọ dị m ka anyị nọ n'otu ụgbọ mmiri.
Such ones need to take action within themselves.	Ndị dị otú ahụ kwesịrị ime ihe n'ime onwe ha.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
In fact, he started out as an actor.	N'ezie, ọ malitere dị ka onye na-eme ihe nkiri.
My guess is that there are some really good things happening.	Echiche m bụ na e nwere ụfọdụ ezigbo ihe na-eme.
Now there is a problem.	Ugbu a enwere nsogbu.
They never had a chance.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha nwere ohere.
Then, of course, he got angry.	Mgbe ahụ, n'ezie, o were iwe.
If you are telling the truth, we should go.	Ọ bụrụ na ị na-ekwu eziokwu, anyị kwesịrị ịga.
Lots of plants, better.	Ọtụtụ osisi, ka mma.
As much as it can.	Dị ka ọ nwere ike.
The city is a great place to find work.	Obodo bụ ebe dị mma ịchọta ọrụ.
Only you can do that.	Naanị gị nwere ike ime nke ahụ.
Who would want to be our friend on this trip ?.	Kedu onye ga-achọ ịbụ enyi anyị na njem a?.
I was really scared to see him.	Ụjọ tụrụ m n'ezie ịhụ ya.
It's better now.	Ọ ka mma ugbu a.
Now there is no time.	Ugbu a enweghị oge.
I love my house.	Ahụrụ m ụlọ m n'anya.
The idea is basic.	Echiche ahụ bụ isi.
These are not just games.	Ihe ndị a abụghị naanị egwuregwu.
But not here or now.	Ma ọ bụghị ebe a ma ọ bụ ugbu a.
I will not buy the new car.	Agaghị m azụ ụgbọ ala ọhụrụ ahụ.
I looked at them.	M lere ha anya.
It is good to see the way this is done.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ ụzọ a si eme ya.
But we fear it will happen.	Ma anyị na-atụ egwu na ọ ga-eme ya.
This news frightened him.	Akụkọ a tụrụ ya ụjọ.
They will not see it.	Ha agaghị ahụ ya.
It is my second week here.	Ọ bụ izu nke abụọ m ebe a.
This can be an accident.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ ihe mberede.
There is another place that comes from, after all.	Enwere ihe ọzọ ebe nke si, mgbe niile.
And next to her a picture of a woman.	Na n'akụkụ ya foto nke nwanyị.
You can talk to him at any time.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa ya okwu oge ọ bụla.
She has only one dress.	O nwere naanị otu uwe.
But we did not see it.	Mana anyị ahụghị ka ọ dị.

That would be bad for the spirit.	Nke ahụ gaara adị njọ maka mmụọ.
A little bit of it is bad.	Obere ntakịrị n'ime ya dị njọ.
Just a minute.	Naanị otu nkeji.
I do not want to be alone.	Achọghị m ịnọ naanị m.
All my staff were there.	Ndị ọrụ m niile nọ na nke ahụ.
They do not know each other.	Ha amaghị ibe ha.
This route can be used for travel.	Enwere ike iji ụzọ a mee njem.
But well, the next day, it did.	Ma nke ọma, ụbọchị nke ọzọ, o mere.
These interests are really important.	Mmasị ndị a dị mkpa n'ezie.
But that is good.	Mana nke ahụ dị mma.
The problem is that they do not.	Nsogbu bụ na ha enweghị.
He thought it was not good.	O chere na ọ bụghị mma.
Nobody did that.	O nweghị onye mere otú ahụ.

At one point, he was confident.	N'otu oge, ọ nwere obi ike.
There is no time limit for any company.	Enweghị oke oge maka ụlọ ọrụ ọ bụla.
On the other hand, it does not seem to do.	N'aka, ọ ga-adị ka ọ gaghị eme ya.

To provide a letter.	Iji nye akwụkwọ ozi.
Obviously, old.	O doro anya, nke ochie.
But they do speak because they love people.	Ma ha kwuru okwu n’ihi na ha hụrụ ndị mmadụ n’anya.
This is not a command to love one another.	Nke a abụghị iwu ka anyị hụ onwe anyị n'anya.
For two or three desserts.	Maka nri ụtọ abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ.
The former are more numerous than the latter.	Ndị mbụ dị ọtụtụ karịa nke ikpeazụ.
He never told the truth.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-ekwu eziokwu.
He has no real friends.	O nweghị ezigbo ndị enyi.
He told her that his life was short.	Ọ gwara ya na ndụ ya dị ntakịrị.
The other looked at it carefully.	Onye nke ọzọ lere ya anya nke ọma.
The truth may be unparalleled.	Eziokwu nwere ike ịbụ ihe na-enweghị atụ.
He went and gave the baby to his mother.	Ọ gara were nwa ahụ nye nne ya.

Everything is still going.	Ihe niile ka na-aga.

The man and woman looked at the phone.	Nwoke ahụ na nwanyị ahụ lere ekwentị anya.
Not immediately.	Ọ bụghị ozugbo.
It is very new.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ihe ọhụrụ.

It is not the only reason.	Ọ bụghị naanị otu ihe kpatara ya.
So nothing really needs to be said.	N'ihi ya, ọ dịghị ihe n'ezie kwesịrị ikwu.

That is why you must give me the letter.	Ọ bụ ya mere ị ga-eji nye m akwụkwọ ozi ahụ.
He should not have known that but he did, of course.	O kwesịghị ịma nke ahụ mana o mere, n'ezie.

Everyone was scared.	Onye ọ bụla tụrụ egwu.

He himself is the main threat.	Ọ bụ ya n'onwe ya bụ isi ihe egwu.
Everything else is secondary.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ bụ nke abụọ.
Where life is, there is hope.	Ebe ndụ dị, olileanya dị.

They read it all the time, obviously.	Ha na-agụ ya mgbe niile, o doro anya.
However, it is not as hot.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị dị ka ọkụ.

Things could be better.	Ihe nwere ike ịdị mma.
On the surface, a better idea.	Na elu elu, mma echiche.

Maybe the anger is a little off.	Ma eleghị anya, iwe dị ntakịrị.

If nothing happens, you better go.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ nweghị ihe mere, ị dị mma ịga.
So much so, he thought.	Nke ukwuu mgbe ụfọdụ, o chere.
Maybe he is busy now.	Ma eleghị anya ọ nọ n'ọrụ ugbu a.
The teacher is sitting next to me.	Onye nkuzi nọ ọdụ n'akụkụ.

So every moment is the same as any other.	Ya mere, oge ọ bụla bụ otu ihe ahụ ka ọ bụla ọzọ.
He wants to do everything.	Ọ chọrọ ime ihe niile.
He would not know of anyone having such a large heart.	Ọ gaghị ama onye ọ bụla nwere nnukwu obi dị otú ahụ.

Some machines are not suitable for home use.	Igwe ụfọdụ adịghị mma maka iji n'ụlọ.
He thought he would never see her again.	O chere na ya ahụghị nwanyị ahụ ọzọ.

Not one at a time.	Ọ bụghị otu otu.

He was on a journey with his music.	Ọ nọ na njem ya na egwu egwu ya.

They both make sense to me.	Ha abụọ nwere ezi uche nye m.

By the way, maybe it's better.	N'ụzọ, ma eleghị anya, ọ ka mma.

They never make friends with one another.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha na ibe ha na-eme enyi.
Otherwise, you know, not often.	Ma ọ bụghị, ị maara, ọ bụghị ọtụtụ mgbe.
He was a strong teacher, but righteous.	Ọ bụ onye nkuzi siri ike, mana ezi omume.
He is a hypocrite.	Ọ bụ onye ihu abụọ.

That’s why we feel the urgency.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị ji enwe mmetụta nke ịdị ngwa ahụ.

This is kind of funny.	Nke a bụ ụdị ọchị n'ezie.

However, one problem can occur with its application may be its length.	Otú ọ dị, otu nsogbu nwere ike ime na ngwa ya nwere ike ịbụ ogologo ya.
You are a good friend.	Ị bụ ezigbo enyi.
Or such a thing.	Ma ọ bụ ihe dị otú ahụ.

At the time, it was your job or your journey.	N'oge ahụ, ọ bụ ọrụ gị ma ọ bụ njem gị.

Good to read fast.	Ọ dị mma na-agụ ngwa ngwa.

This is the perfect opportunity.	Nke a bụ ohere zuru oke.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ ikwu banyere ya.
He did not want to tell me again.	Ọ chọghị ịgwa m ọzọ.
I can get out of my house.	Enwere m ike ịpụ n'ụlọ m.
He will surely succeed.	O doro anya na ọ ga-eme nke ọma.
But when you think about it, it’s really huge.	Ma mgbe ị na-eche banyere ya, ọ bụ n'ezie nnukwu.
Find someone to help.	Chọọ onye ga-enyere aka.
The police at both airports are working well.	Ndị uwe ojii na ọdụ ụgbọ elu abụọ ahụ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Still, it's a tough game.	N'agbanyeghị, ọ bụ ihe egwuregwu siri ike.

He still loves her.	Ọ ka hụrụ ya n'anya.
If you expect evil, you will have evil.	Ọ bụrụ na ị na-atụ anya ihe ọjọọ, ị ga-enwe ihe ọjọọ.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
My mother, however, was another story.	Otú ọ dị, nne m bụ akụkọ ọzọ.
They did it.	Ha mere ya.
He obviously had reason to believe that this son was not his.	O doro anya na o nwere ihe mere ọ ga-eji kwere na nwa a abụghị nke ya.
Here are some ideas about what we are looking for.	Nke a bụ ụfọdụ echiche gbasara ihe anyị na-achọ.
That's when he told her.	Ọ bụ n’oge ahụ ka ọ gwara ya.
No one else entered.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ banyere.
He did not seem surprised.	O yighị ka o juru ya anya.
But this is really going backwards.	Ma nke a n'ezie na-aga azụ.
The people of the city did the same.	Ndị obodo ahụ mere otu ihe ahụ.
The first type is fear of people.	Ụdị nke mbụ bụ egwu ndị mmadụ .

That really surprised me.	Nke ahụ tụrụ m n'anya n'ezie.
They have no education.	Ha enweghị akwụkwọ.
Everyone has a car.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ụgbọ ala.
But they seem to be working well.	Ma ọ dị ka ha na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
I am a new girl.	Abụ m nwa agbọghọ ọhụrụ.
The game does other things.	Egwuregwu ahụ na-eme ihe ndị ọzọ.
Her children do not love her very much.	Ụmụ ya ahụghị ya n’anya nke ukwuu.
The age is very different from the two groups.	Afọ dị nnọọ iche na otu abụọ ahụ.
The stadium is packed.	Ụlọ egwuregwu juru n'ọnụ.
The second thing.	Ihe nke abụọ.
That does not happen.	Nke ahụ anaghị eme.
But wait an hour.	Ma chere otu awa.
I'm at your service.	Anọ m n'ọrụ gị.
He went to the door.	Ọ gara n'ọnụ ụzọ.
And most importantly.	Na nke kacha mkpa.
They are in it.	Ha nọ na ya.
It took two days.	Ọ were ụbọchị abụọ.
But first things first.	Ma mbụ ihe mbụ.
I do not know how, either.	Amaghị m otú, ma ọ bụ.
What can we do about this?	Kedu ihe anyị ga-eme nke a?
Either way, we are here to help as always.	Kedu ụzọ ọ bụla, anyị nọ ebe a iji nyere aka dị ka mgbe niile.
Every woman should be a mother.	Nwanyị ọ bụla kwesịrị ịbụ nne.
He is very cold.	O juru ya nnọọ oyi.
In song.	Na abụ.
There is a time to love.	Enwere oge ịhụ n'anya.
I do not know how to get that.	Amaghị m ka m ga-esi nweta nke ahụ.
But we have nothing else.	Ma anyị enweghị ihe ọzọ.
I do not love him.	Ahụghị m ya n'anya.
We seem happy.	Anyị yiri obi ụtọ.
It really happened.	O mere n'ezie.
Some rules are very strict.	Ụfọdụ iwu siri oke ike.
They want what we want.	Ha chọrọ ihe anyị chọrọ.
Now that is a really scary movie!	Ugbu a nke ahụ bụ ihe nkiri na-atụ egwu n'ezie!
I like community meetings.	Enwere m mmasị na nzukọ obodo.
A little bit about that.	Obere ntakịrị banyere nke ahụ.
If you think you are surprised.	Ọ bụrụ na ị chere na ọ tụrụ gị n'anya.
It is a promise.	Ọ bụ nkwa.
I have a big day ahead.	Enwere m nnukwu ụbọchị n'ihu.
He said it was good.	O kwuru na ọ dị mma.
It’s a bad car route.	Ọ bụ ụzọ ụgbọ ala na-adịghị mma.
Not that this makes it easier.	Ọ bụghị na nke a na-eme ka ọ dị mfe.
But then the best thing happened.	Ma mgbe ahụ ihe kacha mma mere.
He fed the baby.	O nyere nwa ahụ nri.
That should be a matter of law.	Nke ahụ kwesịrị ịbụ ihe gbasara iwu.
The car was speeding.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ nọ na-agba ọsọ.
A man is in your room.	Otu nwoke nọ n'ime ime ụlọ gị.
I have a break today.	Enwere m ezumike taa.
I want to be like everyone else.	Achọrọ m ịdị ka onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
But you will not do it.	Ma ị gaghị eme ya.
Others, not so much.	Ndị ọzọ, ọ bụghị nke ukwuu.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
To him, all people are one.	N'ebe ọ nọ, mmadụ niile bụ otu.
He had something to do.	O nwere ihe o mere.
But he does not know that you know.	Ma ọ maghị na ị maara.
Our lives are far more valuable.	Ndụ anyị bara nnọọ uru karịa otú ahụ.
Give this gift to others.	Nye ndị ọzọ onyinye a.
I love it but this is a joke.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya mana nke a bụ ihe ọchị.
There was never any water.	Ọ dịghị mgbe mmiri ọ bụla.
Not that long.	Ọ bụghị ogologo oge ahụ.
He is not happy.	Obi adịghị ya ụtọ.
Many people have used it.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ji ya mee ihe.
Some customers are not happy with the service.	Ụfọdụ ndị ahịa enweghị obi ụtọ na ọrụ ahụ.
Because that's what he has to do.	N'ihi na nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ ga-eme.
I have a picture of me.	Enwere foto m.
So it would be anything.	Ya mere ọ ga-abụ ihe ọ bụla.
A third person was interviewed.	A gbara ajụjụ ọnụ onye nke atọ.
He looked a little.	Ọ lere anya ntakịrị.
It made me angry that they might think so about me.	O were m iwe na ha nwere ike iche otú ahụ banyere m.
Our trip took us to an old town.	Njem anyị mere ka anyị gaa n'otu obodo ochie.
He called his name.	Ọ kpọrọ aha ya.
We can help with finances, transportation and more.	Anyị nwere ike inye aka na ego, ụgbọ njem na ihe ndị ọzọ.
That would be to say something.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ na-ekwu ihe.
I am very afraid of him.	M na-atụ ya egwu nke ukwuu.
In this, once, maybe both of them are telling the truth.	Na nke a, otu ugboro, ma eleghị anya ha abụọ na-ekwu eziokwu.
This is their money.	Nke a bụ ego ha.
They should stay there for a day.	Ha kwesịrị ịnọ ebe ahụ otu ụbọchị.
We have what you need.	Anyị nwere ihe ị chọrọ.
He stopped at old people's homes every day.	Ọ kwụsịrị n'ụlọ ochie ndị mmadụ kwa ụbọchị.
This is a special case.	Nke a bụ ikpe pụrụ iche.
The issue is similar.	Okwu a yiri nke a.
Everything is on his mind.	Ihe niile dị ya n'obi nke ukwuu.
Much more.	Ọtụtụ ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
He was called to report.	A kpọrọ ya ka o nye akụkọ.
That is why this is so.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe mere na nke a.
But hardly anyone lives that way today.	Ma o siri ike na onye ọ bụla dị ndụ otú ahụ taa.
One might want that to still work well.	Mmadụ nwere ike chọọ ka nke ahụ ka na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
But the rural population has almost no access.	Ma ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ na ndị bi n'ime ime obodo enweghị ohere.
In fact, do it in about three years.	N'ezie, mee ya ihe dị ka afọ atọ.
I see the value in others.	Ahụrụ m gị uru na ndị ọzọ adịghị.
It seems clear now.	Ọ dị ka ihe doro anya ugbu a.
I have a lot of money.	Enwere m nnukwu ego.
I want to say this, anyway.	Achọrọ m ikwu nke a, n'agbanyeghị.
But that would not be true.	Ma nke ahụ agaghị abụ eziokwu.
Our service is great to help you.	Ọrụ anyị dị oke mma inyere gị aka.
It's like here.	Ọ dị ka ebe a.
I have nothing, man.	Enweghị m ihe ọ bụla, nwoke.
But it works well.	Mana ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
This is almost stupid.	Nke a fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ nzuzu.
Now is the time to be ready.	Ugbu a, bụ mgbe ọ dị njikere.
The fire was bad.	Ọkụ ahụ dị njọ.
The others are a little out there.	Ndị ọzọ dị ntakịrị n'ebe ahụ.
They may be without me for a few days.	Na ha nwere ike na-enweghị m ụbọchị ole na ole.
This is a big deal.	Nke a bụ nnukwu ihe.
This is like that.	Nke a dị ka nke ahụ.
This is very new.	Nke a bụ nnọọ ihe ọhụrụ.
Otherwise, it looks really good.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ mara ezigbo mma.
There is something special about those humans.	E nwere ihe pụrụ iche banyere ụmụ mmadụ ahụ.
Some idea of ​​this is great for me.	Ụfọdụ echiche nke ihe a bụ ịdị ukwuu nye m.
No one told the story.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru akụkọ ahụ.
There is only one possible way.	Enwere naanị otu ụzọ enwere ike.
It works for us.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka anyị.
I need small.	Achọrọ m obere.
Everything needs and needs to be done.	Ihe niile chọrọ na mkpa ime ka ga-eme ya.
Not in itself, of course.	Ọ bụghị n'onwe ya, n'ezie.
Now is your time to do the same.	Ugbu a bụ oge gị ime otu.
He never left her.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ hapụrụ ya.
Just help him !.	Naanị nye ya aka!.
Laws and community service for everyone else.	Iwu na ọrụ obodo maka onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
I am very happy to be here.	Obi dị m ezigbo ụtọ ịnọ ebe a.
It came suddenly.	Ọ bịara na mberede.
Of course not.	Ọ bụghị n'ezie.
Most of them have nothing for my children.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha enweghị ihe ọ bụla nye ụmụ m.
All those people will go somewhere.	Ndị ahụ niile ga-aga ebe.
It's a little weird.	Ọ dị ntakịrị ala ọzọ.
It is ten times.	Ọ bụ mgbe iri.
But then he left.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ pụọ.
It looks so good on it.	Ọ mara ezigbo mma na ya.
That is the most important thing.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe kacha mkpa.
There is only one problem.	Enwere naanị otu nsogbu.
I still had many of them, at the time.	M ka nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha, n'oge ahụ.
Nothing important now.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị mkpa ugbu a.
Keep yourself busy.	Mee onwe gị ọrụ n'aka.
Human activities will be there.	Ihe omume mmadụ ga-adị ebe ahụ.
It really made our day.	O mere ụbọchị anyị n'ezie.
This is not a good idea.	Nke a abụghị ezigbo echiche.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ọ bụ ya bụ ezigbo ihe.
It is there.	Ọ dị ebe ahụ.
Time goes by.	Oge na-aga.
Everything is wet or wet.	Ihe niile dị mmiri ma ọ bụ mmiri.
I do not know why they bought them.	Amaghị m ihe mere ha ji zụta ha.
I went to the back of the plane.	M gara n'azụ ụgbọ elu.
Good news you can think of.	Ozi ọma ị nwere ike iche.
I don't know why, but I'm fine.	Amaghị m ihe kpatara ya, mana ọ dị m mma.
Of good character.	Nke ezi agwa.
Lunch and dinner are served daily.	A na-eri nri ehihie na nri abalị kwa ụbọchị.
The new man seems to have no interest in anyone else.	Nwoke ọhụrụ ahụ yiri onye ọ bụla na-enweghị mmasị n'ebe onye ọ bụla ọzọ nọ.
I just refused to give it a chance.	Naanị m hapụrụ inye ya ohere.
They have very similar ideas.	Ha nwere nnọọ otu echiche.
That was my job as a wife and mother.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ m dị ka nwunye na nne.
He is a beautiful person.	Ọ bụ onye mara mma.
I just think it can.	M nnọọ na-eche na ọ nwere ike.
It's wrong to be here.	Ọ dị njọ na ọ ga-adị ebe a.
It is what you want.	Ọ bụ ihe ị chọrọ.
I do not like the idea.	Enweghị m mmasị na echiche ahụ.
That is exactly what a woman is.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ ihe nwanyị bụ.
I met a lot of people at the party.	M zutere ọtụtụ mmadụ na oriri ahụ.
But you know.	Ma ị maara.
The greatest joy in life is to help others.	Ihe kacha atọ ụtọ ná ndụ bụ inyere ndị ọzọ aka.
I may not be there.	Enwere m ike na agaghị m ebe ahụ.
You never have.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ị nwere.
It's bad.	Ọ dị njọ.
Which of course, they are not.	Kedu nke n'ezie, ha abụghị.
Then he thought he might call her the next night.	Mgbe ahụ o chere na ọ pụrụ ịkpọ ya n'abalị echi.
It was his first newspaper in almost two years.	Ọ bụ akwụkwọ akụkọ mbụ ya n’ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ afọ abụọ.
I drink water.	M na-aṅụ mmiri.
The plan failed.	Atụmatụ ahụ dara.
He said that was true.	O kwuru na nke ahụ bụ eziokwu.
The other two go to every corner of my bed.	Abụọ ndị ọzọ na-aga n'akụkụ ọ bụla nke akwa m.
He refused to eat breakfast.	Ọ jụrụ iri nri ụtụtụ.
There are many examples of this.	E nwere ọtụtụ ihe atụ nke a.
This is a great vacation.	Nke a bụ nnukwu ezumike.
But some of the dead have life.	Ma ụfọdụ ndị nwụrụ anwụ kwesịrị ndụ.
It was then.	Ọ bụ n'oge ahụ.
Trees are alive, no.	Osisi dị ndụ, mba.
You tried your best.	Ị gbalịrị ike gị.
We say a lot.	Anyị na-ekwu ọtụtụ ihe.
Vacation is required here.	Achọrọ ezumike ebe a.
Big problem.	Nnukwu nsogbu.
But of course, all to say if you play it better.	Ma n'ezie, ya niile ikwu ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-egwu ya mma.
This is a beautiful wine.	Nke a bụ mmanya mara mma.
I love this thing so much !.	Ahụrụ m ihe a n'anya nke ukwuu!.
I need my friends.	Achọrọ m ndị enyi m.
Of course, this will not be easy.	N'ezie, nke a agaghị adị mfe.
The human mind has its own limits.	Uche mmadụ nwere oke nke ya.
When it got a little hot, it got a little cold.	Mgbe o nwetara ntakịrị ọkụ, o wee nwee ntakịrị oyi.
It's not bad, it's not very good.	Ọ dịghị njọ, ọ dịghị nnọọ mma.
But now it seems to be happening again.	Ma ugbu a ọ dị ka ọ na-eme ọzọ.
We are all actors.	Anyị niile bụ ndị na-eme ihe nkiri.
I was very happy to have that opportunity.	Enwere m nnọọ obi ụtọ inwe ohere ahụ.
People know me.	Ndị mmadụ ma m.
That is what it is.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ bụ.
There are so many.	Ọ dị ọtụtụ.
In more than one way.	Na ihe karịrị otu ụzọ.
Obviously, that does not make sense.	O doro anya na nke ahụ abụghị ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
You are not proud of yourself, are you?	Ị naghị akpa onwe gị ọnụ, ị bụ?
Each left three children.	Onye ọ bụla hapụrụ ụmụ atọ.
He did something about it.	O mere ihe na ya.
It’s a side effect.	Ọ bụ mmetụta dị n'akụkụ.
It's very good.	Ọ dị nnọọ mma.
She is his sister.	Ọ bụ nwanne ya nwanyị.
The wine is special.	Mmanya ahụ pụrụ iche.
I had negative feelings about myself.	Enwere m mmetụta ọjọọ banyere onwe m.
They have no idea what they are up to.	Ha amaghị nnọọ ihe ha nọ na ya.
It is the first time.	Ọ bụ nke mbụ ya.
Most of the time, it is not.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ọ bụghị.
He does not know if his mother is still alive.	Ọ maghị ma nne ya ọ̀ ka dị ndụ.
He will not die alone.	Ọ gaghị anwụ naanị ya.
Which is a thing.	Nke bụ ihe.
I have your back on everything.	Enwere m azụ gị n'ihe niile.
It is not just that in the past.	Ọ bụghị naanị ịdị anya otú ahụ n'oge gara aga.
I knew they had nothing in me.	Ama m na ha enweghị ihe ọ bụla n'ime m.
This should not be done.	E kwesịghị ime nke a.
Whatever you have at home.	Ihe ọ bụla ị nwere n'ụlọ.
That makes them good or bad.	Nke ahụ na-eme ka ha dị mma ma ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ.
He made one and gave it to me.	O mere otu ma nye m ya.
It's awesome.	Ọ egwu .
I had negative feelings about life.	Enwere m mmetụta ọjọọ banyere ndụ.
Two people and a dog.	Mmadụ abụọ na nkịta.
Our little family.	Ezinụlọ anyị nta.
Every man has a value, it seems.	Nwoke ọ bụla nwere ọnụ ahịa, ọ dị ka.
Not this time or any other time.	Ọ bụghị oge a ma ọ bụ oge ọ bụla ọzọ.
You did well.	I mere nke ọma.
The restaurant is packed.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ juru n'ọnụ.
It can be really good.	O nwere ike ịdị mma n'ezie.
I never understood what they were thinking.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m ghọtara ihe ha na-eche.
She wants a weekend at home.	Ọ chọrọ izu ụka n'ụlọ.
But we can imagine.	Ma anyị nwere ike iche.
What he said was what he said.	Ihe o kwuru bụ ihe o kwuru.
It seems so far.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị anya ruo ugbu a.
The church is there.	Ụka dị ebe ahụ.
Everything will be fine.	Ihe niile ga-adị mma.
That is the history of the song.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ihe mere eme nke abụ ahụ.
It works in two ways.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ abụọ.
Still, the cost of capital will be huge.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọnụ ahịa isi obodo ga-adị nnukwu.
He asked me for money.	Ọ jụrụ m ego.
Great place.	Ebe dị mma.
The chief is a handsome man.	Onye isi bụ nwoke mara mma.
But that is how it happened.	Ma otu ahụ ka o siri mee.
However, there was a fear in him when they did this.	Otú ọ dị, ihe egwu dị n'ime ya dị mgbe ha mere nke a.
No, better.	Mba, karịa mma.
It’s beautiful in this movie.	Ọ mara mma na ihe nkiri a.
This has happened before.	Nke a mere na mbụ.
It is not there.	Ọ dịghị ebe ahụ.
I like small moments.	Ọ na-amasị m obere oge.
I knew they would not be like my father.	Ama m na ha agaghị adị ka nna m.
Now it can be anyone.	Ugbu a ọ nwere ike ịbụ onye ọ bụla.
I want if the situation is only for one type.	Achọrọ m ma ọ bụrụ na ọnọdụ naanị maka otu ụdị.
On their own.	N'onwe ha.
You are now rested, with others.	Ị zuru ike ugbu a, gị na ndị ọzọ.
The language is clear.	Asụsụ ahụ doro anya.
This is not the case.	Nke a abụghị otú ahụ.
I saw it.	Ahụrụ m ya.
I was skeptical about the condition of the ship.	Enwere m obi abụọ banyere ọnọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
I miss him so much.	A na m atụ uche ya nke ukwuu.
I have a clear mind.	Enwere m uche doro anya.
Nothing like that will ever happen to you again.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ ga-eme gị ọzọ.
His team arrived yesterday morning.	Ndị otu ya rutere n'ụtụtụ ụnyaahụ.
Another way is better.	Ụzọ ọzọ ka mma.
He had no time.	O nweghị oge.
But no one knows how to do anything about it.	Ma ọ dịghị onye maara otú e si eme ihe ọ bụla banyere ya.
Another challenge.	Ọzọ ihe ịma aka ọzọ.
Of course, there is a way to work on this.	N'ezie, e nwere ụzọ na-arụ ọrụ na nke a.
The opinions of others are irrelevant.	Echiche nke ndị ọzọ adịghị mkpa.
And the rest, as they say, is history.	Na ndị ọzọ, dị ka ha na-ekwu, bụ akụkọ ihe mere eme.
And they went to the country.	Ha wee gaa mba.
Many students dropped out this year.	Ọtụtụ ụmụ akwụkwọ kwụsịrị n'afọ a.
That is not the best idea.	Nke ahụ abụghị echiche kacha mma.
He immediately left us.	Ọ hapụrụ anyị ozugbo ahụ.
Everything went well.	Ihe niile gara nke ọma.
There is beauty in all that.	Enwere mma na ihe ahụ niile.
But he drank.	Ma ọ na-aṅụ mmanya.
This is my first question.	Nke a bụ ajụjụ mbụ m.
Maybe it’s time to do something else, something to fear.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ oge ime ihe ọzọ, ihe na-atụ egwu.
But they both work well.	Mana ha abụọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Another perfect place.	Ebe ọzọ zuru oke.
Things are different	Ihe dị iche iche dị iche iche
Big problem.	Nnukwu nsogbu.

Not everyone wants to know who they are.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla chọrọ ka onye ọ bụla mara onye ha bụ.
For many people, that is a far cry.	Nye ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ, nke ahụ dị anya.
But it always does not matter.	Ma mgbe niile ọ dịghị mkpa.
They do not belong to him.	Ha abụghị nke ya.
There are many questions.	Enwere ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
Do you know these plans?	Ị maara atụmatụ ndị a?
But it did.	Ma o mere.
These pictures deserve more than words.	Foto ndị a kwesịrị karịa ikwu okwu.
They are his ideas, not mine.	Ha bụ echiche ya, ọ bụghị nke m.
Enjoy your holiday.	Nwee obi ụtọ ụbọchị ezumike gị.
He does not seem to care about the problems his students face.	O yighị ka o nweghị mmasị na nsogbu ụmụ akwụkwọ ya nwoke.
It was definitely a really nice dinner.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ezigbo nri abalị mara mma.
They are all very beautiful.	Ha niile mara mma nke ukwuu.
No physical problems, he told me.	Enweghị nsogbu anụ ahụ, ọ gwara m.
You can't do this every other week.	Ị nweghị ike ime nke a kwa izu ọzọ.
However, the day is beautiful.	Otú ọ dị, ụbọchị mara mma.
I want a comfortable place to stay.	Achọrọ m ebe dị mma ịnọ.
Now they are just like fools.	Ugbu a, ha dị nnọọ ka ndị nzuzu.
Let me stay there.	Ka m nọrọ ebe ahụ.
It has something different.	O nwere ihe dị iche.
That’s what everyone is doing here.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe onye ọ bụla na-eme ebe a.
Only a woman is known.	Naanị nwanyị ka a maara.
He left.	Ọ pụọ.
Some of them have health problems.	Ụfọdụ n’ime ha nwere nsogbu ahụ́ ike.
We know how it is.	Anyị maara otú ọ dị.
They are afraid of doing bad things.	Ha na-atụ egwu ime ihe ọjọọ.
No, it's more beautiful.	Mba, ọ mara mma karịa.
But that time is very long.	Mana ogologo oge ahụ dị ezigbo anya.
They looked at each other for a long time.	Ha lere ibe ha anya ruo ogologo oge.
We are here all our lives.	Anyị nọ ebe a ndụ anyị niile.
Let us have the same hope.	Ka anyị nwee olileanya otú ahụ.
The couple is happy.	Di na nwunye ahụ nwere obi ụtọ.

It will not be a few days.	Ọ gaghị abụ ụbọchị ole na ole.
No one told me anything like you.	Ọ dịghị onye gwara m ihe dị ka gị.

We can't have a job.	Anyị enweghị ike inwe ọrụ.
Well, we got it.	Ọ dị mma, anyị nwetara ya.
They are not in my shoes.	Ha anọghị na akpụkpọ ụkwụ m.

Some more than many.	Ụfọdụ karịa ọtụtụ.
He knew what to do.	Ọ maara ihe e kwesịrị ime.
This is a challenge he knows will come.	Nke a bụ ihe ịma aka ọ ma na ọ ga-abịa.
Very clear to me.	Nke ukwuu doro m anya.
But for dinner.	Ma maka nri abalị.
I do not want to be.	Achọghị m ịbụ.
He knew why he had come.	Ọ ma ihe mere o ji bịa.

However, she did not feel well.	Otú ọ dị, ahụ adịghị ya mma.

He will travel a long way.	Ọ ga-eme njem dị anya.
As soon as he caught sight of her, he wondered.	Ozugbo ọ hụrụ anya ya, ọ tụrụ ya ajụjụ n'anya.
I never stopped doing both.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m kwụsịrị ime ha abụọ.
Someone who is important today may not be important tomorrow.	Onye dị mkpa taa nwere ike ọ gaghị adị mkpa echi.

And that was expected that we others would not do.	Na na a tụrụ anya na anyị ndị ọzọ agaghị eme.

An hour and ten minutes will go.	Otu awa na nkeji iri ga-aga.
The food and the service were excellent.	Nri na ọrụ ahụ mara oke mma.
Sometimes lies are not true.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ụgha abụghị ụgha.
Now, I’m pretty sure you don’t play these games.	Ugbu a, o doro m anya na ị naghị eme egwuregwu ndị a.

At its best it is funny.	Ihe kacha mma ya na-atọ ọchị.

She does not seem to know herself.	O yiri ka ọ maghị onwe ya.
For us, that sounds like a simple thing.	Maka anyị, nke ahụ dị ka ihe dị mfe.

For one thing, the students evidently went astray.	Otu, o doro anya na ụmụ akwụkwọ ahụ mere ihe ọjọọ.

They continue on this path.	Ha gara n'ihu na-aga n'ụzọ a.

Maybe they are wise.	Ma eleghị anya, ha maara ihe.
But it's the same way.	Ma ọ bụ otu ụzọ ahụ.
Stop the story immediately.	Kwụsị akụkọ ozugbo.
Give it to me well.	Nye m ya nke ọma.
In his life.	Na ndụ ya.

There is no such thing.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ.

He finds himself here.	Ọ hụrụ onwe ya ebe a.
Everyone wants to be successful.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ inwe ihe ịga nke ọma.
The first thing they want is a reasonable one.	Ihe mbụ ha chọrọ bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
Take it and take it.	Were ya were ya.
He will not do anything.	Ọ gaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.
This is a question of both law and truth.	Nke a bụ ajụjụ ma iwu ma eziokwu.
During this time, all of its food is eaten cold.	N'oge a, a na-eri nri ya niile oyi.
It’s one of my favorite things to do.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ihe kacha amasị m ime.

Of course your home is yours.	N'ezie ụlọ gị bụ nke gị.

That makes us run the game faster.	Nke ahụ na-eme ka anyị na-agba ọsọ ọsọ nke egwuregwu ahụ.
It could be anything, that’s what they say.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọ bụla, nke ahụ bụ ihe ha na-ekwu.
Go to the girl.	Gaa nwa agbọghọ.
But the issue is still money.	Ma okwu ahụ ka bụ ego.
He gave her the book.	O nyere ya akwụkwọ ahụ.
None of my girlfriends died.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ndị enyi m nwanyị nwụrụ.
But that will not happen suddenly by the way.	Mana nke ahụ agaghị eme na mberede n'ụzọ.
He needs to be with her now.	O kwesịrị ka ya na ya nọrọ ugbu a.
Then give it to me.	Mgbe ahụ nye m ya.

Face-to-face, it's better.	Ihu na ihu, ọ ka mma.

This woman is afraid of this man.	Nwanyị a tụrụ egwu nwoke a.

You need to see how she dresses.	I kwesịrị ịhụ otú o si agba uwe.

Her clothes are awesome.	Uwe ya dị egwu.
One of the patients died.	Otu n'ime ndị ọrịa ahụ nwụrụ.

This is not a trivial matter.	Nke a abụghị ihe dị egwu.

But at the time, that was our last thought.	Ma, n'oge ahụ, nke ahụ bụ ihe ikpeazụ anyị na-eche.
He said once.	O kwuru otu oge.

Sometimes it happens only once in our lives.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ na-eme naanị otu ugboro na ndụ anyị.

That was the man you met yesterday.	Nke ahụ bụ nwoke ahụ ị zutere ụnyahụ.
Being prepared for anything is a good idea.	Ịdị njikere maka ihe ọ bụla bụ ezigbo echiche.
Another old work.	Ọrụ ochie ọzọ.

He did his homework even though it was not fun.	O mere ihe omume ụlọ ya n’agbanyeghị na ọ dịghị ụtọ.

We don't want to see it again.	Anyị achọghị ịhụ ya ọzọ.

Now your situation is worse.	Ugbu a ọnọdụ gị ka njọ.
He blamed his wife for the problem.	Ọ kwuru na ọ bụ nwunye ya kpatara nsogbu ahụ.
People drink more water than they should.	Ndị mmadụ na-aṅụ mmiri karịa ka ha kwesịrị.
They want to know if they have a boyfriend.	Ha chọrọ ịma ma ọ̀ nwere enyi nwoke.

Here is the only way to do this or that.	Ebe a bụ naanị ụzọ ị ga-esi mee nke a ma ọ bụ nke ahụ.
Which is probably good.	Nke dị mma ma eleghị anya.
He soon became independent.	N'oge na-adịghị anya ọ nwere onwe ya.
Still, they needed more information.	Ma n'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ha chọrọ ozi ndị ọzọ.
Cars are bad.	Ụgbọ ala bụ ihe ọjọọ.

The car suddenly stopped.	Ụgbọala ahụ kwụsịrị na mberede.

No more information available.	Enweghị ozi ọzọ dị.
He looked around the hall.	O lere anya gburugburu ụlọ nzukọ ahụ.

I'm not sure if that's what you want.	Ejighị m n'aka ma nke ahụ bụ ihe ị chọrọ.
But he doesn't want to talk to anyone.	Ma ọ chọghị ịgwa onye ọ bụla okwu.
He bought her a gift.	Ọ zụtara ya onyinye.
You know how it goes.	Ị ma ka ọ na-aga.
It will require more power than its own.	Ọ ga-achọ ike dị ukwuu karịa nke ya.
But those kinds of colors would be, he had no idea.	Ma ụdị agba ndị ahụ ga-abụ, ọ nweghị echiche.
He always had a good smile.	Ọ na-enwe ihu ọchị mgbe niile.
Most people move forward on their own.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-aga n'ihu n'isi ha.
Beautiful city.	Obodo mara mma.
Our time now, now, is a unique situation.	Oge anyị ugbu a, ugbu a, bụ ọnọdụ pụrụ iche.
There is something surrounding it for what happened.	Enwere ihe gbara ya gburugburu maka ihe merenụ.
It is an idea.	Ọ bụ echiche.
However, it is worth it.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bara uru.
He went fast.	Ọ gara ngwa ngwa.
No doubt, he enjoyed it.	O doro anya na ihe a na-atọ ya ụtọ.
Towers are a huge asset to any community.	Ụlọ elu bara nnukwu uru nye obodo ọ bụla.
Give them a little time if they want it.	Nye ha obere oge ma ọ bụrụ na ha chọrọ ya.
I wondered what else they would want.	M nọ na-eche ihe ọzọ ha ga-achọ.
Everyone is on the same page.	Onye ọ bụla nọ n'otu ibe.
So confident, strong, and therefore independent.	Ya mere obi ike, dị ike, ya mere na onwe ha.

That's my phone.	Nke ahụ bụ ekwentị m.
But she will not hear it.	Ma ọ gaghị anụ ya.
She was a little scared.	Ọ tụrụ ya egwu ntakịrị.

Maybe he should move on.	Ma eleghị anya, o kwesịrị ịga n'ihu.

Get this man to do something to you.	Mee ka nwoke a mee gị ihe.
You will not do that.	Ị gaghị eme nke ahụ.
That's the worst.	Nke ahụ kacha njọ.

But please make sure you do not eat.	Ma biko hụ na ị naghị eri nri.
No, that is a bad idea.	Mba, nke ahụ bụ echiche ọjọọ.

How we do these things is important.	Otú anyị si eme ihe ndị a dị mkpa.
But he didn't want me.	Ma ọ chọghị m.
Everyone was speaking in their own language.	Onye ọ bụla nọ na-ekwu okwu mgbe asụsụ ha na-adịghị.

We don't like to think that he thinks too much.	Ọ naghị amasị anyị iche na ọ na-eche ọtụtụ ihe.

He saw her in the distance and said good-bye.	Ọ hụrụ ya n’ebe dị anya, wee sị nke ọma.

Over the years.	N'ime ọtụtụ afọ.
If I had not.	A sị m na ha enweghị.
Nothing special, here.	Ọ nweghị ihe pụrụ iche, ebe a.
Long ago, of course.	Ogologo oge gara aga, n'ezie.
Musicians play well.	Ndị egwu egwu na-egwu nke ọma.
None of us are the women we want to be.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị bụ ụmụ nwanyị anyị chọrọ ịbụ.
Their son's birthday was last month.	Ụbọchị ọmụmụ nwa ha nwoke bụ n'ọnwa gara aga.
Temperature is not really a big deal.	Ọnọdụ okpomọkụ abụghị n'ezie nnukwu ihe.
That is very good.	Nke ahụ bụ ezigbo mma.
The weather is very cold.	Ihu igwe dị nnọọ oyi.
They occur only when he is near the person who has the gift.	Ha na-eme naanị mgbe ọ nọ nso onye nwere onyinye ahụ.
He understood it well.	Ọ ghọtara ya nke ọma.
A few photos.	Foto ole na ole.
We want to do it well.	Anyị chọrọ ime ya nke ọma.
He certainly did not seem to be doing anything.	O doro anya na o yighị ka ọ na-eme ihe ọ bụla.
The doctor came with a message.	Dọkịta ahụ ji ozi bịa.
We can use this to help you.	Anyị nwere ike iji nke a nyere gị aka.
She took a small towel.	Ọ were obere akwa akwa.
She is wearing a beautiful dress.	O yi uwe mara mma.
We do this for two main reasons.	Anyị na-eme nke a n'ihi isi ihe abụọ.
But they do worse.	Ma ha na-eme nke ka njọ.
It looks very different.	O yiri nnọọ iche.
He will spend two days in the country.	Ọ ga-anọ ụbọchị abụọ na mba ahụ.
I want him to go away.	Achọrọ m ka ọ pụọ.
There is nothing easier than that.	Ọ dịghị mfe karịa nke ahụ.
But nothing.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe.
There are many different types.	Enwere ụdị dị iche iche dị iche iche.
Hopefully that makes sense.	Olileanya na nke ahụ nwere ezi uche.
But this water.	Ma mmiri a.
He does it well.	Ọ na-eme ya nke ọma.
Of course, they could not.	N'ezie, ha apụghị ime otú ahụ.
Three people were found dead in the water.	Ahụrụ mmadụ atọ nwụrụ n'ime mmiri.
Now, let's decorate.	Ugbu a, ka anyị chọọ mma.
He knew it in his mouth.	Ọ maara n'ọnụ ya.
I can only.	Enwere m ike naanị.
Please stay for a while.	Biko nọrọ nwa oge.
That has a big problem.	Nke ahụ nwere nnukwu nsogbu.
I think it's awesome.	Echere m na ọ dị oke egwu.
The others are very beautiful.	Ndị ọzọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
He goes on and on.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu n'ihe.
We went on the road.	Anyị gara n'ụzọ.
Is that you.	Ọ bụ gị.
In fact, they seem to like it.	N'ezie, o yiri ka ọ masịrị ha.
He is not alone.	Ọ bụghị naanị ya.
I do not understand why someone would steal a car.	Aghọtaghị m ihe mere mmadụ ga-eji zuru ụgbọ ala.
It has only one leg, and one arm.	O nwere naanị otu ụkwụ, na otu aka.
He loved the book.	Ọ hụrụ akwụkwọ ahụ n'anya.
You do not have to be a doctor.	Ị gaghị abụ dọkịta.
It works well sometimes.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma mgbe ụfọdụ.
He looked at his watch.	O lere elekere anya ya.
A city of two.	Obodo mmadụ abụọ.
That was the beginning of the week.	Nke ahụ bụ n'isi izu.
People know each other by name.	Ndị mmadụ ji aha ha mara ibe ha.
These are the members.	Ndị a bụ ndị otu.
The car stopped.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ kwụsịrị.
I do not know what will happen next.	Amaghị m ihe na-aga ime ọzọ.
Dogs are pets.	Nkịta bụ anụ ụlọ.
They are going to end the problem.	Ha na-aga ime ka nsogbu ahụ kwụsị.
Naturally, we are that.	Dị ka o kwesịrị ịdị, anyị bụ nke ahụ.
We are just friends.	Anyị bụ naanị enyi.
But no one else.	Ma ọ dịghị onye ọzọ.
But I feel more than that.	Ma ọ dị m ka ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
He started running.	Ọ malitere ịgba ọsọ.
You want him to do you harm.	Ị chọrọ ka ọ mee gị ihe ọjọọ.
Because they are on summer vacation.	N'ihi na ha nọ na ezumike okpomọkụ.
I bought it from my brother.	M zụtara ya n'aka nwanne m nwoke.
The journalists were outraged.	Iwe were ndị nta akụkọ.
But now that the time is here, it comes really easy.	Ma ugbu a na oge bụ ebe a, ọ na-abịa n'ezie mfe.
The ground is very cold.	Ala dị oke oyi.
We should eat small meals or eat snacks.	Anyị kwesịrị iri obere nri ma ọ bụ na-eri nri.
Of course, that would never happen.	N'ezie, nke ahụ agaghị eme ma ọlị.
For some people, it is a home.	Maka ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ, ọ bụ ụlọ.
The music stopped.	Ndị egwu egwu kwụsịrị.
The reason no one else did it.	Ihe kpatara na ọ nweghị onye ọzọ mere karịrị ya.
This company is small.	Ụlọ ọrụ a dị obere.
I wish he was here.	Ọ dị m ka ya bụrụ na ọ nọ ebe a.
Maybe it's something else.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
They run with locals of color.	Ha na-agba ndị obodo ndị nwere agba agba.
We have friends.	Anyị nwere ndị enyi.
We just wanted there.	Anyị chọrọ naanị ebe ahụ.
I know it will happen.	Ama m na ọ ga-eme.
Probably so with rural girls.	Ma eleghị anya, otú ahụ ka ụmụ agbọghọ ime obodo dị.
I can smell it.	Enwere m ike isi isi ya.
Now she’s interested.	Ugbu a, o nwere mmasị.
The best gift.	Onyinye kacha mma.
People spoke.	Ndị mmadụ kwuru okwu.

The only thing he wanted to go home.	Naanị ihe ọ chọrọ ịla n'ụlọ.
Just did not understand.	Naanị aghọtaghị.
What are we talking about?	Gịnị ka anyị na-ekwu?
Swimming is a tough sport.	Igwu mmiri bụ egwuregwu siri ike.
You are precious.	Ị dị oke ọnụ ahịa.
It just was there.	Ọ bụ naanị na ọ dị ebe ahụ.
This girl is swimming like a fish.	Nwa agbọghọ a na-egwu mmiri ka azụ.
The police stopped them.	Ndị uwe ojii kwụsịrị ha.
You have a few minutes.	Ị nwere nkeji ole na ole.
Obviously, the man could not do much about it.	O doro anya na nwoke ahụ enweghị ike ime ọtụtụ ihe gbasara ya.
I love school.	Enwere m mmasị na ụlọ akwụkwọ.
I did not, of course.	Emeghị m, n'ezie.
He thought he would do it.	O chere na ya ga-eme ya.
Made of wood?	Eji osisi mee ya?
But the city would be better off.	Mana obodo ahụ ga-amasị karịa.
But it is very beautiful.	Ma ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
One big reason is health.	Otu nnukwu ihe kpatara ya bụ n'ihi ahụ ike.
My parents were very angry.	Nne na nna m were iwe nke ukwuu.
The river is beautiful.	Osimiri mara mma.
I need money fast.	Achọrọ m ego ngwa ngwa.
That's it.	Ọ bụ ya bụ ya.
We know their judgment.	Anyị maara ikpe ha.
His mother pushed him back.	Nne ya mara ya azụ.
We did.	Anyị mere.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
This is the second time this has been done.	Nke a bụ nke ugboro abụọ ihe a na-eme.
We all thought we could have any woman we wanted.	Anyị niile chere na anyị nwere ike inwe nwanyị ọ bụla anyị chọrọ.
No, it was not his night.	Mba, ọ bụghị abalị ya.
It's just awesome.	Ọ bụ naanị egwu.
Many have their own home.	Ọtụtụ nwere ụlọ nke ha.
He wants things to go their way.	Ọ chọrọ ka ihe na-aga otú ha dị.
A nearby market.	Otu ahịa dị nso.
He told her to stay in the room.	Ọ gwara ya ka ọ nọrọ n’ọnụ ụlọ.
In each of them.	Na nke ọ bụla n'ime ha.
I think that's good.	Echere m na nke ahụ dị mma.
Some books are more expensive than others.	Akwụkwọ ụfọdụ dị ọnụ karịa ndị ọzọ.
I do that.	M na-eme nke ahụ.
I would like any help.	Ọ ga-amasị m enyemaka ọ bụla.
This customer likes to say bad things.	Onye ahịa a na-enwe mmasị ikwu ihe ọjọọ.
I am happy for them.	Enwere m obi ụtọ maka ha.
But the president is ready.	Mana onye isi ala dị njikere.
I saw it here.	Ahụrụ m ya ebe a.
We traveled for several days to reach the village.	Anyị gara ọtụtụ ụbọchị iji ruo obodo nta ahụ.
We need to help.	Anyị kwesịrị inyere aka.
They said we needed help.	Ha kwuru na anyị chọrọ enyemaka.
This year seems to be no different.	Afọ a yiri ka ọ dịghị iche.
The project was successful.	Ọrụ ahụ gara nke ọma.
Cry for help.	Mkpu maka enyemaka.
I really hate this man.	Ahụrụ m nwoke a asị n'ezie.
It is almost the same.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ otu.
We all know that this movie is a lie.	Anyị niile maara na ihe nkiri a bụ ụgha.
Almost all marine life is in danger.	Ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ndụ mmiri niile nọ n'ihe egwu.
We are really doing something about it.	Anyị na-eme ihe banyere ya n'ezie.
Anger and fear he understood.	Iwe na egwu ọ ghọtara.
This is good.	Nke a dị mma.
This is impossible.	Nke a enweghị ike ime.
We are not alone.	Ọ bụghị naanị anyị.
Not a lot, that's for sure.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ, nke ahụ bụ n'ezie.
You can really do it.	Ị nwere ike ime ya n'ezie.
He is our son.	Ọ bụ nwa anyị nwoke.
However, this is around the point.	Otú ọ dị, nke a dị n'akụkụ isi ihe.
He has no plans now.	O nweghị atụmatụ ugbu a.
It will be now.	Ọ ga-adị ugbu a.
Good job beautiful.	Ezigbo ọrụ mara mma.
They are true to themselves.	Ha bụ eziokwu nye onwe ha.
A friend of mine was with me.	Otu enyi mụ na ya nọ.
He pointed to the policeman.	O mere ka a tụrụ onye uwe ojii ahụ aka.
This is the fight of my life.	Nke a bụ ọgụ nke ndụ m.
He knew he was going to do it fast.	Ọ maara na ọ ga-eme ngwa ngwa.
The climate of the city has a large tower.	Ihu igwe nke obodo ahụ nwere nnukwu ụlọ elu.
Or, that's how it is.	Ma ọ bụ, nke ahụ bụ otú ọ dị.
But it does not make it easy.	Mana ọ naghị eme ka ọ dị mfe.
And he ate it.	O wee rie ya.
The two rooms are similar.	Ime ụlọ abụọ ahụ yiri otu ihe.
That is more than a little new.	Nke ahụ karịrị ntakịrị ihe ọhụrụ.
Big big guys.	Nnukwu ndị nwoke siri ike.
Lots and lots of women.	Ọtụtụ na ọtụtụ ụmụ nwanyị.
He did not want to leave the house.	Ọ chọghị ịpụ n'ụlọ ahụ.
Any event is important or impossible.	Ihe omume ọ bụla dị mkpa ma ọ bụ agaghị ekwe omume.
Boys are like kids.	Ụmụ nwoke dị ka ụmụaka.
These are good times.	Oge ndị a bụ ezigbo oge.
We did our fast.	Anyị mere ngwa ngwa anyị.
He told police he was the victim.	Ọ gwara onye uwe ojii na ọ bụ ya bụ onye ihe ahụ mere.
The dining area is limited in this area.	Ebe a na-eri nri nwere oke n'akụkụ a.
These do not.	Ndị a adịghị.
Another time, he thought.	Otu oge ọzọ, o chere.
This is good.	Nke a dị mma.
He ran away.	Ọ gbara ya ọsọ.
There is no problem with this.	Enweghị nsogbu ọ bụla na nke a.
He wants to move on with things.	Ọ chọrọ ịga n'ihu na ihe.
Either way, there will be no more meal time today.	Kedu ụzọ ọ bụla, a gaghị enwe oge nri nri ọzọ taa.
Most people do not.	Ọtụtụ ndị anaghị eme ya.
They don't hear us, man.	Ha anaghị anụ anyị, nwoke.
It looks beautiful.	Ọ dị ka ọ mara mma.
Few, of course.	Ole na ole, n'ezie.
Do it just for that.	Ime ya naanị n'ihi na.
I do not know the company it is.	Amaghị m ụlọ ọrụ ọ bụ.
She has one son.	O nwere otu nwa nwoke.
She lives in a beautiful house.	O bi n'ụlọ mara mma.
So we went for that.	Ya mere, anyị gara na nke ahụ.
He can not swim.	Ọ nweghị ike igwu mmiri.
One who always feels good.	Onye na-enwe mmetụta dị mma mgbe niile.
I have no way to say.	Enweghị m ụzọ ikwu.
Not that the sun is high.	Ọ bụghị na anwụ dị ukwuu.
I was at work every day.	Anọ m n'ụlọ ọrụ kwa ụbọchị.
We gave birth to our first child, along with someone else on the way.	Anyị mụrụ nwa mbụ anyị, ya na onye ọzọ nọ n'ụzọ.
Did he really travel?	Ị mere njem n'ezie?
Of course, many people came here by boat.	N’ezie, ọtụtụ mmadụ ji ụgbọ mmiri bịa ebe a.
There will be.	A ga-enwe.
Or it looks like that.	Ma ọ bụ ọ dị ka nke ahụ.
Maybe that's still possible.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ ka kwere omume.
I am not a man.	Abụghị m mmadụ.
A day or two, that's all.	Otu ụbọchị ma ọ bụ abụọ, nke ahụ bụ naanị.
We are the ones we know.	Anyị bụ ndị anyị maara.
This is the perfect time.	Nke a bụ oge zuru oke.
Her smile stopped.	Ọmụmụ ọnụ ọchị ya kwụsịrị.
Be prepared to leave.	Dị njikere ịpụ.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ihe si dị.
Many other things can be done.	Enwere ike ime ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ.
It should not be too strong.	E kwesịghị ịdị oke ike.
You will not see any of those things.	Ị gaghị ahụ nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị ahụ.
I’m going to see them play every summer.	M na-aga hụ ka ha na-egwu egwu n'oge okpomọkụ ọ bụla.
They are happy tears, by the way.	Ha bụ anya mmiri obi ụtọ, n'ụzọ.
He wanted a better life.	Ọ chọrọ ka ndụ dị mma.
But he was better than anyone else.	Ma ọ dị mma karịa onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
Maybe I need it but it doesn't really matter.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị m mkpa ma ọ dịghị mkpa n'ezie.
Are you okay now?	Ị dị mma ugbu a?
That can be almost a disease.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ọrịa.
His friends hope he is telling the truth.	Ndị enyi ya nwere olileanya na ọ na-ekwu eziokwu.
The city is known for its books.	E ji akwụkwọ ya mara obodo ahụ.
At that time, the night fell.	N'oge ahụ, abalị dara.
He was amazed at the behavior of his colleagues.	Omume ndị ọrụ ibe ya tụrụ ya n’anya.
Everything is new.	Ihe niile dị ọhụrụ.
And up some others.	Na elu ụfọdụ ndị ọzọ.
Without history, there is no danger.	Na-enweghị akụkọ ihe mere eme, ọ dịghị ihe egwu.
It will never happen the other way around.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-eme n'ụzọ ọzọ gburugburu.
There are no windows.	O nweghị windo.
Each month is different.	Kwa ọnwa dị iche.
It is not a job.	Ọ bụghị ọrụ.
None of this is appealing.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a mara ya mma.
No, it is not.	Mba, ọ bụghị ya.
But that is no small matter.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị obere ihe.
The river is beautiful.	Osimiri mara mma.
But let me tell you - it was the best.	Ma ka m gwa gị, ọ kacha mma.
That is his way.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ ụzọ ya.
One year has no major impact.	Otu afọ enweghị mmetụta bụ isi.
He ate my coffee.	Ọ riri kọfị m.
I love your work.	Enwere m mmasị na ọrụ gị.
Are you satisfied with the food?	Afọ juru gị na nri ahụ?
That is the other group.	Nke ahụ bụ otu ndị ọzọ.
He called him a fool.	Ọ kpọrọ ya onye nzuzu.
We work as a team here.	Anyị na-arụ ọrụ dị ka otu ebe a.
You know most of the people.	Ị maara ọtụtụ n'ime ndị mmadụ.
That is bad news for the student.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ọjọọ nye nwa akwụkwọ ahụ.
This is so much better.	Nke a ka nnọọ mma.
But sometimes he knows it's not a game.	Ma n'oge ụfọdụ ọ maara na ọ bụghị egwuregwu.
Of course, no one else but him.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị onye ọzọ ma ọ bụghị ya.
Sometimes they do.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha na-eme.
No one is dead.	Ọ dịghị onye nwụrụ anwụ.
You take this for granted.	Ị were nke a n'ezie.
Or your body.	Ma ọ bụ ahụ gị.
He does it when one wants it.	Ọ na-eme ya mgbe otu chọrọ ya.
Not everything.	Ọ bụghị ihe niile.
Mine is not such a case.	Nke m abụghị ụdị ikpe ahụ.
You will get out of the machine through this machine path.	Ị ga-esi na igwe igwe pụọ site n'ụzọ igwe a.
I have no time to argue.	Enweghị m oge ịgba ụka.
This game is very well known about me.	Egwuregwu a maara nke ukwuu banyere m.
Then you can go out and do whatever you want.	Mgbe ahụ ị nwere ike pụọ mee ihe ọ bụla masịrị gị.
The reason.	Ihe kpatara ya.
We love the house.	Anyị hụrụ ụlọ ahụ n'anya.
You do the same thing.	Ị na-eme otu ihe ahụ ha mere.
What is your favorite color?	Kedu agba kacha amasị gị?
There is a head, but there is a hand.	E nwere isi, ma e nwere aka.
Things will not just look the same.	Ihe agaghị adị nnọọ ka ọ dị adị.
All your friends will be there.	Ndị enyi gị niile ga-anọ ebe ahụ.
This school will be your destination soon.	Ụlọ akwụkwọ a ga-abụ ebe ị ga-aga n'oge na-adịghị.
We talk every few days, if not often.	Anyị na-ekwu okwu kwa ụbọchị ole na ole, ma ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị ọtụtụ mgbe.
They think of everything, sometimes too much.	Ha na-eche ihe niile, mgbe ụfọdụ na oke.
Laughter fell in the room.	Ọchị dara n'ime ụlọ.
Stupid name, we know.	Aha nzuzu, anyị maara.
Or so it will be.	Ma ọ bụ otú ọ ga-adị.
But you know this is not how we go.	Mana ị ma na nke a abụghị ka anyị si aga.
The reason is clear.	O doro anya ihe kpatara ya.
No, he thinks.	Enweghị ike, ọ na-eche.
That is different from having success.	Nke ahụ dị iche na inwe ihe ịga nke ọma.
They hated him.	Ha kpọrọ ya asị.
I do not want to go.	Achọghị m ịga.
He could not leave the house.	Ọ nweghị ike ịpụ n'ụlọ.
I can't know if it's a boy or a girl.	Apụghị m ịma ma ọ̀ bụ nwoke ma ọ bụ nwa agbọghọ.
We will do this as soon as the meeting begins.	Anyị ga-eme nke a ozugbo nzukọ ahụ malitere.
My ____ is stiff.	M siri ike.
I do not understand any of it.	Aghọtaghị m nke ọ bụla n'ime ya.
He did not know.	Ọ maghị.
Some have been successful, while others have failed.	Ụfọdụ nwere ihe ịga nke ọma, ebe ndị ọzọ dara.
Maybe he should go to one.	Ma eleghị anya, o kwesịrị ịga otu.
And a few more.	Na ole na ole ndị ọzọ.
The food is good.	Nri dị mma.
Your time will come soon.	Oge gị ga-abịa ngwa ngwa.
But there are no new ones.	Ma o nweghị ndị ọhụrụ ọ bụla.
Until a few years ago, this was a small town.	Ruo afọ ole na ole gara aga, nke a bụ obere obodo.
It seems that both of you are good friends.	O yiri ka unu abụọ na-enwe ezigbo enyi.
As soon as he could, he saw it again.	Ozugbo o nwere ike, ọ hụrụ ya ọzọ.
It has a big house.	Ọ nwere nnukwu ụlọ.
People stopped working.	Ndị mmadụ kwụsịrị ọrụ.
Such a place is at my price.	Ụdị ebe ahụ dị na ọnụ ahịa m.
Boys like it.	Ụmụ nwoke masịrị ya.
Maybe it can help.	Eleghị anya nwere ike inye aka.
Today, however, the effect is quite different.	Otú ọ dị, mmetụta nke taa dị nnọọ iche.
The temperature is much better.	Ọnọdụ okpomọkụ dị mma karịa.
We will all be there.	Anyị niile ga-anọ ebe ahụ.
I am alone with you.	Enwere m naanị gị.
We got it.	Anyị nwetara ya.
They are really acting.	Ha na-eme ihe nkiri n'ezie.
Today, such places are unknown.	Taa, a maghị ebe ndị dị otú ahụ.
What kind of them.	Kedu ụdị ha.
There is no rest.	Enweghị izu ike.
So do we need more water?	Ya mere, anyị chọrọ mmiri ọzọ?
They are the successes they have achieved.	Ha bụ ndị ihe ịga nke ọma nke ha nwetara.
Probably not, 'he said.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị,' ka o kwuru.
Doctors work hard.	Ndị dọkịta na-arụ ọrụ siri ike.
Not here.	Ọ bụghị ebe a.
He looked at me intently.	O lere m anya nke ọma.
Mental state is physical condition.	Ọnọdụ uche bụ ọnọdụ anụ ahụ.
I would never do that.	Agaghị m eme ụdị ihe ahụ.
Not now.	Ọ bụghị ugbu a.
The food was delicious.	Nri ahụ dị ụtọ.
Not just for the things you want.	Ọ bụghị naanị maka ihe ndị ị chọrọ.
I'm doing well.	A na m eme nke ọma.
Last year, it was hard to find anything positive.	N'afọ gara aga, ọ siri ike ịchọta ihe dị mma.
I really want to rest.	M n'ezie ka m zuru ike.
It's so delicious.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
I’m sure both will be fine.	Eji m n'aka na ha abụọ ga-adị mma.
You have more than one.	Ị nwere karịa otu.
He is afraid.	Ọ tụrụ ya ụjọ.
The truth should be so.	Eziokwu kwesịrị ịdị otú ahụ.
And last year it was bad.	Na afọ gara aga ọ dị njọ.
Otherwise, it looks good.	Ma ọ bụghị, ọ dị ka ọ dị mma.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
But not for him.	Ma, ọ bụghị nye ya.
Give him anything, he can play it.	Nye ya ihe ọ bụla, ọ nwere ike igwu ya.
I can go anywhere, do anything.	Enwere m ike ịga ebe ọ bụla, mee ihe ọ bụla.
Just really stupid.	Naanị ihe nzuzu n'ezie.
News happened his day.	Akụkọ mere ụbọchị ya.
It was a difficult time at that time.	Oge siri ike n'oge ahụ.
It is very different from most students.	Ọ dị nnọọ iche na ọtụtụ ụmụ akwụkwọ.
It cost a lot of money.	Ọ gbara nnukwu ego.
No space for anyone.	Enweghị ohere maka onye ọ bụla.
We went to his house.	Anyị gara n'ụlọ ya.
The law is there.	Iwu dị ebe ahụ.
Na na na.	Na na na.
You can't do anything wrong.	Ị nweghị ike ime ihe ọjọọ ọ bụla.
Many people saw this accident.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ hụrụ ihe mberede a.
Summer is near.	Oge okpomọkụ dị nso.
They have this feeling.	Ha nwere mmetụta nke a.
He told us not to be angry.	Ọ gwara anyị ka anyị ghara iwe iwe.
There are two possible reasons.	E nwere ihe abụọ kpatara ya.
This picture is like us!	Foto a dị ka anyị!
She loved this picture.	Ọ hụrụ foto a n'anya.
You can think of it with fabric.	Ị nwere ike iche banyere ya na akwa.
That sounds good.	Nke ahụ dị ka ọ dị mma.
The police road is difficult.	Ụzọ ndị uwe ojii siri ike.
Come to my wine party!	Bịa na oriri mmanya m!
I never wanted you.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chọrọ gị.
Why is this the case?	Gịnị mere o ji dị otú a.

Because you are waiting for it.	N'ihi na ị na-eche ya.
At the port.	N'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri.

You live here.	Ị bi ebe a.
When the time comes to play.	Mgbe oge na-abịa egwuregwu.

You do not go from that quickly forward.	Ị naghị esi na nke ahụ gaa n'ihu ngwa ngwa.

The headline is awesome.	Isi ahụ dị egwu.
He looked out the window.	O lere anya na windo.
I can be anyone.	Enwere m ike ịbụ onye ọ bụla.
Their plan is very simple.	Atụmatụ ha dị nnọọ mfe.
Their car is super fast!	Ụgbọ ala ha dị oke ọsọ!
I think that requires a break.	Echere m na nke ahụ chọrọ ezumike.
That is an immediate matter.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe gbasara ozugbo.
What a fool to say.	Kedu ihe nzuzu ikwu.
It's too strong.	O siri ike nke ukwuu.
I asked him questions about many people.	M jụrụ ya ajụjụ gbasara ọtụtụ mmadụ.
This is no small matter.	Nke a abụghị obere ihe.
Hard to believe.	O siri ike ikweta.
I was really scared of everything.	Enwere m ezigbo ụjọ maka ihe niile.
That is very difficult.	Nke ahụ siri ike nke ukwuu.
My father is now.	Nna m bụ ugbu a.
I do not want this to happen to my book.	Achọghị m ka ihe a mee akwụkwọ m.
But this is not for what they want.	Mana nke a abụghị maka ihe ha chọrọ.
He’s a solid soccer player.	Ọ bụ otu onye egwuregwu bọọlụ siri ike.
Never too much rain.	Ọ dịghị mgbe oke mmiri.
I don't care about them.	Achọghị m ịma banyere ha.

The reason may be that he is only in danger.	Ihe kpatara ya nwere ike ịbụ naanị na ọ nọ n'ihe egwu.
My life would have been different.	Ndụ m gaara aga n'ụzọ dị iche.
It may be helpful for those who are currently working.	Ọ nwere ike inye aka maka ndị na-arụ ọrụ ugbu a.
Many new employees suddenly quit.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọrụ ọhụrụ kwụsịrị na mberede.
I knew it right away.	Amaara m ya ozugbo.
Little is known about his personal life.	A maghị ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ gbasara ndụ onwe ya.
The speaker.	Onye na-ekwu okwu.
His health improved.	Ahụ́ ike ya bịara nke ukwuu.
But the problem still exists.	Ma nsogbu ahụ ka dị.
We stopped it.	Anyị kwụsịrị ya.
A few of us.	Anyị ole na ole.
No one was in front of him.	Ọ dịghị onye nọ n'ihu ya.
We entered his room.	Anyị banyere n'ime ụlọ ya.
He looked around the house.	O lere anya gburugburu ụlọ ahụ.
Just my own opinion.	Naanị echiche nke m.
You will not see this.	Ị gaghị ahụ nke a.
I took advantage of the opportunity.	Eji m ohere ahụ mee ihe.
But, of course, they were there.	Ma n'ezie, ha nọ ya n'ebe ahụ.
You're good.	Ị dị mma.
His way is not backward.	Ụzọ ya adịghị ala azụ.
The mind does not exist now.	Uche anaghị adị ugbu a.
So he did not really tell us anything.	N’ihi ya, ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla ọ gwara anyị n’ezie.
He put his hand down.	O tinyere aka ya ala.
But there is more.	Ma e nwere ihe ndị ọzọ.
You do not know that you will live.	Ị maghị na ị ga-adị ndụ.
Nothing can be done about it.	Ọ dịghị ihe ga-eme banyere ya.
They were drinking.	Ha nọ na-aṅụ mmanya.
No interview took place.	Enweghị ajụjụ ọnụ mere.
My wife did everything.	Nwunye m mere ihe niile.
We do everything here.	Anyị na-eme ihe niile ebe a.
No, they say, you are doing well.	Mba, ha kwuru, ị na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.

When nothing happened, he tried again.	Mgbe ọ dịghị ihe mere, ọ gbalịrị ọzọ.
There are many good reasons for you to be a vegetarian.	Enwere ọtụtụ ezigbo ihe mere ị ga-eji bụrụ onye anaghị eri anụ.
He was a simple man with a simple sense of humor.	Ọ bụ nwoke dị mfe nke nwere obi ụtọ dị mfe.
He is the source of all this.	Ọ bụ ya bụ isi ihe a niile.
I want you to tell me that you are human now.	Achọrọ m ka ị gwa m na ị bụ mmadụ ugbu a.
We never did.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị mere.

Unfortunately he asked his girlfriend.	Ọ dị njọ na ọ jụrụ enyi ya nwanyị.
It is night and day.	O si n'abalị ruo n'ehihie ọzọ.
This is something new.	Nke a bụ ihe ọhụrụ.
I love the girl.	Ahụrụ m nwa agbọghọ ahụ n'anya.
This is not about them.	Nke a abụghị gbasara ha.
There is a reason for that.	Enwere ihe kpatara nke ahụ.
I can't do this.	Enweghị m ike ime nke a.
But that is not the worst.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị nke kacha njọ.
Sometimes it makes it worse.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ na-eme ka ọ ka njọ.
Take that opportunity.	Were ohere ahụ.
I can see my legs.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ụkwụ m.
None of us are ready for that.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị dị njikere maka nke ahụ.
In righteousness, and in responsibility.	Na ezi omume, na ibu ọrụ.
One of us will go.	Otu n'ime anyị ga-aga.
I'm sure that could be the case.	Eji m n'aka na nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ ikpe.
The work took several hours.	Arụ ọrụ ahụ were ọtụtụ awa.
There are no family rules.	Enweghị iwu ezinụlọ.
The doctor asked the patient many questions.	Dọkịta ahụ jụrụ onye ọrịa ahụ ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
I think running is not alone.	Echere m na ịgba ọsọ abụghị naanị m.
Stop a little.	Kwụsị ntakịrị.
That may be just my food.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ naanị nri m.
Stop it in your heart.	Kwụsị ya n'obi.
Many people liked it.	Ọ masịrị ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ.
This song, anytime, for you always.	Egwu a, oge ọ bụla, maka gị mgbe niile.
We asked you the first day.	Anyị jụrụ gị ụbọchị mbụ.

The staff was nice and helpful.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ mara mma ma nyere aka.
I hope you have a wonderful trip.	Enwere m olileanya na ị nwere njem dị ụtọ.
A lot of people think around.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-eche gburugburu.
Now, it will be really fun.	Ugbu a, ọ ga-adị ezigbo ụtọ.
We made a promise to each other.	Anyị kwere ibe anyị nkwa.
Emotionally and physically.	N'ụzọ mmetụta uche na anụ ahụ.
But you should tell me this immediately.	Mana ị kwesịrị ịgwa m nke a ozugbo.
Nothing, as he can see.	Ọ dịghị ihe, ka ọ pụrụ ịhụ.

He now knows what will happen.	Ọ maara ugbu a ihe ga-eme.
However, there are other factors involved.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ihe ndị ọzọ dị.
The ball looked at the first few pages.	Bọọlụ lere anya na ibe ole na ole mbụ.
He made a serious case.	O mere ikpe siri ike.
There is no car here to make men look good and strong.	Enweghị ụgbọala ebe a iji mee ka ụmụ nwoke dị mma na ike.
The new store is on the old side.	Ụlọ ahịa ọhụrụ dị n'akụkụ nke ochie.

I do not understand what the problem might be.	Aghọtaghị m ihe nsogbu ahụ nwere ike ịbụ.
The event was awesome.	Ihe omume dị egwu.
The same is not true for every successful woman.	Otu ihe ahụ anaghị adị maka nwanyị ọ bụla na-eme nke ọma.
If that is just hope, there is no hope.	Ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ bụ naanị olileanya, enweghị olileanya.
This may take some time, of course.	Nke a nwere ike iwe obere oge, n'ezie.
In other countries.	Na mba ndị ọzọ.
A small fire broke out in a nearby house.	Obere ọkụ gbara n’ụlọ dị nso.

There is a hard fish head on the dock.	E nwere isi azụ̀ siri ike n’ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
He shot the big game.	Ọ gbara nnukwu egwuregwu ahụ.
One little at a time.	Otu ntakịrị n'otu oge.
Everyone expects you	Onye ọ bụla na-atụ anya gị
They left him.	Ha hapụrụ ya.
Is this true ?.	Nke a ọ bụ eziokwu?.
Here, let me.	Ebe a, ka m.
Either way, this is an important legal battle to have.	Kedu ụzọ ọ bụla, nke a bụ ọgụ iwu dị mkpa inwe.
This is the kind of thing that is dangerous.	Nke a bụ ụdị dị n'ihe egwu.
Our language is spoken.	Asụsụ anyị na-agba.
It is my life, this is my life.	Ọ bụ ndụ m, nke a bụ ndụ m.
Think about children.	Chere echiche maka ụmụaka.
That may be a little off.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ ntakịrị ntakịrị.
If only his words were true.	A sị nnọọ na okwu ya bụ eziokwu.
Something that will let you know that they will happen.	Ihe ga-eme ka ị mara na ha ga-eme.
Thank you for doing all you can from me.	Daalụ maka ime ike gị niile site na m.
It’s kind of funny.	Ọ bụ ụdị ọchị.
This has been our long-standing practice.	Nke a bụ omume ogologo oge anyị.
Most people are powerless but powerless.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ enweghị ike ma ha enweghị ike.
There is nowhere to go.	Enweghị ebe ọ ga-aga.
But there is more to it than that.	Ma e nwere ihe karịrị ya.
You and these are relatives.	Gị na ndị a bụ ndị ikwu.
He was a good boy.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwa nwoke.
That is now over.	Nke ahụ kwụsịrị ugbu a.
The company has its own office in this building.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ nwere ụlọ ọrụ ya n'ụlọ a.
There was no way around it.	O nweghị ụzọ gbara ya gburugburu.

He died just last year.	Ọ nwụrụ naanị afọ gara aga.
But it should.	Ma o kwesịrị.
It seems to come from more than one person.	O yiri ka o si n'aka ihe karịrị otu onye.
Get is instant.	Nweta bụ ozugbo.
He said nothing.	O nweghị ihe o kwuru.
He has a police station.	O nwere ọdụ ndị uwe ojii.
Each chapter.	Isi nke ọ bụla.
History books are not good.	Akwụkwọ akụkọ ihe mere eme adịghị mma.
He was in school at the time.	Ọ nọ n'ụlọ akwụkwọ n'oge ahụ.
And not only that.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị nke ahụ.

He refused to talk to me.	Ọ jụrụ ịgwa m okwu.
Only this time the two women left home.	Naanị oge a ka ụmụ nwanyị abụọ hapụrụ ụlọ.
What will happen to my little boy?	Kedu ihe ga-eme nwa m nwoke nke nta?

You can do that here.	Ị nwere ike ime nke ahụ ebe a.
You need something solid.	Ị chọrọ ihe siri ike.

You need more clothes.	Ị chọrọ akwa ọzọ.
Maybe no one can help you.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dịghị onye nwere ike inyere gị aka.
He had a family.	O nwere ezinụlọ.
No, go ahead if you want.	Mba, gaa n'ihu ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ.
As someone who can rejuvenate his body.	Dị ka ọ bụ onye nwere ike ime ka ahụ ya dị ọhụrụ.
It is different from the others.	Ọ dị iche na ndị ọzọ.
That was just many years ago.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ ọtụtụ afọ gara aga.
It was a big time in life.	Ọ bụ nnukwu oge ná ndụ.
I am not afraid of anything or anything.	Ụjọ anaghị adị m ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
You never know who people are.	Ị gaghị ama ndị mmadụ bụ.
That would not be for obvious reasons.	Nke ahụ agaghị abụ n'ihi ihe doro anya.
I do not want any.	Achọghị m nke ọ bụla.
We continued.	Anyị gara n'ihu.
A woman and two men.	Otu nwanyị na ụmụ nwoke abụọ.
Few have names.	Ole na ole nwere aha.
This should not happen.	Nke a ekwesịghị ime.
Before the event, she was very nervous.	Tupu ihe omume ahụ, ụjọ tụrụ ya nke ukwuu.
And it seemed as if they were going again.	O wee dị ka ha na-aga ọzọ.
He went to them.	Ọ gara n'isi ha.
This is a great city.	Nke a bụ nnukwu obodo.
No one knows what happened.	Ọ dịghị onye maara ihe merenụ.
That is the only way to do it.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị ụzọ ị ga-esi mee ya.
It's hard !.	O siri ike!.
There is no difference.	Enweghị ịdị adị iche.
But until we get there, let's have fun driving.	Mana ruo mgbe anyị rutere ebe ahụ, ka anyị nwee obi ụtọ ịnya ụgbọ ahụ.
The new car is smaller than the old car.	Ụgbọ ala ọhụrụ dị obere karịa ụgbọ ala ochie.
Such a situation is impossible.	Ọnọdụ dị otú ahụ enweghị ike ime.
Until they get a name.	Ruo mgbe ha nwetara aha.
But they did it well.	Mana ha mere ya nke ọma.
In some countries, it is legal.	Na mba ụfọdụ, ọ bụ iwu.
His father was frightened, but his mother became angry.	Nna ya tụrụ egwu, ma nne ya were iwe.
Behind them went weight again.	N'azụ ha gara ibu ọzọ.
Many people think that vegetarian food is good.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-eche na nri onye anaghị eri anụ dị mma.
They make perfect sense, of course.	Ha na-eme ka uche zuru oke, n'ezie.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.

For one thing, it matters how many people you have.	Otu ihe bụ na ọ dị mkpa mmadụ ole ị na-eme.
The city is famous for its movies.	Obodo a ma ama maka ihe nkiri ya.
That will not happen today, he told me.	Nke ahụ agaghị eme taa, ọ gwara m.
I never thought about these two together.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chere banyere abụọ ndị a ọnụ.
Each family has two cars.	Ezinụlọ ọ bụla nwere ụgbọ ala abụọ.
But if you know us, you know that.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ị maara anyị, ị maara nke ahụ.
It was probably the best time of my life.	Ma eleghị anya, oge ahụ bụ oge kacha mma ná ndụ m.
As long as you can run.	Ogologo oge ị nwere ike ịgba ọsọ.
If not for it, it will be yours.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị maka ya, ọ ga-abụ nke gị.

Thank you so much for the information.	Daalụ nke ukwuu maka ozi ahụ.

He ordered everyone to leave.	O nyere iwu ka onye ọ bụla pụọ.
Of course people need work and food.	N'ezie ndị mmadụ chọrọ ọrụ na nri.
It will be about two months.	Ọ ga-abụ ihe dị ka ọnwa abụọ.

Great work stopped.	Nnukwu ọrụ kwụsịrị.
But they should not know that.	Ma ha ekwesịghị ịma nke ahụ.
Maybe it was her husband.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ di ya.
I love this game so much, it has a great style.	Ahụrụ m egwuregwu a n'anya nke ukwuu, ọ nwere ụdị nke ukwuu.
Mice will survive.	Ụmụ oke ga-adị ndụ.

I think the past is very good.	Echere m na nke gara aga dị nnọọ mma.

He looked at his watch.	O lere elekere anya ya.
There are four women and two children.	Enwere ụmụ nwanyị anọ na ụmụaka abụọ.
These stories would not have been well known.	Akụkọ ndị a agaraghị ama nke ọma.
Now you are talking big money.	Ugbu a ị na-ekwu nnukwu ego.
It was the smile that made it, of course.	Ọ bụ ọnụ ọchị ahụ mere ya, n'ezie.
That is my job.	Ọ bụ ya bụ ọrụ m.

I think he was happy.	Echere m na obi dị ya ụtọ.
He told them that he did not know such things.	Ọ gwara ha na ya amaghị ihe ndị dị otú ahụ.
He doesn't like me.	O nweghị mmasị n'ebe m nọ.
He loves both of them.	Ọ hụrụ ha abụọ n'anya.
It will be near.	Ọ ga-adị nso.
Where it should be, for whatever reason.	Ebe ọ kwesịrị ịbụ, n'ihi ihe ọ bụla kpatara ya.
I will never do this to my son.	Agaghị m eme nwa m ihe a ma ọlị.

Of course, only what you think is important.	N'ezie, ọ bụ naanị ihe i chere ka ọ dị mkpa.

He knows the locals well.	Ọ maara ndị obodo nke ọma.
And it came to pass that he knew it.	O wee bụrụ na ọ ma ya.
From there, they do their job.	Site n'ebe ahụ, ha na-arụ ọrụ ha.

But not for me.	Ma ọ bụghị nye m.
You are the second person found dead.	Ị bụ onye nke abụọ hụrụ na ọ nwụrụ anwụ.
It is near a city.	Ọ dị nso n'otu obodo.
But we can't talk, we both know that very well.	Ma anyị enweghị ike ikwu okwu, anyị abụọ maara nke ahụ nke ọma.
He expected this.	Ọ tụrụ anya nke a.
This will prevent it from moving forward.	Nke a ga-eme ka ọ ghara ịga n'ihu.

He did not know.	Ọ maghị.

We will come from them stronger than ever.	Anyị ga-esi na ha bịa ike karịa ka ọ dị na mbụ.
We will not be sure until we do.	Anyị agaghị eji n'aka ruo mgbe anyị mere.
Most likely they should not be so bad.	O yikarịrị ka ha ekwesịghị ịdị njọ.
I was scared of you.	A tụrụ m gị ụjọ.
The head of state will do well with his promise to act.	Onye isi ala ga-eme nke ọma na nkwa ya ime ihe.
That is what he wants.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ chọrọ.

Sometimes, though, that is all there is to happiness.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ bụ naanị ihe na-eme ka mmadụ nwee obi ụtọ.
But being a good person can be a daunting task.	Ma ịbụ ezigbo mmadụ nwere ike ịbụ ọrụ siri ike.

Only then can the customer do the following.	Naanị mgbe ahụ onye ahịa nwere ike ime ihe ndị a.

These people have no legal right or practice to be here.	Ndị a enweghị ikike iwu ma ọ bụ omume ịnọ ebe a.

However, there are weaknesses.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere adịghị ike.

Wearing shoes is very important in travel.	Ịgba akpụkpọ ụkwụ dị ezigbo mkpa na njem.
That is what they do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ha na-eme.

You will be very happy together.	Unu ga-enwe nnọọ obi ụtọ ọnụ.

Although he says weight.	N'agbanyeghị na ọ na-ekwu na ibu ibu.
But it never really stopped.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe ọ kwụsịrị n'ezie.
There will be no hope for you today.	A gaghị enwe olileanya maka gị taa.
He just wanted to talk.	Ọ chọrọ naanị ikwu okwu.
I don't like simple windows stories over time.	Enweghị m mmasị na akụkọ ndị dị mfe windo n'ime oge.
He looked at her again.	O lere ya anya ọzọ.
Both eyes were considered.	E lere anya abụọ ahụ.
That person, whoever he is, can be a lot of people.	Onye ahụ, onye ọ bụla ọ bụ, nwere ike ịbụ ọtụtụ mmadụ.
But it came together.	Ma ọ bịara ọnụ.
There is no word on that.	Enweghị okwu ọ bụla na nke ahụ.
We looked at many names.	Anyị lere anya ọtụtụ aha.
Those jobs are mine.	Ọrụ ndị ahụ bụ nke m.
The possible reasons for this may be the following.	Ihe nwere ike ime nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ ihe ndị a.
It would have been better.	Ọ gaara adị mma karịa.
Not that one is better than the other.	Ọ bụghị na otu ahụ ka nke ọzọ mma.
It feels like my home.	Ọ dị m ka ọ̀ bụ ụlọ m.
It will be a long night.	Ọ ga-abụ ogologo abalị.
There are many trails here.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụzọ ụkwụ ebe a.
Only the first one happened.	Naanị nke mbụ mere.
Just go see what he wants.	Naanị gaa hụ ihe ọ chọrọ.
No two people can agree.	Ọ dịghị mmadụ abụọ nwere ike ikweta.

That morning then, and this morning now.	Ụtụtụ ahụ mgbe ahụ, na ụtụtụ a ugbu a.
We are from the same group.	Anyị si na otu.
It is my right.	Ọ bụ ikike m.

This makes it great.	Nke a na-eme ka ọ dị mma.
Not so well.	Ọ bụghị nke ọma.
But sometimes it is special.	Ma ọ dị mgbe ọ pụrụ iche.
In fact, they are just as bad.	N'ezie, ọ dị ha nnọọ ka ọ̀tụ̀tụ̀ ọjọọ.
But it would be nice if it was him.	Ma ọ ga-adị mma ma ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ ya.
My uncle bought a car last year.	Nwanne nna m zụtara ụgbọ ala n'afọ gara aga.
Or whatever it is.	Ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ.
Their children will do well.	Ụmụ ha ga-eme nke ọma.
Immediately the police questioned him.	Ozugbo ndị uwe ojii jụrụ ya ajụjụ.
No one knows what he is doing.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ihe ọ na-eme.
I am your teacher.	Abụ m onye nkuzi gị.
What we do not see, however, is his word.	Otú ọ dị, ihe anyị na-adịghị ahụ anya bụ okwu ya.
He has a gift for us.	O nwere onyinye maka anyị.
My opinion is that language is a problem here.	Echiche m bụ na asụsụ bụ nsogbu ebe a.
Tell them what you are doing.	Gwa ha ihe ị na-eme.
I could have done without that.	M gaara eme na-enweghị nke ahụ.
He told me something.	Ọ gwara m ihe.
Just one thought.	Naanị otu echiche.

Ten years probably.	Afọ iri eleghị anya.
We are running fast.	Anyị na-agba ọsọ ọsọ.
I was looking for something.	Anọ m na-achọ ihe.
We understand this better.	Anyị ghọtara ebe a karịa.
Not a lot of money, but at the time.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu ego, ma ọ bụ n'oge ahụ.
Everything is because you need them there.	Ihe ọ bụla bụ n'ihi na ị chọrọ ha ebe ahụ.
Until his death.	Ruo mgbe ọ nwụrụ.
Some may take this place or there.	Ụfọdụ pụrụ iche were ebe a ma ọ bụ ebe ahụ.
However, it is not good.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mma.
It may not be good.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị adị mma.
But he still had his place.	Ma ọ ka nwere ọnọdụ ya.
That did not happen and he could not.	Nke ahụ emeghị ma ọ nweghị ike.
Just a bad game.	Naanị egwuregwu ọjọọ.

Just like there is nothing funny about your shirt.	Dị nnọọ ka ọ dịghị ihe na-atọ ọchị banyere uwe elu gị.

But now we need a way forward.	Ma ugbu a, anyị chọrọ ụzọ aga n'ihu.
This is my story.	Nke a bụ akụkọ m.
That did not happen immediately.	Nke ahụ emeghị ozugbo.
We are not the law.	Anyị abụghị iwu.

Nothing will stop me here.	Ọ dịghị ihe ga-eme ka m kwụsị ebe a.
This type, of course, is one of them all.	Ụdị a, n'ezie, n'ime ha niile.
Then you try to do them over and over again.	Mgbe ahụ ị na-agbalị ime ha ugboro ugboro.
He was too drunk to talk.	Mmanya riri ya nke ukwuu ikwu okwu.
But only once.	Ma naanị otu oge.
It's big and cheap.	Ọ bụ nnukwu na ọnụ ala.
But we can't find one.	Ma anyị enweghị ike ịhụ otu.
One day he died.	Otu ụbọchị ọ nwụrụ.

I will never see him again.	Agaghị m ahụ ya ọzọ.
This place is awesome.	Ebe a dị egwu.
I want him to look at me.	Achọrọ m ka o lere m anya.
I didn't have a chance to comment until after the event.	Enweghị m ohere ikwu ruo mgbe ihe ahụ mechara.
It's useless.	O nweghị isi.

If so, we will be there for the day.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị, anyị ga-anọ ebe ahụ maka ụbọchị ahụ.
Now he knows.	Ugbu a, ọ maara.
This movie is in the countryside.	Ihe nkiri a dị n'ime ime obodo.
Bad idea.	Echiche dị njọ.

He was very busy in his own business.	O ji ọrụ n'aka nke ukwuu n'ọrụ nke ya.
We were told to leave immediately.	A gwara anyị ngwa ngwa ka anyị pụọ.

He invited her over for dinner.	Ọ kpọrọ ya ka ọ bịa nri abalị.
Then he saw it.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ hụrụ ya.
I will eat anything.	Aga m eri ihe ọ bụla.
He doesn’t care if they like it or not.	Ọ chọghị ịma ma ha nwere mmasị na ya ma ọ bụ na ha achọghị.
There is no suffering.	Ọ dịghị ahụhụ ọ bụla.
It looks like the country is going backwards.	Ọ dị ka mba ahụ na-aga azụ azụ.
Not a good thing.	Ọ bụghị ihe dị mma.
I'm glad you are fine.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ị dị mma.
He says there is a positive and a negative effect.	Ọ na-ekwu na enwere mmetụta dị mma na nke na-adịghị mma.

His name is unknown.	Amaghị aha ya.

There is no need for any active spirit.	Ọ dịghị mkpa mmụọ ọ bụla na-arụ ọrụ.
Second, it may be because of circumstances.	Nke abụọ, ọ nwere ike ịbụ n'ihi ihe ndị nwere ike ime.
He is well known for his eloquence.	Ọ bụ onye a ma ama maka ikwu okwu ọnụ ya.
I don't like talking to you, you know.	Ọ naghị amasị m ịgwa gị okwu, ị maara.

He is a doctor.	Ọ bụ dọkịta.

It sounds like everyone's singing.	Ọ dị ka ọ bụ abụ onye ọ bụla.

Of course it is us.	N'ezie ọ bụ anyị.

The store seems to be very busy.	Ụlọ ahịa ahụ yiri ezigbo ọrụ n'aka.

And such a beautiful dress and everything else.	Na uwe mara mma dị otú ahụ na ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.

Okay, wait.	Ọ dị mma, chere.
I'm impressed that her teachers loved my daughter so much.	Enwere m mmasị na ndị nkuzi ya hụrụ nwa m nwanyị n'anya nke ukwuu.
It's fun.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
No one has ever been here alone.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bụla onye ọ bụla nọrọ ebe a naanị ya.
How can that be?	Olee otú nke ahụ pụrụ isi mee?
But what a game it is.	Mana kedu egwuregwu ọ bụ.

There is only one way.	O nwere naanị otu ụzọ.
Everyone said they had no problem.	Onye ọ bụla kwuru na ha enweghị nsogbu.
Many patients died.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọrịa nwụrụ.
I just started my application when things started to get tough.	M ka malitere ngwa m mgbe ihe malitere isi ike.
But he still could not do it.	Ma ọ ka nweghị ike ime ya.
It was the coldest night in the winter.	Ọ bụ abalị kacha oyi n'oge oyi.
We never really thought about sports.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị chere ime egwuregwu n'ezie.
A little bit really.	Obere ntakịrị ihe n'ezie.
He likes to play sports.	Ọ na-enwe mmasị igwu egwuregwu.

It is not long.	Ọ dịghị anya.
I can't find anything in it.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla na ya.
For patients, this is good news.	Maka ndị ọrịa, nke a bụ ozi ọma.
But of course it did.	Ma n'ezie, o mere.
The only question is, how did this happen?	Naanị ajụjụ bụ, olee otú nke a si mee?
Many people criticized me.	Ọtụtụ mmadụ gbara m ụka.
Some thought it went too fast.	Ụfọdụ chere na ọ gara oke ngwa ngwa.
No one loves her.	O nweghị onye hụrụ ya n’anya.
I heard it myself last night.	M nụrụ ya onwe m n'abalị ụnyaahụ.
This should be our way.	Nke a kwesịrị ịbụ ụzọ anyị.
The building has a fantastic view.	Ụlọ ahụ nwere echiche dị egwu.
These people love each other, want each other.	Ndị a hụrụ ibe ha n'anya, chọrọ ibe ha.
And he went out.	O wee pụọ.
He is a good dog.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nkịta.
I will be perfect in my ability to do it.	M ga-abụ nke zuru oke na ikike m ime ya.
He was released.	A hapụrụ ya.
I never wanted it to happen.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chọrọ ka ọ mee.
This is an interested person.	Nke a bụ onye nwere mmasị.
Questions he liked more.	Ajụjụ na-amasị ya karịa.
What are you doing or planning to do?	Ihe ị na-eme ma ọ bụ na-eme atụmatụ ime bụ?
That's how they went, then.	Nke ahụ bụ ka ha gara, mgbe ahụ.
I feel like it is not.	Ọ dị m ka ọ bụghị.
We have absolutely no country.	Anyị enweghị nnọọ mba.
I know he will do great things.	Ama m na ọ ga-eme nnukwu ihe.
He wanted to talk.	Ọ chọrọ ikwu okwu.
It will happen on its own.	Ọ ga-eme n'onwe ya.
I have it.	Enwere m ya.
This does not make sense to me.	Nke a enweghị isi ọ bụla nye m.
These two things do not work.	Ihe abụọ a anaghị arụ ọrụ.
Worst of all, minutes.	Nke kacha njọ, nkeji.
This is the way of life.	Nke a bụ ụzọ ndụ.
He began to see the problem.	Ọ malitere ịhụ nsogbu ahụ.
But one day.	Ma ọ bụ otu ụbọchị.
It is the only thing that can be used.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe a ga-eji ya mee.
It’s what makes me different.	Ọ bụ ihe na-eme ka m dị iche.
Both would have been perfect.	Ha abụọ gaara abụ nke zuru oke.
They are doing their job.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ ha.
They work hard.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ siri ike.
Help them to use the machine!	Nyere ha aka iji igwe!
Those things started a little later.	Ihe ndị ahụ malitere ntakịrị ka oge na-aga.
It is a few months now.	Ọ dị ọnwa ole na ole ugbu a.
It looks like my house.	Ọ dị ka ụlọ m.

Needless to say, he left immediately.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ikwu, ọ hapụrụ ozugbo.
I looked behind the building.	M lere anya n'azụ ụlọ ahụ.
It made a difference.	O mere ka ọ dị iche.
Only the first two are small.	Naanị abụọ mbụ dị ntakịrị.
The food was hot and delicious.	Nri ahụ dị ọkụ ma na-atọ ụtọ.
This school is located in a rural area.	Ụlọ akwụkwọ a dị n'ime ime obodo.
There are no questions about that, of course.	Ọ nweghị ajụjụ ọ bụla gbasara nke ahụ, n'ezie.
Not her favorite room.	Ọ bụghị ọnụ ụlọ kacha amasị ya.
Just too.	Naanị kwa.
He made me smile.	O mere m ọnụ ọchị.
Just a bad day.	Naanị otu ụbọchị ọjọọ.
What the patriarch said is true.	Ihe nna ochie kwuru bụ eziokwu.
He is just a second son.	Ọ bụ naanị nwa nwoke nke abụọ.

Dress up and do something fun.	Yiri uwe ma mee ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
The other two are sitting.	Abụọ ndị nke ọzọ nọ ọdụ.
The girl liked the girl.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ masịrị nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
Everyone else is doing it.	Onye ọ bụla ọzọ na-eme ya.
It is still fresh.	Ọ ka dị ọhụrụ.
People know us.	Ndị mmadụ ma anyị.
Homework is not necessary.	Ọrụ ụlọ adịghị mkpa.
I have a feeling in my right hand.	Enwere m mmetụta n'aka nri m.
I don’t do that.	Anaghị m eme nke ahụ.
The car arrived today?	Ụgbọ ala bịara taa?
However, it is not good to be there actually.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mma ka ịnọ ebe ahụ n'ezie.
Go see them.	Gaa hụ ha.
My question is small.	Ajụjụ m dị obere.
This is their first year.	Nke a bụ afọ mbụ ha.
He was told it was one of them.	A gwara ya na ọ bụ otu n'ime ya.
But, that is what the police are doing.	Mana, nke ahụ bụ ihe ndị uwe ojii na-eme.
You never understood.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ị ghọtara.
That is if he needs help.	Nke ahụ bụ ma ọ bụrụ na ọ chọrọ enyemaka.
Only have it one month.	Naanị nwere ya otu ọnwa.
You know, you know that.	Ị mara, mara nke ahụ.
I don't know what else to do here.	Amaghị ihe ọzọ ị ga-eme ebe a.
But they, and we, look forward to continuing in school.	Mana ha, na anyị, na-atụ anya ịga n'ihu n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
Apparently another girl's strength.	O doro anya na ike nwa agbọghọ ọzọ.
You are all fools.	Unu niile bụ ndị nzuzu.
You are not like others.	Ị dịghị ka ndị ọzọ.
Could this be ?.	Ọ nwere ike ịbụ nke a?.
Go ahead.	Gaa n'ihu.
He said that this would not be true.	O kwuru na nke a agaghị abụ eziokwu.
I do not want to go to this game.	Achọghị m ịga egwuregwu a.
It is a house.	Ọ bụ ụlọ.
There are a few plans to be had here.	Enwere ntakịrị atụmatụ a ga-enwe ebe a.
Old, but solid.	Ochie, ma siri ike.
We want them to stop being dogs.	Anyị chọrọ ka ha kwụsị ịbụ nkịta.
It should not be.	O kwesịghị ịbụ.
The benefits are obvious.	Uru doro anya.
I love the way they do.	M hụrụ n'anya otú ha si eme.
Thanks for your help.	Daalụ maka enyemaka gị.
Make it a family affair.	Mee ya ka ọ bụrụ ihe gbasara ezinụlọ.
But nowadays, there is little chance of doing anything.	Ma n'oge a, ọ dị obere ohere ime ihe ọ bụla.
They left suddenly.	Ha hapụrụ na mberede.
Inside their skin.	N'ime akpụkpọ ahụ ha.

I'll talk to you right away.	Aga m agwa gị okwu ozugbo.
Sleep is important.	Ụra dị mkpa.
Not just one other person, either.	Ọ bụghị naanị otu onye ọzọ, ma.
Of course, everyone's own.	N'ezie, onye ọ bụla nke ya.
These countries have extreme limits.	Mba ndị a nwere oke oke oke.
It’s not just about traveling.	Ọ bụghị naanị ịga njem.
It is summer!	Ọ bụ oge okpomọkụ!
With my two sisters.	Mụ na nwanne m nwanyị abụọ.
This is not difficult.	Nke a adịghị esi ike.
Things do not look right.	Ihe adịghị ka o yiri.
Get it here now, as they say.	Nweta ya ebe a ugbu a, dị ka ha na-ekwu.
It should not be done this way.	E kwesịghị ime ya otú a.
I really know the family.	Amaara m ezinụlọ n'ezie.
But that is another story.	Ma nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ọzọ.
However, many of these are going backwards.	Otú ọ dị, ọtụtụ n'ime ndị a na-aga n'ihu azụ azụ.
Nothing happened, because things seemed like a long time.	Ọ dịghị ihe mere, n'ihi na ihe yiri ogologo oge.
Of course that is its beauty.	N'ezie nke ahụ bụ ịma mma ya.
Why not.	Gịnị mere na ị gaghị.
They are useful for anglers.	Ha bụ ihe bara uru maka ndị ọkụ azụ.
You do every day, and everything, better.	Ị na-eme ụbọchị ọ bụla, na ihe niile, ka mma.
Still, the long road may be just what we need.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ụzọ ahụ dị ogologo pụrụ ịbụ nnọọ ihe dị anyị mkpa.
This is my priority.	Nke a bụ ihe kacha m mkpa.
They both work as one.	Ha abụọ na-arụ ọrụ dị ka otu.
The floor of the big house is beautiful.	Ala nke nnukwu ụlọ ahụ mara mma.
So here, nothing special happens.	Ya mere, ebe a, ọ dịghị ihe pụrụ iche na-eme.
I really tried to think about it.	M gbalịrị n'ezie iche echiche banyere ya.
Not at eleven.	Ọ bụghị na iri na otu.

Everyone here knows her.	Onye ọ bụla nọ ebe a maara ya.

He made these statements.	O kwuru okwu ndị a.
You have time.	Ị nwere oge.
We are well aware of this situation.	Anyị maara ọnọdụ a nke ọma.
You will need help.	Ị ga-achọ enyemaka.
This is for planning.	Nke a bụ maka ime atụmatụ.
You know, it’s pretty much like that.	Ị mara, ọ mara mma nke ukwuu dị ka nke ahụ.
I think so much.	Echere m nke ukwuu.
The moral path is small.	Ụzọ omume dị obere dị ntakịrị.
They are not a problem.	Ha abụghị nsogbu.
There is no reason for it.	O nweghị ihe kpatara ya.
For some more than others.	Maka ụfọdụ karịa ndị ọzọ.
He needs a special car or whatever.	Ọ chọrọ ụgbọ ala pụrụ iche ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
If not, you do not.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị, ị gaghị eme ya.
Everything is human and personal.	Ihe niile bụ mmadụ na onye.
The people he will help, because that is his job.	Ndị ọ ga-enyere aka, n'ihi na nke ahụ bụ ọrụ ya.
It seems like a long way off.	Ọ dị ka ebe dị anya.
That is just the story.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ akụkọ.
You need nothing more.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ị chọrọ.
Please let me know if you have any further questions.	Biko mee ka m mara ma ị nwere ajụjụ ọ bụla ọzọ.
I can't do it at this time.	Enweghị m ike ime ya n'oge a.
He left his home.	Ọ hapụrụ ụlọ ya.
But it is so.	Ma ọ dị otú ahụ.
The difference is that he did it twice.	Ihe dị iche bụ na o mere ya ugboro abụọ.
It was left unsafe.	A hapụrụ ya n'ụzọ na-adịghị mma.
By the way.	N'ụzọ ọ dị mma.
He spoke well.	O kwuru nke ọma.
I have no money.	Enweghị m ego.
However, they cost more.	Otú ọ dị, ha na-eri karịa.
He was a strong judge.	Ọ bụ onye ikpe siri ike.
I need to call.	Ekwesịrị m ịkpọ.
It looks like this.	Ọ dị ka nke a.
None of these things are here.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a dị ebe a.
Of course, it is a big problem.	N'ezie, ọ bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
We need you here.	Anyị chọrọ gị ebe a.
It can be good.	Ọ nwere ike ịdị mma.
The rules of the game are very simple.	Iwu egwuregwu dị nnọọ mfe.
Provide children with books and toys.	Nye ụmụaka akwụkwọ na ihe egwuregwu ụmụaka.
There is no strength in doing his job.	Ọ dịghị ike ọ na-arụ ọrụ ya.
This is not true.	Nke a abụghị eziokwu.
But somehow you are farther away from me.	Ma n'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ị nọ n'ebe dị anya karịa m.
I can't tell you anything else.	Enweghị m ike ịgwa gị ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
The athlete earned a lot of money.	Onye na-eme egwuregwu nwetara nnukwu ego.
He was a great man.	Ọ bụ nnukwu nwoke.
But no, it doesn’t work the other way around.	Ma mba, ọ naghị arụ ọrụ n'ụzọ ọzọ.
I feel like I am.	Ọ dị m ka ọ dị m.
Like this special day.	Dị ka ụbọchị a pụrụ iche.
Fast food is easy to find.	Nri ngwa ngwa dị mfe ịchọta.
The problem is that no one really knows what he wants.	Nsogbu bụ na ọ dịghị onye maara n'ezie ihe ọ chọrọ.
Long time for common sense.	Ogologo oge maka ezi uche.
All the way down.	N'ụzọ niile ala.
Just think of doing the same.	Na-eche naanị ime otu ihe ahụ.
It was an hour of fear.	Ọ bụ awa ụjọ.
Two people, two ideas are different.	Mmadụ abụọ, echiche abụọ dị iche.
Second, no such test was ever performed.	Nke abụọ, ọ dịghị ule dị otú ahụ n'oge a.
This is very important to me.	Nke a dị m ezigbo mkpa.
The girl was left alone on the beach.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ hapụrụ naanị ya n'akụkụ osimiri.
I look forward to that day.	Ana m atụ anya ụbọchị ahụ.
It makes sense.	Ọ bụ ezi uche.
I think more information will continue to come.	Echere m na ozi ndị ọzọ ga-aga n'ihu na-abịa.
He went to a restaurant.	Ọ gara ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
Others did much of it.	Ndị ọzọ mere ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
Or at least that should be the case.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, otú ahụ ka o kwesịrị ịdị.
They gave me drugs and told me that I was fine.	Ha nyere m ọgwụ ọjọọ, gwa m na ọ dịghị ihe na-eme m.
It started well.	Ọ malitere nke ọma.
The weather is very different.	Ihu igwe dị iche iche nke ukwuu.
One does not really want that.	Otu anaghị achọ nke ahụ n'ezie.
It’s like our situation.	Ọ dị ka ọnọdụ anyị.
Stories have action.	Akụkọ nwere omume.
News and information go faster.	Akụkọ na ozi na-aga ngwa ngwa karịa.
He has his boat in front of his house.	O nwere ụgbọ mmiri ya n’ihu ụlọ ya.
Not good players.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo ndị egwuregwu.
Everything else can be the same.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ nwere ike ịdị otu.

You are very strong.	Ị siri ike nke ukwuu.
He had no children and no small families.	O nweghị ụmụ na obere ezinụlọ ndị ọzọ.
The tallest building in the country is being built here.	A na-arụ ụlọ kacha ogologo na mba ahụ ebe a.
I could play the game for hours at a time.	Enwere m ike na-eche egwuregwu ruo ọtụtụ awa n'otu oge.
So I did it.	M wee mee ya.
There is still much to be done.	A ka nwere ọtụtụ ihe ime.

If they are, real.	Ọ bụrụ na ha dị, ezigbo.

But you will be fine.	Mana ị ga-adị mma.
However, they were still indoors.	Otú ọ dị, ha ka nọ n'ime ụlọ.
But so it goes.	Ma otú ahụ ka ọ na-aga.
But it did.	Ma o mere.
The application works.	Ngwa ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ.
The staff was very happy.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ nwere ezigbo obi ụtọ.
Someone knows why, of course.	Otu onye maara ihe kpatara ya, n'ezie.
What can one say about that.	Kedu ihe mmadụ nwere ike ikwu nke ahụ.
That's it.	Ọ bụ ya.
It is so.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
He has no fears or doubts in his heart.	O nweghị egwu ma ọ bụ obi abụọ n'obi ya.
They liked it.	Ha masịrị ya.
The girl is playing.	Nwata nwanyị ahụ na-egwu egwu.
This is another test in law school.	Nke a bụ ule ọzọ n'ụlọ akwụkwọ iwu.
Of course, it was the perfect moment.	N'ezie, ọ bụ oge zuru oke.
Three other companies collapsed this week.	Ụlọ ọrụ atọ ọzọ dara n'izu a.
I think my name will do well.	Echere m na aha m ga-eme nke ọma.
They are really fun.	N'ezie, ha na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
The need is real.	Mkpa dị adị.
The examples follow.	Ihe atụ ndị ahụ mechara.
The woman was just as sure.	Nwanyị nwanyị ahụ dị nnọọ ka nwanyị ji n'aka.
You can use it for your ideas.	Ị nwere ike iji ya maka echiche gị.
He looked forward.	O lere anya n'ihu.
It is very real.	Ọ dị nnọọ adị.
So he is the most active.	Ya mere ọ bụ ya kacha eme ihe.
He is a much prettier man.	Ọ bụ nwoke mara mma karịa.
I can do it.	Enwere m ike ime ya.
We do not know what it will be like, either.	Anyị amaghị otú ọ ga-adị, ma.
No one loves her.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya n'anya.
I do not like.	Ọ naghị amasị m.
But that is impossible.	Ma nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume.
People are happy, happy.	Ndị mmadụ nwere obi ụtọ, nwee obi ụtọ.
At first she spoke to him immediately.	Na nke mbụ ọ gwara ya okwu ozugbo.
That it is not as bad as it really is.	Na ọ dịghị njọ dị ka ọ dị n'ezie.
This alone is different.	Naanị nke a dị iche.
He is a fool.	Ọ bụ nwoke nzuzu.
They understood their role.	Ha ghọtara ọrụ ha.
You may be wondering what took longer.	Ị nwere ike na-eche ihe were ogologo oge.
We need it so much.	Anyị chọrọ ya nke ukwuu.
Not real.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo.
I know they will not do it.	Ama m na ha agaghị eme ya.
That would be worth a fool.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ọnụ ahịa onye nzuzu.
His father was unemployed for three months.	Nna ya enweghị ọrụ ọnwa atọ.
I will do it again.	Aga m eme ya ọzọ.
Can we take a bus?	Anyị nwere ike ịga ụgbọ ala?
I do not know how fast this car will go.	Amaghị m otú ụgbọ ala a ga-esi aga ngwa ngwa.
This seems something new.	Nke a dị ka ihe ọhụrụ.
Stupid thoughts.	Echiche nzuzu.

There are other ways to get it, long before this.	Enwere ụzọ ndị ọzọ isi nweta ya, ogologo oge tupu nke a.
Family life is not easy now.	Ndụ ezinụlọ adịghị mfe ugbu a.
You need ideas.	Ị chọrọ echiche.

Nothing was heard of them again.	Ọ dịghị ihe a nụrụ banyere ha ọzọ.
We are swimmers like them.	Anyị bụ ndị na-egwu mmiri ka ha.
A lot of anything, you could say.	Ọtụtụ ihe ọ bụla, ị nwere ike ikwu.
No manual labor problems.	Enweghị nsogbu ọrụ aka.
They have three speeds to go.	Ha nwere ọsọ atọ ime.
He speaks only power.	Ọ na-ekwu naanị ike.
This is how it should be done.	Otú a ka e kwesịrị isi mee ya.
You do not know what they are.	Ị maghị ihe ha .
Just to find it.	Ọ bụ naanị ịchọta ya.

It should be.	O kwesịrị ịbụ.
Sometimes they want someone who is wise.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha chọrọ onye maara ihe.
The second sensor measures the temperature.	Ihe mmetụta nke abụọ na-atụ oke okpomọkụ.
You are a real mother.	Ị bụ ezigbo nne.
No one is worried about what happened.	Obi adịghị onye nwere ihe merenụ.
There is no way.	O nweghị ụzọ.
This city has a school.	Obodo a nwere otu ụlọ akwụkwọ.
What he did was foolish and frightening.	Ihe o mere bụ ma nzuzu ma ụjọ.
The question is, why, and why now ?.	Ajụjụ bụ, gịnị kpatara, na gịnị kpatara ugbu a?.
But if you do not know that you are doing well.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ị maghị na ị na-eme nke ọma.
One has nothing to do with the other.	Otu enweghị ihe ọ ga-eme karịa nke ọzọ.
We have known each other for over ten years.	Anyị maara ibe anyị ihe karịrị afọ iri.
Because they know.	N'ihi na ha maara.
I can't see very well.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ya nke ọma.

That is not the case.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka o si eme.
The police do not know what they are doing.	Ndị uwe ojii achọghị ịma ihe ha na-eme.
He runs for a long time.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ ogologo oge.
I think that is important.	Echere m na nke ahụ dị mkpa.
We thought.	Anyị chere.
What are these in their minds.	Gịnị bụ ndị a na uche ha.
He is very worried.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya nke ukwuu.
We had a great time.	Anyị nwere ezigbo oge.
It seems more difficult than that.	Ọ dị ka ihe siri ike karịa nke ahụ.
I was just always there.	Enwere m naanị mgbe niile.
There is little they can do to make them think.	Ọ dị obere ihe ha ga-eme ka ha chere.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.	Daalụ daalụ daalụ.
I am of little use here.	Adịghị m obere uru ebe a.
He couldn’t feel much while running.	Ọ nweghị ike inwe mmetụta nke ukwuu mgbe ọ na-agba ọsọ.
I have no money.	Enweghị m ego ọ bụla.
I suddenly saw why you are so great.	Ahụrụ m na mberede ihe mere i ji bụrụ nnukwu ihe.
From then on, his work began.	Site na mgbe ahụ, a malitere ọrụ ya.
It was the last city to have a solid currency, of course.	Ọ bụ obodo ikpeazụ nwere ego siri ike, n'ezie.
It's the most delicious.	Ọ bụ ihe kacha atọ ụtọ.
He has his hand in everything.	O nwere aka ya n'ihe niile.
You can do this yourself if you know how.	Ị nwere ike ime nke a n'onwe gị ma ọ bụrụ na ị maara otú.
Still, it doesn't seem to matter.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ihe ọ bụla.

Most of it.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
I would like to think about it.	Ọ ga-amasị m iche echiche banyere ya.
That moment is mine.	Oge ahụ bụ nke m.
That was clear in time.	Nke ahụ doro anya n'oge.
We try something else.	Anyị na-agbalị ihe ọzọ.
That was another exciting time.	Nke ahụ bụ oge ọzọ na-atọ ụtọ.
They have little love.	Ha nwere obere oge ịhụ n'anya.
It is our city.	Ọ bụ obodo anyị.
I am alone here.	Anọ m naanị m ebe a.
That is very clear.	Nke ahụ doro anya nke ọma.
It only eats green.	Ọ na-eri naanị akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ.
But this time, this is not a bad thing.	Ma n'oge a, nke a adịghị njọ.
Doing a good job.	Ime ezigbo ọrụ.
I'm still waiting to see it.	M ka na-eche ịhụ ya.
Upon his arrival, he saw many headlines.	Ozugbo o rutere, ọ hụrụ ọtụtụ isi okwu.
Interest is not a problem.	Mmasị abụghị nsogbu.
From his friends.	Site na ndị enyi ya.
It was just the baby.	Ọ bụ naanị nwa ahụ.
That is my point.	Nke ahụ bụ isi okwu m.

I think it helped a lot.	Echere m na o nyere aka nke ukwuu.
He wants a vacation.	Ọ chọrọ ezumike.
We quickly learned from there.	Anyị si ebe ahụ mara ngwa ngwa.
One afternoon, he stopped.	Otu ehihie, ọ kwụsịrị.
Why he did it, no one now knows.	Ihe mere o ji mee otú ahụ, ọ dịghị onye maara ugbu a.
There is a lot to be done.	Enwere nnukwu ihe a ga-eme.
They are both female.	Ha abụọ bụ nwanyị.
That does not work.	Nke ahụ anaghị arụ ọrụ.
But here, there is something.	Mana ebe a, enwere ihe.
You definitely go.	Ị doro anya ịga.
I really can.	Enwere m ike n'ezie.
Or whatever it is.	Ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ.
It sounds like a joke.	Ọ dị ka ihe ọchị.
But it is easier said than done.	Ma ọ dị mfe ikwu karịa ime.
We got time.	Anyị nwetara oge.
Wine was very bad last night.	Mmanya na-adịghị mma nke ukwuu n'abalị ụnyaahụ.
I have no idea how to do this.	Enweghị m echiche otu esi eme nke a.
And the boy did it wrong.	Na nwa nwoke mere na ọ dị njọ.

But one day, he does it.	Ma otu ụbọchị, ọ na-eme ya.
Thank him for the valuable tutorial.	Gwa ya daalụ maka nkuzi bara uru.

It is your fault.	Ọ bụ gị kpatara ya.
Do everything right.	Mee ihe niile nke ọma.

We ate lunch, which we had prepared for ourselves.	Anyị riri nri ehihie, bụ́ nke anyị nyere onwe anyị.
He thought there would be less people.	O chere na a ga-enwe obere mmadụ.
He did his best to make me happy.	O mere ike ya niile ime ka m nwee obi ụtọ.
Because the face will be awesome.	N'ihi na ihu ga-adị egwu.

You always thought that simple things could be used.	Ị na-eche mgbe niile ka enwere ike iji ihe dị mfe mee ihe.
And the old idea does not work.	Na echiche ochie anaghị arụ ọrụ.
Sometimes the customers work.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ndị ahịa ọrụ.
More things will come in time.	Ihe ndị ọzọ ga-abịa n'ime oge.
The plans worked.	Atụmatụ ndị ahụ gara nke ọma.
I do not want this life anymore.	Achọghị m ndụ a ọzọ.
But you may face this challenge.	Ma ị nwere ike iche ihe isi ike a ihu.
For you, this book is important.	Maka gị, akwụkwọ a dị mkpa.

The team leader addressed the crowd.	Onye isi otu ahụ gwara igwe mmadụ okwu.
But you have reason to be more numerous.	Ma i nwere ihe mere ị ga-eji bụrụ karịa ọtụtụ.
But that is not all.	Ma, ọ bụghị naanị otú ahụ ka ọkụ si agba anyị.
For now, this is obvious.	Maka ugbu a, nke a bụ ihe doro anya.
Gain life.	Nweta ndụ.
This does not do anything.	Nke a anaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.
They make you feel good about the kids.	Ha na-enwe ihu ọma na ị dị mma na ụmụaka.
They may be able to get some help.	Ha nwere ike nweta enyemaka ụfọdụ.
Life is hard.	Ndụ siri ike.

It makes them feel strong.	Ọ na-eme ka ha nwee mmetụta dị ike.
We met last night here in this room.	Anyị zutere n'abalị ụnyaahụ ebe a n'ime ụlọ a.
There is no doubt about it.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na nke ahụ.
No one was waiting for us there.	Ọ dịghị onye nọ na-eche anyị ebe ahụ.
Please, no.	Biko, mba.
There is no such thing.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ.
Her car is on fire!	Ụgbọ ala ya na-agba ọkụ!
Types of accidents.	Ụdị ihe mberede.
You do not have the right to be here.	Ị nweghị ikike ịnọ ebe a.
The house is beautiful with a lot of space.	Ụlọ ahụ mara mma nke nwere nnukwu ohere.
What does he want, he thinks.	Gịnị ka ọ chọrọ, ọ na-eche.
But there is more to that than that.	Ma e nwere ihe ọzọ ebe nke ahụ si.
He likes to play football.	Ọ na-amasị ya ịgba bọọlụ.
I told you that before.	Agwara m gị nke ahụ n'ihu.
He would go to his room.	Ọ ga-aga n'ọnụ ụlọ ya.
He is a weakling.	Ọ bụ onye na-adịghị ike.
The boy's face lit up.	Nwa nwoke ahụ chere ihu n'ihu.
I was a child at the time.	Abụ m nwata n'oge ahụ.
We thought it was good.	Anyị chere na ọ dị mma.
When things work out, well, that’s it.	Mgbe ihe na-arụ ọrụ, nke ọma, nke ahụ bụ ya.
The group went swimming.	Ndị otu ahụ gara igwu mmiri.
Then suddenly he heard you.	Mgbe ahụ na mberede ọ nụrụ gị.
That's it.	Ọ bụ ya.
Then we fell in love that summer night.	Mgbe ahụ, anyị hụrụ n'anya n'abalị okpomọkụ ahụ.
Here, we can imagine.	N'ebe a, anyị nwere ike iche.
If the weather is really bad, stay indoors.	Ọ bụrụ na ihu igwe dị egwu n'ezie, nọrọ n'ime ụlọ.
Here and there.	N'ebe a ma.
Like a letter, but not.	Dị ka akwụkwọ ozi, ma ọ bụghị.
Everyone wants something different.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ ihe dị iche.
One message is as beautiful as the other.	Otu ozi mara mma dị ka nke ọzọ.
Want to see it.	Achọrọ ịhụ ya.
Power in one place is not unique from any other.	Ike n'otu ebe abụghị ihe pụrụ iche site na ebe ọ bụla ọzọ.
He says something.	Ọ na-ekwu ihe.
But that will not happen.	Mana nke ahụ agaghị eme.
But sometimes it makes no sense.	Ma mgbe ụfọdụ ọ na-eme ka enweghị uche.
Maybe it's a bug.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ahụhụ.
At one time they had three schools.	N'otu oge ha nwere ụlọ akwụkwọ atọ.
Are these there ?.	Ndị a ọ dị?.
You can go then.	Ị nwere ike ịga mgbe ahụ.
Best football player.	Onye egwuregwu bọọlụ kacha mma.
I waited for a while.	Echere m nwa oge.
His second study.	Ọmụmụ ihe nke abụọ ya.
I loved every minute of it.	Ahụrụ m nkeji ọ bụla n'anya.
Not so in our community.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ na obodo anyị.
The evil of my childhood.	Ihe ọjọọ nke nwata m.
He loves things.	O nwere mmasị n'ihe.
Not by chance.	Ọ bụghị na mberede ka nke ya.
No one seems to care.	Ọ dịghị onye ọ dị ka ọ na-eche.
Fire is one example.	Ọkụ bụ otu ihe atụ.
There are people at home.	E nwere ndị mmadụ n'ụlọ.

He never told me about it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ gwara m banyere ya.
Come again so that nothing happens.	Bịa ọzọ ka ọ nweghị ihe merenụ.

In one case, however, he was certain.	Otú ọ dị, n'ime otu ihe, o ji n'aka.
Human behavior is about what we do in real life.	Omume mmadụ bụ maka ihe anyị na-eme na ndụ n'ezie.
Very well.	Ọ dị mma nke ukwuu.

We run and try to find it everywhere.	Anyị na-agba ọsọ na-agbalị ịchọta ya n'ebe ọ bụla.
Probably so.	O nwere ike ịbụ na o mere otú ahụ.
This problem is due to back pain.	Nsogbu a bụ n'ihi azụ azụ.
That is the point.	Nke ahụ bụ isi okwu a.
The baby is OK.	Nwa ahụ dị mma.
I am very happy to say that now we are.	Obi dị m ụtọ nke ukwuu ikwu na ugbu a, anyị nọ.

Of course, that was the first step.	N'ezie, nke ahụ bụ ụzọ mbụ.
My friend.	Enyi m.
It was cold all around.	Oyi oyi gbara ya gburugburu.
No group required.	Enweghị otu chọrọ.
One of the main reasons they are successful is to make things easier.	Otu nnukwu ihe mere ha ji nwee ihe ịga nke ọma bụ ime ka ihe dị mfe.
The man knew he knew.	Nwoke maara na ọ maara.
The city does not have access to safe water.	Obodo enweghị mmiri mmiri na-adịghị mma.
Nice to be there.	Ọ dị mma ịnọ ebe ahụ.
Your father and I did the same thing.	Mụ na nna gị mere otu ihe ahụ.
His parents were very angry with him.	Nne na nna ya were ya iwe nke ukwuu.

You can do only what you can.	Ị nwere ike ime naanị ihe dị gị n'aka.

He does not seem to know very well.	O yighị ka ọ maara nke ọma.
That is the only truth of its own.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị eziokwu nke ya.
He certainly liked it.	O doro anya na ọ masịrị ya.

They invited classmates to come.	Ha kpọrọ ụmụ akwụkwọ ibe ha ka ha bịa hụ.

The room was right in front of me.	Ọnụ ụlọ ahụ dị n'ihu m ozugbo.
All these things I need.	Ihe ndị a niile dị m mkpa.
The news of the accident terrified the villagers.	Akụkọ mberede ahụ tụrụ ndị obodo ahụ ụjọ.
She looked like a beautiful little girl.	O yiri obere uwe mara mma.
He thought his heart was beating fast.	O chere na obi ya na-agba ọsọ ọsọ.
There is no doubt about it.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya.
I am looking for other ways.	M na-achọ ụzọ ndị ọzọ.
He never told us about this!	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ gwara anyị banyere nke a!
I enjoy the city every day.	Obodo na-atọ m ụtọ kwa ụbọchị.
It is impossible.	Ọ naghị ekwe omume.
He came to see me.	Ọ bịara ịhụ m.
You know, these are good women.	Ị mara, ndị a bụ ezigbo ụmụ nwanyị.
I can not know what he is talking about.	Apụghị m ịma ihe ọ na-ekwu.

No sorry, nothing.	Ọ dịghị nwute, ọ dịghị ihe.
We have problems on all sides.	Anyị na-enwe nsogbu n'akụkụ niile.
Liked the idea for a few moments.	Masịrị echiche ahụ maka oge ole na ole.
This surprises me.	Nke a na-atụ m n'anya.
I don't like the music, it's hot.	Egwu ahụ anaghị amasị m, ọkụ dị ọkụ.
I don't have time for it.	Enweghị m oge maka ya.
I do not have a point.	Enweghị m otu isi ihe.
We have no idea.	Anyị enweghị echiche.
I love the man.	Ahụrụ m nwoke ahụ n'anya.
He was just a man.	Ọ bụ naanị nwoke.
I tried to comment.	M gbalịrị ikwu uche.
It is my age.	Ọ bụ afọ m.
Amazing things are happening here.	Ihe dị egwu na-eme ebe a.
Things started to go wrong for me.	Ihe malitere ịpụ m.
No is a country.	Mba bụ mba.
I feel so much better.	Enwere m mmetụta nke ukwuu.
Maybe 30 minutes.	Ma eleghị anya, nkeji iri atọ.
He looked at his watch.	O lere anya na elekere ya.
His wives are still alive.	Ndị nwunye ya ka dị ndụ.
Her son was angry.	Nwa ya nwoke were iwe.
I'm too bad.	Adị m njọ nke ukwuu.
The smallest is true.	Nke obere bụ eziokwu.
This is our plan of action.	Atụmatụ ọrụ anyị bụ nke a.
There are two main reasons for this.	E nwere isi ihe abụọ kpatara nke a.
It cannot always be done.	Enweghị ike ime ya mgbe niile.
That is a big deal.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ihe.
Runners in their bags.	Ndị na-agba agba na akpa ha.
Man is what makes us human.	Mmadụ bụ ihe na-eme anyị mmadụ.
That or anything in the water.	Nke ahụ ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla dị n'ime mmiri.
It was a spring break.	Ọ bụ ezumike mmiri.
Their value to us is negative and the best.	Uru ha n'ebe anyị nọ dị njọ na kacha mma.
It just did.	O mere nnọọ.
It is true.	Ọ bụ ezi.
They try to do that for two or three years.	Ha na-agbalị ime otú ahụ afọ abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ.
Is this a grammar?	Nke a ọ̀ bụ ụtọ ụtọ asụsụ?
It is the male body, which is almost identical.	Ọ bụ ahụ́ nwoke, nke fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ụzọ abụọ.
Any idea how to get that.	Echiche ọ bụla ka m ga-esi nweta nke ahụ.
It is not new.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọhụrụ.
I am still friends with her.	Mụ na ya ka bụ enyi.
But it's something new.	Ma ọ bụ ihe ọhụrụ.
Give it three more.	Nye ya atọ ọzọ.
The man suggested that he have lunch with her the next day.	Nwoke ahụ tụrụ aro ka ya na ya rie nri ehihie echi.
I think he is very good at his job.	Echere m na ọ mara ezigbo mma n'ọrụ ya.
This is a very different matter.	Nke a bụ ihe dị nnọọ iche.

And the bigger the lie, the better.	Na nnukwu ụgha, ka mma.
The mind can never imagine this.	Uche enweghị ike iche nke a ma ọlị.
He behaved well over the years.	O mere omume nke ọma kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
Believe it or not.	Kwere ya gbasara anyị.
They will do that, he knows.	Ha ga-eme nke ahụ, ọ maara.
He danced there.	Ọ gbara egwu ebe ahụ.
At first you did not know what had happened.	Na mbụ ị maghị ihe merenụ.
This is going to be a big meat.	Nke a ga-abụ nnukwu anụ ahụ.
That is good.	Ihe ahụ dị mma.
The messenger delivered four letters.	Onye ozi ahụ nyere akwụkwọ ozi anọ.
I told him my opinion.	Agwara m ya echiche m.
Maybe he hates me now.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ kpọrọ m asị ugbu a.
I know these cars.	Amaara m ụgbọ ala ndị a.
Not the same as others.	Ọ bụghị otu ihe ahụ dị ka ndị ọzọ.
I know it is not.	Ama m na ọ bụghị ya.
Most of them work two or three jobs.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha na-arụ ọrụ abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ.
Now, suddenly, a man came along.	Ugbu a, na mberede, otu nwoke bịara.
In this work, three different approaches are suggested.	N'ime ọrụ a, a na-atụ aro ụzọ atọ dị iche iche.
But it scared me.	Ma ọ tụrụ m ụjọ.
I think a lot of people do that kind of thing.	Echere m na ọtụtụ ndị na-eme ụdị ihe ahụ.
This is her new face she is making.	Nke a bụ ihu ọhụrụ ya ọ na-eme.
He put it in his hand.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'aka.
It is not just the door that goes through itself.	Ọ bụghị naanị n'ọnụ ụzọ ahụ ka ọ na-aga n'onwe ya.
Our girls are so cute here.	Ụmụ agbọghọ anyị nwere ezigbo mma ebe a.
At the time he was successful.	N'oge ọ gara nke ọma.
He has no dogs.	O nweghị nkịta.
That is the way it can be.	Otú ahụ ka o nwere ike isi mee.
Without it nothing would have happened.	Na-enweghị ya ọ dịghị ihe ga-eme.
I do not know that you can do this.	Amaghị m na ị nwere ike ime nke a.
I hope driving is not too long.	Enwere m olileanya na ịnya ụgbọ ala adịghị ogologo.
Which is true.	Nke bụ eziokwu.
There are no houses like this anywhere else.	Enweghị ụlọ dị ka nke a n'ebe ọ bụla ọzọ.
I want to see that with you.	Achọrọ m ịhụ nke ahụ na gị.
He is the man who makes everyone happy.	Ọ bụ nwoke ahụ na-eme mmadụ niile obi ụtọ.
Only children are violent.	Naanị ụmụaka na-eme ihe ike.
Winter is very cold.	Oge oyi dị oke oyi.

The weather is very hot.	Ihu igwe dị oke ọkụ.
There are more of them than ever before.	E nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha karịa mgbe ọ bụla.
Once the city is the same.	Ozugbo obodo ahụ bụ otu ihe.
I was really left out.	A hapụrụ m ndụ n'ezie.
They knew what to do.	Ha ma ihe ha ga-eme.
he says.	ọ na-ekwu.
Their projects started recently.	Ọrụ ndị ha malitere na nso nso a.
It does not look good.	Ọ maghị mma.
They will not tell us why.	Ha agaghị agwa anyị ihe kpatara ya.
But this week it was once again.	Ma n'izu a ọ bụ otu mgbe ọzọ.
But that is exactly what he wants.	Ma nke ahụ bụ nnọọ ihe ọ chọrọ.
Surround you.	Gbara gị gburugburu.
That was worth it for then.	Nke ahụ bụ uru maka ya mgbe ahụ.
I do not want them.	Achọghị m ha.
You’re just a person, whether you like it or not.	Ị bụ naanị mmadụ, ma ọ masịrị gị ma ọ bụ na ị chọghị.
It's hard enough.	O siri ike zuru oke.
It is not difficult.	Ọ bụghị ihe siri ike.
No one understood the importance.	Ọ dịghị onye ghọtara na ọ dị mkpa.
First, we think, then we understand.	Nke mbụ, anyị na-eche, mgbe ahụ anyị ghọtara.
Before that, he had no idea.	Tupu nke ahụ, o nweghị echiche.
Go to work.	Gaa ọrụ.
None of the latter.	Ọ dịghị nke ikpeazụ.
These are the ones you know, these are the ones you love.	Ndị a bụ ndị ị maara, ndị a bụ ndị ị hụrụ n'anya.
The messenger directed the nation to take action.	Onye ozi ahụ gwara mba ahụ ka ha mee ihe.
But there are some truths out there.	Ma enwere ụfọdụ eziokwu n'ebe ahụ.
It’s terrifying in itself, but different.	Ọ dị oke egwu n'onwe ha, mana dị iche iche.
So much for lunch.	Nke ukwuu maka iri nri ehihie.
Money is still very important to most of us.	Ego ka dị oke mkpa maka ọtụtụ n'ime anyị.
I am his big brother.	Abụ m nnukwu nwanne ya.
They come from different backgrounds.	Ha si n'ụzọ dị iche na-abịa.
He still hates his family.	Ọ kpọrọ ezinụlọ ya asị ruo ebe a.
The money needs it.	Ego ahụ chọrọ ya.
That way, they can be used again and again.	N'ụzọ dị otú ahụ, a pụrụ iji ha mee ihe ugboro ugboro.
But then we can do something.	Ma mgbe ahụ, anyị nwere ike ime ihe.
Or suppose they have a disease inside.	Ma ọ bụ were ya na ha nwere ọrịa n'ime.
Must be new.	Ga-abụ nke ọhụrụ.
Or seeing his beautiful face.	Ma ọ bụ ịhụ ihu ya mara mma nke ukwuu.
I can’t think of what other people think of me.	Enweghị m ike iche echiche banyere ihe ndị ọzọ na-eche banyere m.
So we were set free.	Ya mere, a hapụrụ anyị ka anyị nwere onwe anyị.
He stole some money.	O zuru ego ụfọdụ.
As you can see.	Dị ka ị pụrụ ịhụ.
I do not want to know the work.	Achọghị m ịma ọrụ ahụ.
My year with him was one of my favorite football years.	Afọ mụ na ya nọ bụ otu n'ime afọ bọọlụ kacha amasị m.
Obviously this is how they do it.	O doro anya na nke a bụ otú ha si eme ya.
This will limit your chances of making a profit.	Nke a ga-eme ka ohere gị iji nweta uru kwụsị.
It has benefits.	O nwere uru.
He is not a good man at all.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo mmadụ.
This book contains all the most important types of food.	Akwụkwọ a nwere ụdị nri niile kacha mkpa.
It happens again.	Ọ na-eme ọzọ.
Do everything well.	Mee ihe niile nke ọma.
This cannot be true.	Nke a enweghị ike ịbụ eziokwu.
None of them have.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha nwere.
Who will help me?	Onye ga-enyere m aka?
He speaks.	Ọ na-ekwu okwu.
It is not a small task to make this happen.	Ọ bụghị obere ọrụ ime ka nke a mee.
It was a good plan, he told himself.	Ọ bụ atụmatụ dị mma, ọ gwara onwe ya.
But now no.	Ma ugbu a, mba.
For me it was nothing.	Maka m ọ bụghị ihe ọ bụla.
I know it should.	Ama m na o kwesịrị.
It was beautiful the first time or two.	Ọ mara mma na oge mbụ ma ọ bụ abụọ.
That annoyed, no question.	Nke ahụ were iwe, enweghị ajụjụ.
But life went on.	Ma ndụ gara n'ihu.
They are beautiful in such things.	Ha mara mma na ihe ndị dị otú ahụ.
It's like.	Ọ dị ka.
It will be very different.	Ọ ga-adị nnọọ iche.
If only they had done it better, of course.	A sị m na ha mere ya nke ọma, n'ezie.
I am not the girl.	Abụghị m nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
Many people became sick and hungry.	Ọtụtụ ndị dara ọrịa na agụụ.
I saw him do that.	Ahụrụ m ka ọ na-eme nke ahụ.
This should make them suspicious.	Nke a kwesịrị ime ka ha enyo.
Take that.	Were nke ahụ.
He wanted to be with her tonight.	Ọ chọrọ ka ya na ya nọrọ n'abalị a.
The school also has students.	Ihe ọzọ ụlọ akwụkwọ a nwere bụ ụmụ akwụkwọ.
The effect is very positive.	Mmetụta dị mma nke ukwuu.
That is an opportunity.	Nke ahụ bụ ohere.
The boat may be in danger.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ nwere ike ịnọ n'ihe egwu.
It's easy, he said.	Ọ dị mfe, o kwuru.
When it does, it can take one of three steps.	Mgbe ọ na-eme, ọ nwere ike were otu n'ime ụzọ atọ.
This city is like no other.	Obodo a dị ka nke ọ bụla ọzọ.
Only one person was allowed to leave immediately.	Naanị otu onye ka e kwere ka ọ pụọ ozugbo.
Those were tough times.	Oge ndị ahụ siri ike.
Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ọ na-eme ma mgbe ụfọdụ ọ naghị eme ya.
It looks so good in it.	Ọ mara ezigbo mma n'ime ya.
But that is.	Ma nke ahụ bụ .
The question remains.	Ajụjụ a ka dị.
It does not happen.	Ọ naghị eme.
I can't say for long.	Enweghị m ike ikwu ogologo oge.
It happened the next day.	O mere ụbọchị nke ọzọ.
You will not travel.	Ị gaghị aga njem.
Of course it did.	N'ezie o mere.
No more money.	Enweghị ego ọzọ.
You got the phone from your friend.	Ị nwetara ekwentị site na enyi gị.
Fish is meat and sweet.	Azụ bụ anụ na ụtọ.
Money is all bad.	Ego bụ ụzọ ihe ọjọọ niile.
This case is out of the question.	Ikpe a anọghị na ya.
I would have expected that.	M gaara atụ anya nke ahụ.
The villagers had a few problems.	Ndị obodo ahụ nwere nsogbu ole na ole.
It is good for us.	Ọ dị mma maka anyị.
He was sure he was.	O doro ya anya na ọ bụ ya.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
I love your students.	Enwere m mmasị maka ụmụ akwụkwọ gị.
There is no reason for it.	Enweghị ihe kpatara ya.
You are in the background.	Ị nọ n'azụ.
His perfect face is lifeless.	Ihu ya zuru oke adịghị ndụ.
They are not the only ones.	Ha abụghị naanị ebe ha nọ.
Of course, he did not really eat anything.	N'ezie, ọ dịghị eri ihe ọ bụla n'ezie.
It gave me a new life.	O nyere m ndụ ọhụrụ.
No two customers are the same.	Ọ dịghị ndị ahịa abụọ bụ otu.

Everything he said seemed logical.	Ihe ọ bụla o kwuru dị ka ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
That is your only responsibility.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị otu ọrụ gị.
The boys play soccer in the backyard.	Ụmụ nwoke na-agba bọọlụ n'azụ ụlọ.
That is a very important job.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ bara uru n'ezie.
The temperature is different here.	Okpomọkụ dị iche iche ebe a.
It’s just an idea right now.	Ọ bụ naanị echiche ugbu a.
They did not.	Ha emeghị otú ahụ.
He sang happily.	O ji obi ụtọ bụrụ abụ.

However, they did not succeed.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị na ha ga-aga nke ọma.

Often this is not a problem.	Ọtụtụ mgbe nke a abụghị nsogbu.
Insects feed on plant leaves.	Ụmụ ahụhụ na-eri nri na akwụkwọ osisi.
Not a bad word about it, of course.	Ọ bụghị okwu ọjọọ banyere ya, n'ezie.
Really try.	Na-agbalị n'ezie.
But there was nothing that they could do about it.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ha nwere ike ime banyere ya.

Everything went well during my pregnancy and pregnancy.	Ihe niile na-aga nke ọma n'oge ime na ime m.

Bad month, that is.	Ọnwa ọjọọ, nke ahụ bụ.
They know my actions.	Ha maara omume m.
I do not understand why any of you did.	Aghọtaghị m ihe kpatara onye ọ bụla n'ime unu ji mee.
The reason for this is uncertain.	Ihe kpatara nke a ejighị n'aka.
And how happy we are.	Na otú anyị si enwe obi ụtọ.
They will not run.	Ha agaghị agba ọsọ.
He does everything he says he does.	Ọ na-eme ihe niile o kwuru na ọ na-eme.
The city is on the side of the river.	Obodo dị n’akụkụ ụzọ osimiri ahụ.
He never asked me for any money, nor did I buy anything for him.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ jụrụ m ego ọ bụla, ma ọ bụ zụta ya ihe ọ bụla.
His words gave many hope.	Okwu ya mere ka ọtụtụ ndị nwee olileanya.

Hope it was helpful and helpful.	Na-atụ anya na ọ bara uru ma nyere aka.
But they may not have the complete story.	Ma ha nwere ike ha enweghị akụkọ zuru oke.

We started playing.	Anyị malitere igwu egwu.
They come, they go, but when they go, it will be fine.	Ha na-abịa, ha na-aga, ma mgbe ha na-aga, ọ ga-adị mma.
A lot of things happen right away.	Ọtụtụ ihe na-eme ozugbo.

In one sense, they were right.	N'otu echiche, ha kwuru eziokwu.
His heart sank.	Obi ya dara ngwa ngwa.
But they did not know what to do.	Ma ha amaghị ihe ha ga-eme.

It is best not to think too hard about this.	Ọ kacha mma ka ị ghara iche echiche nke ọma banyere nke a.
But it's beautiful, not cruel.	Ma ọ mara mma, ọ bụghị obi ọjọọ.
You can do anything but do it well.	Ị nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla ma ọ na-eme nke ahụ nke ọma.
The muscles of the legs are strong.	Anụ ahụ nke ụkwụ dị ike.

But in this case, his life was better.	Ma n'oge a, ndụ ya dị ya mma.
The company's profits fell.	Uru ụlọ ọrụ ahụ dara.

Now, this is my second opinion.	Ugbu a, nke a bụ echiche nke abụọ m.

You do well, you do what you do.	Ị na-eme nke ọma, na-eme ihe ị na-eme.
What matters is what he did to them '.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ ihe o mere ha'.
It is very beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
Today is a big day.	Taa bụ nnukwu ụbọchị.
He told himself that.	Ọ gwara onwe ya nke ahụ.
They may look for ways to achieve this.	Ha nwere ike chọọ ụzọ ha ga-esi nweta nke a.
Should be made simple.	Kwesịrị ime ka ọ dị mfe.
I saw that.	Ahụrụ m nke ahụ.
Eat well and stay healthy.	Rie nri dị mma ma nọrọ nke ọma.
He looked at his watch.	O lere elekere aka ya anya.
Suddenly he was sick.	Na mberede nwere ọrịa.
You can't do both.	Ị nweghị ike ime ha abụọ.
It went a long way.	Ọ gara n'ihu nke ukwuu.
Stop it now!	Kwụsị ya ugbu a!
It is four o'clock in the morning.	Ọ bụ n'elekere anọ nke ụtụtụ.
The three bags.	Akpa atọ ahụ.
Only a few are at a distance.	Naanị ụfọdụ ndị nọ n'ebe dị anya.
The group was facing difficulties.	Ndị otu ahụ nọ na-eche ihe isi ike ihu.
That is good.	Ihe ahụ dị mma.
No time for other things.	Enweghị oge maka ihe ndị ọzọ.
I had a wonderful time.	Enwere m oge mara mma.
It does not happen by accident.	Ọ naghị eme na mberede.
The picture is true.	Foto bụ eziokwu.
The one who gave it was his father.	Onye nyere ya bụ nna ya.
This is like that.	Nke a dị ka nke ahụ.
He is my friend by size and need.	Ọ bụ enyi m site na oke na mkpa.
Now tell me something else.	Ugbu a gwa m ihe ọzọ.
Yours is what I like.	Nke gị bụ ihe masịrị m.
One happiness left me.	Otu obi ụtọ hapụrụ m.
We will do this.	Anyị ga-eme nke a.
For each of us.	Maka onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị.
The plane landed on the moon.	Ụgbọ elu ụgbọ elu rutere na ọnwa.
The key word or this is the mind.	Isi okwu ma ọ bụ nke a bụ uche.
Not that they can see much here.	Ọ bụghị na ha nwere ike ịhụ ọtụtụ ihe n'ebe a.
I came out of nowhere.	M wee si amaghị ama.
Speaking before the fight.	Na-ekwu tupu ọgụ.
But nothing was given.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe nyere.
It is easy to use.	Ọ dị mfe iji.
Nothing.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla.
The women are sure.	Ụmụ nwanyị ahụ ji ya n'aka.
Where I am close to it.	Ebe m dị nso na ya.
Makes you think.	Na-eme ka ị na-eche.
The worst winter of the year.	Oge oyi kacha njọ na afọ.
The girls had their own room to stay in.	Ụmụ agbọghọ ahụ nwere ọnụ ụlọ nke ha ha ga-anọ.
You are useful if you plan ahead.	Ị bara uru ma ị na-eme atụmatụ n'ihu.
The simple machine works well.	Igwe dị mfe na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
That kind of thing is simple.	Ụdị ahụ bụ ihe dị mfe.
They go.	Ha na-aga.
The weather is unpredictable here.	Ọnọdụ ihu igwe enweghị atụ ebe a.
It's like someone else.	Ọ dị ka onye ọzọ.
Hard work is what he needs now.	Ọrụ siri ike bụ ihe dị ya mkpa ugbu a.
But then after dinner.	Ma mgbe ahụ, mgbe nri abalị.
I would like to help in any way I can.	Ọ ga-amasị m inye aka n'ụzọ ọ bụla m nwere ike.
It is only real if both people think so.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe dị adị ma ọ bụrụ na mmadụ abụọ ahụ chere ya.
Just one word.	Naanị otu okwu.
Old.	Ochie.
The truth is the truth.	Eziokwu bụ eziokwu.
I never wanted to go there before.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chọrọ ịga ebe ahụ na mbụ.
The reason is good.	Ihe kpatara ya dị mma.
It is perfect.	O zuru oke.
He will want to.	Ọ ga-achọ.
When you play sports you will be good.	Mgbe ị na-eme egwuregwu ị ga-adị mma.
So much for my opinion.	Nke ukwuu echiche m.
Some are eating, some are eating.	Ụfọdụ si na-eri ihe, ụfọdụ si na-eri.
You know you need one.	Ị maara na ị chọrọ otu.
I think he valued his own name.	Echere m na o ji aha nke ya kpọrọ ihe.
Now is the time.	Ugbu a ọ bụ oge ya.
They had one child.	Ha mụrụ otu nwa.
He should not go to the side.	O kwesịghị ịga n'akụkụ.
The dead are.	Ndị nwụrụ anwụ bụ.
Good country, that’s real.	Ezigbo mba, nke ahụ bụ ezigbo.
Everything in his house is important.	Ihe ọ bụla dị n'ụlọ ya dị mkpa.
I will stay in my old town.	Aga m anọ na obodo ochie m.
I just sat there.	M nnọọ nọdụ ebe ahụ.
I don't want to be here.	Achọghị m ịnọ ebe a.
And also the first dance.	Na kwa nke mbụ ịgba egwu.
But what if.	Ma gịnị ma ọ bụrụ.
I don’t know anyone else can, but maybe.	Amaghị m onye ọ bụla ọzọ nwere ike, mana enwere ike.
I was terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ m.
He was repeatedly told that he was a fool.	A gwara ya ugboro ugboro na ọ bụ onye nzuzu.
We can travel.	Anyị nwere ike ime njem.
I am not confident in myself.	Enweghị m obi ike na onwe m.
He said where he was going.	O kwuru ebe ọ na-aga.
It has something old and new.	O nwere ihe nke ochie na nke ọhụrụ.
He would never experience such a thing in his life.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-enwe ụdị ihe ahụ ná ndụ ya.
But this is not an immediate case.	Mana nke a abụghị ikpe ozugbo.
I think it is unique.	Echere m na ọ pụrụ iche.
This needs to be talked about.	Nke a dị mkpa ka a na-ekwu maka ya.
Maybe there is something else in it.	Ma eleghị anya, e nwere ihe ọzọ na ya.
The game is everything.	Egwuregwu ahụ bụ ihe niile.
Others fled for their lives.	Ndị ọzọ gbara ọsọ ndụ ha.
He obviously did not want to be inside.	O doro anya na ọ chọghị ịnọ n'ime.
They are on vacation.	Ha nọ na ezumike.
Many other examples can be found.	Enwere ike ịchọta ọtụtụ ihe atụ ndị ọzọ.
You are not the first one.	Ị bụghị onye mbụ.
There are only a few games.	Enwere naanị egwuregwu ole na ole.
You should not act hastily.	I kwesịghị ime ngwa ngwa ime ihe ozugbo.
He did not know about it.	Ọ maghị banyere ya.
Let's go out to dinner today.	Ka anyị pụọ iri nri abalị taa.
As we know, none exist.	Dị ka anyị maara, ọ dịghị nke dị.
Probably not.	Eleghị ha anya.
That is a very foolish idea.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ nzuzu echiche.
But that is not the main reason why we are here.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị isi ihe mere anyị ji nọrọ ebe a.
And just to see where your strengths lie.	Na naanị ịhụ ebe ike gị dị.
It is my face.	Ọ bụ ihu m.
This cannot be.	Nke a enweghị ike ịbụ ya.
Hardly anyone swims during the summer months.	O siri ike onye ọ bụla na-egwu mmiri n'oge ọnwa okpomọkụ.
He never does it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-eme ya.
He eventually got to his classmates.	O mechara nweta ụmụ akwụkwọ ibe ya.
They got the job.	Ha nwetara ọrụ ahụ.
Kind of before any of us know.	Ụdị tupu onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị mara.
I will not allow it.	Agaghị m ekwe ya.
He came.	Ọ bịara.
Others are new.	Ndị ọzọ dị ọhụrụ.
As if he did not really know if anything really happened.	Dị ka ọ bụ na ọ maghị n'ezie ma ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla na-eme n'ezie.
It's pretty high.	Ọ mara mma elu.
No, more than that.	Mba, karịa nke ahụ.
I know you do your best.	Ama m na ị na-eme ike gị.
These teams are happy.	Ndị otu a na-enwe obi ụtọ.
They are all ten.	Ha niile dị iri.
It's an old car.	Ọ bụ ụgbọ ala ochie.
I think you said that.	Echere m na ị kwuru nke ahụ.
They are ready and waiting.	Ha dị njikere ma chere.
Both seem logical.	Ha abụọ yiri ezi uche.
He has no brother.	O nweghị nwanne.
He did not know how to reach a new destination.	Ọ maghị ka ọ ga-esi ruo ebe ọhụrụ.
It’s a lot of things right away.	Ọ bụ ọtụtụ ihe ozugbo.
He saw two people in the car.	Ọ hụrụ mmadụ abụọ n’ime ụgbọ ala ahụ.
A small amount of money for my life.	Ọnụ ego dị nta maka ndụ m.
I did nothing wrong.	Ọ dịghị ihe m mere ya.
However, two years.	Otú ọ dị, afọ abụọ.
Keep newspapers simple and easy.	Mee ka akwụkwọ akụkọ dị mfe ma dị mfe.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
Now we both go on, or else.	Ugbu a, anyị ma na-aga n'ihu, ma ọ bụ ọzọ.
Price is important.	Ọnụ ahịa dị mkpa.
This machine is expensive.	Igwe a dị oke ọnụ.
Who are the two people in the picture?	Ole ndị bụ mmadụ abụọ nọ na foto a?
However, this is not a question.	Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị ajụjụ.
As we are.	Dị ka anyị bụ.
And this is no better than now.	Na nke a adịghị mma karịa ugbu a.
Just a day or two.	Naanị otu ụbọchị ma ọ bụ abụọ.
The city needs good travel, he said,	Obodo a chọrọ njem njem nke ọma, ka o kwuru,
They are very bad for each other.	Ha bụ nnọọ ihe ọjọọ maka ibe ha.
The water is bad.	Mmiri ahụ adịghị mma.
He said that this could be one of my strong points.	O kwuru na nke a nwere ike ịbụ otu n'ime isi okwu m siri ike.
It will be expensive.	Ọ ga-adị ọnụ.
Both at work and at home.	Ma n'ebe ọrụ ma n'ụlọ.
We knew it was something else.	Anyị maara na ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
Are you in the game tonight?	Ị nọ na egwuregwu n'abalị a?.
Their lives are for the better and the better in it.	Ndụ ha bụ maka ịdị mma na mma na ya.
Not all people live or work near the city.	Ọ bụghị mmadụ niile bi ma ọ bụ na-arụ ọrụ na nso obodo.
There is nothing here, nothing.	Enweghị ihe ọ bụla ebe a, ọ dịghị ihe.
But think of something else.	Ma chere na e nwere ihe ọzọ.
They love each other very much.	Ha hụrụ ibe ha n’anya nke ukwuu.
I know he heard some of the fights.	Ama m na ọ nụrụ ụfọdụ ọgụ ahụ.
You may need a vacation.	Ị nwere ike ịchọrọ ezumike.
I think it is.	Echere m na ọ bụ ya.
The game continued.	Egwuregwu ahụ gara n'ihu.
He looked at it carefully.	O lere ya anya nke ọma.
You and your sister.	Gị na nwanne gị nwanyị.
That is my job.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ m.
Another day, another hour, another minute.	Ụbọchị ọzọ, awa ọzọ, nkeji ọzọ.
I do the same.	Nke m na-eme otu ihe ahụ.
Alone alone is perfect.	Ịnọ naanị ya zuru oke.
School night.	Abalị ụlọ akwụkwọ.
The long way.	Ụzọ dị anya.
I want to feel whatever.	Achọrọ m inwe mmetụta ọ bụla.
I knew what to do.	Amaara m ihe m ga-eme.
Just do such things, over and over again.	Naanị na-eme ihe ndị dị otú ahụ, ugboro ugboro.
If we’re with a girl, it doesn’t work.	Ọ bụrụ na anyị na otu nwa agbọghọ nọ, ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
Many opportunities will come your way.	Ọtụtụ ohere ga-abịa n'ụzọ gị.
The boss is strong.	Onye isi ahụ siri ike.
If we’re on the same page, it’s awesome.	Ọ bụrụ na anyị nọ n'otu ibe, ọ bụ ihe dị egwu.
Everything if.	Ihe niile ma ọ bụrụ.
But not my house.	Mana ọ bụghị ụlọ m.
It would not be good for any of them.	Ọ gaghị adị mma maka nke ọ bụla n'ime ha.
I have no more chance for it or anything else.	Enweghị m ohere ọzọ maka ya ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
I do not want.	Achọghị m.
This does not seem to me.	Nke a adịghị ka m.
I have a baby at home.	Enwere m nwa n'ụlọ.
Or ordered clothing.	Ma ọ bụ uwe e nyere iwu.
He saw the truth about himself.	Ọ hụrụ eziokwu banyere onwe ya.
They should not be too small.	Ha ekwesịghị ịbụ nke dị ntakịrị ntakịrị.
In this age of human history, mankind has achieved great things.	N'ime oge a nke akụkọ ihe mere eme nke mmadụ, ụmụ mmadụ nwetara nnukwu ihe.
The boat docked.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ kwụsịrị.

I know the man.	Amaara m nwoke.
It's really stupid.	Ọ bụ n'ezie nzuzu.
Call me her baby.	Ịkpọ m nwa ya.
People should only be seen as people.	Ekwesịrị ịhụ ndị mmadụ naanị ka ndị mmadụ.
In your ear.	N'ime ntị gị.
The president did not.	Onye isi ala emeghị.
That seems to be working well.	Nke ahụ yiri ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Names are not good.	Aha aha adịghị mma.
I'm not very sure.	Ejighị m n'aka nke ukwuu.
One girl ran away with another boy.	Otu nwa agbọghọ ya na nwa nwoke ọzọ gbara ọsọ.
We want to find that perfect.	Anyị chọrọ ịchọta nke ahụ zuru oke.
In the car.	N'ime ụgbọ ala.
Money still does not go as planned.	Ego ka anaghị aga dị ka ozi.
Now he does not do that.	Ugbu a ọ naghị eme otú ahụ.
It's about two girls.	Ọ bụ ihe dị ka ụmụ agbọghọ abụọ.
I can not tell you the rules.	Enweghị m ike ịgwa gị iwu.
I like it there.	Ha na-amasị m ebe ahụ.
What we know to be true is not true.	Ihe anyị ma na ọ bụ eziokwu abụghị eziokwu.
That is not possible here.	Nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume ebe a.
Low and almost scary.	Dị ala na ọ fọrọ nke nta ka egwu.
It was premature, but he knew the story.	Ọ bụ tupu oge ya, ma ọ maara akụkọ ahụ.
Again, you have a chance at this.	Ọzọ, ị nwere ohere na nke a.
Everyone knows how to do this.	Onye ọ bụla maara otú e kwesịrị isi mee nke a.
It is not a great work of greatness.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu ọrụ nke ịdị ukwuu.
You know their strengths and weaknesses.	Ị maara ebe ha siri ike na adịghị ike ha.
Take your monster with you.	Were nnukwu anụ gị na gị.
They are only one foot away.	Ha dị naanị otu ụkwụ.
The dress made it look beautiful.	Uwe ahụ mere ka ọ mara mma.
Probably not by accident.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị na mberede.
You have a good job and a nice house.	Ị nwere ezigbo ọrụ na ụlọ mara mma.
He understood this.	Ọ ghọtara nke a.
I can not do this.	Enweghị m ike ime nke a.
We have a lot of history behind us.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ akụkọ ihe mere eme n'azụ anyị.
Have fun, everyone !.	Nwee egwu, onye ọ bụla!.
He made me smile.	O mere m ọnụ ọchị.
This could be it.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ ya.
But if there is no hunger, nothing happens.	Ma ọ bụrụ na agụụ adịghị, ọ dịghị ihe na-eme.
They are most interested in making you money.	Ha kacha nwee mmasị ime gị ego.
You do it every day.	Ị na-eme ya kwa ụbọchị.
One man has a better chance.	Otu nwoke nwere ohere ka mma.
They have four children together.	Ha nwere ụmụ anọ ọnụ.
Maybe people are really happy for you.	Ma eleghị anya ndị mmadụ nwere ezi obi ụtọ maka gị.
Not serious, he understood.	Ọ bụghị kpọrọ ihe, ọ ghọtara.
Ground water.	Ala mmiri mmiri.
I am not too angry about this.	Adịghị m oke iwe na nke a.
That was an important moment for me.	Nke ahụ bụ oge dị mkpa nye m.
My thoughts started to run.	Echiche m malitere ịgba ọsọ.
Such a friend does.	Otu enyi dị otú ahụ mere otú ahụ.
A good family idea.	Ezigbo echiche ezinụlọ.
I do not know the word.	Amaghị m okwu ahụ.
Succeed.	Gaa nke ọma.
I know it happened to me.	Ama m na o mere m.
It is only with the event that it can make such sense.	Ọ bụ naanị na ihe omume nwere ike ime ka uche dị otú ahụ.
It is mental.	Ọ bụ uche n'ihe.
It works well, everything works as it should.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma, ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ dị ka o kwesịrị.
The other is better.	Nke ọzọ ka mma.
She never said a word.	O nweghị mgbe o kwuru echiche ọ bụla.
It was some great time.	Ọ bụ ụfọdụ nnukwu oge.
Of course it is.	N'ezie ọ bụ.
It can be seen in the background.	Enwere ike ịhụ ya n'azụ.
You will not do anything.	Ị gaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.
The obvious thing.	Ihe doro anya.
Far from home, my father travels with me.	N'ebe dị anya site n'ụlọ, nna m na-eme njem m.
This should not be the case.	Nke a ekwesịghị ịdị otú ahụ.
All eyes were on her.	Anya mmadụ niile gbara ya gburugburu.
It really is something.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ihe.
Tom looked around.	Tom lere anya gburugburu.
I could see my hands and arms suddenly in front of me.	Enwere m ike ịhụ aka na aka m na mberede n'ihu m.
Never do it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ime ya.
One of these is homelessness.	Otu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ enweghị ụlọ.
Can't find it for talking.	Enweghị ike ịchọta ya maka ikwu okwu.
Often, they are not good people.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ha abụghị ezigbo mmadụ.
He is too far away to do anything else.	Ọ nọ ebe dị anya nke ukwuu ime ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
Only a few of us were there, about twenty.	Naanị mmadụ ole na ole n'ime anyị nọ ebe ahụ, ihe dị ka iri abụọ.
The places are the best.	Ebe ndị ahụ bụ ebe kacha mma.
I do not understand what happened tonight.	Aghọtaghị m ihe ọ bụla mere n'abalị a.
No breakfast for me.	Enweghị nri ụtụtụ maka m.
The boat took almost two weeks to sail.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ were ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ izu abụọ iji ụgbọ mmiri.
But the other three are not.	Ma atọ ndị ọzọ abụghị.
We all have a great time.	Anyị niile nwere ezigbo oge.

Well, you asked for it.	Ọ dị mma, ị jụrụ ya.
I think those kids are doing something.	Echere m na ụmụaka ndị ahụ na-eme ihe.
I do not want to be.	Achọghị m ịbụ.
Most likely.	O yikarịrị ka ọ dị.
They are twelve.	Ha dị iri na abụọ.
It will help.	Ọ ga-enyere aka.
Ever since your mother died.	Kemgbe nne gị nwụrụ.
This is a perfect boat landing.	Nke a bụ ala njem ụgbọ mmiri zuru oke.
Everything has no weight.	Ihe niile enweghị ibu.
It is a disease just like any other disease.	Ọ bụ ọrịa dị ka ọrịa ọ bụla ọzọ.
We cannot continue like this.	Anyị enweghị ike ịga n'ihu otu a.
You can still travel you know.	Ị ka nwere ike ime njem ị maara.
Very well.	Ọ dị mma nke ukwuu.
There are.	Enwere.
But he had a good day.	Ma o nwere ezigbo ụbọchị.

Not by cold.	Ọ bụghị site na oyi.

Thanks reader for the information !.	Daalụ onye na-agụ maka ozi!.
We are friends, but we are very different.	Anyị bụ enyi, ma anyị dị nnọọ iche.
The ground is hard and pointless to move forward.	Ala siri ike na enweghị isi ịga n'ihu.
I am very small.	Adị m nnọọ obere.
We can call it that.	Anyị nwere ike ịkpọ ya.
There were no accidents.	Enweghị ihe mberede.
It is true.	Ọ bụ eziokwu.
He had a sense of running.	O nwere mmetụta nke ịgba ọsọ.
Only room is better.	Naanị ụlọ ka mma.
He asked us what was going on.	Ọ jụrụ anyị ihe na-eme.
It simply does not exist.	Ọ dịghị adị n'ezie ma ọlị.
They know this.	Ha maara nke a.
They were the first travelers to arrive there.	Ha bụ ndị njem mbụ rutere ebe ahụ.
I don’t think so, but we can have.	Echeghị m nke ahụ, ma anyị nwere ike inwe.
This is just his friend.	Naanị nke a bụ enyi ya.
What is, is.	Gịnị bụ, bụ.
He asked if she was alone.	Ọ jụrụ ma ọ̀ nọ naanị ya.
We know it.	Anyị maara ya.
Both jobs should run on different threads.	Ọrụ abụọ a kwesịrị ịgba ọsọ na eri dị iche iche.
I do that sometimes.	Ana m eme nke ahụ mgbe ụfọdụ.
For you and others.	Maka gị na ndị ọzọ.
But he certainly would not do that.	Ma n'ezie ọ gaghị eme nke ahụ.
He did not know.	Ọ maghị.
Some of them do not know who he is.	Ụfọdụ n’ime ha amaghị onye ọ bụ.
He may have it again.	O nwere ike inwe ọzọ.
News at the door.	Akụkọ n'ọnụ ụzọ.
I want to know.	Achọrọ m ịma.
I kicked a little.	M gbara ntakịrị ụkwụ.
That is very good.	Nke ahụ dị ezigbo mma.
The eyes are very clear.	Anya bụ nnọọ anya.
Twenty months ago.	Ọnwa iri abụọ gara aga.
At least that is what he understands.	Ma ọ́ dịghị ihe ọzọ, nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ ghọtara.
It’s so much bigger.	Ọ ka ukwuu nke ukwuu.
I don’t know how long this holiday will last.	Amaghị m ogologo oge ezumike a ga-adị.
Still there seems to be no reason to shout.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ihe kpatara mkpu.
His car has a lot of space and is very good.	Ụgbọ ala ya nwere ọtụtụ ohere ma dị nnọọ mma.
His words burned.	Okwu ya gbara ọkụ.
This game can be played with others.	Enwere ike ịkpọ egwuregwu a na ndị ọzọ.
He was in the same boat.	Ọ nọ n'otu ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
This will be done with or without load orders.	Nke a ga-eme ma ọ bụ na-enweghị iwu ibu ibe.
They don't want me around.	Ha achọghị m nso.
I think we will.	Echere m na anyị ga-eme.
Nothing more.	O nweghị ihe ọzọ.
But no one wants it.	Ma ọ dịghị onye chọrọ ya.
This holiday season will be a lot of fun.	Oge ezumike a ga-abụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
Lots and lots of travel.	Ọtụtụ na ọtụtụ njem.
He could see them but they did not see him.	O nwere ike ịhụ ha mana ha ahụghị ya.
He looks at them carefully.	O lere ha anya nke ọma.
I was there.	Anọ m ebe ahụ.
I think it's a funny thing.	Echere m na ọ bụ okwu na-atọ ọchị.
They know where we are going.	Ha ma ebe anyị ga-aga.
Parents and their children.	Ndị nne na nna na ụmụ ha.
There is no way.	Enweghị ụzọ ọ bụla.
You think you know what they are doing.	Ị chere na ị maara ihe ha na-eme.
He was just a man.	Ọ bụ naanị nwoke.
I'll get out of there quickly, though.	Aga m esi ebe ahụ ngwa ngwa, n'agbanyeghị.
It can be anyone.	O nwere ike ịbụ onye ọ bụla.
The difficulty is not being able to do it.	Ihe isi ike bụ enweghị ike ime ya.
Two of them received three such gifts.	Abụọ n'ime ha nwetara onyinye atọ dị otú ahụ.
The fire broke out.	Ọkụ gbara n'ime ọkụ.
He is wearing a police uniform.	O yi uwe ojii.
He is a good student.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwa akwụkwọ.

They say the skin is hard.	Ha na-ekwu na akpụkpọ ahụ siri ike.
Only friends are at home.	Naanị enyi nọ n'ụlọ.
There is nothing special about seeing it in the future.	Ọ dịghị ihe pụrụ iche banyere ịhụ ya n'ihu.
There is something new.	Enwere ihe ọhụrụ.

She is still a woman.	Ọ bụ nwanyị ka nọ.
No one said anything, he told himself.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru ihe ọ bụla, ọ gwara onwe ya.
It is not good for him.	Ọ dịghị mma nye ya.
It was a difficult journey, but it was worth it.	Ọ bụ njem siri ike, ma ọ bara uru.
Their influence continues today.	Mmetụta ha na-aga n'ihu taa.
Then he looked at the things.	Mgbe ahụ, o lere ihe ndị ahụ anya.
That's what he called it.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ kpọrọ ya.
The assembly surrounded him.	Nzukọ ahụ gbara ya gburugburu.
The car does not have.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ enweghị.

The news is bad.	Akụkọ ahụ dị njọ.
This is our life and we love what we do.	Nke a bụ ndụ anyị na anyị hụrụ ihe anyị na-eme n'anya.
A good home can make a person happy.	Ụlọ dị mma nwere ike ime mmadụ obi ụtọ.
But I don't think it worked.	Ma echeghị m na ọ gara nke ọma.
It is a false message.	Ọ bụ ozi ụgha.

We will not do anything.	Anyị agaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.

Friends speak all your languages.	Enyi na-asụ asụsụ gị niile.
I did it twice.	M mere ugboro abụọ.
Very beautiful.	Mara mma nke ukwuu.
No weapons or other items were found.	Ọ dịghị ngwa ọgụ ma ọ bụ ihe ndị ọzọ ahụrụ.
It is a dead tree.	Ọ bụ osisi na-adịghị ndụ.
A few months.	Ọnwa ole na ole.
And also, that there is more.	Na kwa, na e nwere ọzọ.
Some words may do that.	Okwu ụfọdụ nwere ike ime nke ahụ.
So there is great excitement.	Ya mere e nwere nnukwu obi ụtọ.
Of course it is.	N'ezie, ọ bụ.
Hopefully, one day this fight will happen.	Olileanya, otu ụbọchị ọgụ a ga-eme.
It looks like you belong to it.	Ọ dị ka ị bụ nke ya.
It is difficult to think clearly.	O siri ike iche echiche nke ọma.
Not because it’s perfect.	Ọ bụghị n'ihi na ọ zuru oke.
That is the right thing to do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe kwesịrị ime.
It made a real difference in my life.	O mere ka ndụ m nwee mmetụta pụrụ iche.
Of course in this man.	N'ezie n'ime nwoke a.
It helped a lot.	O nyere aka nke ukwuu.

There were so many things happening in my life.	E nwere ihe dị iche iche na-eme ná ndụ m.

A few small ones.	Obere ole na ole.
We were given a small amount of money.	E nyere anyị obere ego.
Tell them you love them and that everything will be all right.	Gwa ha na ị hụrụ ha n'anya na ihe niile ga-adị mma.
I hope we will not see any events tonight.	Enwere m olileanya na anyị agaghị ahụ ihe omume ọ bụla n'abalị a.
It looked like leather boots and leather bags.	O yiri akpụkpọ ụkwụ akpụkpọ anụ na akpa akpụkpọ anụ.
The first is the spread.	Nke mbụ bụ gbasara.
Pregnancy is my thing.	Ime bụ ihe m.
A once in a lifetime opportunity.	A otu ugboro na a ndụ ohere.
Of course they are not good here.	N'ezie na ha adịghị mma ebe a.
He loved his wife and children very much.	Ọ hụrụ nwunye ya na ụmụ ya n’anya nke ukwuu.
I can't think of anyone.	Enweghị m ike iche maka onye ọ bụla.
Which one is true?	Kedu nke bụ eziokwu?
Maybe a couple.	Ma eleghị anya, di na nwunye.
The advantage here is speed.	Uru ebe a bụ ọsọ.
Therefore, the application effect is better.	Ya mere, mmetụta ngwa ya ka mma.
There are no tests.	Enweghị ule ọ bụla.
Locals can use those.	Ndị obodo nwere ike iji ndị ahụ.
In this case, the situation is different.	Na nke ugbu a, ọnọdụ dị iche.
I know how you feel, boy.	Ama m ka ọ dị gị, nwa nwoke.
You are in good hands.	Ị nọ na ezigbo aka.
I just say, get some at any price.	Naanị m na-ekwu, nweta ụfọdụ n'ọnụ ahịa ọ bụla.
That was my worst.	Nke ahụ bụ m kacha njọ.
It will be difficult for a long time.	Ọ ga-esi ike ruo ogologo oge.
Is that you?	Ọ bụ gị n'ezie?
I am still one of 'us'.	M ka bụ otu n'ime 'anyị'.
That could be.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ.
He was afraid he would not believe it.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya na ya agaghị ekwe ya.
That should not be the case.	Nke ahụ ekwesịghị ịdị ebe ahụ.
Both are everywhere.	Ha abụọ dị n'ebe niile.
Everything is in place, he said.	Ihe niile bụ ebe kwesịrị ịdị, o kwuru.
To get a job he made people know who he was.	Iji nweta ọrụ ọ mere ka ndị mmadụ mara onye ọ bụ.
So we did three things.	Ya mere, anyị mere ụzọ atọ.
The language is thought to have originated.	A na-eche na asụsụ malitere.
I do not understand the basic diet.	Aghọtaghị m ụdị nri bụ isi.
He lives with his uncle.	Ya na nwanne nna ya bi nso.
Coffee is a drink.	Kọfị bụ ihe ọṅụṅụ.
Not just on the track.	Ọ bụghị naanị na egwu ahụ.
We know how to do it better than anyone.	Anyị maara ka esi eme ya karịa onye ọ bụla.
However, there was no relief for him.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị enyemaka maka ya.
The mother did not know about the pregnancy.	Nne ahụ amaghị banyere ime nwa ya nwanyị.
Everything that always happens has a reason, a reason.	Ihe ọ bụla na-eme mgbe niile nwere ihe kpatara ya, ihe kpatara ya.
He is the only one.	Ọ bụ naanị ya.
She wants to go with him.	Ọ chọrọ iso ya gaa.
Head of state, is my gift.	Onye isi ala, bụ onyinye m.
You need it now.	Ị chọrọ ya ugbu a.
On the other hand we face a different situation.	N'ụzọ ọzọ anyị na-eche ọnọdụ dị iche ihu.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
She saw that her daughter was just weak and weak.	Ọ hụrụ na nwa ya nwanyị naanị adịghị ike na adịghị ike.
This is one of the smallest species.	Nke a bụ otu n'ime ụdị ọmụmụ kacha nta.
One day a new accident happened.	Otu ụbọchị ihe mberede ọhụrụ mere.
I have a wife, a baby and someone else on the way.	Enwere m nwunye, nwa ọhụrụ na onye ọzọ n'ụzọ.
No one knows what they are doing.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ihe ha na-eme.
The workers donated money.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ nyere ha onyinye ego.
Their shoes are like water.	Akpụkpọ ụkwụ ha yiri mmiri.
Only something else has.	Naanị ihe ọzọ nwere.
That is very important to me.	Nke ahụ dị m ezigbo mkpa.
It is impossible to be true.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume ịbụ eziokwu.
Not really long.	Anọghị ogologo oge n'ezie.
The lighthouse provided a boat path.	Ụlọ ọkụ ahụ nyere ụzọ ụgbọ mmiri.
This hasn't happened in a long time here.	Nke a emeghị ogologo oge ebe a.
Maybe some sort of thing.	Ma eleghị anya, ihe ụfọdụ dị otú ahụ.
Because that is what he should do.	N'ihi na nke ahụ bụ ihe o kwesịrị ime.
Each city has its own style of music.	Obodo ọ bụla nwere ụdị egwu nke ya.
It needs water.	Mmiri chọrọ ya.
It is clear what happened to them.	O doro anya ihe mere ha.
That thing is special.	Ihe ahụ pụrụ iche.
You can stay there as long as you want.	Ị nwere ike ịnọ ebe ahụ ogologo oge ịchọrọ.
Certainly not a function of my imagination here.	N'ezie ọ nweghị ọrụ nke echiche m ebe a.
You should not tell anyone.	I kwesịghị ịgwa onye ọ bụla.
There is no limit.	O nweghị oke.
Most of the time.	Ka ukwuu oge a.
You want something better.	Ị chọrọ ihe ka mma.

Let the dancers do the same.	Ka ndị mara ịgba egwu mee otú ahụ.
Things are well known, but from a long time ago.	Ihe maara nke ọma, mana site na ogologo oge gara aga.
He understood that over the years.	Ọ ghọtara nke ahụ kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
There are restaurants on every side.	Enwere ụlọ nri n'akụkụ ọ bụla.
My wife does not.	Nwunye m anaghị eme ya.
But this did not make sense to me.	Ma nke a enweghị isi nye m.
Maybe someone, please tell me the best way to do this.	Enwere ike mmadụ, biko gwa m ụzọ kacha mma isi mee nke a.
I think this may be just a little bit.	Echere m na nke a nwere ike ịbụ naanị ntakịrị.
I'm afraid no one.	Ana m atụ egwu ọ dịghị mmadụ.
You understand what work is.	Ị ghọtara ihe ọrụ bụ.
Do what pleases you.	Mee ihe dị gị mma.
Unhappy.	Enweghị obi ụtọ.
It will make him feel better.	Ọ ga-eme ka ahụ dị ya mma.
The city is famous for its beauty.	Obodo a ma ama maka ịma mma ya.
The leaders are making their way.	Ndị isi na-eme ụzọ.
Just give them what they want.	Naanị nye ha ihe ha chọrọ.
Many women are aware of this.	Ọtụtụ ụmụ nwanyị maara ụdị ihe a.
Did your husband say that about my work?	Di gị kwuru nke ahụ gbasara ọrụ m?
They are going home.	Ha na-aga ịla.

This is why we plan for ourselves.	Nke a bụ ihe kpatara anyị na-eme atụmatụ maka onwe anyị.

But then.	Ma, mgbe ahụ.
I know it will be good.	Ama m na ọ ga-adị mma.
Take their views seriously.	Were echiche ha kpọrọ ihe.
However, this situation is different.	Otú ọ dị, ọnọdụ a dị iche.
Time to go home.	Oge ịla n'ụlọ.
I have money.	Enwere m ego.
It is the core of the head.	Ọ bụ isi nke isi.
They were looking for a new president.	Ha nọ na-achọ nnukwu onye isi ala ọhụrụ.
It is important to tell the truth.	Ọ dị mkpa ikwu eziokwu.
Nothing else is available.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ dị.

He said it was him.	O kwuru na ọ bụ ya.
And they helped him.	Ha wee nyere ya aka.
I am here to help.	Anọ m ebe a iji nyere aka.

We are not angry or anything.	Anyị enweghị iwe ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.

She liked the strong masculine nature.	Ọ masịrị ya omume nwoke siri ike.

He wants you.	Ọ chọrọ gị.
He is just an incomparable man.	Ọ bụ naanị mmadụ na-enweghị atụ.

He loves her very much.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.

Within the action layer is different.	N'ime oyi akwa omume dị iche.
You know it's our pleasure.	Ị mara mma na ọ bụ obi ụtọ anyị.
All of this has an interesting message.	Ihe ndị a niile nwere ozi na-atọ ụtọ.
I would like to.	Ọ ga-amasị m.
Clearly, they are not on the same page.	O doro anya na ha anọghị n'otu ibe.
It is so.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
The hearing continued for a few days.	Ntị ahụ gara n'ihu ruo ụbọchị ole na ole.
He stole his mother's money.	O zuru ego nne ya.
He thinks too much of himself.	Ọ na-eche banyere onwe ya nke ukwuu.
He is filled with spirit today.	O juru ya na mmụọ ụbọchị taa.

It is fast.	Ọ bụ ọsọ.
No one knows anything.	Ọ dịghị onye maara ihe ọ bụla.
That’s what we found.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị hụrụ.
There is no photo of him.	Enweghị foto ya.
He does just that.	Ọ na-eme nnọọ otú ahụ.
They say good land.	Ha na-ekwu ezigbo ala.
They are very familiar with the game.	Ha maara nnọọ egwuregwu ahụ.
That's what happened.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe mere ya.
And parents too.	Na nne na nna kwa.
This is bad.	Nke a dị njọ.
Children are the heart of the family.	Ụmụaka bụ obi ezinụlọ.
If you do, you will have problems.	I mee ya, ị ga-enwe nsogbu.
He needs money.	Ọ chọrọ ego.
I will not let that happen to you.	Agaghị m ekwe ka nke ahụ mee gị.

And for your dog.	Na maka nkịta gị.
People were scared.	Ụjọ tụrụ ndị mmadụ.
They cause nothing but trouble.	Ọ dịghị ihe ha kpatara ma ọ́ bụghị nsogbu.

However, my eyes fell first.	Otú ọ dị, anya m dara mbụ.

What we have is true.	Ihe anyị nwere bụ eziokwu.
Probably nothing here.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dịghị ihe dị ebe a.
Maybe he himself thought he had.	Ma eleghị anya, ya onwe ya chere na o nwere.
We are free.	Anyị nwere onwe anyị.
I feel like another child.	Ọ dị m ka nwata ọzọ.
The beautiful city is on fire.	Obodo ahụ mara mma gbara ọkụ.

She could not help herself.	O nweghị ike inyere onwe ya aka.
These are some of the most difficult questions for me.	Ndị a bụ ụfọdụ ajụjụ siri m ike.

Well, we're happy for that, of course, but somehow.	Ọ dị mma, anyị nwere obi ụtọ maka nke ahụ n'ezie, mana n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
It’s funny how these things work.	Ọ na-atọ ọchị ka ihe ndị a si arụ ọrụ.

He arrived at lunchtime.	O rutere n'oge nri ehihie.
Not what they say.	Ọ bụghị ihe ha na-ekwu.
This is scary, anyway.	Nke a bụ ihe egwu, n'ụzọ ọ bụla.
But suppose that diversity is not possible.	Ma were ya na ụdị ụdị dị iche iche agaghị ekwe omume.

She said she loved her son.	O kwuru na ya hụrụ nwa ya nwoke n’anya.
Here, here, and everywhere.	N'ebe a, ebe, na ebe niile.
Just what he wanted to tell me personally.	Naanị ihe ọ chọrọ ịgwa m n'onwe ya.
He has a good hand and a friend.	O nwere aka dị mma na enyi.
It requires several weeks of work.	Ọ na-achọ ọrụ ọtụtụ izu.
I was happy and felt great.	Obi dị m ụtọ ma nwee mmetụta dị ukwuu.
Enjoy your life with your wife and children.	Nwee obi ụtọ na ndụ gị na nwunye gị na ụmụ gị.

Nice to see you.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ gị.
It was good to play the first leg away.	Ọ dị mma ka anyị na-egwu ụkwụ nke mbụ pụọ.
The mother told her child to stop that.	Nne ahụ gwara nwa ya ka ọ kwụsị nke ahụ.

He goes for whatever he wants.	Ọ na-aga maka ihe ọ bụla ọ chọrọ.
It's not very good.	Ọ dịghị mma nke ukwuu.
He said he was sorry.	O kwuru na ọ dị nwute.
The difference.	Ihe dị iche.
These things are beyond my control.	Ihe ndị a bụ ihe karịrị ikike nke m.

Everything is in perfect place.	Ihe niile dị n'ebe zuru oke.
I really enjoyed this book.	Akwụkwọ a masịrị m nke ukwuu.
The problem is that everyone else has the same idea.	Nsogbu bụ na onye ọ bụla ọzọ nwere otu echiche.
He is an athlete.	Ọ bụ onye egwuregwu.
But if he knows.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ọ maara.
We found it useful for the money.	Anyị hụrụ na ọ bara uru maka ego ahụ.
But he still had his life.	Ma ọ ka nwere ndụ ya.
He was just a child.	Ọ bụ naanị nwata.
He went to the grocery store and bought some essentials.	Ọ gara ụlọ ahịa zụta ihe ndị dị mkpa.
The child works hard.	Nwa ahụ na-arụ ọrụ siri ike.
The roads around this place are awesome, he says.	Ụzọ ndị dị gburugburu ebe a dị egwu, ọ na-ekwu.
This is an ongoing emergency space trip.	Nke a bụ njem ohere mberede na-aga n'ihu.
We are just waiting for the event.	Anyị na-eche naanị ihe omume.
Now this can go for either man or woman.	Ugbu a nke a nwere ike ịga maka nwoke ma ọ bụ nwanyị.
The water was fast.	Mmiri ahụ siri ngwa ngwa.
So she made a report that she was pregnant.	Ya mere, o mere akụkọ na ọ dị ime.

Your mind may be in doubt.	Uche gị nwere ike inwe obi abụọ.

You will do well.	Ị ga-eme nke ọma.
I will not see my son.	Agaghị m ahụ nwa m nwoke.
They came for me.	Ha bịara maka m.

I was scared of everything.	A na m atụ egwu ihe niile.
For the three of you.	N'ihi na unu atọ.
I can not do this alone.	Enweghị m ike ime nke a naanị m.
That's how we did it.	Otú ahụ ka anyị si mee ya.
Everyone hates it.	Onye ọ bụla kpọrọ ya asị.
It's just nice.	Ọ bụ naanị mma.
Not a way of life.	Ọ bụghị ụzọ ndụ.
He is a good friend.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi.
He was so angry, he could hardly speak.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu, o siri ike ikwu okwu.

That's true.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu.

You know, not a bad idea.	Ị mara, ọ bụghị echiche ọjọọ.
This is a very beautiful place.	Nke a bụ ebe mara mma nke ukwuu.

However, this is not the case this week.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị otú ahụ n'izu a.
Our children are doing well.	Ụmụ anyị na-eme nke ọma.
Many of them are not easy to find.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ya adịghị mfe ịhụ ya.
Of course, you can't have one without the other.	N'ezie, ị gaghị enwe otu na-enweghị nke ọzọ.
There is no life story.	Enweghị akụkọ ndụ.
And you know this and see to it that it comes to work.	Na ị maara nke a wee hụ na ya na-abịa ọrụ.
They all want that.	Ha niile chọrọ nke ahụ.
There was no way around it.	O nweghị ụzọ gbara ya gburugburu.
This is a one-month period.	Nke a bụ oge otu ọnwa.
When the doctor arrived, our grandfather was awake.	Mgbe dọkịta rutere, nna nna anyị mụrụ anya.
It's a game.	Ọ bụ egwuregwu.
I like all kinds of music.	Ụdị egwu niile na-amasị m.
But we are here.	Ma, anyị nọ ebe a.
But it is why success is hard to achieve.	Ma ọ bụ ihe mere ihe ịga nke ọma siri ike nweta.
The woman was angry.	Iwe were nwanyị ahụ.
Someone is at home.	Mmadụ nọ n'ụlọ.
You have a big task ahead of you.	Ị nwere nnukwu ọrụ n'ihu gị.
It made me angry.	O were m iwe.
Maybe it's okay.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị mma.
We both want to get out.	Anyị abụọ chọrọ ịpụ.
He has an eye for that kind of thing.	O nwere anya maka ụdị ihe ahụ.
We went somewhere.	Anyị gara n'ebe ụfọdụ.
He did all he could to talk about the matter.	O mere ihe niile o nwere ike ime iji gwa ndị mmadụ gbasara okwu ahụ.
This is not a bad thing or a bad thing.	Nke a abụghị ihe ọjọọ ma ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ.
It is impossible for anyone there to do anything else.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume na onye ọ bụla n'ebe ahụ ga-eme ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
In contrast, there are examples.	N'ụzọ dị iche, enwere ihe atụ.
I'm not sure.	Adịghị m n'aka.
But no one knows much about him.	Ma ọ dịghị onye maara ọtụtụ ihe banyere ya n'akụkụ anyị.
It is because of what he does.	Ọ bụ maka ihe ọ na-eme.
Fish are everywhere.	Azụ azụ dị ebe niile.
I am here in need.	Anọ m ebe a na mkpa.
He was alone.	Ọ nọ naanị ya.
Ten minutes ago.	Nkeji iri gara aga.
We met him for an interview.	Anyị zutere ya maka ajụjụ ọnụ.
There is a lot today about this.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe dị taa gbasara nke a.
This story is one of the last.	Akụkọ a bụ otu n'ime ndị ikpeazụ.
Now, hurry up!	Ugbu a, mee ọsọ ọsọ!
At the same time on the machine, and then two people are different.	N'otu oge na igwe, na mgbe ahụ mmadụ abụọ dị iche iche.
He went on his way.	Ọ gara n'ụzọ.
We can do nothing else to help.	Anyị enweghị ike ime ihe ọzọ iji nyere aka.
Let me know if you are interested.	Mee ka m mara ma ọ bụrụ na ị nwere mmasị.
I need it for a reason.	Achọrọ m ya maka ihe kpatara ya.
It works because we said it works.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ n'ihi na anyị kwuru na ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
I left him running at night.	M hapụrụ ya na-agba ọsọ n'abalị.
There is nothing for the day behind us.	Ọ dịghị ihe maka ụbọchị n'azụ anyị.
Everyone does this differently.	Onye ọ bụla na-eme nke a n'ụzọ dị iche.
Cars and cars crashed.	Ụgbọ ala na ụgbọ ala dara.
They are just like everyone else.	Ha dị ka onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
The two run each other into the ground.	Otu abụọ na-agba ọsọ onwe ha n'ime ala.
On the one hand	N'otu aka ahụ
He can do this.	O nwere ike ime nke a.
It is the feeling of this.	Ọ bụ mmetụta nke a.
In this case, not really.	Na nke a, ọ bụghị n'ezie.
Next thing they need to do.	Ihe ọzọ ha kwesịrị ime.
They don’t have it but a woman in the store suggested this.	Ha enweghị ya mana nwanyị nọ n'ụlọ ahịa ahụ tụrụ aro nke a.
We are planning a family trip.	Anyị na-eme atụmatụ njem ezinụlọ.
You are not me.	Ị bụghị m.
Can anyone please help me as soon as possible.	Enwere ike onye ọ bụla biko nyere m aka ozugbo enwere ike.
I can get paid for it.	Enwere m ike nweta ụgwọ maka ya.
It is unique.	Ọ bụ ihe pụrụ iche.
Such a person.	Onye dị otú ahụ.
The plant received a lot of water.	Osisi ahụ nwetara oke mmiri.
He is full of fear.	Ụjọ juru ya n’afọ.
It's something I enjoy.	Ọ bụ ihe na-atọ m ụtọ.
I have something in my eye.	Enwere m ihe n'anya m.
He is still in a coma.	Ọ ka nọ na mberede.
His question was logical.	Ajụjụ ya nwere ezi uche.
Running new models.	Na-agba ụdị ọhụrụ.
But he was ready for me.	Ma ọ dị njikere maka m.
The new one is doing something like this right now.	Nke ọhụrụ na-eme ihe dị otú a ugbu a.
There is more than physical.	E nwere ihe karịrị nke anụ ahụ.
You are stronger than you know.	Ị dị ike karịa ka ị maara.
It was the first day of summer.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị mbụ nke okpomọkụ.
In some countries, people speak more than one language.	Ná mba ụfọdụ, ndị mmadụ na-asụ ihe karịrị otu asụsụ.
I did it.	M mere ya.
This song is the theme song of this movie.	Egwu a bụ egwu egwu ihe nkiri a.
What matters is when it happens.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ mgbe ọ mere.
The people saw him and left.	Ndị mmadụ hụrụ ya wee pụọ n'akụkụ.
There were a few fires.	Ọkụ dị ole na ole gbara ọkụ.
Please make yourself at home.	Biko mee onwe gị n'ụlọ.
All those sufferings.	Ahụhụ ndị ahụ niile.
He has tremendous authority.	O nwere ikike dị ukwuu.
Then they came quickly and forcefully.	Mgbe ahụ, ha bịara ngwa ngwa na ike.
Or it may not be at all.	Ma ọ bụ o nwere ike ọ gaghị eme ma ọlị.
User with name.	Onye ọrụ nwere aha.
You just want people to see it.	Naanị ị chọrọ ka ndị mmadụ hụ ya.
I do not know where to go now.	Amaghị m ebe m ga-aga ugbu a.
Not sure if many other things.	Ejighị n'aka ma ọ bụrụ ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ.
The situation is still very serious.	Ọnọdụ ahụ ka dị oke njọ.
We started over the years.	Anyị malitere n'ime ọtụtụ afọ.
Nothing serious.	Ọ dịghị mkpa.
There is not enough paper in the house.	Enweghị akwụkwọ zuru oke n'ụlọ ahụ.
Other things.	Ihe ndị ọzọ.
This causes them a great deal of trouble.	Nke a na-eme ha nnukwu nsogbu.
It seems to be something that everyone is interested in.	O yiri ka ọ bụ ihe onye ọ bụla nwere mmasị na ya.
Many years ago, we went to a party.	Ọtụtụ afọ gara aga, anyị gara oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
Cannot be used for anything.	Enweghị ike iji ya mee ihe ọ bụla.
See how many questions you get successfully.	Hụ ajụjụ ole ị nwetara nke ọma.
Lots of people.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ.
Everyone loves it.	Onye ọ bụla hụrụ ya n'anya.
I know everything.	Amaara m ihe niile.
I ran fast.	M gbara ọsọ ọsọ.
You are the father of everyone.	Ị bụ nna onye ọ bụla.
I do not know how they will do that.	Amaghị m otú ha ga-esi mee nke ahụ.
Everything is there.	Ihe niile dị n'ebe.
Only your words are important.	Naanị okwu gị dị mkpa.
Everything stopped for him.	Ihe niile kwụsịrị maka ya.
Because it is difficult.	N'ihi na ọ siri ike.
Now they do everything together.	Ugbu a, ha na-eme ihe niile ọnụ.
Not as we did.	Ọ bụghị dị ka anyị mere.
No, just the point.	Mba, naanị isi.
So it is with their lives.	Otú ahụ ka ndụ ha dị.
It has a difference.	Ọ nwere iche.
Microphone.	Igwe okwu.
Works double.	Na-arụ ọrụ abụọ.
But we know who knows.	Ma anyị maara onye maara.
He bought a sleeping bag for the trip.	Ọ zụtara akpa ụra maka ụzọ ahụ.
There was nothing that he could do.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ pụrụ ime.
He loved it.	Ọ hụrụ n'anya.
The doctor should be consulted.	Ekwesịrị ịgwa dọkịta ahụ.
My mom has a really nice friend in this one.	Nne m nwere enyi nke mara ezigbo mma na nke a.
He gave me everything.	O nyere m ihe niile.
I don’t think we expected it to be bad.	Echeghị m na anyị tụrụ anya na ọ ga-adị njọ.
She wants men.	Ọ chọrọ ụmụ nwoke.
It is not your circumstances that make you unhappy.	Ọ bụghị ọnọdụ gị na-eme ka ị ghara inwe obi ụtọ.
But she misses home.	Ma ọ na-atụ uche ụlọ.
They do not know where they live.	Ha amaghị ebe ha bi.
I think a lot of people should be like that, really.	Echere m na ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ kwesịrị ịdị otu ahụ, n'ezie.
He asked me to water the trees.	Ọ gwara m ka m nye osisi ndị ahụ mmiri.
It seems absurd.	Ọ dị ka ihe na-enweghị uche.
As his character says.	Dị ka agwa ya.
A beautiful movie like the first movie.	Ihe nkiri mara mma dị ka ihe nkiri mbụ.
It is the third act.	Ọ bụ omume nke atọ.
Students come from all over to come to his study.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ si n'ebe niile bịa ka ha bịa ọmụmụ ihe ya.
This is the way it should be.	Nke a bụ otu o kwesịrị ịdị.
This law requires authorization.	Iwu a chọrọ inye ikike.
Not a big deal, for me.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu ihe, nye m.
This is where you live.	Nke a bụ ebe i bi.
The court sentenced him to two years in prison for hard labor.	Ụlọ ikpe mara ya ikpe afọ abụọ n'ọrụ siri ike.
There is no work to be done in this city.	O nweghị ọrụ ọ bụla ịnọ na obodo a.
Not the photos here.	Ọ bụghị foto ndị ahụ dị ebe a.
They both nodded.	Ha abụọ gbara isi.
That's the way to go.	Nke ahụ bụ ụzọ isi.
I don't know if he will do it.	Amaghị m ma ọ ga-eme ya.
He wanted to get a third.	Ọ chọrọ wee nweta nke atọ.
Maybe they think.	Ma eleghị anya, ha na-eche.
This is huge.	Nke a bụ nnukwu.
I need to call it.	Ekwesịrị m ịkpọ ya.
You only get one.	Ị nweta naanị otu.
We need it on this trip.	Anyị chọrọ ya na njem a.
But it looks like one.	Ma ọ dị ka otu.
At your workplace.	N'ebe ọrụ gị.
I was surprised.	O juru m anya.
They will act quickly if they want something new.	Ha ga-eme ngwa ngwa ma ọ bụrụ na ha chọrọ ihe ọhụrụ.
Of course everyone got a little bit.	N'ezie na onye ọ bụla nwetara ntakịrị.
This restaurant has a fantastic look.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ a nwere anya dị egwu.
The good news, however, is that it is irrelevant.	Otú ọ dị, ozi ọma ahụ bụ na ọ dịghị mkpa.
I was born there, in the bedroom, waiting.	A mụrụ m n'ebe ahụ, n'ime ime ụlọ, chere.
Of course they are not.	N'ezie ha abụghị.
I want more, by the way.	Achọrọ m karịa, n'agbanyeghị.
The letters are null and void.	Akwụkwọ ozi ndị ahụ enweghị isi.
On his part.	Na nke ya.
They are not like that.	Ha abụghị ụdị ihe ahụ.
They gave it to him.	Ha nyere ya ya.
We do only within.	Anyị na-eme naanị n'ime.
A lot of my money goes to food.	Ọtụtụ ego m na-aga nri.
We have everything we need here.	Anyị nwere ihe niile anyị chọrọ ebe a.
But she is often nervous.	Ma ụjọ na-atụ ya ọtụtụ mgbe.
It went well.	Ọ gara nke ọma.
I loved the idea.	Ahụrụ m echiche ahụ n'anya.
It looks like it has no skin.	Ọ dị ka o nweghị akpụkpọ ahụ.
The ground cannot be seen.	Enweghị ike ịhụ ala ahụ.
Very well.	Ọ dị mma nke ukwuu.
He went to a bar to make himself a drink.	Ọ gara n'ụlọ mmanya iji mee onwe ya ihe ọṅụṅụ.
Maybe you will.	Ma eleghị anya, ị ga-eme ya.
This will not work the other way around.	Nke a agaghị arụ ọrụ n'ụzọ ọzọ.
This city is known for its many fine restaurants.	A maara obodo a maka ọtụtụ ụlọ nri mara mma.
Work and life should be different.	Ọrụ na ndụ kwesịrị ịdị iche.
He stopped behind her.	Ọ kwụsịrị n'azụ ya.
I can't believe it's bad.	Enweghị m ike ikweta na ọ dị njọ.
We have two girls.	Anyị nwere ụmụ agbọghọ abụọ.
He made it clear that this plan was impossible.	O mere ka a mara na atụmatụ a agaghị ekwe omume.
He probably did not know me.	O nwere ike ịbụ na ọ maghị m.
It's very nice, he said.	Ọ mara ezigbo mma, o kwuru.
Not that you can't talk.	Ọ bụghị na ị nweghị ike ikwu okwu.
A few bad months, a few good ones.	Ọnwa ole na ole ọjọọ, ole na ole dị mma.
But police officer, he's beautiful.	Ma onye uwe ojii, ọ mara mma.
One time he was there.	Otu oge ọ nọ ebe ahụ.
That makes it easy for us to eat meat.	Nke ahụ na-eme ka anyị dị mfe anụ oriri.
We want this to go around.	Anyị chọrọ ka nke a na-aga gburugburu.
You do this.	Ị na-eme nke a.
I think you saw the first one.	Echere m na ị hụrụ nke mbụ.
Some are good, some are not.	Ụfọdụ dị mma, ụfọdụ adịghị otú ahụ.
We have an important task ahead of us.	Anyị nwere ọrụ dị mkpa n'ihu anyị.
He saw things.	Ọ hụrụ ihe.
He put his hand on his heart.	O tinyere aka ya n’obi ya.
But this anyway.	Ma nke a n'agbanyeghị.
Truth is not the way you want it to be.	Eziokwu abụghị otú ị chọrọ ka ọ dị.
Both will cook.	Ha abụọ ga-esi nri.
This cannot be true.	Nke a enweghị ike ịbụ eziokwu.
It’s all of these, but a lot more.	Ọ bụ ndị a niile, mana ọtụtụ ihe ndị ọzọ.
This is my opportunity.	Nke a bụ ohere m.
It's a pleasure.	Ọ bụ ihe ụtọ.
Lots of new people.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọhụrụ.
You think a lot.	Ị na-eche nke ukwuu.
Still, I like that she is trying to keep me calm.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ na-atọ m ụtọ na ọ na-agbalị ime ka ahụ́ ruo m ala.
I think I was alone.	Echere m na ọ bụ naanị m.
He stopped at the last one.	Ọ kwụsịrị na nke ikpeazụ.
This trend continues in some ways.	Ebe a na-aga n'ihu n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
I can speak.	Enwere m ike ikwu okwu.
Keep up the good work.	Na-aga n'ihu na ọrụ ọma ahụ.
His condition is critical.	Ọnọdụ ya dị egwu.
She is happy.	Obi dị ya mma.
It was a scary family.	Ọ bụ ezinụlọ na-atụ ụjọ.
He spoke well of his country.	O kwuru nke ọma banyere obodo ya.
You just need a good teacher.	Naanị ị chọrọ ezigbo onye nkuzi.
He is a strong man.	Ọ bụ onye siri ike.
Nothing special about it.	Ọ dịghị ihe pụrụ iche banyere ya.
If he went anywhere.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ gara ebe ọ bụla.
They both love each other.	Ha abụọ hụrụ n'anya.
He never told her the truth about what had happened.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ gwara ya eziokwu nke ihe merenụ.
First, you need to know how to get there.	Nke mbụ, i kwesịrị ịma ụzọ ị ga-esi ruo ebe ahụ.
This car is brand new.	Ụgbọ ala a dị ọhụrụ.
This is a great interview.	Nke a bụ nnukwu ajụjụ ọnụ.
He has no real friends.	O nweghị ezigbo enyi.
And of course two more.	Na n'ezie abụọ ndị ọzọ.
Because it is true.	N'ihi na ọ bụ eziokwu.
So he said.	Ya mere o kwuru.
Speaking, as my father told me, is easier said than done.	Ikwu okwu, dị ka nna m gwara m, dị mfe ikwu karịa ikwu okwu.
They said the tests were pointless.	Ha kwuru na ule ndị ahụ enweghị isi.
I think it's really stupid.	Echere m na ọ bụ nzuzu n'ezie.
Everyone was angry.	Onye ọ bụla were ya iwe.
I think it is not.	Echere m na ọ bụ na ọ bụghị.
Not to do it.	Ọ bụghị ime ya.
Which is nonsense now that he cares about it.	Nke na-enweghị isi ugbu a na ọ na-eche banyere ya.
She has a serious stomach problem.	O nwere nsogbu afọ siri ike.
I'm telling the truth about it.	M na-ekwu eziokwu banyere ya.
The bed was burned.	Akwa akwa ahụ gbara ọkụ.
Family is not the only thing that matters.	Ezinụlọ abụghị naanị ihe dị mkpa.
They liked it.	Ọ masịrị ha.
We like business.	Ọrụ ego na-amasị anyị.
Most of their work is awesome.	Ọtụtụ ọrụ ha bụ egwu.
It is the body of a dead person.	Ọ bụ ahụ́ onye nwụrụ anwụ.
I can still love them as a family.	M ka nwere ike ịhụ ha n'anya dị ka ezinụlọ.
So much, so much.	Ọ dị ukwuu, nke ukwuu.
This is the best time of the year.	Nke a bụ oge kacha mma n'afọ.
You made it better.	I mere ya ka mma.
The room was very hot.	Ime ụlọ ahụ merenụ dị ọkụ nke ukwuu.
Now we are good friends.	Ugbu a, anyị bụ ezigbo enyi.
The message will be to go.	Ozi ahụ ga-abụ ịga.
I was busy working our way.	M ji ọrụ n'aka na-arụ ọrụ n'ụzọ anyị.
This is a long question.	Nke a bụ ajụjụ dị ogologo.
It may have been on the phone.	O nwere ike ịbụ na ekwentị ọ kpọrọ ya.
We may not think about it, but we do.	Anyị nwere ike ghara iche banyere ya, ma anyị na-eme ya.
It could happen to my grandchildren.	O nwere ike ime ụmụ ụmụ m.
However, this was not a bad idea.	Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị echiche ọjọọ o mere.
People are jokes.	Ndị mmadụ bụ ihe egwuregwu.
They only do.	Ha na-eme naanị.
Apparently he is still interested in it.	O doro anya na ọ ka nwere mmasị na ya.
There are ongoing reports.	Enwere akụkọ na-aga n'ihu.
These are mine.	Ndị a bụ nke m.
The doctor left.	Dọkịta ahụ pụrụ.
This is a better job.	Nke a ka mma ọrụ.
That would be this.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ a.
I love this book.	Ahụrụ m akwụkwọ a n'anya.
I wouldn’t say ‘maybe’.	Agaghị m asị 'ma eleghị anya'.
Not often but sometimes.	Ọ bụghị mgbe mgbe ma mgbe ụfọdụ.
You know that this is not good.	Ị ma na nke a adịghị mma.
This is not an easy task.	Nke a abụghị ọrụ dị mfe.
Now on to the car.	Ugbu a na ụgbọ ala.
Only a few people came today.	Naanị mmadụ ole na ole bịara taa.
Probably few know about it.	Ma eleghị anya, ole na ole maara banyere ya.
He has many friends.	O nwere ọtụtụ ndị enyi.
She is her husband.	Ọ bụ di ya.
There is a good chance it is a lie.	Enwere ezigbo ohere na ọ bụ ụgha.
Now, let’s assume that only the heart is important.	Ugbu a, ka anyị were ya na ọ bụ naanị obi dị mkpa.
He is going to the hospital now.	Ọ na-aga ụlọ ọgwụ ugbu a.
His hand is strong.	Aka ya siri ike.
His father met him at the port, dressed in a suit.	Nna ya zutere ya na ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri, yi uwe akwa.
This is really bad.	Nke a dị njọ n'ezie.
Back again and again.	Azụ ugboro ugboro ugboro ugboro.
It's delicious.	Ọ dị ụtọ.
The song is sweet and makes it feel unattractive.	Abụ ahụ na-atọ ụtọ ma mee ka ọ nwee mmetụta nke enweghị mmasị.
Hear and you can.	Nụrụ ma ị nwere ike.
It is this.	Ọ bụ nke a.
He spoke to them.	Ọ gwara ha okwu n'aka nke ya.
In different places known as different names.	N'ebe dị iche iche a maara dị ka aha dị iche iche.
The dead are alive.	Ndị nwụrụ anwụ dị ndụ.
You are scared.	Ị tụrụ egwu.
I was there.	Anọ m ebe ahụ.
I have no problems at school.	Anaghị m enwe ihe isi ike n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
I need a small hand.	Achọrọ m obere aka.
Sometimes people are expensive.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ndị dị ọnụ.
Still, many feel that they are extremely cruel.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọtụtụ na-eche na ha dị oke obi ọjọọ.
He left her there.	Ọ hapụrụ ya ebe ahụ.
There will be more important literature there.	A ga-enwe akwụkwọ dị mkpa karịa ebe ahụ.
Of course not.	N'ezie, ha emeghị.
All I need is ten.	Naanị ihe m chọrọ bụ iri.
He gave me another gift.	O nyere m onyinye ọzọ.
Talk to him several times.	Gwa ya okwu ọtụtụ ugboro.
That will be your responsibility.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ọrụ gị.
Both of us.	Anyị abụọ.
Everyone should play it well.	Onye ọ bụla kwesịrị igwu ya nke ọma.
I would not know.	Agaghị m ama.
There is no living thing.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị ndụ.
He was just a happy man.	Ọ bụ naanị nwoke nwere obi ụtọ.
They did not appreciate it.	Ha ejighị ya kpọrọ ihe.
I do not like sleep.	Anaghị m enwe mmasị ụra.
But there is no chance that will happen to me.	Mana o nweghị ohere nke ahụ ga-eme m.
Second, this is not a special case.	Ihe nke abụọ bụ na nke a abụghị ikpe pụrụ iche.
Not sure if that would have been possible.	Ejighị n'aka na nke ahụ gaara ekwe omume.
The country is in crisis.	Mba ahụ nọ n'ihe isi ike.
But he had much to say.	Ma e nwere ọtụtụ ihe ọ chọrọ ikwu.
Only new customers.	Naanị ndị ahịa ọhụrụ.
But you may wonder if there is anything else.	Ma, ị nwere ike iche ma ọ dị ihe ọzọ.
None of these things were done.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a e mere.
That’s what you do well.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ị na-eme nke ọma.
I always have.	Enwere m mgbe niile.
It’s instantly delicious and delicious.	Ọ dị ụtọ ozugbo ma na-atọ ụtọ.
I waited for a while.	Echere m nwa oge.
This made it available to others.	Nke a mere ka ọ dị adị nye anyị ndị ọzọ.
At this time now.	N'oge a ugbu a.
But her condition is serious.	Ma ọnọdụ ya dị njọ.
He has a wife.	Ọ nwere nwunye.
Sleep is a big one of those.	Ụra bụ nnukwu otu n'ime ndị ahụ.
What lives there is itself.	Ihe bi n'ebe ahụ bụ onwe ya.
Not until his dog stopped.	Ọ bụghị ruo mgbe nkịta ya kwụsịrị.
Because we have nothing without it.	N'ihi na anyị enweghị ihe ọ bụla na-enweghị ya.
My brother has a beautiful wife and two beautiful children.	Nwanne m nwoke nwere nwunye mara mma na ụmụ abụọ mara mma.
None of it seems to exist.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ya yiri ka ọ dị adị.
You can not see it.	Ị nweghị ike ịhụ ya.
You speak well and well.	Ị na-ekwu nke ọma na nke ọma.

But it was the law of the land at that time.	Mana ọ bụ iwu obodo n'oge ahụ.
Weekends are a happy time.	Oge izu ụka bụ oge obi ụtọ.
But no baby.	Ma ọ dịghị nwa.
We both understand other things.	Anyị abụọ ghọtara ihe ndị ọzọ.
Of course we are.	N'ezie anyị bụ.
He was completely convinced.	O zuru anya n'aka.
But it is definitely time to move on.	Mana ọ bụ n'ezie oge ịga n'ihu.
I don't care.	Achọghị m ịma.
It could be here.	O nwere ike ịbụ ebe a.
He is my best friend.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi m.
It's just like.	Ọ dị nnọọ ka .
That would be really bad.	Nke ahụ ga-adị njọ n'ezie.
It is lack of sleep.	Ọ bụ enweghị ụra.
Despite his age, he was young, of course.	N'agbanyeghị afọ ndụ ya, ọ bụ nwata, n'ezie.
That is all.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe niile.
He left the building immediately.	Ọ hapụrụ ụlọ ahụ ngwa ngwa.
We are beautiful.	Anyị mara mma.
Whatever the reason, no one is wise.	N'agbanyeghị ihe kpatara ya, ọ dịghị onye nwere uche.

You have to be ready for both.	Ị ga-adị njikere maka ha abụọ.
It is very different from everyone else.	Ọ dị nnọọ iche na onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
If it is really easy, everyone will do it.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mfe n'ezie, onye ọ bụla ga-eme ya.
The boy's father died ten years ago.	Nna nwata ahụ nwụrụ afọ iri gara aga.
They have some time.	Ha nwere oge ụfọdụ.
They are not made for the sake of their usefulness.	A naghị eme ha maka uru bara uru ha bara.
That game is what it is.	Na egwuregwu bụ ihe ọ bụ.
He does not hear the main sound.	Ọ naghị anụ isi ihe egwu.
He wants what he wants.	Ọ chọrọ ihe ọ chọrọ.
There are many beautiful books that will interest every reader.	Enwere ọtụtụ akwụkwọ mara mma ga-amasị onye ọ bụla na-agụ ya.
Just tell me to stop.	Naanị gwa m ka m kwụsị.

But that must be done quickly.	Ma nke ahụ kwesịrị ime ngwa ngwa.
It looks like, you have to go.	Ọ dị ka, ị ga-aga.
If they don't want my money, they won't have it.	Ọ bụrụ na ha achọghị ego m, ha agaghị enwe ya.
Every day is different.	Ụbọchị ọ bụla dị iche.
The policeman wanted to know why he was reading them.	Onye uwe ojii ahụ chọrọ ịma ihe mere o ji na-agụ ha.
Well, good thing he's here.	Ọ dị mma, ihe dị mma na ọ nọ ebe a.
Every child belongs to us.	Nwa ọ bụla bụ nke anyị.

You do what you are told.	Ị na-eme ihe a gwara gị.
Lots of emotions.	Ọtụtụ mmetụta uche.

He put it into his heart.	O tinyere aka n'obi ya.
This can be done for a number of reasons.	Enwere ike ime nke a maka ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
I am not a bad man.	Abụghị m nwoke ọjọọ.
The service was friendly and the food was good.	Ọrụ ahụ dị enyi na nri dị mma.
He is the fire, and those lights are his.	Ọ bụ ya bụ ọkụ, na ọkụ ndị ahụ bụ ya.
There is little he can do about it.	O nwere obere ihe o nwere ike ime banyere nke a.
That is not true.	Nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
No one said.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru.

It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
Nothing worse could happen.	Ọ dịghị ihe ka njọ nwere ike ime.
Of course, it is different.	N'ezie, ọ dị iche.

It was a short time ago.	Ọ bụ obere oge gara aga.
There is a running car.	Enwere ụgbọ ala na-agba ọsọ.
This method works today.	Ụzọ a na-arụ ọrụ taa.
None of us expected to play.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị tụrụ anya igwu egwu.
It's like.	Ọ dị ka .
But there is a way out.	Ma e nwere ụzọ isi pụọ.
In this case, however, there is really nothing we can do.	Otú ọ dị, na nke a, ọ dịghị ihe anyị pụrụ ime n'ezie.
Something beautiful, something beautiful.	Ihe mara mma, ihe mara mma.
They do not go on.	Ha adịghị aga n'ihu.
I can do this with my partner.	Enwere m ike ime nke a na ibe m.
There are no rules.	Enweghị iwu.
But one thing is for sure.	Mana otu ihe ka doro anya.
That should be the case.	Otú ahụ ka o kwesịrị ịdị.
It comes and goes through everyone without words.	Ọ na-abịa na-aga site na onye ọ bụla na-enweghị okwu.
Small amounts of money go a long way.	Obere ego na-aga n'ụzọ dị anya.
This will continue for months.	Nke a ga-aga n'ihu ruo ọnwa.
My family did not like it.	Ezinụlọ m ahụghị ya n'anya.
Now, here is the first photo.	Ugbu a, ebe a bụ foto mbụ.
It seems that other services do not work as well.	Ọ dị ka ọrụ ndị ọzọ anaghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
He wanted to be a teacher one day.	Ọ chọrọ ịbụ onye nkuzi otu ụbọchị.
But the reason for this is obvious.	Ma ihe kpatara nke a doro anya.
So here they are again.	Ya mere, ebe a ka ha nọ ọzọ.

I want it to feel good.	Achọrọ m ka ọ dị m ka ọ dị mma.
Make no.	Mee ka ọ dịghị.
It tastes really good.	Ọ bụ ezigbo isi ụtọ.
We are all one family.	Anyị niile bụ otu ezinụlọ.
That is why only the first one works.	Ọ bụ ya mere naanị nke mbụ na-arụ ọrụ.
These people can do whatever they want.	Ndị a nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla ha chọrọ.
He tried to see.	Ọ gbalịrị ịhụ.
But there may be a lot of my stories out there.	Mana enwere ike inwe ọtụtụ akụkọ m ebe ahụ.
I'm just looking for the truth.	Naanị m na-achọ eziokwu.
We are talking about her life as a mother.	Anyị na-ekwu banyere ndụ ya dị ka nne.
That was a few months ago.	Nke ahụ bụ ọnwa ole na ole gara aga.
Would you like to.	Ọ ga-amasị gị.
Along the way they took a short break.	N'ụzọ ha were obere ezumike.
He said he had no money.	O kwuru na ya enweghị ego.
I have some of his books.	Enwere m ụfọdụ akwụkwọ ya.
You know my wife.	Ị maara nwunye m.
He realized who he was.	Ọ ghọtara na ọ bụ onye ọ bụ.
This morning, however, was a different experience.	Otú ọ dị, ụtụtụ a bụ ihe dị nnọọ iche.
Suddenly he had his own idea.	Na mberede o nwere echiche nke ya.
He knocked on the door.	Ọ tụrụ aka n'ọnụ ụzọ.
I can get out.	Enwere m ike ịpụ.
It seemed so obvious all of a sudden.	Ọ dị ka ihe doro anya na mberede.
But they are not children, any of these.	Ma ha abụghị ụmụaka, nke ọ bụla n'ime ndị a.
I think most doctors do not see their patients.	Echere m na ọtụtụ ndị dọkịta anaghị ahụ ndị ọrịa ha.
But it does not happen.	Ma ọ naghị eme.
She never told him.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ gwara ya.
Stop being cruel.	Kwụsị ime ka onye obi ọjọọ.
They are one.	Ha bụ otu.
The temperature is not too high.	Ọnọdụ okpomọkụ adịghị oke.
There is no one else to help you.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ ga-enyere gị aka.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
Take my word for it, he is wise.	Were okwu m maka ya, ọ mara ihe.
I really enjoyed the work.	Ọrụ ahụ na-atọ m ụtọ nke ukwuu.
He stopped as soon as he entered the room.	Ọ kwụsịrị ozugbo ọ banyere n'ime ụlọ.
He has dead eyes.	O nwere anya nwụrụ anwụ.
They are important in his planning.	Ha dị mkpa na atụmatụ ya.
Dogs eat dogs, they say.	Nkịta na-eri nkịta, ka ha na-ekwu.
This is done by other users.	Nke a na-eme site n'aka ndị ọrụ ndị ọzọ.
I think it looks beautiful.	Echere m na ọ mara mma n'anya.
The wife feels that way.	Nwunye ahụ lere okwu ahụ anya otú ahụ.
Now he thinks.	Ugbu a, ọ chere.
In two dogs.	Na nkịta abụọ.
The generator is on fire.	Igwe ọkụ ahụ gbara ọkụ.
But this is happening.	Mana nke a na-eme.
We left our lunch at the store.	Anyị hapụrụ nri nri ehihie anyị n'ụlọ ahịa.
Like me so much.	Dị ka m nke ukwuu.
Maybe it’s as simple as that.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị mfe dị ka nke ahụ.
He hoped to succeed.	Ọ tụrụ anya na ọ ga-aga nke ọma.
It is not our job.	Ọ bụghị ọrụ anyị.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
Her father was wondering if her son was interested in school.	Nna ya nọ na-eche ma nwa ya nwoke nwere mmasị na ụlọ akwụkwọ.
That's fine.	Nke ahụ dị mma.
This is one of them.	Nke a bụ otu n'ime ha.
That is what we should be talking about.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị kwesịrị ịdị na-ekwu maka ya.
This car is very expensive.	Ụgbọ ala a dị oke ọnụ.
They left and took action.	Ha pụọ ​​wee mee ihe.
But eat now.	Ma rie ugbu a.
He had a wife and children.	O nwere nwunye na ụmụaka.
He said something very important.	O kwuru ihe dị ezigbo mkpa.
It’s awesome, awesome.	Ọ dị egwu, dị egwu.
He just wants us to see and get the best out of it.	Ọ chọrọ naanị ka anyị hụ ma nweta ihe kacha mma.
Sports or not, they can be fun.	Egwuregwu ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị, ha nwere ike na-atọ ụtọ.
He knew that only he could do it.	Ọ maara na naanị ya nwere ike ime ya.
The sooner the company started, the better the job.	Ozugbo ụlọ ọrụ ahụ malitere, ọrụ ka mma.
Of course, there should be more than that.	N'ezie, ekwesịrị inwe ọtụtụ ihe karịa mgbe ahụ.
Great week for the company.	Nnukwu izu maka ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
Try until you have it.	Na-agbalị ruo mgbe ị nwere ya.
The head is not healthy.	Isi adịghị mma.
Now he runs after them.	Ugbu a ọ na-agba ha ọsọ.
Two, because that is very good.	Abụọ, n'ihi na nke ahụ dị ezigbo mma.
I will be looking for a place to stay tonight.	Aga m achọ ebe m ga-anọ n'abalị a.
You know it's time for a newcomer.	Ọ bụ na ị maara na ọ bụ oge maka onye ọhụrụ.
He said he came this way by himself.	O kwuru na ya bịara n'ụzọ a n'onwe ya.
But it does not have to be.	Ma ọ dịghị mkpa ka ọ bụrụ.
It makes all the people around it better.	Ọ na-eme ka ndị niile gbara ya gburugburu ka mma.
It was packed.	O juru n'ọnụ.
There is a good reason for the law.	Enwere ezi ihe kpatara iwu ahụ.
The man was very happy that night.	Nwoke ahụ nwere ezigbo obi ụtọ n'abalị ahụ.
No, we can not do that.	Mba, anyị enweghị ike ime nke ahụ.
That is a simple story.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ dị mfe.
Meanwhile, it is liked by a few women.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, ọ na-amasị ụmụ nwanyị ole na ole.
They are both children.	Ha abụọ bụ naanị ụmụaka.
But this is what is really here.	Ma nke a bụ ihe dị n'ezie ebe a.
He will do it.	Ọ ga-eme ya.
This question is about literature.	Ajụjụ a gbasara akwụkwọ.
The head of the car is key in that situation.	Onye isi ụgbọ ala bụ isi na ọnọdụ ahụ.
Now he realizes it is the other way around.	Ugbu a, ọ ghọtara na ọ bụ n'ụzọ ọzọ.
But in terms of emotion, it really is.	Ma n'ihe gbasara mmetụta, ọ bụ n'ezie.
But, you know, that's fine.	Mana, ị maara, ọ dị mma.
Now it seems out of place.	Ugbu a ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ebe ahụ.
That is unique.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe pụrụ iche.
He just wanted a break from everything.	Ọ chọrọ naanị oge ezumike n'ihe niile.
These things sometimes happen but never do.	Ihe ndị a na-eme mgbe ụfọdụ ma ọ naghị eme.
It could be any church in the country.	O nwere ike ịbụ ụka ọ bụla dị na mba ahụ.
In fact, he is still doing it.	N'ezie, ọ ka na-eme ya.
She died three years ago.	Ọ nwụrụ afọ atọ gara aga.
The city is next to his house, not there in the first place.	Obodo dị n'akụkụ ụlọ ya, ọ bụghị ebe ahụ na mbụ.
I love words, they really make my day !.	Ahụrụ m okwu n'anya, ha na-eme ụbọchị m n'ezie!.
Nothing like it.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị ka ọ dị.
I feel guilty.	Obi na-ama m ikpe.
He doesn’t like the environment.	O nweghị mmasị na gburugburu ya.
They have the best information on your case.	Ha nwere ozi kacha mma na ikpe gị.
Its price is nothing.	Ọnụ ego ya enweghị ihe ọ bụla.
Of course we looked.	N'ezie, anyị lere anya.
They are known for that.	A maara ha maka nke ahụ.
That's about to say it all.	Nke ahụ banyere na-ekwu ya niile.
The police will help us talk.	Ndị uwe ojii ga-enyere anyị aka ikwu.
Not anything.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọ bụla.
Of course, he was a big kid !.	N'ezie, ọ bụ nnukwu nwa!.
This may be the funniest movie of the year.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ ihe nkiri kacha atọ ọchị nke afọ.
He has a problem, that.	O nwere nsogbu, nke ahụ.
You have big eyes and small ones.	Ị nwere nnukwu anya na nke ya dị obere.
Last month, but nothing.	N'ọnwa gara aga, ma ihe ọ bụla.
Is the water cold?	Mmiri ahụ ọ dị oyi?
Therefore, this diet will be essential.	Ya mere, ihe oriri a ga-adị mkpa.
Tears welled up in my eyes as he spoke.	Anya mmiri gbara m ihu ka ọ na-ekwu.
You can say what you say, but you are what you are.	Ị nwere ike ikwu ihe ị na-ekwu, ma ị bụ ihe ị bụ.
Their power is limited.	Ike ha nwere oke.
Very nice for tonight.	Dị nnọọ mma maka abalị a.
Only one case.	Naanị otu ikpe.
Sometimes life gets better.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ndụ na-ama mma.
This is what people say.	Nke a bụ ihe ndị mmadụ na-ekwu.
It doesn't look good.	Ọ naghị adị ka ihe dị mma.
It is funny sometimes because they do different things there.	Ọ na-atọ ọchị mgbe ụfọdụ n'ihi na ha na-eme ihe dị iche iche n'ebe ahụ.
Hard place.	Ebe siri ike.
The event goes around it.	Ihe omume na-aga gburugburu ya.
You only need a little.	Ị chọrọ naanị ntakịrị.
It was a great summer for a happy day.	Ọ bụ ezigbo okpomọkụ maka ụbọchị obi ụtọ.
This beautiful city needs a good tour.	Obodo a mara mma chọrọ njem nke ọma.
Variety is good.	Ụdị dị iche iche dị mma.
I don’t train anyone else.	Anaghị m azụ onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
We would be happy to talk to you.	Obi ga-adị anyị ụtọ ịgwa gị okwu.
It’s a great room clock for you or your child.	Ọ bụ ezigbo elekere ime ụlọ maka gị ma ọ bụ nwa gị.
But they are good.	Ma ha dị mma.
It is well-known in our country.	A ma ama ama ama ama na mba anyị niile.
The plan is not good on my side.	Atụmatụ adịghị mma n'akụkụ m.
Every day is a battle.	Ụbọchị ọ bụla bụ ọgụ.
That is why we need you.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị ji chọọ gị.
His eyes were full of tears.	Anya kpọrọ ya asị.
They seem to like it.	O yiri ka ha masịrị ya.
Everything is fine with work.	Ihe niile dị mma na ọrụ.
But here we are.	Ma, ebe a anyị nọ.
He understood, of course.	Ọ ghọtara, n'ezie.
Money is not an issue.	Ego abụghị okwu.
The city is important.	Obodo dị mkpa n'ụzọ dị mkpa.
And he went out from there.	O wee pụọ ebe ahụ.
Sit in the car.	Nọdụ na ụgbọala.
Employees should know these two basics.	Ndị ọrụ kwesịrị ịma isi ihe abụọ a.
It works well.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Physical and functional.	Ahụ na ọrụ.
There are people in need.	E nwere ndị nọ ná mkpa.
Not so in the old days, my son.	Ọ dịghị otú ahụ n'oge ochie, nwa m nwoke.
He had some problems when he started.	O nwere nsogbu ụfọdụ mgbe ọ malitere.
They run for game time.	Ha na-agba ọsọ maka oge egwuregwu.
We did the right thing, we did.	Anyị mere ezigbo ụzọ, anyị mere.
It’s a great movie.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ihe nkiri.
Mine would not be like that.	Nke m agaghị adị ka nke ahụ.
Her story is interesting.	Akụkọ ya na-atọ ụtọ.
He made himself a fool yesterday.	O mere onwe ya onye nzuzu ụnyahụ.
He wants to see it.	Ọ chọrọ ka ọ hụ.
I want you to see what is in front of you.	Achọrọ m ka ị hụ ihe dị n'ihu gị.
Only help he needed.	Naanị enyemaka ọ chọrọ.
They are not in this.	Ha adịghị na nke a.
Cannot see it now.	Enweghị ike ịhụ ya ugbu a.
At this temperature, we do not eat much.	Na okpomọkụ a, anyị anaghị eri ọtụtụ ihe.
If he is eating now.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ na-eri nri ugbu a.
Such things happen almost every day.	Ihe ndị dị otú ahụ na-eme ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ kwa ụbọchị.
What do we do?	Gịnị ka anyị na-eme?
Obviously things are not right.	O doro anya na ihe adịghị mma.
She went to the clothing store and bought new clothes.	Ọ gara ụlọ ahịa akwa akwa wee zụta uwe ọhụrụ.
Cold for everything he knows.	Oyi maka ihe niile ma ya.
It falls near this time.	Ọ dara nso n'oge a.
Their thinking is bad.	Echiche ha dị njọ.
Of course.	Nke n'ezie.
I'm happy.	Enwere m obi ụtọ.
They run well financially.	Ha na-agba ọsọ nke ọma ụgwọ.
We love each other.	Anyị hụrụ onwe anyị n'anya.
This field is required.	A chọrọ ama a.
We go everywhere, go to school, go to the grocery store.	Anyị na-aga ebe niile, gaa ụlọ akwụkwọ, gaa n'ụlọ ahịa nri.
Give them a job.	Nye ha ọrụ.
You have really good news information.	Ị nwere ozi akụkọ mara mma n'ezie.
For an hour.	Maka otu awa.
It's too bad.	Ọ dị oke njọ.
I want to.	Achọrọ m ka achọrọ m.
They are really weak.	Ha adịghị ike n'ezie.
It is our ways.	Ọ bụ ụzọ ndị anyị.
It seems to have no place.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ebe.
But that is on the side of the subject.	Mana nke ahụ dị n'akụkụ isi okwu.
He made a long journey.	O mere ogologo njem.
It was as bad as expected.	Ọ dị njọ dị ka a tụrụ anya ya.
But that would not work for my situation.	Mana nke ahụ agaghị arụ ọrụ maka ọnọdụ m.
All doubts can give it a hard truth.	Obi abụọ niile nwere ike inye ya bụ eziokwu siri ike.
We do not want it now.	Anyị achọghị ya ugbu a.
The plan is true or false.	Atụmatụ bụ eziokwu ma ọ bụ ụgha.
No one has one.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere otu.
Stay at home.	Nọrọ n'ụlọ ezumike.
There are other bars.	Enwere ụlọ mmanya ndị ọzọ.
Here, again, two things happened.	N'ebe a, ọzọ, ihe abụọ mere.
There is no bill regarding the amount.	Enweghị akwụkwọ ụgwọ gbasara ego ahụ.
They are looking for me now.	Ha na-achọ m ugbu a.
I can clearly see it from this side.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ya nke ọma site n'akụkụ a.
Of course it does for the moment.	N'ezie ọ na-eme maka oge a.
It's so delicious.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
I go to work every day.	M na-aga ọrụ kwa ụbọchị.
They are a good couple and they love each other.	Ha bụ ezigbo di na nwunye na ha hụrụ n'anya.
The good news is that no one can see them.	Ozi ọma ahụ bụ na ọ dịghị onye pụrụ ịhụ ha n'ezie.
But the reason is nothing difficult to say.	Ma ihe kpatara na ọ dịghị ihe siri ike ikwu.
Find a good man.	Nweta ezigbo nwoke.
He said he had a beautiful letter in your hand.	O kwuru na ya nwere akwụkwọ ozi mara mma n'aka gị.
We waited for the car.	Anyị chere ụgbọ ala.
The car is good.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ dị mma.
It was just as he had expected.	Ọ dị nnọọ ka ọ tụrụ anya ya.
I don’t think it is highly recommended that they are.	Echeghị m na a na-atụ aro nke ukwuu na ha bụ.
John is my bike.	John bụ igwe igwe m.
It is legal.	Ọ bụ na iwu.
This may take some time.	Nke a nwere ike were obere oge.
He did not seem surprised to see me.	O yighị ka o juru ya anya ịhụ m.
Clearly, it would have been necessary today.	N'ụzọ doro anya, ọ gaara adị mkpa taa.
This is still a bottom line.	Nke a ka bụ ohere ala ala.
He was surprised at times.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya mgbe ụfọdụ.
She is a little nervous.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya nke nta.
The car is running smoothly.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ na-agba nke ọma.
It was the perfect opportunity.	Ọ bụ ohere zuru oke.
He did not know that this place was there.	Ọ maghị na ebe a dị.
Awesome.	Nke dị egwu.
One afternoon, at my office.	Otu ehihie, na ụlọ ọrụ m.
I don't like dogs.	Nkịta anaghị amasị m.
I love this so much.	Ahụrụ m nke a n'anya nke ukwuu.
That’s what he’s doing here.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ na-eme ebe a.
We hope.	Anyị na-atụ anya.
I say a lot.	M na-ekwu ọtụtụ ihe.
One solid.	Otu siri ike.
Do what he says.	Mee ihe o kwuru.
Things like these.	Ihe dị ka ndị a.
He needs to do many things.	O kwesịrị ime ọtụtụ ihe.
We do not want to be seen.	Anyị achọghị ka a hụ anyị.

That's a bad thing.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe na-adịghị mma.
No matter what you may think at first, that’s fine.	N'agbanyeghị ihe ị nwere ike iche na mbụ, nke ahụ dị mma.
Anything else you want, you let us know.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ ị chọrọ, ị mee ka anyị mara.
But no one was around to see me.	Ma ọ dịghị onye nọ nso ịhụ m.
So he went out and ran.	Ya mere ọ pụọ na-agba ọsọ.
There is a lot of work ahead.	Enwere ọtụtụ ọrụ n'ihu.
He looked at me, his eyes bad.	O lere m anya, anya ya dị njọ.
Not me, of course.	Ọ bụghị m, n'ezie.
Not many refugees.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ndị gbara ọsọ ndụ.
That is a great and difficult task.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ọrụ siri ike.
I'm sure it is.	Eji m n'aka na ọ bụ ya.
It surprised me.	Ọ tụrụ m n'anya.
So everything is either good or bad.	Ya mere, ihe niile bụ ihe dị mma ma ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ niile.
For hours and hours.	Maka awa na awa.
This is what we do for the project.	Nke a bụ ihe anyị na-eme maka ọrụ ahụ.
So far none have.	Ruo ugbu a ọ nweghị nke nwere.

On the other hand, we thought two years.	N'aka nke ọzọ, anyị chere na afọ abụọ.

We hope he tells the truth.	Anyị tụrụ anya na o kwuru eziokwu.
That’s just one idea of ​​how it’s going to happen.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị otu echiche nke otu ọ ga-esi mee.
Of course, it should be different.	N'ezie, o kwesịrị ịdị iche.
When that happens, immediate help is extremely important.	Mgbe nke ahụ mere, enyemaka ngwa ngwa dị oke mkpa.

But none of them are human.	Ma ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha bụ mmadụ.

At the time she was her husband.	N'oge ahụ ọ bụ di ya.

Her hopes were dashed.	Olileanya ya nwụrụ.

His strength was evident.	Ike ya ama ama.
They are a bad couple, of course.	Ha bụ di na nwunye na-adịghị mma, n'ezie.
Good weather gift.	Ezi onyinye ihu igwe.
He thought his mother was cruel.	O chere na nne ya dị obi ọjọọ.

But it is up to you.	Mana ọ dị gị n'aka.
He is still unemployed and has no money.	Ọ ka enweghị ọrụ ma ha enweghị ego.
The truth about the truth is that they exist.	Eziokwu banyere eziokwu bụ na ha dị adị.
Which of the following is the best?	Kedu nke kacha mma n'ime ihe ndị a?
Many others can be named.	Enwere ike ịkpọ ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ aha.

All is well so far.	Ihe niile dị mma ruo ugbu a.
But he did not want to leave on his own.	Ma ọ chọghị ịpụ n'onwe ya.
There is no need to do anything else.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ime ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.

Suddenly, he could cook.	Na mberede, o nwere ike esi nri.
That was only a few days ago.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị ụbọchị ole na ole gara aga.
No, it is not.	Mba, ọ bụghị.
The drug should be used only if necessary.	Ekwesịrị iji ọgwụ ahụ naanị ma ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mkpa.
Nice thing to say.	Ihe mara mma ikwu.
That's how it got to me.	Otú ahụ ka o si nweta m.
You see, he loves old houses.	Ị hụrụ, ọ hụrụ ụlọ ochie n'anya.
Not in them, in itself.	Ọ bụghị na ha, n'onwe ya.
Life is crowded around the city.	Ndụ juru n'akụkụ obodo ahụ.
Everything he says will not make sense.	Ihe ọ bụla o kwuru agaghị enwe isi.
In the second, it does not work.	Na nke abụọ, ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
These questions are very good.	Ajụjụ ndị a dị mma nke ukwuu.

Of course, there are still a few difficult ones.	N'ezie, a ka nwere ndị siri ike ole na ole dị.

There the women go ahead of the men.	Ebe ahụ ka ụmụ nwanyị na-aga n'ihu ụmụ nwoke.
He hates traveling at night.	Ọ kpọrọ ịga njem n'abalị asị.
You have to do everything.	Ị ga-eme ihe niile.
The water is not fast.	Mmiri adịghị ngwa ngwa.
I travel, a lot.	M na-eme njem, ọtụtụ.
But he doesn't want to do it.	Ma ọ chọghị ime ya.
He started painting the house two weeks ago.	Ọ malitere ịgba ụlọ ahụ izu abụọ gara aga.
This can be done in a variety of ways.	Enwere ike ime nke a n'ụzọ dị iche iche.
That made me a leader.	Nke ahụ mere ka m bụrụ onye isi.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.

Something different actually happened.	Ihe dị iche mere n'ezie.
This is a happy day.	Nke a bụ ụbọchị obi ụtọ.
Of course I am not the type.	N'ezie abụghị m ụdị.

But now this.	Ma ugbu a, nke a.
Others are just scared.	Ndị ọzọ na-atụ naanị egwu.
I feel like I have no time.	Ọ dị m ka ọ nweghị oge.
Pretty much impossible.	Nke mara mma nke ukwuu agaghị ekwe omume.
This house is in a good location.	Ụlọ a dị n'ebe dị mma.

It is your time now.	Ọ bụ oge gị ugbu a.
Maybe things are better now.	Ma eleghị anya, ihe dị mma ugbu a.
So we left.	Anyị wee pụọ na ya.
Water is a great time for hiking.	Mmiri bụ oge dị mma maka njem njem.
The way, the long way.	Ụzọ, ụzọ dị anya.
The idea required a new kind of word.	Echiche ahụ chọrọ ụdị okwu ọhụrụ.
I feel like he won’t do it on time.	Enwere m mmetụta na ọ gaghị eme ya n'oge.
It will never be the same.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-abụ otu ihe ahụ.
This information is critical.	Ozi a dị oke egwu.
But that happens.	Ma nke ahụ na-eme.
This can be seen in a number of ways.	Enwere ike ịhụ nke a n'ụzọ dị iche iche.
He did not want them to feel that way.	Ọ chọghị ka ha hụ otú obi dị ya.
The house is in a beautiful place.	Ụlọ ahụ dị n'ebe mara mma.
I dreaded all the time when he was alone.	M na-atụ egwu oge niile mgbe ọ bụ naanị ya.
It was a really fun trip.	Ọ bụ njem na-atọ ụtọ n'ezie.
He has a brother.	O nwere nwanne.
He expected it.	Ọ tụrụ anya ya.
But that is not what it is.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị ihe ọ bụ.
I can move on.	Enwere m ike ịga n'ihu.
This statement will always be false.	Okwu a ga-abụ ụgha mgbe niile.
I just try to help.	Naanị m na-agbalị inyere aka.
We are real and we are not afraid to be ourselves.	Anyị bụ ndị ezigbo na anyị anaghị atụ egwu ịbụ onwe anyị.
Always looking for the good.	Na-achọ ihe ọma mgbe niile.
Still, he is courageous.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, o nwere nnọọ obi ike.
That certainly is nonsense.	N'ezie nke ahụ bụ okwu nzuzu.
But he still needs to do it.	Ma ọ ka kwesịrị ime ya.
Of course so far it is not a terrible thing.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ka ọ dị ugbu a abụghị ihe dị egwu.
That is very good.	Nke ahụ dị mma nke ukwuu.

I’ll tell you about this little snack.	Aga m agwa gị maka obere nri nri a.

The newspaper was suspended for several weeks.	A kwụsịrị akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ ruo ọtụtụ izu.
But it calmed me down.	Ma o mere ka ahụ́ ruo m ala.
The store is famous for its quality.	Ụlọ ahịa a ma ama maka ịdị mma ya.
Of course, there are limits to the current activity.	N'ezie, enwere oke na ọrụ dị ugbu a.
No one is around.	Ọ dịghị onye nọ nso.

From money to power.	Site na ego wee nweta ike.

But these methods have different limits.	Mana ụzọ ndị a nwere oke dị iche iche.

Sometimes you just have to go for the water.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, naanị ị ga-eji mmiri ahụ aga.
I still think about it.	M ka na-eche banyere ya.

The parents knew their son.	Nne na nna ahụ mara nwa ha nwoke.

You do not know what the situation will be like.	Ị maghị ihe ọnọdụ ga-abụ.

For my husband, his life is his job with us.	Maka di m, ndụ ya bụ ọrụ ya na anyị.

But there are some more important issues.	Ma enwere ụfọdụ okwu dị mkpa karịa.
He is not a good father.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo nna nọ ebe ahụ.

But he really died.	Ma ọ nwụrụ n'ezie.

They both have their challenges.	Ha abụọ nwere ihe ịma aka ha.
They do not like to talk about it.	Ha adịghị amasị ikwu banyere ya.
The policeman left them alone.	Onye uwe ojii ahụ hapụrụ ha naanị ha.
I just think you need someone else.	Naanị m chere na ị chọrọ onye ọzọ.
It's really hard.	O siri ike n'ezie.

The journey was difficult but worth it.	Njem ahụ siri ike mana ọ bara uru.
Just do it.	Naanị mee ya.
Should be very helpful.	Kwesịrị inye aka nke ukwuu.
Doctors suggested he should sit out a game.	Ndị dọkịta tụrụ aro ka ọ nọrọ ọdụ otu egwuregwu.
Until my birthday.	Ruo ụbọchị ọmụmụ m.
The monkey town lives nearby.	Obodo enwe bi nso.

Over the next three months.	N'ime ọnwa atọ na-abịa.
This is a good one.	Nke a bụ ezigbo otu.
No one was there.	O nweghị onye nọ ebe ahụ.
You will not have a second chance.	Ị gaghị enwe ohere nke abụọ.
The students were amazed.	O juru ụmụ akwụkwọ ahụ anya.
One great photo.	Otu foto kacha mma.
He is a big brother.	Ọ bụ nnukwu nwanne.
Whatever it was, this man was not.	Ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ, nwoke a abụghị ya.
It is inside.	Ọ bụ n'ime.
None of this is easy to imagine.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ dị mfe iche echiche.
He is known for speaking the truth.	A maara ya maka ikwu eziokwu.
Many died there from starvation and disease.	Ọtụtụ ndị nwụrụ n'ebe ahụ n'ihi agụụ na ọrịa.
During that time.	N'ime oge ahụ.
You just can't see them.	Naanị ị gaghị ahụ ha.
Tell me what you think.	Gwa m ihe ị chere.
The worst is yet to come.	Nke kacha njọ ka na-abịa.
He immediately felt better.	Ozugbo ahụ ọ dị ya mma.
Like a river.	Dị ka osimiri.
On this journey, that will happen.	Na njem a, nke ahụ ga-eme.
Every woman wants.	Nwanyị ọ bụla chọrọ.
Obviously he had that.	O doro anya na o nwere nke ahụ.
But here we are.	Ma ebe a anyị nọ.
But not now, not next year.	Ma ọ bụghị ugbu a, ọ bụghị n'afọ ọzọ.
All those questions are difficult.	Ajụjụ ndị ahụ niile siri ike.
The kind you want from your best friend.	Ụdị nke ị chọrọ n'aka ezigbo enyi gị.
I mean, really.	M kwuru n'ezie, mgbe.
Need to have a car.	Mkpa inwe ụgbọ ala.
This is what we want to do about it.	Nke a bụ ihe anyị chọrọ ime maka ya.
He did not know what was required.	Ọ maghị ihe a chọrọ.
Her parents refused to talk about what had happened.	Nne na nna ya jụrụ ikwu banyere ihe merenụ.
He should ride fast.	O kwesịrị ịnya ngwa ngwa.
So let’s see what we can do with a little information.	Ya mere, ka anyị hụ ihe anyị nwere ike iji obere ozi mee.
I saw them when they were still like this.	Ahụrụ m ha mgbe ha ka dị ka nke a.
I need a newspaper now more than this.	Achọrọ m akwụkwọ akụkọ dị ugbu a karịa nke a.
It feels different now.	O nwere mmetụta dị iche ugbu a.
Examples can be found everywhere.	Enwere ike ịhụ ihe atụ n'ebe niile.
Tell me.	Gwa m.
This is his point.	Nke a bụ isi ihe ya.
I can't believe it in my own eyes.	Apụghị m ikweta n'anya nke m.
His car suddenly stopped.	Igwe ụgbọ ala ya kwụsịrị na mberede.
She is very smart.	Ọ mara nnọọ ihe.
We are coming a long way.	Anyị na-abịa ogologo ụzọ.
He just nodded.	Naanị isi ka ọ tụrụ ya.
He has a little bit of a clear idea.	O nwere ntakịrị echiche doro anya.
He does not seem to have good friends.	O yighị ka o nwere ezigbo ndị enyi.
We love.	Anyị hụrụ n'anya.
I was close to him.	M nọ ya nso.
That fell apart.	Nke ahụ dara.
Not a problem at all.	Ọ bụghị nsogbu ma ọlị.
He doesn't know anyone there.	Ọ maghị onye ọ bụla n'ebe ahụ.
Now, three questions.	Ugbu a, ajụjụ atọ.
He looked at his watch as it began to spin.	O lere anya na elekere ya ka ọ malitere ịgba.
Then there are the words.	Mgbe ahụ, e nwere ọtụtụ okwu.
He can do this in different ways.	Ọ nwere ike ime nke a ụzọ dị iche iche.
Clearly, the benefits have come.	N'ụzọ doro anya, e nwetara uru ahụ.
She lost her baby.	Ọ dara ibu nwa ya.
I would like help.	Ọ ga-amasị m enyemaka.
They work, and fast.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ, na ngwa ngwa.
Not all of them go there.	Ha niile anaghị aga ebe ahụ.
It doesn’t seem like a big deal.	O yighị ka ọ bụ nnukwu ihe.
If he wanted to, he could get away with it.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ chọrọ, o nwere ike isi na ihe a niile pụọ.
They are wise and they are here.	Ha mara ihe ma ha nọ ebe a.
He came to me immediately.	Ọ bịara m ozugbo ahụ.
But it is perfect.	Mana ọ zuru oke.
I still need one.	M ka chọrọ otu.
Talk to my son, he said.	Gwa nwa m nwoke okwu, o kwuru.
You can better me.	Ị nwere ike m mma.
It was easy to see that it was a rainy day.	Ọ dị mfe ịhụ na ọ bụ ụbọchị oke mmiri juru.
They told us we knew nothing.	Ha gwara anyị na anyị amaghị ihe ọ bụla.
But there is something.	Ma enwere ihe.
We know he loves his job.	Anyị maara na ọ hụrụ ọrụ ya n'anya.
I want to say.	Achọrọ m ikwu.
I am not the only one who understands this.	Ọ bụghị naanị m ghọtara nke a.
We are accustomed to the sun.	Anwụ mara anyị ahụ́.
The first one died.	Nke mbụ nwụrụ.
There is food and water.	Enwere nri na mmiri.
When this happens.	Mgbe nke a mere.
He burned many of them.	Ọ kpọrọ ọtụtụ n’ime ha ọkụ.
He said it took time.	O kwuru na o were oge.
He is my son.	Ọ bụ nwa m nwoke.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
This can be done as follows.	Enwere ike ime nke a dị ka ndị a.
I do not have such an interest.	Enweghị m mmasị dị otú ahụ.
They are the same mindset.	Ha bụ otu ụdị uche.
It’s not a good day for our kids, one way or another.	Ọ bụghị ụbọchị dị mma maka ụmụ anyị, otu ụzọ ma ọ bụ ọzọ.
Whatever this is.	Ihe ọ bụla nke a bụ.

I'll have a good time.	Aga m enwe ezigbo oge.
Many years ago.	Ọtụtụ gara aga.
Because he wanted to see her.	N'ihi na ọ chọrọ ịhụ ya.
They talked about you so much.	Ha kwuru gbasara gị nke ukwuu.
You have your hands up.	Ị nwere aka gị elu.
He looked at the clock in his hand.	O lere anya na elekere dị n'aka ya.
This year more than ever.	Afọ a karịa mgbe ọ bụla.
It's just a joke.	Ọ bụ naanị ịnya igwe ọchị.

Anyone can help me.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ike inyere m aka.
In many newspapers.	Na ọtụtụ akwụkwọ akụkọ.
But of course everyone knows he will not live.	Mana n'ezie onye ọ bụla maara na ọ gaghị adị ndụ.
The worst thing here is violence.	Ihe kacha mara ebe a bụ ime ihe ike.
They are workers.	Ha bụ ndị ọrụ.
Caring for you and your family.	Na-eche maka gị na ezinụlọ gị.
A friend gave me this book.	Otu enyi nyere m akwụkwọ a.

The first is, as always, marketing.	Nke mbụ bụ, dị ka mgbe ọ bụla, ahịa.
I think he was there.	Echere m na ọ nọ ebe ahụ.
But this is not his story.	Ma nke a abụghị akụkọ ya.
That is to think about human activity.	Ihe ahụ bụ iche echiche banyere ọrụ mmadụ.
So if you don't have a friend, be a friend.	Ya mere, ọ bụrụ na i nweghị enyi, bụrụ enyi.
Of course ,.	N'ezie,.
He had an idea.	O nwere echiche.
His attitude is tremendous.	Omume ya dị egwu.
They are both very beautiful.	Ha abụọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
I love playing it.	Ahụrụ m egwu ya n'anya.
It is a story you have told them.	Ọ bụ akụkọ ị nyere ha.

He has no spirit.	O nweghị mmụọ.
It will be a hot season soon.	Ọ ga-abụ oge ọkụ n'oge adịghị anya.
It will be fine anyway.	Ọ ga-adị mma n'agbanyeghị.
They carried the story forward in a practical way.	Ha mere ka akụkọ ahụ gaa n'ihu n'ụzọ na-arụ ọrụ.
It should seat many people.	O kwesịrị ka ọ nọrọ ọtụtụ mmadụ ọdụ.
But I'm fine.	Mana ọ dị m mma.
It can be.	O nwere ike ịbụ.
Police were notified immediately.	A gwara ndị uwe ojii ihe merenụ ozugbo.
Of course, there is no such thing.	N'ezie, o nweghị otu.
Their main function is weight.	Isi ọrụ ha bụ ibu ibu.
You are alone, baby.	Ị nọ naanị gị, nwa.
I said it was stupid.	M kwuru na ọ bụ nzuzu.
I left the office.	M siri n'ụlọ ọrụ pụọ.
It's a lot of money.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ego.
It was always when he was a child.	Ọ bụ mgbe ọ bụla ọ bụ nwata.
The pleasures of life.	Ihe ụtọ nke ndụ.
Come with your family home.	Bịa na ezinụlọ gị n'ụlọ.
But he did not know where he was.	Ma ọ maghị ebe ọ nọ.
This is a fight issue.	Nke a bụ okwu ọgụ.

These are the cases.	Ndị a bụ ikpe.
It happened in his own house.	O mere n’ụlọ nke ya.
This is a story that comes together.	Nke a bụ akụkọ ihe mere eme na-abịa ọnụ.
Long sleeves are not comfortable.	Ogologo uwe aka na-adịghị mma.

A well-known actor from this city.	Onye na-eme ihe nkiri ama ama si obodo a.
It may be the other way around.	O nwere ike ịbụ ụzọ ọzọ.
And he ate the second one.	O wee rie nke abụọ.

He speaks only when he wants to.	Ọ na-ekwu naanị mgbe ọ chọrọ.

The only difference is that he is taller than me.	Naanị ihe dị iche bụ na ọ ka m ogologo.
There is no hope for them.	O nweghị olileanya maka ha.
I love the girl.	Ahụrụ m nwa agbọghọ ahụ n'anya.
It is our responsibility to be the only ones.	Ọ bụ ọrụ anyị ịbụ naanị nke ahụ.
That is what the two girls did.	Otú ahụ ka ụmụ agbọghọ abụọ ahụ mere.
Let them know it did.	Mee ka ha mara na o mere.

She was in tears.	Anya mmiri gbara ya.
That is a big job.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ọrụ.

However, that is clearly not the case.	Otú ọ dị, o doro anya na ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
But not for man.	Ma ọ bụghị maka mmadụ.

And some for thirty years, and some for twenty.	Ma ụfọdụ ruo iri afọ atọ, ma ụfọdụ ruo iri abụọ.
I like them very much.	Ha na-amasị m nke ukwuu.
Is there a little sense here ?.	Enwere ntakịrị uche ebe a?.
He fell asleep quickly.	Ụra dara ya ngwa ngwa.
More than money.	Ihe karịrị ego.
However, someone else had.	Otú ọ dị, onye ọzọ nwere.
And stay there, or more.	Ma nọrọ ebe ahụ, ma ọ bụ karịa.
Sometimes I was scared.	Ụjọ na-atụ m mgbe ụfọdụ.

However, that will happen.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ ga-eme.

We express our opinion on the story.	Anyị na-ekwu uche anyị banyere akụkọ.
They should be one thing, or the other.	Ha kwesịrị ịbụ otu ihe, ma ọ bụ nke ọzọ.
The baby seems to be coming soon.	Nwa ọhụrụ ahụ dị ka ọ na-abịa ngwa ngwa.
He found this to be extremely alarming.	Ọ hụrụ na nke a dị oke egwu.

And nothing happened to it.	Na ihe ọ bụla mere na ya.

How could they possibly be so cruel?	Olee otú ha ga-esi nwee obi ọjọọ otú ahụ?
I loved everything about tonight.	Ahụrụ m ihe niile gbasara abalị a n'anya.
In the meantime, he recommends that everyone take it.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, ọ na-atụ aro ka onye ọ bụla were ya.
He told them that he was very near.	Ọ gwara ha na ọ dị ezigbo nso.
That is, we need good news.	Ya bụ, anyị chọrọ ozi ọma.

This is great news for the city.	Nke a bụ nnukwu ozi maka obodo ahụ.
Of course customers are afraid to leave.	N'ezie ndị ahịa na-atụ ụjọ pụọ.
I can not say that.	Enweghị m ike ikwu nke ahụ.
At the moment, it is small, by the way.	N'oge a, ọ dị obere, n'agbanyeghị.
He came to the meeting.	Ọ bịara nzukọ ahụ.
He has a chance.	O nwere ohere.
I did not see anything else.	Ahụghị m ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
Do it for your words or phrases.	Mee ya maka okwu gị ma ọ bụ okwu gị.
The man was all right.	Ọ dịghị ihe mere nwoke ahụ.

You just have to have good energy.	Naanị ị ga-achọ ike ike dị mma.
Tears welled up in her eyes.	Anya mmiri juru ya anya ọzọ.

He went to their side.	Ọ gara n’akụkụ ha.

Going out the window he looked inside.	Na-aga na windo ọ lere anya n'ime.
He did not want to talk about it.	Ọ chọghị ikwu banyere ya.
I was very angry.	Iwe were m nke ukwuu.

For a long time nothing happened.	Ruo ogologo oge ọ dịghị ihe merenụ.

But it does matter much more than that.	Mana ọ gbasara ọtụtụ ihe karịa nke ahụ kwa.

That was a short time ago.	Nke ahụ bụ obere oge gara aga.
Not so with many women.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka ọ dị ọtụtụ ụmụ nwanyị.
Now where are those needs?	Ugbu a olee ebe mkpa ndị ahụ nọ?
I just thought.	Naanị m chere.

It's not good.	Ọ dịghị mma mma.
And something better than nothing.	Na ihe dị mma karịa ihe ọ bụla.

You can travel at night.	Ị nwere ike ịga njem n'abalị.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Ọ dịghị ihe ka njọ.
Why should it.	Gịnị mere ọ ga-eji .
He and his wife have two children.	Ya na nwunye ya nwere ụmụ abụọ.
And bad for everyone.	Na ihe ọjọọ maka onye ọ bụla.
The head of state is a black man.	Onye isi ala bụ onye isi ojii.
But not how you think it is.	Ma ọ bụghị otú i chere na ọ bụ.
You eat it.	Ị na-eri ya.
Get the money.	Nweta ego ahụ.
You do not want him to be alone.	Ị chọghị ka ọ nọrọ naanị ya.

Of his sons.	Nke ụmụ ya.

The boy's father arrived yesterday afternoon.	Nna nwa ahụ rutere n'ehihie ụnyaahụ.

And some customers just want some features.	Na ụfọdụ ndị ahịa chọrọ naanị ụfọdụ atụmatụ.
Now this is low.	Ugbu a nke a dị ala.
It has its benefits.	O nwere uru ya.
Of course, there is nothing good or bad.	N'ezie, ọ dịghị ihe dị mma ma ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ.

But about your information.	Mana gbasara ozi gị.
Sometimes when you are with people, you feel it.	Mgbe ụfọdụ mgbe gị na ndị mmadụ nọ, ị na-enwe mmetụta.

He gave her a man's dress.	O nyere ya uwe nwoke.

Nothing was asked of him.	Ọ dịghị ihe a jụrụ ya.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	Ọ dị ka ezigbo echiche n'oge ahụ.

In most cases, everything works as expected.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ dị ka a tụrụ anya ya.
It is not an easy task.	Ọ bụghị ihe dị mfe ime.

But now, what you are doing is very good.	Mana ugbu a, ihe ị na-eme dị ezigbo mma.
You do not want to be there.	Ị gaghị achọ ịnọ ebe ahụ.

The key is their feelings.	Isi okwu bụ mmetụta ha.

They looked at each other.	Ha lere onwe ha anya na anya.

It can be bigger, bigger.	Ọ nwere ike ịdị ukwuu, ka ukwuu.
Maybe there is something to that.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị ihe na nke ahụ.
For a time, he was deeply hated.	Ruo oge ụfọdụ, a kpọrọ ya asị nke ukwuu.
Everyone in the countryside has their own car.	Onye ọ bụla nọ n'ime ime obodo nwere ụgbọ ala nke ya.

At first but it was very good.	Na mbụ mana ọ dị mma nke ukwuu.
The chief was not present.	Onye isi ahụ anọghị ya.
It is, but it is not.	Ọ bụ, ma ọ bụghị.
But the big picture is that it is coming.	Mana nnukwu foto bụ na ọ na-abịa.
I wonder where he came from.	M na-eche ebe o si bịa.
New.	Nke ọhụrụ.
They talked to each other.	Ha gwara ibe ha okwu.
Long time no see for that now.	Ogologo oge maka nke ahụ ugbu a.
Solitude is not what we want.	Ịnọ naanị ya abụghị ihe anyị na-achọ.
Probably not long.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị ogologo oge.
There is no other way.	Enweghị ụzọ ọzọ.
He would never do such a thing.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-eme ụdị ihe ahụ.
We are in it together.	Anyị nọ na ya ọnụ.
That will not work.	Nke ahụ agaghị arụ ọrụ.
I wonder what happened to those people.	M na-eche ihe mere ndị ahụ.
Like the woman herself.	Dị ka nwanyị ahụ n'onwe ya.
The thought took her by surprise.	Echiche ahụ tụrụ ya n’anya.
Only the hand I thought.	Naanị aka ahụ ka m chere.
As you would do at home.	Dị ka ị ga-eme n'ụlọ.
We do what everyone else does.	Anyị na-eme ihe onye ọ bụla ọzọ na-eme.
I want to see someone inside me again.	Achọrọ m ịhụ mmadụ n'ime m ọzọ.
In their own kind.	Na ụdị nke ha.
He can see it now.	O nwere ike ịhụ ya ugbu a.
I do not want.	Achọghị m.
He looked around the house.	O lere anya gburugburu ụlọ ahụ.
I can not do it.	Enweghị m ike ime ya.
First, pets.	Nke mbụ, anụ ụlọ.
There is a reasonable market.	Enwere ezi uche nke ahịa.
But for us it was only husband and children.	Ma maka anyị ọ bụ naanị di na ụmụ.
Just this week !.	Naanị izu a!.
It still works.	Ọ ka na-arụ ọrụ.
Earlier, he hated her.	Tupu mgbe ahụ, ọ kpọrọ ya asị.
Doing it quickly is.	Ime ya ngwa ngwa bụ.
The feeling was cruel.	Mmetụta ahụ dị obi ọjọọ.
But it is clear.	Ma o doro anya.
What is he doing?	Gịnị ka ọ na-eme.
But there is something about it.	Ma enwere ihe gbasara ya.
I do not care.	Achọghị m ịma.
This is not like you.	Nke a adịghị ka gị.
Some others are not.	Ụfọdụ ndị ọzọ adịghị.
He is very wise.	Ọ mara ihe nke ukwuu.
I told him thirty.	Agwara m ya iri atọ.
Somehow, this makes sense.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, nke a nwere ezi uche.
We finally did.	Anyị mechara mee.
So I did.	Ya mere m mere.
But there is a problem here.	Mana enwere nsogbu ebe a.
He ran ahead.	Ọ gbara ọsọ n'ihu.
His thoughts went out.	Echiche ya wee pụọ.
Have a little breakfast, talk to the men.	Nwee obere nri ụtụtụ, gwa ụmụ nwoke okwu.
It is so much bigger than here.	Ọ dị nnọọ ukwuu karịa ebe a.
You say it yourself, every month.	I kwuru ya n'onwe gị, ọ bụla ọnwa.
I do not like it.	Ahụghị m ụtọ ya.
Get out of here.	Si ebe a pụọ.
Is it dangerous.	Ọ dị egwu.
He will look for the place he is going to.	Ọ ga-achọ ebe ahụ ọ na-aga.
He took a good look at the little boat.	O lere obere ụgbọ ahụ anya nke ọma.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
He shot the three balls well.	Ọ gbara bọọlụ atọ ahụ nke ọma.
He sat and waited.	Ọ nọdụ ala chere.
They will keep you moving forward.	Ha ga-eme ka ị na-aga n'ihu.
I love beautiful clothes.	Ahụrụ m uwe mara mma n'anya.
So far everything is working fine.	Ruo ugbu a ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
I do not know how.	Amaghị m ka ọ ga-esi.
We can help each other both small and small.	Anyị nwere ike inyere ibe anyị aka ma obere.
But let us not look so different.	Ma ka anyị na-adịghị otú anya iche.
Many of the fish died.	Ọtụtụ azụ̀ ahụ nwụrụ.
It is impossible for the weather in this situation.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume maka ihu igwe na ọnọdụ a.
And he waited.	O wee chere.
She did not know she was pregnant.	Ọ maghị na ọ dị ime.
We had a chance to say it.	Anyị nwetara ohere ikwu ya.
Those words are real.	Okwu ndị ahụ dị adị.
He knows both.	Ọ maara ha abụọ.
You do it again.	I mee ya ọzọ.
But you made it into a song.	Ma i mere ya ka ọ bụrụ abụ.
Some are obviously high.	Ụfọdụ doro anya na ihe dị elu.
That can do it.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ime ya.
Sailors are currently working on it.	Ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri na-arụ ọrụ na ya ugbu a.
Sadly, most of us do.	Ọ dị nwute na ọtụtụ n'ime anyị na-eme nke ahụ.

Make the game simple.	Mee egwuregwu dị mfe.
I want to see you come.	Achọrọ m ịhụ ka ị bịara.
She was making three beds at a time.	Ọ nọ na-atụ akwa atọ n'otu oge.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
There is beauty everywhere.	Enwere mma ebe niile.
Whatever one is.	Ọ bụla onye bụ.
Now you know better than this new thing.	Ugbu a, ị maara karịa ihe ọhụrụ a.
I have enough money.	Enwere m ego zuru oke.
Everything went well.	Ihe niile gara nke ọma.
Maybe it's okay.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị mma.
This is unreasonable.	Nke a enweghị ezi uche.
Just a little.	Naanị obere.
I hope you will help.	Enwere m olileanya na unu ga-enyere aka.
What is your next three days?	Kedu ihe bụ ụbọchị atọ gị ọzọ.
It’s perfect for it.	O zuru oke maka ya.
But that night he was very happy.	Ma n’abalị ahụ, obi dị ya ụtọ nke ukwuu.
However, there is.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ihe.
This small town faces many challenges.	Obere obodo a na-eche ọtụtụ ihe ịma aka ihu.
How to do it.	Otu esi eme ya.
I am not alone in this.	Ọ bụghị naanị m ka ihe a mere.
Male name.	Aha nwoke.
They can be seen near the hospital.	Enwere ike ịhụ ha n'akụkụ ụlọ ọgwụ.
Time is everything in life.	Oge bụ ihe niile na ndụ.
To give me a car at home.	Iji nye m ụgbọ ala n'ụlọ.
They did.	Ha mere.
His small face was ugly and ugly.	Obere ihu ya dị njọ ma dị njọ.
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
I spent some time there.	M nọrọ oge ụfọdụ ebe ahụ.
None of that happened here.	Ọ dịghị nke mere ebe a.
You are not a good person.	Ị bụghị ezigbo mmadụ.
He tried a second time.	Ọ gbalịrị nke ugboro abụọ.
I feel like	Ọ dị m ka m.
They are wise, but that is not wise.	Ha mara ihe, mana ọ bụghị nke ahụ maara ihe.
It belongs to her mother.	Ọ bụ nke nne ya.
Not that he should have, but he did.	Ọ bụghị na o kwesịrị inwe, ma o mere.
Talk to someone.	Gwa mmadụ okwu.
No clothes.	Enweghị uwe.
Soon things will get worse.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, ihe ga-adị njọ n'ezie.
What could be more relaxing?	Kedu ihe nwere ike ịbụ izu ike karịa?
There is nothing he can do to stop it.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ pụrụ ime iji kwụsị ya.
It was a busy week.	Ọ bụ izu ọrụ n'aka.
I want to be a minister.	Achọrọ m ịbụ onye ozi.
Short term.	Obere oge.
It’s not cruel, but it lacks life and emotion.	Ọ bụghị obi ọjọọ, ma enweghị ndụ na mmetụta.
But it's a good movie.	Ma ọ bụ ezigbo ihe nkiri.
It’s a great time for music.	Ọ bụ nnukwu oge maka egwu.
So they are more willing to do it.	Ya mere, ha dị njikere karịa ime ya.
They do not have any powerful words.	Ha enweghị ụdị okwu ọ bụla dị ike.
The man was right.	Nwoke ahụ kwuru eziokwu.
There is no benefit left to him.	Ọ dịghị uru hapụrụ ya.
I don’t think it would look like this.	Echeghị m na ọ ga-adị ka nke a.
He was almost successful.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ nwee ihe ịga nke ọma.
What he does know is that he is real.	Ihe ọ maara bụ na ọ dị adị.
The journalist is a well-known employee.	Onye nta akụkọ ahụ bụ onye ọrụ a ma ama.
I do not like them.	Enweghị m mmasị na ha.
As they do.	Dị ka ha na-eme.
They are tough.	Ha siri ike.
My family could not believe it.	Ezinụlọ m enweghị ike ikweta.

I need to tell you something.	M kwesịrị ịgwa gị ihe.
They don’t do much.	Ha anaghị eme nke ukwuu.
In my eyes.	N'anya m.
They do not exist.	Ha adịghị adị.
That’s what it’s all about.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ bụ maka.
I loved the look.	Ahụrụ m anya ahụ n'anya.
This is a delicious meal.	Nke a bụ nri na-atọ ụtọ.
It’s small and fast, like me.	Ọ dị obere na ngwa ngwa, dị ka m.
They know him well.	Ha maara ya nke ọma.
Nothing but trouble.	Ọ dịghị ihe ma nsogbu.
But thus we are a new man.	Ma otu a anyị bụ nwoke ọhụrụ.
It's just that we are.	Ọ bụ naanị na anyị bụ.
I was with them in the afternoon.	Mụ na ha nọrọ n'ehihie.
The case went on for months.	Okwu ikpe ahụ gara n'ihu ruo ọtụtụ ọnwa.
There are no male models, or women.	Ọ dịghị nwoke ọ bụla ụdị, ma ọ bụ ụmụ nwanyị.
But they left it at that.	Ma ha hapụrụ ya na nke ahụ.
I'm sorry.	Ọ dị m nwute.
It will be fast.	Ọ ga-adị ngwa ngwa.
But it's very good.	Mana ọ dị ezigbo mma.
You get only one life.	Ị nweta naanị otu ndụ.
I'm trying to do.	M na-agbalị ime.
There is no doubt that they are true to him.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na ha bụ eziokwu nye ya.
The boy is scared.	Nwata na-atụ ụjọ.
They know each other, they are together.	Ha maara ibe ha, ha nọ ọnụ.
I want to join them.	Achọrọ m iso ha.
I know he has.	Ama m na o nwere.
Why would he ever do that?	Gịnị mere ọ ga-eji mee ụdị ihe ahụ.
She is wearing a beautiful dress.	O yi uwe mara mma.
I think it can work.	M na-eche na ọ nwere ike na-arụ ọrụ.
I do it every day.	Ana m eme ya kwa ụbọchị.
Let's talk about it.	Ka anyị na ya nwee okwu.
One is better than the other.	Otu a ka ọ dị mma karịa nke ọzọ.
He put in the work.	O tinyere ọrụ ahụ.
And false.	Na ụgha.
Either way.	Otú ọ bụla a ga-esi mee ya.
Let things happen.	Ka ihe mee.
I love these things.	Ahụrụ m ihe ndị a n'anya.
There are ten people in the room.	Mmadụ iri nọ n'ime ụlọ ahụ.
O mere.	O mere.
I am very busy at work today.	Enwere m nnọọ ọrụ n'aka na ọrụ taa.
But this time he is angry.	Ma n'oge a, o were iwe.
But your father did not.	Ma nna gị emeghị otú ahụ.
It goes both ways.	Ọ na-aga n'ụzọ abụọ.
I would never do that.	Agaghị m eme ụdị ihe ahụ.
The shirt was made of solid material.	E ji ihe siri ike mee uwe elu ahụ.
They do not have the same customer opinion.	Ha enweghị otu echiche nke ndị ahịa.
That would be a big deal.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ nnukwu ihe.
I needed to find him at his house.	Ekwesịrị m ịchọta ya n'ụlọ ya.
I see that now.	Ahụrụ m nke ahụ ugbu a.
But the key word is ‘example’.	Mana isi okwu bụ 'ihe atụ'.
So boys.	Ya mere ụmụ nwoke.
They are close to each other.	Ha na ibe ha nso.
I think you will not be here.	Echere m na ị gaghị anọ ebe a.
They work all the time.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ mgbe niile.
To be an example.	Iji bụrụ ihe atụ.
He was taking drugs.	Ọ na-aṅụ ọgwụ ike.
Wait, this is not the same.	Chere, nke a abụghị otu.
I miss him.	A na m atụ uche ya.
I told my family, my husband about it.	Agwara m ezinụlọ m, di m banyere ya.
It tastes good.	O nwere ụtọ ụtọ.
He spoke again.	O kwuru okwu ọzọ.
Come home and talk to me.	Bịa n'ụlọ gwa m okwu.
Get the phone and everything.	Nweta ekwentị na ihe niile.
You go there waiting for your customers.	Ị na-aga n'ebe ahụ chere ndị ahịa gị.
It was smaller than he expected.	Ọ dị obere karịa ka ọ tụrụ anya ya.
It's good on the water.	Ọ dị mma na mmiri.
It really makes you strong.	Ọ na-eme gị ike n'ezie.
The meeting did not go well.	Nzukọ ahụ emeghị nke ọma.
I say it is impossible.	M na-ekwu na ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
I am happy now.	Obi dị m ụtọ ugbu a.
Be honest about your feelings.	Na-ekwu eziokwu banyere otú ọ dị gị.
You did not go to the meeting yesterday.	Ị gaghị aga nzukọ ụnyahụ.
A good person can do the same.	Ezi mmadụ nwere ike ime otu ihe ahụ.
It can be overwhelming.	Ọ nwere ike ịdị oke egwu.
One day at a time, it goes on and on.	Otu ụbọchị n'otu oge, ọ na-aga n'ihu.
We can still see each other.	Anyị ka nwere ike ịhụ ibe anyị.
To this day we do.	Ruo taa anyị na-eme.
The latter is as difficult as the first.	Nke ikpeazụ siri ike dị ka nke mbụ dị mfe.
Will make another.	Ga-eme ka ọzọ.
Maybe he did it all.	Ma eleghị anya, o mere ihe niile.
For me, one thing is certain.	Maka m, otu ihe doro anya.
Not here, not for him.	Ọ bụghị ebe a, ọ bụghị maka ya.
It's a little important for a longer term.	Ọ dị ntakịrị mkpa maka ogologo okwu.
The cost is for one person.	Ụgwọ ahụ bụ maka otu onye.
He wants to.	Ọ chọrọ.
But then he saw it.	Ma mgbe ahụ, ọ hụrụ ya.
We are the only way out.	Anyị bụ naanị ụzọ pụọ.
Up and down, up and down.	Elu na ala, elu na ala.
Sometimes, though, that is not easy.	Otú ọ dị, mgbe ụfọdụ ọ dịghị mfe otú ahụ.
There does not seem to be anything wrong with his body.	O yighị ka o nweghị ihe ọjọọ na ahụ ya.
But it is not really so.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ọ dị n'ezie.
Someone at the door.	Onye nọ n'ọnụ ụzọ.
He continued.	Ọ gara n'ihu.
I like cooking better, you know.	Ọ ka m mma isi nri, ị mara.
The last thing we want is a crowd.	Ihe ikpeazụ anyị chọrọ bụ igwe mmadụ.
I have done nothing wrong.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọjọọ m mere.
My family is good.	Ezinụlọ m dị mma.
Things are not so simple.	Ihe adịghị mfe otú ahụ.
So maybe there is something in it.	Ya mere ma eleghị anya ọ dị ihe dị na ya.
I have enough books to get to the bookstore.	Enwere m akwụkwọ zuru oke iji nweta ụlọ ahịa akwụkwọ.
Then there is something else.	Mgbe ahụ, e nwere ihe ọzọ dị iche.
He is reasonable and happy.	Ọ na-enwe ezi uche na obi ụtọ.
The irony is that it was left there.	Ihe dị egwu bụ na a hapụrụ ya n'ebe ahụ.
I have no plans.	Enweghị m atụmatụ.
Or it could be anything.	Ma ọ bụ ọ pụrụ ịbụ ihe ọ bụla.
He had a good life.	O nwere ezigbo ndụ.
Because	N'ihi na
Finding in our child.	Ịchọta n'ime anyị nwa.
It was not successful.	Ọ bụghị ihe ịga nke ọma.
We do not have to take action.	Ọ dịghị anyị mkpa ime ihe na ya.
You said that this would not happen.	I kwuru na nke a agaghị eme.
He was sure of that.	O doro ya anya na nke ahụ.
Thank you so much !.	Daalụ nke ukwuu!.
The first page is good, but the others are not.	Ibe mbụ dị mma, mana ndị ọzọ adịghị.
I wish we had known him at the time.	Ọ dị m ka ya bụrụ na anyị maara ya n'oge ahụ.
The reason is simple, and more beautiful than that.	Ihe kpatara ya dị mfe, ma mara mma karịa nke ahụ.
That in itself would be difficult.	Nke ahụ n'onwe ya ga-esi ike.
They took only the fool's words for it.	Ha were naanị okwu onye nzuzu ahụ maka ya.
That was one time.	Nke ahụ bụ otu oge.
However, we are different in some important ways.	Otú ọ dị, anyị dị iche n'ụzọ ụfọdụ dị mkpa.
No, it can happen to anyone.	Mba, o nwere ike ime onye ọ bụla.
I know some words of this language.	Ama m okwu ụfọdụ nke asụsụ a.
Many things could have happened at that time.	Ọtụtụ ihe nwere ike ime n'oge ahụ.
If so, please let me know.	Ọ bụrụ otú ahụ, biko mee ka m mara.
In fact, it was there that he got his first.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ebe ahụ ka o nwetara nke mbụ ya.
This is my style.	Nke a bụ ụdị m.
But he said nothing to her.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ gwara ya.
You scared me.	Ị tụrụ m egwu.
No one else is alive.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ dị ndụ.
But here you are.	Ma ebe a ka ị nọ.
He was alone in the room at the time.	Ọ nọ naanị ya n'ime ụlọ n'oge ahụ.
However, the music itself is good.	Otú ọ dị, egwu n'onwe ya dị mma.
Their actions so far speak to this.	Omume ha ruo ugbu a na-ekwu maka nke a.
He went immediately.	Ọ gara ozugbo.
It's time, he knows.	Ọ bụ oge, ọ maara.
That is a special case.	Nke ahụ bụ ikpe pụrụ iche.
Every day is the same.	Ụbọchị ọ bụla bụ otu ihe ahụ.
As the ship ran into the harbor.	Ka ụgbọ mmiri na-agba ọsọ n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri.
All your friends are in town.	Ndị enyi gị niile nọ n'ime obodo.
I would like to be with my family.	Ọ ga-amasị m ka mụ na ezinụlọ m nọrọ.

Can't do that again.	Enweghị ike ime nke ahụ ọzọ.

To her surprise, the bag contained a pair of shoes.	N'ụzọ tụrụ ya n'anya, akpa ahụ nwere otu akpụkpọ ụkwụ.

Of course, they always happen.	N'ezie, ha na-eme mgbe niile.

Tomorrow will be better.	Echi ga-adị mma.

She wants to help.	Ọ chọrọ inye aka.
My uncle will not be happy.	Obi agaghị adị nwanne nna m mma.

No one else was there at the time.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ nọ n'ebe ahụ n'oge ahụ.
Many do not do it on their own.	Ọtụtụ anaghị eme ya n'onwe ha.

It is a practical requirement.	Ọ bụ ihe ndị bara uru chọrọ.
It's tough.	O siri ike.
It happened a long time ago.	O mere ogologo oge gara aga.

Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	O yikarịrị ka ọ bụ n'ihi oke mmadụ.
He is sitting next to the passengers.	Ọ nọ ọdụ n'akụkụ ndị njem.

That's not bad.	Nke ahụ adịghị njọ.
My father bought my mother, you see.	Nna m zụtara nne m, ị hụ.
He left his mother and told her where he was going.	Ọ hapụrụ nne ya, gwa ya ebe ọ na-aga.
He knows why he is doing this.	Ọ maara ihe mere o ji na-eme ihe a.
He knew that he had to be used to that.	Ọ maara na e kwesịrị iji nke ahụ mara ya ahụ́.
He wants your child.	Ọ chọrọ nwa gị.
I don't know what they are, but it speaks for itself.	Amaghị m ihe ha bụ, mana ọ na-ekwu okwu azụ.
Their small house.	Obere ụlọ ha.
But you should see it for yourself.	Ma i kwesịrị ịhụ ya n'onwe gị.
A doctor has your home there.	Otu onye dọkịta nwere ụlọ gị ebe ahụ.
And of course he was right.	Na n'ezie na o kwuru eziokwu.
I will not cry because of it.	Agaghị m akwa ákwá n'ihi ya.
But these two opportunities are expensive.	Ma ohere abụọ a dị oke ọnụ.
Well done, run with friends.	Ọ dị mma, na-agba ọsọ na ndị enyi.

It wasn’t what he wanted, but he would do it for then.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọ chọrọ, ma ọ ga-eme ya maka mgbe ahụ.
He quit his job well.	Ọ kwụsịrị ọrụ ya nke ọma.

Fire does the work we could have done otherwise.	Ọkụ na-arụ ọrụ ahụ anyị gaara arụ ma ọ bụghị ya.

This is sometimes ignorance.	Nke a bụ mgbe ụfọdụ amaghị ihe ọ bụla.
We do not know you.	Anyị amaghị gị.
He made a lot of money.	O nwetara nnukwu ego.
No fighting situation, obviously.	Enweghị ọnọdụ ọgụ, doro anya.
Some people do not like this dish.	Nri a adịghị amasị ụfọdụ.

The restaurant is on fire.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ na-agba ọkụ.

My hopes were dashed.	Olileanya m dara.
His mother seemed to think.	Nne ya ọ dị ka ọ na-eche .
That is very important.	Nke ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa.
We are a good team.	Anyị bụ ezigbo otu.

In the afternoon, he would not eat.	N'ehihie, ọ gaghị eri nri.
Dinner is a feast!	Nri abalị bụ oriri!
But it's beautiful, too.	Ma ọ mara mma, kwa.
Their view of truth is conditional.	Echiche ha banyere eziokwu bụ ọnọdụ.
Is that yours or your mother's?	Nke ahụ ọ bụ nke gị ka ọ bụ nke nne gị?
Will be able to.	Ga-enwe ike.

He is obviously superior to anyone else.	O doro anya na ọ karịrị onye ọ bụla ọzọ.

And they succeeded.	Ha wee nwee ihe ịga nke ọma.
He wanted me to tell him.	Ọ chọrọ ka m gwa ya.

Still, he told himself, that he was going to his successful business right now.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ gwara onwe ya, na ya na-aga ahịa nke ọma ya ugbu a.

Very few of them do.	Ọ dị nnọọ ole na ole n'ime ha na-eme ya.
Why did they do it?	Gịnị mere ha ji mee nke a?

Of course, this problem is not new.	N'ezie, nsogbu a abụghị nke ọhụrụ.

Anything will make it look smaller.	Ihe ọ bụla ga-eme ka ọ dị ka ọ dị obere.
I don't want anyone else.	Achọghị m onye ọzọ.
I saw a group of students.	Ahụrụ m otu ụmụ akwụkwọ.
Your idea is stupid.	Echiche gị bụ nzuzu.

The farther away, the worse.	N'ebe dị anya, ka njọ.
A loving teacher and student.	Otu onye nkuzi na nwa akwụkwọ hụrụ n'anya.
Or expect it, for that.	Ma ọ bụ tụrụ anya ya, maka nke ahụ.
Then to the other, but this time in the car.	Mgbe ahụ gaa na nke ọzọ, ma oge a na ụgbọ ala.
This is what is going to happen.	Nke a bụ ihe na-aga ime.
This is not really how he trades.	Nke a abụghị n'ezie ka ọ si azụ ahịa.

So, what do we do?	Ya mere, gịnị ka anyị ga-eme?
We need to call it.	Anyị kwesịrị ịkpọ ya.

Such behavior is expected.	A na-atụ anya omume dị otú ahụ.
A lot of things are going well, of course.	Ọtụtụ ihe na-aga nke ọma, n'ezie.
Otherwise, you may not work for me.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ị nwere ike ị gaghị arụ ọrụ m.

It's a journey.	Ọ bụ njem.
There are some shops nearby.	Enwere ụfọdụ ụlọ ahịa dị nso.
The idea should be familiar to him.	Echiche ahụ kwesịrị ịma ya ahụ́.
Now, they make it seem easy.	Ugbu a, ha mere ka ọ dị ka ọ dị mfe.

It’s all you want a woman to be.	Ọ bụ ihe niile ị chọrọ ka nwanyị bụrụ.
She knew exactly what to do with her father.	Ọ maara nnọọ ihe ọ ga-eme nna ya.
Most of us are not.	Ọtụtụ n'ime anyị abụghị.
Those words stayed.	Okwu ndị ahụ nọrọ.
Now this is the only thing you can do.	Ugbu a nke a bụ naanị ihe ị nwere ike ime.

Of course you can go to school.	N'ezie ị nwere ike ịga ụlọ akwụkwọ.
He left me there, to enjoy himself alone.	Ọ hapụrụ m ebe ahụ, iji mee onwe ya obi ụtọ naanị ya.

Of these, three were female and two were male.	N'ime ndị a, atọ bụ nwanyị na abụọ bụ nwoke.
It is perfect for us.	O zuru oke maka anyị.
That is obviously only good power.	Nke ahụ bụ doro anya na naanị ezi ike.
But this time, it will be different.	Ma n'oge a, ọ ga-adị iche.
A law was made.	E mere iwu.
They think that you want to give them this gift.	Ha chere na ị ga-achọ inye ha onyinye a.
Obviously something went wrong.	O doro anya na ọ nwere ihe adịghị mma.
It looks like the first one.	Ọ yiri nke mbụ.
That is for your judgment, not mine.	Nke ahụ bụ maka ikpe gị, ọ bụghị nke m.

That is for us.	Nke ahụ bụ maka anyị.
But not this woman.	Ma ọ bụghị nwanyị a.
Mine is not the same case.	Nke m abụghị otu ikpe.
Maybe tonight it will catch fire.	Ma eleghị anya, n'abalị a ọ ga-eme ọkụ.
It goes fast.	Ọ na-aga ngwa ngwa.
It’s just stupid, he doesn’t know.	Ọ bụ naanị nzuzu, ọ maghị.
I don't want another friend.	Achọghị m enyi ọzọ.
But no one really knows what will happen.	Ma, ọ dịghị onye maara ihe ga-eme.
They read history back.	Ha na-agụ akụkọ ihe mere eme azụ.
That is very important to me.	Nke ahụ dị m ezigbo mkpa.
Here is a way to think about it.	Nke a bụ ụzọ iche echiche banyere ya.
What you are saying now.	Ihe ị na-ekwu ugbu a.
He refused to talk about his childhood.	Ọ jụrụ ikwu banyere oge ọ bụ nwata.

Passengers are on every side.	Ndị njem nọ n'akụkụ ọ bụla.
One man.	Otu nwoke .
Or any event, of course.	Ma ọ bụ ihe omume ọ bụla, n'ezie.

This is a serious case.	Nke a bụ ikpe siri ike.
It can happen to anyone.	O nwere ike ime onye ọ bụla.
History is not on your side.	Akụkọ ihe mere eme adịghị n'akụkụ gị.
That is true for individuals.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu maka ndị mmadụ n'otu n'otu.
They can move on with their lives.	Ha nwere ike iji ndụ ha gaa n'ihu.
Ancient.	Oge ochie.
So it was tonight.	Ya mere, ọ bụ n'abalị a.
She wanted to help.	Ọ chọrọ inye aka.
This game takes place in two minutes.	Egwuregwu a na-eme na nkeji abụọ.
The price of the restaurant is reasonable.	Ọnụ ego ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ ahụ nwere ezi uche.

He could see his house in the distance.	O nwere ike ịhụ ụlọ ya n'ebe dị anya.
Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ha na-arụ ọrụ, mgbe ụfọdụ ha anaghị arụ ọrụ.
That can happen again very quickly.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ime ọzọ ngwa ngwa.
Take the woman there.	Kpọrọ nwanyị ahụ gaa ebe ahụ.
He did not know.	Ọ maghị.
In my bag.	N'ime akpa m.
We are not interested in that.	Anyị enweghị mmasị na nke ahụ.
This is the first time this has happened.	Nke a bụ nke mbụ ụdị ihe a mere.
Many argue that schools should be legal.	Ọtụtụ na-arụ ụka na ụlọ akwụkwọ kwesịrị ịbụ iwu.

I have been saying this for many years.	M na-ekwu ihe a kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
Coming in time here.	Na-abịa n'oge ebe a.
The question in this case is the same rule.	Ajụjụ dị na nke a bụ otu iwu.
One dead man is better than the other.	Otu nwoke nwụrụ anwụ dị mma karịa ha abụọ.
Which does not exist obviously.	Nke na-adịghị adị doro anya.
There is hope for everyone.	Enwere olileanya maka mmadụ niile.
From the news about the fire in the building.	Site na akụkọ gbasara ọkụ na ụlọ ahụ.
He knows how important this can be.	Ọ maara otú nke a pụrụ isi dị mkpa.
It goes on and on.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu.
It's just beautiful.	Ọ mara mma naanị.
There is a new person working in the hospital.	Enwere onye ọhụrụ na-arụ ọrụ n'ụlọ ọgwụ.

But nothing.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe.
Is the trip rough?	Njem ahụ ọ̀ siri ike?
Where is your medicine?	Ebee ka ọgwụ gị nọ?
The truth is that no one knows.	Eziokwu bụ na ọ dịghị onye maara.
He really liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
But this time, he knows he is reading his thoughts carefully.	Ma na nke ugbu a, ọ maara na ọ na-agụ nke ọma echiche ya.
I had never seen this before.	Ahụghị m nke a na mbụ.
Everyone was questioning him.	Onye ọ bụla nọ na-agba ya ajụjụ.
He sometimes received the letter from home.	O nwetara akwụkwọ ozi ahụ site n'ụlọ mgbe ụfọdụ.
Another thing is that.	N'ihe ọzọ bụ nke ahụ.
He did it again.	O mere ya ọzọ.
Food and family maximum.	Nri na ezinụlọ kacha.
Then there is only the light.	Mgbe ahụ enwere naanị ọkụ.
It looks really good.	Ọ mara ezigbo mma n'ezie.
They burned many places.	Ha gbara ọtụtụ ebe ọkụ.
This new application worked instantly.	Ngwa ọhụrụ a gara nke ọma ozugbo.
Life is incomparable.	Ndụ enweghị atụ.
How old was he then.	Afọ ole ka ọ dị mgbe ahụ.
We finally did our own thing.	Anyị mechara mee ihe nke anyị.
He liked the negative effects of his own.	Ọ masịrị ya mmetụta ọjọọ nke aka ya.
You are a good friend.	Ị bụ ezigbo enyi.
But not sometimes.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe ụfọdụ.

That is why they are children.	Ọ bụ ya mere ha ji bụrụ ụmụaka.

The girls were happy, of course.	Ụmụ agbọghọ ahụ nwere obi ụtọ, n'ezie.
There are a few people who enjoy swimming.	Enwere mmadụ ole na ole na-atọ ụtọ igwu mmiri.
He knows you are here.	Ọ ma na ị nọ ebe a.
I could not leave.	Apụghị m pụọ.
But they won't do that, either.	Mana ha agaghị eme nke ahụ, kwa.
Additional tests are required. 	Ekwesịrị ime ule ndị ọzọ. 
Men's.	ndị nwoke.
Or a temporary word.	Ma ọ bụ okwu nke nwa oge.
What appeals to many athletes is violence.	Ihe na-amasị ọtụtụ ndị egwuregwu bụ ime ihe ike.
I want to see the game.	Achọrọ m ịhụ egwuregwu ahụ.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
This house is expensive!	Ụlọ a dị oke ọnụ!
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ nweghị ihe gbasara nke ahụ.
It looks like he needs one.	Ọ dị ka ọ chọrọ otu.
Everything needs a different application.	Ihe ọ bụla chọrọ ngwa dị iche.
That is another fact.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọzọ o kwuru eziokwu.
In form.	Na ụdị.
I can be a good person.	Enwere m ike ịbụ ezigbo onye.
Now everything is working fine.	Ugbu a ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Again during that time.	Ọzọ n'ime oge ahụ.
But no one really knows, because the road is new.	Ma ọ dịghị onye maara n'ezie, n'ihi na ụzọ dị ọhụrụ.
They should not do this.	Ha ekwesịghị ime nke a.
Perhaps she was afraid to look inside.	Ma eleghị anya, ụjọ na-atụ ya ịhụ ihe dị n’ime ya.
But then fire.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọkụ.
Not many and not fast.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ na ọ bụghị ngwa ngwa.
He speaks fast.	Ọ na-ekwu ngwa ngwa.
Lack of jurisdiction.	Enweghị ikike nke ụlọ ikpe.
Bad days are what keep us strong.	Ụbọchị ọjọọ bụ ihe na-eme ka anyị dị ike.
That is one way to do it, if it is deemed necessary.	Nke ahụ bụ otu ụzọ isi mee ya, ma ọ bụrụ na e chere na ọ dị mkpa.
Not so.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
And of course, really big.	Ma ọ bụ n'ezie, n'ezie nnukwu.
Anger is strong.	Iwe iwe dị ike.
It sounds like a lot of fun.	Ọ dị ka ọtụtụ ihe ọchị.
I need to run.	m kwesịrị ịgba ọsọ.
At room temperature.	N'ụlọ okpomọkụ.

But that is not why people buy them.	Ma ọ bụghị ya mere ndị mmadụ ji azụ ha.
But that is not the point.	Ma, nke ahụ abụghị isi ihe.
She is wearing a very beautiful dress.	O yi uwe mara mma nke ukwuu.
The two are very similar.	Ihe abụọ ahụ yiri nnọọ.
He is looking for himself.	Ọ na-achọ onwe ya.
He goes there all the time.	Ọ na-aga ebe ahụ mgbe niile.
Otherwise, it will be fine.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ ga-adị mma.
Customer service is another important factor.	Ọrụ ndị ahịa ihe ọzọ dị mkpa.
He continued, as he always did.	Ọ gara n'ihu, dị ka ọ na-eme mgbe ọ bụla.
Everyone thought the same job.	Onye ọ bụla chere otu ọrụ ahụ.

Mine is very bad.	Nke m dị nnọọ njọ.

His parents didn’t think it would be so much.	Nne na nna ya echeghị na ọ ga-abụ nke ukwuu.
No such thing is necessary.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ dị mkpa.

It is different.	Ọ dị iche.
They have only a few customers.	Ha nwere naanị ndị ahịa ole na ole.
Often, they occur at an early age.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ha na-eme na nwata na nwata.
The moral strength is still strong.	Ike omume ka siri ike.

No one stopped him on his journey.	Ọ dịghị onye kwụsịrị ya na njem ya.
We were very happy there to love our friends.	Anyị nwere nnọọ obi ụtọ n'ebe ahụ na anyị hụrụ ndị enyi anyị n'anya.

Everything is fresh and fun.	Ihe niile dị ọhụrụ ma na-atọ ụtọ.
Illness and malice.	Ọrịa na ihe ọjọọ.

The first is the speed towards the bar.	Nke mbụ bụ ọsọ ọsọ na-aga n'ebe mmanya.
But some of them do.	Ma ụfọdụ n’ime ha na-eme ya.

And into music.	Na n'ime egwu.
It's not hard.	Ọ bụghị ike.
Just once more.	Naanị otu ugboro ọzọ.

For a long time.	Ruo ogologo oge.
She goes to school every morning and night.	Ọ na-aga akwụkwọ kwa ụtụtụ na abalị.
The house was surrounded by trees.	Osisi gbara ụlọ ahụ gburugburu.
But it's a big meeting.	Ma ọ bụ nnukwu nzukọ.

We will do something now.	Anyị ga-eme ihe ugbu a.
I am not a beautiful child in a beautiful crowd.	Abụghị m nwa mara mma n'ime igwe mmadụ mara mma.
His story is long.	Akụkọ ya dị ogologo.
You can’t fire in ten waters, not at the same time.	Ị nweghị ike ọkụ na mmiri iri, ọ bụghị n'otu oge ahụ.
I thought the story, but nothing came of it.	Echere m akụkọ ahụ, mana ọ nweghị ihe bịara.
But it is still something.	Ma ọ ka bụ ihe.
No one knows why.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ihe kpatara ya.
He seems to be alone with this idea.	Ọ dị ka ọ nọ naanị ya na echiche a.
The project seemed to be successful.	Ọrụ ahụ yiri ka ọ gara nke ọma.
They arrived at the house.	Ha rutere n'ụlọ ahụ.

This is how it goes.	Nke a bụ ka ọ na-aga.
Anything can be food.	Ihe ọ bụla nwere ike ịbụ nri.

The city needs good transportation, he says.	Obodo a chọrọ njem njem nke ọma, ka ọ na-ekwu.
It is a bad idea.	Ọ bụ echiche ọjọọ.
The law gives the right to speak.	Iwu nyere ikike ikwu okwu.
So he thought.	Ya mere o chere.
But it was an awesome car.	Mana ọ bụ ụgbọ ala dị egwu.
I don't think so.	Echeghị m ya otú ahụ.
You are not mine.	Ị bụghị nke m.
The group is very scared.	Ndị otu a gbara ezigbo egwu.
There is no need to be angry.	Ọ dịghị mkpa iwe iwe.
No doubt you care about what you do.	O doro anya na ị nwere mmasị maka ihe ị na-eme.
But the body did things on its own.	Ma ahụ ya mere ihe n'onwe ya.
He is not alone in his room.	Naanị ya anọghị n'ime ụlọ ya.
Home or office, it doesn’t matter.	Ụlọ ma ọ bụ ụlọ ọrụ, ọ dịghị mkpa.

This is the happiest day of my life.	Nke a bụ ụbọchị kacha atọ m ụtọ ná ndụ m.

He died for them, my husband.	Ọ nwụrụ maka ha, di m.

Most of all, do you enjoy what you do?	Nke ka nke, ihe ị na-eme ọ na-atọ gị ụtọ?
He left her.	Ọ hapụrụ ya.

The disease is incurable.	Ọrịa na-enweghị atụ.
So they do it again and again.	Ya mere, ha na-eme ya ugboro ugboro.
There are two main differences.	E nwere isi ihe abụọ dị iche.
Today is one of those days.	Taa bụ otu n'ime ụbọchị ndị ahụ.
No one is new.	Ọ dịghị onye bụ onye ọhụrụ.
Many people came near.	Ọtụtụ ndị bịara nso.
But home ,.	Ma ụlọ,.
Most of it is space.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ya bụ ohere.
No one talks about it anymore.	Ọ dịghị onye na-ekwu maka ya ọzọ.
This should tell us something.	Nke a kwesịrị ịgwa anyị ihe.
The girl was angry.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ were iwe.
And they go.	Na ha na-aga.
You have to be the boss.	Ị ga-abụ onye isi.
And my father is the same.	Na nna m bụ otu.
Which is nice.	Nke dị mma.
Bad.	Ihe ọjọọ.
He needed a job abroad.	Ọ chọrọ ọrụ ná mba ọzọ.
Something important happens to everyone.	Ihe dị mkpa na-eme onye ọ bụla.
They are there.	Ha nọ ebe ahụ.
Your mother is as beautiful as ever.	Nne gị mara mma dị ka mgbe ọ bụla.
We talk, but nothing happens.	Anyị na-ekwu okwu, ma ọ dịghị ihe na-eme.
The food is awesome.	Nri dị egwu.
All that matters is that you have it.	Ihe niile dị mkpa bụ na ị nwere ya.
Such questions frightened me.	Ajụjụ ndị dị otú a tụrụ m ụjọ.
This has its own problems.	Nke a nwere nsogbu nke ya.
He is still in danger.	Ọ ka nọ n'ihe egwu.
It seems to be from another time.	Ọ dị ka ọ si n'oge ọzọ.
Stop doing that.	Kwụsị ime nke ahụ.
He has just left this water for us.	Ọ ka hapụrụ anyị mmiri a.
I do it over and over again.	Ana m eme ya ugboro ugboro.
I do not understand why he would say no.	Aghọtaghị m ihe mere ọ ga-eji sị mba.
It is far worse than we left.	Ọ dị nnọọ njọ karịa ka anyị hapụrụ.
It is a room.	Ọ bụ ọnụ ụlọ.
This is an idea.	Nke a bụ echiche.
It can be too big.	O nwere ike ibu ya oke ibu.
I would have expected this to go down.	M gaara atụ anya na nke a ga-aga na ala.
That should not happen.	Nke ahụ ekwesịghị ime.
They really took it.	Ha were ya n'ezie.
I think there is one small problem.	Echere m na enwere otu obere nsogbu.
Just to make me feel better, he said.	Naanị iji mee ka m dị mma, o kwuru.
We have three children.	Anyị nwere ụmụaka atọ.
His power is beyond our reach.	Ike ya karịrị anyị ike.
I did this.	M mere ihe a.
Continue to work on my body.	Gaa n'ihu na-arụ ọrụ na ahụ m.
It is me for my own actions.	Ọ bụ m maka omume nke m.
I think it could be both.	Echere m na ọ nwere ike ịbụ ha abụọ.
I like it.	Ọ masịrị m n'anya.
We need to do this over and over again.	Anyị kwesịrị ime nke a ugboro ugboro.
But this is not the point here.	Mana nke a abụghị isi ebe a.
This was our first day in the country.	Nke a bụ ụbọchị mbụ anyị nọrọ ná mba ahụ.
Each one is different.	Onye ọ bụla n'ime ha dị iche.
Out of service.	Ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
Tears welled up in her eyes.	Anya mmiri gbara ya n'anya.
There is a moment of fear.	Enwere obere oge ụjọ.
These leaders have an important interest.	Ndị isi ndị a nwere mmasị dị mkpa.
Maybe it’s not just money.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị naanị ego.
That comes with being human.	Nke ahụ na-abịa na ịbụ mmadụ.
That is what the law requires.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe iwu chọrọ.
This is so much fun.	Nke a bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
He is with them.	Ya na ha nọ.
But that is not the way things work.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka ihe si arụ ọrụ.
That's when the plan came to his mind.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka atụmatụ malitere n’obi ya.
Cook for a few minutes or until hot.	Esi nri maka nkeji ole na ole ma ọ bụ ruo mgbe ọ dị ọkụ.
I don’t want that day to end.	Achọghị m ka ụbọchị ahụ kwụsị.
It is better.	Ọ ka ya mma.
Is something wrong?	Ọ nwere ihe na-eme?
The conditions were not good.	Ọnọdụ ndị ahụ adịghị mma.
Thanks, there is a way.	Daalụ, enwere ụzọ.
This makes it worse.	Nke a na-eme ka ọ ka njọ.
What a good idea.	Kedu ezi echiche.
And my brother.	Na nwanne m nwoke.
It's tough.	O siri ike.
These can be awesome.	Ndị a nwere ike ịdị egwu.
Many of those things go hand in hand.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ihe ndị ahụ na-aga aka.
However, that is not the only problem.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ abụghị naanị nsogbu.
This photo is in a friend's house.	Foto a dị n'ụlọ enyi.
It's too strong.	O siri ike nke ukwuu.
It is then now.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ugbu a.
These trees are unique.	Osisi ndị a pụrụ iche.
I don’t know if you can do this.	Amaghị m na ị nwere ike ime nke a.
More people read newspapers than do newspapers now.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-agụ akwụkwọ akụkọ karịa akwụkwọ akụkọ ugbu a.
They are really going for it.	Ha na-aga n'ezie maka ya.
It's just that he likes to have big money.	Ọ bụ naanị na ọ na-amasị ya inwe nnukwu ego.
What time is it now?	Kedu oge ugbu a?
It surprised me.	Ọ tụrụ m n'anya.
It will not be that person.	Ọ gaghị abụ onye ahụ.
He was considered inactive.	E lere ya anya dị ka onye na-adịghị arụ ọrụ.
But he stopped when we reached the door.	Ma ọ kwụsịrị ka anyị rutere n'ọnụ ụzọ.
His style is bold but awesome.	Ụdị ya nwere obi ike mana ọ dị egwu.
We are one year old.	Anyị gbara otu afọ.
Good for my back.	Mma maka azụ m.
Just my chance.	Naanị ohere m.
A couple of weeks probably.	A di na nwunye nke izu eleghị anya.
But the price and value is huge.	Ma ọnụ ahịa na ọnụ ahịa dị ukwuu.
Four, in the car.	Anọ, n'ime ụgbọ ala.
But this is not the way it should be.	Ma nke a abụghị otú o kwesịrị ịdị.
Of course, there is a little water.	N'ezie, ọ dị ntakịrị mmiri.
Here the law is clear.	N'ebe a iwu doro anya.
Certainly not when he is acting.	O doro anya na ọ bụghị mgbe ọ na-eme ihe.
It's an easy task.	Ọ bụ ọrụ dị mfe.
They are popular.	Ha bụ ndị a ma ama.
The interview soon ended.	Ajụjụ ọnụ ahụ kwụsịrị n'oge na-adịghị anya.
My family knows that.	Ezinụlọ m maara nke ahụ.
Next to my mother.	N'akụkụ nne m.
He was doing it alone.	Ọ nọ naanị ya na-eme ihe ya.
I looked at them.	M lere anya n’ihu ha.
That they have a lot of power and need help.	Na ha nwere ọtụtụ ikike ma chọọ enyemaka.
This time it comes.	Oge a ọ na-abịa.
For one reason or another.	N'ihi otu ihe kpatara ya.
As the doctor would do.	Dị ka dọkịta ga-eme.
Fast.	Ngwa ngwa.
It looks like this picture.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị na foto a.
About ten months, then.	Ihe dị ka ọnwa iri, mgbe ahụ.
Whatever it is, everything happens the same way.	N'agbanyeghị ihe ọ bụ, ihe ọ bụla na-eme n'otu ụzọ ahụ.
It was nice to see them together.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ ha ọnụ.
We are in the land here.	Anyị nọ n'ime ala ebe a.
The first seat is limited.	Nọdụ ala mbụ nwere oke.
And enjoy it.	Ma nwee mmasị na ya.
We are sure it is the worst.	Anyị ji n'aka na ọ bụ nke kacha njọ.
It took him a few hours.	O were ya awa ole na ole.
I want to do it tonight.	Achọrọ m ime ya n'abalị a.
Whatever the case may be.	Ihe ọ bụla ikpe nwere ike ịbụ.
He wanted to tell them.	Ọ chọrọ ịgwa ha.
This building has many uses.	Ụlọ a nwere ọtụtụ ihe eji eme ihe.
He never talks about his grandfather or school or anything.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-ekwu banyere nna nna ya ma ọ bụ ụlọ akwụkwọ ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
And others come to the hospital.	Na ndị ọzọ na-abịa n'ụlọ ọgwụ.
You will need different colors.	Ị ga-achọ ụdị agba dị iche iche.
They try to get me to help them.	Ha na-agbalị ịgwa m ka m nyere ha aka.
He tried again, several times, every time without feeling.	Ọ gbalịrị ọzọ, ọtụtụ ugboro, oge ọ bụla na-enweghị mmetụta.
I left him there for several weeks.	M hapụrụ ya ebe ahụ ọtụtụ izu.
It’s not a bad job as work goes on.	Ọ bụghị ọrụ dị njọ ka ọrụ na-aga.
I want to know if it will work well.	M na-achọ ịma ma ọ ga-eme nke ọma.
Not himself.	Ọ bụghị ya onwe ya.
Need is important.	Mkpa bụ mkpa.
Man is different.	Nwoke dị iche.
Here are some books, really.	Nke a bụ ụfọdụ akwụkwọ, ezigbo.
Never.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bụla.
Not too excited about it.	Ọ bụghị oke obi ụtọ banyere ya.
I am sure you have a strong feeling for him.	O doro m anya na ị nwere mmetụta siri ike n'ebe ọ nọ.
We can't do that.	Anyị enweghị ike ime nke ahụ.
Here are two.	Nke a bụ abụọ.
The stock has fallen sharply this year.	Ahịa ahụ dara nke ukwuu n'afọ a.
They understand what is happening in the country.	Ha ghọtara ihe na-eme ná mba ahụ.
That should be the case.	Otú ahụ ka ọ kwesịrị ịdị.
There is no reason to doubt that.	Enweghị ihe mere ị ga-eji nwee obi abụọ na nke ahụ.
Take you to a restaurant.	Were gị gaa n'ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
I know him personally.	M mara ya n’onwe ya.
They entered the big room.	Ha banyere n'ime nnukwu ọnụ ụlọ ahụ.
Anyone can see that.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ike ịhụ nke ahụ.
But this time it is different.	Ma na nke ugbu a, ọ dị iche.
He may be the only one who likes it.	O nwere ike ịbụ naanị ya ga-amasị ya.
The movie will be awesome.	Ihe nkiri ahụ ga-adị egwu.
Just tell me what you want.	Naanị gwa m nke ị chọrọ.
The trip took two weeks.	Njem ahụ were izu abụọ.
He told me he could help.	Ọ gwara m na ya nwere ike inye aka.
We are still an ongoing project.	Anyị ka bụ ọrụ na-aga n'ihu.
Let me see that.	Ka m hụ nke ahụ.
Running around a church or thing.	Na-agba ọsọ gburugburu ụka ma ọ bụ ihe.
We look forward to hearing from you !.	Anyị na-atụ anya okwu gị!.
someone asked.	mmadụ jụrụ.
It's just a joke.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe ọchị.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
But of course, all music books will do just that.	Mana n'ezie, akwụkwọ egwu egwu niile ga-eme nke ahụ.
One is good, one is not.	Otu onye dị mma, otu onye adịghị.
They say what we say now.	Ha na-ekwu ihe anyị na-ekwu ugbu a.
No it is not.	Mba ọ bụghị.
Congratulations to us, they did.	Obi ụtọ maka anyị, ha mere.
But none of us know much.	Ma ọ dịghị nke anyị maara obere.
It was his eyes.	Ọ bụ anya ya.
The reason for this is simple.	Ihe kpatara nke a dị mfe.
Nothing and no one.	Ọ dịghị ihe na ọ dịghị onye.
At one point he was making her breakfast.	N'otu oge ọ na-eme ya nri ụtụtụ.
We thought of them as men.	Anyị chere na ha dị ka ụmụ nwoke.
Two years without a friend.	Afọ abụọ nke enweghị otu enyi.
I was thinking about you this morning.	Anọ m na-eche banyere gị n'ụtụtụ a.
He soon lost confidence in his own career.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, ọ kwụsịrị inwe obi ike n'ọrụ nke ya.
For now, we will move on.	Maka ugbu a, anyị ga-aga n'ihu.
What a great job.	Kedu nnukwu ọrụ.
There is not much to do about this problem.	Enweghị ọtụtụ ihe a ga-eme maka nsogbu a.
We are like prisoners.	Anyị dị ka ndị eji eji.
A city is a place where people live.	Obodo bụ ebe nwere ụlọ ndị mmadụ bi.
It's a beautiful thing.	Ọ bụ ihe mara mma.
With your parents, you want to be both near and far.	Gị na ndị mụrụ gị, ị chọrọ ma ịdị nso ma dị anya.
Thanks for that.	Daalụ maka nke ahụ.
They can do this in four ways.	Ha nwere ike ime nke a n'ụzọ anọ.
He is not doing well right now.	Ọ naghị eme ihe ọma ugbu a.
There he was.	N'ebe ahụ ka ọ nọ.
The children were terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ ụmụaka.
It seems like a lot of people.	Ọ dị ka ọtụtụ ndị otú ahụ.
There is something wrong.	Ọ nwere ihe adịghị mma.
Probably never.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dịghị mgbe anyị ga-eme.
The drug is expensive.	Ọgwụ ahụ dị oke ọnụ.
Wait, you can do that now.	Chere, ị nwere ike ime nke ahụ ugbu a.
There is no doubt in my mind.	Enweghị obi abụọ n'obi m.
I would like it.	Aga m achọ ya.
A popular story.	Akụkọ a ma ama.
The head of pork is the same for everyone.	Isi nke anụ ezi bụ otu maka mmadụ ọ bụla.
However, there is more.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ihe ọzọ.
It was bad then and it is bad now.	Ọ dị njọ mgbe ahụ ma ọ dị njọ ugbu a.
I have good reason to do so.	O nwere ihe mere m ji mee otú ahụ.
Such machines work well.	Igwe ndị dị otú ahụ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
It made him feel worthless.	O mere ka ọ ghara inwe mmetụta na-enweghị isi.
Nothing special about that.	Ọ dịghị ihe pụrụ iche banyere.
The group continued to travel.	Ndị otu ahụ gara n'ihu na-eme njem.
That is what you should do.	Nke ahụ bụ ka ị mee.
What he is trying to do.	Ihe ọ na-agbalị ime.
Not all leaders are well-educated.	Ọ bụghị ndị isi niile bụ ndị a mụrụ nke ọma.
This worked well.	Nke a gara nke ọma.
Attitude, behavior, behavior.	Omume, omume, omume.
But it is not clear to me.	Ma ọ bụghị ihe doro m anya.
I wonder if he is hungry.	M na-eche ma agụụ na-agụ ya.
He was always violent.	Ọ bụ mgbe niile na-eme ihe ike.
I love you, no matter what.	Ahụrụ m gị n'anya, n'agbanyeghị ihe ọ bụla.
He kind of thought, of course he did.	O mere ụdị echiche, n'ezie ọ mere.
They act despite the rules.	Ha na-eme ihe n'agbanyeghị iwu.
That is why he stopped.	Ọ bụ ya mere o ji kwụsị.
Lots of plans, lots of hope for today.	Ọtụtụ atụmatụ, ọtụtụ olileanya maka taa.
That makes the message easier and cheaper.	Nke ahụ na-eme ka ozi ahụ dị mfe ma dị ọnụ ala.
That is the point.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe.
Only man can make man.	Naanị mmadụ nwere ike ime mmadụ.
His heart did not.	Obi ya emeghị.
I do not love him.	Ahụghị m ya n'anya.
Men in bed linen.	Ụmụ nwoke na akwa akwa.
She is scared, but not in a cowardly way.	Ọ na-atụ ụjọ, ma ọ bụghị n'ụzọ ụjọ.
They really work.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ n'ezie.
Of course you know.	N'ezie, ị maara.
You want to have good skin.	Ị chọrọ inwe ezigbo akpụkpọ.
Tell him to expect one.	Gwa ya ka ọ tụrụ anya otu.
This is what it means to be a father.	Nke a bụ ihe ịbụ nna.
But then we bought our big old house.	Ma mgbe ahụ ka anyị zụtara nnukwu ụlọ ochie anyị.
We swam next to each other for a while.	Anyị na-egwu mmiri n'akụkụ ibe anyị nwa oge.
Which is kind of for history.	Nke bụ ụdị maka akụkọ ihe mere eme.
Some people go.	Ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ na-aga.
There were no screams or shouts.	Enweghị mkpu ákwá ma ọ bụ mkpu.
Tears welled up.	Anya mmiri juru ihu.
Everyone made a game.	Onye ọ bụla mere egwuregwu.
Both parents are doctors.	Ndị mụrụ ha abụọ bụ ndị dọkịta.
That is nothing new.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe ọhụrụ.
Four of these types are the same.	Anọ n'ime ụdị ndị a bụ otu.
I wouldn’t have it any other way.	Agaghị m enwe ya n'ụzọ ọ bụla ọzọ.
When he and his friend left.	Mgbe ya na enyi ya hapụrụ.
Beautiful, simple, long life.	Mma, mfe, ogologo ndụ.
Most do not take it for granted.	Ihe ka ọtụtụ abụghị ka e were dị ka eziokwu.
The second is similar, it's just easier.	Nke abụọ yiri ya, ọ bụ naanị mfe.
He is very happy.	Obi dị ya ụtọ nke ukwuu.
It's a matter of water.	Ọ bụ ihe nke mmiri.
Anyone can see each other.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ike ịhụ onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
This week, there will be a lot of questions.	N'izu a, a ga-enwe ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
I love the same music.	Ahụrụ m otu egwu ahụ n'anya.
No, we can not help you.	Mba, anyị enweghị ike inyere gị aka.
This city has a great population.	Obodo a nwere nnukwu mmadụ.
Truth is the way to go.	Eziokwu bụ ụzọ ebe a kwesịrị isi.
He makes movies.	Ọ na-eme ihe nkiri.
He stayed at work for a few hours.	Ọ nọrọ n'ụlọ ọrụ awa ole na ole.
Just in case you didn’t know, it’s not.	Naanị bụrụ na ị maghị, ọ bụghị.
Women do not recommend anything ,.	Ụmụ nwanyị anaghị atụ aro ihe,.
The doors are many.	Ọnụ ụzọ dị ọtụtụ.
It was a special time.	Ọ bụ oge pụrụ iche.

She was glad she knew it.	Ọ masịrị ya na ọ ma ya.
Either way make the trip.	Ọ bụla ụzọ mee njem ahụ.
He spoke to them.	Ọ gwara ha okwu.
We waited several minutes.	Anyị chere ọtụtụ nkeji.
In this case the difference is not.	Na nke a ikpe adịghị iche.
I have a problem.	Enwere m nsogbu.
No one saw it.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya.
But that is different.	Ma nke ahụ dị iche.
It doesn't matter.	Ọ nweghị ihe ọ mere.
Everything happened so fast.	Ihe niile mere ngwa ngwa.
The owner.	Onye nwere ya.
We can call it beautiful.	Anyị nwere ike ịkpọ ya ihe mara mma.
He has no big money.	O nweghị nnukwu ego.
That is the only important thing.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị ihe dị mkpa.
I am not good at this.	Adịghị m mma na nke a.
There is no money there.	Enweghị ego ebe ahụ.
I do not want.	Achọghị m.
The other family does not have that.	Ezinụlọ nke ọzọ enweghị nke ahụ.
All they do is make them visible to others.	Ihe niile ha na-eme bụ ka ndị mmadụ hụ ha.
The new job is a different story.	Ọrụ ọhụrụ bụ akụkọ dị iche.
Anger with her parents.	Iwe na ndị mụrụ ya.
Because I never questioned it.	N'ihi na ọ dịghị mgbe ajụjụ m.
He can use them to make shoes.	Ọ nwere ike iji ha mee akpụkpọ ụkwụ.
Women were not allowed to attend this church.	A naghị ekwe ka ụmụ nwanyị gaa ụka a.
That should have happened many years ago.	Nke ahụ kwesịrị ime ọtụtụ afọ gara aga.
Better than that.	Dị mma karịa nke a.
I saw this story this morning.	Ahụrụ m akụkọ a n'ụtụtụ a.
This river is well known.	A maara osimiri a nke ọma.
There is nothing you can do about it.	O nweghị ihe ị ga-eme.
Suddenly, she wanted to tell him everything.	Na mberede, ọ masịrị ya ịgwa ya ihe niile.
The weather is terrible.	Ihu igwe dị oke egwu.
You care about nothing but your food.	Ị na-eche banyere ihe ọ bụla ma nri gị.
We have no fear.	Anyị enweghị egwu.
An essential ingredient for any good meal is food.	Ihe dị mkpa maka oriri ọ bụla dị mma bụ nri nri.
The weather is not expected.	A naghị atụ anya ihu igwe.
Everything is stupid.	Ihe niile bụ ihe nzuzu.
I am not alone.	Ọ bụghị naanị m.
The film left the city yesterday.	Ihe nkiri ahụ hapụrụ obodo ụnyahụ.
I want to be that kind.	Achọrọ m ịbụ ụdị ahụ.
That was a bad time.	Oge ahụ bụ oge ọjọọ.
You are clearly.	Ị nọ n'ụzọ doro anya.
He has a strong face.	O nwere ihu siri ike.
There is no human right.	Enweghị ikike mmadụ.
I do not want to be anywhere else.	Achọghị m ịnọ ebe ọzọ.
I think he speaks as he does.	Echere m na ọ na-ekwu dị ka ọ dị.
The flight arrived within an hour.	Ụgbọ elu ahụ rutere n'ime otu awa.
His power is real.	Ike ya bụ n'ezie.
We do not want to talk about that.	Anyị achọghị ikwu banyere nke ahụ.
They are all male.	Ha niile bụ nwoke.
Water is very valuable in industry.	Mmiri bara ezigbo uru na ụlọ ọrụ.
Happy Holidays to you!	Ezi ezumike nye gị!
With the girl.	Mụ na nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
Her parents were shocked to learn that she was pregnant.	O juru ndị mụrụ ya anya ịhụ na ọ dị ime.
They asked a reporter about the matter.	Ha jụrụ onye nta akụkọ gbasara okwu a.
The day of power is over.	Ụbọchị ike kwụsịrị.
But it's just a boy.	Ma ọ bụ naanị nwa nwoke.
That’s pretty much it.	Nke ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
He goes on and on and on with them.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu ma na-aga n'ihu na ha.
He told them to stay the night.	Ọ gwara ha ka ha nọrọ n’abalị ahụ ọkụ.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
None of the patients suffered serious complications.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ndị ọrịa ahụ nwetara nnukwu nsogbu.
Next month, they will need something else.	N'ọnwa na-abịa, ha ga-achọ ihe ọzọ.
Come on, people.	Bịa, ndị mmadụ.
You get the idea.	Ị nweta echiche ahụ.
It has limits.	O nwere oke.
There are three possibilities for this.	E nwere ihe atọ nwere ike ime nke a.
But then it is true.	Ma mgbe ahụ bụ eziokwu.
It is expected to be done next year.	A na-atụ anya na a ga-eme ya n'afọ na-abịa.
They do.	Ha na-eme otú ahụ.
Make a photo of yourself.	Mee foto nke gị.
Nothing like that happened.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ mere.
I do that sometimes, saying a lot.	M na-eme nke ahụ mgbe ụfọdụ, na-ekwu ọtụtụ okwu.
We understand that you need help with your problem right now.	Anyị ghọtara na ị chọrọ enyemaka maka nsogbu gị ugbu a.
That is not what you want to do in this case.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe ị chọrọ ime na nke a.
That happened again and again.	Nke ahụ mere ugboro ugboro.
I do not know what is really happening to me.	Amaghị m ihe na-eme m n'ezie.
He suggested giving the president more authority.	Ọ tụrụ aro ka e nye onye isi ala ikike ka ukwuu.
So it took a chance.	Ya mere o were ohere.

It is a place away from the side.	Ọ bụ ebe pụọ n'akụkụ.
But it does happen.	Ma ọ na-eme n'ezie.
It looks like another test.	Ọ dị ka ọ bụ ule ọzọ.
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ agaghị eme.

Do you have the medicine?	Ị nwere ọgwụ ahụ?
He feels like a big man.	Ọ dị ya ka nnukwu mmadụ.
They talk about their day.	Ha na-ekwu banyere ụbọchị ha.
Of course, we cannot.	N'ezie, anyị enweghị ike.

This is what they are trying to do.	Nke a ka ha na-agbalị ime.

The messenger immediately rejected the plan.	Onye ozi ahụ jụrụ ozugbo atụmatụ ahụ.
That is the advantage of being in one.	Nke ahụ bụ otu uru ịnọ na otu.
I do not want to go anywhere.	Achọghị m ịga ebe ọ bụla.
You are on such teachings.	Ị nọ na nkuzi ndị dị otú ahụ.

I told him not to think so.	Agwara m ya ka ọ ghara iche echiche ime otú ahụ.

I did not see what he would be happy about.	Ahụghị m ihe ọ ga-enwe obi ụtọ.

It is longer than the first.	Ọ dị ogologo karịa nke mbụ.

The drink was very sweet for its taste.	Ihe ọṅụṅụ ahụ dị ụtọ nke ukwuu maka mmasị ya.
They were amazed at what they saw.	Ihe ha hụrụ tụrụ ha n’anya.
He did not want to talk about his test.	Ọ chọghị ikwu maka ule ya.
They have it coming, of course. 	Ha nwere ọ na-abịa, n'ezie.

No movie was made.	Ọ dịghị ihe e mere ihe nkiri.
They want to know their legal rights.	Ha chọrọ ịma ikike iwu obodo nyere ha.

He is not happy.	Obi adịghị ya ụtọ.
He believed.	O kwere ekwe.
You will not know our names or see our faces.	Ị gaghị ama aha anyị ma ọ bụ hụ ihu anyị.
That really is.	Nke ahụ n'ezie.
I still enjoy everything.	Ihe niile ka na-atọ m ụtọ.
They are all beautiful, after all.	Ha niile mara mma, mgbe niile.
I have nothing against it.	Enweghị m ihe ọjọọ na ya.
He asked her why she was not with him.	Ọ jụrụ ya ihe mere na gị na ya anọghị.
With that said.	Na nke ahụ kwuru.
It's tough.	O siri ike.
Or you feel a sense of urgency.	Ma ọ bụ ị na-enwe mmetụta ọsọ ọsọ.
It may not be pleasant.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị adị ya mma.
It's perfect, he said.	O zuru oke, o kwuru.
Your grandfather is the same.	Nna nna gị bụ otu ihe ahụ.
There are those who want to live.	O nwere ndị na-achọ ịnya ndụ.
But no doubt there was someone in the house.	Ma o doro anya na e nwere onye nọ n'ụlọ ahụ.
He knocked on the door.	Ọ tụrụ aka n'ọnụ ụzọ.
Thank you for giving me and others like me a chance.	Daalụ maka inye m na ndị ọzọ dị ka m ohere.
Some journalists were horrified by what they saw.	Ihe ha hụrụ tụrụ ụfọdụ ndị nta akụkọ egwu.
That is simple.	Nke ahụ dị mfe.
But we have some ideas.	Mana anyị nwere echiche ụfọdụ.
I know that for a fact.	Amaara m nke ahụ n'ezie.
The fish can be cooked in different ways.	Enwere ike esi nri azụ ahụ n'ụzọ dị iche iche.
Everything is possible.	Ihe niile na-eme omume.
This bed is very fresh.	Akwa a dị ezigbo ọhụrụ.
It stopped suddenly.	Ọ kwụsịrị na mberede.
We need to know what is going on around us.	Anyị kwesịrị ịma ihe ndị gbara anyị gburugburu.
Maybe he thought.	Ma eleghị anya, o chere.
And eggs.	Na akwa.
This story started just a few hours ago.	Akụkọ a malitere naanị awa ole na ole gara aga.
You can say in her heart.	I nwere ike ikwu n'obi ya.
That is very different.	Nke ahụ dị nnọọ iche.
I am a child, I have no friends.	Abụ m otu nwa, enweghị m otu enyi.
That was a fun time.	Oge ahụ bụ oge na-atọ ọchị.
She never asked him.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ jụrụ ya.
There is good news and bad news.	Enwere ozi ọma na akụkọ ọjọọ.
For better or worse, this is where it comes from.	Maka mma ma ọ bụ njọ, ebe a bụ ebe o si bịa.
It is a one-year course.	Ọ bụ nkuzi otu afọ.
I was only three days old.	Anọ m ebe ahụ naanị ụbọchị atọ.
But he could not.	Ma o nweghị ike.

Take this letter with you.	Were akwụkwọ ozi a na gị.
They can see me.	Ha nwere ike ịhụ m.
His wife went on a mission.	Nwunye ya gara ozi ntakịrị.
Not as much as any of it matters.	Ọ bụghị dị ka nke ọ bụla n'ime ya dị mkpa.
It is important to be able to travel long distances.	Ọ dị mkpa inwe ike ịga ogologo ebe dị anya.
She ate her coffee.	Ọ riri kọfị ya.
Because it is a lie indeed.	N'ihi na ọ bụ ụgha n'ezie.
You have a gift there, boy.	Ị nwere onyinye ebe ahụ, nwa nwoke.
Everyone is working to find a better way of life.	Onye ọ bụla na-arụ ọrụ iji nweta ụzọ ndụ ka mma.
I am well ahead.	Enwere m nke ọma n'ihu.
Drink plenty of water every day.	Na-aṅụ ọtụtụ mmiri kwa ụbọchị.
If they don’t, this could be a threat.	Ọ bụrụ na ha emeghị, nke a nwere ike ịbụ otu egwu.
She is ready to leave.	Ọ dị njikere ịpụ.
Airport facilities are not necessary.	Ihe ọdụ ụgbọ elu adịghị mkpa.
That’s just about me.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị ihe gbasara m.
The brand name is different, you know.	Ụdị aha dị iche, ị maara.
However, one person was not there.	Otú ọ dị, otu onye anọghị ya.
I'm glad we didn't.	Obi dị m ụtọ na anyị emeghị ya.
Quickly, he went to other parts of the store.	Ngwa ngwa, ọ gara n'akụkụ ndị ọzọ nke ụlọ ahịa ahụ.
No one eats.	Ọ dịghị onye na-eri nri.
These two types were originally thought to be different types.	Ụdị abụọ a e chere na mbụ dị ka ụdị dị iche iche.

It still works.	Ọ ka na-arụ ọrụ.
He knew exactly what he was talking about.	Ọ maara nke ọma ihe ọ na-ekwu.
There is no forgiveness.	Enweghị mgbaghara.
That just made it so beautiful.	Na dị nnọọ mere ka mara mma nke ukwuu.
I never thought about it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chere banyere ya.
Everything is going well.	Ihe niile na-aga nke ọma.
You can see the first one here.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ nke mbụ ebe a.
I do not want you to go.	Achọghị m ka ị gaa.
This is a pleasure they have the ability.	Nke a bụ ihe obi ụtọ nke ha nwere ikike.
This city has a few trees.	Obodo a nwere osisi ole na ole.
He told me that our parents were not our parents.	Ọ gwara m na ndị mụrụ anyị abụghị nne na nna anyị.
Information is power for me.	Ozi bụ ike nye m.
It doesn’t run sideways.	Ọ naghị agba n'akụkụ.
Either way, buy this book.	Ụzọ ọ bụla, zụta akwụkwọ a.
He turned around, surprised.	Ọ gbara gburugburu, tụrụ ya n'anya.
How and why are you an actor?	Kedu otu na gịnị kpatara ị ji bụrụ onye na-eme ihe nkiri?
My father told me it was a bad idea.	Nna m gwara m na ọ bụ echiche ọjọọ.
You should call the police.	Ị kwesịrị ịkpọ onye uwe ojii.
They are all around.	Ọ dị ha gburugburu.
Only one.	Naanị otu.
Or you.	Ma ọ bụ gị.
He didn't seem to do it.	Ọ dịghị ka o mere ya.
But it will be the same.	Ma otu ahụ ka ọ ga-adị.
He wanted to be in it.	Ọ chọrọ ịnọ na ya.
You are better than others.	Ị ka ndị ọzọ mma.
It can happen on its own.	Ọ nwere ike ime onwe ya.
No one can know.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ịma.
This we may not do.	Nke a nwere ike anyị agaghị eme.
This is not good.	Nke a adịghị mma.
But he could not run fast.	Mana ọ nweghị ike ịgba ọsọ ọsọ.
It is a very important story.	Ọ bụ akụkọ dị oke mkpa.
He would like to travel early.	Ọ ga-amasị ya ịga njem n'oge.
Your clothes are full of water.	Mmiri juru uwe gị.
That’s a new employee every year.	Nke ahụ bụ onye ọrụ ọ bụla na-eme ọhụrụ kwa afọ.
The reason told him he was really the best.	Ihe kpatara ya gwara ya na ọ kacha mma n'ezie.
Twice as much, of course.	Ugboro abụọ nke ukwuu, n'ezie.
They like to be able to be whatever they want or be.	Ọ na-amasị ha inwe ike ịbụ ihe ọ bụla ha chọrọ ma ọ bụ onye ọ bụla.
I thought it was their life.	M chere na ọ bụ ndụ ha.
It is better to stay in front of the game.	Ọ ka mma ịnọ n'ihu egwuregwu ahụ.
People about him told him a little.	Ndị banyere ya gwara ya ntakịrị.
About them.	Ihe gbasara ha.
It's clear.	O doro anya.
We are accustomed to them.	Anyị maara ha ahụ́.
You are all my friends.	Unu niile bụ ndị enyi m.
It is man-made.	Ọ bụ mmadụ mere ọgwụ ọjọọ.
I had a plan then.	Enwere m atụmatụ mgbe ahụ.
He thought about it.	O chere banyere ya.
The market seems weak both long-term and short-term.	Ahịa ahụ dị ka adịghị ike ma ogologo oge na obere oge.
It's not a thing.	Ọ bụghị ihe.
Her parents were hopeless.	Ndị mụrụ ya enweghị olileanya.
Beautiful car.	Ụgbọ ala mara mma.
The fighting is still four weeks old.	Ọgụ a ka dị izu anọ.
They just want to live.	Naanị ha chọrọ ịdị ndụ.
The boy liked the tree.	Osisi ahụ masịrị nwata nwoke ahụ.
He can do it.	O nwere ike ime ya.
He knew the car was in my house.	Ọ ma na ụgbọ ala ahụ dị n'ụlọ m.
This is very bad for me.	Nke a dị m ezigbo njọ.
He speaks well.	Ọ na-ekwu nke ọma.
You have another long day ahead of you.	Ị nwere ogologo ụbọchị ọzọ n'ihu gị.
But she never asked him a question.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe ọ jụrụ ya ajụjụ.
This question should be simple and quick.	Ajụjụ a kwesịrị ịdị mfe na ngwa ngwa.
You deserve the best and go for it.	I kwesịrị ihe kacha mma wee gaa maka ya.
They work all day.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ ụbọchị niile.
He seems to like the house very much.	Ọ dị ka ọ masịrị ụlọ ahụ nke ukwuu.
I am 20 years old.	Adị m mma afọ iri abụọ.
Please continue with the story.	Biko gaa n'ihu na akụkọ.
At the same time he needs to move on.	N'otu oge ahụ ọ dị ya mkpa ka ọ gaa n'ihu.
Again, there is an easy way around this.	Ọzọ, e nwere ụzọ dị mfe gburugburu nke a.
I know that's what you're thinking.	Ama m na nke ahụ bụ ihe ị na-eche.
And there is a lot of space.	Na ebe ahụ nwere oke oke.
How did the two men do it?	Kedu ka ndị mmadụ abụọ ahụ si mee ya?
I really liked the house and had everything we needed.	Ụlọ ahụ masịrị m nke ukwuu ma anyị nwere ihe niile anyị chọrọ.
Not just here.	Ọ bụghị naanị ebe a.
I have my own machine.	Enwere m igwe nke m.
They said two hours.	Ha kwuru awa abụọ.
They can not.	Ha apụghị.
Love your friends.	Hụ ndị enyi gị n'anya.
Another important point here is women's rights.	Ihe ọzọ dị mkpa ebe a bụ ikike ụmụ nwanyị.
Many more.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ.
I met him earlier.	M zutere ya na mbụ.
He went.	Ọ gara.
This is a wonderful place to be!	Nke a bụ ebe dị egwu ịnọ!
It's like having legs.	Ihe ọ dị ka inwe ụkwụ.
The other thought it was different.	Nke nke ọzọ chere na ọ dị iche.
Of everyone and no one, of everything and everything.	Nke onye ọ bụla na ọ dịghị onye, ​​nke ihe niile na ihe ọ bụla.
It makes sense if you think about it.	Ọ bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-eche banyere ya.
Several types of fires surrounded the night.	Ọtụtụ ụdị ọkụ ọkụ gbara gburugburu n'abalị.
One of the worst things that could have happened to him.	Otu n’ime ihe kacha njọ o chere mere ya.
I looked at the man to my right.	M lere nwoke ahụ n'aka nri m anya.
So there may be a way to do the same.	Ya mere enwere ike inwe ụzọ ime otu ihe ahụ.
When looking around, there are many ways to do this.	Mgbe anya na gburugburu, e nwere ọtụtụ ụzọ ime nke a.
Not the only way.	Ọ bụghị naanị ụzọ.
It’s a lot of work to find anything, too.	Ọ bụ ọtụtụ ọrụ ịchọta ihe ọ bụla, kwa.
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, o kwesịghị.
Which way is the ferry to?	Kedu ụzọ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ na-aga?
He went to the other side.	Ọ gara n'akụkụ nke ọzọ.
It is worth it.	Ọ bụ ihe bara uru.
He gave a lot.	O nyere ọtụtụ ihe.
About once a week for a year.	Ihe dị ka otu ugboro n'izu maka otu afọ.
We will not be told anything.	Agaghị agwa anyị ihe ọ bụla.
Food does not work.	Nri anaghị arụ ọrụ.
No family is with him at the moment.	Ọ dịghị ezinụlọ ya na ya nọ n'ụlọ ọgwụ n'oge a.
But I really liked it.	Ma ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu.
Different types of clothes are available.	Ụdị akwa dị iche iche dị.
To my surprise no one else heard it.	O juru m anya na o nweghị onye ọzọ nụrụ ya.
Of course, it is far from over.	N'ezie, ọ dị anya na ya.
You do not sew.	Ị naghị akwa akwa.
He left soon.	Ọ pụrụ n'oge na-adịghị anya.
I'm sure of that.	Eji m n'aka na nke ahụ.
How, for a while, he felt like it was possible.	Olee otú, ruo nwa oge, ọ dị ya ka o kwere omume.
They are on their way.	Ha na-aga n'ụzọ.
We were all scared.	Ụjọ tụrụ anyị niile.
For better or worse, you have to move on.	Maka mma ma ọ bụ njọ, ị ga-aga n'ihu.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
Then here.	Mgbe ahụ ebe a.
Obesity now is a big problem.	Ibu ibu ugbu a bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
Or because they do.	Ma ọ bụ n'ihi na ha na-eme.
I have no problem with it.	Enweghị m nsogbu na ya.
I should know better.	m kwesịrị ịma nke ọma.
That is the only way.	Ọ bụ naanị ụzọ ahụ.
Of course you are.	N'ezie, ị dị mma.
This was last month.	Nke a bụ ọnwa gara aga.
It was my day.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị m.
The police are now there.	Ndị uwe ojii nọ ebe ahụ ugbu a.
This craving is an old family story.	Agụụ a bụ akụkọ ezinụlọ ochie.
But it is awesome.	Ma ọ dị egwu.
The study of the weather.	Ọmụmụ nke ihu igwe.
So only three of them are free.	Ya mere ọ bụ naanị atọ n'ime ha nwere onwe ha.
It is ten o'clock in the morning.	Ọ bụ elekere iri na iri nke ụtụtụ.
She was next to tears of fear.	Ọ nọ n'akụkụ anya mmiri ụjọ.
Tried but not there.	Gbalịrị ma ọ bụghị ebe ahụ.
A friendly and friendly dog.	Nkịta enyi na enyi mara mma.
Do what you can.	Mee ihe niile i nwere ike ime.
His style of cooking is beautiful.	Ụdị esi nri ya mara mma.
To my surprise, it was still early.	Ọ tụrụ m n'anya na ọ ka dị n'oge.
This path goes further than the last.	Ụzọ a gara n'ihu karịa nke ikpeazụ.
I will help others now.	M ga-enyere ndị ọzọ aka ugbu a.
We did not see anyone by the side.	Anyị ahụghị onye ọ bụla n'akụkụ.
It's tough.	O siri ike.
But not just do.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị ime.
I like it.	Ọ masịrị m.
We need efficient transportation.	Anyị chọrọ ụgbọ njem na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
He said it was something he would do.	O kwuru na ọ bụ ihe ọ ga-eme.
I am clear now.	O doro m anya ugbu a.
So he has a responsibility.	Ya mere o nwere ibu ọrụ.
We will be home next year.	Anyị ga-anọ n'ụlọ n'afọ ọzọ.
But only a little.	Mana naanị ntakịrị.
Within a week, they were things.	N'ime otu izu, ha bụ ihe.
No matter how you may think about it.	N'agbanyeghị otú i nwere ike na-eche banyere ya.
His path is clear.	Ụzọ ya doro anya.
But, you see, those are two different types.	Ma, ị hụrụ, ndị ahụ bụ ụdị abụọ dị iche iche.
The new is the old.	Nke ọhụrụ bụ ochie.
It's not just people like me.	Ọ bụghị naanị ndị dị ka m.
I never mentioned it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m kwuru banyere ya.
It is the only way you are free.	Ọ bụ naanị ụzọ ị nwere onwe gị.
He had a job to help him.	O nwere ọrụ ya nyere ya aka.
That was the first thought.	Nke ahụ bụ echiche mbụ.
He loved that.	Ọ hụrụ nke ahụ n'anya.
Four of them died.	Mmadụ anọ n’ime ha nwụrụ.
He wondered what he had left for himself.	Ọ nọ na-eche ihe ọ hapụrụ onwe ya maka ya.
That was perfect for me.	Nke ahụ zuru oke maka m.
I have a little story about it.	Enwere m obere akụkọ na ya.
It can be cold and scary.	O nwere ike ịdị oyi na ụjọ.
I really needed to get angry with people.	Ọ dị m nnọọ mkpa ka m were mmadụ iwe n'ezie.
There is no such thing.	O nweghị ihe dị otú ahụ.
Low cost, awesome.	Ihe dị ala, dị egwu.
Whatever that was, he needed it.	Ihe ọ bụla nke ahụ bụ, ọ chọrọ ya.
I am very grateful for their work.	Enwere m obi ụtọ nke ukwuu maka ọrụ ha.
No, it really is.	Mba, ọ bụ ya n'ezie.
But he had an opportunity to think.	Ma o nwere ohere iche echiche.
I suggest you get a better weapon.	Ana m atụ aro ka ị nweta ngwa ọgụ ka mma.
It really is.	Ọ bụ n'ezie.
It's funny.	Ọ na-atọ ọchị.
Mothers should love their children.	Ndị nne kwesịrị ịhụ ụmụ ha n'anya.
The best.	Ihe kacha mma.
Where he is.	Ebe ọ nọ.
Anyone can do those things.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ike ime ihe ndị ahụ.
But let me tell you this.	Mana ka m gwa gị ihe a.
Because we are so sure.	N'ihi na anyị ji n'aka nke ukwuu.
I want to know what they are.	Achọrọ m ịma ihe ha bụ.
Clearly, lovers do not exist.	O doro anya na ndị hụrụ ibe ha n'anya anọghị.
If necessary, leave the house.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mkpa, pụọ n'ụlọ.
I have a chance for it.	Enwere m ohere maka ya.
I do not want to challenge you.	Achọghị m ịma gị aka.
It's not just stupid thinking.	Ọ bụghị naanị echiche nzuzu.
I can not do that.	Enweghị m ike ime nke ahụ.
Enjoy your trip!	Nwee obi ụtọ na njem gị!
My family, my children.	Ezinụlọ m, ụmụ m.
He is so far away.	Ọ nọ nnọọ ebe dị anya.
This meeting continues today.	Nzukọ a na-aga n'ihu taa.
Then go to the airport, please.	Mgbe ahụ gaa n'ọdụ ụgbọ elu, biko.

That's where you get to know it.	Ọ bụ ebe ahụ ka ị ga-esi mara ya.

But this is still good.	Mana nke a ka dị mma.
For months, he spoke to them both at different times.	Ruo ọtụtụ ọnwa, ọ gwara ha abụọ okwu n’oge dị iche iche.
Not the same everywhere.	Ọ bụghị otu ihe ahụ n'ebe niile.
It is wonderful to be happy.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ihe dị mma mmadụ inwe obi ụtọ.

Only a few did so.	Ọ bụ naanị mmadụ ole na ole mere otú ahụ.

All is well.	Ihe niile dị mma.
It is the cause and not the only one.	Ọ bụ ihe kpatara ya ma ọ bụghị naanị ya.
He said that now it is not good.	O kwuru na ugbu a adịghị mma.
But this is very different.	Ma nke a dị nnọọ iche.
Not the way.	Ọ bụghị ụzọ.
They do this every year.	Ha na-eme nke a kwa afọ.
He knew how to calm people down.	Ọ ma otú ọ ga-esi eme ka ahụ́ ruo ndị mmadụ ala.
No one can do that again.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ime nke ahụ ọzọ.
He has thoughts in his heart that should come out.	O nwere echiche n'obi ya nke kwesịrị ịpụ.
As it should.	Dị ka o kwesịrị ịdị.

I think this group has a first floor.	Echere m na otu a nwere nke mbụ ala.
He wondered if they were still looking for him.	Ọ nọ na-eche ma ha ka na-achọ ya.
They don’t make the first trip.	Ha anaghị eme njem mbụ.

There is no reason to do so here.	Enweghị ihe kpatara ime ya ebe a.
There is no limit.	Enweghị oke.
Whatever it was, it fell short.	Ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ, ọ dara nso.
This is the last one.	Nke a bụ nke ikpeazụ.
The woman was angry.	Iwe were nwanyị ahụ.
It has a quick effect.	O nwere mmetụta ọsọ ọsọ.
In practice.	Na omume.

She gave him a shirt on his back.	O nyere ya uwe elu n'azụ ya.
You know it's impossible.	Ị ma na ọ gaghị ekwe omume.

He was a vegetarian.	Ọ bụ onye anaghị eri anụ.

They should help you.	Ha kwesịrị inyere gị aka.
Not a city, not a city.	Ọ bụghị obodo, ọ bụghị obodo.
He was so angry, he could hardly speak.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu, o siri ike ikwu okwu.
It is different now.	Ọ dị iche ugbu a.
They surrounded me like water.	Ha gbara m gburugburu dị ka mmiri.
He drinks water before any meal.	Ọ na-aṅụ mmiri tupu nri ọ bụla.
One is that you are going to buy it from the past.	Otu bụ na ị na-aga zụta ya site n'oge gara aga.
No one really believed him.	Ọ dịghị onye kwere ya n'ezie.
Because of this he loves them.	N'ihi nke a ọ hụrụ ha n'anya.
The room is very nice.	Ime ụlọ ahụ dị ezigbo mma.

The point is clear.	Ihe a na-ekwu doro anya.
His store was stolen that summer.	E zuru ụlọ ahịa ya n'oge okpomọkụ ahụ.
He knew they were here.	Ọ ma na ha nọ ebe a.

Everything is well known, not just food.	Ihe niile maara nke ọma, ọ bụghị naanị nri.

But he was afraid.	Ma ọ tụrụ egwu.
The main thing is that you do not want to do this.	Isi ihe bụ na ị chọghị ime nke a.
Of course, he had something to do with it.	N'ezie, o nwere ihe na-eme ya.
Things like.	Ihe ndị dị ka .
There are good people and bad people.	E nwere ndị ezigbo mmadụ na ndị ọjọọ.
Gradually it came.	Nke nta nke nta ọ bịara.
I was out of the hospital and continued for many years.	Anọ m n'ụlọ ọgwụ pụọ ma na-aga n'ihu ruo ọtụtụ afọ.

She was obviously wearing it, no matter what her dress suggested.	O doro anya na o si n'aka, n'agbanyeghị ihe uwe ya tụrụ aro.
But still, it seems to be small.	Ma ka ọ dị, o yiri ka ọ dị obere.
No one knew that the baby was in the room.	Ọ dịghị onye maara na nwa ahụ nọ n'ime ụlọ.
For the name.	Maka aha.
The president's wife spoke to the president.	Nwunye onye isi ala nyere onye isi ala okwu.
Inside the room.	N'ime ime ụlọ.
However, there is humor.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ọchị.

Water is essential for everyone.	Mmiri bụ ihe dị mkpa maka mmadụ niile.
He heard the name fall.	Ọ nụrụ ka aha dara.

We do this in different ways.	Anyị na-eme nke a n'ụzọ dị iche iche.
He still has a big heart.	Ọ ka nwere nnukwu obi.
But then no.	Ma mgbe ahụ, ọ dịghị.
He left the room.	O siri n'ime ụlọ pụọ.
It is legal.	Ọ bụ iwu.

No doubt his father had money.	O doro anya na nna ya nwere ego.
We never talked about anything more personal than that.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị kwuru banyere ihe ọ bụla ọzọ nke onwe karịa nke ahụ.

None of these situations are very similar.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ọnọdụ ahụ yiri nnọọ.

You do not have to go alone.	I kwesịghị ịga naanị gị.
Until now, he thought it was his job.	Ruo ugbu a, o chere na ọ bụ ọrụ ya.
The disease is progressing well.	Ọrịa ahụ na-aga nke ọma.

Or at least he seemed wise.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, ọ dị ka onye maara ihe.
Each group has a role to play.	Otu ọ bụla nwere ọrụ ha na-arụ.
I say let's not go there for a while.	Asị m ka anyị ghara ịga ebe ahụ nwa oge.
I love them both.	Ahụrụ m ha abụọ n'anya.
They can not help you.	Ha enweghị ike inyere gị aka.
The challenge is not time.	Ihe ịma aka abụghị oge.

This challenging journey was very worthwhile.	Njem a siri ike bara nnọọ uru.
There is nothing like this.	Ọ nweghị ihe yiri ebe a.
Her husband suddenly fell ill.	Di ya dara ọrịa na mberede.

You can do something like this.	Ị nwere ike ime ihe dị ka nke a.

So he was angry.	N'ihi ya, iwe were ya.
Of course, you know it.	N'ezie, ị maara ya.

He never mentioned his family.	Ọ dịghị mgbe o kwuru banyere ezinụlọ ya.

The clock stopped a few minutes.	Elekere ahụ kwụsịrị nkeji ole na ole.
He is my favorite student.	Ọ bụ nwa akwụkwọ kacha amasị m.

Do you need help with your homework?	Ị chọrọ enyemaka na ọrụ ụlọ gị?

About 20 people attended each.	Ihe dị ka mmadụ iri abụọ bịara na nke ọ bụla.

But the second time it was bigger right away.	Ma oge nke abụọ ọ bụ ibu ozugbo.
Many companies operate within the metropolitan area.	Ọtụtụ ụlọ ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ n'ime oke obodo.
He loves her so much and so much.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu na enweghị atụ.
They talked about his brother and his house.	Ha kwuru banyere nwanne ya nwoke na ụlọ ya.
This is an easy task.	Nke a bụ ọrụ dị mfe.

All benefits go to community assistance funds.	Uru niile na-aga na ego enyemaka obodo.
So they did not, either.	Ya mere, ha emeghị, ma.
Not a big deal.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu isi.
He will not do it.	Ọ gaghị eme ya.
It does not make medicine here.	Ọ naghị eme ọgwụ ebe a.
It will help us.	Ọ ga-enyere anyị aka.
Despite the team.	N'agbanyeghị ndị otu.
We went there last year.	Anyị gara ebe ahụ n'afọ gara aga.
He does it every year.	Ọ na-eme ya kwa afọ.
You don't really want me.	Ị chọghị m n'ezie.
He told me to stop.	Ọ gwara m ka m kwụsị.
One summer, it won’t be.	N'otu oge okpomọkụ, ọ gaghị adị.

Time goes on.	Oge na-aga n'ihu.

Company officials visited the headquarters.	Ndị isi ụlọ ọrụ gara n'isi ụlọ ahụ.
I don't know what that is.	Amaghị m ihe ihe ahụ bụ.

It would be nice of that.	Ọ ga-adị mma nke ahụ.
The workers were terrified of their work.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ tụrụ egwu maka ọrụ ha.
Then dad.	Mgbe ahụ, nna.
He knows everything.	Ọ maara ihe niile.
Love it, love it, love it.	Hụ ya n'anya, hụ ya n'anya, hụ ya n'anya.
But the policeman had other ideas.	Ma onye uwe ojii ahụ nwere echiche ndị ọzọ.
They find themselves there.	Ha hụrụ onwe ha n'ebe ahụ.
My mother went there.	Nne m gara ebe ahụ.
Of course, this is nothing new.	O doro anya na nke a abụghị ihe ọhụrụ.
You are here.	Ị nọrọ ebe a.
You are not a friend.	Ị bụghị enyi.
That is what started, but it is not.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe malitere, ma ọ bụghị ya.

This time it is not going well.	Oge a ọ naghị aga nke ọma.
Of course, everything can be fine.	N'ezie, ihe niile nwere ike ịdị mma.

There seems to be no face of friendship here.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ihu enyi ebe a.
But it's a good feeling.	Ma ọ bụ mmetụta dị mma.
Some, no doubt, benefit.	Ụfọdụ, obi abụọ adịghị ya, uru.
Do you like my clothes?	Uwe m ọ masịrị gị?
He saw what he did.	Ọ hụrụ ihe o mere.
It is hard work.	Ọ bụ ọrụ siri ike.
My son told the truth.	Nwa m nwoke kwuru eziokwu.
We are here this summer.	Anyị nọ n'oge okpomọkụ ebe a.
It may not exist, but it does happen.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị adị, mana ọ na-eme.
We had the most enjoyable time there.	Anyị nwere oge kacha atọ ụtọ n'ebe ahụ.
I think it will help.	Echere na ọ ga-enyere aka.
They can do it on their own, in a few minutes.	Ha nwere ike ime ya n'onwe ha, n'ime nkeji ole na ole.
He said he was waiting for us.	O kwuru na ya nọ na-eche ka anyị bịa.
They want fun.	Ha na-achọ ihe ọchị.
But he is confident in them.	Ma o nwere obi ike na ha.
It is, or is trying to be, the plant.	Ọ bụ, ma ọ bụ na-agbalị ịbụ, osisi ahụ.
Everyone helped a lot.	Onye ọ bụla nyere aka nke ukwuu.
The men were amazed.	Ọchị juru ụmụ nwoke ahụ ọnụ.
It is a strong ball as it is.	Ọ bụ bọọlụ ike dị ka ọ dị.
I say if you want that time, take it.	Asị m ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ oge ahụ, were ya.
That is how many people will buy into his idea.	Nke ahụ bụ otú ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ga-esi zụta n'ime echiche ya.
You like your work.	Ọrụ gị masịrị gị.
In time, some of them started talking.	Ka oge na-aga, ụfọdụ n’ime ha malitere ikwu okwu.
It's still good.	Ọ ka dị mma.
Anything but this.	Ihe ọ bụla ma nke a.
But not much is known.	Ma a maghị ọtụtụ ihe.
For the same reason.	N'ihi otu ihe ahụ.
Your face is the same way.	Ihu gị bụ otu ụzọ ahụ.
But for him it will be true.	Ma nye ya ọ ga-abụ eziokwu.

A long way back, it seems.	A ogologo ụzọ n'azụ, o yiri.
They are the only women they want.	Ha bụ naanị ụmụ nwanyị ha chọrọ.
I do not know if it will happen.	Amaghị ma ọ bụrụ na ọ ga-eme.
However, there are some areas for that.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ụfọdụ ebe ọ bara uru.
This is to give their employees the best possible service.	Nke a bụ iji nye ndị ọrụ ha ọrụ kacha mma.
Her beautiful baby is alive.	Nwa ya mara mma dị ndụ.
They are no longer afraid.	Ha anaghị atụ egwu ọzọ.
You had a good idea there a few years ago.	Ị nwere ezi echiche ebe ahụ afọ ole na ole gara aga.
But this is it.	Ma nke a bụ ya.
You never want to be a sailor.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ị chọrọ ịbụ ndị ụgbọ mmiri.
Give them reason to buy these items.	Nye ha ihe ha ga-eji zụta ihe ndị a.
Two of the staff told us this.	Mmadụ abụọ n'ime ndị ọrụ gwara anyị nke a.
This is a very important job.	Nke a bụ ọrụ dị oke mkpa.
No one knows how long ago we came there.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ogologo oge gara aga anyị bịara ebe ahụ.
Brave, little woman.	Obi ike, obere nwanyị.
One good story is better than the other.	Otu akụkọ mara mma dị mma ka nke ọzọ.
I miss you so much.	A na m atụ uche gị nke ukwuu.
I will never be afraid again.	Agaghị m atụ egwu ọzọ.
He saw many battles.	Ọ hụrụ ọtụtụ ọgụ.
But this situation is beyond me.	Mana ọnọdụ a karịrị m.
I pointed to a tree.	M tụrụ aka na osisi.
More than two years now.	Ihe karịrị afọ abụọ ugbu a.
Have fun every minute.	Nwee obi ụtọ kwa nkeji.
Ten years ago, the project was discontinued.	Afọ iri gara aga, a kwụsịrị ọrụ ahụ.
Not there.	Ọ bụghị ebe ahụ.
Winter is coming.	Oyi oyi na-abịa.
Still, finding that location is not easy.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ịchọta ebe ahụ adịghị mfe.
There is music and drinks.	E nwere egwu na ihe ọṅụṅụ.
So we come to the cold, hard truth.	Ya mere, anyị na-abịa na oyi, eziokwu siri ike.
He was amazed.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.
I have put together some models to help you see the issue clearly.	M tinyere ụfọdụ ụdị iji nyere aka hụ okwu ahụ nke ọma.
Irrigation and travel go hand in hand.	Ịgba mmiri na njem na-aga aka.
It's tough.	O siri ike.
For food, or buy snacks.	Maka nri, ma ọ bụ zụta nri nri.
My children, too.	Ụmụ m, kwa.
I actually saw some.	Ahụrụ m ụfọdụ n'ezie.
Not me, of course.	Ọ bụghị na m, n'ezie.
I would like your opinion.	Echiche gị ga-amasị m.
Every foot goes.	Ụkwụ niile na-aga.
He was a good man at heart and could rarely do any harm to anyone.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwoke maara ihe.
But it can be done.	Ma enwere ike ime ya.
So we went.	Ya mere, anyị gara.
Thanks for the question.	Daalụ maka ajụjụ ahụ.
In it for a man.	Na ya maka nwoke.
Still, there is something in common sense to expect.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, e nwere ihe dị na ezi uche na-atụ anya echiche.
She is a very talkative woman.	Ọ bụ nwanyị na-ekwu okwu nke ukwuu.
Because it's good.	N'ihi na ọ dị mma.
This is true.	Nke a bụ eziokwu.
You have to wait a long time to make your trip.	Ị na-eche ogologo oge iji mee njem gị.
The test is good.	Ule ọ dara.
I have it.	Enwere m ya.
They say it's cold.	Ha na-ekwu na oyi na-atụ.
It is a promise.	Ọ bụ nkwa.
Quickly he stopped.	Ngwa ngwa ọ kwụsịrị.
He could not tell her that.	O nweghị ike ịgwa ya otú ahụ.
I can not tell you anything.	Enweghị m ike ịgwa gị ihe ọ bụla.
She is in tears.	Anya mmiri juru ya anya.
It's fun	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
It does not happen.	Ọ naghị eme.
Then everything works.	Mgbe ahụ, ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ.
This is really a picture of life.	Nke a bụ n'ezie foto nke ndụ.
The point is this.	Isi okwu bụ nke a.
The food was beautiful.	Nri ahụ mara mma.
Continue with your own work.	Gaa n'ihu na ọrụ nke gị.
Then stop there waiting.	Mgbe ahụ kwụsị ebe ahụ chere.
I would like him to have a similar interest.	Ọ ga-amasị m ka o nwee mmasị yiri nke ahụ.
Last night, three times.	N'abalị ụnyaahụ, ugboro atọ.
Or less is required.	Ma ọ bụ obere ka achọrọ.
Two girls and one boy.	Ụmụ agbọghọ abụọ na otu nwoke.
If I do not know what he has gone through, I will feel different.	Ọ bụrụ na amaghị m ihe ọ gara aga, ọ ga-adị m ka m dị iche.
Your eyes are strong.	Anya gị siri ike.
He was the one who played the flute until his death.	Ọ bụ ya na-egwu ndị ahụ ruo mgbe ọ nwụrụ.
You are a good girl, he said.	Ị bụ ezigbo nwa agbọghọ, o kwuru.
But he wants them to do it too.	Ma ọ chọrọ ka ha mee ya.
But it is not so.	Ma ọ bụghị otú a.
They asked him his name.	Ha jụrụ ya aha ya.
But he was there.	Ma ọ nọ ebe ahụ.
Is it dangerous.	Ọ dị egwu.
I might be fine.	Enwere m ike ịdị mma.
He should not see the book.	O kwesịghị ịhụ akwụkwọ ahụ.
I do not want one.	Achọghị m otu.
I do not like it very much.	Enweghị m mmasị na nke ukwuu.
He does not want to leave now.	Ọ chọghị ka ọ pụọ ugbu a.
They are about a month old today and are doing well.	Ha dị ihe dị ka otu ọnwa taa ma na-eme nke ọma.
They are still looking for us.	Ha ka na-achọ anyị.
They are too fast.	Ha dị oke ọsọ.

He has special eyes.	O nwere anya pụrụ iche.
Tell him everything you want to say.	Gwa ya ihe niile ị chọrọ ikwu.
Some doctors take other medications.	Ụfọdụ ndị dọkịta na-eme ọgwụ ọzọ.
But the first model has its limits.	Ma ụdị mbụ ahụ nwere oke ya.
He would visit her once or twice.	Ọ gaara ya n'ụlọ otu ugboro ma ọ bụ ugboro abụọ.
The unparalleled sense of beauty is strong.	Mmetụta na-enweghị atụ nke ịma mma siri ike.
I may be somewhere else tonight.	Enwere m ike ịnọ ebe ọzọ n'abalị a.
Not how it works anymore.	Ọ bụghị otú ọ na-arụ ọrụ ọzọ.
They can go either way.	Ha nwere ike ịga n'ụzọ ọ bụla.
But they are small.	Ma ha dị obere.
But that is not.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị.
But that is not your problem.	Mana ọ bụghị nsogbu gị.
We will not go there in time if we do this!	Anyị agaghị aga ebe ahụ n'oge ma anyị mee nke a!
I think it works really well.	Echere m na ọ na-arụ ezigbo ọrụ.
We need to do that.	Anyị kwesịrị ime nke ahụ.
But that is what they did.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe ha mere.
It may not be easy, but it is possible.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị adị mfe, mana enwere ike ime ya.
Kind of like you.	Ụdị dị ka gị.
But the money is not important.	Ma ego ahụ adịghị mkpa.
Drugs have a strong effect on addicts.	Ọgwụ ọjọọ nwere mmetụta siri ike na ndị na-eri ahụ.
Laughter alone.	Ọchị naanị ya.
At first it was beautiful.	Na mbụ ọ mara mma.
Now it is better to talk about it.	Ugbu a ọ dị mma ka okwu ya.
Everything you say speaks with confidence.	Ihe niile ị na-ekwu na-ekwu na obi ike.
The church has a lot of history.	Ụka nwere ọtụtụ akụkọ ihe mere eme.
It will go on.	Ọ ga-aga n'ihu.
As soon as he told me he loved swimming.	Ozugbo ọ gwara m na ọ hụrụ igwu mmiri n'anya.
They know where they are.	Ha maara ebe ha nọrọ.
I know the feeling.	Amaara m mmetụta ahụ.
Few people know who my family is.	Ọ bụ mmadụ ole na ole maara ndị ezinụlọ m bụ.
Some medications may have side effects.	Ụfọdụ ọgwụ nwere ike inwe mmetụta na-adịghị mma.
The time is coming, he thought.	Oge na-abịa, o chere.
This should be important, because not everyone has them.	Nke a kwesịrị ịdị mkpa, n'ihi na ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla nwere ha.
I do that for sure.	Ana m eme nke ahụ n'aka.
It’s a bigger movie.	Ọ bụ ihe nkiri ka ukwuu.
That's fine with me.	Nke ahụ dị m mma.
Until we meet again.	Ruo mgbe anyị zutere ọzọ.
Officials stopped.	Ndị isi kwụsịrị.
Nothing more than that.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọzọ karịa nke ahụ.
It's just the truth.	Ọ bụ naanị eziokwu.
And that's the key.	Na nke ahụ bụ isi.
His frightened eyes awaited me.	Anya egwu ya chere m.
He has some hearing problems.	O nwere nsogbu ntị ụfọdụ na-eme ugbu a.
These are things that women do not do.	Ihe ndị a bụ ihe ụmụ nwanyị anaghị eme.
It will be the same tomorrow.	Otú ahụ ka echi ga-adị.
Fear for our patients, for our work.	Na-atụ egwu maka ndị ọrịa anyị, maka ọrụ anyị.
Frequency is too high.	Ugboro ugboro dị oke elu.
Nothing small.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị obere.

Today, we know a lot.	Taa, anyị maara ọtụtụ ihe.
I have a good family.	Enwere m ezi ezinụlọ.
He could not do it on his own.	O nweghị ike ime ya n'onwe ya.
It looks like that again.	Ọ dị ka nke ahụ ọzọ.
His idea seems to work.	Echiche ya yiri ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
No need, get out of here.	Enweghị mkpa, pụọ ebe a.
Not when what they did to me.	Ọ bụghị mgbe ihe ha mere m.
The best small for every day.	Obere kacha mma maka ụbọchị ọ bụla.
That is not the way he uses language.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka o si eji asụsụ eme ihe.
They do not die fast.	Ha anaghị anwụ ngwa ngwa.
I am not.	Abụghị m ya.
He will be at home for a week.	Ọ ga-anọ n'ụlọ n'ime otu izu.
But that is not because it is easy.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị n'ihi na ọ dị mfe.
The girl was pregnant by her boyfriend.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ dị ime site na enyi ya nwoke.
Just move on with life.	Naanị gaa n'ihu na ndụ.
It’s a big job, but of course not impossible.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ọrụ, mana n'ezie ọ bụghị nke agaghị ekwe omume.
People need to know what happened.	Ndị mmadụ kwesịrị ịma ihe merenụ.
Calling people on the phone scared me.	Ịkpọ ndị mmadụ na ekwentị tụrụ m ụjọ.
Anger is there.	Iwe dị ebe ahụ.
I will not go anywhere.	Agaghị m aga ebe ọ bụla.
This police officer is beautiful.	Onye uwe ojii a mara mma.
They are different games.	Ha bụ egwuregwu dị iche iche.
But of course, he will not be there.	Ma n'ezie, ọ gaghị anọ ebe ahụ.
That is not good for everyone, none of us.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma maka onye ọ bụla, ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị.
However, that is the way it feels.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụ otú ọ dị ya.
This is for a number of reasons.	Nke a bụ maka ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
I am really one way.	Abụ m otu ụzọ n'ezie.
The story is well known.	Akụkọ a maara nke ọma.
We are really different.	Anyị dị iche n'ezie.
Some do well.	Ụfọdụ na-eme nke ọma.
One thread will have one or more of these periods.	Otu eri ga-enwe otu ma ọ bụ karịa n'ime oge ndị a.
I will have my own green.	M ga-enwe akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ nke m.
I don't know why because everything was fine at first.	Amaghị ihe kpatara ya n'ihi na ihe niile dị mma na mbụ.
No one can say anything to any of us.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ịgwa onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị ihe ọ bụla.
This is true.	Nke a bụ eziokwu.
He refused to believe the story.	Ọ jụrụ ikweta akụkọ ahụ.
They should not be good at it.	Ha ekwesịghị ịdị mma na ya.
It's not as easy as you think.	Ọ dịghị mfe dị ka i chere.
But today, they will be.	Ma taa, ha ga-adị.
But they are not there now.	Ma ha anọghị ebe ahụ ugbu a.
None of these work for me.	Nke ọ bụla n'ime ndị a adịghị arụ ọrụ maka m.
Today you have it with you.	Taa nwere gị na ya.
The temperature dropped overnight.	Okpomọkụ ahụ dara nke ukwuu n'ime abalị.
We know it's the truth.	Anyị ma na ọ bụ ihe bụ́ eziokwu.
I do not want to use it.	Achọghị m iji ya.
There is more to the story than that.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe na akụkọ ahụ, karịa ya.
How many people live here?	Mmadụ ole bi ebe a?
He asked me my name.	Ọ jụrụ m aha m.
Then he realized.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ ghọtara.
And see them.	Ma hụ ha.
This city is fun, exciting.	Obodo a na-atọ ụtọ, na-atọ ụtọ.
You know your company better than anyone else.	Ị mara ụlọ ọrụ gị karịa onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
It is a very important thing.	Ọ bụ ihe dị ezigbo mkpa.
You know why.	Ị ma ihe kpatara ya.
They got it right away.	Ha nwetara ya ozugbo.
This route is not suitable for travelers.	Ụzọ a adịghị mma maka ndị njem.
All lights are on.	Ọkụ niile na-arụ ọrụ.
Unable to do so.	Enweghị ike ime.
Hope is something.	Olileanya bụ ihe.
Sure it is beautiful, but it will do nothing.	N'ezie ọ mara mma, mana o nweghị ihe ọ ga-eme.
What’s different, he asked?	Kedu ihe dị iche, ọ jụrụ?
You have your great mother inside you.	Ị nwere oke nne gị n'ime gị.
I could be that person.	Enwere m ike ịbụ onye ahụ.
We both like it.	Ha abụọ masịrị anyị.
They liked him for his work.	Ha masịrị ya maka ọrụ ya.
I do that.	Ana m eme nke ahụ.
I know your name.	Ama m aha gị.

I want to be a girl in it.	Achọrọ m ka m bụrụ nwa agbọghọ na ya.
I am enthusiastic!.	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu!.
That is not my opinion.	Nke ahụ abụghị echiche m.
He just does his job.	Ọ na-arụ naanị ọrụ ya.
However, that is probably not the case for everyone.	Otú ọ dị, eleghị anya ọ bụghị otú ahụ maka onye ọ bụla.
The company knows.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ maara.
Nice to see.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ.
But there is only land and big time.	Ma e nwere naanị ala na nnukwu oge.
The city wants to do it.	Obodo chọrọ ime ya.
Wear your shoes.	Yiri akpụkpọ ụkwụ gị.
Two of those things are very important.	Abụọ n'ime ihe ndị ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa.
Or we move on.	Ma ọ bụ anyị na-aga n'ihu.
I never gave him a chance.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m nyere ya ohere.
You can go either way with this.	Ị nwere ike ịga n'ụzọ ọ bụla na nke a.
The dog ate a large dog food bag.	Nkịta ahụ riri nnukwu akpa nri nkịta.
Not the worst, but soon the second.	Ọ bụghị nke kacha njọ, mana nso nso nke abụọ.
He acted like a fool.	O mere omume dị ka onye nzuzu.
Only two of them.	Ọ bụ naanị ha abụọ.
I'm fine.	Adị m mma.
I do not have many friends.	Enweghị m ọtụtụ ndị enyi.
Only a few people lived there at that time.	Ọ bụ naanị mmadụ ole na ole bi n’ebe ahụ n’oge ahụ.
I think a lot of people do it.	Echere m na ọtụtụ ndị na-eme ya.
It may not be for them.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ maka ha.
I want to see my family again.	Achọrọ m ịhụ ezinụlọ m ọzọ.
One last time.	Otu oge ikpeazụ.
He was right.	O kwuru eziokwu.
There is not much we can do.	O nweghị ọtụtụ ihe anyị ga-eme.
I studied this picture closely.	M mụrụ foto a nso.
Because they are important.	N'ihi na ha dị mkpa.
Human life has no value.	Ndụ mmadụ enweghị uru ọ bara.
We only had a few years.	Anyị nwere naanị afọ ole na ole.
That's when it happens.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka ọ na-eme.
Both are not doing well.	Ha abụọ adịghị eme nke ọma.
It runs in the water.	Ọ na-agba na mmiri.
He left me.	Ọ hapụrụ m.
He looks like my brother.	Ọ dị ka nwanne m.
I don't need money.	Ego adịghị m mkpa.
I don't see it very well.	Ahụghị m ya nke ukwuu.
I still have two things to do.	M ka nwere ihe abụọ m ga-eme.
This works well on another machine.	Nke a na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma na igwe ọzọ.
None of it is important anymore.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ya dị mkpa ọzọ.
We provided them with clothing, bedding and other supplies.	Anyị nyere ha uwe, akwa akwa na ihe ndị ọzọ.
It is not there.	Ọ dịghị ebe ahụ.

Further study will be needed.	Ọmụmụ ihe ọzọ ga-adị mkpa.
Everyone needs money.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ ego.
He does not like anything he does.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ na-eme dị ya mma.
There are two important cases.	Enwere ikpe abụọ dị mkpa.
It stopped for a dramatic effect.	Ọ kwụsịrị maka mmetụta dị egwu.
There are only enough home activities to keep me busy.	Enwere naanị ihe omume ụlọ zuru oke iji mee ka m nwee ọrụ n'aka.
I do not want.	Achọghị m.
Maybe it’s kind of a test.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ụdị ule.
She is unwell.	Ahụ adịghị ya mma.
It is so.	Otú a ka ọ dị.
It's not his thing.	Ọ bụghị ihe ya.
It was as well, he thought.	Ọ bụ dị ka nke ọma, o chere.
I have no doubt that is the case.	Enweghị m obi abụọ na nke ahụ bụ ikpe.
Why was there, he said, and there it was.	Gịnị mere na n'ebe ahụ, o kwuru, na n'ebe ahụ ka ọ dị.
This is what we have to do.	Nke a bụ ihe anyị ga-eme.
As a result, he gained a great reputation.	N'ihi ya, ọ nwetara aha dị ukwuu.
He looked at where he had died.	Ọ lere anya n’ebe ọ nwụrụ.
The violence silenced him.	Ime ihe ike ahụ mere ka ọ ghara ikwu okwu.
She is a good girl.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwa agbọghọ.
This book is not new.	Akwụkwọ a abụghị ọhụrụ.
You are very beautiful.	Ị mara mma nke ukwuu.
But that was then and this is now.	Ma nke ahụ bụ mgbe ahụ na nke a bụ ugbu a.
There is nothing worse than being cold.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị njọ karịa oyi ọjọọ.
What matters is one point.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ otu isi ihe.
But that’s the kind of thing that happens.	Mana nke ahụ bụ ụdị ihe na-eme.
So, please, do what you can.	Ya mere, biko, mee ihe ị nwere ike ime.
I can go anywhere.	Enwere m ike ịga ebe ọ bụla.
Most stories are for female patients.	Ọtụtụ akụkọ bụ maka ndị ọrịa nwanyị.
No one says anything temporarily.	Ọ dịghị onye na-ekwu ihe ọ bụla nwa oge.
I would like it.	Ọ ga-adị m mma.
You seem to have more than that.	O yiri ka ị nwere nke ahụ karịa ọtụtụ.
This is the second condition.	Nke a bụ ọnọdụ nke abụọ.
This movie has it all.	Ihe nkiri a nwere ihe niile.
They are not bad.	Ha adịghị njọ.
However, one building.	Otú ọ dị, otu ụlọ.
I can not go there.	Enweghị m ike ịga ebe ahụ.
He left.	Ọ pụọ.
Great combat mode.	Nnukwu ọnọdụ ọgụ.
Patients cannot tell us what they want.	Ndị ọrịa enweghị ike ịgwa anyị ihe ha chọrọ.
Which would be the same here.	Kedu nke ga-abụ otu ebe a.
They can not talk.	Ha enweghị ike ikwu okwu.
But he still loves her.	Ma ọ ka hụrụ ya n’anya.
The price of the store is reasonable.	Ụgwọ ụlọ ahịa ahụ nwere ezi uche.
He is the head.	Ọ bụ onye isi.
In one of them, he died.	N'ime ha, ọ nwụrụ.
It could easily have been mine.	Ọ nwere ike ịbụ nke m n'ụzọ dị mfe.
I do not want to see it.	Achọghị m ịhụ ya.
But who knows.	Mana onye maara.
They are well versed in books.	Ha maara akwụkwọ nke ọma.
But let me see.	Ma ka m hụ .
But it did happen to me.	Ma o mechara mee m.
Now.	Ugbu a.
That worked for about a minute.	Nke ahụ na-arụ ọrụ ihe dị ka otu nkeji.
He is very happy.	Obi dị ya ụtọ nke ukwuu.
I would love to be here and see this.	Enwere m mmasị ịnọ ebe a wee hụ ihe a.
He did something very different.	O mere nnọọ ihe dị iche.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
It just doesn't go around it.	Ọ dịghị nnọọ na-aga gburugburu ya.
So the diner got a job.	Ya mere, onye na-eri nri nwetara ọrụ.
I can think of a few ways it can be done.	Enwere m ike iche ụzọ ole na ole enwere ike isi mee ya.
It talks about our group.	Ọ na-ekwu ihe gbasara otu anyị.
If you are, it will not be.	Ọ bụrụ na ị bụ, ọ gaghị adị.
They arrived at their destination.	Ha rutere ebe ha na-aga.
But that is my hope.	Ma nke ahụ bụ olileanya m.
It was scary.	Ọ gbara egwu.
I saw what he was going to do last night.	Ahụrụ m ihe ọ ga-eme n'abalị ụnyaahụ.
That is why it is so different.	Ọ bụ ya mere o ji dị iche.
This may be their best meal today.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ nri kacha mma ha taa.
We should know.	Anyị kwesịrị ịma.

But the questions are different.	Ma ajụjụ ndị ahụ dị iche.
I am a valuable girl, and life is only long.	Abụ m nwa agbọghọ bara uru, na ndụ dị naanị ogologo.
First, it is impossible.	Nke mbụ, ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
Maybe they were on their way.	Ma eleghị anya, ha nọ na-aga n'ụzọ ahụ.
Once you get it, they will want money.	Ozugbo ị nwetara ya, ha ga-achọ ego.
He approached.	Ọ gara nso.

There are two policemen there.	Enwere ndị uwe ojii abụọ ebe ahụ.
For people with such problems.	Maka ndị nwere nsogbu dị otú a.

The effect is dramatic.	Mmetụta dị egwu.
Yesterday he would be able to think, to plan.	Ụnyaahụ ọ ga-enwe ike iche echiche, ime atụmatụ.
You just got yourself to blame.	Naanị ị nwetara onwe gị ụta.
We do not know for tomorrow.	Anyị amaghị maka echi.
But let's stop there.	Ma ka anyị kwụsị ebe ahụ.
Feelings and everything around you are good.	Mmetụta na ihe niile gbara gị gburugburu dị mma.
Not one of them.	Ọ bụghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha.
There are many bad languages.	E nwere ọtụtụ asụsụ ọjọọ.
I'm honest.	Adị m eziokwu.
You will not find the family you are looking for.	Ị gaghị ahụ ezinụlọ ị na-achọ.
Of course sometimes he does not know.	N'ezie mgbe ụfọdụ ọ bụghị na ọ maghị.
We love your message.	Anyị hụrụ ozi gị n'anya.
He spoke every word.	O kwuru okwu ọ bụla.
You probably know a lot about them.	O yiri ka ị maara ọtụtụ ihe banyere ha.
He runs back and forth.	Ọ na-agba n'azụ na n'ihu.
Maybe that’s none of this.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ bụla n'ime ihe a.
Otherwise.	Ma ọ bụghị.
It's different so it's higher.	Ọ dị iche na ya mere elu.
It just happens.	Ọ na-eme nnọọ.
He said the money was stolen.	O kwuru na e zuru ego ahụ.
She was a confident, but weak girl.	Ọ bụ nwa agbọghọ nwere obi ike, mana adịghị ike.
This is the first time they have met.	Nke a bụ nke mbụ ha zutere.
No one knows us.	Ọ dịghị onye maara anyị.

Maybe three times.	Ma eleghị anya, ugboro atọ.
I am the head of the house.	Abụ m onye isi n'ụlọ m.
One day, it may be you.	Otu ụbọchị, ọ nwere ike ịbụ gị.
The one that seemed happy a few days ago.	Onye ahụ nke yiri obi ụtọ ụbọchị ole na ole gara aga.
He gave her a long look.	O nyere ya anya ogologo.
It's a short time.	Ọ dị obere oge.
That will still happen.	Nke ahụ ka ga-eme.
Her father really liked her.	Ọ masịrị nna ya nke ukwuu.
Or when they did, it was to say how it was different.	Ma ọ bụ mgbe ha mere, ọ bụ ikwu otú o si dị iche.
I do not understand this.	Aghọtaghị m ihe a.
We are better than they are.	Anyị ka ha mma.
Should have a very good chance next year.	Kwesịrị inwe ohere ịdị mma nke ukwuu n'afọ ọzọ.
But he did not want to.	Ma ọ chọghị.
My mother told me a funny story about my birth.	Nne m gwara m akụkọ na-atọ ọchị gbasara ọmụmụ m.
Can't get out of that.	Enweghị ike ịpụ na nke ahụ.
Not used by myself.	Ejighị ya n'onwe m.
Different days, one night.	Ụbọchị dị iche iche, otu abalị.
It is the choice of most women.	Ọ bụ oke nke ọtụtụ nwanyị.
It is just the way it is.	Ọ bụ nnọọ otú ọ dị.
I come here with sincerity.	Eji m ezi obi bịa ebe a.
According to the idea, sleep knows them.	Dị ka echiche, ụra maara ha.
They will not be there to help us.	Ha agaghị anọ ebe ahụ inyere anyị aka.
But that was all in the past.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe niile n'oge gara aga.
However, there are basic feelings of interest.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere mmetụta ndị bụ isi nke mmasị.
I do nothing.	Anaghị m eme ihe ọ bụla.
Many of them said the same thing.	Ọtụtụ n’ime ha kwuru otu ihe ahụ.
There are many unknowns.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe amaghị ama.
I think that's really good.	Echere m na nke ahụ dị mma n'ezie.
People in your group.	Ndị nọ na otu gị.
Tell them that you did what they said.	Gwa ha na i mere ihe ha kwuru.
But you long.	Ma ị ogologo oge.
Beautiful house.	Ụlọ mara mma.
The film may still be in it.	Ihe nkiri ahụ ka nwere ike ịdị na ya.

It's just a good place.	Ọ bụ naanị ezigbo ebe a.
We gave ourselves the best three or four months.	Anyị nyere onwe anyị ọnwa atọ ma ọ bụ anọ kacha mma.
Or at least that is how it is.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
Despite the inconvenience, she was amazed at her courage.	N'agbanyeghị ụdị nsogbu ahụ, obi ike ya tụrụ ya n'anya.
Someone I thought left a while ago.	Onye m chere hapụrụ nwa oge gara aga.
Whatever the cause, it is bad.	Ihe ọ bụla kpatara gị, ọ dị njọ.
Should have it.	Kwesịrị inwe ya.
They never said that.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha kwuru banyere nke ahụ.
Best of all, good, you have a lot to do.	Ọ kacha mma, ezigbo, ị nwere ọtụtụ ihe ị ga-eme.
How does that affect you?	Kedu ka nke ahụ si eme gị.
The reason for this is obvious.	Ihe kpatara nke a doro anya.
How did we do?	Olee otú anyị mere?
Practice is good all the time.	Omume dị mma n'oge niile.
Another way.	Ụzọ ọzọ.
That would be really bad.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ihe ọjọọ n'ezie.
The spirit is happy that we love each other.	Mmụọ na-enwe obi ụtọ na anyị hụrụ ibe anyị n'anya.
This would not be ideal for any energy project.	Nke a agaghị adị mma maka oke ọrụ ike ọ bụla.
My boat is a place of law.	Ụgbọ mmiri m bụ ebe iwu.
A little over a year ago.	Obere ihe karịrị otu afọ gara aga.

Now that would be a real challenge.	Ugbu a nke ahụ ga-abụ ezigbo ihe ịma aka.
That is my opinion.	Nke ahụ bụ echiche nke m.
I can be helped.	Enwere ike inyere m aka.
He loves it.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya.
But there is something else that works here.	Mana enwere ihe ọzọ na-arụ ọrụ ebe a.
There are many ways to use it.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụzọ eji eme ihe.
However, there is a way around this.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ụzọ gburugburu nke a.
Now if you like it, fine.	Ugbu a ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị, ọ dị mma.
And as he says.	Na dị ka ọ na-ekwu.
It's hard to eat anything.	O siri ike rie ihe ọ bụla.
Now wait a second here.	Ugbu a chere nke abụọ ebe a.
What do you have to say about that ?.	Kedu ihe ị nwere ikwu maka nke ahụ?.
These are our favorite shoes of all time.	Ndị a bụ akpụkpọ ụkwụ kacha amasị anyị mgbe ọ bụla.
When that happens, you will be in your head, real.	Mgbe nke ahụ mere, ị ga-anọ n'isi gị, ezigbo.

There is a special value for good students.	Enwere ọnụ ahịa pụrụ iche maka ezigbo ụmụ akwụkwọ.
They say that kids were fascinated at the time.	Ha na-ekwu na ụmụaka na-enwe mmasị n'oge ahụ.
You ask why they are so special.	Ị jụrụ ihe mere ha ji bụrụ ndị pụrụ iche.
A very good actor.	Onye na-eme ihe nkiri mara oke mma.
But it will not be seen.	Ma a gaghị ahụ ya.
He said he did not like the game.	O kwuru na egwuregwu ahụ anaghị amasị ya.
Then the journalist.	Mgbe ahụ onye nta akụkọ.
He will be a father.	Ọ ga-abụ nna.
That would be nice, you know.	Nke ahụ ga-adị mma, ị maara.
It works well.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Most of you can't.	Ọtụtụ ndị ị nweghị ike.
Not a small task.	Ọ bụghị obere ọrụ.
He was there to do it.	Ọ nọ n'ebe ahụ ka ọ ga-eme ya.
Ships can carry a large number of people at once.	Ụgbọ mmiri nwere ike ibu ọtụtụ mmadụ ozugbo.
He had a funny face.	O nwere ihu ọchị.
He was not dressed, he was honest.	O yighị uwe, o kwuru eziokwu.
This problem is very important to me.	Nsogbu a dị m ezigbo mkpa.

There are some simple steps we can take.	O nwere ihe ụfọdụ dị mfe anyị nwere ike ime.
We found it beautiful, too.	Anyị hụrụ ka ọ mara mma, kwa.
But we know what is happening.	Ma anyị maara ihe na-eme n'ezie.

Of course, it just looks different.	N'ezie, ọ dị nnọọ ka ọ dị iche.
This can be done several times.	Enwere ike ime nke a ọtụtụ ugboro.
He did not want to, he thought.	Ọ chọghị, o chere.
However, it is beautiful.	Otú ọ dị, ọ mara mma.
This is my new story.	Nke a bụ akụkọ ọhụrụ m.

There are two main reasons for the changes.	E nwere ihe abụọ mere a ga-eji mee otú ahụ.

Drinking water almost immediately swallowed it.	Mmiri ọṅụṅụ fọrọ nke nta ka mmiri rie ya ozugbo.
But there they were.	Ma n'ebe ahụ ka ha nọ.
Every day, very few children go to school.	Kwa ụbọchị, ụmụaka ole na ole na-aga ụlọ akwụkwọ.
He should be ready immediately.	O kwesịrị ịdị njikere ngwa ngwa.

Amazing things are happening.	Ihe ndị dị egwu na-eme.

I was not there.	Anọghị m ebe ahụ.
What is he doing now? 	Kedu ihe ọ na-eme ugbu a?
We should not talk about that.	Anyị ekwesịghị ikwu banyere nke ahụ.

He said it was cold.	O kwuru na oyi na-atụ.
I have a plan.	Enwere m atụmatụ.
In situations like this, you know.	Na ọnọdụ ndị dị otú a, ị maara.
Would that be a good way ?.	Nke ahụ ọ ga-abụ ụzọ dị mma?.
Their children hate them.	Ụmụ ha kpọrọ ha asị.
No problem.	Enweghị nsogbu ọ bụla.
And each user has one.	Na onye ọrụ ọ bụla nwere otu.
Some books are ancient.	Ụfọdụ akwụkwọ bụ oge ochie.
For staying here.	Maka ịnọ ebe a.
This is not good.	Nke a adịghị mma.
Next to two trees going forward.	N'akụkụ osisi abụọ na-aga n'ihu.
However, the design scheme is only available for a few plant species.	Otú ọ dị, atụmatụ atụmatụ dị naanị maka ụdị osisi ole na ole.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ọ bụ naanị okwu oge.
Most of the passengers were students.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị njem ahụ bụ ụmụ akwụkwọ.
But that is the best thing we can do now.	Mana nke ahụ bụ ihe kacha mma anyị nwere ike ime ugbu a.
Inside, his mind was running.	N'ime, uche ya na-agba ọsọ.
If anyone needs to rest, it is you.	Ọ bụrụ na onye ọ bụla kwesịrị izu ike, ọ bụ gị.
For others.	Maka ndị ọzọ.
We still need you.	Anyị ka chọrọ gị.
Extremely high for last year.	Oke oke dị elu maka afọ gara aga.
The room has three bedrooms.	Ụlọ ahụ nwere ọnụ ụlọ atọ.
It sounds like a good idea.	Ọ dị ka ezigbo echiche.
I wonder what else such a good example could be.	M na-eche ihe ọzọ dị otú ahụ ezi ihe atụ nwere ike ịbụ.
Therefore, it is worth it.	Ya mere, kwesịrị ya.
In all rooms.	N'ime ụlọ niile.
I have a temper tantrum.	Enwere m nsogbu iwe.
They are looking for you.	Ha na-achọ gị.
The fact is, it can happen anywhere.	Nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na o nwere ike ime ebe ọ bụla.
I can not.	Enweghị m ike.
He looked around the room.	O lere ọnụ ụlọ ahụ anya.
They can be any type of story you want.	Ha nwere ike ịbụ ụdị akụkọ ọ bụla ịchọrọ.
Teachers, athletes, everything.	Ndị nkuzi, ndị egwuregwu, ihe niile.
I need to get used to it now.	O kwesịrị m mara ya ahụ́ ugbu a.
They are old songs.	Ha bụrụ abụ ochie.
It's not just the head.	Ọ bụghị naanị isi.
I see it every day.	Ana m ahụ ya kwa ụbọchị.
These are the fun times !.	Oge ndị a bụ oge na-atọ ụtọ!.
The theater and its facilities were donated.	E nyere ụlọ ihe nkiri ahụ na ihe ndị e ji eme ihe n'ụlọ ihe nkiri ahụ.
Not by a woman.	Ọ bụghị site na nwanyị.
They just know they are doing it.	Ha maara nnọọ na ha na-eme ya.
I do this by my side.	M na-eme nke a n'akụkụ m.
But they come quickly.	Ma ha na-abịa ngwa ngwa.
That's what they do most.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ha kacha eme.
Make it appropriate for yourself.	Mee ya ka o kwesịrị maka onwe gị.
They are simple, and beautiful.	Ha dị mfe, ma mara mma.
Some are as important today as they were then.	Ụfọdụ ka dị mkpa taa dị ka ọ dị na mbụ.
The fighting lasted more than an hour.	Ọgụ ahụ were ihe karịrị otu awa.
However, this would be a problem in my life.	Otú ọ dị, nke a ga-abụ nsogbu ná ndụ m.
Simple life appeals to everyone.	Ndụ dị mfe na-amasị onye ọ bụla.
But that is a thing of the past and this is the present.	Mana nke ahụ bụ ihe gara aga na nke a bụ ugbu a.
He looked at it carefully.	O lere ya anya nke ọma.
I am very happy to be a helper.	Obi dị m ụtọ nke ukwuu ịbụ onye enyemaka.
Well, it's not just one of the workers.	Ọ dị mma, ọ bụghị naanị otu ndị ọrụ ka kpatara ya.
As a rule of thumb small eyes.	Dị ka iwu nke ịdị ukwuu obere anya.
It works well.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
We were very scared.	Anyị tụrụ egwu nke ukwuu.
Do what you can.	Mee ihe i nwere ike ime.
But he did not know how long he had to wait.	Ma ọ maghị oge ole o nwere.
We expect the best.	Anyị na-atụ anya ihe kacha mma.
He got sick when he was a child.	Ọ dara ọrịa mgbe ọ bụ nwata.
But three others.	Ma atọ ndị ọzọ .
Money will not do.	Ego agaghị eme.
The people there.	Ndị bi n’ebe ahụ nọ.
It was the last thing he said to her.	Ọ bụ ihe ikpeazụ ọ gwara ya.
It makes me laugh.	Ọ na-eme m ihe ọchị.
But now there is no place to run.	Ma, n'oge a, e nweghị ebe ịgba ọsọ.
It's great.	Ọ mara oke mma.
You can be serious.	Ị nwere ike ịdị njọ.
The information is very important.	Ozi ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa.
It may not be.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị adị.
That is the important thing.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe dị mkpa.
Swimming is his favorite activity.	Igwu mmiri bụ ihe omume kacha amasị ya.
I like books very much.	Akwụkwọ na-amasị m nke ukwuu.
And who knows, maybe they'll go.	Na onye maara, ma eleghị anya, ha ga-aga.
He did not know whether it was anger or fear.	Ọ maghị ma ọ bụ iwe ma ọ bụ egwu.
Many left.	Ọtụtụ ndị hapụrụ ebe ahụ.
In this form.	Na ụdị a.
My hand is like fire.	Aka m dị ka ọkụ.
We do a great team.	Anyị na-eme nnukwu otu.
The second statement is similar.	Okwu nke abụọ yiri ya.
The frightening power of this man expected.	Ike ụjọ nke nwoke a tụrụ anya.
It is really beautiful.	Ọ mara mma n'ezie.
What really happened.	Gịnị mere n'ezie.
I think it's good.	Echere m na ọ dị mma.
Where life is good.	Ebe ndụ ndụ dị mma.
This is their chance.	Nke a bụ ohere ha.
There are many awesome law schools out there.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụlọ akwụkwọ iwu dị egwu dị n'ebe ahụ.
I am, you know.	Abụ m onwe m, ka ị mara.
All that matters is what a child can do.	Ihe niile dị mkpa bụ nwa nwere ike ime.
This is a bad day.	Nke a bụ ụbọchị ọjọọ ya.
I leave it to you.	M hapụrụ gị ya.
Maybe a little.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị ntakịrị.
Without goodness.	Na-enweghị ịdị mma.
The idea is really beautiful.	Echiche mara mma n'ezie.
He did not want to give them a chance.	Ọ chọghị inye ha ohere ime olileanya ya.
However, this is very different.	Otú ọ dị, nke a bụ nnọọ iche.
In his name, and where he goes to school.	Na aha ya, na ebe ọ na-aga akwụkwọ.
So he has.	Ya mere o nwere.
And so on.	Na ihe ọzọ.
And after the last thing the night before bed.	Na mgbe ikpeazụ ihe n'abalị tupu ụra.
His family did not know anything about him.	Ezinụlọ ya amaghị nke ọ bụla.
And in some ways, it does.	Na n'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ọ na-eme.
There are benefits for the mother.	Enwere uru maka nne.
Obviously this is my life.	O doro anya na nke a bụ ndụ m.
I will do it if you want me to do so.	M ga-eme ya ma ọ bụrụ na ị ga-achọ ka m mee otú ahụ.
Your doctor should know these things.	Dọkịta gị kwesịrị ịma ihe ndị a.
I'm sorry.	Ọ dị m nwute.
But he could have known them.	Ma ọ gaara ama ha.
He doesn't seem to hear me.	Ọ dị ka ọ naghị anụ m.
However, it does not matter that date.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mkpa ụbọchị ahụ.
Three of the four places are very beautiful.	Atọ n'ime anọ ebe a mara ezigbo mma.
Police entered the building.	Ndị uwe ojii banyere n'ụlọ ahụ.
I told you about that myself.	M gwara gị gbasara nke ahụ n'onwe m.
All members here.	Ndị otu niile ebe a.
Maybe two such things can make a game better.	Ma eleghị anya, abụọ dị otú ahụ nwere ike ime ka egwuregwu dị mma.
The filming is really good.	Ime ihe nkiri ahụ dị mma n'ezie.
We can't be rural right now.	Anyị enweghị ike ime obodo ugbu a.
I care about them.	M na-eche banyere ha.
That is the power of forgiveness.	Nke ahụ bụ ike mgbaghara.
This is so much greater than we are.	Nke a dị nnọọ ukwuu karịa anyị.
You know when.	Ị maara mgbe.
This is what they were told.	Nke a bụ ihe a gwara ha.
You can’t see a bigger name than that.	Ị nweghị ike ịhụ nnukwu aha karịa nke ahụ.
He cried out.	Mkpu dara ya.
There on time, any time.	N'ebe ahụ n'oge, oge ọ bụla.
Obviously, that is impossible.	O doro anya na nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume.
He had a job, but was like.	O nwere ọrụ, ma dị ka ya.
This plant is known for its medicinal benefits.	A maara osisi a maka uru ọgwụ ya.
I know her husband well.	Ama m di ya nke ọma.
A little old but still important.	Obere ochie mana ka dị mkpa.
People do not like the truth.	Eziokwu adịghị amasị ndị mmadụ.
Therefore, they can believe.	Ya mere, ha nwere ike kwere.
I can't be smart.	Enweghị m ike ịbụ onye maara ihe.
They are more independent than we are.	Ha nwere onwe karịa anyị.
From a distance, it seemed small and distant.	Site n'ebe dị anya, ọ dị ka obere na ebe dị anya.
The most likely success is going home.	O yikarịrị ka ịga nke ọma bụ ịla n'ụlọ.
You are not a commodity.	Ị bụghị ngwa ahịa.
Or it is.	Ma ọ bụ ọ bụ.
This is your family.	Nke a bụ ezinụlọ gị.
They want men.	Ọ bụ ụmụ nwoke ka ha chọrọ.
That happened in two.	Nke ahụ mere abụọ.
They are on our right, on the road.	Ha nọ n'akụkụ aka nri anyị, n'ụzọ.
The prices are reasonable.	Ọnụ ego ndị ahụ nwere ezi uche.
Let me tell you what I like.	Ka m gwa gị ihe na-atọ m ụtọ.
So let me give you an example.	Ya mere, ka m nye gị ihe atụ.
This is not true.	Nke a abụghị eziokwu.
Sometimes he will be a good customer.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ọ ga-abụ ezigbo ndị ahịa.
They have children.	Ha nwere ụmụaka.
Please can you stay here.	Biko ị nwere ike nọrọ ebe a.
They are no different than we were when they were alive.	Ha adịghị iche karịa anyị mgbe ha dị ndụ.
Obviously, of course.	O doro anya, n'ezie.
It looks like they have you.	Ọ dị ka ha nwere gị.
My father burned it, you see.	Nna m gbara ya ọkụ, ị hụ.
It is good to eat that.	Ọ dị mma iri nke ahụ.
Everything seemed logical to him.	Ihe niile yiri ihe ezi uche dị na ya n'anya ya.
No power or no power.	Enweghị ike ma ọ bụ enweghị ike.
I don’t do any of these things.	Anaghị m eme nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a.
Nothing was left out.	Ọ dịghị ihe hapụrụ ya.
But not like you.	Ma ọ bụghị dị ka gị.
Some emotions are positive.	Ụfọdụ mmetụta dị mma.
Then we.	Mgbe ahụ anyị.

Needless to say.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
Again and again and again.	Ugboro ugboro ugboro ugboro.
There is something wrong.	Ọ nwere ihe adịghị mma.
I am a mother.	Abụ m nne.

He was only 12 at the time.	Ọ dị naanị afọ iri na abụọ n’oge ahụ.
I do not know what you are talking about.	Amaghị m ihe ị na-ekwu.
Really, really hard.	N'ezie, n'ezie ike ike.
Only everyone knows who likes cooking.	Naanị onye ọ bụla maara onye na-amasị isi nri.
Just get angry.	Naanị were iwe.
One man can.	Otu nwoke nwere ike.
I want to leave.	Achọrọ m ịpụ.
But it is better at night.	Mana ọ ka mma n'abalị.
That is about me.	Nke ahụ bụ gbasara m.
What do you say about your lack of success?	Kedu ihe ị na-ekwu na enweghị ihe ịga nke ọma gị?
I say only what it is.	M na-ekwu naanị ihe bụ.
They are both very beautiful.	Ha abụọ mara ezigbo mma.
I do not feel like I am doing that.	Ọ naghị adị m ka ọ bụ m na-eme ihe ahụ.
Doing good is not so fun !.	Ime ihe ọma adịghị atọ ụtọ otú ahụ!.
He is still sitting there.	Ọ ka nọ ọdụ ebe ahụ.
To provide customers with a drink.	Iji nye ndị ahịa ihe ọṅụṅụ.
His time will come.	Oge ya ga-abịa.
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
For a long time, too.	Ruo ogologo oge, kwa.
He may have died instantly.	O nwere ike ịbụ na ọ nwụrụ ozugbo.
I don't want to be here.	Achọghị m ịnọ ebe a.
I feel I need it.	Enwere m mmetụta na ọ dị m mkpa.
Pretty much everyone.	Mara mma onye ọ bụla.
I do not know anything else.	Amaghị m ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
We will do it that day.	Anyị ga-eme ya ụbọchị ahụ.
This is our opportunity.	Nke a bụ ohere anyị.
Please wait here.	Biko chere ebe a.
All required.	Ihe niile chọrọ.
The price is too high.	Ọnụ ahịa dị oke oke.
I don't like that place.	Ọ naghị amasị m ebe ahụ.
Everything is an example of something.	Ihe niile bụ ihe atụ nke ihe.
For dining, the restaurant has a restaurant and bar restaurant.	Maka iri nri, ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ nwere ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ na ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
They have their own agenda.	Ha nwere ihe nke ha na-aga.

He made himself as a man.	O mere onwe ya ka mmadụ.
They make the problem worse.	Ha na-eme ka nsogbu ahụ ka njọ.
His mother, his father.	Nne ya, nna ya.
This is pretty much all that is expected.	A mara mma nke ukwuu ihe niile echere.
To get it.	Iji nweta ya.
Please wait, she told herself.	Biko chere, ọ gwara onwe ya.
I am with my sister.	Mụ na nwanne m nwanyị nọ.
Our view seems to be very different.	Echiche anyị yiri ka ọ dị nnọọ iche.
Many students are interested in it.	Ọtụtụ ụmụ akwụkwọ nwere mmasị na ya.
You frighten me.	Ị na-atụ m ụjọ.
You want everyone to be happy.	Ị chọrọ ka mmadụ niile nwee obi ụtọ.
We are not free to speak here.	Anyị enweghị onwe anyị ikwu okwu ebe a.
That's what he said.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe o kwuru.
But what he said was true.	Ma ihe ọ ka kwuru bụ eziokwu.
You are alone for information.	Ị nọ naanị gị maka ozi.
She bought a new dress.	Ọ zụtara uwe ọhụrụ.
We have no way of knowing who you are.	Anyị agaghị enwe ụzọ mara onye ị bụ.
It went on for hours.	Ọ gara n'ihu ruo ọtụtụ awa.
They cannot believe their eyes.	Ha apụghị ikweta anya ha.
That requires two things.	Nke ahụ chọrọ ihe abụọ.
I want beauty.	Achọrọ m ịma mma.
The latter is clearly about user success.	Nke ikpeazụ bụ n'ụzọ doro anya banyere ihe ịga nke ọma onye ọrụ.
It will not be.	A gaghị enwe ya.
This is known.	Nke a mara okwu.
He was never violent.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-eme ihe ike.

And you have a lot of beautiful people in this.	Na ị nwere ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ mara mma na nke a.
I don't care now.	Achọghị m ịma ugbu a.
The client plans to go abroad.	Onye ahịa ahụ mere atụmatụ ịga mba ọzọ.
It is better to be ready.	Ọ ka mma ịdị njikere.
I am at rest.	Anọ m n'ụlọ ezumike.
Your life itself.	Ndụ gị n'onwe ya.
That pretty much what it is.	Nke ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu ihe ọ bụ.
What you did was wrong.	Ihe i mere adịghị mma.
He allowed it.	O kwere ya.
How the mothers did more than I did.	Otu ndị nne siri mee ihe karịrị m.
This event happened alone.	Ihe omume a mere naanị.
Now only you can tell me.	Ugbu a naanị gị nwere ike ịgwa m.
There are no colored people.	Enweghị ndị nwere agba.
That caused a little trouble.	Nke ahụ kpatara ntakịrị nsogbu.
I fell asleep a little.	Ahụrụ m ụra ntakịrị.
I am everything, he said.	Abụ m ihe niile, o kwuru.
That is your job.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ gị.
He looked at her for a moment.	O lere ya anya nwa oge.
It's me.	Ọ bụ m.
Not good.	Ọ bụghị mma.
Now I want to play this new game.	Ugbu a achọrọ m igwu egwuregwu ọhụrụ a.
Get a new car.	Nweta ụgbọala ọhụrụ.
As soon as he could, he left the bar.	Ozugbo o nwere ike, ọ hapụrụ ụlọ mmanya ahụ.
Take the door on the other side.	Were ọnụ ụzọ n'akụkụ nke ọzọ.
More than anything else, because it is impossible.	Karịa ihe ọ bụla ọzọ, n'ihi na ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
This is not a bad thing.	Nke a abụghị ihe ọjọọ.
You see, I did not do this.	Ị hụrụ, ọ bụghị m mere ihe a.
Only three women and two men.	Naanị ụmụ nwanyị atọ na ụmụ nwoke abụọ.
I like these things very much.	Ihe ndị a na-amasị m nke ukwuu.
We need to know what happened.	Anyị kwesịrị ịma ihe merenụ.
Many things could have happened then.	Ọtụtụ ihe gaara eme n'oge ahụ.
It's very good.	Ọ dị nnọọ mma.
I know it.	Amaara m ka ọ dị.
Most of them have children.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha nwere ụmụ.
It looks so pretty now.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu ugbu a.
He saw her for the first time.	Ọ hụrụ ya na nke mbụ ya.
The house is not going anywhere.	Ụlọ ahụ agaghị ebe ọ bụla.
Work should be work and home should be home.	Ọrụ kwesịrị ịbụ ọrụ na ụlọ kwesịrị ịbụ ụlọ.
I am going now.	Ana m aga ugbu a.
Taken as a whole, nothing is perfect.	E were ya na oke, ihe ọ bụla adịghị mma.
I did not think anything of it.	Echeghị m ihe ọ bụla banyere ya.
I am traveling fast.	Ana m eme njem ọkụ.
Again.	Ọzọ.
But we have no value.	Ma anyị enweghị uru ọ bụla.
It’s good and it works.	Ọ dị mma ma ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
They just want time.	Ha na-achọ naanị oge.
At first, about ten days ago, they gave us a lot of trouble.	Na mbụ, ihe dị ka ụbọchị iri gara aga, ha nyere anyị ọtụtụ nsogbu.
What could that be ?.	Kedu ihe nke ahụ nwere ike ịdị?.
Somehow, it is.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ọ bụ.
This soon.	Nke a n'oge adịghị anya.
However, it is more than that.	Otú ọ dị, ọ karịrị nke ahụ.
I know what many of you think.	Amaara m ihe ọtụtụ n'ime unu na-eche.
I feel like life is so beautiful.	Ọ dị m ka ndụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
And again.	Na kwa ọzọ.
She plans to do it again at some point.	Ọ na-eme atụmatụ ime ọzọ n'oge ụfọdụ.
Of course, both can work.	N'ezie, ha abụọ nwere ike na-arụ ọrụ.
This method is good.	Ụzọ a dị mma.
Often, it is read by thread.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, a na-agụ ya site na eri.
The plans are beautiful.	Atụmatụ ndị ahụ mara mma.
He has a complete problem with the book.	O nwere nsogbu zuru oke na akwụkwọ.
It's very simple, this.	Ọ dị oke mfe, nke a.
As a rule.	Dị ka iwu.
It is a case.	Ọ bụ ikpe.
He did not know how to run.	Ọ maghị ụzọ ọ ga-esi agba ọsọ.
Others did not.	Ndị ọzọ emeghị.
We do a lot of things there.	Anyị na-eme ọtụtụ ihe n'ebe ahụ.
But your father and mother are special cases.	Ma nna gị na nne gị bụ ikpe pụrụ iche.
Not a good photo.	Ọ bụghị foto dị mma.
And imagine it was beautiful.	Na iche na ọ mara mma.
But he is not afraid.	Ma ọ dịghị atụ egwu ya.
I do not want to say it twice.	Achọghị m ikwu ya ugboro abụọ.
He travels to many cities every day.	Ọ na-aga ọtụtụ obodo kwa ụbọchị.
The faster, the better.	Ngwa ngwa, ka mma.
Each of your relatives.	Onye ọ bụla n'ime ndị ikwu gị.
If you leave now, you can't do that in danger.	Ọ bụrụ na ị pụọ ugbu a, ị nweghị ike ime nke ahụ n'ihe egwu.
Children like it do not.	Ụmụaka dị ka ya adịghị.
So far, however, this has not been the case.	Otú ọ dị, ruo ugbu a nke a abụghị ikpe.
Cook until egg thick.	Esi nri ruo mgbe akwa akwa.
In the extreme, no one can talk to another.	N'ime nke ukwuu, ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ịgwa onye ọzọ okwu.
You cannot do this.	Ị gaghị eme nke a.
It happens here and there.	Ọ na-eme ebe a na ebe ahụ.
We feared the worst.	Anyị tụrụ egwu nke kacha njọ.
For some reason that is not a good idea.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ nke ahụ abụghị ezigbo echiche.
The car made it easy.	Ụgbọ ala mere ka ọ dị mfe.
We do it on both sides.	Anyị na-eme ya n'akụkụ abụọ.
Maybe you don’t.	Ma eleghị anya, ị naghị eme ya.
You will not allow.	Ị gaghị ekwe.
He frightened them.	Ọ tụrụ ha egwu.
He had some problems before.	O nwere nsogbu ụfọdụ tupu mgbe ahụ.
I say this for a reason.	M na-ekwu nke a maka otu ihe kpatara ya.
We will do our best with what we have been given.	Anyị ga-eji ihe e nyere anyị mee ike anyị niile.
The passenger got angry.	Onye njem ahụ were iwe.
He had a problem last year, he said.	O nwere nsogbu n'afọ gara aga, o kwuru.
I think that would be a problem.	Echere m na nke ahụ ga-abụ nsogbu.
At this point, you are not going to do anything about it.	N'oge a, ị gaghị eme ihe ọ bụla na ya.
Water is liquid.	Mmiri bụ mmiri mmiri.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
I'm not sure which one.	Ejighị m n'aka nke ọ bụ.
He told you to tell me.	Ọ gwara gị ka i wee gwa m.
He loves her and wants her.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya chọrọ ya.
But there is more on the horizon.	Ma a ka nwere ihe ọzọ ga-abịa.
He certainly loves them.	N'ezie, ọ hụrụ ya n'anya ha.
He never wanted to be.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ chọrọ ịbụ.
But again maybe not.	Ma ọzọ eleghị anya ọ bụghị.
Both are locals.	Abụọ bụ ndị obodo.
But basically, we did nothing.	Ma n'ụzọ bụ isi, ọ dịghị ihe anyị mere.
Tell us your problems.	Gwa anyị nsogbu gị.
Then he saw a well-known hypocrite.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ hụrụ ihu abụọ maara nke ọma.
Let his head.	Ka isi ya.
Or, at least he had no choice in the matter.	Ma ọ bụ, ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ o nwere, ọ dịghị mgbe ọ jụrụ ya.
Things will not go your way.	Ihe agaghị aga n'ụzọ gị.
Think you can help me with this.	Chere na ị nwere ike inyere m aka na nke a.
It is very strange.	Ọ bụ nnọọ anya.
Or is it.	Ma ọ bụ ya.
I can't find anything better.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ihe ka mma.
Good day and bad.	Nke ọma ụbọchị na ọjọọ.
On the other hand, he was sentenced to life in prison.	N'aka nke ọzọ, a mara ya ikpe ịga mkpọrọ ndụ.
Great unemployment.	Nnukwu enweghị ọrụ.
I like information.	Ozi na-amasị m.
There are no questions about that.	Enweghị ajụjụ gbasara nke ahụ.

The woman stopped and was terrified.	Nwanyị ahụ kwụsịrị, ụjọ tụrụ ya.
Maybe it looks like yours.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị ka nke gị.
It’s like a job.	Ọ dị ka ọrụ ndụ.

For many people.	Maka ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ.
No one in the house is nice.	O nweghị onye nọ n'ụlọ ahụ dị mma.

Some people are afraid to go out at night alone.	Ụfọdụ ndị na-atụ ụjọ ịga naanị ha n’abalị.
When we did that.	Mgbe anyị mere ihe ahụ.
Heads are power.	Ndị isi bụ ike.
I do not want it to be bad.	Achọghị m ịma ka ọ dị njọ.

They made it baby.	Nwa ka ha mere ya.
He was stopped by a police officer for speeding.	Otu onye uwe ojii kwụsịrị ya maka ịgba ọsọ ọsọ.

The house is, if anything, worse than a pet house.	Ụlọ ahụ bụ, ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla, dị njọ karịa ụlọ anụ ụlọ.
They are very friendly.	Ha yiri nnọọ enyi na enyi.
Horrible hunger in the girl.	Agụụ dị egwu na nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
The building has only three floors.	Ụlọ ahụ nwere naanị ala atọ.
It is useful for important reasons.	Ọ bara uru maka ihe kpatara ya dị mkpa.
We thought it was something special.	Anyị chere na ọ bụ ihe pụrụ iche.
So much the better.	Otú ahụ ka mma.
Not the best idea.	Ọ bụghị echiche kacha mma.
Every customer will be different.	Onye ahịa ọ bụla ga-adị iche.
Nothing happens within the time you want.	Ọ dịghị ihe na-eme n'ime oge ị chọrọ.
I'm too bad.	Adị m njọ nke ukwuu.
Most of us are very pretty.	Ọtụtụ n'ime anyị mara ezigbo mma.
His body was, in fact, dead.	Ahụ ya n'ezie, nwụrụ anwụ.
To get this opportunity, you have to be fast.	Iji nweta ohere a, ị ga-adị ngwa ngwa.
The person has a very beautiful couple photo.	Onye ahụ nwere foto di na nwunye mara mma nke ukwuu.

Maybe we can go there a little longer.	Ma eleghị anya, anyị nwere ike ịga ebe ahụ ntakịrị oge.

Hell of a time.	Ala mmụọ nke oge.
I only came once.	Naanị otu oge ka m bịara.
All is not well.	Ihe niile adịghị mma.
The book is cheap.	Akwụkwọ ahụ dị ọnụ ala.
It works on the amount of energy.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ na ego nke ike.
They are not married.	Ha abụghị di na nwunye.
This will do two things.	Nke a ga-eme ihe abụọ.
That is very beautiful.	Nke ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
This should only take a few minutes at this time.	Nke a kwesịrị iwe naanị nkeji ole na ole n'oge a.
This city will be a spiritual city.	Obodo a ga-abụ obodo mmụọ.
We will succeed in this.	Anyị ga-aga nke ọma na nke a.
I let go of his hand.	M hapụrụ aka ya.
The impact on the company is staggering.	Mmetụta dị na ụlọ ọrụ ahụ dị egwu.
You will not do that.	Ị gaghị eme nke ahụ.
If possible, today itself.	Ọ bụrụ na o kwere omume, taa n'onwe ya.
He had a reason.	O nwere ihe kpatara ya.
I'm not sure about everything.	Adịghị m n'aka maka ihe niile.
Such awesome music he did.	Egwu dị egwu dị otú ahụ o mere.
This is a question of fact.	Nke a bụ ajụjụ nke eziokwu.
We do it a lot.	Anyị na-eme ya nke ukwuu.
They talk about it in a game.	Ha na-ekwu maka ya na egwuregwu.
That is the point.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe.
Should get out.	Kwesịrị ịpụ.
We thought it was probably just his type.	Anyị chere na ọ ga-abụ na ọ bụ naanị ụdị ya.
His stomach ached.	Ahụ́ jụrụ oyi n'afọ ya.
I was waiting for her.	Mụ onwe m nọ na-eche ya.
But as he ran, he began to doubt.	Ma ka ọ na-agba ọsọ, ọ malitere inwe obi abụọ.
That is where he lives.	Ebe ahụ ka o bi.
Their color is the same.	Agba ha bụ otu.
He can eat.	O nwere ike iri nri.
I have been doing that for a few years.	A na m eme nke ahụ afọ ole na ole.
Did you have an accident?	Ị nwere ihe mberede ọ bụla?
There would not have been a better day for him.	Agaraghị enwe ụbọchị ka mma maka ya.
That is a fact.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu n'ezie.
Fear of ignorance.	Ụjọ nke amaghị.
The man suddenly fled.	Nwoke ahụ gbara ọsọ na mberede.
Maybe he got his job because he was beautiful.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ nwetara ọrụ ya n'ihi na ọ mara mma.
I am more or less ready for that.	Adị m njikere karịa ma ọ bụ obere maka nke ahụ.
He does not want us to do it.	Ọ chọghị ka anyị mee ya.
This is true today more than ever.	Nke a bụ eziokwu taa karịa mgbe ọ bụla ọzọ.
We spent the night at a resort.	Anyị nọrọ abalị n'ụlọ ezumike.
He liked it.	O nwere mmasị na ya.
You just have to move on.	Naanị ị ga-aga n'ihu.
It continues throughout the year.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu n'afọ.
I saw something else.	Ahụrụ m ihe ọzọ.
There are currently three people at the airport.	Enwere mmadụ atọ nọ n'ọdụ ụgbọ elu ugbu a.
I feel so much more than that.	Enwere m mmetụta nke ukwuu karịa ka ọ dị otu a.
Now, we can’t give this meat away.	Ugbu a, anyị enweghị ike inye anụ a.
It’s easier said than done, you might say.	Ọ dị mfe ikwu karịa ime, ị nwere ike ikwu.
He was four more years old.	Ọ dị afọ anọ ọzọ.
He did not know this truth.	Ọ maghị eziokwu a.
Any kind of help seems helpful.	Ụdị enyemaka ọ bụla yiri ka ọ bara uru.
You are beautiful tonight.	Ị mara mma n'abalị a.
No doubt we will use it.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na anyị ga-eji ya mee ihe.
The point is what you say.	Isi bụ ihe ị na-ekwu.
He’s a fun guy, but we’re not two good people.	Ọ bụ nwoke na-atọ ụtọ, mana anyị abụghị ezigbo mmadụ abụọ.
Another question comes up.	Ọzọ otu ajụjụ na-abịa.
But no.	Ma ọ dịghị.
But then anger begins.	Ma mgbe ahụ ka iwe malitere.
I bought it because it was different.	M zụtara ya n'ihi na ọ dị iche.
You will love to travel.	Ị ga-enwe mmasị ịga njem.
I see what you are saying.	Ahụrụ m ihe ị na-ekwu.
Someone good at home.	Onye ezi na ụlọ.
There are many.	Enwere ọtụtụ.
Clearly, the word is power.	N'ụzọ doro anya, okwu ahụ bụ nke ike.
I do not know where to go from here.	Amaghị m ebe m ga-esi ebe a gaa.
Now that would be a big name for this project.	Ugbu a nke ahụ ga-abụ nnukwu aha maka ọrụ a.
Not his mother's.	Ọ bụghị nke nne ya.
I can't say another word.	Enweghị m ike ikwu okwu ọzọ.
A few things surprised me.	Ihe ole na ole n'ebe ahụ tụrụ m n'anya.
Of course there is more to it.	N'ezie enwere ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
This happened last week.	Nke a mere n'izu gara aga.
I did nothing.	Emeghị m ihe ọ bụla.
I will do this.	Aga m eme nke a.
The house seems to be better than it was in a few months.	Ụlọ ahụ yiri ka ọ dị mma karịa ka ọ na-eme n'ime ọnwa ole na ole.
One family suffers a lot today.	Otu ezinụlọ na-enwe ọtụtụ nsogbu taa.
Tears welled up in my eyes.	Anya mmiri gbara m n’ihu.
Another two or three minutes would have done it.	Nkeji abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ ọzọ gaara eme ya.
If we don't, we will stay here a long time.	Ọ bụrụ na anyị emeghị, anyị ga-anọ ebe a ogologo oge.
As impossible.	Dị ka ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
Soon, it is easy to see why.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, ọ dị mfe ịhụ ihe kpatara ya.
I know this for a fact.	Amaara m nke a n'ezie.
He is still waiting.	Ọ ka na-eche.
It is a place indoors.	Ọ bụ ebe n'ime ụlọ.
There are different types of beans in the body.	Enwere ụdị agwa dị iche iche n'ime otu ahụ.
I think he does.	Echere m na ọ na-eme ya.
He made a report there.	O mere akụkọ n'ebe ahụ.
You have been looking for something like this for a long time.	Ị na-achọ ihe dị otú a ogologo oge.
You can have more than one feeling.	Ị nwere ike inwe mmetụta karịrị otu.
In this case, the load is very good.	Na nke a, ibu bụ nnọọ mma.
He is afraid.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya.
This will be his room.	Nke a ga-abụ ọnụ ụlọ ya.
He is still alive.	Ọ ka dị ndụ.
But he did so.	Ma o mere otú a.
I can not see them.	Enweghị m ike ihu ha ihu.
Many will not let you do it.	Ọtụtụ agaghị ekwe ka ị mee ya.
To his mother.	Nye nne ya.
Of course more than a few.	N'ezie karịa ole na ole.
They have good reason.	Ha nwere ezi ihe kpatara ya.
We need to find the best way.	Anyị kwesịrị ịchọta ụzọ kacha mma.
Of course we still are.	N'ezie anyị ka na-.
I feel so much better.	Enwere m mmetụta nke ukwuu.
If you expect anything else, you do not know it very well.	Ọ bụrụ na ị tụrụ anya ihe ọ bụla ọzọ, ị maghị ya nke ọma.
Many locals are angry about the proposed company.	Ọtụtụ ndị obodo were iwe maka ụlọ ọrụ a chọrọ.
I do not think much about it.	Echeghị m ọtụtụ ihe banyere ya.
As a child, he was afraid of dogs.	Mgbe ọ bụ nwata, ọ na-atụ nkịta egwu.
They can be anything.	Ha nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọ bụla.
It’s a home office, but it’s very important.	Ọ bụ ụlọ ọrụ ụlọ, mana ọ dị ezigbo mkpa.
Or a car.	Ma ọ bụ ụgbọ ala.
He had no money, he said.	O nweghị ego, o kwuru.
Some countries have a large population.	Ụfọdụ mba nwere nnukwu mmadụ.
It's beautiful, too.	Ọ mara mma, kwa.
I don't like it.	Ọ naghị adị m mma.
Friends are coming.	Ndị enyi na-abịa.
It is not a characteristic of them.	Ọ bụghị ihe e ji mara ha.
This is true.	Nke a bụ eziokwu.
Or really.	Ma ọ bụ n'ezie.
I love sleep.	Ahụrụ m ụra n'anya.
See or see it.	Hụ ma ọ bụ hụ ya.
This is another character.	Nke a bụ agwa ọzọ.
I play well.	M na-egwu nke ọma.
We want this baby in our lives.	Anyị chọrọ nwa a na ndụ anyị.
Everything else is easy to do.	Ihe ndị ọzọ niile dị mfe ime.
There will not be enough work.	Agaghị enwe ọrụ zuru oke.

There is still a silly smile on your face.	A ka nwere ihu ọchị nzuzu na ihu gị.
Still, it is good.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ dị mma.
You can not use it for anything.	Ị nweghị ike iji ya mee ihe ọ bụla.
You will use your resources wisely.	Ị ga-eji ihe i nwere mara ihe.
He does what he wants to do.	Ọ na-eme ihe ọ chọrọ ime.
This is a distant crowd.	Nke a bụ ebe igwe mmadụ dị anya.
It will be difficult.	Ọ ga-esi ike.
Truth, not emotion.	Eziokwu, ọ bụghị mmetụta.
He sang with a song.	O ji otu egwu bụrụ abụ.
One of them is water.	Otu n'ime ha bụ mmiri.
We will spend the weekend there.	Anyị ga-anọ izu ụka ebe ahụ.
One moment please.	Otu oge biko.
But it must be done !.	Mana ekwesịrị ime ya!.
I want it with you.	Achọrọ m ya na ya.
Mothers are male.	Ndị nne na-eme ụmụ nwoke.
The accident happened early in the morning.	Ihe mberede a mere n'isi ụtụtụ.
He knows everything right away.	Ọ maara ihe niile ozugbo.
Not the same person as last week.	Ọ bụghị otu onye dị ka izu gara aga.
Of course, you do not know what hour it is.	N'ezie, ị maghị awa nke a bụ.
It looks like this.	Ọ dị ka nke a.
It was a dark night.	Ọ bụ abalị ojii.
Obviously there is a reason.	Ka o doro anya na e nwere ihe kpatara ya.
I am happy for that.	Enwere m obi ụtọ maka nke ahụ.
He told us what he had done.	Ọ gwara anyị ihe o mere.
The work of this organization is important.	Ọrụ nzukọ a dị mkpa.
But the message is clear.	Ma ozi ahụ doro anya.
Your mother told me about eating and drinking.	Nne gị gwara m gbasara oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
He has a law.	O nwere iwu.
It's impossible.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
John met me at the door.	John zutere m n'ọnụ ụzọ.
I want it to happen.	Achọrọ m ka ọ mee.
I will not let you go.	Agaghị m ekwe ka ị pụọ.
It went on for weeks.	Ọ gara n'ihu ruo ọtụtụ izu.
But no, help.	Mana ọ nweghị, nyere aka.
For some.	Nye ụfọdụ ndị.
These products are in demand.	A na-achọ ngwa ahịa ndị a.
He said immediately.	O kwuru ozugbo.
Just go and do that.	Naanị gaa mee nke ahụ.
The idea is not new.	Echiche ahụ abụghị nke ọhụrụ.
Give it to them.	Nye ha ya.
Why, he did not know.	Maka gịnị, ọ maghị.
She felt like a daughter.	O chere ya dị ka nwa nwanyị.

I have much more to say.	Enwere m ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ ikwu.
What happened to him?	Gịnị mere ya?
Everything or what he thinks.	Ihe niile ma ọ bụ nke ọ na-eche.
We do not know what they are doing.	Anyị amaghị ihe ha na-eme.
Give them a good night's sleep.	Nye ha ezigbo ụra nke ọma.
I know the place.	Amaara m ebe ahụ.
I am not ready for this.	Adịghị m njikere maka nke a.
But they are not happy.	Ma ha adịghị enwe obi ụtọ.
It is true.	Ọ bụ eziokwu.
You have two.	Ị nwere abụọ.
We are the only way to stop.	Anyị bụ naanị ụzọ isi kwụsị.
Be for it.	Bụrụ maka ya.
It's really easy.	Ọ dị mfe n'ezie.
Need help? 	Achọrọ enyemaka?
But it is human life.	Mana ọ bụ ndụ mmadụ.
We interviewed many unemployed residents.	Anyị gbara ọtụtụ ndị bi ebe ahụ na-enweghị ọrụ ajụjụ ọnụ.
Probably the hardest.	Ma eleghị anya nke siri ike.
They are going to find work.	Ha na-aga ịchọta ọrụ.

It was a difficult time.	Ọ bụ oge siri ike.
It never will be.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-abụ.
I did not do much.	Emeghị m ọtụtụ ihe.
Whatever it is, everything will be fine.	Na ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ, ihe niile ga-adị mma.
What an idea.	Kedu echiche.
They are fun.	Ha na-atọ ụtọ .
Most of them work from home.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha na-arụ ọrụ site n'ụlọ.
That is bad, of course.	Nke ahụ dị njọ, n'ezie.
But everything impressed me very much.	Ma ihe niile masịrị m nke ukwuu.
You seem to know a lot about the girl.	Ọ dị ka ị maara ọtụtụ ihe gbasara nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
He hoped such stories would come, but not soon.	Ọ tụrụ anya na akụkọ ndị dị otú ahụ ga-abịa, ma ọ bụghị n'oge na-adịghị anya.
There is a limit that can be fire.	Enwere oke nke nwere ike ibu ọkụ.
This took a lot of time.	Nke a were nnukwu oge.
He has many books.	O nwere ọtụtụ akwụkwọ.
The same is not true with feelings.	Otú ahụ ka mmetụta adịghị otú ahụ.
I have some ideas.	Enwere m echiche ụfọdụ.
The houses here are much larger than those in the countryside.	Ụlọ ndị dị ebe a dị nnọọ ukwuu karịa ndị dị n'ime obodo.
Give us your thoughts.	Nye anyị echiche gị.
There was anger inside.	Iwe dị n'ime ya.
There are other dangers.	Enwere ihe egwu ndị ọzọ.
He is someone whom everyone wants his approval.	Ọ bụ onye onye ọ bụla chọrọ ihu ọma ya.
It is a matter of time.	Ọ bụ okwu oge.

He attends his meetings with his client.	Ọ na-aga nzukọ ya na onye ahịa ya.
But you can see a lot.	Mana ị nwere ike ịhụ nke ukwuu.
I still dread it.	M ka na-atụ ya egwu.
This is very bad.	Nke a dị njọ nke ukwuu.
That was hard for me.	Nke ahụ siri m ike.
It is worse, because it can not help.	Ọ ka njọ, n'ihi na ọ nweghị ike inye aka.
This is basically the only application window.	Nke a bụ isi na naanị windo ngwa.
I do not see how thinking about what happiness might help me.	Anaghị m ahụ otú iche echiche banyere ihe obi ụtọ pụrụ isi nyere m aka.
So do back.	Ya mere, ime azụ.
That surprised us.	Nke ahụ tụrụ anyị n'anya.

Amazing things are happening.	Ihe dị egwu na-eme.

You need more practice.	Ị chọrọ omume karịa.

But only for the time being.	Mana naanị maka oge a.
What is the value of going forward.	Gịnị bụ uru ịga n'ihu.
I do not think many of his friends.	Echeghị m ọtụtụ ndị enyi ya.
Either way.	Nke ọ bụla.
The heat is intense.	Okpomọkụ ahụ siri ike.
It is a short drive to the nearest town.	Ọ bụ obere ụgbọala gaa obodo kacha nso.
Treat yourself like water.	Nwee onwe gị dị ka mmiri.
He had a good day and a bad day.	O nwere ụbọchị ọma na ụbọchị ọjọọ.
We like it, but not us.	Anyị masịrị ya, ma ọ bụghị anyị.
Language is the reason for us.	Asụsụ bụ ihe kpatara anyị.

I've been here once, with a friend.	M nọrọ ebe a otu ugboro, na enyi.
Up to one point.	Ruo otu isi.
He is, he is.	Ọ bụ ya, ọ bụ.
He wanted to make this movie.	Ọ chọrọ ime ihe nkiri a.
I was a little boy at the time.	Adị m obere nwa n'oge ahụ.
He continued in the car.	Ọ gara n'ihu ụgbọ ala ahụ.
Because he says.	N'ihi na ọ na-ekwu.

It is very different from the movie.	Ọ dị nnọọ iche na ihe nkiri ahụ.
I couldn’t do it then.	Enweghị m ike ime ya mgbe ahụ.

Just because they are here.	Naanị n'ihi na ha nọ ebe a.
But this is a problem with a long history.	Ma nke a bụ nsogbu na ogologo akụkọ ihe mere eme.
I have them in different beds.	Enwere m ha na akwa dị iche iche.

For others this is a big problem.	Maka ndị ọzọ nke a bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
But for other reasons, too.	Ma n'ihi ihe ndị ọzọ, kwa.
The reporter asked me a few questions.	Onye nta akụkọ ahụ jụrụ m ajụjụ ole na ole.
We want to continue this practice.	Anyị chọrọ ịga n'ihu na omume a.
If you are looking for one that can be different.	Ọ bụrụ na ị na-achọ nke nwere ike iche.
Everyone is talking about the new restaurant.	Onye ọ bụla na-ekwu maka ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ ọhụrụ ahụ.

The fish is long for this water.	Azụ ahụ dị ogologo maka mmiri a.
Which they will not.	Nke ha agaghị.
But not twice around.	Ma ọ bụghị ugboro abụọ gburugburu.
I do not know what can happen to me.	Amaghị m ihe nwere ike ime m.
Most of the time, they talk to me quickly.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ha na-ekwu okwu ngwa ngwa nye m.
The sportswear is great.	Uwe egwuregwu dị oke mma.
But you are beautiful.	Mana ị mara mma.

You feel beautiful.	Ị na-eche na ọ mara mma.
Let him be with her.	Ka ya na ya nọrọ.

There are no questions about that.	Enweghị ajụjụ gbasara nke ahụ.

No doubt, they understood it well.	O doro anya na ha ghọtara ya nke ọma.
We are not there.	Anyị anọghị ebe ahụ.

My teacher said this was impossible.	Onye nkuzi m kwuru na nke a agaghị ekwe omume.
Her doctor recommended that she eat a vegetarian diet.	Dọkịta ya tụrụ aro ka ọ rie nri anaghị eri anụ.

Well, this is awesome, no games.	Ọ dị mma, nke a dị egwu, enweghị egwuregwu.

The reason for their presence is unknown.	Ihe mere ha ji nọrọ ebe ahụ amaghị.
It is worse than he thought.	Ọ ka njọ karịa ka o chere.

Help is for the needy, whatever they may be.	Enyemaka bụ maka mkpa, ihe ọ bụla ha nwere ike ịbụ.
Everything works fine.	Ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.

We can have dinner.	Anyị pụrụ iri nri abalị.
Drugs are everywhere.	E nwere ọgwụ ọjọọ n'ebe niile.

The food was delicious.	Nri ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
There is no personal opinion.	Enweghị echiche nke onwe.
But he did not know where they were.	Ma ọ maghị ebe ha nọ.
He should not tell her.	O kwesịghị ịgwa ya.
At one point, he loved this house.	N'otu oge, ọ hụrụ ụlọ a n'anya.
The doctors told us his condition was critical.	Ndị dọkịta gwara anyị na ọnọdụ ya dị oke egwu.

It was small in hand, very cold and scary.	Ọ dị obere n'aka ya, ezigbo oyi na egwu.
Therefore.	Ya mere.

Your behavior may think one or the other is stupid, too.	Omume gị nwere ike iche na otu ma ọ bụ nke ọzọ bụ onye nzuzu, kwa.

Thanks for the help.	Daalụ maka enyemaka.
I think they know that.	Echere m na ha maara nke ahụ.

So what are the three main points?	Ya mere, gịnị bụ isi ihe atọ ahụ?
He is here with the rest of us.	Ọ nọ ebe a na anyị ndị ọzọ.
It won’t do you anything else.	Ọ gaghị eme gị ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.

Often, that is what we will do in this life.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị ga-eme na ndụ a.
He started the car.	Ọ malitere ụgbọ ala ahụ.
He died at his side.	Ọ nwụrụ n'akụkụ ya.
Hopefully, from this onwards, it may be a little.	Olileanya, site na nke a gaa n'ihu, ọ nwere ike ịdị ntakịrị.

There are few who say you have a problem with that.	Nwere ole na ole ka ị na-ekwu nsogbu na nke ahụ.
People do not always know what they need.	Ọ bụghị mgbe niile ka ndị mmadụ na-ama ihe dị ha mkpa.

Everything is possible for the moment.	Ihe niile kwere omume maka oge a.
Again, different times.	Ọzọ, oge dị iche iche.
She is the younger sister of my best friend.	Ọ bụ nwanne m nwanyị nke obere nke ezigbo enyi m.

This function requires good physical strength.	Ọrụ a chọrọ ezigbo ike anụ ahụ.
It’s that fast now.	Ọ bụ ngwa ngwa ahụ ugbu a.

Not everyone will do the same for one.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla ga-eme otu ihe ahụ maka otu.
It's a big job.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ọrụ.
That is your job as a parent.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ gị dị ka nne na nna.

Two players play this game.	Ndị egwuregwu abụọ na-egwu egwuregwu a.

Others were terrified.	Ndị ọzọ tụrụ egwu nke ukwuu.
The idea is clear.	Echiche a doro anya.
This is not a complete story.	Nke a abụghị akụkọ zuru oke.
They should not know.	Ha ekwesịghị ịma.
This is what you are looking for.	Nke a bụ ihe ị na-achọ.

It's not your fault, of course.	Ọ bụghị gị kpatara, n'ezie.
He did not want to talk.	Ọ chọghị ikwu okwu.
However, each working group makes its own story.	Otú ọ dị, ọrụ ọ bụla na-arụ ọrụ na-eme akụkọ nke ya.
You know nothing.	Ị maghị ihe ọ bụla.
Everything goes in his mouth.	Ihe niile na-aga n'ọnụ ya.

The addict wants it from time to time.	Onye riri ahụ chọrọ ya site n'oge ruo n'oge.

Two passengers were killed.	Ndị njem abụọ nwụrụ.

The word "is" does not work.	Okwu ahụ bụ "bụ" anaghị arụ ọrụ.

But we should not be too quick to separate.	Ma anyị ekwesịghị ịdị ngwa ngwa iche.

Success came quickly.	Ihe ịga nke ọma bịara ngwa ngwa.

It was the first thing he said since everyone had arrived.	Ọ bụ ihe mbụ o kwuru kemgbe mmadụ niile rutere.
Something inside another room.	Ihe dị n'ime ụlọ ọzọ.
That was not his feeling at all.	Nke ahụ abụghị mmetụta ya ma ọlị.

Some people are hungry.	Agụụ na-agụ ụfọdụ ndị.

No one did.	Ọ dịghị onye mere.
I asked him if he loved her very much.	M jụrụ ya ma ọ̀ hụrụ ya n’anya nke ukwuu.
This feeling is worse than any other negative.	Mmetụta a dị njọ karịa ihe ọjọọ ọ bụla ọzọ.
I had no idea they were there.	Amaghị m na ha nọ ebe ahụ.
But the day is far away.	Ma ụbọchị ahụ dị ezigbo anya.

He speaks four languages.	Ọ na-asụ asụsụ anọ.
As for me, I was shocked.	Ma mụ onwe m, ọ gbara m ọnụ.
They are clearly as a couple.	Ha doro anya dị ka di na nwunye.

However, his mother had other plans.	Otú ọ dị, nne ya nwere atụmatụ ndị ọzọ.
Tell me why you are here.	Gwa m ihe mere i ji nọrọ ebe a.
There is no perfect or safe way.	Ọ dịghị ụzọ zuru oke ma ọ bụ dị mma.
Men are afraid when they love a woman so much.	Ụjọ na-ama ụmụ nwoke ma ha hụ nwanyị n'anya nke ukwuu.

They have such authority.	Ha nwere ikike dị otú ahụ.
Things do not exist.	Ihe adịghị adị.
I will look for a job tomorrow, he said.	Aga m achọ ọrụ echi, o kwuru.
The water on the shore was clear.	Mmiri dị n'akụkụ mmiri ahụ doro anya.
Not that it’s important for your brand.	Ọ bụghị na ọ dị mkpa maka ụdị gị.
In court, these are just words.	N'ụlọ ikpe, ndị a bụ naanị okwu.

He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
The little boy was terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ obere nwa ahụ.
I will not have any problems with it.	Agaghị m enwe nsogbu ọ bụla na ya.
Prison sentences can be seen as cruel and cruel.	Enwere ike ịhụ ikpe mkpọrọ dị ka obi ọjọọ na obi ọjọọ.
Other days life seems a little different.	Ụbọchị ndị ọzọ ndụ yiri ntakịrị.

We think or story.	Anyị na-eche ma ọ bụ akụkọ.

For something very different, of course.	N'ihi ihe dị nnọọ iche, n'ezie.
The meeting was held for over two days.	E mere nzukọ ahụ ihe karịrị ụbọchị abụọ.
Why should it.	Gịnị mere ọ ga-eji.
The boat left port yesterday.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ hapụrụ ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ụnyahụ.
If someone is in trouble, help them.	Ọ bụrụ na mmadụ nọ ná nsogbu, nyere ha aka.
That’s what we want to get out of.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị chọrọ ịpụ.
It's not a story, it's scary.	Ọ bụghị akụkọ mere ya, ọ bụ egwu.
But you will be fine.	Mana ị ga-adị mma.
This is the state of the current situation.	Nke a bụ ala nke ọnọdụ dị ugbu a.
He came to dinner.	Ọ bịara iri nri abalị.
This is a human being.	Nke a bụ mmadụ.
I do not want to see anything.	Achọghị m ịhụ ihe ọ bụla.
Because it will be different every time you see it.	N'ihi na ọ ga-adị iche mgbe ọ bụla ị hụrụ ya.
All is well.	Ihe niile dị mma.
This is really fun but there is no challenge for it.	Nke a bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ n'ezie mana ọ nweghị ihe ịma aka ya.
The back is about the same.	Azụ bụ ihe dị ka otu ihe ahụ.
Very little food was eaten at that time.	A na-eri nri dị nnọọ nta n'oge ahụ.
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
Maybe that’s what happened here.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ bụ ihe mere ebe a.
They invited me to come to a bar.	Ha kpọrọ m ka m bịa ebe a na-eri mmanya.
We love women and they can see that.	Anyị hụrụ ụmụ nwanyị n'anya ma ha nwere ike ịhụ nke ahụ.
He named each girl after him.	Ọ kpọrọ nwa agbọghọ ọ bụla aha ya.
It would be nice and good for this to happen.	Ọ ga-adị mma ma dị mma maka nke a ime.
I am happy with it.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ya.

You can not say anything.	Ị nweghị ike ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
Everyone wants to play those songs.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ ịkpọ egwu ndị ahụ.
The woman entered the room.	Nwanyị ahụ banyere n'ime ime ụlọ.
That would have been his birth.	Nke ahụ gaara abụ mgbe a mụrụ ya.
You have to do this every day.	Ị ga-eme nke a kwa ụbọchị.
Just tell us when you would like to travel.	Naanị gwa anyị mgbe ị ga-achọ ime njem.
I'll tell you that.	Aga m agwa gị nke ahụ.
It is recommended that you do not eat it.	A na-atụ aro ka ị ghara iri ya.
So be happy.	Ya mere nwee obi ụtọ.
I do not see anything else you can say.	Ahụghị m ihe ọzọ ị nwere ike ikwu.
The girl is beautiful.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ mara mma.
I think we will do this together.	Echere m na anyị ga-eme nke a ọnụ.
The book frightened me.	Akwụkwọ ahụ tụrụ m ụjọ.
You have to be strong in what you do.	Ị ga-adị ike n'ihe ị.
It is a different matter.	Ọ bụ ihe dị iche.
Now go to your room.	Ugbu a gaa n'ọnụ ụlọ gị.
Grandmother loved her new food.	Nne nne masịrị eri ọhụrụ ya.
He always enjoyed playing.	Ọ na-enwe mmasị mgbe niile igwu egwu.
You have something inside you that consumes you.	Ị nwere ihe n'ime gị nke na-eri gị.
That is the worst.	Nke ahụ bụ nke kacha njọ.
There is something special.	Enwere ihe pụrụ iche.
I just do not know.	Amaghị m nnọọ.
But he says it over and over again.	Ma ọ na-ekwu ya ugboro ugboro.
It is a good city.	Ọ bụ ezigbo obodo.
He gave her the ability to see.	O nyere ya ikike ịhụ ụzọ.
She is so cute in her dinner dress.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu na uwe oriri na ọṅụṅụ ya.
How did he do it?	Olee otú o si mee ya?
Everywhere you know it.	Ebe ọ bụla ma na ya.
He wants to know what you did.	Ọ chọrọ ịma ka ị mere.
It is really useful.	Ọ bara uru n'ezie.
It is so bad.	Ọ dị njọ otú ahụ.
Of course we would not.	N'ezie anyị agaraghị abụ.
It now has two main points.	O nwere isi ihe abụọ ugbu a.
Nice to see.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ.
You do not want me.	Ị chọghị m.
No power!	Ọ dịghị ike!
It started well, got worse, and ended well.	Ọ malitere nke ọma, ka njọ, wee kwụsị nke ọma.
Long way out.	Ogologo ụzọ pụọ.
That’s very important, you know.	Nke ahụ dị oke mkpa, ị maara.
It is important to act.	Ọ dị mkpa ime ihe.
You are right.	I kwuru eziokwu.
What you like and what you don’t like.	Ihe na-amasị gị na ihe na-amasị gị.
So the same thing with water.	Ya mere, otu ihe ahụ na mmiri.
But that is not good.	Ma nke ahụ adịghị mma.
I left both of them there.	M hapụrụ ha abụọ n'ebe ahụ.
For me it was the school of life.	Maka m ọ bụ ụlọ akwụkwọ nke ndụ.
It's too long.	Ọ dị oke ogologo.
I think someone else said it best.	Echere m na onye ọzọ kwuru ya kacha mma.
He was not present yesterday.	Ọ anọghị ụnyahụ.
It’s a benefit started from scratch.	Ọ bụ uru malitere n'isi.
Most people will.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ga-enwe.
It can be done.	Enwere ike ime ya.
However, it is not necessary at this time.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mkpa n'oge a.
Not his gift.	Ọ bụghị onyinye ya.
But nothing like what is happening now.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe dị ka ihe na-eme ugbu a.
There is interest.	Enwere mmasị.
He died for them.	Ọ nwụrụ ha.
However, that happens only if the righteous do the work.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ na-eme naanị ma ọ bụrụ na ndị ezi omume na-arụ ọrụ ahụ.
You know what will happen.	Ị maara ihe ga-eme.
It will not be good.	Ọ gaghị adị mma.
But there are no strict and fast rules here.	Mana enweghị iwu siri ike na ngwa ngwa ebe a.
But there is something.	Mana enwere ihe.
Not a good thing.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo ihe.
I want to help with your book.	Achọrọ m inye aka na akwụkwọ gị.
I think so.	Echere m ya.
New in town, just trying to make friends.	Ọhụrụ n'ime obodo, naanị na-agbalị ime enyi.
I did not find anything special.	Ahụghị m ihe ọ bụla pụrụ iche.
It happens, you know.	Ọ na-eme, ị maara.
You can see it.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ya.
They do not care.	Ha achọghị ịma.
The house was surrounded by trees.	Osisi gbara ụlọ ahụ gburugburu.
Nice service if you can get it.	Ọrụ mara mma ma ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike nweta ya.
I always think about this really.	M mgbe niile na-eche banyere nke a n'ezie.
I don’t want to know what makes them stop.	Achọghị m ịma ihe na-eme ka ha kwụsị.
This is difficult for most people.	Nke a siri ike nye ọtụtụ mmadụ.
I saw lights all around me.	Ahụrụ m ọkụ gburugburu m.
I think the only thing we should talk about is ourselves.	Echere m na naanị ihe anyị kwesịrị ikwu banyere onwe anyị.
Therefore, we only need to do the higher.	Ya mere, naanị anyị kwesịrị ime nke elu.
Truth is false.	Eziokwu bụ ụgha.
She had a dream.	E nwere ihe ọ tụrụ anya ịhụ ime.
These are very different.	Ndị a dị nnọọ iche.
As his mind lives on.	Otú ahụ uche ya si dị ndụ.
I only do housework.	Naanị ọrụ ụlọ ka m na-eme.
She seemed surprised.	Ọ dị ya ka o juru ya anya.
There was a little hard on his side.	Ọ dị ntakịrị ihe siri ike n'akụkụ ya.
The word itself is secondary.	Okwu n'onwe ya bụ nke abụọ.
It was a good time.	Ọ bụ ezigbo oge.
Simply put.	Ọ dị obere ikwu ya n'ụzọ dị mfe.
Therefore.	Ya mere.
We will not do such a thing.	Anyị agaghị eme ụdị ihe ahụ.
In the meantime, just sit back and relax.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, naanị nọdụ ala ma zuru ike.
You know, right away, everyone else.	Ị mara, ozugbo, onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
But this is not a school.	Mana nke a abụghị ụlọ akwụkwọ.
The houses on the beach are all new.	Ụlọ ndị dị n'akụkụ osimiri niile dị ọhụrụ.

We will do all we can to help you.	Anyị ga-eme ike anyị niile inyere gị aka.

The boy is mine.	Nwa nwoke ahụ bụ nke m.
They knew that our nephew was coming.	Ha ma na nwa nwanne anyị na-abịa.
Then comes the price.	Mgbe ahụ bịa ọnụ ahịa.
We do our job for a reward.	Anyị na-arụ ọrụ anyị maka ụgwọ ọrụ.
She wore a second color dress.	O tinyere uwe agba nke abụọ.
I had this problem once.	Enwere m nsogbu a otu ugboro.
I'm sorry, he said.	Ọ dị m nwute, o kwuru.
He is a good friend.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi.
Consumption is low.	Oriri ike dị ala.
I am now in the same predicament as my father.	Anọ m ugbu a n'otu nsogbu nke nna m.
And he did so.	O wee mee nke ahụ.

It is, of course, the same for me.	Ọ bụ, n'ezie, otu ahụ nye m.
He drove his car at high speed.	Ọ gbara ụgbọ ala ya na nnukwu ọsọ.
I found it delicious.	Ahụrụ m na ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
He is not a fool.	Ọ bụghị onye nzuzu.
She looked surprised and happy to see me.	Ọ dị ya ka ọ tụrụ m n'anya ma nwee obi ụtọ ịhụ m.
I will easily be their best customer.	M ga-adị mfe ịbụ ndị ahịa ha kacha mma.
He is a doer.	Ọ bụ onye na-eme ihe.
Maybe it was then.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ mgbe ahụ.
However, there are others.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ndị ọzọ.
His power is awesome.	Ike ya dị nnọọ egwu.
Not a newspaper.	Ọ bụghị akwụkwọ akụkọ.
Trees don't need any more help.	Osisi anaghị achọ enyemaka ọzọ.
Unfortunately, there are few opportunities here.	O di nwute, enwere ohere ole na ole ebe a.
That's not me.	Nke ahụ abụghị m.
Here they are not.	Ebe a ha adịghị.
This actually happens a lot.	Nke a na-eme n'ezie ọtụtụ ihe.
He does not like driving.	Ịnya ụgbọ ala anaghị amasị ya.
In trouble.	Na nsogbu.
He made money last year.	O nwetara ego n'afọ gara aga.
We are very close to him.	Anyị nọ ya nso nke ukwuu.
If so.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị.
It is good today.	Ọ dị mma taa.
I run fast.	M na-agba ọsọ ọsọ.
He has had a few things in the past.	O nwere ihe ole na ole n'oge gara aga.
The team gave the staff another look and attention when needed.	Ndị otu ahụ nyere ndị ọrụ ahụ anya na ntị ọzọ mgbe achọrọ ya.
On the boat.	Na ụgbọ mmiri.
He is very much afraid.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya nke ukwuu.
Until then.	Ruo mgbe ọ dị.
That is not for me to say.	Nke ahụ abụghị maka m ikwu.
All I needed was a book.	Ihe dị m mkpa bụ inwe akwụkwọ.
You know that this thing will never die.	Ị mara na ihe a agaghị anwụ ma ọlị.
All they want is the baby.	Naanị ihe ha chọrọ bụ nwata ahụ.

Good is different than sweet.	Ezi dị iche karịa ụtọ.
Never go away from that.	Ọ dịghị mgbe pụọ na nke ahụ.
I am one of them.	Abụ m otu n'ime ha.
I really said.	M kwuru n'ezie.
He eventually left.	O mechara pụọ.
The problems are there, but far away.	Nsogbu ndị ahụ dị, ma n'ebe dị anya.
Some fear, of all things, but still exist.	Ụfọdụ na-atụ egwu, nke ihe niile, ma ka dị ugbu a.
When he looked, he saw nothing.	Mgbe o lere anya, o nweghị ebe ọ hụrụ ya.
Here I am.	A bụ m n'ezie.
This boat is everywhere.	Ụgbọ mmiri a dị ebe niile.

They can be alone.	Ha nwere ike ịnọ naanị.
He was not the one who put me there.	Ọ bụghị ya bụ onye tinyere m ebe ahụ.
Just her weakness, the shoes.	Naanị adịghị ike ya, akpụkpọ ụkwụ.
None of us are athletes with such people.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị bụ ndị egwuregwu na ndị dị otú ahụ.
Now we have to hope for the best.	Ugbu a, anyị kwesịrị inwe olileanya maka ihe kacha mma.
I think the two of you are very close.	Echere m na unu abụọ dị ezigbo nso.
But nothing.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla.
Lots, lots of things.	Ọtụtụ, ọtụtụ ihe.
Just one of many.	Naanị otu n'ime ọtụtụ.
He should be happy.	O kwesịrị inwe obi ụtọ.
Certainly not for me.	O doro anya na ọ bụghị maka m.
But he spoke.	Mana o kwuru okwu.
But that is very good.	Ma, nke ahụ dị mma nke ukwuu.
We love them.	Anyị hụrụ ha n'anya.
Still, I think this is a really useful thing.	N'agbanyeghị nke a, echere m na nke a bụ ihe bara uru n'ezie.
He seems to know it well.	Ọ dị ka ọ maara nke ọma.
We do not want it anymore.	Anyị achọghị ya ọzọ.
I feel so much better now.	Adị m mma nke ukwuu ugbu a.
What he said on this point makes sense.	Ihe o kwuru banyere nke a nwere ezi uche.

That's not bad.	Nke ahụ adịghị njọ.
You have what you need.	Ị nwere ihe ị chọrọ.
Which, of course, happened.	Nke, n'ezie, mere.
It's really beautiful.	Ọ mara mma n'ezie.
We have to get out, get away from here, from here.	Anyị kwesịrị ịpụ, pụọ n'ebe dị anya, site n'ebe a.
Best fight.	Ọgụ kacha mma.
For a long time.	Ogologo oge.
I knew it would be a challenging lesson.	Ama m na ọ ga-abụ nkuzi nwere ihe ịma aka.
Convicted and imprisoned.	Ikpe ya na mkpọrọ.
The customer made me buy it.	Onye ahịa ahụ mere ka m zụta ya.
The villagers need leaves but they have no trees.	Ndị obodo ahụ chọrọ akwụkwọ ma ha enweghị osisi.
Stories go like this.	Akụkọ na-aga dị ka ndị a.
Feel free, see what you do.	Nwee mmetụta, hụ ihe ị na-eme.
The meeting unanimously.	Nzukọ ahụ n'otu ọnụ.
People here are here.	Ndị nọ ebe a nọ ebe a.
Today, we left three.	Taa, anyị hapụrụ atọ.
I am ready, he said.	Adị m njikere, o kwuru.
This was his last work.	Nke a bụ ọrụ ikpeazụ o mere.
He may have known that he was in the second thought.	O nwere ike ịbụ na ọ maara na ọ nọ na uche nke abụọ.
He is righteous.	Ọ bụ onye ezi omume.
Dogs are family members.	Nkịta bụ onye ezinụlọ.
His interest is unparalleled.	Mmasị ya enweghị atụ.
But it is everywhere.	Mana ọ bụ ebe niile.
It was special that night.	Ọ pụrụ iche n'abalị ahụ.
I want it to look beautiful but it is simple.	Achọrọ m ka ọ mara mma mana ọ dị mfe.
I hope you can do it.	Enwere m olileanya na ị nwere ike ime ya.
Why is this happening?	Gịnị kpatara nke a ji eme.
Another shout came from the backyard.	Mkpu ọzọ na mkpu si n'azụ ụlọ bịa.
They do not paint well.	Ha anaghị agba nke ọma.
I think he was the man everyone looked at.	Echere m na ọ bụ nwoke ahụ onye ọ bụla lere anya.
They are not good.	Ha adịghị mma.
But the reason is good.	Mana ihe kpatara ya dị mma.
Still, it is a good life.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ bụ ezigbo ndụ.
The same is true of the third.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị nke atọ.
So he can go.	Ya mere o nwere ike ịga.
We should not say more than that.	Anyị ekwesịghị ikwu karịa nke ahụ.
Not the life you expected.	Ọ bụghị ndụ ị tụrụ anya ya.
It may be his favorite, anytime.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe kacha amasị ya, mgbe ọ bụla.
It was obtained.	E nwetara ya.
He wanted to make another trip.	Ọ chọrọ ka o mee njem ọzọ.
I saw the head first.	Ahụrụ m isi ahụ nke mbụ.
Of course, they have different opinions about it.	N'ezie, ha nwere echiche dị iche iche banyere ya.
He left his entire way of life.	Ọ hapụrụ ụzọ ndụ ya niile.
Language is the key word here.	Asụsụ bụ isi okwu ebe a.
It’s tough, it’s good anyway.	Ọ siri ike, ọ dị mma n'agbanyeghị.
I was there only three hours or more.	Anọ m ebe ahụ naanị awa atọ ma ọ bụ karịa.
In the distance, a good friend from school.	N'ebe dị anya, ezigbo enyi si ụlọ akwụkwọ.
People are not pointing at you again.	Ndị mmadụ anaghị atụ gị aka ọzọ.
But we.	Ma anyị .
Of course, everyone is different.	N'ezie, onye ọ bụla dị iche.
They are on the other side of the page.	Ha nọ n'akụkụ ọzọ nke ibe ahụ.
Just my other son.	Naanị nwa m nwoke ọzọ.
Either way, you know me.	Kedu ụzọ ọ bụla, ị maara m.
He and I.	Ya na m.
Not too serious, of course.	Ọ bụghị oke njọ, n'ezie.
His question is good and important.	Ajụjụ ya dị mma ma dị mkpa.
I started to cry.	M malitere ibe ákwá.
We have a good time.	Anyị nwere ezigbo oge ime ya.
He was just a man.	Ọ bụ naanị nwoke.
Not calling his mother or me.	Ọ bụghị ịkpọ nne ya ma ọ bụ m.
The head is so beautiful!	Onye isi ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu!
They say that the boy would have been a boy.	Ha na-ekwu na nwa ahụ gaara abụ nwoke.
You do not deserve it.	I kwesịghị ya.
They all spent the day.	Ha niile nọrọ ụbọchị ahụ.
The work was pointless.	Arụ ọrụ ahụ enweghị isi.
I am going for the bookstore.	M na-aga maka ime akwụkwọ ahụ.
The project was successful.	Ọrụ ahụ gara nke ọma.
There may be some challenges in the book.	Enwere ike inwe ụfọdụ ihe ịma aka na akwụkwọ.
Because nothing is better than this.	N'ihi na ihe ọ bụla dị mma karịa nke a.
Among the workers.	N'ime ndị na-arụ ọrụ.
That saved me a lot of trouble.	Nke ahụ mere ka m ghara inwe ọtụtụ nsogbu.
His house is small, but it is nice.	Ụlọ ya dị obere, ma ọ dị mma.
I have a picture of him here.	Enwere m foto ya ebe a.
Maybe it's just a test.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ naanị ule.
Good day.	Ezigbo ụbọchị.
His plan worked well.	Atụmatụ ya gara nke ọma.
I looked at it through the window.	M lere ya anya site na windo.
Costs are high.	Ọnụ ego dị elu.
How it happened.	Ka o si mee.
I hope they become his friends.	Enwere m olileanya na ha ga-abụ enyi ya.
But, in time, he did.	Ma o doro anya na ka oge na-aga, o nwere.
These ideas are beyond their comprehension.	Echiche ndị a karịrị ha.
But anyone can do it cheaply.	Mana onye ọ bụla nwere ike ime ọnụ ala.
You can do this from anywhere.	Ị nwere ike ime nke a site n'ebe ọ bụla.
This made us happy.	Nke a mere ka obi dị anyị mma.
Can anyone help me?	Ọ dị onye nwere ike inyere m aka?
Many are higher than they are.	Ọtụtụ ndị dị elu karịa ha.
The journey was long and arduous.	Njem ahụ dị ogologo na nke siri ike.
Let him be with her.	Ka ya na ya nọrọ.
The trip took several hours.	Njem ahụ were ọtụtụ awa.
It will definitely happen no matter what.	Ọ ga-eme n'ezie n'agbanyeghị ihe ọ bụla.
Maybe I won’t do it.	Ma eleghị anya, agaghị m eme ya.
It's useless.	O nweghị isi.
He put his hand on her knife.	O tinyere aka ya na mma ya.
It is pointless.	Ọ bụ ihe na-enweghị isi.
But there are different ways of doing this.	Ma e nwere ụzọ dị iche iche e si eme nke a.
The only living things on earth that do this are the dead.	Naanị ihe ndị ọzọ dị ndụ na-eme nke a bụ ndị nwụrụ anwụ.
They did not know about it, my parents.	Ha na ndị mụrụ m amaghị banyere ya.
Not this !.	Ọ bụghị nke a!.
I think this could be a problem.	Echere m na nke a nwere ike ịbụ nsogbu.
The old store.	Ụlọ ahịa ahụ ochie.
Now the problem.	Ugbu a nsogbu.
Many say it is the best.	Ọtụtụ ndị na-ekwu na ọ kacha mma.
I said that.	M kwuru nke ahụ.
I think your idea is just yours.	Echere m na echiche gị bụ naanị nke gị.
It’s not expensive, just a different head.	Ọ bụghị ọnụ, naanị isi dị iche.
They are all mothers.	Ha bụ nne ha niile.
What about it ?.	Kedu maka ya?.
That would be true.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ eziokwu.
It's scary, you know.	Ọ gbara egwu, ị mara.
Up to the back door.	Ruo n'ọnụ ụzọ ụlọ azụ.
Wait, you said.	Chere, ị kwuru.
But he can see nothing more.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ pụrụ ịhụ.
I don’t want that to be me.	Achọghị m ka nke ahụ bụrụ m.
It should have one.	O kwesịrị inwe otu.
Give me pleasure, he said.	Nye m ihe ụtọ, o kwuru.
Your help came as soon as we needed it.	Enyemaka gị bịara ozugbo anyị chọrọ ya.
His words are hard and cold.	Okwu ya siri ike na oyi.
He never followed her.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bụla iso ya.
The money was used to buy something.	E ji ego ahụ zụta ihe.
So in this case.	Ya mere na nke ugbu a.
Maybe it's not too bad to get around.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dịghị njọ nke ukwuu inwe gburugburu.
The reasons for this are different.	Ihe kpatara nke a dị iche iche.
Let's get to the heart of the matter.	Ka anyị ruo n'isi okwu.
Everything is our job.	Ihe niile bụ ọrụ anyị.
Always wear old clothes.	Yiri uwe ochie mgbe niile.
The car is really fun.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ na-atọ ụtọ n'ezie.
That was one of my tasks.	Nke ahụ bụ otu n'ime ọrụ m.
Like two years ago.	Dị ka afọ abụọ gara aga.
He did it for his own son.	O mere ya maka nwa nke ya.
Everyone wants to help.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ inyere ya aka.
He has a famous face.	O nwere ihu ama ama.
I do not know how to do it.	Amaghị m otu esi eme ya.
The ground is solid in this building.	Ala ahụ siri ike n'ime ụlọ a.
He has no power,	O nweghị ikike,
He liked it at first.	Ọ masịrị ya na mbụ.
Of course it will.	N'ezie ọ ga-eme.
They are not the same fight.	Ha abụghị otu ọgụ.
Many of their relatives are doctors.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị ikwu ha bụ ndị dọkịta.
I need you more.	Achọrọ m gị karịa.
But he did not know why he had done these things.	Ma ọ maghị ihe mere o ji mee ihe ndị a dị iche iche.
A plan is your plan.	Atụmatụ bụ atụmatụ gị.
We never took drugs.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị na-aṅụ ọgwụ ike.
He is the only other person here who has been around for years.	Ọ bụ naanị ya bụ onye ọzọ nọ ebe a afọ ndụ ya.
It's small.	Ọ dị ntakịrị.
No one seems to have seen !.	Ọ dịghị onye yiri ka ọ hụrụ!.
There is never a problem.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bụla na nsogbu.
It is a restaurant city.	Ọ bụ obodo oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
Their team will not be ready for this game.	Otu ha agaghị adị njikere maka egwuregwu a.
He took responsibility for his actions.	O were ọrụ maka omume ya.
Sometimes your story is really famous.	Mgbe ụfọdụ akụkọ gị na-ama ama n'ezie.
A few years.	Afọ ole na ole.
That burned me.	Nke ahụ gbara m ọkụ.
But it is a real abomination.	Ma ọ bụ ezigbo ihe arụ.
I love you, you love me.	Ahụrụ m gị n'anya, ị hụrụ m n'anya.
If you love me, you will want to do that too.	Ọ bụrụ na ị hụrụ m n'anya, ị ga-achọ ime nke ahụ.
The woman held the boy's hand.	Nwanyị ahụ were aka nwa nwoke ahụ n’aka abụọ.
He went.	Ọ gara.
However, this speed is good.	Otú ọ dị, ọsọ a dị mma.
After all, we hated each other.	Mgbe o mechara, anyị kpọrọ ibe anyị asị.
Sorry, there are two questions.	Mgbaghara, enwere ajụjụ abụọ.
These things may vary.	Ihe ndị a nwere ike ịdị iche iche.
Okay but here we are.	Ọ dị mma mana ebe a ka anyị nọ.
Everyone is happy.	Onye ọ bụla nwere obi ụtọ.
Now they have it.	Ugbu a, ha nwere ya.
Her body is still feminine.	Ahụ ya ka bụ nwanyị.
But one thing stopped him.	Ma, otu ihe kwụsịrị ya.
I do it one, it makes me one.	M na-eme ya otu, ọ na-eme m otu.
You expect it more.	Ị na-atụ anya ya karịa.
Rural apartments are expensive.	Ụlọ ndị dị n'ime ime obodo dị oke ọnụ.
Just existence.	Naanị ịdị adị.
He is very surprised.	O juru ya anya nke ukwuu.
He would not mind going to a party if he was with her.	Ọ gaghị achọ ịma ịga oriri na ọṅụṅụ ma ọ bụrụ na ya na ya nọ.
I like that kind of thing.	Ụdị ihe ahụ na-atọ m ụtọ.
Your son will be their brother.	Nwa gị nwoke ga-abụ nwanne di ha.
Let's do it right away.	Ka anyị mee ya ozugbo.
He is someone else.	Ọ bụ onye ọzọ.
He looks like a dead man.	Ọ dị ka onye nwụrụ anwụ.
Her brother is the only one she calls her friend.	Nwanne ya nwoke bụ naanị onye ọ kpọrọ enyi ya.
Not such a big deal.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu ihe dị otú ahụ.
It will be a long night.	Ọ ga-abụ ogologo abalị.
Get out of the way.	Si n'ụzọ pụọ.
They do the job well.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ ahụ nke ọma.
That is the other way around.	Nke ahụ bụ nke ọzọ.
This is a small town.	Nke a bụ obere obodo.
So we met when we were little.	Ya mere, anyị zutere mgbe anyị ka dị obere.
This year’s market continues.	Ahịa nke afọ a na-aga n'ihu.
I will be the judge of that.	M ga-abụ onye ikpe nke ahụ.
It is the books.	Ọ bụ akwụkwọ ndị ahụ.
I do not know about you.	Amaghị m maka gị.
Immediately he shed tears in his eyes.	Ozugbo ọ hụrụ anya mmiri n'anya ya.
He did what he did.	O mere ihe o mere.
This scared me.	Ihe a tụrụ m ụjọ.
But he did not know.	Ma ọ maghị.
Great for groups and families.	Akwa maka otu na ezinụlọ.
You are free.	Ị nwere onwe gị.
The tree does not see.	Osisi anaghị ahụ.
That's a minute.	Nke ahụ bụ otu nkeji.
The man knew very well that they were ready.	Nwoke ahụ maara nke ọma na ha dị njikere.
He was angry.	Iwe were ya.
It was a good feast.	Ọ bụ ezigbo oriri.
I like being in his office.	Ọ masịrị m ịnọ na ụlọ ọrụ ya.
He would have had a lot of alcohol.	Ọ gaara enwe oke mmanya.
I like it there all the time.	Enwere m mmasị n'ebe ahụ oge ọ bụla.
I would like to go swimming.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịga igwu mmiri.
Lots of weight this year.	Ọtụtụ ibu n'afọ a.

Take them seriously.	Were ha n'obi.
You eat a lot of fast food.	Ị na-eri oke nri ngwa ngwa.
For people, for me.	Maka ndị mmadụ, maka m.
It's bad.	Ọ dị njọ.
Here they come.	Ebe a ka ha na-abịa.
And inside, you know that.	Na n'ime, ị maara nke ahụ.
I was with him here and there.	Anọ m na ya ebe a na ebe ahụ.
His life was cold.	Ndụ ya jụrụ oyi.
That was the first ten.	Nke ahụ dị na mbụ na iri.
It is a good weapon.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ngwa ọgụ.
Everyone runs on it.	Onye ọ bụla na-agba ọsọ na ya.
If so, what can you do about it?	Ọ bụrụ na ị bụ ya, gịnị ka ị ga-eme?
Not a question.	Ọ bụghị ajụjụ.
I do not know my value as a person.	Amaghị m uru m bara dị ka mmadụ.

Meetings are held every night.	A na-enwe nzukọ kwa abalị.
He did not know where they were going.	Ọ maghị ebe ha na-aga.
Nor should anyone.	Ma ọ bụ onye ọ bụla ekwesịghị.
But it is really more than that.	Ma ọ bụ n'ezie karịa nke ahụ.
Everyone knows it.	Onye ọ bụla maara ya.
You two are my friends.	Unu abụọ bụ ndị enyi m.
This is my accident.	Nke a bụ ihe mberede m kpatara.

You want to help them, feed them, move on.	Ị chọrọ inyere ha aka, nye ha nri, gaa n'ihu.

On the contrary, of course.	N'ụzọ dị iche, n'ezie.
Most of these are students.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị a bụ ụmụ akwụkwọ.

Many people came to see the event.	Ọtụtụ mmadụ bịara ịhụ ihe omume ahụ.
That made it less than ten.	Nke ahụ mere ka ọ dị obere ka iri.
And they were right.	O wee bụrụ na ha kwuru eziokwu.
I will see him again and again and know him well.	Aga m ahụ ya ugboro ugboro ma mara ya nke ọma.

It is good to be close to him.	Ọ dị mma ịnọ ya nso.
He asked her why.	Ọ jụrụ ya ihe kpatara ya.
Boy, did he let me get it.	Nwa nwoke, o kwere ka m nweta ya.
But this is one of them.	Ma nke a bụ otu n'ime ha.
This can be done together or not.	Enwere ike ime nke a n'otu ọnụ ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị.

It is not wanted here.	Achọghị ya ebe a.

He invited me to his home for dinner.	Ọ kpọrọ m ka m bịa n’ụlọ ya rie nri abalị.
Gradually, in some ways.	Nke nta nke nta, n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
Take it away.	Were ya pụọ.
That caused the fever.	Nke ahụ kpatara ahụ ọkụ ahụ.
That is what he expects to happen.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ tụrụ anya na ọ ga-eme.
Not the other way around.	Ọ bụghị n'ụzọ ọzọ gburugburu.
So much for that and good.	Nke ukwuu maka na ezigbo.
Some of them are my best friends.	Ụfọdụ n’ime ha bụ ezigbo enyi m.

He thought it would be as he had said.	O chere na ọ ga-abụ dị ka o kwuru.
You will be the mother of her children.	Ị ga-abụ nne ụmụ ya.
Otherwise, you will have difficulties.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ị ga-enwe ihe isi ike.

His smile was so beautiful.	Ọchị ọchị ya mara mma nke ukwuu.
The first is the responsibility to speak the truth.	Nke mbụ n’ime ha bụ ibu ọrụ nke ikwu eziokwu.
Or, sometimes, worse.	Ma ọ bụ, mgbe ụfọdụ, njọ.
He loved the river.	Ọ hụrụ osimiri n'anya.

Every race needs to have a purpose.	Ọsọ ọ bụla kwesịrị inwe isi na ya.

He was happy when everyone was done.	Obi dị ya ụtọ mgbe mmadụ niile mechara.
That was his mother calling this morning.	Nke ahụ bụ nne ya kpọrọ n'ụtụtụ a.
It doesn't work for long.	Ọ naghị arụ ọrụ ogologo oge.

Do it with unfamiliar music.	Mee ya na egwu nke amaghị.
Others say it's just always there.	Ndị ọzọ na-ekwu na ọ bụ naanị ebe ahụ mgbe niile.

If you come here, you will not see it.	Ọ bụrụ na ị bịa ebe a, ị gaghị ahụ ya.
You know who we are, now.	Ị maara ndị anyị bụ, ugbu a.

But every time he saw it, for that matter.	Ma ọ bụ oge ọ bụla ọ hụrụ ya, maka nke ahụ.
I am here.	Anọ m ebe a.
The story is here.	Akụkọ dị ebe a.
A person's bad behavior towards a person seems to be absolute.	Omume ọjọọ nke mmadụ n'ebe mmadụ nọ dị ka ihe zuru oke.
The reporter said the story was false.	Onye nta akụkọ ahụ kwuru na akụkọ a bụ ụgha.

I really enjoy being alone.	Ọ dị m nnọọ mma ịnọ naanị m.

They do that and are beautiful.	Ha na-eme ihe ahụ ma mara mma.
They are two different stories.	Ha bụ akụkọ abụọ dị iche iche.
I will continue with those questions further, more often.	Aga m aga n'ihu na ajụjụ ndị ahụ n'ihu, ọtụtụ oge.

It is true with applications.	Ọ bụ eziokwu na ngwa.
The reason is important.	Ọ dị mkpa ihe kpatara ya.

How long did we last meet?	Ogologo oge ole ka anyị zutere ikpeazụ?
He apparently feared for his life.	O doro anya na ụjọ tụrụ ya maka ndụ ya.
No smile.	Enweghị ọnụ ọchị.
But now there is a problem.	Ma ugbu a, e nwere nsogbu.
As a result.	N'ihi ya.
The closest road is the worst.	Ụzọ nso kacha njọ.
He was emotional.	O ji mmetụta.
It was great to see him there.	Ọ dị nnọọ ukwuu ịhụ ya n'ebe ahụ.
But that should not be the case.	Ma nke ahụ ekwesịghị ịbụ otú ahụ.
Women actually read men more than men read women.	Ụmụ nwanyị na-agụ ụmụ nwoke n'ezie karịa ka ụmụ nwoke na-agụ ụmụ nwanyị.
He said come tomorrow.	Ọ sị ka echi bịa.
He does not demand of us good.	Ọ dịghị achọ anyị ihe ọma.
But that did not make it any better.	Mana nke ahụ emeghị ka ọ dị mma.
It does not taste good at first.	Ọ naghị atọ ụtọ ịga nke ọma na mbụ.
Tomorrow he may have another hope.	Echi o nwere ike inwe olileanya ọzọ.
Here you can see two different ideas.	N'ebe a, ị nwere ike ịhụ echiche abụọ dị iche.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị njọ na nke ahụ.
It's really good.	Ọ dị mma n'ezie.
Maybe he thinks of a second.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ na-eche echiche nke abụọ.
Those words are true.	Okwu ndị ahụ bụ eziokwu.

Of course, we did not.	Nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na anyị emeghị otú ahụ.
That is famous.	Nke ahụ bụ ama.
If anything, they seem stronger than ever.	Ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla, ha yiri ike karịa ka ọ dị na mbụ.
You will be an important person in the community.	Ị ga-abụ onye dị mkpa na obodo.

He can use balls for anything.	O nwere ike iji bọọlụ mee ihe ọ bụla.
He does not like a baby.	Nwa ọhụrụ adịghị amasị ya.
It is important.	Ọ dị mkpa.
Children are bad.	Ụmụaka dị njọ.

It is something he has been thinking for a long time.	Ọ bụ ihe ọ nọ na-eche kemgbe.

He speaks only for himself now.	Ọ na-ekwu naanị maka onwe ya ugbu a.

And of course he wants coffee.	Na n'ezie ọ na-achọ kọfị.

Trees are the main source of food.	Osisi bụ isi ebe nri.

The place has a great need for planning.	Ebe ahụ nwere nnukwu mkpa atụmatụ.
This is very important.	Nke a dị ezigbo mkpa.

This upset our mother.	Nke a were nne anyị iwe.
There is not much more to say.	Enweghị ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ ikwu.

Either something that scared them or worse.	Ma ọ́ bụghị ihe ọ bụla tụrụ ha ụjọ ma ọ bụ nke ka njọ.

Four hours went by.	Awa anọ gara n'ihu.

You want to be free.	Ị chọrọ inwe onwe gị.
I ran the race with another couple.	M gbara ọsọ ahụ na di na nwunye ọzọ.
All is well.	Ihe niile dị mma.
Everything seemed easy at the time.	Ihe niile yiri ka ọ dị mfe n'oge ahụ.

Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ bụ ihe ọzọ mere ha, ụdị ya, ji nwee ihe ịga nke ọma.
Both are doing well.	Ha abụọ na-eme nke ọma.
So now it’s a market.	Ya mere ugbu a ọ bụ ahịa.
But this time it looks like we are there.	Ma n'oge a, ọ dị ka anyị nọ ebe ahụ.

I think a lot of people want it to be.	Echere m na ọtụtụ ndị chọrọ ka ọ bụrụ.
Or make dinner.	Ma ọ bụ na-eme nri abalị.
Life is very difficult.	Ndụ siri ezigbo ike.
It was called for many years.	A kpọrọ ya ọtụtụ afọ.
So the third and the fourth.	Ya mere, nke atọ na nke anọ.
Maybe it will help you when the weather is bad this winter.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ ga-enyere gị aka mgbe ihu igwe dị njọ n'oge oyi a.
And not just because he is your customer.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị n'ihi na ọ bụ onye ahịa gị.
Have a lunch meeting with your friend.	Gị na enyi gị nwee nzukọ nri ehihie.
I want that worse.	Achọrọ m nke ahụ njọ.
A year or two in the industry.	Otu afọ ma ọ bụ abụọ na ụlọ ọrụ.
Police told residents to stay indoors.	Ndị uwe ojii gwara ndị bi ebe ahụ ka ha nọrọ n'ime ụlọ.
Let’s give them a second chance !.	Ka anyị nye ha ohere nke abụọ!.
Baby bed linen.	Nwata akwa akwa akwa.
About three.	Ihe dị ka atọ.
If we are here, we are here.	Ọ bụrụ na anyị nọ ebe a, anyị nọ ebe a.
For me, eating is a big deal.	Maka m, iri nri bụ nnukwu ihe.
Not calling me.	Ọ bụghị ịkpọ m.
Of course, you have little to do with that.	N'ezie, ọ nweghị ọtụtụ ihe ị ga-eme na nke ahụ.
We do not know what happened to you.	Anyị agaghị ama ihe mere gị.
But they make us who we are.	Ma ha na-eme ka anyị bụrụ ndị anyị bụ.
As many people as one can.	Ọtụtụ mmadụ dị ka mmadụ nwere ike.
But now we both have so much more.	Ma ugbu a, anyị abụọ nwere ọtụtụ ihe ndị ọzọ.
You will do well.	Ị ga-eme nke ọma.
Now they are doing both at the same time.	Ugbu a, ha na-eme ha abụọ n'otu oge.
People take a lot of medications for different purposes.	Ndị mmadụ na-aṅụ ọtụtụ ọgwụ maka ihe dị iche iche.
It says one of us.	Ọ na-ekwu otu n'ime anyị.
Then we can really hope.	Mgbe ahụ n'ezie anyị nwere ike inwe olileanya.
But he didn't want to tell me anything else.	Ma ọ chọghị ịgwa m ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
It doesn't do much.	Ọ naghị eme ọtụtụ ihe.
There are two main reasons for this.	Enwere isi ihe abụọ kpatara nke a.
They would like to believe this.	Ọ ga-amasị ha ka ha kwere nke a.
Just a high point.	Naanị isi ihe dị elu.
It is very busy.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ọrụ.
These are just feelings of mine.	Ndị a bụ naanị mmetụta nke m.
But no one knows.	Ma ọ dịghị onye maara.
Proceed immediately.	Gaa n'ihu ozugbo.
He thought he would go to the window.	Ọ chere na ọ ga-aga na windo.
Until school started.	Ruo mgbe ụlọ akwụkwọ malitere.
People who know you.	Ndị maara gị.
My life is not mine.	Ndụ m abụghị nke m.
It's not the way to tell the truth.	Ọ bụghị ụdị nke ị ga-esi na-ekwu eziokwu.
We do not know how.	Anyị amaghị otú.
I have done nothing wrong.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọjọọ m mere.
One cannot have one without the other.	Enweghị ike inwe otu na-enweghị nke ọzọ.
You will all go.	Unu niile ga-aga.
There are a lot of negatives in this situation.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe adịghị mma na ọnọdụ a.
They thought they had only three.	Ha chere na ọ bụ naanị ihe atọ ka ha nwere.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Ma eleghị anya, otu ụbọchị, ma ọ bụghị ma.
It won't be long now.	Ọ gaghị adị ogologo oge ugbu a.
At the time, we could have two opinions.	N'oge ahụ, anyị nwere ike inwe echiche abụọ.
He would like it.	Ọ ga-amasị ya.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
They liked it.	Ha masịrị ya.
However, not at the door.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị n'ọnụ ụzọ.
Some of them are bright.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ha gbara agba.
No one believed his story.	Ọ dịghị onye kwere akụkọ ya.
This gave him a few moments to think before moving on.	Nke a nyere ya oge ole na ole iche echiche tupu ọ gaa n'ihu.
Certainly not.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị ya kpatara ya.
He thought of me.	O chere banyere m.
These ears are not mine.	Ntị ndị a abụghị m.
Every company has a well.	Ụlọ ọrụ ọ bụla nwere nke ọma.
You know you want to.	Ị maara na ị chọrọ.
They will do different things there.	Ha ga-eme ihe dị iche iche ebe ahụ.
That is the problem.	Nke ahụ bụ nsogbu.
Somehow, this is true.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, nke a bụ eziokwu.
We have nothing to say about why we do this.	Ọ dịghị ihe anyị kwuru banyere ihe mere anyị ji eme nke a.
I have a name.	Enwere m aha.
I do not know everything about the time.	Amaghị m ihe niile gbasara oge ahụ.
I think this is a really unique idea.	Echere m na nke a bụ echiche pụrụ iche n'ezie.
He is a very handsome man.	Ọ bụ nwoke mara mma nke ukwuu.
Only information required.	Naanị ozi na-achọ.
We all need trees and shrubs.	Osisi na osisi dị anyị niile mkpa.
That is not us.	Nke ahụ abụghị anyị.
It's not just men.	Ọ bụghị naanị ụmụ nwoke.

Parents know their child better than anyone else.	Ndị nne na nna maara nwa ha karịa onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
I will not be ready.	Agaghị m adị njikere.
We should not be.	Anyị ekwesịghị ịbụ.
It's very limited.	O nwere oke oke.
Not knowing what to do is wrong.	Amaghị ihe na-eme adịghị mma.
Their children are like your children.	Ụmụ ha dị ka ụmụ gị.
You can't do this to your loved one.	Ị gaghị eme onye ị hụrụ n'anya ihe a.
You have it close.	Ị nwere ya nso.
As you said, today is my birthday.	Dị ka i kwuru, taa bụ ụbọchị ihu ọma m.
Great plan.	Nnukwu atụmatụ.
I will not go for long.	Agaghị m aga ogologo oge.

I will not do that.	Agaghị m eme nke ahụ.
We know it’s not all money for us.	Anyị maara na ọ bụghị ego niile maka anyị.
It really tastes good.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ n'ezie.
It should go right.	Ọ kwesịrị ịga na nri.
There are no recent reports on the page.	Enweghị akụkọ na nso nso a na ibe.
He had a reason.	Ọ nwere ihe kpatara ya.
You can do anything else.	Ị nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
But now it is not there.	Ma ugbu a, ọ bụghị n'ebe ahụ.
We spent time together.	Anyị nọrọ oge ọnụ.
One can take very little space in it.	Mmadụ nwere ike were obere ohere na ya.
It was just a game, he told himself again.	Ọ bụ naanị egwuregwu, ọ gwara onwe ya ọzọ.
It was not good then.	Ọ dịghị mma n'oge ahụ.
They, too, were alone.	Ha, mụ onwe anyị, anyị nọrọ naanị anyị.
His wife was drowned.	Mmiri riri nwunye ya.
Something else seems to be going wrong.	Ihe ọzọ yiri ihe na-adịghị mma.
I can not find the cause.	Enweghị m ike ịchọta ihe kpatara ya.
I think it's weird.	Echere m na ọ bụ egwu egwu.
He ate his favorite food.	O riri nri kacha amasị ya.
I am his student.	Abụ m nwa akwụkwọ ya.
Not our problem.	Ọ bụghị nsogbu anyị.
Its heat seemed unbearable and well-known, at the same time.	Okpomọkụ ya dị ka ihe na-adịghị mma ma mara nke ọma, n'otu oge ahụ.
Now is not the time.	Ugbu a abụghị oge.
You know the feeling when you are scared or interested.	Ị maara mmetụta ahụ mgbe ụjọ na-atụ gị ma ọ bụ nwee mmasị.
Within minutes, police arrived at the scene.	N’ime nkeji ole na ole, ndị uwe ojii bịara n’ebe ihe ahụ mere.
He refuses to do so.	Ọ jụrụ ime otú ahụ.
He talked for hours about his anger.	O kwuru ọtụtụ awa banyere iwe ya.
Because they will never know.	N'ihi na ha agaghị ama ma ọlị.
This is the time to act.	Nke a bụ oge ime ihe.
This is awesome.	Nke a dị egwu.
Despite this ability, three important questions remain.	N'agbanyeghị ikike a, ajụjụ atọ dị mkpa ka dị.
They are all women.	Ha niile bụ ụmụ nwanyị.
Our family.	Ezinụlọ anyị.
I do not want your money.	Achọghị m ego gị.
I do not know the type.	Amaghị m ụdị.
You look very pretty.	Ị mara ezigbo mma.
I do not want it.	Achọghị m ya.
Work all day.	Na-arụ ọrụ ụbọchị niile.
He was shocked.	O juru ya obi.
This is just one thing.	Nke a bụ naanị otu ihe.
I am like his livestock.	M dị ka anụ ụlọ ya.
Everyone has them.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ha.
I love you so much.	Ahụrụ m gị n'anya nke ukwuu.
That's not it.	Nke ahụ abụghị ya.
The patient feels completely well for a long time.	Onye ọrịa ahụ na-enwe mmetụta zuru oke ruo ogologo oge.
To say the least.	Ikwu kacha nta.
The room is cold.	Ime ụlọ ahụ jụrụ oyi.
They have a company name.	Ha nwere aha ụlọ ọrụ.
I did not look inside.	Eleghị m anya n'ime.
Again it is very strange.	Ọzọ ọ bụ nnọọ anya.
See what they are doing there.	Hụ ihe ha na-eme n'ebe ahụ.
I have to play.	Ekwesịrị m igwu egwu.
I will not be here.	Agaghị m anọ ebe a.
This song is fun.	Egwu a na-atọ ụtọ.
It can hurt me.	O nwere ike ime m ihe.
This is the first time he will come.	Nke a bụ oge mbụ ọ ga-abịa.
These things aren't wrong.	Ihe ndị a adịghị njọ.
I feel good.	Ọ dị m ka ọ̀ dị mma.
But not a car like this.	Mana ọ bụghị ụgbọ ala dị ka nke a.
This is my new one.	Nke a bụ ọhụrụ m.
Interviewees said they were not happy.	Ndị gbara ajụjụ ọnụ kwuru na obi adịghị ha ụtọ.
Nice to have here.	Ọ dị mma inwe ebe a.
The court is.	Ụlọ ikpe bụ.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
But he does not talk to me.	Ma ọ naghị agwa m okwu.
I do not know anyone like that.	Amaghị m onye ọ bụla dị otú ahụ.
They are afraid of the law.	Ha na-atụ iwu egwu.
Life is a long vacation.	Ndụ bụ otu ezumike dị ogologo.
They knew the feeling when it came, however.	Ha maara mmetụta ahụ mgbe ọ bịara, Otú ọ dị.
Does he have a wife or a child?	O nwere nwunye ma ọ bụ nwa?
Food, the best.	Nri, kacha mma.
They are more than that.	Ha ka nke ahụ.
There is no other reason.	Ọ nweghị ihe ọzọ kpatara ya.
The other is very small.	Nke ọzọ dị nnọọ obere.
What happens, he said.	Ihe na-eme, o kwuru.
For some.	Maka ụfọdụ.
These are two types.	Ndị a bụ ụdị abụọ.
Your new book will be coming soon.	Akwụkwọ ọhụrụ gị ga-abịa n'oge adịghị anya.
He is a great man.	Ọ bụ nnukwu mmadụ.
I do not want to know what will happen to me.	Achọghị m ịma ihe ga-eme m.
I do not know what happens.	Amaghị ihe na-eme.
The man was the only thing he knew.	Nwoke ahụ bụ naanị ihe ọ maara.
There are a lot of good things in the game.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe dị mma na egwuregwu ahụ.
All these examples belong to the family.	Ihe atụ ndị a niile bụ nke ezinụlọ.
Nothing else was done about it.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ e mere banyere ya.
It is very helpful.	Ọ dị ezigbo aka otú ahụ.
They have one daughter.	Ha nwere otu nwa nwanyị.
Talking, or feeling.	Ikwu okwu, ma ọ bụ inwe mmetụta ụfọdụ.
That day is important.	Ụbọchị ahụ dị mkpa.
Most likely this event is small.	O yikarịrị ka ihe omume a dị ntakịrị.
So it is very good.	Ya mere ọ dị ezigbo mma.
Not a challenge.	Ọ bụghị ihe ịma aka.
My daughters are far away, and.	Ụmụ nwanyị m nọ n'ebe dị anya, na.
Time to move on.	Oge ịga n'ihu.
But a few beautiful things happen.	Ma ole na ole mara mma na-eme.
They read the book at night.	Ha na-agụ akwụkwọ ahụ n’abalị.
Maybe it's this.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ a.
It's pretty obvious.	O siri ike doro anya.
We know about it now but.	Anyị maara banyere ya ugbu a ma.
Tell me a joke.	Gwa m ihe ọchị.
A lot has happened since that day.	Ọtụtụ ihe mere kemgbe ụbọchị ahụ.
It is not possible quickly.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume ngwa ngwa.
Doing so will make my life happier.	Ime otú ahụ ọ ga-eme ka ndụ m nwee obi ụtọ.
The word is that this is wrong.	Okwu ahụ bụ na nke a bụ ihe ọjọọ.
When this town was small, there were 12 families.	Mgbe obodo a dị obere, e nwere ezinụlọ iri na abụọ.
I like your opinion.	Echiche gị masịrị m.
Or read about it.	Ma ọ bụ na-agụ banyere ya.
It’s too easy to be any good.	Ọ dị oke mfe ịdị mma ọ bụla.
I don’t want you to think about me.	Achọghị m ka ị na-eche banyere m.
My doctor said it was important to go easy.	Dọkịta m kwuru na ọ dị mkpa ịga n'ụzọ dị mfe.
For me, this works better.	Maka m, nke a na-arụ ọrụ karịa.
I know him better than anyone.	M maara ya karịa onye ọ bụla.
Let me help.	Ka m nyere aka.
If you like variety, try something new every day of the week.	Ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị iche iche, na-agbalị ihe ọhụrụ kwa ụbọchị n'izu.
Seeing the truth can be daunting.	Ịhụ eziokwu nwere ike ịbụ ihe na-atụ egwu.
We can not go without water.	Anyị enweghị ike ịga na-enweghị mmiri.
No one has seen it since.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya kemgbe.
I can't get out of that.	Enweghị m ike ịpụ nke ahụ.
In the summer.	N'ime oge okpomọkụ.
Each room has a large mirror.	Ime ụlọ ọ bụla nwere nnukwu enyo.
However, it is not.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị.
That is the key.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe dị mkpa.
Not for you.	Ọ bụghị maka gị.
I was there like.	Anọ m ebe ahụ dị ka .
Really nice anyway.	N'ezie mara mma n'agbanyeghị.
The reason is theirs.	Ihe kpatara ya bụ nke ha.
One week is only one week.	Otu izu bụ naanị otu izu.
We need to do something.	Anyị kwesịrị ime ihe.
However, it is not a good idea.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị ezigbo echiche.
I need to tell my man.	Ekwesịrị m ịgwa nwoke m.
Until last week.	Ruo izu gara aga.
There is no forgiveness.	Enweghị mgbaghara.
He is reasonable.	O nwere ezi uche.
So let's take it one day at a time.	Ya mere, ka anyị were ya otu ụbọchị n'otu oge.
Most people would see it.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ gaara ahụ ya.
There is nothing special about that.	Ọ dịghị ihe pụrụ iche banyere nke ahụ.
But no one seems to care.	Ma ọ dịghị onye yiri ihe ọ na-eche.
He liked it more than this.	Ọ masịrị ya karịa otu a.
There is nothing wrong with that, of course.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị njọ n'ụzọ ọ dị ya, n'ezie.
Not the first or the second.	Ọ bụghị nke mbụ ma ọ bụ nke abụọ.
Opportunities have a certain effect.	Ohere anyị nwere inwe mmetụta ụfọdụ.
i like dogs	nkịta na-amasị m.
This man is.	Nwoke a bụ.
We were told not to go out.	A gwara anyị ka anyị ghara ịpụ.
Thoughts of more than one leg at a time.	Echiche karịrị otu ụkwụ n'otu oge.
I feel this way.	Enwere m mmetụta nke a.
For some, that is immediate, while for others it may take months.	Maka ụfọdụ, nke ahụ bụ ozugbo, ebe ndị ọzọ ka nwere ike were ọnwa.
Not a good type.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo ụdị.
How many people died in the car accident?	Mmadụ ole nwụrụ n'ihe mberede ụgbọ ala ahụ?
For a while everything remained.	Ruo oge ụfọdụ ihe niile ka dị.
This is a bad plan.	Nke a bụ atụmatụ adịghị mma.
He says it's not time to talk.	O kwuru na oge adịghị mma ikwu okwu.
Enjoy the good and the bad.	Na-atọ ezi ihe ụtọ na ndị ọjọọ.
Tell your friends about it !.	Gwa ndị enyi gị gbasara ya!.
But he needed a company.	Ma ọ chọrọ ụlọ ọrụ.
He may have been right.	O nwere ike ịbụ na o kwuru eziokwu.
He is confident.	Obi siri ya ike.
He saw a head he knew well.	Ọ hụrụ isi ọ maara nke ọma.
It's not about me.	Ọ bụghị gbasara m.
Thanks for your feedback.	Daalụ maka echiche gị.
We stopped it.	Anyị kwụsịrị ya.
I am so happy for you my dear.	Obi dị m ezigbo ụtọ maka gị onye m hụrụ n'anya.
I want everyone to do their job.	Achọrọ m onye ọ bụla na-arụ ọrụ ha.
No heat, no heat.	Enweghị ọkụ, enweghị okpomọkụ.
His mother ordered him to stop.	Nne ya nyere ya iwu ka ọ kwụsị.
But again, by the evil one.	Mana ọzọ, site n'aka onye ọjọọ ahụ.
One of her sons is a doctor.	Otu n'ime ụmụ ya nwoke bụ dọkịta.
That is the amount of money.	Nke ahụ bụ ego ego.
I look forward to it.	Ana m atụ anya ya.
I thought they were right at the time.	Echere m na ha bụ eziokwu n'oge ahụ.
I have two parents.	Enwere m nne na nna abụọ.
He talks about it.	Ọ na-ekwu banyere ya.
They have it coming.	Ha nwere ọ na-abịa.
It was just sleep.	Ọ bụ naanị ụra.
Do it well.	Mee ya nke ọma.
The people are amazed.	O juru ndị obodo ahụ anya.
None of the girls spoke.	Ọ dịghị otu n'ime ụmụ agbọghọ ahụ kwuru okwu.
My children were very happy there.	Ụmụ m nwere nnọọ obi ụtọ n'ebe ahụ.
I would not have gone there.	Agaraghị m ebe ahụ.
He wanted to but could not.	Ọ chọrọ ma ọ nweghị ike ime.
This car is almost brand new.	Ụgbọ ala a fọrọ nke nta ka ọ dị ọhụrụ.
Let me know that.	Ka m mara nke ahụ.
One day his time will come.	Otu ụbọchị oge ya ga-abịa.
Is it dangerous.	Ọ dị egwu.
It will not be fast.	Ọ gaghị adị ngwa ngwa.
Every day of the week is different.	Ụbọchị ọ bụla n'izu dị iche.
They live and work.	Ha bi ebe ha na-arụ ọrụ.
I hope they all feel that way.	Enwere m olileanya na ha niile nwere mmetụta ahụ.
I have no idea.	Enweghị m echiche ọ bụla.
We can't believe it.	Anyị enweghị ike ikweta.
However, we were found.	Otú ọ dị, a hụrụ anyị.
But you understand when others think differently.	Ma ị ghọtara mgbe ndị ọzọ na-eche echiche dị iche.
Swimming can be fun.	Igwu mmiri nwere ike na-atọ ụtọ.
I don't think it happened.	Echeghị m na ọ mere.
At one point, he found someone like him.	N’otu oge, ọ hụrụ onye yiri ya.
One reason is that we do not need it.	Otu ihe kpatara ya bụ na ọ dịghị anyị mkpa.
We are all together.	Anyị niile ọnụ.
The waters of the city began to flow.	Mmiri nke obodo ahụ malitere ịpụ.
The issue here, of course, is money.	Okwu ebe a, n'ezie, bụ ego.
You know what you have there.	Ị maara ihe ị nwere ebe ahụ.
However, there is a way to get around this.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ụzọ ị ga-esi na-agba gburugburu nke a.
I was at work.	Anọ m na-arụ ọrụ.
And his father.	Na nna ya.
A lot of people say he was playing himself.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-ekwu na ọ na-egwu onwe ya.
He has something behind him.	O nwere ihe dị n'azụ ya.
A city with an ancient past or history.	Obodo nwere oge ochie ma ọ bụ akụkọ ihe mere eme gara aga.
My daughter is going.	Nwa m nwanyị ga-aga.
There is no reason to do so at present.	Enweghị ihe kpatara ime nke ahụ ka ọ dị ugbu a.
He still has feelings.	Ọ ka nwere mmetụta.
I know the name.	Amaara m aha ahụ.
He is the head.	Ọ bụ onye isi.
It is a cold day.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị oyi.
City officials are planning to build a taller tower.	Ndị isi obodo na-eme atụmatụ iwu ụlọ elu dị ogologo.
The problem is its leaders.	Nsogbu bụ ndị isi ya.
Not here first.	Ọ bụghị ebe a mbụ.
Not your customers.	Ọ bụghị ndị ahịa gị.
Not by long.	Ọ bụghị site na ogologo oge.
But it has features and functions.	Ma o nwere atụmatụ na ọrụ.
His opinion was rejected.	A jụrụ echiche ya.
The longing for this baby.	Agụụ nwata a tụrụ anya.
Still, he will have it.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ ga-eme ya.
However, their practices are good.	Otú ọ dị, ihe ndị ha na-eme dị mma.
But there is more than one kind of success.	Mana enwere ụdị ihe ịga nke ọma karịa otu.
You make your own clothes, you know.	Ị na-eme uwe nke gị, ị maara.
At least, not to him.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, ọ bụghị n'ebe ọ nọ.
I do not know anyone here.	Amaghị m onye ọ bụla nọ ebe a.
Anything will happen.	Nke ọ bụla ga-eme.
Tonight will be better.	Abalị taa ga-adị mma.
It doesn't have to be this way.	O kwesịghị ịdị otú ahụ.
Everyone took a good look.	Onye ọ bụla lere anya nke ọma.
Every day is.	Ụbọchị ọ bụla bụ.
He can do it.	O nwere ike ime ya.
One of your girls.	Otu n'ime ụmụ agbọghọ gị.
Let me know as it goes.	Mee ya ka m mara ka ọ na-aga.
Let's take this for a moment.	Ka anyị were nke a nwa oge.
Lots of fun activities.	Ọtụtụ omume na-atọ ụtọ.
They believe him, and he speaks.	Ha kwere ya isi, o wee na-ekwu okwu.
They hurried to the front door.	Ha gara ngwa ngwa chere ihu n'ọnụ ụzọ.
She has three children.	O nwere ụmụ atọ.
That is a fact of life.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu doro anya.
He is a great man.	Ọ bụ nnukwu mmadụ.
The story is an example of its authenticity.	Akụkọ ahụ bụ ihe atụ maka eziokwu ya.
It's too strong.	O siri ike nke ukwuu.
No it.	Mba ya.
It took a year.	O were otu afọ.
But only two more weeks, really.	Mana ọ bụ naanị izu abụọ ọzọ, ezigbo.
I don’t have any emotional feelings about it right now.	Enweghị m mmetụta mmetụta ọ bụla banyere ya ugbu a.
All he needed was sleep.	Ihe dị ya mkpa bụ ụra.
It is our happy hope.	Ọ bụ olileanya anyị dị ụtọ.
I would like to see a photo of him.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịhụ foto ya.
I can visualize the situation.	Enwere m ike iji anya nke uche hụ ọnọdụ ahụ.
May I be the first to see ?.	Enwere m ike ịbụ onye mbụ ịhụ?.
Which you can do.	Nke ị nwere ike ime.
No one wants this.	Ọ dịghị onye chọrọ ihe a.
More than a dozen cities.	Ihe karịrị obodo iri na abụọ.
That does not matter.	Nke ahụ adịghị mkpa.
You love me!	Ị hụrụ m n'anya!
I will be strong for kids.	M ga-adị ike maka ụmụaka.
He left the room.	Ọ hapụrụ ime ụlọ.
Again, the same thing.	Ọzọ, otu ihe ahụ.
My boyfriend thought it was awesome.	Enyi m nwoke chere na ọ dị egwu.
In time, everyone knew I would move on.	Ka oge na-aga, onye ọ bụla maara m ga-aga n'ihu.
But please help.	Mana biko nyere aka.
He falls in front of her.	Ọ dara n'ihu ya.
When asked, he had other plans.	Mgbe a jụrụ ha, o nwere atụmatụ ndị ọzọ.
Somehow, none of these things impressed me.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a masịrị m.
They cooked a delicious meal.	Ha siri nri dị ụtọ.
There will never be a better time.	Ọ dịghị mgbe a ga-enwe oge ka mma.
It's better to have something '.	Ọ ka mma inwe ihe'.
Without it, you cannot do it.	Enweghị ya, ị nweghị ike ime ya.
You have a bad person.	Ị nwere onye ọjọọ.
They were waiting for him.	Ha nọ na-eche ya.
But you do it.	Ma ị na-eme ya.
This time belongs to him.	Oge a bụ nke ya.
Only the first.	Naanị nke mbụ.
That is who we want to be.	Nke ahụ bụ onye anyị chọrọ ịbụ.
He looks like a father who would like to have a son.	Ọ dị ka nna ọ ga-amasị ya inwe.
Another long shot.	Ogologo ogologo ọzọ ọzọ.
I can't see his face.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ihu ya.
And absolutely impossible.	Na n'ụzọ zuru oke enweghị ike.
What happened was fun.	Ihe merenụ na-atọ ụtọ.
It's really something.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ihe.
They are the same question.	Ha bụ otu ajụjụ ahụ.
They are there.	Ha nọ ebe ahụ.
But this can be worth it.	Ma nke a nwere ike ịbụ ọnụ ahịa.
He could tell her this.	O nwere ike ịgwa ya ihe a.
Another time will not be different.	Oge ọzọ agaghị adị iche.
The man liked it.	Nwoke ahụ masịrị ya.
So another situation, they are at home.	Ya mere ọnọdụ ọzọ, ha nọ n'ụlọ.
I don't want men.	Achọghị m ụmụ nwoke.
Working fast now.	Na-arụ ọrụ ngwa ngwa ugbu a.
They do not eat it.	Ha anaghị eri ya.
He is very worried.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya nke ukwuu.
The weather is beautiful !.	Ihu igwe mara mma!.
That's fine, he thought.	Nke ahụ dị mma, o chere.
He is in it.	Ọ nọ n'ime ya.
Each company’s work is very different.	Ọrụ ụlọ ọrụ ọ bụla dị nnọọ iche.
I don't really know why.	Amaghị m ihe kpatara ya n'ezie.
Alive or dead.	Dị ndụ ma ọ bụ nwụrụ anwụ.
He liked fast.	Ọsọ ọsọ masịrị ya.
Or really.	Ma ọ bụ n'ezie.
But not a child.	Ma ọ bụghị nwa.
Each one is unique.	Nke ọ bụla pụrụ iche.
He is very stupid, of course.	Ọ bụ nnọọ onye nzuzu, n'ezie.
Have fun riding !.	Nwee obi ụtọ ịnya!.
There are about 20 of them.	Ha dị ihe dị ka iri abụọ.
It's so beautiful in your hand.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu n'aka gị.
If it is likely to happen.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ ga-abụ ọ ga-eme.
But it is not good.	Ma ọ dịghị mma.
He never got a chance.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ nwetara ohere.
You have to make money.	Ị ga-eme ka ego.
It's too strong.	O siri ike nke ukwuu.
Everyone knows the situation.	Onye ọ bụla maara ọnọdụ ahụ.
The question, of course, is when.	Ajụjụ, n'ezie, bụ mgbe.
This really frightened him.	Nke a tụrụ ya ụjọ n'ezie.
When he was happy, he knew it.	Mgbe obi dị ya ụtọ, ọ maara ya.
If you can find one.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike ịchọta otu.

So you can use it quickly.	Ya mere ị nwere ike iji ya mee ihe ngwa ngwa.
Still looking for something.	Ka na-achọ ihe.
He is here tonight.	Ọ nọ ebe a n'abalị a.
If you know the way, tell us.	Ọ bụrụ na ị maara ụzọ, gwa anyị.
Sometimes things go well, but sometimes they do not.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ihe na-aga nke ọma, ma mgbe ụfọdụ ọ naghị adị.
Really?	N'ezie?
Take action.	Mee ihe.
For a new life, she probably had a new dress.	Maka ndụ ọhụrụ, ọ ga-abụ na o nwere uwe ọhụrụ.
You think a lot.	Ị na-eche nke ukwuu.
That is not what he said.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe o kwuru.
A good night's sleep is good for health.	Ezigbo ụra abalị dị mma maka ahụ ike.
They sat there for a long minute.	Ha nọdụ otu ahụ ruo ogologo nkeji.
Tomorrow morning, baby.	Ụtụtụ echi, nwa.
I do not have that.	Anaghị m enwe nke ahụ.
There is really little benefit for them.	Enwere n'ezie ntakịrị uru maka ha.
Money helped, but not alone.	Ego nyere aka, ma ọ bụghị naanị ya.
These workers do not feel valued by their employer.	Ndị ọrụ a echeghị na onye were ha n'ọrụ ji ha kpọrọ ihe.
He has a history of mental illness.	O nwere akụkọ ihe mere eme nke ọrịa uche.

But this feels worse.	Ma nke a na-eche ka njọ.
I want to do this for everyone.	Achọrọ m ime nke a maka onye ọ bụla.
The current legal situation is very different.	Ọnọdụ ikpe dị ugbu a dị nnọọ iche.
Seeing you that you are not.	Ịhụ gị na anọghị gị.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.

It is impossible to do so.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume ime otú ahụ.
I think this is true.	Echere m na nke a bụ eziokwu.
People say a lot.	Ndị mmadụ na-ekwu ọtụtụ ihe.
This is for the country.	Nke a bụ maka mba.
It will help work.	Ọ ga-enyere aka ọrụ.
He loves them very much.	Ọ hụrụ ha n'anya nke ukwuu.
I think it is fun.	Echere m na ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
As soon as he wanted to not do it.	Ozugbo ọ chọrọ ka ọ ghara ime ya.
We should have that.	Anyị kwesịrị inwe nke ahụ.
It is very fast.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ọsọ.
The weather is better at this time of year.	Oge ihu igwe ka mma n'oge a n'afọ.
Things are not right.	Ihe adịghị mma.
She has a son.	O nwere nwa nwoke.
You need a vacation.	Ị chọrọ ezumike.
He was amazed that everything was so simple.	O juru ya anya ka ihe niile dị mfe.
The disease is running out.	Ọrịa na-agba ọsọ.
It is very cold.	Ọ dị ezigbo oyi.
We seem to have the same idea.	Ọ dị ka anyị nwere otu echiche.
He should be at home now.	O kwesịrị ịdị n'ụlọ ugbu a.
She has a way with the boys.	Ya na ụmụ nwoke nwere ụzọ.
I can cook.	Enwere m ike esi nri.
John was a reasonable man.	Jọn bụ nwoke nwere ezi uche.
She is very happy, this girl.	Ọ bụ ezigbo obi ụtọ, nwa agbọghọ a.
We want to do something about that.	Anyị chọrọ ime ihe banyere nke ahụ.
It paused for a moment.	Ọ kwụsịrị nwa oge.
They are good at that.	Ha dị mma na nke ahụ.
You know the plan.	Ị maara atụmatụ ahụ.
Well, a little more.	Ọ dị mma, ntakịrị ntakịrị karịa.
Much bigger than it looks in this picture.	Ọtụtụ ibu karịa ka ọ dị na foto a.
But the same old problem still exists.	Ma otu nsogbu ochie ahụ ka dị.
Other families will be safe.	Ezinụlọ ndị ọzọ agaghị anọ n'ihe egwu.
He ran as fast as he could.	Ọ gbara ọsọ ka o nwere ike.
He has no friends here.	O nweghị enyi ebe a.
I do this with her several times.	Mụ na ya na-eme nke a ọtụtụ ugboro.
The car has only four wheels.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ nwere naanị ụkwụ anọ.
Maybe if he just told her.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụrụ nnọọ na ọ gwara ya .
I invite you to sit next to me.	M kpọrọ gị ka ị nọdụ n'akụkụ m.
The other is just his job.	Ihe ọzọ bụ naanị ọrụ ya.
He will do it himself.	Ọ ga-eme ya n'onwe ya.
Certainly not the case.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị ụdị ihe ahụ.
But they didn't do it the way we did.	Ma ha emeghị ya ka anyị na-eme.
But there he was, the same.	Ma n'ebe ahụ ọ nọ, otu ahụ.
I can not know a little!	Apụghị m ịma ntakịrị!
He loved her, loved their lives.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya, hụrụ ndụ ha n'anya.
Take a break and run today.	Were ezumike na ịgba ọsọ taa.
But it is not good.	Ma ọ dịghị mma.
I know it well now.	Amaara m nke ọma ugbu a.
It has a different plan.	Ọ nwere atụmatụ dị iche.
His story is true.	Akụkọ ya bụ eziokwu.
This is from the president.	Nke a si n'aka onye isi ala.
The game can make it beautiful.	Egwuregwu ahụ nwere ike ime ka ọ mara mma.
The sea! 	Oke osimiri!
.	.
This story makes a community story.	Akụkọ a na-eme akụkọ obodo.
He was amazed at the thought.	Echiche ahụ juru ya anya.
It is a rural area with many different shops.	Ọ bụ ime obodo nwere ọtụtụ ụlọ ahịa dị iche iche.
I tried to tell them.	M gbalịrị ịgwa ha.
But the law is there.	Mana iwu dị ebe ahụ.
We are court officials.	Anyị bụ ndị ọrụ ụlọ ikpe.
What matters is a new approach to this issue.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ ụzọ ọhụrụ maka okwu a.
He is ready for this.	Ọ dị njikere maka nke a.
Everyone is different.	Onye ọ bụla dị iche.
He gave a long lecture about the weekend away.	O nyere ogologo nkuzi gbasara izu ụka pụọ.
That moment was perfect.	Oge ahụ zuru oke.
I don’t know what to do here.	Amaghị m ihe m ga-eme ebe a.
But what if it was me.	Ma gịnị ma ọ bụrụ na ọ bụ m.
There is no work in your life.	Enweghị ọrụ na ndụ gị.
No, they do not.	Mba, ha anaghị eme ya.
I would love to help him.	M gaara achọ inyere ya aka.
He was young, new to no power at all.	Ọ bụ nwata, ọ dị ọhụrụ nke enweghị ike ọ bụla.
Many are looking for more time.	Ọtụtụ na-achọ oge ọzọ.
The city is on fire.	Ọkụ gbara obodo ahụ.
They know a lot about each other.	Ha maara ọtụtụ ihe banyere ibe ha.
Not worth the money.	Ọ bụghị ọnụ ahịa ego.
That happens, often.	Nke ahụ na-eme, ọtụtụ mgbe.
These are given.	E nyere ndị a.
Every day of its own.	Kwa ụbọchị nke ya.
As never.	Dị ka ọ dịghị mgbe.
Continue in this round.	Gaa n'ihu na nke a gburugburu.
The game goes round and round.	Egwuregwu ahụ na-aga gburugburu.
Children do not go to school.	Ụmụaka anaghị aga ụlọ akwụkwọ.
But that's not the worst.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị nke kacha njọ.
The city is surrounded by cities.	Obodo gbara obodo ahụ gburugburu.
That is it, of course.	Nke ahụ bụ ya, n'ezie.
Is that too fast ?.	Nke ahụ ọ dị oke ọsọ?.
I saw the problem.	Ahụrụ m nsogbu ahụ.
Everything is real.	Ihe niile dị adị.
They are both boys.	Ha abụọ bụ ụmụ nwoke.
I'm sure that is.	Eji m n'aka na nke ahụ bụ.
It was a good interview.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ajụjụ ọnụ.
It's really good.	Ọ dị mma n'ezie.
It's not a lie.	Ọ bụghị ụgha.
That was his game.	Nke ahụ bụ egwuregwu ya.
That is why.	Ọ bụ ya kpatara ya.
But not his time, not his time.	Ma ọ bụghị oge ya, ọ bụghị oge ya.
He played the best game of his life.	Ọ gbara egwuregwu kacha mma na ndụ ya .
But it doesn't seem to be what you think.	Ma ọ dịghị ka ihe ị na-eche.
They are fast asleep.	Ụra na-ama ha nke ukwuu.
Really, really good.	N'ezie, ezigbo mma.
The application is useless.	Ngwa ahụ enweghị isi.
Before it.	Tupu ya.
My mind raced.	Uche m gbara ọsọ.
Each ship has four crew members.	Ụgbọ mmiri ọ bụla nwere ndị ọrụ anọ.
If you are good, you will be good.	Ọ bụrụ na ị dị mma, ọ ga-adị gị mma.
Good food and hard work.	Ezi nri na ọrụ siri ike.
But this is not just my opinion.	Ma nke a abụghị naanị echiche m.
Come and get it!.	Bịa were ya!.
The case is different.	Ikpe ahụ dị iche.
Many.	Ọtụtụ ahụ.
One way forward.	Otu ụzọ na-aga n'ihu.
Because of their mental capacity.	N'ihi ike uche ha.
I saw both of them this weekend.	Ahụrụ m ha abụọ n'izu ụka a.
Why is that? 	Gịnị kpatara ya?
he asked himself.	ọ jụrụ onwe ya.
This is not good but it is not good.	Nke a adịghị mma ma ọ bụghị mma.
That, of course, is beautiful.	N'ezie, nke ahụ mara mma n'ezie.
Tears welled up in his eyes.	Anya mmiri gbara ya n'ihu.
It is good and true in itself.	Ọ dị mma na eziokwu n'onwe ya.
Be aware of the latest.	Maara na nke ọhụrụ.
He is a good citizen.	Ọ bụ ezigbo onye mba.
He thought it was all his eyes on her.	O chere na ọ bụ anya ya niile n'anya ya.
You feel one way and feel another.	Ị na-eche otu ụzọ ma na-enwe mmetụta ọzọ.
Only a few people have this problem.	Naanị mmadụ ole na ole na-enwe nsogbu a.
No, it's better.	Mba, ọ ka mma.
Which is what it is.	Nke bụ ihe ọ bụ.
No game should.	Enweghị egwuregwu kwesịrị.
It will be huge.	Ọ ga-abụ nnukwu.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
Then he left.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ hapụrụ ya.
I don’t work for parents.	Anaghị m arụ ọrụ maka ndị nne na nna.
Another dog problem.	Nsogbu nkịta ọzọ.
But nothing seems to work.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe yiri ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
No one else can do it.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ nwere ike ime ya.
I do not know what happened.	Amaghị m ihe merenụ.
He knew nothing, of course, he was still young.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ bụla, n'ezie, ọ ka dị obere.
I do this over and over again.	Ana m eme nke a ugboro ugboro.
No, he should not.	Mba, o kwesịghị ime ya.
Now, I don't need to.	Ugbu a, ọ naghị adị m mkpa.
He said he had something to tell us about it.	O kwuru na ya nwere ihe ọ chọrọ ịgwa anyị banyere ya.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
All other minds go backwards.	Uche ndị ọzọ niile na-aga n'azụ.
I deserve it.	Ekwesịrị m ya.
Have a spirit close to you.	Nwee mmụọ nso gị.
Sometimes we do not see anything.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, anyị anaghị ahụ ihe ọ bụla.
Get me a car.	Nweta m ụgbọ ala.
The food is still fresh for two or four weeks.	Nri ahụ ka dị ọhụrụ ruo izu abụọ ma ọ bụ anọ.
But it was not because he often spoke the truth.	Ma ọ bụghị n'ihi na o kwuru eziokwu ọtụtụ oge.
Up and down.	Elu na elu.
This is my life.	Nke a bụ ndụ m.
They have a chance.	Ha nwere ohere.
It works well there.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma ebe ahụ.
No, that is not good.	Mba, nke ahụ adịghị mma.
Everything is when they are young.	Ihe niile bụ mgbe ha dị obere.
He looked in front of the policeman.	O lere anya n'ihu onye uwe ojii ahụ.
Are you currently living in the building?	Ị bụ onye bi na ụlọ ahụ ugbu a?
It is only flesh for it.	Ọ bụ naanị anụ ahụ maka ya.
Such men.	Ụmụ nwoke dị otú ahụ.
I don't feel better than laughter most of the time now.	Iwe anaghị adị m mma karịa ihe ọchị ọtụtụ oge ugbu a.
The night was packed.	Abalị ahụ juru ebe niile.
He wanted to play the game.	Ọ chọrọ ime egwuregwu ahụ.
Some are really good.	Ụfọdụ dị ezigbo mma n'ezie.
Not two, not three.	Ọ bụghị abụọ, ọ bụghị atọ.
He was a man like me.	Ọ bụ mmadụ dị ka m.
They fell in love.	Ha malitere ịhụ ibe ha n’anya.
I was in tears.	Anya mmiri juru m anya.
I saw it for the first time.	M hụrụ ya na nke mbụ ya.
I did not see.	Ahụghị m.
He is looking for a good home.	Ọ na-achọ ezigbo ụlọ.
Some brands are awesome.	Ụfọdụ ụdị dị oke egwu.
The city is now known as a tourist destination.	Obodo a ma ama ugbu a dị ka ebe ndị njem na-aga.
I know myself.	Amaara m onwe m.
He loves her very much.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
All our thoughts, and that.	Echiche anyị niile, na nke ahụ.
This is a big difference in our study.	Nke a bụ nnukwu ihe dị iche na ọmụmụ ihe anyị.
I do not want much from them.	Achọghị m ọtụtụ ihe n'aka ha.
These shoes are really beautiful.	Akpụkpọ ụkwụ ndị a mara mma n'ezie.
Obviously not the key to the situation.	Nke doro anya na ọ bụghị isi ihe dị na ọnọdụ ahụ.
Go and buy it, now.	Gaa zụta ya, ugbu a.
He did not seem happy to be there.	O yighị ka obi dị ya ụtọ ịnọ ebe ahụ.
These have an immediate effect.	Ndị a na-enwe mmetụta ngwa ngwa.
Her body is beautiful, but not beautiful.	Ahụ ya mara mma, ma ọ dịghị mma.
It may not be the same.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ otu.
This one is not.	Nke a enweghị otu.
I only saw him a few times.	Ahụrụ m ya naanị ugboro ole na ole.
I love my country.	Ahụrụ m obodo m n'anya.
They shot him.	Ha gbara ya.
What we heard.	Ihe anyị nụrụ.
I have a room.	Enwere m ụlọ.
I do not want to make it easy.	Achọghị m ime ka ọ dị mfe.
But this is really good.	Mana nke a dị oke mma n'ezie.
Well, he said again.	Ọ dị mma, o kwuru ọzọ.
It should be all that.	O kwesịrị ịbụ ihe ahụ niile.
We think this is a very difficult question.	Anyị chere na nke a bụ ajụjụ siri ezigbo ike.
There is no rest.	Enweghị izu ike.
It will not be a school.	Ọ gaghị abụ ụlọ akwụkwọ.
That is beyond me.	Nke ahụ karịrị m.
We all know the story.	Anyị niile maara akụkọ ahụ.
There are four seasons a year.	Enwere oge anọ n'afọ.
Someone knows what happened.	Onye ma ihe merenụ.
He pointed to one.	Ọ tụrụ aka n'otu.
And not going there.	Na agaghị aga ebe ahụ.
But he knew that was not the reason he had stopped there.	Ma ọ ma na ọ bụghị ya mere o ji kwụsị ebe ahụ.
For us today this is a major challenge.	N'ebe anyị nọ taa nke a bụ nnukwu ihe isi ike.
He was waiting for her.	Ọ nọ na-eche ya.
The policeman found the man.	Onye uwe ojii ahụ hụrụ nwoke ahụ.
They are close by.	Ha nọ nke ya nso.
But he is not afraid of that.	Ma ọ dịghị atụ egwu nke ahụ.
The women are happy.	Ụmụ nwanyị ahụ nwere obi ụtọ.
This is bigger.	Nke a ka ibu.
There is no way around it.	Ọ nweghị ụzọ gbara ya gburugburu.
People are still running it.	Ndị mmadụ ka na-agba ya.
Not much.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu.
Most people do it more than once.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-eme ya ihe karịrị otu ugboro.
I can't find these words.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ okwu ndị a.
I will not shop there.	Agaghị m azụ ahịa ebe ahụ.
There is nothing there.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla n'ebe ahụ.
Each practice has important implications.	Omume ọ bụla nwere mmetụta dị mkpa.
But it's like being fourteen more.	Ma ọ dị ka ịbụ iri na anọ ọzọ.
I would like to be hungry and something that makes me happy.	Ọ ga-amasị m inwe agụụ na ihe na-eme m obi ụtọ.
Some of it is good, some are not.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ya dị mma, ụfọdụ adịghị.
He does everything well.	Ọ na-eme ihe niile nke ọma.
Somehow, he told her to quit school.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ọ gwara ya ka ọ kwụsị akwụkwọ.
Most of the third season.	Ọtụtụ n'ime oge nke atọ.
Way to reach it.	Ụzọ iji ruo ya.
It will not be easy.	Ọ gaghị adị mfe.
He saw the music video last night.	Ọ hụrụ ihe nkiri egwu n'abalị ụnyaahụ.
They know the law.	Ha maara iwu.
However, they are not the same thing.	Otú ọ dị, ha abụghị otu ihe.
The woman's bag was the color of her eyes.	Akpa nwanyị ahụ bụ agba anya ya.
Of course they did.	N'ezie, ha mere.
And we are clear.	Na anyị doro anya.
Of course it is my fault.	N'ezie ọ bụ m kpatara.
He plays football at school.	Ọ na-agba bọọlụ n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
We did well with it.	Anyị mere nke ọma na ya.
In the big picture, no really.	Na nnukwu foto, ọ dịghị n'ezie.
The child was impressed.	Mmasị ahụ masịrị nwa ahụ.
The team was having a great time.	Ndị otu ahụ nọ na-enwe oge dị egwu.
Second, the case.	Nke abụọ, ikpe.
You are the one who needs it.	Ọ bụ gị bụ onye chọrọ ya.
I knew it was going to be a little bit.	Ama m na ọ ga-adị ntakịrị.
A problem that has existed since ancient times.	Nsogbu nke dị kemgbe oge ochie.
In those small hands.	Na obere aka ndị ahụ.
Being human.	Ịbụ mmadụ.
No one wants it.	Ọ dịghị onye chọrọ ya.
He hurried away.	O were ọsọ pụọ.
In a moment, he was ready.	Obere oge, ọ dị njikere.
Unemployment, they said.	Enweghị ọrụ, ha kwuru.
And that was really hard for me.	Na nke ahụ siri m ike n'ezie.
Because you know we got money.	N'ihi na ị maara na o doro anya na anyị nwetara ego.
We have so much to do.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ ihe anyị ga-eme.
Let me tell you it doesn’t work.	Ka m gwa gị na ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
Hardly anyone thinks such a day will come.	O siri ike onye ọ bụla chere na ụbọchị dị otú ahụ ga-abịa.
Tonight he will make his journey.	N'abalị a ọ ga-eme njem ya.
That’s the joke about the phone.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọchị gbasara ekwentị.
It seems they don't see it.	Ọ dị ka ha anaghị ahụ ya.
He was having trouble finding work.	Ọ nọ na-enwe nsogbu ịchọta ọrụ.
I don't have a bag.	Enweghị akpa m.
You can't do everything right away.	Ị nweghị ike ime ihe niile ozugbo.
No work required.	Enweghị ọrụ ọ bụla achọrọ.
Most days it feels good and good.	Ọtụtụ ụbọchị ọ na-enwe mmetụta dị mma na nke ọma.
If it works, it works.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ na-arụ ọrụ, ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
The talk ended there.	Okwu ahụ kwụsịrị n'ebe ahụ.
This is his second book.	Nke a bụ akwụkwọ nke abụọ ya.
We can't go anywhere today.	Anyị enweghị ike ịga ebe ọ bụla taa.
I want that kind of life.	Achọrọ m ụdị ndụ ahụ.
This is a quarter of the water.	Nke a bụ otu ụzọ n'ụzọ anọ nke mmiri.
Every child can talk.	Nwa ọ bụla nwere ike ikwu okwu.
I like it.	Ọ masịrị m.
He went fast to do what I wanted.	Ọ gara ngwa ngwa ime ihe m chọrọ.
Others like a little bit at a time.	Ndị ọzọ na-amasị ntakịrị n'otu oge.
Do you like this idea?	Echiche a ọ masịrị gị?
Or maybe that’s his favorite.	Ma ọ bụ ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ bụ mmasị ya.
But then we had a baby.	Ma mgbe ahụ, anyị nwere nwa.
What they do during their vacations.	Ihe ha na-eme n'oge ezumike ha.
I'm not sure if it will.	Ejighị m n'aka ma ọ ga-eme.
His eyes and ears were everywhere, we were told.	Anya ya na ntị ya nọ ebe niile, a gwara anyị.
They both have great emotional impact.	Ha abụọ nwere oke mmetụta mmetụta.
It makes me so much.	Ọ na-eme m nke ukwuu.
We run tests.	Anyị na-agba ọsọ ule.
Should be fun.	Kwesịrị ịdị ụtọ.
Let's go there.	Ka anyị gaa ebe ahụ.
He wants to talk to you.	Ọ chọrọ ịgwa gị okwu.
They want to do something.	Ha chọrọ ime ihe.
How does this work?	Kedu ka nke a si arụ ọrụ?
That is the effect of all that.	Nke ahụ bụ mmetụta nke ihe niile ahụ.
He doesn't like it, he says.	Ọ naghị amasị ya, ọ na-ekwu.
That’s really pretty solid.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ezie mara mma siri ike.
I am doing well in this.	A na m eme nke ọma na nke a.
Lots of balls.	Ọtụtụ bọọlụ.
No need for anything low thank you very much.	Achọghị ihe ọ bụla dị ala daalụ nke ukwuu.
I can’t tell you how it happened.	Enweghị m ike ịgwa gị ka o si mee.
Good news for the day.	Ozi ọma maka ụbọchị ahụ.
They have housework.	Ha nwere ọrụ ụlọ.
The law has no power over him.	Iwu enweghị ike n'ebe ọ nọ.
There are no reports.	Enweghị akụkọ ọ bụla.
He said that he did not care what people thought.	O kwuru na ya achọghị ịma ihe ndị mmadụ na-eche.
Very small.	Obere obere.
They have no weapons.	Ha enweghị ngwa ọgụ.
You have years and years.	Ị nwere afọ na afọ.
You come by my side for dinner.	Ị na-abịa n'akụkụ m maka nri abalị.
But it is not an easy task.	Ma ọ bụghị ọrụ dị mfe.
He doesn’t run on alcohol.	Ọ naghị agba ọsọ na mmanya.
You can tell it.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa ya.
Much more than he can offer now.	Nke ukwuu karịa ka o nwere ike inye ugbu a.
Not that he can do a lot of things.	Ọ bụghị na o nwere ike ime ọtụtụ ihe.
And this year is no different.	Na nke afọ a adịghị iche.
If not the door, the window area.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị ọnụ ụzọ, windo ebe.
You can stay in the same boat.	Ị nwere ike ịnọ n'otu ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
It is not possible.	Enweghị ike.
Just like that.	Dị nnọọ otú ahụ na.
But now it makes me feel good.	Ma ugbu a, o mere ka obi dị m mma.
A lot can happen during this time.	Ọtụtụ ihe nwere ike ime n'oge a.
I think that is useful.	Echere m na nke ahụ bara uru.
I wouldn’t expect so many problems here.	Agaghị m atụ anya ọtụtụ nsogbu ebe a.
Make it stop.	Mee ka ọ kwụsị.
They refused to help us.	Ha jụrụ inye aka anyị.
Otherwise, it will be.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ ga-abụ.
It will be a major national story.	Ga-abụ isi akụkọ mba.
Then he liked it a little.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ masịrị ya ntakịrị.
Give one of them.	Nye otu n'ime ha.
It was because one of the team was not doing well.	Ọ bụ n'ihi na otu n'ime otu egwuregwu ahụ emeghị nke ọma.
Unfortunately, few people understand.	Ọ bụ ihe nwute na mmadụ ole na ole ghọtara.
Its temperature is too high.	Okpomọkụ ya dị oke elu.
This, however, by the way.	Nke a, Otú ọ dị, n'ụzọ.
Nice to be there.	Ọ dị mma ịnọ ebe ahụ.
Other examples are a little more complex.	Ihe atụ ndị ọzọ dị ntakịrị karịa.
It’s different for the girls.	Ọ dị iche na ụmụ agbọghọ ahụ.
He will cook for an hour.	Ọ ga-esi nri otu awa.
Many times now, though.	Ọtụtụ mgbe ugbu a, n'agbanyeghị.
Just know them.	Naanị mara ha.
My life, my heart.	Ndụ m, obi m.
Kind of work.	Ụdị ọrụ.
The weather is different from what they expected.	Ihu igwe dị iche n'ihe ha tụrụ anya ya.
The crew was young.	Ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ bụ nwata.
You will want that now.	Ị ga-achọ nke ahụ ugbu a.
In the past, he thought he was a human.	N'oge ochie, ọ na-eche na ya bụ mmadụ.
I think it's a good thing.	Echere m na ọ bụ ezigbo ihe.
He played well today.	Ọ gbara bọọlụ nke ọma taa.
I have what we want.	Enwere m ihe anyị chọrọ.
He enjoys singing at home.	Ọ na-atọ ya ụtọ ịbụ abụ n'ụlọ.
By the way, no.	N'agbanyeghị, ọ dịghị.
Everyone has the same problem.	Onye ọ bụla nwere otu nsogbu.
We are very happy.	Obi dị anyị ụtọ nke ukwuu.
They just do not know.	Ha amaghị nnọọ.
This is not good.	Nke a adịghị mma.
I do not know, myself.	Amaghị m, mụ onwe m.
This is a lot.	Nke a bụ ọtụtụ.
I have no idea how to do each one.	Enweghị m echiche otu esi eme nke ọ bụla.
This is confident.	Nke a nwere obi ike.
Very good.	Ọ dị ezigbo mma.
It may take longer than you expect.	O nwere ike were ya ogologo oge karịa ka ị tụrụ anya ya.
Not to mention the many other women.	Ọ bụghị ikwu banyere ọtụtụ ụmụ nwanyị ndị ọzọ.
We are one.	Anyị bụ otu.

You asked my opinion.	Ị jụrụ uche m.
Not many tried.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ndị gbalịrị.
It will be expensive.	Ọ ga-adị ọnụ.
I was afraid to say anything about what happened.	Ụjọ tụrụ m ikwu ihe ọ bụla gbasara ihe merenụ.
The plaintiffs have no more to say about them individually.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ndị gbara akwụkwọ na-ekwu banyere ha n'otu n'otu.
You can see that as follows.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ nke ahụ dị ka ndị a.
That makes you work.	Nke ahụ na-eme gị ọrụ.
He loved being in this team.	Ọ hụrụ n'anya nke ukwuu ịnọ na otu a.

It was a good day to be indoors.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ụbọchị ịnọ n'ime ụlọ.

I want them to do it.	Achọrọ m ka ha mee ya.
By the way, this will be in the newspaper.	Site n'ụzọ, nke a ga-abụ na akwụkwọ akụkọ.
He came ready.	Ọ bịara na njikere.
Everything is beautiful so far.	Ihe niile mara mma ruo ugbu a.
Power is very important for this.	Ike dị oke mkpa maka nke a.
A journalist can talk to her.	Otu onye nta akụkọ nwere ike ịgwa ya okwu.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị obere karịa ka a jụrụ ya.
There is no similar.	Ọ dịghị onye yiri.
I told him about my day.	Agwara m ya banyere ụbọchị m.
But every day is a little easier.	Mana ụbọchị ọ bụla dị ntakịrị mfe.
Not everywhere but it is there.	Ọ bụghị ebe niile mana ọ dị ebe ahụ.

I can't find it at home, either.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ya n'ụlọ, ma.
Can you think of me how to get there.	Ị nwere ike iche banyere m otú ị ga-esi.
There are so many ideas out there.	Enwere ọtụtụ echiche dị n'ebe ahụ.
There is no value in life.	Ọ dịghị uru na ndụ.
They will both go.	Ha abụọ ga-aga.
Unemployment, no responsibility.	Enweghị ọrụ, enweghị ibu ọrụ.
He wants to get out, now.	Ọ chọrọ ịpụ, ugbu a.
I have no doubts.	Anaghị m enwe obi abụọ.
You do not.	Ị naghị eme.
This is drinking alcohol.	Nke a na-aṅụ mmanya.
We are almost like grandchildren.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka anyị dị ka ụmụ ụmụ.
It is better than having it in years.	Ọ dị mma karịa ka o nwere n'ime afọ.
These items are for temporary use only.	Ihe ndị a bụ maka iji naanị obere oge.
You can not do anything.	Ị nweghị ike ime ihe ọ bụla.
That is the rule of the game.	Nke ahụ bụ iwu egwuregwu.
At the door he stopped.	N'ọnụ ụzọ ọ kwụsịrị.
You for that.	Gị maka nke ahụ.
It reads like a book.	Ọ na-agụ dị ka akwụkwọ.
The reason is unknown.	Amaghị ihe kpatara ya.
You have to plan your age.	Ị ga-eme atụmatụ afọ gị.
But only a few days.	Mana ọ bụ naanị ụbọchị ole na ole.
His life is an event.	Ndụ ya bụ ihe omume.
Where the disease is still known to exist.	Ebe ọrịa a ka mara na ọ dị.

That is unparalleled beauty.	Nke ahụ mara mma na-enweghị atụ.
I can say that.	Enwere m ike ikwu nke ahụ.
Everyone has a story.	Onye ọ bụla nwere akụkọ.
They should be here.	Ha kwesịrị ịnọ ebe a.
He was scared a second time.	Ọ tụrụ egwu nke ugboro abụọ.
What a surprise, he was.	Gịnị ike, o juru ya anya.
Words are really powerful.	Okwu dị ike n'ezie.
You feel great at a party and a game.	Ị na-enwe mmetụta na oriri na ọṅụṅụ na egwuregwu.
That was the fight that scared me.	Nke ahụ bụ ọgụ ahụ tụrụ m ụjọ.
This would be very foolish.	Nke a ga-abụ nnọọ nzuzu.
It is you.	Ị bụ gị.
You are not allowed to do that.	A naghị ekwe ka ị mee nke ahụ.
Make it good.	Mee ka ọ dị mma.
There is nothing more beautiful than a living tree.	Ọ dịghị ihe mara mma karịa osisi ndụ ndụ.
The difference, however, is real.	Otú ọ dị, ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu.
I really am.	Abụ m n'ezie.
I can think of one way.	Enwere m ike iche otu ụzọ.
It will not work.	Ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ.
He doesn’t really run.	Ọ naghị agba ọsọ n'ezie.
I have nothing else to do, of course.	Enweghị m ihe ọzọ m ga-eme, n'ezie.
The workers received high wages.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ nwetara ụgwọ ọrụ dị elu.
The girls left with tears in their eyes.	Ụmụ agbọghọ ahụ ji anya mmiri pụọ.
The price of this restaurant is reasonable.	Ọnụ ahịa ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ a nwere ezi uche.
Looking forward to seeing you again.	Na-atụ anya ịhụ ya ọzọ.
Clearly so.	O doro anya na nke ahụ.
I wonder how old he is, really.	M na-eche afọ ole ọ dị, n'ezie.
We know if it works or not.	Anyị maara ma ọ na-arụ ọrụ ma ọ bụ na ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
Mice run around their legs.	Oke na-agba gburugburu ụkwụ ha.
This is what happens.	Nke a bụ ihe na-eme.
We are alone in the room.	Naanị anyị nọ n'ime ụlọ.
You can go on and on.	Ị nwere ike ịga n'ihu na-aga n'ihu.

So, they do it.	Ya mere, ha na-eme ya.
He can do it himself.	O nwere ike ime onwe ya.
There is a door.	Enwere otu ọnụ ụzọ.
I hope this is better.	Enwere m olileanya na nke a ka mma.
But wait, they say something else.	Ma chere, e nwere ihe ọzọ ka ha na-ekwu.
I need that kind of machine.	Achọrọ m ụdị igwe ahụ.
They can do what they want.	Ha nwere ike ime ihe ha chọrọ.
Stupid, stupid little fool.	Ndị nzuzu, ndị nzuzu obere nzuzu.
People here say that life cannot be hard.	Ndị mmadụ ebe a na-ekwu na ndụ enweghị ike siri ike.
They come here.	Ha na-abịa ebe a.
There are different types of travel.	Ụdị njem dị iche iche dị.

He knew I knew what was inside of me.	Ọ maara m na ihe dị n'ime m maara ya.
That does not happen often.	Nke ahụ anaghị eme ọtụtụ mgbe.
Until last week it was working fine.	Ruo izu gara aga ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
We do not have many toys.	Anyị enweghị ọtụtụ ihe egwuregwu ụmụaka.
Everything seems so bad.	Ihe niile dị ka ihe dị njọ.
Which is what these two people are.	Kedu nke bụ ihe mmadụ abụọ a bụ.
So, to another company, everywhere during the day.	Ya mere, ka ụlọ ọrụ ọzọ, ebe niile n'ehihie.
The user says they did "buy emotions."	Onye ọrụ ahụ na-ekwu na ha mere "zụta mmetụta uche."
But not many of them understood.	Ma ọ bụghị ọtụtụ n'ime ha ghọtara.
But that thought did not make him happy now.	Ma echiche ahụ emeghị ka obi dị ya ụtọ ugbu a.
He will take action.	Ọ ga-eme ihe.
Many people enjoy the countryside.	Ime obodo na-atọ ọtụtụ ndị ụtọ.
If you read anything more than anything else, you are doing wrong.	Ọ bụrụ na ị na-agụ ihe ọ bụla karịa ihe ọzọ, ị na-eme ihe ọjọọ.
It was a great feeling.	Ọ bụ nnukwu mmetụta.
This money will only be used for this.	A ga-eji ego a naanị maka nke a.
This is the message.	Nke a bụ ozi.
This is great.	Nke a bụ akwa.
It is always his name.	Ọ bụ aha ya mgbe niile.

Definitely a bit of it, of course.	N'ezie ntakịrị nke ya, n'ezie.
I doubt they are.	Enwere m obi abụọ ma ha nọ na ya.
It is the first other spirit.	Ọ bụ mmụọ mbụ ọzọ.
But that's his name.	Ma nke ahụ bụ aha ya.
I’m pretty sure this is stupid on his part.	O doro m anya na nke a bụ nzuzu n'akụkụ ya.
He said he knew.	O kwuru na ya maara.
We know that the day will come.	Anyị ma na ụbọchị a ga-abịa.
Not that you think.	Ọ bụghị na ị na-eche.
It does not taste good, if you will.	Ọ naghị atọ ụtọ anụ ahụ, ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ.
They make me smile, every time.	Ha na-eme m ọnụ ọchị, oge ọ bụla.
In time, however, no one heard anything else.	Otú ọ dị, ka oge na-aga, ọ dịghị onye nụrụ ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
Only myself.	Naanị onwe m.
These things happen.	Ihe ndị a na-eme.
The law still applies today.	Iwu ahụ ka dị taa.
I know there is more to our story.	Amaara m na e nwere ihe ọzọ na akụkọ anyị.

But this time we are ready.	Ma na nke ugbu a anyị dị njikere.
Hope you can help.	Olileanya na ị nwere ike inye aka.
But while you are here, you will not go home.	Mana ị nọ ebe a, ị gaghị ala ụlọ.
Of places car many a company.	Nke ebe ụgbọ ala ọtụtụ a ụlọ ọrụ.
He was completely surprised.	O juru ya anya ma ọlị.
You should make it as easy as possible wherever possible.	Ị kwesịrị ime ka ọ dị mfe ebe ọ bụla enwere ike.
The trip took two days.	Njem ahụ were ụbọchị abụọ.
My right door looks very good.	Ọnụ ụzọ aka nri m yiri nke ọma.
This did not happen.	Nke a emeghị.
And inside, there is.	Na n'ime, e nwere .
Maybe that's what he wants.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ihe ọ chọrọ.
Other cities know it.	Obodo ndị ọzọ mara ya.
Cook the meat as you like.	Esi nri anụ ahụ ka ọ masịrị.
It really does.	Ọ na-eme n'ezie.
We should call it yesterday.	Anyị kwesịrị ịkpọ ya ụnyahụ.
Where they are now, he wonders.	Ebee ka ha nọ ugbu a, ọ na-eche.
They are far from the capital.	Ha dị anya site n'isi obodo ahụ.
At the third door, he stopped.	N'ọnụ ụzọ nke atọ, ọ kwụsịrị.
So far, most people are aware of the weather.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, ihe ka ọtụtụ ná ndị mmadụ maara ihe dị na ihu igwe.
It may be small.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe dị obere.
Now we do everything together.	Ugbu a, anyị na-eme ihe niile ọnụ.
And this is the same thing.	Na nke a bụ otu ihe ahụ.
Each house is yours to make it look like yours.	Ụlọ ọ bụla bụ nke gị iji mee ka ọ dị ka nke gị.
This is the day I left the baby.	Nke a bụ otu ụbọchị m hapụrụ nwa ọhụrụ ahụ.
That said, what makes me happy is the fact.	Nke ahụ kwuru, ihe na-eme m obi ụtọ bụ ihe.
I want beautiful eyes.	Achọrọ m anya mara mma.
Things are going well.	Ihe na-aga nke ọma.
Last year.	Afọ gara aga.
He really wanted that.	Ọ chọrọ nke ahụ nke ukwuu.
There is only one reason for this.	Enwere naanị otu ihe kpatara nke a.
I like to eat it in pairs.	Ọ na-amasị m iri ya ụzọ abụọ.
But there you know what they did.	Ma n’ebe ahụ, ị ​​ma ihe ha mere.

But it is good that it will be so.	Ma ọ dị mma na ọ ga-adị otú ahụ.
You will want them.	Ị ga-achọ ha.
The same is true now.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị ugbu a.
We read travel books.	Anyị na-agụ akwụkwọ njem.
That should be the case.	Nke ahụ kwesịrị ịbụ nke ahụ.

Now it is good.	Ugbu a dị mma.
That is it now.	Nke ahụ bụ ya ugbu a.
I enjoy doing things.	Ime ihe na-atọ m ụtọ.
We viewed it as a newspaper.	Anyị lere ya anya dị ka akwụkwọ akụkọ.
This is unique.	Nke a pụrụ iche.
Think of a person as a child, when he or she is.	Na-eche na mmadụ bụ nwata, mgbe ọ bụ ma .
And the plan is good.	Na atụmatụ ahụ dị mma.
Same thing in the afternoon.	Otu ihe ahụ n'oge ehihie.

The family will move forward.	Ezinụlọ ga-aga n'ihu.
She seems to be enjoying it.	O yiri ka ọ̀ na-eme ya obi ụtọ.
A “great crowd” is expected to come.	A na-atụ anya na “nnukwu mmadụ” ga-abịa.
I want to go there, he said.	Achọrọ m ịga ebe ahụ, o kwuru.
Boys to girls, girls and boys.	Ụmụ nwoke ruo ụmụ agbọghọ, ụmụ agbọghọ na ụmụ nwoke.
The fire lasted for several hours.	Ọkụ ahụ gbara ọtụtụ awa.
People here will be here.	Ndị nọ ebe a ga-anọ ebe a.
I don’t want to see him do that.	Achọghị m ịhụ ka ọ na-eme nke ahụ.
She wanted her father to be alone.	Ọ chọrọ ka nna ya nọrọ onwe ya.
But you know me.	Ma, ị maara m.
They never have.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha nwere.
You are the judge of that.	Ị bụ onye ikpe nke ahụ.

He received a letter from a friend.	O nwetara akwụkwọ ozi site n'aka otu enyi ya.
We left a comment.	Anyị hapụrụ ikwu.

From our vantage point, we can not see why.	Site n'ebe anyị nọ, anyị enweghị ike ịhụ ihe kpatara ya.

You are there.	Ị nọ ebe ahụ.
But that's what this is all about.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe nke a gbasara.

My husband says that my gift is not timely.	Di m kwuru na onyinye m anaghị eme n'oge.

Fast delivery is not recommended.	A naghị atụ aro ngwa ugboro ugboro.

The man was a teacher.	Nwoke ahụ bụ onye nkuzi.
This is not the current situation.	Nke a abụghị ọnọdụ nke dị ugbu a.
They are like dogs.	Ha dị ka nkịta.
Then the room cooled.	Mgbe ahụ, ọnụ ụlọ ahụ jụrụ oyi.

Now the police are saying the same thing.	Ugbu a ndị uwe ojii na-ekwu otu ihe ahụ.

There is a book about that.	Enwere akwụkwọ gbasara nke ahụ.
He was imprisoned severely.	A tụrụ ya mkpọrọ siri ike.

The doctor looked at him carefully.	Dọkịta ahụ lere ya anya nke ọma.

He saw a purse full of money.	Ọ hụrụ otu akpa ego juru.

Of course you have a gift for language.	N'ezie ị nwere onyinye maka asụsụ.

The good news is that you do not want it.	Ozi ọma ahụ bụ na ị chọghị ya.
The policeman ordered the man to stop.	Onye uwe ojii ahụ nyere nwoke ahụ iwu ka ọ kwụsị.
But that is not a good thing to do these days.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị ihe mara mma ime ụbọchị ndị a.
Sometimes these are our friends.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ndị a bụ ndị enyi anyị.
He would have liked it that way.	Ọ gaara amasị ya otú ahụ.

I really think this is going to be huge.	Echere m n'ezie na nke a ga-abụ nnukwu.

This girl is scared.	Nwa agbọghọ a na-atụ egwu.
He doesn’t like you, of course, but.	Ọ nweghị mmasị na gị, n'ezie, mana .
He did it himself, when he was a child.	O mere ya n'onwe ya, mgbe ọ bụ nwata.
I can't do anything about it.	Enweghị m ike ime ihe ọ bụla gbasara ya.
He is not like others.	Ọ dịghị ka ndị ọzọ.
This should not be a big deal.	Nke a ekwesịghị ịbụ nnukwu ihe.
All he needed to do was win the game.	Naanị ihe ọ chọrọ ka ọ nweta egwuregwu ahụ.
It just isn’t that easy.	Naanị ọ bụghị otú ahụ dị mfe.
I can see it now.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ya ugbu a.
The drive took more than an hour.	Ụgbọala ahụ karịrị otu awa.
He is not violent.	Ọ naghị eme ihe ike.
His wife refused to have him inside.	Nwunye ya jụrụ inwe ya n'ime.
She is beautiful to the people.	Ọ mara mma n'anya ndị ahụ.
As a customer.	Dị ka onye ahịa.
Not what they did before.	Ọ bụghị ihe ha mere na mbụ.
But it is foolish and evil.	Ma ọ bụ nzuzu na ihe ọjọọ.

He got bad.	Ọ nwetara ihe ọjọọ.
Until last month.	Ruo ọnwa gara aga.
And make sure it looks good.	Ma hụ na ọ dị ka ọ dị mma.
It doesn't look like food.	Ọ naghị adị ka nri.
There may be another.	Enwere ike inwe nke ọzọ.
It should be too large.	Ọ kwesịrị ịdị oke oke.
The trip to the village took longer than he expected.	Njem ahụ n'ime obodo were oge karịa ka ọ tụrụ anya ya.
For something as simple as this.	Maka ihe dị mfe dị ka nke a.
We only got one small car.	Anyị nwetara naanị otu obere ụgbọ ala a.

This is a colorless liquid.	Nke a bụ mmiri mmiri na-enweghị agba.

I can gain weight during difficult times.	Enwere m ike ibu ibu mgbe oge siri ike.
That’s not all words here.	Nke ahụ abụghị okwu niile ebe a.
I can't believe it, but he was right.	Apụghị m ikweta, mana o kwuru eziokwu.
Or someone who spoke to him, for that matter.	Ma ọ bụ onye gwara ya okwu, maka nke ahụ.
The tower was seen in the distance.	A hụrụ ụlọ elu n'ebe dị anya.
But sometimes accidents happen.	Ma mgbe ụfọdụ ihe mberede na-eme.
They have two children.	Ha nwere ụmụ abụọ.
But you seem to know that.	Mana ọ dị ka ị maara nke ahụ.
He does a great job and he runs.	Ọ na-arụ nnukwu ọrụ na ọ na-agba ọsọ.
We do not want that to happen to us.	Anyị achọghị ka ụdị ihe ahụ mee anyị.
Then he went and did it again.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ gara mee ya ọzọ.
It's too sweet.	Ọ dị ụtọ nke ukwuu.
One meal, please.	Otu nri, biko.
This is my boat.	Nke a bụ ụgbọ mmiri m.

Men are different.	Ụmụ nwoke dị iche.
No one knows whether the stories are true or not.	Ọ dịghị onye maara ma akụkọ ndị ahụ bụ eziokwu ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị.
There can be no.	Enweghị ike ịdị.
It's nice that little people are going to dance.	Ọ dị mma na obere mmadụ na-aga ịgba egwu ahụ.

They did better.	Ha mere ihe ka mma.
We are scared.	Anyị na-atụ ụjọ.

You may be wondering why this is happening.	Ị nwere ike ịnọ na-eche ihe kpatara nke a.

But it is not close.	Ma ọ dịghị nso.
It is only a few weeks.	Ọ bụ naanị izu ole na ole.
Not that you want to.	Ọ bụghị na ị chọrọ.
Of course, we do not know when that began.	N'ezie, anyị enweghị ike ịma mgbe ọ malitere.
We will continue to work.	Anyị ga-aga n'ihu na-arụ ọrụ.
That's the real thing.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe n'ezie.

Fresh vegetables, but cook it fast.	Akwụkwọ nri ọhụrụ, mana esi ya ngwa ngwa.
It's beautiful, sweet, real.	Ọ mara mma, ụtọ, ezigbo.

His name is incomparable.	Aha ya enweghị atụ.

Help came quickly.	Enyemaka bịara ngwa ngwa.
Which ones, it’s hard to say.	Kedu ndị, ọ siri ike ikwu.
What can be said about this song?	Kedu ihe enwere ike ikwu maka egwu a?
Power and fear.	Ike na egwu.
It is the ocean.	Ọ bụ oke osimiri.
I’m glad the songs make sense.	Obi dị m ụtọ na egwu ndị ahụ nwere ezi uche.
He checked his phone.	Ọ lere ekwentị ya.
You two are here.	Unu abụọ nọrọ ebe a.

Not that he expected anything.	Ọ bụghị na ọ tụrụ anya ihe ọ bụla.

Newspapers are not a good job.	Akwụkwọ akụkọ abụghị ezigbo ọrụ.
It's too far.	Ọ dị oke anya.
The minister spent much of his time abroad.	Onye ozi ahụ nọrọ ọtụtụ oge ya ná mba ọzọ.
But he is not alone.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị ya.
That is a tragedy.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe egwu.
What was the first city to make a movie?	Gịnị bụ obodo mbụ mere ihe nkiri?
They are like him.	Ha dị ka ya.
He spoke to them happily.	O ji obi ụtọ gwa ha okwu.
It is pregnancy.	Ọ bụ ime.
But he didn't tell any friends at the time.	Ma ọ̀ gwara ndị enyi ọ bụla n’oge ahụ.
I am not one of them.	Abụghị m otu n'ime ha.
He made fun of her.	O mere ya ihe ọchị.
I do not think so.	Echeghị m otú ahụ.
All passengers felt nervous.	Ndị njem niile nwere mmetụta nke ụjọ.
You know how that is.	Ị maara otú nke ahụ dị.
I want you to get a lot and help a lot of people.	Achọrọ m ị nweta ọtụtụ ma nyere ọtụtụ mmadụ aka.
Winter is coming, action should be taken immediately.	Oge oyi na-abịa, ekwesịrị ime ihe ozugbo.
We can't see any life here.	Anyị enweghị ike ịhụ ndụ ọ bụla ebe a.
He told her that they were close.	Ọ gwara ya na ha nọ nso.
I never looked at it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m lere ya anya.
We are happy to do it for these cute dogs.	Obi dị anyị ụtọ ime ya maka nkịta ndị a mara mma.
Everyone else seems to be doing the same thing well.	Onye ọ bụla ọzọ yiri ka ọ na-eme nke ọma otu ihe ahụ.
The food was good on both flights.	Nri ahụ dị mma na ụgbọ elu abụọ ahụ.
He is looking for a wife.	Ọ na-achọ nwunye.
He ate breakfast fast.	O riri nri ụtụtụ ngwa ngwa.
We are afraid of him.	Anyị na-atụ ya egwu.
At one point, he found someone like him.	N’otu oge, ọ hụrụ onye yiri ya.
This building has historical significance.	Ụlọ a nwere mkpa akụkọ ihe mere eme.
It is different today.	Ọ dị iche n'oge a.
He obviously did not know me.	O doro anya na ọ maghị m.
Thanks for all your help !.	Daalụ maka enyemaka gị niile!.
His friends continued.	Ndị enyi ya gara n'ihu.
Let's not play games.	Ka anyị ghara igwu egwuregwu.
He seems to have a good command.	Ọ dị ka ọ nwere ezigbo iwu.
Each is a gift.	Nke ọ bụla bụ onyinye.
All we can know is that the story will continue.	Naanị ihe anyị nwere ike ịma bụ na akụkọ ahụ ga-aga n'ihu.
Now you speak the name.	Ugbu a ị na-ekwu aha.
Life is a game for those who seek it.	Ndụ bụ egwuregwu maka ndị na-achọ ya.
That has no value in reality or anything.	Nke ahụ enweghị uru na eziokwu ma ọ bụ n'ihe ọ bụla.
He never mentioned his mother.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ kpọrọ nne ya aha.
In the newspaper.	Na akwụkwọ akụkọ.
But then that’s the point.	Ma, mgbe ahụ, nke ahụ bụ isi ihe.
He was a good family man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwoke ezinụlọ.
The name of the city began to fade quickly.	Aha obodo ahụ malitere ịla ngwa ngwa.
The reason.	Ihe kpatara ya.
The city plan is almost the same.	Atụmatụ obodo ahụ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ otu.
This is its third airport.	Nke a bụ ọdụ ụgbọ elu nke atọ ya.
But beautiful.	Ma mara mma.
I want you to go out and get one.	Achọrọ m ka ị pụọ nweta otu.
There are many types of insects.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụdị ahụhụ dị iche iche.
The food arrived quickly.	Nri ahụ rutere ngwa ngwa.
The letter came while he was at work.	Akwụkwọ ozi ahụ bịara mgbe ọ nọ n'ọrụ.
I need it.	Ọ dị m mkpa.
It is not the best thing to do in real life.	Ọ bụghị ihe kacha mma ime na ndụ n'ezie.
Still, we all know that you never knew.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, anyị niile maara na ọ dịghị mgbe ị maghị.
I'm still in it.	M ka nọ na ya.
I think not.	Echere m na ọ bụghị.
Everything is so beautiful, perfect.	Ihe niile mara mma nke ukwuu, zuru oke.
Of course, we never talked about this.	N'ezie, ọ dịghị mgbe anyị kwuru banyere nke a.
I could not do it if it was not.	Enweghị m ike ime ya ma ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị.
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, ha emeghị.
In about a month.	N'ihe dị ka otu ọnwa.
This is stupid.	Nke a bụ ihe nzuzu.
It's not just me.	Ọ bụghị naanị na ọ bụ m kpatara.
However, the weather was unpredictable.	Otú ọ dị, ihu igwe enweghị atụ.
I want to see it, right away.	Achọrọ m ịhụ ya, ozugbo.
But there is more on the horizon.	Ma e nwere ihe ọzọ ga-abịa.
I think he needs some help.	Echere m na ọ chọrọ enyemaka ụfọdụ.
He saw a few travelers.	Ọ hụrụ ndị njem ole na ole.

Let's come differently.	Ka anyị bịa n'ụzọ dị iche.
The song is beautiful.	Abụ ahụ mara mma.
Act wisely.	Mee ihe nwere uche.
This is what he expects.	Nke a bụ ihe ọ tụrụ anya ya.
Let’s make things easier this year.	Ka anyị mee ka ihe dị mfe n'afọ a.
It could be the other way around.	O nwere ike ịbụ n'ụzọ ọzọ.
This is indeed a real place.	N'ezie nke a bụ ebe dị adị.
Their names say it all.	Aha ha kwuru ya niile.
Which is nice.	Nke dị mma.
He does not do that here, however.	Ọ naghị eme nke ahụ ebe a, Otú ọ dị.
I stopped the song.	M kwụsịrị egwu ahụ.
You can.	Ị nwere ike.
There may still be a way.	A ka nwere ike inwe ụzọ.
It was 'me' doing it.	Ọ bụ 'm' na-eme ya.
Just what he wanted.	Naanị ihe ọ chọrọ.
Woman, you are the gates of hell.	Nwanyị, ị bụ ọnụ ụzọ ala mmụọ.
His wife was in front of him.	Nwunye ya nọ n'ihu ya.
We got it right.	Anyị nwetara ya nke ọma.
There are some reasons.	E nwere ụfọdụ ndị mere.
He knows that.	Ọ maara nke ahụ.
He was very upset about the situation.	Ọnọdụ ahụ adịghị ya mma nke ukwuu.
Cold is not what he expected.	Oyi adịghị ka ọ tụrụ anya ya.
I'm not laughing.	Adịghị m ọchị.
They found that many nearby cities were inhabited.	Ha hụrụ na ọtụtụ obodo ndị dị nso bi.
I like all kinds of food.	Enwere m mmasị na ụdị nri niile.
She had a baby with him.	Ya na ya mụrụ nwa.
She is not a wife.	Ọ bụghị nwunye.
A family of four.	Ezinụlọ nke mmadụ anọ.
They are all there.	Ha niile nọ ebe ahụ.
People need money fast for the right kind of reason.	Ndị mmadụ chọrọ ego ngwa ngwa maka ụdị ezi ihe kpatara ya.
So we thought.	Ya mere, anyị chere.
I do both.	M na-eme ihe abụọ ahụ.
Not today.	Ọ bụghị taa.
The coach said the athletes' health was improving.	Onye nkuzi ahụ kwuru na ahụ ike ndị egwuregwu na-aga nke ọma.
No one knows where he is.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ebe ọ nọ.
It may be his opinion.	O nwere ike ịbụ echiche ya.
No one else did.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ mere.
He wanted to call, but something stopped him.	Ọ chọrọ ịkpọ, ma o nwere ihe kwụsịrị ya.
I'm not really.	Abụghị m n'ezie.
It will go its own way.	Ọ ga-aga nke ya.
It's big and cheap.	Ọ bụ nnukwu na ọnụ ala.
At my house.	N'ụlọ m.
He put himself in it.	O tinyere onwe ya na ya.
Go fast.	Gaa ngwa ngwa.
Or your brother, for that.	Ma ọ bụ nwanne gị, maka nke ahụ.
I don’t eat that, no.	Anaghị m eri ihe ahụ, mba.
You can not get another job.	Ị nweghị ike nweta ọrụ ọzọ.
He hurried to the door.	Ọ gara ngwa ngwa gaa n'ọnụ ụzọ.
It has no effect.	Ọ naghị enwe mmetụta.
There are two main types.	E nwere ụdị isi abụọ.
He could not go to summer school.	Ọ nweghị ike ịga ụlọ akwụkwọ okpomọkụ.
Of course there may be others.	N'ezie enwere ike inwe ndị ọzọ.
I like his idea.	Echiche ya na-amasị m.
But all is well, all is well.	Ma ihe niile dị mma, ihe niile dị mma.
No one was around to help.	Ọ dịghị onye nọ nso inyere ya aka.
Maybe he was interested.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ nwere mmasị.
The opinion of the group is good.	Echiche nke otu dị mma.
I hope it is not so for you.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ bụghị otú ahụ maka gị.
But here there is a bigger problem.	Mana ebe a enwere nsogbu ka ukwuu.
Not a perfect plan.	Ọ bụghị atụmatụ zuru oke.
Then we went to the port.	Anyị wee gaa n'akụkụ ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri.
At school, he was the only one eating lunch.	N'ụlọ akwụkwọ, ọ bụ naanị ya na-eri nri ehihie.
The place is beautiful.	Ebe ahụ mara mma.
Maybe no one will.	Ma eleghị anya ọ dịghị onye ga-eme ya.
His anger is even greater.	Iwe ya ka njọ.
It can be difficult at times.	O nwere ike isi ike mgbe ụfọdụ.
He was wondering where he was tonight.	Ọ nọ na-eche ebe ọ nọ n'abalị a.
Like last time.	Dị ka oge ikpeazụ.
You feel good about wanting to help me.	Ọ dị gị mma ịchọrọ inyere m aka.
They feared for their lives.	Ha tụrụ egwu maka ndụ ha.
You need rest.	Ị chọrọ izu ike.
But a few more days came.	Ma ụbọchị ole na ole ọzọ wee bịa.
But this is very good.	Mana nke a dị ezigbo mma.
I do not know how long this will be.	Amaghị m ogologo oge nke a ga-adị.
I do not do this.	Anaghị m eme ihe a.
They may have been there.	O nwere ike ịbụ na ha nọ ebe ahụ.
In some ways.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
That is the law.	Nke ahụ bụ iwu.
Others will have different ideas.	Ndị ọzọ ga-enwe echiche ndị ọzọ.
Is it important?	Ọ dị mkpa?
That is what they do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ha na-eme.
If he is interested, he can find it.	Ọ bụrụ na o nwere mmasị, ọ pụrụ ịchọta ya.
They did just that.	Ha mere nnọọ otú ahụ.
He continues, still talking.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu, ka na-ekwu okwu.
He said there was no time to plan for the tragedy.	O kwuru na enweghị oge iji mee atụmatụ maka ihe egwu.
I'm not sure.	Ejighị m n'aka.
The people are very hungry.	Agụụ juru ndị obodo ahụ ihu.
Just a little color.	Naanị obere agba.
That makes sense.	Nke ahụ nwere ezi uche n'ezie.
The man stopped.	Nwoke ahụ kwụsịrị.
Not if you want to go back to the door.	Ọ bụghị ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ ịla azụ n'ọnụ ụzọ.
He seems to be happy.	O yiri ka obi dị ya ụtọ.
The place is too far away.	Ebe dị anya nke ukwuu.

Talking to people.	Ịgwa ndị mmadụ okwu.
But first, the angel.	Ma nke mbụ, mmụọ ozi ahụ.

You do not know what bad things will happen.	Ị maghị ihe ọjọọ nwere ike ime.

No, it's just.	Mba, ọ bụ naanị .
He’s in a terrible situation.	Ọ nọ n'ihe egwu dị egwu.

Water is essential for life.	Mmiri bụ ihe dị mkpa maka ndụ.
It will be nice and fun.	Ọ ga-adị mma ma na-atọ ụtọ.
He hated her very much.	Ọ kpọrọ ya asị nke ukwuu.

The meeting is now over.	Nzukọ ahụ dị ugbu a.
No one is here.	Ọ dịghị onye nọ ebe a.
But I did not find him.	Ma ahụghị m ya.
However, things are very different.	Otú ọ dị, ihe dị nnọọ iche.
This is around one.	Nke a bụ gburugburu otu.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
That's not fair.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma.
Everything can be.	Ihe niile nwere ike ịbụ.
Nothing more.	Ọ dịghị ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
This may take time, weeks or more.	Nke a nwere ike were oge, izu ma ọ bụ karịa.

In the summer, the fish fell.	N'oge okpomọkụ, azụ ahụ dara.

But this is not the situation we are looking for here.	Mana nke a abụghị ọnọdụ anyị na-achọ ebe a.
Law is law.	Iwu bụ iwu.
Their amazing story is similar.	Akụkọ ha na-atụ n'anya yiri nke ahụ.

That is what life is.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ndụ bụ.
The actor is very beautiful.	Onye na-eme ihe nkiri ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.

The second rule says that children must go to school.	Iwu nke abụọ kwuru na ụmụaka ga-aga akwụkwọ.
Something reached their destination.	Ihe rutere ebe ha rutere.

Of course, this time it is no different.	N'ezie, oge a ọ dịghị iche.

No one is prepared to comment on what happened.	Ọ dịghị onye dị njikere ikwu banyere ihe ahụ merenụ.

About this time his mother died.	Ọ bụ ihe dị ka n'oge a ka nne ya nwụrụ.

However, the lawsuit was filed that afternoon.	Otú ọ dị, a gbara akwụkwọ ikpe ahụ n'ehihie ahụ.

Obviously, it's better to be both.	O doro anya na ọ ka mma ịbụ ha abụọ.
Everyone was amazed.	O juru onye ọ bụla anya.
You need to tell him that.	I kwesịrị ịgwa ya nke ahụ.
His face is very close.	Ihu ya dị nso nke ukwuu.
The laughter is dead.	Ọchị ahụ nwụrụ.
He hopes the trip will be a success.	O nwere olileanya na njem ahụ ga-aga nke ọma.

Of course, these are not special.	N'ezie, ndị a abụghị ihe pụrụ iche.
Or his job, come to that.	Ma ọ bụ ọrụ ya, bịa na nke ahụ.
He loves his country.	Ọ hụrụ obodo ya n'anya.

In the event of a fire, leave the building immediately.	N'ihe gbasara ọkụ, pụọ ​​na ụlọ ahụ ozugbo.

Now he does not know why.	Ugbu a ọ gaghị ama ihe kpatara ya.

Good morning, everyone.	Ụtụtụ ọma, onye ọ bụla.

We talk two or three times a month.	Anyị na-ekwu okwu ugboro abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ n'ọnwa.
They did it again and again.	Ha mere ya ugboro ugboro.
Better than a fire of its own.	Mma karịa ọkụ nke ya.

The team works well.	Ndị otu ahụ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
I love everything you do.	Ahụrụ m ihe niile ị na-eme n'anya.

Few people fully understand them.	Ọ bụ mmadụ ole na ole ghọtara ha nke ọma.
Of course, one.	Nke ya, otu.
There are two possible explanations for this.	E nwere ihe abụọ nwere ike ime nke a.
No one else can.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ nwere ike.
He wants me.	Ọ chọrọ m.
This can be a huge force.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ nnukwu ike.
You are beautiful in these things.	Ị mara mma na ihe ndị a.
This could be a big week for him in other ways.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ nnukwu izu maka ya n'ụzọ ndị ọzọ.
But it’s about himself, of course.	Mana ọ bụ ihe gbasara onwe ya, n'ezie.
Otherwise, it is useless.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ dịghị uru.
There is no room for that here.	Enweghị ohere maka nke ahụ ebe a.
My question came to the forefront of his work with me.	Ajụjụ m rutere n'isi ọrụ ya na m.
There is always good weather here.	A na-enwe ihu igwe dị mma mgbe niile ebe a.
Now you understand that.	Ugbu a ị ghọtara nke ahụ.

So he does not know what he is doing.	Ya mere, ọ gaghị ama ihe o mere.
He immediately went there.	Ọ gara ebe ahụ ozugbo.
Fear is not one of them.	Ụjọ abụghị otu n'ime ha.
Almost no one can.	Fọrọ nke nta ka ọ dịghị onye nwere ike.
We entered a room.	Anyị banyere n'otu ọnụ ụlọ.

One man cannot do this alone.	Otu nwoke agaghị eme nke a naanị ya.

No one is more confident than you are.	O nweghị onye nwere obi ike karịa gị.

But those times were different.	Ma oge ndị ahụ dị iche.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
There was no sign of fear.	Ọ dịghị ihe yiri ka ọ na-atụ ya ụjọ.
This cannot really happen.	Nke a enweghị ike ime n'ezie.

It is no different from anything else.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị iche na ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
But he knew he knew.	Ma, ọ ma na ọ mara ya.
There are a lot of people on the beach.	Enwere ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ n'akụkụ osimiri.

There are two ways to do this.	Enwere ụzọ abụọ iji mee ya.

The man wanted each other.	Nwoke ahụ chọrọ ibe ya.

He bought me coffee.	Ọ zụtara m kọfị.
We were pretty together, but we were just kids.	Anyị mara mma ọnụ, ma anyị bụ nnọọ ụmụaka.

Such an effect is suggested in this paper.	A na-atụ aro mmetụta dị otú ahụ na akwụkwọ a.

You are my son.	Ị bụ nwa m nwoke.
Nothing really can be done.	Ọ dịghị ihe a ga-eme n'ezie.

Of course, we should call someone for this.	N'ezie, anyị kwesịrị ịkpọ mmadụ maka nke a.

Then it is different.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ dị iche.
Most of those interviewed were night workers.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị a gbara ajụjụ ọnụ bụ ndị na-arụ ọrụ abalị.
He expects little from her.	Ọ na-atụ anya obere ihe n'aka ya.

They ordered the first instruction.	Ha nyere iwu nkuzi mbụ.

You can't do what you need to do, because you are weak.	Ị gaghị eme ihe dị gị mkpa ime, n'ihi na ị na-adịghị ike.
He used to laugh when he was a kid.	Ọ na-agụ ihe ọchị mgbe ọ bụ nwata.
The work of the staff was good, but fast.	Ọrụ nke ndị ọrụ nke ọma, mana ngwa ngwa.
It works like these.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ dị ka ndị a.

But the requirements are very different.	Ma ihe a chọrọ bụ ihe dị nnọọ iche.
The community was shocked.	Ihe ahụ merenụ juru ndị obodo ahụ anya.

This seems to have a more beneficial effect.	Nke a dị ka ọ nwere mmetụta bara uru karịa.

They want good things.	Ha chọrọ ezigbo ihe.
Other things, however, seem to play out.	Otú ọ dị, ihe ndị ọzọ yiri ka ọ na-egwu egwu.
The important thing is that they always have.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ na ha nwere mgbe niile.
Tomorrow will be their last day.	Echi ga-abụ ụbọchị ikpeazụ ha.
He wants it to be true.	Ọ chọrọ ka ọ bụrụ eziokwu.
He told me a little.	Ọ gwara m ntakịrị.
People want jobs.	Ndị mmadụ chọrọ ọrụ.
Be interested in them.	Nwee mmasị na ha.
This is not an event.	Nke a abụghị ihe omume.
We know what happened, we know who did it.	Anyị ma ihe merenụ, anyị ma onye mere ya.
They were told that something was wrong with their son.	A gwara ha na ọ dị ihe na-eme nwa ha.
It was clearly beyond his comprehension.	O doro anya na ọ karịrị isi ya.
The beauty of the city lies in its inhabitants.	Mma obodo ahụ dị na ndị bi na ya.
I know you are there.	Ama m na ị nọ ebe ahụ.
The room is not comfortable.	Ime ụlọ adịghị mma.
It is a town near the harbor.	Ọ bụ obodo dị nso n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri.
We are far from the water now.	Anyị nọ n'ebe dị anya na mmiri ugbu a.
That is why we do what we do.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị ji eme ihe anyị na-eme.
Among many others.	N'ime ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ.
Some of them impressed me.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ha masịrị ya.
Not only do they have the same style.	Ọ bụghị naanị na ha nwere naanị otu ụdị ahụ.
This is my last year of school.	Nke a bụ afọ ikpeazụ m n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
The buildings are multi-storey.	Ụlọ ndị ahụ dị ọtụtụ ụlọ elu.
He tried to help her.	Ọ gbalịrị inyere ya aka.
We say little.	Anyị na-ekwu ntakịrị.
Now you know why.	Ugbu a, ị maara ihe kpatara ya.
So far, every project we have seen is kind of worthwhile.	Ruo ugbu a, ọrụ ọ bụla anyị hụrụ bụ ụdị uru.
His friend asked him for his newspaper.	Enyi ya jụrụ ya akwụkwọ akụkọ ya.
It lets us know.	Ọ na-eme ka anyị mara.
There are many stories about this city.	Enwere ọtụtụ akụkọ gbasara obodo a.
What he said.	Ihe o kwuru.
Like yours, here.	Dị ka nke gị, ebe a.
At the very least, he could use some of it.	Ma ọ́ dịghị ihe ọzọ, o nwere ike iji ya mee ihe ụfọdụ.
I never said that.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m kwuru otú ahụ.
However, it is not us.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị anyị.
Mine is one of them.	Nke m bụ otu n'ime ha.
By all means, know your thoughts and feelings.	N'ụzọ niile, mara echiche na mmetụta gị.
What he said was very strong.	Ihe o kwuru siri ezigbo ike.
I told him.	Agwara m ya.
That was the only responsibility for him.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị ọrụ nye ya.
It is very beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
You are our people.	Ị bụ ndị anyị.
I do not want to sleep.	Achọghị m ụra.
Where we are going.	Ebe anyị na-aga.
It’s a very important point.	Ọ bụ oke dị mkpa.
It can be anyone.	O nwere ike ịbụ onye ọ bụla.
The woman was impressed.	Akụkọ ahụ masịrị nwanyị ahụ.
Of all of us.	Nke anyị niile.
Many medications.	Ọtụtụ ọgwụ.
He went to see him once in prison.	Ọ gara ịhụ ya n'ụlọ mkpọrọ otu ugboro.
They would not expect that.	Ha agaghị atụ anya otú ahụ.
We have the same idea.	Anyị nwere otu echiche.
But we can not.	Ma anyị nwere ike ọ gaghị.
It seems like the best idea.	Ọ dị ka echiche kacha mma.
It looks good.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị mma.
With them.	Ya na ha.
It's an emergency.	Ọ bụ ihe mberede.
Otherwise, they would never have had a mother.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ha agaraghị enwe nne ma ọlị.
But of course that is not possible.	Ma n'ezie nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume.
Therefore, the case is important.	Ya mere, ikpe ahụ dị mkpa.
Some came without shoes.	Ụfọdụ bịara enweghị akpụkpọ ụkwụ.
There is only one up or down.	Enwere naanị elu ma ọ bụ ala.
Love the simplicity of this bag.	Hụrụ ịdị mfe nke akpa a n'anya.
Maybe they do.	Ma eleghị anya, ha na-eme ya.
Or make music.	Ma ọ bụ mee egwu.
The reasons for this can be many.	Ihe kpatara nke a nwere ike ịdị ọtụtụ.
No matter what he eats.	N'agbanyeghị ihe ọ na-eri.
He hates the head.	Ọ kpọrọ isi ahụ asị.
This had little effect on him.	Nke a nwere mmetụta dị nta n'ebe ọ nọ.
He never wanted to.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ chọrọ.
My time has finally come.	Oge m mechara bịa.
I do some work.	Ana m arụ ọrụ ụfọdụ.
My friend is here.	Enyi m nọ ebe a.
Another power is always a good thing.	Ikike ọzọ bụ ihe dị mma mgbe niile.
They are all lies.	Ha bụ nnọọ ụgha.
No need for money.	Enweghị mkpa ego.
I can't speak.	Enweghị m ike ikwu okwu.
It is made of different materials.	E ji ihe dị iche iche mee ya.
My parents knew what I needed.	Nne na nna m maara ihe dị m mkpa.
He knew nothing, it seemed.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ bụla, ọ dị ka.
No more work.	Enweghị ọrụ ọzọ.
We go where we need to go.	Anyị na-aga ebe achọrọ anyị.
We did it from there.	Anyị si ebe ahụ mee ya.
But it is a terrible situation.	Mana ọ bụ ọnọdụ dị egwu.
Is there a bus station here?	Enwere ọdụ ụgbọ ala nso ebe a?
Great location in the heart of the city.	Nnukwu ọnọdụ n'ime obi obodo.
They are there in the city.	Ha nọ ebe ahụ n'ime obodo.
It is only temporary.	Ọ bụ naanị nwa oge.
He does not seem to be a foreigner.	Ọ dịghị ka ọ bụ onye ala ọzọ.
No job made me happy.	Ọ dịghị ọrụ mere m obi ụtọ.
And immediately.	Na ozugbo.
The test did not detect any problems.	Ule ahụ ahụghị nsogbu ọ bụla.
It will help him, it will help him.	Ọ ga-enyere ya aka, ọ ga-enyere ya aka.
His favorite are women.	Ihe kacha amasị ya bụ ụmụ nwanyị.
Truth is more than emotion.	Eziokwu karịrị mmetụta uche.
He had my first body.	O nwere ahụ m mbụ.
This is not in front of you.	Nke a adịghị n'ihu gị.
They are very different, of course.	Ha dị nnọọ iche, n'ezie.
This is a special pleasure.	Nke a bụ ihe obi ụtọ pụrụ iche.
He took the book.	O were akwụkwọ ahụ.
The ball reached me, so it did.	Bọọlụ ahụ rutere n'ebe m nọ, ya mere ya.
I saw that.	Ahụrụ m nke ahụ.
You can do it with your children.	Ị nwere ike ime ya na ụmụ gị.
Not there.	Ọ bụghị ebe ahụ.
But we should not.	Ma anyị ekwesịghị ime.
I think you can tell me not to go.	Echere m na ị nwere ike ịgwa m ka m ghara ịga.
This is you, son.	Nke a bụ gị, nwa.
He came and stayed for a week.	Ọ bịara nọrọ otu izu ụka.
But he tells no more.	Ma, ọ dịghị agwa ọzọ.
He did not want anyone to know about it.	Ọ chọghị ka onye ọ bụla mara banyere ya.
That was a good day.	Nke ahụ bụ ụbọchị ọma.
You should do all you can to help me.	I kwesịrị ime ihe niile i nwere ike ime iji nyere m aka.
You feel like you.	Ọ dị gị ka ọ dị gị.
Most food then was local.	Ọtụtụ nri mgbe ahụ bụ obodo.
You will not have any feelings for what happened there.	Ị gaghị enwe mmetụta ọ bụla maka ihe mere ebe ahụ.
But the challenge, that’s another.	Mana ihe ịma aka ahụ, nke ahụ bụ ihe ọzọ.
But we can move on to our first question.	Mana anyị nwere ike ịga n'ihu na ajụjụ mbụ anyị.
Interview questions did not go well.	Ajụjụ ọnụ ọrụ emeghị nke ọma.
But it’s time to move on.	Ma ọ bụ oge ịga n'ihu.
I know.	Ama m.
I love it so much.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
It is now or after !.	Ọ bụ ugbu a ma ọ bụ mgbe!.
Only dogs.	Naanị nkịta.
But, of course, no one stopped us.	Ma, n'ezie, ọ dịghị onye kwụsịrị anyị.
Better to act fast.	Onye ka mma ime ihe ngwa ngwa.
They are not too strong.	Ha adịghị ike nke ukwuu.
This is what I was told.	Nke a bụ ihe a gwara m.
But you can't do both at the same time.	Ma ị gaghị eme ha abụọ n'otu oge.
He got this.	O nwetara ihe a.
Nothing more than that, for now.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ karịa nke ahụ, maka ugbu a.
At the time, no one really knew what they were.	N'oge ahụ, ọ dịghị onye doro nnọọ anya ihe ha bụ.
Best name.	Aha kacha mma.
Everything is going fast.	Ihe niile na-aga ngwa ngwa.
And green, but not green.	Na akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ, mana ọ bụghị akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ ahụ.
Like your two children.	Dị ka ụmụ gị abụọ.
He does not want to know what you think.	Ọ chọghị ịma ihe i chere banyere ya.
There is a very high temperature.	E nwere nnukwu okpomọkụ.
You are the ones closest to me.	Unu bụ ndị nọ m nso.
They thought they were different.	Ha chere na ha dị iche.
That will happen within weeks.	Na ga-eme n'ime izu.
Did you go here?	Ị gara ebe a?
It is a great opportunity for you.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ohere nye gị.
We are interested.	Anyị nwere mmasị.
That happens a lot.	Nke ahụ na-eme ọtụtụ mgbe.
Just a little bit.	Naanị ntakịrị.
We go fast.	Anyị na-aga ngwa ngwa.
Then it will be stronger than that.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ ga-adị ike karịa ya.
If it were a simple thing, like a monster.	A sị na ọ bụ ihe dị mfe, dị ka nnukwu anụ mmiri.
No one else is around.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ gburugburu.
The boat stopped at shore.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ kwụsịrị n'akụkụ mmiri.
Nothing else happened, of course.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ mere, n'ezie.
Time is everything.	Oge bụ ihe niile.
I think.	M na-eche.
The first is beauty.	Nke mbụ bụ mma.
The woman's throat suddenly collapsed.	Agba nwanyị ahụ dara na mberede.
It is hard work.	Ọ bụ ọrụ siri ike.
No you will not work.	Mba ị gaghị arụ ọrụ.
Time for a bed!	Oge maka akwa!
I was just kidding.	Naanị m na-egwu egwu.
It is ten o'clock.	Ọ bụ elekere iri.
At this point, we went to the village.	N'otu oge a, anyị gara n'ime obodo.
He told her not to go out.	Ọ gwara ya ka ọ ghara ịpụ.
It's really bad.	Ọ dị njọ n'ezie.
I am still there.	A ka nọ m ebe ahụ.
But in this case, it is really true.	Mana na nke a, ọ bụ eziokwu n'ezie.
No one has.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere.
Of course, the book is really fun.	N'ezie, akwụkwọ na-atọ ụtọ n'ezie.
Again, here we go again.	Ọzọ, ebe a ka anyị na-aga ọzọ.
I have a lot of girlfriends, but no real friends.	Enwere m ọtụtụ enyi nwanyị, mana ọ nweghị ezigbo ndị enyi.
The mother gave birth to a daughter.	Nne ahụ mụrụ nwa nwanyị.
Can you play this song?	Ị nwere ike ịkpọ egwu a?
Or for my sake.	Ma ọ bụ n'ihi m.
That it is really another case.	Na ọ bụ n'ezie ikpe ọzọ.
That is not the case now.	Nke ahụ abụghị okwu ugbu a.
So fun.	Ya mere na-atọ ụtọ.
I think medicine.	Echere m ọgwụ.
I'll stay here for two hours.	Aga m anọ ebe a awa abụọ.
This is your problem.	Nke a bụ nsogbu gị.
This is not the way.	Nke a abụghị ụzọ.
Because my song is mine.	N'ihi na abụ m bụ m.
That is obvious.	Nke ahụ doro anya.
There again, he thought.	N'ebe ahụ ọzọ, o chere.
But you do not know.	Ma ị maghị.
He asked the girl if she wanted to, and he said no.	Ọ jụrụ nwa agbọghọ ahụ ma ọ̀ chọrọ ya, ọ sị mba.
In my eyes.	Na anya m.
I have skin.	Enwere m akpụkpọ anụ.
I love it so high and love how it plays.	M hụrụ n'anya ya mere elu na hụrụ n'anya otú o si egwu egwuregwu.
He was with his mother.	Ya na nne ya nọ.
It is different from the previous one.	Ọ dị iche na nke gara aga.
I don't want you to be upset.	Achọghị m ka ị were ya iwe.
But it can really be.	Ma ọ pụrụ n'ezie.
The other is similar.	Nke ọzọ yiri ya.
This is not possible.	Nke a agaghị ekwe omume.
He does not feel like he is in the country.	Ọ naghị adị ya ka ọ̀ nọ ná mba ahụ.
I'll tell you when.	Aga m agwa gị mgbe.
But then he spoke to someone.	Ma o mechara gwa mmadụ okwu.
Transportation is their most important commodity.	Ụgbọ njem bụ ngwa ahịa ha kacha mkpa.
However, it makes sense to go the other way.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya ịga n'akụkụ nke ọzọ.
He was angry.	Iwe were ya.
We are waiting for a different time.	Anyị na-eche oge dị iche.
Of course, it is important.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ihe dị mkpa.
He ordered his favorite breakfast.	O nyere iwu nri ụtụtụ kacha amasị ya.
It was a new life before me, a new year.	Ọ bụ ndụ ọhụrụ n'ihu m, na afọ ọhụrụ.
The student looked at his lesson.	Nwa akwụkwọ ahụ lere anya n'ihe ọmụmụ ya.
It is behind us.	Ọ dị n'azụ anyị.
The trip here is fun.	Njem ebe a dị ụtọ.
That is all life.	Ndụ niile bụ nke ahụ.
Only one of our sons.	Naanị otu nwa anyị nwoke.
Just a movie.	Naanị ihe nkiri.
He still has it.	Ọ ka nwere ya.

He knows, of course.	Ọ maara, n'ezie.
Often, it is the way they do it.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ọ bụ otú ha si eme ya.
I am not a judge.	Abụghị m onye ikpe.
The difference, the negative.	Ihe dị iche, ihe adịghị mma.
Or it should not be.	Ma ọ bụ na o kwesịghị inwe.
Then several things happened at once.	Mgbe ahụ, ọtụtụ ihe mere otu mgbe.
Tell me what's going on.	Gwa m ihe na-eme.
There was a party.	E nwere oriri n'ebe ahụ.
It doesn’t look like type.	Ọ naghị adị ka ụdị.
People drink their coffee.	Ndị mmadụ na-aṅụ kọfị ha.
Friends.	Enyi.
We need to get out of our way quickly.	Anyị kwesịrị ịpụ n'ụzọ anyị ngwa ngwa.
He was sentenced to four years in prison.	A mara ya ikpe ịga mkpọrọ afọ anọ.
But problems began quickly.	Ma nsogbu malitere ngwa ngwa.
Of course, he does the right thing.	N'ezie, ọ na-eme ihe dị mma.
There is a great deal of music.	Enwere nnukwu egwu egwu.

You look so cute!	Ị mara ezigbo mma!
I don't want anything away from home.	Achọghị m ihe ọ bụla pụọ ​​n'ụlọ.
It's impossible.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
I was angry.	Iwe were m ya.
It can happen to anyone at any time.	O nwere ike ime onye ọ bụla n'oge ọ bụla.
Do whatever he wants.	Mee ihe ọ bụla ọ chọrọ.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
We do not know how.	Anyị amaghị ka o si mee.
The supermarket was packed.	Nnukwu ụlọ ahịa ahụ juru ebe niile.
One of the many small benefits of the project.	Otu n'ime ọtụtụ obere uru nke ọrụ ahụ.
And everything works fine.	Na ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
All negative events.	Ihe omume niile na-adịghị mma.
That is bad.	Nke ahụ dị njọ.
The venue is awesome.	Ebe nkiri ahụ dị egwu.
But when one can, he will do it.	Ma mgbe mmadụ nwere ike, ọ ga-eme ya.
The aunt looked on carefully.	Nwanne nne ahụ lere anya nke ọma.

He made it a small task.	O mere ya obere ọrụ.
You do that most of the day.	Ị na-eme nke ahụ ọtụtụ ụbọchị ụbọchị a.
This study has some limitations.	Ọmụmụ ihe a nwere oke ụfọdụ.

He is very surprised.	O juru ya anya nke ukwuu.
She is terrified of swimming.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya nke ukwuu maka igwu mmiri.
She never talked about her childhood.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-ekwu banyere nwata ya.

He was amazed.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.

He told himself that this would be the last trip.	Ọ gwara onwe ya na nke a ga-abụ njem ikpeazụ.
He thought it was very cold.	O chere na ọ bụ ezigbo oyi.
The messenger went from door to door.	Onye ozi ahụ gara site n’ụlọ ruo n’ọnụ ụzọ.
I do not have that.	Anaghị m enwe nke ahụ.
But there is more truth in that.	Ma, e nwere ọtụtụ eziokwu na nke ahụ.
The problem is that you are one of them.	Ihe isi ike bụ na ị bụ otu n'ime ha.
That they will do whatever you want.	Na ha ga-eme ihe ọ bụla ị chọrọ.
Tough, perfect.	Ndị siri ike, zuru oke.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ọ bụ nwanyị mara mma.
They have me in a beautiful place.	Ha nwere m n'ebe mara mma mara mma.
It seems to me.	O yiri ka ọ bụ m kpatara.
There are many places for information and information available today.	Enwere ọtụtụ ebe maka ozi na ozi dị taa.
Then they looked.	Mgbe ahụ, ha lere anya.
The skin is perfect.	Akpụkpọ ahụ zuru oke.
This is how children play.	Otu a ka ụmụaka si egwu egwu.
Thank you for your comment.	Daalụ maka okwu gị.
Hardly anyone goes there at this time.	O siri ike onye ọ bụla na-aga ebe ahụ n'oge a.
I expect the same from you.	Ana m atụ anya otu ihe ahụ n'aka gị.
Another time he was fine.	Oge ọzọ o ji mma.
We have time.	Anyị nwere oge.
The old house is new again.	Ụlọ ochie dị ọhụrụ ọzọ.
We are traveling.	Anyị na-eme njem njem.
I do not like it.	Adịghị m mma na ya.
They have a lot of things.	Ha nwere ọtụtụ ihe.
It was very difficult at first.	Ọ siri ezigbo ike na mbụ.
That's the favorite.	Nke ahụ kacha amasị.
More than that, he has a special gift.	Karịa nke ahụ, o nwere onyinye pụrụ iche.
Of course it is.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ya.
I'm fine anyway.	Adị m mma n'agbanyeghị.
He ate a great lunch.	O riri nnukwu nri ehihie.
This time, however, it will be different.	Otú ọ dị, n'oge a, ọ ga-adị iche.
In a sense, it is a good idea.	N'otu echiche, ọ bụ ezi echiche.
But they may not want to do so.	Ma o nwere ike ịbụ na ha achọghị ime otú ahụ.
Or, at first.	Ma ọ bụ, na mbụ.
This time he really died.	N'oge a, ọ nwụrụ n'ezie.
You got me in a bad time.	Ị nwetara m n'oge ọjọọ.
Awesome music.	Egwu dị egwu.
I want to keep you healthy.	Achọrọ m ime ka ahụ dị gị mma.
The power is high.	Ike ahụ dị elu.
She is well supported by her parents.	O kwere nne na nna ya aka nke ọma.
I never looked at them myself.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m lere ha n'onwe m.
I do not want to do this.	Achọghị m ime nke a.
Me, and many others in my gut.	Mụ, na ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ n'afọ m.
You feel like you can help your teammates.	Ọ dị gị ka ị nwere ike inyere ndị otu gị aka.
People know who you are.	Ndị mmadụ ma onye ị bụ.
The fact is, he can, but he does not want to.	Nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na o nwere ike, ma ọ chọghị.
This book has a fantastic name.	Akwụkwọ a nwere aha dị egwu.
This is another thing that happened two years ago.	Nke a bụ ihe ọzọ mere afọ abụọ gara aga.
At first, he could see nothing.	Na mbụ, ọ dịghị ihe ọ pụrụ ịhụ.
He will not see war again.	Ọ gaghị ahụ ọgụ ọzọ.
It makes the job a little more fun.	Ọ na-eme ka ọrụ ahụ dị ntakịrị karịa.
It was good that his hand was free again.	Ọ dị mma ka aka ya nwee onwe ya ọzọ.
Provide the necessary funds.	Nye ego ndị dị mkpa.
Then he suddenly asked in awe.	Mgbe ahụ ọ jụrụ na mberede na egwu ya.
Suddenly, it didn't work.	Na mberede, ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
I'll see you there.	Aga m ahụ gị ebe ahụ.
People here say.	Ndị mmadụ ebe a na-ekwu.
You are not the type of woman.	Ị bụghị ụdị nwanyị ahụ.
A lot of work has begun.	Ọtụtụ ọrụ malitere.
She said that the last thought everyone had was for their mother.	O kwuru na echiche ikpeazụ onye ọ bụla nwere bụ maka nne ha.
The floodwaters continued for several days.	Mmiri ahụ gara n'ihu ruo ọtụtụ ụbọchị.
We stayed with them right away.	Anyị na ha nọrọ ozugbo.
Because there are fees.	N'ihi na enwere ụgwọ.
Everything about dogs.	Ihe niile gbasara nkịta.
It is very useful for that.	Ọ bara uru nke ukwuu maka nke ahụ.
It took more than a year to conceive.	O were ihe karịrị otu afọ ime ya.
If they do not, it is fine.	Ọ bụrụ na ha emeghị, ọ dị mma.
The only problem is you get them there.	Naanị nsogbu bụ ị nweta ha ebe ahụ.
Many liked it.	Mmasị ya masịrị ọtụtụ ndị.
That can be a worthwhile endeavor.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ omume bara uru.
It seemed the same day.	O yiri otu ụbọchị ahụ.
In ten years.	Na afọ iri.
That was three days ago.	Nke ahụ bụ ụbọchị atọ gara aga.
Power surrounded the door and through it.	Ike gbara gburugburu ọnụ ụzọ na site na ya.
For women, it is the same drink.	Maka ụmụ nwanyị, ọ bụ otu ihe ọṅụṅụ.
It is hard work.	Ọ bụ ọrụ siri ike.
But no.	Ma ọ dịghị.
That doesn't make sense.	Nke ahụ enweghị isi.
It has value.	Ọ nwere ọnụ ahịa.
Take your weapon.	Were ngwa ọgụ gị.
No one else is behind.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ nọ n'azụ.
He took his time.	O were oge ya.
It is still my fault.	Ọ ka bụ m kpatara.
I was a party girl for a while.	Abụ m nwa agbọghọ na-eme oriri na ọṅụṅụ ruo nwa oge.
Their son is in prison.	Nwa ha nwoke nọ n'ụlọ mkpọrọ.
Let's rest for ten minutes.	Ka anyị zuru ike nkeji iri.
Is it successful ?.	Ọ bụ ihe ịga nke ọma?.
They can do whatever they want.	Ha nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla ha chọrọ.
That is what you told us.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ị gwara anyị.
He speaks of his fear of heights.	Ọ na-ekwu maka egwu ya nke ịdị elu.
But it's good.	Mana ọ dị mma.
I am small.	Adị m obere.
However, several things need to be done.	Otú ọ dị, ekwesịrị ime ọtụtụ isi ihe.
It will be something else.	Ọ ga-abụ ihe ọzọ.
Things are not going well for you right now.	Ihe anaghị adị gị mma ugbu a.
You can see what can happen.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ihe nwere ike ime.
He’s good to be a good player.	Ọ dị mma ka ezigbo onye egwuregwu.
I like it.	Ọ na-atọ m ụtọ.
Basically, the rules are the same.	N'ụzọ bụ isi, iwu bụ otu.
Not in a positive or negative way.	Ọ bụghị n'ụzọ dị mma ma ọ bụ nke ọjọọ.
It's not as good as you think.	Ọ dịghị mma dị ka i chere.
You will help us.	Ị ga-enyere anyị aka.
He ate his lunch alone.	Naanị ya rie nri ehihie ya.
So there is a lot to be done.	Ya mere enwere ọtụtụ ihe a ga-eme.
None of the patients needed another port.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ndị ọrịa chọrọ ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ọzọ.
The concept of the cloud.	Echiche nke igwe ojii.
She may well have been married to only one man.	Ọ ga-abụ na ọ bụ naanị otu nwoke ka ọ ma bụ di.
This is his hometown.	Nke a bụ obodo ya.
He often challenged me.	Ọtụtụ mgbe ọ na-ama m aka.
Just be yourself.	Naanị bụrụ onwe gị.
So it works from the inside.	Ya mere, ọ na-arụ ọrụ site n'ime.
And do it well.	Ma mee ya nke ọma.
We have no money.	Anyị enweghị ego.
This you will want to do yourself.	Nke a ị ga-achọ ime n'onwe gị.
There are only the first two examples.	Enwere naanị ihe atụ abụọ nke mbụ.
I am the head of the company there.	Abụ m onye isi ụlọ ọrụ ebe ahụ.
We ran as fast as we could.	Anyị gbara ọsọ ọsọ ka anyị nwere ike.
If they can find something to use it for, that makes me happy.	Ọ bụrụ na ha nwere ike ịchọta ihe eji eme ya, nke ahụ na-eme m obi ụtọ.
One thing is certain.	Otu ihe doro anya.
How do you feel?	Kedu ka isi siri dị gị mma?
Some games you feel like going or whatever.	Ụfọdụ egwuregwu ị na-enwe mmetụta ka ọ na-aga ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
I never wanted what happened to your family.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chọrọ ka ihe mere ezinụlọ gị.
It's a kind of funny story.	Ọ bụ ụdị akụkọ na-atọ ọchị.
There is still room for more.	A ka nwere ohere maka ihe ndị ọzọ.
Know what your words, body language, and actions really mean.	Mara ihe okwu gị, asụsụ ahụ gị, na omume gị na-ekwu n'ezie.
Where is this place?	Kedu ebe ebe a bụ?
You wait and see.	I chere wee hụ.
Soon.	Oge adịghị anya.
She left home with tears in her eyes.	O ji anya mmiri pụọ n’ụlọ.
Still, he continued.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ gara n'ihu.
And more than you.	Na karịa gị.
This time is no more.	Oge a abụghị ihe ọzọ.
You can't, no.	Ị nweghị ike, ọ dịghị.
First name of it.	Aha mbụ nke ya.
You can do this very easily.	Ị nwere ike ime nke a dị nnọọ mfe.
There are others just like you.	E nwere ndị ọzọ dị ka gị n'ezie.
I do not want.	Achọghị m.
It was my first job.	Ọ bụ ọrụ mbụ m.
No time to find another first employee.	Enweghị oge ịchọta onye ọrụ mbụ ọzọ.
I looked around the house.	M lere anya gburugburu ụlọ ahụ.
It's easy on students.	Ọ dị mfe na ụmụ akwụkwọ.
Let the fiery spirits come and make a fire.	Ka ndị mmụọ ọkụ bịa ka ha mee ọkụ.
Just the truth.	Naanị eziokwu.
Do you see what he has just done?	Ị hụrụ ihe ọ ka mere?
He does his job and does it well.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ ya ma na-eme ya nke ọma.
They do not trade.	Ha anaghị azụ ahịa.
The greater the better.	Nke ka ukwuu ka mma.
The station is overcrowded.	Ndị njem juru n'ọdụ ụgbọ ahụ.
That makes me very sick.	Nke ahụ na-eme m ahụ nke ukwuu.
He is glad he did not see her.	Obi dị ya ụtọ na ọ naghị ahụ anya ya.
There is nothing else here now.	Ọ nweghị ihe ọzọ dị ebe a ugbu a.
I will tell you everything when you get here.	Aga m agwa gị ihe niile mgbe ị rutere ebe a.
Shoes that work with a wardrobe.	Akpụkpọ ụkwụ na-arụ ọrụ na uwe ụlọ.
The fighting stopped abruptly.	Ọgụ ahụ kwụsịrị na mberede.
He is far happier than he was at the time.	Obi dị ya ụtọ nke ukwuu karịa ka o nwere n'oge.
I will not let it happen.	Agaghị m ekwe ka ọ mee.
Just one other city.	Naanị otu obodo ọzọ.
But it may be true.	Ma ọ nwere ike ịbụ eziokwu.
I need a husband.	Achọrọ m di.
You are obviously sitting there.	O doro anya na ị nọ ọdụ ebe ahụ.
That will be just like you.	Nke ahụ ga-adị nnọọ ka gị.
It's a worse color to see with power.	Ọ bụ agba ka njọ ịhụ na ike.
For itself, it has no effect or cause.	Maka onwe ya, o nweghị mmetụta ma ọ bụ ihe kpatara ya.
This time, it was different.	N'oge a, e ji ụzọ dị iche.
No high, no.	Mba elu, mba.
I will not be able to find a job.	Agaghị m enwe ike ịchọta ọrụ.
Couples who did so may.	Di na nwunye ndị mere ihe ahụ pụrụ.
She is afraid.	O ji ụjọ chere ya.
One thing is for sure.	Otu ihe o ji n'aka.
I want the baby well.	Achọrọ m nwata ahụ nke ọma.
His program will be successful.	Ihe omume ya ga-aga nke ọma.
The anger subsided.	Iwe ahụ kwụsịrị.
I was hungry, I was always hungry.	Agụụ na-agụ m, agụụ na-agụ m mgbe niile.
It is still smaller than that.	Ọ ka dị obere karịa ya.
He is the only one.	Ọ bụ naanị ya.
There is one first and another.	E nwere nke mbụ na nke ọzọ.
I miss him, too.	A na m atụ uche ya, kwa.
Since then, the application has been fast paced.	Kemgbe ahụ, ngwa ahụ dị ngwa ngwa.
She probably had only one son.	O yikarịrị ka ọ nwere naanị otu nwa nwoke.
You like each other.	Ị na-amasị ibe gị.
The trip was exciting.	Njem ahụ nwere mmasị.
If nothing else, it is him.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, ọ bụ ya.
I do not know why, only.	Amaghị ihe kpatara ya, ọ bụ naanị.
They have a bar for dog owners.	Ha nwere ụlọ mmanya maka ndị nwere nkịta.
I do not want it to stop.	Achọghị m ka ọ kwụsị.
Money is not an issue.	Ego abụghị okwu.
That’s great.	Nke ahụ dị ukwuu.
I have no weapons.	Enweghị m ngwa ọgụ.
Then they sit down again.	Ha wee nọdụ ala ọzọ.
The same thing can happen here.	Otu ihe ahụ nwere ike ime ebe a.
Let me know if you would like more.	Mee ka m mara ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ ọzọ.
What most people do not realize is that such countries exist.	Ihe ọtụtụ ndị amaghị bụ na mba ndị dị otú ahụ dị.
Every minute is awesome.	Nkeji ọ bụla dị egwu.
That will not happen here.	Nke ahụ agaghị eme ebe a.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Amaghị m na e nwere ihe dị otú ahụ.
You do not know when your last time will come.	Ị maghị mgbe oge ikpeazụ gị ga-abịa.
But he needs someone to do it.	Ma ọ chọrọ onye ga-eme ya.
Sleep through breakfast.	Ụra site na nri ụtụtụ.
We should use two.	Anyị kwesịrị iji abụọ mee ihe.
The room was filled with fear.	Egwu juru n'ime ụlọ ahụ.
Anger does not work.	Iwe iwe agaghị eme nke ọma.
Face it beside me.	Na-eche ihu ya n'akụkụ m.
But he didn't like her.	Ma o nweghị mmasị n'ebe ọ nọ.
Special uncle.	Nwanne nna pụrụ iche.
Different things appeal to everyone.	Ihe dị iche iche na-amasị onye ọ bụla.
But it does not run.	Ma ọ naghị agba ọsọ.
They just don't care.	Ọ dị ha ka ha achọghị ịma.
By itself, he would not be a bad person.	N'onwe ya, ọ gaghị abụ onye ọjọọ.
We will not hear it.	Anyị agaghị anụ ya.
Never.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bụla.
I say to you it is the best.	Asị m gị na ya ihe kacha mma.
He will do many things today.	Ọ ga-eme ọtụtụ ihe taa.
Shortly after our arrival, a party started.	Obere oge anyị rutere, oriri na ọṅụṅụ malitere.
I am even happier.	Enwere m obi ụtọ karịa.
Eat with others.	Gị na ndị ọzọ rie nri.
Wait for it.	Chere ịnọ ya.
You will not find it there.	Ị gaghị ahụ ya n'ebe ahụ.
I think he told you not to call him again at work.	Echere m na ọ gwara gị ka ị ghara ịkpọ ya ọzọ n'ebe ọrụ.
They will be ready for another day.	Ha ga-adị njikere maka ụbọchị ọzọ.
I hope it is good.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ dị mma.
You have good eyesight.	Ị nwere ezigbo anya.
Lots of problems.	Ọtụtụ nsogbu.
All is well.	Ihe niile dị mma.
Now if you do not want to.	Ugbu a ọ bụrụ na ị chọghị.
You must come.	Ị ga-abịa.
Driving should be awesome.	Ịnya ụgbọ gị kwesịrị ịdị egwu.
The language has friends.	Asụsụ ahụ ya nwere enyi.
Impact.	Mmetụta dị elu.
Or the circumstances of his death, for that matter.	Ma ọ bụ ọnọdụ ndị ọ nwụrụ, maka nke ahụ.
Of course, he knew that was not true.	N'ezie, ọ maara na nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
What man did.	Ihe mmadụ mere.
They both know how much money he has made.	Ha abụọ ma ego ole o mere.
I was in this game once.	Anọ m na egwuregwu a otu ugboro.
Go relax.	Gaa zuru ike.
It was set on fire.	A gbara ya ọkụ.
But the people.	Ma ndị ahụ.
You could have done better.	Ị gaara eme karịa.
We are not close.	Anyị anọghị nso.
Court is nearby.	Ụlọ ikpe dị nso.
All students have problems with this.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ niile nwere nsogbu na nke a.
Maybe it's worth doing anything.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bara uru ime ihe ọ bụla.
We do not want your opportunity.	Anyị achọghị ohere gị.
There are three people in the room.	Enwere mmadụ atọ n'ime ụlọ ahụ.
He wanted to tell me something, but his mouth was full.	Ọ na-achọ ịgwa m ihe, mana ọnụ ya juru.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
I like to see what others have to offer.	Ọ na-amasị m ịhụ ihe ndị ọzọ nwere inye.
These are good people.	Ndị a bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
They are just things.	Ha bụ naanị ihe.
Not to do.	Ọ bụghị ime ihe.
She is just waiting.	Ọ na-eche nnọọ.
I think a little.	Echere m ntakịrị.
Some medicines are expensive.	Ọgwụ ụfọdụ dị ọnụ.
Which is an uninteresting one.	Nke bụ onye na-enweghị mmasị.
He expected more.	Ọ tụrụ anya karịa.
But there is a time.	Ma enwere oge.
More important.	Ihe ka mkpa.
They do everything from scratch.	Ha na-eme ihe niile site na mbụ.
His main points are the following.	Isi echiche ya bụ ihe ndị a.
Saying that he knows you and you will help him.	Na-ekwu na ọ maara gị na ị ga-enyere ya aka.
That is why he is doing this.	Ọ bụ ya mere o ji eme nke a.
This, he said, is the key to success.	Nke a, o kwuru, bụ ụzọ isi gaa nke ọma.
He did not know what to do.	Ọ maghị ihe ha kwesịrị ime.
I stopped.	M kwụsịrị.
There are many opportunities for all of our ideas.	Enwere ọtụtụ ohere maka echiche anyị niile.
He was evidently thinking about his own history.	O doro anya na ọ nọ na-eche banyere akụkọ ihe mere eme nke ya.
Certainly not a man.	O doro anya na ọ bụghị nwoke.
The girl is his.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ bụ nke ya.
For example, see how it works.	Dị ka ihe atụ ka i wee hụ otú ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
I have little idea.	Enwere m obere echiche.
User language.	Asụsụ onye ọrụ.
Or at least it should be.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, o kwesịrị ịbụ.
The man is wearing old clothes.	Nwoke ahụ yi uwe ochie.
All the girls are happy.	Ụmụ agbọghọ niile na-enwe obi ụtọ.
Let’s keep it simple.	Ka anyị mee ka ọ dị mfe.
It seems almost as good to be true.	Ọ dị ka ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ dị mma ịbụ eziokwu.
We are accustomed to the cold weather.	Ihu igwe oyi mara anyị ahụ́.
The main problem is lack of space.	Isi nsogbu bụ enweghị ohere.
That is what you need.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ị chọrọ.
Everyone has their own job.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ọrụ ya.
But he went on to say, this is not true.	Ma, ọ gara n'ihu, nke a abụghị eziokwu.
I can’t do it, anyway.	Enweghị m ike ime ya, n'agbanyeghị.
They are both close.	Ha abụọ nọ nso.
You just think.	Ị na-eche naanị.
These are bad, bad people.	Ndị a bụ ndị ọjọọ, ndị ọjọọ.
He made coffee.	O mere kọfị.
I want to know what happened there.	Achọrọ m ịma ihe mere ebe ahụ.
What can you do?	Kedu ihe ị ga-eme?
They only took an hour.	Ha were naanị elekere.
The second would be the weather.	Nke abụọ ga-abụ ihu igwe.
There are still believers.	A ka nwere ndị kwere na ya.
But it is a real dog.	Ma ọ bụ ezigbo nkịta.
Great music.	Ezigbo egwu.
So we have some kind of hand in that.	Ya mere, anyị nwere ụdị aka na nke ahụ.
He knows how to do it.	Ọ maara otú e si eme ya.
He gave money.	O nyere ego.
Where will he go now.	Ebee ka ọ ga-aga ugbu a.
Get there as fast as you can.	Gaa ebe ahụ ngwa ngwa ka ị nwere ike.
How easy if some are.	Kedu ka ọ dị mfe ma ọ bụrụ na ụfọdụ dị.
This is not a bad thing.	Nke a abụghị ihe ọjọọ.
This you can do.	Nke a ị nwere ike ime.
If the head goes fast.	Ọ bụrụ na isi na-aga ngwa ngwa.
He knows people love him.	Ọ ma na ndị mmadụ hụrụ ya n’anya.
It is his birthday.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị ọmụmụ ya.
They go immediately in.	Ha na-aga ozugbo na.
You will make me happy, making everything possible.	Ị ga-eme m obi ụtọ, na-eme ka ihe niile kwere omume.
It's better tonight.	Ọ ka mma n'abalị a.
It’s delicious and good.	Ọ dị ụtọ ma dị mma.
You cannot do everything yourself.	Ị gaghị eme ihe niile n'onwe gị.
Of course nothing happens.	N'ezie ọ dịghị ihe na-eme.
You go up and take them.	Ị na-aga elu were ha.
None of us know what happened to them.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị maara ihe mere ha.
It is obviously long.	O doro anya na ọ dị ogologo.
This requires foreign space.	Nke a chọrọ ohere ala ọzọ.
There is nothing and everything at once.	Enweghị ihe ọ bụla na ihe niile n'otu oge.
I know it's not me.	Ama m na ọ bụghị m.
Our plan is this.	Atụmatụ anyị bụ nke a.
You provide everything for this company.	Ị nyere gị ihe niile maka ụlọ ọrụ a.
The plan is simple.	Atụmatụ ahụ dị mfe.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.	Eji m n’aka na ọ ga-abịa ebe a ngwa ngwa.
I do not expect such things.	Anaghị m atụ anya ihe ndị dị otú ahụ.
He did what he did.	O mere ihe o mere.
This can take weeks or months.	Nke a nwere ike were izu ma ọ bụ ọnwa.
The news came as little hope.	Akụkọ ahụ bịara dị ka ntakịrị olileanya.
A man and his wife live in the same house.	Otu nwoke na nwunye ya bi n’ụlọ ahụ.
One is a good job.	Otu bụ ezigbo ọrụ ọjọọ.
He thought they were just men.	O chere na ha bụ naanị ụmụ nwoke.
He will not do it alone.	Ọ gaghị eme naanị ya.
He had no weaknesses or confidence for that.	O nweghị adịghị ike ma ọ bụ obi ike maka nke ahụ.
This seems high.	Nke a dị ka ọ dị elu.
Everything about the idea was very good.	Ihe niile gbasara echiche ahụ dara ezigbo mma.
That is the only thing we can do.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị ihe anyị nwere ike ime.
This book is absolutely perfect.	Akwụkwọ a zuru oke n'ezie.
But nothing more than that.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ karịa nke ahụ.
One thing is certain.	Otu ihe doro anya.
Or a city or two.	Ma ọ bụ obodo ma ọ bụ abụọ.
They have an archer.	Ha nwere onye na-agba ụta.
So it goes on.	Ya mere ọ na-aga n'ihu.
We can not go out.	Anyị enweghị ike ịpụ.
You are not bad at this really.	Ị adịghị njọ na nke a n'ezie.
It is a busy morning.	Ọ bụ ụtụtụ ọrụ n'aka.
For a short time.	Maka obere oge a.
A new climate problem.	Nsogbu ọhụrụ nke ihu igwe.
Heart of one.	Obi nke otu.
No one else is needed.	Achọghị onye ọzọ.
Read me always.	Na-agụ m mgbe ọ bụla.
I did not know any of this at the time.	Amaghị m nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe a n'oge ahụ.
We appreciate that.	Anyị ji nke ahụ kpọrọ ihe.
They are beautiful.	Ha mara mma.
It was never easy.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ dị mfe.
Here is another.	Ebe a bụ ihe ọzọ.
But he had many friends.	Ma o nwere ọtụtụ ndị enyi.
Now, it's not that simple.	Ugbu a, ọ bụghị otú ahụ dị mfe.
This building has it and more.	Ụlọ a nwere ya na ihe ndị ọzọ.

He was surprised to see me.	O juru ya anya ịhụ m.
He is in a supermarket.	Ọ nọ na nnukwu ụlọ ahịa.
He started driving.	Ọ malitere ịnya ụgbọ ala.
That is not true.	Nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.

I think we are the best team.	Echere m na anyị bụ ndị otu kacha mma.
They do not always need them.	Ọ naghị adị ha mkpa mgbe niile.
I quit my job.	M kwụsịrị ọrụ m.
That would be stupid.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ nzuzu.
Money needs it.	Ego chọrọ ya.
Just a hard word.	Naanị okwu siri ike.
As soon as we had a baby in the family.	Ozugbo anyị mụrụ nwa ọhụrụ n'ime ezinụlọ.
It may be the last chance we have.	O nwere ike ịbụ ohere ikpeazụ anyị ga-enwe.
Do the same old thing.	Mee otu ihe ochie ahụ.
And we want everything we can get.	Na anyị chọrọ ihe ọ bụla anyị nwere ike nweta.
It was fresh from a morning nap.	Ọ dị ọhụrụ site na ụra ụtụtụ.
But not an idea or anything like that.	Ma ọ bụghị echiche ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla dị otú ahụ.
Surely such a thing would be foolish.	N'ezie, ihe dị otú ahụ ga-abụ ihe nzuzu.
Going there, but not there.	Ịga ebe ahụ, ma ọ bụghị ebe ahụ.
When he saw them, he ran to meet them.	Mgbe ọ hụrụ ha, ọ na-agba ọsọ nke ukwuu.
It is useful in different situations.	Ọ bara uru na ọnọdụ dị iche iche.
This was the last song before we went home.	Nke a bụ egwu ikpeazụ tupu anyị ala n'ụlọ.
I was wondering who he was.	M nọ na-eche onye ọ bụ.
Not the way he thought.	Ọ bụghị n'ụzọ o chere.

Obviously, there is a lot of manna.	N'ụzọ doro anya, enwere nnukwu mana.
I do not know what to do.	Amaghị m ihe m ga-eme ya.
Two of them died during the operation.	Mmadụ abụọ n'ime ha nwụrụ n'oge a na-arụ ọrụ ahụ.
For others, it will be something new.	Maka ndị ọzọ, ọ ga-abụ ihe ọhụrụ.
However, we cannot continue with it.	Otú ọ dị, anyị enweghị ike iso ya gaa n'ihu.
This time is no different.	Oge a abụghị ihe ọzọ.
The needy are not good.	Ndị nọ ná mkpa adịghị mma.
And a police officer.	Na onye uwe ojii.
I have known him for many years.	M maara ya nke ọma kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ gara aga.
This was not one of those times.	Nke a abụghị otu n'ime oge ndị ahụ.
He did so even though he knew it.	O mere ya n'agbanyeghị na ọ maara nke ahụ.
No matter where you are, it seems like a bad place.	N'agbanyeghị ebe ị nọ, ọ dị ka ebe adịghị mma.
It's really hard.	O siri ike n'ezie.
He went into the countryside	Ọ gara n'ime ime obodo
The first pregnancy started well.	Ime mbụ malitere nke ọma.
This situation occurs for a reason.	Ọnọdụ a na-eme maka ihe kpatara ya.
No, you will not have that!	Mba, ị gaghị enwe nke ahụ!
This is a legal issue, not a family one.	Nke a bụ okwu iwu, ọ bụghị nke ezinụlọ.
Some members of the community were friendly.	Ụfọdụ ndị obodo ahụ nwere omume enyi.
The kids are coming and going.	Ụmụaka na-abịa na-aga.
So take it there.	Ya mere were ya n'ebe ahụ.
This is a financial institution.	Nke a bụ ụlọ ọrụ ego.
He was telling the truth about one thing.	O kwuru eziokwu banyere otu ihe.
But let's not get out of the way.	Ma ka anyị ghara isi n'ụzọ.
This gave me confidence.	Nke a were m obi ike.
His work makes him travel almost constantly.	Ọrụ ya na-eme ka ọ na-eme njem ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ mgbe niile.
So that they can do whatever they want.	Ka ha nwee ike ime ihe masịrị ha.
Your father asks.	Nna gị jụrụ gị.
Two are male and the other is female.	Abụọ n'ime ha bụ nwoke ma onye nke ọzọ bụ nwanyị.
He is doing well.	Ọ na-eme nke ọma.
He told me that the house belonged to me.	Ọ gwara m na ụlọ ahụ bụ nke m.
Current events are different.	Ihe omume ugbu a dị iche.
He now realizes that he does not know what to do with it.	Ọ ghọtara ugbu a na ya amaghị ihe ọ ga-eji ya mee.
A good job.	Otu ezigbo ọrụ.
At first you got better, of course.	Na mbụ ị nwetara mma, n'ezie.
Are you sure that is perfect?	Ị ji n'aka na nke ahụ zuru oke?
Worst of all.	Nke kacha njọ.
Four patients needed emergency care.	Ndị ọrịa anọ chọrọ ọrụ mberede.

The police car did not find.	Ụgbọ ala ndị uwe ojii ahụghị.
Things are not right.	Ihe adịghị mma.
He began to speak.	Ọ malitere ikwu ihe.
That’s because the game is fun.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ihi na egwuregwu ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
It is so.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
He asked again if it was necessary.	Ọ jụrụ ọzọ ma ọ dị mkpa.

Happy day.	Ụbọchị obi ụtọ.
Great thing.	Nnukwu ihe.
Think of it as an ongoing hunger.	Were ya dị ka agụụ na-aga n'ihu.
Then his authority.	Mgbe ahụ ikike ya.
I hope that is useful.	Enwere m olileanya na nke ahụ bara uru.
It was just the girl.	Ọ bụ naanị nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
It may be different from before.	O nwere ike ịdị iche na mbụ.
You can't talk to him.	Ị nweghị ike ịgwa ya okwu.
This is no time to be emotional.	Nke a abụghị oge inwe mmetụta uche.
Sometimes it is just the subject.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ bụ naanị isi okwu ya.
I have another reason for coming.	Enwere m ihe ọzọ mere m ji bịa.
That is what we want.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị chọrọ.
Maybe he was the one who could do anything.	Ma eleghị anya, ya na ya bụ onye nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla.
He understands that now.	Ọ ghọtara nke ahụ ugbu a.
The doctor looked at him carefully.	Dọkịta ahụ lere ya anya nke ọma.
We do not allow play.	Anyị anaghị ekwe ka egwu egwu.
He has no special ideas.	O nweghị echiche pụrụ iche.
Of course, my company employee did.	N'ezie, onye ọrụ ụlọ ọrụ m mere.
Works well for everyone.	Na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma maka onye ọ bụla.
But of course, we do not know how much time we have.	Mana n'ezie, anyị amaghị oge ole anyị nwere.
The boat docked at a nearby port.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ kwụsịrị n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri dị nso.
Some things still happened.	Ụfọdụ ihe ka mere.
He told me to sit anywhere.	Ọ gwara m ka m nọrọ ọdụ ebe ọ bụla.
Now that is a new idea.	Ugbu a nke ahụ bụ echiche ọhụrụ.
The price has dropped dramatically.	Ọnụ ahịa a dara nke ukwuu.
He is a good athlete.	Ọ bụ ezigbo onye egwuregwu.

And he came and sat down beside me.	O wee bịa nọdụ ala n'akụkụ m.
They will not do anything special.	Ha agaghị eme ihe ọ bụla pụrụ iche.

Nice to see you.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ gị.

He saw his hand the next night.	Ọ hụrụ aka ya n'abalị ọzọ.
And the flight attendants.	Na ndị ọrụ ụgbọ elu ahụ.
But special moments need new ideas.	Ma oge pụrụ iche chọrọ echiche ọhụrụ.
I like being the first.	Ọ na-amasị m ịbụ onye mbụ.
I think the idea works.	Echere m na echiche ahụ na-arụ ọrụ.
Give me a chance.	Nye m ohere.
In summer.	Na okpomọkụ.

We talked about the same thing.	Anyị kwuru banyere otu ihe ahụ.
Every minute as it reads.	Nkeji ọ bụla dị ka ọ na-agụ.
But once you do, you will be glad you did!	Ma ozugbo i mere ya, obi ga-adị gị ụtọ na i mere!.
For the latter, therefore.	N'ihi nke ikpeazụ, ya mere.
I really want him to be surprised.	Achọrọ m n'ezie ka ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.
A mouth forward.	A ọnụ n'ihu.
We will be quick to judge.	Anyị ga-adị ngwa ikpe ikpe.

I would love to see where these things go !.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịhụ ebe ihe ndị a na-aga!.
Expect people to like it.	Na-atụ anya na ndị mmadụ masịrị ya.
He did wrong, not me.	O mere ihe ọjọọ, ọ bụghị m.
It is a very old form of travel.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ochie ụdị njem.
This is a hospital.	Nke a bụ ụlọ ọrịa.
Some are old and some are new.	Ụfọdụ bụ ochie ma ụfọdụ dị ọhụrụ.
Although he works on stories.	N'agbanyeghị na ọ na-arụ ọrụ na akụkọ.
However, he never left me.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mgbe ọ hapụrụ m.
We should not call it here.	Anyị ekwesịghị ịkpọ ya ebe a.
But it’s beautiful, its texture is good.	Ma ọ mara mma, ihe ya dị mma.
It was his job to go.	Ọ bụ ọrụ ya ịga.
It really happened.	O mere n'ezie.
But, as it turned out, she was right.	Ma, dị ka o si mee, o kwuru eziokwu.
Hopefully, we can continue to do that.	Anyị nwere olileanya, anyị nwere ike ịga n'ihu na-eme nke ahụ.
I think, it looks like the picture.	Echere m, ọ dị ka foto ahụ.
Who gave me fire.	Onye nyere m ọkụ.
Maybe I feel better along the way.	Eleghị anya ọ dị m mma n'ụzọ.
Of course, it is the book, but there is something else.	N'ezie, ọ bụ akwụkwọ ahụ, ma e nwere ihe ọzọ.
Nothing about it has weight.	Ọ dịghị ihe gbasara ya nwere ibu.
Physical body.	Ahụ anụ ahụ.
Many are his wife.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha bụ nwunye ya.
I never miss you.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m na-atụ uche gị.
But of course, there is nothing wrong with that.	Mana n'ezie, ọ nweghị ihe dị njọ na nke ahụ.
Or children.	Ma ọ bụ ụmụaka.
He knows me very well.	Ọ ma m nke ukwuu.
I will not do that.	Agaghị m eme nke ahụ.
Who are they.	Kedu ndị bụ.
Let them be free.	Ka ha nwee onwe ha.
He is currently working on a local film project.	Ugbu a ọ na-arụ ọrụ ihe nkiri obodo.
I didn't love them, I loved her.	Ahụghị m ha n'anya, ahụrụ m ya nso.
What will happen there.	Ihe ga-eme n'ebe ahụ.
Acting is a thing.	Ime ihe bụ ihe.
They are women.	Ha bụ ụmụ nwanyị.
I think there will be some situations where we do that.	Echere m na a ga-enwe ọnọdụ ụfọdụ ebe anyị na-eme nke ahụ.
We know now more than ever before.	Anyị maara ugbu a karịa ka anyị mara na mbụ.
He was in the room from the beginning.	Ọ nọ n'ime ụlọ site na mbụ.
Tell us languages ​​you can help.	Gwa anyị asụsụ ndị ị nwere ike inye aka.
And he said.	O wee sị.
But they will not feel any more.	Mana ha agaghị enwe mmetụta ọ bụla ọzọ.
My favorite is the music app.	Ihe kacha amasị m bụ ngwa egwu.
That is what they are.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ha bụ.
They all made their way.	Ha niile mere ya ụzọ.
I want to get out of it.	Achọrọ m ịpụ n'ime ya.
So the only problem is transportation.	Ya mere, naanị nsogbu bụ ụgbọ njem.
However, the speed is better.	Otú ọ dị, ngwa ngwa ka mma.
That is just the kind of person he is.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ ụdị onye ọ bụ.
The idea is not to think about it.	Echiche ahụ abụghị iche banyere ya.
Expect that.	Na-atụ anya nke ahụ.
It took almost two hours.	O were ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ awa abụọ.
It was almost cold last night.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ oyi ka ọ dị n'abalị ụnyahụ.
I do not know how to do it today.	Amaghị m otu esi eme ya taa.
He does not know where you are going.	Ọ maghị ebe ị na-aga.
It's just that the lights should not be working.	Ọ bụ naanị na ọkụ ndị ahụ ekwesịghị ịdị na-arụ ọrụ.
Now it is more than that.	Ugbu a ọ karịrị nke ahụ.
A few of those women were my friends and family.	Ole na ole n'ime ụmụ nwanyị ndị ahụ bụ ndị enyi m na ndị ezinụlọ m.
Sit it down here.	Nọdụ ala ya ebe a.
And not only that.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị nke ahụ.
Of course he would.	N'ezie, ọ ga-eme ya.
This fish is long and long.	Azụ a dị ogologo ma dị ogologo.
They talked about their boyfriends.	Ha kwuru gbasara ndị enyi ha nwoke.
I know them well.	Amaara m ha nke ọma.
We do not know what he did.	Anyị amaghị ihe o mere.
He hopes to stay here for a while.	Ọ tụrụ anya na ọ ga-anọ ebe a ruo oge ụfọdụ.
He wanted to be able.	Ọ chọrọ inwe ike.
Be brave and promise.	Nwee obi ike ma mee nkwa.
First we need some words.	Mbụ anyị chọrọ ụfọdụ okwu.
These places are uninhabited.	Ebe ndị a enweghị mmadụ.
At that moment, the other person immediately started on his phone.	N'oge ahụ, onye nke ọzọ malitere ozugbo na ekwentị ya.
Can we do this ?.	Anyị nwere ike ime nke a?.
We know these things are true.	Anyị maara na ihe ndị a bụ eziokwu.
Which is true.	Nke bụ eziokwu.
Now he is gone.	Ugbu a ọ pụọ.
He is a well-known athlete.	Ọ bụ onye egwuregwu ama ama.
It was one of those years.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime afọ ndị ahụ.
There is a lot of money.	E nwere nnukwu ego.
It can do bad things, worse.	O nwere ike ime ihe dị njọ, ka njọ.
He slapped her.	Ọ mara ya ụra.
It doesn’t seem scary or anything.	Ọ dịghị ka ọ dị egwu ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
Plans require something from him, too.	Atụmatụ chọrọ ihe n'aka ya, kwa.
We are as successful as we can.	Anyị na-aga nke ọma ka anyị nwere ike.
You know why.	Ị maara ihe kpatara nke ahụ.
But in my opinion, it really is.	Ma n'otu echiche, ọ bụ n'ezie.
Last week's football game was emotional.	Egwuregwu bọọlụ nke izu gara aga nwere mmetụta uche.
Everything is kind.	Ihe niile bụ ụdị.
You may not know it is there.	O nwere ike ị gaghị ama na ọ nọ ebe ahụ.
It's hard for that.	O siri ike maka otu ahụ.
The question is whether they want you here.	Ajụjụ bụ ma ha chọrọ gị ebe a.
That is what he will do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ ga-eme.
We will not do that now.	Anyị agaghị eme nke ahụ ugbu a.
But that is the most important.	Mana nke ahụ kacha mkpa.
He pointed to the far side.	Ọ tụrụ aka n'akụkụ dị anya.
You need my help.	Ị chọrọ enyemaka m.
It seems to be.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị.
He looked at his watch.	O lere anya na elekere ya.
And everything works.	Na ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ.
I try not to think.	M na-agbalị ka m ghara iche.
I really think he is on vacation.	Echere m n'ezie na ọ na-eme ezumike.
To make people happy.	Iji mee ka ndị mmadụ nwee obi ụtọ.
He thought he understood that.	O chere na ọ ghọtara nke ahụ.
People left that to themselves.	Ndị mmadụ hapụrụ nke ahụ n'onwe ha.
The water is bad.	Mmiri adịghị mma.
He may be hungry.	O nwere ike ịbụ agụụ na-agụ ya.

Everyone hates them.	Onye ọ bụla kpọrọ ha asị.
He does not know where you live.	Ọ maghị ebe i bi.

It doesn't have to be this way.	O kwesịghị ịdị otú ahụ.
But we don't have to go now.	Ma anyị ekwesịghị ịga ugbu a.
I do not like them.	Adịghị m mma na ha.
I'm happy.	Obi dị m ụtọ.
No, that is not a problem.	Mba, nke ahụ enweghị nsogbu.
I can beat him.	Enwere m ike ịma ya ụra.
Let's get it.	Ka anyị nweta ya.
I know he is coming here.	Ama m na ọ na-abịa ebe a.
This is easy when you have good information.	Nke a dị mfe mgbe ị nwere ezigbo ozi.
I do not know they did the second.	Amaghị m na ha mere nke abụọ.
I like playing and dancing.	Ime egwuregwu na ịgba egwu na-amasị m.

The power requirement of such a load is very important.	Ihe achọrọ ike nke ibu dị otú ahụ dị oke mkpa.
Tell me what to do.	Gwa m ihe m ga-eme.
How can you do the same?	Kedu ka ị ga-esi mee otu ihe ahụ?.
One is the concept of truth.	Otu bụ echiche nke eziokwu.
Spirit.	Mmụọ.
It was what he expected.	Ọ bụ ihe ọ tụrụ anya ya.
Now, about that day.	Ugbu a, gbasara ụbọchị ahụ.
Not so much, he thought.	Ọ bụghị nke ukwuu, o chere.
Alcohol is stronger today than ever before.	Mmanya taa siri ike karịa ka ọ dị na mbụ.
The other is the work his children do.	Ọrụ nke ọzọ bụ ụmụ ya na-arụ.
He doesn't seem to want to talk.	O yiri ka ọ naghị achọ ikwu okwu.
I have a reason to love you.	Enwere m ihe mere m ga-eji hụ gị n'anya.
These new machines work well.	Igwe ọhụrụ ndị a na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
Twice as true.	Ugboro abụọ dị ka eziokwu.
Breakfast is served at any time.	A na-eri nri ụtụtụ oge ọ bụla.

He tells us what we need right away.	Ọ gwara anyị ihe anyị ga-achọ ozugbo.
His eyes are different than before.	Anya ya dị iche na mbụ.
We go to school every day.	Anyị bụ ndị na-aga ụlọ akwụkwọ kwa ụbọchị.
I do not understand what he wants.	Aghọtaghị m ihe ọ chọrọ.
They have a great special fight.	Ha nwere nnukwu ọgụ pụrụ iche.
I'm sorry you can't see it.	Ọ dị m nwute na ị gaghị ahụ ya.
There is this smile on your face.	Enwere anya ọchị a na ihu gị.
She is scared.	Ụjọ dị n’anya ya.
Others may use some services.	Ndị ọzọ nwere ike iji ụfọdụ ọrụ.
That was clear on his face.	Nke ahụ doro anya na ihu ya.
What do you think about this ?.	Kedu ihe ị chere maka nke a?.
Let's see what happens.	Ka anyị hụ ihe merenụ.
It is a multi-room apartment.	Ya bụ ụlọ nwere ọtụtụ ọnụ ụlọ.
Probably the point.	Ma eleghị anya, okwu ahụ bụ isi.
He looks different now.	Ọ dị ka onye dị iche ugbu a.
This city has three hospitals.	Obodo a nwere ụlọ ọgwụ atọ.
Maybe something was wrong with the store.	O nwere ike ịbụ na ọ dị ihe na-eme n'ụlọ ahịa ahụ.
That's true.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu.
It's about.	Ọ bụ gbasara ya.

But he was alone, so his words were in vain.	Ma ọ nọ naanị ya, ya mere okwu ya enweghị isi.
You know what to do.	Ị maara ihe ị ga-eme.
It seems reasonable that the mother has a responsibility to do.	O yiri ihe ezi uche dị na ya na nne nwere ibu ọrụ ime.
He will leave the house.	Ọ ga-esi n'ụlọ ahụ pụọ.
This is a hospital, of course.	Nke a bụ ụlọ ọgwụ, n'ezie.
But you can see what it looks like.	Ma ị nwere ike ịhụ ihe ọ dị ka.
You are at home now.	Ị nọ n'ụlọ gị ugbu a.
He looked at his wine.	O lere anya na mmanya ya.
I have a better idea.	Enwere m echiche ka mma.

No one seems to be better.	Ọ dịghị onye yiri ka ọ ka mma.
We will make this trip as fast as we can.	Anyị ga-eme njem a ngwa ngwa ka anyị nwere ike.
He did not know the names.	Ọ maghị aha ndị ahụ.
That is very beautiful.	Nke ahụ mara mma nke ukwuu.
Before the trial.	Tupu ikpe ikpe.
He is a brother.	Ọ bụ nwanne.
It seems to be working well so far.	Ọ dị ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma ruo ugbu a.
We hope the letter will help us.	Anyị tụrụ anya na akwụkwọ ozi ahụ ga-enyere anyị aka.
Some are good with one or the other.	Ụfọdụ dị mma na otu ma ọ bụ nke ọzọ.
I like this idea.	Echiche a na-amasị m.
He is very surprised.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
Customer service on the phone is unhelpful.	Ọrụ ndị ahịa na ekwentị enweghị enyemaka.
Do this for only two weeks.	Mee nke a naanị izu abụọ.
But it leaves us with two questions.	Ma ọ hapụrụ anyị ajụjụ abụọ.
This has been happening for years.	Nke a bụ ihe na-eme kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
I do not want anyone in this picture.	Achọghị m onye na foto a.
You are on the beach.	Ị nọ n'akụkụ oke osimiri.
He said it seemed to be.	O kwuru na ọ dị ka ọ dị.

It seems like it's too good to be true.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị oke mma ịbụ eziokwu.

The reality is quite different.	Eziokwu ahụ dị nnọọ iche.

Everything that happens is true.	Ihe niile na-eme bụ eziokwu.

One new, one old.	Otu ọhụrụ, otu ochie.
But it needs to be done.	Ma ekwesịrị ime ya.

Maybe he expected it too much.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ tụrụ anya ya nke ukwuu.
You want to know about this woman.	Ị na-achọ ịma banyere nwanyị a.

Ideal for travel and working dogs.	Ọ dị mma maka njem na nkịta na-arụ ọrụ.
To run, you only need one pair and one pair of shoes.	Iji na-agba ọsọ, ịchọrọ naanị ụzọ na otu akpụkpọ ụkwụ.
Of course, this is one of the effects.	N'ezie, nke a bụ otu n'ime mmetụta ya.

Life in prison was hard.	Ndụ n'ụlọ mkpọrọ siri ike.

That is, he will be able if he gets the chance.	Ya bụ, ọ ga-enwe ike ma ọ nweta ohere.
Most of his work is.	Ọtụtụ ọrụ ya bụ.

All of this is beyond me.	Ihe a niile karịrị m.
Nothing is easy.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị mfe.
He bought new shoes.	Ọ zụtara akpụkpọ ụkwụ ọhụrụ.
There are many small ports.	Enwere ọtụtụ obere ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri.

But someone put it here for a reason.	Ma mmadụ tinyere ya ebe a maka ihe kpatara ya.

Fear is a powerful emotion.	Ụjọ bụ mmetụta dị ike.

On both sides, as you said.	N'akụkụ abụọ, dị ka i kwuru.

If you think music would make me feel better let me know.	Ọ bụrụ na ị chere na egwu ga-eme ka ọ ka mma mee ka m mara.
We do power.	Anyị na-eme ike.
Your next question is simple.	Ajụjụ gị ọzọ dị mfe.

You are a good couple.	Ị bụ ezigbo di na nwunye.
He is a man of few words.	Ọ bụ nwoke na-ekwu okwu ole na ole.

Most of us will never.	Ọtụtụ n'ime anyị agaghị.
None are alive.	Ọ dịghị nke dị ndụ.
I still happened to be here to do it.	M ka mere na ebe a na-eme ya.
There are many difficulties.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe isi ike.
Our birthday was very similar.	Ụbọchị ọmụmụ anyị yiri nnọọ.
But it's not really about going there.	Ma ọ bụghị n'ezie banyere ịga ebe.
He had his life in them.	O nwere ndụ ya n'ime ha.

I had a smile all night.	Enwere m ihu ọchị n'abalị niile.
His feelings for her are clear.	Mmetụta ya n'ebe ọ nọ doro anya.
He was angry.	Iwe were ya.
Now is not the time.	Ugbu a abụghị oge.
He allowed this to happen.	O kwere ka ihe a mee.
Take my time to go home.	Were oge m ịla n'ụlọ.
Please think so.	Biko chere na nke ahụ.
That is difficult.	Nke ahụ siri ike.
He’s smart, it seems.	Ọ mara ihe, ọ dị ka.
This is not a threat.	Nke a abụghị egwu.
It is really foolish to do.	Ọ bụ ụdị ihe nzuzu ime n'ezie.
There is the idea.	Enwere echiche ahụ.
Life was hard there.	Ndụ siri ike ebe ahụ.
That is something we need to know.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị kwesịrị ịma.
I could not go further than that.	Enweghị m ike ịga n'ihu karịa nke ahụ.
However, we are still working.	Otú ọ dị, anyị ka na-arụ ọrụ.
Again, we do not know.	Ọzọ, anyị amaghị.
Others are ahead.	Ndị ọzọ nọ n’ihu.
We should do this in different schools.	Anyị kwesịrị ime nke a na ụlọ akwụkwọ dị iche iche.
I don’t think what could be the other side.	Echeghị m ihe nwere ike ịbụ n'akụkụ nke ọzọ.
He had no chance of surviving.	O nweghị ohere ọ ga-adị ndụ.
The two kids talk about school.	Ụmụaka abụọ ahụ na-ekwu maka ụlọ akwụkwọ.
The feeling of fear is positive.	Mmetụta ụjọ ahụ dị mma.
His timing may be good.	Oge ya nwere ike ịdị mma.
It has many windows.	O nwere ọtụtụ windo.
The river is nearby.	Osimiri ahụ dị nso.
I liked that in the morning.	Ọ masịrị m nke ahụ n'ụtụtụ.
I was going there.	M na-aga ebe ahụ.
There are times when you.	O nwere oge mgbe ị.
I don't know why they are so interested.	Amaghị m ihe mere ha ji nwee mmasị nke ukwuu.
This can be done.	Enwere ike ime nke a.
Then the law will be.	Mgbe ahụ, iwu ga-abụ.
Therefore, these words do not work in the flesh.	Ya mere, okwu ndị a adịghị arụ ọrụ anụ ahụ.
They challenge us and our loved ones.	Ha na-ama anyị na ndị anyị hụrụ n’anya aka.
This restaurant is known for its delicious food.	A maara ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ a maka nri dị ụtọ ya.
He spoke to the people.	Ọ gwara ndị mmadụ okwu.
However, the food plan is good.	Otú ọ dị, atụmatụ nri dị mma.
In fact, it is the first time.	N'ezie, ọ bụ nke mbụ ya.

How to do it.	Otu esi eme ya.
Of course, they did not do it again.	N’ezie, ha emeghị ụzọ ọzọ.
It is very important.	Ọ dị mkpa nke ukwuu.
I don’t want this to happen to anyone else.	Achọghị m ka ihe a mee onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
He will need new shoes.	Ọ ga-achọ akpụkpọ ụkwụ ọhụrụ.
One who does not exist.	Onye na-adịghị adị.
Then there is the weight issue.	Mgbe ahụ, e nwere okwu ibu ibu.
As it is here.	Dị ka ọ dị ihe ebe a.
I'd like some information, please.	Ozi ụfọdụ ga-amasị m, biko.
That did not happen.	Nke ahụ emeghị.
I know they have nothing to say about good.	Ama m na ha enweghị ihe ọ bụla ikwu banyere ihe ọma.
You need to help in some way.	Ị chọrọ inye aka n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
Here is a simple example of this.	Nke a bụ ihe atụ dị mfe nke nke a.
We are husband and wife.	Anyị bụ nwoke na nwunye.
They knew the city from which he had come.	Ha ma obodo o si bịa.
He is a good athlete.	Ọ bụ ezigbo onye egwuregwu.
The first is a pretty simple thing than the last.	Nke mbụ bụ ihe dị mma dị mfe karịa nke ikpeazụ.
By doing this.	Site n'ime nke a.
Which is what he did.	Nke bụ ihe o mere.
This is it.	Nke a dị na ya.
Why not now ?.	Gịnị kpatara na ọ bụghị ugbu a?.
I would like someone to help me with this problem.	Ọ ga-amasị m ka mmadụ nyere m aka na nsogbu a.
This interview is required to last one hour.	Ajụjụ ọnụ a chọrọ ka ọ were otu awa.
I do not use it for anything.	Anaghị m eji ya maka ihe ọ bụla.
These things are not the same.	Ihe ndị a abụghị otu ihe.
This is very good.	Nke a dị ezigbo mma.
We can not see anything.	Anyị enweghị ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla.
So let us be reasonable.	Ya mere, ka anyị nwee ezi uche.
More valuable than less.	Bara uru karịa obere.
For my country.	Maka obodo m.
His house is in the countryside, not the countryside.	Ụlọ ya dị n'ime obodo, ọ bụghị ime obodo.
Recreation area.	Ebe ezumike.
This cannot be true.	Nke a enweghị ike ịbụ eziokwu.
The time of day is different.	Oge ụbọchị dị iche.
He alone did not go there.	Naanị ya agaghị ebe ahụ.
I saw the problem.	Ahụrụ m nsogbu ahụ.
I do not know how to proceed.	Amaghị m ka m ga-esi gaa n'ihu.
Of course, the house is very nice.	N'ezie, ụlọ ahụ dị nnọọ mma.
The journey was difficult.	Njem ahụ siri ike.
Poor work environment does not lead to good performance.	Ebe ọrụ na-adịghị mma anaghị eme ka arụ ọrụ dị mma.
Not good, maybe.	Ọ dịghị mma, eleghị anya.
There are three key words.	E nwere okwu atọ dị mkpa.
Nonsense.	Okwu nzuzu.
This happened last year.	Ihe a mere n'afọ gara aga.
He looked at himself.	O lere onwe ya anya.
Dogs are not pets.	Nkịta abụghị anụ ụlọ.
I love old books.	Ahụrụ m akwụkwọ ochie n'anya.
He went to his mother's house to be.	Ọ gara n’ụlọ nne ya ka ọ bụrụ.
This may be due to a few reasons.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ n'ihi ihe ole na ole.
None of the team did.	Ọ nweghị ihe otu ọ bụla mere.
Since then, he has had no one else in his life.	Kemgbe ahụ, o nweghị onye ọzọ na ndụ ya.
The year is going fast.	Afọ na-aga ngwa ngwa.
He said he would like that more.	O kwuru na nke ahụ ga-amasị ya karịa.
I am no longer afraid.	A naghị atụ m egwu ọzọ.
My face really.	Ihu m n'ezie.
He would not let me rest.	Ọ gaghị ekwe ka m zuru ike.
It’s like what’s happening behind his skin.	Ọ dị ka ihe na-eme n'azụ akpụkpọ ahụ ya.
This vegetable is delicious.	Akwụkwọ nri a na-atọ ụtọ.
I am sensible.	Abụ m onye nwere ezi uche.
He began to speak in a friendly manner.	Ọ malitere ikwu okwu enyi na enyi.
Do the same thing all the time.	Na-eme otu ihe mgbe niile.
This works well when you know what you are looking for.	Nke a na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma mgbe ị maara ihe ị na-achọ.
Many of them are meaningless.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ya enweghị isi.
But it is a very important thing.	Ma ọ bụ ihe dị ezigbo mkpa.
I do not know where it is.	Amaghị m ebe ọ dị.
Because this is how it is now.	N'ihi na otu a ka ọ dị ugbu a.
This is for you first.	Nke a maka gị mbụ.
We will not back down.	Anyị agaghị ala azụ.
However, we should not go there.	Otú ọ dị, anyị ekwesịghị ịga ebe ahụ.
Or my mother.	Ma ọ bụ nne m.
None of us know what you are anymore.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị maara ihe ị bụ ọzọ.
Just wait a little longer.	Naanị chere ntakịrị ogologo.
The old building collapsed a few years ago.	Ụlọ ochie ahụ dara afọ ole na ole gara aga.
Our staff is smaller than ever.	Ndị ọrụ anyị dị obere karịa ka ọ dị.
He can see that it is coming.	Ọ pụrụ ịhụ na ọ na-abịa.
The time of truth is near.	Oge eziokwu dị nso.
This book is very valuable.	Akwụkwọ a bara ezigbo uru.
This is not required now.	Achọghị nke a ugbu a.
It’s not like a wine test.	Ọ dịghị ka ule mmanya.
I can see it working inside me.	Enwere m ike ịhụ na ọ na-arụ ọrụ n'ime m.
It is the way you think about yourself.	Ọ bụ echiche echiche ị nwere banyere onwe gị.
These books are perfect.	Akwụkwọ ndị a zuru oke.
There is something wrong with their skin.	Ọ nwere ihe adịghị mma na akpụkpọ ahụ ha.
I eat small meals.	M na-eri obere nri.
The man is very nice.	Nwoke ahụ dị nnọọ mma.
He knew why he was there.	Ọ ma ihe mere o ji nọrọ ebe ahụ.
But they are mine now.	Ma ha bụ nke m ugbu a.
It is the same in this example.	Ọ dị otu a n'ihe atụ a.
The others just walked away.	Ndị ọzọ si nnọọ pụọ.
You are the problem here.	Ọ bụ gị bụ nsogbu ebe a.
It simply will not happen.	Ọ gaghị eme nnọọ.
I do not know if you are trying.	Amaghị m na ị na-agbalị.
However, this is not possible.	Otú ọ dị, nke a agaghị ekwe omume.
The beach is pleasant in the summer.	Osimiri na-atọ ụtọ n'oge okpomọkụ.
After all.	Mgbe niile.
He is a well-known musician.	Ọ bụ onye egwu ama ama.
At the same time the rest will be a holiday.	N'otu oge ahụ izu ike ga-abụ ezumike.
He was obviously emotional.	O doro anya na o nwere mmetụta uche.
But I was alone.	Ma enwere naanị m.
They will not work in one.	Ha agaghị arụ ọrụ na otu.
No problem.	Nsogbu adịghị ebe ahụ.
However, when you need them, they are not there.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, mgbe ịchọrọ ha, ha anọghị ebe ahụ.
Time and best friend.	N'oge na ezigbo enyi.
Many good things he did for me there.	Ọtụtụ ihe ọma ọ na-eme m ebe ahụ.
Most likely three.	O yikarịrị ka atọ.
Be our type.	Bụrụ anyị ụdị.
For fish.	Maka azụ.
At first, we looked repeatedly at each other.	Na mbụ, anyị lere anya ugboro ugboro na ibe anyị.
We have been working on it for months.	Anyị na-arụ ọrụ na ya kemgbe ọnwa.
That must have been good, but he was not feeling well.	O yikarịrị ka nke ahụ dị mma, mana ahụ adịghị ya mma.
But this is exactly what we did.	Ma nke a bụ nnọọ ihe anyị mere.
This will be a big challenge.	Nke a ga-abụ nnukwu ihe ịma aka.
You are there, do it.	Ị nọ ebe ahụ, mee ya.
They told us about the bad food.	Ha gwara anyị banyere nri ọjọọ ahụ.
Some said it themselves.	Ụfọdụ kwuru n'onwe ha.
Our city will prosper.	Obodo anyị ga-aga nke ọma.
I know the people he knows.	Amaara m ndị ọ ma.
I just hope for the best one day.	Naanị m na-atụ anya ịdị mma otu ụbọchị.
I think it can be the same.	Echere m na ọ nwere ike ịdị otu ahụ.
I think this time it will not be different.	Echere m na oge a agaghị adị iche.
They will not work.	Ha agaghị arụ ọrụ.
There is little water there.	Obere mmiri dị ebe ahụ.
We need two for these.	Anyị chọrọ abụọ maka ndị a.
I want to do this.	Achọrọ m ime nke a.
The conditions were very difficult.	Ọnọdụ ndị ahụ siri nnọọ ike.
But this time.	Mana oge a.
Some of the work they do is still important.	Ụfọdụ ọrụ ha na-arụ ka dị mkpa.
There today, everything is very well.	N'ebe ahụ taa, ihe niile dị mma nke ọma.
The staff has a good friend.	Ndị ọrụ nwere ezigbo enyi.
Of course, that’s a big deal.	N'ezie, nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ihe.
How we do that is vital.	Otú anyị si eme nke ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa.
These applications cannot help.	Ngwa ndị a enweghị ike inye aka.
There are a lot of good players.	Enwere ọtụtụ ezigbo ndị egwuregwu.
The important facts are as follows.	Eziokwu ndị dị mkpa bụ ndị a.
It's just me.	Ọ bụ naanị m.
The house is like our year.	Ụlọ ahụ dị ka afọ anyị.
I like finding ideas.	Ọ na-amasị m ịchọta echiche.
We are surprised that you did.	O juru anyị anya na i mere ya.
We were both scared.	Anyị abụọ tụrụ egwu.
But there is still a long way to go.	Ma a ka nwere ụzọ dị anya iji gaa.
The meal went well.	Nri gara nke ọma.
When he spoke, he said a lot.	Mgbe o kwuru okwu, o kwuru nke ukwuu.
He can tell the truth.	O nwere ike ikwu eziokwu.
And the form is.	Na ụdị bụ.
Of course he could not find it for him.	N'ezie ọ nweghị ike ịchọta ya n'ebe ọ nọ.
You and I have no job with my daughter.	Gị na mụ na nwa m nwanyị enweghị ọrụ ọ bụla.
The group arrived suddenly.	Ndị otu ahụ rutere na mberede.
The best is always good.	Nke kacha mma dị mma n'oge niile.
He is alive, but only.	Ọ dị ndụ, ma ọ bụ naanị.
However the low temperature conditions are different.	Otú ọ dị na obere okpomọkụ ọnọdụ dị iche.
I have no feelings for it.	Enweghị m mmetụta ọ bụla gbasara ya.
She enjoys being a mother and dancing wood for fun.	Ọ na-atọ ya ụtọ ịbụ nne na ịgba egwu osisi maka ihe ụtọ.
It will only be for both of us.	Ọ ga-abụ naanị maka anyị abụọ.
Speak the truth.	Na-ekwu eziokwu.
I do not know how to help you.	Amaghị m ka m ga-esi nyere gị aka.
But once we leave work, we may not be here.	Ma ozugbo anyị hapụrụ ọrụ, anyị nwere ike ghara ịnọ ebe a.
We really like this place.	Ọ masịrị anyị ebe a nke ọma.
It's hard boy.	O siri ike nwata.
That seemed like a success.	Nke ahụ dị m ka ihe ịga nke ọma.
He thought it was not him.	O chere na ọ bụghị ya.
The opportunity to do something different.	Ohere ime ihe dị iche.
You will not go.	Ị gaghị aga.
You can see why.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ihe kpatara ya.
To know that you are here.	Iji mara na ị nọ ebe a.
Hence our new practice.	N'ihi ya ọhụrụ anyị omume.
He died the next morning.	Ọ nwụrụ n'ụtụtụ echi ya.
If you like traveling, look for ways to travel.	Ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị ịga njem, chọọ ụzọ ị ga-esi mee njem.
Few people know the city.	Ọ bụ mmadụ ole na ole maara obodo ahụ.
He asked questions to get the information.	Ọ jụrụ ajụjụ iji nweta ozi.
Yet, they seem happy and excited.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ha yiri obi ụtọ na obi ụtọ.
Of course you need one color.	N'ezie ị chọrọ otu agba.
The trip took several weeks.	Njem ahụ were ọtụtụ izu.
Obviously this does not work.	O doro anya na nke a anaghị arụ ọrụ.

Inside the car.	N'ime ụgbọ ala ahụ.
They are decorative.	Ha na-achọ mma.
But my hunger is there.	Ma agụụ m dị ebe ahụ.

The city is on the riverbank.	Obodo ahụ dị n'akụkụ osimiri ahụ.
In fact, they are both.	Nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na ọ bụ ha abụọ.
Apparently, they were afraid of what was about to happen.	O doro anya na ha tụrụ egwu ihe na-aga ime.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
Not until he told her.	Ọ bụghị ruo mgbe ọ gwara ya.
But he wanted it, and he liked the feeling.	Ma ọ chọrọ ya, ma mmetụta ahụ masịrị ya.
However, water is liquid.	Otú ọ dị, mmiri bụ mmiri mmiri.
That is the reason, if you are looking for the reason.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe kpatara ya, ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-achọ ihe kpatara ya.
Just his eyes.	Naanị anya ya.
I would not have done it otherwise.	Agaraghị m eme ya ma ọ́ bụghị ya.
They do not last long.	Ha anaghị anọ ogologo.
I talked to my friend.	Agwara m enyi m okwu.

Of course it made me laugh in the interview room.	N'ezie mere m ihe ọchị n'ime ụlọ ajụjụ ọnụ.

But this time he heard the idea.	Ma na nke ugbu a, ọ nụrụ echiche.

She wonders how she feels.	Ọ na-eche otú ọ dị ya.
Just about anything I liked at the time.	Naanị ihe ọ bụla masịrị m n'oge ahụ.
The company has a good reputation in the industry.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ nwere aha ọma na ụlọ ọrụ.

I was trying to find the same man but it was hard.	M na-agbalị ịchọta otu nwoke ahụ mana ọ siri ike.
In a small room without windows.	N'ime obere ụlọ na-enweghị windo.
This is violence and pet.	Nke a bụ ime ihe ike ma mee anụ ụlọ.

He can always work with them toward us.	Ọ nwere ike na-arụ ọrụ na ha mgbe niile n'ebe anyị.

At one time or another it may be necessary to resort to violence.	N'oge ụfọdụ ma ọ bụ ọzọ ọ nwere ike ịdị mkpa iji ime ihe ike.
Search the house, do what you want.	Chọọ n'ụlọ ahụ, mee ihe ị chọrọ.

So we take this seriously.	Ya mere, anyị ji nke a kpọrọ ihe.

But he has no chance to leave now.	Ma o nweghị ohere ịpụ ugbu a.
Morality and hunger are all for him.	Omume na agụụ bụ ihe niile nye ya.

You can stay there for a while.	Enwere ike ịnọ ebe ahụ nwa oge.

Sometimes they run fast, sometimes fast, sometimes not at all.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha na-agba ọsọ ọsọ, mgbe ụfọdụ ngwa ngwa, mgbe ụfọdụ ọ bụghị ma ọlị.
He left the car running.	Ọ hapụrụ ụgbọ ala ahụ na-agba ọsọ.

He was imprisoned.	A tụrụ ya mkpọrọ.

Of course, we asked everyone.	N'ezie, anyị jụrụ onye ọ bụla.
You are very beautiful.	Ị mara mma nke ukwuu.

No words will come, nothing.	Ọ dịghị okwu ga-abịa, ọ dịghị ihe.
We continue to work on this.	Anyị na-aga n'ihu na-arụ ọrụ na nke a.
The head of state is in the room.	Onye isi ala nọ n'ime ụlọ.

The place waits.	Ebe ahụ chere.
He knows how much he likes restaurant food.	Ọ maara otú nri ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ si amasị ya.

Apparently something bad happened.	O doro anya na ihe ọjọọ mere.

That’s where the trial started for me, he thought.	Ebe ahụ ka ikpe a malitere maka m, o chere.
Both types work well.	Ụdị abụọ a na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
The real problem is to make it visible to the public.	Ezigbo nsogbu bụ ime ka ndị mmadụ hụ ya.
He wants me to tell you.	Ọ chọrọ ka m gwa gị.

It's too loose.	Aka ya dara.
But he looked at her.	Ma o lere ya anya.

Eye for eye.	Anya maka anya.
For many others.	Maka ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ.

True, there are other dogs.	Ọ bụ eziokwu, enwere nkịta ndị ọzọ.

The plane is waiting.	Ụgbọ elu na-eche.
It is an example of a word.	Ọ bụ ihe atụ nke okwu.
Events here and in the city are everywhere.	Ihe omume ebe a na n'ime obodo juru ebe niile.

But he knew his plan would not work.	Mana ọ ma na atụmatụ ya agaghị arụ ọrụ.
It will not be allowed.	Ọ gaghị ekwe.
I think it is more.	Echere m na ọ bụ karịa.
They can help.	Ha nwere ike inye aka.
A new era has begun.	Oge ọhụrụ malitere.
We have a meeting for breakfast.	Anyị na-enwe nzukọ maka nri ụtụtụ.
Not after last night.	Ọ bụghị mgbe abalị ikpeazụ.
These are two simple questions.	Ha bụ ajụjụ abụọ dị mfe.
It should be very good.	Ọ kwesịrị ịdị mma nke ukwuu.
This city needs good transportation	Obodo a chọrọ ụgbọ njem nke ọma
Those are the basics.	Ndị ahụ bụ isi.
And is it only for girls.	Na bụ na ya naanị na ụmụ agbọghọ.
The best news.	Akụkọ kacha mma.
But speed is not everything.	Ma ọsọ abụghị ihe niile.
I do not understand the reason for this.	Aghọtaghị m ihe kpatara nke a.
The father is another man.	Nna ahụ bụ nwoke ọzọ.
The woman was there, reading.	Nwanyị ahụ nọ ebe ahụ, na-agụ akwụkwọ.
They are not human.	Ha abụghị mmadụ.
Everyone knows that.	Onye ọ bụla maara nke ahụ.
He made his life every minute.	O mere onwe ya ndụ kwa nkeji.
Not very good.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo mma.
These are the basics.	Ihe ndị a bụ isi.
He spoke to himself angrily.	O were iwe gwa onwe ya okwu.
It's awesome, men are going to do something about it.	Ọ dị oke egwu, ndị nwoke na-aga ime ihe gbasara ya.
There will be great violence.	A ga-enwe nnukwu ime ihe ike.
Trees don't think so.	Osisi echeghị otú ahụ.
The reason is different.	Ihe kpatara ya dị iche.

I feel like our time is near.	Ọ dị m ka oge anyị dị nso.
You know you are like my wife.	Ị mara na ị dị ka nwunye m.
Now comes the main test.	Ugbu a na-abịa na isi ule.
It makes us feel.	Ọ na-eme ka anyị nwee mmetụta.
There is a third chance.	Enwere ohere nke atọ.
We have the right to make our own opinions.	Anyị nwere ikike ime echiche anyị.
I do not, of course.	Enweghị m, n'ezie.
I have many more, if you would like to see them sometimes.	Enwere m ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ, ọ bụrụ na ị ga-achọ ịhụ ha mgbe ụfọdụ.
So that was the first.	Ya mere nke ahụ bụ nke mbụ.
He can say a little about what he saw '.	O nwere ike ikwu ntakịrị ihe ọ hụrụ'.
They may not know about you.	Ha nwere ike ghara ịma gbasara gị.
It scared me.	Ọ tụrụ m egwu.

It is spring now.	Ọ bụ mmiri ugbu a.
It is not known whether he has it or not.	Amaghị ma ọ nwere ma ọ bụ na o nweghị.
He knew he was guilty, everyone knew.	Ọ maara na ikpe mara ya, onye ọ bụla maara.
You are a family.	Ị bụ ezinụlọ.

Now only wine works.	Ugbu a naanị mmanya na-arụ ọrụ.
Everyone needs less space at a time.	Onye ọ bụla na-achọ obere ohere n'otu oge n'otu oge.
He spoke at length about his work.	O kwuru ogologo oge banyere ọrụ ya.
About a year.	Ihe dị ka otu afọ.

Everyone at home.	Ndị niile nọ n'ụlọ.

Views of the stock market.	Echiche nke ahịa ahịa.
But the issue is still money.	Ma okwu ahụ ka bụ ego.
This but it did.	Nke a mana o mere.
I have a book.	Enwere m akwụkwọ.
You know very well.	Ị mara nke ọma.
He told me what he told you.	Ọ gwara m ihe ọ gwara gị.
It's my time.	Ọ bụ oge m.
Just give him your money and get a quick fix.	Naanị nye ya ego gị ma nweta ọkụ ọkụ.
However, it is beautiful.	Otú ọ dị, ọ mara mma.
Some do it in the winter.	Ụfọdụ na-eme ya n'oge oyi.
I would like to.	Ọ ga-amasị m.

No one knows why.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ihe kpatara ya.
I never liked it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ masịrị m.
I don’t want to think about it tonight, not anymore.	Achọghị m iche banyere ya n'abalị a, ọ bụghị ọzọ.
He can do such a thing.	O nwere ike ime ihe dị otú ahụ.
But there is a new problem where this does not exist.	Ma enwere nsogbu ọhụrụ ebe nke a na-adịghị.
The food was delicious.	Nri ahụ juru na ụtọ.
But how? 	Ma olee otú?
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
It's small.	Ọ dị obere.
I sat back.	M nọdụ ala azụ.
I am much bigger than any of them.	Adị m nnukwu ibu karịa nke ọ bụla n'ime ha.
No matter what he says, you are still our son.	N'agbanyeghị ihe ọ na-ekwu, ị ka bụ nwa anyị.
He’s here, he knows now.	Ọ nọ ebe a, ọ maara ugbu a.
He told her it was too cold.	Ọ gwara ya na oyi dị oke oyi.
He told her the bad news.	Ọ gwara ya akụkọ ọjọọ ahụ.
They talk about it at the bar at night.	Ha na-ekwu banyere ya n'ụlọ mmanya n'abalị.
Stop running.	Kwụsị ịgba ọsọ.
Now go and take it.	Ugbu a gaa were ya.
He liked the water.	Mmiri ahụ masịrị ya.
They are all.	Ha niile bụ.
That is what it should be.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe o kwesịrị ịbụ.
We would have seen.	Anyị gaara ahụ ụzọ.
This is a good thing he stopped.	Ihe a dị mma ka ọ kwụsịrị.
But he does it.	Ma ọ na-eme ya.
That would be nice.	Nke ahụ ga-adị mma.
Bad things are happening to him.	Ihe ọjọọ na-eme ya.
He did not really know.	Ọ maghị n'ezie.
We know that everyone can have a better life.	Anyị maara na onye ọ bụla nwere ike nweta ndụ kacha mma.
He was burned for a while.	Ọ gbara ya ọkụ nwa oge.
It would have been better.	Ọ gaara adị mma.
I think you are different.	Echere m na ị dị iche.
I wondered if she did not see that we were not like her.	M nọ na-eche ma ọ̀ ahụghị na anyị adịghị ka ya.
If it is, it will happen.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ ga-abụ, ọ ga-eme.
That sounds good.	Nke ahụ dara nke ọma.
I know people who do well in trouble.	Amaara m ndị na-eme nke ọma na nsogbu.
I know, courage.	Ama m, obi ike.
You can have breakfast at school.	Ị nwere ike iri nri ụtụtụ n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
Let's go to the new restaurant for dinner.	Ka anyị gaa ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ ọhụrụ ahụ maka nri abalị.
He looked at the woman carefully.	O lere nwanyị ahụ anya nke ọma.
It was almost one afternoon.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ otu n'ime ehihie.
Here is a picture of her.	Nke a bụ foto ya.
No one should be the last.	Ọ dịghị onye ekwesịrị ịbụ na nke ikpeazụ.
It was the perfect weather for swimming.	Ọ bụ ihu igwe zuru oke maka igwu mmiri.
This is awesome, you guessed it.	Nke a dị oke egwu, ị chere.
If he were, they would not be friends.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ na-ekwu eziokwu, ha agaraghị abụ enyi.
For example, if trying ,.	Dị ka ihe atụ, ọ bụrụ na-agbalị,.
Of course the difference is true.	N'ezie ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu.
Of course we met again.	N'ezie anyị zutere ọzọ.
It is easy to follow.	Ọ dị mfe iso.
But it will not happen.	Ma ọ gaghị eme.
This time, however, he entered the city.	Otú ọ dị, na nke ugbu a, ọ banyere n'ime obodo.
You thought I was only one night with you.	Ị chere na naanị otu abalị ka mụ na gị nọrọ.
Church, if you go to church.	Ụka, ọ bụrụ na ị na-aga ụka.
That seems logical.	Nke ahụ yiri ezi uche.
It is best not to get upset.	Ọ kacha mma ka ị ghara iwe iwe.
Tell me everything, every last minute.	Gwa m ihe niile, obere ihe ọ bụla ikpeazụ.
That should be good news.	Nke ahụ kwesịrị ịbụ ozi ọma.
It’s a big nonsense.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ihe na-enweghị isi.
And of course not the face he could love.	Na n'ezie ọ bụghị ihu ọ pụrụ ịhụ n'anya.
For us it is an opportunity we give.	Maka anyị ọ bụ ohere anyị inye.
But this is a good example.	Mana nke a bụ ezigbo ihe atụ.
He never left me.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ hapụrụ m.
I do not have it.	Anaghị m enwe ya.
He gave her money.	O nyere ya ego.
The abdomen is skin.	Afọ bụ akpụkpọ anụ.
I say, no sense.	M na-ekwu, enweghị isi.
Some people need to eat small meals.	Ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ kwesịrị iri obere nri.
The time is now three o'clock.	Oge ugbu a bụ elekere atọ.
He said.	O kwuru.
That is good.	Nke ahụ dị mma.
I do not know how bad it is.	Amaghị m ka ọ dị njọ.
I can no longer love.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ n'anya ọzọ.
Every believer.	Onye ọ bụla kwere ekwe.
Have one.	Nwee otu.
It can not be.	O nweghị ike ịbụ.
She smiled at the baby.	O were ọnụ ọchị nwa ọhụrụ ahụ.
He looked at his watch.	O lere anya elekere ya.
But nothing so bad that night.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe na-adịghị njọ otú ahụ n'abalị ahụ.
That should be the case, of course, but men are human.	Nke ahụ dị ka ọ kwesịrị ịdị, n'ezie, mana ụmụ nwoke bụ mmadụ.
Same model from the beginning.	Otu ụdị site na mbụ.
My car broke down on the road.	Ụgbọ ala m dara n'ụzọ.
It made him slow down.	O mere ka ọ ghara ime ihe ngwa ngwa.
This has.	Nke a nwere.
Many other countries do not have the same problem.	Ọtụtụ mba ndị ọzọ adịghị enwe otu nsogbu ahụ.
Whatever they think, they feel great.	Ihe ọ bụla ha na-eche, ha na-enwe mmetụta nke ukwuu.
Of course this is not the case.	N'ezie nke a abụghị ikpe.
Then go back for more because their work is so good.	Mgbe ahụ na-aga azụ maka ihe ndị ọzọ n'ihi na ọrụ ha dị oke mma.
I want you and me here.	Achọrọ m gị na gị ebe a.
You have other girls in your life.	Ị nwere ụmụ agbọghọ ndị ọzọ na ndụ gị.
I want to have a female president.	Achọrọ m inwe onye isi ala nwanyị.
I'm pretty sure.	Eji m n'aka nke ukwuu.
Just perfect.	Naanị zuru oke.
He expected to be at the party.	Ọ tụrụ anya na ọ ga-anọ na oriri ahụ.
But not sure.	Ma ejighị n'aka.
But these may not be the same.	Ma ndị a nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ otu ndị ahụ.
I know these things are.	Amaara m ka ihe ndị a dị.
I do not do that kind of thing.	Anaghị m eme ụdị ihe ahụ.
Big eyes on the man.	Nnukwu anya na nwoke ahụ.
I do not understand why we still think around.	Aghọtaghị m ihe mere anyị ka ji na-eche gburugburu.
This, by the way, is a much stronger law.	Nke a, n'ụzọ ya, bụ iwu dị ike karịa.
It works for me.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka m.
I was angry with you alone.	Iwe were m naanị gị.
My path is actually the worst.	Ụzọ m bụ n'ezie nke kacha njọ.
Because that would not be good.	N'ihi na nke ahụ agaghị adị mma.
So far without success.	Ruo ugbu a na-enweghị ihe ịga nke ọma.
But not many.	Ma ọ bụghị ọtụtụ.
Not his.	Ọ bụghị nke ya.
I have two more.	Enwere m abụọ ọzọ.
He is there now.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ ugbu a.
We do not know why this was done.	Anyị amaghị ihe mere e ji mee nke a.
There is a way for everyone.	Enwere ụzọ maka onye ọ bụla.
Since it is too big.	Ebe ọ dị oke ibu.
Small and ugly.	Obere na adịghị mma.
He wanted only the best for himself.	Ọ chọrọ naanị ihe kacha mma maka onwe ya.
His eyes widened.	Anya ya lere ya anya.
But he had none.	Ma o nweghị nke ọ bụla.
He got angry again.	Iwe were ya ọzọ.
I love your brother.	Ahụrụ m nwanne gị n'anya.
It’s simple and it works.	Ọ dị mfe ma ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
Or more than one woman.	Ma ọ bụ karịa otu nwanyị.
Children go to school at an early age.	Ụmụaka na-aga akwụkwọ mgbe ha ka dị obere.
The theme is simple, not easy.	Isi okwu ebe ahụ dị mfe, ọ dịghị mfe.
He has his own feelings.	O nwere mmetụta nke ya.
But they can help us.	Ma, ha nwere ike inyere anyị aka.
Most of the time, however, we do a little second.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, Otú ọ dị, anyị na-eme ntakịrị nke abụọ.
Dogs have a strong sense of humor.	Nkịta nwere mmetụta dị ike nke isi.
They want to talk.	Ha chọrọ ikwu okwu.
There is no room for doubt.	Enweghị ohere maka obi abụọ.
No one is really interested.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere mmasị n'ezie.
Some of these people love me.	Ụfọdụ n’ime ndị a hụrụ m n’anya.
If something goes wrong, then it is bad.	Ọ bụrụ na ihe adịghị mma, mgbe ahụ ọ dị njọ.
Let us not be side-by-side.	Ka anyị ghara ịdị n'akụkụ.
The past is on their side.	Ihe gara aga dị n'akụkụ ha.
The bow is low.	Ụta dị ala.
Some do well.	Ụfọdụ na-eme nke ọma.
That’s just the thing.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ ihe.
It's stupid.	Ọ bụ nzuzu.
I just left home.	M ka hapụrụ ụlọ.
Tonight it will be my bed.	N'abalị a ọ ga-abụ akwa m.
It has many things.	O nwere ọtụtụ ihe.
Maybe he still does.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ ka na-eme ya.
The application does not need to be beautiful.	Ngwa ahụ adịghị mkpa ka ọ mara mma.
Not really something.	Ọ bụghị n'ezie ihe.
I like you.	Ị masịrị m.
What is he doing?	Gịnị ka ọ na-eme.
Mouth with small child.	Ọnụ na obere nwa.
She does not mind.	Ọ chọghị ịma.
Because you do not know what will happen.	N'ihi na ị maghị ihe na-aga ime.
Of course, it is the same all the time.	N'ezie, ọ bụ otu ihe ahụ n'oge niile.
What he did was wrong.	Ihe o mere adịghị mma otú ahụ.
That is the point.	Nke a bụ isi okwu ahụ.
Many died in the accident.	Ọtụtụ mmadụ nwụrụ n'ihe mberede ahụ.
He was feeling a lot.	Ọ nọ na-enwe mmetụta nke ukwuu.
We both knew it at once.	Anyị abụọ maara ya ozugbo.
I'm sorry, but can't help it.	Ọ dị m nwute, mana enweghị ike inyere ya aka.
Life was beautiful then.	Ndụ mara mma n'oge ahụ.
They talk about it.	Ha na-ekwu maka ya.
There is another one before him.	E nwere otu ọzọ n'ihu ya.
Love the idea !.	Hụrụ echiche ahụ n'anya!.
Nice to see you.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ gị.
Swimming and swimming.	Igwu mmiri na mmiri mmiri.

The matter was successful.	Okwu ahụ gara nke ọma.
Of course he did.	N'ezie ọ chọrọ ya.
What is yours ?.	Kedu ihe bụ nke gị?.
We have food.	Anyị nwere nri.
When you were little, you ran a lot.	Mgbe ị dị obere, ị na-agba ọsọ nke ukwuu.
This should give you the information you need.	Nke a kwesịrị inye gị ozi ịchọrọ.
When they let me, that is.	Mgbe ha kwere ka m, ya bụ.
He never came home.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bịara n'ụlọ.
A girl, alone and pregnant.	Otu nwa agbọghọ, naanị ya na ime.
It is no different anywhere.	Ọ dịghị iche n'ebe ọ bụla.
It will not be good.	Ọ gaghị adị mma.
They just could not see him that way.	Naanị ha apụghị ịhụ ya otú ahụ.
He was waiting for me this morning.	Ọ nọ na-eche m n'ụtụtụ a.
You received the information.	Ị nwetara ozi ahụ.
They have a long way to go.	Ha nwere ogologo njem n’ihu ha.
We hope to see you.	Anyị nwere olileanya ịhụ gị.
You do what you can.	Ị na-eme ihe ị nwere ike ime.
The man was still happy to have his gloves on.	Nwoke ahụ ka nwere obi ụtọ inwe uwe aka ya.
The second man got it right with alcohol.	Nwoke nke abụọ nwetara ya nke ọma na mmanya.
Now, none of those things will happen.	Ugbu a, ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị ahụ ga-eme.
He had a big smile on his face.	O nwere nnukwu ọnụ ọchị na ihu ya.
She has just given birth to her second child, a boy, a few months ago.	Ọ ka mụrụ nwa ya nke abụọ, nwoke, ọnwa ole na ole gara aga.
I was that bad.	Abụ m ihe ọjọọ ahụ.
On his back.	Na azụ ya.
Wonder what he is doing now.	Na-eche ihe ọ na-eme ugbu a.
No one said a word.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru otu okwu.
If anything, things went the other way.	Ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla, ihe gara n'ụzọ ọzọ.
Take what you want.	Were ihe ị chọrọ.
He was reading.	Ọ nọ na-agụ akwụkwọ.
We had a little time together.	Anyị nwere obere oge ọnụ.
I do not know the girl.	Amaghị m nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
It's behind you.	Ọ dị n'azụ gị.
I only have good customers.	Enwere m naanị ndị ahịa mara mma.
He would want that.	Ọ ga-achọ nke ahụ.
Sometimes people say it just makes sense.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ na-ekwu na ọ bụ naanị ezi uche.
The baby's father is still young, probably in his early 20's.	Nna nwa ọhụrụ ahụ ka dị obere, eleghị anya ọ dị ihe dị ka afọ iri abụọ.
But he knew about it.	Ma ọ maara banyere ya.
Very good.	Ezigbo mma.
Still, they may have been called fathers and sons.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ pụrụ ịbụ na e kpọrọ ha maka nna na nwa nwoke.
No new ideas.	Enweghị echiche ọhụrụ.
I can see you for what you really are.	Enwere m ike ịhụ gị maka ihe ị bụ n'ezie.

Wait a moment.	Chere nwa oge.
It is a way of life.	Ọ bụ ụzọ ndụ.

The food is very good.	Nri dị ezigbo mma.
Still, he was the best of friends.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, n'ime ndị enyi niile ọ bụ ya kacha mma.
Always think they are a little low.	Na-eche mgbe niile na ha dị ntakịrị ala.
But mine too.	Mana nke m kwa.

They are very tasty for the first month or so.	Ha na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu maka ọnwa mbụ ma ọ bụ karịa.
He knew that he should tell him everything.	Ọ ma na ya kwesịrị ịgwa ya ihe niile.
I want to help, he said.	Achọrọ m inye aka, o kwuru.
But most of all, he is my best friend.	Ma nke ka nke, ọ bụ ezigbo enyi m.
The weather is terrible today.	Ihu igwe dị egwu taa.
I do not know who they really are.	Amaghị m ndị ha bụ n'ezie.
He wanted me to be happy.	Ọ chọrọ ka m nwee obi ụtọ.
The food is good.	Nri dị mma.
He told the men to hurry.	Ọ gwara ụmụ nwoke ka ha mee ọsọ ọsọ.
He did not know what he had, but he did not care.	Amaghị ihe o nwere, ma ọ chọghị ịma.
Friends of friends.	Ndị enyi enyi.
It smells good.	Ọ na-agba ya mma.
This is better.	Nke a ka mma.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange.	Ruo ugbu a, ọ nweghị onye hụrụ otu.
There is nothing wrong with the game.	Ọ nweghị ihe dị njọ na egwuregwu ahụ.
We will not go down.	Anyị agaghị ala ala.
He knows what his job is.	Ọ ma ihe ọrụ ya bụ.
Let us give a few simple examples.	Ka anyị nye ihe atụ ụfọdụ dị mfe.
He needs to rest.	Ọ chọrọ izu ike.
No one knows what will happen to him.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ihe ga-eme ya.
Pretty much, too.	Onye mara mma, kwa.
Here, get out of the club.	Ebe a, pụọ na ụlọ ịgba egwu ahụ.
But he never lied to me.	Ma n'ezie ọ naghị agwa m okwu ụgha.
You get that right away.	Ị nweta nke ahụ ozugbo.
They make you go.	Ha na-eme ka ị na-aga.
I want to see a little life.	Achọrọ m ịhụ ndụ ntakịrị.
Do a better job.	Mee ọrụ ka mma.
But this is not the case.	Mana nke a abụghị ikpe.
But trouble is near.	Ma nsogbu dị nso.
People will move on.	Ndị mmadụ ga-aga n'ihu.
We all have our best year.	Anyị niile nwere afọ anyị kacha mma.
No one knows how much.	Ọ dịghị onye maara ole.
He had little to offer, but not much.	O nwere ntakịrị ihe nye ya, ma ọ bụghị ọtụtụ.
The giant flesh runs down the aisle.	Nnukwu anụ ahụ na-agba ọsọ na ala.
There is no doubt about some facts in this regard.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na ụfọdụ eziokwu na nke a.
I have a beautiful idea.	Enwere m echiche mara mma.
He might have something there.	O nwere ike inwe ihe n'ebe ahụ.
Go for your heart.	Gaa maka obi gị.
That will never happen today.	Nke ahụ agaghị eme ma ọlị taa.
But my condition was serious.	Ma ọnọdụ m dị njọ nke ukwuu.
She wore her best clothes.	O yiri uwe ya kacha mma.
We were never made to feel like we were on the road.	Ọ dịghị mgbe e mere anyị ka ọ dị anyị ka anyị nọ n'ụzọ.
The truth is this.	Nke bụ eziokwu bụ nke a.
I don't have to be on the road too much.	E kwesịghị m ịnọ n'ụzọ nke ukwuu.
You are condemned for those.	A mara gị ikpe maka ndị ahụ.
Of course, there are times when we get involved, as they say.	N'ezie, e nwere mgbe anyị tinyere aka, dị ka ha na-ekwu.
But that is just my opinion.	Mana nke ahụ bụ naanị echiche nke m.
All my friends were there.	Ndị enyi m niile nọ ebe ahụ.
All other applications are good.	Ngwa ndị ọzọ niile dị mma.
He is not in his room.	Ọ dịghị n'ime ụlọ ya.
It's a little bit different.	Ọ dị ntakịrị ntakịrị.

Impact is important for one.	Mmetụta dị mkpa maka otu.

There is no such thing there.	O nweghị ihe dị otú ahụ n'ebe ahụ.

He was amazed.	Ọ nwere ihe tụrụ ya n'anya.
So we don't do it.	Ya mere, anyị anaghị eme ya.
And that's all about.	Na nke ahụ bụ ihe niile banyere.
They are looking for an early speaker.	Ha na-achọ onye na-ekwu okwu n'oge.
At that time, it will be.	N'oge ahụ, ọ ga-abụ.
This house is human life, as it were.	Ụlọ a ndụ mmadụ, dị ka ọ dị.
He looked at his strength.	O lere ike ya anya.
This will only make you worse.	Nke a ga-eme ka ị ka njọ.

One of two things will happen.	Otu n'ime ihe abụọ ga-eme.

It is our job to communicate.	Ọ bụ ọrụ anyị ikwu okwu.

This is because others love him alone.	Nke a bụ n'ihi na ndị ọzọ hụrụ naanị ya.
The machine shop is known for its quality.	A maara ụlọ ahịa igwe igwe maka ịdị mma ya.
She is a good girl.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwa agbọghọ.
Of course, there are a lot of same people out there.	N'ezie, enwere ọtụtụ ndị otu anụ ahụ n'ebe ahụ.

For tomorrow there will be no.	N'ihi na echi ọ gaghị adị.
But how do you do that?	Mana kedu ka isi mee nke ahụ.
Everything frightens you.	Ihe niile na-atụ gị egwu.
The idea is very simple.	Echiche a dị nnọọ mfe.
Driving is what you enjoy doing well.	Ịnya ụgbọ ala na-amasị gị ime ya nke ọma.
He asked one.	Ọ jụrụ otu.
More than that happened.	Ihe karịrị nke ahụ mere.
I can imagine.	Enwere m ike iche.
He is happier than he is when he falls in love.	Ọ na-enwe obi ụtọ karịa mgbe ọ hụrụ n'anya.
That is a really special car.	Nke ahụ bụ ezigbo ụgbọ ala pụrụ iche.
There is a story behind this.	Enwere akụkọ n'azụ nke a.
There are.	Enwere.
Never.	Ọ dịghị mgbe.

He thought they would come for dinner.	O chere na ha ga-abịa nri abalị.
That was my situation when your letter arrived.	Nke ahụ bụ ọnọdụ m mgbe akwụkwọ ozi gị rutere.
They are so beautiful, that you are so simple.	Ha mara mma nke ukwuu, na ị dị nnọọ mfe.

But you know what you want to do.	Ma ị mara ihe ị chọrọ ime.
I saw him again last night with my children.	Ahụrụ m ya ọzọ n'abalị ụnyaahụ mụ na ụmụ m.

Great, great.	Ọ dị ukwuu, ka ukwuu.

Those are your best days, my dear.	Ndị ahụ bụ ụbọchị gị kacha mma, ezigbo m.
He has a few friends.	O nwere ndị enyi ole na ole.
Often, the best thing we can do is say something.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, ihe kacha mma anyị nwere ike ime bụ ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
But that is good, of course.	Ma nke ahụ dị mma, n'ezie.
Just as you can.	Dị nnọọ ka gị onwe gị nwere ike.

However, this gift was worth it.	Otú ọ dị, onyinye a bịara n'ọnụ ahịa.

We should all do well.	Anyị niile kwesịrị ime nke ọma.
He said it would be a team effort.	O kwuru na ọ ga-abụ ike otu.
There are books, there are models.	Enwere akwụkwọ, enwere ụdị.

Our school is in the village.	Ụlọ akwụkwọ anyị dị n'ime obodo.
They are just beautiful.	Ha mara mma naanị.
It is early in the morning.	Ọ bụ onye ụtụtụ.
Singing makes your heart free.	Ịbụ abụ na-eme ka obi gị nwere onwe gị.

I'm sure they love it.	Eji m n’aka na ha hụrụ ya n’anya.
Just for the moment.	Naanị maka oge a.
He only wears a short nightgown.	Ọ bụ naanị obere uwe abalị ka o yi.

I want to think.	Achọrọ m iche echiche.
To make a positive impact on the few lives around him.	Iji mee ka mmetụta dị mma na ndụ ole na ole gbara ya gburugburu.
This plan requires a lot of money.	Atụmatụ a chọrọ nnukwu ego.
Both seem hopeless.	Ha abụọ dị ka enweghị olileanya.
It cannot go on.	Ọ nweghị ike ịga n'ihu.
He is attending an important meeting.	Ọ na-aga nzukọ dị mkpa.
Birth.	Ọmụmụ.
That was a special movie.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe nkiri pụrụ iche.
When you are in need.	Mgbe ị nọ na mkpa.
He has no intention of running.	Ọ dịghị uche ịgba ọsọ.
An awesome way.	Otu ụzọ dị egwu.
We have a daughter.	Anyị nwere nwa nwanyị.
It does not need to be fast.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ka ọ dị ngwa ngwa.
Because once live your life.	N'ihi na otu ugboro bi ndụ gị.
It went well.	Ọ gara nke ọma.
There are no women, anywhere.	Enweghị ụmụ nwanyị, ebe ọ bụla.
The point is the same rule.	Isi okwu bụ otu iwu.
Just a few days before his birthday, of course.	Naanị ụbọchị ole na ole tupu ụbọchị ọmụmụ ya, n'ezie.
None of the vegetables are on time.	Ọ dịghị nke akwụkwọ nri dị n'oge.
He walked behind the waiting tree.	Ọ gara n'azụ osisi chere.
We like to see what is going on and see where they are going.	Ọ na-amasị anyị ịhụ ihe na-aga ma hụ ebe ha na-aga.
The restaurant is full.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ ahụ juru.
Money should not be the only success.	Ego ekwesịghị ịbụ naanị ihe atụ nke ịga nke ọma.
Two years is good.	Afọ abụọ dị mma.
I hope we will not do this in the winter.	Enwere m olileanya na anyị agaghị eme nke a n'oge oyi.

Never name a character.	Ọ dịghị mgbe aha agwa.
The cause of his problems.	Ihe kpatara nsogbu ya.
I miss him.	A na m atụ uche ya.
It made men happy to see them happy.	O mere ka obi dị ụmụ nwoke ụtọ ịhụ ka ha na-enwe obi ụtọ.
He refused to talk about what had happened.	Ọ jụrụ ikwu banyere ihe merenụ.
I can tell you what to do with that.	Enwere m ike ịgwa gị ihe ị ga-eme nke ahụ.
It's impossible.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
He does not know what is expected of him.	Ọ gaghị ama ihe a tụrụ anya ya n'aka ya.
His eyes fell.	Anya ya dara.
Of course we would.	N'ezie, anyị ga-amasị ya.
I do not know how to do it.	Amaghị m ka m ga-esi mee ya.
Still, it is a good idea.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ bụ ezi echiche.
He is a lover.	Ọ bụ onye hụrụ ya n'anya.
Everyone has a chance.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ohere.
Or from the country.	Ma ọ bụ site na mba.
You do not know what you have there.	Ị maghị ihe ị nwere ebe ahụ.
I want more.	Achọrọ m karịa.
It seems weak.	Ọ dị ka adịghị ike.
It will not happen.	Ọ gaghị eme.
They need food.	Ha chọrọ nri.
Being here now.	Ịbụ ebe a ugbu a.
I will have, these days.	M ga-enwe, ụbọchị ndị a.
Although his salary was low, he was satisfied.	N’agbanyeghị na ụgwọ ọnwa ya dị obere, afọ juru ya afọ.
They did it because they themselves wanted it.	Ha mere ya n'ihi na ha onwe ha chọrọ ya.
No problem finding it there.	Enweghị nsogbu ịchọta ebe ahụ.
Of course, they have no point.	N'ezie, ha enweghị isi ihe ọ bụla.
The effects, however, are quite another.	Otú ọ dị, mmetụta ya bụ nnọọ ihe ọzọ.
They expect to do it on time.	Ha tụrụ anya ime ya n'oge.
I don't see why they should do it.	Ahụghị m ihe mere ha ga-eji mee ya.
She ate beautiful food	O riri nri mara mma
I can't really say that.	Agaghị m enwe ike ikwu nke ahụ n'ezie.
Everything will go well.	Ihe niile ga-aga nke ọma.
Not a difficult word.	Ọ bụghị okwu siri ike.
It's a bad thing.	Ọ bụ ihe na-adịghị mma.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Ọ dị ka ọ dara.
The door is still closed.	Ọnụ ụzọ ahụ ka kwụsịrị.
They can do this.	Ha nwere ike ime nke a.
Hope to see you again soon !.	Olileanya ịhụ ya ọzọ n'oge adịghị anya!.
Maybe in another movie.	Ma eleghị anya na ihe nkiri ọzọ.
Enjoy doing this with your family or friends.	Nwee obi ụtọ ime nke a na ndị ezinụlọ gị ma ọ bụ ndị enyi gị.
He hates haters.	Ọ kpọrọ ndị kpọrọ asị asị.
It was a great holiday today.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ezumike taa.
You will not do anything here.	Ị gaghị eme ihe ọ bụla ebe a.
I'd like to be here again.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịnọ ebe a ọzọ.
They are very close.	Ha dị ezigbo nso.
I think about it all the time.	M na-eche banyere ya mgbe niile.
I love it.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya.
Time is and time is not.	Oge bụ na oge abụghị.
This gift is only valid for a few days.	Onyinye a bara uru naanị ụbọchị ole na ole.
I do not know anything about it.	Amaghị m ihe ọ bụla gbasara ya.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
There is still time to act.	A ka nwere oge ime ihe.
But no one seems to know where he is.	Ma o yiri ka ọ dịghị onye ma ebe ọ nọ.
Some thought he was a fool.	Ụfọdụ chere na ọ bụ onye nzuzu.
That's what friends do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ndị enyi mere.
It is the best.	Ọ bụ ya kacha mma.
Some know this better than others.	Ụfọdụ maara nke a karịa ndị ọzọ.
It has no form.	O nweghị ụdị.
He can see the movie if he wants to.	O nwere ike ịhụ ihe nkiri ahụ ma ọ chọọ.
Land together.	Ala n'otu.
This city is known for its fertile land.	A maara obodo a maka ala na-eme nri.
More than that.	Karịrị nke ahụ.
But we can do something about it.	Ma anyị nwere ike ime ihe banyere nke a.
Such talk came up.	Okwu dị otú ahụ wee bịa.
Or at least close it.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ mee ya nso.
Now this is a problem.	Ugbu a nke a bụ nsogbu.
I am not ready for this.	Adịghị m njikere maka nke a.
Not known for its solid design.	Amaghị maka otu siri ike.
There are many restaurants nearby.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ dị nso.
It did not happen as expected.	O yighị ka ọ ga-eme dị ka a tụrụ anya ya.
But sometimes we do not see that for ourselves.	Ma mgbe ụfọdụ, anyị anaghị ahụ nke ahụ n'onwe anyị.
He saw nothing else about it.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ hụrụ banyere ya.
No one else in the house loves them.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ nọ n'ụlọ ahụ hụrụ ha n'anya.
Tell yourself that now.	Gwa onwe gị ihe ahụ ugbu a.
Do the work.	Mee ọrụ ahụ.
Well, that's it.	Ọ dị mma, ọ bụ ya.
Someone she knows.	Onye ọ maara.
No one told him he was black.	Ọ dịghị onye gwara ya na ọ bụ nwa ojii.
This is our only job.	Nke a bụ naanị ọrụ anyị.
Whatever your plans, we won’t have enough time tonight.	Ihe ọ bụla ị na-eme atụmatụ, anyị agaghị enwe oge zuru oke n'abalị a.
Of course not.	N'ezie, o kwesịghị ịdị otú ahụ.
If that is something you can call it.	Ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ bụ ihe ị nwere ike ịkpọ ya.
That will not happen today.	Nke ahụ agaghị eme taa.
The language of the land.	Asụsụ ala ahụ.
There is something else recently.	Enwere ihe ọzọ na nso nso a.
He has two hands in his mouth.	O nwere aka abụọ n'ọnụ ya.
Mary, where they were born.	Mary, ebe a mụrụ ha.
I feel it has nothing to do with it, to this day.	Enwere m mmetụta ọ nweghị ihe ọ bụla maka ya, ruo taa.
It is far from being that.	Ọ dị anya ịbụ nke ahụ.
Of course, from ancient times to the present.	N'ezie, site n'oge ochie ruo ugbu a.
That is why they are not with you.	Ọ bụ ya mere o nwere ike ịbụ na ha na gị anọghị ebe ahụ.
Sit still.	Nọdụ ala nke ukwuu.
And a little expensive.	Na ntakịrị ọnụ.
I want to go to dinner.	Achọrọ m ịga na nri.
I love it.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya.
That is the way life should be.	Otú ahụ ka ndụ kwesịrị ịdị.
My town is small.	Obodo m dị obere.
His words came as a surprise to me.	Okwu ya tụrụ n'anya nke mbụ.
Still pretty simple.	Ka mara mma mfe.
But this game is tough.	Mana egwuregwu a siri ike.
There are girls, many of them.	E nwere ụmụ agbọghọ, ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
You speak fast.	Ị na-ekwu ngwa ngwa.
New weather along the way.	Ihu igwe ọhụrụ n'ụzọ.
The last ones hate people for fighting spirits.	Ndị nke ikpeazụ kpọrọ ndị mmadụ mmụọ ọgụ asị.
Today is my winter day.	Taa bụ ụbọchị oyi m.
Tears welled up.	Anya gbara mmiri.
That's them, in the picture.	Nke ahụ bụ ha, na foto.
Whatever he wanted, well, he did not get it.	Ihe ọ bụla ọ chọrọ, nke ọma, ahụghị ya.
But it is very new.	Ma ọ bụ nnọọ ihe ọhụrụ.
See what they are doing.	Hụ ihe ha na-eme.
That made the body worse.	Nke ahụ mere ka ahụ́ ka njọ.
Fact.	Eziokwu.
There will be action to be taken.	A ga-enwe ihe a ga-eme.
Music is one of his favorites.	Ngwa egwu bụ otu n'ime mmasị ya.
He is not a man.	Ọ bụghị mmadụ.
But now you want to go home.	Ma ugbu a, ịchọrọ ịla n'ụlọ.
Working with new cars for that.	Na-arụ ọrụ na ụgbọala ọhụrụ maka nke ahụ.
She does not mind.	Ọ chọghị ịma.
On the one hand, it is ubiquitous.	N'otu aka, ọ bụ ebe niile.
We do not expect spirits.	Anyị anaghị atụ anya mmụọ.
Others think it's a new type of weapon.	Ndị ọzọ chere na ọ bụ ụdị ngwa ọgụ ọhụrụ.
He said he was very happy to see you.	O kwuru na obi dị ya ụtọ nke ukwuu ịhụ gị.
What is me.	Gịnị bụ m.
I know him for sure.	Amaara m ya n'ezie.
This seems to be happening only in some places.	Nke a dị ka ọ na-eme naanị n'ebe ụfọdụ.
Maybe they’ll come around.	Ma eleghị anya, ha ga-abịa gburugburu.
It is difficult to help staff.	O siri ike inye ndị ọrụ aka.
Each one is good.	Nke ọ bụla dị mma.
What a pity!	Kedu ụdị ihe nwute bụ nke a!
He’s a good customer, of course.	Ọ bụ ezigbo onye ahịa, n'ezie.
I do not think this is true.	Echeghị m na nke a bụ eziokwu.
There is no hard study.	Enweghị ọmụmụ ihe siri ike.
And a lot of fun.	Na ọtụtụ ihe ọchị.
You are not to blame for them.	Ọ bụghị gị kpatara ha.
I have no idea about it.	Enweghị m isi maka ya.
There are many of them nowadays.	Enwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha oge a.
By that, it’s a good movie.	Site na nke ahụ, ọ bụ ihe nkiri dị mma.
They want me, you see.	Ha chọrọ m, ị hụrụ.
But you can not use that language again.	Mana ị nweghị ike iji asụsụ ahụ ọzọ.
He really doesn't want to see me.	N’ezie, ọ chọghị ịhụ m n’ezie.
You do not deserve it.	I kwesịghị ya.
Many tourists come here every year.	Ọtụtụ ndị njem na-abịa ebe a kwa afọ.
They can't believe their eyes.	Ha enweghị ike ikweta anya ha.
I do not understand why you want to do this.	Aghọtaghị m ihe mere i ji chọọ ime nke a.
I like driving.	Ọ na-amasị m ịnya ụgbọ ala.
He said nothing about this when we first entered.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla o kwuru banyere nke a mgbe mbụ anyị banyere.
They have breakfast.	Ha na-eri nri ụtụtụ.
I have been active for the past three days.	Anọ m na-eme ihe kemgbe ụbọchị atọ gara aga.
I can't do anything about it.	Enweghị m ike ime ihe ọ bụla gbasara ya.
This is what you came for.	Nke a bụ ihe ị bịara.
His parents hated him.	Ndị mụrụ ya kpọrọ ya asị.
I have no land.	Enweghị m ala.
It makes me really happy.	Ọ na-eme m ezigbo obi ụtọ.
It is all that is required.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe a chọrọ.
We will go to work tomorrow.	Anyị ga-aga ọrụ echi.
There are four main types of trees.	E nwere ụdị osisi anọ bụ́ isi.
Eyes looked around.	Anya lere anya gburugburu.
I want to go on my own.	Achọrọ m ịga na mmetụta nke onwe m.
They may not like the way they look.	Ha nwere ike ọ gaghị amasị otú ha si dị.
No big problem.	Enweghị nnukwu nsogbu.
As it should.	Dị ka ọ kwesịrị ịdị.
I would like to help others.	Ọ ga-amasị m inyere ndị ọzọ aka.
It is a message.	Ọ bụ ozi.
I do not know how he did it.	Amaghị m ka o si mee ya.
For us this is true in two ways.	Maka anyị nke a bụ eziokwu n'ụzọ abụọ.
He looked about twenty.	Ọ lere anya ihe dị ka iri abụọ.
It's too long.	Ọ dị anya ogologo.
I really like it.	Ọ masịrị m n'ezie.
Of course, the truth is that nothing works for everyone.	N'ezie, eziokwu bụ na ọ dịghị ihe na-arụ ọrụ maka onye ọ bụla.
Most of all, he is my friend.	Nke ka nke, ọ bụ enyi m.
No, it is not there.	Mba, ọ bụghị ebe ahụ.
But he was in the back of the room.	Ma ọ nọ n'azụ ime ụlọ.
I know each dog by name.	Amaara m nkịta ọ bụla aha.
There is no reason for it.	Enweghị ihe kpatara ya.
Or, the car could be a problem.	Ma ọ bụ, ụgbọ ala nwere ike ịbụ nsogbu.
Suddenly, the door slammed shut.	Na mberede, ọnụ ụzọ ahụ dara.
Everything is a game.	Ihe niile bụ egwuregwu.
It sounds like fear.	Ọ dị ka ụjọ.
That really is.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ezie.
I think a man should make his own opinion.	Echere m na nwoke kwesịrị ime echiche nke ya.
He gave his orders.	O nyere iwu ya.
However, it is difficult.	Otú ọ dị, ọ siri ike.
It doesn’t seem like a job.	Ọ naghị adị ka ọrụ.
People should take advantage of that opportunity.	Ndị mmadụ kwesịrị iji ohere ahụ mee ihe.
But they are very important to me.	Ma ha dị m ezigbo mkpa.
But I was the only one in the room with her.	Ma, e nwere naanị mụ na ya n’ime ụlọ ahụ.
It seems like everyone is thinking about it right now.	Ọ dị ka onye ọ bụla na-eche banyere ya ugbu a.
I was in a panic.	Anọ m n'ihe egwu.
I think it is.	Echere m na ọ bụ ya.
His father asked.	Nna ya jụrụ ya.
She wants a baby.	Ọ chọrọ nwa.
He loves this job.	Ọ hụrụ ọrụ a n'anya.
Beautiful place.	Ebe mara mma mara mma.
As they would have done it or it would not have been a big deal.	Dị ka ha gaara eme ya ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị nnukwu ihe.
I liked the idea.	Echiche ahụ masịrị m.
You know how they go.	Ị ma ka ha si aga.
We did it.	Anyị mere ya.
Believe me, you are not unique.	Kwere m, ị bụghị ihe pụrụ iche.
Not more than two days.	Ọ bụghị ihe karịrị ụbọchị abụọ.
The dog is in the head.	Nkịta nọ n'isi.
But that is not good.	Ma nke ahụ adịghị mma.
Glad we arrived right away.	Obi ụtọ na anyị rutere ozugbo.
However, he did not want to say anything.	Otú ọ dị, ọ chọghị ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
It was almost a chore.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ọrụ.
He likes work.	Ọrụ na-amasị ya.
They only have eyes for each other.	Ha nwere naanị anya maka ibe ha.
You are reading this carefully.	Ị na-agụ nke a nke ọma.
It is better to tell them anything.	Ọ ka mma ịgwa ha ihe ọ bụla.
Some are beautiful, some are beautiful.	Ụfọdụ mara mma, ụfọdụ mara mma.
This problem has many causes.	Nsogbu a nwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
These girls are impossible.	Ụmụ agbọghọ ndị a agaghị ekwe omume.
But it never belonged to me.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bụ nke m.
This is important for a few things.	Nke a dị mkpa maka ihe ole na ole.
Whatever they may say, you know who you are.	Ihe ọ bụla ha nwere ike ikwu, ị maara onye ị bụ.
A lot has happened today.	Ọtụtụ ihe mere taa.
The same thing is happening with other companies.	Otu ihe ahụ na-eme na ụlọ ọrụ ndị ọzọ.
They are one.	Ha bụ otu.
Her father is ill.	Nna ya dara ọrịa.
Not the best marketing plan.	Ọ bụghị atụmatụ ahịa kacha mma.
This makes sense.	Nke a nwere ezi uche.
He knew it would happen.	Ọ maara na ọ ga-eme.
The idea is here.	Echiche dị ebe a.
They can not do that.	Ha enweghị ike ime otú ahụ.
That would be a good thing to do.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ihe dị mma ime.
We started talking.	Anyị malitere ikwu okwu.
I am happy with it.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ya.
He said he did not know anything about it.	O kwuru na ya amaghị ihe ọ bụla gbasara ya.
It seems obvious and logical.	Ọ dị ka ihe doro anya na ezi uche.
Both brother and sister and brother and wife.	Ma nwanne na nwanne ma nwoke na nwunye.
He just did not want to.	Ọ chọghị nnọọ.
Very good with photos.	Ezigbo mma na foto.
I stopped using it again.	M kwụsịrị iji ya ọzọ.
I was on a boat.	Anọ m n'otu ụgbọ mmiri.
Or a little wine.	Ma ọ bụ obere mmanya.
He should not bother her.	O kwesịghị inye ya nsogbu.

Something surprised me that it was not well.	Ọ nwere ihe tụrụ m n'anya na ọ bụghị nke ọma.

He will not die.	Ọ gaghị anwụ.
This is not fun.	Nke a abụghị ihe na-atọ ụtọ.

He was obviously looking for me.	O doro anya na ọ na-achọ m.
Going home now is not possible.	Ịla n'ụlọ ugbu a agaghị ekwe omume.
That may be true.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ eziokwu.
Every customer, and every service, is unique.	Onye ahịa ọ bụla, na ọrụ ọ bụla, pụrụ iche.
You started all this.	Ị malitere ihe a niile.

He loved this boat.	Ọ hụrụ ụgbọ mmiri a n'anya.
Things, who is in it.	Ihe, onye nọ ya na ya.
This is understood.	A ghọtara nke a.
There are two possible reasons for this.	Enwere ihe abụọ nwere ike ime nke a.
How do we make our car more efficient?	Kedu otu anyị si eme ka ụgbọ ala anyị na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma?
Then my face.	Mgbe ahụ ihu m.
However, there is no happiness.	Otú ọ dị, obi ụtọ adịghị.

We will go on the road, but only for an hour or so.	Anyị ga-aga n'ụzọ, mana naanị otu elekere ma ọ bụ karịa.
For his people.	Maka ndị ya.
She will be one of his girls.	Ọ ga-abụ otu n'ime ụmụ agbọghọ ya.
The center of this story is its character.	Isi nke akụkọ a bụ agwa ya.
He knows nothing about this.	O nweghị ihe ọ maghị gbasara nke a.
That is the only difference.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị ihe dị iche.
Winter is a difficult time for many people.	Oge oyi bụ oge siri ike nye ọtụtụ mmadụ.
They are events to do and special.	Ha bụ ihe omume ime na pụrụ iche.
Keep the game warm.	Mee ka egwuregwu ahụ dị ọkụ.

Obviously it goes all out or anything.	O doro anya na ọ na-aga ihe niile ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
They were interested at first.	Ha nwere mmasị na mbụ.
Well, now let's move on to the important part.	Ọ dị mma, ugbu a gaa n'akụkụ dị mkpa.
Of course, you can go out and buy one.	N'ezie, ị nwere ike ịpụ zụta otu.
I do not understand what it could be.	Aghọtaghị m ihe ọ nwere ike ịbụ.
No one can tell me what is happening to me.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ịgwa m ihe na-eme m.
That is something that no one seems to understand.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ dị ka ọ nweghị onye ghọtara.
That's not it.	Nke ahụ abụghị ya.
So do not enter.	Ya mere, adịghị banyere.
They will have each other.	Ha ga-enwe ibe ha.
It is more than you say.	Ọ karịrị ihe ị na-ekwu.
He is happy to see me.	Obi dị ya ụtọ ịhụ m.
They came in the morning.	Ha bịara n’ụtụtụ.

But it's not different.	Ma ọ bụghị iche.
A short wait.	Obere oge echere.
Or the way everyone else thinks.	Ma ọ bụ otú onye ọ bụla ọzọ chere.
No more talk about it.	Enweghị okwu ọzọ gbasara ya.
We never talked about it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị kwuru banyere ya.
The car is their way of life.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ bụ ụzọ ndụ ha.
Certainly not a bad idea.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị echiche ọjọọ.
No one talked about them.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru okwu banyere ha.
His work is very beautiful.	Ọrụ ya mara mma nke ukwuu.
They let you know.	Ha mere ka ị mara.
So we will do the same.	Ya mere, anyị ga-eme otu ihe ahụ.
I will have a better plan then.	M ga-enwe atụmatụ ka mma mgbe ahụ.
I'm sure it's the only one that exists.	Eji m n'aka na ọ bụ naanị ya dị adị.
So it can be done.	Ya mere enwere ike ime ya.
The family went to the door. 	Ezinụlọ ahụ gara n'ọnụ ụzọ. 
You will be faster.	Ị ga-adị ngwa ngwa.
Of course he would need permission not to do it.	N'ezie ọ ga-achọ ikike ka ọ ghara ime ya.
She was left to wonder who she was.	A hapụrụ ya ka ọ na-eche onye ọ bụ.
I love my friends, my brother.	Ahụrụ m ndị enyi m n'anya, nwanne m nwoke.

At the time, he did not care.	N'oge ahụ, ọ chọghị ịma.
Everyone, sit down.	Onye ọ bụla, nọrọ ọdụ.

He came immediately.	Ọ bịara ozugbo.
We can only wait to see.	Anyị nwere ike chere naanị hụ.

The only thing he heard others talk about.	Naanị ihe ọ nụrụ ka ndị ọzọ na-ekwu banyere ya.

He was only about ten years old.	Ọ dị naanị ihe dị ka afọ iri.

However, there will be some new features.	Otú ọ dị, a ga-enwe ụfọdụ atụmatụ ọhụrụ.

Just another threat.	Naanị ihe egwu ọzọ.

Meanwhile, he was scared.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, ụjọ nọ na-atụ ya.
He is not a man.	Ọ bụghị mmadụ.

No doubt they loved it.	O doro anya na ha hụrụ n'anya.

This is a funny interview, if a little stupid.	Nke a bụ ajụjụ ọnụ na-atọ ọchị, ma ọ bụrụ na ọ dị ntakịrị nzuzu.
Men do not have to do this.	Ọ bụghị iwu ka ụmụ nwoke kwesịrị ime otú ahụ.

He doesn't like the word.	Okwu ahụ anaghị amasị ya.

Just wait and see where you arrive.	Naanị chere ka ị hụ ebe ị rutere.
So we are in good hands.	Ya mere, anyị nọ na ezigbo aka.

My sister is a story of her own success.	Nwanne m nwanyị bụ akụkọ ihe ịga nke ọma nke ya.

The police are looking for him.	Ndị uwe ojii na-achọ ya.

But hopefully it's not stupid either.	Ma na-atụ anya na ọ bụghị nzuzu ma.

Once he saw it, he knew it was important.	Ozugbo ọ hụrụ ya, ọ maara na ọ dị mkpa.
That is what some people did.	Otú ahụ ka ụfọdụ ndị mere.
So he started his vacation.	Ya mere, ọ malitere ezumike ya.
It is the best place to be.	Ọ bụ ebe kacha mma ịnọ.
But not so much.	Ma ọ bụghị nke ukwuu.

No matter how different it is.	N'agbanyeghị otú o si dị iche.

He asked the waiter for a snack.	Ọ jụrụ onye na-eri nri maka nri nri.
This is not a good thing, this should not be done.	Nke a abụghị ihe dị mma, nke a ekwesịghị ime.
There is no other reason.	O nweghị ihe ọzọ kpatara ya.

Violence broke out.	Ihe ike malitere.

But they don't want to think about that.	Ma ha achọghị iche echiche banyere nke ahụ.
They had no shoes most of the time.	Ha enweghị akpụkpọ ụkwụ ọtụtụ oge.

The city is known for its high standard of living.	Obodo mara maka ọnọdụ ndụ ya dị elu.
It was a foolish day.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị nzuzu.
It’s like a movie trailer.	Ọ dị ka ihe nkiri ihe nkiri.

We are in a place where it is easy to drive to different places of interest.	Anyị nọ n'ebe dị mfe ịnya ụgbọ ala nke ebe mmasị dị iche iche.
It was a wonderful, unhappy day.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị dị egwu, nke enweghị obi ụtọ.
The fact that he did it is not a story.	Eziokwu ahụ bụ na o mere abụghị akụkọ.
Some things happen.	Ụfọdụ ihe na-eme.

She said she wanted to see him again and again.	O kwuru na ya chọrọ ịhụ ya ugboro ugboro.
There is nothing that we can do.	O nweghị ihe anyị nwere ike ime.
It could be then or last night.	O nwere ike ịbụ mgbe ahụ ma ọ bụ n'abalị gara aga.
We don't want problems.	Anyị achọghị nsogbu.
For better or worse.	Maka mma ma ọ bụ njọ.

I'm glad I was invited to this party.	Obi dị m ụtọ na a kpọrọ m oriri a.

You do not know.	Ị maghị.
It’s that time of next year.	Ọ bụ oge ahụ nke afọ ọzọ.
From another place.	Site n'ebe ọzọ.
For some this is the destination.	Maka ụfọdụ ebe a bụ ebe ha na-aga.
We will do it.	Anyị ga-eme ya.
No one speaks.	Ọ dịghị onye na-ekwu okwu.
Of course without that ability no other human being could exist.	N'ezie na-enweghị ikike ahụ ọ nweghị ikike mmadụ ọzọ nwere ike ịdị.
It tasted good and warm.	Ọ nụrụ ụtọ na ọkụ.
What is happening today is important.	Ihe a na-eme taa dị mkpa.
His anger did well.	Iwe ya mere ya nke ọma.
Of course in some countries they are in second place.	N'ezie na mba ụfọdụ ha bụ ebe nke abụọ.
I know this will not happen now but the idea is there.	Ama m na nke a agaghị eme ugbu a mana echiche dị ebe ahụ.
Until then.	Ruo ya.
And then these are some other things.	Na mgbe ahụ, ndị a bụ ndị ọzọ dị iche iche.
The fire spread rapidly inside the boat.	Ọkụ ahụ gbasara ngwa ngwa n'ime ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
There could be several reasons for that.	Enwere ike inwe ọtụtụ ihe kpatara nke ahụ.
You can't be here without it.	Ị nweghị ike ịnọ ebe a na-enweghị ya.
It eats away at his face.	Ọ na-eri ihu ya.
I shared my thoughts.	Agwara m echiche m.

There is so much to see!	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe ịhụ!
I hope relatives will come to the party.	Enwere m olileanya na ndị ikwu ga-abịa oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
It's hard to value you.	O siri ike iji gị kpọrọ ihe.
We went to work.	Anyị gara ọrụ.
A very handsome man.	Nwoke mara ezigbo mma.
He can talk to anyone.	O nwere ike ịgwa onye ọ bụla okwu.

Humanity is of paramount importance.	Ọmụmụ mmadụ bara uru dị oke mkpa.
However, there is fire.	Otú ọ dị, ọkụ dị.
Fast and furious.	Ngwa ngwa na iwe.
But he may know.	Ma o nwere ike ịma.
Now suppose you are eating it.	Ugbu a were ya na ị na-eri ya.
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?	Ọ bụ ụbọchị mara mma, ọ́ bụghị ya?
Please let us know.	Biko mee ka anyị mara.

Not a word from you.	Ọ bụghị otu okwu si gị.
Certainly not every one of their houses.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị ụlọ ha ọ bụla.
Not for my sake.	Ọ bụghị n'ihi m.
Two beds, please.	Akwa abụọ, biko.
Then it will be a legal question.	Mgbe ahụ ọ ga-abụ ajụjụ gbasara iwu.
I can see many of them.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
I can talk to him very well now.	Enwere m ike ịgwa ya okwu nke ọma ugbu a.
He took a moment on his own.	O were otu oge n'onwe ya.
It was made by people.	E ji ndị mmadụ mee ya.
This does not work though.	Nke a anaghị arụ ọrụ n'agbanyeghị.
And always.	Na mgbe niile.
Both are still ongoing.	Ha abụọ ka na-aga n'ihu.
Really thought and loved.	N'ezie chere na hụrụ.
There is no space in the cold room for all the meat.	Enweghị ohere n'ime ụlọ oyi maka anụ ahụ niile.
That is up to him.	Nke ahụ dị n'aka ya.
Another meat is not very good.	Ọzọ anụ adịghị mma nke ukwuu.
Every man is important.	Nwoke ọ bụla dị mkpa.
Not like tears, but tears.	Ọ bụghị dị ka anya mmiri, ma akwa ákwá.
The journey was long and arduous.	Njem ahụ dị ogologo na nke siri ike.
He is the one who left.	Ọ bụ ya hapụrụ.

He played a lot of great games when his teammates wanted them.	O mere ọtụtụ nnukwu egwuregwu mgbe ndị otu ya chọrọ ha.
It’s just, well, anything else about the game.	Ọ bụ naanị, nke ọma, ihe ọ bụla ọzọ gbasara egwuregwu ahụ.
It made us happy.	O mere ka obi dị anyị mma.
Someone you can tell easily.	Onye ị nwere ike ịgwa ya n'ụzọ dị mfe.
I know a few people who have broken the habit on their own.	Amaara m mmadụ ole na ole ka ha ji aka ha kwụsị omume ahụ.
But they refused.	Ma ha jụrụ.
But that is not important here.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị ihe dị mkpa ebe a.
Where is the best place to drive?	Ebee ka ebe dị mma ịnya ụgbọ ala?
But that makes the story even bigger.	Ma nke ahụ na-eme ka akụkọ ahụ bụrụ akụkọ ka ukwuu.
Such a statement is old, of course.	Okwu dị otú ahụ bụ ihe ochie, n'ezie.
I have nothing more to do than that.	Enweghị m ihe ọ bụla chọrọ karịa nke ahụ.
This man knows the past.	Nwoke a maara ihe gara aga.
He is doing it now.	Ọ na-eme ya ugbu a.
My children are real.	Ụmụ m dị adị.
No one saw it.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya.
Kids have a new teacher.	Ụmụaka nwere onye nkuzi ọhụrụ.
Never again.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọzọ.
A house is on fire.	Otu ụlọ gbara ọkụ.
No police officer is nearby.	Ọ dịghị onye uwe ojii nọ nso.
Tears welled up in her eyes.	Anya mmiri na-agba ya n'anya.
I am good at that.	Adị m mma na nke ahụ.
I have this feeling that he is happy.	Enwere m mmetụta a na ọ nwere obi ụtọ.
I saw that today.	Ahụrụ m nke ahụ taa.
He has many friends.	O nwere ọtụtụ ndị enyi.
This has been the case since we were children.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị kemgbe anyị bụ ụmụaka.
Soon, the debt of a starving community was paid off.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, a kwụsịrị ụgwọ nke obodo agụụ na-agụ.
I want to run.	Achọrọ m ịgba ọsọ.
As I was a new boss.	Dị ka m bụ onye isi ọhụrụ.
They are not popular.	Ha abụghị ndị a ma ama.
But he liked it there.	Mana ọ masịrị ya ebe ahụ.
Most of us, the better.	Ọtụtụ n'ime anyị, ka mma.
We say that the effect is small.	Anyị na-ekwu na mmetụta dị ntakịrị.
You are much higher than that.	Ị dị oke elu karịa nke ahụ.
Word of mouth continues.	Okwu okwu na-aga n'ihu.
In this way.	N'ụzọ dị otu a.
You know about my good parents.	Ị maara banyere ezigbo nne na nna m.
Another man is telling the truth.	Nwoke ọzọ na-ekwu eziokwu.
Few people work there.	Mmadụ ole na ole na-arụ ọrụ n'ebe ahụ.
They said he was alone.	Ha kwuru na ọ nọ naanị ya.
Not his place.	Ọ bụghị ebe ya.
One boat capsized, and two fishermen drowned.	Otu ụgbọ mmiri riri, mmiri riri ndị ọkụ azụ abụọ.
He loves his people very much.	Ọ hụrụ ndị ya n’anya nke ukwuu.
All other patients were healthy and alive.	Ndị ọrịa ndị ọzọ niile dị mma ma dị ndụ.
But the situation is different.	Ma ọnọdụ ahụ dị iche.
There will be no such thing as words or books or people.	A gaghị enwe ihe dị ka okwu ma ọ bụ akwụkwọ ma ọ bụ ndị mmadụ.
Then there are the likes of my two husbands.	Mgbe ahụ, e nwere ndị na-amasị di m abụọ.
What it has is a lot of fun.	Ihe ọ nwere bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
The police are doing well.	Ndị uwe ojii na-eme nke ọma.
I have never been scared in my life.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m tụrụ egwu na ndụ m.
She cares about her children.	O chere banyere ụmụ ya.
Not a good life.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo ndụ.
Their laughter turned out to be true.	Ihe ọchị ha mechara bụrụ eziokwu.
He looked at it carefully.	O lere ya anya nke ọma.
Any kind of work.	Ụdị ọrụ ọ bụla.
He promised to do it.	O kwere nkwa na ya ga-eme ya.
Then there are the two cases.	Mgbe ahụ, enwere ikpe abụọ.
I am not on drugs.	Adịghị m ọgwụ ike.
But you are still the second.	Ma ị ka bụ nke abụọ.
By themselves, they would be fine.	N'onwe ha, ha ga-adị mma.
In the long run.	Na ogologo oge.
Same thing as school.	Otu ihe ahụ dị ka ụlọ akwụkwọ.
Some run schools.	Ụfọdụ na-agba ụlọ akwụkwọ.
We need to find it.	Anyị kwesịrị ịchọta ya.
Sometimes for a few hours.	Mgbe ụfọdụ maka awa ole na ole.
His mother and children are playful.	Nne ya na ụmụ ya bụ egwuregwu.

No matter how much they loved them.	N'agbanyeghị otú ha si hụ ha n'anya.
He understood her feelings.	Ọ ghọtara mmetụta ya n'ebe ọ nọ.

You are a good person.	Ị bụ ezigbo mmadụ.

Kind of like a game.	Ụdị dị ka egwuregwu.

It seemed like a real challenge why we did it.	Ọ dị ka ezigbo ihe ịma aka ya mere anyị mere ya.

He plunged into the water.	Ọ banyere n'ime mmiri.
Wise.	Onye ma ihe.
Give him your best.	Nye ya ihe kacha mma gị.
That's good for now.	Nke ahụ dị mma maka ugbu a.
The company itself is as old as the building.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ n'onwe ya dị ochie dị ka ụlọ ahụ.
We left him.	Anyị si n'ebe ọ nọ pụọ.
I think he was right about that.	Echere m na o kwuru eziokwu banyere nke ahụ.
It does not go that way.	Ọ naghị aga otu ahụ.
She begins to cry.	Ọ malitere ibe ákwá.
Bad game.	Egwuregwu na-adịghị mma.
I hope this information will help you.	Enwere m olileanya na ozi a ga-enyere gị aka.
They have no plans.	Ha enweghị atụmatụ.
People were angry.	Ndị mmadụ were iwe.
It is run around here.	A na-agba ya gburugburu ebe a.
The size of the items doesn’t do anything.	Oke nke ihe ndị ahụ anaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.

These conditions are not very serious, but they do not feel good.	Ọnọdụ ndị a adịghị oke oke, mana ahụ adịghị ha mma.

It is important that the water is not too hot.	Ọ dị mkpa na mmiri ahụ adịghị ọkụ nke ukwuu.

It is a very beautiful one.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu otu.

Does he know well?	Ọ maara nke ọma?
What works for you, works for you.	Ihe na-arụ ọrụ maka gị, na-arụ ọrụ maka gị.
It made me feel good that someone was interested.	O mere ka obi dị m mma na mmadụ nwere mmasị.

At least that is what they said.	Ma ọ́ dịghị ihe ọzọ, nke ahụ bụ ihe ha kwuru.
Just my name.	Naanị aha m.
Is it dangerous.	Ọ dị egwu.
The house collapsed.	Ụlọ ahụ dara.
That is bad news.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ọjọọ.
They have nothing more than a little friend.	Ha enweghị ihe ọ bụla karịa ntakịrị enyi.
I feel this way.	Enwere m mmetụta nke a.
It should be a wonderful feast.	O kwesịrị ịbụ oriri na-atụ n'anya.
Then you can go out.	Mgbe ahụ ị nwere ike ịpụ.
But it is not the same as eating each other.	Ma ọ bụghị otu ihe ahụ ka iri ibe ya.
But it is for some reason.	Ma ọ bụ ụfọdụ ihe kpatara ya.
I will never do it again.	Agaghị m eme ya ọzọ.
This city is a lot of work.	Obodo a bụ ọtụtụ ọrụ.
For good reason.	Maka ezi ihe kpatara ya.
I do not want.	Achọghị m.
But of course, that is not the job.	Mana n'ezie, nke ahụ abụghị ọrụ.
Nothing else can be done.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ a ga-eme.
That's it.	Ọ bụ ya.
Everything is possible.	Ihe niile kwere omume.
It seems to be kind.	Ọ dị ka ọ bụ ụdị.
Of course, my girlfriend has a mouth on it.	N'ezie, nwa agbọghọ m nwere ọnụ na ya.
She said she was happy.	O kwuru na obi dị ya ụtọ.
Be consistent.	Bụrụ onye na-eme ihe mgbe niile.
The city does not seem to be far from here.	O yighị ka obodo nwere ike ịdị anya ebe a.
But the ground is still here.	Mana ala ka dị ebe a.
His acting career was an immediate success.	Ọrụ ihe nkiri ya bụ ihe ịga nke ọma ozugbo.
They will go a long way.	Ha ga-aga ogologo na anya.
This happens whenever you run out of time.	Nke a na-eme mgbe ọ bụla ị mechara oge.
Some do little.	Ụfọdụ na-eme ntakịrị.
You should not talk about new opportunities and new challenges.	I kwesịghị ikwu maka ohere ọhụrụ na ihe ịma aka ọhụrụ.
They suggested a study.	Ha tụrụ aro ọmụmụ ihe.
They should be proud of their game.	Ha kwesịrị inwe obi ụtọ maka egwuregwu ha gbara.
What a difficult path ahead.	Kedu ụzọ siri ike dị n'ihu.
It's like old.	Ọ dị ka ochie.
I am not different.	Adịghị m iche.
This effect can have a profound effect on weight.	Mmetụta a nwere ike inwe mmetụta dị ukwuu na ibu ibu.
We are residents.	Anyị bụ ndị bi.
We saw everything about the building and its location.	Anyị hụrụ ihe niile gbasara ụlọ ahụ na ebe ọ nọ.
Basically because it's good to play.	Isi n'ihi na ọ dị mma igwu egwu.
She tries to be nice.	Ọ na-agbalị ịdị mma.
They can be.	Ha nwere ike ịbụ.
From there you can invite your friends.	Site n'ebe ahụ ị nwere ike ịkpọ ndị enyi gị.
His power is unique.	Ike ya pụrụ iche.
Where is your grandfather now?	Ebee ka nna nna gị nọ ugbu a?
I think he has.	Echere m na o nwere.
Okay, but there are a few problems.	Ọ dị mma, mana enwere nsogbu ole na ole.
This woman is a celebrity.	Nwanyị a bụ onye ama ama.
Some were terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ ụfọdụ.
I need help.	Achọrọ m enyemaka.
I have two good people.	Enwere m ezigbo mmadụ abụọ.
However, let us eat.	Otú ọ dị, ka anyị rie.
You probably know him, since you both go to the same school.	O nwere ike ịbụ na ị ma ya ebe ọ bụ na unu abụọ na-aga otu ụlọ akwụkwọ.
In the first year, the price was high.	N'afọ mbụ, ọnụ ahịa dị elu.
He invited us over for dinner.	Ọ kpọrọ anyị ka anyị bịa rie nri abalị n’ụlọ ya.
I should know that they are friends.	M kwesịrị ịma na ha bụ enyi.
But they told us so well.	Ma ha gwara anyị nke ọma.
She said they had only two children.	O kwuru na ha nwere naanị ụmụ abụọ.
I am running fast.	Ana m agba ọsọ ọsọ.
I arrived early for the flight.	M rutere n'oge maka ụgbọ elu.
Wait, it's me.	Chere, ọ bụ m.
I was happy with the music at the same time.	Enwere m obi ụtọ na egwu n'otu oge ahụ.
Thanks for the kind words.	Daalụ maka okwu ọma.
If you want to be.	Ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ ịbụ.
His friends soon arrived.	Ndị enyi ya rutere n'oge na-adịghị anya.
We do not really know.	Anyị amaghị n'ezie.
If so, they are likely to be awesome next year.	Ọ bụrụ otú ahụ, ọ ga-abụ na ha ga-adị egwu n'afọ ọzọ.
Tell us the story.	Gwa anyị akụkọ ahụ.
I do not expect anyone to think like me.	Anaghị m atụ anya ka onye ọ bụla na-eche ka m.
He will do it at home.	Ọ ga-eme ya n'ụlọ.
He left the building immediately.	Ọ hapụrụ ụlọ ahụ ozugbo.
But that was my priority.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe kacha m mkpa.
This restaurant has the latest fish.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ a nwere azụ kacha ọhụrụ.
He does not like the money.	Ego ahụ anaghị adị ya mma n'aka.
For me, there are no friends.	Maka m, enweghị ndị enyi.
Not small if.	Ọ bụghị obere ma ọ bụrụ.
I spoke to them.	Agwara m ha okwu.
We will only do the first case.	Anyị ga-eme naanị ikpe mbụ.
He was found by police.	Ndị uwe ojii nwetara ya.
It seems a little off.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị ntakịrị.
Everything about you is new.	Ihe niile dị na gị bụ ihe ọhụrụ.
Now it is very low.	Ugbu a ọ dị oke ala.
But it is not really that simple.	Ma, ọ bụghị n'ezie otú ahụ dị mfe.
I know where he is all the time.	Amaara m ebe ọ nọ oge niile.
This can happen.	Nke a nwere ike ime ya.
But that is old.	Mana nke ahụ bụ nke ochie.
He never told me who.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ gwara m onye.
The whole community knew they were there.	Ndị obodo niile maara na ha nọ ebe ahụ.
He fell to the ground where he had seen him before.	Ọ dara n'akụkụ ebe ọ hụrụ ya na mbụ.
You will want it but it is there.	Ị ga-achọ ya mana ọ dị ebe ahụ.
The idea was the same as my previous event.	Echiche ahụ bụ otu ihe omume m gara aga.
He surrounds us.	Ọ gbara anyị gburugburu.
It has nothing to do with this case.	Ọ nweghị ihe gbasara ikpe a.
She is a very beautiful woman.	Ọ bụ nwanyị mara mma nke ukwuu.
The mayor is a wise man.	Onye isi obodo bụ nwoke nwere uche.
Not that he can have.	Ọ bụghị na o nwere ike inwe.
This will be a book for years.	Nke a ga-abụ akwụkwọ maka afọ.
But he did not want to.	Ma ọ chọghị.
And not like this.	Ma ọ bụghị dị ka nke a.
That is not the law.	Nke ahụ abụghị iwu.
One price is low.	Otu ọnụ ala dị ala.
He needed to see the truth.	Ọ dị ya mkpa ịhụ eziokwu.
I am confident that we will do well.	Obi siri m ike na anyị ga-eme nke ọma.
Communities can get different types of funding.	Ndị obodo nwere ike nweta ụdị ego dị iche iche.
They are small.	Ihe dị obere ha.
Therefore, a lot of time and work is required.	Ya mere, a chọrọ ọtụtụ oge na ọrụ.
It's a beautiful place.	Ọ bụ ebe mara mma.
Her mother's eyes widened.	Anya nne ya na-agba agba.
But now, of course, this approach is not ideal.	Ma ugbu a, n'ezie, ụzọ a adịghị mma.
I love it.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya.
Two or three years, he said.	Afọ abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ, o kwuru.
The temperature is high today.	Okpomọkụ dị elu taa.
They can speak for themselves.	Ha nwere ike ikwu maka onwe ha.
He said he was doing his best.	O kwuru na ya na-eme ike ya.
There is a strong will in this.	Ike siri ike na nke a.
This has no effect.	Nke a enweghị mmetụta.
I need to think about it.	Ọ kwesịrị m iche echiche banyere ya.
She hated her husband.	Ọ kpọrọ di ya asị.
He was there for me, looking for me.	Ọ nọ n'ebe m, na-achọ m.
He told her.	Ọ bụ ya gwara ya.
Anger with women.	Iwe na ụmụ nwanyị.
There were no lights on any windows.	Enweghị ọkụ na windo ọ bụla ahụrụ.
I saw it happen.	Ahụrụ m ka ọ na-eme.
He is doing well.	Ọ na-eme nke ọma.
In the distance.	N'ebe dị anya.
But it is my truth, of course.	Mana ọ bụ eziokwu m, n'ezie.
There is no way, no one.	Enweghị ụzọ, mba otu.
It is true, if you would like to know it.	Ọ bụ eziokwu, ma ọ bụrụ na ị ga-achọ ịma ịhụ ya.
I read and read and read.	M na-agụ ma na-agụ ma na-agụ.
The temperature is good.	Ọnọdụ okpomọkụ dị mma.
But none of you can.	Ma onye ọ bụla n'ime unu enweghị ike.
The drug should be given immediately.	Ekwesịrị inye ọgwụ ahụ ozugbo.
Reporting time is very important in this environment.	Oge akụkọ dị ezigbo mkpa gburugburu ebe a.
I think that's good.	Echere m na nke ahụ dị mma.
This story may be true.	Akụkọ a nwere ike ịbụ eziokwu.
Please make them as good as possible.	Biko mee ka ha dị ka nke ọma.
And good words, too.	Na ezigbo okwu, kwa.
Very similar indeed.	Yiri nnọọ n'ezie.
This is a really fun place.	Nke a bụ ebe ọ na-atọ ụtọ n'ezie.
The accident happened near his place of work.	Ihe mberede a mere nso ebe ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
You see, he did not know what he was talking about, like.	Ị hụrụ, ọ maghị ihe ọ na-ekwu, dị ka.
Violent behavior of children.	Omume ike ike nke ụmụaka.
Many of them can make your family sick.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha nwere ike ime ezinụlọ gị ọrịa.
The fire broke out in the night.	Ọkụ ahụ dara n'ime abalị.
No less great.	Ọ dịghị obere ukwuu.
I never thought of it that way.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m na-eche banyere ya otú ahụ.
I will tell you the truth here.	Aga m agwa gị eziokwu ebe a.
I like to meet new people.	Ọ na-amasị m ịhụ ndị ọhụrụ.
They know what a fire will do to the flesh.	Ha maara ihe ọkụ ọkụ ga-eme anụ ahụ.
This happened in my day.	Nke a mere ụbọchị m.
All we got was our house, our car and here.	Naanị ihe anyị nwetara bụ ụlọ anyị, ụgbọ ala anyị na ebe a.
They talked about good times.	Ha kwuru banyere oge ọma.
Smaller than you.	Obere karịa gị.
We only go to the movies!	Anyị na-aga naanị ihe nkiri!
Everything is fine, everything is fine.	Ihe niile dị mma, ihe niile dị mma.
It was done.	E mere ya.
He needed immediate help.	Ọ chọrọ enyemaka ngwa ngwa.
When you look back, it is.	Mgbe i lere anya azụ, ọ dị.
He had so much to do.	O nwere ọtụtụ ihe ọ ga-eme.
We ended the situation in various ways.	Anyị kwụsịrị ọnọdụ ahụ n'ụzọ dị iche iche.
Power can never be free.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ike nwere onwe.
Something like a promise.	Ihe dị ka nkwa.
They can play music.	Ha nwere ike ịkpọ egwu.
He is a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwoke.
The same people, and that.	Otu ndị ahụ, na nke ahụ.
The port can accommodate large ships.	Ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ nwere ike ibu nnukwu ụgbọ mmiri.
Now that said.	Ugbu a na nke ahụ kwuru.
I am someone else.	Abụ m onye ọzọ.
The room was full of beautiful people.	Ndị mara mma juru n'ọnụ ụlọ ahụ.
The two would not have looked so different.	Ha abụọ agaraghị adị ka ha dị iche.
This is the first time.	Nke a bụ nke mbụ.
But if it did.	Ma ọ bụrụ na o mere.
But there is nothing more than a nearby house.	Mana ọ nweghị ihe ọzọ karịa ụlọ dị nso.
It will come soon.	Ọ ga-abịa n'oge na-adịghị anya.
He asked me.	Ọ jụrụ m.
I could see the heat in front of me.	Enwere m ike ịhụ okpomọkụ ya n'ihu m.
There are no problems with the first three rules.	Enweghị nsogbu na iwu atọ mbụ.
There is nothing new in that.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọhụrụ na nke ahụ.
But they liked it.	Ma ha masịrị ya.
The mayor is the citizen.	Onye isi obodo bụ onye obodo ahụ.
But wait only a minute.	Mana chere naanị otu nkeji.
You, my beloved.	Gị onwe gị, onye m hụrụ n'anya.
He can be strong when he speaks.	O nwere ike ịdị ike mgbe ọ na-ekwu okwu.
I don't want to do it.	Achọghị m ime ya.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.
Get their expensive phone.	Nweta ekwentị ha dị oke ọnụ.
We will pretend not to see it.	Anyị ga-eme ka anyị ahụghị ya.
He is in trouble if he stays there long.	Ọ nọ ná nsogbu ma ọ bụrụ na ọ nọrọ ogologo oge n'ebe ahụ.
It will do nothing but make me happy.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ ga-eme ma ọ́ bụghị ime m obi ụtọ.
But he will do it.	Ma ọ ga-eme ya.
Only one of them is interested.	Naanị otu n'ime ha nwere mmasị.
I will travel.	M ga-eme njem.
Feel free.	Nwee mmetụta.
I do not know who or why.	Amaghị m onye ma ọ bụ ihe kpatara ya.
It won't be long now, he thought.	Ọ gaghị adị ogologo ugbu a, ka o chere.
Not that he had their feelings.	Ọ bụghị na o nwere mmetụta ha.
He told me about his legs.	Ọ gwara m gbasara ụkwụ ya.
But that is on the side of the subject.	Mana nke ahụ dị n'akụkụ isi okwu.
It should be small.	Ọ kwesịrị ịdị obere.
Everything nearby happened.	Ihe niile dị nso mere.
It is still early in the morning.	Ọ ka n'isi ụtụtụ.
Two rules, just for me.	Iwu abụọ, naanị maka m.
Probably a similar type.	Ma eleghị anya, ụdị yiri ya.
The girl looked around.	Nwa agbọghọ ahụ lere anya gburugburu ya.
Give him rest, men.	Nye ya izu ike, ndị nwoke.
It will be from the spring to the warmer months.	Ọ ga-adị site na mmiri mmiri na ọnwa okpomọkụ.
It is said that my hometown is very close.	A na-ekwu na obodo m dị ezigbo nso.
He called a few phones.	Ọ kpọrọ ekwentị ole na ole.
On the other hand.	Na nke ọzọ.
We never stopped seeing it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị kwụsịrị ịhụ ya.
It works well to be the only one.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma ịbụ naanị nke ahụ.
That is the way my life is.	Ụdị ihe ahụ ka ndụ m na-enwe.
I think we can really do something, special here.	Echere m na anyị nwere ike ime ihe n'ezie, pụrụ iche ebe a.
They are not.	Ha abụghị.
I am the new man.	Abụ m nwoke ọhụrụ ahụ.
I am really good.	Adị m mma n'ezie.
There is obviously a personal interest in the area.	O doro anya na enwere mmasị dị n'otu n'otu ebe ahụ.
Or is it.	Ma ọ bụ ya.
So the story goes.	Ya mere akụkọ na-aga.
To my right, the river.	N'aka nri m, osimiri.
The effect is negative.	Mmetụta ahụ adịghị mma.
I know him well.	M maara ya nke ọma.
What a terrible feeling it is.	Kedu mmetụta dị egwu ọ bụ.
Only the basics.	Naanị ihe bụ isi.
The cost of this service is.	Ọnụ ego nke ọrụ a bụ.
The lowest dog.	Nkịta kacha ala.
We have delicious food.	Anyị nwere nri dị ụtọ.
His authority is this.	Ikike ya bụ nke a.
Most of them are from.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha si na ya.
I know what awaits you now.	Ama m ihe na-eche gị ugbu a.
We do not.	Anyị anaghị eme ya.
He expected trouble.	Ọ tụrụ anya nsogbu.
It does not seem to be real.	O yighị ka ọ̀ bụ ihe dị adị.
Many residents would do the same.	Ọtụtụ ndị bi na ya gaara eme otu ihe ahụ.
My opinion is different from his.	Echiche m dị iche na nke ya.
It will not work.	Ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ.
One runs to tell the mother of the children.	Otu na-agba ọsọ gwa nne ụmụaka.
Nice to see you again.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ gị ọzọ.
So here we are.	Ya mere, ebe a anyị nọ.
The plaintiff, too, deserves his day in court.	Onye gbara akwụkwọ, kwa, kwesịrị ụbọchị ya n'ụlọ ikpe.
He can do it.	O nwere ike ime ya.
He did not know what to do to help.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ ga-eme iji nyere aka.
Do this every night for ten days.	Mee nke a kwa abalị ruo ụbọchị iri.
It was a good time to think.	Ọ bụ oge dị mma iche echiche.
Hard money cold.	Ego siri ike oyi.
I think about travel is different from others.	Echere m banyere njem dị iche na ndị ọzọ.
The flesh is said to be very beautiful.	A na-ekwu na anụ ahụ mara oke mma.
There is nothing more to this than that.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ na nke a n'ezie.
Let me make sure we are on the same page right now.	Ka m hụ na anyị nọ n'otu ibe ugbu a.
We did it once.	Anyị mere ya otu ugboro.
But there is more.	Ma enwere ebe ọzọ.
I love how strong.	M hụrụ n'anya otú ike.
But no one else did it.	Ma ọ dịghị onye ọzọ mere ya.
In fact, he wants her to leave.	N'ezie, ọ chọrọ ka ọ pụọ.
That is far greater than any other available.	Nke ahụ dị nnọọ ukwuu karịa otu ọ bụla ọzọ dị.
What do you suggest we do? 	Kedu ihe ị tụrụ aro ka anyị mee?
But they are not there.	Ma ha anọghị ebe ahụ.
he asked.	ọ jụrụ.
He is grateful to you.	Ya na daalụ na ị.
The race for new things happened fast.	Ọsọ nke ihe ọhụrụ mere ngwa ngwa.
They should not think about it.	Ha ekwesịghị iche echiche banyere ya.
It doesn't matter, 'he said.	Ọ dịghị mkpa,' ka o kwuru.
Our eyes met.	Anya anyị zutere.
Maybe they should.	Ma eleghị anya, ha kwesịrị.
She told him she was pregnant.	Ọ gwara ya na ọ dị ime.
Just always by everything available.	Naanị mgbe niile site na ihe niile dị.
He seems to be everywhere right away.	O yiri ka ọ nọ ebe niile ozugbo.
They are all old beans.	Ha niile bụ agwa ochie.
They arrived early in the morning for the game.	Ha rutere n'isi ụtụtụ maka egwuregwu.
But they are not the same.	Ma ha abụghị otu ụdị.
This is not my room.	Nke a abụghị ime ụlọ m.
Trouble in all this time.	Nsogbu na ihe a niile bụ oge.
I love things.	Ahụrụ m ihe n'anya.
We run at night.	Anyị na-agba ọsọ n'abalị.
This new cargo ship is longer than most.	Ụgbọ mmiri ibu ọhụrụ a dị ogologo karịa ọtụtụ.
Every day is a new day.	Ụbọchị ọ bụla bụ ụbọchị ọhụrụ.
He lives near her.	O bi nso ya.
I can't brag more.	Enweghị m ike ịnya isi karịa.
There is no good reason for these special rules.	Enweghị ezi ihe kpatara iwu ndị a pụrụ iche.
And he saw it.	O wee hụ ya.
I work in a water company.	M na-arụ ọrụ na ụlọ ọrụ mmiri ọṅụṅụ.
So they immediately put him in our group.	Ya mere, ha tinyere ya ozugbo na otu anyị.
But they did not find anyone.	Ma ha ahụghị onye ọ bụla.
The difference is in their application.	Ihe dị iche bụ na ngwa ha.
We mention the name of the company.	Anyị na-ekwu aha ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
It just happened.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe merenụ.
Be aware of the differences that your example might be.	Mara ihe dị iche iche nke ihe atụ gị nwere ike ịbụ.
Others resemble only his first name.	Ndị ọzọ yiri naanị aha mbụ ya.
This is not the same.	Nke a abụghị otu.
The wood is very strong.	Osisi ahụ siri ike nke ukwuu.
Get out! 	Pụọ!
I will not talk to you tomorrow.	Agaghị m agwa gị okwu echi.
No way.	Ụzọ adịghị.
That is courage.	Nke ahụ bụ obi ike.
One thing is certain, however.	Otú ọ dị, otu ihe doro anya.
One case is important.	Otu ikpe dị mkpa.
This is it, this is its great opportunity.	Nke a bụ ya, nke a bụ nnukwu ohere ya.
For the first few days she did not eat anything.	N'ime ụbọchị ole na ole mbụ ọ gaghị eri ihe ọ bụla.
Make it necessary.	Mee ka ọ dị mkpa.
I never thought you could do it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chere na ị nwere ike ime ya.
It's really beautiful.	Ọ mara mma n'ezie.
The value is excellent.	Uru dị oke mma.
That is one way to see the truth.	Nke ahụ bụ otu n'ime ụzọ isi hụ eziokwu.
My pleasure, my thoughts.	Ihe ụtọ m, echiche m.
I want to know how long they really are.	Achọrọ m ịma ka ogologo ha dị n'ezie.
Or my body.	Ma ọ bụ ahụ m.
We are not who we are.	Anyị abụghị ndị anyị bụ.
There will be one last time, one last chance.	A ga-enwe oge ikpeazụ, ohere ikpeazụ.
Not now, not at all, he said.	Ọ bụghị ugbu a, ọ bụghị mgbe ọ bụla, o kwuru.
No meat, please.	Enweghị anụ, biko.
So that's what happened.	Ya mere nke ahụ bụ ihe mere.
If it is too wet, it will not survive.	Ọ bụrụ na oke mmiri, ọ gaghị adị ndụ.
It can not happen.	O nweghị ike ime.
That would be really nice.	Nke ahụ ga-adị mma n'ezie.
There .	Ebe ahụ .
I have a fear for him and for myself.	Enwere m egwu maka ya na mụ onwe m.
But he never did it.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe ọ mere ya.
They make rules for their activities.	Ha na-eme iwu maka ihe omume ha.
It is the layer.	Ọ bụ oyi akwa ahụ.
She was happy that she drank so little.	Obi dị ya ụtọ na mmanya riri ya ntakịrị.
We are looking for a girl.	Anyị na-achọ nwa agbọghọ.
It’s about ideas.	Ọ bụ maka echiche.
They can't see it.	Ha enweghị ike ịhụ ya.
Of course, it can be really easy.	N'ezie, ọ nwere ike ịdị mfe n'ezie.
Not everyone wants legal work these days.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla chọrọ ọrụ iwu n'oge a.
How quickly they came.	Otú ha si bịa ngwa ngwa.
Man you can brag about.	Nwoke ị nwere ike ịnya isi.
But the reality is different.	Ma eziokwu dị nnọọ iche.
I love us together.	Ahụrụ m anyị n'anya ọnụ.
None of these things are judgmental.	Nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị ahụ abụghị ikpe.
Let us know if you have any questions.	Mee ka anyị mara ma ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ ihe ọ bụla.
The place has no name, either.	Ebe ahụ enweghị aha, ma.
But the problem continues beyond that.	Ma nsogbu na-aga n'ihu karịa nke ahụ.
Everyone.	Onye ọ bụla.
He was angry at the messenger.	Iwe were ya n’ebe onye ozi ahụ nọ.
Of course, it is bad.	N'ezie, ọ dị njọ.
I want to offer some help.	Achọrọ m inye ụfọdụ enyemaka.
But that is not the way history has been.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka akụkọ ihe mere eme si mee.
He cannot do anything wrong.	O nweghị ike ime ihe ọjọọ.
It is very difficult.	O siri ezigbo ike.
Today he left work early in the morning.	Taa ọ hapụrụ ọrụ n'isi ụtụtụ.
I thought fast.	Echere m ngwa ngwa.
He thought it would be a fun event.	O chere na ọ ga-abụ ihe omume na-atọ ụtọ.
I do not understand why no one does it.	Aghọtaghị m ihe kpatara na ọ nweghị onye na-eme ya.
That happened the third time last week.	Nke ahụ mere nke atọ n'ime izu gara aga.
It does not seem to matter.	O yighị ka ọ dị mkpa.

He wants it that he should not do that.	Ọ chọrọ na o kwesịghị ịdị na-eme nke a.
This is true in two ways.	Nke a bụ eziokwu n'ụzọ abụọ.
He saw that the two of them enjoyed each other's company.	Ọ hụrụ ka ha abụọ na-atọ ibe ha ụtọ.
We were here to stay.	Anyị nọrọ ebe a na-atọ ụtọ.

The internal space is small.	Ohere ime ya dị ntakịrị.

However, the task is easier said than done.	Otú ọ dị, ọrụ ahụ dị mfe ikwu karịa ime.

Anyway, it was the man in the picture there.	N'agbanyeghị, ọ bụ nwoke ahụ nọ na foto a n'ebe ahụ.
He understood it well.	Ọ ghọtara ya nke ọma.
There is nothing you can do to stop it.	O nweghị ihe ị ga-eme iji kwụsị ya.
For many, this is a new concept.	Nye ọtụtụ ndị nke a bụ echiche ọhụrụ.

Two children died.	Ụmụaka abụọ nwụrụ.
I want him by my side all the days of my life.	Achọrọ m ya n'akụkụ m ụbọchị niile nke ndụ m.
Unemployment in this country is a big problem.	Enweghị ọrụ na mba a bụ nnukwu nsogbu.
It can be scary.	Ọ nwere ike ịdị egwu.
That works a lot, much better.	Nke ahụ na-arụ ọrụ nke ukwuu, ka mma.
The music was at work.	Egwu ahụ nọ na-arụ ọrụ ya.
He said who was behind.	O kwuru onye nọ n'azụ.
Just that it really did, really good.	Naanị na ọ dara n'ezie, ezigbo mma.

Foolishness comes after a sleepless night.	Nzuzu na-abịa mgbe a abalị na-enweghị ụra.

He does not love.	Ọ naghị ahụ n'anya.
But in this case none of the latter.	Ma na nke a ọ dịghị nke ndị ikpeazụ.
One of them called her this morning.	Otu n’ime ha kpọrọ ya n’ụtụtụ a.
I hope you all like it.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ masịrị gị niile.

His back is at the door now.	Azụ ya dị n'ọnụ ụzọ ugbu a.
You said it.	I kwuru ya .
This is a huge benefit for us.	Nke a bụ nnukwu uru nye anyị.
The whole fight seemed to go away.	Ọgụ ahụ niile dị ka ọ si ya pụọ.
He was young, new to no power at all.	Ọ bụ nwata, ọ dị ọhụrụ nke enweghị ike ọ bụla.
His misdeeds were numerous.	Omume ọjọọ ya dị ọtụtụ.
It is special.	Ọ pụrụ iche.
From the past, in other words.	Site n'oge gara aga, na okwu ndị ọzọ.
There is no question for such things here.	Enweghị ajụjụ maka ihe ndị dị otú ahụ ebe a.
I only knew the man.	M ma naanị nwoke ahụ.
Sometimes they succeed.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha na-enwe ihe ịga nke ọma.

There are only three customers in the restaurant.	Enwere naanị ndị ahịa atọ na ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ.

He is my best friend.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi m.

The house was filled with bad smells.	Isi ọjọọ juru ụlọ ahụ.
Most people are not interested.	Ọtụtụ ndị enweghị mmasị.
But in some ways it is better.	Ma n'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ọ ka mma.
Many large, long-distance apartments were built.	A na-arụ ọtụtụ nnukwu ụlọ ogologo oge.
This is work.	Nke a bụ ọrụ.
I love the place.	Ahụrụ m ebe ahụ n'anya.
Because that's the way it is.	N'ihi na ọ bụ otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
Most likely they will not.	O yikarịrị ka ha agaghị.
The man lives by the river.	Nwoke ahụ bi n’akụkụ osimiri.
No annual salary.	Enweghị ụgwọ afọ.
But most of the time you do not have time to do this.	Mana ọtụtụ mgbe ị naghị enwe oge ime nke a.
However you will.	Otú ọ dị ị ga-amasị.
They are good that I am with him.	Ha dị mma na mụ na ya dị.

Of course, all of this is important.	N'ezie, ihe ndị a niile dị mkpa.

But now is not the time.	Ma ugbu a abụghị oge.
I gotta Feeling.	Enwere m mmetụta.
Many cities have schools.	Ọtụtụ obodo nwere ụlọ akwụkwọ.
The game was a success.	Egwuregwu ahụ gara nke ọma.
The dress was made.	E mere akwa ahụ.
And the second would be fine.	Na nke abụọ ga-adị mma.

I do not know what happens to him.	Amaghị m ihe na-eme ya.
That he could be whoever he wanted to be.	Na ọ nwere ike ịbụ onye ọ bụla ọ chọrọ ịbụ.
Sometimes this is the case.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, nke a dị otú ahụ.
The mother speaks only her thoughts.	Nne ahụ na-ekwu naanị echiche ya.
He looked his way.	O lere anya ụzọ ya.
I really feel it.	Enwere m mmetụta ya n'ezie.
They both felt guilty.	Obi ama ha abụọ ikpe.
Stop them if you can.	Kwụsị ha ma ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike.
For the same reason.	N'ihi otu ihe ahụ.
He could not do it quickly.	O nweghị ike ime ya ngwa ngwa.
Good thing !.	Ihe dị mma!.
There are many examples of this.	E nwere ọtụtụ ihe atụ nke a.
They gave him an idea.	Ha nyere ya echiche.
Otherwise, wait for us.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, chere anyị.
What it is and what it does.	Ihe ọ bụ na ihe ọ na-eme.
I think it's beautiful.	Echere m na ọ mara mma.
I do not understand how this can be.	Aghọtaghị m ka nke a nwere ike ịbụ.
It seems to be working well.	Ọ dị ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
They can see such things.	Ha nwere ike ịhụ ihe ndị dị otú ahụ.
They can do what they want.	Ha nwere ike ime ihe ha chọrọ.
But the idea is far from over.	Ma echiche ahụ adịghị n'isi.
From the first minute, we knew it was special.	Site na nkeji mbụ, anyị maara na ọ pụrụ iche.
Or they can.	Ma ọ bụ ha nwere ike.
There is a car.	Enwere ụgbọ ala.
They called some of their friends.	Ha kpọrọ ụfọdụ ndị enyi ha.
It would not be good with this.	Ọ gaghị adị mma na nke a.
If that works.	Ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ na-arụ ọrụ.
With that, we are still waiting.	Na nke ahụ, anyị ka na-eche.
Three times he died.	Ugboro atọ nwụrụ.
But she does not want to cry.	Ma ọ chọghị ibe ákwá.
Of course, this is not always the case.	N'ezie, nke a abụghị mgbe niile.
He is happy to have something to do.	Obi dị ya ụtọ inwe ihe ọ ga-eme.
Such a thing is for others.	Ihe dị otú ahụ bụ maka ndị ọzọ.
But most likely.	Ma o yikarịrị.
It seems like most of it is a book.	Ọ dị ka ọtụtụ n'ime ya bụ akwụkwọ.
It can be.	O nwere ike ịbụ.
We got money, but not friends.	Anyị nwetara ego, ma ọ bụghị enyi.
We want more, now that we have it.	Anyị chọrọ karịa, ugbu a anyị nwetara ya.
I am grateful for his work.	Obi dị m ụtọ maka ọrụ ya.
You want to be human.	Ị chọrọ ịbụ mmadụ.

Get the girl.	Nweta nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
The truth does not matter.	Eziokwu adịghị mkpa.

Not recommended for children.	A naghị atụ aro maka ụmụaka.

One man was stabbed in the afternoon.	A tụrụ otu nwoke mma n’ehihie.
You said you did not want that yourself.	I kwuru na ị chọghị nke ahụ n'onwe gị.
After all, but what does this do.	Mgbe niile, ma gịnị ka nke a ga-eme.
In these applications, the energy consumption can be very high.	N'ime ngwa ndị a, ike oriri nwere ike ịdị oke elu.

The ball went on.	Bọọlụ gara n'ihu.
That's true.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu.

Both are big fights.	Ha abụọ bụ nnukwu ọgụ.

There was a large crowd in his room.	E nwere nnukwu igwe mmadụ n’ime ụlọ ya.
It would seem that he has a different word.	Ọ ga-adị ka ọ nwere okwu dị iche.

Maybe you will be different.	Ma eleghị anya, ị ga-adị iche.
Everything to come is here.	Ihe niile na-abịa n'ihu dị ebe a.
Most people go right away.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-aga ozugbo.
He stopped working that day	Ọ kwụsịrị ọrụ ụbọchị ahụ
Much can be said about the story for obvious reasons.	Enweghị ike ikwu ọtụtụ ihe gbasara akụkọ ahụ maka ihe doro anya.
They had many happy years ahead of them.	Ha nwere ọtụtụ afọ obi ụtọ n'ihu ha.

No one believed him.	Ọ dịghị onye kwere ya.

It will be better than people expected.	Ọ ga-adị mma karịa ka ndị mmadụ tụrụ anya ya.
You can not do both.	Ị nweghị ike ime ha abụọ.

None of them seemed to like him.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha yiri mmasị n'ebe ọ nọ.

Questions were asked but there was no time for them.	A jụrụ ajụjụ mana o nweghị oge maka ha.

There will be a hospital.	Ọ ga-enwe ụlọ ọgwụ.
Then she started to cry.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ malitere ibe ákwá.

These are good.	Ndị a dị mma.
Meanwhile, everything about it is different.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, ihe niile banyere ya dị iche.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.
It's like a long flight.	Ọ dị ka ụgbọ elu dị anya.
Of course not.	N'ezie mba.
Certainly not for the man.	N'ezie ọ bụghị nye nwoke ahụ.
But this is not the whole picture.	Mana nke a abụghị foto niile.
But he still made a point.	Ma, ọ ka na-eme isi ihe.
They certainly do not like it.	N'ezie ha adịghị amasị ya.
He is in a bad way.	Ọ nọ n'ụzọ ọjọọ.
What a game that is.	Kedu egwuregwu nke ahụ bụ.
Maybe something will happen tonight.	Ma eleghị anya, ihe ga-eme n'abalị a.
International staff perform this event.	Ndị ọrụ si mba ọzọ na-eme ihe omume a.
It was just what he needed.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe ọ ga-achọ.
He left.	O si ebe ahụ pụọ.
The food was delicious.	Nri ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
They do not want me to go alone.	Ha achọghị ka m gaa naanị m.
This is different.	Nke a dị iche.
In fact, he seems to be angry.	N'ezie, o yiri ka iwe were ya.
They are not the ones you want in your one project.	Ha abụghị ndị ị chọrọ na otu ọrụ gị.
That's better.	Nke ahụ ka mma.
He was no doubt truthful.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na o kwuru eziokwu.
One of the staff works.	Otu onye n'ime ndị ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ.
They are just.	Ha dị nnọọ.
Something beautiful.	Ihe mara mma.
They would not let him live.	Ha agaghị ekwe ka ọ dị ndụ.
My classmates say the same thing about me.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ibe m na-ekwu ihe a gbasara m.
Big money of anything.	Nnukwu ego nke ihe ọ bụla.
Of course, some teachers do not do those things.	N'ezie, ụfọdụ ndị nkuzi anaghị eme ihe ndị ahụ.
No one is doing it.	Ọ dịghị onye na-eme ya.
It can't happen.	Ọ dịghị ike ime.
All vegetables are good.	Akwụkwọ nri niile dị mma.
Many were angry.	Ọtụtụ ndị iwe were.
So he may not be very interested.	Ya mere ọ nwere ike ọ gaghị enwe mmasị dị ukwuu.
That is what a person does.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe mmadụ na-eme.
Do this well.	Mee nke a nke ọma.
Thank you for your kind words.	Daalụ maka okwu ọma gị.
Not that he was looking for it.	Ọ bụghị na ọ na-achọ ya.
One taste is important.	Otu ụtọ dị mkpa.
It is neither good nor bad.	Ọ dịghị mma ma ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ.

That cannot be said here.	Enweghị ike ikwu nke ahụ ebe a.
This is one of these weeks.	Nke a bụ otu n'ime izu ndị a.
And a year ago.	Na otu afọ gara aga.
Most of us know the game in terms of rules.	Ọtụtụ n'ime anyị maara egwuregwu na iwu.
This is nothing new.	Nke a abụghị ihe ọhụrụ.
If you are truthful? 	Ọ bụrụ na ị bụ onye eziokwu?
We never had a reason for it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị nwere ihe kpatara ya.
But it won't happen to me.	Ma ọ gaghị eme m.

It is indeed a unique opportunity.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ohere pụrụ iche.
No one has been strong since.	O nweghị onye siri ike kemgbe ahụ.
Beautiful laughter.	Ọchị mara mma.
I know they are not moving forward.	Ama m na ha anaghị aga n'ihu.
Now you need to do something about it.	Ugbu a, i kwesịrị ime ihe banyere ya.
Something beautiful and powerful happens.	Ihe mara mma ma dị ike na-eme.
You probably do not know what he is doing there.	O doro anya na ị maghị ihe ọ na-eme ebe ahụ.
He makes himself a fool.	Ọ na-eme onwe ya onye nzuzu.
I love it so much.	Ahụrụ m nke ukwuu.
They cannot be different.	Ha enweghị ike ịdị iche.
Not everyone.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ bụla.
He refuses to acknowledge that he has done nothing wrong.	Ọ jụrụ ikweta na o mere ihe ọjọọ ọ bụla.
It does not need to be present.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ka ọ dị ugbu a.
Very little at that.	Obere obere na nke ahụ.
I am good at that.	Adị m mma na nke ahụ.
The type that is characterized by simplicity.	Ụdị nke e ji ịdị mfe mara.
Food is a major problem anyway.	Nri bụ isi nsogbu n'agbanyeghị.
Wait until you have finished your work.	Chere ruo mgbe ị kwụsịrị ọrụ gị.
We will continue to move forward together.	Anyị ga-aga n'ihu na-aga n'ihu ọnụ.
Some forms of interest.	Ụdị mmasị ụfọdụ.
Other forms of similarity seem unlikely.	Ụdị ndị ọzọ yiri nke ahụ yiri ka ọ gaghị ekwe omume.

Soon, their eyes met.	Obere oge, anya ha zutere.

Police say these people died suddenly.	Ndị uwe ojii na-ekwu na ndị a nwụrụ na mberede.
They sat down.	Ha nọrọ ọdụ.

Most of them just want to play.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha chọrọ naanị igwu egwu.

This is just a simple example of the problem.	Nke a bụ naanị ihe atụ dị mfe nke nsogbu ahụ.

They both went to school together.	Ha abụọ gara akwụkwọ ọnụ.
All the way.	N'ụzọ niile.
I saw her with the baby.	Ahụrụ m ya na nwa ọhụrụ ahụ.
Or does he just not pay attention when you tell him something to do?	Ma ọ bụ na o mere nnọọ.
It will not be good.	Ọ gaghị adị mma.

The meeting was adjourned.	A kwụsịrị nzukọ ahụ.
Are you with us?	Ị nọ na anyị?.
I do not know what he is doing.	Amaghị ihe ọ na-eme.
I think we can both go.	Echere m na anyị abụọ nwere ike ịga.
You do not want the truth.	Ị chọghị eziokwu.
I do that a lot.	M na-eme nke ahụ nke ukwuu.
We saw three girls dancing.	Anyị hụrụ ụmụ agbọghọ atọ na-agba egwu.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Ọ dị ka ihe dị egwu maka ụlọ.
Perhaps your work is harder than most people realize.	Eleghị anya ọrụ gị siri ike karịa ka ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ghọtara.

I think my strength is a story.	Echere m na ike m bụ akụkọ.
He should not see that we are here.	O kwesịghị ịhụ na anyị nọ ebe a.

Small village.	Obere ime obodo.

A man who loves his home, loves his country, loves his country.	Nwoke hụrụ ụlọ ya n'anya, hụ obodo ya n'anya, hụ obodo ya n'anya.
He refused to give his name to the police.	Ọ jụrụ inye ndị uwe ojii aha ya.

He had a lot of fun.	O nwere oke ọchị.
And almost no one does not.	Na ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ na ọ dịghị onye na-adịghị.
I have to do that.	Ekwesịrị m ime nke ahụ.
These are things you should know.	Ndị a bụ ihe ị kwesịrị ịma.
He did it alone.	O mere ya naanị ya.
It is because of what we are doing here.	Ọ bụ maka ihe anyị na-eme ebe a.
Let me know any suggestions on this.	Mee ka m mara ụdị aro ọ bụla gbasara nke a.
The store is not far from the beach.	Ụlọ ahịa ahụ adịghị anya n'akụkụ osimiri.
We were amazed to see it.	Ịhụ ya tụrụ anyị n’anya.
His bag is there.	Akpa ya dị ebe ahụ.
He is a good student.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwa akwụkwọ.
And see this.	Ma hụ nke a.
Each time, I still enjoy it.	Oge ọ bụla, ọ ka na-atọ m ụtọ.
It scared me.	Ọ tụrụ m egwu.
Something else here.	Ihe ọzọ ebe a.
I need to get out of here.	Ekwesịrị m ịpụ ebe a.
I slapped him.	M mara ya ụra.
He has since died.	Ọ nwụrụ kemgbe.
They can really.	Ha nwere ike n'ezie.
Our thoughts run.	Echiche anyị na-agba ọsọ.
Type of view.	Ụdị echiche.
He fought.	Ọ gbara ọgụ.
Three, because his teammates expected it from him.	Atọ, n'ihi na ndị otu ya na-atụ anya ya n'aka ya.
I do not know what makes this happen.	Amaghị m ihe na-eme nke a.

This place is so beautiful.	Ebe a mara ezigbo mma.
They are right.	Ha kwuru eziokwu.
His original story is unknown.	Amaghị akụkọ mbụ ya.
There are only four people in the room.	Naanị mmadụ anọ nọ n'ime ụlọ ahụ.
I doubt, as many people will.	Enwere m obi abụọ, dị ka ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ga-enwe.
I think about that a lot.	M na-eche banyere nke ahụ nke ukwuu.
Gradually.	Nke nta nke nta.
But that idea can be wrong.	Mana echiche ahụ nwere ike ịdị njọ.
But there are stupid questions, believe me.	Mana enwere ajụjụ nzuzu, kwere m.
Like our book.	Dị ka akwụkwọ anyị.
She knows photography.	Ọ maara foto.
Their salaries are lower than those of other workers.	Ụgwọ ọnwa ha dị ala karịa nke ndị ọrụ ndị ọzọ.
This is not the case.	Nke a abụghị otu ahụ.
The headline is awesome.	Isi ahụ dị egwu.
They were expensive then.	Ha adịghị ọnụ n'oge ahụ.

This has a personal impact.	Nke a nwere mmetụta nke ihe onwe onye.

He thought that was the right way.	O chere na nke ahụ bụ ụzọ dị mma.

And these.	Na ndị a.
In the message.	Na ozi.
He tried to distract her from the problem.	Ọ gbalịrị ime ka uche ya pụọ ​​ná nsogbu ahụ.
You are beautiful.	Ị mara mma.
It needs speed.	Ọ chọrọ ọsọ ọsọ.
That will help.	Nke ahụ ga-enyere ihe aka.
We got the money.	Anyị nwetara ego ahụ.
I think he is here.	Echere m na ọ nọ ebe a.
This trip is my vacation.	Njem a bụ ezumike m.
She is not a woman.	Ọ bụghị nwanyị.
He has the power to do his will.	O nwere ikike ime uche ya.
As a child.	Dị ka nwata.
Your grandmother is beautiful.	Nne nne gị mara mma.
They have the health of happy men when I am with them.	Ha na-enwe ahụ́ ike ụmụ nwoke nwere obi ụtọ mgbe mụ na ha nọ.
He was right.	O kwuru eziokwu.
It is so.	Ọ bụ otú a.

He knows what happened to me.	Ọ ma ihe mere m.
But we kept thinking about it for a few minutes.	Ma anyị nọ na-eche naanị banyere ya maka nkeji ole na ole.
However, that did happen.	Otú ọ dị, ihe ahụ mere.

He said to take your position.	O kwuru ka were ọnọdụ gị.
Again, for several hours.	Ọzọ, ruo ọtụtụ awa.

Everyone else was around.	Ndị ọzọ niile gbara ya gburugburu.
Glad I met him.	Obi dị m ụtọ na m zutere ya.

You can call it anything you want.	Ị nwere ike ịkpọ ya ihe ọ bụla ịchọrọ.
I know that what we have is unique.	Ama m na ihe anyị nwere pụrụ iche.
It surprised me even more.	Ọ tụrụ m n'anya karịa.

He said he had good reason to do so.	O kwuru na ya nwere ezi ihe mere o ji mee ya.
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
I do not want him to see me this way.	Achọghị m ka ọ hụ m otú a.
I have big doubts in myself.	Enwere m nnukwu obi abụọ n'ime m.
But this house is very beautiful.	Mana ụlọ a mara mma nke ukwuu.
We have a promise now.	Anyị nwere nkwa ugbu a.
There are two ways.	Enwere ụzọ abụọ.
It works well.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
This would not have been possible.	Nke a agaraghị ekwe omume.
Patients taking this medication should eat regularly.	Ndị ọrịa na-aṅụ ọgwụ a kwesịrị ịdị na-eri nri mgbe niile.
For many it is both.	Maka ọtụtụ ndị ọ bụ ha abụọ.
If there was a bad game to do, they did it.	Ọ bụrụ na e nwere egwuregwu ọjọọ ime, ha mere ya.
That’s what I’m trying to do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe m na-agbalị ime.

He did not know why.	Ọ maghị nke ọ maghị ihe kpatara ya.

I was looking forward to the new one.	M tụrụ ya anya na nke ọhụrụ.
They love their children very much.	Ha hụrụ ụmụ ha n’anya nke ukwuu.
I don't want you here.	Achọghị m gị ebe a.
This will not make anything worse.	Nke a agaghị eme ka ihe ọ bụla ka njọ.
At night.	N'abalị.
He is our Father.	Ọ bụ ya bụ nna anyị.
He ran fast.	Ọ gbara ọsọ ọsọ.
She can be called a mother.	Enwere ike ịkpọ ya nne.
The locals know it is not funny.	Ndị obodo maara na ọ naghị akpa ọchị.
I want that for me.	Achọrọ m nke ahụ maka m.
They like to eat there.	Ha na-enwe mmasị iri nri n'ebe ahụ.
You need every benefit to be by your side.	Ị chọrọ uru ọ bụla iji nọrọ n'akụkụ gị.
I am not special.	Abụghị m onye pụrụ iche.
I do not know who he is.	Amaghị m onye ọ bụ.
We know of only two such works in the past.	Anyị maara naanị ọrụ abụọ dị otú ahụ gara aga.
Ten years.	Afọ iri.
I can know what can help you.	Enwere m ike ịma ihe nwere ike inyere gị aka.
There is food waiting for you.	Enwere nri na-eche gị.
It looks so good on it.	Ọ mara ezigbo mma na ya.
Can you imagine anything ?.	Ị nwere ike iche ihe ọ bụla?.
It's like a family.	Ọ dị ka ezinụlọ.
I want you to be here for your trial.	Achọrọ m ka ị nọrọ ebe a maka ikpe gị.
Both ways of speaking are true.	Ụzọ abụọ nke ikwu okwu bụ eziokwu.
I could be there with him.	Enwere m ike iso ya nọrọ ebe ahụ.
It is a cold night.	Ọ bụ abalị oyi.
She gave birth to this baby while he was thinking.	Ọ mụrụ nwa ọhụrụ a ka ọ na-eche echiche.
No one knows how to do that.	Ọ dịghị onye maara otú e si eme nke ahụ.
They know what we are doing.	Ha ma ihe anyị na-eme.
But there is.	Ma e nwere.
This time he stayed for several days.	Oge a ọ nọrọ ọtụtụ ụbọchị.
There are no drugs and all of these things.	Enweghị ọgwụ ọjọọ na ihe ndị a niile.
No, there is no problem.	Mba, ọ nweghị nsogbu.
As bad news can be.	Dị ka akụkọ ọjọọ nwere ike ịbụ.
That is good.	Nke ahụ dị mma.
They go for it.	Ha na-aga na ya.
Customers, however, thought differently.	Otú ọ dị, ndị ahịa chere n'ụzọ dị iche.
Of course, it’s a small thing.	N'ezie, ọ bụ obere ihe.

They are not interested in everything.	Ha enweghị mmasị na ihe niile.
They are not his question.	Ha abụghị ajụjụ ya.
But no one really knows.	Ma ọ dịghị onye maara n'ezie.
He had a strong sense of accomplishment.	O nwere mmetụta siri ike nke ọrụ.
It's a craft from here.	Ọ bụ ọrụ aka si ebe a.
Let us take a few examples.	Ka anyị were ihe atụ ole na ole.
It should be bought at another opportunity.	Ekwesịrị iji ohere ọzọ zụta ya.
You can't say goodbye.	Ị nweghị ike ikwu ya pụọ.
Some methods seem to exist now.	Ụfọdụ ụzọ yiri ka ọ dị ugbu a.
Only people run sometimes.	Naanị ndị mmadụ na-agba ọsọ mgbe ụfọdụ.
But the next night they were going to the party.	Ma abalị echi ha na-aga oriri nzuzu ahụ.
Before that, she knew only the mother.	Tupu nke a, ọ maara naanị nne.
You need information.	Ị chọrọ ozi.
I started to feel nervous.	Ụjọ malitere ịma m.
He died of fear.	Ụjọ nwụrụ ya.
A few women.	Ụmụ nwanyị ole na ole.
There are two possible cases.	Enwere ike ime ikpe abụọ.
He was afraid but not because everyone else was there.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya ma ọ bụghị n'ihi ihe mere onye ọ bụla ọzọ ji nọrọ.
However, it has just begun.	Otú ọ dị, ọ ka malitere.

One thing at a time.	Otu ihe n'otu oge.
Believe me, it will not work.	Kwere m, ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ.
We really like this place.	Ọ masịrị anyị ebe a nke ọma.

Could not be either.	Enweghị ike ịbụ ma.
Well wait a minute.	Ọ dị mma chere otu nkeji.

Without it, the company would not be able to feed its employees properly.	Enweghị ya, ụlọ ọrụ ahụ enweghị ike inye ndị ọrụ ya nri nke ọma.

Good food, perfect food, good food.	Ezi nri, nri zuru oke, nri dị mma.
I looked at the building.	M lere anya banyere ụlọ ahụ.
But life is not cheap.	Ma ndụ adịghị ọnụ ala.
Her clothes are beautiful.	Uwe ya mara mma.
They got a lot of things.	Ha nwetara ọtụtụ ihe.
Near the school.	Na nso ụlọ akwụkwọ.

We always act as one.	Anyị na-eme ihe mgbe niile dị ka otu.
That is difficult for all of our members.	Nke ahụ siri ike nye ndị otu anyị niile.
The most important thing.	Ihe kacha mkpa.
Where is that? 	Ebee ka ihe ahụ dị?

Maybe it's a little bit of a second.	Eleghị anya ọ bụ ntakịrị ntakịrị nke abụọ ahụ.

You can find one that is used for a reasonable price.	Ị nwere ike ịchọta nke eji eme ihe maka ọnụ ahịa dị mma.
We have these books in our school.	Anyị nwere akwụkwọ ndị a n'ụlọ akwụkwọ anyị.

Then you think of another form.	Mgbe ahụ ị chere maka ụdị ọzọ.
The reason is simple.	Ihe kpatara ya dị mfe.
Otherwise, it's nothing.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, o nweghị ihe ọ bụla.

Nothing will happen if people do anything.	Ọ dịghị ihe ga-eme ma ọ bụrụ na ndị mmadụ eme ihe ọ bụla.

But this is the reality of the market at work.	Ma nke a bụ eziokwu nke ahịa na-arụ ọrụ.
He was waiting in the window waiting.	Ọ nọ na-eche na windo na-eche.
Sadly, many of you are doing just that.	Ọ dị nwute, ọtụtụ n'ime unu na-eme nke ahụ.

Not many opportunities for him to go.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ohere maka ya ịga.

The fact is that no one sees me anywhere.	Nke bụ eziokwu bụ na mmadụ anaghị ahụ m ebe ọ bụla.

So you are right.	Ya mere i kwuru eziokwu.

Everything was beautiful.	Ihe niile wee mara mma.
It’s game time.	Ọ bụ oge egwuregwu.

However, he is not concerned about it today.	Otú ọ dị, o nweghị obi maka ya taa.
Naturally, dinner has just begun.	Dị ka o kwesịrị ịdị, nri abalị ka malitere.

He looked back.	O lere anya azụ.
This can be a simple game.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ egwuregwu dị mfe.
But there are limits.	Ma enwere oke.
I see the body as a gift.	Ana m ahụ ahụ dị ka onyinye.

This time we enjoy now.	Oge a na-atọ anyị ụtọ ugbu a.
They go on and on and on.	Ha na-aga n'ihu na-aga n'ihu.

The study continued despite adverse weather conditions.	Ọmụmụ ihe ahụ gara n'ihu n'agbanyeghị ọnọdụ ihu igwe adịghị mma.
In a sense, it did.	N'otu echiche, o mere.
You too can see it and see it.	Gị onwe gị nwere ike ịhụ ya wee hụ ya.
We can think of this in another way.	Anyị nwere ike iche echiche banyere nke a n'ụzọ ọzọ.
Without your ball, there is no way he can play.	Enweghị bọọlụ gị, ọ nweghị ụzọ ọ ga-esi enwe ike igwu egwu.
They will like you.	Ha ga-amasị gị.
From someone else.	Site na onye ọzọ.

You made me go.	Ị mere ka m gaa.
He may not have been a good man.	O nwere ike ịbụ na ọ bụghị ezigbo nwoke.

The fact is that very few people go to these things right away from work.	Nke bụ eziokwu bụ mmadụ ole na ole na-aga ihe ndị a ozugbo site n'ọrụ.
There will be no point.	Agaghị enwe isi.

And we know, too.	Na anyị maara, kwa.
Her husband had new responsibilities at work.	Di ya nwere ibu ọrụ ọhụrụ n'ọrụ.
I think people are ready for it.	Echere m na ndị mmadụ dị njikere maka ya.
Otherwise, the place looks very similar.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ebe ahụ yiri nke ukwuu.
For others, it was last week.	Maka ndị ọzọ, ọ bụ izu gara aga.

You want it, they have it.	Ị chọrọ ya, ha nwere ya.
The success of the song continues.	Ihe ịga nke ọma nke egwu ahụ gara n'ihu.
It's cold.	O nwere oyi.

I can imagine what he was thinking.	Enwere m ike iche ihe ọ na-eche.
There may be different ways to get it.	Enwere ike inwe ụzọ dị iche iche isi nweta ya.
He has authority.	O nwere ikike.
I owe a lot of money.	Eji m ụgwọ dị ukwuu.
Nice to see it.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ ya.

It is a happy spirit.	Ọ bụ mmụọ obi ụtọ.

Of course, there are some challenges.	N'ezie, e nwere ụfọdụ ihe isi ike.
No, you said the same thing.	Mba, i kwuru otu okwu.
But now is the time.	Ma ugbu a bụ oge.
He certainly knew well.	O doro anya na ọ maara nke ọma.
There are no questions in my life.	Enweghị ajụjụ ọ bụla na ndụ m.
Something went away from me.	Ihe si n'ebe m nọ pụọ.

Lower than land, of course.	Dị ala karịa ala, n'ezie.

Something scary.	Ihe na-atụ egwu.
My business almost stopped.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ahịa m kwụsịrị.
He took his time, he did not run.	O were oge ya, ọ naghị agba ọsọ.
He wants to go when he sees it.	Ọ na-achọ ịga mgbe ọ hụrụ ya.
The truth is clear.	Eziokwu doro anya.
I spent many days doing this, yesterday.	Eji m ọtụtụ ụbọchị m mee ihe a, ụnyaahụ.
No, there is no problem here.	Mba, enweghị nsogbu ebe a.

She is a good mother.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nne.
They know where the best time is to be.	Ha maara ebe oge kacha mma ga-adị.
A large lunch was provided at the house.	E nyere nnukwu nri ehihie n'ụlọ ahụ.

His house is simple.	Ụlọ ya bụ ihe dị mfe.

These are our two sons.	Ndị a bụ ụmụ anyị nwoke abụọ.

This can have many things.	Nke a nwere ike inwe ọtụtụ ihe.
But now he loves her.	Ma ugbu a, ọ hụrụ ya n'anya.
Let him tell you his story.	Ka ọ nye gị akụkọ ya.
It goes on and on.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu.
He was there.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ.
It’s a little bit smaller in it.	Ọ dị obere ka ọ dị obere n'ime ya.
The existence of work is a question of law.	Ịdị adị nke ọrụ bụ ajụjụ gbasara iwu.
Now help me here.	Ugbu a nyere m aka ebe a.
But it is not the same.	Ma ọ bụghị otu ihe ahụ.
The first two are true.	Ihe abụọ a mbụ bụ eziokwu.
The language is very clear.	Asụsụ ahụ doro nnọọ anya.
There is only one.	Enwere naanị otu.
It's a tough place.	Ọ bụ ebe siri ike.
I can't think that's good.	Enweghị m ike iche na nke ahụ dị mma.
They like to play small games.	Ha na-enwe mmasị igwu obere egwuregwu.
How long did it take you?	Kedu ihe were gị ogologo oge?
They work all day, every day.	Ha na-arụ ọrụ ụbọchị niile, ụbọchị ọ bụla.
He said he thought they should stay away, for a while.	O kwuru na ya chere na ha kwesịrị ịnọ ebe dị anya, nwa oge.
Some here, some in the city.	Ụfọdụ ebe a, ụfọdụ n'ime obodo.
We can not give them a job.	Anyị enweghị ike inye ha ọrụ.
No man can.	Ọ dịghị mmadụ nwere ike.
Suddenly, he realized that he had fallen in love with her.	Na mberede, ọ hụrụ na ya masịrị ya.
He knows it won't be long, now.	Ọ maara na ọ gaghị adị anya, ugbu a.
It was his worst fear.	Ọ bụ egwu ya kacha njọ.

That is what we really know.	Nke ahụ ka anyị maara n'ezie.
I do not know where it is.	Amaghị m ebe ọ dị.

He liked the game.	Egwuregwu ahụ masịrị ya.
But they never made me feel stupid.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe ha mere ka m nwee mmetụta onye nzuzu.
The fire is terrible.	Ọkụ ahụ dị egwu.

Get it from the staff.	Nweta ya n'aka ndị ọrụ.
Fire for feeling.	Ọkụ maka mmetụta.

There are three of them.	Enwere ha atọ.
It's a pleasure to have.	Ọ bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ inwe.
There is no room for power and fear.	Enweghị ohere maka ike na egwu.
All cars were stolen last year.	E zuru ụgbọ ala niile n'afọ gara aga.
Obviously the page of last year.	O doro anya na ibe nke afọ gara aga.

Probably one of the first to do this.	Ma eleghị anya, otu n'ime ndị mbụ mere nke a.
Many species do not know us.	Ọtụtụ ụdị dị ndụ amaghị anyị.
Some games, however, are about none of these things.	Ụfọdụ egwuregwu, Otú ọ dị, bụ banyere ọ dịghị nke ihe ndị a.
They run faster than they can run.	Ha na-agba ọsọ ọsọ karịa ka ha nwere ike ịgba ọsọ.

I hope you know that.	Enwere m olileanya na ị maara nke ahụ.
She feels like she is drowning.	Ọ dị ya ka mmiri na-eri ya.
If so, that's a good idea.	Ọ bụrụ otú ahụ, ọ bụ ezi echiche.
The electric machine is his eye.	Igwe ọkụ bụ anya ya.
In this picture, it may look good, but it is not.	Na foto a, ọ nwere ike ịdị mma, mana ọ bụghị.
No one knows where you are.	Ọ dịghị onye maara ebe ị nọ.
Because he can.	N'ihi na o nwere ike.
No human body.	Ahụghị ahụ mmadụ.
I do not know why, but it is.	Amaghị m ihe kpatara ya, mana ọ bụ ya.
The second he can do.	Nke abụọ o nwere ike ime.
I like that with a woman.	Nke ahụ na-amasị m na nwanyị.
That he did not.	Na o nweghị.
What it will be, it will be.	Kedu ihe ga-abụ, ọ ga-abụ.
It is the boat.	Ọ bụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
I would like one that will help me.	Ọ ga-amasị m nke ga-enyere m aka.
Your body, your law.	Ahụ gị, iwu gị.
The chief was angry.	Iwe were onye isi ahụ iwe.
In some countries, there are many others.	Ná mba ụfọdụ, ọtụtụ ndị ọzọ nọ.

Not all children are interested in vegetables.	Ọ bụghị ụmụaka niile nwere mmasị na akwụkwọ nri.

That is the point.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe.

Of course, no such letter could be necessary.	N'ezie, ọ dịghị akwụkwọ ozi dị otú ahụ nwere ike ịdị mkpa.
It was a great help and friend.	Ọ bụ nnukwu enyemaka na enyi.

Sometimes a person has to be strong.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, mmadụ kwesịrị ịdị ike.

We tried our best.	Anyị gbalịrị ihe niile anyị nwere ike iche.
The problem is that you do not do it.	Nsogbu bụ na ị naghị eme ya.
A way to get you to do whatever he wants you to do.	Ụzọ ọ ga-esi mee ka ị na-eme ihe ọ bụla ọ chọrọ ka ị mee.
We need bed linen.	Anyị chọrọ akwa akwa.
This is so much more than we can do.	Nke a karịrị nnọọ ihe anyị nwere ike ime.
But in this case it is not necessary.	Ma na nke a ọ dịghị mkpa.
And it runs awesome.	Na ọ na-agba ọsọ egwu.
That happened a lot during that time.	Nke ahụ mere ọtụtụ ihe n'oge ahụ.
They want the best for everyone, anywhere.	Ha na-achọ echiche kacha mma n'aka onye ọ bụla, ebe ọ bụla.
She thinks a little about her parents.	Ọ na-eche obere oge banyere nne na nna ya.
He kicked the ball.	Ọ gbara bọọlụ.

But yesterday was all that matters.	Ma ụnyaahụ bụ ihe niile dị mkpa.
But we never talked about food.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe anyị kwuru banyere nri.

At first it seemed like an act of violence.	Na mbụ ọ dị ka omume ime ihe ike.
Can't find it.	Enweghị ike ịhụ ya.
I was just waiting.	Anọ m na-eche naanị.
It happened, for a while.	O mere, ruo oge ụfọdụ.
Many people have strong fears.	Ọtụtụ ndị na-atụ egwu siri ike.
Anyway her parents are big.	Ọ bụla nnọọ ndị mụrụ ya ibu.

People are still talking about that now.	Ndị mmadụ ka na-ekwu maka nke ahụ ugbu a.
At first, we didn't think anything of it.	Na mbụ, anyị echeghị ihe ọ bụla banyere ya.
Staff will only do what they are told.	Ndị ọrụ ga-eme naanị ihe a gwara ha.
This is a good thing.	Nke a bụ ihe dị mma.

My mother was a reader.	Nne m bụ onye na-agụ ihe niile.

They live inside.	Ha bi n'ime.
The facts are as follows.	Eziokwu bụ ndị a.
This is just another case.	Nke a bụ naanị ikpe ọzọ.
So I left there.	M wee pụọ na ebe ahụ.
You will not be hungry then.	Ị gaghị enwe agụụ mgbe ahụ.
You need two simple things.	Ị chọrọ ihe abụọ dị mfe.
But it's hard, it's hard.	Mana ọ siri ike, siri ike.
Not sure if it works.	Ejighị n'aka ma ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
I have a lot of good teachers.	Enwere m ọtụtụ ezigbo ndị nkuzi.
But whether we play or not, that’s just the difference.	Mana ma anyị na-egwu egwu ma ọ bụ na anyị emeghị, nke ahụ bụ naanị ihe dị iche.
I do it all the time.	M na-eme ya mgbe niile.
If two things are different, they should have different names.	Ọ bụrụ na ihe abụọ dị iche, ha kwesịrị inwe aha dị iche iche.
It is a very cold night.	Ọ bụ abalị oyi nke ukwuu.
They all stopped.	Ha niile kwụsịrị.
His words are still true.	Okwu ya ka bụ eziokwu.
So tell me the truth.	Ya mere gwa m eziokwu.
He is the cause of all your troubles.	Ọ bụ ya kpatara nsogbu gị niile.
Okay ?.	Ọ dị mma?.
There are many reasons why they are there.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ha ji nọrọ ebe ahụ.
They took many medications, hoping they would get better.	Ha were ọtụtụ ọgwụ, na-atụ anya na ahụ ga-adị ha mma.
Who he knows, more or less.	Onye ọ maara, karịa ma ọ bụ obere.
It was the worst day of my life.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị kacha njọ ná ndụ m.
He will do anything.	Ọ ga-eme ihe ọ bụla.
It was a little funny.	Ọ bụ obere ọchị.
But the word is not new to me.	Ma okwu ahụ abụghị ihe ọhụrụ nye m.
But there is a lot of money.	Mana enwere oke ego.
Unsure whether it is the best idea or not.	Ejighị n'aka ma ọ bụ echiche kacha mma ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị.
For many years, he was a very successful actor.	Ruo ọtụtụ afọ, ọ bụ onye na-eme ihe nkiri na-aga nke ọma.
But it is still beautiful.	Ma ọ ka mara mma.
He looked at her quickly.	O lere ya anya ngwa ngwa.
It is a dead animal.	Ọ bụ anụ nwụrụ anwụ.
It really is something.	Ọ bụ n'ezie ihe.
Children do not want to go to school.	Achọghị ka ụmụaka gaa akwụkwọ.
Many doctors work long hours a week.	Ọtụtụ ndị dọkịta na-arụ ọrụ ogologo ụbọchị n'izu.
Then the second one.	Mgbe ahụ nke abụọ ya.
But big national money.	Ma nnukwu ego mba.

There are no negative effects.	Enweghị mmetụta dị njọ.
Do whatever you do.	Mee ihe ọ bụla ị na-eme.

He said it would not be long.	O kwuru na ya agaghị adị anya.
Or no power at all.	Ma ọ bụ enweghị ike ọ bụla.
You are worth more than anything.	Ị bara uru karịa ihe ọ bụla.
Make it what you want it to be.	Mee ya ihe ị chọrọ.
Every day after work.	Kwa ụbọchị mgbe ọrụ.
Keep the temperature high.	Mee ka okpomọkụ dị elu.
It should be.	Ọ kwesịrị ịbụ.
But he did better.	Ma o mere nke ọma karịa.
He is wise.	Ọ mara ihe.
It will be done.	A ga-eme ya.
He has a big hand.	O nwere nnukwu aka.
This is the most important point.	Nke a bụ isi ihe kacha mkpa.
He asked twice.	Ọ jụrụ ugboro abụọ.
Beautiful small photos.	Obere foto mara mma.
But before long.	Ma tupu ogologo oge.
I work fast.	M na-arụ ọrụ ngwa ngwa.
No need for planning.	Ọ dịghị mkpa maka atụmatụ.
This is a big challenge.	Nke a bụ nnukwu ihe ịma aka.
Probably the same as anything else here.	Ma eleghị anya, otu ihe ahụ dị ka ihe ọ bụla ọzọ ebe a.
It looks like a little disease.	Ọ dị ka ọrịa ntakịrị.
They will live.	Ha ga-adị ndụ.
It could be at home.	O nwere ike ịbụ n'ụlọ.
The game should be fun.	Egwuregwu kwesịrị ịdị ụtọ.

That should be the case.	Otú ahụ ka o kwesịrị ịdị.
The difference is due to the interest of the judges.	Ihe dị iche bụ n'ihi mmasị ndị ikpe.
I feel healthy.	Enwere m mmetụta nke ahụ ike.
Too bad.	Kwa onye ọjọọ.
I was feeling differently.	Anọ m na-enwe mmetụta dị iche iche.
No one thought it was good.	Ọ dịghị onye chere na ọ dị mma.
Here we are.	Ebe a ka anyị nọ.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ma eleghị anya, enwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
They want to make a movie about their child.	Ha chọrọ ime ihe nkiri gbasara nwa ha.

Many do it because land is cheap.	Ọtụtụ na-eme ya n'ihi na ala dị ọnụ ala.
At this time, in the next, in the next.	N'oge a, na nke ọzọ, na nke ọzọ.

But he really liked it.	Mana ọ masịrị ya n'ezie.
This is your job.	Nke a bụ ọrụ gị.
For example, how it happened.	Dị ka ihe atụ, otú o si mee.

And if it’s good, but it’s good, it works.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mma, ma ọ dị mma, ọ na-arụ ọrụ.

He liked the athlete's girlfriend.	Ọ masịrị enyi nwanyị onye egwuregwu ahụ.
It’s good but not a great movie.	Ọ dị mma mana ọ bụghị nnukwu ihe nkiri.
Doing so raises emotions.	Ime otú ahụ na-eme ka mmetụta uche dị elu.

Suddenly, the laughter subsided.	Na mberede, ọchị ahụ kwụsịrị.
She is terrified as a boy.	Ụjọ na-ama ya dị ka nwa nwoke.
For what my opinion is useful.	Maka ihe echiche m bara uru.
They like a new home.	Ụlọ ọhụrụ na-amasị ha.
You will not feel anything.	Ị gaghị enwe mmetụta ọ bụla.
She is one of the girls born on the same side.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ụmụ agbọghọ ndị a mụrụ na ibe.
The meeting will be held in ten minutes.	A ga-enwe nzukọ ahụ n’ime nkeji iri.

Almost everyone has visited his beloved place.	Ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ onye ọ bụla gara ebe a hụrụ ya n'anya.
The man is something else.	Nwoke ahụ bụ ihe ọzọ.
It’s fun, too, once.	Ọ dị ụtọ, kwa, otu ugboro.

Maybe he understood everything.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ ghọtara ihe niile.
Or when we are afraid.	Ma ọ bụ mgbe ụjọ na-atụ anyị.
But, if you want a good reason, this is it.	Ma, ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ ezi ihe kpatara ya, nke a bụ ya.

Of course, we have both.	N'ezie, anyị nwere ma na.

A smile spread across his face.	Ọmụmụ ọnụ ọchị gbasara n'ihu ya.

The villagers say the house was stolen.	Ndị obodo ahụ na-ekwu na e zuru ụlọ ahụ.
So make the best of them.	Ya mere mee ihe kacha mma n'ime ha.
There’s a lot in the game.	Ọtụtụ ihe dị na egwuregwu.

Then go for a run.	Mgbe ahụ gaa maka ịgba ọsọ.
This is your problem.	Nke a bụ nsogbu gị.
That was three months.	Nke ahụ bụ ọnwa atọ a.
The human reason is very important.	Ihe kpatara mmadụ dị oke mkpa.

Whatever is true is the reality of the present.	Ihe ọ bụla bụ eziokwu bụ eziokwu nke ugbu a.
However, that did not happen.	Otú ọ dị nke ahụ dara.
They do not have to be strong.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ịbụ ndị siri ike.

Or should it be.	Ma ọ bụ kwesịrị ịbụ.
He bought clothes in a supermarket.	Ọ zụtara uwe na nnukwu ụlọ ahịa.
Humans will not live.	Ụmụ mmadụ agaghị adị ndụ.

Everything looks like these pictures.	Ihe niile dị ka foto ndị a.

This is not like anywhere else.	Nke a adịghị ka ebe ọ bụla ọzọ.
The city has a good climate.	Obodo na-enwe ezigbo ihu igwe.

You know this is true.	Ị ma na nke a bụ eziokwu.

If you want to go, you have to go.	Ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ ịga, ị ga-aga.
It made him feel like he was another kid.	O mere ka ọ dị ya ka ọ bụ nwata ọzọ.

Trees, shrubs, and other trees.	Osisi, osisi, na osisi ndị ọzọ.

I want to see everything.	Achọrọ m ịhụ ihe niile.
Not a lot of fun is happening around here.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu obi ụtọ na-eme gburugburu ebe a.
Much of what he said is true.	Ọtụtụ ihe o kwuru bụ eziokwu.
This is very simple and cheap.	Nke a dị nnọọ mfe ma dị ọnụ ala.

Of course that would help.	N'ezie nke ahụ ga-enyere aka.
My only favorite is the wallet.	Naanị ihe na-amasị m bụ obere akpa.
The reason for this is unknown.	A maghị ihe kpatara nke a.
Just go there.	Naanị ịga ebe ahụ.
It will be so.	Ọ ga-adị otú ahụ.
Now we have two new models.	Ugbu a, anyị nwere ụdị ọhụrụ abụọ.
Thanks son.	Daalụ nwa nwoke.
She is wearing the perfect dress.	O yi uwe zuru oke.
What a great game with awesome music.	Kedu nnukwu egwuregwu nwere egwu dị egwu.
You have nowhere to go.	O nweghị ebe ị ga-aga.
But he will come here soon.	Mana ọ ga-abịa ebe a n'oge adịghị anya.
I can.	Enwere m ike.
I like that as a concept.	Enwere m mmasị na nke ahụ dị ka echiche.
It's good to be.	Ọ dị mma ibu.
At the same time they are relatively inexpensive.	N'otu oge ahụ ha dị obere ọnụ.
The fire is small.	Ọkụ dị obere.
No one here will do that.	Ọ dịghị onye ebe a ga-eme nke ahụ.
It happened a long time ago.	O mere ogologo oge gara aga.
Like a father like a son.	Dị ka nna dị ka nwa.
The application does not work anymore.	Ngwa ahụ anaghị arụ ọrụ ọzọ.
He will not talk to me.	Ọ gaghị agwa m okwu.
You have your hard core, but that’s not it.	Ị nwere isi ihe siri ike gị, mana ọ bụghị nke a.
We can achieve this.	Anyị nwere ike nweta nke a.
It will not go far.	Ọ gaghị aga ebe dị anya.
It's fun.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
The clock is a measure of time.	Igwe elekere bụ ngwa eji atụ oge.
But it is there.	Mana ọ dị ebe ahụ.
Lots of people here beautiful.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ebe a mara mma.
Whether you work or you are hungry.	Ma ị na-arụ ọrụ ma ọ bụ agụụ na-agụ gị.
To your right, one behind the other, are two cars.	N'aka nri gị, otu n'azụ nke ọzọ, ụgbọ ala abụọ dị.
I spent the morning walking into the room thinking.	M nọrọ n'ụtụtụ na-aga n'ime ụlọ na-eche echiche.
The best thing you can do is do it.	Ihe kacha mma i nwere ike ime bụ ihe i mere.
Take an idea.	Were otu echiche.
But there is a problem.	Ma enwere nsogbu.
I want to talk to you.	Achọrọ m ịgwa gị okwu.
The two met before the meeting, this person said.	Ha abụọ zutere tupu nzukọ ahụ, onye a kwuru.
Everyone is confident in each other.	Onye ọ bụla nwere obi ike na ibe ya.
And success he did.	Na ịga nke ọma o mere.
Anything can be there.	Ihe ọ bụla nwere ike ịdị n'ebe ahụ.
It's very simple.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe.
But he did not know it.	Ma ọ maghị ya.
He failed the final test.	Ọ dara ule ikpeazụ.
I like to talk.	Ọ na-amasị m ikwu okwu.
You can go out and do your own thing.	Ị nwere ike ịpụ mee ihe gị.
There are three ways to do this.	Enwere ụdị ụzọ atọ ebe a.
She looked at her husband.	O lere di ya anya.
No one knows what my clothes look like.	Ọ dịghị onye ma otú uwe m dị.
They should act immediately.	Ha ga-eme ihe ozugbo.
Travelers face a huge crowd.	Ndị na-eme njem na-eche oke oke mmadụ ihu.
You may have problems.	Ị nwere ike inwe nsogbu.
Just let me have these few days.	Naanị ka m nweta ụbọchị ole na ole ndị a.
The weather is very cold.	Ihu igwe dị ezigbo oyi.
No cars found.	Enweghị ụgbọ ala a hụrụ.
That is too serious.	Nke ahụ dị oke njọ.
But it is not far off.	Ma o nweghị ebe dị anya ọ ga-abịa.
I gotta Feeling.	Enwere m mmetụta.
This is how the truth is.	Nke a bụ otú eziokwu dị.
It would be futile to try to do only what we like.	Ọ ga-abụ ihe na-enweghị isi ime naanị ihe masịrị anyị.
It made me stop crying.	O mere ka m kwụsị ibe ákwá.
They are high on it.	Ha dị elu na ya.
He is, this, and everything.	Ọ bụ ya, nke a, na ihe ọ bụla.
On the other hand.	Na nke ọzọ.
The students will be young.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ahụ ga-abụ nwata.
It was just an accident.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe mberede.
It is weak, but it is stubborn.	Ọ dịghị ike, ma ọ dị isi ike.
Celebrities have it.	Ndị a ma ama nwere ya.
I told you a story.	Agwara m unu akụkọ.
This is not true.	Nke a abụghị eziokwu.
A lot of people go to the theater.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-aga ụlọ ihe nkiri.
Here is a small example of our work.	Nke a bụ obere ihe atụ nke ọrụ anyị.
As it is not difficult.	Dị ka ọ bụghị ihe siri ike.
How do you know if you are happy?	Kedu ka ị ga-esi mara ma ị nwere obi ụtọ?
I just told him to stop being stupid.	Naanị m gwara ya ka ọ kwụsị ịdị nzuzu.
The journey was difficult.	Ime njem ahụ siri ike.
Everyone in every city.	Onye ọ bụla n'ime obodo ọ bụla.
A different book.	Akwụkwọ dị iche.
It was a good day for him.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị dị mma maka ya.
This should be done here.	Ekwesịrị ime nke a ebe a.
That's not fair.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma.
That scared you.	Nke ahụ nyere gị ụjọ.
I want to help my team.	Achọrọ m inyere ndị otu m aka.
The effect is immediate.	Mmetụta ahụ bụ ozugbo.
The bad news.	Akụkọ ọjọọ ahụ.
You know those people.	Ị maara ndị ahụ.
He is afraid.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya.
We are not sure how it will be different.	Anyị ejighị n'aka ka ọ ga-esi dị iche.
I could not hold back simply because he was upset.	Enweghị m ike ịla azụ naanị n'ihi na iwe were ya.
Of course, our work was never required.	N'ezie, ọ dịghị mgbe achọrọ ọrụ anyị.
But it was really for me.	Ma n'ezie ọ bụ maka m.
Obviously some work is needed here.	O doro anya na achọrọ ụfọdụ ọrụ ebe a.
The day started off well	Ụbọchị ahụ malitere nke ukwuu
There are some opinions on that.	Enwere echiche ụfọdụ na nke ahụ.
They are user status.	Ha bụ ọnọdụ onye ọrụ.
The small room was cold and wet.	Obere ọnụ ụlọ ahụ dị oyi na mmiri.
We have a lot to do in the morning.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ ihe anyị ga-eme n’ụtụtụ.
Some behaviors will get worse within a few days.	Ụfọdụ agwa ga-adị njọ n'ime ụbọchị ole na ole.
But for the time being, it is what it is.	Ma maka oge a, ọ bụ ihe ọ bụ.
He is very interested.	O nwere nnọọ mmasị.
He does it well in his career, of course.	Ọ na-eme ya nke ọma na ọrụ ya, n'ezie.
It's like one of those games.	Ọ dị ka otu n'ime egwuregwu ndị ahụ.
I don't want anything.	Achọghị m ihe ọ bụla.
He is a good man.	Ọ bụ ya bụ ezigbo onye.
It would be of any value at that time.	Ọ ga-abụ uru ọ bụla ọ bara n'oge ahụ.
There are many roads in this city.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụzọ n'ime obodo a.
They are here.	Ha nọ ebe a.
We went to our staff.	Anyị gara ndị ọrụ anyị.
This is their strength.	Nke a bụ ike ha.
I say thank you.	Asị m daalụ.
This should be there.	Nke a kwesịrị ịbụ ebe ahụ.
I like the other one.	Ọ na-amasị m nke ọzọ.
Every day, there will be new doors.	Kwa ụbọchị, a ga-enwe ọnụ ụzọ ọhụrụ.
The music is fun.	Egwu ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
What! 	Kedu!
Every time the rain comes it will be fine.	Oge ọ bụla mmiri na-abịa ga-adị mma.
We are a little excited for our new machine ????.	Anyị nwere ntakịrị obi ụtọ maka igwe igwe ọhụrụ anyị????.
It looks like here.	Ọ dị ka ebe a.
Think it works well in the cold.	Chere na ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma na oyi.
Two children, girls.	Ụmụ abụọ, ụmụ agbọghọ.
The boat docked at the port.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ kwụsịrị n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
It feels good.	Ọ dị ya ka ọ̀ dị mma.
But they do suggest.	Ma ha na-atụ aro.
He does not want to know what happened to each of us.	Ọ chọghị ịma ihe mere onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị.
I am not alone.	Anaghị m anọ naanị m.
People surrounded him.	Ndị mmadụ gbara ya gburugburu.
This man can.	Nwoke a nwere ike.
All that horror.	Ihe egwu niile ahụ.
At the age of ten, he quit his job.	Mgbe ọ dị afọ iri, ọ kwụsịrị ọrụ ya.
That is what is in front of you right now.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe dị n'ihu gị ugbu a.
This is hard work but important.	Nke a bụ ọrụ siri ike mana ọ dị mkpa.
Give it to him.	Nye ya ya.
Two different methods were used.	Eji ụzọ abụọ dị iche iche mee ihe.
These are my mirrors.	Ndị a bụ enyo m.
There are three different types.	Enwere ụdị atọ dị iche iche.
He died within hours.	Ọ nwụrụ n'ime awa ole na ole.
They heard a song and saw a fire in the distance.	Ha nụrụ abụ ma hụ ọkụ n’ebe dị anya.
That does not happen.	Nke ahụ anaghị eme eme.
They are looking for companies that do good things.	Ha na-achọ ụlọ ọrụ ndị na-eme ihe ọma.
He pushed himself backwards.	O ji aka ya gaa n’azụ.
It makes me sick.	O mere m ọrịa ahụ́.
Tell them you like it.	Gwa ha na ọ masịrị gị.
We would like to use.	Anyị ga-achọ iji.
Give me a hug, please.	Nye m mma, biko.
I like it that way.	Ọ masịrị m otu ahụ.
Three people were at the police station that night.	Mmadụ atọ nọ n'ụlọ ọrụ ndị uwe ojii n'abalị ahụ.
This is important.	Nke a dị mkpa.
I am looking for a job.	Achọ m ọrụ.
Weak, but better.	Adịghị ike, mana ka mma.
Still, it is a weakness.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ bụ enweghị ike.
The food layer is delicious.	Nri oyi akwa bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
They would go to jail immediately if convicted.	Ha ga-aga mkpọrọ ozugbo ma ọ bụrụ na ha mara ha ikpe.
He had two or three children.	O nwere ụmụaka abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ.
You miss time.	Ị na-atụ uche oge.
He is still very much alive.	Ọ ka dị ndụ nke ukwuu.
I want more than I have.	Achọrọ m karịa ihe m nwere.
They can not believe it.	Ha apụghị ikweta.
Boy or girl?	Nwa nwoke ka ọ bụ nwa agbọghọ?
Two other girls were there.	Ụmụ agbọghọ abụọ ọzọ nọ n'ebe ahụ.
The bar is good.	Ụlọ mmanya dị mma.
It was fun and entertaining.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ ma na-atọ ọchị.
I love my dog.	Ahụrụ m nkịta m n'anya.
I love it !.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya!.
Just as he had.	Dị nnọọ ka o nwere.
It's not fair.	Ọ dịghị mma.
It seems that none of them are missing.	Ọ dị ka ọ dịghị onye ọ bụla n'ime ha na-atụ uche.
We can find them.	Anyị nwere ike ịchọta ha.
The place is clear to me.	Ebe ahụ doro m anya.
The baby was placed in his arms.	E tinyere nwa ahụ n'aka ya.
Everything was fine when it happened.	Ihe niile dị mma mgbe o mere.
He belongs to her.	Ọ bụ onye nke ya.
Others died at their ports.	Ndị ọzọ nwụrụ n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ha.
That is what my friend likes to say.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe enyi m nwere mmasị ikwu.
If so, do it.	Ọ bụrụ nke a, mee nke ahụ.
Simple place.	Ebe dị mfe.
The rest he said was just for the money.	Ndị ọzọ o kwuru na ọ bụ naanị maka ego ahụ.
But it is not that simple.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ahụ dị mfe.
There are both large and small.	Enwere ma nke ukwuu ma dị ntakịrị.
Then we left.	Mgbe ahụ anyị pụọ.
Please, get out of the way!	Biko, pụọ n'ụzọ!
He thought when he started it would look like this.	O chere na mgbe ọ malitere ọ ga-adị ka nke a.
Our next thing.	Ihe ọzọ anyị.
We do not see that often.	Anyị anaghị ahụ nke ahụ ọtụtụ mgbe.
The door is hard but.	Ọnụ ụzọ ahụ siri ike mana .
It does, it does.	Ọ na-eme, ọ bụ.
He took the opportunity to rest.	O ji ohere ahụ zuru ike.
He began to think about leaving.	Ọ malitere iche echiche ịpụ.
Those people have feelings.	Ndị ahụ nwere mmetụta.
But he did something different.	Ma o mere nke dị iche.
There is a good reason.	Enwere ezi ihe kpatara ya.
But she faces challenges.	Ma ọ na-eche ihe ịma aka ihu.
I have a girl to help.	Enwere m nwa agbọghọ iji nyere aka.
The colors are beautiful.	Agba ndị ahụ mara mma.
This time it is different.	Oge a ọ dị iche.
Funny thing, too.	Ihe na-atọ ọchị, kwa.
Of course you have a point there.	N'ezie ị nwere isi ebe ahụ.
They feel that they are not there.	Ọ dị ha ka ha anọghị ebe ahụ.
He did not want to be with her.	Ọ chọghị ka ya na ya nọrọ.
Other points are hard.	Isi ndị ọzọ siri ike.
You have parents who make it their own children.	Ị nwere ndị nne na nna na-eme ya ụmụ nke ha.
He will not be the last.	Ọ gaghị abụ onye ikpeazụ.
But they are just stories.	Ma ha bụ naanị akụkọ.
That's the thing.	Ọ bụ ihe ahụ.
They speak for the truth.	Ha na-ekwu maka eziokwu.
She talked about her son.	O kwuru banyere nwa ya nwoke.
He knows the place well.	Ọ ma ebe ahụ nke ọma.
Law is law.	Iwu bụ iwu.
But again, things are not so easy.	Ma ọzọ, ihe adịghị mfe otú ahụ.
Are you male or female?	Ị bụ nwoke ka ọ bụ nwanyị?
But they can do nothing.	Ma ha enweghị ike ime ihe ọ bụla.
They feel they are doing something backwards.	Ọ dị ha ka ha na-eme ihe azụ.
I think you will be happy to see it.	Echere m na obi ga-adị gị ụtọ ịhụ ya.
There is a way to get there from here.	Enwere ụzọ ọ bụla isi si ebe a gaa ebe ahụ.
Ask everyone to do their best not to judge.	Gwa onye ọ bụla ka ọ mee ike ya ka ọ ghara ikpe ihe ọ bụla.
Of course not.	O doro anya n'ezie.
It is what they want.	Ọ bụ ihe ha chọrọ.
That doesn't really matter.	Nke ahụ enweghị isi n'ezie.
I know what it will be.	Amaara m ihe ọ ga-abụ.
I do well every day though.	Ana m eme nke ọma kwa ụbọchị n'agbanyeghị.
Not fast, not fast.	Ọ bụghị ngwa ngwa, ọ bụghị ngwa ngwa.
It seems like everyone was thinking this.	Ọ dị ka onye ọ bụla nọ na-eche nke a.
Take another drink.	Were mmanya ọzọ.
I let it happen.	M kwere ka ọ mee.
This city is a country.	Obodo a bụ mba.
Of course, many have doubts about our existence.	N'ezie, ọtụtụ ndị na-enwe obi abụọ banyere ịdị adị anyị.
I don't care how old he is.	Achọghị m ịma afọ ole ọ dị.
The reason is simple.	Ọ dị mfe ihe kpatara ya.
Or you may like to do it.	Ma ọ bụ ọ ga-amasị gị ime.
The accident could happen to anyone.	Ihe mberede ahụ nwere ike ime onye ọ bụla.
At times, she enjoyed it.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ na-atọ ya ụtọ.
Or someone else.	Ma ọ bụ onye ọzọ.
His heart is strong.	Obi ya siri ike.
It is not a debt.	Ọ bụghị ụgwọ.
He identified himself with the newspaper.	O ji akwụkwọ akụkọ mara onwe ya.
I don’t know how to get it.	Amaghị m ka m ga-esi nweta ya.
Which is great.	Kedu nke dị mma.
Man up, baby.	Nwoke elu, nwa.
He could not get it quickly.	O nweghị ike nweta ya ngwa ngwa.
I love it so much thanks !!.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya nke ukwuu daalụ!!.
Or you may need to do something else.	Ma ọ bụ ọ pụrụ ịdị mkpa ka i mee ihe ọzọ.
They do not matter.	Ha adịghị mkpa.
Of course, we cannot do anything at all.	N'ezie, anyị enweghị ike ime ụdị ihe ọ bụla.
We are ready to do that.	Anyị dị njikere ime nke ahụ.
But you can do them.	Ma ị nwere ike ime ha.
Practice works well, no matter what you do.	Omume na-eme nke ọma, n'agbanyeghị ihe ị na-eme.
He sat down.	Ọ nọdụ ala.
I like that.	Enwere m mmasị na nke ahụ.
Therefore, the path should be the same.	Ya mere, ụzọ kwesịrị ịdị otu.
He refused to speak until authorized.	Ọ jụrụ ikwu okwu ruo mgbe e nyere ya ikike.
Good celebrities will love it.	Ezigbo ndị ama ama ga-enwe mmasị na ya.
They are afraid of him.	Ha tụrụ ya ụjọ.
No truth can be compared to truth.	Ọ dịghị eziokwu yiri eziokwu.
A car can carry more than 40 people.	Ụgbọ ala nwere ike ibu ihe karịrị mmadụ iri anọ.
Whether or not, it's up to you.	Ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị, ọ dị gị n'aka.
Others went to help them at home.	Ndị ọzọ gara nyere ha aka n’ụlọ.
But this is really good.	Mana nke a dị mma n'ezie.
They want money, he thought.	Ha chọrọ ego, o chere.
Others do bad things.	Ndị ọzọ na-eme ihe na-adịghị mma.
What a good idea.	Kedu ezigbo echiche.
They do not work.	Ha anaghị arụ ọrụ.
Like two years ago.	Dị ka afọ abụọ gara aga.
I do not want to go to the bar.	Achọghị m ịla n'ụlọ mmanya.
Our leader is a courageous person.	Onye isi anyị bụ onye obi ike.
It's tough.	O siri ike.
Now you are a good financier.	Ugbu a ị bụ ezigbo ndị isi ego.
This in itself is not a big deal.	Nke a n'onwe ya abụghị nnukwu ihe.
This can happen.	Nke a nwere ike ime.
Only cold water.	Naanị mmiri oyi.
After eating.	Mgbe iri nri.
They are both strong.	Ha abụọ siri ike.
There is no hospital nearby.	Enweghị ụlọ ọgwụ dị nso.
Old-fashioned anger at everything.	Iwe iwe oge ochie na ihe niile.
So we stayed.	Ya mere, anyị nọrọ.
Cold weather and apathy.	Ọnwa na-atụ oyi na enweghị mmasị.
Now go as fast as you can.	Ugbu a gaa ngwa ngwa ka i nwere ike.
Everyone knows it and the truth.	Ndị niile maara ya ma eziokwu.
He was amazed at her beauty.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya maka ịma mma ya.
We love them, have two of those.	Anyị hụrụ ha n'anya, nwere abụọ n'ime ndị ahụ.
A can be considered as a "high letter".	Enwere ike were A dị ka "akwụkwọ ozi dị elu".
Our idea succeeds in this.	Echiche anyị na-aga nke ọma na nke a.
We need each other.	Anyị chọrọ ibe anyị.
He asked me about many things.	Ọ jụrụ m banyere ọtụtụ ihe.
Or, you can go for it.	Ma ọ bụ, ị nwere ike ịga maka ya.
Everyone was running then.	Onye ọ bụla na-agba ọsọ mgbe ahụ.
There is still much to do.	A ka nwere ihe ha kwesịrị ime.
It was tough at the time.	Ọ siri ike n'oge ahụ.
I think you did.	Echere m na ị mere.
All the music you want, when you want it and where you want it.	Egwu niile ịchọrọ, mgbe ịchọrọ na ebe ịchọrọ.
His best friend couldn’t help it in this.	Ezigbo enyi ya enweghị ike inye aka na nke a.
Lots and lots of ideas.	Ọtụtụ na ọtụtụ echiche.
So they hurried off.	Ha wee were ọsọ pụọ.
My children are eating.	Ụmụ m na-eri nri.
The trial lasted several months.	Ikpe ahụ were ọnwa ole na ole.
We drink coffee and talk.	Anyị na-aṅụ kọfị na-ekwu okwu.
I think this letter is good.	Echere m na akwụkwọ ozi a dị mma.
I haven't thought of it since.	Echeghị m ya kemgbe ahụ.
It is either the case that it works or not.	Ọ bụ ma ikpe ahụ ọ na-arụ ọrụ ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị.
That is my daily routine.	Nke ahụ bụ ụzọ m kwa ụbọchị.
Get this easy.	Nweta nke a mfe.
It does not run very well.	Ọ naghị agba ọsọ ọsọ nke ọma.
Let's have dinner now.	Ka anyị rie nri abalị ugbu a.
Still, it is good that it is happening at all.	N'agbanyeghị, ọ dị mma na ọ na-eme ma ọlị.
That is, if people like to use them in that way.	Ya bụ, ọ bụrụ na ọ na-amasị ndị mmadụ iji ha mee ihe otú ahụ.
It may not be necessary to tell them now.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị adị mkpa ma ị gwa ha ugbu a.
Of course, my brother could be my best friend.	N'ezie, nwanne m nwoke nwere ike ịbụ ezigbo enyi m.
Impact and judgment.	Mmetụta na ikpe.
These can be expensive.	Ndị a nwere ike ịdị ọnụ.
It was an incredible trip, because no one was there at that time.	Ọ bụ njem na-enweghị atụ, n'ihi na ọ dịghị onye gara ebe ahụ n'oge ahụ.
That's what your anger says.	Nke ahụ bụ iwe gị na-ekwu.
He loves the woman he loves.	Ọ hụrụ nwanyị ọ hụrụ n'anya.
He spent all his money on nothing.	O ji ego ya niile mee ihe na-adịghị mkpa.
Some people are happy.	Ụfọdụ ndị nwere obi ụtọ.
That is nothing new.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe ọhụrụ.
What is it? 	Kedu ihe ọ bụ?
he asked.	ọ jụrụ.
It really makes sense.	Ọ bụ ezi uche n'ezie.
You know, as you like.	Ị mara, dị ka ọ masịrị gị.
At my house.	N'ụlọ m.
My opinion is small.	Echiche m dị ntakịrị.
We only want names.	Anyị na-achọ naanị aha.
I will not tell you about it.	Agaghị m agwa gị gbasara ya.
His family rejected the girl.	Ezinụlọ ya jụrụ nwa agbọghọ ahụ.
He is sure.	O ji ihe n'aka.
They are not like anything.	Ha adịghị ka ihe ọ bụla.
This is my beloved son.	Nke a bụ nwa m nwoke m hụrụ n'anya.
It is not good news.	Ọ bụghị ozi ọma.
Then came this.	Mgbe ahụ wee a.
It won't be long.	Ọ gaghị adị ogologo oge.
The truth is that he cannot see the door.	Eziokwu bụ na ọ nweghị ike ịhụ ọnụ ụzọ.
You really do.	Ị na-eme n'ezie.
But then the point comes.	Ma mgbe ahụ, isi ihe na-abịa.
Perhaps they realized that they were hungry.	Ma eleghị anya, ha ghọtara na agụụ na-agụ ha.
It’s not just what I do.	Ọ bụghị naanị ihe m na-eme.
He knew that, if anyone did it.	Ọ maara nke ahụ, ọ bụrụ na onye ọ bụla mere ya.
Not everyone in the area liked it.	Ndị niile bi ebe ahụ enweghị mmasị na ya.
The children love them.	Ụmụaka hụrụ ha n'anya.
A time of history for people.	Oge akụkọ ihe mere eme maka ndị mmadụ.
He does not know what to do now.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ ga-eme ugbu a.
However, finding them is difficult.	Otú ọ dị, ịchọta ha siri ike.
They never did anything.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha mere ihe ọ bụla.
Some of us are unique.	Ụfọdụ n'ime anyị pụrụ iche.
No customer service at all.	Enweghị ọrụ ndị ahịa ma ọlị.
I'm talking about children.	M na-ekwu maka ụmụaka.
The meeting was called to order.	A kpọrọ nzukọ ahụ ka o nye iwu.
Twice.	Ugboro abụọ.
It's really raining now.	Ọ bụ n'ezie mmiri ugbu a.
No, he was confident.	Mba, obi siri ya ike.
Things are good here.	Ihe dị mma ebe a.
For me, that would be impossible.	Nye m, nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume.
It appeals to kids.	Ọ na-amasị ụmụaka.
Not in people's hearts.	Ọ bụghị n'obi ndị mmadụ.
Or anyone.	Ma ọ bụ onye ọ bụla.
They didn't see anything, of course.	Ha ahụghị ihe ọ bụla, n'ezie.
He said he was successful.	O kwuru na ọ gara nke ọma.
But who needs it.	Ma onye chọrọ ya.
They look like me.	Ha yiri m nke ọma.
Why the question is good.	Gịnị kpatara ajụjụ ji dị mma.
It will be smaller than required.	Ọ ga-adị obere karịa ka achọrọ.
He blamed them.	O chere na ọ bụ ya kpatara ha.
No questions about it.	Enweghị ajụjụ gbasara ya.
You know others.	Ị maara ndị ọzọ.
I know you are going on with the story.	Ama m na ị na-aga n'ihu na akụkọ.
You have my words.	Ị nwere okwu m.
Pork is a cheap meat.	Anụ ezi bụ anụ dị ọnụ ala.
Let's stop this nonsense.	Ka anyị kwụsị okwu nzuzu a.
Everything, this time.	Ihe niile, oge a.
But he can't wait for the full story.	Mana ọ nweghị ike iche maka akụkọ zuru oke.
There may be little truth in that.	Enwere ike inwe ntakịrị eziokwu na nke ahụ.
He’s a good handler, maybe he makes sense.	Ọ bụ aka ochie, ma eleghị anya ọ nwere ezi uche.
Just let the music be there.	Naanị ka egwu nọrọ ebe ahụ.
Driving will be faster.	Ịnya ụgbọ ala ga-adị ngwa ngwa.
About the family.	Banyere ezinụlọ.
I really miss him.	A na m atụ uche ya n'ezie.
Tears welled up in his eyes.	Anya mmiri dị ya n'anya.
He came to love us.	Ọ bịara ka anyị hụ ya n’anya.
But everything is still there.	Mana ihe niile ka dị.
He looked looking down.	O lere anya na-achọ ala.
But that would not be good.	Mana nke ahụ agaghị adị mma.
Hard to say right now.	O siri ike ikwu ugbu a.
However, he was surprised.	Otú ọ dị, ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.
I do not understand this question.	Aghọtaghị m ajụjụ a.
I did not know him at the time.	Amaghị m ya n’oge ahụ.
Again, the small ones.	Ọzọ, ndị dị obere.
Because you are a man.	N'ihi na ị bụ nwoke.
I know you do.	Ama m na ị na-eme ya.
But for a while, he had it.	Ma ruo oge ụfọdụ, o nwere.
But sometimes it is.	Ma mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ bụ eziokwu.
So is our financial strength.	Otú ahụ ka ike ego anyị si dị.
He was a heavy drinker.	Ọ bụ onye na-aṅụ mmanya.
I'm still waiting for you.	M ka na-eche gị.
He put his hand on his heart.	O tinyere aka ya n’obi ya.
He was waiting for her.	Ọ nọ na-eche ya.
I knew right away.	Amaara m ozugbo.
The beach here is perfect for summer.	Osimiri ebe a dị mma maka oge okpomọkụ.
The righteous are your friends.	Ndị ezi omume bụ ndị enyi gị.
Tell me what you want.	Gwa m ihe ị chọrọ.
It's like a test.	Ọ dị ka ule.
That took planning.	Nke ahụ were ime atụmatụ.
They can’t do that, can they?	Ha enweghị ike ime nke ahụ, ha nwere ike?
I do not know how.	Amaghị m otú.
When you get there, everything looks like in this picture.	Mgbe ị rutere ebe ahụ, ihe niile dị ka na foto a.
You can not get out of this.	Ị nweghị ike ịpụ na nke a.
But it is still there.	Ma ọ ka dị ebe ahụ.
I think it’s my time.	Echere m na ọ bụ oge m.
We will be there.	Anyị ga-anọ ebe ahụ.
I had two major events then.	Enwere m ihe omume abụọ bụ isi mgbe ahụ.
The family lives in a large house.	Ezinụlọ ahụ bi n’otu nnukwu ụlọ.
He hated his life.	Ọ kpọrọ ndụ ya asị.
Not in these.	Ọ bụghị na ndị a.
But it may not be.	Ma o nwere ike ọ gaghị adị.
I have a cold.	Enwere m oyi.
They can say anything.	Ha nwere ike ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
There is no way.	Ọ dịghị ụzọ ọ bụla.
Sit down, baby.	Nọdụ ala, nwa.
Many of my friends want to use it.	Ọtụtụ ndị enyi m chọrọ iji ya.
Maybe he doesn't hear me.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ naghị anụ m.
.Ka.	Ụka.
It was a winter holiday.	Ọ bụ izu ụka ezumike n'oge oyi.
I think they are a good thing.	Echere m na ha bụ ihe dị mma.
Our unity is our strength.	Ịdị n'otu anyị bụ ike anyị.
I can see one reason for that may be here.	Enwere m ike ịhụ otu ihe kpatara nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ ebe a.
Minimum.	Nke kacha nta.
Just a bed.	Naanị akwa.
I need money to buy food.	Achọrọ m ego iji zụta nri.
That's their style.	Nke ahụ bụ ụdị ha.
No words.	Enweghị okwu.
I have a question about things.	Enwere m ajụjụ gbasara ihe.
He can use another knife.	O nwere ike iji mma ọzọ.
What time will it be?	Kedu oge ọ ga-abụ?
But today we will do that.	Ma taa, anyị ga-eme nke ahụ.
For me it really works.	Maka m ọ na-arụ ọrụ n'ezie.
That is what the authorities do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ndị isi na-eme.
The effect is minimal.	Mmetụta dị ntakịrị.
Both were purchased.	A zụtara ha abụọ.
He fired with one hand.	O ji otu aka were were ọkụ.
I am the father of my son.	Abụ m nna nwa m nwoke.
There is no point in going there.	Enweghị uru ịga ebe ahụ.
We don’t like it ourselves, but we want money.	Anyị enweghị mmasị na ya n'onwe anyị, mana anyị chọrọ ego.
It burns.	Ọ na-agba ọkụ.
They are not just bad.	Ha abụghị naanị ihe ọjọọ.
That is what the city wants.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe obodo a chọrọ.
We are in beautiful hands.	Anyị nọ n'aka mara mma.
What he said was not true.	Ihe o kwuru abụghị eziokwu.
Here, you can see for yourself.	Ebe a, ị nwere ike ịhụ onwe gị.
They live in high places.	Ha bi n'ebe dị elu.
He asked his student if he wanted to go to lunch.	Ọ jụrụ nwa akwụkwọ ya ma ọ̀ chọrọ ịga rie nri ehihie.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ọ dịghị ihe adịghị njọ.
I tried to do something.	M gbalịrị ime ihe.
The best ever.	Nke kacha mma mgbe ọ bụla.
The second is money.	Nke abụọ bụ ego.
This is not a difficult challenge.	Nke a abụghị ihe ịma aka siri ike.
His mind is strong.	Uche ya siri ike.
All ideas have the same weight.	Echiche niile nwere otu ibu.
There is a good reason.	Ọ nwere ihe mere nke ọma.
You do it well.	Ị na-eme ya nke ọma.
We can find it.	Anyị nwere ike ịchọta ya.
But we didn't know that at the time.	Ma anyị amaghị nke ahụ n’oge ahụ.
We are one, but different.	Anyị bụ otu, ma iche.
One of the many similar cities.	Otu n'ime ọtụtụ obodo ndị yiri ya.
First, it is not true.	Nke mbụ, ọ bụghị eziokwu.
Nothing serious.	Ọ dịghị mkpa.
Of course he had money.	N'ezie o nwere ego.
I'm not going home.	Agaghị m ala n'ụlọ.
I love this city.	Ahụrụ m obodo a n'anya.
Or the second.	Ma ọ bụ nke abụọ.
This makes for a great lunch or dinner.	Nke a na-eme nri ehihie mara mma ma ọ bụ nri nri abalị.
If the function does not work properly.	Ọ bụrụ na ọrụ anaghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
We can't go far.	Anyị enweghị ike ịga ebe dị anya.
Ideal for school and sports.	Ezigbo maka ụlọ akwụkwọ na egwuregwu.
Things would have been worse.	Ihe gaara aka njọ.
But there are still a few people involved.	Ma a ka nwere ndị mmadụ ole na ole gbasara.
Both should be police statements.	Abụọ kwesịrị ịbụ okwu uwe ojii.
Someone did this.	Mmadụ mere nke a.
But anyone who does so is not the key.	Ma onye ọ bụla na-eme ya otú ahụ abụghị isi ihe.
After all they’ve got, this is a small matter.	Mgbe ihe niile ha nwetara, nke a bụ obere okwu.
There is no way back.	Enweghị ụzọ azụ.
To judge.	Ime ikpe.
I feel very good.	Ọ dị m mma nke ukwuu.
Whatever you want to call them.	Ihe ọ bụla ị chọrọ ịkpọ ha.
He did not want to talk to any of his relatives.	Ọ chọghị ịgwa onye ọ bụla n’ime ndị ikwu ya okwu.
He is a worker.	Ọ bụ onye ọrụ.
Once you want another question.	Ozugbo ịchọrọ ajụjụ ọzọ.
There is little more to say.	Ọ dị ntakịrị ihe ọzọ ikwu.
That could be fine.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịdị mma.
He should see it coming, of course.	Ọ kwesịrị ịhụ na ọ na-abịa, n'ezie.
I do not know what is best.	Amaghị m ihe kacha mma.
That is the difference.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe dị iche.
It keeps them alive.	Ọ na-eme ka ha dị ndụ.
Maybe a little bit.	Ma eleghị anya, ntakịrị ntakịrị.
Which surprised me.	Nke tụrụ m n'anya.
Everyone knows it.	Onye ọ bụla maara ya.
The countryside lacks insects in a dramatic way.	Ime obodo enweghị ụmụ ahụhụ n'ụzọ dị egwu.
Maybe it's time of year.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ oge nke afọ.
They planned a family vacation by the beach.	Ha mere atụmatụ ezumike ezinụlọ n'akụkụ osimiri.
I have two questions about that.	Enwere m ajụjụ abụọ gbasara nke ahụ.
That was the case with most sailors.	Otú ahụ ka ọtụtụ ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri mere.
The case is useful in this case for a variety of reasons.	Ikpe ahụ bara uru na nke a maka ihe dị iche iche.
No one else can.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ nwere ike ịma.
So he died.	Ya mere ọ nwụrụ.
She is my favorite.	Ọ bụ onye kacha amasị m.
Stop them! 	Kwụsị ha!
Or so it should be.	Ma ọ bụ otú o kwesịrị.
I love you more than you are my man.	Ahụrụ m gị n'anya karịa ka ị bụ nwoke m.
It is loved by loved ones.	Ọ na-amasị ndị a hụrụ n'anya.
He does not allow me to do things.	Ọ naghị ekwe ka m na-eme ihe.
What is the biggest challenge facing the city?	Kedu otu nnukwu nsogbu na-eche obodo ahụ ihu?
It is something a person can do or cannot do.	Ọ bụ ihe mmadụ nwere ike ime ma ọ bụ enweghị ike ime.
I think about this pretty solid.	M na-eche banyere nke a mara mma siri ike.
I called him and talked to him.	M kpọrọ ya ma gwa ya okwu.
And that is very important, that is very important.	Na nke ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa, nke ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa.
Most of it.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
That is a spirit.	Nke ahụ bụ mmụọ.
Not good for travel.	Ọ dịghị mma maka njem.
It will be made of wood.	A ga-eji osisi ahụ mee ya.
He’s alive, and perfect to talk about.	Ọ dị ndụ, ma zuru oke ikwu okwu.
I don't think there is anything we can do other than that.	Echeghị m na ọ dị ihe ọzọ anyị nwere ike ime karịa nke ahụ.
Someone who goes somewhere, does something.	Onye na-aga ebe, na-eme ihe.
We do not want it.	Anyị achọghị ya.
He likes it all.	O nwere mmasị na ya niile.
Stay in your room.	Nọrọ n'ime ụlọ gị.
That's right- she seems to be happy, she's happy.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu, o yiri ka ọ nwere obi ụtọ, ọ nwere obi ụtọ.
Today everyone is doing that.	Taa onye ọ bụla na-eme nke ahụ.
It is worse than anyone thought.	Ọ dị njọ karịa ka onye ọ bụla chere.
She watched him go.	O lere ya ka ọ na-aga.
I see no reason why you should not act that way.	Ahụghị m ihe kpatara na ị gaghị eme ihe n'ụzọ ahụ.
We will help them.	Anyị ga-enyere ha aka.
I'm sure it will go well.	Eji m n'aka na ọ ga-eme nke ọma.
But that doesn't matter.	Ma nke ahụ adịghị mkpa.
They are not yet.	Ha abụghị ma.
Feelings of hunger can be felt whenever they are close.	Enwere ike inwe mmetụta nke agụụ mgbe ọ bụla ha nọ nso.
He thought of his wife, the way he loved her.	O chere banyere nwunye ya, otú o si hụ ya n'anya.
Many such things.	Ọtụtụ ihe dị otú ahụ.
We are human and stay in this together.	Anyị bụ mmadụ ma nọrọ na nke a ọnụ.
This allowed us to work as long as possible.	Nke a mere ka anyị na-arụ ọrụ ruo ogologo oge o kwere mee.
Whatever you like.	Ihe ọ bụla masịrị gị.
He loved the feeling of winter.	Ọ hụrụ n'anya nke ukwuu mmetụta nke oyi.
What is it !.	Kedu ihe ọ bụ!.
Thirty years without a girlfriend.	Afọ iri atọ na enweghị enyi nwanyị.
Do you have a good weekend?	Ị nwere ezigbo izu ụka?
That was a very difficult situation to play.	Nke ahụ bụ ọnọdụ siri nnọọ ike igwu egwu.
I have so much to do.	Enwere m ọtụtụ ihe ime.
Bad people are good.	Ndị ọjọọ dị mma.
About the ship.	Banyere ụgbọ mmiri.
They know him well.	Ha maara ya nke ọma.
I have a good friendship with them.	Mụ na ha na-enwe ezigbo enyi.
He is here and enjoys the project.	Ọ nọ ebe a ma nwee mmasị na ọrụ ahụ.
The truth is strong.	Eziokwu siri ike.
I know you can't talk about it.	Ama m na ị nweghị ike ikwu maka ya.
Then it takes a long time.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ chọrọ ogologo oge.
Now it was flooded.	Ugbu a nnukwu mmiri juru ebe ahụ.
But of course it is awesome too.	Ma n'ezie ọ dị egwu kwa.
I don't like anything.	Enweghị m mmasị na ihe ọ bụla.
It happens over and over again.	Ọ na-eme ugboro ugboro.
I am not afraid of your daughter.	Anaghị m atụ egwu nwa gị nwanyị.
Here is the message.	Nke a bụ ozi ahụ.
This is very good.	Nke a dị ezigbo mma.
We seem to know how to play each other.	O yiri ka anyị maara ka ibe anyị ga-esi egwu egwu.
You can go around it, on a day trip.	Ị nwere ike ịga gburugburu ya, na njem ụbọchị.
Obviously you are not shopping.	O doro anya na ị naghị azụ ahịa.
That was for my father.	Nke ahụ bụ maka nna m.
It will be three.	Ọ ga-abụ atọ.
Everything he said was true.	Ihe niile o kwuru bụ eziokwu.
I have to go.	Aga m agba.
Time.	Oge.
These can be beautiful on their own.	Ndị a nwere ike ịbụ ihe mara mma n'onwe ha.
The room and bed are very nice.	Ime ụlọ na akwa dị mma nke ukwuu.
But there is more.	Ma e nwere ihe ọzọ o kwuru.
Because it works part-time.	N'ihi na ọ na-arụ ọrụ nwa oge.
Football game.	Egwuregwu bọọlụ.
We do not need to be afraid.	Anyị agaghị atụ ụjọ.
I'm not here for fun.	Anọghị m ebe a maka okwu ọchị.
My last night ended just a few hours earlier.	Abalị m gara aga kwụsịrị naanị awa ole na ole tupu mgbe ahụ.
It’s always a good book.	Ọ bụ ezigbo akwụkwọ mgbe niile.
We will live here.	Anyị ga-adị ndụ ebe a.
He is happy.	Obi dị ya ụtọ.
The situation quickly deteriorated.	Ọnọdụ ahụ dara ngwa ngwa.
He was my helper in good times and in difficult times.	Ọ bụ onye enyemaka m n'oge dị mma na nke siri ike.
More time.	Oge ka ukwuu.
He plays games.	Ọ na-egwu egwuregwu.
Come on, there's dinner.	Bịa, enwere nri abalị.
She looked back.	Ọ tụrụ ya anya n’azụ.
Of course the buildings are still there.	N'ezie ụlọ ndị ahụ ka dị.
I look forward to playing with both hands at the moment.	M na-atụ anya iji aka abụọ na-egwu oge ahụ.
The phone rang.	Ekwentị ekwe ntị dara.
And this is a lot of fun.	Na nke a bụ ọtụtụ ihe ọchị.
There are so many.	E nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
But he was surprised.	Ma, o juru ya anya.
We left the fire.	Anyị hapụrụ ọkụ.
We do not want.	Anyị achọghị.
Thanks to the book, much.	N'ihi akwụkwọ, ukwuu.
That made him taller than anyone else.	Nke ahụ mere ka ọ dị elu karịa onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
Psalms and more.	Abụ Ọma na ndị ọzọ.
This is a true story.	Nke a bụ akụkọ eziokwu.
No one else.	Ọ dịghị onye ọzọ.
Children think that everyone is bad.	Ụmụaka na-eche na onye ọ bụla bụ́ onye ọjọọ dị nnọọ njọ.
Mothers know this very well.	Ụmụ nwanyị mụrụ nwa maara nke a nke ọma.
It just will not happen.	Naanị agaghị eme.
We all want more.	Anyị niile chọrọ karịa.
He looked around the house.	O lere anya gburugburu ụlọ ahụ.
They are so good.	Ha dị mma nke ukwuu.
I hope it will make it bigger.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ ga-eme ya nnukwu.
Obviously no more.	O doro anya na ọ dịghị mkpa ka ukwuu.
I love them both.	Ahụrụ m ha abụọ n'anya ọnụ.
Many of these are easy to access.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị a dị mfe iji nweta.
When he left the bar.	Mgbe ọ hapụrụ ụlọ mmanya ahụ.
As usual the tower was high.	Dị ka ọ dị na mbụ ụlọ elu dị elu.
They know what they know.	Ha maara ihe ha maara.
He soon became interested.	Ọ malitere inwe mmasị n'oge na-adịghị anya.
It is possible, but a little pointless.	O kwere omume, mana ntakịrị enweghị isi.
I'll be close.	Aga m anọ nso.
She has her own person.	O nwere onye ya.
She is ready for anything.	Ọ dị njikere maka ihe ọ bụla.
She does not like it.	Ọ naghị adị ya mma.
I like boys.	Ụmụ nwoke na-amasị m.
See my previous post.	Hụ okwu m gara aga.
They should have.	Ha kwesịrị inwe.
The children love it.	Ụmụaka hụrụ ya n'anya.
I like them.	Enwere m mmasị na ha.
I'm very sorry.	Ọ dị m nwute nke ukwuu.
I saw a story this morning.	Ahụrụ m otu akụkọ n'ụtụtụ a.
They do not want to know their old room.	Ha achọghị ịma ime ụlọ ochie nke ha.
But he is not the only one we should join.	Ma ọ bụghị onye anyị kwesịrị iso.
It's not fair.	Ọ dịghị mma.
And what they are now.	Na ihe ha nọ ugbu a.
One person was badly burned.	Otu onye gbara ezigbo ọkụ.
It happens for the last month.	Ọ na-eme maka ọnwa gara aga.
Different colors are available.	Agba dị iche iche dị.
Individuals have rights.	Ndị mmadụ n'otu n'otu nwere ikike.
However, that is not the last question.	Otú ọ dị, ma ọ bụghị ya ka bụ ajụjụ gara aga.
You are not immortal.	Ị bụghị anwụ anwụ.
Both in the same way.	Ha abụọ n'otu ụzọ.
I will not do it, no matter what.	Agaghị m eme ya, n'agbanyeghị ihe.
Therefore, there are popular problems.	Ya mere, enwere nsogbu ndị a ma ama.
I have a lot of books.	Enwere m ọtụtụ akwụkwọ.
People don't care.	Ndị mmadụ achọghị ịma.
It is a city and a house.	Ọ bụ obodo na ụlọ.
We are still doing things.	Anyị ka na-eme ihe.
Suddenly, he was furious.	Na mberede, iwe were ya.
These are things we know we know.	Ihe ndị a bụ ihe anyị maara na anyị maara.
There is no date in the back.	Enweghị ụbọchị na azụ.
He knew right away that it would not work.	Ọ maara ozugbo na ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ.
Would you like to go with me?	Ọ ga-amasị gị iso m gaa?
Take 30 minutes.	Were nkeji iri atọ.
It happened last week.	O mere n'izu gara aga.
Your little talk.	Obere okwu nzuzu gị.
The four of us.	Anyị anọ.
Only one you heard.	Naanị otu ka ị nụrụ.
But it is worse than that.	Ma ọ ka njọ karịa nke ahụ.
But in that moment, they want your eyes.	Ma n'oge ahụ, ha chọrọ anya gị.
The main thing is that it is fun.	Isi ihe bụ na ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
Otherwise, we have to get out.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, anyị kwesịrị ịpụ.
It was about a decade ago.	Ọ bụ ihe dị ka afọ iri gara aga.
I am still a student.	M ka bụ nwata akwụkwọ.
The students asked many questions during the lesson.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ahụ jụrụ ọtụtụ ajụjụ n'oge nkuzi ahụ.
I am enthusiastic.	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu.
But here we have a different situation.	Ma ebe a anyị nwere ọnọdụ dị iche.
Or not, until last night.	Ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị, ruo n'abalị ikpeazụ.
It is no longer sweet.	Ọ dịghị ụtọ ọzọ.
He is a stubborn man.	Ọ bụ nwoke nwere isi ike.
Stay close.	Nọrọ nso.
He did what they wanted to do.	O mere ihe ha chọrọ.
Or at least, not absolute truth.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, ọ bụghị eziokwu zuru oke.
I have no children.	Enweghị m ụmụ.
Face to face with the object.	Ihu na ihu na ihe ahụ.
We know now that we can.	Anyị maara ugbu a na anyị nwere ike.
I have a feeling of being alone because of that.	Enwere m mmetụta nke ịnọ naanị ya n'ihi nke ahụ.
He heard a kind of singing.	Ọ nụrụ ụdị abụ abụ.
They are beautiful.	Ha mara mma.
He did this as quickly as before.	O mere nke a ngwa ngwa dị ka nke mbụ.
These things are too great to be done.	Ihe ndị a dị oke na enweghị ike ime ya.
Thanks, man.	Daalụ, nwoke.
There is no certainty in this life.	Ọ dịghị ihe doro anya na ndụ a.
Everyone was scared.	Ụjọ tụrụ onye ọ bụla.
The eyes are small	Anya ahụ dị obere
It may be other things as we work.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe ndị ọzọ ka anyị na-arụ ọrụ.
Kind of wants it, too.	Ụdị chọrọ ya, kwa.
I do not know when.	Amaghị m oge ọ bụ.
No one believed him.	Ọ dịghị onye kwere ya.
Give food.	Nye nri.
And we go.	Na anyị na-aga.
They have a friend.	Ha nwere enyi.
By itself, that is not a real problem.	N'onwe ya, nke ahụ abụghị ezigbo nsogbu.
Much better than before.	Ọtụtụ mma karịa na mbụ.
But the tutorial has more value than that.	Ma nkuzi ahụ nwere uru ka ukwuu karịa nke ahụ.
This meeting will take place tomorrow.	Nzukọ a ga-eme echi.
Really makes you want to go there !.	N'ezie na-eme ka ị chọọ ịga ebe ahụ !.
There we are now.	Ebe ahụ ka anyị nọ ugbu a.
Probably a number of such ones are still alive today.	Ma eleghị anya, ọtụtụ ndị dị otú ahụ ka dị ndụ taa.
We are free, able to do whatever we want.	Anyị nwere onwe anyị, nwee ike ime ihe ọ bụla anyị chọrọ.
Go somewhere else.	Gaa ebe ọzọ.
This boy is hungry.	Nwa nwoke a na-agụ agụụ.
It is a difficult fact.	Ọ bụ eziokwu siri ike.
He seemed to be expecting me.	O yiri ka ọ nọ na-atụ anya m.
What a beautiful thing for a beautiful thing.	Kedu ihe mara mma maka ihe mara mma.
You owe them nothing.	Ị ji ha ụgwọ ọ bụla.
Others are here.	Ndị ọzọ nọ ebe a.
For anything really.	Maka ihe ọ bụla n'ezie.
Therefore, such garments may be waiting for the employee.	Ya mere, uwe ndị dị otú ahụ nwere ike ịdị na-eche onye ọrụ.
The work was hopeless.	Ọrụ ahụ enweghị olileanya.
Apparently, his evil eye looked at him.	Dị ka ọ dị, anya ọjọọ ya lere anya na ya.
I should be more angry, maybe.	Ekwesịrị m iwe karịa, eleghị anya.
That's really nice.	Nke ahụ dị mma n'ezie.
He was young.	Ọ bụ nwata.
Only next time.	Naanị mgbe ọzọ.
Or be happy.	Ma ọ bụ na-enwe obi ụtọ.
Good thing to do.	Ezigbo ihe na-eme ihe.
Many say that nothing can be done.	Ọtụtụ ndị na-ekwu na ọ dịghị ihe a pụrụ ime.
Within the first week, things went well.	N'ime izu mbụ, ihe dị mma.
To his delight, there were two messages.	N'ime obi ụtọ ya, e nwere ozi abụọ.
I doubt he loves me very much.	Enwere m obi abụọ na ọ hụrụ m n'anya nke ukwuu.
If nothing else.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ nweghị ihe ọzọ.
They made me look like a fool.	Ha mere ka ọ dị m ka onye nzuzu.
Do what you do.	Na-eme ihe ị na-eme.
I need your help for it.	Achọrọ m enyemaka gị maka ya.
No one was there.	O nweghị onye nọ ebe ahụ.
It is almost one of them now.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ otu n'ime ha ugbu a.
I can't do that now.	Enweghị m ike ime nke ahụ ugbu a.
More than that, every day, games are played on their own.	Karịa nke ahụ, kwa ụbọchị, a na-enwe egwuregwu n'onwe ha.
This is more important to me.	Nke a dị m mkpa karịa.
They have a plan.	Ha nwere atụmatụ.
Now is the time to act.	Ugbu a bụ oge ime ihe.
Certainly not.	O doro anya na ọ bụghị.
Many foreigners visit this port.	Ọtụtụ ndị mba ọzọ na-aga ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri a.
Your teacher left a long time ago.	Onye nkuzi gị hapụrụ ogologo oge.
The traveler was amazed at the beauty of the city.	Mma obodo ahụ juru onye njem ahụ anya.
It just happened.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe merenụ.
I can't do it.	Enweghị m ike ime ya.
You read this, don't you?	Ị na-agụ nke a, ọ bụghị gị?
He had no children on the way.	O nweghị nwa n'ụzọ.
There is no other situation with that.	Enweghị ọnọdụ ọzọ na nke ahụ.
Language is important.	Asụsụ dị mkpa.
You made yourself a fool in front of everyone.	I mere onwe gị onye nzuzu n'ihu mmadụ niile.
Where no one can see.	Ebe ọ dịghị onye pụrụ ịhụ.
It looks like one by one.	Ọ dị ka otu na otu.
It seemed like a lot at the time.	Ọ dị ka ọtụtụ ihe n'oge ahụ.
No one will be able to help you in this.	Ọ dịghị onye ga-enyere gị aka na nke a.
It will be your strength from now on.	Ọ ga-abụ ike gị site ugbu a gaa n'ihu.
It's a good game.	Ọ bụ egwuregwu dị mma.
He saw two.	Ọ hụrụ abụọ.
It’s the only way it always works.	Ọ bụ naanị ụzọ na-arụ ọrụ mgbe niile.
In some ways.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
But then, in a matter of minutes, he died.	Ma mgbe ahụ, n'ime oge nke nkeji, ọ nwụrụ.
He is in his room.	Ọ nọ n'ime ụlọ ya.
We will be able to do this.	Anyị ga-enwe ike ime nke a.
Both are successful.	Abụọ ndị a mechara nke ọma.
And those around you are waiting.	Na ndị nọ gị nso na-eche ya.
It works for me.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka m.
I know where they are.	Ama m ebe ha nọ.
Work and beautiful food.	Ọrụ na nri mara mma.
Police provided gifts for anyone with information.	Ndị uwe ojii nyere onyinye maka onye ọ bụla nwere ozi.
I was in the same situation.	Anọ m n'otu ọnọdụ ahụ.
You can't have an idea next to my mind.	Ị nweghị ike inwe uche n'akụkụ uche m.
After the first two months it works well.	Mgbe ọnwa abụọ mbụ ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
That’s why we felt like it was this morning.	Ọ bụ ya mere na ọ dị anyị ka ọ bụ n'ụtụtụ a.
I still have a lot of money at the moment.	M ka nwere nnukwu ego n'oge a.
I do not want to be alone.	Achọghị m ịnọ naanị m.
You will have that.	Ị ga-enwe nke ahụ.
You take it.	Ị were ya.
Some children like to be alone.	Ụfọdụ ụmụaka na-enwe mmasị ịnọ naanị ha.
He said that would be nice.	O kwuru na nke ahụ ga-adị mma.
Hear me.	Nụrụ m.
Otherwise, it does not matter.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ dịghị mkpa.
We were looking for something different.	Anyị nọ na-achọ ihe dị iche.
But do a lot of things.	Ma mee ọtụtụ ihe.
Our enjoyment continues unabated.	Ụtọ anyị na-aga n'ihu na-enweghị isi.
It will help us.	Ọ ga-enyere anyị aka.
For your own sake.	Maka oke nke onwe gị.
The next day.	Ụbọchị ọzọ mere.
Again, no problem.	Ọzọ, nsogbu adịghị.
This will be your hot spot.	Nke a ga-abụ gị ọkụ ọkụ.
Everyone knows about them.	Onye ọ bụla maara banyere ha.
I need to use better words.	Ekwesịrị m iji okwu ka mma.
Not the police, not the police.	Ọ bụghị ndị uwe ojii, ọ bụghị ndị uwe ojii.
His talk was very enjoyable.	Okwu ya na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
I am only human.	Abụ m naanị mmadụ.
All of us.	Anyị niile.
He wanted it to be bad.	Ọ chọrọ ka ọ dị njọ.
He was very angry when he arrived.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu mgbe o rutere.
During that year, the boy had many friends.	N'ime afọ ahụ, nwa nwoke ahụ nwere ọtụtụ ndị enyi.
He was very much loved.	A hụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
With her mouth.	Ya na ya ọnụ.
He looked down on his friend.	O lere enyi ya anya ọjọọ.
It's hard, but young.	O siri ike, mana nwata.
Out of service.	Ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
When two is negative it makes things better.	Mgbe abụọ adịghị mma na-eme ka ihe dị mma.
But you don't want to call it quits.	Ma ị chọghị ịkpọ ya.
Year of the season.	Afọ nke oge.
There is no doubt about it.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya.
They are few.	Ha dị ole na ole.
You can see this for yourself very quickly.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ nke a n'onwe gị ngwa ngwa.
I'll tell you in a few minutes.	Aga m agwa gị n'ime nkeji ole na ole.
That day was not long ago, probably.	Ụbọchị ahụ abụghị ogologo oge gara aga, eleghị anya.
Up and back.	Elu na azụ.
Eat lunch together.	Rie nri ehihie ọnụ.
But that's not all.	Ma ọ bụghị ihe niile.
The team has some ideas that these places can go.	Ndị otu ahụ nwere ụfọdụ echiche na ebe ndị a nwere ike ịga.
He really said it.	O kwuru ya n'ezie.
They belong to him and to him.	Ha bụ nke ya na n'ime ya.
Nice to see you again.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ gị ọzọ.
What a homelessness here.	Kedu ihe ọ bụ enweghị ụlọ n'ebe a.
I do not know what they did to him.	Amaghị m ihe ha mere ya.
Interesting as this is.	Na-atọ ụtọ ka nke a dị.
We loved those activities.	Anyị nwere mmasị n'ihe omume ndị ahụ.
The customer goes ahead of the boat.	Onye ahịa ahụ na-aga n'ihu ụgbọ mmiri ahụ.
At first, he did not want to move forward.	Na mbụ, ọ chọghị ịga n'ihu.
As he never wanted anything.	Dị ka ọ dịghị mgbe ọ chọrọ ihe ọ bụla.
This seems to work.	Nke a yiri ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
But it should be done !.	Mana ekwesịrị ime ya!.
It's very stupid.	Ọ bụ nnọọ nzuzu.
By practice, they can be influenced.	Site na omume, enwere ike inwe mmetụta ha.
No action is possible.	Ọ dịghị omume bụ omume.
However, his work did not pose a challenge.	Otú ọ dị, ọrụ ya adịghị enwe ihe isi ike ya.
But there is more.	Ma e nwere ọtụtụ ihe.
They will be more willing to help.	Ha ga-adị njikere karịa inye aka.
Just stay inside and disappear now.	Naanị nọrọ n'ime na pụọ ​​​​n'anya ugbu a.
Of course, it is very different.	N'ezie, ọ dị nnọọ iche.
Value works fast.	Uru na-arụ ọrụ ngwa ngwa.
He was angry.	O were iwe.
He entered the nearest town.	Ọ banyere n'ime obodo kacha nso.
In fact, the reason is this.	Nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ, gịnị kpatara e ji mee nke a.
This city is known for its great theaters.	A maara obodo a maka nnukwu ụlọ ihe nkiri.
I want to say.	Achọrọ m ikwu.
No, no, no.	Mba, mba, mba.
Now get out of here.	Ugbu a pụọ ​​ebe a.
His idea is his own.	Echiche ya bụ nke ya.
However, we do.	Otú ọ dị, anyị na-eme ya.
We need to rest.	Anyị kwesịrị izu ike.
Then he saw something in the distance.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ hụrụ ihe n'ebe dị anya.
My wife will never be happy.	Obi agaghị adị nwunye m ụtọ ma ọlị.
And he vanished.	O wee pụọ n'anya.
People are important to our community.	Ndị mmadụ dị mkpa maka obodo anyị.
They know they should not do it.	Ha ma na ha ekwesịghị ime ya.
This is a bad practice.	Nke a bụ omume adịghị mma.
You have a gift for such things.	Ị nwere onyinye maka ihe ndị dị otú ahụ.
Or a demon.	Ma ọ bụ mmụọ ọjọọ.
If you love your country more.	Ọ bụrụ na ị hụrụ obodo gị n'anya karịa.
He liked it.	Ọ masịrị ya.
I can’t but not do it.	Enweghị m ike ma ọ bụghị ime ya.
He used it the other way.	O ji ya na-aga n'ụzọ ọzọ.
We are in the top ten.	Anyị nọ n'ime iri.
The study continues.	Ọmụmụ ihe na-aga n'ihu.
So you are my mother.	Ya mere, ị bụ nne m.
He fell last.	Ọ dara nke ikpeazụ.
Or, as it were.	Ma ọ bụ, dị ka ọ dị.
She is survived by three children.	Ọ hapụrụ ụmụ atọ.
But let us assume that these limits are there.	Ma ka anyị were na oke ndị a dị.
I'd like to talk to him today.	Ọ ga-amasị m ịgwa ya okwu taa.
I think they are like actors.	Echere m na ha dị ka ndị na-eme ihe nkiri.
Because we believe it, we believe you.	N'ihi na anyị kwere ya, anyị kwere gị.
Those without food.	Ndị na-enweghị nri.
He had a sense of humor.	O nwere mmetụta ọchị.
But the big question.	Ma, nnukwu ajụjụ.
I know his children.	Ama m ụmụ ya.
They make me feel like a parent.	Ha dị m ka nne na nna.
This is what he does.	Nke a ka o mere.
You can not say much about the cause of the bow.	Ị nweghị ike ikwu ọtụtụ ihe gbasara ụta kpatara.
It is really useful.	Ọ bara uru n'ezie.
He is running fast.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ ọsọ.
The car stopped at the bus stop.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ kwụsịrị n'ọdụ ụgbọ ala.
Where is this place?	Kedu ebe ebe a bụ.
He is sitting alone.	Ọ nọ ọdụ naanị ya.
I love it.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya.
I hope that happens but you never know.	Enwere m olileanya na nke ahụ ga-eme mana ị maghị.
He could see the same man.	O nwere ike ịhụ otu nwoke ahụ.
Very well.	Ọ dị mma nke ukwuu.
A fire broke out in the city.	Ọkụ gbara n'ime obodo ahụ.
Not himself.	Ọ bụghị ya onwe ya.
These things are not easy to find.	Ihe ndị a adịghị mfe ịchọta.
So far, however, you have felt alive.	Otú ọ dị, ruo ugbu a, ọ dị gị ka ị dị ndụ.
He ate his feet.	O riri ụkwụ ya.
Then it does not work.	Mgbe ahụ ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
It is very difficult.	Ọ siri nnọọ ike.
But it is their city.	Mana ọ bụ obodo ha.
She told her mother on the phone today.	Ọ gwara nne ya na ekwentị taa.
I do not know now what happened to him.	Amaghị m ugbu a ihe mere ya.
His feelings should not be negative.	Mmetụta ya ekwesịghị ịbụ nke na-adịghị mma.
My opinion is not a challenge.	Echiche m abụghị ihe ịma aka.
It's more beautiful.	Ọ mara mma karịa.
This practice is extremely dangerous.	Omume a dị oke egwu.
His family's hopes were dashed.	Echiche ezinụlọ ya kwụsịrị.
Not the length of time you do the exercise, but how often.	Ọ bụghị ogologo oge ị na-eme ihe, mana ugboro ole.
The first could not find a word.	Nke mbụ enweghị ike ịhụ okwu.
So they waited for the dog.	Ya mere, ha chere nkịta.
The staff is very friendly and obviously loves children and their work.	Ndị ọrụ nwere ezigbo enyi na o doro anya na hụrụ ụmụaka na ọrụ ha n'anya.
But that doesn’t work anymore.	Mana nke ahụ anaghị arụ ọrụ ọzọ.
he was surprised.	o juru ya anya.
However, there is another reason.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ihe ọzọ kpatara ya.
Get out of the house.	Si n'ụlọ pụọ.
This hall is for sports.	Ụlọ Nzukọ a bụ maka egwuregwu.
And in that first year.	Na n'afọ mbụ ahụ.
It will be there.	Ọ ga-adị ebe ahụ.
But there is hope.	Ma olileanya dị.
Many patients see no benefit.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọrịa ahụghị uru ọ bụla.
Anything.	Ihe ọ bụla.
It's cheap.	Ọ dị ọnụ ala.
Far from it, of course.	N'ebe dị anya site na ya, n'ezie.
The object has a name.	Ihe ahụ nwere aha.
Personal income.	Ọnụ ego nke onwe.

They stayed a long time.	Ha nọrọ ogologo oge.
We can really know things.	Anyị nwere ike ịma ihe n'ezie.
I'm not telling you what you are.	Anaghị m agwa gị ihe ị bụ.
Or my job.	Ma ọ bụ ọrụ m.
Let's go.	Ka anyị pụọ.
I'm sure they understood that.	Eji m n'aka na ha ghọtara nke ahụ.
But only in the flesh, as it were.	Ma naanị na anụ ahụ, dị ka ọ dị.
It is not good to be seen together.	Ọ bụghị ihe dị mma ka a hụ anyị ọnụ.
I want my own event.	Achọrọ m ihe omume nke onwe m.
There is no one like him.	Ọ dịghị onye dị ka ya.
You are not expected.	A naghị atụ anya gị.
He will come to your home.	Ọ ga-abịa n'ụlọ gị.
It’s like dancing, just fast.	Ọ dị ka ịgba egwu, naanị ngwa ngwa.
He went as fast as he could.	Ọ gara ngwa ngwa ka o nwere ike.
I think the letter.	Echere m akwụkwọ ozi ahụ.
Or love one another.	Ma ọ bụ hụrụ ibe gị n'anya.
At least that is what he said.	Ma ọ́ dịghị ihe ọzọ, nke ahụ bụ ihe o kwuru.
But this is not good.	Mana nke a adịghị mma.
I suggest they take ours.	M na-atụ aro ka ha were nke anyị.
But that is not good.	Ma nke ahụ adịghị mma.
The first game of the game was me.	Egwuregwu mbụ nke egwuregwu ahụ bụ m.
That’s what we want, of course.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị chọrọ, n'ezie.
I will not let you stop him talking.	Agaghị m ekwe ka ị kwụsị ya okwu.
He wanted to go to the countryside.	Ọ chọrọ ịga ime obodo.
They can do nothing.	Ha enweghị ike ime ihe ọ bụla.
Go on with your day and whatever happens, do it.	Gaa n'ihu na ụbọchị gị na ihe ọ bụla na-eme, mee.
Everyone loves it.	Ọ na-amasị onye ọ bụla ịhụ ya n'anya.
I love being around the event.	Ọ na-agụ m agụụ ịnọ gburugburu ihe omume ahụ.
Or something to do, for that matter.	Ma ọ bụ ihe na-eme, maka nke ahụ.
He will be here in the next hour.	Ọ ga-abịa ebe a n'ime awa ọzọ.
This is your situation.	Nke a bụ ọnọdụ gị.
Teacher.	Onye nkuzi.
Obviously, that was not the case.	O doro anya na ụzọ ahụ adịghị mma.
I was cold inside and I wasn’t.	Enwere m oyi n'ime na enweghị m.
We are waiting for the news.	Anyị na-eche akụkọ.
He looked out the window.	O lere anya na windo.
This seems to have happened many years ago.	Nke a yiri ka ọ mere ọtụtụ afọ gara aga.
I can find them.	Enwere m ike ịchọta ha.
That is not the case.	Ihe adịghị otú ahụ.
It is their job to do this.	Ọ bụ ọrụ ha ime nke a.
You can not use it for anything.	Ị nweghị ike iji ya mee ihe ọ bụla.
He asked a question.	Ọ jụrụ ajụjụ.
What is being said is “stupid”.	Ihe a na-ekwu bụ "ihe nzuzu".
It is good with the baby.	Ọ dị mma na nwa ahụ.
He asked me to see him here alone.	Ọ gwara m ka m hụ ya ebe a naanị ya.
One thing is just one of them.	Otu ihe bụ naanị otu n'ime ya.
My daughter is wearing her school uniform.	Nwa m nwanyị yi uwe ụlọ akwụkwọ ya.

The lady of the house was young.	Nwanyị ụlọ ahụ bụ nwata.

And family, of course.	Na ezinụlọ, n'ezie.
During our vacation, we visited two ancient cities.	N'oge ezumike anyị, anyị gara obodo abụọ oge ochie.
You want the best for your people with the least amount of money.	Ịchọrọ ndị gị ihe kacha mma na obere ego.

With no phone.	Na enweghị ekwentị.
For some reason he does not do that.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ ọ naghị eme nke ahụ.
It was authorized.	E nyere ya ikike.
He told her to stay longer.	Ọ gwara ya ka ọ nọrọ ogologo oge.

It is important that you understand this situation.	Ọ dị mkpa na ị ghọtara ọnọdụ a.

It is important that the water is not too hot.	Ọ dị mkpa na mmiri ahụ adịghị ọkụ nke ukwuu.
The name of the place is well said.	Aha ebe ahụ kwuru nke ọma.
I do not know your parents.	Nne na nna gị amaghị m.

But this law has nothing to do with the case before us.	Mana iwu a enweghị ihe ọ bụla gbasara ikpe dị n'ihu anyị.

Or so it is.	Ma ọ bụ otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
But that is a small thing.	Ma nke ahụ bụ obere ihe.
We do not do such things.	Anyị anaghị eme ihe ọ bụla dị otú ahụ.

He’s a big guy, he’s strong, he’s strong.	Ọ bụ nnukwu mmadụ, ọ dị ike, ọ siri ike.
But now, get out.	Ma ugbu a, pụọ.
Only once did he meet her.	Naanị otu ugboro ka ọ zutere ya.

Of course, sometimes they just don't want to see me.	N'ezie, mgbe ụfọdụ, ha anaghị achọ ịhụ m.
These are two important points.	Ihe a bụ isi ihe abụọ dị mkpa.
He is not a handsome man.	Ọ bụghị nwoke mara mma.
Whatever company it is, it needs to be discontinued.	Ụlọ ọrụ ọ bụla ọ bụ, ọ dị mkpa ka a kwụsị ya.
Something else is not right.	Ihe ọzọ adịghị mma.
Know yourself and your actions.	Mara onwe gị na omume gị.

He is the strongest of them both.	Ọ bụ ya ka ike n'ime ha abụọ.
I think there are two things.	Echere m na enwere ihe abụọ.
That would be him, he thought.	Nke ahụ gaara abụ ya, ka o chere.
The search for more lives continues.	A na-aga n'ihu na-achọ ndụ ndị ọzọ.
In them he saw two little thoughts about himself.	N'ime ha ọ hụrụ ntakịrị echiche abụọ banyere onwe ya.
So he gave them some.	Ya mere, o nyere ha ụfọdụ.
Everything is as it should be.	Ihe niile dị ka o kwesịrị ịdị.
Which is your favorite?	Kedu nke kacha amasị gị?.
But it is very true.	Ma ọ bụ nnọọ eziokwu.
It was nice and handy.	Ọ dị mma na aka.
This is what he wants.	Nke a bụ ihe ọ chọrọ.
That did not make our name known, but we did not care.	Nke ahụ emeghị ka aha anyị mara anyị, ma anyị achọghị ịma.
They are not healthy.	Ọ bụghị ha ahụ́.
The weather is very nice.	Ihu igwe dị ụtọ nke ukwuu.
But that is not what they wanted.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị ihe ha chọrọ.

Age action at work.	Afọ omume na-arụ ọrụ.
It is a busy morning.	Ọ bụ ụtụtụ ọrụ n'aka.

One day, however.	Otú ọ dị, otu ụbọchị.
He tries to talk.	Ọ na-agbalị ikwu okwu.
Not for what matters.	Ọ bụghị maka ihe dị mkpa.
Great job, but not.	Nnukwu ọrụ, ma ọ bụghị.
So the idea of ​​this book was born.	Ya mere a mụrụ echiche nke akwụkwọ a.

Each one has different weapons.	Nke ọ bụla nwere ngwa ọgụ dị iche iche dị na ya.

Large companies have great potential.	Nnukwu ụlọ ọrụ na-enwe nnukwu ike.
They never asked questions.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha jụrụ ajụjụ.
He was about his father's age.	Ọ dị ihe dị ka afọ nna ya.
As a result, our community yearned for the truth.	N'ihi ya, obodo anyị na-agụ agụụ eziokwu.
People were angry.	Ndị mmadụ were ha iwe.
That is a lie.	Nke ahụ bụ ụgha.
The last movie was beautiful.	Ihe nkiri ikpeazụ mara mma.
None of this is for our benefit.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a bụ maka anyị.

The song was stopped.	A kwụsịrị ịbụ abụ ahụ.
We are lovers.	Anyị bụ ndị hụrụ.
But, well, that's a different person.	Ma, ọ dị mma, nke ahụ bụ onye dị iche.

Some expect you to do it.	Ụfọdụ na-atụ anya na ị ga-eme ya.
Nothing serious.	Ọ dịghị mkpa.
The children are terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ ụmụaka ahụ.
He is looking forward to a new era.	Ọ na-atụ anya oge ọhụrụ.
Of course, it is an old story.	N'ezie, ọ bụ akụkọ ochie.
The people who drank there liked it.	Mmanya ya masịrị ndị nọ n'ebe ahụ.
But something happened there where it fell.	Mana ihe mere ebe ahụ ebe ọ dara.
Good thing, by the way.	Ihe dị mma, n'ụzọ.
It was a lot of violence.	Ọ bụ ọtụtụ ime ihe ike.
Something very small.	Ihe nwere ntakịrị ibu ya.
But that is what I like.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe masịrị m.
Maybe girls do this, too.	Ma eleghị anya, ụmụ agbọghọ na-eme nke a, kwa.

The study consisted of two groups.	Ọmụmụ ihe ahụ nwere otu abụọ.

He looked at his phone.	O lere ekwentị ya anya.
But not really because they do bad things.	Ma ọ bụghị n'ezie n'ihi na ha na-eme ihe ọjọọ.
It's too bad.	Ọ dị nnọọ njọ.
There is no way to make money.	Enweghị ụzọ isi nweta ego.
In fact, it was almost a joke.	N'ezie, ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ihe ọchị.
No, it does matter.	Mba, o nwere isi ihe.

However, the cause was not understood.	Otú ọ dị, aghọtaghị ihe kpatara ya.

It seems good that I have a little girl.	O yiri ka ọ dị mma na m nwere obere nwa nwanyị.
She is confident that her son is confident.	Obi siri ya ike na nwa ya nwoke nwere obi ike.
That is my plan for today.	Nke ahụ bụ atụmatụ m maka taa.
It came to me that we could help them.	Ọ bịara m na anyị nwere ike inyere ha aka.

He was amazed at the magnitude of the colors.	Otú agba ndị ahụ si dị ukwuu tụrụ ya n’anya.

Of course, they are different people.	N'ezie, ha bụ ndị dị iche iche.

Everything about it is awesome.	Ihe niile gbasara ya dị oke egwu.
The fight is my life.	Ọgụ ahụ bụ ndụ m.

Of course, there is a reason for that.	N'ezie, e nwere ihe kpatara nke ahụ.
I'll be working tonight.	Aga m arụ ọrụ n'ime abalị a.
Two or three have a knife each and one has a stick.	Abụọ ma ọ bụ atọ nwere mma nke ọ bụla na otu nwere osisi.
In this he knows that he himself is one.	Na nke a ọ maara na ya onwe ya bụ otu.
It’s just that everyone wants to be his friend.	Ọ bụ naanị na onye ọ bụla chọrọ ịbụ enyi ya.
One thing is for sure.	Otu ihe na nke a.
He did something.	O mere ihe.
That is, until now.	Ya bụ, ruo ugbu a.
Everything is his story.	Ihe niile bụ akụkọ ya.
I play his game for my own game.	M na-egwu egwuregwu ya maka egwuregwu nke m.
The length of the trial can take up to three years.	Ogologo ikpe ikpe nwere ike were afọ atọ.
He looked at her twice.	O lere ya ugboro abụọ.

The most important thing is that they are there.	Ihe kacha mkpa bụ na ha nọ ebe ahụ.

Very pretty, she thought.	Mara mma nke ukwuu, o chere.
Everything seems to be fine.	Ihe niile dị ka ọ dị mma.
But we know more than they do.	Ma, e nwere ihe ndị anyị maara karịa ka ha na-eme.
I think it is now.	Echere m na ọ bụ ugbu a.
He would not want it to be this way.	Ọ gaghị achọ ka ọ dị otú a.
You have everything.	Ị nwere ihe niile.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
You can see the kids at school.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ụmụaka na ụlọ akwụkwọ.
But he wanted to say something.	Ma ọ chọrọ ikwu otu ihe.
It doesn't work, nothing works.	Ọ naghị arụ ọrụ, ọ nweghị ihe na-arụ ọrụ.
Of course, the truth is different.	N'ezie, eziokwu dị iche.

I liked everything about it.	Ihe niile gbasara ya masịrị m.
Of course this is a bad idea.	N'ezie nke a bụ echiche ọjọọ.

I like them, though.	Enwere m mmasị na ha, n'agbanyeghị.
No one asked why.	Ọ dịghị onye jụrụ ihe kpatara ya.
That is why it is so important to do it well.	Ọ bụ ya mere o ji dị mkpa ka anyị mee ya nke ọma.
He knows her better than anyone else.	Ọ maara ya karịa onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
It's very simple.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe.

I did not think of it again until recently.	Echeghị m ya ọzọ ruo na nso nso a.
This is a busy time for me.	Nke a bụ oge ọrụ n'aka karịa m.
So, hurry up!	Ya mere, mee ọsọ ọsọ ọsọ ọsọ!
Take your time.	Were oge ya.
And it did for a while.	O wee mee nwa oge.
But you may not be there for a few years.	Ma ị nwere ike ị gaghị anọ ya n'ime afọ ole na ole.
I am not on the page.	Anọghị m na ibe.
Everyone thinks they know me.	Onye ọ bụla na-eche na ha maara m.
They never told us so.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha gwara anyị otú ahụ.
He made a lot of great plays in all these games.	O mere ọtụtụ nnukwu egwuregwu n'ime egwuregwu a niile.
I tried to be a good husband and father.	M gbalịrị ịbụ ezigbo di na nna.
He wants those things.	Ọ chọrọ ihe ndị ahụ.
The case is.	Ikpe ahụ bụ.
There may be more.	Enwere ike karịa.
Which place is not far.	Kedu ebe adịghị anya.
They are foreigners.	Ha bụ ndị mba ọzọ.
The man and woman were interviewed separately.	A gbara nwoke na nwanyị ahụ ajụjụ ọnụ iche iche.
She was never afraid to speak her mind.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ tụrụ egwu ikwu uche ya.
Let's do this.	Ka anyị mee nke a.
As you do about it.	Dị ka ị na-eme ihe gbasara ya.
None of his wives ran.	Ọ dịghị onye ọ bụla n'ime ụmụ nwanyị ya na-agba ọsọ.
However, it is difficult to say for sure.	Otú ọ dị, o siri ike ikwu n'ezie.
I think this is good.	Echere m na nke a dị mma.
That will not be easy.	Nke ahụ agaghị adị mfe ime.
The three most important.	Atọ kacha mkpa.
You must do this one by one.	Ị ga-eme nke a otu otu.
We are all in a tight budget.	Anyị anọ na ego siri ike.
He is well aware, in some ways.	Ọ maara nke ọma, n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
What is the reason?	Kedu ihe kpatara ya.
I didn’t think anything about it and moved on.	Echeghị m ihe ọ bụla banyere ya wee gaa n'ihu.
He is not strong, but he is alive.	Ọ dịghị ike, ma ọ dị ndụ.
Some days it takes longer than others.	Ụbọchị ụfọdụ ọ were ogologo oge karịa ndị ọzọ.
Someone loves a cold.	Mmadụ hụrụ oyi.
I can see where this is going.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ebe ihe a na-aga.
That kind of thinking.	Ụdị echiche ahụ.
Most women are looking for men.	Ọtụtụ ụmụ nwanyị na-achọ ụmụ nwoke.
He was clear about everything.	O doro ya anya ihe niile.
Make yourself great.	Mee onwe gị nnukwu.
It should not happen.	O kwesịghị ime.
As a result, there will be no photos.	N'ihi ya, a gaghị enwe foto.
It's a little sweet.	Ọ dị ntakịrị ụtọ.
I can't say I understood it myself.	Apụghị m ikwu na m ghọtara ya n'onwe m.
It seems to be my daily routine.	O yiri ka ọ bụ ọrụ ndụ m kwa ụbọchị.
He could not do it.	Ọ nweghị ike ime ya.
I don't think it will be successful.	Echeghị m na ọ ga-abụ ihe na-aga nke ọma.
He was obviously there, waiting for me.	O doro anya na ọ nọ ebe ahụ, na-eche m.
Every moment a little bit.	Oge ọ bụla obere ntakịrị.
It's really a photo.	Ọ bụ n'ezie foto.
He was obviously on the side of the police.	O doro anya na ọ nọ n'akụkụ ndị uwe ojii.
He looked at me immediately.	O lere m anya ozugbo.
He was easily offended.	Ọ dị ya mfe iwe iwe.
If you want to, of course.	Ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ, n'ezie.
Beautiful light.	Ọkụ mara mma.
He thought he was drinking.	O chere na ọ na-aṅụ mmanya.
The fact is that there is no one way.	Nke bụ eziokwu bụ na ọ dịghị otu ụzọ.
You have to do things yourself.	Ị ga-eme ihe n'onwe gị.
Of course, thank you.	N'ezie, daalụ.
They should get his house.	Ha kwesịrị ị nweta ụlọ ya.
He has no phone.	O nweghị ekwentị.
Otherwise, you will not be able to see it.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ị gaghị enwe ike ịhụ ya.
I think that’s his name.	Echere m na nke ahụ bụ aha ya.
I am not morning, but it is my favorite time of the day.	Abụghị m onye ụtụtụ, mana ọ bụ oge kacha amasị m n'ehihie.
They rushed him.	Ha gbara ya ọsọ ọsọ.
Just bad.	Naanị ihe ọjọọ.
Until then.	Ruo ya.
No, not close, not close, not close.	Mba, ọ bụghị nso, ọ bụghị nso, ọ bụghị nso.
My wife said it would be time to go home.	Nwunye m kwuru na ọ ga-abụ oge ịla n'ụlọ.
We know the place every day at any time.	Anyị maara ebe ụbọchị ọ bụla n'oge ọ bụla.
This is almost a daily occurrence.	Nke a fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ihe na-eme kwa ụbọchị.
All he had to do was go home and wait.	Naanị ihe ọ ga-eme bụ ịla n’ụlọ chere okwu ahụ.
He said he was doing it.	O kwuru na ya na-eme ya.
The first impression is important.	Mmetụta mbụ dị mkpa.
Hurry up, otherwise we will be sitting for school!	Mee ngwa ngwa, ma ọ bụghị anyị ga-anọ ọdụ maka ụlọ akwụkwọ!
There is nothing special here.	Ọ nweghị ihe pụrụ iche ebe a.
Sometimes it looks like two people.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ dị ka ọ bụ mmadụ abụọ.
In fact, there is no doubt about it.	Nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na obi abụọ adịghị ya.
I do not do it.	Anaghị m eme ya.
These are just two of the many success stories.	Ndị a bụ naanị abụọ n'ime ọtụtụ akụkọ ịga nke ọma.
They see nothing.	Ha ahụghị ihe ọ bụla.
He could hardly speak, when he fell.	O siri ike ikwu okwu, mgbe ọ dara.
It is good now.	Ọ dị mma ugbu a.
Get to know him well.	Mara ya nke ọma.
At first we thought.	Na mbụ anyị na-eche.
It is impossible to take pictures of the mind.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume ịkpọ foto nke uche.
For them, things are going well.	Maka ha, ihe na-aga nke ọma.
The city is famous for its old buildings.	Obodo a ma ama maka ụlọ ochie ya.
I don't see anyone performing such music here.	Ahụghị m onye na-eme egwu dị otú ahụ ebe a.
They are one.	Ha bụ otu.
He works late into the night.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ n'ime abalị kwa abalị.
Nothing stopped him.	Ọ dịghị ihe kwụsịrị ya.
And he vanished.	O wee pụọ n'anya.
Apartments have different applications.	Ụlọ nwere ngwa dị iche iche.
The fact is that it may not be.	Nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na o nwere ike ọ gaghị adị.
I need information!	Achọrọ m ozi!
There is little or no feeling.	Enwere ntakịrị ma ọ bụ enweghị mmetụta.
It's really good.	Ọ dị mma n'ezie.
Of course.	N'ezie.
One of the two will be used.	A ga-eji otu n'ime ha abụọ mee ihe.
It is not an opportunity of its own.	Ọ bụghị ohere nke ya.
Thank you so much for your help.	Daalụ nke ukwuu maka enyemaka gị.
They can do whatever they want.	Ha nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla masịrị ha.
He hated his work.	Ọ kpọrọ ọrụ ya asị.
How can we stop this from happening again?	Olee otú anyị ga-esi kwụsị nke a ime ọzọ?
Any music is good.	Egwu ọ bụla dị mma.
Local sources said a girl lived nearby.	Akụkọ gbasara obodo kwuru na otu nwa agbọghọ bi nso.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.
Impossible is authority.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume bụ ikike.
If you do not know.	Ọ bụrụ na ị maghị.
Your parents will not know.	Ndị mụrụ gị agaghị ama.
It is good that he did not.	Ọ dị mma na o nweghị.
The more power, the better.	Ka ike ka ukwuu, ka mma.
The children began to run.	Ụmụaka malitere ịgba ọsọ.
Some say too much speed.	Ụfọdụ na-ekwu na oke ọsọ dị oke oke.
It seems so.	Ọ dị ka ọ kwesịrị.
This is a small metal ball with water inside.	Nke a bụ obere bọọlụ igwe nwere mmiri n'ime.
This is difficult.	Ihe a siri ike.
Whatever we want.	Ihe ọ bụla anyị chọrọ.
I will continue this work in a few days.	Aga m aga n'ihu n'ọrụ a n'ime ụbọchị ole na ole.
The widow was alone.	Nwanyị ahụ di ya nwụrụ bụ naanị ya.
But it was a terrible time.	Mana ọ bụ oge dị egwu.
Have the best food of my life there.	Nwere nri kacha mma ná ndụ m ebe ahụ.
His plans were rejected at the meeting.	A jụrụ atụmatụ ya na nzukọ ahụ.
You think a lot about your life while traveling.	Ị na-eche ọtụtụ ihe banyere ndụ gị mgbe ị na-eme njem.
The interest is strong.	Mmasị ahụ siri ike.
It can be fun.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
He eventually stopped.	O mechara kwụsị.
You have no reason.	Ị nweghị ihe kpatara ya.
Drink plenty of water.	Na-aṅụ ọtụtụ mmiri.
At one point there, he would really like the boss.	N'otu oge n'ebe ahụ, ọ ga-amasị onye isi n'ezie.
You can't do that now.	Ị nweghị ike ime nke ahụ ugbu a.
They argue all the time.	Ha na-arụ ụka mgbe niile.
You cannot have many friends.	Ị nweghị ike inwe ọtụtụ ndị enyi.
Not a question.	Ọ bụghị ajụjụ.
They have one son.	Ha nwere otu nwa nwoke.
A year earlier, he had quit his job.	Otu afọ tupu mgbe ahụ, ọ kwụsịrị ọrụ ya.
Simple as that.	Dị mfe dị ka nke ahụ.
You should see my house.	I kwesịrị ịhụ ụlọ m.
People do not die.	Ndị mmadụ anaghị anwụ anwụ.
Let me tell you, you do.	Ka m gwa gị, ị na-eme ya.
Then, as fast as he came, the smile stopped.	Mgbe ahụ, ngwa ngwa dị ka ọ bịara, ọnụ ọchị ahụ kwụsịrị.
The problem is money.	Nsogbu bụ ego.
New rules went into effect last week.	Iwu ọhụrụ malitere n'izu gara aga.
This will not be like any other time.	Nke a agaghị adị ka oge ọ bụla ọzọ.
He thought he didn't care.	O chere na ọ chọghị ịma.
No money stopped this project.	Enweghị ego kwụsịrị ọrụ a.
The situation is very bad.	Ọnọdụ ahụ dị nnọọ njọ.
It is more than that.	Ọ karịrị nke ahụ.
We almost.	Anyị fọrọ nke nta ka .
But that does not always happen.	Ma nke ahụ apụghị ime ọtụtụ mgbe.
No one wants that kind of power.	Ọ dịghị onye chọrọ ike dị otú ahụ.
I tell you it is here.	Ana m agwa gị ka ọ dị ebe a.
Great quality.	Nnukwu mma.
He refused to call his family.	Ọ jụrụ ịkpọ ezinụlọ ya.
I will not be alone here.	Agaghị m anọ naanị m ebe a.
That is what he will do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ ga-eme.
The game was a huge success.	Egwuregwu ahụ bụ nnukwu ihe ịga nke ọma.
I looked at him through the door and he was still scared.	M lere ya anya site n'ọnụ ụzọ ma ọ ka na-atụ egwu.
Because you are strong.	N'ihi na i siri ike.
This may well be.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ nke ọma.
We will be there soon.	Anyị ga-anọ ebe ahụ n'oge adịghị anya.
He will not hear this.	Ọ gaghị anụ ihe a.
The accident happened so quickly.	Ihe mberede a mere ngwa ngwa.
Of course you do.	N'ezie ị na-eme ya.
We will do what we can to help you.	Anyị ga-eme ihe anyị nwere ike ime iji nyere gị aka.
But of course, these problems are everywhere.	Ma n'ezie, nsogbu ndị a dị n'ebe niile.
At home and at work all morning.	N'ụlọ na ụlọ ọrụ ụtụtụ niile.
He looked at his watch crying.	O lere elekere anya ya akwa.
In our patient, however, this is not the case.	N'ime onye ọrịa anyị, Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị ikpe.
He lives there with his wife and two children.	Ya na nwunye ya na ụmụ ya abụọ bi ebe ahụ.
I work.	M na-arụ ọrụ.
Water, as we all know, is important.	Mmiri, dị ka anyị niile maara, dị mkpa.
I like what they did here.	Ihe ha mere ebe a na-amasị m.
We left the trees when our son died.	Anyị hapụrụ osisi ndị ahụ mgbe nwa anyị nwụrụ.
What's that? 	Kedu ihe bụ nke ahụ?
he asked.	ọ jụrụ.
We know each other very well.	Anyị maara ibe anyị nke ọma.
Would you like to continue?	Ọ ga-amasị mmadụ ịga n'ihu?
The problem is.	Nsogbu bụ.
His face was burning.	Ihu ya gbara ọkụ.
It's beautiful, very beautiful.	Ọ mara mma, mara mma nke ukwuu.
My eyes met his.	Anya m zutere ya.
They are all important.	Ha niile dị mkpa.
It's a busy life, but it's good.	Ọ bụ ndụ ọrụ n'aka, ma ọ dị mma.
But it does happen sometimes.	Ma o mere, mgbe ụfọdụ.
Let's get out tonight.	Ka anyị pụọ n'abalị a.
Otherwise, it is not.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ bụghị.
Once they have it, not too long ago.	Ozugbo ha nwere, ọ bụghị ogologo oge gara aga.
But there is a chance.	Ma enwere ohere.
Take mine.	Were nke m.
That will do well.	Nke ahụ ga-eme nke ọma.
It was a beautiful time.	Ọ bụ oge mara mma.
It's coming well.	Ọ na-abịa nke ọma.
They live by the river.	Ha bi n'akụkụ osimiri.
The perfect way.	Ụzọ zuru oke.
Or is it.	Ma ọ bụ ya.
These are awesome times.	Ndị a bụ oge dị egwu.
These are things that really happen to people.	Ihe ndị a bụ ihe omume n'ezie na-eme ndị mmadụ n'ezie.
Why are so many people coming here?	Gịnị mere ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ji na-abịa ebe a?
I need rest.	Achọrọ m izu ike.
I miss you so much my brother.	A na m atụ uche gị nke ukwuu nwanne m nwoke.
Summer is a busy time.	Oge okpomọkụ bụ oge ọrụ n'aka.
They know it.	Ha maara ya.
Only now, not immediately.	Naanị ugbu a, ọ bụghị ozugbo.
my party is small.	oriri m dị obere.
Maybe a little bit.	Ma eleghị anya, ntakịrị ntakịrị.
Some companies do not want to do anything.	Ụfọdụ ụlọ ọrụ anaghị achọ ime ihe.
He liked the idea.	Echiche nke ahụ masịrị ya.
News happens in an hour.	Akụkọ na-eme n'otu awa.
The reason is simple.	Ihe mere o ji bụrụ eziokwu bụ ihe ọzọ.
This is an old book.	Nke a bụ akwụkwọ ochie.
It's fresh here.	Ọ dị ọhụrụ ebe a.
The room was full of energy.	Ike juru ọnụ ụlọ ahụ.
It is very difficult to say whether it was successful or not.	O siri ezigbo ike ikwu ma ọ gara nke ọma ma ọ bụ na o nweghị.
And why, you might say.	Na ihe kpatara ya, ị nwere ike ikwu.
Thanks for any comments.	Daalụ maka okwu ọ bụla.
Opportunities abound.	Ohere dị ọtụtụ.
I need a crowd.	Achọrọ m igwe mmadụ.
It would make such a beautiful photo.	Ọ ga-eme ka foto mara mma dị otú ahụ.
Driving only.	Ịnya ụgbọ ala naanị.
Now, you can't tell anyone anything.	Ugbu a, ị gaghị agwa onye ọ bụla ihe ọ bụla.
This time, however, he was right.	Otú ọ dị, na nke ugbu a, o kwuru eziokwu.
Which is better?	Kedu nke ka mma?
But it will not be easy.	Ma ọ gaghị adị mfe.
A beautiful face.	Ihu mara mma mara mma.
I wish they had a little more power.	Ọ dị m ka ya bụrụ na ha nwere ntakịrị ike.
That is my life.	Nke ahụ bụ ndụ m.
He needed help quickly and easily.	Enyemaka dị ya mkpa na ngwa ngwa.
So it is not different for them.	Ya mere, ọ bụghị dị iche iche maka ha.
But I see what you are saying.	Mana ahụrụ m ihe ị na-ekwu.
In our family.	Na ezinụlọ anyị.
This is a man, not a monster.	Nke a bụ nwoke, ọ bụghị nnukwu anụ.
This is going to be a big deal, man.	Nke a ga-abụ nnukwu ihe, nwoke.
I don't know why, but it's true.	Amaghị m ihe kpatara ya, mana ọ bụ eziokwu.
The thought seemed silly.	Echiche ahụ yiri ihe nzuzu.
I know who he is.	Ama m onye ọ bụ.
This is not the place.	Nke a abụghị ebe ahụ.
The group tried to buy two cars.	Ndị otu ahụ gbalịrị izu ụgbọ ala abụọ.
On the other hand, he was impressed.	N'aka nke ọzọ ọ masịrị ya.
No one should see it here.	Ọ dịghị onye kwesịrị ịhụ ya ebe a.
I did nothing.	Emeghị m ihe ọ bụla.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
He was given every opportunity.	E nyere ya ohere ọ bụla.
They are two ways, both.	Ha bụ ụzọ abụọ, ha abụọ.
So, the first job can be said, can be bought.	Ya mere, enwere ike ikwu ọrụ mbụ, nwere ike zụta ya.
He wondered why it was so important.	Ọ nọ na-eche ihe mere o ji dị ezigbo mkpa.
It is just what happens.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ihe na-eme.
We never did.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị mere.
The staff was beautiful.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ mara mma.
He is happy that he succeeded.	Obi dị ya ụtọ na ọ gara nke ọma.
They took months.	Ha were ọnwa.
I have a back.	Azụ ya dị m.
There he had a friend who owned a store.	N'ebe ahụ, o nwere otu enyi ya nwere ụlọ ahịa.
It's a shame to leave.	Ọ bụ ihe nwute ịpụ n'isi.
I need big coffee to stay awake!	Achọrọ m nnukwu kọfị ka m mụrụ anya!
He is said to be superior to anyone else.	A na-ekwu na ọ ka onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
I want to be your friend.	Achọrọ m ịbụ enyi gị.
It is not true that we need this man.	Ọ bụghị eziokwu na anyị chọrọ nwoke a.
Perfect for now.	Zuru oke maka ugbu a.
However.	Otú ọ dị.
Most families said no.	Ọtụtụ ezinụlọ kwuru mba.
How to work.	Otu esi arụ ọrụ.
It had a profound effect.	O nwere mmetụta dị ukwuu.
The food at the restaurant is fantastic.	Nri dị na ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ dị egwu.
Fun.	Ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
They said we can get them tomorrow.	Ha kwuru na anyị nwere ike nweta ha echi.
Is this.	Nke a bụ.
You have your money.	Ị nwere ego gị.
Not so much with my hard work.	Ọ bụghị nke ukwuu na ọrụ m siri ike.
Where did everyone go?	Ebee ka onye ọ bụla gara?
Not your debt, but customers.	Ọ bụghị ụgwọ gị, mana ndị ahịa.
He can give it to you right away.	O nwere ike inye gị ozugbo.
We can't go fast.	Anyị enweghị ike ịga ngwa ngwa.
But she did not know what to do next.	Ma ọ maghị ihe ọzọ ọ ga-eme.
The building is a landmark.	Ụlọ ahụ bụ ihe ama ama.
Only three of them.	Naanị atọ si na ya.
Which is in my head.	Nke dị n'isi m.
I really like it, of course.	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu, n'ezie.
The event was awesome!	Ihe omume ahụ dị egwu!
The room was full of food.	Isi nke nri juru n'ime ụlọ ahụ.
We do not want to see that happen.	Anyị achọghị ịhụ ka nke ahụ mee.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
We did the best we could.	Anyị mere naanị ihe anyị nwere ike ime.
It will only be married.	Ọ ga-enwe naanị di na nwunye.
She wondered what she should do.	Ọ nọ na-eche ihe ọ tụrụ anya ime.
He did not know the location.	Ọ maghị ebe ahụ.
I think of many things.	M na-eche maka ọtụtụ ihe.
At best, bad things happen.	Nke kacha mma, ihe ọjọọ dị mkpa.
None of that matters.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla dị mkpa.
I have been looking for this information for a long time.	Anọ m na-achọ ozi a nke ọma ogologo oge.
Not the hard type.	Ọ bụghị ụdị siri ike.
It's better to play a little music, but better.	Ọ ka mma igwu obere egwu, mana ka mma.
There are houses everywhere.	Enwere ụlọ ebe niile.
You are stronger than most other students here.	Ị dị ike karịa ọtụtụ ụmụ akwụkwọ ndị ọzọ ebe a.
But it is not my job.	Mana ọ bụghị ọrụ m.
Much worse than the real thing.	Dị nnọọ njọ karịa ihe n'ezie.
That is not true.	Nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
Both are good.	Ha abụọ dị mma.
The truth of the matter is true.	Eziokwu nke okwu ahụ bụ eziokwu.
There is something wrong.	Ọ nwere ihe adịghị mma.
I didn’t think much of it.	Echeghị m banyere ya nke ukwuu.
It seems.	O yiri ka.
They like it a little bit.	Ha na-enwe mmasị na ya ntakịrị.
The temperature is perfect.	Ọnọdụ okpomọkụ zuru oke.
He was sure that he had never seen her.	O doro ya anya na ọ dịghị mgbe ọ hụrụ ya.
Reports say we arrived early this morning.	Akụkọ kwuru na anyị rutere n'isi ụtụtụ a.
He did not know what to expect.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ tụrụ anya ya.
You are my.	Ị bụ.
I think he is trying to help me in an awesome way.	Echere m na ọ na-agbalị inyere m aka n'ụzọ dị egwu ya.
Many tourists come here every year.	Ọtụtụ ndị njem na-abịa ebe a kwa afọ.
It is, again, not a group meeting.	Ọ bụ, ọzọ, ọ bụghị nzukọ otu.
It's a really good feeling.	Ọ bụ mmetụta dị mma n'ezie.
In the position of the car.	Na ọnọdụ nke ụgbọ ala.
She is a woman who eats breakfast.	Ọ bụ nwanyị na-eri nri ụtụtụ.
Now he is telling the truth.	Ugbu a ọ na-ekwu eziokwu.
We wait a little longer.	Anyị na-eche obere ya.
We both read it, many people read it.	Anyị abụọ na-agụ ya, ọtụtụ mmadụ na-agụ ya.
They can not be or do anything else.	Ha enweghị ike ịbụ ma ọ bụ mee ihe ọzọ.
He gave them wine.	O nyere ha mmanya.
But he is not alone.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị ya.
At this time, however, nobody was going anywhere.	Otú ọ dị, n'oge a, ọ dịghị onye na-aga ebe ọ bụla.
But these are not the kinds of people he knows.	Ma ndị a abụghị ụdị ndị ọ maara.
Probably more expensive.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị ọnụ karịa.
I have boys.	Enwere m ụmụ nwoke.
But that is not the case.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị ikpe ahụ.
Lots of problems.	Ọtụtụ nsogbu.
Not very known, but it works.	Ọ bụghị nke ukwuu mara, ma ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
It is nothing but perfect.	Ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla ma ọ bụghị zuru oke.
Not that we knew that at the time.	Ọ bụghị na anyị maara nke ahụ n'oge ahụ.
But at that time, their faces were not well known.	Ma n'oge ahụ, a maghị ihu ha nke ọma.
Let me tell you something else.	Ka m gwa gị ihe ọzọ.
But how we do it is important.	Ma otú anyị si eme ya dị mkpa.
I want to do the same, too.	Achọrọ m ime otu, kwa.
I wonder what will happen now.	M na-eche ihe ga-eme ugbu a.
Perfect music's home last night.	Ihe egwu egwu egwu n'ụlọ zuru oke n'abalị ụnyaahụ.
Difficult for some.	Ihe siri ike maka ụfọdụ.
It should be mine.	O kwesịrị ịbụ nke m.
It is near here.	Ọ nọ nso ebe a.
Or make a lot of my customers.	Ma ọ bụ na-eme ka ọtụtụ ndị ahịa m.
Now he is here.	Ugbu a ọ nọ ebe a.
I tell you this.	Ana m agwa gị ihe a.
Then they are unemployed.	Mgbe ahụ ha na-enweghị ọrụ.
It goes a long way.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu ogologo oge.
I feel good about myself.	Adị m mma n'onwe m.
Believe that everything he said was true.	Kwere na ihe ọ bụla o kwuru bụ eziokwu.
He did just that.	O mere nke ahụ.
It was bad that her daughter was there.	Ọ dị njọ na nwa ya nwanyị nọ ebe ahụ.
But the fear is there.	Mana egwu dị ebe ahụ.
That is not the situation we have before us in this.	Nke ahụ abụghị ọnọdụ anyị nwere n'ihu anyị na nke a.
If you are not happy, we are not happy.	Ọ bụrụ na ị naghị enwe obi ụtọ, anyị anaghị enwe obi ụtọ.

Suddenly, they were overjoyed.	Na mberede, obi dị ha ụtọ.

Maybe they did something wrong.	Ma eleghị anya, ha mere ihe na-adịghị mma.
Laughter in the ears.	Ọchị ntị na ntị.

My friend told me that everything would be fine.	Enyi m gwara m na ihe niile ga-adị mma.

Apparently, he thought.	O doro anya, o chere.
This is true, not true.	Nke a bụ n'ezie, ọ bụghị eziokwu.

But they feel satisfied.	Ma ọ dị ha ka afọ juru ha.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
One reason is money.	Otu ihe kpatara ya bụ ego.
He took the medicine as prescribed.	O were ọgwụ ahụ nke ọma dị ka a gwara ya.
It does not have to take long.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ka ọ were ogologo oge.

Great job at a reasonable price.	Nnukwu ọrụ dị mma na ọnụ ahịa ezi uche dị na ya.
He was never our friend.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ bụ enyi anyị.

This can be a problem.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ nsogbu.
We do not need help.	Anyị achọghị enyemaka.
It belongs to my grandmother.	Ọ bụ nke nne nne m.
Or maybe they just want to feel strong.	Ma ọ bụ ma eleghị anya, ha chọrọ nnọọ inwe mmetụta dị ike.
It's too scary.	Ọ dị oke egwu.
However, it is symbolic.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụ ihe atụ.
That is his strengths and weaknesses.	Nke ahụ bụ ike ya na adịghị ike ya.
He really knows all about these things.	Ọ maara ihe niile banyere ihe ndị a n'ezie.
But his life is different now.	Ma ndụ ya dị iche ugbu a.
Then people don’t want to play anymore.	Mgbe ahụ ndị mmadụ achọghị igwu egwu ọzọ.
But that is now, my day.	Ma nke ahụ dị ugbu a, ụbọchị m.
Someone wants me out of the way.	Onye chọrọ ka m pụọ n'ụzọ.

Then it is different.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ dị iche.
Tell us a happy story.	Gwa anyị akụkọ obi ụtọ.
I will not preach to anyone.	Agaghị m onye ọ bụla ozi ọma.
It was his father's watch.	Ọ bụ elekere nna ya.

This can be known as the "moral horror act."	Enwere ike mara nke a dị ka "egwu egwu omume."
Very well.	Ọ dị mma nke ukwuu.
Now we know they do.	Ugbu a, anyị maara na ha na-eme.
It could be about my son or my spouse.	O nwere ike ịbụ gbasara nwa m nwoke ma ọ bụ nwunye m.
Not that they will be able.	Ọ bụghị na ha ga-enwe ike.
They just gave me the phone.	Naanị ha nyere m ekwentị.
It’s just my opinion.	Ọ bụ naanị echiche nke m.
Let me be taken seriously.	Ka e were m kpọrọ ihe.
Such authority does not exist now.	Ikike dị otú ahụ adịghị ugbu a.
The city is on the verge.	Obodo dị n'ọnụ.
I need some.	Achọrọ m ụfọdụ.
Big and scary.	Nnukwu na egwu.
Obviously, this will not be the last time.	O doro anya na nke a agaghị abụ oge ikpeazụ.
There is only one bed per patient per week.	Enwere naanị otu akwa kwa onye ọrịa kwa izu.
The event was long.	Ihe omume ahụ dị ogologo.
He is my patient.	Ọ bụ onye ọrịa m.
Seeing his name scared me.	Ịhụ aha ya mere ka m nwee ụjọ.
I need both.	Achọrọ m ha abụọ.

The feeling is very strong.	Mmetụta ahụ siri ezigbo ike.
The machine is still running.	Igwe ahụ ka na-agba ọsọ.
So it is good to think they are happening at the same time.	Ya mere, ọ dị mma iche na ha na-eme n'otu oge.
I was amazed at how successful he was.	O juru m anya ka ọ na-aga nke ọma.
But he knows that he is not alone.	Ma ọ ma na ọ bụghị naanị ya kpatara ya.
There are several ways to do this.	Enwere ụzọ dị iche iche isi mee nke a.
I was sad then.	Ọ dị m njọ mgbe ahụ.

He knew he was coming.	Ọ maara na ọ na-abịa.
The 'us' are.	Ndị 'anyị' bụ.
Give me your thoughts on things.	Nye m echiche gị maka ihe.
That does me good.	Nke ahụ na-eme m nke ọma.
But there is more.	Mana enwere ihe ọzọ kwa.
The trip took two days.	Njem ahụ were ụbọchị abụọ.
It's not just weaknesses right now.	Ọ bụghị naanị adịghị ike ugbu a.
Emotional questions.	Ajụjụ mmetụta uche.

They are very friendly.	Ha nwere nnọọ enyi.

This is the first time.	Nke a bụ nke mbụ.

As it is, now.	Dị ka ọ dị, ugbu a.
The friends you have are still your friends.	Ndị enyi gị nwere ka bụ ndị enyi gị.
These trees are ancient and beautiful.	Osisi ndị a bụ oge ochie na ndị mara mma.
I think it makes us special.	Echere m na ọ na-eme ka anyị pụrụ iche.
That is why he is here.	Ọ bụ ya mere o ji nọrọ ebe a.
He has a beautiful face.	O nwere ihu mara mma.
This is a good thing.	Nke a bụ ihe ọma.
The other two, that’s a different story.	Abụọ nke ọzọ, nke ahụ bụ akụkọ dị iche.
I want to be away.	Achọrọ m ịnọ ebe dị anya.
Using that kind of life for storytelling.	Iji ụdị ndụ ahụ maka akụkọ akụkọ.
You will be a father to his children.	Ị ga-abụ nna ụmụ ya.
What is good and what is bad is bad.	Ihe dị mma na ọkụ adịghị mma.
Every minute now.	Nkeji ọ bụla ugbu a.
They were obviously angry and emotional.	O doro anya na iwe were ha na mmetụta uche.
It's a powerful thing.	Ọ bụ ihe dị ike.
But he got good things.	Ma o nwetara ezigbo ihe.
For a reason.	Maka ihe kpatara ya.
That can be an example of our own life.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ ihe atụ nke ndụ anyị.
They will all have the same behavior here.	Ha niile ga-enwe otu omume ebe a.
Again, simple.	Ọzọ, dị mfe.
Of course, it's funny.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ihe ọchị.
It is good to talk to your mother.	Ọ dị mma ịgwa nne gị okwu.
This is great for your car.	Nke a dị mma maka ụgbọ ala gị.
He needs your family.	Ọ chọrọ ezinụlọ gị.

It was a cold winter.	Ọ bụ oyi na-adịghị mma.
However, that is a thing.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ bụ ihe.
Man and woman are for the body, they told me.	Nwoke na nwanyị bụ maka ahụ, ha gwara m.

He failed his driving test.	Ọ dara ule ịnya ụgbọ ala ya.
Of course, this goes a long way toward all of his work.	N'ezie, nke a na-aga n'ihu nke ukwuu ọrụ ya niile.
Employees of the company work.	Ndị ọrụ ụlọ ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ.
At this point, it seems we don't have the man.	N'oge a, ọ dị ka anyị enweghị nwoke ahụ.

We are successful now.	Anyị gara nke ọma ugbu a.
I just thought it would be nice to see you.	Naanị m chere na ọ ga-adị mma ịhụ gị.
Everyone told him.	Onye ọ bụla gwara ya.
He hated that feeling.	Ọ kpọrọ mmetụta ahụ asị.
But they are not here.	Ma ha anọghị ebe a.
It's too bad.	Ọ dị oke njọ.
However, that is not the case.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
This book is expensive.	Akwụkwọ a dị oke ọnụ.
None of them.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha.
No probably about it.	Mba eleghị anya banyere ya.
Indeed, they feared him.	N'ezie, ha na-atụ ya egwu.
Some women can.	Ụfọdụ ụmụ nwanyị nwere ike.
It's a big house.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ụlọ.
I can live with that for a long, long time.	Enwere m ike ịdị ndụ na nke ahụ ogologo oge, ogologo oge.
She is pregnant with her child.	Ọ dị ime nwa ya.
For more money.	Maka ego ọzọ.

Some people do not like to eat fish.	Ụfọdụ ndị anaghị enwe mmasị iri azụ.

However, he did so at times.	Otú ọ dị, o mere ihe ndị ahụ mgbe ụfọdụ.
The night is still young.	Abalị ka bụ nwata.
Food is a fact of life.	Nri bụ eziokwu nke ndụ.
However, this is not true.	Otú ọ dị, nke a abụghị eziokwu.
This is happening now.	Nke a na-eme ugbu a.
We can't do it just in school.	Anyị enweghị ike ime ya naanị n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
It is a difficult question.	Ọ bụ ajụjụ siri ike.
But anyone who causes this may not know it.	Mana onye ọ bụla kpatara nke a nwere ike ọ gaghị ama nke ahụ.

Both children love this book.	Ụmụaka abụọ a hụrụ akwụkwọ a n'anya.

This is very good.	Nke a dị nnọọ mma.
He looked at his wallet.	O lere anya na obere akpa ya.
He did not know about the moment.	Ọ maghị maka oge ahụ.
I did not like what he and his mother thought of us.	Enweghị m mmasị n'ihe ya na nne ya chere banyere anyị.
This time the message was successful.	Oge a ozi ahụ gara nke ọma.
There is no such law.	Enweghị iwu dị otú ahụ.
I do not know how, but it went to money.	Amaghị m otú, ma ọ gara na ego.
Lots of character, lots of things happening.	Ọtụtụ agwa, ọtụtụ ihe na-eme.
Do you think it will work out well?	Ị chere na ọ ga-eme nke ọma?
Of course, you want them to not.	N'ezie, ị chọrọ ka ha ghara.

What’s more, it doesn’t taste good.	Kedu ihe ọzọ, ọ naghị atọ ụtọ.

The roof looks like new.	Elu ụlọ ahụ yiri nke ọhụrụ.
That said, the test will continue.	Na nke ahụ kwuru, ule ga-aga n'ihu.
In his heart he knew that he was a real person.	N'obi ya, ọ maara na ọ bụ onye dị adị.
But he can say a few words about it.	Ma o nwere ike ikwu ihe ole na ole banyere ya.
The work is very important.	Ọrụ ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa.

Suddenly, a car approached.	Na mberede, ụgbọ ala rutere nso.

But in the long run, it can really go away.	Ma n'ime ogologo oge, ọ nwere ike ịla n'ezie.
But it is easy to do.	Ma ọ dị mfe ime.
We need to do another test.	Anyị kwesịrị ime ule ọzọ.
He hates us.	Ọ kpọrọ anyị asị.
He continued.	Ọ gara n'ihu.
We are talking about it.	Anyị na-ekwu maka ya.
Not so much, he understood quickly.	Ọ bụghị nke ukwuu, ọ ghọtara ngwa ngwa.
Some argue that the plan is untrue.	Ụfọdụ na-arụ ụka na atụmatụ ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
That was the first.	Nke ahụ na mbụ.
You have the right to be happy.	Ị nwere ikike inwe obi ụtọ.
Before many people.	Tupu ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ.
It's too bad.	Ọ dị nnọọ njọ.
We have a lot of work.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ ọrụ.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	O nwere ike ịbụ ihe kpatara ya.
There is a limit to everything.	Enwere oke maka ihe niile.
Fun work, done every day.	Ọrụ na-atọ ụtọ, a na-eme kwa ụbọchị.
He does that sometimes.	Ọ na-eme nke ahụ mgbe ụfọdụ.

You left me nothing.	Ọ nweghị ihe ị hapụrụ m.
At any time before the trial.	N'oge ọ bụla tupu ikpe.
They did it together.	Ha mere ya ọnụ.
Everyone is hungry.	Agụụ dara onye ọ bụla ike.
He should not do this.	O kwesịghị ime nke a.
He never stayed that way for a long time though.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ nọrọ otú ahụ ogologo oge n'agbanyeghị.
It is still there.	Ọ ka dị n'ebe ahụ.
No one had done that to me in my previous life.	Ọ dịghị onye ọ bụla mere m otú ahụ ná ndụ m mbụ.

This is to give everyone a chance and opportunity.	Nke a bụ maka inye mmadụ niile ohere na ohere.
This is an important and costly task.	Nke a bụ ọrụ dị mkpa ma dị oke ọnụ.
It seems perfect.	Ọ dị ka ọ zuru oke.

Keep your body healthy.	Mee ka ahụ gị dị mma.

Now my wife began to cry.	Ugbu a nwunye m malitere ibe ákwá.
They are still working.	Ha ka na-arụ ọrụ.
But that is not the case.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị ikpe a.
I do not care.	Achọghị m ịma.
We really need to get face to face.	Anyị kwesịrị n'ezie iji nweta ihu n'otu.
His path is uncertain.	Ụzọ ya ejighị n'aka.
This point can be made in two ways.	Enwere ike ime isi ihe a n'ụzọ abụọ.
Not authority.	Ọ bụghị ikike.
Not huge or anything.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
It is not immediately clear how to play.	Ọ bụghị ozugbo doro anya ka esi egwu egwu.
This is what happens when you go to the hospital.	Nke a bụ ihe na-eme mgbe ịga ụlọ ọgwụ.
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to do what we enjoy.	Daalụ maka inye anyị ohere ime ihe na-atọ anyị ụtọ.
But he thinks it will be you.	Ma o chere na ọ ga-abụ gị.
This can't go anywhere.	Nke a enweghị ike ịga ebe ọ bụla.
Some of these are very important.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ya dị nnọọ mkpa.
It may be the first.	O nwere ike ịbụ nke mbụ.
It seems to be working well.	Ọ dị ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.

That is, we can end the problem.	Ya bụ, anyị nwere ike ime ka nsogbu ahụ kwụsị.
Of course not.	N'ezie o nweghị ike.
He does not seem to be weak.	O yighị ka onye na-adịghị ike.
You do not know anything about it.	Ị maghị ihe ọ bụla gbasara ya.
Everything is different now.	Ihe niile dị iche ugbu a.
These are really my two most important words.	Ndị a bụ n'ezie okwu abụọ m kacha.

They are the same thing.	Ha bụ otu ụdị ihe ahụ.
We’re in this together, so let’s get to it !.	Anyị nọ na nke a ọnụ, ya mere ka anyị nweta ya!.
We have other things to do.	Anyị nwere ihe ndị ọzọ anyị ga-eme.
However, using them is not as simple as it sounds.	Otú ọ dị, iji ha eme ihe adịghị mfe dị ka ọ dị.
I do not want a company.	Achọghị m ụlọ ọrụ.
And you do it, over and over again.	Na ị na-eme ya, ugboro ugboro na ugboro ugboro.
Or at least the readers are.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ndị na-agụ bụ.
So this is the thing.	Ya mere, nke a bụ ihe.

They will use their money wisely.	Ha ga-eji ego ha mara ihe n'ezie.
No job.	Enweghị ọrụ.
Every fool knows that.	Onye nzuzu ọ bụla maara nke ahụ.
For some applications, this is critical.	Maka ụfọdụ ngwa, nke a dị oke egwu.
I would like to think that did not really happen.	Ọ ga-amasị m iche na nke ahụ emeghị n'ezie.
It does not always work well.	Ọ bụghị mgbe niile ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
It was the dog that came to tell us.	Ọ bụ nkịta bịara gwa anyị.
Sometimes it was a woman, then the screams continued.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ bụ nwanyị, mgbe ahụ, mkpu na-aga n'ihu.
Do good to those who hate you.	Mere ndị kpọrọ gị asị ihe ọma.
The same is not true for every successful woman.	Otu ihe ahụ anaghị adị maka nwanyị ọ bụla na-eme nke ọma.
The head of the machine is awesome.	Isi nke igwe dị egwu.

He could not really do that.	O nweghị ike ime nke ahụ n'ezie.
Our store caught fire last night.	Ụlọ ahịa anyị gbara ọkụ n'abalị ụnyahụ.
I think this is true in a fun way.	Echere m na nke a bụ eziokwu n'ụzọ dị iche iche na-atọ ụtọ.
There are usually three or four hours of sleep.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụbọchị ụra awa atọ ma ọ bụ anọ.

He can’t see how anyone can get so good with that thing.	Ọ nweghị ike ịhụ ka onye ọ bụla ga-esi nweta ezigbo ihe na ihe ahụ.
She liked to talk to him, and the boy liked it.	Ọ na-amasị ya ịgwa ya okwu, masịrị nwa nwoke ahụ.
I can see why.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ihe kpatara ya.
Now he needs a new name.	Ugbu a ọ chọrọ aha ọhụrụ.
When the night is short, we like to go out.	Mgbe abalị dị obere, anyị na-enwe mmasị ịpụ.
I won't go down there too much.	Agaghị m ala ebe ahụ nke ukwuu.

Great promise.	Akwa nkwa.
Your body is your body.	Ahụ gị bụ ahụ gị.

He was surprised it was easy.	O juru ya anya na ọ dị mfe.

They are still a family.	Ha ka bụ ezinụlọ.

The interview ended.	Ajụjụ ọnụ ahụ kwụsịrị.

He took coffee with his breakfast.	O were kọfị na nri ụtụtụ ya.

Fast forward to this spring and they have some new ones.	Ngwa ngwa n'ihu na mmiri a ma ha nwere ụfọdụ ndị ọhụrụ.

There is a reason we are still here.	O nwere ihe mere anyị ka ji nọrọ ebe a.
Probably not so simple.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị otú ahụ dị mfe.
They want it.	Ha chọrọ ya.
Maybe we know someone.	Ma eleghị anya, anyị ji otu onye maara.
I don’t know why that was, but only.	Amaghị m ihe kpatara nke ahụ ji bụrụ, mana ọ bụ naanị.
Let it be near.	Ka ọ dị nso.

They rushed.	Ha gbara ọsọ ọsọ.
With the other team.	Ya na ndị otu nke ọzọ.
I looked around the house.	M lere anya gburugburu ụlọ ahụ.
His work was successful.	Ọrụ ya gara nke ọma.
I hope help will come.	Enwere m olileanya na enyemaka ga-abịa.
I have not.	Enweghị m.
He comes from a large family.	O si na nnukwu ezinụlọ.
They had two children.	Ha mụrụ ụmụ abụọ.
Other than the fun time it was great.	Ndị ọzọ karịa oge ọchị ahụ ọ dị oke mma.
I found it beautiful.	Ahụrụ m ya mara mma.
But it was ten years ago.	Ma ọ bụ afọ iri gara aga.
So we.	N'ihi ya, anyị .
Music video or film of extreme horror.	Ihe nkiri egwu ma ọ bụ ihe nkiri nke oke egwu.
They go from door to door.	Ha na-aga site n'ọnụ ụzọ ruo n'ọnụ ụzọ.
You can not stay in the case.	Ị nweghị ike ịnọ na ikpe ahụ.
We are a little hot.	Anyị dị ntakịrị ọkụ.
And how we miss each other.	Na otú anyị si atụ uche ibe anyị.
A new school was needed immediately.	A chọrọ ụlọ akwụkwọ ọhụrụ ozugbo.
This is not the point.	Nke a abụghị isi okwu a.
When he heard this, he started to cry.	Mgbe ọ nụrụ nke a, ọ malitere ibe ákwá.
As wives do if they are of his type.	Dị ka ndị nwunye na-eme ma ọ bụrụ na ha bụ ụdị ya.
If there is no one among you, they will not search for any of you.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ nweghị onye n'ime unu, ha agaghị achọ onye ọ bụla n'ime unu.
He is here all weekend.	Ọ nọ ebe a izu ụka niile.
This house is his right.	Ụlọ a bụ nke ya n'aka nri.
Second, the claims are not true.	Nke abụọ, ihe ndị a na-ekwu abụghị eziokwu.
We are doing its job.	Anyị na-arụ ọrụ ya.
Be real.	Bụrụ onye dị adị.
We do our best.	Anyị na-eme ike anyị niile.
Both cities have large foreign populations.	Obodo abụọ a nwere nnukwu ndị si mba ọzọ.
He continued to move forward.	Ọ gara n'ihu na-aga n'ihu.
Many for the better.	Ọtụtụ maka mma.
No one loves her.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya n'anya.
It will be a pleasure to see him again.	Obi ga-adị m ụtọ ịhụ ya ọzọ.
She seemed surprised.	Ọ dị ya ka o juru ya anya.
I did not find anything about them.	Ahụghị m ihe ọ bụla gbasara ha.
I need another chance.	Achọrọ m ohere ọzọ.
The reason is that some things may be better than others.	Ihe kpatara ya bụ na ụfọdụ ihe nwere ike ịdị mma karịa ndị ọzọ.
I did not know of their existence until last year.	Amaghị m ịdị adị ha ruo afọ gara aga.
No, that's fine.	Mba, ọ dị mma.
I do good to those who do good to me.	M na-eme ndị na-eme m ihe ọma.
I just want to be alone.	Naanị m chọrọ ịnọ naanị m.
What lights go into the room and when.	Kedu ọkụ na-aga n'ime ụlọ na mgbe.
I said it.	M kwuru ya.
He can't drive.	O nweghị ike ịnya ụgbọ ala.
Not for many years either.	Ọ bụghị ruo ọtụtụ afọ ma.
They are very important to me.	Ha dị m ezigbo mkpa.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ bụ otu ihe mere ha ji hụ ya n’anya nke ukwuu.
We refused to proceed.	Anyị jụrụ ịga n'ihu.
He could not see the way around.	Ọ nweghị ike ịhụ ụzọ gburugburu.
They are all free.	Ha niile nwere onwe ha.
But it is my favorite.	Mana ọ bụ ya kacha amasị m.
This is a beautiful old house.	Nke a bụ ụlọ ochie mara mma.
None of that.	Ọ dịghị nke.
And of course not a boyfriend.	Na n'ezie ọ bụghị enyi nwoke.
We point to other countries as examples.	Anyị na-atụ aka na mba ndị ọzọ dị ka ihe atụ.
Each of them is run for each type.	A na-agba ọsọ nke ọ bụla n'ime ha maka ụdị ọ bụla.
His house is on the way, sort of.	Ụlọ ya nọ n'ụzọ, ụdị.
That's not fair.	Nke ahụ adịghị mma.
Everyone does a lot of work.	Onye ọ bụla na-arụ ọtụtụ ọrụ.
Not how she feels.	Ọ bụghị otú obi dị ya.
But only to one point.	Mana naanị ruo otu isi.
It was bad for them anyway.	Ọ dị njọ maka ha n'agbanyeghị.
That will not happen.	Nke ahụ agaghị eme.
Some will be more.	Ụfọdụ ga-abụ karịa.
I'm very sorry	Ọ dị m nwute nke ukwuu
They have none.	Ha enweghị nke ọ bụla.
I would like him to be the one we know.	Ọ ga-amasị m ka ọ bụrụ onye anyị maara.
About ten years ago, life was very different here.	Ihe dị ka afọ iri gara aga, ndụ dị nnọọ iche n'ebe a.
There may be better ways to do this.	Enwere ike inwe ụzọ ka mma isi mee nke a.
He needs a good home.	Ọ chọrọ ezigbo ụlọ.
However, it is not.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị.
He continued.	Ọ gara n'ihu.
This couple is happy to see the pictures.	Di na nwunye a nwere obi ụtọ ịhụ foto.
That doesn't appeal.	Nke ahụ anaghị amasị ya.
Not immediately.	Ọ bụghị ozugbo.
I can't see you like this.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ gị otu a.
We are very healthy.	Ahụ́ na-ama anyị nke ukwuu.
Or better yet.	Ma ọ bụ ka mma.
They went to the hospital.	Ha gara ụlọ ọgwụ.
There is the issue again.	Enwere okwu ahụ ọzọ.
They are so beautiful.	Ha mara mma nke ukwuu.
The perpetrators were sentenced to three years in prison.	A mara ndị mere ihe ahụ ikpe ịga mkpọrọ afọ atọ.
They got it.	Ha nwetara ya.
It can be used as a weapon.	Enwere ike iji ya dị ka ngwa ọgụ.
No, it is not.	Mba, ọ bụghị.
I am confident in it.	Enwere m obi ike maka ya.
It will be something new if it exists.	Ọ ga-abụ ihe ọhụrụ ma ọ bụrụ na ọ dị.
This we can not do.	Nke a anyị enweghị ike ime.
The only man.	Nwoke naanị ya.
Or some stories.	Ma ọ bụ ụfọdụ akụkọ.
It's good.	Ọ dị mma.
We rushed to the hospital.	Anyị gbara ọsọ gaa ụlọ ọgwụ.
I'm glad you're around.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ị nọ gburugburu.
But my fight continues.	Ma ọgụ m na-aga n'ihu.
I should be.	m kwesịrị ịbụ.
So they said.	Ya mere, ha kwuru.
That is known.	Na a maara.
Other students seem to be nervous.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ndị ọzọ yiri ka ọ na-atụ ya ụjọ.
The house is nice.	Mma ụlọ dị mma.
He had no life of his own.	O nweghị ndụ nke ya.
Take your time but.	Were oge gị mana.
Now you are not.	Ugbu a ị bụghị.
They are beautiful	Ha mara mma
There are still many.	A ka nwere ọtụtụ.
After all, they are tough.	Mgbe ihe mechara, ha siri ike.
There is no way to help them.	O nweghị otú a ga-esi nyere ha aka.
It's just like anger.	Ọ dị nnọọ ka iwe.
What they do, what they plan.	Ihe ha na-eme, ihe ha na-eme atụmatụ.
It is not good.	Ọ dịghị mma.
First day, however.	Otú ọ dị, ụbọchị mbụ.
He hated what he heard.	Ihe ọ nụrụ were ya asị.
It is a beautiful small town.	Ọ bụ obere obodo mara mma.
Others are coming.	Ndị ọzọ na-abịa.
It's not really scary.	Ọ bụghị egwu n'ezie.
The house has several floors.	Ụlọ nwere ọtụtụ ala ụlọ.
That is not true.	Nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
I was behind him, almost behind him.	Anọ m n'azụ ya, ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ n'azụ ya.
This is good.	Nke a dị mma.
I took it by surprise.	M were ya na mberede.
He has something special about this.	O nwere ihe pụrụ iche banyere nke a.
That is a fact, and an important fact.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu, na eziokwu dị mkpa.
It's not very good.	Ọ dịghị mma nke ukwuu.
There are similar problems.	Nwere nsogbu ndị yiri ya.
Not enough money.	Enweghị ego zuru oke.
The only thing that surprised me was that.	Naanị ihe tụrụ m n'anya bụ nke ahụ.
Everyone is unique in his own way.	Onye ọ bụla pụrụ iche n'ụzọ nke ya.
Pretty one.	Onye mara mma.
The power to which no one else speaks.	Ikike nke ọ nweghị onye ọzọ na-ekwu okwu.
It can be anyone, from anywhere.	O nwere ike ịbụ onye ọ bụla, site n'ebe ọ bụla.
It is safe to use.	Ọ dị mma iji.
He was shocked.	O juru ya obi.
It was there that we last saw him.	Ọ bụ ebe ahụ ka anyị hụrụ ya ikpeazụ.
Not that he should.	Ọ bụghị na o kwesịrị ime.
He who loves his wife loves himself.	Onye hụrụ nwunye ya n’anya hụrụ onwe ya n’anya.
This game is very hot.	Egwuregwu a gbara ọkụ nke ukwuu.
Then he left.	Mgbe ahụ ọ hapụrụ.
He arrived home.	Ọ rutere n'ụlọ.
Probably a number of reasons.	Ma eleghị anya, e nwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
I can say what he thinks.	Enwere m ike ikwu ihe ọ na-eche.
The smile stopped.	Ọmụmụ ọnụ ọchị ahụ kwụsịrị.
They are awesome.	Ha bụ ihe dị egwu.
They are emotional.	Ha nwere mmetụta uche.
It's like us.	Ọ dị ka anyị.
Life is not a journey without clouds.	Ndụ abụghị njem na-enweghị igwe ojii.
Wait, that's a lie.	Chere, nke ahụ bụ ụgha.
He is the father of four children.	Ọ bụ nna ụmụ anọ.
He asked a question.	Ọ jụrụ ajụjụ.
It really helped us.	N'ezie nyere anyị aka.
Of course will do this again.	N'ezie ga-eme nke a ọzọ.
We plan to have a party with some of our friends.	Anyị na-eme atụmatụ iso ụfọdụ ndị enyi anyị nwee oriri.
This is not, of course, possible.	Nke a abụghị, n'ezie, enwere ike ime ya.
This is my last chance.	Nke a bụ ohere ikpeazụ m.
I'm with him now, he thought.	Anọ m ya ugbu a, o chere.
Some of them are more terrible than others.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ha dị egwu karịa ndị ọzọ.
He said the city needs good travel.	O kwuru na obodo a chọrọ njem nke ọma.
Time goes on.	Oge gara n'ihu.
It's hard to pretend I don't understand.	O siri ike ime ka ọ̀ aghọtaghị m.
Tell people what you did.	Gwa ndị mmadụ ihe ị mere.
Still, the fight continued.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọgụ ahụ gara n'ihu.
In this, therefore, they seem to think.	Na nke a, ya mere, ha yiri echiche.
He reads a little.	Ọ na-agụ obere ihe.
Obviously, people think it's a good idea.	N'ụzọ doro anya, ndị mmadụ na-eche na ọ bụ ezi echiche.
Now it's cold.	Ugbu a, oyi na-atụ.
They are close to each other.	Ha na ibe ha nso.
I saw what they did there.	Ahụrụ m ihe ha mere ebe ahụ.
It is better to leave here.	Ọ ka mma ka ị pụọ ebe a.
So pretty much.	Ya mere mara mma nke ukwuu.
I doubt that will be easy.	Enwere m obi abụọ na nke ahụ ga-adị mfe.
This is for me.	Nke a bụ maka m.
It was one of the best days of his life.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ụbọchị kacha mma ná ndụ ya.
Great teaching hospital.	Nnukwu ụlọ ọgwụ nkuzi.
It is very good to use.	Ọ dị mma nke ukwuu iji.
Few go to court.	Ole na ole na-aga ikpe.
I think it is you.	Echere m na ọ bụ gị.
That's nice to see.	Nke ahụ dị mma ịhụ.
He is very worried.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya nke ukwuu.
No brand has a head.	Ọ dịghị ụdị ọ bụla nwere isi.
Drink plenty of water.	Na-aṅụ ọtụtụ mmiri.
But he got that behind us.	Ma o nwetara nke ahụ n'azụ anyị.
Want to see how to do it ?.	Achọrọ ịhụ ka esi eme ya?.
Maybe the boys at my house did it the next night.	Ma eleghị anya, ụmụ nwoke n'ụlọ m mere n'abalị ọzọ.
Nothing more.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ.
You value that service.	Ị ji ọrụ ahụ kpọrọ ihe.

Let me tell you how I came to be.	Ka m gwa ya otú m si.
It is a good job.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ọrụ.
We will not stay long.	Anyị agaghị anọ ogologo ogologo oge.
Nothing serious.	Ọ dịghị mkpa.
I looked again.	M lere anya ọzọ.
But there is money.	Ma enwere ego.
Others may be on the way.	Ndị ọzọ nwere ike ịdị n'ụzọ.
The others stopped.	Ndị ọzọ kwụsịrị.
We can not go on like that.	Anyị enweghị ike ịga n'ihu otú ahụ.
The little boy was badly burned.	A gbara obere nwoke ahụ ọkụ nke ukwuu.
Stop the car.	Kwụsị ụgbọ ala.
Things that really matter.	Ihe ndị dị mkpa n'ezie.
Books are a little hard.	Akwụkwọ dị ntakịrị ike.
We thought it might in some way.	Anyị chere na ọ nwere ike n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
It is addictive.	Ọ na-eri ahụ.

Not its kind.	Ọ bụghị ya ụdị.
I can't run well.	Enweghị m ike ịgba ọsọ nke ọma.
That is a long story.	Nke ahụ bụ ogologo okwu.
It can be accessed using one.	Enwere ike iji otu nweta ya.
Nothing you said to me was too strict.	Ọ nweghị ihe ị gwara m nwere oke iwu.
They did, probably more often.	Ha mere, eleghị anya ọtụtụ mgbe.
Still alive with everything.	Ka dị ndụ na ihe niile.
The color of their skin is green.	Agba nke akpụkpọ ahụ ha nwere agba ndụ ndụ.
Probably the first president to go ahead.	Ma eleghị anya, onye isi ala mbụ na-aga n'ihu.
The situation is simple.	Ọnọdụ ahụ dị mfe.
Her parents are on vacation.	Nne na nna ya na-aga ezumike.
But he knew.	Ma ọ maara.
But they could not.	Ma ha enweghị ike.
I know this is awesome.	Ama m na nke a dị egwu.
This seems to be easier said than done.	Nke a yiri ka ọ dị mfe ikwu karịa ime.
Each of us.	Onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị.
They want beauty and function.	Ha na-achọ ịma mma na ọrụ.
I think more will come.	Echere m na ndị ọzọ ga-abịa.
I think new money.	Echere m ego ọhụrụ.
And you will be.	Na ị ga-abụ.
My work is going well.	Ọrụ m na-aga nke ọma.
I feel like I'm not there.	Ọ dị m ka anọghị m ebe ahụ.
But today is different.	Ma taa dị iche.
Even though we have a lot of life, we still need something.	N'agbanyeghị na ndụ anyị dị ukwuu, anyị ka nwere mkpa.
Prices fell sharply this year.	Ahịa dara nke ukwuu n'afọ a.
We are ready while you are there.	Anyị dị njikere mgbe ịnọ.
The land is fertile.	Ala a na-eme nri.
I don't want to do it.	Achọghị m ime ya.
Impossible for two.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume maka abụọ.
His mind is somewhere else.	Uche ya dị ebe ọzọ.
Now you know the difference.	Ugbu a, ị maara ihe dị iche.
Only two things make it unhealthy.	Naanị ihe abụọ na-eme ka ọ ghara ịdị mma.
That is unique.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe pụrụ iche.
It must have been my daughter and I.	Ọ ga-abụ mụ na nwa m nwanyị.
Few people met them.	Ọ bụ mmadụ ole na ole zutere ha.
They like someone who has more power.	Ha na-amasị onye nwere ike karịa.
That is my opinion.	Nke ahụ bụ echiche m.
You will not see immediately.	Ị gaghị ahụ ngwa ngwa.
You do not have to be angry.	I kwesịghị iwe iwe.
I think you will.	Echere m na ị ga-eme ya.
Otherwise, he may not do it until morning.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, o nwere ike ọ gaghị eme ya ruo ụtụtụ.
It runs very well.	Ọ na-agba ọsọ nke ọma.
It may be good to meditate on the truth.	Ọ pụrụ ịdị mma ka a na-eche eziokwu ahụ echiche.
Not the same thing.	Ọ bụghị otu ihe ahụ.
They will not, of course.	Ha agaghị, n'ezie.
He declined to comment on the situation.	Ọ jụrụ ikwu banyere ọnọdụ ahụ.
Are you at home.	Ị nọ n'ụlọ.
And dead trees.	Na osisi ndị nwụrụ anwụ.
He got into it.	Ọ banyere n'ime ya.
He allowed it.	O kwere ya.
I love his face so much.	Ahụrụ m ihu ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
I think this worked, a lot of people didn’t.	Echere m na nke a na-arụ ọrụ, ọtụtụ ndị emeghị.
They watched the event.	Ha lere ihe omume a na-eme.
First, it is very hot here.	Mbụ, ọ dị oke ọkụ ebe a.

But that is not the way it works.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka o si arụ ọrụ.
Let me know if they are fun.	Mee ka m mara ma ọ bụrụ na ha na-atọ ụtọ.
But in this case, not guilty.	Ma na nke a, ọ bụghị ikpe mara.
The same is true at school.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
Maybe she didn't want to be alone with him.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ chọghị ka ya na ya nọrọ naanị ya.
You are not what they are.	Ị bụghị ihe ha bụ.
It is the first.	Ọ bụ nke mbụ.
Now it is good.	Ugbu a dị mma.

He is a man of few words.	Ọ bụ nwoke na-ekwu okwu ole na ole.
You feel good and successful.	Ị na-enwe mmetụta nke ọma na ihe ịga nke ọma.
I love our color.	Ahụrụ m agba anyị n'anya.
A few bad months, a few good ones.	Ọnwa ole na ole ọjọọ, ole na ole dị mma.
It is a beautiful house.	Ọ bụ ụlọ mara mma.
Life, baby, live.	Ndụ, nwa, dị ndụ.
But we can move forward, maybe, if we can stay here longer.	Ma anyị nwere ike ịga n'ihu ma eleghị anya, ma ọ bụrụ na anyị nwere ike ịnọ ebe a ogologo oge.
This is your job.	Nke a bụ ọrụ gị.
No one suggested he was wanted.	Ọ dịghị onye tụrụ aro na achọrọ ya.
He wanted big money right away.	Ọ chọrọ nnukwu ego ozugbo.
And, journalists kind of laugh.	Na, ndị nta akụkọ ụdị ọchị.
I will do these nonsense.	Aga m eme ihe nzuzu ndị a.
Not there, but there it is.	Ọ bụghị ebe ahụ, mana ọ dị ebe ahụ.
These are stories that make you happy.	Ndị a bụ akụkọ na-eme gị obi ụtọ.
You have one year.	Ị nwere otu afọ.
You know you want to.	Ị maara na ị chọrọ.
That is their life.	Nke ahụ bụ ndụ ha.
It goes on and on.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu.
From here, the city is invisible.	Site ebe a, a naghị ahụ obodo ahụ anya.
Acting from anything.	Ime ihe site na ihe ọ bụla.
I'm glad you're with your cousin.	Obi dị m ụtọ na ị nọ na nwa nwanne nna gị.

Lots of great things.	Ọtụtụ ihe dị ukwuu.
If you do it.	Ọ bụrụ na ị na-eme ya.

This is the most important thing.	Nke a bụ ihe kacha mkpa.

We can go home.	Anyị nwere ike ịla n'ụlọ.
I'm not very sure.	Ejighị m n'aka nke ukwuu.
I knew this could happen.	Ama m na nke a nwere ike ime.
We are human.	Anyị bụ onye.
In dancing.	Na agba egwu.
But that’s me.	Ma nke ahụ bụ m.
We each have bodies.	Anyị onye ọ bụla nwere ahụ.
He liked the idea very much.	Echiche ahụ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
He is ready.	Ọ dị njikere.
We never had any.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị nwere nke ọ bụla.
And a lot of companies are working on that right now.	Na ọtụtụ ụlọ ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ na nke ahụ ugbu a.

And father.	Na nna.
Until you are ready to do something about it.	Ruo mgbe ị dị njikere ime ihe banyere ya.
I am a smart police officer.	Abụ m onye uwe ojii nwere isi nwere isi.
They talk about if everything makes sense.	Ha na-ekwu maka ma ọ bụrụ na ihe niile nwere ezi uche.
I found the book funny.	Ahụrụ m akwụkwọ ọchị.
The crew is not employed.	A naghị arụ ọrụ ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri.
The room is simple.	Ime ụlọ ahụ dị mfe.
It is very different.	Ọ dị nnọọ iche.
It will make it better.	Ọ ga-eme ka ọ dị mma.
But he could not do it.	Ma o nweghị ike ime ya.
The work took several hours.	Ọrụ ahụ were ọtụtụ awa.
We do the work right away.	Anyị na-arụ ọrụ ahụ ozugbo.
However, it is not difficult to do it yourself.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị ihe siri ike ime onwe gị.
But there are skeptics.	Ma e nwere ndị nwere obi abụọ.
Suddenly, he was right in front of me.	Na mberede, ọ nọ n'ihu m.
None of them have leaders.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ha nwere ndị isi.
Let me be a kid with you.	Ka m bụrụ nwata na gị.
This is useful.	Nke a bara uru.
I know it did.	Ama m na o mere.
But he went to the party.	Ma ọ gara oriri na ọṅụṅụ ahụ.
So make it impossible.	N'ihi ya, na-eme ka ọ ghara ịdị.
Maybe it's the wine.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ mmanya ahụ.
They do it because they can get out of it.	Ha na-eme ya n'ihi na ha nwere ike ịpụ na ya.
Dinner will then be ready.	Nri abalị ga-adị njikere mgbe ahụ.
She's beautiful, this girl, but not much of a joke.	Ọ mara mma, nwa agbọghọ a, mana ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ihe ọchị.
If you find it, let me know.	Ọ bụrụ na ịchọta ya, mee ka m mara.
We never eat it again.	Anyị anaghị eri ya ọzọ.
It was impossible for me to continue.	Ọ gaghị ekwe m omume ịga n'ihu.
It was a successful career.	Ọ bụ ọrụ na-aga nke ọma.
It's so beautiful.	Ọ mara mma nke ukwuu.
Couldn’t have the slightest interest.	Enweghị ike inwe mmasị dị ntakịrị.

Of course he did not know.	N'ezie ọ maghị.
Along with hypocrisy.	Tinyere ihu abụọ.
He is the brother of a close friend of mine.	Ọ bụ nwanne otu ezigbo enyi m.
He was working on it.	Ọ nọ na-arụ ọrụ na ya.
I see that here.	Ahụrụ m nke ahụ n'ebe a ebe.
There are trees.	E nwere osisi.
But then he got scared.	Ma ọzọ, ọ tụrụ ya ụjọ.
I do not have them.	Adịghị m ha.
This event was seen.	Ahụrụ ihe omume a.
I hope you are good at that.	Enwere m olileanya na ị dị mma na nke ahụ.
But the eye is not his father's.	Ma anya abụghị nke nna ya.
A large house surrounded him.	Nnukwu ụlọ gbara ya gburugburu.
These are really important things.	Ihe ndị a bụ ihe dị mkpa n'ezie.
This is how it is done.	Otu a ka o si esi.
But this is not what man wants.	Ma nke a abụghị ihe ahụ mmadụ chọrọ.
Really better than anything his partner gave him.	N'ezie mma karịa ihe ọ bụla ibe ya nyere ya.
One, not many.	Otu, ọ bụghị ọtụtụ.
But in some places, there was no light.	Mana ụfọdụ ebe, enweghị ọkụ.
Her eyes widened.	Anya gbara ya egwu.
I have a burning sensation.	Enwere m mmetụta ọkụ.
Only money is interested.	Ọ bụ naanị ego nwere mmasị.
You are a real woman.	Ị bụ ezigbo nwanyị.
I saw a car in the distance.	Ahụrụ m ụgbọ ala n'ebe dị anya.
They are so beautiful.	Ha mara mma nke ukwuu.
It is easy to stay home.	Ọ dị mfe ịnọ n'ụlọ.
They want to do something.	Ha chọrọ ime ihe.
I have no plans.	Enweghị m atụmatụ.
That can't be done right now.	Enweghị ike ime nke ahụ ugbu a.
It’s best to keep things simple.	Ọ kacha mma ime ka ihe ndị dị mfe dị mfe.
One last trip.	Otu njem ikpeazụ.
That time the four of us.	Oge ahụ anyị anọ.
He ran fast.	Ọ gbara ọsọ ọsọ.
They do not love you.	Ha ahụghị gị n’anya.
There he waited.	N'ebe ahụ ka ọ na-eche.
Our studies have many weaknesses.	Ọmụmụ ihe anyị nwere ọtụtụ adịghị ike.
He said his doctor was still young.	O kwuru na dọkịta ya ka dị obere.
This is cheap, once in a lifetime test.	Nke a bụ ọnụ ala, otu ugboro na ule ndụ.
If it did, it would probably be a success.	Ọ bụrụ na o mee, ọ ga-abụ na a ga-eme ya nke ọma.
I am not my age, obviously.	Adịghị m afọ ndụ m, o doro anya.
She is just a baby.	Ọ bụ naanị nwa ọhụrụ.
He has an awesome eye.	O nwere anya dị egwu.
But he does not do such things.	Ma ọ dịghị eme ihe ndị dị otú ahụ.
It is a very powerful force.	Ọ bụ ike dị ike nke ukwuu.
It was a good trip.	Ọ bụ ezigbo njem.
He has this.	O nwere ihe a.
So did my friends.	Otú ahụ ka mụ na ndị enyi m nọ.
The prisoners had no weapons.	Ndị mkpọrọ ahụ enweghị ngwa ọgụ.
I tried to find some of the pictures for the book.	M gbalịrị ịchọta ụfọdụ n'ime foto ndị ahụ maka akwụkwọ ahụ.
But my attitude is that it is the cause.	Mana omume m bụ na ọ bụ ya kpatara ya.
We have two customers now.	Anyị nwere ndị ahịa abụọ ugbu a.
He is alive.	Ọ dị ndụ.
We want what we do not have.	Anyị chọrọ ihe anyị na-enweghị.
It is the food we eat.	Ọ bụ nri anyị na-eri.

It does not make employees happy.	Ọ naghị eme ka ndị ọrụ nwee obi ụtọ.
He does not seem to be happy about it.	O yighị ka obi dị ya ụtọ maka ya.
How old is this clock?	Awa ole ka elekere ochie a na-agba?
How are you?	Kedu ka ị mere.

There are not many opportunities for work here.	Enweghị ọtụtụ ohere maka ọrụ ebe a.
That’s the only real word here.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị ezigbo okwu ebe a.
He never said what happened to him.	O nweghị mgbe o kwuru ihe mere ya.
No one should know.	Ọ dịghị onye kwesịrị ịma.

Let the children know right away that you are with them.	Mee ka ụmụaka mara ozugbo na gị na ha nọ.
Sometimes for good, others are not.	Mgbe ụfọdụ maka ịdị mma, ndị ọzọ adịghị mma.
This type is known to go to school.	A mara ụdị a ka ọ na-aga n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
But this is different.	Ma nke a dị iche.
He looked at me intently.	O lere m anya nke ọma.

He had traveled so far before.	Ọ gara ebe dị anya otú ahụ tupu mgbe ahụ.
The height should be high.	Elu kwesịrị ịdị elu.

They may know when you are different.	Ha nwere ike ịma mgbe ị dị iche.
We need to talk to them.	Anyị kwesịrị ịgwa ha okwu.
Please come and get me.	Biko bịa were nweta m.
That's not the point.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe.
Everything, both here and there, goes on and on.	Ihe niile, ma ebe a ma ebe ahụ, na-aga n'ihu mgbe niile.
He is in.	Ọ nọ na.
It is absolutely true.	Ọ bụ eziokwu zuru oke.
Their loved one died suddenly.	Onye ha hụrụ n’anya nwụrụ na mberede.
But he shouldn’t act if I don’t know.	Ma o kwesịghị ime ihe ma m maghị.

What is wrong with you?	Kedu ihe na-eme unu?.
A really nice new friend.	Ezigbo enyi ọhụrụ mara mma.

That is where the police station is located.	Ọ bụ ebe ahụ ka ụlọ ọrụ uwe ojii dị.
And by a very low ground.	Na site a ukwuu ala ala.
I live in the city, have a lot of my life.	M bi na obodo, nwere ọtụtụ ndụ m.

This city has a big problem.	Obodo a nwere nnukwu nsogbu.
There are almost two.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ abụọ.
Today is the day of action.	Taa bụ ụbọchị ime ihe.
All you need is the other side of the track.	Ihe niile ị chọrọ bụ n'akụkụ nke ọzọ nke egwu.
It's a good suggestion.	Ọ bụ ezigbo aro.
Of course, we have a hand in it.	N'ezie, anyị nwere aka na ya.
Yesterday the meeting took place.	Ụnyahụ nzukọ ahụ mere.
I am enthusiastic.	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu.

I'm happy.	Obi dị m ụtọ.
You need sailors.	Ị chọrọ ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri.
In a moment, he fell.	Obere oge, ọ dara.
In the afternoon he went to the doctor.	N'ehihie ọ gara ịhụ dọkịta.
I love his work.	Ahụrụ m ọrụ ya n'anya.
For one thing, we now operate three times a week.	Otu ihe bụ na a na-arụ ọrụ ugbu a ugboro atọ n’izu.
So little anything these days.	Ya mere, obere ihe ọ bụla ụbọchị ndị a.
It’s not my job, for me.	Ọ bụghị ọrụ m, maka m.
He was with a friend.	Ya na otu enyi ya nọ.
The application has many features.	Ngwa nwere ọtụtụ atụmatụ.
Of course, just too much power.	N'ezie, naanị ike dị ukwuu.

Of course, there is a lot going on.	N'ezie, enwere ọtụtụ ihe na-eme.

This is really simple.	Nke a dị mfe n'ezie.
It's fun.	Ọ bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ.

The students were terrified.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ahụ gbara egwu egwu.
She seems to know what to do.	O yiri ka ọ̀ ma ihe ọ ga-eme.
I don't know about another place.	Amaghị m maka ebe ọzọ.
His words are beautiful.	Okwu ya mara mma.
The final problem in the head is us.	Nsogbu ikpeazụ na isi bụ anyị.
They both upset you.	Ha abụọ were gị iwe.
He was quick to see.	O mere ngwa ngwa ịhụ.
That is what happened.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe merenụ.
Not much of it, though.	Ọ bụghị ọtụtụ n'ime ya, n'agbanyeghị.
It is one of the questions in this question.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ajụjụ ndị dị na ajụjụ a.
They are children.	Ha bụ ụmụaka.
It will come as one.	Ọ ga-abịa dị ka otu.
The players had their chance this year.	Ndị egwuregwu ahụ nwere ohere ha n'afọ a.
However, it is not good.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mma.
Fear is my favorite kind of movie.	Ụjọ bụ ụdị ihe nkiri kacha amasị m.
That has been true many times.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu ọtụtụ oge.
I really like his song.	Abụ ya na-amasị m nke ukwuu.
We are not going anywhere, we are moving forward.	Anyị agaghị ebe ọ bụla, anyị na-aga n'ihu.
That has an effect.	Nke ahụ nwere mmetụta.
Fast.	Ngwa ngwa.
All cars are running now.	Ụgbọ ala niile na-agba ọsọ ugbu a.
There are four upcoming events.	E nwere ihe omume anọ na-abịa.
Still, he had his time.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, o nwere oge ya.
So this is how it should be.	Ya mere, otu a ka ọ ga-esi dị.
I think you will be fine.	Echere m na ị ga-adị mma.
This was used in two studies.	E ji nke a mee ihe na ọmụmụ ihe abụọ.
Things went on for days.	Ihe na-aga n'ihu ruo ọtụtụ ụbọchị.
They need a home.	Ha chọrọ ụlọ.
That was my main point.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe m niile.
Not all customers are the same.	Ndị ahịa niile abụghị otu.
It was my fault.	Ọ bụ m kpatara ya.
However, he was on the ground once.	Otú ọ dị, ọ nọ na ala otu ugboro.
Of course, I have no idea.	N'ezie, enweghị m echiche banyere ya.
The wife left him.	Nwunye ahụ hapụrụ ya.
But that would be bad.	Ma nke ahụ ga-abụ ihe ọjọọ.
This is the last one.	Nke a bụ nke ikpeazụ.
All of this comes at a price.	Ihe a niile na-abịa na ọnụ ahịa.
Hope to see you then !.	Olileanya ịhụ gị mgbe ahụ!.
There are a number of reasons.	E nwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
He does not do it.	Ọ naghị eme ya.
This is what you have to be, what will happen to you.	Nke a bụ ihe ị ga-abụ, ihe ga-eme gị.
He thought it was funny.	O chere na ọ na-atọ ọchị.
He is not going anywhere now.	Ọ naghị aga ebe ọ bụla ugbu a.
The week before that was.	Na izu tupu nke ahụ bụ.
He has a game.	O nwere egwuregwu.
I am from the same group.	M si n'otu.
However, no such material was found.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị ụdị ihe a hụrụ.
Things seen by chance.	Ihe ahụrụ site na ohere.
I will not let anything happen to me.	Agaghị m ekwe ka ihe mee m.
He really did.	O mere ya n'ezie.
I do not hate myself.	Adịghị m onwe m asị.
I know you will.	Ama m na ị ga-eme ya.
They are very angry.	Ha were ezigbo iwe.
Or wait.	Ma ọ bụ chere.
The customer, on the other hand, makes false promises.	N'aka nke ọzọ, onye ahịa ahụ kwere nkwa ụgha.
Most of it.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
This is one of them.	Nke a bụ otu n'ime ha.
I know how it feels.	Amaara m otú ọ dị.
Tests can be difficult.	Ule nwere ike isi ike.
As you are.	Dị ka ị dị.

It seems to be.	Ọ dị ka ọ bụ.
We are all running fast.	Anyị niile na-agba ọsọ ọsọ.
It works really well for me.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma maka m.
But that did not happen.	Ma, nke ahụ emeghị.
Of course, he knew, in terms of father's behavior.	N'ezie, ọ maara, n'ihe gbasara omume omume nna.
This is not possible.	Nke a agaghị ekwe omume.
It’s a way of time.	Ọ bụ ụzọ oge.
Be a better person.	Bụrụ onye ka mma.
He does not like what we do.	Ihe anyị na-eme adịghị ya mma.
I love meat.	Ahụrụ m anụ n'anya.
So they did.	Ya mere, ha mere.
He got it right away.	O nwetara ya ozugbo.
It may have been his mother's house.	O nwere ike ịbụ ụlọ nne ya.
It was definitely one of the things I did while I was here.	O doro anya na ọ bụ otu n'ime ihe ndị m mere mgbe m nọ ebe a.

This is an important time for our company.	Nke a bụ oge dị mkpa maka ụlọ ọrụ anyị.

But that will not work.	Ma nke ahụ agaghị arụ ọrụ.
My children love it.	Ụmụ m hụrụ ya n'anya.
I challenged myself.	M gbara onwe m aka.
Money, one thing.	Ego, otu ihe.
You know what's out there.	Ị maara ihe dị n'ebe ahụ.
In fact, it seems so.	N'ezie, o yiri nnọọ ka ọ bụ eziokwu.
Proceed for your life.	Gaa n'ihu maka ndụ gị.
He was obviously looking for me.	O doro anya na ọ na-achọ m.
He got that from you.	O nwetara nke ahụ n'aka gị.
There are no studies on this issue.	Enweghị ọmụmụ ihe na-ekwu maka okwu a.
He died years later.	Ọ nwụrụ kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
Only then did he speak.	Naanị mgbe ahụ ka o kwuru okwu.
The children love it.	Ụmụaka hụrụ ya n'anya.
He did so at dinner.	O mere otú ahụ n'oge nri abalị.
Sometimes things are in your head, like.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ihe dị gị n'isi, dị ka.
Both are the best way.	Ha abụọ bụ ụzọ kacha mma.
I don't want any more children.	Achọghị m ụmụaka ọzọ.
He knew he could do it.	Ọ maara na ya nwere ike ime ya.
This family is a rural thing.	Ezinụlọ a bụ ihe dị n'ime obodo.
Girl, or so it is said.	Nwa agbọghọ, ma ọ bụ otú ahụ ka e kwuru.
He now has friends.	O nwere ndị enyi ugbu a.
The place is right next to it.	Ebe ahụ dị n'akụkụ ya.
Of course, in a small third room.	N'ezie, na obere ụlọ nke atọ.
Let me tell you now, but not one word for another.	Ka m gwa gị ugbu a, mana ọ bụghị otu okwu nye onye ọzọ.
May you all do.	Ka unu niile mere.
Love him love you love him.	Hụrụ ya n'anya hụ ya n'anya hụ ya n'anya.
Everyone is good, more or less.	Onye ọ bụla dị mma, karịa ma ọ bụ obere.
But not so.	Ma ndị dị otú ahụ agaghị adị otú ahụ.
There was no one in front of him.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ihu ya.
Knowing, she is beautiful.	Ebe ọ ma, ọ mara mma.
I know that's useful, but.	Ama m na nke ahụ bara uru, mana.
There is no value in that.	Enweghị ọnụ ahịa nke ahụ.
I don’t think anyone can.	Echeghị m na onye ọ bụla nwere ike.
The team is traveling now.	Ndị otu ahụ na-eme njem ugbu a.
Get your message.	Nweta ozi gị.
Good for students with new rewards !.	Ọ dị mma maka ụmụ akwụkwọ na ụgwọ ọrụ ọhụrụ!.
He needed an illustration.	Ọ chọrọ ihe atụ.
There is no good reason.	O nweghị ezigbo ihe kpatara ya.
Can you help?	Ị nwere ike inye aka?.
That’s what we’re here for really.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị nọ ebe a n'ezie.
Suddenly, it was just there.	Na mberede, ọ bụ naanị ebe ahụ.
Enough light for me to see.	Ọkụ zuru oke ka m hụ.
Most people will look for opportunities.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ga-achọ ohere.

One girl was almost as weak as he was with her.	Otu nwa agbọghọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ ghara ịdị ike dị ka ya na ya nọ.

He sees that now.	Ọ hụrụ nke ahụ ugbu a.
No questions about it.	Enweghị ajụjụ gbasara ya.
Well, more so.	Ọ dị mma, ka ukwuu.
No, this is not true.	Mba, nke a abụghị eziokwu.

She gave him a small smile.	O nyere ya ntakịrị ọnụ ọchị.
In fact, he was right.	Nke bụ́ eziokwu bụ na o kwuru eziokwu.

But if you do not know, you will not believe.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ị maghị, ị gaghị ekwe.
The phone rang very loudly.	Ekwentị ahụ dara nke ukwuu.
It is easy to see why this is so.	Ọ dị mfe ịhụ ihe mere nke a ji dị otú a.
Please visit this page for more information.	Biko gaa na ibe a maka ozi ndị ọzọ.
But I feel like it's on fire.	Mana ọ dị m ka ọ na-agba ọkụ.
We have fresh water.	Anyị nwere mmiri ọhụrụ.
I want to love you here.	Achọrọ m ịhụ gị n'anya ebe a.
Not when there is something useful and problematic.	Ọ bụghị mgbe e nwere ihe bara uru na nsogbu.
Any job is better than no job.	Ọrụ ọ bụla dị mma karịa enweghị ọrụ.
From a distance, it was awkward.	Site n'ebe dị anya, ọ nọ na-adịghị mma.
I hope we become friends.	Enwere m olileanya na anyị ga-abụ enyi.
There could be a variety of reasons for this.	Enwere ike inwe ihe dị iche iche kpatara nke a.
I'm happy here.	Obi dị m ụtọ ebe a.
I think it is true.	Echere m na ọ bụ eziokwu.
He did not know why.	Ọ maghị ihe kpatara ya.
We can get a job.	Anyị nwere ike nweta ọrụ.
But one that is clearly important.	Ma otu nke o doro anya na ọ dị mkpa.
The car is very low.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ dị nnọọ ala.
And I sought him.	M wee chọọ ya.
I can see it.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ya.
Small is a small pet.	Obere ihe bụ obere anụ ụlọ.
The couple has two children.	Di na nwunye ahụ nwere ụmụ abụọ.
The city was full of people.	Obodo ahụ juru ebe niile.
No time to think about it, you know.	Enweghị oge iche echiche banyere ya, ị maara.
It's very simple.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe.
Anyone can see the dog is still there.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ike ịhụ nkịta ka nọ ebe ahụ.
His feelings are similar.	Mmetụta ya yiri nke ya.
She is obviously planning on going somewhere.	O doro anya na ọ na-eme atụmatụ ịga ebe.
I eat something that makes me happy and healthy.	M na-eri ihe na-eme m obi ụtọ na ahụ ike.
But that is not the case.	Mana ikpe ahụ abụghị ikpe a.
I want you to talk to me.	Achọrọ m ka ị gwa m okwu.
Everything is very nice and very nice.	Ihe niile nwere ezigbo mma ma mara mma nke ukwuu.
Really bad.	Ihe ọjọọ n'ezie.
The book is recommended.	A na-atụ aro akwụkwọ ahụ.
He needs weapons.	Ọ chọrọ ngwa ọgụ.
He fell behind a small paper bag.	Ọ dara n'azụ obere akpa akwụkwọ.
He saw it immediately.	Ọ hụrụ ya ozugbo.
It's funny.	Ọ bụ ihe ọchị.
As reasonable as it may be.	Dị ka ezi uche dị na ya.
We look forward to having that this year.	Anyị na-atụ anya inwe nke ahụ n'afọ a.
Money is not the only benefit.	Ọnụ ego abụghị naanị uru.
Events.	Ihe omume.
We are sure he is guilty.	Anyị ji n'aka na ikpe mara ya.
It is actually a small beautiful place.	Ọ bụ n'ezie obere ebe mara mma.
There are a few big problems with it.	Enwere nnukwu nsogbu ole na ole na ya.
He has time.	O nwere oge.
The same can be said for the work environment.	Enwere ike ikwu otu ihe ahụ maka gburugburu ebe ọrụ.
I am not like anyone else.	Adịghị m ka onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
Our path is different.	Ụzọ anyị si aga dị iche.
It was in the water.	Ọ nọ na mmiri.
The thought frightened me at first.	Echiche ahụ tụrụ m ụjọ na mbụ.
Much more on this tomorrow.	Ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ na nke a echi.
The accident will happen soon.	Ihe mberede a ga-eme n'oge adịghị anya.
Pretty much, it's not.	Ọ mara mma ikwu, ọ naghị eme.
The mother said so.	Nne kwuru otú ahụ.
Each of us is.	Onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị bụ.
Babies need the strong feelings of a mother.	Ụmụaka chọrọ mmetụta siri ike nke nne.
And you are my friend, that is.	Na ị bụ enyi m, ya bụ.
I can see why people would be interested.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ihe mere ndị mmadụ ga-eji nwee mmasị.
It's hard for no idea.	O siri ike maka enweghị echiche.
Things that are important in the first place, of course.	Ihe ndị dị mkpa na mbụ, n'ezie.
I am satisfied here.	Ebe a juru m afọ.
We still wish you success.	Anyị ka chọrọ ka ị nwee ihe ịga nke ọma.
Again, thank you very much.	Ọzọ, daalụ nke ukwuu.
It continues in character.	Ọ na-aga n'ihu na agwa.
But he has.	Ma o nwere.
It is a feeling he is well aware of.	Ọ bụ mmetụta ọ maara nke ọma.
That is not the reason.	Ọ bụghị ya kpatara ya.
I didn’t spend much time thinking about that, anyway.	Ejighị m oge dị ukwuu na-eche banyere nke ahụ, n'agbanyeghị.
Many questions.	Ọtụtụ ajụjụ.
This does not work anymore.	Nke a anaghị arụ ọrụ ọzọ.
That would be the case for the courts.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ ọnọdụ nke ụlọ ikpe.
The students are pointless.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ndị ahụ enweghị isi.
He is doing well.	Ọ na-eme nke ọma.
He knew he would be on time for an important meeting.	Ọ ma na ya ga-abịa n’oge maka nzukọ dị mkpa.
I hope you will be here.	Enwere m olileanya na ị ga-anọ ebe a.
But you can still feel it.	Ma ị ka nwere ike inwe mmetụta.
This letter is for you.	Akwụkwọ ozi a bụ maka ya.
I have everyone looking for it.	Enwere m onye ọ bụla na-achọ ya.
This city was a great harbor in ancient times.	Obodo a bụ nnukwu ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri n'oge ochie.
First, he reads.	Nke mbụ, ọ na-agụ akwụkwọ.
The stranger began to speak.	Onye ala ọzọ ahụ malitere ikwu okwu.
Making such statements may be necessary.	Ikwu ihe ndị dị otú ahụ nwere ike ịdị mkpa.
But we can not.	Ma anyị enweghị ike.
Then he was still there.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ ka nọ.
It hurts me.	Ọ na-eme m ihe.
It can't be here.	O nweghị ike ịnọ ebe a.
There is only one thing we must do.	Naanị otu ihe ka anyị ga-eme.
He did all he could.	O mere ihe niile o nwere ike ime.
None of us said much in the car.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị kwuru ọtụtụ ihe n'ime ụgbọ ala ahụ.
Most of them, of course.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha, n'ezie.
He hurried to another house.	Ọ gara ngwa ngwa gaa ụlọ ọzọ.
No one is doing it well.	Ọ dịghị onye na-eme ya nke ọma.
That was the perfect weekend trip.	Nke ahụ bụ njem izu ụka zuru oke.
Attend meetings today.	Gaa nzukọ taa.
Their style is very friendly.	Ụdị ha dị nnọọ enyi.
They do not love one another.	Ahụghị ibe ha n'anya.
You will be strong.	Ị ga-adị ike.
No doubt it is important, though.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na ọ dị mkpa, n'agbanyeghị.
I was his only hope, the only one who cared about it.	Abụ m naanị olileanya ya, naanị onye na-eche banyere ya.
He put them on his head.	O tinyere ha n'isi ya.
Can't be good.	Enweghị ike ịdị mma.
This app is so much fun.	Ngwa a na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
That’s the thing, he thinks.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe, ọ na-eche.
This boy is here.	Nwa nwoke a nọ ebe a.
No one has a pretty good time.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere oge mara mma doro anya.
The third is awesome.	Nke atọ dị egwu.
One plant for every meal.	Otu osisi maka nri ọ bụla.
Of course, many.	N'ezie, ọtụtụ.
He invited his friends over for dinner.	Ọ kpọrọ ndị enyi ya rie nri abalị.
It's hard to enjoy.	O siri ike ime ihe ụtọ.
The fire is dancing a lot.	Ọkụ na-agba egwu nke ukwuu.
No two periods of time are the same.	Ọ dịghị oge abụọ n'ime oge bụ otu.
You are a teacher.	Ị bụ onye nkuzi.
You have no real friends at the new school.	Ị nweghị enyi n'ezie n'ụlọ akwụkwọ ọhụrụ ahụ.
It is important not to fast.	Ọ dị mkpa ka ị ghara ibu ọnụ.
But, you know, you read a lot.	Ma, ị mara, ị na-agụ ọtụtụ ihe.
It can be scary, though.	O nwere ike ịdị egwu ikwu, mana.
One has to do something about it.	Mmadụ kwesịrị ime ihe banyere nke ahụ.
I know why.	Amaara m ihe kpatara ya.
I never understood them.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m ghọtara ha.
He went ahead of the store.	Ọ gara n'ihu ụlọ ahịa ahụ.
That is a lie.	Nke ahụ bụ ụgha.
It works for me.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka m.
You can do what you can.	Ị nwere ike ime ihe dị gị n'aka.
Anger overwhelmed him.	Iwe karịrị ya.
He thought he did not like it at the bar.	O chere na ọ naghị amasị onye nọ n'ụlọ mmanya ahụ.
He knew what a woman's family might look like.	Ọ maara otú ezinụlọ ụmụ nwanyị nwere ike ịdị ka.
I just had no idea.	M nnọọ enweghị echiche.
I would like a baby.	Nwa nwa ga-amasị m.
That is why we must act.	Ọ bụ ya mere anyị ga-eji mee ihe.
He has his own place.	O nwere ebe nke ya.
One man said that he only wanted to give me money.	Otu nwoke kwuru na ọ chọrọ naanị inye m ego.
It is a company with good people.	Ọ bụ ụlọ ọrụ nwere ezigbo mmadụ.
Do both.	Mee ihe abụọ ahụ.
For me, that’s useful for things.	Maka m, nke ahụ bara uru maka ihe.
So, you know, it's kind of a big deal.	Ya mere, ị maara, ọ bụ ụdị nnukwu ihe.
Laughter is awesome.	Ọchị ọchị dị egwu.
Maybe that’s all.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ ihe niile ahụ.
It seems they know me.	Ọ dị ka ha ma m.
They need food and water.	Ha chọrọ nri na mmiri mmiri.
That was his idea of ​​making that a little bit different.	Nke ahụ bụ echiche ya ime ka nke ahụ dị ntakịrị.
I will not see him fall.	Agaghị m ahụ ya ka ọ dara.
As you do.	Dị ka ị na-eme.
I would say friend.	Aga m asị enyi.
It was hard to do it the first two years.	O siri ike ime ya afọ abụọ mbụ ya.
He thought of the woman.	O chere banyere nwanyị ahụ.
Nothing else is mentioned.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ e kwuru banyere ya.
That was now four years ago.	Nke ahụ bụ ugbu a afọ anọ gara aga.
He is the main runner.	Ọ bụ isi na-agba ọsọ ahụ.
There is no one like him.	Ọ dịghị onye dị ka ya.
He looked old to me.	O lere anya ochie n'anya m.
Everyone loves it.	Onye ọ bụla hụrụ ya n'anya.
There is no reason to doubt it.	Ọ dịghị ihe mere anyị ga-eji na-enwe obi abụọ.
Know your rights.	Mara ikike gị.
About my behavior like anything else.	Banyere omume nke m dị ka ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
My two friends and I went to a party at home.	Mụ na ndị enyi m abụọ gara oriri n’ụlọ.
Humorous, no doubt.	Ihe ọchị, obi abụọ adịghị ya.
Any man can see that.	Nwoke ọ bụla nwere ike ịhụ nke ahụ.
You miss home.	Ị na-atụ uche ụlọ.
If something goes wrong, can you tell me?	Ọ bụrụ na ihe adịghị mma, ị nwere ike ịgwa m?
We know that now.	Anyị maara nke ahụ ugbu a.
There was a problem at the port.	Enwere nsogbu n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri.
Sometimes they talk a little.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha na-ekwu ntakịrị okwu.
But this does not have to be true.	Mana nke a ekwesịghị ịbụ eziokwu.
Can you see the loft?	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ụlọ elu dị elu?
It does not make sense.	Ọ naghị eme ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
Such thinking is rational.	Ụdị echiche dị otú ahụ bụ ezi uche nke gị.
We do not know, of course, who belongs to him.	Anyị amaghị, n'ezie, onye bụ nke ya.
Spirit in the store.	Mmụọ n'ime ụlọ ahịa.
That would be great.	Nke ahụ ga-adị ezigbo mma.
But no one was in front.	Ma ọ dịghị onye nọ n'ihu.
I have a friend and we will be fine.	Enwere m enyi na anyị ga-adị mma.
In that situation.	Na ọnọdụ ahụ.
Words for that.	Okwu maka nke ahụ.
This is not true.	Nke a abụghị eziokwu.
He took place at the door.	O were ọnọdụ n'ọnụ ụzọ.
so sweet.	dị oke ụtọ.
You know what they say.	Ị maara ihe ha na-ekwu.
I do not understand the situation better than you.	Aghọtaghị m ọnọdụ ahụ karịa gị.
Like a restaurant.	Dị ka ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
They realize that they are not alone.	Ha ghọtara na ha anọghị naanị ha.
First, it is not cheap.	Nke mbụ, ọ bụghị ọnụ ala.
Easy to do.	Dị mfe ime.
They are not there.	Ha anọghị ebe ahụ.
This is a friendly city.	Nke a bụ obodo enyi.
I need new shoes.	Achọrọ m akpụkpọ ụkwụ ọhụrụ.
What else?	Kedu ihe ọzọ?
You can do anything.	Ị nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla.
That surprised me.	Nke ahụ tụrụ m n'anya.
One like yours.	Otu dị ka nke gị.
It is his favorite kind of travel.	Ọ bụ ụdị njem kacha amasị ya.
You have to go somewhere else.	Ị ga-aga ebe ọzọ.
I am enthusiastic.	Ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu.
The store is near my house.	Ụlọ ahịa ahụ dị nso n'akụkụ ụlọ m.
You can't go to the hospital.	Ị gaghị aga ụlọ ọgwụ.
We certainly had a wonderful time.	O doro anya na anyị nwere oge mara mma.
Of course he never did.	N'ezie ọ dịghị mgbe ọ na-eme otú ahụ.
Of course, there will be some limitations.	N'ezie, a ga-enwe oke ụfọdụ.
Like last night.	Dị ka abalị ikpeazụ.
But now, every word seems a little better.	Ma ugbu a, okwu ọ bụla dị ka obere mma.
Thanks for the great information !.	Daalụ maka nnukwu ozi!.
They do things.	Ha na-eme ihe.
He ate only food.	Ọ na-eri naanị ihe oriri.
I love this so much.	Ahụrụ m nke a n'anya nke ukwuu.
The house is not good.	Ụlọ ahụ adịghị mma.
But this is not wrong.	Ma, nke a adịghị njọ.
One needs to think carefully.	Mmadụ kwesịrị iche echiche nke ọma.
It is a promise and a way of being.	Ọ bụ nkwa na ụzọ nke ịbụ.
Now it has a small gift shop.	Ugbu a ọ nwere obere ụlọ ahịa ihe onyinye.
But, of course, there is no good reason not to.	Mana, n'ezie, ọ nweghị ezigbo ihe kpatara na ọ bụghị.
That is the city's job.	Ọ bụ ya bụ ọrụ obodo ahụ.
Several days may be fine for me.	Ọtụtụ ụbọchị nwere ike ịdị m mma.
It’s obviously hard, though.	O doro anya na ọ siri ike, n'agbanyeghị.
These roads are awesome.	Ụzọ ndị a dị egwu.
He called me today.	Ọ kpọrọ m taa.
Winter can be cold.	Oge oyi nwere ike ịdị oyi.
And he went on like this.	O wee gaa n'ihu otu a.
Please let me know when it is over.	Biko mee ka m mara mgbe ọ mechara.
He did not want it.	Ọ chọghị ya.
Not good for men, but it's true.	Ọ dịghị mma maka ụmụ nwoke, mana ọ bụ eziokwu.
I'm not sure it works.	Adịghị m n'aka na ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
But he did not want it.	Ma ọ chọghị ya.
The body is perfect.	Ahụ ahụ zuru oke.
This is a good thing.	Nke a bụ ezigbo ihe.
He was the last friend she left.	Ọ bụ ya bụ enyi ikpeazụ hapụrụ ya.
But his hopes were not realized.	Ma ihe ọ tụrụ anya ya abụghị ihe ọ ghọtara.
We do not want it.	Anyị achọghị ya.
You got me.	Ị nwetara m.
There are many examples where this is known.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe atụ ebe a maara nke a.
And sometimes cruelty.	Na mgbe ụfọdụ, obi ọjọọ obi ọjọọ.
It's so easy !.	Ọ dị mfe otú ahụ!.
No one said anything.	O nweghị onye kwuru ihe ọ bụla.
That is the only truth.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị eziokwu.
His stomach is in his mouth.	Afọ ya dị n'ọnụ ya.
I can do better.	Enwere m ike ime ihe ọma.
Sit by the window during the day.	Nọdụ ala n'akụkụ windo n'ehihie.
This is the place.	Nke a bụ ebe ahụ.
But basically, you can’t charge for our game.	Mana n'ụzọ bụ isi, ị nweghị ike ịgba ụgwọ maka egwuregwu anyị.
But there is no work to do.	Ma ọ dịghị ọrụ ime otú ahụ.
You will be.	Ị ga-abụ.
Law can help, of course.	Iwu nwere ike inye aka, n'ezie.
The games are tough, but it's fun.	Egwuregwu ndị ahụ siri ike, mana ọ na-atọ ụtọ.
But this is very restless in terms of speed.	Ma na nke a dị nnọọ zuru ike na okwu nke ọsọ.
So let it be then.	Ya mere ka ọ bụrụ mgbe ahụ.
From there he walked into the room.	Ọ si ebe ahụ na-aga n'ọnụ ụlọ.
This truth is very important to me.	Eziokwu a dị m nke ukwuu.
You are my.	Ị bụ.
That was his biggest problem.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu nsogbu ya.
We did everything well.	Anyị mere ihe niile nke ọma.
Again, this seems logical.	Ọzọ, nke a yiri ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
I'll stay here.	Aga m anọ ebe a.
Most of them are.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha bụ.
He had an idea.	O nwere echiche.
Some people will like this.	Ụfọdụ ndị ga-amasị nke a.
Just let it run.	Naanị ka ọ na-agba.
I don't think that's what he's looking for.	Echeghị m na ọ bụ ihe ọ na-achọ.
I like work.	Ọrụ na-amasị m.
You are a good friend.	Ị bụ ezigbo enyi.
He had his time.	O nwere oge ọ nọ na ya.
The people are angry.	Ndị obodo ahụ were iwe.
They are the last ones left.	Ha bụ ndị ikpeazụ hapụrụ.
More than that.	Karịrị mgbe ahụ.
Do your homework.	Mee ihe omume ụlọ akwụkwọ gị.
It fits well.	Ọ dara nke ọma.
It is different.	Ọ dị iche.
In the spirit of who we are as a community.	Na mmụọ nke onye anyị bụ dị ka obodo.
But you will feel better in a few days.	Mana ahụ ga-adị gị mma n'ime ụbọchị ole na ole.
That says something.	Nke ahụ na-ekwu ihe.
The beautiful weather we have!	Ihu igwe mara mma anyị na-enwe!
A house is a house.	Ụlọ bụ ụlọ.
It's an awesome game.	Ọ bụ egwuregwu dị egwu.
Few people rejected the practice.	Ọ bụ mmadụ ole na ole jụrụ omume ahụ.
They are in the stable.	Ha nọ n'ụlọ anụ ezi.
So he did.	Ya mere, o mere ihe.
The water stopped flowing.	Mmiri ahụ kwụsịrị.
People were coming and going.	Ndị mmadụ nọ na-abịa ma na-aga.
But it is beautiful.	Mana ọ mara mma.
There are now two main ideas.	Ugbu a enwere echiche abụọ bụ isi.
What you said.	Ihe i kwuru.
Nice, great bed linen.	Dị mma, akwa akwa akwa.
I hope there is a better way to do this.	Enwere m olileanya na e nwere ụzọ ka mma isi mee nke a.
This room is very nice.	Ime ụlọ a dị ezigbo mma.
For us, nothing is more important.	Maka anyị, ọ nweghị ihe dị mkpa karịa.
He may be alone.	O nwere ike ịbụ onye naanị ya.
It is our story.	Ọ bụ akụkọ anyị.
Clearly, they have a strong need for a leader.	O doro anya na ha nwere mkpa siri ike maka onye isi.
It should be there.	Ọ kwesịrị ịdị n'ebe ahụ.
If the book had not been for him.	A sị na akwụkwọ ahụ agaraghị ya.
I saw it happen.	Ahụrụ m ya ka ọ na-eme.
One by water.	Otu site na mmiri.
I hope to find a job.	Enwere m olileanya ịchọta ọrụ.
However, it can be seen again.	Kedu ka ọ dị, enwere ike ịhụ ya ọzọ.
There are almost four.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ anọ.
I can't cry very well.	Enweghị m ike ime ezigbo anya mmiri.
In it, there are many customer rights.	Na ya, e nwere ọtụtụ ikike ndị ahịa.
A way to see who can play.	Ụzọ ịhụ onye nwere ike igwu egwu.
We take this very seriously.	Anyị ji nke a kpọrọ ihe.
You have to get out of here.	Ị ga-esi ebe a pụọ.
I want to make you suffer.	Achọrọ m ime ka ị taa ahụhụ.
That's enough.	Nke ahụ zuru.
Important for such a boy.	Ihe dị mkpa maka nwa nwoke dị otú ahụ.
I still think about it.	M ka na-eche banyere ya.
The second event.	Ihe omume nke abụọ.
This is the first time you have seen her picture.	Nke a bụ nke mbụ ị hụrụ foto ya.
He knew we were there.	Ọ ma na anyị nọ ebe ahụ.
The last question may be this question.	Ajụjụ ikpeazụ nwere ike ịbụ ajụjụ a.
We need a vacation.	Anyị chọrọ ezumike.
And money, news, anything.	Na ego, akụkọ, ihe ọ bụla.
their weakness is obvious.	adịghị ike ha doro anya.
I am happy of it.	Enwere m obi ụtọ nke ya.
Some may be small.	Ụfọdụ nwere ike ịbụ obere.
Some awesome things can happen on this trip.	Ụfọdụ ihe dị egwu nwere ike ime na njem a.
He tried one last time.	Ọ gbalịrị otu oge ikpeazụ.
I do not want to go out with anyone.	Enweghị m mmasị iso onye ọ bụla pụọ.
He can get everything now.	O nwere ike nweta ihe niile ugbu a.
We’re stubborn, man.	Anyị na-agba ya isi ike, nwoke.
This should be an immediate message.	Nke a kwesịrị ịbụ ozi dị ngwa ngwa.
Most of what he did was nothing.	Ọtụtụ ihe o mere abụghị ihe ọ bụla.
You need it more than anyone else.	Ị chọrọ ya karịa onye ọ bụla.
I think it's funny.	Echere m na ọ bụ ihe ọchị.
Let this be the place.	Ka ebe a bụrụ.
Otherwise, it leaves.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ pụọ.
We had tears in our eyes.	Anya gbara anyị mmiri.
Or something similar.	Ma ọ bụ ihe yiri ya.
What he did.	Ihe o mere.
If that is your intention.	Ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ bụ uche gị.
So close and beautiful.	Ya mere nso na mara mma.
I doubt it is true.	Enwere m obi abụọ na ọ bụ eziokwu.
They had an opportunity.	Ohere bịara ha were ya.
The man's wife is an actress.	Nwunye nwoke ahụ bụ onye na-eme ihe nkiri.
There is no excuse for anger.	O nweghị ihe ga-eme ka onye ọ bụla were iwe.
Like it or not, it is a fact of life.	Ọ masịrị ya ma ọ bụ na ọ chọghị, ọ bụ eziokwu nke ndụ.
I can not call.	Enweghị m ike ịkpọ.
He looked at his employer.	O lere onye were ya n’ọrụ anya.
All three did not succeed.	Ụdị atọ ahụ emeghị nke ọma.
I do it again.	M na-eme ya ọzọ.
Things will happen.	Ihe ga-eme.
That may be one way to keep them from running their race.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ otu ụzọ isi mee ka ọ ghara ịdị na-agba ọsọ ha.
The water here is very clear.	Mmiri ebe a doro anya nke ọma.
That is what he is saying there.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ na-ekwu n'ebe ahụ.
This is important for many people.	Nke a dị ọtụtụ mmadụ mkpa.
He says we should be worse.	O kwuru na anyị kwesịrị ịdị njọ karịa.
By car, the city is two hours from here.	Site na ụgbọ ala, obodo ahụ dị awa abụọ site ebe a.
Continue looking for his bag.	Gaa n'ihu na-achọ akpa ya.
I am their friend.	Abụ m enyi ha.
Or for money.	Ma ọ bụ maka ego.
Thank you for what you have.	Daalụ maka ihe ị nwere.
It is my gift that I cannot do.	Ọ bụ onyinye m nke enweghị ike ime.

I want them all to be different.	Achọrọ m ka ha niile dị iche.

No one knows very well.	Ọ dịghị onye maara nke ọma.

He looks like his grandfather.	O yiri nna nna ya.
No one should doubt that.	Ọ dịghị onye kwesịrị inwe obi abụọ banyere nke ahụ.

But that is what they thought.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ihe ha chere.
And everything is ready.	Na ihe niile dị njikere.

This food is very bad.	Nri a dị nnọọ njọ.
He wants first and he wants things now.	Ọ chọrọ mbụ na ọ chọrọ ihe ugbu a.
The court initially asked what our client said.	Ụlọ ikpe na mbụ jụrụ ihe onye ahịa anyị kwuru.

There are no dogs anywhere.	Enweghị nkịta ọ bụla ebe ọ bụla.
Would you like someone to tell me what's going on?	Ọ ga-amasị mmadụ ịgwa m ihe na-eme?
But the passengers were not human.	Mana ndị njem ahụ abụghị mmadụ.

Long life to him!	Ogologo ndụ nye ya!
He stays there a long time.	Ọ nọrọ ebe ahụ ogologo oge.
He works a lot of the time.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ ọtụtụ oge.
He was angry.	Iwe were ya.
Hence the movie's title.	N'ihi ya, ihe nkiri aha.
Our challenge is to see what we have.	Ihe ịma aka anyị bụ ịhụ ihe anyị nwere.
Once there is a small town here.	Ozugbo e nwere obere obodo ebe a.

It is one of my favorite places to go.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ebe kacha amasị m ịga.
It’s all awesome.	Ọ bụ ihe niile dị egwu.
The only thing he saw was what was to come.	Naanị ihe ọ hụrụ bụ ihe na-abịa.
There is no power in him.	Ike adịghị n'aka ya.
That is the best.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe kacha mma.
My question is here.	Ajụjụ m dị ebe a.
He needed his help.	Enyemaka akpa ya dị ya mkpa.
My father works night shifts.	Nna m na-arụ ọrụ abalị.
More than necessary.	Ụzọ karịa ka ọ dị mkpa.
I do not want too much.	Achọghị m nke ukwuu.
What is clear is that we know very little.	Ihe doro anya bụ na anyị maara ntakịrị ihe.

You have time.	Ị nwere oge.

The food has many flavors.	Nri ahụ nwere ọtụtụ ihe.
When we were little, it was never talked about.	Mgbe anyị dị obere, ọ dịghị mgbe a na-ekwu banyere ya.
His face looked back, the same.	Ihu ya lere ya anya azụ, otu ahụ.
He immediately went that way.	Ọ gara ozugbo n'ụzọ ahụ.

He was at the door, ready to go out.	Ọ nọ n'ọnụ ụzọ, dị njikere ịpụ.
Please take a moment.	Biko nọrọ obere oge.
It will not be used.	A gaghị eji ya mee ihe.
That would be nice.	Nke ahụ gaara adị mma.
That's when he realized.	Ọ bụ mgbe ahụ ka ọ ghọtara.
Children experience violent emotions.	Ụmụaka na-enwe mmetụta uche na-eme ihe ike.
I think it’s awesome.	Echere m na ọ bụ egwu.
You are a person.	Ị bụ onye.

There is some truth to that, and that is not a problem.	Enwere ụfọdụ eziokwu na nke ahụ, na nke ahụ abụghị nsogbu.
There is very little drinking water.	Enwere mmiri ọṅụṅụ ole na ole.

He’s not a terrible person.	Ọ bụghị onye dị egwu.

Cold winter, cold people.	Oyi oyi, oyi ndị mmadụ.

How to do certain things and if.	Otu esi eme ihe ụfọdụ na ọ bụrụ.

He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.

I do not do it.	Anaghị m eme ya.
This is a way of thinking in the past.	Nke a bụ ụzọ iche echiche n'oge gara aga.
Once a week, children attend dance lessons.	Otu ugboro n'izu, ụmụaka na-aga nkuzi ịgba egwu.
Every time.	Oge ọ bụla.
Temporary.	Nwa oge.
For this, he wants you.	Maka nke a, ọ chọrọ gị.

He wanted to know what he was thinking.	Ọ chọrọ ịma ihe ọ na-eche.

I saw a great laugh.	Ahụrụ m otu nnukwu ọchị.

The morning was very pleasant.	Ụtụtụ na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
What a beautiful house this is.	Kedu ụlọ mara mma nke a bụ.
But we do it for a good reason.	Ma anyị na-eme ya maka ezi ihe kpatara ya.

Now, it is clear how to use it.	Ugbu a, o doro anya ka esi eji ya.
I think my house.	Echere m ụlọ m.
We are still waiting for it.	Anyị ka na-eche ya.
Nothing will happen to him.	Ọ dịghị ihe ga-eme ya.
Now no one lives there.	Ugbu a, ọ dịghị onye bi n'ebe ahụ.
There is light in every window.	Ọkụ dị na windo ọ bụla.
But he wanted to do only one.	Ma ọ chọrọ ime naanị otu.
It was done the other day.	E mere ya ụbọchị gara aga.
He is very angry.	O were iwe nke ukwuu.
He left the one he had told him for the last time.	Ọ hapụrụ nke ọ gwara ya maka ikpeazụ.
People might think it is windows.	Ndị mmadụ nwere ike iche na ọ bụ windo.
He did it.	O mere ya.

That is the key.	Nke ahụ bụ isi ihe niile.
The event was awesome.	Ihe omume ahụ bụ ihe egwu.
This happened last week.	Ihe a mere n'izu gara aga.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
You stopped early.	Ị kwụsịrị n'oge.
They will not have you.	Ha agaghị enwe gị.

He told her not to go out.	Ọ gwara ya ka ọ ghara ịpụ.
I will be your eye.	M ga-abụ anya gị.
You know more than this city.	Ị mara ihe karịa obodo a.
Just like the truth of history.	Dị nnọọ ka eziokwu nke akụkọ ihe mere eme.
Which way are they going?	Kedu ụzọ ha si aga?
Do something that works.	Mee ihe na-arụ ọrụ.
We had a lot of good times.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ oge dị mma.
There is a backlash.	Enwere azụ azụ.
Mostly, it is because of fear.	Ọtụtụ, ọ bụ n'ihi egwu.
There are a few reasons for this.	Enwere ihe ole na ole kpatara nke ahụ.
I think everyone knows that.	Echere m na onye ọ bụla maara nke ahụ.
They have a different function.	Ha nwere ọrụ dị iche.
More than the original idea.	Karịa echiche mbụ.
A horror group has a lot of great musicians.	Otu egwu egwu egwu nwere ọtụtụ ndị egwu egwu.
But it was one of those nights.	Ma ọ bụ otu n'ime abalị ndị ahụ.
Some people dance.	Ụfọdụ ndị na-agba egwu.
This will not work.	Nke a agaghị arụ ọrụ.
This is my favorite thing.	Nke a bụ ihe masịrị m.
The water is very cold.	Mmiri ahụ bụ ezigbo oyi.
She is your wife.	Ọ bụ nwunye gị.

You need to make sure that they are drinking well.	I kwesịrị ịhụ ka ha na-aṅụ ihe ọṅụṅụ na-aṅụ.
Then he had another idea.	Mgbe ahụ, o nwere echiche ọzọ.
They were there, then they were not.	Ha nọ ebe ahụ, mgbe ahụ ha anọghị.
Her husband left.	Di ya hapụrụ.
Round about, this plan seems to work for me.	Gburugburu gburugburu, atụmatụ a yiri ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka m.
Mother is that true? 	Nne ọ bụ eziokwu?

Someone fell into a ditch.	Onye dara n'ime akwa mmiri.
Sometimes it succeeds.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ na-aga nke ọma.
His mother was delighted.	Nne ya nwere ụtọ ụtọ.

No action, you said.	Enweghị omume, ị kwuru.
This for the moment should be it.	Nke a maka oge kwesịrị ịbụ ya.
This is because there is no one.	Nke a bụ n'ihi na ọ dịghị otu.
The weather is nice to go by.	Ihu igwe ahụ dị mma aga n'ihu.
It is absolutely pointless.	Ọ bụ nnọọ enweghị isi.

You can get it.	Enwere ike ị nweta ya.
And the sooner he will do that the better.	Na ngwa ngwa ọ ga-eme nke ahụ ka mma.
Of course it is beautiful.	N'ezie ọ bụ ihe mara mma.

But we are not all the same.	Ma anyị niile abụghị otu.
Things you should know, and know well now.	Ihe ị kwesịrị ịma, ma mara nke ọma ugbu a.
If you can help anyone, you must help them.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike inyere onye ọ bụla aka, ị ga-enyere ha aka.
We want to know what you think.	Anyị chọrọ ịma ihe ị chere.
I'll go now.	Aga m aga ugbu a.
His photo after he was beautiful.	Foto ya mgbe o mechara mara mma.
He made friends easily.	O mere ndị enyi n'ụzọ dị mfe.
Pretty good, a lot of it.	Ihe mara mma nke ọma, ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
But it is really marketing.	Ma ọ bụ n'ezie ahịa.
I think it is far away.	Echere m na ọ dị anya.
There is no application when together.	Enweghị ngwa mgbe ọnụ.
Afraid and he would want me and he would not.	Na-atụ egwu ma na ọ ga-achọ m na na ọ gaghị achọ.
Well, 'if' go away.	Ọ dị mma, 'ọ bụrụ na' pụọ.
But this humor is not.	Ma ihe ọchị nke a abụghị.
Not everyone is doing it.	Naanị ọ bụghị mmadụ niile na-eme ya.
This is what they do.	Nke a bụ ihe ha na-eme.
It was a difficult time in my life.	Ọ bụ oge siri ike ná ndụ m.
My brother.	Nwanne m nwoke.
But we do not.	Ma anyị anaghị eme ya.
That and his belly.	Nke ahụ na afọ ya.
He stopped what he was thinking.	Ọ kwụsịrị ihe ọ na-eche.
He measured it.	Ọ tụrụ ya.
He had an inner feeling that things were not right.	O nwere mmetụta n'ime na ihe adịghị mma.
But now he has it.	Ma ugbu a o nwere ya.
Thinking, thinking, thinking.	Na-eche, na-eche, na-eche.
First I go.	Na mbụ m na-aga.
It is close but not too far.	Ọ dị nso mana ọ bụghị nke ukwuu.
It is impossible to take seriously.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume iji kpọrọ ihe.
Thank you for your comment.	Daalụ maka ikwu okwu gị.
Of course, it could be more.	N'ezie, ọ nwere ike ịbụ karịa.
I was only told.	A gwara m naanị.
There are more.	E nwere ihe ndị ọzọ.
He will do all things for his sake.	Ọ ga-eme ihe niile ka ọ dị ndụ.
Very likely, he knew himself.	O yikarịrị ka ọ̀ ma ya n'onwe ya.
Not much progress.	Enweghị ọtụtụ ihe ịga n'ihu.
Now he does it.	Ugbu a, o mere ya.
It's more.	Ọ bụ karịa.
Nice to see it.	Ọ dị m mma ịhụ ya.
Then he would have been free.	Mgbe ahụ ọ gaara enwe onwe ya.
Not too scary, just a little scary.	Adịghị egwu nke ukwuu, naanị ntakịrị egwu.
Or something else.	Ma ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
A woman would rather see than be seen.	Nwanyị ga-amasị ịhụ karịa ka a hụ ya.
I think that is where he lives.	Echere m na ọ bụ ebe o bi.
Things may be different.	Ihe nwere ike ịdị iche.
He often thinks about himself.	Ọ na-eche banyere onwe ya ọtụtụ mgbe.
He was amazed at the man's confidence.	Obi ike nwoke ahụ nwere tụrụ ya n’anya.
But they are his children.	Ma ha bụ ụmụ ya.
This is a historical event.	Nke a bụ ihe omume mere eme.
Again, we feel like we are doing this.	Ọzọ, ọ dị anyị ka anyị na-eme nke a.
It is good now.	Ọ dị mma ugbu a.
We are very close.	Anyị dị ezigbo nso.
Your students have the right to dance elsewhere.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ gị nwere ikike ịgba egwu n'ebe ọzọ.
I am not.	Adịghị m.

Humans are very different.	Ụmụ mmadụ dị nnọọ iche.
I don’t think anyone will do it.	Echeghị m na onye ọ bụla ga-eme ya.
Wait, what? 	Chere, gịnị?
he thought in his heart.	o chere n'obi ya.
But he went on.	Ma ọ gara n’ihu.
Each family received a small gift.	Ezinụlọ ọ bụla nwetara obere onyinye.
It is a logical idea.	Ọ bụ echiche ezi uche dị na ya.
With her son.	Ya na nwa ya nwoke.
It will be around this place.	Ọ ga-adị gburugburu ebe a ebe.
If he wants to see me, he knows the way.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ chọrọ ịhụ m, ọ maara ụzọ.
He was doing his job.	Ọ nọ na-arụ ọrụ ya.
It is your job.	Ọ bụ ọrụ gị.
They will not exist.	Ha agaghị adị.
That is the good news.	Nke ahụ bụ ezigbo akụkọ.

You do not know how much.	Ị maghị ole.
That still exists.	Nke ahụ ka dị.
Because you got it.	N'ihi na ị nwetara ya.
My prison is not there.	Ụlọ mkpọrọ m anọghị ebe ahụ.
Great idea.	Nke nnukwu echiche.
This is not your case.	Nke a abụghị ikpe gị.
Things are fine now.	Ihe dị mma ugbu a.
I know him well.	M maara ya nke ọma.
It is their place.	Ọ bụ ebe ha nọ.
With great power comes great work.	Na nnukwu ike na-abịa nnukwu ọrụ.
It is really beautiful.	Ọ mara mma n'ezie.
You have two options now.	Ị nwere ihe abụọ ugbu a.
This is a joke.	Nke a bụ ihe ọchị.
They want to make you happy.	Ha chọrọ ime gị obi ụtọ.
It's great to be.	Ọ dị oke mma ịbụ.
But in practice this happens very little.	Ma na omume nke a na-eme nnọọ obere.
He never looked me in the eye when speaking.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ lere ihu m anya mgbe ọ na-ekwu okwu.
It’s not a good thing or anything.	Ọ bụghị ihe dị mma ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
First off the plane.	Mbụ pụọ ụgbọ elu .
Their marriage is happy.	Di na nwunye ha nwere obi ụtọ.
It is worth a trip to the side.	Ọ bara uru njem n'akụkụ.
He will have a bad week.	Ọ ga-enwe izu ọjọọ.
That doesn't make sense.	Nke ahụ enweghị isi.
We will do whatever we want, and he and everyone else can do it.	Anyị ga-eme ihe ọ bụla anyị chọrọ, ya na onye ọ bụla ọzọ nwere ike ime.
He knows them.	Ọ maara ha.
There is no high performance here.	Enweghị ọrụ dị elu ebe a.
But that is not the law.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị iwu.
He has friends there.	O nwere ndị enyi ebe ahụ.
I am happy with my approach.	Enwere m obi ụtọ na ụzọ m.
You do not know.	Ị maghị.
They have been doing this for many years.	Ha na-eme otú ahụ kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.
There is no light in any house.	Ọkụ adịghị n'ụlọ ọ bụla.
However, life is not a game.	Otú ọ dị, ndụ abụghị egwuregwu.
I believe it.	M kwere ya.
Because they knew it was true.	N'ihi na ha maara na ọ bụ eziokwu.
We talk about the way we go.	Anyị na-ekwu maka ụzọ anyị si aga.
We did not do this.	Anyị emeghị nke a.
I can't do it.	Enweghị m ike ime ya.
But it is better.	Ma ọ ka mma.
If they can help us, they can help us.	Ọ bụrụ na ha ga-enyere anyị aka, ha nwere ike inyere anyị aka.
They made us.	Ha mere anyị.
I do not like that.	Nke ahụ adịghị m mma.
Some father he is.	Ụfọdụ nna ọ bụ.
The living city is at work.	Obodo ahụ dị ndụ na-arụ ọrụ.
But it's the same everywhere.	Ma ọ bụ otu ihe ahụ ebe niile.
That's hot.	Nke ahụ bụ ọkụ.
Being unique is a gift.	Ịbụ ihe pụrụ iche bụ onyinye.
Only men are in this room.	Naanị ụmụ nwoke nọ n'ime ụlọ a.
There are no holidays in a week.	Enweghị ụbọchị ezumike n'ime otu izu.
They will come from another place.	Ha ga-esi ebe ọzọ bịa.
We do not need help.	Anyị achọghị enyemaka.
Everything else should be in place.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ kwesịrị ịdị n'ebe ọ dị.
They said it would not happen.	Ha kwuru na ọ gaghị eme.
Not until the next morning, she started on her own.	Ọ bụghị ruo n'ụtụtụ echi ya, ọ malitere onwe ya.
He can do anything.	O nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla.
I do not know what is there.	Amaghị m ihe dị n'ebe ahụ.
I am happy with them !.	Enwere m obi ụtọ na ha!.
I do not know how he does it.	Amaghị m otú o si eme ya.
I read minutes.	M na-agụ nkeji.
I wonder if it is true.	M na-eche ma ọ bụ eziokwu.
This would not have happened around us.	Nke a agaraghị eme gburugburu anyị.
That was his favorite word.	Nke ahụ bụ okwu kacha amasị ya.
He did this.	O mere otu a.
I stopped in front of them.	M kwụsịrị n'ihu ha.
I want to say it.	Achọrọ m ikwu ya.
In the meantime, let's help these people.	Ka ọ dị ugbu a, ka anyị nyere ndị a aka.
Higher than most.	Dị elu karịa ọtụtụ.
The law of the Most High is law.	Iwu nke onye ka elu nyere bụ iwu.
If the application does not benefit the court.	Ọ bụrụ na ngwa ahụ enweghị uru ụlọ ikpe ikpe.
The river is long.	Osimiri ahụ dị ogologo.
He was heartbroken.	Obi ya juru ya obi.
But that is for today.	Mana nke ahụ bụ maka taa.
Go to work now.	Gaa ọrụ ugbu a.
This is especially true for both models.	Nke a bụ eziokwu maka ụdị abụọ a tụrụ atụ.
He liked me.	O nwere mmasị n'ebe m nọ.
I can see everything.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ihe niile.
I do not know he refused.	Amaghị m na ọ jụrụ.
But this authority is no different from other powers.	Mana ikike a adịghị iche na ikike ndị ọzọ.
I know every deed.	Amaara m omume ọ bụla.
We have some beautiful players.	Anyị nwere ụfọdụ ndị egwuregwu mara mma.
The car is full.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ juru n'ọnụ.
This is very important.	Nke a dị oke mkpa.
Wine is worth it.	Mmanya kwesịrị ya.
They are here for you.	Ha nọ ebe a maka gị.
I need more money.	Achọrọ m ego karịa.
I can say what he thinks.	Enwere m ike ikwu ihe ọ na-eche.
No other man is like that.	Ọ dịghị nwoke ọzọ dị otú ahụ.
So far, nothing special.	Ruo ugbu a, ọ dịghị ihe pụrụ iche.
It is more than that.	Ọ karịrị ya.
They have a great impact.	Ha nwere mmetụta dị ukwuu.
It may be nice to be different.	Ọ nwere ike ịdị mma ịdị iche.
The first step is to relax.	Ihe mbụ ị ga-eme bụ izu ike.
They know you and know how and why.	Ha maara gị ma mara otú na ihe kpatara ya.
But like you, he loves my family.	Ma dị ka gị, ọ hụrụ ezinụlọ m n'anya.
Now, no more.	Ugbu a, ọ dịghị ọzọ.
A man dressed in all police uniforms was sitting next to him.	Otu nwoke nke yi uwe ojii niile nọ ọdụ n'akụkụ ya.
It does me good.	Ọ na-eme m nke ọma.
He will not do anything.	Ọ gaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.
He loves her very much.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya nke ukwuu.
It can go out.	O nwere ike ịpụ.
We are still working on it.	Anyị ka na-arụ ọrụ na ya.
Stop thinking that he will never do anything wrong.	Kwụsị iche na ọ gaghị eme ihe ọjọọ ọ bụla.
I'm here when you need to talk.	Anọ m ebe a mgbe ị chọrọ ikwu okwu.
But the worst is yet to come.	Mana nke kacha njọ ka ga-abịa.
That's not true, 'he said,' very serious. '	Ọ bụghị nke ahụ,' ka o kwuru, dị ezigbo njọ.
There is no useful information in them.	Enweghị ozi bara uru n'ezie n'ime ha.
You can see it as clearly as anything.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ya n'ụzọ doro anya dị ka ihe ọ bụla.
Like wine or anything.	Dị ka mmanya ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla.
This whole city is.	Obodo a niile bụ.
But they made us happy !.	Ma ha mere ka anyị nwee obi ụtọ!.
He never did that.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ mere nke ahụ.
I have a clear idea of ​​my game.	Enwere m echiche doro anya banyere egwuregwu m.
But then there is the lie.	Ma mgbe ahụ, e nwere ụgha.
Still beautiful.	Ka mara mma.
We are one.	Anyị bụ otu.
No one said much.	Ọ dịghị onye kwuru ọtụtụ ihe.
They will do me no harm.	Ha agaghị eme m ihe ọ bụla.
We know that information about our finances is incorrect.	Anyị maara na ozi gbasara ego anyị adịghị mma.
He did not want to do that.	Ọ chọghị ime otú ahụ.
You wonder what might have caused someone to do that.	Ị na-eche ihe nwere ike ime ka mmadụ mee nke ahụ.
Not for a minute.	Ọ bụghị maka otu nkeji.
I hope you enjoy my work.	Enwere m olileanya na ọrụ m ga-amasị gị.
I have a back.	Azụ ya dị m.
He put his bag.	O tinyere akpa ya.
I do not want, we said.	Achọghị m, anyị kwuru.
Like a movie.	Dị ka ihe nkiri.
But this is really a big deal.	Ma nke a bụ n'ezie nnukwu ihe.
He said more than he wanted to.	O kwuru karịa ka ọ chọrọ.
You can never bear this situation again.	Ị nweghị ike ibu ọnọdụ a ọzọ.
It is expensive.	Ọ dị oke ọnụ.
You will not want it.	Ị gaghị achọ ya agụụ.
But of course not.	Ma n'ezie ọ bụghị.
You know about different things.	Ị mara maka ihe dị iche iche.
I know he knows everything about me.	Ama m na ọ ma ihe niile gbasara m.
In the dining room.	Na ụlọ iri nri.
Now it’s every day.	Ugbu a, ọ bụ ụbọchị ọ bụla.
Lack of interest in daily activities.	Enweghị mmasị na ihe omume kwa ụbọchị.
I don’t have that kind of time.	Enweghị m ụdị oge ahụ.
Everyone has information, actions.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ozi, omume.
The boy was terrified.	Nwa nwoke ahụ na-atụ egwu ihe egwu.
You will be fine.	Ị ga-adị mma.
Your father wants you to have this.	Nna gị chọrọ ka ị nweta nke a.
This is not just a matter of gender.	Nke a abụghị naanị okwu gbasara nwoke na nwanyị.
Just tell me what you think.	Naanị gwa m ihe ị chere.
I'm happy to be here.	Obi dị m ụtọ ịnọ ebe a.
Nice to be with you here !.	Ọ dị mma ka gị na gị nọrọ ebe a!.
We have a meeting next week.	Anyị na-enwe nzukọ n'izu na-abịa.
Maybe that’s the difference.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ bụ ihe dị iche.
What you know, call you.	Ihe ị maara, ịkpọ gị.
He is strong and free.	O siri ike ma nwee onwe ya.
That is not the issue.	Nke ahụ abụghị okwu ahụ.
He will come as soon as he can, no matter what.	Ọ ga-abịa ngwa ngwa o nwere ike, n'agbanyeghị ihe ọ bụla.
This is the day.	Nke a bụ ụbọchị.
Nothing interested in me before that.	Ọ dịghị ihe nwere mmasị na m tupu nke ahụ.
Or some sort of disgusting thing.	Ma ọ bụ ụfọdụ ihe juru asị.
That's the whole way.	Ọ bụ nke ahụ n'ụzọ niile.
You are making your day as usual.	Ị na-eme ụbọchị gị ka ọ dị na mbụ.
No one can judge you.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ikpe gị ikpe.
The symbolic situation is here.	Ọnọdụ ihe atụ dị ebe a.
He is still in the lead.	Ọ ka nọ n'isi.
He was obviously nervous.	O doro anya na ụjọ nọ na ya.
We are happy about it.	Anyị nwere obi ụtọ banyere ya.
Which is his authority.	Nke bụ ikike ya.
She started to cry.	Malitere ibe ákwá.
People come to the door.	Ndị mmadụ na-abịa n'ọnụ ụzọ.
Our players do.	Ndị egwuregwu anyị na-eme.
I would be happy if you liked it, he said.	Aga m enwe obi ụtọ ma ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị, o kwuru.
Many machines operate in the city.	Ọtụtụ igwe igwe na-arụ ọrụ n'ime obodo.
The first is simple.	Nke mbụ dị mfe.
We are only talking about the fight.	Naanị ihe anyị na-ekwu bụ banyere ọgụ ahụ.
That is your current situation.	Nke ahụ bụ ọnọdụ gị ugbu a.
The bar style is simple.	Ụlọ mmanya ụdị dị mfe.
Or his head.	Ma ọ bụ isi ya.
He does not like vegetables.	Akwụkwọ nri adịghị amasị ya.
They waited a minute or more.	Ha chere otu nkeji ma ọ bụ karịa.
We read through those.	Anyị na-agụ site na ndị ahụ.
History has proved this to be the case.	Akụkọ ihe mere eme mere ka ọ dị otú ahụ.
Because they should.	N'ihi na ha kwesịrị.
Let me know at the event.	Mee ka m mara na ihe omume ahụ.
You should see the foolish eyes in front of you.	Ị kwesịrị ịhụ anya nzuzu dị n'ihu gị.
My job is to keep my eyes peeled.	Ọrụ m bụ ime ka m ghara ịhụ anya.
He knows it well.	Otú ahụ ka ọ maara ya nke ọma.
This photo is in full swing.	Foto a na-agba agba.
This is beyond me.	Nke a karịrị m ike.
There are things to do.	O nwere ihe ndị e kwesịrị ime.
We have his story.	Anyị nwere akụkọ ya.
But not in a good way.	Ma ọ bụghị n'ụzọ dị mma.
This is not a lie.	Nke a abụghị ụgha.
Maybe running my life.	Ma eleghị anya, na-agba ọsọ ndụ m.
I like it very much.	Enwere m mmasị dị ukwuu.
Of course we would like to help '.	N'ezie anyị ga-amasị inyere'.
Or because nothing happens.	Ma ọ bụ n'ihi na ọ dịghị ihe na-eme.
The first three were terrified.	Ụjọ tụrụ atọ ndị mbụ.
Or maybe they are new.	Ma ọ bụ ma eleghị anya, ha bụ ndị ọhụrụ.
It makes me happy.	Na-eme m obi ụtọ.
Or better yet, for that matter.	Ma ọ bụ ka mma, maka okwu ahụ.
He loved them, but then he had no shoes before the crowd.	Ọ hụrụ ha n'anya, ma mgbe ahụ o nweghị akpụkpọ ụkwụ tupu ndị ahụ.
But only one.	Mana naanị otu.
I know they will never do the same thing.	Ama m na ha agaghị eme otu ihe ahụ mgbe ọ bụla.
Very, very powerful.	Nke ukwuu, dị ike.
Thanks, that's fine with you.	Daalụ, nke ahụ dị gị mma.
Quick and easy !.	Ngwa ngwa na mfe!.
That path really worked.	Ụzọ ahụ gara n'ezie.
You made my day beautiful.	Ị mere ka ụbọchị m mara mma.
Kids are happy to see you.	Obi dị ụmụaka ụtọ ịhụ gị.
A woman always.	Nwanyị nwanyị mgbe niile.
Their race is pointless and hopeless.	Ọsọ ha na-agba enweghị isi na enweghị olileanya.
She has no idea.	O nweghị echiche.
Water is a time of hope.	Mmiri bụ oge olileanya.
But now he is gone.	Ma ugbu a, ọ pụọ.
What life is like for you.	Olee otú ndụ dị na ya.
I am not as stupid as the other.	Abụghị m onye nzuzu dị ka nke ọzọ.

Of course not.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị nke ahụ.
It looked awesome to me.	O lere m anya dị egwu.
I know why.	Amaara m ihe kpatara ya.
There is no doubt about it.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya na ya.
History is important.	Akụkọ ihe mere eme dị mkpa.
He is the most handsome man out there.	Ọ bụ nwoke kacha mara mma n'ebe ahụ.
Twelve girls dance.	Ụmụ agbọghọ iri na abụọ na-agba egwu.
Working from a temporary company.	Na-arụ ọrụ site n'ụlọ ọrụ nwa oge.
I fear water more than fire.	M na-atụ egwu mmiri karịa ọkụ.
The church is good.	Ụka ahụ dị mma.
They are still doing it.	Ha ka na-eme ya.
Maybe we can do something.	Nwere ike anyị nwere ike ime ihe.
Staff could not help more, no problem.	Ndị ọrụ enweghị ike inye aka karịa, ọ nweghị nsogbu.
Still, this is considered important.	N'agbanyeghị nke a, nke a chere na ọ dị mkpa.
But one thing is certain.	Ma otu ihe doro anya.
But of course there are others to come.	Ma n'ezie enwere ndị ọzọ na-abịa.
This is us.	Nke a bụ anyị.
You have to make your own, you know.	Ị ga-eme nke gị, ị maara.
A few years ago though.	Afọ ole na ole gara aga ma.
Here is the information you need.	Nke a bụ ozi ị chọrọ.
That was the best time of my life.	Oge ahụ bụ oge kacha mma ná ndụ m.
That's true.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu.
The idea is beautiful, too.	Echiche a mara mma, kwa.
Just a friend.	Naanị enyi.
No one, just thing.	O nweghị onye, ​​naanị ihe.

We lived close when our family was small.	Anyị bi nso mgbe ezinụlọ anyị dị obere.
But it works.	Ma ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
It started well.	Ọ malitere nke ọma.
It will not be for principal instruction.	Ọ gaghị abụ maka nkuzi onye isi.
The time will come here soon.	Oge a ga-abịa ebe a n'oge adịghị anya.
First, you will need 30 beds.	Mbụ, ị ga-achọ akwa iri atọ.
Of course it is.	O doro anya na ọ bụ.
He immediately went and waited for her.	Ọ gara ozugbo chere ya.
He stopped at the dictatorship.	Ọ kwụsịrị n'ebe aka aka ike.
It comes in bags.	Ọ na-abịa na akpa.
The idea of ​​continuity comes from somewhere.	Echiche na-aga n'ihu na-abịa site na ebe.
He was amazed there.	O juru ya anya n’ebe ahụ.
But no more.	Ma ọ dịghị ọzọ.
Anyone can say those words at that time.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ike ikwu okwu ndị ahụ n'oge ahụ.
The temperature in the house is very high.	Okpomọkụ dị n'ụlọ ahụ dị elu nke ukwuu.
This happens over and over again.	Nke a na-eme ugboro ugboro.
A few more questions though.	Ajụjụ ole na ole ọzọ n'agbanyeghị.
He knew that he did not understand anything.	Ọ maara na ọ dịghị ihe ya aghọtaghị.
Nothing like it.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị ka ọ dị.
Can you stay here for a minute?	Ị nwere ike ịnọ ebe a otu nkeji?
But no more of that from now on.	Ma ọ dịghị ọzọ nke ahụ site ugbu a gaa n'ihu.
Somehow he seems to be familiar with it.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ ọ dị ka ọ maara nke ọma.
I read the newspaper every day.	M na-agụ akwụkwọ akụkọ kwa ụbọchị.
But to no avail.	Ma, ọ dịghị uru.
For some reason.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ.

We look forward to seeing you again soon !.	Anyị na-atụ anya ịhụ gị ọzọ n'oge adịghị anya!.
This is just game money.	Nke a bụ naanị ego egwuregwu.
It's just a question.	Ọ bụ naanị ajụjụ.

Some are better than others.	Ụfọdụ dị mma karịa ndị ọzọ.
There is no money to do the things we did.	Enweghị ego iji mee ihe ndị anyị mere.
That year, we got into it.	N'afọ ahụ, anyị banyere n'ime ya.

It would be nice to have a good one.	Ọ ga-adị mma ka ọ dị mma.

Neither the court nor any group recommends being different.	Ma ụlọ ikpe ma ọ bụ otu ọ bụla adịghị atụ aro ka ọ dị iche.
You can spend the night in the lounge.	Ị nwere ike nọrọ abalị n'ime ụlọ ezumike.

All you have to do is find them this time.	Ihe ị ga-eme bụ ịchọta ha oge a.
I'm sorry it's not the best information for you.	Ọ dị m nwute na ọ bụghị ozi ka mma maka gị.
Probably not.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị.
It does not taste good.	Ọ naghị adị mma.
But now, for your event.	Ma ugbu a, maka ihe omume gị.
Maybe, but.	Nwere ike, mana.
Of course, there was only so much in the second quarter.	N'ezie, e nwere naanị ihe dị na nkeji nke abụọ ahụ.

Those who know them think.	Ndị maara ha na-eche.
However, we think the latter is the case.	Otú ọ dị, anyị na-eche na nke ikpeazụ bụ ikpe.
Status mode does not work.	Ọnọdụ ọnọdụ anaghị arụ ọrụ.
My sister is a beautiful girl who has no boyfriend.	Nwanne m nwanyị bụ nwa agbọghọ mara mma nke na-enweghị enyi nwoke.
My sister wants me.	Nwanne m nwanyị chọrọ m.
It is more than that.	Ọ karịrị ya.
Makes it easy.	Na-eme ka ọ dị mfe.
And hopefully.	Na olileanya.
Give yourself a break.	Nye onwe gị ezumike.
His wife wanted to live.	Nwunye ya chọrọ ịdị ndụ.
That is the law.	Nke ahụ bụ iwu.
It's easy.	Ọ dị mfe.
Simple and efficient.	Dị mfe ma na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
My father was one of them, you see.	Nna m bụ otu n'ime ha, ị hụrụ.
I want to see myself.	Achọrọ m ịhụ onwe m.
But only temporarily.	Ma ọ bụ naanị nwa oge.
He really liked this recipe.	Nri esi nri a masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
But no one wants to.	Ma ọ dịghị onye chọrọ.
He is a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo nwoke.
I try not to think like that.	M na-agbalị ka m ghara iche echiche otú ahụ.
Not disease, but low energy.	Ọ bụghị ọrịa, mana ike dị ala.
This will happen.	Nke a ga-eme.
The weather is beautiful.	Ihu igwe mara mma.
I was in a pretty bad place.	Anọ m na ebe ọjọọ mara mma.
My mother will not die today.	Nne m agaghị anwụ taa.
There is only time for dinner by the water.	Enwere naanị oge maka nri abalị n'akụkụ mmiri.
I did not know why at first.	Amaghị m ihe kpatara ya na mbụ.

He died there.	Ọ nwụrụ n'ebe ahụ.
But we can.	Ma anyị nwere ike.
Eat with them.	Na-eri nri na ha.
His sister was right.	Nwanne ya nwanyị kwuru eziokwu.
But think something else? 	Ma chere ihe ọzọ?
Despite the seriousness of the problem, many people do not like homework.	N'agbanyeghị na ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ dị mkpa, ọrụ ụlọ anaghị amasị ọtụtụ ndị.
It does not taste very good.	Ọ naghị adị mma nke ukwuu.
Together, of course, we can achieve more.	Anyị ọnụ, n'ezie, anyị nwere ike nweta ihe ọzọ.
They bought the house for a song.	Ha zụtara ụlọ ahụ maka abụ.
There is no day.	Ọ nweghị ụbọchị.
There are two children.	Enwere ụmụaka abụọ.
A young girl was shot dead.	A gbara otu nwa agbọghọ ọkụ ọkụ.
A place to call home.	Ebe ịkpọ ụlọ.

Drink plenty of water every day.	Na-aṅụ ọtụtụ mmiri kwa ụbọchị.

This made you get what you wanted.	Nke a mere ka ị nweta ihe ị chọrọ.
Not in this room, at this time, here.	Ọ bụghị n'ime ụlọ a, n'oge a, n'ebe a.
But that is not what the law authorizes.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị ihe iwu nyere ikike.
He looked at the other one.	O lere onye nke ọzọ anya.
It happened so fast.	O mere ngwa ngwa.
Please give me some time.	Biko nye m ntakịrị oge.
Otherwise, you will not see the opportunity.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ị gaghị ahụ ohere.
He took it to heart.	Ọ kpọrọ ya n’obi.
No one died from illness.	Ọ dịghị onye ọrịa nwụrụ n'ihi ọrịa.
In fact, he put it into it.	N'ezie, o tinyere ya n'ime ya.
You are at a limit.	Ị nọ na oke.
Just talk to your friend.	Naanị gwa enyi gị okwu.
That it requires little work.	Na ọ chọrọ obere ọrụ.
Not logical.	Ọ bụghị ezi uche.
We gave birth to one of three hospitals.	Anyị mụrụ otu atọ ụlọ ọgwụ.
But why?	Ma gịnị kpatara ha.
You tell us what to do.	Ị gwara anyị ihe anyị ga-eme.

It is difficult in three ways.	O siri ike n'ụzọ atọ.
This is really simple.	Nke a dị mfe n'ezie.
You know where he is.	Ị ma ebe ọ nọ.

As a couple there.	Dị ka di na nwunye nọ n'ebe ahụ.
Her mother said she was beautiful.	Nne ya kwuru na ọ bụ onye mara mma.
This was not the case a few years ago.	Nke a abụghị ikpe afọ ole na ole gara aga.
However, it is cold.	Otú ọ dị, oyi na-atụ.
To him, this was not good news.	Nye ya, nke a abụghị ozi ọma.
Maybe that's what worries him.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ bụ ihe na-agba ya n'obi.
There was no breakfast then.	Enweghị nri ụtụtụ mgbe ahụ.
They did it.	Ha mere ya.
The boy's mother became angry.	Nne nwata ahụ were iwe were ya.
This will be necessary.	Nke a ga-adị mkpa.

Everything is for you.	Ihe niile bụ n'ihi gị.
He could have seen them again.	Ọ gaara ahụ ha ọzọ.
So you are my son.	Ya mere ị bụ nwa m nwoke.
It had no effect on the game.	O nweghị mmetụta ọ bụla na egwuregwu ahụ.
It's good for me.	Ọ dị mma n'aka m.
Something is wrong.	Ihe na-adịghị mma.
They will not be fast.	Ha agaghị adị ngwa ngwa.
That was the first surprise.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe mbụ tụrụ ya n’anya.
We will never be.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị ga-abụ.
My sister only eats meat all the time.	Nwanne m nwanyị na-eri naanị nri anụ ahụ mgbe niile.

They love each one of us very much.	Ha hụrụ onye ọ bụla n'ime anyị n'anya nke ukwuu.
I told you that afternoon.	Agwara m gị n'ehihie ahụ.
He could not see anything.	Ọ nweghị ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla.
I want to give that to others.	Achọrọ m inye ndị ọzọ nke ahụ.
He did not know what they were.	Ọ maghị ihe ha bụ.
Again, we are all human.	Ọzọ, anyị niile bụ mmadụ.
They all say the same thing.	Ha niile na-ekwu otu ihe.
All three of us.	Anyị niile atọ.
His family, one.	Ezinụlọ ya, otu.

Most friendly.	Nke kacha eme enyi na enyi.
If that’s true, that’s fine.	Ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ bụ eziokwu, ọ dị mma.
He needs it hard this afternoon.	Ọ chọrọ ya ike n'ehihie a.
We did it only twice.	Anyị mere ya naanị abụọ.
The final act of the game.	Omume ikpeazụ nke egwuregwu ahụ.
But there is no reason to blame.	Ma o nweghị ihe a ga-eji taa ya ụta.
Eat them when they are young, strong, and fresh.	Rie ha mgbe ha dị obere, ndị siri ike, na nke ọhụrụ.
This is a message of cruelty.	Nke a bụ ozi nke obi ọjọọ.
I wondered what they would be like.	M nọ na-eche otú ha ga-adị.
It is bad news.	Ọ bụ akụkọ na-adịghị mma.
But other things too.	Ma ihe ndị ọzọ kwa.
We have help.	Anyị nwere enyemaka.
Of course, most of us like to have less.	N'ezie, ọtụtụ n'ime anyị na-achọ inwe obere.

I think he needs help.	Echere m na ọ dị mkpa ka ọ nweta enyemaka.
Fresh wood is no longer used.	A naghị eji osisi ọhụrụ eme ihe karịa.
She tried to stop herself from crying.	Ọ gbalịrị ime onwe ya ka ọ kwụsị ibe ákwá.
They asked questions about the best way to get to the city.	Ha jụrụ ajụjụ maka ụzọ kacha mma isi aga obodo.
Money is hard.	Ego siri ike.
We can see the lights of the city from here.	Anyị nwere ike ịhụ ọkụ nke obodo si ebe a.
She and her boyfriend waited in her room.	Ya na enyi ya nwoke chere n'ime ụlọ ya.
Otherwise, it will be easy.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ọ ga-adị mfe.
However, at higher temperatures, we do not have this problem.	Otú ọ dị, na okpomọkụ dị elu, anyị anaghị enwe nsogbu a.
You know, important things like that.	Ị mara, ihe ndị dị mkpa dị ka nke ahụ.
For that, and for the man.	Maka nke ahụ, na maka nwoke ahụ.
Of course it is harder than that.	N'ezie ọ siri ike karịa nke ahụ.
Of course you can have a night.	N'ezie ị nwere ike inwe abalị.
To access the phone regularly.	Iji nweta ekwentị mgbe niile.
All they want is for us to stop them.	Naanị ihe ha chọrọ bụ ka anyị kwụsị ha.

He expressed his opinion.	O kwuru uche ya.
You know that girl is very pretty.	Ị mara na nwa agbọghọ ahụ mara ezigbo mma.
That is what makes them successful.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe na-eme ka ha nwee ihe ịga nke ọma.
I'm not happy about that anyway.	Obi adịghị m ụtọ na nke ahụ n'agbanyeghị.
This is where he lives.	Nke a bụ ebe o bi.

Then a few more times.	Mgbe ahụ ugboro ole na ole ọzọ.

Or really, the question.	Ma ọ bụ n'ezie, ajụjụ.
They come home, period.	Ha na-abịa n'ụlọ, oge.

And his own dog.	Na nkịta nke ya.
Since he has no fish.	Ebe ọ bụ na o nweghị azụ.
No one is wanted.	Achọghị onye ọ bụla.

They all helped with the final version.	Ha niile nyere aka na ụdị ikpeazụ.
But tonight, you are not working.	Mana n'abalị a, ị naghị arụ ọrụ.

There are a number of reasons.	E nwere ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
I think he should do that a little bit.	Echere m na ọ kwesịrị ime nke ahụ ntakịrị.
He did not know that others were present	Ọ maghị na ndị ọzọ nọ
But he knew he would go.	Ma ọ maara na ọ ga-aga.
I did not understand that then.	Aghọtaghị m nke ahụ mgbe ahụ.
We are confident that he will succeed in this.	Anyị nwere obi ike na ọ ga-aga nke ọma na nke a.
It doesn't seem like much to me.	O yighị m nnukwu ihe ọ bụla.

Everything is going well.	Ihe niile na-aga nke ọma.

He thought it was him, but he knew it wasn’t.	Ọ tụrụ anya na ọ bụ ya, ma ọ maara na ọ bụghị.
If you do that beautifully.	Ọ bụrụ na ị mere nke ahụ mara mma.

It was cold.	Ọ tụrụ oyi.
Since then, he has been looking for a job.	Kemgbe ahụ, ọ na-achọ ọrụ.
I was shocked by what they said.	Ihe ha kwuru juru m obi.
I have no value.	Enweghị m uru ọ bụla.
You just want to be yourself.	Naanị ịchọrọ ịbụ onwe gị.

You will have a life span of almost twenty years.	Ị ga-enwe ndụ ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ afọ iri abụọ.

It looks like he won't let it.	Ọ dị ka ọ gaghị ekwe ka ọ dị.

None of that happened.	Ọ dịghị nke mere.

They will come here to help.	Ha ga-abịa ebe a iji nyere aka.
You know, do it alone.	Ị mara, mee ya naanị.
Water is needed.	Ọ bụ mmiri ka ọ dị mkpa.
Another difference is money.	Ihe ọzọ dị iche bụ ego.
That is what we must do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị ga-eme.
This is a great help.	Nke a bụ nnukwu enyemaka.
Maybe someone skipped some meals.	Ma eleghị anya, mmadụ hapụrụ ụfọdụ nri.

His condition is minor.	Ọnọdụ ya dị ntakịrị.
Why is it hot?	Gịnị mere o ji dị ọkụ?
Stories about yourself.	Akụkọ banyere onwe gị.

Just the feeling of fear and running.	Naanị mmetụta nke egwu na ịgba ọsọ.

But he wanted to talk about it.	Ma ọ chọrọ ikwu banyere ya.
So far he has four.	Ruo ugbu a oge o nwere anọ.

Nothing seems to be important.	Ọ dịghị ihe yiri ka ọ dị mkpa.

This does not work.	Nke a anaghị arụ ọrụ.
You know the first minute is important.	Ị maara na nkeji mbụ dị mkpa.
And the third time.	Na nke ugboro atọ.
A girl can have a tremendous impact.	Nwa agbọghọ nwere ike inwe mmetụta dị egwu.
He tried again and again.	Ọ gbalịrị ugboro ugboro.
You told me the car was coming soon.	Ị gwara m na ụgbọ ala na-abịa n'oge adịghị anya.

I need one first.	Achọrọ m nke mbụ.
But no one was there.	Mana o nweghị onye ebe ahụ.
He is a man.	Ọ bụ nwoke.

He wanted to tell the truth.	Ọ chọrọ ikwu eziokwu.
One that works well is the other hand.	Otu na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma bụ iji aka nke ọzọ.
It was a great success.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ihe ịga nke ọma.
But it's good.	Mana ọ dị mma.
But this is my problem.	Mana nke a bụ nsogbu m.
He did not know what to do.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ ga-eme.
That is far away.	Nke ahụ dị anya.
A little bit goes a long way.	Obere ntakịrị na-aga ogologo ụzọ.
No one knows where he went.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ebe ọ gara.
I want to be confident.	Achọrọ m inwe obi ike.
Still far from its old.	Ka dị anya site na ochie ya.
He refuses to speak to them.	Ọ jụrụ ịgwa ha okwu.
He left me a gift.	Ọ hapụrụ m onyinye.
There, in front, is the house where they first met.	N'ebe ahụ, n'ihu, bụ ụlọ ebe ha zutere na mbụ.
It just so happened.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ihe merenụ.

And a little for myself too.	Na ntakịrị maka onwe m kwa.
Everything he does is so.	Ihe ọ bụla o mere bụ otú ahụ.

It is far ahead of what everyone else is doing.	Ọ dị nnọọ n'ihu ihe onye ọ bụla ọzọ na-eme.
I say why not.	M na-ekwu ihe kpatara na ọ bụghị.
So we have a way out of that skeptical situation.	Ya mere, anyị nwere ụzọ isi pụọ na ọnọdụ obi abụọ ahụ.

There is no way to get it all.	O nweghị ụzọ ị ga-esi nweta ya niile.

Not a big deal.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu ihe.
He gave his life for medicine.	O were ndụ ya nye ọgwụ.
Thank you.	Daalụ.
In this, he has one last word.	Na nke a, o nwere okwu ikpeazụ.

It’s not logical, you might think.	Ọ bụghị ezi uche, ị nwere ike iche.
But water is still at the core of their work.	Mana mmiri ka dị n'isi ọrụ ha.
But that’s not the point of this weekend.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị isi nke izu ụka a.

He wondered what he should do.	Ọ nọ na-eche ihe ọ ga-eme.
To help everyone, the project was a success.	Iji nyere onye ọ bụla aka, ọrụ ahụ gara nke ọma.
You can do the same here.	Ị nwere ike ime otu ihe ahụ ebe a.
Disease-free disease.	Ọrịa na-enweghị ọrịa.
That is what he wants us to do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ chọrọ ka anyị mee.
But he was a good man.	Mana ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.

Ongoing fire made it to the right.	Ọkụ na-aga n'ihu mere ya n'aka nri.
But you have no other important choice.	Ma ị nweghị ihe ọzọ dị mkpa ị ga-eme.
I feel better now.	Enwere m ahụ nke ọma ugbu a.

And the stubbornness of telling the truth.	Na isi ike nke ikwu eziokwu.

If he has a hand, he will not look for you.	Ọ bụrụ na o nwere aka, ọ gaghị achọ gị.
Of course he did.	N'ezie ọ chọrọ ya.
That was clear to me.	Nke ahụ doro m anya.

A friend is there.	Otu enyi ya nọ ebe ahụ.

Of course, there are many.	N'ezie, e nwere ọtụtụ n'ime ha.
All the fish died.	Azụ niile nwụrụ.
It's like that in team games, too.	Ọ dị ka nke ahụ na egwuregwu otu, kwa.
These words are important.	Okwu ndị a dị mkpa.

The school year will be tough again.	Afọ akwụkwọ ga-esi ike ọzọ.

There is no strong feeling.	Enweghị mmetụta siri ike.

This is a good thing to do, he told himself.	Nke a bụ ihe dị mma ime, ọ gwara onwe ya.
More sleep.	Ọtụtụ ụra ọzọ.

Most users will use one language or another.	Ọtụtụ ndị ọrụ ga-eji otu asụsụ ma ọ bụ nke ọzọ.
That kind of work.	Nke ahụ bụ ụdị ọrụ ahụ.

Many parents expect their children to do well in school.	Ọtụtụ ndị nne na nna na-atụ anya ka ụmụ ha na-eme nke ọma n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
No one believed him.	Ọ dịghị onye kwere ya.
The story is two-person fights.	Akụkọ ahụ bụ mmadụ abụọ na ọgụ.

We shot it in many different ways, too.	Anyị gbara ya ọtụtụ ụzọ dị iche iche, kwa.

You can talk to the girl.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa nwa agbọghọ ahụ okwu.

Stop being reasonable.	Kwụsị inwe ezi uche.

It may take about a day or two.	Ọ nwere ike were ihe dị ka otu ụbọchị ma ọ bụ abụọ.

For the other, it may not be.	Maka nke ọzọ, ọ nwere ike ọ gaghị adị.
That is not what we want.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe anyị chọrọ.

What is clear is that this plant is huge.	Ihe doro anya bụ na osisi a dị oke.
John stopped then.	John kwụsịrị mgbe ahụ.
It does a great job here.	Ọ na-arụ nnukwu ọrụ ebe a.
My new helper is very angry.	Onye enyemaka ọhụrụ m nwere oke iwe.

But wait, there is something else.	Mana chere, enwere ihe ọzọ.
We do not know how bad it will be.	Anyị amaghị otú ọ ga-esi dị njọ.
And that's the thing.	Na nke ahụ bụ ihe.
That may or may not happen.	Nke ahụ nwere ike ime ma ọ bụ ghara ime.
You know what you need.	Ị maara ihe ị chọrọ ya.
His heart was still running.	Obi ya ka na-agba ọsọ.
That’s fine, but not that special.	Nke dị mma, ma ọ bụghị nke ahụ pụrụ iche.
It's better that way.	Ọ ka mma otu ahụ.
Now I don't like it, I don't like it.	Ugbu a ọ gaghị amasị m, enweghị mmasị.
Until you do anything.	Ruo mgbe ị na-eme ihe ọ bụla.
That's what kids do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ụmụaka na-eme.
Only that it should be a clear truth.	Naanị na ọ kwesịrị ịbụ eziokwu doro anya.
I do not know how they do it.	Amaghị m ka ha si eme ya.
It's like one.	Ọ dị ka otu.
I was happy again.	Enwere m obi ụtọ ọzọ.
He did not know that what he was doing was wrong.	Ọ maghị na ihe ọ na-eme adịghị mma.
We need people like you.	Anyị ga-achọ ndị dị ka gị.
I'm still hungry.	Ọ ka na-agụ m agụụ.

It's like cooking meat.	Ọ dị ka isi nri anụ.
But I like it so much, it's a special story.	Mana ọ masịrị m nke ukwuu, ọ bụ akụkọ pụrụ iche.
It's not morning.	Ọ bụghị onye ụtụtụ.
It could be a week.	Ọ nwere ike ịbụ izu.
They may not like it but they cannot help it.	Ha nwere ike ọ gaghị amasị ya mana ha enweghị ike inyere ya aka.
Price is one person.	Ọnụ ahịa bụ otu onye.
Now this is an event that should be like.	Ugbu a nke a bụ ihe omume kwesịrị ịdị ka.
I was working there.	Anọ m na-arụ ọrụ ebe ahụ.
Then it stopped for a while.	Mgbe ahụ ọ kwụsịrị ruo nwa oge.
This situation cannot continue.	Ọnọdụ a enweghị ike ịga n'ihu.
We heard about it with the police.	Anyị nụrụ banyere ya na ndị uwe ojii.
I love you so.	A hụrụ m gị n'anya otu a.
Give yourself a break and spend some time with your family.	Nye onwe gị ezumike ma nọrọ oge ụfọdụ na ezinụlọ gị.
It is still small.	Ọ ka dị obere.
It was his biggest opportunity.	Ọ bụ nnukwu ohere ya.
One that should see.	Otu nke kwesịrị ịhụ.
He took his lunch.	O were nkeji iri nri ya.
They can only take them for words.	Ha nwere ike were ha naanị n'ọnụ okwu.
The city has a history of violence.	Obodo nwere akụkọ ime ihe ike.
They should have.	Ha kwesịrị inwe.
I do not love him.	Ahụghị m ya n'anya.
He was happy anywhere on the beach.	Ọ na-enwe obi ụtọ n'ebe ọ bụla n'akụkụ osimiri.
But there is no hurry, take your time.	Mana ọ nweghị ọsọ ọsọ, were oge gị.
I do not want to do.	Achọghị m ime.
Why, happened.	Gịnị mere, mere.
The idea is a little scary.	Echiche ahụ dị ntakịrị egwu.
He was drinking.	Ọ na-aṅụ mmanya.
Everything else is beautiful.	Ihe ndị ọzọ niile mara mma.
The coffee table fills the room.	Isi kọfị juru ụlọ ahụ.
He did not know that it was us.	Ọ maghị na ọ bụ anyị.
Around it, it is not close.	Gburugburu ya, ọ bụghị nso.
This is what they do not tell you.	Nke a bụ ihe ha anaghị agwa gị.
There are three special schools.	Enwere ụlọ akwụkwọ pụrụ iche atọ.
We had a great time.	Anyị nwere ezigbo oge.
Will there be rain?	Mmiri ga-abịa?
Once you get used to it, however, it works fine.	Otú ọ dị, ozugbo ị mara ya ahụ́, ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
He did not know.	Ọ maghị.
This case is much more serious.	Okwu ikpe a siri ike karịa.
The idea behind this project is fantastic.	Echiche dị n'azụ ọrụ a dị egwu.
At first, they thought it was easy.	Nke mbụ, ha chere na ihe ọchị dị mfe.

We should not bear the patient in any way.	Anyị ekwesịghị ibu onye ọrịa ahụ n’ụzọ ọ bụla.
He’s in the store, but it doesn’t work.	Ọ nọ n'ụlọ ahịa, mana ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
It is very clear.	O doro anya nke ukwuu.
No problem.	Enweghị nsogbu ọ bụla.
They are fast, tough and all about the situation today.	Ha dị ngwa ngwa, nke siri ike na ihe niile gbasara ọnọdụ nke taa.
More than one person.	Ọ karịrị otu onye.
Basically, he was told over and over again, he would do nothing.	N'ụzọ bụ isi, a gwara ya ugboro ugboro, ọ gaghị eme ihe ọ bụla.
The places he went to were special.	Ebe ndị ọ gara pụrụ iche.
They are in trouble.	Ha nọ ná nsogbu.
It took three days.	O were ụbọchị atọ.
I will be here alone.	Naanị m ga-anọ ebe a.

Nothing seems to matter.	Ọ dịghị ihe yiri ka ọ dị mkpa.

It does not seem to be useful.	O yighị ka ọ bara uru.
We do not want to go.	Achọghị ka anyị gaa.
But she could not do anything about it.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ pụrụ ime banyere ya.
Suddenly, he stopped and ordered me to move on.	Na mberede, ọ kwụsịrị ma nye m iwu ka m gaa n'ihu.
It's like my stomach.	Ọ dị ka afọ m.

However, it does not matter.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mkpa.
I hope they are well and happy.	Enwere m olileanya na ha dị mma ma nwee obi ụtọ.

This is the fourth week.	Nke a bụ izu nke anọ.

They gave me two things.	Ha nyere m ihe abụọ.
People really want this.	Ndị mmadụ chọrọ nke a n'ezie.
No one knows what tomorrow will bring, anytime.	Ọ dịghị onye ma ihe ga-eme echi, mgbe ọ bụla.
No thanks.	Mba daalụ.
It was a great trip.	Ọ bụ nnukwu njem.
A little bit by one power.	Obere obere site na otu ike.
It finally reached me.	O mechara ruo m.
We cherished that work.	Anyị ji ọrụ ahụ kpọrọ ihe.
That is not true.	Nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
The best of the two of us is far away.	Nke kacha mma n'ime anyị abụọ dị anya.
What’s worse is that he doesn’t know, of course, what he’s doing.	Ihe kacha njọ bụ na ọ maghị, n'ezie, ihe ọ na-eme.
Can't find anyone to do that.	Enweghị ike ịhụ onye ga-eme nke ahụ.
I want to be reasonable with you.	Achọrọ m ka mụ na gị nwee ezi uche.
I will be the man.	M ga-abụ nwoke ahụ.
But he doesn’t just know the company.	Mana ọ maghị naanị ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
Only books, books, books and photos.	Naanị akwụkwọ, akwụkwọ, akwụkwọ na foto.

The chief looked out the window.	Onye isi ahụ lere anya na windo.
Kind of awesome.	Ụdị dị egwu.
This is my ongoing work.	Nke a bụ ọrụ m na-aga n'ihu.
It seems like a lot of people miss the obvious.	Ọ dị ka ọtụtụ ndị na-atụ uche nke doro anya.
His work is beautiful.	Ọrụ ya mara mma.
But the value of such studies is clear.	Ma, ọmụmụ ihe ha bara uru doro anya.
I want to know what is happening here.	Achọrọ m ịma ihe na-eme ebe a.
Things will be different.	Ihe ga-adị iche.
This is the time to be proud and temporary.	Nke a bụ oge ị ga-eji anya isi na nwa oge.
Nothing will please anyone.	Ọ dịghị ihe ga-amasị onye ọ bụla.
You have it.	Ị nwere ya.
I know that is why.	Ama m na ọ bụ ya kpatara ya.
That is your problem, not mine.	Nke ahụ bụ nsogbu gị, ọ bụghị nke m.
Sorry but the truth.	Ọ dị nwute mana eziokwu.

One of them died when he was 12 years old.	Otu n’ime ha nwụrụ mgbe ọ dị afọ iri na abụọ.
Still, it is good.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ dị mma.
You have no choice but to run.	O nweghị ihe ị ga-eme ma ọ́ bụghị ịgba ọsọ.
That did not happen often.	Nke ahụ emeghị ọtụtụ mgbe.

But money is still there.	Ma ego ka dị n'ebe ahụ.
Can you eat?	Ị nwere ike iri nri?
This happens a lot.	Nke a na-eme ọtụtụ mgbe.
This situation comes around.	Ọnọdụ a na-abịa gburugburu.

I was at the headquarters from ten to eleven.	Anọ m n'isi ụlọ ọrụ site na iri ruo iri na otu.
I care about you.	Enwere m mmetụta ebe ị nọ.
Too big.	Oke ibu.
Each theme is the same.	Isi okwu ọ bụla bụ otu.
The child is weak, but alive.	Nwa ahụ adịghị ike, mana ọ dị ndụ.
The land produces cheap food.	Ala na-eme nri dị ọnụ ala.
You will not have any problems.	Ị gaghị enwe nsogbu.
It was time to leave.	O rutere n'oge ka ọ pụọ.
That is the bigger story for next season.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ka ukwuu maka oge ọzọ.
They, meanwhile, have no body.	Ha, ka ọ dị ugbu a, enweghị ahụ.
Two things can happen from here.	Ihe abụọ nwere ike ime site na ebe a.
I want to know why.	Achọrọ m ịma ihe kpatara ya.
The factory is full of fish.	Isi azụ̀ juru n’ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
People are unemployed.	Ndị mmadụ enweghị ọrụ.

She immediately felt very weak.	Ọ bịara dị ya ozugbo ahụ adịghị ike.
This went on for a long time.	Nke a gara n'ihu ruo ogologo oge.
I want to be in this song.	Achọrọ m ịnọ n'otu egwu a.
I have a disease of this challenge.	Enwere m ọrịa nke ịma aka a.
See one of these guys recently.	Hụrụ otu n'ime ndị a na-arụ ọrụ na nso nso a.
Here the road can go together more than once.	Ebe a ụzọ nwere ike ịga na ọnụ ihe karịrị otu ugboro.
For others, it would be better.	N'ebe ndị ọzọ nọ, ọ ga-adị mma.
What can he find inside?	Gịnị ka ọ pụrụ ịhụ n'ime ya?
Sometimes, no.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, mba.
It is easy to imagine how it came to be in this.	Ọ dị mfe iche ka o si bịa na nke a.
All of that is funny.	Ihe niile ahụ na-atọ ọchị.
But it's not really that hard.	Ma ọ bụghị n'ezie siri ike otú ahụ.
Few have it.	Ole na ole nwere ya.
He has one now.	O nwere otu ugbu a.
Obviously, they have no time.	N'ụzọ doro anya, ha enweghị oge.
I know it exists.	Ama m na ọ dị.
However, it is self-interest.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụ mmasị onwe onye.
However, it is actually the parents situation.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụ n'ezie ndị nne na nna na ọnọdụ.
There is no such thing.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị otú ahụ.
Just stay here, now.	Naanị nọrọ ebe a, ugbu a.
However, that is not the point.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ abụghị isi ihe.
Everyone goes on their own.	Onye ọ bụla na-aga n'ihu nke ya.
We only say what we know.	Anyị na-ekwu naanị ihe anyị maara.
So I have two jobs.	Ya mere enwere m ọrụ abụọ.

Of course not.	N'ezie, ị bụghị.

They made it very strong.	Ha siri ya ike nke ukwuu.
I made good use of that name.	Eji m aha ahụ mee nke ọma.
He will not tell me anything.	Ọ gaghị agwa m ihe ọ bụla.
He was amazed.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.
As you do.	Dị ka ị na-eme.
Many people live near here.	Ọtụtụ mmadụ bi nso ebe a.
This is something he will do on his own.	Nke a bụ ihe ọ ga-eme n'onwe ya.
My interest in him is different.	Mmasị m nwere n'ebe ọ nọ dị iche.
We can not have that.	Anyị enweghị ike inwe nke ahụ.
Both old and new will be here.	Ma ochie na nke ọhụrụ ga-adị ebe a.
None of them would have died.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ha gaara anwụ.
Maybe he was right.	Ma eleghị anya, o kwuru eziokwu.
Now they can.	Ugbu a, ha nwere ike.
Things make for a great vacation.	Ihe na-eme nke ọma ezumike.
You need someone you like.	Ị chọrọ onye masịrị gị.
There are many office applications out there.	Enwere ọtụtụ ngwa ụlọ ọrụ n'ebe ahụ.
They will be better off here now.	Ha ga-anọ ebe a pụọ ​​nke ọma ugbu a.

Not to mention, it's fun to play.	Ọ bụghị ikwu okwu, ọ na-atọ ụtọ igwu egwu.
And his wife.	Na nwunye ya.
Tell your child how happy you are to have it.	Gwa nwa gị ka obi dị gị ụtọ inwe ya.
Tears welled up in his eyes.	Otu anya mmiri gbara ya n'ihu.
All three are not mutually exclusive.	Ihe atọ niile ekwesịghị ịma ibe ha.
For some reason beauty refused to act.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ mma jụrụ ime ihe.
It will continue when you leave.	Ọ ga-aga n'ihu ma ị pụọ.
Would you like it differently?	Ọ ga-amasị ya n'ụzọ dị iche?
But no one.	Ma ọ dịghị onye.
But, boy, is it scary.	Ma, nwa nwoke, ọ nwere egwu.
No one comes through the door.	Ọ dịghị onye na-abịa n'ọnụ ụzọ.
Most people do not see that.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ anaghị ahụ nke ahụ.
It may be here.	O nwere ike ịnọ ebe a.
The house is on fire.	Ụlọ ahụ na-agba ọkụ.
I like that type.	Ụdị ahụ na-amasị m.
But he knew it had happened.	Ma ọ maara na o mere.
None of these things are by accident.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a bụ na mberede.
None of it he wanted.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ chọrọ.
There they told us many things.	N'ebe ahụ, ha gwara anyị banyere ọtụtụ okwu.
I saw it.	Ahụrụ m ya.
It can not be.	O nweghị ike ịbụ.
Family is everything.	Ezinụlọ bụ ihe niile.

A song of war.	Abụ ọgụ.
I'm sure he has other plans for me.	Eji m n'aka na o nwere atụmatụ ndị ọzọ maka m.
He did not always eat.	Ọ naghị eri nri mgbe niile.
Sometimes they asked him out immediately.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ha jụrụ ya ozugbo.
Our little house.	Obere ụlọ anyị.
If the cause is important, they will be very different.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mkpa ihe kpatara ya, ha ga-adị nnọọ iche.
The prison was small and insignificant.	Ụlọ mkpọrọ ahụ dị obere na enweghị isi.
We are not alone.	Ọ bụghị naanị anyị.
However, there are useful applications.	Otú ọ dị, enwere ngwa bara uru.
Others are on the way.	Ndị ọzọ nọ n'ụzọ.
That’s what his family is for.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ezinụlọ ya bụ maka.
Then the car crashed.	Mgbe ahụ ụgbọ ala ahụ dara.
He is my best friend.	Ọ bụ ezigbo enyi m.
I will do something.	M ga-eme ihe.
The challenge is well known.	Ihe ịma aka ahụ maara nke ọma.
Grandmother lived alone in a room.	Nne nne bi naanị ya n'ime ụlọ.
I do not know what I am doing is wrong.	Amaghị m ihe m na-eme adịghị mma.
Do you work? 	Ị na-arụ ọrụ?
Obviously it should be.	O doro anya na ekwesịrị ịdị.

Most of them act for things.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha na-eme ihe maka ihe.
If he can't do much with it, they can.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ nweghị ike ime ọtụtụ ihe na ya, ha nwere ike.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
Warm shoes.	Akpụkpọ ụkwụ ọkụ.
He didn't seem to care.	O yiri ka ọ dịghị ihe ọ na-eche.
I was alone all that time.	Anọ m naanị m oge ahụ niile.
He saw it.	Ọ hụrụ ya.
Everyone was angry.	Onye ọ bụla were iwe.
How does that work? 	Kedu ka nke ahụ si arụ ọrụ?
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
This seems perfect.	Nke a dị ka ihe zuru oke.
It works at very high speeds.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ na oke ọsọ.
Really miss you today.	Na-eche gị taa n'ezie.
I need to tell them to stop.	M kwesịrị ịgwa ha ka ha kwụsị.
There have been no recent travel reports.	Enweghị akụkọ njem na nso nso a.
No problem.	Enweghị nsogbu ọ bụla.
Maybe that would be nice.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ ga-adị mma.
Dogs are good friends.	Nkịta bụ ezigbo enyi mmadụ.
I do not want anyone from the city to come.	Achọghị m ka onye ọ bụla si obodo na-abịa.
He looked at them both.	O lere ha abụọ anya n’aka.
Thoughts and stories.	Echiche na akụkọ ya.
But let me see.	Ma ka m hụ.
Now he can tell us to stop.	Ugbu a o nwere ike ịgwa anyị ka anyị kwụsị.
It is hopeless.	Ọ bụ enweghị olileanya.

I didn't hear anything that night.	Anaghị m anụ ụdị ihe ọ bụla n'abalị ahụ.
Books for thinking and for practical action.	Akwụkwọ maka iche echiche na maka ime ihe bara uru.
That is my real problem.	Nke ahụ bụ ezigbo nsogbu m.
They failed, of course.	Ha dara nke ọma, n'ezie.
I need it so much.	Achọrọ m ya nke ukwuu.
He was obviously angry.	O doro anya na iwe were ya.
The cost of the trip is high.	Ọnụ ego nke njem ahụ dị elu.

Maybe that's a good thing.	Ma eleghị anya, nke ahụ bụ ihe dị mma.
Or take one.	Ma ọ bụ were otu.

None of these things are easy.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a dị mfe.

The only problem is that that is not true.	Naanị nsogbu bụ na nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.
His clothes are still perfect.	Uwe ya ka zuru oke.

He brought him to life.	O mere ka ọ dị ndụ.

Therefore, it is important to move on.	Ya mere, ọ dị mkpa ịga n'ihu.

He looked at her suspiciously.	Ọ tụrụ ya enyo.
There are only so many other questions.	N'ebe ha nọ naanị ajụjụ ndị ọzọ dị.

So obviously.	Ya mere o doro anya.
No one wants to know about the community.	O nweghị onye chọrọ ịma ihe gbasara obodo.
Maybe he likes it better.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ na-amasị ya ka ọ dị mma.
She has only one child.	O nwere naanị otu nwa.

One goes for the story.	Otu na-aga maka akụkọ.
It is going well.	Ọ na-aga nke ọma.
But that is not the other way around.	Ma nke ahụ abụghị otú ọzọ.
He would never do it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-eme ya.
They never told us so.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha gwara anyị otú ahụ.

Sometimes that works out well, but sometimes it just doesn't work.	Mgbe ụfọdụ nke ahụ na-aga nke ọma, ma mgbe ụfọdụ ọ naghị adị.

Life in prison was hard.	Ndụ n'ụlọ mkpọrọ siri ike.

It requires more than letters and letters.	Ọ chọrọ karịa akwụkwọ ozi na akwụkwọ ozi.
The food turned out delicious and delicious.	Nri ahụ bịara na-atọ ụtọ ma na-atọ ụtọ.
She loved her son so much, not so much.	Ọ hụrụ nwa ya nwoke n'anya nke ukwuu, ọ bụghị nke ukwuu.
This is a beautiful house.	Nke a bụ ụlọ mara mma.
I need it on paper.	Achọrọ m ya na akwụkwọ.

He left his wallet in the car.	Ọ hapụrụ obere akpa ya n'ime ụgbọ ala.
We are who we are.	Anyị bụ ndị anyị bụ.
Is this a game?	Nke a ọ bụ egwuregwu?

None of them had a special effect or value.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha nwere mmetụta ma ọ bụ ego pụrụ iche.
She has lived with her husband for many years.	Ebe ya na di ya bi kemgbe ọtụtụ afọ.

I have some questions about the project.	Enwere m ajụjụ ụfọdụ gbasara ọrụ ahụ.

His friends called him by his first name.	Ndị enyi ya kpọrọ ya aha mbụ ya.
But he speaks every day.	Ma, ọ na-ekwu okwu kwa ụbọchị.
For some reason, he immediately saw me.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ, ọ hụrụ m ozugbo.
Just one last test.	Naanị otu ule ikpeazụ.
A little food.	Obere nri.
For years, they stopped working.	Ruo ọtụtụ afọ, ha kwụsịrị ọrụ ahụ.
It won't be long.	Ọ gaghị adị ogologo.
But first, a little history.	Ma nke mbụ, ntakịrị akụkọ ihe mere eme.
Everyone is happy.	Onye ọ bụla nwere obi ụtọ.
This problem is widespread.	Nsogbu a juru ebe niile.
The thought calmed him down.	Echiche ahụ mere ka ahụ́ ruo ya ala.
It gave him a better idea of ​​music.	O nyere ya echiche ka mma nke egwu.
One is inferior to the other.	Otu dị ala karịa nke ọzọ.
He does not expect that.	Ọ naghị atụ anya otú ahụ.
You can see him now, in his room.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ya ugbu a, n'ime ime ụlọ ya.
I love that.	Ahụrụ m ihe ahụ n'anya.
It's really good.	Ọ dị mma n'ezie.
This house is beautiful.	Ụlọ a mara mma.
This is the second year they have received this money.	Nke a bụ afọ nke abụọ ha nwetara ego a.
There are things that can be done to help.	Enwere ihe ndị a ga-eme iji nyere aka.
It's not fair.	Ọ dịghị mma.
The work was difficult at first.	Ọrụ ahụ siri ike na mbụ.
Old houses are no longer used.	A naghị eji ụlọ ochie eme ihe ọzọ.
For me, but you know, not really.	Maka m, mana ị maara, ọ bụghị n'ezie.
The shirt will not look the same.	Uwe elu agaghị adị ka otu.
Then he asked something very different.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ jụrụ ihe dị nnọọ iche.
Should see that it comes.	Kwesịrị ịhụ na ọ na-abịa.
I think the theme of the song is clear.	Echere m na isi okwu nke egwu ahụ doro anya.
Two things are more likely to happen.	Ihe abụọ yikarịrị ka ha mere.
Thank you so much for helping.	Daalụ nke ukwuu maka inye aka.
I only have one good friend.	Naanị otu ezigbo enyi m nwere.
I do not know who did it.	Amaghị m onye mere.
The community invested similarly.	Ndị obodo tinyere ego yiri nke ahụ.
This is not just an idea, this is a fact.	Nke a abụghị naanị echiche, nke a bụ eziokwu.
The houses are very small.	Ụlọ ndị ahụ dị nnọọ obere.
He was trying to get me out.	Ọ nọ na-agbalị ịpụ m.
Immediately, there.	Ozugbo ahụ, ebe ahụ.
The team was very much loved.	A hụrụ ndị otu ahụ n'anya nke ukwuu.
It is said that many men drink heavily.	A na-ekwu na ọtụtụ ụmụ nwoke na-aṅụ mmanya.
Fast and fast.	Ọsọ na ngwa ngwa.
Not a very serious game.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo egwu egwu.
The price range, however, deserves it.	Ụdị ọnụ ahịa, Otú ọ dị, kwesịrị ya.
I can't see far away.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ebe dị anya.
They think.	Ha na-eche.
This will help the family to grow stronger.	Nke a ga-enyere ezinụlọ aka ike.
There is no lie here.	Enweghị ụgha ebe a.
The kids have a hard time now.	Ụmụaka nwere oge siri ike ugbu a.
But those things can't go that way.	Ma ihe ndị ahụ enweghị ike ịga n'ụzọ ahụ.
You two go.	Unu abụọ na-aga.
We can not give to all who come.	Anyị enweghị ike inye ndị niile bịara.

It's something else.	Ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
I didn't want him to leave that night.	Achọghị m ka ọ pụọ n'abalị ahụ.
The idea of ​​a song goes into this newspaper.	Echiche nke abụ na-aga n'ime akwụkwọ akụkọ a.
We need to think it over.	Anyị kwesịrị iche echiche ya.
They think they are awesome.	Ha na-eche na ha dị oke egwu.
It is their job.	Ọ bụ ọrụ ha.
We probably would have died.	O yikarịrị ka anyị gaara anwụ.
How many people are in this company?	Mmadụ ole nọ n'ụlọ ọrụ a?
He obviously has a character.	O doro anya na o nwere agwa.
He seems interested in this.	O yiri ka ọ nwere mmasị na nke a.

You know this to be true.	Ị maara na nke a bụ eziokwu.

The fish is not playing today.	Azụ ahụ adịghị egwu egwu taa.

But nothing happened.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe merenụ.
The song made me long for a distant ocean.	Abụ ahụ mere ka m nwee agụụ maka oke osimiri dị anya.
I think it's in the water near here.	Echere m na ọ dị na mmiri dị nso ebe a.
This is not good in the heart.	Nke a adịghị mma n'obi.
Evil or stay as character is at this time.	Ihe ọjọọ ma ọ bụ nọrọ dị ka agwa ọ bụ n'oge a.
He did not want time to pass.	Ọ chọghị ka oge na-aga.
He was the first child born to his parents.	Ọ bụ nwa mbụ nne na nna ya mụrụ.

The event was a success.	Ihe omume ahụ gara nke ọma.
This can continue every day.	Nke a nwere ike ịga n'ihu kwa ụbọchị.
Then he called me forward.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ kpọrọ m n'ihu.
I want them to give it.	Achọrọ m ka ha nye ya.
They used it.	Ha ji ya mee ihe.
This book has many heights.	Akwụkwọ a nwere ọtụtụ elu.
The spirit of the city is in the village.	Mmụọ obodo dị n'ime obodo.
For a while, there would be such facilities.	Ruo oge ụfọdụ, a ga-enwe ụlọ ọrụ ndị dị otú ahụ.
She was too scared to speak.	Ụjọ tụrụ ya nke ukwuu ikwu okwu.
A group of passengers arrived.	Otu ndị njem rutere.
They are honest, but they are human.	Ha na-ekwu eziokwu, ma ha bụ mmadụ.
A small fire broke out in the theater.	Obere ọkụ gbara na ụlọ ihe nkiri ahụ.

We got a little scared and dancing.	Anyị nwetara ntakịrị egwu na ịgba egwu.
But it is not a bad feeling.	Ma ọ bụghị mmetụta ọjọọ.
He could not.	O nweghị ike.
His previous health was not good.	Ahụ ike ya gara aga adịghị mma.
We are very vigilant.	Anyị mụrụ anya nke ukwuu.
He made it seem like nothing for him.	O mere ya dị ka ọ bụghị ihe ọ bụla maka ya.
There is more in this story here.	Enwere ihe ọzọ na akụkọ a ebe a.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
Everything about it is real.	Ihe niile gbasara ya bụ n'ezie.
I am not happy with my life.	Enweghị m obi ụtọ na ndụ m.
His living brother is someone else.	Nwanne ya dị ndụ bụ onye ọzọ.

Probably so.	Nke eleghị anya ọ dị.
Both are good people.	Ha abụọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.

They asked me.	Ha jụrụ m.
It could be, of course.	O nwere ike ịbụ, n'ezie.
I can't really see it.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ya n'ezie.
Your father went twice.	Nna gị gara ugboro abụọ.

We do not have to think about it every minute of the day.	Anyị ekwesịghị iche echiche banyere ya kwa nkeji nke ụbọchị.

Water is essential for all living things.	Mmiri dị mkpa maka ihe niile dị ndụ.
We should do it for our children.	Anyị kwesịrị ime ya maka ụmụ anyị.
For this time alone.	Maka naanị oge a.
So we made it a game.	Ya mere, anyị mere ya ka ọ bụrụ egwuregwu.
However, he deserves it.	Otú ọ dị, o kwesịrị ya.
This has two effects.	Nke a nwere mmetụta abụọ.
As it is, one.	Dị ka ọ dị, otu.
Of course it is unplanned.	N'ezie ọ bụ enweghị atụmatụ.
At best.	Na kacha mma.
It's just that we're busy.	Ọ bụ naanị na anyị ji ọrụ n'aka.
Twenty minutes, that’s good.	Nkeji iri abụọ, nke ahụ dị mma.

So who do you see today?	Ya mere, onye ka ị hụrụ taa?
But obesity time is bad.	Ma oge ibu dị njọ.
Of course this is not true.	N'ezie nke a abụghị eziokwu.

It seems to be true.	Ọ dị ka ihe bụ eziokwu.
Many people asked me the same question.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ jụrụ m otu ajụjụ ahụ.

This is a beautiful place.	Nke a bụ ebe mara mma.

Neither is good.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla dị mma.

But it may not be.	Ma ọ nwere ike ịbụ ma ọ bụghị.
When in doubt.	Mgbe enwere obi abụọ.
But there is talk of that.	Mana enwere okwu na nke ahụ.
Almost all car companies are independent.	Fọrọ nke nta ka ụlọ ọrụ ụgbọ ala niile nwere onwe ha.
We do not want a reason.	Anyị achọghị ihe kpatara ya.
These things are greater than the law-makers.	Ihe ndị a karịrị ndị na-eme iwu.
We work games on a team.	Anyị na-arụ ọrụ egwuregwu na otu.
The place is beautiful and the houses are beautiful.	Ebe ahụ mara mma ma ụlọ ndị ahụ mara mma.
There are no conditions.	Enweghị ọnọdụ ọ bụla.
Not so.	Ọ bụghị otú ọ dị.
This is what that is.	Nke a bụ ihe nke ahụ dị.
He promised to make me happy.	O kwere nkwa na ọ ga-eme m obi ụtọ.
But that is a very simple message.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ozi dị nnọọ mfe.
I think he can do whatever he wants.	Echere m na ọ nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla ọ chọrọ.
Hardly any game.	O siri ike egwuregwu ọ bụla.
He looked at the look of his life.	O lere anya n'anya ndụ ndụ ya.
So we know we are strong.	Ya mere anyị maara na anyị siri ike.
The room was packed.	Ndị mmadụ juru n'ọnụ ụlọ ahụ.
They could have easily done that, a long time ago.	Ha gaara eme nke ahụ n'ụzọ dị mfe, ogologo oge gara aga.
We don't play games.	Anyị anaghị egwu egwu.
The road goes along the big river.	Ụzọ ahụ na-aga n'akụkụ nnukwu osimiri.
It is a beautiful car.	Ọ bụ ụgbọ ala mara mma.
It is different from the first.	Ọ dị iche na mbụ.

Of course, they are worse.	N'ezie, ha ka njọ.
They can only be used once.	Enwere ike iji ha naanị otu ugboro.
It is a matter of self.	Ọ bụ ihe gbasara onwe ya.
There is no word on it.	Enweghị okwu maka ya.
I asked again for this kind of idea.	M jụrụ ụdị echiche a ọzọ.

Let me get you a book.	Ka m nweta gị akwụkwọ.
The theater has no interest in the game.	Ụlọ ihe nkiri ahụ enweghị mmasị na egwuregwu ahụ.
The tower should be the same height.	Ụlọ elu kwesịrị ịdị elu otu.
There was a full moon last night.	Enwere ọnwa zuru oke n'abalị ụnyaahụ.

Everyone has money.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ego.
But that is impossible.	Mana nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume.
Maybe he was waiting for someone.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ nọ na-eche mmadụ.
The weather is not cold for the time of year.	Ihu igwe adịghị oyi maka oge n'afọ.
This may be easier said than done.	Nke a nwere ike ịdị mfe ikwu karịa ime ya.
We were just waiting.	Anyị nọ nnọọ na-eche.

But this is a story.	Ma nke a bụ akụkọ.
My girlfriend is not going to the party.	Enyi m nwanyị agaghị aga oriri ahụ.
He wanted to follow her.	Ọ chọrọ iso ya.
Then you have to cook.	Mgbe ahụ ị ga-esi nri.
They slapped each other on the back.	Ha mara ibe ha ụra n’azụ.
It is a means to an end.	Ọ bụ ihe ọ ga-eji mee ya.

The water is warm, almost colorless, but it tastes good.	Mmiri dị ọkụ, ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ enweghị agba, mana ọ na-atọ ụtọ.

But no one knows that until it actually happens.	Ma ọ dịghị onye maara nke ahụ ruo mgbe ọ ga-eme n'ezie.

However, the information provided is still basic.	Otú ọ dị, ozi e nyere ka bụ nke bụ isi.

When you want someone, you want to see it.	Mgbe ị chọrọ mmadụ, ị chọrọ ahụ ya.
However, something like that.	Otú ọ dị, ihe dị ka ya.
That is one of the reasons we are so close.	Ọ bụ otu n’ime ihe mere anyị ji nọrọ nso.

Only now can we know.	Ọ bụ naanị ugbu a anyị nwere ike ịma.

However, there is another kind of hunger.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ụdị agụụ ọzọ.

At the time, they had a good chance.	N'oge ahụ, ha nwere ezigbo ohere.

I'm sorry to see them like that.	Ahụ adị m njọ ịhụ ha otú ahụ.

Bad news there.	Akụkọ ọjọọ ebe ahụ.

He took the bag.	O were akpa ahụ.

However, I did not do much watering.	Otú ọ dị, emeghị m mmiri nke ukwuu.

It would have been a truly historic meeting.	Ọ gaara abụ nzukọ akụkọ ihe mere eme n'ezie.
They are lying to find people.	Ha bụ ụgha ịchọta ndị mmadụ.

Take the new employee around the office or building.	Were onye ọrụ ọhụrụ ahụ gaa gburugburu ụlọ ọrụ ma ọ bụ ụlọ.

In each car, a police officer was present.	N'ime ụgbọ ala nke ọ bụla, onye uwe ojii nọ.
Our bags have no land.	Akpa anyị enweghị ala.
That's where the problem lies.	Ọ bụ ebe ahụ ka o nwere nsogbu.

For one thing, we do not paint.	Otu ihe bụ na anyị anaghị agba agba.

Sometimes that is the body.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ihe ahụ bụ ahụ.

That’s what you need to know.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ị chọrọ ịma.

Nothing happens during this trip.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla na-eme n'oge njem a.

He was given an easy second chance.	E nyere ya ohere nke abụọ dị mfe.
He could not get out.	Ọ nweghị ike ịpụ.
That is more important than anything else.	Nke ahụ dị mkpa karịa ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
But that's not very good.	Mana nke ahụ adịghị mma nke ukwuu.

There are two ways we do this.	Enwere ụzọ abụọ anyị si eme nke a.

At the time, you could not do anything at all.	N'oge ahụ, ị ​​nweghị ike ime ihe ọ bụla.
So they knew what it was.	Ya mere, ha maara ihe ọ bụ.
Your children do not use it.	Ụmụ gị anaghị eji ya.

It is impossible to please everyone.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume ime onye ọ bụla ụtọ.
He was wondering why.	Ọ nọ na-eche ihe kpatara ya.
The problem is that they are new to me.	Nsogbu bụ na ha dị ọhụrụ nye m.
He loves the same.	Ọ hụrụ otu ihe ahụ n'anya.
His name is really good.	Aha ya bụ ezigbo ihe n'ezie.

Life will not be good.	Ndụ agaghị adị mma.
She died in infancy.	Ọ nwụrụ na nwata.
Everything works well and beautifully.	Ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma ma mara mma.
But this is a big deal.	Mana nke a bụ nnukwu ihe.
He wanted to run, but he had no choice.	Ọ chọrọ ịgba ọsọ, ma o nweghị ihe ọzọ ọ ga-eme.
He left the building suddenly.	Ọ hapụrụ ụlọ ahụ na mberede.
These photos make sense.	Foto ndị a bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
He is a good family football player.	Ọ bụ ya bụ ezigbo onye na-agba bọọlụ nke ezinụlọ.

But from time to time, our hopes were dashed.	Ma site n'oge ruo n'oge, olileanya anyị dara.
Soon we both stopped running.	N'oge na-adịghị anya, anyị abụọ kwụsịrị ịgba ọsọ.

In fact, he is more interested now than in music.	N'ezie, o nwere mmasị ugbu a karịa egwu.
All words are bad.	Okwu niile dị njọ.

Two beds are laid twice a year.	A na-atụ akwa abụọ ugboro abụọ n'afọ.

He obviously knew you were a police officer.	O doro anya na ọ maara na ị bụ onye uwe ojii.
Go your own way, do your own thing.	Na-aga n'ụzọ nke gị, mee ihe nke gị.
All his power is in his hand.	Ike ya niile dị n’aka ya.
Each situation is different.	Ọnọdụ ọ bụla dị iche.
It's not strong.	Ọ dịghị ike.
No two people are so affected by the same thing.	Ọ dịghị mmadụ abụọ nwere mmetụta nke ukwuu bụ otu.

So people run because of that, right.	Ya mere, ndị mmadụ na-agba ọsọ n'ihi nke ahụ, nri.
Her brother has it coming.	Nwanne ya nwoke nwere ya na-abịa.
Would you like to.	Ọ ga-amasị gị.

If so, she may have been a widow.	Ọ bụrụ otú ahụ, ọ ga-abụ na ọ bụ ya kpatara ya.

Maybe he kicked her.	Ma eleghị anya ọ na-agba ya ụkwụ.
Most people here have none.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ebe a enweghị nke ọ bụla.
He did not know what had happened to them.	Ọ maghị ihe mere ha.

Now you look like every other man.	Ugbu a, ị dị ka nwoke ọ bụla ọzọ.

Making money in your home is a good thing.	Inye ego n'ụlọ gị bụ ihe dị mma.

You have to do this very well.	Ị ga-eme nke a nke ọma.
Everything seemed so fun.	Ihe niile yiri ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
Everything seemed fine.	Ihe niile chere na ọ dị mma.

Everywhere we went there was a lot of history.	Ebe ọ bụla anyị gara nwere ọtụtụ akụkọ ihe mere eme.

I was shocked by the violence.	Ime ihe ike juru m anya.
If you want to talk to me, talk to me.	Ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ ịgwa m okwu, gwa m okwu.

Sometimes in length.	Mgbe ụfọdụ na ogologo.
I'm afraid of him.	Ana m atụ ya egwu.
Your past is not my job.	Oge gara aga gị abụghị ọrụ m.
I was just having a bad day.	Naanị ụbọchị ọjọọ ka m nọ.
The second is the movie.	Nke abụọ bụ ihe nkiri.
The movie is very much loved.	Ihe nkiri ahụ hụrụ n'anya nke ukwuu.
Courts should not be taken lightly.	Ụlọ ikpe ekwesịghị ịga n'ụzọ dị mfe.
Everything is inside of us.	Ihe niile dị n'ime anyị.
At times, he enjoyed lowly life.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ndụ dị ala na-atọ ya ụtọ.
Just what you want to go for.	Naanị ihe ị chọrọ ka ị ga-aga.
And have the same name.	Ma nwee otu aha.
That's fine, said the man.	Nke ahụ dị mma, ka nwoke ahụ kwuru.
We all love you.	Anyị niile hụrụ gị n'anya.
I said.	M kwuru.
He asked about my plans for the lunch break.	Ọ jụrụ banyere atụmatụ m maka ezumike ehihie.
The conditions are the same as in the previous study.	Ọnọdụ ndị ahụ dị ka ọ dị na ọmụmụ ihe mbụ.
That is obvious.	Nke ahụ doro anya.
There is a market for both. 	Enwere ahịa maka ha abụọ. 
The latter got my name very much.	Nke ikpeazụ ahụ nwetara aha m nke ukwuu.
no problem using it.	enweghị nsogbu iji ya.
And one funny thing.	Na otu ihe ọchị.
They like you.	Ha na-amasị gị.
You are not really guilty.	Ị bụghị ikpe mara n'ezie.
But they went, and we do not know why.	Ma ha gara, ma anyị amaghị ihe kpatara ya.
This surprised many.	Nke a tụrụ ọtụtụ mmadụ n'anya.
Not true.	Ọ bụghị eziokwu.
He wants it.	Ọ chọrọ ya.
I can only do one person a day.	Enwere m ike ime naanị otu onye otu ụbọchị.
But then he knew what to do.	Ma mgbe ahụ ọ maara ihe ọ ga-eme.
Phone.	Ekwentị.
You make it easy.	Ị na-eme ka ọ dị mfe.
We suggest again.	Anyị na-atụ aro ọzọ.
No one knows how many.	O nweghị onye ma ole.
That is what the judges did.	Otú ahụ ka ndị ikpe mere.
It is worth it.	Ọ bụ ihe bara uru.
But it did happen.	Ma o mechara mee.
I doubt it took that long, his story.	Enwere m obi abụọ na ọ were ogologo oge ahụ, akụkọ ya.
Too much doesn’t matter.	Oke adịghị mkpa.
His work is very beautiful.	Ọrụ ya mara oke mma.
There is something wrong.	Ọ nwere ihe adịghị mma.
This is my song.	Nke a bụ abụ m.
You can do this as you go.	Ị nwere ike ime nke a ka ị na-aga.
I'm different.	Adị m iche.
This is her dress.	Nke a bụ akwa ya.
He was sure he had it.	O ji n'aka na o nwetara ya.
It should have gone a few weeks ago.	O kwesịrị ịla izu ole na ole gara aga.
I think that's very good.	Echere m na nke ahụ dị ezigbo mma.
The house is coming well.	Ụlọ ahụ na-abịa nke ọma.
Everything works fine.	Ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
But they have a point.	Ma ha nwere isi ihe.
No legal effect.	Enweghị mmetụta iwu.
My hope is a little bit different.	Olileanya m bụ ntakịrị ntakịrị.
They run all the time.	Ha na-agba ọsọ mgbe ọ bụla.
It's like a fish.	Ọ dị ka ụdị azụ.
This is my opinion.	Nke a bụ echiche m.
The girl's laughter suddenly frightened me.	Ọchị nwa agbọghọ ahụ na mberede tụrụ m ụjọ.
No one saw him for what he was.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya maka ihe ọ bụ.
We still have a long way to go.	Anyị ka nwere ụzọ anyị ga-esi gaa.
Two of them really.	Abụọ n'ime ha n'ezie.
Such messages are not waiting.	Ozi ndị dị otú ahụ anaghị echere.
Wear different clothes.	Yiri uwe dị iche iche.
Then a girl from another school became interested.	Mgbe ahụ, otu nwa agbọghọ si ụlọ akwụkwọ ọzọ na-enwe mmasị.
You have everything you need.	Ị nwere ihe niile ị chọrọ.
I can’t speak for the big thing happening.	Enweghị m ike ikwu maka nnukwu ihe na-eme.
That is why it will not be just ten.	Ọ bụ ya mere na ọ gaghị abụ naanị iri.
I would like that.	Ọ ga-amasị m nke ahụ.
I can't do that.	Enweghị m ike ime nke ahụ.
She is her husband.	Ọ bụ di ya.
Not for this information.	Ọ bụghị maka ozi a.
I think housing is a good example of that.	Echere m na ụlọ bụ ezigbo ihe atụ maka nke ahụ.
But that was just my opinion.	Mana nke ahụ bụ naanị echiche m.
However, in everything else, it does not work as required.	Otú ọ dị, na ihe ọ bụla ọzọ, ọ naghị arụ ọrụ dị ka achọrọ.
It's small.	Ọ dị obere.
There you have it.	N'ebe ahụ ka ị nwere ya.
It is important.	Ọ dị mkpa.
But it will not do any good.	Ma ọ gaghị eme ihe ọma ọ bụla.
Absolute value for money.	Uru zuru oke maka ego.
He is a family owned company.	Ọ bụ onye ezinụlọ nwere ụlọ ọrụ ahụ.
Please keep your spirits up.	Biko mee ka mmụọ gị dị mma.
Again this is good.	Ọzọ nke a dị mma.
But no one wants to go.	Ma ọ dịghị onye chọrọ ịga.
It is firm flesh, the skin is warm.	Ọ bụ anụ ahụ siri ike, akpụkpọ ahụ dị ọkụ.
The group is old friends.	Ndị otu ahụ bụ ndị enyi ochie.
It's too cold.	Oyi juru oyi.
You do all the work.	Ị na-arụ ọrụ niile.
We think only of ourselves.	Anyị na-eche naanị anyị.
If there is a house, it will be here.	Ọ bụrụ na e nwere ụlọ, ọ ga-abụ ebe a.
Probably not.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị ya kpatara ya.
This happened a year ago.	Nke a mere otu afọ gara aga.
It's really a plan.	Ọ bụ n'ezie atụmatụ.
One big question asked the school we went to.	Otu isi ajụjụ jụrụ ụlọ akwụkwọ anyị gara.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
People have value there.	Ụmụ mmadụ nwere uru n'ebe ahụ.
It's just, we do not know how.	Ọ bụ naanị, anyị amaghị otú.
Maybe she knew that her son was not that particular person.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ ma na nwa ya nwoke abụghị ụdị onye ahụ.
All their lives, things are the same.	Ndụ ha niile, ihe bụ otu ụzọ.
But not many girls.	Ma ọ bụghị ọtụtụ ụmụ agbọghọ.
We can go all out.	Anyị nwere ike ịga ihe niile.
It will not be this time.	Ọ gaghị abụ oge a.
The idea itself is old.	Echiche n'onwe ya bụ ochie.
She was behind the man who was running.	Ọ nọ n'azụ nwoke ahụ na-agba ọsọ.
It is our strength.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ike anyị.
They still exist.	Ha ka dị.
I do not like it.	Enweghị m mmasị na ya.
Max is thirteen books per person.	Oke bụ akwụkwọ iri na atọ maka onye ọ bụla.
And life through them again.	Na ndụ site na ha ọzọ.
But that is our life.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ndụ anyị.
I have a difficult question.	Enwere m ajụjụ siri ike.
I will not see him.	Agaghị m ahụ ya.
I do not think so.	Echeghị m.
The meeting was well attended.	Ndị bịara ọmụmụ ihe ahụ nke ọma.
Our first such trip took two days.	Njem mbụ anyị dị otú ahụ were ụbọchị abụọ.
I have everything here.	Enwere m ihe niile ebe a.
He reads with a mind.	O ji uche na-agụ ihe.
That is good.	Nke ahụ dị mma.
Now this is something special.	Ugbu a nke a bụ ihe pụrụ iche.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
Their house is small.	Ụlọ ha dị obere.
We would love to see them!	Ọ ga-amasị anyị ịhụ ha!
Not a good thing.	Ọ bụghị ezigbo ihe.
Once, twice, several times.	Otu ugboro, ugboro abụọ, ọtụtụ ugboro.
Everyone says they really enjoy it.	Onye ọ bụla na-ekwu na ha na-atọ ụtọ n'ezie.
He asked me why he wanted me.	Ọ jụrụ m ihe mere o ji chọọ m.
Today is a big day.	Taa bụ nnukwu ụbọchị.
I shot him maybe twice.	M gbara ya ma eleghị anya ugboro abụọ.
If you got the picture, we will be happy.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nweta foto ahụ, anyị ga-enwe obi ụtọ.
None of them really said they knew it.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ha kwuru n'ezie na ha maara ya.
It seems to be well known.	Ọ dị ka a maara nke ọma.
That goes for his career.	Nke ahụ na-aga maka ọrụ ya.
It looks like he was born for this period.	Ọ dị ka a mụrụ ya maka oge a.
However, this is in the past.	Otú ọ dị, nke a bụ n'oge gara aga.
This photo is other words.	Foto a bụ okwu ndị ọzọ.
If you have two things, they should be treated differently.	Ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ihe abụọ, ha kwesịrị ka onye ọ bụla na-eme ihe dị iche iche.
An important issue.	Okwu dị mkpa.
Many such examples abound.	Ọtụtụ ihe atụ ndị dị otú ahụ juru.
It met my eye so well.	O zutere anya m nke ọma.
We are a city.	Anyị bụ obodo.
They have no time to speak.	Ha enweghị oge ikwu okwu.
This could be his life.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ ndụ ya.
But if you want to be.	Ma ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ ịbụ.
I do not like it a little.	Ọ naghị amasị m ntakịrị.
Wait a moment, please.	Chere nwa oge, biko.
He knows how to please others.	Ọ ma ka esi eme ndị ọzọ obi ụtọ.
He hated everything.	Ọ kpọrọ ihe niile asị.
From these facts.	Site na eziokwu ndị a.
I don’t really know for sure.	Amaghị m n'ezie na nke m.
One is absolutely interested to take such an opportunity.	Otu onye nwere mmasị zuru oke iji were ohere dị otú ahụ.
Know where he is.	Mara ebe ọ nọ.
They go hand in hand.	Ha na-aga aka na aka.
Whoever it is will be behind everything else.	Onye ọ bụla ọ bụ ga-abụ n'azụ ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
All he needed to do was go smoothly.	Naanị ihe ọ chọrọ ka ọ were were na-aga.
This is where we arrived.	Nke a bụ ebe anyị rutere.
None of those things he did.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị ahụ o mere.
That should not happen.	Nke ahụ ekwesịghị ime.
I have a mouth for it really.	Enwere m ọnụ maka ya n'ezie.
He desperately needed her.	Ọ chọrọ ya nke ukwuu.
This is, of course, what happened.	Nke a bụ, n'ezie, ihe merenụ.
The countryside is full of people.	Ndị mmadụ juru n'ime ime obodo.
The students were helpless despite the violence.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ ahụ enweghị enyemaka n'agbanyeghị ime ihe ike.
The village has a big house.	Ime obodo nwere nnukwu ụlọ.
More than that, they have no idea.	Ihe karịrị nke ahụ, ha enweghị echiche.
The policeman is happy!	Onye uwe ojii ahụ nwere obi ụtọ!
Just tell the boy.	Naanị agwa nwa nwoke ahụ.
He was never satisfied.	Ọ dịghị mgbe afọ juru ya.
It works or it doesn't work.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ ma ọ bụ na-adịghị arụ ọrụ.
These are just a few test cases.	Ndị a bụ ikpe ule ole na ole.
Different facial expressions.	Ụdị ihu dị iche iche.
Everyone has a day up and down.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ụbọchị elu na ala.
Of course, they knew it.	O doro anya na ha maara ya.
This they did not.	Nke a ka ha emeghị.
Until then.	Ruo mgbe ọ.
I love it there.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya ebe ahụ.
His visit was marked by tears, not a tear.	Ebe ọ gara ebe ahụ ka ibe ákwá ka ukwuu, ọ bụghị obere.
He spoke every word.	O kwuru okwu ọ bụla.
It is possible to go further than this.	O kwere omume ịga n'ihu karịa nke a.
But it will happen if it can.	Ma ọ ga-eme ma ọ bụrụ na ọ nwere ike.
Tell me the other one, do it.	Gwa m nke ọzọ, mee.
But it was not successful.	Ma ọ bụghị ihe ịga nke ọma.
He ordered that it be done.	O tinyere iwu ka o mere.
He can see me more than anyone else.	O nwere ike ịhụ m karịa onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
Give me time to think.	Nye m oge iche echiche.
That will not happen in two years.	Nke ahụ agaghị eme n'ime afọ abụọ.
When it did, then.	Mgbe o mere, mgbe ahụ.
For some cities information is not available to everyone.	Maka obodo ụfọdụ ozi adịghị maka ndị mmadụ niile.
He did not know how long he had been away.	Ọ maghị ogologo oge ọ gara.
They want to travel, but they have no money.	Ha chọrọ ime njem, ma ha enweghị ego.
They are both very strong.	Ha abụọ siri ezigbo ike.
Others are wise.	Ndị ọzọ mara ihe.
Stupid! 	Onye nzuzu!
Drink plenty of cold water.	Na-aṅụ ọtụtụ mmiri oyi.
It's as simple as that.	Ọ dị mfe dị ka nke ahụ.
These examples are very important.	Ihe atụ ndị a dị ezigbo mkpa.
A man spoke to me.	Otu nwoke gwara m okwu.
However, there are still some uncertainties.	Otú ọ dị, a ka nwere ụfọdụ ejighị n'aka.
The only thing I made different.	Naanị ihe m mere ka ọ dị iche.
Very stupid.	Dị nnọọ nzuzu.
It was just a house on the sidewalk.	Ọ bụ naanị ụlọ dị n'akụkụ.
He knows her well.	Ọ maara ya nke ukwuu.
Still, nobody came for them.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ dịghị onye bịara maka ha.
It is what you want.	Ọ bụ ihe ị chọrọ.
They left, but as some speakers did.	Ha hapụrụ, ma, dị ka ụfọdụ ndị na-ekwu okwu mere.
This is another matter we have.	Nke a bụ okwu ọzọ anyị nwere.
And this is a big impact.	Na nke a bụ nnukwu mmetụta.
But this will never happen.	Ma nke a agaghị eme ma ọlị.
It is the same school.	Ọ bụ otu ụlọ akwụkwọ.
He is in a better place.	Ọ nọ n'ebe ka mma.
It will be a big challenge.	Ọ ga-abụ nnukwu ihe isi ike.
Any help would be fine.	Enyemaka ọ bụla ga-adị mma.
A game or two.	Otu egwuregwu ma ọ bụ abụọ.
The trip took two days.	Njem ahụ were ụbọchị abụọ.
One by one.	Otu na ibe.
The patient is not interested.	Onye ọrịa ahụ enweghị mmasị.
I do not know how.	Achọghị m ịma otú.
If this is required, fine.	Ọ bụrụ na nke a chọrọ, ọ dị mma.
He was amazed.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.
They are yours.	Ha bụ nke gị.
I think it probably is not working properly.	Echere m na ọ ga-abụ na ọ naghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
They can have it.	Ha nwere ike inwe ya.
A man is something that has two legs.	Nwoke bụ ihe nwere ụkwụ abụọ.
I like my way.	Ụzọ m na-atọ m ụtọ.
Being alone is perfect.	Ịnọ naanị ya zuru oke.
Nothing we do here is perfect.	Ọ nweghị ihe anyị na-eme ebe a zuru oke.
It will be a short time.	Ọ ga-abụ obere oge.
This is their favorite food.	Nke a bụ nri kacha amasị ha.
He is with his family.	Ya na ezinụlọ ya nọ.
Angered, they stopped immediately.	Ebe ọ bụ na iwe were ya, ha kwụsịrị ozugbo.
This job requires a lot of money.	Ọrụ a chọrọ nnukwu ego.
I think your last words are the most important.	Echere m na okwu ikpeazụ gị kacha mkpa.
I know this, but it's not the reason.	Amaara m nke a, mana ọ bụghị ihe kpatara ya.
I feel like it will be a few months ahead.	Ọ dị m ka ọ ga-abụ ọnwa ole na ole n'ihu.
The villagers were given extra hours off work.	E nyere ndị obodo ahụ awa ọzọ oge ezumike ọrụ.
You are ready.	Ị dị njikere.
Everything is there and works perfectly.	Ihe niile dị ebe ahụ ma na-arụ ọrụ zuru oke.
The whole school failed miserably.	Ụlọ akwụkwọ niile dara nke ukwuu.
If you really have that feeling, eat before you go.	Ọ bụrụ n'ezie na ị nwere mmetụta ahụ, rie nri tupu ịga.
He would have been scared.	Ọ gaara atụ egwu.
I may not be a real person.	Enwere m ike ọ gaghị abụ onye dị adị.
Of course he did not know.	N'ezie ọ maghị.
We do things only what we can do.	Anyị na-eme ihe naanị anyị nwere ike ime.
It will not be necessary.	Ọ gaghị adị mkpa.
But we are close.	Mana anyị nọ nso.
It is real.	Ọ dị adị.
The people of the city valued these beautiful old buildings.	Ndị obodo ahụ ji ụlọ ochie ndị a mara mma kpọrọ ihe.
Your employees have the information.	Ndị ọrụ gị nwere ozi ahụ.
I just need to talk to you.	Naanị m kwesịrị ịgwa gị okwu.
I can't get out.	Enweghị m ike ịpụ.
This is not the same as litigation.	Nke a abụghị otu na ịgba akwụkwọ.
This works well.	Nke a na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
He wants to get out.	Ọ chọrọ ịpụ.
Eat your greens!	Rie akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ gị!
The message will come automatically.	Ozi ga-abịa n'onwe ya.
It does not use.	Ọ naghị eji.
Probably nothing.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dịghị ihe.
We can't find it anywhere.	Anyị enweghị ike ịhụ ya ebe ọ bụla.
No significant effect.	Enweghị mmetụta dị mkpa.
He left her a little.	Ọ hapụrụ ya ntakịrị.
That's fine.	Nke ahụ dị mma.
I am happy to be doing this work.	Obi dị m ụtọ na m na-arụ ọrụ a.
I have to do some pretty hard things.	Ekwesịrị m ime ụfọdụ ihe siri ike mara mma.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
No one saw it.	Ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya.
They thought they were almost angry.	Ha chere na ọ fọrọ nke nta ka iwe were ha.
It was definitely something special.	O doro anya na ọ bụ ihe pụrụ iche.
That is a big deal.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu mmadụ.
Will you help ?.	Ị ga-enyere aka?.
This is not what he says.	Nke a abụghị ihe ọ na-ekwu.
That is what he promised.	Ọ bụ ihe o kwere ya nkwa.
We made a lot of good plans here.	Anyị mere ọtụtụ ezigbo atụmatụ ebe a.
But some do not.	Ma ụfọdụ adịghị eme ya.
Newspapers.	Akwụkwọ akụkọ.
The best day of my life.	Ụbọchị kacha mma na ndụ m.
I need it.	Achọrọ m ya.
I did not see it coming.	Ahụghị m na ọ na-abịa.
I need a report.	Achọrọ m akụkọ.
This issue is not clear to us.	Okwu a anọghị anyị nke ọma.
None of the patients came at the window.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime ndị ọrịa ahụ bịara na oge windo.
No, they are not.	Mba, ha abụghị.
I do not have time.	Enweghị m oge.
In this life.	N'ime ndụ a.
She needs new clothes.	Ọ chọrọ uwe ọhụrụ.
All the time, 'he said.	Mgbe niile,' ka o kwuru.
So if anything you forgive me.	Ya mere, ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla i ji m mgbaghara.
Some are obvious, such as making a phone call.	Ụfọdụ doro anya, dị ka ịkpọ ekwentị.
He knows that very well.	Nke ahụ ọ̀ maara nke ọma.
Everyone there thought it was a good idea.	Onye ọ bụla nọ ebe ahụ chere na ọ bụ ezigbo echiche.
They are really a game for us.	Na ha bụ n'ezie egwuregwu maka anyị.
He spoke at length about the matter.	O kwuru ogologo oge banyere okwu ahụ.
This can be done at any time.	Enwere ike ime otú ahụ mgbe niile.
A woman says this.	Nwanyị na-ekwu otu a.
Then our music started playing there.	Mgbe ahụ, abụ anyị malitere ịkpọ n'ebe ahụ.
Do the last one, before you do the first one.	Mee nke ikpeazụ, tupu i mee nke mbụ.
Good movie.	Ezigbo ihe nkiri.
You will come to suggest one.	Ị ga-abịa tụrụ aro otu.
Longevity here is low.	Ogologo ndụ ebe a dị ala.
I want to go home.	Achọrọ m ịla n'ụlọ.
So he was successful in his mission.	Ya mere, ọ gara nke ọma n'ọrụ ya.
It is a small town with little to see.	Ọ bụ obere obodo na-enweghị ọtụtụ ihe ịhụ.
I am happy for both of you.	Obi dị m ụtọ maka unu abụọ.
I have the feeling he wants.	Enwere m mmetụta ọ chọrọ.
How can this be.	Kedu ka nke a nwere ike isi mee.
You are well aware of your current strengths.	Ị maara nke ọma maka ike gị ugbu a.
Maybe he is not doing well at that.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ naghị eme nke ọma na nke ahụ.
At one point, everything was different.	N'otu oge, ihe niile dị iche.
We came here last night.	Anyị bịara ebe a n'abalị ụnyaahụ.
Of course, those are very important.	N'ezie, ndị ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa.
In the meantime.	Ma ugbu a.
We live in it.	Anyị bi na ya.
The food was good, nothing special.	Nri ahụ dị mma, ọ nweghị ihe pụrụ iche.
They will be far away.	Ha ga-adị anya.
The human heart.	Obi mmadụ.
The woman loved the beautiful head.	Nwanyị nwanyị ahụ hụrụ onye isi mara mma n'anya.
You have to go.	Ị ga-aga.
The second week is the same.	Izu nke abụọ bụ otu ihe ahụ.
It can be minutes.	O nwere ike ịbụ nkeji.
There are some types of situations.	Enwere ụdị ọnọdụ.
Certainly not.	O doro anya na ọ bụghị otú ahụ.

Two minutes can seem like a long time.	Nkeji abụọ nwere ike ịdị ka ogologo oge.
But it does not work.	Ma ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
I hope you have a good week.	Enwere m olileanya na ị nwere izu ọma.
I think it could be something else.	Echere m na ọ nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọzọ.
Individually, it does not exist.	N'otu n'otu, ọ dịghị adị.
We think.	Anyị na-eche.
One day he got angry.	Otu ụbọchị ọ were iwe.
We will do something important.	Anyị ga-eme ihe dị mkpa.
Once, once, we stayed home.	Otu ugboro, otu ugboro, anyị nọrọ n'ụlọ.
He knew that day would come and he was now here.	Ọ maara na ụbọchị a ga-abịa ma ugbu a ọ dị ebe a.
They are familiar with the song.	Ha maara abụ ahụ nke ọma.
It is my hometown.	Ọ bụ obodo m.
The chief of staff will come from the same.	Onye isi ndị ọrụ ya ga-esi n'ime otu.
Tears could not help me.	Anya mmiri enweghị ike inyere m aka.
That is why it is so important to run.	Ọ bụ ya mere o ji dị mkpa ka ị na-agba ọsọ.
The boat is a big boat.	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ bụ nnukwu ụgbọ mmiri.
He could not have done better than that.	Ọ nweghị ike ime nke ọma karịa nke ahụ.
None of this is true.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụ eziokwu.
Or my job anywhere else, of course.	Ma ọ bụ ọrụ m ebe ọ bụla ọzọ, n'ezie.
In his youth.	N'oge ọ bụ nwata.

Did not see any negative effects.	Ahụghị mmetụta dị njọ.
There is something for everyone.	Enwere ihe maka onye ọ bụla.
Worse, they do not work properly.	Nke ka njọ, ha anaghị arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
That is obvious.	Nke ahụ doro anya.
Which, by the way, is.	Nke, n'ụzọ, ọ bụ.
It works in two ways.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ abụọ.
Why am I on my right?	Kedu ihe m ji aka nri m.
Just not all tests.	Naanị ọ bụghị ule niile.
She will be a help to her dear son.	Ọ ga-abụ enyemaka na ezigbo nwa ya.

The effects of the cold had a profound effect on the future.	Mmetụta nke oyi ahụ nwere mmetụta nke ukwuu n'ihu.

We will not run.	Anyị agaghị agba ọsọ.
You can move on.	Ị nwere ike ịga n'ihu.
But then it stopped again.	Ma ọzọ ọ kwụsịrị.
Then, suddenly, they are right in front of us.	Mgbe ahụ, na mberede, ha nọ n'ebe ahụ n'ihu anyị.

Still, it will not be used unnecessarily.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, a gaghị eji ya eme ihe n'ụzọ na-enweghị isi.

He said the project will be successful.	O kwuru na ọrụ a ga-aga nke ọma.
At the same time there is a problem at home.	N'otu oge ahụ enwere nsogbu n'ụlọ.

He needs time for himself.	Ọ chọrọ oge maka onwe ya.
Often, year in and year out, a little bit.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, afọ na afọ, ntakịrị ntakịrị.
He had a job he loved.	O nwere ọrụ ọ hụrụ n'anya.
But it is still beautiful.	Ma ọ ka mara mma.
The other is psychological.	Nke ọzọ bụ nke uche.
This city is known for its handicrafts.	A maara obodo a maka ọrụ aka ya.

But this is the way it is.	Ma otu a ka ọ dị.
He did everything we needed to do.	O mere ihe niile dị anyị mkpa ka o mee.
For now.	Maka ugbu a.
It is a beautiful lie, but a lie is the same.	Ọ bụ ụgha mara mma, ma ụgha bụ otu ihe ahụ.

He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
Then the fish is by the boat.	Mgbe ahụ azụ̀ dị n'akụkụ ụgbọ mmiri.

Now you will be.	Ugbu a ị ga-abụ.

I could have had a better situation.	Enwere m ike inwe ọnọdụ ka mma.
But the situation does not work.	Ma ọnọdụ ahụ anaghị arụ ọrụ.
A bedridden man goes to a restaurant.	Otu nwoke akwa akwa gara n'otu ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ.

We need to know who we really are.	Anyị kwesịrị ịma ndị anyị bụ n’ezie.
He wonders how old he really is.	Ọ na-eche afọ ole ọ bụ n'ezie.
But it will not do you any good.	Mana ọ gaghị eme gị nke ọma ntakịrị.
Everyone has negative feelings.	Onye ọ bụla nwere echiche ọjọọ.

With terrible music, bad words are on the front.	Na egwu dị egwu, okwu ọjọọ dị n'ihu ahụ.

Again, she was waiting for him at the door.	Ọzọ, ọ nọ na-eche ya n'ọnụ ụzọ.

He said the same thing himself.	O kwuru otu a n'onwe ya kwa.
I think it is the most important.	Echere m na ọ kacha mkpa.
If there are no moral laws, it is not good.	Ọ bụrụ na e nweghị iwu omume, ọ dịghị mma.

But this is nothing new.	Mana nke a abụghị ihe ọhụrụ.

We read every day.	Anyị na-agụ akwụkwọ kwa ụbọchị.
My daughter is studying to become a doctor.	Nwa m nwanyị na-agụ akwụkwọ ka ọ bụrụ dọkịta.
But this does not always happen.	Mana nke a anaghị eme mgbe niile.

Now he understands.	Ugbu a ọ ghọtara.
Can't use it.	Enweghị ike iji ya.
He had a hypocritical plan.	Ọ nwere atụmatụ ihu abụọ.
He expected it to stop.	Ọ tụrụ anya na ọ kwụsịrị.
Many years.	Ọtụtụ afọ.
It's awesome.	Ọ bụ ihe dị egwu.

If it does, we should not do anything.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ ga-eme, anyị ekwesịghị ime ihe ọ bụla.
I do not need to say anything else.	Adịghị m mkpa ikwu ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.
You love sports so much.	Ị hụrụ egwuregwu n'anya nke ukwuu.
The problem is time and energy are important.	Nsogbu bụ oge na ike dị mkpa.
That is the man who gave you the bill.	Nke ahụ bụ nwoke ahụ nyere gị akwụkwọ ego ahụ.
Sometimes it is not wrong.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ dịghị njọ.
It seems like a big problem.	Ọ dị ka nnukwu nsogbu.

It will never happen.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-eme.
You can see it in his hand.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ya n'aka ya.
Police want more information about this case.	Ndị uwe ojii chọrọ ozi ndị ọzọ gbasara ikpe a.
He will never use more power.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-eji ike ọzọ.
How is the weather?	Kedu ka ihu igwe dị?
It's a bad picture.	Ọ bụ foto na-adịghị mma.
He said it was legal now.	O kwuru na ọ bụ iwu ugbu a.
In this way, the people.	N'ụzọ dị otú a, ndị.
There is no cooking.	Enweghị isi nri.
Although the houses were small, they had a room inside.	N'agbanyeghị na ụlọ ndị ahụ dị obere, ha nwere ọnụ ụlọ n'ime.
I was terrified.	Ụjọ juru m.
I do not feel good about myself.	Adịghị m mma n'ime onwe m.
The meeting was pointless.	Nzukọ ahụ enweghị isi.
He wants to see you.	Ọ chọrọ ịhụ gị.
You should call me the worst.	Ị kwesịrị ịkpọ m ihe kacha njọ.
This could have happened to me.	Nke a gaara eme m.
New money and old hands.	Ego ọhụrụ na aka ochie.
Our store was robbed last night.	E zuru ụlọ ahịa anyị n'abalị ụnyahụ.
She has a child of her own.	O nwere nwa nke ya.
We can do whatever we want here.	Anyị nwere ike ime ihe ọ bụla anyị chọrọ ebe a.

Good and good.	Mma na mma.
Again, again, he said.	Ọzọ, ọzọ, ka o kwuru.

But it was not a difficult task for me.	Ma ọ bụghị ọrụ siri ike nye m.
However, it is not dead heat.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị okpomọkụ nwụrụ anwụ.
Love this city.	Hụrụ obodo a n'anya.

One way or another, they have problems.	Otu ụzọ ma ọ bụ n'ụzọ ọzọ, ha nwere nsogbu.
He eventually became friends with her.	Ya na ya mechara bụrụ enyi.
Strong thinking is a thing of the past.	Echiche siri ike bụ ihe gara aga.
It fits well.	Ọ dara nke ọma.
I think we would have seen it come.	Echere m na anyị gaara ahụ ka ọ na-abịa.
I'll tell you about it back then.	Aga m agwa gị maka ya n'ụzọ ịla azụ.
That way you will know it is the best.	Otú ahụ ka ị ga-esi mara na ọ kacha mma.
However, there is no problem.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị enwe nsogbu.
But we need a new job one at a time.	Mana anyị chọrọ ọrụ ọhụrụ otu oge n'oge.
He needed strong help.	Enyemaka siri ike dị ya mkpa.
No one is wise, no one is seeing it.	Ọ dịghị onye maara ihe, ọ dịghị onye hụrụ ya.
That quickly stopped.	Nke ahụ kwụsịrị ngwa ngwa.
Let's continue on to this water.	Ka anyị gaa n'ihu n'ihu mmiri a.
Thanks for the special friends you are.	Daalụ maka ndị enyi pụrụ iche ị bụ.

Many cars are still in operation.	Ọtụtụ ụgbọ ala ka na-arụ ọrụ.
They are very useful.	Ha bara oke uru.
The money is still only on paper.	Ego ahụ ka dị naanị na akwụkwọ.
He made a fundamental point.	O kwuru ihe bụ́ isi.
Work, he said.	Ọrụ, o kwuru.
I need money anyway.	Achọrọ m ego n'ụzọ ọ bụla.
The doctor gave her powerful medicines.	Dọkịta ahụ nyere ya ọgwụ ndị dị ike.
They were trying.	Ha nọ na-agbalị.
Or go away again.	Ma ọ bụ pụọ ọzọ.
Past and present.	Oge gara aga na ugbu a.
That is not, of course, what happened.	Nke ahụ abụghị, n'ezie, ihe merenụ.
In the village, there is a good restaurant.	N'ime obodo, e nwere ezigbo ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
You are loved and sought and sought.	A hụrụ gị n'anya ma chọọ ma chọọ.
However, not at the same time.	Otú ọ dị, ọ bụghị n'otu oge ahụ.
Time does not work as you expected.	Oge anaghị arụ ọrụ ka ị chere.
I left the water where it was.	M hapụrụ mmiri ahụ ebe ọ dị.
Little bug.	Obere ahụhụ.
Everyone has a good friend.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ezigbo enyi.
Certainly not his father.	N'ezie ọ bụghị nna ya.
He knows his way around.	Ọ maara ụzọ ya gburugburu.
They have the best team.	Ha nwere otu kacha mma.
But you can do something about that.	Ma ị nwere ike ime ihe banyere nke ahụ.
That is the only word.	Nke ahụ bụ naanị okwu ahụ.
And what a man he is.	Na ihe nwoke ọ bụ.
Now it has happened.	Ugbu a, o mere.
Still, there are limitations.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, e nwere ókè.
Just stay that way.	Naanị nọrọ otu ahụ.
Another round, too.	Onye ọzọ gbara gburugburu, kwa.
He looked at her.	O lere ya anya.
The woman lives near the house.	Nwanyị ahụ bi n'akụkụ ụlọ.
Most of them will never do another movie again.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha agaghị eme ihe nkiri ọzọ ọzọ.
There are so many places.	E nwere ọtụtụ ebe ahụ.
You can be something else.	Ị nwere ike ịbụ ihe ọzọ.
But that is not what happened in the past.	Mana nke ahụ abụghị ihe mere n’oge gara aga.
From my people.	Site na ndị m.
But she is unhappy.	Ma obi adịghị ya mma.
He looked.	O lere anya.
Here are some quick ideas.	Nke ahụ bụ ụfọdụ echiche ngwa ngwa.
But in practice, this does not happen.	Ma na omume, nke a adịghị eme.
Some monsters are pets, some are not.	Ụfọdụ nnukwu anụ bụ anụ ụlọ, ụfọdụ adịghị.
It is still ongoing.	Ọ ka na-aga n'ihu.
He didn't really have a language.	O nweghị asụsụ n'ezie.
We play.	Anyị na-egwu egwu.
There is nothing like it.	Ọ nweghị ihe dị ka ya.
No one was home during the fire.	Ọ dịghị onye nọ n'ụlọ n'oge ọkụ ahụ.
Talking to her is like talking to each other.	Ịgwa ya okwu dị ka ịgwa onye ọ bụla ọzọ okwu.
The meeting was empty.	Nzukọ ahụ enweghị ihe ọ bụla.
Yesterday, my eyes looked at the girl there.	Ụnyaahụ, anya m lere nwa agbọghọ ahụ nọ ebe ahụ.
We may not know.	Anyị nwere ike ọ gaghị ama.
What is the nearest.	Kedu ihe kacha nso.
Again, none of these things are new.	Ọzọ, ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a bụ ihe ọhụrụ.
This is a surprising question.	Ajụjụ a tụrụ ya n'anya.
I'm not sure if this will help you.	Ejighị m n'aka ma nke a ga-enyere gị aka.
They go every day at the same time.	Ha na-aga kwa ụbọchị n'otu oge.
Everyone has a different and unique situation.	Onye ọ bụla nwere ọnọdụ dị iche na nke pụrụ iche.
I was in that situation myself.	Anọ m na ọnọdụ ahụ n'onwe m.
I think it was at his house.	Echere m na ọ bụ n'ụlọ ya.
This comes in handy.	Nke a na-abịa nke siri ike.
But there are limits.	Ma enwere oke.
It did a lot of people.	O mere ọtụtụ mmadụ.
Now tell me about your newspaper.	Ugbu a gwa m gbasara akwụkwọ akụkọ gị.
I looked at them.	M lere ha anya.
There is no way.	Enweghị ụzọ ọ bụla.
Many homes of their own.	Ọtụtụ ụlọ nke ha.
Eat only when you are hungry.	Na-eri naanị mgbe agụụ na-agụ gị.
But it is not a question.	Ma ọ bụghị ajụjụ.
I like mine.	Nke m masịrị m.

There are not many people of color.	Enweghị ọtụtụ ndị nwere agba.
I think that is it.	Echere m na ọ bụ ihe ahụ.
Do it well this time.	Mee ya nke ọma oge a.
We started talking.	Anyị malitere ikwu okwu.
Like, every day.	Dị ka, ụbọchị ọ bụla.
He looked at it carefully.	O lere ya anya nke ọma.
These are my two plans.	Ndị a bụ atụmatụ m abụọ.
The weather is bad.	Ihu igwe adịghị mma.
That will be a great day, that will be a great tomorrow.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ nnukwu ụbọchị, nke ahụ ga-abụ nnukwu echi.
However, there are several weaknesses.	Otú ọ dị, e nwere ọtụtụ adịghị ike.
All of this happened within a month.	Ihe a niile mere n'ime ọnwa.
Maybe something will happen.	Ma eleghị anya, ihe ga-eme.
And seeing them.	Na ịhụ ha.
And everything happened for a reason.	Na ihe niile mere maka ihe kpatara ya.
My grandmother.	Nne nne m.
Mom has her big ball.	Nne na-enwe nnukwu bọọlụ ya.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	O yikarịrị ka ọ bụ n'ihi egwu.
They are more likely to be judges.	O yikarịrị ka ha ga-abụ ndị ikpe.
That is very good.	Nke ahụ dị oke mma.
I do not know where I am going.	Amaghị ebe m na-aga adịghị mma.
Very different, of course.	Dị nnọọ iche, n'ezie.
He began to feel violent.	Ọ malitere inwe mmetụta ime ihe ike.
My employer has spoken to them over the years.	Onye ọrụ m gwara ha okwu n'ime afọ ndị a.
The customer promised him the best.	Onye ahịa ahụ kwere ya nkwa kacha mma.
No one is there for you.	O nweghị onye nọ ebe ị chọrọ ya.
We want a company that will do well.	Anyị chọrọ ụlọ ọrụ ga-eme nke ọma.
I know the truth.	Amaara m eziokwu.
Please do that yourself next time.	Biko mee nke ahụ n'onwe gị oge ọzọ.
Tell us when we are coming.	Gwa anyị mgbe anyị ga-abịa.
Most of us have a laid back attitude when it comes to painting a picture about ourselves.	Ọtụtụ n'ime anyị amaghị maka oke na mmetụta ya.
No one did.	Ọ dịghị onye mere.
Few for housework.	Ole na ole maka ọrụ ụlọ.
I hope this girl will do the same.	Enwere m olileanya na nwa agbọghọ a ga-eme otu ihe ahụ.
But no one really knows what to do.	Ma ọ dịghị onye ma ihe ọ ga-eme.
Now we are here.	Ugbu a, anyị nọ ebe a.
But obviously there are some who do not.	Ma o doro anya na e nwere ụfọdụ ndị na-adịghị.
Not so close.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ nso.
If they want me.	Ọ bụrụ na ha chọrọ m.
We all can't.	Anyị niile enweghị ike.
He looked at me back.	O lere m anya azụ.
You have to make it see that.	Ị ga-eme ka ọ hụ nke ahụ.
At your disposal.	Na ibu ọrụ gị.
Behind is the case.	N'azụ bụ ikpe.
But he didn't really like it.	Ma o nweghị mmasị n'ezie.
In height and age.	Na elu na afọ.
Your book is beautiful.	Akwụkwọ gị mara mma.
He looked at her hand then in his eyes.	O lere aka ya anya mgbe ahụ n'anya ya.
My sister arrived tonight.	Nwanne m nwanyị rutere n'abalị a.
No one can love it.	Ọ dịghị onye pụrụ ịhụ ya n'anya.
This is something you have to do right away.	Nke a bụ ihe ị ga-eme ozugbo.
He looked at it all his life.	O lere ya anya ná ndụ ya niile.
This case is going well.	Ikpe a na-aga nke ọma.
Everything the man said was a lie.	Ihe niile nwoke ahụ kwuru bụ ụgha.
I feel this is not good.	Enwere m mmetụta nke a adịghị mma.
Life is not good.	Ndụ adịghị mma.
Few people have money, but many do not.	Mmadụ ole na ole nwere ego, ma ọtụtụ enweghị.
One year from now we will have a new car.	Otu afọ site ugbu a anyị ga-enwe ụgbọ ala ọhụrụ.
I plan not to go on vacation again.	M na-eme atụmatụ na agaghị m aga ezumike ọzọ.
It is very simple and delicious.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe ma dị ụtọ.
Why do you know?	Gịnị mere ị ga-eji mara?
I was in them almost all day.	Anọ m n'ime ha ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ụbọchị niile.
Go girl strong.	Gaa nwa agbọghọ ike.
If anything, that is.	Ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla doro anya, nke ahụ bụ.
I spent a week there, four summer ago.	M nọrọ otu izu ebe ahụ, n'oge okpomọkụ anọ gara aga.
There are a few ways to do this.	Enwere ụzọ ole na ole iji mee nke a.
Not that he needed it.	Ọ bụghị na ọ dị ya mkpa.
The reason is not clear at first glance.	Na ihe mere na-adịghị doro anya na mbụ anya.
When there is a problem, the police come quickly.	Mgbe enwere nsogbu, ndị uwe ojii na-abịa ngwa ngwa.
My son has a good heart.	Nwa m nwoke nwere ezigbo obi.
Just let me know if you are interested.	Naanị mee ka m mara ma ị nwere mmasị.
It would be awesome.	Ọ ga-adị oke egwu.
Nothing special until then.	Ọ dịghị ihe pụrụ iche ruo mgbe ahụ.
The man came to the city looking for work.	Nwoke ahụ bịara obodo na-achọ ọrụ.
The meeting should last for two days.	Nzukọ ahụ kwesịrị ịdị ụbọchị abụọ.
This is the reason.	Nke a bụ ihe kpatara ya.
Many students eat lunch.	Ọtụtụ ụmụ akwụkwọ na-eri nri nri ehihie.
People like new things.	Ihe ọhụrụ na-amasị ndị mmadụ.
We need some information about this city.	Anyị chọrọ ụfọdụ ozi gbasara obodo a.
It’s always a joke.	Ọ bụ ihe egwuregwu mgbe niile.
Not just for me.	Ọ bụghị naanị maka m.
And now, this one.	Ma ugbu a, nke a.
Otherwise.	Ma ọ bụghị .
What can be done will help them.	Ihe e nwere ike ime ga-enyere ha aka.
All because of one boy.	Ihe niile n'ihi otu nwata nwoke.
If in doubt, know that.	Ọ bụrụ na enwere obi abụọ, mara nke ahụ.
I could not find the story.	Enweghị m ike ịchọta akụkọ ahụ.
So in another word.	Ya mere na okwu ọzọ.
It will be nice to see you again.	Ọ ga-adị mma ịhụ gị ọzọ.
Two things are inside.	Ihe abụọ dị n'ime.
Of food on one trip.	Nke nri na otu njem.
Like others.	Dị ka ndị ọzọ.
And why people do it.	Na ihe mere ndị mmadụ ji eme ya.
The man asked a similar question.	Nwoke ahụ yiri ajụjụ ahụ ọ masịrị ya.
No work is immediately reported.	Enweghị ọrụ ọ bụla a na-ekwu ozugbo.
She cares about her children.	Ọ na-eche banyere ụmụ ya.
But you can do them.	Ma ị nwere ike ime ha.
I know it will be so.	Amaara m na ọ ga-adị otú ahụ.
I will do something from here onwards from now on.	Aga m eme ihe site ebe a site ugbu a gaa n'ihu.
My father had many plans.	Nna m nwere ọtụtụ atụmatụ.
We are still working on it.	Anyị ka na-arụ ọrụ ya.
We had a great time.	Anyị nwere ezigbo oge.
She has three children from three different fathers.	O nwere ụmụ atọ site na nna atọ dị iche iche.
The longer the length, the better.	Ogologo ogologo, ka mma.
There are a few books.	E nwere akwụkwọ ole na ole.
Both of us were sick.	Ọrịa anyị abụọ tụrụ egwu.
The people in the room looked at each other.	Ndị nọ n'ime ụlọ ahụ lere ibe ha anya.
He looked inside for the reason for his actions.	O lere anya n'ime maka ihe kpatara omume ya.
Certainly not you.	O doro anya na ọ bụghị gị.
We still need your help.	Anyị ka chọrọ enyemaka gị.
This is good news and bad news.	Nke a bụ ozi ọma na akụkọ ọjọọ.
It would be logical.	Ọ ga-abụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Eji m n'aka na ọ ga-adị mma.
I hear him playing and all is well.	Ana m anụ ka ọ na-egwu egwu na ihe niile dị mma.
But everything else seems to be good news.	Ma ihe ọ bụla ọzọ yiri ka ọ bụ ozi ọma.
It makes us who we are.	Ọ na-eme ka anyị bụrụ ndị anyị bụ.
He does it wherever he looks.	Ọ na-eme ebe ọ bụla o lere anya.
You are not really angry.	Iwe adịghị gị n'ezie.
He knows how to wait and how to rest.	Ọ maara otú e si echere na ka ọ ga-esi zuru ike.
They failed their mission.	Ha dara ozi ha.
It is a strong case.	Ọ bụ ikpe siri ike.
I am sure he will do it.	Eji m n'aka na ọ ga-eme ya.
Apparently the speaker was upset.	O doro anya na onye na-ekwu okwu were iwe.
Undoubtedly, different people have different approaches to this.	Obi abụọ adịghị ya, ndị dị iche iche nwere ụzọ dị iche iche maka nke a.
Church is on the right.	Ụka dị n'aka nri.
But he was only a handsome man, a good man.	Mana ọ bụ naanị nwoke mara mma, ezigbo nwoke.
Get yourself around here in the next ten minutes.	Gaa onwe gị gburugburu ebe a n'ime nkeji iri na-abịa.
I am a fool.	Enwere m onye nzuzu.
If it's okay.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mma.
It is very cold here.	Ọ dị ezigbo oyi ebe a.
They looked at that moment.	Ha lere anya n'oge ahụ.
I use this example.	Ana m eji ihe atụ a.
Suppose we are on the same page.	Chere na anyị nọ n'otu ibe ahụ.
So we did.	Ya mere, anyị mere.
Some people are willing to give a little.	Ụfọdụ ndị dị njikere inye obere ihe.
I have a prison.	Enwere ụlọ mkpọrọ m.

He took it all.	O were ya niile.
He may still feel rejected.	Ọ ka nwere ike na-eche na a jụrụ ya.
I know my community service.	Amaara m ọrụ obodo m.
It immediately came to our attention.	Ọ bịara ozugbo n'isi anyị.
However, that was no reason to steal the baby.	Otú ọ dị, nke ahụ abụghị ihe mere a ga-eji zuru nwa ọhụrụ ahụ.
But it doesn't seem to be working.	Mana ọ dị ka ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
Travelers will not survive if travelers do not survive.	Ndị na-eme njem agaghị adị ndụ ma ọ bụrụ na ndị na-eme njem anaghị adị ndụ.
You can be one of them.	Ị nwere ike ịbụ otu n'ime ha.
You deserve the same.	Ị kwesịrị otu ihe ahụ.
Things started to go as bad as they could.	Ihe malitere ịdị njọ otú ha nwere ike.
I like it.	Ọ dị m mma.
No one was there.	O nweghị onye nọ ebe ahụ.
He was young for his age.	Ọ bụ nwata maka afọ ndụ ya.
He tries, in his own way, to make them special.	Ọ na-agbalị, n'ụzọ ya, ime ka ọ pụrụ iche maka ha.
The car was stolen.	E zuru ụgbọala ahụ.
To do it.	Iji mee ya.
Everything around him was perfect.	Ihe niile gbara ya gburugburu zuru oke.
My friend thought he was someone else.	Enyi m chere na ọ bụ onye ọzọ.
But there are many things.	Ma enwere ọtụtụ ihe.
It is not like we are in our day.	Ọ dịghị ka anyị dị n'oge anyị.
Drugs are bad!	Ọgwụ ọjọọ adịghị mma!
Somehow, they both saw it.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ha abụọ hụrụ ya.
You do not know your place.	Ị maghị ebe gị.
I think mine is similar.	Echere m na nke m yiri.
It didn't matter.	O nweghị nke o mere.
You yourself told me that.	Gị onwe gị gwara m otú ahụ.
It happens every day.	Ọ na-eme kwa ụbọchị.
We will do better than this.	Anyị ga-eme nke ọma karịa nke a.
My dear children, what are you going to do?	Ụmụ m m hụrụ n'anya, gịnị ka unu ga-eme?
He made them fools.	O mere ka ha bụrụ ndị nzuzu.
His words are interesting.	Okwu ya nwere mmasị.
This city is beautiful.	Obodo a mara mma.
Tell him about his life.	Gwa ya banyere ndụ ya.
He can do that in a variety of ways.	Ọ nwere ike ime nke ahụ n'ụzọ dị iche iche.
No matter what you expect of us.	N'agbanyeghị ihe ị na-atụ anyị.
I will do my job, even though you will not do yours.	Aga m arụ ọrụ m, n'agbanyeghị na ị gaghị eme nke gị.
My people are here.	Ndị m nọ ebe a.
We should be reluctant.	Anyị kwesịrị ịla azụ.
Other bad things, too.	Ihe ọjọọ ndị ọzọ, kwa.
All the players are new players for me.	Ndị egwuregwu niile bụ ndị egwuregwu ọhụrụ maka m.
Psychological history.	Akụkọ nke uche.
He said it would not happen to me.	O kwuru na ọ gaghị eme m.
The same medication can have many side effects.	Otu ọgwụ ahụ nwere ike inwe ọtụtụ mmetụta.
They want his life.	Ha chọrọ ndụ ya.
His short life is not known.	A maghị obere ndụ ya.
Small town.	Obere obodo.
His outburst surprised me.	Iwe ya na mberede tụrụ m n’anya.
However, side effects do occur.	Otú ọ dị, mmetụta dị n'akụkụ na-eme.
He reads at night.	Ọ na-agụ ihe n'ime abalị.
There has been no impact so far.	Enweghị mmetụta ọ bụla ruo ugbu a.
It's useless.	O nweghị isi.
He saw her try to move on again, but again she fell.	Ọ hụrụ ka ọ na-agbalị ịga n'ihu ọzọ, ma ọzọ ọ dara.
I know it's not huge.	Ama m na ọ bụghị nnukwu.
You can use it for whatever you want.	Ị nwere ike iji ya mee ihe ị chọrọ.
But our value is real.	Mana ọnụ ahịa anyị dị adị.
A few days maybe.	Ụbọchị ole na ole eleghị anya.
They do not love me.	Ha ahụghị m n'anya.
We want to do this.	Anyị chọrọ ime ihe a.
That he wanted it as he wanted it.	Na ọ chọrọ ya dị ka ọ chọrọ ya.
But at the same time kind of nice.	Ma n'otu oge ahụ ụdị mma.
At the same time nothing is the same.	N'otu oge ahụ ọ dịghị ihe bụ otu.
This was not his plan for his life.	Nke a abụghị atụmatụ ya maka ndụ ya.
There were a few people there, a few dogs.	Enwere mmadụ ole na ole n'ebe ahụ, nkịta ole na ole.
The trip was very bad.	Njem ahụ dị njọ nke ukwuu.
I do not know very well.	Amaghị m nke ọma.

There is work to be done now.	Enwere ọrụ ime ugbu a.
No one has a name.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere aha.

You can not go home.	Ị gaghị aga ụlọ.

I have a good job.	Enwere m ezigbo ọrụ.
We take steps to prevent it.	Anyị na-eme ihe iji ghara ịla azụ.
The big advantage of this is that it is longer.	Nnukwu uru nke a bụ na ọ dị ogologo.
The people there are doing something.	Ndị bi n'ebe ahụ na-eme ihe.
But that is not how it happened.	Ma ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka o siri mee.
That is not the reason.	Ọ bụghị ya kpatara ya.
They looked into the tree.	Ha lere anya n'ime osisi ahụ.
He knew for the first time.	Ọ maara na nke mbụ ya.
He knew very well, and told him a little.	Ọ ma nke ukwuu, ma gwa ya obere ihe.
It is the way of life here.	Ọ bụ ụzọ ndụ ebe a.
It's clear.	O doro anya.
You can get all the companies in trouble.	Ị nwere ike nweta ụlọ ọrụ niile na nsogbu.
They were looking for something new.	Ha nọ na-achọ ihe ọhụrụ.

He would do nothing if he did.	Ọ gaghị eme ihe ọ bụla ma ọ bụrụ na ọ mere.
Where it will go and it will do well.	Ebe ọ ga-aga ma ọ na-eme nke ọma.
Now we can see how that works.	Ugbu a, anyị nwere ike ịhụ ka nke ahụ si arụ ọrụ.
This is where the real problem lies.	Nke a bụ ebe ezigbo nsogbu dị.
I need the money well.	Achọrọ m ego ahụ nke ọma.
They were amazed at the thought.	Echiche ahụ tụrụ ha n'anya.
It could not be easier.	Enweghị ike ịdị mfe.
He is not a customer.	Ọ bụghị onye ahịa.
That's what he says.	Ọ bụ ya ka ọ na-ekwu.
But this is very different.	Ma nke a dị nnọọ iche.
He got that in the first week.	O nwetara nke ahụ n'izu mbụ.
You know they can't believe it.	Ị ma na ha enweghị ike ikweta.
Of course, every month.	N'ezie, kwa ọnwa.
But sometimes boys are girls.	Ma mgbe ụfọdụ, ụmụ nwoke ga-abụ ụmụ agbọghọ.
Yesterday was the first.	Abalị ụnyahụ bụ nke mbụ.
There are so many things you like.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe na-amasị gị.
We do not know what to do.	Anyị amaghị ihe anyị ga-eme.
Children have little to do.	Ụmụaka nwere obere ọrụ ha na-arụ.
Probably for the best use a few days.	Eleghị anya maka ihe kacha mma iji ụbọchị ole na ole.
His children hate him.	Ụmụ ya kpọrọ ya asị.
We saw everything the ship had to offer.	Anyị hụrụ ihe niile ụgbọ mmiri ahụ nwere inye.
Negative thoughts.	Echiche ọjọọ.
I need them at home.	Achọrọ m ha n'ụlọ.
They promised to help us.	Ha kwere anyị nkwa na ha ga-enyere anyị aka.
I walked out of it several times, saying it was impossible.	M si na ya pụọ ​​ọtụtụ oge, na-ekwu na ọ gaghị ekwe omume.
For that matter, it's easy.	N'akụkụ ahụ, ọ dị mfe.
You expect a little more than that.	Ị na-atụ anya ntakịrị karịa nke ahụ.
Probably not a good idea right now thinking about it.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị ezigbo echiche ugbu a na-eche banyere ya.
Her son is still young to go to school.	Nwa ya nwoke ka dị obere ịga akwụkwọ.
Of course, they love different ways.	N'ezie, ha hụrụ ụzọ dị iche iche n'anya.
He left us all.	Ọ hapụrụ anyị niile.
Not as bad as it would have been.	Ọ bụghị dị njọ dị ka ọ gaara adị.
I really feel that way.	Enwere m mmetụta dị otú ahụ n'ezie.
Something is going wrong.	Ọ nwere ihe na-aga adịghị mma.
I do not know what the moon is.	Amaghị ihe ọnwa ọ bụ.
But this does not work.	Mana nke a anaghị arụ ọrụ.
He was a good man.	Ọ bụ ezigbo mmadụ.
Probably not good.	Eleghị anya ọ dịghị mma.
It is very close.	Ọ dị ezigbo nso.
I know this is not a message for many.	Ama m na nke a abụghị ozi nye ọtụtụ.
But most of them do not know.	Ma ha amaghị ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
He was saying something that was clear.	Ọ nọ na-ekwu ihe doro anya.
I will have a conversation with them.	Mụ na ha ga-enwe okwu.
She really needs to go to school.	O kwesịrị ịga akwụkwọ n'ezie.
Then a few more.	Mgbe ahụ ole na ole ọzọ.
But that is just one word.	Ma nke ahụ bụ naanị otu okwu.
But many did.	Ma ọtụtụ ndị mere ya.
I am happy to do so.	Obi dị m ụtọ ime otú ahụ.
He entered the house and went to his office.	Ọ banyere n'ụlọ ahụ wee gaa n'ụlọ ọrụ ya.
So he knew what the game plan was.	Ya mere ọ maara ihe atụmatụ egwuregwu ahụ bụ.
We can talk about anything.	Anyị nwere ike ikwu banyere ihe ọ bụla.
My four-year-old son and I were traveling.	Mụ na nwa m nwoke, onye dị afọ anọ nọ na-eme njem.
I saw that right away.	Ahụrụ m nke ahụ ozugbo.
I do not understand what is happening.	Aghọtaghị m ihe na-eme.
Most of the staff there are girls.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị ọrụ ebe ahụ bụ ụmụ agbọghọ.
We will go fast.	Anyị ga-aga ngwa ngwa.
Let me give you a few more examples.	Ka m nye gị ihe atụ ole na ole ndị ọzọ.
No one can doubt that.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike inwe obi abụọ na nke ahụ.
The man's eyes.	Anya nwoke.
But that is our message.	Ma nke ahụ bụ ozi anyị.
He was 33 years old.	Ọ gbara afọ iri atọ na atọ.
One eye told me the worst.	Otu anya gwara m nke kacha njọ.
We had lunch there.	Anyị nwetara nri ehihie ebe ahụ.
It’s kind of stupid, that’s what it is.	Ọ bụ ụdị nzuzu, nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ bụ.
They stole it.	Ha zuru ya ego.
That was almost a year ago.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ otu afọ gara aga.
I am not afraid of anything.	Anaghị m atụ egwu ihe ọ bụla.
Not just for work, but for everything.	Ọ bụghị naanị maka ọrụ, mana maka ihe niile.
It is happening now.	Ọ na-eme ugbu a.
I like new things.	Ihe ọhụrụ na-amasị m.
I spoke to you that day.	Agwara m gị okwu ụbọchị ahụ.
The point here is another.	Isi okwu ebe a bụ ihe ọzọ.
Give sailors speed not only to run.	Nye ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri ọsọ ka ọ bụghị naanị na ha na-agba ọsọ.
What’s behind this door?	Kedu ihe dị n'azụ ọnụ ụzọ a?
We spent a lot of time looking for the house.	Anyị nọrọ ogologo oge na-achọ ụlọ ahụ.
There is no place to run.	Enweghị ebe ịgba ọsọ.
In effect.	Na mmetụta.
One way needed.	Otu ụzọ mkpa.
How they do it.	Otú ha si eme ya.
Ask him to leave.	Gwa ya ka ọ pụọ.
The effect is the same.	Mmetụta ahụ bụ otu mgbe.
I do not want it.	Achọghị m ya.
You are very pretty.	Ị mara oke mma.
There are many rooms.	Enwere ọtụtụ ime ụlọ.
Not at all.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ ma ọlị.
Anyway, he left us this thing.	Nke ọ bụla, ọ hapụrụ anyị ihe a.
Things can get out of hand easily.	Ihe nwere ike ịpụ n'ụzọ dị mfe.
Their whole city was set on fire.	A gbara obodo ha niile ọkụ.
Did you get involved in the project?	Ị tinyere aka na ọrụ ahụ?
Everything felt foreign.	Ihe niile chere na mba ọzọ na-atụ egwu.
We are strong.	Anyị bụ ike.
Probably not his style.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụghị ụdị oriri ya.
I want to know if it will be good.	Achọrọ m ịma na ọ ga-adị mma.
They left about four.	Ha hapụrụ ihe dị ka anọ.
The song has no music.	Egwu ahụ enweghị egwu ọ bụla.
Or anywhere near you.	Ma ọ bụ ebe ọ bụla dị gị nso.
And again, and again.	Na ọzọ, na ọzọ.
He wants everyone, everything to be happy.	Ọ chọrọ ka onye ọ bụla, ihe niile na-enwe obi ụtọ.
Everyone tried to move on.	Onye ọ bụla gbalịrị ịga n'ihu.
Customers are not important.	Ndị ahịa adịghị mkpa.
Just a hard thing.	Naanị ihe siri ike.
At first he was satisfied.	Na mbụ afọ juru ya afọ.
Everything is working now.	Ihe niile na-arụ ọrụ ugbu a.
What a joke.	Kedu ihe ọchị.
There is something wrong with the skin.	Ọ nwere ihe adịghị mma na akpụkpọ ahụ.
No one wants that in their lives.	Ọ dịghị onye chọrọ nke ahụ na ndụ ha.
There is no benefit in this.	Ọ dịghị uru na nke a.
We need a new playground for children.	Anyị chọrọ ebe egwuregwu ọhụrụ maka ụmụaka.
It’s just a movie.	Ọ bụ nnọọ ihe nkiri.
So maybe.	Ya mere, eleghị anya.
Someone will help with the housework.	Mmadụ ga-enyere aka n'ọrụ ụlọ.
But it is far from over.	Ma ọ dị anya site na ibe.
We were not here until we died.	Anyị anọghị ebe a ruo mgbe anyị nwụrụ.
I do not understand again.	Aghọtaghị m ọzọ.
There is only space ahead of me.	Enwere naanị ohere dị n'ihu m.
But now he is about to leave.	Ma ugbu a ọ na-achọ ịla.
I have a way to go.	Enwere m ụzọ m ga-esi gaa.
I just did.	M ka mere.
Which is your favorite?	Kedu nke kacha amasị gị?
Three more years.	Afọ atọ ọzọ.
Should do.	Kwesịrị ime.
His age could not be stated.	Apụghị ikwu afọ ndụ ya.
It's very simple.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe.
Your own person,	Onye nke gị,
Every moment of his life.	Oge ọ bụla nke ndụ ya.
This took several months.	Nke a were ọtụtụ ọnwa.
First story back.	Mbụ akụkọ azụ.
In the next life.	Na ndụ ọzọ.
We really have.	Anyị nwere n'ezie.
But then so it was with her father.	Ma mgbe ahụ, otú ahụ ka nna ya dị.
Nothing is as it used to be.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị ka ọ dị na mbụ.
It is a beautiful car in itself.	Ọ bụ ụgbọ ala mara mma n'onwe ya.
There could be several reasons for this.	Enwere ike inwe ọtụtụ ihe kpatara nke a.
Not good.	Adịghị mma.
Can't call you again.	Enweghị ike ịkpọ gị ọzọ.
But we can never know for sure.	Ma anyị enweghị ike ịma nke ọma.
I want to be one.	Achọrọ m ịbụ onye.
Talk to the spirit.	Gwa mmụọ ihe.
He could see his mother eating dinner.	O nwere ike ịhụ nne ya ka ọ na-eri nri abalị.
But only if you focus your work on me.	Mana naanị ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-eche ọrụ gị n'ebe m nọ.
You stay home.	Ị nọrọ n'ụlọ.
The work was hard.	Ọrụ ahụ siri ike.
It may not be the last.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ nke ikpeazụ.
I did not see him coming.	Ahụghị m ka ọ na-abịa.
We are a market.	Anyị bụ ahịa.
Now is my chance.	Ugbu a bụ ohere m.
I don't like any of them.	Ọ dịghị nke na-amasị m.
Not water.	Ọ bụghị mmiri.
First time, last time.	Oge mbụ, oge ikpeazụ.
Or they are still.	Ma ọ bụ ha ka.
It is for pregnancy.	Ọ bụ maka ime.
Love is easy.	Ịhụ egwu n'anya dị mfe.
Of course, that is not the case.	N'ezie, nke ahụ abụghị ụdị ya.
However, this is only a plan.	Otú ọ dị, nke a bụ naanị atụmatụ.
Not very tasty.	Adịghị ụtọ nke ukwuu.
He knew he had no chance.	Ọ maara na ọ naghị enwe ohere.
It's bad.	Ọ dị njọ.
He does things only on his own time.	Ọ na-eme naanị ihe nke ya n'oge nke ya.
Obviously that is the next step.	O doro anya na nke ahụ bụ ihe ọzọ a ga-eme.
That they are high by the players.	Na ha dị elu site na ndị egwuregwu.
I have a big problem with that.	Enwere m nnukwu nsogbu na nke ahụ.
This can only be done once in a game.	Enwere ike ime nke a naanị otu ugboro na egwuregwu.
That it works for me.	Na ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka m.
Really loved it.	N'ezie hụrụ ya n'anya.
Do whatever you have to do.	Mee ihe ọ bụla ị ga-eme.
The challenge now is to find the trees.	Ihe isi ike ugbu a bụ ịchọta osisi.
I don't know anyone who did that again.	Amaghị onye ọ bụla mere nke ahụ ọzọ.
It's not fast.	Ọ dịghị ngwa ngwa.
He just could go out.	Ọ pụrụ nnọọ pụọ.
Not the way like the others.	Ọ bụghị ụzọ dị ka ndị ọzọ.
His opinion is good.	Echiche ya dị mma.
I don’t want you to think about me.	Achọghị m ka ị na-eche banyere m.
None of them exist.	Ọ dịghị otu n'ime ha ka ọ dị adị.
The only question is when to look.	Naanị ajụjụ bụ mgbe anya.
This case is unique.	Ikpe a pụrụ iche.
He has a house.	O nwere ụlọ.
It is because of what you do.	Ọ bụ maka ihe ị na-eme.
It is not good for humans.	Ọ dịghị mma na ụmụ mmadụ.
Maybe it’s a little important, but it has a chance.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ dị ntakịrị mkpa, ma o nwere ohere.
It's just me.	Ọ bụ naanị m.
That is very new.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ ihe ọhụrụ.
I don’t know if it’s still there.	Amaghị m ma ọ ka dị ebe ahụ.
So he does it with everyone else.	Ya mere ọ na-eme ya na onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
I was just playing live.	Naanị m na-egwu ndụ.
It looks like you got a really good one.	Ọ dị ka ị nwetara ezigbo nke ọma.
He asked what else was there.	Ọ jụrụ ihe ọzọ dị.
He thought that was fun.	O chere na nke ahụ bụ ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
But almost.	Mana ọ fọrọ obere ka ọ bụrụ.
It is a false message.	Ọ bụ ozi ụgha.
You would not know if it has any.	Ị gaghị ama na o nwere nke ọ bụla.
We do a lot of things together.	Anyị na-eme ọtụtụ ihe ọnụ.
But never up from this side.	Ma ọ dịghị mgbe elu si n'akụkụ a.
We are violent.	Anyị na-eme ihe ike.
This is the best time for work.	Nke a bụ oge kacha mma maka ọrụ.
The worst is yet to come.	Nke kacha njọ ka ga-abịa.
There was nothing that he could do.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ọ pụrụ ime.
I know this, but something is different this time around.	Amaara m nke a, ma ọ dị ihe dị iche n'oge a.
He tried for years, man.	Ọ gbalịrị ọtụtụ afọ, nwoke.
You are less likely to do that.	Ọ dị obere ka ị ga-eme nke ahụ.
Beautiful actors.	Ndị na-eme ihe nkiri mara mma.
He looked me up and down.	O lere m anya elu na ala.
A small town nearby.	Obere obodo dị nso.
So the first word of why is.	Ya mere okwu mbụ nke ihe kpatara ya bụ.
Now is the time to be ready.	Ugbu a, bụ mgbe ọ dị njikere.
There is no time to really do it.	Enweghị oge iji mee ya n'ezie.
Indoor fire.	Ọkụ n'ime ụlọ.
Court for the case.	Ụlọ ikpe maka ikpe ahụ.
But it does not seem to be.	Ma o yighị ka ọ ga-abụ.
No one can say this.	Ọ dịghị mmadụ nwere ike ikwu nke a.
That is a beautiful thing in this case.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe mara mma na nke a.
No, not many.	Mba, ọ bụghị ọtụtụ.
This is for our staff and our community.	Nke a bụ maka ndị ọrụ anyị na ndị obodo anyị.
I do not know you.	Amaghị m gị.
He did not seem to know that it would be.	O yighị ka ọ maghị na ọ ga-abụ.
I try to keep it out of the way.	M na-agbalị ime ka ọ ghara ịdị n'otu.
Which no one wants.	Nke ọ dịghị onye chọrọ.
The program will be great for kids.	Ihe omume ahụ ga-adị mma maka ụmụaka.
His behavior surprised me.	Omume ya juru m anya.
This is a bad idea.	Nke a bụ echiche ọjọọ.
One, work is his job alone.	Otu, ọrụ bụ ọrụ ya naanị.
For worse.	Maka njọ.
So it goes.	Ya mere ọ na-aga.
This is not just an application.	Nke a abụghị naanị ngwa.
I had a fever.	Ahụ́ ọkụ malitere m.
But she could not do anything.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe ọ pụrụ ime.
Or he may actually be thinking about it.	Ma ọ bụ ọ pụrụ n'ezie na-eche banyere ya.
Her eyes filled with tears.	Anya mmiri ya malitere ịgba.
We were never close.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị nọ nso.
Not all information is available.	Ọ bụghị ozi niile dị.
I love this organization.	Ahụrụ m nzukọ a n'anya.
Hence the money.	N'ihi ya ego.
The doctor gave a lot of medicine.	Dọkịta ahụ nyere ọgwụ dị ukwuu.
They left the party early.	Ha hapụrụ oriri ahụ n’oge.
Everything is expensive these days.	Ihe niile dị oke ọnụ ụbọchị ndị a.
Like that.	Dị ka nke ahụ.
But at that time, it will last a long time !.	Ma n'oge ahụ, ọ ga-anọ ogologo oge!.
The man was amazed at the points.	Isi ihe ndị ahụ tụrụ nwoke ahụ n'anya.
And this is the case.	Na nke a bụ ikpe.
The book contains information on language.	Akwụkwọ ahụ nwere ozi gbasara asụsụ.
I can't get used to them.	Apụghị m ịma ha ahụ́.
He is a good swimmer.	Ọ bụ ezigbo onye igwu mmiri.
It is far from certain.	Ọ dị anya na ụfọdụ.
She is a woman.	Ọ bụ nwanyị.
That’s down !.	Nke ahụ bụ ala ala!.
The power went out for hours.	Ike ahụ kwụsịrị ruo ọtụtụ awa.
It’s there, it can’t go, it’s there.	Ọ dị ebe ahụ, ọ gaghị aga, ọ dị ebe ahụ.
It was all he wanted in a woman.	Ọ bụ ihe niile ọ chọrọ n'ime nwanyị.
All these things will be in one machine.	Ihe ndị a niile ga-adị n'otu igwe.
Certainly not them.	O doro anya na ọ bụghị ha nwoke.
What is his name?	Gịnị bụ aha ya?
But now he is my best friend.	Ma ugbu a, ọ bụ ezigbo enyi m.
I was on my own.	Anọ m n'akụkụ onwe m.
No one called a doctor.	Ọ dịghị onye kpọrọ dọkịta.
It may have been left over by someone else.	O nwere ike ịbụ naanị ihe onye ọzọ hapụrụ ebe ahụ.
Yet, none of them would have gone there.	Ma n'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha agaraghị ya ebe ahụ.
So? 	Ya mere?
That would be three.	Nke ahụ ga-abụ atọ.
I just try to be myself.	M nnọọ na-agbalị ịbụ onwe m.
Says a lot about them.	Na-ekwu ọtụtụ ihe banyere ha.
The staff, however, saw it differently.	Otú ọ dị, ndị ọrụ hụrụ ya n'ụzọ dị iche.
And you want this or that.	Na ị chọrọ nke a ma ọ bụ nke ahụ.
The flesh fell.	Anụ ahụ dara.
But everything is old story.	Mana ihe niile bụ akụkọ ochie.
But it turned out to be just that.	Ma ọ bịara bụrụ nnọọ nke ahụ.
It’s kind of a long story.	Ọ bụ ụdị ogologo akụkọ.
We studied film history last year.	Anyị mụrụ akụkọ ihe mere eme ihe nkiri n'afọ gara aga.
I gave him a lot of confidence.	M nyere ya obi ike dị ukwuu.
As we both know we have it.	Dị ka anyị abụọ maara na anyị nwere ya.
They can’t get the color right.	Ha enweghị ike ị nweta agba nke ọma.
So the woman's question made sense.	Ya mere ajụjụ nke nwanyị ahụ nwere ezi uche.
We have a hardwood species in the interior.	Anyị nwere ụdị osisi siri ike n'ime ime.
He looked around the car.	O lere anya n'akụkụ ụgbọ ala ahụ.
For something different than yours.	Maka ihe dị iche iche karịa nke gị.
They say, give them no.	Ha na-ekwu, nye ha mba.
Driving is unique in other ways, too.	Ịnya ụgbọ ahụ pụrụ iche n'ụzọ ndị ọzọ, kwa.
The football stadium is famous for its playground.	Ụlọ egwuregwu bọọlụ ama ama maka ebe egwuregwu ya.
However, in practice.	Otú ọ dị, na omume n'ezie.
Somehow he made his way back.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ mere ụzọ ya azụ.
Plants are, can.	Osisi bụ, nwere ike.
Old, new, good friends.	Ochie, ndị ọhụrụ, ezi ndị enyi.
Comes at a high price.	Na-abịa na ọnụ ahịa dị elu.
We will not make rules.	Anyị agaghị eme iwu.
It can have.	O nwere ike inwe.
But the basic rule is the same.	Ma isi iwu bụ otu.
By all means.	N'ụzọ niile.
Small, small, small amounts of money are happening now.	Obere, obere, obere ego na-eme ugbu a.
So off they go.	Ya mere, ha na-aga njem.
You have the power of that.	Ị nwere ikike nke ahụ.
I am a woman.	Abụ m nwanyị.
The need to have it now is very urgent.	Mkpa ya inwe ugbu a dị oke ngwa ngwa.
He knows all about the local market.	Ọ maara ihe niile gbasara ahịa obodo.
It should be an opportunity to make a difference.	O kwesịrị ịbụ ohere ime ihe dị iche.
No, the idea is absurd.	Mba, echiche ahụ bụ ihe nzuzu.
You know the problem.	Ị maara nsogbu ahụ.
The story does not suggest.	Akụkọ ahụ anaghị atụ aro.
I want to know about your family.	Achọrọ m ịma gbasara ezinụlọ gị.
Let's go.	Ka na-aga.
That is the bad news.	Nke ahụ bụ akụkọ ọjọọ ahụ.
He went to the back door.	Ọ gara n'ọnụ ụzọ azụ.
Get the other one.	Nweta nke ọzọ.
Life is still good.	Ndụ ka dị mma.
It is the same.	Ọ bụ otu ihe ahụ.
So it is really there that it is true.	Ya mere ọ bụ n'ezie ebe ahụ na ọ bụ eziokwu.
The question now is whether they will actually happen.	Ajụjụ ugbu a bụ ma ha ga-eme n'ezie.
It can be done.	Enwere ike ime ya.
No matter how high a perfect human family is.	N'agbanyeghị otú ezinụlọ zuru oke mmadụ si dị elu.
I do not know what it is.	Amaghị m ihe ọ bụ.
A local doctor gave her a new life.	Otu dọkịta obodo nyere ya ndụ ọhụrụ.
He took it again when he stopped.	O were ya ọzọ mgbe ọ kwụsịrị.
We can do all this.	Anyị nwere ike ime ihe a niile.
You told us that.	Ị gwara anyị nke ahụ.
We do not.	Anyị anaghị eme ya.
Such people.	Ndị dị otú ahụ.
We all know and agree with each other.	Anyị niile maara ma kwere ka ibe anyị.
I have this.	Enwere m ihe a.
However, it is far from home.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dị anya site n'ụlọ.
He took a bag full of food.	O were ihe oriri juru otu akpa.
He did it three times.	O mere ya ugboro atọ.
I'm sorry at first.	Ọ dị m nwute na mbụ.
You know exactly why.	Ị maara nke ọma ihe kpatara ya.
I can't see it very well.	Enweghị m ike ịhụ ya nke ọma.
He knew he did not want it.	Ọ ma na ya achọghị ya.
People come every day.	Ndị mmadụ na-abịa kwa ụbọchị.
There is nothing special about this.	Ọ dịghị ihe pụrụ iche banyere nke a.
He knew nothing about his financial situation.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ bụla gbasara ọnọdụ ego ya.
It seems like this for the community.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị otu a maka obodo.
We never looked at each other.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị hapụrụ anya ibe anyị.
Tell us how much money, time and date.	Gwa anyị ego ole, oge na ụbọchị.
We will do it.	Anyị ga-eme ya.
That's true.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu.
Not only that.	Ọ bụghị naanị.
In fact, it certainly does a useful job.	N'ezie, o doro anya na ọ na-arụ ọrụ bara uru.
Can you tell me why your back hand.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa m ihe mere aka azụ gị.
But he seems to be a very good friend now.	Ma ọ dị ka ezigbo enyi ugbu a.
You can do more than this shop.	Ị nwere ike ime ihe karịrị ụlọ ahịa a.
In fact, they need each other.	N'ezie, ha chọrọ ibe ha.
It should be easy.	O kwesịrị ịdị mfe.
Of course, this work is the last.	N'ezie, ọrụ a bụ nke ikpeazụ.

Vacation time is a time to give.	Oge ezumike bụ oge inye ihe.
There seems to be an important authority here.	Ọ dị ka enwere ikike dị mkpa ebe a.
I really feel that way.	Enwere m mmetụta nke ahụ n'ezie.
He left her behind.	Ọ hapụrụ ya n'azụ.
What kind of man would do.	Kedu ụdị nwoke ga-eme.
They are very different.	Ha dị nnọọ iche.
It takes courage to face that reality.	Achọrọ obi ike ihu nke bụ eziokwu.
I know his mother very well.	Amaara m nne ya nke ọma.
The music is hot.	Egwu ahụ dị ọkụ.
It's wrong.	Ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ.
He knows everything and nothing.	Ọ maara ihe niile na ọ dịghị ihe.
I know there are many.	Ama m na ọ dị ọtụtụ.
It was like the others on the same ship.	Ọ dị ka ndị ọzọ nọ n'otu ụgbọ mmiri.
First of all, the story is interesting.	Nke mbụ, akụkọ ahụ na-atọ ụtọ.
He says a lot about his work.	Ọ na-ekwu ọtụtụ ihe gbasara ọrụ ya.

Of course not, no.	N'ezie mba, ọ bụghị.

You can live only three days without water.	Ị nwere ike ịdị ndụ naanị ụbọchị atọ na-enweghị mmiri.
I do not understand the building.	Aghọtaghị m ụlọ ahụ.
That is their job and they both do it well.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ ha ma ha abụọ na-arụ ya nke ọma.
No one can do it.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere ike ime ya.
It is difficult to say how much water you left behind.	O siri ike ikwu ole mmiri ị hapụrụ.

It is on the first page.	Ọ dị na ibe mbụ.

He loves power.	Ọ hụrụ ike n'anya.
He does not need to see where they are going.	Ọ dịghị ya mkpa ịhụ ebe ha na-aga.
I am happy if you can help me.	Obi dị m ụtọ ma ọ bụrụ na ị nwere ike inyere m aka.

These new songs are awesome.	Egwu ọhụrụ ndị a dị egwu.
Of course, you know me.	N'ezie, ị maara m.
On the other hand.	N'akụkụ aka nke ọzọ.
I think you like this body.	Echere m na ahụ a masịrị gị.
The relief is obvious.	Ihe enyemaka ahụ doro anya.
Most of it is good, but not very good.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ya dị mma, mana ọ bụghị nke ọma.
The situation seemed hopeless.	Ọnọdụ ahụ yiri enweghị olileanya.
All he has to do is tell the truth.	Naanị ihe ọ ga-eme bụ ikwu eziokwu.
The family left this summer.	Ezinụlọ ahụ pụrụ n'oge okpomọkụ a.
I would like anything else.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ ga-amasị m.
The car crashed twice while on the road.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ dara ugboro abụọ ka ọ nọ n'ụzọ.
But that will not happen soon.	Mana nke ahụ agaghị eme n'oge adịghị anya.
But now you know it's not that easy.	Ma ugbu a, ị maara na ọ dịghị mfe otú ahụ.
You make us think.	Ị na-eme ka anyị na-eche echiche.
All of these things have two requirements.	Ihe ndị a niile nwere ihe abụọ achọrọ.
You must do what you did.	Ị ga-eme ihe i mere.
That is what will happen.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ga-eme.
I do not want to tell you.	Achọghị m ịgwa gị.
We have no right to speak to these people again.	Anyị enweghị ikike ịgwa ndị a okwu ọzọ.
But he did not know.	Ma ọ maghị.
The movie is very entertaining.	Ihe nkiri ahụ na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
But that’s fine, you don’t want anyone.	Mana nke ahụ dị mma, ị chọghị onye ọ bụla.
Eat it well with meat.	Rie ya nke ọma na anụ.
Three years before he knew this city.	Afọ atọ tupu ọ mara obodo a.
The meat is expensive.	Anụ ahụ dị oke ọnụ.
I would never have that kind of thing in this house.	Agaghị m enwe ụdị ihe ahụ n'ụlọ a.
She will be my sister.	Ọ ga-abụ nwanne m nwanyị.

There are many different functions.	Enwere ọtụtụ ọrụ dị iche iche.

This is a problem for three main reasons.	Nke a bụ nsogbu maka isi ihe atọ.
This order started immediately.	Iwu a malitere ozugbo.
For three hours. 	Maka awa atọ. 
We are reasonable when we do not have feelings.	Anyị na-enwe ezi uche mgbe anyị enweghị mmetụta uche.
It is a good job.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ọrụ n'aka.
The customer is interested in his success.	Onye ahịa ahụ nwere mmasị na ihe ịga nke ọma ya.
I think something is happening.	Echere m na ọ dị ihe na-eme.
I am myself.	Abụ m onwe m.
He goes home.	Ọ na-aga n'ụlọ.
This is just a lot.	Nke a bụ nnọọ ọtụtụ.
That made me feel awesome, but in a positive way.	Nke ahụ mere ka m nwee mmetụta dị egwu, mana n'ụzọ dị mma.
During morning coffee.	N'oge kọfị ụtụtụ.
I began to have doubts.	M malitere inwe obi abụọ.
When they are working with you.	Mgbe ha na-arụ ọrụ na gị.
Electric furnace is a type of thermal sensor.	Igwe ọkụ ọkụ bụ ụdị ihe mmetụta okpomọkụ.
He was surprised.	O juru ya anya.
One cannot love them.	Mmadụ enweghị ike ịhụ ha n'anya.
He knows he is doing something wrong.	Ọ ma na ya na-eme ihe ọjọọ.
One knows it.	Otu maara ka ọ dị.
I can tell them why.	Enwere m ike ịgwa ha ihe kpatara ya.
The room is nice.	Ime ụlọ ahụ dị mma.
The same is true of everything else.	Otú ahụ ka ihe ọ bụla ọzọ dị.
We are free.	Anyị nwere onwe anyị.
He knows his way around.	Ọ maara ụzọ ya gburugburu.
He hoped to see a better job.	Ọ tụrụ anya ịhụ ọrụ ka mma.
So we were told.	Ya mere a gwara anyị.
This time it will.	Oge a ọ ga-eme.
He smiled at the meal.	O were ọnụ ọchị nye nri ahụ.
But for a woman, the same practice has a negative effect in some way.	Ma n'ebe nwanyị nọ, otu omume ahụ nwere mmetụta na-adịghị mma n'ụzọ ụfọdụ.
Sleep.	Ụra ahụ.
I will have something different.	M ga-enwe ihe dị iche.
You do not have to.	Ọ naghị adị gị mkpa.
The main thing to use.	Isi ihe eji.
We saw little people there.	Anyị hụrụ ụmụ obere mmadụ n'ebe ahụ.
Around their backs are the same.	Gburugburu azụ ha bụ otu ihe.
It always has, it will always be.	Ọ na-enwe mgbe niile, ọ ga-adị mgbe niile.
But then, that might be a good thing.	Ma mgbe ahụ, nke ahụ nwere ike ịbụ ihe dị mma.
I know it will be cheaper.	Ama m na ọ ga-adị ọnụ ala.
I'll see you.	Aga m ahụ gị.
They go hand in hand.	Ha na-aga aka na aka.
Not that he knew about them.	Ọ bụghị na ọ ma banyere ha.
Can't say anything.	Enweghị ike ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
It has the advantage of home instruction nearby.	Ọ nwere uru nkuzi ụlọ dị nso.
Her frightened sister walked to the house.	Nwanne ya nwanyị ji ụjọ ji ụkwụ gaa n'ụlọ ahụ.
He lives somewhere in the big city.	O bi n'otu ebe n'ime nnukwu obodo.
Many of them are meaningless.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ya enweghị isi.

We did well on our own.	Anyị mere nke ọma n'onwe anyị.
People were looking for more.	Ndị mmadụ nọ na-achọ karịa.
Think of it as a game of all time.	Were ya dị ka egwuregwu oge niile.
I know that very well.	Amaara m nke ahụ nke ọma.
Maybe you want to get out, get home.	Ma eleghị anya, ị chọrọ ịpụ, ịla n'ụlọ.
She knew he loved her.	Ọ ma na ọ hụrụ ya n’anya maka ya.
These are two very different words.	Ndị a bụ okwu abụọ dị iche iche.
Awesome stuff is there.	Ihe dị egwu dị ebe ahụ.
You can use any of them to your liking.	Ị nwere ike iji nke ọ bụla n'ime ha masịrị gị.
Very long too.	Ogologo oke oke.
You know that you should not be here.	Ị ma na i kwesịghị ịnọ ebe a.
But it’s just the game.	Mana ọ bụ naanị egwuregwu ahụ.
He is well aware that his actions are strong.	Ọ maara nke ọma na omume ya siri ike.
Every word is stupid.	Okwu ọ bụla bụ nzuzu.
You can not earn money.	Enweghị ike ị nweta ego.
You will be a vacationer in your own home.	Ị ga-abụ onye ezumike n'ụlọ gị.
We now have four children, but we have only one then.	Anyị nwere ụmụ anọ ugbu a, ma anyị nwere naanị otu mgbe ahụ.
I think that was the worst time.	Echere m na nke ahụ bụ oge kacha njọ.
But most of me.	Ma ọtụtụ m.
He loves it here.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'anya ebe a.
This is very stupid.	Nke a bụ nnọọ nzuzu.
For that, nothing.	Maka nke ahụ, ọ dịghị ihe ọ bụla.
Now, if you will.	Ugbu a, ọ bụrụ na ị ga-eme.
It is really useful.	Ọ bara uru n'ezie.
There is no word on it.	Enweghị okwu maka ya.
But he heard me.	Ma ọ nụrụ m.
No one came near him.	Ọ dịghị onye bịara nso ya.
Either angry, or angry.	Ma ọ bụ iwe, ma ọ bụ iwe.
There is no way to achieve that.	Ọ dịghị ụzọ ọ ga-esi nweta nke ahụ.
He took his hand and sat down.	O were aka ya wee nọdụ ala.
They just left him.	Naanị ha hapụrụ ya.
Children are expected to work from an early age.	A tụrụ anya ka ụmụaka na-arụ ọrụ site na nwata.
But we were very happy.	Ma anyị nwere nnọọ obi ụtọ.
People walked there.	Ndị mmadụ ji ụkwụ gaa ebe ahụ.
You’ve been working on it for a long time.	Ị na-arụ ọrụ na ya ogologo oge.
But it does not look like it now.	Mana ọ naghị adị ka ya ugbu a.
Next time we look forward to staying a month.	Oge ọzọ anyị na-atụ anya ịnọ otu ọnwa.
Why did you do that? 	Gịnị mere i ji mee nke ahụ?
I love that it’s clear.	Ahụrụ m n'anya na ọ doro anya.
Is it dangerous.	Ọ dị egwu.
It is not easy to see others enjoying life.	Ọ dịghị mfe ịhụ ndị ọzọ na-eme ihe na-atọ ụtọ.
They gave the city everything they had.	Ha nyere obodo ahụ ihe niile ha nwere.
He asked her a question.	Ọ jụrụ ya ajụjụ.
We got in some way thinking we could do it.	Anyị banyere n'ụzọ ụfọdụ na-eche na anyị nwere ike ime ya.
Only you can not.	Ọ bụ naanị gị enweghị ike.
Come and get some wine.	Bịa were mmanya.

But everyone has.	Ma onye ọ bụla nwere.
There were cold eyes on him.	Anya oyi dị n'anya ya.

Twenty years ago.	Afọ iri abụọ gara aga.
That is where they are tonight.	Ọ bụ ebe ahụ ka ha nọ n'abalị a.

However, he was rushed to a nearby hospital, where police were called.	N’agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ gara ozugbo n’ụlọ ọgwụ, bụ́ ebe a kpọrọ ndị uwe ojii.
There is a fire in this facility.	Enwere ọkụ na ụlọ ọrụ a.

The only way.	Naanị ụzọ.
And the rain came down.	Mmiri wee bịa.
I'll see him.	Aga m ahụ ya.
The room suddenly warms up.	Ime ụlọ ahụ dị ọkụ na mberede.
He does not go home.	Ọ naghị aga n'ụlọ.
Because a lot of things are really clear.	N'ihi na ọtụtụ ihe doro anya n'ezie.
But that is probably for the best.	Ma nke ahụ bụ eleghị anya maka ihe kacha mma.
I don’t think my job.	Adịghị m iche na ọrụ m.
This can be a fun way to play the game.	Nke a nwere ike ịbụ ụzọ na-atọ ụtọ igwu egwuregwu.
You have two reasons to find it.	Ị nwere ihe abụọ kpatara ịchọta ya.

The game will be played with his film.	A ga-eme egwuregwu ahụ na ihe nkiri ya.
Only, he did not have enough time.	Naanị, o nweghị oge zuru oke.
He took his small cup of coffee.	O were obere kọfị ya.

He did not seem so interested.	O yighị ka o nwere mmasị otú ahụ.
They are stubborn.	Ha bụ ndị isi ike.

But the most expensive thing you gave me tonight.	Mana ihe kacha ọnụ nke i nyere m n'abalị a.
It is a good kind of spiritual work.	Ọ bụ ezigbo ụdị ọrụ mmụọ.

He is my older brother.	Ọ bụ nnukwu nwanne m.
I have no doubt it is, word for word, the same thing.	Enweghị m obi abụọ na ọ bụ, okwu maka okwu, otu ihe ahụ.
We make you responsible for making your own.	Anyị na-eme gị ọrụ maka ime nke gị.

Each of them had a car inside, sometimes two.	Onye ọ bụla n'ime ha nwere ụgbọ ala n'ime, mgbe ụfọdụ abụọ.
You will spend a lot of time driving anywhere today.	Ị ga-anọ ogologo oge ịnya ụgbọ ala ebe ọ bụla taa.

If you think about it, it makes perfect sense.	Ọ bụrụ na ị na-eche banyere ya, ọ na-eme ka uche zuru oke.

Anything can happen visually.	Ihe ọ bụla nwere ike ime anya.

She could have told him that she cared about them.	O nwere ike ịgwa ya na ọ na-eche banyere ha.
But for me spirituality is not that.	Ma nye m ihe ime mmụọ abụghị nke ahụ.
Women are important there.	Ụmụ nwanyị dị mkpa ebe ahụ.

At times, they feel ignored.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọ dị ha ka ha achọghị ịma.

The best gift he received was his life.	Onyinye kacha mma o nwetara bụ ndụ ya.

The project was successful.	Ọrụ ahụ gara nke ọma.
Either way, it will happen.	Nke ọ bụla, ọ ga-eme.

People are afraid of him.	Ndị mmadụ na-atụ ya egwu.
This makes the job worse.	Nke a na-eme ka ọrụ ahụ ka njọ.

Or maybe they don’t want to.	Ma ọ bụ ma eleghị anya, ha achọghị.

However, we have two problems.	Otú ọ dị, anyị nwere nsogbu abụọ.
All my teammates are awesome.	Ndị otu m niile dị oke egwu.

It was the first meeting of the two groups.	Ọ bụ nzukọ mbụ nke otu abụọ ahụ.
Okay, get it.	Ọ dị mma, nweta ya.

Four days, and there was no way around it.	Ụbọchị anọ, na ọ dịghị ụzọ gburugburu ya.
He was confident for the first day.	O nwere obi ike maka ụbọchị mbụ.
There are no hospitals in the metropolitan area.	Enweghị ụlọ ọgwụ n'ime oke obodo.
But this led to another problem.	Ma nke a kpatara nsogbu ọzọ.
This requires immediate action.	Nke a chọrọ ime ihe ozugbo.
Great app.	Ngwa dị oke egwu.

Let him tell you how much he enjoys it.	Ka ọ gwa gị ụdị ụtọ ọ na-enwe.
They left the house to a grandson.	Ha hapụrụ ụlọ ahụ nye nwa nwa.
So it can be.	Ya mere, ọ nwere ike ịdị.
It was as if he were waiting for something to happen.	Ọ dị ka ọ nọ na-eche ka o mee ihe.

He came and was very impressed.	Ọ bịara na ndị mmadụ masịrị ya nke ukwuu.
Some friends came to help.	Ụfọdụ ndị enyi bịara nyere m aka.
There are many unknowns.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe amaghị ama.
During that time, they saw many things for themselves.	N'oge ahụ, ha hụrụ onwe ha ọtụtụ ihe.
To tell him something is at home.	Iji gwa ya ka ihe dị n'ụlọ.

And he went out.	O wee pụọ.
My brother said he would come here soon.	Nwanne m nwoke kwuru na ya ga-abịa ebe a ngwa ngwa.

Not difficult to say.	Ọ bụghị ikwu siri ike.

Obviously, that is not possible now.	O doro anya na nke ahụ agaghị ekwe omume ugbu a.

But so long.	Ma otú a ogologo.
That is his job.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ ya.

But it is important.	Ma ọ dị ya mkpa.
He entered into himself.	Ọ banyere n'ime onwe ya.

It was not long before their eyes met.	Obere oge ka anya ha zutere.
Everything is up to you.	Ihe niile dị n'aka gị.

It is good to go your own way.	Ọ bụ ihe dị mma iji ụdị nke gị gaa.
He heard three words.	Ọ nụrụ okwu atọ.
Similar problems.	Nsogbu yiri ya.
I met the man a few times.	M zutere nwoke ahụ ugboro ole na ole.
They filed a lawsuit.	Ha gbara akwụkwọ n'ụlọ ikpe.
Some are better than others.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ha ka ndị ọzọ.
I do not want this kind of life.	Achọghị m ụdị ndụ a.
I do not know where it comes from.	Amaghị m ebe o si.

It looks like he did it and then he did it himself.	Ọ dị ka o mere ya wee mee onwe ya.
But they are not the only ones.	Ma ọ bụghị naanị ha.
That is nothing new.	Nke ahụ abụghị ihe ọhụrụ.
It is not hard to see why.	Ọ bụghị ihe siri ike ịhụ ihe kpatara ya.
The second time he had a name.	Oge nke abụọ o nwere aha.

But they really are.	Ma ha bụ n'ezie.
Now your father.	Ugbu a, nna gị.
Which is bad.	Nke dị njọ.
This is one of those times.	Nke a bụ otu n'ime oge ndị ahụ.

There is so much to see.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe ịhụ.
My message is clear, we are stronger than you.	Ozi m doro anya, anyị siri ike karịa gị.
This will be a new era.	Nke a ga-abụ oge ọhụrụ.
Not her first husband.	Ọ bụghị di mbụ ya.
For me, practice is secondary.	Nye m, omume bụ nke abụọ.
Nothing more.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ karịa ya.
They will keep his lies alive.	Ha ga-eme ka ụgha ya dị ndụ.
I do it for two reasons.	Ana m eme ya n'ihi ihe abụọ.

At the time, the company seemed to be doing well.	N'oge ahụ, ụlọ ọrụ ahụ yiri ka ọ dị mma.
He told me he loved me and left work.	Ọ gwara m na ya hụrụ m n'anya na ya hapụrụ ọrụ.
But all his sons came.	Ma ụmụ ya niile bịara.
The longevity can be long overdue.	Ogologo oge nwere ike ịbụ ogologo oge na-abịa.
What is his name.	Gịnị bụ aha ya .

But there is human life and not just one person.	Ma enwere ndụ mmadụ ma ọ bụghị otu onye.
Give the man a chance.	Nye nwoke ahụ ohere.

The boy's face lit up.	Nwa nwoke ahụ mere ihu.
Worse still.	Nke ka njọ n'ezie.
Mine is small.	Nke m dị obere.

It's something else.	Ọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
Good quality is very good.	Ihe dị mma dị ezigbo mma.
Extremely sudden heat.	Okpomọkụ dị ukwuu na mberede.
His mind is meaningless.	Uche ya enweghị isi.

Is it dangerous.	Ọ dị egwu.
You can eat whenever you want.	Ị nwere ike iri nri oge ọ bụla ịchọrọ.
I would not be happy with it.	Agaghị m enwe obi ụtọ na ya.
He will do it.	Ọ ga-eme ya.
Then you can use them.	Mgbe ahụ ị nwere ike iji ha.
It's hard, for other reasons.	Ọ siri ike, n'ihi ihe ndị ọzọ.
Now the story is different.	Ugbu a akụkọ dị iche.
I have a question if you don’t want to.	Enwere m ajụjụ ma ọ bụrụ na ị chọghị.
I love them.	Ahụrụ m ha n'anya.

Then things are different.	Mgbe ahụ ihe dị iche.
That’s what it’s coming for.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ na-abịa.
Take as a machine for work.	Were dị ka igwe maka ọrụ.
The ride was very bad this morning.	Ụgbọ njem ahụ dị njọ nke ukwuu n'ụtụtụ a.

What are you planning for the coming weekend.	Kedu ihe ị na-eme atụmatụ izu ụka na-abịa.

Her eyes were burning.	Anya ya gbara ọkụ.
Until that hour, anything could happen.	Ruo oge awa ahụ, ihe ọ bụla nwere ike ime.
This is until this morning.	Nke a bụ ruo ụtụtụ taa.
Just fun, laughter and food.	Naanị ihe ọchị, ọchị na nri.
Here the evil is obvious.	Ebe a ihe ọjọọ doro anya.
But there is some real hope.	Ma, e nwere ụfọdụ ezi olileanya.
No one told me it would be like this.	Ọ dịghị onye gwara m na ọ ga-adị ka nke a.
But the interview is something worth seeing.	Mana ajụjụ ọnụ ahụ bụ ihe kwesịrị ịhụ.
There will be no more.	Agaghị enwe ọzọ.
Then you will not be able to get people away.	Mgbe ahụ, ị ​​​​gaghị enwe ike ime ka ndị mmadụ pụọ.

It was the first time I had been drinking.	Ọ bụ oge mbụ m na anyị na-aṅụ mmanya.

It seems that no one really knew much about him.	O yiri ka ọ dịghị onye maara ọtụtụ ihe banyere ya.
This is an example of the student's work.	Nke a bụ ihe atụ nke ọrụ nwa akwụkwọ ahụ.

Nothing more can be said.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ a pụrụ ikwu.
So its taste is emotional.	Ya mere, ụtọ ya na-enwe mmetụta uche.
But that was my feeling.	Mana nke ahụ bụ mmetụta m.
The beautiful thing is, you never know.	Ihe mara mma bụ, ị gaghị ama ya.
The sailors are not happy.	Obi adịghị ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ ụtọ.
It was a pointless winter.	Ọ bụ ụbọchị oyi na-enweghị isi.

Everything is happening fast here.	Ihe niile na-eme ngwa ngwa ebe a.

This should be done differently.	Ekwesịrị ime nke a n'ụzọ dị iche.
That has its own truth.	Nke ahụ nwere eziokwu nke ya.
That is one of the reasons he was a good leader.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime ihe mere o ji bụrụ ezigbo onye isi.
We never wanted to do that.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị chọrọ ime otú ahụ.
You may find that they are not ready.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ na ha adịghị njikere.

For example, a baby is dead.	Dị ka ihe atụ, nwa nwụrụ anwụ.

If they did not do so, the truth would have to be revealed.	Ọ bụrụ na ha emeghị otú ahụ, ekwesịrị ime ka a mara nke bụ́ eziokwu.

That is because we are beautiful in this.	Nke ahụ bụ n'ihi na anyị mara mma na nke a.
I still think, of course.	M ka na-eche, n'ezie.
We want something new, something new.	Anyị chọrọ ihe ọhụrụ, ihe ọhụrụ.

So sit down.	Ya mere nọdụ ala.
It will take courage.	Ọ ga-achọ obi ike.
When he asked her the name she gave him a lie.	Mgbe ọ jụrụ ya aha ọ nyere ya nke ụgha.
A little money will do everything.	Obere ego ga-eme ihe niile.
One of those situations is trouble.	Otu n'ime ọnọdụ ndị ahụ bụ nsogbu.
That is what she is so afraid of.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ụjọ tụrụ ya nke ukwuu.
Sit back and relax.	Nọdụ ala zuru ike.

They looked at each other.	Ha lere ibe ha anya.
You do not have to think about it.	I kwesịghị iche echiche banyere ya.
I want him to do anything and everything.	Achọrọ m ka o mee ihe ọ bụla na ihe niile.
He said it would not work.	O kwuru na ọ gaghị arụ ọrụ.

They are everywhere, he said.	Ha nọ ebe niile, o kwuru.

Many examples of such approaches can be found in the book.	Enwere ike ịhụ ọtụtụ ihe atụ maka ụzọ ndị dị otú ahụ na akwụkwọ.

But the differences are not the same.	Ma ihe ndị dị iche abụghị otu.

It is always better to be honest.	Ọ ka mma mgbe niile ikwu eziokwu.

The reason may be the cost of medicines.	Ihe kpatara ya nwere ike ịbụ ọnụ ahịa ọgwụ.
You are hardly strong right now.	O siri ike ị dị ike ugbu a.
He has nothing to do with it.	Ọ nweghị ihe ọ ga-eme ya.

Obviously, she did not like it.	O doro anya na otú o si mee ya achọghị ya.

While in the theater he began to feel the effects of drugs.	Mgbe ọ nọ n'ụlọ ihe nkiri ọ malitere inwe mmetụta ọgwụ ọjọọ.

This book has three of them.	Akwụkwọ a nwere ha atọ.
However, it will be an important event in his life.	Otú ọ dị, ọ ga-abụ ihe dị mkpa ná ndụ ya.
This kind of thing cannot go on.     	Ụdị ihe a enweghị ike ịga n'ihu.     
The man was strong.	Nwoke ahụ siri ike.

Everyone saw it.	Onye ọ bụla hụrụ ya.
This is not a problem for us.	Nke a abụghị nsogbu nye anyị.
He said it was good news.	O kwuru na ọ bụ ozi ọma.
I do not want to be alone.	Adịghị m mma ịnọ naanị m.
I just don't think this much.	M nnọọ echeghị na nke a ukwuu.
Then your friends or family can easily see you.	Mgbe ahụ, ndị enyi gị ma ọ bụ ezinụlọ gị nwere ike ịhụ gị n'ụzọ dị mfe.
He would be a good father.	Ọ ga-abụ ezigbo nna.
I know how you feel, but this is a police operation.	Amaara m mmetụta ị ga-enwe, mana nke a bụ ọrụ uwe ojii.
When the meeting was held.	Mgbe e mere ọmụmụ ihe.
It sounds like it, but it's different.	Ọ dị ka ọ dị, mana ọ dị iche.
Let it be.	Ka ọ bụrụ.
I don’t miss my whole morning fast around.	Anaghị m atụ uche m niile ụtụtụ ngwa ngwa gburugburu.
You know some of them.	Ị maara ụfọdụ n'ime ha.
I wondered how he got that way.	M nọ na-eche otú o si nweta ụzọ ahụ.
In their hunger.	Na agụụ ha.
But it's really simple, that it says very simple.	Ma ọ bụ n'ezie dị mfe, na ọ na-ekwu nnọọ mfe.
Maybe somewhere in his head, there was the thought that we had failed him.	Ma eleghị anya, ebe n'isi ya, e nwere echiche na anyị dara ya.
He was a vegetarian.	Ọ bụ onye anaghị eri anụ.
I hope it helps you !.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ ga-enyere gị aka!.
Everyone knows them there and loves them.	Onye ọ bụla maara ha n'ebe ahụ ma hụ ha n'anya.
They want me.	Ha chọrọ m.
The important thing is that they have friends.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ na ha nwere ndị enyi.
However, the situation was not easy as expected.	Otú ọ dị, ọnọdụ ahụ adịghị mfe dị ka a tụrụ anya ya.
In fact, it will be both of them.	N'ezie, ọ ga-abụ ha abụọ.
You are big, young and powerful.	Ị dị ukwuu, nwata ma nwee ike.
That, being the fastest, is the most important.	Nke ahụ, ịbụ ihe kacha ngwa ngwa, bụ ihe kacha mkpa.
That only happens.	Nke ahụ na-eme naanị.
That is a big job.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ọrụ.

How much money.	Ego ole ike.
It’s like a real person and someone else is talking.	Ọ dị ka onye n'ezie na onye ọzọ na-ekwu okwu.
Work your work around them.	Na-arụ ọrụ gị gburugburu ha.
He studied this for years.	Ọ mụrụ ihe a ruo ọtụtụ afọ.
And the boy.	Na nwata ahụ.
This is useful.	Nke a bara uru.
That works sometimes.	Nke ahụ na-arụ ọrụ mgbe ụfọdụ.
However, there is no absolute rule.	Otú ọ dị, enweghị iwu zuru oke.
So do this then.	Ya mere mee nke a mgbe ahụ.
My name is not there.	Aha m anọghị ebe ahụ.
It was a little low at night.	Ọ dị ntakịrị ala n'abalị.
They do not promise anything.	Ha anaghị ekwe nkwa ihe ọ bụla.
You’re there for most of it.	Ị nọ ebe ahụ maka ọtụtụ n'ime ya.
Probably the third.	Ma eleghị anya, nke atọ.
They see nothing.	Ha ahụghị ihe ọ bụla.
I looked at my father.	M lere nna m anya.
It is not easy to find your way.	Ọ dịghị mfe ịchọta ụzọ gị.
This may take less time than one might expect.	Nke a nwere ike ime obere oge karịa ka mmadụ nwere ike chọọ.

Nowadays, a lot of simple information is available.	N'oge a, ọtụtụ ozi dị mfe dị.
May I have you some clothes?	Enwere m ike ị nweta gị uwe.
However, it does not matter.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mkpa.
Nothing more or less.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ ma ọ bụ obere.
He does not have a driver's license.	O nweghị akwụkwọ ikike ịnya ụgbọ ala.

A playful person.	Onye na-egwu egwu onye.
Or that they were made a long time ago.	Ma ọ bụ na e mere ha ogologo oge gara aga.
There’s a lot going on, all in all.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe na-aga n'ihu, ọnọdụ niile.
Home, however, is easier said than done.	Ịla n'ụlọ, Otú ọ dị, ọ dị mfe ikwu wee mee ya.
I know how it feels.	Amaara m otú ọ dị.
I do not know what to do next.	Amaghị m ihe ọzọ m ga-eme.

So it goes for it.	Ya mere ọ na-aga maka ya.
They are so beautiful.	Ha mara mma nke ukwuu.
I really like it.	Ọ masịrị m nnọọ.
I hope your day goes well.	Enwere m olileanya na ụbọchị gị na-aga nke ọma.
There is no reason for it.	O nweghị ihe kpatara ya.
The man should call his son.	Nwoke ahụ kwesịrị ịkpọ nwa ya nwoke.
A terrible event took place in front of a frightened crowd.	Ihe omume dị egwu mere n'ihu igwe mmadụ ahụ ụjọ tụrụ.
This process is repeated.	A na-arụ ọrụ a ugboro ugboro.
Where will we stay?	Kedu ebe anyị ga-anọ.
But it is really not possible to do it.	Mana adịghị ike ime ya n'ezie.
They love what they do.	Ha hụrụ ihe ha na-eme n’anya.
His father was the only thing he left behind.	Nna ya bụ naanị ihe ọ hapụrụ.

Of all living things, human beings are unique.	N'ime ihe niile dị ndụ, ụmụ mmadụ pụrụ iche.
You love your home.	Ị hụrụ ụlọ gị n'anya.
At school.	N'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
It had not been known for the past two years.	A maghị ya ruo afọ abụọ gara aga.
I will not have any problems.	Agaghị m enwe nsogbu.
Legal work is one of these.	Ọrụ iwu bụ otu n'ime ndị a.
So the movie doesn’t work.	Ya mere ihe nkiri ahụ anaghị arụ ọrụ.
That is not unreasonable.	Nke ahụ abụghị maka ihe ezi uche na-adịghị na ya.
He left only what was worthwhile.	Ọ hapụrụ naanị ihe bara uru.
That works well.	Nke na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma.
I could not believe it when he told me.	Apụghị m ikweta mgbe ọ gwara m.
But in the second week, he said they were still saying nothing.	Ma n'izu nke abụọ, o kwuru na ha ka na-ekwu ihe ọ bụla.
That way, he would not be interested.	N'ụzọ dị otú ahụ, ọ gaghị enwe mmasị na ya.
From patients and their families.	Site n'aka ndị ọrịa na ezinụlọ ha.
You can stay in this house at any time.	Ị nwere ike ịnọ n'ụlọ a n'oge ọ bụla.
Well, this is as well.	Ọ dị mma, nke a dị ka nke ọma.
Not a beautiful car, by the way.	Ọ bụghị ụgbọ ala mara mma, n'ụzọ ọ bụla.

You may think that they used it well.	Ị nwere ike iche na ha ji ya mee ihe nke ọma.
But you can find them in your own store.	Ma ị nwere ike ịchọta ha na ụlọ ahịa nke aka gị.
It looks like nothing happened.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ihe mere.
There are many types.	E nwere ọtụtụ ụdị.
In exactly one year.	N'otu afọ n'ezie.
I would like it very much.	Ọ ga-amasị m nke ukwuu.
Same thing with a restaurant.	Otu ihe na ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ.
We never spoke the same language.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị na-asụ otu asụsụ.
Then you have something to go to or for.	Mgbe ahụ ị nwere ihe ị ga-aga ma ọ bụ maka.
No need to call ahead.	Ọ dịghị mkpa ịkpọ n'ihu.
That woman is.	Nwanyị ahụ bụ ya.
I don’t think it will happen today.	Echeghị m na ọ ga-eme taa.
It's good to get it.	Ọ dị mma ka o nweta ya.
But it is for the best.	Ma, ọ bụ maka ihe kacha mma.
That was what we expected.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị tụrụ anya ya.
It may well be.	O nwere ike ịbụ nke ọma.
I still believe in it, as a team.	M ka kwere na ya, dị ka ndị otu.
The first is the same price.	Nke mbụ bụ otu ọnụ ahịa.
She seems to be in good health, but she is not strong.	Ọ dị ka ahụ́ siri ya ike, ma ọ dịghị ike.
The role of nutrition and behavior in childhood.	Ọrụ nke nri na omume na nwata.
Books like this might be what they want.	Akwụkwọ dị ka nke a nwere ike ịbụ ihe ha chọrọ.
It seems worth the time to find it.	Ọ dị ka ọ bara uru oge ịchọta ya.
Three days thus.	Ụbọchị atọ si otú a.
I hear what you say.	Ana m anụ ihe ị na-ekwu.
Some of those things are going on.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ihe ndị ahụ na-aga n'ihu.
I could not go because of time.	Enweghị m ike ịga n'ihi oge.
So it stays, waiting for you, with us.	Ya mere ọ nọrọ, na-eche gị, na anyị.
There is not much else he can do here.	O nweghị ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ o nwere ike isi ebe a mee.
I saw my phone.	Ahụrụ m ekwentị m anya.
He said so.	O kwuru otú ahụ.
All these buildings are the same.	Ụlọ ndị a niile yiri otu.
They are eating.	Ha na-eri nri.
But we are very busy trying to keep the movie going.	Ma anyị ji nnọọ ọrụ n’aka na-agbalị ime ka ihe nkiri ahụ na-aga n’ihu.
These people do not like it.	Ndị a enweghị mmasị ya.
Otherwise, you will have a long journey.	Ma ọ bụghị ya, ị ga-enwe njem dị ogologo.
But that would be too expensive and too expensive.	Mana nke ahụ ga-abụ oke ọnụ na oke oke.
The company plays football.	Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ na-agba bọọlụ.
However, of course the work is very difficult for many reasons.	Otú ọ dị, n'ezie ọrụ bụ nnọọ ike n'ihi na ọtụtụ ihe.
Land in the village.	Ala n'ime obodo.
But for whatever reason, he wants to stay ahead.	Ma n'ihi ihe ọ bụla kpatara ya, ọ chọrọ ịnọ n'ihu.
Good words, kind words.	Okwu ọma, okwu ọma.
The best thing they can do is shoot it.	Ihe kacha mma ha na-eme bụ ịgba ya.
I miss him every day.	Ana m atụ uche ya kwa ụbọchị.
They tried, but they failed.	Ha gbalịrị, ma ha dara.
The rest of us move on.	Anyị ndị ọzọ na-aga n'ihu.
I look forward to it.	Ana m atụ anya ya.
As he spoke, he took some water.	Ka ọ na-ekwu okwu, ọ were otu mmiri.
So let’s see if it works.	Ya mere, ka anyị hụ ma ọ na-arụ ọrụ.
I do not know very well.	Amaghị m nke ọma.
We do not expect anything.	Anyị anaghị atụ anya ihe ọ bụla.
It's really easy.	Ọ dị mfe n'ezie.
Four fish today.	Azụ anọ taa.
Nothing happens until you do something.	Ọ dịghị ihe na-eme ruo mgbe i mere ihe.
That is really beautiful.	Nke ahụ mara mma n'ezie.
I like it !.	Ọ na-amasị m!.
Then the people died.	Mgbe ahụ, ndị ahụ nwụrụ.
Just the two things.	Naanị ihe abụọ ahụ.
It is difficult to say what you are saying.	O siri ike ikwu ihe ị na-ekwu.
He needs a job.	Ọ chọrọ ọrụ.
It seems to end abruptly.	Ọ dị ka ọ kwụsịrị na mberede.
No one wants this.	Ọ dịghị onye chọrọ nke a.
But we want our students there.	Mana anyị chọrọ ụmụ akwụkwọ anyị n'ebe ahụ.
The dress is at the door.	Uwe ahụ dị n'ọnụ ụzọ.
It is my benefit.	Ọ bụ uru m.
This is not possible, by.	Nke a agaghị ekwe omume, site.
That is a delicious tree.	Nke ahụ bụ osisi nwere ụtọ.
The doctor stopped talking.	Dọkịta ahụ kwụsịrị ikwu okwu.
I just had to be fine one night.	Naanị m kwesịrị ịdị mma otu abalị.
We should not do that.	Anyị ekwesịghị ime otú ahụ.
I know he will do it.	Amaara m na ọ ga-eme ya.
That started things up.	Nke ahụ malitere ihe.
The road is full of houses.	Ụzọ ahụ nwere ụlọ juru.
One man was amazed.	O juru otu nwoke anya.
Many died along the way.	Ọtụtụ ndị nwụrụ n'ụzọ.
The messenger was interested in his work.	Onye ozi ahụ nwere mmasị na ọrụ ya.
I can not do it.	Enweghị m ike ime ya.
His success is enormous.	Ihe ịga nke ọma ya dị nnọọ ukwuu.
But that is just the point.	Ma nke ahụ bụ naanị isi ihe.
Take that.	Were nke ahụ.
One of the two things that is going to happen right now.	Otu n'ime ihe abụọ na-aga ime ugbu a.
You can not be true.	Ị gaghị enwe ike ịbụ eziokwu.
To many, it is simply a fad.	Nye ọtụtụ ndị, ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ nke enweghị mmasị.
I don't want that face.	Achọghị m ihu nke ahụ ihu.
Many did.	Ọtụtụ ndị mere ya.
I would like to have a little more than just something out there.	Ọ ga-amasị m inwe ntakịrị karịa ihe dị ebe ahụ.
But there is more to the threat.	Mana enwere ihe ọzọ dị n'ihe egwu.
To our surprise, he died.	O juru anyị anya na ọ nwụrụ.
But you want them to be the best they can be.	Ma ị chọrọ ka ha bụrụ ndị kacha mma ha nwere ike.
We are a self-reliant community now.	Anyị bụ obodo kwere na onwe ya ugbu a.
I can see the problem.	Enwere m ike ịhụ nsogbu ahụ.
It's a beautiful idea.	Ọ bụ echiche mara mma.
It was a bad time.	Ọ bụ oge ọjọọ.
Interview questions are not fun.	Ajụjụ ọnụ ọrụ adịghị atọ ụtọ.
You will have the same room as before you left.	Ị ga-enwe otu ọnụ ụlọ dị ka tupu ị pụọ.
That is their teaching.	Nke ahụ bụ nkuzi ha.
The place is beautiful, but the city itself has no friends.	Ebe ahụ mara mma, ma obodo ahụ n'onwe ya enweghị enyi.
Nothing works here.	Ọ dịghị ihe na-arụ ọrụ ebe a.
This trip took us months.	Njem a were anyị ọnwa.
Travel is not for everyone.	Njem abụghị maka onye ọ bụla.
You do not know.	Ị maghị.
I still wonder if it really matters.	M ka na-eche ma ọ̀ dị mkpa n'ezie.
We have a lot of kids like him here.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ ụmụaka dị ka ya ebe a.
He was a teacher of history.	Ọ bụ onye nkuzi akụkọ ihe mere eme.
He is a vegetarian, but he sometimes eats fish.	Ọ bụ onye anaghị eri anụ, mana ọ na-eri azụ mgbe ụfọdụ.
The machine is surrounded by lightning.	Igwe ọkụ gbara igwe ahụ gburugburu.
Anything like this is required.	Achọrọ ihe ọ bụla n'ime ihe a.
There is only this place.	Enwere naanị ebe a.
Or from here.	Ma ọ bụ si ebe a.
It is well known.	A maara ya nke ọma.
Some love it.	Ụfọdụ hụrụ ya n'anya.
He knew he could not.	Ọ maara na ọ gaghị enwe ike.

Many people love us.	Ọtụtụ mmadụ hụrụ anyị.
They are very close, but so far.	Ha dị ezigbo nso, ma ruo ugbu a.
However, it does its small job.	Otú ọ dị, ọ na-arụ obere ọrụ ya.
They have the situation.	Ha nwere ọnọdụ ahụ.
Suddenly, he was free.	Na mberede, ọ nwere onwe ya.
It is a very powerful eye.	Ọ bụ anya dị ike nke ukwuu.
Sit down with them for lunch.	Gị na ha nọdụ na nri ehihie.
Here is what he said.	Nke a bụ ihe o kwuru.
This work is currently being done here.	A na-arụ ọrụ a n'oge a ebe a.
It has no place in this group.	O nweghị ebe ọ bụla na otu a.
But he began to think.	Ma ọ malitere iche echiche.
I have more problems here than you.	Enwere m nsogbu ebe a karịa gị.
How much does it cost?	Ego ọ na-eri.
He would not do such a thing.	Ọ gaghị eme ihe dị otú ahụ.
I think it will help.	Echere na ọ ga-enyere aka.
Most of the people who live there live there.	Ọtụtụ ndị bi n’ebe ahụ bi n’ebe ahụ.
He did not know what to do next.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ ga-eme ọzọ.
The effect is very positive.	Mmetụta ahụ dị mma nke ukwuu.
The car was a real threat to the city.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ bụ n'ezie ihe egwu nye obodo ahụ.
This should be easy, but my head is swimming.	Nke a kwesịrị ịdị mfe, mana isi m na-egwu mmiri.
We go to a different house for each study.	Anyị na-aga n'ụlọ dị iche maka ọmụmụ ihe ọ bụla.
A fire broke out in the woman's house	Ọkụ gbara n’ụlọ nwanyị ahụ
Get it.	Nweta.
It's a beautiful day today, isn't it?	Ọ bụ ụbọchị mara mma taa, ọ bụghị ya?
But not before he gave me a job.	Ma ọ bụghị tupu o nye m ọrụ.
Suddenly, he had a plan.	Na mberede, o nwere atụmatụ.
The drug made him sleepy.	Ọgwụ ahụ mere ka ụra na-atụ ya.
You have to do it, that is, if that is what you came for.	Ị ga-eme, ya bụ, ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ bụ ihe ị bịara.
It's just this.	Ọ bụ naanị a.
Still obvious, the little one had some plans for his brother.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ doro anya, onye nta ahụ nwere atụmatụ ụfọdụ maka nwanne ya nwoke.
They gave their money.	Ha nyere ego ha.
Thank you so much for giving.	Daalụ nke ukwuu maka inye.
He was alone in the room.	Ọ nọ naanị ya n'ime ụlọ.
Pregnancy is not good.	Ime ime adịghị mma.
He understood what he had done.	Ọ ghọtara ihe o mere.
The only thing that matters.	Naanị ihe dị mkpa.
That makes sense.	Nke ahụ mara ihe.
That started it.	Nke ahụ malitere ya.
But we should get out as soon as possible.	Ma anyị kwesịrị ịpụ ngwa ngwa o kwere mee.
Both companies perform this function.	Ụlọ ọrụ abụọ ahụ na-arụ ọrụ a.

Of course, that is not true.	Otú ọ dị, n'ezie, nke ahụ abụghị eziokwu.

He is very happy there.	Obi dị ya ezigbo ụtọ n’ebe ahụ.
Few people know the truth about him.	Ọ bụ mmadụ ole na ole maara nke bụ́ eziokwu banyere ya.
Often, any language will do it.	Ọtụtụ mgbe, asụsụ ọ bụla ga-eme ya.
Three people live in the same house.	Mmadụ atọ bi n'otu ụlọ.
You do everything anyone can in the situation.	Ị na-eme ihe niile onye ọ bụla nwere ike ime na ọnọdụ.
Local boats are not used for fishing.	Ejighị ụgbọ mmiri ndị dị n'ime obodo eme azụ azụ.

I know, this is not fair to say.	Ama m, nke a adịghị mma ikwu.
He said he was a celebrity.	O kwuru na ọ bụ onye ama ama.
He thought again.	O chere echiche ọzọ.
The moment of interest is when there is no one else.	Oge inwe mmasị bụ mgbe ọ nweghị onye ọzọ.

If not, that's a real problem.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị, nke ahụ bụ ezigbo nsogbu.
However, there was no food.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị nri ọ bụla.

Something bad was happening to him.	Ihe na-adịghị mma na-eme ya.
He wanted to do this on his own.	Ọ chọrọ ime nke a n'onwe ya.
And within several days.	Na n'ime ọtụtụ ụbọchị.
It's not scary, but something.	Ọ bụghị egwu, ma ihe.

That is, to this day.	Ya bụ, ruo taa.

The shoes hit him.	Akpụkpọ ụkwụ ahụ tụrụ ya ụkwụ.
He loves you more than his own life.	Ọ hụrụ gị n'anya karịa ndụ nke ya.

It is not possible to speak in a microphone.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume ikwu okwu n'ime igwe okwu.
You are right.	I kwuru eziokwu.
He wants to drive.	Ọ chọrọ ịnya ụgbọ ala.
Giving them a gift is a good thing.	Inye ha onyinye bụ ihe dị mma.

Doing the right thing can help.	Ime ihe dị mma nwere ike inye aka.
But it continued for a while.	Ma ọ gara n'ihu ruo nwa oge.

You are her husband.	Ị bụ di ya.

If they tell you again, it's funny.	Ọ bụrụ na ha agwa gị ya ọzọ, ọ na-atọ ọchị.

Of course, that makes sense.	N'ezie, nke ahụ nwere ezi uche.

These challenges are not just our study.	Ihe ịma aka ndị a abụghị naanị ọmụmụ ihe anyị.

Despite the circumstances, he met them.	N'agbanyeghị ọnọdụ chọrọ, ọ zutere ha.

He heard them well.	Ọ nụrụ ha nke ọma.
We thought we could play it.	Anyị chere na anyị nwere ike igwu egwu na ya.
He gave me responsibilities.	O nyere m ibu ọrụ.

So there is one before that.	Ya mere, e nwere otu tupu nke ahụ.

That makes things easier.	Nke ahụ na-eme ka ihe dị mfe.

It's not expensive, of course.	Ọ bụghị ọnụ, n'ezie.
That's true.	Nke ahụ bụ eziokwu.

But it is really a lie.	Mana ọ bụ ụgha n'ezie.
His mother will not go.	Nne ya agaghị aga.

Some play a lot of games, some play a few games.	Ụfọdụ na-egwu ọtụtụ egwuregwu, ụfọdụ ndị na-egwu egwuregwu ole na ole.

This is the first day of my new career.	Nke a bụ ụbọchị mbụ nke ọrụ ọhụrụ m.
Everything took only three minutes.	Ihe niile were naanị nkeji atọ.
That day was the same day.	Ụbọchị ahụ bụ otu ụdị ụbọchị ahụ.
He only has black shoes.	Naanị akpụkpọ ụkwụ ojii ka o nwere.
He will cook there.	Ọ ga-esi nri n'ebe ahụ.
Your father is on his way to the airport.	Nna gị si ọdụ ụgbọ elu na-aga.

But it will be so easy.	Ma ọ ga-adị mfe otú ahụ.

Of course, I would not want to be that man.	N'ezie, agaghị m achọ ịbụ nwoke ahụ.

He was amazed.	Ọ tụrụ ya n'anya.

It’s nice to be surrounded by celebrities.	Ọ dị mma ka ihu ndị a ma ama gbara ya gburugburu.
Land here is cheap.	Ala ebe a dị ọnụ ala.
He can call for help.	O nwere ike ịkpọ maka enyemaka.
Working conditions are critical.	Ọnọdụ ọrụ dị oke njọ.
The same is true of everyone else.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị onye ọ bụla ọzọ.
It is a long car but it is worth it.	Ọ bụ ogologo ụgbọala mana ọ bara uru.
Not my fault.	Ọ bụghị m kpatara.
It was two hours that he was feeling emotional.	Ọ bụ awa abụọ na ọ na-enwe mmetụta mmetụta uche.
We ate at my uncle's house.	Anyị na-eri nri n'ụlọ nwanne nna m.
It's hard boy.	O siri ike nwata.
The dress is not very comfortable.	Uwe ahụ adịghị mma nke ukwuu.
His word is law.	Okwu ya bụ iwu.
That is a question that has been asked many times.	Nke ahụ bụ ajụjụ a jụrụ ọtụtụ ugboro.

The question is whether other sailors are.	Ajụjụ bụ ma ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri ndị ọzọ ọ bụ.
Many people rejected him.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ jụrụ ya.
The second issue is a little bit about it.	Okwu nke abụọ bụ ntakịrị ihe gbasara ya.
Can you see it ?.	Ị nwere ike ịhụ ya?.
It's very simple, of course.	Ọ dị nnọọ mfe, n'ezie.
So there is another practice in this story.	Ya mere enwere omume ọzọ na akụkọ a.
I do not understand.	Aghọtaghị m ya.
He would never feel worse about his life.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ọ ga-enwe mmetụta ka njọ na ndụ ya.
His work is known for their honesty.	A ma ọrụ ya ama maka eziokwu ha.
Make some friends among the sailors.	Mee ụfọdụ ndị enyi n'ime ndị ọrụ ụgbọ mmiri.
They have so much to rest.	Ha nwere oke ahụ nke ukwuu ka ha wee zuru ike.
We could never have done that again.	Mgbe ọ bụla ọzọ anyị gaara eme otú ahụ.
They are here, the books.	Ha nọ ebe a ebe, akwụkwọ ndị ahụ.
But no one tried to do it.	Ma ọ dịghị onye gbalịrị ime ya.
I can move on.	Enwere m ike ịga n'ihu.
I hope it is not so.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
That is obvious.	Nke ahụ doro anya.

This song is about being who you want to be.	Egwu a gbasara ịbụ onye ị chọrọ.

She wanted a man's name.	Ọ chọrọ aha nwoke.
However, it does spread, as we know.	Otú ọ dị, ọ gbasara, dị ka anyị maara.
Still, it is possible.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, o kwere isi.
He ate lunch alone.	Naanị ya rie nri ehihie.

But the need is really for more than that.	Ma mkpa bụ n'ezie maka ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
It's about the person you care about.	Ọ bụ maka onye ị na-eche banyere ya.

And a lot of work went into this.	Na ọtụtụ ọrụ wee na nke a.
At first everything went smoothly.	Na mbụ ihe niile gara n'anya.
He looked around at them.	O lere ha anya gburugburu.
He feels that his wife is near.	Ọ dị ya ka nwunye ya nọ nso.
There may be a few things.	Enwere ike inwe ihe ole na ole.
Nothing should be said.	E kwesịghị ikwu ihe ọ bụla.

His eyes went elsewhere.	Anya ya gara ebe ọzọ.
I never understood.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m ghọtara.

But it would be good with it.	Mana ọ ga-adị mma na ya.
They think we have a long time.	Ha na-eche na anyị nwere ogologo oge.
He can see it working but he wonders how.	O nwere ike ịhụ na ọ na-arụ ọrụ ma ọ na-eche otú.
The father was a police officer.	Nna ahụ bụ onye uwe ojii.

In such cases, we think, it is.	Na ndị dị otú ahụ, anyị na-eche, ọ bụ.

So we got there and nothing was said.	Ya mere, anyị rutere ebe ahụ na ọ dịghị ihe e kwuru.
Whatever it will be, it will be.	Ihe ọ bụla ga-abụ, ọ ga-abụ.

One area he does frequently is in the workplace.	Otu ebe ọ na-eme ugboro ugboro bụ na ebe ọrụ.
The first one will be our family.	Nke mbụ ga-abụ ezinụlọ anyị.
He is in prison awaiting trial.	Ọ nọ n'ụlọ mkpọrọ na-eche ikpe.
Nothing is a problem on the road to our big day.	Ọ dịghị ihe bụ nsogbu na ụzọ ruo nnukwu ụbọchị anyị.

The car broke down.	Ụgbọ ala ahụ dara.
Everything else is a letter to ourselves.	Ihe ọ bụla ọzọ bụ akwụkwọ ozi nye onwe anyị.
Money matters.	Okwu ego.
They thought it was the worst.	Ha chere na ọ kacha njọ.

The reason for this behavior was the misconduct of the police.	Ihe kpatara omume a bụ omume ọjọọ ndị uwe ojii.

Of course, he did not know if every three days.	N'ezie, ọ maghị ma ọ bụla ụbọchị atọ.

However, there are problems here.	Otú ọ dị, n'ebe a, e nwere ọtụtụ nsogbu.

He looked at the situation objectively.	O lere ọnọdụ ahụ anya nke ọma.

He didn't seem to want to talk about it.	O yighị ka ọ chọghị ikwu banyere ya.

It does not require much thought.	Ọ dịghị achọ echiche dị ukwuu.
Those are the words.	Ihe ndị ahụ bụ okwu ya.
Given the distance, this trip should take about an hour.	Nyere ebe dị anya, njem a kwesịrị iwe ihe dị ka otu awa.

The cause is in the hands of the individual.	Ihe kpatara ya dị n'aka onye ahụ.
Did you really do your best, boy?	I mere ike gị n'ezie, nwa nwoke?
His suggestions are sound.	Aro ya bara uru.
He continued like this for several minutes.	Ọ gara n'ihu otú a ruo ọtụtụ nkeji.
But not as usual.	Ma ọ bụghị dị ka ọ dị na mbụ.
Without them, there is no message.	Na-enweghị ha, ọ dịghị ozi.
They try, but it doesn't work.	Ha na-agbalị, mana ọ naghị arụ ọrụ.
Our organization has a license that issued this order.	Nzukọ anyị nwere akwụkwọ ikike nke nyere iwu a.
I have it, by the way.	Enwere m ya, n'agbanyeghị.
Another powerful influence was the person we ate with.	Mmetụta ọzọ dị ike bụ onye anyị na ya na-eri nri.
Everything went well, everything went well.	Ihe niile gara nke ọma, ihe niile gara nke ọma.
She is only 30 years old.	Ọ dị naanị afọ iri atọ.
I doubt they would want to if they could.	Enwere m obi abụọ na ha ga-achọ ma ọ bụrụ na ha nwere ike.
Any tips will help.	Atụmatụ ọ bụla ga-enyere aka.
He still can.	Ọ ka nwere ike.
Like, one kind of reason.	Dị ka, otu ụdị ihe kpatara ya.
You have a new family, a new passion.	Ị nwere ezinụlọ ọhụrụ, mmasị ọhụrụ.
Others think so.	Ndị ọzọ chere otú ahụ.
I do not know how or when but it fell.	Amaghị ka esi ma ọ bụ mgbe mana ọ dara.
Then it was as he had expected.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ dị ka ọ tụrụ anya ya.
They do not want to play.	Ha achọghị igwu egwu.
But for him, this is not necessary.	Ma n'ebe ọ nọ, nke a adịghị mkpa.
It is impossible to do that.	Ọ gaghị ekwe omume ime nke ahụ.
It works for both of us.	Ọ na-arụ ọrụ maka anyị abụọ.
Could not find anything of the main building.	Enweghị ike ịhụ ihe ọ bụla nke isi ụlọ ahụ.
The baby could see them, but there were no tears.	O doro anya na nwa ọhụrụ ahụ pụrụ ịhụ ha, ma ọ dịghị akwa ákwá.
There is no law on this.	Enweghị iwu na ihe a.
You know there is a good reason for this.	Ị maara na e nwere ezigbo ihe kpatara nke a.
I am your thing.	A bụ m gị ihe.
The past year has fallen behind for many years.	Afọ gara aga dara azụ ọtụtụ afọ.
That is what the nation is doing.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe mba na-eme.
Almost everywhere one can find food.	Ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ebe niile mmadụ nwere ike ịhụ nri.
Four years.	Afọ anọ.
You can get the size you want.	Ị nwere ike nweta oke nke ịchọrọ.
I do not want to do that.	Achọghị m ime nke ahụ.
It is your job to be ready.	Ọ bụ ọrụ gị ka ị dị njikere.
And not in a practical way, either.	Ma ọ bụghị n'ụzọ bara uru, ma.
There may be good reasons.	O nwere ike ịbụ na o nwere ezigbo ihe kpatara ya.
Of course, there is a better life elsewhere.	N'ezie, enwere ndụ ka mma ebe ọzọ.
I don't know how that happened, but it did.	Amaghị m otú nke ahụ si mee, mana o nwere.
Her boyfriend was drinking.	Enyi ya nwoke na-aṅụ mmanya.
It's beautiful tonight.	Ọ mara mma n'abalị a.
Eating.	Na-eri ihe.
But he was right.	Ma o kwuru eziokwu.
I still need it.	M ka chọrọ ya.
You left my things alone, now.	Ị hapụrụ ihe m naanị, ugbu a.
I think that’s good, really fun.	Echere m na nke ahụ dị mma, na-atọ ụtọ nke ukwuu.
We continue to be good friends.	Anyị gara n'ihu bụrụ ezigbo enyi.
Great water.	Mmiri dị ukwuu.
Today he does it.	Taa ọ na-eme ya.
He should not say anything.	O kwesịghị ikwu ihe ọ bụla.
Tell your mother where you are going.	Gwa nne gị ebe ị na-aga.
There is some truth to that.	Ọ dị ụfọdụ eziokwu na nke ahụ.
The moonlight is bright.	Ọkụ dị n'ọnwa bụ agba agba.
He really hates school.	N'ezie, ọ kpọrọ ụlọ akwụkwọ asị.
Like my friend.	Dị ka enyi m.
We never say that.	Ọ dịghị mgbe anyị na-ekwu otú ahụ.
I look more like my father than my mother.	M yiri nna m karịa nne m.
Or it may not belong to him.	Ma ọ bụ nwere ike ọ gaghị abụ nke ya.
There are two different perspectives.	Enwere echiche abụọ dị iche iche.
He tried to call her to the hospital.	Ọ gbalịrị ịkpọ ya n'ụlọ ọgwụ.
Real life, eating.	Ịdị ndụ n'ezie, iri nri.
Most people are just interested.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ nwere mmasị naanị.
I was wondering what was the problem.	M nọ na-eche ihe bụ nsogbu ahụ.
Because he was afraid now.	N'ihi na ụjọ tụrụ ya ugbu a.
There is nothing you can do about it right now.	O nweghị ihe ị ga-eme maka ya ugbu a.
All or nothing, he said.	Ihe niile ma ọ bụ ihe ọ bụla, o kwuru.
He knows you are not what he wants you to be.	Ọ maara na ị bụghị ihe ọ chọrọ.
There is a rule for this matter.	Enwere iwu maka okwu a.
Popular place for seafood.	Ebe a ma ama maka nri mmiri.
He still does not understand who he is now.	Ọ ka aghọtaghị onye ọ bụ ugbu a.
But they are there.	Ma, ha nọ ebe ahụ.
Someone should tell you in front of me.	Mmadụ kwesịrị ịgwa gị n’ihu m.
There is so much to do.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe ime.
Everyone.	Onye ọ bụla.
They got awesome results.	Ha nwetara ihe ndị dị egwu.
For my work here.	Maka ọrụ m ebe a.
Which one really has.	Kedu nke n'ezie ọ nwere.
Good morning.	Ụtụtụ ụtụtụ kacha mma.
But it wasn't the worst thing that could have happened.	Ma ọ bụghị ihe kacha njọ gaara eme.
But only if you want to.	Ma naanị ma ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ.
Different games are everything.	Egwuregwu dị iche iche bụ ihe niile.
I pack my lunch when I was a kid.	Ana m akpa nri ehihie m mgbe m bụ nwata.
But it's a big game.	Mana ọ bụ nnukwu egwuregwu.
I looked closer.	M lere anya nso.
No one was surprised.	O nweghị onye ma ya tụrụ ya n’anya.
But it is again.	Ma ọ dị ọzọ.
But he thinks they will be his.	Ma o chere na ha ga-abụ nke ya.
We need such a man.	Anyị chọrọ nwoke dị otú ahụ.
She felt her mouth roll around her.	O nwere mmetụta ka ọnụ ya na-agba gburugburu ya.
He saw what had happened.	Ọ hụrụ ihe merenụ.
This is something we really know.	Nke a bụ ihe anyị maara n'ezie.
We have a family.	Anyị nwere ezinụlọ.
So he agreed.	N’ihi nke a, o kwere isi.
We live near a house.	Anyị bi n'akụkụ ụlọ.
That's really nice to see.	Nke ahụ dị mma n'ezie ịhụ.
But they are all very different.	Ma ha niile dị nnọọ iche.
He was in the same, he was told.	Ọ nọ na otu ahụ, a gwara ya.
He is there.	Ọ nọ n'ebe ahụ.
Maybe you like it very much.	Ma eleghị anya, na-amasị gị nke ukwuu.
They are so beautiful.	Ha mara mma nke ukwuu.
You want value for money.	Ị chọrọ uru maka ego.
I miss there.	A na m atụ uche ebe ahụ.
He has the right to be angry.	O nwere ikike iwe iwe.
As high as you can go.	Dị elu ka ị nwere ike ịga.
He was right.	O kwuru eziokwu.
Most people want you to succeed.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ chọrọ ka ị nwee ihe ịga nke ọma.
Please tell me.	Biko gwa m.
I am my own man.	Abụ m nwoke nke m.
We are just as bad as the people we talked about earlier.	Anyị dị nnọọ njọ dị ka ndị anyị na-ekwu banyere ya na mbụ.
There are two different problems.	Enwere nsogbu abụọ dị iche iche.
They are both small.	Ha abụọ dị obere.
I do not want you to play me in this round.	Achọghị m ka ị na-egwu m na nke a gburugburu.
He tried not to think about it.	Ọ gbalịrị ka ọ ghara ịdị na-eche banyere nke ahụ.
I have a feeling he feels.	Enwere m mmetụta ọ na-eche.
Most of them are children.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ha bụ ụmụaka.
This happened at the bus station.	Ihe a mere na ọdụ ụgbọ ala.
His car was not here when we arrived here.	Ụgbọala ya anọghị ebe a mgbe anyị rutere ebe a.
Tears well up in his eyes.	Anya mmiri nke ọma n'anya ya.
That would be hard.	Nke ahụ ga-esi ike.
I have strong legs.	Enwere m ụkwụ dị ike.
Some words are interesting here.	Okwu ụfọdụ na-atọ ụtọ ebe a.
That is who you are.	Nke ahụ bụ onye ị bụ.
I have a special opportunity.	M inwe ohere pụrụ iche.
Friends interested.	Ndị enyi nwere mmasị.
The plaintiff rejected this offer.	Onye gbara akwụkwọ jụrụ onyinye a.
However, the former is uncertain.	Otú ọ dị, nke mbụ ejighị n'aka.
Maybe he could get some interest.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ nwere ike nweta otu mmasị.
I look forward to our trip together.	Ana m atụ anya njem anyị ọnụ.
The story, however, is symbolic.	Otú ọ dị, akụkọ ahụ bụ ihe atụ.
Most people would like more than that.	Ọtụtụ ndị ga-achọ ihe karịrị nke ahụ.
You have a spirit.	Ị nwere mmụọ.
We only knew ourselves for a few weeks.	Naanị izu ole na ole ka anyị ji mara onwe anyị.
It is a beautiful place with many good friends.	Ọ bụ ebe mara mma nwere ndị bi na ya nwere ezigbo enyi.
It’s nice to see you up and down.	Ọ dị mma ịhụ gị na elu na elu.
Can't go far without them.	Enweghị ike ịga ebe dị anya na-enweghị ha.
History, of course, is one of them.	N'ezie, akụkọ ihe mere eme bụ otu n'ime ha.
I need to get out again in a minute.	Ekwesịrị m ịpụ ọzọ n'otu nkeji.
He does not like to travel.	Ọ naghị amasị ime njem.
I do not care about them.	Achọghị m ịma banyere ha.
I was very involved.	M tinyere aka nke ukwuu.
I want to go.	Achọrọ m ịla.
They are not like you.	Ha adịghị ka gị onwe gị.
I can do it myself.	Enwere m ike ime ya n'onwe m.
Now what will happen ?.	Ugbu a gịnị ga-eme?.
Let me know as you go with the new doctor.	Mee ka m mara ka ọ na-aga na dọkịta ọhụrụ ahụ.
None of this is true.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ihe ndị a bụ eziokwu.
In people's heads.	N'ime isi ndị mmadụ.
But everyone around her is really interested in everything.	Ma onye ọ bụla nọ ya gburugburu na-enwe mmasị n'ezie maka ihe niile.
Financial reports are available here.	Akụkọ gbasara ego dị ebe a.
Find us there.	Chọọ anyị ebe ahụ.
He knows exactly how to do that.	Ọ maara otú e si eme nke ahụ nke ọma.
They will want it more than they think.	Ha ga-achọ ya karịa ka ha chere.
He had nothing to do.	O nweghị ihe ọ ga-eme.
I try.	M na-agbalị.
His mouth is very wet.	Ọnụ ya dị oke mmiri.
She feels that she deserves it.	Ọ dị ya ka ihe kwesịrị ya.
She may be one of your children.	O nwere ike ịbụ otu n'ime ụmụ gị.
Continue whatever food they are given to be good.	Gaa n'ihu ihe ọ bụla e nyere ha nri ka ọ dị mma.
It's beautiful.	Ọ mara mma.
It's hard to say.	O siri ike ikwu okwu.
It will be a hot day.	Ọ ga-abụ ụbọchị ọkụ.
They only have each other.	Ha nwere naanị ibe ha.
However, it still does not work.	Mana, ọ ka naghị arụ ọrụ.
It is all now.	Ọ bụ ihe niile ugbu a.
This is not true.	Nke a abụghị eziokwu.
He was angry.	Iwe were ya.
I was really scared.	Ụjọ na-atụ m n'ezie.
However, no one can love him.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị onye pụrụ ịhụ ya n'anya.
The past is beyond me.	Ihe gara aga karịrị m.
We did it together.	Anyị mere ya ọnụ.
It makes sense to me.	O nwere uche m.
I love it so much.	M hụrụ n'anya nke ukwuu.
Maybe he does.	Ma eleghị anya ọ na-eme ya.
There is little more to do.	Ọ dị ntakịrị ihe ọzọ ime.
That is all.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe niile.
The water of the river was very low.	Mmiri nke osimiri ahụ dara nke ukwuu.
It can have many names.	O nwere ike inwe ọtụtụ aha.
So they looked at other countries.	Ya mere, ha lere anya na mba ndị ọzọ.
He is very angry.	Iwe were ya nke ukwuu.
We have many reasons why we do not do so now.	Anyị nwere ọtụtụ ihe mere na anyị emeghị otú ahụ ugbu a.
I feel like yours.	Enwere m mmetụta dị ka nke gị.
He did not know me.	Ọ maghị m.
But nothing like this is happening.	Ma ọ dịghị ihe dị ka nke a na-eme.
They started making breakfast.	Ha malitere ime nri ụtụtụ.
Small, anyway.	Obere, n'ụzọ ọ bụla.
It is most important.	Ọ kacha dị mkpa.
I saw this with my own eyes.	Ahụrụ m ihe a anya.
I was angry with myself.	Iwe were m onwe m.
No thoughts or ideas are small or insignificant.	Ọ nweghị echiche ma ọ bụ echiche dị obere ma ọ bụ enweghị isi.
I have a lot of things.	Enwere m ọtụtụ ihe.
His question is beautiful.	Ajụjụ ya mara mma.
He has a lot of money	O nwere nnukwu ego
It will most likely be my book of the year.	O yikarịrị ka ọ ga-abụ akwụkwọ nke afọ m.
I like going very much.	Ọ na-amasị m ịga nke ukwuu.
He looked into the distance.	O lere anya n'ebe dị anya.
You really do not need to worry.	N'ezie ọ dịghị mkpa ka ị na-enwe nsogbu.
And he wants it.	Na ọ chọrọ ya.
I think he was surprised.	Echere m na ọ tụrụ onwe ya n'anya.
I knew right away that she was the same woman.	Amaara m ozugbo na ọ bụ otu nwanyị ahụ.
I was alone.	Anọ m naanị ya.
Good idea, maybe.	Ezi echiche, ma eleghị anya.
Only now things will be different.	Naanị ugbu a ihe ga-adị iche.
I love it.	Ahụrụ m ya n'anya.
I think they did not.	Echere m na ha emeghị.
However, he had many close friends.	Otú ọ dị, o nwere ọtụtụ ezigbo ndị enyi.
But this does not happen.	Ma nke a adịghị eme.
The store collapsed.	Ụlọ ahịa ahụ dara.
Only one word was said.	Naanị otu okwu ka e kwuru.
He tried several times, but to no avail.	Ọ gbalịrị ọtụtụ ugboro, ma ọ dịghị ihe mere.
He can see it in her.	O nwere ike ịhụ ya n'ime ya.
But in this case, it is different.	Ma na nke a, ọ dị iche.
I am running.	Ana m agba ọsọ.
This is really one more country.	Nke a bụ n'ezie otu ihe ọzọ mba.
I do not know if you will come.	Amaghị m ma ị ga-abịa.
I hope this makes sense.	Enwere m olileanya na nke a nwere ezi uche.
Some of it is coming.	Ụfọdụ n'ime ya na-abịa.
No one is interested.	Ọ dịghị onye nwere mmasị.
They found him and talked to him.	Ha hụrụ ya ma gwa ya okwu.
Many years of hard times.	Ọtụtụ afọ nke oge siri ike.
If I can get that day back.	Ọ bụrụ na m nwere ike nweta ụbọchị ahụ azụ.
She looked at him intently.	O lere ya anya nke ukwuu.
He drank heavily.	Ọ were nnukwu mmanya ọzọ.
I was surprised.	O juru m anya.
All years of dancing as a child, he thought.	Afọ niile nke ịgba egwu mgbe ọ bụ nwata, o chere.
He spoke well of the boy.	O kwuru nke ọma banyere nwata.
Others can tell us all about it.	Ndị ọzọ nwere ike ịgwa anyị ihe ahụ niile.
The two minutes seem like years.	Nkeji abụọ ahụ yiri ya ka afọ.
Your time with me can be long either.	Oge gị na nke m nwere ike ịdị ogologo ma.
No more.	Ọ dịghị ọzọ ọzọ.
The only thing he looked back on.	Naanị ihe ọ lere anya azụ.
Thank you so much for making my day a really good meal.	Daalụ nke ukwuu o mere ka ụbọchị m nweta ezigbo nri.
He rested in his arms.	O zuru ike n'aka ya.
I'm glad he liked it.	Enwere m obi ụtọ na ọ nwere mmasị na ya.
She would help find his father.	Ọ ga-enyere aka ịchọta nna ya.
I really can.	Enwere m ike n'ezie.
But it is awesome.	Ma ọ dị egwu.
Until then, there is nothing you can do.	Ruo mgbe ahụ, ọ nweghị ihe ị ga-eme.
The road has beautiful trees.	Ụzọ ahụ nwere osisi mara mma.
This is so delicious.	Nke a dị nnọọ ụtọ.
But his eyes.	Ma anya ya.
It tastes good.	Ọ dị ka ụtọ.
I know he was right.	Ama m na o kwuru eziokwu.
They were given an opportunity to speak at the meeting.	E nyere ha ohere ikwu okwu na nzukọ ahụ.
He told everyone to get out of the house.	Ọ gwara onye ọ bụla ka ha pụọ ​​n'ime ụlọ.
It is perfect.	O zuru oke.
Now permission.	Ugbu a ikike.
It is difficult to do everything.	O siri ike ime ihe niile.
But there seems to be something wrong with it.	Ma ọ dị ka ọ̀ dị ihe na-adịghị mma.
There are no words and no mind.	Enweghị okwu na uche.
Her parents left last year.	Nne na nna ya hapụrụ afọ gara aga.
I do not want to make this trip.	Achọghị m ime njem a.
He looked around the room.	Ọ lere anya n'ọnụ ụlọ gbara ya gburugburu.
Those things are important for this group.	Ihe ndị ahụ dị mkpa maka otu a.
He arrived early in the morning for the interview.	O rutere n'isi ụtụtụ maka ajụjụ ọnụ ahụ.
They know all about that.	Ha maara ihe niile banyere nke ahụ.
Get a book.	Nweta akwụkwọ.
These drugs are not safe.	Ọgwụ ndị a adịghị mma.
This is the message to our customers.	Nke a bụ ozi nye ndị ahịa anyị.

He asked where they were.	Ọ jụrụ ebe ha nọ.
My sister is a vegetarian.	Nwanne m nwanyị bụ onye anaghị eri anụ.

This time, it was a dead dog.	Oge a, ọ bụ nkịta nwụrụ anwụ.
I am not ready for this.	Adịghị m njikere maka nke a.
For me, she wanted to live again.	Nye m, ọ na-achọ ịdị ndụ ọzọ.
However, you will not see that.	Otú ọ dị, ị gaghị ahụ nke ahụ.
That was the last rest.	Nke ahụ bụ izu ike ikpeazụ.
The store was packed.	Ndị mmadụ juru ụlọ ahịa ahụ.
Try but we do not know how to help us.	Gbalịrị ma anyị amaghị ka anyị ga-esi nyere anyị aka.
It was not the only way to help me and my baby.	Ọ bụghị naanị ụzọ isi nyere mụ na nwa ọhụrụ aka.

Students met near the playground.	Ụmụ akwụkwọ zutere n'akụkụ ebe egwuregwu.

In fact, she is very much afraid of him.	N'ezie, ọ tụrụ ya egwu nke ukwuu.
I would love to see more.	Enwere m mmasị ịhụ ihe ndị ọzọ.
That is why.	Ọ bụ ya kpatara ya.
Will it be done?	A ga-eme ya?
Of course, it is very simple.	N'ezie, ọ dị nnọọ mfe.
You have someone else by your side.	Ị nwere onye ọzọ n'akụkụ gị.
There is no history.	Enweghị akụkọ ihe mere eme.
The latter is very important.	Nke ikpeazụ ahụ dị ezigbo mkpa.

Every child has a bad day.	Nwa ọ bụla nwere ụbọchị ọjọọ.
Still, he knows.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, ọ maara.
Maybe you know his name.	Ma eleghị anya ị ma aha ya.
You told me that the first day we met.	Ị gwara m na ụbọchị mbụ anyị zutere.
The ship entered the harbor	Ụgbọ mmiri ahụ banyere n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ
You can do this in two ways.	Ị nwere ike ime nke a n'ụzọ abụọ.
One task should do only one thing.	Otu ọrụ kwesịrị ime naanị otu ihe.
What did you say?	Kedu ihe i kwuru?
You know the rules.	Ị maara iwu.
And you are a.	Na ị bụ a.
The truth of the books is uncertain.	Eziokwu nke akwụkwọ ndị ahụ ejighị n'aka.
It is not.	Ọ bụghị.
This restaurant offers local food.	Ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ a nyere nri obodo.
Then an idea came to me.	Mgbe ahụ, otu echiche bịara m.
I am the only one who can tell her about this.	Ọ bụ m naanị ya nwere ike ịgwa ya gbasara nke a.
That is what we do.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe anyị na-eme.

You have great friends.	Ị nwere nnukwu ndị enyi.
Of course this would be a better place.	N'ezie na nke a ga-abụ ebe ka mma.
But again, this is not our case.	Ma ọzọ, nke a abụghị ikpe anyị.
Its effects are not unique.	Mmetụta ya abụghị ihe pụrụ iche.
Travel is not that easy.	Njem na-adịghị mfe otú ahụ.

He felt guilty and responsible.	Obi ama ama ya ikpe na ibu ọrụ.
There is not much else to do.	Ọ dịghị ọtụtụ ihe ọzọ ime.
It was the only opportunity we had.	Ọ bụ naanị ohere anyị nwere.

He does not seem to see the future.	Ọ dị ka ọ naghị ahụ oge na-aga n'ihu.
He could not eat well.	Ọ nweghị ike iri nri nke ọma.
You take these medicines before meals.	Ị na-aṅụ ọgwụ ndị a tupu nri.
He thinks he is safe.	O chere na o nweghị ihe ọjọọ ga-eme ya.

The story is entertaining in the film.	Akụkọ ahụ nwere obi ụtọ na ihe nkiri ahụ.
That’s a big deal right now.	Nke ahụ bụ nnukwu ihe ugbu a.
He said do it, but not tomorrow.	Ọ sị mee ya, ma ọ bụghị echi.
We are the people.	Anyị bụ ndị mmadụ.
He talked about ideas, types, jobs.	O kwuru banyere echiche, ụdị, ọrụ.
This is a game.	Nke a bụ egwuregwu.
Maybe they are.	Ma eleghị anya, ha bụ.
I will help him.	M ga-enyere ya aka.
That's what a soccer team does.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe otu bọọlụ na-eme.
You are more human than you know.	Ị bụ mmadụ karịa ka ị maara.
Obviously not.	N'ụzọ doro anya, ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
There is nothing better than that.	Ọ dịghị mma karịa nke ahụ.
He may see that things are not right.	O nwere ike ịhụ na ihe adịghị mma.
They got it going.	Ha nwetara ya na-aga.
This should not be a bad thing.	Nke a ekwesịghị ịbụ ihe ọjọọ.
However, the truth is hard.	Otú ọ dị, eziokwu siri ike.
It's the same all together.	Ọ bụ otu niile ọnụ.
Well, there are a few archers in this movie.	Ọ dị mma, enwere ndị na-agba ụta ole na ole na ihe nkiri a.
I need to tell my children.	M kwesịrị ịgwa ụmụ m.

There may be a way.	Enwere ike inwe ụzọ.
None of them are new.	Ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n'ime ha dị ọhụrụ.
I never wanted any of this problem.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m chọrọ nke ọ bụla nke nsogbu a.
That is what is to come.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe ọ ga-abịa.
He tried to make things better.	Ọ gbalịrị ime ka ihe ka mma.
Or at least help me not to get too good at it again.	Ma ọ bụ ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, nyere m aka ka m ghara ịma nke ọma ọzọ.
It is the only language you speak.	Ọ bụ naanị asụsụ ị na-asụ.

Of course there is a third.	N'ezie enwere nke atọ.
Maybe it is.	Ma eleghị anya ọ bụ.
It speaks of everything.	Ọ na-ekwu maka ihe niile.
They did not act as fast as they could.	Ha emeghị ngwa ngwa ka ha nwere ike.
Absolutely, actually seeing it twice today.	Zuru oke, n'ezie ịhụ ya ugboro abụọ taa.
He seemed to be thinking	O yiri ka ọ nọ na-eche echiche
Now he is gone.	Ugbu a ọ pụọ.
He looked around the house.	O lere anya gburugburu ụlọ.
There's a letter, baby.	Enwere akwụkwọ ozi, nwa.
The doctors told her to rest.	Ndị dọkịta gwara ya ka ọ zuru ike.
The problem is another.	Nsogbu bụ ọzọ.
You can tell me anything.	Ị nwere ike ịgwa m ihe ọ bụla.
I need a driver.	Achọrọ m onye ịnya ụgbọ ala.
On foot, it can take up to a week.	Na ụkwụ, ọ nwere ike were otu izu.

Of course the difference is true.	N'ezie ihe dị iche bụ eziokwu.
I don't want anything.	Achọghị m ihe ọ bụla .
No human makes or can speak as he does.	Ọ dịghị mmadụ mere ma ọ bụ nwee ike ikwu okwu otú o si eme.
Let's take these things one at a time.	Ka anyị were ihe ndị a n'otu n'otu.
They like not to work.	Ha nwere mmasị na ha agaghị arụ ọrụ.
I love the story.	Ahụrụ m akụkọ ahụ n'anya.
Everyone wants it.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ ya.
He does the stupid thing all the time.	Ọ na-eme ihe nzuzu ahụ mgbe niile.
I really think this is the only way.	Echere m n'ezie na nke a bụ naanị ụzọ.
Here, the word is pretty good.	N'ebe a, okwu a mara ezigbo mma.
When did this happen?	Olee mgbe nke a mere?
Your appearance is beautiful.	Ụdị gị mara mma.
He was there, of course.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ, n'ezie.
I’m not sure anyone else can.	Ejighị m n'aka na onye ọ bụla ọzọ nwere ike.
My message is clear.	Ozi m doro anya.

Now, it is very important.	Ugbu a, dị oke mkpa.
The idea is negative.	Echiche ahụ adịghị mma.
Nothing serious.	Ọ dịghị mkpa.
No, he can't.	Mba nke ukwuu, ọ nweghị ike.
He had a great final game.	O nwere nnukwu egwuregwu egwuregwu ikpeazụ.
Awesome thing.	Ihe dị egwu.
This is awesome.	Nke a dị oke egwu.

No apology required.	Enweghị mgbaghara achọrọ.
You can not go on like this.	Ị nweghị ike ịga n'ihu otu a.

The basement is wet and unattractive.	Ụlọ ala ahụ dị mmiri mmiri na enweghị mmasị.

Many of these have relatives.	Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị a nwere ndị ikwu.

When not in trouble, good visual effects.	Mgbe ọ bụghị na nsogbu, ezigbo anya mmetụta.
They want the money.	Ha chọrọ ego ahụ.
That is very wrong.	Nke ahụ bụ nnọọ ihe ọjọọ.
Sometimes the fighting stopped.	Mgbe ụfọdụ, ọgụ ahụ kwụsịrị.
He regularly ate vegetables in his diet.	Ọ na-eri akwụkwọ nri mgbe niile na nri ya.
The second time around is very influential.	Oge nke abụọ gburugburu na-enwe mmetụta nke ukwuu.
It looks like this.	Ọ dị ka nke a.
This is done in one of two ways.	A na-eme nke a n'otu n'ime ụzọ abụọ.
He would have died, simply.	Ọ gaara anwụ, n'ụzọ dị mfe.
I told him there was nothing he could do.	Agwara m ya na ọ dịghị ihe ọ ga-eme.
I'm not happy.	Enweghị m obi ụtọ.
It is in every human being, without meaning.	Ọ bụ n'ime mmadụ ọ bụla, na-enweghị isi.
They like the ground.	Ha nwere mmasị na ala.
Cooking is a personal matter.	Isi nri bụ ihe onwe.
The guilty boys cried.	Ụmụ ụmụ nwoke ahụ a mara ikpe mara ibe ákwá.
This was the last time he saw his father alive.	Nke a bụ oge ikpeazụ ọ hụrụ nna ya ka ọ dị ndụ.
But there are limits to the country.	Ma enwere oke na mba.
Family friendly and beautiful.	Ezinụlọ enyi na enyi mara mma.
This is a big house.	Nke a bụ nnukwu ụlọ.
What you get is a reasonable one.	Ihe ị nwetara bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya.
He is scared.	Ụjọ juru ya.
I had a room service last night.	Enwere m ọrụ ime ụlọ n'abalị ụnyaahụ.

Not a good idea on the plant.	Enweghị ezigbo echiche na osisi.

Maybe this is an example.	Ma eleghị anya, nke a bụ ihe atụ.
I'm sure you believe everything you say.	Eji m n’aka na i kwere ihe niile ị na-ekwu.
Then it stopped as a sudden.	Mgbe ahụ, ọ kwụsịrị dị ka na mberede.
This only happened occasionally.	Nke a mere naanị mgbe ụfọdụ.
Of course something has.	N'ezie ihe nwere.
But you have.	Ma ị nwere.
The second day was not good.	Ụbọchị nke abụọ adịghị mma.

You can help us with this project.	Ị nwere ike inyere anyị aka na ọrụ a.

Of course not.	N'ezie ọ bụghị.

At this time.	N'oge a.
It will continue.	Ọ ga-aga n'ihu.

Lots of cars on the way.	Ọtụtụ ụgbọ ala n'ụzọ.
He is my friend.	Ọ bụ enyi m.
I'll tell you.	Aga m agwa gị.
Everything is clearer to you than the others.	Ihe niile doro gị anya karịa ndị ọzọ.
The way of things.	Ụzọ nke ihe.
They just don’t have time for us.	Naanị ha enweghị oge maka anyị.
Let me tell you, this thing works.	Ka m gwa gị, ihe a na-arụ ọrụ.
I hope he is still alive.	Enwere m olileanya na ọ ka dị ndụ.
Many women in this town are happy at home.	Ọtụtụ ụmụ nwanyị na obodo a na-enwe obi ụtọ n'ụlọ.
He did not know what to do next.	Ọ maghị ihe ọzọ ọ ga-eme.
He doesn't seem to be able to drive.	Ọ dị ka ọ nweghị ike ịnya ụgbọ ala.
The behavior is unique.	Omume ahụ pụrụ iche.
There is more space now than ever before.	Enwere ohere ugbu a karịa ka ọ dị na mbụ.
None of us can go home now.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị nwere ike ịla ụlọ ugbu a.
There is no green to talk about.	Enweghị akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ ikwu maka ya.
Maybe he's a man.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ bụ nwoke.
But he said it was not his job.	Mana o kwuru na ọ bụghị ọrụ ya.
A car was stolen.	E zuru otu ụgbọ ala.
So tell me this.	Ya mere gwa m ihe a.
The doctor watched as he went.	Dọkịta ahụ lere ya anya ka ọ na-aga.
This idea came true.	Echiche a wee bụrụ eziokwu.
No one comes.	Ọ dịghị onye na-abịa.
We all know that nothing will happen.	Anyị niile maara na ọ nweghị ihe ga-eme.
Humorous things you think at the worst of times.	Ihe ọchị ihe ị na-eche n'oge kacha njọ.
It can still happen.	Ọ ka nwere ike ime.
It's more than in the past.	Ọ bụ karịa site n'oge gara aga.
His life, the lives of his children, where they went and where they went.	Ndụ ya, ndụ ụmụ ya, ebe ha gara na ebe ha na-aga.
He looked out the window.	O lere anya na windo.
Clearly something is happening.	O doro anya na ihe na-eme.
This gift arrives today!	Onyinye a rutere taa!
But you love it.	Ma ị hụrụ ya n'anya.
These cars have only three wheels.	Ụgbọ ala ndị a nwere naanị ụkwụ atọ.
Do you want to go to town?	Ị chọrọ ịga obodo?
The staff was helpful and friendly.	Ndị ọrụ ahụ nyere aka na enyi.

This is the new model.	Nke a bụ ụdị ọhụrụ ahụ.
Twenty-one son.	Nwa nwoke nke iri abụọ na otu.
I do not know what is the problem here.	Amaghị m ihe bụ nsogbu ebe a.
This is not his room.	Nke a abụghị ọnụ ụlọ ya.
She looked at him.	O lere ya anya n’anya.
They are pointless.	Ha enweghị isi.
It was my fault that he died.	Ọ bụ m kpatara na ọ nwụrụ.
I never did.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m mere.
The next step is to move to another city.	Ihe ọzọ m ga-eme bụ ịga obodo ọzọ.
In some ways that is different.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ nke ahụ dị iche.
No more problems.	Enweghị nsogbu ndị ọzọ.
They like you if you like them.	Ha na-amasị gị ma ọ bụrụ na-amasị gị.
This is a small town not far from here.	Nke a bụ obere obodo na-adịghị anya site na ebe a.
So it was there early in the morning.	Ya mere, ọ dị ebe ahụ n'isi ụtụtụ.
The bag is expensive.	Akpa ahụ dị oke ọnụ.

I know he has no idea.	Ama m na o nweghị echiche pụrụ iche.
But there is a big problem.	Ma enwere nnukwu nsogbu.
He will look for you, wherever you go.	Ọ ga-achọ gị, ebe ọ bụla ị na-aga.
It's too scary.	Ọ dị oke egwu nke ukwuu.
Suddenly, I was scared.	Ụjọ tụrụ m na mberede.
The need is urgent, they said.	Mkpa dị ngwa ngwa, ha kwuru.
The weather is uncertain.	Ihu igwe ejighị n'aka.
So stay close to me.	Ya mere, nọrọ m nso.
Just go there.	Naanị aga ebe ahụ.
We are going back a long way.	Anyị na-aga azụ ogologo ụzọ.
However, you are still young.	Otú ọ dị, ị ka dị obere.
Because it is true.	N'ihi na ọ bụ eziokwu.
We can go somewhere.	Anyị nwere ike ịga ebe.
If it makes you feel bad, it's not good.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ na-eme gị obi ọjọọ, ọ na-adịghị mma.
The mother was terrified of her son's behavior.	Nne ahụ tụrụ ụjọ maka omume nwa ya nwoke.
They do not die.	Ha anaghị anwụ anwụ.
More than anything he wants to get away with.	Karịa ihe ọ bụla ọ chọrọ ka ọ pụọ.
The problem is his body.	Nsogbu bụ ahụ ya.
They don't seem to care.	Ọ dị ka ha enweghị mmasị.
But not in this house.	Ma ọ bụghị n'ụlọ a.
Nothing like this.	Ọ dịghị ihe dị ka nke a.
A few more minutes.	Nkeji ole na ole ọzọ.
The reader runs on time.	Onye na-agụ akwụkwọ na-agba ọsọ n'oge.
But you have the feeling.	Ma, ị nwere mmetụta.
I will do this every day.	M ga-eme nke a kwa ụbọchị.
We can not believe that this is a matter of law.	Anyị enweghị ike ikweta na nke a bụ ihe gbasara iwu.
The machines work great.	Igwe ndị ahụ na-arụ ọrụ nke ukwuu.
But that's not the case.	Ma ọ bụghị nke ahụ.
There are many opportunities.	Enwere ọtụtụ ohere.
They arrived at the airport.	Ha rutere n'ọdụ ụgbọ elu.
There is a market not far from here.	Enwere ahịa adịghị anya site na ebe a.
You do not know us.	Ị maghị anyị.
But it is a different situation, with no question.	Ma ọ bụ ọnọdụ dị iche, na enweghị ajụjụ.
It tastes good, but it would be great.	Ọ na-atọ ụtọ, mana ọ ga-abụ nke ukwuu.
He did not know.	Ọ maghị ihe.
The back room is the school.	Ụlọ dị n'azụ bụ ụlọ akwụkwọ.

His story is about one person.	Akụkọ ya gbasara otu onye.
In time, the fear subsided.	Ka oge na-aga, ụjọ ahụ kwụsịrị.
That's there.	Nke ahụ ebe ahụ.
Colors can be used for a variety of purposes.	Enwere ike iji agba mee ihe dị iche iche.
Not my mother, but not my brother.	Ọ bụghị nne m, ma ọ bụghị nwanne m nwoke.
You will not need anything else.	Ị gaghị achọ ihe ọ bụla ọzọ.

Because that's what my mother was.	N'ihi na ọ bụ ihe nne m bụ.
Well, what's new there?	Ọ dị mma, kedu ihe dị ọhụrụ ebe ahụ.
This city is known for its high unemployment rate.	A maara obodo a maka nnukwu enweghị ọrụ.
This turned out to be something else.	Nke a mechara bụrụ ihe ọzọ.
Everyone heard it.	Onye ọ bụla nụrụ ya.

The example is of two men.	Ihe atụ a bụ ụmụ nwoke abụọ.
However, he never really did.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị mgbe o mere otú ahụ n'ezie.
It sounds like anger.	Ọ dị ka iwe.
Obviously, the value should be as small as possible.	N'ụzọ doro anya, uru kwesịrị ịdị ntakịrị ka o kwere mee.
She loves her son so much.	Ọ hụrụ oke egwu nwa ya nwoke.
He suggests that you be well aware that this will happen.	Ọ tụrụ aro ka ị mara nke ọma na nke a ga-eme.

One might say that it is recommended.	Mmadụ nwere ike ikwu na a na-atụ aro ya.

Not by themselves, that is.	Ọ bụghị n'onwe ha, ya bụ.

I am not as strong as they say.	Adịghị m ike dị ka ha na-ekwu.

There is no room for it here.	O nweghị ohere maka ya ebe a.
Most people like to run.	Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ na-enwe mmasị ịgba ọsọ.
No need for medication.	Ọ dịghị mkpa maka ọgwụ.
Now he has his own rules.	Ugbu a o nwere iwu nke ya.

He has none.	O nweghị nke ọ bụla.
Not that it matters now.	Ọ bụghị na ọ dị mkpa ugbu a.
Let us not hate one another.	Ka anyị ghara ịkpọ ibe anyị asị.

His hand left his head.	Aka ya hapụrụ isi ya.

So I work all day.	Ya mere m na-arụ ọrụ na ụbọchị niile.
I don't talk to anyone.	Anaghị m agwa onye ọ bụla okwu.
I'm honest, though.	Adị m eziokwu, n'agbanyeghị.
What we need to do now is to take action.	Ihe anyị kwesịrị ime ugbu a bụ ime ihe.
We do not have to be perfect.	Anyị ekwesịghị izu oke.
Perfect mind is a good mind.	Uche zuru oke bụ uche dị mma.
We can see how that goes.	Anyị nwere ike ịhụ ka nke ahụ si aga.
However, I did not sleep well.	Otú ọ dị, ụra adịghị m mma.
Obviously this is not a problem.	O doro anya na nke a abụghị nsogbu.
He knew where to look.	Ọ maara ebe ọ ga-achọ ya.
The girls only loved it at school.	Ụmụ agbọghọ ahụ hụrụ ya n'anya naanị n'ụlọ akwụkwọ.
One task is not better than the other.	Otu ọrụ adịghị mma karịa nke ọzọ.
So give yourself time.	Ya mere, nye onwe gị oge.
The idea is very simple.	Echiche dị nnọọ mfe.

The moon is as big tonight.	Ọnwa dị ka nnukwu n'abalị a.

Unfortunately, this will not happen.	Ọ bụ ihe nwute na nke a agaghị eme.
However, more important now is what is on my mind.	Otú ọ dị, nke ka mkpa ugbu a bụ ihe na-eme m n'obi.
The doctor was furious.	Iwe were dọkịta ahụ nke ukwuu.
This is a very important book.	Nke a bụ akwụkwọ dị ezigbo mkpa.
We bought it.	Anyị zụtara ya.
Small, if anything.	Obere, ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla.
That was the first thing we tried.	Nke ahụ bụ ihe mbụ anyị gbalịrị.
Companies can use their employees to do whatever they want.	Ndị ụlọ ọrụ nwere ike iji ndị ọrụ ha mee ihe masịrị ha.
There is no cure for it.	Enweghị ọgwụ maka ya.
Tears welled up in his eyes.	Anya mmiri juru ya ihu.
One of the reasons is the following.	Otu n'ime ihe kpatara ya bụ ihe ndị a.
What a beautiful thing that happened.	Ihe mara mma bụ ihe merenụ.
He was there, photographed and everything.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ, foto na ihe niile.
He came here for the first time this summer during the holidays.	Ọ bịara ebe a nke mbụ n'oge okpomọkụ n'oge ezumike.

This is true.	Nke a bụ eziokwu.

Her parents were not happy.	Obi adịghị ndị mụrụ ya ụtọ.

That is good news and bad news.	Nke ahụ bụ ozi ọma na akụkọ ọjọọ.

We can go to any story he wants.	Anyị nwere ike ịga na akụkọ ọ bụla ọ chọrọ.
Let’s keep it simple.	Ka anyị mee ka ọ dị mfe.
He is a real person and a special person.	Ọ bụ onye dị ndụ n'ezie na onye pụrụ iche.
They are different in circumstances.	Ha dị iche na ọnọdụ.
The reason is good.	Ihe kpatara ya bụ nke ọma.
There is so much to fear here.	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe na egwu ebe a.
He is wise.	Ọ maara ihe.
He may feel like it coming.	O nwere ike ịdị ya ka ọ na-abịa.
I am not afraid of disease.	Anaghị m atụ egwu ọrịa.
Not breakfast.	Ọ bụghị nri ụtụtụ.
They seem to be afraid of him.	O yiri ka ha na-atụ ya ụjọ.
I think in their own way they did.	Echere m na n'ụzọ nke aka ha ka ha mere.
Maybe here.	Enwere ike n'ebe a.
It's like a spirit.	Ọ dị ka mmụọ.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
We fell in love so much.	Anyị dara n'anya nke ukwuu.
I'm not good at that.	Adịghị m mma na nke ahụ.
Only time can tell what will happen.	Naanị oge nwere ike ịgwa ihe ga-eme.
He drove the car, wondering how he was.	O gbara ụgbọ ala, na-eche ka o si bụrụ nwoke a.
I felt my mother’s feelings.	Enwere m mmetụta nke nne m.
It would have been a pretty funny story.	Ọ gaara abụ akụkọ na-atọ ọchị mara mma.
It's bad.	Ọ dị njọ.
Friends of the family were included.	E tinyere ndị enyi ezinụlọ ahụ.
I think she is really beautiful with a perfect body.	Echere m na ọ mara mma n'ezie nke nwere ahụ zuru oke.
Tell me something else.	Gwa m ihe ọzọ.
All types of transportation will be available.	Ụdị ụgbọ njem niile ga-adị.
Take just a few minutes.	Were naanị nkeji ole na ole.
I will not be there.	Agaghị m anọ ebe ahụ.
A new day is coming.	Ụbọchị ọhụrụ na-abịa.
I can’t do it on my own.	Enweghị m ike ime ya n'onwe m.
Many of them were sent to prison.	A kpọrọ ọtụtụ n'ime ha mkpọrọ.
Many false stories were told.	E mere ọtụtụ akụkọ ụgha.
I'm pretty good.	Enwere m ezigbo mma.
Maybe they will.	Ma eleghị anya, ha ga-eme.
We know it only by the name of the environment here.	Anyị maara ya naanị site na aha gburugburu ebe a.
However, he does nothing.	Otú ọ dị, ọ dịghị eme ihe ọ bụla.
You are stronger than you think.	Ị dị ike karịa ka ị chere.
Maybe he liked it back.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ masịrị ya azụ.
I did not find anything.	Ahụghị m ihe ọ bụla.
The water is running high.	Mmiri a na-agba agba.
Transportation can be in any direction.	Ụgbọ njem nwere ike ịdị n'akụkụ ọ bụla.
That is the problem.	Nke ahụ bụ nsogbu.
But this is only true to one point.	Mana nke a bụ naanị eziokwu ruo otu isi.
It will look like it.	Ọ ga-adị ka ọ.
There, head down.	N'ebe ahụ, isi ala.
He did well for a while.	O mere nke ọma nwa oge.
The patient quickly lost weight.	Onye ọrịa ahụ kwụsịrị ibu ngwa ngwa.
Of wood.	Nke osisi.
Now give us the money.	Ugbu a, nye anyị ego ahụ.
This is a beloved man.	Nke a bụ nwoke a hụrụ n'anya.
And the promises are in them.	Na nkwa dị n'ime ha.
I know again.	M maara ọzọ.
I know, the idea is awesome.	Ama m, echiche dị egwu.
Suddenly, everyone in front of me stopped.	Na mberede, onye ọ bụla nọ n'ihu m kwụsịrị.
According to his ability.	Dị ka ikike ya.
Are you going to swim?	Ị ga-aga igwu mmiri?
In this case.	Na nke.
They are very nice and very friendly.	Ha mara ezigbo mma na ezigbo enyi.
He thought it was good.	O chere na ọ dị mma.
You have to do this every day.	Ị ga-eme nke a kwa ụbọchị.
Sometimes these things happen.	Mgbe ụfọdụ ihe ndị a na-eme.
What they say is false.	Ihe ha na-ekwu bụ ụgha.
It happened.	O mere.
Wise people happen and can tell me.	Ndị maara ihe na-eme ma nwee ike ịgwa m.
It's not easy.	Ọ dịghị mfe.
There are two of them.	E nwere abụọ n'ime ha.
But how? 	Ma olee otú?
It's very good.	Ọ dị nnọọ mma.
Or information.	Ma ọ bụ ozi.
We admire his strength.	Ike ya masịrị anyị.
It's tough.	Ọ bụ nke siri ike.
Once you get used to it you can see it for yourself.	Ozugbo, ị ga-eji ya ị nwere ike ịhụ ya n'onwe gị.
He talks about my dad, too.	Ọ na-ekwu ihe banyere nna m, kwa.
This is a dictatorial rule, he said.	Nke a bụ iwu aka ike, o kwuru.
That works well, but it's a big job.	Nke ahụ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma, mana ọ bụ nnukwu ọrụ.
Their last meeting was a success.	Nzukọ ikpeazụ ha gara nke ọma.
They are beautiful.	Ha mara mma.
To the right of the new type of these little wines.	N'aka nri ọhụrụ ụdị nke obere mmanya ndị a.
It is not the same terrible situation.	Ọ bụghị otu egwu egwu ọnọdụ ahụ.
For many years, the country bought coffee from other countries.	Ruo ọtụtụ afọ, mba a zụtara kọfị kọfị ná mba ọzọ.
And again, if necessary.	Na ọzọ, ma ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mkpa.
The weather is bad.	Ihu igwe adịghị mma.
I want to be.	Achọrọ m ịbụ ya.
None of us know exactly what each other is going through.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị pụrụ ịma nke ọma ihe onye ọ bụla ọzọ na-enwe.
There was no police presence.	O nweghị onye uwe ojii nọ n'ihu.
Now go to work.	Ugbu a gaa ọrụ.
Someone was waiting for him.	Mmadụ nọ na-eche ya.
They will stay that way for several weeks.	Ha ga-anọ ọtụtụ izu otu ahụ.
We did both.	Anyị mere ha abụọ.
Take this medicine.	Were ọgwụ a.
Not indoors, or out of it.	Ọ bụghị n'ime ụlọ, ma ọ bụ pụọ na ya.
The couple has four children.	Di na nwunye ahụ nwere ụmụ anọ.
I think it was his heart.	Echere m na ọ bụ obi ya.
He had his meetings with two.	O nwere nzukọ ya na abụọ.
Everyone is interested in it.	Onye ọ bụla nwere mmasị na ya.
It is easy to assume that they have no education.	Ọ dị mfe iche na ha enweghị akwụkwọ.
Of course, it is wrong.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ihe ọjọọ.
But it will not be that easy.	Ma ọ gaghị adị mfe otú ahụ.
The story will have an important event.	Akụkọ ahụ ga-enwe ihe omume dị mkpa.
Please, it is not it please, it is not.	Biko, ọ bụghị ya biko, ọ bụghị ya.
But no one cared.	Ma, ọ dịghị onye chọrọ ịma.
We should value one another.	Anyị kwesịrị iji ibe anyị kpọrọ ihe.

I have the same issue.	Enwere m otu okwu ahụ.
I think there is something you need from me.	Echere m na ọ nwere ihe ị chọrọ n'aka m.
However, this feast has a short life.	Otú ọ dị, oriri a nwere obere ndụ.
There is something you need to know.	O nwere ihe i kwesịrị ịma.
There is so much to do!	Enwere ọtụtụ ihe ime!
And children.	Na ụmụaka.
There are many benefits to this.	Enwere ọtụtụ uru na nke a.
Apparently one of the two.	O doro anya na otu n'ime abụọ ahụ.
I wonder if any here.	M na-eche ma ọ bụla ebe a.

It's that simple.	Ọ bụ nke ahụ dị mfe.
There are others here recently.	Enwere ndị ọzọ ebe a na nso nso a.
Not really a house.	Ọ bụghị ụlọ n'ezie.

Good thing.	Ihe dị mma.
Not too high, not too low.	Ọ bụghị oke elu, ọ bụghị oke ala.
None of us have.	Ọ dịghị onye n'ime anyị nwere.
But they are not.	Ma ha adịghị ka.
Family dinner can be great.	Nri abalị ezinụlọ nwere ike ịbụ nke ukwuu.
His friend likely did not.	O yiri ka enyi ya emeghị otú ahụ.
It is a really beautiful place.	Ọ bụ ebe mara mma n'ezie.
He died within minutes.	Ọ nwụrụ n'ime nkeji ole na ole.
It is good and bad.	Ọ dị mma na adịghị mma.
Today, conditions are very different.	Taa, ọnọdụ dị nnọọ iche.
How well he looked that night.	Otú o si hụ nke ọma n’abalị ahụ.
Worth the money but not cheap.	Kwesịrị ego mana ọ bụghị ọnụ ala.
An example can be seen on the right.	Enwere ike ịhụ ihe atụ n'aka nri.
Trying to find his way.	Na-agbalị ịchọta ụzọ ya.
And in the last few years, by my wife.	Na n'ime afọ ole na ole gara aga, site na nwunye m.
Not bad, easy to use, and good for this guy.	Ọ bụghị ihe ọjọọ, dị mfe iji, ma dị mma maka nwoke a.
It is not difficult.	Ọ bụghị ihe siri ike.
One should not be in a hurry for this.	Mmadụ ekwesịghị ịdị ngwa ngwa maka nke a.
The chief and his father are very similar.	Onye isi na nna ya yiri nnọọ.
It is only for my own benefit.	Ọ bụ naanị maka uru nke m.
Sure, it is, but it is more than that.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ya, mana ọ karịrị nke ahụ.
That is his job.	Nke ahụ bụ ọrụ ya.
His life is just as good.	Ndụ ya dị nnọọ ka ọ dị mma.
No one really knows what he will do.	Ọ dịghị onye maara n'ezie ihe ọ ga-eme.
Or you made your own family.	Ma ọ bụ ị mere ezinụlọ nke gị.
There are many types of capital.	Enwere ọtụtụ ụdị isi obodo.
So we need everyone.	Ya mere, anyị chọrọ onye ọ bụla.
You fear for your life, but you are not alone.	Ị na-atụ egwu ndụ gị, ma ọ bụghị naanị gị.
We left on our own.	Anyị hapụrụ n'onwe anyị.
Believe me, you will want it.	Kwere m, ị ga-achọ ya.
They invited their friends over for dinner.	Ha kpọrọ ndị enyi ha rie nri abalị.

Talking about the past is hard.	Ikwu banyere oge gara aga siri ike.

He eventually went.	O mechara gaa ya.
I will go in about a week.	Aga m aga ihe dị ka otu izu.
Nothing like that happened.	Ọ nweghị ụdị ihe ahụ mere.
If he leaves, he can buy himself time.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ pụọ, o nwere ike zụtara onwe ya oge.
No fighting.	Ọ dịghị ọgụ.
He wondered how it was.	Ọ nọ na-eche otú ọ dị.
Not much.	Ọ bụghị nnukwu.
The case is serious.	Ikpe ahụ siri ike.
Not cheap but cheaper than service.	Ọ bụghị ọnụ ala mana dị ọnụ ala karịa ọrụ.
Only their names I know.	Naanị aha ha ka m maara.
He would be a doctor, a good job.	Ọ ga-abụ dọkịta, ezigbo ọrụ.
But this is not the case.	Ma ọ bụghị nke a.
There is a holiday in my life.	Enwere ezumike na ndụ m.
Makes you wonder who got it from this.	Na-eme ka ị na-eche onye nwetara site na nke a.
These are small points, though.	Ndị a bụ obere isi ihe, n'agbanyeghị.
There was no other chance.	O nweghị ohere ọzọ.
There are these people talking.	E nwere ndị a na-ekwu okwu.
Now he does not want to play at all.	Ugbu a, ọ chọghị igwu egwu ma ọlị.
But it felt like age.	Ma ọ dị ya ka afọ.
We thought we were that good.	Anyị chere na anyị dị mma otú ahụ.
We fear the worst.	Anyị na-atụ egwu nke kacha njọ.
I continued as before.	M gara n'ihu ka ọ dị na mbụ.
It feels like a big deal.	Ọ dị m ka nnukwu ihe.
They got it right.	Ha nwetara ya nke ọma.
Which is.	Nke bụ.
But you make your own.	Ma ị na-eme nke gị.
However, you would have seen me.	Otú ọ dị, ị gaara ahụ m.
Because it matters how much money people make.	N'ihi na ọ dị mkpa ego ole ndị mmadụ na-eme.
I like to cook.	esi nri na-amasị m.
I'll see my husband.	Aga m ahụ di m.
The country is facing a number of challenges.	Mba ahụ na-eche ọtụtụ nsogbu ihu.
I think it's funny.	Echere m na ọ bụ ihe ọchị.
And you have to be that way.	Na ị ga-abụ nke ahụ.
But the problems still exist.	Ma nsogbu ndị ahụ ka dị.
At this point, the page is.	N'oge a, ibe dị.
I would like any help in this regard.	Ọ ga-amasị m enyemaka ọ bụla na nke a.
This city has a big house.	Obodo a nwere nnukwu ụlọ.
One can not.	Otu enweghị ike.
Let's take a break.	Ka anyị were ntakịrị izu ike.
Of your place.	Nke ebe gị.
But it is very important.	Ma ọ dị ezigbo mkpa.
I do not see much.	Ahụghị m nke ukwuu.
Provide assistance to clients with problems.	Nye ndị ahịa nwere nsogbu enyemaka aka.
Second hand.	Aka nke abụọ.
In a way, that is certainly true.	N'otu ụzọ, nke ahụ doro anya bụ eziokwu.
At least, believe me.	Ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ, kwere m.
I know something is wrong.	Amaara m na ọ dị ihe adịghị mma.
We wondered what they were doing.	Anyị nọ na-eche ihe ha na-eme.
I was terrified of doing anything.	Ụjọ tụrụ m nke ukwuu ime ihe ọ bụla.
I like staying home.	Ọ na-amasị m ịnọ n'ụlọ.
The benefits for men are obvious.	Uru maka ụmụ nwoke doro anya.
You were made for each other.	E mere unu abụọ maka ibe unu.
Others doubt that they can.	Ndị ọzọ na-enwe obi abụọ na ha nwere ike.
If you really want to do it yourself.	Ọ bụrụ n'ezie na ị chọrọ ime onwe gị.
Illness started.	Ọrịa malitere.
It was in his mouth.	Ọ bụ n'ọnụ ya.
Probably not so good.	Eleghị anya ọ bụghị nke ọma.
I try as before.	M na-agbalị dị ka iso.
There are a few questions.	Enwere ajụjụ ole na ole.
This case has none.	Ikpe a enweghị nke ọ bụla.
Their parents are happy, but their children are not.	Obi dị ndị mụrụ ha ụtọ, ma ụmụ ha adịghị eme ya.
These are my people.	Ndị a bụ ndị m.
Maybe someone with a big advantage.	Ma eleghị anya, onye nwere nnukwu uru.
Or, for that matter, our community.	Ma ọ bụ, maka okwu ahụ, obodo anyị.
To be alone.	Iji bụrụ naanị.
The only thing that can happen.	Naanị ihe nwere ike ime.
He made the game his own and the place his own.	O mere egwuregwu ahụ nke ya na ebe ahụ nke ya.
There are three types of food.	Enwere ụdị nri atọ.
They never have the power of man.	Ọ dịghị mgbe ha na-enwe ike mmadụ.
You see what happened the next day.	Ị hụrụ ihe mere ụbọchị ọzọ.
Color is not very important.	Agba adịghị mkpa nke ukwuu.
Certainly not scary at all.	N'ezie, ọ bụghị egwu ma ọlị.
It's going to happen.	Ọ na-aga ime.
There is a family with children.	E nwere ezinụlọ nwere ụmụ.
The water is hot!	Mmiri ahụ dị ọkụ!
These problems are very serious.	Nsogbu ndị a dị nnọọ njọ.
Clearly work has a positive impact on it.	O doro anya na ọrụ nwere mmetụta dị mma banyere ya.
Four patients died from the disease.	Ndị ọrịa anọ nwụrụ n'ihi ọrịa ahụ.
She is your mother.	Ọ bụ nne gị.
I really know this works.	Amaara m n'ezie na nke a na-arụ ọrụ.
Just as cheap.	Dị ka ọ dị ọnụ ala.
It is worth driving.	Ọ bara uru ịnya ụgbọ ala ahụ.
I could never live without it.	Ọ dịghị mgbe m gaara adị ndụ ma ọ́ bụghị ya.
Not since lunch yesterday.	Ọ bụghị kemgbe nri ehihie ụnyaahụ.
Everything as possible.	Ihe niile dị ka o kwere mee.
She is beautiful now.	Ọ mara mma ugbu a.
Staying close to your family.	Ịnọ na ezinụlọ gị nso.
We can talk about this all night if you want.	Anyị nwere ike ikwu maka nke a abalị niile ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ.
I don't want it now.	Achọghị m ugbu a.
That took a lot of work.	Nke ahụ were ọtụtụ ọrụ.
Only these rules.	Ọ bụ naanị iwu ndị a.
It's like a drug.	Ọ dị ka ọgwụ ọjọọ.
I can’t get it, too.	Enweghị m ike ị nweta ya, ya.
Let's not get upset either.	Ka anyị ghara iwe iwe ma.
You will be fine, not the other way around.	Ị ga-adị m mma, ọ bụghị n'ụzọ ọzọ.
Maybe it scared me.	Ma eleghị anya, ọ tụrụ m ụjọ.
Very different, if anything.	Dị nnọọ iche, ma ọ bụrụ na ihe ọ bụla.
He enjoys every minute of it.	Ọ na-atọ ya ụtọ kwa nkeji ya.
And you do not know, until you know.	Ma ị maghị, ruo mgbe ị maara.
He was completely convinced he would not go.	O nwere uche zuru oke na ọ gaghị aga.
It's not just so bad here.	Ọ bụghị naanị ya mere ihe ọjọọ ebe a.
It would be nice.	Ọ ga-adị mma.
So I think that kind of success is for me.	Ya mere echere m na ụdị ihe ịga nke ọma dị otú ahụ maka m.
And of course they are.	Na n'ezie ha bụ.
It's just a pity.	Ọ bụ naanị ihe nwute.
Everyone wants something from him.	Onye ọ bụla chọrọ ihe n'aka ya.
But, again, probably not.	Ma, ọzọ, eleghị anya ọ bụghị.
I was impressed by the beauty of the dress.	Ịma mma nke uwe ahụ masịrị m.
It's stupid.	Ọ bụ nzuzu.
It's like that.	Ọ dị ka nke ahụ.
Has a drink and wine.	Nwere ihe ọṅụṅụ na mmanya.
I need to leave this house for a while.	Ekwesịrị m ịpụ n'ụlọ a nwa oge.
It's cold.	Ọ dị ka oyi.
In some ways, it does not seem so.	N'ụzọ ụfọdụ, o yighị ka ọ dị mkpa.
No, not you.	Mba, ọ bụghị gị.
But it continues.	Ma ọ na-aga n'ihu.
I can see some living things in it.	Enwere m ike ịhụ ụfọdụ ihe ndụ ndụ ndụ na ya.
If not, who knows.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị, onye maara.
He saw it from a distance.	Ọ hụrụ ya n'ebe dị anya.
He allowed it.	O kwere ya.
It was about noon.	Ọ bụ ihe dị ka ehihie.
It's perfect.	Ọ bụ ihe zuru oke.
So all of this sounds good to me.	N’ihi ya, ihe a niile yiri m ozi ọma.
And this book is really fun.	Na akwụkwọ a na-atọ ụtọ n'ezie.
Who is speaking?	Onye na-ekwu okwu?
But there is no problem with that.	Ma enweghị nsogbu na nke ahụ.
She knew him well in her life.	Ọ maara ya nke ukwuu ná ndụ ya.
It was a long, long trip.	Ọ bụ ogologo njem dị ogologo.
It is a great city in history.	Ọ bụ nnukwu obodo na akụkọ ihe mere eme.
For some reason, this book is different.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ, akwụkwọ a dị iche.
These two seem to work together.	Abụọ ndị a yiri ka ha abụọ na-arụ ọrụ.
We had a great time.	Anyị nwere ezigbo oge.
I don’t want you to make me feel.	Achọghị m ka i mee ka m nwee mmetụta.
Let me give a recent example.	Ka m nye ihe atụ nke nso nso a.
He asked them if they liked anything.	Ọ jụrụ ha ma ọ̀ dị ihe na-amasị ha.
There is a good reason for this rule.	Enwere ezi ihe kpatara iwu a.
They are expensive.	Ha dị oke ọnụ.
He is with them now.	Ya na ha nọ ugbu a.
I think those are the best.	Echere m na ndị ahụ bụ ihe kacha mma.
His only child was my father.	Otu nwa o nwere bụ nna m.
That's the way it is.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dị.
They said.	Ha kwuru.
The weather this morning was quite different.	Ihu igwe n'ụtụtụ ahụ dị nnọọ iche.
Not so.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ.
Hard working time.	Oge ọrụ siri ike.
We do not want any of our own.	Anyị achọghị nke ọ bụla nke anyị.
He thinks there is something wrong.	Ọ na-eche na ọ dị ihe na-adịghị mma.
I always thought that was funny.	M na-eche mgbe niile na nke ahụ bụ ihe na-atọ ọchị.
No help required.	Enyemaka achọrọ adịghị.
He is very busy.	O ji nnọọ ọrụ n'aka.
But in some ways, nothing more.	Ma n'ụzọ ụfọdụ, ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ.
He wants them to do it in some way.	Ọ chọrọ n'ụzọ ụfọdụ ka ha mee ya.
And secondly, you can.	Na nke abụọ, ị nwere ike.
How he knew he didn't know.	Otú o si mara na ọ maghị.
We are not in any financial trouble.	Anyị anọghị na nsogbu ego ọ bụla.
The story is two-sided.	Akụkọ ahụ dị n'akụkụ abụọ.
He is by our side.	Ọ nọ n'akụkụ anyị.
I met him.	M zutere ya.
You are right.	I kwuru eziokwu.
Everything in his store is so beautiful.	Ihe niile dị n'ụlọ ahịa ya mara mma nke ukwuu.
He is there now.	Ọ nọ ebe ahụ ugbu a.
It was for his life.	Ọ bụ ya maka ndụ ya.
One and the other.	Onye na ndị ọzọ.
Our school is in trouble.	Ụlọ akwụkwọ anyị nọ ná nsogbu.
It looks like you.	Ọ dị ka gị.
But some rules work well, but some don’t.	Ma ụfọdụ iwu na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma, ma ụfọdụ adịghị.
How was your day today?	Kedu ka ụbọchị gị mere taa?
Inside is empty, without is inside.	N'ime bụ enweghị, na-enweghị bụ n'ime.
It is the same word for "fight".	Ọ bụ otu okwu maka "ọgụ".
I mean, this is it.	Echere m, nke a bụ.
He does not like water.	Mmiri adịghị ya mma.
Another important thing you need is.	Ihe ọzọ dị mkpa ị chọrọ bụ.
All is well.	Ihe niile dị mma.
Possibly not an authority.	O kwere omume abụghị ikike.
Do it every week.	Na-eme kwa izu.
I can not believe it is true.	Apụghị m ikweta na ọ bụ eziokwu.
But we are not.	Ma anyị adịghị.
But those are not.	Ma ndị ahụ abụghị.
This is not good for many reasons.	Nke a adịghị mma maka ọtụtụ ihe kpatara ya.
It is our responsibility to please others.	Ọ bụ ọrụ anyị ime ndị ọzọ obi ụtọ.
I love you so much, really and so much.	Ahụrụ m gị n'anya nke ukwuu, n'ezie na nke ukwuu.
Most people do not.	Ọtụtụ ndị anaghị eme ya.
At first, the problem was that you really liked the game.	Na mbụ, nsogbu bụ na egwuregwu ahụ masịrị gị nke ukwuu.
There is no easy way to get what you really want.	Ọ nweghị ụzọ dị mfe iji nweta ihe ị chọrọ n'ezie.
In ancient times, doctors were chefs.	N'oge ochie, ndị dọkịta bụ ndị isi nri.
Maybe only two of that.	Ma eleghị anya naanị abụọ na nke ahụ.
Many doctors are skeptical but are in debt.	Ọtụtụ ndị dọkịta nwere obi abụọ mana ha ji ụgwọ.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	O yiri iwe.
Man is a monkey.	Mmadụ bụ enwe.
This is what his father tried to tell him.	Nke a bụ ihe nna ya gbalịrị ịgwa ya.
There is something here for everyone.	Enwere ihe ebe a maka onye ọ bụla.
This court does not have such jurisdiction.	Ụlọ ikpe a enweghị ikike dị otú ahụ.
That's how he did it.	Otú ahụ ka o si mee ya.
Still, something is seriously wrong.	N'agbanyeghị nke ahụ, e nwere ihe dị nnọọ njọ na-eme.
I know you're not gay.	Ama m na ị bụghị nwoke nwere mmasị nwoke.
Every place is different.	Ebe niile dị iche iche.
He said he was successful.	O kwuru na ọ gara nke ọma.
Maybe they thought it was weak because of it.	Ma eleghị anya, ha chere na ọ dịghị ike n'ihi ya.

He says what he knows.	Ọ na-ekwu ihe ọ maara.
The question is when.	Ajụjụ bụ mgbe.
Its story will not appeal to all readers.	Akụkọ ya agaghị amasị ndị niile na-agụ ya.
Whatever it is, it is not food.	Ihe ọ bụla ọ bụ, ọ bụghị nri.
At home.	N'ụlọ.
It is very important at this time.	Ọ dị ezigbo mkpa n'oge a.
That is not the case.	Ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka o si mee.

There are two main reasons.	E nwere isi ihe abụọ.

This is not mine.	Nke a abụghị nke m.
This woman is wise.	Nwanyị a mara ihe.
Not the person she wanted to be.	Ọ bụghị onye ọ chọrọ ịbụ.

We are a family.	Anyị bụ ezinụlọ.
His film was a huge success.	Ihe nkiri ya bụ nnukwu ihe ịga nke ọma.
They leave in fear.	Ha ji ụjọ pụọ.
I can’t take this for granted.	Enweghị m ike iji onwe m anya nke a.

To make them happy.	Ọ bụ ime ka ha nwee obi ụtọ.

But they are not necessary at this time.	Mana ha adịghị mkpa n'oge a.

This can happen at any time.	Nke a nwere ike ime n'oge ọ bụla.
And many benefits can still be used today.	Na ọtụtụ uru ka nwere ike iji taa.
It should not be more then personal.	O kwesịghị ịbụ ndị ọzọ na mgbe ahụ onwe.
I almost succeeded but one thing.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka m nwee ihe ịga nke ọma ma otu ihe.
There is no danger there.	Enweghị ihe egwu dị ebe ahụ.
He saw her as a man.	Ọ hụrụ ya ka nwoke.
He started for the old road, then stopped.	Ọ malitere n'ihu maka ụzọ ochie, wee kwụsị.
This is our mother.	Nke a bụ nne anyị.

This is a great opportunity.	Nke a bụ nnukwu ohere.
Everyone said he had my face.	Onye ọ bụla kwuru na o nwere ihu m.

We need to talk.	Anyị kwesịrị ikwu okwu.

For now, that is.	Maka ugbu a, ya bụ.
In this way, the work progresses faster.	N'ụzọ dị otú a, ọrụ na-aga n'ihu ngwa ngwa.
Of course, it is his favorite.	N'ezie, ọ bụ ya kacha amasị.
That was a very important interview.	Nke ahụ bụ ajụjụ ọnụ dị mkpa n'ezie.
I looked around his face.	M lere anya n'akụkụ ihu ya.

We have to do it every day.	Anyị ga-eme ya kwa ụbọchị.
He came that day.	Ọ bịara ụbọchị ahụ.
She looked at him intently.	O lere ya anya nke ukwuu.
He is in trouble.	Ọ nọ ná nsogbu.
It is a good place.	Ọ bụ ebe dị mma.
He was still young and famous.	Ọ ka bụ nwata ma bụrụ onye a ma ama.
And you are alone.	Na ị bụ naanị.
It's just that we don't do it well.	Ọ bụ naanị na anyị anaghị eme ya nke ọma.
Special, but not that bad.	Pụrụ iche, mana ọ bụghị na adịghị mma.
Do things at home.	Na-eme ihe n'ụlọ.
We saw it, you saw it.	Anyị hụrụ ya, ị hụrụ ya.
Obviously things are not right.	O doro anya na ihe adịghị mma.
But the opposite is true too.	Ma, nke dị iche bụ eziokwu kwa.
However, her husband did.	Otú ọ dị, di ya mere otú ahụ.
If you know you are suffering.	Ọ bụrụ na ị maara na ị nwere ahụhụ.

So you should really be concerned about that.	N'ihi ya, i kwesịrị ịdị adị n'ezie banyere nke ahụ.

Not in any way, not always.	Ọ bụghị n'ụzọ ọ bụla, ọ bụghị mgbe ọ bụla.
They love it so much.	Ha hụrụ ya nke ukwuu.
But something very different happened.	Ma ihe dị nnọọ iche mere.

This can be seen as follows.	Enwere ike ịhụ nke a dị ka ndị a.
I am happy to give it to her.	Obi dị m ụtọ inye ya ya.
However, school books are something else.	Otú ọ dị, akwụkwọ ụlọ akwụkwọ bụ ihe ọzọ.
This weekend will be tough.	Izu ụka a ga-esi ike.
Thank you for your help.	Daalụ m maka enyemaka gị.

It is one of the main reasons why we love our home.	Ọ bụ otu n'ime isi ihe mere anyị ji hụ ụlọ anyị n'anya.
Everyone is successful.	Onye ọ bụla bụ ihe ịga nke ọma.
This should not take long.	Nke a ekwesịghị iwe ogologo oge.
He did not know what to do with them all.	Ọ maghị ihe ọ ga-eji ha niile mee.
Again, just my opinion.	Ọzọ, naanị echiche m.
His mother is simple about it.	Nne ya dị mfe banyere ya.
Probably a lot.	Ma eleghị anya, ọtụtụ.
Drugs are not our business.	Ọgwụ ọjọọ abụghị ọrụ anyị.
Just stay in front of it.	Naanị nọrọ n'ihu ya.
Obviously, that failed.	O doro anya na nke ahụ dara.
He does not seem to be afraid.	Ọ dị ka ọ naghị atụ egwu.
We cannot do much on our own.	Anyị enweghị ike ime ihe dị ukwuu n'onwe anyị.
That is no different from lying.	Ọ dịghị otú nke ahụ dị iche na ụgha.
But he thought carefully about it.	Ma o chere nke ọma banyere ya.
It will be fine now.	Ọ ga-adị mma ugbu a.
He did it three times.	O mere ya ugboro atọ.
I love you, boy.	Ahụrụ m gị n'anya, nwa nwoke.
He thought he was another boy.	O chere na ya bụ nwata ọzọ.
The room was like a sudden fire.	Ime ụlọ ahụ dị ka ọkụ na mberede.
What matters is what you do about the problem.	Ihe dị mkpa bụ ihe ị na-eme maka nsogbu ahụ.
They all look like big men.	Ha niile yiri oke nwoke.
He wants to be on the right side of history.	Ọ chọrọ ịnọ n'akụkụ aka nri nke akụkọ ihe mere eme.
Winter is the worst time.	Oge oyi bụ oge kacha njọ.
He’s his friend, it seems.	Ọ bụ enyi ya, ọ dị ka.

They look like perfect friends.	Ha yiri enyi zuru oke.
When he was a year old, he was about twenty years old.	Mgbe ọ dị afọ, ọ dị ihe dị ka afọ iri abụọ.
The trip took four hours.	Njem ahụ were awa anọ.
They both look like brothers and sisters.	Ha abụọ dị ka nwanne nwoke na nwanne nwanyị.

However, things soon got better for her.	Otú ọ dị, ihe bịara ka mma ozugbo ọ malitere ịga ụlọ akwụkwọ.

For some reason, we were traveling together.	N'ihi ihe ụfọdụ, anyị na-aga njem ọnụ.

Should think about it first.	Kwesịrị iche banyere ya mbụ.

He won’t tell you anything bad about himself, really.	Ọ gaghị agwa gị ihe ọ bụla dị njọ banyere onwe ya, n'ezie.
This city is known as a music venue.	A maara obodo a dị ka ebe egwu egwu.

He was making a special impression on us.	Ọ nọ na-eme ka anyị nwee mmetụta pụrụ iche.

He may not see anything.	O nwere ike ọ gaghị ahụ ihe ọ bụla.

Whatever you think is irrelevant.	Ihe ọ bụla ị chere adịghị mkpa.
The point is, he wants me to do it.	Isi ihe bụ na ọ chọrọ ka m mee ya.
Maybe I was three or four years old.	Ma eleghị anya, adị m afọ atọ ma ọ bụ anọ.

But she seems to enjoy the challenge.	Ma o yiri ka ihe ịma aka ahụ ọ̀ na-atọ ya ụtọ.
Some of these questions are as follows.	Ụfọdụ ajụjụ ndị a bụ ndị a.
