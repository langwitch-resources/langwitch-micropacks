If you can't think of more songs, write one.	Idan ba za ku iya tunanin ƙarin waƙa ba, rubuta ɗaya.
More than a week, gradually increase the time outside.	Fiye da mako guda, ƙara lokacin waje a hankali.
This will help with happiness.	Wannan zai taimaka da farin ciki.
Not more than he did.	Bai fi yadda ya yi ba.
I want to get out of there, quickly.	Ina so in tashi daga can, da sauri.
Work continued rapidly.	Aiki ya ci gaba da sauri.
It is very useful not to be.	Yana da matukar amfani kada ya kasance.
You do not want to be told you can not do anything.	Ba ka son a gaya maka ba za ka iya yin wani abu ba.
I have to look at it myself.	Dole ne in kalli hakan da kaina.
I understand completely.	Na gane gaba daya.
Think about why this is happening.	Ka yi tunanin dalilin da ya sa hakan ke faruwa.
If you work with me, things like this will never happen again.	Idan kun yi aiki tare da ni, abubuwa irin wannan ba za su sake faruwa ba.
We feel comfortable.	Muna jin dadi.
I had never seen that and I was very surprised.	Ban taɓa ganin haka ba kuma na yi mamaki sosai.
Maybe even before he called her.	Watakila tun kafin ya kira ta.
I see someone like you.	Ina ganin wani kamar ku.
To me, that doesn't work.	A gare ni, hakan ba ya aiki.
Something good in the evil world.	Wani abu mai kyau a cikin mummunan duniya.
Why do we use this.	Me yasa muke amfani da wannan.
What this pain is doing to him.	Abin da wannan mai zafi yake yi masa.
We cannot see the future.	Ba za mu iya gani a nan gaba ba.
It can be totally.	Yana iya gaba ɗaya.
Do it.	Yi haka.
I am thinking of getting married.	Ina tunanin yin aure.
Something went up.	Wani abu ya daga.
I do not want to be here on my own.	Ba na son zama a nan da kaina.
Like she doesn't know you.	Kamar ba ta san ku ba.
She will do the job.	Za ta yi wannan aiki.
Of course they are.	Tabbas suna.
They are good in the palace, but not much used otherwise.	Suna da kyau a cikin fada, amma ba amfani da yawa in ba haka ba.
I have never done this before.	Ban taba yin wannan a baya ba.
And it looks like there will be more problems if you release us.	Kuma da alama za a sami ƙarin matsala idan kun sake mu.
Absolutely amazing speech.	Lallai ban mamaki magana.
I'm tired of doing that.	Na gaji da yin hakan.
Clever with it.	Mai hankali da shi.
She can eat regularly.	Zata iya cin abinci kullum.
I am not the person you think.	Ni ba mutumin da kuke tunani ba.
Many have died since then.	Mutane da yawa sun mutu tun daga lokacin.
I see through you immediately.	Na ga ta wurin ku nan da nan.
It felt good.	An ji daɗin farin ciki.
Like the rest of the morning.	Kamar sauran safe.
That we grew up.	Cewa mun girma.
That could explain it.	Wannan zai iya bayyana shi.
He took them to work.	Ya kai su wurin aiki.
He is coming when he comes.	Yana zuwa idan ya zo.
Who is not you.	Wanda ba ku.
No one played the game.	Babu wanda ya yi wasan.
It would be nice to see the truth.	Zai yi kyau a ga gaskiya.
We can't find out who he is.	Ba za mu iya gano ko wanene shi ba.
He walks, swims, and runs.	Yana tafiya, ya yi iyo, ya gudu.
The previous day.	A ranar da ta gabata.
I could not understand what was going on there.	Na kasa gane abin da ke faruwa a wurin.
I feel very sick.	Ina jin rashin lafiya sosai.
We went out to eat and have lunch on the same day.	Mun fita cin abinci da abincin rana a rana guda.
The look surprised him.	Kallon ya ba shi mamaki.
However, time was running out.	Duk da haka, lokaci ya yi da kyau.
Hope it will work.	Da fatan za a yi aiki.
It's not very good.	Ba shi da kyau sosai.
That's it we still see some.	Shi ke nan har yanzu muna ga wasu.
Get it for a walk, though.	Samun shi don tafiya, ko da yake.
That's what it was done.	Abin da aka yi shi ke nan.
Yet it will.	Amma duk da haka zai.
You have to win.	Dole ne ku yi nasara.
Fast food is fast.	Abincin sauri yana da sauri.
This made it difficult for him to hear.	Hakan ya sa shi wahala ko da ya ji.
We want it too.	Mu ma muna so.
I'm sad	Ina bakin ciki
You need to know what to do when you hear something.	Kuna buƙatar sanin abin da za ku yi idan kun ji wani abu.
I'm just glad you can have the time.	Na yi farin ciki kawai kuna iya samun lokacin.
This is something we need to change.	Wannan wani abu ne da muke bukatar mu canza.
The program is here.	Shirin yana nan.
So we all agree.	Don haka duk mun yarda.
You just have to complete this task.	Dole ne kawai ku gama wannan aikin.
He knew as she told him.	Ya sani kamar yadda ta fada masa.
He, too, was wrong.	Shi ma bai yi daidai ba.
Only two kind suited me.	Biyu kawai irin dace da ni.
Talk a lot.	Yi magana da yawa.
I am here to stay.	Ina nan zan tsaya.
I want to look a little bit, you see.	Ina so in duba kadan kadan, ka gani.
He added another.	Ya kara wani.
The food was delicious.	Abincin yayi dadi.
It's all a game, from top to bottom.	Duk wasa ne, daga sama har kasa.
I don't want to see what's there now.	Ba zan so in ga abin da ke can yanzu ba.
I felt a little tired.	Na ji kadan kadan.
But for each answer, you have to remove something.	Amma ga kowace amsa, dole ne ku cire wani abu.
First, check the requirements.	Da farko, duba abubuwan da ake bukata.
We can't take it.	Ba za mu iya ɗauka ba.
Indeed, that is exactly what we do.	Lallai, wannan shine ainihin abin da muke yi.
It should be, but it is not.	Ya kamata ya zama, amma ba haka ba.
This place can be cold at night.	Wannan wurin yana iya yin sanyi da dare.
And it grew in size.	Kuma ya tashi cikin girma.
That's what we want.	Abin da muke so ke nan.
There is something well known about the man’s name.	Akwai wani abu da aka sani game da sunan mutumin.
She felt the same way.	Haka ita ma ta ji.
He brought himself.	Ya kawo kansa.
Today we are celebrating victory.	Yau za mu yi bikin nasara.
I want to lose	Ina so in rasa
Many have died since then.	Da yawa sun mutu tun lokacin.
She reached out to him.	Ta kai masa.
This method is used today.	Ana amfani da wannan hanyar a yau.
Are you from nearby?	Kuna daga nan kusa?
No one was seriously injured there because no one had any money.	Babu wanda ya sami rauni sosai a can saboda babu wanda ke da kuɗi.
Maybe you played right, and still failed.	Wataƙila kun yi wasa daidai, kuma har yanzu an yi rashin nasara.
We do not have to be here today.	Ba lallai ne mu kasance a nan ba yau.
I am still sick.	Har yanzu ina rashin lafiya.
It is the answer.	Amsa ce.
It doesn't look very good in the rain.	Ba ta kusa kyau sosai a cikin ruwan sama ba.
Sorry, but no.	Yi hakuri, amma a'a.
I do not feel that way.	Ba na jin haka ne.
He even looked off.	Ko da ya duba ya kashe.
Obviously, this will take some time.	Babu shakka, wannan zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci.
I will get a job.	Zan sami aiki.
I did not know you called.	Ban san ka kira ba.
The moon is full while he is here.	Wata ya cika lokacin da yake nan.
He is on a journey thinking about what he will do that day.	Yana cikin tafiya yana tunanin abin da zai yi a ranar.
The restaurant was amazing, but the food was so delicious.	Gidan abincin ya kasance abin ban mamaki, amma abincin ya yi dadi sosai.
They have the best of the best.	Suna da mafi kyawun mafi kyau.
Some still do.	Wasu har yanzu suna yi.
We all knew they would not answer me.	Mu duka mun san ba za su ba ni amsa ba.
That way you can do whatever you want to do.	Ta haka za ku iya yin duk abin da kuke so ku yi.
I will run with you.	Zan gudu da ku.
It's on me.	Yana yi akan nawa.
I want to know if anything has changed.	Ina so in sani ko wani abu ya canza.
This man was killed instantly.	An kashe wannan mutumin nan take.
But nothing came of it.	Amma ba abin da ya zo masa.
It is difficult not to focus on that.	Yana da wuya kada a mai da hankali kan hakan.
Maybe someone can.	Wataƙila wani zai iya.
In the morning we came and we went.	Da safe ta zo muka tafi.
If only she had gone.	Da ta tafi kawai.
Everything you say can and will be used.	Duk abin da kuka faɗa yana iya kuma za a yi amfani da ku.
Unlike everyone else there.	Ba kamar kowa a wurin ba.
I was told I did not speak.	Aka ce ban yi magana ba.
It should not be too long.	Bai kamata ya dade ba.
I did not cry, but.	Ban yi kuka ba, amma.
I wrote everyone that.	Na rubuta kowa da kowa cewa.
They say they do it three times a week.	Sun ce suna yin hakan sau uku a mako.
They were real.	Sun kasance da gaske.
Such people forget what they are, they stop.	Irin waɗannan mutane sun manta abin da suke, sun daina.
No one has money.	Babu wanda yake da kuɗi.
Try to find out what happened.	Gwada ku gano abin da ya faru.
He should not smoke.	Bai kamata ya sha taba ba.
And there is more to it.	Kuma akwai fiye da haka.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Amma da alama hakan ba haka yake ba.
Making this material takes a lot of effort and time.	Yin wannan kayan yana ɗaukar ƙoƙari da lokaci mai yawa.
They just wanted to meet.	Sun so su hadu ne kawai.
I would have done that.	Da zan yi haka.
Run from.	Gudu daga.
She did something to me that she would never know.	Ta yi min wani abu da ba za ta taɓa sani ba.
For two reasons, you know, what happened.	Saboda abubuwa biyu, kun san, abin da ya faru.
We left the car.	Muka bar motar.
Everything was horrible.	Duk abin ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
He kept walking.	Ya ci gaba da tafiya.
I like that too.	Ina son hakan kuma.
They always have something to say about everything.	Kullum suna da abin da za su ce game da komai.
No one spoke.	Ba wanda ya yi magana.
I want to be with him more.	Ina so in kara zama da shi.
The last one is ready to go.	Na karshen ya shirya ya tafi.
You do not have.	Ba ku da kai.
But the work continues.	Amma ana ci gaba da aikin.
He should be able to grow.	Kamata ya yi ya samu damar girma.
She is the one who is suffering, not him.	Ita ce ke shan wahala ba shi ba.
You do not have to get back on board.	Ba lallai ne ku dawo cikin jirgin ba.
We didn't really think about it.	Ba mu yi tunani sosai game da shi ba.
People will get tired of me.	Mutane za su gaji da ni.
I refused to be killed easily.	Na ƙi a kashe ni cikin sauƙi.
No one was scared or surprised.	Babu wanda ya ji tsoro ko ban mamaki.
I have a lot to do.	Ina da abin yi da yawa.
A good way.	Hanya mai kyau.
Hope this helped someone.	Da fatan wannan ya taimaka wa wani.
It is too hot to swim today.	Yana da zafi sosai don yin iyo a yau.
But we have one who does not agree.	Amma muna da wanda bai yarda ba.
I hope it is not hard to hear.	Ina fatan babu wuya ji.
Even now he can do that.	Ko a yanzu yana iya yin hakan.
He said I wanted to show him something.	Ya ce ina so in nuna mani wani abu.
I hope he gets it.	Ina fatan ya samu.
Only God can answer you.	Allah ne kadai ya iya amsa muku.
It fits here better than it does.	Ya dace a nan fiye da yadda ta yi.
Anything can happen, you know.	Komai na iya faruwa, kun sani.
But she did, somehow.	Amma ta yi, ko ta yaya.
But do not go.	Amma kar a tafi.
Anything that will make you comfortable.	Duk abin da zai sa ku dadi.
One cannot imagine what will happen next at this moment.	Ba za a iya tunanin abin da zai faru a gaba a wannan lokacin.
It's hard to go.	Da wuya a tafi.
I told you before.	Na gaya muku a baya.
Trust me, we will work with it.	Ku yarda da ni, za mu yi aiki da shi.
The house is very nice.	Gidan yayi kyau sosai.
Everyone loves them.	Kowa yana son su.
Amazing success.	Nasara mai ban mamaki.
It is not good if it is healthy.	Ba shi da kyau idan yana da lafiya.
They use us.	Suna amfani da mu.
No need to answer.	Babu bukatar amsa.
It's just not like the rest of you.	Kamar ba kamar sauran ku ba ne.
Fear was the right answer.	Da tsoro ya zama amsa daidai.
Not for long, he said.	Ba dan lokaci ba, ya ce.
Not good at all.	Ba kyau ko kadan.
This or nothing.	Wannan ko ba komai.
They are completely covered by people.	An rufe su gaba daya da mutane.
It adds a little sweetness.	Yana ƙara ɗan ƙara mai daɗi.
Before he died.	Kafin ya mutu.
We know that.	Mun san haka.
The water is cold.	Ruwan yayi sanyi.
But she has to.	Amma dole ta yi.
It's not that easy.	Ba shi da sauƙi haka.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
She seems to be able to do almost anything at the time.	Da alama zata iya yin komai a lokacin.
I have to get it.	Dole na samu.
It will be better for everyone.	Zai fi kyau ga kowa da kowa.
However, we will talk to others.	Duk da haka, za mu yi magana da wasu.
You can be honest.	Kuna iya yin gaskiya.
It's not really my thing.	Ba abu na bane da gaske.
He should go back to her.	Ya kamata ya koma mata.
I do not understand this.	Ban gane wannan ba.
I want to go out and do it.	Ina so in fita da yi.
I want to move fast.	Ina so in ci gaba da sauri.
There are two checks.	Ana samun duba biyu.
It will only be tonight.	Zai kasance na daren yau ne kawai.
She's not here for me.	Ba ta nan gare ni.
His head hit.	Kansa ya buga.
But so far nothing has happened.	Amma kawo yanzu babu abin da ya faru.
It has not been heard from for years.	Ba a ji shi tsawon shekaru.
No one heard me.	Babu wanda ya ji ni.
Age does not matter.	Shekaru ba komai.
The problem is, we are.	Matsalar ita ce, mu ne.
Help me! 	Taimake ni!
Of course I will return.	Tabbas zan koma.
You start the game, you play the game, someone wins.	Kun fara wasan, kun buga wasan, wani ya ci nasara.
To tell what happened, what happened.	Don ba da labarin abin da ya faru, abin da ya faru.
Save the amount of trouble.	Ajiye yawan matsala.
There, it was done.	A can, an yi.
He was the only one who did not get it.	Shi kadai ne bai samu ba.
There is still much more to do.	Har yanzu da sauran abubuwa da yawa a yi.
Not the first, you know.	Ba na farko ba, ka sani.
I just could not eat.	Kawai na kasa ci.
It is something much bigger.	Wani abu ne wanda ya fi haka girma.
Go ahead, show me.	Ci gaba, nuna mani.
This is very nice and easy.	Wannan yana da kyau sosai kuma yana da sauƙi.
The same thing happened to me.	Haka kuma abin ya faru da ni.
Gradually he became accustomed to speaking.	A hankali magana ya saba masa.
I looked at the food.	Na kalli abincin.
If you can do it from the beginning, please do so.	Idan za ku iya yin shi daga farko, don Allah ku yi haka.
You only get one world.	Kuna samun duniya ɗaya kawai.
Which should be right for me.	Wanda yakamata yayi min daidai.
We have to work together.	Dole ne mu yi aiki tare.
We can not let this happen.	Ba za mu iya barin wannan ya faru ba.
It was a lot, a lot.	Ya kasance mai yawa, da yawa.
More than once, even.	Fiye da sau ɗaya, ko da.
So they take a little longer than anything.	Don haka suna ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan fiye da komai.
They are beautiful.	Suna da kyau.
We look forward to working with you.	Za mu yi farin cikin yin aiki tare da ku.
Looking to the future maybe not.	Neman zuwa nan gaba watakila ba haka ba.
She can still do that.	Har yanzu tana iya yin hakan.
I had to write a new plan.	Dole ne in rubuta sabon shirin.
I got a lot of reading today in school.	Na samu karatu da yawa a yau a makaranta.
This is not mine!	Wannan ba nawa bane!
Or you can get something.	Ko kuna iya samun wani abu.
Nothing good.	Babu wani abu mai kyau.
The people laughed.	Mutane suka yi dariya.
It just isn’t true.	Kawai ba gaskiya ba ne.
But this is not true.	Amma wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
No success.	Babu nasara.
They all told me to come back.	Duk suka ce in dawo.
I got into it.	Na shiga cikin ta.
I don’t know if that will work, but it can.	Ban sani ba ko hakan zai yi aikin, amma yana iya.
We worked equally well with everyone.	Mun yi aiki daidai da kowa da kowa.
I see something in you.	Ina ganin wani abu a cikin ku.
I see how things have changed.	Na yadda abubuwa suka canza.
I wonder who can give us trouble.	Ina mamakin wanda zai iya ba mu matsala.
From now on.	Daga yanzu.
Your story can change the world.	Labarin ku na iya canza duniya.
There seems to be nothing to do.	Kamar babu wani abin yi.
But don't worry about that.	Amma kar ka damu da hakan.
I knew right away she had nothing.	Na san nan da nan ba ta da komai.
I am intelligent.	Ni mai hankali ne.
I can't eat much.	Ba zan iya cin abinci da yawa ba.
That may not be true.	Wannan ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
She asked.	Ta tambaye shi.
I think we should cover one by one.	Ina ganin ya kamata mu rufe daya da daya.
She does not even know what to do when she arrives.	Ba ta ma san me za ta yi idan ta isa wurin.
He will protect me.	Shi ne zai kare ni.
This is it !.	Wannan shi ne!.
You all know it is wrong but it feels really good.	Kun san duk ba daidai ba ne amma yana jin daɗi sosai.
People do not talk and do that.	Mutane ba sa magana da yin haka.
And let me tell you one thing.	Kuma bari in sake gaya muku wani abu guda.
I want this to be taken care of early.	Ina son a kula da wannan da wuri.
Still working it was good for me.	Duk da haka yana aiki yana da kyau a gare ni.
So, I need a chance from you.	Don haka, ina buƙatar dama daga gare ku.
There is! 	Akwai!
It is not an easy task.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
He is familiar with everything.	Ya saba da komai.
And she did very well.	Kuma ta yi sosai.
Not so now.	Ba haka bane yanzu.
Overall visible.	Wanda ake iya gani gaba ɗaya.
Look out.	Yi hankali.
They always get the job.	Kullum suna samun aikin.
This has not yet been fixed.	Har yanzu ba a gyara wannan ba.
Some are very good.	Wasu suna da kyau sosai.
She had to take care of the house.	Dole ta kula da gidan.
He wanted to get up and run.	Ya so ya tashi da gudu.
For some, it takes more than that.	Ga wasu, yana ɗaukar fiye da haka.
It would be good to know how to do it.	Zai yi kyau a san yadda ake yin shi.
It feels like.	Yana jin kamar.
Read it carefully.	Karanta shi a hankali.
He called it.	Ya kira shi.
Nothing has really changed.	Babu wani abu da ya canza da gaske.
Everyone knows each other.	Kowa ya san juna.
Quickly it got out of hand.	Da sauri abin ya fita daga hannu.
Many died.	Mutane da yawa sun mutu.
Now, let's go to sleep.	Yanzu, bari mu ɗan yi barci.
You have nothing to lose.	Ba ku da abin da za ku rasa.
He read an amazing book.	Yayi karatu mai ban mamaki.
This is the way.	Wannan ita ce hanya.
I see she is not.	Na ga ba ita ba ce.
He said, these are good.	Ya ce, waɗannan suna da kyau.
They know what they want and how to get it.	Sun san abin da suke so da yadda za su samu.
It is an endeavor not an end.	Ƙoƙari ne ba ƙarshe ba.
Until next time it happened.	Har zuwa lokaci na gaba abin ya faru.
And it worked really well and some were not very good.	Kuma ya yi aiki sosai kuma wasu ba su da kyau sosai.
It really is.	Yana da gaske.
He died for me.	Ya mutu a kaina.
You are going to school.	Za ku je makaranta.
I want you to look at this.	Ina so ku kalli wannan.
Please check back when you have the opportunity.	Da fatan za a duba lokacin da kuka sami dama.
This book is my favorite so far.	Wannan littafin shine wanda na fi so ya zuwa yanzu.
I'll let you go.	Zan bar ku ku tafi.
I don't live now.	Bana zaune yanzu.
It was a difficult day.	Ta kasance rana mai wahala.
But they said no.	Amma suka ce a'a.
Just give it time.	Kawai a ba shi lokaci.
I would never have had the opportunity to do this right.	Ba zan taɓa samun damar yin wannan daidai ba.
I love this time of year.	Ina son wannan lokacin na shekara.
Remember, there is more to life than money.	Ka tuna, akwai abubuwa da yawa a rayuwa fiye da kuɗi.
When he reaches it.	Idan ya isa gare ta.
I didn't know you would see that.	Ban san za ku ga haka ba.
Looking for happiness.	Neman farin ciki.
I'm glad to see you again.	Na yi farin cikin ganin ku kuma.
I love the man.	Ina son mutumin.
Just help me.	Ka taimake ni kawai.
We are on the same page again.	Muna kan wannan lokacin kuma.
He called me and we went out to eat.	Ya kira ni, muka fita cin abinci.
She doesn't know when.	Ba ta san ko yaushe ne.
He knows how to tell the story you want to hear.	Ya san yadda ake ba da labarin da kuke son ji.
Everyone around him changed.	Duk wanda ke kusa da shi ya canza.
You can work on yourself of course.	Kuna iya yin aiki da kanku ba shakka.
She wrote to us.	Ta rubuta mana.
Still, she didn’t get it.	Har yanzu, ba ta samu ba.
We go on living.	Muna ci gaba da rayuwa.
Please check.	Da fatan za a duba.
Maybe he has nowhere to go.	Wataƙila ba shi da wani wurin da zai je.
Now that was new because she didn’t get up from work.	Yanzu abin ya kasance sabon abu saboda ba ta tashi daga aiki.
You have no games yet.	Ba ku da wani wasa tukuna.
You're done early.	Kun yi da wuri.
You would be right there without me.	Za ku kasance daidai a can ba tare da ni ba.
I hope not.	Ina fatan ba haka ba.
They have grown for many years.	Sun yi girma shekaru da yawa.
She is interested in what she wants.	Tana da sha'awar abin da take so.
I hope that happens soon.	Ina fata hakan zai faru da wuri.
We have food, water.	Muna da abinci, ruwa.
Or we too will go.	Ko kuma mu ma za a tafi.
I started crying.	Na fara kuka.
I passed the travel plan.	Na wuce shirin tafiya.
Even more than usual.	Har ma fiye da yadda aka saba.
And, you know, it's true.	Kuma, ka sani, yana da gaskiya.
One more month.	Wata daya babu kuma.
That would be true.	Da ma hakan gaskiya ne.
This is the first time it has ever happened.	Wannan shi ne karo na farko da ya taba faruwa.
These can be scary.	Waɗannan na iya zama abin ban tsoro.
I'm very sorry.	Zan yi hakuri.
It will not work.	Ba zai yi amfani ba.
You can not reach him except by boat.	Ba za ku iya isa gare shi ba sai ta jirgin ruwa.
She was the first to sign.	Ita ce ta fara sa hannu.
They are not who you are.	Ba su wanene kuma menene ku ba.
He was great.	Ya kasance mai girma.
It was on me at the time.	Ya kasance a kaina a lokacin.
You have not finished your homework yet.	Ba ku gama aikin gida ba tukuna.
People are still talking about it.	Har yanzu mutane suna magana game da shi.
It's your money.	Kuɗin ku ne.
So let's stay inside.	Don haka mu tsaya a ciki.
But now, at that moment.	Amma a yanzu, a wannan lokacin.
People will not stand for him.	Mutane ba za su tsaya gare shi ba.
You made me feel like a man of the year.	Kun sanya ni jin kamar mutumin shekara.
We did it like this.	Mun yi haka kamar haka.
See you in game !.	Sai mun hadu a wasa!.
He came home.	Ya zo gida.
This suits them.	Wannan ya dace da su.
Everyone did the same.	Haka kowa yayi.
I almost stopped it.	Na kusa daina shi.
Take care of your health.	Kula da lafiya.
The whole house is empty.	Duk gidan babu kowa.
He is ill.	Ya bata lafiya.
She took care of everything.	Ta kula da komai.
I went, like, three times now.	Na tafi, kamar, sau uku yanzu.
Make sure he is not sick.	Tabbatar ba shi da lafiya.
I will put something on you.	Zan sa wani abu a kan ku.
So it has to be true.	Don haka dole ne ya zama gaskiya.
It's good to hear.	Yana da kyau a ji.
However, we got used to them after a while.	Duk da haka, mun saba da su bayan wani lokaci.
But then night fell.	Amma sai dare ya yi.
Sign in, please.	Shiga ciki, don Allah.
Did you sleep well?	Shin kun yi barci lafiya?
He asked me.	Ya tambaye ni.
He loves you completely.	Yana son ku gaba daya.
The food is very good.	Abincin yayi kyau sosai.
It's work.	Aiki ne.
This started working today.	Wannan ya fara aiki a yau.
It's a pity.	Abin bakin ciki ne.
The night is long.	Dare ya dade.
But that is not easy to do.	Amma hakan ba shi da sauƙi a yi.
He would never let anyone touch them.	Ba zai taɓa barin kowa ya taɓa su ba.
I don't want anything to do with them.	Ba na son komai da su.
I turned it on and off several times now.	Na kunna kuma na kashe sau da yawa yanzu.
He said he was on his way.	Ya ce yana nan a hanya.
But it is still too late to work.	Amma har yanzu bai makara ba don yin aiki.
You should not go out at this time of night.	Bai kamata ku fita a wannan lokaci na dare ba.
So are the children.	Haka yara suke.
They keep coming.	Suka ci gaba da zuwa.
What happened?	Me ya faru?
But now it may be too late.	Amma yanzu watakila ya makara.
Now I know what.	Yanzu na san menene.
I find a way to succeed no matter what.	Ina samun hanyar yin nasara ko da menene.
Twice a week.	Sau biyu a mako.
No one walks.	Babu mai tafiya.
They won.	Sun ci nasara.
What she got into.	Abin da ta shiga.
Why do you want to do this?	Me yasa kuke son yin wannan?
Or any of the others since.	Ko wani daga cikin sauran tun.
This is nothing.	Wannan ba komai bane.
They take good care of you.	Suna kula da ku sosai.
Whatever makes you think so.	Duk abin da ya sa ka yi tunanin haka.
Real thing.	Abu na gaske.
They will tell you what cannot be done, and why.	Za su gaya muku abin da ba za a iya yi ba, kuma me ya sa.
He did what he wanted anyway.	Ya yi abin da yake so ko yaya.
We are human beings.	Mu mutum ne kasa.
It's weird, though.	Abin mamaki ne, ko da yake.
It would just be better.	Zai fi kyau kawai.
I stayed with him for a while.	Na zauna tare da shi na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Neither did you.	Kai ma ba ka yi ba.
After that, they had to call the police.	Bayan haka, dole ne su kira 'yan sanda.
There is good money to be made there.	Akwai kuɗi masu kyau da za a yi a wurin.
I wanted them to know.	Na so su sani.
First you will see healthy and happy children.	Da farko za ku ga yara masu lafiya da farin ciki.
Children should not act like that.	Bai kamata yara su yi aiki haka ba.
It doesn't look very good.	Ba ya ganin kyau sosai.
We will come back to this later.	Za mu dawo kan wannan a gaba.
You can’t imagine how good they were.	Ba za ka iya tunanin yadda suka yi kyau ba.
In the end, no one was hurt.	A ƙarshe, babu wanda ya ji rauni.
He worked, he worked, and he worked with others.	Ya yi aiki, ya yi aiki, kuma ya yi aiki da wasu.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
You have no help.	Ba ku da taimako.
He did not succeed.	Bai yi nasara ba.
You feel like you are twelve.	Kuna ji kamar kuna sha biyu.
We are the only ones who have them now.	Mu ne kawai muke da su a yanzu.
And I have a job.	Kuma ina da aiki.
I will try and explain that.	Zan gwada kuma in bayyana hakan.
I am not myself.	Ba ni da kansa.
Just without me.	Kawai ba tare da ni ba.
The children slept inside.	Yara sun kwana ta ciki.
Then there is fear.	Sai kuma tsoro.
And they were, really.	Kuma sun kasance, da gaske.
Some think he committed suicide.	Wasu na ganin ya kashe kansa.
She tried to refuse but could not help.	Ta yi ƙoƙari ta ƙi amma ta kasa taimaka.
I sat down and said.	Na zauna na ce.
I know this.	Na san wannan.
I want to tell you this.	Ina so in gaya muku wannan.
Obviously, it didn’t work.	Babu shakka, bai yi aiki ba.
Surprisingly.	Abin mamaki .
You know that.	Kun san haka.
Many people were taken at the time.	An dauki mutane da yawa a lokacin.
We could not speak.	Mun kasa magana.
He did not stop there.	Bai tsaya a haka ba.
He opened the whole house.	Ya bude gidan gaba daya.
We told them not to come back.	Muka ce kar su dawo.
She can't.	Ba za ta iya ba.
I have never felt so comfortable.	Ban taba jin dadi haka ba.
Many died.	Mutane da yawa sun mutu.
It's easy.	Yana da sauƙi.
And they will kill him.	Kuma za su kashe shi.
Talk about what you want to do.	Yi magana game da abin da kuke so ku yi.
You may not know.	Ba za ku iya sani ba.
Make your name known.	Sanya sunan ku duka.
He hoped it would rain.	Ya yi fatan za a yi ruwan sama.
The house lived in it.	Gidan ya zauna a ciki.
You know how good they all are, there.	Kun san yadda suke da kyau duka, a can.
We will check.	Za mu duba.
That he does not want to understand.	Cewa baya so ya gane.
This, for me, is a problem.	Wannan, a gare ni, matsala ce.
I need to sleep, but I can't.	Ina bukata in yi barci, amma ba zan iya ba.
I really enjoyed it.	Na ji daɗi sosai.
I have nothing to lose.	Ba ni da abin da zan rasa.
Don't wait to be asked.	Kar a jira a tambaye ku.
The game can only reach you.	Wasan zai iya kai ku kawai.
You really care about success.	Kuna damu sosai game da cin nasara.
They offer what to buy.	Suna ba da abin da za mu saya.
The same is true in the world.	Haka abin yake a duniya.
I was wrong.	Na yi kuskure.
How it all came back to me.	Yadda duk ya dawo gare ni.
They are still right though.	Har yanzu suna daidai ko da yake.
Maybe he just went home.	Wataƙila ya tafi gida kawai.
Everyone sat on everyone.	Kowa ya zauna akan kowa.
Did you say anything yet?	Kun ce wani abu tukuna?
You know, we can do it.	Ka sani, za mu iya yi.
So it has become a very widely used tool.	Don haka ya zama kayan aiki da ake amfani da shi sosai.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Gara ya fi kyau.
I really want him to be here.	Ina matukar son ya kasance a nan.
To do something.	Don yin wani abu.
The other is the same.	Sauran daya ne.
This is metal.	Wannan karfe ne.
But no one cared.	Amma babu wanda ya damu.
It’s useful, and it’s interesting.	Yana da amfani, kuma yana da sha'awar.
I told him where we were eating.	Na gaya masa inda muke ci.
They have lived here for many years.	Sun zauna a nan shekaru da yawa.
You should go now.	Ya kamata ku tafi yanzu.
You killed a man.	Ka kashe mutum.
Weep slowly.	Kuka take a hankali.
She would not start talking to me.	Ita kuma ba zata fara yi mani magana ba.
Now we need to do two things.	Yanzu muna bukatar mu yi abubuwa biyu.
Continue as you say before.	Ci gaba kamar yadda kuke faɗa a baya.
Coming in and out is not difficult.	Shiga da fita ba shi da wahala.
It's a big hobby.	Babban sha'awa ne.
I would have killed myself.	Da na kashe kaina.
I was out when everything was gone.	Ina waje lokacin da komai ya tafi.
I feel very comfortable here.	Ina jin dadi sosai a nan.
See good.	Ganin kyau.
No one enters or leaves.	Babu wanda yake shiga ko fita.
When we grow up, we will have a wonderful life.	Lokacin da muka girma, za mu yi rayuwa mafi ban sha'awa.
Again, this is not true.	Har yanzu, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
You never touched yourself.	Ba ka taba kan ka ba.
Everyone heard it.	Kowa ya ji shi.
Whatever happens.	Duk abin da zai faru.
Please do not bring children to you.	Don Allah kar a kawo yara zuwa wurin ku.
No right here.	Babu dama a nan.
He thought he knew that now.	Ya dauka ya san haka yanzu.
It makes things grow.	Yana sa abubuwa su girma.
In trouble, of course.	A cikin matsala, babu shakka.
I have nothing against it now.	Ba ni da komai a kai yanzu.
She is still waiting.	Har yanzu tana jira.
The station is empty.	Tashar babu kowa.
Not the way you want them to be.	Ba yadda kuke so su kasance ba.
Not to get bigger.	Ba don samun girma ba.
He appeared at the door.	Ya bayyana a bakin kofar.
He had to find out.	Dole ne ya gano.
That's why you don't want to leave me behind.	Shi ya sa ba ka so ka bar ni can baya.
He did not speak for a long time.	Ya dade bai yi magana ba.
One knows them immediately.	Mutum ya san su nan da nan.
I know of course there is another issue.	Na san tabbas akwai wata magana kuma.
I only got this job for a while today.	Na sami wannan aikin na ɗan lokaci ne kawai a yau.
Tomorrow will be better than today, of course.	Gobe ​​zai fi yau, tabbas.
The dress fits snugly.	Rigar ta dace da kyau.
I have no money right now.	Ba ni da kuɗi a yanzu.
Maybe that shouldn’t come as a surprise.	Wataƙila wannan bai kamata ya zo da mamaki ba.
She has it now, she knows it.	Tana da shi yanzu, ta san shi.
That made me think.	Wannan ya sa na yi tunani.
She did not want to hear more.	Ba ta son ƙara ji.
Travel home safely.	A yi tafiya gida lafiya.
Maybe there is still someone in it.	Wataƙila har yanzu akwai wani a ciki.
They have what we do not have.	Suna da abin da ba mu da shi.
Don't worry about me.	Kada ku damu da ni.
You do not want to hurt someone.	Ba ka so ka bata wa daya rai.
Not you.	Ba kai ne ba.
It just takes you.	Yana ɗaukar ku kawai.
You see a lot.	Kuna gani da yawa.
Break whatever they need.	Karya duk wani abu da suke bukata.
No, he does not want to get involved again.	A'a, baya neman sake shiga hannu.
He just found the place.	Ya sami wurin kawai.
This is the room where you prepare food.	Wannan shine dakin da kuke shirya abinci.
But, today was a happy day.	Amma, yau ya kasance mai daɗi.
And it is the right thing to do.	Kuma abu ne da ya dace a yi.
Nothing like it.	Ba abin da ya yi kama da shi.
Absolutely not.	Babu shakka ko wanene.
They travel fast.	Tafiya suke cikin sauri.
But there is no fear.	Amma ba za a ji tsoro ba.
You are here now.	Kuna nan yanzu.
But that did not happen.	Amma hakan bai faru ba.
Believe me, it is.	Ku yarda da ni, shi ne.
It seems to have worked so far.	Da alama ya yi aiki ya zuwa yanzu.
Just know where to start.	Kawai ku san inda zan fara.
At first she was afraid to go out alone.	Da farko tana tsoron fita ita kadai.
We did, we tried.	Mun yi, mun gwada.
I want to work with you on this.	Ina so in yi aiki tare da ku akan wannan.
And that cannot happen.	Kuma hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
No, just no.	A'a, a'a kawai.
Great game for us.	Babban wasa gare mu.
A drink of water.	Abin sha na ruwa.
He met a woman and had sex with her.	Ya hadu da wata mata, ya fara kwana da ita.
But read the book.	Amma karanta littafin.
He knew where he was going, but nothing happened.	Ya san inda zai kai, amma ba komai.
I hope so.	Ina fatan haka ne.
Maybe a day or two.	Wataƙila kwana ɗaya ko biyu.
Probably the best thing they did.	Wataƙila mafi kyawun abin da suka yi.
God can do that.	Allah zai iya yin haka.
I do not even know that the thought is not true.	Ban ma san cewa tunani ba gaskiya ba ne.
They will not touch it.	Ba za su taba shi ba.
Not to study.	Ba don yin karatu ba.
But there is something here that he can not leave yet.	Amma akwai wani abu a nan da ba zai iya barin ba tukuna.
She seemed to feel comfortable sitting next to me.	Ta yi kamar tana jin daɗin zama kusa da ni.
We will continue.	Za mu ci gaba.
You must go.	Dole ne ku tafi.
It can make it difficult.	Zai iya sa shi da wuya.
Then one night everything changed.	Sai dare daya komai ya canza.
Not recommended.	Ba a ba da shawarar ba.
I like yes.	Ina kamar a.
You are in them, they take time.	Kuna cikin su, suna ɗaukar lokaci.
I would have given you everything.	Da na baka komai.
I felt comfortable there.	Na ji dadi a can.
I remember doing that a lot at the time.	Na tuna yin hakan da yawa a lokacin.
They cried for years.	Sun yi kuka da shekaru.
That is a good thing.	Abin farin ciki ne hakan.
That's why we were there in the beginning.	Shi ya sa muke can tun farko.
I have to go back there, he told himself.	Dole ne in koma can, ya gaya wa kansa.
Let me find out what you think.	Bari in sami abin da kuke tunani.
By people like them.	Ta mutane irin su.
I do not agree with that.	Ban yarda da hakan ba.
Therefore, it is very difficult to do a good job.	Saboda haka, yana da matukar wahala a yi aiki mai kyau.
I think maybe it is inside.	Ina tsammanin watakila yana ciki.
I think you probably don't care.	Na yi tunanin watakila ba ku damu ba.
No doubt he had seen such a thing before.	Babu shakka ya taba ganin irin wannan abu a baya.
What brought you here?	Me ya kawo ku?
If he did, it did not show.	Idan ya yi, bai nuna ba.
We cannot do this without your help.	Ba za mu iya yin hakan ba tare da taimakon ku ba.
But no one agreed to talk about it.	Amma babu wanda ya yarda ya yi magana game da shi.
And you make me hear again.	Kuma kana sa ni sake ji.
This is not easy to find.	Wannan ba shi da sauƙi a samu.
After all, you can't do that.	Bayan haka, ba za ku iya yin hakan ba.
It should be better this year.	Ya kamata ya fi kyau a wannan shekara.
If not, most people will.	Idan ba haka ba, mutane da yawa za su yi.
I agree.	Na yarda haka.
He would think of something.	Zai yi tunanin wani abu.
It hasn't been long since we've been together.	Ba a dade da zama daya ba.
To work.	Don yin aiki.
They take time to grow on people.	Suna ɗaukar lokaci don girma akan mutane.
She started walking.	Ta fara tafiya.
I can't find one.	Ba zan iya samun daya ba.
This is a very sad day.	Wannan rana ce mai matukar bakin ciki.
But they knew they had to go.	Amma sun san dole su yi tafiya.
Everything is working fine.	Komai yana aiki lafiya.
Or, you can drink for up to a year.	Ko, za ku iya sha har tsawon shekara guda.
But this is not necessarily a bad thing.	Amma wannan ba lallai ba ne mummunan abu.
Maybe he won’t play at the time.	Wataƙila ba zai yi wasa ba a lokacin.
That's what he wants.	Abin da yake so kenan.
Some do.	Wasu ma suna yi.
They are.	Haka suke.
Then it rained a lot.	Sai ruwan sama mai yawa.
Sitting there in the water.	Zaune a can cikin ruwa.
I remember that.	Na tuna da haka.
They know where we are.	Sun san inda muke.
I think it was an amazing job.	Ina tsammanin aiki ne mai ban mamaki.
No one is considered useful.	Babu wani da aka ɗauka yana da amfani.
Nice to meet you guys.	Na yi farin cikin samun ku mutane.
That hurts a lot.	Hakan yayi zafi sosai.
We want to get people to do what we want them to do.	Muna so mu sa mutane su yi abin da muke so.
He is completely familiar with me.	Ya saba da ni gaba daya.
He thought that would be the case.	Ya yi tunanin hakan zai kasance.
Hope you are honest.	Da fatan kun kasance masu gaskiya.
And you did well.	Kuma kun yi kyau.
They just want to go to work.	Suna son zuwa aiki kawai.
This method will be very effective.	Wannan hanyar za ta kasance cikin aiki sosai.
There is no proper plan.	Babu shirin da ya dace.
Volunteers did a great job.	Masu aikin sa kai sun yi babban aiki.
It works on everything.	Yana aiki akan komai.
Or something later.	Ko wani abu daga baya.
We need more.	Muna buƙatar ƙarin.
This made her different, unlike the others.	Hakan ya sa ta saba, ba kamar sauran ba.
He reached out to the kids and they loved it.	Ya kai wa yara kuma suna son shi.
Today, everyone does everything.	A yau, kowa yana yin komai.
It is not.	Ba ita ba ce.
But that does not have to be this way.	Amma wannan baya bukatar zama haka.
There’s something weird about it, though.	Akwai wani abin ban mamaki game da shi, ko da yake.
Tomorrow will not be very good.	Gobe ​​ba zai yi kyau sosai ba.
They knew we weren’t going into an easy time.	Sun san ba mu shiga cikin lokaci mai sauƙi ba.
I know it's really good.	Na san yana da kyau sosai.
I asked him.	Na tambaye shi.
I am not close.	Ba a kusa da ni ba.
We have no doubts.	Ba mu yi shakka ba.
He must now see more and more to see the truth.	Dole ne yanzu ya ƙara gani kuma ya ƙara ganin gaskiya.
Others reject us.	Wasu kuma sun ƙi yarda da mu.
They bring something new to women.	Wani sabon abu suke kawo mata.
Other users here do not have this problem.	Sauran masu amfani a nan ba su da wannan matsalar.
I think you will find it amazing.	Ina tsammanin za ku ga yana da ban mamaki.
I try to enjoy everything that happens to me.	Ina ƙoƙarin jin daɗin duk abin da ya faru da ni.
We were surprised.	Mun yi mamaki.
Let them do it one day.	Bari su yi shi a wata rana.
Make sure you get these things you want before they go away.	Tabbatar samun waɗannan abubuwan da kuke so kafin su tafi.
I have never seen anything like them.	Ban taba ganin wani abu kamar su ba.
She never came here.	Ba ta taba zuwa nan ba.
I don't think so.	Ba na tunani.
I don't think so.	Ba ni take tunani ba.
To learn more about.	Don ƙarin sani game da.
She loves him every night, no matter what.	Ta so shi kowane dare, komai.
You can sleep.	Kuna iya yin barci.
They did it again.	Suka sake yi mata.
He grew up like me.	Ya girma kamar kaina.
So it was.	Don haka ya kasance.
Nice to work with you.	An yi farin ciki yin aiki tare da ku.
He did not hear any noise.	Bai ji wani kara ba.
It is not so.	Ba haka yake ba.
No one has ever been there.	Babu wanda ya taɓa zuwa wurin.
But now we are.	Amma yanzu muna.
I'll finish my drink.	Zan gama sha na.
They will never get through.	Ba za su taba kai ta wurin ba.
They do not want to.	Ba sa so.
This event has become a favorite of everyone.	Wannan taron ya zama babban abin so ga kowa.
Just show that you are interested if you are.	Kawai nuna cewa kuna sha'awar idan kuna.
You thought you were on this one.	Kun yi tsammanin kuna kan wannan.
I have to finish my homework.	Dole ne in gama aikin gida na.
In a way she was good.	A hanyar da ta kasance mai kyau.
Focus on that now.	Mai da hankali kan hakan a yanzu.
So, tell me.	Don haka, gaya mani.
People like it.	Mutane sun so shi.
He should know.	Kamata yayi ya sani.
He forgot for a moment where he was.	Ya manta da dan lokaci inda yake.
But he is scared.	Amma yana tsoro.
You can have anything.	Kuna iya samun komai.
Few have ever forgotten what happened.	Kadan suka taɓa manta da abin da ya faru.
Need to go.	Bukatar tafi.
This is a big mistake.	Wannan babban kuskure ne.
But that is my future.	Amma hakan ya kasance a nan gaba na.
Maybe I was completely wrong here.	Wataƙila na yi kuskure gaba ɗaya a nan.
Too much water is not good for the skin.	Ruwa da yawa bai yi kyau ga fata ba.
He did it.	Ya yi shi.
The water was plentiful.	Ruwa ya kasance mai yawa.
I don’t want to be surprised.	Ba na son yin mamaki.
It doesn't matter where you are.	Ba komai a ina.
He was where he was supposed to be.	Ya kasance inda ya kamata ya kasance.
I had to worry about all these opportunities.	Dole ne in damu da duk waɗannan damar.
It fits really well and is in it.	Ya dace sosai kuma yana cikin haka.
This car is saying play.	Wannan motar tana cewa wasa.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Stick with the plan.	Tsaya tare da shirin.
And she said she would.	Sai ta ce za ta yi.
I'm smart	Ina da hankali
He really did.	Ya yi da gaske.
It is better to forget both.	Zai fi kyau a manta da duka.
It is wrong to do.	Ba daidai ba ne a yi.
Think about it.	Ka yi tunanin shi.
Her dress was cold.	Rigar ta ta yi sanyi.
It makes me really happy.	Yana sa ni farin ciki na gaske.
I need to tell her.	Ina bukata in gaya mata.
The whole world is watching you.	Duk duniya tana kallon ku.
I wasted a lot of time.	Na bata lokaci mai yawa.
They have done this before.	Sun sha yin haka a baya.
There is no way out.	Babu wata hanyar fita daga ciki.
Quickly again.	Da sauri kuma.
But before we can do anything, we must have something to eat.	Amma kafin mu yi wani abu, dole ne mu sami abin da za mu ci.
Twice they tried very hard.	Sau biyu sun yi ƙoƙari sosai.
No one will speak.	Babu wanda zai yi magana.
Just make sure to bring it back.	Kawai tabbatar da dawo da shi.
He loves to travel.	Yana son tafiya.
Admittedly, this was not difficult.	A gaskiya, hakan bai yi wuya ba.
The same can be true of women.	Haka zai iya zama mata.
John can’t go wrong here.	John ba zai iya yin kuskure a nan ba.
But wait for it.	Amma jira shi.
It should not look like this.	Bai kamata yayi kama da wannan ba.
She knew about it.	Ta san game da shi.
That's right.	Shi haka yake.
This is the last thing you want.	Wannan shine abu na ƙarshe da kuke so.
I do not mind.	Ban damu ba.
They’re good, though.	Suna da kyau, ko da yake.
We love her.	Muna son ta.
I think we should leave here.	Ina ganin gara mu bar nan.
He heard her start to cry.	Ya ji ta fara kuka.
I write them.	Ina rubuta su.
I do not want to bring this school.	Bana so in kawo wannan makaranta.
I think he will sign.	Ina tsammanin zai sanya hannu.
And there is only one way.	Kuma akwai kawai hanya daya.
But he himself was beyond fear.	Amma shi kansa ya wuce tsoro.
I could not explain it.	Na kasa bayyana shi.
Maybe this is not mine.	Wataƙila wannan ba nawa ba ne.
That can’t be a bad thing.	Wannan ba zai iya zama mummunan abu ba.
I really enjoyed this movie.	Ina jin daɗin wannan fim ɗin.
It was on him however.	Ya kasance akan shi duk da haka.
The sun has not yet risen.	Har yanzu rana bata fito ba.
So, really, please.	Don haka, da gaske, don Allah.
There is no doubt about that.	Babu shakka game da wannan.
And it is just.	Kuma shi ne kawai.
I am still in school.	Har yanzu ina makaranta.
He immediately heard the news.	Nan da nan ya ji labarin.
The car is gone.	Mota ta tafi.
What she was here for so.	Me ta kasance a nan don haka.
And no calls received.	Kuma ba a samun kira.
But she failed.	Amma ta kasa yi.
No one wants to hear that.	Ba wanda ke son jin haka.
But it is not enough, it is not close enough.	Amma bai isa ba, bai kusa isa ba.
Do not go where they tell you to go.	Kar ka je inda suka ce maka.
They are late.	Sun makara.
Kids will be amazed.	Yara za su yi mamaki.
I want to be alone.	Ina son zama ni kadai.
Turn it off.	Kashe shi.
He ate alone.	Ya ci shi kadai.
I like to do almost anything fun.	Ina son yin kusan kowane abu mai daɗi.
That's when it happened.	A lokacin ne abin ya faru.
I'm scared.	Ina tsoro.
The food went well.	Abincin ya tafi sosai.
The room is not hot.	Dakin baya zafi.
But he knew he couldn't.	Amma ya san ba zai iya ba.
We want to prove the truth.	Muna so mu tabbatar da gaskiya.
She did it too sometimes.	Ita ma ta yi wani lokaci.
The restaurant offers very good food.	Gidan cin abinci yana ba da abinci mai kyau sosai.
Say the goods are well covered.	Ka ce kayan an rufe su da kyau.
I really enjoyed it.	Na ji daɗi sosai.
You do not need.	Ba ku buƙatar .
She agrees.	Ta yarda haka ne.
We are safe.	Muna lafiya.
I don't even remember what really happened.	Ban ma tuna ainihin abin da ya faru ba.
You have not lost anything.	Ba ku rasa komai ba.
It’s not about what she was a big dog for.	Ba game da abin da ta kasance babban kare ba.
Something has to change for everyone to succeed.	Dole ne wani abu ya canza don kowa ya yi nasara.
This is a wonderful place.	Wannan wuri ne mai ban mamaki.
It starts tomorrow.	Ana fara gobe.
The sun has not yet risen.	Har yanzu rana bata tashi ba.
I'm sure someone can find them.	Na tabbata wani zai iya samun su.
I'm trying to help.	Ina ƙoƙarin taimaka.
I can never hear that again, man.	Ba zan iya sake jin haka ba, mutum.
I don't want the night to catch up with me.	Ba na son dare ya kama ni.
She was in it.	Ta kasance a ciki.
I think it hurts.	Ina tsammanin ya yi rauni.
He is like you.	Shi kamar ku ne.
No money required.	Babu kudi da ake bukata.
The way to get what you want.	Hanyar samun abin da kuke so.
He was very successful.	Ya yi nasara sosai.
I can't eat.	Ba zan iya ci ba.
I checked this out for help.	Na duba wannan don taimako.
On the day she was released.	A ranar aka sake ta.
I have no reason to worry.	Ban sami dalilin da zai damu ba.
Arrive on time to work.	Zuwa kan lokaci don aiki.
I was just laughing.	Dariya kawai nake yi.
I will not sell it to you.	Ni ma ba zan sayar muku da shi ba.
Not very interesting.	Ba sha'awa sosai.
The process is easy and you. 	Hanyar yana da sauƙi kuma ku. 
There will never be more.	Ba za a taɓa samun ƙarin ba.

Three died instantly.	Uku sun mutu nan take.
For me that is mine.	A gare ni abin da yake nawa ne.
You go to school and do something for yourself.	Za ku je makaranta ku yi wani abu na kanku.
However, it is not the first.	Duk da haka, ba shi ne na farko ba.
I stopped taking it a year ago.	Na daina shan shi shekara guda da ta wuce.
I do not want anyone to see this.	Ba na son kowa ya ga wannan.
I'm doing well.	Ina yi da kyau.
Join me.	Shiga tare da ni.
The one who is not inside.	Wanda baya ciki.
Try again and again.	Gwada kuma kasa.
The food is good.	Abinci ya yi kyau.
One for every day they were together.	Daya ga kowace rana sun kasance tare.
You will fit perfectly.	Za ku dace daidai.
Many may and may not make mistakes.	Da yawa na iya kuma za su yi kuskure.
I can't take it seriously.	Ba zan iya ɗauka da gaske ba.
What a waste of time this was.	Wane irin bata lokaci ne wannan ya kasance.
You can't get up inside.	Ba za ku iya tashi a ciki ba.
He is unhappy.	Ba shi da jin daɗi.
And they paid for it.	Kuma sun biya shi.
And another.	Kuma wani.
His look did not.	Kallon sa bai yi ba.
I know this is not what you want to hear.	Na san wannan ba shine abin da kuke son ji ba.
Today is better.	Yau ya fi kyau.
I know him and you know him.	Na san shi kuma kun san shi.
It makes it seem like nothing has ever happened here.	Yana sa ya zama kamar babu abin da ya taɓa faruwa a nan.
Nothing yet, but it's still early.	Ba komai tukuna, amma har yanzu yana da wuri.
Be right back.	Ina zuwa.
Things are going well.	Abubuwa suna tafiya lafiya.
I have to come back.	Dole ne in dawo.
Hope you like them !.	Da fatan kuna son su!.
It's like a country.	Kamar wata kasa ce.
You are what you eat.	Kai ne abin da kuke ci.
Certainly not.	Lallai ba zai iya ba.
That's good.	Haka yayi kyau.
Whoever it is.	Wanda ya kasance.
Let's get up tomorrow.	Mu tashi gobe.
Just wanted to say go ahead !.	Kawai so ya ce ku ci gaba!.
But, well.	Amma, da kyau.
That could really change the game.	Wannan na iya canza wasan da gaske.
I don’t care what they did before that.	Ban damu da abin da suka yi kafin wannan.
Now, here it is.	Yanzu, ga shi kuma.
Closely! 	A hankali!
Two children in two homes.	Yara biyu a gida biyu.
This is where we stayed.	A nan ne muka zauna.
What amazes me is how.	Abin mamaki a gare ni shi ne yadda.
He wanted what he wanted.	Ya so abin da yake so.
She plans to run with him.	Ta yi shirin gudu da shi.
As soon as we can.	Da wuri kamar yadda za mu iya zuwa.
Things can’t be that way yet.	Abubuwa ba za su iya zama ba tukuna.
However, he still wants to look outside.	Duk da haka, har yanzu yana so ya duba waje.
Many people feel that it is enough.	Mutane da yawa suna jin cewa ya isa.
I stopped fighting it.	Na daina fada da shi.
However, the problem has a way of finding it.	Duk da haka, matsala tana da hanyar gano shi.
We have nothing.	Ba mu da komai.
It will not do well, but then again, it will do nothing.	Ba zai yi kyau ba, amma sai, babu abin da zai yi.
He wants me to stay.	Yana so in zauna.
There he left her without food for three days.	Nan ya bar ta har kwana uku babu abinci.
I can't believe he won.	Ba zan iya yarda ya ci nasara ba.
She doesn't want to laugh now.	Bata son dariya yanzu.
It will come eventually.	Zai zo a ƙarshe.
No one appears to be suitable for another.	Babu wanda ya bayyana da ya dace da wani.
And it's amazing.	Kuma yana da ban mamaki.
The mind takes action and knows how.	Hankali yana ɗaukar aiki kuma ya san yadda.
And it will not stop there.	Kuma ba zai tsaya nan ba.
But it can not be helped.	Amma ba za a iya taimaka ba.
No response.	Ba a ba da amsa ba.
Of course there is good money to be made at that time.	Tabbas akwai kudi masu kyau da za a samu a lokacin.
I will write to her tomorrow.	Zan rubuta mata gobe.
I'm waiting for you.	Ina jiran ku.
He may feel that way.	Yana iya jin haka.
Do it.	Shin shi.
They are easy to cut.	Abu ne mai sauƙi a yanke su.
Just what we did.	Abin da muka yi kawai.
I see you have not been told that.	Na ga ba a ba ku labarin hakan ba.
No you, no game.	A'a ku, babu wasa.
He decided not to try the new restaurant.	Ya yanke shawarar kada ya gwada sabon gidan abincin.
But he just could not.	Amma kawai ba zai iya ba.
Children are hurt.	Yara suna jin rauni.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
I didn't think of anything.	Ban yi tunanin komai ba.
But they did not understand.	Amma ba su gane ba.
You can play this with whatever you want.	Kuna iya wasa da wannan duk abin da kuke so.
Maybe in a year or two.	Wataƙila a cikin shekara ɗaya ko biyu.
Although he had this opportunity, he never used it.	Ko da yake yana da wannan damar, bai taɓa amfani da shi ba.
Off they went.	A kashe suka tafi.
But it is already finished.	Amma ya riga ya gama.
You have already told me your name.	Kun riga kun gaya mani sunan ku.
I like this place.	Ina son wannan wurin.
We will talk about that in the future.	Za mu yi magana game da hakan nan gaba.
You must be.	Dole ne ku kasance.
She doesn't care.	Bata damu da hakan ba.
So do a lot of other people, doing totally a lot less.	Don haka yi da yawa sauran mutane, yin gaba ɗaya mai yawa kasa.
It is difficult to study without water.	Yana da wuya a yi karatu ba tare da ruwa ba.
No one told us anything when we got back here.	Babu wanda ya gaya mana komai lokacin da muka koma nan.
I was alone in the house.	Ni kadai a gidan.
This is all safe and good.	Wannan duk lafiya kuma mai kyau.
Zai.	Zai.
It is not clear why this would help.	Ba a bayyana dalilin da yasa hakan zai taimaka ba.
The man was left with serious injuries.	An bar mutumin da mummunan rauni.
Wait, maybe not one of these.	Jira, watakila ba ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan ba.
She is open to hear your advice.	Ta bude don jin shawarar ku.
He suggests things.	Yana ba da shawarar abubuwa.
The rest of the world has forgotten us.	Sauran duniya sun manta da mu.
I was just there.	Na kasance a can kawai.
It can’t give you the essence, it can just take a lie.	Ba zai iya ba ku ainihin ba, yana iya ɗaukar karya kawai.
When doing something.	Lokacin yin wani abu.
It is all that you are not.	Shi ne duk abin da ba ku kasance ba.
We do the same now.	Haka muke yi yanzu.
This is true for life.	Wannan gaskiya ne ga rayuwa.
She was on the road above you.	Ta kasance a hanya sama da kai.
We ran empty-handed when we ran.	Mun gudu ba tare da komai ba lokacin da muka gudu.
I hope so.	Na yi fatan haka.
So she runs fast, even when she is tired.	Don haka, tana yawan gudu, ko da ta gaji.
But they were.	Amma sun kasance.
I was not.	Ban kasance ba.
It will be difficult to explain.	Zai yi wuya a bayyana.
They all succeeded.	Duk sun yi nasara.
Any place, anytime.	Kowane wuri, kowane lokaci.
For us, money is easy.	A gare mu, kuɗi ne mai sauƙi.
Every time we did it, it was amazing.	A duk lokacin da muka yi shi, abin mamaki ne.
At first, the surprise of the crowd itself.	Da farko, mamakin taron da kansa.
But it does take time.	Amma yana ɗaukar lokaci.
We just have to stop.	Mu kawai za mu daina.
This is not the case anymore.	Wannan ba a'a ba ne kuma.
I know it is.	Na san shi ne.
You are moving fast.	Kuna tafiya da sauri.
Do not kill me.	Kar ku kashe ni.
I was a little surprised to find myself doing that.	Na dan yi mamakin samun kaina na yin haka.
The train is moving.	Jirgin yana tafiya.
She was not the only one to leave.	Lallai ba ita kadai ta tafi ba.
No one is in it.	Babu kowa a ciki.
It takes you there early.	Yana kai ku can da wuri.
Remove it.	Cire shi.
The time is coming.	Lokaci yana zuwa.
He did not want to ask her.	Bai so ya tambaye ta ba.
But no one wanted to see it.	Amma ba wanda ya so ya gani.
I failed a few times.	Na yi kasa sau kadan.
I stopped fighting.	Na daina fada.
I can't accept that now.	Ba zan iya yarda da hakan ba yanzu.
Be with them.	Kasance tare da su.
There are not many people from outside.	Babu mutane da yawa daga waje.
Yet they did not hear.	Amma duk da haka ba su ji ba.
We never knew what to do.	Ba mu taɓa sanin abin yi ba.
You must leave.	Dole ne ku fita.
But because they are not.	Amma saboda ba haka suke ba.
It would be nice to see you.	Zai yi kyau ganin ku.
This is happening as expected.	Wannan yana faruwa kamar yadda aka zata.
She kept trying to get it, though.	Ta yi ta ƙoƙarin samun shi, ko da yake.
You brought it into the world.	Kai ne ka kawo ta duniya.
I have done this before.	Na yi wannan a baya.
However, there it is.	Duk da haka, akwai shi.
He hopes to do the right thing.	Ya yi fatan ya yi abin da ya dace.
He said it was true.	Yace gaskiya ne.
They are married to you.	Sun yi aure ba ku.
This is what will happen now.	Wannan shi ne abin da zai faru a yanzu.
I think now if it seems like the past, it has become a thing of the past.	Ina ganin yanzu idan har ya zama kamar baya, ya zama abin da ya wuce.
Therefore, they failed.	Saboda haka, sun kasa.
And let me explain.	Kuma bari in bayyana hakan.
I am familiar but familiar.	Na saba amma saba.
I feel it now.	Ina jin ta a yanzu.
Amazing and wonderful.	Ban mamaki da ban mamaki.
I doubt you have a lot of money of your own.	Ina shakka kuna da kuɗi da yawa na kanku.
I live a good life.	Ina yin rayuwa mai kyau.
That she was convinced.	Cewa ta tabbata.
It hasn’t changed much.	Ba ta canza da yawa ba.
It certainly is.	Lallai yana da kyau.
We have food to eat.	Muna da abincin da za mu ci.
It’s something for next year, maybe.	Yana da wani abu don shekara ta gaba, watakila.
This does not happen.	Wannan ba ya faruwa.
And everyone seems to have forgotten that.	Kuma da alama kowa ya manta da haka.
I can't speak right now.	Ba zan iya magana ba a yanzu.
We were very difficult.	Mun kasance da wahala sosai.
But things like that do not help you.	Amma abubuwa irin wannan ba su taimaka muku ba.
A good place.	Wani wuri mai kyau.
No, it's not, either.	A'a, ba haka ba ne, kuma.
So they decided to make it work.	Don haka suka yanke shawarar sanya shi aiki.
Work must continue on two tracks.	Dole ne a ci gaba da aiki akan waƙa guda biyu.
Let me tell you to fix it.	Bari in gaya muku ya gyara.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
And she loves it.	Kuma tana son shi.
She tried not to cry.	Ta yi ƙoƙarin kada ta yi kuka.
Only girls.	Yara mata ne kawai.
You never said that to me.	Ba ka taba cewa da ni ba.
I ran and heard.	Na gudu na ji.
I know him very well.	Na san shi sosai.
We got it all.	Mun samu duka.
It can be a little louder, it can be a little louder.	Zai iya zama ɗan ƙara kaɗan, zai iya zama kaɗan kaɗan.
The house itself is amazing.	Gidan da kansa yana da ban mamaki.
It's too big.	Ya yi girma sosai.
So, it was time to pay it off.	Don haka, lokaci ya yi da za a biya shi.
The years are right.	Shekaru sun yi daidai.
Sometimes it works.	Wani lokaci yana aiki.
But if all goes well.	Amma idan komai ya tafi daidai .
And that will be.	Kuma hakan zai kasance.
I will hear them.	Zan ji su.
We changed our lives a lot.	Mun canza rayuwa da yawa.
I tried and tested.	Na gwada kuma na gwada.
But no I do not know what I am.	Amma a'a ban san me nake ba.
Suppose we do not get it.	A ce ba mu samu ba.
And don't stop there.	Kuma kar a tsaya nan kawai.
Eventually made it the most work.	A ƙarshe sanya shi mafi yawan aiki.
He looked up later.	Ya d'aga kai daga baya.
I like delicious food	Ina son abinci mai dadi
And it can be safe.	Kuma yana iya zama lafiya.
What are we going to eat tonight?	Me za mu ci a daren nan?
It is now close.	Yanzu ya kusa.
He had never done this before.	Bai taba yin wannan a baya ba.
When this was published, they did.	A lokacin da aka buga wannan, sun yi.
I can't leave it.	Ba zan iya barin shi ba.
This changed him for the better.	Wannan ya canza masa da kyau.
So much she felt tonight.	Sosai ta ji a daren yau.
It's a great thing.	Abu ne mai girma.
I agree with myself.	Na yarda da kaina.
They want to be so.	Suna son zama haka.
Hey, talk to me.	Kai, magana da ni.
Just walk there at night and catch some.	Kawai tafiya can da dare kuma kama wasu.
Even when we are alone, we are not alone.	Ko a lokacin da muke kadai, ba mu kadai ba.
And what he understood, she understood.	Kuma abin da ya gane, ta gane.
I hope the rain stops.	Ina fata a daina ruwan sama.
Try the food and tell me your thoughts.	Gwada abincin kuma gaya mani tunanin ku.
We paid for it.	Mun biya shi.
Nothing has really changed.	Babu wani abu da ya canza da gaske.
She will love it.	Za ta so shi.
I started to like it very much.	Na fara son shi sosai.
I can kill a person with both pieces.	Zan iya kashe mutumin da duka guda.
I want one night, you want two.	Ina so dare ɗaya, kuna son biyu.
It will not stop.	Ba za ta tsaya ba.
It's hard to go beyond that.	Yana da wuya a wuce wannan.
It is better if you do so.	Yana da kyau idan kun yi haka.
Get a few.	Samu 'yan kaɗan.
And it's good.	Kuma yana da kyau.
I’m glad he did something at home.	Na yi farin ciki da ya yi wani abu a gida.
I feel fine.	Na ji lafiya.
I want to be this man one day.	Ina so in zama mutumin nan wata rana.
They could not find the car.	Sun kasa gano motar.
To do this.	Don ku yi wannan.
But there is more sense.	Amma akwai hankali kuma.
He does not go out.	Ba ya fita.
He will die here.	Zai mutu a nan.
You know, always.	Ka sani, ko da yaushe.
I do not know all this.	Ban san duk wannan ba.
It is the best thing we can do.	Shi ne mafi kyawun abin da za mu iya yi.

Do you study?	Kuna karatu?
But you are also a human being.	Amma kai ma mutum ne.
I can't even break my back.	Ba zan iya ma karya baya ba.
He must find out what the problem is.	Dole ne ya gano menene matsalar.
This is just water here.	Wannan ruwa ne kawai a nan.
Many women say nothing because of fear.	Mata da yawa ba sa cewa komai saboda tsoro.
Money said.	Kudi yace.
Not you, though.	Ba ku, ko da yake.
And don't worry about it.	Kuma kada ka damu da ita.
That just works.	Wannan kawai yana aiki.
He enjoyed a comfortable and easy life.	Ya ji daɗin rayuwa mai daɗi da sauƙi.
But do not say.	Amma kar a ce.
No such work has been tried before.	Ba a taɓa gwada irin wannan aikin ba a baya.
He does not run with anything.	Ba ya gudu da wani abu.
Nice to watch tonight.	Yayi kyau ka kalli daren nan.
I want to know where it came from.	Ina son in san inda ya fito.
And they failed.	Kuma sun kasa.

Maybe they know where she went.	Watakila sun san inda ta tafi.
And there is no reason to be here.	Kuma babu dalilin da ya kamata a nan.
Just to find you.	Kawai don neman ku.
But you are healthy.	Amma kana da lafiya.
I did not leave you in my hands.	Ban bar ku a cikin kaina ba.

Must be worked at night.	Dole ne a yi aiki da dare.
The same is true of you.	Haka yake da ku.
But only two days.	Amma kwana biyu ne kawai.
Few are interested in sleep.	Kadan ne suka yi sha'awar barci.
I'm not used to this, yet.	Ban saba da wannan ba, tukuna.
Continue slowly.	Ci gaba a hankali.
Nothing happened.	Babu wani abu da ya faru.
He did not play any games.	Bai buga ko wane wasa ba.
They are alive.	Suna da rai.
You can do whatever you want.	Kuna iya yin abin da kuke so.
We need you to come with us.	Muna bukatar ku zo tare da mu.
I don't think they know anything.	Bana jin sun san komai.
She is not coming.	Ba ta zuwa.
He had to do something, but nothing useful would do.	Dole ne ya yi wani abu, amma babu wani abu mai amfani da zai yi.
He ate no bread all night.	Ya kwana bai ci abinci ba.
She does not want to go.	Ba ta son tafiya.
I do not think they are.	Ba na tunanin su ne.
Even if you are alone.	Ko da kai kadai ne.
He said he did not and did not speak.	Ya ce bai yi ba kuma ba wata magana.
I don’t know how I would feel about that.	Ban san yadda zan ji game da wannan ba.
But there is no getting it.	Amma babu samun ta.
I was very happy to do that.	Na yi matukar farin ciki da yin hakan.
In fact, people don’t say anything.	A gaskiya, mutane ba su magana ba wani abu ba.
That is the whole story.	Wannan shine duka labarin.
I can't see you.	Ba zan iya ganin ku ba.
This is easily proven.	Ana tabbatar da wannan cikin sauƙi.
The end is near.	Ranar ƙarshe ta kusa.
I think we can take it from here.	Ina tsammanin za mu iya ɗauka daga nan.
I was there twice a month for two years.	Na kasance a wurin sau biyu a wata tsawon shekaru biyu.
I will change.	Zan canza.
We hope, and we send someone to do that.	Muna fata, mu kuma mu aika wani ya yi hakan.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
I let her lie.	Na bar ta ta yi karya.
Good game.	Kyakkyawan wasa.
I'm not sure they will accept me.	Ban tabbata za su yarda da ni ba.
They show up on time.	Sun nuna akan lokaci.
Now let me give you another.	Yanzu bari in ba ku wani.
It's too cold.	Yana da sanyi sosai.
We need it now.	Muna bukata a yanzu.

I'm tired tonight, and I want to sleep.	Na gaji a daren yau, kuma ina son barci.
Let's do things, they say.	Mu yi abubuwa, in ji su.
And that's what's happening.	Kuma abin da ke faruwa ke nan.
I did not hate him.	Ban ƙi shi ba.
He had to get out of there.	Dole ya fita daga wurin.
I got the food I gave her.	Na sami abincin na ba ta.
I said let's get up tonight.	Na ce mu tashi a wannan dare.
We always want to do it more.	Koyaushe muna son mu ƙara yin da shi.
Very good.	Mai kyau sosai.
Many are married and have grown up.	Mutane da yawa sun yi aure kuma sun yi girma.
Everyone does now.	Kowa yayi yanzu.
Please be well and go.	Da fatan za a yi kyau ku tafi.
If you like these, fine.	Idan kuna son waɗannan, lafiya.
Who says anything.	Wanda yake cewa wani abu.
He hit her on the head.	Ya buga mata kai.
He was amazing about the game.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki game da wasan.
They have more chances to get it right.	Suna da ƙarin dama don samun daidai.
Little by little.	Kadan kadan.
I have to be on time for school.	Dole ne in kasance a kan lokacin makaranta.
There is plenty of water, and plenty of food.	Akwai ruwa da yawa, da kayan abinci.
I'm ready.	Na shirya.
She told him she was cold.	Ta gaya masa cewa ta yi sanyi.
They were not in it.	Ba su kasance a ciki ba.
So it could be someone else.	Don haka yana iya zama wani.
It's a place.	Wani wuri ne.
I’m sure we found something wrong there too.	Na tabbata mun sami wani abu ba daidai ba a can ma.
You have no idea.	Ba ku da tunani.
Then continue the game.	Daga nan kuma a ci gaba da wasan.
But that gives us something to work on.	Amma wannan ya ba mu wani abu da za mu yi aiki da shi.
You just grew up.	Ka girma kawai.
Not everyone can do that.	Ba kowa bane zai iya yin hakan.
Some agree with him.	Wasu sun yarda da shi.
He expected all this.	Ya yi tsammanin duk wannan.
So you will not miss any job.	Don haka ba za ku rasa wani aiki ba.
She is familiar with the rich.	Ta saba da masu kudi.
He leaves us.	Yana barin mu.
Call when you say you will call.	Kira lokacin da kuka ce za ku kira.
It has become a symbolic activity.	Ya zama aiki na alama.
All this works, not for nothing.	Duk wannan yana aiki, ba don komai ba.
That will always be true.	Koyaushe hakan zai zama gaskiya.
There is no way he can do that.	Babu yadda zai iya yin hakan.
I think he was joking and didn't know anything.	Ina tsammanin yana wasa ne kuma bai san komai ba.
This car is very fast.	Wannan motar tana da sauri sosai.
He enjoyed a little.	Ya ji daɗi kaɗan.
I don't know why this doesn't work.	Ban san dalilin da yasa wannan baya aiki ba.
They keep going forward.	Suna ci gaba da tafiya gaba.
I will kill you.	Zan kashe ka.
It was good for us.	Yayi mana kyau.
That will certainly not happen.	Babu shakka hakan ba zai faru ba.
They hurried.	Suka yi sauri.
This is a fake story.	Wannan labarin karya ne.
I want to be with people.	Ina son zama tare da mutane.
And do what you know to do.	Kuma ka yi abin da ka san yi.
He was alone.	Ya kasance shi kadai.
I will not walk away from it.	Ba zan yi tafiya daga gare ta ba.
We need to look, to see what we can see.	Muna bukatar mu duba, mu ga abin da za mu iya gani.
She knows that.	Ta san da haka.
But he did not know either.	Amma bai san ko ɗaya ba.
We do not fit them!	Ba mu dace da su ba!
So the story goes.	Don haka labarin ya tafi.
She kept walking.	Ta ci gaba da tafiya.
So something is wrong.	Don haka wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
I can't, so far.	Ba zan iya ba, ya zuwa yanzu.
Turn off the heat!	Kashe zafi!
Whatever she could do.	Duk abin da ta iya yi.
I'm trying to do that like that.	Ina ƙoƙarin yin haka kamar haka.
I can try that later.	Zan iya gwada hakan daga baya.
They will move to a new home next month.	Za su koma wani sabon gida wata mai zuwa.
That said she did what she wanted.	Abin da ya ce ta yi abin da take so.
After many years people have certain expectations.	Bayan shekaru da yawa mutane suna da wasu tsammanin.
I think he did a good job there.	Ina tsammanin ya yi aiki mai kyau a can.
Do not be caught or seen.	Kada a kama ko a gani.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
You do not understand.	Ba ku gane ba.
He could not say.	Ya kasa fada.
The train is fully operational.	Jirgin kasa ya cika aiki.
I don’t know you have to get it.	Ban san dole ka samu ba.
He didn't care, anyway.	Bai damu ba, ta yaya.
The money is gone.	Kudi sun kare.
Maybe there are too many of us.	Wataƙila akwai mu da yawa.
You look amazing, he said.	Ka ga ban mamaki, ya ce.
Take one day at a time.	Ɗauki rana ɗaya a lokaci guda.
This is also a mistake.	Wannan kuma kuskure ne.
The head gets cold and quickly turns cold.	Kan yayi sanyi da sauri ya koma sanyi.
You are not alone.	Ba ku da kawai.
That makes me laugh now.	Wannan yana bani dariya yanzu.
Great run tomorrow.	Babban gudu gobe.
Let's not forget that.	Kar mu manta da haka.
No, it's another.	A'a, wani ne.
It does not show.	Bai nuna ba.
You must go.	Dole ne ku tafi.
I bought this, this, this.	Na sayi wannan, wannan, da wannan.
They should not fix it at all.	Kada su gyara shi gaba ɗaya.
Come with me if you want to live.	Ku zo tare da ni idan kuna son rayuwa.
Of course she knew.	Tabbas ta sani.
You can not succeed.	Ba za ku iya yin nasara ba.
Otherwise it will fail.	In ba haka ba zai yi kasa.
Don't make me do that again.	Kada ka sake sa ni in yi haka.
I do not understand why we do this.	Ban gane dalilin da ya sa muke yin haka ba.
We will return to that at the end of this article.	Za mu koma kan hakan zuwa karshen wannan labarin.
This year they are again.	A bana sun sake.
Later in the day.	Daga baya a ranar.
This is also good.	Wannan kuma yana da kyau.
No one has ever done this to you.	Babu wanda ya taɓa yi maka haka.
A travel book.	Littafin tafiya.
Not at all.	Ba ko kadan ba.
She is still happy.	Har yanzu tana cikin farin ciki.
You are not there yet.	Ba ka can tukuna.
God and us.	Allah da mu.
The train is full.	Jirgin ya cika.
The room itself does.	Dakin da kansa yayi.
I can only say.	Zan iya fada kawai.
They did not see the train coming.	Ba su ga jirgin yana zuwa ba.
And this problem is obvious.	Kuma wannan matsala ta bayyana.
She did it alone.	Ita kadai ta yi.
It is a wonderful way to live.	Hanya ce mai ban mamaki don yin rayuwa.
He loves you so much.	Yana son ku sosai.
I looked at the house.	Na kalli gidan.
More people were found in the second.	An sami ƙarin mutane a cikin na biyu.
Not great to work with, this method is much better.	Ba mai girma don yin aiki ba, wannan hanyar ta fi kyau.
I walk fast.	Ina tafiya da sauri.
He was also able to commit suicide.	Ya kuma iya kashe kansa.
I have to go.	Dole ne in tafi.
No one did.	Babu wanda yayi.
I hope it rained.	Ina fata an yi ruwan sama.
But don't tell him.	Amma kar ka gaya masa haka.
He sighed softly.	Ya fad'a cikin hankali.
However, they are very fast.	Duk da haka, suna gudu sosai.
If you have kids, play from the inside.	Idan kana da yara, yi wasa daga ciki.
But it helped.	Amma ya taimaka.
I don't have a big game.	Ba ni da wani babban wasa.
I do not want to see what my experiences show me.	Ba na son in ga abin da abubuwan da na gani ke nuna mani.
Without a doubt,	Ba tare da shakka ba,
And many weaknesses.	Kuma da yawa rauni.
And you can't do anything.	Kuma ba za ku iya yin komai ba.
This is to put food in it.	Wannan shine don saka abinci a ciki.
From the road.	Daga hanya.
And very pregnant.	Kuma mai ciki sosai.
They were one person.	Sun kasance mutum daya ne.
Items to be sold.	Abubuwan da za a sayar.
Wait.	Jira .
It's simple, really.	Yana da sauƙi, da gaske.
She knew he would not say anything to her.	Ta san ba zai ce mata komai ba.
He has no interests.	Ba shi da abubuwan sha'awa.
She failed to work.	Ta kasa aiki.
No, nothing tonight.	A'a, babu komai a daren yau.
I remember being sick.	Na tuna rashin lafiya.
Fortunately, that will be the case.	Abin farin ciki hakan zai kasance.
It's all from our products.	Duk daga kayan mu ne.
I look forward to working with you.	Na nemi aiki tare da ku.
She never said much about you.	Ba ta taɓa yin magana da yawa game da ku ba.
When money is taken for work.	Lokacin da ake ɗaukar kuɗi don aiki.
The time will come.	Lokaci zai zo.
I just give it a hard time.	Ina ba shi wahala kawai.
I am very useful.	Ina matukar amfani.
People are not prepared for that.	Mutane ba su shirya don haka ba.
It’s still home, but more so.	Har yanzu gida ne, amma ya fi haka.
Maybe they enjoy where they are.	Wataƙila suna jin daɗin inda suke.
This is not the case.	Wannan ba haka bane.
She read the book several times.	Ta karanta littafin sau da yawa.
They never talked about money.	Ba su taɓa yin magana game da kuɗi ba.
He even failed.	Har ma ya kasa.
I want us to be about people.	Ina so mu kasance game da mutane.
Below and.	A kasa kuma.
It's hard to hear this.	Da wuya a ji wannan.
I think this is correct.	Ina tsammanin wannan daidai ne.
It is of no use.	Ba ya da wani amfani.
Despite the cold, the sun was hot.	Duk da sanyi, rana ta yi zafi.
Give them everything they want.	Ka ba su duk abin da suke so.
I can't let it go.	Ba zan iya barin shi ya tafi ba.
We never made much money.	Ba mu taɓa samun kuɗi da yawa ba.
The past has been done.	Abin da ya gabata an yi shi.
It continues to happen because people think it will happen.	Ana ci gaba da faruwa saboda mutane suna tsammanin hakan zai faru.
Whether we need it or not, we must buy it.	Ko muna bukata ko a'a, dole ne mu saya.
After him another.	Bayan shi kuma wani.
She was devastated.	Labarin ya bata mata rai.
I really like it.	Lallai ina son shi.
It's bigger than her, after all.	Ya fi ta girma, bayan haka.
I have them eating well.	Ina da su suna ci da kyau.
It can make any movie interesting.	Zai iya sanya kowane fim mai ban sha'awa.
Just let it go again.	Kawai bari ya tafi kuma.
This is how we should do it.	Wannan shi ne yadda ya kamata mu yi.
It will take some time, you know.	Zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci, ka sani.
It was ridiculous.	Ya zama abin dariya.
That's what we want.	Abin da muke so ke nan.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
No, she did not.	A'a, ba ta yi ba.
This is your last chance.	Wannan shine damar ku ta ƙarshe.
When they are not we enter.	Lokacin da ba su ne muke shiga ba.
They make us feel.	Suna sa mu ji.
What a day.	Menene yau.
The car did not fall to its knees and seemed to be speeding.	Motar ba ta yi kasa a gwiwa ba kuma da alama tana sauri.
Maybe they haven’t read it.	Wataƙila ba su karanta ba.
We have shown that this is not possible.	Mun nuna cewa hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
But they did not care.	Amma ba su damu ba.
How it runs.	Yadda yake gudu.
It looks so good.	Kallon su yayi sosai.
No one knows what the future holds for us.	Babu wanda ya san abin da zai faru nan gaba a gare mu.
Not mine though.	Ba nawa bane ko da yake.
Some will be the right kind of person, some will not.	Wasu za su zama irin mutumin da ya dace, wasu ba za su yi ba.
She was in a trance at first.	Ta kasance cikin rashin hankali da farko.
Any thought food so far, you have to agree.	Duk abincin tunani ya zuwa yanzu, dole ne ku yarda.
Money from them will be needed again next year.	Za a sake buƙatar kuɗi daga gare su a shekara mai zuwa.
Someone laughed at you.	Wani ya baka dariya.
I have to tell you this, fine.	Dole ne in gaya muku wannan, lafiya.
He runs, runs, runs.	Yana gudu, gudu, gudu.
So they decided not to come out.	Don haka suka yanke shawarar ba za su fito ba.
I'm glad you're here with me.	Na yi farin ciki da kuna nan tare da ni.
He did not tell anyone.	Bai gaya wa kowa ba.
It's really funny.	Gaskiya abin dariya ne.
But that did not happen.	Amma hakan bai faru ba.
Life is better again.	Rayuwa ta sake yi kyau.
You can go with whatever you want.	Kuna iya tafiya da duk abin da kuke so.
I can't get enough.	Ba zan iya isa ba.
Today I have to do or die.	Yau abin ya kasance na yi ko a mutu.
And she is not here.	Kuma ba ta nan.
We need to finish this.	Muna bukatar mu gama wannan.
Whatever makes most people happy, is good.	Duk abin da ke sa mafi yawan mutane farin ciki, yana da kyau.
This is something you talk about and worry about.	Wannan wani abu ne da ku ke magana kuma ku damu da shi.
What a man.	Me mutum.
But then the progress came back.	Amma sai ci gaba ya koma.
We just want happiness.	Farin ciki kawai muke so.
Another thought came to her.	Wani tunani ya zo mata.
We have no children.	Ba mu da yara.
I know how to know.	Na san yadda zan sani.
He will not go.	Ba zai tafi ba.
Here is what to do about it.	Ga abin da za a yi da shi.
We do not know what to do.	Ba mu san abin da za mu yi ba.
And he didn't care.	Kuma bai damu ba.
But he knew that was not the case.	Amma ya san cewa ba haka ba ne.

He died at the age of thirty.	Ya mutu shekara talatin.
Someone inside is coming to check out this weekend.	Wani na ciki yana zuwa ya duba wannan karshen mako.
I didn't find anything.	Ban sami komai ba.
She is at work early to prepare for the day.	Tana wurin aiki da wuri don shirya ranar.
This is the first.	Wannan shine na farko.
It will never happen.	Ba zai taba faruwa ba.
Always, everything.	Ko da yaushe, komai.
She looked to her right.	Ta kalli dama ta.
When will this flight depart?	Yaushe wannan jirgin zai tafi?
Just take it.	Kawai dauka.
Maybe even a month.	Wataƙila ko da wata ɗaya.
Traveling by plane was easy.	Tafiya a cikin jirgin sama ya kasance mai sauƙi.
World news.	Labarin duniya.
Pay attention to what you can.	Kula da abin da za ku iya.
This is something new for me.	Wannan sabon abu ne a gare ni.
You must learn to accept them.	Dole ne ku koyi yarda da su.
But not us.	Amma ba mu.
I will never leave here.	Ba zan taba barin nan ba.
It can happen.	Zai iya faruwa.
This failed.	Wannan ya kasa yi.
Want hard.	So da wuya.
She went over to him.	Ta je kan sa.
But it seems to go beyond that.	Amma da alama ya wuce haka.
They agreed to help him.	Suka yarda su taimake shi.
He is not a man.	Shi ba mutum ba ne.
No, nothing has changed.	A'a, babu abin da ya canza.
Sometimes you are behind, sometimes you are ahead.	Wani lokaci kana baya, wani lokacin kuma kana gaba.
No one should do that.	Babu wanda ya isa ya yi haka.
He identified the cause of the illness.	Ya gano dalilin rashin lafiya.
But there is a real fix to this problem.	Amma akwai gyara sosai ga wannan matsalar.
Life is good because it can be missed.	Rayuwa tana da kyau saboda ana iya rasa ta.
He could have told her, but he did not.	Zai iya gaya mata, amma bai yi ba.
He laughed past.	Ya yi dariya suka wuce.
If not, go ahead.	Idan ba haka ba, a ci gaba.
So wrong.	Don haka kuskure.
I myself have not heard anything.	Ni kaina ban ji komai ba.
I did exactly what you said.	Na yi daidai yadda ka ce.
Make no mistake, though.	Kada ku yi kuskure, duk da haka.
They do not speak.	Ba sa magana.
We know where you are.	Mun san inda kuka kasance.
You have known him since the day he bought the place.	Kun san shi tun ranar da ya sayi wurin.
Not there the previous day.	Ba a can ranar da ta gabata ba.
I do not want anything to change.	Ba na son wani abu ya canza.
You are life to me.	Kai ne rayuwa a gare ni.
Tell me the truth now or you will die of pain.	Faɗa min gaskiya yanzu ko za ku mutu da zafi.
He obviously cared about her.	Babu shakka ya damu da ita.
Keep it up.	Ci gaba da shi.
I do not know.	Ban sani ba.
I have to go somewhere.	Dole ne in je wani wuri.
Almost a year has passed.	Kusan shekara guda ta wuce.
Yet he found himself much in need.	Amma duk da haka ya sami kansa da yawa cikin bukata.
Not now or not.	Ba yanzu ko a'a ba.
I did it.	Na yi da shi.
But he was wrong.	Amma ya yi kuskure.
And she will explain that to us.	Kuma za ta bayyana mana hakan.
I almost laughed.	Na kusa yin dariya.
It can do both.	Zai iya yin duka.
Not many times did it happen, but it never did.	Ba sau nawa abu ya faru ba, amma ko ya taɓa faruwa.
People still need to eat.	Har yanzu mutane suna da bukatar ci.
She was very helpful and thoughtful.	Ta kasance mai taimako da tunani sosai.
It's good back there.	Yayi kyau baya can.
At night he swims.	Da dare yana yin iyo.
We must spend the night with her the best day.	Dole ne mu kwana da ita mafi kyawun rana.
One on the road.	Daya a kan hanya.
But some things made her feel uncomfortable.	Amma wasu abubuwa sun sa ta ba ta da daɗi.
But, more people wrote than they thought.	Amma, mutane da yawa sun rubuta fiye da yadda suke tunani.
Water is one of the most useful substances.	Ruwa yana daya daga cikin mafi amfani da abubuwa.
He wanted to be both.	Ya so ya zama duka.
Feel we don't know each other.	Ku ji ba mu san juna ba .
Finally, something functional.	A ƙarshe, wani abu mai aiki.
He is sick.	Ba shi da lafiya.
They will come to you.	Za su zo gare ku.
The program worked well.	Shirin yayi aiki da kyau.
It's really good.	Yana da kyau gaske.
But they got help.	Amma sun sami taimako.
And don’t be a little kid.	Kuma kada ku yi yaro yaro.
He told me to go and tell the others.	Ya ce in je in gaya wa sauran.
Most of them can't walk.	Mafi girma ba za su iya tafiya ba.
But do not touch them.	Amma kar a taba su.
Three people were killed there.	An kashe mutane uku a can.
I think everything is fine except the way we played the game.	Ina ganin komai yayi kyau sai yadda muka buga wasan.
Come back.	Ku dawo.
But we are going well.	Amma muna tafiya lafiya.
The problem is finding them.	Matsalar gano su.
Some people are not involved in this right now.	Wasu mutane ba sa shiga cikin wannan a yanzu.
This is good.	Wannan yana da kyau.
That is your advice.	Wannan shine shawarar ku.
I left her way.	Na bar mata hanya.
Now they are going somewhere.	Yanzu suna zuwa wani wuri.
We do not recommend doing this.	Ba mu ba da shawarar yin wannan ba.
It was a beautiful day.	Rana ce mai kyau sosai.
That will do.	Da za ku yi.
The game has many opportunities.	Wasan yana da damar da yawa.
Life is getting bigger.	Rayuwa ta kara girma.
He seems to want to suffer for himself.	Da alama yana son wahala don kansa.
Do they have money?	Suna da kudi?
Do not pay attention to them.	Kada ku ba da hankali gare su.
They have no children.	Ba su da 'ya'ya.
She got a new supervisor.	Ta sami sabon mai kula.
That should really help.	Ya kamata hakan ya taimaka sosai.
It comes out of the skin.	Ya fita daga fata.
I feel it, long before it happens.	Ina jin shi, tun kafin abin ya faru.
No one laughed.	Ba wanda yayi dariya.
It is the only way for them.	Ita ce kawai hanya a gare su.
She sat there, alone.	Ta zauna a can, ita kadai.
It has never been so interesting to me.	Bai taba zama mai ban sha'awa sosai a gare ni ba.
I don’t want that to get out of hand.	Ba na son hakan ya fita daga hannu.
I was not as usual because of it.	Ban kasance kamar yadda na saba ba saboda shi.
We just talked.	Mun dan yi magana.
They said it was a joy.	Suka ce abin farin ciki ne.
Doing well in school is easy.	Yin kyau a makaranta yana da sauƙi.
They can break the door.	Suna iya karya kofar.
I like reading.	Ina son karatu.
And it's not good.	Kuma ba shi da kyau.
Learn from it.	Koyi da shi.
So.	Don haka.
And before that, another.	Kuma kafin wannan, wani.
They like the very thing.	Suna son ainihin abin.
It is good in this way.	Yana da kyau ta wannan hanya.
There is no help for that.	Babu taimako ga hakan.
This is my favorite book.	Littafin da na fi so shi ne wannan.
Then someone came to help me.	Sai wani ya zo ya taimake ni.
She lived a difficult life.	Ta yi rayuwa mai wahala.
Readers enjoyed the film.	Masu karatu sun ji daɗin fim ɗin.
We need to do our best.	Muna bukatar mu yi mafi kyau.
She is a human being.	Ita mutum ce.
This tells us a few things.	Wannan ya gaya mana 'yan abubuwa.
And we don’t expect them to be.	Kuma ba ma tsammanin za su kasance.
I am the only owner of the house.	Ni kadai ce mai gidan.
I had to go find my own.	Dole na je neman na kaina.
Of course we will not go back when we said we would.	Ba shakka ba za mu koma lokacin da muka ce za mu yi ba.
I worked with him.	Na yi aiki da shi.
I want to go there.	Ina son zuwa can.
Give me some time.	Ka ba ni ɗan lokaci.
Sorry for the rest of the night.	Yi hakuri da sauran daren.
I hear that now.	Na ji haka yanzu.
So it is you.	Don haka kai ne.
That was not the case.	Hakan bai kasance ba.
It's good now.	Ya yi kyau a yanzu.
Come and agree with what they have to say.	Ka zo ka yarda da abin da za su ce.
They want to succeed like everyone else.	Suna son yin nasara kamar kowa.
If this works for some people, it's fine.	Idan wannan yana aiki ga wasu mutane, yana da kyau.
They could not catch her.	Sun kasa kama ta.
He must check.	Dole ne ya duba.
But so far there is no chance at all.	Amma ya zuwa yanzu babu wata dama ko kadan.
That has never been true.	Wannan bai taba zama gaskiya ba.
Maybe he was right.	Wataƙila ya yi daidai.
But he never did anything.	Amma bai taba yin komai ba.
Down there.	A can kasa.
And not right.	Kuma ba daidai ba.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
I'm sure.	Na tabbata.
She felt uncomfortable.	Ta ji babu dadi.
She did not tell me.	Ba ta gaya mani ba.
I want to fight	Ina son yin fada
We watched the movie.	Mun kalli fim.
I saw myself.	Na ga kaina.
This is not a big surprise.	Wannan ba wani babban abin mamaki ba ne.
Yes this decision was for me.	Haka ne wannan shawarar ta kasance a gare ni.
It went right after you did.	Ya tafi daidai bayan kun yi.
I think it is one of the best.	Ina tsammanin yana daya daga cikin mafi kyau.
But they were.	Amma sai suka kasance.
The game started a year ago.	An fara wasan shekara guda a baya.
Number of games.	Yawan wasa.
No one, nothing.	Babu wani, ba komai.
And in everyone.	Kuma a cikin kowa da kowa.
We got this.	Mun samu wannan.
Which is hard.	Abin da ke da wuya.
Let them think again.	Su sake tunani.
They do not look the same.	Ba su yi kama ba.
So be prudent.	Don haka ku zama masu hankali.
It was the first food she needed.	Abinci ne ta fara bukata.
It was easy.	Ya zama mai sauƙi.
It's hard times.	Yana da wuya sau.
This is you for me, I see it.	Wannan shi ne ku a gare ni, ni ga shi.
We suspect he was killed.	Muna zargin cewa an kashe shi.
He did not allow himself to think beyond that.	Bai bar kansa yayi tunanin wuce wannan ba.
But he did not.	Amma bai yi haka ba.
Do not use them.	Kada ku yi amfani da su.
She is still scared.	Har yanzu tana cikin tsoro.
I hope this is a pleasure.	Ina fatan wannan abin farin ciki ne.
He was a little excited.	Ya kasance yana ɗan jin daɗi.
They succeeded.	Sun yi nasara.
They surprised us, but we won.	Sun ba mu mamaki, amma mun ci nasara.
It makes me sick.	Ya yi min rashin lafiya.
He does not want to give up any of this.	Ba ya so ya ba da ko ɗaya daga cikin wannan.
Think like the rest.	Yi tunani kamar sauran.
You will take care of it.	Za ku kula da ita.
I know only time.	Na san lokaci ne kawai.
He did not know how long.	Bai san tsawon lokacin ba.
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work.	Wani lokaci yana aiki kuma wani lokacin ba ya aiki.
But nothing easy here.	Amma babu wani abu mai sauƙi a nan.
Cry, do, you.	Kuka, ku yi, ku.
I can not give you anything.	Ba zan iya ba ku komai ba.
That fascinated me.	Hakan ya bani sha'awa.
So we have to work twice as fast.	Don haka dole mu yi aiki sau biyu cikin sauri.
I like the police	Ina son 'yan sanda
Can you believe that this is the first day of school?	Shin za ku iya yarda cewa wannan ita ce ranar farko ta makaranta?
They want him to come and talk.	Suna so ya zo ya yi magana.
However, everyone makes mistakes.	Duk da haka, kowa yana yin kuskure.
If they don't, that's fine too.	Idan ba su yi ba, hakan ma yayi kyau.
Feel free to feel like we are in for something.	Samu jin daɗin jin cewa muna cikin wani abu.
He would not accept less than that.	Ba zai yarda da kasa da haka ba.
.	.
Fast food often makes fat sick.	Abincin sauri sau da yawa yana da mai da rashin lafiya.
She did not know she was.	Ba ta san ita ce ba.
She killed him.	Ta kashe shi.
He was a child.	Ya kasance yaro.
Otherwise, he said, we will go a long way in the future.	In ba haka ba, in ji shi, za mu ci gaba sosai a baya.
At the time we were happy.	A lokacin muna farin ciki.
He added louder.	Ya ƙara ƙara.
It makes you laugh.	Yana baka dariya.
This will hurt a little.	Wannan zai ɗan yi rauni sosai.
Be careful what you call someone.	Yi hankali da abin da kuke kira wani.
No, they are telling you the story of the teacher, the man.	A'a, suna ba ku labarin malamin, mutumin.
Make a lot of money.	Samun kuɗi da yawa.
Or it could be.	Ko zai iya zama.
First thought, second action.	Tunani na farko, aiki na biyu.
I do not need to read anything.	Bana buƙatar karanta komai.
It is an exciting world.	Duniya ce mai ban sha'awa.
I have known her since she was a child.	Tun tana da girma na san ta.
The rest of us, we live and discover things.	Sauran mu, muna rayuwa kuma mu gano abubuwa.
The first game was very hot.	Wasan farko ya yi zafi sosai.
There is help along the way.	Akwai taimako a hanya.
This works fine.	Wannan yana aiki lafiya.
I understand what is going on.	Na fahimci abin da ke faruwa.
And if she has.	Idan kuma tana da .
I enjoy using them now.	Na ji daɗi da amfani da su yanzu.
I just know him.	Na san shi kawai.
You know that better than anyone else.	Kai ya fi kowa sanin hakan.
I'm glad you stopped.	Na yi farin ciki da ka tsaya.
Often, the cause is unknown.	Sau da yawa, ba a san dalilin ba.
It is weak.	Yana da rauni.
They did not do as he expected.	Ba su yi kamar yadda ya zata ba.
People just don’t get it.	Mutane kawai ba su samu ba.
You look so good.	Da alama kuna da kyau sosai.
He never liked you.	Bai taba son ku ba.
I thought the story made a lot of sense.	Na yi tunanin labarin ya yi tunani sosai.
Everything is enough.	Komai ya isa haka.
Probably better than anyone else.	Wataƙila ya fi kowa.
But it is still an amazing achievement.	Amma har yanzu nasara ce ta ban mamaki.
Please check it now to start earning money.	Da fatan za a duba shi yanzu don fara samun kuɗi.
They are only two now.	Su biyu ne kawai yanzu.
Everyone who came to stay with us.	Duk wanda ya zo ya zauna tare da mu.
You can't tell anyone.	Ba za ku iya gaya wa kowa ba.
It is done.	Ana yi.
Appropriate name.	Sunan da ya dace.
We want her to be happy.	Muna son ta yi farin ciki.
We have done this many times.	Mun yi haka sau da yawa.
I said no.	Na ce a'a.
She reached out her hand in response.	Ta kai hannu da hannu ta amsa.
There is no life from it, no happiness.	Babu rayuwa daga gare ta, babu farin ciki.
It's a simple thing.	Wani abu ne mai sauƙi.
So they stopped talking to me.	Haka suka daina min magana.
I'll check them out.	Zan duba su.
And that's about it.	Kuma shi ke nan game da shi.
The world is beautiful.	Duniya tana da kyau.
The gameplay is really good.	Wasan wasa yana da kyau sosai.
Remember again.	Tuna kuma .
It's so amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki sosai.
They thought.	Suka yi tunani.
It's amazing to me.	Yana da ban mamaki a gare ni.
Tell me something new.	Fada mani wani sabon abu.
That did not help.	Hakan bai taimaka ba.
Feel something has come out.	Ji yayi wani abu ya fita.
She spoke well.	Ta yi magana mai kyau.
But we still can't find the place.	Amma har yanzu ba mu iya gano wurin ba.
The way out, he said.	Hanyar fita, ya ce.
But she did not tell you the truth.	Amma bata gaya maka gaskiya ba.
To work, not knowing what the day will bring.	Zuwa aiki, ba tare da sanin abin da ranar za ta kawo ba.
Now it is clear.	Yanzu ya tabbata.
While this is good, we can still do better.	Duk da yake wannan yana da kyau, har yanzu muna iya yin mafi kyau.
Curious about the unknown.	Son sani game da wanda ba a sani ba.
You are so beautiful.	Kuna da kyau sosai.
Nothing has changed.	Babu wani abu da ya canza.
She won't.	Ba za ta yi ba.
And not often.	Kuma ba sau da yawa ba.
You must pay now.	Dole ne ku biya yanzu.
Try it early.	Gwada shi da wuri.
I know they no longer live there.	Na san ba su ƙara zama a can ba.
Some people never think beyond that time.	Wasu mutane ba su taɓa tunanin wuce wannan lokacin ba.
He regained his composure.	Ya dawo da tunani.
Whatever happened, they knew.	Duk abin da ya faru, sun sani.
My own son once told me.	Dan ni kaina ya taba fada min.
It's over.	Ya wuce.
We never saw or heard who they were talking to.	Ba mu taɓa ganin ko jin wanda suke magana da su ba.
They only come to me.	Suna zuwa gare ni kawai.
I did not succeed very well with my last attempt.	Ban yi nasara sosai ba tare da ƙoƙari na na ƙarshe.
We have two things to consider first.	Muna da abubuwa biyu da za mu kula da farko.
Not me now.	Ba ni yanzu.
That is why we are here.	Shi ya sa muke nan.
It was a happy time.	Abin farin ciki ne a lokacin.
Immediately, he left.	Nan da nan, ya tafi.
To get it in three things is amazing.	Don samun shi a cikin abubuwa uku yana da ban mamaki.
They are the same car.	Mota daya suke.
You can take it as given.	Kuna iya ɗauka kamar yadda aka ba ku.
But it was not added.	Amma ba a kara ba.
And it should be good.	Kuma ya kamata ya kasance da kyau.
I just want my life.	Ina son rayuwa ta kawai.
What kind of food, how much food.	Wani irin abinci, nawa abinci.
They have children.	Suna da yara.
But he can not.	Amma ba zai iya ba.
It is nothing new.	Ba sabon abu ba ne.
You have imitated them.	Kun yi koyi da su.
I am a thoughtful person.	Ni mutum ne mai tunani.
So sometimes it can be funny.	Don haka wani lokacin yana iya zama abin ban dariya.
The plane took off.	Jirgin ya tashi sama.
Eating it alive.	Cin shi da rai.
It worked during that time.	Ya yi aiki a wannan lokacin.
We hope you enjoy working with us !.	Muna fatan kuna jin daɗin aiki tare da mu!.
We do not know how or why.	Ba mu san ta yaya ko me yasa ba.
Every home has a front door.	Kowane gida yana da kofar gida.
That is why she is on her way now.	Hakan yasa take kan hanya a yanzu.
You want two people to like it equally.	Kuna son mutane biyu su so shi daidai.
This requires a lot of effort.	Wannan yana buƙatar ƙoƙari sosai.
Later, he will realize that he did not want to know.	Daga baya, zai gane cewa bai so ya sani ba.
It's been a day or two.	Kwana daya ko biyu kenan.
Stop whatever you are doing.	Tsaya duk abin da kuke yi.
It will take some getting used to.	Zai ɗauki wasu yin amfani da su.
I think you heard that.	Ina tsammanin kun ji haka.
You are all very tired.	Ku duka kun gaji sosai.
We do not work.	Ba mu aiki.
However, nothing was done to finish it or sell it.	Duk da haka, ba a yi wani abu don gama shi ko sayar da shi ba.
I will not lose myself as the others did.	Ba zan rasa kaina ba kamar yadda sauran suka yi.
Then just check if you are already finished.	Bayan haka kawai duba idan kun riga kun gama.
He wanted to go to school.	Ya so ya tafi makaranta.
Until last night.	Har daren jiya.
Everything in the world is in front of me.	Duk abin da ke duniya gaba da ni ne.
There are three women.	Akwai mata uku.
Or 'just'.	Ko 'kawai'.
He could not understand it.	Ya kasa gane hakan.
There are three of us three girls to enjoy.	Akwai guda uku mu 'yan mata uku mu ji daɗi.
I can't do them.	Ba zan iya yin su ba.
In the sky.	A cikin sama.
Best way.	Mafi kyau ta hanya.
Like it or not.	Kuna so ko ba ku so.
And he knows me.	Kuma ya san ni.
You will get a job again.	Za ku sake samun aiki.
That people saw this happen.	Cewa mutane sun ga wannan ya faru.
I will do the right thing.	Zan yi abin da ya dace.
No one in the place could see her.	Ba kowa a wurin da ta iya gani.
He thought he could help.	Ya yi tunanin zai iya taimaka.
Go get one.	Je ka samu daya.
They were honest.	Sun kasance masu gaskiya.
It made me feel good.	Tunani ya yi min kyau.
We will see about that.	Za mu gani game da hakan.
There was no food either.	Babu abinci ma.
It was a happy time for everyone.	Lokaci ne na farin ciki ga kowa.
Not checked once.	Bata duba sau daya ba.
I agreed to help them with that.	Na yarda in taimake su akan hakan.
We were surprised.	Mun yi mamaki.
We have oil.	Muna da mai.
Everything works independently to get the job done.	Duk abin da ke aiki da kai don samun aikin.
We just play.	Muna wasa kawai.
But you know.	Amma ka sani,.
There is a problem with it somewhere.	Akwai matsala game da shi a wani wuri.
The time has come.	Lokaci ya zo.
And that's it.	Kuma shi ke nan.
He plays everything.	Yana wasa komai.
We want to be happy.	Muna so mu yi farin ciki.
He too could not, but he wanted to.	Shi ma ba zai iya ba, amma ya so.
No such thing happened later here.	Babu irin wannan abin da ya faru daga baya a nan.
But personally.	Amma da kaina.
Or he won't.	Ko kuma ba zai yi ba.
However, you do not see any.	Duk da haka, ba ku ga ko ɗaya ba.
At first she was not really liked.	Da farko ba a son ta sosai.
I do not know what to do.	Ban san abin da za a yi ba.
About a lot of things.	Game da abubuwa da yawa.
I sat next to her.	Na zauna kusa da ita.
If you want, we can do it here.	Idan kuna so, za mu iya yin shi a nan.
The players are ready for that.	'Yan wasan sun shirya don haka.
This is not a mistake.	Wannan ba kuskure ba ne.
Opportunity to hear.	Damar ji.
After that, we corrected.	Bayan haka, mun gyara.
He would not have done it.	Da ma bai yi ba.
What he drank will be difficult for everyone.	Abin da ya sha zai kasance da wahala ga kowa.
It was a good trip.	Tafiya ce mai kyau.
They really care about that kind of thing.	Suna jin da gaske game da irin wannan abu.
They understood the way.	Sun fahimci hanyar.
They will not let me go.	Ba za su bar ni in tafi ba.
This is a job.	Wannan wani aiki ne.
It was good then.	Yana da kyau a lokacin.
I can confirm that they broke it.	Zan iya tabbatar da cewa sun karya shi.
Yet this moment continues to happen to me.	Amma duk da haka wannan lokacin ya ci gaba da faruwa da ni.
This is another one from this purchase.	Wannan wani ne daga wannan siyan.
They did a great job.	Sun yi babban aiki.
It's hard to see.	Yana da wuya a gani.
But no, there is.	Amma a'a, akwai shi.
In the end, everyone decides for themselves.	A ƙarshe, kowa yana yanke shawarar kansa.
The furniture in the house.	Kayan da ke cikin gidan.
They can not be.	Ba za su iya zama ba.
Some are scary.	Wasu suna ba da ban tsoro.
He could not walk it.	Bai iya tafiya ba ita ba.
Very nice place.	Wuri mai kyau sosai.
However, this is not necessarily true.	Duk da haka, wannan ba lallai ba ne gaskiya.
Can anyone tell me how to fix it.	Shin kowa zai iya gaya mani yadda zan gyara shi.
No one wants to do this job.	Babu wanda ke son yin wannan aikin.
You talk when you should not.	Kuna magana lokacin da bai kamata ba.
Another mistake.	Wani kuskure.
She thought maybe this was the man.	Ta yi tunanin watakila ita ce wannan mutumin.
So it went out.	Haka ya fita.
This will work for me.	Wannan zai yi aiki a gare ni.
Heads up.	A kula.
They will not run away.	Ba za su gudu ba.
They looked at each other.	Suka kalli juna.
I doubt, but maybe.	Ina shakka, amma watakila.
You talk to them better.	Kuna magana da su mafi kyau.
I will not go.	Ba zan tafi ba.
Go tonight.	Ku tafi daren yau.
But if you can, make it work for you.	Amma idan za ku iya, sanya shi aiki a gare ku.
I hope you understand and know this.	Ina fatan kun gane kuma ku san wannan.
One you like.	Daya da kuke so.
He even allowed to play both games on his own.	Har ma ya ba da damar yin wasan biyu da kansa.
Everything appears to be going well.	Komai ya bayyana yana tafiya lafiya.
They did everything they could to do it.	Sun yi duk abin da ba daidai ba da za su iya yi.
I do not want to let anyone fail.	Ban so in bar kowa ya kasa.
What? 	Menene?
She said.	Ta ce.
In fact, he does not drive.	A gaskiya, ba ya tuƙi.
I am very tired of them.	Na gaji da su sosai.
I think so.	Ina tunanin hakan.
We are behind each other.	Muna da bayan juna.
It changes all your way of seeing the world.	Yana canza duk hanyar ku na ganin duniya.
The car sped off.	Motar ta dauki sauri.
It still looks like the future.	Har yanzu yana kama da gaba.
God has given me.	Allah ya bani.
They were left alone.	Aka bar su.
Now, of course, we know better.	Yanzu, ba shakka, mun fi sani.
He did not laugh.	Bata dariya.
But this can happen.	Amma wannan na iya faruwa.
You are all laughing.	Ku duka kuna dariya.
And so it can be.	Kuma haka zai iya.
As usual as.	Kamar yadda aka saba kamar da.
She would not ask if she was OK.	Ba za ta tambayi ko lafiya ba.
But it is better.	Amma ya fi.
One is, try it and see.	Daya shine, gwada shi ku gani.
Just the day before.	Kamar ranar da ta gabata.
What she said, how she put things.	Abin da ta ce, yadda ta sanya abubuwa.
Maybe.	Wataƙila.
They have to do better than they really are.	Dole ne su yi kyau fiye da yadda suke.
We are waiting to see another project.	Muna jiran ganin wani aiki.
Don't leave the rod!	Bata barin sanda!.
We should do the same.	Ya kamata mu yi haka.
I really think it will do me good.	Lallai ina ganin zai yi min kyau.
You have to deal with it every day.	Dole ne ku yi aiki da shi kowace rana.
Maybe he brought me something.	Watakila ya kawo min wani abu.
Now, we can see what works and what doesn't.	A yanzu, za mu iya ganin abin da ke aiki da abin da ba ya aiki.
It just gets the game out of the way.	Yana kawai samun wasa daga wannan hanya.
Think today.	Ka yi tunani a yau.
As you wish.	Kamar yadda kuke so.
Obviously, he did not.	Babu shakka, bai yi haka ba.
I do not want to hear.	Ba na son ji.
However, no one will be found here.	Duk da haka, babu wanda za a samu a nan.
It is not so.	Ba haka yake ba.
Anyway.	Duk da haka hanya.
It will be done.	Haka za a yi.
Let me kiss you.	Bari in bata ku.
However he did not speak to me again.	Duk da haka bai sake yin magana da ni ba.
He could not save it.	Ya kasa ajiye shi.
So, whatever you do.	Don haka, duk abin da kuke yi.
And it just reached you.	Kuma kawai ta kai maka.
You will have a great day tomorrow.	Za ku yi babban rana gobe.
She plans a trip with the person she loves.	Ta shirya tafiya da mutumin da take son su.
There is nothing to be done about it.	Babu wani abu da za a yi game da shi.
You told me she understood.	Kun ce min ta gane.
I'm afraid you do not understand.	Ina tsoron kar ku gane.
I have it.	Ina da shi.
In fact fear is ‘now’.	A gaskiya tsoro shine 'yanzu'.
She will use that.	Za ta yi amfani da hakan.
You can't be laughed at.	Ba za a iya yi muku dariya ba.
And it can be.	Kuma yana iya zama.
But nothing was done.	Amma ba a yi komai ba.
That sounds good.	Hakan yayi kyau.
Absolutely.	Lallai.
They run away from it, very quickly.	Suna gudu daga gare ta, da sauri.
Then the door opened and closed.	Sai kofar gidan ta bude ta rufe.
The food works.	Abincin yana aiki.
I should help with that.	Ya kamata in taimaka da hakan.
That's why we laughed.	Shi ya sa muka yi dariya.
The name she recognizes and doesn’t have much.	Sunan sunan da ta gane kuma ba ta da yawa.
As such there are not many mistakes made.	Kamar yadda yake ba a yi kuskure da yawa ba.
Look at this ship.	Ku kalli wannan jirgin.
I was very happy.	Na yi farin ciki sosai.
It quickly filled with people.	Da sauri ta cika da mutane.
Kill him is not spoken.	Kashe shi ba a magana.
I came here.	Na zo nan.
It rained a lot at night.	Ruwan ruwa ya yi yawa a daren.
It is a way of buying time, to concentrate.	Hanya ce ta siyan lokaci, don mai da hankali.
It is a pleasure to have them all here.	Abin farin ciki ne samun su duka a nan.
So we will lose the house.	Don haka za mu rasa gidan.
Whether or not seen will be more accurate.	Ko ba a gani ba zai zama mafi daidai.
But it makes me.	Amma yana sa ni.
Not this one either.	Ba wannan ma.
Start by preparing the fish.	Fara da shirya kifi.
He has three children.	Yana da yara uku.
Think it is not you.	Ka yi tunanin ba kai ba ne.
Little has changed.	Kadan ya canza.
I'm sure everyone does.	Na tabbata cewa kowane mutum yana yi.
So we set off for work.	Don haka muka tashi aiki.
They like to play.	Suna son yin wasa.
It's so amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki sosai.
Your head is up.	Kan ku ya tashi.
The night we started.	Da dare muka fara.
Do not be interested or reluctant.	Kada ku yi sha'awar ko ku ƙi.
Make sure the location is appropriate.	Tabbatar cewa wurin ya dace.
It's so amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki sosai.
He came and went.	Ya zo ya tafi.
Ask me first, and wait for me to answer.	Ka tambaye ni da farko, kuma ka jira in amsa.
Second, she did not drink coffee.	Na biyu kuma, ba ta sha kofi ba.
And then people want to be in it.	Kuma sai mutane suka so su kasance cikin sa.
I do not know when it came out.	Ban san lokacin da ya fito ba.
The main problem is the users.	Babban matsala shine masu amfani.
He still could not understand.	Har yanzu ya kasa gane.
Now, let's do this right.	Yanzu, bari mu yi wannan daidai.
I have never seen one.	Ban taba ganin daya ba.
Sorry it was not good, she said.	Yi hakuri abin bai yi kyau ba, ta ce.
I feel everything.	Ina jin komai.
I know it's my turn.	Na san lokaci nawa ne.
Things happen the way they do.	Abubuwa suna faruwa yadda suke faruwa.
They will not buy anything.	Ba za su sayi komai ba.
That was the first thought.	Tunani na farko kenan.
It turned out to be a very simple one.	Ya zama mai sauƙi mai sauƙi.
The doctor agreed.	Likitan ya yarda.
Let them speak.	Su yi magana.
Maybe they have a financial problem.	Wataƙila sun sami matsala ta kuɗi.
There is though.	Akwai ko da yake.
And now.	Kuma yanzu.
Without the person.	Ba tare da mutumin ba.
But do not try to give it to me.	Amma kada ka yi ƙoƙari ka ba ni.
He was against the police.	Ya kasance a kan 'yan sanda.
Feel the missed opportunity.	Jin damar da aka rasa.
I want you to come.	Ina so ku zo.
I never wanted it to end.	Ban taba son ya kare ba.
We need to reject such things.	Muna bukatar mu ƙi irin waɗannan abubuwa.
That is not right.	Hakan bai yi daidai ba.
Wearing clothes to wear is not easy.	Sa kayan da za ta saka ba shi da sauƙi.
I can put this as you wrote.	Zan iya sanya wannan kamar yadda kuka rubuta.
You will love it.	Za ku so shi.
Life is life, food is there.	Rayuwa ita ce rayuwa, abinci yana nan.
He did not want to be.	Bai so ya zama.
It is a very difficult job.	Aiki ne mai matukar wahala.
She knew she was beautiful.	Ta san tana da kyau.
I never found out what happened next.	Ban taba gano abin da ya faru bayan haka ba.
Always put school work before anything else.	Koyaushe sanya aikin makaranta a gaba kafin wani abu.
Are you going to meet the big one.	Shin je ku hadu da babban.
In the morning it was not so.	Da safe ba haka ba.
We would be interested in just thinking of home.	Za mu yi sha'awar tunanin gida ne kawai.
Hot water filled the room.	Ruwan zafi ya cika dakin.
Not necessary, too.	Ba dole ba, kuma.
Focus on the positive aspects of your trip.	Ka mai da hankali kan abubuwa masu kyau na tafiya.
He does not need an answer.	Ba ya bukatar amsa.
I have high hopes.	Ina da kyakkyawan fata.
I don't think he will get involved, myself.	Bana jin zai shiga ciki, ni kaina.
Maybe it's just talk.	Wataƙila magana ce kawai.
No doubt what she heard.	Babu shakka abin da ta ji.
We always carry these things.	Muna ɗaukar waɗannan abubuwa koyaushe.
The things we have.	Abubuwan da muke da su.
Hope no one is hurt.	Da fatan babu wanda ya ji rauni.
She too died.	Ita ma haka ta mutu.
We need to play better here.	Muna bukatar mu yi wasa mafi kyau a nan.
She has known this for years.	Ta san wannan tsawon shekaru.
I do not care about your name.	Ban damu da sunan ku ba.
I don't like it.	Ban so shi.
It's too hot.	Ya yi zafi sosai.
Sometimes the two are seen together.	Wani lokaci ana ganin duka biyu tare.
Inside you understand the time of travel.	A ciki ka fahimci lokacin tafiya yayi.
He began to run.	Ya fara gudu.
They, too, cannot hear him.	Su ma ba za su iya jin sa ba.
It is a need of total attention for any thinker.	Bukatar rashin hankali ce gaba ɗaya ga kowane mai tunani.
So it looked really good.	Don haka ya yi kyau sosai.
Everything works well together.	Komai yana aiki da kyau tare.
They will not help you.	Ba za su taimake ku ba.
I will get back to you.	Zan dawo gare ku.
Here she will die.	A nan za ta mutu.
The number of women has run very high.	Yawan mata ya yi gudu sosai.
He immediately opened them again.	Nan da nan ya sake bude su.
You want to ask them.	Kuna so ku tambaye su.
I always go forward.	Ina tafiya gaba koyaushe.
I knew he needed me.	Na san yana bukata na.
And it keeps growing.	Kuma yana ci gaba da girma.
I have to sleep.	Dole ne in yi barci.
This is the job he wants.	Wannan shine aikin da yake so.
You will be healthier.	Za ku fi lafiya.
They used and installed equipment.	Sun yi amfani da kuma sanya kayan aiki.
She told me to come immediately.	Ta ce in zo nan da nan.
Everyone loves surprises.	Kowa yana son abubuwan mamaki.
And get someone there to tell you that.	Kuma a sami wani a can ya gaya muku haka.
Some had trouble getting up.	Wasu sun sami matsala ta tashi.
And you should change the water every day.	Kuma ya kamata ku canza ruwa kowace rana.
They for it.	Su don shi.
You man get up.	Kai mutum tashi.
But somehow she failed.	Amma ko ta yaya ta kasa.
We do not accept these conclusions.	Ba mu yarda da waɗannan ƙarshe ba.
This decision was rejected.	An ƙi wannan shawarar.
Don’t worry, much more than where it came from.	Kada ku damu, da yawa fiye da inda abin ya fito.
I didn’t get close to him until I realized.	Ban yi kusa da shi ba har na sani.
It may even be early.	Yana iya ma zama da wuri.
I am, you know.	Ni ne, ka sani.
But they do more than protect children.	Amma suna yin fiye da kare yara.
It looks so good on her.	Yayi mata kyau sosai.
She waited to say something.	Ta jira ya ce wani abu.
Still without success.	Har yanzu ba tare da nasara ba.
There are some things you should never do near doing them.	Akwai wasu abubuwan da ba za ku taɓa yin kusa da yin su ba.
We are making good money now.	Muna samun kuɗi mai kyau yanzu.
She was very interesting.	Ta kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
Everyone every day.	Kowane mutum a kowace rana.
You should do it early.	Ya kamata ku yi shi da wuri.
It will be one of the years.	Zai zama ɗaya daga cikin shekaru.
Touch it.	Taba shi.
Sometimes they are right.	Wani lokaci suna da gaskiya.
I want to.	Na son rai ne.
It can be very useful.	Zai iya zama da amfani sosai.
Now, we have it.	Yanzu, muna da shi.
This is not the first or the last.	Wannan ba shi ne na farko ko na ƙarshe ba.
We must.	Dole ne mu.
The world is what it is.	Duniya ita ce abin da yake.
She came out wanting to talk to me but I left.	Ta fito tana son yi min magana amma na tafi.
Now, let me help you.	Yanzu, bari in taimake ku.
He has always been interested in such an event.	Ya kasance yana sha'awar irin wannan taron.
But these are sold slowly.	Amma waɗannan sun sayar a hankali.
This did not help.	Wannan bai taimaka ba.
There are two people on the dock.	Mutane biyu ne a kan tashar jirgin ruwa.
He went out at night.	Ya fita cikin dare.
I would recommend trying it out.	Zan ba da shawarar gwada shi.
He was out of place.	Ya kasance daga wurin.
However, he remained in the game.	Duk da haka, ya zauna a wasan.
He did not.	Bai yi ba.
He said nothing.	Bai ce komai ba.
It will not rise.	Ba za ta tashi ba.
He was immediately exhausted.	Nan take ya gaji.
I don't even know her.	Ban ma san ta ba.
He knew nothing.	Bai san komai ba.
Maybe that's what we're seeing.	Wataƙila abin da muke gani ke nan.
I wonder when this will happen.	Ina mamakin yaushe wannan zai faru.
They went early for the game.	Sun tafi da wuri don wasan.
It is not enough.	Bai isa ba .
I'll be in the car.	Zan kasance a cikin motar.
The place is amazing too.	Wurin yana da ban mamaki kuma.
Hope you are well.	Da fatan kuna lafiya.
We started with these and they are amazing.	Mun fara waɗannan kuma suna da ban mamaki.
There is an unpleasantness.	Akwai wani rashin jin daɗi.
Go where he wants you to go.	Zuwa inda yake so ku je.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a san abin da suka gani ba.
They entered the room.	Dakin suka shiga.
Only a child.	Yaro ne kawai.
It's nothing.	Bata ce komai ba.
You have to find something interesting.	Dole ne ku sami abin sha'awa.
Put it there.	Sanya shi a can.
Your thinking will change.	Tunanin ku zai canza.
But many of us cannot do that.	Amma mu da yawa ba za mu iya yin hakan ba.
I am a dog	Ni ne kare
And mine.	Kuma nawa.
From that moment on, you are mine.	Tun daga wannan lokacin, kai nawa ne.
There is little they can do.	Akwai kadan da za su iya yi.
You can come with me if you want.	Kuna iya zuwa tare da ni idan kuna so.
It hurts a lot.	Yayi masa zafi sosai.
Here is another one.	Ga kuma wani daga wuri guda.
He is married and has two children.	Yana da aure yana da ’ya’ya biyu.
No one has anything.	Babu wanda yake da komai.
It's a little crocodile.	Ya dan kada mata.
Just someone waited.	Kamar wani ya jira.
He died instantly.	Nan take ya mutu.
The one who pays will do it.	Wanda zai biya ya yi.
But look in the car.	Amma duba cikin mota.
And on.	Kuma a kan.
Go!	Tafi!
I do not want	Ban so
At school.	A makaranta.
It is better in man.	Ya fi kyau a cikin mutum.
Upcoming events.	Abubuwan da ke zuwa.
Whether you have the time, it is something.	Ko kuna da lokaci, wani abu ne.
She felt that this was not right.	Ta ji cewa hakan ba zai dace ba.
But not for this game.	Amma ba don wannan wasan ba.
In the future they will come to me.	Nan gaba za su zo nawa.
He immediately knew that it had to be true.	Nan take ya san cewa dole ya zama gaskiya.
This is because of the work they do.	Wannan ya kasance saboda aikin da suka yi.
Almost everyone hates them.	Kusan kowa ya ƙi su.
It is still in progress.	Har yanzu yana kan ci gaba.
That’s if it doesn’t go faster than what we’ve seen.	Shi ke nan idan bai yi sauri fiye da abin da muka gani ba.
At one point he thought it was funny.	A wani lokaci ya yi tunanin abin dariya ne.
I am not telling you to do this.	Ba ina gaya muku ku yi wannan ba.
I'm talking about fish.	Ina magana da kifi.
Of course she did not get it.	Tabbas ba ta samu ba.
I love it even this way.	Ina son shi har ma ta wannan hanya.
There is no such thing as intelligence.	Babu wani abu kamar hankali.
It's coming for a while.	Yana zuwa dan lokaci kadan.
This will be bigger and better.	Wannan zai zama mafi girma kuma mafi kyau.
What you feel is a lack of help.	Abin da kuke ji shine rashin taimako.
This, however, is unlikely to happen.	Wannan, duk da haka, da wuya ya faru.
He does not need to.	Ba ya bukata.
I will not pass.	Ba zan wuce ba.
Just to do it all over again.	Kawai don sake yin shi duka.
He grew up with her.	Yayi mata girma.
But it is a great place.	Amma babban wuri ne.
They will arrest others.	Za su kama wasu.
These change everything.	Waɗannan suna canza komai.
They are not very good.	Ba su da kyau sosai.
One can think of many opportunities.	Mutum na iya tunanin dama da dama.
And it can be a mistake.	Kuma yana iya zama kuskure.
They must have suffered.	Lallai sun sha wahala.
None of this seems to have helped him in this regard.	Babu wani daga cikin wannan da alama ya taimaka masa da hakan.
I enjoy everything about it.	Ina jin daɗin komai game da shi.
I still have a lot of work to do.	Har yanzu ina da aiki sosai.
And they will never be able to go out.	Kuma ba za su taba iya fita ba.
You can't get bigger than that.	Ba za ku iya samun girma fiye da wannan ba.
You are completely honest.	Kuna da gaskiya gaba ɗaya.
He made a mistake.	Ya yi kuskure.
And that's what you do now.	Kuma abin da kuke yi ke nan a yanzu.
You can't let that get into you.	Ba za ku iya barin hakan ya shiga cikin ku ba.
What we want is what happens after she goes here.	Abin da muke so shine abin da ke faruwa bayan ta tafi a nan.
It's time to dump her.	Lokaci yayi na aiki.
But they had to.	Amma sun yi dole.
So there is no problem there.	Don haka babu matsala a can.
That is not fair.	Hakan bai dace ba.
Something about the man.	Wani abu game da mutumin.
Actually immediately after dinner.	A gaskiya nan da nan bayan abincin dare.
They are not for children.	Ba na yara bane.
I do not know them all.	Ban san su duka ba.
It's hard to open.	Yana da wuya a bude.
He did not call the police.	Bai kira 'yan sanda ba.
Maybe they are all interested.	Wataƙila duka suna sha'awar.
I like to make people laugh when they are in a bad day.	Ina son in ba wa mutum dariya lokacin da suke cikin mummunan rana.
He begins to cry.	Ya fara kuka.
She used to love reading.	Ta kasance tana son karatu.
They may think.	Suna iya tunanin.
We will all be happy.	Mu duka za mu yi farin ciki.
When you win, be a good player.	Lokacin da kuka yi nasara, ku kasance wasa mai kyau.
And just hot, and hot.	Kuma kawai zafi, da zafi.
He really knows the game.	Da gaske ya san wasan.
I made our two coffee cups.	Na sanya mu biyu kofi kofi.
That will close soon.	Hakan zai rufe nan da nan.
Remember that.	Ka tuna cewa .
You know everything, but you know nothing.	Kun san komai, amma ba ku san komai ba.
Just a short bus ride.	Tafiya kaɗan kawai ta bas.
You are on your way up and down here.	Kuna kan hanya sama da kan ku a nan.
To touch it.	Don taba shi.
And he sends it.	Kuma yana aika shi.
We can grow with them.	Za mu iya girma tare da su.
You are not here.	Ba ka nan.
It will not rise.	Ba zai tashi ba.
His head hurts a lot.	Kansa yayi zafi sosai.
Too much, too much.	Da yawa, da yawa.
Bring me home.	Kawo ni gida.
Eating a lot.	Cin abinci mai yawa.
I'm not sure if that can do anything with it.	Ban tabbata ko hakan na iya yin wani abu da shi ba.
I realized it was true.	Na gane gaskiya ne.
But he seemed to be surprised.	Amma ya yi kamar ya yi mamaki.
That would be nice.	Wannan zai yi kyau.
She was immediately killed.	Nan take aka kashe ta.
And now that has happened.	Kuma yanzu wannan ya faru.
Talk about cold.	Yi magana game da sanyi.
I'm not sure it's right.	Ban tabbata ba daidai ba ne.
The rain stopped.	Ruwan sama ya daina.
Not everyone can do what you do.	Ba kowa ba ne zai iya yin abin da kuke yi.
I can catch him.	Zan iya kama shi.
It's a joke, nothing more.	Abin wasa ne, babu wani abu kuma.
Just tell me what’s happening to you.	Kawai gaya mani abin da ke faruwa da ku.
I play well	Ina wasa da kyau
The door is open.	An bude kofar.
I think the man is married.	Ina tsammanin mutumin yayi aure.
The water is cold.	Ruwan yayi sanyi.
As it turns out, it could be.	Kamar yadda ya bayyana, yana iya zama.
I have no real pleasure.	Ba ni da wani jin daɗi na gaske.
I was able to fix the problem.	Na sami damar gyara matsalar.
He will go and see.	Zai je ya duba.
Missed, not really.	An rasa, ba da gaske ba.
Everything was really, really, really.	Duk abin ya kasance da gaske, da gaske, da gaske.
But people are buying.	Amma mutane suna saya.
I immediately realized how difficult this is.	Nan da nan na gano yadda wannan ke da wahala.
They are many.	Suna da yawa.
Only may be the best answer.	Kawai zai iya zama mafi kyawun amsa.
That is why we are here.	Shi ya sa muke nan.
It was scary.	Ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
But it is fast.	Amma yana da sauri.
There is so much to do.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a yi.
You should be fine now, though.	Ya kamata ku kasance lafiya yanzu, ko da yake.
It's home.	Gida ne.
We were totally on top of that.	Mun kasance gaba ɗaya a kan hakan.
I want to help.	Ina son in taimaka.
I'm sure you're just kidding.	Na tabbata kuna wasa ne kawai.
They love others.	Suna son wasu.
He said there was no car before.	Yace babu motar a da.
I never knew.	Ban taba sani ba.
That's what you do.	Shi ne abin da kuke yi.
Slightly.	Dan kadan.
So do some.	Haka wasu suke.
Cold	Sanyi
So it takes some time.	Don haka yana ɗaukar ɗan lokaci.
This is something new for me.	Wannan wani sabon abu ne a gare ni.
This is not true at all.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane gaba daya.
She looked back.	Ta kalli baya.
God forbid.	Allah ya tsaya haka.
I am human and human.	Ni mutum ne kuma mutum ne.
Let's pay for it.	Mu biya shi.
I love them that way.	Ina son su haka.
I do not understand.	ban gane ba.
But he had to speak.	Amma dole ne ya yi magana.
Even one was not afraid of anyone.	Ko daya bai ji tsoron kowa ba.
He may think we will never find out.	Yana iya tunanin ba za mu gano komai ba.
The rest may take some time.	Sauran na iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
, second.	, na biyu.
One is on or off.	Daya yana kan shi ko a kashe shi.
This is definitely not the case.	Wannan ko shakka babu.
They have lived here for years.	Sun yi shekaru suna zaune a nan.
That much can be guaranteed.	Wannan da yawa za ta iya tabbata.
Maybe, after a few years, the road can be found.	Wataƙila, bayan ƴan shekaru, ana iya samun hanya.
We thought it was funny.	Mun dauka tana da ban dariya.
You are alone.	Kai kadai ne.
I called him.	Na kira shi.
It is difficult to get a job.	Yana da wuya a sami aiki.
The car appeared.	Mota ta bayyana.
It comes to an end when you die.	Yana zama ƙarshe idan kun mutu.
Closely!	A hankali!
He is survived by his wife and three children.	Ya bar mata daya da ‘ya’ya uku.
If not you.	Idan ba kai ba.
Unsuccessful, just run.	Ba a ci nasara ba, kawai ya gudu.
It may take until tomorrow.	Yana iya ɗauka har zuwa gobe.
I never did anything.	Ban taba yin komai ba.
We will show you a good time.	Za mu nuna muku lokaci mai kyau.
She never spoke to me.	Bata taba min magana ba.
She sat down again.	Ta sake zama.
Kill with you now.	Kashe tare da ku yanzu.
Maybe even more.	Watakila ya fi haka.
I can do one thing.	Zan iya yin abu ɗaya.
Next, he left.	Na gaba, ya tafi.
There is no such thing.	Babu irin wannan abu.
I went home.	Na wuce gida.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Kamar ana ruwa a ciki.
I can leave now.	Zan iya barin yanzu.
I have to respond to people.	Dole ne in amsa wa mutane.
Something is wrong here I feel.	Wani abu ba daidai ba a nan ina ji.
I can't find it right now.	Ba zan iya samun shi yanzu ba.
Drink a little.	Sha kadan.
He knew right away.	Ya gane haka nan take.
It feels so hot.	Kamar zafi sosai.
It often looks like everything.	Sau da yawa yana kama da komai.
I think I am or.	Ina tsammanin ni ne ko.
That cannot be accepted.	Ba za a iya yarda da hakan ba.
The children are fine.	Yara suna lafiya.
We see you have arrived.	Mun ga kun isa.
They are real things.	Abubuwa ne na gaske.
So she did.	Don haka ta yi hakan.
And he is coming to rise.	Kuma yana zuwa ya tashi.
It was necessary, though.	Ya zama dole, ko da yake.
They do it every year and they love it.	Suna yin shi kowace shekara kuma suna son shi.
And she wanted to do something.	Kuma ta so ta yi wani abu.
I will accept it.	Zan yarda da shi.
I can't give back.	Ba zan iya ba a baya.
Something they see.	Wani abu suke gani.
But that didn't help at all, really.	Amma hakan bai taimaka komai ba, da gaske.
He took the job.	Ya dauki aikin.
Problems occur again.	An sake samun matsala.
It was the funniest thing.	Shi ne abu mafi ban dariya.
Players need to know what happened.	'Yan wasan suna buƙatar sanin abin da ya faru.
But they will be very happy.	Amma za su yi farin ciki sosai.
But very good.	Amma kyau sosai.
You have to feel these things to play with them.	Dole ne ku ji waɗannan abubuwan don wasa da su.
However, we still have a long way to go.	Duk da haka, muna da sauran tafiya.
This will get you off to a good start.	Wannan zai sa ku fara a wuri mai kyau.
You should.	Ya kamata ku yi.
She didn't want to know.	Ba ta so ta sani.
Getting something you think is great.	Samun wani abu da kuke tunani yana da kyau.
There were not many girls at the party.	Babu 'yan mata da yawa a wurin bikin.
But we will never know.	Amma ba za mu taba sani ba.
This must be wrong!	Wannan dole ne kuskure!
Surprisingly.	Abin mamaki.
That will not be easy.	Hakan ba zai yi sauƙi ba.
She could not say anything.	Bata iya cewa komai ba.
So here it is before and after.	Don haka a nan ne kafin da kuma bayan.
It was tomorrow.	Ta kasance gobe.
We help.	Mu taimaka.
He made a great run.	Ya yi babban gudu.
We can accept that.	Za mu iya yarda da hakan.
The view of the water rose.	Kallon ruwa ya tashi.
Now, tell me about happiness.	Yanzu, gaya mani game da farin ciki.
It's kind of hard to explain.	Yana da irin wuya a bayyana.
And it’s one of my favorite things to do.	Kuma yana cikin abubuwan da na fi so.
This is why intelligence works so well.	Wannan shine dalilin da ya sa hankali yana aiki sosai.
I got you	Na samu ku
There is little to say.	Akwai kadan da za a ce.
It made me sad.	Ya sanya ni cikin bakin ciki.
We need you to do that.	Muna buƙatar ku yi hakan.
The first time was missed.	An rasa lokacin farko.
Still we love them so much.	Duk da haka muna son su sosai.
And that's enough.	Kuma wannan ya isa.
They will never be the same.	Ba za su taɓa zama ɗaya ba.
There are some things that are right and wrong.	Akwai wasu abubuwan da suke daidai da kuskure.
You see the front but not the back.	Ka ga gaba amma ba baya ba.
And she wasn’t there.	Kuma ba ta kasance a can ba.
Be honest about how you feel and ask for help.	Yi gaskiya game da yadda kuke ji kuma ku nemi taimako.
He is fine tonight.	Yana lafiya a daren nan.
I'm sure that will work.	Na tabbata hakan zai yi kyau.
I think they did.	Ina tsammanin sun yi.
But still he did not see.	Amma duk da haka bai gani ba.
It certainly rained at night.	Tabbas an yi ruwan sama a cikin dare.
What to leave below.	Abin da a bar kasa.
No one wants to hear the truth, but here it is.	Ba wanda yake son ya ji gaskiya, amma ga shi.
We don't want to see it happen again.	Ba ma son ganin ta sake faruwa.
Everyone fights with each other.	Kowa yayi fada da juna.
First name at last.	Sunan farko a ƙarshe.
We finished our work early today.	Mun gama aikin mu da wuri yau.
I want to make sure they are good no matter what.	Ina so in tabbatar suna da kyau ko da menene.
We are not, like, close.	Ba ma, kamar, kusa.
After that, he should see.	Bayan haka, ya kamata ya gani.
We had so much fun and everyone was so excited.	Mun ji daɗi sosai kuma kowa yana da daɗi sosai.
Even really not written.	Ko da gaske ba a rubuta ba.
Many people were injured by it.	Mutane da yawa sun ji rauni da shi.
He did not want to get involved.	Ba ya so ya shiga ciki.
She knew they were very smart.	Ta san suna da hankali sosai.
It has never been this way.	Bai taba zama haka ba.
To be like.	Don zama kamar.
We describe the process as follows.	Muna bayyana hanyar kamar haka.
He didn't get any more.	Bai samu kara ba.
But everything looked great.	Amma komai ya yi kama sosai.
It's like hot.	Kamar zafi ne.
They also slept during the day.	Sun kuma yi barci a rana.
I never liked you, you know.	Ban taba son ka ba, ka sani.
Use what you think will work best.	Yi amfani da abin da kuke tunanin zai yi aiki mafi kyau.
Come and spend some time with me.	Zo ku ɗan ɗan lokaci tare da ni.
A day later, he died.	Bayan kwana guda, ya mutu.
He did not answer.	Bai amsa ba.
No temporary work was done.	Ba a sake yin wani aiki na ɗan lokaci ba.
He did not know that.	Bai san haka ba.
From near.	Daga kusa.
So we will never know.	Don haka ba za mu taba sani ba.
It's up to you.	Yana kan ku.
I don't even know what name to call it.	Ban ma san sunan da zan kira shi ba.
Or a hand? 	Ko hannu?
In the case of children, what happens to them.	Game da yara, abin da ke faruwa da su.
no.	a'a.
The water rose quickly.	Ruwa ya tashi da sauri.
But I was scared.	Amma ina da ban tsoro.
He is not one of us.	Ba daya daga cikin mu ba ne.
I did not recognize him from the front.	Ban gane shi daga gaba ba.
It has to be it.	Dole ne ya zama shi.
The time has come for all of us.	Lokaci ya zo gare mu duka.
So, it was removed.	Don haka, an cire shi.
Everyone one.	Kowa daya.
This is a nice house.	Wannan gida ne mai kyau.
You have to pay for this.	Dole ne ku biya wannan.
He knew what he could do.	Ya san abin da zai iya yi.
It was late at night.	Sai dare yayi.
He was intelligent, and intelligent.	Ya kasance mai hankali, kuma mai hankali.
And yes, it is for women.	Kuma a, yana da mata.
He could not be happier.	Ba zai iya zama mai farin ciki ba.
What he sees now is himself.	Abin da yake gani yanzu shi ne kansa.
I have a lot of pain.	Ina jin zafi sosai.
But first, it’s time to laugh at the first year celebration.	Amma na farko, lokacin yin dariya a cikin bikin shekara ta ɗaya.
Immediately I wanted to stay there.	Nan take na so in zauna a can.
He never did anything.	Bai taba komai ba.
We take care of the rest.	Muna kula da sauran.
Many things have happened.	Abubuwa da yawa sun faru.
I have a good job.	Ina da aiki mai kyau.
He volunteered.	Ya yi aikin sa kai.
He never did that to me.	Bai taba yi min haka ba.
It is a pleasure to know you.	Abin farin ciki ne don sanin sanin ku.
No, no, no.	A'a, a'a, a'a.
I can't get there until tonight.	Ba zan iya zuwa can ba sai yau da dare.
But that requires something.	Amma wannan yana buƙatar wani abu.
They say something.	Suna cewa wani abu.
That would show her.	Hakan zai nuna mata.
It's a pity.	Abin bakin ciki ne.
He still does.	Har yanzu ya yi.
They will tell you that, if you ask them.	Za su gaya maka haka, idan ka tambaye su.
Actually I couldn’t get enough.	A gaskiya ba zan iya isa ba.
It can’t be bothered right now.	Ba za a iya damu da shi yanzu ba.
That's right.	Haka yake.
Fly from here to there.	Tashi daga nan zuwa can.
I was so scared, I really was.	Na ji tsoro sosai, da gaske nake.
Then ask him.	Sai ka tambaye shi.
I can't believe this.	Ba zan iya yarda da wannan ba.
I think more than anyone in the house.	Ina tunanin fiye da kowa a gidan.
Good talk, though.	Magana mai kyau, ko da yake.
For a while.	Na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
However, there is an exception to this.	Duk da haka, akwai ban da wannan.
I think he appears there now.	Ina tsammanin ya bayyana a can yanzu.
They are in his head.	Suna cikin kansa.
She started laughing.	Ta fara dariya.
What we give you, we can take lightly.	Abin da muka ba ku, za mu iya ɗauka cikin sauƙi.
She often seemed to be obsessed with discomfort.	Sau da yawa ta yi kamar ta damu da rashin jin daɗi.
They do not have to look good if they eat well.	Ba lallai ba ne su yi kyau idan sun ci sosai.
It is something about how they are together.	Wani abu ne game da yadda suke tare.
Maybe it's selfish.	Wataƙila son kai ne.
I was really happy they were together.	Na yi farin ciki da gaske suna farin ciki tare.
Someone can take it.	Wani zai iya ɗauka.
She passed.	Ta wuce.
He did it more than anyone else.	Ya yi shi fiye da kowa.
It should be turned off.	Ya kamata a kashe.
There is no better time than now.	Babu wani lokaci mafi kyau fiye da yanzu.
He doesn't need you anymore.	Ba ya bukatar ku kuma.
They said.	Suka ce.
We know what we're talking about, let's help you !.	Mun san abin da muke magana, bari mu taimake ku!.
Two years.	Shekaru biyu.
I kept walking, though.	Na ci gaba da tafiya, ko da yake.
They are dead and not lost.	Sun mutu kuma ba a rasa su ba.
I don't think we will bring this up yet.	Bana jin za mu fito da wannan har yanzu.
And next, and next.	Kuma na gaba, da na gaba.
He cried a little, you know you stopped.	Ya dan yi kuka, ka san ka daina.
Very few people got it.	Mutane kaɗan ne suka samu.
We are not close.	Ba mu kusa ba.
He lives next to me.	Yana zaune kusa da ni.
It has fat.	Tana da mai.
That's it, you're done.	Shi ke nan, kun gama.
I'm not worried now.	Ban damu ba yanzu.
She was funny and always nice to laugh at.	Ta kasance mai ban sha'awa kuma koyaushe tana da kyau don dariya.
And then,	Sai me,
When no one accepted her, she left home.	Lokacin da babu wanda ya yarda da ita, sai ta tashi daga gida.
I did three.	Na yi uku.
They work fine.	Suna aiki lafiya.
It appears enough reason.	Ya bayyana isa dalilin.
And he won again.	Kuma ya sake samun nasara.
We must do things right.	Dole ne mu yi abubuwa daidai.
They proved that they could.	Sun tabbatar da cewa za su iya.
Hearing!	Ji!
You fight with someone, you refuse.	Kuna fada da wani mutum, kun ƙi.
Everything was nice and simple too.	Duk ya yi kyau kuma mai sauƙi kuma.
We are not police here.	Mu ba 'yan sanda ba ne a nan.
Let her worry about what she can do next.	Bari ta damu da abin da zai iya yi a gaba.
It can make you do things you thought you would never do.	Yana iya sa ku yin abubuwan da kuke tunanin ba za ku taɓa yi ba.
The same is true now.	Haka ya kasance a yanzu.
That will not be easy.	Hakan ba zai kasance mai sauƙi ba.
I do it anyway.	Ina yin shi duk da haka.
He has never and will never.	Ba ya da kuma ba zai taba.
But the problem persists.	Amma matsalar ta ci gaba.
Work to do.	Aiki don yi.
They are successful.	Suna samun nasara.
This is not the case at all.	Wannan ba ko kaɗan ba ne.
More than that should not be said.	Fiye da haka bai kamata a ce ba.
That has happened in the past.	Hakan ya faru a baya.
They love each other very much.	Suna son juna sosai.
He would not tell me.	Ba zai gaya mani ba.
He used this phrase hardly.	Ya yi amfani da wannan magana da wuya.
We'd better go.	Gara mu tafi.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu wani abu da ya wuce haka.
I thought more of her.	Na fi tunanin ta.
He did not speak for a long time.	Ya dade bai yi magana ba.
I'm saying you touched them.	Ina cewa ka taba su.
There is something very living about it.	Akwai wani abu mai rai sosai game da ita.
We have to run.	Dole ne mu gudu.
But when he started, he became a man again.	Amma da ya fara, ya zama mutum kuma.
Maybe he bought us a drink, though.	Wataƙila ya saya mana abin sha, ko da yake.
I am one of them.	Ina cikin su.
This is not a problem.	Wannan ba matsala.
Please don't let me kill you.	Don Allah kar ka sa na kashe ka.
It comes from nearby.	Ya zo daga kusa da nan.
I thought that eventually something would be done about it.	Na yi tunanin cewa a ƙarshe za a yi wani abu game da shi.
I knew the boy was going to be a kid.	Na san yaro zai zama yaro.
I wish.	Ina fata.
They will not kill him.	Ba za su kashe shi ba.
Take it easy on yourself.	Yi sauƙi a kan kanku.
Now it looks like any other home.	Yanzu yana kama da kowane gida.
This project is not very interesting.	Wannan aikin ba shi da sha'awa sosai.
There was a whole day there.	Akwai rana duka a wurin.
It does not pay for itself.	Ba biya shi kansa.
And we both know why.	Kuma mu biyu mun san dalilin.
No one even thought.	Ba wanda ya ma yi tunani.
He played two games against each other.	Ya buga wasan biyu da juna.
They do not need much.	Ba su buƙatar wani abu da yawa.
I used to love what you have.	Na kasance ina son abin da kuke da shi.
I think this is exactly the new name of your new.	Ina tsammanin wannan shine daidai sabon suna na sabon ku.
Leave her safe.	A bar ta lafiya.
I could not understand it very well.	Ba zan iya gane shi sosai ba.
However it is recommended to do so.	Duk da haka ana ba da shawarar yin hakan.
Useful stuff.	Abubuwa masu amfani.
Women can see.	Mata suna iya gani.
Which leads me to the next thing.	Wanda ke kai ni zuwa abu na gaba.
We have to see how things work of course.	Dole ne mu ga yadda abubuwa ke aiki ba shakka.
There is nothing that you can do to change.	Babu wani abu da za ku yi don canza.
It worked for me.	Ya yi min aiki.
I have no interest in them.	Ba ni da sha'awar su.
It is the same with you.	Shi ma haka yake.
Maybe we can remove this in the future.	Wataƙila za mu iya cire wannan a nan gaba.
He keeps walking.	Yana ci gaba da tafiya.
Only now.	Kawai a yanzu.
But the man did not seem to care.	Amma mutumin kamar bai damu ba.
This really bothered me.	Wannan ya damu da ni sosai.
No police are coming.	Babu 'yan sanda da ke zuwa.
It doesn't matter to you.	Ba komai a gare ku.
Gradually she moved upward.	A hankali ta koma sama.
It should be an exciting time.	Ya kamata ya zama lokaci mai ban sha'awa.
She felt that way at the time.	Ta ji haka a lokacin.
I told her so.	Na gaya mata haka.
I will get a car, meet you next time.	Zan samu mota, hadu da ku a gaba.
Water is next.	Ruwa shine gaba.
I do not need you.	Ba ni da bukatar ku.
Let us help you.	Mu taimake ku.
We had time then.	Muna da lokaci a lokacin.
How long have they been gone.	Har yaushe suka tafi.
He never failed.	Bai taba yin kasa ba.
Write to you from there.	Rubuta muku daga can.
I know he never thought of kids so much in the past.	Na san bai taba tunanin yara sosai a baya ba.
It is now clear that the problem is over.	Ya bayyana a yanzu cewa matsalar ta wuce lafiya.
Like, really nice people.	Kamar, mutane masu kyau sosai.
I was rejected.	An ƙi ni.
It goes into your head.	Yana shiga cikin kai.
How much do you want to do later in life.	Nawa kuke son yin haka daga baya a rayuwa.
Everyone loves kids.	Kowa yana son yara.
The only one who makes them money.	Kawai wanda ke sa su kuɗi.
Only a child.	Yaro ne kawai.
We are here, and they need us.	Muna nan, kuma suna bukatar mu.
It's all about life.	Duk game da rayuwa ne.
There is no way.	Babu wata hanya.
Tomorrow can be very sick.	Gobe ​​yana iya yin rashin lafiya sosai.
I hope you like everything I like.	Ina fatan kuna son duk abin da nake so.
And even more so.	Kuma ya fi haka.
It's just a place to sleep.	Wurin kwana ne kawai.
I could not make these decisions on my own.	Ba zan iya yanke waɗannan shawarar da kaina ba.
Yet it must be the best.	Amma duk da haka dole ne ya zama mafi kyau.
Without the back.	Ba tare da baya ba.
Something better could be at work.	Wani abu mafi kyau zai iya zama a wurin aiki.
So that never happened.	Don haka abin bai taba faruwa ba.
One does not leave.	Mutum baya barin.
I sat on my own.	Na zauna a cikin kaina.
I looked at her.	Na duba ta.
Although much needs to be done, it has begun.	Ko da yake akwai bukatar a yi da yawa, an fara.
Just another year.	Kawai wata shekara.
And in this way too.	Kuma ta wannan hanya ma.
Start fighting.	Fara fada.
She seemed empty, she didn't save anything.	Ta yi kamar ba komai, ba ta ajiye komai ba.
Of course the police came and took him away.	Tabbas 'yan sanda sun zo suka tafi da shi.
Can't wait to have time to read it.	Ba za a iya jira don samun lokacin karanta shi ba.
I found it easy to leave.	Na sami sauƙi in tafi.
This request is not valid.	Wannan buƙatar ba ta da kyau.
So, she decided not to go.	Don haka, ta yanke shawarar ba za ta tafi ba.
I live for food.	Ina rayuwa ne don abinci.
We can do nothing but wait.	Ba za mu iya yin komai ba sai jira.
You appear from no.	Kun bayyana daga babu.
It's funny now.	Yana da ban dariya yanzu.
It goes right.	Yana tafiya daidai.
No, it is not.	A'a, ba haka ba ne.
The price was good, though.	Kuɗin ya yi kyau, ko da yake.
This, however, does not give an answer anyway.	Wannan, duk da haka, ba ya ba da amsa ko ta yaya.
Of course we did not.	Tabbas ba mu yi ba.
The next thing.	Abu mai zuwa.
She was talking and talking.	Tana magana tana magana.
You may enjoy this.	Kuna iya jin daɗin wannan.
Not one.	Ba ko daya ba.
That's why she ran.	Shi yasa ta gudu.
She fills it open.	Ta cika ta bude.
The problem is that this name is totally useless to me.	Matsalar ita ce wannan sunan gaba ɗaya ba shi da amfani a gare ni.
He gave me hope.	Ya ba ni fata.
This must explain why this happened.	Wannan dole ne ya bayyana dalilin da ya sa hakan ya faru.
You have it at home and turn it on at work.	Kuna da shi a gida kuma kunna shi a wurin aiki.
There is no reason for you to close.	Babu dalilin da zai sa ka rufe.
It's not money at the moment.	Ba kudi bane a wannan lokacin.
Which is a lot.	Wanda yake da yawa.
Take a moment to think about the answer.	Ɗauki ɗan lokaci don tunanin amsa.
The children waited.	Yara sun jira.
He is a beautiful boy.	Wani kyakkyawan yaro ne.
They pretend to be talking to each other.	Suna yin kamar suna magana da juna.
But that someone would not be me.	Amma cewa wani ba zai zama ni ba.
Just knowing this is not enough.	Kawai sanin wannan bai isa ba.
The doorbell rang.	Ana ci gaba da buga k'ofar gida.
The back of the house was cold.	A bayan gidan yayi sanyi.
I'm done now.	Na gama yanzu.
The story begins very well.	Labarin ya fara da kyau sosai.
Not necessarily, you know.	Ba lallai ba ne, ka sani.
I have learned a lot from you.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa daga gare ku.
Anyone can join.	Kowa zai iya shiga.
Let me get back to you on that.	Bari in dawo gare ku akan hakan.
I think of the man, and how he died.	Ina tunanin mutumin, da yadda ya mutu.
Many died.	Mutane da yawa sun mutu.
They are not mine.	Ba nawa bane.
She apologized.	Ta bashi hakuri.
The money is here.	Kudi yana nan.
Kids love this game.	Yara suna son wannan wasan.
Never look up.	Kar a taba kallon sama.
She is injured.	Ta ji rauni.
It's fast.	Yana da sauri.
Since then, however, he has lived in it.	Tun daga nan, duk da haka, ya zauna a ciki.
You are against me.	Kuna gaba da ni.
Sometimes, people do not want to hear them.	Wani lokaci, mutane ba sa son jin su.
There is help.	Akwai taimako.
Then they re-enter.	Daga nan sai su sake shiga.
It is the only way to the end.	Hanya ce kawai zuwa ga ƙarshe.
Although they are not said to be very good.	Ko da yake ba a ce za su yi kyau sosai ba.
I love you all.	Ina son ku da duka.
But that she did not know if anyone had gone with her.	Amma cewa ba ta san ko wani ya tafi tare da shi ba.
This is very good.	Wannan yayi kyau sosai.
You know for sure.	Kun san da gaske.
I can't think of anything.	Ba zan iya tunanin abin ba.
On their work.	Akan aikin su.
The truth is being looked at.	Ana duba gaskiya.
And we thought that was wrong.	Kuma mun yi tunanin hakan ba daidai ba ne.
Go, girls.	Ku tafi, 'yan mata.
It's too much for me.	Ya dan yi mini yawa.
They should be doing the same thing.	Ainihin ya kamata su kasance suna yin abu ɗaya ne.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
He played the game correctly.	Ya buga wasan daidai.
She wanted it.	Ta so shi.
Very hot, very hot last week.	Zafi sosai, ranar ƙarshe ta mako mai zafi sosai.
Go ahead, it doesn't work that way.	Ci gaba, ba haka yake aiki ba.
She took it.	Ta dauka.
Then she knew.	Sai ta sani.
She told him the truth.	Ta fada masa gaskiya.
She did not leave the house.	Bata bar gidan ba.
I did not pass it.	Ban wuce shi ba.
It will kill you a lot if you do.	Zai kashe ku da yawa idan kun yi.
So watch how you talk to yourself.	Don haka kalli yadda kuke magana da kanku.
We think he got up again.	Muna ganin ya sake tashi.
However, it is done.	Duk da haka, an yi.
Travel helps me prepare for work.	Tafiya yana taimaka mini in shirya yin aiki.
I prefer to travel by bus.	Na fi son tafiya da bas.
This never happened.	Wannan bai taba faruwa ba.
Everyone got involved completely.	Kowa ya shiga ciki gaba daya.
At that time people must be taken inside.	A wannan lokacin dole ne a dauki mutane a ciki.
Others were not.	Wasu kuma ba su kasance ba.
And no one wants that.	Kuma babu wanda yake son hakan.
There are other things beyond that.	Akwai wasu abubuwan da suka wuce haka.
But one day, something will happen again.	Amma wata rana, wani abu zai sake gano shi.
She lives nearby.	Tana zaune kusa.
I feel a little sick.	Ina jin rashin lafiya kadan.
So, she was right.	Don haka, ta yi gaskiya.
I have never had this problem and it is amazing to me.	Ban taɓa samun wannan matsalar ba kuma yana da ban mamaki a gare ni.
We can look at something positive.	Za mu iya kallon wani abu mai kyau.
He made a mistake, though.	Ya yi kuskure, ko da yake.
And it's not good.	Kuma ba ta da kyau.
Just really hard.	Kawai gaske wuya.
I was just called.	An kira ni kawai.
But now he too is gone.	Amma yanzu shi ma ya tafi.
How nice to be here.	Yaya yayi kyau ka kasance a nan.
But for us, today they are hard to find.	Amma saboda mu, a yau suna da wuya a samu.
I will play the game.	Zan buga wasan.
I would not suggest that you can do that.	Ba zan ba da shawarar cewa za ku iya yin hakan ba.
She said.	Ta fad'a.
You rarely have these together.	Da wuya kuna da waɗannan tare.
I don’t feel her out much.	Bana jin ta fita da yawa.
You can do the rest for yourself.	Kuna iya yin sauran don kanku.
This is true productivity.	Wannan gaskiya ne yawan aiki.
I need to talk to you.	Ina bukata in yi magana da ku.
I have never heard of him.	Ban taba jin irin sa ba.
What's this? 	Menene wannan?
But in this game you have everything to gain.	Amma a cikin wannan wasan kuna da duk abin da za ku samu.
I know you better than that.	Na fi wannan sanin ku.
You will not know.	Ba za ku sani ba.
I want to do it again.	Ina so in sake yin hakan.
Now if you are going to come this way.	Yanzu idan za ku zo ta wannan hanyar.
I'm sure you can.	Na tabbata za ku iya.
I read it all.	Na karanta duka.
He does not need to.	Ba ya bukata.
It's too cold now.	Yayi sanyi sosai yanzu.
We should buy more food.	Ya kamata mu sayi ƙarin abinci.
It's just a sign.	Alama ce kawai.
But about that.	Amma game da wannan.
I think he is dead.	Ina ta ganin ya mutu.
You will talk to her again about her identity.	Za ku sake magana da ainihin ta.
He went.	Ya tafi.
You are playing to win.	Kuna wasa don cin nasara.
It's just a place of happiness.	Wuri ne kawai na farin ciki.
I don't care what others think of me.	Ban damu da abin da wasu suke tunani game da ni ba.
I just use it to run.	Ina amfani da shi kawai don gudu.
I will not let it happen.	Ba zan bari ya faru ba.
if for another.	idan ga wani.
No one will touch it now, anyway.	Babu wanda zai taba shi a yanzu, ko ta yaya.
And outside of it.	Kuma a waje da shi.
It feels good.	Ya ji dadi.
I have no doubt about it now.	Ba ni da wata shakka game da shi yanzu.
Reflect.	Yi tunani.
He did so, reminding himself.	Ya yi haka, yana tuna wa kansa.
He suggested we stop drinking coffee.	Ya ba da shawarar mu tsaya shan kofi.
I love it if you can do this every day.	Ina son shi idan za ku iya yin wannan kowace rana.
You can talk to almost anyone.	Kuna iya magana da kusan kowa.
Not everyone has these things.	Ba kowa ke da waɗannan abubuwan ba.
It doesn't really help.	Ba ya taimaka sosai.
And eventually he will kill you.	Kuma a ƙarshe zai kashe ku.
I think we need more of that.	Ina tsammanin muna buƙatar ƙarin hakan.
In the last three years.	A cikin shekaru uku da suka gabata.
He did nothing to her.	Bai yi mata komai ba.
I have to ask you something.	Dole ne in tambaye ku wani abu.
Help me figure out where the problem is.	Taimaka min gano inda matsalar take.
Use it.	Yi amfani da shi.
Now is the time of truth.	Yanzu shine lokacin gaskiya.
Watching them makes you happy.	Kallon su yayi abin farin ciki ne.
We read it all.	Mun karanta duka.
It can be true easily.	Zai iya zama gaskiya cikin sauƙi.
Something else is happening here.	Wani abu kuma yana faruwa a nan.
I'm not even sure she likes it.	Ban ma tabbata tana son shi ba.
Here it is again.	Ga shi kuma.
That is just.	Abin da yake kawai.
Get help.	Ku nemi taimako.
They live in us.	Suna zaune a cikin mu.
I played it and I love it.	Na yi wasa da shi kuma ina son shi.
These are not shown.	Ba a nuna waɗannan ba.
They were completely devoured.	An ci su gaba daya.
One day we will pay for this.	Wata rana za mu biya wannan.
Maybe a week late.	Wataƙila a makara mako guda.
Take your time.	Dauki lokacin ku.
But we should not protect them from anything.	Amma bai kamata mu kare su daga kowane abu ba.
That would do me a favor.	Hakan zai yi min.
Hard for him.	Da wuya a gare shi.
They know me.	Sun san ni.
Nothing is known about him.	Ba a san komai game da shi ba.
Or it could be someone else.	Ko kuma yana iya zama wani gaba ɗaya.
All the other players didn’t care.	Duk sauran 'yan wasan ba su damu ba.
But it was difficult.	Amma ya yi wuya.
He went the other way.	Ya tafi wata hanya.
If something is not known, they do not know.	Idan wani abu ba a sani ba, ba su sani ba.
I will not lie about that.	Ba zan yi karya game da hakan ba.
It's coming slowly.	Yana zuwa a hankali.
He knows her well.	Ya san ta sosai.
They were like two schoolgirls.	Sun kasance kamar 'yan makaranta biyu.
She has been running for a long time.	Ta dade tana gudu.
The finished product is very good.	Kayan da aka gama yana da kyau sosai.
I remember he touched me that way.	Na tuna ya taba ni haka.
I'm just talking they understand.	Ina magana kawai sun gane.
We are not enough.	Ba mu isa ba.
There is also food.	Akwai kuma abincin.
There is nothing there.	Babu wani abu a wurin.
It just didn’t add up, anyway.	Kamar ba ta kara ba, ko ta yaya.
I go to work every day.	Ina zuwa aiki kowace rana.
Now about dinner.	Yanzu game da abincin dare.
There is absolutely nothing she can do.	Lallai babu wani abu da zata iya yi.
I thought we were going to use your car.	Na yi tunanin za mu yi amfani da motar ku.
No, no, no, no.	Ba, ba, ba, ba.
That is not happening now.	Hakan ba ya faruwa a yanzu.
He could have another !.	Zai iya samun wani!.
It will grow out of it.	Zai girma daga gare ta.
He just knew.	Ya sani kawai.
Try as she can, she can't sleep.	Gwada yadda ta iya, ta kasa yin barci.
It happens.	Yana faruwa.
We were really up.	Mun kasance da gaske sama.
Get in the car.	Ku a cikin mota.
You will get sick.	Za ku yi rashin lafiya.
She's right, you know.	Ta yi gaskiya, ka sani.
I feel like they love me.	Ina jin kamar suna so na.
Maybe it's too late.	Wataƙila ya makara.
And that led to another program.	Kuma hakan ya kai ga wani shirin shirin.
I could not ask him anything.	Na kasa tambaye shi komai.
We fixed all this.	Mun gyara duk wannan.
Work properly.	Yi aiki yadda ya kamata.
Some of us.	Wasu daga cikin mu.
Make sure you arrive early to get a good seat.	Tabbatar ku zo da wuri don samun wurin zama mai kyau.
That is what one will do.	Haka mutum zai yi.
I feel fine with him.	Na ji lafiya tare da shi.
To respond in our request.	Don amsa a cikin bukatar mu.
When we saw that we assumed it was something.	Da muka ga haka sai muka dauka yana da wani abu.
So we brought it back with us.	Don haka mun dawo da shi tare da mu.
You can not sleep the night before the event.	Ba za ku iya barci dare kafin taron ba.
I am in the right place.	Ina wurin da ya dace.
There is something great about all of this.	Akwai wani babban abu game da wannan duka.
I know something about it, but it is not enough.	Na san wani abu game da shi, amma bai isa ba.
But it is.	Amma shi ne.
He left in the morning.	Sai da safe ya fita.
I am.	Ni ma.
He had nothing until the meeting.	Ba shi da komai har zuwa taron.
This is where the work lies.	A nan ne aikin yake.
She felt cut off.	Ta ji an yanke.
I see no reason why you can not.	Ban ga dalilin da zai sa ba za ku iya ba.
If so.	Idan kuma.
Remove them from the heat and enjoy!	Cire su daga zafi kuma ku ji daɗi!.
She is upset because she does not know what to do.	Bata da dad'i don bata san me zata yi ba.
I have done well so far.	Na yi kyau ya zuwa yanzu.
No one is known.	Ba a san kowa ba.
Of course it can come.	Tabbas zai iya zuwa.
You did not pay for that.	Ba ku biya hakan ba.
But that is not the case anymore.	Amma ba haka yake ba kuma.
I hope you understand.	Ina fatan kun gane.
She told me to sit down.	Ta ce in zauna.
That you can use.	Da za ku iya amfani.
Who will do it first?	Wa zai fara yi?.
God willing.	Allah yasa.
She walks like a man.	Tafiya take kamar mutum.
You do not hear.	Ba ku ji.
Can we request more than one?	Za mu iya neman ƙarin yawa daga guda ɗaya?.
She is dead.	Ta mutu.
It can do almost anything.	Yana iya yin komai sosai.
Everyone wants to be with you.	Duk suna so su kasance a wurin ku.
Or did he not.	Ko bai yi ba.
I don't even care how it happened.	Ban ma damu da yadda abin ya faru ba.
You must pass each to advance.	Dole ne ku wuce kowane don ci gaba.
This is a great time.	Wannan shi ne babban lokaci.
They are not even close by.	Ba su ma kusa kusa ba.
People are talking about them.	Mutane suna magana game da su.
Many people do this, not just one.	Mutane da yawa ne suke yin wannan, ba ɗaya kaɗai ba.
I was not real to him.	Ban kasance masa da gaske ba.
Certainly not one on one.	Tabbas ba daya akan daya ba.
You look at me.	Kun duba ni.
No more.	Ba babu kuma.
And that will only make her worse.	Kuma hakan zai kara mata zafi.
The second time it works fine.	Lokaci na biyu yana aiki lafiya.
They expect to fight, but not yet.	Suna tsammanin fada, amma ba tukuna.
They are so beautiful.	Suna da kyau sosai.
They immediately stopped.	Nan da nan suka tsaya.
One person has a problem, another does not.	Mutum daya yana da matsala, wani ba ya.
That was amazing.	Hakan ya kasance na ban mamaki.
That makes it even better.	Hakan ya sa ya fi kyau.
And this is it.	Kuma wannan shi ne.
Sometimes it does not.	Wani lokaci ba ya yi.
I will sleep on the floor in your room.	Zan kwana a kasa a dakin ku.
I do not know what you are talking about!	Ban san me kuke magana ba!
She never did much work.	Ba ta taɓa yin aiki da yawa ba.
The diner is filled with heat.	Mai cin abinci ya cika da zafi.
And maybe you died here or maybe you didn’t.	Kuma watakila ka mutu a nan ko watakila ba ka yi ba.
I have never seen anything come out of that.	Ban taba ganin wani abu ya fito daga cikin haka ba.
Little will tell me.	Kadan zai gaya mani.
I will come tonight.	Zan zo a daren nan.
That could not be real.	Cewa ba zai iya zama da gaske ba.
No words.	Babu wata magana.
I do not need anyone.	Bana bukatar kowa.
However, he made a mistake.	Duk da haka, ya yi kuskure.
I can get in here.	Zan iya shiga nan.
But one day it started.	Amma wata rana ya fara.
When people do what they want, you can say.	Lokacin da mutane ke yin abin da suke so, za ku iya fada.
Many said they had seen it.	Mutane da yawa sun ce sun gani.
I am a local.	Ni ɗan gida ne.
Everything to be paid.	Duk abin da za a biya.
Living things are suitable for many fish.	Masu rai sun dace da kifi da yawa.
Don't go there.	Kar ku je can.
Think about it.	Ka yi tunani a kan hakan.
I'm sure it will be.	Na tabbata za a yi.
Drink plenty of water.	Sha ruwa mai yawa.
Maybe they were right.	Wataƙila sun yi gaskiya.
It has two things.	Yana da abubuwa biyu.
You try them immediately and there.	Kuna gwada su nan da nan kuma a can.
Either way.	Ta kowace hanya.
Otherwise, it is time to get a new movie.	In ba haka ba, lokaci ya yi da za a sami sabon fim.
Like it or not.	Ka so ta ko ka ƙi ta.
The car is gone.	Motar ta tafi.
Get to know each other.	Ku san juna.
But you will.	Amma za ku.
And at the moment she is not sure.	Kuma a wannan lokacin ba ta da tabbas.
I will fix the problem happily.	Zan gyara matsalar da farin ciki.
Is that the problem.	Shin wannan shine matsalar.
And this is a regular occurrence.	Kuma wannan abu ne na yau da kullum.
I got here.	Na samu a nan.
It's hot there.	Yana da zafi a can.
He has to add something to what he sees.	Dole ne ya ƙara wani abu ga abin da yake gani.
He was surprised to hear the news.	Yayi mamakin jin labarin.
He is a good man.	Mutum ne mai kyau.
You have been honest with me.	Kun kasance masu gaskiya da ni.
No, no, no.	A'a, babu, babu.
There is still much more to do.	Har yanzu da sauran abubuwa da yawa a yi.
I even called him to see if he would take it.	Har na kira shi ko zai dauka.
Otherwise, we have to work now.	Ban da haka, dole ne mu yi aiki a yanzu.
That will not stop.	Wannan ba zai tsaya ba.
You need to explain it.	Kuna buƙatar bayyana shi.
You would have died easily.	Da kun mutu cikin sauƙi.
I love it like the others.	Ina son shi kamar sauran su.
This is similar to the other problem.	Wannan yana kama da sauran matsala.
Take nothing.	Take ba komai.
Do you have children.	Kuna da yara.
One day the work we do will pay off.	Wata rana aikin da muke yi zai biya.
She adjusted her seat without delay.	Ta gyara zama ba tare da bata lokaci ba.
Tell people what is happening.	Faɗa wa mutane abin da ke faruwa.
I am still on my way.	Har yanzu ina kan tafiya.
Although he did not care.	Ko da yake bai damu ba.
They are often told to do.	Sau da yawa an ce su yi.
The rest no one used it.	Sauran babu wanda ya yi amfani da shi.
She refused to help him.	Ba ta yarda ta taimake shi ba.
The man touched him a third time.	Mutumin ya taba shi a karo na uku.
You have to help.	Dole ne ku taimaka.
I, too, at the time.	Ni ma, a lokacin.
To all of us.	Zuwa gare mu duka.
So he decided to get up.	Don haka ya yanke shawarar ya tashi.
That is very good.	Hakan yana da kyau sosai.
He has since remarried.	Tun daga nan ya sake yin aure.
Which is good.	Wanda yayi kyau.
Kind of no longer enjoys playing.	Irin ya daina jin daɗin yin wasa.
There will always be.	Za a kasance koyaushe.
If it makes you feel good, it’s great.	Idan ya sa ku ji daɗi, yana da kyau.
Someone upset him.	Wani ya bata masa rai.
Or so we thought.	Ko haka muka yi tunani.
Or just surprise.	Ko kuma kawai mamaki.
He walked fast.	Yayi tafiya da sauri.
How much is hard to say.	Nawa ne da wuya a ce.
I can say that he is not interested.	Zan iya cewa ba ya sha'awar.
Give me one chance to make the day come quickly.	Ka ba ni dama guda ɗaya don sa ranar ta zo da sauri.
I did it.	Na yi shi.
What it should be.	Abin da ya kamata ya kasance.
She comes in and opens the door.	Tana zuwa ta bude kofar.
No problem.	Babu wata matsala.
Everything happened.	Komai ya faru.
But they are there.	Amma suna can.
And to allow us to spend more time together.	Kuma don ba mu damar samun ƙarin lokaci tare.
Some have, some do not.	Wasu suna da, wasu ba su da.
You need to tell me what’s going on here.	Kuna buƙatar gaya mani abin da ke faruwa a nan.
I just started.	Na fara kawai.
Make sure everyone gets the right time.	Tabbatar cewa kowane mutum ya sami daidai lokacin.
He didn’t even care much.	Har ma da yawa bai damu ba.
Maybe it should.	Wataƙila ta kamata.
This is good for them.	Wannan yana da kyau a gare su.
All of these things can be true at the same time.	Duk waɗannan abubuwa na iya zama gaskiya a lokaci guda.
He seemed afraid to touch me.	Kamar yana tsoron taba ni.
I didn't even know you were here.	Ban ma san kana nan ba.
It has been difficult here.	Ya kasance da wuya a nan.
And the house is closed.	Kuma gidan a rufe.
The book is amazing.	Littafin yana da ban mamaki.
And well so too.	Kuma da kyau haka ma.
This is accepted.	An yarda da wannan.
I'm looking for something like this.	Ina neman wani abu kamar wannan.
No one will ever do that in real life.	Babu wanda zai taɓa yin haka a rayuwa ta gaske.
Everything has already worked out right.	Duk abin da ya riga ya yi aiki daidai.
To be taken away.	Da za a tafi da shi.
It felt a little strange to me at first.	Ya dan ji a hankali a gare ni da farko.
It's just enough.	Ya isa kawai.
This is great.	Wannan yayi kyau.
If so, the truth will come back, and the work is complete.	Idan haka ne, gaskiya za ta dawo, kuma aikin ya cika.
Please stop calling!	Da fatan za a daina kira!
She could not imagine anyone wanting that.	Ba ta iya tunanin wani yana son hakan.
I'll tell you what went.	Zan gaya muku abin da ya tafi.
We sure did.	Mun tabbata mun yi.
He knew exactly what had happened.	Ya san ainihin abin da ya faru.
This, and other things that brought me here.	Wannan, da sauran abubuwan da ta kawo ni.
Things.	Abubuwan.
I don't have to come here.	Bai kamata in zo nan ba.
It works, it works.	Yana aiki, aiki ne.
Not at all.	Ba a kowane lokaci ba.
The greatest is not always the best.	Mafi girma ba koyaushe shine mafi kyau ba.
I do not see there.	Ba na ganin akwai.
Everyone wants to play.	Kowa yana son yin wasa.
They didn't say anything to me.	Ba su ce da ni komai ba.
Do you have to go?	Dole ne ku tafi?
It didn't look like much.	Bai yi kama da yawa ba.
Absolutely there is.	Babu shakka akwai.
Drink water.	Sha ruwan.
If he were.	Idan ya kasance.
Or he failed to say that.	Ko ya kasa cewa.
And it will.	Kuma zai yi.
In fact the man was sitting in the car.	A gaskiya mutumin yana zaune ne a cikin mota.
She raises her hand up.	Ta daga hannu sama sama.
Be at three o'clock that day.	Ku kasance da karfe uku na wannan rana.
Like he touched a lot of people.	Kamar ya taba mutane da yawa.
We have to do something.	Dole ne mu yi wani abu.
Today, everyone does everything.	A yau, kowa yana yin komai.
He could not explain it but he did.	Ya kasa bayyana shi amma ya yi.
But marriage is a big thing.	Amma aure babban abu ne.
So they went home.	Sai suka koma gida.
There are others.	Akwai kuma wasu.
She was just a kind of person.	Ta kasance wani irin mutum ne kawai.
This is a little closer to home.	Wannan yana ɗan kusa da gida.
Age.	Shekaru.
We are scared, of course.	Muna tsoro, ba shakka.
But you have to talk sometimes.	Amma sai ka yi magana wani lokaci .
This will take time and work.	Wannan zai ɗauki lokaci da aiki.
Nothing will change.	Babu abin da zai canza.
It is often true.	Sau da yawa yana da gaskiya.
The basement is very cold.	Gidan kasa yayi sanyi sosai.
It is difficult for anyone to speak.	Da wuya wani ya sami damar yin magana.
It feels good.	Yana jin dadi.
They are not lost.	Ba a rasa su ba.
I see them.	Ina ganin su.
I found myself excited to have it there.	Na sami kaina cikin farin ciki da samun shi a can.
It reminds me of home.	Yana tuna min gida.
I can't figure out why it doesn't work.	Ba zan iya gano dalilin da yasa ba ya aiki.
But of course there is not much life there.	Amma ba shakka babu rayuwa mai yawa a can.
I am always in trouble.	Kullum ina cikin wahala.
And it is good that they are calling you for help.	Kuma yana da kyau su kira ku don neman taimako.
If it's good, just do it.	Idan yana da kyau, kawai yi shi.
But he could not stay in the house.	Amma ya kasa zama a gidan.
I tried it first.	Na gwada farko.
I want to do that.	Ina son yin hakan.
Decide to do some of it.	Yanke shawarar yin wasu daga ciki.
Save a lot of people.	Ajiye mutane da yawa.
She came and sat after a while.	Ta zo ta zauna bayan kadan.
You have never heard of such a thing.	Ba ka taba jin irin wannan ba.
This is correct.	Wannan daidai ne.
Everything is still there.	Komai na nan har yanzu.
Plan ahead and don't miss it !.	Shirya gaba kada ku rasa shi!.
This method is the only suitable one.	Wannan hanya ita ce kawai ta dace.
And not necessarily.	Kuma ba lallai ba ne.
There is nothing she loves more than to be with us.	Ba abin da ta fi so fiye da zama tare da mu.
Maybe there was something there, but she didn't see it.	Wataƙila akwai wani abu a wurin, amma ba ta gani ba.
She felt comfortable.	Ta ji dadi.
And that takes time.	Kuma hakan yana ɗaukar ɗan lokaci.
Write as you wish.	Rubuta yadda kuke so.
It should continue to function as expected.	Ya kamata ya ci gaba da aiki kamar yadda aka zata.
I am nothing.	Ni ba komai ba ne.
Now for some interesting things in the big outside !.	Yanzu ga wasu abubuwan ban sha'awa a cikin babban waje!.
Maybe it should start.	Wataƙila yakamata a fara.
You think you can do anything !.	Kuna tsammanin za ku iya yin komai!.
You have seen it before.	Kun taba gani a baya.
It was not like that before that night.	Ba haka yake ba kafin wannan dare.
Then wait two days.	Sai a jira kwana biyu.
We take what is given to us, he said.	Muna ɗaukar abin da aka ba mu, in ji shi.
He doesn't like me.	Ba ya so na.
We do things the way they should.	Muna yin abubuwa kamar yadda ya kamata a yi su.
Or it may be raining at night.	Ko kuma ana ruwan sama a daren.
But he can’t just be a police officer.	Amma ba zai iya zama ɗan sanda kawai ba.
But even if people do get a job, they are not good enough.	Amma ko da mutane sun sami aikin yi, ba su da kyau.
He wanted night.	Ya so dare.
Test others to see if they are finished.	Gwada wasu don ganin ko sun gama.

I will go there by myself.	Zan tafi can da kaina.
Life must go on.	Dole ne rayuwa ta ci gaba.

They are in a hurry.	Suna cikin sauri.
Either way, you go.	Ko ta yaya, kuna tafiya.
Please do not ask me about it.	Don Allah kar a tambaye ni game da shi.
Apart from that he is a big killer.	Baya ga cewa shi mai yawan kashe mutane ne.
It was a busy day.	Ya kasance ranar aiki.
You will find out soon.	Za ku gano da wuri.
The children went in and out of the room.	Yara sun shiga da fita daga dakin.
I could not believe myself.	Na kasa yarda da kaina.
I want everyone to have something tomorrow.	Ina son kowa ya sami abin gobe.
From there they travel by boat.	Daga nan suke tafiya ta jirgin ruwa.
He never knew.	Bai taba sani ba.
The water is hot today.	Ruwan yayi zafi yau.
A lot happens, a lot to do.	Da yawa ke faruwa, da yawa a yi.
You will not do it.	Ba za ku yi ba.

In general, it is wrong.	Gaba ɗaya ne, ba daidai ba ne.
She also got one.	Ita ma ta samu daya.

They told him to move to another house.	Suka yi masa magana ya koma wani babban gida.
I can't let him go.	Ba zan iya yarda ya tafi ba.
After that he spoke all the time.	Bayan haka ya yi magana a kowane lokaci.
But they did not get there.	Amma ba su isa wurin ba.
He hoped that did not happen.	Ya yi fatan hakan bai samu ba.
The killer has been arrested.	An kama wanda ya kashe shi.

Not my favorite.	Kada abin da na fi so.
For a while now.	Na ɗan lokaci yanzu.
Cannot recommend enough.	Ba za a iya ba da shawarar isa ba.
It may or may not be correct.	Zai iya zama daidai daidai, ko a'a.
He called back.	Ya kira a baya.
Maybe he was even in the past.	Wataƙila ma ya kasance a baya.
The car is getting better.	Motar ta kara kyau.
Not an internal affair.	Ba aikin ciki ba.
Unlike him.	Ba kamar shi ba.
How long will this take?	Har yaushe wannan zai ɗauki?
Maybe they can pick up where they left off.	Wataƙila za su iya ɗauka daga inda suka tsaya.
Better on some things.	Gara akan wasu abubuwa.
He will join the rest.	Zai shiga cikin sauran.
He was not a great genius.	Bai kasance babban mai hankali ba.
I do not know how to show this.	Ban san yadda zan nuna wannan ba.
It makes us remove a lot of himself at work.	Ya sa mu cire da yawa kansa a wurin aiki.
The end of the year.	Karshen shekara.
I said.	Na fada.
I didn’t catch it, at first.	Ban kama ba, da farko.
It seems that nothing is moving.	Da alama babu abin da yake tafiya.
So you have never seen it.	Don haka ba ku taɓa gani ba.
I waited but did not return.	Na jira amma bai dawo ba.
The next year was not a success.	Shekara mai zuwa ba ta yi nasara ba.
He does not like children.	Ba ya son yara.
In hindsight, that must have been the case.	Tunanin baya, tabbas abin ya kasance kenan.
It will not be a problem for me.	Ba zai zama matsala a gare ni ba.
People want to go home to a comfortable home.	Mutane suna son zuwa gida zuwa gida mai dadi.
She is at home.	Tana gida.
But for me it was wrong.	Amma a gare ni ba daidai ba ne.
Expect to get everything.	Yi tsammanin samun komai.
No one will come.	Babu wanda zai zo.
I agree we need to fix it.	Na yarda muna bukatar gyara.

You can't do anything.	Ba za ku iya yin komai ba.
Please respond soon.	Da fatan za a amsa nan da nan.
The reason for this is unknown.	Ba a san dalilin hakan ba.
But he could not do anything on his own.	Amma bai iya yin komai da kansa ba.
Everything comes.	Komai ya zo.
We walked on the road.	Muka yi tafiya a hanya.
I sat in the car.	Na zauna a cikin mota.
I am not one of the players.	Ba ni daya daga cikin 'yan wasan.
And he walks this path alone.	Kuma yana tafiya a wannan hanya shi kaɗai.
But it is still interesting.	Amma har yanzu yana da ban sha'awa.
I always printed it at home.	Na buga shi koyaushe a gida.
The ground is coming.	Kasa yana zuwa.
They get out of your way.	Suna fita daga hanyar ku.
They will grow.	Za su yi girma.
Maybe some water will help.	Wataƙila wani ruwa zai taimaka.
The boat to the mainland took off on time.	Jirgin ruwan zuwa babban kasa ya tashi akan lokaci.
But what I know has been very interesting.	Amma abin da na sani ya kasance mai daɗi sosai.
Who can give it to me.	Wanene zai iya ba ni.
I'm so surprised.	Ina ban mamaki haka.
However, he proved that it was not so easy.	Duk da haka, ya tabbatar da cewa bai kasance da sauƙi haka ba.
We have had problems many times.	Mun sami matsala sau da yawa.
Not for people at all.	Ba ga mutane ba ko kadan.
They must act and speak correctly.	Sai su yi aiki da magana daidai.
No matter what time, whatever you do.	Komai wane lokaci, komai kuke yi.
You just did it.	Kun yi shi kawai.
But of course nothing will.	Amma tabbas babu abin da zai.
No one knows that.	Babu wanda ya san haka.
She pretended not to hear it.	Ta yi kamar ba ta ji shi ba.
Someone wants.	Wani yana so.
I was studying and time passed.	Ina karatu kuma lokaci ya wuce.
I might get used to it one day.	Zan iya samun amfani don shi wata rana.
We take care of each other.	Muna kula da juna.
Or that something changed him.	Ko kuma cewa wani abu ya canza shi.
So, there is.	Don haka, akwai .
He has to hurry.	Dole ne ya yi sauri.
During.	A lokacin.
But for a while he got up and sat down.	Amma na dan lokaci ya tashi zaune.
Nothing to say.	Babu wani abin da za a ce.
It's good to have them inside.	Yana da kyau samun su a ciki.
Happy to talk about anything.	Mai farin cikin magana akan komai.
She is nearby.	Tana nan kusa.
Amazing stuff in itself.	Abin mamaki kayan da ke cikin kansa.
It really came to me.	Da gaske ya zo gare ni.
I wanted him back, but he couldn't.	Ina so ya dawo, amma bai samu ba.
If they succeed.	Idan nasara suka yi.
I have a daughter too.	Ina da 'ya kuma.
You know, the usual.	Ka sani, abubuwan da aka saba.
That is what we see today.	Abin da muke gani ke nan a yau.
That is life.	Wata rayuwa kenan.
All of this is true, and nothing of it.	Duk wannan gaskiya ne, kuma babu wani abu daga ciki.
You really are.	Da gaske kun kasance.
Many times they did.	Sau da yawa sun yi haka.
It is not looking up.	Ba neman sama ba ne.
It’s right on time, of course.	Daidai ne akan lokaci, ba shakka.
Hurry, he said.	Yi sauri, ya ce.
This, however, is not true.	Wannan, duk da haka, ba gaskiya ba ne.
But they are not always the same.	Amma ba koyaushe haka suke ba.
Of course it is.	Tabbas haka ne.
He was as honest as they came.	Shi mai gaskiya ne kamar yadda suka zo.
Everyone had a wonderful time.	Kowa ya sami lokacin ban mamaki.
Is anyone there still waiting?!?.	Akwai wani a can har yanzu jira?!?.
He has three daughters.	Yana da 'ya'ya mata uku.
Forget something like this has ever happened before.	Ka manta da wani abu na wannan ya taɓa faruwa.
Like, really take their time.	Kamar, da gaske dauki lokacin su.
I'm not comfortable.	Ba na yin dadi.
And maybe no one is enough to tell you what to think.	Kuma watakila babu wanda ya isa ya gaya muku abin da za ku yi tunani.
Stay ahead.	Tsaya gaba.
The police came to the house.	'Yan sanda sun zo gidan.
They want a better life.	Suna son rayuwa mafi kyau.
You made a mistake about me.	Kun yi kuskure game da ni.
I will not say here.	Ba zan fada a nan ba.
In fact, it can be said more than that.	A gaskiya ma, za a iya cewa fiye da haka.
Something else went wrong.	Wani abu kuma yayi kuskure.
We talked and that was it.	Mun yi magana kuma hakan ya kasance.
Nothing will understand.	Babu abin da zai gane.
In fact, he almost felt a little cold already.	A gaskiya ma, ya kusan jin ɗan sanyi riga.
The story of a man who walks in time.	Labarin mutumin da ke tafiya cikin lokaci.
There is no food in the house.	Babu abinci a gidan.
The time has come to stand for him.	Lokaci ya zo ya tsaya masa.
He was like that.	Ya kasance irin wannan.
And it is amazing.	Kuma abin mamaki ne.
I don't know who that might be.	Ban san wanda hakan zai iya zama ba.
This is nothing new.	Hakan ma ba sabon abu bane.
We need rain.	Muna bukatar ruwan sama.
You are a child.	Kai yaro ne.
I have no problem with it.	Ban sami matsala da shi ba.
They can suggest someone to talk to.	Suna iya ba da shawarar wani da za ku yi magana da ku.
You can't just love it.	Ba za ku iya kawai so shi ba.
It happens, though.	Yana faruwa, ko da yake.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Kowa ya san zai kasance a wurin.
This work is the problem of time recovery.	Wannan aikin shine matsalar dawo da lokaci.
He called everything as he saw it.	Ya kira komai kamar yadda ya gani.
No wonder you won’t say.	Ba mamaki ba za ku fada ba.
It works slowly and slowly.	Tana aiki a hankali kuma a hankali.
I must take the time to talk to you.	Dole ne in ba da lokaci don yin magana da ku.
He doesn't have that.	Ba shi da wannan.
I never failed there.	Ban taba kasa a can ba.
They immediately did.	Nan da nan suka yi.
I can sleep on the floor.	Zan iya kwana a kasa.
My coffee is cold.	Kofi na yana yin sanyi.
It needs work.	Yana bukatar aikin.
Nor do they want to.	Haka kuma ba sa so.
All you have to fear is the heat.	Duk abin da za ku ji tsoro shine zafi.
Two things about that.	Abubuwa biyu game da wannan.
I thought it would be difficult, but it was not.	Ina tsammanin zai yi wahala, amma ba haka ba.
The three of us were running.	Mu uku ne ke gudu.
This is a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne.
It did not start well.	Bai fara da kyau ba.
He did not know how he did it.	Bai san yadda ya yi ba.
Food is better there.	Abinci ya fi can.
We didn't think so.	Ba mu yi tunanin hakan ba.
It's easy.	Yana da sauƙi.
That is too much for me.	Wannan yana da yawa a gare ni.
They don’t want to have more access to it.	Ba sa so su ƙara samun dama a kai.
We got a job.	Mun samu aiki.
I would recommend this several times.	Zan ba da shawarar wannan sau da yawa.
But if.	Amma idan.
She will know what to do.	Zata san me zata yi.
We only ate twice.	Muna ci sau biyu ne kawai.
I can only have fun.	Zan iya jin daɗi kawai.
You give me a lot of new food to think about.	Kuna ba ni sabon abinci mai yawa don tunani.
And in fact, that works for me.	Kuma a gaskiya, abin da ke aiki a gare ni.
When you need it just take it.	Lokacin da kuke buƙatar shi kawai ku ɗauka.
We have nothing against it.	Ba mu da komai a kansa.
You can move on now.	Kuna iya ci gaba yanzu.
I have come to this in the last three years.	Na zo wannan a cikin shekaru uku da suka gabata.
Better late than never!	Gara a makara fiye da taba!
I did like that.	Na yi kamar haka.
We will work with you.	Za mu yi aiki tare da ku.
He will surely return.	Zai tabbata zai dawo.
Failure to do so.	Rashin yin bata.
I will accept that.	Zan yarda da hakan.
What you said at the time was good.	Abin da kuka fada a lokacin yana da kyau.
I do not know how to print it.	Ban san yadda zan buga shi ba.
However, they can be difficult to answer at all.	Duk da haka, suna iya zama da wahala a ba da amsa gaba ɗaya.
Maybe you should get into a lot of scary stuff.	Wataƙila ya kamata ku shiga cikin ban dariya mai ban tsoro.
It is not enough.	Bai isa ba.
I was surprised by it.	Na sha mamaki da shi.
We are not what they are after.	Mu ba abin da suke bayan.
Sometimes children do not need help and sometimes they need a lot.	Wani lokaci yara ba sa buƙatar taimako kuma wani lokacin suna buƙatar da yawa.
You have to test if it works here.	Dole ne ku gwada idan yana aiki a nan.
He said quickly.	Ya fada da sauri.
I would never have done that at home.	Da ban taba yin haka a gida ba.
He will get more food and drink himself.	Zai sami ƙarin abinci da abin sha da kansa.
This is to be.	Wannan shi ne don zama.
This is a surprise.	Wannan abin mamaki ne.
Then it all failed.	Daga nan duk ya yi kasa.
And she took me to the beach.	Kuma ta kai ni bakin ruwa.
And I was employed.	Kuma an yi mini aiki.
You do what you need to do.	Kuna yin abin da kuke buƙatar yi.
I am here tomorrow.	Ina nan gobe.
I thought you would like to try it out.	Na yi tsammanin za ku so ku gwada.
I checked the time	Na duba lokaci
Will it rain?	Ruwa zai yi?
That's what I did.	Haka na yi.
But for her, the effort was not enough.	Amma a gare ta, ƙoƙarin bai isa ba.
People cannot even see what they are.	Mutane ma ba za su iya ganin abin da suke ba.
This is the way of the world.	Wannan ita ce hanyar duniya.
I'll just tell him.	Zan gaya masa kawai.
This is very close.	Wannan yana kusa sosai.
He knew when to stop and wait.	Ya san lokacin da zai tsaya da jira.
You have nothing.	Ba ku da komai.
They are afraid of them and should be.	Suna tsoron su kuma ya kamata.
Getting him to understand more things.	Samun shi ya fahimci ƙarin abubuwa.
It can be anyone.	Zai iya zama kowa.
Come and see.	Ku zo mu duba tare.
There is no way that this can happen.	Babu wata hanya da hakan zai iya faruwa .
It's a game for her.	Wasa ne ya mata.
I have to refuse.	Dole ne in ƙi.
Making dinner will be fun.	Yin abincin dare zai zama mai daɗi.
Must be sold.	Dole ne a sayar.

Another train seemed to be leaving.	Wani jirgin kasa yayi kamar zai tafi.
I would like coffee	Ina son kofi
Every meal is better than the last.	Kowane abinci ya fi na ƙarshe kyau.
Remember when they started this year.	Ka tuna lokacin da suka fara wannan shekara guda.
Or they may not have thought.	Ko kuma ba su yi tunani ba.
The problem is, there has never been any rain here.	Matsalar ita ce, ba a taɓa yin ruwan sama a nan ba.
But one way or another he went.	Amma wata hanya ko wata sai ya tafi.
Whatever you want.	Duk abin da kuke so.
She got up.	Ta tashi.
No wait, this is also a lie.	A'a jira, wannan ma karya ce.
I am not surprised by it.	Ba na mamaki da shi.
Everything will be fine.	Komai zai kasance lafiya.
She can't get sick.	Ba za ta iya rashin lafiya ba.
That will change, they say.	Wannan zai canza, in ji su.
Job	Aiki
Can anyone help me fix this.	Shin kowa zai iya taimaka mini don gyara wannan.
Sometimes this happens.	Wani lokaci hakan na faruwa.
It is drinking water.	Ruwan sha ne.
I understand it is necessary.	Na fahimci ya zama dole.
I think you will.	Ina tsammanin za ku.
Maybe he should go.	Wataƙila ya kamata ya tafi.
He is not filled with self or his thoughts more than others.	Ba ya cika da kansa ko tunanin kansa fiye da sauran.
Now you know where you are.	Yanzu kun san inda kuke.
And of course everyone caught him.	Kuma tabbas kowa ya kama shi.
Walking is difficult after injury.	Tafiya yana da wahala bayan rauni.
It's really nice.	Yana da kyau gaske.
Can you tell us about the past?	Za ku iya gaya mana abubuwan da suka gabata?
They left many years ago.	Sun tafi shekaru da yawa da suka wuce.
You love this new fast food restaurant.	Kuna son wannan sabon wurin abinci mai sauri.

That's why he wants to come here.	Shi ya sa yake son zuwa nan.
Now you see.	Yanzu kun gani.

Not that we're good though.	Ba cewa muna da kyau ko da yake.
There was nothing to do at the time.	Babu wani abu da za a yi a lokacin.
I sent a request	Na aika bukata
But it must be done in the right way.	Amma dole ne a yi hakan ta hanyar da ta dace.
So should we.	Haka ya kamata mu.
You are made for it.	An yi ku don shi.
There is no room for error in this work.	Babu wurin kuskure a cikin wannan aikin.
He will not do it for all of us.	Ba zai yi ma mu duka a kama mu ba.
It's time to move on, she thought.	Lokaci ya yi da za a ci gaba da wani abu, ta yi tunani.
You could say that she likes what she sees.	Kuna iya cewa tana son abin da ta gani.
But start thinking about that.	Amma ku fara tunanin hakan.
At the weekend.	A karshen mako.
If you do not want to live, so be it.	Idan ba ka son rayuwa, haka ya kasance.
Honestly, money is not an issue.	Gaskiya, kudi ba magana ba ne.

And you will wait until tomorrow.	Kuma za a jira har gobe.
Nothing he knows now.	Babu wani abu da ya san shi a yanzu.
I hope it works for you !.	Ina fatan zai yi muku aiki!.
Sometimes things take a while.	Wani lokaci abubuwa suna ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Besides, you're good to go.	Baya ga haka kun yi kyau.
But nothing more.	Amma babu wani abu kuma.
I was very sick.	Na yi rashin lafiya sosai.
And if you don’t.	Kuma idan ba ku yi ba.
Not sure when, but be prepared.	Ban tabbata yaushe ba, amma ku shirya.
She did not want to miss out.	Ba ta so ta rasa damar.
So you really came out on your own here.	Don haka da gaske kun fita da kanku a nan.
She spends all the winter indoors.	Ta yi duk lokacin sanyi a cikin gida.

What happened?	Me ya faru?
I know you're doing one.	Na san kana yin daya.
We have worked together once before.	Mun yi aiki tare sau ɗaya a baya .
The work seemed unintelligible.	Aikin ya zama kamar ba su da hankali.
She could not come up with anything.	Ta kasa fito da komai.
We are here and we love you.	Muna nan kuma muna son ku.
And in the water.	Kuma a cikin ruwa.
That has changed.	Hakan ya canza.
As soon as he got the goods he got up.	Sai da ya samu kayan ya tashi.
It can't be that way.	Ba za a iya zama irin wannan ba.
Now, he finally does something.	Yanzu, a ƙarshe yana yin wani abu.
However, that is what it is.	Duk da haka, shi ne abin da yake.
But she is at home.	Amma tana gida.
Let me be right.	Bari in zama daidai.
I want to cover them with something.	Ina so in rufe su da wani abu.
Together we saw the sun rise.	Muna tare sai muka ga rana ta fito.
We do.	Muna haka.
So we don't want that either.	Don haka mu ma ba ma son hakan.
Stand on the floor.	Tsaya a kasa.
We don't see anything.	Ba mu ganin komai.
Enough has already happened.	Ya isa ya riga ya faru.
She was taken care of.	An kula da ita.
The world is safe.	Duniya ta kasance lafiya.
So we got the one we got.	Don haka mun sami wanda muka samu.
Never buy more than two or three items at a time.	Kada a taɓa siyan abubuwa sama da biyu ko uku a lokaci ɗaya.
Or from himself.	Ko daga kansa.
You want to tell me who said what and when.	Kuna son gaya mani wanda ya ce me kuma yaushe.
I want to see more of this !.	Ina son ganin ƙarin wannan!.
It is better to be on time.	Zai fi kyau a kasance a kan lokaci.
Beat it.	Duka shi.
It just has to be real.	Kawai ya kasance na gaske.
With everyone, really.	Tare da kowa, da gaske.
So there is no problem there.	Don haka babu matsala a can.
And get people to know you are there.	Da kuma samun mutane su san ka akwai.
You have something smart going on right now.	Kuna da wani abu mai hankali yana tafiya yanzu.
It can happen to anyone.	Zai iya faruwa ga kowa.
As a result, several people were arrested.	Saboda haka, an kama mutane da yawa.
But life has shown us otherwise.	Amma rayuwa ta nuna mana ba haka ba ne.
It was not easy.	Ba a yi sauƙi ba.
You should.	Ya kamata ku.
Maybe he was.	Wataƙila ya kasance.
I must be cut open.	Dole ne a yanke ni a bude.
There is nothing there.	Babu wani abu a wurin.
I will come back to life.	Zan dawo rayuwa.
However, this does not feel right to me.	Duk da haka, wannan baya jin daidai a gare ni.
Of course it pays well.	Tabbas ya biya sosai.
He shows them sitting.	Ya nuna su a zaune.
I am here.	Ina nan a nan.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
I was married at the time.	Na yi aure a lokacin.
That's what she said.	Haka ta ce.
He would never leave her.	Ba zai taba barin ta ba.
You need to get a job.	Kuna buƙatar samun aiki.
It can't be anything.	Ba zai iya zama komai ba.
It is the best home I have ever seen.	Shi ne mafi kyawun gida da aka taɓa gani.
He used to think of something like this too.	Ya kasance yana tunanin wani abu kamar wannan kuma.
However, he wanted more.	Duk da haka, ya so ƙarin.
Everything is going as usual.	Komai yana tafiya kamar yadda aka saba.
However, we played a little after she ate dinner.	Duk da haka, mun yi wasa kadan bayan ta ci abincin dare.
We weren’t even where we were when you left home.	Ba ma zama inda muka yi lokacin da kuka bar gida ba.
Buy a home.	Sayi gida.
If you fail, everything.	Idan kun kasa, komai.
They were really ahead of me.	Da gaske sun kasance gaba da ni.
It will not work.	Ba zai yi aiki ba.
It would be nice.	Zai yi kyau.
It has become weaker for you.	Ya zama mafi rauni a gare ku.
And she is always beautiful.	Kuma tana da kyau koyaushe.
People help each other.	Mutane suna taimakon juna.
Me and me and me and me.	Ni da ni da ni da ni.
I felt sick at night.	Na ji rashin lafiya da dare.
We will not talk about it anymore.	Ba za mu ƙara yin magana game da shi ba yanzu.
If they can't, he'll be glad you did.	Idan ba za su iya yin nasara ba, ya yi farin ciki da kuka yi.

I reached out and raised my voice.	Na kai hannu na ƙara ƙara.

The rest is just ahead.	Sauran abubuwan sun kasance kawai na gaba.
This drive is there.	Wannan tuƙi a can.
So, it's a little cold.	Don haka, ya ɗan yi sanyi.
And, that does exactly that.	Kuma, wannan yana yin daidai daidai.
There is a time when they can.	Akwai lokacin da za su iya.
He never did that.	Bai taba yin haka ba.
It is not necessary.	Ba dole ba ne.

He is getting up.	Yana kan tashi.
In food.	A cikin abinci.
And why not.	Kuma me yasa ba.
It is the only way.	Ita ce kawai hanya.
He brought out three heads.	Ya fito da kai uku.
She is not well.	Ba ta da kyau.
Maybe he went back to her.	Watakila ya koma mata.
No, it is better.	A'a, ya fi haka.
I always take them to school.	Kullum na kai su makaranta.
It helped, for a while.	Ya taimaka, na ɗan lokaci.
Third, it brings pleasure and enjoyment.	Na uku, yana sa jin daɗi da jin daɗi.
But it can't be done.	Amma ba za a iya yi ba.
Less thought of it.	Kadan aka yi tunanin shi.
Seeing him speak so loudly that he was left alone.	Ganin ya yi magana sosai ya sa ya zama shi kaɗai.
But now, nothing.	Amma yanzu, babu komai.
And only then did it be signed.	Kuma kawai sai aka sanya hannu.
We made money on it.	Mun yi kudi a kai.
Nothing more.	Babu wani abu kuma.
I have never done that before.	Ban taba yin haka ba tukuna.
Look, just forget it.	Duba, kawai manta shi.
Everything happened so fast.	Komai ya faru da sauri.
They have a name.	Suna da suna.
I wanted to remove them, because they are too big.	Na so a cire su, saboda sun yi girma da yawa.
Strange, but true.	Abin ban mamaki, amma gaskiya.
We saw him become a man.	Mun ga ya zama mutum.
The man said it was raining.	Mutumin ya ce ana ta yin ruwan sama.
But you can't wait for her.	Amma ka kasa jira ta.
I thought it was amazing !.	Na yi tunanin cewa yana da ban mamaki!.
If that's what you want.	Idan abin da kuke so ke nan.
You are doing your best.	Kuna yin mafi kyawun sa.
They are not interested in such things.	Ba su da sha'awar irin waɗannan abubuwa.
Maybe they still do.	Wataƙila har yanzu suna yi.
But this will take some time.	Amma wannan zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci.
I'm glad you enjoyed the book.	Na yi farin ciki da kuka ji daɗin littafin.
Leave this now.	Bar wannan a yanzu.
If they are here.	Idan suna nan.
More and more runners are slowly entering.	Ƙarin masu gudu a hankali suna shiga.
You can tell me.	Kuna iya gaya mani.
Remove from heat.	Cire daga zafi.
Just everything you want to put in it.	Kawai duk abin da kuke so ku saka a ciki.
I feel so good.	Na ji dadi sosai.
Last day, some of the best died.	Ranar ƙarshe, wasu daga cikin mafi kyawun su mutu.
They reached us.	Suka isa gare mu.
It's over.	Ya wuce.
The suspect was arrested at the scene.	An kama wanda ake zargin a wurin.
I never thought of that.	Ban taba tunanin hakan ba.
For many readers it will look like.	Ga masu karatu da yawa za su yi kama.
He knew there was no sleep tonight.	Ya san babu barci a daren nan.
This has been a problem for years.	Wannan ya kasance matsala tsawon shekaru.
We kept waiting.	Muka ci gaba da jira.
Everyone here has reached something.	Kowa a nan ya kai ga wani abu.
Or food.	Ko abinci.
It could be anything or anyone.	Zai iya zama wani abu ko kowa.
It should be around one person.	Ya kamata a kusa da mutum ɗaya.
She did everything she could to help.	Ta yi duk abin da za ta taimaka.
You are required.	Ana buƙatar ku.
There must be a better way.	Dole ne a sami hanya mafi kyau.
The story is true.	Labarin ya zama gaskiya.
Really kind of amazing.	Gaskiya irin ban mamaki.
I didn't even see it.	Ban ma gani ba.
The person speaking is not present.	Mutumin da ke yin magana ba ya nan.
As we did.	Kamar yadda muka yi.
It really is now.	Yana da gaske a yanzu.
Ask him out well if he is no longer absorbed in the connection.	Ku tambaye shi, zai zo.
But it is much more than that.	Amma ya fi haka yawa.
That's why she doesn't like you, you know.	Shi ya sa ba ta son ka, ka sani.
Give us the best opportunity.	Ka ba mu dama mafi kyau.
You heard her.	Kun ji ta.
This car is moving fast.	Wannan motar tana tafiya da sauri.
Do not speak until you have been spoken to.	Kada ku yi magana sai an yi magana da ku.
I do not trust you.	Ban yarda da ku ba.
It's just one of many.	Daya ne kawai daga cikin da yawa.
But they did nothing to us.	Amma ba su yi mana komai ba.
No one will say anything.	Babu wanda zai ce komai.
When they were here, they were smart.	A lokacin da suka kasance a nan, sun kasance masu hankali.
It feels like rain.	Ji kamar ruwan sama.
You need to prove yourself.	Kuna buƙatar tabbatar da kanku.
So eat what you can, when you can.	Don haka ku ci abin da za ku iya, lokacin da za ku iya.
I really think they will do me good.	A gaskiya ina jin za su yi min kyau.
It is not an easy task.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
The time is not right.	Lokacin bai dace ba.
Injury to it, he can feel now.	Rauni a kai, zai iya ji yanzu.
Everything you can do will be fine.	Duk abin da za ku iya yi zai yi kyau.
People love this place and live here.	Mutane suna son wannan wuri kuma suna zaune a nan.
A good player with speed.	Kyakkyawan dan wasa tare da gudu.
I waited for him to get up again.	Na jira ya sake tashi.
Not now, not yet.	Ba yanzu, ba tukuna.
They all hated him.	Duk sun ƙi shi.
Close but not enough.	Kusa amma ba a isa ba.
Twice since.	Sau biyu tun daga.
No one has ever signed anything.	Babu wanda ya taba sanya hannu a wani abu.
But no one knows how much.	Amma ba wanda ya san nawa ne.
This is good.	Wannan yana da kyau.
Everyone has a past.	Kowa yana da abin da ya wuce.
She did not know how he felt.	Ba ta san yadda yake ji ba.
Sometimes, it just went away.	Wani lokaci, kawai ya tafi.
We'd better stay here.	Gara mu dade a nan.
He looked very weak.	Ya yi kama da rauni sosai.
He came home empty-handed.	Ya zo gida babu kowa a gida.
But they did not tell him.	Amma ba su gaya masa ba.
I wonder what brought about this passion.	Ina mamakin me ya kawo wannan sha'awar.
I started to like this place a lot.	Na fara son wannan wurin da yawa.
Then we thought someone was going to take us.	Sai muka ga kamar wani zai tafi da mu.
It is cold outside.	Akwai sanyi a waje.
No no it can't be.	A'a a'a ba zai iya zama ba.
We are thinking of things that are not finished yet.	Muna tunanin abubuwan da ba a gama ba tukuna.
However, it appears to be an attempt to grow.	Duk da haka, yana bayyana ƙoƙari ne na girma.
I would even say we are happy.	Zan ma ce mun yi farin ciki.
A week or two will not hurt.	Wani mako ko biyu ba zai yi rauni ba.
I was less than three years old at the time.	A lokacin ban kai shekara uku ba.
He even grew up.	Har ma ya girma.
Let her talk to me.	Bari ta yi min magana.
I think very few will take the second option.	Ina tsammanin cewa kaɗan ne za su ɗauki hanya ta biyu.
They, however, are not alone.	Su, duk da haka, ba su kaɗai ba.
But some things went well.	Amma wasu abubuwa sun yi kyau sosai.
Someone will come out of this.	Wani zai fito daga wannan.
But everything has changed.	Amma komai ya canza.
I have never seen anything like it.	Ban taba ganin irin wannan ba.
He certainly did not succeed.	Babu shakka bai yi nasara ba.
At least it was.	Ko kadan ya kasance.
We should not be surprised that it is difficult.	Kada mu yi mamakin cewa yana da wahala.
And that's it.	Kuma shi ke nan.
So you do not know.	Don haka ba ku sani ba.
Many say what they like best.	Mutane da yawa sun ce abin da suka fi so.
She must know everything.	Dole ta san komai.
It took a lot of effort.	Ya ɗauki ƙoƙari sosai.
I have no one to go with.	Ba ni da wanda zan tafi tare.
No one spoke to her like that.	Ba wanda yayi mata magana haka.
I did well at that.	Na yi kyau a wannan.
Hopefully it will continue to move slowly.	Da fatan za a ci gaba da tafiya a hankali.
Gradually she became obsessed with that.	A hankali ta damu da hakan.
Do you feel like walking?	Kuna jin kamar yin tafiya?
I began to think that maybe it was a good time.	Na fara tunanin cewa watakila lokaci ne mai kyau.
Almost no one is prepared for that.	Kusan babu wanda aka shirya don haka.
I began to accept it personally.	Na fara yarda da shi da kaina.
I couldn’t live with it and work too much.	Ba zan iya zama tare da shi ba kuma in yi aiki da yawa.
I laugh about that, too.	Ina dariya game da hakan, kuma.
It was easy to operate.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi don aiki.
I told everyone who would listen.	Na gaya wa duk wanda zai ji.
It just came out a little bit.	Sai da ya dan fito kadan.
But he gives me the next mistake.	Amma yana bani kuskure mai zuwa.
This time it looks amazing.	Wannan lokacin yana kama da ban mamaki.
You certainly can't do that now.	Lallai ba za ku iya yin hakan ba yanzu.
He is honest.	Mai gaskiya ne.
Everything must be done properly.	Dole ne a yi komai yadda ya kamata.
I may be familiar with this.	Zan iya saba da wannan.
I don't feel that way at all.	Bani da wannan jin ko kadan.
I never understood him.	Ban taba gane shi ba.
That's what we're going to do.	Abin da za mu yi ke nan.
I told him we would pass in the afternoon.	Na ce masa za mu wuce da rana.
So don’t worry too much.	Don haka kada ku damu da yawa.
They told him not to do that to people.	Suka ce masa kada ya yi wa mutane haka.
Selfishly, he hoped he would be the first to come.	Da son kai, ya yi fatan shi ne zai fara zuwa.
This, however, failed to do so.	Wannan, duk da haka, ya kasa yin hakan.
This is a joy for us.	Wannan lokacin farin ciki ne a gare mu.
We love her.	Muna son ta.
But one more player may be needed.	Amma ana iya buƙatar ƙarin ɗan wasa ɗaya.
And that may be.	Kuma cewa yana iya zama.
No time for now.	Babu lokaci don haka yanzu.
This is a big setback for the project.	Wannan babban koma baya ne ga aikin.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
We had to turn on the water.	Sai da muka kunna ruwa a kai.
Let's leave it there.	Bari mu bar shi a can.
We know some but not enough.	Mun san wasu amma ba su isa ba.
Sorry not enough at this point.	Yi hakuri bai isa ba a wannan lokacin.
One by one.	Daya zuwa daya.
And not every fight should happen.	Kuma ba kowane fada ya kamata ya faru ba.
I'll start with mine.	Zan fara da nawa.
He did not feel very well.	Bai ji dadi sosai ba.
This is not good.	Wannan ba shi da kyau.
Frighten.	Ba tsoro.
I usually stop giving these things though.	Na kan daina barin waɗannan abubuwan duk da haka.
It's really scary.	Gaskiya abin ban tsoro ne.
I'm not surprised he didn't remarry.	Ban yi mamaki bai kara aure ba.
It is a difficult task.	Aiki ne mai wahala.
It's over.	Ya wuce.
Their call came.	Da suka kira ya zo.
I don't want to see it again.	Ba na son in sake ganin abin.
Good night.	Ku kwana mai kyau.
He showed me once.	Ya nuna min sau daya.
But she is not married.	Amma ba ta yi aure ba.
Something good, he thought.	Wani kyakkyawan abu, ya yi tunani.
It can lie.	Zai iya yin karya.
But there is no time to talk about that.	Amma babu lokacin magana game da wannan.
The problem is, there are so many things.	Matsalar ita ce, akwai abubuwa da yawa.
A year earlier.	Shekara daya kafin haka.
Which was, in the end.	Wanda ya kasance, a karshen.
The material is simple.	Kayan yana da sauƙi.
And they will tell you that when he comes.	Kuma za su gaya muku cewa idan ya zo.
You guys don’t.	Ku mutane ba ku.
It's just time.	Lokaci ne kawai.
This went better than the last.	Wannan ya tafi mafi kyau fiye da na ƙarshe.
He drank to this place.	Ya sha zuwa wannan wurin.
Indeed, they are the only ones.	Lallai kamar su kadai ne.
Maybe they are smart.	Wataƙila suna da hankali.
There is no way he will stop now.	Babu yadda zai tsaya yanzu.
Then another.	Sai kuma wani.
I am now myself.	Ni yanzu da kaina.
Of course.	Ya tabbata.
I doubt there will be much.	Ina shakka ko za a yi da yawa.
He was injured.	Ya ji rauni.
This is.	Wannan shine.
Or a lot of water.	Ko ruwa mai yawa.
She grew up there, you know.	Ta girma a can, ka sani.
Nothing was left behind.	Ba abin da ya kasance bayan.
Such discomfort.	Irin wannan rashin jin daɗi.
I have never been here.	Ban taba zuwa nan ba.
They do not want to know and do not want you to know.	Ba sa son su sani kuma ba sa son ku ma ku sani.
Obviously, do everything you can.	Babu shakka, yi duk abin da za ku iya.
She heard it.	Ta ji ta.
Work a little harder and play more.	Yi aiki kaɗan kuma ƙara wasa.
But he will not do it.	Amma ba zai yi ba.
Maybe they wanted me to stand up for myself.	Wataƙila sun so in tsaya wa kaina.
And in the end, they did what was right for me.	Kuma a ƙarshe, sun yi abin da ya dace da ni.
I feel like he is there.	Ina jin kamar yana can.
We want to make sure that does not happen again.	Muna son tabbatar da cewa hakan bai sake faruwa ba.
They don’t expect anyone to get that.	Ba sa tsammanin kowa zai samu haka.
You can see nothing but money.	Ba a iya ganin komai sai kudi.
Do it right.	Yi aiki da shi daidai.
It was never enough safe.	Bai taba isa ba lafiya.
It really looks like a lot of simple work.	Da gaske yana kama da babban aiki mai sauƙi.
These players have a chance this year.	Waɗannan 'yan wasan suna da damar su a wannan shekara.
That is not the case today.	A yau ba haka yake ba.
And fail me.	Kuma kasa ni.
They were put together in a new home.	An sanya su tare a cikin sabon gida.
So she has to fix it.	Don haka dole ta gyara.
This, of course, should not happen.	Wannan, ba shakka, bai kamata ya faru ba.
Can we talk.	Za mu iya magana.
But not only that.	Amma ba haka kawai ba.
I have time.	Ina da lokaci.
I can't do it for her.	Ba zan iya yi mata ba.
It's a pleasure.	Abin farin ciki ne.
I want to sit down and think a little.	Ina so in zauna in yi tunani kadan.
It can bring new years.	Zai iya kawo sabon shekaru.
It will not bother you to spend the night there.	Ba zai damu ka kwana a can ba.
Before that, they were fast.	Kafin wannan, suna da sauri.
About me.	A kaina.
We will show that.	Za mu nuna hakan.
I think they felt uncomfortable.	Ina tsammanin sun ji ba dadi.
We hope the decision can help you!	Muna fatan cewa shawarar zata iya taimaka muku!.
I changed the channel.	Na canza tashar.
He is not well.	Ba shi da lafiya.
She started drinking and stopped eating.	Ta fara sha ta daina ci.
But for me, the movie is really good.	Amma a gare ni, fim ɗin yana da kyau sosai.
This guy is having fun !.	Wannan mutumin yana jin daɗi!.
He smokes.	Yana shan taba.
I have never felt back.	Ban taba jin baya ba.
You will not go there.	Ba za ku je can ba.
He surprised him with how he felt.	Ya ba shi mamaki yadda ya ji.
Remember, you do not have to smoke.	Ka tuna, ba dole ba ne ka sha taba.
Let him go and get ready.	Bari ya je ya shirya.
It is good for life.	Yana da kyau ga rai.
It should.	Kamata yayi.
It all takes time.	Duk yana ɗaukar lokaci.
Nor do we want it to be.	Haka kuma ba ma so ya kasance.
So think again.	Don haka a sake tunani.
That she learned to play for me.	Cewa ta koyi wasa saboda ni.
Knowing this, too, will come to an end.	Sanin wannan ma, zai zo ƙarshe.
Maybe they will go.	Wataƙila za su tafi.
Keep checking it out if you don’t agree with me.	Ci gaba da duba shi idan ba ku yarda da ni ba.
There seems to be more girls in this project.	Da alama an sami ƙarin 'yan mata a wannan aikin.
We had a better time.	Mun sami lokaci mafi kyau.
I want to die.	Ina so in mutu.
And rightly so.	Kuma yayi daidai.
She thought about going, she decided she wouldn't do it.	Ta yi tunanin tafiya, ta yanke shawarar ba za ta yi ba.
I don't care.	Ban damu da hakan ba.
They just talked to each other.	Sun dan yi magana da juna.
Immediately, this became the norm.	Nan da nan, wannan ya zama abin da ya dace.
It seems to work.	Da alama yayi aiki.
Yet they kept coming.	Amma duk da haka sun ci gaba da zuwa.
But it must be too much.	Amma dole ne ya yi yawa.
Honestly I don’t care who wins.	Gaskiya ban damu da wanda zai yi nasara ba.
This is a trip.	Wannan tafiya ce.
Immediately we do not want to be around them.	Nan take ba ma son zama kusa da su.
I have never been a doer of that.	Ban taba zama mai yin hakan ba.
I don't know anything like that.	Ban san wani abu irin wannan ba.
Now, however, she doesn’t care.	Yanzu, duk da haka, ba ta damu ba.
This is it.	Wannan shi ne.
I really enjoyed it, really.	Na yi farin ciki da shi, da gaske.
They don't remember me.	Bata tuna ni ba.
He will not enter.	Ba zai shiga ba.
She continued.	Ta ci gaba.
Try them for a while.	Gwada su na ɗan lokaci.
They put work above all else.	Sun sanya aiki sama da komai.
This happens without many people discovering and it happens every year.	Wannan yana faruwa ba tare da mutane da yawa sun gano ba kuma yana faruwa kowace shekara.
They really were.	Da gaske sun kasance.
They love their players anyway.	Suna son 'yan wasan su ta wata hanya.
Some may need to be paid.	Wasu na iya buƙatar a biya su.
I think you will really enjoy it.	Ina tsammanin za ku ji daɗi sosai.
He is always talking.	Kullum magana yake.
By this time she had arrived home.	A wannan lokacin ta isa gida.
This place, however, is not ideal.	Wannan wurin, duk da haka, ba shi da kyau.
Let's think more.	Mu kara tunani.
He broke something again.	Ya sake karya wani abu.
He left.	Ya tafi.
The car is not working properly.	Mota na baya aiki yadda yakamata.
Everything he says should be given time.	Duk abin da ya ce sai a ba shi lokaci.
I will never do that again.	Ba zan sake yin hakan ba.
Or, they talk.	Ko kuma, suna magana.
I missed the game.	Na rasa wasan.
I kept doing that.	Na ci gaba da yin haka.
About money.	Game da kudi.
Right with us.	Dama tare da mu.
Stay with me.	Zauna da ni.
Not so.	Ba kamar haka ba.
And we will talk.	Kuma za mu yi magana.
I can not wait to read many of you.	Ba zan iya jira in karanta da yawa daga gare ku ba.
I think it should be you.	Ina ganin yakamata ya zama ku.
He was slow, but it worked.	Ya kasance a hankali, amma ya yi aiki.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
Are you afraid of what might happen?	Kuna tsoron abin da zai iya faruwa?
So it went for a while.	Haka ya tafi na ɗan lokaci .
It seems to be even weaker now.	Da alama ma ya fi rauni a yanzu.
This is not very good, but it is better.	Wannan ba shi da kyau sosai, amma ya fi kyau.
And it's cold here.	Kuma akwai sanyi a nan.
We call each one.	Muna kan kira kowane.
I think you are not well.	Ina tsammanin ba ku da lafiya.
It's been a long time.	Ya dade.
It hurts.	Ya ji zafi.
She knew them by name.	Ta san su da suna.
They decided that they could do it.	Sun yanke shawarar cewa za su iya yin hakan.
I will say something to her.	Zan ce mata wani abu.
I did not hear anything from him.	Ban ji komai daga gare shi ba.
Nice to see you.	Da kyau ganin ku.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
We still have to prepare.	Har yanzu dole mu shirya.
And maybe he knows how to do it.	Kuma watakila ya san yadda yake yi.
She never trusted me.	Ba ta taba yarda da ni ba.
They will know nothing for a while.	Ba za su san komai ba na ɗan lokaci.
Sit down one.	A zaune daya.
But we are still waiting for an answer.	Amma har yanzu muna jiran amsa.
Sometimes they finally get it, sometimes it doesn’t.	Wani lokaci a ƙarshe suna samun shi, wani lokacin ba haka ba.
They think it's time for you to have some fun.	Suna tsammanin lokaci ya yi da za ku sami ɗan jin daɗi.
It will never happen.	Ba zai taba faruwa ba.
I never got it.	Ban taba samun shi ba.
And you are.	Kuma kai ne .
You can get it and see how it works.	Kuna iya samun shi kuma ku duba yadda yake aiki.
I only added it though.	Na kara da shi kawai in ko da yake.
You should have written to me.	Da ma ka rubuta min.
First and only.	Na farko kuma kawai.
Women do.	Mata suna yi.
They will not pay anything extra.	Ba za su biya ƙarin wani abu ba.
There is one of you.	Akwai daya daga cikin ku.
It will not do well.	Ba zai yi kyau ba.
We did not miss them.	Ba mu rasa su ba.
They have never been so.	Ba su taɓa zama har yanzu haka ba.
Every night, really.	Duk dare, da gaske.
So just in time.	Don haka kawai a lokacin.
I began to think of traveling on my own.	Na fara tunanin tafiya da kaina.
But it is a close call.	Amma kira ne na kusa.
It feels good.	Ya ji dadi.
Start like.	Fara kamar.
This is how you should do it.	Wannan shine yadda ya kamata ku yi.
I don’t care about school, or money, or success.	Ba na damu da makaranta, ko kudi, ko nasara.
Are you done yet?	Kun gama aiki tukuna?
I can say she was crying.	Zan iya cewa tana kuka.
I think we have to take it.	Ina tsammanin dole ne mu ɗauka.
He felt helpless.	Ya ji rashin taimako.
The road flew from it.	Hanya ta tashi daga gare ta.
You can be arrested at any time.	A kowane lokaci ana iya kama ku.
There is a place I want to go back to.	Akwai wurin da nake so in koma.
We did what we could.	Mun yi abin da za mu iya.
We have failed.	Mun sami rashin nasara.
You must feel the pain.	Dole ne ku ji zafi.
Signature sign.	Sa hannu ta alama.
I don't even know where to start with this.	Ban ma san ta inda zan fara da wannan ba.
For us it must have been the last.	A gare mu tabbas ya kasance na ƙarshe.
It comes close to a time.	Ya zo kusa da wani lokaci.
But tell me about you.	Amma gaya mani game da ku.
It does nothing for you.	Ba ya yi maka komai.
We've done it before.	Mun yi shi a baya.
This request was granted.	An ba da wannan buƙatar.
We must now reconsider the project.	Dole ne a yanzu mu sake tunanin aikin.
I felt the need to say something about this.	Na ji bukatar in ce wani abu game da wannan.
I think I do that a lot.	Ina ganin ina yin haka da yawa.
Some money is more than money.	Wasu kuɗi sun fi rashin kuɗi.
I understand it is true.	Na gane yana da gaskiya.
I feel fast.	Ina jin sauri.
I will prove that.	Zan tabbatar da hakan.
I'm always scared.	Ina jin tsoro koyaushe.
Not on that.	Ba a kan wannan ba.
We talked about that.	Mun yi magana game da wannan.
I never made money.	Ban taba samun kudi ba.
Whether you spend a little or a lot.	Ko ka kashe kadan ko mai yawa.
Even if he dies.	Ko da ya mutu.
It's two people.	Mutum biyu ne.
Weeping.	Kuka take.
You are moving fast.	Kuna tafiya da sauri.
And that too is surprising.	Kuma hakan ma abin mamaki ne.
There is nothing to be happy about at first.	Babu wani abu da za a yi farin ciki da farko.
I only enjoy food.	Ina jin daɗin abinci kawai.
We have most of the items in place right now.	Muna da mafi yawan abubuwa a wurin yanzu.
There is no easy way.	Babu hanya mai sauƙi.
I finished.	Na gama.
And that says something.	Kuma wannan yana cewa wani abu.
He does not want to be there anymore.	Ba ya son zama a can kuma.
We will keep that in mind in the future.	Za mu tuna da hakan a gaba.
You told me you did.	Kun ce min kun yi.
You can never imagine what will happen next!	Ba za ku taɓa tunanin abin da ya faru na gaba ba!
I have already broken one marriage.	Na riga na karya aure guda daya.
He will not kill me.	Ba zai kashe ni ba.
It was nice to laugh after the day we did.	Yana da kyau a yi dariya bayan ranar da muka yi.
No one was happy.	Babu wanda ya ji daɗi.
That is what we need.	Abin da muke bukata ke nan.
He will find something useful in them too.	Zai sami wani abu mai amfani a wurin su ma.
That never happened.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
Today is not tomorrow.	Yau ba gobe ba.
I did not do very well.	Ban yi kyau sosai ba.
I am very happy with them.	Ina matukar farin ciki da su.
But there are them.	Amma akwai su.
No one got it.	Babu wanda ya samu.
Sorry to be the one to break it for you.	Yi hakuri da zama wanda zan karya muku shi.
Maybe people are watching us.	Wataƙila mutane suna kallon mu.
He must be fine.	Dole ne ya kasance lafiya.
So do they.	Haka su ma.
We cannot be intelligent.	Ba za mu iya zama masu hankali ba.
You will see how we use it later.	Za ku ga yadda muke amfani da shi daga baya.
Sometimes that works.	Wani lokaci hakan yana aiki.
Later that night and again next.	Daga baya a wannan dare da kuma sake na gaba.
Let him be surprised.	Bari yayi mamaki.
This is a beautiful place like any other.	Wannan wuri ne mai kyau kamar kowane.
I feel empty.	Ina jin ba komai.
She has no reason to lie.	Ba ta da dalilin yin karya.
There is no other way around this.	Babu wata hanya ta kusa da wannan.
Now think about it.	Yanzu ka yi tunanin haka.
It is the best way to do it.	Ita ce hanya mafi kyau don yin ta.
It will happen again when you come back.	Zai sake faruwa idan kun dawo.
I love you all.	Ina son ku duka.
Perhaps this is the most familiar to you.	Wataƙila wannan shine mafi sani a gare ku.
I don't want to make mistakes.	Ba na son yin kuskure.
Not only that, though.	Ba haka kawai ba, ko da yake.
She never wanted to do that.	Ba ta taba son yin haka ba.
They paid well at the time.	Sun biya sosai a lokacin.
We talked a lot.	Mun yi babban magana.
He never took it.	Bai taba dauka ba.
This is interesting, you see.	Wannan yana da ban sha'awa, kun gani.
He should have gone and gone now.	Ya kamata ya tafi ya tafi yanzu.
You want to give it to me, great.	Kuna so ku ba ni, mai girma.
I thought this was where it should be.	Na yi tunanin cewa a nan ne ya kamata ya kasance.
It's about me.	Game da ni ne.
And we don't know why.	Kuma ba mu san dalilin ba.
And that is happening.	Kuma hakan yana faruwa.
They seem to come out of money.	Da alama sun fito daga kudi.
Even if we go ahead.	Ko da za mu ci gaba a gaba.
Life is not always easy to do.	Rayuwa ba ta saba yin haka ba.
You will make a mistake again.	Za ku sake yin kuskure.
Children must learn to walk before they can run.	Dole ne yara su koyi tafiya kafin su iya gudu.
I have to say.	Dole in ce.
I want to talk a little bit about why we are here today.	Ina so in yi magana kadan game da dalilin da ya sa muke nan a yau.
And it is wrong to do it.	Kuma ba daidai ba ne a yi.
This is just a movie.	Wannan fim ne kawai.
That will not happen until next year.	Hakan ba zai faru ba sai shekara mai zuwa.
I can't go ahead with the game.	Ba zan iya yin gaba da wasan ba.
She talked to everyone who passed by.	Ta yi magana da duk wanda suka wuce.
Do not use this yet.	Kar a yi amfani da wannan tukuna.
Nice to go.	Da kyau a tafi.
I’ve seen a lot, in fact.	Na gani da yawa, a gaskiya.
We probably don’t know if it worked for thirty years.	Wataƙila ba mu sani ba ko ya yi aiki har tsawon shekaru talatin.
You can buy anything there.	Kuna iya siyan komai a wurin.
I never killed anything.	Ban taba kashe komai ba.
They can be me.	Za su iya zama ni.
She is already gone.	Ta riga ta tafi.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
He said yes.	Ya ce a yi.
My head felt full.	Kaina ya ji ya cika.
I can see it now, however.	Zan iya gani yanzu, duk da haka.
No errors were shown.	Ba a nuna wani kuskure ba.
It works on.	Yana aiki a kan.
I do not know what is right.	Ban san abin da ke daidai ba.
This is what you are going to do.	Abin da za ku yi ke nan.
She said to me once.	Ta ce da ni sau ɗaya.
This is going to be interesting.	Wannan zai zama mai ban sha'awa.
I don't need that job.	Bana bukatar aikin haka.
I think the time has come.	Ina tsammanin lokaci ya yi.
It's scary.	Abin tsoro ne.
Time stood still for her.	Lokaci ya tsaya mata.
It's not mine.	Ba yin nawa bane.
He saw the world after that.	Ya ga duniya bayan wannan.
He spent most of his time.	Ya yi amfani da mafi yawan lokaci.
It is not so.	Ba haka ba ne.
They are not many.	Ba su da yawa.
Cold again.	Sanyi kuma.
One good print will do.	Buga mai kyau guda ɗaya zai yi.
You can take anyone you want.	Kuna iya ɗaukar duk wanda kuke so.
Everything is fine for her.	Komai yayi mata kyau.
And there is a problem with us.	Kuma akwai matsalar tare da mu.
But he will not do it.	Amma ba zai yi ba.
But if you tell anyone, you know what will happen.	Amma idan ka gaya wa kowa, ka san abin da zai faru.
We certainly do not know much.	Lallai ba mu sani da yawa ba.
We were even.	Mun kasance ko da.
In fact, he never saw it.	A gaskiya ma, bai taba gani ba.
It's bigger, you know.	Ya fi girma, ka sani.
There are many that we do not understand.	Akwai da yawa da ba mu gane ba.
I really don't know what to say anymore.	A gaskiya ban san me zan ce kuma ba.
It's another.	Yana da wani.
He almost brought me back.	Kusa ya dawo da ni.
Even today it seems like it never happened.	Yau ma kamar ba ta taba faruwa ba.
She is coming here.	Tana zuwa nan.
She knew he would not do it.	Ta san hakan ba zai yi ba.
Sometimes, it works.	Wani lokaci, yana aiki.
He does not want to die here.	Ba ya son ya mutu a nan.
It’s hard to work with anything.	Yana da wuya ya yi aiki da wani abu.
I love it, and I continue to love it.	Ina son shi, kuma na ci gaba da son shi.
I do not feel comfortable.	Ban ji dadi ba.
Talk to someone.	Yi magana da wani.
Don't expect too much.	Kada ku yi tsammanin da yawa.
Your best bet must be enough.	Mafi kyawun ku dole ne ya isa sosai.
They decided to continue the project.	Sun yanke shawarar ci gaba da aikin.
They came to work.	Sun zo aiki.
Actually we did not.	A gaskiya ba mu yi ba.
I saved the rest of the next one.	Na ajiye sauran na gaba.
I just learned about it today.	Sai kawai na koyi hakan game da shi yau.
He could not leave it as it was because that would not work.	Ba zai iya barin shi kamar yadda yake ba saboda hakan ba zai yi aiki ba.
He finished drinking.	Ya gama sha.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane .
And your happiness will grow.	Kuma farin cikin ku zai yi girma.
But we do not think so.	Amma ba ma tunanin haka.
We hear amazing things about you.	Muna jin abubuwa masu ban mamaki game da ku.
Otherwise, we have what we have.	In ba haka ba, muna da abin da muke da shi.
She doesn't want to do it again.	Bata son k'ara yi da shi.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu bai yi daidai ba.
She did.	Haka ta yi.
We need to do something.	Muna bukatar mu yi wani abu.
Take the money.	Dauki kuɗin.
Do not break it.	Kar a karya shi.
We must ensure that such a thing never happens again.	Dole ne mu tabbatar da cewa irin wannan abu ba zai sake faruwa ba.
In the morning she fell asleep.	Da safe ta yi barci.
Now we have lost them.	Yanzu mun rasa su.
Children to leave home sometimes.	Yara su bar gida wani lokaci.
It hit me how.	Ya buga min yadda.
He puts it at the same time honestly.	Yana sanya shi a lokacin daya da gaskiya.
It's a good thing.	Abu ne mai kyau.
There are so many interesting things about it.	Akwai abubuwa masu ban sha'awa da yawa game da shi.
But we do not want them to be used.	Amma ba ma so a taɓa amfani da su.
And, finally, remember this.	Kuma, a ƙarshe, tuna wannan.
I never thought he would ever be bigger than me.	Ban yi tsammanin zai taba girma fiye da ni ba.
Obviously, they are not.	Babu shakka, ba haka suke ba.
People see what they expect to see.	Mutane suna ganin abin da suke tsammanin gani.
No one answered the door.	Babu wanda ya amsa kofar.
I did so and she hit.	Na yi haka sai ta buga.
Just sit back and leave life.	Kawai ku zauna ku bar rayuwa.
However, it is a close thing.	Duk da haka, abu ne na kusa.
We give them the tools.	Mu ba su kayan aikin.
And that is happening here.	Kuma hakan yana faruwa a nan.
The truth is a great game.	Gaskiya wasa ne mai girma.
I played with her.	Na yi mata wasa.
It is not.	Ba shi da.
She cries a lot.	Kuka take sosai.
Give it a go.	Ka ba shi tafi.
Items are paid.	An biya abubuwa.
You gave me nothing.	Ba ku ba ni komai.
He is an honest man.	Mutum ne mai gaskiya.
Everyone kind of was.	Kowa irin ya kasance.
They care about us.	Sun damu da mu.
Do not get in the way.	Kar ku shiga hanya.
Every sensible person will.	Duk mai hankali zai.
I hated it.	Na ƙi shi.
It was something new.	Ya kasance sabon abu ne.
Now is the time to act.	Yanzu ne lokacin da za a yi aiki.
Either way, it’s not something that was done.	Ko ta yaya, ba abin da aka yi ba ne.
Another thing is running water.	Wani abu kuma shine ruwan gudu.
Time is moving forward.	Lokaci yana tafiya gaba.
I drive to work almost every day.	Ina tuƙi zuwa aiki kusan kowace rana.
He knew he was there though.	Ya san yana can ko da yake.
This is the first for me.	Wannan shi ne na farko a gare ni.
This route is faster.	Wannan hanya ta fi tafiya.
He ate twice as much.	Ya ci abinci sau biyu kamar da.
True, but there is a way to fix it.	Gaskiya ne, amma akwai hanyar gyara shi.
The story surprised her.	Labarin ya ba ta mamaki.
If he were, he would come to the wrong place.	Idan ya kasance, zai zo wurin da bai dace ba.
I want to succeed today.	Ina so in yi nasara a yau.
But only here.	Amma a nan kawai.
That doesn't look right.	Wannan bai yi kama ba.
We are running fast.	Muna gudu da sauri.
Take care of your thoughts.	Kula da tunanin ku.
One is not very good.	Daya ba shi da kyau sosai.
She's not with us anymore.	Ba ta tare da mu kuma.
He did it several times.	Ya yi sau da yawa.
The truth annoyed me.	Gaskiya ya bata min rai.
Just enjoy it.	Ka ji daɗi kawai.
I think it is bigger now than ever.	Ina tsammanin ya fi girma yanzu fiye da kowane lokaci.
He did it himself.	Shi da kansa ya yi.
We are leaving from here.	Muna tafiya daga nan.
Everyone wants an answer.	Kowa yana son amsa.
Without the time we have.	Ba tare da lokacin da muke da shi ba.
Now is the time.	Yanzu ne lokacin.
No one went out though, just sat there.	Babu wanda ya fita ko da yake, ya zauna a wurin.
Refer to the original article.	Koma ga ainihin labarin.
I passed the place by myself.	Na wuce wurin da kaina.
How long before it started working please.	Yaya tun kafin ya fara aiki don Allah.
All of these are good.	Duk waɗannan suna da kyau.
So she had to get up.	Don haka dole ta tashi.
I can't do anything with it.	Ba zan iya yin komai da shi ba.
I can show you how to find them.	Zan iya nuna muku yadda ake samun su.
He is still here.	Har yanzu yana nan.
But we must be useful.	Amma dole ne mu kasance masu amfani.
Gradually people began to realize this.	A hankali mutane sun fara gane wannan.
You know what happened.	Kun san abin ya faru.
She couldn't care what she thought.	Ta kasa damu da tunanin menene.
I'm sure you will be fine.	Na tabbata za ku kasance lafiya.
They could be the best next year.	Za su iya zama mafi kyau a shekara mai zuwa.
She does not feel well, but there is nothing she can do.	Ba ta ji dadi ba, amma babu abin da za ta iya yi.
She was just as amazing today as she always was.	Ta kasance abin mamaki a yau kamar yadda ta kasance kullum.
This here, here and there.	Wannan a nan, da can da can.
I do not study.	Ba na karatu.
She passed.	Ta wuce.
You can't say anything, you know?	Ba za ku iya cewa komai ba, kun sani?
There are very few people.	Mutane kaɗan ne.
First you cried, then you laughed, and now you cry again.	Kuka na farko, sai dariya, yanzu kuma kuka sake.
You have nothing to fear from us.	Ba ku da wani abin tsoro daga gare mu.
I love them both.	Ina son su duka biyu.
I will be happy to answer.	Zan yi farin cikin ba da amsa.
She can wait.	Tana iya jira.
The sun is down.	Rana ta yi kasa.
It was like night and day.	Ya kasance kamar dare da rana.
The material was awesome.	Kayan ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
This is the moment of truth.	Wannan shi ne, lokacin gaskiya.
They are very fit about such a thing.	Sun dace sosai game da irin wannan abu.
We did not pay for this.	Ba mu biya wannan ba.
What happens if they leave early, if they return early.	Me zai faru idan sun tafi da wuri, idan sun dawo da wuri.
Sorry about that.	Yi hakuri da hakan.
And nothing happened.	Kuma babu abin da ya faru.
So go ahead.	Don haka ku tafi.
I don't care.	Ban damu da shi ba.
Many died.	Da yawa sun mutu.
She could not.	Ba ta iya ba.
With it, you can do whatever you want.	Tare da ita, kuna iya yin yadda kuke so.
I said he was sick, and he was.	Na ce ba shi da lafiya, kuma ya kasance.
And everyone here agrees.	Kuma kowa a nan ya yarda.
I am so glad to have you with us.	Na yi matukar farin cikin samun ku tare da mu.
You do not eat well.	Baka cin abinci sosai.
Probably not always.	Wataƙila ba koyaushe ba.
It will be the best in the world.	Zai zama mafi kyawun duniya.
I can't find her there today.	Ba zan iya samun ta a can yau ba.
It can not be true.	Ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
He wants to go back there.	Yana so ya koma can.
Then the ship.	Sai kuma jirgin.
No, we are together.	A'a, muna tare.
Not exactly what it is about.	Ba ainihin abin da yake game da shi ba.
It's a scary thought.	Tunani ne mai ban tsoro.
I think we can do that.	Ina tsammanin za mu iya yin hakan.
They have to do this though.	Dole ne su yi wannan ko da yake.
Like a fish gone.	Kamar kifi ya tafi.
Please check.	Da fatan za a duba.
People like it.	Mutane sun so shi.
He can't hear them now.	Ya kasa jin su yanzu.
If so, what is the solution?	Idan haka ne, menene hanyar yin wannan.
I understand completely with them and their content.	Na gane gaba ɗaya tare da su da abin da suke ciki.
You never left.	Ba ku taɓa barin ba.
There should be more.	Yakamata a samu wasu da yawa.
I was, of course, unable to get there.	Na kasance, ba shakka, ba zan iya zuwa wurin ba.
I can't believe it.	Ba zan iya yarda da shi ba.
No more, no more.	Babu sauran, babu kuma.
It was planned to be one night.	An shirya zama dare ɗaya.
I am just a child.	Ni yaro ne kawai.
A place where people can be alone.	Wurin da mutane za su iya zama su kaɗai.
No one knows what you want except you.	Ba wanda ya san abin da kuke so sai ku.
It is also true.	Gaskiya ne kuma.
This can be a drinking game, really.	Wannan na iya zama wasan sha, da gaske.
Not us.	Ba mu ba.
There are so many.	Akwai da yawa.
He is said to have later returned there to help her.	An ce daga baya ya koma can don taimaka mata.
Like she knew the future.	Kamar ta san gaba.
Working with us is easy.	Yin aiki tare da mu yana da sauƙi.
The latter wins every time, but only.	Na ƙarshe ya ci nasara kowane lokaci, amma kawai.
When she wanted something done, she wanted it done.	Lokacin da take son a yi abu, sai ta so a yi.
Good so far.	Yayi kyau har zuwa yanzu.
Now the suffering is over.	Yanzu haka wahala ta kare.
I was alone.	Na kasance ni kaɗai.
She says people should be treated fairly.	Ta ce a yi wa mutane daidai.
This is a dog, they said.	Wannan kare ne, in ji su.
It is a sunny day.	Ranar rana ce.
I don't need to play again.	Ban buƙatar sake yin wasa ba.
Finding the place is easy.	Samun wurin yana da sauƙi.
Keeper of God's book.	Mai kula da littafin Allah.
Do it right, and there it is.	Yi daidai, kuma akwai.
Remove from heat.	Cire zafi.
She almost killed you.	Ta kusa kashe ka.
Running is one such thing.	Gudu ɗaya ne irin wannan.
I don’t know if this is growing and developing.	Ban sani ba ko wannan yana girma kuma yana ci gaba.
But it does not work that way.	Amma ba ya aiki ta wannan hanyar.
That is what we should do.	Abin da ya kamata mu yi ke nan.
They move fast.	Suna tafiya da sauri.
They have one person now.	Suna da mutum daya a yanzu.
The plan was well thought out.	An yi tunanin shirin da kyau.
It can be interesting.	Zai iya zama mai ban sha'awa.
But he really died.	Amma ya mutu da gaske.
It is not always necessary to make money.	Ba koyaushe ya zama dole a sami kuɗi ba.
Happiness arose.	Farin ciki ya tashi.
We talked before.	Mun yi magana kafin haka.
This is probably useful for you.	Wannan watakila yana da amfani a gare ku.
It feels hot.	Ya ji ruwan ya yi zafi.
He could pay someone to take care of him.	Ya iya biya wani ya kula da shi.
She started laughing.	Ta fara dariya.
The bus is here tonight.	Yau da dare bas yana nan.
Basically, it is useless.	Ainihin, ba ta da amfani.
She knew the man.	Ta san mutumin.
No lies, no games.	Babu karya, babu wasa.
And she will enjoy it.	Kuma za ta ji daɗin hakan.
This is the problem of the game.	Wannan ita ce matsalar wasan.
We do this every night, not us.	Muna yin haka kowane dare, ba mu ba.
But it is progress.	Amma ci gaba ne.
She told him not to do it again.	Ta ce masa kar ya sake.
The police are gone now.	'Yan sanda sun tafi yanzu.
The game is on tonight.	Wasan ya kasance a daren yau.
You have three.	Kuna da uku.
But today we gave everything.	Amma yau mun ba da komai.
Worry tomorrow.	Ku damu gobe.
They will kill him a lot.	Za su kashe shi da yawa.
Easy repair.	Gyara mai sauƙi.
She felt very good after eating.	Ta ji dadi sosai bayan ta ci abinci.
I will never let that happen again.	Ba zan taɓa barin hakan ya sake faruwa ba.
It feels like we won’t find each other.	Yana ji kamar ba za mu sami juna ba.
Now we are together again.	Yanzu muna tare kuma.
This is mine now.	Wannan shine nawa yanzu.
And there it is.	Kuma akwai shi.
I, too, want to know your experiences.	Ni ma, ina so in san abubuwan da kuka samu a kai.
So, it's not a game.	Don haka, ba wasa ba ne.
However, this does not work for me.	Duk da haka, wannan ba ya aiki a gare ni.
She wanted it, alone.	Ta so shi, shi kadai.
If they just die and go we can move on.	Idan za su mutu kawai su tafi za mu iya ci gaba.
He was scared.	Ya ji tsoro.
It's too cold.	Yana da sanyi sosai.
The house is as beautiful as it gets.	Gidan yayi kyau, yadda take so.
We have that it is.	Muna da cewa shi ne.
They can be very.	Suna iya zama sosai.
You seem to be close to the project.	Da alama kuna kusa da aikin.
Now, open it.	Yanzu, bude shi.
I think this is the real essence of the game.	Ina tsammanin wannan shine ainihin ainihin ainihin ainihin wasan.
But the benefits can be much more than that.	Amma amfani na iya zama da yawa fiye da haka.
He did not want her to do that.	Ba ya so ta yi hakan.
But make sure you get there early, because they sell fast.	Amma ka tabbata ka isa can da wuri, saboda suna sayar da sauri.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
You have to be smart.	Dole ne ku kasance masu hankali.
Sometimes they try strange things.	Wani lokaci sun gwada abubuwan ban mamaki.
He raises her hand.	Ya daga mata hannu.
Even that is not enough.	Ko wannan bai isa ba.
Then go into the movie and watch.	Bayan haka ku shiga cikin fim ɗin ku duba.
Not really in a bad way.	Ba sosai a cikin mummunan hanya.
She wanted to go home.	Ta so ta tafi gida.
Some show the players honestly.	Wasu suna nuna 'yan wasa da gaskiya.
Best of all he didn't tell her, either.	Mafi kyawun abin da bai gaya mata ba, ko ɗaya.
For them, all the work they did paid off.	A gare su, duk aikin da suka yi ya biya.
Can people be allowed to live in such a place?	Shin za a iya barin mutane su zauna a irin wannan wuri?
Now the final thought.	Yanzu tunani na ƙarshe.
Very difficult.	Mai matukar wahala.
I failed you.	Na kasa ku.
Keep trying to take my sleep.	Ci gaba da ƙoƙarin ɗaukar barci na.
And if they can't talk, they go out.	Kuma idan ba za su iya magana ba, sun fita.
And they have never been used.	Kuma ba a taba yin aiki da su ba.
There is nothing that can be done to change that.	Babu wani abu da zai iya yi don canza hakan.
He was seriously injured.	Ya samu mummunan rauni.
I do not know when.	Ban san yaushe ba.
But with or without me, it will happen.	Amma tare da ko ba tare da ni ba, zai faru.
It's very difficult.	Yana da wuya sosai.
Someone stood there.	Wani ya tsaya a wurin.
I do not know what the story is.	Ban san menene labarin ba.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
From what she never got, and now she will never do.	Daga abin da ba ta taba samu ba, kuma yanzu ba za ta taba yi ba.
Some may, but not all.	Wasu na iya, amma ba duka ba.
You’ll be amazed at what’s out there, maybe something you like.	Za ku yi mamakin abin da ke wurin, watakila wani abu da kuke so.
He has to do it himself.	Sai da kansa yake yin haka.
You have been gone for years.	Kun tafi tsawon shekaru.
That doesn't change anything.	Wannan baya canza komai.
But knowledge is not enough.	Amma sanin bai isa ba.
But it is not easy.	Amma ba sauƙi ba.
Who heard that from within.	Wanene ya ji haka daga ciki.
I really hope so.	Ina fatan gaske.
Or not.	Ko babu.
I like watching	Ina son kallon
It's so funny.	Yana da ban dariya sosai.
Early to say, I want to review.	Da wuri don faɗa, ina so in sake duba.
I'm late for work.	Na makara don aiki.
I could not speak to him.	Na kasa yi masa magana.
I hope it helps you, too !.	Ina fatan zai taimake ku, kuma!.
It was easy to do.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi a yi.
I gave it to him.	Na ba shi wannan.
She has never felt better.	Ba ta taba jin lafiya ba.
Whenever it rains, rain falls.	Duk lokacin da aka yi ruwan sama, sai a saka ruwan sama.
She would never trust me.	Ba za ta taba yarda da ni ba.
True or not, it helped me.	A gaskiya ko a'a, ya taimake ni.
She looked familiar.	Ta duba saba.
It's over.	Karshen ya yi.
Maybe he would talk to her.	Wataƙila zai yi magana da ita.
I come back to you.	Na dawo gare ku.
Hopefully she understands.	Da fatan ta gane.
I have to agree.	Dole ne in yarda.
Not exactly right.	Ba daidai yake daidai ba.
I saw it for myself.	Na gani da kaina.
You do not need that.	Ba ku buƙatar hakan.
It's a pleasure.	Abin farin ciki ne.
You can do this at home, people.	Kuna iya yin wannan a gida, mutane.
Probably so.	Wataƙila haka ya kamata.
Drinks to fall.	Abin sha a fada.
She didn't come out right she did like the other kids.	Ba ta fito daidai ba ta yi kamar sauran yara.
Now, go do it.	Yanzu, je yi.
You might think so.	Kuna iya tunanin haka.
Little by little.	Kadan kadan.
It's very comfortable.	Yana da matukar jin dadi.
The same is true of people.	Haka yake da mutane.
That is not necessary.	Hakan bai zama dole ba.
It can only be given.	Ana iya ba da shi kawai.
You will not succeed.	Ba za ku yi nasara ba.
She was able to enlist the help of the police.	Ta iya amfani da taimakon 'yan sanda.
You can even play two games at the same time.	Kuna iya har ma wasa biyu a lokaci guda.
It has not been stopped yet.	Ba a daina ba tukuna.
Where to start with.	A ina za ku fara da su.
I own a house once.	Ina da gida sau ɗaya.
Now they need to run.	A yanzu suna buƙatar gudu.
It is good to meet you.	Yana da kyau mu hadu da ku.
It's fast.	Yana da sauri.
He really doesn't want to touch her.	Da gaske baya son taba ta.
He shows us why.	Ya nuna mana dalilin hakan.
I do not know what happened.	Ban san me ya faru ba.
Things seem to be going well at first.	Da alama abubuwa sun yi kyau da farko.
We may wonder why.	Muna iya mamakin dalilin da ya sa.
We are certainly not in any trouble.	Lallai ba mu kasance cikin wata matsala ba.
This is what you want.	Wannan shine abin da kuke so.
Or just go out.	Ko fita kawai.
I want to be able to use a project like this.	Ina so in sami damar yin amfani da aiki kamar wannan.
It feels like it's coming.	Ji yayi kamar ana zuwa.
I was funny there.	Na kasance mai ban dariya a wurin.
The thought of suicide entered.	Tunanin kashe kansa ya shiga.
And you've heard about it before.	Kuma kun ji labarin wannan a baya.
We can’t help it if we don’t think it through.	Ba za mu taimake ta ba idan ba mu yi tunani ta hanyar.
No one has ever done that before.	Babu wanda ya taɓa yin haka a baya.
He thought about it.	Ya yi tunani a kan haka.
This was of course changed later.	Wannan ba shakka an canza shi daga baya.
But he must die for something.	Amma dole ne ya mutu don wani abu.
She also said nothing.	Ita ma ba ta ce komai ba.
One should know that you will hear.	Ya kamata mutum ya san za ku ji.
He seems to have removed it.	Da alama ya cire shi.
They refused.	Sun ƙi yarda.
I want you to think about tomorrow.	Ina so ku yi tunanin gobe.
There is nothing new here, either.	Babu wani sabon abu a nan, kuma.
You will never succeed.	Ba za ku taɓa yin nasara ba.
She is interested.	Tana da sha'awa.
Time, however, is not lost.	Lokacin, duk da haka, ba a rasa ba.
It is nothing but yourself and what you want to do.	Ba komai sai kanku da abin da kuke son yi.
I can not stop thinking of you.	Ba zan iya daina tunanin ku ba.
There is not much water here.	Babu ruwa da yawa a nan.
But she did not care.	Amma bata damu ba.
Do what you need to do.	Yi abin da kuke buƙatar yi.
Maybe this is the truth, the final answer.	Wataƙila wannan ita ce gaskiya, amsa ta ƙarshe.
You must have understood what she was feeling.	Lallai kun fahimci abin da take ji.
This is one of the few.	Wannan daya ne daga cikin kadan.
Maybe someone should, but you like it better the way it is.	Wataƙila wani ya kamata, amma kuna son shi mafi kyau yadda yake.
It was a wonderful day and you were all great.	Ranar ta kasance mai ban mamaki kuma ku duka kun kasance masu girma.
There is no doubt about that.	Babu shakka game da hakan.
But that did not happen.	Amma hakan bai faru ba.
But it is not unreasonable.	Amma ba rashin hankali ba ne.
These are the things he would say.	Irin abubuwan da zai ce ke nan.
The coffee is weak.	Kofi ya yi rauni.
But we can't let that happen.	Amma ba za mu iya barin abin ya faru ba.
I think this is a game.	Ina jin wannan wasa ne.
Tomorrow do another.	Gobe ​​yi wani.
He can see that.	Yana iya ganin haka.
He is a wonderful man.	Shi mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
They knew it was coming.	Sun san yana zuwa.
That will not be the case.	Ba za a sami hakan ba.
Fortunately, there is an easy way to do this.	Abin farin ciki, akwai hanya mai sauƙi don yin wannan.
He did not answer.	Bai amsa ba.
Not school.	Bata makaranta ba.
I will not wait.	Ba zan jira ba.
How much do you earn per month?	Nawa kuke samu a wata?
Or yes.	Ko kuma a.
Tell me the truth.	Faɗa min gaskiya.
Two of the best.	Biyu daga cikin mafi kyau.
So he is not alone.	Don haka ba shi kadai ba.
No one knows where he is.	Babu wanda ya san inda yake.
It amazes me when it is.	Yana sa ni mamakin lokacin da ya kasance.
They had little time.	Sun sami ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
I remember very well now.	Na tuna da kyau yanzu.
Who will be us.	Wanene zai zama mu.
Certainly not.	Babu shakka ba haka suke ba.
I'm not sure about that.	Ban tabbata akan wannan ba.
Not once but three times.	Ba sau ɗaya ba sau uku.
And nothing even though it grows on its own.	Kuma ba wani abu ko da yake girma da kansa.
There they stopped and looked at each other laughing.	Nan suka tsaya suka kalli juna suna dariya.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
Use "she" if you want to talk about the person.	Yi amfani da "ta" idan kuna son yin magana game da mutum.
It needs someone older.	Yana buƙatar mutumin da ya fi shekaru.
It is all you can do with it.	Shi ne duk abin da za ku iya yi da shi.
There is nothing we can do now.	Babu abin da za mu iya yi a yanzu.

I went out	Na fita
She will never use it again.	Ba za ta sake amfani da shi ba.
She kept giving food.	Ta yi ta ba da abinci.
Now you know why.	Yanzu kun san dalilin.
I love how this makes the skin feel.	Ina son yadda wannan ke sa fata ta ji.
You laugh and talk at the same time.	Kuna dariya da magana lokaci guda.
She was the best.	Ta kasance mafi kyau.
As the second one does.	Kamar yadda na biyu yayi.
I have to stay in place.	Dole ne in tsaya a wuri.
The room is full.	Dakin ya cika.
You touch them.	Kuna taba su.
Life is what you do with it.	Rayuwa ita ce abin da kuke yi da ita.
He was just.	Ya kasance kawai.
He is trying to get me back.	Yana ƙoƙari ya dawo da ni.
We suffered sleep deprivation.	Muka sha wahala barci.
Either way, the truth is the same.	Ko ta yaya, gaskiya daya ce.
No cars in sight.	Babu mota a gani.
I did it for another year.	Na yi shi har wani shekara.
She is a beautiful child.	Tana da kyau yaro.
We no longer feel the same way as we did.	Ba mu ƙara jin juna da irin mu ba.
They had nothing against him, so they released him.	Ba su da komai a kansa, don haka suka sake shi.
I know how you must feel.	Na san yadda dole ne ku ji.
So sad that it is true.	Don haka bakin ciki cewa gaskiya ne.
He wanted the man.	Ya so mutumin.
Immediately everyone stopped.	Nan take kowa ya tsaya.
She went to eat.	Ta je cin abinci.
As expected no.	Kamar yadda aka zata babu.
Let's go home.	Mu tafi gida.
It's over.	Ya gama.
To where always, we do not know.	Zuwa inda ko yaushe, ba mu sani ba.
More is needed immediately.	Akwai buƙatar ƙarin nan take.
This is a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne.
To each other.	Da juna.
I like that too.	Ina son hakan kuma.
That's the way it is.	Haka abin yake.
I can't remove it.	Ba zan iya cire shi ba.
As a result, they are more common today.	Saboda haka, sun fi yawa a yau.
He should not be surprised.	Bai kamata yayi mamaki ba.
Had she traveled to the end of the world for him.	Da ta yi tafiya har karshen duniya a gare shi.
We will get some help or something.	Za mu sami ɗan taimako ko wani abu.
Go into the house and find something to eat.	Ku shiga gidan, ku sami abin da za ku ci.
They can’t get anyone to play anymore.	Ba za su iya samun kowa ya ƙara yin wasa ba.
They can't have one.	Ba za su iya samun daya ba.
This is fear, or fear.	Wannan jin tsoro, ko tsoro.
Pass it this way.	Wuce ta wannan hanya ce.
The police were called.	Sai aka kira 'yan sanda.
She felt comfortable.	Ta ji dadi.
Whatever you want.	Duk yadda kuke so.
Nothing happened.	Babu wani abu da ya faru.
No, not laughing.	A'a, ba dariya.
Everyone treats me well.	Kowa yayi min kyau.
But he still could not believe it.	Amma har yanzu bai iya yarda da hakan ba.
But, say you want more.	Amma, ka ce kuna son ƙarin.
Don't make me add anything.	Kar ka sa na kara cewa komai.
What they say.	Abin da suke cewa.
It is difficult to take.	Yana da wuya a ɗauka.
I think you make the world go away.	Ina tsammanin kuna sa duniya ta tafi.
I saw the truth.	Na ga gaskiya.
The work should be done only once.	Ya kamata a yi aikin sau ɗaya kawai.
He did not want to go.	Bata so ya tafi ba.
To get a lot, but still a little.	Don samun da yawa, amma duk da haka kadan.
I really feel people haven’t thought of that yet.	Ina jin da gaske mutane ba su yi tunanin hakan ba tukuna.
They wanted to kill everyone in the world.	Sun so su kashe kowa a duniya.
You will get mine.	Za ku samu nawa.
Why is he so afraid?	Me yasa yake jin tsoro haka?
Apply it sometimes.	Sanya shi wani lokaci.
Another good time.	Wani lokaci mai kyau.
It's something to stop.	Wani abu ne a daina.
I'm not surprised you said no.	Ban yi mamakin cewa ka ce a'a ba.
Now, everything is clear.	Yanzu, komai ya bayyana.
Maybe even before that time.	Watakila ma kafin lokacin.
It will crash.	Zai yi karo.
All she knew was that she talked to him.	Abin da ta sani kawai sai ta yi masa magana.
Maybe he refuses.	Wataƙila ya ƙi.
I don't want this for you.	Ban so wannan a gare ku ba.
He will be here over the weekend.	Zai kasance a nan a karshen mako.
I waited for him to come home.	Na jira ya zo gida.
You will be amazed at how well it can work !.	Za ku yi mamakin yadda zai iya aiki sosai!.
If not, buy a used car.	Idan ba haka ba, saya mota da aka yi amfani da ita.
I'm very tired.	Na gaji sosai.
You will have a bad time.	Za ku yi mummunan lokaci.
It is the reason we can do that.	Ita ce dalilin da za mu iya yin hakan.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu ya faru.
I know you want to surprise her tonight.	Na san kuna son ba ta mamaki a daren nan.
If you really want to, you will.	Idan da gaske kuke so, za ku yi.
A little surprising, really.	Abin mamaki kaɗan, da gaske.
I assure you we did not.	Ina tabbatar muku ba mu yi ba.
And the money is also good.	Kuma kudi ma yana da kyau.
We stopped to eat.	Muka tsaya ci abinci.
Everyone should have equal access.	Ya kamata kowa ya sami dama daidai.
We look forward to hearing from you.	Muna sha'awar samun taimakon ku.
Do you prefer swimming or seeing things?	Shin kun fi son yin iyo ko ganin abubuwan gani?
They live with each other.	Zaune suke da juna.
It will no longer exist.	Ba zai ƙara zama ba.
I think you will go.	Ina tsammanin za ku tafi.
He began to pick them up himself.	Ya fara ɗaukar su ma da kansa.
It feels good.	Yana da kyau ji.
As he did.	Kamar yadda ya yi.
We got up early to catch the train.	Mun tashi da wuri don kama jirgin.
It is only what life calls us to do.	Abin da rayuwa ta kira mu ne kawai.
Good job on that !.	Kyakkyawan aiki akan wannan!.
We can do many things, if we have a lot of money.	Za mu iya yin abubuwa da yawa, idan muna da kuɗi da yawa.
I just came to say.	Na zo in ce kawai.
So nothing can be done.	Don haka ba za a iya komai ba.
This material is just amazing.	Wannan kayan yana da ban mamaki kawai.
Can I take it to the bus station?	Za a iya kai ni tashar bas?
The killer was never arrested.	Ba a taba kama wanda ya kashe shi ba.
He thought it would look like.	Ya yi tunanin zai yi kama.
He was, of course, more than that.	Ya kasance, ba shakka, fiye da haka.
Maybe she even died.	Watakila ma ta mutu.
I live nearby.	Ina zaune kusa.
But this cannot be understood by thinking about it.	Amma ba za a iya gane hakan ta hanyar yin tunani a kai ba.
I can always sleep at the end.	Kullum zan iya yin barci a ƙarshe.
It's on call.	Yana kan kira.
Do not be afraid to refuse.	Kada ku ji tsoron ƙi.
And so on.	Kuma haka.

After that it continued.	Bayan haka aka ci gaba.
In all, you have come by hand.	A cikin duka, kun zo da hannu.
You should not be outside.	Ba kamata ku kasance a waje ba.
When we sleep we do not eat.	Idan muna barci ba mu ci abinci ba.
Start now.	Fara yanzu.
He was home and always will be.	Ya kasance gida kuma koyaushe zai kasance.
Maybe it was for everyone.	Wataƙila ya kasance ga kowa.
That's amazing.	Abin mamaki kenan.
Even in the afternoon.	Ko da rana.
He broke one by one.	Ya yi karya daya bayan daya.
Without killing others.	Ba tare da kashe wasu ba.
I think he can give me the job.	Ina jin zai iya ba ni aikin.
But he will get tired quickly.	Amma zai gaji da sauri.
So, get out.	Don haka, fita.
I know myself better than anyone knows me.	Na san kaina fiye da kowa ya san ni.
I did not speak to him or confront him.	Ban yi masa magana ko gaba da shi ba.
It could not be better.	Ba zai iya zama mafi kyau ba.
Like a big brother.	Kamar babban yaya.
That was the only reason he was killed.	Wannan shi ne kawai dalilin da ya sa aka kashe shi.
It is their job, not mine.	Aikin su ne ba nawa ba.
Almost all of us.	Kusan mu duka.
If they are killed, they are killed.	Idan an kashe su, an kashe su.
Come on in, take a look.	Ku zo, kuna iya ɗaukar wannan.
This is the kind of thing that keeps us out of there.	Wannan shi ne irin abin da ya sa mu daga wurin.
After she returned she sat down.	Bayan ta koma ta zauna.
You have to come out.	Dole ne ku fito.
Not twice a day.	Ba sau biyu a rana ɗaya ba.
Therefore, this does not happen.	Saboda haka, wannan ba ya faruwa.
But never like that.	Amma kar a taɓa son wannan.
But it is only true if you want it to be.	Amma gaskiya ne kawai idan kuna so ya kasance.

She drank coffee.	Kofi ta sha.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu ya faru.
Almost everything is closed.	Kusan komai ya rufe.
Now she knows better.	Yanzu ta fi sani.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
He went ahead, which is where they had to go.	Ya tafi zuwa gaba, wanda shine inda dole ne su je.
No one knows what to say next.	Ba wanda ya san abin da zai ce a gaba.
Or something you can think of.	Ko wani abu da za ku iya tunani.

She had heard before.	Ta ji a baya.
I know that really is nothing.	Na san cewa da gaske ba komai ba ne.
This works well.	Wannan yana aiki da kyau.
He hoped she would not give up.	Ya yi fatan ba za ta bari ba.
That's one of my toys.	Daya daga cikin kayan wasa na kenan.
It's time to dump her.	Lokacin aiki ya yi.
Something told me she was pregnant.	Wani abu ya gaya min tana ciki.
I get everything right away.	Na samun komai a take.
They had a wonderful marriage.	Sun yi aure mai dadi.
Everything is going well.	Komai yana tafiya daidai.

You have probably done this before.	Tabbas kun yi wannan a baya.

Some of these things later became a reality.	Wasu daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan daga baya sun zama gaskiya.
So let's go.	Don haka bari a tafi.
I do not feel we spent the night there.	Bana jin mun kwana a can.
Let her sit.	Bar ta ta zauna.
But nothing has changed.	Amma babu abin da ya canza.

I'm a little interested in that, too.	Ina dan sha'awar hakan, kuma.
But no such thing was found.	Amma ba a sami irin wannan ba.

There is no fix for this yet, but the problem is understood now.	Babu gyara ga wannan har yanzu, amma an fahimci matsalar yanzu.

If so, everyone would do it.	Idan haka ne, da kowa zai yi.
He does not use it.	Ba ya amfani da shi.
Now for the next.	Yanzu don gaba.

They will not be there.	Ba za su kasance a wurin ba.
I asked him what he wanted.	Na tambaye shi me yake so.
It was the stay that made them buy.	Zama ne ya sa su saya.
Now we know why.	Yanzu mun san dalilin.

He has to go do it now.	Dole ne ya tafi yin hakan a yanzu.
I usually take three of them at a time.	Kullum ina kai su uku a lokaci guda.

Something similar is happening.	Irin wannan abu yana faruwa.
He did not know where he came from.	Bai san daga ina ya fito ba.

However, he refused to do it himself.	Duk da haka, ya ƙi yin kansa.

Turn off the heat.	Kashe zafi.
The car started moving forward.	Motar ta fara tafiya gaba.
I would have stayed with him.	Da na zauna da shi.
But he wanted to know more.	Amma ya so ya kara sani.
Maybe that's why she came back.	Watakila shi yasa ta dawo.
It could be a mistake.	Yana iya zama kuskure.
People seem to want more than they need.	Mutane da alama suna so fiye da yadda suke bukata.
This may be safe, it may not be so.	Wannan yana iya zama lafiya, yana iya zama ba haka ba.
He was once again a successful, hardworking and hardworking man.	Ya sake zama mutum mai nasara, mai aiki da aiki.
I do not hear.	Ba na ji.
But that came back to haunt him.	Amma wannan ya dawo karya.
We did not succeed that way.	Ba mu yi nasara haka ba.
And nothing could be further from the truth.	Kuma babu abin da ya fi tabbata.
They spent the weekend at the beach.	Sun yi karshen mako a bakin ruwa.
I want to check though.	Ina son ya duba ko.
They killed the one who beat her.	Sun kashe wanda ya yi mata duka.
The water was delicious!	Ruwan ya yi dadi!
Food is available if you would like, please get it.	Akwai abinci idan kuna so, don Allah a samu.
I tell you.	Ina gaya muku.
He wished her well.	Ya so ta lafiya.
That's why one corrects.	Shi yasa mutum ya gyara.
So the police don't even come.	Don haka ’yan sanda ma ba sa zuwa.
He loved it and couldn't wait to go again.	Ya so shi kuma ya kasa jira ya sake tafiya.
It is explained.	An bayyana.
It makes you think.	Ya sa ka yi tunani.
He thought I didn't care.	Ya yi tunanin rashin ko in kula.
After that, this goes to sleep.	Bayan haka, wannan yana tafiya barci.
Or maybe not everyone knows that.	Ko watakila kowa bai san haka ba.
I like that once in a while.	Ina son hakan sau ɗaya a ɗan lokaci.
She wanted to ask him, but she knew she couldn't talk.	Ta so ta tambaye shi, amma ta san ba za ta iya magana ba.
Some could not do this.	Wasu ba su iya yin wannan ba.
My boat came with one and it was nice to have.	Jirgin ruwa na ya zo da daya kuma yana da kyau a samu.
Of course something went wrong.	Tabbas wani abu yayi kuskure.
Be on top of it.	Ku kasance a kan shi.
She never found out.	Ba ta taba gano komai ba.
The gynecologist is busy in the morning.	Likitan mata yana da aiki da safe.
Everyone knows everything.	Kowa ya san komai.
There is no right or wrong.	Babu daidai ko kuskure.
It is good to do so.	Yayi kyau yayi haka.
We took three home with us.	Muka kai guda uku gida tare da mu.
You are making progress.	Kuna samun ci gaba.
In fact, we need something in general.	A gaskiya ma, muna buƙatar wani abu na gaba ɗaya.
It just shows that you are doing something right.	Kawai yana nuna kuna yin wani abu daidai.
They are tired of waiting for the train.	Sun gaji da jiran jirgin.
Sometimes however it was a little cold.	Wani lokaci duk da haka ya ɗan yi sanyi.
I am tired of hearing them.	Na gaji da jin su.
People do not fail to surprise.	Mutane ba sa kasa yin mamaki.
And of course, yes.	Kuma ba shakka, haka ne.
Not much has changed.	Ba da yawa ya canza.
It is something we want to do.	Abu ne da muke so mu yi.
They feel so good.	Suna jin dadi sosai.
What happened once will happen again.	Abin da ya faru sau ɗaya zai sake faruwa.
I do not want you to find out.	Ban so ku gano haka ba.
If he goes out.	Idan ya fita.
Let's talk together once.	Bari mu yi magana tare sau ɗaya.
However progress has been slow.	Duk da haka ci gaba ya kasance a hankali.
But there is nothing you can do.	Amma babu wani abu da za ku iya yi.
The school is out.	Makaranta ya fita.
And it has to be right for me.	Kuma dole ne ya zama daidai na.
Of course it will.	Tabbas zai yi.
It was a good day.	Ta kasance mai kyau rana.
I'm afraid to go out.	Ina tsoron fita.
Things are still going on.	Har yanzu abubuwan suna ci gaba da faruwa.
I’ve never seen it work, not here, somehow.	Ban taba ganin yana aiki ba, ba a nan ba, ko ta yaya.
I was the only one.	Ni kadai ke nan.
Do you feel comfortable.	Kuna jin dadi.
But something happened to me.	Amma wani abu ya faru da ni.
No mistake, she certainly is.	Babu kuskure, tabbas ita ce.
But it's funny.	Amma yana da ban dariya.
No casualties have been reported so far.	Har yanzu babu wanda ake ganin ya mutu.
We will not do it.	Ba za mu yi shi ba.
But, this does.	Amma, wannan yana yi.
I know you will come back.	Na san za ku dawo.
It makes the game easier.	Ya sa wasan ya zama mai sauƙi.
It's just a matter of time.	Lokaci ne kawai.
But then it just came to me.	Amma sai kawai ya zo mini.
She sees these being used more and more.	Ta ga ana ƙara amfani da waɗannan.
It has changed the way many people think.	Ya canza yadda mutane da yawa suke tunani.
That can't happen.	Wannan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
I was never sure what to say about her.	Ban taba tabbatar da abin da zan kara cewa game da ita ba.
Where it should be safe.	Inda ya kamata ya kasance lafiya.
You will work here, so you will see for yourself.	Za ku yi aiki a nan, don haka za ku gani da kanku.
You feel like the real thing.	Kuna jin kamar ainihin abu.
We still have a feeling.	Har yanzu muna da ji.
He has a home there.	Yana da gida a can.
He knows everything he needs to know.	Ya san duk abin da yake bukata ya sani.
Apparently, she has nothing else to do.	Da alama, ba ta da sauran abin da za ta yi.
I felt like a child again.	Na sake ji kamar yaro.
After that, we got cold.	Bayan haka, mun sami sanyi.
She opened the door.	Ta bude kofar.
You can’t go wrong when you do.	Ba za a iya yin kuskure ba lokacin da kuke yi.
I said, not really.	Na ce, ba sosai ba.
Go ahead.	Ku ci gaba.
Learn the easy way.	Koyi hanya mai sauƙi.
There is no child I have to deal with.	Babu wani yaro da zan yi da shi.
We can get up in the morning.	Za mu iya tashi da safe.
When it rains it does well.	Idan aka yi ruwan sama abin ya yi kyau.
It will take a while to get up.	Zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci kaɗan don tashi.
Apparently, the work stopped.	Da alama, sai aikin ya tsaya.
This person will not understand what we are doing.	Wannan mutumin ba zai fahimci abin da muke yi ba.
Maybe a little slower.	Wataƙila a ɗan hankali.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
You have to stay.	Dole ku zauna.
Everyone wants to do their best.	Kowa yana so ya yi mafi kyau.
I think there are some good things.	Ina tsammanin akwai wasu abubuwa masu kyau.
And he does.	Kuma haka yake yi.
It will show that you are right.	Zai bayyana cewa kana da gaskiya.
I have to do well.	Dole ne in yi kyau.
But we stopped.	Amma mun tsaya.
I feel so good that he knows this.	Ina ji sosai cewa ya san wannan.
I know better now.	Na fi sani yanzu.
You're dead!	Ka mutu!
And not you.	Kuma ba ku.
So, the right time to start something is now.	Don haka, lokacin da ya dace don fara wani abu shine yanzu.
That never happened.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
I have no doubt.	Ba na shakka.
You are very tasty.	Kuna da dadi sosai.
He was very happy with this look.	Yayi matukar farin ciki da wannan kallon.
People don't care.	Mutane ba su damu da haka ba.
So good for you !!.	Don haka yayi muku kyau!!.
The work is not over.	Aikin bai wuce ba.
I love what you do.	Ina son abin da kuke yi.
First, yes.	Na farko, a .
If you feel pain, stop immediately.	Idan kun ji zafi, tsaya nan da nan.
The drink is gone.	Abin sha ya tafi.
All but one.	Duk sai daya.
Say no.	Ka ce a'a.
I can't believe it.	Ba zan iya yarda da shi ba.
Do not be afraid to test them before proceeding.	Kar ku ji tsoron gwada su kafin ci gaba.
And it looks really good.	Kuma yayi kyau sosai.
I do not know where they went.	Ban san inda suka je ba.
This house is in dire need of renovation.	Wannan gidan yana buƙatar gyara sosai.
And we paid.	Kuma mun biya.
She knew she could.	Ta san za ta iya.
Only such a person.	Irin wannan mutumin ne kawai.
But then he left.	Amma sai ya tafi.
I read this book in one go.	Na karanta wannan littafin a tafi guda.
I have so much to tell you.	Ina da abubuwa da yawa da zan gaya muku.
We got up early in the morning.	Da safe muka tashi da wuri.
That would not be good.	Hakan ba zai yi kyau ba.
The project was a success.	Aikin ya yi nasara.
So it feels like it will be interesting.	Don haka yana jin kamar zai zama mai ban sha'awa.
Look, it's just hard.	Duba, yana da wahala kawai.
He started to get up.	Ya fara tashi.
Later, he told himself.	Daga baya, ya gaya wa kansa.
It can be described as follows.	Ana iya bayyana shi kamar haka.
You can have something else if you want.	Kuna iya samun wani abu kuma idan kuna so.
I can no longer take this!	Ba zan iya ƙara ɗaukar wannan ba!
But really what to say.	Amma da gaske me za su ce.
Somehow, the women lost.	Ko ta yaya, mata sun rasa.
You drink.	Kuna sha.
Or it should be.	Ko kuma ya kamata.
But the truthful do.	Amma masu gaskiya suna yi.
This is the feeling.	Wannan shi ne ji.
Working time is now.	Lokacin aiki shine yanzu.
I can not wait.	Ba zan iya jira ba.
I will never sleep.	Ba zan taɓa yin barci ba.
It is better to cover.	Yayi kyau ka rufe.
You see I grew up.	Kun ga na girma.
Before you continue, look at the moon.	Kafin ka ci gaba, kalli wata.
He got a chance.	Ya samu damar.
Come on in, take a look.	Ku shiga ku duba.
They are on their way.	Suna kan hanya.
This is not entirely my knowledge.	Wannan ba gaba ɗaya ba ne na sani.
Or somewhere.	Ko wani wuri.
We have good players.	Muna da ’yan wasa masu kyau.
Like now, here with you.	Kamar yanzu, nan tare da ku.
I think we did a really good job.	Ina tsammanin mun yi aiki mai kyau sosai.
It's very exciting.	Abin farin ciki ne sosai.
Then it's time.	Sai lokacin sa.
I will enjoy it.	Zan ji daɗi da shi.
I call to you, but you do not hear me.	Ina kira gare ku, amma ba ku ji ni ba.
Now, you must be able to play the game.	Yanzu, dole ne ku iya kunna wasan.
I make coffee for a living.	Ina yin kofi don rayuwa.
She went out and left the door open.	Ta fita ta bar kofar a bude.
Do not save this.	Kar a ajiye wannan.
You will go out.	Za ku fita.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
That's the end of the story.	Karshen labarin kenan.
I like both.	Na so duka.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba haka abin yake ba.
This is a great help.	Wannan babban taimako ne.
And there is something about her too.	Kuma akwai wani abu game da ita ma.
If you can not get in.	Idan ba za ku iya samun a.
It looks good now.	Ya fita da kyau yanzu.
You have a lot of time left.	Kuna da sauran lokaci mai yawa.
She is beautiful.	Tana da kyau.
The house is closed.	An rufe gidan.
I think you can not do that.	Ina tsammanin ba za ku iya yin hakan ba.
Walk at night.	Tafiya cikin dare.
I never got well again.	Ban sake samun lafiya ba.
He is talking to me.	Yana cikin magana da ni.
We want to touch.	Muna so mu taba.
And you didn't tell me to go back.	Kuma ba ku ce in koma ba.
Keep it for a week.	A ajiye shi har tsawon mako guda.
So no wonder why we lost.	Don haka ba mamaki dalilin da ya sa muka rasa.
It is the way of the world now.	Hanyar duniya ce yanzu.
The first is the location.	Na farko shine wuri.
Of course, if something unexpected happens.	Tabbas, idan abin da ba a zata ya faru.
And he heard it again.	Kuma ya sake ji.
Even when there was a problem the work was never done right.	Ko da lokacin da aka sami matsala aikin ba a taɓa yin daidai ba.
I love how it turns out.	Ina son yadda ya fita.
I did not kill him.	Ban kashe shi ba.
That doesn't matter now.	Hakan ba komai yanzu.
You look scary.	Ka ga ban tsoro.
It's a big job.	Babban aiki ne.
I have to go now.	Dole ne in tafi yanzu.
Maybe you see something like this.	Wataƙila ka ga irin wannan.
Only water now.	Ruwa ne kawai yanzu.
I caught some.	Na kama wasu.
Finally, he covered them.	A ƙarshe, ya rufe su.
Probably too much.	Wataƙila da yawa.
There are others.	Akwai wasu.
The house is full of beauty.	Gidan ya cika da kyau.
People are working.	Mutane suna aiki.
I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested.	Ina ba da shawarar shi ga kowa da kowa da ke da sha'awa.
I will do it again.	Zan sake yi.
They too have children to care for.	Su ma suna da ’ya’ya da za su kula da su.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane.
I'm sure it will last a long time.	Na tabbata zai yi tsawon rai.
Even so.	Ko da hakan.
I do not know anything.	Ban san komai ba.
Of course, we wouldn’t mind if you looked, you would say.	Tabbas, ba za mu damu ba idan kun duba, za ku ce.
This made it a little harder for him.	Hakan ya sa ya ɗan ƙara wahala.
I know from there we will get in trouble.	Na san daga nan za mu sami matsala.
And she loves it.	Kuma tana son shi.
These are the best.	Waɗannan su ne mafi kyau.
We want to go play after game.	Muna so mu tafi wasa bayan wasa.
We died for that.	Mun mutu akan haka.
We would be better off without it.	Za mu fi kyau idan ba tare da shi ba.
He likes what the doctor says.	Yana son abin da likitan ke cewa.
Some were optimistic, and some were very skeptical.	Wasu sun kasance masu kyakkyawan fata, wasu kuma sun kasance masu rashin tunani sosai.
Two people may be injured.	Mutane biyu na iya samun rauni.
He will be back home next week.	Zai dawo gida mako mai zuwa.
Obviously, he too could not eat.	Babu shakka, shi ma ba zai iya ci ba.
Tell him to be there by twelve o'clock tomorrow afternoon.	Ka gaya masa ya kasance a wurin da karfe sha biyu na rana gobe.
I need to get out of here.	Ina bukata in fita daga nan.
And when we got home, it was amazing to say the least.	Kuma da muka dawo gida, abin mamaki ne a ce ko kadan.
He does not feel that way about many people.	Ba ya jin haka game da mutane da yawa.
I want to kill her.	Ina so in kashe ta.
But as usual, things did not go as planned.	Amma kamar yadda aka saba, abubuwa ba sa tafiya yadda ya kamata.
Just find out.	Kawai gano.
He does not even know for sure, it is not enough to be sure.	Bai ma san da gaske ba, bai isa ya tabbata ba.
He wants to take care of others.	Yana son kula da wasu.
That would be nice.	Da yayi kyau.
Now it is not available.	Yanzu ba a iya samun shi.
Or he knows it.	Ko kuma ya san shi.
I don’t believe we do it because it’s easy.	Ban yarda cewa muna yin shi ba saboda yana da sauƙi.
Let's see how we can do that.	Bari mu ga yadda za mu yi da wannan tukuna.
I made dinner.	Na yi abincin dare.
She didn't hear it, either, she did.	Ba ta ji shi ba, shi ma, ita.
Tell them so, somehow.	Ka ce su haka, ko ta yaya.
We are traveling.	Muna tafiya.
This is the best feeling.	Wannan shine mafi kyawun ji.
And it really is.	Kuma da gaske yake.
I can't prove it to myself.	Ba zan iya tabbatar wa kaina ba.
There are so many.	Akwai da yawa da yawa.
He will definitely read well.	Tabbas tabbas zai yi karatu mai kyau.
There seems to be a lot we don't know about it.	Da alama akwai abubuwa da yawa da ba mu sani ba game da shi.
I never wanted to get married.	Ban taba son yin aure ba.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba haka abin yake ba.
First, is the one you show.	Na farko, shine wanda kuka nuna.
It was something he could never do.	Abu ne da ba zai taba iya yi ba.
He knew nothing about everything.	Bai san komai ba game da komai.
No, no.	A'a, babu.
This work must be completed by tomorrow.	Dole ne a gama wannan aikin zuwa gobe.
They will be easy.	Za su kasance da sauƙi.
When we did.	Da muka yi.
I can't take things from the user.	Ba zan iya ɗaukar abubuwa daga mai amfani ba.
The person who works.	Mutumin da yake aiki.
But speeding is not easy.	Amma yin sauri ba shi da sauƙi.
The plane was about to take off.	Da jirgin da ya kusa tashi.
She was with them.	Ta kasance tare da su.
I spoke to him again today.	Na sake yi masa magana yau.
Although it was never done.	Ko da yake ba a yi wani lokaci ba.
But it seems to be a difficult thing to do.	Amma da alama abu ne mai wahala a yi.
This is moving forward.	Wannan yana tafiya gaba.
I know we have a lot going on.	Na san muna da abubuwa da yawa da ke faruwa.
Not a place.	Ba wuri ba.
Too much, man.	Ya yi yawa, mutum.
And in the morning they left.	Kuma da safe suka tafi.
I am going to school.	Ina zuwa makaranta.
And now, come here.	Kuma yanzu, zo nan.
I do not know why exactly.	Ban san dalilin da yasa daidai ba.
One on one.	Daya a kan daya.
But first.	Amma da farko.
My favorite.	Abin da na fi so.
And it was a joy.	Kuma ya zama abin farin ciki.
I can't sleep.	Ba zan iya barci ba.
It is a beautiful home.	Wani kyakkyawan gida ne.
He spent the night finishing the work.	Ya kwana ya gama aikin.
Please, no.	Don Allah, a'a.
Nothing has changed.	Babu wani abu da ya canza.
You know what will happen.	Kun san abin da zai faru.
Knowledge required.	Ana buƙatar sani.
Others go when they are full.	Wasu kuma idan sun cika sai su tafi.
You should always take the money if it is given to someone else.	Koyaushe yakamata ku ɗauki kuɗin idan an ba da wani.
She closed the car door.	Ta rufe kofar motar.
It should be interesting.	Ya kamata ya zama mai ban sha'awa.
Then he spent the night inside.	Sai ya kwana a ciki.
He did not call anyone.	Bai kira kowa ba.
I also like to travel by plane.	Ni ma, ina so in yi tafiya da jirgin sama.
Go and tell someone and get the person involved.	Ka je ka gaya wa wani ka sa mutumin ya shiga ciki.
Check it out here !.	Duba shi a nan!.
Loss of attention gradually.	Rasa hankali a hankali.
This happens sometimes.	Wannan yana faruwa wani lokaci.
I do not want to be unaware of what to expect.	Ba na son rashin sanin abin da zan jira.
She loves it so much.	Tana son shi sosai.
That made her remember something.	Hakan yasa ta tuna wani abu.
Or in the past.	Ko a baya.
Hopefully there will be an attempt to keep going.	Da fatan za a yi ƙoƙarin ci gaba da tafiya.
I don't make much money.	Ba na samun kuɗi da yawa.
All we can do is laugh.	Duk abin da za mu iya yi shi ne dariya.
He didn't care about anything.	Bai kula da komai ba.
He said he was disappointed.	Yace hakan ya bata masa rai.
Focus on something you can get.	Mai da hankali kan wani abu da za ku iya samu.
She can't take this much.	Ba za ta iya ɗaukar wannan abu da yawa ba.
They are very large.	Suna da girma sosai.
I can't add more debt.	Ba zan iya kara bashi bashi ba.
Get there early.	Ku isa can da wuri.
They could not see that what they were doing was wrong.	Ba su iya ganin cewa abin da suka yi ba daidai ba ne.
Then everything happened at the same time.	Sai komai ya faru a lokaci guda.
No meal time.	Babu lokacin cin abinci.
It's over.	Ya wuce.
Just that was a bad time for me.	Kawai cewa ya kasance mummunan lokaci a gare ni.
Think about when he will get it.	Ka yi tunanin lokacin da zai samu.
They will continue to talk about it for many years to come.	Za su ci gaba da yin magana game da shi shekaru da yawa masu zuwa.
He wanted to do more than that.	Ya so ya yi fiye da haka.
Yet it is better to remember something that happened.	Amma duk da haka ya fi kyau ya tuna wani abin da ya faru.
He’s one of me trying to help me.	Yana daga cikin ni da ke ƙoƙarin taimaka mani.
It turns back on.	Yana kunna baya.
And he is a lover.	Kuma shi mai son shi ne.
But there is no way to be honest.	Amma babu yadda za a yi gaskiya.
You weren’t surprised or anything.	Kai bai yi mamaki ko wani abu ba.
An na.	An na.
Not the day.	Ba ranar ba.
Are you old enough to buy this drink?	Shin kun isa siyan wannan abin sha?
I have to go to the back door.	Dole na je kofar baya.
And it should.	Kuma ya kamata.
But it feels like it will end.	Amma yana jin kamar zai ƙarshe.
In less than three years.	Cikin kasa da shekaru uku.
We must decide what to do with it.	Dole ne mu yanke shawarar abin da za mu yi da shi.
It is still being read today.	Har yanzu ana ci gaba da karatu a yau.
We are on our way.	Muna kan hanya.
We got nothing.	Ba mu sami komai ba.
So you can't go wrong.	Don haka ba za ku iya yin kuskure ba.
Here is the article.	Ga labarin.
Maybe we don't even care.	Wataƙila mu ma ba mu damu ba.
Take the latter.	Ka dauka na karshen.
I'm sure you enjoyed the ride.	Na tabbata kuna jin daɗin tafiya.
Whatever comes to you is not good.	Duk abin da ya zo muku, ba shi da kyau.
No one expected.	Babu wanda ya zata.
All of these were surprisingly good.	Duk waɗannan sun kasance abin mamaki mai kyau.
The meeting was a success.	Taron ya samu nasara.
It's very uncomfortable.	Yana da matukar rashin jin daɗi.
But you would never meet her.	Amma da ba za ku hadu da ita ba.
I can’t think you’ll enjoy it here.	Ba zan iya tunanin za ku ji daɗi a nan ba.
You can come here.	Kuna iya zuwa nan.
He knew it would be difficult for him to do so.	Ya san zai yi masa wuya ya yi hakan.
This is not the end of this journey.	Wannan ba shine karshen wannan tafiya ba.
It's just school.	Makaranta ce kawai.
Together, we can make that happen.	Tare, za mu iya sa hakan ta faru.
They know that no one should take what he has.	Sun san kada kowa ya dauki abin da yake da shi.
I am very tired.	Na gaji sosai.
But today that surprised me.	Amma yau abin ya bani mamaki.
And she talked to you a lot.	Kuma ta yi magana da ku sosai.
I will write about it if I am asked.	Zan rubuta game da shi idan an tambaye ni.
Both are required.	Duka ana bukata.
Every hand on my head.	Kowane hannu a kaina.
To hear them personally.	Don jin su da kansa.
So far, there has been a lot of progress.	Ya zuwa yanzu, an sami ci gaba da dama.
You made me human.	Kun sanya ni mutum.
Like he didn't hear or hear.	Kamar bai ji ko ji ba.
And here is the most interesting thing.	Kuma a nan shi ne abu mafi ban sha'awa.
You should be able to try whatever you want.	Ya kamata ku iya gwada duk abin da kuke so.
She hit a hot iron.	Ta buga k'arfe mai zafi.
Need help with this.	Bukatar taimako da wannan.
It’s a great place to work.	Wuri ne mai kyau don yin aiki.
It all happens.	Duk yana faruwa.
They were really, really hard.	Sun kasance da gaske, da wahala sosai.
I wrote to her.	Na rubuta mata.
It seems too.	Da alama ma.
She has to get out.	Dole ta fita.
There must be someone else.	Dole ne a sami wani.
I had to sit and wait.	Sai da na zauna na jira.
But the second.	Amma na biyu .
You need to take care of yourself as best you can.	Kuna buƙatar kula da kanku mafi kyawun abin da za ku iya.
I think there is no way we can be together.	Ina tsammanin babu yadda za mu kasance tare.
He only uses you, and he will never leave me.	Yana amfani da ku kawai, kuma ba zai taɓa barin ni ba.
I continued.	Na ci gaba.
You are outside now.	Kana waje yanzu.
The food was delicious!	Abincin ya yi dadi!
I can't tell you right now.	Ba zan iya gaya muku ba a yanzu.
I will not ask myself.	Ba zan tambayi kaina ba.
We love the house.	Muna son gidan.
That is not true.	Hakan kuma ba gaskiya ba ne.
We got a job.	Mun sami aikin yi.
Eventually it will appear.	A ƙarshe zai bayyana.
And about us.	Kuma game da mu.
They talked a little.	Sun yi magana kadan.
We don't have much time.	Ba mu da lokaci mai yawa.
I'll call you tomorrow.	Zan kira ka gobe.
You've been up for a while.	Kun tashi na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
They quickly collided.	Cikin sauri suka yi karo.
I think she knew something.	Ina ganin ta san wani abu ne.
We should get up to the meeting, early.	Ya kamata mu tashi zuwa taron, da wuri.
Something must be done about it tomorrow.	Dole ne a yi wani abu game da shi gobe.
Looking for a new job is just getting her every day.	Neman sabon aiki shine kawai samun ta kowace rana.
I don't know if that suits you.	Ban sani ba ko hakan ya dace da ku.
So kind of.	Don haka irin.
That helps me get closer.	Hakan yana taimaka mani kusa.
I have been here for years.	Na zo nan tsawon shekaru.
But he did not tell anyone.	Amma bai ce wa kowa komai ba.
We will talk about it if we have more time.	Za mu yi magana game da shi idan mun sami ƙarin lokaci.
Hopefully they will.	Da fatan za su yi.
Please make sure it doesn't reach me.	Don Allah a tabbata cewa bai kai ni ba.
They don’t have time for that.	Ba su da lokaci don wannan.
There is nothing you can not get.	Babu abin da ba za ku iya samu ba.
No one will stop to help you.	Babu wanda zai tsaya ya taimake ku.
Man.	Mutum .
At this point, nothing more.	A wannan lokacin, babu wani abu kuma.
He will surely return.	Tabbas zai koma.
But it did happen.	Amma haka ta faru.
Do not touch this.	Kar a taba wannan.
She just wants to talk.	Magana kawai take so.
If they come here, you will die.	Idan sun zo nan, za ku mutu.
It was a car coming out.	Mota ce ta fito waje.
I do not see how you can be expected.	Ban ga yadda za a yi tsammanin ku ba.
I did not read the book.	Ban karanta littafin ba.
I don't have to bring it.	Bai kamata in kawo shi ba.
They still want to know where it came from.	Har yanzu suna son sanin inda ya fito.
I just came here.	Na zo nan kawai.
They couldn’t and still haven’t had a year.	Ba su iya ba kuma har yanzu ba su da shekara guda ba.
It's early, so there is still time.	Yana da wuri, don haka akwai sauran lokaci.
He closed the door gently.	Ya rufe kofar a hankali.
John was surprised.	John ya yi mamaki.
Everyone needs their favorite.	Kowa yana buƙatar abin da ya fi so.
He did not know that she would do it.	Bai san za ta yi hakan ba.
Everything has changed.	Komai ya canza.
You must stop doing this.	Dole ne ku daina yin hakan.
I need to know how he did it.	Ina bukata in san yadda ya yi.
I will pay you.	Zan biya ku.
It was useless.	Bai kasance da amfani ba.
He did not raise his hand.	Bai daga hannu ba.
It was a nice place to stay.	Wuri ne mai daɗi da zama.
I highly recommend them.	Ina ba da shawarar su sosai.
So the decision for us was very simple.	Don haka shawarar a gare mu ta kasance mai sauƙi.
Now it's gone.	Yanzu abin ya tafi.
She wouldn’t like me, of course.	Ba za ta so ni ba, ba shakka.
You have to do it though, for all of us.	Dole ne ku yi shi ko da yake, a gare mu duka.
They do not know.	Ba su sani ba.
More than that.	Fiye da haka.
Time is running out.	Lokaci ya tafi da sauri.
She decided that.	Ta yanke shawarar cewa.
Something else is happening.	Wani abu kuma yana faruwa.
The water must be cold now.	Dole ne ruwan ya yi sanyi a yanzu.
I do not know what to do!	Ban san abin da zan yi ba!
I am on my way	Ina kan hanya
And it can be a good life.	Kuma yana iya zama rayuwa mai kyau.
I can not answer these.	Ba zan iya amsa waɗannan ba.
An error occurred.	An sami kuskure.
He left it now.	Ya bar shi a yanzu.
We know how they are.	Mun san yadda suke.
You can do more than that.	Kuna iya yin fiye da haka.
Otherwise, they would not be fighting.	In ba haka ba, ba za su kasance suna faɗa ba.
I think it's amazing.	Ina tsammanin yana da ban mamaki.
People are sleeping.	Mutane suna barci.
I do not understand.	Ban gane ba.
Talk about being simple.	Yi magana game da zama mai sauƙi.
She did not enjoy this work.	Ba ta ji daɗin wannan aikin ba.
Bad thoughts, hopefully they will not.	Mummunan tunani, da fatan ba za su yi ba.
Just himself.	Shi kansa kawai.
We'd love to put your stuff down a bit.	Mun ji daɗin sa kayan ku kaɗan.
Where is the nearest bus stop?	Ina tashar bas mafi kusa yake?
There is no help for him.	Babu taimako gare shi.
She died wrong.	Ta mutu ba daidai ba.
We will do everything for you.	Za mu yi muku komai.
That is upon us.	Wannan yana kan mu.
Drink carefully.	Sha a hankali.
It is raining today.	An yi ruwan sama a yau.
However, this is not necessary.	Duk da haka, wannan ba lallai ba ne.
This is the seat.	Wannan shine wurin zama.
This is exactly what it feels like to be me.	Wannan shine ainihin abin da yake ji kamar zama ni.
These things are just fun.	Waɗannan abubuwan suna da daɗi kawai.
Let’s encounter it a little bit.	Bari mu ci karo da shi kadan.
Still she has things to say in the past.	Duk da haka tana da abubuwan da za ta ce a baya.
He went.	Ya tafi.
This is really interesting.	Wannan yana da ban sha'awa da gaske.
Call you that.	Kira ku cewa.
We went out.	Muka fita.
I like some of this.	Ina son wasu daga cikin wannan.
It is best only when water is not used.	Mafi girma ne kawai lokacin da ba a amfani da ruwa.
He didn’t try to tell me it would be okay.	Bai yi ƙoƙarin gaya mani ba zai yi kyau.
He is still there.	Har yanzu yana can.
Yet this time it was not for him, but for her.	Amma duk da haka wannan lokacin ba don shi ba ne, amma ta.
I know what people want to drink.	Na san abin da mutane ke so su sha.
He was put to work at the station.	Aka sa shi aiki a tashar.
Joke.	Abin ban dariya.
She wants to live again.	Tana son ta sake rayuwa.
It is not a very good place.	Ba wuri ne mai kyau sosai ba.
It didn't work for me.	Bai yi min daidai ba.
I'm scared.	Ina tsoro.
Tana d'akin.	Tana d'akin.
It must have been.	Lallai ta kasance.
And it is cold.	Kuma sanyi ne.
You can take it carefully at first.	Kuna iya ɗauka a hankali da farko.
This is where the man left you.	A nan ne mutumin ya bar ku.
He covered the man completely.	Ya rufe mutumin gaba daya.
Almost everything he sees will remind him of you.	Kusan duk abin da ya gani zai tuna masa da ku.
Getting to see the movie.	Samun ganin fim.
It's a thing of the past.	Wani abu ne da ya wuce.
In fact, doing so is the right thing to do.	A gaskiya, yin hakan daidai ne.
She agreed to see it.	Ta yarda ta gani.
Occasionally, a person hears about unusual events.	Wani lokaci, mutum ya ji labarin abubuwan da ba a saba gani ba da suka faru.
This must be ensured.	Dole ne a tabbatar da hakan.
It doesn't seem to be working.	Da alama baya aiki.
Tell him to drive slowly.	Ka gaya masa ya kara tuƙi a hankali.
It was not delivered.	Ba a kai shi ba.
Do not let it brown.	Kar a bar shi yayi ruwan kasa.
You were captured, you died.	An kama ka, ka mutu.
She is upset.	Ta bata rai.
People have to be smart.	Dole ne mutane su kasance masu hankali.
The rest did not take it.	Sauran ba su dauka ba.
After that, she goes to school apparently.	Bayan haka, tana zuwa makaranta da alama.
She gave them to you because she loved you.	Ta ba ku su ne saboda tana son ku.
I do not understand how.	Ban gane yadda ba.
I never went there, even once.	Ban taba zuwa wurin ba, ko da sau daya ne.
Maybe he didn't like it.	Wataƙila bai ji daɗin hakan ba.
He was right to be.	Ya yi daidai ya kasance.
They collided with each other.	Sun yi karo da juna.
I think it will work.	Ina tsammanin zai yi aiki.
This is sometimes difficult to do.	Wannan wani lokacin yana da wuya a yi.
They have decided not to attend.	Sun yanke shawarar ba za su je bikin ba.
This is truly a miracle.	Gaskiya wannan abin mamaki ne.
It's not good at all.	Ba shi da kyau ko kadan.
There is no right or wrong way.	Babu hanyar da ta dace ko kuskure.
I am nobody, except me.	Ni ba kowa ba ne, sai ni.
I tried doing something like this.	Na gwada yin wani abu kamar wannan.
This was very close.	Wannan ya kasance kusa sosai.
There was fear at the time.	Akwai tsoro a lokacin.
This dog needs a good home.	Wannan kare yana buƙatar gida mai kyau.
We see growth for us here.	Muna ganin girma a gare mu a nan.
He seems to be getting all the time cold.	Da alama ya kasance yana samun duk lokacin sanyi.
But it turned out to be true.	Amma ya zama gaskiya ne.
However, he continued.	Duk da haka, ya ci gaba.
He was the only one to sign.	Shi kadai ne ya sanya hannu.
We bought two.	Mun sayi biyu.
He did not, however, play his favorite game.	Bai yi ba, duk da haka, ya buga wasan da aka fi so.
He did not begin to speak.	Bai fara magana ba.
She is going to die.	Ita ce zata mutu.
That's right.	Haka shi yake.
Yet he seems to have done so.	Amma duk da haka da alama ya yi haka.
Reflect.	Yi tunani.
He could not stop laughing.	Ya kasa daina dariya.
That's the way it is.	Haka abin yake.
He speaks slowly.	A hankali yake magana.
But I did not get it.	Amma ban samu ba.
I'm almost out.	Na kusa fita.
You can have a house.	Kuna iya samun gidan.
After a while she stopped.	Bayan wani lokaci ta tsaya.
Play for yourself.	Yi wasa don kanku.
He took it.	Ya dauka ya yi.
I'm pretty sure.	Na tabbata kadan.
Things were going well at the time.	Abubuwa sun yi kyau a lokacin.
So, it is better to use only one.	Don haka, yana da kyau don amfani guda ɗaya kawai.
We started talking.	Muka fara magana.
I was looking for a job every day but without success.	Ina neman aiki kowace rana amma ba tare da wata nasara ba.
He wanted to do what was right.	Ya so ya yi abin da yake daidai.
Done for.	An gama don.
I can reach the end easily.	Zan iya kai ga ƙarshe cikin sauƙi.
And now he knows what it is.	Kuma yanzu ya san me take.
Save it for the one who did it alone.	Ka ajiye shi ga wanda ya yi shi kawai.
I heard it.	Na ji shi.
I could not stop crying.	Na kasa daina kuka.
And who can be, say.	Kuma wa zai iya zama, ka ce.
It will happen, it will happen, it will happen.	Zai faru, zai faru, yana faruwa.
They can all fly.	Duk za su iya tashi.
It is another thing.	Wani abu ne kuma.
She must have told him.	Lallai ta dan ce masa.
We know and understand that.	Mun sani kuma mun fahimci hakan.
That's too much.	Hakan yayi yawa.
Nothing can be done for him now.	Babu wani abu da za a yi masa a yanzu.
I have to tell you this story.	Dole ne in ba ku labarin nan.
I do not know.	Ban sani ba.
Not today.	Ba yau ba.
Shut up, hurry up!	Ka rufe, da sauri!
Or nothing.	Ko ba komai.
This is not about you.	Wannan ba game da ku ba ne.
We began to see what was happening.	Mun fara ganin abin da ke faruwa.
Something.	Wani abu.
You have that opportunity.	Kuna da wannan damar.
Consumption is not the best work just because.	Amfani ba shine mafi kyawun aikin ba kawai saboda.
I still have a year left, so we have a lot of time.	Har yanzu ina da sauran shekara, don haka muna da lokaci mai yawa.
I will try this method.	Zan gwada wannan hanyar.
Show her you right.	Nuna mata kai daidai da ita.
Almost no one likes music.	Kusa da ba wanda ke son waƙa.
We love each other.	Mun so juna.
No diners.	Babu masu cin abinci.
Things are better for everyone when she is here.	Abubuwa sun fi kyau ga kowa lokacin da take nan.
Not now, how.	Ba yanzu ba, ta yaya.
He does not even point out any mistakes.	Ba ya ma nuna wani kuskure.
Maybe they prefer to travel.	Wataƙila sun fi son tafiya.
They are often left alone	Sau da yawa ana barin su gaba ɗaya su kaɗai
I prepared for him.	Na shirya masa.
She did a good job.	Ta yi aiki mai kyau.
Happy New Year.	Shekara mai kyau.
She could not stop thinking about him.	Ta kasa daina tunanin sa.
This restaurant is known for its delicious food.	An san wannan gidan cin abinci don abinci mai daɗi.
In a good way.	Ta hanya mai kyau.
Do you like others?	Kuna son wasu?
It's a pity.	Abin bakin ciki ne.
He can do it.	Zai iya yin shi.
He stood ready to fight.	Ya tsaya yana shirin fada.
Not the best.	Ba shine mafi kyau ba.
Something is happening here.	Wani abu ke faruwa a nan.
Everything here has been and is being.	Komai a nan ya kasance kuma yana nan.
The truth is.	Gaskiya ita ce.
We will help in any way we can.	Za mu taimaka ta kowace hanya da za mu iya.
I’m glad to hear both of you are working.	Na yi farin ciki da jin ku biyu kuna aiki.
Some of them will be clear.	Wasu daga ciki za su bayyana hankali.
That's how they felt.	Haka suka ji.
Only the second son.	Dan na biyu ne kawai.
She doesn't care either.	Ita ma bata damu da hakan ba.
It looks great, doesn't it?	Yana da kyau sosai, ko ba haka ba?
Boy, is it late.	Yaro, ya makara.
That will not work.	Hakan ba zai yi aiki ba.
I know where to put it.	Na san inda za mu ajiye shi.
Tomorrow, it could be a fight.	Gobe, yana iya zama fada.
He needs to hear from you.	Yana bukatar ya ji daga gare ku.
The house is nice.	Gidan yayi kyau.
My back went home.	Baya na ya koma gida.
Sometimes you have to try it.	Wani lokaci dole ne ka gwada shi.
The day passed, then three, then a week.	Rana ta wuce, sai uku, sai mako guda.
I doubted, I was surprised by this need.	Na yi shakka, na yi mamakin wannan bukata.
Although he initially refused, he eventually agreed.	Ko da yake da farko ya ƙi yarda, a ƙarshe ya yarda.
We have to go back.	Dole ne mu koma.
Nothing interesting, really.	Babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa, gaske.
I have nothing to do with it.	Ba ni da wani aiki tare da shi.
They think they are better than others.	Suna ganin sun fi wasu.
Of course not.	Tabbas ba zata je ba.
But not for a while.	Amma ba na ɗan lokaci ba.
I'll know how.	Zan san yadda.
This is great.	Wannan yayi kyau.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
The rest are all asleep.	Sauran duk barci suke yi.
I hope it will continue every day.	Ina fatan za a ci gaba a kowace rana.
He is tired of telling him what to do.	Ya gaji da fada masa abin yi.
We want to get out and run.	Muna son fita da gudu.
He quickly ate dinner.	Da sauri ya ci abincin dare.
I was, not surprisingly, on the ground.	Na kasance, ba mamaki, a kasa.
You can get it.	Kuna iya samun shi.
We are looking for a new job.	Muna neman sabon aiki.
Some are good, some are not.	Wasu suna da kyau, wasu ba su da kyau.
What a surprise.	Wani abin mamaki.
Be up to the ears in.	Aiki yayi yawa.
It would be great.	Zai yi kyau sosai.
Another great thing to do.	Wani babban abin yi.
I know, and everyone here knows, exactly where she is.	Na sani, kuma kowa a nan ya san, daidai inda take.
He had to come up with something better.	Dole ne ya fito da wani abu mafi kyau.
No one wants to stay here.	Babu mai son zama a nan.
I want him back, of course.	Ina so ya dawo, ba shakka.
Now go home.	Yanzu ka koma gida.
For us, just being on the road is good.	A gare mu, kawai zama a kan hanya yana da kyau.
It's just a matter of waiting.	Abin jira ne kawai.
I killed a man.	Na kashe mutum.
Heaven forbid.	Sama sama .
Three years early.	Shekara uku da wuri.
I used to get new coffee every year.	Na kasance ina samun sabon kofi kowace shekara.
I didn't get that.	Ban samu wannan ba.
If not, try these.	Idan ba haka ba, gwada waɗannan.
That was right next to me.	Wannan ya kasance kusa da ni.
So it is said, the work did not stop.	Don haka ana cewa, aikin bai tsaya ba.
Maybe you will.	Wataƙila za ku kasance.
It is truly amazing.	Lallai abin mamaki ne.
Decide what you want to do and do it.	Yanke shawarar abin da kuke son yi da yin shi.
There is better to get.	Akwai mafi kyau a samu.
That did not work well.	Hakan bai yi kyau ba.
He didn't care how it was done, that's all.	Bai damu da yadda aka yi ba, haka ne kawai.
I hear it more and more.	Ina ƙara jin shi.
Somehow.	Ko ta yaya.
They will not come to the ceremony.	Ba za su zo bikin ba.
I feel they have been used a lot.	Na ji an yi amfani da su sosai.
You are right, you know so much.	Kai mai gaskiya ne, ka san da yawa haka.
There was laughter.	Aka yi ta dariya.
We were the closest.	Mun kasance mafi kusa.
I love you more than life.	Ina son ku fiye da rayuwa.
She is with you.	Tana tare da ku.
I think she loves you a little.	Ina jin tana son ku kadan.
But there will never be success.	Amma ba za a taɓa samun nasara ba.
One wonders what to do next.	Mutum zai yi mamakin abin da zai yi bayan haka.
Everything he expected to happen did not happen.	Duk abin da ya yi tsammanin zai faru bai faru ba.
Go there and read, it is still here.	Ku je can ku karanta, har yanzu yana nan.
I kept trying to think of myself out of it.	Na ci gaba da ƙoƙari na yi tunanin kaina daga ciki.
Now it is easier to do.	Yanzu ya fi sauƙi a yi.
He just uses people to get what he wants and then move on.	Kawai yana amfani da mutane yana samun abin da yake so sai ya ci gaba.
He would never do it.	Ba zai taba yi ba.
If it works, fine.	Idan yana aiki, lafiya.
Maybe I left someone else.	Wataƙila na bar wani.
There she is!	Akwai ita!
There is nothing good about it.	Babu wani abu mai kyau game da shi.
But that should not be the case.	Amma hakan bai kamata ba.
Whatever they are.	Duk abin da suke.
So do not forget this.	Don haka kada ku manta da wannan.
Unable to reach the door, he knocked on the door.	Bai iya isa bakin k'ofar ba, sai ya buga k'ofar.
I'm glad to hear that.	Na yi farin cikin jin wannan.
It's amazing.	Abin mamaki ne.
We have proven its use in children.	Mun tabbatar da amfani da shi a cikin yara.
Each thirty will be reviewed.	Za a duba kowane talatin.
Hope this helped.	Da fatan wannan ya taimaka.
Actually, it is not.	A gaskiya, ba haka ba ne.
We can try it now.	Za mu iya gwada shi a yanzu.
He said there were times when he felt like going out.	Ya ce akwai lokacin da ya ji kamar fita.
It will be a new brand.	Zai zama sabon alama.
However, this is not enough.	Duk da haka, wannan bai isa ba.
Obviously this does not work.	Babu shakka wannan baya aiki.
It's just amazing.	Abin mamaki ne kawai.
It was never tested and was released after two years.	Ba a taɓa gwada shi ba kuma an sake shi bayan shekaru biyu.
Of course she is still better than before.	Tabbas har yanzu ta fi kyau fiye da da.
There is help there, honestly !!.	Akwai taimako a can, gaskiya!!.
I let him do it for others.	Na bar shi ya yi wa wasu.
This is not good.	Wannan ba shi da kyau.
We did not.	Ba mu yi ba.
If they do.	Idan ma sun yi.
She forgot the three coins she remembered.	Ta manta kud'i uku da ta tuna.
There is something before that.	Akwai wani abu kafin wannan.
Of course it is.	Tabbas haka abin yake.
Happy marriage.	Aure mai dadi.
No one we know.	Ba wanda muka sani.
Many people have heard that.	Mutane da yawa sun ji haka.
And it shouldn't.	Kuma bai kamata ba.
It is sad to hear that.	Abin bakin ciki ne jin haka.
We need some help.	Muna neman wani taimako .
However, it is done all the time.	Duk da haka, ana yin shi a kowane lokaci.
I hope you have a wonderful day.	Ina fata kuna da rana mai ban sha'awa.
They were killed.	An kashe su.
Heat must be removed from the elements.	Dole ne a cire zafi daga abubuwan.
Hope you find something else !.	Fata ku sami wani abu kuma!.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Babu komai a kai.
Plan to start a project with someone.	Shirin fara aikin wasa tare da wani.
Take the rest of the week.	Ɗauki sauran mako.
But do something.	Amma yi wani abu.
I'm just tired.	Na gaji ne kawai.
He had to stop thinking that.	Dole ya daina tunanin haka.
We must go!	Dole ne mu tafi!
Nothing weird at all.	Babu wani abu na ban mamaki ko kadan.
Hope you enjoy reading them.	Da fatan za ku ji daɗin karanta su.
You lose consciousness completely.	Kuna rasa hankali gaba daya.
It is something we can walk right on.	Abu ne da za mu iya tafiya daidai.
Either way, they died as they were.	Komai hanyar, sun mutu kamar yadda suke.
We drove together.	Muka yi mota tare.
This is always a pleasure anyway.	Wannan shine ko da yaushe abin jin daɗi ta wata hanya.
Everyone is playing except me!	Kowa yana wasa sai ni!
There is still a lot of work to be done.	Har yanzu akwai babban aiki da za a yi aiki.

Just looking for fun !.	Kallon kawai don jin daɗi!.
Now I will call it.	Yanzu zan kira shi.
Take care of your health.	Kula da lafiya.
I did not get it.	ban samu ba.
I want to show it again.	Ina so in sake nuna shi.
We can find what works best for me.	Za mu iya samun abin da ke aiki mafi kyau a gare ni.
I'm not sure if it was written.	Ban tabbata ko an rubuta shi ba.
He raised his hand in triumph.	Ya daga hannu cikin nasara.
You do not have time to think.	Ba ku da lokacin yin tunani.
Of course not.	Tabbas ba ta yi ba.
Do not kill.	Kada ku kashe.
They do not have to worry about that.	Ba lallai ne su damu da hakan ba.
Maybe it was too fast.	Wataƙila ya yi sauri da sauri.
I think you need to take it easy.	Ina tsammanin kuna buƙatar ɗaukar shi cikin sauƙi.
I will say it again, only.	Zan sake cewa, kawai.
I can do that, she said.	Zan iya yin hakan, in ji ta.
People will come soon, some people, she will call them.	Mutane za su zo nan da nan, wasu mutane, za ta kira su.
They did.	Haka suka yi.
I honestly don't know what to do.	Gaskiya ban san me zan yi ba.
They did a little bit.	Sun yi kadan kadan.
We run until we reach the end.	Muna gudu har sai mun zo ga ƙarshe.
I was happy it stood right in my way.	Na yi farin ciki ya tsaya daidai a hanya ta.
Even back when she was a little bit.	Ko da baya lokacin da take dan abu kadan.
A man came out of the back of the car.	Wani mutum ne ya fito daga bayan motar.
How is the dress?	Yaya rigar ta kasance?
What is the nearest.	Menene mafi kusa.
They are cut from food.	An yanke su daga abinci.
To be a role model.	Don zama abin koyi.
We can see it here with them.	Za mu iya gani a nan tare da su.
They are missing.	Sun rasa.
He let them go.	Sai ya bar su su tafi da shi.
He enjoyed eating this food.	Ya ji daɗin cin wannan abincin.
He was a child.	Ya kasance yaro.
Of course it is.	Tabbas haka ne.
The house is too cold.	Gidan yayi sanyi sosai.
Whoever agrees to do so, whoever agrees with them.	Wanda ya yarda ya yi, wanda ya yarda da su.
I do not believe this is enough.	Ban yarda wannan ya isa ba.
She is more comfortable today.	Ta fi yarda yau.
I said, not really.	Na ce, ba sosai ba.
All must be reviewed.	Dole ne a duba su duka.
This is not happening today.	Wannan ba yau yake faruwa ba.
Not really for them.	Ba ainihin gaske gare su ba.
But because she has none.	Amma saboda ba ta da ko ɗaya.
I will not be late.	Ba za a yi ni ba sai a makara.
You are alone.	Kai kadai ne.
We must do this once in a lifetime.	Dole ne mu yi wannan sau ɗaya a rayuwa.
I always succeed.	Na kan yi nasara.
I started to feel sick again.	Na fara jin rashin lafiya kuma.
I have to find out about them, too.	Dole ne in gano game da su, kuma.
It's cold.	Yayi sanyi.
The problem is that this does not work.	Matsalar ita ce wannan ba ya aiki.
They could not, or could not.	Ba su iya, ko kuma ba za su iya ba.
She has no fear.	Ba ta da wani tsoro.
Bring it.	Da kawo shi.
And you speak well, you can speak.	Kuma kuna magana da kyau, kuna iya magana.
If he runs, he can catch her.	Idan ya gudu, zai iya kama ta.
They did not stop coming.	Ba su daina zuwa.
Just prepare the steering.	Kawai a shirya tuƙi.
I know there is a way to prove it wrong.	Na san akwai hanyar tabbatar da ba daidai ba.
Sorry to be that way.	Yi hakuri da zama haka.
And I think she loves me very much.	Kuma ina tsammanin tana son ni sosai.
He was in charge of food purchases.	Ya kasance mai kula da siyan abinci.
It came out wrong.	Ya fito ba daidai ba.
She changed into a beautiful wedding dress.	Ta canza zuwa wani kyakkyawan rigar bikin aure.
The man appeared to be lying.	Mutumin ya bayyana yana karya.
You look nice.	Kun yi kyau.
He was great to work with.	Ya kasance mai girma don yin aiki tare.
You thought that would happen.	Kun yi tsammanin hakan zai faru.
And both of you can do the same.	Kuma ku biyu za ku iya yin hakan ma.
I remember that night.	Na tuna wannan daren.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
Have you heard that.	Shin kun ji wannan.
Many people have tried to change that.	Mutane da yawa sun yi ƙoƙari su canza hakan.
They could not swim.	Ba su iya yin iyo ba.
Work, sleep school.	Aiki, makaranta barci.
I did not sleep well for three days.	Ban yi barci mai kyau ba tsawon kwana uku.
We should talk.	Ya kamata mu yi magana.
So the process became more difficult.	Don haka hanyar ta kara wahala.
I am one	Ni daya
She told him the police.	Da ta gaya masa 'yan sanda.

He did a few things, but not much.	Ya yi 'yan abubuwa, amma ba yawa.
Someone said something funny.	Wani ya ce wani abu mai ban dariya.
I walk with him.	Ina tafiya da shi.
He will do it for her.	Zai yi mata.
They have no clue.	Ba su da wata alama.
I can't stay for a while.	Ba zan iya zama na ɗan lokaci ba.
What is real is the present moment.	Abin da yake ainihin shine lokacin yanzu.
She always does.	Kullum tana yi.
She wanted to know she was lying.	Ta so ya san karya take yi.
You are always one.	Kullum kuna zama ɗaya.
It must be changed.	Dole ne a canza shi.
It comes to you.	Yana zuwa gare ku.
They came out once, but refused to go for the second time.	Sun fito sau ɗaya, amma sun ƙi tafiya ta biyu.
Save the skin.	Ajiye fata.
Now that is not the case.	Yanzu ba haka yake ba.
Definitely a dog.	Tabbas kare.
She did more than these things.	Ta yi fiye da waɗannan abubuwa.
Please help me fix this problem.	Don Allah a taimake ni in gyara wannan matsalar.
He wanted to do it.	Ya so yayi.
Yet, for me, it has always been what I wanted.	Amma duk da haka, a gare ni, ya kasance koyaushe abin da nake so.
The car is here.	Motar tana nan.
I was very happy because they were so happy.	Na yi farin ciki sosai don sun yi farin ciki sosai.
This is also wrong.	Wannan kuma ba daidai ba ne.
Now we have maybe two healthy.	Yanzu muna da watakila biyu masu lafiya.
This is good.	Wannan yana da kyau.
This is also not true.	Wannan ma ba gaskiya ba ne.
Let your readers remember what you like.	Bar masu karatu da abin da kuka fi so su tuna.
No, it is not necessary.	A'a, baya bukata.
It was cold tonight.	An yi sanyi a cikin daren yau.
Slowly, but she took it.	A hankali, amma ta dauka.
He is my dog.	Shine kare na.
How can one make it.	Ta yaya mutum zai iya sanya shi.
There must be a way.	Dole ne a sami hanya.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a bayyana inda wannan zai fito ba.
It's just sad.	Abin bakin ciki ne kawai.
I don't need that in the morning.	Bana bukatar hakan da safe.
Just add a little interest.	Kawai ƙara ɗan sha'awa.
Probably so.	Wataƙila hakan ya kasance.
Please do not be afraid.	Don Allah kar a ji tsoro.
We are together almost always.	Muna tare kusan koyaushe.
No one can touch this.	Babu wanda zai iya taba wannan.
She couldn't stop thinking about it.	Ta kasa daina tunanin hakan.
I don't have any of the features in this game.	Ba ni da ko ɗaya daga cikin abubuwan da ke cikin wannan wasan.
It's something.	Wani abu ne.
I'm not saying it's good.	Ba ina cewa yana da kyau ba.
I'm not talking about that.	Ba na magana game da wannan.
He knows, not me.	Ya sani, ba ni ba.
Has anyone touched this length of time?	Shin wani ya taɓa wannan tsawon wannan lokacin?
I feel very comfortable.	Ina jin dadi sosai.
But he has a decision to make.	Amma yana da shawarar da zai yanke.
So do we.	Haka mu ma.
Or almost everyone.	Ko kusan kowa.
Maybe so and maybe not.	Wataƙila haka kuma watakila a'a.
He ran away.	Sai ya gudu daga wurin.
It doesn't work right.	Ba ya aiki daidai.
The problem is domestic.	Matsalar ta cikin gida ce.
This is just what we want.	Wannan shi ne kawai abin da muke so.
Things as they are.	Abubuwa kamar yadda suke.
I don't know why, but that's what they call it.	Ban san dalilin ba, amma abin da suka kira shi ke nan.
She has a bad reputation.	Tana da mummunan suna.
I'm afraid of her.	Ina jin tsoro daga gare ta.
It is difficult to find a comfortable place.	Yana da wuya a sami wuri mai dadi.
You can save that.	Kuna iya ajiye hakan.
We signed for the second time.	Mun sanya hannu a karo na biyu.
He doesn't need one.	Bai bukatar daya.
Take him there.	Kai shi can.
They let her go.	Sun bar ta ta fita.
We will take this by day.	Za mu dauki wannan ta rana.
I was even scared.	Har na ji tsoro.
This is a good opportunity.	Wannan dama ce mai kyau.
You are only paid.	An biya ku kawai.
Who said he paid.	Wanda yace ya biya.
Nowhere to worry.	Ba inda ya damu ba.
We should remember that.	Ya kamata mu tuna cewa.
Why it should.	Me ya sa ya kamata.
The end of the day is exhausting.	Karshen ranar ta gaji.
This may not be correct.	Wannan ba zai iya zama daidai ba.
There is something else.	Akwai wani abu kuma.
Maybe he spent the night doing homework.	Watakila ya kwana yana aikin gida.
The rest can be removed.	Za a iya cire sauran.
He still smokes every opportunity he gets.	Har yanzu yana shan taba duk damar da ya samu.
They helped me out of the car.	Sun taimake ni daga cikin motar.
She needs a drink.	Tana bukatar abin sha.
There is so much waiting.	Akwai jira sosai.
The one who did not.	Wanda bai yi ba.
We drank and ate until they were full.	Muka sha muka ci har suka cika.
But she did not tell me who he was.	Amma bata gaya mani ko wanene shi ba.
He didn’t, and he couldn’t get it.	Bai yi ba, kuma ba zai iya samu ba.
Let me try this.	Bari in gwada wannan.
However he could not let this pass.	Duk da haka ya kasa barin wannan ya wuce.
He did not stop.	Bai tsaya ba.
He opened his stomach.	Ya bude ciki.
Hope you like it !.	Da fatan kuna son shi!.
Increased productivity is guaranteed.	An tabbatar da ƙara yawan aiki.
I'm not used to it.	Ban saba ba.
I am a smart person.	Ni mutum ne mai hankali.
I don’t know what would be best for anyone.	Ban san abin da zai fi kyau ga kowa ba.
It is a way to protect them.	Ita ce hanyar kare su.
It has never been released.	Ba a taba sake shi ba.
Change only one thing at a time.	Canza abu ɗaya kawai a lokaci guda.
I hear from them every day.	Ina ji daga gare su kowace rana.
He knew he should run.	Ya san ya kamata ya gudu.
But you have it.	Amma kuna da shi.
Bring me.	Ka zo da ni.
He can't sign.	Ba zai iya sa hannu ba.
She read it twice.	Ta karanta sau biyu.
Maybe she wants to look good.	Watakila tana son duba gani.
I used to tell him that.	Na kasance ina gaya masa haka.
Probably not, though.	Wataƙila ba, ko da yake.
Not necessarily the best players, 'he said.	Ba lallai ba ne mafi kyawun ’yan wasa,' in ji shi.
He knows where my head is.	Ya san inda kaina yake.
And it wasn’t his job to start.	Kuma ba aikin sa bane ya fara.
I want to grow up.	Ina so in girma.
Little is known of their existence.	Kadan ne aka san akwai su.
They can't love it.	Ba za su iya son shi ba.
He won’t get that every week.	Ba zai samu haka ba kowane mako.
Work only.	Aikin kawai.
This is not acceptable.	Wannan ba abin yarda ba ne.
She took most of his belongings.	Ta dauki mafi yawan kayan sa.
Still missing a little.	Duk da haka rasa kadan.
So I'm glad to hear you're home.	Don haka na yi farin ciki da jin kuna gida.
Now that is a difficult problem.	Yanzu shine matsala mai wuya.
But she is still there.	Amma duk da haka tana nan.
If you get lost, ask the police.	Idan ka bata, tambayi dan sanda.
All she wants is this.	Ba abin da ta ke so sai wannan.
I am very happy with you.	Ina matukar farin ciki da ku.
Rejoice.	Ku yi farin ciki.
But we changed it.	Amma mun canza shi.
Anything you can think of.	Duk abin da za ku iya tunani.
I asked someone to help me cut them.	Na tambayi wani ya taimake ni in yanke su.
I think it could be.	Ina tsammanin zai iya zama.
Here is each other.	Ga juna.
She did not know where she was going or who she was going to return to.	Ba ta san inda za ta je ba ko wa za ta koma.
I wonder if you can recognize them.	Na yi mamaki kana iya gane su.
It is common.	Na kowa ne.
Sometimes you catch it right.	Wani lokaci kuna kama shi daidai.
It is really something in the making.	Shi ne da gaske wani abu a cikin yin.
Some are doing a good job, some are not.	Wasu suna yin aiki mai kyau, wasu ba su da yawa.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
I don't feel anything for him.	Ba na jin komai a gare shi.
But no one would ever know that.	Amma ba wanda zai taɓa sanin haka.
He left nothing or anyone.	Bai bar komai ko kowa ba.
He thought it was good but was a little surprised.	Ya dauka yana da kyau amma ya dan yi mamaki.
I missed this.	Na rasa wannan.
It may have started to rain all the time.	Wataƙila ya fara yin ruwan sama a kowane lokaci.
Hearing them made him go.	Jin su ya sa ya tafi.
She left the door open.	Ta bar kofar a bude.
He will help me.	Shi ne zai taimake ni.
Everyone would know this immediately.	Da kowa zai gane haka nan da nan.
Imagine what people are saying.	Tunanin abin da mutane ke cewa.
Please give me an answer.	Don Allah a ba ni amsa.
But here's where the good stuff happens.	Amma a nan ne abubuwa masu kyau ke faruwa.
Some will feel lied.	Wasu za su ji karya.
There is nothing that can save it.	Babu wani abu da zai iya ajiye shi.
They start walking again.	Suka fara tafiya kuma.
All of this is amazing.	Duk wannan abin ban mamaki ne.
They make the rest of us uncomfortable.	Suna sa sauran mu ba su da daɗi.
He went back, he could not do anything.	Ya koma, ba zai iya yin wani abu ba.
I have to go in and out.	Dole in shiga in fita.
Everyone around you knows it.	Duk wanda ke kusa da nan ya san shi.
It's just your job.	Aikin ku kawai.
He would like to see us.	Zai so ganin mu.
I took	na dauka
He released her and returned.	Ya sake ta ya koma.
Do not drink or drive.	Kada ku sha kuma ku tuƙi.
Don't let it go '.	Kar a bari a tafi'.
Now we have to go back to school.	Yanzu dole mu koma makaranta.
I'm sure.	Na tabbata.
Which you probably know.	Wanda tabbas kun sani.
This is how it worked.	Wannan shi ne yadda ya yi aiki.
This however is difficult.	Wannan duk da haka yana da wahala.
No need to sit.	Babu bukatar zama.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
He will not remove them.	Ba zai cire su ba.
This statement is incorrect.	Wannan magana ba daidai ba ce.
So, we did this in the right way.	Saboda haka, mun yi wannan ta hanyar da ta dace.
Come on, we have work to do.	Ku zo, muna da aikin yi.
Do not look down.	Kar ka kalli kasa.
Such a person can easily be killed.	Irin wannan mutumin zai iya kashe shi da sauƙi.
I seem to be reaching out to you at the same time.	Ina da alama zan kai gare ku a lokaci guda.
Make sure you don't like it.	Ka tabbata ba ka so .
It looks good and runs very fast.	Yayi kyau kuma yana gudu sosai.
You do not understand.	Ba ku gane ba.
But we have to do the work.	Amma dole ne mu yi aikin.
It takes a lot of time.	Yana ɗaukar lokaci da yawa.
He was a great find and is doing really well.	Ya kasance babban samu kuma yana yin kyau sosai.
She decided to try a new tool.	Ta yanke shawarar gwada sabon kayan aiki.
If she called anyone, she would call you.	Idan ta kira kowa, da ta kira ka.
Nice to meet you.	Na yi farin ciki da samun ku.
He wanted to be just the two of them.	Ya so ya zama su biyu kawai.
You asked for this.	Kun nemi wannan.
Absent.	Ba ya nan.
Something like fear.	Wani abu kamar tsoro.
Does it make you feel amazing?	Shin yana sa ka ji ban mamaki?
Of course.	Ya tabbata.
And get out driving.	Kuma fita tuƙi.
Very cold fish.	Kifi mai sanyi sosai.
She showed him where to sit.	Ta nuna masa inda zai zauna.
Please, come in and sit down.	Don Allah, shiga ku zauna.
We are where we are.	Muna inda muke.
But before you know it, a week has passed.	Amma kafin ku sani, mako guda ya wuce.
No. The tools will be functional.	A'a kayan aikin za su zama aiki.
It wasn’t until we started to get cold.	Sai da muka fara sanyi.
If there was anything there they would have found.	Idan da akwai wani abu a can da sun samu.
I can and will.	Zan iya kuma zan.
However, it still happens to me.	Duk da haka, har yanzu yana faruwa da ni.
Just listen.	Ji kawai.
Just happy, happy, happy.	Farin ciki kawai, farin ciki, farin ciki.
And move on.	Kuma ci gaba.
So we are looking for a name.	Don haka muna neman suna.
If things don’t go right they can just kill it.	Idan abubuwa ba su ji daidai ba za su iya kashe shi kawai.
This project has not been decided.	Ba a yanke shawarar wannan aikin ba.
So it doesn’t fit.	Don haka bai dace ba.
It’s a job called well done.	Aiki ne da ake kira da kyau.
She doesn't know anything about it.	Ba ta san komai a kai ba.
I let a lot of things go.	Na bar abubuwa da yawa su tafi.
If he succeeds they will let him go.	Idan ya yi nasara za su bar shi ya tafi.
He saved money.	Ya ajiye kudi.
It is an unknown age.	Yana da shekaru da ba a sani ba.
We do not use any other method.	Ba mu amfani da wata hanya.
That makes me laugh now.	Wannan yana bani dariya yanzu.
Read it here.	Karanta shi a nan.
You have to really stop and focus here.	Dole ne ku tsaya da gaske kuma ku mai da hankali a nan.
It is not true.	Ba gaskiya ba ne.
But that gave us a way out.	Amma wannan ya ba mu hanyar fita.
We decided to sleep on it.	Mun yanke shawarar yin barci a kai.
There are very few people on the bus now.	Akwai mutane kaɗan a cikin bas yanzu.
Just want to go beyond that together.	Kawai so ya wuce wannan tare.
It will surely pass.	Tabbas zai wuce.
I can take care of it myself.	Zan iya kula da shi da kaina.
I highly recommend this to anyone looking to have a fun time.	Ina ba da shawarar wannan ga duk wanda ke neman samun lokacin farin ciki.
He looked at the rest.	Ya kalli sauran.
They don't want to know, they don't want to hear.	Ba sa son sani, ba sa son jin magana.
I think you heard that.	Ina tsammanin kun ji haka.
I have known her for many years.	Na san ta tsawon shekaru da dama.
They are in the house with the door closed.	Suna cikin gida ta rufe kofar.
But not so here.	Amma ba haka ba a nan.
I ate my meal.	Na ci abinci na.
Once again, they would have done so.	Har yanzu, da sun yi haka.
One and one exactly three.	Daya da daya daidai uku.
Make them understand.	Ka sa su gane.
Do not rush!	Kada ku yi sauri da sauri!
Either way, you seem to be on the right track.	Ko ta yaya, da alama kuna kan hanya.
And maybe we are.	Kuma watakila mu ne.
I took your advice.	Na dauki shawarar ku.
And we get up, every day, a lot.	Kuma muna tashi, a kowace rana, da yawa.
In fact, he is also unemployed.	A gaskiya shi ma ba shi da aikin yi.
Help me get into the moment.	Taimaka min shiga cikin lokacin.
The day was pleasant.	Ranar yayi masa dadi.
Not at this time.	Ba a wannan lokacin ba.
We got after you.	Mun samu bayan ku.
You want to see fear.	Ana son ganin tsoro.
I want more things to do for him.	Ina son ƙarin abubuwan da za su yi masa haka.
Nothing has ever happened to me before.	Ba abin da ya taɓa faruwa da ni a baya.
If they do, great.	Idan sun yi, mai girma.
I had a fight.	Na yi fada.
I don’t feel it’s easy.	Ba na jin yana da sauƙi.
They don’t have to win and they don’t.	Ba sai sun ci nasara ba kuma ba su yi ba.
They just called and said they were going to take someone else.	Sai kawai suka kira suka ce za su tafi da wani.
It should come early.	Kamata yayi ya zo da wuri.
And every reason to do so.	Kuma duk dalilin yin haka.
She knows that.	Ta san haka.
But there is a reason.	Amma akwai dalilin hakan.
She lives somewhere else.	Tana zaune wani waje.
But that is not the end of the story.	Amma wannan ba shine karshen labarin ba.
And anyone who can reach, too.	Kuma duk wanda ke iya isa, ma.
Many people there, such a beautiful driving.	Mutane da yawa a wurin, irin wannan kyakkyawan tuƙi.
The world should know what happened.	Ya kamata duniya ta san abin da ya faru.
If this is your passion, you will not find anything here.	Idan wannan shine sha'awar ku, ba za ku sami komai a nan ba.
But we do not have them.	Amma ba mu da su.
It's the weekend.	Karshen mako ne.
It worked for her.	Ya yi mata aiki.
No one prepared him for the truth.	Babu wanda ya shirya shi ga gaskiya.
Maybe he did.	Wataƙila ya yi.
The water is alive.	Ruwan yana da rai.
One year after this event.	Shekara daya bayan wannan taron.
I think you are one of those few.	Ina tsammanin kuna ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan kaɗan.
The exact date is unknown.	Ba a san ainihin ranar ba.
But suppose he could not.	Amma a ce ba zai iya ba.
They won't tell me.	Ba za su gaya mani ba.
This is not an immediate problem.	Wannan ba shine matsalar nan take ba.
I have to stay.	Dole ne in zauna.
Everything was there.	Komai ya kasance a wurin.
She did not walk.	Ba ta yi tafiya ba.
Nothing, and he doesn't see you that way.	Babu wani abu, kuma baya ganin ku haka.
Some say there was a fight.	Wasu sun ce an yi wani fada.
I know I missed it.	Na san na rasa shi.
But if.	Amma idan .
Even home did not return.	Ko gida bai koma ba.
But that is why we can still make things happen.	Amma shi ya sa har yanzu za mu iya sa abubuwa su faru.
I am with you on that.	Ina tare da ku akan hakan.
Absent.	Ba ya nan.
I know it's true.	Na san gaskiya ne.
She did it again.	Haka ta sake yi.
If you have money, spend it.	Idan kuna da kuɗi, ku kashe shi.
There would have been no place for me.	Da ba a sami wuri a gare ni ba.
They have no money and no food.	Ba su da kuɗi kuma ba su da abinci.
I do not want to miss it.	Ba na son a rasa shi.
That can be a big mistake.	Hakan na iya zama babban kuskure.
He died.	Ya mutu.
She had known for a long time that this would happen.	Ta dade da sanin hakan zai faru.
But, wait a second.	Amma, jira na biyu.
She wanted to reassure him.	Ta so ta tabbatar masa.
I don't even know where to start.	Ban ma san ta inda zan fara ba.
They are not things.	Ba abubuwa bane.
I want to keep you going.	Ina so in sa ku ci gaba.
Do not think so for a moment.	Kada ku yi tunanin haka na ɗan lokaci.
I can't lie to her.	Ba zan iya yi mata karya ba.
But almost everything is gone now.	Amma kusan komai ya tafi yanzu.
From now on you will rise with me.	Daga yanzu za ku tashi tare da ni.
Keep it with you.	Ci gaba da shi tare da ku.
It's an amazing thing.	Wani abu ne mai ban mamaki.
I thought a lot.	Na yi tunani sosai.
He kept talking and talking.	Ya ci gaba da magana yana magana.
Good job.	Kyakkyawan aiki.
He is no longer one person.	Bai sake zama mutum ɗaya ba.
Can anyone show me the right way.	Shin wani zai iya nuna mani hanyar da ta dace.
Whom they will.	Wanda suka so.
But time has passed.	Amma lokaci ya wuce.
I said check.	Na ce a duba.
How interesting would it be ?.	Yaya ban sha'awa zai kasance?.
You give everything.	Kuna ba da komai.
He spoke very well.	Yayi magana mai kyau sosai.
I have a so-called day job.	Ina da abin da ake kira aikin rana.
He never really talked about working with it.	Bai taba magana da gaske game da aiki da shi ba.
He didn't want to think about it.	Bai so yayi tunanin hakan ba.
It was done right away.	Nan take aka yi hakan.
Let it fail.	Bari ta kasa.
There is so much more!	Akwai da yawa da yawa!
He can not see.	Ba ya iya gani.
I live next to him.	Ina zaune kusa da shi.
I will respond this way.	Zan amsa ta wannan hanya.
They say something.	Suka ce wani abu.
Will they let her get another one.	Shin za su bari ta sake samun wani.
Wait for the person to come home wanting you.	Ka jira mutum ya zo gida yana son ka.
Thoughts came and went.	Tunani ne ya zo ya tafi.
Whether what you wrote is true or not.	Ko abin da ka rubuta gaskiya ne ko a'a.
You see the problem.	Ka ga matsalar.
I asked him.	Na tambaye shi.
We will never talk about it again.	Ba za mu ƙara yin magana game da shi ba.
They asked him how he could be killed.	Suka tambayi yadda za a kashe shi.
So much so that he cried.	Sosai yayi kuka.
Maybe even before.	Wataƙila ma kafin haka.
That says a lot.	Wannan ya ce da yawa.
I hope not.	Ina fata ba haka ba.
But he is in trouble.	Amma yana cikin matsala.
But he said nothing.	Amma bai ce komai ba.
He was killed there.	An kashe shi a can.
Of course not.	Tabbas ba shi da kyau.
This country knows well, but fails to remember anything helpful.	Wannan kasa ya sani da kyau, amma ya kasa tuna wani abu mai taimako.
I do not feel comfortable here.	Ban ji dadi a nan ba.
However, they do not grow in the normal way.	Duk da haka, ba sa yin girma a hanyar da aka saba.
She plans to travel at this time.	Ta shirya tafiya a wannan lokacin.
Some work plan.	Wasu shirin aiki.
Once, they felt pain inside.	Sau ɗaya, sun ji zafi a ciki.
Go now, please, and make a better life for yourself.	Ku tafi yanzu, don Allah, kuma ku yi wa kanku rayuwa mafi kyau.
Can you confirm the progress?	Za ku iya tabbatar da yadda ake ci gaba?
For more than one drink.	Don abin sha fiye da ɗaya.
Be careful.	Sai a yi hankali.
It adds to it.	Yana ƙara shi.
She must know they are there.	Dole ta san suna can.
He did not know where he was.	Bai san inda yake ba.
I know a lot.	Na san da yawa.
This is amazing.	Wannan yana da ban mamaki.
Probably better than anyone else.	Wataƙila ma ya fi shi da kowa.
It was not done right.	Ba a yi daidai ba.
Work on it today.	Aiki a kai yau.
There is a better way.	Akwai hanya mafi kyau.
That could be a big mistake.	Wanda zai iya zama babban kuskure.
I work before work every day.	Na yi aiki kafin aiki kowace rana.
She was such an amazing kid.	Ta kasance irin wannan yaro mai ban mamaki.
She came to him.	Ta zo masa.
They are rejected.	An ƙi su.
That does not happen.	Hakan baya faruwa.
This is probably the biggest surprise.	Wannan watakila shine babban abin mamaki.
I really want to do it.	Ina so in yi da gaske.
And people are right to be afraid.	Kuma mutane daidai ne su ji tsoro.
This is not true at all.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane gaba ɗaya.
That doesn't make sense.	Wannan ba ta da hankali.
Sing before bed.	Yi waƙa kafin barci.
I feel they must go immediately.	Ina jin dole ne su tafi nan da nan.
Almost every car is made of metal.	Kusan kowace mota an yi ta ne da karfe.
It can be very weird.	Yana iya zama mai ban mamaki sosai.
There are so many things she wants to say to him.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da take son fada masa.
That's it.	Ita ke nan.
It should be read carefully.	Ya kamata a karanta sosai.
I want to spend some time alone with you.	Ina son wani lokaci ni kaɗai tare da ku.
The restaurant offers a wide range of food.	Gidan cin abinci yana ba da abinci da yawa.
You can try that.	Kuna iya gwada hakan.
So people eat a lot.	Don haka mutane suna ci da yawa.
This, however, did not feel right.	Wannan, duk da haka, bai ji daidai ba.
No, you should go.	A'a, ya kamata ku tafi.
Here, life has not been easy.	A nan, rayuwa ba ta kasance mai sauƙi ba.
He loves you too.	Shi ma yana son ku.
If you have any thoughts.	Idan kuna da wani tunani.
There is always the next time.	Akwai ko da yaushe na gaba lokaci.
She sees people watching them.	Ta ga mutane suna kallon su.
He loves selflessness.	Yana son rashin son kai.
I have to think a lot about other people here, not just me.	Dole ne in yi tunani sosai game da wasu mutane a nan, ba ni kaɗai ba.
It happens.	Yana faruwa.
Tell him what you read if you like.	Faɗa masa abin da kuka karanta idan kuna so.
There is no greater world.	Babu duniya mafi girma.
But it is amazing.	Amma yana da ban mamaki.
He was not allowed to go there.	Ba a yarda ya je wurin ba.
It's more than that.	Ya fi haka.
She wants to live in a beautiful house.	Tana so ta zauna a cikin kyakkyawan gida.
But don't worry.	Amma kar ka damu.
We are tired, but happy.	Mun gaji, amma farin ciki.
He will live in it.	Zai zauna a ciki.
It is something new.	Wani sabon abu ne.
They appear to be true.	Sun bayyana cewa gaskiya ne.
Sorry you are not happy today.	Yi hakuri ba ka da farin ciki a yau.
We were expecting.	Mun kasance muna sa rai.
No, he was talking to someone.	Ba haka ba, yana magana da wani.
I know how it works.	Na san yadda take aiki.
It's very interesting, about us all.	Abu ne mai ban sha'awa sosai, game da mu duka.
Looking back.	Kallon baya.
However, it needs to try something, everything.	Duk da haka, yana buƙatar gwada wani abu, komai.
But it can’t be easy.	Amma ba zai iya zama da sauƙi ba.
She changed a lot.	Ta canza da yawa.
He read quickly.	Yayi karatu da sauri.
Still not available.	Har yanzu bata samu ba.
He started to get up.	Ya fara tashi.
She always tells me.	Kullum tana gaya mani.
You can’t just do both.	Ba za ku iya yin duka biyu kawai ba.
Until one day.	Har wata rana ta yi.
He felt like it would do well.	Ya ji irin wannan zai yi kyau.
This obviously gives you a good impression.	Wannan ya bayyana yana ba ku da kyau.
Do this for a week.	Yi haka har tsawon mako guda.
Go and leave us the rest.	Ku je ku bar mana sauran.
This catches me all the time.	Wannan yana kama ni a kowane lokaci.
He can not walk again.	Ba zai iya sake tafiya ba.
Do what you want.	Yi abin da kuke so.
It's very sad.	Yana da matukar bakin ciki.
This dress is everything.	Wannan rigar ita ce komai.
I feel sad about that.	Na ji bakin ciki da hakan.
And you did it.	Kuma kun yi shi.
How was it in the past?	Yaya ya kasance a da?
There is no doubt.	Ba shi da shakka.
She wanted it, he knew it.	Ta so shi, ya san haka.
Hopefully, he is a game changer in my career.	Da fatan, shine mai canza wasa a cikin aiki na.
I saw they did.	Na ga suna yi.
It took me a while to figure it out.	Na dauki lokaci kafin in gano hakan.
When she will try something.	Lokacin da za ta gwada wani abu.
It’s just a whole bunch, of course.	Kayan gaba daya ne kawai, ba shakka.
I am leaving.	Ina fita.
The work is very interesting.	Aikin yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
It doesn't fit the game.	Ba wasa yayi daidai ba.
It would not be right.	Ba zai zama daidai ba.
I can not take it.	Ba zan iya ɗauka ba.
I look like myself without a shirt.	Ina kama da kaina ba tare da riga ba.
He will eat.	Zai ci abinci.
If not, wait another day.	Idan ba haka ba, jira wata rana.
Many children fail to finish school.	Yara da yawa sun kasa gama makaranta.
But now the world will change.	Amma yanzu duniya za ta canza.
You know me.	Kun san ni.
What a job.	Wane aiki ne.
So, do not do this.	Don haka, kar a yi wannan.
Finally, they left.	A ƙarshe, sun tafi.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
How it was sometimes.	Yadda ya kasance wani lokaci.
He just needs to express himself.	Yana buƙatar kawai ya bayyana kansa.
The train was almost empty.	Jirgin kasa ya kusan gudu babu kowa.
There is something going on outside.	Akwai wani abu da ke faruwa a waje.
He says things have changed.	Yace abubuwa sun canza.
We would not like that.	Ba za mu so hakan ba.
She was a problem, somehow.	Ta kasance matsala, ko ta yaya.
She was at a loss as to what to say.	Ta rasa tabbas me zata ce.
Doing something does not matter.	Yin wani abu ba ya yin komai.
It should not be that bad.	Bai kamata ya zama wannan mummunan ba.
I’ve only had two so far.	Na yi biyu kawai ya zuwa yanzu.
You have work to do.	Kuna da aikin da za ku yi.
And she is better.	Kuma ta fi kyau.
I am from myself.	Na daga kaina.
We have not signed this.	Ba mu sanya hannu kan wannan ba.
Maybe he doesn't act like you.	Wataƙila ba ya yin kamar ku.
I will do whatever it takes to fix it.	Zan yi duk abin da ake bukata don gyara shi.
They sat on the ground.	Suka zauna a kasa.
They said we could talk to him in the morning.	Suka ce za mu iya magana da shi da safe.
She is sure she will remember correctly.	Ta tabbata cewa zata tuna daidai.
He is about to leave.	Ya kusa fita.
A new truth has come.	Wani sabon gaskiya ya zo.
Now this is a scary thought.	Yanzu wannan tunani ne mai ban tsoro.
Do not tell her that she is better than you.	Kada ka gaya mata cewa ta fi maka kyau.
I feel comfortable.	Ina jin dadi.
They also feared us.	Su ma sun ji tsoron mu.
He was always happy to help.	Ya kasance koyaushe yana farin cikin taimaka.
She wants to watch him sleep.	Tana son kallon sa yana barci.
What he found was not surprising.	Abin da ya gano ba abin mamaki ba ne.

It was a great place to go after a drink.	Wuri ne mai kyau don zuwa bayan an sha.
But it also belongs to someone else.	Amma kuma na wani ne.
That must have killed her.	Tabbas da hakan ya kashe ta.
Not really anymore.	Ba sosai ba kuma.
Find out what they want.	Gano abin da suke so.
I like this house.	Ina son wannan gidan.
Whatever they are.	Ko me suke.
Maybe that's not a joke.	Wataƙila hakan bai zama abin wasa ba.
Now it was like one or two.	Yanzu ya kasance kamar ɗaya ko biyu.
This is the one you want to be.	Wannan shine ku da kuke son zama.
If you ask me, you pay.	Idan ka tambaye ni, ka biya.
I think you see where this is going.	Ina tsammanin kun ga inda wannan ke tafiya.
After that day, the world will know him.	Bayan wannan rana, duniya za ta san shi.
This is the first time he has ever thought of such a thing.	Wannan shine karo na farko da ya taba tunanin irin wannan abu.
They just need to be given something to do.	Suna bukatar kawai a ba su wani abu su yi.
They even called again to check everything out next week.	Har ma sun sake kira don duba komai a mako mai zuwa.
It was too big for one person.	Ya yi girma da yawa ga mutum ɗaya.
You made me good money.	Kun yi min kudi mai kyau.
He can join, if he wishes.	Zai iya shiga, idan ya so.
I understand a little bit of it, but it’s amazing.	Na fahimci kadan daga ciki, amma yana da ban mamaki.
Next time.	Wani lokaci.
Not when he touched her again.	Ba lokacin da ya sake taba ta ba.
It is the third in the background.	Na uku ne a baya.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba wannan ba.
They all did well in the first place.	Duk sun yi kyau da farko.
I'm talking about people.	Ina magana ne game da mutane.
He wanted to hear her again about him.	Ya so ya sake jin ta akan shi.
I want to use it one day, however.	Ina so in yi amfani da wata rana, duk da haka.
I do not want to die.	Ba na son in mutu.
But it is definitely true.	Amma ya tabbata yana da gaskiya.
The world has changed but it has not.	Duniya ta canza amma ba ta yi ba.
But let's really get it.	Amma bari mu samu gaske.
The first meal.	Abinci na daya.
He did not stop to think so.	Bai tsaya tunanin hakan ba.
Everyone around him thinks he is very successful.	Duk wanda ke kusa da shi yana tunanin cewa ya yi nasara sosai.
Yes, someone.	Haka ne, wani.
Rejoice in the rest of the year.	Yi farin ciki a cikin sauran shekara.
Whatever they can say or think.	Duk da abin da za su iya fada ko tunani.
And there is a lot.	Kuma akwai mai yawa.
The project was a success.	Aikin ya yi nasara.
I will be fine now.	Zan yi lafiya yanzu.
There he found his way again.	A can ya sake samun kowace hanya.
I will be there.	Zan kasance a can.
They are many.	Suna da yawa.
He was right about that.	Yayi gaskiya akan hakan.
I have this feeling every day in this movie.	Ina da wannan jin kowace rana a wannan fim ɗin.
It's too much for her.	Yayi mata yawa.
They were not there.	Ba su kasance a wurin ba.
It was an awkward trip.	Tafiya ce da ba ta dace ba.
He suggested his place.	Ya ba da shawarar wurin sa.
This is a very interesting book.	Wannan littafin karatu ne mai ban sha'awa.
Maybe she could just cut it.	Watakila ta iya yanke kawai.
But some find it useful.	Amma wasu suna ganin yana da amfani.
Maybe you were paid, maybe you didn’t.	Wataƙila an biya ku, watakila ba ku yi ba.
This year there is a surprise.	A bana akwai abin mamaki.
Now, you are ready.	Yanzu, kun shirya.
She did, you know.	Ta yi, ka sani.
Everything is done.	Komai ya yi.
Sit back, sit back.	Zauna baya, zauna baya.
But do not worry about that.	Amma kada ku damu da hakan.
It will probably rain.	Wataƙila za a yi ruwan sama.
He knows them personally.	Ya san su da kansa.
They bring trouble.	Suna kawo matsala.
Maybe he thought you were hot.	Watakila ya yi tunanin kana da zafi.
The sooner you do this, the better.	Da sauri ka yi wannan, mafi kyau.
It will be here.	Zai kasance a nan.
I looked at one another.	Na duba wani da wani.
He needs to stay safe.	Yana bukatar ya zauna lafiya.
Have you traveled to work?	Shin kun yi tafiya don aiki?
So people like us walk.	Haka mutane kamar mu suke tafiya.
This gives us more time to live.	Wannan yana ba mu ƙarin lokaci don rayuwa.
Interesting things are interesting.	Abubuwan ban sha'awa suna da ban sha'awa.
Go to the scary police.	Tafi ga 'yan sanda masu ban tsoro.
The decision was changed a week later.	An canza shawarar bayan mako guda.
I saw him crying.	Na ga yana kuka.
That may never happen again.	Wataƙila hakan ba zai sake faruwa ba.
It is hot water.	Ruwan zafi ne.
He was right about that.	Yayi gaskiya akan hakan.
I gave her the night to crash.	Na ba ta dare don ta yi karo.
I don’t care about the project.	Ban damu da aikin ba.
Honestly I didn’t try to win.	A gaskiya ban yi ƙoƙarin cin nasara ba.
But the book is too much.	Amma littafin yana da yawa.
Get out of school.	Fita daga makaranta.
This fish is a new species.	Wannan kifi sabon kama ne.
Maybe some were.	Wataƙila wasu sun kasance.
We didn’t fully go out to eat at this time.	Ba mu cika fita don cin abinci a wannan lokacin ba.
Now he does.	Yanzu yana yi.
Now you are the one who will help me.	Yanzu kai ne za ka taimake ni.
It's been a long time coming.	Ya dade da wuce.
It's a good size.	Yana da girma mai kyau.
I hope they are right.	Ina fatan sun yi daidai.
The truth is the same.	Gaskiya guda ce.
I thought she was talking to me, but she wasn’t.	Ina tsammanin tana magana da ni, amma ba ta kasance ba.
Who brought me to my speech.	Wanda ya kawo ni ga magana ta.
We will prepare for him.	Za mu shirya masa.
They have little money.	Suna da kuɗi kaɗan.
This is not very good.	Wannan ba ya da kyau sosai.
I will reach them later.	Zan isa gare su daga baya.
Not so much.	Ba haka yawa ba.
So let's say.	Don haka a ce.
Everything you have told us is false.	Duk abin da ka gaya mana karya ne.
But she is not alone.	Amma ba ita kaɗai ba ce.
So let's get started.	Don haka mu fara.
They say many people have died.	Sun ce mutane da yawa sun mutu.
He heard, but did not understand.	Ya ji, amma bai gane ba.
It is not coming back as quickly as it used to.	Ba a dawo da sauri kamar yadda yake a da ba.
You know now.	Kun san yanzu.
But you are touched and you go away for a while.	Amma an taɓa ku kuma ku tafi na ɗan lokaci.
Without them, you would die.	Ba tare da su ba, za ku mutu.
No one we know.	Ba wanda muka sani.
We don't know anything about where he came from.	Ba mu san komai game da inda ya fito ba.
But really it does not work that way.	Amma da gaske shi ba ya aiki haka.
She leaves the room.	Ta fita daga dakin.
Stop thinking this.	A daina tunanin wannan.
I hope people like it.	Ina fata mutane suna son shi.
It would be nice if so.	Zai yi kyau idan haka ne.
I really enjoyed this purchase.	Na ji daɗin wannan siyan.
So you can stay home too.	Don haka kuna iya zama a gida kuma.
And every pleasure we can have.	Kuma kowane jin daɗi za mu iya samu.
Drive slowly, and do not drive too fast.	Yi tuƙi a hankali, kuma kada ku yi sauri da sauri.
I'm sure it will look good.	Na tabbata za ta yi kyau.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba abin mamaki bane.
Just make sure you know about it ahead of time.	Kawai ka tabbata ka san game da shi kafin lokaci.
He always goes to school.	Kullum yana tafiya makaranta.
Everything will be fine.	Komai zai kasance lafiya.
Only for a while.	Kawai na ɗan lokaci.
I read them.	Na karanta su.
But I feel really good.	Amma ina jin daɗi sosai.
We did not get these.	Ba mu samu waɗannan ba.
She often does.	Tana yawan yi.
And that would be true.	Kuma wannan zai zama gaskiya.
You will wait and see.	Za ku jira ku gani.
He is happy that he can help.	Ya yi farin ciki cewa zai iya taimaka.
Although you probably agree on one thing.	Ko da yake tabbas kun yi daidai akan abu ɗaya .
He never came on time.	Bai taba zuwa akan lokaci ba.
I agree with him.	Na yarda da shi.
I also developed on it.	Ni ma na ci gaba a kansa.
Look, we have not forgotten.	Duba, ba mu manta ba.
They are already dead.	Sun riga sun mutu.
We must take care of each other.	Dole ne mu kula da juna.
There are so many things you can do.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za ku iya yi.
So off we went.	Haka muka tafi.
When we are tired we sleep.	Idan mun gaji muna barci.
However, she seems unable to remove them.	Duk da haka, da alama ba za ta iya cire su ba.
The user can put whatever he wants in it.	Mai amfani zai iya sanya duk abin da yake so a ciki.
I can't find you around me right now.	Ba zan iya samun ku a kusa da ni ba yanzu.
It may be the best for the book though.	Yana iya zama mafi kyau ga littafin ko da yake.
Many people are crying.	Mutane da yawa suna kuka.
No pain.	Babu zafi.
I never got it.	Ban taba samun shi ba.
God still knows that.	Da har yanzu Allah ya san haka.
Of course something amazing is happening.	Tabbas wani abu mai ban mamaki yana faruwa.
I can't believe this is what people think of me.	Ba zan iya yarda cewa wannan shine abin da mutane suke tunani game da ni ba.
Others are still at work.	Wasu kuma har yanzu suna kan aiki.
It has work to do.	Yana da aikin da zai yi.
I think they are, but maybe not for everyone.	Ina tsammanin suna, amma watakila ba ga kowa ba.
Maybe he doesn't come.	Wataƙila ba ya zuwa.
In fact, it can happen faster than we know it.	A gaskiya ma, yana iya faruwa da sauri fiye da yadda muka sani.
He is doing something unusual.	Yana yin abin da ba a saba gani ba.
But he is always there.	Amma ko da yaushe yana can.
Not for everyone.	Ba haka bane ga kowa.
That is not very interesting.	Hakan ba shi da ban sha'awa sosai.
That was not the reason he planned to kill me.	Ba shi ne dalilin da ya ke shirin kashe ni ba.
I did.	Da na yi.
I am not myself now.	Ni ba kaina bane a yanzu.
It's just something my users want.	Wani abu ne kawai masu amfani da nawa suka nemi.
So sit down.	Don haka zauna.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
No one wants to sleep.	Ba wanda ya so ya kwana.
It's not fun.	Ba abin jin daɗi ba ne.
He used people.	Ya yi amfani da mutane.
Now he knows he wants something more.	Yanzu ya san cewa yana son wani abu kuma.
And she will do what you ask.	Kuma za ta yi abin da ka tambaye.
You are having a good time, but the time is not right.	Kuna jin daɗi sosai, amma lokacin bai dace ba.
We will decide what is going on there.	Za mu yanke shawarar abin da ke faruwa a can.
But it is no longer used.	Amma ba a amfani da shi kuma.
He thinks, quickly.	Yana tunani, da sauri.
But the best reaction is to just see people playing.	Amma mafi kyawun dauki shine kawai ganin mutane suna wasa.
And just want one.	Kuma so daya kawai.
No one helped him.	Babu wanda ya taimake shi.
Let it go, let it go!	A bar shi, a bar shi!
You are so beautiful.	Kun yi kyau sosai.
As she never did.	Kamar yadda ta taba yi.
There are many ways.	Akwai hanya da yawa.
This is one person.	Wannan mutum guda.
However, we humans continue to do it.	Duk da haka, mu mutane muna ci gaba da yin shi.
Talk a little.	Yi magana kadan.
If you go out at night.	Idan kun fita da dare.
All of these things are wrong.	Duk waɗannan abubuwan ba daidai ba ne.
They ran before they got the money.	Sun gudu kafin su sami kuɗi.
He said it was too much.	Yace yayi yawa.
It really is on its own right now.	Da gaske ya kasance a kan kansa a yanzu.
It works fine now.	Yana aiki lafiya yanzu.
I was told she was a role model.	An gaya min ita abin koyi ce.
Food is a sensation.	Abinci abin ji ne.
Would you like to travel by plane?	Kuna son tafiya a cikin jirgin sama?
Next time.	Wani lokaci.
Why do I have to do this?	Me ya sa ya zama dole in yi haka?
But it's good for me.	Amma yana min kyau.
So just wait for me.	Don haka ku jira ni kawai.
We make them sick.	Muna sa su rashin lafiya.
That is not why we are here.	Ba shi ya sa muke nan ba.
I can not do anything.	Ba zan iya yin komai ba.
Whether they like it or not.	Ko sun so ko ba sa so.
And that's it.	Kuma shi ke nan.
The story surprised many.	Labarin ya ba mutane da yawa mamaki.
I know this is a good sign.	Na san wannan alama ce mai kyau.
Try it.	Gwada shi.
You never knew the dog.	Ba ka taba sani da kare ba.
She thought he was hurt.	Ta dauka ya ji rauni.
They never heard me speak so much.	Ba su taba jin na yi magana sosai ba.
The sky is always empty.	Kullum sama babu kowa.
It's true.	Gaskiya ne.
If anyone can get it you can.	Idan kowa zai iya samun shi za ku iya.
Everyone nearby loves it.	Duk wanda ke kusa da nan yana son shi.
I feel so good.	Na ji dadi sosai.
I did not see the next one either.	Ni ma ban ga mai zuwa ba.
We are ready to go.	Mun shirya mu tafi.
She was rejected.	An ƙi ta.
Sadness made her cry.	Bakin ciki yasa ta kuka.
He no longer sold us anything.	Bai kara sayar mana da komai ba.
Or tomorrow.	Ko gobe.
I do not know what all this is.	Ban san menene wannan duka ba.
Now she has two.	Yanzu tana da biyu.
I was made to feel fat.	An sa na ji mai.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
Please come with us.	Da fatan za a zo tare da mu.
I did not take it.	Ban dauka ba.
If you are right.	Idan kun yi daidai.
We got nothing.	Ba mu sami komai ba.
And life goes on.	Kuma rayuwa ta ci gaba.
Not necessarily.	Ba lallai ba ne.
Life is too much today.	Rayuwa sun yi yawa a yau.
I don’t see you much every day.	Ba na ganin ku da yawa kowace rana.
They grow and grow rapidly.	Suna girma kuma suna girma da sauri.
So start looking for opportunities.	Don haka sai ku fara neman damar ku.
This restaurant is known for offering good food.	An san wannan gidan cin abinci don ba da abinci mai kyau.
But still she did not.	Amma duk da haka ba ta yi ba.
She cried for the thought to leave her behind.	Kuka ta yi don tunanin bari a baya.
We did too much.	Mun yi yawa da yawa.
Healthy children, a good marriage.	Yara masu lafiya, aure mai kyau.
He did well, so he kept going.	Ya yi kyau, don haka ya ci gaba da shi.
Injury is like water.	Rauni kamar ruwa.
A place where she should feel safe.	Wurin da ya kamata ta ji lafiya.
No one joined her.	Babu wanda ya shiga da ita.
They are harder to do.	Sun fi wuya a yi.
Is it still there?	Har yanzu yana nan?
At that time no one could.	A wannan lokacin babu wanda zai iya.
I'll take her.	Zan kai ta.
There is nothing like it, however.	Babu wani abu da ya yi kama da hakan, duk da haka.
But he knew that.	Amma ya san haka.
Things that will bring him back.	Abubuwan da za su dawo da shi.
I missed it all.	Na rasa shi duka.
He appears to be like her.	Ya bayyana kama da ita.
That happened to him.	Hakan ya faru da shi.
I was with them.	Na kasance tare da su.
I will drink and sleep.	Zan sha in yi barci.
No one spoke.	Babu wanda yayi magana.
A person who does not.	Mutumin da ba ya.
School supplies are not required here.	Ba a buƙatar kayan makaranta a nan.
Let someone tell him.	Bari wani ya gaya masa.
I usually do.	Na saba yi.
Hurry up, or you will miss it.	Yi sauri, ko za ku rasa shi.
I can’t imagine living without it.	Ba zan iya tunanin rayuwa ba tare da shi ba.
Do not say die.	Kada a ce mutu.
Everything is going well.	Duk yana tafiya daidai.
But of course they did.	Amma ba shakka sun yi.
Sometimes this happens two or three times in one night.	Wani lokaci wannan ya faru sau biyu ko uku a cikin dare ɗaya.
The house itself looks good.	Gidan da kansa yayi kama da kyau.
She has to leave it to someone else.	Dole ta bar wa wani.
We are the ones who came out.	Mu ne suka fito.
I will stay with you until you leave.	Zan zauna tare da ku har ku tafi.
Do not forget me.	Kar ka manta da ni.
They want to fix it.	Sun so a gyara shi.
But there is no better answer.	Amma bata da wata amsa da ta fi.
And it will not change.	Kuma ba zai canza ba.
Apparently this movie is doing just that.	Da alama wannan fim ɗin yana yin haka.
She almost didn't fall at the time.	Ta kusa bata fada a lokacin.
For a while, nothing happened.	Na ɗan lokaci, babu abin da ya faru.
That did not work for me.	Wannan bai yi min aiki ba.
Honestly I don't know him very well.	Gaskiya ban san shi sosai ba.
God is everything to me.	Allah shi ne komai nawa.
I live at home with them.	Ina zama a gida tare da su.
I don't see how that can help.	Ban ga yadda hakan zai taimaka ba.
We stopped on the way.	Muka tsaya a hanya.
About very healthy.	Game da lafiya sosai.
There is room for improvement though.	Akwai wurin ci gaba duk da haka.
She did a pretty good job of that.	Ta yi kyakkyawan aiki na hakan.
I pointed out	na nuna
I spend a lot of money and time to get this catch.	Ina kashe kuɗi da yawa da lokaci don samun wannan kama.
Who are we?	Wanene mu.
A loud, terrifying cry.	Kuka mai wuya, mai ban tsoro.
It's good enough for me.	Yana da kyau isa gare ni.
Within a month she became pregnant.	Cikin wata guda ta samu ciki.
Forget it tonight.	Ka manta da shi a daren yau.
If you have a little time, try it now.	Idan kuna da ɗan lokaci kaɗan, gwada shi yanzu.
There was no thought at that moment, and no feeling.	Babu tunani a wannan lokacin, kuma babu ji.
But we do not have time now.	Amma ba mu da lokaci yanzu.
I'll be fine, though.	Zan zama mai kyau, ko da yake.
It has to be.	Dole ta kasance .
We stayed for a week and the place was beautiful.	Mun zauna mako guda kuma wurin yana da kyau.
Maybe he’s trying to see himself bigger.	Wataƙila yana ƙoƙarin ganin kansa ya fi girma.
Not necessarily, you know.	Ba dole ba, ka sani.
Read what happened here.	Karanta abin da ya faru a nan.
Not great but it works perfectly for me.	Ba girma ba amma yana aiki daidai a gare ni.
I will never be here again.	Ba zan ƙara zama a nan ba.
We grew up.	Mun girma.
That's why.	Don haka ne.
You can not rename.	Ba za ku iya sake suna.
He knows we are here.	Ya san muna nan.
She just needs to be where you are.	Ta kawai bukatar ta kasance a wurin da kuka kasance.
In fact, few have.	A gaskiya ma, 'yan kaɗan sun yi.
Or even the day before.	Ko ma ranar da ta gabata.
So, take your time to find the right match.	Don haka, ɗauki lokacin ku don neman wasan da ya dace.
But this is also another day.	Amma wannan ma wata rana ce.
But it's not funny, because it's right.	Amma ba abin dariya ba ne, saboda daidai ne.
There are two people here.	Akwai mutane biyu a nan.
I really like this more than anything.	Ina matukar son wannan fiye da komai.
It only works on volume.	Yana aiki ne kawai akan ƙara.
You did it.	Kun yi shi.
The reason you don’t know must be.	Dalilin da ba ku sani ba dole ne ya kasance.
That is true of us all.	Hakan ya zama daidai a gare mu duka.
He could not give her anything more than he had before.	Bai iya ba ta komai fiye da yadda yake da ita a da.
He is not lying.	Ba karya yake yi ba.
We need your help to continue this work.	Muna buƙatar taimakon ku don ci gaba da wannan aikin.
You seem to be interested in some really good things.	Kamar kuna sha'awar wasu abubuwa masu kyau sosai.
I traveled several times a year.	Na yi tafiya sau da yawa a cikin shekara.
And no children.	Kuma babu yara.
It can do better.	Zai iya yin mafi kyau.
No, he wouldn’t lie here just let it happen.	A'a, ba zai yi karya a nan kawai ya bar abin ya faru ba.

It's over.	Ya wuce.
We must use the tools we have.	Dole ne mu yi amfani da kayan aikin da muke da su.
So, it is.	Don haka, yana da.
Everything they do, they do together.	Duk abin da suke yi, tare suke yi.
It's work time.	Lokacin aiki ne.
And someone loves it.	Kuma wani yana son shi.
So next time you are told the movie you must see it.	Don haka a gaba in an gaya maka fim ɗin dole ne ka gani.

Drink a drink.	Sha abin sha.
Be human about it.	Ka zama mutum game da shi.
It's not even there.	Kamar ba ma can.
You can't get out of the way.	Ba za a iya fita daga hanya ba.
Then someone said.	Sai wani yace.
That is not right.	Hakan bai yi daidai ba.
I think all of this is scary.	Ina ganin duk wannan abin ban tsoro ne.
It can be difficult to let the person go.	Yana iya zama da wahala a bar mutumin ya fara tafiya.
He can wait.	Zai iya jira.
Exactly enough, not a big deal.	Daidai isa, ba babban abu ba.
Can't wait to see it's over.	Ba za a iya jira don ganin an gama ba.
You should not feel that way.	Bai kamata ku ji haka ba.
Or wherever the story will be you are.	Ko kuma duk inda labarin zai kasance ku kasance.
Police were able to arrest them	'Yan sanda sun sami damar kama su
It's not a fun way to go.	Ba hanya ce mai daɗi ba.
She will grow up.	Za ta girma.
She never cried again.	Bata sake masa kuka ba.
First, stop lying about it.	Na daya, daina yin karya game da shi.
The feeling has passed.	Ji ya wuce.
She's a little annoyed.	Ta dan bata rai.
Not for money.	Ba don kudi ba.
He will eventually fall asleep.	Zai yi barci a ƙarshe.
It can't be done.	Ba za a iya yi ba.
Probably not all.	Wataƙila ba duka ba ne.
No one thought they were great.	Babu wanda ya yi tunanin suna da girma.
There is a better way.	Akwai hanya mafi kyau.
I did not, however.	Ban yi ba, duk da haka.
I can even explain something new to other people.	Zan iya ma bayyana sabon abu ga wasu mutane.
I love you too.	Ina son ku ma.
But she would have liked more.	Amma da ta so fiye da haka.
I do not like this.	Ba na son wannan.
Use only once.	Yi amfani da lokaci ɗaya kawai.
This is the last time we are really talking.	Wannan shi ne karo na ƙarshe da muke magana da gaske.
He said it was too much.	Ya fad'a da cewa ya yi yawa.
He is a sweet dog.	Shi kare ne mai dadi.
She often falls asleep early.	Ta kan yi barci da wuri.
And she has a name.	Kuma tana da suna.
Maybe by the time you arrive, we’ll know more.	Wataƙila zuwa lokacin da kuka isa, za mu ƙara sani.
He must have known.	Lallai ya sani.
And that.	Da kuma cewa.
You can get this help.	Kuna iya samun wannan taimako.
Nothing out of the ordinary, and yet.	Babu wani abu daga wurin, kuma duk da haka .
It will bring you much joy and happiness.	Zai kawo muku farin ciki da farin ciki da yawa.
My kids love going there.	Yara na suna son zuwa wurin.
But, in the end, he had to go to work.	Amma, a ƙarshe, dole ne ya tafi aiki.
I felt like myself again.	Na sake ji kamar ni.
Yet she makes me agree.	Amma duk da haka ta sa na yarda.
She took good care of us.	Ta kula da mu sosai.
I don't care, honestly.	Ban damu ba, gaskiya.
They should not get it.	Bai kamata su samu ba.
I want to take it now.	Ina so in ɗauka yanzu.
He’s trying to be funny or something.	Yana ƙoƙari ya zama mai ban dariya ko wani abu.
She is not.	Ba ta shi ba.
But it turned out to be inappropriate.	Amma ya zama bai dace ba.
I never knew what it was.	Ban taba sanin menene ba.
He slept better than to eat.	Ya yi barci ya fi ci abinci.
What are we doing?	Me muke yi.
Want more.	So kuma.
I'm sure she has.	Na tabbata tana da.
It may surprise you !.	Yana iya ba ku mamaki!.
In fact, as we move forward, we find that it is too much.	A gaskiya, kamar yadda muka ci gaba, mun gano cewa yana da yawa.
Let's get it.	Mu samu ta.
At night.	A cikin dare.
It is easier for him to quit smoking.	Ya fi masa sauƙi ya daina shan taba.
I got a lot of help.	Na sami taimako da yawa.
A few things like that.	Kadan abubuwa kamar haka.
Let's start with you.	Bari mu fara da ku.
Help me.	Taimake ni.
It is nothing like nothing can be.	Ba komai bane kamar yadda babu abin da zai iya zama.
You are active and healthy.	Kuna da aiki da lafiya.
I have to work.	Dole ne in yi aiki.
You can't be both.	Ba za ku iya zama duka biyu ba.
It made me feel good about myself.	Ya sa na ji daɗin kaina.
But this is a simple matter.	Amma wannan abu ne mai sauƙi.
Once every two weeks is best.	Sau ɗaya kowane mako biyu ya fi kyau.
At the time she was enjoying life very much.	A lokacin tana jin daɗin rayuwa sosai.
Let's see what we can learn from it.	Bari mu ga abin da za mu sani game da shi.
He said he was fine.	Yace lafiya.
There are still a few benefits.	Har yanzu akwai 'yan amfani.
She only eats food.	Abinci kawai take ci.
That’s a lot of time.	Wannan shine lokaci mai yawa.
But money changes everything.	Amma kudi yana canza komai.
I think it makes him think.	Ina tsammanin ya sa shi tunani.
Everything is fine.	Komai yayi kyau.
I think it is necessary, too.	Ina tsammanin ya zama dole, kuma.
I refused to do that.	Na ƙi yin haka.
We need to put an end to this.	Muna bukatar mu kawo karshen wannan.
Everything was as usual.	Duk ya kasance kamar yadda aka saba.
Now you start reading this so you don’t stop.	Yanzu kun fara karanta wannan don kada ku tsaya.
There is no need to be afraid of us.	Babu bukatar jin tsoron mu.
I did not give it to you for pleasure.	Ban ba ku don jin daɗi ba.
They can be used on its own.	Ana iya amfani da su a kansa.
Inside or outside.	A ciki ko waje.
Do your job well and quickly.	Yi aikin ku da kyau da sauri.
We are so touched, right now.	An taɓa mu sosai, a yanzu.
This is nice, but not great.	Wannan yana da kyau, amma ba mai girma ba.
I tried a second.	Na gwada na biyu.
He stopped, did nothing.	Ya tsaya, bai yi komai ba.
It read amazingly fast.	Ya karanta da sauri mai ban mamaki.
But get involved in a lot of other things.	Amma shiga cikin wasu abubuwa da yawa.
So are the others.	Haka ma sauran.
He looked up.	Ya kalli sama.
This teacher asked for one thing.	Wannan malamin ya nemi abu daya.
I was in the past.	Na kasance a baya.
You will read without thinking.	Za ku karanta ba tare da tunani ba.
You know, this can be very useful.	Ka sani, wannan na iya zama da amfani sosai.
Some do not agree with this.	Wasu ba su yarda da wannan ba.
We cannot accept this!	Ba za mu yarda da wannan ba!
He wouldn’t worry too much.	Ba zai damu da yawa ba.
He is in front of the room	Yana gaba da dakin
I can no longer take this.	Ba zan iya ƙara ɗaukar wannan ba.
Is one of us.	Shin daya daga cikin mu.
Everyone knows them.	Kowa ya san su.
Things did not go well when he got home.	Abu bai fi kyau ba lokacin da ya isa gida.
They just came and went as they pleased.	Sai kawai suka zo suka tafi yadda suka ga dama.
She really wants to go.	Tana matukar son tafiya.
Working for you.	Yin aiki a gare ku.
You get what you get.	Kuna samun abin da kuke samu.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
He wanted to learn something from this.	Ya so ya koyi wani abu daga wannan.
He cares.	Yana kula.
Maybe there is something he can get.	Wataƙila akwai wani abu da zai iya samu.
This is still of interest to such work.	Wannan har yanzu yana da sha'awar irin wannan aikin.
You will remember me.	Za ku tuna da ni.
The game is not over!	Wasan bai kare ba!
Now, she has to accept, she has.	Yanzu, dole ne ta yarda, ta samu.
Like he had to touch her.	Kamar dole ya taba ta.
She is sad.	Ta yi bakin ciki.
Give them that.	Ka ba su su kasance haka.
Please even if you do not remember it, try it.	Don Allah ko da ba ka tuna da ita ba, gwada.
She thought about it when he got up.	Tunanin ta yayi lokacin da ya tashi.
You're in for a treat.	Kuna cikin kan ku a nan.
She was detained by the police.	Yan sanda ne suka tare ta.
He killed someone.	Ya kashe wani.
She has no water.	Ba ta da ruwa.
I find some afraid.	Ina samun wasu suna jin tsoro.
I kept thinking tomorrow would be better.	Na yi ta tunanin gobe zai fi kyau.
I saw someone.	Na ga wani.
He sleeps out.	Yana barci ta fita.
It just happens.	Yana faruwa ne kawai.
Wait for it.	Jira shi.
A little bit.	Abu kadan.
He could have laughed, but nothing happened.	Da zai iya yin dariya da ya yi, amma ba abin da ya faru.
A little cold.	Dan sanyi.
Even this does not tell the whole story.	Ko da wannan bai ba da labarin duka ba.
Feeling this way does not hurt.	Da jin haka bai yi zafi ba.
On your way.	Akan hanyar ku.
Use the same extra.	Amfani da ƙarin guda.
You will not like this article.	Ba za ku so wannan labarin ba.
What kind of food do you like?	Wane irin abinci kuke so?
She told me later.	Ta gaya min daga baya.
He wants you to come home.	Yana son ka dawo gida.
I can’t just cover things up.	Ba zan iya rufe abubuwa kawai ba.
We planned a trip.	Mun shirya tafiya.
It was a night of fear.	Daren tsoro ne.
He certainly did not think it worked.	Babu shakka bai yi tunanin yana aiki ba.
We stopped to enjoy watching.	Mun tsaya don sha'awar kallon.
She made her even happier.	Ta kara yi mata dadi.
The world needs to know more.	Yakamata a sami damar duniya ta san ƙarin.
The story is not interesting to him.	Labarin ba shi da ban sha'awa a gare shi.
And the car she makes.	Da kuma motar da ta ke yin ta.
He never took it.	Bai taba dauka ba.
They know you can make mistakes.	Sun san za ku iya yin kuskure.
You can not worry about me.	Ba za ku iya damu da ni ba.
He lives nearby.	Yana zaune a kusa.
Of course it does not need an answer.	Tabbas bata bukatar amsa.
Things can go any other way.	Abubuwa na iya tafiya ta wata hanya.
I recommend to see her.	Ina ba da shawarar zuwa ganin ta.
She didn't want to be bothered too much or get hurt again.	Ba ta so ta damu da yawa ko kuma ta sake yin rauni.
His head is more clear now.	Kansa ya kara bayyana yanzu.
She tells him not to hurry.	Ta gaya masa kada yayi sauri.
They did nothing.	Ba su yi komai ba.
I'll get there.	Zan isa can.
Without water, humans could not survive.	Idan babu ruwa, mutane ba za su iya rayuwa ba.
Of course there is fighting here.	Tabbas an yi fada a nan.
But we did.	Amma mun yi.
It was then that we met.	A lokacin ne muka hadu da shi.
Meals will also be provided in the afternoon.	Za a kuma ba da abinci da rana kuma.
However, they are suffering.	Duk da haka, suna shan wahala.
It is not always a good thing.	Ba koyaushe abu ne mai kyau ba.
They have been married twice or three times.	Sun yi aure sau biyu ko uku.
A few came slowly.	Wasu 'yan sun zo a hankali.
Using this phrase is scary.	Yin amfani da wannan magana yana da ban tsoro.
It’s kind of making sense.	Yana da irin yin hankali.
Every year, work, work.	Kowace shekara, aiki, aiki.
Real money is required.	Ana buƙatar ainihin kuɗin kuɗi.
Apparently he did not hear.	Ya bayyana bai ji ba.
Not you.	Ba ku ba.
This time is even harder.	Wannan lokacin ya fi wuya.
I died watching the last one.	Na mutu ina kallon na ƙarshe.
I have no doubt he will lose sleep over it.	Ba na shakka zai rasa barci a kan shi.
I feel like I have been missing for a long time.	Na ji an dade da bata.
He is more than happy to talk about food.	Ya fi jin daɗin magana akan abinci.
Of course she was better than planning a trip.	Tabbas ta fi shirin tafiya.
But they have nothing to lose.	Amma ba su da wani abin da za su rasa.
He says a lot.	Ya ce da yawa.
That is why they are children.	Abin da ya sa su yara ke nan.
I will not go back like that.	Ba zan koma haka ba.
That is why you will not get much.	Shi ya sa ba za ku sami da yawa ba.
It tests you.	Tana gwada ku.
True and genuine.	Gaskiya kuma ji na gaske.
This is still happening.	Wannan yana faruwa har yanzu.
So this is something new.	Don haka wannan wani sabon abu ne.
We still haven't got there.	Har yanzu ba mu isa can ba.
It's not like the rest of us.	Ba kamar sauran mu ba ne.
Many do.	Mutane da yawa suna yin hakan.
He does not want to be somewhere.	Ba ya son zama a wani wuri.
They killed each other.	Sun kashe juna.
I knew it would never work.	Na san ba zai taba yin aiki ba.
You need to try to work.	Kuna buƙatar gwada yin aiki.
I’ll let him think so, though.	Zan bar shi ya yi tunanin haka, ko da yake.
She was not a drinker.	Ba ta kasance mai sha ba.
Not much more.	Ba yawa kuma.
He really wants it needed.	Lallai yana son ana bukata.
He would never do it.	Ba zai taba yi ba.
It has been proven.	An tabbatar da shi.
I seem to have a lot to say.	Ina da alama ina da abubuwa da yawa da zan ce.
They have to travel.	Dole ne su yi tafiya.
The problem is, he can't fight.	Matsalar ita ce, ya kasa faɗa.
All is not well.	Duk bai yi kyau ba.
Leave a surprise.	Bar abin mamaki.
Money is nothing, you know.	Kudi ba komai bane, kun sani.
I'm here to fix that for you.	Ina nan don gyara muku hakan.
He could not believe it.	Ya kasa yarda yana jin haka.
It was on my head quickly.	Ya kasance a kaina da sauri.
Definitely a game.	Babu shakka yana da wasan.
The world is tired.	Duniya ta gaji.
He should have known that by now.	Ya kamata ya san cewa zuwa yanzu.
I just turned it on.	Na kunna shi kawai.
Let's go inside.	Mu shiga ciki.
The same would be true of the story.	Haka labarin zai kasance.
And we enjoyed it.	Kuma mun ji daɗi.
I plan to join him in the morning.	Ina shirin shiga tare da shi da safe.
But there is a problem with that.	Amma akwai matsala game da hakan.
However, the allegations show them.	Duk da haka, zargin ya nuna su.
I will leave it to you.	Zan bar muku shi.
She thought he would surely succeed.	Ta yi tunani tabbas zai yi nasara.
We want to be told what to do.	Muna son a gaya mana abin da za mu yi.
Anyone who has ever lived will get a good second job.	Duk wanda ya taɓa rayuwa zai sami kyakkyawan aiki na biyu.
We never knew.	Ba mu taba sani ba.
The last thing on the ball.	Abu na ƙarshe akan ƙwallon.
If the kids are out of the house, you have them.	Idan yara sun yi daga gida, kuna da su.
Some are weaker than others.	Wasu sun fi wasu rauni.
I think this method will work.	Ina tsammanin wannan hanyar za ta yi aiki.
You are all very happy.	Ku duka kun yi farin ciki sosai.
She raised her hand to him.	Ta daga masa hannu.
Otherwise you can try one now.	Idan ba haka ba kuna iya gwada ɗaya yanzu.
You are not there yet.	Ba ka can tukuna.
This should not be more than once or twice a month.	Wannan ba zai zama fiye da sau ɗaya ko sau biyu a wata ba.
But it is not.	Amma ba haka ba ne.
There is more difficulty than necessary.	Akwai wahala fiye da yadda ake bukata.
They did well in the future.	Sun yi kyau a gaba.
This work requires a lot of travel.	Wannan aikin yana buƙatar tafiya mai yawa.
So he knew what was going on.	Don haka ya san abin da ke faruwa.
You do not hear a car or a single one.	Ba ka jin mota ko guda.
They are safe.	Suna lafiya.
But that is what they did.	Amma abin da suka yi ke nan.
Expect that.	Yi tsammanin haka.
But time is ahead of us all.	Amma lokaci yana gaba da mu duka.
And now, so be it.	Kuma yanzu, haka ta kasance.
There will be a wedding, but not a happy wedding.	Za a yi bikin aure, amma ba farin bikin aure ba.
You are not well.	Ba ku da lafiya.
What is it called?	Me ake cewa.
Now, some more than others, of course.	Yanzu, wasu fiye da wasu, ba shakka.
You went to your room.	Kun tafi dakin ku.
And here's one thing everyone will really enjoy.	Kuma ga abu ɗaya da kowa zai ji daɗi sosai.
And earn money.	Kuma ku sami kuɗi.
Man cannot be what he wants to be.	Mutum ba zai iya zama abin da yake so ba.
Of course this is what is happening.	Tabbas abin da ke faruwa ke nan.
But something else.	Amma wani abu kuma.
You do not know.	Ba ku sani ba.
It makes me happier than anything.	Yana kawo mini farin ciki fiye da komai.
You brought me the right one.	Kun kawo min wanda ya dace.
Things were.	Abubuwa sun kasance.
We will help as much as we can.	Za mu taimaka yadda za mu iya.
I will miss him.	Zan rasa shi.
You may know.	Kuna iya sani.
He was almost killed.	Kusan an kashe shi.
She's just a kid.	Yaro ce kawai.
Waiting for the bus to come back.	Yana jiran motar bas da baya zuwa.
And we know it works.	Kuma mun san yana aiki.
But any adult does that.	Amma duk wani babban mutum ya yi haka.
I'm tired of it.	Na gaji da shi.
I think you want it back.	Ina tsammanin kuna so a dawo da shi.
I don’t want to think too much, either.	Ba na son yin tunani da yawa, ko.
Inhabit.	Zauna.
He is walking home.	Yana tafiya gida.
So call me.	Don haka a kira ni.
We are the only way to the end.	Mu ne kawai hanyar zuwa ƙarshe.
I want to see you.	Ina son ganin ku.
Everyone loves her.	Kowa ya so ta.
Walk slowly.	Tafiya a hankali.
This is not true, of course.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne, ba shakka.
I can go on.	Zan iya ci gaba.
I told her earlier.	Na gaya mata a baya.
We would have been happy.	Da mun yi farin ciki.
We never talked about money.	Ba mu taɓa yin magana game da kuɗi ba.
It worked instantly.	Ya yi aiki nan take.
It can only get better from here.	Yana iya samun kyau daga nan kawai.
If so, he probably did not know her well.	Idan haka ne, tabbas bai san ta sosai ba.
Maybe next time!.	Watakila lokaci mai zuwa!.
The book looks interesting.	Littafin ya duba mai ban sha'awa.
That was the only time.	Wannan shine kawai lokacin.
Interest is needed.	Ana buƙatar samun sha'awa.
He doesn't want to tell anyone.	Ba ya so ya gaya wa kowa.
This seems to interest them.	Da alama hakan yana sha'awar su.
No wonder he asked her.	Bata yi mamaki ba ya tambaye ta.
However, these things happened.	Duk da haka, waɗannan abubuwan sun faru.
They want a hand that will help them up.	Suna son hannu wanda zai taimake su sama.
Then she realized what she was seeing.	Sai ta gane me take gani.
How to bring this article	Yadda za a kawo wannan labarin
Not the way the rest of the world works.	Ba yadda sauran duniya ke aiki ba.
And never talk to them again.	Kuma kar a sake yin magana da su.
That's all.	Haka kawai .
It can be so much more.	Yana iya zama haka da yawa.
You do not have to have anything with them.	Ba lallai ne ka sami wani abu da su ba.
I want to keep doing that.	Ina so in ci gaba da yin hakan.
We know who killed them.	Mun san wanda ya kashe su.
What, still.	Menene, har yanzu.
They still have to hurry, though.	Har yanzu dole ne su yi sauri, ko da yake.
How nice that would be.	Yaya dadi hakan zai kasance.
Since then we have been playing together.	Tun daga lokacin muna wasa tare.
I was asked.	An tambaye ni.
She loves women.	Tana son mata.
They brought.	Suka kawo.
Then everything changed.	Sai komai ya canza.
But they were close.	Amma sun kasance kusa.
It does not fit the project.	Bai dace da aikin ba.
I've never been here.	Ban taba zuwa nan ba.
He knew it was true from the beginning.	Ya san gaskiya ne tun daga farko.
We stopped to look at each other.	Muka tsaya muna kallon juna.
Unlike me.	Ba kamar ni ba.
I decided to keep doing it.	Na yanke shawarar ci gaba da yi.
They told each other they loved each other.	Sun gaya wa juna suna son juna.
I can only imagine.	Ina iya tunanin kawai.
We are making the story.	Muna yin labarin.
It goes beyond that.	Ya wuce haka.
All current developments are happening here.	Duk abubuwan ci gaba na yanzu suna faruwa a nan.
Going to work is difficult.	Tafiya zuwa aiki ke da wuya.
We need to succeed.	Muna bukatar mu yi nasara.
Just to protect people.	Don kawai a kare mutane.
And he said you are still here.	Kuma ya ce har yanzu kuna nan.
He couldn't think why he wanted to talk to them.	Ya kasa tunanin dalilin da ya sa yake son yin magana da su.
We did it all in the morning.	Mun yi shi duka da safe.
She knew the way out of that place.	Ta san hanyar fita daga wannan wurin.
This house is awesome.	Wannan gidan yana da ban tsoro.
You seem to be having fun.	Kuna kamar kuna jin daɗi.
I can't figure out how we met.	Ba zan iya sanin yadda muka hadu ba.
That was before doing so.	Wannan shi ne kafin yin haka.
It is the only way to enter.	Ita ce kawai hanyar shiga.
We live with fear.	Muna rayuwa tare da jin tsoro.
And they have been using it a lot.	Kuma sun kasance suna amfani da shi sosai.
You just need to be alone.	Kuna buƙatar zama ku kawai.
Until they find a place to go.	Sai da suka samu inda za su.
And so it was.	Da haka ya kasance.
I don't get it.	Ba na samun shi.
Otherwise, you will never know what it could be.	In ba haka ba, ba za ku taɓa sanin abin da zai iya zama ba.
And in it, that book remains.	Kuma a ciki, wannan littafin ya kasance.
At the time she said little.	A lokacin ta ce kadan.
I want to add.	Ina so in kara cewa.
If she had, she would have done more to me.	Idan ta kasance, da ta kara yi min.
I'm not dead yet.	Ban mutu ba tukuna.
She can't take it.	Ba za ta iya ɗauka ba.
Of course, you can't do that.	Ba shakka, ba za ku iya yin wannan ba.
They want to know what we are doing.	Suna so su san abin da muke yi.
This will hurt.	Wannan zai yi rauni.
He’s done it before.	Ya taba yi a baya.
No one lives here now.	Babu wanda ke zaune a nan yanzu.
Maybe we.	Wataƙila mu.
No, she will have a chance.	A'a, za ta sami dama.
It just makes sense.	Abin hankali ne kawai.
Not for me, though.	Ba gare ni ba, ko da yake.
But in the future.	Amma nan gaba.
You took the wrong place.	Kun dauki wurin da bai dace ba.
I do not know how to do it.	Ban san yadda zan yi ba.
It will definitely get you ahead.	Tabbas zai ba ku gaba.
I had never heard the rest of the story.	Bata taba jin sauran labarin ba.
But there are people inside and outside others.	Amma akwai mutane a ciki da waje wasu.
Sometimes sad.	Wani lokaci abin bakin ciki.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
Yet they decided to do it somehow.	Amma duk da haka sun yanke shawarar yin hakan ta wata hanya.
Or even a month.	Ko ma wata daya.
I'm going to bring us coffee.	Zan je kawo mana kofi.
Then something changed.	Sai wani abu ya canza.
There is still no progress.	Har yanzu babu wani ci gaba.
He never came.	Bai taba zuwa ba.
Or, well, for the rest of the world.	Ko, da kyau, ga sauran duniya.
This is very enjoyable.	Wannan yana jin daɗi sosai.
You are my world.	Kai ne duniya ta.
Everyone starts somewhere.	Kowa ya fara wani wuri.
She agrees to fix the car for you.	Ta yarda ta gyara maka motar.
And he knows it's not good.	Kuma ya san abin bai yi kyau ba.
Maybe he should be killed.	Wataƙila a kashe shi.
You know you like it.	Kun san kuna son shi.
But there is nothing to do now.	Amma babu wani abin yi a kai yanzu.
She knew what she was doing.	Ta san abin da ta yi.
I can't find anything better.	Ba zan iya neman wani abu mafi kyau ba.
We will learn how to do it.	Za mu koyi yadda ake yi.
But I could not do that.	Amma ban iya yin haka ba.
You are better than I am.	Kun fi ni kyau da shi.
People will come out.	Mutane za su fito.
He said something about wanting to talk to someone.	Ya fad'a wani abu game da son magana da wani.
No one said tomorrow.	Ba wanda ya ce gobe.
I didn't think of anything.	Ban yi tunanin komai ba.
But someone will be upset at the time.	Amma wani zai damu a lokacin.
It's amazing.	Abin mamaki ne.
He had to leave it there.	Dole ne ya bar shi a can.
Do it right.	Yi shi daidai.
You can talk to the police.	Kuna iya magana da 'yan sanda.
Don't worry about anything.	Kada ku damu da komai.
We can be.	Za mu iya zama.
I will give her everything.	Zan ba ta komai.
I love it when we go out like that, the three of us.	Ina son shi lokacin da muke fita haka, mu uku.
I know how to succeed.	Na san yadda zan yi nasara.
Interesting for me.	Abin sha'awa gare ni.
That sounds like nonsense.	Wannan ya zama kamar rashin hankali.
But it is probably not as difficult as it seems.	Amma watakila ba shi da wahala kamar yadda ake gani.
He stopped somewhere near the back.	Ya tsaya wani wuri kusa da baya.
I'm not too scared.	Ba ni da tsoro sosai.
And it is not over.	Kuma bai kare ba.
I should not be surprised.	Bai kamata in yi mamaki ba.
It could have been otherwise, and it could have been otherwise.	Yana iya zama in ba haka ba, kuma da ya kasance in ba haka ba.
I'll try something once.	Zan gwada wani abu sau ɗaya.
But nothing happened.	Amma babu wani abu da ya faru.
Everyone will suffer.	Kowa zai sha wahala.
Now, though, there is a new difficulty.	Yanzu, ko da yake, an sami sabon wahala.
It's just beautiful.	Yana da kyau kawai.
I'm telling the truth.	Gaskiya nake fada.
No I don't.	A'a ba ni da.
Of course I will never get married.	Shakka ba zan taba yin aure ba.
And go.	Kuma ka tafi.
Sometimes both at the same time.	Wani lokaci duka biyu lokaci guda.
This happens twice a day.	Wannan yana faruwa sau biyu a rana.
It doesn't go well.	Ba ya tafiya da kyau.
It would have been nice if he had, but it wasn't.	Zai yi kyau idan ya yi, amma ba haka ba.
just play, just play.	wasa kawai, wasa kawai.
He told her the truth.	Ya gaya mata gaskiya.
I hope the book is good.	Ina fatan littafin ya yi kyau.
You can let them pass you by.	Kuna iya barin su su wuce ku.
But he wanted more.	Amma ya so fiye da haka.
We can't find it.	Ba za mu iya samun shi ba.
No one knew we were there.	Ba wanda ya san mun kasance a wurin.
It looks like you know you did something wrong.	Yana kama da kun san kun yi abin da bai dace ba.
The coffee itself is amazing.	Kofi da kansa yana da ban mamaki.
First, take the time to see how much food she eats.	Da farko, ɗauki lokaci don ganin yawan cin abinci da take ci.
That's how it feels.	Haka abin yake ji.
This is an interesting problem.	Wannan matsala ce mai ban sha'awa.
Now she just can't walk.	Yanzu ta kasa tafiya kawai.
In person.	A mutumin.
Think about how long it took.	Ka yi tunanin tsawon lokacin da aka yi.
Nothing is happening.	Babu wani abu da ke faruwa.
Only the first three things will be explained here.	Abubuwa uku na farko ne kawai za a bayyana a nan.
I remember hearing that in the past.	Na tuna jin haka a baya.
It's been a year since she lost.	Shekara guda kenan da rasa ta.
That is a good thing.	Wannan shine abu mai kyau.
Who told you you could get in here?	Wa ya gaya maka za ka iya shiga nan?
He wrote himself.	Da kansa ya rubuta.
I don't want anything else.	Ba na son wani abu kuma.
Buy a shirt.	Sayi rigar.
This is not a reversal.	Wannan ba koma baya ba ne.
This is the working time.	Wannan shine lokacin aiki.
You must go.	Lallai yakamata ku tafi.
He recommended a review of the program.	Ya ba da shawarar a sake duba shirin.
She wondered how we could do without her	Ta yi mamakin yadda za mu yi ba tare da ita ba
And for a while it worked.	Kuma na ɗan lokaci yana aiki.
Let it come.	Bari ya zo.
Never miss a meal.	Kada a taɓa rasa abinci.
So the story goes on.	Don haka labarin ya ci gaba.
I never said that again, no, after he told me so.	Ban sake cewa haka ba, ba kuma, bayan ya gaya mani haka.
The room is hot.	Dakin yayi zafi.
It is real life.	Rayuwa ce ta gaske.
Everything is nothing.	Komai ba komai bane.
Many are with him.	Da yawa suna tare da shi.
No one looks happy.	Babu wanda ya yi kama da farin ciki.
Things can be done quickly, they can take a week or two.	Ana iya yin abubuwa da sauri, suna iya ɗaukar mako ɗaya ko biyu.
I can't afford to use this movie.	Ba zan iya samun kuɗin da zan yi amfani da wannan fim ɗin ba.
We will be very happy.	Za mu yi farin ciki da yawa.
It's open.	An bude.
Check out this work of mine.	Duba wannan aikin nawa.
They always live for many years.	Kullum suna rayuwa shekaru da yawa.
They eat well and grow fast.	Suna cin abinci sosai kuma suna girma cikin sauri.
He loves us.	Yana son mu.
Gradually he prepared.	A hankali ya shirya.
She is waiting for an answer.	Tana jiran amsa.
Or for children.	Ko ga yara.
I found out about a week ago.	Na gano hakan kamar mako guda da ya wuce.
This will cost money.	Wannan zai kashe kudi.
There is so much to gain.	Akwai da yawa da za a samu.
Inside nothing has changed.	A ciki babu abin da ya canza.
We did the work for you.	Mun yi muku aikin.
She will pay.	Za ta biya.
He is not talking to her.	Ba magana yake mata ba.
You want to do this today.	Kuna son yin wannan a yau.
Please have someone come.	Don Allah wani ya zo.
She was not afraid to go out alone.	Bata ji tsoron fita ita kadai ba.
Exactly, one person.	Daidai, mutum ɗaya.
In fact, many, many times.	A gaskiya ma, da yawa, sau da yawa.
I say go one by one.	Ina cewa a tafi daya bayan daya.
We still have not received an answer.	Har yanzu ba mu sami amsa ba.
In fact, it can be even easier.	A gaskiya ma, yana iya zama ma sauƙi.
They walk slowly.	Suna tafiya a hankali.
It brings a sense of well-being.	Ya kawo wani jin daɗi.
When he leaves we go.	Idan ya tafi sai mu tafi.
Finally and here and now.	Ƙarshe kuma a nan da kuma yanzu.
We got up the next day.	Mun tashi kwana bayan.
Money can buy anything.	Kudi na iya siyan komai.
Imagine her dying if necessary.	Ka yi tunanin ta mutu idan dole ne.
So it 's amazing.	Don haka abin mamaki ne.
What goes in goes out one way or another.	Abin da ke shiga yana fita wata hanya ko ɗaya.
It is a cold day.	Ranar sanyi ne.
I found this works really well.	Na samu wannan yana aiki sosai.
Only once.	Sau ɗaya ne kawai.
Don't worry too much about it.	Kada ku damu da yawa game da shi.
I need you to understand that.	Ina bukata ku gane hakan.
Things you should know.	Abubuwan da ya kamata ku sani.
Not for the moment.	Ba don lokacin ba.
He still won't talk to me.	Har yanzu ba zai yi magana da ni ba.
I am not a morning person.	Ni ba mutumin safe ba ne.
There are so many things you can do.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za ku iya yi.
About me, he said.	Game da ni, ya ce.
I was smart	Na kasance mai hankali
She needs others for our work.	Tana bukatar sauran don aikin mu.
Many years he had been himself.	Shekaru da yawa da ya kasance da kansa.
Think twice before acting.	Yi tunani sau biyu kafin yin aiki.
They get a lot of dog food.	Suna samun yawan abincin kare.
They are not very happy.	Ba su ji daɗi sosai ba.
The cold season is always cold here.	Lokacin sanyi koyaushe yana sanyi a nan.
Not taken.	Ba a dauka ba.
Let it come to you.	Bari ya zo gare ku.
As in the end.	Kamar yadda aka yi a ƙarshe.
I should have succeeded.	Ya kamata in yi nasara.
It is usually made by hand.	An fi yin shi da hannu.
I did not hear that.	Ban ji haka ba.
But she worries that this is too much.	Amma ta damu cewa wannan ya yi yawa.
That will take time.	Hakan zai dauki lokaci.
I don't like them anymore.	Ba na son su kuma.
You will.	Za ku.
No problem.	Ba shi da matsala.
I like these things too.	Ina son waɗannan abubuwan kuma.
They go very well.	Suna tafiya sosai da kyau.
Of course I will return to this place.	Tabbas zan dawo wannan wurin.
It's about being the best, compare yourself to others.	Yana da game da zama mafi kyau, gwada kanku da wasu.
Don't look the other way.	Kar ku kalli wata hanya.
You can't leave us.	Ba za ku iya barin mu ba.
A person who is planning to commit suicide can offer his or her favorite things.	Mutumin da ke shirin kashe kansa na iya ba da abubuwan da ya fi so.
You still love it.	Har yanzu kuna son shi.
They lost nothing.	Ba su ƙara rasa komai ba.
And he knew that was fine.	Kuma ya san cewa lafiya.
It kills him.	Yana kashe shi.
But it’s not about it.	Amma ba game da shi ba ne.
And don't hit them too.	Kuma kar ku buga su ma.
Maybe even women.	Watakila har da mata.
Great for just the two of us.	Yayi girma ga mu biyu kawai.
It can make things like this happen.	Zai iya sa abubuwa kamar haka su faru.
But that was too much for him.	Amma wannan ya yi masa yawa.
The unknown felt close.	Abin da ba a sani ba ya ji kusa.
First, the name of the project is incorrect.	Na farko, sunan aikin ba daidai ba ne.
Whenever she used to wear a wet suit.	A duk lokacin da ta kasance tana sa rigar rigar.
He knew something was wrong with me.	Ya san wani abu bai dace da ni ba.
I don't know how to deal with it.	Ban san yadda zan yi da shi ba.
And he probably knows how to use it.	Kuma tabbas ya san yadda ake amfani da shi.
And after that, she never stopped hearing it.	Kuma bayan, ba ta daina jin shi ba.
But this is something new.	Amma wannan sabon abu ne.
You need it now, and you need it quickly.	Kuna buƙatar shi yanzu, kuma kuna buƙatar shi da sauri.
I love this article.	Ina son wannan labarin.
You will know it.	Za ku san shi.
But he died.	Amma ya mutu.
In a few years that will be me.	A cikin ƴan shekaru hakan zai zama ni.
I even stopped.	Har ma na tsaya.
But that is not what it says.	Amma ba haka yake cewa ba.
I am very focused.	Ina mai da hankali sosai.
If needed you are wanted.	Idan ana bukata ana son ku.
You would not meet this person for lunch.	Da ba za ku hadu da wannan mutumin don cin abincin rana ba.
It has been shown to make people happy and healthy.	An nuna cewa yana sa mutane farin ciki da lafiya.
But this problem persists.	Amma wannan matsalar ta ci gaba.
That worked out well for us.	Hakan ya yi mana amfani sosai.
And it's not hard to find.	Kuma bai yi wuya a samu ba.
They stopped talking.	Suka tsaya suna magana.
And it won't.	Kuma ba zai yi ba.
He picked it up and left quickly.	Ya d'auka ya tafi da sauri.
You have to make sure you get your way home again.	Dole ne ku tabbatar da cewa kun sake samun hanyar gida.
And she laughed, as they did.	Sai ta yi dariya, kamar yadda suka yi.
They even succeeded.	Har ma sun yi nasara.
They could not remove me.	Ba su iya cire ni ba.
It feels like nothing to do.	Yana jin kamar babu abin yi.
This should not happen.	Wannan bai kamata ya faru ba.
Immediately it was not enough.	Nan da nan bai isa ba.
These are the best they have ever done.	Waɗannan su ne mafi kyawun da suka taɓa yi.
I can do it better than you.	Zan iya yin shi fiye da ku.
He says a lot.	Ya ce da yawa.
Sorry for all that, you know.	Yi hakuri da duk wannan, ka sani.
Dinner and child care will be provided.	Za a ba da abincin dare da kula da yara.
Must be paid.	Dole ne a biya.
Suddenly they realized he could not.	Nan da nan suka gane ba zai iya ba.
It’s something we did.	Wani abu ne da muka yi.
Do you agree with me?	Kun yarda da ni?.
Should take advantage of growth opportunities.	Kamata yayi yayi amfani da damar girma.
Not all work.	Ba duka aikin ba ne.
He can show her.	Zai iya nuna mata.
This seems to be given to us.	Wannan kamar an ba mu ne.
She looked at the rest.	Ta kalli sauran.
The work is amazing.	Aikin yana da ban mamaki.
I did not.	Ban yi haka ba.
It will not be sold.	Ba za a sayar da shi ba.
No one really cared.	Babu wanda ya kula sosai.
That's what everyone is going to talk about.	Abin da kowa zai yi magana a kai ke nan.
You can find it here.	Kuna iya samun shi a nan.
I love all of this, too.	Ina son duk wannan, kuma.
This is the best thing.	Wannan shine mafi kyawun abu.
I can not see why anyone would do that.	Ba zan iya ganin dalilin da zai sa kowa zai yi haka ba.
Growth can be seen this year.	Ana iya ganin girma a wannan shekara.
Just there.	Kawai can.
And all your way.	Da duk ku hanya.
It is not as good as everyone says.	Ba shi da kyau kamar yadda kowa ya ce.
He does not belong to this world.	Shi ba na wannan duniya ba ne.
I'll try that.	Zan gwada hakan.
No one wants to do that.	Babu wanda yake son yin hakan.
It really has it all.	Da gaske yana da shi duka.
Sometimes she smokes with him.	Wani lokaci tana shan taba tare da shi.
I have no money, no place to go.	Ba ni da kuɗi, babu wurin zuwa.
Less than a week before the trip.	Kasa da mako guda kafin tafiya.
It should be fixed.	Ya kamata a gyara shi.
He must find a place to eat.	Dole ne ya sami wurin da zai ci.
No wonder it looks so familiar.	Ba mamaki ya yi kama da saba.
I met some women.	Na hadu da wasu mata.
It is not difficult.	Ba shi da wahala.
See for yourself.	Duba da kanku.
Two people killed him.	Mutane biyu, sun kashe shi.
Maybe readers have some thoughts ?.	Wataƙila masu karatu suna da wasu tunani?.
It's enough now.	Ya isa yanzu.
I was sick for three days.	Na yi rashin lafiya kwana uku.
We got there early to talk.	Mun isa can da wuri don yin magana.
I never missed it.	Ban taba rasa shi ba.
So she signed.	Don haka ta sa hannu.
He would never accept a will.	Ba zai taɓa yarda da son rai ba.
She has amazing equipment.	Tana da kayan aiki mai ban mamaki.
About a lot of things.	Game da abubuwa da yawa.
No one wants to be that person.	Ba wanda yake so ya zama wannan mutumin.
And he will bring you back home.	Kuma zai dawo da ku gida.
And many kids love it.	Kuma yara da yawa suna son yin hakan.
This room is the perfect place to study.	Wannan dakin shine wurin da ya dace don yin karatu.
The material has been widely used.	An yi amfani da abu sosai.
It makes life a little easier.	Yana sa rayuwa ta ɗan sauƙi.
She did it.	Ta yi shi.
You must start eating.	Dole ne ku fara cin abinci.
But he could not stop thinking about it.	Amma ya kasa daina tunanin hakan.
That should be commendable.	Hakan ya dace da sha'awa tun.
Of course he did.	Tabbas ya yi.
He did not know that.	Bai san da haka ba.
Grow up, get up.	Girma, tashi.
It is required.	Ana bukata.
You can talk to me.	Kuna iya magana da ni.
Why is this happening to us?	Me yasa hakan ke faruwa da mu?
I will kill everyone.	Zan kashe kowa.
Someone has to do it.	Dole ne wani ya yi.
I think he was in it.	Ina tsammanin ya kasance a ciki.
Not a little bit.	Ba kadan kadan ba.
And he knew it was wrong, too.	Kuma ya san ba daidai ba ne, ma.
He did not say what.	Bai ce me ba.
I walked fast.	Na yi tafiya da sauri.
Maybe he was just himself.	Wataƙila ya kasance kansa kawai.
However, time has passed.	Duk da haka, lokaci ya wuce.
Two.	Biyu.
They made a mistake, however.	Sun yi kuskure, duk da haka.
I didn't even know you had a car.	Ban ma san kana da mota ba.
They do not care what is needed to get it.	Ba su damu da abin da ake bukata don samun shi ba.
Big mistake not to.	Babban kuskure ba don.
I said sit down.	Na ce a zauna.
You are sleeping well.	Kuna barci sosai.
But she has to do it.	Amma dole ta yi hakan.
He will definitely read well.	Tabbas tabbas zai yi karatu mai kyau.
He can not.	Ba zai iya ba.
Very nice.	Yi kyau sosai.
Past and present and future too.	Na baya da na yanzu da na gaba ma.
The money stops here.	Kuɗin ya tsaya a nan.
But it is still early.	Amma yana da wuri tukuna.
The world is not enough, they say, to take everyone.	Duniya ba ta isa ba, in ji su, don ɗaukar kowa.
You do not have them.	Ba ku da su.
There is not much time left for us.	Babu sauran lokaci da yawa a gare mu.
The same is true now.	Haka abin yake a yanzu.
I asked myself.	Na tambayi da kaina.
It is true, like life.	Gaskiya ne, kamar rayuwa.
They know it.	Sun san shi.
Everyone should know this.	Ya kamata kowa ya san wannan.
He was a favorite son.	Ya kasance dan da aka fi so.
We have to go back.	Dole ne mu koma.
They all sat down.	Gaba daya suka zauna.
It is better to bring them back.	Da kyau a dawo da su.
You need more.	Kuna buƙatar ƙarin.
How are you going.	Yaya za ku je.
And happy about it.	Kuma farin ciki game da shi.
He does not want to be here.	Ba ya son zama a nan.
See, you like it or not.	Duba, kuna so ko a'a.
I'm back now.	Na dawo yanzu.
Nothing called her.	Ba komai ya kira ta ba.
He would never catch himself, of course.	Ba zai taba kama kansa ba, ba shakka.
The object is in the room with us.	Abu yana cikin dakin tare da mu.
Have you finished your homework?	Kun gama da aikin gida?
It must be difficult.	Dole ne ya zama mai wahala.
Everyone saw what happened, but no one helped.	Kowa ya ga abin da ya faru, amma babu wanda ya taimaka.
I study at work.	Ina karatu a wurin aiki.
I will never be able to touch her.	Ba zan taba iya taba ta ba.
But that was only later.	Amma hakan ya bayyana ne daga baya.
He was like a child.	Ya kasance kamar yaro.
However it can be left until then.	Duk da haka ana iya barin shi har zuwa lokacin.
But that is not the case.	Amma shi ma ba haka bane.
I don’t have it yet, but it’s on the way.	Ba ni da shi tukuna, amma yana kan hanya.
He held another ‘meeting,’ as he called it, with the police.	Ya sake yin wani 'taron,' kamar yadda ya kira shi, tare da 'yan sanda.
Then no one spoke again.	Daga nan babu wanda ya sake magana.
But that did not stop him.	Amma hakan bai sa shi kuskure ba.
He recognized them all.	Ya gane su duka.
And play well.	Kuma wasa da kyau.
I think he was alone.	Ina tsammanin shi kadai ne.
He parked the car and drove past.	Ya ajiye motar ya wuce.
No more heat.	Babu sauran zafi.
The things we are told to fear are not what we should be afraid of.	Abubuwan da ake gaya mana mu ji tsoro ba su ne ya kamata mu ji tsoro ba.
Of course, why not.	Tabbas, me yasa ba.
It is a fact of life.	Gaskiya ce ta rayuwa.
Who does not exist.	Wanda babu shi.
He really took care of her.	Da gaske ya kula da ita.
However, he refused.	Duk da haka, ya ƙi yarda.
But there is one problem.	Amma akwai matsala daya.
But the real problem starts here.	Amma ainihin matsala ta fara a nan.
He decided completely.	Ya yanke shawarar gaba daya.
No one looked anymore.	Babu wanda ya kara kallon.
It made me even happier.	Ya kara min dadi.
These are good things.	Waɗannan abubuwa ne masu kyau.
I was so sad.	Na wuce bakin ciki.
The problem is as follows.	Matsalar ita ce kamar haka.
I'll go inside.	Zan shiga ciki.
No, no, not that person.	A'a, a'a, ba wannan mutumin ba.
And you're right.	Kuma kun yi daidai.
I suggest we take it.	Ina ba da shawarar mu ɗauka.
It can be one of the first one or two.	Zai iya zama ɗaya daga cikin na farko ɗaya ko biyu.
He too got it.	Shi ma ya samu.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
I can't feel that.	Ba zan iya jin haka ba.
But you can see.	Amma kuna iya gani.
So, I don't know what to do.	Don haka, ban san abin da zan yi ba.
Whatever you see, do not tell me.	Duk abin da kuka gani, kada ku gaya mani.
But it is still scary.	Amma har yanzu yana da ban tsoro.
Probably the last.	Wataƙila na ƙarshe.
That never happened.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
I want to do good to him.	Ina so in yi masa kyau.
There are so many.	Akwai mutane da yawa.
When is the best time to do this?	Yaushe ne lokaci mafi kyau don yin wannan?
Everyone this is the best person.	Kowa wannan shine mafi kyawun mutum.
You hear me say it all the time.	Kuna ji na faɗa koyaushe.
', he was'.	', ya kasance'.
I'll call the police.	Zan kira 'yan sanda.
When they do, it’s fine.	Lokacin da suka yi, yana da kyau.
I still do not know.	Har yanzu ban sani ba.
It will come out eventually.	Za ta fito a ƙarshe.
No one did that.	Babu wanda ya yi hakan.
And it doesn't lie to me.	Kuma bata min karya.
I decided to work on my own.	Na yanke shawarar yin aiki da kaina.
Just a little bit.	Kadan kawai.
We do not need to help you again.	Ba ma buƙatar sake taimaka muku.
Some of them are made of other materials.	Wasu daga ciki an yi su da wasu abubuwa.
Great comedy.	Babban abin ban dariya.
But we were about to be arrested.	Amma an kusa kama mu a lokacin.
It was never done.	Ba a taɓa yin sa ba.
No one wanted to leave me alone, not even me.	Ba wanda ya so ya bar mu ni kaɗai, har ma da ni.
That takes care of that.	Wannan yana kula da hakan.
World interest.	Sha'awar duniya.
Not after what happened.	Ba bayan abin da ya faru ba.
Really good book.	Gaskiya mai kyau littafin.
Running is not what he did.	Gudu ba abin da ya yi ba ne.
Maybe if she let him out.	Watakila idan ta bari ya fita.
People are being arrested.	Ana kama mutane.
I didn't think so.	Ban yi tunanin hakan ba.
You have to expect that.	Dole ne ku yi tsammanin hakan.
A little sad.	Dan bakin ciki.
There will be no problem.	Ba za a sami matsala ba.
Now there is no house.	Yanzu babu gidan.
Maybe he's back now.	Wataƙila ya dawo yanzu.
I do not know where to go from there.	Ban san inda zan je daga can ba.
No one was injured.	Babu wanda ya ji rauni.
He seems to want to tell us something.	Da alama yana so ya gaya mana wani abu.
Get into it.	Shiga cikin ta.
This is amazing, right? 	Wannan abin ban mamaki ne, dama?
He needs us, and we are not doing anything to bring it back.	Yana bukatar mu, kuma ba mu yin wani abu don dawo da shi.
Lie to him.	Yi masa karya.
There is nothing he can do now.	Babu abin da zai iya yi yanzu.
Truth.	Gaskiya.
It was a wonderful time to be a kid.	Lokaci ne mai ban mamaki don zama yaro.
Save food and extra water.	Ajiye kayan abinci da ƙarin ruwan sha.
But she was disappointed.	Amma abin ya bata mata rai.
I started writing to myself again.	Na fara rubuta wa kaina kuma.
She did not go there.	Ba ta je wurin ba.
I could not find her.	Na kasa samun ta.
It's just amazing.	Abin mamaki ne kawai.
They just tell you.	Suna gaya muku kawai.
It is time to move on.	Lokaci ya yi da za a ci gaba.
One must take it.	Dole ne mutum ya ɗauka.
But no one heard.	Amma babu wanda ya ji.
But it does not seem that anything has changed.	Amma ba kamar komai ya canza ko wani abu ba.
I feel good about it.	Na ji dadi game da shi.
It's a hobby.	Sha'awa ce.
I do not know what will happen.	Ban san abin da zai faru ba.
It does not work.	Ba haka yake aiki ba.
He was considerate of you.	Ya kasance mai tunani game da ku.
Bigger than life.	Girma fiye da rayuwa.
So it went on.	Don haka abin ya ci gaba.
Everyone wants to know what this story will be like.	Duk suna son sanin yadda wannan labarin zai kasance.
I have three children.	Ina da yara uku.
She is unemployed and wants to travel.	Ba ta da aiki kuma tana son tafiya.
Something no one else can do here.	Wani abu da babu wani mutum a nan zai iya yi.
This will get you right.	Wannan zai kai ku daidai.
She feels very tired.	Ta ji ' ta gaji sosai.
That's it, not so.	Shi ke nan, ba haka ba.
When she does not want to be saved.	Lokacin da ba ta so a ajiye ta.
Another thought occurred.	Wani tunani ne ya faru.
This person must be in a bad mood.	Dole ne wannan mutumin ya kasance ba shi da kyau.
People will talk.	Mutane za su yi magana.
About everyone and everything.	Game da kowa da komai.
I have very little food.	Ina da abinci kaɗan.
It's so amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki sosai.
She understood a little.	Ta fahimci kadan.
You must go into debt to buy a car.	Dole ne ku shiga bashi don siyan mota.
If not.	Idan kuma ba haka ba .
They have three children sitting.	Suna da yara uku a zaune.
I have never used one.	Ban taba amfani da daya ba.
In fact, they did not come out and tell me.	A gaskiya ba su fito sun gaya mani ba.
We use a lot of fat every year.	Muna amfani da mai mai yawa kowace shekara.
For this, it is considered symbolic.	Don wannan, ana ɗaukar ta alama ce.
I went there and I did.	Na je can kuma na yi haka.
But maybe, he said, it's time to change that.	Amma watakila, in ji shi, lokaci ya yi da za a canza hakan.
Today is our day.	Yau ce ranar mu.
And you can not look inside.	Kuma ba za ku iya duba ciki ba.
He just needs the right time.	Ya kawai bukatar lokacin da ya dace.
God, it hurts.	Allah, abin ya yi zafi.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
There are so many more than us.	Akwai su da yawa fiye da mu.
For some, it will be all.	Ga wasu, zai zama duka.
More than they seem to be playing.	Fiye da kamar suna wasa.
Almost easy money.	Kusan kuɗi mai sauƙi.
The rain continued throughout the night.	An ci gaba da ruwan sama har tsawon dare.
We can confirm its use now.	Za mu iya tabbatar da amfani da shi a yanzu.
It started to rain we arrived.	An fara ruwan sama muna isa.
There is no doubt about that.	Babu shakka akan hakan.
She can't do anything.	Ba za ta iya yin wani abu ba.
I stood on the standing water.	Na tsaya a kan ruwan da ya tsaya.
We should look at it, but not now.	Ya kamata mu duba shi, amma ba yanzu ba.
I can't find it to work for me.	Ba zan iya samun shi ya yi mini aiki ba.
What should we do to get involved.	Me ya kamata mu yi don shiga ciki.
I love it so much!	Ina son shi sosai!
Nothing easy here.	Babu wani abu mai sauƙi a nan.
They need us and we need them.	Suna bukatar mu kuma muna bukatar su.
Hope you are well.	Da fatan kuna lafiya.
And they are.	Kuma su ne.
Best to give myself up for more heat.	Mafi kyawun ba da kaina don ƙarin zafi.
Leave me the story.	Bar min labarin.
Three beautiful children.	Yara masu kyau uku.
But she never made a mistake.	Amma bata taba yin kuskure ba.
That made me laugh.	Hakan ya sa ya kara min dariya.
Please let us be.	Don Allah bari mu kasance.
We waited until she got home to find another dog.	Mun jira har ta isa gida ta sami wani kare.
Somewhere in her, she knew it was not true.	Wani wuri a cikin ta, ta san ba gaskiya ba ne.
All items used carefully.	Duk abubuwan da aka yi amfani da su a hankali.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Wataƙila, watakila, watakila.
And they had children.	Sai suka samu yara.
You will not laugh.	Ba za ku yi dariya ba.
On that note, we agree.	A kan haka, mun yarda.
I was one.	Na kasance daya.
Maybe, one day or another, he thought to himself.	Watakila, wata rana ko dare, ya yi tunani da kansa.
Now, don't worry about me.	Yanzu, kada ku damu da ni.
Something funny.	Wani abin ban dariya.
I did not find any.	Ban sami ko ɗaya ba.
The dinner was delicious.	Abincin dare yayi dadi.
Amazing things have happened here.	Abubuwa masu ban mamaki sun faru a nan.
He does not like drink or food.	Ba ya son abin sha ko abinci.
It does not surprise me.	Ba ya bani mamaki.
I want to travel the world.	Na so tafiya duniya.
But it is.	Amma shi ne.
But now he has failed.	Amma yanzu ya kasa.
Nothing beats instant gratification.	Babu wani abu da ke kallon sha'awa nan take.
I hope she does.	Ina fatan cewa ta yi.
We know you.	Mun san ku.
Drinking coffee seems to make people happy.	Shan kofi da alama yana sa mutane farin ciki.
Not that these are exactly the same thing, though.	Ba cewa waɗannan su ne ainihin abu ɗaya ba, ko da yake.
She is not afraid.	Bata ji tsoro ba.
I do not know why he did not.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa bai yi ba.
Be prepared for that.	A shirya don haka.
He speaks very slowly.	Yana magana a hankali a hankali.
I can do it alone.	Zan iya yin shi ni kaɗai.
What good has it done?	Wane amfani ne ya taɓa yi?.
This is true for everyone.	Wannan gaskiya ne ga kowa da kowa.
When he spoke again she thought they were going to kill her.	Da ya sake magana sai ta yi tunanin tabbas za su kashe ta.
But that's not true, perhaps.	Amma ba haka ba ne a gaskiya, watakila.
If a mistake is made how much.	Idan aka yi kuskure nawa ne.
He was not surprised.	Ba a ba shi mamaki ba.
The things they said they thought she could use.	Abubuwan da suka ce suna tsammanin za ta iya amfani da su.
That's the way it is.	Haka abin yake.
Now it would be better.	Yanzu zai fi kyau.
This will make the big day even more enjoyable.	Wannan zai sa rana mai girma ta fi dadi.
So it kills us.	Haka yake kashe mu.
People often find people.	Sau da yawa 'yan sanda suna gano mutane.
I wonder how you feel.	Ina mamakin yadda kuke ji.
I like to take when people come.	Ina son dauki lokacin da mutane suka zo.
No, you might as well give up.	A'a, watakila gara ka bari.
That is what we want now.	Abin da muke so ke nan a yanzu.
I do not know what is going on.	Ban san me ke faruwa ba.
Often, in fact.	Sau da yawa, a gaskiya.
What is happening to me? 	Me ke faruwa da ni?
I do not want to hear.	Ban son ji.
You must want to do it.	Dole ne ku so ku yi.
I heard everything they said.	Na ji duk abin da suka ce.
We get a lot of help every year.	Muna samun taimako da yawa a kowace shekara.
She went back and sat down.	Ta koma ta zauna.
We want him to go.	Muna son ya tafi.
I think, finally, the time has come.	Ina tsammanin, a ƙarshe, lokaci ya yi.
Let us not waste food.	Kada mu bata abinci.
I didn’t think it would work but it does.	Ban yi tsammanin zai yi aiki ba amma yana yi.
He will do nothing.	Ba zai yi komai ba.
No answer.	Babu amsa.
It's about work.	Yana da game da aiki.
Just start with it.	Kawai fara da shi.
Maybe we will.	Wataƙila za mu yi.
He knew she was right.	Ya san ta yi gaskiya.
Can you hear?	Za ku iya ji?
But, that is what it is.	Amma, shi ne abin da yake.
Maybe I will never see one.	Wataƙila ba zan taɓa ganin ɗaya ba.
I looked at them and asked who the man was.	Na duba su na tambayi mutumin nawa ne.
But she had to go.	Amma dole ta tafi.
She did not know what to write.	Abin da za ta rubuta ba ta sani ba.
He tried to help.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya taimaka.
Of course he is happy.	Tabbas yana farin ciki.
Don't go outside.	Bata zuwa waje.
That's how we lived at the time.	Haka muka yi rayuwa a lokacin.
Call if prepared.	Kira idan an shirya.
Everyone is talking.	Kowa yana magana.
It's too hot.	Yayi zafi sosai.
Must talk to.	Dole ne yayi magana da.
Let's try it now.	Bari mu gwada shi yanzu.
And it will probably make you cut a lot.	Kuma tabbas zai sa ku yanke da yawa.
It was a happy time.	Lokacin farin ciki ne.
No one should be like that.	Babu wanda ya isa ya zama haka.
This is one of the last.	Wannan yana daya daga cikin na ƙarshe.
It's too loose.	Ya fad'a sosai.
I wondered why.	Na sha mamakin dalilin da yasa.
So we enjoyed working together.	Don haka mun ji daɗin yin aiki tare.
They feel as comfortable as we do.	Suna jin daɗi kamar yadda muke yi.
They talk as if they are not there.	Suna magana kamar ba su ma can.
She will wait until she knows for sure.	Zata jira sai ta sani tabbas.
What a good name.	Wane suna mai kyau.
It will not work otherwise.	Ba zai yi aiki ba in ba haka ba.
There is nothing better to do.	Babu wani abu mafi kyau a yi.
Maybe she prefers to go.	Wataƙila ta fi son tafiya.
We will try this next time.	Za mu gwada hakan lokaci na gaba.
He also wanted me. 	Shi ma ya so ni. 
He will not kill me.	Ba zai kashe ni ba.
But the story did not come as a big surprise.	Amma labarin bai zo da wani babban abin mamaki ba.
One has to be careful.	Dole ne mutum ya yi hankali.
It doesn't matter.	Bata damu ba.
There are so many things.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa.
First, cold water.	Na farko, ruwan sanyi.
Our chances are not good.	Damar mu ba ta da kyau.
This speaks for itself.	Wannan yana magana da kansa.
If they can, we can too.	Idan za su iya, mu ma za mu iya.
So off they went.	Haka aka ci gaba da tafiya.
Some interesting things there.	Wasu abubuwa masu ban sha'awa a can.
But it is a good opportunity to miss.	Amma dama ce mai kyau da za a rasa.
So sit down and check your money.	Don haka ku zauna ku duba kuɗin ku.
I can not save food.	Ba zan iya ajiye abinci ba.
I want to see you every day.	Ina son ganin ku kowace rana.
You want to be active.	Kuna so ku kasance cikin aiki.
I have a lot of pain.	Ina jin zafi mai yawa.
Or just to get to know me.	Ko don kawai ku san ni.
To appear.	Don bayyana.
So the project was a success.	Don haka aikin ya yi nasara.
I have no problem at all.	Bani da matsala ko kadan.
She doesn't have it.	Ba ta da shi.
It would be wrong to say something.	Zai ji ba daidai ba a ce wani abu.
Certainly not when there is so much to break oneself.	Tabbas ba lokacin da akwai abubuwa da yawa don karya kansa ba.
You feel good no matter what you do.	Kuna jin daɗi ko da menene kuke yi.
I often use this method to get it quickly and easily.	Sau da yawa ina amfani da wannan hanyar don samun shi cikin sauri da sauƙi.
I know you know how.	Na san ka san yadda.
Help me out of this.	Ka taimake ni daga wannan.
I thought you were someone else.	Na dauka kai wani ne.
It has many benefits.	Yana da amfani da yawa.
So our population is fast food.	Don haka yawan mu shine abinci mai sauri.
Maybe we should go.	Watakila mu yi tafiya.
You just have no idea.	Ba ku da tunani kawai.
It is not common.	Ba na kowa ba ne.
But that is not all.	Amma ba wannan kaɗai ba.
Does anyone know where this is being sold?	Akwai wanda ya san inda ake sayar da wannan?.
There is no need to doubt.	Babu bukatar shakka.
The man thought, slowly.	Mutumin yayi tunani, a hankali.
It makes life easier.	Yana sa rayuwa ta fi sauƙi.
It is something we live with all the time.	Abu ne da muke rayuwa da shi kullum.
Some are harder than others.	Wasu suna da wuya fiye da wasu.
Come to one task or several.	Ku zo zuwa aiki ɗaya ko da yawa.
Years like they go fast.	Shekaru kamar suna tafiya da sauri.
They told me.	Sun so ni.
She saw that she had made a mistake.	Ta ga ta yi kuskure.
And you don't have to help me.	Kuma ba lallai ne ku taimake ni ba.
It has never been done.	Ba a taba yin sa ba.
There is no way we can win two there.	Babu yadda za mu yi nasara biyu a can.
However she could not make a mistake.	Duk da haka ba za ta iya yin kuskure ba.
There was nothing that she did to cause it.	Ba abin da ta yi ya sa ta ji daɗi.
If he should run.	Idan ya kamata ya gudu.
And that is enough.	Kuma hakan ya isa.
I asked him, and he said he wanted to do it.	Na tambaye shi, sai ya ce yana so ya yi.
This should not come as a surprise.	Wannan bai kamata ya zo da mamaki ba.
Please don't kill me.	Don Allah kar a kashe ni.
It’s time to just say no.	Lokaci ya yi da za a ce kawai, a'a.
She was very excited about things.	Ta ji daɗi sosai game da abubuwa.
This is amazing.	Wannan abin ban mamaki ne.
They asked me.	Suka tambaye ni.
Or so it appears.	Ko haka ya bayyana.
We need to learn to play it safe.	Muna bukatar mu koyi wasa da shi lafiya.
Or never did.	Ko ya taba yi.
You have money.	Kuna da kuɗi.
He took over the job with pleasure.	Ya d'auka kan aikin da jin dad'i.
He knows her well.	Ya san ta sosai.
We need them and they need us.	Muna bukatar su kuma suna bukatar mu.
I don’t know if it’s ever been done before.	Ban sani ba ko an taba yi a baya.
Let’s do something, how.	Mu yi wani abu, ta yaya.
I remember a little bit of the event.	Na tuna kadan daga cikin taron.
I can get close to them.	Zan iya zuwa kusa da su.
I remember the meeting well.	Na tuna da taron da kyau.
After that, it was only for a short time.	Bayan haka, na ɗan lokaci ne kawai.
It's just bigger.	Ya fi girma kawai.
I have to stop.	Dole na tsaya.
You cannot be mine.	Ba za ku iya zama nawa ba.
You definitely need to try these.	Lallai kuna buƙatar gwada waɗannan.
And make sure there is plenty of oil.	Kuma a tabbata akwai mai ko mai da yawa.
We don’t need to fight twice even though we do.	Ba mu buƙatar faɗa sau biyu ko da yake mun yi.
I can't just feel that.	Ba zan iya jin haka kawai ba.
So she waited until he was safe.	Don haka sai ta jira har sai ya tafi lafiya.
He waits on the bus.	Yana jira a bas.
It would be better if you did not.	Zai fi kyau idan ba ku yi ba.
I can't, man.	Ba zan iya ba, mutum.
Then hit save.	Sai buga ajiye.
To something.	Zuwa wani abu.
He wondered how she would feel today.	Yayi mamakin yadda zata ji yau.
You will not want to miss this.	Ba za ku so ku rasa wannan ba.
So we get the following things.	Don haka za mu sami abubuwa masu zuwa.
I did both.	Na yi duka biyu.
He pretended not to eat.	Ya yi kamar bai ci abinci ba.
He doesn't tell me anything.	Ba ya gaya mani komai.
No one knows her.	Ba wanda ya san ta.
I just	Ina kawai
Truth, as it were, is one.	Gaskiya, kamar yadda yake, ɗaya ne.
I don’t prepare them often.	Ba na shirya su sau da yawa.
They have no children.	Ba su da 'ya'ya.
And there are still a few more things to do.	Kuma har yanzu akwai sauran ƙarin abubuwa kaɗan.
Give them money carefully.	Ku ba su kuɗi a hankali.
You live in it.	Kuna zaune a ciki.
He liked your story.	Da ya so labarin ku.
It works really well.	Yana aiki sosai.
He is back.	Ya dawo kenan.
Nothing to prepare.	Babu abin da za a shirya.
I do that.	Ina yin haka.
It hurts.	Ya yi zafi.
That is one dinner.	Abincin dare ɗaya kenan.
He still wants to be in the action.	Har yanzu yana so ya kasance cikin aikin.
We don’t have the time we need.	Ba mu da lokacin da muke bukata.
Maybe after all this time it finally changed.	Wataƙila bayan duk wannan lokacin yana ƙarshe ya canza.
Yet we know very little about him.	Amma duk da haka mun san kadan game da shi.
Learn from them.	Koyi da su.
I was the only one who got something.	Ni kadai na sami wani abu.
I know him very well.	Na san shi sosai.
They were very happy and they enjoyed meeting us there.	Abin farin ciki ne sosai kuma sun ji daɗin samun mu a wurin.
Run faster to read the best.	Gudu da sauri don karanta mafi kyau.
But so it was.	Amma haka ya kasance.
And there are others, of course.	Kuma akwai wasu, ba shakka.
They can't just.	Ba za su iya kawai ba.
I’m not sure if these go together or not.	Ban tabbata ba idan waɗannan suna tafiya tare ko a'a.
You need to be careful, do not rush.	Kuna buƙatar yin hankali, kada ku yi sauri da sauri.
Now we look at the second.	Yanzu mun duba na biyu.
Not what we said.	Ba abin da muka ce ba.
Everything is ready.	An shirya komai.
But there is such a problem.	Amma akwai matsala irin wannan.
I have to do it.	Dole ne in yi shi.
But it does not fit.	Amma bai dace ba.
It's bigger, more amazing.	Ya fi girma, ban mamaki.
This must feel good.	Wannan dole ya ji dadi.
It needs food to feel good and to get a job.	Yana buƙatar cin abinci don jin daɗi kuma don samun aiki.
She ate lunch.	Ta ci abincin rana.
You are not there.	Ba ka can.
It has always been a tool.	Ya kasance kayan aiki koyaushe.
This will make them visible, but it also protects them.	Wannan zai sa su gani, amma kuma yana kare su.
They are not married yet, but he is very much there.	Ba su yi aure ba tukuna, amma yana can sosai.
People have always been very interested in this.	Mutane sun kasance suna sha'awar wannan sosai.
Only when you are.	Kawai a lokacin da kuke.
Making lunch is easy, she said.	Yin abincin rana yana da sauƙi, in ji ta.
And he did not know.	Kuma bai sani ba.
The truth told him.	Gaskiya ta fada masa.
I want to do this right.	Ina so in yi wannan daidai.
Don't be late.	Kar ku makara.
She has no money.	Ba ta da kudi.
It seems wrong.	Ga alama ba daidai ba.
The landlord says the house is empty.	Mai gida yace gidan babu kowa.
But he must wait.	Amma dole ne ya jira.
The train station is nice.	Tashar jirgin kasa tana da kyau.
I am here to remove them.	Ina nan don cire su.
I never thought it would be such a place.	Ban taba tsammanin zai zama irin wannan wuri ba.
Seeing something is wrong.	Ganin wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
Say please.	Ka ce don Allah.
And that didn't even begin to cover him.	Kuma hakan bai ma fara rufe shi ba.
I will not be these things.	Ba zan zama waɗannan abubuwan ba.
There is something else.	Akwai kuma wani abu kuma.
You can cut a little if you want.	Kuna iya yanke kaɗan idan kuna so.
But do not be afraid.	Amma kada ku ji tsoro.
She did not respond immediately.	Bata bata amsa ba nan take.
Sit down next to them and let them see.	Ku zauna kusa da su, ku sa su gani.
He would not agree.	Ba zai yarda ba.
Just tell us where to send it.	Kawai gaya mana inda za mu aika.
Have you ever been to a party outside?	Shin kun taɓa zuwa bikin waje?
But tonight it gives me hope.	Amma daren yau yana ba ni fata.
They want to see what happens.	Suna son ganin abin da zai faru.
It does not look good.	Bata da kyau.
Maybe you have a job of your own.	Wataƙila kuna da aiki da kanku.
He has looked at the problem for years.	Ya kalli matsalar tsawon shekaru.
She returned here before this year.	Ta koma nan kafin bana.
All is well.	Duk yayi kyau.
They lived there for two years.	Sun zauna a wurin har tsawon shekaru biyu.
What happened here today is not a mistake.	Abin da ya faru a nan yau ba kuskure ba ne.
I sat on the floor.	Na zauna a kasa.
You will probably be arrested.	Wataƙila za a kama ku.
This is good.	Wannan yana da kyau.
How long will you go?	Har yaushe za ku tafi.
We need to change something.	Muna bukatar mu canza wani abu.
We have been asked about it many times.	An tambaye mu game da shi da yawa.
But it seems she just sat up.	Amma da alama ta dan tashi zaune.
He flew without looking at anyone.	Tashi yayi ba tare da ya kalli kowa ba.
Today, you are the only one.	Yau, kai ne kawai.
Of course, you must know that.	Tabbas, dole ne ku san hakan.
I did it anyway.	Na yi shi duk da haka.
I thought so.	Na dauka haka.
There is no way she can do it now.	Babu yadda za ta yi a yanzu.
That can change things.	Hakan na iya canza abubuwa.
I would have been upset.	Da na damu.
About where you are and where you plan to go.	Game da inda kuka kasance da kuma inda kuke shirin zuwa.
These are hard to buy.	Waɗannan suna da wuya a saya.
And you are probably used to it.	Kuma tabbas kun saba da hakan.
Some in this house may say that he is not well.	Wasu cikin wannan gidan na iya cewa ba shi da lafiya.
Only God knows the pain and everything we experience.	Allah kadai ya san zafi da duk abin da muka samu.
Just call us.	Kawai kira mu.
She forgot it.	Ta manta shi.
We do not know how, and we do not want to know.	Ba mu san yadda ba, kuma ba mu so mu sani.
Sometimes we just need to be reminded of this.	Wani lokaci muna bukatar kawai a tuna mana da wannan.
I had to think of everything she touched.	Dole ne in yi tunanin duk abin da ta taɓa.
But they were wrong.	Amma sun yi kuskure.
I discovered it a lot.	Na gano da shi da yawa.
It is one of a kind.	Yana da daya daga cikin irin.
Read together now.	Ku yi karatu tare yanzu.
It is nearby.	Yana nan kusa.
It feels good.	Ya ji dadi.
You talk a lot.	Kuna yawan magana.
They really failed to be easy.	Da gaske sun kasa zama da sauƙi.
In fact, we know it.	A gaskiya, mun san shi.
We don't get that anymore.	Ba ma samun hakan kuma.
He is not a child.	Shi ba yaro ba ne.
So it must be.	Don haka lallai ya kasance.
Maybe this time things will get better.	Wataƙila wannan lokacin abubuwa za su yi kyau.
He left nothing to chance.	Bai bar komai a kai ba.
That is the hope for me.	Wannan shine fata a gare ni.
This should work really well, and it does.	Wannan ya kamata ya yi aiki sosai, kuma yana yi.
Not done, of course.	Ba a gama ba, tabbas.
You can buy day or night.	Kuna iya siyan rana ko siyan dare.
This article can help you to be healthy next time.	Wannan labarin zai iya taimaka muku samun lafiya lokaci na gaba.
This will not work.	Wannan ba zai yi aiki ba.
Life is enough.	Rayuwa ta isa.
You can hear it here.	Kuna iya jin shi a nan.
He spoke.	Ya yi magana.
It happens when you suffer.	Yana faruwa lokacin da kuka sha wahala.
If you haven't, do them now.	Idan ba ku yi ba, yi su yanzu.
He did not respond immediately.	Bata amsa ba nan take.
They only wanted to sell the equipment to see if it was used.	Sun so su sayar da kayan aiki ne kawai su ga an yi amfani da su.
He did not feel very well.	Bai ji dadi sosai ba.
Sometimes good, sometimes not good.	Wani lokaci mai kyau, wani lokacin ba kyau.
There is so much to say.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a iya cewa.
So he can play with injury.	Don haka yana iya wasa da rauni.
Run hot, run cold.	Gudu zafi, gudu sanyi.
Read the article.	Karanta labarin.
They can't help him.	Ba za su iya taimaka masa ba.
I can not see why it does not work here.	Ba zan iya ganin dalilin da ya sa ba ya aiki a nan.
I corrected but it again.	Na gyara amma ya sake.
It will not be a problem.	Ba zai zama matsala ba.
And no one.	Kuma babu wani.
I don’t like things from other people.	Ba na son abubuwa daga wasu mutane.
Enough.	Ya isa.
You should kill him immediately.	Ya kamata ku kashe shi nan da nan.
You have to be happy and not be scared.	Dole ne ku yi farin ciki kada ku ji tsoro.
Like, the second way.	Kamar, hanya ta biyu.
There is nothing that can help me.	Babu wani abu da zai iya taimaka mini.
He can make mistakes about everything.	Zai iya yin kuskure game da komai.
Nothing was ever said and done.	Ba a taɓa yin wani abu da faɗa.
You are reading this book.	Kuna karanta wannan littafin.
We can't.	Ba mu iya ba.
They are worried.	Sun damu.
I will do it again.	Zan sake yin hakan.
That sounds good.	Hakan yayi kyau.
But get this with the right diet, and stay behind.	Amma samun wannan tare da abincin da ya dace, kuma ku tsaya a baya.
And even if you don’t then buy.	Kuma ko da ba ka yi ba sai ka saya.
And they hated him.	Kuma sun ƙi shi.
She would say no.	Da ta ce a'a.
Life does not belong to me, it belongs to others.	Rayuwa ba ta kaina ba ce, ta wasu ce.
The house is amazing.	Gidan yana da ban mamaki.
They spoke three days ago.	Sun yi magana kwana uku da suka wuce.
You live here with him.	Kuna zaune a nan tare da shi.
He failed.	Ya kasa.
You have to play big.	Dole ne ku kunna babban.
Many people love it.	Mutane da yawa suna son shi.
He began to live with her.	Ya fara zama da ita.
Apparently after the game, it tells you something nice.	Ga alama bayan wasan, yana gaya muku wani abu mai kyau.
I failed	Na yi kasa
He is the one who says do it.	Shi ne ya ce ka yi.
I didn't even know they were there.	Ban ma san suna can ba.
We've heard that before.	Mun sha wannan magana a baya.
So that has changed.	Don haka an canza wannan.
This is not the only joy.	Wannan ba shine kawai abin farin ciki ba.
His whereabouts are unknown.	Ba a san inda yake ba.
No one can see how we suffer.	Babu wanda zai ga yadda muke shan wahala.
But it is true.	Amma gaskiya ne.
This is what we do and how we think.	Abin da muke yi da yadda muke tunani ke nan.
I'm right.	Ina da gaskiya.
Everyone wants to be around you.	Kowa yana so ya kasance a kusa da ku.
No additional water costs to be deducted.	Babu ƙarin kuɗin ruwa da za a yanke.
But you are a human being.	Amma kai mutum ne.
I've seen it before.	Na taba gani a baya.
I want to recognize him.	Ina so in gane shi.
These are not available.	Ba a samu waɗannan ba.
I passed you.	Na wuce ku.
It works.	Yana aiki.
I need to be there.	Ina bukata in kasance a wurin.
She looked up.	Ta kalli sama.
I'm probably close by.	tabbas na kusa kusa.
It was successful, though.	An yi nasara, ko da yake.
I'll wait for him there.	Zan jira shi a can.
You should be careful what you want.	Ya kamata ku yi hankali da abin da kuke so.
That is not fair.	Hakan bai dace ba.
But now, he is back.	Amma yanzu, ya dawo.
They really know what to do.	Da gaske sun san abin da za su yi.
That was my biggest fear.	Babban tsoro na kenan.
There is little for him.	Akwai kaɗan a gare shi.
Forget it, and forget that night it never happened.	Ku manta da shi, kuma ku manta wannan dare ya taɓa faruwa.
They will not touch one another.	Ba za su taɓa ko ɗaya ba.
I went to you but you did not touch me.	Na je wurin ku amma ba ku taɓa wurin ba.
It would have been rejected.	Da an ƙi shi.
Succeed, and it could be a good year.	Yi nasara, kuma yana iya zama shekara mai kyau.
Not once a year.	Ba sau ɗaya a shekara ba.
I want to add one thing though.	Ina so in ƙara abu ɗaya ko da yake.
I can't wait to see you.	Ba zan iya jira ganin ku ba.
He wants them to be healthy, healthy, and happy.	Yana son su lafiya, lafiya, da farin ciki.
You live next door.	Kuna zaune kusa da ku.
She begins to cry.	Kuka ta fara yi.
Every year was a scary one.	Duk shekara mai ban tsoro.
I didn’t think you would be interested.	Ban yi tsammanin za ku yi sha'awar ba.
It's not a good thing.	Ba abu ne mai kyau ba.
Do not be afraid!	Kada ku ji tsoro!
This is going to be a difficult day.	Wannan zai zama rana mai wahala.
That alone was interesting.	Wannan kadai ya kasance mai ban sha'awa.
In this she was right.	A cikin wannan ta yi daidai.
I do not know when or how we will get married.	Ban sani ba ko kuma yaushe za mu yi aure.
He doesn't want to talk to me.	Ba ya son magana da ni.
The seating is not comfortable.	Wurin zama babu dadi.
Some of them are too much.	Wasu daga ciki sun yi yawa sosai.
As usual, it looked really good.	Kamar yadda ya saba, ya yi kyau sosai.
He hoped she would come.	Ya yi fatan ta zo.
He loves her, he needs to touch her.	Yana son ta, yana bukatar taba ta.
That's it, boy.	Shi ke nan, yaro.
We always know when the time is near.	Mun ko da yaushe san lokacin da ya kusa.
He is not the son he needs.	Ba dan da yake bukata ba ne.
I could not believe it.	Na kasa yarda da ita.
They sleep on the floor.	Suna kwana a kasa.
I just work here.	Ina aiki a nan kawai.
You may not want to be.	Wataƙila ba za ku so zama ba.
And he doesn't want to go.	Kuma baya son tafiya.
I'm very sorry.	Ka dan yi hakuri.
It's better there.	Ya fi a can.
But nothing to see.	Amma babu abin gani.
The material is not filled with water.	Kayan bai cika ruwa ba.
And call us.	Kuma a kira mu.
For a little.	Don kadan.
But she was not, and she knew it.	Amma ba ta kasance ba, kuma ta sani.
This can be explained as follows.	Ana iya bayyana wannan kamar haka.
I have it with me.	Ina da shi tare da ni.
Everyone makes this mistake at some point.	Kowa yana yin wannan kuskure a wani lokaci.
Now is not the time to cry.	Yanzu ba lokacin tafiya kuka ba ne.
It rained a lot at night.	An yi ruwan sama mai yawa a daren.
He had to take care of her.	Dole ne ya kula da ita.
I will not ask you.	Ba zan tambaye ku ba.
And one night you drink a lot.	Kuma a wani dare ka sha da yawa.
Work with me.	Aiki tare da ni.
I wish I had told you earlier.	Da ma na fada maka a baya.
But it is good to remember sometimes.	Amma yana da kyau a tuna wani lokaci.
This may be easier for some people than for others.	Wannan yana iya zama da sauƙi ga wasu mutane fiye da wasu.
I know he only wants the best for you.	Na san yana so kawai a gare ku mafi kyau.
All on time.	Duk akan lokaci.
This is the story they want everyone to know.	Labarin da suke so kowa ya sani kenan.
Just for you.	Don ku kawai.
Not so in the plane.	Ba haka ba a cikin jirgin sama.
We usually eat twice a day.	Kullum muna ci sau biyu a rana.
Change oil immediately.	Canza mai nan da nan.
I hope you are right.	Ina fatan kun yi gaskiya.
It came out well.	Ya fito da kyau.
Make sure you don't tell him.	Ka tabbata ba za ka gaya masa ba.
And no one heard anything.	Kuma ba wanda ya ji komai.
He can feel that way.	Zai iya jin haka sosai.
The rain is coming and going.	Ruwan sama yana zuwa ya tafi.
She is still unsure about it.	Har yanzu ba ta da tabbas game da shi.
Remember who you were as a child.	Ka tuna wanda kuka kasance a lokacin yaro.
We are in one now.	Muna cikin daya yanzu.
It’s amazing, there’s no doubt about that.	Yana da ban mamaki, babu shakka game da hakan.
I know how a person feels.	Na san yadda mutum yake ji.
I'm thinking of food.	Ina tunanin abinci.
We will not succeed.	Ba za mu yi nasara ba.
Right he was.	A dama ya kasance.
Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't work.	Wani lokaci wannan yana aiki, wani lokacin kuma wannan baya aiki.
I lost everything.	Na rasa komai.
She is not sure.	Ba ta da tabbas.
I never wanted to work for anyone.	Ban taba son yi wa wani aiki ba.
It could be better.	Zai iya zama mafi kyau.
That did a little bit.	Wannan ya yi kadan.
I don't know where we are now.	Ban san inda muke ba yanzu.
I can be	Zan iya zama
That will not be difficult to do.	Hakan ba zai yi wuya a yi ba.
Someone put a drink in it.	Wani ya saka abin sha a ciki.
I told him that until yesterday.	Na gaya masa haka sai jiya.
She will not sleep.	Ba za ta yi barci ba.
We did not kill anyone.	Ba mu kashe kowa ba.
Maybe tonight.	Wataƙila wannan daren.
So hard to find.	Don haka da wuya a gano.
It is not used for anything.	Ba a amfani da shi ba don wani abu ba.
Wherever you are, look out for yourself and pay close attention.	Duk inda kuke, duba game da ku kuma ku kula sosai.
Right one, that's it.	Dama daya, shi ke nan.
That must be a mistake.	Dole ne hakan yayi kuskure.
He had to take it slowly.	Sai da ya dauka a hankali.
Come again.	Ku zo kuma.
I already did.	Na riga na yi.
I didn’t say that to myself.	Ba na ce da ni ba.
Something is being added or not.	Ana ƙara wani abu ko a'a.
He signed again.	Ya sake sa hannu.
He got up to see us.	Ya tashi ganin mu.
I don't even think about it anymore.	Ba na ma tunanin hakan kuma.
Then everyone started doing it.	Daga nan kowa ya fara yi.
It can work again.	Zai iya sake yin aiki.
They grew up knowing each other very well.	Sun girma sun san juna sosai.
Things did not work out for me.	Abubuwa ba su yi min aiki ba.
He knows me all and accepts it.	Ya san ni duka kuma ya yarda da shi.
One can see things that are not normally seen.	Mutum na iya ganin abubuwan da ba a saba gani ba.
The night is sky.	Dare ya zama sama.
I hope you still remember me.	Ina fata har yanzu ku tuna da ni.
Added.	An kara.
Don't let them take me away again.	Kada ku sake bari su tafi da ni.
He was close to calling.	Ya kasance kusa da kira.
Strive as you live each.	Ƙoƙari kamar yadda kuke rayuwa kowace.
They will get married.	Za su yi aure.
That's how we live.	Haka muke rayuwa.
Surprisingly he didn’t remember.	Abin mamaki da bai tuna ba.
People want to finish things.	Mutane suna son gama abubuwa.
You will be fine.	Za ku kasance lafiya.
It will.	Zai yi.
I wanted to laugh at her.	Na so in yi mata dariya.
Let me talk a lot about that.	Bari in yi magana sosai game da wannan.
You have to give it to him.	Dole ne ku ba shi.
That's not it.	Ba shi ba kenan.
I am interested in such things.	Ina sha'awar irin waɗannan abubuwa.
You may need it.	Kuna iya buƙatar shi.
I'll finish.	Zan gama.
This is not only interesting, but it also works.	Wannan ba kawai mai ban sha'awa ba ne, amma har ma yana aiki.
I have little interest in the past.	Ba ni da sha'awa kadan a baya.
I think this will be very exciting.	Ina tsammanin wannan zai zama abin farin ciki sosai.
It's been three months.	Wata uku kenan.
But it certainly is not.	Amma tabbas ba haka bane.
Life goes on for a while.	Rayuwa ta dan tashi sama mana.
They are just two.	Su biyu ne kawai.
Or he may not want to know.	Ko kuma ba zai so ya sani ba.
Now we understand it from the beginning.	Yanzu mun gane shi tun daga farko.
Not a man, not a grown-up.	Ba mutum ba, bai girma ba.
And it really took off.	Kuma da gaske ya ɗauka.
She did not know how she would feel about this story.	Ba ta san yadda za ta ji game da wannan labarin ba.
There is everything there.	Akwai komai a wurin.
He plans to move on.	Yana shirin tafiya gaba.
I don’t have it better.	Ba ni da shi mafi kyau.
But it is not forgotten.	Amma ba a manta ba.
But we are here.	Amma muna nan a nan.
It is still used.	Har yanzu ana amfani.
We talked about it.	Mun yi magana game da shi.
Something strange was happening about him.	Wani abu ya zama mai ban mamaki game da shi.
Everything should work now.	Komai yakamata yayi aiki yanzu.
It was not so.	Ba haka ya kasance ba.
I talked to them, but to no avail.	Na yi magana da su, amma ba wani amfani.
However, we can work on that.	Duk da haka, za mu iya yin aiki a kan hakan.
It’s scary, and scary.	Yana da ban tsoro, kuma mai ban tsoro.
But for people, they do a lot.	Amma ga mutane, suna yin yawa.
I often hope they have.	Sau da yawa ina fata suna da.
I looked into the plan.	Na duba cikin shirin.
He did not.	Bai yi ba.
I would not say otherwise.	Ba zan fada ba idan ba haka ba.
Children must be cared for at all times.	Dole ne a kula da yara a kowane lokaci.
No it is correct.	A'a shi ne daidai.
I talk to him a lot.	Ina yi masa magana da yawa.
The plane crashed into the car.	Jirgin ya fada cikin motar.
But then the time came.	Amma sai lokacin ya zo.
But this is more than that.	Amma wannan ya fi yawa.
We are all where you are now.	Duk mun kasance inda kuke yanzu.
They describe what happened with great joy.	Sun bayyana abin da ya faru da farin ciki sosai.
I want that now.	Ina son hakan a yanzu.
Do not expect immediate success.	Kar a yi tsammanin nasara nan take.
It will be easier if you just change your name.	Zai fi sauƙi idan kun canza sunan ku kawai.
But a little bit.	Amma kadan kadan.
It is useful to know.	Abu ne mai amfani a sani.
Or it ends.	Ko kuma ya kare.
They kept going.	Suka ci gaba da tafiya.
I want to know how you are today.	Ina so in san yadda kuke a yau.
And he just got up from there.	Kuma kawai ya tashi daga can.
You gave us this.	Kun ba mu wannan.
I heard that.	Na ji haka.
Here is her chance.	Ga damar ta.
Just meet.	Ku hadu kawai.
Life here can be very exciting.	Rayuwa a nan na iya zama mai ban sha'awa sosai.
But there is one place we cannot go.	Amma akwai wuri daya da ba za mu iya zuwa ba.
He was crying.	Yana kuka yana kuka.
He once knew a third person.	Ya taɓa sanin mutum na uku.
She ran with him.	Ta gudu da shi.
Maybe, you don’t have what to lose.	Wataƙila, ba ku sami abin da za ku rasa ba.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
No one really understood what was going on.	Babu wanda ya fahimci ainihin abin da ke faruwa.
We didn't talk much.	Ba mu yi magana da yawa ba.
I have a month to change things.	Ina da wata guda don canza abubuwa.
Users will pay for this.	Masu amfani za su biya wannan.
Do not be surprised.	Kar ka yi mamaki.
I realized that things had to change.	Na gane cewa dole abubuwa su canza.
There is a problem and something has to change.	Akwai matsala kuma dole wani abu ya canza.
Hit me.	Buga ni.
Sometimes they are not.	Wani lokaci ba su.
I'm sure you can recognize them.	Na tabbata za ku iya gane su.
Some will not show.	Wasu ba za su nuna ba.
Think you might be interested in this.	Yi tunanin kuna iya sha'awar wannan.
It's so delicious.	Yana da dadi sosai.
I am not at home.	Bana gida.
If you do not want to, do not.	Idan ba ka so, kar ka.
For him, and for me.	Don shi, kuma a gare ni.
Eat slowly.	Ku ci a hankali.
Maybe it's the only way in and out.	Watakila ita ce kadai hanyar shiga da fita.
No, that is not true.	A'a, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
It's amazing.	Abin mamaki ne.
I can do my best.	Zan iya yin mafi kyau.
I think everyone is happy.	Ina tsammanin kowa ya ji daɗi.
That's not what happened.	Ba abin da ya faru ba kenan.
You do both.	Kuna yi duka biyu.
But they are not.	Amma ba haka suke ba.
Of course it can only do good.	Tabbas zai iya yin kyau kawai.
Without success, both ended.	Ba tare da samun nasara ba, duka biyu sun daina.
Cover and let stand until cool.	Rufe kuma bari su tsaya har sai sanyi.
Not necessarily in the palace.	Ba lallai ba ne a cikin fada.
But it does happen.	Amma ana samun haka.
Interesting.	Ban sha'awa.
And still to school.	Kuma har yanzu zuwa makaranta.
Then take them to school.	Daga nan sai ka kai su makaranta.
But they are not easy.	Amma ba su da sauƙi.
You run and they run fast.	Kuna gudu kuma suna gudu da sauri.
The water is very cold.	Ruwan yayi sanyi sosai.
What do you eat? 	Me kuke ci?
That's what I did.	Abin da na yi ke nan.
he wanted to know.	ya so ya sani.
I learned this.	Na koyi wannan.
I hope this helps.	Ina fatan wannan ya taimaka.
We should not go beyond them.	Bai kamata mu wuce su ba.
But not as people say.	Amma ba kamar yadda mutane suka ce ba.
I did not ask for anything.	Ban nemi komai ba.
I'm tired of making mistakes, she thought.	Na gaji da yin kuskure, ta yi tunani.
They are very close to each other on this development.	Sun yi kusa da juna akan wannan ci gaba.
I was the most amazing.	Na kasance mafi ban mamaki.
I know exactly where he is.	Na san ainihin inda yake.
No one said so.	Babu wanda ya ce haka.
Only one for women.	Daya na mata ne kawai.
He was in the past.	Ya kasance a baya.
I really do.	Ina da gaske.
What happened was this.	Abin da ya faru shi ne wannan.
Maybe he really got sick.	Wataƙila da gaske ya yi rashin lafiya.
So do the previous ones.	Haka kuma na baya.
The room was no longer empty.	Dakin bai ƙara zama kowa ba.
We arrived at your house.	Mun isa gidan ku.
I have to work tonight.	Dole ne in yi aiki a daren yau.
It would be like.	Zai zama kamar .
It is not something you can buy.	Ba abin da za ku iya saya ba ne.
It was a last resort.	Sha'awa ce ta ƙarshe.
She knows it can be difficult for people.	Ta san yana iya zama da wahala ga mutane.
I know this watch.	Na san wannan kallon.
They never knew any life.	Ba su taɓa sanin wata rayuwa ba.
But it did not stop.	Amma bata daina ba.
It is a pleasure here.	Abin farin ciki ne a nan.
Make me happy.	Ka yi mini farin ciki.
You have something else.	Kuna da wani abu kuma.
But people should eat.	Amma mutane su ci abinci.
It just needs time.	Yana bukatar lokaci kawai.
Something in the discomfort.	Wani abu a cikin rashin jin daɗi.
I still love to play.	Har yanzu ina son yin wasa.
That is a fact.	Hakan ya tabbata.
He felt like me.	Ya ji kamar ni.
Maybe you missed something.	Wataƙila kun rasa wani abu.
Do not use hot water.	Kada a yi amfani da ruwan zafi.
I drank a lot.	Na sha da yawa.
This is her right.	Wannan ita ce dama ta.
They took her.	Suka tafi da ita.
Life is full.	Rayuwa tana da yawa.
But there is nothing they can do about it.	Amma babu abin da za su iya yi game da hakan.
I like to think something good came up with it.	Ina so in yi tunanin wani abu mai kyau ya zo da shi.
I have myself on the floor.	Ina da kaina a kasa.
But in the morning.	Amma da safe.
My head hurts.	Kaina yayi zafi.
Honestly, she understood.	Yayi gaskiya, ta gane.
I'll try it.	Zan gwada shi.
It rained more last night.	An kara samun ruwan sama a daren jiya.
Hopefully nothing will be expected.	Da fatan za a daina tsammanin komai.
You died on me.	Kun mutu a kaina.
They came out slowly, one by one.	Suka fito a hankali, daya bayan daya.
I see no error.	Ban ga kuskure ba.
We don't find any here.	Ba mu sami ko ɗaya a nan.
All the more than you want!	Duk fiye da yadda kuke so!
I can go where you can't.	Zan iya zuwa inda ba za ku iya ba.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
It seems that the second time this happened.	Da alama a karo na biyu abin ya faru.
Long time makes people happy.	Tsawon lokaci yana sa mutane farin ciki.
I don’t know what they’re doing, actually.	Ban san abin da suke yi ba, a gaskiya.
I want to stop there on the entrance.	Ina so in tsaya a can kan hanyar shiga.
She is not afraid of anything.	Bata jin tsoron komai.
It probably won’t happen this year.	Wataƙila ba zai faru a wannan shekara ba.
But they will come.	Amma za su zo.
You do not have to talk about it if you do not want to.	Ba sai ka yi magana a kai ba idan ba ka so.
People just want to talk.	Mutane suna son magana kawai.
And getting bigger.	Kuma samun girma.
I can’t lose my job because you run late.	Ba zan iya rasa aiki ba saboda kuna gudu a makara.
I'm dead	Na mutu
I don’t have much time that day.	Ba ni da lokaci mai yawa a wannan rana.
They will call it quits.	Za su kira shi da hankali.
This is always what is mine.	Wannan shi ne ko da yaushe abin da yake nawa.
He may not have been a police officer.	Watakila bai kasance dan sanda ba.
This is you.	Wannan kai ne.
They are scared.	Suna tsoro.
Not again.	Ba a sake ba.
We are back.	Mun koma.
You have done more for me than anyone else in the world.	Kun yi mini fiye da kowa a duniya.
That is why he loves it.	Shi ya sa yake son sa.
She did well with it.	Ta yi kyau da shi.
It's not, it's just a lie.	Ba haka bane, karya ce kawai.
I think it will not change it.	Ina tsammanin ba zai canza shi ba.
They will all be killed.	Za a kashe su duka.
It didn't help much.	Bai taimaka sosai ba.
And that was too much for me.	Kuma hakan ya yi min yawa.
The train came back to him.	Jirgin ya sake zuwa gare shi.
One is that this is unnecessary.	Na daya shi ne wannan bai zama dole ba.
No one knows the truth.	Babu wanda ya san gaskiya.
Drink if necessary.	Sha idan dole ne.
Of course there are suitors.	Tabbas akwai masu neman aure.
I thought, forgetting it, why remember such things.	Na yi tunani, manta da shi, me yasa tuna irin waɗannan abubuwa.
They looked like some she had seen.	Sun yi kama da wasu da ta gani.
I want to learn how to turn on the equipment.	Ina so in koyi yadda ake kunna kayan aiki.
You just need to know what’s going on.	Kuna buƙatar sanin abin da ke faruwa kawai.
I do not really understand.	Ni ban gane da gaske ba.
What a ?.	Menene a?.
She has no one.	Ba ta da kowa.
But the main task is to finance the fundraiser.	Amma babban aikin shine kudi na kudi na kudi.
So in itself it is great.	Don haka a cikin kansa yana da girma.
Make no mistake about it.	Kar ku yi min kuskure.
This is still difficult for her though.	Wannan har yanzu yana da wuya a gare ta ko da yake.
We are not the only ones to be cut off.	Ba mu kadai ba ne za a yanke.
In fact, we often have to pay a small fee to make them.	A gaskiya ma, sau da yawa za mu biya kuɗi kaɗan don yin su.
I found the library door.	Na sami kofar dakin karatu.
They started knocking on the door.	Suka fara buga kofar gida.
It’s not an easy task, however.	Ba abu mai sauƙi ba ne, duk da haka.
They will get it one way or another.	Za su samu ta wata hanya ko wata.
You have to do what you have to do.	Dole ne ku yi abin da za ku yi.
Now, everything is finished.	A yanzu, an gama komai.
This is sad for me.	Wannan abin bakin ciki ne a gare ni.
The work is not for tomorrow.	Aikin ba na gobe ba ne.
I laughed more.	Da na kara dariya.
At first they had no progress.	Da farko ba su da wani ci gaba.
Let me hear.	Bari in ji.
Maybe you are not interested in this, and that is not good.	Wataƙila ba ku da sha'awar wannan, kuma hakan ba shi da kyau.
You brought it!	Kai ne ka kawo shi!
Maybe he is the person you love.	Wataƙila shi ne mutumin da kuke so.
He may feel that way.	Yana iya jin haka.
It was a kind of wedding night.	Wani irin daren aure ne.
So he did.	Don haka ya yi.
Again, he was right.	Ban da haka, ya yi gaskiya.
He is definitely dead.	Tabbas ya mutu.
But she wondered how she would respond.	Amma ta yi tunanin yadda za ta amsa.
He has no money.	Ba shi da kudi.
They will not be very happy.	Ba za su ji daɗi sosai ba.
I can't tell you what will happen.	Ba zan iya gaya muku abin da zai faru ba.
It didn't hit him.	Bata buga masa ba.
He can't come early.	Ba zai iya zuwa da wuri ba.
He wanted to see the world.	Ya so ya ga duniya.
Now it's too late.	Yanzu ya yi yawa.
Otherwise, it is not.	In ba haka ba, ba haka ba.
No progress.	Babu ci gaba.
You will hear what happens if everything goes right.	Za ku ji abin da zai faru idan komai ya tafi daidai.
You did good to me too.	Kai ma ka yi min kyau.
Great story by the way.	Babban labarin ta hanya.
You do not have to do anything.	Ba lallai ne ku yi komai ba.
She can't do that now.	Ba za ta iya yin hakan ba a yanzu.
So far nothing has been revealed.	Har yanzu babu abin da ya bayyana.
Everything is very nice.	Komai yayi kyau sosai.
It started to look like she was dying wrong.	Ya fara yi kamar ta mutu ba daidai ba.
I said to everyone.	Na ce da kowa.
No one really cared.	Babu wanda ya damu da gaske.
However, nothing is certain in life.	Duk da haka, babu abin da ya tabbata a rayuwa.
Only one of two in the world.	Daya daga cikin biyu kawai a duniya.
And very few people understand that.	Kuma mutane kadan ne suka fahimci hakan.
We have seen something like this before, of course.	Mun taba ganin irin wannan abu a baya, ba shakka.
This however is not so much a problem.	Wannan duk da haka ba shi da matsala sosai.
And more than that, tell him.	Kuma fiye da haka, ka gaya masa.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
I don't give a damn.	Bana masa komai.
All the money was printed.	An buga duk kuɗin.
It will be here.	Zai kasance a nan.
But this is a big case.	Amma wannan babban idan.
The winner was announced yesterday.	Jiya ne aka bayyana wanda ya yi nasara.
Maybe the police are back.	Wataƙila 'yan sanda sun dawo.
No progress has been made.	Babu wani ci gaba da ya zo.
They all did the same.	Duk sun yi daidai.
Let's do the same thing here, he said.	Bari mu yi irin wannan abu a nan, in ji shi.
We have not changed it and we have not made it a failure.	Ba mu canza ta ba kuma ba mu sanya ta kasa ba.
Today, after more than a week, they are fine.	Yau, bayan sama da mako guda, suna da kyau.
What is your favorite food?	Menene abincin da kuka fi so?
It seems necessary.	Da alama ya zama dole.
Now, think of it this way.	Yanzu, yi tunani game da shi ta wannan hanya.
A lot of thoughts are going on in my head.	Tunani da yawa da ke faruwa a cikin kaina.
Surprisingly good.	Mamaki yayi kyau.
They do not make mistakes.	Ba sa yin kuskure.
You have nothing else to do?	Ba ku da sauran abubuwan da za ku yi?
As it is.	Kamar yadda yake.
We have no answer for them.	Ba mu da amsa gare su.
There is nothing interesting here.	Babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa a nan.
I can't wait to see you again.	Ba zan iya jira in sake ganin ku ba.
I did not learn anything new in a month.	Ban koyi wani sabon abu ba a cikin wata guda.
Do not use any of my own.	Kada ku yi amfani da kowane nawa.
I don’t know how this will work.	Ban san yadda wannan zai yi aiki ba.
Look! 	Duba!
But no word came to her.	Amma babu wata magana da ta zo mata.
He would say.	Zai ce.
We are here to help you.	Mun zo nan don taimaka muku.
Good job.	Aiki mai kyau.
We can live with it.	Za mu iya rayuwa da shi.
I want to work with you.	Ina so in yi aiki tare da ku.
Not there.	Ba a can ba.
I don’t feel anyone really does.	Bana jin wani da gaske yake yi.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
No, still	A'a, har yanzu
So that kind of thinking went away.	Don haka irin wannan tunanin ya tafi.
Now it's done.	Yanzu an yi.
They must learn how.	Dole ne su koyi yadda.
They say you will eat everything.	Suka ce za ku ci komai.
The food is good too.	Abincin nan yana da kyau kuma.
Take every opportunity.	Dauki duk damar.
He finished the book on time, he said.	Ya gama littafin a daidai lokacin, ya ce.
Nothing really feels right.	Babu wani abu da yake jin gaske.
Use whatever you enjoy.	Yi amfani da duk abin da kuka ji daɗi da shi.
It takes time and effort to work.	Yana ɗaukar lokaci da ƙoƙari don yin aiki.
No one is going to write that right now.	Babu wanda zai rubuta haka a yanzu.
Married with two children, a good job, a happy life.	Aure tare da yara biyu, kyakkyawan aiki, rayuwa mai dadi.
How old are you? 	Shekaru nawa?
She was surprised.	Ta yi mamaki.
I will save for myself.	Zan ajiye wa kaina.
I hope he says something, like what he knows.	Ina fata ya ce wani abu, kamar abin da ya sani.
I would assume that this is true and not true.	Zan yi tsammanin cewa wannan gaskiya ne kuma ba gaskiya ba ne.
Hope it will rise again.	Fatan zai sake tashi.
God, he was amazing.	Allah, ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
Now you do well.	Yanzu ka yi kyau.
Not many, but few.	Ba yawa ba, amma kaɗan.
Probably so.	Wataƙila hakan ma haka yake.
No one wants anything.	Babu wanda yake son komai.
It can't rain at any time.	Ba zai iya yin ruwan sama a kowane lokaci ba.
It's just too much for him.	Kawai ya yi masa yawa.
I will do that.	Zan yi hakan.
Let me find out though.	Bari in gano wannan ko da yake.
I won't even bring it.	Ba zan ma kawo shi ba.
But it is too hot.	Amma rana ta yi zafi sosai.
He lived a difficult life.	Ya yi rayuwa mai wahala.
Maybe you will be fine.	Wataƙila za ku kasance lafiya.
It is a good effort.	Ƙoƙari ne mai kyau.
Why does one remember this?	Me yasa mutum ya tuna da wannan?
We did not.	Ba mu yi ba.
You have to work and work.	Dole ne ku yi aiki kuma ku yi aiki.
She always enjoyed talking to him.	Kullum tana jin daɗin magana da shi.
After everyone had finished on their own, he moved on to the others.	Bayan kowa ya gama da kansa, sai ya koma ga sauran.
It will come back, of course, but these things take time.	Zai dawo, tabbas, amma waɗannan abubuwan suna ɗaukar lokaci.
Do not be afraid.	Kada ku ji tsoro.
He should not have got it.	Bai kamata ya samu ba.
The rod just ate.	Sanda kawai ta ci.
Look there.	Duba can.
I knew nothing about myself.	Ban san komai game da kaina ba.
Try something completely new.	Gwada wani sabon abu gaba ɗaya.
Children you can sit and live in.	Yara za ku iya zama ku zauna a ciki.
Steel, which gives them.	Karfe, wanda ke ba su.
Eventually they will recognize him.	A ƙarshe za su gane shi.
I could not get her there.	Na kasa kai mata can.
The person involved has nothing to lose.	Mutumin da ke da hannu ba shi da wani abu da zai rasa.
I think there is something.	Ina tsammanin akwai wani abu.
He waited and everyone left.	Ya jira sai kowa ya tafi.
It is a study program.	Shirin karatu ne.
However he said.	Duk da haka ya ce.
But there is still a long way to go.	Amma har yanzu akwai sauran tafiya.
A bus collides with another car killing three people.	Wata motar bas ta yi karo da wata mota inda mutane uku suka mutu.
These are the things that are known.	Waɗannan su ne abubuwan da aka sani.
If so, why not?	Idan wasu, me ya sa ba za su iya ba?
I need to hear what you think.	Ina bukata in ji me kuke tunani.
Go ahead, let's say.	Ci gaba, mu ce.
Run a little.	Gudu kadan.

No one looks like.	Ba wanda yake kama.
He is too.	Shi ma shi ne.
You can not do things like this above.	Ba za ku iya yin abubuwa kamar wannan sama ba.
They could not find a new plane.	Sun kasa samun sabon jirgin sama.

Hopefully, it still works.	Da fatan, har yanzu yana aiki.
Tell us a little about yourself.	Faɗa mana kaɗan game da kanku.
It is unknown who escaped.	Ba a san wanda ya gudu ba.

Be careful not to break anything.	Yi hankali kada ku karya komai.
If I had known you would not have been able to enter.	Da na san ba za ku iya shiga ciki ba.
That's enough.	Ya isa haka.
She begins to cry.	Ta fara kuka.
He was amazed at how well the work was done.	Ya yi mamakin yadda aikin ya yi kyau.
You may like it.	Kuna iya son shi.
More than each other.	Fiye da juna.
You can make a lot of money.	Kuna iya samun kuɗi mai yawa.
Now it just goes out of hand.	Yanzu haka kawai ya fita daga hannu.
He decided to continue eating.	Ya yanke shawarar ci gaba da cin abinci.
It always helps.	Ya taimaka koyaushe.
But it was too cold.	Amma yayi sanyi sosai.
I continued.	Na ci gaba.
Prove the truth about it.	Tabbatar da gaskiya game da shi.
Everyone wants some money!	Kowa yana son wasu kuɗi!
People are tired of me.	Mutane sun gaji da ni.
I'm sorry, this makes you uncomfortable.	Yi hakuri hakan yana ba ku dadi.
Most, however, are fears.	Mafi yawa, duk da haka, tsoro ne.
Not mine, not always.	Ba nawa ba, ba koyaushe ba.
He will never walk, he will never run.	Ba zai taɓa tafiya daidai ba, ba zai taɓa gudu ba.
I like big.	Ina son babban.
It works fine.	Yana aiki daidai.
This is not the time to sit.	Wannan ba lokacin zama ba ne.
Very fast.	Da sauri sosai.
So, let's say this.	Don haka, a ce wannan.
If they had, they would have succeeded.	Da sun samu, da sun yi nasara.
Whatever you want.	Duk abin da kuke so.
Let’s put the first things first.	Mu sanya abubuwa na farko a gaba.
But you still don't want that.	Amma har yanzu ba haka kuke so ba.
We always talk.	Kullum muna magana.
It is not enough.	Bai isa ba.
But no one helped.	Amma babu wanda ya taimaka.
He was about to leave.	Bai kusa fita ba.
We kill them.	Muna kashe su.
Anyone can say that.	Kowa zai iya cewa haka.
I still enjoy doing it.	Har yanzu ina jin daɗin yin shi.
I'm feeling better.	Ina jin dadi.
You see funny today.	Ka ga ban dariya a yau.
It's not right, but it's true.	Ba daidai ba ne, amma gaskiya ce.
No more hearing.	Babu sauran ji.
If it happens, it happens.	Idan ya faru, ya faru.
Happiness.	Farin ciki.
She loves that and everyone.	Tana son hakan da kowa.
I was put in such a position myself.	An sanya ni a cikin irin wannan ni kaina.
Maybe we should give them a chance.	Wataƙila ya kamata mu ba su dama.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
I do not know what the problem is.	Ban san menene matsalar ba.
That's what we signed.	Abin da muka sanya hannu a kansa ke nan.
Look at what happened today.	Kalli abin da ya faru a yau.
I do not know when that time will come.	Ban san lokacin da wannan lokaci zai zo ba.
It's really real.	Yana da gaske sosai.
So just go with what we are going with.	Don haka kawai mu tafi da abin da muke tafiya da shi.
We were able to do a lot of things.	Mun sami damar yin abubuwa da yawa.
It doesn’t fit anything.	Bai dace da wani abu ba.
It was never the right time.	Bai taɓa zama lokacin da ya dace ba.
She got up and was going to leave.	Ta tashi zata tafi.
He immediately went outside.	Nan take ya fita waje.
She wondered how much time was wasted.	Ta yi tunanin nawa ne lokacin bata.
Nothing worked.	Babu wani abu da ya yi aiki.
It was great tonight.	Yayi kyau sosai a daren nan.
He wanted to go out and do things.	Ya so ya fita ya yi abubuwa.
Some did not think she should.	Wasu ba su yi tunanin ya kamata ta yi ba.
Then two nights.	Sai dare biyu.
Now kids, we have to talk about what you saw.	Yanzu yara, dole ne mu yi magana game da abin da kuka gani.
If anyone hears something she did.	Idan wani ya ji wani abu da ta yi.
Since then I have been taking care of myself.	Tun daga nan nake kula da kaina.
He said.	Yace.
Unlike her.	Ba kamar ta ba.
It may even be good.	Yana iya ma yana da kyau.
This is a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne.
We ate.	Mun ci abinci.
No thought touched her.	Babu wani tunani da ya taba ta.
So, it is not difficult at all.	Don haka, ba shi da wahala ko kaɗan.
Just to name a few.	Kawai don suna wasu.
The police would not want that.	'Yan sanda ba za su so haka ba.
We were about.	Mun kasance game.
Any kind of work can be.	Ko wane irin aiki zai iya zama.
Of course.	Ya tabbata.
The meeting will definitely be full of them.	Ba shakka taron zai cika da su.
Use any such time.	Yi amfani da kowane irin wannan lokacin.
You must do this.	Dole ne ku yi wannan.
I can't go there now.	Ba zan iya zuwa can yanzu ba.
She also needs a home.	Ita ma tana bukatar gida.
They have not yet been identified.	Har yanzu ba a gano su ba.
He gets tired when he is late.	Ya kan gaji idan ya makara.
I want to talk to you.	Ina so in yi magana da ku.
It should be understood it may not be so easy.	Ya kamata a gane ba zai iya zama da sauƙi haka ba.
Which, in a way, is.	Wanda, a wata hanya, yana da.
I hope you will call me.	Ina fatan za ku kira ni.
He left in the morning.	Ya tafi tun safe.
I love her.	Ina son ta.
Is that so for you?	Haka ya kasance gare ku?
I can't remember exactly what it was called.	Ba zan iya tuna ainihin abin da ake kira shi ba.
I have never done such a thing.	Ban taba yin irin wannan abu ba.
For a moment.	Na wani lokaci.
She will not give up.	Ba za ta bari ba.
I went back to the car.	Na koma mota.
Not much, but he still took his life.	Ba da yawa ba, amma har yanzu kuma sai ya ɗauki rai.
I was so completely.	Na kasance haka gaba daya.
The ultimate goal is life as a whole.	Babban abin ƙarshe shine rayuwa gaba ɗaya.
I feel for you.	Ina ji da ku.
I am reading this book.	Ina karanta wannan littafin.
I will go home.	Zan tafi gida.
Check to see how it feels.	Duba don ganin yadda yake ji.
Let's talk about this.	Bari mu yi magana game da wannan.
In a year or two, we will be fine.	A cikin shekara guda ko biyu, za mu kasance lafiya.
The film is well documented.	An yi fim sosai.
I just ran	Na gudu kawai
He says he doesn't, but he does.	Ya ce ba ya yi, amma yana yi.
Don't worry.	Kar ku damu.
But sometimes things get easier.	Amma wani lokacin abubuwa suna da sauƙi.
We called the police to arrest him.	Sai da muka kira ‘yan sanda su kama shi.
I let him stay with me for a while.	Na bar shi ya zauna tare da ni na ɗan lokaci.
I want to see if she is sick.	Ina so in ga cewa ba ta da lafiya.
They will not come to the festival!	Ba za su zo bikin ba!
And this is where we made the mistake.	Kuma a nan ne muka yi kuskure.
I wrote about this.	Na rubuta game da wannan.
They can't see.	Ba su iya gani.
He is still waiting for her to speak.	Har yanzu yana jiran ta yi magana.
I never had coffee.	Ban taba ba ni kofi ba.
You always express how other people feel.	Kullum kuna bayyana yadda sauran mutane suke ji.
You can pay for it.	Kuna iya biya shi.
We thought we would never find a home when we returned.	Mun yi tsammanin ba za mu sami gida ba lokacin da muka dawo.
He is saying something.	Yana cewa wani abu.
I used that.	Na yi amfani da hakan.
Of course, that did not happen.	Tabbas hakan bai faru ba.
Maybe you will enjoy it.	Wataƙila za ku ji daɗi.
I wonder where she went.	Ina mamakin inda ta tafi.
This is more functional.	Wannan ya fi aiki.
This worked a little, but it didn't work anymore.	Wannan ya ɗan yi aiki, amma ba ya ƙara yin aiki.
This is not due to lack of interest.	Wannan ba saboda rashin sha'awa ba ne.
Make it right.	Yi dama.
It always amazes me how life is not right.	Kullum yana bani mamaki yadda rayuwa ba ta zama daidai ba.
She said it must be true.	Ta ce tabbas yana da gaskiya.
And athletes are not used to it.	Kuma 'yan wasa ba su saba yi ba.
That is what they are telling us now.	Abin da suke gaya mana ke nan yanzu.
No, she did not know where he would be going.	A'a, ba ta san inda zai kasance ba.
Something like.	Wani abu kamar.
He stood where he was.	Ya tsaya a inda yake.
Think only of passion.	Yi tunani game da sha'awa kadai.
It's coming.	Yana zuwa.
He did not rise.	Bai tashi ba.
You know they are.	Kun san sun kasance.
Sad to say.	Bakin ciki in ce.
And it can't happen.	Kuma ba zai iya faruwa ba.
Despite some grief she was released.	Duk da wasu bak'in ciki suka sake ta.
We actually got into this at the same time.	Ainihin mun shiga cikin wannan a lokaci guda.
It's right there.	Yana nan daidai.
How can life go on like this!	Ta yaya rayuwa za ta ci gaba da tafiya a haka!
So take your time.	Don haka dauki lokacin ku.
We still hope.	Har yanzu muna fata.
No one knows exactly what to do.	Babu wanda ya san ainihin abin da zai yi.
Everything is explained.	An bayyana komai.
At first she liked him, but then she hated him.	Da farko ta so shi, amma sai ta ƙi shi.
They can't be real.	Ba za su iya zama da gaske ba.
I understand this.	Na fahimci wannan.
I am married.	Na yi aure.
And now they will not be.	Kuma yanzu ba za su kasance ba.
If not, you will only get one.	Idan ba haka ba, za ku sami ɗaya kawai.
It has always been good for me.	Ya kasance mai kyau a gare ni koyaushe.
She was ready for the night to end.	Ta shirya don dare ya kare.
It takes attention.	Yana ɗaukar hankali.
We proved it.	Mun tabbatar da hakan.
But it really is.	Amma da gaske ne.
This is the second mistake.	Kuskure na biyu kenan.
If corrected later.	Idan aka gyara daga baya.
Such a decision should not be made immediately.	Bai kamata a yanke irin wannan shawarar nan da nan ba.
But one.	Amma daya.
I should not go there.	Bai kamata in tafi wurin ba.
I want them to be cold.	Ina so su yi sanyi.
You have a good reputation.	Kuna da suna mai kyau.
I did not grow up that way.	Ni ban girma haka ba.
I can't do it right now.	Ba zan iya yin shi a yanzu ba.
I heard it.	Na ji shi.
No, he didn't care.	A'a, bai damu ba.
She can sing.	Ta iya waƙa.
Right it is amazing.	Dama yana da ban mamaki.
Many died.	Mutane da yawa sun mutu.
Honestly I don't care anymore.	Gaskiya ban damu ba kuma.
He died two days later.	Ya mutu kwana biyu.
This is your home.	Wannan shine gidan ku.
She told me that in the past.	Ta gaya min cewa a baya.
He is not dead '.	Bai mutu ba'.
But, perhaps, not for you.	Amma, watakila, ba don ku ba.
So we just know.	Don haka mun sani kawai.
Today will be difficult though.	Yau zai yi wuya ko da yake.
I always do that.	Kullum ina yin hakan.
We entered the room together.	Muka shiga dakin tare.
Or he made time.	Ko kuma ya sanya lokaci.
He was given water and some food.	Aka ba shi ruwa da abinci kadan.
The food is hot.	Abincin yayi zafi.
You have to do it for us often.	Dole ne ku yi mana sau da yawa.
There has never been a better time in life.	Ba a taɓa samun mafi kyawun lokacin rayuwa ba.
It is not what she does to her.	Ba abin da take yi mata ba ne.
You missed this or you missed that.	Kun rasa wannan ko kuma kun rasa wannan.
I'll go out again.	Zan kara fita.
It makes him go faster.	Yana sa ya tafi da sauri.
In fact, kill them somehow.	A gaskiya, ku kashe su ko ta yaya.
It's my game.	Yana da wasa na.
He was above such people.	Ya kasance sama da mutane irin wannan.
It's good too.	Yana da kyau kuma.
These are honest people.	Waɗannan mutane ne masu gaskiya.
Things are not going well.	Abubuwan ba su da kyau.
When this session took place.	Lokacin da wannan zama ya faru.
I doubt, if they have any interest, that it will work.	Ina shakka, idan suna da wani sha'awa, cewa zai yi aiki.
He should be in school.	Ya kamata ya kasance a makaranta.
Explain how they work.	Bayyana yadda suke aiki.
I'm just trying to be successful.	Ina ƙoƙarin yin nasara ne kawai.
We can't afford that.	Ba ma iya samun wannan dama.
I was very happy with it.	Na yi matukar farin ciki da shi.
I do not want to get anything done.	Ba na son samun abin yi.
He was always a good kid.	Ya kasance yaro mai kyau koyaushe.
He hopes	Ya yi fatan
I had to prepare to travel at the same time.	Dole ne in shirya don tafiya lokaci guda.
The police will not work	'Yan sanda ba za su yi aiki ba
She fell into them.	Ta fad'a cikin su.
It took a while.	Ya ɗauki ɗan lokaci.
It is what you want to do.	Shi ne abin da kuke so ku yi.
He was surprised by the story.	Ya yi mamakin labarin.
This woman is accustomed to a strange.	Wannan mata ta saba da ban mamaki.
Either way, it 's good to see you again.	Ko ta yaya, yana da kyau in sake ganin ku.
Then he turned to me.	Sai ya koma gare ni.
I'll show you how.	Zan nuna maka yadda aka yi.
It's late.	Lokaci ya wuce.
So we are together.	Don haka muna tare.
At least we are not home.	Ko kadan ba mu gida.
He was smart, he was a little focused.	Ya kasance mai hankali, ya mai da hankali kadan.
However, the program does not work.	Duk da haka, shirin baya aiki.
He did not want anyone.	Bai so kowa ba.
The best way.	Hanya mafi kyau.
They just sit.	Zaune suke kawai.
Hopefully it will be bigger and better.	Da fatan zai kasance mafi girma kuma mafi kyau.
This is not going to be a joke.	Wannan ba zai zama wasa ba.
It can't be done tonight.	Ba za a iya yi a daren yau ba.
It is uncertain.	Ba shi da tabbas.
What in the world.	Me a duniya.
I tried to think back.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin tunani baya.
They are made.	An yi su.
He went back.      	Ya koma baya.      
But you know this.	Amma ku san wannan.
Something big is happening.	Babban abu yana faruwa.
It is very good to know him well.	Yana da kyau sosai don sanin shi da kyau.
Now it is mine.	Yanzu ya zama nawa.
I do not know this.	Ban san wannan ba.
You have access to them.	Kuna da damar samun su.
You know how to feel when you are scared or excited.	Kuna san ji lokacin da kuke jin tsoro ko jin daɗi.
I wish this was not real.	Ina son wannan bai zama na gaske ba.
If you accept this, you will succeed.	Idan kun yarda da wannan, za ku yi nasara.
It will make everything easier.	Zai sa komai ya fi sauƙi.
Still, there is a problem.	Har yanzu, akwai matsala.
The world is not there.	Duniya kasa can.
I can't wait to hear how it went.	Ba zan iya jira don jin yadda abin ya kasance ba.
We must think ahead.	Dole ne mu yi tunani gaba.
Just log in.	Ana shiga kawai.
You will not do it.	Ba za ku yi ba.
Go where you want.	Ku tafi inda kuke so.
First you will.	Da farko za ku.
Everyone is looking down.	Kowa yana kallon kasa.
I'm not sure they've ever been there.	Ban tabbata sun taba can ba.
You can, you know.	Kuna iya, kun sani.
You want to stay home.	Kuna so ku zauna dan gidan.
No work, no food.	Babu aiki, babu abinci.
They sit and wait.	Suka zauna suna jira.
This is why.	Wannan shi ne dalilin da ya sa.
That's what everyone is talking about.	Abin da kowa ke magana ke nan.
It must be raining.	Dole ne ya zama ruwan sama.
She loves how it makes her feel.	Ta na son yadda ya sa ta ji.
And so you are.	Kuma haka ku ke.
I have never had a child.	Ban taba yaro ba.
She should not do that either.	Ita ma bai kamata ta yi hakan ba.
I just like these.	Ina son waɗannan kawai.
I wonder how they do it.	Ina mamakin yadda suke yin hakan.
Nothing easy.	Babu wani abu mai sauƙi.
The room will not work with more than one person in it.	Dakin ba zai yi aiki da fiye da mutum ɗaya a ciki ba.
Is that all?	Shin duka kenan?
It didn't seem to work.	Ba kamar ya yi aiki ba.
The big event, we are told, is coming.	Babban taron, an gaya mana, yana nan zuwa.
No one heard anything.	Ba wanda ya ji wani abu.
Who knows, it might work.	Wanene ya sani, yana iya aiki.
I do not want to talk about it.	Ba na son yin magana game da shi.
After this opportunity.	Bayan wannan dama.
But that did not happen.	Amma ba haka ya faru ba.
Please if you can help me with this.	Don Allah idan za ku iya taimaka mini da wannan.
She quickly ate.	Da sauri ta ci abinci.
People will spend less money.	Mutane za su kashe kuɗi kaɗan.
Everything must stop.	Dole ne komai ya tsaya.
I realized he was on his way.	Na fahimci yana kan hanya.
You are here, you can use yourself.	Kuna nan, kuna iya yin amfani da kanku.
That's a lot of money.	Wannan kudi ne mai yawa.
Make no mistake.	Kada ku yi kuskure.
It's a big job.	Babban aiki ne.
This seems strange to me.	Wannan ga alama ya saba mani.
They decided it would be best to go to the police.	Sun yanke shawarar cewa zai fi kyau a je wurin 'yan sanda.
I will put it forward with you.	Zan sa shi a gaba tare da ku.
About two things.	Game da abubuwa biyu.
We have it.	Muna da shi.
But of course, there is much more to it.	Amma ba shakka, akwai da yawa fiye da shi.
No one came out.	Ba wanda ya fito.
Or it could be.	Ko kuma yana iya zama.
You do not like that.	Ba ku son hakan.
Required	Da ake bukata
I have to save it tomorrow.	Dole ne in ajiye shi gobe.
Understand the reason.	Gane dalilin .

Remove the water.	Cire ruwan.
They were real.	Sun kasance na gaske.
Don't buy too much.	Kada ku saya da yawa.
But do not expect too much.	Amma kar ka yi fata da yawa.
Maybe the speaker is trying to help.	Wataƙila mai magana yana ƙoƙari ya taimaka.

Amazing year.	Shekara mai ban mamaki.
Now you can do whatever you want.	Yanzu za ku iya yin duk abin da kuke so.
It does not seem to be true, it does not matter.	Ga alama ba gaskiya ba ne, babu wani abu da yake yi.
It seems that there must be a problem.	Da alama cewa dole ne matsalar.
He could not cry.	Ya kasa kuka.
It's time to fix it.	Lokacin gyara ya yi.
You have never heard of it.	Ba ka taba jin shi ba.
I do not need anything.	Bana bukatar komai.
However, this conclusion is not necessary.	Duk da haka, wannan ƙarshe bai zama dole ba.
She was working from morning till night.	Ta kasance tana aiki tun safe har dare.
You do not have time to run.	Bata da lokacin gudu.
Did that happen.	Shin abin ya faru.
You do not know if you want to laugh or cry.	Ba ku sani ba ko kuna son yin dariya ko kuka.
It is like a journey by water.	Kamar tafiya ta ruwa ne.
She wondered if she should get married or not.	Ta yi tunanin haka ya kamata a yi aure ko a'a.
No, really scary.	A'a, da gaske tsoro.
I asked her once so she could tell me more.	Na tambaye ta sau ɗaya don ta ƙara ba ni labarin.
At first, many did.	Da farko, da yawa sun yi haka.
We will leave together and walk to your house.	Za mu tashi tare mu yi tafiya zuwa gidan ku.
He told them our story.	Shi ne ya ba su labarin mu.
You have to put it into play.	Dole ne ku sanya shi cikin wasa.
Tonight after they return home it would be better.	Daren yau bayan sun koma gida zai fi kyau.
We will use them again.	Za mu sake amfani da su.
No one knows about the man.	Babu wanda ya san game da mutumin.
It's scary.	Abin ban tsoro ne.
You will be amazed at how much this works.	Za ku yi mamakin nawa wannan ke aiki.
Never do that.	Kada ku taɓa yin haka.
Your job is.	Aikin ku shine.
How can they go.	Ta yaya za su iya tafiya.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
As before,	Kamar yadda ya gabata,

Kids seem to like it.	Yara kamar suna son shi.
You marked me.	Kun yi min alama.
It feels so good for the cold.	Ya ji daɗi sosai don sanyi.
You can’t just sit and expect it to happen.	Ba za ku iya zama kawai ku yi tsammanin za ku faru ba.
It's better there.	Ya fi kyau a can.
He had a toilet.	Da yana da bayan gida.
Time is running out.	Lokaci ya yi kuskure.
He can go to the police.	Zai iya zuwa wurin 'yan sanda.
I honestly don't care.	Ni gaskiya ban damu ba.
But I can say that.	Amma zan iya cewa wannan.
Come and start walking with us.	Ku zo ku fara tafiya tare da mu.
Not everyone goes that route, however.	Ba kowa ke tafiya wannan hanyar ba, duk da haka.
They are citizens here.	Su 'yan kasa ne a nan.
You may enjoy this book.	Kuna iya jin daɗin wannan littafin.
And you will cover your mouth.	Kuma za ku rufe bakin ku.
I can't let that happen.	Ba zan iya barin hakan ta faru ba.
Check it out by the way.	Duba shi ta hanya.
Maybe they were made like them.	Wataƙila an yi su kamar su.
I think it should be something like that.	Ina tsammanin yakamata ya zama wani abu kamar haka.
We get that a lot.	Muna samun hakan da yawa.
Are you sure we are allowed to do this?	Shin kun tabbata an ba mu damar yin wannan?
I must go.	Ina so in tafi.
But we didn't care.	Amma ba mu damu ba.
That was the last two years we talked.	Shekaru biyu kenan da muka yi magana ta ƙarshe.
But some are not healthy and have even started.	Amma wasu ba su da lafiya har ma sun fara.
Not a good place.	Ba wuri mai kyau ba.
And no one asked him.	Kuma babu wanda ya tambaye shi.
We know it will not be found.	Mun san ba za a samu ba.
She is sure.	Ita ma ta tabbata.
It would be good for everyone but me.	Zai yi kyau ga kowa sai ni.
He doesn't want anything to do with her.	Ba ya son komai da ita.
Maybe he thought she would do it.	Watakila ya yi tsammanin za ta yi hakan.
But that can work, too.	Amma wannan zai iya aiki, kuma.
Now the time has come.	Yanzu lokaci ya zo.
They bring you a drink later for enjoyment.	Suna kawo muku abin sha daga baya don jin daɗi.
Immediately he came back lying.	Nan take ya dawo karya.
Sing to him gently.	Ku yi masa waƙa a hankali.
It is difficult to believe that something could go wrong at this point.	Yana da wuya a yarda wani abu zai iya yin kuskure a wannan wurin.
It is coffee in the morning.	Kofi ne da safe.
This is also wrong.	Wannan kuma ba daidai ba ne.
Who knows where.	Wa ya san inda.
He just made a mistake.	Kawai yayi kuskure.
This thing works really well.	Wannan abu yana aiki da gaske.
I wish.	Da na so.
He did nothing more.	Bai kara yin komai ba.
A smart boy.	Yaro mai hankali.
Sleep will be up.	Barci zai zama sama.
One should get used to it.	Ya kamata mutum ya saba.
It seems it has not been done.	Da alama ba a yi ba.
Keep doing this.	Ci gaba da yin wannan.
Best wait.	Mafi kyawun jira.
I'm fine with that.	Ina lafiya da wannan.
It took a little effort, but in the end it worked.	Ya ɗauki ɗan ƙoƙari, amma a ƙarshe ya yi nasara.
In the second thought, she decided not to go.	A tunani na biyu, ta yanke shawarar ba za ta tafi ba.
We will not say more about that.	Ba za mu ƙara cewa game da hakan ba.
I have to leave early today.	Dole na tafi da wuri yau.
They seem to be just that.	Da alama suna nan kawai.
I finished.	Na gama.
That's it.	Wannan ya yi.
Pretty kid, though.	Kyakkyawan yaro, ko da yake.
I do not think that is true.	Bana jin hakan gaskiya ne.
You will love it when you use it.	Za ku so shi lokacin da kuke amfani da shi.
I want to talk to you.	Ina so in yi magana da ku.
I do not think twice.	Ba na tunanin sau biyu.
We used to disagree.	Mun kasance ba mu yarda ba.
Suddenly she felt like a winner.	Nan take ta ji kamar mai nasara.
You are not intelligent.	Ba ku da hankali.
And she was sure she would never hear anything again.	Kuma ta tabbata ba za ta sake jin komai ba.
Everything is saved.	An ajiye komai.
It is better to accept it.	Gara yarda da shi.
Hope you too.	Da fatan kai ma.
You do not even know.	Ba ku ma sani ba.
She drank coffee.	Ta sha kofi.
They protect us from other people.	Suna kare mu daga sauran mutane.
He is indeed the best of men.	Lallai shi ne mafi kyawun mutum.
He does not want to accept that.	Baya son yarda da hakan.
You think about it.	Kuna tunani a kai.
This is the best opportunity to do so.	Wannan ita ce mafi kyawun damar yin hakan.
And that is hard to hear.	Kuma hakan yana da wuya a ji.
We have no home, no place.	Ba mu da gida, babu wurin.
It showed outside, as she did.	Ya nuna waje, kamar yadda ta yi.
But this is a mistake.	Amma wannan kuskure ne.
I told him you were amazing in every way.	Na ce masa kana da ban mamaki ta kowace hanya.
Or maybe repeat another inactivity.	Ko watakila sake sake wani rashin aiki.
No one will help you.	Babu wanda zai taimake ku.
Yet he did not do what came his way.	Amma duk da haka bai yi abin da ya zo masa ba.
He lives in fear.	Yana zaune cikin tsoro.
Life is no better.	Rayuwa ba ta fi wannan ba.
Think about it a lot.	Yi tunani game da shi da yawa.
And that's just the beginning.	Kuma wannan ya fara ne.
And they will never find us.	Kuma ba za su taba samun mu ba.
They were great.	Sun kasance masu girma.
I love them too, passionately.	Ina son su kuma, cikin sha'awa.
There is also no one.	Haka kuma babu kowa.
Man, this is amazing.	Mutum, wannan yana da ban mamaki.
I know very little.	Na sani kadan.
I would not say it makes the user a god.	Ba zan ce yana sa mai amfani da shi ya zama allah ba.
Please read this book.	Da fatan za a karanta wannan littafin.
Call me if you know more.	Kira ni idan kun san ƙarin.
She is afraid of this dog.	Ta ji tsoron wannan kare.
Someone suggested we go early.	Wani ya ba mu shawarar mu tafi da wuri.
We should call the police.	Ya kamata mu kira 'yan sanda.
The others did the same.	Haka sauran suka yi.
It requires more effort, but it makes things easier.	Yana buƙatar ƙarin ƙoƙari, amma yana ba da sauƙi ga abubuwa.
I remember the wound on the wound.	Na tuna rauni akan rauni.
We should write all this.	Yakamata mu rubuta duk wannan.
This is not what we need.	Wannan ba shine abin da muke bukata ba.
No one even knew that such things could be found.	Ba wanda ma ya san za a iya samun irin waɗannan abubuwa.
To me it was amazing.	A gare ni abin ban mamaki ne.
I don't show it.	Ba na nuna shi.
People filled the train station.	Mutane sun cika tashar jirgin kasa.
They are enough.	Sun isa sosai.
There is so much we miss.	Akwai da yawa da muka rasa.
Remember these things.	Ka tuna waɗannan abubuwan.
You don’t need it and it doesn’t suit you.	Ba ku buƙatar shi kuma bai dace da ku ba.
He would have killed many people.	Da ya kashe mutane da yawa.
Not sure what.	Ban tabbata ko menene ba.
The meeting was great.	Babban taron yayi kyau.
I think maybe we should lie.	Ina tunanin watakila ya kamata mu yi karya.
After many years, they finally met.	Bayan shekaru da yawa, a ƙarshe sun hadu.
And that's right.	Kuma hakan yayi daidai.
I have to call it quits.	Dole ne in kira shi in kira shi.
It has been largely forgotten.	An manta sosai.
After a while, he was arrested.	Bayan wani lokaci, ya kama shi.
It's our time.	Sai lokacin mu.
I do not want to get involved.	Bana son shiga ciki.
I finished.	Na gama.
I am single.	Ban yi aure ba.
We have to do something, she said.	Dole ne mu yi wani abu, in ji ta.
Maybe he felt that way.	Wataƙila ya ji haka.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
It is unknown how he died.	Ba a san yadda ya mutu ba.
Then show me.	Sai ka nuna min.
And we must let everything go now.	Kuma dole ne mu bar duk abin ya tafi yanzu.
You know they are inside for money.	Kun san suna ciki ne don kuɗi.
She is as good to me as anyone.	Tana da kyau a gare ni, kamar yadda kowa yake.
At what time.	A wani lokaci.
The workbook will be used for homework.	Za a yi amfani da littafin aikin don aikin gida.
I could never really do such a thing, of course.	Ba zan iya taɓa yin irin wannan abu da gaske ba, ba shakka.
Not after the truth.	Ba bayan gaskiya ba.
I think it will be very difficult.	Ina tsammanin zai yi wahala sosai.
It’s exciting and scary at the same time.	Yana da ban sha'awa da ban tsoro a lokaci guda.
Look, that's how it is done!	Duba, haka ake yi!
I'm trying to feel right.	Ina ƙoƙari na ji daidai.
This person will not protect anyone but himself.	Wannan mutumin ba zai kare kowa ba sai kansa.
They are working on it now.	Suna aiki a kai yanzu.
Because of the rain.	Saboda ruwan sama.
And now here she is.	Yanzu kuma ga ita.
You should take advantage of the opportunity.	Ya kamata ku yi amfani da dama.
We have been waiting a long time.	Mu ne muka dade muna jira.
I've been here ever since.	Tun lokacin nake nan.
Just lost.	Kamar bata.
Don't talk to me about it!	Kar ku yi min magana game da shi!
Then sell.	Sai ka sayar.
Anything can happen at the time.	Duk abubuwa na iya faruwa a lokacin.
Only one person died.	Mutum daya ne ya mutu.
I hope you found something useful here.	Ina fatan kun sami wani abu mai amfani a nan.
I learned that.	Na koyi hakan.
They make us more focused and focused.	Suna kara mana hankali da mai da hankali.
Everyone must think positively.	Dole ne kowa ya yi tunani mai kyau.
That would be the best, after all.	Wannan zai zama mafi kyau, bayan duk.
I can't see either.	Ni ma ban iya gani ba.
And also fear that everything.	Kuma ma tsoron cewa komai.
This is not for us.	Wannan ba mu bane.
But then she stopped.	Amma sai ta tsaya.
I want you to be with me.	Ina so ku kasance tare da ni.
Yet he was probably right.	Amma duk da haka watakila ya yi gaskiya.
She left the door open.	Ta bar kofar a bude.
I do not see it.	Ban ga haka ba.
I know they are there.	Na san suna can.
But it certainly sounds good.	Amma tabbas yana da kyau a ji.
Let the fear begin.	Bari tsoro ya fara.
They do not drive there.	Ba sa tuƙi a can.
Feeling good, people are taking care of me.	Jin dadi, mutane suna kula da ni.
They think you will do, well, exactly what you did.	Suna tsammanin za ku yi, da kyau, daidai abin da kuka yi.
I don’t know why it would work but not a little.	Ban san dalilin da yasa zai yi aiki ba amma ba kadan ba.
I will return	zan koma
I sat and did nothing.	Na zauna ban yi komai ba.
It does not surprise me at all.	Ba ya bani mamaki ko kadan.
They met for lunch.	Sun hadu da abincin rana.
Terrible words, he thought.	Magana mai ban tsoro, ya yi tunani.
What kind of dog is this?	Wane irin kare ne wannan?
Just stop later.	Kawai tsaya daga baya.
I went to another country on my own.	Na tafi da wani kasa da kaina.
It's just everything.	Komai ne kawai.
I can’t change it or how it feels.	Ba zan iya canza shi ko yadda yake ji ba.
We had to run to catch the bus.	Sai da muka gudu don mu kama bas.
And I really want to have one.	Kuma ina matukar son samun daya.
I am not in this for money.	Ba na cikin wannan don kuɗi.
They have been tested.	An gwada su.
I'll tell you when.	Zan gaya muku yaushe.
It didn’t make him work.	Bai sanya shi aiki ba.
This is what you should do.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya kamata ku yi.
You must have made me leave.	Lallai kun sa na tafi.
The last one did.	Na karshen ya yi.
You are right.	Kuna yi daidai.
So just get used to it.	Don haka sai kawai ka saba da shi.
This room is amazing.	Wannan dakin ban mamaki.
Money.	Kudi.
The fight is over before everyone knows it started.	An gama fada kafin kowa ya san an fara.
She used a false name.	Ta yi amfani da sunan karya.
In fact, we hate it more than we want to enjoy it.	A gaskiya ma, mun ƙi shi fiye da yadda muke son jin daɗi.
So of course, he has to do it.	Don haka ba shakka, dole ne ya yi.
This is true, it always happens.	Wannan gaskiya ne, yana faruwa koyaushe.
There are still two more.	Har yanzu akwai sauran guda biyu.
After that they were taken away.	Bayan haka aka tafi da su.
But boy, he made you.	Amma yaro, ya sanya ka.
Of course we are worried.	Tabbas mun damu.
I worked with this.	Na yi aiki da wannan.
I would have known better.	Da na fi sanin gudu.
I need it.	Ina bukata.
Someone else will answer.	Wani kuma zai amsa masa.
I want the pain to go away.	Ina son wahala ta tafi.
They can't wait to go.	Ba za su iya jira su tafi ba.
The story is told in a simple way.	An ba da labarin a baya mai sauƙi.
He was almost right.	Ya kusan yi gaskiya.
A good tool maybe.	Kyakkyawan kayan aiki watakila.
I am happy about that.	Na yi farin ciki da hakan.
But this is wrong.	Amma wannan ba daidai ba ne.
We have already cut off your heads.	Mun riga mun yanke kan ku.
The meeting should not have taken place.	Bai kamata a yi taron ba.
You told me.	Kun gaya mani.
They worked together.	Sun yi aiki tare.
She knows what it is now.	Ta san abin da yake yanzu.
It's very out.	Yana da fita sosai.
They are relatively healthy and comfortable.	Suna da in mun gwada da lafiya da daɗi.
Then there is the problem of children.	Sai kuma matsalar yara.
Think about what happened.	Ka yi tunanin abin da ya faru.
I'm sure it will eventually happen.	Na tabbata, a ƙarshe zai faru.
You know, you really are.	Ka sani, da gaske kana da kyau.
That's enough.	Kun isa haka.
But for a while.	Amma na ɗan lokaci ne.
One year passed.	Wata shekara ta wuce.
Two people came to help.	Mutane biyu ne suka zo don su taimaka.
Do not say anything.	Kar a ce komai.
And it's really good.	Kuma yana da kyau sosai.
Today seems to be the right time for him.	Yau da alama lokacin da ya dace da shi.
Maybe he met someone.	Watakila ya hadu da wani.
He did not stop right.	Bai tsaya dama ba.
Another thing is love.	Wani abu kuma so ne.
She doesn't like us.	Ba ta son mu.
The game to keep growing.	Wasan don ci gaba da girma.
I think they came later, though.	Ina tsammanin sun zo daga baya, ko da yake.
We should get more than that.	Ya kamata mu samu fiye da haka.
I can no longer take it.	Ba zan iya ƙara ɗauka ba.
You enjoyed your stay.	Kun ji daɗin jin daɗin ku.
I let the fear go.	Na bar tsoro ya tafi.
He wanted to kill him.	Da ya so ya kashe shi.
I will accept that.	Zan yarda da hakan.
He told himself that this was his job.	Ya gaya wa kansa cewa wannan aikin shi ne.
Only there.	A can ne kawai.
But they probably did not.	Amma watakila ba su yi ba.
He did not answer me.	Bai amsa min ba.
I want a new feeling	Ina son sabon ji
Now go.	Yanzu tafi.
It is very cold outside.	Yayi sanyi sosai a waje.
But how do they do it?	Amma ta yaya suke yin hakan.
You do not have what it takes to continue.	Ba ku sami abin da ake ɗauka don ci gaba ba.
If this continues and I think it will.	Idan wannan ya ci gaba kuma ina tsammanin zai yi.
Girls love me.	'Yan mata suna son ni.
Keep this in mind when you next drink.	Ka tuna da wannan a lokacin da za ka sha na gaba.
You are very busy.	Kun kasance cikin aiki sosai.
I will pay more attention in the future.	Zan kara kula a nan gaba.
It can develop over a lifetime.	Yana iya ci gaba a tsawon rayuwa.
You may not realize it, but you do.	Wataƙila ba za ku gane hakan ba, amma kuna yi.
I know how much he loves you.	Na san yadda yake son ku.
Not the third.	Ba na uku ba.
Slowly, slowly.	A hankali, a hankali.
Please can you help me with that.	Don Allah za ku iya taimaka mini da hakan.
Increased volume.	An ƙara ƙara.
This can be seen in the following.	Ana iya ganin wannan a cikin masu zuwa.
Still, it looks happy.	Duk da haka, ya yi kama da farin ciki.
Make this a wonderful day as much as you can.	Ka sanya wannan rana mai ban mamaki kamar yadda za ku iya.
I need to sleep.	Ina bukata in yi barci.
Every day brings unexpected things.	Kowace rana tana kawo abubuwan da ba a zata ba.
Hopefully, maybe.	Fatan kadan, watakila.
That's what he wants.	Abin da yake so ne.
I found time for them once.	Na sami lokaci a gare su sau ɗaya.
Proved here.	Ya tabbatar a nan.
Somehow I can work.	Ko ta yaya na iya aiki.
And hurry about it.	Kuma ku yi sauri game da shi.
But they still haven’t got it.	Amma har yanzu ba su samu ba.
There is plenty of water here!	Ruwa yana da yawa a nan!
It's a lie.	Karya ce.
You may have been married for many years.	Wataƙila kun yi aure shekaru da yawa.
It plays like that.	Yana wasa haka.
Whatever happened, everyone knew about it.	Duk abin da ya faru, kowa ya san game da shi.
I love that about you.	Ina son hakan game da ku.
Enjoy yourself.	Yi wa kanku dadi.
I want others to hear that.	Ina son wasu su ji haka.
Or they will be cold.	Ko kuma za su yi sanyi.
It was some years ago.	Ya kasance wasu shekaru da suka wuce.
The story is not good.	Labarin bai yi kyau ba.
And it is true.	Kuma gaskiya ne.
Extraordinary cold.	Sanyi da bai saba ba.
A big.	A babban.
I do not understand this.	Ban gane wannan ba.
However, it may be.	Duk da haka, yana iya zama.
I don't know if that tells us anything.	Ban sani ba ko hakan ya gaya mana wani abu.
I wouldn’t even try to play this game with her.	Ba zan ma yi ƙoƙarin yin wannan wasan da ita ba.
And you know me.	Kuma kun san ni.
We really like this guy.	Muna son mutumin nan sosai.
It has not been reused.	Ba a sake amfani da shi ba.
Two others are sitting.	Wasu biyu suna zaune.
But they did not help.	Amma ba su taimaka ba.
It's a big car.	Yana da babban mota.
In every job.	A cikin kowane aiki.
He could not take it, seriously.	Ya kasa ɗauka, da gaske.
Time passed, it was closed.	Lokaci ya wuce, an rufe.
Not us or them.	Ba mu ko su ba.
Duration.	Tsawon lokaci.
He felt uncomfortable.	Ya ji babu dadi.
He gave everything.	Ya ba da komai.
Nothing now.	Ba komai yanzu.
Whatever it was.	Duk abin da ta kasance.
I don't know her very well.	Ban san ta sosai ba.
To get it right, it takes a lot of work.	Don samun shi daidai, yana ɗaukar aiki mai yawa.
Of course I saw that.	Tabbas na ga haka.
If not, anyone can tell.	Idan ba haka ba, kowa zai iya fada.
It was easy.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi.
It was a lot of things.	Ya kasance abubuwa da yawa.
Only you can make those decisions and live with them.	Kai kaɗai ne za ka iya yanke waɗannan shawarar kuma ka zauna tare da su.
Let me show you.	Bari in nuna muku.
He traveled a lot.	Ya yi tafiya da yawa.
I want to make sure it suits you first.	Ina so in tabbatar ya dace da ku da farko.
When it comes to that.	Idan ya zo ga haka.
How things have changed.	Yadda abubuwa suka canza.
However, it is there.	Duk da haka, yana nan.
You don't see anyone.	Ba ka ganin kowa.
There can only be one person.	Mutum daya ne kawai zai iya zama.
She thought she would do well with him.	Ta yi tunanin za ta yi kyau da shi.
Then one night he did not return.	Sai wata dare bai dawo ba.
I am a real role model.	Ni ainihin abin koyi ne.
Very nice maybe.	A matukar kyau watakila.
And little by little, it's true.	Kuma kadan kadan, gaskiya ne.
The boat is not much of a pleasure boat for us.	Jirgin ba shi da yawa na jirgin ruwan jin daɗi a gare mu.
I do not know what will happen otherwise.	Ban san abin da zai faru ba in ba haka ba.
We would go there and walk and talk.	Za mu je can mu yi tafiya mu yi magana.
Did you see this man, policeman?	Dan sanda ka ga mutumin nan?
But it must be said.	Amma dole ne a ce.
The same was true wherever he went.	Haka ya kasance duk inda ya shiga.
Sometimes they will shout at each other again.	Wani lokaci kuma za su yi ƙara da juna kuma.
No one looks so comfortable.	Babu wanda yayi kama da dadi.
She was able to return home safely.	Ta samu ta koma gida lafiya.
Maybe you are tired of hearing that.	Wataƙila kun gaji da jin haka.
Come in the morning you should be yourself.	Zo da safe yakamata ku zama kanku.
And it will all fly backwards.	Kuma duk zai tashi baya.
It is well written a little new.	An rubuta shi da kyau ɗan sabon abu.
People rarely do things for you.	Da wuya mutane suke yin abubuwa saboda ku.
Sometimes, we think that's bigger.	Wani lokaci, muna tsammanin abin da ya fi girma ke nan.
Surprisingly it grew so much.	Abin mamaki ya yi girma sosai.
Be there.	Ku kasance a can.
That is what we should do.	Abin da ya kamata mu yi ke nan.
Go on living.	Ci gaba da rayuwa.
She took care of everything.	Ta kula da komai.
The car stopped.	Motar ta tsaya.
He keeps walking.	Yana ci gaba da tafiya.
She doesn't want to laugh now.	Bata son dariya yanzu.
The book was very interesting.	Littafin ya kasance mai ban sha'awa.
We can cut it.	Za mu iya yanke shi.
So let's.	Don haka bari.
Not all is well.	Ba duka lafiya ba.
Not only this.	Ba wannan kadai ba.
One true night.	Daren gaskiya daya.
I think that explains it.	Ina tsammanin hakan ya bayyana shi.
Everyone knows, but not me.	Kowa ya sani, amma ba ni ba.
I have never tried it.	Ban taba gwada shi ba.
It's just mine.	Nawa ne kawai.
Somehow you will know these things again.	Ko ta yaya za ku sake sanin waɗannan abubuwa.
He really liked it.	Ya so shi sosai.
Now think about other things.	Yanzu ka yi tunani a kan sauran abubuwa.
They will be safe.	Za su kasance lafiya.
You've definitely come up with some interesting ideas.	Lallai kun kawo wasu abubuwa masu ban sha'awa.
Another day, this is what he needs.	Wata rana kuma, abin da yake bukata ke nan.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Babu abin da za ku iya yi game da hakan.
Immediately she wanted to do it.	Nan take ta so ya yi.
It takes a while.	Yana ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
It's hard to call.	Yana da wuya a kira.
So they do what they can.	Don haka suna yin abin da za su iya.
I really like the program.	Ina matukar son shirin.
It is not difficult.	Ba wuya.
This is so for people.	Wannan haka yake ga mutane.
However, here we are.	Duk da haka, ga mu nan.
People may be injured, or killed.	Mutane na iya ji rauni, ko kuma a kashe su.
I'm trying	Ina ƙoƙari
If you die, you will die.	Idan ka mutu, za ka mutu.
He walked fast, but he did not run.	Ya yi tafiya da sauri, amma bai gudu ba.
But he will, he hopes.	Amma zai, ya yi fata.
I plan to take advantage of the opportunity to go.	Ina shirin yin amfani da damar da zan tafi.
Catch it! 	Kama shi!
She said.	Ta ce.
I completely failed to get up.	Gaba daya na kasa tashi.
But do it properly.	Amma ku yi yadda ya kamata.
To catch a flight.	Don kama jirgin.
You have to fly above them.	Dole ne ku tashi sama da su.
Tell her I am.	Ka gaya mata ni ne.
How fast things have changed.	Yaya sauri abubuwa suka canza.
So good.	Don haka yayi kyau.
I haven't done that yet.	Ban ci gaba haka ba tukuna.
Not finished.	Ba a gama ba.
We will win.	Za mu ci nasara.
I know how long it has been.	Na san nawa ya kasance.
I sat in it.	Na zauna a ciki.
Everyone hates me.	Kowa ya ƙi ni.
But that is not true.	Amma hakan ba gaskiya bane.
Some things you only need to do once.	Wasu abubuwan da kuke buƙatar yi sau ɗaya kawai.
You stand back.	Kun tsaya baya.
But not in time.	Amma ba ta cikin lokaci.
No one can tell us no.	Babu wanda zai iya gaya mana a'a.
We fit together somehow.	Mun dace tare ko ta yaya.
Nothing to do, nothing to do.	Babu abin yi, babu abin da za a yi.
Remove things that no one cares about.	Cire abubuwan da babu wanda ya damu da su.
We are watching the game.	Muna kallon wasan.
This is the house she grew up in.	Nan ne gidan da ta girma.
People have grown up for us.	Mutane sun girma zuwa gare mu.
I stayed.	Na zauna.
We cannot do that without them.	Ba za mu iya yin hakan ba tare da su ba.
We never liked it.	Ba mu taba son shi ba.
But slowly, slowly.	Amma a hankali, a hankali.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
Funny you have one.	Abin dariya kuna da daya.
Do not be such a child.	Kar ku zama irin wannan yaro.
She tried but could not speak.	Ta gwada amma ta kasa magana.
So, it's good.	Don haka, yana da kyau.
But it is not.	Amma ba shi ba.
They said they would never come to us, not now.	Suka ce ba za su taba zo mana ba, ba yanzu ba.
One or two should do.	Daya ko biyu ya kamata su yi.
Success is all.	Nasara ita ce duka.
Maybe he found a way to be happy.	Wataƙila ya sami hanyar yin farin ciki.
Think about it.	Ka yi tunani.
He decided to help the dog.	Ya yanke shawarar taimaka wa kare.
He is not alone.	Ba ya nan kawai.
She's gone for a long time.	Ta dade da tafi.
And he will tell me.	Kuma zai gaya mani.
In fact, of course not.	A gaskiya, tabbas tabbas.
These could not be found.	Ba a iya samun waɗannan ba.
Whether they agree or not, we will win.	Ko ba komai sun yarda ko a'a, za mu ci nasara.
What a trip.	Me tafiya.
Simply, it is wrong.	Kawai, ba daidai ba ne.
Before all this, there is no such thing as a simple life.	Kafin duk wannan, baya lokacin da rayuwa ta kasance mai sauƙi.
Immediately, as follows.	Nan da nan, kamar haka.
And the third.	Kuma na uku.
Himself on the floor.	Kansa a kasa.
Doing everything right, but this thing can still happen.	Yin komai daidai, amma wannan abu na iya faruwa har yanzu.
Or you may not like it.	Ko kuma ba za ku so ta ba.
Leave the things that have not been done to you.	Ka bar abubuwan da ba a yi maka ba.
There are many people looking for this job.	Akwai mutane da yawa da ke neman wannan aikin.
It really made us laugh.	A gaskiya abin ya ba mu dariya.
He continued to study.	Ya ci gaba da karatu.
I'm still trying to figure out what that will be.	Har yanzu ina ƙoƙarin gano ko menene hakan zai kasance.
But please people.	Amma don Allah mutane.
The world will go to man.	Duniya za ta tafi ga mutum.
But he was funny and hilarious.	Amma ya kasance yana da ban dariya da ban dariya.
He stopped eating, thought for a moment, and asked her when.	Ya daina cin abinci, ya dan yi tunani, ya tambaye ta yaushe.
I hope he does.	Ina fata ya yi.
He did not keep it.	Bai ci gaba da shi ba.
Read the book, please.	Karanta littafin, don Allah.
I leave them to him.	Na bar su gare shi.
I only have mine.	Ina da nawa kawai.
I did not answer anything.	Ban amsa komai ba.
I found this help very helpful.	Na sami wannan taimako sosai.
They suffered so much.	Sun sha wahala sosai.
Of course he was right.	Tabbas yayi gaskiya.
It works great.	Yana aiki mai girma.
Someone has to be a different person.	Dole ne wani ya zama mutumin da ba haka ba.
And many agree.	Kuma da yawa sun yarda.
I had to talk to her.	Dole na yi magana da ita.
I see this has happened to a lot of girls here.	Na ga hakan ya faru da 'yan mata da yawa a nan.
We do not know what we will get.	Ba mu san abin da za mu samu ba.
I will do so at the end of it.	Zan yi haka a karshen ta.
However, being ill, she hesitated.	Duk da haka, da yake ba shi da lafiya, ta yi shakka.
And this, as they say, is.	Kuma wannan, kamar yadda suka ce, shi ne.
I think you can work.	Ina tsammanin za ku iya aiki.
They are still not very good.	Har yanzu ba su da kyau sosai.
Check them out !.	Duba su a sama!.
She doesn't like me there.	Ba ta son ni a can.
I was really interested.	Na yi sha'awar gaske.
You too go.	Kai ma ka tafi.
I have to go and sell this.	Dole ne in je in sayar da wannan.
That is not an easy task.	Hakan ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
Let's start with.	Bari mu fara da.
We never liked children.	Ba mu taɓa son yara ba.
However, he did more than that.	Duk da haka, ya yi fiye da haka.
I will stay with the children.	Zan zauna da yara.
It may be simple, but it's not.	Yana iya zama mai sauƙi, amma ba haka ba.
Now I use myself.	Yanzu ina amfani da kaina.
He was really serious.	Ya kasance da gaske da gaske.
Yet he did it about it.	Amma duk da haka shi ne ya yi shi game da hakan.
I don't want to think about anything.	Ba na son yin tunanin komai.
We will wait for you, if you want.	Za mu jira ku, idan kuna so.
I heard that the food was good.	Na ji cewa abincin yana da kyau.
We were careful about that, of course.	Mun yi hankali game da hakan, ba shakka.
I'm trying to do the same thing.	Ina ƙoƙarin yin abu ɗaya ne.
It is a good tool.	Kayan aiki ne mai kyau.
Probably never.	Wataƙila ba zai taɓa faruwa ba.
Delicious food she gave him.	Abinci mai dadi ta ba shi.
But he sees.	Amma yana gani.
He learned to walk alone.	Ya koyi tafiya shi kadai.
He was a child.	Ya kasance yaro.
You can check out this channel.	Kuna iya duba tashar nan.
So let them be.	Don haka bari su kasance.
She lost track of him.	Ta rasa gane shi.
This just helps you keep going one day.	Wannan kawai yana taimaka muku ci gaba da wata rana.
I have nothing to speak to you about.	Ba ni da abin da zan yi magana da ku.
This makes him very human.	Hakan ya sa shi mutum ne sosai.
I got it, but not really.	Na samu shi, amma ba da gaske ba.
I can't play.	Ba zan iya wasa ba.
I just get the money.	Ina samun kuɗin kawai.
He discovered that on the first day they met.	Ya gano cewa a ranar farko da suka hadu.
That's funny.	Abin ban dariya kenan.
Something happened, and he wanted to tell me.	Wani abu ya faru, kuma yana so ya gaya mani.
There is a rainy season.	Akwai lokacin ruwan sama mai yawa.
But he failed her.	Amma ya kasa mata.
There was a noise.	An yi wata kara.
Please stop calling.	Da fatan za a daina kira.
I have something to do.	Ina da abin da zan yi.
He wants to give you a hand.	Yana son ba ku da hannu.
But no one knows this.	Amma babu wanda ya san wannan.
He passed the bus station.	Ya wuce tashar motar.
So he will go.	Don haka zai yi tafiya.
It's too late.	Abin ya wuce shi.
I want to work a little harder.	Ina so in yi aiki kaɗan.
It's very interesting.	Yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
You can not do anything.	Ba za ku iya yin komai ba.
It works well.	Tana aiki da kyau.
There is no time.	Babu lokaci.
It looks so good.	Ya yi kyau sosai.
I know you better.	Na fi ku sani.
They sit and think.	Zaune suke suna tunani.
The dress is too much for her.	Rigar yayi mata yawa.
Here is your shirt.	Ga rigar ku.
Everyone has something to say about it.	Kowa yana da abin da zai ce game da shi.
And, they did.	Kuma, sun yi.
This person.	Wannan mutumin .
One month goes back a year.	Wata daya ya koma shekara.
Or you can play one yourself whenever you want.	Ko kuma kuna iya kunna ɗaya da kanku a duk lokacin da kuke so.
I did not hear it.	Ban ji shi ba.
Tell him that when he leaves, we will not forget him.	Ka gaya masa cewa idan ya tafi, ba za mu manta da shi ba.
He is from another world.	Shi daga wata duniya ne.
Do not look down.	Kar ka kalli kasa.
It won't do very well.	Ba zai yi kyau sosai ba.
So there we are involved.	Don haka a can muna da hannu.
I will return.	Zan koma.
People here live simple lives.	Mutane a nan suna rayuwa mai sauƙi.
There are very few.	Akwai kaɗan kaɗan.
I want to start with one person.	Ina so in fara da mutum ɗaya.
It was then that things started to get interesting.	Daga nan ne abubuwa suka fara fara sha'awa.
They are not very interested.	Ba su da sha'awa sosai.
So do you.	Kai ma haka.
Even if you say nothing.	Ko da ka ce ba komai.
He also helped two.	Ya kuma taimaka biyu.
And it killed me to see you so.	Kuma ya kashe ni ganin ku haka.
He indicated that he would do so.	Ya nuna cewa zai yi hakan.
Basically, honestly I am.	Ainihin, gaskiya ni.
Everything, everything, this is what we are here for.	Komai, komai, abin da muke nan ke nan.
That if he did, he would do it.	Cewa idan ya yi haka, zai yi.
It will help if you are going to cry when the time comes.	Zai taimaka idan za ku yi kuka idan lokacin ya zo.
We thought about that.	Mun yi tunani a kan haka.
Try killing it.	Gwada kashe shi.
She called me and we got into a fight.	Ta kira ni muka yi fada.
I do not know.	Ban san haka ba.
What happened?	Me ya faru?.
You and the next thirty people came.	Kai da mutane talatin na gaba da suka zo.
We are talking about you.	Muna magana ne game da ku.
I learned this from your book.	Na koyi wannan daga littafin ku.
Dining here for dinner.	Masu cin abinci a nan don abincin dare.
Life happens.	Rayuwa tana faruwa.
Everything and everyone.	Komai da kowa.
There is not a single car in all.	Babu mota ko daya a cikin duka.
No one answered.	Babu wanda ya amsa.
That was discovered.	An gano hakan.
Do not be afraid of the unknown.	Kada ku ji tsoron abin da ba a sani ba.
And you can do that.	Kuma kuna iya yin hakan.
Here is what happened.	Sai ga me ya faru.
Even then you can do anything.	Ko da a lokacin za ku iya yin wani abu.
And it works.	Kuma yana aiki.
If they ask him how it is.	Idan sun tambaye shi yadda abin yake.
Of course this will not come as a surprise.	Tabbas wannan ba zai zo da mamaki ba.
They look at each other.	Kallon juna suke.
Get out before he gets home.	Fita yayi kafin ya isa gida.
Make that happen.	Yi hakan ya kasance.
It may rain later.	Zai iya yin ruwan sama daga baya.
Their hopes are dashed.	Fatan su ya yi kasa.
Not surprisingly.	Ba abin mamaki ba ne.
You know where we are going.	Kun san inda za mu.
Call me back.	Kira ni a dawo.
There is also national work.	Akwai kuma aikin kasa.
Just talk to her.	Kawai ka yi magana ta.
To us, it was amazing.	A gare mu, abin mamaki ne.
You are here to help her.	Kuna nan don taimaka mata.
But she said she saw no reason to continue living.	Amma ta ce ba ta ga dalilin ci gaba da rayuwa ba.
But they did well in what they did.	Amma sun yi kyau a abin da suka yi.
Enough is enough.	Ya isa ya isa.
But scare me.	Amma ka bani tsoro.
Nothing more than usual.	Babu fiye da yadda aka saba.
I know she does.	Na san tana yi.
Hope to keep coming back.	Da fatan za a ci gaba da zuwa.
Which she probably can’t do with me.	Wanda watakila ba za ta iya yi da ni ba.
There is very little food available.	Akwai abinci kaɗan da za a samu.
Now the mind is up.	Yanzu hankali ya tashi.
And many more.	Wasu da yawa kuma.
So, see.	Don haka, gani.
It was too late.	A lokacin ya makara.
I watch this right in time.	Ina kallon wannan daidai lokacin cikin lokaci.
It's an interesting thing.	Abu ne mai ban sha'awa.
It will not rise.	Ba zai tashi ba.
Who lives here?	Wanene ke zaune a nan?
We work like this.	Muna aiki kamar haka.
It's fun, of course, but it's not a big deal.	Abin farin ciki ne, tabbas, amma ba babban abu ba.
Let them go.	Su tafi.
Productivity is not for nothing.	Yawan aiki ba don komai ba.
I decided to add them to it.	Na yanke shawarar ƙara su a ciki.
They should know.	Ya kamata su sani.
And it’s good if you’re good.	Kuma yana da kyau idan kuna da kyau.
I'll try that.	zan gwada hakan.
And they are not in the best place.	Kuma ba su kasance a wuri mafi kyau ba.
This is.	Wannan shine .
The same is true at school for me.	Haka abin yake a makaranta gare ni.
Let it cool.	Bari yayi sanyi.
Once in a while, it may not be about the money.	Sau ɗaya, yana iya zama ba game da kuɗin ba.
That's the way it is.	Haka abin yake.
That alone is a joy.	Wannan kadai abin farin ciki ne.
On it can come at the right time.	An kunna shi zai iya zuwa daidai lokacin.
But he had to speak.	Amma dole ne ya yi magana.
I like a lot of things	Ina son abubuwa da yawa
Be with you.	A tare da ku.
It’s quick to know if the signature is good or if we don’t.	Yana da sauri don sanin ko sa hannu da kyau ko kuma idan ba mu yi ba.
I want to be	Ina so in zama
He explained everything.	Ya bayyana komai.
Can do anything.	Iya yin komai.
I could not understand why this had to happen.	Na kasa gane dalilin da yasa dole wannan abu ya faru.
Sounds great today.	Ji sosai a yau.
This statement is incorrect.	Wannan magana ba daidai ba ce.
The second problem is insomnia.	Matsala ta biyu ita ce rashin barci.
He spoke.	Yayi magana.
He had never seen it before.	Ya taba gani a baya.
I will read the article again.	Zan sake karanta labarin.
I'll take this.	Zan dauki wannan.
It's cut here.	Yana da yanke a nan.
No one will talk to you.	Babu wanda zai yi magana da ku.
Just because I can.	Kawai saboda zan iya.
You are familiar with this program.	Kun saba da wannan shirin.
He has never been married.	Bai taba yin aure ba.
It should be up now.	Kamata ya yi a tashi a yanzu.
I assume this is unknown.	Na dauka wannan ba sani ba ne.
They laughed at her.	Dariya suka saka mata.
You need to know.	Kuna buƙatar sani.
He did not know what to do with it all.	Bai san me zai yi da shi duka ba.
I will tell her whatever comes our way.	Zan yi mata fada komai ya zo mana.
What would you do if you were given this money?	Me za ku yi idan aka ba ku wannan kuɗin?
I went to your house.	Na je gidan ku.
The room is too hot.	Dakin yayi zafi sosai.
I finished second.	Na gama na biyu.
It is larger than the others, though not much.	Ya fi sauran girma, ko da yake ba da yawa ba.
What will people think of you?	Me mutane za su yi tunanin ku?
I did more than anyone would.	Na yi fiye da yadda kowa zai yi.
This is one of the things we say.	Wannan shi ne daya daga cikin abubuwan da muke fada.
He was surprised and surprised.	Ya yi mamaki da ya yi mamaki.
It's not very good.	Ba shi da kyau sosai.
If.	A idan.
I know how real this can feel.	Na san yadda ainihin wannan zai iya ji.
I do not know where he caught them.	Ban san inda ya kama su ba.
But it will not be.	Amma ba zai zama ba.
It's amazing.	Abin mamaki ne.
He did not run.	Bai gudu ba.
And so he died.	Kuma haka ya mutu.
It looks amazing.	Yana kama da ban mamaki.
We can't fight.	Ba za mu iya yin fada ba.
After two years she was ready to go.	Bayan shekara biyu ta shirya ta shiga.
She even called the police on me.	Har ta kira ’yan sanda a kaina.
Which is good.	Wanda yayi kyau.
That great pain is life.	Wannan babban zafi shine rayuwa.
You are right on your way.	Kuna daidai a hanyar ku.
Nothing, nothing, leave.	Babu wani abu, babu komai, bar.
It must be very similar.	Dole ne ya kasance kama sosai.
One week ago.	Mako daya da ya wuce.
Let me think more about that.	Bari in kara yin tunani a kan wannan.
He thought he would be fine.	Yayi tunanin zai samu lafiya.
When.	A lokacin da.
The method has always been.	Hanyar ta kasance koyaushe.
It should not be left to you.	Bai kamata a bar muku shi ba.
We cannot do it alone.	Ba za mu iya yin shi kadai ba.
She makes you feel she is there for you.	Ta sa ka ji tana nan a gare ka.
And save the day.	Kuma ajiye ranar.
She was the first to get up.	Ita ce ta fara tashi.
Hope this helped !.	Da fatan wannan ya taimaka!.
This, and because he asked me.	Wannan, kuma saboda ya tambaye ni.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
The sun was about to rise.	Rana ta kusan fita daga sama.
She waits as she walks.	Tana jira tana tafiya.
But there is more to it than that.	Amma akwai fiye da haka.
I heard that.	Na ji haka.
I know better than to let this happen.	Na fi sani fiye da bari wannan ya faru.
Great.	Babban.
Looking to try it this weekend.	Neman gwada shi a wannan karshen mako.
And we hope you come back.	Kuma muna fatan za ku dawo.
He really needs help with that.	Lallai yana buƙatar taimako akan wannan.
Years ago, someone told me about this place.	Shekaru da suka wuce, wani ya gaya mani game da wannan wuri.
What a joy she felt.	Wani irin farin ciki ta ji.
It will not change it.	Ba zai canza shi ba.
Maybe a little.	Wataƙila kadan.
I can't hear a word.	Ba zan iya jin wata magana ba.
Such a car, however.	Irin mota, duk da haka.
Is this correct and please can you explain somehow.	Shin wannan daidai ne kuma don Allah za ku iya bayyana ko ta yaya.
This is a surprise now.	Wannan abin mamaki ne yanzu.
I could not sit up straight.	Na kasa zaune har kasa.
Maybe they didn't say anything.	Wataƙila ba su ce komai ba.
I don't want to lose sight of it.	Ba na son barin gani.
No matter who I am.	Ko da wane ne ni.
Nothing is known about them.	Ba a san komai game da su ba.
We have you here.	Muna da kai a nan.
But they did not tell us anything.	Amma ba su gaya mana komai ba.
There must be a better way.	Dole ne a sami hanya mafi kyau.
I did it once and I did too.	Na yi sau ɗaya kuma na yi ma.
Others think so.	Sauran tunanin haka suke.
Maybe your truck is full.	Watakila babban motar ku yana cika.
Sometimes we like it, sometimes not.	Wani lokaci muna son shi, wani lokacin a'a.
I will do it for my child.	Zan yi wa yaro na.
It is time to shut them down.	Lokaci ya yi da za a rufe su.
We are looking forward to another amazing weekend.	Muna jiran wani karshen mako mai ban mamaki.
This person did not.	Wannan mutumin bai yi ba.
And he is also growing up for me.	Kuma shi ma yana girma saboda ni.
This is real life.	Wannan ita ce rayuwa ta gaske.
And she wanted to.	Kuma ta so.
I have to do what they tell me to do.	Dole ne in yi abin da suka ce in yi.
Well, so people are happy.	Da kyau, don haka mutane suna farin ciki.
But everyone was on their own with them, you know.	Amma kowa ya kasance da kansa tare da su, ka sani.
This can be surprising.	Wannan na iya zama abin ban mamaki.
I don't know why he did it, but he did very well.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa ya yi haka ba, amma ya yi kyau sosai.
Of course I agree with that.	Tabbas na yarda da wannan.
I can't wait with you.	Ba zan iya jira tare da ku ba.
He had to get involved with her.	Dole ne ya shiga tare da ita.
We have nothing to eat.	Ba mu da abin da za mu ci.
He began to trust himself.	Ya fara yarda da kansa.
Great desire to succeed in life.	Babban sha'awar yin nasara a rayuwa.
But that cannot happen.	Amma hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
But not more than one.	Amma bai fi daya ba.
She wanted to hurry.	Ta so yayi sauri.
And no one is told what he is working on.	Kuma ba a gaya wa kowa abin da yake aiki a kai.
You do it again.	Kuna sake yin ta.
I was among many people.	Na kasance cikin mutane da yawa.
It started really well.	An fara da kyau sosai.
I have the opportunity to do anything.	Ina da damar yin komai.
I do not know when you will be.	Ban san lokacin da za ku kasance ba.
I haven't done that yet.	Ban yi haka ba tukuna.
I still feel it today.	Har yanzu ina ji da ita a yau.
The reader is left wondering.	An bar mai karatu yana mamaki.
Wear a nice dress.	Saka riga mai kyau.
It's not new, but it's not real.	Ba sabon abu ba ne, amma kuma ba da gaske ba ne.
Or doing something.	Ko yin wani abu.
Or it may be removed from you.	Ko kuma an cire ta daga gare ku.
It didn't look like it.	Bai yi kamar ba.
From the beginning, it was a strange thing.	Tun daga farko, wani abu ne mai ban mamaki.
Let's first see why.	Bari mu fara ganin dalilin.
They met the other day.	Sun hadu a ranar da ta gabata.
I do not look up.	Ba na kallon sama.
I really don't want to sell myself.	A gaskiya ba na son sayar da ni.
I can't think of anyone else.	Ba zan iya tunanin wani ba.
Not necessarily for children.	Ba lallai ba ne ga yara.
His head hurts.	Kansa ya yi zafi.
I'm sure she'll like it.	Na tabbata za ta so shi.
I will do this over the weekend.	Zan yi hakan a karshen mako.
I can't sit still.	Ba zan iya zama ba.
Policeman, he loves the police force.	Dan sanda, yana son ’yan sanda.
None of these things.	Babu wani abu daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan.
He also knows where he lives.	Shi ma ya san inda yake zaune.
Everyone loves money.	Kowa yana son kudi.
People will die.	Mutane za su mutu.
I do not agree with this.	Ban yarda da wannan ba.
Here is what happened.	Abin da ke faruwa ke nan.
From you.	Daga wurin ku.
Nothing could be easier.	Babu wani abu da zai zama mai sauƙi.
We break down, get a job.	Muna karya kai, samun aikin yi.
I will be the last person I will stand by.	Zan zama mutum na ƙarshe da zan tsaya a kusa.
She was scared.	Ta ji tsoro.
The crowd was overwhelming.	Lallai taron ya yi yawa.
And in the world, they often tell me now.	Kuma a duniya, sau da yawa suna gaya mini yanzu.
You do not want them to swim around them.	Ba ku son su yi iyo a kusa da su.
No, not only that.	A'a, ba haka kawai ba.
But it is not.	Amma ba haka ba.
They are being repaired.	Ana gyara su.
Some things are necessary.	Wasu abubuwa sun zama dole.
We feel comfortable.	Muna jin dadi.
It doesn't suit me very well.	Bai dace da ni sosai ba.
They love to travel.	Suna son tafiya.
That's what she wants.	Abin da take so kenan.
I hope a lot of that can’t be.	Ina fata da yawa wanda ba zai iya zama ba.
I am at school.	Ina makaranta.
He will see this through.	Zai ga wannan ta hanyar.
I hope you do not.	Ina fata ba za ku yi haka ba.
However, he gave her food for thought.	Duk da haka, ya ba ta abinci don tunani.
It's funny how that hasn't changed.	Abin ban dariya yadda hakan bai canza ba.
I'll call you in a day or three.	Zan kira ku nan da kwana ɗaya ko uku.
Tell me.	Ku gaya mani.
I just heard that.	Na ji haka kawai.
Not you.	Ba kai bane.
There is no point in fighting over this.	Babu wani amfani fada akan wannan.
He seemed ill.	Ya yi kamar ba shi da lafiya.
They will continue to play a lot.	Za su ci gaba da wasa da yawa.
That happened, and so did the people.	Hakan ya faru, kuma shi ya sa mutane suka ci gaba da ƙoƙari.
They are given.	Ana ba su.
He didn't want to call me that.	Bai so ya kira ni da wannan labarin ba.
I will just add this.	Zan ƙara wannan kawai.
I do not understand her.	Ban gane ta ba.
You are surprised.	Kuna mamaki.
Next time we see each other, we will sign.	Nan gaba idan muka ga juna, za mu sanya hannu.
You may even be familiar with it.	Kuna iya ma saba da shi.
When they came out they were ready.	Da suka fito suka shirya.
Throughout.	Duk lokacin.
He later returned and married her.	Ya dawo daga baya ya aure ta.
It worked once in a while.	Yayi aiki sau ɗaya a ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
He wanted to continue to grow.	Ya so ya ci gaba da girma.
Like today.	Kamar yau.
They make you sleepy.	Suna sa ku barci.
He does it himself.	Shi kansa yake yi.
It plays amazing.	Yana wasa ban mamaki.
This is a good thing for the mind.	Wannan abu ne mai kyau na hankali.
That did not happen.	Hakan bai faru ba.
Can't run.	Ba za a iya cin gudu ba.
He should be worried.	Ya kamata ya damu.
You do not know who you are.	Baka san ko wanene kai ba.
And he certainly did.	Kuma lallai ya yi haka.
But it is a miracle.	Amma abin mamaki ne.
That was it.	Abin da ya kasance kenan.
The road is still unsafe.	Har yanzu hanyar ba ta da lafiya.
I was the only one.	Ni kadai ke nan.
You know me better than that, however.	Kun san ni fiye da haka, duk da haka.
But it will help many others.	Amma za ta taimaka da yawa wasu.
I was not ready.	Ban shirya ba.
By doing so, you will do the right thing.	Yin haka, za ku yi abin da ya dace.
People smoke and drink everywhere and at all times.	Mutane suna shan taba kuma suna sha a duk inda kuma a kowane lokaci.
You had better go without us.	Gara ka tafi ba tare da mu ba.
Don't you understand?	Ba ku gane ba ko?
Unemployment here is low.	Yawan rashin aikin yi a nan ya yi kadan.
They need some nutritious food.	Suna buƙatar wasu kayan abinci na abinci.
That they did not.	Cewa ba su yi ba.
The work is done.	An yi aikin.
What do they know?	Me suka sani?.
It's just there.	Yana can kawai.
I do not know what.	Ban san me ba.
Don't even think about it.	Kada ya ma yi tunani.
I have a problem with something.	Ina da wahala da wani abu.
You can take any money you want.	Kuna iya ɗaukar duk kuɗin da kuke so.
Here he comes again.	Nan ya sake zuwa.
Continue not to go.	Ci gaba da ba su tafi.
You can not miss it.	Ba za ku iya rasa shi ba.
This should help you.	Wannan ya kamata ya taimake ku.
However, it is definitely more than that.	Duk da haka, tabbas ya fi haka.
He got up and got up.	Ya tashi ya tashi.
But she is not like that, she is not.	Amma ita ba irin wannan ba ce, ba ita ba ce.
We will never know.	Ba za mu taɓa sanin hakan ba.
Work all week and stay home on the weekends.	Yi aiki duk mako kuma ku zauna a gida a karshen mako.
The last resort is appropriate here.	Hanya ta ƙarshe ta dace a nan.
He loves you so much, so much.	Yana son ku sosai, sosai.
It can be just one day in life.	Yana iya zama rana ɗaya kawai a rayuwa.
I do not feel it is too much.	Bana jin yana da yawa.
Since then he has not been a single dog.	Tun daga nan bai zama kare daya ba.
He should remember to sleep with her again.	Ya kamata ya tuna ya sake kwana da ita.
Now is your time.	Yanzu lokacin ku ne.
But this is it.	Amma wannan shi ne.
They will not go into battle.	Ba za su shiga cikin fada ba.
I do not know what I am doing wrong.	Ban san abin da nake yi ba daidai ba.
We move on, which is good.	Muna ci gaba, wanda yake da kyau.
Everyone is scared.	Kowa ya ji tsoro.
They are not fun!	Ba su da daɗi!
He wanted a child.	Ya so yaro.
But sometimes you have to look ahead.	Amma wani lokacin dole ne ku duba gaba.
I want him to feel my pain.	Ina so ya ji zafi na.
they were amazed.	suka yi mamaki.
I remember the day it happened.	Na tuna ranar da abin ya faru.
There are many that he did not talk about.	Akwai da yawa da bai yi magana a kai ba.
I know you laughed, but you still signed.	Na san kun yi dariya, amma har yanzu kun sa hannu.
Get out of the way.	Fita ta hanya.
And he is wearing a shirt.	Kuma yana sanye da riga.
It seems to work.	Da alama ya yi aiki.
But somehow he did.	Amma ko ta yaya ya yi.
Some of you will.	Wasu daga ciki za ku.
We want to touch it, we want to touch it.	Muna so mu taba, muna so mu taba shi.
This is happening today.	Wannan yana faruwa a yau.
I think that is good.	Ina ganin hakan yayi kyau.
I do not like it on my own.	Ba na son shi a kaina.
I do not like it you can have it.	Ba na son shi za ku iya samun shi.
Harassment.	Dama.
Two women live in the same house.	Mata biyu suna zaune a gidan.
Do not stay in it.	Kada ku zauna a ciki.
Every time, there is a problem.	Kowane lokaci, akwai matsala.
I do not see anything new about that.	Ban ga wani sabon abu game da hakan ba.
You are coming with us.	Kuna zuwa tare da mu.
I will tell you the truth.	Zan gaya muku gaskiya.
If they get it they will respond to you anytime.	Idan sun samu za su amsa muku kowane lokaci.
But almost.	Amma kusan kusan.
I will tell you the truth.	Zan gaya muku gaskiya.
I'll wait.	Zan jira.
That did not fix the problem.	Wannan bai gyara matsalar ba.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
We have known for a long time.	Mun dade mun sani.
I have to go now.	Dole ne in tafi yanzu.
We must be careful.	Dole ne mu yi hankali.
There is a similarity.	Akwai kama wannan.
So it can’t be too much.	Don haka ba zai iya zama da yawa ba.
There is still time to go.	Har yanzu akwai sauran lokacin da za ku tafi.
Such an amazing place.	Irin wannan wuri mai ban mamaki.
I was in that.	Na kasance cikin wannan.
He talked about that.	Ya yi magana a kan haka.
You know what time it is for kids.	Kun san yadda lokaci yake ga yara.
Yet not a single person was lost that night.	Amma duk da haka ba a rasa mutum ɗaya a wannan dare ba.
He is still swimming.	Har yanzu ya yi iyo.
I want to continue.	Ina so in ci gaba.
I will leave you to him.	Zan bar ku gare shi.
It is good to know you.	Yayi kyau sanin ku.
It just isn't.	Kawai ba haka bane.
He will take care of you.	Zai kula da ku.
He did nothing to her.	Bai yi mata komai ba.
And we did not miss them.	Kuma ba mu rasa su ba.
Do not be afraid.	Kada ku ji tsoro.
We can still see each other even when we are not working together.	Har yanzu za mu ga juna ko da ba a aiki tare.
I do not have that much money.	Ba ni da kuɗin da yawa haka.
Your best stuff.	Mafi kyawun kayan ku.
You are not allowed to do that.	Ba a ba da damar yin hakan ba.
I do not even have a name.	Ban ma da suna.
No one knows what she did there alone.	Ba wanda ya san abin da ta yi a can ita kadai.
You got up early with us, you know.	Kun tashi da mu da wuri, kun sani.
But she also knows that life is not always easy.	Amma ta san cewa rayuwa ba koyaushe ba ta dace ba.
The sun is very hot.	Rana ta yi zafi sosai.
Maybe it shows where it shouldn’t.	Wataƙila ta nuna inda bai kamata ba.
He is lost.	Ya bata.
We will be killed or we will win.	Za a kashe mu ko mu yi nasara.
He should not be here, he should not even be here.	Bai kamata ya kasance a nan ba, bai kamata ma ya kasance a nan ba.
It continues.	Yana ci gaba.
You can get up now.	Kuna iya tashi yanzu.
I went this weekend.	Na tafi wannan karshen mako.
I have not seen this before.	Ban ga wannan a da ba.
You know it's coming.	Kun san yana zuwa.
It can take.	Zai iya ɗauka.
Maybe you can do better.	Wataƙila za ku iya yin mafi kyau.
I didn’t think that would work.	Ban yi tunanin hakan zai yi aiki ba.
I don't know where it will be.	Ban san inda zata kasance ba.
So far, I have one.	Ya zuwa yanzu, ina da daya.
He has worked here since leaving school.	Ya yi aiki a nan tun barin makaranta.
It wouldn’t be a surprise for them, though it does for you.	Ba zai zama da ban mamaki a gare su ba, ko da yake yana yi muku.
No wonder there perhaps.	Babu mamaki a can watakila.
He has never done that before.	Bai taɓa yin hakan ba tukuna.
I’ve never had anything of my own.	Ban taba samun wani abu na kaina ba.
And they will be right.	Kuma za su yi gaskiya.
The next problem is getting a boat.	Matsala ta gaba ita ce samun jirgin ruwa.
I asked what?	Na tambayi me?
Help yourself to everything in it.	Taimaka wa kanku ga duk abin da ke cikin .
I do not know what they are thinking.	Ban san abin da suke tunani ba.
She heard everything.	Ta ji komai.
I want to forget.	Ina so in manta.
No one is driving.	Babu wanda ke tuƙi.
The next thing you need to do is work.	Magana ta gaba da kuke buƙatar yin aiki ce.
I could be on the road, though.	Zan iya zama kan hanya, ko da yake.
Something about it is all wrong.	Wani abu game da shi duk ba daidai ba ne.
Suddenly, no longer healthy.	Nan da nan, ba lafiya, ba kuma.
I don't like it here, you know.	Ba na son shi a nan, ka sani.
From sight, from mind	Daga gani, daga hankali
I know he knows.	Na san ya sani.
Maybe it's a mistake.	Wataƙila kuskure ne.
Maybe that has changed since then which wouldn’t surprise me.	Wataƙila wannan ya canza tun lokacin wanda ba zai ba ni mamaki ba.
She will never run again.	Ba za ta sake gudu ba.
You do not want to be like him.	Ba ka son ka zama kamar shi.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
I don’t know him much.	Ban san shi da yawa ba.
He will stay there.	Zai tsaya a can.
Whether you know it or not.	Ko kun sani ko ba ku sani ba.
It is not so.	Ba haka ba ne.
But with one thing he was totally successful.	Amma da abu ɗaya da ya kasance mai nasara gaba ɗaya.
They show.	Suna nuna.
I know why you came here.	Na san dalilin da ya sa kuka zo nan.
You tell everyone what to play.	Ku ne ke gaya wa kowa abin da za a yi wasa.
If not, forget it.	Idan ba haka ba, manta da shi.
Ask who will know.	Tambayi wanda zai sani.
Obviously, he did not know what to do.	Babu shakka, bai san abin da zai yi ba.
All you want is what you do.	Duk abin da kuke so shi ne abin da za ku yi.
She has two children.	Tana da 'ya'ya biyu.
It will certainly bring a lot of joy.	Tabbas zai kawo farin ciki da yawa.
She added.	Ta kara da cewa.
And they made a mistake.	Kuma suka yi kuskure.
There is no time like now.	Babu lokaci kamar yanzu.
He went to work.	Ya tafi aiki.
It is much healthier.	Ya fi girma lafiya.
It's good to bring that up.	Yana da kyau ta kawo hakan.
It's late.	Gama dare yayi.
It’s beautiful and it’s useful.	Yana da kyau kuma yana da amfani.
Of course you spent a lot of time on this.	Tabbas kun ba da lokaci mai yawa akan wannan.
But I do.	Amma ina yi.
It is good for them.	Yana da kyau a gare su.
And for how much you will save.	Kuma ga nawa za ku ajiye.
Get to know this person better.	Ku ɗan san mutumin nan da kyau.
You do not have to do it by hand.	Ba sai ka yi shi da hannu ba.
Years will do the same.	Shekaru zai yi haka.
They are more than that.	Sun fi haka.
The shirt is off.	Rigar ta kare.
Here is what is shown.	Abin da aka nuna ke nan.
We wanted him to die fast and he did.	Mun so ya mutu da sauri kuma ya yi.
So he suggested this game to me.	Don haka ya ba ni shawarar wannan wasan.
Mistake, little by little.	Kuskure, kadan kadan.
Good quality use.	Kyakkyawan amfani mai kyau.
Everyone wants to play every day.	Kowa yana son yin wasa kowace rana.
The food was very tasty.	Abincin ya yi dadi sosai.
She's not smart but she's smart.	Ba ta da hankali amma tana da hankali.
The first name is good with us.	Sunan farko yana da kyau tare da mu.
Even more so with kids.	Har ma fiye da haka tare da yara.
I don't know exactly how to put it.	Ban san ainihin yadda ake saka shi ba.
Hope to see it better every day.	Da fatan ganin shi mafi kyau kowace rana.
It became my call.	Ya zama kira na.
Always be honest.	Ku kasance masu gaskiya koyaushe.
But for my opinion.	Amma don tunani na.
It shows.	Ya nuna shi.
It will definitely be hot tomorrow.	Tabbas zai yi zafi gobe.
Not from above.	Ba daga sama ba.
It's almost done.	An kusa yi.
So she looked at the material.	Don haka ta duba kayan.
This is not about them.	Wannan ba game da su ba ne.
We do not know who he is.	Ba mu san ko wanene shi ba.
Start the right path.	Fara hanyar da ta dace.
It will pass.	Zata wuce.
I could not even find you at first.	Ban ma iya samun ku da farko ba.
No one has ever seen a thought.	Ba wanda ya taɓa ganin tunani.
The truth is amazing.	Gaskiya abin mamaki ne.
He fell into a trance.	Ya fad'a cikin fad'a.
There is nowhere to drink.	Babu inda za a sha.
I hope they are more successful.	Ina fatan za su kara samun nasara.
Just go right.	Kawai je dama.
I want to turn off my makeup.	Ina so in kashe kayan gyara ta.
I married him, of course.	Na aure shi, tabbas.
They don't care.	Ba su damu ba.
I do not have a car.	Ba ni da mota.
But the story is not all.	Amma labarin ba duka ba ne.
The next night, so.	Dare na gaba, haka.
But she didn't care.	Amma bata damu ba.
It is useless to kill things.	Ba shi da amfani a kashe abubuwa.
He died and a good thing too.	Ya mutu kuma abu mai kyau ma.
But he is tired of it.	Amma ya gaji da ita.
He will do it.	Zai yi shi.
He was years old.	Ya kasance shekaru.
You are the only one.	Kai kaɗai ne.
I need to tell you everything.	Ina bukata in gaya muku komai.
I need to add this extra function.	Ina buƙatar ƙara wannan ƙarin aikin.
Kind of not.	Irin ba.
You will no longer love one another.	Ba za ku ƙara son ɗaya ba.
Leave me wondering.	Ka bar ni ina mamaki.
I really like it.	Ina matukar son sa.
It's too hot.	Yayi zafi sosai.
I can’t think of them any other way.	Ba zan iya tunanin su ta wata hanya ba.
We really like the room.	Muna matukar son dakin.
I will make that happen on time.	Zan sa hakan ya faru a kan lokaci.
Are you sure you want to see this?	Kun tabbata kuna son ganin wannan?
I will be behind you.	Zan kasance a bayan ku.
It really happens.	Da gaske yana faruwa.
It should still be no.	Ya kamata har yanzu ya kasance a'a.
Fortunately, you can say that, and it is.	Abin farin ciki, kuna iya cewa, kuma haka yake.
Some make it work others do not.	Wasu suna sa shi aiki wasu kuma ba sa aiki.
I want to.	Ina so in yi.
No game can.	Babu wasan da zai iya.
But to no avail, he thought.	Amma ba wani amfani, ya yi tunani.
Interesting.	Abin sha'awa.
A little for more.	Kadan don ƙarin.
We got water at the time.	Mun samu ruwa a lokacin.
It's good to see that.	Yayi kyau ganin haka.
I want to do the same as she did.	Ina so in yi haka kamar yadda ta yi.
No one should be able to explain why.	Babu wanda ya isa ya bayyana dalilin da ya sa.
That did not work well.	Hakan bai yi kyau ba.
He saw the sun rise.	Ya ga rana ta fito.
Of course they have.	Tabbas suna da.
Just do it.	A yi kawai.
They decided not to wait.	Sun yanke shawarar daina jira.
And many more are coming.	Kuma da yawa suna zuwa.
Pleasures are fun.	Abubuwan jin daɗi suna jin daɗi.
I would call that victory.	Zan kira hakan nasara.
Maybe even better.	Wataƙila ma sun fi kyau.
No one answered.	Babu wanda ya amsa.
I got that opportunity.	Na sami wannan damar.
We are very tired.	Mun gaji sosai.
They kill people.	Suna kashe mutane.
At least not that she knew.	Ko kadan ba cewa ta sani ba.
Wait for an answer.	Jira amsa.
But it is still a joy.	Amma har yanzu abin farin ciki ne.
Nothing to see.	Babu abin gani.
I want you to meet them.	Ina so ku hadu da su.
At that moment, another car was discovered.	A lokacin, an sake gano wata motar.
I thought we were having a good night.	Na dauka muna kwana lafiya.
You can say anything.	Kuna iya cewa komai.
I realized it was my weakness.	Na gane rauni na ne.
She is still very well dressed.	Har yanzu sanye take sosai.
I'm very sorry.	Ina matukar ba kowa hakuri.
You can tell people to do something about it, help me.	Kuna iya gaya wa mutane mu yi wani abu game da wannan, ku taimake ni.
Totally love it.	Gaba ɗaya son shi.
We know little about her.	Mun san kadan game da ita.
We are still not there.	Har yanzu ba mu can ba.
Talk to your doctor.	Yi magana da likitan ku.
Why don’t we use a wedding or event.	Me yasa ba ma amfani da bikin aure ko taron.
How did you allow yourself to experience this horror.	Yaya kuka bar kanku ya sami wannan mummunan.
Hope that helped!	Da fatan hakan ya taimaka!.
I am not a progressive player.	Ni ba dan wasan ci gaba ba ne.
How he wants to get lost there.	Yadda yake so ya bata a can.
I wrote this article with her.	Na rubuta wannan labarin da ita.
That can't be helped.	Ba za a iya taimakon hakan ba.
It's too much.	Ya yi yawa.
She is amazing.	Tana da ban mamaki.
That took a lot of attention.	Cewa ya dauki hankali sosai.
saying.	yana cewa.
I'm better now.	Na fi kyau yanzu.
Something appears to be off.	Wani abu ya bayyana a kashe.
They worked, and they talked about work.	Sun yi aiki, kuma sun yi magana game da aiki.
This can be done up to three times.	Ana iya yin hakan har sau uku.
No need to change these.	Babu buƙatar canza waɗannan.
I know you understand.	Na san ka gane.
They plan to buy a new home next year.	Suna shirin siyan sabon gida shekara mai zuwa.
However, we were all amazed.	Duk da haka, duk mun kasance cikin mamaki.
They should be good and fast.	Ya kamata su kasance masu kyau da sauri.
They, too, have a problem.	Su ma sun sami matsala.
And it is amazing.	Kuma abin mamaki ne.
I have no progress.	Ba ni da wani ci gaba.
The house, he said, would not be the same if I did not give them.	Gidan, ya ce, ba haka ba ne in ba su ba.
It feels good to walk again.	Ya ji dadi sake tafiya.
She did for.	Ta yi don.
Maybe he was scared.	Wataƙila ya kasance yana jin tsoro.
It will be amazing.	Za ta yi ban mamaki.
There is nothing in it.	Babu komai a ciki.
Food is the best thing.	Abinci shine mafi kyawun abu.
It's beautiful and delicious.	Yana da kyau da dadi.
I just heard I came out.	Ji kawai na fito.
Some will like you for it.	Wasu za su so ku don ku.
This should only take a day or two.	Wannan ya kamata ya ɗauki kwana ɗaya ko biyu kawai.
I said a lot and not a lot.	Na ce da yawa kuma ba mafi yawa ba.
It will not be difficult.	Ba zai yi wahala ba.
Everything is fine.	Komai yayi kyau.
I know it in myself.	Na san shi a cikin kaina.
You have to keep going.	Dole ne ku ci gaba.
Something weird to say, isn't it?	Wani abin ban mamaki a ce, ko ba haka ba?
Departure.	Tashi.
He said he understood.	Yace ya gane.
I think it would be ridiculous if they arrested me.	Ina ganin zai zama abin dariya idan sun kama ni.
It would be scary to miss here.	Zai zama mai ban tsoro a rasa a nan.
We explain on that.	Mun bayyana a kan haka.
Start with a few things.	Fara da ƴan abubuwa.
I died wrong.	Na mutu ba daidai ba.
But I want to find a way.	Amma ina son samun wata hanya.
That sounds like a good thing.	Wannan yana kama da wani abu mai kyau.
Actually, this is not true.	A gaskiya, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
I can't do much.	Ba zan iya yin yawa ba.
It's not really enough.	Bai isa ba da gaske.
He cannot make the world.	Ba zai iya sa duniya ta kasance ba.
At the weekend.	A karshen mako.
But, do not miss the end.	Amma, kar a rasa ƙarshe.
If we can do it all, we should be good.	Idan za mu iya yin shi duka, ya kamata mu kasance da kyau.
You can't talk.	Ba za ku iya magana ba.
If they die, move on.	Idan sun mutu, ci gaba.
He was worried about her illness.	Ya damu da rashin lafiya game da ita.
It worked like that.	Ya yi aiki irin wannan.
You will be right.	Za ku yi daidai.
Or they die on the road.	Ko kuma su mutu akan hanya.
And good too.	Kuma mai kyau ma.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
To me they look like.	A gare ni suna kama.
I entered the house.	Na shiga gidan.
They saw right through everything.	Sun ga daidai ta hanyar komai.
And that's what we're trying to do.	Kuma abin da muke ƙoƙarin yi ke nan.
It works really well.	Yana aiki sosai.
He returned and sat down.	Ya koma ya zauna.
I want to be someone.	Ina so in zama wani.
I live nearby.	Na rayuwa a kusa da nan.
We have to go back and be together.	Dole ne mu koma baya mu kasance tare.
It's very good, he said.	Yayi kyau sosai, yace.
The movie is good.	Fim ɗin yayi kyau.
Anything that pleases you.	Duk abin da ya ji daɗi a gare ku.
God made us fit.	Allah yasa mu dace.
Just a child, in fact.	Yaro kawai, a gaskiya.
Someone behind.	Wani a baya.
I looked at them anyway.	Na duba su duk da haka.
That’s there because it can’t be any other way.	Abin da ke akwai saboda ba zai iya zama wata hanya ba.
No problem here.	Babu matsala a nan.
She gave him everything.	Ta ba shi komai.
It's very broad.	Ya fad'a sosai.
If so, keep on laughing.	Idan haka ne, a ci gaba da yin dariya.
We are told that you are honest.	An gaya mana cewa kai mai gaskiya ne.
You heard it.	Kun ji shi.
Are you telling me this is not true?	Kuna gaya mani wannan ba gaskiya bane?
And kind of not.	Kuma irin ba.
We'll just see.	Za mu gani kawai.
I really like it.	Ina son shi na gaske.
He read and waited.	Yayi karatu ya jira.
I got up and went back.	Na tashi na koma baya.
This is only human.	Wannan abin da ke nan na mutane ne kawai.
So tired.	So gaji .
Do not close the door.	Kar a rufe kofar.
I like to do fun things.	Ina son yin abubuwa masu daɗi.
Here she is, eating.	Ga shi kuma tana ci.
She is gone.	Tana nan suka tafi.
I go out to get other groceries.	Ina fita waje don in samu sauran kayan abinci.
You know when it happened to you.	Kuna san lokacin da abin ya faru da ku.
I don't feel right about that.	Ba na jin daidai game da hakan.
No, not kids.	A'a, ba yara ba.
I will remove it.	Zan cire shi.
Before they left he passed home.	Kafin su tafi ya wuce gida.
You just want to.	Kuna so kawai.
I hope it does.	Ina fatan zai yi.
I can't sit still.	Ba zan iya zama ba.
Instantly it really is.	Nan take da gaske yake.
Behind you is growing.	Bayan ku yana girma.
He does not eat.	Ba ya cin abinci.
Let me know the day you got this.	Bari in san ranar da kuka sami wannan.
He will keep thinking about it.	Zai ci gaba da tunani a kai.
It worked.	Ya yi aiki.
He told me no one was interested.	Ya ce mani babu mai sha'awar.
Run and tell someone.	Ku gudu ku gaya wa wani.
You probably won't get another chance.	Wataƙila ba za ku sake samun wata dama ba.
We need to move on.	Muna bukatar mu ci gaba.
Please do not hate me.	Don Allah kar ku ƙi ni.
She joined one and stood.	Ta shiga daya ta tsaya.
To all of you.	Zuwa gare ku duka.
And it comes from somewhere.	Kuma yana zuwa daga wani wuri.
Three things happened today.	Abubuwa uku ne suka faru yau.
It must be done.	Dole ne a yi.
We know what a person looks like.	Mun san yadda mutum yayi kama.
He always thinks of others as happy.	Kullum yana tunanin wasu da farin cikin su.
The boat is sailing.	Jirgin yana tafiya akan ruwa.
Who loves himself.	Wanda shi kansa yake so.
I knew him at the time.	Na san shi a lokacin.
I said let's get started.	Na ce mu fara.
We finished well.	Mun gama da kyau.
I love it.	Ina so shi.
There are so many things we can do.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za mu iya yi.
I can't help it.	Ba zan iya taimaka masa ba.
It is done or it is broken.	An yi ne ko karya.
No one is around.	Babu kowa a kusa.
We can’t imagine how fast this was.	Ba za mu iya tunanin yadda wannan yake da sauri ba.
This is more like local.	Wannan ya fi kama da na gida.
We agree with the plaintiff.	Mun yarda da mai kara.
You have to play with each other.	Dole ne ku yi wasa da juna.
He must go now.	Dole ne ya tafi yanzu.
I did not understand immediately.	Ban gane ba nan take.
It was done.	Sai da aka yi.
No one ever really knew the truth.	Babu wanda ya taɓa sanin gaskiya da gaske.
I opened the book.	Na bude littafin.
People must be told.	Dole ne a gaya wa mutane.
I never knew.	Ban taba sani ba.
I’ve never seen anyone there, though.	Ban taba ganin kowa a can ba, ko da yake.
And this is not true.	Kuma wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Of course I agree.	Tabbas na yarda.
There are really three.	Akwai gaske guda uku.
He could not bring himself to do it.	Ya kasa kawo kansa yayi.
She would love to be there.	Za ta so ta kasance a wurin.
This is gone.	Wannan ya tafi.
God was pleased.	Allah suka ji dadi.
Others have heard it.	Sauran sun ji labarin.
It got hotter.	Ta kara zafi.
You missed something.	Ka rasa wani abu.
I know this is wrong.	Na san wannan ba daidai ba ne.
He did not recognize her, he could not recognize her.	Bai gane ta ba, ya kasa gane ta.
I have not told you again what to say.	Ban sake gaya muku abin da za ku ce ba.
Today he has grown up.	Yau yayi girma.
Nothing to say.	Babu wani abu da za a ce.
Or something named on it.	Ko wani abu mai suna a kansa.
Not much.	Ba yawa.
It will not stop.	Ba zai tsaya ba.
I think we have to wait and see.	Ina tsammanin sai mun jira mu gani.
Drinking coffee is not healthy.	Shan kofi ba shi da lafiya.
The earth was covered with water.	Duniya ta rufe da ruwa.
Make sure you call ahead.	Tabbatar kun kira gaba.
This is what you see.	Abin da kuke gani ke nan.
I'm still crying.	Har yanzu ina kuka.
Who wants the next one.	Wanene yake so na gaba.
Drink this child.	Sha wannan yaro.
I asked what it was and he never told me.	Na tambayi menene shi kuma bai taba fada min ba.
This is still my feeling.	Wannan shine har yanzu ji na.
Okay, but it's published now.	Da kyau, amma an buga shi yanzu.
No one is interested in the past.	Babu wanda ke sha'awar abubuwan da suka gabata.
Entered correctly.	Aka shiga daidai.
She does not want to do anything.	Bata son yin komai.
So, so, so, so, so	Don haka, don haka, don haka, don haka
That's why you have to get it.	Shi ya sa dole ka samu daga gare ta.
However, it still continues for a while.	Duk da haka, har yanzu yana ci gaba da ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
They just sit there and say nothing.	Zaune suke kawai ba su cewa komai.
They took me somewhere.	Sun kai ni wani wuri.
If you are here.	Idan kuna nan.
Fear not, it is only a journey.	Kar ku ji tsoro, tafiya ne kawai.
I take care of you.	Ina kula da ku.
He wanted things to go faster.	Ya so abubuwan da suka faru su yi sauri.
Absolutely.	Babu shakka.
She should be back today.	Ya kamata ta dawo yau.
It's just fear.	Tsoro ne kawai.
Remove this and it will work.	Cire wannan kuma zai yi aiki.
I was fine.	Na kasance lafiya.
You do not know because you have not stopped thinking.	Ba ku sani ba saboda ba ku daina yin tunani ba.
He was always playing at the time.	Ya kasance yana wasa koyaushe a lokacin.
The story did not come as a surprise.	Labarin bai zo da mamaki ba.
Not done, of course.	Ba a gama ba, tabbas.
It is the only thing that makes sense.	Shi ne kawai abin da ya sa hankali.
None.	Babu ko ɗaya.
No one can do that.	Babu wanda zai iya yin hakan.
It wasn’t easy, but it did.	Ba abu mai sauƙi ba, amma ya yi.
I was not surprised.	Ban yi mamaki ba.
For one.	Na daya.
With it, the past will die.	Tare da shi, abubuwan da suka gabata za su mutu.
And that is what you used to do.	Kuma abin da kuka kasance kuna yi ke nan.
This is everyone's favorite.	Wannan shi ne abin da kowa ya fi so.
I don't want you to die.	Bana son ka mutu.
You are doing an amazing job.	Kuna yin aiki mai ban mamaki.
And it will not go.	Kuma ba zai je ba.
No one enters.	Babu mai shiga.
Give it a go.	Ka ba shi hanya.
But he is also planning ahead.	Amma shi ma yana shirin gaba.
So far it hasn’t fit.	Ya zuwa yanzu bai dace ba.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
They will try to get out of everything if they can.	Za su yi ƙoƙari su fita daga komai idan za su iya.
This is a surprise.	Wannan abin mamaki ne.
And you can have them.	Kuma kuna iya samun su.
Get a good night's sleep.	Yi barci mai kyau.
Or to put it another way, start there.	Ko kuma a ce, fara can.
Mind you.	Hankali yayi mata.
What you said may be true.	Abin da ka fada yana iya zama gaskiya.
I hope this can be of some help.	Ina fatan wannan zai iya zama wani taimako.
Maybe you were at work.	Wataƙila kun kasance a wurin aiki.
We thought we did, but we didn’t.	Muna tsammanin muna yi, amma ba mu yi ba.
Let's find out.	Bari mu gano.
I do not know what.	Ban san me ba.
It cannot be true, it cannot be true.	Ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba, ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
It plays really well and is fun.	Yana wasa sosai da kyau da jin daɗi.
He didn't know what and she was worried.	Bai san me kuma ta damu ba.
He does more.	Yana kara yin haka.
I will protect you.	Zan kare ku.
Let no one be afraid.	Kada kowa ya ji tsoro.
We have to run for it.	Dole ne mu yi gudu don shi.
It's amazing all the time.	Yana da ban mamaki kowane lokaci.
Frequent occurrences.	Yawan faruwa.
It was a big blow.	Ya kasance babban rauni.
So they died.	Haka suka mutu.
It's a trip.	Tafiya ce.
If necessary.	Idan dole ne.
Nothing was done.	Ba a yi komai ba.
Just go out.	Fita kawai yayi.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
Read it now.	Karanta shi yanzu.
So more leaving.	Don haka ƙarin barin.
They laugh and cry, just like the rest of us.	Suna dariya suna kuka, kamar sauran mu.
It seems safe for her.	Da alama lafiya a gare ta.
He did it right at the same time.	Ya yi daidai a lokaci guda.
She can't live without me.	Ba za ta iya rayuwa ba tare da ni ba.
I remember thinking how it was.	Na tuna tunanin yadda abin ya kasance.
I don't know how you did it.	Ban san yadda kuka yi ba.
They magnified him.	Sun kara masa girma.
Please, please, please.	Don Allah, don Allah, don Allah.
Now let’s take it seriously.	Yanzu bari mu yi da gaske.
But there are many of us who are concerned.	Amma akwai da yawa daga cikin mu da suka damu.
At the time, it was too much for me.	A lokacin, abin ya yi mini yawa.
I have to work the way it is.	Dole ne in yi aiki yadda aka yi.
I am with you always.	Ina tare da ku koyaushe.
Good try, but no.	Gwada mai kyau, amma a'a.
Which is not a lie.	Wanda ba karya ba.
Whatever he says he will wait.	Duk abin da zai ce zai jira.
He rearranged his belongings.	Ya sake shirya kayan sa.
They saw the ship.	Sun ga jirgin.
I can tell right away.	Zan iya fada nan da nan.
Suddenly there was a noise.	Nan da nan sai aka yi wata kara.
We will see.	Za mu gani.
It's hard to say.	Yana da wuya a ce.
Everyone is walking.	Duk yana tafiya.
You can not kill them.	Ba za ku iya kashe su ba.
Where he will get the best chance.	Inda zai sami mafi kyawun damar.
I said a lot about myself.	Na fada da yawa game da kaina.
But this, of course, is not true.	Amma wannan, ba shakka, ba gaskiya ba ne.
Of course people are upset.	Tabbas mutane sun damu.
What you said hurts so much.	Abin da kuka fada ya yi zafi sosai.
I was out and about.	Na yi waje da kusa.
She could not tell us who he was.	Ta kasa gaya mana wanene shi.
But it was not.	Amma bai kasance ba.
The world is hot.	Duniya tana zafi.
Wait for it.	Ku jira shi.
Do not hurt me.	Kada ku yi wa kaina wuya.
It comes from the front.	Ya zo daga gaba.
I refuse to eat this food.	Na ƙi cin wannan abincin.
Maybe something is not so good.	Wataƙila wani abu ba shi da kyau sosai.
But if you are, let me ask you.	Amma idan kai ne, bari in tambaye ka.
It worked perfectly.	Ya yi aiki daidai.
We were not able to get out.	Ba mu sami damar fita ba.
Bring them to life.	Kawo da su zuwa rai.
But she had to be there.	Amma dole ta kasance a wurin.
Enough to hear.	Ya isa ya ji.
Our car is outside.	Motar mu tana waje.
But it is.	Amma haka yake.
No, that is not fair.	A'a, hakan bai dace ba.
I do this.	Ina yin wannan.
And it is good to think.	Kuma yana da kyau don tunani.
But don't worry.	Amma kar ka damu.
So yes, the person knows how to succeed.	Don haka a, mutumin ya san yadda zai yi nasara.
We can, and we will do it.	Za mu iya, kuma za mu yi shi.
It would be better if you continued.	Zai fi kyau idan kun ci gaba.
No one knows anything.	Babu wanda ya san komai.
We did not talk about other things.	Ba mu yi magana kan wasu abubuwa ba.
He didn't think of anything for years.	Bai yi tunanin komai ba tsawon shekaru.
It is his time.	Lokacin sa ne.
We can win again.	Za mu iya sake yin nasara.
Everything is as it should be.	Komai yana yadda ya kamata.
He prefers to answer.	Yana ganin gara ya amsa.
You have the opportunity to do something positive.	Kuna da damar yin wani abu mai kyau.
This is not all.	Wannan ba duka ba ne.
Best.	Mafi kyau.
Nothing came close.	Babu abin da ya isa kusa.
There is no place of pleasure.	Babu wurin jin daɗi.
To do this, you must know who this is.	Don yin haka, dole ne ku san ko wanene wannan.
But she was not.	Amma ba ta kasance ba.
He made me laugh and cry.	Ya bani dariya da kuka.
All in all.	Duka da duka.
It was made of it.	An yi shi da shi.
Someone has to say.	Dole ne wani ya ce.
Everything was amazing to me.	Duk abin ya ban mamaki a gare ni.
Otherwise, they could not be if they wanted to.	Ban da haka, ba za su iya zama ba idan suna so.
However, it was too late.	Duk da haka ya makara a gare shi.
I have not been like that before.	Ba ni da haka a da.
Remember, you are on your own.	Ka tuna, kuna kan kanku.
The flight was late but waited there.	Jirgin ya makara amma ya jira a can.
And it all happened so fast.	Kuma duk ya faru da sauri.
This is also true for a good answer.	Wannan kuma gaskiya ne ga amsa mai kyau.
He just doesn't want to run.	Ba ya son gudu kawai.
What.	Menene.
I think you are doing a good job.	Ina tsammanin kuna yin kyakkyawan aiki.
I will leave everything as it is.	Zan bar komai kamar yadda yake.
I agree.	Da na yarda.
She wrote a song for fun.	Ta rubuta waƙa don jin daɗi.
He knew it was time.	Ya san lokaci ya yi.
But she did not know it.	Amma ita bata san hakan ba.
But he was not.	Amma bai kasance ba.
You can leave it all night.	Kuna iya barin shi duka dare.
Maybe all of that.	Wataƙila duk waɗannan.
There is no time lost.	Babu lokacin rasa.
That was expected.	An yi tsammanin hakan.
I did it twice.	Na yi shi sau biyu.
It's life.	Rayuwa ce ta yi.
Some say it is against the workers.	Wasu suna cewa yana gaba da masu aiki.
Let's do something fun.	Mu yi wani abu mai daɗi.
No one can help you.	Babu wanda zai iya taimakon ku.
Maybe he is still here.	Wataƙila har yanzu yana nan.
I am just like everyone else.	Ni kamar kowa ne.
Everyone knows what it is and how to kill it.	Kowa ya san abin da yake da kuma yadda za a kashe shi.
We talked and we talked and talked.	Mun yi magana kuma mun yi magana da magana.
Probably none of them.	Wataƙila babu ɗaya daga ciki.
I think you are not there.	Ina tsammanin ba ka can.
That day is here.	Wannan ranar tana nan.
They are not just scared.	Ba su da tsoro kawai.
This is the right time.	Wannan shine lokacin da ya dace.
But it is much more than that.	Amma ya fi haka yawa.
That's right, you know.	Gaskiya ne, ka sani.
So let’s fly their game.	Don haka bari mu tashi wasan su.
It was a happy day for everyone.	Ranar farin ciki ce ga kowa da kowa.
fake.	karya ne.
You do not even know how it happened.	Ba ku ma san yadda abin ya faru ba.
The most amazing thing happened next.	Abu mafi ban mamaki ya faru a gaba.
Come on in, take a look.	Ku zo mu shiga.
Thinking here is the way to go.	Tunanin a nan hanya ce ta hanya.
Why would you?	Me yasa za ku?.
This article will show you how to do just that.	Wannan labarin zai nuna maka yadda ake yin hakan.
This is it.	Wannan ita ce.
I kept thinking we could live with that.	Na yi ta tunanin za mu iya rayuwa da wannan.
Some do not know what to do.	Wasu ba su san abin da za su yi ba.
I have traveled a lot.	Na yi tafiya da yawa.
They didn’t know they were sick today.	Ba su san ba su da lafiya a yau.
Something could happen.	Wani abu na iya faruwa.
It only happened once.	Sau ɗaya kawai ya faru.
No more days.	Babu ranar kuma.
It does though.	Yana yi ko da yake.
From work.	Daga aiki.
He spoke for himself more than others.	Ya yi magana da kansa fiye da wasu.
They feel someone is coming.	Suna jin wani yana zuwa.
This did not help.	Wannan bai taimaka ba.
It will take years and years.	Zai ɗauki shekaru da shekaru.
I know now she hates me.	Na san yanzu ta ƙi ni.
Everyone got it.	Kowa ya samu.
It may surprise.	Yana iya mamaki.
We started living together.	Mun fara zama tare.
It would be a good fight.	Zai zama fada mai kyau.
It feels uncomfortable.	Ya ji ba dadi.
The chances are small.	Damar ta yi kadan.
It was decided to come.	An yanke shawarar zuwa.
Exactly, and that's why you went.	Daidai, kuma shine dalilin da yasa kuka tafi.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
And that seems to be the only way to do it.	Kuma da alama hanya ɗaya ce kawai ta yin hakan.
Come here, come here.	Zo nan, zo nan.
They can and do.	Suna iya kuma yi.
We all know this time will come.	Duk mun san wannan lokacin zai zo.
Heaven and earth are empty.	Sama da kasa ba komai.
Had she known.	Da ta sani.
I think it's really good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau sosai.
That may be true.	Wannan na iya zama gaskiya.
I got it, trust me, but it was very difficult.	Na samu, yarda da ni, amma yana da wahala sosai.
Heads up .	A kula .
You have to wait for it.	Dole ne ku jira shi.
She, too, could not miss him.	Ita ma ba za ta iya rasa shi ba.
But they are still not here.	Amma har yanzu ba su nan.
They seem to have done so without speaking now.	Da alama sun yi hakan ba tare da sun yi magana yanzu ba.
I put them on the plane.	Na sa su a cikin jirgin sama.
As it is.	Kamar yadda yake.
She corrected him.	Ta gyara masa.
But no one.	Amma babu wani.
He told us everything.	Ya gaya mana komai.
He will not stop crying.	Ba zai daina kuka ba.
Try to arrive early.	Yi ƙoƙarin isa nan da wuri.
I started with the front.	Na fara da gaba.
He laughed like a man.	Yayi dariya kamar mutum.
I'm doing well.	Ina yin kyau.
I was working on that but it was cut off.	Ina aiki a kan hakan amma an yanke shi.
No one should say.	Babu wanda ya isa ya ce.
The house has been renovated.	An sake gyara gidan.
I remember that moment like yesterday.	Na tuna wannan lokacin kamar jiya.
Do not break the fly.	Kar a karya tashi.
He knew me and hated me, she said.	Ya san ni kuma ya ƙi ni, in ji ta.
Not for the title.	Ba don take ba.
So it should be a fun day.	Don haka ya kamata ya zama ranar jin daɗi.
I hope to see you one day.	Ina fatan ganin ku wata rana.
Please help if you have done something like this in the past.	Da fatan za a taimaka idan kun yi wani abu kamar wannan a baya.
I love them	Ina son su
Fortunately, they are difficult.	Abin farin ciki, suna da wuya.
It's a very sensible thing.	Abu ne mai ji sosai.
I’m just coming to show this again.	Ina zuwa ne kawai in nuna wannan kuma.
He started to get up.	Ya fara tashi.
But there may be others.	Amma ana iya samun wasu.
It will fix this.	Zata gyara wannan.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lokaci yayi da kuka fara girma.
But we thought we would win.	Amma mun yi tsammanin za mu yi nasara.
I think we should move on.	Ina ganin ya kamata mu ci gaba.
Who said that?	Wa ya ce haka?
We do that here.	Muna yin haka a nan.
Sure, wearing.	Lallai, saka.
I have two of my own.	Ina da biyu na kaina.
We had such an amazing time.	Mun sami irin wannan lokacin mai ban mamaki.
I think you will be careful, seeing that it is your home.	Ina tsammanin za ku yi hankali, ganin cewa gidan ku ne.
It has become one of my favorite tools.	Ya zama ɗaya daga cikin kayan aikin kyau da na fi so.
If they do, or even just because they like it.	Idan sun yi, ko ma don kawai suna son shi.
Plan some things and prepare everyone.	Shirya wasu abubuwa kuma shirya kowa da kowa.
‘The police know who killed him.	‘Yan sanda sun san wanda ya kashe shi.
But, but, but.	Amma, amma, amma.
What he could not live without.	Abin da ba zai iya rayuwa ba tare da shi ba.
I have no one.	Ba ni da kowa.
Good call, not much.	Kyakkyawan kira, ba da yawa ba.
And that is what happened.	Kuma abin da ya faru ke nan.
Apparently no one cared.	Da alama babu wanda ya damu da hakan.
And why wouldn’t they.	Kuma me ya sa ba za su yi ba.
I did nothing with it.	Ban yi komai da shi ba.
We only work at night.	Da dare kawai muke aiki.
She didn't do it.	Ba ta yi ta ba.
You will succeed in the end.	Za ku yi nasara a ƙarshe.
I still do not know what to do.	Har yanzu ban san abin da zan yi ba.
We were just here and nothing happened.	Mu ne kawai a nan kuma babu abin da ya faru.
Leave her house.	Barin ta gidan.
She lives on the beach.	Tana zaune a bakin ruwa.
Everyone has work to do, everyone except her.	Kowa yana da aikin da zai yi, kowa sai ita.
You must get up if you are hit.	Dole ne ku tashi idan an buga ku.
I found out later.	Na gano hakan daga baya.
He did not even look forward.	Ko kadan bai kalli gaba ba.
No one knew there was.	Babu wanda ya san akwai.
No one is at home.	Babu kowa a gida.
As married couples do.	Kamar yadda masu aure suke yi.
I will tell the whole world about you and me.	Zan gaya wa duniya duka game da ku da ni.
He knows who he is.	Shi, ya san ko wanene.
It could be.	Zata iya zama.
So he decided to move on slowly.	Don haka ya yanke shawarar ci gaba a hankali.
I do it every night before I go to bed.	Ina yin shi kowane dare kafin in yi barci.
I have no water with me.	Ba ni da ruwa tare da ni.
We'll talk later.	Sai mu yi magana wani lokaci.
The first train leaves the station on time.	Jirgin kasa na farko yana barin tashar akan lokaci.
If he agrees we use it.	Idan ya yarda muna amfani da shi.
Both at the same time.	Duka a lokaci guda.
He did just that, as many others did.	Haka kawai ya yi, kamar yadda wasu da yawa suka yi.
This is a well-written truth.	Wannan gaskiya ce da aka rubuta sosai.
They continue now.	Suna ci gaba a yanzu.
Anyone can use that.	Kowa na iya amfani da hakan.
This is obtained as follows.	Ana samun wannan kamar haka.
He is so happy.	Yayi matukar farin ciki haka.
It's not too late now.	Bai makara ba yanzu.
It will be much, much better.	Zai zama da yawa, mafi kyau.
I give you money, here.	Ina ba ku kuɗi, a nan.
Who are you, or what do you say,	Ko wanene kai, ko me ka ce,
There is not much to say.	Babu wani abu da yawa da za a ce.
He is tired of them.	Ya gaji da su.
One of my favorite things.	Daya daga cikin abubuwan da na fi so.
Maybe it really is.	Wataƙila yana da gaske.
He sells leather goods.	Ya sayar da kayan fata.
If you are not happy, we are not happy.	Idan ba ku ji daɗi ba, ba mu ji daɗi ba.
He used to fight.	Ya sha fada.
There are so many.	Akwai shi da yawa.
That happened to me thirty years ago.	Hakan ya faru da ni shekaru talatin da suka wuce.
And that should change.	Kuma wannan ya kamata ya canza.
I want you to talk to me.	Ina so ku yi min magana.
Know it for sure.	Ku san shi da tabbas.
I looked once.	Na duba sau ɗaya.
Put on your clothes and go.	Saka rigar ka ka tafi.
I have mine.	Ina da nawa.
At that time.	A wannan lokacin.
That is why it is so beautiful.	Shi ya sa yana da kyau sosai.
It's not funny, it's not good.	Ba abin dariya ba ne, ba shi da kyau.
You're just walking.	Kuna tafiya kawai.
Just this one thing.	Kawai wannan abu daya.
I have annoyed her in the past.	Na bata mata rai a baya.
They really do.	Da gaske suke yi.
You can see it today.	Kuna iya gani yau.
I almost feel like thinking.	Kusan ina jin kuna tunani.
He went.	Ya tafi.
But not you.	Amma ba ku.
I am scared of everything.	Ina da tsoro a komai.
The night is cold.	Dare yayi sanyi.
I can tell people to do things.	Zan iya gaya wa mutane su yi abubuwa.
Ask people.	Tambayi mutane.
You know, it seems you fit.	Ka sani, da alama kun dace.
You have no home money.	Ba ku da kuɗin gida.
So, it's time.	Saboda haka, lokaci ya yi.
They asked me too, you see.	Sun tambaye ni ma, ka gani.
They were amazing.	Sun kasance masu ban mamaki.
However, such a procedure is very difficult.	Duk da haka, irin wannan hanya yana da wahala sosai.
The back door is open.	Kofar baya a bude take.
He seems to have better skin than anyone else.	Da alama yana da kyakkyawan fata fiye da kowa.
I have not forgotten.	Ban manta ba.
It is not new to me.	Ba ma sabon abu ba ne a gare ni.
But your imagination is always greater than the truth.	Amma tunanin ku koyaushe ya fi na gaskiya girma.
I don't kill things.	Ba na kashe abubuwa.
Not at all.	Ba ko kadan ba.
I feel you are fine.	Na ji dadi kana lafiya.
In fact, it seems a little too much for me.	A gaskiya, ga alama kadan kadan a gare ni.
We want health care.	Muna son kula da lafiya.
Here is the amazing truth.	Ga gaskiya mai ban mamaki.
I could never get into one of these things.	Ba zan taɓa iya shiga ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan ba.
She often walks alone.	Sau da yawa tana tafiya ita kaɗai.
He will kill him.	Zai kashe shi.
I still look up.	Har yanzu ina kallon sama.
Your chance will come.	Damar ku zata zo.
So you can try to play a little bit.	Don haka kuna iya ƙoƙarin yin wasa kaɗan kaɗan.
And okay, it does, it makes me uncomfortable.	Kuma lafiya, yana yi, yana sa ni rashin jin daɗi.
And you can not.	Kuma ba za ku iya ba.
Do not talk too much.	Kar a yi magana da yawa.
The night is over.	Dare ya kare.
To this day.	Har zuwa yau.
God, it's amazing.	Allah, abin mamaki ne.
They should not even talk to each other.	Ba a ma kamata su yi magana da juna ba.
It takes you all.	Yana ɗaukar ku gaba ɗaya.
It's time to talk.	Lokaci ya yi da za ku yi magana.
He went on to say that he wanted to take me there.	Ya ci gaba da cewa yana so ya kai ni wurin.
He is not a child.	Shi ba yaro bane.
I never got it.	Ban taba samu ba.
She has not been well for a long time.	Ta dade ba ta da lafiya.
Someone gave everything.	Wani ya ba da komai.
He was alone.	Ya kasance shi kaɗai.
They were all bad.	Sun kasance duk abin da ba shi da kyau.
And they make money.	Kuma kudi suke samu.
It was for the best.	Ya kasance don mafi kyau.
I can turn on the equipment.	Zan iya kunna kayan aiki.
That will happen.	Hakan zai faru.
They do not want to.	Ba sa so.
I want to do something difficult.	Ina so in yi wani abu mai wuya.
They are not even joking.	Ba ma wasa ba.
I tell you it will not be so.	Na ce maka ba haka za ta kasance ba.
In fact, we now know that it was.	A gaskiya ma, yanzu mun san hakan ya kasance.
I would have told her no.	Da na ce mata a'a.
Would you like more coffee?	Kuna son ƙarin kofi?
I wonder how that makes him feel.	Ina mamakin yadda hakan ke sa shi ji.
No one was killed.	Babu wanda aka kashe.
After about two years they came back and said.	Bayan kamar shekara biyu sai suka dawo suka ce.
Let me tell you, it was not safe.	Bari in gaya muku, ba lafiya.
Who let the dog out?	Wanene ya bar kare ya fita?
She used to have something to eat.	Ta kasance tana da abin da za ta ci.
It's good to be back.	Yana da kyau a dawo.
You will love it too.	Za ku so hakan ma.
He hit home.	Ya buga gida.
He wants to do some things, but not much.	Yana son yin wasu abubuwa, amma ba da yawa ba.
I love this moment.	Ina son wannan lokacin.
He should have known.	Ya kamata ya sani.
Save it and let it cool.	Ajiye shi kuma yayi sanyi.
Maybe he was hurt.	Wataƙila ya ji rauni.
I made him swim.	Na sa shi ina iyo.
But she hated me.	Amma ita ta ƙi ni.
And everything is working properly.	Kuma komai yana aiki yadda ya kamata.
But it seems to be working slowly.	Amma da alama yana aiki a hankali.
Not bad and not great.	Ba mummunan ba kuma ba mai girma ba.
This was all very well and everyone enjoyed it.	Wannan duk yayi kyau kuma kowa ya ji daɗi.
The rest of you, let's make a correction.	Sauran ku, mu yi wani gyara.
There is no necklace or collar.	Babu abin wuya ko abin wuya.
I do not know what she is talking about.	Ban san me take magana ba.
It is all the same for us.	Duk daya ce gare mu.
Did you get this?	Shin kun sami wannan?
I want to know everything.	Ina so in san komai.
But nothing.	Amma ba komai.
The others said nothing afterwards.	Sauran ba su ce komai ba bayan haka.
I will take her home now.	Zan kai ta gida yanzu.
I just came back for that.	Na dawo don haka kawai.
They told me it was time to go to sleep.	Suka ce mini lokaci ya yi da zan yi barci.
Nothing will kill him.	Babu wani abu da zai kashe shi.
We don't work, they work.	Ba mu aiki, suna aiki.
She told me all.	Ta gaya mani duka.
It's hard to drive.	Yana da wuya in tuƙi.
He can fulfill it.	Zai iya cika shi.
Do not talk about it.	Kada ku yi magana a kansa.
I should have left it first.	Ya kamata in bar shi tukuna.
Sorry kid.	Yi hakuri yaro.
So, good for them, too !.	Don haka, mai kyau a gare su, kuma!.
So well.	Don haka da kyau.
If only for a while.	Idan kawai na ɗan lokaci.
The favorite wins.	Wanda aka fi so ya ci nasara.
After being given this task, they found it easier.	Bayan an ba su wannan aiki, sun sami sauƙi.
It doesn't seem fair.	Da alama bai dace ba.
He must be close.	Dole ne ya kasance kusa.
She did.	Ta yi hakan.
It would be better to be so.	Zai fi kyau a kasance haka.
And another, on.	Kuma wani, a kan.
This is without a doubt.	Wannan ba tare da faɗa ba.
It goes out.	Yana fita.
You love it so much.	Kuna son shi sosai.
Not up to the task.	Ba har zuwa aikin ba.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
My boat has been repaired.	An gyara jirgin ruwa na.
I'm fine.	Lafiya ta ni.
He has nothing and is instant.	Ba shi da komai kuma yana nan take.
You are amazing.	Kuna da ban mamaki.
I made only two calls.	Na yi kira biyu kawai.
But he is making a mistake.	Amma yana bani kuskure.
This makes them money.	Wannan ya sa su kudi.
I like sitting outside	Ina son zama a waje
The world is like that.	Duniya haka.
Everyone is watching.	Kowa yana kallon kowa.
Maybe you brought it up several times in the first place.	Wataƙila ka dawo da shi sau da yawa da farko.
Hear what they feel.	Ji abin da suke ji.
There is something she does not want you to see.	Akwai abin da ba ta son ku gani.
So useful and useful for me.	Don haka mai amfani kuma mai amfani a gare ni.
You feel great.	Kuna jin girma.
I will too.	Zan kuma.
If nothing else, fly there.	Idan ba komai, tashi a can.
And many will die.	Kuma da yawa za su mutu.
When he arrived, the police were there.	Lokacin da ya isa, 'yan sanda suna can.
If not, they should be.	Idan ba haka ba, ya kamata su kasance.
Please help me to succeed.	Don Allah a taimake ni yadda zan ci nasara.
When we were tired, we started talking.	Da muka gaji muka fara magana.
It's just, 'he said.	Haka kawai,' in ji shi.
I felt like down in it.	Na yi kamar a kasa a cikin ta.
We got nothing.	Ba mu sami komai ba.
Never do that.	Kada ka taɓa yin hakan.
Drive slowly and carefully.	Yi tuƙi a hankali kuma a hankali.
This works well for some people.	Wannan yana aiki da kyau ga wasu mutane.
That was a year ago.	Wannan shi ne shekara daya da ta wuce.
Everyone stopped talking.	Kowa ya tsaya magana.
It is not difficult to find your destination.	Ba abu mai wahala ba ne a sami inda aka kai ku.
Think about the past two years.	Ka yi tunani game da shekaru biyu da suka wuce.
I really do.	Ina da gaske.
Enter	Shiga
I try not to read too much into it.	Ina ƙoƙarin kada in karanta da yawa a cikin hakan.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Da fatan za a gaya mana kadan daga cikin labarin baya.
Little left to access.	Kadan ta bari don samun dama.
They did not arrest me.	Ba su kama ni ba.
I will lower myself and he will do the same.	Zan sa kaina kasa shi ma zai yi.
It has been used only once.	An yi amfani da shi sau ɗaya kawai.
I should go and get it really.	Ya kamata in je in samu da gaske.
That's what's right.	Shine abin da yake daidai.
Now she is gone.	Yanzu ta bata.
Trying to think.	Ƙoƙarin tunani.
She signed.	Ta sa hannu.
It seems useless for me to try.	Da alama ba wani amfani a gare ni in gwada.
This is the wrong approach.	Wannan ita ce hanyar da ba ta dace ba.
This is great.	Wannan yayi kyau.
Travel costs money.	Tafiya tana kashe kuɗi.
Now sit back and enjoy the day.	Yanzu ku zauna ku ji daɗin ranar.
The way is gone.	Hanyar ta tafi.
It has been used in an appropriate way.	An yi amfani da shi ta hanyar da ta dace.
You have no money to make.	Ba ku da kuɗin da za ku yi.
It can do that, however.	Yana iya yin hakan, duk da haka.
We want to do what we want.	Muna so mu yi abin da muke so.
The events were enormous.	Abubuwan da suka faru sun kasance masu girma.
But you are right, really.	Amma kun yi gaskiya, da gaske.
I was not afraid.	Ban ji tsoro ba.
It is not something like that.	Ba wani abu ba ne kamar haka .
You have to be tough.	Dole ne ku kasance da wuya.
There you have it.	Can kuna da shi.
Are you married.	An yi aure.
He will do that.	Zai yi haka.
They will be there in a year.	Za su kasance a can a cikin shekara guda.
She agrees with me.	Ta yarda da ni.
They were very good.	Sun kasance masu kyau sosai.
She was worried about his lack of work.	Ta damu da rashin aikin sa.
It cannot be won, as you feel.	Ba za a iya cin nasara ba, kamar yadda kuke ji.
I think we have to work.	Ina ganin dole ne mu yi aiki.
This is the work of the police.	Wannan aikin 'yan sanda ne.
I'm sure it does.	Na tabbata yana yi.
So do not take them together.	Don haka kada a tafi da su tare.
You will learn what the employer expects of you.	Za ku koyi abin da tsammanin mai aiki ke da shi a gare ku.
You should wait.	Ya kamata ku jira.
No problem.	Ba matsala.
This is not a third world country.	Wannan ba kasa ce ta duniya ta uku ba.
No one should do that.	Bai kamata kowa ya yi haka ba.
I did it, and it's not good.	Na yi shi, kuma ba shi da kyau.
Homework is late.	Aikin gida ya makara.
However, there is more to come.	Duk da haka, akwai sauran da za a samu.
That's scary.	Haka tsoro yake.
It really added.	Ya kara da gaske.
So she said.	Don haka ta ce.
But somewhere on the road we forgot about it.	Amma wani wuri a kan hanya mun manta da shi.
You are not interested in these things.	Ba ku da sha'awar waɗannan abubuwa.
You will never do such a thing.	Ba za ku taɓa yin irin wannan abu ba.
She is so beautiful.	Ta yi kyau sosai.
But there is nothing funny about it.	Amma babu abin ban dariya game da shi.
We think it should be.	Muna ganin yakamata ya kasance.
But it does not happen often.	Amma ba ya faruwa sau da yawa.
I was not very happy about this place.	Ban yi farin ciki sosai game da wannan wurin ba.
And the only thing that does that is man.	Kuma abin da kawai ke yin hakan shine mutum.
Let me think about it and return to you.	Bari in yi tunani a kai in koma gare ku.
He took it well.	Ya dauka da kyau.
I make myself a drink.	Ina sa kaina abin sha.
Take her to your home.	Tafi da ita zuwa gidan ku.
I am one with you.	Ni daya ne da ku.
And it's a great thing.	Kuma abu ne mai girma.
There is no way he would like her.	Babu yadda zai so ta.
They are not even my closest call.	Ba ma kira na kusa ba ne.
The task was simple.	Aikin ya kasance mai sauƙi.
There are others.	Akwai kuma wasu.
Marriage does not change that.	Aure baya canza hakan.
But that is enough.	Amma ya isa haka.
Everything we expected happened.	Duk abubuwan da muke tsammanin sun faru.
Speak slowly.	Yi magana a hankali a hankali.
Let me ask you.	Bari in tambaye ku.
There is certainly no way around it.	Lallai babu wata hanya a kusa da shi.
But there is a time when that will happen.	Amma akwai lokacin da zai isa hakan wata rana.
She ran back upstairs.	Da gudu ta koma sama.
You have no chance of that.	Ba ku da damar hakan.
This is still true.	Wannan har yanzu gaskiya ne.
We want to get things done.	Muna son samun abubuwa.
I am glad, for you, that she has one.	Na yi farin ciki, a gare ku, cewa tana da ɗaya.
You will be fine.	Za ku samu lafiya.
Two children.	Yara biyu.
Not for nothing, but you were great there.	Ba don komai ba, amma kun kasance mai girma a wurin.
Be careful when driving.	Yi hankali lokacin tuƙi.
And know that it is true.	Kuma ku sani cewa gaskiya ne.
I know nothing about it.	Ban san komai game da shi ba.
First of all he doesn't need one.	Da farko ba ya bukatar daya.
We can see what might have happened.	Muna iya ganin abin da watakila ya faru.
I would like one.	Zan iya so daya.
I know you're scared.	Na san kuna tsoro.
We must understand that.	Dole ne mu gane hakan.
All work must be done by myself, alone.	Dole ne a yi duk aikin da kaina, ni kaɗai.
I love you so much.	Ina son ku sosai.
This they are wrong.	Wannan suka ba daidai ba ne.
She said nothing to him.	Bata ce masa komai ba.
Many people are surprised by this.	Mutane da yawa sun yi mamakin wannan.
Life for life.	Rayuwa don rayuwa.
It’s good to be careful about that, though.	Yana da kyau su yi hankali game da wannan, ko da yake.
And they were.	Kuma sun kasance.
I live here now.	Ina zaune a nan yanzu.
I should not say no because we will not answer that.	Bai kamata in ce a'a ba saboda ba za mu amsa wannan ba.
You can't bring me back.	Ba za ku iya dawo da ni ba.
The film was very hilarious.	Fim ɗin ya kasance mai ban dariya sosai.
But it is still true.	Amma duk da haka gaskiya ce.
You need me and I alone.	Kuna buƙatar ni kuma ni kaɗai.
The injured person must prove incapacitated.	Dole ne wanda ya ji rauni ya tabbatar da rashin iya aiki.
You can check as you like.	Kuna iya duba yadda kuke so.
We will start doing it before she pays.	Za mu fara yi tun kafin ta biya.
This is my game.	Wasan nawa kenan.
Obviously, it is wrong.	Babu shakka, ba daidai ba ne.
I looked to see what was happening.	Na duba don ganin me ke faruwa.
He is now a big boy.	Yanzu babban yaro ne.
I hope they can.	Ina fatan za su iya.
I don't really think about anything.	Ba na tunanin komai da gaske.
I can't seem to get over it.	Ba zan iya yin kamar na damu ba.
I'm very scared.	Ina matukar jin tsoro.
There are girls too.	Akwai 'yan mata kuma.
I will read cold.	Zan yi karatu mai sanyi.
I love me	Ina son ni
However, the problem remains.	Duk da haka, matsalar tana nan.
One goes like two.	Daya tafi kamar biyu.
Can you hear me now?	Za ka iya ji na yanzu?
I could not believe he was gone.	Na kasa yarda cewa ya tafi.
Another mistake.	Wani kuskure.
Talk to us.	Yi magana da mu.
You have to give me that too.	Dole ne ku ba ni haka kuma.
I told him about you.	Na gaya masa game da ku.
He said quickly and replied.	Ya fad'a cikin sauri ya amsa.
I can't say much about it here yet.	Ba zan iya cewa da yawa game da shi a nan tukuna.
I could be around someone for a while.	Zan iya zama kusa da wani na ɗan lokaci.
Man does what is right.	Mutum yana yin abin da ya kamata.
With others you will never know.	Tare da wasu ba za ku sani ba.
You need to be smart.	Kuna buƙatar zama mai hankali.
He will stay with me.	Zai zauna tare da ni.
I never wrote one.	Ban taba rubuta daya ba.
He wanted to be at the end of the dress.	Ya so ya kasance a karshen riga.
So let's add.	Don haka bari mu kara da cewa.
They won the fair game.	Sun yi nasara a wasan gaskiya.
The food is good.	Abinci yana da kyau.
It does not work.	Ba haka yake aiki ba.
I live on my own.	Ina rayuwa da kaina.
She left.	Ta tafi.
So it came to pass.	Don haka abin ya kai haka.
He wants to feel her touch.	Yana son jin taba ta.
Go, you.	Ka tafi, ka.
Give me some time to be alone.	Ka ba ni ɗan lokaci don zama da kaina.
It’s easy, when you eat, just eat.	Yana da sauƙi, lokacin da kuke cin abinci, kawai ku ci.
It did not happen overnight, and it is not easy.	Hakan bai faru a rana ɗaya ba kuma ba ta da sauƙi.
We should continue to do so.	Ya kamata mu ci gaba da hakan.
I did well in the heat in the back.	Na yi kyau a cikin zafi a baya.
If you have something to do, do it.	Idan kuna da abin da za ku yi, yi shi.
If anything, run faster.	Idan wani abu, ya kara gudu.
We are going to have dinner.	Za mu ci abincin dare.
Accept everything.	Yarda da komai.
He came back a second.	Ya dawo na biyu.
That's good.	Hakan yayi kyau.
He can tell.	Zai iya fada.
I'm honest, they do.	Ina da gaskiya, suna yi.
I don't know how that will be.	Ban san yadda hakan zai kasance ba.
And yet one must be able to work.	Kuma duk da haka dole ne mutum ya iya yin aiki.
I have to come back to see you.	Dole ne in dawo don ganin ku.
I enjoyed the work.	Na ji daɗin aikin.
This is the knowledge of the mind.	Wannan sanin tunani ne.
They went home.	Suka wuce gida.
Look in.	Duba ciki.
What to see.	Abin da ake gani.
These thoughts are not helpful or desired.	Waɗannan tunanin ba su taimaka ko ake so ba.
It can be seen that this is true as follows.	Ana iya ganin cewa wannan gaskiya ne kamar haka.
It just has to be what you fill it with.	Sai kawai ya zama abin da kuka cika shi da shi.
Which no doubt was.	Wanda babu shakka ya kasance.
They did well then.	Sun yi kyau a lokacin kuma.
I got kind of close.	Na samu irin kusa.
He slowly opened the door.	Ya bude kofar a hankali.
But we must be honest.	Amma ya kamata mu kasance masu gaskiya.
Go from there.	Ku tafi daga can.
What’s so amazing about that ???.	Menene ban mamaki game da hakan???.
One day it rained a lot.	Wata rana aka yi ruwa mai yawa.
We do not know what to do.	Ba mu san abin da za mu yi ba.
However, the error got in the way.	Duk da haka, kuskure ya shiga cikin hanya.
We are very much on board.	Muna cikin jirgin sosai.
Of course it is.	Tabbas yana da.
But just not there anymore.	Amma kawai ba a can kuma.
I hate feeling that way.	Na ƙi jin wannan hanyar.
This is also a new development.	Wannan ma wani sabon ci gaba ne.
I honestly do not know.	Ni gaskiya ban sani ba.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Kamar ana neman fada ne.
Someone will answer.	Wani zai amsa.
But it is not over.	Amma bata gama ba.
Give it to me.	Ya ba ni.
How amazing, you can say.	Yaya ban mamaki, za ku iya cewa.
Not so much.	Ba haka da yawa ba.
He used to have problems at school.	Ya kasance yana yawan samun matsala a makaranta.
No one would have thought that she would do that.	Ba wanda zai yi tunanin cewa za ta yi hakan.
Somehow, somehow, he would do it himself.	Ko ta yaya, wata hanya, zai yi da kansa.
I can not add.	Ba zan iya ƙara ba.
One of a kind.	Daya daga cikin irin.
Maybe she wants to go outside.	Watakila tana so ta fita waje.
Which is also a very, very good thing.	Wanda kuma abu ne mai matukar kyau da kyau.
I can't think of how we did it.	Ba zan iya tunanin yadda muka yi ba.
He suffered for a month.	Ya sha wahala tsawon wata guda.
They were almost slow.	Sun kasance kusan a hankali.
She passed that time, on him.	Ta wuce wannan lokacin, a kan shi.
None of these really are.	Babu ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan da gaske.
She responded quickly.	Ta amsa da sauri.
I heard it, everyone heard.	Na ji shi, kowa ya ji.
That's what we did.	Haka aka yi mu.
There is no way around that.	Babu wata hanya a kusa da hakan.
That is what they need.	Abin da suke bukata ke nan.
The truth is good when you get involved.	Gaskiya yana da kyau idan kun shiga.
Exactly like each other.	Daidai kamar juna.
They never got involved.	Ba su taɓa shiga ciki ba.
It wastes a lot of time.	Tana bata lokaci mai yawa.
So you love music.	Don haka kuna son waƙa.
However, these will still prevail.	Duk da haka, waɗannan har yanzu za su yi nasara.
And they did just that.	Kuma sun yi haka kawai.
Do not get involved.	Kada kuma a shiga hannu.
Do you understand what you are doing?	Kun gane abin da kuke yi?
Everyone started talking.	Kowa ya fara magana.
I don't like the man.	Ba na son mutumin.
I have not yet returned home.	Har yanzu ban koma gida ba.
It is time to move on.	Lokaci ya yi da zai ci gaba.
Hear things you have never heard before.	Ji abubuwan da ba ku taɓa ji ba.
Together they grew up.	Tare suka girma.
But it will not come.	Amma ba zai zo ba.
I told you not to worry.	Na gaya muku kada ku damu.
We sold our car yesterday.	Mun sayar da motar mu jiya.
No one wanted it.	Babu wanda ya so shi.
Just time.	Lokaci kawai.
You're done.	Kun gama.
She could not bear it.	Ta kasa hakuri.
It is difficult to explain why someone did not do something.	Yana da wuya a bayyana dalilin da ya sa wani bai yi wani abu ba.
For further consideration, please write it down.	Don tunani na gaba, da fatan za a rubuta shi.
Everything is wrong, I am.	Duk abin da ba daidai ba, ni ne.
She knows that life begins in the womb.	Ta san cewa rayuwa ta fara ne a cikin ciki.
He got it right.	Ya samu daidai.
I think it's right.	Ina tsammanin daidai yake.
This is pretty simple, but it’s not.	Wannan yana da sauƙi mai sauƙi, amma ba haka ba.
I really care about seeing you.	A gaskiya na damu da ganin ku.
They must be properly cared for.	Dole ne a kula da su yadda ya kamata.
Want the next one.	So na gaba.
People understand this very well.	Mutane sun fahimci wannan sosai.
We were there.	Mun kasance a can.
I'll find out.	Zan gano.
It seems.	Kamar alama.
Almost three months.	Kusan wata uku.
Getting pregnant is not easy.	Ba abu mai sauƙi ba ne yin ciki.
Maybe we should go swimming.	Wataƙila ya kamata mu je yin iyo.
That's what you need.	Abin da kuke bukata ke nan.
I think you probably know.	Ina tsammanin tabbas kun sani.
People are laughing and talking to each other.	Mutane suna dariya suna magana da juna.
So everything changed for her.	Don haka duk abin ya canza mata.
Let's look at this.	Mu kalli wannan.
I arrived home.	Na isa gida.
I type mine a lot as well.	Ina buga nawa da yawa haka kuma.
He can, however, make people feel as he pleases.	Zai iya, duk da haka, ya sa mutane su ji kamar yadda yake so.
The food cooled slowly.	Abincin ya yi sanyi a hankali.
Of course there is something in it.	Tabbas sai da akwai wani abu a ciki.
Put it on.	Saka shi.
I don't need that now.	Bana bukatar hakan yanzu.
Cold weather will kill you.	Yin sanyi zai kashe ku.
He was by the way.	Ya kasance ta hanyar.
No name of course.	Babu suna ba shakka.
They can come very quickly.	Suna iya zuwa da sauri da sauri.
We both will.	Mu biyu za mu yi.
I can't speak now.	Ba zan iya magana yanzu.
Anything wrong, we will talk about it.	Duk abin da ba daidai ba, za mu yi magana game da shi.
That makes you happy.	Hakan ya sa ka ji daɗi.
No, the day before yesterday.	A'a, kwana daya kafin jiya.
I can get it.	Zan iya samun shi.
Not even from you.	Ba ma daga gare ku ba.
I wondered how everyone would react.	Na yi mamakin yadda kowa zai amsa.
It has been changed.	An canza masa.
If only you could think.	Idan za ku iya tunani kawai.
Do not be surprised by this statement.	Kada a yi mamaki game da wannan magana.
What an amazing size.	Wane irin girma ne mai ban mamaki.
That made you think.	Hakan ya sa ka yi tunani.
Let's not talk about it again.	Kada mu sake yin magana game da shi.
The hot water made her cry.	Ruwan zafi ya sanya mata kuka.
I do not have time to do such things.	Ba ni da lokacin yin irin waɗannan abubuwan.
Leave it and forget it.	Ku bar shi ku manta da shi.
Life was as usual.	Rayuwa ta kasance kamar yadda aka saba.
Anything can happen.	Komai na iya faruwa.
No one thought so though.	Babu wanda ya yi tunani haka ko da yake.
Pretty boy.	Kyakkyawan yaro.
I seem to be getting into a mistake.	Ina da alama ina shiga cikin wani kuskure.
What we are saying now cannot bring them back to life.	Abin da muke faɗa yanzu ba zai iya dawo da su zuwa rai ba.
It's time.	Ya isa akan lokaci.
I'm sure of it.	Na tabbata da shi.
I don't want anything.	Ba na son komai.
She knows how to play the waiting game.	Ta san yadda ake buga wasan jira.
No he can not give you an answer.	A'a ba zai iya ba ku amsa ba.
Before speaking, start thinking.	Kafin magana, fara tunani.
He could not be sure.	Ya kasa tabbata.
The number will be equal.	Yawan zai zama daidai.
I'm very scared.	Ina jin tsoro sosai.
That's why working for others makes people work.	Shi ya sa yin aiki ga wasu yana sa mutane su yi aiki.
Her way forward was in pain and fear.	Hanyar da ta kasance ta gaba da gaba cikin zafi da tsoro.
I can see the water.	Ina iya ganin ruwan.
If it works for you it works for.	Idan yana aiki a gare ku yana aiki don.
I have been flying for a long time.	Na dade da tashi.
She is everything to him.	Ita ce masa komai.
We got it.	Mun samu.
I want to say.	Ana so in ce.
He tried to get it.	Ya gwada ya samu.
Maybe it's the last time.	Wataƙila shi ne karo na ƙarshe.
I also want a big belly.	Ina kuma son babban ciki.
It's an amazing thing.	Abu ne mai ban mamaki.
Maybe for money.	Wataƙila don kuɗi.
Gradually they opened the door.	A hankali suka bude kofar.
A burning sensation from him to me.	Wani zafi mai zafi daga gare shi zuwa gare ni.
If she wants to.	Idan tana so.
No more talking.	Babu magana kuma.
'and'.	'na'.
Not necessarily simple but useful.	Ba lallai ba ne mai sauƙi amma mai amfani.
However not lost.	Duk da haka ba a rasa ba.
We did really well with them.	Mun yi kyau sosai da su.
But then slowly.	Amma sai a hankali.
So they were.	Haka suka kasance.
Our product will last.	Kayan mu zai kare.
God knows he has to pay.	Allah ya sani ya biya.
Still amazing really amazing keep up the good work.	Har yanzu ban mamaki gaske ban mamaki ci gaba da ci gaba da aikin ku.
I think she will make a beautiful home.	Ina tsammanin za ta yi kyakkyawan gida.
I want her to be happy.	Ina son ta yi farin ciki.
This is something we should do.	Wannan abu ne da ya kamata mu yi.
He can touch it if he wants to.	Zai iya taba shi idan ya so.
No one, of course, can explain even one of them.	Babu wanda, ba shakka, zai iya bayyana ko ɗaya daga ciki.
It's easy.	Yana da sauƙi.
Maybe he stopped thinking at the time.	Watakila ya daina tunanin a lokacin.
It continues.	Yana ci gaba.
It does not seem to work.	Da alama baya aiki.
In fact, everything is.	A gaskiya, duk abin da yake.
But you are mine now.	Amma kai nawa ne yanzu.
You will soon know what kind of person he is.	Nan da nan za ku san irin mutumin.
Probably a few will.	Wataƙila kaɗan ne za su yi.
However, this is completely false.	Duk da haka, wannan gaba daya karya ne.
I just have to make sure.	Dole ne kawai in tabbatar.
He wondered what the man was thinking.	Yayi mamakin me mutumin yake tunani.
Immediately, he pointed out.	Nan da nan, ya nuna.
As he expected.	Kamar yadda ya zata.
I still do.	Har yanzu na yi.
You have to be very careful when driving at night.	Dole ne ku yi hankali sosai lokacin tuƙi da dare.
She must have done them.	Lallai ta yi su.
I like it completely.	Ina son shi gaba daya.
Enough about me.	Ya isa game da ni.
She called several times.	Ta kira sau da yawa.
So he stayed there.	Don haka can ya zauna.
There is no right way.	Babu hanyar da ta dace.
In case you didn’t know, you probably slept in the crowd.	Idan ba ku sani ba, tabbas kun yi barci a cikin taron.
The meeting was a waste of time.	Taron ya kasance bata lokaci ne.
He is not just joking.	Ba wasa kawai yake yi ba.
I know they will enjoy this.	Na san za su ji daɗin wannan.
The man is fine.	Mutumin yana lafiya.
She is very happy.	Ta yi farin ciki sosai.
She has one too.	Ta na da daya da yawa.
Others went in at night.	Wasu kuma suka shiga cikin dare.
She will be very successful.	Za ta yi nasara sosai.
Only children.	Yara ne kawai.
It should still be there, don't worry.	Yakamata har yanzu yana nan, kar ku damu.
It doesn’t say anything about the two of you.	Ba ya cewa komai game da ku biyu.
But it happens.	Amma yana faruwa.
I've been fighting.	Na sha fada.
She cries a lot.	Kuka take sosai.
You may be wondering why.	Wataƙila ka yi mamakin dalilin da ya sa.
It is a very interesting place.	Wuri ne mai ban sha'awa sosai.
And yet people are coming there.	Kuma duk da haka mutane suna zuwa wurin.
She let me in.	Ita ce ta bari na shiga.
No one ever laughed.	Babu wanda ya taba yin dariya.
Of course, she would have preferred this.	Tabbas, da ta fi son wannan.
He ate the second meal slowly.	Ya ci abinci na biyu a hankali.
There is something amazing about it.	Akwai wani abin ban mamaki game da shi.
Or stay there and die.	Ko ku zauna a can ku mutu.
I decided that.	Na yanke shawarar haka.
So he had to die.	Don haka dole ne ya mutu.
Almost two days if you find a way.	Kusan kwana biyu idan kun sami hanyar.
It is restarted and all is working.	An sake kunna shi kuma duk yana aiki.
For me, this is the time.	A gare ni, wannan shine lokacin.
Can you tell me about this place.	Za ku iya gaya mani game da wannan wurin.
Both are recorded and heard.	An rubuta duka da ji.
And around everyone.	Kuma a kusa da kowa.
Be careful what you like!	Yi hankali da abin da kuke so!
Exit! 	Fita!
In fact, it didn’t come close.	A gaskiya ma, ba ta zo kusa ba.
They have been here for three years.	Sun yi shekara uku a nan.
He wanted to protect her.	Ya so ya kare ta.
Let's go now.	Mu tafi yanzu.
Or maybe you will.	Ko watakila za ku yi.
It can be done.	Ana iya yi.
So we make sure it is applied to everything.	Don haka muna tabbatar da cewa an yi amfani da shi akan komai.
All by one user.	Duk ta mai amfani ɗaya.
Go with him.	Ku tafi tare da shi.
Can't help now.	Ba za a iya taimaka yanzu.
You can pay for it later.	Kuna iya biya shi daga baya.
I think she will get into it anytime soon.	Ina tsammanin za ta shiga cikin kowane lokaci.
That makes it mine.	Hakan yasa ya zama nawa.
None of us.	Babu daya daga cikin mu.
It worked really well.	Yayi aiki sosai.
But you have little time to do many things.	Amma kuna da ɗan lokaci kaɗan don yin abubuwa da yawa.
And not just one, she was the first.	Kuma ba ɗaya kaɗai ba, ta kasance ta farko.
So there is such a thing.	Don haka akwai irin wannan.
The rain stopped overnight.	Ruwan sama ya tsaya a cikin dare.
I'll fix them, he thought.	Zan gyara su, ya yi tunani.
That made me feel good.	Hakan ya sa na ji dadi.
I did not call again.	Ban sake kira ba.
Of course she does.	Tabbas tana yi.
There is something going on.	Akwai wani abu da ke faruwa.
Don't be late.	Kar a makara.
I don't know how long she stayed.	Bata san tsawon lokacin da ta tsaya ba.
It's really funny.	A gaskiya abin ban dariya ne.
There must be a better way to do this though.	Dole ne a sami mafi kyawun hanyar yin wannan ko da yake.
This will get me.	Wannan zai sama min.
When he left home.	Da ya bar gida.
Somewhere, some time from there.	Wani wuri, wani lokaci daga can.
The police were called.	An kira 'yan sanda.
Even that would be very difficult.	Ko da hakan zai yi wahala sosai.
No one bought it for me.	Babu wanda ya saya min shi.
Simply, something about it.	Kawai, wani abu game da shi.
He could see.	Ya iya gani.
This allowed her to do housework.	Hakan ya ba ta damar yin aikin gida.
She heard the door slammed shut.	Ta ji an rufe kofar gida.
We all laughed when we saw.	Mu duka muka yi dariya lokacin da muka gani.
He doesn't seem to care, though.	Da alama bai damu da hakan ba, duk da haka.
I turn it on.	Ina kunna shi.
I opened them, of course.	Na bude su, tabbas.
I didn't eat today.	Ban ci abinci yau ba.
No one else here.	Babu wani kuma a nan.
I am not alive before you.	Ba ni da rai kafin ku.
Keep up the good work.	Ku ci gaba da aikin.
He did not, though early.	Bai yi ba, duk da da wuri.
Sorry to hear that.	Yi hakuri da jin haka.
I know that for sure.	Na san hakan a gaskiya.
But this is a lie.	Amma wannan karya ce.
But he did.	Amma ya yi.
It will not work even if we try.	Ba zai yi aiki ba ko da mun gwada.
Is there any help? 	Akwai taimako?
They may tell him that they are in pain.	Suna iya gaya masa cewa suna jin zafi.
Money, just looking for ideas from myself.	Kudi, kawai neman tunani daga kaina.
He just didn’t do it for me.	Kawai bai yi min ba.
And everyone wants a good chance.	Kuma kowa yana son samun dama mai kyau.
Tell me if this does not look normal.	Faɗa mani idan wannan bai yi kama da saba ba.
He wanted to cry.	Ya so yayi kuka.
It took from a while later.	Ya dauka daga wani lokaci ne daga baya.
He didn't really care.	Bai kula sosai ba.
This is where he should tell her.	A nan ne ya kamata ya gaya mata.
Although finding the place will not be easy.	Ko da yake samun wurin ba zai yi sauƙi ba.
I want to go early.	Ina so in tafi da wuri.
Traveling in everything with us, he took a lot of time showing us around.	Tafiya cikin komai tare da mu, ya ɗauki lokaci mai yawa yana nuna mana a kusa.
I do not have to tell you what to fear.	Ba sai na gaya muku abin da ya kamata ku ji tsoro ba.
Maybe somehow it closed.	Wataƙila ko ta yaya ya rufe.
I'm really here.	Ina nan da gaske.
He did.	Haka ya yi.
Maybe he didn't.	Wataƙila bai yi ba.
I remember that everything was amazing.	Na tuna cewa duk abin ya kasance ban mamaki.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
And now, let them try.	Kuma yanzu, bari su gwada.
It's so simple.	Yana da sauƙi haka.
Suddenly this hurt me even more.	Nan da nan wannan ya kara mani rauni.
However, only two have ever been done.	Duk da haka, biyu ne kawai aka taba yi.
I think you suffered a lot.	Ina tsammanin kun sha wahala sosai.
We would have seen more.	Da ma mun kara gani.
First, take a cup of coffee.	Da farko, ɗauki kofi na kofi.
It's a pleasure.	Abin farin ciki ne.
I left her way.	Na bar mata hanya.
I did it.	Na yi da shi.
I could not understand why.	Na kasa gane dalilin da ya sa.
Can't help.	Ba za a iya taimaka ba.
One month ago, best yet.	Wata daya da ya wuce, mafi kyau tukuna.
Another kind.	Wani irin .
He plays with it.	Yana wasa da ita.
Everything is the same.	Komai daya ne.
But there is no need for you to act on it.	Amma babu bukatar ku yi aiki da shi.
It's not time.	Ba lokaci ba ne.
The newcomers are not familiar.	Ba a saba da masu zuwa ba.
Many people like him.	Mutane da yawa kamar shi.
This is what he is fighting for.	Wannan shi ne yake fada da baya.
He has been here for a while.	Ya kasance a nan da ɗan lokaci.
This can be done at any time of the year.	Ana iya yin wannan a kowane lokaci a cikin shekara.
I should have, and I am sad.	Ya kamata in kasance, kuma ina bakin ciki.
I've been hot for over two years.	Na yi zafi sama da shekaru biyu.
There is something about her.	Akwai wani abu game da ita.
Last time for you.	Lokaci na ƙarshe a gare ku.
Uncertainty over this future.	Rashin tabbas akan wannan gaba.
I think you can still.	Ina tsammanin za ku iya har yanzu.
We have to go home.	Dole mu koma gida.
I do not know if this is correct.	Ban sani ba ko wannan daidai ne.
Although it is not.	Ko da yake ba haka ba ne.
Someone else covered it.	Wani ma ya rufe shi.
Like it had a place.	Kamar yana da wani wuri.
Maybe that will change.	Wataƙila hakan zai canza.
You must try it.	Dole ne ku gwada shi.
He expected me to imitate him.	Ya sa rai in yi koyi da shi.
If he runs.	Idan ya gudu .
I give you a good idea to think about.	Ina ba ku wani kyakkyawan tunani don tunani.
We really enjoyed reading this book.	Mun ji daɗin karanta wannan littafin sosai.
People do that.	Mutane suna yin haka.
Simply, there it is.	Kawai, akwai shi.
When will this life return?	Yaushe wannan rayuwa zata koma?
We have so many different things.	Muna da abubuwa da yawa da yawa.
In fact he was released.	A gaskiya an sake shi.
It seems the game was played there.	Da alama an buga wasan a can.
They do not play with truth and honesty.	Ba sa wasa da gaskiya da gaskiya.
They surprised each other.	Suka ba juna mamaki.
Maybe years ago.	Wataƙila shekaru da suka wuce.
I could be wrong about that.	Zan iya yin kuskure game da wannan.
He could not think of anything to say.	Ya kasa tunanin me zai ce.
Let's live together.	Mu zauna tare.
But they made it work.	Amma sun sanya shi aiki.
This is the best time of the day.	Wannan shine lokaci mafi kyau na kowace rana.
He would not tell me.	Ba zai gaya mani ba.
I can't think of a single word.	Ba zan iya tunanin ko daya magana ba.
Fearful, stand alone.	Mai tsoro, tsaya ji kadai.
It's interesting.	Yana da ban sha'awa.
Everyone ate well.	Kowa ya ci abinci sosai.
I continued to study.	Na ci gaba da karatu.
They were removed to an undisclosed location.	An cire su zuwa wani wuri da ba a bayyana ba.
Another thing.	Wani abu kuma.
There is nothing in it, nothing.	Babu komai a ciki, ba komai.
Sell ​​it to someone else.	Ka sayar wa wani.
All of this works perfectly.	Duk wannan yana aiki daidai.
You must know how to get there.	Dole ne ku san yadda za ku isa wurin.
Hand, he thought.	Hannu, ya yi tunani.
Hope you are well.	Da fatan kuna lafiya.
But that is difficult.	Amma hakan ya yi wuya.
This would have been done.	Da an yi wannan.
It's better.	Ya fi kyau.
Come here first.	Ku zo nan tukuna.
Many people agree.	Mutane da yawa sun yarda da hakan.
And we will succeed.	Kuma za mu yi nasara.
Who in the world could do such a thing?	Wanene a duniya zai yi irin wannan abu?
We are very happy about that.	Mun ji dadi sosai game da hakan.
Even greater, may be desired.	Ko mafi girma, ana iya so.
I always say.	A koyaushe ina cewa.
It's just so much more.	Kawai ya fi haka yawa.
It's hard, hard, hard.	Yana da wuya, wuya, wuya.
I was a little surprised.	Na dan yi mamaki.
Like nothing you can imagine.	Kamar babu abin da za ku iya tunanin.
We know he made a mistake.	Mun san ya yi kuskure.
I love it but I do not know what to do.	Ina son shi amma ban san abin da zan yi ba.
He cannot walk without the use of a stick.	Ba zai iya tafiya ba tare da amfani da sanda ba.
It gives you comfort on the one hand.	Yana ba ku jin daɗi a hannu ɗaya.
It must be stopped.	Dole ne a daina.
Some people can't.	Wasu mutane ba za su iya ba.
Maybe we won’t have a problem with that statement.	Wataƙila ba za mu sami matsala da wannan magana ba.
But do not ask her about it.	Amma kar ka tambaye ta game da hakan.
However, he kind of liked it.	Duk da haka, ya irin son shi.
She's gone for a long time.	Ta dade da tafi.
There is so much to do,	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a yi,
Maybe we all went through it several times.	Wataƙila duk mun wuce ta sau da yawa.
It did not appear.	Bai bayyana ba.
Even if he didn’t, she didn’t care.	Ko da bai yi ba, ba ta damu ba.
Well, let’s get started right away.	Da kyau, bari mu fara nan da nan.
I want to see something, everything, happen.	Ina so in ga wani abu, komai, ya faru.
By hand.	Da hannu.
I'm glad, there are kids my age.	Na ji daɗi, akwai yara masu shekaru na.
It's not good.	Bai yi kyau ba.
So it is not enough to know.	Don haka bai isa ya sani ba.
You are not alone.	Ba kai kaɗai ba.
Say you like these two things.	Ka ce kana son waɗannan abubuwa biyu.
You will hear me.	Za a ji da ni.
That's good.	Abin da ke da kyau haka.
I know we have no chance.	Na san cewa ba mu da dama.
They sell food here.	Suna sayar da abinci a nan.
She looks like she is now.	Ta yi kama kamar ta yanzu.
He will not care about the grandeur or use of the world.	Ba zai kula da girma mai girma ko amfani da duniya ba.
He knew, of course, that the others were now dead.	Ya sani, ba shakka, cewa sauran sun mutu a yanzu.
You just know her.	Kai kawai ka san ta.
But it did not go well.	Amma bai yi kyau ba.
He will not stay safe there.	Ba zai zauna lafiya a can ba.
He did not know what to say.	Bai san me zai ce ba.
She is OK.	Tana lafiya.
Since the meeting, he has a big head.	Tun daga taron, yana da babban kai.
Expect to talk.	Yi tsammanin magana.
I can keep going but just check it out for yourself.	Zan iya ci gaba da ci gaba amma kawai duba shi da kanku.
She does not want to.	Ba ta so.
He tried to think carefully.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya yi tunani a hankali.
I see they like drinking this.	Na ga suna son shan wannan.
You have to get up.	Dole ku tashi.
It makes me forget.	Ya sa na manta.
They go home and sleep.	Suka koma gida suka yi barci.
Just wait to accept it.	Jira kawai in yarda da shi.
And what is all they do.	Kuma menene duk abin da suka yi.
That is not the real problem.	Wannan ba shine ainihin matsalar ba.
It does not work.	Ba shi da aiki.
It does not add up.	Ba ya kara zuwa.
You do not want to.	Ba ku so.
And it may be right.	Kuma yana iya zama daidai.
It is you.	Yana da ku.
It feels like it happened to someone else.	Ji yake kamar ya faru da wani.
Not necessarily.	Ba dole bane.
It would be nice to have a dog.	Zai yi kyau a sami kare.
They are on the road.	Suna kan hanya.
They live here.	Suna zaune a nan.
I arrived early, but not enough.	Na isa da wuri, amma ban isa ba.
And we sell where we can.	Kuma muna sayar da inda za mu iya.
And she doesn't really want to be him.	Kuma ba ta son zama shi sosai.
Tell me.	Fada mata me.
Only I can.	Ni kadai zan iya.
I have to hurry.	Dole na yi sauri.
Not on board.	Ba a kan jirgin ba.
He entered.	Ya shiga.
No time was lost.	Ba a rasa wani lokaci ba.
The meeting will be at three o'clock.	Taron zai kasance da karfe uku.
Let's prove this to.	Bari mu tabbatar da wannan don .
They are still simple.	Har yanzu suna da sauƙi.
You are amazing.	Kun kasance ban mamaki.
I passed.	Na wuce.
But she can't think of that now.	Amma ta kasa tunanin hakan yanzu.
So it is.	Don haka shi ne.
However, there are opportunities.	Duk da haka, akwai dama.
It's over.	Ya wuce.
If this does not work, the school will be used.	Idan wannan bai yi aiki ba, za a yi amfani da makaranta.
It's just another world.	Wata duniya ce kawai.
I tried to figure out what to say.	Na yi ƙoƙari na san abin da zan faɗa.
Don't think, just do it !.	Kar ka yi tunani, kawai yi!.
I know he is here, and so are others.	Na san yana nan, da sauran su ma.
Or get up or something.	Ko tashi ko wani abu.
You will die.	Za ku mutu.
I came here more busy.	Ni zo nan fi aiki.
As for everyone.	Amma ga kowa da kowa.
I will still myself.	Zan kaina har yanzu.
Often.	Sau da yawa.
All but three.	Duk sai uku.
She trusted me on everything.	Ta yarda da ni a kan komai.
You have the opportunity.	Kun sami damar.
They don't feel anything.	Ba sa jin komai.
Let me take you home.	Bari in kai ku gida.
He knew he shouldn't.	Ya san bai kamata ba.
I will definitely be back in the near future.	Tabbas zan dawo nan gaba kadan.
This and that there is someone with me.	Wannan da cewa akwai wani tare da ni.
She lost everything.	Ta rasa komai.
You arrested me.	Kun kama ni.
I don't see where you did this.	Ban ga inda kuka yi wannan ba.
It's easy to get hurt.	Yana da sauƙi a ji rauni.
I grew up very well.	Na girma sosai.
She never did that.	Ba ta taba yin haka ba.
We all did.	Mu duka mun yi.
We will not worry about the place.	Ba za mu damu da wurin ba.
The car passed the school.	Motar ta wuce makaranta.
I did not go out looking for you.	Ban fita neman ku ba.
He said yes.	Yace yayi.
He is married and has children.	Ya yi aure kuma yana da yara.
Everyone appears to know everything about everyone.	Kowa ya bayyana ya san komai game da kowa.
I was positive about it.	Na kasance mai kyau game da shi.
What does a person do for a living?	Menene mutumin yake yi don rayuwa?
You are beautiful.	Kuna da kyau.
But it will be better in the end.	Amma zai yi kyau a ƙarshe.
Women are not doing anything right.	Mata ba sa yin wani abu daidai.
The bus stopped, and you were left alone.	Motar bas ta tsaya, kuma an bar ku.
The sun rose slowly.	Rana ta tashi a hankali.
I totally agree with you.	Na yarda da ku gaba daya.
Well wait.	Da kyau jira.
It should work fine now.	Yakamata yayi aiki da kyau yanzu.
It was quick and easy.	Ya kasance da sauri da sauƙi.
She spoke so loudly.	Ta fad'a sosai.
How did that happen? 	Ta yaya hakan ya faru?
He sold slowly.	Ya sayar a hankali.
I do this for a living.	Ina yin haka don rayuwa.
The work is not as easy as it seems.	Aikin ba shi da sauƙi kamar yadda yake gani.
Anyone can do that.	Kowa na iya yin hakan.
He is a human being.	Shi mutum ne.
They just went out.	Sun d'an fita.
Many people stood up for us.	Mutane da yawa sun tsaya mana.
I can't understand this.	Ba zan iya gane wannan ba.
Some, like me, never gave up.	Wasu, kamar ni, ba su daina ba.
But we already know these things.	Amma mun riga mun san waɗannan abubuwa.
They do and they don't think so.	Suna yi kuma ba sa tunanin hakan.
The son of a rich man?	Dan mai kudi?
I had no idea at the time.	Ba ni da tunani a wannan lokacin.
This provides more fun and excitement.	Wannan yana ba da ƙarin jin daɗi da jin daɗi.
She must have been very weak.	Dole ne ta kasance mai rauni sosai.
Everything is fine from start to finish.	Komai yayi kyau tun daga farko har ƙarshe.
They will be very happy after a while.	Za su yi farin ciki sosai bayan ɗan lokaci.
He does not want to be found out.	Ba ya so a gano shi.
He knew he should stop.	Ya san ya kamata ya daina.
And life is.	Kuma rayuwa shine.
Fine for the moment.	Lafiya don lokacin.
Please don't go, please stop.	Don Allah kar ku tafi, don Allah ku tsaya.
I have to do it.	Dole ne a yi ni.
But only then.	Amma sai kawai.
He never did and will never do.	Bai taba yi ba kuma ba zai taba yi ba.
Never before have so many been seen.	Ba a taɓa ganin da yawa haka ba.
It's in enough now.	Yana cikin isa yanzu.
But no one can.	Amma babu wanda zai iya.
They stand outside.	Suka tsaya a waje.
Who is he?	Wanene shi.
Some.	Wani.
I can give you a job.	Zan iya ba ku aiki.
That was right after you stopped.	Hakan ya kasance daidai bayan kun tsaya.
Send all.	Aika duka.
I do not know where we are.	Ban san inda muke ba.
But even this may work for you.	Amma ko da wannan na iya yin aiki a gare ku.
Maybe we should eat one day.	Wataƙila ya kamata mu ci abinci wata rana.
She didn't think about it, and she was hurt.	Bata yi tunani ba, kuma ta ji rauni.
Let me know what you like best.	Bari in san abin da kuka fi so.
She employed the girls.	Ta ba wa 'yan mata aikin yi.
But she thought he could or would give her another chance.	Amma ta yi tunanin zai iya ko ya sake ba ta wata dama.
It really makes you start thinking.	Da gaske yana sa ka fara tunani.
What he does is make you feel good.	Abin da yake yi shi ne ya sa ku ji daɗi.
I should have known better.	Ya kamata in sani da kyau.
I take it as it says.	Ina ɗauka kamar yadda yake cewa.
Maybe he heard it.	Wataƙila ya ji ta.
And they just do it.	Kuma suna yin haka kawai.
The harder you try, the harder they get.	Da wahala ka gwada, da wuya su samu.
He is worried.	Ya damu.
We were.	Mun kasance .
Or tell it.	Ko fada da shi.
After that, we agreed.	Bayan haka, mun yarda.
There is nothing in it.	Babu komai a ciki.
Sometimes it’s good to just keep going.	Wani lokaci yana da kyau a ci gaba kawai.
The day was hot and humid.	Ranar tana da zafi da zafi.
But there are many more to do.	Amma da sauran abubuwa da yawa a yi.
I have nothing.	Ba ni da wani abu.
You need to know when to do it.	Kuna buƙatar sanin lokacin da ya dace don yin shi.
Write something on it.	Rubuta wani abu a kai.
See what they have.	Duba abin da suke da shi.
And every time they hit it, they hear me.	Kuma duk lokacin da suka buga shi, suna ji na.
She needs all the help she can get.	Tana bukatar duk taimakon da za ta iya samu.
Maybe that works for you, and it would be amazing if it did.	Wataƙila hakan yana aiki a gare ku, kuma hakan yana da ban mamaki idan ya yi.
But you will love it anyway.	Amma za ku so shi ta wata hanya.
I was as happy as it could be.	Na yi farin ciki kamar yadda zai iya zama.
There is nothing in the car.	Babu komai a cikin motar.
I can see what was done and what was not done.	Ina iya ganin abin da aka yi da abin da ba a yi ba.
She came to the end of the road.	Ta zo karshen hanya.
Life here is exciting.	Rayuwa a nan yana da ban sha'awa.
Today she feels she can see the future.	Yau ta ji zata iya ganin gaba.
I feel you man.	Ina jin kai mutum.
You can see and hear everything here, too.	Kuna iya gani da jin komai a nan, kuma.
Otherwise, it would not be.	In ba haka ba, da ba zai kasance ba.
And they do not want to.	Kuma ba so.
I must go	Ina so in tafi
That's how it all started.	Haka aka fara komai.
Mind did nothing to me.	Hankali bai yi min komai ba.
There is a lot of work to be done.	Akwai babban aiki da za a yi.
She is so beautiful.	Ta yi kyau sosai.
Now you have a little sleep, because we have a difficult journey.	Yanzu ka ɗan yi barci, don muna da tafiya mai wuya.
But together, we have opportunities.	Amma tare, muna da dama.
I have done it twice before.	Na yi shi sau biyu a baya.
The others died inside.	Sauran sun mutu a ciki.
I want her out on my own.	Ina so ta fita daga kaina.
That is why they need us.	Shi ya sa suke bukatar mu.
There are so many.	Akwai su da yawa.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Wataƙila shi ne ya sa shi ya tashi.
Sad to see this go.	Bakin ciki ganin wannan tafi.
Of course not.	Tabbas ba ku.
She is alone.	Ita kadai ce.
But it certainly is.	Amma tabbas ita ce.
They want to be in control of the game.	Suna son su kasance masu kula da wasan.
But this benefit is rarely found in speech.	Amma ba a cika samun wannan amfani a cikin magana ba.
I'll try to have fun.	Zan gwada jin daɗi.
But something happened.	Amma wani abu ya faru.
He must know.	Dole ne ya sani.
I hope you enjoy it.	Ina fatan za ku ji daɗin hakan.
Use any means to reach the end.	Yi amfani da kowace hanya don zuwa ƙarshe.
You are from today.	Kai ke nan daga yau.
You are also smart.	Kai ma kana da hankali.
But often it is the only way.	Amma sau da yawa ita ce kawai hanya.
There is something else.	Akwai kuma wani abu kuma.
We will focus on that.	Za mu mai da hankali kan hakan.
He did not eat at home.	Bai ci abinci a gida ba.
I look forward to working with him again, too.	Ina fatan sake yin aiki tare da shi, kuma.
He loved the house.	Ya so gidan.
They seem to be right.	Da alama sun yi daidai.
Not at the time, he thought.	Ba a lokacin ba, ya yi tunani.
One day he brought them back home.	Daya bayan ya dawo da su gida.
The knowledge is not beyond that.	Sanin bai wuce haka ba.
They like things.	Suna son abubuwa.
They don't care about us.	Ba su damu da mu ba.
If anyone could offer any help it would be amazing.	Idan wani zai iya ba da kowane taimako zai zama abin ban mamaki.
This is not a game, however, "no game".	Wannan ba wasa ba ne, duk da haka, "babu wasa".
Nothing is fast enough.	Babu wani abu da ya isa sauri.
You can check this out.	Kuna iya duba wannan.
But he sees it only for me.	Amma yana ganin shi kaɗai a gare ni.
Suddenly he came to her.	Nan da nan ya zo mata.
We do not know what he did, or what he did not do.	Ba mu san abin da ya yi ba, ko abin da bai yi ba.
Everyone is laughing.	Kowa sai dariya yake yi.
It shouldn't have been, but it did.	Bai kamata ya kasance ba, amma ya yi.
And there is no reason for her to think that everyone will do it now.	Kuma babu dalilin da zai sa ta yi tunanin kowa zai yi yanzu.
He died on the floor.	Ya mutu a kasa.
I feel that way.	Ina jin haka.
We got nothing.	Ba mu sami komai ba.
But he could not pull it off alone.	Amma ba zai iya cire shi kadai ba.
Just get one.	Kawai samun daya.
Not found.	Ba a samu ba.
We do not know where we are going.	Ba mu san inda za mu je ba.
It's a way.	Hanya ce.
Do not write something like other people if you can help him.	Kada ku rubuta wani abu kamar sauran mutane idan kuna iya taimaka masa.
She kept walking.	Ta ci gaba da tafiya.
We paid for them.	Mun biya su.
But they can't do anything. '	Amma ba za su iya yin komai ba'.
I know what they give me, however.	Na san abin da suke ba ni, duk da haka.
He is not of the world.	Shi ba na duniya ba ne.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
I can no longer see the error or right.	Ba zan iya ƙara ganin kuskure ko daidai ba.
He killed him.	Ya kashe shi.
Only once.	Sau ɗaya kawai.
He does not need to be serious.	Ba ya buƙatar zama da gaske.
Just shut up.	Ka rufe kawai.
We can't wait to hear it.	Ba za mu iya jira mu ji shi ba.
No need only.	Babu buƙatar kawai.
It took years before this decision was made.	An ɗauki shekaru kafin a yanke wannan shawarar.
More work.	Da ƙarin aiki.
Now it has changed.	Yanzu ya canza.
Equally fine with me.	Daidai lafiya tare da ni.
Actually there is nothing to do at home.	A gaskiya babu abin yi a gida.
I'm sure you do.	Na tabbata kuna yi.
God does not say anything.	Allah baya cewa komai.
Kids are my joy.	Yara farin ciki ne na.
I have nothing but a house.	Ba ni da komai ba tare da gidan ba.
There is nothing you can do.	Babu abin da za ku iya yi.
And so on.	Da sauran su.
It will be bigger.	Zai zama mafi girma.
Check back later.	Duba baya daga baya.
Initially it was a repair tool.	Da farko kayan aikin gyara ne.
Let's learn together.	Mu koyi tare.
She doesn't need to get up.	Bata bukatar ta tashi.
She agrees.	Ta yarda da haka.
Maybe nothing bigger.	Wataƙila babu abin da ya fi girma.
I just want to be me.	Ina so kawai in zama ni.
She called someone to do so.	Ta kira wani don yin haka.
Nothing to do.	Ba yin komai.
I want to fly to the moon.	Ina so in tashi zuwa wata.
He is trying to kill me.	Yana ƙoƙarin kashe ni.
In another article.	A wani labarin kuma.
At least he did not die.	Ko kadan bai mutu ba.
Everything is as it speaks.	Komai yana nan a yadda yake magana.
It is so.	Irin haka yake.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
They know him well.	Sun san shi sosai.
A good hot dog would be great.	Kyakkyawan kare mai zafi zai yi kyau.
We talked to you.	Mun yi magana da ku.
He is such.	Shi mai irin wannan ne.
She had to go back to the car to get that.	Sai da ta koma mota don samun hakan.
It seems they don't exist.	Kamar babu su.
Many did.	Haka mutane da yawa suka yi.
I tried many other things and nothing worked.	Na gwada wasu abubuwa da yawa kuma babu abin da ya yi aiki.
I think we need that.	Ina ganin muna bukatar hakan.
I will be back there tomorrow morning.	Zan koma can gobe da safe.
There is only one plane.	Akwai jirgin sama guda ɗaya kawai.
Like she still feels.	Kamar har yanzu tana ji.
I know the truth.	Na saba gaskiya.
I enjoyed my stay.	Na yi farin ciki da zama na.
He did not see anything unusual.	Bai ga wani abu da ya saba ba.
The game is waiting now.	Wasan jira ne yanzu.
Of course this is not good.	Tabbas wannan baya kyau.
He saw no reason to change them.	Bai ga dalilin canza su ba.
But it does not work.	Amma ba ya aiki.
He can do whatever he wants with her.	Zai iya yi da ita abin da ya ga dama.
We cannot live without water.	Ba za mu iya rayuwa ba tare da ruwa ba.
But now, it is a real problem for you.	Amma yanzu, matsala ce ta gaske a gare ku.
We would not recommend that children be there doing it.	Ba za mu ba da shawarar cewa yara suna can suna yin shi ba.
He did not care for her.	Bai kula ta ba.
And when he made a mistake.	Kuma a lokacin da ya yi kuskure.
And you love how it feels.	Kuma kuna son yadda yake ji.
I love that about her.	Ina son hakan game da ita.
She would not mind.	Ba za ta damu ba.
Now put the wet.	Yanzu sanya rigar.
I do not want to sleep.	Ba na son barci.
Maybe he won't kill her.	Wataƙila ba zai kashe ta ba.
It's more out.	Ya fi fita.
I bought it again	Na sake saya
She used to call me how.	Ta kan kira ni da yaya.
I think he is there.	Ina jin yana can.
Let us not be surprised.	Kada mu yi mamaki.
She left me and that was fine.	Ta bar ni kuma hakan yayi kyau.
Either way it didn't make her any happier.	Ko ta yaya hakan bai kara mata dadi ba.
It should.	Ya kamata.
I do not see other people alive.	Ba na ganin sauran mutane masu rai.
He is less than two years old.	Bai kai shekara biyu ba.
Which is definitely not true.	Wanda tabbas ba gaskiya bane.
', or to'.	', ko kuma zuwa'.
The place could not have been better.	Wurin ba zai iya zama mafi kyau ba.
The sun called for them to run.	Rana ta kira su da gudu.
People hated me for that.	Mutane sun ƙi ni don haka.
That's what she thought.	Haka ta yi tunani.
We used to do that very well.	Mun kasance muna yin hakan da kyau.
Give me.	Ba ni.
I think that will just continue.	Ina tsammanin hakan zai ci gaba ne kawai.
Be careful with the signature.	Yi hankali da sa hannu.
It's just beautiful.	Yana da kyau kawai.
She changed things.	Ta canza abubuwa.
Then slowly.	Sai a hankali.
When something is simple, people will use it.	Lokacin da wani abu ya kasance mai sauƙi, mutane za su yi amfani da shi.
Three, well, two of you.	Uku, da kyau, ku biyu.
So far no injuries.	Ya zuwa yanzu babu wani rauni.
There is no running water.	Babu ruwan gudu.
Out of service.	Ba ya aiki.
The first room is empty.	Dakin farko babu kowa.
Apparently no one wants to do that.	Da alama babu wanda yake son yin hakan.
I had to find out what happened to me and why.	Dole ne in gano abin da ya faru da ni kuma me yasa.
Eventually the effort began to pay off.	Daga ƙarshe ƙoƙarin ya fara biya.
He never got an answer.	Bai taba samun amsa ba.
We know how it works now.	Mun san yadda yake aiki a yanzu.
I could not enter, without people seeing.	Ba zan iya shiga ba, ba tare da mutane sun gani ba.
This is a dog.	Wannan shi ne kare.
Not necessarily a good thing.	Ba lallai ba ne abu mai kyau.
I think you are right.	Ina tsammanin kun yi gaskiya.
I'm not sure why so far.	Ban tabbata ba dalilin hakan har yanzu.
It is very cold at night.	Dare yayi sanyi sosai.
So, we decided not to respond.	Don haka, muka yanke shawarar ba su amsa.
We saw some funny and interesting things.	Mun ga wasu abubuwa masu ban dariya da ban sha'awa.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Babu abin da za ku iya yi game da shi.
Night after night.	Dare bayan dare.
In the end, you can bring back something good.	A ƙarshe, za ku iya dawo da wani abu mai kyau.
However, do something for me.	Duk da haka, yi mini wani abu.
That's what you want, isn't it?	Abin da kuke so ke nan, ko ba haka ba?
It is a boat.	Ita ce jirgin ruwa.
Let's have coffee.	Zo mu sha kofi.
From what? 	Daga me?
The first said.	In ji na farko.
I'm sure we will.	Na tabbata za mu yi.
I'm scared.	Ina tsoro.
They are right, of course.	Suna da gaskiya, ba shakka.
One scary moment, you know.	Lokaci guda mai ban tsoro, kun sani.
If not really before, now it is.	Idan ba da gaske ba a da, yanzu ya kasance.
He did not take it.	Bai dauka ba.
He didn't say anything to me.	Bai ce min komai ba.
But it almost never happened.	Amma kusan bai taba faruwa ba.
That the world has passed him by.	Cewa duniya ta wuce shi.
I don't know why that happened.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa hakan ya faru ba.
Just one thing.	Wani abu daya kawai.
So, the name.	Don haka, sunan.
It seems to be very hot.	Kamar yana da zafi sosai.
And we never looked for anything but money.	Kuma ba mu taba neman wani abu ba sai kudi.
She decided she needed a new job.	Ta yanke shawarar cewa tana bukatar sabon aiki.
The thought surprised me.	Tunanin ya ba ni mamaki.
I think it is very much needed.	Ina tsammanin ana bukata sosai.
He can play anything.	Zai iya wasa komai.
He was so weak that he died.	Ya kasance mai rauni har ya mutu.
That was not too much.	Hakan bai yi yawa ba.
It's not fair.	Ba shi da dama.
He would not have understood.	Da bai gane ba.
That thing will work, right?	Wannan abu zai yi aiki, daidai?
When people don’t succeed, they move on.	Lokacin da mutane ba su ci nasara ba, sun ci gaba.
He sat and waited.	Ya zauna yana jira.
I'll tell you tomorrow.	Zan gaya muku gobe.
So everything you tell me will not pass.	Don haka duk abin da ka gaya mani ba zai wuce ba.
But it is not necessary.	Amma ba dole ba ne.
It will not change.	Ba zai canza ba.
She asked me and me was enough.	Ta tambaye ni da ni ya isa.
Soon, we will talk.	Nan da nan, za mu yi magana.
I did not know myself from her.	Ban san kaina daga gare ta ba.
But it will not help.	Amma ba zai taimaka ba.
Wherever you are.	Duk inda kuke.
And it is still true.	Kuma har yanzu gaskiya ne.
Give it and you're done.	Ka ba shi kuma ka gama.
Maybe he should be optimistic about the future, he told himself.	Wataƙila ya kamata ya kasance mai kyau game da nan gaba, ya gaya wa kansa.
Wait a minute.	Jira kadan.
She decided to quit smoking, again.	Ta yanke shawarar daina shan taba, sake.
And it's kind of a journey.	Kuma irin tafiya ce.
This will not be forgotten.	Ba za a manta da wannan ba.
To explain it as it is.	Don bayyana shi kamar yadda yake.
If the water is on time, the best still.	Idan ruwan yana kan lokaci, mafi kyau har yanzu.
You have to wait, you all.	Dole ne ku jira, ku duka.
That's very good.	Hakan yayi kyau sosai.
We want everyone to know how much we enjoy it.	Mun so kowa ya san irin jin daɗin da muke yi.
It will never be enough.	Ba zai taba isa ba.
I look now.	Na duba yanzu.
Today brings the second.	Yau ya kawo na biyu.
In this he did the right thing.	A cikin wannan ya yi daidai.
And that's it.	Kuma shi ke nan.
They can not confirm what happened.	Ba za su iya tabbatar da abin da ya faru ba.
It was like a whole past life.	Ya zama kamar gaba ɗaya rayuwa da ta wuce.
You have to have a big fight.	Sai kun yi babban fada.
It is too late.	Dare yayi yawa.
We never sat down.	Ba mu taba zama ba.
There is nothing about any study that should surprise you.	Babu wani abu game da kowane karatu da ya kamata ya yi mamaki.
She was surprised to see.	Ta yi mamakin ganin.
When he left, he left.	Idan ya tafi, ya tafi.
Next something happens.	A gaba wani abu yana faruwa.
He came to us for help.	Ya zo mana don neman taimako.
I have to be there.	Dole ne in kasance a wurin.
This is not a time.	Wannan ba wani lokaci ba ne.
Everyone feels fine.	Kowa ya ji lafiya.
He told me one last time that he loved me.	Ya gaya mani a karo na ƙarshe cewa yana so na.
We are very close to success.	Mun fi kusa da nasara sosai.
She didn't hear anything at night.	Ba ta ji komai ba cikin dare.
But he knew she understood.	Amma ya san ta gane.
So shall you.	Haka kuma za ku.
Only they can do it.	Su kadai ne za su iya yi.
They said that at home.	Suka ce haka a gida.
It's good, it's good.	Yana da kyau, yana da kyau.
It really impressed me.	Ya bani sha'awa sosai.
You can't see the house, you say.	Ba ka iya ganin gidan, ka ce.
He is not even close to fixing it.	Bai ma kusa gyara ba.
They need money for accommodation and food.	Suna buƙatar kuɗi don wurin zama da abinci.
Some did.	Wasu sun yi.
They never thought they would, but they did.	Ba su taɓa tunanin za su yi ba, amma suna yi.
But it does not work.	Amma ba ya aiki.
This one is hard to hope for.	Wannan da ya yi wuya a yi fata.
It was a scary cold day.	Ranar sanyi ce mai ban tsoro.
Otherwise, say nothing.	In ba haka ba, kada ku ce komai.
There are some things that no one can escape.	Akwai wasu abubuwan da babu wanda mutum zai iya gudu daga gare su.
Not like us.	Ba kamar mu ba ne.
It was taken care of, the best way we could.	An kula da shi, mafi kyawun hanyar da za mu iya.
No one can.	Babu wanda zai iya.
Whatever it takes, you do.	Duk abin da ya ɗauka, kuna yi.
This is the night.	Wannan dare ne.
I called again, again, again.	Na sake kira, da sake, da sake.
That's what she does.	Abin da take yi kenan.
But otherwise, nothing.	Amma in ba haka ba, babu komai.
I have to admit that it was good for him.	Dole ne in yarda cewa yana da kyau a gare shi.
And they refused.	Kuma suka ƙi.
She knew in that look that he had not spoken.	Ita da ta san haka ba ta ce komai ba.
You have no one here about this with you.	Ba ku da kowa a nan game da wannan tare da ku.
It is an unusually hot day.	Ranar zafi ce da ba a saba gani ba.
Maybe we should stop working.	Wataƙila mu daina aiki.
This is a movie.	Wannan fim ne.
It's too fast.	Yayi sauri sosai.
They tell us ahead of time everything.	Suna gaya mana gaba da komai.
The three of them entered.	Su uku suka shiga.
It's so amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki sosai.
Maybe you even remember him as a kid.	Wataƙila ma tuna shi yana yaro.
At the same time, amazing things happened.	A lokaci guda kuma, abubuwan ban mamaki sun faru.
So let me tell you again.	Don haka sai a sake fada maka.
Sorry not sorry.	Yi hakuri ba hakuri.
I'm not sure what this is.	Ban tabbatar da menene wannan ba.
Truth is enough, somehow, over truth.	Gaskiya isa, ko ta yaya, akan gaskiya.
I didn’t put it there.	Ban sanya shi a wurin ba.
They must be the answer to you.	Dole ne su zama amsa a wurin ku.
Not true.	Ba gaskiya bane.
He looked at the moon.	Ya kalli wata.
I tell you how.	Ina gaya muku yadda.
It was interesting to see how she discovered something completely new.	Yana da ban sha'awa ganin yadda ta gano wani sabon abu gaba daya.
I totally agree with her.	Na yarda da ita gaba daya.
Yet even the best of things can break.	Duk da haka ko da mafi kyawun abubuwa na iya karya.
He has been married before.	Ya yi aure a baya.
The reader will ask how everyone knows this.	Mai karatu zai tambayi ta yaya kowa zai san wannan.
But do not start drinking.	Amma kar ka fara sha.
Interesting, of course.	Abin sha'awa, ba shakka.
As it will.	Kamar yadda zai yi.
It's not cool.	Ba sanyi yayi kyau ba.
I think you will know that.	Ina tsammanin za ku san hakan.
Sometimes this does not work.	Wani lokaci wannan baya aiki.
Maybe just drink whatever.	Wataƙila kawai sha ko menene.
This is how it should be.	Wannan shi ne yadda ya kamata.
He could not change the world.	Ya kasa canza duniya.
We have to film once.	Dole ne mu yi fim sau ɗaya.
He will hear the man come out.	Zai ji mutumin ya fita.
She went slowly.	Ta tafi hankali.
They have not worked in years.	Ba su yi aiki a cikin shekaru ba.
Not in life.	Ba a cikin rayuwa ba.
Everything was true.	Duk ya kasance gaskiya.
Play.	Yi wasa.
The way she loves it.	Yadda take son shi.
It's just right.	Daidai ne kawai.
Have a life !!!!!!!!!!!!.	Samun rayuwa!!!!!!!!!!!!.
This woman is pregnant.	Wannan mata tana da ciki.
He was just trying to help.	Yana ƙoƙari kawai ya taimaka.
But sometimes it happens.	Amma wani lokacin yana faruwa.
There is something wrong with her.	Akwai wani abu game da ita wanda bai dace ba.
Definitely buy more.	Tabbas siyan ƙarin.
A real book.	Littafin gaske.
I was surprised to be able to speak.	Na yi mamakin iya magana.
I have prepared well for you.	Na shirya maka sosai.
This year, next year, whoever knows the year.	A wannan shekara, shekara mai zuwa, ko wanene ya san shekara.
But that is not the main thing.	Amma wannan ba shine babban abin ba.
It is the only way.	Ita ce kawai hanya.
This can be seen in the following way.	Ana iya ganin wannan ta hanya mai zuwa.
Well done and keep up the good work.	Da kyau kuma ku ci gaba da aikin.
We proved that she was.	Mun tabbatar da cewa ita ce.
I said.	Na ce.
Not specified at all.	Ba a bayyana gaba ɗaya ba.
Feelings have changed.	Ji ya canza.
I didn't expect you to know this.	Da ban yi tsammanin za ku san wannan ba.
Many refuse to do so.	Mutane da yawa sun ƙi yin hakan.
My feeling will hurt.	Ji na zai yi rauni.
I haven't spoken to her since.	Tun lokacin ban yi mata magana ba.
But it worked.	Amma ya yi aiki.
He does what he wants to do.	Yana yin abin da yake so ya yi.
We planned this project for a week.	Mun shirya wannan aikin na mako guda.
When he came, he was terrified.	Lokacin da ya zo, ya zama mai ban tsoro.
After that it all appeared.	Bayan haka duk ya bayyana.
It worked well.	Ya yi aiki da kyau.
But you are right.	Amma kun yi gaskiya.
This time is a pleasure.	Wannan lokacin yana da daɗi.
But there is no answer.	Amma babu wata amsa.
He can't, he can't.	Ba zai yi ba, ba zai iya ba.
But not everyone is happy.	Amma ba kowa ya yi farin ciki da hakan ba.
Maybe that's why nothing happened.	Wataƙila shi ya sa babu abin da ya faru.
Yet he wants to know.	Amma duk da haka yana so ya sani.
If there is something to do and come back.	Idan akwai yi wani abu kuma ya dawo.
Let me give you one piece of food for me.	Bari in ba ku abinci guda ɗaya a kaina.
Had you been there.	Da kun kasance a wurin.
You are in this article.	Kuna cikin wannan labarin.
But this is really next.	Amma wannan da gaske na gaba.
Many did.	Mutane da yawa sun yi.
It is completely internal.	Yana da gaba ɗaya na ciki.
I was the last one to go.	Ni ne na ƙarshe da zan tafi.
it is a waste of time.	bata lokaci ne.
In fact, this is true.	A gaskiya, wannan gaskiya ne.
She desperately needs help.	Ta yi matukar bukatar taimako.
This has never happened before.	Wannan bai taba faruwa a baya ba.
Maybe even a place.	Wataƙila ma wuri.
And you got it.	Kuma kun samu.
But she is here now.	Amma tana nan yanzu.
No problem there.	Babu matsala a can.
But you are there.	Amma kuna can.
There is still no happiness.	Har yanzu babu farin ciki.
I will spend a lot of time taking it.	Zan kashe tsawon lokacin da ake ɗauka.
One cannot do without one.	Daya ba zai iya yi ba tare da daya.
That's why it works.	Shi ya sa yake aiki.
You keep going anyway.	Kuna ci gaba da tafiya ta kowace hanya.
That would be fine.	Hakan zai yi daidai.
Let's say.	A ce.
The night passed slowly.	Dare ya wuce a hankali.
He had to say.	Sai da ya ce.
Only one of the two can be used at the same time.	Za a iya amfani da ɗaya daga cikin biyu kawai a lokaci guda.
You have to run to something.	Dole ne ku yi gudu zuwa wani abu.
They must be.	Dole ne su kasance.
Little did anyone know I was better.	Kadan kowa ya san ni ya fi kyau.
Make sure it is correct.	Tabbatar daidai ne.
They will help you, he said.	Za su taimake ku, in ji shi.
But she can do this.	Amma ta iya yin wannan.
Only two left.	Biyu ne kawai suka tafi.
They talk.	Suna magana.
I'm watching you, he said.	Ina kallon ku, ya ce.
The world can always use the good.	Duniya na iya ko da yaushe amfani da mai kyau.
It’s something, isn’t it.	Wani abu ne, ko ba haka ba ne.
So she has to go home again.	Don haka dole ta sake tafiya har gida.
Let's forget, together, what we suffered.	Mu manta, tare, abin da muka sha wahala.
They will come.	Za su zo.
Now we stop flying altogether.	Yanzu mun daina tashi gaba daya.
It is not so.	Ba haka ba ne.
It makes her happy.	Yana mata dadi.
It grew rapidly.	Ya girma cikin sauri.
Actually there is nothing I can do.	A gaskiya babu abin da zan yi.
Very happy to recommend.	Mai farin ciki sosai shawarar.
I want more.	Ina so in fi haka.
This is where everyone makes a mistake.	Wannan shi ne inda duk ya yi kuskure.
So she started crying.	Haka ta fara kuka.
In this way.	Ta wannan hanya.
I went but you can get them for sure.	Na je amma za ku iya samun su tabbas.
Maybe you do too.	Wataƙila ku ma kuna yi.
I still don't care.	Har yanzu ban damu ba.
She decided to sing again.	Ta yanke shawarar sake yin waƙa.
If he goes back there he will see.	Idan ya koma can zai gani.
There must be some error.	Dole ne a sami ɗan kuskure.
I wrote them.	Na rubuta su.
We have to work together.	Dole ne mu yi aiki tare.
Now just think about this for a moment.	Yanzu kawai ka yi tunanin wannan na ɗan lokaci.
He heard.	Ya ji.
It may be hard, but it happens.	Yana iya zama da wuya, amma yana faruwa.
Tell him again.	Ka sake gaya masa.
He killed them.	Ya kashe su.
I want to pay and get out of there.	Ina so in biya kuma in fita daga can.
They will be.	Za su kasance.
Their price is good.	Kuɗin su yana da kyau.
By everyone.	Da kowane mutum.
But that's it.	Amma shi ke nan.
She sleeps next to me every night.	Tana kwana kusa da ni kowane dare.
But it is of no use.	Amma ba ta da wani amfani.
She told him many things.	Ta gaya masa abubuwa da dama.
It has to grow.	Dole ne ya girma.
He has to do what he has to do.	Dole ne ya yi abin da zai yi.
So everything will look fine.	Don haka komai zai duba lafiya.
She may have been seriously injured.	Wataƙila ta ji rauni sosai.
Impatience will lead to his death.	Rashin hakuri zai sa a kashe shi.
For years now.	Shekaru yanzu.
In this they made a mistake.	A cikin wannan sun yi kuskure.
This program is not working properly.	Wannan shirin ba ya tafiya daidai.
First, water later.	Da farko, ruwa daga baya.
It is a beautiful place.	Wuri ne mai kyau.
Come and do something.	Ka zo ka yi wani abu.
Touch here.	A taba nan.
The name is familiar, but she doesn't know why.	Sunan ya saba, amma ba ta san dalilin ba.
We will never be.	Ba za mu taba zama ba.
They know what happened.	Sun san abin da ya faru.
Perhaps doing so is not necessary.	Wataƙila yin hakan bai zama dole ba.
He is sick.	Ba shi da lafiya.
It shows us we have to go slowly, slowly.	Ya nuna mana dole ne mu tafi a hankali, a hankali.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
Everyone is more fun!	Kowa ya fi wasa!
It was easy to like.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi a so.
So upstairs.	Don haka sama sama.
The train is there now.	Jirgin yana can yanzu.
Do not, and when you enter do not touch anything.	Kada ku yi, kuma idan kun shiga kada ku taɓa wani abu.
I have to take one.	Dole in dauki daya.
So we don’t have much work to do.	Don haka ba mu da aiki da yawa.
He really liked it.	Ya so shi sosai.
I was only there one night.	Dare daya kawai nake can.
One was published.	An buga guda ɗaya.
I advised him to go.	Na ba shi shawarar ya tafi.
This call is still a mistake.	Kira nan duk da haka kuskure ne.
Maybe he wanted to lose them, afraid to see the truth.	Wataƙila ya so ya rasa su, yana tsoron ganin gaskiya.
As will be done next week.	Kamar yadda za a yi mako mai zuwa.
She just stayed at home.	Sai kawai ta zauna a gida.
Everything is better in the morning.	Komai ya fi kyau da safe.
We help many people.	Muna ba da taimako ga mutane da yawa.
He eats and begins to think.	Yana cin abinci ya fara tunani.
That must be good.	Dole ne hakan yayi kyau.
Simple and good.	Mai sauƙi kuma mai kyau.
nailed it	na samu
Try not to give up.	Yi ƙoƙarin kada ku daina.
That came and went.	Hakan ya zo ya tafi.
Her dress is not comfortable.	Rigar ta ba ta da kyau.
It's very interesting.	Yayi ban sha'awa sosai.
It is.	Abu ne.
But really, people.	Amma da gaske, mutane.
Sometimes you can't succeed.	Wani lokaci ba za ku iya yin nasara ba.
No one wants to be around working people.	Ba wanda yake son zama kusa da mutane masu aiki.
He is doing what he wants now.	Yana yin abin da yake so yanzu.
Not many know me.	Ba da yawa sun san ni ba.
At work.	Akan aiki.
I can say that it seems to have succeeded.	Zan iya cewa da alama an yi nasara.
And they were right.	Kuma sun yi daidai.
The food is prepared using a simple tool.	An shirya abinci ta amfani da kayan aiki mai sauƙi.
He still hasn't left me.	Har yanzu bai bar ni ba.
You only look for trouble if you do !.	Kuna neman matsala ne kawai idan kun yi!.
No, no, no sleep.	A'a, a'a, babu barci.
We have to keep talking about it.	Dole ne mu ci gaba da magana a kai.
She could not see.	Ta kasa gani.
Maybe she really did.	Wataƙila da gaske ta yi.
He wanted to know.	Ya so ya sani.
She doesn't really need it.	Ba ta buƙatar gaske.
He should have killed him.	Ya kamata ya kashe shi.
What it should be.	Abin da ya kamata ya kasance.
It's not good.	Ba yayi kyau.
It's a great movie.	Babban fim ne.
It is the only way to enter.	Ita ce kawai hanyar shiga.
No one needs it anymore.	Babu wanda ke buƙatar shi kuma.
There are more interesting things they can do with it.	Akwai ƙarin abubuwa masu ban sha'awa da za su iya yi da shi.
I don't want him to know this.	Ba na son ya san wannan.
She is injured.	Ta ji rauni.
She wanted to go.	Ta so ta tafi.
Two people gave me a job.	Mutane biyu sun ba ni aiki.
People think there is only one thing.	Mutane suna tsammanin abu ɗaya ne kawai.
She did it.	Ta yi shi.
She will fight.	Zata yi fada.
Do you see this dog there?	Kuna ganin wannan kare a can?
He never knew.	Bai taba sani ba.
The truth is very good.	Gaskiya yayi kyau sosai.
This is not fair.	Wannan bai dace ba.
I agree you are right, he said.	Na yarda kana da gaskiya, in ji shi.
And this is not the right time to make that statement.	Kuma wannan ba shine lokacin da ya dace don yin wannan magana ba.
Now you are going to die.	Yanzu za ku mutu.
Looking at unemployment is too much.	Kallon rashin aikin yi yayi yawa.
It is very difficult.	Yana da matukar wahala.
No, no, we can't hear.	A'a, a'a, ba mu iya ji.
I find that he is very interested in you.	Na ga cewa yana sha'awar ku sosai.
This thing is difficult.	Wannan abin yana da wahala.
Run from the dog.	Gudu daga kare.
You can no longer explain it.	Ba za ku iya ƙara bayyana shi ba.
I'm trying to feel it.	Ina gwada ji na.
They are made with care.	An yi su ne ta hanyar hankali.
It’s amazing that it works overall.	Yana da ban mamaki cewa yana aiki gaba ɗaya.
Maybe there are too many.	Wataƙila akwai su da yawa.
I read things here and there.	Na karanta abubuwa nan da can.
They will definitely let us go.	Da gaske za su bar mu mu tafi.
Good job on that !.	Kyakkyawan aiki akan wannan!.
I think there is nothing about it that will surprise me right now.	Ina tsammanin babu wani abu game da shi da zai ba ni mamaki yanzu.
She doesn't like it.	Ba ta son shi.
No country in the world recognizes him.	Babu wata kasa a duniya da ta gane shi.
I forgot things.	Na manta abubuwa.
I did not send.	Ban aika ba.
It's time to dump her.	Lokaci yayi da za a tashi.
Something has to stop.	Dole ne wani abu ya tsaya.
No one understood.	Babu wanda ya gane.
They are sure he is lying.	Sun tabbata karya yake yi.
Many are unprepared.	Mutane da yawa ba su shirya ba.
Week and week for the whole.	Mako da mako ga gaba ɗaya.
They are looking for a new home.	Suna neman sabon gida.
I do a lot of difficult things.	Ina yin abubuwa da yawa da wahala.
But she knew it.	Amma ta san shi.
She got ready, quickly because the room was cold.	Ta shirya, da sauri saboda dakin yayi sanyi.
Well as it got then.	Da kyau kamar yadda ya samu a lokacin.
I went in three.	Na tafi a uku.
Everything he said was correct.	Duk abin da ya faɗa ya yi daidai.
This made the man doubtful.	Hakan ya sa mutumin ya yi shakka.
So something is happening.	Don haka wani abu ke faruwa.
No one gets a second trip.	Babu wanda ke samun tafiya ta biyu.
However, it is not so difficult, as you will see here.	Duk da haka, ba haka ba ne mai wahala, kamar yadda za ku gani a nan.
One has to keep things simple.	Dole ne mutum ya ci gaba da abubuwa.
It just doesn't work.	Kawai baya aiki.
I plan, however.	Na shirya, duk da haka.
She decided to make it two houses.	Ta yanke shawarar yin shi gida biyu.
That is what they are doing from now on.	Abin da suke yi kenan daga yanzu.
I totally agree.	Na yarda gaba daya.
I said no, not you.	Na ce a'a, ba ku.
But she did.	Amma ta yi.
Beat it well.	Duka shi da kyau.
Everything is fine.	Komai yayi kyau.
She hurried to come and help.	Ta yi sauri ta zo don ta taimaka.
There is nothing he can do.	Babu abin da zai iya yi.
Not even close.	Ba ma kusa ba.
Maybe we want to talk about it.	Wataƙila muna son magana game da shi.
But he knew he had to do something.	Amma ya san dole ya yi wani abu.
She thought for a moment before speaking.	Ta dan yi tunani kafin ta yi magana.
Take it with you.	Ku tafi da shi.
For many people it is just too much.	Ga mutane da yawa kawai ya yi yawa.
I know the way out right.	Na san hanyar fita daidai.
I myself have heard.	Ni kaina na ji.
I wouldn’t say it’s bigger than that.	Ba zan ce shi ya fi girma haka ba.
God do not let him die.	Allah kada ka bar shi ya mutu.
It's about what you don't like.	Yana da game da abin da ba ka so.
She did not know who the man was.	Ba ta san ko wanene mutumin ba.
Sorry man.	Yi hakuri mutum.
We are not required to go to school.	Ba a buƙatar mu zuwa makaranta.
In what has been heard, let alone heard.	A cikin abin da aka ji, bari kawai a ji.
No one can make me do them.	Ba wanda zai iya sa ni in yi su.
Because it is.	Don shi ne.
They walk slowly.	Tafiya suke a hankali.
We go through them.	Muna shiga ta cikin su.
The man looked up.	Mutumin ya duba.
People must hear it.	Dole ne mutane su ji shi.
I will not leave them.	Ba zan bar su ba.
We spent the night on the beach.	Muka kwana a bakin ruwa.
There is no point in doing so.	Babu wani amfani a yin hakan.
You should know that.	Lallai ya kamata ku san hakan.
We have to run.	Dole ne mu gudu.
This sounds like a difficult problem.	Wannan yana kama da matsala mai wahala.
saying.	yana cewa.
Or he has no more than that.	Ko kuma ba ya da fiye da haka.
But still she didn’t do it for us.	Amma duk da haka ba ta yi mana ba.
A similar problem has occurred in the past.	Irin wannan matsala ta faru a baya.
Remove everything that should not be eaten.	Cire duk abin da bai kamata a ci ba.
Don't do it if you don't like it.	Kada ku yi idan ba ku son shi.
There should be as many as.	Kamata ya yi a samu da yawa kamar su.
They think you will never know.	Suna tsammanin ba za ku sani ba.
Maybe you don't remember me.	Wataƙila ba ku tuna da ni ba.
They are difficult.	Suna da wahala.
Many people.	Mutane da yawa.
Sometimes she would never let me touch her.	Wani lokacin ma ba za ta bari in taba ta ba.
He had to laugh all by himself.	Sai da yayi dariya duk da kansa.
If you do, don't give up.	Idan kun yi haka, kada ku daina.
It is confirmed to be in progress next month.	An tabbatar da shi kamar yadda ake ci gaba a wata mai zuwa.
I caught him.	Na kama shi.
Work is fine.	Aiki daidai yake.
All on you.	Duk a kan ku.
It’s done well and it’s good.	An yi shi da kyau kuma yana da kyau.
He was out of place.	Ya kasance daga wurin.
I could not wait to get there.	Na kasa jira na isa wurin.
And start crying.	Kuma fara kuka.
After one.	Bayan daya ne.
Unlike others here, because.	Ba kamar wasu ba a nan, saboda.
I like this	Ina son wannan
This is not a place for people like us.	Wannan ba kowane irin wuri bane ga mutane kamar mu.
It was taken quickly, and very quickly.	An ɗauka da sauri, kuma da sauri da sauri.
No games were played.	Babu wasa da aka yi.
It’s not fun, and it’s hard.	Ba abin jin daɗi ba ne, kuma yana da wahala.
You will not get much benefit from this.	Ba za ku sami amfani mai yawa daga wannan ba.
So, sure, it will pass.	Don haka, ka tabbata, zai wuce.
They all know who he is.	Duk sun san ko wanene shi.
No child.	Babu yaro.
I have never used them.	Ban taba amfani da su ba.
Many people came.	Mutane da yawa sun zo.
This will not work at this time.	Wannan ba zai yi aiki ba a wannan lokacin.
It can be amazing.	Zai iya zama mai ban mamaki.
No one laughed.	Ba wanda ya yi dariya.
One day, they can play this ball.	Wata rana, za su iya buga wannan ƙwallon.
If we were to see.	Idan mun kasance muna gani.
They had not been together for many years.	Ba su taɓa zama tare ba tun shekaru da yawa.
You know it will still go away.	Kun san har yanzu zai tafi.
When you get close, get in and catch up.	Lokacin da kuka shiga kusa, shiga ku kama.
I want to ask you about that.	Ina so in tambaye ku game da hakan.
It may just be about something guaranteed.	Yana iya zama kawai game da wani abu tabbas.
The doctor removed the water.	Likitan ya cire ruwan.
I finally got there.	Na isa can a ƙarshe.
It is a workbook published.	Littafin aiki ne da aka buga.
It can be done by hand.	Ana iya yin shi da hannu.
I called the police and waited for them.	Na kira ’yan sanda na jira su.
I was home all week.	Na kasance gida duk mako.
Everyone needs to do that.	Kowa yana bukatar yin hakan.
But not for lack of opportunity.	Amma ba don rashin dama ba.
Only one thing can cover this need.	Abu daya ne kawai zai iya rufe wannan bukata.
Of course he did.	Lallai ya yi.
So that doesn't work.	Don haka hakan baya aiki.
Some did.	Wasu sun yi.
I have no hope this will work.	Ba ni da fata wannan zai yi aiki.
I will break it.	Zan karya shi.
That is not right.	Hakan bai yi daidai ba.
It grows bigger and harder to find water.	Ya ƙara girma da wuya a sami ruwa.
You have to work for life, not life to work.	Ya kamata ku yi aiki don rayuwa, ba rayuwa don yin aiki ba.
Every day, we still need each other.	Kowace rana, muna bukatar juna har yanzu.
Maybe she changed it.	Watakila ta canza shi.
We want it to be as fast and easy as possible.	Muna son ya zama kamar sauri da sauƙi.
I will never accept that.	Ba zan taba yarda da hakan ba.
The meeting was well organized.	An shirya taron sosai.
He was not injured.	Bai ji rauni ba.
I often wonder if that is how everyone feels.	Sau da yawa ina mamakin ko haka ne kowa yake ji.
How does this work?	Yaya wannan yake aiki?
Just remember that.	Kawai tuna cewa.
And to say that nothing is right is not the answer.	Kuma a ce babu abin da ya dace ba amsa ba ne.
It was a beautiful day, sun.	Wata rana ce mai kyau, rana.
Such is the world.	Irin wannan duniya ce.
But you can't talk to strangers.	Amma ba za ku iya yin magana da wanda ba ku sani ba.
I don’t know if anyone won, or if someone died.	Ban sani ba ko wani ya yi nasara, ko wani ya mutu.
Sometimes they are three.	Wani lokaci su uku ne.
He was like a big brother.	Ya kasance kamar babban yaya.
he thought.	yayi tunani.
But leave me out of it.	Amma ka bar ni daga ciki.
I beg to differ.	Ban yarda ba.
They are good, but not necessary.	Suna da kyau, amma ba dole ba.
Forget about spending money on home.	Manta game da kashe kuɗin gida.
But there you are.	Amma akwai ku.
We will talk to him.	Za mu yi magana da shi.
They wanted her out.	Sun so ta fita.
You made it work.	Kun sanya shi aiki.
You grow when you have the opportunity to grow.	Kun girma lokacin da kuka sami damar girma.
We are in this together.	Muna cikin wannan tare.
I take care of people.	Ina kula da mutane.
He also knew nothing.	Shi ma bai san komai ba.
I'm sure you'll find another way to take care of me again.	Na tabbata za ku sake neman hanyar da za ku kula da ni kuma.
They just appeared.	Sun bayyana kawai.
This is why they can break.	Wannan shi ne dalilin da za su iya karya.
Even as she continued.	Har ma da ta ci gaba.
I think this is correct.	Ina ganin wannan daidai ne.
I'm just growing up.	Ina girma kawai.
You do a great job here.	Kuna yin babban aiki a nan.
I am very happy about that.	Ina matukar farin ciki da hakan.
But she will stand alone.	Amma ita kadai za ta tsaya.
Then up.	Sai kuma sama.
But this is not the case.	Amma wannan ba haka yake ba.
But even without that.	Amma ko da ba tare da wannan ba.
I didn’t defend myself at all.	Ban kare kaina ba ko kadan.
That could be.	Hakan na iya zama.
And it will.	Kuma zai yi.
She never told me about this.	Ba ta taba bani labarin wannan ba.
I am three years old.	Ina da shekara uku.
Of course something is better than nothing.	Tabbas wani abu ya fi komai kyau.
It is better to be safe and patient.	Gara a zauna lafiya da hakuri.
Don't let it go yet.	Kar a bari a tafi tukuna.
You are the people.	Ku ne mutane.
Then another, another.	Sai wani, da wani.
We will do the same next month.	Haka za mu yi wata mai zuwa.
Not my favorite.	Ba abin da na fi so ba.
How they work.	Yadda suke aiki.
So it was a really good tool.	Don haka ya kasance ainihin kayan aiki mai kyau.
People know this place.	Mutane sun san wannan wuri.
That is what they want us to do.	Abin da suke so mu yi ke nan.
This is a kind of feeling.	Wannan wani irin ji ne.
I have the best home for you.	Ina da mafi kyawun gida a gare ku.
And you know why.	Kuma kun san dalilin.
Show me where it is.	Nuna min inda yake.
I asked him if he was ever scared?	Na tambaye shi ko ya taba jin tsoro?
It is better to do it early than later.	Zai fi kyau a yi shi da wuri fiye da daga baya.
Maybe that's what he wants me to hear.	Wataƙila haka yake so in ji.
It is raining.	Ruwan sama ya kasa zuwa.
We need to get back to the point.	Muna bukatar mu koma kan abu.
It happens now.	Yana faruwa yanzu.
I am working to find a place to stay.	Ina aiki don neman wurin zama.
We must be.	Dole ne mu kasance.
He’s doing the next job.	Yana yin aikin na gaba.
He saw and won.	Ya gani kuma ya ci nasara.
I care about my players.	Na damu da 'yan wasa na.
Walk on the road and enjoy the view.	Yi tafiya a kan hanya kuma ku ji daɗin gani.
But we all know that life is not like that.	Amma duk mun san rayuwa ba haka take ba.
He is after what he will eat.	Yana bayan abin da zai ci.
The desire to be human like everyone else.	Sha'awar zama mutum kamar kowa.
He loves her very much.	Yana son ta sosai.
Time went by slowly.	Lokaci ya tafi a hankali.
I trust you guys.	Na yarda da ku mutane.
He said that was it.	Yace shi kenan.
That's when he said.	A lokacin ne ya ce.
There is no way to know.	Babu hanyar sani.
The rest of us will pay.	Sauran mu ne za mu biya.
They called the police.	Suka kira 'yan sanda.
He was happy when he got a new job.	Ya yi farin ciki lokacin da ya sami sabon aiki.
She gives it to you.	Ta ba ka.
No one has ever seen one.	Ba wanda ya taɓa ganin ɗaya.
The book is not there.	Littafin bai kasance a can ba.
Need to have someone inside of me.	Bukatar samun wani a ciki na.
They want a place.	Sun so wuri.
But of course.	Amma ba shakka.
Honestly if we eat it.	Gaskiya in za mu ci ta.
There is nothing out of it.	Babu wani abu daga ciki.
She felt like she always did something new.	Ji take kamar kullum sai ta yi sabon abu.
It is exactly as you described.	Daidai ne kamar yadda kuka bayyana.
Some people do not want to do that.	Wasu mutane ba sa son yin hakan.
He doesn't need anything.	Ba ya bukatar komai.
It's so delicious.	Yana da dadi sosai.
We did not see what we should see.	Ba mu ga abin da ya kamata mu gani ba.
You have only one life.	Kuna da rai guda ɗaya kawai.
She said a lot.	Ta fad'a da yawa.
I have recommended it to many people over the years.	Na ba da shawarar shi ga mutane da yawa tsawon shekaru.
Ailment	Rashin lafiya
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
I don't want anything to do with it.	Ba na son wani abu da ya kara yi da shi.
Maybe that's it.	Wataƙila shi ke nan.
I ate nothing.	Ban ci komai ba.
I can’t get down on my knees on this one.	Ba zan iya yin kasa a gwiwa ba akan wannan.
And he helped her.	Kuma ya taimake ta.
When he did, laughter broke out again.	Da ya yi, dariya ta sake tashi.
Great title, great movie.	Babban take, babban fim.
I can work all day.	Zan iya aiki duk rana.
Not seen today.	Ba a gani a yau.
It was like, well, this kind of work for me.	Ya kasance kamar, da kyau, wannan irin aiki ne a gare ni.
We do not often have access to it.	Ba sau da yawa muna samun dama ba.
Do not talk while eating.	Kada ku yi magana lokacin da kuke cin abinci.
You can't do that with kids.	Ba za ku iya yin hakan tare da yara ba.
I took it.	Na dauka.
It will be a success.	Zai zama nasara.
He said yes.	Yace haka ne.
Lots of coffee, whether you like it or not.	Kofi da yawa, ko kuna so ko a'a.
Something terrible happened.	Wani abu mai ban tsoro ya faru.
Now, let's see if you can do that.	Yanzu, bari mu ga ko za ku iya yin wannan.
This is difficult.	Wannan yana da wahala.
I'm moving fast '.	Ina tafiya da sauri'.
We are all sick.	Duk muna rashin lafiya.
Now, you can have a seat.	Yanzu, kuna iya samun wurin zama.
We seem to be doing well so far.	Da alama muna yin kyau ya zuwa yanzu.
It's just the end.	Ƙarshe ne kawai.
We will be back with you shortly.	Za mu dawo tare da ku nan da ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Don't worry about it for the moment.	Kada ku damu da shi don lokacin.
He did not laugh.	Ba dariya ba ya ce.
Not necessarily.	Ba lallai ba ne.
Too much oil.	An samu mai da yawa.
This is the first problem.	Wannan ita ce matsala ta farko.
No, that is not fair.	A'a, hakan ma bai dace ba.
Some people do it often.	Wasu mutane suna yin ta sau da yawa.
Can we travel in time?	Za mu iya tafiya cikin lokaci?
And that, he explained, is the problem.	Kuma wannan, ya bayyana, shine matsalar.
Exactly exactly.	Daidai daidai.
He cares for you.	Yana kula da ku.
But please, hopefully it will be back tomorrow.	Amma don Allah, da fatan za a dawo gobe.
Not now.	Ba yanzu ba ne.
So if this is, you know, the biggest one.	Don haka idan wannan shine, kun sani, shine mafi girma.
So say.	Don haka ka ce.
Let me know how it goes !.	Bari in san yadda abin yake!.
I need to run faster.	Ina bukata in kara gudu.
Here they are.	Ga su nan.
Your plan is working.	Shirin ku yana aiki.
And it was the first !.	Kuma shi ne na farko!.
He lost his head.	Ya bata kai.
More than enough.	Fiye da isa.
It helps me get out.	Yana taimaka min fita.
After three years.	Bayan shekaru uku.
They have made great progress.	Sun sami ci gaba sosai.
Done or died.	An yi ko mutu.
We are traveling.	Muna tafiya.
Check it out.	Duba ta.
What is needed.	Abin da ake bukata.
But if he stays somewhere she will think he did not.	Amma idan ya zauna a wani waje za ta yi tunanin bai yi ba.
They are watching her from behind.	Kallon ta suke ta baya.
People need heat.	Mutane na bukatar zafi.
It's more than that.	Ya fi haka.
The past is behind us.	Abin da ya wuce yana bayan mu.
She is very beautiful.	Tana da kyau sosai.
He is not happy now.	Bai yi farin ciki ba yanzu.
He doesn't want her to be afraid, he wants her to grow up.	Baya son ta ji tsoro, yana son ta girma.
He carefully placed it.	Ya ajiye ta a hankali.
I will give you everything.	Zan baka komai.
And everything went fast, fast, fast.	Kuma komai ya tafi da sauri, sauri, sauri.
Looking to be alive.	Kallon zama mai rai.
Of course nothing.	Ba shakka babu komai.
With a kind.	Da wani irin.
She loves him in every way.	Tana son shi ta kowace hanya.
Last night.	A kare dare dare.
I will check at the same time.	Zan duba a lokaci guda.
Try to feel comfortable about the whole thing.	Yi ƙoƙarin jin daɗi game da duka abu.
No, you should not.	A'a, bai kamata ku yi ba.
It is not removed.	Bata cire ba.
Nothing is enough.	Babu abin da ya isa.
Not in a week.	Ba a cikin mako guda ba.
Not because she was going home.	Ba don ta koma gida ba.
You have me.	Kuna da ni.
When you get to the car, sit there.	Idan kun isa mota, ku zauna a can.
This can be shown in the following way.	Ana iya nuna wannan ta hanya mai zuwa.
I would not recommend using them.	Ba zan ba da shawarar amfani da su ba.
I'm coming to stay.	Ina zuwa na zauna.
I just don’t like that tonight.	Kawai ba na son wannan daren yau.
The previous one is now fake.	Wanda ya gabata yanzu karya ne.
I did exactly what you said.	Na yi daidai abin da kuka ce.
They are very close now.	Suna kusa sosai yanzu.
She is sure to understand.	Ya tabbata zata gane.
It's over, he said.	Ya gama, yace.
He should eat something.	Ya kamata ya ci wani abu.
I think this approach will cause more problems than it should.	Ina ganin wannan hanyar za ta kawo matsala fiye da yadda ya kamata.
I can't do what they do.	Ba zan iya yin abin da suke yi ba.
Do not be afraid.	Kar ku ji tsoro.
The night is gone and he is back.	Dare ya bata ya dawo.
She is beautiful and cool.	Tana da kyau da sanyi.
I did well	Na yi kyau
I just want to be the best.	Ina so kawai in zama mafi kyau.
So this is for you.	Don haka wannan a gare ku ne.
Can't see this is useless?	Ba zai iya ganin wannan ba shi da amfani?
There is so much to do.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a yi.
This must be the place!	Wannan dole ne wurin!
That is difficult.	Hakan yana da wahala.
I think you are.	Ina tsammanin kai ne.
They kill each other.	Su kashe juna.
He thought so.	Ya yi tunanin haka.
Be the best you can be.	Kasance mafi kyawun da za ku iya zama.
We'd better hope she doesn't think it's us.	Gara mu yi fatan kada ta yi tunanin mu ne.
So why is she worried.	Don haka me yasa ta damu.
I did not think so.	Ban yi tunanin hakan ba.
You do not have any.	Ba ka da wani.
She wants to be here.	Tana son zama a nan.
I was just scared.	Na ji tsoro kawai.
I am not trying to kill you.	Ba ina ƙoƙarin kashe ku ba ne.
They do not like that.	Ba sa son hakan.
I can hear it there to this day.	Zan iya jin shi a can har yau.
It is a place to be seen.	Wuri ne da za a gani.
So far this has been working really well.	Ya zuwa yanzu wannan yana aiki sosai.
Work to know this.	Yi aiki don sanin wannan.
He only knew without knowing why he knew.	Ya sani kawai ba tare da sanin dalilin da ya sa ya sani ba.
Therefore, no one can protect us.	Saboda haka, babu wanda zai iya kare mu.
She doesn't trust us.	Ba ta yarda da mu ba.
We can see the end.	Muna iya ganin karshen.
We are going to die.	Za mu mutu.
They really thought they would be.	Da gaske sun yi tsammanin za su kasance.
They shouldn’t have worked, but they did.	Bai kamata su yi aiki ba, amma sun yi.
I need to go, too.	Ina bukata in tafi, kai ma.
The man is a liar.	Mutumin karya ne.
Here, one should not try to think, one must hear.	A nan, kada mutum yayi ƙoƙari ya yi tunani, dole ne ya ji.
Maybe he doesn't like himself very much.	Wataƙila shi ma baya son kansa sosai.
So alive.	Don haka mai rai.
This is a big mistake.	Wannan babban kuskure ne.
I was afraid people would laugh at me.	Na ji tsoro mutane su yi min dariya.
But it just doesn’t work.	Amma ba kawai aiki ba.
We thought we were doing what we were supposed to do.	Mun dauka muna yin abin da ya kamata mu yi.
Someone is crying.	Wani yana kuka.
This is done three times.	Ana yin hakan sau uku.
That should be the case.	Haka ya kamata ya kasance.
Not much, but little.	Ba yawa, amma kadan.
Maybe she will grow up to love him.	Wataƙila za ta girma ta so shi.
As they did not do for a year.	Kamar yadda ba su yi shekara guda ba.
It was an exciting time.	Lokaci ne mai ban sha'awa.
However, they still lack the essentials of life.	Duk da haka, har yanzu suna rasa ainihin abubuwan rayuwa.
Now come here.	Yanzu zo nan.
I'm not used to this.	Ba na saba kamar wannan ba.
At the same time again.	A irin wannan lokacin kuma.
But that quickly changed.	Amma da sauri hakan ya canza.
I want him to be happy.	Ina son ya yi farin ciki.
Not really for me.	Ba sosai gare ni ba.
You can see what he did to him.	Kuna iya ganin abin da ya yi masa.
Do not drink it.	Kada ku sha shi.
It's cold but delicious.	Yayi sanyi amma dadi.
It should be amazing.	Ya kamata ya zama mai ban mamaki.
No one would be so happy.	Ba wanda zai yi farin ciki haka.
It would be amazing.	Zai zama abin ban mamaki.
No one pretended to eat well, except the children.	Ba wanda ya yi kamar yana cin abinci sosai, sai yara.
I stood close.	Na tsaya kusa.
I just came out.	Na fito kawai.
Now go the other way.	Yanzu ku tafi da sauran hanya.
She took her time to drink slowly.	Ta dauki lokaci ta sha a hankali.
In fact, she could not believe that she had ever seen this.	A gaskiya, ta kasa yarda cewa ba ta taba ganin wannan ba.
Interestingly he eats and sleeps.	Abin sha'awa yana ci yana barci.
Don't tell me.	Kar ku gaya mani.
Tell me about the place.	Faɗa mini game da wurin.
We talked and ate as usual.	Mun sha fada muna cin abinci kamar yadda muka saba.
You always want something funny.	Kullum kuna son abin dariya.
Do that.	Shin hakan.
It's getting closer.	Yana zuwa kusa.
He moved on, almost hitting them.	Ya yi gaba, ya kusa buga su.
We must understand this.	Dole ne mu fahimci wannan.
We love it though.	Muna son shi ko da yake.
You will not come with us.	Ba za ku zo tare da mu ba.
It makes me so.	Yana sa ni haka .
They never get and never will.	Ba su taɓa samun ba kuma ba za su taɓa yi ba.
I will explain it to you once and for all.	Zan sake bayyana muku shi sau ɗaya.
I was set right to do so now.	An sanya ni daidai don yin hakan a yanzu.
They take it for granted.	Suna ɗauka ba daidai ba.
There is no reason for me to feel alive.	Babu wani abu da ya sa na ji da rai.
She could no longer take it.	Ba ta iya ƙara ɗauka ba.
There must be a way out.	Dole ne a sami hanyar fita.
Need will be paid.	Za a biya bukata.
We need to learn to talk to each other.	Muna bukatar mu koyi magana da juna.
I am not everyone and everyone.	Ni ba kowa ba ne kuma kowa.
But time has caught up with us.	Amma lokaci ya kama mu.
I try not to worry.	Ina ƙoƙarin kada in damu.
What did you say?.	Me ka ce?.
Boston entered after a while.	Boston ta shiga bayan wani lokaci.
I heard it.	Na ji shi.
You will tell me somehow.	Za ku gaya mani ko ta yaya.
But we can not go on like this.	Amma ba za mu iya ci gaba a haka ba.
And he did not ask her to come in.	Kuma bai nemi ta zo ta shiga ba.
I just feel sad.	Ina jin bakin ciki kawai.
For everyone to forget it.	Don kowa ya manta da shi.
I grew up to love this place.	Ina girma don son wannan wurin.
Not now, too early.	Ba yanzu ba, da wuri ma.
No one knows exactly what is going on.	Babu wanda ya san ainihin abin da ke faruwa.
The startup is working well, so this must be the problem.	Fara yana aiki da kyau, don haka dole ne wannan shine matsalar.
Now is the time to live and enjoy life.	Yanzu shine lokacin rayuwa da yin abubuwan jin daɗi.
Let's put a dog in it.	Mu saka kare a ciki.
This is no more.	Wannan babu kuma.
In fact, they were here.	A gaskiya ma, sun kasance a nan.
What happened here is not funny.	Abin da ya faru a nan ba abin dariya ba ne.
Such things you know.	Irin waɗannan abubuwan da kuka sani.
She hopes to buy a bigger home.	Tana fatan siyan gida mafi girma.
It may be a year before you get your protection.	Yana iya zama shekara guda kafin ku sami kare ku.
We should stay together, remember?	Ya kamata mu zauna tare, tuna?
She does not need to.	Ba ta bukata.
You will be arrested here with me.	Za a kama ku a nan tare da ni.
I would never do that.	Ba zan taba yin haka ba.
We can neither agree nor disagree.	Ba za mu iya yarda ko rashin yarda ba.
I do not know how to explain how everything worked.	Ban san in bayyana yadda komai ya yi aiki ba.
After she was killed she cried.	Bayan an kashe ta sai ta yi kuka.
Something will go wrong.	Wani abu zai yi kuskure.
Talk to others about your problem.	Yi magana da wasu game da matsalar ku.
This only adds to the problem.	Wannan kawai yana ƙara wa matsala.
He could never prove himself.	Bai taba iya tabbatar da kansa ba.
She used to decide something.	Ta kasance tana yanke shawarar wani abu.
We don't have the time or place for that, though.	Ba mu da lokaci ko wuri don haka, ko da yake.
If he enters the road.	Idan ya shiga hanya.
It is a beautiful place.	Wuri ne mai kyau.
In the unknown.	A cikin wanda ba a sani ba.
This will not be done in one day.	Ba za a yi wannan a rana ɗaya ba.
Maybe they are happy.	Wataƙila suna farin ciki.
Maybe this is the cause of the problem.	Wataƙila wannan shine dalilin matsalar.
But you would not want to do that.	Amma ba za ku so ku yi wannan ba.
They talked about rain, about fish.	Sun yi magana game da ruwan sama, game da kifi.
We must start quickly.	Dole ne mu fara da sauri.
This thing that we have, is temporary.	Wannan abu da muke da shi, na ɗan lokaci ne.
No, we can't get up.	A'a, ba za mu iya tashi ba.
Last.	A ƙarshe.
It rained all day and all morning.	A ranar ne aka yi ruwan sama duk da safe.
Everyone knew that, and everyone knew it at the time.	Kowa ya san haka, kuma kowa ya san shi a lokacin.
I have nothing to do.	Ba ni da abin da zan yi.
You can be your best.	Kuna iya zama mafi kyawun ku.
If you are thinking of something, please call me.	Idan kuna tunanin wani abu, don Allah a kira ni.
However, sometimes it does.	Duk da haka, wani lokacin yana yi.
Do this twice a day.	Yi haka sau biyu a rana.
At first it looked good.	Da farko ya yi kama da kyau.
This is something we have.	Wannan wani abu ne da muke da shi.
It seems to be on the way.	Da alama yana kan hanya.
I haven't done it yet.	Ban yi shi ba tukuna.
I would hate to lose it.	Zan ƙi in rasa shi.
It's not much.	Ba ta da yawa.
But for a while.	Amma na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
I have this.	Ina da wannan.
We work together, and we continue to eat.	Muna aiki tare, kuma muna ci gaba da ci.
What we lost, we lost together.	Abin da muka rasa, mun rasa tare.
The same goes for everyone.	Haka kuma ga kowa da kowa.
Sometimes we were on the wrong side when we first went out.	Wani lokaci mun kasance a kan kuskure lokacin da muka fara fita.
That would be nice.	Da yayi kyau.
He comes and goes as he pleases.	Yana zuwa ya tafi yadda ya ga dama.
And we.	Kuma mu.
Yet they are here.	Duk da haka suna nan.
This time is over.	Wannan lokacin ya cika.
Yet we, the people, can make amends.	Amma duk da haka mu, mutane, za mu iya yin gyara.
You can not say anything.	Ba za ku iya cewa komai ba.
Here's how it works.	Ga yadda yake aiki.
In the end, they do.	A ƙarshe, suna yi.
It sold out completely, it has.	An sayar da shi gaba daya, yana da.
He doesn't seem to have enough to fight.	Da alama ba shi da ciki don fada.
It's not a game.	Ba wasa ba ne.
Since then.	Tun daga wannan lokacin.
It will not stop.	Ba zai tsaya ba.
That is what has already happened.	Abin da ya riga ya faru ke nan.
And there is more trouble.	Kuma akwai ƙarin matsala.
Times have changed.	Lokaci ya canza.
They may love it to hear it.	Suna iya son shi don jin shi.
Sometimes they are really scary.	Wani lokaci sun kasance masu ban tsoro da gaske.
The ground stopped.	Kasa ta tsaya.
The rest are still dead now.	Har yanzu sauran sun mutu yanzu.
It makes us suffer.	Yana sa mu wahala.
I spent a year there.	Na yi shekara guda a can.
I tried to turn it on slowly.	Na yi ƙoƙarin kunna shi a hankali.
He didn't even hear.	Bai ma ji ba.
Go there.	Can ku tafi.
It is a feeling for each other.	Ji na juna ne.
No, even more so now.	A'a, har ma fiye da haka yanzu.
You can not go out tonight.	Ba za ku iya fita yau da dare ba.
But he gets more than he eats.	Amma yana samun fiye da yadda yake ci.
We need to do something.	Muna bukatar mu yi wani abu.
We will do the same for years.	Haka kuma za mu yi shekaru.
This is the most popular beverage.	Wannan shine abin sha da aka fi sani.
No one left.	Babu wanda ya bari.
For more information, see it here.	Don ƙarin sani, duba shi nan.
That's it.	Shi ke nan har ya kai ga.
Money is an amazing tool.	Kudi kayan aiki ne mai ban mamaki.
If you want to work, you work.	Idan kuna son yin aiki, kuna aiki.
This is a rare occurrence.	Wannan abu da wuya ya faru.
Nothing they keep talking about.	Ba komai suka ci gaba da magana.
I want to save money now.	Ina son ajiye kudi yanzu.
I'm late, as usual.	Na makara, kamar yadda na saba.
I can accept that.	Zan iya yarda da hakan.
No soul is on the road.	Babu wani rai da ke kan hanya.
They should not sleep together.	Kada su kwana tare.
I will talk to you.	Zan yi magana da ku.
This is the place of weakness.	Wannan shi ne wurin rauni.
If there is no name, no name is required.	Idan babu suna, ba a buƙatar suna.
You can hear but you can not see.	Kuna iya ji amma ba za ku iya gani ba.
It made her want more.	Ya sa ta kara so.
I am here to drink.	Ina nan in sha.
You will want to have these things.	Za ku so ku sami waɗannan abubuwan.
Do not fall on your knees.	Kar ku yi kasa a gwiwa.
Now let's get back to you.	Yanzu bari mu dawo gare ku.
There is only one problem.	Akwai matsala daya kawai.
But it is certainly true.	Amma tabbas mai gaskiya ne.
It will be amazing to see what she does next.	Zai zama abin mamaki don ganin abin da za ta yi a gaba.
But this is a good kind of waiting.	Amma wannan kyakkyawan irin jira ne.
We need to make sure that this does not happen again.	Muna bukatar mu tabbatar da hakan ba zai sake faruwa ba.
He went completely.	Ya tafi gaba daya.
I was there to be third.	Na kasance a can don zama na uku.
I'm looking down.	Ina kallon kasa.
I like these things.	Ina son irin waɗannan abubuwa.
Repeat is not necessary.	Sake yi ba lallai ba ne.
He still hasn’t played with some kids.	Har yanzu bai yi wasa da wasu yara ba.
Some are dead.	Wasu sun mutu.
Many people entered the house.	Mutane da dama ne suka shiga gidan.
The kind of story that looks like real life.	Irin labarin da yayi kama da rayuwa ta gaske.
And we are not there.	Kuma ba mu can.
I will never accept that.	Ba zan taba yarda da hakan ba.
You need to work now.	Kuna buƙatar yin aiki yanzu.
It is true the time has come.	Gaskiya ne lokacin ya tashi.
It really happened.	Ya faru da gaske.
Let him be there and hear it.	Bari ya kasance a can kuma ku ji shi.
Of course it is good to be.	Tabbas yana da kyau su kasance.
It was the first time she had come there.	Shi ne karo na farko da ta zo wurin.
You have two problems.	Kuna da matsala biyu.
I feel good about you and not me.	Na ji dadi da kai ne ba ni ba.
Still, he did not give up.	Amma duk da haka, bai daina ba.
But otherwise he speaks.	Amma in ba haka ba sai ya yi magana.
There is good hope.	Akwai kyakkyawan fata.
He said it was metal.	Yace karfe ne.
So talk.	Don haka magana.
It is a great skin care product.	Yana da babban kayan kula da fata.
He made a mistake.	Yayi kuskure.
I will meet you.	Zan hadu da ku.
How do you sleep?	Yaya kuke barci?
It's too close.	Yana kusa da kusa.
There was less than yesterday.	Akwai kasa da jiya.
She is not well.	Ba ta da lafiya.
He is a man.	Mutum ne.
You'll be sorry for mine.	Za ku yi hakuri da nawa.
It will be so, he assured himself.	Haka za ta kasance, ya tabbatar wa kansa.
They have nothing to change.	Ba su da abin da za su canza.
However it still did not work.	Duk da haka har yanzu bai yi aiki ba.
No wonder she lost her temper.	Ba mamaki ta bata rai.
An excitement rose around them.	Wani farin ciki ya tashi a kusa da su.
She was very optimistic!	Ta kasance mai kyakkyawan fata!
It is difficult to imagine that now.	Yana da wuya a yi tunanin hakan a yanzu.
You or he may get a job.	Kai ko shi yana iya samun aiki.
We are not afraid.	Ba mu da tsoro.
She thought he was wrong.	Ta dauka cewa yayi kuskure.
And it grew fast.	Kuma ya girma da sauri.
They get to know each other better.	Suna sake sanin juna.
Of course he is not here.	Tabbas ba ya nan.
From everyone, you all.	Daga kowa, ku duka.
This is what she looks like.	Wannan shi ne abin da ta kama.
Previously used title.	A baya an yi amfani da take.
I will not let him do this.	Ba zan bar shi yayi wannan ba.
For a while nothing was said.	Na dan wani lokaci ba a cewa komai.
And maybe there is still someone.	Kuma watakila har yanzu akwai mutum.
Let's see how.	Bari mu ga yadda.
They are dead.	Sun mutu.
You did everything.	Kun yi komai.
And maybe it is.	Kuma watakila shi ne.
The restaurant is closed.	An rufe gidan abincin.
You are not alone in this.	Ba kai kadai bane a cikin wannan.
Work, work.	Yi aikin, yi aiki.
I know you came.	Na san ka zo.
It is the work of two men.	Aikin mutum biyu ne.
The landlord didn't care.	Mai gida bai kula ba.
Of course I can see that happening.	Tabbas zan iya ganin hakan yana faruwa.
They came back, but things did not go well.	Sun dawo, amma abubuwa ba su yi kyau ba.
Not on what will happen to her after she finishes.	Ba a kan abin da zai faru da shi bayan ta gama.
I have no money.	Ba ni da kuɗi.
Do not edit.	Kar a gyara.
I always spend the night there.	Kullum ina kwana a wurin.
Why do they eat so much?	Me yasa suke cin abinci da yawa?
I know he knows.	Na san cewa ya sani.
He knows we don't have that.	Ya san ba mu da wannan.
You should do something with it. 	Ya kamata ku yi wani abu da shi. 
Are you working today?	yau kuna aiki?.
Now he's gone.	Yanzu ya tafi.
They looked closer.	Suka duba kusa.
This school has a good reputation.	Wannan makaranta tana da kyakkyawan suna.
Wait, we have to get this right.	Jira, dole ne mu sami wannan daidai.
It has nothing to do with it.	Ba shi da abin cewa a kai.
And he knows her well.	Kuma ya san ta sosai.
I will still feel cold.	Har yanzu zan ji sanyi.
I made a mistake.	Na ba da labarin kuskure.
But we need to go back and think carefully.	Amma muna bukatar mu koma baya mu yi tunani da kyau.
I tried to make them stop.	Na yi ƙoƙari in sa su daina.
I want to prove what it is.	Ina so in tabbatar da abin da yake.
I would like to see that.	Ina son ganin haka.
But that has changed.	Amma ya canza.
Children have to go to school.	Yara dole su je makaranta.
And protect me.	Kuma kare ni.
Everything says.	Komai yace.
It was painful for us.	Ya kasance mai zafi a gare mu.
She drank water every day.	Kullum sai ta sha ruwa.
Somehow she came out.	Ko ta yaya ta fita.
He never sought to save her.	Bai taba neman ya ajiye ta ba.
He said.	Ya fad'a.
I did not answer.	ban amsa ba.
We will be better off.	Za mu fi kyau.
I hope you find this book interesting.	Ina tsammanin za ku sami wannan littafin mai ban sha'awa.
I will go tomorrow.	Zan tafi gaba gobe.
So they came up with everything.	Don haka suka zo da komai.
Let him call the game.	Bari ya kira wasan.
This work is being continued.	Ana ci gaba da wannan aikin.
The train left the station.	Jirgin kasa ya bar tashar.
We will not let that happen.	Ba za mu bar hakan ta faru ba.
I really want a home, I found one.	Ina son gida na gaske, na sami ɗaya.
After all, life was simple.	Bayan haka, rayuwa ta kasance mai sauƙi.
All right now.	Duk yanzu.
I have been thinking about this for a long time.	Na dade ina tunanin hakan.
I will not complain about this.	Ba zan yi kuka a kan wannan ba.
He would not look at anything.	Ba zai kalli wani abu ba.
.	.
It does not taste very good.	Ba shi da daɗi sosai.
Watch them.	Kallon su.
I should be back.	Ya kamata in dawo.
And love it with all.	Kuma son shi da duka.
He reads day and night.	Yana karatu dare da rana.
I don't look at anything.	Ba ina kallon komai ba.
But that doesn't seem to be the case right now.	Amma ba ko da hakan zai yi kyau sosai a yanzu.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane.
We returned to this house on the way.	Muka koma gidan nan ta hanya.
It can't rain very much.	Ba zai iya yin ruwan sama da yawa ba.
You are ready.	Kun shirya.
That's why we know people.	Wannan shi ya sa muke sanin mutane.
I know this is true.	Na san cewa wannan gaskiya ne.
He told me.	Yace min .
This statement is true.	Wannan magana gaskiya ce.
We can be that.	Za mu iya zama haka.
This is for sure.	Wannan tabbas tabbas.
Kill yourself!	Kashe kai!
He tried to explain the strange things.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya bayyana abubuwan ban mamaki.
If you look at this ship it is amazing.	Idan ka kalli wannan jirgin yana da ban mamaki.
Would you please go outside?	Don Allah za a iya fita waje?
He looked, and saw nothing.	Ya duba, bai ga komai ba.
You need one.	Kuna buƙatar ɗaya.
She closed the door.	Ta rufe kofar.
How can you let her do that? '	Ta yaya za ku bar ta ta yi haka?'.
Before that they did not exist.	Kafin haka babu su.
They are not paid.	Ba a biya su ba.
This is not something like that.	Wannan ba wani abu bane kamar haka.
Not for eating, of course.	Ba don cin abinci ba, ba shakka.
The night is hard.	Dare yayi wuya.
All from girls.	Duk daga 'yan mata.
We must think so.	Dole ne mu yi tunani a haka.
I just started.	Na fara kawai.
He could not help himself.	Ba zai iya taimakon kansa ba.
At that time now.	A wannan lokacin a yanzu.
Nothing was sent.	Ba a aika da komai ba.
Now it is true.	Yanzu gaskiya ne.
We haven't had a drink since.	Tun daga nan ba mu sha ba.
For me, this is the best kind of surprise there is.	A gare ni, wannan shine mafi kyawun irin abin mamaki da akwai.
But it certainly is.	Amma tabbas yana da.
One, and she arrives now.	Daya, kuma ta isa yanzu.
She was alive.	Ta kasance mai rai.
It is completely absent.	Ba shi da gaba daya.
Every day, they get a little better.	Kowace rana, suna samun ɗan kyau.
He stayed right.	Ya zauna daidai.
We have no food, so we cannot give you food.	Ba mu da abinci, don haka ba za mu iya ba ku abinci ba.
If you want to see the world, go for it.	Idan kana son ganin duniya, yi tafiya.
Do whatever they want.	Yin duk abin da suke so.
You can not put me.	Ba za ku iya sa ni ba.
I want you to think about it.	Ina so ku yi tunani game da shi.
This in itself is not surprising.	Shi kansa wannan ba abin mamaki ba ne.
He was not interested.	Bai yi sha'awar ba.
Something like that.	Wani abu kamar haka.
They say they don't.	Suka ce ba su da.
And watch it come back to you.	Kuma ku duba ya dawo gare ku.
Really love it.	Da gaske son shi.
The seating work was very interesting.	Aikin wurin zama ya kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
He wanted to change that.	Ya so ya canza hakan.
Two things prove this.	Abubuwa biyu ne suka tabbatar da hakan.
It can be proven easily.	Ana iya tabbatar da sauƙi.
He divorced her, and she did.	Ya sake ta da ita, kuma ta yi kyau.
But you will still cry.	Amma har yanzu za ku yi kuka.
We never said that, the two of us.	Ba mu taba yin magana haka ba, mu biyu.
Do not do anything or try to make it go away.	Kada ku yi wani abu ko ƙoƙarin sa ya tafi.
It's a way of making people laugh.	Yana da hanyar sa mutane dariya.
He let us in.	Sai ya bar mu mu shiga.
Please, just give them all the money you can.	Don Allah, kawai ku ba su duk kuɗin da za ku iya.
He just remembered her.	Ya dan tuna da ita.
Now we can't.	Yanzu ba za mu iya ba.
When he got home.	Lokacin da ya isa gida.
I know you, now.	Na san ku, yanzu.
So we waited more.	Don haka muka kara jira.
And that did not help him much.	Kuma hakan bai taimaka masa ba sosai.
And he does not smoke.	Kuma baya shan taba.
They think they are sick.	Suna ganin ba su da lafiya.
Please can anyone help me to get this.	Don Allah kowa zai iya taimaka min don samun wannan.
We are accustomed to this.	Mun saba da wannan.
We know them.	Mun san su ne.
To keep hearing and acting.	Don ci gaba ka ji kuma ka yi aiki.
Nothing is enough.	Babu abin da ya isa.
I'm not even sure we know what that is.	Ban tabbata ma mun san menene hakan ba.
I can't understand the problem.	Ba zan iya gane matsalar ba.
There’s something weird about that, he thought.	Akwai wani abu mai ban mamaki game da wannan, ya yi tunani.
If he were.	Idan ya kasance.
And it works really well.	Kuma yana aiki sosai.
We need to work.	Muna bukatar mu yi aiki.
I went there.	Na tafi can.
Whether or not she wants the time of day.	Ko ba lokacin rana take so ba.
What do you want to ask me?	Me kuke so ku tambaye ni?
I hope it works well for you too.	Ina fatan ya yi muku kyau kuma.
Have you read this book?	Shin kun karanta wannan littafin?
If he puts himself down.	Idan ya ajiye kansa kasa.
We did not do these things or think much of them.	Ba mu yi waɗannan abubuwan ba ko kuma mu yi tunanin su da yawa.
But if you know best you should try to do your best.	Amma idan kun san mafi kyau ku yi ƙoƙarin yin mafi kyau.
I am a local.	Ni ɗan gida ne.
No problem.	Ba matsala.
I usually trust you.	Na saba yarda da ku.
Now check it out.	Yanzu lafiya a duba ta.
Well, we have a few of these too.	Yayi kyau, muna da kaɗan daga cikin waɗannan ma.
Think of all the things you can do.	Ka yi tunanin duk abubuwan da za ka iya yi.
Like, more like, like.	Kamar, fiye da so, kamar.
She sure does.	Ta tabbata ya yi.
It's somewhere nearby.	Yana wani wuri kusa.
It still needs some work.	Har yanzu yana buƙatar wani aiki.
I love you more than life.	Ina son ku fiye da rayuwa.
Not really running.	Ba gaske gudu ba.
This should not come as a surprise.	Wannan bai kamata ya zo da mamaki ba.
The first thing is to finish early.	Abu na daya shine ya kare da wuri.
You need more and more to get that feeling.	Kuna buƙatar ƙara don samun wannan jin daɗi kuma.
Something unseen is yet to come.	Wani abu da ba wanda ya gani yana zuwa.
And this is a little weird.	Kuma wannan ɗan ban mamaki ne.
Food is known here all over the world.	An san abinci a nan a duk duniya.
It is common.	Na kowa ne.
Do three.	Yi uku.
I can't today.	Ba zan iya yau ba.
He will get a good job.	Zai sami aiki mai kyau.
One person died.	Mutum daya ya mutu.
I was the last one.	Ni ne na ƙarshe.
It just so happens that it is difficult.	Haka kawai ya faru cewa yana da wuya.
She is beautiful and fast.	Tana da kyau da sauri.
It doesn't work for me.	Ba ya aiki a gare ni.
It has to be good.	Dole ne yayi kyau.
I do not even know what.	Ban ma san menene ba.
Everyone says so.	Kowa yace haka.
Before you were together, he saw no reason to tell you.	Kafin ku kasance tare, bai ga dalilin gaya muku ba.
Have a nice weekend.	A yi kyakkyawan karshen mako.
Now the run is over.	Yanzu gudu ya kare.
It does not seem to exist now.	Da alama babu shi yanzu.
No one was done.	Babu wanda aka yi.
I get that all together.	Ina samun hakan gaba ɗaya.
In this, perhaps, you are like other people.	A cikin wannan, watakila, kuna kamar sauran mutane.
We need you.	Muna bukatar ku.
We do it because it is necessary.	Muna yin hakan ne saboda dole ne.
It will only take a day or two.	Zai ɗauki su kwana ɗaya ko biyu kawai.
I did it because it was work.	Na yi shi ne saboda aiki ne.
You can do this again.	Kuna iya yin wannan kuma.
But it is not good to lie to children.	Amma ba kyau a yi wa yara karya.
They want to upset him.	Suna so su bata masa rai.
It will never be the same.	Ba zai taɓa zama ɗaya ba.
He will do it.	Zai yi shi.
Not much though.	Ba yawa ko da yake.
I was in the past.	Na kasance a baya.
They will tell you what cannot be done and why.	Za su gaya muku abin da ba za a iya yi ba kuma me ya sa.
I will kill you now.	Zan kashe ka yanzu.
I have a story to tell you.	Ina da labarin da zan ba ku.
She took the time to come.	Ta dauki lokaci tana zuwa.
And he will never leave you.	Kuma ba zai taɓa barin ku da gaske ba.
We need some things.	Muna bukatar wasu abubuwa.
There is no place to go from there.	Babu wani wuri da za mu je daga can.
They just came and went.	Sai kawai suka zo suka tafi.
That is why he failed.	Shi ya sa ya kasa.
And, of course some are walking.	Kuma, ba shakka wasu suna tafiya.
So what you do is you think of someone else.	Don haka abin da kuke yi shine kuna tunanin wani.
I do not feel my age.	Ban ji shekaru na ba.
That is the story.	Wannan shine labarin.
He suggested that we start the weekend early.	Ya ba da shawarar cewa mu fara karshen mako da wuri.
You have to work with everyone.	Dole ne ku yi aiki tare da kowa.
It just didn't seem right.	Kamar bai kusan isa ba.
This is a great way to watch it.	Wannan hanya ce mai kyau don kallon ta.
I really want to do more in the future.	Lallai ina son in kara yin komai a nan gaba.
Now we run, move on to progress.	Yanzu muna gudu, ci gaba don ci gaba.
You have been on this path for a long time.	Kun dade akan wannan hanya.
That does not happen.	Hakan baya faruwa.
He had to go back inside.	Sai da ya koma ciki.
We know what it takes to do things.	Mun san abin da ake bukata don yin abubuwa.
That maybe they will just grow up.	Cewa wataƙila za su girma ne kawai.
Please hurry up.	Da fatan za a yi sauri.
This is the kind of person.	Wannan shi ne irin mutumin.
I hated it because of it.	Na ƙi shi saboda wannan.
He studied hard.	Yayi karatu sosai.
I will only change this dress.	Zan canza wannan rigar kawai.
This restaurant has a reputation for good food.	Wannan gidan cin abinci yana da suna don abinci mai kyau.
I think they made a mistake.	Ina tsammanin sun yi kuskure.
You do not agree.	Kun yarda ba.
Will they be sold?	Shin za a sayar da su?
He no longer knew.	Bai kara sani ba.
She will be human again.	Za ta sake zama mutum.
This is where the road dies.	Wannan a nan ɗan hanyar ya mutu.
I have to go.	Dole ne in tafi.
It looks like she's going to sleep tonight.	Da alama ko zata kwana a daren nan.
It feels really good.	Yana jin dadi sosai.
Go ahead, please.	Ci gaba, don Allah.
It is the same.	Guda daya ne.
He could not tell him.	Ya kasa gaya masa.
The thought bothered him.	Tunanin ya bata masa rai.
I like the way I look now, inside and out.	Ina son yadda na yanzu yake kama, ciki da waje.
They feel like one thing, but in reality they are not.	Suna jin kamar abu ɗaya, amma a gaskiya ba haka suke ba.
I gave the game.	Na ba da wasan.
She can't get it.	Ba za ta iya samu ba.
He could not begin to think what to say.	Ya kasa fara tunanin me zai ce.
It would be better for her to go.	Zai fi kyau ta tafi.
I'm not trying to say you can't go out.	Ba ina ƙoƙarin cewa ba za ku iya fita ba.
Let's go back to the front.	Mu koma baya zuwa gaba.
And what someone else needs.	Kuma abin da wani yake bukata.
I would like your advice later, of course.	Zan so shawarar ku daga baya, babu shakka.
He is a wonderful man.	Mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
Not found any.	Ba gano ko ɗaya ba.
And not much if you can.	Kuma ba yawa idan za ku iya.
This is a matter of thought.	Wannan magana ce ta tunani.
I'm just a cool guy.	Ni mutum ne kawai mai sanyi.
So it is good there is something useful for me.	Don haka yana da kyau akwai abin amfani a gare ni.
I am now.	Ni ne a yanzu.
Whose is this?	Na wane ne wannan?
He motioned for her.	Ya nuna mata da hannu.
They felt good.	Sun ji dadi.
Would you show me where it is?	Za a iya nuna mani inda yake?
He was not afraid.	Bai ji tsoro ba.
I can't live without you.	Ba zan iya rayuwa ba tare da ku ba.
I want that to be surprising.	Ina son hakan ya zama abin mamaki.
You do them.	Kuna yin su.
You can not go out again.	Ba za ku iya sake fita ba.
Don't like this place?	Ba ku son wannan wurin?
I just want to show that.	Ina so ne kawai in nuna hakan.
He will be in everything.	Shi ne zai kasance a cikin komai.
She gave it to him.	Ta ba shi.
Wrong enough to cover right.	Ba daidai ba ya isa ya rufe dama.
As it came, the heat went away.	Kamar yadda ya zo, zafi ya tafi.
The work is great for him.	Aikin yana da girma a gare shi.
Now, let me explain what happened next.	Yanzu, bari in bayyana abin da ya faru a gaba.
Talk to each other.	Magana da juna.
He hates them.	Ya ƙi su.
That would not be good.	Wannan ba zai yi kyau ba.
Don't keep talking.	Kar a ci gaba da magana.
None were ever sent.	Ba a taɓa aika ko ɗaya ba.
This is the essence of it.	Wannan shi ne ainihin shi.
They show me everything, but tell me everything.	Suna nuna mani komai, amma ku gaya mani komai.
Not sure, though.	Ban tabbata ba, duk da haka.
No one even knows.	Ba wanda ita ma bata sani ba.
It could happen again.	Yana iya sake faruwa.
There is always something he can do.	Koyaushe akwai wani abu da zai iya yi.
Let's try this together and see what happens.	Bari mu gwada wannan tare mu ga abin da ya faru.
He has a lot of work to do.	Yana da aiki da yawa da zai yi.
It is not so anymore.	Ba ta zama haka ba kuma.
Only the truth is here.	Gaskiya kawai tana nan.
That's what she thought.	Abin da ta zata kenan.
Rewrite it, fine.	A sake rubuta shi, da kyau.
Some do not.	Wasu ba sa.
That is now.	Wannan shine yanzu.
She hopes it will not be too late.	Ta yi fatan kar a makara haka.
He can find himself.	Zai iya neman kansa.
Just buy.	Kawai saya.
Do what they say.	Yi abin da suka ce.
But we can't.	Amma ba mu iya ba.
I want to see the world.	Ina son ganin duniya.
You talk like a child.	Kuna magana kamar yaro.
I will say that again.	Zan sake cewa.
He was the first to arrive.	Shi ne ya fara zuwa wurin taron.
Now three months.	Yanzu wata uku.
If you are.	Idan kun kasance.
It is now the world.	Yanzu duniya ce.
You are not walking away from this.	Ba kuna tafiya daga wannan ba.
However, he did not feel the need to show it to her.	Duk da haka, bai ji bukatar ya nuna mata hakan ba.
There is work to be done.	Akwai aiki.
Otherwise, he will eventually kill her.	Idan ba haka ba, a ƙarshe zai kashe ta.
They will be applied to other uses.	Za a yi amfani da su zuwa wasu amfani.
My man.	Mutumin nawa .
In fact, it's too much.	A gaskiya ma, yana da ma da yawa.
Really like.	Da gaske so.
It can't happen.	Ba zai iya faruwa ba.
There is something amazing about what she does.	Akwai wani abu mai ban mamaki game da abin da take yi.
There is nothing they can do.	Babu abin da za su iya yi.
Or eat it.	Ko kuma ku ci shi.
Stopped, could not walk together.	An tsaya, an kasa tafiya tare.
No one.	Babu wani.
Everyone wanted to catch her.	Kowa ya so a kama ta.
I'm not feeling well.	Ba ni da lafiya.
There seems to be some truth in the allegations.	Da alama akwai gaskiya a cikin zargin.
We just played.	Mun yi wasa kawai.
It happened.	Haka ya faru.
I have never seen this.	Ban taba ganin wannan ba.
It looks so good.	Ya yi kyau sosai.
There is plenty of water here.	Akwai ruwa mai yawa a nan.
And he was right.	Kuma yayi gaskiya.
All you can be is you.	Duk abin da za ku iya zama shine ku.
I cried.	Na yi kuka.
Of course I would like to sit down again and recommend it to everyone.	Tabbas zan so in sake zama kuma in ba da shawarar ga kowa.
When that happens, it may need to continue.	Lokacin da hakan ya faru, yana iya buƙatar ci gaba.
We feed the dogs.	Muna ba da abinci ga kare.
The one who did not run.	Wanda bai gudu ba.
But he did not.	Amma bai yi ba.
The world is a big place.	Duniya babban wuri ne.
These are.	Waɗannan su ne.
Who knows, maybe they will.	Wanene ya sani, watakila za su yi.
They are not healthy or weak.	Ba su da lafiya ko rauni.
I'm not sure about that.	Ban tabbata akan hakan ba.
She loves home.	Ta so gida.
However, he did.	Duk da haka, ya yi.
He just spoke.	Ya dan yi magana.
Not used.	Ba a amfani.
Every day is one day.	Kowace rana ɗaya ce.
You’re just doing your job.	Kuna yin aikin ku kawai.
Whoever does.	Wanda yayi.
With that in mind, he wondered if he really wanted to move on.	Akan wannan tunanin, ya yi tunanin ko da gaske yana son ci gaba.
So it takes time.	Don haka yana ɗaukar lokaci.
You should leave me.	Ya kamata ku bar ni.
But there is not much time for that.	Amma babu lokaci mai yawa don haka.
Will work here.	Za a yi aiki a nan.
I looked ahead, I saw nothing.	Na duba gaba, ban ga komai ba.
Don't ask me how.	Kar ka tambaye ni yaya.
And it may be better.	Kuma yana iya zama mafi kyau.
It is the largest ship ever built.	Ita ce jirgin ruwa mafi girma da aka taɓa yi.
I will tell you something.	Zan gaya muku wani abu.
Much in fact.	Da yawa a gaskiya.
She felt she loved them.	Ta ji tana son su.
Really, really good.	Gaskiya, da kyau sosai.
I will open it for you.	Zan bude muku shi.
Sometimes you kill her.	Wani lokaci ka kashe ta.
And they seem to be getting bigger.	Kuma da alama suna ƙara girma.
I would not have expected anything.	Da ban yi tsammanin komai ba.
I want to cry, not laugh.	Ina so in yi kuka, ba dariya ba.
They knew it was a lie.	Sun san cewa karya ce.
I am very beautiful.	Ina da kyau sosai.
I can not look up.	Ba zan iya kallon sama ba.
I have something to do.	Ina da abin yi.
They are interested.	Suna sha'awar .
I said no, too.	Na ce a'a, kuma.
You can try that.	Kuna iya gwada hakan.
Likewise.	Haka kuma.
She does now.	Ta yi yanzu.
Then one day it changed.	Sai wata rana ya canza.
Growth is good.	Girma yana da kyau.
I will now continue to work.	Na yanzu zai ci gaba da aiki.
That's what they think.	Abin da suke tunani ke nan.
She could not get out.	Ta kasa fita.
The man said he was not feeling well.	Mutumin ya ce bai ji dadi ba.
I'm sure they will be some of that.	Na tabbata za su zama wasu daga cikin wannan.
She made me show my wife.	Ta sa na nuna mata nawa.
He was amazed at how much he changed.	Ya yi mamakin yadda ya canza.
Don't let that bother you.	Kada wannan ya damu ku.
I can't get enough.	Ba zan iya isa ba.
Can you answer that?	Za ku iya amsa wannan?
And it certainly is nothing.	Kuma tabbas ba komai ba ne.
Or it appears they are doing it.	Ko kuma ya bayyana suna yi.
He will be amazed at this work.	Zai yi mamaki a wannan aikin.
What should we do? 	Me ya kamata mu yi?
I hope no one is hurt.	Ina fatan babu wanda ya ji rauni.
It is not that simple.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi haka ba.
I think we have shown that now.	Ina tsammanin mun nuna hakan yanzu.
They just exist, and they are what they are.	Suna nan kawai, kuma su ne abin da suke.
We're just in it.	Mu kawai a ciki.
It was like a game.	Ya kasance kamar wasa.
This has been done very well.	An yi haka sosai.
We never really looked at anything.	Ba mu taɓa kallon wani abu da gaske ba.
I can't add.	Ba zan iya ƙara ba.
It's a real problem.	Matsala ce ta gaske.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Ban tabbata menene matsalar ba.
He usually works at home.	Yana yawan aiki a gida.
Very happy to recommend.	Mai matukar farin ciki sosai shawarar.
It is a place we like.	Wuri ne da muke so.
On the second day.	A rana ta biyu.
Nothing goes in, nothing goes out.	Babu abin da ke shiga, babu abin da ke fita.
If you read, read.	Idan ka karanta, karanta.
That is why it is still there.	Shi yasa har yanzu yana nan.
This is not fair.	Wannan bai dace ba.
I love all of these things, too.	Ina son duka waɗannan abubuwan, kuma.
Remove from heat and set aside.	Cire daga zafi kuma ajiye.
I'm fine, honestly.	Ina lafiya, gaskiya.
So she got up with me.	Don haka ta tashi da ni.
It is going to rain.	Da alama za a yi ruwan sama.
There is no sitting time.	Babu lokacin zama.
I worked it all out.	Na yi aiki duka.
She cried again.	Kuka ta sake yi.
Be very careful.	Yi hankali da hankali sosai.
If they can be found.	Idan ana iya samun su.
I don't know how she will do it.	Ban san yadda za ta yi ba.
Not time to talk.	Ba lokacin magana ba.
No one will believe us if we act like this.	Babu wanda zai yarda da mu idan muka yi aiki haka.
You probably won't mind.	Wataƙila ba za ku damu ba.
It is easy to see why.	Yana da sauƙi a ga dalilin da ya sa.
It brings many things that have never been seen before.	Yana kawo abubuwa da yawa da ba a taɓa gani ba.
The book was very interesting and very interesting.	Littafin ya kasance mai ban sha'awa kuma yana da sha'awa sosai.
This man did not hate her.	Wannan mutumin bai ƙi ta ba.
They look scared.	Kallon tsoro suka yi.

And kind of cold.	Kuma irin sanyi.
There will be more to come.	Za a sami ƙarin zuwa.
I just care about everyone.	Ina kula da kowa ne kawai.
We went on a boat one day.	Mun tafi jirgin ruwa wata rana.
Things are going well.	Abubuwa suna tafiya lafiya.
Do not tell anyone that.	Kar ka gaya wa kowa haka.
As something goes there is only happiness.	Kamar yadda wani abu ya bayyana akwai farin ciki kawai.
They did not know he was there.	Ba su san yana nan ba.
And he made a mistake.	Kuma ya yi kuskure.
Continue to suffer in the world.	Ci gaba da shan wahala a duniya.
Above and beyond.	Sama da sama.
Unemployment is rampant here.	Rashin aikin yi ya zama ruwan dare a nan.
Please just try not to get up.	Don Allah kawai ku gwada kada ku tashi.
It was so simple.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi haka.
He is like a child.	Shi kamar yaro ne.
It is being detected.	Ana gano shi.
Or maybe not.	Ko watakila ba haka ba ne.
She is the one he needs to protect.	Ita ce ya ke bukata ya kare.
People see what they want to see.	Mutane suna ganin abin da suke so su gani.
He’s weak, though.	Shi mai rauni ne, ko da yake.
It has been so long.	Ya dade haka.
That time is now.	Wannan lokacin shine yanzu.
But that is enough.	Amma hakan ya isa.
He was an honest boy.	Ya kasance yaro mai gaskiya.
This is how much we do.	Wannan shine nawa muka yi.
Here is the catch.	Ga kama.
Work will be everything he does in the game.	Aiki zai zama duk abin da yake yi a wasan.
I have never seen such a beautiful back.	Ban taba ganin kyakkyawan baya irin wannan ba.
And he is only intelligent.	Kuma shi mai hankali ne kawai.
They can break.	Su iya karya.
But they write like it is.	Amma suna rubuta kamar shi ne.
The others are similar.	Sauran suna kama.
He didn't care.	Bai damu ba.
I personally felt that way two years ago.	Ni kaina na ji haka shekaru biyu da suka wuce.
financial crisis.	matsalar kudi.
Of course that's right.	Tabbas hakan yayi daidai.
I know who.	Na san wanene.
Absent.	Ba ya nan.
He feels tired.	Yana jin yadda ya gaji.
It has to be something that kills a lot of people easily.	Dole ne ya zama abin da ya kashe mutane da yawa cikin sauƙi.
He did not agree.	Bai yarda ba.
You can do a lot like you think about it '.	Kuna iya da yawa kamar kuna tunani da shi'.
And that's why.	Kuma wannan ya sa.
I'm doing really well.	Ina yin kyau sosai.
We need to explain right from wrong.	Muna bukatar mu bayyana daidai da kuskure.
No one is dead.	Wani bai mutu ba.
You can't go wrong.	Ba za ku iya yin kuskure ba.
We can not know.	Ba za mu iya sani ba.
I can't catch this.	Ba zan iya kama wannan ba.
No one came.	Babu wanda ya zo.
I want life to take me somewhere.	Ina son rayuwa ta kai ni wani wuri.
But we can talk about it later.	Amma za mu iya magana game da shi daga baya.
I know you did not.	Na san ba ka yi ba.
He had heard all this before.	Ya taba jin wannan duka a baya.
Be very careful!	Yi hankali sosai!
Hope you enjoyed reading this.	Da fatan kun ji daɗin karanta wannan.
Or she may get it.	Ko kuma tana iya samun .
I have never heard or read that.	Ban taba ji ko karanta hakan ba.
That night will be a spectacular one.	Wannan daren zai zama abin ban sha'awa.
We must wait for them.	Dole ne mu jira su.
I have to work really hard on that.	Ya kamata in yi aiki da gaske a kan hakan.
This is sad and scary.	Wannan abin bakin ciki ne da ban tsoro.
It will not be anything new.	Ba zai zama sabon abu ba.
Maybe soon, maybe in a year.	Wataƙila nan da nan, watakila a cikin shekara guda.
He left at the end of the month.	Ya fita a karshen wata.
It worked really well.	An yi aiki sosai.
Nothing of it because we are each other.	Babu wani abu daga cikin shi saboda muna da juna.
He came close.	Ya zo kusa.
I'm sorry.	Na yi hakuri da.
Still not found.	Har yanzu ba a samu ba.
She is an amazing kid.	Yaro ce mai ban mamaki.
Children are growing slowly and rapidly.	Yara suna girma a hankali da sauri.
But no one is doing that.	Amma babu wanda ke yin hakan.
You will know about it little by little.	Za ku san game da shi kadan da kadan.
I think it will work.	Ina tsammanin zai yi aiki.
He could not pass her.	Bai iya wuce ta ba.
And, it is me.	Kuma, ni ne.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
No one stays there anymore.	Ba wanda ya ƙara zama a wurin.
This, as we know, did not happen.	Wannan, kamar yadda muka sani, bai faru ba.
It has a lot to say.	Yana da abubuwa da yawa da za a ce.
She has to change.	Dole ta canza.
I thought about the future.	Na yi tunani game da nan gaba.
I can't put them in place.	Ba zan iya sanya su a wuri ba.
Please tell me what happened.	Don Allah a gaya mani abin da ya faru.
She was already married.	Da ta riga ta yi aure.
Maybe we do, maybe we don’t.	Wataƙila muna yi, watakila ba mu yi ba.
I worked with them, though.	Na yi aiki tare da su, ko da yake.
We are more than that.	Mun fi wannan.
Everyone who has it is there.	Duk wanda ke da kowa yana can.
Such a place.	Irin wannan wurin ne.
It is completely closed.	Ya rufe gaba daya.
But he will not do it.	Amma ba zai yi ba.
Which is how we know what should happen.	Wanda shi ne yadda muka san abin da ya kamata ya faru.
No one wants to think about it.	Ba wanda yake son yin tunani game da shi.
I will stay with you.	Zan zauna tare da ku.
I am thirty years old.	Ina da shekara talatin.
There is no way he was here.	Babu yadda ya kasance a nan.
But he didn't want to talk about it that day.	Amma ba ya son yin magana a kan hakan a ranar.
So much to lose.	Sosai a rasa.
Last night was not good, you know.	A daren jiya bai yi kyau ba, ka sani.
You probably won't get that far.	Wataƙila ba za ku isa wannan ba.
Does anyone know anything?	Akwai wanda ya san wani abu?
I still love her.	Har yanzu ina son ta.
No, we said.	A'a, muka ce.
You can put it back, after that.	Kuna iya saka shi baya, bayan haka.
This shows that it is not safe.	Hakan ya nuna ba lafiya.
I answered however.	Na amsa duk da haka.
You can't expect people to learn things well.	Ba za ku iya tsammanin mutane za su koyi abubuwa da kyau ba.
She did not go back to school.	Bata koma makaranta ba.
And boy, do they.	Kuma yaro, suna yi.
She wanted to smoke.	Ta so ta taba.
That will not happen.	Hakan ba zai faru ba.
You seem to have fixed the problem.	Da alama kun gyara matsalar.
He enjoyed it, really.	Ya ji daɗi, a gaskiya.
The house is open and nice.	Gidan a bude yake kuma yana da kyau.
Immediately she sat down.	Nan take ta zauna.
She passed.	Ta wuce.
I am here for you.	Na zo nan saboda ku.
If you can not pay, you can not get in.	Idan ba za ku iya biya ba, ba za ku iya samun shiga ba.
I did not.	Ban yi ba.
As you do not.	Kamar yadda ba ku yi ba.
I want to fly from there.	Ina so in tashi daga can.
To the big house.	Zuwa babban gida.
But you are almost three years late.	Amma kun kusan shekaru uku sun makara.
That didn't help.	Hakan ya kasa taimaka.
So, she asked me.	Don haka, ta tambaye ni.
No one but the other.	Babu daya sai da sauran.
The money is not mine.	Kuɗin ba nawa ba ne.
It hurts inside.	Ya ji zafi a ciki.
See on it.	Gani akan shi.
I had a wonderful time with you.	Na sami lokaci mai ban sha'awa tare da ku.
Speak the name.	Yi magana da sunan.
So far the weekend has been good already.	Ya zuwa yanzu karshen mako yana da kyau riga.
Sometimes the train is fast, sometimes slow.	Wani lokaci jirgin ya yi sauri, wani lokacin a hankali.
But now you know.	Amma yanzu kun sani.
What more do we need, really.	Me kuma muke bukata, da gaske.
Here is what came.	Ga abin da ya zo.
You wrote everything, didn't you?	Kun rubuta komai, ko ba haka ba?
I do not know what to say to you.	Ban san wani abu da zan gaya muku ba.
Ask them to recognize it.	Ka tambaye su su gane shi.
It was a little weird.	Ya kasance kadan kadan.
You do not have it in you.	Ba ku da shi a cikin ku.
I will go with her.	Zan tafi da ita.
Maybe you bought a lot.	Wataƙila kun sayi da yawa.
They didn't see how bad it was, at first.	Ba su ga yadda hakan ya kasance mummunan abu ba, da farko.
He can talk to people easily.	Zai iya magana da mutane cikin sauƙi.
He has already experienced several setbacks.	Ya riga ya ci karo da koma baya da dama.
Keep coming !.	Ci gaba da zuwa!.
I really enjoyed it.	Na ji daɗi sosai.
We talked about it.	Mun yi magana game da shi.
We love each other.	Mun so juna.
The first step will be to get hot water.	Abu na farko zai kasance a sami ruwan zafi.
Nothing bears fruit without the effort of making progress.	Babu wani abu da ya ba da 'ya'ya ba tare da ƙoƙari na ci gaba ba.
You are a human being.	Kai mutum ne.
Of course there is something she can do to help him.	Tabbas akwai abin da za ta iya yi don taimaka masa.
He is lying.	Karya yake yi.
She looked up.	Ta kalli sama.
He assumes no one knows.	Ya dauka babu wanda ya sani.
You just hated the job.	Kun ƙi aikin kawai.
And the reason why it happens is because of two things.	Kuma dalilin da ya sa hakan ke faruwa saboda abubuwa biyu ne.
And you know, we can't do much with that.	Kuma kun sani, ba za mu iya yin yawa da wannan ba.
They have not yet started working.	Har yanzu ba su fara aiki ba.
He thinks like a man does.	Yana tunani kamar yadda mutum yayi.
Give it a week.	A ba shi mako guda.
With this interest she began to walk.	Da wannan sha'awar ta fara tafiya.
Others said they had lunch.	Wasu kuma sun ce suna cin abincin rana.
They will.	Za su yi.
It does everything we need to do it.	Yana yin duk abin da muke bukata don yin shi.
I did not know that we had ever had the opportunity to do that.	Ban san cewa mun taba samun damar yin hakan ba.
It just doesn't seem to be happening.	Kamar ba da gaske ke faruwa ba.
She wanted it so.	Ta so shi don haka.
It still feels good.	Har yanzu ana jin dadi.
People love it.	Mutane suna son shi.
I have more work to do.	Ina da sauran aikin da zan yi.
But it was difficult.	Amma ya yi wuya.
He did not speak.	Magana bai yi ba.
They protect it.	Suna kare shi.
But it is not.	Amma ba haka ba.
It is difficult to decide what to do with it !.	Yana da wuya a yanke shawarar abin da za a yi aiki a kai!.
By the way always.	Ta irin haka kullum.
It 's worth doing.	Daidai ne a yi.
Here it is.	Ga shi, duba.
I have something to say.	Ina da abin da zan ce.
She does not need to be there.	Ba ta bukatar zama a wurin.
I want to see you.	Ina son ganin ka.
All we have to do is start over.	Abin da ya kamata mu yi shi ne fara sake.
She did not know what to say.	Bata san me take son fada ba.
I have done this for many years.	Na yi haka tsawon shekaru.
I did not say.	Ban fada ba.
It must be enough.	Dole ne ya isa .
We will work with him.	Za mu yi aiki da shi.
Something needs to be done.	Akwai bukatar a yi wani abu.
You will not tell me what to do.	Ba za ku gaya mani abin da zan yi ba.
Surprising, isn’t it?	Abin ban mamaki, ko ba haka ba?
They let us look at the place and where it was prepared for us.	Sun bar mu mu duba da wuri da kuma inda aka shirya mana.
But we all know.	Amma duk mun sani.
I feel very comfortable.	Ina jin dadi sosai.
Then something amazing happened.	Sai wani abu mai ban mamaki ya faru.
It is good for the child.	Yana da kyau ga yaro.
And then it changed.	Kuma a lokacin ne ya canza.
You must take life as it comes.	Dole ne ku ɗauki rai kamar yadda ta zo.
It shows that you are still a human being.	Ya nuna cewa har yanzu kai mutum ne.
Undoubtedly, that these things happened.	Babu shakka, cewa waɗannan abubuwan sun faru.
We failed here.	Mu kasa nan.
You can't wait for someone to do it for you.	Ba za ku iya jira har sai wani ya yi muku.
It must be a great pleasure.	Dole ne ya zama babban abin jin daɗi.
It will not stop.	Ba za ta tsaya ba.
It is a statement of truth.	Magana ce ta gaskiya.
However you do not use it.	Duk da haka ba ku amfani da shi.
There is a slight correction.	Akwai kadan gyara.
It brings trouble.	Yana kawo matsala.
He quickly took her away.	Da sauri ya tafi da ita.
So he met her.	Haka ya hadu da ita.
Use whatever you want and what you can get.	Yi amfani da duk abin da kuke so da abin da za ku iya samu.
Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.	Wani lokaci hakan yana aiki, wani lokacin ba haka bane.
No one ever told me.	Babu wanda ya taba gaya mani.
No one is with him right now.	A nan yanzu babu wanda yake tare da shi.
This is a lie.	Wannan karya ce.
You must be able to do these things.	Dole ne ku iya yin waɗannan abubuwan.
I never felt out of place.	Ban taba jin babu inda yake ba.
I can do this.	Zan iya yin wannan.
In it, he describes how people viewed what was wrong.	A cikin ta, ya bayyana yadda mutane suka ɗauki abin da ba shi da kyau.
I never imagined how he got there.	Ban taba tunanin yadda ya kai can ba.
I went out and I went out.	Na fita na fita.
That is you and be sure.	Wannan shine ku kuma ku tabbata.
I saved two.	Na ajiye biyu.
I thought you were.	Na dauka kai ne.
I didn't think of anything.	Ban yi tunanin komai ba.
I see so many wonderful things in life through this project.	Ina ganin abubuwa masu ban mamaki da yawa a rayuwa ta wannan aikin.
Then everything went at once.	Daga nan sai komai ya tafi lokaci guda.
They are as follows.	Su ne kamar haka.
And he loved me.	Kuma ya so ni.
Things are starting to look up.	Abubuwa sun fara duba sama.
Imagine you are feeling really good.	Ka yi tunanin kana jin dadi sosai.
Health center.	Gidan lafiya.
But, that's what's happening.	Amma, abin da ke faruwa ke nan.
You are like me.	Kun kasance kamar ni.
He was above such a thing.	Ya kasance sama da irin wannan abu.
I'll be honest.	Zan yi gaskiya.
I'm fine with it.	Na yi lafiya da shi.
Lots and lots of surprises.	Mai yawa kuma mai ban mamaki.
We still have that.	Har yanzu muna da wannan.
Of course he did not feel well today.	Tabbas yau bai ji dadi ba.
I must go	Ina so in tafi
Everything is a work of speech.	Komai aikin magana ne.
Just know when to cut yourself.	Kawai san lokacin da za ku yanke kanku.
It can't be done.	Ba za a iya yi ba.
There is nothing he can do except time.	Babu wani abu da zai iya yi sai lokacin.
And that is part of what makes it so.	Kuma wannan yana daga cikin abin da ya sa shi ya kasance.
Exposing oneself to action in this way is a mistake.	Bayyana kansa ga aiki ta wannan hanyar kuskure ne.
This seems to be the case.	Wannan alama game da dama.
Others just don't.	Wasu kuma kamar ba su da.
From the room she did not see much.	Daga d'akin bata gani da yawa ba.
They will not worry.	Ba za su damu ba.
I did not allow myself to work or go there.	Ban bar kaina in yi aiki ba ko in je can.
You have to find something that will fix you.	Dole ne ku sami abin da zai gyara ku.
So it was with us.	Haka ya kasance tare da mu.
Or that's what he heard.	Ko abin da ya ji ke nan.
They know, and they are right.	Sun sani, kuma sun yi gaskiya.
He is a very intelligent man.	Mutum ne mai hankali.
Come here.	Shiga nan.
Just be careful.	Yi hankali kawai.
The man is dead.	Mutumin ya mutu.
I hope they did something about it.	Ina fatan sun yi wani abu game da shi.
None, it seems.	Babu ko ɗaya, da alama.
He used to love other women.	Ya kasance yana son sauran mata.
He would not like it, he said.	Ba zai so shi ba, in ji shi.
Everything is fine.	Komai na da kyau.
So he ate more breakfast.	Don haka ya kara cin abincin safe.
There were two policemen at the scene.	Wasu 'yan sanda biyu ne a wurin.
Simple but delicious food.	Abinci mai sauƙi amma mai daɗi.
They want more.	Suna son ƙarin.
He certainly did not have time.	Lallai bai da lokaci.
That has to stop.	Wannan dole ya tsaya.
They quickly swim back to the shore.	Suka yi iyo da sauri suka koma bakin ruwa.
Fear not, there are things you can do too.	Kada ku ji tsoro, akwai abubuwan da za ku iya yi ma.
She would not know how to proceed.	Ba za ta san yadda za ta ci gaba ba.
Yes, they know about that.	Haka ne, sun san game da hakan.
Everyone laughed.	Kowa yayi dariya.
Simple as it gets.	Mai sauƙi kamar yadda yake samu.
Walking and meditation became a pleasure for him.	Tafiya da tunani ya zama abin jin daɗi a gare shi.
Maybe nothing can.	Wataƙila babu abin da zai iya.
This is just a game.	Wannan wani wasa ne kawai.
We learned things.	Mun koyi abubuwa.
You can not prove anything.	Ba za ku iya tabbatar da komai ba.
Now he's gone.	Yanzu ya tafi.
Waiting is appropriate.	Jiran ya dace.
I used it.	Na yi amfani da shi.
The car sped away.	Motar ta yi ta gudu.
There will be work here.	Za a sami aiki a nan.
They think she will come back.	Suna tunanin zata dawo.
So no one is here.	Don haka babu wanda yake nan.
However, he failed to do so.	Duk da haka, ya kasa yin hakan.
She didn't want to know the name.	Ba ta son sanin suna.
That's really it.	Wannan shi ke nan da gaske.
You probably will never get one.	Wataƙila ba za ku taɓa samun ko ɗaya ba.
Thoughts were for him.	Tunani ya kasance gare shi.
It will be known.	Za a sani.
Everything happens so fast.	Komai yana faruwa da sauri.
No money for that.	Babu kudi don haka.
You did not kill him.	Ba ka kashe shi ba.
It will kill you if you try to get close to it.	Za ta kashe ka idan ka yi ƙoƙarin zuwa kusa da ita.
Make the most of your opportunity.	Yi amfani da mafi kyawun damar ku.
It takes a lot of time.	Yana ɗaukar lokaci mai yawa.
Maybe she saw something she didn't want to see.	Wataƙila ta ga abin da ba a so ta gani ba.
She knew she had to worry about him.	Ta san ya kamata ta damu da shi.
We will show them next.	Za mu nuna masu zuwa.
I feel good.	Na ji dadi.
I like spending time on it.	Ina son kashe lokaci a kai.
But nothing triggers this.	Amma babu abin da ke kunna wannan.
That is what happened here tonight.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya faru a nan a daren yau.
Do not be ignorant.	Kar ku kasance masu rashin tunani.
I don't know how to deal with this.	Ban san yadda zan yi da wannan ba.
He just had to know where to find me.	Dole ne kawai ya san inda zan samu.
It seems to be long.	Da alama ya dade.
I'm tired like a dog.	Na gaji kamar kare.
She doesn't remember things.	Ba ta tuna abubuwa.
We must change them.	Dole ne mu canza su.
She apologized, crying.	Ta bashi hakuri, cikin kuka.
I do not understand it.	ban gane shi ba.
Keep doing it.	Ku ci gaba da yin haka.
They say it looks like the movie just got better.	Sun ce ya yi kama da fim kawai ya fi kyau.
That is a fact.	Wannan ita ce gaskiya.
There is only one problem.	Akwai matsala ɗaya kawai.
Close, and yet close.	Kusa, kuma duk da haka kusa.
It's hard to say.	Yana da wuya a ce.
Of course, he was right.	Tabbas, yayi gaskiya.
I won't get it.	Ba zan samu ba.
You will leave immediately.	Za ku tafi nan da nan.
No one can do anything with it except myself.	Babu wanda zai iya yin komai da shi sai ni kaina.
The boat is on the water.	Jirgin yana bakin ruwa ne.
So shall you.	Haka kuma za ku.
He almost saved her.	Ya kusa ajiye ta.
One must go on living.	Dole ne mutum ya ci gaba da rayuwa.
The main course was comfortable.	Babban hanya ya yi dadi.
That's all he can do.	Duk abin da zai iya yi kenan.
And she was.	Kuma ta kasance.
It is a fish out of water.	Shi kifi ne daga ruwa.
It is something to say.	Wani abu ne da za a ce.
That he did it for her.	Cewa yayi mata haka.
But in the end it is not clear.	Amma a ƙarshe ba a bayyana ba.
This is not right for him.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne a gare shi.
This is definitely not going to be a working day.	Wannan tabbas ba zai zama ranar aiki ba.
Make it interesting before you actually see what you are getting.	Yi shi mai ban sha'awa kafin ku ga ainihin abin da kuke samu.
And we start the game again completely.	Kuma muna sake fara wasan gaba daya.
They work useful.	Suna aiki mai amfani.
You need to take care of yourself.	Kuna buƙatar kula da kanku.
That's it.	Yau kenan.
Can you celebrate correctly?	Za ku iya yin bikin daidai?
But we need to give them help.	Amma muna bukatar mu ba su taimako.
Man, she is so amazing.	Mutum, tana da ban mamaki sosai.
It was very difficult for him.	Yana da matukar wahala a gare shi.
I did not get it.	ban samu ba.
You make us wait for the bus!	Kuna sa mu jira bas!
What she said was true.	Abin da ta fada gaskiya ne.
Running water is necessary for survival.	Ruwan gudu ya zama dole don rayuwa.
So someone can help me the way forward.	Don haka wani zai iya taimaka mini da hanyar gaba.
So they do not know.	Don haka ba su sani ba.
It was good for me.	Ya kasance mai kyau a gare ni.
But look at this thing.	Amma ku kalli wannan abu.
But the day did not come.	Amma ranar ba ta zo ba.
Not so in this book.	Ba haka ba ne a cikin wannan littafin.
I ran faster.	Na kara gudu.
I tried to talk to myself because I thought it would.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin magana da kaina don tunanin zai yi.
Something interesting is happening.	Wani abu mai ban sha'awa yana faruwa.
And there may be some truth to that.	Kuma ana iya samun wasu gaskiya akan hakan.
That is amazing for us.	Cewa yana da ban mamaki a gare mu.
I'm sure you will.	Na tabbata za ku yi daidai.
I agree with that.	Na yarda da hakan.
She drank water.	Ta sha ruwa.
She has to take it.	Dole ta dauka.
I think it will not stop.	Ina tsammanin ba za ta daina ba.
She is so beautiful.	Ta yi kyau sosai.
One day.	Wata rana.
He will die.	Zai mutu.
You now know what you are.	Kun san yanzu me kuke.
I don’t know, either.	Ban sani ba, ni kuma.
To be.	Don zama.
I am actually very healthy.	A gaskiya ina lafiya sosai.
I don't like this.	Ba na son wannan.
You can pretend you are not afraid when studying.	Kuna iya yin kamar ba ku jin tsoro lokacin karatu.
But he did not do much work.	Amma bai yi aiki da yawa ba.
There will be no talk.	Ba za a yi magana ba.
I know him very well.	Na san shi sosai.
Not at all.	Ba a.
So we thought.	Sai muka yi tunani.
I'm not sure if there is anything else.	Ban tabbata akwai wani abu kuma ba.
If anyone can, it is you.	Idan wani zai iya, kai ne.
You will not get into trouble.	Ba za ku shiga cikin matsala ba.
To do it again.	Don yin hakan sau ɗaya kuma.
'it is'.	'yana da'.
I’ve never really worked with it.	Ban taba aiki da shi da gaske ba.
Maybe you can imagine how this goes.	Wataƙila kuna iya tunanin yadda wannan ke tafiya.
I know a lot of people who use it.	Na san mutane da yawa da suke amfani da shi.
What a surprise.	Abin ban mamaki.
Which, of course, you failed to do.	Wanda, ba shakka, kun kasa yi.
The car arrived on time.	Motar ta kai kayan akan lokaci.
It is difficult to say.	Yana da wuya a ce.
But this is not about that.	Amma wannan ba game da wannan ba.
I do not want to know anything about them.	Ba na son sanin komai game da su.
Do not call the police.	Kar a kira 'yan sanda.
It’s not a job for me, though.	Ba wani aiki na bane, ko da yake.
People do not agree or die.	Ba mutane sun yarda ko mutu ba.
We have what it takes to be the best.	Muna da abin da ake bukata don zama mafi kyau.
But do not worry, you will be well taken care of.	Amma kada ku damu, za a kula da ku sosai.
I don’t care who started thinking of what he started.	Ba na damu da wanda ya fara tunanin abin da ya fara ba.
Before he could think about where he was going, someone came and went.	Kafin ya yi tunanin inda aka kai shi, wani ya zo ya tafi.
They were living at the time.	Suna rayuwa a lokacin.
The movie became a no-brainer.	Fim ɗin ya zama ba kowa.
They played a good game.	Sun yi wasa mai kyau.
Obviously there are content.	Babu shakka akwai abubuwan ciki.
Let me tell you what happened.	Bari in gaya muku abin da ya faru.
I want to add that everything works fine.	Ina so in ƙara cewa komai yana aiki lafiya.
I do not even know what.	Ban ma san menene ba.
This will happen soon.	Wannan zai faru da sauri.
Cannot request more.	Ba za a iya neman ƙarin ba.
And on.	Kuma a kan.
I use it a lot.	Ina amfani da shi sosai.
But that will be the rest of the story as a whole.	Amma wannan zai zama sauran labarin gaba ɗaya.
There is no one near you.	Babu wani kusa da ku.
I give you every opportunity.	Na ba ku kowace dama.
This is what came to him.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya zo masa.
It may not be good, but it is there.	Yana iya zama ba mai kyau ba, amma yana can.
He left me alone.	Ya bar ni ni kadai.
Not good yet.	Ba kyau har yanzu.
Man, everyone loves you.	Mutum, kowa yana son ka.
They did not stop to look for water or food.	Ba su tsaya neman ruwa ko abinci ba.
You will be safe.	Za ku zama lafiya.
This is more successful than he hopes to achieve.	Wannan ya fi nasara fiye da yadda zai yi fatan samu.
No doubt.	Ba shakka.
He used to run every day.	Ya kasance yana gudu kowace rana.
That's right.	Yayi daidai.
She will return home when the work is done.	Zata koma gida idan an gama aikin.
So far.	Ya zuwa yanzu.
Only coffee will do well.	Kofi kawai zai yi kyau.
She will come and get it when they leave.	Zata zo ta samu idan sun tafi.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu ya ji ba daidai ba.
I hope you can enjoy it.	Ina fatan za ku iya jin daɗi.
In the end, it makes everyone better.	A ƙarshe, yana sa kowa ya fi kyau.
I can't do it alone.	Ba zan iya ni kadai ba.
You never did.	Ba ka taba ba.
I did not think so.	Ban yi tunani ba.
We just use them.	Mu kawai muke amfani da su.
Everyone will laugh at you.	Kowa zai yi muku dariya.
And they help each other.	Kuma suna taimakon juna.
Let's work on it.	Mu yi aiki da shi.
OK, but only a few.	Ya yi, amma kaɗan kawai.
But then some call it other things.	Amma sai wasu suka kira ta da wasu abubuwa.
The same thing applies here.	Haka abin yake a nan.
I would have stayed with him.	Da na zauna da shi.
He will not hear.	Ba zai ji ba.
Hope you come back soon !.	Da fatan za ku dawo sau da yawa!.
Not thought.	Ba a tunani.
It is almost not enough.	Bai kusan isa ba.
You will never know until you try.	Ba za ku taɓa sani ba sai kun gwada.
Nothing much please.	Babu wani abu da yawa don Allah.
He said walking away.	Ya fad'a yana tafiya.
I went to talk to them.	Na je zan yi magana da su.
You are the one who is not.	Kai ne wanda ba haka ba.
He knows the place very well.	Ya san wurin sosai.
Just run and keep running.	Gudu kawai ku ci gaba da gudu.
Like I haven’t changed anything about how I did in the past.	Kamar ban canza komai ba game da yadda na yi a baya.
He passed me by.	Ya wuce min.
She passed.	Ta wuce.
She is very dead.	Ta mutu sosai.
Something can happen at once.	Wani abu na iya faruwa sau ɗaya.
I am trying to write this book.	Ina ƙoƙarin rubuta wannan littafin.
You work when you want.	Kuna aiki lokacin da kuke so.
He did it hard and often.	Ya yi shi da wuya kuma sau da yawa.
It’s not fast or exciting.	Ba shi da sauri ko ban sha'awa.
Just on this board.	Kamar a wannan jirgin.
The dog ate my homework.	Kare ya ci aikin gida na.
He called me to talk.	Ya kira min magana.
The story is false.	Labarin karya ne.
Make sure you catch the last bus home.	Tabbatar ka kama bas na ƙarshe gida.
It buys us more opportunities.	Yana saya mana ƙarin dama.
It was a scary time.	Lokaci ne mai ban tsoro.
Not after the events.	Ba bayan abubuwan da suka faru ba.
He has it now.	Yana da shi yanzu.
So we got that.	Don haka da mun samu hakan.
Some have feelings.	Wasu suna da ji.
It was my first night out in a while.	Shi ne daren farko na fita cikin ɗan lokaci.
Some of us do not.	Wasu daga cikin mu ba sa yi.
She was promoted for the job.	An kara mata girma don aikin.
I did not drink but at the same time.	Ban sha ba amma lokaci guda.
We tried everything.	Mun gwada komai.
After she closed the door.	Bayan ta rufe kofar.
It helps more than you know.	Ya taimaka fiye da yadda kuka sani.
I tried and tested.	Na gwada kuma na gwada.
I am trying to help you here.	Ina ƙoƙarin taimaka muku a nan.
No one knows what to do.	Babu wanda ya san abin yi.
It will.	Zai yi.
We fell into it.	Muka fada a ciki.
To get me to come.	Don sa ni zuwa.
She continues to do so.	Ta ci gaba da yin haka.
It may surprise you.	Zai iya ba ku mamaki.
Not much has changed.	Ba yawa ya canza.
Although not so.	Ko da yake ba haka ba.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
I love watching you play.	Ina son kallon ku kuna wasa.
It works.	Yana da aiki.
It gets me.	Yana samun ni.
We are a little happy.	Muna farin ciki kaɗan.
I did a great run there.	Na yi babban gudu a can.
This is an interesting idea.	Wannan tunani ne mai ban sha'awa.
He wants to make kids laugh.	Yana son sa yara dariya.
Not much.	Ba da yawa ba.
All women.	Duk mata.
Use what you have.	Yi amfani da abin da kuke da shi.
Yet they did not.	Amma duk da haka ba su yi ba.
I love you, you know that.	Ina son ku, kun san hakan.
There is such a thing as progress.	Akwai irin wannan abu kamar ci gaba.
Whatever you do, start.	Duk abin da kuke yi, fara.
They are planning to join.	Suna shirin shiga.
I still have success.	Har yanzu ina samun nasara.
He has been sleeping for a long time.	Ya dade da yin barci.
Of course it has less space, not more.	Tabbas yana da wuri kadan, ba yawa ba.
We agree with this conclusion.	Mun yarda da wannan ƙarshe.
It became a big deal.	Ya zama babban aiki.
I would like water	Ina son ruwan
Sometimes this happens.	Wani lokaci hakan na faruwa.
I can not walk.	Ba zan iya tafiya ba.
There will be plenty of other food.	Za a sami sauran kayan abinci da yawa.
It can be useful.	Ta iya zama da amfani.
Give him a seat, please.	Ka ba shi wurin zama, don Allah.
And finally getting relief from this must be very enjoyable.	Kuma a ƙarshe samun sauƙi daga wannan dole ne ya ji daɗi sosai.
And we will do that.	Kuma za mu yi haka.
This is really.	Wannan sosai.
And so it went.	Da haka aka tafi.
Now you have to eat.	Yanzu dole ne ku ci.
This new house needs a lot of work.	Wannan sabon gidan yana buƙatar aiki mai yawa.
To me, this is the only way things are done.	A gare ni, wannan ita ce kawai hanyar da aka yi abubuwa.
Fear of the future.	Tsoron gaba.
There are so many.	Akwai da yawa da yawa.
The house must be cold by now.	Dole ne gidan ya yi sanyi a yanzu.
I do not know where you plan to go next.	Ban san inda kuke shirin zuwa na gaba ba.
Learn something together.	Koyi wani abu tare.
I am fine and being wonderful.	Ina lafiya da zama ban mamaki.
I want an immediate answer.	Ina son amsa nan take.
I tried not to, he said.	Na yi ƙoƙarin kada in yi, in ji shi.
The story is better left to chance.	Labarin ya fi kyau a bar shi ba a bayyana ba.
And if this takes more.	Kuma idan wannan ya ɗauki fiye da .
You must kill him.	Dole ne ku kashe shi.
Maybe he too was scared.	Wataƙila shi ma ya ji tsoro.
Let's hope they can be better.	Bari mu yi fatan za su iya zama mafi kyau.
Call me if you know anything.	Kira ni idan kun san wani abu.
I do not go to music.	Ba na zuwa waƙa.
She used to tell him everything.	Ta kasance tana gaya masa komai.
So they both went.	Haka su biyu suka tafi.
Still early.	Har yanzu da wuri.
Maybe she knows what's coming.	Wataƙila ta san abin da ke zuwa.
Can anyone help me the best way.	Shin kowa zai iya taimaka mani hanya mafi kyau.
Maybe one day that will change.	Wataƙila wata rana hakan zai canza.
People like me.	Mutane sun so ni.
Now he is interested.	Yanzu yana sha'awar.
Something must be done about this.	Dole ne a yi wani abu game da wannan.
I do not know what they will do next.	Ban san abin da za su yi a gaba ba.
You have to do it yourself.	Dole ne ku yi hakan da kanku.
I have always wanted the world.	Ina so koyaushe a duniya.
And let's go.	Kuma mu tafi.
And we know what to do.	Kuma mun san abin da ya kamata mu yi.
This is the first.	Wannan shi ne na farko.
She thought he was going to be a kid.	Ta yi tunanin zai kasance yaro.
We just do our job.	Aikin mu kawai muke yi.
So let's meet people.	Don haka mu hadu da mutane.
So let's try another method.	Don haka bari mu gwada wata hanya.
He did it in a wonderful way.	Ya yi haka a wata hanya mai ban mamaki.
No, it would not have been left behind.	A'a, da ba a bar shi a baya ba.
It looks like.	Yayi kama .
I'm sure, like me.	Na tabbata, kamar ni.
But you did that to me.	Amma kun yi min haka.
I have never heard anything bad before.	Ban taba jin wani mummunan abu ba a baya.
She sure does.	Ta tabbata ya yi.
It's a little better than the last.	Ya ɗan fi na ƙarshe kyau.
But not much.	Amma babu da yawa.
Maybe there are opportunities.	Wataƙila akwai dama.
This will be useful in the coming.	Wannan zai zama da amfani a cikin masu zuwa.
We know that better now.	Mun fi sanin hakan a yanzu.
Listen, you don't have to go.	Ji, ba sai ka je ba.
He is mine.	Shi nawa ne.
She never wanted to get married.	Bata taba son yin aure ba.
They have no thought in them.	Ba su da wani tunani a cikin su.
Join me on the journey.	Shiga ni a kan tafiya.
So she got married.	Don haka ta yi aure.
Not a little.	Ba kadan ba.
She wondered how long it would take.	Ta yi mamakin tsawon lokacin da zai dauka.
We cannot say we love them.	Ba za mu iya cewa muna son su ba.
We will see if that is true.	Za mu gani idan hakan ya tabbata.
I was there myself.	Na kasance can da kaina.
It didn't take long.	Bai dade ba.
Sometimes I think so.	Wani lokaci ina tunanin haka.
It's nothing.	Ba komai bane.
I'll just tell you the truth.	Zan yi muku gaskiya kawai.
God is afraid.	Allah ya ji tsoro.
I will cover it.	Ni ne zan rufe shi.
No problem there.	Babu matsala a can.
Don't think of the person.	Kar ka yi tunanin mutumin.
Maybe they will do this.	Wataƙila za su yi ta wannan.
But in fact he never left.	Amma a gaskiya bai taba barin ba.
And you know how much.	Kuma ku san nawa.
This is a sad time in the world.	Wannan lokaci ne na bakin ciki a duniya.
I'll fix that over the weekend.	Zan gyara hakan karshen mako.
He did not let anything pass.	Bai bari komai ya wuce ba.
It was very hot today, but it was very cold yesterday.	Yau da zafi sosai, amma jiya an yi sanyi.
He could have proved it.	Da ma zai iya tabbatar da hakan.
This should not come as a surprise.	Wannan bai kamata ya zo da mamaki ba.
It looks amazing.	Yana kama da ban mamaki.
Like smoking and drinking, like me today.	Kamar shan taba da sha, kamar ni na yau.
It felt like the only real thing to do.	Ya ji kamar gaskiya kawai abin yi.
It was an exciting time to grow.	Lokaci ne mai ban sha'awa don girma.
Every two to three months.	Duk wata biyu zuwa uku.
I want to change that.	Ina so in canza hakan.
The health center is nearby.	Wurin kula da lafiya yana nan kusa.
Published	An buga
I immediately told them to remove.	Nan take na ce su cire.
It's hard to lose.	Yana da wuya a rasa.
Maybe she knows something.	Wataƙila ta san wani abu.
I want to show people how to learn to love him.	Ina so in nuna wa mutane yadda za su koyi son shi.
We can see how this goes.	Muna iya ganin yadda wannan ke tafiya.
That should help.	Ya kamata hakan ya taimaka.
I want it to be amazing.	Ina so ya zama abin mamaki.
It makes me work.	Yana sa ni aiki.
The players saw nothing.	'Yan wasan ba su ga komai ba.
I can keep trying to do it.	Zan iya ci gaba da ƙoƙarin yin shi.
It will make you sick.	Zai sa ku rashin lafiya.
But we will continue to do this together.	Amma za mu ci gaba da wannan tare.
Can only do it when called.	Iya kawai yi idan an kira shi.
It's easy so you can do it now.	Yana da sauƙi don haka za ku iya yin shi a yanzu.
And it only comes to that end.	Kuma ya zo ga kawai wannan ƙarshe.
It does not seem to do this yet.	Da alama baya yin wannan duk da haka.
Each user has a name and age.	Kowane mai amfani yana da suna da shekaru.
Women did nothing.	Mata ba su yi komai ba.
I left a lot to be desired.	Na bar abubuwa da yawa ba shakka.
She was surprised.	Ta yi mamaki.
He went outside and looked up.	Ya fita waje ya kalli sama.
It’s not much, but we love it.	Ba shi da yawa, amma muna son shi.
We are in this together no matter what happens.	Muna cikin wannan tare ko da me ya faru.
I have no doubt about that.	Ba ni da wata shakka game da hakan.
I finished it but I have a problem like this.	Na gama da shi amma ina da matsala kamar wannan.
If we do there is no reason to live.	Idan muka yi da babu dalilin rayuwa.
Sometimes it is better not to look.	Wani lokaci ya fi kyau kada a duba.
How it became a household name passed me by.	Yadda ta zama sunan gida ya wuce ni.
I could never buy what she said.	Ban taba iya siyan abin da ta ce ba.
Getting you out of work.	Samun ku daga aiki.
Two things about that, though.	Abubuwa biyu game da hakan, ko da yake.
This must have happened to you a lot.	Wannan tabbas ya faru da ku sosai.
And you made a mistake.	Kuma kun yi kuskure.
I wish I could be just like you.	Da ma in yi kamar yadda kuke.
Two things happened.	Abubuwa biyu sun faru.
I can find myself.	Zan iya samun kansa.
That's what you do.	Haka kuke yi.
I was very happy when I did.	Na yi farin ciki sosai lokacin da na yi.
They could not run inside.	Sun kasa gudu ciki.
It's too late.	Ya makara.
Not as surprising as the first one, but it is still very good.	Ba abin mamaki ba kamar na farko, amma har yanzu yana da kyau sosai.
You should give them more than that.	Ya kamata ku ba su da yawa fiye da haka.
People will get up.	Mutane za su tashi.
Was she waiting?	Ta kasance tana jira?
We like what we do.	Muna son abin da muke yi.
I have things to do.	Ina da abubuwan da zan yi.
Getting a job today is not an easy task.	Samun aiki a yau ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
I think we explained that.	Ina jin mun bayyana hakan.
Why is this happening?	Me yasa hakan ke faruwa?
Now this is more than any human feeling.	Yanzu wannan ya fi kowane ji na mutum.
However, this is not the whole story.	Duk da haka, wannan ba duka labarin ba ne.
The food was delicious.	Abincin yayi dadi.
And at that moment it appeared that he was contemplating suicide.	Kuma a wannan lokacin ya bayyana cewa yana tunanin kashe kansa.
And we never knew when he would lose her.	Kuma ba mu taba sanin lokacin da zai rasa ta ba.

They were in the program.	Sun kasance cikin shirin.
I do not know what happened to me at the time.	Ban san abin da ya faru da ni a lokacin.
For you, every moment is right.	A gare ku, kowane lokaci ya yi daidai.
And we are not alone.	Kuma ba mu kadai ba.
So you have a lot of rich kids.	Don haka kuna da yara masu kuɗi masu yawa.
Let me call it.	Bari in kira shi.
He is also intelligent.	Shi ma mai hankali ne.
Too much will kill you.	Da yawa zai kashe ku.
I do not know exactly how it is.	Ban san daidai ta ba.
I want you to know for sure.	Ina so ku san hakan tabbas.
She continues to do so.	Ta ci gaba da yin haka.
They are closed.	An rufe su.
She is a little disappointed.	Ta dan bata rai.
The world wanted to kill me or arrest me.	Duniya ta so ta kashe ni ko ta kama ni.
So we both went there at night.	Don haka mu biyu muka je can da dare.
Some of you, stay where you are.	Ku wasu, ku zauna a inda kuke.
We do this every year.	Muna yin haka kowace shekara.
Write at night.	Rubuta da dare.
Let me take you to my favorite place.	Bari in kai ku wurin da na fi so.
That would be great.	Hakan zai yi kyau sosai.
I caught her again and lied.	Na sake kama ta da karya.
But that is good.	Amma hakan yayi kyau.
It should not be difficult to find good hope.	Bai kamata ya zama da wahala a sami kyakkyawan fata ba.
I have one skin.	Ina da fata guda daya.
I slept twice.	Na yi barci sau biyu.
She felt comfortable.	Ta ji dadi.
We will continue.	Za mu ci gaba.
We would have done better.	Da mun yi kyau.
She did not play.	Ba ta yi wasa ba.
Please help with this.	Don Allah a taimaka da wannan.
It feels like a beautiful home to grow in.	Yana jin kamar gida mai kyau da za a girma a ciki.
They all went well until morning.	Duk sun tafi lafiya har safe.
Can anyone show it to me?	Shin wani zai iya nuna min shi?.
They can live without money.	Suna iya rayuwa ba tare da kuɗi ba.
We were caught in the rain.	An kama mu a cikin ruwan sama.
If your plan works, just stay on track.	Idan shirin ku yana aiki, kawai ku tsaya kan hanya.
That would be a sight to behold.	Wannan zai zama abin gani.
I can't explain everything at once.	Ba zan iya bayyana komai a lokaci guda ba.
She changed a lot.	Ta canza da yawa.
Three other girls and me.	Wasu 'yan mata uku da ni.
I never killed anyone.	Ban taba kashe kowa ba.
And he knows me too.	Kuma ya san ni ma.
But we never recommend this.	Amma ba mu taba ba da shawarar wannan ba.
The truth is true.	Gaskiya gaskiya ne.
But it is not the best.	Amma ba ita ce mafi kyau ba.
Drink even more water.	A sha ruwa har ma da yawa.
It should be very large.	Ya kamata ya zama mai girma sosai.
The school will be closed.	Za a rufe makaranta.
Highly for material.	Sosai ga kayan abu.
Take off your shirt, please.	Cire rigar ka, don Allah.
You should do something about it.	Ya kamata ku yi wani abu game da hakan.
Either way, he spoke more than he should.	Ko ta yaya, ya yi magana fiye da yadda ya kamata.
You can see for yourself there is nothing wrong with me anymore.	Kuna iya ganin kanku babu wani abu a kaina kuma.
She's on it.	Tana kan shi.
I find it hard to sleep at home.	Ina da wuya in yi barci a gida.
This is the way it has always been.	Wannan ita ce hanyar da ta kasance koyaushe.
It should be difficult.	Ya kamata ya zama mai wuya.
I did what you did not want.	Na yi abin da ba ku so.
Make sure there is no hope of seeing.	Tabbatar cewa babu fata da ke gani.
No matter what she does, she will never succeed.	Duk yadda ta yi, ba za ta iya yin nasara ba.
It is not difficult to do.	Ba shi da wuya a yi.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
But let's think about this.	Amma bari mu yi tunani game da wannan.
She still needs money for everything.	Har yanzu tana buƙatar kuɗi don komai.
There is no way it will not reach us.	Babu wata hanyar da ba za ta kai mu ba.
We used to feel comfortable.	Mun kasance muna jin dadi.
I have food and water.	Ina da abinci da ruwa.
But for me it was, in a very strange way.	Amma a gare ni ya kasance, a wata hanya mai ban mamaki.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
Lots of hot water.	Ruwan zafi mai yawa.
I'll fight first.	Zan yi fada na farko.
And that's really what we've been in the past.	Kuma da gaske abin da muka kasance a baya kenan.
In fact, it is one of our favorites.	A gaskiya ma, yana ɗaya daga cikin abubuwan da muka fi so.
The same is true today.	Haka yake a yau.
Lunch was good today.	Abincin rana ya yi dadi a yau.
We need to work together.	Muna bukatar mu yi aiki tare.
He knew he could not succeed.	Ya san cewa ba zai iya yin nasara ba.
We are here, and we will stop here.	Muna nan, kuma za mu tsaya a nan.
There is nothing to fear.	Babu abin tsoro.
So it is ahead.	Don haka yana kan gaba.
See, as follows.	Duba, kamar haka.
In the car too.	A cikin motar kuma.
You have to understand that.	Dole ne ku gane hakan.
I never thought of it.	Bata taba tunani ba.
Even if it hurts, keep going.	Ko da ya ji wuya, ci gaba.
The world is small.	Duniya kadan ce.
We'll see what happens.	Za mu ga abin da ya faru.
The sun is divine.	Rana allah ne.
You will be sorry.	Za ku yi hakuri.
We do not know exactly where we are.	Ba mu san ainihin inda muke ba.
So she got him back on track.	A haka ta dawo da shi hanya.
I said yes.	Na ce haka ne.
He doesn't eat much.	Ba ya cin abinci da yawa.
She even enjoyed it.	Ta ma ji daɗi.
I suggest that it can be a lot.	Ina ba da shawarar cewa zai iya zama da yawa.
And maybe she was.	Kuma watakila ta kasance.
He was surprised.	Ya yi mamaki.
He kept looking down.	Ya ci gaba da kallon kasa.
He was raised to see him on the road.	An daga shi dan ganin shi a hanya.
It cannot be said that you are right.	Ba za a iya cewa kuna nan daidai ba.
He certainly had never seen this before.	Ya tabbata bai taba ganin wannan ba.
Next to him was a boy who seemed to be sleeping.	Kusa da shi akwai wani yaro da ya yi kamar barci.
But night was his favorite time.	Amma dare ya kasance lokacin da ya fi so.
He saw her come and go.	Ya ga ta zo ta tafi.
Do you think of others.	Kuna tunanin wasu kuma.
This needs to be looked into immediately.	Ana bukatar a duba hakan nan take.
If you do not know.	Idan baka sani ba.
Everyone gets mistakes from time to time.	Kowa yana samun kuskure lokaci zuwa lokaci.
That day will be better.	Wannan rana za ta yi kyau.
I tell you what I have been told.	Ina gaya muku abin da aka gaya mini.
It started to rain.	Nan take aka fara ruwan sama.
I just want to.	Ina so kawai.
Maybe she is still waiting.	Wataƙila tana jira har yanzu.
No one has ever felt comfortable around here.	Babu wanda ya taɓa jin daɗi a kusa da nan.
Only.	Kawai.
I have to know who did this.	Dole ne in san wanda ya yi wannan.
I should have been done by now.	Ya kamata a yi ni zuwa yanzu.
Don't like them here yet.	Kar ku so su nan tukuna.
Do not call again.	Kar a sake kira.
He even worked on a film.	Har ma yayi aiki akan fim.
It came completely.	Ya zo gaba daya.
Patience is not a problem.	Hakuri ba matsala.
This is a good job.	Wannan kyakkyawan aiki ne.
I need to get home to have dinner.	Ina bukata in isa gida in yi abincin dare.
I know that for sure.	Na san hakan a gaskiya.
He had everything he could want.	Yana da duk abin da zai iya so.
I myself am slowly getting involved.	Ni kaina nake shiga a hankali.
I was just a kid, no one told me anything.	Ni yaro ne kawai, babu wanda ya gaya mani komai.
Maybe I missed one, though.	Wataƙila na rasa ɗaya, ko da yake.
If so, it will take longer.	Idan haka ne, zai ɗauka.
This is what seems to be happening.	Abin da ake ganin kamar yana faruwa ke nan.
He did not plan it.	Bai shirya hakan ba.
Everything that happens must happen because something happened.	Duk abin da ya faru dole ne ya faru saboda wani abu ne ya sa ya faru.
There is little to do.	Akwai kadan a yi.
Maybe even like three.	Watakila har ma kamar uku.
We are not doing this right now.	Ba mu yin wannan a yanzu.
Same to you.	Kuma.
Apparently no one knows the real reason.	Da alama babu wanda ya san ainihin dalilin.
They will last almost a year.	Za su kasance kusan shekaru ɗaya.
That didn't pay off.	Wannan bai biya komai ba.
Things are going well.	Abubuwa sun yi kyau.
She knows better.	Ta fi sani.
I need to show you something.	Ina bukata in nuna maka wani abu.
You do that.	Kuna yi haka.
I have always known.	Na san koyaushe.
That was his own hand.	Hakan yasa hannu da kansa.
There is nothing new here.	Babu wani sabon abu a nan.
So it needs to change.	Don haka yana bukatar ya canza.
I have been watching you for two years.	Shekara biyu ina kallon ku.
You have the tools to be a good player.	Kuna da kayan aikin don zama ɗan wasa mai kyau.
She would not speak.	Ba za ta yi magana ba.
She came out.	Ta fito.
There are so many things.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa.
He told me a lot of interesting things.	Ya gaya mani abubuwa masu ban sha'awa da yawa.
Wrong, it's too late.	Ba daidai ba, ya wuce lokacin.
Something was there that he had never seen before.	Wani abu yana nan wanda bai taba gani ba.
So we got up and walked a little.	Sai muka tashi muka dan yi tafiya kadan.
Maybe this is not the best way to do it.	Wataƙila wannan ba shine mafi kyawun hanyar yin sa ba.
One person must go outside.	Dole ne mutum daya ya fita waje.
But he would say nothing.	Amma zai ce komai.
He is very familiar with them.	Ya saba da su sosai.
Even fighting didn’t.	Ko fada bata yi ba.
Time to run for it.	Lokaci don yin gudu don shi.
I feel really good.	Na ji sosai.
Maybe this is true.	Wataƙila wannan gaskiya ne.
If only they could.	Idan da za su iya.
They did a lot.	Sun yi da yawa.
She does not have.	Ba ta da.
He is in a car accident.	Yana cikin motar motar.
I don't feel it was.	Ba na jin ya kasance.
I know he did.	Na san ya yi.
I want him to feel the same way.	Ina son shi ma ya ji haka.
Travel is easy.	Tafiya yana da sauƙi.
But he never spoke.	Amma bai taba magana ba.
You just know them.	Kun san su kawai.
They waited and waited.	Sai da suka jira suna jira.
I'm so glad to see you again.	Na yi matukar farin cikin sake ganin ku.
But that has grown.	Amma hakan yayi girma.
And kill us.	Kuma kashe mu.
To wish him well.	Don yi masa fatan ta tafi.
You need to know everything.	Kuna buƙatar sanin komai.
He has nothing and does not really work for anything.	Ba shi da wani abu kuma ba ya aiki da gaske ga wani abu.
This is a boy who grows up fast.	Wannan yaro ne da ya girma da sauri.
I'm talking now.	Ina magana yanzu.
No one is here.	Babu kowa a nan.
We will work on these.	Za mu yi aiki a kan waɗannan.
It's scary.	Abu ne mai ban tsoro.
So she stayed there for a while.	A haka ta zauna a can na wani lokaci.
He knew he had to do something.	Ya san ya kamata ya yi wani abu.
When you think the world should stop, just keep moving.	Lokacin da kuke tunanin yakamata duniya ta tsaya, kawai ta ci gaba da tafiya.
They do it slowly, you see.	A hankali suke yi, ka gani.
It was a beautiful day.	Rana ce mai kyau.
Nothing more.	Babu wani abu kuma.
And that is wrong.	Kuma hakan ba daidai ba ne.
She has several others.	Tana da wasu da dama.
The night has come.	Dare ya zo.
I have a scary head.	Ina da kai mai ban tsoro.
Marriage and children see it that way.	Aure da yara sun ga haka.
We love the past, or hope for what we do not have.	Muna son abin da ya wuce, ko fatan abin da ba mu da shi.
This is not the case here.	Wannan ba haka yake ba a nan.
But they are a bit similar.	Amma suna da ɗan kama.
Some are serious.	Wasu suna da gaske.
Maybe we will get closer to them one day.	Wataƙila za mu je kusa da su wata rana.
It will not be now.	Ba za ta kasance yanzu ba.
It's just that it doesn't pay.	Shi ne kawai cewa ba ya biya.
This, of course, is wrong.	Wannan, ba shakka, ba daidai ba ne.
In fact there are many more than two.	A gaskiya akwai da yawa fiye da biyu.
He told me the truth.	Yace min gaskiya.
That's what we do.	Haka muke yi.
When you finish this, it will be night.	In kun gama wannan, dare zai yi.
Maybe she was in your whole body and she didn’t show it.	Wataƙila ta kasance cikin ku gaba ɗaya kuma ba ta nuna shi ba.
That decision is final.	Wannan shawarar ta tabbata.
I will stop.	Zan daina.
This material is very weak.	Wannan kayan yana da rauni sosai.
We don't need one.	Ba mu bukatar daya.
I could see what was going on around him.	Ina iya ganin abin da ke faruwa a kusa da shi.
I do not know how to read these things.	Ban san yadda zan karanta waɗannan abubuwan ba.
He hit one and didn’t really think about it.	Ya buga daya kuma bai yi tunani sosai a kai ba.
Certainly not.	Lallai ba su kasance ba.
To end it, we must change.	Don kawo karshen shi, dole ne mu canza.
Stop fighting stop fighting.	A daina fada a daina fada.
They will increase.	Za su ƙara ƙara.
You know it's true.	Ka san gaskiya ce.
I want to talk to you when you can.	Ina so in yi magana da ku lokacin da za ku iya.
I know what they did.	Na san abin da suka yi.
I really made that decision.	Da gaske na yanke wannan shawarar.
This is very sad.	Wannan abin bakin ciki ne sosai.
I also do not drink hot coffee.	Ni kuma ba na shan kofi mai zafi.
Assume that it is.	Ka dauka cewa shi ne.
Not easy yet.	Ba abu mai sauƙi ba tukuna.
You will probably have trouble sleeping tonight,	Wataƙila za ku sami matsalar barci a daren yau,
Today is not true.	Yau ba gaskiya bane.
They can't touch me.	Ba za su iya taba ni ba.
He believed.	Ya ba da gaskiya.
There is a lot of money around there.	Akwai kuɗi da yawa a kusa da wurin.
You hardly hear them.	Da wuya ka ji su.
Call thought only thought, hear only hear.	Kira tunani kawai tunani, ji kawai ji.
I have tried these but not all.	Na gwada irin waɗannan amma ba ɗaya ba ne.
There is fear.	Akwai tsoro.
I like many things at the same time.	Ina son abubuwa da yawa lokaci guda.
They should get something from someone else.	Ya kamata su sami wani abu daga wani.
But one day, you may get sick.	Amma wata rana, kuna iya yin rashin lafiya.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane.
Drink like coffee.	Sha kamar kofi.
I do not understand exactly why this is so.	Ban fahimci ainihin dalilin da ya sa haka yake ba.
You are an active person.	Kai mutum ne mai aiki.
Just because others are looking for this advice.	Kawai don wasu suna neman wannan shawarar.
I need to change this and do something every day.	Ina buƙatar canza wannan kuma in yi wani abu kowace rana.
They are not very good.	Ba su da kyau sosai.
I want to know exactly what they are saying.	Ina so in san ainihin abin da suke cewa.
The program is nearing completion.	An kusa kawo karshen shirin.
I went to check it out, but no one was there.	Na je duba shi, amma ba kowa a wurin.
And you will be here too.	Kuma za ku kasance a nan ma.
It is of no use.	Ba wani amfani.
You don't care.	Ba ku kula.
Do not let me explain it.	Kar ku sa ni in bayyana shi.
But he knew what he was going to do.	Amma ya san abin da zai yi.
We make sure you can log in yourself.	Mun sanya za ku iya shiga da kanku.
I never thought they would show.	Ban taba tunanin za su nuna ba.
This you will see.	Wannan za ku gani.
Be in something bigger than myself.	Kasance cikin wani abu mafi girma fiye da kaina.
The doctor said no.	Likitan yace a'a.
It rained for three days.	Ana ruwan sama har kwana uku.
She only said she was brought home from school.	Sai kawai ta ce an dawo da ita gida daga makaranta.
However, we like to look through others, however.	Duk da haka, muna son neman ta wasu, duk da haka.
But it does not always work that way.	Amma ba koyaushe yana aiki haka ba.
I'll be back, but not yet.	Zan dawo, amma ba tukuna ba.
But she was not.	Amma ba ta kasance ba.
It has to be work, school.	Dole ne ya zama aikin, makaranta.
And we almost did.	Kuma mun kusan yi.
Time is of the essence.	Lokaci yana da matukar amfani.
The money is there, they have not been touched.	Kuɗin yana nan, ba a taɓa su ba.
So sometimes.	Don haka wani lokaci.
She used to go out.	Ta kasance tana fita.
You keep saying that.	Kuna ci gaba da cewa.
They can not help us.	Ba za su iya taimaka mana ba.
To give her what she wants.	Don ba ta abin da take so.
Let's just wait.	Mu jira kawai.
That didn't make the world a horror movie.	Hakan bai sa duniya ta zama fim mai ban tsoro ba.
We can't do that.	Ba za mu iya yin haka ba.
He must see and hear.	Dole ne ya gani kuma ya ji.
It makes the world a better place.	Yana sa duniya ta fi kyau.

You do not want that.	Ba ka son hakan.
They did a good job though.	Sun yi kyakkyawan aiki ko da yake.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Babu wani abu a kai.
He would never let me live like that.	Ba zai taba barin ni rayuwa haka ba.
It’s too much to keep pregnant.	Ya yi yawa don ci gaba da ciki.

Really, he did really well with me.	Da gaske, ya yi kyau sosai da ni.
Be sure to cover this with a wet cloth.	Tabbatar rufe wannan da rigar rigar.
She wants to know you.	Tana son ta san ka.
Did you enjoy dinner tonight?	Shin kun ji daɗin abincin dare na yau?
Life goes on.	Rayuwa ta ci gaba.

Water, water and extra water!	Ruwa, ruwa da ƙarin ruwa!

He would not even hear.	Ba zai ma ji ba.
Does anyone have an answer here ?.	Shin akwai wanda ke da amsa a nan?.
He also started a little bit.	Shi ma ya fara dan kadan.
This was close to what he needed.	Wannan ya kasance kusa da abin da yake bukata.
I thought it was funny.	Na yi tunanin abin ban dariya ne.
But he did, and he remains.	Amma ya yi, kuma ya kasance.
If you want do not go.	Idan kuna son kada ku tafi.
Now it is certain that something has happened.	Yanzu ya tabbata wani abu ya faru.

Amazing life !.	Rayuwa mai ban mamaki!.
They are all gone.	Duk sun tafi.

He didn't bring it, so she didn't get it either.	Bai kawo ba, don haka ita ma ba ta samu ba.
That's what it means.	Abin da ya bayyana kenan.
I was surprised when you called.	Na yi mamaki lokacin da kuka kira.

Do not look tomorrow, even though the sun is there.	Kada ku duba gobe, ko da yake rana tana can.
If you can’t save it, don’t worry.	Idan ba za ku iya ajiye shi ba, kada ku damu.
Someone has to pay for all this work.	Dole ne wani ya biya duk wannan aikin.

We seem to think these things are necessary for a healthy diet today.	Da alama muna tunanin waɗannan abubuwa sun zama dole don abinci mai lafiya a yau.

He wasted no time.	Bai bata lokaci ba.
We decided to think about it tomorrow.	Mun yanke shawarar yin tunani game da shi gobe.

This you really will not like.	Wannan da gaske ba za ku so ba.
The night would not be the best.	Dare ba zai zama mafi kyau ba.

A lot of time and money and thought went into this.	Lokaci mai yawa da kudi da tunani sun shiga cikin wannan.
There is beautiful water nearby.	Akwai kyakkyawan ruwa a kusa.
O God, what a terrible escape.	Ya Allah, abin tsoro wanda ya gudu.
Now and then.	Yanzu da kuma.
She has been here for many years.	Ta yi shekaru da yawa a nan.

Or do something worthwhile to write about.	Ko yi wani abu da ya dace a rubuta game da shi.

It rained at night.	An yi ruwan sama a cikin dare.

The faster you want them, the more money will be spent.	Da sauri kuke so su, ƙarin kuɗi zai kashe.
But again, that did not feel right.	Amma kuma, hakan bai ji daidai ba.
She called again, too.	Ta sake kira, kuma.
They don’t care if the person loves them.	Ba su damu ba ko mutumin yana son su.
They were all arrested.	An kama su duka.
I can know when he is happy and when he is not.	Zan iya sanin lokacin da yake jin daɗi da lokacin da ba ya.

So you have to be right.	Don haka ya zama kun yi daidai.
They will not.	Ba za su yi ba.
Nothing will change.	Babu abin da zai canza.
She will not end this without fighting.	Ba za ta kawo karshen wannan ba tare da fada ba.
You are afraid of yourself.	Kuna tsoron kanku.
If you do, you will not.	Idan kun yi, ba ku.

Correction should occur immediately after injury.	Gyara ya kamata ya faru da sauri bayan rauni.

But it does not seem to work.	Amma da alama bai yi aiki ba.

He himself told me he would not bring me back.	Shi kansa ya gaya mani ba zai dawo da ni ba.

Not about these things.	Ba game da waɗannan abubuwan ba.
He was smart, and he was good.	Ya kasance mai hankali, kuma yana da kyau.
At the time he did not tell me why he had reached that point.	A lokacin bai gaya mani dalilin da ya sa ya kai ga haka ba.
I can't see anything.	Babu abin da zan gani.
Only the first.	Kawai na farko.
It is a life-changing experience.	Rayuwa ce ta canza.

Gradually he began to realize that something was wrong.	A hankali ya fara gane cewa wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
I was in common.	Na a cikin na kowa.
And after all yes.	Kuma bayan duk a.
Nor did they accept it.	Haka kuma ba su yarda da shi ba.

But all is not as bad as it could be.	Amma duk ba daidai ba ne kamar yadda zai iya zama.
He had no man at the time.	Ya ba shi da wani mutum a lokacin.
When he just started to take it.	Lokacin da kawai ya fara ɗauka.
She went to the door and opened it.	Ta je bakin kofar ta bude.
They will do what they want.	Za su yi abin da suke so.
We will work all the time when you are the best.	Za mu yi aiki duka lokacin da kuka fi kyau.
She also killed another man.	Ita ma ta kashe wani mutum.

Stay with them.	Zauna da su.

Place now, place later, place inside.	Sanya yanzu, wuri daga baya, sanya a ciki.
She wanted to hear more of them, more than that.	Ta so ta kara jin su, fiye da haka.
Knowledge is a must.	Sanin dole ne.

He was like kids, girls.	Ya kasance kamar yara, 'yan mata.
You know, this stuff is delicious.	Ka sani, wannan kayan yana da daɗi.
No one wanted to.	Babu wanda ya so.
Amazing things, one and all.	Abubuwan ban mamaki, daya da duka.
I hated everything about that.	Na ƙi komai game da wannan.
If you will.	Idan kuna so.
How much he did not.	Nawa bai yi ba.
Many people are worried about the problem too.	Mutane da yawa sun damu da matsalar kuma.
Maybe it's something entirely.	Wataƙila wani abu ne gaba ɗaya.
It’s a lot more than that.	Yana da yawa fiye da haka.
I wonder if this book will work for me.	Ina mamakin ko wannan littafin zai yi mani aiki.
You can not go out on your own, you can not.	Ba za ku iya fita daga kanku ba, ba za ku iya ba.
It is what we need most of all.	Shi ne abin da muke bukata fiye da komai.
You may feel curious.	Kuna iya jin sha'awar sani.

If they do, that's it.	Idan sun yi kenan.
He knows the way.	Ya san hanya.
I went outside.	Na koma waje.

You can try it.	Kuna iya gwada shi.
They will or will not.	Za su yi ko ba za su yi ba.
I'm sure he got it.	Na tabbata ya samu.
It was played well.	An yi wasa da kyau.
Water is needed for survival.	Ana buƙatar ruwa don rayuwa.
But some did not get what others were saying.	Amma wasu ba su sami abin da wasu ke cewa ba.
She always knew what to say.	Kullum ta san me zata ce.
It is even interesting actually what is added there.	Har ma yana da ban sha'awa ainihin abin da aka ƙara a can.

I do not know why it was added to the film.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa aka kara ta a fim ba.

This night was very pleasant.	Wannan dare yayi dadi sosai.
This work is an attempt in this way.	Wannan aikin ƙoƙari ne a wannan hanya.

Eating is hard.	Cin abinci ke da wuya.
She seemed to be crying.	Ta yi kamar za ta yi kuka.
But there is a catch.	Amma akwai kama.
I do not know what will happen to me in the future.	Ban san abin da zai faru da ni a gaba ba.
It was a surprise for us.	Ya kasance abin mamaki a gare mu.
That surprised me.	Hakan ya bani mamaki.
But one thing is certain.	Amma abu daya ya tabbata.
I will close.	Zan rufe.
I read it and I love it.	Na karanta kuma ina son shi.
Money paid and she quickly left the restaurant.	Kudi ta biya ta fita da sauri daga gidan abinci.
He works almost every day of the year.	Ya yi aiki kusan kowace rana na shekara.
We can do better.	Za mu iya yin mafi kyau.
She also lives nearby.	Ita ma tana zaune a kusa.
It's too fast.	Yayi sauri sosai.

Remove it.	Cire shi.
Everyone loves it.	Kowa ya so shi.
Another will be together for a while.	Wani kuma zai kasance tare a cikin ɗan lokaci.
But he still did not do so.	Amma duk da haka bai yi haka ba.
It was easy, fast, inside and out.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi, mai sauri, ciki da waje.
The trip was enjoyable later.	Tafiya ta ji daɗi daga baya.
I'm so glad to see you.	Na yi matukar farin cikin ganin ku.
Everything here is just amazing.	Komai a nan abin ban mamaki ne kawai.

Life will be very difficult.	Rayuwa za ta yi wahala sosai.

We can not confirm how much he told you.	Ba mu iya tabbatar da nawa ya gaya muku ba.
No one will go.	Babu wanda zai je.
You can not.	Ba za ku iya ba.
This is not the way forward.	Wannan ba hanya ce ta gaba ba.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu ya faru.
This is a lie.	Wannan karya ce.
They will talk to you about it.	Za su yi magana da ku game da shi.
Of course there are others who feel like you.	Tabbas akwai wasu da suke ji kamar ku.
He is or we are.	Shi ne ko mu.
He was happy for a while.	Yayi farin ciki na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
He had to say something.	Sai da ya ce wani abu.
I would be very happy for any help.	Zan yi matukar farin ciki ga kowane taimako.
We like coffee.	Muna son kofi.
He was amazing and he knew.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki kuma ya sani.
I think he knows where to look.	Ina tsammanin ya san inda zai duba.
I have to be first.	Dole ne in zama na farko.
They must be allowed to play.	Dole ne a ba su damar yin wasa.
It should be below.	Ya kamata a kasa.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Every two people.	Kowane mutum biyu.
Everyone was running at the time.	Kowa yana gudu a lokacin.
You just cried.	Kuka kawai.
After she sat down she cried for a while.	Bayan ta zauna ta yi kuka na ɗan lokaci.
Time has passed for many things.	Lokaci ya wuce don abubuwa da yawa.
I know you are right.	Na san kana da gaskiya.
I hope to see you again.	Ina fatan sake ganin ku.
That's what we thought.	Abin da muka yi tunani kenan.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
I have to be careful.	Dole ne in yi hankali.
He could not speak to me.	Ya kasa yi mani magana.
Ask about them.	Tambayi game da su.
I am not the desired one.	Ni ba wanda ake so ba ne.

Towards the end.	Zuwa karshen.
Now you can have everything.	Yanzu za ku iya samun komai.

So it is true.	Don haka gaskiya ne.
Cut it quickly.	Yanke shi da sauri.

So far everything is fine.	Ya zuwa yanzu komai yana da kyau.
Come with me now.	Ku zo tare da ni yanzu.
Sorry no can.	Yi hakuri babu iya yi.
This will be faster.	Wannan zai yi sauri.
It was as if she had never heard anything.	Kamar babu abin da ta taɓa ji.
I do not want to do any of these things.	Ban son yin ko ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan.
I want it to be real.	Ina so ya kasance da gaske.
Something that can change everything.	Wani abu da zai iya canza komai.
This is one.	Wannan shine daya.
She can do two, three years.	Za ta iya yin shekaru biyu, uku.
It is not known why we do any kind of work.	Ba a san dalilin da ya sa muke yin kowane irin aiki ba.
I was so wrong.	Na yi kuskure sosai.
With children.	Tare da yara.
He looks at the water.	Yana kallon ruwan.
I thought he would come and talk to me.	Ina tsammanin zai zo ya yi magana da ni.
There is truth to this.	Akwai gaskiya akan wannan.
He wanted to be told what to do.	Ya so a gaya masa abin da zai yi.
I made him die in the best possible way.	Na sa shi ya mutu a hanya mafi kyau.
I look fine.	Na duba lafiya.
Maybe she's sick of all the lies.	Watakila ta yi rashin lafiya ga duk karya.
Everything is still there.	Komai yana nan har yanzu.
She told him everything.	Ta gaya masa komai.
They live, he thought.	Suna rayuwa, ya yi tunani.
This is near.	Wannan ya kusa.
When a dog is scared or in pain it will respond correctly.	Lokacin da kare ya ji tsoro ko jin zafi zai amsa daidai.
We need you to keep working.	Muna buƙatar ku ci gaba da aiki.
If she does one she will not break.	Idan ta yi daya ba za ta karya ba.
I think you're really on something here.	Ina tsammanin da gaske kuna kan wani abu a nan.
No man down there came.	Babu wani mutum a can kasa da ya zo.
She was what he did not need.	Ta kasance abin da ba ya bukata.
We do not need to know.	Ba mu bukatar mu sani.
I know everything about her.	Na san komai game da ita.
Provisional.	Na ɗan lokaci.

Almost a month ago, now.	Kusan wata daya da ya wuce, yanzu.
Let's move on.	Mu ci gaba.

You have to give me something.	Dole ne ku ba ni wani abu.
I do not know what.	Ban san menene ba.

I think that is also a development.	Ina tsammanin hakan ma ci gaba ne.
I can see that happening.	Ina iya ganin hakan yana faruwa.
You will be removed.	Za a cire ku.
I read the story of what is happening here.	Na karanta labarin abin da ke faruwa a nan.
I was released from that job.	An sake ni daga wannan aikin.
It was scary.	Ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
Some carefully.	Wasu a hankali.
I’m not sure if that put him in the game.	Ban tabbata ba idan hakan ya sanya shi cikin wasan.
He has to accept that.	Dole ne ya yarda da hakan.
We will miss the rain.	Za mu rasa ruwan sama.
I worked really hard on that.	Na yi aiki da gaske a kan hakan.
It's fat.	Ya yi mai.
I want to go out	Ina son fita
I don’t remember anyone doing anything great.	Ban tuna wani yayi wani babban abu ba.
The story is here.	Labarin yana nan.
Of course there are other players out there.	Tabbas akwai wasu 'yan wasa a can.
It's not just me.	Ba nawa bane kawai.
Next, get some people to try it out.	Na gaba, sa wasu mutane su gwada shi.
You can and you will.	Za ku iya kuma za ku yi.
Maybe she thinks so.	Watakila tana tunanin hakan.
And she would never forget.	Kuma da ba za ta manta ba.
Now, what lies ahead is very good.	Yanzu, abin da ke gaba yana da kyau sosai.
She should be fine.	Ya kamata ta kasance lafiya.
They are watching you.	Suna kallon ku.
Whatever it is.	Duk abin da yake.
Read this carefully before answering.	Karanta wannan a hankali kafin amsa.
I don't know where he can go.	Ban san inda zai iya tafiya ba.
They seem to be planning to save it for a while.	Da alama suna shirin ajiye ta na wani lokaci.
It didn’t stop my surprise.	Ba ta daina ban mamaki na ba.
There is no water.	Ruwan ruwa babu kowa.
It's a pleasure for me.	Abin farin ciki ne a gare ni.
Please help me with this.	Don Allah a taimake ni da wannan.
But remember, we don’t have much time.	Amma ku tuna, ba mu da lokaci mai yawa.
And finally you get what you want.	Kuma a ƙarshe kuna samun abin da kuke so.
They lived well and ate well.	Sun zauna lafiya kuma sun ci abinci sosai.
It is always on the same page.	Kullum yana kan wani wuri.
This restaurant still operates today.	Wannan gidan cin abinci yana aiki har yau.
Two opportunities did not.	Biyu dama ba su yi ba.
And he was not the only one to suffer.	Kuma ba shi kaɗai ke shan wahala ba.
She knows that.	Ta san haka.
Or, not just a game.	Ko kuma, ba kawai wasa ba.
I missed him	na rasa shi
Sleep is good.	Barci yana da kyau.

But he can not.	Amma ba zai iya ba.
It took many years.	Sai da shekaru masu yawa.

No one asked him anything.	Babu wanda ya tambaye shi komai.
They will help him.	Za su taimake shi.
On the way to your kid.	A kan hanyar ku yaro.
There are many things that need to be fixed.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ya kamata a gyara su.
No one was able to say anything.	Babu kuma wanda ya sami damar cewa komai.
We have to work now.	Dole ne mu yi aiki a yanzu.
You don’t want me to have anything of my own.	Ba ku so in sami wani abu na kaina.
I did well, though.	Na yi kyau, ko da yake.
I can't swim.	Ba zan iya yin iyo ba.
But they continued.	Amma sun ci gaba.
It rained day and night.	An yi ruwan sama dare da rana.
He sat there waiting, not knowing what to say.	Ya zauna yana jira, bai san me zai ce ba.
No, now everyone is using it.	A'a, yanzu kowa yana amfani da shi.
They bought a car a few years ago.	Sun sayi mota shekaru kadan da suka wuce.
She is too.	Ita ce kuma.
She agreed to have lunch with him.	Ta yarda ta ci abincin rana da shi.
It took a while.	Ya ɗauki ɗan lokaci.
Not surprisingly, this time.	Ba abin mamaki ba, wannan lokacin.
You cut me very thin.	Kun yanke ni sosai.
Without them, this would not have happened.	Ba tare da su ba, da hakan bai faru ba.
I know that very well.	Na san hakan da kyau.
She can make it work.	Ta iya sa ta yi aiki.
The house has been completely renovated.	An gyara gidan gaba daya.
Is there anything you can do about it?	Ko akwai wani abu da za ku iya yi game da hakan?
He didn't really have time to read the article.	Ba shi da lokacin karanta labarin da gaske.
I make someone check if you go.	Na sa mutum ya duba idan ka tafi.
There seems to be no real answer.	Kamar babu amsa ta gaske.
Maybe that would be a surprise.	Wataƙila wannan zai zama abin ban mamaki.
We will continue the work.	Za mu ci gaba da aikin.
It was amazing.	Ya zama abin ban mamaki.
There is one problem, though.	Akwai matsala ɗaya, ko da yake.
It's too hot in the room.	Yayi zafi a dakin.
Maybe they will.	Wataƙila za su yi shi.
It seems to me that this is the real fear.	Ga alama a gare ni wannan shine ainihin tsoro.
He shouldn't have come, he thought.	Bai kamata ya zo ba, yana tunani.
Had we talked about the game.	Da mun yi magana game da wasan.
I have to remember who did it to him again.	Dole ne in tuna wanda ya yi masa haka kuma.
You could say that.	Kuna iya cewa.
We have to put girls in school.	Dole ne mu sa 'yan mata a makaranta.
This is exactly what he wants.	Wannan shi ne ainihin abin da yake so.
I was amazed this way.	Na yi mamakin wannan hanya.
The children have grown up.	Yara sun girma.
She made a mistake again.	Ta sake yin kuskure.
Are you going to get married?	Shin za ku yi aure?
Is this the best way?	Shin wannan shine mafi kyawun hanya?
Nothing was ever enough.	Babu wani abu da ya taɓa isa.
If you keep making money, you will get it.	Idan kuna da ci gaba da samun kuɗi, za ku samu.
That sounds like a mistake.	Hakan ya zama kamar kuskure.
When it did, we did not receive an immediate response.	Lokacin da ya yi, ba mu sami amsa nan take ba.
I have money	Ina da kudi
I'll start making some calls in the morning.	Zan fara yin wasu kira da safe.
It fits as described.	Ya dace kamar yadda aka bayyana.
I never liked children.	Ban taba son yara ba.
There is no such person.	Babu irin wannan mutumin.
Critics are not happy.	Masu suka ba su ji daɗi ba.
We need to recognize it, and see what can be done.	Muna bukatar mu gane shi, kuma mu ga abin da za a iya yi.
Do not worry about it.	Kar ku damu da shi.
And there is nothing you can do about it.	Kuma babu wani abu da za ku iya yi game da shi.
You may not be able to do it yourself.	Wataƙila ba za ku iya yin shi da kanku ba.
You want to talk to me, you did not come here.	Kuna so ku yi magana da ni, ba ku zo nan ba.
About time again.	Game da lokaci kuma.
Not for nothing.	Ba don komai ba.
Kids have access to it, and that’s a problem.	Yara suna da damar yin amfani da shi, kuma wannan matsala ce.
That has always been the way, though.	Ko da yaushe hakan ya kasance hanya, ko da yake.
If you want to do that, fine.	Idan kuna son yin hakan, lafiya.
Often.	Sau da yawa.
You can not pay me more.	Ba za ku iya biya ni ƙarin ba.
She had time to do it.	Ta samu lokacin yin hakan.
To enter here he must have one.	Don shiga nan dole ne ya sami daya.
Please help me to see what the problem is if you can.	Don Allah a taimake ni in ga menene matsalar idan za ku iya.
This is a great feeling.	Wannan babban ji ne.
I was late, but I got a lot of help.	Na makara, amma na sami taimako sosai.
She wanted to leave, but she could not.	Ta so ta tafi, amma ta kasa.
She was alone in the house with him.	Ita kadai a gidan tare da shi.
He could not let that happen again.	Ba zai iya barin hakan ta sake faruwa ba.
They kept walking away from him.	Suka ci gaba da tafiya daga gare shi.
However this will always be the case.	Duk da haka wannan zai kasance koyaushe.
Can you help me more?	Za ku iya ƙara taimaka mini.
It’s a lot faster than running for me.	Yana da yawa fiye da gudu a gare ni.
Let's get them to do it.	Bari mu sa su yi da shi.
You just made a mistake.	Kun yi kuskure kawai.
It is not a difficult thing.	Ba abu ne mai wahala ba.
I have nothing	Ba ni da komai
As you hear.	Da ka ji.
Just go inside.	Kawai ku shiga ciki.
They have no children.	Ba su da 'ya'ya.
You did not eat.	Ba ku ci abinci ba.
It is something to be seen.	Abu ne da za a gani.
He took the book.	Ya dauki littafin.
It's a good game !.	Yana da kyau game!.
But the problem is, there are people on the road.	Amma matsalar ita ce, akwai mutane a hanya.
Stop smoking.	A daina shan taba.
That's how he realized it.	Haka ya gane hakan.
But you seem to be not happy about that.	Amma ka ga kamar ba ka jin daɗin hakan.
You must do this before leaving.	Dole ne ku yi haka kafin ku bar wurin.
I know who this is.	Na san wanene wannan.
But that just started talking.	Amma wannan kawai ya fara magana.
He saw nothing.	Bai ga komai ba.
So time is not necessarily my thing.	Don haka lokaci ba lallai bane abu na bane.
I see you as yourself.	Ina ganin ku kamar kanku.
On the way, the cold rain came back.	A hanya, ruwan sama mai sanyi ya dawo.
They went up and down to make sure the weekend went well.	Sun yi sama da sama don tabbatar da cewa karshen mako ya yi kyau.
I still haven't bought it.	Har yanzu ban saya ba.
Get out of this, you.	Ka fita daga wannan, kai.
I was amazed at how fast time moved.	Na yi mamakin yadda lokaci ya yi sauri.
Since then no one has been involved.	Tun daga nan babu wanda ya shiga ciki.
Now we get the truth.	Yanzu muna samun gaskiya.
That worked really well, but after that, it didn't work out well.	Wannan ya yi kyau sosai, amma bayan haka, bai yi kyau ba.
Close but not the last.	Kusa amma ba na ƙarshe ba.
You can put your head next to mine.	Kuna iya sanya kan ku kusa da nawa.
So he said somehow.	Don haka yace ko yaya.
They could not find one.	Sun kasa samun daya.
No one knows anything.	Babu wanda ya san komai.
And often, they will not.	Kuma sau da yawa, ba za su yi ba.
He did not run.	Bai gudu ba.
This is not for us.	Wannan ba mu bane.
Nice to talk to you.	Yayi kyau magana da ku.
That is fine.	Abin da yake da lafiya.
So everything changed.	Don haka komai ya canza.
It was here that he felt he could make a mark.	A nan ne ya ji zai iya yin alama.
I just want you to be with us, please.	Ina so kawai ku kasance tare da mu, don Allah.
I hope you will.	Ina fata za ku yi.
Maybe even today.	Wataƙila ma a yau.
This cannot continue.	Wannan ba zai iya ci gaba ba.
Since then a little has changed.	Tun daga lokacin kadan ya canza.
You are not really scared.	Ba ka ji tsoro da gaske ba.
She burst into the room.	Ta fad'a cikin d'akin.
I did not hear anything.	Ban ji komai ba.
And we can not.	Kuma ba za mu iya ba.
It is the same with you.	Shi ma haka yake.
They can even make us feel bad.	Har ma suna iya sa mu rashin jin daɗi.
In this room.	A cikin wannan dakin.
It's early though.	Yana da wuri ko da yake.
I am more interested in this.	Na fi sha'awar wannan.
But we do not have it here or any of the others.	Amma ba mu da shi a nan ko wani daga cikin sauran.
And so it is.	Kuma shi ma haka ne.
This has never been the case.	Ba haka yake ba a da.
Progress is allowed.	Ana ba da damar ci gaba.
He can't wait until we get out.	Ba zai iya jira sai mun fita ba.
This is nothing new now.	Wannan ba sabon abu bane yanzu.
He is an amazing player.	Shi dan wasa ne mai ban mamaki.
But that cannot be.	Amma hakan ba zai iya zama ba.
This is a surprise.	Wannan abin mamaki ne.
One more thing he did not understand.	Wani abu daya kuma bai gane ba.
You get it right.	Kuna samun shi mai kyau.
They will not later.	Ba za su daga baya ba.
It was at this time that a lawsuit was filed.	A dai-dai lokacin ne aka yi wata kara.
This dog is scary.	Wannan kare yana da ban tsoro.
We feel that something is wrong here.	Mun ji cewa wani abu ba daidai ba a nan.
They were waiting for us.	Sun kasance suna jiran mu.
Big mistake.	Babban kuskure.
You need to know what that is.	Kuna buƙatar sanin menene hakan.
But that is not enough.	Amma wannan bai isa ba.
Even then he did not go out.	Ko a lokacin bai fita ba.
No speech.	Babu magana.
It's good to hear it too.	Yana da kyau a ji shi ma.
I tried to cry but it hurt.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin kuka amma hakan ya yi zafi.
She is not said to have us there.	Ba a ce tana da mu a wurin ba.
It's hard to see him go.	Yana da wuya a ga ya tafi.
I never liked anyone.	Ban taba son kowa ba.
I want you to be with me.	Ina so ku kasance tare da ni.
The first thing you do is think you are going to die.	Abu na farko da za ku yi shi ne tunanin za ku mutu.
He did not say.	Bai fad'a ba.
So you have to play your best.	Don haka dole ne ku yi wasa da mafi kyawun ku.
Earlier you said you came here to die.	Tun da farko ka ce ka zo nan don ka mutu.
I can walk by myself.	Zan iya tafiya da kaina.
Na san ni.	Na san ni.
So be it.	Haka ya kasance.
Give it and it will be better.	Ka ba shi kuma ya fi kyau.
The wait time is fast approaching.	Lokacin jira ya wuce da sauri.
It's a human way.	Hanyar mutum ce.
She would not know how to use it.	Ba za ta san yadda za ta yi amfani da shi ba.
He will recognize early.	Zai gane da wuri.
This is true.	Wannan gaskiya ne.
I use them often.	Ina amfani da su sau da yawa.
Get out of here.	Fita a ciki.
With someone it may be one of those things.	Tare da wani yana iya zama ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan.
I worked a lot.	Na yi aiki da yawa.
She was like that.	Ta kasance irin wannan.
They want to run.	Suna son gudu.
And we are not going to call the police.	Kuma ba za mu kira 'yan sanda ba.
So is the world.	Haka duniya take.
He could not remember the time, or why.	Ya kasa tuna lokacin, ko me yasa.
I need help	Ina neman taimako
Of course, they did not go out at all.	Tabbas, ba su fita gaba ɗaya ba.
Maybe I will agree with you.	Wataƙila zan yarda da ku.
Intelligence can take people by now.	Hankali na iya ɗaukar mutane zuwa yanzu.
They decide what is real and what is not.	Suna yanke shawarar abin da ke na gaske da abin da ba shi ba.
You will never find someone who loves everything you want.	Ba za ku taɓa samun wanda ke son duk abin da kuke so ba.
Without any of your efforts.	Ba tare da wani ƙoƙari na ku ba.
It should be difficult to digest, use.	Ya kamata wahala a ciki, amfani.
I can't see.	Ba zan iya gani ba.
I should have been injured like that.	Ya kamata in yi rauni kamar haka.
And they enjoyed it.	Kuma sun ji daɗi game da shi.
I'm not said to be driving here.	Ba a ce ina tuƙi a nan ba.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution.	Ya zuwa yanzu babu wanda zai iya.
He is a whole person.	Wani mutum ne gaba ɗaya.
He plays and plays.	Yana wasa da wasa.
Then I started defending myself.	Daga nan na fara kare kaina.
I am not afraid.	Ba ni da tsoro.
I use it all the time !.	Ina amfani da shi koyaushe!.
Make sure everything is correct.	Tabbatar cewa komai yayi daidai.
Does it really look like that?	Shin da gaske haka yake kama?
Could not find out how.	An kasa gano yadda.
It gives me some benefit.	Yana ba ni ɗan amfani.
Two are at work, with perhaps others standing.	Biyu suna kan aiki, tare da watakila wasu sun tsaya.
And no one should be killed.	Kuma kada a kashe kowa.
No one came to her.	Ba wanda ya zo mata.
No, you will not have time to bring anything.	A'a, ba za ku sami lokacin kawo komai ba.
I have no say in that.	Ba ni da wata magana a kan hakan.
He has done this twice before.	Ya taba yin haka sau biyu a baya.
And stop trying too hard.	Kuma ku daina ƙoƙari sosai.
You can check out this article.	Kuna iya duba wannan labarin.
And we do.	Kuma muna yi.
And you know us.	Kuma ka san mu.
He keeps walking.	Yana ci gaba da tafiya.
After a while he was sure he would make a mistake.	Bayan ɗan lokaci ya tabbata cewa zai sami kuskure.
The second time he does.	A karo na biyu yana yi.
Eventually the mind won.	A ƙarshe hankali ya ci nasara.
But this is not common.	Amma wannan ba na kowa bane.
I hope you are happy.	Ina fatan kuna farin ciki.
National assistance is good.	Taimakon kasa yana da kyau.
But as you said, it is a journey.	Amma kamar yadda kuka ce, tafiya ce.
She remembers that very well.	Ta tuna da haka sosai.
It should be open.	Ya kamata ya kasance a bude.
He could not do that.	Ya kasa yin hakan.
You are sleeping now.	Kuna barci yanzu.
But she wants one.	Amma tana son daya.
Is there a.	Akwai wani.
I never, never thought you would.	Ban taba, taba tunanin za ku yi ba.
Not women.	Ba mata ba.
I can't even eat.	Ba ni ma iya ci.
This is where you are needed.	A nan ne ake buƙatar ku.
So, you know, you are amazing.	Don haka, ka sani, kana da ban mamaki.
I trust you and I understand that they work very well.	Na yarda da ku kuma na fahimci cewa suna aiki sosai.
She checked the time.	Ta duba lokaci.
He was very close.	Ya kasance kusa sosai.
He decided to take a strange path.	Ya yanke shawarar ɗaukar hanya ta ban mamaki.
First, it is too cold to swim.	Na farko, yana da sanyi da yawa don yin iyo.
I love how happy she is.	Ina son irin farin cikin da take samu.
That should be sufficient enough.	Wannan ya isa daidai.
I think maybe it is.	Ina tsammanin watakila ita ce.
He will be there again this year.	Zai sake zuwa can a bana.
Many people are obsessed with this.	Mutane da yawa sun damu da wannan.
But no one is around.	Amma babu wani da yake kusa.
It requires one to know one.	Yana bukatar mutum ya san daya.
We lost everything.	Mun rasa komai.
I tell you he may die.	Ina gaya muku watakila ya mutu.
They feel like talking.	Suka ji kamar suna faɗa.
We want to get some of it.	Muna son samun wasu daga ciki.
That's why we want to live.	Shi ya sa muke son rayuwa.
Closely.	A hankali.
A loud cry can be heard.	Ana iya jin kuka mai sauri.
He could not speak of a way out of this.	Ya kasa magana hanyar fita daga wannan.
They asked me what happened?	Suka tambaye ni me ya faru?
I didn’t think it would really go away.	Ban yi tsammanin za ta tafi da gaske ba.
We do everything together.	Muna yin komai tare.
I'm sure there is nothing there.	Na tabbata babu komai a wurin.
And so we finish it.	Kuma haka za mu gama shi.
You will not be touched.	Ba za ku taba ku ba.
He does not need to.	Ba ya bukata.
He decided to stay.	Ya yanke shawarar ya zauna.
Real game.	Wasan gaske.
We would have been in trouble otherwise.	Da mun shiga matsala idan ba haka ba.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Say you will.	Ka ce za ka yi.
We do not want to take any chances.	Ba ma so mu yi wani dama.
When it was time for work, we worked.	Lokacin da lokacin aiki ya yi, mun yi aiki.
This is a good idea.	Wannan kyakkyawan tunani ne.
I can't go without food.	Ba zan iya tafiya ba tare da cin abinci ba.
It was more than that.	Ya kasance fiye da haka.
First good.	Na farko mai kyau.
It will be a good time !.	Za a yi kyau lokaci!.
This will tell you if you will be safe.	Wannan zai gaya muku ko za ku kasance lafiya.
I wanted to do it.	Na so in yi.
And grow, too.	Kuma girma, ma.
Nothing great, nothing great.	Babu wani abu mai girma, babu wani abu mai girma.
Try and prove.	Gwada kuma tabbatar.
Here is my.	Ga nawa.
He said to bring one person.	Yace a kawo mutum daya.
Not for the first time.	Ba karo na farko ba.
He had known the owner for thirty years.	Ya taba sanin mai shi shekaru talatin.
When he returned home he did not stay long.	Da ya dawo gida bai dade da zama ba.
Sometimes even before you die, that's it.	Wani lokaci ma kafin ka mutu, shi ke nan.
It is done.	Ana yi.
I would never expect that from anyone.	Ba zan taba yi wa kowa fatan haka ba.
I hope you understand.	Ina fatan kun gane.
Do not use too much oil.	Kada a yi amfani da mai da yawa.
Not so, but it certainly will try.	Ko ba haka ba, amma tabbas za ta gwada.
She can do nothing.	Ba za ta iya yin komai ba.
The station is close to the train station.	Tashar tana kusa da tashar jirgin kasa.
Check it out again, if you don't agree with me.	Duba shi kuma, idan ba ku yarda da ni ba.
There is no seating.	Babu wurin zama.
That made me a little upset.	Hakan ya dan bata min rai.
You are great.	Kai mai girma ne.
I refuse to sell it.	Na ƙi sayar da shi.
She was not surprised.	Ba ta yi mamaki ba.
It's too cold in the palace.	An yi sanyi a fada.
To be honest.	Don gaskiya da gaske.
Hard to say.	Ya yi wuya a iya faɗa.
Maybe he will grow up without hating you.	Wataƙila zai girma ba tare da ya ƙi ku ba.
Sometimes the one who is more playful can fail.	Wani lokaci wanda ya fi wasa zai iya yin rashin nasara.
It was just tested on almost everything.	An gwada kawai game da komai.
We still have it.	Har yanzu muna da shi.
So it must have been in the past.	Don haka tabbas ya kasance a baya.
She does not know where she is.	Bata san inda take ba.
You will pay for this.	Za ku biya wannan.
But maybe it is true.	Amma watakila gaskiya ne.
And about that.	Kuma game da wannan.
Help us help you !.	Taimaka mana taimake ku!.
However, there is a problem with this.	Duk da haka, akwai matsala game da wannan.
She needs to stay, because she is sick.	Tana bukatar ta zauna, saboda bata da lafiya.
I will not enter the road.	Ba zan shiga hanya ba.
You will buy, buy, buy.	Za ku saya, saya, saya.
Everything really triggers this.	Komai da gaske yana kunna wannan.
It's eleven o'clock.	Karfe sha daya na dare.
She wanted to wait.	Ta so ta jira.
But we have a lot of time together.	Amma muna da lokaci mai yawa tare.
She is, in fact.	Ita ce, a gaskiya.
And we are here to stay.	Kuma muna nan don zama.
He has been there a long time.	Ya dade a wurin.
The unhappiness of growing up was obvious.	Rashin jin daɗin girma ya kasance mai iya gani.
Quickly he thought.	Da sauri ya yi tunani.
That is why we run away from him.	Shi ya sa muka gudu daga gare shi.
So far, it has not been impressive.	Ya zuwa yanzu, bai kasance mai ban sha'awa ba.
We can't take that.	Ba za mu iya ɗaukar wannan ba.
She will drink one glass of water.	Zata sha ruwa guda daya.
We'll see more tomorrow.	Za mu kara ganin gobe akan hakan.
The house is small.	Gidan kadan ne.
Way.	Hanya.
Like nothing happened.	Kamar babu abin da ya faru.
This is certainly true.	Wannan tabbas gaskiya ne.
They became great in the end.	Sun zama mai girma a ƙarshe.
He heard.	Ya ji.
I know what you want.	Na san abin da kuke so.
There are so many.	Akwai da yawa.
We heard about it.	Mun ji labarin haka.
He came up with a little to show it.	Ya zo da kadan don nuna shi.
They said the meeting was wrong.	Sun ce taron ya yi kuskure.
I want to talk to you.	Ina so in yi magana da ku.
You know what they are.	Kun san abin da suke.
He left her.	Da ya bar ta.
We ate three meals together.	Muna cin abinci guda uku tare.
They do not hurt.	Ba sa jin zafi.
We think he killed it.	Muna tsammanin ya kashe shi.
Maybe we can do something.	Watakila sai mu iya yin wani abu.
Such talk was given to us.	Irin wannan magana da aka yi mana.
That is the end of my speech.	Karshen magana na kenan.
We are entering.	Muna shiga.
It's one of those things.	Yana daya daga cikin abubuwan.
You’re going with the right thing.	Kuna tafiya da abin da ya dace.
The plane was found.	An gano jirgin da.
Some are mine.	Wasu nawa ne.
I'm sure someone will reach him.	Na tabbata wani zai isa gare shi.
Of course they said.	Tabbas sun ce.
Turn on the water slowly.	Kunna ruwan a hankali.
I need to work on these extras.	Ina bukata in yi aiki a kan waɗannan ƙarin.
I'll be back in time.	Zan dawo a lokacin.
I haven't found it yet.	Ban samu ba tukuna.
I am this person.	Ni ne wannan mutumin.
Eventually, she would go.	A ƙarshe, za ta tafi.
It's really hot to get.	Yana da gaske zafi samu.
And they wonder why.	Kuma suka yi mamakin dalilin da ya sa.
Maybe she doesn't even know it.	Wataƙila ita ma ba ta san hakan ba.
Everyone knows everyone.	Kowa ya san kowa.
Many died.	Mutane da yawa sun mutu.
But that did not really happen.	Amma da gaske hakan bai faru ba.
He is with us.	Yana nan tare da mu.
I always have a job with me.	Kullum ina da wani aiki tare da ni.
No one hears.	Ba wanda yake ji.
It's amazing.	Abin mamaki ne.
I feel so good.	Na ji dadi sosai.
We want you to grow up.	Muna son ku girma.
There is fear.	Akwai tsoro.
He wanted to use it.	Ya so yayi amfani da ita.
I think both are true.	Ina ganin duka gaskiya ne.
What did you do?	Me kuka yi.
It is better to put someone in it.	Gara saka wani a ciki.
Give me life.	Ka ba ni rai.
But again, that would take time.	Amma kuma, hakan zai ɗauki lokaci.
And no one did anything about it.	Kuma babu wanda ya yi wani abu game da shi.
It hurts.	Yana jin zafi.
He went and was never found.	Ya tafi kuma ba a gano shi ba.
Only a few are interested.	Kadan ne kawai ke sha'awar.
A police officer spoke to the suspect.	Wani dan sanda yayi magana da wanda ake zargin.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
Things are not like that anymore.	Abubuwa ba haka suke ba kuma.
One at most.	Daya a mafi yawan.
Make time for it.	Yi lokaci don shi.
Sometimes life is in the room.	Wani lokaci rai yana cikin dakin.
Let us hear.	Ka sa mu ji magana.
We can't have one without you.	Ba za mu iya samun ɗaya ba tare da ku ba.
But everyone decided to keep going.	Amma kowa ya yanke shawarar ci gaba da tafiya.
Like the world.	Kamar duniya.
Try this book.	Gwada wannan littafin.
Surprisingly,	Abin mamaki,
We think it works well.	Muna tsammanin yana aiki da kyau.
They felt it hadn’t changed much.	Sun ji bai canza sosai ba.
All in all, it failed.	Duk daya, ya kasa.
All of you.	Duk ku.
Of course he is there.	Tabbas yana can.
Maybe you are.	Wataƙila kai ne.
The journey was slow and difficult.	Tafiya ta kasance a hankali da wahala.
The journey is too much for you.	Tafiya ta yi maka yawa.
I really, really, really hope so.	Ina gaske, da gaske, fatan haka .
You will not understand.	Ba za ku fahimci hakan ba.
You can be.	Kuna iya zama.
You can always talk to me.	Kuna iya magana da ni koyaushe.
I agree, kids just need play.	Na yarda, yara kawai suna buƙatar wasa.
No one was surprised in the story.	Babu wanda ya yi mamaki a cikin labarin.
You get a plane.	Kuna samun jirgin sama.
So far, nothing.	Ya zuwa yanzu, babu komai.
You have some tomorrow.	Kuna da wasu gobe.
She understands whether.	Ta gane ko.
You have to hurry, but not fast.	Dole ne ku yi sauri, amma ba da sauri ba.
It is enough for all of us.	Yana isa gare mu duka.
She always thought so but now she is convinced.	Kullum haka take tunani amma yanzu ta tabbata.
Maybe they didn’t.	Wataƙila ba su yi ba.
Here is one simple thing you can do.	Ga abu ɗaya mai sauƙi da za ku iya yi.
But surely time will tell !.	Amma tabbas lokaci zai nuna!.
That's how it started.	Haka aka fara.
You can't be found.	Ba za a iya samun ku ba.
I have to learn life.	Dole ne in koyi rayuwa.
He knew her just as he did not know others.	Ya san ta kamar yadda bai san wasu ba.
He had never felt so sad.	Bai taba jin bakin ciki haka ba.
The man did not stop.	Mutumin bai daina ba.
Both were injured but should be safe.	Biyu sun ji rauni amma ya kamata su lafiya.
He will do it for us.	Zai yi mana.
He is known for his intelligence.	An san shi da hankali.
He shouldn’t have to pay much attention.	Bai kamata ya kula sosai ba.
They left immediately.	Nan take suka tafi.
They went to a nearby restaurant.	Sun je wani gidan abinci kusa da nan.
I did not realize that there were other people there.	Ban gane cewa akwai sauran mutane a wurin ba.
Everything a person is good.	Duk abin da mutum yana da kyau.
Now let's see what I found.	Yanzu bari mu ga abin da na samu.
This takes more work than what has happened so far.	Wannan yana ɗaukar aiki fiye da abin da ya faru har zuwa yanzu.
He is surprised now.	Ya yi mamaki yanzu.
And that did not make her mistake.	Kuma hakan bai sa ta kuskure ba.
It uses what it already has.	Yana yin amfani da abin da ya riga ya kasance.
It really adds up.	Da gaske yana ƙara sama.
It's over.	Ya wuce.
But that is what we are called.	Amma abin da aka kira mu ke nan.
That is not enough yet.	Wannan bai isa ba tukuna.
I do not want to grow up.	Ba na son girma.
Not just today.	Ba yau kawai ba.
Find out where they are.	Gano inda suke.
No one is very happy.	Babu mai farin ciki sosai.
I am not afraid.	Ban ma tsoro ba.
Maybe even a year.	Wataƙila ko da shekara guda.
I wondered if it was the same.	Na yi tunanin ko shi daya ne.
I had a good time.	Na sami lokaci mai kyau.
Maybe tomorrow will come.	Watakila gobe zata zo.
There are some driving to be done tomorrow.	Akwai wasu tuƙi da za a yi gobe.
And it's almost time.	Kuma ya kusa lokaci.
She did us a good job here.	Ta yi mana kyau a nan.
It was the right decision for me.	Shi ne shawarar da ta dace a gare ni.
Everything should come together slowly.	Komai ya kamata ya fito tare a hankali.
It's good.	Yana da kyau.
It makes me hate it.	Yana sa na ƙi shi.
That must be it.	Dole ne hakan ya kasance.
No one agreed to give the money.	Babu wanda ya yarda ya ba da kuɗin.
Nothing really happened.	Babu wani abu da ya faru da gaske.
No more need to be said.	Babu sauran bukatar a ce.
Here are a few of our favorites.	Ga kadan daga cikin abubuwan da muka fi so.
Then they come back to me.	Daga nan sai su dawo gare ni.
She should have known better.	Ya kamata ta fi sani.
He lit a cigarette.	Ya kunna taba.
So how things will be.	Don haka yadda abubuwa za su kasance.
Nothing was done.	Ba komai aka yi.
Somehow he got involved.	Ko ta yaya ya shiga.
And what work.	Kuma wane aiki.
Don't listen.	Kada ku ji.
It will not prove anything.	Ba zai tabbatar da komai ba.
Get up here.	Tashi nan.
She knew it, but she was still waiting outside.	Ta san haka, amma har yanzu tana jira a waje.
She has no children.	Ba ta da 'ya'ya.
But we plan to change that.	Amma muna shirin canza wannan.
She is.	Ita ce.
It will take some time, though.	Zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci, ko da yake.
They were just amazing.	Sun kasance masu ban mamaki kawai.
But sometimes she doesn’t stop to think why.	Amma wani lokacin ba ta tsaya tunanin dalilin ba.
But of course nothing has ever been really new.	Amma ba shakka babu abin da ya taɓa zama sabon gaske.
I do not understand.	Ban gane ba.
And that should be easy.	Kuma wannan ya zama mai sauƙi.
You read everything.	Kuna karanta komai.
This was amazing.	Wannan ya kasance abin ban mamaki.
There are, of course, many.	Akwai, ba shakka, da yawa.
Above all.	Sama da yawa.
The house is nice and cozy.	Gidan yana da kyau da dadi.
I was like	Na kasance kamar
That surprised her.	Abin ya ba ta mamaki.
The door is closed.	An rufe kofar.
I think we have had a chance to win this year.	Ina tsammanin mun sami damar yin nasara a wannan shekara.
And we run with it.	Kuma muna gudu da shi.
You must feel the pain.	Dole ne ku ji zafi.
He could not live without it.	Ba zai iya zama ba tare da shi ba.
How is she?	Tana da yaya.
Not at this time of year.	Ba a wannan lokacin na shekara ba.
He used to drink.	Ya kasance yana sha.
I'll be careful.	Zan yi hankali.
But now everything has changed.	Amma yanzu komai ya canza.
He did not know if she had heard.	Bai san ko ta ji ba.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
They do not eat.	Ba sa cin abinci.
He knows what you need.	Ya san abin da kuke bukata.
I want to help you.	Ina so in taimake ku.
Reading this is very interesting.	Karanta wannan yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
But others can.	Amma wasu suna iya.
When the bus departs, look for the right route.	Lokacin da bas ɗin ya tashi, nemi hanya mai kyau.
I like them a lot.	Ina son su da yawa.
Just for this event.	Kawai don wannan taron.
I don't know him very well.	Ban san shi da kyau ba.
Must go.	Dole ne a tafi.
I played.	Na yi wasa.
Because I didn't get it.	Don ban samu ba.
I really wouldn’t.	Da gaske ba zan yi ba.
He was in a fight.	Ya kasance cikin fada.
However, they never got as much water as they paid for.	Duk da haka, ba su taba samun ruwa mai yawa kamar yadda suka biya ba.
They do not want to hear.	Ba sa son ji.
And you will be too.	Kuma za ku kasance ma.
He explained that he could not help it.	Ya bayyana cewa ba zai iya taimaka masa ba.
It is not the time that brings us to this.	Ba lokacin da shi ne ya kawo mu ga wannan ba.
And about time.	Kuma game da lokaci.
Just a little sweet.	Dan dadi kawai.
She did not expect this answer.	Ba ta yi tsammanin wannan amsa ba.
It was, above all, a thrill.	Ya kasance, fiye da komai, abin sha'awa.
I love them back.	Ina son su baya.
It is, in fact, weak.	Yana da, a gaskiya, rauni.
But we can't get that.	Amma ba za mu iya samun hakan ba.
It is only for you.	Abin sani kawai a gare ku.
It can be both.	Yana iya zama duka biyu.
Have you finished your homework yet?	Kun gama aikin gida tukuna?
Nothing and nothing.	Babu komai kuma komai.
Just go somewhere else.	Kawai je wani wuri kuma.
Tell me what you want me to be.	Faɗa min abin da kuke so in zama.
I think we can be better.	Ina tsammanin za mu iya zama mafi kyau.
He returned home at the age of two.	Sai da ya kai shekara biyu ya dawo gida.
Surprisingly, it worked.	Abin mamaki, ya yi aiki.
Hope to come back.	Da fatan za a dawo.
You are there, you are here.	Kuna can, ku ma kuna nan.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba abin mamaki ba ne.
Not a little.	Ba kadan ba.
The angle is the object.	A kwana shi ne abu.
The man paid for it but was skeptical.	Mutumin ya biya shi amma ya yi shakka.
And we are not dead.	Kuma ba mu mutu ba.
Otherwise, it still works fine.	In ba haka ba, har yanzu yana aiki da kyau.
We live close to the inside and outside of the workplace.	Mun zama kusa da ciki da waje wurin aiki.
And keep watching how you get involved.	Kuma ku ci gaba da duba yadda kuke shiga.
That is a fact.	Wannan gaskiya ce.
But it does not work for me.	Amma ba ya aiki a gare ni.
I will know if you tell him.	Zan sani idan ka gaya masa.
Every day is an opportunity to work.	Kowace rana dama ce ta yin aiki.
Some did little, some little.	Wasu sun yi kadan kadan, wasu kadan kadan.
Food was what was needed.	Abinci ya kasance abin da ake bukata.
However, not everything is going well.	Duk da haka, ba komai ke tafiya ba.
Everyone is fine.	Kowa yana lafiya.
Growth happens because you look and go beyond what you know.	Girma yana faruwa ne saboda ka duba kuma ka wuce abin da ka sani.
Anyone before that and it can be cool for them.	Duk wani kafin wannan kuma yana iya zama sanyi a gare su.
So people are dead, they are dead.	Don haka mutane sun mutu, sun mutu.
It's just fun.	Abin sha'awa ne kawai.
He plays very well.	Yana wasa sosai.
They continue this process for a while.	Suna ci gaba da wannan hanya na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
You add here, they see there.	Kuna ƙara a nan, suna gani a can.
So it was difficult.	Don haka ya yi wuya.
Work on something.	Yi aiki da wani abu.
There is nothing to write about.	Babu wani abu da za a rubuta a kansa.
I became better.	Na zama mafi kyau.
It is not very difficult but it is not easy.	Ba shi da wahala sosai amma ba shi da sauƙi.
He will make sure to make her day.	Zai tabbatar da yin rana ta.
The future is there.	Gaba yana can.
Then the world came to him because they needed food.	Sai duniya ta zo masa don suna bukatar abinci.
There he stayed where he was.	Nan ya zauna a inda ya saba.
They made me.	Sun yi min.
Do not go too early.	Kada ku tafi da wuri.
What you remember will change you.	Abin da kuka tuna zai canza ku.
However, we were not great together.	Duk da haka, ba mu kasance mai girma tare ba.
I'll just do it.	Zan yi haka kawai.
But not life.	Amma ba rai ba.
I just want everything about it.	Ina son komai game da shi kawai.
There is a house	Akwai gida
Tonight at dinner.	Yau da dare a wurin abincin dare.
I'm sure I checked that out.	Na tabbata na duba hakan.
They want to be happy.	Suna so su yi farin ciki.
It is easy not to discover things, if you try very hard.	Yana da sauƙi kada ku gano abubuwa, idan kun yi ƙoƙari sosai.
I see, however, that you.	Na ga, duk da haka, cewa ku.
Check out my other stuff.	Duba sauran abubuwa na.
This is what should happen.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya kamata ya faru.
Hopefully your dog will be left at home.	Da fatan za a bar kare ku a gida.
She has since left the program.	Tun daga nan ta bar shirin.
He wanted to tell the man to go and drink something.	Ya so ya ce wa mutumin ya je ya sha wani abu.
But many do not.	Amma da yawa ba sa.
We did not look at each other.	Ba mu kalli juna ba.
It's very interesting.	Yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
Go to the end.	Tafiya zuwa ƙarshe.
I am still the same person.	Ni har yanzu mutumin daya ne.
I never thought of that.	Ban taba tunanin hakan ba.
I suspect you!	Ina zargin ku!
Something caught them.	Wani abu ya kama su.
Go now.	Ku tafi yanzu.
It will still try.	Zai gwada har yanzu.
He walks slowly.	A hankali yake tafiya.
And this is it.	Kuma wannan shi ne.
I do not know if we were at that time yet.	Ban sani ba ko mun kasance a lokacin tukuna.
God gave them a sign.	Allah ya ba su wata alama.
He did nothing wrong.	Bai yi komai daidai ba.
How much is better.	Nawa ya ma fi kyau.
But he was just as he was.	Amma ya kasance kamar yadda yake da shi.
She read the book with interest.	Ta karanta littafin cikin sha'awa.
I am not weak.	Ba ni da rauni.
They are, of course, equal.	Suna, ba shakka, daidai suke.
It is not difficult to find someone.	Ba abu mai wuya a sami wani ba.
They may fear that no one will take care of them.	Suna iya jin tsoron cewa babu wanda zai kula da su.
It covers well.	Ya rufe da kyau.
Still, he was happy.	Duk da haka, ya yi farin ciki.
It's not a game.	Ba wasa ba ne.
Good thing will pass me a month.	Abu mai kyau zai wuce ni wata daya.
So just this once again.	Don haka kawai wannan sau ɗaya kuma.
I want to do everything people do.	Ina so in yi duk abin da mutane suke yi.
I know you trust me.	Na san kun yarda da ni.
This is not a real wedding.	Wannan ba shine ainihin bikin aure ba.
It doesn't matter where you come from.	Ba komai daga ina kuka fito ba.
He said he did not remember.	Yace bai tuna ba.
Everyone wanted to talk one last time.	Kowa ya so yin magana na ƙarshe.
We went weak here.	Mun tafi da rauni a nan.
He does nothing to help.	Ba ya yin wani abu don taimako.
Everything seems to be working fine.	Da alama komai yana aiki lafiya.
I think a mistake must have been made.	Ina ganin dole ne a yi wani kuskure.
Back there.	A can baya.
First, when you do something wrong.	Na ɗaya, lokacin da kuka yi wani abu ba daidai ba.
I can do more than he can.	Zan iya yin hakan fiye da yadda zai iya.
He will do anything for me.	Zai yi min komai.
He got a chance.	Ya samu dama.
Everyone wants that.	Kowa yana son hakan.
We can be safe and we can work at the same time.	Za mu iya kare lafiya kuma muna iya aiki a lokaci guda.
Hear what your doctor says.	Ji abin da likitan ku ya ce.
She had to talk to him.	Dole ta yi masa magana.
They are a little excited.	Suna ɗan jin daɗi.
I usually work at night.	Na saba aiki da dare.
And here’s something you wouldn’t expect to see in such a place.	Kuma ga wani abu da ba za ku yi tsammanin gani a irin wannan wuri ba.
But even that is a problem.	Amma ko da wannan yana da matsala.
The man who died.	Mutumin da ya mutu.
It's an easy task.	Aiki ne mai sauƙi.
He must have known for a while.	Lallai ya sani na ɗan lokaci.
She was running.	Ta na gudu.
We are preparing for you.	Muna shirin muku.
I am accustomed to the truth.	Na saba a gaskiya.
And that needs to be covered.	Kuma akwai buƙatar rufe wannan.
It's been a long time, he heard.	Ya dade, ya ji.
That look is enough to answer.	Wannan kallon ya isa amsa.
Everyone, including myself.	Da kowa, har da kaina.
He is not very happy, but nothing will continue.	Ba shi da farin ciki sosai, amma babu abin da zai ci gaba.
They will tell you something.	Za su gaya muku wani abu.
Some things we don't know yet.	Wasu abubuwan da ba mu sani ba tukuna.
I don’t know again if I did the right thing.	Ban sani ba kuma idan na yi daidai.
We know it will take some time.	Mun san zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
He spoke only one word.	Ya yi magana daya kawai.
Or better yet, take it with you anyway.	Ko mafi kyau har yanzu, ɗauka tare da ku ta wata hanya.
But he still looks like a child.	Amma har yanzu yana kama da yaro.
The three of them got up laughing.	Su uku suka tashi suna dariya.
I'm not sure if any of that is true.	Ban tabbata ko ɗaya daga cikin hakan gaskiya ne ba.
This, too, will pass.	Wannan kuma, zai wuce.
They are looking for an honest person.	Suna neman mutum mai gaskiya.
At the time I did not know her very well.	A lokacin ban san ta sosai ba.
She even treated me well.	Ta ma yi min kyau.
Come with me.	Zo da ni.
Because he did not waste time.	Don bai bata lokaci ba.
People do things.	Mutane suna yin abubuwa.
Sometimes you have to deal with it.	Wani lokaci dole ne ka yi aiki da shi.
We want them to come back with us.	Muna son su dawo tare da mu.
Read carefully you came here to get well.	Karanta a hankali kun zo nan don samun lafiya.
Otherwise you will get a lot of work.	In ba haka ba za ku sami aiki mai yawa.
I went to school.	Na je makaranta.
He had before.	Ya na da kafin.
They stay at home.	Su zauna a gida.
You can hear us all.	Kuna iya jin mu duka.
I can’t let them change you.	Ba zan iya barin su canza ku ba.
It makes me think, though.	Ya sa ni tunani, ko da yake.
And you will be as healthy as you want to be.	Kuma za ku kasance lafiya kamar yadda kuke so ku kasance.
Someone did this to you.	Wani yayi maka wannan.
You can take the car.	Kuna iya ɗaukar motar.
At the same time and it seems to be rising.	A lokaci guda kuma kamar yana tashi.
The house was sold and stopped by a second operation.	An sayar da gidan kuma ya tsaya ta hanyar aiki na biyu.
The man with him is dead.	Mutumin da ke tare da shi ne ya mutu.
It was almost two years ago.	Ya kusan yi shekaru biyu da suka wuce.
Maybe the next trip.	Wataƙila tafiya ta gaba.
But if you want to check it out.	Amma idan kuna son duba shi.
That upset her.	Abin ya bata mata rai.
Best to get some sleep.	Mafi kyawun samun ɗan barci.
This is the coldest time of the year.	Wannan shine lokacin mafi sanyi na shekara.
In fact, they are trying to help her.	A gaskiya ma, suna ƙoƙarin taimaka mata.
Not safe here.	Ba lafiya a nan.
Arrival.	Zuwa.
Amazing job.	Aiki mai ban mamaki.
Even if that was not the case.	Ko da hakan bai kasance ba.
And he did.	Kuma ya yi.
He does not kill him.	Ba ya kashe shi.
I told him no more.	Na ce masa ba za a kara ba.
Do not forget it.	Kar ku manta da shi.
Many want her dead.	Mutane da yawa suna son ta mutu.
But, that is not enough.	Amma, wannan bai isa ba.
There are such people.	Akwai irin wannan mutane.
Wait, now is the time to go.	Jira, yanzu ya yi da za mu tafi.
I think they work here though.	Ina tsammanin suna aiki a nan ko da yake.
Now the problem is.	Yanzu matsalar ita ce.
I walk slowly.	Ina tafiya a hankali.
I hope you succeed tonight.	Ina fatan za ku yi nasara a daren yau.
But two others appeared last night.	Amma wasu biyu sun bayyana a daren jiya.
In the end, they are too big for you.	A ƙarshe, sun yi girma da yawa a gare ku.
Seeing that they could not live without it.	Ganin ba za su iya rayuwa ba tare da shi ba.
Look, it's a big game, let's keep it up.	Duba, babban wasa ne, bari mu ci gaba da shi.
She was even doing it.	Ta kasance har yin hakan.
We agree with that.	Mun yarda da hakan.
I'm fine, really.	Ina lafiya, da gaske.
How much do you like them.	Nawa kuke son su.
Maybe they will give you more.	Wataƙila za su ba ku ƙarin.
I have access to many people.	Ina da damar isa ga mutane da yawa.
The rest almost all went well without him.	Sauran kusan duk suna tafiya lafiya ba tare da shi ba.
Someone has to tell you how things are going.	Dole ne wani ya gaya muku yadda abin ya saba.
No, not crying.	A'a, ba kuka.
Do not tell him.	Kar ku fada masa.
I was very happy, honestly.	Na yi matukar farin ciki, gaskiya.
Do not eat it.	Kada ku ci shi.
I made her write to me.	Na sa ta rubuta min.
It's a little difficult.	Yana ɗan wahala sosai.
So they started.	Haka suka fara.
But there is just no cost for this.	Amma kawai babu kuɗin wannan.
In length.	A tsawon.
They are locked inside.	Sun rufe a ciki.
You take what you can get.	Kuna ɗaukar abin da za ku iya samu.
It is still raining.	Har yanzu ana ruwan sama.
They only tell me what they want me to know.	Abin da suke so in sani kawai suke gaya mani.
The two can work well together.	Biyu na iya yin aiki da kyau tare.
It was an exciting time looking for one.	Sai lokacin ban sha'awa na neman daya.
You should not come here.	Bai kamata ku zo nan ba.
We need to grow, grow and grow.	Muna buƙatar girma, girma da yawa.
Residence.	Wurin zama.
It will be easier.	Zai zama mafi sauƙi.
Sit down with me and talk.	Zauna da ni mu yi magana.
I have to go there.	Dole na je can.
And then everyone will want to see.	Kuma a lokacin kowa zai so ya gani.
Come on, all agreed.	Zo, duk an yarda.
Looks like there's a place for me here.	Kamar akwai wuri a gare ni a nan.
She was a very successful person.	Ta kasance mutum mai nasara sosai.
I don’t care what they think of me.	Ban damu da abin da suke tunani game da ni ba.
But then later.	Amma sai daga baya.
You should do this as soon as possible.	Ya kamata ku yi haka da wuri.
But that is not right.	Amma hakan bai yi daidai ba.
He did not know what to say to her.	Bai san me zai ce mata ba.
This is not a good way right away.	Wannan ba hanya ce mai kyau nan da nan ba.
I think he will play again.	Ina tsammanin zai sake buga wasa.
With no desire to find a home.	Ba tare da wani sha'awar samun gida ba.
So, just head up.	Don haka, kawai kai sama.
He is a man who makes you sad.	Mutum ne wanda ya sa ku damu.
They can be easily identified for what they really are.	Ana iya gano su cikin sauƙi don ainihin abin da suke.
You want to get as good things as you can get them.	Kuna son samun abubuwa masu kyau kamar yadda za ku iya samun su.
He did not want to remember.	Bai so ya tuna ba.
He must know more.	Dole ne ya san ƙarin.
I lost myself and found myself many times.	Na rasa kaina kuma na sami kaina sau da yawa.
It has always been that way.	Ya kasance haka a baya.
No, not at all.	A'a, ba ta yaya.
He could not say anything.	Bai iya cewa komai ba.
Children will die.	Yara za su mutu.
We are all very happy about it.	Mu duka mun yi farin ciki sosai game da shi.
I'm trying to figure out what to say, how to put this.	Ina ƙoƙarin yin tunanin abin da zan faɗa, yadda za a saka wannan.
Maybe it is.	Wataƙila shi ne.
We decide to eat our food well.	Muna yanke shawarar cin abincin mu da kyau.
She covered him.	Ta rufe masa.
I paid a lot to let him go.	Na biya da yawa don ya bar shi.
Start with.	Fara da .
Here it is again.	Ga shi kuma ya sake faruwa.
She forgets things.	Ta kan manta abubuwa.
I have been going there for years.	Na yi shekaru ina zuwa can.
This is hard to write.	Wannan ya yi wuya a rubuta.
He did not know why he had done it to himself.	Bai san dalilin da ya sa ya yi wa kansa haka ba.
That's his job.	Aikin sa kenan.
He will still kill her.	Har yanzu zai kashe ta.
It took less than a week.	Hakan ya yi kasa da mako guda.
We have nothing to do with it.	Ba mu da wani abu da shi.
But it was the best thing she could do.	Amma shi ne mafi kyawun abin da za ta iya yi.
This toy is very fun.	Wannan abin wasa yana da daɗi sosai.
They will never do, but you never know.	Ba za su taba yi ba, amma ba ku sani ba.
So, don’t take it for granted.	Don haka, kar a ɗauka.
I'm not sure about that.	Ban tabbata akan hakan ba.
He sat and smoked.	Ya zauna yana shan taba.
I walk through my toilet.	Ina tafiya ta bayan gida na.
She spoke so loudly.	Ta fad'a sosai.
I know everything about my people.	Na san komai game da mutane na.
Slowly, it hasn’t done much yet.	A hankali, bai yi kadan ba tukuna.
She has no room for anyone.	Ba ta da dakin kowa.
It’s nice to be home, he tells us.	Yana da kyau zama gida, ya gaya mana.
There is no oil on it.	Babu mai a kansa.
I read that somewhere.	Na karanta cewa a wani wuri.
After us, many are coming.	Bayan mu, da yawa suna zuwa.
She got up and sat down.	Ta tashi zaune.
They won't talk about it.	Ba za su yi magana a kai ba.
She certainly did not know what to say to him.	Lallai ta rasa me zata ce masa.
Remember to turn off the driver.	Ka tuna don kashe mai tuƙi.
We said no, they left.	Muka ce a'a, suka tafi.
Travel to checkout.	Tafiya zuwa wurin biya.
He is injured, he needs help.	An ji masa rauni, yana buƙatar taimako.
For many things.	Na abubuwa da yawa.
They said no, they did not see.	Suka ce a'a, ba haka suka gani ba.
I don’t really know anything about it.	Ban san komai game da shi ba da gaske.
No time to finish.	Babu lokacin gama aikin.
He was wrong, not me.	Ya yi kuskure, ba ni ba.
It should just be played.	Ya kamata kawai a yi wasa.
The train station where the train station is.	Tashar jirgin kasa inda tashar jirgin kasa take.
Their flight was late.	Jirgin su ya makara ya tashi.
Look out.	Yi hankali.
I wondered if it would come out.	Na yi mamakin ko zai fito.
I don't feel mine.	Ba na jin nawa ne.
Let him walk.	Bari ya yi tafiya.
Even seemingly.	Ko da alama.
I know heaven and earth will not dwell yet.	Na san sama da kasa ba za su zauna ba tukuna.
They just have each other, whether they like it or not.	Suna da juna kawai, ko suna so ko ba sa so.
Everyone went, except me.	Kowa ya tafi, sai ni.
Police were called to the scene.	An kira ‘yan sanda zuwa wurin.
We got up on my way.	Muka tashi a hanya ta.
It passed very quickly.	Ya wuce da sauri da sauri.
Another train came from nowhere.	Wani jirgin kasa ya fito daga inda babu.
Please help us.	Da fatan za a taimake mu.
What kind of person is he?	Wane irin mutum ne.
You do not have to change anything.	Ba lallai ne ku canza komai ba.
Now, it seems to stop there.	Yanzu, da alama ya tsaya a can.
I did not know at the time.	Ban sani ba a lokacin.
Maybe two or three years.	Wataƙila shekaru biyu ko uku.
We hope you enjoy it !.	Muna fatan kun ji daɗi!.
This is a good job.	Wannan aiki ne mai kyau.
They look at what is above us.	Suna kallon abin da ke sama da mu.
But no.	Amma babu.
I will explain everything later.	Zan bayyana komai daga baya.
Everyone loves it.	Kowa ya so shi.

But this takes time.	Amma wannan yana ɗaukar lokaci.
That's what she does.	Abin da take yi kenan.
Then go outside.	Sai ka fita waje.
No one has ever tried it.	Babu wanda ya taɓa gwada shi.
They both stood open in the room.	Duka suka tsaya a bude a cikin dakin.
Just log in	Kawai shiga
Nothing is going right tonight.	Ba abin da ke tafiya daidai a daren yau.
I really like this game.	Ina matukar sha'awar wannan wasan.
And she sees.	Kuma tana gani.
That's what she did to him she thought of her.	Abin da ta yi masa kenan tana tunanin ta.
I called her at home.	Na kira ta a gida.
It will happen at some point.	Zai faru a wani lokaci.
He caught me.	Ya kama ni.
They just started going out.	Fita kawai suka fara.
Just a pleasure.	Kawai jin daɗi.
I don't have to call him now.	Bai kamata in kira shi yanzu ba.
Off you go now.	Kashe ka tafi yanzu.
It makes people happy who they are.	Yana sa mutane su ji daɗin ko wane ne su.
He knows something, but she is not sure.	Ya san wani abu, amma ita ba ta da tabbas.
Exactly exactly.	Daidai daidai.
Generally, but not always.	Kullum, amma ba koyaushe ba.
He could not really see anything.	Ya kasa ganin komai da gaske.
Think about it all.	Ka yi tunanin komai game da shi.
I want to tell you something.	Ina so in gaya muku wani abu.
It will be difficult.	Zai zama mai wahala.
Being great you can.	Da yake ku mai girma za ku iya.
It’s amazing to work with it.	Yana da ban mamaki don yin aiki tare da shi.
I was afraid of the place.	Ina tsoron wurin.
It's too early.	Yayi da wuri.
He told her.	Ya fad'a mata.
She is doing very well.	Tana yin kyau sosai.
I never wanted to see that.	Ban taba son ganin haka ba.
I know it is not.	Na san ba haka ba ne.
One by one.	Daya bayan daya.
But what he knows now is enough.	Amma abin da ya sani yanzu ya isa.
I never understood him.	Ban taba gane shi ba.
No one is there.	Babu wani a wurin.
I like this board.	Ina son wannan jirgin.
He agreed to talk to me.	Ya yarda ya yi magana da ni.
He can talk to you about everything you bring.	Yana iya magana da ku game da duk abin da kuka kawo.
No doubt they go to school.	Babu shakka suna tafiya makaranta.
I thought she would come back.	Na dauka zata dawo.
I want you to be happy and feel happy here.	Ina so ku yi farin ciki kuma kuna jin farin ciki a nan.
Which dog do you call?	Wane kare kuke kira?
It will do you good.	Zai yi muku kyau.
It’s scary and interesting overall.	Abin ban tsoro ne da ban sha'awa gaba ɗaya.
This has been tried before.	An gwada wannan a baya.
Tell me.	Ka ce min.
She told him she had something to tell him.	Ta ce masa tana da abin da za ta gaya masa.
Interesting, very interesting.	Ban sha'awa, mai ban sha'awa sosai.
I will give it to you after that.	Zan ba ku bayan wannan.
But you will not know.	Amma ba za ku sani ba.
How sick we do not know.	Yaya rashin lafiya ba mu sani ba.
Now, we talked a lot.	Yanzu, mun yi magana sosai.
They have to do it.	Dole ne su yi shi.
I suffered from apathy.	Na sha wahala daga rashin sha'awa.
Time of hardship, in fact.	Lokacin wahala, a gaskiya.
He said let you sit.	Ya ce barin ku zama.
It was full of money.	Ya cika da kudi.
That should be expected.	Ya kamata a yi tsammanin hakan.
They have one daughter.	Suna da 'ya daya.
They will always start thinking.	Kullum za su fara wani tunani.
Nothing but this.	Ba komai sai wannan.
There is no food except what you get.	Babu abinci sai abin da kuka samu.
No one came to see.	Babu wanda ya je ya gani.
There is so much to do.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a yi.
Forget everything.	Manta da komai.
They wanted to play.	Sun so su yi wasa.
Take her out.	Kai ta daga.
He is in you.	Yana cikin ku.
It was very scary.	Ya ba da tsoro sosai.
Maybe you did.	Wataƙila kun yi.
You can not help anyone.	Ba za ku iya taimakon kowa ba.
The driving route was used ahead of time.	An yi amfani da hanyar tuƙi kafin lokacin.
But we found each other.	Amma mun sami juna.
That is what she needs.	Abin da take bukata ke nan.
The car broke down on the way.	Motar ta yi rauni a hanya.
I could see he was scared.	Ina iya ganin shi yana jin tsoro.
Now he does not want to open it.	Yanzu bai so ya bude ba.
I want to find out what.	Ina so in gano menene.
It seems to have been fixed in place.	Da alama an gyara shi a wuri.
During this project.	A lokacin wannan aikin.
This is a wrong decision.	Wannan shawarar kuskure ne.
Today it looks like rain.	Yau ga shi kamar ruwan sama.
Appropriate work is like speaking right.	Aikin da ya dace yana kama da magana daidai.
She doesn't want to know now.	Ba ta son sani yanzu.
They seem to understand.	Da alama sun gane.
I do not mind.	Ban damu ba.
As before.	Kamar yadda yake a da.
The more knowledge, the more opportunities seem to appear.	Da ƙarin sani, da ƙarin damar da ake ganin suna bayyana.
Like fear.	Kamar tsoro.
I like a lot of things.	Ina son abubuwa da yawa.
You just need to look up.	Kuna buƙatar duba sama kawai.
Home is being prepared.	Ana kan shirya gida.
About the right to return home.	Game da daidai da koma gida.
She knows that.	Ta san haka.
She can't walk very well the second time.	Ba za ta iya tafiya sosai a karo na biyu ba.
We had a great time, and it was a great day.	Mun ji daɗi sosai, kuma rana ce mai kyau.
Here is another man.	Ga wani mutum.
He can only kill it now.	Kawai zai iya kashe shi yanzu.
He didn't look like he thought it was good.	Bai yi kama ba kamar yana tunanin yana da kyau.
I hope it works.	Ina fatan zai yi aiki.
But I'm just talking.	Amma ni kawai nake magana.
Like nothing will happen.	Kamar babu wani abu da zai faru.
I know you are sad about her.	Na san kuna bakin ciki da ita.
But if you are in doubt, just keep giving up somehow.	Amma idan kuna shakka kawai ku ci gaba da ba da wurin zama ta wata hanya.
But it was easy.	Amma ya kasance mai sauƙi.
But there is a problem.	Amma akwai matsala.
And after reading it twice.	Kuma bayan karanta shi sau biyu kenan.
There is no place like home.	Babu wuri kamar gida.
I can take it.	Zan iya ɗauka.
He does not need an answer.	Ba ya bukatar amsa.
Go upstairs.	Fita a sama.
He is still less than thirty years old.	Har yanzu bai cika shekara talatin ba.
I can walk	Zan iya tafiya
It should be a day of great rejoicing.	Ya kamata ya zama ranar farin ciki mai girma.
I know you are.	Na san kai ne.
What a joy it was.	Wani irin farin ciki ya yi.
I do not remember.	Ban tuna ba.
But it may not be for everyone.	Amma yana iya zama ba ga kowa ba.
You will probably be surprised at what you get.	Wataƙila za ku yi mamakin abin da kuka samu.
He was not present at the time.	A lokacin ba ya nan.
I was the last person they wanted around.	Ni ne mutum na ƙarshe da suke so a kusa.
You can join here.	Kuna iya shiga nan.
And he learned to do so as a child.	Kuma ya koyi yin haka tun yana yaro.
I think she stopped there.	Ina jin ta tsaya a can.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Ba ya son magana a kai.
And so it is.	Kuma haka abin yake.
I plan to return in a day.	Na shirya na koma cikin rana daya.
Now that is not good, is it? 	Yanzu hakan bai yi kyau ba ko?
But good things.	Amma abubuwa masu kyau.
He just wanted to make everyone stop fighting.	Ya so kawai ya sa kowa ya daina fada.
I'd like to see them outside.	Ina son ganin su a waje.
The work was done by hand.	An yi aikin da hannu da hannu.
It should not be so.	Ba haka ya kamata ta kasance ba.
Work is work, and money is money.	Aiki aiki ne, kuma kudi kudi ne.
I am not alone.	Ba ni kadai ba.
They did not buy the house.	Ba su sayi gidan ba.
It's not like you have to do it every day.	Ba kamar dole ne ku yi shi kowace rana ba.
She begins to cry.	Kuka ta fara yi.
It really isn’t a big deal.	A gaskiya ba wani babban abu ba ne.
Although they will.	Ko da yake za su yi.
You can see that this is also very sensible.	Kuna iya ganin cewa wannan ma yana da hankali sosai.
She doesn't want to think about the door.	Bata son tunanin kofar.
Of course I missed something.	Tabbas na rasa wani abu.
They know what they are and what they are about.	Sun san abin da suke da abin da suke game da.
Keep it simple, now.	Yi sauƙi, yanzu.
He was not there at the time.	Ba ya nan a lokacin.
I prepared correctly.	Na shirya daidai.
All work is done by hand.	Kowane aiki ana yin shi da hannu.
In because.	A cikin saboda.
The speaker is known here.	An san mai magana a nan.
Enjoy the whole day.	Ji daɗin ranar duka.
I don't have it.	Ba ni da shi.
He doesn't seem to care.	Da alama bai damu da hakan ba.
Let's make it happen.	Bari mu sa ya faru.
I should have been there.	Ya kamata in kasance a can.
He found himself doing more and more.	Ya samu kansa yana kara yi.
She said nothing.	Ta ce ba komai.
This person is in debt.	Wannan mutumin bashi ne.
These are given, not paid.	An ba da waɗannan, ba a biya su ba.
Maybe he was.	Wataƙila ya kasance.
Maybe he didn’t have time to travel.	Wataƙila bai sami lokacin tafiya ba.
Where to start.	Inda ya fara.
You just need to do it.	Kuna buƙatar yin shi kawai.
This leads us to the third and final answer.	Wannan ya kai mu ga amsa ta uku kuma ta ƙarshe.
We never did.	Ba mu taba yi ba.
I was wrong though.	Na yi kuskure ko da yake.
I am very excited about these things.	Ina jin daɗi sosai game da waɗannan abubuwan.
And you asked for that.	Kuma kun nemi wannan.
You hear a lot of talk.	Kuna jin magana mai yawa.
As usual.	Kamar yadda aka saba.
What time do you have?	Menene lokaci?
He has no one.	Ba shi da kowa.
It felt good, and it felt right.	Ya ji dadi, kuma ya ji daidai.
But don’t worry about doing too much.	Amma kar ka damu da yin yawa.
But it will.	Amma zai.
It works this way.	Yana aiki ta wannan hanya.
Do you want to sleep?	Kuna son barci.
An unprecedented celebration.	Bikin da ba a taba yi ba.
There are so many.	Akwai da yawa.
Maybe he sees more than anyone.	Wataƙila yana gani fiye da kowa.
I don't hope so.	Ba na fata ni ne.
I had a lot of fun with them.	Na yi farin ciki da yawa tare da su.
They made no noise, nor did they say a word.	Ba su yi wata ƙara ba, ba su kuma cewa ko ɗaya ba.
God sent the earth.	Allah ya aiki duniya.
To say no.	Don a ce ba haka ba.
The rain stopped.	Ruwan sama ya tsaya.
No, do not be afraid.	A'a, kar ka sake jin tsoro.
Everyone was very surprised.	Kowa ya yi mamaki sosai.
As you wish.	Kamar yadda kuke so.
And they are good at this project.	Kuma suna da kyau a wannan aikin.
They know it.	Sun san shi.
They are well known.	An san su gaba ɗaya.
I don't like that.	Ba na son hakan.
We did not hear the door open.	Ba mu ji an bude kofar ba.
Either way, maybe this is just my feeling.	Ko ta yaya, watakila wannan shine kawai ji na.
Even the nightgown didn’t matter.	Ko rigar dare bai damu ba.
Not me, everyone wanted me to be.	Ba ni ba, kowa ya so in zama.
'she passed.	' ta wuce.
She “went out to lunch” about that.	Ta "fita zuwa abincin rana" game da wannan.
She will not cry.	Ba za ta yi kuka ba.
Don't miss it.	Kada ku rasa shi.
Which in the past was not the best financial advice for me.	Wanda a baya ba shine mafi kyawun shawarar kuɗi a gare ni ba.
Not yet, it will be a week.	Ba tukuna, zai zama mako guda.
I have no interest in what happened.	Ba ni da sha'awar abin da ya faru.
It's morning.	Da safe kenan.
I have to go.	Dole na tafi.
He sat for a long time.	Ya dade a zaune.
Anything to win.	Duk wani abu don cin nasara.
Or think you do.	Ko tunanin kuna yi.
No problem, we were happy to do it.	Babu matsala, mun yi farin cikin yin hakan.
Here they take her.	Nan suka kai ta.
And it was almost not enough.	Kuma bai kusan isa ba.
Or on it.	Ko a kai.
Someone is coming.	Wani yana zuwa.
She told me the truth.	Ta yi min gaskiya.
We would say he really continues to feel.	Za mu ce da gaske ya ci gaba da ji.
And of course she did, when she met you.	Kuma tabbas ta yi, lokacin da ta hadu da ku.
He knows where they are weak.	Ya san inda suke da rauni.
It is useless to us.	Ba shi da amfani a gare mu.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
We don't want to, but we will.	Ba ma so, amma za mu yi.
To something.	Zuwa wani abu.
We hope it does not happen again.	Muna fatan hakan bai sake faruwa ba.
I can see myself wearing this on my wedding day.	Ina iya ganin kaina na sa wannan a ranar aure ta.
But tell him to do something else.	Amma ka gaya masa ya ƙara yin wani abu.
It was necessary to leave the station.	Ya zama dole a bar tashar.
They may love you.	Za su iya son ku.
O God, it is not me.	Ya Allah, ba ni bane.
She loves it very much.	Tana son shi sosai.
Some have already got it.	Wasu sun riga sun samu.
That is why we are moving forward.	Wannan shi ne ya sa mu ci gaba.
Can you give me a hand with this?	Za a iya ba ni hannu da wannan?
Maybe this will be my favorite movie of all time.	Wataƙila wannan zai zama fim ɗin da na fi so a kowane lokaci.
It is completely absent.	Ba shi da gaba daya.
Was it funny?	Ya kasance abin ban dariya ne?
They did not give him money.	Ba su ba shi kuɗi ba.
It was week to week.	Ya kasance mako zuwa mako.
He does not need to.	Ba ya bukata.
We can also check it out now.	Za mu iya kuma duba shi a yanzu.
I want to do mine.	Ina so in yi nawa.
I like that.	Na so haka.
Get your money's worth.	Sami kuɗin ku.
I'm not laughing.	Ba dariya nake ba.
He quickly left.	Da sauri ya tafi.
I think I still got a job there.	Ina tsammanin har yanzu na sami aiki a wurin.
They are more active.	Sun fi aiki.
He did not want one or the other.	Bai so daya ko daya ba.
He was alone.	Ya kasance shi kaɗai.
It's better.	Ya fi kyau.
You didn't seem to mind.	Ba ka yi kamar ba haka ba ne.
I feel good.	Na ji dadi.
There is so much to see.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a gani.
This is a great thing.	Wannan abu ne mai girma gaske.
Su kenan.	Su kenan.
This is the way to the beach.	Wannan ita ce hanyar zuwa bakin ruwa.
I have been waiting for him to come.	Na dade ina jira ya zo.
They were not happy and excited.	Ba su kasance masu farin ciki da farin ciki ba.
Do you think we need to go there?	Kuna ganin muna bukatar mu je can?
They have such a great sense of humor.	Suna da irin wannan babban abin ban dariya.
The night is cold.	Dare yayi sanyi.
I don't care.	Ban damu da shi ba.
I will let them in.	Zan bar su su shiga.
And write a lot of things.	Kuma rubuta abubuwa da yawa.
Try walking slowly.	Gwada tafiya a hankali.
Everything looked more than real.	Komai ya duba fiye da na gaske.
She also wanted to go out.	Ita ma ta so fita.
This, over time, has come to the fore.	Wannan, a kan lokaci, ya kai ga sunan.
What they do.	Abin da suke yi.
It's really kind of funny.	Yana da ainihin irin ban dariya.
Travel may be required.	Ana iya buƙatar tafiya.
I hope someone can help me continue here.	Ina fata wani zai iya taimaka mini in ci gaba a nan.
He would never like me or her.	Ba zai taba so ni ko ita ba.
The house is very big.	Gidan yayi girma sosai.
I said release me.	Na ce ka sake ni.
This is the first.	Wannan shi ne na farko.
This trip will be the last one together.	Wannan tafiya za ta zama ta ƙarshe tare.
I could not find a way to work with it.	Ba zan iya samun hanyar yin aiki da shi ba.
So she did not.	Don haka ba ta yi ba.
He sat in it.	Ya zauna a ciki.
She put on another.	Ta saka wani.
Finally, there it is.	A ƙarshe, akwai shi.
You do not get it.	Ba ka samun shi.
Ask for experiences.	Tambayi abubuwan da suka faru.
One, two, three.	Daya, biyu, uku.
He will worry about the rest later.	Zai damu da sauran daga baya.
I need to find out why they happen.	Ina bukata in gano dalilin da yasa suke faruwa.
Can anyone please explain?	Shin wani zai iya bayyana mani don Allah.
I want that for you.	Ina son hakan a gare ku.
What are you doing tonight?	Me kuke yi a daren nan?
You are so beautiful.	Kun yi kyau sosai.
That could not be real.	Wannan ba zai iya zama na gaske ba.
You can come now, if you want.	Kuna iya zuwa yanzu, idan kuna so.
Where to go no thoughts.	Inda za mu je ba ko tunani.
As it was at every moment of the game.	Kamar yadda yake a kowane lokaci na wasan.
It's nothing.	Ba wani abu bane.
I know what this looks like, but.	Na san yadda wannan yake kama, amma.
I didn’t go out to eat, drink, or anything.	Ban fita don ci, sha, ko wani abu ba.
We work very fast.	Muna aiki da sauri sosai.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Babu wani abu a kai da ke game da su.
Seats around girls.	Abubuwan zama a kusa da 'yan mata.
He is not there now.	Ba yanzu yana can ba.
I can't even try it.	Ba zan iya ko gwada shi ba.
Such things will happen to him more than once.	Irin wannan abubuwa za su faru da shi fiye da sau ɗaya.
Not like that.	Ba irin wannan ba.
And everyone knows that.	Kuma kowa ya san wannan.
It is not very big.	Ba shi da girma sosai.
Everything was checked.	An duba komai.
I know nothing.	Ban san komai ba.
It's really cold.	Yayi sanyi da gaske.
There is only one problem, I have not read any of them.	Matsala daya ce kawai, ban karanta komai a cikin su ba.
It's amazing.	Abin ban mamaki ne.
They do more.	Suna kara yi.
We don’t know what it takes to get the job done.	Ba mu san abin da ake bukata don yin aikin ba.
I want to know how you feel about me.	Ina so in san yadda kuke ji game da ni.
It is the only ship that can afford it.	Shi ne kawai jirgin da zai iya biya.
He came after.	Ya zo bayan.
Be positive whether you are ahead.	Ka kasance mai kyau ko kana gaba.
I know this and I am not very comfortable.	Na san wannan kuma ba ni da dadi sosai.
They did not expect to cry.	Ba su yi tsammanin yin kuka haka ba.
So this is what you ate for dinner.	Don haka abin da kuka ci abincin dare ke nan.
I tell you, it is a thing.	Na gaya muku, abu ne.
This drink is delicious.	Wannan abin sha yana da dadi.
I feel like a child	Ina jin kamar yaro
I know how to do it.	Na san yadda zan yi.
They are safe.	Suna lafiya.
And look there.	Kuma duba can.
The reason she didn’t die was the dog.	Dalilin da ya sa ba ta mutu ba shine kare.
It couldn’t be easier !.	Ba zai iya zama da sauƙi ba!.
Do one thing at a time.	Yi abu ɗaya a lokaci guda.
He has nothing to lose.	Ba shi da abin da zai rasa.
I looked at it.	Na duba shi.
You have not forgotten these things.	Ba ku manta da waɗannan abubuwa ba.
Fear gripped her.	Tsoro ya kama ta.
He feared the players would kill him.	Ya ji tsoron 'yan wasan za su kashe shi.
See you tomorrow too.	Kai gobe ma.
The man named the first three.	Mutumin mai suna uku na farko.
It's a big deal.	Babban abu ne.
At first she felt the need.	Da farko ta ji bukatar.
I'm sure you'll do well !.	Na tabbata za ku yi kyau!.
She doesn't need my help.	Ba ta bukatar taimako na.
It should increase the running time.	Kamata yayi ya kara bata lokacin gudu.
The house is nice.	Gidan yayi kyau.
That no doubt but also.	Cewa babu shakka amma kuma.
, can be found below right.	, za a iya samu a kasa dama.
Remember, please.	Ka tuna, don Allah.
He has to hurry.	Dole ne ya yi sauri.
It was a great success.	Ya kasance babban nasara.
Everything fits together.	Komai ya dace tare.
I feel like she is gone.	Ina jin ta tafi.
Things are starting to get really clear.	Abubuwa sun fara bayyana sosai.
Or the plane.	Ko jirgin.
We will wait until they fall asleep.	Za mu jira sai sun yi barci.
I'm sure it will be in a day or two.	Na tabbata zai kasance cikin kwana ɗaya ko biyu.
They only did that at night.	Sun yi haka ne kawai da dare.
It can't be done.	Ba za a iya yi ba.
His head was badly injured.	Kan ya samu mummunan rauni.
We need to speak in person only.	Muna bukatar mu yi magana a cikin mutum kawai.
He didn't laugh very much.	Bai yi dariya sosai ba.
It's just enough.	Ya isa kawai.
This is definitely not true.	Wannan ko shakka babu gaskiya ne.
I will help you.	Zan taimake ku.
Time will tell.	Lokaci zai nuna.
I could have been there for years.	Zan iya zama a can tsawon shekaru.
I don't know where to start.	Ban san ta inda zan fara ba.
People are walking.	Mutane suna tafiya.
I will never leave my children.	Ba zan taba barin yara na ba.
The name of the day, you know.	Sunan ranar, ka sani.
We passed him and sat down.	Muka wuce shi muka zauna.
I don’t think you will, though.	Ba na jin za ku yi, ko da yake.
He is more than alive.	Ya fi mai rai.
It is a useful thing to have.	Abu ne mai amfani a samu.
Turn it on.	Kunna shi.
It goes well.	Yana tafiya da kyau.
They are not alone.	Ba su kawai ba.
You are not very fast.	Ba ku da sauri sosai.
We arrived at the end.	Mun isa na karshen.
But not in mine.	Amma ba a cikin nawa ba.
They will no longer know how they will feel.	Ba za su ƙara sanin yadda za su ji ba.
They do not know who is reading it.	Ba su san wanda ke karanta shi ba.
He still has things to do.	Har yanzu yana da abubuwan da zai yi.
I don’t need to talk much.	Ba na bukatar in yi magana da yawa.
I have my own way.	Ina da nawa hanya.
He had seen this look before.	Ya taba ganin wannan kallon a baya.
But now she too is beginning to forget us.	Amma yanzu ita ma ta fara manta da mu.
But I don’t know how to get it to work.	Amma ban san yadda zan samu shi aiki ba.
None of this error.	Babu wani daga cikin wannan kuskure.
They should not eat too much or too much at the same time.	Kada su ci abinci da sauri ko da yawa a lokaci guda.
This is something that has been in the works for a while.	Wannan wani abu ne da ke cikin aikin na ɗan lokaci.
You have to look at them.	Dole ne ku kalli su.
Honestly I could not understand what had happened.	Gaskiya na kasa gane abin da ya faru.
The sky is the only place.	Sama wuri ne kaɗai.
Sometimes it’s more about just doing it during the day.	Wani lokaci ya fi game da kawai yin shi cikin rana.
I will work on that.	Zan yi aiki a kan hakan.
She was not happy to have us there.	Ba ta jin daɗin samun mu a wurin.
We are close now.	Muna kusa yanzu.
The kind of person he is.	Irin mutumin da yake.
I do not know how to do it.	Ban san yadda zan yi ba.
Whatever you have, you have.	Duk abin da kuke da shi, kuna da.
Actually, it is not.	A gaskiya, ba haka ba.
Be careful not to miss anything.	Yi hankali kada ku rasa komai.
Is it really just what you would say?	Shin da gaske ne kawai abin da za ku ce?
It did not kill you.	Ba kashe ku ba.
I don't like this.	Ba na son wannan.
Not a big deal, though.	Ba babban abu ba, ko da yake.
All at the same time.	Duk a lokaci guda.
I know you are.	Na san kai ke nan.
There must be something they can’t take.	Dole ne akwai abin da ba za su iya ɗauka ba.
She wanted to know him.	Ta so ta san shi.
This makes them very happy.	Hakan ya sa su farin ciki sosai.
Many are already dead.	Da yawa sun riga sun mutu.
That bothered us.	Cewa ya yi mana wahala .
The stomach hurts.	Ciki yayi zafi.
I published it last night.	Na buga shi a daren jiya.
It should be the same.	Haka ya kamata ta kasance.
She's definitely not reading this.	Ta tabbata ba ta karanta wannan ba.
Knowing, in the end, is nothing for you.	Sanin, a ƙarshe, babu abin da ta kasance a gare ku.
Now the third.	Yanzu na uku.
You can find everything there.	Kuna iya samun komai a wurin.
The metal must see the same thing.	Karfe dole ya ga abu daya.
Don't let it touch you.	Kar ka bari ya taba.
And so it was.	Kuma haka ya kasance.
There are so many things going on that way.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ke faruwa haka.
But that still leaves us with a problem.	Amma wannan har yanzu yana barin mu da matsala.
He never did anything great.	Bai taba yin wani babban abu ba.
It was a great way to think.	Ya kasance hanya mai kyau don tunani.
She is no more useful to me than you are.	Ba ta da sauran amfani gare ni fiye da yadda kuke yi.
The boat travels several times a day.	Jirgin ruwan yana tafiya sau da yawa a rana.
I did not wait for them.	Ban jira su ba.
She didn't think, she just did.	Bata yi tunani ba, kawai ta yi.
So, find something to eat and drink.	Don haka, sami abin da za ku ci ku sha.
It's more like.	Ya fi kama.
She will tell me and she is always right.	Za ta gaya mani kuma koyaushe tana daidai.
He saved the oil, finished but did not show.	Ya ajiye mai, ya gama amma bai nuna ba.
You need to find it.	Kuna buƙatar gano shi.
I just want attention.	Ina son hankali ne kawai.
One respondent may not like them all.	Mai amsa guda ɗaya ba zai iya son su duka ba.
You passed it.	Ka wuce shi.
She used to write down what happened.	Ta kasance tana rubuta abin da ya faru.
This is not the time to grow in success.	Wannan ba lokacin girma ba ne a cikin nasara.
Call it on.	Kira shi a kan shi.
But the future remains.	Amma gaba ya kasance.
You can give it easy.	Kuna iya ba shi sauƙi.
You think you know what you want.	Kuna tsammanin kun san abin da kuke so.
Only use people.	Yi amfani da mutane kawai.
However, one must try.	Duk da haka, dole ne mutum ya gwada.
What else could you like ?.	Me kuma za ku iya so?.
They are happy.	Suna farin ciki.
It's good too.	Yana da kyau kuma.
The method is not common.	Hanyar ba kowa.
She was very intelligent.	Ta kasance mai hankali.
They make you laugh, and they change the way you look at the world.	Suna ba ku dariya, kuma suna canza yadda kuke kallon duniya.
Now the situation is dire.	Yanzu abin ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
I lied to him.	Na yi masa karya.
He did not want to go.	Bai so ya tafi ba.
Would you like to help with dinner?	Kuna so ku taimaka da abincin dare?
I know what's going on.	Na san abin da ke faruwa.
This is a surprise.	Wannan abin mamaki ne.
Let's do it.	Mu yi yi.
That surprised me.	Abin ya bani mamaki.
But it has another advantage.	Amma yana da wani amfani kuma.
The game itself is good.	Wasan da kansa yayi kyau.
She pointed at me.	Ta nuna ni.
He is drinking coffee slowly.	Yana shan kofi a hankali.
It makes the game out of you.	Ya sa wasan ya fita daga kai.
But it would be better for me to go.	Amma zai yi kyau in tafi.
I do not know anything.	Ban san komai ba.
They all raised their heads.	Duk suka daga kai.
It seems to work for us.	Da alama yana yi mana aiki.
Otherwise you will do this all night.	In ba haka ba za ku yi wannan duk dare.
And, she won't find anyone tonight.	Kuma, ba za ta sami kowa a daren yau ba.
She will only speak once.	Zata yi magana sau ɗaya kawai.
I think it's fake.	Ina tsammanin karya ne.
Now let's get involved.	Yanzu bari mu shiga.
Nice exit.	Kyakkyawan fita.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a san abin da ya faru da sauran yanke ba.
Nothing.	Abu babu.
She didn't get it.	Ba ta samu ba.
In the house.	A cikin gidan.
It is time to stop.	Lokaci ya yi da za a daina.
Suppose that happened.	A ce hakan ya faru.
It is done as follows.	Ana yin haka kamar haka.
Your name before mine.	Sunan ku kafin nawa.
I will not see it grow.	Ba zan ga yana kara girma ba.
That would not be right.	Hakan ba zai yi daidai ba.
Nothing to say.	Babu abin da za a ce.
I said that.	Na ce haka.
I love him.	Ina son shi.
She will not leave me.	Ba za ta bar ni ba.
Sleep here for as long as you want.	Yi barci a nan har tsawon lokacin da kuke so.
People assume you want it.	Mutane sun ɗauka kana so.
I think it's good that they showed up.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau cewa sun nuna.
He is unknown.	Shi ne wanda ba a sani ba.
Eventually, he quit smoking.	A ƙarshe, ya daina shan taba.
Just yesterday.	Kamar jiya.
And it can happen now.	Kuma yana iya faruwa a yanzu.
Amazing if you will.	Abin ban mamaki idan kuna so.
We are tired of only two.	Mun gaji da biyu kawai.
He can run.	Zai iya gudu.
But then he remembered that was not true.	Amma sai ya tuna cewa ba gaskiya ba ne.
I didn’t really care for him at first.	Ban kula shi sosai ba da farko.
But this is nothing new to them.	Amma wannan ba sabon abu ba ne a gare su.
Think if you will.	Ka yi tunanin idan za ka so.
First back.	Na farko baya.
I started crying.	Na fara kuka.
An interesting home from home.	Gida mai ban sha'awa daga gida.
Now this will not hurt a bit.	Yanzu wannan ba zai ɗan yi zafi ba.
I get some sleep night or day.	Ina samun ɗan barci dare ko rana.
Of course he can.	Tabbas zai iya.
I want both of you to talk.	Ina son ku biyu ku yi magana.
I have some money of my own.	Ina da wasu kuɗi na kaina.
He didn't think he would.	Bai yi tunanin zai yi ba.
Here we stop.	A nan za mu tsaya.
But that doesn't work.	Amma hakan baya aiki.
I know that tomorrow will continue.	Na san cewa gobe za a ci gaba.
There he stayed.	Nan ya zauna.
You have to see what you can get there.	Dole ne ku ga abin da za ku iya samu a can.
It doesn't feel right.	Da alama baya jin dadi.
We see that.	Mun ga haka.
Or call me.	Ko kuma a kira ni.
That changes everything, if you can get a job.	Wannan yana canza komai, idan kuna iya samun aiki.
She has beautiful skin.	Ta na da kyau fata.
It's amazing to see.	Yana da ban mamaki gani.
You will do what you say.	Za ku yi abin da kuka ce.
I know this is a bad job yet.	Na san cewa wannan mummunan aiki ne amma duk da haka.
If you want to spend time alone, go outside.	Idan kana son kashe lokaci kai kaɗai, fita waje.
I wonder what these people are thinking.	Ina mamakin abin da waɗannan mutane suke tunani.
There is no way this will work.	Babu yadda wannan zai yi.
So he saved some.	Don haka ya ajiye wasu.
He saw things.	Ya ga abubuwa.
Keep up the good work, man.	Ka ci gaba da aikin, mutum.
Which in fact they are.	Wanda a gaskiya sun zama.
We will take it one by one.	Za mu dauka daya bayan daya.
There is not much to say.	Babu da yawa da za a ce.
We have dinner.	Muna da abincin dare.
We have to go.	Dole ne mu tafi.
They are so beautiful and they are so beautiful.	Suna da kyau sosai kuma suna da kyau sosai.
These drinks are bad.	Waɗannan abubuwan sha ba su da kyau.
Eventually, someone will come to her.	A ƙarshe, wani zai zo mata.
The rain stopped last night.	Ruwan sama ya tsaya a daren jiya.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
Let's go.	Mu tafi.
Maybe that's not true, she realized, as she said.	Wataƙila hakan ba gaskiya ba ne, ta gane, kamar yadda ta faɗa.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Amma da alama hakan bai taimaka ba.
I have not told anyone about this.	Ban gaya wa kowa game da wannan ba.
I remember I was scared, yet I was happy.	Na tuna ina jin tsoro, duk da haka ina farin ciki.
It is time to do something new.	Lokaci yayi da za a yi sabon abu gaba ɗaya.
Time seems to stop.	Lokaci yayi kamar ya tsaya.
Your game is good.	Wasan ku yana da kyau.
She moved to another school.	Ta koma wata makaranta.
So, you know, there is this.	Don haka, ka sani, akwai wannan.
It grows every week.	Yana girma kowane mako.
First.	Na farko.
I couldn’t even bring myself to leave the room in the afternoon.	Ban ma iya kawo kaina na bar dakin da rana ba.
He could never tell her that.	Bai taba iya gaya mata haka ba.
And you are.	Kuma kai ne.
It's simple and such a beautiful song.	Yana da sauƙi kuma irin wannan kyakkyawan waƙa.
I knew they didn't cover me.	Na san ba su rufe ni ba.
She told them to go play.	Ta ce su tafi wasa.
They won't let you get caught.	Ba za su bari ka kama ba.
I would have given you one.	Da zan baka daya.
Just keep going until it works.	Kawai ku ci gaba har sai ya yi aiki.
That made it even harder.	Hakan ya kara wahala.
For the article, go here.	Don labarin, je nan.
Fish live in water.	Kifi suna rayuwa a cikin ruwa.
Now is not the time to start enjoying yourself.	Yanzu ba lokaci ba ne don fara jin daɗi.
I don't think so.	Ba na tunanin haka.
I began to speak to myself like her.	Na fara yi wa kaina magana kamar ita.
It seems to help.	Da alama ya taimaka.
I am familiar with everyone.	Na saba da kowa.
There is no more time to think now.	Babu sauran lokacin tunani yanzu.
As it turns out, we didn’t read much.	Kamar yadda ya faru, ba mu yi karatu da yawa ba.
He wanted to be very clear.	Ya so ya bayyana sosai.
At one point, everyone was in pain.	A wani lokaci, kowa ya ji zafi.
Then everyone left.	Sai kowa ya tafi.
I will not run away.	Ba zan gudu ba.
No one knows what can happen.	Babu sanin abin da ka iya faruwa.
but really, it was a good day.	amma da gaske, rana ce mai kyau.
Man and dog.	Mutum da kare.
But this is not it.	Amma wannan ba shi ba ne.
Go and see for yourself.	Ku je ku gani da kanku.
It's like you don't want to be recognized.	Kamar ba ka son a gane ka.
But the story is not true.	Amma labarin ba gaskiya bane.
It would be good for everyone but me.	Zai yi kyau ga kowa sai ni.
Please people can be left alone.	Don Allah za a iya barin mutane su kaɗai.
But he came.	Amma ya zo.
The room is very large.	Dakin yana da girma sosai.
I do not know what to think.	Ban san abin da zan yi tunani ba.
We need you.	Muna bukatar ku.
He did not want to go.	Bai so ya tafi.
When in doubt, work from the outside to the inside.	Lokacin da ake shakka, yi aiki daga waje a ciki.
The whole weekend was like that.	Duk karshen mako ya kasance haka.
He wants to die.	Yana son ya mutu.
No one knows.	Babu wanda ya sani.
But that will never happen.	Amma hakan ba zai taba faruwa ba.
I'm printing it.	Ina buga shi.
God, loves her very much.	Allah, ya so ta sosai.
I'm there	ina can
Of course, he did not know me.	Tabbas, bai san ni ba.
Pretty good skin there.	Kyakkyawan kyakkyawan fata a wurin.
I have been thinking about this for a long time.	Na dade ina tunanin hakan.
This is a new feeling for me.	Wannan sabon ji ne a gare ni.
Hope you can't tell.	Da fatan ba za ku iya fada ba.
Until they stop.	Har sai da suka daina.
So far, so good.	Ya zuwa yanzu, yana da kyau.
He will not get it.	Ba zai samu ba.
But it led to this mistake.	Amma ya kai ga wannan kuskure.
I think they will see it good.	Ina tsammanin za su ga ya yi kyau.
If not for me.	Idan ba don ni ba.
We do not know when this was done.	Ba mu san lokacin da aka yi haka ba.
We had to take her to the back of the car.	Sai mun kai ta bayan mota.
You help a lot of kids out there.	Kuna taimaka wa yara da yawa a can.
There’s something about it, something.	Akwai wani abu game da shi, wani abu.
No, that's it.	A'a, shi ke nan.
They were to take all but nothing.	Sun kasance don ɗaukar duka ba su sami komai ba.
I wrote back.	Na rubuta baya.
And who knows, maybe it is.	Kuma wa ya sani, watakila shi ne.
She doesn't like that.	Ba ta son hakan.
He wanted to stop.	Ya so ya tsaya.
She will find out.	Zata gano.
This is you.	Wannan shine ku.
He can make a lot more money than I do.	Zai iya samun kuɗi da yawa fiye da ni.
Even at your favorite restaurant.	Ko a gidan abincin da ya fi so.
And do not know.	Kuma kada ku sani.
It is two o'clock in the morning.	Karfe biyu na safe.
And you will change.	Kuma za ku canza.
I think she was right.	Ina ganin ta yi gaskiya.
But we are sure we did very well.	Amma mun tabbata mun yi kyau sosai.
Now she wonders why.	Yanzu tana mamakin dalilin.
Don't feel anything.	Kada ku ji komai.
In fact, many do.	A gaskiya ma, mutane da yawa suna yi.
Some are larger.	Wasu sun fi girma.
There is another.	Akwai kuma wani.
He looked a little.	Ya duba kadan.
But there are better things to do.	Amma akwai abubuwa mafi kyau da za a yi.
Stop here.	Tsaya a nan.
You will never touch exactly what you want.	Ba za ku taɓa taɓa ainihin abin da kuke so ba.
No one was told.	Ba wanda aka gaya wa.
You will die here.	Za ku mutu a nan.
The game failed.	Wasan ya yi rashin nasara.
He did a good job and got up very fast.	Ya yi kyakkyawan aiki kuma ya tashi da sauri da sauri.
It is done.	Ana yi.
I didn't think it was you.	Ban yi tsammanin kai ne ba.
We killed them a lot.	Mun kashe su da yawa.
But tomorrow we will bring you back.	Amma gobe za mu dawo da ku.
No thoughts have come to him yet.	Har yanzu babu wani tunani da ya zo masa.
It cannot be after that.	Ba za a iya zama bayan wannan ba.
Just play with you.	Kawai wasa da ku.
Money is required.	Ana buƙatar kuɗi.
I plan to start your project now.	Na shirya fara aikin ku a yanzu.
Do not be afraid to make mistakes.	Kada ku ji tsoron yin kuskure.
However now this does not work.	Duk da haka a yanzu wannan baya aiki.
Traveling at night?	Tafiya da dare?
A child can recognize it.	Yaro zai iya gane shi.
Please do not worry.	Don Allah kar a damu.
Just read it.	Kawai karanta shi.
No one is saying that.	Babu wanda ke cewa haka.
Without it, you have nothing.	Ba tare da shi, ba ku da komai.
And it is.	Kuma shi ne.
I can't write this book right now.	Ba zan iya rubuta wannan littafin ba a yanzu.
I hear you now.	Ina jin ku yanzu.
He said nothing about the victim.	Bai ce komai ba game da wanda aka kashe.
I think I will be paid well.	Ina tsammanin za a biya ni da kyau.
They know the name.	Sun san suna.
We are going this way.	Muna tafiya ta wannan hanya.
He failed completely.	Ya kasa gaba daya.
And we are not alone.	Kuma ba mu kadai ba.
They will not close.	Ba za su rufe ba.
It tastes so good.	Yayi dadi sosai.
They did, but slowly.	Sun yi, amma a hankali.
Homemade food is prepared.	An shirya abinci na gida.
We always went out.	Muka fita kullum.
A new movie.	Wani sabon fim.
Now it's a little cold.	Yanzu ya dan yi sanyi.
It will not be an easy task.	Ba zai zama aiki mai sauƙi ba.
Do not forget that you love it.	Kada ka manta cewa kana son shi.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
I can't reach him.	Ba zan iya isa gare shi ba.
Sorry to put you in that.	Yi hakuri da sanya ku cikin hakan.
It is very cold.	An yi sanyi sosai.
After that, he lost interest in school.	Bayan haka, ya daina sha'awar makaranta.
It doesn't seem fair to upset her.	Da alama bai dace ya bata mata rai ba.
I will not call.	Ba zan kira ba.
Unable to accept.	An kasa yarda da shi.
It uses water.	Tana amfani da ruwa.
Here is what we sent.	Ga abin da muka aika.
And this is something that cannot be.	Kuma wannan abu ne da ba zai iya zama ba.
Someone may want to live that way.	Wani yana iya son rayuwa haka.
We have to take the road.	Dole ne mu dauki hanya.
We are with you in this work.	Muna tare da ku a wannan aikin.
Now and then.	Yanzu da kuma.
She did it.	Ta yi shi.
Maybe she was there too.	Wataƙila ita ma tana can.
I hope we will be able to use it.	Ina fatan za mu sami damar yin amfani da shi.
So it was enough.	Don haka ya isa.
There is someone very early.	Akwai wani da wuri sosai.
Then mine.	Sai nawa.
Although, this did not happen.	Ko da yake, wannan bai faru ba.
I know this is amazing.	Na san wannan abin ban mamaki ne.
Do well in school today.	Yi kyau a makaranta a yau.
She could not do anything.	Ta kasa yin komai.
She didn't spend much time talking to me.	Bata bata lokaci mai yawa tana min magana ba.
We wasted no time.	Ba mu bata lokaci ba.
Nothing to worry about.	Babu abin da za ku damu.
But he will not remember many of the events.	Amma ba zai tuna da yawa abubuwan da suka faru ba.
I help you, help me.	Na taimake ku, ku taimake ni.
I just heard it.	Na ji shi kawai.
Maybe that's not enough.	Wataƙila hakan bai isa ba.
They keep me together.	Suna ajiye ni tare.
Everything feels right in my world.	Komai ya ji daidai a duniya ta.
Then they went to another house and slept.	Daga nan suka wuce wani gida suka yi barci.
No, you hit.	A'a, kun buga.
Well done as you watch tonight.	Da kyau kamar yadda kuke kallon daren yau.
He said that again.	Ya sake cewa.
He will be caught sighted.	Za a kama shi da gani.
First, you need two	Na farko, kuna buƙatar biyu
He took me home.	Ya tafi da ni gida.
He raised his hand in triumph.	Ya daga hannu cikin nasara.
This is good.	Wannan yana da kyau.
He did not remember who sent it.	Bai tuna wanda ya aika ba.
The sun is hot.	Rana ta yi zafi.
We must give him time.	Dole ne mu ba shi lokaci.
Identify the problem, and fix it.	Gano matsalar, kuma gyara ta.
I never liked her.	Ban taba son ta ba.
Why me? 	Me yasa ni?
he thought.	yayi tunani.
We do not know when.	Ba mu san yaushe ba.
Two simple things are enough.	Abubuwa biyu masu sauƙi sun isa.
I wondered if it was why she didn't care.	Na yi tunanin ko shi ya sa ba ta damu ba.
I am leaving.	Zan tafi.
It proved successful.	Ya tabbatar da nasara.
I am looking for three.	Ina neman guda uku.
It will not do well.	Ba zai yi kyau ba.
God has magnified.	Allah ya kara girma.
She made sure no one saw her crying.	Ta tabbatar babu wanda ya ga tana kuka.
I'll play anyway and that's it.	Zan yi wasa ta wata hanya kuma shi ke nan.
He stopped doing it.	Ya daina yi.
Don't play again.	Kar a sake yin wasa.
Increase heat.	Ƙara zafi.
He just went.	Kawai ya tafi.
Nothing, and no.	Babu komai, kuma ba.
But think about it.	Amma ka yi tunani a kan hakan.
I will not drink too much.	Ba zan sha da yawa ba.
You do not know how to care for anyone.	Ba ku san yadda za ku damu da kowa ba.
Not common.	Ba na kowa ba.
And like sometimes, we do, sometimes we don't.	Kuma kamar wani lokacin, muna yin haka, wani lokacin ba ma yin haka.
She tried it and tried it.	Ta gwada ta gwada kuma ta gwada.
It has to be.	Dole ya zama.
Right missed very much.	Dama da aka rasa sosai.
Is it tasty!	Yana da dadi!
They want to return to something they once knew.	Suna so su koma wani abu da suka taɓa sani.
I have never seen them so close.	Ban taba ganin su kusa ba.
But he seems to like it.	Amma da alama yana son hakan.
And she doesn't care.	Kuma bata damu ba.
He would never say such a thing.	Ba zai taba cewa irin wannan abu ba.
Don't worry about me.	Kar ka damu ni.
I do not know why this is happening.	Ban san dalilin da yasa hakan ke faruwa ba.
In fact, the one you came from.	A gaskiya, wanda kuka fito.
Do not tell anyone.	Kar a gaya wa kowa.
And it works really well.	Kuma yana aiki sosai.
They do not know what the world is like.	Ba su san yadda duniya take ba.
In the third we stop.	A na uku mu tsaya.
There is nothing there.	Babu komai a wurin.
I hope to see you again.	Ina fatan sake ganin ku.
You want me to stay.	Kuna so in zauna.
It took two.	Ya dauki biyu.
This will be my last hot spot.	Wannan zai zama wurin zafi na na ƙarshe.
I just wouldn’t do it.	Ba zan yi kawai ba.
But you know how people are.	Amma ka san yadda mutane suke.
And they did.	Kuma sun yi haka.
And she knew it.	Kuma ta san shi.
But she knows him well.	Amma ta san shi sosai.
I hate you altogether.	Na ƙi ku gaba ɗaya.
Anyway let's go.	Duk da haka sai mu tafi.
But he wanted to.	Amma ya so.
They are finished with you.	Sun gama da ku.
And still not.	Kuma har yanzu ba.
We just got it.	Mun samu kawai.
New place every day.	Sabon wuri kowace rana.
You will probably become the person you want to know.	Da alama za ku zama mutumin da za ku sani.
He read a funny read.	Yayi karatu mai ban dariya.
It all came together.	Gaba d'aya ya had'u.
That she asked me for money.	Cewa ta tambaye ni kudi.
Please stop smoking.	Da fatan za a daina shan taba.
He got so good that nothing big happened without him.	Ya samu kyau sosai wanda babu wani babban abu da ya faru in ba shi ba.
We talk a lot.	Muna fada sosai.
I have never enjoyed swimming since I was a child.	Ban ji daɗin yin iyo tun ina yaro ba.
But he will publish this.	Amma zai buga wannan.
I can't let it go.	Ba zan iya barin shi ya tafi ba.
We were back there.	Mun kasance a can baya.
Hope to keep coming back.	Da fatan za a ci gaba da zuwa.
I do not do such things.	Ba na yin irin waɗannan abubuwa.
He did an amazing job.	Ya yi aiki mai ban mamaki.
I understand that you are working.	Na fahimci cewa kuna aiki.
They will not buy.	Ba za su saya ba.
What he was doing felt like.	Abin da yake yi ya ji kamar.
They have never been this way.	Ba su taba zama haka ba.
They just need to run.	Suna bukatar kawai su gudu.
I heard more then.	Na ji ƙarin a lokacin.
But let's get out of here.	Amma mu fara fita daga nan.
This is a short period of time.	Wannan shi ne ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
And now is the time.	Kuma ya zo yanzu lokacin da ya dace.
But it just isn't true.	Amma kawai ba gaskiya ba ne.
The train stopped.	Jirgin ya tsaya.
He would not want it anyway.	Ba zai so ta wata hanya ba.
That would make me fail.	Hakan zai sa ni kasa.
Only two thirds.	Biyu ne kawai cikin uku.
They go out with people.	Suna fita da mutane.
That's what we do.	Haka muke yi.
But that’s not what he wants to play with today.	Amma ba abin da yake so ya yi wasa da shi a yau ba.
I stood behind.	Na tsaya a baya.
Of course I heard that.	Tabbas na ji haka.
He has no answer.	Ba shi da amsa.
I think you do.	Ina ganin kuna yi.
I hope she hears.	Ina fatan za ta ji.
Be honest with yourself.	Ku kasance masu gaskiya da kanku.
Three said he would try.	Uku yace zai gwada.
They will wait for you.	Za su jira ku.
In two days he will return and take them away.	Nan da kwana biyu zai dawo ya tafi da su.
We recognize it.	Mun gane shi.
The dog must stand outside.	Dole ne kare ya tsaya a waje.
The day of the moon.	Ranar wata.
I can change that.	Zan iya canza hakan.
He got this.	Ya samu wannan.
If you do not agree with me, go ahead.	Idan ba ku yarda da ni ba, ku ci gaba.
Let me see.	Bari in gani.
No one can do it alone.	Babu wanda zai iya yin shi kadai.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
I will be too.	Ni ma zan kasance.
Learn everything you can about them.	Koyi duk abin da za ku iya game da su.
But he went further.	Amma ya kara gaba.
It is not comfortable.	Shi babu dadi.
I will protect you.	Zan kare ku.
We are fine.	Mun yi lafiya.
Like I could walk that way.	Kamar zan iya tafiya haka.
We do this twice.	Muna yin wannan sau biyu.
I don't know what else.	Ban san me kuma ba.
They told you not to come yet.	Suka ce maka kar ka zo tukuna.
They say little.	Suka ce kadan.
They can be useful.	Suna iya zama da amfani.
It should.	Ya kamata.
She is not alone, but she is alone.	Ba ita kaɗai ba ce, amma ita kaɗai ce.
She has to do it now.	Dole ta yi yanzu.
You can enjoy them.	Kuna iya jin daɗin su.
He also did not know what was going on.	Shi ma bai san me ke faruwa ba.
Nothing has changed over the years.	Babu wani abu da ya canza tsawon shekaru.
Everything is as real as it is now.	Komai na gaske ne kamar yadda yake a yanzu.
It was written several years ago, and appears to not work.	An rubuta shi shekaru da yawa da suka gabata, kuma ya bayyana baya aiki.
We just apologize.	Mu yi hakuri kawai.
I prepared well for the heavy rain.	Na shirya sosai don ruwan sama mai yawa.
Leave her alone.	Ka bar ta.
He is a man who 'can do it'.	Mutum ne 'zai iya yi'.
Maybe he is known.	Wataƙila an san shi.
We must not forget about this game.	Dole ne mu manta game da wannan wasan.
The same is true all the time.	Haka abin yake kowane lokaci.
Now what? 	Yanzu me?
I'll come back to that.	Zan dawo kan haka.
This is not common, of course.	Wannan ba kowa bane, ba shakka.
Until she did.	Har sai da ta yi.
He can’t think of sitting in a place alone, though.	Ba zai iya tunanin zama a wuri shi kadai ba, ko da yake.
Now so too.	Yanzu haka ma.
It's over, it's done.	Ya wuce, an yi.
I said go.	Na ce ku tafi.
We really get in the car and play.	Da gaske muna shiga motar mu yi wasa.
How could he forget?	Ta yaya zai manta?
He will not fail us.	Ba zai kasa mu ba.
We were never one.	Ba mu taɓa zama ɗaya ba.
They even started to be useless.	Har suka fara da rashin amfani.
Mu ma.	Mu ma.
I want to run and drink water.	Ina so in gudu in sha ruwa.
There was never a killer.	Ba a taba samun wanda ya kashe shi ba.
No cars were seen.	Babu wata motar da aka gani.
Come back.	Koma ni baya.
A year before.	Shekara daya kafin.
I would like to have dinner.	Ina son jin abincin dare.
He wanted to stay home.	Ya so ya zauna ya yi gida.
Of course not just on that.	Tabbas ba akan haka kawai ba.
I took the second route.	Na dauki hanya ta biyu.
Don’t try to write to many people at once.	Kada ka yi ƙoƙarin rubuta wa mutane da yawa lokaci guda.
They think we will work.	Suna tsammanin za mu yi aiki.
I can't tell him.	Ba zan iya gaya masa ba.
We want to do it, so we do it.	Muna so mu yi shi, don haka mu yi shi.
I can't miss you.	Ba zan iya rasa ku ba.
I will ask you a lot.	Zan tambaye ku da yawa.
It is an opportunity to do so.	Wata dama ce ta yin hakan.
I'm happy today.	Na yi farin ciki a yau.
I wonder if they ever thought of us that way.	Ina mamakin ko sun taba tunanin mu haka.
But that never happened.	Amma hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
He does this regularly.	Yana yin haka kullum.
And they were.	Kuma sun kasance.
There must be an error here somewhere.	Dole ne a sami kuskure a nan wani wuri.
If we can't name it, we won't think much of it.	Idan ba za mu iya ba da suna ba, ba za mu yi tunani sosai game da shi ba.
You can imagine what happens next.	Kuna iya tunanin abin da ya faru a gaba.
Anything.	Duk wani abu.
You must write it down.	Dole ne ku rubuta shi.
I have to apologize.	Dole ne in yi hakuri.
Or she came to him.	Ko ta zo masa.
This is a good country.	Wannan kasa ce mai kyau.
Tell me, tell me.	Fada mani, fada mani.
Enough, and it will probably be fine.	Ya isa, kuma tabbas zai yi kyau.
And so on.	Da sauran.
I don't think he's there yet.	Bana jin yana can tukuna.
I did not try.	Ban gwada ba.
I would have died tonight.	Da na mutu a daren nan.
Is there a sign here? 	Akwai alama a nan?
We did a little.	Mun yi kadan.
Ask them what they want and why.	Tambaye su abin da suke so kuma me yasa.
So we do nothing.	Don haka ba mu yin komai.
They love it.	Suna son shi.
We are almost done here.	Mun kusan gama nan.
Yet it came to you.	Amma duk da haka ta zo gare ku.
I can't get close to them.	Ba zan iya zuwa kusa da su ba.
I want to be better tomorrow.	Ina so in zama mafi kyau gobe.
I am somewhere else.	Ina wani wuri kuma.
If we don’t get it now, we will never get it.	Idan ba mu samu yanzu ba, ba za mu taba samu ba.
We know what we can do here.	Mun san abin da za mu iya yi a nan.
I was in it until then.	Ina nan a ciki har lokacin.
Like we were worried.	Kamar mun damu.
I highly recommend this book.	Ina ba da shawarar wannan littafin sosai.
He can't do that.	Ba zai iya yin wannan ba.
She will be happy here.	Za ta yi farin ciki a nan.
On the go.	A kan tafiya.
I didn’t think it was a big deal.	Ban yi tsammanin abu ne mai girma ba.
And you need to remember it.	Kuma kana bukatar ka tuna da shi.
Just do it right for you.	Kawai yi muku daidai.
But still he did not give up.	Amma duk da haka bai bari ba.
They wanted me in the best school they said.	Sun so ni a makaranta mafi kyau suka ce.
Two children are in school.	Yara biyu suna makaranta.
No, do not cover.	A'a, kar a rufe.
This time he could not do better.	Wannan lokacin ba zai iya yin kyau ba.
So they stayed that way for a long time.	Haka suka dade a haka.
In this is the other way around.	A cikin wannan ita ce sauran hanyar.
She said she could immediately say something was wrong.	Ta ce nan da nan za ta iya cewa wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
There will be a second.	Za a yi na biyu.
I still love you.	Har yanzu ina son ku.
You still care.	Har yanzu kuna kula.
She could not think of eating.	Ta kasa tunanin cin abinci.
As usual, she was right.	Kamar yadda aka saba, ta yi gaskiya.
Let me explain her name.	Bari in bayyana sunan ta.
I decided to have this time.	Na yanke shawarar samun wannan lokacin.
What happened next.	Me ya faru bayan haka.
This is a trip.	Wannan tafiya ce.
And now, here we are.	Kuma yanzu, ga mu nan.
I got this	Na samu wannan
He prepared me.	Ya shirya min.
Of course he would never do that.	Tabbas ba zai taba yin hakan ba.
I agree with two things.	Na yarda da abubuwan biyu.
Maybe I don’t have much time.	Wataƙila ba ni da lokaci mai yawa.
How to come back.	Yadda zata dawo.
Some people don’t get it.	Wasu mutane ba sa samun shi.
And how much I missed.	Kuma nawa ne na rasa.
Probably not, though.	Wataƙila ba haka ba ne, ko da yake.
It is a difficult problem.	Matsala ce mai wahala.
I’m curious to see if he can keep going.	Ina sha'awar ganin ko zai iya ci gaba da tafiya.
He came out and ran upstairs.	Ya fito da gudu yana tashi sama.
This is often in the form of money.	Wannan sau da yawa yana cikin hanyar kuɗi.
I started to look good and not good.	Na fara ganin mai kyau kuma ba mai kyau ba.
And nothing.	Kuma babu komai.
All you have to do is ask me.	Duk abin da za ku yi shi ne ku tambaye ni.
What is your favorite food?	Wane irin abinci kuka fi so?
That's how we arrived.	A haka muka isa.
It's so funny.	Yana da ban dariya sosai.
As you know.	Kamar yadda kuka sani.
They are doing well.	Suna yin kyau.
Food is available.	Abinci yana nan.
We have been married for two years now.	Mun yi aure shekara biyu yanzu.
But, one has to be what he really is.	Amma, ya kamata mutum ya zama ainihin abin da yake.
We never talked.	Ba mu taɓa yin magana ba.
We will be here when you need us.	Za mu kasance a nan lokacin da kuke buƙatar mu.
When you heard there was nothing there.	Lokacin da kuka ji babu komai a wurin.
Wait a few more.	Jira wasu ƙarin.
Please log in with username.	Da fatan za a shiga da sunan mai amfani.
He thinks they got it.	Yana ganin sun samu.
Without me.	Ba tare da ni ba.
So that's what we did.	Don haka abin da muka yi ke nan.
Of course it should.	Tabbas ya kamata.
It makes them happy.	Yana sa su ji daɗi.
I have no help to make calls.	Ba ni da taimako don yin kira.
Not us, it's so open.	Ba mu, yana da haka bude.
Still not ready to go out.	Har yanzu bata shirya fita ba.
God, she has nothing.	Allah, ba ta da wani abu.
And it is not necessarily that no one has seen.	Kuma ba lallai ba ne cewa babu wanda ya gani.
But it is life and we accept it.	Amma ita rayuwa kuma mun yarda da ita.
I think she wants to.	Ina jin tana so.
If they are not paid.	Idan ba a biya su ba.
It's not even good.	Bai ma yi kyau ba.
I think she was.	Ina tsammanin ta kasance.
It gets a little rain, but there is rain.	Yana samun ruwan sama kaɗan, amma akwai ruwa.
On it he went.	Akan shi ya tafi.
This may take a few more months.	Wannan na iya ɗaukar wasu ƙarin wata.
I'll give you another, equally good.	Zan ba ku wani, daidai da kyau.
You should meet him.	Ya kamata ku hadu da shi.
And, of course.	Kuma, ba shakka,.
They keep thinking about it.	Suka zauna suna tunanin hakan.
He is a man.	Mutum ne .
Nothing prepared him for the feeling he was feeling right now.	Babu wani abu da ya shirya shi don jin da yake ji a yanzu.
Everything else he said, however, was incorrect.	Duk sauran abin da ya ce, duk da haka, ba daidai ba ne.
This is what happened in the article.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya faru a cikin labarin.
They covered her.	Suka rufe ta.
Call them and ask.	Ka kira su ka tambaye.
I do not know how to do it.	Ban san yadda zan yi ba.
It's a beautiful sight.	Wani kyakkyawan gani ne.
I think this works really well.	Ina tsammanin wannan yana aiki sosai.
And maybe he was right.	Kuma watakila ya yi gaskiya.
Nothing is left to right.	Ba abin da aka bari a dama.
I hope someone kills her.	Ina fata wani ya kashe ta.
She spoke so loudly.	Ta fad'a sosai.
There is only the first if there is a second '.	Akwai kawai na farko idan akwai na biyu'.
This is true.	Wannan gaskiya ne.
Both hands are among the winners.	Hannu biyu suka daga cikin nasara.
But it was not.	Amma bai kasance ba.
I will not lie.	Ba zan yi karya ba.
And she wouldn't know that until she left.	Kuma ba za ta san haka ba sai ta tafi.
So that surprised me.	Don haka abin ya bani mamaki.
No one was sure, so he said nothing.	Babu wanda ya tabbata, don haka bai ce komai ba.
It does not pay.	Ba ya biya.
If so someone can show me how.	Idan haka ne wani zai iya nuna mani yadda.
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.	Lallai ban tabbata ko hakan abu ne mai kyau ko a'a ba.
Do it carefully.	Yi shi a hankali.
You can finally find them here.	Kuna iya samun su a ƙarshe a nan.
What a life.	Me rayuwa.
He took some joy out of it.	Ya cire wani farin ciki daga ciki.
It feels good.	Yana jin dadi.
It actually allows you to watch what you like and when you want.	Ainihin yana ba ku damar kallon abin da kuke so da lokacin da kuke so.
I hope to know you better.	Ina fatan in san ku da kyau.
Lots of fear.	Yawan tsoro.
This man took her.	Wannan mutumin ya tafi da ita.
At the time he said everything was fine.	A lokacin yace komai yayi kyau.
And at the same time that we arrested him, he was killed.	Kuma a daidai lokacin da muka kama shi, an kashe shi.
I'll take this again after a bit of sleep.	Zan sake ɗaukar wannan bayan ɗan barci.
I want to talk to her.	Ina so in yi magana da ita.
But it should not be.	Amma bai kamata ba.
And tell me where they want you to go.	Kuma gaya mani inda suke so ku je.
To be real, like any other.	Don zama ainihin, kamar wani.
I no longer eat fish.	Ba na ci kifi kuma.
It may feel like a joke to all of you.	Wataƙila ya ji kamar wasa a gare ku duka.
I can't reach you.	Ba zan iya isa gare ku ba.
They are very fast.	Sun yi sauri sosai.
Nice man, really.	Mutum mai dadi, da gaske.
Everyone knows.	Kowa ya sani.
It's just a walk from where we are.	Tafiya ce kawai daga inda muke.
The same thing happened to me.	Haka abin ya kasance da ni.
I know there are many more.	Na san akwai wasu da yawa.
I can't call tomorrow.	Ba zan iya yin kira ba gobe.
She does not want to go.	Bata son tafiya.
They will be home.	Za su kasance gida.
That did not happen.	Hakan bai faru ba.
I don't feel anyone did.	Bana jin babu wanda yayi.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu wani abu da zai iya wuce ga gaskiya.
.	.
He should go.	Ya kamata ya tafi.
Now they tell me.	Yanzu suna gaya mani.
Many others, he never saw.	Sauran da yawa, bai taba gani ba.
Please, just do it.	Don Allah, yi kawai.
And no.	Kuma ba.
I think he must have forgotten something.	Ina tsammanin dole ne ya manta ko wani abu.
They look so good.	Sun yi kyau sosai.
He did not sign.	Bai sa hannu ba.
So life went on.	Don haka rayuwa ta tafi.
It was for a while and somewhere.	Ya kasance na wani lokaci kuma wani wuri.
Then meet her.	Sai ka hadu da ita.
Nothing to show.	Babu wani abu da ya nuna.
No one knows what happened there.	Babu wanda ya san abin da ya faru a wurin.
I do not want to say anything.	Ba na son in ce da komai.
I began to think about how they did it.	Na fara tunanin yadda suke yi.
It also hurts.	Hakan ma yayi zafi.
Children are sick.	Yara ba su da lafiya.
I am interested in you.	Ina sha'awar ku.
I do not know what the future holds for me.	Ban san abin da zai faru nan gaba a gare ni ba.
But as usual, there is work to be done.	Amma kamar yadda aka saba, akwai aikin da za a yi.
Absolutely no one.	Lallai babu kowa.
She told him she was pregnant too.	Ta gaya masa ita ma tana da ciki.
But that was later.	Amma wannan ya kasance daga baya.
I do not know their identity.	Ban san ainihin su ba.
Do not continue.	Kada ya ci gaba.
I want to hear from him.	Ina son ji daga gare shi.
You are not alone.	Ba kai kadai ba.
And you say last.	Kuma ke ce ta ƙarshe.
I am a human being.	Ni mutum ne.
Or accept it.	Ko yarda da shi.
I got a job.	Na samu aiki.
There is a simple answer.	Akwai amsa mai sauƙi.
Maybe you can make him prefer it.	Wataƙila za ku iya sa shi ya fi son shi.
He said nothing for a while.	Bai ce komai ba na dan lokaci.
It is true, however.	Gaskiya ne, duk da haka.
I'm sure you're tired.	Na tabbata kun gaji.
Not all of them.	Ba duka ba ne.
This book is easy to find.	Yana da sauƙi samun wannan littafin.
It could be a global event.	Yana iya zama taron duniya.
I am.	Ni ma.
He also had a second wife.	Ya kuma yi mata ta biyu.
And that's it.	Kuma shi ke nan.
That did not work well.	Hakan bai yi kyau ba.
There is something amazing about them.	Akwai wani abu mai ban mamaki game da su.
Only desire enters my head.	Sha'awa ce kawai ke shiga cikin kaina.
I was afraid to touch anything.	Na ji tsoron taba wani abu.
Surprise me.	Ka bani mamaki.
She is tired and is walking slowly.	Ta gaji tana tafiya a hankali.
But there is so much more.	Amma akwai da yawa fiye da haka.
So is water.	Haka ruwa yake.
And even a few forgot it right away.	Kuma ko ’yan kaɗan sun manta da shi nan da nan.
They will not worry.	Ba za su damu ba.
It makes sense but of course.	Yana da hankali amma tabbas.
It has changed the way success is.	Ya canza yadda nasara ta kasance.
I know this.	Na san wannan.
But if you take the time to come.	Amma idan kun dauki lokaci zuwa .
Time is not right.	Lokaci bai yi daidai ba.
And you made a mistake.	Kuma kun yi kuskure.
Everyone should feel comfortable.	Kamata ya yi kowa ya ji dadi.
But everything went wrong.	Amma duk abin ya tafi ba daidai ba.
Travel the world.	Tafiya a duniya.
But there is something else.	Amma akwai wani abu kuma.
It took a lot of time.	Ya ɗauki lokaci mai yawa.
I have known him for many years.	Na san shi sosai tsawon shekaru da yawa.
Maybe you should stay home today.	Wataƙila ya kamata ku zauna a gida yau.
If not, nothing has happened.	Idan babu, babu abin da ya faru.
There is something wrong here.	Akwai wani abu ba daidai ba a nan.
Maybe she wants to talk.	Wataƙila tana son magana.
You can have it, but you don’t.	Kuna iya samun, amma ba ku yi ba.
This is enough for many, but not all.	Wannan ya isa ga mutane da yawa, amma ba duka ba.
Not involved.	Ba da hannu ba.
In fact, we need both.	A gaskiya, muna bukatar duka biyu.
That must be good.	Dole ne hakan yayi kyau.
That brings us back to the beginning.	Wannan ya dawo mana da mu tun farko.
I know so.	Na san haka ne.
Or he did.	Ko ya yi.
But that has not changed.	Amma har yanzu bai canza ba.
I have to go talk to them.	Dole ne in je magana da su.
Do it really this time.	Yi shi da gaske wannan lokacin.
It looks so good.	Ya yi kyau sosai.
She asked him the story.	Ta tambaye shi labarin.
I'm trying to get interested.	Ina ƙoƙarin yin sha'awar.
Imagine being together.	Ka yi tunanin yadda da mun kasance tare.
It doesn't seem to work though.	Da alama baya aiki ko da yake.
They can be scary and dishonest.	Suna iya zama masu ban tsoro da rashin gaskiya.
We'll talk about that in a moment.	Za mu dan yi magana kan hakan nan da wani lokaci kadan.
Maybe they will continue to do so for years, too.	Wataƙila za su ci gaba da yin hakan shekaru da yawa, su ma.
Sometimes we have to apologize.	Wani lokaci sai mu yi hakuri.
All of these are good.	Duk waɗannan suna da kyau.
I haven’t thought about this book in years.	Ban yi tunani game da wannan littafin ba tsawon shekaru.
You have to accept that, too.	Dole ne ku yarda da hakan, kuma.
He didn't want to say.	Bai so ya fada ba.
Take care of your safety.	Kula da kare ku.
You work a lot.	Kuna aiki da yawa.
I need a little.	Ina bukata kadan.
For many people, this is a big deal.	Ga mutane da yawa, wannan babban abu ne.
They have girls.	Suna da 'yan mata.
I have nothing and I have nothing to answer him with.	Ba ni da komai kuma babu abin da zan amsa masa da shi.
Some of my stuff is in the big house.	Wasu abubuwa na suna nan a babban gida.
We need players.	Muna bukatar 'yan wasa.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
It works better than anything.	Ya fi yin aiki fiye da komai.
It's so good.	Yana da kyau haka.
I want to hear something.	Ina so in ji wani abu.
I know her.	Na san ta.
So, that can't happen.	Don haka, hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
He can't get it.	Ba zai iya samu ba.
We do not understand it, but it is true.	Ba mu gane shi ba, amma gaskiya ne.
They make her eat everything they eat.	Suna sa mata ta ci duk abin da suke ci.
I hated myself.	Na ƙi kaina.
Anyone can turn on these tools.	Kowa na iya kunna waɗannan kayan aikin.
I remember crying.	Na tuna kuka.
They help you point out the problem.	Suna taimaka muku nuna matsalar.
We must stand together.	Dole ne mu tsaya tare.
I would love to hear more.	Zan yi sha'awar jin ƙarin.
We live to work.	Muna rayuwa don yin aiki.
There is no place to do anything else.	Babu wurin yin wani abu kuma.
But it’s not as good as you feel, man.	Amma ba shi da kyau kamar yadda kuke ji, mutum.
Kids love it.	Yara suna son ta.
He left it at that.	Ya bar muku haka.
I will not do it.	Ba zan yi ba.
Just me.	Ni kawai.
Let others do whatever they say.	Bari wasu su yi duk abin da suka ce.
I was wrong.	Na yi kuskure.
So I do not know what he is doing.	Don haka ban san abin da yake yi ba.
There must be something we can do.	Dole ne akwai abin da za mu iya yi.
I hope so, for myself.	Ina fata haka, don kaina.
But at the time he should not have done much about it.	Amma a lokacin bai kamata ya yi wani abu da yawa game da shi ba.
Either way, we will worry about that when we come to him.	Ko ta yaya, za mu damu da hakan idan muka zo gare shi.
I saw it today.	Na gani yau.
It doesn't matter what people think.	Ba komai abin da mutane suke tunani ba.
Not exactly the best use of money.	Ba daidai ba ne mafi kyawun amfani da kuɗi.
And he did the same.	Kuma ya yi irin haka.
We talked for a while, drank coffee together.	Mun dan yi magana, muka sha kofi tare.
But one has to look very carefully.	Amma dole ne mutum ya duba sosai.
One thing to keep in mind though.	Abu daya da ya kamata a tuna ko da yake.
Actually, this is nothing new.	A gaskiya, wannan ba sabon abu ba ne.
The same is true now.	Haka abin yake a yanzu.
I can do all this.	Zan iya yin duk wannan.
Join one.	Shiga guda ɗaya.
He had heard all this before.	Ya taba jin wannan duka a baya.
There is no heat there.	Babu zafi a wurin.
I closed that.	Na rufe hakan.
She has to get it.	Dole ta samu.
Nice meal, though.	Abincin da ya dace, ko da yake.
We have to get out there.	Dole ne mu fita can.
You can be seen.	Ana iya ganin ku.
Immediately the door opened.	Nan take kofar ta bude.
One day he thought.	Wata rana ya yi tunani.
She was a huge success at the festival.	Ta kasance babban cin nasara a bikin.
No place, no one changed that.	Babu wuri, babu wanda ya canza wannan.
We did the right thing by doing that.	Mun yi daidai da yin haka.
You can not describe how things will be.	Ba za ku iya bayyana yadda abubuwa za su kasance ba.
The police are asking for help.	'Yan sanda na neman taimako.
I will not speak.	Ba zan yi magana ba.
I think this is a great movie.	Ina tsammanin wannan babban fim ne.
I think that would be very appropriate for him.	Ina tsammanin hakan zai dace da shi sosai.
He got up early and went to work early.	Ya tashi da wuri ya tafi aiki da wuri.
But not only that.	Amma ba haka kawai ba.
They just use it.	Suna amfani da shi kawai.
It was a lie, nothing, she thought.	Karya ce, ba komai, ta yi tunani.
I have made progress slowly.	Na samu ci gaba a hankali.
Come and give me something.	Ku zo ku ba ni wani abu.
Sometimes these are.	Wani lokaci waɗannan su ne.
The whole world knows this.	Duk duniya ta san wannan.
I like to talk to people.	Ina son yin magana da mutane.
Would you please do this for me?	Don Allah za a iya yi min wannan?
The man worked on everything.	Mutumin ya yi aiki a kan komai.
You have a good idea here.	Kuna da kyakkyawan tunani a nan.
This, however, is not unreasonable.	Wannan, duk da haka, bai dace da hankali ba.
One does not need to know.	Mutum bashi da bukatar sani.
It looks like though.	Yana kama amma.
So he knew.	Don haka sai ya sani.
Sleep will not make him go away.	Barci ba zai sa ya tafi ba.
There are a few people about.	Akwai 'yan mutane game da.
That never happened.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
She ate very little.	Kad’an kad’an ta ci.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
He knew she wouldn't believe him, of course.	Ya san ba za ta yarda da shi ba, tabbas.
Whether he wants money.	Ko yana son kudi.
It's weak.	Yana da rauni.
He stood waiting for an answer.	Ya tsaya yana jiran amsa.
No one knows how to fix it.	Babu wanda ya san yadda za a gyara shi.
We will help you with that.	Za mu taimake ku da hakan.
This is completely out of hand.	Wannan gaba daya ya fita daga hannu.
But stop it.	Amma tsaya da shi.
I told you where.	Na gaya muku a ina.
So it was prepared.	Don haka aka shirya.
It is coming to us.	Yana zuwa mana.
There are a few of the latter.	Akwai kaɗan daga cikin na ƙarshe.
They have a lot to worry about.	Suna da yawa da za su damu.
Remember that the plane is taking off by moving forward.	Ka tuna cewa jirgin sama yana tashi ta hanyar tafiya gaba.
She came to her rescue.	Ta zo ta kare.
Mu ma.	Mu ma.
Now is not the time to fight, we do not need to know.	Yanzu ba lokacin faɗa ba ne, ba sai mun ƙara sani ba.
What did he just say?	Me ya ce kawai?
Then she got up from there.	Sai ta tashi daga nan.
This fight is over.	Wannan fada ya kare.
In the end it does not matter.	A ƙarshe ba komai.
A young boy is missing.	An rasa wani yaro yaro.
You have to say when to run.	Dole ne ku fada lokacin da za ku gudu.
Last night I.	Daren jiya na.
But there is no time now.	Amma babu lokaci yanzu.
I must say they left a lot to be desired.	Dole ne in ce sun bar abubuwa da yawa da ake so.
There is not much you can do to fix this problem.	Babu wani abu da yawa da za ku iya yi don gyara wannan matsalar.
They spent their day with me.	Sun yi ranar su tare da ni.
Here he sat, thinking.	Nan ya zauna yana tunani.
I just love it.	Ina son shi kawai.
They are also familiar with it.	Su ma sun saba da shi.
She is not eating.	Bata cin abinci.
Nothing happens except the normal.	Ba abin da ke faruwa sai abin da aka saba.
I got up after him.	Na tashi bayan shi.
Like it or not.	Kuna son shi ko ku ƙi shi.
For simplicity, we take the latter.	Don sauƙi, muna ɗauka na ƙarshe.
We need a safe place to sleep.	Muna bukatar wurin kwana lafiya.
She almost did.	Ta kusa yi.
But they are healthy, happy and happy.	Amma suna da lafiya, farin ciki da jin daɗi.
I have to accept that.	Sai na yarda da hakan.
And we need you here.	Kuma muna bukatar ku a nan.
Man travels on the moon.	Mutum ya yi tafiya a kan wata.
But no, of course not.	Amma a'a, tabbas ba haka bane.
And although we continue as before, it is not.	Kuma ko da yake mun ci gaba kamar da, ba haka ba ne.
But not all.	Amma ba duka ba.
Lots of kids, little food.	Yara da yawa, abinci kaɗan.
I'm glad I liked it.	Na yi farin cikin son sa.
Looking for answers.	Neman amsa.
I came up with this project.	Na zo da wannan aikin.
They do not feel comfortable.	Ba sa jin dadi.
He left before dinner time.	Ya fita kafin lokacin cin abinci.
I have to play the game.	Dole ne in buga wasan.
But we had a great time mistake.	Amma mun sami babban lokacin kuskure.
If so they will never work.	Idan haka ne ba za su taba yin aiki ba.
He thought this was a good thing.	Ya dauka wannan abu ne mai kyau.
Keep it there.	A ajiye shi a can.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
Now you say no.	Yanzu ka ce a'a.
Nothing but this.	Ba komai sai wannan.
This person is a worker.	Wannan mutumin mai aiki ne.
We need to be very careful.	Muna bukatar mu mai da hankali sosai.
I don't feel that much anymore.	Ba na jin haka sosai kuma.
It's a little bigger.	Ya dan girma.
It is not enough.	Bai isa sosai ba.
We want to be able to say no.	Muna so mu iya cewa a'a.
She sighed in pain.	Ta fad'a da zafi.
This will be repeated.	Za a sake yin wannan.
Not this ship.	Ba wannan jirgin ba.
I will not enter the road.	Ba zan shiga hanya ba.
You just do not have time.	Kawai ba ku da lokacin.
Something to tell each other.	Wani abu da za su faɗa wa juna.
I'll just call the police.	Zan kira 'yan sanda kawai.
This is not the first time, he said.	Wannan ba shine karo na farko ba, in ji shi.
Now he has grown to be more than that.	Yanzu ya girma ya zama fiye da haka.
Obviously, this is not true.	Babu shakka, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Give us a call today.	Ka ba mu kira zuwa yau.
No one will hear what you say except me.	Ba wanda zai ji abin da kuke faɗa sai ni.
It's not like they can't do it, or it seems like they haven't done it before.	Ba kamar ba za su iya ba, ko kuma kamar ba su yi a baya ba.
Everything was as it should be.	Duk ya kasance kamar yadda ya kamata.
Anyone can work.	Kowa na iya yin aiki.
Some are good.	Wasu suna da kyau.
But this is not necessary.	Amma wannan ba lallai ba ne.
But he did not know that he had gone.	Amma bai san ya tafi ba.
For it should be weak.	Don yakamata ya kasance mai rauni.
There are other good things as well.	Akwai sauran abubuwa masu kyau kuma.
It will never happen again.	Ba zai sake faruwa ba.
And it certainly was.	Kuma lallai ya kasance.
We can cut it.	Za mu iya yanke shi.
Maybe we even know better.	Wataƙila mu ma mun fi sani.
She is everywhere.	Ta ko ina.
People know him.	Mutane sun san shi.
A woman called her.	Wata mata ta kira ta.
Wait a moment though.	Jira na ɗan lokaci ko.
It hurts to talk.	Yayi zafi magana.
She left the door open.	Ta bar kofar a bude.
From where it can be useful though.	Daga ina zai iya zama da amfani ko da yake.
Every day.	A kowace rana.
Probably true.	Wataƙila gaskiya ne.
That is why we will never do it again.	Abin da ya sa ba za mu sake yin hakan ba.
And it is one of the best things.	Kuma yana daya daga cikin mafi kyawun abubuwa.
She is well known.	An san ta gaba ɗaya.
They were all amazed.	Su duka suka yi mamaki.
I let him do whatever he wanted with me.	Na bar shi ya yi min duk abin da yake so.
And they looked at it, it worked.	Kuma sun duba shi, yana aiki.
He hit him twice.	Ya buga masa sau biyu.
When it is colder.	Lokacin da ya fi sanyi.
They are given for everything.	An ba su don komai.
I have no answer for that.	Bani da amsa akan haka.
I do not want anyone to see this.	Ba na son kowa ya ga wannan.
This is what the two did before they met.	Haka su biyu suke tun kafin su hadu da juna.
Will the bus come more often?	Shin bas ɗin zai fi zuwa sau da yawa?
This game has been fun.	Wannan wasan ya kasance mai daɗi.
Call me when you get this.	Kira ni idan kun sami wannan.
And she can say that she definitely loves him.	Kuma za ta iya cewa babu shakka tana son sa.
It seems she can't.	Da alama ba za ta iya ba.
This or you did something wrong.	Wannan ko ka yi wani abu ba daidai ba.
But that did him good.	Amma wannan yayi masa kyau.
It will take you three days.	Zai kai ku kwana uku.
He decided to get involved again.	Ya yanke shawarar sake shiga ciki.
I waited all year.	Na jira duk shekara.
But give it a try.	Amma a gwada.
Talk about women.	Magana akan mata.
Two can play as easily as one.	Biyu suna iya yin wasa cikin sauƙi kamar ɗaya.
I'll check that.	Zan duba hakan.
He does so and has great success.	Yana yin haka kuma yana da nasara mai kyau.
There is absolutely nothing that one can do for him.	Lallai babu abin da mutum zai iya yi masa.
But he was there.	Amma ya kasance a can.
I can make you pay.	Zan iya sa ku biya.
Sometimes other things happen.	Wani lokaci wasu abubuwa suna faruwa.
Less than a year later.	Bai wuce shekara guda ba.
He will sit down after he sits down.	Zai zauna bayan ya zauna.
But be careful.	Amma ku yi hankali.
Not necessarily.	Ba lallai ba ne.
He is also a man with two wives.	Shi ne mutumin da yake da mata biyu kuma.
Your suggestion.	Shawarar ku ce.
But no one is playing this game for money.	Amma babu wanda ke yin wannan wasa don kuɗi.
She is the only one, they said.	Ita ce kawai, suka ce.
Indeed, it may even prove useless.	Lallai, yana iya ma nuna rashin amfani.
It was very cold that day.	An yi sanyi sosai a ranar.
He seems to understand.	Da alama ya gane.
So don't worry.	Don haka kada ku damu.
They will not stand on nothing to get what they want.	Ba za su tsaya a kan komai ba don samun abin da suke so.
They talked about such a thing.	Sun yi magana a kan irin wannan abu.
I'm happy to like them.	Na yi farin cikin son su.
To think before she works.	Don tunani kafin ta yi aiki.
Not that progress though.	Ba cewa ci gaba ba ko da.
There is only play.	Akwai wasa kawai.
She made a mistake again.	Ta yi kuskure kuma.
In the end, they decided to leave.	A ƙarshe, suka yanke shawarar barin.
It's a good thing.	Abu ne mai kyau.
They were happy on the first day.	Sun yi farin ciki a ranar farko.
I hope he can fall asleep early today.	Ina fatan zai iya yin barci da wuri yau.
I was also surprised though.	Ina ma mamaki ko.
So it's good now.	Don haka yana da kyau yanzu.
But one should, of course.	Amma wanda ya isa, tabbas.
Sorry it won't happen.	Yi hakuri ba zai faru ba.
The work was not done.	Ba a yi aikin ba.
So we should not be able to.	Don haka bai kamata mu iya ba.
But only for you.	Amma a gare ku kawai.
There is nothing wrong here.	Babu kuskure a nan.
I don't feel finished.	Bana jin an gama.
This will prove to be the best person.	Wannan zai tabbatar da wanda ya fi kyau mutum.
You will answer me, though.	Za ka amsa mani, ko da yake.
Now let me speak.	Yanzu bari in yi magana.
Turn on the hot water.	Kunna ruwan zafi.
This is a really good thing.	Wannan abu ne mai kyau gaske.
It's outside.	Yana waje.
We need to get help for these girls.	Muna buƙatar samun taimako ga waɗannan 'yan mata.
Time allows for reflection.	Lokaci yana ba da damar yin tunani.
Now do something about it.	Yanzu yi wani abu game da shi.
So do they.	Haka kuma dole su.
And it worked.	Kuma ya yi aiki.
No one touched her, though she passed by others.	Ba wanda ya taɓa ta, ko da yake ta wuce kusa da wasu.
The real work is at night.	Ainihin aikin shine da dare.
Let them be a sign.	Bari su zama alama.
He suffered.	Ya sha wahala.
Do not go where indicated.	Kar a je wurin da aka nuna.
Where anything can happen.	Inda wani abu zai iya faruwa.
She hit it off.	Ta buga shi.
Wedding, or just a walk.	Bikin aure, ko tafiya tafiya kawai.
We'd better get off here soon.	Gara mu tashi daga nan da sauri.
She was very helpful.	Ta taimaka sosai.
I really like it, really.	Ina son shi sosai, a gaskiya.
He works there.	Yana aiki a can.
We feel funny about it.	Muna jin ban dariya game da shi.
We love you guys.	Muna son ku mutane.
I just closed it.	Na rufe shi kawai.
There is probably no better way.	Wataƙila babu wata hanyar da za ta dace sosai.
Two years are still waiting for that.	Shekaru biyu har yanzu ana jiran hakan.
But they are children.	Amma su yara ne.
That must be it.	Dole ne hakan ya kasance.
I have it there.	Ina da shi a can.
What more can be said.	Me kuma za a iya cewa.
I returned to work alone.	Na dawo aiki ni kadai.
And surprisingly.	Kuma abin mamaki.
They did well.	Sun yi kyau.
He said nothing to her.	Bai ce mata komai ba.
It doesn't make you smarter, you know.	Ba ya sa ka zama mai hankali, ka sani.
And it is time.	Kuma lokaci ne.
We used to do well.	Mun kasance muna yin kyau.
I just love them.	Ina son su kawai.
Someone will go.	Wani zai tafi.
Must be started immediately.	Dole ne a fara nan da nan.
It will not be helpful.	Ba za ta kasance taimako ba.
Everything will die.	Komai zai mutu.
They will help next weekend.	Za su taimaka karshen mako mai zuwa.
However, two years ago, we had a similar problem.	Duk da haka, shekaru biyu da suka wuce, mun sami irin wannan matsala.
However, not everyone agrees.	Duk da haka, ba kowa ya yarda ba.
Plaintiff did not do so here.	Mai kara bai yi haka ba a nan.
In fact we should turn it into a tool.	A gaskiya ya kamata mu mai da shi a cikin kayan aiki.
I am not the only one who can do this.	Ba ni kaɗai zan iya yin hakan ba.
I got out of the way.	Na fita daga hanya.
But of course we should not.	Amma tabbas bai kamata mu yi ba.
We need the best we can, and we need them fast.	Muna buƙatar mafi kyawun abin da za mu iya samu, kuma muna buƙatar su da sauri.
It’s just something to protect me from anyone.	Kawai wani abu ne don kare ni daga kowa.
As you can see, this did not happen.	Kamar yadda kuke gani hakan bai faru ba.
So let's start doing that.	Don haka bari mu fara yin hakan.
I was afraid it would happen.	Na ji tsoron hakan zai faru.
Nothing added.	Babu wani abu da aka kara.
Many things happen at the same time.	Abubuwa da yawa suna faruwa a lokaci guda.
She will be there.	Za ta kasance a wurin.
But do nothing.	Amma kada ku yi komai.
He should never go out again.	Kada ya sake fita waje.
If anything changes, let me know when you call tonight.	Idan wani abu ya canza, gaya mani lokacin da kuka kira daren yau.
It does not fit.	Bai dace ba.
They are not prepared.	Ba a shirya su ba.
Now is the time to act.	Yanzu ne lokacin aiki.
Apparently the man did not hear it.	Da alama mutumin bai ji shi ba.
You are very close.	Kun kasance kusa sosai.
Although sad, it is healthy.	Ko da yake bakin ciki, yana da lafiya.
I never went there today.	Ban taba zuwa can ba yau.
Take the bus to the station.	Dauki bas zuwa tashar.
Money is dead.	Kudi ya mutu.
Do not pay attention to it.	Kada ku kula da shi.
I could add a lot of things he didn’t know.	Na iya ƙara abubuwa da yawa da bai iya sani ba.
I arrive home.	Ina isa gida.
This can sometimes be undesirable.	Wannan na iya zama wani lokaci ba abin so ba.
I will use them again.	Zan sake amfani da su.
The best thing I did for myself.	Mafi kyawun abin da na yi wa kaina.
The stomach is not interesting.	Cikin ciki ba shi da ban sha'awa.
I should just let go.	Ya kamata in bari kawai.
They are the real driving force.	Su ne ainihin abin tuƙi.
I do not see how we can do it.	Ban ga yadda za mu iya yi ba.
Do this several times.	Yi wannan sau da yawa.
They should have run, they were running from this place.	Kamata ya yi su gudu, suna gudu daga wannan wuri.
Be right back.	Ina zuwa.
He said he killed him.	Ya ce ya kashe shi.
He immediately got up and opened the door.	Nan take ya tashi zai bude kofar.
It is enough to ask her.	Ya isa ya tambaye ta.
It is good to see that.	Yana da kyau ya ga haka.
No one expected him to return as he is now.	Babu wanda ya yi tsammanin zai dawo kamar yadda yake a yanzu.
He just needs to keep thinking positively.	Yana bukatar kawai ya ci gaba da tunani daidai.
And there it is.	Kuma akwai.
The project was a success.	Aikin ya yi nasara.
She knows how to put on a song.	Ta san yadda ake saka waƙa.
I want to give a hand	Ina so in ba da hannu
Where he would like to go.	Inda zai so ya tafi.
So far, it’s still early.	Har zuwa yanzu, har yanzu yana da wuri.
Food is life.	Abinci shine rayuwa.
But he did not stop there.	Amma bai tsaya nan ba.
He wanted them all.	Ya so su duka.
I ran to go.	Na gudu don in tafi.
While he was there, one heard something pleasant.	Har yana nan, sai mutum ya ji wani abu mai kyau a wurin.
No one likes it.	Babu wanda yake son shi.
It's not just me.	Ba nawa bane kawai.
This is a difficult thing.	Wannan abu ne mai wuya.
But this is not a problem.	Amma wannan ba matsala ba ne.
That may not be possible.	Wataƙila hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
I was very happy.	Na yi farin ciki sosai.
This is a difficult thing.	Wannan abu ne mai wuya.
Everything was as usual.	Duk ya kasance kamar kullum.
Everything really is not part of what this is.	Duk abin da gaske ba ya cikin abin da wannan yake.
It's late.	Lokaci ya wuce.
There will be another.	Za a yi wani.
Maybe we can't.	Wataƙila ba za mu iya ba.
He has been here for a while.	Ya kasance a nan da ɗan lokaci.
I get the following error.	Ina samun kuskure mai zuwa.
At some point, you need to add water.	A wani lokaci, kuna buƙatar ƙara ruwa.
I went to see what was going on.	Na tafi ne don in ga abin da ke faruwa.
No, one did not.	A'a, daya bai yi ba.
She was behind.	Ta kasance a baya.
He will find out later.	Zai gano wannan a ƙarshe.
You look nice.	Kun yi kyau.
Nothing to do now.	Babu abin yi yanzu.
They are like me and you.	Suna kamar ni da kai.
They would have killed her earlier.	Da sun kashe ta a baya.
Great thing, though.	Abu mai girma, ko da.
It wouldn’t be surprising, no.	Ba zai zama abin mamaki ba, a'a.
He will be upset.	Zai damu.
Otherwise he succeeds.	In ba haka ba ya yi nasara.
You expect a lot from me.	Kuna tsammanin da yawa daga gare ni.
I have to tell someone, everyone.	Dole ne in gaya wa wani, kowa.
There is something new all the time, something more difficult.	Akwai wani sabon abu kowane lokaci, wani abu mafi wuya.
If nothing is lost nothing is found.	Idan babu abin da aka rasa babu wani abu da aka samu.
But this is not real.	Amma wannan ba da gaske ba ne.
But you have to get back to work.	Amma dole ne ku dawo da aikin.
You will learn that you can feel pain.	Za ku koyi cewa za ku iya jin zafi.
The doctor said he would work tomorrow.	Likitan ya ce gobe zai yi aiki.
We look at each other.	Muna kallon juna.
Doing so.	Yin hakan.
She must take care of me.	Dole ne ta kula da ni.
She was very playful, even when she was tired.	Ta kasance mai yawan wasa, ko da ta gaji.
I didn't plan it.	Ban shirya shi ba.
Can you see?	Kuna iya gani?
Which is often more than that.	Wanda sau da yawa fiye da haka gaskiya ne.
He did not answer.	Bai amsa ba.
He didn't even say.	Bai ma fad'a ba.
We got it right.	Mun samu yadda ya kamata.
It will end.	Zai gama.
You should know things like that.	Ya kamata ku san abubuwa kamar haka.
It's very sick.	Yana yawan rashin lafiya.
They come and see.	Suna zuwa suka duba.
Although she should not be really surprised.	Ko da yake bai kamata ta yi mamakin gaske ba.
She laughed at me.	Ta bani dariya.
He started it and told me to join.	Ya fara shi ya ce in shiga.
Tonight is night.	Daren yau ne dare.
You are a true observer and patient.	Kai mai kallon gaskiya ne mai hakuri.
One by one, looking for something out of there.	Daya bayan daya, neman wani abu daga wurin.
Wait, just two.	Jira, biyu ne kawai.
And there is really no place to run.	Kuma da gaske babu wurin gudu.
Absolutely.	Babu shakka.
She is not pregnant.	Ba ta da mai ciki.
We have to try.	Dole ne mu gwada.
You know what is right and what is wrong.	Ka san abin da yake daidai da abin da ba daidai ba.
I want to know what she said.	Ina so in san abin da ta ce.
It just calls.	Yana kira kawai.
He was alone for a while, but the knowledge would come back.	Shi kaɗai na ɗan lokaci, amma sanin za su dawo.
Make sure you have water.	Tabbatar cewa kuna ruwa.
It happened again.	Ya sake faruwa.
I do not know how they do it.	Ban san yadda suke yi ba.
I asked him why he was doing that.	Na tambaye shi me yasa yake yin haka.
It has been changed.	An canza shi.
So put something in there.	Don haka sanya wani abu a can.
They get it.	Suna samun shi.
Cover and leave in a cool place.	Rufe kuma bar a wuri mai sanyi.
He drank a lot of water, although he was not well.	Ya sha ruwa mai yawa, ko da yake ba shi da lafiya.
And that is your problem, not everyone's.	Kuma wannan shine matsalar ku, ba kowa ba.
As we will now.	Kamar yadda za mu yi a yanzu.
She could sit in the living room.	Tana iya zama a dakin da mutane ke sha.
This is a general approach or not.	Wannan hanya ce ta gaba ɗaya ko babu.
He used to drink a lot.	Ya kasance yana sha da yawa.
We change it every week.	Mun canza shi kowane mako.
No wonder there.	Ba abin mamaki bane a can.
I will give him the best name.	Zan ba shi suna mafi kyau.
Nice to hear from you.	Na yi farin cikin ji daga gare ku.
That's what you're used to.	Shine abin da kuka saba.
The car is just a tool.	Mota kayan aiki ne kawai.
But they all did so.	Amma haka duk suka yi.
They should be living a good life.	Ya kamata su kasance suna rayuwa mai kyau.
He lived with her for almost two years.	Ya zauna da ita kusan shekaru biyu.
But he knows a lot.	Amma ya sani da yawa.
We were not told anything.	Ba a gaya mana komai ba.
We can all see that this is wrong.	Duk muna iya ganin cewa wannan ba daidai ba ne.
We need them.	Muna bukatar su.
We were in trouble for a while there.	Mun kasance cikin wahala na ɗan lokaci a can.
It will be a big fight.	Zai zama babban fada.
He fell into a trance.	Ya fad'a cikin fad'a.
It looks like.	Yayi kama.
Do everything to accomplish this.	Yi duk abin da ya cika wannan.
It will not be the last of course.	Ba zai zama na ƙarshe ba shakka.
He just recognized me.	Ya gane ni kawai.
And you never know these things.	Kuma ba ku taɓa sanin waɗannan abubuwa ba.
I really like it here.	Ina son shi a nan sosai.
It happens, it is there.	Yana faruwa, yana can.
Something fishy is happening nearby.	Wani abu mai kifi yana faruwa a kusa da nan.
So they will not.	Don haka ba za su yi ba.
The events never happened.	Abubuwan da suka faru ba su taɓa faruwa ba.
Not great, even nice.	Ba mai girma ba, har ma da kyau.
But that is not going to happen.	Amma hakan ba zai faru ba.
You are also human.	Kai ma mutum.
But he did not.	Amma bai yi haka ba.
It certainly paid off.	Babu shakka ya biya.
They want to hear from you.	Suna son ji daga gare ku.
But do not be discouraged.	Amma kar ka tabbata haka.
Probably nothing.	Wataƙila ba komai ba ne.
I want us to go there.	Ina so mu je can.
We want the world to be a better place.	Muna son duniya ta zama wurin zama mafi kyau.
Domestic flights are the fastest in the world.	Jirgin sama na cikin gida shine mafi girma cikin sauri a duniya.
But the plane did not take off.	Amma jirgin bai tashi ba.
It does two things.	Hakan ya yi abubuwa biyu.
Now two months.	Yanzu wata biyu.
He did not wait for an answer.	Bai jira amsa ba.
You know how it is now.	Kun san yadda ake yi yanzu.
They did not succeed much.	Ba su yi nasara da yawa ba.
It would be amazing.	Zai zama abin ban mamaki.
Nothing unusual.	Ba abin da suka saba.
There is no need to be afraid.	Babu bukatar jin tsoro.
But this is what happened.	Amma abin da ya faru ke nan.
We don’t have a lot of opportunities to go out, and we know it.	Ba mu da dama mai yawa na fita, kuma mun san shi.
One by one the people fell asleep.	Daya bayan daya mutane suka yi barci.
If he stays around for a long time.	Idan ya dade a kusa da shi.
But even though he made us, he did not hate us.	Amma ko da yake shi ya sa mu, bai sa mu ƙi ba.
He got up on his own.	Ya tashi da kansa.
She called the doctor.	Ta kira likitan.
I can not know for sure where it will end.	Ba zan iya sanin tabbas inda zai kare ba.
It kills them.	Yana kashe su.
Many people fled.	Mutane da yawa sun gudu.
You can't miss me.	Ba za ku iya rasa ni ba.
We want to hear.	Muna son ji.
There will be time for that, she knows.	Za a sami lokacin hakan, ta sani.
Without working out as it goes, of course.	Ba tare da yin aiki kamar yadda yake tafiya ba, ba shakka.
Not fake, really.	Ba karya bane, da gaske.
Just to work.	Kawai don yin aiki.
Encounter and look at the person.	Ci karo da kallon mutumin.
I will not leave them.	Ba zan bar su ba.
You know, if you feel.	Ka sani, idan kana ji.
It's time.	Lokaci ya yi.
You must wear this shirt at all times.	Dole ne ku sanya wannan rigar a kowane lokaci.
I do not know exactly what is going on.	Ban san ainihin abin da ke faruwa ba.
There is no reason to write anyone.	Babu dalilin rubuta kowa.
Explain why.	Bayyana dalilin.
That is why they do what they do.	Shi ya sa suke yin abin da suke yi.
He bought a used car.	Ya sayi mota mai amfani.
I think maybe it doesn't work very well.	Ina tsammanin watakila ba ya aiki sosai.
No one saw anything.	Babu wanda ya ga komai.
I do not want to talk further.	Bana son kara magana.
One morning, one afternoon.	Daya da safe, daya da rana.
Food is empty.	Kayan abinci babu kowa.
She could not say that it was mine.	Ta kasa cewa nawa ne.
He knows you are sad.	Ya san kana cikin bakin ciki.
He used to focus on the past.	Ya kasance yana mai da hankali kan abubuwan da suka gabata.
It would be great.	Zai yi kyau sosai.
They don't want anything.	Ba sa son wani abu.
It has been used to make a lot of it.	An yi amfani da shi don a yi shi da yawa.
And it completely failed.	Kuma gaba daya ya kasa.
I really enjoyed this.	Na ji daɗin wannan sosai.
You cry a lot.	Kuka sosai yayi.
I want to know who did it.	Ina so in san wanda ya yi.
But this has never been seen once.	Amma ba a taba ganin hakan sau daya ba.
Several people were arrested.	An kama mutane da dama.
It moves slowly and fast at the same time.	Yana tafiya a hankali da sauri a lokaci guda.
I lost interest in this game.	Na rasa sha'awar wannan wasan.
But she did not even tell him to call.	Amma bata ko kira ta fada masa ba.
And now, enough to say, you are tired.	Kuma yanzu, isa ya ce, kun gaji.
But this has never been done.	Amma ba a taba yin hakan ba.
And this is entirely as it should be.	Kuma wannan shi ne gaba ɗaya kamar yadda ya kamata.
He wanted that.	Da ya so hakan.
So it went on.	Don haka abin ya ci gaba.
Do not let anyone tell you who you are.	Kada ka bari kowa ya gaya maka ko kai wanene.
So it was.	Haka abin ya kasance.
Maybe we should talk together.	Wataƙila ya kamata mu yi magana tare.
That is a fact.	Gaskiya ne haka.
This in itself may seem like an easy task.	Wannan a kansa yana iya zama kamar aiki mai sauƙi.
Eat your food.	Ku ci abincin ku.
She did well with both.	Ta yi kyau da duka.
What he was saying was a no-brainer for me.	Abin da yake cewa shi ne rashin hankali a gare ni.
We don't use them.	Ba ma amfani da su.
They have nothing to continue.	Ba su da abin da za su ci gaba.
He also did well.	Shi ma ya yi kyau.
This is another time.	Wannan wani lokaci ne.
I don’t know what could be the problem.	Ban san me zai iya zama matsalar ba.
They took advantage of the opportunity.	Sun yi amfani da damar da suka samu.
Two would be better, but one would do.	Biyu zai fi kyau, amma daya zai yi.
I'm tired of you.	Na gaji da ku.
The place is beautiful.	Wurin yana da kyau.
Everyone stops if they get a chance.	Kowa ya tsaya idan ya samu dama.
He could not bear to miss the program.	Ya kasa yarda ya rasa shirin.
I asked for a sign.	Na nemi alama.
You do not eat.	Ba ka ci.
Maybe they still do.	Wataƙila har yanzu suna yi.
It happens.	Yana faruwa.
The usual way.	Hanyar saba da ita.
He showed me where he slept last night.	Ya nuna min inda ya kwana a daren jiya.
This person looks very much like her.	Wannan mutumin yayi kama da ita sosai.
The place is safe enough.	Wurin ya isa lafiya.
I was very excited about this.	Na ji daɗi sosai game da wannan.
He runs in the morning.	Yana gudu da safe.
The same is true for women.	Haka abin ya kasance da mata.
And that's exactly what I needed.	Kuma abin da nake bukata ke nan.
I'm scared now.	Ina jin tsoro yanzu.
I think it passed him by.	Ina tsammanin ya wuce shi.
I called you, but you did not hear me.	Na kira ka, amma ba ka ji ni ba.
You know the country.	Kun san kasa.
It seems to be working fine for the time being.	Da alama yana aiki lafiya don lokacin.
However, he is back.	Duk da haka, ya dawo.
Eventually they will die.	A ƙarshe za su mutu.
I want to make you remember this and everything.	Ina so in sa ku tuna da wannan da komai.
They went to work.	Sun tafi aiki.
It was not until they stopped here.	Sai da suka tsaya a nan.
You are so amazing.	Kun kasance mai ban mamaki sosai.
Bring it back to me.	Ku dawo min da ita.
I wonder if you will grow like them.	Ina mamakin ko za ku girma kamar su.
You made me cry.	Kun sa ni kuka.
Home is home.	Gida gida ne.
They love it here.	Suna son shi a nan.
Still, he would love her.	Duk da haka, zai so ta da gaske.
It has been that way for a long time.	Ya dade a haka.
Of course he told me that.	Tabbas ya bani labarin haka.
Call the police.	Kira 'yan sanda.
So, you have to kill them.	Don haka, kuna da kashe su.
They are not interested because there are very few to do.	Ba su da sha'awar saboda akwai kaɗan da za su yi.
I was a little home.	Na kasance gida kadan.
Do we have to pay for the equipment?	Dole ne mu biya kuɗin kayan aikin?
We will get to that.	Za mu kai ga haka.
Maybe there is really something here.	Wataƙila da gaske akwai wani abu a nan.
In one day.	A rana guda.
We want to be, but no one is interested in us.	Muna so mu kasance, amma babu wanda yake sha'awar mu.
Not one is missing.	Babu ko daya da ya bata.
One person was missing.	Ana cikin haka ne aka rasa mutum daya.
I know such things cannot happen.	Na san irin waɗannan abubuwa ba za su iya faruwa ba.
I did not work.	Ban yi aiki ba.
Maybe one day that will happen.	Watakila wata rana hakan zai faru.
Of course not.	Ko shakka babu.
It's very good, she said.	Yayi kyau sosai, ta ce.
He is gone now.	Ya tafi yanzu.
If only lies are good to take.	Idan karya kawai yana da kyau a ɗauka.
I really do.	Ina yi da gaske.
He lives near this place.	Yana zaune kusa da wannan wuri.
There are so many things to play.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa a wasa.
Maybe we can help each other.	Wataƙila za mu iya taimakon juna.
No more content available.	Babu ƙarin abubuwan da ke akwai.
For a moment.	Na wani lokaci.
It will not change me.	Ba zai canza ni ba.
You can talk about it if you want.	Kuna iya magana game da shi idan kuna so.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
This can be a scary thought.	Wannan na iya zama tunani mai ban tsoro.
She let me touch it.	Ta bar ni in taba shi.
Of course, he did not see anyone.	Tabbas, bai ga kowa ba.
I do not know.	Ban sani ba.
They ran back.	Da gudu suka dawo.
It will explain what is going on.	Zai bayyana abin da ke faruwa.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
Let's assume there is one.	Mu dauka akwai daya.
And a big win, too.	Kuma babban nasara, ma.
Seeing is a thing.	Ganin abu ne.
You are safe with me.	Kuna lafiya tare da ni.
The length of his stay in the cold felt great.	Tsawon da ya yi a cikin sanyi yana jin kansa.
I have two.	Ina da biyu.
You must first be known.	Dole ne a fara sanin ku.
I do not want to go out to dinner.	Ba na son fita cin abincin dare.
She is not alive.	Ba ta da rai.
But they are there.	Amma suna can.
Be careful what you like.	Yi hankali da abin da kuke so.
Actually this statement is not true.	A gaskiya wannan magana ba gaskiya ba ce.
But the truth is the truth.	Amma gaskiya gaskiya ne.
I asked for help	Na nemi taimako
It did not happen overnight, and it is not easy.	Hakan bai faru a rana ɗaya ba kuma ba ta da sauƙi.
Just years.	Kamar shekaru.
I love her and I have never played with her.	Ina son ta kuma ban taba wasa da ita ba.
Not what he wants here.	Ba abin da yake so a nan ba.
Come back up.	Ka dawo sama.
The two things were really the same, after all.	Abubuwan biyu sun kasance da gaske daya, bayan haka.
I like this kind of material.	Ina son irin wannan kayan.
It looks good on me.	Yayi min kyau sosai.
Many people have learned about this difficult path.	Mutane da yawa sun koyi game da wannan hanya mai wuya.
But now they can not just talk about it.	Amma yanzu ba za su iya kawai magana game da shi ba.
I'm glad he will be with me.	Na yi farin ciki zai kasance tare da ni.
I know it can not be easy to find out.	Na san ba zai iya zama da sauƙi samun sani ba.
This is very strange.	Hakan ya yi matukar ban mamaki.
I highly recommend it to everyone.	Ina ba da shawarar sosai ga kowa.
But not like you.	Amma ba kamar ku ba.
Let speech be speech and speech be just, speech.	Bari magana ta zama magana kuma magana ta zama haka kawai, magana.
I recounted their story.	Na sake ba da labarin su.
I want to know more about this.	Ina son ƙarin sani game da wannan.
They know we are killing him.	Sun san cewa muna kashe shi.
That is not enough.	Wannan bai isa ba.
I think it will be a very good thing.	Ina tsammanin zai zama abu mai kyau sosai.
What do you want to see happen.	Me kuke so ku ga yana faruwa.
The sun is out.	Rana ta fita.
But you first.	Amma ku da farko.
Time seems to pass.	Lokaci kamar zai wuce.
He enjoys reading interesting things.	Yana jin daɗin karanta abubuwan ban sha'awa.
And somehow he got lost.	Kuma ko ta yaya ya samu ya rasa.
She left quickly.	Ta tafi da sauri.
I want to do the same.	Ina so in yi haka kuma.
They want something.	Sun so wani abu.
It looks like a beautiful thing.	Ya zama kamar kama mai kyau.
O God truly.	Ya allah da gaske.
It was changed a little later.	An canza kaɗan daga baya.
We will never know.	Ba za mu taɓa sani ba.
It was scary.	Ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
People can be amazing.	Mutane na iya zama masu ban mamaki.
But for now, it will be you.	Amma a yanzu, zai zama ku.
Let’s set a date to talk.	Mu sanya ranar da za mu yi magana.
You laugh a lot when you are happy.	Kuna yawan dariya lokacin da kuke farin ciki.
It is very useful to correct mistakes.	Yana da matukar amfani don gyara kuskure.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Shin kun tabbata kuna son yin hakan?
Ask why they would like or dislike anything.	Tambayi dalilin da yasa za su so ko ba za su so yin kowane abu ba.
I look at them correctly.	Ina kallon su daidai.
We would have done that.	Da mun yi haka.
Then we ate.	Sai mu ci abinci.
Maybe someone will try it.	Wataƙila wani zai gwada shi.
It tests the water, to say the least.	Yana gwada ruwan, don a ce.
Maybe that's true.	Wataƙila hakan gaskiya ne.
You are really close now.	Da gaske kuna kusa yanzu.
What happened happened.	Abin da ya faru ya faru.
If it is a good night, we can go.	Idan dare ne mai kyau, za mu iya tafiya.
But he soon realized he could not.	Amma nan da nan ya gane ba zai iya ba.
Everything will end up on its own in the end.	Komai zai ko da kansa a ƙarshe.
He did not know what to say.	Bai san me zai ce ba.
The sun never sets without looking at this.	Rana ta ba ta cika ba tare da kallon wannan ba.
Not much, of course.	Ba da yawa ba, ba shakka.
I tested it myself.	Na gwada da kaina.
Apply only one.	Sanya daya kawai.
Others are hot.	Wasu kuma suna da zafi.
It looks really good.	Yayi kyau sosai a gaskiya.
People are not her thing.	Mutane ba abin ta ba ne.
People want to help you.	Mutane suna son taimaka muku.
He lives.	Yana rayuwa.
I was devastated.	Na bata wa kaina rai.
I am reading this now.	Ina karanta wannan yanzu.
She feels that something big is going to happen.	Tana jin cewa wani babban abu ne zai faru.
Now, let’s find out the real thing.	Yanzu, bari mu sami ainihin.
I will lose my job.	Zan rasa aiki na.
Use it however you like.	Yi amfani da shi yadda kuke so.
So they went on.	Haka suka kara gaba.
They just don’t work.	Ba sa aiki kawai.
But of course not.	Amma tabbas babu sauran.
When you do a good job, he will tell you.	Lokacin da kuka yi aiki mai kyau, zai gaya muku.
If it is too cold, they will panic.	Idan sanyi ya yi yawa, za su ji tsoro.
Maybe it will be right.	Wataƙila zai yi daidai.
I say to keep going.	Ina fada don ci gaba.
Of course he needs to be careful.	Tabbas yana bukatar ya yi hankali.
Are you with us?	Kuna tare da mu?.
We can't do it.	Ba za mu iya yi ba.
And we do this year after year.	Kuma muna yin wannan shekara bayan shekara.
I can only work with one hand at a time.	Zan iya aiki da hannu ɗaya kawai a lokaci guda.
He is the one.	Shi ne wanda.
He does not pretend to be a child himself.	Ba ya yi kamar shi kansa yaro ne.
He plays very well.	Yana wasa sosai.
She's been seeing a lot of things.	An yi ta ganin abin da dama.
I don't want anyone to be hurt.	Ba na son kowa ya ji rauni.
Let them speak.	Su yi magana.
This is nothing new.	Wannan ba sabon abu ba ne.
I am as surprised as you.	Na yi mamaki kamar ku.
He passed by her.	Ya wuce da ita.
Much can be said about this.	Za a iya cewa da yawa game da wannan.
They know nothing, really.	Ba su san komai ba, da gaske.
Don't be too surprised.	Kar ka yi mamaki sosai.
I join you.	Ina shiga da ku.
It can be bought by anyone.	Ana iya siyan kowa da kowa.
Request denied.	An ƙi buƙatar.
Children go to school.	Yara suna zuwa makaranta.
Travel is difficult.	Tafiya ke da wuya.
I want to pass well.	Ina so in wuce da kyau.
If anyone comes in, call the police.	Idan wani ya shiga, kira 'yan sanda.
He looked at the big man.	Ya kalli babban mutumin.
No one can leave.	Babu wanda zai iya barin.
One must realize that effort is necessary.	Dole ne mutum ya fahimci cewa ƙoƙari ya zama dole.
Whatever you fear, or what you are told.	Duk abin da kuke tsoro, ko abin da aka gaya muku.
It's been a while.	An riga an ɗan jira kaɗan.
Do not get into any trouble.	Kar ku shiga cikin wata matsala.
It works the other way around.	Yana aiki da wata hanya kuma.
Let me fill you up.	Bari in cika ku.
He did not think.	Bai yi tunani ba.
This is an immediate global victory.	Wannan nasara ce ta duniya nan take.
I heard you crying.	Na ji kuka.
Three people were killed.	Mutane uku ne suka mutu.
I did not drink.	Ban sha ba.
But there should be no mistake.	Amma bai kamata a sami kuskure ba.
And now you will find yourself writing things you never thought possible before.	Kuma yanzu za ku sami kanku kuna rubuta abubuwan da ba ku taɓa tunani ba a baya.
You know it now.	Kun san shi yanzu.
Discomfort around women.	Rashin jin dadi a kusa da mata.
Her title did not come to her.	Abin da take bai zo mata ba.
Not before, and not now.	Ba a da ba, kuma ba yanzu ba.
And so it should be.	Kuma haka ya kamata ya kasance.
It is nothing new.	Ba sabon abu ba ne.
They work for us.	Suna yi mana aiki.
Don't worry.	Kar ku damu.
You have left.	Kun bar wurin.
He was not the only one to hear anything.	Ba shi kadai ya ji wani abu ba.
She can get involved.	Tana iya shiga ciki.
I have a plan with you.	Ina da shirin ni da ku.
This story was done until he died.	An yi wannan labarin har ya mutu.
I think that's very good.	Ina tsammanin hakan yana da kyau sosai.
This does not seem to be the case.	Da alama wannan ba haka yake ba.
The problem is you say.	Matsalar ku ce.
It's too early.	Da wuri yayi yawa.
Still, it was very interesting.	Duk da haka, ya kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
Read it every day.	Karanta shi kowace rana.
None here.	Babu ko ɗaya a nan.
Eventually people realized what we were doing.	A ƙarshe mutane sun fahimci abin da muke yi.
I want to tell him that, for me.	Ina so in gaya masa haka, a gare ni.
Or not.	Ko a'a.
It is not good for people to drink.	Bai dace da mutane su sha ba.
I can do this job easily.	Zan iya yin wannan aikin cikin sauƙi.
I can no longer stay here.	Ba zan iya ƙara zama a nan ba.
This is the last one.	Wannan shine na ƙarshe.
There is nothing new about this, of course.	Babu wani sabon abu game da wannan, ba shakka.
More things are coming.	Ƙarin abubuwan suna zuwa.
It's not just my thing.	Ba abu na bane kawai.
It can really work.	Yana iya gaske aiki.
She knew something was up.	Ta san wani abu ya tashi.
And then we cut several times.	Kuma sai mun yanke sau da yawa.
I don't play.	Ba na yin wasan.
Maybe it will be necessary.	Wataƙila zai zama dole.
We do.	Muna yi.
We realize that there is no single, simple answer.	Mun gane cewa babu guda ɗaya, amsa mai sauƙi.
I don’t expect much trouble later, though.	Ba na tsammanin matsala da yawa daga baya, ko da yake.
With this need to pay.	Da wannan bukata ya biya.
He told me the man's name.	Ya gaya mani sunan mutumin.
They started to annoy me.	Sun fara bata min rai.
He was on the ground.	Ya kasance a kasa.
We could not help him.	Ba mu iya taimaka masa ba.
You need to come and get some of this work.	Kuna buƙatar zuwa don samun ɗan wannan aikin.
They knew it was going to be a big wedding.	Sun san zai zama babban bikin aure.
A year ago, it would not have been so.	Shekara daya da ta wuce, da ba haka ta kasance ba.
It hurt like nothing he had ever experienced.	Ya yi zafi kamar babu wani abu da ya taɓa samu.
They do not know what is good and what is bad.	Ba su san abin da ke mai kyau da abin da ba shi da kyau.
You did a great job here.	Kun yi kyakkyawan aiki a nan.
There is still a lot to be gained.	Har yanzu akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a samu.
I am not pregnant now.	Ba ni da ciki yanzu.
I tried them again.	Na sake gwada su.
The program is over.	An gama shirin.
I looked up.	Na kalli sama.
If he did, it worked.	Idan ya yi, ya yi aiki.
She was smart and beautiful.	Ta kasance mai hankali da kyau.
You can not do such a thing.	Ba za ku iya yin irin wannan abu ba.
They are so beautiful.	Sun yi kyau sosai.
They don't need you.	Ba sa bukatar ku.
He must be terrified.	Dole ne ya ji tsoro da gaske.
There was some fear, though.	Akwai wani tsoro, ko da yake.
Had she wanted to do this, once.	Da ta so yin wannan, sau ɗaya.
Only, though.	Sai kawai, ko da yake.
Many people.	Mutane da yawa.
I saw things.	Na ga abubuwa.
She did not say anything about how the incident happened.	Ba ta ce komai ba na yadda abin ya faru.
I am healthy and happy.	Ina lafiya kuma ina farin ciki.
Three children are in school now.	Yara uku suna makaranta yanzu.
It seems to be working now.	Da alama yana aiki yanzu.
Do not go swimming alone!	Kada ku tafi yin iyo kai kaɗai!
No wonder she wants to go to the beach!	Ba mamaki tana son zuwa bakin ruwa!
It doesn't have to be this way, but it does.	Ba haka ya kamata ya kasance ba, amma haka abin yake.
It’s a fun little movie.	Wani ɗan fim ne mai daɗi.
He will never be killed.	Ba za a taba kashe shi ba.
That makes sense.	Cewa ya sa a rai.
To bring us together.	Don kawo mu tare.
But why it is so amazing.	Amma dalilin da ya sa ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
I know that and you know that.	Na san haka kuma kun san hakan.
It is always good to get up early.	Yana da kyau koyaushe a tashi da wuri.
They are very fast.	Suna da sauri sosai.
He agreed.	Ya yarda da shi.
They want you to know how much they love you.	Suna son ku san yadda suke son ku.
I want to know if they are right.	Ina so in san ko sun yi daidai.
What is it wherever he is, he can not say.	Me yake ko a ina yake, ba zai iya cewa ba.
No one.	Babu kowa.
It feels good to be outside.	Yana jin daɗin zama a waje.
But this is not the case.	Amma ba haka yake ba.
She just fixed it.	Sai kawai ta gyara shi.
The view of the water is beautiful.	Kallon ruwan yayi kyau.
He just took it.	Kawai ya dauka shi ne.
There is no better way.	Babu wata hanya da ta fi kyau.
He did it in the past, and made it work.	Ya yi shi a baya, kuma ya sanya shi aiki.
Keep doing the right things.	Ci gaba da yin abubuwan da suka dace.
It’s amazing, great talk.	Yana da ban mamaki, babban magana.
We do not even have to stop.	Ba ma sai mun tsaya ba.
Stay tuned with us !.	Ku kwana tare da mu!.
We must learn to work together.	Dole ne mu koyi aiki tare.
You do not have to look for it.	Ba sai ka nemi shi ba.
But you should go.	Amma ya kamata ku tafi.
It is not a lie.	Ba karya ba ne.
I know we do.	Na san muna yi.
The police know him very well.	'Yan sanda sun san shi sosai.
I have to say no.	Dole ne in ce a'a.
We are not talking about him.	Ba shi muke magana ba.
I didn't get a job because of this.	Ban samu aiki ba saboda wannan.
So this is good.	Don haka wannan yana da kyau.
That's his job.	Aikin sa kenan.
I hope he can't get it.	Ina fatan ba zai iya samu ba.
Why are you here?	Me yasa kuke nan?
You will probably be rejected.	Wataƙila za a ƙi ku.
Readings are about to begin.	Yanzu an kusa fara karatu.
She can walk anytime.	Za ta iya tafiya kowane lokaci.
I was afraid of that.	Na ji tsoron hakan.
Do not take anything for granted.	Kada ku ɗauka komai.
Just stay safe.	Kawai zauna lafiya.
By the time you arrive, you will already be late!	Zuwa lokacin da kuka zo, za ku riga kun makara!
He was great overall.	Ya kasance mai girma gaba ɗaya.
Together they looked at each other.	A tare suka kalli juna.
He is tired.	Ya gaji.
We are not there.	Ba mu can ba.
I'd like to have it around.	Ina son samun shi a kusa.
Pay attention, and do it well!	Mai da hankali, kuma ku yi shi da kyau!
I really enjoyed it.	Na ji daɗi sosai.
You know it.	Kun san shi.
Probably not.	Wataƙila ba shi ba ne.
I'm just sick.	Ina rashin lafiya kawai.
Thus.	Ta haka.
I want to think of talking to them.	Ina so in yi tunanin magana da su.
Whatever she wants.	Duk yadda ta so.
It was a great day.	Rana ce mai girma.
I was as surprised as anyone.	Na yi mamaki kamar kowa.
But he was.	Amma ya kasance.
I hope he changes course.	Ina fatan ya canza hanya.
But two things.	Amma abubuwa biyu.
Here is the work that should work for you.	Ga aikin da yakamata yayi muku aiki.
Not that you will not already.	Ba cewa ba za ku riga.
First they like it.	Na farko da suke son shi.
It's a joke, he told himself.	Wasa ne, ya gaya wa kansa.
It is the last day of the year.	Ita ce ranar ƙarshe ta shekara.
I knew they had arrested me.	Na san sun kama ni.
I was very happy.	Na yi farin ciki sosai.
We can't find a way home.	Ba za mu iya samun hanyar gida ba.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Babu wani abu da ya dace da hakan.
You will not be brought back here.	Ba za a dawo da ku nan ba.
Now the place is gone.	Yanzu wurin ya tafi.
They were for me, maybe not yours.	Sun kasance a gare ni, watakila ba na ku ba ne.
This is a little bit of one thing.	Wannan kadan ne daga cikin abu daya.
He did just that.	Ya yi daidai da haka.
It could be night.	Zai iya zama dare.
Attention kills the dog.	Hankali ya kashe kare.
Maybe even more.	Wataƙila ma fiye da haka.
I'm sure time will pass quickly.	Na tabbata lokaci zai wuce da sauri.
I want to talk about it.	Ina so in fada game da shi.
This worked really well for me.	Wannan yayi min aiki sosai.
He wants us to know him.	Yana so mu san shi.
It's funny though.	Yana da ban dariya ko da yake.
They need to get their money back.	Suna buƙatar dawo da kuɗin su.
It should be appropriate.	Ya kamata ya dace.
But in the end, it doesn't work.	Amma a ƙarshe, ba ya aiki.
We only spent one day together.	Muka kwana daya kawai tare.
We'll see how it goes.	Za mu ga yadda za ta kasance.
I asked her what was the problem?	Na tambaye ta menene matsalar?
They knew when they signed that it could go to that.	Sun san lokacin da suka sanya hannu akan cewa yana iya zuwa ga wannan.
We were afraid we would lose it.	Mun ji tsoron kada mu rasa shi.
There are so many things to play.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa a wasa.
Just enjoy where you are and move on.	Kawai ji daɗin inda kuke kuma ku ci gaba.
Another joined in and added others.	Wani kuma ya shiga ya kara wasu.
We gave our money.	Mun ba da kuɗin mu.
I made myself very well.	Na yi kaina sosai.
I can give this away.	Zan iya ba da wannan tafi.
I’ve been both for many years now.	Na yi duka biyu shekaru da yawa yanzu.
Or call it interest.	Ko kira shi sha'awa.
We are not put.	Ba a saka mu ba.
Kids love it.	Yara suna son shi.
Something.	Da wani abu.
I've been arrested a lot.	An kama ni da yawa.
I was in it.	Na kasance a ciki.
This you will never do.	Wannan ba za ku taba yi ba.
Maybe he is sleeping.	Wataƙila yana barci.
We can’t look for the best seat.	Ba za mu iya neman mafi kyawun zama ba.
Maybe they are right, but they have to wait.	Wataƙila suna da gaskiya, amma dole ne su jira.
No, not much happens.	A'a, ba da yawa ke faruwa.
She is there.	Tana can.
She never left the house with them.	Ko kadan bata bar gidan da su ba.
So it feels good to work for me.	Don haka yana jin daɗin aiki a gare ni.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally.	Jin ba sabon abu bane kuma na ɗan lokaci ne.
He, however, looked.	Ya, duk da haka, ya duba.
Just get them.	Samun su ne kawai.
She was not afraid to fly, she realized.	Ba ta da tsoron tashi, ta gane.
Be careful again, I have how you walk.	Yi hankali kuma, ina da yadda kuke tafiya.
This is true.	Wannan gaskiya ne.
I feel for her.	Ina ji da ita.
I know there is a place.	Na san akwai wani wuri.
I would say you love yourselves.	Zan ce ku so kanku.
She passed him.	Ta wuce shi.
Sign back.	Sa hannu a baya.
He spoke like a schoolboy.	Yayi magana kamar dan makaranta.
No one will ever touch me like that again.	Ba wanda zai sake taba ni haka.
Why, we are so happy together.	Me ya sa, muna farin ciki sosai tare.
She said she just bought this boat.	Ta ce kawai ta sayi wannan jirgin ruwa.
I was there for a while.	Na kasance a can na ɗan lokaci.
What works for some will certainly not work for others.	Abin da ke aiki ga wasu ba shakka ba zai yi aiki ga wasu ba.
The name is everything.	Sunan shine komai.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
To talk about it.	Don yin magana game da shi.
They can talk later.	Za su iya magana daga baya.
Will you check the car thoroughly?	Za ku duba motar sosai?
Something new is needed.	Ana buƙatar wani sabon abu.
He lost his true sense of humor.	Ya rasa gaskiya ji.
Some girls are crying.	Wasu 'yan mata suna kuka.
Home will not be shown.	Ba za a nuna gida ba.
She felt comfortable.	Ta ji dadi.
They can film where and when they want.	Suna iya yin fim a inda kuma lokacin da suke so.
No need to cry.	Babu bukatar kuka.
Should it be good or not?	Yakamata yayi kyau ko?.
I want to know how to make one though.	Ina so in san yadda ake yin daya ko da yake.
All this.	Duk wannan.
She will be here.	Za ta kasance a nan.
But you can do it.	Amma kuna iya yin hakan.
She felt sad alone.	Ta ji bakin ciki ita kadai.
For I remember.	Don na tuna.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu wani abu da ya wuce haka.
I have lived there ever since.	Na zauna a can tun.
We have no people.	Ba mu da mutane.
But for me, it just felt like never coming back.	Amma a gare ni, sai kawai ya ji kamar ba zai dawo ba.
There are many more.	Akwai wasu da yawa.
The celebration of the name was a joy.	Bikin suna ya yi farin ciki.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
I decided to make a call.	Na yanke shawarar yin kira.
I can't help it.	Ba zan iya taimaka masa ba.
It is a very interesting film.	Fim ne mai ban sha'awa sosai.
I was happy about that.	Na yi farin ciki a kan abin.
I'm glad to see they are back.	Ina farin cikin ganin sun dawo.
And yes, a lot.	Kuma haka ne, da yawa.
But you will lose a lot of things.	Amma za ku rasa abubuwa da yawa.
The plane took off.	Jirgin ya tashi sama.
You only work for the landlord.	Kuna aiki ne kawai ga mai gida.
I will see that she is well cared for.	Zan ga an kula da ita sosai.
They killed the second one.	Sun kashe na biyu.
Now, people do not know where to get this.	Yanzu, mutane ba su san inda za su samu wannan ba.
It is not so.	Ba haka ba ne.
Even if you do not.	Ko da ba ka.
I never thought that day would come.	Ban taba tunanin wannan ranar za ta zo ba.
Everything works fine.	Komai yana aiki sosai.
The timing is good.	Lokaci yana da kyau.
Maybe you feel well.	Wataƙila kun ji lafiya.
Let this happen.	Bari wannan ya faru.
I still feel good watching them.	Har yanzu ina jin dadi ina kallon su.
He was asked the way.	Aka tambaye shi hanya.
It has to do with what it is.	Yana da yi da abin da yake.
He never saw anything.	Bai taba ganin komai ba.
She raised her hand to him.	Ta daga masa hannu.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
Someone takes time.	Wani yana ɗaukar lokaci.
People want to look like these.	Mutane suna so su yi kama da waɗannan.
Next up is the material.	Na gaba shine kayan.
She loves her game.	Tana son wasan ta.
The train then returned to the station.	Daga nan jirgin ya koma cikin tashar.
Two to one.	Biyu zuwa daya.
If you want to travel, get out now.	Idan kuna son tafiya, fita yanzu.
You see they are upset.	Ka ga sun damu.
Had she not come to this meeting.	Da ba ta zo wannan taron ba.
Exactly me.	Daidai da ni.
Lots of things like that.	Abubuwa da yawa kamar haka.
Now everyone does.	Yanzu kowa yayi.
Here is what he said.	Ga abin da ya ce.
I miss you, help.	Na rasa, taimako.
They want it to go and you see.	Suna son ya tafi kuma kuna gani.
He did not feel well.	Bai ji dadi ba.
My dog ​​can pick up the ball.	Kare na na iya ɗaukar ƙwallon.
You’re good without it.	Kuna da kyau ba tare da shi ba.
It looks good on her.	Yayi mata kyau.
I know too.	Ni ma na sani.
It was everything to me.	Ya kasance komai a gare ni.
We are moving fast.	Muna tafiya da sauri.
If you can work around them, do it.	Idan za ku iya aiki a kusa da su, yi haka.
The same goes for everyone.	Haka ma kowa.
Others have done so in the past.	Sauran sun yi haka a baya.
They never wanted to see.	Ba su taɓa son gani ba.
That worked out well for her.	Hakan yayi mata kyau.
There is a new movie.	Akwai sabon fim.
I saved it.	na ajiye shi.
For other people, not for me.	Ga sauran mutane, ba don ni ba.
But the rest.	Amma sauran.
I am sorry for what she did.	Ina bakin ciki da abin da ta yi.
One can put this in another way.	Mutum na iya sanya wannan ta wata hanya.
However, no progress has been made since.	Duk da haka, babu wani ci gaba da aka samu tun lokacin.
This is true for every single person.	Wannan gaskiya ne ga kowane mutum guda.
You enter first.	Ka shiga na farko.
He wanted to be.	Ya so ya kasance.
But that never made her rise.	Amma hakan bai taba sa ta tashi ba.
Good luck.	Kyau mai kyau.
No one today finds out that it is so.	Babu wani gano yau cewa haka yake.
And they are smart.	Kuma suna da hankali.
To just let it go.	Don kawai bari ya tafi.
There must be a better way.	Dole ne a sami hanya mafi kyau.
Traveling is difficult.	Tafiya yake da wuya.
But as she says.	Amma yadda ta fada.
It will not happen.	Ba zai faru ba.
This is the best way to start a new business.	Wannan ita ce hanya mafi kyau don fara sabon aiki.
Everyone was surprised.	Kowa yayi mamaki.
If you like, please eat.	Idan kuna so, don Allah ku ci.
He didn't play.	Bai ji wasa ba.
You are trying to feel good about yourself.	Kuna ƙoƙarin jin daɗi game da kanku.
You all love the outdoors.	Ku duka kuna son waje.
Great too.	Babban kuma.
We are not over yet.	Har yanzu ba mu wuce ba.
I don't want you to think so.	Ba na son ku yi tunanin haka.
He spoke, and he must.	Ya yi magana, kuma dole ne.
We can not go on.	Ba za mu iya ci gaba ba.
No one likes it.	Babu wanda yake son shi.
Tashi said.	Tashi yace.
She lit a cigarette and looked at the water.	Ta kunna taba tana kallon ruwan.
The others did not agree with her.	Sauran ba su yarda da ita ba.
Everything must be found.	Dole ne a gano komai.
Man like that.	Mutum kamar haka.
Like she saw something.	Kamar ta ga wani abu.
It's a little weird.	Ya dan yi kadan.
Keep walking because of what else you can do.	Ci gaba da tafiya saboda me kuma za ku iya yi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lokaci yayi da aka gwada shi.
Now, let's see what and what we missed here.	Yanzu, bari mu ga abin da kuma muka rasa a nan.
Not done now, not even by him.	Ba a yi yanzu ba, har ma da shi.
I'm glad no one saw that.	Na ji dadi ba wanda ya ga haka.
I recommend everyone look at it.	Ina ba da shawarar kowa ya kalli shi.
The children are running.	Yara suna gudu.
They boarded the train when it entered the station.	Sun shiga cikin jirgin lokacin da ya shiga tashar.
I will leave this house.	Zan bar gidan nan.
Things are going well.	Abubuwa sun yi kyau sosai.
I will pay everything.	Zan biya komai.
It’s amazing, amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki, ban mamaki.
That's just it.	Wannan kawai.
Maybe that has changed.	Wataƙila hakan ya canza.
I do not want to know much.	Ba na son sani sosai.
There is something fishy about all of this.	Akwai wani abu mai kifi game da wannan duka.
Make sure you look at the time carefully.	Tabbatar kun kalli lokacin a hankali.
You will not succeed.	Ba za ku yi nasara ba.
She would be better off without it.	Ta fi kyau ba tare da shi ba.
No time to cry.	Babu lokacin kuka.
You should check them out.	Ya kamata ku duba su.
We want to get home, we do.	Muna so mu dawo gida, muna yi.
Not by myself.	Ba da kaina ba.

We agree to be accustomed.	Mu yarda mu saba.
Everyone goes ahead.	Kowa yayi gaba.

Get in the car.	Shiga mota.
They are good things.	Abubuwa ne masu kyau.
And he can be himself around her.	Kuma yana iya zama da kansa a kusa da ita.
But she doesn't want to play this game with him.	Amma ba ta son yin wannan wasan da shi.
I did not add anything.	Ban kara cewa komai ba.
That is a fact.	Wannan gaskiya ce.
Give this user a first and last name.	Ba wa wannan mai amfani da sunan farko da na ƙarshe.

I couldn’t do it much.	Na kasa yi da ita da yawa.
If they do, they will stop.	Idan sun yi, za su daina.
But he did not leave us.	Amma bai bar mu ba.
They don’t look like happiness.	Ba su yi kama da farin ciki ba.
The food is amazing.	Abincin yana da ban mamaki.
Not really here, however.	Ba sosai a nan, amma.
There is no arrest.	Babu kama.
But this is one.	Amma wannan daya ne.
And it is not.	Kuma ba shi ba.
So take care of that.	Don haka a kula da wannan.
It is difficult to identify them.	Yana da wuya a gane su.
She knows about these things, little by little.	Ta san game da waɗannan abubuwa, kaɗan kaɗan.
But that is the name of the game.	Amma wannan shine sunan wasan.
It cannot be mistaken in any way.	Ba za a iya kuskure ta kowace hanya ba.
But he doesn't seem to care.	Amma da alama bai damu ba.
A difficult day requires a good dinner.	Ranar wahala tana buƙatar abincin dare mai daɗi.
I still think you added it, whatever you say.	Har yanzu ina tsammanin kun kara da shi, komai za ku ce.
He was right.	Ya yi daidai.
Everything was taken care of.	An kula da komai.
You will never talk about it.	Ba za ku taɓa yin magana game da shi ba.
We are not here.	Ba haka muke ba a nan.
He said the story was false.	Yace labarin karya ne.
There was something else he started doing.	Akwai wani abu kuma da ya fara yi.
But you must know.	Amma dole ne ku sani.
The truth is good.	Gaskiya yana da kyau.
This can be surprising.	Wannan na iya zama abin ban mamaki.
And we should.	Kuma ya kamata mu.
But maybe this is a mistake.	Amma watakila wannan kuskure ne.
When he came to check on me.	Lokacin da ya zo duba ni.
He has no dog.	Ba shi da kare.
And no more sense.	Kuma babu sauran hankali.
Nice to work with you.	An yi farin ciki yin aiki tare da ku.
At best they must be repaired.	A mafi kyau dole ne a gyara su.
He seemed ready to fight.	Kamar ya shirya fada.
She has nowhere to go.	Ba ta da inda za ta.
They did not add to it.	Ba su kara da shi.
But there is no answer.	Amma ga shi babu amsa.
Just go to work.	Kawai tafi aiki.
She wants to go out.	Tana so ta fita.
You know how this happens and why.	Kun san yadda wannan ke faruwa kuma me yasa.

Some are fighting, some are sleeping.	Wasu suna fada, wasu suna barci.
This is something that will be worked on in the future.	Wannan wani abu ne da za a yi aiki a kansa nan gaba.
You played a good game.	Kun yi wasa mai kyau.
He’s an interesting guy for sure.	Mutum ne mai ban sha'awa tabbas.
Don't worry about the dog.	Kar ka damu da kare.

I have never tried it.	Ban taba gwada shi ba.
We show it to everyone.	Mun nuna shi ga kowa da kowa.
I will never play with you again.	Ba zan ƙara yi muku wasa ba.
She ate well.	Ta ci sosai.
Others have nothing and no one.	Wasu kuma ba su da komai kuma babu kowa.
I can feel people inside.	Ina iya jin mutane a ciki.
Nothing for him.	Babu wani abu a gare shi.
I see they are hurt more than that and they are still going strong.	Na ga sun ji rauni fiye da wannan kuma har yanzu suna ci gaba.
I'm just surprised.	Ina mamaki kawai.
If something happens, it happens.	Idan wani abu ya faru, yana faruwa.
Just look at it yourself, and see what happens.	Kawai kalli shi da kanku, ku ga abin da ya faru.
She could not reach the house.	Ba za ta iya isa gidan ba.
They are growing.	Suna kara girma.
I was so scared.	Na ji tsoro sosai.
It will be more interesting now than it was then.	Zai fi ban sha'awa yanzu fiye da yadda yake a lokacin.
It will not open.	Ba zai bude ba.
Seriously, think about it.	Da gaske, yi tunani game da shi.
Maybe that's what he will do for you.	Wataƙila abin da zai yi muku ma ke nan.
So she may stay at home for a while.	Don haka tana iya zama a gida na ɗan lokaci.
She has no back, no front.	Ba ta da baya, ba ta gaba.
I like that.	Ina son hakan.
Stay home.	Ku zauna a gida.
But that is still not the case.	Amma har yanzu ba haka yake ba.
How often do you come here?	Sau da yawa zo nan?
However, many people continue to do so.	Duk da haka, mutane da yawa suna ci gaba da yin hakan.
You want to hurry or whatever.	Kuna son yin sauri ko menene.
If he knows what to do, he tells us.	Idan ya san abin da zai yi, sai ya gaya mana.
Save to cool slightly.	Ajiye don yin sanyi kaɗan.
They are almost identical.	Su kusan daidai suke.
You always know where he is.	Kullum kuna san inda yake.
I'm very tired now.	Na gaji da yawa a yanzu.
They all ran away.	Duk sun gudu.

Think about getting a handicraft.	Yi tunani game da samun aikin hannu.
This has happened a lot.	Wannan ya faru da yawa.
There is no doubt.	Babu sauran shakka.
And the intelligent recognize it and what it is.	Kuma masu hankali sun gane shi da abin da yake.
Just look at us.	Kallon mu kawai.

Second, it never happened.	Na biyu, bai taba faruwa ba.
He should just go now.	Ya kamata kawai ya tafi yanzu.

We will add fish to the water.	Za mu ƙara kifi a cikin ruwa.

Now everything should work as it should.	Yanzu duk ya kamata a yi aiki kamar yadda ya kamata.
Not just for me, but for everyone.	Ba don ni kaɗai ba, amma ga kowa.

He was so amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki sosai.

She will continue to do good things for you.	Za ta ci gaba da yi muku abubuwa masu kyau.
But it all happened.	Amma duka sun faru.

This can be explained as follows.	Ana iya bayyana wannan kamar haka.

People smoked in the restaurant.	Mutane sun sha taba a cikin gidan abincin.
Let me love her.	Bari in so ta.

All of the same.	Duk na daya.
Most enjoyable, how.	Mafi jin daɗi, ta yaya.
They will not bring her to this meeting.	Ba za su kawo ta wannan taron ba.
Often like they don’t get it.	Sau da yawa kamar ba su samu ba.
I did this myself.	Na yi wannan da kaina.
I would love to hear all about it.	Da na so jin duka game da shi.
One thing is for sure.	Abu daya cewa.

This is a good thing.	Wannan abu ne mai kyau.
She loves it, but she does not show it easily.	Tana son shi, amma ba ta nuna mata cikin sauƙi.
But no one answered.	Amma babu wanda ya amsa.
The man worked.	Mutumin ya yi aiki.
Two years later, he did the same thing again.	Bayan shekaru biyu, ya sake yin irin wannan abu.
Great, we thought.	Mai girma, mun yi tunani.
It’s harder than people think, you know.	Yana da wahala fiye da yadda mutane ke tunani, ka sani.
It's very sad.	Yana da matukar bakin ciki.
Not once did they make me wait.	Ba sau ɗaya suka sa ni jira ba.
They killed him!	Sun kashe shi!
No because it was never accepted.	A'a saboda saboda ba a taɓa yarda da shi ba.
Let me show you this.	Bari in nuna muku wannan.
We don't have that here.	Ba mu da wannan a nan.
He was my world.	Ya kasance duniya ta.
When finished, the room remained that way.	Da aka gama, dakin ya kasance haka.
But he left it too late.	Amma ya bar shi a makara.
You can even hear it.	Kuna iya ma jin shi.
It does almost exactly that.	Yana yin kusan daidai wannan.
This is correct.	Wannan daidai ne.

No answer.	Babu amsa.
You do not have to pay anything.	Ba sai ka biya komai ba.
But, you will succeed if you keep trying your best.	Amma, za ku yi nasara idan kun ci gaba da ƙoƙari mafi kyau.
You should see things like that.	Ya kamata ku ga abubuwan da ya kama.
He would not have thought so.	Da bai yi tunanin haka ba.
They arrive by work day and night.	Suna kai ta wurin aiki dare da rana.
When does the train leave?	Yaushe jirgin kasa zai tashi?
This, of course, is not true.	Wannan, ba shakka, ba gaskiya ba ne.
But he will return.	Amma zai dawo.
She was crying.	Ta kasance tana kuka.

A thought came to me.	Wani tunani ya zo min.
The answer is good too.	Amsa yana da kyau kuma.
Come and kill him.	Ku zo ku kashe shi.

He has them.	Ya na da su.
Just stop, stop, stop.	Kawai tsaya, tsaya, tsaya.

I love you for it.	Ina son ku don shi.

You can't blame yourself.	Ba za ku iya zargin kanku ba.

However, we are still here.	Duk da haka, muna nan har yanzu.
What will happen to them is uncertain.	Abin da zai faru da su ba shi da tabbas.
But he is a smart boy.	Amma shi yaro ne mai hankali.

But overall speaking, it is not very good for people.	Amma gaba ɗaya magana, ba ta da kyau sosai ga mutane.
I can't leave here.	Ba zan iya barin nan ba.
We are looking at the world.	Muna kallon duniya.
You need to go and not come back.	Kuna buƙatar tafiya kuma kada ku dawo.
She couldn’t take that, every day.	Ba ta iya ɗaukar wannan, kowace rana.

Give me one.	Bani daya.
Go and buy today, everyone.	Ku je ku saya yau, kowa da kowa.
Not for myself, not for anyone.	Ba don kaina ba, ba ga kowa ba.
None of it worked.	Babu ko ɗaya daga ciki ya yi aiki.

You don't give her anything.	Baka mata komai.
It will no longer be a problem.	Ba zai ƙara zama matsala ba.
Already such a thing costs money!	Riga irin wannan yana kashe kuɗi!
He is on the run.	Yana kan gudu.
Water is a matter of life and death.	Ruwa abu ne na rayuwa.
The restaurant offers local food.	Gidan cin abinci ya ba da abincin gida.

Of course it is a lie.	Tabbas karya ce.

The reason for this is not hard to find.	Dalilin haka ba shi da wuya a samu.
She says both are fun and irrational.	Ta ce duka na sha'awa ne da kuma rashin hankali.
He would not take any chances.	Ba zai yi wani dama ba.

Don't say that.	Kada ya ce haka.
That's why exactly.	Shi ya sa daidai.
I failed them.	Na kasa su.
Now tell me.	Yanzu gaya mani.
That would not be the first time.	Da ba shine karo na farko ba.
I am looking for the truth.	Ina neman gaskiya.
Dan, something must be done immediately.	Dan, dole ne a yi wani abu nan da nan.
She has no one.	Ba ta da kowa.
That is a good statement.	Wannan magana ce mai kyau.
Interesting things.	Abubuwa masu ban sha'awa.
After all, it worked well.	Bayan haka, ya yi aiki da kyau.
Now, come with me.	Yanzu, zo tare da ni.
I remember how we were.	Na tuna yadda muka kasance.
I want you to defend what you are doing.	Ina so ku kare abin da kuke yi.
He decided to go.	Ya yanke shawarar tafiya.
Just look at what you drink.	Kalli abin da kuke sha kawai.
And they hated him.	Kuma sun ƙi shi.
I never told anyone.	Ban taba gaya wa kowa ba.
He came.	Ya zo.
She stopped at the bus stop.	Ta tsaya a tashar mota.
He never said that.	Bai taba yin magana haka ba.
He hit her again.	Ya sake buga mata.
When the man finished speaking, no one answered.	Da mutumin ya gama magana, babu wanda ya amsa.
But life is safe.	Amma rayuwa tana nan lafiya.
I have a big job today.	Ina da babban aiki a yau.
Maybe others would like this kind of material.	Wataƙila wasu za su so irin wannan kayan.
But we missed the opportunity.	Amma mun rasa damar.
We are looking for a server.	Muna neman saba.
Yet they did not stop there.	Amma duk da haka ba su tsaya nan ba.
Interest in the future.	Sha'awar nan gaba.
He and I.	Shi da ni.
Maybe later, not tonight, but tomorrow.	Wataƙila daga baya, ba daren yau ba, amma gobe.
Of course he should not be here, he is doing this.	Tabbas bai kamata ya kasance a nan ba, yana yin wannan.
I opened it.	Na bude shi.
He said and stopped.	Ya fad'a ya tsaya.
Now they are in our big time.	Yanzu suna cikin mu babban lokaci.
Working on a major project that uses this right now.	Yin aiki akan babban aikin da ke amfani da wannan a yanzu.
So no one left.	Don haka babu wanda ya bari.
Fortunately, no one was hurt.	Abin farin ciki, babu wanda ya ji rauni.
As you do.	Kamar yadda kuke yi.
I cried	Na yi kuka
Otherwise they are asleep, or just sitting.	In ba haka ba suna barci, ko kuma kawai a zaune.
I have to work with it.	Dole ne in yi aiki da shi.
What you have but you do not have.	Abin da kuke da shi amma ba ku da shi.
He was above it.	Ya kasance a sama da shi.
And it's scary.	Kuma yana da ban tsoro.
This is not a bad trip.	Wannan ba mummunan tafiya ba ne.
It goes without saying.	Ba sai an fada ba.
You will give them this dress.	Za ku ba su wannan rigar.
The reason is simple.	Dalilin yana da sauƙi.
Another with him.	Wani kuma tare da shi.
Many are now.	Mutane da yawa suna a yanzu.
This is the first time I have tried such a thing.	Wannan shi ne karo na farko da na gwada irin wannan.
He was very close.	Ya kasance kusa sosai.
They are tired of traveling so long.	Sun gaji da tafiya tsawon haka.
It will come soon.	Zata zo da wuri.
This helps me a lot.	Wannan yana taimaka mani sosai.
Leave food available.	Bar abinci akwai.
It may not be more than it looks.	Yana iya zama bai wuce yadda ake gani ba.
That's her favorite.	Abin da ta fi so kenan.
You have to keep your focus.	Dole ne ku ci gaba da mai da hankali.
I'll put it here.	Zan saka a nan.
I’ve never been to one.	Ban taba zuwa daya ba.
No one will fix it.	Babu wanda zai gyara shi.
If she had known this, she would probably have changed what she said.	Da ta san haka, da alama ta canza abin da ta ce.
I would have done anything for her.	Da na yi mata komai.
There is no more of this.	Babu sauran wannan.
So we are happy.	Don haka muna jin daɗi.
He fixed them in place.	Ya gyara su a wuri.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
He thinks to stay.	Yana tunanin ya zauna.
Grow up or die.	Girma ko mutu.
So let's stay in the morning.	Don haka mu zauna da safe.
It makes no ,.	Yana sa babu,.
The one she got.	Wanda ta samu.
She got up.	Ta tashi.
She did so without saying a word.	A haka ta d'auka ba tare da ta ce komai ba.
You do not have to go to school.	Ba sai ka je makaranta ba.
It is difficult to see how they will make so much money.	Yana da wuya a ga yadda za su sami kuɗi da yawa.
He said go.	Ya ce ka tafi.
I heard it.	Na ji shi.
It turned out to be a big lie.	Ya zama babban karya.
Things are amazing.	Abubuwa suna da ban mamaki.
I did not arrest you.	Ba na kama ku ba.
He came from another world.	Ya zo daga wata duniya.
Today is a day of joy and happiness for us.	Yau rana ce ta farin ciki da farin ciki a gare mu.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
The new project is making great progress.	Sabon aikin yana samun ci gaba sosai.
And it happened.	Kuma hakan ya faru.
I think they are very funny.	Ina tsammanin suna da ban dariya sosai.
She is a caretaker.	Ita ce mai kula.
His look did not change.	Kallon sa bai canza ba.
It was a game you both played.	Wasan ne ku biyu kuka buga.
I can go out.	Zan iya fita.
Even put that on so they can see.	Ko da sanya hakan don su iya gani.
This is not the real time.	Wannan ba a ainihin lokacin ba.
He used to see the best in people.	Ya kasance yana ganin mafi kyau a cikin mutane.
Go ahead, try it out.	Ci gaba, gwada shi.
I do not know how it happened.	Ban san yadda abin ya faru ba.
Good to find out his name.	Yayi kyau don gano sunan sa.
I do not know what to say to you.	Ban san abin da zan gaya muku ba.
Then there are the other two.	Bayan akwai wasu biyu.
He once wanted to do good in the world.	Ya taɓa son yin abubuwa masu kyau a duniya.
Don’t rush, don’t worry.	Ba da sauri ba, kada ku damu.
Say he came out.	Ka ce ya fito.
I want them to continue.	Ina so su ci gaba.
Maybe two or three weeks of work.	Wataƙila aikin mako biyu ko uku.
All at the same time.	Duk a lokaci guda.
She really wanted that.	Ta so haka sosai.
We continued to drink, in the afternoon.	Muka ci gaba da sha, da rana.
Everyone laughed at us.	Kowa yayi mana dariya.
Come on in, take a look and enjoy yourself!	Shiga ciki ku sami sabon abu.
And that is not going to happen.	Kuma hakan ba zai faru ba.
Not making a cut.	Ba yin yanke ba.
She has already tried it twice.	Ta riga ta gwada sau biyu.
Here, he felt, that the real problem was.	A nan, ya ji, cewa ainihin matsalar ta kasance.
It's not a game.	Ba wasa ba.
He would never tell her how hurt he was.	Ba zai taba gaya mata yadda ya ji rauni ba.
That's the end of the story.	Karshen labarin kenan.
But that is enough to start things off.	Amma wannan ya isa ya fara abubuwa.
No one knows where you are.	Babu wanda ya san inda kuke.
You will hear about the past, present, and future.	Za ku ji abubuwan da suka gabata, na yanzu, da na gaba.
We know better.	Mun fi sani.
He does not want to go without it.	Baya so ya tafi ba tare da shi ba.
And to love and to love.	Kuma a so kuma a so.
You see it is true.	Ka ga gaskiya ne.
But they saw.	Amma sun gani.
They were among other things.	Sun kasance cikin wasu abubuwa.
I have a house	Ina da gida
I know he will come.	Na san zai zo.
I want to do a lot of things.	Ina so in yi abubuwa da yawa.
A hard cold comes quickly.	Wani sanyi mai wuya yana zuwa da sauri.
But in an inappropriate way.	Amma ta hanyar da ba ta dace ba.
I was there.	Ina wurin.
You are the last.	Ka na ƙarshe.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
He couldn't believe he didn't understand her.	Ya kasa yarda bai gane ta ba.
We are married.	Muna aure.
But still he did not feel right.	Amma duk da haka bai ji daidai ba.
He too did not sleep.	Shi ma bai yi barci ba.
The amount of growth around it makes sense.	Yawan girma a kusa da nan yana da hankali.
They can do whatever they want.	Za su iya yin duk abin da suka ga dama.
As it were.	Kamar yadda ta kasance.
He will have something to tell others.	Zai sami abin da zai gaya wa sauran.
So it's good.	Don haka yana da kyau.
He explained himself to her.	Ya bayyana mata kansa.
Or the past.	Ko kuma abin da ya gabata.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
I have never known such heat.	Ban taba sanin zafi irin wannan ba.
He too did not do well.	Shi ma bai yi kyau ba.
Not worked for two years.	Ba a yi aiki tsawon shekaru biyu ba.
So no problem.	Don haka ba matsala.
I stay home to watch the rain.	Ina zama a gida in duba ruwan sama.
I will print one.	Zan buga guda daya.
Nothing that has been before.	Ba abin da ya kasance a da.
What are they in?	Me suke ciki?
Of course I made a mistake somewhere.	Tabbas na yi kuskure a wani wuri.
I do not like it.	Ba na son shi.
They can tell you.	Za su iya gaya muku.
He is sick.	Ba shi da lafiya.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
They love it.	Suna son shi.
Let's Play.	Mu yi wasa.
We will see through.	Za mu gani ta hanyar.
It was a pleasure to eat.	Abin farin ciki ne don cin abinci.
He helped to take us where we were.	Ya taimaka ya kai mu inda muke.
Take a closer look.	A duba a hankali.
You are everything to them.	Kai ne komai a gare su.
I can take care of myself.	Zan iya kula da kaina.
He went and died.	Ya tafi ya mutu.
Maybe just about how you travel.	Wataƙila kawai game da yadda kuke tafiya.
Laugh.	Yi dariya.
That's what I want.	Abin da nake so kenan.
Let’s take a look at your tools.	Bari mu kalli kayan aikin ku.
Now he wants to film.	Yanzu yana son yin fim.
Hope you enjoyed !!.	Da fatan kun ji daɗi!!.
Admittedly, that may be a good thing.	Gaskiya, hakan na iya zama abu mai kyau.
And you can tell me what happened.	Kuma za ku iya gaya mani abin da ya faru.
We wish we had time.	Da ma mun samu lokaci.
I hope not.	Ina fatan ba haka ba.
We lost our first child a month later.	Mun rasa yaro na farko bayan wata guda.
Please help me on this.	Don Allah a taimake ni akan wannan.
But if you have to go, you have to.	Amma idan dole ne ku tafi, dole ne ku.
It will not hurt.	Ba zai yi zafi ba.
Water is wrong.	Bata da ruwa ba daidai ba ne.
Do not walk.	Kada ku yi tafiya.
Or from you.	Ko daga gare ku.
So little is required for this, it should be for him.	Don haka kadan ake bukata don wannan, ya zama a gare shi.
She was never one.	Ta taba zama daya.
Only, he could not reach himself for.	Kawai, ya kasa kai kansa ga.
That made me feel really good.	Hakan ya sa ni ji sosai.
There is so much to say.	Akwai da yawa don faɗa.
Maybe that will happen this year.	Wataƙila hakan zai faru a wannan shekara.
Let's eat tonight.	Mu ci a daren nan.
He knew it was a sign.	Ya san alama ce.
He opened the door.	Ya bude kofar gidan.
This is all we can do.	Wannan shi ne duk abin da za mu iya yi.
Himself too.	Shi kansa kuma.
But, we did.	Amma, mun yi.
Some do it faster than others.	Wasu suna yin shi da sauri fiye da wasu.
She was told.	Sai da aka gaya mata.
That was the only feeling I had.	Wannan shine kawai ji na.
More than anything.	Fiye da dama fiye da komai.
Let me think.	Bari in yi tunani.
Sometimes it does.	Wani lokaci ya yi.
It does not seem right.	Da alama bai yi daidai ba.
Even if you run now.	Ko da kuna gudu a yanzu.
I do not want to pass the time, as you call it.	Ba na son wuce lokaci, kamar yadda kuke kira shi.
So we do.	Don haka muna yi.
He has to stop.	Dole ya tsaya.
It is hard to believe that it was a week ago.	Yana da wuya a yarda cewa mako guda ne da ya wuce.
Which made me ask myself.	Wanda ya sanya na tambayi kaina.
She just had my night.	Kawai ta yi dare na.
It is finished.	An gama da.
We must be very careful with the money.	Dole ne mu yi hankali sosai da kuɗin.
He is coming here now.	Yana zuwa nan a yanzu.
No more, there is more than one.	Babu sauran, akwai fiye da ɗaya.
Something she would miss.	Wani abin da zata rasa.
More than yourself.	Fiye da kanku.
I need her to know that.	Ina bukatar ta ta san hakan.
Right from it.	Dama daga shi.
He was a name-calling.	Ya kasance mai nuna wata suna.
This feels really good.	Wannan yana jin dadi sosai.
I will just add this.	Zan ƙara wannan kawai.
She did not see.	Ba ta gani ba.
I did well for everyone.	Na yi kyau ga kowane mutum.
The thought of doing it later does not really work.	Tunanin yin shi daga baya baya aiki da gaske.
I wonder why.	Ina mamakin dalilin hakan.
I want to talk about them.	Ina so in yi magana game da su.
I do not know what to say.	Ban san me kuma zan ce ba.
If he had, he would have done so in the first place.	Idan ya kasance, da ya yi haka tun da farko.
For many things.	Na abubuwa da yawa.
Who will win this year?	Wa zai yi nasara a bana?
It can be anything.	Yana iya zama komai.
I am also trying to do my thing.	Ni ma ina ƙoƙarin yin abu na ne.
This is playing.	Wannan yana yin wasa.
It would have been me.	Da ma ni ne.
That is a fact.	Wannan haka gaskiya ne.
You will work on your own.	Za ku yi aiki da kansa.
Be careful.	Za a yi hankali.
He called me to make sure it was working.	Ya kira ni don ya tabbatar da cewa yana aiki.
Please everyone help me.	Don Allah kowa ya taimake ni.
After that, get into this new place.	Bayan haka, shiga cikin wannan sabon wurin.
It's further.	Yana da kara kuma.
And that she had nothing to offer me.	Kuma cewa ba ta da abin da za ta ba ni.
He is not in a hurry.	Ba ya sauri.
God, so sad.	Allah, sai bakin ciki.
I got a job	Na samu aiki
It came to him not to be alone.	Ya zo gare shi kada ya kasance shi kaɗai.
You can not walk.	Ba za ku iya tafiya ba.
But getting there was not easy.	Amma tafiya zuwa wurin ba ta kasance mai sauƙi ba.
This is one thing.	Wannan abu daya ne.
Kind of worked it out in the end.	Irin ya yi aiki da shi a ƙarshe.
Insomnia is common today.	Rashin barci ya zama ruwan dare a yau.
They like to play.	Suna son wasa.
But we are here for a while.	Amma muna nan na ɗan lokaci.
And they will not know.	Kuma ba za su sani ba.
You get to do what you want.	Kuna samun yin abin da kuke so.
Thinking of things.	Tunanin abubuwa.
But both, no.	Amma duka, a'a.
But nothing.	Amma ba komai.
She is married and has children.	Ta yi aure, tana da yara.
They say it is not good.	Sun ce ba shi da kyau.
The train cannot run on water.	Jirgin kasa ba zai iya gudu akan ruwa ba.
It's fighting.	Yin fada ne.
He'll come back and check it out, anyway.	Zai dawo ya duba ta, ko ta yaya.
Show, stand out !.	Nuna, tsaya waje!.
I went to school here.	Na je makaranta a nan.
Not out yet !.	Ba waje tukuna!.
And you're alone.	Kuma ke kadai.
I can only admit that she cried.	Zan iya yarda cewa ta yi kuka.
However, it happens anyway.	Duk da haka, yana faruwa ta wata hanya.
She will pay.	Za ta biya.
Throughout.	Duk lokacin.
One way or another, the person needs to go.	Wata hanya ko wata, mutumin yana bukatar ya tafi.
I want to play, but no one is around	Ina so in yi wasa, amma babu wani a kusa
Everything is on play.	Komai na kan wasa.
I do not need to know that.	Ba na bukatar sanin hakan.
It should not be.	Bai kamata ba.
The place has never been found.	Ba a taɓa samun wurin ba.
We do hot stuff.	Muna yin abubuwa masu zafi.
But you have to put in the work.	Amma dole ne ku sanya aiki.
There is excitement to be had.	Akwai jin daɗi da za a yi.
He is sure to succeed.	Ya tabbata zai yi nasara.
They would have known that this is not the time for now.	Da sun san ba wannan ba na ɗan lokaci yanzu.
As you can see.	Kamar yadda kuke gani.
The train is moving fast.	Jirgin yana tafiya da sauri.
This works fine.	Wannan yana aiki lafiya.
Do not drink too much!	Kar a sha da yawa!
He knew he was good.	Ya san ya yi kyau.
I see things that will never happen.	Ina ganin abubuwan da ba za su taba zama ba.
You need to look at yourself.	Kuna buƙatar kallon kanku.
I do not have to.	Ba sai na yi ba.
He says he is tired of making money.	Yace ya gaji da samun kudi.
He sat down and sat down.	Ya zauna ya zauna.
Get ready.	Ka shirya.
So it seems here it is left out.	Don haka da alama a nan aka bar shi.
He did not even die.	Bai ma mutu ba.
That's what they do.	Abin da suke yi ke nan.
Women do.	Mata suna yin.
They are like oil and water.	Sun kasance kamar mai da ruwa.
The support of the event was amazing here too.	Taimakon taron ya kasance mai ban mamaki a nan kuma.
I don't think it will ever happen.	Ba na jin zai taba faruwa.
So are the rest of us.	Haka sauran mu ma.
It should be a good thing to get a job for a living.	Ya kamata ya zama abu mai kyau don samun aiki na rayuwa.
We are here.	Muna nan.
Equally functional in general.	Daidai da aiki a gaba ɗaya.
I like what happened at home.	Ina son abin ya faru a gida.
However there is nothing there.	Duk da haka babu komai a wurin.
And he reads.	Kuma yana karatu.
My train is about to leave.	Jirgin kasa na yana shirin tafiya.
No, not again.	A'a, ba sake ba.
Now, no problem.	Yanzu, ba matsala.
We need to come here often.	Muna buƙatar zuwa nan sau da yawa.
Just see, this is you.	Kawai gani, wannan shine ku.
As it is now must wait until the weekend.	Kamar yadda yake a yanzu dole ne a jira har zuwa karshen mako.
He will want you all for himself.	Zai so ku duka ga kansa.
This is true.	Wannan gaskiya ne.
I was caught in the cold.	An kama ni cikin sanyi.
It was a great success.	Ya zama babban nasara.
Write it correctly on the original.	Rubuta daidai a kan ainihin.
I don't think that will happen for a while.	Ba na jin hakan zai faru na wani lokaci.
That's what you said.	Abin da kuka ce kenan.
I didn't want him to stop.	Ban so ya tsaya ba.
So much for this method.	Don haka sosai don wannan hanyar.
It has to be done right.	Dole ne a yi daidai.
I don't know exactly how to do it.	Ban san ainihin yadda zan yi ba.
Break some or break them.	Karya wasu ko karya da su.
This is the best decision we have ever made.	Wannan ita ce mafi kyawun shawarar da muka samu.
We didn’t play them, but we saw them playing.	Ba mu buga su ba, amma mun ga suna wasa.
I'm not too worried.	Ban damu sosai ba.
Remember that there is no single answer.	Ka tuna cewa babu amsa ɗaya.
Including us who prepared.	Har da mu da muka shirya.
Done.	An yi.
I walk before he answers.	Ina tafiya kafin ya amsa.
Something we are used to.	Wani abu da muka saba da shi.
We laughed.	Dariya muka yi.
Your time is better off somewhere.	Lokacin ku ya fi kyau a kashe wani wuri.
How much is the first.	Nawa ne na farko.
Let us be who we are.	Bari mu zama wanda muke.
He arrived home.	Ya isa gida.
Remove weekend.	Cire karshen mako.
I expected a lot.	Na yi tsammanin da yawa.
Volunteer seeker	Mai neman damar sa kai
And that's not all.	Kuma ba wannan kadai ba.
I think it is for me.	Ina tsammanin shi ne a gare ni.
Or we know a lot of things are going to happen.	Ko mun san abubuwa da yawa da za su faru.
Nothing on them.	Babu komai akan su.
I know some like them.	Na san wasu suna son su.
Something funny happened.	Wani abin ban dariya ya faru.
Check it out if you like.	Duba shi idan kuna so.
I couldn't get out of there quickly.	Na kasa fita daga wurin da sauri.
With volunteers.	Da ‘yan sa kai.
You're late.	Kun makara.
And want to know why.	Kuma son sanin dalilin.
You do not see.	Ba ka gani.
So do not waste time.	Don haka kada ku bata lokaci.
I missed him.	na rasa shi.
Since then we have done nothing.	Tun daga lokacin ba mu yi komai ba.
It would be nice if others could see it too.	Zai yi kyau idan wasu ma za su iya gani.
To feel like he has succeeded.	Don jin kamar ya yi nasara.
I want you to know that.	Na so, kun san hakan.
They have to do everything for him.	Dole ne su yi masa komai.
I haven't taken one yet.	Ban dauki ko daya ba tun.
Come on in.	Koma menene.
This has happened many times.	Wannan ya faru sau da yawa.
I walk to make sure they get water and food.	Ina tafiya don tabbatar da cewa sun sami ruwa da abinci.
So far, it is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ya zuwa wannan lokaci, har yanzu ba a san ko hakan ya kasance ba.
I think this is funny.	Ina tsammanin wannan abin ban dariya ne.
You can not do that.	Ba za ku iya yin hakan ba.
They will lose a good life.	Za su rasa samun rayuwa mai kyau.
Gradually he rose.	A hankali ya tashi.
But the house is empty.	Amma gidan babu kowa.
The water filled the room.	Ruwa ya cika dakin.
They asked me to write someone else but they did not use it.	Sun ce in rubuta wani amma ba su yi amfani da shi ba.
She must have given you this dress.	Dole ne ta ba ku wannan rigar.
Everything happens so fast.	Komai yana faruwa da sauri.
We stopped.	Mun daina.
He did not think so.	Bai yi tunanin haka ba.
I think it will be very enjoyable.	Ina tsammanin zai ji daɗi sosai.
Whatever you want.	Ko me kuke so.
And he wept.	Sai ya yi kuka.
Only things happened.	Abubuwa ne kawai suka faru.
She had never seen him before.	Ta taba gani kafin ya gani.
I know, though, that this may not be right.	Na san, ko da yake, wannan ba zai iya zama dama ba.
It seems we got out right when we needed to.	Da alama mun fita daidai lokacin da muke bukata.
But don't worry.	Amma kada ku damu.
For years he did not do so.	Ya yi shekaru bai yi haka ba.
But it was too late.	Amma ya makara don haka.
Sometimes nothing is right.	Wani lokaci babu abin da ya dace.
Everything is wrong here.	Komai yayi kuskure a nan.
But to no avail.	Amma babu amfani.
However, they did not know what to do.	Ko ta yaya, sun ɗan rasa abin da za su yi.
He never did.	Ya taba yi.
I wonder what will happen ?.	Ina mamakin me zai faru?.
He used to wait every night for a month, but it never came.	Ya kasance yana jira kowane dare har tsawon wata guda, amma ba ta zo ba.
It is completely new.	Wani sabon abu ne gaba daya.
If we had known, we would have spoken at that time.	Da mun sani, da mun yi magana a lokacin.
People were very happy with him.	Mutane sun yi matukar farin ciki da shi.
After the meeting he left again.	Bayan an gama taron ya sake tashi.
I was really turned on.	An kunna ni sosai.
This car lane needs to be repaired.	Wannan hanyar mota tana buƙatar gyara.
She knew he was there without her looking.	Ta san yana nan ba tare da ta duba ba.
I tell you where he lives.	Ina gaya muku inda yake zaune.
Now it happened again.	Yanzu abin ya sake faruwa da shi.
She is almost out of sight now.	Ta kusa fita daga gani yanzu.
Something wonderful happened.	Wani abu mai ban mamaki ya faru.
No, that is not true.	A'a, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
I don't really want to talk to him.	Ba na son magana da shi sosai.
This is funny, and funny.	Wannan abu ne mai ban dariya, kuma abin ban dariya.
Everyone here does.	Kowa a nan yana yi.
But you have to prepare yourself for it.	Amma dole ne ku shirya kanku don shi.
And nothing has changed.	Kuma babu abin da ya canza.
There is only one chance.	Akwai wata dama guda daya kawai.
Get up before they do.	Tashi kafin su yi.
Come and find some.	Ku zo ku sami wasu.
Nothing, really.	Babu komai, da gaske.
Which made him wonder if they knew.	Wanda hakan ya sa shi tunanin ko sun sani.
Then the fight returned.	Daga nan kuma fada ya koma.
She doesn't look at anything.	Bata kallon komai.
What an exciting world it is!	Abin da duniya mai ban sha'awa ita ce!
Do not try this at home.	Kar a gwada wannan a gida.
We want to end this.	Muna son kawo karshen wannan.
The place is empty, as he expected.	Wurin babu kowa, kamar yadda ya zata.
They do not look like humans.	Ba su yi kama da mutane ba.
Look out!	Yi hankali!
She looked at the closed door.	Ta kalli kofar a rufe.
They want something to pass.	Sun so wani abu ya wuce.
I decided to give it a go.	Na yanke shawarar ba da ita.
Hope you have a better life.	Da fatan za a yi rayuwa mai kyau.
The first is to move forward.	Na farko shi ne don ci gaba.
She had no idea what had happened.	Ba ta san me ya faru ba.
We love it so much.	Muna son shi sosai.
Hope you like it !.	Da fatan kuna son shi!.
Komai.	Komai.
But I did not get it.	Amma ban samu ba.
First, the developmental period was slow.	Na farko, lokacin ci gaba ya kasance a hankali.
They thought he was going to die.	Sun yi tsammanin zai mutu sosai.
No need to hear.	Ba a buƙatar ji.
He doesn't like driving.	Ba ya son tuƙi.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
We are here now.	Yanzu muna nan.
There is no shortage of success in the workplace.	Ba a rasa nasara a wurin aiki ba.
Why do they want to talk to him? 	Me ya sa suke son yin magana da shi?
It will be interesting to know who's money.	Zai zama mai ban sha'awa don sanin kuɗin wane.
she was upset.	ta damu.
I understand it better now, a little bit.	Na fahimci shi da kyau yanzu, kadan kadan.
But the police are there.	Amma 'yan sanda suna can.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
Please read it if you have some time.	Da fatan za a karanta shi idan kuna da ɗan lokaci.
I'm sure he'll be fine and return home soon!	Na tabbata zai samu lafiya ya koma gida nan da wani lokaci!.
I hate the name.	Na ƙi sunan.
No wonder why.	Ba mamaki me yasa.
He gets things done.	Yana samun abubuwa.
Eventually you will die.	A ƙarshe za ku mutu.
I am ready for.	na shirya don.
I know nothing about it.	Ban san komai game da shi ba.
Absolutely no one.	Lallai babu kowa.
To use them, you must use thought.	Don amfani da su, dole ne ku yi amfani da tunani.
But it's good.	Amma yana da kyau.
17 people were killed.	An kashe mutane 17.
I'm sure you do too.	Na tabbata kai ma ka tuna.
Me ka ?.	Me ka?.
The work is not difficult.	Aikin ba shi da wahala.
You have to work for what you want.	Dole ne ku yi aiki don abin da kuke so.
How things were.	Yadda abubuwa suka kasance.
The man knew nothing.	Mutumin bai san komai ba.
You asked me to stay.	Sai ka ce in zauna.
Or what.	Ko menene .
It will not be difficult.	Ba zai yi wuya ba.
I hope we get more of our money.	Ina fata mun sami ƙarin kuɗin mu.
He wouldn’t tell me much about it.	Ba zai gaya mani da yawa game da shi ba.
I know nothing about this.	Ban san komai game da wannan ba.
Can you give me a way?	Za a iya ba ni hanya?
We never heard from him again.	Ba mu sake jin labarin ba.
It should go further.	Ya kamata ya kara fita.
Of course, it worked.	Tabbas, yayi aiki.
I walk next to her without fear.	Ina tafiya kusa da ita ba tare da tsoro ba.
They continued.	Suka ci gaba.
You will find each other.	Za ku sami juna.
He crossed the road.	Ya wuce hanya.
We'll talk in the morning.	Za mu yi magana da safe.
Whatever they can, they take.	Duk abin da za su iya, sun dauka.
The man ran away.	Mutumin ya gudu.
I highly recommend them.	Ina ba su shawarar sosai.
They were all done very carefully.	Duk an yi su sosai, a hankali.
The door below opened and closed.	Kofar da ke kasa ta bude ta rufe.
She explained that this was not her decision.	Ta bayyana cewa wannan ba ita ce shawarar ta ba.
He did it many times, you see.	Ya yi sau da yawa, ka gani.
They will be rewritten.	Za a sake rubuta su.
They are waiting for the train.	Suna jiran jirgin.
Give him a reading.	Ka ba shi karatu.
And I think she was right.	Kuma ina ganin ta yi gaskiya.
She could not say.	Ta kasa fada.
That is even more difficult.	Hakan ya fi wuya.
She does not drink water all day.	Duk ranar ba ta sha ruwa.
That doesn't work here.	Wannan baya aiki a nan.
And it is true.	Kuma gaskiya ne.
Hear it completely.	Ji shi gaba daya.
It gets better.	Yana kara kyau.
I want it protected.	Ina so ya kare.
I have no money now.	Ba ni da kuɗi yanzu.
So, overall, they were happy.	Don haka, a gaba ɗaya, sun yi farin ciki.
It worked for me, however.	Ya yi aiki a gare ni, duk da haka.
I really like it.	Na so sosai.
Maybe I eat too much.	Wataƙila ina cin abinci da yawa.
It should celebrate everything.	Yakamata yayi bikin komai.
Let's go again.	Bari kuma.
He was never selfish.	Bai taba son kai ba.
That's how you like to play.	Haka kuke son yin wasa.
Let's go together, tonight.	Mu tafi tare, yau da dare.
Sorry, you say.	Yi hakuri, ka ce.
No doubt, they were very happy.	Babu shakka, sun yi farin ciki sosai.
Your name will be known.	Za a san sunan ku.
She has only one job right now.	Aiki daya ne kawai take da ita yanzu.
I decided to let the story show the way.	Na yanke shawarar barin labarin ya nuna hanya.
The one who did it to him.	Wanda ya yi masa haka.
Everyone left me alone now.	Kowa ya bar ni ni kadai yanzu.
It won't stop there.	Ba zai tsaya nan ba.
She must decide what is right.	Dole ne ta yanke shawarar abin da ya dace.
Home is the place I was most worried about.	Gida shine wurin da ni na damu.
It's really scary.	Abin ban tsoro da gaske.
I am not myself.	Ni ban da kaina.
The water will be very hot.	Ruwan zai yi zafi sosai.
I did well.	Na yi kyau.
I went out completely.	Na fita gaba daya.
Give it to me.	Ka ba ni.
It has been used extensively in the past.	An yi amfani da shi sosai a baya.
It's not right, but it works for us, right now.	Ba daidai ba ne, amma yana aiki a gare mu, a yanzu.
Some even put it in coffee.	Wasu ma suna sanya shi a cikin kofi.
We'll see what happens.	Za mu ga abin da ya faru.
I waited	na jira
Where do you want to go for dinner.	Ina kuke so ku je cin abincin dare.
She expects to see the usual here.	Ta yi tsammanin ganin wanda ya saba a nan.
He never did these things.	Bai taɓa yin waɗannan abubuwan ba.
I could not believe it was happening to me.	Na kasa yarda da faruwa da ni.
It's easy to get lost here.	Yana da sauƙi a rasa a nan.
I only get one answer from the beginning.	Amsa daya kawai nake samu daga farko.
I will be the best person.	Zan zama mafi kyau mutum.
He didn't care.	Bai kula ba.
There are some things or money they can not buy.	Akwai wasu abubuwa ko kudi ba za su iya saya ba.
We are trying to fix this.	Muna ƙoƙarin gyara wannan.
They will come after you no matter where you are.	Za su zo bayan ku ko da inda kuke.
It's really real.	Yana da gaske sosai.
Water use is a major reuse.	Amfani da ruwa shine babban sake yin amfani da shi.
She is beautiful.	Ta yi kyau.
The work started early.	An fara aikin da wuri.
She is amazing.	Tana da ban mamaki.
This dress is so cute!	Wannan rigar tana da kyau sosai!
Now they can't.	Yanzu ba za su iya ba.
Drink with women, so far.	Sha da mata, ya zuwa yanzu.
But she told me that again today.	Amma ta sake gaya mani haka yau.
Thinking of something is good.	Tunanin wani abu yana da kyau.
I'll take the second one first.	Zan dauki na biyu na farko.
He has to increase his workload.	Dole ne ya ƙara yawan aikin sa.
Expect to travel a lot.	Yi tsammanin tafiya da yawa.
He said women could not be.	Ya ce mata ba zai iya zama ba.
Do not forget.	Kar a manta da .
You did not apply to stay here.	Ba ka nemi zama a nan ba.
Just a surprise.	Abin mamaki kawai.
We decided to stay now.	Mun yanke shawarar zama a yanzu.
The rest of the world.	Da sauran duniya.
Killing him like it wasn’t a big deal.	Ya kashe shi kamar ba wani babban abu ba ne.
It’s an exciting life they have to live.	Rayuwa ce mai ban sha'awa dole ne su yi rayuwa.
I know this is a bad time.	Na san wannan mummunan lokaci ne.
But more than that we certainly don’t need a trip.	Amma fiye da wannan tabbas ba mu buƙatar tafiya.
But maybe it's true.	Amma watakila gaskiya ne.
I see to this day.	Ina gani har yau.
That is unlikely to happen.	Da wuya hakan ya faru.
It would be hard to say.	Zai yi wuya a ce.
It's just what we do.	Abin da muke yi ne kawai.
Whatever they do, it works.	Duk abin da suke yi, yana aiki.
And he can.	Kuma ya iya.
You work up to them.	Kuna aiki har zuwa gare su.
The two came slowly.	Biyu sun zo a hankali.
She did me a favor.	Ta yi min kyakkyawan abu.
And we will change the world.	Kuma za mu canza duniya.
He became a man.	Ya koma mutum.
It took a bit of thinking for the next step.	Ya ɗauki ɗan tunani don gaba.
Hopefully it goes on and on.	Da fatan ya ci gaba da ci gaba.
I personally do not want that to happen.	Ni da kaina ba na son hakan ta faru.
This route is closed.	Wannan hanyar a rufe take.
Be careful with it.	Yi hankali da shi.
You will not do such a thing.	Ba za ku yi irin wannan abu ba.
That made the laughter hurt.	Shi ya sa dariya ta yi zafi.
He looked up.	Ya kalli sama.
Children today do not have time outside.	Yara a yau ba su da lokacin waje.
This is the first time he has really thought about it.	Wannan ne karo na farko da ya yi tunani da gaske game da shi.
No one knows where she is.	Ba wanda ya san inda take.
Go home.	Ka tafi gida.
But then you and the rest of life as a whole.	Amma sai ku da sauran rayuwa gaba ɗaya.
Of course you put in the project.	Tabbas kun saka cikin aikin.
He had to worry about illness.	Dole ne ya damu da rashin lafiya.
We live with it all the time.	Muna rayuwa da shi kullum.
But some seem to be faster than others.	Amma wasu sun zama kamar sun fi wasu sauri.
Some are worried.	Wasu sun damu.
It's late.	Gama dare yayi.
She took this feeling to heart.	Ta dauki wannan jin a rai.
He is not used to this.	Bai saba da wannan ba.
He took him home.	Ya kai shi gida.
But there is an easier way too.	Amma akwai hanya mafi sauƙi kuma.
It enjoys a good reputation.	Yana jin daɗin suna mai kyau.
He wanted her to go.	Ya so ta tafi.
So he did what he was supposed to do.	Don haka ya yi abin da ya kamata ya yi.
I have to make sure he is not dead.	Dole ne in tabbatar bai mutu ba.
I also thought.	Na kuma yi tunani.
Second, it is not common.	Na biyu, ba na kowa ba ne.
Explain the method you used.	Bayyana hanyar da kuka yi amfani da ita.
You can write it any way.	Kuna iya rubuta shi ta kowace hanya.
So, he made a cool call.	Don haka, ya yi kira mai sanyi.
They are scary to me, but they have money.	Suna da ban tsoro a gare ni, amma suna da kuɗi.
You're on time.	Kuna kan lokaci.
They took us on the road quickly.	Sun kai mu kan hanya da sauri.
He did not think so.	Bai yi tunanin haka ba.
He said.	Yace.
It will not do.	Ba zai yi ba.
It was rejected.	An ƙi shi.
I bumped or something.	Na yi karo ko wani abu.
No third-party functionality has been identified.	Ba a gano wani aiki na na uku ba.
Here is the problem.	Ga matsalar hakan.
I saw him immediately.	Na ga shi nan da nan.
He did not get involved in this.	Bai shiga cikin wannan ba.
We tested through you.	Mun gwada ta hanyar ku.
It looks like a lot of fun.	Ana ganin abin farin ciki ne.
He lost what he was doing.	Ya rasa me yake yi.
Let's fix it.	Mu gyara.
So you want to make the world a better place?	Don haka kuna son sanya duniya ta zama wuri mafi kyau?
They always did well.	Kullum sun yi kyau.
He'll be back soon.	Zai dawo nan da ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Only for this one time.	Kawai na wannan lokaci guda.
Probably not.	Wataƙila bai kamata ba.
But she is not here.	Amma ba ta nan.
We are just kids.	Mu yara ne kawai.
To be honest.	A gaskiya.
You have to try to get more.	Dole ne ku yi ƙoƙarin samun ƙarin.
Rainfall capacity.	Damar ruwan sama.
It's late.	Dama dare yayi.
They could not run away from me.	Ba su iya gudu da ni ba.
I need both.	Na bukata duka biyu.
Great stay together, of course.	Babban zama tare, ba shakka.
She pointed slowly.	Ta nuna a hankali.
It's hot here.	Yana da zafi a nan.
This is a good idea.	Wannan kyakkyawan tunani ne.
She stopped working immediately.	Ta daina aiki nan take.
I do a lot for you.	Ina yi muku da yawa.
At one point we did.	A wani lokaci mun yi.
He lost everything.	Ya bata komai.
Stay close.	Tsaya kusa.
It works all the time.	Yana aiki kowane lokaci.
Sometimes they are right.	Wani lokaci suna da gaskiya.
He went there.	Ya tafi can.
I was amazed at what she wrote about me.	Na yi mamakin abin da ta rubuta game da ni.
This is a great game.	Wannan wasa ne mai girma.
It tells the story of things that are closer to home.	Yana ba da labarin abubuwan da suka fi kusa da gida.
Do not forget.	Kar a manta.
I am not interested in all this.	Ba ni da sha'awar duk wannan.
I was afraid of that.	Na ji tsoron haka.
It's you.	Yana da kai.
They do not like each other, they said.	Ba sa son juna, in ji su.
They think he is not lost.	Suna tunanin bai rasa ba.
People asked how it happened.	Mutane sun tambayi yadda abin ya faru.
Either way it was right for me.	Ko ta yaya hakan ya zama daidai a gare ni.
By the end of the month the project was completed.	A karshen wata an gama aikin.
She needed to get ready.	Ta bukata ta shirya.
But they love each other.	Amma suna son juna.
We sell for sure.	Muna sayar da ranar tabbas.
So use tools.	Don haka amfani da kayan aiki.
That's good.	Hakan yayi kyau.
He told me to try.	Ya ce in gwada.
The plane collided with another on the bow.	Jirgin ya yi karo da wani a kan baka.
Maybe they stayed at home.	Wataƙila sun zauna a gida.
It is a pleasure to meet you.	Abin farin ciki ne na ci karo da ku.
That was a good thing.	Wannan ya kasance mai daɗi.
I see that they make a lot of money.	Na ga cewa suna samun kuɗi mai yawa.
We want to know what will happen when they are together.	Muna so mu san abin da zai faru idan suna tare.
It should not be a problem for you.	Bai kamata ya zama matsala a gare ku ba.
Let's do it.	Mu yi yi.
I can say a lot.	Zan iya cewa da yawa.
So this is completely open.	Don haka wannan gaba daya a bude yake.
All this has changed.	Duk wannan ya canza.
She could not cry.	Ta kasa kuka.
We have to get there.	Dole mu isa can.
There is something else at work, too.	Akwai wani abu kuma a wurin aiki, kuma.
To tell you the truth, it's a little weird.	In gaya maka gaskiya, ta dan ban mamaki.
He has to do it.	Dole ne ya yi.
I can do one like this.	Zan iya yin guda ɗaya kamar haka.
I would have paid more attention.	Da na kara kula.
I hope you can help me.	Ina fata za ku iya taimaka mini.
Read the article.	Karanta labarin.
Like time has passed slowly.	Kamar lokaci ya wuce a hankali.
Another woman replied.	Wata mata ta amsa.
I have a job to do at the station.	Ina da wani aiki da zan yi a tashar.
She also told him where she came from.	Ita ma ta fada masa inda ta fito.
Getting too sad.	Samun bakin ciki da yawa.
It is easy to operate.	Yana da sauƙi don aiki.
It's a lot.	Yana da yawa.
I did not kill him.	Ban kashe shi ba.
You do not know how.	Ba ku san yadda ba.
I wouldn’t mind getting one.	Ba zan damu da samun daya ba.
Does this carry water?	Shin wannan yana ɗaukar ruwa?
They could not find out where he was.	Sun kasa gano inda yake.
I did what I was asked.	Na yi abin da aka tambaye ni.
Things don’t go that way, however.	Abubuwa ba su yi daidai ba haka, duk da haka.
You did well.	Ka yi kyau.
You may not understand.	Wataƙila ba za ku gane ba.
It became my place too.	Ya zama wuri na kuma.
It should not be difficult.	Bai kamata ya zama mai wahala ba.
I seem to know him.	Da alama na san shi.
This is the right place.	Wannan shi ne wurin da ya dace.
Only women know now.	Mata ne kawai suka sani yanzu.
He acted like a sleeper.	Ya yi kamar mai barci.
It must be drunk every night at the same time.	Dole ne a sha kowane dare a lokaci guda.
He is cold now and tired.	Ya yi sanyi yanzu kuma ya gaji.
But a lot of things are familiar to me.	Amma abubuwa da yawa sun saba da ni.
These go hand in hand.	Waɗannan suna tafiya da juna.
We admit that they were not.	Mun yarda cewa ba su kasance ba.
But no one can do it.	Amma babu wanda zai iya yi.
I will show you how to do this.	Zan nuna muku yadda ake yin wannan.
It could happen tomorrow.	Yana iya faruwa gobe.
I think it's amazing.	Ina tsammanin abin mamaki ne.
I was amazed at how long he had been waiting for us.	Na yi mamakin tsawon lokacin da ya ke jiran mu.
It makes you feel right.	Yana sa ka ji daidai.
But no more.	Amma ba kuma.
I see some fish there.	Ina ganin wasu kifi a can.
Required.	An bukata.
Everything to talk about.	Duk abin da za a yi magana da ita.
Some are married, some are not.	Wasu sun yi aure, wasu ba su yi ba.
It happened to all of us.	Ya faru da mu duka.
No one spoke to him.	Babu wanda yayi masa magana.
Really stop growing.	Ainihin daina girma.
I feel very comfortable.	Ina jin dadi sosai.
Not every night.	Ba kowane dare ba.
We'll be back soon.	Za mu zo nan da wani lokaci.
There is.	Akwai.
Next month.	Wata mai zuwa.
It is not easy to write that.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi rubuta hakan ba.
I think there are two things in that.	Ina tsammanin akwai abubuwa guda biyu a cikin hakan.
There is just the feeling that something big is happening to me.	Akwai kawai jin cewa wani babban abu yana faruwa da ni.
The fight is over.	An gama fada.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane.
He was amazed at how well she was.	Yayi mamakin yadda ta kasance.
You will do this now.	Za ku yi wannan a yanzu.
I always like to travel.	A koyaushe ina son tafiya.
You have the last meal.	Kuna da abincin ƙarshe.
We had a lot of fun together.	Mun sha jin daɗi tare.
See for yourself.	Duba da kanku.
And no one bothered in the end.	Kuma ba wanda ya damu a ƙarshe.
But it is still difficult.	Amma har yanzu yana da wuya.
I want to know what people are saying.	Ina so in san abin da mutane ke cewa.
Do not delay.	Kar a bata lokaci.
It's hard for me.	Yana da wuya a gare ni.
It costs a lot of money and a lot of effort.	Yana ɗaukar kuɗi da yawa da ƙoƙari mai yawa.
But no one will.	Amma ba wanda zai.
I killed him.	Na kashe shi.
So it started.	Don haka ya fara.
We did not pass, we passed.	Ba mu wuce ba, mun wuce.
We take care of many children.	Muna kula da yara da yawa.
I love her, I always have and always will.	Ina son ta, koyaushe ina da kuma koyaushe.
But they still suggest opportunities.	Amma har yanzu suna ba da shawarar dama.
So please let me test myself for all of you.	Don haka don Allah bari in gwada kaina a gare ku duka.
Cold but sunny.	Mai sanyi amma rana.
He loves this.	Yana son wannan.
They used to live there.	Sun saba zama a wurin.
She can remember him very well now.	Za ta iya tuna shi sosai yanzu.
And it seems to work.	Kuma da alama yana aiki.
People stood together.	Mutane sun tsaya tare.
You did a great job there.	Kun yi kyakkyawan aiki a can.
He told me he would take care of it.	Ya ce mani zai kula da shi.
I was like, this is really big.	Na kasance kamar, wannan yana da girma sosai.
That surprised me.	Hakan ya bani mamaki.
After all, she knew that everything was fine for her.	Bayan haka, ta san cewa komai yayi mata kyau.
This house felt that way.	Wannan gidan ya ji haka.
But these are probably there too.	Amma waɗannan tabbas suna can ma.
But it's good.	Amma yana da kyau.
This is not unusual in such a place.	Hakan ba sabon abu ba ne a irin wannan wuri.
Nothing has changed here, either.	Babu wani abu da ya canza a nan, kuma.
So it was not easy.	Don haka bai kasance mai sauƙi ba.
The same thing happened to a woman.	Haka abin ya faru da wata mata.
I will not take it.	Ba zan dauka ba.
I do not hear you.	Ba na jin ku.
He is lost.	Ya bata.
They work fast too.	Suna aiki da sauri kuma.
She never did.	Ba ta taba yi ba.
A lot of things look like it.	Abubuwa da yawa sun yi kama da ita.
What’s so amazing about it? 	Menene ban mamaki game da shi?
He said.	Yace.
Everyone spoke one by one.	Kowa yayi magana daya bayan daya.
But this is still good.	Amma wannan har yanzu yana da kyau.
It makes us.	Yana sa mu.
Or, in fact, I was scared.	Ko, a gaskiya, na tsoro.
He checked the time.	Ya duba lokaci.
We can work there or upstairs.	Za mu iya aiki a can ko sama sama.
They can't do anything.	Ba za su iya yin komai ba.
I want to come back and say something about it.	Ina so in dawo in ce wani abu game da shi.
Life on the moon would be amazing.	Rayuwa akan wata zai zama abin ban mamaki.
But this is not the only surprise.	Amma ba wannan ba ne kawai abin mamaki da ya faru ba.
But you can't come with us.	Amma ba za ku iya zuwa tare da mu ba.
We have nothing to lose by trying.	Ba mu da abin da za mu rasa ta hanyar ƙoƙari.
The task is difficult, but necessary.	Aikin yana da wahala, amma dole.
He saw no reason to bring anyone.	Bai ga dalilin da zai kawo wani ba.
The man drank.	Mutumin ya sha abin sha.
No later.	Babu daga baya.
We are in this room.	Mu a wannan dakin.
Believe right.	Ka ba da gaskiya daidai.
We never talked about it again.	Ba mu sake yin magana game da shi ba.
And he arrived early.	Kuma ya isa da wuri.
That will not happen to us.	Hakan ba zai faru da mu ba.
It's just, so.	Haka kawai, haka.
Just tell us when and where we will be there.	Kawai gaya mana lokacin da kuma inda kuma za mu kasance a wurin.
Maybe you are in the middle of the night.	Wataƙila kuna cikin lokacin dare.
He would wait, she thought.	Zai jira, ta yi tunani.
We have to look at that first.	Dole ne mu kalli hakan da farko.
We are doing an amazing job.	Muna yin aikin ban sha'awa.
They are in a boat.	Suna cikin jirgin ruwa.
He wants what he can't get.	Yana son abin da ba zai iya samu ba.
It felt like crying.	Ya ji kamar kuka.
By any means necessary.	Ta kowace hanya dole.
I'm telling the truth.	Gaskiya nake fada.
I have to find some.	Dole ne in sami wasu.
We live in a beautiful, comfortable house.	Muna zaune a wani kyakkyawan gida mai kyau.
We spent three months on the road.	Mun yi wata uku a hanya.
He never acted like he wasn’t.	Bai taba yin kamar wanda ba shi ba.
Then she got up and raised her hand.	Sai ta tashi, ta daga hannu.
There are several reasons why I decided to leave.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da suka sa na yanke shawarar barin.
Do not use.	Kada ku yi amfani.
That way, it's not.	Wannan hanyar, ba haka ba.
I did not see this.	Ban ga wannan ba.
Or what is that.	Ko menene hakan.
Simple program.	Shirin mai sauƙi.
I'm sure.	Na tabbata.
I was the one who got into trouble.	Ni ne ya sami matsala.
To come or go.	Don zuwa ko tafiya.
The road is cold.	Hanyar ta yi sanyi.
Hope to see.	Da fatan za a gani .
That will never work.	Wannan ba zai taba yin aiki ba.
She is real.	Ita ce ta gaske.
And there is a lot to fight for.	Kuma akwai da yawa don yin faɗa.
The future is now.	Gaba ta zama yanzu.
She did a good job.	Ta yi aiki mai kyau.
Last night, now again.	Daren jiya, yanzu kuma.
It is a mistake.	Kuskure ne.
He knew they were going more than that now.	Ya san suna tafiya fiye da haka yanzu.
Some have made mistakes.	Su wasu sun yi kuskure.
Just reading about them will not help.	Karanta game da su kawai ba zai taimaka ba.
You are told to do so.	An ce ka yi haka.
I know it happened somehow.	Na san ya faru ko ta yaya.
Both, of course.	Duka, ba shakka.
One of us, now.	Daya daga cikin mu, yanzu.
God knows what will happen if you do.	Allah Ya san abin da zai faru idan kuka yi haka.
At least she would not be afraid to offend anyone.	Ko kadan ba za ta ji tsoron bata wa kowa rai ba.
We'll see something like this just.	Za mu ga wani abu kamar wannan kawai.
She had no idea what she was doing.	Bata san me take yi ba.
A lot has happened since then.	Da yawa sun faru tun lokacin.
Cold for real.	Sanyi ga ainihin.
Are they right?	Shin sun yi daidai?.
This is not true anymore.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne kuma.
We went with that.	Mun tafi da cewa.
This does not work.	Wannan baya aiki.
I see no way around that.	Ban ga wata hanya a kusa da hakan ba.
I think that will help her a lot.	Ina ganin hakan zai taimaka mata sosai.
But this we can not just do.	Amma wannan ba za mu iya kawai yi ba.
You may find them useful to read.	Kuna iya samun su da amfani karatu.
He began to make sense.	Ya fara yin hankali.
I think one is trying.	Ina tsammanin mutum yana ƙoƙari.
I am ready for.	Na shirya don.
He will look for opportunities to come to you.	Zai nemi damar zuwa wurin ku.
Often.	Sau da yawa.
Call if there is anything you need.	Kira idan akwai wani abu da kuke bukata.
And from myself.	Kuma daga kaina.
Everyone knows that.	Kowa ya san haka.
I told her so.	Na gaya mata haka.
The right way.	Hanyar ta dace.
She wrote only once.	Ta rubuta sau ɗaya kawai.
Actually we do not want more.	A gaskiya ba ma son ƙarin.
He does the work that few people do.	Yana yin aikin da mutane kaɗan suke yi.
This is a lie.	Wannan karya ce.
You don't live here, you see, not really.	Ba ka zaune a nan, ka gani, ba da gaske ba.
He is here and now.	Ya kasance a nan da yanzu.
I am a police officer, and good.	Ni dan sanda ne, kuma mai kyau.
She may never feel that way about anyone else.	Wataƙila ba za ta taɓa jin haka game da kowa ba.
It is not that simple.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi haka ba.
They travel very fast.	Suna tafiya sosai.
It is not uncommon to see this.	Kar a saba ganin hakan.
Not us, them.	Ba mu ba, su.
Too bad.	Mummunan kuma.
This correction is minimal.	Wannan gyara kadan ne.
Eat everything you feel right now.	Ku ci duk abin da kuke ji a yanzu.
When we were ready.	Lokacin mun shirya.
And today he did.	Kuma yau ya yi.
Otherwise, he would never enter the game.	Idan ba haka ba, ba zai taba shiga wasan ba.
But he does not see why this is changing.	Amma bai ga dalilin da ya sa hakan ya canza abubuwa ba.
Send it up.	Aika shi sama.
That was only a short time.	Hakan ya kasance ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
But they did and we are here.	Amma sun yi kuma muna nan.
Hopefully a few things will be remembered.	Da fatan za a tuna da wasu abubuwa kaɗan.
It’s fast and it’s a good time.	Yana da sauri kuma yana da lokaci mai kyau.
She never liked this teacher.	Ba ta taba son wannan malamin ba.
I know that at some point it did.	Na san cewa a wani lokaci ya yi.
It is growing slowly.	Yana girma a hankali.
I will bring back dinner for everyone.	Zan dawo da abincin dare don kowa.
They will know you are here.	Za su san kana nan.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a tabbata ko sun taɓa samun ba.
That day was too much for her.	Wannan rana ta yi mata yawa.
Tell him we want to talk to him.	Ka gaya masa muna son magana da shi.
I would have died.	Da na mutu.
I got involved in life just like everyone else.	Na shiga cikin rayuwa kamar kowa.
They met at a local restaurant.	Sun hadu a wani gidan cin abinci na gida.
And my favorite.	Kuma abin da na fi so.
They said nothing to him.	Ba komai suka ce masa.
It looks like.	Yayi kama.
This will eventually be your home.	Wannan zai zama gidan ku a ƙarshe.
This driver showed me a lot.	Wannan tuƙi ya nuna mini da yawa.
Nothing can change that.	Babu wani abu da zai iya canza hakan.
It doesn't need to say anything.	Bata bukatar cewa komai.
What makes them interested is what makes them catch.	Abin da ke sa su sha'awar shi ne ya sa su kama.
That is not enough.	Wannan bai isa ba.
Maybe he doesn’t need to be here for that.	Wataƙila bai buƙatar zama a nan don wannan ba.
Will this work?	Shin wannan zai yi aiki?.
However, they must hurry.	Duk da haka, dole ne su yi sauri.
But you are right.	Amma kai gaskiya ne.
Kill her.	Ka kashe ta.
Give it and you're done.	Ka ba shi kuma ka gama.
This is for children.	Wannan na yara ne.
Detected once each.	An gano sau ɗaya kowace.
They are also more difficult to do.	Su ma sun fi wuya a yi.
Like this here.	Kamar wannan a nan.
They want us to be scared.	Suna son mu ji tsoro.
Maybe you can't.	Wataƙila ba za ku iya ba.
They were funny, they had something to say.	Sun kasance masu ban dariya, suna da abin da za su ce.
I did not eat it.	Ban ci shi ba.
Or maybe you.	Ko watakila ku.
I just walked.	Na dan yi tafiya.
He did not feel right.	Bai ji ba daidai ba.
It is nothing.	Ba wani abu ba ne.
He has to get out of here.	Dole ya fita daga nan.
I got into this thing without knowing exactly what this game was.	Na shiga cikin wannan abu ba tare da sanin ainihin menene wannan wasan ba.
Tell you what.	Faɗa muku ko.
I am growing up now.	Ina girma yanzu.
It's too big.	Yana da girma da yawa.
Do not talk to them!	Kar ku yi magana da su!
He kept looking down.	Ya ci gaba da kallon kasa.
He laughed and said he did not need to.	Wani irin dariya yayi, yace baya bukata.
You can not see what we saw.	Ba za ku iya ganin abin da muka gani ba.
I am a very good person.	Ni mutum ne mai kyau sosai.
This is very good.	Wannan yana da kyau sosai.
I think it shouldn't.	Ina tsammanin bai kamata ba.
We will do the same.	Haka za mu yi.
However, it is very difficult.	Duk da haka, yana da wahala sosai.
Can be at any time of the day.	Za a iya zama a kowane lokaci na rana.
They did not participate in the project.	Ba su shiga cikin aikin ba.
You may be able to get help sooner than before.	Kuna iya samun taimako da wuri fiye da na baya.
If only you had lied to me.	Da a ce ka yi min karya.
But, for a while, he left me behind.	Amma, na ɗan lokaci, ya bar ni a baya.
I just left it.	Na bar shi kawai.
He understands it now.	Ya gane shi yanzu.
Maybe you can think of something ?.	Wataƙila za ku iya tunanin wani abu?.
Or lying.	Ko kuma yin karya.
Let it finish.	Bari ya gama.
We can leave you to her.	Za mu iya barin ku zuwa gare ta.
Show that these are correct.	Nuna cewa waɗannan sun yi daidai.
He did not want us to worry.	Bai so mu damu ba.
I feel finished.	Na ji dadi an gama.
At that point, he did not stand a chance.	A wannan lokacin, bai tsaya wata dama ba.
Everyone is happy with this.	Kowa ya yi farin ciki da wannan.
There is no allegation that anything happened.	Babu zargin cewa wani abu ya faru.
It's not pleasant.	Ba abin dadi ba ne.
She could not allow herself to pass.	Ta kasa yarda ta wuce.
This is.	Wannan yana da.
It is the best.	Shi ne mafi kyau.
Don't worry, there are more things to come next!	Kar ku damu, akwai sauran abubuwan da za su zo a wannan gaba!.
Work is often faster than thought.	Aiki sau da yawa yana sauri fiye da tunani.
She hopes she makes him feel the same.	Ta yi fatan ita ma ta sa shi jin haka.
Turn it off.	A kashe shi.
I did not stop.	Ban tsaya ba.
Better not to have it.	Gara ba tare da shi ba.
It’s kind of about everything.	Yana da irin game da komai.
It made me cry.	Ya sa ni kuka.
Two and one are not always equal to three.	Biyu da ɗaya ba koyaushe yake daidai da uku ba.
I can't see how he will live.	Ba zan iya ganin yadda zai yi rayuwa ba.
That time is running out.	Cewa lokaci yayi.
You must take this opportunity.	Dole ne ku ɗauki wannan damar.
She has not yet returned home.	Har yanzu bata dawo gida ba.
When did she leave home?	Yaushe ta bar gida?
The next best thing.	Abu mafi kyau na gaba.
If you have access to me, call me.	Idan kana da damar zuwa gare ni, kira ni.
That's right.	Hakan yayi daidai.
Well, we will try through you.	Da kyau, za mu gwada ta hanyar ku.
But you heard it here.	Amma kun ji shi a nan.
He will be in charge of the project.	Shi ne zai kula da aikin.
You can play.	Kuna iya wasa.
He gives us all these things.	Yana ba mu duk waɗannan abubuwa.
He would not agree.	Ba zai yarda ba.
I know it's hard, but that's what we should do.	Na san yana da wuya, amma abin da ya kamata mu yi.
I know the way.	Na san hanya.
We got two others who were there.	Mun samu wasu biyu da suke wurin.
After all, the past is gone.	Bayan haka, abin da ya wuce ya wuce.
So this work is wrong.	Don haka wannan aikin ba daidai yake ba.
Not many did.	Ba da yawa suka yi ba.
The problem is how.	Matsalar ita ce ta yaya.
So she started laughing again.	Haka ta sake fara dariya.
We are not both.	Ba mu biyu ba.
We will try it.	Za mu gwada shi.
They will die.	Za su mutu.
It’s a lot, it’s scary.	Yana da yawa, yana da ban tsoro.
In the water, it.	A cikin ruwa, yana.
You should get some now.	Ya kamata ku sami wasu yanzu.
First, they are together.	Na farko, suna tare.
I got help.	Na samu taimako.
Somehow it came out well.	Ko ta yaya ya fito da kyau.
He is still here.	Har yanzu yana nan.
The water is cold.	Ruwan ya ji sanyi.
They cannot do all the work well.	Ba za su iya yin kowane aiki da kyau ba.
It's a short time.	Yana da ɗan lokaci.
I looked at everything.	Na kalli komai.
Looking good.	Neman kyau.
If it works, great.	Idan yana aiki, mai girma.
That is not how the world works.	Ba haka duniya take aiki ba.
It is the most amazing thing.	Shi ne abu mafi ban mamaki.
Then another, another.	Sai kuma wani, da wani.
Some items are easily available.	Wasu abubuwa ana samun su cikin sauƙi.
He said sure.	Yace tabbas.
He will not try to run away.	Ba zai yi ƙoƙari ya gudu ba.
In a very positive way.	Ta wata hanyar da ta dace.
Can't make a call today.	Ba za a iya yin kira a yau ba.
Now it comes out of my right.	Yanzu ya fito daga dama na.
Another place we know how to sit and wait.	Wani wurin da muka san yadda ake zama da jira.
They do not know what it is.	Ba su san menene ba.
Then he realized what had happened.	Sai ya gane abin da ya faru.
Or maybe he died.	Ko watakila ya mutu.
I think marriage and children.	Ina tsammanin aure da yara.
Today we went back to school.	Yau muka koma makaranta.
But that is nothing.	Amma cewa komai ba komai bane.
You play as you do.	Kuna wasa kamar yadda kuke yi.
This is not a new idea.	Wannan ba sabon tunani ba ne.
How do I check this.	Ta yaya zan duba wannan.
They will love you, but they want to be loved.	Za su so ku, amma suna son a so su.
I read your book.	Na karanta littafin ku.
He just gave you a way to do that.	Ya kawai ba ku hanyar da za ku yi hakan.
But I'm sorry.	Amma ka yi hakuri da ni.
Tell him everything you think is best.	Faɗa masa duk abin da kuke tunani mafi kyau.
It's interesting.	Yana da ban sha'awa.
I do not smoke.	Ba na shan taba.
You have to get it right.	Dole ne ku sami daidai da wannan.
Or if you do.	Ko kuma idan kun yi.
That hurts so much!	Hakan yayi zafi sosai!
Really, really bad.	Gaskiya, mummunan gaske.
You may not understand this.	Wataƙila ba za ku fahimci wannan ba.
This is me!	Wannan ni ne!
We are together in it now.	Muna tare a ciki yanzu.
He laughed and drank coffee.	Ya yi dariya ya sha kofi.
Show you here, too.	Nuna ku a nan, kuma.
You will only continue to be healthy.	Za a ci gaba da samun lafiya ne kawai.
And he is still with me.	Kuma har yanzu yana tare da ni.
We do not need more of this.	Ba ma buƙatar ƙarin wannan.
That time was right.	Wannan lokacin ya zama daidai.
It is enough to stop.	Yana isa ya tsaya.
Don't tell anyone you're leaving.	Kada ka gaya wa kowa kana fita.
I continued before he had a chance to say anything.	Na ci gaba kafin ya samu damar cewa komai.
The rain.	Da ruwan sama.
Work with it.	Aiki da ita.
She ran in the rain.	Ta gudu cikin ruwan sama.
This is cold.	Wannan sanyi ne.
That time is over.	Wannan lokacin ya wuce.
He was very optimistic.	Ya kasance yana da fata sosai.
Ask her.	Ka tambaye ta.
Someone else.	Wani ne.
Okay, you know.	Ya yi, ka sani.
Use good health, feel.	Yi amfani da lafiya mai kyau, ji.
Whatever it is.	Duk abin da yake shi ne.
I thought you would like to join me.	Na yi tsammanin za ku so ku shiga ni.
Like not everyone.	Kamar ba kowa.
God give me life.	Allah ka bani rai.
It's good to be back.	Yana da kyau ka dawo.
Of course she waited and that was fine.	Ya tabbata tana jira kuma hakan yayi kyau.
Unemployed for one year.	Ba shi da aikin yi tsawon shekara guda.
There must be people.	Dole ne a sami mutane.
If my opinion about this is new to you, read this.	Idan ji na game da wannan sabon abu ne a gare ku, karanta wannan.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
But no, it will not.	Amma a'a, ba zai kasance ba.
Tonight was a pleasant one, though.	Yau daren ya kasance mai daɗi, ko da yake.
But it can be fun to bring it up.	Amma yana iya zama abin daɗi don kawo ta.
It started now.	An fara shi yanzu.
They need something to eat.	Suna buƙatar abin da za su ci.
Maybe you remember it.	Wataƙila ka tuna da shi.
And changing jobs is difficult.	Kuma canza aiki yana da wahala.
I could not stop thinking about that.	Na kasa daina tunanin hakan.
What to do?	Me za a yi?
But he thinks they should not be.	Amma yana ganin bai kamata su kasance ba.
See what you do.	Kalli abin da kuke yi.
And he did, and went.	Kuma ya yi, ya tafi.
Do not play with them.	Kada a yi wasa da su.
I have not felt well for years.	Ban ji daɗi ba tsawon shekaru.
He will be caught, running behind.	Za a kama shi, yana gudu a baya.
No injuries were reported.	Babu wani rauni da ya samu.
The method used is advanced and simple.	Hanyar da aka yi amfani da ita ta ci gaba kuma mai sauƙi.
He has always been.	Ya kasance koyaushe.
He apologized for being late.	Ya ba da hakuri don ya makara.
She is intelligent.	Ita ce mai hankali.
At that time there was no place to go.	A lokacin babu wurin zuwa.
Care!	Kula!
I am living a good life.	Ina yin rayuwa mai kyau.
No, you are waiting.	A'a, kuna jira.
Only curious people will come here.	Masu son sani kawai za su zo nan.
It cannot go on like this.	Ba zai iya ci gaba kamar haka ba.
I try to find the best people.	Ina ƙoƙarin samun mafi kyawun mutane.
I want to let him catch me lying.	Ina son in bar shi ya kama ni yana karya.
I can't cover that.	Ba zan iya rufe hakan ba.
I am outside	Ina waje
You can't change other people.	Ba za ku iya canza wasu mutane ba.
I was happy with it.	Na yi farin ciki da shi.
It will make everything easier.	Zai sa komai ya fi sauƙi.
I played in a little bit.	Na yi wasa a cikin kaɗan.
It will really try.	Zai gwada da gaske.
So, he has a lot of money on hand.	Don haka, yana da kuɗi da yawa a hannu.
He must be safe.	Dole ne ya kasance lafiya.
He was the first to speak.	Shi ne ya fara magana.
Let's see about this.	Bari mu ga game da wannan.
Carry on!	Ci gaba!
Truth in falsehood.	Gaskiya a cikin karya.
Now, the real work has begun.	Yanzu, ainihin aikin ya fara.
It is a mistake.	Kuskure ne.
That's what we say.	Abin da muke cewa ke nan.
I am a fish out of water.	Ni kifi ne daga ruwa.
So you can start doing one.	Don haka kuna iya fara yin ɗaya.
They are a little interesting.	Suna zama ɗan ban sha'awa.
I walked closer to her.	Na shiga kusa da ita.
And it’s a job that seems to be really enjoyable.	Kuma aiki ne da alama yana jin daɗin gaske.
I do not want to divorce her.	Ba na so in sake ta.
Maybe they will come back eventually.	Wataƙila za su dawo a ƙarshe.
This house is very nice.	Wannan gidan yana da kyau sosai.
We do not have to wait for everyone.	Ba sai mun jira kowa ba.
Home is more than just a place to live.	Gida ya fi wurin zama kawai.
One more night.	Dare daya kuma.
People have passed.	Mutane sun wuce.
The door is closed.	Kofar ta rufe.
This is all a real game, they heard.	Duk wannan wasa ne na gaskiya, sun ji.
This opportunity is in everyone.	Wannan damar tana cikin kowane mutum.
He loves it.	Yana son shi.
And it's good, you know.	Kuma yana da kyau, ka sani.
So, you go.	Don haka, sai ku tafi.
She told him to run home.	Ta ce da shi ya gudu gida.
The house was exactly as it was shown.	Gidan ya kasance daidai kamar yadda aka nuna.
Thus we will be closer to the real material.	Ta haka za mu kasance kusa da ainihin kayan.
Did you hear anything about it?	Kun ji wani abu game da shi?
This is something new.	Wannan sabon abu ne.
A little surprised too.	Dan mamaki ma.
Enjoy.	Ka ji daɗi.
I keep talking.	Ina ci gaba da magana.
I care.	Na kula.
It could not be better.	Ba zai iya zama mafi kyau ba.
We do not know you.	Ba mu san ku ba.
Can this be done properly.	Shin za a iya yin hakan da kyau.
He could not imagine what had happened to him.	Ya kasa tunanin me ya faru da kansa.
You will make a mistake.	Za ku yi kuskure.
I'm sure you know these things.	Na tabbata kun san waɗannan abubuwan.
Not necessarily good.	Ba lallai ba ne mai kyau.
You can know who you are.	Kuna iya sanin cewa kai wane ne.
They will not go.	Ba za su je ba.
I never had time for myself.	Ban taba samun lokacin kaina ba.
It seems he wants to.	Da alama yana so.
After three days they decided to stop drinking.	Bayan kwana uku suka yanke shawarar su daina sha.
She usually works on weekends.	Ta kan yi aiki a karshen mako.
I will protect you.	Zan kare ku.
We know what they did.	Mun san abin da suka yi.
However, it is not.	Duk da haka, ba haka ba ne.
He will plan a trip.	Zai yi shirin tafiya.
There is nothing to go.	Babu abin da za a je.
Without.	Babu.
We enjoyed the delicious food at the restaurant.	Mun ji daɗin abinci mai daɗi a gidan abinci.
It changes the game.	Yana canza wasan.
He still hasn't said enough.	Har yanzu bai ce isa ba.
She needs a new dress.	Tana bukatar sabon riga.
Now be very careful.	Yanzu a kula sosai.
I have to quit.	Dole ne in daina.
She gasped in surprise and recognized him.	Ta fad'a cikin mamaki ta gane shi.
He proved it.	Ya tabbatar da haka.
I can see now that what I started doing was right.	Ina iya gani yanzu cewa abin da na fara yi daidai ne.
But this is not the day.	Amma ba wannan ranar ba ce.
They are just me or me.	Su ne kawai ko ni.
Anyway we will do it.	Duk da haka za mu yi shi.
You have too.	Kuna da ma.
Go outside.	Tafi waje.
But this is not for me.	Amma wannan ba nawa bane.
But still not here.	Amma har yanzu ba a nan.
We saw how it went for them.	Mun ga yadda abin ya kasance gare su.
What an interesting article!	Abin da labarin mai ban sha'awa!
We are watching them.	Muna kallon su.
You have to trust me.	Ya kamata ku yarda da ni.
He could not think of anything better.	Ya kasa tunanin wani abu mafi kyau.
Who else knows?	Sauran wa ya sani?.
I think it is.	Ina tsammanin yana da.
I do not understand why you would do that.	Ban fahimci dalilin da yasa za ku yi haka ba.
If you are sick, pretend you are healthy.	Idan ba ka da lafiya, yi kamar kana da lafiya.
It will not do you any good.	Ba zai yi muku kyau ba.
After a while the car stopped.	Bayan wani lokaci motar ta tsaya.
Nothing has ever made him so happy.	Babu wani abu da ya taɓa sa shi jin daɗi haka.
Make sure you enjoy this game.	Tabbatar ku ji daɗin wannan wasan.
Don’t do this about me.	Kada ku yi wannan game da ni.
I will do whatever it takes.	Zan yi duk abin da ya kamata.
It's not fun.	Ba abin jin daɗi ba ne.
It should grow well throughout the month.	Ya kamata a girma sosai a cikin wata.
But he does not want to.	Amma ba shi da so.
But you have shown that it is not right.	Amma kun nuna hakan bai yi daidai ba.
That was a problem for him.	Hakan ya kasance masa matsala.
We hope to have another child.	Muna fatan samun wani yaro.
The child cannot speak now.	Yaro baya iya magana yanzu.
They passed.	Suka wuce.
Thoughts come in handy.	Tunani yana zuwa cikin sauƙi.
This man laughed.	Wannan mutumin yayi dariya.
How quickly everything changed.	Yaya sauri komai ya canza.
I can work on that.	Zan iya aiki da hakan.
Seriously, check it out.	Da gaske, duba shi.
Whatever a person does you can do too.	Duk abin da wani mutum ya yi za ka iya yi ma.
It just won’t happen.	Kawai ba zai faru ba.
It just has to be.	Dole kawai.
Try not to add too much water.	Yi ƙoƙarin kada ku ƙara ƙarin ruwa da yawa.
This can be for a week or two.	Wannan yana iya zama na mako ɗaya ko biyu.
I'll do only one.	Zan yi daya kawai.
It should, but it is not.	Ya kamata amma ba haka bane.
You get coffee.	Kuna samun kofi.
I wish I didn't know.	Ina son ban sani ba.
And he plays very well.	Kuma yana wasa sosai.
Tell people what you know you need to accomplish.	Faɗa wa mutane abin da kuka san kuna buƙatar cika su.
Not as we do, of course.	Ba kamar yadda muke yi ba, ba shakka.
If not now, when ?.	Idan ba yanzu, yaushe?.
They want you to do well.	Suna son ku yi kyau.
But in the end, they hit it off.	Amma a ƙarshe, sun buga shi.
But he did not get a chance.	Amma bai samu damar ba.
This is the only one.	Wannan shi ne kadai.
Maybe he knows you better than you do.	Wataƙila ya fi ku sanin kanku.
We need more of that.	Muna buƙatar ƙarin hakan.
I came back from the meeting.	Na dawo daga taron.
Which is today.	Wanda yake a yau.
The water level has changed.	Ruwan ruwa ya canza.
We can leave.	Za mu iya barin.
Weep again.	Kuka kuma.
No one can hear us here.	Babu wanda zai iya jin mu a nan.
Not the way to go.	Ba hanyar tafiya ba.
We looked at each other.	Muka kalli juna.
I want him to enjoy the moment.	Ina so ya ji daɗin lokacin.
I'm surprised you.	Ina mamakin ku.
I like this place	Ina son wannan wurin
He said nothing.	Bai ce komai ba.
I should go now.	Ya kamata in tafi yanzu.
This fish is delicious.	Wannan kifi yana da dadi.
It's not good.	Ba ya da kyau.
The water is very cold.	Ruwan ya yi sanyi sosai.
But this is good.	Amma wannan yana da kyau.
With it for years, nothing could really fix it.	Da shi tsawon shekaru, babu abin da zai iya gyara shi da gaske.
It would be another benefit.	Zai zama wani amfani.
She answered no.	Ta amsa da a'a.
What cannot be taken for granted must be proved.	Dole ne a tabbatar da abin da ba za a iya ɗauka ba.
If kids run the world, it will be true.	Idan yara sun gudu duniya, zai zama gaskiya.
It was the ultimate pleasure.	Ita ce jin daɗi na ƙarshe.
I do not want to go.	Ban so in tafi.
She’s not funny.	Ba ta da ban dariya.
You are with her right to the end.	Kun kasance tare da ita dama har ƙarshe.
It will be there somewhere.	Zai kasance a can wani wuri.
I heard the water was turned on.	Na ji an kunna ruwan.
The whole day will be amazing.	Duk ranar za ta zama na ban mamaki.
It was easy.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi.
You must go to school every day.	Dole ne ku je makaranta kowace rana.
No one told him anything.	Babu wanda ya gaya masa komai.
I will not go.	Ba zan tafi ba.
I will write	zan rubuta
It's better than me.	Ya fi min kyau ma.
We are still.	Mun kasance har yanzu.
She is the first.	Ita ce ta farko.
Only one boat was there.	Wani jirgin ruwa daya kawai a wurin.
It can be done.	Ana iya yi.
You will not change it.	Ba za ku canza shi ba.
She knew she shouldn't worry.	Ta san bai kamata ta damu ba.
No one said much.	Babu wanda yace da yawa.
You will laugh again.	Za ku sake yin dariya.
He really felt they were right.	Da gaske ya ji su gaskiya ne.
Maybe I will change.	Wataƙila zan canza.
So there are a lot of things going on here.	Don haka akwai abubuwa da yawa da ke faruwa a nan.
They can go on.	Za su iya ci gaba.
This is not pleasant.	Wannan ba abin daɗi ba ne.
Everyone watched today's game.	Kowa ya kalli wasan na yau.
I asked him.	Na tambaye shi.
But something somewhere must.	Amma wani abu a wani wuri dole.
She is OK.	Tana yi lafiya.
She wouldn’t trust me.	Ba za ta yarda da ni ba.
If you have any problem, just call us.	Idan kuna da wata matsala, kawai a kira mu.
Somehow, kind of interesting.	Ko ta yaya, irin ban sha'awa.
All such materials.	Duk irin wannan kayan.
You know where everything is.	Kun san inda komai yake.
Everyone was very careful.	Kowa ya mai da hankali sosai.
He was if.	Ya kasance idan.
They did well.	Sun yi kyau.
I felt like he understood the story.	Na ji kamar ya fahimci labarin.
You are accustomed to this feeling.	Kun saba da wannan jin.
That gave him the opportunity.	Hakan ya ba shi dama.
We were there almost at the same time.	Muna can kusan lokaci guda.
No need to express myself.	Babu buƙatar bayyana kaina.
And it has never been done.	Kuma ba a taba yin hakan ba.
I know for sure.	Na san tabbas.
I never wore anything.	Ban taba saka wani abu ba.
It is his job.	Da aikin sa ne.
Maybe one day it will.	Wataƙila wata rana zai yi.
As it can be.	Kamar yadda zai iya zama.
I'm sorry.	Na yi hakuri.
We didn't think so.	Ba mu yi tunanin wannan ba.
He immediately realized that it was too late.	Nan da nan ya gane cewa ya makara.
They can be a problem in any hot water.	Suna iya zama matsala a kowane ruwan zafi.
But it must be something interesting.	Amma tabbas dole ne ya zama wani abu mai ban sha'awa.
And it is still going on.	Kuma har yanzu ana ci gaba.
So it will be written.	Don haka za a rubuta.
She gave a little.	Ta ba da kadan.
She got up and sat down quickly.	Ta tashi zaune da sauri.
The one who is nothing more.	Wanda bai fi komai ba.
You are making a mistake.	Kuna yin kuskure.
Lots of laughter.	Dariya da yawa.
Very good for sure.	Yayi kyau sosai tabbas.
I have to go out.	Dole ne in fita.
At the time, it seemed like a big deal.	A lokacin, ya zama kamar babban abu.
When people die, they go to heaven.	Lokacin da mutane suka mutu, suna zuwa sama.
I feel fine.	Ina jin lafiya.
Somehow he knew.	Ko ta yaya ya sani.
This unknown thing was horrible.	Wannan abin da ba a sani ba ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
That night she did her usual thing.	A daren nan ta yi abin da ta saba.
She did well with it.	Ta yi kyau da shi.
Doing it is hard work.	Yin shi aiki ne mai wahala.
But that is over.	Amma wannan ya wuce.
I think it will be done.	Ina tsammanin za a yi.
There is something that brought it to us.	Akwai abin da ya kawo mana ita.
He is coming to play with me.	Yana zuwa ya yi wasa da ni.
He took it upon himself to recognize one.	Ya dauka ya gane daya.
I do not know if we can win.	Ban sani ba ko za mu iya yin nasara.
It’s a lot as to be clear, you start.	Yana da yawa kamar yadda za a bayyana, ka fara.
He can swim better than them.	Zai iya yin iyo fiye da su ma.
And you can't do anything with that.	Kuma ba za ku iya yin komai da wannan ba.
I am well prepared.	Na shirya sosai.
I don't know where to start.	Ban san ta ina zan fara ba.
He left them and walked by himself.	Ya bar su, ya yi tafiya da kansa.
Of course not.	Ko shakka babu.
It happens that people come back together.	Yana faruwa ne mutane suka dawo tare.
I could live without it.	Zan iya rayuwa ba tare da hakan ba.
Today she left me behind.	Yau ta bar ni a baya.
They did not go.	Ba su tafi ba.
It doesn’t work that way.	Ba ya aiki ta hanya.
Many people stopped working.	Mutane da yawa sun daina aiki.
I highly recommend this.	Ina ba da shawarar wannan sosai.
Often lost his job.	Sau da yawa rasa aiki.
Do what you want.	Yin abin da kuke so.
It didn't take long.	Bai dade ba.
I was shocked and surprised.	Na damu da ban mamaki.
Had it not been for that.	Da ba a can ba.
People often want food to run faster.	Mutane sau da yawa suna son abinci ya yi sauri.
This is definitely true.	Wannan babu shakka gaskiya ne.
He told him it was going well.	Ya ce masa ana tafiya lafiya.
I don't feel well.	Ban ji sosai ba.
I don’t think it’s something to worry about.	Bana tunanin wani abu ne da zai damu.
Not trying to sit still.	Ba ƙoƙarin zama ba.
Do whatever you have to do.	Yi duk abin da za ku yi.
He just got it.	Ya samu kawai.
I didn’t miss a lot of drinking, though.	Ban rasa sha da yawa ba, ko.
It's just sad.	Abin bakin ciki ne kawai.
It's inside.	Yana ciki.
You are running well.	Kuna gudu da kyau.
He was lost and he knew.	Ya bata kuma ya sani.
No one should catch her.	Babu wanda ya isa ya kama ta.
He told me to call him immediately.	Ya ce in kira shi nan da nan.
Everything we have so far is a name.	Duk abin da muka samu zuwa yanzu suna ne.
You are right about us being happy, for a while we were.	Kun yi gaskiya game da mu muna farin ciki, na ɗan lokaci mun kasance.
I have more than enough.	Ina da fiye da isa.
When the doctor told him the story, he cried.	Da likitan ya gaya masa labarin, sai ya yi kuka.
Sorry everyone, she thought.	Yi hakuri kowa, ta yi tunani.
He got in the way.	Ya shiga hanya.
I have not been cold for years.	Ban yi sanyi ba tsawon shekaru.
Or, he agrees.	Ko kuma, ya yarda.
she is surprised.	tana mamaki.
This work is easy enough.	Wannan aikin yana da sauƙi isa.
They also don't want to hear it.	Su ma ba sa son su ji shi.
Of course they failed.	Tabbas sun kasa.
But they failed.	Amma sun kasa.
There are several nearby.	Akwai da dama a kusa.
Don't last too long.	Kada ku dade da yawa.
So yes, we did him a favor.	Don haka a, mun yi masa kyau.
You thought they needed it.	Kun yi tsammanin suna bukata.
Everyone knows it.	Kowa ya san shi.
The children are fine.	Yara suna lafiya.
He was so amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki sosai.
They will not save him, they will kill him.	Ba za su ajiye shi ba, za su kashe shi.
She read it and it was amazing.	Ta karanta kuma tana da ban mamaki.
And we must tell people the truth, as we see it.	Kuma dole ne mu gaya wa mutane gaskiya, kamar yadda muke gani.
Yet she failed to make it.	Amma duk da haka ta kasa sanya shi.
He did nothing again.	Bai sake yin komai ba.
But you have to be serious.	Amma dole ne ku kasance da gaske.
The same goes for eating out.	Haka cin abinci yake a waje.
She was not.	Ba ta kasance ba.
I ran there.	Na gudu can.
I will not do that.	Ba zan yi haka ba.
I looked at my thoughts for a moment.	Na kalli tunani na na ɗan lokaci.
It hurts.	Ya ji zafi.
But nothing at the time.	Amma ba komai a lokacin.
What is to be done.	Menene abin da dole ne a yi.
But something went wrong.	Amma wani abu ya kasance ba daidai ba.
I hope to join you.	Ina fatan shiga cikin ku,.
Call us once in a while.	Kira mu sau ɗaya a wani lokaci.
You have to want to be the best.	Dole ne ku so ku zama mafi kyau.
He will see how it is.	Zai ga yadda ta kasance.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
I was happy to have it.	Na yi farin ciki da samun shi.
After that, it will be us there.	Bayan haka, zai kasance mu a can.
Everything works fine but the work.	Komai yayi aiki lafiya amma aikin.
He brought it back.	Ya dawo da shi.
I get that.	Ina samun haka.
Maybe we are late.	Wataƙila mun makara.
But everyone says we sold.	Amma kowa yana cewa mun sayar.
Show something working.	Nuna wani abu da ke aiki.
I will stay there again.	Zan sake zama a can.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Everyone must help us.	Dole ne kowa ya taimake mu.
It seems to come out of it.	Da alama ya fito daga ciki.
I went back inside myself and continued to work.	Na koma cikin kaina na ci gaba da aiki.
Nice to meet you.	Na yi farin cikin samun ku.
It has to be something in the water.	Dole ne ya zama wani abu a cikin ruwa.
So you don’t care what’s going on in the world?	Don haka ba ku damu da abin da ke faruwa a duniya ba?
Help should be together.	Taimakon ya kamata ya kasance tare.
Okay, really.	Yayi kyau, a gaskiya.
I tried to protect them.	Na yi ƙoƙarin kare su.
They are good here.	Suna da kyau a nan.
It looks like it's raining.	Gani yayi kamar ana ruwa.
So pay attention to what you do.	Don haka ku kula da abin da kuke yi.
And you know it too.	Kuma ka san shi ma.
Surprise once for who they are.	Mamaki sau ɗaya ga wanda suke yi wa.
I want to hear other people do things.	Ina so in ji wasu mutane suna yin abubuwa.
So you see, you can't leave yet.	Don haka kun ga, ba za ku iya barin ba tukuna.
It has nothing to do with me.	Ba shi da komai a gare ni.
This does not happen very often.	Hakan ba ya faruwa sau da yawa.
I did not hear from them.	Ban ji daga gare su ba.
They knew this place before, but it has been there before.	Sun san wannan wurin a da, duk da haka ya kasance a da.
I do so so it is good.	Ina haka don haka yana da kyau.
The car should be refueled.	Motar ya kamata a sake mai.
I'm sorry.	Na yi hakuri da hakan.
He was running and playing.	Yana ta gudu yana wasa.
I read it and I think it is good.	Na karanta kuma ina tsammanin yana da kyau.
So be prepared.	Don haka a shirya.
It could not be otherwise.	Ba zai iya zama in ba haka ba.
Maybe it will make her happy.	Watakila zai kawo mata farin ciki.
She got pregnant.	Ta samu ciki.
We hope only one of our readers will enjoy it.	Muna tsammanin daya ne masu karatu za su ji daɗi.
You'd better come right away if you know anything about it.	Gara ku zo nan da nan idan kun san wani abu game da shi.
They could not find one. 	Sun kasa samun daya. 
This is what they want more than anything else in the world.	Abin da suke so ke nan fiye da komai a duniya.
I do not know exactly how to tell you this.	Ban san ainihin yadda zan gaya muku wannan ba.
Dogs are not allowed inside.	Ba a yarda da kare a ciki.
No one has a problem with that, except me.	Babu wanda ke da matsala da wannan, sai ni.
You will not stay.	Ba za ku zauna ba.
No one wants to be told how to enjoy a game.	Ba wanda yake son a gaya masa yadda ake jin daɗin wasa.
They deliver food to her.	Suna kai mata abinci.
And don’t think it will be easier after thirty years.	Kuma kada ku yi tunanin zai fi sauƙi bayan shekaru talatin.
But they have mine too.	Amma suna da nawa ma.
Be very careful.	Yi hankali sosai.
In life, really.	A rayuwa, da gaske.
They will do what they think is right.	Za su yi abin da suke ganin daidai ne.
I want to hate this person.	Ina so in ƙi wannan mutumin.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata nawa ba.
I never thought of that again.	Ban sake tunanin hakan ba.
She wouldn’t use them, though.	Ba za ta yi amfani da su ba, ko da yake.
I will try for that.	Zan gwada don haka.
But at the time, he never really left.	Amma a lokacin, bai taɓa barin gaske ba.
She has a head for the truth.	Ta na da kai ga gaskiya.
I did not find anything.	Ban sami komai ba.
He made a lot of money.	Ya sami kuɗi da yawa kuma.
With interest.	Tare da sha'awa.
I wonder what you think about it.	Ina mamakin me kuke tunani game da shi.
He has been with us for over a year now.	Yana tare da mu sama da shekara guda yanzu.
We looked at each other.	Muka kalli juna.
It should be an interesting game.	Ya kamata ya zama wasa mai ban sha'awa.
I have to leave my dog ​​behind.	Dole na bar kare na a baya.
We took it.	Mun dauka.
We cannot let that happen, not now.	Ba za mu iya barin hakan ta faru ba, ba yanzu ba.
She didn't feel any pain.	Ba ta ji wani zafi ba.
It was easy to do.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi a yi.
It may take some time.	Yana iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
From there they could not see anything.	Daga can ba su iya ganin komai ba.
So, check it out.	Don haka, duba shi.
I never did anything.	Ban taba komai ba.
We did not do that.	Ba mu yi haka ba.
You took the train with me.	Da ka ɗauki jirgin tare da ni.
Who does not want to do it, yet.	Wanda ba ta so ta yi, ba tukuna.
I do not know.	Ban sani ba.
Write a lot.	Rubuta da yawa.
It remains to be seen if this will happen.	Abin jira a gani ko hakan zai faru.
They felt it was hard to keep working there.	Sun ji yana da wuya a ci gaba da aiki a wurin.
There was nothing he did.	Babu wani abu da ya taɓa yi.
But people missed it.	Amma mutane sun rasa shi.
It has to grow.	Dole ne ya girma.
He repaired the ground.	Ya gyara kasa.
I feel sleepy.	Ina jin rashin barci.
Don't worry if you can't do it.	Kada ku damu idan ba za ku iya yin shi ba.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Ya yi kama da abin da yake jin girma.
This is.	Wannan shine.
He definitely loves the project.	Babu shakka yana son aikin.
You.	Kai.
No matter how much you save, someone else earns money.	Komai nawa kuka ajiye, wani ya sami kuɗi.
And in no way is there anything new here.	Kuma a wata hanya babu wani sabon abu a nan.
But they are ready to go.	Amma sun shirya su tafi.
The material ran out.	Kayan ya gudu.
And it must be done quickly.	Kuma dole ne a yi sauri.
But he was wrong.	Amma ya yi kuskure.
You will understand.	Za ku gane.
Do not change it.	Kar ku canza shi.
I had a great time.	Na yi babban lokaci.
Things are not good there.	Abubuwa ba su da kyau a can.
But at the time he was not thinking very much.	Amma a lokacin bai kasance yana tunani sosai ba.
He knew he had made no mistake about it.	Ya san bai yi kuskure ba game da wannan.
You need to get out of there.	Kuna buƙatar fita daga wurin.
Tell me, tell me, tell me.	Ka so ni, ka so ni, ka so ni.
It's funny.	Yana da ban dariya.
Some of us have been changed.	An canza wasu daga cikin mu.
But it works well for me.	Amma yana yi min aiki lafiya.
Cold, and it can happen.	Sanyi, kuma zai iya faruwa.
But he tried to focus on something simple.	Amma ya yi ƙoƙari ya mai da hankali kan wani abu mai sauƙi.
And what is not so good.	Kuma abin da ba shi da kyau sosai.
I worked through.	Na yi aiki ta hanyar.
This may explain more relevant facts here.	Wannan na iya bayyana ƙarin abubuwan da suka dace a nan.
You see he is in trouble.	Ka ga yana cikin matsala.
It worked really well.	Yayi aiki sosai.
The good news is that they do.	Abin da ya dace shi ne cewa sun yi.
This, for me, is amazing food.	Wannan, a gare ni, abinci ne na ban mamaki.
And he failed.	Kuma ya kasa.
That has not changed.	Hakan bai canza ba.
It often works, so make a book early.	Sau da yawa yana aiki, don haka yi littafin da wuri.
Tell us your experiences.	Faɗa mana abubuwan da kuka samu.
The others did the same.	Haka sauran suka yi.
If you really are serious.	Idan da gaske kuke da gaske.
I get involved in that.	Ina shiga cikin hakan.
We will not have as much time as we hoped.	Ba za mu sami lokaci mai yawa kamar yadda muke fata ba.
How much more than me.	Yaya fiye da ni.
He didn't even go to school the previous day.	Ranar da ta gabata ma bai je makaranta ba.
I try to think of what he would like.	Ina ƙoƙarin tunanin abin da zai so.
Start small, see how you walk.	Fara kadan, duba yadda kuke tafiya.
He keeps giving me mistakes.	Yana ci gaba da ba ni kuskure.
We are still children.	Mu har yanzu yara ne.
But of course no one got it.	Amma ba shakka babu wanda ya samu.
The car broke down.	Motar nan ta shiga ciki.
And a lot of money is spent on travel.	Kuma ana kashe kuɗi da yawa don tafiya.
Can you save the book?	Za a iya ajiye littafin?
That touched me deeply.	Hakan ya taba ni sosai.
No sleep for anyone.	Babu barci ga kowa.
There is no thought in it.	Babu wani tunani a ciki.
We were able to repair the car without any problems.	Mun sami damar gyara motar ba tare da wata matsala ba.
The problem is that you need to know how to do it.	Matsalar ita ce kuna buƙatar sanin yadda ake yin shi.
It is good to do well.	Yana da kyau a yi kyau.
Certainly not tonight.	Lallai ba daren nan bane.
I don't want to forget it.	Ban so in manta da shi.
It has been raining for over a week.	An yi ruwan sama sama da mako guda.
I finally took some time to do it.	A ƙarshe na ɗauki ɗan lokaci don yin shi.
You are not there.	Ba ka can.
You must be logged in to post a comment.	Dole ne ku shiga don shiga.
And you don’t, either.	Kuma ba ku yi ba, haka ma.
It's a simple statement, and it's right.	Magana ce mai sauƙi, kuma daidai ce.
I saw what he could do.	Na ga abin da zai iya yi.
It is something completely new.	Wani sabon abu ne gaba ɗaya.
That should never happen again.	Bai kamata hakan ya sake faruwa ba.
His best for the event is.	Mafi kyawun sa don taron shine.
You are really, really scary.	Kai da gaske, abin ban tsoro ne.
No one is visible.	Babu kowa a gani.
They want to fight.	Suna son fada.
There is no doubt or uncertainty.	Babu shakka ko rashin tabbas.
You cannot change this.	Ba za ku iya canza wannan ba.
Not everyone will.	Ba kowa zai yi ba.
You may hate it.	Kuna iya ƙi shi.
If you drink this, you are dead.	Idan ka sha wannan, ka mutu.
I hope you are well.	Ina fatan kana lafiya.
I am not well known.	Ni ba a san ni sosai ba.
Bring him plenty of food.	Kawo masa abinci mai yawa.
The project will continue until next year.	Aikin zai ci gaba har zuwa shekara mai zuwa.
This way.	Ga hanya.
Sometimes it’s good.	Wani lokaci yana da kyau.
First, go ahead.	Na daya, ci gaba.
Tired and careless.	Gaji da rashin kula.
He will understand that.	Zai fahimci hakan.
Everything takes time.	Komai na bukatar lokaci.
Let me join now.	Bari in shiga yanzu.
Let's talk a little.	Mu yi magana kadan.
Not really, but it seems so.	Ba gaske ba, amma ga alama haka.
We go out there and kill the others.	Muna fita can mu kashe sauran su.
It is not so.	Ba haka ba ne.
A lot of reading is going on.	Ana ci gaba da karatu da yawa.
I think in the end she will not hate him here.	Ina tsammanin daga ƙarshe ba za ta ƙi shi a nan ba.
I can't just say.	Ba zan iya cewa kawai ba.
Time is up.	Lokacin ya kare.
He would not talk to me.	Ba zai yi min magana ba.
Maybe someone hit it.	Wataƙila wani ya buga shi.
Maybe someone can suggest the best.	Wataƙila wani zai iya ba da shawarar mafi kyau.
It was an interesting job.	Ya kasance aiki mai ban sha'awa.
Although this is nothing new.	Ko da yake hakan ba sabon abu ba ne.
One time, please!	Lokaci guda, don Allah!
I think home, see everyone, how it will feel.	Ina tunanin gida, ganin kowa, yadda zai ji.
Do not miss this opportunity.	Kar ku rasa wannan damar.
She does not lie.	Ba ta karya.
He got what he needed.	Ya samu abin da yake bukata.
It takes a lot of time.	Yana ɗaukar lokaci mai yawa.
It is something to look at.	Abu ne da za mu duba.
I was the last thing she ever saw.	Ni ne abu na ƙarshe da ta taɓa gani.
A good person to work with.	Kyakkyawan mutumin da za a yi aiki da shi.
I can't wait to play.	Ba zan iya jira in yi wasa ba.
It's hard, it's hard.	Yana da wuya, mai wuya.
We almost got it.	Mun kusa samun shi.
So whatever you think it looks like.	Don haka ko me kuke tunanin ya yi kama.
I learned something new today.	Na koyi sabon abu yau.
Only he here can see.	Shi kadai ne a nan ya iya gani.
He is dead, so he cannot go out.	Ya mutu, don haka ba zai iya fita ba.
It is not life.	Ba ita ce rayuwa ba.
We are not interested.	Ba mu da sha'awar.
But it is not a beautiful sight.	Amma ba kyakkyawan gani ba ne.
He too was not happy.	Shi ma bai yi dadi ba.
There was no way she could.	Babu yadda ta iya.
Of course it works.	Tabbas yana aiki.
Somehow it’s not as easy as you think.	Ko ta yaya ba shi da sauƙi kamar yadda kuke tunani.
You can leave us now.	Kuna iya barin mu a yanzu.
She learned to drink every day as she came.	Ta koyi shan kowace rana kamar yadda ya zo.
I have a problem with this.	Na sami matsala da wannan.
And so they sent.	Da haka suka aika.
He looks like a rich man.	Yana kama da mai kudi.
The rain here is unpredictable.	Ruwan sama a nan ba shi da tabbas.
You know it's true.	Kun san gaskiya ne.
He was afraid to fly.	Ya ji tsoron tashi.
Not on equipment.	Ba a kan kayan aiki ba.
I hope you will come to me soon.	Ina fatan za ku zo mini da wuri.
The sun was hot, and it was a little cold.	Rana ta yi zafi, kuma ya ɗan yi sanyi.
Go ahead, 'he said.	Ci gaba,' in ji shi.
So that makes sense.	Don haka hakan ya sa hankali.
Likewise.	Haka kuma.
Is anyone injured?	Akwai wanda ya ji rauni?
There is one problem, though.	Akwai matsala ɗaya, ko da yake.
Let me go.	Bari in tafi.
He started drinking a lot.	Ya fara sha da yawa.
There’s not much in it, but there’s something.	Babu yawa a ciki, amma akwai wani abu.
You know me.	Kun san ni.
About three times.	Kamar sau uku.
At first he knew to surprise.	Da farko ya san mamaki.
Food is the real problem.	Abinci shine ainihin matsalar.
I never told him.	Ban taba gaya masa ba.
It should not be difficult.	Bai kamata ya zama mai wahala ba.
What is easy for them will not be easy for us.	Abin da ke da sauƙi a gare su ba zai kasance mana da sauƙi haka ba.
We could not find out what happened.	Ba mu iya gano abin da ya faru ba.
It's safer.	Ya fi lafiya.
I'll check.	Zan duba.
Then I sat down and read.	Sai na zauna na karanta.
He alone is not in a hurry.	Shi kad'ai baya sauri.
Can't say much about the place.	Ba za a iya magana sosai game da wurin ba.
What he did was wrong.	Abin da ya yi bai dace ba.
It is one of.	Yana daga cikin .
Do not buy unused food.	Kada ku sayi abincin da ba a yi amfani da shi ba.
Sure, let me try that.	Tabbas, bari in gwada hakan.
So we work through this.	Don haka muna aiki ta wannan.
She was afraid of being alone.	Ta ji tsoron zama ita kadai.
I could not recognize him.	Ba zan iya gane shi ba.
They come almost every night.	Suna zuwa kusan kowane dare.
Above all, it cannot be bought.	Fiye da komai, ba za a iya siyan ta ba.
I don’t think he can make a lot of money from doing so.	Ba na jin zai iya samun kudi da yawa daga yin haka.
I’ve never done well in it.	Ban taba yin kyau a ciki ba.
And, the rest of us.	Kuma, sauran mu.
The meeting did not seem to be successful.	Da alama taron bai yi nasara ba.
We do not need your help.	Ba ma bukatar taimakon ku.
And it works really well.	Kuma yana aiki sosai.
I do not know how to tell you what happened.	Ban san yadda zan gaya muku abin da ya faru ba.
Maybe they did.	Wataƙila sun yi wannan.
It's not a good thing.	Ba abu ne mai kyau ba.
Change things up.	Canza abubuwa sama.
No one should be here.	Babu wanda ya isa ya kasance a nan.
It cannot go on like this.	Ba zai iya ci gaba kamar haka ba.
I walk when it is cold.	Ina tafiya lokacin sanyi.
The kids are still playing.	Yara har yanzu suna wasa.
You can drink it.	Kuna iya sha da shi.
The rain is like heat.	Ruwan sama kamar zafi ne.
Do this as much as you can.	Yi wannan yadda za ku iya.
The plan is ready.	An shirya shirin.
I thought we were going to get married.	Na dauka za mu yi aure.
Even then, it is not necessary.	Ko a lokacin, ba dole ba ne.
It is bigger than life.	Ya fi rayuwa girma.
Remember what he did for you.	Ka tuna abin da ya yi maka.
No one will ever have such an opportunity again.	Babu wanda zai sake samun dama irin wannan.
He lit a cigarette.	Ya kunna taba.
I want to know the big all.	Ina so in san babban duka.
But we are told that we will eventually leave.	Amma an gaya mana cewa za mu tashi daga ƙarshe.
But it seems that one has to think that this is possible.	Amma da alama dole ne wani ya yi tunanin hakan zai iya zama.
Only one failed there.	Daya kawai kasa can.
But I also made a mistake.	Amma kuma na yi kuskure.
No one is talking about.	Babu kowa game da.
But he needs you.	Amma yana bukatar ku.
He thought she was serious.	Ya dauka tana da gaske.
I want them released.	Ina so a sake su.
You are in a hurry.	Kuna da sauri.
The way they walk is something that should not be entered.	Yadda suke tafiya wani abu ne da ba za a shiga ba.
It appears to be closed.	Ya bayyana a rufe.
I said they were seriously injured.	Na ce sun ji rauni sosai.
No one enters or leaves.	Babu mai shiga ko fita.
It's very scary.	Yana da matukar ban tsoro.
And they have.	Kuma suna da.
Then she could love it.	Sai ta iya son shi.
But here, too, the truth is out of the way.	Amma a nan ma, gaskiya sun shiga hanya.
I feel like every song has one.	Ina jin kamar kowace waƙa tana da guda ɗaya.
No one ever really did.	Babu wanda ya taɓa yin gaske.
The last item was checked today.	An duba abu na ƙarshe a yau.
I couldn’t get the desire to put something down.	Na kasa samun sha'awar sanya wani abu.
I am very healthy.	Ina da lafiya sosai.
It is there, however.	Yana can, duk da haka.
How long.	Har yaushe.
But they are not talking about it now.	Amma ba yanzu suke magana akan hakan ba.
I did not expect it to last a week.	Ban yi tsammanin zai yi mako guda ba.
I saw this.	Na ga wannan.
I do it about twice a week.	Ina yin shi kamar sau biyu a mako.
I think he suffered a lot.	Ina jin ya sha wahala sosai.
This is a real problem.	Wannan matsala ce ta gaske.
No one is talking.	Ba wanda ke magana.
I did not hear anything from the others.	Ban ji komai daga sauran ba.
But the whole story failed.	Amma duk labarin ya kasa zama.
It is useless to run.	Babu amfani don gudu.
It's not about them growing fast.	Ba game da su girma da sauri ba.
I will not check.	Ba zan duba ba.
Nothing will happen.	Babu wani abu da zai faru.
She opened it for two things.	Ta bude ta ga abu biyu.
That happens a lot.	Wanda ke faruwa da yawa.
We saw both.	Mun ga duka biyu.
No one even knew he was there.	Ba wanda ma ya san yana wurin.
Use caution.	Yi amfani da hankali.
No one did that.	Babu wanda ya yi haka.
So come to your senses.	Don haka ku zo da hankali.
We know where you work.	Mun san inda kuke aiki.
Cover with plenty of food.	Rufe abinci mai yawa.
The first year we did that.	Shekara ta farko da muka yi haka.
He stopped drinking several years ago.	Ya daina sha shekaru da yawa da suka wuce.
But this game is amazing.	Amma wannan wasan ya ban mamaki.
Early still.	Da wuri har yanzu.
It can be interesting to you.	Yana iya zama mai ban sha'awa a gare ku.
All required equipment was provided.	An ba da duk kayan aikin da ake bukata.
He has no problem with girls.	Ba shi da matsala da 'yan mata.
She looks fine!	Ta duba lafiya!
You've got a hard head.	Kun sami kai mai wuya.
There has never been a single problem.	Ba a taɓa samun matsala ɗaya ba.
I know why you came.	Na san dalilin da ya sa kuka zo.
Let's do what we can.	Mu yi abin da muka samu.
However, going to work is a reality of life.	Duk da haka, zuwa aiki gaskiya ne na rayuwa.
Do not open it.	Kar a bude shi.
I don't think that happened this year.	Bana jin hakan ya faru a bana.
She goes on to say.	Ta ci gaba da cewa.
She lives nearby.	Tana zaune kusa da nan.
The happy one laughed.	Mai farin ciki yayi dariya.
Attempts were made again.	An sake yin ƙoƙari.
This is a game that has been won.	Wannan wasan da an yi nasara.
Not so, but something is happening.	Ba haka ba, amma wani abu yana faruwa.
So this would be a quick, easy fix.	Don haka wannan zai zama gyara mai sauri, mai sauƙi.
This is faster than driving.	Wannan ya fi tuƙi sauri.
Yes, they all know him very well.	Haka ne, duk sun san shi da kyau.
They just run, one by one.	Gudu kawai suke yi, daya bayan daya.
Maybe he is the only one.	Wataƙila shi kaɗai ne.
It is not lost on me.	Ba a rasa a kaina ba.
But the teacher was more interested.	Amma malamin ya fi sha'awar.
Not fast, but not slow.	Ba da sauri ba, amma ba a hankali ba.
Call it what you want it to be.	Ku kira shi abin da kuke so.
He quickly closed the door.	Da sauri ya rufe kofar.
I left the house and started walking.	Na bar gidan na fara tafiya.
This may take some time.	Wannan na iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci.
He had never seen such a dog.	Bai taba ganin irin wannan kare ba.
However it will not start flying.	Duk da haka ba zai fara tashi ba.
And we are running.	Kuma muna gudu.
He took great care.	Ya kula sosai.
Something else was there.	Wani abu kuma ya kasance a can.
It is a way of working.	Hanya ce ta aiki.
Just hear about it.	Kawai ji game da shi.
It is not enough.	Bai isa ba.
I could not find an answer.	Na kasa samun amsa.
Life is not about growth.	Rayuwa ba game da girma ba ne.
I could not read to her.	Na kasa karanta mata.
I am on my way now.	Ina kan hanya yanzu.
And now here.	Kuma yanzu a nan.
He began to think in pleasure.	Ya fara tunani cikin jin dadi.
He wanted to get over it.	Ya so ya samu kan hakan.
You are here.	Kuna nan.
Hope is something that keeps you going.	Fata wani abu ne da ke sa ku ci gaba.
There were no volunteers on the day.	A ranar ba a rasa masu aikin sa kai ba.
How to make it interesting.	Yadda za a sanya shi mai ban sha'awa.
This is a great development to accept.	Wannan babban ci gaba ne don yarda.
I like these.	Ina son waɗannan.
Selling the house.	Sayar da gidan.
Anything can happen.	Duk abin da zai iya faruwa.
There is no reason why it cannot be done for many things.	Babu dalilin da ba za a iya yi don abubuwa da yawa.
I do not want to be here.	Ba na son zama a nan.
Not true, though.	Ba gaskiya ba ne, ko da yake.
You look nice.	Kun yi kyau.
Please stay where you are.	Da fatan za a tsaya a inda kuke.
We need all the help we can get.	Muna bukatar duk taimakon da za mu iya samu.
And a lot of money, a lot.	Kuma kudi masu yawa, da yawa.
While this was not true in the past, now.	Duk da yake wannan ba gaskiya ba ne a da, yanzu.
Today he is not in school.	Yau ba ya makaranta.
This story is not true.	Wannan labarin ba gaskiya bane.
Surprisingly he died.	Abin mamaki ya mutu.
But she made it clear that she needed to do it alone.	Amma ta bayyana cewa tana bukatar yin hakan ita kaɗai.
But we are talking now.	Amma muna magana yanzu.
You can make this material.	Kuna iya yin wannan kayan.
I will need.	Zan bukata.
We were like.	Mun kasance kama.
He seems to be in a hurry to just get there.	Da alama yayi sauri don zuwa can kawai.
I feel busy.	Ina jin aiki.
Just look at yourself.	Kallon kan ka kawai.
After that, things get more complicated.	Bayan haka, abubuwa suna ƙara wahala.
No one wants !.	Ba wanda yake so!.
He heard, but did not understand.	Ya ji, amma bai gane ba.
Just keep going.	Ci gaba kawai.
He seems to enjoy seeing other women when he enjoys it.	Da alama yana jin daɗin ganin sauran mata lokacin da ya ji daɗi.
He reached the end of the road.	Ya kai karshen hanya.
I brought it.	na kawo shi.
He ate with him.	Ya ci abinci da shi.
It is.	Yana da.
Really, even something nearby.	Ko da gaske, ko da wani abu da ke kusa.
No one knows.	Babu wanda ya sani.
Although it may be so.	Ko da yake tana iya zama haka.
They look very much like humans.	Suna kama da mutane sosai.
But after a while, he grew up and even loved children.	Amma bayan wani lokaci, ya girma har ma yana son yara.
Has this happened in the past?	Shin wannan ya faru a baya?
But now it has begun.	Amma yanzu ya fara.
You can not change the past.	Ba za ku iya canza abin da ya gabata ba.
I don’t feel there are many who even come here.	Ba na jin akwai mutane da yawa da ko da suka zo nan.
He got pregnant.	Ya dauka ciki.
They did not do this.	Ba su yi wannan ba.
You have a lot otherwise.	Kuna da yawa in ba haka ba.
They make him look like a bow.	Suna yi masa kamar wani irin baka ne.
What a first day.	Me rana ta farko.
He could if he wanted to.	Zai iya idan ya so.
Then add more.	Sai kara kara.
If you don't feel right, don't go out there.	Idan ba ku ji daidai ba, kar ku fita can.
It will be written later.	Za a rubuta daga baya.
Maybe it was at some point.	Wataƙila ya kasance a wani lokaci.
Really good.	Da gaske yayi kyau.
And that was just up there.	Kuma hakan ya kasance a sama kawai.
The place will stand empty.	Wurin zai tsaya babu kowa.
It’s time to get this back on track.	Lokaci ya yi don dawo da wannan kan hanya.
Just fill out and send.	Cika kawai ka aika.
I never told you.	Ban taba gaya muku ba.
He smokes, of course.	Yana shan taba, ba shakka.
Hope you will be with us !.	Da fatan za ku kasance tare da mu!.
And maybe they won’t.	Kuma watakila ba za su yi ba.
I will not change.	Ba zan canza ba.
They can't get it much.	Ba za su iya samun shi da yawa ba.
She died there.	Ta mutu a wurin.
I don’t know, not really.	Ban sani ba, ba da gaske ba.
It's delicious and funny.	Yana da dadi da ban dariya.
And she is well prepared.	Kuma ta shirya sosai.
It looks like it was done well.	Ga alama an yi shi da kyau.
The problem is coming.	Matsala na zuwa.
Remember what he said.	Ka tuna abin da ya ce.
Tomorrow we will pay for it.	Ana gobe za mu biya ta.
I met them.	Na hadu da su.
I do that well.	Ina yin hakan da kyau.
I thought he could talk a little.	Na dauka zai iya yin magana kadan.
In many cases, that is fine.	Sau da yawa, hakan yana da kyau.
I'll be back there shortly.	Zan dawo can nan da ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Do not fix anything.	Kar a gyara komai.
I thought of that too.	Na yi tunanin wannan kuma.
But that does not help.	Amma hakan ba zai taimaka ba.
I have a strange problem.	Ina da matsala mai ban mamaki.
It was difficult for her.	Yayi mata wuya.
You may have already discovered this.	Wataƙila kun riga kun gano hakan.
No women, no children.	Ba mata, ba yara.
Make sure you try this if you get the chance.	Tabbatar kun gwada wannan idan kun sami dama.
Maybe he knows.	Wataƙila ya sani.
No one wants to call kids.	Babu wanda ke son yin kira ga yara.
Every little bit helps us do what we do.	Kowane dan kadan yana taimaka mana mu yi abin da muke yi.
Everyone who was there was there.	Duk wanda ya kasance kowa yana wurin.
He stopped and sat down.	Ya tsaya ya zauna.
I want to succeed.	Ina so in yi nasara.
Otherwise he will get nothing.	In ba haka ba ba zai sami komai ba.
There was no way he was going to catch him, but he did.	Babu yadda ya kamata ya kama shi, amma ya yi.
No one was in it.	Ba wanda ya kasance a ciki.
There is no right or wrong answer.	Babu amsa daidai ko kuskure.
Sleep well kids.	Barci lafiya yara.
Drink good coffee.	A sha kofi mai kyau.
I sat on my own carefully.	Na zauna da kaina a hankali.
We understood a little and lost it.	Mun fahimci kadan kuma muka rasa shi.
Please don't kill me.	Don Allah kar a kashe ni.
Smoking will no longer be allowed in the future.	Ba za a ƙara yarda da shan taba a nan gaba ba.
It just never got enough.	Kawai bai taba isa ba.
However more will come.	Duk da haka ƙarin zai zo.
You see what you want to see.	Kuna ganin abin da kuke son gani.
There is no waiting time, he said.	Babu lokacin jira, in ji shi.
But this is nothing.	Amma wannan ba komai ba ne.
And we should not do it.	Kuma bai kamata mu yi ba.
Let's go into the house, let's do the work.	Mu shiga gidan, mu yi aikin.
He knew he could not succeed.	Ya san ba zai iya yin nasara ba.
You made me very happy when you did.	Kun sanya ni farin ciki sosai lokacin da kuka yi.
Take the latter.	Ka dauka na karshen.
In the morning as usual.	Da safe kamar yadda aka saba.
You have to be careful how you handle these things.	Dole ne ku kula da yadda kuke ɗaukar waɗannan abubuwan.
I hope it is not you.	Ina fatan ba kai ba ne.
He loves to do things.	Yana son yin abubuwa.
That’s not all, however.	Wannan ba duka ba ne, duk da haka.
He said nothing at night.	Bai ce komai ba a daren.
I see what is happening to me.	Ina ganin abin da ke faruwa da ni.
Like this?	Kamar wannan?
I have never seen her do that.	Na taba ganin ta ta yi haka.
I will never see this thing again.	Ba zan taba ganin wannan abu ba.
That went right.	Wannan ya tafi daidai.
We cannot leave such a thing.	Ba za mu iya barin irin wannan ba.
I could not think of anything to write.	Ba zan iya tunanin wani abu da zan rubuta ba.
What they are doing is not as good as what they are doing.	Abin da suke yi bai kai abin da suke yi ba.
Only then can they fall asleep.	A lokacin ne za su iya yin barci.
So hope you enjoyed it.	Don haka da fatan kun ji daɗi.
See how tired she is.	Kalli yadda ta gaji.
We do not know.	Ba mu sani ba.
Now you can see exactly what you want to see.	Yanzu kuna iya ganin ainihin abin da kuke son gani.
And he could not see anything.	Kuma bai iya ganin komai ba.
If they can do that, they can do anything.	Idan za su iya yin hakan, za su iya yin komai.
This is amazing.	Wannan yana da ban mamaki.
She wanted to come back years before now.	Ta so ta dawo shekaru kafin yanzu.
They tell each other.	Suna gaya wa juna.
I hope to understand it.	Ina fatan in gane shi.
In fact, no one expected that to happen.	A gaskiya, babu wanda ya yi tsammanin hakan zai faru.
One woman is just crying.	Wata mata tana kuka kawai.
But not necessarily.	Amma ba lallai ba ne.
So getting involved in a career that she enjoys.	Don haka shiga ta cikin wani aiki da take jin daɗi.
Everyone was kind and helpful.	Kowa ya kasance mai kyau da taimako.
Only water.	Ruwa ne kawai.
You will never find it.	Ba za ka taba samun ta.
What happened happened.	Abin da ya faru ya faru.
Do me the wrong thing.	A yi min haka bai dace ba.
No one knows her.	Babu wanda ya san ta.
Yet.	Amma duk da haka.
As you can see.	Kamar yadda kuka gani.
I tried it too.	Na gwada shi ma.
We have no problem with thinking.	Ba mu da matsala da tunani.
I don't like this.	Ba na son wannan.
If she is not here, she is not anywhere.	Idan ba ta nan, ba ta ko ina.
If you know please help.	Idan kun sani don Allah a taimaka.
And he knows us.	Kuma ya san mu.
He wanted to go.	Ya so ya tafi.
I want to leave it.	Ina son in bar shi.
No one arrested him.	Babu wanda ya kama shi.
It makes sense.	Ya kawo hankali.
Sure they can hurt.	Tabbatar za su iya jin zafi.
But when you say you just feel like it.	Amma lokacin da ka ce kawai ka ji kamar shi.
I tried it on a little before you.	Na gwada shi a kan kaɗan kafin ku.
Put something on it, to fix it properly.	Sanya wani abu a kai, don gyara shi da kyau.
The room was full of people.	Dakin ya cika da mutane.
They were defeated.	An ci su.
I used to cry.	Na kan yi kuka.
Lots of great food.	Abinci mai yawa da yawa.
There is no need to be good, here.	Babu buƙatar zama mai kyau, a nan.
This is necessary.	Wannan ya zama dole.
He wanted a drink.	Ya so abin sha.
I'm sure there are a few.	Na tabbata tabbas akwai 'yan kaɗan.
No one was too worried.	Ba wanda ya damu sosai.
I enjoyed being home.	Na yi farin cikin zama gida.
No one knows where they came from.	Babu wanda ya san daga ina suka fito.
Leaving school and working and everything.	Barin makaranta da aiki da komai.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
She couldn’t enjoy anything.	Ba za ta iya jin daɗin komai ba.
Love it all.	Son shi duka.
That doesn't taste good.	Hakan ba dadi.
Of course I can see you are smart.	Tabbas zan iya ganin ku masu hankali ne.
They think this is going to happen.	Suna tunanin wannan za a yi tunani.
We hope you enjoy these.	Muna fatan za ku ji daɗin waɗannan.
But this is common.	Amma wannan na kowa ne.
To this day.	Har yau mana.
What he is doing now.	Abin da yake yi yanzu.
Many things have happened in the world since then.	Abubuwa da yawa sun faru a duniya tun lokacin.
We talked about it after the game.	Mun yi magana game da shi bayan wasan.
He drank a little.	Ya sha dan kadan.
Call it the Case of the Missing Kidney.	Kira shi a cikin rashin lafiya.
She worked through lunch.	Ta yi aiki ta hanyar abincin rana.
I have to go.	Dole na tafi.
I don’t even think he likes you.	Ban ma tunanin yana son ku ba.
We'll talk to you a little bit later.	Za mu yi magana da ku kadan kadan.
To continue from where he left off.	Don ci gaba daga inda ya tsaya.
She just thought.	Ta dan yi tunani.
For me, this is a good opportunity.	A gare ni, wannan dama ce mai kyau.
The players are accustomed to winning.	'Yan wasan sun saba cin nasara.
This is my favorite restaurant.	Wannan gidan abincin da na fi so.
He was.	Ya kasance.
Everyone is safe.	Kowa ya zauna lafiya.
Nothing came close to me.	Ba wani abu ne ya zo kusa da ni ba.
Nice host.	Yayi kyau mai gida.
That would be a problem.	Da ya zama matsala.
The car stopped.	Motar ta tsaya.
The weeping.	Da kuka.
He could not stay here.	Bai iya zama a nan ba.
She knows me very well.	Ta san ni sosai.
And if he's right, he's right.	Kuma idan ya yi gaskiya, yana kan daidai.
They still came.	Har yanzu sun zo.
He did not know how to do it.	Bai san yadda zai yi ba.
It was early, eleven thirty.	Da wuri ne, sha ɗaya da talatin.
I bought	na saya
Who brought us here and now.	Wanda ya kai mu nan da yanzu.
This leaves only one way.	Wannan ya bar hanya daya kawai.
I let myself go.	Na bar kaina na tafi.
She did not know it was happening.	Ba ta san ana haka ba.
But he is getting there.	Amma yana zuwa can.
He touched her a lot, no one felt as good as her.	Ya taba mata yawa, babu mai jin dadi kamar ta.
The work was very difficult.	Aikin ya kasance mai wahala sosai.
Do not be accustomed.	Kada a saba.
It can happen many times, only once, or it will never happen.	Yana iya faruwa sau da yawa, sau ɗaya kawai, ko kuma ba zai taɓa faruwa ba.
You have to play at home and on the road.	Dole ku yi wasa a gida da kan hanya.
Ask them where they heard it.	Ka tambaye su a ina suka ji shi.
They will not talk to him.	Ba za su yi magana da shi ba.
Of course, nothing can happen.	Tabbas, babu abin da zai iya faruwa.
I'll try it tomorrow.	Zan gwada gobe.
She had a similar experience at school.	Ta sami irin wannan abin a makaranta.
However, we can correct this as follows.	Duk da haka, za mu iya gyara wannan kamar haka.
We have.	Muna da .
Money is hard to come by.	Kudi ya yi wuya a samu.
I'll do it all over again though.	Zan sake yin shi duka ko da yake.
And we can.	Kuma za mu iya.
We will see how he feels and what he is trying to do.	Za mu ga yadda yake ji da abin da yake ƙoƙarin yi.
That would be interesting.	Da hakan ya kasance mai ban sha'awa.
He wanted to stop thinking.	Ya so ya daina tunani.
This is the next big project.	Wannan babban aiki ne na gaba.
I'm not feeling well.	Ba ni da lafiya.
Let's have dinner.	Mu ci abincin dare.
It's at a school.	A wata makaranta ne.
It could be the previous day, a week or a month.	Yana iya zama ranar da ta gabata, mako guda ko wata.
It's funny.	Yana da ban dariya.
Things are good.	Abubuwan da ke da kyau.
She starts crying now.	Ta fara kuka yanzu.
That doesn't bother me at all.	Wannan baya sanya min hankali ko kadan.
Content only to be purchased.	Abin ciki kawai da za a saya.
Probably nothing to say.	Wataƙila ba za a ce komai ba.
Watch what is happening there.	Kalli abin da ke faruwa a wurin a hankali.
Next, she sees a dog and wants to go.	A gaba, ta ga wani kare kuma tana son tafiya.
Do not change it.	Kada ku canza shi.
He did not eat or drink.	Bai ci ko sha ba.
Not all people are on the day.	Ba duka mutane ba ne a ranar.
What he wants from her and why.	Abin da yake so daga gare ta kuma me yasa.
The door is closed.	Kofar ta rufe.
But the doctor understood.	Amma likitan ya gane.
Not even here.	Ba ma a nan.
I think now.	Ina tunani yanzu.
You see, they, well.	Ka ga, su, da kyau.
He seemed to be very sad about this loss.	Ya zama kamar ya yi bakin ciki sosai da wannan rashin.
I will make a mistake.	Zan sami kuskure.
I would not be here if it were not for him.	Ba zan kasance a nan ba idan ba don shi ba.
This must be done.	Dole ne a yi haka.
No. First.	A'a na farko.
And it must be stopped.	Kuma dole ne a tsaya haka.
The work was.	Aikin ya kasance.
That's all.	Haka kawai.
There is nothing here.	Nan ba komai.
The first is not necessarily the best.	Na farko ba lallai ba ne mafi kyau.
Be who you are.	Kasance wanda kai.
There are so many things around.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa a kusa.
We had a great week.	Mun yi kyakkyawan mako mai kyau.
I'm finding things.	Ina gano abubuwa.
I think this is the time.	Ina tsammanin wannan shine lokacin.
The car stopped in the back of the car.	Motar ta tsaya a bayan motar.
No, no, not for me.	A'a, a'a, ba don ni ba.
And they know when he will be there.	Kuma sun san lokacin da zai kasance a wurin.
I think we can prove it later.	Ina tsammanin za mu iya tabbatar da hakan daga baya.
There is nothing in it.	Babu wani abu a ciki.
I remember a little from where we went, or even what we did.	Na tuna kadan daga inda muka je, ko ma abin da muka yi.
We are getting married.	Muna yin aure na gaske.
Some are coming to get food.	Wasu suna zuwa su sami abinci.
Go and get ready.	Ka je ka shirya.
‘The police blocked the road.	‘Yan sanda sun tare hanyar.
Are you here for work or for fun?	Kun zo nan don aiki ne ko don jin daɗi?
Everyone is fine.	Kowa yana lafiya.
You know each other very well.	Kun san juna sosai.
Surprisingly it is.	Abin mamaki ita ce.
We soon realized that the work had not been done.	Nan da nan muka gane cewa ba a yi aikin ba.
We went and we went.	Muka tafi mu tafi.
One would think they would start there but no.	Mutum zai yi tunanin za su fara can amma a'a.
Do this.	Shin wannan.
Surprisingly, however, she did not panic.	Abin mamaki ne, duk da haka, kada ta ji tsoro.
Not there.	Babu can.
I'm not ready.	Ban shirya ba.
I used to think of you a lot.	Na kasance ina tunanin ku da yawa.
He's doing well now.	Yana yin kyau yanzu.
But you heard what she said.	Amma kun ji abin da ta ce.
Every player enters it.	Kowane dan wasa yana shiga ta.
The person next to is smoking a lot.	Mutumin da ke kusa yana shan taba sosai.
Which, above all, explains why he came here.	Wanda, fiye da komai, ya bayyana dalilin da ya sa ya zo nan.
She has nothing there.	Ba ta da komai a wurin.
Of course he did great ground.	Tabbas ya yi babban kasa.
I don’t think about it.	Ba na tunani game da shi.
We just have to be human.	Kawai mu zama mutane.
He missed the first flight, caught the next one.	Ya rasa jirgin farko, ya kama na gaba.
You need to know how to enjoy talking to people.	Kuna buƙatar sanin yadda ake jin daɗin magana da mutane.
They make sense.	Suna yin hankali.
Inside and out, one.	A ciki da waje, daya.
I think it's good for everyone.	Ina ganin yana da kyau ga kowa.
He too will not return.	Shi ma ba zai dawo ba.
Let's name this place.	Bari mu sanya wa wannan wuri suna.
I'm not sad.	Ban yi bakin ciki ba.
I saw her talking to a man today.	Na ga tana magana da wani mutum yau.
Steel house	Gidan karfe
Everyone knows you can hurry.	Kowa ya san za ku iya sauri.
They are there for me.	Suna can gare ni.
No, that's not it.	A'a, ba wannan ba.
And that is what they did.	Kuma abin da suka yi ke nan.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Har yanzu ba a bayyana wanda zai yi ba.
And it just grew out of there.	Kuma kawai ya girma daga can.
We may never get this opportunity again.	Wataƙila ba za mu sake samun wannan damar ba.
They went beyond repair.	Sun wuce gyara.
But no one will.	Amma wani ba zai yi ba.
I think.	Ina ji.
She has a job.	Tana da aiki.
There is a lot to be said about this material.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa game da wannan kayan.
And you have one.	Kuma kana da daya.
I want to try it really hard.	Ina so in gwada shi sosai.
It just shows something new in itself.	Yana kawai nuna sabon abu a cikin kansa.
They say there is too much water.	Suka ce ruwa ya yi yawa.
This will help us to know what they know.	Hakan zai taimaka mana mu san abin da suka sani.
I tried to remember it.	Na yi ƙoƙari in tuna da shi.
She decided to look for a job.	Ta yanke shawarar neman aikin.
As they are.	Kamar yadda suke.
It will come anytime now.	Za ta zo nan kowane lokaci yanzu.
We can do anything.	Za mu iya yin wani abu.
Still no one came.	Har yanzu babu wanda ya zo.
You do not hear.	Ba ku ji ba.
Moreover, they have not made progress.	Haka kuma, ba su samu ci gaba ba.
So remove it.	Don haka cire shi.
But we had better go, because they are closer.	Amma gara mu je, saboda suna kusa.
It is part of being human.	Yana daga cikin zama mutum.
Thinking of something interesting is interesting.	Tunanin wani abu mai ban sha'awa yana da ban sha'awa.
I think somewhere a little out of the way with people.	Ina tunanin wani wuri kadan daga hanya da mutane.
This name alone speaks volumes.	Wannan sunan kadai yayi magana da yawa.
I am good to take care of the day.	Ina da kyau don kula da rana.
Not to show everything you do.	Ba don nuna duk abin da kuka yi ba.
Otherwise, it is not.	In ba haka ba, ba haka ba ne.
All is not lost, however.	Duk ba a rasa ba, duk da haka.
He did not know what she was saying.	Bai san me ta ce ba.
The second is even more surprisingly intelligent.	Na biyu ya ma fi ban mamaki mai hankali.
Dinner is being prepared.	Ana shirya abincin dare.
He immediately realized why.	Nan take ya gane dalilin haka ne.
Like nothing could do.	Kamar babu abin da zai iya yi.
But it was good.	Amma ya yi kyau.
Not so, though.	Ba haka ba ne, ko da yake.
But she seemed happy.	Amma ta yi kamar farin ciki.
You died here.	Ka mutu a nan.
We are a little tired.	Mun dan gaji.
Come on girls.	Ku zo mu 'yan mata.
Try them on the last day of each month.	Gwada su a ranar ƙarshe na kowane wata.
It's mine.	Yayi min.
I will not help you either.	Ni ma ba zan taimake ka ba.
This thing really didn’t get it.	Wannan abu da gaske bai samu ba.
He also apologized.	Ya kuma ba da hakuri.
Actually I didn’t feel any pain at all.	A gaskiya ban ji zafi gaba ɗaya ba.
Do this with the next thought.	Yi haka da tunani na gaba.
But he stayed in one place.	Amma ya zauna a wuri guda.
This is probably right.	Wannan tabbas yayi daidai.
So it turned out to be very interesting.	Don haka ya zama abu mai ban sha'awa sosai.
And he is a very passionate player.	Kuma shi mutum ne mai matukar son wasan.
It was necessary for me.	Ya zama dole a gare ni.
I couldn’t find any way to make it work.	Ba zan iya gano wata hanyar da zan sa ta yi aiki ba.
But they did not.	Amma ba su yi ba.
She came out and gave him the room.	Ta fito ta bashi dakin.
Let him rise.	Bari ya tashi.
So they never saw how real they were.	Don haka ba su taɓa ganin yadda suke da gaske ba.
But you are not really here.	Amma ba ku da gaske a nan.
But he ran away.	Amma ya gudu.
They know what to do.	Sun san abin da za su yi.
Everyone is in heaven.	Kowa ya kasance a sama.
Someone has to say something.	Dole ne wani ya ce wani abu.
They should have known better.	Lallai yakamata sun fi sani.
It was scary.	Ganin ya ban tsoro.
This is amazing.	Wannan yana da ban mamaki.
I never thought he would go.	Ban taba tunanin zai tafi ba.
He still hasn't killed me.	Har yanzu bai kashe ni ba.
Get into the next car slowly.	Shiga mota ta gaba a hankali.
I apologize to you.	Na yi hakuri da ku.
There are funny things.	Akwai abubuwan ban dariya.
We published it.	Muka buga shi.
And who are we thinking.	Kuma su wanene muke tunani.
It's time now.	Lokaci yayi yanzu.
He doesn't like that.	Ba ya son hakan.
How long did they think it could go on.	Har yaushe suka yi tunanin zai iya ci gaba.
The point here is uncertain.	Hankali a nan ba shi da tabbas.
No child to be placed.	Babu yaro da za a sanya.
And now, it’s happening at home.	Kuma yanzu, yana faruwa a gida.
Maybe they are.	Wataƙila su ne.
It will always be.	Zai kasance koyaushe.
Trying to use it.	Ƙoƙarin neman amfani da shi.
Wait more.	Jira ƙarin.
But no, he never made that decision.	Amma a'a, bai taba yin irin wannan shawarar ba.
Three times he almost killed her.	Sau uku ya kusa kashe ta.
He walks slowly looking down.	A hankali yake tafiya yana kallon kasa.
Today two things happened.	A yau abubuwa biyu ne suka faru.
I have a few.	Ina da 'yan kaɗan.
Not necessarily the only reason.	Ba dole ba ne kawai dalilin.
She loves people.	Ta so mutane.
He was to work together.	Ya kasance don yin aiki tare.
It was a good day and we had to do something.	Rana ce mai kyau kuma dole ne mu yi wani abu.
Give, and it shall be given unto you;	Ku ba, za a ba ku.
They did not.	Ba su yi ba.
Finally, the station was not in the house.	A ƙarshe, tashar ba ta kasance a cikin gida ba.
No more calls.	Babu sauran kira.
We started paying attention.	Mun fara ba da hankali.
She is talking to someone.	Tana magana da wani.
There is only one problem, the person who wants her dead.	Matsala daya ce kawai, mutumin da yake son ta mutu.
I know this is true.	Na san wannan gaskiya ne.
I know for sure they didn't.	Na san tabbas ba su yi ba.
He went to help them.	Ya je ya taimake su.
My head has never been right since.	Kai na bai taba yin daidai ba tun.
This is not a man.	Wannan ba mutum ba ne.
I don’t wait until things stop working.	Ba na jira har sai abubuwa sun daina aiki.
He would recommend coming to check out this place.	Zai ba da shawarar zuwa don duba wannan wuri.
The water rose.	Ruwan ya tashi.
This is almost the way to do it.	Wannan ita ce kusan hanyar yin hakan.
He admits he made a mistake.	Ya yarda cewa yayi kuskure.
Nor do they speak as before.	Haka kuma ba su yi magana kamar da.
Sure, you would, but it can't be helped.	Tabbas, haka za ku yi, amma ba za a iya taimakon hakan ba.
Whenever it is one though, it is not.	Duk lokacin da yake daya ko da yake, ba haka ba.
The winners agreed.	Masu nasara sun yarda.
But everything is.	Amma komai yana da.
He has already prepared them.	Ya riga ya shirya su.
I enjoy that.	Ina jin daɗin hakan.
We can, they say.	Za mu iya, in ji su.
He wants to fight.	Yana neman fada.
But he will not tell us what happened.    	Amma ba zai gaya mana abin da ya faru ba.    
I hate that.	Na ƙi wannan.
We take the day.	Muna ɗaukar ranar.
This has been accepted for many years.	An yarda da wannan shekaru masu yawa.
I can't make it home for lunch.	Ba zan iya sanya shi gida don abincin rana ba.
She should never have agreed.	Bai kamata ta taba yarda ba.
I do not know what you are trying to do.	Ban san abin da kuke ƙoƙarin yi ba.
You feel like this person.	Kuna jin kamar wannan mutumin.
I know they are coming to me.	Na san suna zuwa gare ni.
Now it will rise.	Yanzu zai tashi.
This is not what they want.	Wannan ba abin da suke so ba ne.
She knew it had to be raining.	Ta san dole a yi ruwa.
The way to it.	Hanyar zuwa gare ta.
She wants to see a movie.	Tana son ganin fim.
We agreed to meet for a drink.	Mun yarda mu hadu a sha.
He did not get up and was not injured.	Bai tashi ba kuma bai ji rauni ba.
Nothing came in, nothing was found.	Babu wani abu da ya shiga, babu abin da ya samu.
Absolutely, no answer.	Babu shakka, babu amsa.
I can't let that happen again.	Ba zan iya barin abin ya sake faruwa ba.
She is very beautiful.	Tana da kyau sosai.
For dinner maybe.	Don abincin dare watakila.
She doesn't need to say anything again.	Bata bukatar ta sake cewa komai.
The water ran for a while.	Ruwa ya gudu na ɗan lokaci.
Someone gave me a hand!	Wani ya ba ni hannu!
It is hot, but it must be.	Yana da zafi, amma dole.
It just has to be.	Dole ne kawai ya kasance.
It will be a great development.	Zai zama babban ci gaba.
She gets it and there is no mistake.	Tana samun shi kuma babu kuskure.
They need to talk.	Suna bukatar yin magana.
A few times a day.	Sau kaɗan a rana.
This all works really well.	Wannan duk yana aiki sosai.
You need to give people a chance.	Kuna buƙatar ba mutane dama.
They seem to be very uncomfortable.	Suna kama da rashin jin daɗi sosai.
I made money	Na yi kudi
I know how to do it.	Na san yadda zan yi.
If anyone can do this.	Idan wani zai iya yin wannan.
Money doesn't matter, she told me.	Kudi babu ruwan su, ta ce da ni.
The rest of the year is good though.	Sauran shekara yana da kyau ko da yake.
Let's keep it up.	Mu ci gaba da shi.
In fact, we know very little about him.	A gaskiya, mun san kadan game da shi.
Fill in the blanks.	Cika abubuwan da ba komai.
When women succeed, children succeed.	Lokacin da mata suka yi nasara, yara sun yi nasara.
In fact, he did not.	A gaskiya ma, bai yi ba.
I got up early and got up.	Na tashi da wuri na tashi.
He got back on track quickly, though.	Ya dawo kan hanya da sauri, ko da yake.
I love it, honestly.	Ina son shi, a gaskiya.
The player's name is below.	Sunan dan wasan yana kasa.
I want you to stay here.	Ina so ku zauna a nan.
I think no one can.	Ina tsammanin babu wanda zai iya.
He knows many things.	Ya san abubuwa da yawa.
Now it is mine.	Yanzu ya zama nawa.
This person has no future.	Wannan mutumin da ba shi da gaba.
For on what went well.	Gama a kan abin da ya tafi da kyau.
Absent.	Ba ya nan.
He did it himself, and it was easy, and simple.	Ya sake yin kansa, kuma yana da sauƙi, kuma mai sauƙi.
I need one	Ina bukata daya
It grows fast.	Yana girma da sauri.
This is not acceptable.	Wannan ba abin yarda ba ne.
This is not the kind of place one can be.	Wannan ba shine irin wurin da mutum zai iya zama ba.
That person is everything to me.	Wannan mutumin shi ne komai na.
I will go there but not often.	Zan je can amma ba sau da yawa ba.
She is beautiful.	Ta yi kyau.
This is not the end of the story.	Wannan ba shine karshen labarin ba.
I agree with him.	Na yarda da shi.
We will be happy to help.	Za mu yi farin cikin taimaka.
I want to see interest	Ina so in ga sha'awa
But there is.	Amma akwai.
I should be in night work.	Ya kamata in kasance cikin aikin dare.
Every day now you will hear from them.	Kowace rana yanzu za ku ji daga gare su.
Simply, nothing happens.	Kawai, babu abin da ke faruwa.
Now back to work.	Yanzu koma aiki.
I'm very sorry.	Na yi kasa hakuri.
Everything seems to work.	Komai yayi kamar yayi aiki.
If anything, it’s more comfortable.	Idan wani abu, ya fi jin dadi.
I can't do it myself.	Ba zan iya yi da kaina ba.
She is still homeless.	Har yanzu bata gida.
He started it.	Ya fara shi.
We told him to sit down and eat with us.	Muka ce masa ya zauna ya ci tare da mu.
Not bad when everyone thinks you will lose.	Ba mummunan ba lokacin da kowa ya yi tsammanin za ku rasa.
But of course you will learn something.	Amma tabbas za ku koyi wani abu.
Remove skin gently.	Cire fata a hankali.
There is no way to do it.	Babu yadda za a yi.
I know some have.	Na san wasu sun yi.
He did not answer.	Bai amsa ba.
I am not asking you to marry me.	Ba ina neman ka aure ni ba.
But they do not want to go out.	Amma ba sa son fita.
However, something went wrong.	Duk da haka, wani abu ya kasance ba daidai ba.
This is the third time here.	Wannan shi ne karo na uku a nan.
It is a hot day.	Rana ce mai zafi.
It will grow.	Zai girma.
She does not like him either.	Ita ma ba ta son shi.
You can only cut these.	Kuna iya yanke waɗannan kawai.
She is.	Ita ce.
This is real.	Wannan na gaske ne.
And I like it.	Kuma na so shi.
Send us to work with others.	Aika mu iya aiki da sauran.
It may still happen.	Yana iya har yanzu faruwa.
It is difficult but necessary.	Yana da wuya amma ya zama dole.
You’re going to win every game.	Kuna je cin nasara kowane wasa.
I will tell you the truth.	Zan gaya muku gaskiya.
It is something we do or do not do.	Abu ne da muke yi ko yi.
So, you see.	Don haka, kun gani.
I used to talk about these things.	Na saba yin magana akan waɗannan abubuwan.
We all need it.	Mu duka muna bukata.
He does nothing else.	Ba ya yin komai in ba haka ba.
I'm coming here.	Ina zuwa nan.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Na tabbata kun san menene hakan.
You must read it carefully.	Dole ne ku karanta da gaske.
So, we have to work.	Saboda haka, dole ne mu yi aiki.
No problem, he said.	Ba matsala, in ji shi.
I was at home at night.	Na kasance a gida a daren.
She was in every one.	Ta kasance a cikin kowane daya.
But there is no fear.	Amma babu tsoro.
I heard him call me.	Na ji ya kira ni.
They will do well.	Za su yi kyau.
So he will not play.	Don haka ba zai yi wasa ba.
I will never be her.	Ba zan taba zama ita ba.
And say it again.	Kuma ka sake fada.
You can kill someone, but not just because you do not like it.	Kuna iya kashe wani, amma ba don kawai ba ku son wani ba.
This is a time to relax.	Wannan lokaci ne don jin daɗi.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
Come buy, come buy.	Zo saya, zo saya.
But if he leaves now everything is over.	Amma idan ya tafi yanzu komai ya wuce.
The taste has slightly changed.	Dadi ya ɗan canza.
Stick to things.	Tsaya akan abubuwa.
In humans, they cannot see.	A cikin mutane, ba su iya gani ba.
It is best to turn it on safely.	Zai fi kyau a kunna shi lafiya.
It's hot watching.	Yana da zafi kallon.
We will look at two things.	Za mu duba abubuwa biyu.
He immediately explained that this was a big mistake.	Nan da nan ya bayyana cewa wannan babban kuskure ne.
It's just beautiful.	Yana da kyau kawai.
Do not assume this will not help.	Kar a ɗauka wannan ba zai taimaka ba.
I think we were.	Ina tsammanin mun kasance.
But that would be interesting.	Amma da hakan ya kasance mai ban sha'awa.
He didn’t stand out more than anyone.	Bai tsaya fiye da kowa ba.
There is rain in everything, and everything is cold.	Akwai ruwan sama a cikin komai, kuma komai yayi sanyi.
She could not know he would come to this.	Ba za ta iya sanin zai zo ga wannan ba.
When he didn’t care.	Lokacin da bai kula ba.
He filled his stomach.	Ya cika masa ciki.
It makes him happy he can do anything.	Ya sa shi yarda zai iya yin komai.
I should have done more than that.	Ya kamata in yi fiye da waɗannan.
I was afraid to go.	Na ji tsoron tafiya.
I will go with you when we pass.	Zan tafi tare da ku idan mun wuce.
She decided to tell.	Ta yanke shawarar gaya.
The person can see that.	Mutumin yana iya ganin haka.
You have never lived.	Ba ka taba rayuwa ba.
So scary.	Don haka tsoro.
They are old.	Suna da shekaru.
I'm back on time.	Na dawo akan lokaci.
You can go ahead, if you want.	Kuna iya ci gaba, idan kuna so.
Just get used to it.	Kawai ka saba da shi.
She could not believe she was worried about that.	Ta kasa yarda ta damu da hakan.
It's hard though.	Yana da wuya ko da yake.
If you want to travel, you must do the same.	Idan kuna son tafiya, za ku yi hakan ma.
At my workplace.	A wurin aiki na.
Almost everyone does.	Kusan kowa yayi.
things are fine there.	abubuwa suna lafiya a can.
Of course, this time they will.	Tabbas, wannan lokacin za su yi.
I could not believe her when she replied.	Na kasa yarda da ita lokacin da ta amsa.
I forgot this.	Na manta wannan.
You better be on board.	Da kyau ku kasance a kan jirgin.
You keep seeing what’s happening on the game.	Ana ci gaba da ganin abin da ke faruwa kan wasan.
Where there is no money and no future.	Inda babu kudi kuma babu gaba.
Absolutely.	Tabbas yayi.
That made her nervous.	Hakan yayi mata hankali.
He saw the best in people.	Ya ga mafi kyau a cikin mutane.
At first, it was hard to read.	Da farko, yana da wuya a karanta.
But try before you buy.	Amma gwada kafin ka saya.
I want this to stop.	Ina son wannan ya tsaya.
However, for me, it did.	Duk da haka, a gare ni, ya yi.
I hope you are well.	Ina jin ku lafiya.
I could not understand anything.	Na kasa gane komai.
These two children should be looked at, too.	Ya kamata a duba waɗannan yara biyu, su ma.
Don't you like them?	Ba ku son su?

That way, don’t overdo it.	Ta wannan hanyar, kada ku kara tunani.
But we get to do what we want.	Amma muna samun yin abin da muke so.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
I can't wait to try one.	Ba zan iya jira don gwada daya ba.
However, it is not so simple.	Duk da haka, ba haka ba ne mai sauƙi.
This is not the day.	Ba wannan ranar ba ce.
But sometimes later.	Amma wani lokacin daga baya.
It really is.	Yana da gaske.
Fix it later, but write it down.	Gyara shi daga baya, amma a rubuta shi.
I think he can do that.	Ina tsammanin zai iya yin hakan.
But he could not tell her the truth.	Amma ya kasa gaya mata gaskiya.
She died earlier.	Ta mutu a baya.
Continue for as long as you can.	Ci gaba har tsawon lokacin da za ku iya.
The way to the thing.	Hanyar zuwa abu.
I worked.	Na yi aiki.
No one knew he would die in another year.	Babu wanda ya san zai mutu a cikin wata shekara.
Anything good takes time.	Duk wani abu mai kyau yana ɗaukar lokaci.
What they discovered surprised them.	Abin da suka gano ya ba su mamaki.
The house is here.	Gidan yana nan.
Including people.	Ciki har da mutane.
That is exactly what happened.	Lallai abin da ya faru ke nan.
Now it may be time.	Yanzu yana iya zama lokacin.
It's huge.	Yana da girma.
Kids are in school, you know.	Yara suna makaranta, ka sani.
However, there is work.	Duk da haka, akwai aiki.
She left for a while.	Ta tafi sai d'an lokaci.
They have to reach that.	Dole ne su kai ga hakan.
The size was huge.	Girma ya kasance mai girma.
I am pregnant.	Na ciki ne a gare ni.
No one is going to sleep tonight after what he sees.	Ba wanda zai yi barci yau da dare bayan abin da ya gani.
It can do that with people, too.	Yana iya yin haka da mutane, kuma.
I was just happy to be done with it.	Na yi farin ciki kawai da na gama da shi.
I could not bring myself to check it out.	Ban iya kawo kaina don duba ta ba.
So we're not looking at that anymore.	Don haka ba ma kallon wannan kuma.
He was injured.	Ya ji rauni.
It does not seem so.	Da alama ba haka bane.
But few people know.	Amma mutane kaɗan ne suka sani.
It works like a call retrieval function only.	Yana aiki kamar aikin dawo da kira kawai.
All but three.	Duk sai uku.
It is the end of work.	Karshen aiki ne.
I feel so broken.	Ina jin haka karya.
What do you think is the problem?	Me ake ganin shine matsalar?
They let it happen every night.	Sun bar shi ya faru kowane dare.
What is needed.	Abin da ake bukata.
I knew he would not do it.	Na san ba zai yi ba.
It's hard though.	Yana da wuya ko da yake.
We think, we feel, the world shows us.	Muna tunani, muna ji, duniya ta nuna mana.
Over the years.	A cikin shekaru.
Some I do not and just send.	Wasu na a'a kuma kawai aika.
She started this.	Ta fara wannan.
I have not heard yet.	Ban ji ba tukuna.
But don't worry about it now.	Amma kar ka damu da hakan a yanzu.
Another mistake.	Wani kuskure.
She is afraid to fly.	Tana tsoron tashi.
She comes almost all the time.	Ta zo kusan kowane lokaci.
But that did not make her happy.	Amma hakan bai yi mata dadi ba.
It has another name.	Yana da wani suna.
To write a song, one must have good intentions.	Don rubuta waƙa, dole ne mutum ya kasance yana da kyakkyawan tunani.
God is not hard.	Allah ba mai wuya ba ne.
And they are obsessed with work.	Kuma sun damu da aiki.
I went at the time.	Na tafi a lokacin.
The door is open.	An bude kofar.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
I can't get hurt.	Ba zan iya samun rauni ba.
So much food is wasted.	Ana bata abinci da yawa haka.
Every place will do.	Kowane wuri zai yi.
You need the help of people.	Kuna buƙatar taimakon mutane.
He committed suicide.	Ya kashe kansa.
You do everything right.	Kuna yin duk abin da ya kamata.
They like to drink on the weekends.	Suna son sha a karshen mako.
I like talking to people.	Ina son magana da mutane.
He was right, as usual.	Ya yi gaskiya, kamar yadda ya saba.
I know how it is.	Na san yadda abin yake.
She certainly did not ask for it.	Lallai ba ita ce ta nemi hakan ba.
So she started to cry.	Haka ta fara kuka.
Do not read this until you see the movie.	Kada ku karanta wannan har sai kun ga fim ɗin.
Go to him.	Je zuwa gare shi.
Not after all that time.	Ba bayan duk wannan lokacin ba.
We have to figure out how to do it.	Dole ne mu gano yadda za mu yi.
We have good players.	Muna da 'yan wasa masu kyau.
Fear of the night.	Tsoron dare.
You need to be together.	Kuna buƙatar zama tare.
I will not be there.	Ba zan kasance a wurin ba.
Explain what we did and will do.	Bayyana abin da muka yi kuma za mu yi.
But you can do the right thing here.	Amma kuna iya yin abin da ya dace a nan.
It's closed.	Ya rufe.
I have seen it many times.	Na gani sau da yawa.
I am seeking my release.	Ina neman a sake ni.
Or he will continue to walk.	Ko kuma zai ci gaba da tafiya.
And that's it.	Kuma shi ke nan.
Other than that, go.	Ban da wannan, ku tafi.
It's very interesting.	Yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
There are some who want to talk to him.	Akwai wasu da suke son magana da shi.
He wanted to live without me.	Ya so rayuwa ba tare da ni ba.
Nothing.	Ba komai.
It was fun and funny.	Tana da daɗi da ban dariya.
He wanted to get pregnant.	Ya so ba da ciki.
People are working.	Mutane suna aiki.
And she waited, she waited, nothing happened.	Ita kuma ta jira, ta jira, babu abin da ya faru.
So there is no wedding dress.	Don haka babu rigar aure.
If anything, they want to change what you want.	Idan wani abu, suna so su canza abin da kuke so.
I thought of you immediately.	Na yi tunanin ku nan da nan.
Then the work began.	Daga nan aka fara aikin.
And what they were.	Kuma abin da suka kasance.
They have to pay for this.	Su biya wannan.
They have to do this, they can't do that.	Dole ne su yi wannan, ba za su iya yin hakan ba.
You lied about that.	Kun yi karya game da hakan.
They don't like me here.	Ba sa so ni a nan.
They used to stay, but they stopped.	Sun kasance suna zama, amma sun daina.
Everyone thought the job would be someone else's problem.	Kowa yayi tsammanin aikin zai zama matsalar wani.
But let's see what happens in real life.	Amma bari mu ga abin da ke faruwa a rayuwa ta gaske.
He is still here.	Har yanzu yana nan.
A difficult time.	Lokaci mai wahala.
They need to work together.	Suna bukatar yin aiki tare.
Tested several times.	An gwada sau da yawa.
Lots of money going up every day.	Kudi da yawa ke tashi kowace rana.
I do not want to go.	Ban so in tafi.
I knew it would.	Da na san zai yi.
He has been dead for three months.	Ya mutu wata uku kenan.
I looked into them.	Na duba cikin su.
I used my head.	Na yi amfani da kai na.
The house was simple but comfortable.	Gidan ya kasance mai sauƙi amma dadi.
There is no way we can be so happy.	Babu yadda za mu yi farin ciki haka.
It is not known why he is so interested in it.	Ba a san dalilin da ya sa yake da sha'awar ta haka ba.
He is a man.	Mutumin ne.
He raised his head to see who was calling him.	Ya daga kai dan ganin wanda ya kira shi.
Whatever she did.	Duk abin da ta yi.
He proved to be a great player.	Ya tabbatar da zama babban dan wasa.
Let's see if we can figure it out.	Bari mu ga ko za mu iya yin wannan aiki.
I do not have to know anything.	Ba sai na san wani abu ba.
They did it well.	Sun yi hakan da kyau.
I have not found the reason yet.	Ban sami dalilin da ya sa ba tukuna.
It fits in wonderfully.	Ya dace da ban mamaki.
Hopefully they caught up.	Da fatan sun kama.
But he did not forget.	Amma bai manta ba.
He continues to make progress but is slowly making progress.	Ya ci gaba da samun ci gaba amma yana samun ci gaba a hankali.
He will prepare it.	Zai shirya shi.
Real time.	Lokacin gaskiya.
How long has it been like.	Tun yaushe ya kasance kamar.
This feels amazing.	Wannan yana jin ban mamaki.
Don't wait, work now.	Kar a jira, yi aiki yanzu.
It looks a little weird.	Ya yi kama da ɗan ban mamaki.
But that does not change things.	Amma wannan baya canza abubuwa.
I left before something bad happened.	Na tafi kafin wani mummunan abu ya faru.
But that is the case.	Amma haka abin ya kasance.
I will apply for the job.	Zan nemi aikin.
It shows very good things.	Ya nuna abubuwa masu kyau sosai.
He can make himself do this.	Zai iya sa kansa yayi wannan.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
He played great though.	Ya yi babban wasa ko da yake.
If only it would start.	Idan kawai zai fara.
And it gave me hope.	Kuma ya ba ni fata.
I can recommend one for work.	Zan iya ba da shawarar ɗaya don aiki.
Time does so.	Lokaci yayi haka.
They can leave.	Za su iya barin.
All you need to do is go there.	Duk abin da kuke buƙatar yi shi ne ku je can.
You are here.	Kuna nan.
It has never happened to him before.	Bai taba faruwa gare shi ba a da.
She was no longer human.	Ba ta kasance mutum ba kuma.
I read some things that will help me to progress.	Na karanta wasu abubuwa da za su taimake ni in ci gaba.
But she does not see.	Amma ita ba ta gani.
But not the rest.	Amma ba sauran ba.
We are there for dinner.	Muna can don abincin dare.
There is more work ahead.	Akwai sauran aiki a gaba.
This person looks like a problem.	Wannan mutumin yana kama da matsala.
The location was symbolic and appropriate.	Wurin ya kasance na alama kuma ya dace.
I have time to think about it.	Ina da lokacin tunani game da shi.
This seems to make sense.	Wannan da alama yana da hankali.
Of course you go about it wrong.	Tabbas kuna tafiya game da shi ba daidai ba.
It's amazing to run with it.	Yana da ban mamaki don gudu tare da shi.
It started to rain.	Aka fara ruwan sama.
He was too talkative.	Ya wuce magana.
We do not want to lose it.	Ba mu son rasa shi ba.
It took over a year !.	Ya ɗauki tsawon shekara guda!.
But they did not come, so to speak, right next door.	Amma ba su zo ba, don haka a ce, daidai da gaba.
I did not hear anything.	Ban ji komai ba.
I must remember it was not about me.	Dole ne in tuna ba game da ni ba ne.
If this was your wish, he would do the same.	Idan wannan fata ne, zai yi irin wannan abu.
She was so good about it.	Ta yi kyau sosai game da shi.
He didn't find anyone.	Bai sami kowa ba.
He got this right.	Ya samu wannan daidai.
He must study further.	Dole ne ya kara karatu.
And you can get it.	Kuma za ku iya samun shi.
And it is very exciting.	Kuma abin farin ciki ne sosai.
Just make sure you tell him it's okay.	Kawai ka tabbata ka gaya masa yana da kyau.
Water will not work.	Ruwa ba zai yi aiki ba.
I would never have told anyone about it.	Da ban taɓa gaya wa kowa game da shi ba.
I checked to make sure he was asleep, and no.	Na duba don tabbatar da cewa yana barci, kuma ba.
We have no such doubts.	Ba mu da irin wannan shakka.
We did a little bit.	Mun yi kadan kadan.
And you turn it on.	Kuma kun kunna.
There was just a good feeling.	Akwai wani kyakkyawan ji kawai.
I stopped using them and did not advise anyone.	Na daina amfani da su kuma ban ba kowa shawarar su ba.
Last night I didn't care about anything anymore.	A daren jiya ban damu da komai ba kuma.
If you want to know.	Idan kuna son sani.
Let's not say.	Kada mu ce.
This is the first day.	Wannan ita ce rana ta farko.
However, it worked once.	Duk da haka, ya yi aiki sau ɗaya.
You just live.	Kuna rayuwa ne kawai.
Good reading.	Kyakkyawan karatu.
It does a good job.	Yana da aiki mai kyau.
And nothing can be gained from it.	Kuma babu wani abu da za a iya samu daga gare ta.
Not in any way, or in any way.	Ba ta kowace hanya ba, ko ta kowace hanya.
Together, we will take care of the children.	Tare, za mu kula da yara.
It's a movie night.	Daren fim ne.
How many of us have reached out to each other?	Mu nawa ne suka kai wa juna?
It is not something like that.	Ba wani abu ba ne kamar haka.
We will do this next week.	Za mu yi wannan mako mai zuwa.
I have to get out of here right now.	Dole ne in fita daga nan yanzu.
Hope you found something you like.	Fata ku sami wani abu da kuke so.
I wondered if they would die?	Na yi tunanin ko za su mutu?
These belong to other people.	Waɗannan na sauran mutane ne.
I got caught at the time.	Na samu kama a lokacin.
You don't have time, life proves it.	Ba ku da lokaci, rayuwa ta tabbatar da haka.
It was about being useful.	Ya kasance game da zama mai amfani.
I enjoy a lot of things.	Ina jin daɗin abubuwa da yawa.
None other than women.	Ba kowa ba sai mata.
We come here every year.	Muna zuwa nan kowace shekara.
No one can do anything.	Babu wanda ya iya yin komai.
We won't do it, but they will assume we will.	Ba za mu yi ba, amma za su ɗauka za mu yi.
But we can feel it coming.	Amma muna iya jin yana zuwa.
Seriously, he finally stopped.	Da gaske, a ƙarshe ya tsaya.
For the first time, it appeared to me.	A karo na farko, ya bayyana a gare ni.
We don't take money.	Ba mu ɗauki kuɗi ba.
I don't mind, looking for her.	Ban damu ba, neman ta.
That could not happen.	Hakan bai iya faruwa ba.
And there was a man in the room.	Kuma akwai wani mutum a cikin dakin.
I think you really caught this.	Ina tsammanin kun kama wannan sosai.
I took it quickly.	Na dauka da sauri.
He immediately learned something.	Nan da nan ya koyi wani abu.
She apologized.	Ta bashi hakuri.
That's what we know best.	Abin da muka fi sani kenan.
I've seen this look before, too.	Na ga wannan kallon a baya, kuma.
But there is no progress.	Amma babu wani ci gaba.
She has to work.	Dole ta yi aiki.
This made him even happier.	Hakan ya kara masa farin ciki.
That's it.	Wannan shine abin.
He knew he had not tried very hard.	Ya san ba lallai ne ya yi ƙoƙari sosai ba.
Maybe I don't have it right.	Wataƙila ba ni da shi daidai.
This book is a good read.	Wannan littafin ya yi kyau karatu.
Call now and try it for us !.	Kira yanzu kuma gwada mana!.
But she has been without him for a long time.	Amma ta dade ba tare da shi ba.
He waited for an answer, but could not.	Ya jira amsa, amma bai samu ba.
You let that happen.	Kun bar hakan ta faru.
However, no one is right about everything.	Duk da haka, babu wanda ya dace game da komai.
If it works.	Idan yana aiki.
They do not really like each other.	Ba sa son juna sosai.
There were others who surprised me.	Akwai wasu da suka bani mamaki.
I'm really growing up.	Lallai ina girma.
Call here, first thing in the morning.	Kira nan, abu na farko da safe.
I know it's good here.	Na san yana da kyau a nan.
But she began to think so.	Amma ta fara tunanin hakan.
This in the end though.	Wannan a karshen ko da yake.
He came.	Ya zo.
He really looks like a good, good man.	Da gaske yana kama da mutum mai kyau, mai kyau.
And it will not be.	Kuma ba zai kasance ba.
Let me die, that's it.	Bari in mutu, shi ke nan.
God is good.	Allah ta yi kyau.
She sat down.	Ta zauna.
You will find much more from this book if you do.	Za ku sami ƙarin yawa daga wannan littafin idan kun yi.
He is convinced of that.	Ya tabbata a kan haka.
Nor does she want to.	Haka kuma bata so.
It's too hot now.	Akwai zafi da yawa yanzu.
I can let myself in.	Zan iya barin kaina in shiga.
You never know when it will hit.	Ba ku taɓa sanin lokacin da zai buga ba.
She did not know how to get here.	Ba ta san yadda za ta zo nan ba.
It is enough for three people.	Ya isa ga mutane uku.
You did not do it to me.	Ba ka yi min ba.
For me you will not go in and you will.	Don ni kuma ba za ku shiga ciki ba kuma za ku.
He loves you all very much.	Yana son ku duka sosai.
Here, nothing can touch me.	A nan, babu abin da zai iya taɓa ni.
Or lack thereof.	Ko rashin haka.
It was amazing.	Ya kasance abin ban mamaki.
Have a day with him.	Yi rana da shi.
But it is not, and it is not.	Amma ba haka bane, kuma ba haka bane.
I forgot the bow.	Na manta baka.
He was there last night.	Yana nan a daren jiya.
He was there that day.	Yana can ranar.
This really helped.	Wannan ya taimaka sosai.
And we got what we paid for.	Kuma mun sami abin da muka biya.
I didn't see anything.	Ban ga komai ba.
And he grew up.	Kuma ya girma.
We wrote about it.	Mun rubuta game da shi.
Everything is fine.	Komai daidai ne.
I'm sure you understand.	Na tabbata kun gane.
I know what he wants.	Na san abin da yake so.
Stay out of trouble.	Ka tsaya daga wahala.
And we don't have much.	Kuma ba mu da yawa.
Leave us safe.	Ka bar mu lafiya.
He himself did well.	Shi kansa ya yi kyau.
Only use it when you are not feeling well.	Yi amfani da shi kawai lokacin da ba ku da lafiya.
It’s fun to have the tools to work on it.	Yana jin daɗin samun kayan aiki don yin aiki a kai.
Tell me the truth.	Faɗa min gaskiya gaskiya.
I doubt though.	Ina shakka ko da yake.
There is room for them.	Akwai wuri gare su.
Who said the book was inappropriate?	Wanene ya ce littafin bai dace ba?
I think they will like it.	Ina tsammanin za su so shi.
Excuse me for that.	A sake bani hakuri akan hakan.
No one told her what to do or where to go.	Babu wanda ya gaya mata abin da za ta yi ko inda za ta kasance.
It was hard for him, and she did not know why.	Ta yi masa wuya, kuma ba ta san dalilin ba.
Now he is not a child.	Yanzu shi ba yaro bane.
It looks like a mistake.	Yana kama da kuskure.
There is a lot of fear.	Akwai tsoro da yawa.
Fill me up.	Kun fi ni.
I'm very smart.	Ina da hankali sosai.
I see no way out of it.	Ban ga wata hanya daga gare ta ba.
It doesn't matter how.	Ba komai ta yaya.
It's an exciting game.	Wasa ne mai ban sha'awa.
I am sick of it.	Ina rashin lafiya da shi.
Too much, maybe too much.	Ya yi yawa, watakila da yawa.
And it is.	Kuma shi ne.
This is the method described below.	Wannan ita ce hanyar da aka bayyana a kasa.
It's not safe to be around me.	Ba shi da lafiya zama a kusa da ni.
Turn off the water.	Kashe ruwan.
And a little bit.	Kuma kadan .
We can bring that back.	Za mu iya dawo da hakan.
But wait, you say.	Amma jira, ka ce.
We do not give you anything.	Ba mu ba ku komai.
That doesn't matter.	Hakan ba komai.
Maybe they can't think of anything better to do.	Wataƙila ba za su iya tunanin wani abu mafi kyau da za su yi ba.
It's hard to say.	Yana da wuya a ce.
And never do that again.	Kuma kada ku sake yin wannan.
Keep fighting.	Ci gaba da fada.
He did not know anything wrong.	Bai san wani abu ba daidai ba.
Even back to back.	Ko da baya baya.
Everything was up to the individual.	Komai ya kasance kawai ga mutumin.
I think he left me.	Ina tsammanin ya bar ni.
And all by train.	Kuma duk ta jirgin kasa.
It can not be him.	Ba zai iya zama shi ba.
Out of time.	Ya fita daga lokaci.
I know exactly what she did.	Na san ainihin abin da ta yi.
They seem to have left me.	Da alama sun bar ni.
Try it !.	Gwada shi!.
I do not understand what the problem is.	Ban gane menene matsalar ba.
I let them take it.	Na bar su su dauka.
It’s not even my closest call.	Ba ma kira na kusa ba ne.
The food is really good and it’s plentiful.	Abincin yana da kyau sosai kuma yana da yawa.
It's good, but it's not that good.	Yana da kyau, amma ba wannan mai kyau ba.
But here there is no way out.	Amma a nan babu wata hanya ta komai.
Can anyone help please?	Akwai wanda zai iya taimaka don Allah?.
You are very tired.	Kun gaji sosai.
But he is the same person he is today.	Amma shi mutum daya ne da yake a yau.
I feel pain for him in some way, though.	Ina jin zafi a gare shi a wata hanya, ko da yake.
Everything happened slowly.	Komai ya faru a hankali.
She is.	Ita ce.
Take care of yourself.	Kula da kanku.
I can't drink.	Ba zan iya sha ba.
I'm more comfortable.	Na fi jin daɗi.
Everyone looked the other way.	Kowa ya kalli wata hanya.
Whatever he does.	Duk abin da yake yi.
After that she will be brought to them without children.	Bayan haka za a zo mata ba tare da yara ba.
In fact, only once in a while is it human.	A gaskiya, sau ɗaya a lokaci guda kawai mutum ne.
It's good to come.	Yana da kyau ka zo.
But even a child can think.	Amma ko da yaro yana iya tunani.
No one heard him, and no one cared.	Babu wanda ya ji shi, kuma babu wanda ya damu.
And now.	Yanzu kuma.
No, he did not kill anyone.	A'a, bai kashe kowa ba.
Get out of there.	Fita daga can.
That's what she said.	Ta haka ta ce.
Don’t ask how he got there though.	Kada ka tambayi yadda ya isa can ko da yake.
Feeling good, too.	Jin yana da daɗi, kuma.
But no one would believe her.	Amma ba wanda zai yarda da ita.
To do what?	Don yin me?
Use them.	Yi amfani da su.
I can be real myself now.	Zan iya zama ainihin kaina a yanzu.
We can't stay here.	Ba za mu iya zama a nan ba.
Do not give up.	Kar a ba da kai.
And drink every day.	Kuma ku sha kowace rana.
But it is more than that.	Amma ya fi haka.
We finished eating.	Mun gama cin abinci.
I have never been married.	Ban taba yin aure ba.
In fact none of the above.	A gaskiya babu ɗaya daga cikin abubuwan da ke sama.

Maybe he was right.	Wataƙila ya yi gaskiya.
She is very sad.	Ta yi bakin ciki sosai.
I do not go to school.	Ba na zuwa makaranta.
They are better than us.	Sun fi mu.
And he didn't care.	Kuma bai damu ba.
I started talking.	Na fara magana.
They look like that.	Suna kama da haka.
We like the event.	Muna son taron.
We are not healthy.	Ba mu da lafiya.
It feels like home.	Ji yayi kamar gida.
Of course, it did not work.	Tabbas, bai yi aiki ba.
As it were.	Kamar yadda ya kasance.
He is not a role model.	Ba abin koyi ba ne.
Now give me a name.	Yanzu a ba ni suna.
Let's see what happens here.	Bari mu ga abin da ke cikin nan.
This has not been easy.	Wannan bai kasance mai sauƙi ba.
She will never be there again.	Ba za ta sake zuwa wurin ba.
To get there.	Don isa can.
I said it.	Na ce da shi.
He just wants to die.	Sai kawai yana so ya mutu.
She feels good about that.	Ta ji dadi game da wannan.
They have to find a way.	Dole ne su nemi wata hanya.
A lot of thinking and reading.	Yawan tunani da karatu.
And the food was available, just as always.	Kuma abincin ya samu, daidai da kowane lokaci.
Just my thing.	Kawai irin abu na.
Or, it should be so.	Ko, ya kamata ya zama haka.
It hurts too.	Hakan ma yayi zafi.
There is no reason for me to stop here.	Ba abin da zai sa in tsaya a nan.
It's not like they just stood there and watched.	Ba kamar sun tsaya suna kallon abin da ke faruwa ba.
The work made it difficult.	Aikin ya ba shi wahala.
It kills him.	Yana kashe shi.
Just not immediately.	Kawai ba nan da nan ba.
We will go outside.	Za mu fita waje.
You read last night.	Ka yi karatu a daren jiya.
Let's do it right.	Mu yi daidai.
It also costs money.	Hakan ma yana kashe kuɗi.
We will do anything for each other.	Za mu yi wa juna komai.
Still it worked.	Duk da haka ya yi aiki.
No, she did not hear from him.	A'a, ba ta ji daga gare ta ba.
Everything said to her may be true.	Duk abubuwan da aka fada mata na iya zama gaskiya.
It is best to do it immediately since it needs to be done.	Mafi kyau a yi shi nan da nan tun lokacin da ake buƙatar yin shi.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane.
Don’t say you didn’t.	Kar ku ce ba ku yi ba.
Remove the water.	Cire ruwa.
His usual game.	Wasan da ya saba yi.
Tell me when you are done.	Fada min idan kun gama.
And sleep late in the morning.	Kuma barci a makara da safe.
At first it worked fine.	Da farko yana aiki lafiya.
So get this.	Don haka ku sami wannan.
I can hear now.	Zan iya ji yanzu.
Police are searching for the killer.	‘Yan sanda na neman wanda ya kashe shi.
She's a little nice.	Ta dan yi kyau.
And it will be.	Kuma shi ne zai kasance.
It's hard, but it happens.	Yana da wuya, amma yana faruwa.
I knew he would get up.	Na san zai tashi.
But nothing.	Amma ba komai.
Just close.	Kusa kawai.
For not being able to give it.	Don rashin iya ba da ita.
There is nothing he can do.	Babu wani abu da zai iya yi.
We are left with the problem of what to do.	An bar mu da matsalar abin da za mu yi.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
But they need money.	Amma suna buƙatar kuɗi.
The world he knows is somewhere above it.	Duniya da ya sani tana wani wuri sama da shi.
A lot has changed this year.	Abubuwa da yawa sun canza a wannan shekara.
He just felt put in there.	Ya dan ji an sa shi a wurin.
It should have grown by now.	Kamata ya yi ya girma zuwa yanzu.
Or what it looks like.	Ko abin da ya zama kamar haka.
You are so beautiful.	Kun yi kyau sosai.
I can't go on like this.	Ba zan iya ci gaba haka ba.
Did you enjoy the meal?	Shin kun ji daɗin abincin?
She is sure now.	Ta tabbata yanzu.
He did not wait for an answer.	Bai jira amsa ba.
She still loves you.	Har yanzu tana son ku.
Two people died after being on the ground.	Mutane biyu sun mutu bayan sun kasance a kasa.
Something wonderful.	Wani abu mai ban mamaki.
People want to look like me.	Mutane suna so su yi kama da ni.
I should not cry.	Kada in yi kuka.
From the police, not her.	Daga 'yan sanda, ba ta su ba.
Maybe they happen faster this year.	Wataƙila suna faruwa cikin sauri a wannan shekara.
I said it was not good.	Na ce ba shi da kyau.
Do not buy.	Kada ku saya.
They were not made for that.	Ba a yi su don haka ba.
They are four.	Ba mu bane.
It has to pass, somehow.	Dole ne ya wuce, ko ta yaya.
She was honest and knew.	Ta yi gaskiya kuma ya sani.
I want to be able to touch it.	Ina so in iya taba shi.
We have to make sure we find the right one.	Dole ne mu tabbatar da samun wanda ya dace.
Either way, it would be a problem if anyone knew.	Ko ta yaya, zai zama matsala idan wani ya sani.
They do not need money.	Ba su buƙatar kuɗi.
It will take some time before the water returns.	Zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci kafin ruwan ya koma.
And yet you do not buy.	Kuma duk da haka ba ku saya ba.
I know the fear.	Na san tsoro.
They are the same people.	Mutane daya ne.
One only has to know how to do it well.	Dole ne kawai mutum ya san yadda ake yin shi da kyau.
But do.	Amma yi.
One will win and the other will lose.	Wani zai yi nasara wani kuma zai yi rashin nasara.
The man is a driver.	Mutumin yana da tuƙi.
You can check these out here.	Kuna iya duba waɗannan a nan.
But this never happened.	Amma wannan bai taba faruwa ba.
And no matter how she does it, nothing is better.	Kuma ko ta yaya za ta yi, babu abin da ya fi kyau.
I think he doesn't want to tell me.	Ina tsammanin baya son gaya mani.
I have no doubt whatsoever.	Ba ni da shakka ko menene.
You can sleep, if you want.	Kuna iya kwana, idan kuna so.
She stopped walking.	Ta daina tafiya.
It feels good.	Yana da kyau ji.
Tom was not there in person.	Tom bai kasance a wurin da mutum ba.
As such	Saboda haka
They paid me to do it.	Sun biya ni in yi.
It will show more tomorrow.	Zai nuna ƙarin gobe.
They get things done.	Suna samun abubuwa.
I do not have time to do this now.	Ba ni da lokacin yin wannan yanzu.
We know what they are up to.	Mun san abin da suke ciki.
Maybe this is what you want.	Wataƙila wannan shine abin da kuke so.
No one knows much about it.	Babu wanda ya san da yawa game da shi.
I used to be	Na kasance
It was exactly what they needed.	Ya zama daidai abin da suke bukata.
They went out together.	Suka fita tare.
Buy whatever you want.	Sayi duk abin da kuke so.
I knew him from the beginning.	Na san shi tun farko.
It's just like a game.	Kamar wani wasa ne kawai.
But we are not going to go yet.	Amma ba za mu tafi ba tukuna.
She thought about many things.	Ta yi tunani a kan abubuwa da yawa.
He came, as always, back to me.	Ya zo, kamar kullum, ya koma gare ni.
I joined right.	Na shiga daidai.
They look so comfortable.	Suna kama da jin dadi sosai.
You have to.	Ka yi dole.
They say they hear things like that all the time.	Sun ce suna jin abubuwa kamar haka kullum.
They want that.	Suna son haka.
Go with me.	Ku tafi tare da ni.
It may take a while.	Yana iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
But he is not ready to quit.	Amma bai shirya ya daina ba.
They are afraid that he will tell people what he knows about them.	Suna tsoron ya gaya wa mutane abin da ya sani game da su.
Then I stopped myself.	Sai na tsaya kaina.
It seems genuine.	Da alama da gaske.
Work in progress for some time now.	Ana ci gaba da aiki na ɗan lokaci yanzu.
So it will definitely work.	Don haka tabbas zai yi aiki.
They went to sleep.	Sun tafi barci.
It is not something we do to fill time.	Ba abu ne da muke yi don cika lokaci ba.
All this stuff is playing in the house.	Duk wannan kayan yana wasa a cikin gidan.
I will do anything to help you people, no matter what.	Zan yi wani abu don taimaka muku mutane, komai.
But until you apologize to her.	Amma har sai ka yi hakuri da ita.
Much like the owner.	Da yawa kamar mai shi.
Sorry to hear that.	Yi hakuri da jin wannan.
I will have time for this.	Zan sami lokaci don wannan.
There is no need to do so as it appears.	Babu bukatar yin haka da ya bayyana.
I like this.	Ina son wannan.
After a while	Bayan ɗan lokaci kaɗan
It can be a day or two.	Zai iya zama kwana ɗaya ko biyu.
The man looked familiar.	Mutumin ya duba saba.
I do not know what people think or feel.	Ban san abin da mutane ke tunani ko ji ba.
I never knew anyone by that name.	Ban taba sanin kowa da wannan sunan ba.
Do not cover from this.	Kar a rufe daga wannan.
They got in the car.	Suka shiga mota.
I will never do it.	Ba zan taba yin sa ba.
I'll do it later.	Zan yi shi a gaba.
It was a wonderful night though.	Dare ne mai ban mamaki duk da haka.
We don’t get hot at night or when we’re not home.	Ba mu yin zafi da dare ko lokacin da ba mu gida.
It was then that he realized something strange.	A lokacin ne ya fahimci wani abu mai ban mamaki.
You can talk to him.	Kuna iya magana da shi.
I was there at the time.	Ina can a lokacin.
You can talk to me.	Kuna iya magana da ni.
Be careful what you want, they say.	Yi hankali da abin da kuke so, in ji su.
All this, of course, is true.	Duk wannan, ba shakka, gaskiya ne.
There is one thing to do.	Akwai abu daya da za a yi.
Is it cold today?	Yau yayi sanyi ko?
That is what the police will do.	Abin da 'yan sanda za su yi ke nan.
She is amazing.	Tana da ban mamaki.
Please be called upon to arrive safely.	Da fatan za a kira ku isa wani wuri lafiya.
Hope you like it.	Da fatan za ku so shi.
I'm waiting for you.	Ina jiran ku.
I did well because it was good.	Na yi kyau saboda ya yi kyau.
In the game.	A cikin wasa.
They know you will come here.	Sun san za ku zo wurin nan.
I don't think you told me everything he said.	Bana tsammanin kun gaya mani komai da ya ce.
Where are we then?	Ina muke lokacin.
It is not always easy.	Ba koyaushe yana da sauƙi ba.
They didn’t play very well.	Ba su yi wasa sosai ba.
I am in need.	Ina cikin bukata.
I will not come again.	Ban sake zuwa ba.
Progress at this point has been slow.	Ci gaba a wannan gaba ya kasance a hankali.
Next, check the main closing of the house.	Na gaba, duba babban rufe gidan.
Some people do not like what is happening.	Wasu mutane ba sa jin daɗin abin da ke faruwa.
I have to run.	Dole in gudu.
Not just inside and out.	Ba kawai ciki da waje ba.
He is no longer a child.	Shi ba yaro ba ne kuma.
I have a chance.	Ina da wata dama.
I will eventually die.	Zan mutu a ƙarshe.
The last sentence looks like this.	Magana ta ƙarshe tana kama da haka.
Like someone who will help.	Kamar wanda zai taimaka.
Just pay attention.	Kula kawai.
Let me be.	Bari in kasance.
Maybe I can leave at any time.	Wataƙila zan iya barin kowane lokaci.
At the time I did not know he was wrong.	A lokacin ban san cewa yayi kuskure ba.
There is another world.	Akwai wani na duniya.
Now everything is fine.	Yanzu komai ya yi kyau.
I will not waste time.	Ba zan bata lokaci ba.
It has never happened or since.	Ba a taba faruwa ba ko tun daga lokacin.
They thought.	Sun yi tunani.
He wanted to go home.	Ya so ya koma gida.
I think it's really good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau sosai.
I feel people want to be honest.	Ina jin mutane suna son yin gaskiya.
That will never be enough.	Wannan ba zai taba isa ba.
He would never talk about the past.	Ba zai taba yin magana a kan abin da ya gabata ba.
It has become the best way to travel.	Ya zama mafi kyawun hanyar tafiya.
The one who is not there did it.	Wanda ba ya nan ya yi shi.
The room is also nice.	Dakin ma yayi kyau.
He couldn't help it here, he realized.	Bai iya taimaka masa a nan ba, ya gane.
What to say.	Abin da za ta ce.
You will get from them.	Za ku samu daga gare su.
And there are a lot of people who want you to do it.	Kuma akwai mutane da yawa da suke son ku yi shi.
But stay tonight.	Amma ku tsaya yau da dare.
This is amazing to me.	Wannan yana da ban mamaki a gare ni.
He was amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
And this time we are trying to do the same thing.	Kuma a wannan lokacin muna ƙoƙarin yin abu ɗaya.
Nothing rose.	Babu wani abu da ya tashi.
Nothing can be written.	Ba za a iya rubuta komai ba.
It’s one of those things that happens.	Yana daga cikin abubuwan da ke faruwa.
We have more to do.	Muna da fiye da haka da za mu yi.
However, they probably won't.	Duk da haka, da alama ba za su yi ba.
However, this does not happen.	Duk da haka, wannan ba ya faruwa.
Just wait, please, for me.	Jira kawai, don Allah, a gare ni.
So they spoke.	Haka suka yi magana.
Hardly the work takes a lot of time.	Da wuya aikin yana da lokaci da yawa.
Way out.	Hanyar fita.
Everything is fighting.	Komai fada ne.
Or you can.	Ko kuna iya.
We can even make a movie and put it here.	Muna iya ma yin fim ɗin mu sanya shi a nan.
Remember them, everyone.	Ka tuna da su, kowa da kowa.
They were very nice and nice.	Sun kasance masu kyau da kyau.
We were really surprised.	Mun yi mamaki sosai.
Great player of all time.	Babban dan wasa na kowane lokaci.
Do not return to your ship.	Kar ku koma jirgin ku.
He did it for himself.	Ya yi wa kansa.
I need to reach my one.	Ina bukata in kai ga daya nawa.
it's me	Ni ne
And over and over, and over.	Kuma a kan da kuma a kan, kuma a kan.
I need to make it happen.	Ina bukata in sa ya faru.
If not, you better not do it.	Idan ba haka ba, da kyau kar a yi.
And it's always good.	Kuma ko da yaushe yana da kyau.
It became a problem later for me.	Ya zama matsala daga baya a gare ni.
I was, however, in a lot of heat to think a lot.	Na kasance, duk da haka, cikin zafi mai yawa don yin tunani sosai.
He killed them all.	Ya kashe su duka.
Of course, you must come tomorrow too.	Tabbas, dole ne ku zo gobe ma.
They said there would be a sign.	Suka ce za a yi alama.
It would be great.	Zai yi kyau sosai.
They enter.	Suna shiga.
So far everything is working fine.	Ya zuwa yanzu komai ya yi aiki daidai.
I work part-time too.	Ina aiki da lokaci kuma.
I hope it hurts.	Ina fatan ya yi zafi.
I can't bring myself to touch it.	Ba zan iya kawo kaina in taba shi ba.
I did not get it.	ban samu ba.
But you do not know.	Amma ba ku sani ba.
I will get this game for sure.	Zan sami wannan wasan tabbas.
I want to help you.	Ina so in taimake ku.
You have a lot.	Kuna da yawa.
You can't wait.	Ba za ku iya jira ba.
Don't worry about what.	Kada ku damu da menene.
I have so much to tell you.	Ina da abubuwa da yawa da zan gaya muku.
That would be the right thing to do.	Wannan zai zama abin da ya dace a yi.
I am with you now, at this time.	Ina tare da ku a yanzu, a wannan lokacin.
Now I give it a go in everything.	Yanzu na ba shi hanya a cikin komai.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Wannan abu ya tabbata.
They left after a while.	Sun tafi bayan wani lokaci.
Obviously, the problem is twofold.	Babu shakka, matsalar sau biyu ce.
We are leaving the ship.	Muna barin jirgin.
No one has ever read them.	Ba wanda ya taɓa karanta su.
She is not inferior to anything.	Ba ta kasa da komai ba.
If you sell too much, you make too much.	Idan ka sayar da yawa, ka yi yawa.
He spoke to the women.	Ya yi magana da mata.
I have always been interested in this.	A koyaushe ina sha'awar hakan.
I wouldn’t expect much from you.	Ba zan yi tsammanin da yawa daga gare ku ba.
But maybe it’s no more interesting than that.	Amma watakila ba shi da ban sha'awa fiye da haka.
She should never have brought him here.	Bai kamata ta taba kawo shi nan ba.
And now someone has come to fulfill it.	Kuma yanzu wani ya zo ya cika.
I was wrong, but it was backwards.	Na yi kuskure, amma a baya ne.
I didn’t care about the time.	Ban damu da lokacin ba.
It shows you care, that you want.	Yana nuna ku kula, cewa kuna so.
I don't have time for myself.	Ba ni da lokacin kaina.
Maybe that happened to all of us.	Wataƙila hakan ya faru da mu duka.
You say so.	Kun ce haka.
Hear what you see.	Ji da kuke gani.
I did not see this.	Ban ga wannan ba.
I don't care who you send.	Ban damu da wanda ka aika ba.
Do you want to stay?	Kuna so ya zauna?
No one cared.	Babu wanda ya damu da shi.
That's the plan.	Ko shirin kenan.
It tasted good to eat.	Ya ji dadi ana cin abinci.
The name of this game is correct.	Sunan wannan wasan daidai.
Get out, go.	Ya fita, ku tafi.
Some are older than others.	Wasu shekaru sun fi wasu.
They are good.	Suna zama da kyau.
Good health to everyone!	Kyakkyawan lafiya ga kowa da kowa!
We don't care.	Ba mu damu da hakan ba.
He caught us all.	Ya kama mu duka.
It's very sad.	Yana da matukar bakin ciki gaske.
I care	Ina kula
Both or not.	Duka ko babu.
It still feels closed.	Har yanzu ji yayi a rufe.
The call is amazing.	Kira ni ban mamaki.
It is not good to sleep tired.	Ba shi da kyau barci ya gaji.
Every game is close but still.	Kowane wasa yana kusa amma har yanzu.
It is a boat.	Jirgin ruwa ne.
He is coming to buy us a house.	Yana zuwa ya saya mana gidan.
Please check now.	Da fatan za a duba yanzu.
Something must change.	Dole ne wani abu ya canza.
Maybe she'll like it too.	Wataƙila ma za ta so shi.
He thought he was going to die.	Ya yi tsammanin zai mutu.
But there was something she answered.	Amma akwai wani abu da ta amsa.
Can you tell me how to reach the station?	Za a iya gaya mani yadda zan isa tashar?
Not talked for a while.	Ba a yi magana ba na ɗan lokaci.
You will do whatever you want somehow.	Za ku yi abin da kuke so ko ta yaya.
That made me stop crying.	Hakan ya sa na daina kuka.
He made mistakes after mistakes, and everyone laughed at him.	Ya yi kuskure bayan kuskure, kuma kowa ya yi masa dariya.
I will write the article.	Zan rubuta labarin.
I really agree.	Na yarda da gaske.
It feels right.	Ya ji daidai.
It's late.	Lokaci ya wuce.
Like, despite it.	Kamar, duk da shi.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a bayyana abin da ya faru bayan wannan ba.
I will tell her now but she will not hear me.	Zan gaya mata yanzu amma ba za ta ji ni ba.
You can use both.	Kuna iya amfani da duka biyu.
And so they see.	Kuma haka suke gani.
It was a nice place to come out.	Wuri ne mai kyau ya fito.
You are you.	Kai ne kai.
She has to be told the truth.	Sai an fada mata gaskiya.
That is not right.	Hakan bai yi daidai ba.
No one will think you have arrived.	Babu wanda zai yi tunanin kun isa.
Help may be available.	Ana iya samun taimako.
I enjoyed them, personally.	Na yi farin ciki da su, da kaina.
No one can tell him what to do.	Babu wanda zai iya gaya masa abin da zai yi.
All the work was done and it was successful.	An yi duk aikin kuma an yi nasara.
He knows your name.	Ya san sunan ku.
Everyone will want you to go.	Kowa zai so ku tafi.
First in three years.	Na farko a cikin shekaru uku.
I can enjoy a great life.	Zan iya amfani da rayuwa mai girma.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
We are in one of these now.	Muna cikin ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan yanzu.
However, sorry for the article.	Duk da haka, yi hakuri da labarin.
I am tired	Na gaji
You want to do that, fine with me.	Kuna so ku yi haka, lafiya tare da ni.
Maybe he could talk to her for another night.	Wataƙila zai iya magana da ita zuwa wani dare.
So, he decided to commit suicide.	Don haka, ya yanke shawarar kashe kansa.
But before you go, let me tell you something.	Amma kafin ku tafi, bari in gaya muku wani abu.
We know we are good.	Mun san muna da kyau.
If it still has any.	Idan har yanzu yana da wani.
In order not to be weak.	Don kada ya zama mai rauni.
I think they wrote it.	Ina tsammanin sun rubuta shi.
It's there.	Yana can.
Then began to see.	Daga nan aka fara gani.
I have to cover for you.	Dole ne in rufe muku.
Someone lied to her.	Wani yayi mata karya.
What you need do not worry.	Abin da kuke buƙatar kada ku damu.
Some time has passed.	Wani lokaci ya wuce.
She also brought me homework.	Ita ma ta kawo min aikin gida.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
It's not as good as you think.	Ba shi da kyau kamar yadda kuke tunani.
I'm sure it shouldn't.	Na tabbata bai kamata ba.
It is difficult to explain, but it would not feel right.	Yana da wuya a bayyana, amma da ba zai ji daidai ba.
I would have.	Da na.
And it is not the first.	Kuma ba shi ne na farko ba.
But they know.	Amma sun sani.
There is no drinking water.	Babu ruwan sha.
And this is her place.	Kuma wannan wurin ta.
These are real people.	Waɗannan mutane ne na gaske.
You can find this on me.	Kuna iya samun wannan a kaina.
We should not take anything for granted.	Bai kamata mu dauki komai da wasa ba.
You should go and ask them.	Ya kamata ku je ku tambaye su.
We are there.	Muna can.
But he did not know.	Amma bai sani ba.
Don't try to say it has changed since then.	Kar ka yi ƙoƙari ka ce ya canza tun lokacin.
She must be here somewhere.	Dole ta kasance a nan wani wuri.
I saw how he felt about her.	Na ga yadda yake ji game da ita.
So if you like these, you definitely like this.	Don haka idan kuna son waɗannan, tabbas kuna son wannan.
Who gives the fly?	Wanene ke ba da tashi?
He knows me.	Ya san ni.
I lost sleep.	Na rasa barci.
I know that.	Na san da haka.
Anyone who has any thoughts.	Duk wanda yake da wani tunani.
There, 'he said.	Can can,' in ji shi.
I do not hear it.	Ba na jin shi.
That is scary.	Hakan yana da ban tsoro.
You can not talk to the person.	Ba za ku iya magana da mutumin ba.
Tell you what, it is not.	Ku gaya muku, ba haka ba ne.
I'm happy though.	Ina farin ciki ko da yake.
She is also not smart.	Ita ma ba ta da hankali.
Something that can be healthy, can be home.	Wani abu da zai iya zama lafiya, zai iya zama gida.
But there is nothing there.	Amma babu komai a wurin.
She is feeling well.	Tana jin lafiya.
Yet the story has a beautiful ending.	Amma duk da haka labarin yana da kyakkyawan ƙarshe.
There are so many.	Akwai da yawa.
You used it to run.	Kun yi amfani da shi don gudu.
You want to come here.	Kuna so ku zo nan.
You see he loves rain.	Ka ga yana son ruwan sama.
I will be on my way.	Zan kasance a hanya ta.
Tonight, we must be together.	A daren yau, dole ne mu kasance tare.
You know how good she is.	Kun san yadda ta kasance mai kyau.
He won’t wear it this year.	Ba zai sa shi a wannan shekara ba.
He says a lot.	Ya ce da yawa.
She sat, nothing.	Ta zauna, bata ce komai ba.
I do not know where he came from.	Ban san daga ina ya fito ba.
We can not wait.	Ba za mu iya jira ba.
Let's be real here.	Bari mu zama na gaske a nan.
And he could not see.	Kuma bai iya gani ba.
I don't want that anymore.	Ba na son hakan kuma.
It's hard, isn't it?	Yana da wuya, ko ba haka ba?
Everything he needs.	Duk abin da yake bukata.
We see the world not as things are but as we are.	Muna ganin duniya ba kamar yadda abubuwa suke ba amma yadda muke.
We are going well.	Muna tafiya da kyau.
And it seems to be getting worse every year.	Kuma ga alama yana samun wahala a kowace shekara.
They left you alone.	Sun bar ku kadai.
So we have this program.	Don haka muna da wannan shirin.
Sometimes you will feel instantly, and sometimes you will not.	Wani lokaci za ku ji sauƙi nan take, wani lokacin kuma ba za ku iya ba.
I killed him.	Na kashe shi.
Please, please, try not to cry.	Don Allah, don Allah, gwada kada ku yi kuka.
It was just a little bit.	Ya kasance kadan ne kawai.
But he never got on the boat.	Amma bai taba shiga cikin jirgin ba.
The kids are excited!	Yara sun yi farin ciki!
Wherever she was they were not.	Duk inda take ba su kasance ba.
But boy, was he upset before he talked to me.	Amma yaro, ya damu kafin ya yi magana da ni.
And he continued.	Kuma ya ci gaba.
He started to get up.	Ya fara tashi.
I have nothing to say.	Babu abin da zan ce.
This is not a pleasant thing.	Wannan ba abu ne mai daɗi ba.
But it is nothing.	Amma bata ce komai ba.
He does not need children.	Ba ya bukatar yara.
Every home should have one.	Kowane gida ya kamata ya kasance yana da ɗaya.
But it is not very good.	Amma ba shi da kyau sosai.
He protected them.	Ya kare su.
I have to do something.	Dole ne in yi wani abu.
I'm not interested in anything.	Ba ni da sha'awar komai.
it is a waste of time.	bata lokaci ne.
She felt the same way about me.	Haka ta ji a kaina.
They began to give him way as usual.	Suka fara ba shi hanya kamar yadda suka saba.
We can see how it works.	Za mu iya ganin yadda yake aiki.
To use one is to love it.	Don amfani da ɗaya shine son shi.
Good lunch.	Abincin rana mai kyau.
I know a good place.	Na san wuri mai kyau.
I used this method.	Na yi amfani da wannan hanyar.
You know your way.	Kun san hanyar ku.
I don't know why we are here.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa muke nan ba.
I do not know.	Ban sani ba.
We did not do this easily.	Ba mu yi hakan da sauƙi ba.
Mostly that they will kill them.	Mafi yawa cewa za su kashe su.
Today, no.	A yau, babu.
I care about her.	Na damu da ita.
Whatever he is going to do, he has to hurry.	Duk abin da zai yi, dole ne ya yi sauri.
He was right.	Ya yi daidai.
She just kind of changed it until the end.	Ta kawai irin canza shi har zuwa karshen.
I have a bad feeling.	Na sami mummunan ji.
I have a problem with this decision.	Ina da matsala da wannan shawarar.
Or miss it.	Ko rasa shi.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
For me somehow.	A gare ni ko ta yaya.
As it reads ?.	Kamar yadda ake karatu?.
He didn’t know that this was going to be something he should have done.	Bai san cewa wannan zai zama wani abu da ya kamata ya yi ba.
You, of course.	Kai, ba shakka.
This is completely false.	Wannan gaba daya karya ne.
And about funny things.	Kuma game da abubuwa masu ban dariya.
But there is really nothing for him.	Amma da gaske babu wani abu a gare shi.
Or so we think.	Ko haka muke tunani.
He still hasn't paid him anything.	Har yanzu bai biya shi komai ba.
He never heard them, as he did.	Bai taba jin su ba, kamar yadda ya yi.
The same is true here.	Haka yake a nan.
This is nothing new there.	Wannan ba sabon abu ba ne a can.
I'm sure you are.	Na tabbata kai ne.
And it is wrong.	Kuma ba daidai ba ne.
But it will not always be.	Amma ba koyaushe zai kasance ba.
It looks so good.	Kallon su yayi sosai.
I like it that way.	Ina son shi haka.
She almost gets.	Ta kusa samun.
It is not a mistake.	Ba kuskure ba ne.
If others help.	Idan sauran sun taimaka.
I do not agree with them.	Ban yarda da su ba.
Of course people did a little bit of it.	Tabbas mutane sun yi kadan daga ciki.
He had never heard of her.	Ya taba jin ta.
This is a great thing.	Wannan babban abu ne.
It is safe to assume that you are doing the right thing.	Yana da lafiya a ɗauka cewa kun yi daidai.
I can’t tell you that, of course.	Ba zan iya gaya muku hakan ba, ba shakka.
We need to go further.	Muna bukatar mu kara tafiya.
But we grew up.	Amma mun girma.
Only in this way can you prove it if it does not fit.	Ta haka ne kawai za ku iya tabbatar da ita idan ba ta dace ba.
It's amazing to do.	Yana da ban mamaki yin.
Life is not as simple as it used to be.	Rayuwa ba ta da sauƙi kamar yadda ta kasance.
And she must know where she is.	Kuma tabbas ta san inda take.
They tend to be sweet.	Suna yawan zama mai dadi.
If you are happy, say so.	Idan kana farin ciki, ka ce haka.
We can't do anything.	Ba za mu iya yin komai ba.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
The name of the great man.	Sunan babban mutum.
I know him well.	Na san shi da kyau.
It happened a lot.	Ya faru da yawa.
But do not sleep.	Amma kar a yi barci.
That's what they want.	Haka suke so.
That is what he needs.	Abin da yake bukata ke nan.
Doing otherwise would be totally inappropriate.	Yin in ba haka ba zai zama bai dace ba gaba ɗaya.
I started to get this amazing feeling I was proven wrong.	Na fara samun wannan ban mamaki jin na an tabbatar da ba daidai ba.
Place, place, place.	Wuri, wuri, wuri.
I like it more than that.	Na fi shi irin wannan abu.
Don’t try to be anything.	Kada ku yi ƙoƙarin zama wani abu.
You need to know this.	Kuna buƙatar sanin wannan.
Further reading is planned.	Ana shirin kara karatu.
It seems like a lost cause.	Da alama an rasa wata hanya.
Coffee tastes good, doesn't it?	Kofi yana da daɗi, ko ba haka ba?
What were you doing last night?	Me kuke yi a daren jiya?
Looking back.	Kallon baya.
I think a lot of people don’t get the book.	Ina tsammanin mutane da yawa ba sa samun littafin.
It is better to look at yourself.	Zai fi kyau ku kalli kanku.
And there is nothing he can do about it.	Kuma babu abin da zai iya yi game da shi.
Give him thirty days.	Ka ba shi kwana talatin.
Everything must die at some point in time.	Dole ne komai ya mutu a wani lokaci na lokaci.
Tomorrow, of course, tomorrow.	Gobe, tabbas, gobe.
As it happens, this pays off.	Kamar yadda ya faru, wannan ya biya.
I became part of my time.	Na zama na lokaci na.
I have to get out of the house.	Dole na fita daga gidan.
Even your story is not relevant.	Ko labarin ku bai dace ba.
But it is something, perhaps.	Amma wani abu ne, watakila.
Nothing flew, no talk, nothing.	Ba komai ya tashi, babu magana babu komai.
I tell you.	Ina gaya muku.
I am one of them.	Ina cikin su.
I don’t know how long we stopped like that.	Ban san tsawon lokacin da muka tsaya haka ba.
It was easy.	Ya zama mai sauƙi.
They need each other.	Suna bukatar juna.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
I like them a lot.	Ina son su da yawa.
For one thing, it's a lot of work.	Abu daya, aiki ne mai yawa.
I think you will never forget your place again.	Ina tsammanin ba za ku sake manta da wurin ku ba.
Just stop.	Ku tsaya kawai.
You are very careful.	Kuna yin hankali sosai.
I do not know how to sit.	Bata san zama ba.
Who knew it had one.	Wa ya san yana da daya.
She can get it for another day.	Za ta iya samun shi na wata rana.
As people read them.	Kamar yadda mutane ke karanta su.
Something is wrong with this.	Wani abu ba daidai ba ne game da wannan.
I will talk to you about it.	Zan yi magana da ku game da shi.
You know that is true.	Kun san cewa gaskiya ne.
It is very difficult.	Yana da matukar wahala.
Stand up for yourself and be yourself.	Tsaya ga kanku kuma ku kasance ku.
It is done as follows.	Ana yin haka kamar haka.
It doesn't work as well as you might think.	Ba ya aiki sosai kamar yadda kuke tunani.
I wrote to her.	Na rubuta mata.
It's weak, but it's there.	Yana da rauni, amma yana can.
Some come from other years.	Wasu sun zo daga wasu shekaru.
Someone like you.	Wata kamar ke.
And now he is very tired, somehow.	Kuma yanzu ya gaji sosai, ko ta yaya.
Even if she didn’t say she didn’t.	Ko da ba ta ce ba ta yi ba.
Maybe it's good to hear it.	Wataƙila yana da kyau a ce ya ji.
This is not true though.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane ko da yake.
You are not with him, it is a great thing.	Ba ka tare da shi, shi ne babban abu.
But not for food.	Amma ba don abinci ba.
Hurry if you want to get there faster.	Yi sauri idan kana son isa wurin da sauri.
I want to change this.	Ina so in canza wannan.
The others did not.	Sauran ba su yi ba.
He won't tell you.	Ba zai gaya maka ba.
It is very intelligent.	Yana da hankali sosai.
What is happening is happening.	Abin da ke faruwa yana faruwa.
Interestingly, this trip will not be, for sure.	Abin sha'awa, wannan tafiya ba za ta kasance ba, ta tabbata.
They did so only by mistake.	Sun yi haka ne kawai saboda kuskure.
They take care of them.	Suka kula da su.
It's amazing, like something a kid would do.	Ga shi abin mamaki, kamar wani abu da yaro zai yi.
But we can cover it.	Amma za mu iya rufe shi.
They will hear us.	Za su ji mu.
It is not true.	Shi ba gaskiya ba ne.
Let it cool down a bit.	Bari ya dan yi sanyi.
He too has things to do.	Shi ma yana da abubuwan da zai yi.
For a moment he thought he had lost her.	Na d'an lokaci yana tunanin ya rasa ta.
Honestly, this is not comfortable.	Gaskiya, wannan ba dadi.
Wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
I'll wait for you, here.	Zan jira ku, a nan.
That will change.	Hakan zai canza.
They gave him water.	Suka ba shi ruwa.
That is a fact.	Hakan ya tabbata.
He feels ill.	Yana jin rashin lafiya.
I don't have to worry.	Bai kamata in damu ba.
And now he does.	Kuma yanzu ya yi.
What do you think of the house?	Me kuke tunanin gidan?
We changed that.	Mun canza wannan.
He was very accommodating.	Ya kasance mai yarda sosai.
She feels loved.	Ta ji tana son su sosai.
I should not have left you.	Bai kamata na bar ku ba.
It would be better, of course.	Zai fi kyau haka, babu shakka.
I love it, though.	Ina son shi, ko da yake.
It's nice to be the best, but it's harder to stay there.	Yana da kyau ya zama mafi kyau, amma ya fi wuya a zauna a can.
She stood back.	Ta tsaya a baya.
Or you may no longer be yourself.	Ko kuma ka daina zama kai.
This should be an easy task.	Wannan ya kamata ya zama aiki mai sauƙi.
But nothing.	Amma babu komai.
We explain why.	Mun bayyana dalilin da ya sa.
I do, however, hope it happens more often than not.	Ina yi, duk da haka, fatan abin ya faru sau da yawa fiye da yadda yake faruwa.
She begins to cry.	Sai ta fara kuka.
It is difficult to write.	Yana da wuya a rubuta shi.
Let me get in first.	Bari in fara shiga.
They are so beautiful.	Suna da kyau haka.
He has no speech.	Ba shi da magana.
This really kills me.	Wannan yana kashe ni da gaske.
We have your tools.	Muna da kayan aikin ku.
That being said it is so.	Abin da yake cewa haka ne.
I knew she was.	Na san ta kasance.
The man who was there now hurried away.	Mutumin da yake can yanzu ya yi sauri ya tafi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lokaci yayi da zai fara tafiya.
I am talking about the future.	Ina magana ne a nan gaba.
Finally, she decided she could not wait.	A ƙarshe, ta yanke shawarar ba za ta jira ba.
Maybe getting more involved was a bad idea.	Wataƙila samun ƙarin shiga ya kasance mummunan tunani.
But no one.	Amma babu kowa.
Of course I will do it again.	Tabbas zan sake yin hakan.
This is not nearly as much as we have ever experienced.	Wannan bai kusan yawa kamar yadda muka taɓa samu ba.
I’m not sure we’re the best, but we’re definitely enjoying it.	Ban tabbata mun fi kyau ba, amma tabbas muna jin daɗi.
It felt really good.	Ya ji dadi sosai.
I know you are working.	Na san kana yin aiki.
She is no better.	Ba ta fi kyau ba.
I go to work every day.	Ina tafiya don aiki kowace rana.
The next thing to make money.	Abu na gaba don samun kuɗi.
I can not remember the name.	Na kasa tuna sunan.
We will grow up and the celebration will begin.	Za mu yi girma kuma za a fara bikin.
He knows the game.	Ya san wasan.
What should they do.	Me ya kamata su.
Not much water.	Ba ruwa mai yawa ba.
How it is.	Yadda abin yake.
What a great achievement.	Abin da babban nasara.
To see what we can see, like.	Don ganin abin da za mu iya gani, kamar.
Is it really.	Shin da gaske ne.
The next night.	Da dare na gaba.
There is much more work to be done.	Akwai sauran aiki da yawa da za a yi.
Then he came back.	Sai ya dawo.
That will continue.	Hakan zai ci gaba.
I do not allow you to think so.	Ban yarda kuna tunanin haka ba.
Fear also spoke.	Tsoro ma ta yi magana.
No one seems to be working.	Babu wani da alama yana aiki.
Of course he could not.	Tabbas bai iya ba.
He is close now, close.	Ya kasance kusa yanzu, kusa.
It is not the time to talk about this.	Ba lokacin magana akan wannan bane yanzu.
I'll take it.	Zan tafi da shi.
Flee	Gudu
She is not well.	Ba ta da lafiya.
But what happened happened.	Amma abin da ya faru ya faru.
Try to work before your dog comes along with you.	Yi ƙoƙarin yin aiki kafin kare ku ya zo tare da ku.
Kids are smart.	Yara suna da hankali.
I came here by bus.	Na zo nan ta bas.
We take everyone who is there.	Muna ɗaukar duk wanda yake can.
The car sped off.	Motar ta kara sauri.
Maybe he didn't read it all.	Wataƙila bai karanta duka ba.
I do not know how to proceed.	Ban san yadda za a ci gaba ba.
I know how it works.	Na san yadda yake aiki.
The interest grew.	Sha'awar ta girma.
It may take up to two years.	Yana iya ɗaukar shekaru biyu.
You are.	Kai ne.
It took him a month before he left.	Sai da ya yi wata guda kafin ya tafi.
She grew up, she got sick.	Ta girma, ta yi rashin lafiya.
But keep running.	Amma ci gaba da gudu.
So we take that seriously.	Don haka muna kallon hakan da gaske.
Getting up was not difficult.	Tashi bai yi wuya ba.
There is work to be done.	Akwai aikin da za a yi.
She feels cold.	Ta ji sanyi.
I shouldn't have eaten much last night.	Bai kamata na ci abinci da yawa ba a daren jiya.
Ask your doctor ahead of time so you know where to go.	Tambayi likitan ku kafin lokaci don ku san inda za ku.
This is what life is all about.	Wannan shi ne abin da rayuwa ta kasance.
Honestly I can't say.	Gaskiya ba zan iya fada ba.
She could not decide what to do.	Ta kasa yanke shawarar me zata yi.
Without being asked.	Ba tare da an tambaye ta ba.
He would never get them.	Ba zai taba samun su ba.
I started to find myself.	Na fara samun kaina.
Maybe he added.	Watakila ya kara cewa.
You, however, know better.	Kai, duk da haka, ka fi sani.
Everyone loves her, you see.	Kowa ya so ta, ka gani.
Stop here.	Ku tsaya a nan.
He gave us everything we had.	Ya ba mu duk abin da muke da shi.
It is an easy access to water.	Yana da sauƙi mai sauƙi zuwa ga ruwa.
Just to get it.	Kawai don samun shi.
He should not have been arrested in the first place.	Tun da farko bai kamata a kama shi ba.
We can not know.	Ba za mu iya sani ba.
So let me try to help.	Don haka bari in gwada taimaka.
And that makes me happier than anything else.	Kuma hakan yana sa ni farin ciki fiye da komai.
Not everyone went, though.	Ba kowa ya tafi ba, ko da yake.
Too much water is left out.	An bar ruwa mai yawa.
We can do this again if we want to.	Za mu iya sake yin hakan idan muna so.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
This is normal.	Wannan shi ne na yau da kullum.
It has to be immediate, though.	Dole ne ya zama nan da nan, ko da yake.
I should have known.	Ya kamata in sani.
He just does that.	Yana yin haka kawai.
They really were in it.	Da gaske sun kasance a ciki.
Whatever it is, start there, and do it well.	Duk abin da yake, fara can, kuma ku yi kyau da shi.
I said, better sleep.	Na ce, gara barci.
Maybe we can't.	Wataƙila ba za mu iya ba.
This is what happened.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya faru.
It's a nice day.	Yana da kyau rana.
He was one of the best.	Ya kasance daya daga cikin mafi kyau.
He was always the best.	Ya kasance mafi kyau koyaushe.
It's too cold.	Yayi sanyi sosai.
I think it opened up in the right way.	Ina tsammanin ya bude ta hanyar da ta dace.
Still so right now.	Har yanzu haka a yanzu.
She was arrested by police.	‘Yan sanda sun kama ta.
But we know that sometimes there is.	Amma mun san cewa wani lokacin akwai.
Let me tell you this.	Bari in gaya muku wannan.
Water is the most abundant substance in the world.	Ruwa shine abu mafi yawa a duniya.
He is tired of living with it.	Ya gaji da zama da shi.
She flew above him.	Ta tashi sama da shi.
It's a good thing.	Abu ne mai kyau.
There will be an opportunity to achieve that.	Za a sami damar isa ga hakan.
So is this.	Haka ma wannan.
Even crying failed.	Ko kuka ya kasa yi.
Everything seems difficult.	Komai yayi kamar wuya.
He goes to school.	Yana makaranta.
Always hope for the best.	Koyaushe fatan mafi kyau.
It should be very cold.	Ya kamata yayi sanyi sosai.
They will tell us where to go.	Za su gaya mana inda za mu je.
Now he knows what this is all about.	Yanzu ya san menene wannan wani abu.
It's not mine anymore.	Ba nawa bane kuma.
They are there, and they are looking for us.	Suna can, kuma suna neman mu.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
She said immediately.	Nan take ta ce.
That is the feeling here.	Wannan ji ne a nan.
Not all, though.	Ba duka ba, ko da yake.
But he could speak.	Amma ya iya magana.
It's late.	Lokaci ya wuce.
You must see that.	Dole ne ku ga haka.
It's amazing what he's doing.	Yana da ban mamaki abin da yake yi.
You're all in it together.	Kuna duka a ciki tare.
They all did well.	Duk sun yi kyau.
And close to it because we suffered so much.	Kuma kusa da ita saboda mun sha wahala sosai.
But not in the past.	Amma ba a baya ba.
No one knows when.	Ba wanda ya san lokacin.
Happiness in life.	Abubuwan farin ciki a rayuwa.
How wonderful it was to fly without you around.	Yaya ban mamaki ya tashi ba tare da ku kusa ba.
They lived.	Sun yi rayuwa.
And the best.	Kuma mafi kyau.
It's really, really hot.	Yana da gaske, zafi sosai.
I get a lot of work from it.	Ina samun babban aiki daga gare ta.
He will use us.	Zai yi amfani da mu.
You just can't do it.	Kawai ba za ku yi ba.
I stayed with him.	Na zauna da shi.
The problem is, someone did.	Matsalar ita ce, wani ya yi.
You can not leave.	Ba za ku iya barin ba.
He does not want to take it anymore.	Baya so ya kara dauka.
I still have a lot to say.	Har yanzu ina da abubuwa da yawa da zan ce.
Ever since they were kids.	Tun suna yara.
We will get there.	Za mu isa can.
We should start by saying that they are not.	Ya kamata mu fara cewa ba su ba.
He lives alone.	Shi kadai yake zaune.
He speaks entirely here.	Ya yi magana gaba ɗaya a nan.
It's very amazing, that.	Yana da matukar ban mamaki, cewa.
But we all took it.	Amma mu duka mun dauka.
She would not go without him.	Ba za ta tafi ba tare da shi ba.
A weak sun never enters this room.	Rana mai rauni bai taba shiga wannan dakin ba.
Nothing to fear.	Babu abin da za a ji tsoro.
I will not wait any longer.	Ba zan kara jira ba.
I saved it.	Na ajiye shi.
Get out of your way.	Fita daga hanyar ku.
I like running outside.	Ina son gudu a waje.
It is a simple fact.	Gaskiya ce mai sauƙi.
I want them to be happy, surprised.	Ina so su yi farin ciki, mamaki.
To start working.	Don fara aiki.
We returned early.	Mun koma da wuri.
He paid.	Ya biya.
However this is happening for something out there.	Duk da haka wannan yana faruwa ga wani abu daga can.
He almost killed him.	Ya kusa kashe shi.
I know funny things are happening to me.	Na san abubuwa masu ban dariya suna faruwa da ni.
People care about each other here.	Mutane sun damu da juna a nan.
It should be here in two days.	Ya kamata a zo nan da kwana biyu.
None has ever lied.	Babu ko daya da ya taba karya.
Have you heard of the new restaurant?	Shin kun ji labarin sabon gidan abincin?
I don’t want to think sick.	Ba na son yin tunanin rashin lafiya.
There is a little surprise.	Akwai kadan mai ban mamaki.
And we all know what will happen then.	Kuma duk mun san abin da zai faru a lokacin.
Leave the rest to us.	Ku bar mana sauran.
What works on one does not always work on another.	Abin da ke aiki akan ɗaya ba koyaushe yana aiki akan wani ba.
I do not understand what this is.	Ban gane menene wannan ba.
Come to us if you can.	Ku zo mana idan kuna iya.
You cry a lot.	Kuka yayi sosai.
I tell you this.	Ina gaya muku wannan.
She came for me.	Ta zo nawa.
We'll watch the game.	Za mu kalli wasan.
So it is good he is suffering.	Don haka yana da kyau yana shan wahala.
He gave them life.	Ya ba su rai.
It has been passed backwards.	An wuce da baya.
I think we got it right.	Ina ganin mun samu daidai.
This is amazing.	Wannan abin ban mamaki ne.
Everything that happens will happen twice.	Duk abin da ya faru zai faru sau biyu.
Give it a go.	Ba shi wani tafi.
If there are people.	Idan akwai mutane.
The next point is not so.	Magana ta gaba ba haka bane.
It is time to act.	Lokaci ya yi da za a yi aiki.
I was wrong.	Na yi kuskure.
I'm not sure it suits her.	Ban tabbata ya dace da ita ba.
Too many, and we don’t know what they are.	Da yawa, kuma ba mu san menene su ba.
Nothing interesting.	Babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa.
But do not be afraid.	Amma kada ku ji tsoro.
We knew we had to do something.	Mun san dole ne mu yi wani abu.
We were.	Mun kasance.
This was not done.	Ba a yi haka ba.
How can I go about this.	Yaya zan iya tafiya game da wannan.
I'll get out of the way.	Zan fita daga hanya.
Everyone must live.	Dole ne kowa ya yi rayuwa.
I let me wait.	Na bari na jira.
He looked at them quickly.	Ya duba su da sauri.
And he doesn't want her to go again.	Kuma baya son ta sake tafiya.
I hope we can.	Ina fata za mu iya.
This, too, is a lie.	Wannan kuma, karya ne.
Now that is not true.	Yanzu hakan ba gaskiya ba ne.
I can't really believe this.	Ba zan iya yarda da wannan sosai ba.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
Contribute well to the work done.	Taimaka wa aikin da aka yi sosai.
We will fix it for everyone.	Za mu gyara wa kowa.
I understand why it happened.	Na fahimci dalilin da ya sa abin ya faru.
He knew it would not be long.	Ya san ba zai dade ba.
I have prepared dinner for you.	Na shirya muku abincin dare.
Yesterday things changed and the reason is not clear.	Jiya abin ya canza kuma dalilin bai bayyana ba.
She, who was	Ta, wanda ya
But nothing.	Amma ba komai.
He said 'maybe not'.	Yace 'watakila ba'.
Put your tools in perspective.	Sanya kayan aikin ku da kyau.
I'm very sorry.	Bani da hakuri.
It must be over.	Dole ne ya gama.
They do not interest me.	Ba su bani sha'awa ba.
Who is he?	Shin wanene shi.
I started walking fast.	Na fara tafiya da sauri.
But they will not lose their food.	Amma ba za su rasa abinci ba.
I couldn't do either.	Ni ma ban iya yi ba.
She could not see no boat.	Ba ta iya ganin babu jirgin ruwa.
Somehow, she continued.	Ko ta yaya, ta ci gaba.
Hear it.	Ji shi.
I'm afraid there is only one.	Ina jin tsoro akwai daya kawai.
Everyone seems to know each other.	Kowa kamar ya san juna.
He wants a big house and a nice car.	Yana son babban gida da mota mai kyau.
The water is very cold.	Ruwan yayi sanyi sosai.
And even more so.	Kuma ya fi haka.
Use what and how much it feels right for you.	Yi amfani da abin da kuma nawa ji daidai a gare ku.
Everything else he left behind.	Duk sauran abubuwan da ya bari.
The person has nothing in it.	Mutumin ba shi da komai daga ciki.
I do not understand how this is written.	Ban fahimci yadda ake rubuta wannan ba.
After a while, they succeeded.	Bayan wani lokaci kadan, sun yi nasara.
Do not hesitate to seek help.	Kada ku yi shakka don neman taimako.
And he did.	Kuma ya yi .
You will learn to love him.	Za ku koyi son shi.
She loved him day and night.	Ta so shi dare da rana.
Now, of course, she didn’t want to be anything at the time.	Yanzu, ba shakka, ba ta son zama wani abu a lokacin.
When you go.	Lokacin da kuka tafi.
Something.	Da wani abu .
This works.	Wannan yana aiki.
Now he too is gone.	Yanzu shi ma ya tafi.
There is no way out, no way home.	Babu hanyar fita, babu hanyar gida.
You will all be better off.	Za ku fi kyau duka.
It should not be so.	Bai kamata ya kasance haka ba.
They did not kill anything, he said.	Ba su kashe komai ba, in ji shi.
You can see that.	Kuna iya ganin hakan.
She is definitely fine.	Ba ta da shakka suna lafiya.
Think about back calls.	Tunani game da kira baya.
I have to make the right time.	Dole ne in yi lokacin daidai.
But she could not see anything.	Amma ta kasa ganin komai.
So it might be something better.	Don haka yana iya zama abu mafi kyau.
Coming on a day like this.	Mai zuwa a rana irin wannan.
A sad day.	Ranar bakin ciki.
I was scared.	Na ji tsoro.
But others are working.	Amma wasu kuma suna aiki.
One daily.	Daya kowace rana.
There is something amazing here.	Akwai ban mamaki a nan.
Bring it home and show it to me.	Ka kawo gida ka nuna min.
I suspect he knew everything about it.	Ina zargin cewa ya san komai game da shi.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
He was arrested	An kama
The program is good, but it is useless.	Shirin yana da kyau, amma ba shi da amfani.
Something intelligent that I knew.	Wani abu na hankali da na sani.
She was called home early.	An kira ta gida da wuri.
It hurts.	Me wahala.
I have my answer.	Ina da amsa ta.
You'd better come back now.	Gara ka dawo nan yanzu.
He has no hearing.	Ba shi da ji.
A little talk is needed.	Ana buƙatar magana kaɗan.
With this handsome man, he bought my boat.	Tare da wannan mutumin mai kyau, ya sayi jirgin ruwa na.
That is what appeared to me.	Abin da ya bayyana a gare ni ke nan.
These are beginning to appear.	Waɗannan sun fara bayyana.
I want her to go with us.	Na so ta tafi tare da mu.
I don’t have to worry about them to see that.	Ba sai na damu da su ba don ganin haka.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Good food, of course.	Abinci mai kyau, tabbas.
Be sure to tell us how beautiful we are.	Ka tabbata ka gaya mana yadda kyawun mu yake.
And you have to do it.	Kuma dole ne ku yi hakan.
Is the name wrong.	Shin sunan ba daidai ba ne.
I think no one around me knows about it.	Ina tsammanin babu wanda ke kusa da ni ya sani game da shi.
But this is not happening right.	Amma wannan baya faruwa daidai.
They got married the following year.	Sun yi aure shekara mai zuwa.
The taste is delicious, but happy.	Dadi yana da daɗi, amma farin ciki.
I want to look ahead.	Ina son kallon gaba.
No chance to reappear.	Babu damar sake bayyana.
Some sat on the floor.	Wasu suka zauna a kasa.
It's really there.	Yana can da gaske.
I don't have to do anything.	Ba sai na yi wani abu ba.
I change almost.	Ina canza kusan.
He was gentle, but he was right.	Ya kasance a hankali, amma ya kasance daidai.
They are so beautiful.	Suna da kyau sosai.
Only then did he agree to go.	Kawai sai ya yarda ya tafi.
Maybe it was something.	Wataƙila ya kasance abu ne.
No, she did not.	A'a, ba ta yi ba.
That makes me sit now.	Wannan ya sa ni zama a yanzu.
We fear it will happen.	Mun ji tsoron hakan zai faru.
I would say that.	Zan ce haka.
It's too close.	Ya yi kusa da yawa sosai.
We talked.	Mun yi magana.
This is a big fear for many people.	Wannan babban tsoro ne ga mutane da yawa.
Don't cry too much about it.	Kada ku yi kuka sosai game da shi.
You do not know what is happening.	Ba ku san abin da ke faruwa ba.
And we need someone.	Kuma muna bukatar wani.
I made my way and it was a success.	Na yi hanya kuma an yi nasara.
I don't need anything else.	Bana bukatar wani abu kuma.
It seems.	Da alama.
This program is backwards.	Wannan shirin ya koma baya.
Or maybe that happened.	Ko watakila hakan ya faru.
I think he might want to publish it.	Ina tsammanin zai iya son buga shi.
Everyone lied to me.	Kowa yayi min karya.
But it is good with it now.	Amma yana da kyau da shi yanzu.
He knew how much he hated them.	Ya san yadda ya taɓa ƙi su.
It's just there.	Yana can kawai.
I can only change myself.	Zan iya canza kaina kawai.
We keep running.	Muna ci gaba da gudu.
Enjoy, because you did a great job here.	Ji daɗi, saboda kun yi babban aiki a nan.
Preferences are immediate.	Abubuwan da ake so suna nan da nan.
The same person.	Haka mutumin.
If he has no money, he cannot pay.	Idan ba shi da kudi, ba zai iya biya ba.
And that's it, you know.	Kuma shi ke nan, ka sani.
Stay tuned for the program.	Tsaya ga shirin.
But gradually it became difficult to do.	Amma a hankali ya zama da wuya a yi.
He is completely human now.	Ya kasance gaba daya mutum yanzu.
We think of you every day.	Muna tunanin ku kowace rana.
I know how.	Na san yadda.
And just, you know.	Kuma kawai, kun sani.
Please understand what I am saying.	Da fatan kun gane abin da nake cewa.
They felt uncomfortable about it.	Sun ji ba dadi game da shi.
He laughed.	Ya yi dariya.
We are very happy.	Mun yi farin ciki sosai.
I asked who?	Na tambayi wanene?
I laughed to myself.	Na yi dariya kai na.
They should be able to recognize it from there.	Ya kamata su iya gane shi daga can.
Some of these are very good.	Wasu daga cikin waɗannan suna da kyau sosai.
Hurry up, or you'll be late for work!	Yi sauri, ko za ku makara don aiki!
Here is the best one.	Ga wanda ya fi kyau.
This is one reason why it should not be here.	Wannan shi ne dalilin daya sa bai kamata ya kasance a nan ba.
However, they want more time together.	Duk da haka, suna son ƙarin lokaci tare.
We do not speak.	Ba mu magana.
When or why not.	Yaushe ko me yasa ba a sani ba.
It is enough to pass.	Ya isa ya wuce.
I think this is enough.	Ina ganin wannan ya isa haka.
She closed the book carefully.	Ta rufe littafin a hankali.
Prepare her for the game.	Yi mata shirin wasan.
Like he was waiting for us.	Kamar ya jira mu.
This, however, is not entirely true.	Wannan, duk da haka, ba gaskiya bane gaba ɗaya.
She lives alone.	Tana zaune ita kadai.
Try something new.	Gwada sabon abu.
This is an amazing thing.	Wannan abu ne mai ban mamaki.
He told us to stop and we stopped.	Ya ce mu tsaya muka tsaya.
I'm dead	Na mutu
Not all children are healthy.	Ba duka yara ba ne lafiya.
You may lose consciousness.	Kuna iya rasa hankali.
Will you find out for me what’s going on?	Za ku gano min abin da ke faruwa?
He is a very intelligent man.	Mutum ne mai hankali.
He will be back tomorrow.	Gobe ​​zai dawo nan.
I would never expect that to happen.	Ba zan taba tsammanin hakan zai faru ba.
I do not want to talk about it.	Bana son magana a kansa.
Check did not come.	Duba bai zo ba.
I told him no way.	Na ce masa ba yadda za a yi.
For it, we can use.	Don shi, za mu iya amfani da.
Now, let's get involved.	Yanzu, bari mu shiga.
Do not fix it.	Kar ku gyara shi.
I will continue to help you there.	Zan ci gaba da taimaka muku a can.
She called the police for help	Ta kira 'yan sanda don neman taimako
I didn't know he would do that.	Ban san zai yi hakan ba.
I could make a mistake, though.	Zan iya yin kuskure, ko da yake.
And here.	Kuma a nan.
It makes everyone think.	Yana sa kowa yayi tunani.
But they did not say much.	Amma ba su ce da yawa ba.
Don't be late.	Kar a makara.
Everyone has something or someone who cares.	Kowa yana da wani abu ko wanda ya damu da shi.
What it is we do not know.	Abin da shi ne ba mu sani ba.
So far nothing shows.	Ya zuwa yanzu babu abin da ya nuna.
We started to get to know each other.	Mun fara samun juna.
Easier for everyone without heat.	Mafi sauƙi ga kowa da kowa ba tare da zafi ba.
She is her.	Ita ce ta.
I knew something was up.	Na san wani abu ya tashi.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
A woman entered.	Wata mata ta shiga.
And he was good.	Kuma ya kasance mai kyau.
Anything big like that wouldn’t change much.	Duk wani abu mai girma irin wannan ba zai canza da yawa ba.
Yet they run behind.	Duk da haka suna gudu a baya.
And there are many.	Kuma akwai da yawa.
They are things.	Abubuwa ne.
But try it and see how much it will help you.	Amma gwada shi ku ga nawa zai taimake ku.
It felt amazing.	Ya ji ban mamaki.
I was not much help.	Ban kasance taimako mai yawa ba.
I'm tired of driving so far.	Na gaji da tuƙi zuwa yanzu.
She will be back.	Zata dawo.
It's in a beautiful place.	Yana cikin kyakkyawan wuri.
Nice home.	Gida mai kyau.
About who can really we do not know.	Game da wanda zai iya gaske ba mu sani ba.
They are not married.	Ba a yi aure ba.
Not time to travel, not time to eat.	Ba lokacin tafiya ba, ba lokacin cin abinci ba.
I can't keep them inside.	Ba zan iya ajiye su a ciki ba.
We raised our hands and left.	Muka daga hannu muka tafi.
You will be yourself, closed in on yourself.  	Za ku zama kanku, rufe cikin kanku.  
I'm not sure what that is, right.	Ban tabbata menene hakan ba, daidai.
I meet him now.	Na hadu da shi a yanzu.
It was a lot of fun to do.	Ya kasance mai ban sha'awa da yawa don yin.
Do whatever you would normally do.	Yi duk abin da za ku saba yi.
We didn't fly much.	Ba mu tashi da yawa ba.
We are not in what he is doing.	Ba mu cikin abin da yake yi.
I'll find out what's going on.	Zan gano me ke faruwa.
Two for you.	Biyu a gare ku.
This method is not complete yet.	Wannan hanyar ba ta cika ba tukuna.
The world is a wonderful place.	Duniya wuri ne mai ban mamaki.
They are made of leather.	An yi su da fata.
Maybe it's a game we will enjoy.	Wataƙila wasa ne da za mu ji daɗi.
Developers are looking forward.	Masu ci gaba suna kallon gaba.
I think that sometimes.	Ina tunanin hakan wani lokaci.
This book is this journey.	Wannan littafin shine wannan tafiya.
More than once, in fact.	Fiye da sau ɗaya, a gaskiya.
All this together.	Duk wannan tare.

You do not know what is there.	Ba ku san abin da ke can ba.
I did not stop.	Ban tsaya ba.
If he goes he goes.	Idan ya tafi ya tafi.
Dinner is served.	Ana yin abincin dare.
Do the rest.	Yi sauran abu.
Water is necessary for good health.	Ruwa ya zama dole don lafiya mai kyau.
Everything.	Komai komai.
I think they are very close.	Ina tsammanin suna kusa sosai.

Someone answered from above.	Wani ya amsa daga sama.
She is not well.	Ba ta da lafiya.
We will try to bring them here without delay.	Za mu yi ƙoƙari mu kawo su nan ba tare da bata lokaci ba.
Of course there is this.	Tabbas akwai wannan.
Did you think what to say?	Kun yi tunanin abin da za ku ce?
I do not feel very well.	Ba na jin dadi sosai.
It makes her feel better.	Yana sa ta ji ta fi.
In fact, maybe you can answer that.	A gaskiya, watakila za ku iya amsa wannan.
There has never been a problem.	Ba a taɓa samun matsala ba.
We worked.	Mun yi aiki.
It's for the best.	Yana da ga mafi kyau.

He felt like a man.	Ya ji kamar mutum.
I am cold	Ina sanyi
He wasn’t even interested in it, though.	Ba a ma sha'awar shi ba, duk da haka.
I myself have heard.	Ni kaina na ji.
It's just amazing.	Abin mamaki ne kawai.
You can do more than that.	Kuna iya yin abin da ya fi haka.
I want to make you think.	Ina so in sa ka yi tunani.
He too will go.	Shi ma zai tafi.
Check that everything is complete.	Duba cewa komai ya cika.
But we did not write the book.	Amma ba mu rubuta littafin ba.
Now I can walk again.	Yanzu zan iya sake tafiya.
But it was done very well.	Amma an yi shi sosai.
I will not let you leave me yet.	Ba zan bar ku ku bar ni ba tukuna.
She reads it playing.	Tana karanta shi yana wasa.
You have to be human.	Dole ne ku kasance mutum.
Then I put them inside.	Sai na sa su ciki.
Enough to go.	Ya isa ya tafi.
Coffee is provided.	An ba da kofi.
I have to get you back.	Dole ne in dawo da ku.
It does not work with anyone.	Ba ya aiki da kowa.
Third, make and give beverages.	Na uku, yi da kuma ba da abubuwan sha.
We just play and walk.	Muna wasa muna tafiya kawai.
They say it is raining.	Sun ce ruwan sama ya kusa.
Closely.	A hankali.
You were surprised at night.	Kun yi mamaki a daren.
He hit it well.	Ya buga shi da kyau.
I will work.	Zan yi aiki.
And they tell each other everything.	Kuma suna gaya wa juna komai.
But he was right.	Amma yayi gaskiya.
Get them out.	Fita da su.
He did not think so, he said.	Bai yi tunanin haka ba, ya ce.
Now, this is a really big thing.	Yanzu, wannan abu ne mai girma gaske.
There is so much you can do.	Akwai da yawa da za ku iya yi.
He enters the room, realizing something is wrong.	Yana shiga d'akin, ya san wani abu ba daidai ba.
Things are interesting here.	Abubuwa suna da ban sha'awa a nan.
I really like where we ended up.	Ina matukar son inda muka kare.
But this is not the case.	Amma ba haka yake ba.
But nothing happened.	Amma kuma babu wani abu da ya faru.
You do not eat.	Ba ka ci.
He is the best, and he knows.	Shi ne mafi kyau, kuma ya sani.
My age.	Shekaru nawa.
Maybe it doesn’t necessarily have to be money.	Wataƙila ba lallai ne ya zama kuɗi ba.
I really don't want to go.	Lallai bana son tafiya.
And we will leave it soon.	Kuma za mu bar shi nan da nan.
There is no way to know for sure, there is.	Babu wata hanyar da za a sani tabbas, akwai.
Not if you want to live.	Ba idan kuna son zama da rai ba.
I'd like to see.	Ina so in gani.
And still fine.	Kuma har yanzu lafiya.
Now, let's get started.	Yanzu, bari mu fara.
She is very beautiful.	Tana da kyau sosai.
I have never seen a single life.	Ban taba ganin rai ko daya ba.
I knew it would happen.	Na san zai faru.
Did you still get the error?	Shin har yanzu kun sami kuskure?
Of course this is what caught him off guard.	Tabbas wannan ne ya kama shi.
I prefer walking at night.	Na fi son tafiya da dare.
You can have others go.	Kuna iya samun wasu ku tafi.
He has no problem with that.	Ba shi da wata matsala da hakan.
We are not one people.	Mu ba mutane ɗaya ba ne.
She tells us that she knows nothing.	Ta gaya mana cewa ba ta san komai ba.
They have the right tools for this job.	Suna da kayan aikin da suka dace don wannan aikin.
They will not find our interest.	Ba za su sami sha'awar mu ba.
I'm leaving now.	Zan tafi yanzu.
What we are saying, together.	Abin da muke cewa, tare.
Now he added another to protect him.	Yanzu ya kara wani don ya kare shi.
There are many disadvantages for the user from this method.	Akwai rashin amfani da yawa ga mai amfani daga wannan hanyar.
Here they return.	Nan suka koma.
So talk.	Don haka magana.
He can live with this.	Zai iya rayuwa da wannan.
I'm sure this will happen soon, though.	Na tabbata wannan zai yi sauri, ko da yake.
In fact, no one was happy with it at all.	A gaskiya, babu wanda ya yi farin ciki da shi gaba ɗaya.
Otherwise, you would not be living in it.	In ba haka ba, da ba za ku zauna a ciki ba.
Some of these were terrifying.	Wasu daga cikin waɗannan sun kasance masu ban tsoro.
It is the most beautiful sight of all year.	Shi ne mafi kyawun gani a duk shekara.
The decision must stand.	Dole ne shawarar ta tsaya.
Check it out, please, if you would like.	Duba shi, don Allah, idan za ku so.
I turned on the water.	Na kunna mata ruwan.
I am very happy now.	Ina matukar farin ciki yanzu.
Now it's gone.	Yanzu abin ya tafi.
They want to see.	Suna son gani.
No one caught her.	Ba wanda ya kama ta.
More than happy.	Fiye da farin ciki.
Nice to see.	Yayi kyau gani.
When he preceded me, he stopped.	Lokacin da ya riga ni, ya tsaya.
Either way it’s still good.	Ko ta yaya har yanzu yana da kyau.
But it is not written that way.	Amma ba haka ake rubuta shi ba.
We did not travel.	Ba mu yi tafiya ba.
We are still working.	Har yanzu muna aiki.
If you want to do your best, you can.	Idan kuna son yin mafi kyau, kuna iya.
Sometimes we go for it, sometimes we don't go for it.	Wani lokaci mu tafi da shi, wani lokacin ba ma tafiya da shi.
If she dies, there is no way to do it.	Idan ta mutu, babu yadda za a yi.
I went back to the meeting.	Na koma wurin taron.
We will give them what they want.	Za mu ba su abin da suke so.
He certainly hoped so.	Ya tabbata ya yi fatan haka.
In the past, it was easy.	A da, yana da sauƙi.
Reading or eating.	Karatu ko cin abinci.
But they know better.	Amma sun fi sani.
I could not recognize him.	Ba zan iya gane shi ba.
The house is beautiful.	Gidan yana da kyau.
I am a human being	Ni mutum ne
The book is well written and makes the process easy.	An rubuta littafin da kyau kuma yana sa hanyar ta zama mai sauƙi.
What you have done is very good.	Abin da kuka yi yana da kyau sosai.
But the man committed suicide.	Amma mutumin ya kashe kansa.
However, it is still good.	Duk da haka, har yanzu yana da kyau.
He told me to check in in three days.	Ya ce in duba nan da kwana uku.
It can be taken seriously.	Zai iya ɗauka da gaske.
He recognized him immediately.	Ya gane shi nan da nan.
All they need is food.	Abin da suke bukata shi ne abinci.
He also took a stick.	Ya kuma dauki sanda.
You are me now.	Kai ni yanzu.
I almost won.	Na kusa samun nasara.
I'll try it.	Zan gwada shi.
I lost my job today.	Na rasa aiki yau.
And now that seems like the best answer.	Kuma a yanzu hakan yayi kama da mafi kyawun amsa.
Do them one by one.	Yi su daya bayan daya.
I like that	Ina son hakan
I really do.	Na yi gaske.
Let me see you again.	Bari in sake gani.
I'm sorry about that.	Na yi hakuri da wannan.
I heard you say something.	Na ji ka ce wani abu.
Not too cold, not too hot.	Ba sanyi sosai, ba zafi sosai.
Had he appeared, we would have seen more.	Idan da ya bayyana, da mun kara gani.
All this right here.	Duk wannan dama a nan.
So now we know what happened.	Don haka yanzu mun san abin da ya faru.
I feel the end is coming.	Ina jin karshen yana zuwa.
I was not surprised.	Ban yi mamaki ba.
Unlike last night.	Ba kamar daren jiya ba.
She sat looking ahead.	Ta zauna tana kallon gaba.
He stopped working.	Ya daina aiki.
School will begin next week.	Za a fara makaranta mako mai zuwa.
I am in heaven.	Ina cikin sama.
Otherwise, he would have died.	Ban da haka, tabbas ya mutu.
They go home and eat.	Suna zuwa gida suna cin abinci.
Maybe she doesn't think of them.	Watakila ba ta tunanin su.
From	Daga
I have to do something about it.	Dole ne in yi wani abu game da shi.
And say.	Kuma ka ce .
Leave it at that.	Bar shi a haka.
I try to look good in everything.	Ina ƙoƙarin ganin mai kyau a cikin komai.
That's what we're talking about.	Abin da muke magana a kai ke nan.
I asked her about it today.	Na tambaye ta game da hakan yau.
They are also open, and empty.	Su ma a bude suke, kuma babu komai.
And change them after each use.	Kuma canza su bayan kowane amfani.
Make no mistake about it.	Kada ku yi kuskure game da wannan.
We are the winners.	Mu kuma mu ne masu nasara.
I did not.	Ban yi ba.
They were very helpful.	Sun taimaka sosai.
We are nearby.	Muna nan kusa.
Maybe she'll hate me.	Wataƙila za ta ƙi ni.
She fell to the ground.	Ta fad'a a k'asa.
Do not be afraid.	Kada ku ji tsoro.
However, it turns out that this is not the whole story.	Duk da haka, ya zama cewa ba duka labarin ba ne.
I can pull myself up.	Zan iya cire kaina.
This too must be done.	Wannan ma dole ne a yi.
He should come here early.	Kamata ya yi ya zo nan da wuri.
Everyone is sleeping now.	Kowa ya kara barci yanzu.
She drank all the water.	Gaba daya ta sha ruwa.
I told him so.	Na gaya masa haka.
It took a while.	Ya ɗauki ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
They took me.	Suka tafi da ni.
They rushed very quickly.	Sun yi sauri da sauri.
Just not very happy.	Kawai ba farin ciki sosai ba.
She looked at the rest.	Ta kalli sauran.
Probably the easiest way to travel.	Wataƙila ita ce hanya mafi sauƙi don tafiya.
No, he did not.	A'a, bai yi ba.
The problem is, he does not know what to do.	Matsalar ita ce, bai san abin da zai yi ba.
You have to work on yourself.	Dole ne ku yi aiki akan kanku.
He has no car.	Ba shi da mota.
That is what he knows.	Abin da ya sani ke nan.
He grew up now, really.	Ya girma yanzu, gaskiya.
You did your best.	Kun yi mafi kyau.
This is true today as never before.	Wannan gaskiya ne a yau ba kamar da ba.
He waited for no answer to come.	Ya jira ba amsa ta zo.
Sometimes, it's just a waste of time.	Wani lokaci, bata lokaci ne kawai.
He has to stop.	Dole ya tsaya.
Sign up if you are with me.	Sa hannu idan kuna tare da ni.
They met an unknown man.	Sun hadu da wani mutum da ba a san su ba.
In fact it looks interesting.	A gaskiya yana kama da ban sha'awa.
They said it would not be a problem.	Sun ce ba zai zama matsala ba.
Here is what you have never seen.	Ga abin da ba ku taɓa gani ba.
Let's not hope.	Kada mu fata.
The rest will die with us.	Sauran za su mutu tare da mu.
Children where they are allowed to play outside.	Yara inda aka yarda su yi wasa a waje.
Good for you.	Yayi kyau a gare ku.
You may have heard the story.	Wataƙila kun ji labarin.
Now just go and do it.	Yanzu kawai mu je mu yi.
That is why it is so difficult for us.	Shi ya sa yana da wahala a gare mu.
That looks good.	Hakan yayi kyau gani.
Everything we are going to talk about here.	Duk abin da za mu yi magana a nan.
I get up early every day.	Ina tashi da wuri kowace rana.
Then she laughed.	Sai ta yi dariya.
That's what he heard.	Abin da ya ji kenan.
He did not succeed in this.	Bai yi nasara a wannan ba.
This is where life begins.	A nan ne rayuwa ta fara.
He used the car.	Ya yi amfani da motar.
The timing was really good, honestly.	Lokaci yayi kyau sosai, gaskiya.
She would never let me go alone.	Ba za ta taɓa sa ni in tafi ni kaɗai ba.
Everyone is eating.	Kowa yana cin abinci.
He got up and answered.	Ya tashi ya amsa.
They put it on me.	Suka saka min ita.
They were made to re-enter	An sa su sake shiga
However, you are looking for the truth.	Duk da haka, kuna neman gaskiya.
I can do it if you want.	Zan iya yin shi idan kuna so.
I need to	Ina bukata
We never knew what would happen.	Ba mu taɓa sanin abin da zai faru ba.
It is best to do it on the road.	Zai fi kyau a yi shi a kan hanya.
That person can drink, man.	Wannan mutumin zai iya sha, mutum.
There will be no problem.	Ba za a sami matsala ba.
Here we are all.	Ga mu duka.
I didn't get it, but something is happening.	Ban samu ba, amma wani abu yana faruwa.
If so, this may be the right time to bring it up.	Idan haka ne, wannan na iya zama lokacin da ya dace don kawo shi.
They did not remove anything at the time.	Ba su cire komai ba a lokacin.
If he dies.	Idan ya mutu.
Now you are on your own.	Yanzu kuna kan kanku.
I just want to be a kid.	Ina so kawai in zama yaro.
Maybe I too.	Wataƙila ni ma.
We look forward to hearing from you.	Muna jiran ji daga gare ku.
No they are good.	A'a suna da kyau.
Lunch at home.	Abincin rana a gida.
They do not think of them.	Ba sa tunanin su.
You die when you're done.	Ka mutu idan ka gama.
This is not true here.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane a nan.
She began to admire him.	Ta fara sha'awar shi.
But he had to get out.	Amma dole ya fita.
It hurts.	Ya ji zafi.
I can’t drink from you, though.	Ba zan iya sha daga gare ku ba, ko da yake.
He no longer expected anything from life.	Bai ƙara tsammanin komai daga rayuwa ba.
We went.	Muka tafi.
Who's going to be killed, and how, that's what we're talking about.	Wanda za a kashe, kuma ta yaya, abin da muka yi magana a kai ke nan.
So, you are crying.	Don haka, kuna kuka.
I will prove it.	Zan tabbatar da shi.
He knows this for sure.	Ya san hakan tabbas.
Come together for a walk.	Ku zo tare don tafiya.
Everyone is a little hurt.	Duk yana jin ɗan rauni.
Just a little weak.	Dan rauni kawai.
What a second.	Menene na biyu.
She is used to it now.	Ta saba da shi yanzu.
We can't go anywhere.	Ba za mu iya shiga kowane wuri ba.
I can write like you.	Zan iya rubuta kamar ku.
Man, that's great!	Mutum, hakan yayi kyau!
How it works.	Yadda yake aiki.
No one can help us around.	Babu wanda zai taimake mu a kusa.
I could feel the doorman looking at us.	Ina jin mutumin kofar yana kallon mu.
You say you can't love me.	Ka ce ba za ka iya so na ba.
I'll give you a loan if you want.	Zan baka bashi idan kana so.
So, that's fine.	Don haka, yayi kyau.
I have users and players.	Ina da masu amfani da 'yan wasa.
Go to them.	Je zuwa gare su.
Next up is a great man.	A gaba wani babban mutum ne.
Close it tightly.	Rufe shi sosai.
Just a little bit.	Kadan kawai.
I was right on time!	Na yi daidai akan lokaci!
But here it is.	Amma sai ga shi.
I want to remember.	Ina so in tuna.
I caught him by surprise.	Na kama shi da mamaki.
You are so beautiful.	Kuna da kyau sosai.
You can not get that.	Ba za ku iya samun hakan ba.
He said he was not in trouble.	Yace bai shiga wata matsala ba.
It is truly amazing.	Lallai abin mamaki ne.
And do it seriously.	Kuma yi da gaske.
They are the second, he says.	Su ne na biyu, ya yi magana yana cewa.
It's been three years.	Shekara uku kenan.
It's not about me.	Ba game da ni ba ne.
Some say you are what you eat,	Wasu suna cewa ku ne abin da kuke ci,
We want the time to come as fast as we can.	Muna son lokacin ya zo da sauri kamar yadda za mu iya.
If you wake up tonight, you have it.	Idan kun tashi a daren nan, kuna da shi.
When I called.	Da na yi kira.
It can go unnoticed.	Yana iya tafiya ba tare da nasara ba.
I did not go to school.	Ban je makaranta ba.
Be prepared, he told himself.	A shirya, ya gaya wa kansa.
I can be	Zan iya zama
This is not.	Wannan ba a.
The road came to our door.	Hanyar ta zo kofar mu.
He looked up.	Ya kalli sama.
But it is something we spend a lot of time on.	Amma abu ne da muke bata lokaci mai yawa a kai.
But now, when he needs it most, he can't seem to fight.	Amma yanzu, lokacin da ya fi bukata, kamar ba zai iya yin faɗa ba.
I took myself very seriously.	Na dauki kaina da sanin kai sosai.
This is not a joke.	Wannan ba wasa ba ne.
He knew what was going on.	Ya san abin da ke faruwa.
I should be familiar with this.	Ya kamata in saba da wannan.
I'll talk to them in there, and take it from there.	Zan yi magana da su a ciki, kuma ku ɗauka daga can.
There is now one.	Akwai yanzu daya.
Finish everything.	Ka gama komai.
The next one will not be.	Na gaba ba zai kasance ba.
But when it did, we knew we had to take care.	Amma lokacin da ya yi, mun san cewa mu kula.
Or no, leave more to get.	Ko a'a, bar ƙarin don in samu.
But still it is nothing.	Amma duk da haka ba komai ba ne.
He knows this is there, of course he has.	Ya san wannan yana nan, ba shakka yana da.
This should work.	Wannan yakamata yayi aiki.
So do not fall on your knees.	Don haka kada ka yi kasa a gwiwa.
He likes to walk slowly.	Yana son tafiya a hankali.
I don't like that at all.	Ba na son hakan ko kadan.
He is with us.	Yana tare da mu.
Completely exhausted.	Gaba daya ya gaji.
So off road there.	Don haka a kashe hanya a can.
From today, they can participate.	Tun daga yau, za su iya shiga.
But you are not a child.	Amma ba kai yaro.
Soon you will see everyone.	Nan da nan za ku ga kowa.
I will never say that.	Ba zan taɓa cewa ba.
It was a work however.	Ya kasance aikin duk da haka.
I think that's why everyone loves her.	Ina tsammanin shi ya sa kowa ke son ta.
They are here, they are not here now.	Suna nan, yanzu ba su nan.
And make no mistake.	Kuma kada ku yi kuskure.
If you want things to change then go and change them.	Idan kana son abubuwa su canza ka je ka canza su.
He can run faster than you.	Zai iya gudu fiye da ku.
I don't know what else.	Ban san me kuma ba.
But, she is very worried.	Amma, ta damu sosai.
I went back a little to see where he was.	Na dan koma baya dan ganin inda yake.
And he was just a little fish.	Kuma shi ɗan kifi ne kawai.
There are more people there than usual.	Akwai mutane da yawa a wurin fiye da yadda aka saba.
This is more than anyone needs.	Wannan ya fi kowane mutum bukata.
But then he realized he was wrong.	Amma sai ya gane cewa yayi kuskure.
I want to show you who I really am.	Ina so in nuna muku ainihin ni.
So we need your help, but we will also stand by you.	Don haka muna buƙatar taimakon ku, amma kuma za mu tsaya tare da ku.
He stayed for three months.	Ya zauna wata uku.
Like a lot, in fact.	Kamar da yawa, a gaskiya.
It's the only way people can do it.	Ita ce kawai hanyar da mutane za su iya yin ta.
I can't talk about that.	Ba zan iya magana game da hakan ba.
And it came to me that maybe this place is the best.	Kuma ya zo gare ni cewa watakila wannan wuri ne mafi kyau.
Whenever it is.	Duk lokacin da yake.
They show us more.	Sun kara nuna mana.
End.	Ƙarshe.
.	.
That is not easy, let me tell you.	Hakan bai da sauƙi, bari in gaya muku.
I use work.	Ina amfani da aiki.
She did not know when she would end up.	Bata san lokacin da ta kare ba.
But we do not know that.	Amma ba mu san hakan ba.
I can turn it on or off.	Zan iya kunna ko kashe shi.
We're sorry.	Mu yi hakuri.
They are asleep.	Sun yi barci.
He does not eat at home.	Ba ya cin abinci a gida.
Enough is enough.	Ya isa ya isa.
Or we all.	Ko mu duka.
Where is the world?	Ina duniya take?
The sooner you do it, the better.	Da sauri ka yi shi, mafi kyau.
Without a shirt.	Ba tare da riga ba.
Is this what is happening to us now.	Shin wannan ne yake faruwa da mu yanzu.
You can see they are beginning to realize it.	Kuna iya ganin su sun fara gane hakan.
I feel very low.	Na ji kasa sosai.
He could not reach his head.	Ya kasa kai kan sa.
So, they can see them too.	Don haka, su ma suna iya ganin su.
And meet him.	Kuma ku hadu da shi.
The ceremony was beautiful.	Bikin yayi kyau.
But there are other pitfalls.	Amma akwai kuma wasu rashin jin daɗi.
Play all your favorite things from yesterday to today.	Kunna duk abubuwan da kuka fi so daga jiya zuwa yau.
Please stop talking, you two.	Don Allah a daina magana, ku biyu.
The earlier in the project and the more often, the better.	Da farko a cikin aikin kuma mafi sau da yawa, mafi kyau.
But now the others have joined him.	Amma yanzu sauran su ma suka shiga gaba da shi.
I think that's good and they even saw it.	Ina tsammanin hakan yana da kyau har ma sun ga hakan.
Another boy took over.	Wani yaro ya dauka.
But you know it happens.	Amma ka san yana faruwa.
The book put me to sleep.	Littafin ya sa ni barci.
I did not go back.	Ban koma baya ba.
They have me and they know it.	Suna da ni kuma sun san shi.
That is a good thing.	Hakan yana da kyau.
You will have time.	Za ku sami lokaci.
Don't worry about it, it will be fine.	Kar ka damu da shi, zai yi kyau.
She will be fine now.	Za ta yi kyau yanzu.
And it's delicious.	Kuma yana da dadi.
Later, after.	Daga baya, bayan.
It's hot here, in the afternoon.	Yana da zafi a nan, da rana.
Now the interesting thing is that he really proved it.	Yanzu abin ban sha'awa shine cewa da gaske ya tabbatar da hakan.
Watching it, it's a close game.	Kallon shi, wasa ne na kusa.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Without breaking them well.	Ba tare da karya su da kyau ba.
I catch him in the same outfit every time we meet.	Ina kama shi a cikin irin wannan kayan a duk lokacin da muka hadu.
No, not great.	A'a, ba girma ba.
It happens, man.	Yana faruwa, mutum.
I see in it.	Ina gani a ciki.
He was very smart.	Ya kasance mai hankali sosai.
We are not there.	Ba mu can.
It can be interesting.	Yana iya zama mai ban sha'awa.
Look out!	Yi hankali!
Do not use more than you want.	Kada ku yi amfani da fiye da yadda kuke so.
You just have to say.	Kai kawai ka fada.
They hope to sell them for more.	Suna fatan za su sayar da su don ƙarin.
I want to forget it.	Ina so in manta da shi.
You know that by now.	Kun san cewa zuwa yanzu.
It happened.	Hakan ya faru.
However, it is difficult to hurry.	Duk da haka, yana da wuya a yi sauri.
He is a complete man.	Wani mutum ne gaba daya.
They continued to travel for years.	Sun ci gaba da tafiya tsawon shekaru.
You will never have the opportunity to travel.	Ba za ku taɓa samun damar yin tafiya ba.
No winner.	Babu mai nasara.
And it will not change.	Kuma ba zai canza ba.
Then the game really started.	Daga nan aka fara wasan gaske.
You have a lot of money.	Kuna da kuɗi da yawa.
I like that.	Ina son hakan.
Help to make them easier.	Taimaka don sanya su cikin sauƙi.
She just felt so good.	Ta dan ji dadi haka.
We have no clue why.	Ba mu da wata alama ta sa.
There is nothing to do.	Babu wani abu da za a yi.
Almost here, sorry.	Kusan nan, hakuri.
And they may not get the job done.	Kuma watakila ba za su kai ga aikin ba.
Fix it in two days.	Gyara shi cikin kwana biyu.
He didn't speak when she gave me the shirt.	Bai yi magana ba lokacin da ta ba ni rigar.
She will not be afraid.	Ba za ta ji tsoro ba.
I did not hear anything from them.	Ban ji komai daga gare su ba.
Somewhere he somehow had to write something about everything.	Wani wuri ko ta yaya dole ne ya rubuta wani abu game da duk abin da ke wani abu.
We got good.	Mun samu mai kyau.
Try it out.	Gwada mata.
I can not say it is.	Ba zan iya cewa yana da.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
It is good to do the same.	Yana da kyau ya yi hakan ma.
I know when it started.	Na san lokacin da ta fara.
We wrote the first one.	Mun rubuta na farko guda.
Not the place I would like to be.	Ba wurin da zan so zama ba.
They began to eat.	Suka fara ci.
He wants to pay.	Yana so ya biya.
I said they didn't because they couldn't.	Na ce ba su yi ba saboda ba za su iya ba.
Growing up like people.	Girma kamar mutane.
No one will be tired.	Ba wanda zai gaji.
They always think something is better.	Kullum suna tunanin wani abu ya fi kyau.
The celebration was amazing.	Bikin ya yi ban mamaki.
That was in the past.	Wannan ya kasance a baya.
Now she will come to love her.	Yanzu za ta zo son ta.
You must go looking for them.	Dole ne ku je neman su.
We can't pay.	Ba za mu iya biya ba.
She is a human being.	Ita mutum ce.
Who would want after what he did.	Wanene zai so bayan abin da ya yi.
It will not work.	Ba zai yi aiki ba.
That can be difficult.	Hakan na iya zama da wahala.
She tried it.	Ta gwada shi.
I got help with kids definitely.	Na sami taimako tare da yara tabbas.
When he returned, he told her everything.	Bayan ya dawo ya gaya mata komai.
We have never been as good as we were at the time.	Ba mu taɓa yin kyau kamar yadda muke a lokacin ba.
I'm not sure why.	Ban tabbata dalilin hakan ba.
Now, today, we know that this is not true.	Yanzu, a yau, mun san cewa wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
I will explain it to you later.	Zan bayyana muku shi a gaba.
These are not the only ones though.	Ba waɗannan kaɗai ba ne ko da yake.
And sadly.	Kuma abin bakin ciki.
But you know this.	Amma ku san wannan.
Save time and money.	Ajiye lokaci da kuɗi.
Do whatever you want.	Yi duk abin da kuke so.
It is better to leave the house.	Yana da kyau fita daga gidan.
Who else feels that way?	Wanene kuma yake jin haka?.
I will do anything for you if you want.	Zan yi maka komai idan za ka so.
Fatty foods make you fat.	Abincin mai mai yana sa ku mai.
Maybe now he can just.	Watakila yanzu zai iya kawai .
Tell off.	A gaya kashe.
That lasted a long time.	Hakan ya dade.
If you can keep up, well done.	Idan za ku iya ci gaba, da kyau da kyau.
All of this will cost money.	Duk waɗannan za su ci kuɗi.
He may have been there for a week.	Wataƙila ya kasance a wurin har tsawon mako guda.
It is better not to go out at night.	Gara kada ku fita cikin dare.
But maybe you are right.	Amma watakila kana da gaskiya.
We will work during the week.	Za mu yi aiki a cikin mako.
He even told me the day we met.	Har ma ya ce min a ranar da muka hadu.
He saw this man too.	Ya ga mutumin nan ma.
I could never explain it.	Ban taba iya bayyana shi ba.
He used them.	Ya yi amfani da su.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
And I am not alone.	Kuma ba ni kadai ba.
You have to be careful about what you eat.	Dole ne ku kula da abin da kuke ci.
It's good to come.	Yana da kyau ka zo.
We have to ask him.	Dole ne mu tambaye shi.
He said nothing.	Bai ce komai ba.
She wants to be alone.	Tana son zama ita kaɗai.
It has not worked since.	Tun daga nan bai yi aiki ba.
We must make sure that we are well prepared.	Dole ne mu tabbatar da cewa mun shirya sosai.
But just a fix for the program.	Amma kawai gyara ga shirin.
It could be me.	Zai iya zama ni.
Sometimes things don't work out.	Wani lokaci abubuwa ba sa aiki.
Come on, kids.	Ku zo, yara.
I knew him at the time.	Na san shi a lokacin.
It would have been more enjoyable.	Da ya zama yana ƙara jin daɗi.
He travels a lot and is always absent.	Yana tafiya da yawa kuma kullum ba ya nan.
Happiness spread rapidly.	Farin ciki ya fad'a da sauri.
Yet this is absurd.	Amma duk da haka wannan rashin hankali ne.
From the water life comes.	Daga ruwa rai ke zuwa.
And it will not be easy.	Kuma ba zai zama mai sauƙi ba.
But as things are now.	Amma kamar yadda abubuwa suke a yanzu.
I will not answer, not now.	Ba zan amsa ba, ba yanzu ba.
She can write at home.	Ta iya rubuta gida.
They had it, they released it.	Suna da shi, suka sake shi.
Or talk to everyone.	Ko magana da kowa.
He was there.	Ya kasance a wurin.
There is no doubt about it.	Babu shakka game da shi.
Little by little.	Dan kadan kadan.
But there is nothing we can do.	Amma babu abin da za mu iya yi.
This must be	Wannan dole ne a
Now we must find someone to do them.	Yanzu dole ne mu sami wanda zai yi su.
Water is not like water.	Ruwa ba ya zama kamar ruwa.
I see you have lost trust in me.	Na ga ka rasa yarda da ni.
Come now, tell us your story.	Zo yanzu, gaya mana labarin ku.
I'm sure you heard.	Na tabbata kun ji.
He slept more.	Ya kara kwana yana barci.
That will never happen, of course.	Hakan ba zai taba faruwa ba, ba shakka.
He cries a lot.	Yayi kuka sosai.
Not enough sleep.	Bata isa barci ba.
Did you see? 	Ka gani?
He said.	Yace.
But by the way.	Amma ta hanyar.
Now, time has changed.	Yanzu, lokaci ya canza.
He seems to have forgotten where he is in the story.	Kamar ya manta inda yake a cikin labarin.
You are amazing.	Kuna da ban mamaki.
Now move on.	Yanzu ci gaba.
Do not let it get cold.	Kar a bar shi yayi sanyi.
Only one person.	Mutum daya ne kawai.
I had to make my own home.	Dole na yi wa kaina gida.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane.
I didn’t and I stayed.	Ban yi ba kuma na zauna.
Not so, of course.	Ba haka yake ba, ba shakka.
It will take from here.	Zata dauka daga nan.
It seemed like something gave way.	Ya bayyana kamar wani abu ya ba da hanya.
Due to some unknown factors.	Saboda wasu abubuwan da ba a sani ba.
He could not help himself.	Ba zai iya taimakon kansa ba.
I want to be that person.	Ina so in zama wannan mutumin.
Please do not run.	Don Allah kar a gudu.
When he came to earth.	Lokacin da ya zo duniya.
Everything was fine last night.	Komai ya yi kyau a daren jiya.
However, nothing happened.	Duk da haka, babu wani abu da ya faru.
Or maybe not.	Ko watakila a'a.
If you want something, work on it.	Idan kana son wani abu, yi aiki da shi.
After she went outside as usual.	Bayan ta fita waje kamar kullum.
Tell me, you will be happy.	Faɗa mini, za ku ji daɗi.
It is easy for them.	Yana da sauƙi a gare su.
It's more than walking.	Ya fi tafiya.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
You made it.	Ka sanya shi.
This will not work for you.	Wannan ba zai yi muku kyau ba.
There is no need for that.	Babu bukatar hakan.
I tried that.	Na gwada hakan.
This is my train.	Jirgin kasa na kenan.
We will tell you when we plan a trip.	Za mu gaya muku lokacin da muka shirya tafiya.
What they are doing is huge.	Abin da suke yi yana da girma.
It would have been even more difficult.	Da ma ya fi wahala.
I did, too, first.	Na yi, kuma, da farko.
But she let it pass.	Amma ta bari ta wuce.
He didn't really care.	Bai kula sosai ba.
Many were.	Da yawa sun kasance.
Money, money, money!	Kudi, kudi, kudi!
I have never won it.	Ban taba cin nasara da shi ba.
And it is not surprising.	Kuma ba abin mamaki ba ne.
Not life for you.	Ba rayuwa a gare ku ba.
You should try it !.	Ya kamata ku gwada!.
He is my son.	Shi yaro na ne.
That is not fair.	Hakan bai dace ba.
This will not work.	Wannan ba zai yi aiki ba.
It's just a big house.	Babban gida ne kawai.
He really loves it.	Yana matukar son sa.
And we will make it work.	Kuma za mu sanya shi aiki.
We walked in the morning.	Mun yi tafiya da safe.
He could not eat, he could not stop crying.	Ya kasa cin abinci, ya kasa daina kuka.
And he will know where.	Kuma zai san inda.
Let's hope he does.	Bari mu yi fatan zai yi haka.
But that is not the end.	Amma wannan ba shine karshen ba.
And everyone wanted to go to dinner.	Kuma kowa ya so ya je cin abincin dare.
That is better.	Hakan ya fi kyau.
He wants to cry.	Yana son yin kuka.
And that is the story.	Kuma wannan shine labarin.
Yet no one pretended to know.	Amma duk da haka babu wanda ya yi kamar ya san shi.
I'm not ready.	Ban shirya ba.
She knew nothing.	Ba ta san komai ba.
Maybe it's a good thing.	Wataƙila abu ne mai kyau.
But things have changed in the world.	Amma abubuwa sun canza a duniya.
This is the third.	Wannan ya zama na uku.
And it's all the same.	Kuma gaba ɗaya ɗaya ne.
It is still there.	Yana nan har yanzu.
Something new appeared.	Wani sabon abu ya bayyana.
Taking to understand the name.	Shan gane sunan.
The one who is not very good.	Wanda bai kai sosai ba.
You can only imagine.	Kuna iya tunanin kawai.
But she can think of many others.	Amma tana iya tunanin wasu da yawa.
He could never get anything beyond it.	Ba zai taba iya samun wani abu ya wuce ta ba.
Now she has added three cups of water.	Yanzu ta kara ruwa kofi uku.
But we are happy to have her.	Amma mun yi farin ciki da samun ta.
We can talk about it later.	Za mu iya magana game da shi daga baya.
Come, let's drink it.	Zo, za mu sha shi.
Open it and you're good to go.	Bude shi kuma kuna da kyau ku tafi.
They do not get them.	Ba sa samun su.
This restaurant offers delicious food.	Wannan gidan abinci yana ba da abinci mai daɗi.
Buy it, or you won't.	Sayi shi, ko ba za ku cika ba.
Everyone thought it was really good.	Kowa ya dauka yana da kyau sosai.
He had to do two more things.	Dole ya sake yin abubuwa biyu.
Beat it.	Duka shi.
He never heard the name.	Bai taba jin sunan ba.
I heard about this in the morning.	Na ji labarin wannan da safe.
Sitting on the floor.	Zaune a kasa.
I do not know what to say to her.	Ban san me zan gaya mata ba.
There is, of course, similarity.	Akwai, ba shakka, kama.
It did not bother me.	Bai yi mani hankali ba.
We were very surprised by this.	Mun yi matukar mamakin wannan.
Take this, all of you, and eat.	Ku ɗauki wannan, ku duka, ku ci.
A lot of time has passed.	Lokaci da yawa ya wuce.
And not now.	Kuma ba yanzu ba.
I'm dead too.	na mutu kuma .
Not right.	Ba dama ba ne.
I'll call you later.	Zan kira ka daga baya.
Kind of beautiful.	Irin kyau.
I'm sure you are not overly helpful.	Na tabbata ba ku wuce taimako ba.
Not on one person.	Ba akan mutum ɗaya ba.
I will never let you go.	Ba zan taɓa barin ku ku tafi ba.
It was funny he didn't see the kids on the road.	Abin dariya ne bai ga yara a hanya ba.
You did not do well.	Ba ku yi kyau ba.
It is said to be the best there.	An ce shi ne mafi kyau a can.
There was no way we could get married then.	Babu yadda za a yi mu yi aure a lokacin.
Start here.	Fara a nan.
She knows that now.	Ta san haka yanzu.
I will try to change, ladies.	Zan yi ƙoƙari in canza, mata.
But they paid well and on time.	Amma sun biya da kyau kuma akan lokaci.
You only get three in each game.	Kuna samun uku kawai a kowane wasa.
She passed.	Ta wuce.
He knows when it is time to move on.	Ya san lokacin tafiya yayi.
So somewhere must be found.	Don haka dole ne a sami wani wuri.
I agree with you.	Na yarda da ku.
I see this to be true.	Na ga wannan gaskiya ne.
Almost selling it.	Kusan sayar da shi.
That they do so much and so little is surprising.	Cewa suna yin da yawa da kaɗan abin mamaki ne.
I'll wait outside.	Zan jira waje.
Honestly, we’re not talking about anything really.	A gaskiya, ba mu magana game da wani abu sosai.
The fear passed.	Tsoro ya wuce.
She gets up and sits down and the ceremony begins.	Ta tashi zaune ana fara bikin.
No one expected that to happen.	Ba wanda yake tsammanin hakan zai faru.
This is nothing.	Wannan ba komai ba ne.
It made sense to me.	Ya yi mani hankali.
But I am, and everyone like me, wants to get it.	Amma ni ne, kuma kowa kamar ni, suna so su samu.
And they want me to be with them.	Kuma suna so na tare da su.
They take care of me.	Suna kula da ni.
No one has been seen for over thirty years.	Ba a ga kowa ba sama da shekaru talatin.
We do not want to be in the sun.	Ba ma so mu kasance a cikin rana.
That seems to help.	Hakan ya zama kamar ya taimaka.
You have to pay.	Dole ne ku biya.
Drink this, and you will be well.	Ka sha wannan, ka samu lafiya.
You see it is easy.	Ka ga yana da sauƙi.
He became the owner happy for more help.	Sai ya zama mai shi ya yi farin ciki don ƙarin taimako.
But we did that three years ago.	Amma mun yi haka shekaru uku da suka wuce.
He was a great reader.	Ya kasance mai yawan karatu.
I hope it will be later.	Ina fatan zai kasance a baya.
But we understand it.	Amma mun gane shi.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu ya faru ba daidai ba.
But he failed.	Amma ya kasa.
We can put this behind us and move on.	Za mu iya ajiye wannan a baya mu kuma ci gaba.
Don't be careful.	Kada ku yi hankali.
He had to find her.	Sai da ya sami mata.
The first was brought.	Aka kawo na farko.
Then she heard everything again.	Sai ta sake jin komai.
It's hard.	Ya yi wuya.
However, the addict.	Duk da haka, mai ƙara.
So it is said.	Don haka ake cewa.
She was crying and doing something for her.	Kuka take tana yi mata wani abu.
So check it out.	Don haka a duba.
I think it's really good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau sosai.
They will never let you stop.	Ba za su taba bari ka tsaya ba.
Maybe you are one.	Wataƙila kuna ɗaya ne.
But he understood things.	Amma ya fahimci abubuwa.
He had to think.	Sai da yayi tunani.
Hope this helped !.	Da fatan wannan ya taimaka!.
Sometimes, it can get a little busy, though.	Wani lokaci, yana iya samun ɗan aiki, ko da yake.
So far few people are aware of this.	Har ya zuwa yanzu mutane kadan ne suka fahimci hakan.
And they will not worry.	Kuma ba za su damu ba.
I think we should do it.	Na ga ya kamata mu yi.
She stopped smoking.	Ta daina shan taba.
Thoughts hurt.	Tunani yayi zafi.
You are actually saying.	Ainihin kuna cewa.
But now we know why.	Amma yanzu mun san dalilin.
This is why sometimes you just feel sad.	Wannan shine dalilin da ya sa wani lokaci kuna jin bakin ciki kawai.
The only thing we can do now is wait.	Abin da kawai za mu iya yi a yanzu shi ne jira.
I did not say much.	Ban ce da yawa ba.
That was difficult.	Hakan ya yi wuya.
There is no mistake.	Babu wurin kuskure.
Stay home from work or school if you are not well.	Tsaya gida daga aiki ko makaranta idan ba ku da lafiya.
When she comes.	Lokacin da ta zo.
You have a wonderful time with the kids.	Kuna da ban mamaki tare da yara.
Before they do that.	Kafin su yi haka.
We are all about winning.	Mu duka game da yin nasara ne.
He felt there were two more times.	Ya ji akwai sau biyu da yawa.
She knows such things.	Ta san irin waɗannan abubuwa.
Success, however, is uncertain.	Nasara, duk da haka, ba ta da tabbas.
But no one is around, it seems.	Amma babu kowa a kusa, da alama.
I want to see the game happen.	Ina so in ga wasan ya faru.
This is to fix things.	Wannan shi ne don gyara abubuwa.
Drinking too much.	Shan da yawa.
I really don't want to do it.	A gaskiya ba na son yin shi.
Come have dinner.	Ku zo cin abincin dare.
It's good for me.	Yana da kyau a gare ni.
They do not need much water.	Ba sa buƙatar ruwa mai yawa.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
But here he goes.	Amma a nan ya tafi.
This is now.	Wannan shi ne yanzu.
They can be hot to work with.	Suna iya zama zafi don aiki tare da.
You are very close to him.	Kun kusa kusa da shi.
Next year it will be thirty.	A shekara mai zuwa zai zama talatin.
Very interesting in the program.	Mai ban sha'awa sosai a cikin shirin.
Can he do better.	Shin zai iya yin kyau.
We still haven't done that.	Har yanzu ba mu yi haka ba.
It does not have to cost you any money.	Ba dole ba ne ya kashe maka wani kuɗi.
Very successful.	Mai nasara sosai.
It can be accessed from the front.	Ana iya samun dama daga gaba.
Like any other way you want to activate this.	Kamar kowace hanya kuna son kunna wannan.
I want them to be in the moment.	Ina son su kasance a cikin lokacin.
It will come out.	Zai fito.
Do not forget them.	Kar ka manta da su.
She really showed up.	Ta nuna da gaske.
He found out.	Ya gano .
It tastes as good as it tastes.	Yana da dadi kamar yadda yake.
Otherwise, it is too late.	Ban da haka, ya makara.
Everyone heard it.	Kowa ya ji shi.
From the moment we arrived we were taken care of.	Tun daga lokacin da muka isa ana kula da mu da gaske.
He would like someone to help him there.	Zai so wanda zai taimake shi a can.
I never thought about it so hard.	Ban taba tunani game da shi da wuya ba.
I do not think it will be so difficult.	Ba na jin zai yi wuya haka.
At first it was delicious.	Da farko yana da dadi.
He really likes this project.	Yana son wannan aikin da gaske.
I can say that because it is true.	Zan iya cewa saboda gaskiya ne.
Great surprise.	Babban abin mamaki.
Work has continued, though.	An ci gaba da aiki, ko da yake.
I do not know what to think.	Ban san me zan yi tunani ba.
Everything is going well.	Komai yana tafiya da kyau.
I do not have time for anyone.	Bani da lokacin kowa.
I think life has been wonderful.	Ina tsammanin rayuwa ta zama abin ban mamaki.
This is the best food we have ever eaten.	Wannan shine mafi kyawun abinci da muka taɓa ci.
Not failed.	Ba a kasa ba.
He was and is all there together.	Ya kasance kuma yana can duk tare.
Although he was not injured.	Ko da yake bai ji rauni ba.
I have seen others.	Na ga wasu kuma.
But this is only outside.	Amma wannan a waje ne kawai.
It is not good to just do each other.	Ba kyau a yi juna kawai.
Maybe he thought so.	Wataƙila ya yi tunanin haka.
She made no mistake.	Ba ta yi kuskure ba.
No answer.	Babu amsa.
Few of us were there.	Kadan daga cikin mu sun kasance a can.
We are ready when you are.	Mun shirya lokacin da kuke.
You can have another.	Kuna iya samun wani.
The water is cold.	Ruwan yayi sanyi.
That's sad.	Abin bakin ciki ke nan.
I think he must have been ill for a long time.	Ina ganin tabbas ya dade yana rashin lafiya.
Likewise, with people.	Haka kuma, tare da mutane.
I don't even remember what happened.	Ban ma tuna abin da aka yi.
Just leave it at that.	Bar shi kawai.
At home	A gida
I can't go out like that.	Ba zan iya fita haka ba.
I will enter this house.	Zan shiga wannan gidan.
There he sat worried.	Nan ya zauna ya damu.
We gave them everything.	Mun ba su komai.
How much do you still see?	Har yanzu kuna ganin nawa?.
They are not alive.	Ba su da rai.
Or one by train and one by boat.	Ko kuma daya ta jirgin kasa daya kuma ta jirgin ruwa.
Only with me will you die.	Tare da ni kawai za ku mutu.
The cause is still unknown.	Har yanzu ba a san dalilin da ya sa ba.
Put things first.	Sanya abubuwa farko a gaba.
We will proceed slowly.	Za mu ci gaba a hankali.
So we prepared.	Don haka muka shirya.
Now, slowly.	Yanzu, a hankali.
You have talked to her before.	Kun yi magana da ita a baya.
We have each other.	Muna da juna.
Things happen very fast.	Abubuwa suna faruwa da sauri.
Whatever we worked for.	Duk abin da muka yi aiki don.
You may or may not agree.	Kuna iya yarda ko rashin yarda.
No, not less.	A'a, ba kasa ba.
We will also ask children or others to sing.	Za mu kuma nemi yara ko wasu su yi waƙa.
There is an error.	Akwai kuskure.
Do you want me to go out?	Kuna so in fita.
I'm so, so sorry.	Ina haka, don haka hakuri.
I began to feel.	Na fara ji.
More articles must be found.	Dole ne a sami ƙarin labarin.
I told him that earlier.	Na gaya masa cewa tun farko.
I never got up.	Ban taɓa tashi ba.
Now one thing.	Yanzu abu daya.
He does not participate in any game.	Ba ya shiga kowane wasa.
With food.	Tare da abinci.
Play safe.	Yi wasa lafiya.
And it doesn’t have to be all about money.	Kuma ba dole ne komai ya kasance game da kuɗi ba.
But it is not even mentioned.	Amma ba a ma magana a kai.
I do not know how to start a conversation.	Ban san yadda zan fara magana ba.
This may explain his inaction.	Wannan na iya bayyana rashin aikin sa.
Where is she going?	Ina zata je?
I always thought that was good.	A koyaushe ina tsammanin hakan yana da kyau.
If that were true.	Idan da hakan gaskiya ne.
I watched the game last night.	Na kalli wasan a daren jiya.
It takes such a moment.	Yana ɗaukar irin wannan lokacin.
He loves the game.	Yana son wasan.
But really from.	Amma da gaske daga.
They have seen it too.	Su ma sun gani.
They can walk.	Suna iya tafiya.
I do not know what to expect.	Ban san abin da zan jira ba.
If anyone needs to cry, let them.	Idan wani yana buƙatar kuka, bari su.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
What you have described is interesting.	Abin da kuka bayyana yana da ban sha'awa.
Tell him to play.	Ka gaya masa ya yi wasa.
What in the world do you do?	Me kuke yi a duniya?
Gradually she realized that there was a problem.	A hankali ta gane cewa akwai matsala.
I see you in this more than you do.	Na fi ku gani a cikin wannan fiye da ku.
He is an athlete.	Dan wasa ne.
Think of it this way.	Ka yi tunanin wannan hanyar.
I feel good about it.	Ina jin dadi game da shi.
We continue to live right.	Mun ci gaba da rayuwa daidai.
I don't know what to do about it.	Ban san abin da zan yi game da hakan ba.
Next, get some people to try it out.	Na gaba, sa wasu mutane su gwada shi.
So we will not leave her either.	Don haka mu ma ba za mu bar ta ba.
Please bring it back tomorrow.	Da fatan a dawo da shi gobe.
There are three of us.	Mu uku ne.
Which maybe will.	Wanda watakila zai yi.
Do not die with it unfinished.	Kada ku mutu da shi ba a gama ba.
But there is nothing you can do.	Amma babu abin da za ku iya yi.
Play for real money.	Yi wasa don kuɗi na gaske.
It doesn't matter where you put it.	Ba komai a ina ka sa shi.
She too.	Ita ma.
As the next one does.	Kamar yadda na gaba yayi.
Not because they want to, but because they have to.	Ba don suna so ba, amma saboda dole ne su yi.
I acted like I didn’t understand.	Na yi kamar ban gane ba.
It has never been turned on, or seen to be written.	Ba a taɓa kunna shi ba, ko ganin an rubuta shi.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Better put it.	Gara sanya shi.
But still he ran.	Amma duk da haka ya gudu.
Very interesting.	Sosai sha'awa.
There are many.	Akwai su da yawa.
Next little.	Na gaba kadan.
We still do not know.	Har yanzu ba mu sani ba.
Make the task at hand work.	Sanya aikin da aka ɗauka yayi aiki.
And there is nothing we can do.	Kuma babu abin da za mu yi.
Everyone understands one thing.	Kowa ya fahimci abu daya.
If we travel, fine.	Idan muka yi tafiya, lafiya.
If you need anything.	Idan kana bukatar wani abu .
She was ready, he knew.	Ta shirya, ya sani.
Talk about scary.	Yi magana game da ban tsoro.
Run with surprise.	Gudu da mamaki.
If they love them, you too.	Idan suna son su, ku ma.
This will wait.	Wannan zai jira.
There is little to see.	Akwai kaɗan don gani.
We talked earlier.	Mun yi magana a baya.
I can tell.	Zan iya fada.
He kept coming.	Ya ci gaba da zuwa.
They accused him of not playing.	Sun yi zargin rashin wasa.
We must do this now.	Dole ne mu yi wannan a yanzu.
I want a chance to live again at this point.	Ina son damar sake rayuwa a wannan lokacin.
I want to see them grow.	Ina so in ga sun girma.
God, he grew up to be a good man.	Allah, yana girma ya zama kyakkyawan mutum.
However, we did not do a bad job.	Duk da haka, ba mu yi mummunan aiki ba.
I like doing things.	Ina son yin abubuwa.
I heard a lot of good things about it.	Na ji abubuwa masu kyau da yawa game da shi.
He was interested.	Ya yi sha'awar.
We have not yet made that decision.	Har yanzu ba mu yanke wannan shawarar ba.
It is your job too.	Aikin ku ne ma.
Here is everything that has been in the past.	Ga duk abin da ya kasance a da.
There is nothing in it and nothing.	Babu komai a ciki kuma ba komai.
I had to check them out at the same time.	Dole ne in duba su lokaci guda.
There is a drink.	Akwai abin sha.
I am known for making a name for things like this.	An san ni da yin suna don abubuwa irin wannan.
It looks like it's done well.	Ga alama an yi shi da kyau.
This is doing the job right.	Wannan yana yin aikin daidai.
I was terrified.	Na kasance mai ban tsoro.
This is not just rain.	Wannan da bai wuce ruwan sama kawai ba.
And come to know.	Kuma ya zo ka sani.
I think this was a little quicker, though.	Ina tsammanin wannan ya ɗan yi sauri, ko da yake.
Maybe we should be honest and forget it altogether.	Wataƙila ya kamata mu kasance masu gaskiya kuma mu manta da shi gaba ɗaya.
Honestly I don't remember.	Gaskiya ban tuna ba.
He knows the place.	Ya san wurin.
Let it grow.	Bari ya girma.
No one can do anything.	Babu wanda zai iya yin komai.
I lost everything because of it.	Na rasa komai saboda shi.
I enjoyed today.	Na ji daɗi a yau.
It lasted a week, maybe two.	Ya wuce mako guda, watakila biyu.
She has nowhere to put it.	Bata da inda zata saka ta.
Hope you find it useful.	Da fatan za ku sami amfani.
The kind of thing that must stop now.	Irin abin da dole ne a daina yanzu.
School supplies must be changed monthly.	Dole ne a canza kayan makaranta kowane wata.
Last time.	Lokaci na ƙarshe.
He could not eat dinner.	Ya kasa cin abincin dare.
Expect this to be for tonight only.	Tsammanin wannan don daren yau ne kawai.
There is something there now.	Akwai wani abu a wurin yanzu.
She had never heard anyone say that.	Ba ta taba jin wani ya ce haka ba.
Simply, the man is not dead.	Kawai, mutumin bai mutu ba.
He found out he didn’t need to work.	Ya gano ba ya bukatar yin aiki.
They want to stay safe.	Sun so su zauna lafiya.
He immediately bought a house, which he still lives in.	Nan da nan ya sayi gida, wanda har yanzu yana zaune a ciki.
He heard the doctor talking.	Ya ji likitan yana magana.
We want to hear from you.	Muna son ji daga gare ku.
Which movie will you see tonight?	Wane fim za ku gani a daren nan?
It happens more than you want to know.	Yana faruwa fiye da yadda kuke son sani.
I didn't have to look for anything.	Ba sai na nemi komai ba.
There is nothing he can do for her, yet.	Babu abin da zai iya yi mata, har yanzu.
That sounds good.	Hakan yayi kyau.
Write down your thoughts.	Rubuta tunanin ku.
I'm not sure if that is the case.	Ban tabbata ko wannan shine dalilin ba.
It is very difficult to change or repair it.	Yana da matukar wahala a canza ko gyara shi.
He failed to do that.	Ya kasa da cewa.
I'll show him inside.	Zan nuna masa a ciki.
But she says they are not.	Amma ta ce ba haka suke ba.
I read that.	Na karanta cewa.
However progress has been slow.	Duk da haka ci gaba ya kasance a hankali.
We can agree on one thing.	Za mu iya yarda a kan abu daya.
And in fact she too.	Kuma a gaskiya ita ma.
She heard that.	Ta ji haka.
Please let me know exactly what you said.	Da fatan za a gaya mani daidai abin da kuka fada.
Just fear.	Tsoro kawai.
Let it cool a bit.	Bari yayi sanyi kadan.
He went back to the real fight.	Ya koma fada na gaske.
This is scary.	Wannan yana da ban tsoro.
I think it's a good thing.	Ina ganin abu ne mai kyau.
We eat, we drink, and sometimes we talk.	Muna ci, muna sha, wani lokacin ma, muna magana.
If you do well, you will feel your best.	Idan kun yi kyau, za ku ji mafi kyawun ku.
There must be a better way to find out where they are.	Dole ne a sami hanya mafi kyau don gano inda suke.
She has a good idea, she said.	Tana da kyakkyawan tunani, in ji ta.
Think they will be bigger.	Yi tunanin za su fi girma.
Life has changed.	Rayuwa ta canza.
It was not so.	Ba haka ta kasance ba.
They will do something good for you there.	Za su yi muku wani abu mai kyau a can.
Which was horrible.	Wanda ya zama abin ban tsoro.
We are ready for it.	Mun shirya don shi.
And you think.	Kuma kuna tunani.
Not difficult.	Ba wahala ba.
They really want you to want to work there and have fun.	Suna son ku da gaske ku so yin aiki a wurin kuma ku yi farin ciki.
How many women ?.	Mata nawa?.
I do not really want to.	Ba na so da gaske.
I miss.	Na rasa.
Not for heat, but for fear.	Ba don zafi ba, amma don tsoro.
Many died.	Da yawa sun mutu.
It's good.	Yana da kyau.
I sat down, he stopped.	Na zauna, ya tsaya.
He was down but he didn't care.	K'asa yake yi amma bai damu ba.
Or myself so.	Ko ni kaina don haka.
Until last night, we did not talk for many years.	Har daren jiya, ba mu yi magana shekaru da yawa ba.
People have amazing intelligence.	Mutane suna da hankali na ban mamaki.
Good job with that.	Kyakkyawan aiki tare da wannan.
He studied hard but failed.	Yayi karatu sosai amma ya kasa kasa.
We do not know what they want.	Ba mu san abin da suke so ba.
My beautiful home.	Kyakkyawan gida na.
We did.	Mun yi koyi da shi.
As for the event, it must have looked like that.	Amma ga taron, tabbas ya yi kama da haka.
Stay with us, everyone.	Ku zauna da mu, kowa da kowa.
She was fine, he thought.	Ta yi kyau, ya yi tunani.
This is about it though.	Wannan shi ne game da shi ko da yake.
We will take everyone.	Za mu dauki kowa.
We can apply to participate in the program.	Za mu iya neman shiga cikin shirin.
I never read it.	Ban taba karanta shi ba.
You have to do it yourself.	Dole ne ku yi shi da kanku.
He did not do it for us to understand.	Bai yi mana ba don mu gane.
After that he returned to normal.	Bayan haka ya koma yadda ya dace.
We have to run now.	Dole ne mu gudu yanzu.
Really good, too, for a while.	Kyakkyawan gaske, kuma, na ɗan lokaci.
The story is nothing.	Labarin ba komai ba ne.
He moved closer to her.	Ya koma kusa da ita.
It's not fast enough.	Bai isa da sauri ba.
It’s the same time, though.	Lokaci guda ne, ko da yake.
Have a nice weekend.	Yi kyakkyawan karshen mako.
A very intelligent man.	Mutum mai hankali sosai.
Show him a way.	Nuna masa wata hanya.
These don’t, but they get better and better, and that’s fun.	Waɗannan ba su yi ba, amma suna samun kyau kuma suna da kyau, kuma hakan yana da daɗi.
But that is not fair.	Amma hakan bai dace ba.
We have to stop now.	Dole mu tsaya yanzu.
Two people died here.	Mutane biyu sun mutu a nan.
Do this now!	Yi wannan yanzu!
She was a thinker.	Ta kasance mai tunani.
The door is a little open.	Kofar ta dan bude.
I want to see how you are.	Ina so in ga yadda kuke.
That's what everyone got.	Haka kowa ya samu.
The car is moving fast.	Motar na tafiya da sauri.
He said he was interested.	Yace yana sha'awa.
It started well.	An fara da kyau.
You can do that.	Kuna iya yin hakan.
See where you bring us.	Kalli inda ka kawo mu.
But it was a fight.	Amma fada ne ya yi.
She felt she could not live without them.	Ta ji ba za ta iya rayuwa ba tare da su ba.
Break them.	Karya su.
He is still right.	Ya kasance daidai har yanzu.
Best done the next day.	Mafi kyawun da aka yi a rana mai zuwa.
People really believe it.	Mutane sun yarda da shi sosai.
He really brought it home.	Da gaske ne ya kawo shi gida.
I prefer to do that.	Na fi yin hakan.
The day has not come.	Ranar bata zo ba.
And it will never be covered.	Kuma ba za a taba rufe shi ba.
You know, a lot of people miss seeing that.	Ka sani, mutane da yawa sun rasa ganin haka.
Either way, it won't happen.	Ko ta yaya, ba zai faru ba.
In life.	A rayuwa.
They have to do that.	Dole ne su yi hakan.
The same thing happened to her.	Haka ya faru da ita.
We have known each other for a long time.	Mun dade da sanin juna.
Or what happened next.	Ko me ya faru daga baya.
It will not rise.	Ba za ta tashi ba.
No one is talking to anyone.	Ba wanda yake magana da wani.
They agreed and set off.	Suka yarda suka fara tafiya gida.
Tonight was a very pleasant day.	Daren yau ya kasance mai daɗi sosai.
We need to talk.	Muna bukatar mu yi magana.
I will not stand by that.	Ba zan tsaya kan hakan ba.
It's not my thing.	Ba abu na bane.
Not everyone at home.	Ba kowa a gida.
This may be more than talk.	Wannan yana iya zama fiye da magana.
It has been a pleasure to work with him for so many years.	Ya kasance abin farin ciki don yin aiki tare da shekaru da yawa.
I can't even talk to you.	Ba zan iya ma yin magana da ku ba.
I feel good about lying.	Ina jin dadi game da karya.
We have made good progress.	Mun samu ci gaba mai kyau.
I need you to work hard.	Ina bukata ku yi aiki da tunani.
I don’t want to do this all the time.	Ba na son yin wannan a kowane lokaci.
Get out of the house.	Fita daga gidan.
But this is not true.	Amma wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Home party, if you will.	Bikin gida, idan kuna so.
He was placed in the room where he was kept with her.	An saka shi a dakin da aka ajiye shi da ita.
But things have changed.	Amma abubuwa sun canza.
He looked at the door.	Ya duba kofar.
This can be a problem.	Wannan na iya zama matsala.
But he always backed down.	Amma kullum sai ya koma baya.
You are making the world a better place.	Kuna sanya duniya wuri mai kyau.
It is nothing new.	Ba sabon abu ba ne.
And beauty makes people happy.	Kuma kyau yana sa mutane farin ciki.
She could have brought more money with her.	Da ma ta kara kawo kudi da ita.
I don't have much.	Bani da yawa.
They love to travel fast.	Suna matukar son tafiya da sauri.
Of course, that did not happen.	Tabbas hakan bai samu ba.
He’s done this before, of course.	Ya taba yin wannan a baya, ba shakka.
Wait until morning.	Jira har sai da safe.
Therefore, they cannot be found.	Don haka, ba za a iya samun su ba.
We will see.	Za mu gani.
She hit it off.	Ta buga shi.
Maybe I should try that.	Wataƙila zan gwada hakan.
I gave him a hand.	Na ba shi hannu.
It didn't work.	Bai yi aiki ba.
I will be honest with you.	Zan yi gaskiya tare da ku.
You will love them.	Za ku so su.
This will help the problem.	Wannan zai taimaka matsalar.
You missed me.	Ka rasa ni.
Less about amazing things.	Kadan game da abubuwan ban mamaki.
It should not be here.	Bai kamata a nan ba.
I can imagine what they saw.	Ina iya tunanin abin da suka gani.
How close we are not here today.	Yaya kusa da ba mu nan a yau.
I also volunteered.	Na kuma yi aikin sa kai.
I just put them in it.	Ina sa su a ciki kawai.
He was given coffee.	Aka ba shi kofi.
And this happens whether you like it or not.	Kuma wannan yana faruwa ko kuna so ko a'a.
Never found one.	Ba a taɓa samun ɗaya ba.
She was so sick of that.	Ta kasance kamar rashin lafiya akan wannan.
Maybe what he was going to buy just ended.	Watakila abin da zai saya kawai ya kare.
He finished that.	Ya gama da haka.
They can hear it.	Suna iya jin shi.
It's hard to find.	Yana da wuya ya samu.
Be honest and truthful.	Ku kasance da gaskiya da gaskiya.
She wants to be somewhere.	Ta so tana wani waje.
Of course, that is nothing.	Tabbas, wanda ba komai bane.
I'll tell you why.	Zan gaya muku dalilin haka.
It can't be anything.	Ba zai iya zama wani abu ba.
And there should be a place.	Kuma ya kamata a sami wani wuri.
They will worry about them later.	Za su damu da su daga baya.
No problem found.	Ba a sami matsala ba.
That's what happened.	Haka abin ya faru.
And we are not good at it.	Kuma ba mu da kyau a ciki.
So he stood close.	Don haka ya tsaya kusa.
Probably nothing.	Wataƙila ba komai ba ne.
Things are starting to get hot, though.	Abubuwa sun fara yin zafi, duk da haka.
She cries a lot.	Kuka take sosai.
You are very sad.	Kuna da bakin ciki sosai.
They have no children, except for one another.	Ba su da 'ya'ya, sai juna.
He was needed.	Ya aka bukata.
We have to keep it going.	Dole ne mu ci gaba da shi.
They desperately need help.	Suna buƙatar taimako sosai.
Can you give me some money?	Za a iya ba ni wasu kuɗi?
From	Daga
Sitting is hard.	Zama yayi da wuya.
I kept going beyond what was in my head.	Na ci gaba da wuce abin da ke cikin kaina.
So let me get to that.	Don haka bari in kai ga haka.
You are not everyone.	Kai ba kowa ba ne.
He would be a good man.	Zai yi kyakkyawan mutum.
I did well.	Na yi kyau.
She had heard this saying before.	Ta taba jin wannan magana a baya.
You heard me talk.	Kun ji na yi magana.
Who started?	Wanene ya fara?
As we do not really know.	Kamar yadda ba mu da gaske sani.
He knows it too.	Ya san shi ma.
I want to know where she is.	Ina so in san inda take.
She was always serious.	Koyaushe sai ta kasance da gaske.
Take care of her carefully, if you talk to her.	Ka kula da ita a hankali, idan ka yi mata magana.
This room is completely empty.	Wannan dakin gaba daya babu kowa.
Every day of this celebration is a day of life.	Kowace rana na wannan bikin rana ce ta rayuwa.
Sometimes it just doesn't seem right.	Wani lokacin ma kamar bai dace da shi ba.
I played with them.	Na yi wasa da su.
I want to cry	Ina so in yi kuka
But at this point we can not accept it.	Amma a wannan lokacin ba za mu iya yarda da shi ba.
Girls should be seen and not heard.	Ya kamata a ga 'yan mata kada a ji su.
I had to bring her home several times.	Sai da na kawo mata gida sau da yawa.
My favorite movie.	Fim ɗin da na fi so.
I am not well.	Ba ni da lafiya.
He was home alone, so no problem.	Yana gida shi kaɗai, don haka ba matsala.
It's really nice.	Yana da kyau gaske.
The house is full of people.	Gidan ya cika da mutane.
To start everything again, he thought.	Don fara komai a sake, ya yi tunani.
Someone must buy it for him.	Dole ne wani ya saya masa.
Even if you are.	Ko da kun kasance.
No, of course not.	A'a, tabbas ba yau ba.
We are back from work.	Mun dawo daga aiki.
In fact, we can move on.	A gaskiya ma, za mu iya ci gaba.
Your problem will be.	Matsalar ku za ta kasance.
The story is playing with them.	Labarin yana wasa da su.
He has been here for almost a year.	Ya yi kusan shekara guda a nan.
Two months later they returned home.	Bayan wata biyu suka dawo gida.
She is passionate.	Ita sha'awa ce.
Sometimes, mistakes can be the best thing that ever happened.	Wani lokaci, kuskure na iya zama mafi kyawun abin da ya faru.
This surprised me at first, but it worked really well.	Wannan ya ba ni mamaki da farko, amma yana aiki da kyau da kyau.
You too.	Za ku kuma.
I did not want to continue.	Ban so in ci gaba ba.
It will help you get a job.	Zai taimaka muku samun aiki.
He always does what he thinks is best for me.	Koyaushe yana yin abin da yake tunanin shine mafi kyau a gare ni.
Do not leave it unattended!	Kada ku bar shi ba tare da kula ba!
It certainly is nothing.	Lallai ba komai ba ne.
But she prefers.	Amma ta fi so.
You can take what comes to you on your own.	Kuna iya ɗaukar abin da ke zuwa muku da kanku.
It was difficult at first.	Yana da wuya a farko.
I can not say.	Ba zan iya fada ba.
It will never catch one.	Ba zai taba kama daya ba.
This is scary.	Wannan da tsoro.
And well it can.	Kuma da kyau yana iya.
It can be done, but it is not easy.	Ana iya yi, amma ba shi da sauƙi.
Make the women sit down.	Ka sa mata su zauna.
Nothing.	Babu wani abu.
Maybe that sounds good, but it doesn't feel right.	Wataƙila hakan yayi kyau, amma bai ji daɗi ba.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
I didn’t think of anything at the time.	Ban yi tunanin komai ba a lokacin.
And that's an interesting thing.	Kuma abin da ke da ban sha'awa ke nan.
I called immediately.	Na kira nan take.
Or just tell us how you feel.	Ko kuma kawai gaya mana yadda kuke ji.
Everyone stopped talking.	Kowa ya bar magana.
I hated it at home.	Na ƙi shi a gida.
I was there when it opened.	Ina can lokacin da aka bude.
To get here even though we need to do a little work.	Don isa nan ko da yake muna buƙatar yin ɗan aiki kaɗan.
I don’t care about the rest at all.	Ban damu da sauran ba gaba ɗaya.
Just take it up to others.	Kawai kai har zuwa wasu.
Hands close to each other.	Hannu a kusa da juna.
This is where the real work begins.	A nan ne ainihin aikin ya fara.
He has nothing.	Ba shi da komai.
I was worried about myself.	Na damu da kaina.
Further why you will tell me what is being said.	Ƙarin dalilin da ya sa za ku gaya mani abin da ake faɗa.
This calls for an end.	Wannan yana kira ga ƙarshe.
Someone will come.	Wani zai zo.
And another.	Kuma da wani.
Since then no one has heard from him.	Tun daga lokacin babu wanda ya ji daga gare shi.
This is also a mental error.	Wannan kuma kuskure ne na hankali.
Not the way she used to do to me.	Ba yadda ta saba yi min ba.
we will do the same.	haka za mu yi.
You, you know, be with them.	Kai, ka sani, zama tare da su.
Keep up the great work !.	Ci gaba da babban aikin!.
As it were.	Kamar yadda ya kasance.
Someone like him.	Wani mai kama da shi.
You too.	Kai kuma.
Is there any way to fix this?	Ko akwai wata hanyar gyara wannan?.
The irrigation program was a success.	Shirin ban ruwa ya yi nasara.
It was a hot day.	Rana mai zafi ta buga masa.
It is time to think about you.	Lokaci ya yi da za mu yi tunani game da ku.
I can't help myself.	Ba zan iya taimakon kaina ba.
That would be a lie.	Hakan kuma zai zama karya.
And it still works.	Kuma har yanzu yana aiki.
He loves to travel.	Yana da sha'awar tafiya.
It looks so good.	Ya yi kyau sosai.
This may not be correct.	Wannan ba zai iya zama daidai ba.
However, it does not work.	Duk da haka, ba ya aiki.
Hope you enjoyed it very much.	Da fatan kun ji daɗi sosai.
If I am right, and please correct me if I am wrong.	Idan na yi daidai, kuma don Allah a yi min gyara idan na yi kuskure.
No one agreed.	Ba wanda ya yarda da shi.
The game is just around the corner.	Wasan kusa ne kawai.
I don't remember that.	Ban tuna da hakan ba.
We think two things should be done.	Muna ganin ya kamata a yi abubuwa biyu.
I hope you agree.	Ina fatan kun yarda da hakan.
Everything so far.	Komai ya zuwa yanzu.
I ran with my passion.	Na gudu da aikin sha'awa na.
This has been difficult.	Wannan ya kasance mai wahala.
I do it to really enjoy.	Ina yin shi don jin daɗi sosai.
Some are more difficult to obtain.	Wasu sun fi wasu wuya a samu.
There is so much to do!	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a yi!
I want to hear the story.	Ina son jin labarin.
It may still be the first.	Har yanzu yana iya zama na farko.
But she is tired of continuing.	Amma ta gaji ta ci gaba.
Before she was.	Kafin ta kasance .
It's so amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki sosai.
The one here is the one who lives now.	Wanda yake nan shi ne wanda yake zaune a yanzu.
Something went wrong with it.	Wani abu bai yi daidai ba game da shi.
This is nothing new, however.	Wannan ba sabon abu ba ne, duk da haka.
Therefore, it is highly recommended to use it.	Saboda haka, an ba da shawarar sosai don amfani da shi.
This cannot continue.	Wannan ba zai iya ci gaba ba.
The truth is a big deal.	Gaskiya babban abu ne.
You know this.	Kun san wannan.
Maybe it's a good thing.	Wataƙila abu ne mai kyau.
And well he could.	Kuma da kyau ya iya.
Everyone has this.	Kowa yana da wannan.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba haka bane.
This is not the same.	Wannan ba daya ba ne.
Somehow she lost.	Ko yaya ta rasa.
The water grows in summer.	Ruwan yana girma a lokacin zafi.
They walked on the road.	Sun yi tafiya a kan hanya.
He is dead.	Ya mutu.
They are just smart.	Suna da hankali kawai.
And now on earth.	Kuma yanzu a duniya.
Let him be with me as you say.	Bari ya kasance tare da ni kamar yadda kuka ce.
I don't think they should all get involved.	Ina ganin bai kamata su duka su shiga ba.
It must be published.	Dole ne a buga shi.
Of course I do, it's nice to see.	Tabbas na yi, yana da kyau in gani.
Every day she finished her homework.	Kullum sai ta gama aikin gida.
They would have been amazing.	Da sun kasance masu ban mamaki.
It has to be you.	Dole ne ya zama ku.
I do not see how you can lose it.	Ban ga yadda za ku iya rasa shi ba.
This was put very close to her.	An sanya wannan kusa da ita sosai.
Not just married with children, but happy.	Ba kawai aure da yara, amma farin ciki.
You are right.	Kun yi daidai.
He was afraid to touch her.	Ya ji tsoron taba ta.
He has to prove it.	Dole ne ya tabbatar.
That does not happen.	Hakan baya faruwa.
It just doesn't work.	Kawai baya aiki.
It can be very difficult.	Yana iya zama da wahala sosai.
They feel so good.	Suna jin dadi sosai.
They have done many good things for me.	Sun yi mini abubuwa masu kyau da yawa.
The furniture is very nice.	Dakin kayan yayi sosai.
One or two.	Daya ko biyu.
It grew rapidly and made great strides.	Ya girma cikin sauri kuma ya sami ci gaba sosai.
I happened to agree it would not work.	Na faru na yarda ba zai yi aiki ba.
Nothing to worry about.	Babu wani abu da zai damu.
That worked out well for him.	Hakan yayi masa kyau.
What should you not do?	Me bai kamata ku yi ba?
It's interesting	Yana da ban sha'awa
It is still cold.	Har yanzu yana da sanyi.
Everyone is outside and near.	Kowa yana waje da kusa.
Fear has returned to him now.	Tsoro ya sake zuwa gare shi yanzu.
How often this happens is unknown.	Sau nawa hakan ke faruwa ba a sani ba.
You have your place.	Kuna da wurin ku.
That's one thing.	Abu daya kenan.
There is nothing he can do here.	Babu wani abu da zai iya yi a nan.
Like, really.	Kamar, na gaske.
I think it went well.	Ina ganin ya tafi da kyau.
They will return.	Za su dawo.
Honestly I did not see that.	Gaskiya ban ga haka ba.
I can't give as much as she does.	Ba zan iya ba kamar yadda ta yi.
That did not surprise me.	Hakan bai bani mamaki ba.
She can't put an end to things now.	Ta kasa kawo karshen abubuwa yanzu.
He thinks they are patient.	Yana ganin suna da hakuri.
I really enjoyed the hot coffee.	Na ji daɗin kyakkyawan kofi mai zafi.
She hopes he will be careful.	Ta yi fatan zai yi hankali.
The ship is well maintained.	An kula da jirgin sosai.
You do not have to think.	Ba sai ka yi tunanin ba.
Maybe it can work.	Wataƙila yana iya aiki.
By no means is it a big house.	Ba ta kowace hanya ba wani babban gida ne.
A lot of attention.	Hankali mai yawa.
How quickly it changed.	Yaya da sauri ya canza.
Release.	Saka.
There are many more home runs.	Akwai ƙarin gudu na gida da yawa.
But now nothing.	Amma yanzu ba komai.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
There is so much to do nearby.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a yi a kusa da nan.
I hear them talking, but not really what they are saying.	Ina jin suna magana, amma ba ainihin abin da ake faɗa ba.
You have a new opportunity here.	Kuna da sabon dama a nan.
Mind you, we can’t do that.	A tunani, ba za mu iya yin haka ba.
But somehow he could catch the game.	Amma ko ta yaya zai iya kama wasan.
Talk to them through it.	Yi magana da su ta hanyar shi.
She's lying, you know.	Karya take yi, ka sani.
That's what he said.	A haka ya ce.
If he kills you, he kills you.	Idan ya kashe ka, ya kashe ka.
Looks like he's lost or missing.	Kamar ya bata ko ba ya nan.
She is in the ark.	Tana cikin jirgin.
And they agreed.	Kuma sun yarda da shi.
It was the night of the incident.	Ya kasance a daren da abin ya faru.
Good night.	Sai dare.
They do not know each other's names.	Ba su san sunan juna ba.
Honestly I don't know what to say.	Gaskiya ban san me zan ce ba.
I walked out of the restaurant.	Na fita daga gidan abincin.
It worked really well.	Ya yi aiki sosai da kyau.
You do not need to trust me.	Ba ka bukatar ka yarda da ni.
But we will lose our identity.	Amma za mu rasa ainihin mu.
Although it is difficult.	Ko da yake yana da wuya.
Nothing, absolutely nothing.	Babu komai, gaba daya babu komai.
They are, of course, so.	Su ne, ba shakka, haka.
However, they too will not help him.	Duk da haka, su ma ba za su taimake shi ba.
This is not true!	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne!
It should be.	Ya kamata ya kasance.
But so what.	Amma haka me.
It has been two years since that night.	Shekara biyu kenan da wannan daren.
It seems there.	Da alama akwai.
It happens without any real effort.	Yana faruwa ba tare da wani ƙoƙari na gaske ba.
They can only use this opportunity twice.	Za su iya amfani da wannan dama sau biyu kawai.
I don't care what they are.	Ban damu da menene su ba.
Something killed here.	Wani abu ya kashe a nan.
Do you have.	Kuna da.
We did not succeed.	Ba mu yi nasara ba.
He wanted her to go.	Ya so ta tafi.
You feel it all.	Kuna jin shi duka.
He must have been hurt.	Dole ne ya ji rauni.
So this will be paid for.	Don haka za a biya wannan.
They just play.	Wasa kawai suke yi.
Don't ask me what he thinks.	Kar ka tambaye ni me yake tunani.
I learned it, of course.	Na koyi shi, babu shakka.
No tomorrow here.	Babu gobe a nan.
That is not fair.	Hakan bai dace ba.
I want to come back.	Ina so in dawo.
There was only one person in the room.	Akwai wani mutum daya a dakin.
So you can't.	Don haka ba za ku yi ba.
It was a great time.	Ya kasance babban lokaci.
I told you so.	Na gaya muku haka.
Like the best thing ever.	Kamar mafi kyawun abu koyaushe.
It is not helpful.	Ba shi da taimako.
I can make these decisions myself.	Zan iya yanke waɗannan shawarar da kaina.
Still they keep going.	Duk da haka suna ci gaba.
It works on it.	Yana aiki a kai.
You should not run like that.	Bai kamata ka gudu haka ba.
And he is the one who suffers.	Kuma shi ne yake shan wahala.
I know she is.	Na san ita ce.
Not very good.	Ba kyau sosai.
It's all over the world.	Duk duniya ce.
Maybe you were in the past.	Wataƙila kun kasance a baya.
Something is happening.	Wani abu yana faruwa.
How did you learn so much?	Ta yaya kuka koyi da yawa haka?
I never did.	Ban taba ta ba.
No one else here.	Babu wani kuma a nan.
This is not always the case.	Ba koyaushe haka yake ba.
He was completely honest.	Ya kasance mai gaskiya ne gaba ɗaya.
Man finished.	Mutum ya gama.
He may even succeed.	Yana iya ma yayi nasara.
And you have been making mistakes for a while.	Kuma kun kasance kuna yin kuskure na ɗan lokaci.
However, a dog is not a dog.	Duk da haka, kare ba kare ba ne.
He will go.	Zai tafi.
Nothing more.	Babu komai kuma.
Do a good job.	Yi aiki mai kyau.
They begin to laugh.	Suka fara dariya.
He did not know where.	Bai san ina ba.
Until we know whether it is true or not.	Har sai mun san ko gaskiya ne ko a'a.
Lots here.	Da yawa a nan.
About me.	A kai na.
And what you want too.	Kuma abin da kuke so ma.
She likes to talk a lot.	Ta fi son magana sosai.
It should not be taken early.	Bai kamata a fara sha da wuri ba.
Many people drink too much.	Mutane da yawa suna sha da yawa.
Keep up the good work, for now.	Ci gaba da hakan, a yanzu.
Come on in, take a look.	Shiga, ku fita.
I would never tell anyone.	Ba zan taba gaya wa kowa ba.
And they did.	Kuma suka yi.
I hope he does it though.	Ina fatan ya yi shi ko.
You are with her.	Kuna tare da ita.
He did not speak further.	Bata kara magana ba.
Let's try this again.	Bari mu sake gwada wannan.
We were in the same boat as you.	Mun kasance a cikin jirgin ruwa daya da ku.
Who just asked me.	Wanda kawai ka tambaye ni.
Maybe they were comfortable.	Watakila sun kasance masu jin dadi.
They all know him.	Duk sun san shi.
I can say she didn’t.	Zan iya cewa ba ta yi ba.
Things you will not understand.	Abubuwan da ba za ku gane ba.
Maybe he will.	Wataƙila zai yi.
Yet in the end he gives him what he needs.	Amma duk da haka a karshen yana ba shi abin da yake bukata.
I want to enjoy it.	Ina so in ji daɗi da shi.
In the end, you have to be with that person.	A ƙarshe, dole ne ku kasance tare da wannan mutumin.
Store very cold.	Ajiye yayi sanyi sosai.
The flight is on time.	Jirgin yana kan lokaci.
That's what he said.	Abin da ya ce kenan.
Just to touch her.	Kawai don taba ta.
Did something happen?	Shin wani abu ya faru?
I'm not sure about that anymore.	Ban tabbata ba game da hakan kuma.
You need someone.	Kuna buƙatar wani .
No, wait, it's there.	A'a, jira, yana can.
After a while they reached a good land.	Bayan wani lokaci sai suka isa kasa mai kyau.
I am fine.	Ina lafiya.
Do your best.	Yi abin da kuka fi kyau.
You are beautiful too.	Kuna da kyau kuma.
But simple is not so.	Amma mai sauƙi ba haka ba ne.
As long as they run fast, they are safe.	Matukar sun gudu da sauri, suna lafiya.
We had lunch at two.	Mun yi abincin rana a biyu.
It does not exist.	Babu shi.
You too.	Kai kuma ma.
But he did not care.	Amma bai damu da hakan ba.
I say it.	Ina fada da shi.
The strange man passed by the house.	Mutumin mai ban mamaki ya wuce gida.
Maybe they will get hurt.	Wataƙila za su ji rauni.
He is indeed studying now.	Lallai yana karatu yanzu.
So very cold.	Don haka sanyi sosai.
I do not feel that way.	Ba na jin haka.
I need to fix myself.	Ya kamata in gyara kaina.
It is hard work and difficult.	Yana da aiki da wahala.
You know you have.	Ka san kana da.
So no, you can't just remove it.	Don haka a'a, ba za ku iya cire shi kawai ba.
This is not about that.	Wannan ba game da wannan ba ne.
I can't fly with you guys.	Ba zan iya tashi tare da ku mutane ba.
They will be filled early and the rest.	Za a cika su da wuri da sauran.
Let’s take one approach at a time.	Mu dauki hanya daya a lokaci guda.
Maybe he wouldn't like it.	Wataƙila ba zai so shi ba.
It always makes you feel good.	Koyaushe ya sa ku ji daɗi.
You have never seen that in a movie.	Ba ka taba ganin haka a fim ba.
Read on.	Karanta a kai.
There must be something he can do.	Dole ne a sami abin da zai iya yi.
He did not care for her.	Bai kula ta ba.
Everyone does.	Kowa yayi.
I stayed there for a while.	Na zauna a can na ɗan lokaci.
I should have had more time.	Ya kamata in sami lokaci mai yawa.
He does not like money.	Ba ya son kudi.
I decided to try it for myself.	Na yanke shawarar gwada shi da kaina.
Some went out and some stayed.	Wasu sun fita wasu kuma suka zauna.
I found nothing scary in this.	Ban sami abin tsoro a cikin wannan ba.
But we are still close.	Amma har yanzu muna kusa.
It wasn’t so hot just in the past.	Bai kasance mai zafi haka kawai a baya ba.
You do it.	Kuna yi shi.
You see an act of acceptance.	Kun ga wani aiki na yarda.
I learned a lot from him.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa daga gare shi.
Anyone who wants to can check them out.	Duk wanda yake so zai iya duba su.
I will have time to disown myself later.	Zan sami lokacin da zan ƙi kaina daga baya.
Throughout the story, no one should pay anyone.	A cikin duka labarin, babu wanda ya isa ya biya kowa.
Someone started working.	Wani ya fara aiki.
The rest I catch quickly.	Sauran na kama da sauri.
It has to be an opportunity to make money.	Dole ne ya zama damar samun kuɗi.
You are dead now.	Kun mutu yanzu.
Do all this without carrying equipment.	Yi duk wannan ba tare da ɗaukar kayan aiki ba.
The water was delicious!	Ruwan ya yi dadi!
This dog is sleeping.	Wannan kare yana barci.
You did not.	Ba ka yi ba.
It didn't have to happen, but they still left it at that.	Ba lallai ne hakan ya faru ba, amma duk da haka sun bar shi a ciki.
I'm talking about it here.	Ina magana game da shi a nan.
She left us for a while.	Ta bar mu na ɗan lokaci.
They are still all scared.	Har yanzu duk suna tsoro.
There is still no answer.	Har yanzu babu amsa.
It will not get easy.	Ba zai samu sauƙi ba.
He wanted her to get it all.	Ya so ta samu duka.
Of course I would not tell him how to play.	Tabbas ba zan gaya masa yadda ake wasa ba.
He knows.	Ya san.
It’s my experiences.	Abubuwan da na samu ne.
It looks like it's done well.	Ga alama an yi shi da kyau.
Sometimes it feels like pain.	Wani lokaci yana jin kamar zafi.
I like this game.	Ina son wannan wasan.
That was the right time.	Hakan ya kasance daidai lokacin.
However, they do not seem to be married yet.	Duk da haka, da alama ba su yi aure ba tukuna.
I'm sure you will like this.	Na tabbata za ku so wannan.
I like this one to go.	Ina kamar wannan ya tafi.
Here they give him a job.	Nan suka ba shi aiki.
You are walking on water.	Kuna tafiya akan ruwa.
And he came out two days later.	Kuma ya fito bayan kwana biyu.
She was right.	Ta yi daidai.
The same is true for me.	Haka abin yake min.
The same is true for you.	Haka ke gare ku.
It is your decision.	Shi ne shawarar ku.
We did that.	Mun yi haka.
They want her back.	Sun so ta dawo.
This will get you there.	Wannan zai kai ku can.
Which as you know very well.	Wanda kamar yadda kuka sani sosai.
I need to show someone.	Ina bukata in nuna wani.
I will kill her.	Zan kashe ta.
You don’t want to tell me, you don’t have to.	Ba ku so ku gaya mani, ba dole ba ne.
He walked again.	Yayi tafiya kuma.
We work together from time to time.	Muna aiki tare lokaci zuwa lokaci.
I want to go	Ina son tafiya
Really, really big.	Gaskiya, babban gaske.
I do not know what he is doing.	Ban san me yake yi ba.
You are beautiful.	Kuna da kyau.
We do a lot of other things too.	Mu ma muna yin wasu abubuwa da yawa.
I was afraid to think about what might happen to us.	Ina jin tsoron tunanin abin da zai iya faruwa da mu.
Someone had to help her.	Dole ne wani ya taimaka mata.
I watch them and I really like what they have.	Ina kallon su kuma ina matukar son abin da suke da shi.
He enjoys life.	Yana jin daɗin rayuwa.
Try to work together, they say.	Yi ƙoƙarin yin tare, in ji su.
It was easy to find.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi samu.
I did not play with them.	Ban yi wasa da su ba.
For a while nothing happened.	Na dan lokaci babu abin da ya faru.
He has some money.	Ya na da dan kudi.
He certainly did not know it.	Shakka bai san shi ba.
He did it well once.	Ya sanya shi da kyau sau ɗaya.
They want to see that they do well.	Suna son ganin sun yi kyau.
He stopped walking.	Ya daina tafiya.
I learned how to do it.	Na koyi yadda zan yi.
But without it.	Amma ba tare da shi ba .
Now you see it is over.	Yanzu ka ga an gama.
We need to get involved.	Muna bukatar mu kai hannu.
You can go fast.	Kuna iya tafiya da sauri.
She was alone.	Ta kasance ita kadai.
I was very happy.	Na yi matukar farin ciki sosai.
We have to keep them.	Dole ne mu ci gaba da su.
What you are doing is amazing.	Abin da kuke yi yana da ban mamaki.
Not yet, though.	Ba tukuna, ko da yake.
There is no time to lose.	Babu lokacin da za a rasa.
You can see by looking that no one is happy here.	Kuna iya gane ta hanyar kallon cewa babu wanda ke farin ciki a nan.
Some are more advanced than others.	Wasu sun fi wasu ci gaba.
Let's stay inside.	Mu zauna a ciki.
But we need to keep going.	Amma muna bukatar mu ci gaba.
I didn't plan it.	Ban shirya shi ba.
Even one life is too much.	Ko da rayuwa daya ta yi yawa.
It is easy to imagine these thoughts.	Yana da sauƙi a yi tunanin waɗannan tunani.
This, too, will pass.	Wannan kuma, zai wuce.
Bring me one.	Kawo min daya.
And, you know, go check them out.	Kuma, ka sani, ka je ka duba su.
She could not see or hear anything.	Ba ta iya gani ko jin komai.
I do not run here and there.	Ba na gudu nan da can.
Do it for us, you know.	Yi mana, ka sani.
They stood there thinking the man was hurt.	Sun tsaya suna tunanin mutumin ya ji rauni.
You have been there for a while.	Kun kasance a can na ɗan lokaci.
I feel so good.	Na ji dadi sosai.
It's nothing.	Ba wani abu ba ne.
She is awesome!	Tana da ban tsoro!
I will do anything for you.	Zan yi maka komai.
Don't worry.	Kar ka damu.
Only one world.	Duniya guda ɗaya kawai.
When you are sitting waiting for a place.	Lokacin da kuke zaune kuna jira wani wuri.
I don’t give a damn what happened with the money.	Ban ba da komai ba abin da ya faru da kuɗin.
He was the first.	Shine na farko.
You are right.	Kun kasance daidai.
She failed though.	Ta kasa ko.
Take care of each other.	Kula da juna.
It's more than that.	Ya fi haka yawa.
But there is one thing that everyone should know.	Amma akwai abu daya da kowa ya kamata ya sani.
Eventually, it will be difficult.	Daga baya, zai zama da wahala.
I'll do the rest.	Zan yi sauran.
I really want him dead.	Lallai ina son ya mutu.
I have thought about it many times.	Na yi tunani game da ita sau da yawa.
She is beautiful.	Tana da kyau.
I can't leave, not now.	Ba zan iya barin ba, ba yanzu ba.
Time to go to lunch.	Lokaci don zuwa abincin rana.
Inside.	A ciki.
We learn from each other.	Muna koyi da juna.
Answer me that.	Amsa min wannan.
This school is scary.	Wannan makaranta abin tsoro ne.
So she did not tell anyone at first.	Don haka ba ta gaya wa kowa ba da farko.
And they didn't.	Kuma ba su yi ba.
However, things did not go well.	Duk da haka, abubuwa ba su da kyau.
She is back.	Ta dawo.
But it is difficult for him.	Amma yana da wuya a gare shi.
He has not yet joined.	Har yanzu bai shiga ba.
The man continued to walk about how healthy he was.	Mutumin ya ci gaba da tafiya game da yadda lafiya take.
They need a place to live.	Suna buƙatar wani wuri da za su ji daɗi.
He knew he would be safe.	Ya san zai zauna lafiya.
Let's go.	Mu tafi.
She is.	Ita ce.
He definitely wanted to find out.	Tabbas ya so ka gano.
I let him touch me.	Na bar shi ya taba ni.
The right thing was done.	An yi aikin da ya dace.
I'm surprised you don't know this.	Na yi mamaki da ba ku san wannan ba.
We were very close.	Mun kasance kusa sosai.
So they were killed.	Don haka aka kashe su.
He is alive now.	Yana rayuwa a yanzu.
He wanted to catch up.	Ya so ya kama.
Start where one is.	Fara inda daya yake.
That did not happen either.	Hakan ma bai faru ba.
It was an amazing time for me.	Lokaci ne mai ban mamaki a gare ni.
But no.	Amma a'a.
Off they went.	A kashe suka tafi.
How can you make sure that it does not happen?	Ta yaya za ku tabbatar da hakan bai faru ba?
For me the truth is enough.	A gare ni gaskiya ta isa.
We will win this game.	Za mu yi nasara a wannan wasan.
Many children die today.	Yara da yawa sun mutu a yau.
I am nobody else.	Ni kuma ba wani.
But this is not true.	Amma wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
He knew it was easy.	Ya san ya kasance mai sauƙi.
Actually, review this.	A gaskiya, sake duba wannan.
An easy way to travel.	Hanya mai sauƙi don tafiya.
He looked into the water.	Ya kalli cikin ruwan.
They will never remove them.	Ba za su taba cire su ba.
They are as follows.	Suna kamar haka.
I will go	Zan tafi
I love the person so much.	Ina son mutumin sosai.
It was cold.	Sanyi ya kasance.
I will leave early.	Zan fita da wuri.
I was not sick and I heard them all.	Ba ni da lafiya da na ji su duka.
It's about feeling happy.	Yana da game da jin farin ciki.
Near home.	Kusa da gida.
It looks good on her.	Yayi mata kyau.
I have to go back.	Dole ne in koma.
He never skinned.	Ya taba fata.
It is finally time for you to find a place to stay.	Lokaci ya yi a ƙarshe don ku sami wurin zama.
That we can see.	Da za mu iya gani.
He was one and everything, completely.	Ya kasance daya da komai, gaba daya.
First of all, long.	Da farko, tsawon lokaci.
It's necessary.	Ya zama dole.
But he also commits suicide.	Amma kuma yana kashe kansa.
I am not afraid of what people say about me.	Ba na jin tsoron abin da mutane ke cewa game da ni.
It can be done.	Ana iya yin hakan.
They took us, they gave us a home.	Sun kai mu, sun ba mu gida.
There is something wrong with it.	Akwai wani abu na karya game da shi.
Nothing makes sense.	Babu wani abu da ya sa hankali.
It seems that nothing works.	Da alama babu abin da ke aiki.
Open to him.	Ku bude masa.
I would highly recommend it.	Zan ba shi shawarar sosai.
He did not reach her.	Bai kai ta ba.
You hope so.	Kuna fatan haka ne.
So the book is still on sale here.	Don haka har yanzu ana sayar da littafin a nan.
It's funny.	Abin dariya ne.
It's not funny.	Ba abin dariya ba ne.
Even if someone is sick.	Ko da wani ba shi da lafiya.
Check out this book.	Duba wannan littafin.
Two at the same time.	Biyu a lokaci guda.
You tell us whether you took these or not.	Kuna gaya mana ko kun ɗauki waɗannan ko a'a.
But it can not be.	Amma ba zai iya zama ba.
I do not want to.	Ban so ba.
All lies, lies, lies.	Duk karya, karya, karya.
That's all.	Wannan duka.
So add one, one, one.	Don haka a ƙara ɗaya, ɗaya, ɗaya.
He can get what he wants to eat.	Zai iya samun abin da yake so ya ci.
We are changing lives.	Muna canza rayuwa.
It's late.	Lokaci ya wuce.
However they were difficult.	Duk da haka sun kasance da wuya.
He could not think of anything.	Bai iya tunanin komai ba.
I don't even know if it's a game anymore.	Ban ma sani ba ko wasa ne kuma.
I'll call about it.	Zan kira game da ita.
It's not easy.	Ba shi da sauƙi.
Maybe he doesn't know what it is.	Wataƙila bai san menene ba.
Only they know what is best.	Su ne kawai suka san abin da ya fi kyau.
He should not stay.	Kada ya zauna.
You look good, like you slept once.	Ka yi kyau, kamar ka yi barci sau ɗaya.
Slowly now.	A hankali yanzu.
There and not there.	A can kuma ba a can ba.
Of course I was not one of those cool kids.	Tabbas ban kasance daya daga cikin yara masu sanyi ba.
This last one is not so.	Wannan na ƙarshe ba haka ba ne.
It's almost the same time.	Kusan lokaci guda ne.
But it should be checked.	Amma yakamata a duba.
Maybe that's not true.	Wataƙila hakan ba gaskiya ba ne.
I think she is with me.	Ina tsammanin tana tare da ni.
No one bothered to look.	Babu wanda ya damu ya duba.
If someone comes home he will give it time.	Idan wani ya zo gida zai ba shi lokaci.
I hated it in the right way.	Na ƙi shi ta hanyar da ta dace.
This is a funny thing to look for.	Wannan abu ne mai ban dariya neman.
Your time has come.	Lokacin ku ya zo.
You will spend the night at home.	Za ku kwana a gidan yau da dare.
Hurry he said.	Yi sauri yace.
So you try to get there and it is very difficult.	Don haka kuna ƙoƙarin isa wurin kuma yana da wahala sosai.
Maybe it should be.	Wataƙila yadda ya kamata ya kasance.
So it is not easy to find them.	Don haka ba shi da sauƙi samun su.
You keep doing it.	Kuna ci gaba da yin hakan.
But a lot is not good.	Amma da yawa ba shi da kyau.
I don't know why he went like that.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa ya tafi haka ba.
The following explains why.	Abubuwan da ke gaba sun bayyana dalilin.
Try to cover it.	Yi ƙoƙarin rufe shi.
Happily, it is unknown.	Farin ciki, ba a san shi ba.
We will cut there too.	Za mu yanke a can ma.
It's not from the player.	Ba daga dan wasa ba ne.
It works in an amazing way.	Yana aiki a hanya mai ban mamaki.
Start your day.	Fara ranar ku.
Where?' 	Ina?'
It can be found, 'she replied.	Za a iya samu,' ta amsa.
But again, we didn’t get it.	Amma kuma, ba mu samu ba.
Do this in everyone's name.	Yi haka da sunan kowa.
At once they stopped.	Nan take suka tsaya.
I only take it at night.	Dare kawai nake dauka.
And the need for something to do.	Kuma da bukatar wani abu yi.
Maybe we should not be surprised.	Wataƙila bai kamata mu yi mamaki ba.
We saw each other a little bit.	Mun ga juna kadan kadan.
Which seems to put it further.	Wanda da alama ya kara sanya shi a gaba.
But no one did.	Amma babu wanda ya yi.
They have.	Suna da.
That is why we are here.	Shi ya sa muke nan.
It could be better.	Zai iya zama mafi kyau.
That would have been amazing.	Da hakan ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
Or even do it.	Ko ma yin shi.
Correct me.	Ka gyara min.
There are so many.	Akwai da yawa.
I agree with the first, but not the last.	Na yarda da na farko, amma ba na ƙarshe ba.
Girls, you know.	'Yan mata, kun sani.
It is very nice to see you all.	Yana da matukar kyau ganin ku duka.
Or not you now.	Ko ba kai yanzu ba.
It puts yourself out there.	Yana sa kanku waje.
I know better.	Na fi sani.
Would you please tell me the time, please?	Za a iya gaya mani lokaci, don Allah?
But several things went wrong.	Amma wasu abubuwa da yawa sun yi kuskure.
We are safe.	Muna nan lafiya.
I try to eat healthy.	Ina ƙoƙarin cin abinci lafiya.
She wants to go home crying.	Ta so ta koma gida tana kuka.
Now he does not want at all.	Yanzu baya so ko kadan.
I have already tried.	Na riga na gwada.
She said no one asked her if she needed help.	Ta ce babu wanda ya tambaye ta ko tana bukatar taimako.
Everything is fine.	Komai yayi kyau.
No one can know your work.	Babu wanda zai iya sanin aikin ku.
We cannot do without them.	Ba za mu iya yi ba tare da su ba.
He opened the car door, and they came out.	Ya bude kofar motar, suka fito.
But you have more money which is good.	Amma kuna da ƙarin kuɗi wanda yake da kyau.
I think that should be done.	Ina ganin hakan ya dace a yi.
This is just what they need.	Wannan shi ne kawai abin da suke bukata.
You can't do anything like that.	Ba za ku yi komai irin wannan ba.
I'll tell you about it.	Zan gaya muku game da shi.
You know where you want to go.	Kun san inda kuke son zuwa.
This is all very interesting.	Wannan duk yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
He seems to be waiting for someone else.	Da alama yana jiran wani.
She slowly closed the door.	Ta shiga a hankali ta rufe kofar.
You know you like it !.	Kun san kuna so!.
What we have to do is work together well.	Abin da za mu yi shi ne yin aiki tare da kyau.
I am not interested in any sport.	Ba ni da sha'awar kowane wasa.
I read the article.	Na karanta labarin.
How much does it cost?	Nawa yake yi.
The rest of the flight will not give you a second chance.	Sauran jirgin ba zai ba ku dama ta biyu ba.
No one knows what will happen.	Babu wanda ya san abin da zai faru.
We must prepare for it.	Dole ne mu shirya masa.
He knows how to change who you are.	Ya san yadda zai iya canza ko wanene ku.
We did not meet through each other.	Ba mu hadu ta hanyar juna ba.
It wouldn’t surprise me if he still hasn’t run.	Ba zai ba ni mamaki ba idan har yanzu bai gudu ba.
He said we would not do that.	Ya ce ba za mu yi haka ba.
I have done it for many people.	Na yi wa mutane da yawa.
Then fall asleep.	Sai barci.
This method is the only way we can know.	Wannan hanyar ita ce kawai hanyar da za mu iya sani.
And there is no need.	Kuma babu bukata.
Make sure you do this safely.	Ya tabbata yin haka lafiya.
The food is delicious.	Abincin nan yana da daɗi.
Then we will start work tomorrow.	Daga nan za mu fara aiki gobe.
Or when you doubt a lot.	Ko kuma lokacin da kuke shakka da yawa.
I asked him what was going on?	Na tambaye shi me ke faruwa?
In fact, I stopped working for a while.	A gaskiya na daina aiki na ɗan lokaci.
He drank a drink.	Ya sha abin sha.
It is her life.	Ita ce ta rayuwa.
One car did not pass.	Mota daya bata wuce ba.
He did not know how he knew.	Bai san yadda ya sani ba.
The error cannot be corrected.	Ba za a iya gyara ɗan kuskure ba.
Nothing impressed her.	Babu abin da ya sha'awar ta.
But you run all the time.	Amma kuna gudu kowane lokaci.
They will not leave the house.	Ba za su bar gidan ba.
There is help.	Akwai taimako.
They went right, they went right.	Sun tafi daidai, sun tafi daidai.
It doesn't come out much.	Bata fita da yawa.
I made a lot of money.	Na samu kudi da yawa.
It does not indicate how long we will stay in the water.	Bai nuna tsawon lokacin da za mu tsaya a cikin ruwa ba.
People say it's a good thing.	Mutane na cewa abu ne mai kyau.
The day is over.	Ranar ta wuce.
I have to get it right.	Dole ne in samu daidai.
He would not have done that.	Da ba zai yi hakan ba.
There is absolutely nothing to say.	Lallai babu abin da za a ce.
Now we have to go.	Yanzu dole ne mu tafi.
This is not just about me.	Wannan ba game da ni ba ne kawai.
You will die.	Za ku mutu.
You see.	Kun gani.
No more lies.	Babu sauran karya.
They certainly know better.	Lallai sun fi sani.
Not much has been said about it to date.	Ba a ce da yawa game da hakan ba har yau.
He understands people.	Ya fahimci mutane.
I want to give people things that change them.	Ina so in ba mutane abubuwan da ke canza su.
No sense.	Babu hankali.
I will block the road.	Zan tare hanya.
Everything is very nice.	Komai yayi kyau sosai.
I don't care what you say.	Ban damu da abin da kuke fada ba.
He told me to go.	Sai ya ce in tafi.
I found this a little weird.	Na sami wannan ɗan ban mamaki.
I really enjoy doing it.	Ina jin daɗin yin shi da gaske.
But they knew it.	Amma sun san shi.
I can't be alone here.	Ba zan iya zama ni kaɗai a nan ba.
Do your job.	Yi aikin ku.
If you are like me, people do not like you.	Idan ka kasance kamar ni, mutane ba su son ka.
No, no, no, no, no.	Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
He is a wonderful man.	Mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
I have to take care of my wife.	Dole ne in kula da mata na.
But there it is.	Amma akwai shi.
He protected me.	Ya kare ni.
They saw that something really happened.	Sun ga cewa wani abu ya faru da gaske.
If it is, fine.	Idan yana da, lafiya.
Just tried it.	Kamar ya gwada ta.
It's good for you.	Yana da kyau a gare ku.
Good things like this never happen to me.	Abubuwa masu kyau irin wannan ba su faru da ni ba.
The food must be explained.	Dole ne a bayyana abincin.
Maybe he is just waiting for someone else.	Wataƙila yana jiran wani ne kawai.
You can not say anything.	Ba za ku iya cewa komai ba.
I want a car to take me.	Ina so mota ta kai ni.
I'm sure now.	Na tabbata yanzu.
I will give them now.	Zan ba su yanzu.
And we are being passed over.	Kuma ana kai mu a wuce su.
From there help should come.	Daga nan ne ya kamata taimako ya zo.
This is definitely a development in the future.	Wannan tabbas ci gaba ne a nan gaba.
You will definitely get more than that.	Babu shakka za ku samu fiye da haka.
I have to stop talking about you.	Dole ne in daina magana game da ku.
You must now go with it.	Dole ne yanzu ka tafi da ita.
Really the place.	Da gaske wurin.
It fits.	Ya dace.
He could not trust me.	Ba zai iya yarda da ni ba.
Bring us some repairs, please.	Kawo mana kayan gyara, don Allah.
She thought he had achieved nothing.	Ta dauka bai kai ga komai ba.
We need to show that.	Muna bukatar mu nuna hakan.
Just stay in your room.	Kawai zauna a dakin ku.
In the end, this is exactly what happened.	A ƙarshe, abin da ya faru ke nan.
He didn't seem happy.	Da alama bai yi farin ciki ba.
To reach the house.	Don isa gidan.
It is not clear why he would have thought so.	Ba a bayyana dalilin da ya sa zai yi tunanin haka ba.
I hit the ground running.	Na buga kasa.
But nothing could be further from the truth.	Amma babu wani abu da ya kasance gaskiya.
She took the heat and won.	Ta dauki zafi ta yi nasara.
I saw the two of you around.	Na ga ku biyu a kusa.
No one made you go.	Babu wanda ya sa ku tafi.
Like what they say.	Kamar abin da suke cewa.
You are doing what you are supposed to do.	Kuna yin abin da ya kamata ku yi.
We agree that he does not need that.	Mun yarda cewa ba ya bukatar hakan.
And now you need to get up.	Kuma yanzu kuna buƙatar tashi.
And then we started.	Daga nan ma muka fara.
This, in general, is an interesting problem.	Wannan, a gaba ɗaya, matsala ce mai ban sha'awa.
I think you are not well.	Ina tsammanin ba ku da lafiya.
If he was right she looked like she was dead.	Idan ya yi gaskiya sai ta ga kamar ta mutu.
I think she has already put her behind.	Ina tsammanin ta riga ta sanya ta a baya.
It never flew again.	Bata sake tashi ba.
The plane was flying high and low.	Jirgin yana tashi sama da sama.
Here is what happened.	Abin da ke faruwa ke nan.
You will take it and buy it.	Za ka ɗauki sa ka saya.
Always before he let them love him.	Koyaushe kafin ya bar su su so shi.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Let me give you another one.	Bari in sake muku wani.
It is already there, always.	Yana nan riga, ko da yaushe.
We do not forget.	Ba mu manta .
No, that is not true.	A'a, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
He is a very active person.	Mutum ne mai yawan aiki.
They did not know she had heard them.	Ba su san ta ji su ba.
If that is what they are thinking, what can we do?	Idan abin da suke tunani ke nan, me za mu yi.
We'll let it go on that.	Za mu bar shi ya tafi a kan haka.
No one knows what to say.	Babu wanda ya san abin da zai ce.
He never touched me.	Bai taba taba ni ba.
We have never published favorites.	Ba mu taɓa buga abubuwan da aka fi so ba.
Two if it is in difficulty.	Biyu idan yana cikin wuya.
Then the second.	Sai na biyu.
And she failed to do so.	Kuma ta kasa yin hakan.
Don't sit down again.	Kada ku zauna kuma.
We can see that later.	Za mu iya kallon hakan daga baya.
He got up without speaking.	Ya tashi ba tare da yayi magana ba.
But first it has to change.	Amma na farko dole ne ya canza.
He did not know they were talking.	Bai san sun yi magana ba.
I love to laugh and have fun in everything.	Ina son yin dariya da samun ban dariya a kowane abu.
Leave me alone.	Ka bar min haka.
He told me not to go.	Ya ce min kar in tafi.
This has not been easy.	Wannan bai kasance mai sauƙi ba.
He will do it if he can.	Zai yi idan zai iya.
Not for everyone.	Ba don kowa ba.
Where do you work?	A ina kuke aiki?
So do not take it.	Don haka kada ku ɗauka.
It was on his own.	Ya kasance a kansa.
It is still not enough.	Har yanzu bai isa ba.
This is like something you are going to do.	Wannan kamar wani abu ne da za ku yi.
Tomorrow there is no doubt about it.	Gobe ​​babu shakka game da shi.
But do not be afraid, he is really dead!	Amma kada ka ji tsoro, ya mutu da gaske!
It's not that hard.	Ba haka ba ne mai wuya.
It is uncertain.	Ba shi da tabbas.
He is survived by three children.	Ya bar yara uku.
The two of you were happy to work together.	Ku biyu sun kasance farin cikin aiki tare.
I want to enter this room.	Ina so in shiga wannan dakin.
Do you like it now?	Kuna son shi yanzu?
In this way please.	Ta wannan hanyar don Allah.
He protected me.	Ya kare da ni.
That's why he sent.	Shi ya sa ya aika.
Everything is being fixed.	Ana gyara komai.
See where he is.	Duba inda yake.
It's nothing.	Bata ce komai ba.
Everything was in the past.	Duk abin da ya kasance a baya.
That is the kind of person.	Irin mutumin nan ke nan.
It is the work of man.	Aikin mutum ne.
You just want something.	Kuna son wani abu kawai.
Good job!	Kyakkyawan aiki!
It is very large.	Yana da girma sosai.
Which is not fair.	Wanda bai dace ba.
One day she returned two days a week.	Wata rana ta koma kwana biyu a mako.
I want to feel uncomfortable.	Ina so in ji ba dadi.
That should be it.	Wannan ya kamata ya kasance.
What was real.	Me ya kasance da gaske.
He used to do that a lot.	Ya kasance yana yin haka da yawa.
They should be used now.	Yakamata a yi aiki da su a yanzu.
And if you do not understand something, speak up.	Idan kuma ba ku fahimci wani abu ba, ku yi magana.
It has not been fixed yet.	Ba a gyara ba tukuna.
If someone is arrested, more will be involved.	Idan an kama wani, ƙarin zai shiga.
The sky is clear.	Sama yayi kyau.
I have to try something new.	Dole ne in gwada wani sabon abu.
They don’t see you for what you are.	Ba sa ganin ku don abin da kuke.
No more.	Babu sauran.
We should, how.	Ya kamata mu, ta yaya.
You just started.	Ka fara kawai.
The nights were cold.	Dare sun yi sanyi.
She was amazing.	Ta kasance mai ban sha'awa.
He knows who he is.	Ya san ko wanene shi.
They sing.	Suna yin waƙa.
And that's not necessarily because.	Kuma hakan ba lallai bane kuma saboda.
This is also happening.	Wannan ma yana faruwa.
Suddenly, with that name, everything changed.	Nan da nan, da wannan sunan, komai ya canza.
Another thing she said.	Wani abin kuma ta ce.
He could say it is not over.	Zai iya cewa bata gama ba.
Such a feeling must not be expressed here.	Dole ne kada a nuna irin wannan ji a nan.
We called him at work, but he was not there.	Mun kira shi a wurin aiki, amma ba ya nan.
I didn't get it all.	Ban samu duka ba.
But the tools should help you outdoors.	Amma kayan aikin yakamata su taimaka muku waje.
I feel without anyone who will hear it.	Ina ji ba tare da wanda zai ji shi ba.
Maybe you have already stopped smoking.	Wataƙila ka daina shan taba tukuna.
Drink water.	Ruwa ta sha.
We have to get it.	Dole ne mu samu.
I felt like it was appropriate.	Na ji kamar ya dace.
We have to make money.	Dole ne mu sami kuɗi.
So she brought it out.	Da haka ta fito da ita.
We want to talk to you.	Muna so mu yi magana da ku.
It was an amazing opportunity.	Dama dama ce mai ban mamaki.
She asked for a delay.	Ta nemi a bata lokaci.
We too.	Mu kuma.
Even a lot of backwards.	Ko da yawa na baya.
You are the best thing that has ever happened to me.	Kai ne mafi kyawun abin da ya taɓa faruwa da ni.
The program was successful.	Shirin yayi nasara.
Of course.	Ya tabbata.
He ate it with the taste of delicious food.	Ya ci tare da jin daɗin abinci mai daɗi.
Everyone talked to me.	Kowa yayi min magana.
I hate that.	Na ƙi hakan.
Do not hope they will understand.	Kada ku yi fatan za su gane.
Now for the rest of what she said.	Yanzu ga sauran abin da ta ce.
Now everything is back.	Yanzu komai ya dawo.
Probably not.	Wataƙila ba za ku kasance ba.
Do not dwell on the past.	Kada ku yi tunani a kan abin da ya gabata.
This works really well.	Wannan yana aiki sosai.
I have to be good.	Dole ne in kasance mai kyau.
No one did that to him.	Ba wanda ya yi masa haka.
We have to pay for food.	Dole ne mu biya abinci.
He is a symbolic man.	Mutum ne mai alama.
They never agreed to anything.	Ba su taɓa yarda da komai ba.
He himself is a marvel.	Shi kansa abin mamaki ne.
He could not sit still.	Ya kasa zama.
I like.	Ina son.
She is not human.	Ita ba mutum ba ce.
It happens to some people.	Yana faruwa ga wasu mutane.
I think she wants me to help her get something from someone else.	Ina tsammanin tana so in taimake ta ta sami wani abu daga wurin wani.
I did not know they changed the name.	Ban san sun canza sunan ba.
To get them for himself.	Don samun su don kansa.
Think big.	Yi tunani mai girma.
Some things to do.	Wasu abubuwan da za a yi.
You can save it if you want.	Kuna iya ajiye shi idan kuna so.
Nothing right now.	Ba komai yanzu.
Not for nothing.	Ba don komai ba.
You can laugh a lot.	Kuna iya dariya sosai.
There is no time when you can have that.	Babu wani lokacin da za ku iya samun hakan.
They look scared.	Sun yi kama da tsoro.
Stay there and be safe.	Ku kasance a can kuma ku kasance lafiya.
She enjoys reading music.	Tana jin daɗin karanta waƙa.
After she sat down she ate fast.	Bayan ta zauna ta ci abinci da sauri.
It may be better.	Yana iya zama mafi kyau.
But that is what he did.	Amma abin da ya yi ke nan.
When she needs your help, give it to her.	Lokacin da take buƙatar taimakon ku, ku ba shi.
Give it a year or two.	Ka ba shi shekara ɗaya ko biyu.
This last attempt was successful.	Wannan ƙoƙari na ƙarshe ya yi nasara.
Once, and once, he was here.	Sau ɗaya, kuma sau ɗaya, ya kasance a nan.
A beautiful place and a great thing.	Kyakkyawan wuri kuma abu ne mai girma.
It can not.	Yana iya ba.
Before entering.	Kafin ya shiga.
It’s just a tool for her.	Kayan aiki ne kawai a gare ta.
That was easy.	Hakan ya kasance mai sauƙi.
Remember them, remember them well !.	Ku tuna su, ku tuna da su da kyau!.
We decided to swim.	Mun yanke shawarar yin iyo.
How right they are.	Yaya daidai suke.
But he must accept it.	Amma dole ne ya yarda.
He knows that too.	Ya san haka ma.
He lost to the best man of the year.	Ya yi rashin nasara ga mutumin da ya fi shekara mafi kyau.
Sometimes you succeed.	Wani lokaci ka yi nasara.
This should be more useful.	Wannan ya kamata ya zama mafi amfani.
Still see such work.	Duk da haka gani irin wannan aikin.
There they spent the first night.	Can suka kwana na farko.
Outside inside.	Waje a ciki.
It has been a long wait.	An dade ana jira.
Later they corrected.	Daga baya suka gyara.
The story has always been that.	Labarin ya kasance koyaushe.
However, this is not necessary.	Duk da haka, wannan ba lallai ba ne.
Inside, the room was almost empty.	A ciki, dakin ya kusa zama babu kowa.
Later it got hot.	Daga baya ya samu zafi.
It didn't take long for him.	Tsawon lokaci bai yi masa ba.
Now, really.	Yanzu, sosai.
It seems that nothing has changed.	Kamar babu abin da ya canza.
I want to continue.	Ina so in ci gaba.
The rest of the ship left him behind.	Sauran jirgin ya bar shi a baya.
He said nothing but this.	Bai ce komai ba sai wannan.
Future story.	Labarin nan gaba.
I do not want to tell you.	Ban so in gaya muku ba.
Good job with that.	Kyakkyawan aiki tare da wannan.
It has to be true.	Dole ne ya zama gaskiya.
No one will tell me anything.	Ba wanda zai gaya mani komai.
I certainly never did.	Lallai ban taba yi ba.
That's it, the end.	Shi ke nan, karshen.
I have read this many times.	Na karanta wannan sau da yawa.
And it will not be corrected.	Kuma ba za a yi masa gyara ba.
I will leave the car for you.	Zan bar muku motar.
She prefers the outdoors.	Ta fi son waje.
Some are like you and me.	Wasu kamar ni da kai ne.
No one is really doing that.	Babu wani mutum da gaske yake yin haka.
I can put it on.	Zan iya sanya shi.
Running is good for us.	Gudu ne mai kyau a gare mu.
Home time.	Lokacin gida.
First.	Na farko.
Here is our next suspect.	Ga wanda ake zargin mu na gaba.
They have a single oil for each use.	Suna da mai guda ɗaya don kowane amfani.
You will not get it right the first time.	Ba za ku samu daidai lokacin farko ba.
I missed her.	Na rasa ta.
When police arrived, the man was arrested.	Lokacin da 'yan sanda suka isa, an kama mutumin.
You have to be very careful.	Dole ne ku yi hankali sosai.
I think something is wrong.	Ina tsammanin wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
But you have to go.	Amma dole ne ku tafi.
It looks like something is dead.	Ga alama wani abu ya mutu.
I sat on it.	Na zauna a kai.
You will learn a lot about yourself by doing so.	Za ku koyi abubuwa da yawa game da kanku ta yin hakan.
Certainly not.	Lallai abin bai yi kyau ba.
But it was a close thing.	Amma ya kasance abu na kusa.
Stay with us, and tell us what you know.	Zauna tare da mu, kuma gaya mana abin da ka sani.
That will work.	Hakan zai yi amfani.
But nothing stopped.	Amma babu abin da ya tsaya.
He will never go.	Ba zai taba tafiya ba.
This is getting amazing.	Wannan yana samun ban mamaki.
At first it seemed like he didn't hear.	Da farko kamar bai ji ba.
With that, he is a member of the family.	Da wannan, dan gidan ne.
Hear, but do not hear.	Ji, amma ba ji ba.
So you live, for a while.	Don haka kuna rayuwa, na ɗan lokaci.
, same to you.	, kuma.
Just do it.	A yi kawai.
But let's not talk about it.	Amma kada mu yi magana game da shi.
Now that you have read this article, you are well prepared.	Yanzu da kuka karanta wannan labarin, kun shirya sosai.
Now he himself is dead.	Yanzu shi kansa ya mutu.
We can have that.	Za mu iya samun hakan.
You can't change anything that happened.	Ba za ku iya canza wani abu da ya faru ba.
That will be.	Hakan zai kasance .
I certainly never thought so, nor did I say.	Lallai ban taba tunanin haka ba, ko kuma na ce.
It is good to think carefully.	Yana da kyau a yi tunani sosai.
I will join.	Zan shiga.
Who will do it once, twice for her.	Wanda zai yi masa sau daya, sau biyu a gare ta.
To do this we need a home loan that will stay at home.	Don yin haka muna buƙatar kuɗin gida wanda zai zauna a gida.
We realized he was drinking a lot of water.	Mun fahimci yana shan ruwa sosai.
I will stop doing it soon.	Zan daina yin hakan da sauri.
You must look for someone else.	Dole ne ku nemi wani.
But nothing.	Amma ba komai.
You are not very good.	Ba ku da kyau sosai.
I want to tell myself it will never happen.	Ina so in gaya wa kaina ba zai taba faruwa ba.
I don't think they know what to do with me.	Ba na jin sun san abin da za su yi da ni.
You can not defend yourself.	Ba za ku iya kare kanku ba.
So you know it's good.	Don haka ka san yana da kyau.
That was a few years ago.	Shekaru kadan da suka gabata kenan.
It's so good.	Yana da kyau haka.
Help is good.	Taimakon yana da kyau.
She could be true to him, until she died.	Ta iya zama gaskiya gare shi, har ta mutu.
It must be done.	Dole ne a yi.
He felt unseen.	Ya ji ba gani ba.
No matter who.	Komai wanene.
We are inside.	Muna ciki.
How often do you have a child?	Sau nawa kuke tare da yaro?.
I want it written.	Ina so a rubuta shi.
At first it seemed like a good idea.	Da farko hakan yana kama da kyakkyawan tunani.
You want people to want to help you.	Kuna son mutane su so su taimake ku.
She thought of every day that came.	Ta yi tunanin kowace rana da ta zo.
This is the annual event.	Wannan shi ne taron shekara.
But next time.	Amma a karo na gaba.
Is there anyone who can, please?	Shin akwai wanda zai iya, don Allah?
No one wanted to go near him.	Ba wanda ya so ya je kusa da shi.
I recommend the latter, though.	Ina ba da shawarar karshen, ko da yake.
Hope we are together before he leaves.	Fata mu kasance tare kafin ya tafi.
We decided to have a wedding at home.	Mun yanke shawarar yin bikin aure a gida.
They are not dead.	Ba su mutu ba.
For a little.	Don kadan.
Although something interesting happened.	Ko da yake wani abu mai ban sha'awa ya faru.
Do it any way you want.	Yi ta duk hanyar da kuke so.
It may be for you.	Yana iya zama a gare ku.
To kill something.	Don kashe wani abu.
But he can't.	Amma ba zai iya ba.
All the best in the end.	Duk mafi kyau a ƙarshe.
And we worked.	Kuma mun yi aiki.
How much more?	Akwai kuma nawa?.
We love you so much, so much.	Muna son ku haka, sosai.
She still has to call.	Har yanzu dole ta kira.
I'm not sure at the moment.	Ban tabbata ba a wannan lokacin.
Where we grew up.	Inda muka girma.
We can not even this now.	Ba za mu iya ko da wannan a yanzu.
But he never came.	Amma bai taba zuwa ba.
He loves this.	Yana son wannan.
She felt like she was.	Ta ji kamar ita ce ita.
She did.	Ta yi haka.
This is metal.	Wannan karfe ne.
This thing will kill you.	Wannan abu zai kashe ku.
I will even join you.	Zan ma shiga ku.
That was in time, though.	Wannan ya kasance a cikin lokaci, duk da haka.
I can only speak for myself.	Zan iya magana da kaina kawai.
Children are more vulnerable.	Yara sun fi samun rauni.
But let's try it again.	Amma bari mu sake gwada shi sau ɗaya.
There are only.	Akwai kawai.
We are waiting for him to come back tomorrow.	Muna jiran ya dawo gobe.
I have no problem.	Ba ni da wata matsala.
He is OK today.	Ya kasance lafiya yau.
He did not speak.	Bata yi magana ba.
Water was not brought to the station.	Ba a kawo ruwa a tashar ba.
Not even for you.	Ba ma na ku ba.
That's a good statement.	Magana ce mai kyau.
In the end maybe it worked for the better.	A ƙarshe watakila ya yi aiki don mafi kyau.
He was there twice.	Ya kasance a can sau biyu.
You read inside and see what you think.	Kuna karanta a ciki kuma ku ga abin da kuke tunani.
Get out, get out, get out.	Fita, fita, fita.
This made him walk faster.	Hakan yasa shi tafiya da sauri.
But try it.	Amma gwada shi.
On top of that they will make us accept this.	A kan haka za su sa mu yarda da wannan.
This is not a new idea.	Wannan ba sabon tunani bane.
She will be a woman.	Za ta zama mata.
It is very helpful but delicious.	Yana da matukar taimako amma dadi.
But then, it starts to feel good.	Amma sai, sai an fara jin daɗi.
It's good.	Yana da kyau.
Much has developed since then.	Da yawa sun ci gaba tun daga lokacin.
It's just the way it is.	A hanya ne kawai.
They can't, they can't help him.	Ba za su iya ba, ba za su iya taimaka masa ba.
Sorry to be you.	Yi hakuri ya zama ku.
It will never be restored.	Ba za a taba dawo da shi yadda ya saba ba.
I am very sad.	Ina matukar bakin ciki.
They don't like them.	Ba su so su.
There is no doubt she can use it.	Ba shi da shakka za ta iya amfani da shi.
Nothing has happened since.	Babu wani abu da ya faru tun lokacin.
It's very difficult, though.	Yana da matukar wuya, ko da yake.
It's close by.	Yana kusa da wurin.
It can work.	Yana iya aiki.
You or someone else.	Kai ko wani.
How very interesting.	Yaya ban sha'awa sosai.
It was necessary at the time.	Ya zama dole a lokacin.
I do not like this.	Ba na son wannan.
Not a bad job.	Ba mummunan aiki ba.
He is a sad man.	Mutumin bakin ciki ne.
Everything works, so it is not necessary.	Komai yana aiki, don haka ba dole bane.
And it killed our game.	Kuma ya kashe mu wasan.
I will do this in the morning.	Zan yi haka da safe.
She is very beautiful.	Tana da kyau sosai.
No one came out.	Babu wanda ya fito.
And everyone, like everyone else, is working.	Kuma duk, kamar kowa, yana aiki.
That you and him will stay here with us now.	Cewa ku da shi za ku zauna a nan tare da mu yanzu.
It's amazing!	Yana da ban mamaki!
I had no idea where this would lead to.	Ban yi tunanin inda wannan zai kai ga ba.
But these were only discovered later.	Amma waɗannan ne kawai aka gano daga baya.
How wonderful.	Yaya matukar ban mamaki.
I feel good.	Na ji dadi.
See, he did not say this was not true.	Duba, bai ce wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
And it can be closed twice.	Kuma ana iya rufe shi sau biyu.
I do not know where.	Ban san a ina ba.
No matter what happens, keep trying to do your best.	Komai ya faru, ci gaba da ƙoƙarin yin mafi kyau.
Funny, how it works.	Abin ban dariya, yadda yake aiki haka.
No flight scheduled today.	Babu jirgin da aka shirya yau.
He killed one of us.	Ya kashe daya daga cikin mu.
I have not decided.	Na yanke shawarar ba.
And they do.	Kuma da suke yi.
It's a great place.	Wani babban wuri ne.
Then there is no way.	Daga nan babu wata hanya.
Go slowly.	Tafi a hankali.
Dinner at home because, as everyone knows, the kids ate.	Abincin dare a gida saboda, kamar yadda kowa ya sani, yara sun ci abinci.
And he was worried.	Kuma ya damu.
She is known for her honesty.	An san ta da gaskiya.
Need to travel together, work together, see together.	Bukatar tafiya tare, aiki tare, gani tare.
They have nothing and need everything.	Ba su da komai kuma suna buƙatar komai.
I learned a lot so.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa saboda haka.
Who knows where it will be next week.	Wa ya san inda zai kasance mako mai zuwa.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
Let them speak.	Su yi magana.
It came out really well.	Ya fito sosai.
No waiting.	Ba a jira ba.
I'll keep it.	Zan ajiye shi.
And sometimes it’s big, and sometimes it’s not good.	Kuma wani lokacin yana da girma, wani lokacin kuma ba ya da kyau.
I only eat one meal a day, with plenty of water.	Ina cin abinci ɗaya kawai a rana, da ruwa mai yawa.
Not just for me but for you as well.	Ba don ni kaɗai ba amma a gare ku ma.
I don't want anything from you.	Bana son wani abu daga gare ku.
The time is not right.	Lokaci bai dace ba.
They have the same feeling wherever you go.	Suna da irin wannan jin duk inda kuka je.
You have the opportunity to speak.	Kuna da damar yin magana.
There is, however, a big problem.	Akwai, duk da haka, babban matsala.
He doesn’t have much on his own.	Ba shi da yawa a kansa.
I want to work with you.	Ina son yin aiki tare da ku.
No one ever knows why it happened.	Ba wanda ya taɓa sanin dalilin da ya sa abin ya faru.
Or even higher.	Ko haka kuma mafi girma.
Untruth.	Rashin gaskiya.
They grow faster and faster.	Sun fi girma da sauri.
How can one prove this?	Ta yaya mutum zai iya tabbatar da hakan?
That's right.	Hakan yayi daidai.
I keep it all here.	Ina ajiye duka a nan.
Something there caught the sun.	Wani abu a wurin ya kama rana.
It's hard to let it go.	Yana da wuya a bar shi ya tafi.
He just laughed.	Yayi dariya kawai.
His head seemed bigger.	Kansa kamar ya fi girma.
It is not an easy thing to do.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi a yi ba.
At first, these things surprised him.	Da farko waɗannan abubuwan sun ba shi mamaki.
I'm sure about that.	Ina jin tabbas game da wannan.
They all want to make the world a better place.	Duk suna son yin kyau ta duniya.
We can use it.	Za mu iya amfani da shi.
I fixed it.	Na gyara shi.
The place is empty.	Wurin ba komai bane.
That's why people have to pay you to work.	Shi ya sa dole ne mutane su biya ku don yin aiki.
Let her think she is as healthy as one can be.	Bari yayi tunanin ta kasance lafiya kamar yadda mutum zai iya zama.
I will not marry him.	Ba zan aure shi ba.
What a delicious.	Abin da dadi.
He had no reason to kill her.	Ba shi da dalilin kashe ta.
Who did this?	Wanene ya yi wannan?
I have never seen anything like it.	Ban taba ganin irin wannan ba.
When you meet yourself.	Lokacin da kuka hadu da kanku.
This is now given to us.	Wannan yanzu an ba mu.
These are just opportunities.	Waɗannan su ne kawai damar.
Of course they were wrong.	Tabbas sun yi kuskure.
They worked at night.	Sun yi aiki cikin dare.
He said no, he could not, it would not be appropriate.	Ya ce a'a, ba zai iya ba, ba zai dace ba.
I do not have to be happy about that.	Ba lallai ne na yi farin ciki da hakan ba.
He seemed interested in talking to me.	Ya yi kamar yana sha'awar magana da ni.
I thought ahead of my next meal.	Na yi tunani gaba da cin abinci na gaba.
I do not want to talk.	Ba na son magana.
That doesn't work, of course.	Wannan ba ya aiki, ba shakka.
Of course, they have a lot of food.	Tabbas, suna da abinci da yawa.
Laugh at school.	Dariya a makaranta.
Have you lost your appetite?	Shin kun rasa ci?
I'll be honest here.	Zan yi gaskiya a nan.
This material is interesting.	Wannan kayan yana da ban sha'awa.
He wanted to do it, but he wanted to be sure.	Ya so ya yi, amma ya so ya tabbata.
But nothing.	Amma babu komai.
Come to us.	Ku zo mana.
It will never happen.	Ba zai taba faruwa ba.
She was him.	Ta kasance shi.
Whatever you think.	Duk abin da kuke tunani.
We are coming after everyone.	Muna zuwa bayan kowa.
When looked at carefully, things seemed to be real.	Lokacin da aka duba da kyau, abubuwan sun zama kamar na gaske.
And he told me they must.	Kuma ya ce mini dole ne su.
To be honest.	A gaskiya.
This makes it even more interesting.	Wannan ya sa ya fi ban sha'awa.
Not really, no.	Ba gaske ba, a'a.
Nothing real, and no one was hurt.	Babu wani abu na gaske, kuma babu wanda ya ji rauni.
They have never happened before.	Ba su taɓa faruwa a baya ba.
So let me come back here.	Don haka bari in dawo nan.
This is the hardest.	Wannan shi ne mafi wuya.
If this sounds like you, try it out.	Idan wannan yayi kama da ku, gwada shi.
They have so many wonderful things.	Suna da abubuwa masu ban mamaki da yawa.
She could not be alone.	Ba ta iya zama ita kaɗai ba.
He used it well.	Ya yi amfani da shi sosai.
Do not see anything.	Kada ku ga komai.
I can't tell how it turned out.	Ba zan iya gaya yadda abin ya kasance ba.
He enjoys talking to other people.	Yana jin daɗin magana da sauran mutane.
You are not the one others think you are.	Ba kai bane wanda wasu suke tunanin kai ne.
I will let them in.	Zan bar su su shiga.
I sat down, for the second time in the morning.	Na zauna, a karo na biyu da safe.
If nothing else.	Idan ba komai ba ne.
Or you have too much water.	Ko kuma kuna da ruwa mai yawa.
I got my chance.	Na samu dama ta.
Let's wait and go out at night.	Mu tsaya a jira mu fita dare.
We can live in misery together but not together.	Za mu iya rayuwa cikin wahala tare amma ba tare ba.
However, there are some weaknesses.	Duk da haka, akwai wasu rauni.
She closed, he saw.	Ta rufe, ya gani.
Let's be together.	Bari mu kasance tare.
Not there.	Ba a can ba.
We were told to get up and run.	Sai aka ce mana ya tashi ya gudu.
There is no easy way, is there?	Babu wata hanya mai sauƙi, akwai?
That's what we caught.	Haka muka kama.
No one would call such a.	Ba wanda zai kira irin wannan.
But it will not happen.	Amma ba zai faru ba.
Just love it.	Kawai son shi.
I don't understand why he is here.	Ban gane dalilin da ya sa yake nan ba.
She did nothing.	Ba ta yi komai ba.
Buy coffee.	Sayi kofi.
Some got up last night to drink.	Wasu sun tashi a daren jiya suna sha.
They do not know why we feel that way.	Ba su san mu ba ne dalilin da ya sa suke jin haka.
She is amazing.	Tana da ban mamaki.
That is why he is so successful.	Abin da ya sa ya samu nasara kenan.
She did not know what to do.	Bata san me zata yi ba.
In the past, well, it was right.	A baya, da kyau, ya kasance daidai.
If only he could reach them.	Idan zai iya isa gare su kawai.
Now get up.	Yanzu tashi.
Maybe they won't.	Wataƙila ba za su so ba.
She hopes there is a place.	Ta yi fatan akwai wuri.
I feel like everything you told me is fake.	Ina ji kamar duk abin da ka gaya mani karya ne.
He should be told he is there.	Sai a gaya masa yana nan.
I learned to drink.	Na koyi sha.
Whenever it rained they would go home.	Duk lokacin da aka yi ruwan sama sai su koma gida.
I'm sure she won't too.	Na tabbata ita ma ba za ta yi ba.
I have to tell you.	Dole ne in gaya muku.
And this is a day like that.	Kuma wannan rana ce irin wannan.
So they did what he said.	Don haka suka yi abin da ya ce.
There is a lot of money in it.	Akwai kudi masu yawa a ciki.
In fact, she did not plan it.	A gaskiya ita ma ba ta shirya shi ba.
It is a global problem.	Matsala ce ta duniya.
She did not come.	Ba ta zo ba.
They placed third.	Sun sanya na uku.
From the man himself.	Daga mutumin da kansa.
It all looked like a trip plan, as follows.	Duk ya yi kama da shirin tafiya, kamar haka.
Of course you know.	Tabbas kun sani.
He never laughed.	Bai taba dariya ba.
The cost goes up fast!	Kuɗin yana ƙara da sauri!
I beg to differ.	Ban yarda ba.
And you know how it is.	Kuma ka san yadda take.
It's not that cold.	Bai yi sanyi haka ba.
I would like to have a three-day weekend.	Ina son samun karshen mako na kwana uku.
Through.	Saboda.
This is the last one.	Wannan shine na ƙarshe.
I almost felt uncomfortable about it.	Na kusa ji ba dadi game da shi.
In fact you missed it altogether.	A gaskiya ka rasa shi gaba ɗaya.
She will succeed.	Za ta yi nasara.
Make money, get everything.	Yi kudi, sami komai.
At that moment, it was too late to tell.	A wannan lokacin, ya yi wuri ba za a iya faɗa ba.
I have nothing to laugh about.	Ba ni da wani abin dariya da zan ce.
Still available.	Har yanzu akwai.
You do not want anything in it.	Ba ku son komai da shi.
We still miss a few things though.	Har yanzu muna rasa 'yan abubuwa ko da yake.
This allows people to know who won.	Wannan yana ba mutane damar sanin wanda ya yi nasara.
Give him a good month.	Ka ba shi wata mai kyau.
He could not remember the past.	Ya kasa tuna abin da ya gabata.
Find something to eat.	Sami abin da za ku ci.
It is very hot again.	Ranar ta sake yin zafi sosai.
This is something real.	Wannan wani abu ne na gaske.
We do not know where we are going to take you.	Ba mu san inda za mu kai ku ba.
The moon will rise early.	Wata zai tashi da wuri.
And he did not even know it.	Kuma bai ma san shi ba.
And nothing could be further from the truth.	Kuma babu wani abu da ya kasance gaskiya.
Not a good answer.	Ba amsa mai kyau ba.
We have succeeded.	Mun samu nasara.
I died to see you.	Na mutu don ganin ku.
We are not finished yet.	Ba mu gama ba tukuna.
Make it work for everything.	Ka sa shi aiki don komai.
You want the truth.	Kuna son gaskiya.
I remember everything now.	Ina tuna kowane abu yanzu.
It is a real place.	Wuri ne na gaske.
If one is above one below, the request is granted.	Idan daya yana sama daya kasa, an ba da bukatar.
Some sweet thoughts.	Wasu tunani masu dadi.
She decided that it must be.	Ta yanke shawarar cewa dole ne.
Until it is too late.	Har sai an makara.
Even if you feel you must.	Ko da kun ji dole ne ku.
I wanted to go with her.	Na so in tafi da ita.
That sounds good to me.	Wannan yayi min kyau.
We took the right person.	Mun dauki mutumin da ya dace.
To make things faster, she used to work.	Don yin abubuwa cikin sauri, ta kasance tana aiki.
So we went in and he showed us a little bit.	Haka muka shiga ya dan nuna mana.
But she did not hear.	Amma bata ji ba.
Everything went well and we sold the house.	Komai ya tafi da kyau muka sayar da gidan.
Maybe we should be honest and truthful.	Wataƙila ya kamata mu kasance masu gaskiya da gaskiya.
On top of that, you have a man.	A kan haka, kuna da wani mutum.
You will feel right at home here.	Za ku ji daidai a gida a nan.
However, he was surprised.	Duk da haka, ya sha mamaki.
She will wait.	Zata jira.
Think of how you would do it.	Ka yi mini tunani yadda za ka yi.
They used to go to school, work.	Sun kasance suna zuwa makaranta, suna aiki.
If it is good, people will buy it.	Idan yana da kyau, mutane za su saya.
But you are ahead.	Amma kuna gaba.
Sometimes, it just works by.	Wani lokaci, yana aiki ne kawai ta hanyar.
We can not say them more than we can do them.	Ba za mu iya ce da su fiye da yadda za mu iya yi su.
He drinks a lot.	Yana sha da yawa.
But that's it.	Amma shi ke nan.
I started walking again.	Na fara tafiya kuma.
I understand that you are not ready to talk yet.	Na gane cewa ba ku shirya yin magana ba tukuna.
Or you may not feel the need to ask for more.	Ko wataƙila ba ka jin bai dace a nemi ƙarin ba.
It feels cold.	Ji yayi sanyi.
She never did well.	Ba ta taɓa yin kyau ba.
Or something, really.	Ko wani abu, da gaske.
Little has changed.	Kadan ya canza.
It must have made him very ill.	Wataƙila ya sa shi rashin lafiya sosai.
They are here now.	Yanzu suna nan.
He told him to stop.	Yace masa ya tsaya.
Let no one say we cannot work.	Kada wani ya ce ba za mu iya yin aiki ba.
He does not go out again.	Baya fita kuma.
More money.	Ƙarin kuɗi.
I think it was good.	Ina tsammanin abin ya kasance da kyau.
Nothing was wrong.	Babu wani abu da ya kasance matsala.
And if it helps you fix it.	Kuma idan ya kasance kun taimaka gyara shi.
They don't like it.	Ba su so shi.
Prepare to enter it.	Shirya shiga ta.
Real work.	Ainihin aiki.
Did you forget something?	Baka manta wani abu bane?
This is easier and more comfortable.	Wannan ya fi sauƙi kuma mafi daɗi.
I could not answer correctly.	Na kasa amsa da kyau.
Let everyone sleep.	Bari kowa yayi barci.
She didn't need to talk, either.	Babu bukatar ta ta yi magana, ni ma.
I ran here.	Na gudu a nan.
It rained a lot, but the rain stopped.	An yi ruwan sama mai yawa, amma ruwan sama ya daina.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
They knew it was coming.	Sun san yana zuwa.
We were never harmed.	Ba a taɓa yi mana komai ba.
They do nothing.	Ba sa yin komai.
No one comes to hear you.	Ba wanda ya zo ya ji ka.
She has known this for years.	Ta san wannan tsawon shekaru.
He came back a year ago.	Ya dawo shekara guda da ta wuce.
Of course this is a mistake to make.	Tabbas wannan kuskure ne a yi wa wani.
He can't do that.	Ba zai iya yin haka ba.
It does the job for you.	Yana yi muku aikin.
Often.	Sau da yawa .
Maybe he will do it honestly.	Wataƙila zai yi shi da gaskiya.
And he asks you what you are doing.	Kuma ya tambaye ku me kuke yi.
We'll see what tomorrow looks like.	Za mu ga yadda gobe za ta kasance.
Here we go.	Mu je zuwa.
Many of the crowd were not happy.	Da yawa daga cikin taron ba su ji daɗi ba.
I can see them all at the same time.	Ina iya ganin su duka a lokaci guda.

I have to tell you.	Dole ne in gaya muku.
There is something for everyone here.	Akwai wani abu ga kowa a nan.

Do what you can.	Yi abin da za ku iya.
You are the only one.	Kai ne kawai.
Let it come.	Bari ya zo.
I checked it several times.	Na duba shi sau da yawa.
And no game next week.	Kuma babu wasa a mako mai zuwa.
Leave her like.	Bar ta kamar .
A little is good.	Kadan yana da kyau.
Do not take more than that	Kada ku ɗauka fiye da haka
The one you have now.	Wanda kuke da shi a yanzu.
There are so many things we need to do together.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ya kamata mu yi tare.
Give him some time to work.	Ba shi ɗan lokaci don yin aiki.
But he is still walking.	Amma har yanzu yana tafiya.
That has changed today.	Hakan ya canza a yau.
He said exactly how he was.	Ya fada daidai yadda yake.
I learned some.	Na koyi wasu.
All of them may just not be tested.	Duk suna iya kawai ba a gwada su ba.
We saw each other.	Mun ga juna.
Now, let's take a look.	Yanzu, bari mu duba.
Go and do something good for someone else.	Je ka yi wani abu mai kyau ga wani.
I thought so.	Na yi tsammanin haka.
We are not finished with you yet.	Har yanzu ba mu gama da ku ba.
Tell him the story from the beginning.	Ba shi labarin tun daga farko.
We did really well with them.	Mun yi kyau sosai da su.
Do not try to find it.	Kada ku yi ƙoƙarin gano shi.
He is in a car.	Yana cikin mota.
I'm tired of it.	Na gaji da shi.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu wani abu da zai yi daidai.
I did not buy it!	Ba na saya ba!
And if she gets too close, he can kill her.	Kuma idan ta yi kusa sosai, zai iya kashe ta.
This is just to start someone else.	Wannan shine kawai don fara wani.
She cares about people.	Ta damu da mutane.
I touched her gently.	Na taba ta a hankali.
I was amazed at how it turned out.	Na yi mamakin yadda ta kasance.
You are not the only one who can make life very difficult.	Ba ku kaɗai ba ne za ku iya sa rayuwa ta yi wahala sosai.
She went and did it now.	Ta tafi ta yi yanzu.
Wherever people eat or drink.	Duk inda mutane suke ci ko sha.
They have not spoken to him yet.	Ba su yi magana da shi ba tukuna.
Just as cold as you can get in this heat.	Kamar sanyi kamar yadda za ku iya samu a cikin wannan zafi.
Maybe he agrees.	Watakila ya yarda.
Everything should be fine now.	Komai yakamata yayi kyau yanzu.
Do not be intimidated.	Kada tsoro ya kama ku.
I thought to myself there.	Na yi tunanin kaina a can.
She could not and could not.	Ba za ta iya ba kuma ba za ta iya ba.

And she prefers it.	Kuma ta fi so saboda haka.
All of this is definitely true.	Duk waɗannan tabbas gaskiya ne.

I decided to publish it.	Na yanke shawarar buga shi.
We want that to stop.	Muna son hakan ya tsaya.
I see no need to move on.	Na ga babu bukatar ci gaba.
And he will save her.	Kuma zai ajiye mata.
But that does not happen.	Amma hakan baya faruwa.
Many people have heard that.	Mutane da yawa sun ji haka.
It happens a lot.	Yana faruwa da yawa.
One has to get help there.	Dole ne mutum ya sami taimako a can.
We still do not know what the reason is.	Har yanzu ba mu san ko menene dalilin ba.
This food is good.	Wannan abincin ya yi kyau.
It's amazing to be so.	Yana da ban mamaki zama da shi haka.
My head hurts.	Kaina ya yi zafi.
This is exactly what to say.	Wannan shi ne daidai abin da za a ce.

She is the one he loves the most.	Ita ce yake matukar so.
They wanted to kill me.	Sun so su kashe ni.
Honestly I don't know.	Gaskiya ban sani ba.
The main reason ,.	Babban dalilin,.
It is well spent money.	Kudi ne da aka kashe da kyau.
The journey continued for a while after that.	An ci gaba da tafiya na ɗan lokaci bayan haka.
In the future.	Zuwa gaba.
For some people.	Ga wasu mutane.

It does not seem so.	Da alama ba haka bane.
You do not need it.	Ba ku buƙatar shi.

But somehow we made it work.	Amma ko ta yaya muka sanya shi aiki.
He knew she was coming but he was surprised.	Ya san tana zuwa amma hakan ya bashi mamaki.
He must have made a mistake.	Dole ne yayi kuskure.
However, the plan failed.	Duk da haka, shirin ya yi kuskure.
He killed him.	Ya kashe shi.
I know it's good for me.	Na san yana da kyau a gare ni.
Police have not identified his whereabouts.	'Yan sanda ba su gano inda ya shiga ba.
And you can get what you want easily and quickly.	Kuma za ku iya samun abin da kuke so cikin sauƙi da sauri.
I also know it is good for him.	Ni kuma na san yana da kyau a gare shi.
It can be anyone.	Yana iya zama kowa.
He proved himself.	Ya tabbatar ma kansa.
They are all fulfilled.	Duk suka cika.
This is a good thing to remember.	Wannan abu ne mai kyau a tuna.
People have already gone there.	Mutane sun riga sun tafi can.

It will take some time before you get there.	Zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci kafin isa wurin.
It works overall.	Yana aiki gaba ɗaya.
Last.	A ƙarshe.
He did not even speak to her at the time.	A lokacin bai ma yi mata magana ba.
You do not know how long they live around waiting.	Ba ka san tsawon lokacin da suke zaune a kusa da jira.
He does not want to see that.	Ba ya son ganin haka.
Or so he said.	Ko haka ya fada.
You have to protect it.	Dole ne ku kare shi.
They will never do.	Ba za su taba yi ba.
It was really amazing to me.	Abin ban mamaki sosai a gare ni da gaske.
Think so.	Ka yi tunanin haka.

Now she has one.	Yanzu ta sami daya.
But if they are close to the road.	Amma idan sun kasance kusa da hanya.

Someone knew where he stood.	Wani mutum ya san inda ya tsaya.
Tell me this.	Fada mani wannan.
Not with me, but with her.	Ba tare da ni ba, amma tare da ita.
Many others became ill.	Wasu da yawa sun yi rashin lafiya.

In fact, no one.	A gaskiya, babu kowa.

I gave him money if he would let me do something.	Na ba shi kudi idan zai bar ni in yi wani abu.
No work after that.	Babu aiki bayan wannan.
And she knew there had been a fight.	Kuma ta san da an yi fada.
I want her to keep thinking that way.	Ina son ta ci gaba da tunanin haka har.
Is this article useful?	Shin wannan labarin yana da amfani?
You may want to get out of this early.	Kuna iya so ku fita daga wannan da wuri.
Maybe we saw it coming, but we didn’t.	Wataƙila da mun ga yana zuwa, amma ba mu yi ba.
This is a really good thing.	Wannan abu ne mai kyau gaske.
I never agreed with that.	Ban taba yarda da hakan ba.
This is exactly what happened.	A gaskiya abin da ya faru ke nan.
This, of course, is not a problem.	Wannan, ya zama, ba matsala ba ne.
He can sleep now, and he has to sleep.	Ya iya barci yanzu, kuma dole ya yi barci.
I have to take care of myself.	Dole ne in kula da kaina.
It's not much.	Ba shi da yawa.
They are always ahead.	Kullum suna kan gaba.
But we still do not know how to do this.	Amma har yanzu ba mu san yadda za mu yi wannan ba.
Can you think of a better place to be ?.	Kuna iya tunanin wuri mafi kyau ya kasance?.
The ride was easy and no problem.	Tafiya ta kasance mai sauƙi kuma ba ta da matsala.
I was tired and scared.	Na gaji ko da tsoro.

Stop myself.	Tsaya kaina.

So we did for you.	Don haka muka yi muku.
It can be easier than you think to get the attention.	Yana iya zama sauƙi fiye da yadda kuke tunani don samun hankali.

We fixed that.	Mun gyara hakan.
She didn't get that.	Ba ta samu haka ba.
If you do not have a place to go you can stay with us.	Idan ba ku da wurin zuwa za ku iya zama tare da mu.
But the teacher can't do it for you.	Amma malamin ba zai iya yi maka ba.
He did it right again.	Ya sake yi daidai.

With the exception of us, the place became deserted.	Ban da mu, wurin ya zama babu kowa.

How things have changed!	Yadda abubuwa suka canza!
To do so after he is.	Don yin haka bayan ya kasance.
Maybe he too died.	Wataƙila shi ma ya mutu.
Something else is working.	Wani abu kuma yana aiki.
Almost all of them were killed.	An kashe kusan duka.
Some users are very active.	Wasu masu amfani suna aiki sosai.
We did it once and that was enough.	Mun yi sau ɗaya kuma hakan ya isa.

No injuries were reported.	Ba a samu wani rauni ba.

Maybe they will catch us, maybe not.	Wataƙila za su kama mu, watakila a'a.
He is a successful man.	Mutum ne mai nasara.
Then we got one of the first.	Sai muka samu daya daga cikin na farko.
That may work.	Hakan na iya yin aiki.
The thought never happened to me.	Tunanin bai taba faruwa gare ni ba.
However you will.	Duk da haka za ku.
There can be no doubt at this point.	Ba za a iya shakka a wannan lokaci ba.

And another after that.	Da kuma wani bayan haka.
I talk to her almost every day.	Ina yi mata magana kusan kowace rana.

This statement is incorrect.	Wannan magana ba daidai ba ce.

And you are right.	Kuma kun yi daidai.

You are not right.	Ba ku da gaskiya.

However, that ball should have gone by then.	Duk da haka, ya kamata wannan ƙwallon ya tafi a lokacin.

Any thoughts come to you today though.	Wani tunani ya zo muku a yau ko.
She seemed to get up.	Ta yi kamar ta tashi.
Of course we know that now.	Tabbas mun san hakan a yanzu.
And leave things that way for a while.	Kuma ku bar abubuwa daidai haka na ɗan lokaci.
Interesting to hear other people's thoughts.	Abin sha'awa don jin tunanin sauran mutane.
We used to be surprised.	Mun yi amfani da mamaki.
And now you.	Kuma yanzu ku.
'job'.	'aiki'.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
They came to see me.	Sun zo duba ni.
They have it.	Suna da shi.
I have to talk to you.	Dole ne in yi magana da ku.
He started walking.	Ya fara tafiya.
You are hurting.	Kuna jin rauni.
But he got up.	Amma ya tashi.
I love kids and the enjoyment of home.	Ina son yara da jin daɗin gida.
He never got it himself.	Bai taba samun shi da kansa ba.
We will never find out if something works until we test it.	Ba za mu taɓa gano ko wani abu yana aiki ba sai mun gwada shi.
But they get you.	Amma suna samun ku.
Everyone stood still.	Kowa ya tsaya a hankali.
But everything went well.	Amma komai ya tafi daidai.
This book is the only one and it does it well.	Wannan littafin shine kawai kuma yana yin shi da kyau.
So they completely lost him.	Haka suka rasa shi gaba daya.
Maybe he just runs away from himself.	Wataƙila kawai yana gudu daga kansa.
If you are weak, you should probably stop.	Idan kana da rauni, watakila ya kamata ka daina.
I decided to leave it.	Na yanke shawarar barin shi.
I don't like myself.	Ba na son kaina.
She cries again.	Kuka ta sake yi.
Nor should it.	Haka kuma bai kamata ba.
They seem to be fighting.	Da alama suna fada da juna.
At the same time again.	A wannan lokacin kuma.
Hope you enjoy it !.	Da fatan za ku ji daɗi!.
We have no water.	Ba mu sami ruwa ba.
You can too.	Kuna iya kuma.
He closed the door.	Ya rufe kofar.
I do not know how you can leave.	Ban san yadda za ku iya barin ba.
To you, and to me, to everyone here.	Zuwa gare ku, da ni, ga kowa da kowa a nan.
Did you worry about last night?	Shin kun damu da daren jiya?
I did not ask her.	Ban tambaye ta ba.
I said.	Na ce.
Almost nothing caught him.	Kusan babu abin da ya kama shi.
But we are still here, she said.	Amma duk da haka muna nan, in ji ta.
The next car is moving.	Mota na gaba tana tafiya.
Things have changed.	Abubuwa sun canza.
It will be done later.	Za a yi ta bayan haka.
Do not let them get what they want it will be easy.	Kada ka bari su yarda samun abin da suke so zai kasance da sauƙi.
But it would be good for both of us.	Amma zai yi kyau da mu biyu.
This country is an interesting place for them.	Wannan kasa wuri ne mai ban sha'awa a gare su.
Come, let us celebrate.	Ku zo mu yi bikin.
The same fear for them as it is for you.	Tsoro ɗaya ne a gare su kamar yadda yake a gare ku.
It almost seems.	Yana da kusan alama.
The work was completed in one day.	An gama aikin a rana ɗaya.
But it is an interesting thought.	Amma tunani ne mai ban sha'awa.
I highly recommend reading it.	Ina ba da shawarar karanta shi sosai.
Since we will be here how.	Tun da za mu kasance a nan ta yaya.
Go and see.	Ku je ku gani.
Don't make me go back there.	Kar ka sa na koma can.
You have seen these many times before.	Kun ga waɗannan sau da yawa a baya.
But now we have to accept this and be prepared.	Amma yanzu dole mu yarda da wannan kuma mu shirya.
So we got plenty of food to take home.	Don haka, mun sami abinci da yawa da za mu kai gida.
There was a boat before.	Akwai jirgin ruwa a da.
All of this took time.	Duk wannan ya ɗauki lokaci.
He did.	Hakan yayi.
He will go.	Zai tafi.
You are full.	Kun cika.
I can, though.	Zan iya, ko da yake.
She told him nothing.	Ba komai ta gaya masa.
So very, very accurate.	Don haka sosai, daidai sosai.
I found 'the way out of here for myself.	Na sami 'hanyar daga nan don kaina.
And it always lasts longer.	Kuma kullum sai ya dade.
And here you have them.	Kuma a nan kuna da su.
But this is not exactly what is happening here.	Amma wannan ba daidai ba ne abin da ke faruwa a nan.
I did not see the next one.	Ban ga mai zuwa ba.
He is intelligent.	Ya na da hankali.
Yet nothing came back.	Amma duk da haka babu abin da ya dawo.
I can't sleep.	Ba zan iya barci ba.
You have a beautiful child.	Kuna da kyakkyawan yaro.
But then he went back.	Amma sai ya koma baya.
She was very active.	Ta kasance mai aiki sosai.
I'm adding her.	Ina kara mata.
We went right to work.	Mun tafi daidai don aiki.
No one is laughing.	Ba wanda yake dariya.
However, it is not easy to find.	Duk da haka, ba shi da sauƙi a samu.
The players looked at each other.	'Yan wasan sun kalli juna.
Love someone, love something.	Son wani, son wani abu.
Probably not.	Wataƙila ba gaskiya ba ne.
They are the usual clothes.	Su ne rigar da aka saba.
So we will meet for coffee.	Don haka za mu hadu don kofi.
He certainly disliked it.	Lallai ya ƙi shi.
I have worked for many years on this project.	Na yi aiki shekaru da yawa a kan wannan aikin.
Like, a lot.	Kamar, da yawa.
I always hate.	A koyaushe ina ƙi.
Can't wait to try that.	Ba za a iya jira don gwada hakan ba.
I do not know anything about you.	Ban san komai game da ku ba.
When he realized he had been found, he ran away.	Da ya gane an gano shi sai ya gudu.
Be interested in something.	Yi sha'awar wani abu.
He will not return.	Ba zai dawo ba.
We can still move forward fast.	Har yanzu muna iya ci gaba da sauri.
Let us not allow this to become a way of life.	Kada mu bar wannan ta zama hanyar da za mu ci gaba da tafiya.
He was a good speaker.	Ya kasance mai iya magana.
The program is being reviewed.	Ana sake duba shirin.
You want to be happy.	Ana son zama mai daɗi.
They played together.	Sun yi wasa tare.
All you have to do is wait.	Duk abin da za ku yi shi ne jira.
You can catch me outside a lot.	Kuna iya kama ni a waje da yawa.
They may or may not be killed, but they are.	Wataƙila ko ba za su kasance a kashe ba, amma tabbas suna.
He opened and entered.	Ya bude ya shiga.
Do not make me sick.	Kar ka sa ni rashin lafiya.
This is not extra money coming to anyone.	Wannan ba ƙarin kuɗi ke zuwa ga kowa ba.
This may be safe with you.	Wannan yana iya zama lafiya tare da ku.
But it is very interesting to hear your story.	Amma yana da ban sha'awa sosai jin labarin ku.
I know it's in me too.	Na san yana cikin nawa kuma.
No, we can't bring it.	A'a, ba za mu iya kawo shi ba.
I was ready to sign something.	Na shirya don sanya hannu kan wani abu.
He laughed at her.	Yayi mata dariya.
Things like that.	Da abubuwa kamar haka.
Show the world.	Nuna duniya.
Water should not touch the metal.	Kada ruwa ya taba karfe.
Please purchase the book.	Da fatan za a sayi littafin.
No one was around.	Babu wanda ya kasance kusa da shi.
Many things illustrate this.	Abubuwa da yawa sun bayyana hakan.
No problem there.	Babu matsala a can.
I knew he was playing, but I never heard him.	Na san yana wasa, amma ban taba jin sa ba.
Somehow, so to speak.	Ko ta yaya, don haka mu ce.
It's time to dump her.	Lokacin tafiya yayi.
We forgot to eat.	Mun manta da cin abinci.
He knows me now.	Ya san ni yanzu.
Maybe they just stopped.	Watakila sun daina kawai.
I hope it will be.	Ina fatan zai kasance.
I could be wrong. 	Zan iya yin kuskure. 
And it happened.	Kuma hakan ya faru.
They do not know it exists.	Ba su san akwai shi ba.
A year ago.	Shekara daya da ta wuce.
I am very happy.	Ina farin ciki sosai.
You will be happier.	Za ku fi farin ciki sosai.
Even if one does not like what comes, it feels good.	Ko da mutum baya son abin da ya zo, yana jin dadi.
We are dead.	Mun mutu.
I don’t know why we need two of these.	Ban san dalilin da yasa muke buƙatar biyu daga cikin waɗannan ba.
He did not want to.	Ba ya so ya ba.
I will never be in the world again.	Ba zan ƙara zama a duniya ba.
We are not trying to make it bigger.	Ba mu ƙoƙarin sanya shi girma.
You need help.	Kuna buƙatar taimako.
It takes well.	Yana ɗauka da kyau.
And so it was.	Kuma haka abin ya kasance.
How sad.	Yaya bakin ciki.
That's what's happening.	Abin da ke faruwa kenan.
A car door slammed shut.	Wata k'ofar mota ta fad'a.
I am not him.	Ni ba shi ba ne.
They come right where you show them.	Suna zuwa daidai inda ka nuna su.
Sign in.	Shiga ciki.
This is the story of someone who managed to do just that.	Wannan shine labarin wani ya sami yin hakan.
This is mine but.	Wannan nawa ne amma.
Years were hard for him.	Shekaru sun yi masa wuya.
Everything works fine.	Komai yana aiki daidai.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a san ainihin wanda zai yi nasara ba.
Excited about it, of course.	Mai farin ciki game da shi, tabbas.
No time for now.	Babu lokaci don haka yanzu.
So they know about it.	Don haka sun sani game da shi.
The water came out.	Ruwan ruwa ya fita.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
He thinks of nothing but work.	Ba ya tunanin komai sai aiki.
You are safe.	Kuna lafiya.
He said to take both at the same time.	Yace a dauki biyu lokaci guda.
And now the fear has come.	Kuma yanzu tsoro ya zo.
I know what I see.	Na san abin da nake gani.
And that works.	Kuma wannan yana aiki.
The car passed.	Motar ta wuce.
It makes him who he is.	Yana sa shi wanda yake.
I could not understand what she was doing.	Na kasa gane abin da take yi.
Who lives in this house there?	Wanene ke zaune a wannan gidan a can?
This started today.	An fara wannan a yau.
And we did not.	Kuma ba mu yi ba.
But then something happened.	Amma sai wani abu ya faru.
Maybe at some point.	Wataƙila a wani lokaci.
Until we hear something bigger.	Har sai mun ji wani abu ya fi girma.
She was amazing.	Ta kasance mai ban mamaki.
He feels that, tonight, they are fine.	Yana jin cewa, a daren nan, sun kasance lafiya.
It's an interesting thing for me.	Abu ne mai ban sha'awa a gare ni.
Everyone benefits everyone.	Kowa yana amfani da kowa.
The station is coming.	Tashar tana zuwa.
Maybe at first it just felt like running.	Wataƙila da farko kawai jin ɗan gudu ne.
I did not hear it for a while.	Ban ji shi ba a ɗan lokaci.
But it is something that will die.	Amma wani abu ne da zai mutu.
It has never been seen before.	Ba a taɓa ganin irin wannan ba.
Eat me!	Ku ci ni!
Sometimes it works fine.	Wani lokaci yana aiki lafiya.
The same.	Guda guda.
You killed him, too.	Ka kashe shi, shi ma.
Go for it.	Ku tafi don shi.
Just start somewhere.	Kawai fara wani wuri.
It feels like something has risen.	Yana ji kamar wani abu ya tashi.
And they were, for a while.	Kuma sun kasance, na ɗan lokaci.
I thought it was you.	Na dauka kai ne.
What you think is the truth.	Abin da kuke tunani shine gaskiya.
She would not go out without them.	Ba za ta fita waje ba tare da su ba.
I didn't hear much.	Ban ji da yawa ba.
She is not dead.	Ba ta mutu ba.
God is not something like that.	Allah ba wani abu bane kamar wannan.
He was still.	Ya kasance har yanzu.
I'm sure you can't give anything away.	Na tabbata ba za ku iya ba da komai ba.
Not really, how.	Ba da gaske ba, ta yaya.
That would be a good thing.	Hakan zai zama abu mai kyau.
Upcoming events.	Abubuwan da ke gaba.
He never got it and will never do it.	Bai taba samun ba kuma ba zai taba yi ba.
I'm sorry.	Na yi hakuri da hakan.
Fear of working, fear of doing anything.	Tsoron yin aiki, tsoron yin komai.
They are still human.	Har yanzu mutane ne.
Or break everything around.	Ko karya duk abin da ke kusa.
I'd like to see.	Ina so in gani.
This is a fake name.	Wannan sunan karya ne.
You have two years.	Kuna da shekaru biyu.
The police want to protect us.	'Yan sanda suna so su kare mu.
I’ve never run so fast.	Ban taba yin gudu sosai ba.
Not everything you think you see, it doesn’t exist.	Ba duk abin da kuke tunanin gani ba, babu shi.
When he was tired he sat down.	Da ya gaji ya zauna.
You can stay here if you want.	Kuna iya zama a nan idan kuna so.
He got up and was going to leave.	Ya tashi zai tafi.
You’re about to run.	Kuna yi don gudu.
He was the only child in the room.	Shi kadai ne yaro a dakin.
He thought it was something.	Ya dauka wani abu ne.
We cannot accept this.	Ba za mu yarda da wannan ba.
That's what he tells her.	Hakan yake gaya mata.
But we think these are appropriate.	Amma muna tunanin cewa waɗannan sun dace.
Here's what to do.	Ga abin da za ku yi.
I saw a very amazing job.	Na ga wani aiki mai ban mamaki sosai.
The man felt a thinker.	Mutumin ya ji mai tunani.
Next time, not right.	Nan gaba, ba dama ba.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba abin mamaki bane.
This has become a problem.	Wannan ya zama matsala.
Slowly she got up and left the meeting.	Hankali ta tashi ta bar taron.
So, let's fix this.	Don haka, bari mu gyara wannan.
And let me bring it.	Kuma bari in kawo shi.
I did it three years ago.	Na yi shi shekaru uku da suka wuce.
I do not want to hurt you at all.	Ba na so in yi muku wahala duka.
It works well.	Yana da kyau aiki.
Don't worry now.	Kada mu damu yanzu.
We tried everything a little bit.	Mun gwada komai kadan.
Her thoughts surprised him.	Tunanin ta ya bashi mamaki.
He can not walk.	Ba zai iya tafiya ba.
If so, fine.	Idan haka ne, lafiya.
He has been here ever since.	Tun daga nan yake nan.
It's amazing to see close.	Yana da ban mamaki ganin kusa.
So people leave there and go out at night.	Don haka mutane suna barin can suna fita da dare.
Who did not!	Wanda bai yi ba!
And she did not do a good job.	Kuma ba ta yi wani kyakkyawan aiki ba.
Everything this looks like real.	Duk abin da wannan ya zama kamar gaske.
It is faster than flying.	Yana da sauri fiye da tashi.
This year, everything has changed.	A wannan shekara, komai ya canza.
It will come to him.	Zai zo masa.
Just stay home.	Ku tsaya a gida kawai.
Anything more than that.	Duk wani abu zai fi wannan.
But they can say something.	Amma suna iya cewa wani abu.
Not against it.	Ba gaba da shi ba.
No one has ever done that to him.	Ba wanda ya taɓa yi masa haka.
One who has heard before.	Wanda ya ji a baya.
Just hard.	Kamar wuya.
Everyone went out.	Kowa ya fita.
That's what killed the food.	Abin da ya kashe abincin ke nan.
Here are some things that are amazing to me.	Ga wasu abubuwa da suke da ban mamaki a gare ni.
I don't want to do it now.	Ba na so in yi shi yanzu.
Let it show a little.	Bari ya nuna kadan.
It is in hand	Yana nan a hannu
I can take care of them.	Zan iya kula da su.
Hope for help.	Da fatan za a sami taimako.
I will study hard.	Zan yi karatu sosai.
Take every day as it comes.	Ɗauki kowace rana kamar yadda ya zo.
He needs to work every day, night and day.	Yana buƙatar yin aiki kowace rana, dare da rana.
I do not want to do this.	Ba na son yin wannan.
In fact, you are the first.	A gaskiya, kai ne na farko.
I recommend this !!.	Ina ba da shawarar wannan!!.
It's too fast.	Yayi sauri.
He will only talk to me, right now.	Zai yi magana da ni kawai, a yanzu.
'life.	' rayuwa.
But that did not happen.	Amma hakan bai yi ba.
There is nothing in it.	Babu komai a ciki.
But this time, in this place, she was happy.	Amma a wannan lokacin, a wannan wuri, ta kasance mai dadi.
I acted as if I had to.	Na yi kamar dole.
And the man went.	Kuma mutumin ya tafi.
Never speak without thinking.	Kar ka taba yin magana ba tare da tunani ba.
But we can't kill them.	Amma ba za mu iya kashe su ba.
Now it's back to real time.	Yanzu ya dawo ainihin lokacin.
But that did not happen.	Amma hakan bai iya faruwa ba.
In the morning there is money to be made.	Da safe akwai kudi da za a yi.
But, of course, he had to go.	Amma, ba shakka, dole ne ya tafi.
Someone has to protect them.	Dole ne wani ya kare su.
They do what people want.	Suna yin abin da mutane ke so.
We do not know exactly what we are doing.	Ba mu san ainihin abin da muke yi ba.
I will be happy in the end.	Zan yi farin ciki a ƙarshe.
First you have to show him how to do it.	Da farko za ku nuna masa yadda zai yi.
The trip will be good for you.	Tafiya za ta yi muku kyau.
Remember that and always remember.	Ku tuna da hakan kuma ku tuna koyaushe.
We are right.	Mun yi gaskiya.
Unlike him.	Ba kamar shi ba.
Start by using plenty of hot water.	Fara da amfani da ruwan zafi da yawa.
And that's more than anyone else has ever done.	Kuma wannan ya fi duk abin da wani ya yi.
It can really work.	Zai iya yin aiki da gaske.
I didn’t do very well to find anything myself.	Ban yi kyau sosai a gano wani abu da kaina ba.
So do I.	Haka da ni.
I highly recommend.	Ina ba da shawarar sosai.
There is no way, no way.	Kawai babu hanya, babu hanya.
First some will shut up if something terrible happens.	Da farko wasu za su rufe idan wani abu mai ban tsoro zai faru.
For the moment.	Don lokacin.
Or get up and fight.	Ko kuma ku tashi ku yi fada.
But that will not open the door for him.	Amma hakan ba zai bude masa ba.
You are safe too.	Kai ma lafiya.
The fear will go away.	Tsoron zai tafi.
Second, do good to people.	Na biyu, yi kyau ga mutane.
And that has happened in the past.	Kuma hakan ya faru a baya.
Kind of cold.	Irin sanyi.
But it is probably not as difficult as it seems.	Amma watakila ba shi da wahala kamar yadda ake gani.
He had to laugh.	Sai da yayi dariya.
We caught this.	Mun kama wannan.
There is a boy here who looks like you.	Akwai yaro a nan mai kama da ku.
However, she could not let him go.	Duk da haka, ta kasa barin shi ya tafi.
You will work for it.	Za ku yi aiki don shi.
What are you feeling now?	Me kuke ji yanzu?
I do not like swimming.	Ba na sha'awar yin iyo.
That was a mistake.	Hakan yayi kuskure.
They never used it.	Ba su taɓa amfani da shi ba.
And you started.	Kuma kun fara.
And she may make a lot of mistakes.	Kuma tana iya yin kuskure sosai.
Watch them do it.	Kallon su yayi.
That did not work well.	Hakan bai yi kyau ba.
She could have killed him with both.	Ta iya kashe shi da duka.
Plan what’s to come.	Shirya abin da ke zuwa.
Or mine.	Ko kuma nawa.
I'm sorry we were cut off.	Na yi hakuri an yanke mu.
And we are still waiting.	Kuma har yanzu muna jira.
I didn't feel very comfortable at night.	Ban ji dadi sosai a daren ba.
I'll go there and get there.	Zan can mu je can.
I am nothing and no one.	Ni ba komai ba ne kuma ba kowa.
It's been a long time.	Na dade.
This is almost three times too much.	Wannan kusan sau uku ya yi yawa.
Know.	Sani.
That should not be the case.	Ba haka ya kamata ya kasance ba.
It explains things.	Yana bayyana abubuwa.
But they should not be.	Amma bai kamata su kasance ba.
Everyone has to go.	Dole kowa ya tafi.
I will take care of her.	Zan kula da ita.
But that will never happen again.	Amma hakan ba zai sake faruwa ba.
Some years it rains more than usual.	Wasu shekaru ana yin ruwan sama fiye da yadda aka saba.
I knew he was going to cause trouble.	Na san yana shirin kawo matsala.
They can help with two things.	Za su iya taimaka da abubuwa biyu.
You can not edit.	Ba za ku iya gyara ba.
Later.	Bayan haka.
But it is not about fish.	Amma ba kan kifi ba ne.
Hope you are doing well.	Da fatan kuna yin kyau.
He knows how to do it.	Ya san yadda ake yin haka.
Maybe I was the one who started it.	Wataƙila ni ne na fara shi.
Lunch on my own.	Abincin rana a kaina.
No one is walking anymore.	Babu wanda ke tafiya kuma.
There is no sense about it.	Babu hankali game da shi.
Now no.	Yanzu babu.
This is going to be a pretty scary development.	Wannan zai zama babban ci gaba mai ban tsoro.
That they know really, really well.	Cewa sun sani da gaske, da gaske sosai.
Have you decided where to go this year?	Shin kun yanke shawarar inda za ku je wannan shekara?
It's huge.	Yana da girma.
No, she did not stay here.	A'a, ba ta zauna a nan ba.
He is ill.	Ya rasa lafiya.
It shows tonight.	Ya nuna yau da dare.
But now it's over.	Amma yanzu an gama.
That is amazing.	Hakan yana da ban mamaki.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu wani abu da zai wuce gaskiya.
I felt like it was the way to become me again.	Na ji kamar ita ce hanyar sake zama ni.
We met on the way.	Mun hadu a hanya.
We sell them but they add a little more.	Muna sayar da su amma sun ɗan ƙara kaɗan.
He will leave everyone alone.	Zai bar kowa shi kadai.
There is something wrong with the person.	Akwai wani abu da ba daidai ba game da mutumin.
She was pregnant.	Ta kasance mai ciki.
It was over and he knew.	An gama masa kuma ya sani.
They certainly have.	Lallai suna da.
People do not think about it.	Mutane ba sa tunani a kai.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba haka bane.
I no longer believe that.	Ban ƙara yarda da hakan ba.
They are not.	Ba su ba.
The night is like.	Daren kamar .
It all happened so fast.	Duk ya faru da sauri.
We are here looking for the truth.	Muna nan muna neman gaskiya.
Good morning.	Bari ya kwana.
Who can.	Wanda zata iya.
I will do it.	Zan yi shi.
Other than that, though, it’s not hard to do.	Ban da wannan, ko da yake, ba shi da wuya a yi.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a bayyana abin da mutumin zai iya yi ba.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
At the time no one was there.	A lokacin babu kowa a wurin.
Enter the room.	Shiga dakin.
Third, we can have everything.	Na uku, za mu iya samun komai.
All materials are tested before use.	Ana gwada duk kayan kafin amfani.
Be sure of that.	Ya tabbata da wannan.
He spoke to me, man to man.	Ya yi magana da ni, mutum da mutum.
That she could not do.	Wannan ba za ta iya yi ba.
I want to be on top of that.	Ina so in kasance akan wannan.
I read that somewhere.	Na karanta cewa a wani wuri.
We stopped before he did.	Mun daina kafin ya yi.
There is no right or wrong, really.	Babu daidai ko kuskure, da gaske.
He did not know what to say.	Bai san me zai ce ba.
And the place.	Kuma wurin.
You know that they should be there for you.	Kun san cewa ya kamata su kasance a wurin ku.
And they know what life is like with it.	Kuma sun san yadda rayuwa ta kasance tare da shi.
Another is in the room.	Wani kuma yana cikin dakin.
We are here.	Muna nan.
She has nothing to go on.	Ba ta da abin da za ta ci gaba.
If you have to travel by car, be very careful.	Idan dole ne ku yi tafiya da mota, ku kula sosai.
He was injured.	Ya samu rauni.
Or think you do.	Ko tunanin kun yi.
But then nothing happened.	Amma sai ba abin da ya faru.
Some do not.	Wasu ba sa.
I'll take this.	Zan dauka wannan.
He will come to her, in the end.	Zai zo mata, a ƙarshe.
She felt the work of god in us.	Ta ji aikin allah a cikin mu.
He started walking.	Ya fara tafiya.
That will come later, he knows.	Wannan zai zo daga baya, ya sani.
Fear of what might have been.	Tsoron abin da watakila ya kasance.
And he did not.	Kuma bai yi ba.
If you are late, you are late.	Idan kun makara, kun makara.
Some girls join before marriage.	Wasu 'yan mata sun shiga kafin aure.
Work stopped immediately.	Nan da nan aka daina aiki.
So the third.	Haka na uku.
There is almost nothing to do.	Kusan babu abin da za a yi.
I tried not to pay attention to it.	Na yi ƙoƙari ban kula shi ba.
It is not the first time, and it will not be the last.	Ba shi ne karo na farko ba, kuma ba zai zama na ƙarshe ba.
It will not do.	Ba zai yi ba.
We are not children anymore.	Mu ba yara ba ne kuma.
Life has been good for a while.	Rayuwa ta yi kyau na ɗan lokaci.
I'd like my dress	Ina son riga na
I have read this three times.	Na karanta wannan sau uku.
He wondered if it would even protect them.	Ya yi tunanin ko ma hakan zai kare su.
It happened as if on a simple mission.	Ya faru ne kamar a kan wani aiki mai sauƙi.
No one is here.	Babu kowa a nan.
Only time will tell.	Lokaci ne kawai zai nuna.
It has completely changed the way we work together.	Ya canza gaba ɗaya yadda muke aiki tare.
Sorry you are not feeling well.	Yi hakuri ba ka da lafiya.
So that we can always look inside.	Ta yadda za mu kasance kullum duba cikin.
I doubt about you.	Na yi shakka game da ku.
I love him and he hates it.	Ina son shi kuma ya ƙi shi.
No, and not tonight, he thought.	A'a, ba kuma a daren nan ba, ya yi tunani.
He was there to protect others.	Ya kasance don kare wasu.
Lies are still not accepted.	Har yanzu ba a yarda da karya ba.
You can come.	Kuna iya zuwa.
This may be the first time.	Wannan na iya zama na farko.
We need to use less water.	Muna buƙatar amfani da ruwa kaɗan.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
She can accept that.	Ta iya yarda da hakan.
This is my favorite time of the year.	Wannan shine lokacin da na fi so na shekara.
I will go.	Zan tafi.
We may not even be in time anymore.	Wataƙila ba ma zama cikin lokaci ba kuma.
I gave it a head up.	Na ba shi kai sama.
Others are skeptical.	Sauran suka yi shakka.
She loves you.	Tana son ku.
Everyone who enters the house is there.	Duk wanda ya shiga cikin gidan yana nan a can.
Take time with him.	Ɗauki lokaci tare da shi.
The rest of the world is suffering.	Sauran duniya suna shan wahala.
How, however, is still uncertain.	Ta yaya, duk da haka, har yanzu ba ta da tabbas.
But before that, nothing.	Amma kafin wannan, babu komai.
The last time was almost a week ago.	Lokaci na ƙarshe shine kusan mako guda da ya wuce.
We will never come.	Ba za mu taɓa zuwa ba.
I have something to tell you.	Ina da wani abu da zan gaya muku.
Not here in the morning.	Ba a nan da safe.
Access to both from the seat.	Ana iya samun dama ga duka daga wurin zama.
Let's go and ask her.	Mu je ka tambaye ta.
I will understand that.	Zan gane hakan.
They will eat it tomorrow.	Za su ci shi gobe.
She arrived home late at night.	Har ta isa gida dare yayi.
No one did anything.	Babu wanda ya yi komai.
But he succeeded.	Amma ya samu nasara.
I don't care.	Ban damu da shi ba.
Maybe someone has.	Wataƙila wani yana da.
In fact, there is nothing in it.	A gaskiya, babu komai a ciki.
They have to work.	Dole ne su yi aiki.
I have nothing to see.	Ba ni da wani abin da za ku gani.
She realized she was lost.	Ta gane ta bata.
She would never walk with him again.	Ba za ta ƙara tafiya da shi ba.
It doesn't matter, really.	Ba komai, da gaske.
I need to stop somewhere for coffee.	Ina bukata in tsaya wani wuri don kofi.
I was very outside.	Na yi waje sosai.
She immediately burst into tears.	Nan take ta fad'a.
Remove from heat.	Cire daga zafi.
All this will be familiar.	Duk wannan zai zama saba.
The food was delicious and tasty.	Abincin yana da dadi kuma mai dadi.
But even that is not enough.	Amma ko da hakan bai isa ba.
Productivity.	Yawan aiki.
And, we are happy.	Kuma, muna jin daɗi.
Have you met her yet?	Kun hadu da ita har yanzu?
You have to wait some time.	Dole ne ku jira wani lokaci.
He would never agree!	Ba zai taba yarda ba!
They take care of me.	Suna kula da ni.
She is always happy.	Kullum tana cikin farin ciki.
No one but me.	Ba kowa sai ni.
He will not hurry to go.	Ba zai yi sauri ya tafi ba.
They belong to someone else.	Su na wani ne.
Use this to find out what you should feel.	Yi amfani da wannan don gano abin da ya kamata ku ji.
It has nothing to do with that.	Ba shi da abin cewa.
It was a cold winter.	An yi lokacin sanyi mai wahala.
It looks good on me.	Yayi min kyau.
You have been given an amazing opportunity.	An ba ku dama ta ban mamaki.
It's just coming.	Yana zuwa kawai.
There is something else here.	Akwai wani abu kuma a nan.
But get this.	Amma samun wannan.
Wanted, but I do not know exactly how that will be.	Ana so, amma ban san ainihin yadda hakan zai kasance ba.
They will use you.	Za su yi amfani da ku.
It does not live.	Bata rayuwa.
I've never felt better.	Ban taba jin dadi ba.
I'm glad to know you well.	Na ji daɗin sanin ku da kyau.

One thing is for sure.	Abu daya tabbata.
Even the project has nothing to say.	Ko da aikin ba shi da komai da za a ce.
This man went inside.	Wannan mutumin ya shiga ciki.
I can see that happening.	Ina iya ganin hakan yana faruwa.
Not one.	Ba ko daya ba.
But nothing new.	Amma babu wani sabon abu.
So we became real.	Haka muka zama na gaske.
Like swimming in a kind of water.	Kamar suna iyo a cikin wani irin ruwa.
It is difficult to know where to look.	Yana da wuya a san inda za a duba.

Kids always do the same thing.	Yara suna yin irin wannan abu koyaushe.
And for many it will be a pleasure.	Kuma ga mutane da yawa zai zama jin daɗi.
The project should take care of that.	Aikin ya kamata ya kula da hakan.
But he really died.	Amma ya mutu da gaske.
I am a smart person.	Ni mutum ne mai hankali.
They are.	Su ne.
They are not just there.	Ba su can kawai.
I understand that completely.	Na fahimci hakan gaba daya.
She came last.	Ta zo ta ƙarshe.
And you didn’t do it.	Kuma ba ku yi shi ba.
Let it cool.	Bar shi yayi sanyi.
‘The police are looking for this man.	‘Yan sanda na neman wannan mutumin.
Yet it turns out you did not.	Amma duk da haka ya bayyana ba ku yi haka ba.
You will be alone, outside.	Za ku zama kaɗai, a waje.
It was a big mistake.	Babban kuskure ne.
She is beautiful, but also cool.	Tana da kyau, amma kuma sanyi.
I don't want you to die like the rest.	Ba na so ku mutu kamar sauran.
Life is not about heat.	Rayuwa ba game da zafi ba ce.
It's another kind of fear.	Wani irin tsoro ne kuma.
Let's talk about both.	Bari mu yi magana game da duka.
It should not happen here.	Bai kamata ya faru a nan ba.
They lived together.	Sun zauna tare.
I feel good about that.	Na ji dadi game da hakan.
It costs a lot of money and nothing to do.	Yana da kudi da yawa babu abin yi.
I tried to think of it.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin tunani da ita.
So you have it.	Don haka kuna da shi.
We went out.	Mun fita.
But they are gone now.	Amma sun tafi yanzu.
They expected more than that.	Sun yi tsammanin fiye da haka.
We do not know where we are going.	Ba mu san inda za mu ba.
And they will appear.	Kuma za su bayyana.
I want to find out more.	Ina so mu sami ƙarin.
Who lives at home?	Wa ke zaune a gida?
Many people.	Mutane da yawa.
No need is met here.	Babu wata bukata da aka cika a nan.
They do not like that.	Ba su son hakan.
Some are famous.	Wasu sun yi suna.
Everyone dies one day.	Kowa ya mutu wata rana.
Although they do.	Ko da yake suna yi.
He may be as close as ever.	Yana iya zama kusa kamar yadda ya taɓa samu.
We are still fighting.	Har yanzu muna fada.
What you think becomes yours.	Abin da kuke tunani ya zama ku.
You expect a lot.	Kuna tsammanin da yawa.
But we have to keep them here.	Amma dole mu ajiye su a nan.
He is even interested.	Har ma yana sha'awar.
But we need to learn why we think so.	Amma muna bukatar mu koyi abin da ya sa muke tunani haka.
This may have something to do with it.	Wannan yana iya samun wani abu da shi.
That’s just a thought, though.	Wannan kawai tunani ne, ko da yake.
What does he see now?	Me yake gani, yanzu?
It can be both.	Zai iya zama duka.
Maybe he does.	Wataƙila yana yi.
I kept myself down.	Na ajiye kaina kasa.
I do not want to.	Ban so ba.
It seems you still have to pay.	Da alama har yanzu dole ne ku biya.
And she has it.	Kuma tana da shi.
But try and be cool about it.	Amma gwada kuma ku yi sanyi game da shi.
Well it should.	Da kyau ya kamata .
But in fact that night was one year.	Amma a gaskiya wannan dare ya kasance shekara guda.
Maybe they will die trying.	Wataƙila za su mutu a ƙoƙarin.
They will want something from me first.	Za su so wani abu daga gare ni da farko.
We'll talk more.	Za mu kara magana.
No one told me that.	Babu wanda ya gaya mani haka.
It should not be hard to find.	Bai kamata ya yi wuya a samu ba.
The car will not start.	Mota ba za ta fara ba.
It is not very difficult.	Ba shi da wahala sosai.
You wear whatever you want.	Kuna sa duk abin da kuke so.
But there is something else.	Amma akwai wani abu kuma.
It will not do well.	Ba zai yi kyau ba.
That's right.	Daidai ne.
I will be sick.	Zan yi rashin lafiya.
She did not do the same.	Ita ma ba ta yi kamar ɗaya ba.
We were close to the bottom.	Mu kasance kusa da kasa.
That's how it started.	Haka aka fara.
You bother me.	Kun damu ni.
We do not have much time.	Ba mu da lokaci mai yawa.
Whatever you want, we pay you for any interest you may have.	Komai abin da kuke so, mun biya ku ga kowane sha'awar ku.
Finally, answer.	A ƙarshe, amsa.
It's one o'clock in the morning.	Bayan daya na safe ne.
We can leave.	Za mu iya barin.
She had to play the game.	Dole ta buga wasan.
And the amazing thing is, we have never had one.	Kuma abin ban mamaki shi ne, ba mu taɓa samun ko ɗaya ba.
I hope you succeed.	Ina fatan za ku yi nasara.
I understand how you feel.	Na fahimci yadda kuke ji.
You will feel at home from the moment you enter.	Za ku ji a gida daga lokacin da kuka shiga ciki.
I thought a lot about that.	Na yi tunani sosai game da hakan.
Food for thought.	Abinci don tunani.
You did nothing to me.	Baka yi min komai ba.
And maybe there's more.	Kuma watakila akwai ƙarin.
Drink water for one day.	A sha ruwan a rana daya.
They also did not work.	Su ma ba su yi aiki ba.
Not at this happy time.	Ba a wannan lokacin farin ciki ba.
Seriously selfish.	Da gaske son kai.
I can't be caught in a job.	Ba za a iya kama ni a cikin wani aiki ba.
As it should.	Kamar yadda ya kamata.
Seats are full.	Wurin zama ya cika.
I should check.	Ya kamata in duba.
It can kill a lot of dogs.	Yana iya kashe kare mai yawa.
And they returned.	Kuma suka dawo.
You will not recognize him.	Ba za ku gane shi ba.
Please don't make me laugh.	Don Allah kar a bani dariya.
The goods were purchased.	An sayi kayan.
Which is sad.	Wanda abin bakin ciki ne.
We would like your help in this regard.	Za mu so taimakon ku akan hakan.
Make a quick response within yourself.	Ka fito da amsa cikin sauri a cikin ka.
Time will change for all of that.	Lokaci zai canza duk wannan.
He closed the door and sat down.	Ya rufe kofar ya zauna.
He will get out of the car.	Zai fito daga motar.
Very, very difficult to see.	Sosai, da wuya a gani.
It seems to have happened in a short time.	Da alama ya faru cikin ɗan lokaci.
It’s more fun, honestly.	Ya fi jin daɗi, gaskiya.
It's really nice to have it here.	Yana da kyau sosai samun shi a nan.
I have to go back to being myself.	Dole ne in koma zama ni.
Do you frequent air travel?	Kuna yawan tafiya da jirgin sama?
It is very difficult.	Yana da matukar wahala.
But we do not have any such equipment.	Amma ba mu da wani kayan aiki irin wannan.
Now I begin to remember him.	Yanzu na fara tuna shi.
He wants me to go out with him.	Yana so in fita da shi.
Like she hated me.	Kamar ta ƙi ni.
I always like to swim.	A koyaushe ina son yin iyo.
You can be a child.	Za ka iya zama yaro.
But in the end, there is always growth.	Amma a ƙarshe, akwai ko da yaushe girma.
I can't keep doing this.	Ba zan iya ci gaba da yin wannan ba.
Many are right.	Da yawa suna da gaskiya.
Apparently they did not develop much.	Da alama ba su ci gaba da yawa ba.
But you take care of me.	Amma kuna kula da ni.
Start the car.	Fara motar.
Maybe because he is not as good as the others.	Wataƙila saboda ba shi da kyau kamar sauran su.
It's coming.	Yana zuwa.
Or, how, it felt like one.	Ko, ta yaya, ya ji kamar ɗaya.
It should be close.	Ya kamata ya kasance kusa.
It certainly helps with pain.	Tabbas ya taimaka da zafi.
He reached out to her.	Ya kai mata hannu.
This is a fake method.	Wannan hanyar karya ce.
She hopes the event will be interesting.	Ta yi fatan taron zai kasance mai ban sha'awa.
But, of course, something amazing happened.	Amma babu shakka wani abu mai ban mamaki ya faru.
We don’t think about it.	Ba mu tunani game da shi.
We'll talk a little bit.	Za mu yi magana da ɗan gaba ɗaya.
Do not put them in doubt.	Kar ka sanya su cikin shakka .
It does not come from heaven.	Ba ya zuwa daga sama.
We went to the restaurant.	Muka je gidan abincin dare.
But it will not happen here.	Amma ba zai faru a nan ba.
I just want to make sure nothing happens.	Ina so ne kawai in tabbatar babu abin da ya faru.
Nothing to worry about.	Babu abin da za ku damu.
There you have it.	Can kuna da shi.
That name came out.	Wannan suna ya fito.
What is wrong is ignorance.	Abin da ba shi da kyau shi ne sani.
Tell him to hurry back.	Ka ce masa ya yi sauri ya koma.
People, food and drink went all the way.	Mutane, abinci da abin sha sun tafi ta kowace hanya.
I knew he was coming, and he did.	Na san yana zuwa, kuma ya yi.
Others are with him.	Wasu kuma suna tare da shi.
Talk to her.	Magana da ita.
Deal.	Da yawa.
When it rained, the dog ran inside.	Lokacin da aka yi ruwan sama, kare yana gudu a ciki.
I did not leave it that way.	Ban bar shi haka ba.
There is nothing better to do.	Babu wani abu da ya fi kyau a yi.
But she can think slowly.	Amma ta iya yin tunani a hankali.
Couldn't find the right one.	Ba a iya samun wanda ya dace ba.
This is the real reason why we need to get this right.	Wannan shine ainihin dalilin da ya sa muke buƙatar samun wannan daidai.
Hit myself on something.	Buga kaina akan wani abu.
He gave us this opportunity.	Ya ba mu wannan dama.
It was time for dinner.	Ya dawo lokacin cin abinci.
Even when we are good, we cannot really trust him.	Ko da a lokacin da muke da kyau, ba za mu iya yarda da shi sosai ba.
But now he has what he can do.	Amma yanzu ya sami abin da zai iya yi.
However, it is a matter of time.	Duk da haka, wani abu ne na lokaci.
The work is amazing.	Aikin yana da ban mamaki.
There they released them.	Nan suka sake su.
That's a good statement.	Magana ce mai kyau.
It gives me so back.	Yana ba ni haka baya.
We have to go there.	Dole mu je can.
And so they do.	Kuma haka suke yi.
We will go alone.	Za mu tafi ni kaɗai.
She called me and told me to go.	Ta kira ni ta ce in tafi.
I do not know what she will do.	Ban san me za ta yi ba.
I think that's what they call it.	Ina tsammanin abin da suke kira shi ke nan.
Remove all skin oil.	A cire duk mai da fata.
It’s not you, and it’s not you.	Ba ku ba ne, kuma ba ku ba ne.
We will go ahead with you.	Za mu yi gaba da ku.
Let's see what can be done.	Bari mu ga abin da za a iya yi duk da haka.
And we will do one week at a time.	Kuma za mu yi mako guda a kowane.
And catch him.	Kuma kama shi.
Get a little car like that.	Samun mota kaɗan haka.
Not as you think, he said.	Ba kamar yadda kuke tunani ba, in ji shi.
But often they do not have anything to say.	Amma sau da yawa ba su da abin da za su ce.
You have so much to offer us.	Kuna da abubuwa da yawa da za ku ba mu.
He too.	Shi kuma.
We are intelligent people.	Mu mutane ne masu hankali.
He is a boy who can suffer terribly.	Yaro ne wanda zai iya shan wahala sosai.
Who knows what might be.	Wanene ya san abin da zai iya zama.
This is not the case.	Wannan ba haka yake ba.
I refuse that it must be true.	Na ƙi cewa tabbas gaskiya ne.
But if it's not yours, that's fine too.	Amma idan ba na ku ba, hakan ma yayi kyau.
Talk to someone.	Yi magana da mutum.
I do not understand why it will not work.	Ban gane dalilin da ya sa ba zai yi aiki ba.

I hope you do too.	Ina fatan ku ma ku yi.
It is easy to understand what happened.	Yana da sauƙi a gane abin da ya faru.
If you do not remember anything I do.	Idan baka tuna komai ba nawa.
The most amazing thing happened yesterday.	Abu mafi ban mamaki ya faru jiya.
Tobacco.	Taba.
It is not good on the run.	Ba shi da kyau a kan gudu.
Time is not right.	Lokaci bai yi daidai ba.
That is not easy.	Hakan ba shi da sauƙi sosai.
He hoped for many things.	Ya yi fatan abubuwa da yawa.
When they returned, they beat her.	Sai da suka dawo, suna buga mata.
No one will ever see them.	Ba wanda zai taɓa ganin su.
It gives me a lot of everything and everything.	Tana ba ni da yawa daga komai da komai.
Get in the car.	Shiga cikin mota.
I want to run	Ina son gudu
Success is sweet.	Nasara tana da daɗi.
I do not know what is going on.	Ban san me ke faruwa ba.
In fact she wanted to know.	A gaskiya ta so ta sani.
Do something fun that you enjoy.	Yi wani abu mai daɗi da kuke jin daɗi.
We are not killing you.	Ba muna kashe ku ba.

I do not know the future.	Ban san gaba ba.
But of course we have a bow for it.	Amma tabbas muna da baka a gare ta.
We are not children.	Mu ba yara ba ne.
They started eating really well.	Sun fara cin abinci sosai.
It is time for her to die.	Lokaci yayi da zata mutu.
I will talk to you inside.	Zan yi muku magana ta ciki.
He could not remember the name of the dog.	Ya kasa tuna sunan kare.
But no one grew up.	Amma ba wanda ya girma.
You have to talk to him.	Dole ne ku yi magana da shi.
It has been in use for almost a month.	Kusan wata guda ana amfani da shi.
And next.	Kuma na gaba.
See you tonight.	Gani yau daren.
You should say, though, if it is wrong.	Ya kamata ku ce, ko da yake, idan ba daidai ba ne.
They did not encounter any problems for a while.	Ba su ci karo da wata matsala ba na ɗan lokaci.
She will not be tired.	Ba za ta gaji ba.
And they should be very scared.	Kuma ya kamata su kasance da tsoro sosai.
Maybe he is sleeping now.	Wataƙila yana barci yanzu.
We didn't say anything.	Ba mu ce komai ba.
They were arrested by the police.	'Yan sanda sun kama su.
I hope it helps.	Ina fatan zai taimaka.
We kept playing.	Muka ci gaba da wasa.
Let's do this.	Bari mu yi wannan.
But it is.	Amma haka abin yake.
They will help us.	Za su taimake mu.
Not himself.	Ba shi kansa ba.
This is done now.	Wannan ya yi yanzu.
They met one day, at a restaurant.	Sun hadu wata rana, a wani gidan abinci.
I also remember you.	Ni ma na tuna ku.
We really want to hear from you.	Muna matukar son jin ta bakin ku.
I am looking for a home.	Ina neman siyan gida.
That was many years ago.	Hakan ya kasance shekaru da yawa da suka gabata.
It will leave people cold.	Zai bar mutane sanyi.
But then he caught himself.	Amma sai ya kama kansa.
He entered the house.	Ya shiga gidan.
I tried a little.	Na gwada kadan.
But you still have to sleep sometimes.	Amma har yanzu dole ka yi barci wani lokaci.
I don't know how it works.	Ban san yadda yake aiki ba.
She knew he recognized her.	Ta san ya gane ta.
And funny to ask that.	Kuma ban dariya ka tambayi cewa.
They have nothing.	Ba su da komai.
And your thoughts are our favorite among you.	Kuma tunanin ku shine abin da muka fi so a cikin ku.
You will come through this.	Za ku zo ta wannan.
But there will be consequences.	Amma za a sami abubuwan da suka fito.
And if you missed them, you can still watch them here.	Kuma idan kun rasa su, kuna iya har yanzu kallon su a nan.
You can get that much easier.	Kuna iya samun hakan da yawa da sauƙi.
She often does not like to play.	Sau da yawa ba ta son wasa.
Children do not hear.	Yara ba sa ji.
But they did not.	Amma ba su yi ba.
I let you sit.	Na bar ku ku zauna.
But tonight, we had another fight.	Amma a daren yau, mun yi wani fada.
She wants it here.	Ta so shi a nan.
Hurry up before the rain comes.	Sai a yi sauri kafin ruwan sama ya zo.
We went to the party, it was a pleasure.	Mun je wurin bikin, abin farin ciki ne.
She is still wearing it.	Har yanzu tana sanye.
Everything we need.	Duk abin da muke bukata.
It's not uncommon when that happens at work.	Ba dadi lokacin da hakan ya faru a wurin aiki.
She would not tell anyone.	Ba za ta gaya wa kowa ba.
The train will be there.	Motar jirgin kasa zai kasance a wurin.
I could not bring myself to leave it behind.	Ba zan iya kawo kaina in bar shi a baya ba.
I think we will die.	Ina tsammanin za mu mutu.
I think you want to get home soon.	Ina tsammanin kuna so ku dawo gida nan da nan.
The car is on the road.	Mota na kan hanya.
We are not such a place.	Mu ba irin wannan wuri ba ne.
I do not know you child.	Ban san ku ba yaro.
People talk about him, but he stops talking.	Mutane suna magana game da shi, amma ya daina magana.
It cannot be changed.	Ba za a iya canza shi ba.
They are tired.	Sun gaji.
They have already suffered a lot.	Sun riga sun sha wahala mai yawa.
Sometimes it is good.	Wani lokaci yana da kyau.
Not a good boat.	Ba kyakkyawan jirgin ruwa ba.
But he did not return.	Amma bai dawo ba.
You have to be scary to lose it.	Dole ne ku zama mai ban tsoro don rasa shi.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
I don't like the truth.	Ba na son gaskiya.
He can do a little now.	Zai iya yin kaɗan yanzu.
He knows these things.	Ya san waɗannan abubuwa.
You and I.	Mu, kai da ni.
Anyone can point to a problem.	Kowa na iya nuna matsala.
Carry on.	Ci gaba.
What could go wrong?	Me zai iya faruwa ba daidai ba?.
I lost one knee.	Na rasa gwiwa daya.
Who knows you have so much.	Wanene ya san kuna da yawa.
Good lunch.	An yi abincin rana mai kyau.
The road is not full of anyone, however.	Hanyar ba ta cika kowa ba, duk da haka.
He appeared to be amazed at what he was saying like everyone else.	Ya bayyana cewa yana mamakin abin da yake fada kamar kowa.
They would have done what they wanted.	Da sun yi abin da suke so.
Not this.	Ba wannan ba.
Let the big man sit a little.	Bari babban mutum ya zauna kadan.
And the water is rising.	Kuma ruwan yana tashi.
They played and played.	Suka buga da wasa.
There is nothing strange about it.	Babu wani abu mai ban mamaki a ciki.
That could be.	Hakan na iya zama.
You do not have to do anything.	Ba lallai ne ku yi komai ba.
Some with missed opportunities.	Wasu tare da rasa damar.
God does not care.	Allah bai damu da hakan ba.
Try to walk slowly.	Yi ƙoƙarin tafiya a hankali.
We went to the meeting, and we lost.	Mun je taron, sai muka yi rashin nasara.
Now it will never.	Yanzu ba zai taba.
It's amazing, you know, sitting here.	Yana da ban mamaki, ka sani, zaune a nan.
I have to go back, he thought.	Dole ne in koma, ya yi tunani.
I am here and you are there.	Ina nan kuma kuna can.
I got that.	Na samu haka.
How to talk to him.	Yadda za a yi magana da shi.
I use it because it works great.	Ina amfani da shi saboda yana aiki mai girma.
That does not seem to be the case.	Da alama hakan ba haka yake ba.
The absence of anything could not explain that.	Rashin wani abu ba zai iya bayyana hakan ba.
Do not forget where you came from.	Kar a manta daga inda kuka fito.
It helps a lot of people.	Yana taimakon mutane da yawa.
One day she ran away from school for two days.	Wata rana ta gudu daga makaranta kwana biyu.
She did not know how it was.	Ba ta san yadda abin ya kasance ba.
Twice as many times.	Sau biyu da yawa.
Do not kill.	Kada ku kashe.
I heard it.	Na ji shi.
I read it.	Na karanta shi.
We kept talking.	Muka ci gaba da magana.
Certainly not me.	Tabbas ba ni ba.
This game is close to calling.	Wannan wasan ya yi kusa da kira.
She would never trust me.	Ba za ta taba yarda da ni ba.
Let me ask you something.	Bari in tambaye ka wani abu.
I think he will be back by now.	Ina tsammanin zai dawo nan zuwa yanzu.
It has to be that way.	Dole ya kasance haka.
He left the door closed.	Ya bar kofar ya rufe.
He always carries it.	Yana ɗauka da shi kullum.
This is not the best, however.	Wannan bai fi kyau ba, duk da haka.
I felt like it had to be done.	Na ji kamar dole ne a yi.
Everything was as it had been.	Komai ya kasance kamar yadda ya bar shi.
Do not touch it and it will not hurt.	Kar ku taba shi kuma ba zai yi zafi ba.
We have no place to go.	Ba mu da wurin zuwa.
He studied a lot.	Ya yi karatu da yawa.
The clock is ticking.	Karfe ya tashi sama.
It's an amazing thing.	Abu ne mai ban mamaki.
She stepped back.	Ta koma baya.
I saved that.	Na ajiye hakan.
You can leave tomorrow.	Kuna iya fita daga nan gobe.
He also loves to travel.	Yana kuma son tafiya.
But there is more discomfort.	Amma akwai ƙarin rashin jin daɗi.
You can not sleep on this.	Ba za ku iya yin barci akan wannan ba.
It must have been.	Lallai ta kasance.
It is not something that comes to some people.	Ba wani abu ba ne da ke zuwa ga wasu mutane.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
But she can wait.	Amma ta iya jira.
Some people may like it, others may not.	Wasu mutane na iya son shi, wasu ba za su iya ba.
The same is true now.	Haka abin yake a yanzu.
What they do is more fun.	Abin da suke yi ya fi jin daɗi.
It goes well, more than he hopes.	Yana tafiya da kyau, fiye da yadda yake fata.
We are ready for it.	Mun shirya don shi.
Here you go.	Nan ka tafi.
We will wait and see.	Za mu jira mu gani.
You must help me.	Dole ne ku taimake ni.
They are three.	Su uku ne.
This material cannot be made.	Ba za a iya yin wannan kayan ba.
She wanted me not to.	Ta so ni ba shi ba.
I understand it now.	Na gane shi yanzu.
You did a great job with them too.	Kun yi kyakkyawan aiki tare da su kuma.
See where it takes you.	Duba inda ya kai ku.
The big surprise was that it hadn’t happened in the past.	Babban abin mamaki shi ne cewa bai faru ba a baya.
Do you drink a lot of water?	Kuna shan ruwa da yawa?
It will not make him lose control of the game now.	Ba zai yi masa ya rasa kula da wasan ba a yanzu.
It tells you how to get or do these things.	Ta gaya muku yadda ake samun ko yin waɗannan abubuwan.
Allow older children to play outside.	Bar yara masu girma suna wasa a waje.
It does not have to be you or me.	Ba lallai ne ya zama ku ko ni ba.
But now everything has changed.	Amma yanzu komai ya canza.
In fact, it may be only one.	A gaskiya ma, yana iya zama ɗaya kawai.
As for her.	Amma ga ita.
But we will never come to the future.	Amma ba za mu taɓa zuwa lokacin nan gaba ba.
I can not drink.	Ba zan iya sha ba.
God knows what He wants it to be.	Allah ya san abin da ya so haka.
Just talk, you say.	Magana kawai, ka ce.
I did not look at the plane.	Ban duba jirgin ba.
Of course it is over.	Tabbas ta gama.
I can tell you it is a job.	Zan iya gaya muku wani aiki ne.
This always makes you go.	Wannan koyaushe yana sa ku tafi.
But no one was in the car.	Amma babu kowa a cikin motar.
It appears only one.	Ya bayyana daya ne kawai.
It wouldn’t look so good with anything that would go out there.	Ba za ta yi kyau sosai da duk wani abu da zai fita a can ba.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Gara jin wani abu fiye da komai.
Probably no one knows.	Wataƙila babu wanda ya sani.
He himself got into trouble again.	Shi kansa ya sake samun matsala.
I will buy from them again.	Zan sake saya daga gare su.
I'm waiting for you to bring us back.	Ina jira don in dawo da mu.
It's nothing.	Bata ce komai ba.
They wait, but no one comes out.	Suna jira, amma ba wanda ya fito.
There is so much to lose.	Akwai da yawa da za a rasa.
That's what everyone thinks.	Abin da kowa ke tunani ke nan.
They did not like it.	Ba su ji daɗin hakan ba.
I have heard it before.	Na ji shi a baya.
We had already finished lunch when the bus arrived.	Mun riga mun gama abincin rana lokacin da motar bas ta zo.
Maybe just all of them can be right, after all.	Wataƙila kawai duk suna iya zama daidai, bayan duk.
He had to stop looking for something.	Sai da ya tsaya neman wani abu.
But it’s worth a look.	Amma yana da kyau a duba.
Any joy to do.	Duk wani farin ciki da za su yi.
Ahead of me.	Gaba da ni.
Or he raised her.	Ko ya daga mata.
You will know.	Za ku sani.
No one can hear.	Ba wanda zai iya ji.
No, it's something else.	A'a, wani abu ne kuma.
We will never get them again.	Ba za mu sake samun su ba.
But they work.	Amma suna aiki.
And it is not so.	Kuma ba haka bane.
Some even came and played with me.	Wasu ma har sun zo suna wasa da ni.
Will they do well?	Za su yi kyau?
Finally, something good is happening!	A ƙarshe, wani abu mai kyau yana faruwa!
It’s so beautiful it can’t be real.	Yana da kyau sosai ba zai iya zama na gaske ba.
Turn it on, and it works.	Kunna shi, kuma yana aiki.
If she says everyone is leaving, those things will hurt.	Idan ta ce kowa ya tafi, waɗannan abubuwan za su ji rauni.
No one will ever know that you are involved.	Ba wanda zai taɓa sanin cewa kuna da hannu.
Things started to go fast.	Abubuwa sun fara tafiya da sauri.
He does nothing of this.	Ba ya yin komai daga wannan.
It looks like it, too.	Yana kama da shi, kuma.
I could not believe it.	Na kasa yarda da shi.
Really good, as the man said.	Kyawun gaskiya, kamar yadda mutumin ya ce.
But they already know it.	Amma sun riga sun san shi.
You have a feeling.	Kuna da ji.
But something went wrong.	Amma wani abu bai yi daidai ba.
I’m not sure why you don’t see that.	Ban tabbata dalilin da yasa ba ku ganin haka.
They may want to touch you, but they will not touch you.	Wataƙila suna son a taɓa ku amma ba za su taɓa ku ba.
She hopes to be.	Ta yi fatan ta kasance.
I think it's the right thing to do.	Ina ganin abu ne da ya dace a yi.
I waited until the last day to agree.	Na jira har zuwa ranar ƙarshe don in yarda.
As long as people don’t work with it.	Matukar mutane ba su yi aiki da shi ba.
For them, this is their happiest year of the year.	A gare su, wannan shine lokacin farin cikin su na shekara.
It is not necessary.	Baya bukata.
They are not lost.	Bata bata ba.
We have never been to this before.	Ba mu taba zuwa a baya ba.
But he did not hear her.	Amma bai ji ta ba.
It was a night without dinner.	Wani dare ne babu abincin dare.
They will give you everything you want.	Za su ba ku duk abin da kuke so.
Only one person in the family will do that.	Mutum daya ne kawai a gidan zai yi hakan.
I didn't hear anything he said.	Ban ji komai ya ce ba.
I would like to have one.	Ina son samun daya.
That can be a problem.	Hakan na iya zama matsala.
He never slept with anyone.	Bai taba kwana da kowa ba.
Preparing food is always a chore.	Shirya abinci koyaushe aiki ne.
They are more interesting.	Sun fi ban sha'awa.
Still, the story is good.	Duk da haka, labarin yana da kyau.
We enjoy things like that.	Muna jin daɗin abubuwa kamar haka.
You cannot change this.	Ba za ku iya canza wannan ba.
We agree that this is not the case.	Mun yarda cewa ba haka bane.
That's what you did and how you learned to talk.	Abin da kuka yi ke nan da yadda kuka koyi magana.
So nothing for this year.	Don haka babu wani abu na wannan shekara.
Let the heat rise.	Bari zafi ya tashi.
There was definitely no rain last night.	Lallai babu ruwan sama a daren jiya.
But she did not care.	Amma bata damu ba.
It is financial.	Shi ne na kudi.
He did not know what to do with the food.	Bai san me zai yi da kayan abinci ba.
It will not happen.	Ba zai faru ba.
I got up and went out.	Na tashi na fita.
But anything you can tell me can help.	Amma duk abin da za ku iya gaya mani zai iya taimaka.
The problem is it does not work.	Matsalar ita ce ba ta aiki.
It takes me a while to put the name on.	Yana ɗaukar ni ɗan lokaci don sanya sunan.
Come here.	Ku zo nan.
You can imagine how it was.	Kuna iya tunanin yadda abin ya kasance.
It was then that they fled with him.	Lokacin su ne suka gudu da shi.
I can't wait to read this book.	Ba zan iya jira in karanta wannan littafin ba.
I do not know how he did it.	Ban san yadda ya yi haka ba.
Find out what you have in common.	Gano abin da kuke da shi a kansa.
I think he did not know what to do.	Ina tsammanin bai san abin da zai yi ba.
He made a great run.	Ya yi babban gudu.
It's hard, fast and not very good.	Yana da wuya, sauri kuma ba kyau sosai ba.
It is not good, but it is also not good.	Ba shi da kyau, amma kuma ba shi da kyau.
Is this book suitable for children?	Shin wannan littafin ya dace da yara?
You have to act like everything is amazing.	Dole ne ku yi kamar komai yana da ban mamaki.
You always get up.	Kullum kuna tashi.
We got you.	Mun samu ku.
He knows what he wants.	Ya san abin da yake so.
It has never been seen before.	Ba a taɓa ganin irin sa ba.
You have never seen other people.	Ba ka taba ganin sauran mutane ba.
The game was won.	Wasan ya yi nasara.
They looked so good too.	Sun yi kyau sosai kuma.
He did not speak again.	Bai sake magana ba.
He looked at himself.	Ya kalli kansa.
There are children on board.	Akwai yara a cikin jirgin.
But now he cares about them.	Amma yanzu ya damu da su.
I do not know where it will take me.	Ban san inda zai kai ni ba.
I have a cold.	Na yi sanyi sosai.
If not, it should show nothing.	Idan ba haka ba, bai kamata ya nuna komai ba.
Maybe there are good things out there.	Wataƙila akwai abubuwa masu kyau a wurin.
We really enjoyed it.	Mun ji daɗin hakan sosai.
And they will know us.	Kuma za su san mu.
And we still surprise you too.	Kuma har yanzu muna da mamakin ku ma.
They have to find something new, always.	Dole ne su sami sabon abu, koyaushe.
Now we will.	Yanzu za mu.
We got it.	Mun samu.
The rest he saved.	Sauran ya ajiye.
Maybe that's true.	Wataƙila hakan gaskiya ne.
He committed suicide.	Ya kashe kansa.
Not finished.	Ba a gama ba.
You know that in the future.	Kun san haka a gaba.
The dog was alone at home.	Kare ya kasance shi kaɗai a gida.
They never spoke again.	Ba su sake yin magana tare ba.
I should be fine.	Ya kamata in yi lafiya.
That's just it.	Wannan kawai.
We just need more of us.	Muna buƙatar ƙarin mu kawai.
She wondered what had happened.	Ta yi mamakin me ya faru.
Anything happens.	Duk wani abu ya faru.
In fact, don’t be anyone.	A gaskiya, kada ku zama kowa.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
He could not let that happen.	Ba zai iya barin hakan ta faru ba.
They are hot on the road.	Suna zafi akan hanya.
You are not very good today.	Ba ku da kyau sosai a yau.
He read about such things.	Ya karanta game da irin waɗannan abubuwa.
I have never had such a problem before.	Ban taba samun irin wannan matsala ba a baya.
She knew, even if he didn't know.	Ita ta sani, ko da bai sani ba.
That's why you do.	Shi ya sa kuke yi.
There is not much in this.	Babu yawa a cikin wannan.
He immediately recognized me.	Nan take ya gane ni.
You will.	Za ku yi.
Tell me what happened.	Fada min me ya faru.
As for the problem.	Amma ga matsalar.
I did not answer.	Ban amsa ba.
It looks like a normal one.	Ya yi kama da saba.
And no money, by the way.	Kuma babu kudi, ta hanyar.
Surprisingly, that made it work.	Abin ban mamaki, hakan ya sa ya yi aiki.
People cut me off.	Mutane sun yanke ni.
Find out how bad you like it.	Gano yadda mummunan kuke so.
Hopefully we will continue to be successful in the future.	Da fatan za mu ci gaba da samun nasara a gaba.
He would like to know what happened to me.	Zai so ya san abin da ya faru da ni.
I spent a week there one night.	Na yi mako guda a can dare daya.
I will cut back.	Zan yanke baya.
I try really hard.	Ina ƙoƙari sosai.
They drank a lot of coffee.	Suka sha kofi da yawa.
He must have been involved for many years.	Lallai ya kasance yana da hannu tsawon shekaru.
But no.	Amma babu.
But we sold, you know.	Amma mun sayar, kun sani.
We will stop and help.	Za mu tsaya mu taimaka.
He came when he heard that.	Ya zo lokacin da ya ji haka.
He is with us in this room.	Yana nan tare da mu a wannan dakin.
In the second week.	A cikin mako na biyu.
There was little she could do.	Akwai kadan da ta iya.
I did not do well.	Ban yi min kyau ba.
He wanted to return home.	Ya so ya koma gidan.
The story is afraid you won’t let it go.	Labarin yana tsoron kada ku bar shi ya tafi.
I like it right away.	Ina son shi nan da nan.
I know her well.	Na san ta sosai.
They usually eat together.	An saba cin abinci tare.
The sky needs fixing.	Sama tana bukatar gyara.
They are not here anymore.	Ba su nan kuma.
You can try wearing your dress.	Kuna iya gwada sa rigar ku.
It is a very difficult thing to do.	Abu ne mai matukar wahala a yi.
You really know them.	Da gaske kuna san su.
We know how it is.	Mun san yadda hakan yake.
Don't worry, everything is fine.	Kar ku damu, komai yayi kyau.
This requires work.	Wannan yana buƙatar aiki.
That you will do whatever is right for you.	Cewa za ku yi duk abin da ya dace a gare ku.
You will do well.	Za ku yi kyau.
I want to do my best.	Ina so in yi mafi kyau.
Immediately.	Nan take.
I will write down what you need.	Zan rubuta abin da kuke bukata.
But remember that you do.	Amma ku tuna cewa kuna yi.
She added one.	Ta kara daya.
We didn't even look at each other.	Ba mu ma kalli juna ba.
Maybe we never did.	Wataƙila ba mu taɓa yi ba.
She knew it was a surprise.	Ta san abin mamaki ne.
He loves school.	Yana son makaranta.
It's just metal.	Karfe ne kawai.
He has not yet confirmed it.	Har yanzu bai tabbatar da ita ba.
Go home.	Ka tafi gida.
I'm very worried.	Na damu da yawa.
The water is sweet.	Ruwan yayi dadi.
This can be done again.	Ana iya sake yin hakan.
They should pay close attention to what they say.	Su kula sosai da abin da suke fada.
Bring me back to life.	Ka dawo da ni rayuwa.
Let illness help you not to be afraid.	Bari rashin lafiya ya taimake ku ba da tsoro.
It is a hot day.	Rana mai zafi.
I can't believe this.	Ba zan iya yarda da wannan ba.
You are so beautiful.	Kuna da kyau sosai.
I don't know what kind of place yet, anywhere.	Ban san wane irin ba tukuna, ko a ina.
He stayed there for a few years.	Ya zauna a wurin na wasu shekaru.
No, it is not.	A'a, ba haka ba ne.
You should do this when you can.	Ya kamata ku yi hakan lokacin da za ku iya.
Maybe he doesn't really want to know.	Wataƙila ba ya son sanin gaske.
But a good idea.	Amma tunani mai kyau.
We got each other.	Mun samu juna.
He should not have started this journey.	Bai kamata ya fara wannan tafiya ba.
After the water was removed everyone came out of the ground.	Bayan an cire ruwa kowa ya fito daga kasa.
He did not feel he had signed correctly.	Bai ji ba ya sa hannu daidai.
What we found was amazing.	Abin da muka samu ya ban mamaki.
There was no way she could get into a fight.	Babu yadda za ta yi ta shiga wani fada.
The two of us will walk together happily.	Mu biyu za mu yi tafiya tare da farin ciki.
Finally, he left.	A ƙarshe, ya tafi.
I just joined.	Na shiga kawai.
I think you will love it there.	Ina tsammanin za ku so shi a can.
We would have done better.	Da mun yi kyau.
I will be at the opening weekend for this.	Zan kasance a wurin bude karshen mako don wannan.
So, somehow, you are right.	Don haka, ta wata hanya, kuna da gaskiya.
This is not the place to do it.	Wannan ba wurin yin hakan bane.
He just wants to work.	Yana son yin aiki kawai.
Of course he is tired.	Tabbas ya gaji.
So there are a lot of things.	Don haka akwai abubuwa da yawa.
Maybe it's good to talk.	Wataƙila yana da kyau a yi magana.
There is no reason to be surprised.	Bata da dalilin mamaki.
I do this at home.	Ina yin haka a gida.
I can't work.	Ba zan iya aiki ba.
It's a pleasant feeling.	Yana da dadi jin dadi.
He is not just talking.	Ba magana kawai yake yi ba.
It should not be so.	Bai kamata ya zama haka ba.
I never thought of that.	Ban taba tunanin haka ba.
They worked day and night.	Sun yi aiki ba dare ba rana.
I kept playing it, but it was done.	Na ci gaba da wasa da shi, amma an yi.
This task is not as simple as it seems.	Wannan aikin ba shi da sauƙi kamar yadda ake gani.
Everything is right, and right where it should be.	Duk abin da ya dace, kuma daidai inda ya kamata.
Everyone in the room was amazed.	Duk wanda ke cikin dakin ya yi mamaki.
I have never heard of such a thing.	Ban taɓa jin haka game da wani ba.
God will help us.	Allah zai taimake mu.
Police were called inside.	An kira 'yan sanda a ciki.
They will not know how to proceed.	Ba za su san yadda za su ci gaba ba.
Of course, there is also work.	Tabbas, akwai kuma aiki.
Otherwise you are in trouble.	In ba haka ba kuna cikin matsala.
Yet he felt something had changed.	Amma duk da haka ya ji wani abu ya canza.
He took the victory.	Ya dauki nasara.
And he got it slowly.	Kuma ya samu a hankali.
Nothing has changed.	Ba abin da ya canza.
I like reading	Ina son karatu
We can not do this again.	Ba mu iya yin wannan kuma.
So money works.	Haka kudi yayi aiki.
They asked him out well.	Suka tambaye shi da kyau.
But that is not true.	Amma hakan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Like everything you want.	Kamar duk abin da kuke so.
They are.	Su ne.
I'm just sorry they didn't do it.	Ina bakin ciki kawai sun kasa yi.
Sometimes you get that.	Wani lokaci kuna samun hakan.
One way or another.	Hanya ɗaya ko ɗaya.
She passed enough.	Ta wuce ta isa haka.
And they know it.	Kuma sun san shi.
He was arrested.	An kama shi.
But you get there.	Amma za ku shiga can.
Honestly after hearing it was gone early he gave it to her.	Da gaskiya bayan ya ji an tafi da wuri ya ba shi.
Take care of them.	Kula da su.
No one knows much about it.	Babu wanda ya san da yawa game da shi.
I generally do not understand what is going on here.	Gaba ɗaya ban fahimci abin da ke faruwa a nan ba.
That was over a week ago.	Hakan ya wuce mako guda da ya wuce.
Now we must be more precise.	Yanzu dole ne mu kasance mafi daidai.
You may be rejected.	Wataƙila a ƙi ku.
Travel to work.	Tafiya zuwa aiki.
It is not a good movie.	Ba fim mai kyau ba ne.
Here you are.	Ga mu nan.
She has so much to live for.	Tana da yawa don rayuwa.
But that has changed.	Amma hakan ya canza.
It does behind you.	Yana yi a bayan ka.
It's not a big deal.	Ba abu ne mai girma ba.
It is all we hope for.	Shi ne duk abin da muke fata.
In the rest of the time do whatever you want.	A cikin sauran lokaci yi duk abin da kuke so.
I hope there is a sure way.	Ina fata akwai wata hanya ta tabbata.
She was really fast.	Da gaske ta yi sauri.
Of course they want to succeed.	Tabbas suna son yin nasara.
Sometimes life is exciting.	Wani lokaci rayuwa tana da ban sha'awa.
This player has an amazing journey.	Wannan ɗan wasan yana da tafiya mai ban mamaki.
It's just some kind of thing.	Wani irin abu ne kawai.
I do not know where we are.	Ban san inda muke ba.
He is wearing a shirt.	Yana sanye da rigar riga.
Nothing to say about work.	Babu wani abu da za a ce game da aiki.
He showed interest.	Ya nuna sha'awa.
This article reviews the previous ones.	Wannan labarin ya sake duba na baya.
Maybe he can still protect her somehow.	Wataƙila har yanzu yana iya kare ta ko ta yaya.
If anything it will be tomorrow.	Idan wani abu zai tabbata gobe.
He had to tell her.	Sai da ya gaya mata.
The man is back there.	Mutumin yana yin baya a can.
This is our favorite.	Wannan shi ne abin da muka fi so.
I have to leave early.	Dole in tafi da wuri.
The plane took off to an unknown destination.	Jirgin ya tashi zuwa inda ba a sani ba.
Some do, and some do not.	Wasu suna yi, wasu kuma ba sa.
People all over the world are sick of that.	Mutane a duniya suna rashin lafiya da hakan.
It does not get cold there.	Ba ya yin sanyi a wurin.
I hope everyone had a great weekend.	Ina fatan kowa ya yi kyakkyawan karshen mako.
He had to read.	Sai da ya karanta.
And, of course, they did.	Kuma, tabbas, sun yi.
And yes, they are safe.	Kuma a, suna lafiya.
We started well this year.	Mun fara da kyau a wannan shekara.
He wants to.	Ya so.
So we sold some from there.	Sai muka sayar da wasu daga can.
It seemed like real.	Ya zama kamar gaske.
We cannot know for sure what is wrong.	Ba za mu iya sanin tabbas ba daidai ba ne.
Not fast enough, though.	Ba sauri isa ba, ko da yake.
She wouldn’t let me get it.	Ba za ta bari na samu ba.
She was surprised.	Ta yi mamaki.
It just.	Ya kawai.
He put me here.	Ya sanya ni nan.
No one can know.	Ba wanda zai iya sani.
I have been traveling for more than a month.	Ina da ɗan tafiya fiye da wata ɗaya.
It comes from years of work.	Ya zo daga shekaru na aiki.
But we always knew that the plan would appear.	Amma koyaushe mun san cewa shirin zai bayyana.
I feel she doesn't care what we think.	Ina jin ba ta damu da abin da muke tunani ba.
But she needs to know one way or another.	Amma tana bukatar sanin hanya ɗaya ko ɗaya.
He never hit it.	Bai taba buga shi ba.
They are here to kill us.	Suna nan su kashe mu.
Drinking water is bad.	Ruwan sha ba shi da kyau.
Go fast.	Tafi ya yi sauri.
They were in the past and they loved it.	Sun kasance a baya kuma suna son shi.
Try to be on time.	Yi ƙoƙari ku kasance kan lokaci.
She is ready.	Ta shirya.
She seems to have no problem progressing.	Ta ga alama ba ta da matsala ta ci gaba.
This is dead.	Wannan ya mutu.
I am no more.	Babu ni kuma.
I covered myself and waited.	Na rufe kaina ina jira.
Eat.	Ku ci.
It can get, though.	Yana iya samun, ko da yake.
But running changes everything.	Amma yin gudu ya canza komai.
God did so.	Allah yasa haka.
So it was fixed.	Don haka aka gyara.
She can wait.	Ta iya jira.
Something about this water did not feel like water.	Wani abu game da wannan ruwa bai ji kamar ruwa ba.
Maybe you are interested.	Wataƙila kuna sha'awar.
She made a mistake.	Ta yi kuskure.
There is nothing good about it.	Babu wani abu mai kyau game da shi.
They certainly were.	Lallai sun kasance.
To be honest, it left a lot to be desired.	Don gaskiya a gare ku, ya bar abubuwa da yawa.
I wish you all the best.	Ina muku fatan komai.
He wanted to do it himself.	Ya so ya yi da kan sa.
He finished everything.	Ya gama komai.
Talk is not here.	Magana ba ta nan.
It didn't come out much.	Bai fita da yawa ba.
She should not have discovered anything.	Bai kamata ta gano wani abu ba.
But she was.	Amma ta kasance .
I know things.	Na san abubuwa.
Not what she expected to hear.	Ba abin da ta yi tsammanin ji ba.
It's so amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki sosai.
He has an amazing wife and many children too.	Yana da mata mai ban mamaki da ’ya’ya da yawa kuma.
This is very good.	Wannan yayi kyau sosai.
I'll take this with you.	Zan tafi da wannan.
No, it is not enough.	A'a, bai isa ba.
You really like this and want more.	Kuna son wannan da gaske kuma kuna son ƙarin.
You can really go and come at any time.	Kuna iya gaske je ku zo a kowane lokaci.
I have to remember not to take things personally.	Dole ne in tuna kada in dauki abubuwa da kaina.
More than enough.	Fiye da isa.
Nice to meet you all.	Na yi farin cikin samun ku duka.
It was full of people.	Ya cika da mutane.
They are amazing.	Suna da ban mamaki.
It should not be necessary.	Bai kamata ya zama dole ba.
I need almost twice a weekend.	Ina bukata kusan sau biyu tsawon karshen mako.
Now, it's time.	Yanzu, lokaci ya yi.
And you love what he wants.	Kuma kuna son abin da yake so.
I ate.	Na ci abinci.
There’s nothing he can do about it, really.	Babu wani abu da zai iya yi game da shi, da gaske.
He knows it.	Ya san shi.
That worked for me at the time.	Hakan ya yi min aiki a lokacin.
The whole game is true.	Duk wasan gaskiya ne.
Enjoy life and be happy about it.	Ji daɗin rayuwa da lokacin farin ciki game da shi.
I have them eating well.	Ina da su suna ci sosai.
I do not feel that way.	Ba na jin haka.
This is not the case here.	Wannan ba abu bane a nan.
Their work is fast.	Aikin su yayi sauri.
This can also be eaten very well.	Wannan kuma ana iya ci sosai.
Turn it off completely.	Kashe shi gaba daya.
She gave me life.	Ta ba ni rai.
It is impossible to decide what to use.	Ba za a iya yanke shawarar abin da za a yi amfani da shi ba.
You just heard it.	Kun ji shi kawai.
You want to.	Kuna so.
We must.	Dole mu.
I prepared for it.	Na shirya don shi.
It is not clear how they did it.	Ba a fahimci yadda suke yin hakan ba.
It's not just the underdog, it's ridiculous.	Ba kawai wanda bai kai ba, abin dariya ne.
They travel with us.	Suna tafiya tare da mu.
I do not know him.	Ban san shi ba.
I must tell you, they are not very good.	Dole ne in gaya muku, ba su da kyau sosai.
It also hurts.	Hakan ma yayi zafi.
And you began to cry.	Kuma kuka fara kuka.
No 'so fast.	A'a' haka sauri.
Read it often.	Karanta shi sau da yawa.
He was very interested in taking advantage of the opportunity.	Ya yi matukar sha'awar yin amfani da damar.
In fact, that is not true.	A gaskiya, hakan ba gaskiya ba ne.
This seems to be the right way to go.	Wannan da alama hanya ce da ta dace don ci gaba.
One is the tool.	Daya shine kayan aiki.
We fit it.	Mun dace da shi.
Or do not accept it.	Ko kuma kar ku yarda da shi.
She will wait, and she waits for him.	Za ta jira, kuma tana jira a kai.
I want to cry	Ina son yin kuka
How did he get this job?	Ta yaya ya sami wannan aikin?
And now or never.	Kuma yanzu ko ba a taba ba.
He would not be interested in her.	Ba zai sha'awar ta ba.
They must be.	Dole ne su kasance.
To make sure he heard and understood what she was saying.	Don ya tabbata ya ji kuma ya gane abin da take cewa.
No one gets it better than me.	Babu wanda ya fi ni samun sa daga gare ni.
It will be a weekend at the beach.	Zai yi karshen mako a bakin ruwa.
It's so much easier.	Ya fi sauƙi haka.
I am from mine.	Ina daga nawa.
Something must have gone wrong there.	Dole ne a sami wani abu ba daidai ba a can.
I am a human being.	Ni mutum ne.
It's two people.	Wasu mutane biyu ne.
Everyone knows her there.	Kowa ya san ta a can.
Children do this often.	Yara suna yin hakan sau da yawa.
She knew she was not alone.	Ta san ba ita kaɗai ba.
When you travel, you can't bring anything.	Lokacin da kuke tafiya, ba za ku iya kawo komai ba.
I will pay it.	Zan biya shi.
Just wanted to check things out.	Kawai so ya duba abubuwa.
Caring for a dog is easy.	Kula da kare ya kasance mai sauƙi.
Initially the plan was not considered.	Tun farko ba a yi tunanin shirin ba.
We look forward to hearing from you.	Muna jiran ji daga gare ku.
What a surprise.	Wani abin mamaki.
Actually no one can.	A gaskiya babu wanda zai iya.
He has had it since he was a child.	Ya kasance yana da shi tun yana yaro.
Tom is looking for a new job.	Tom yana neman sabon aiki.
We will never do that again.	Ba za mu sake yin hakan ba.
Hope you enjoy yourself.	Da fatan za a ji daɗin kanku.
Whatever they had, they lost.	Duk abin da suke da shi, sun rasa.
Some things were unknown until then.	Wasu abubuwan da ba a san su ba har zuwa lokacin.
I thought too.	Ni ma na yi tunani.
It's very, very real.	Yana da matukar gaske, da gaske.
We can stay here.	Za mu iya zama a nan.
It should not be so.	Bai kamata ya kasance haka ba.
I went to check.	Na je na duba.
I started driving slowly.	Na fara tuƙi a hankali.
He wants to explain something to you.	Yana son ya bayyana maka wani abu.
Not required.	Ba a bukata.
This is correct.	Wannan daidai ne.
What, if anything, is wrong?	Me, idan wani abu, ba daidai ba?
The feeling was exciting and at the same time scary.	Jin ya kasance mai ban sha'awa kuma a lokaci guda mai ban tsoro.
This is being done now.	Ana yin wannan a yanzu.
This is a thought.	Wannan tunani ne.
They laughed for good.	Dariya suka yi don kyau.
She left me with this.	Ta bar ni da wannan.
We're more honest.	Mun fi gaskiya.
I talk to people a lot about it.	Ina yawan magana da mutane game da shi.
Of this, she was convinced.	Daga cikin wannan, ta tabbata.
That you do not even think so.	Cewa ba ku ma tunanin hakan.
But it doesn’t work here.	Amma ba ya aiki a nan.
This rain came in the morning.	Wannan ruwan sama ya zo da safe.
I've never seen one, you know.	Ban taba ganin daya ba, ka sani.
Without water, there is no life.	Idan babu ruwa, babu rayuwa.
Either way the plan stopped.	Ko ta yaya shirin ya tsaya.
We think we do.	Muna tsammanin muna yi.
That's all.	Haka kawai.
Take two years if you want.	Ɗauki shekaru biyu idan kuna so.
But again, this is our favorite thing, anyway.	Amma kuma, abin da muka fi so kenan, ko ta yaya.
There it is.	Akwai shi.
I want the whole movie to be that way.	Ina son duk fim ɗin ya kasance haka.
He said.	Ya fad'a.
People are married.	Mutane sun yi aure.
All kids love toys.	Duk yara suna son kayan wasan yara.
She sold.	Ta sayar.
Talk about a happy life.	Yi magana game da rayuwa mai dadi.
He got up.	Ya tashi.
Failed to work.	Ya kasa aiki.
This is for sure.	Wannan shi ne abin ta tabbas.
We were surprised that it could happen.	Mun yi mamakin cewa zai iya faruwa.
It can't work.	Ba zai iya yin aiki ba.
This works well.	Wannan yayi aiki da kyau.
He couldn't tell her, he couldn't make her see.	Bai iya gaya mata ba, ya kasa sa ta gani.
It's very interesting.	Yana da matukar ban sha'awa.
How long can you walk without water?	Har yaushe za ku iya tafiya ba tare da ruwa ba?
They are dead.	Sun mutu.
When the time comes, of course.	Idan lokaci ya zo, ba shakka.
But that did not help.	Amma wannan bai taimaka ba.
Of course not.	Tabbas bai samu ba.
Sometimes we even have women.	Wani lokaci ma muna da mata.
This is all true.	Wannan duk gaskiya ne.
Work on children.	Yi aiki a kan yara.
We only have today.	Muna da yau kawai.
And yet.	Kuma duk da haka.
I did a good job too.	Na yi aiki mai kyau kuma.
As you can see, this is a big house.	Kamar yadda kuke gani, wannan babban gida ne.
They are the ones who are getting into trouble.	Su ne ke samun matsala.
That's just it.	Wannan kawai.
We went with her to check it out.	Muka je da ita don mu duba.
She has a name.	Ta na da suna.
She will not save her goods.	Ba za ta ajiye mata kayan ba.
I missed him that night.	Na rasa shi a wannan daren.
God has wronged me.	Allah yayi min kuskure.
The car stopped quickly.	Motar ta tsaya da sauri.
Now it takes the two of them somewhere.	Yanzu yana kai su biyu a wani waje.
There is a lot of work to be done.	Akwai aiki da yawa da za a yi.
However, in general, this is not the case.	Duk da haka, a gaba ɗaya, wannan ba haka yake ba.
I never used it before bed.	Ban sake amfani da shi ba kafin barci.
She cries a lot.	Kuka take sosai.
Any thoughts go the way.	Duk wani tunani ya shiga hanya.
We are not like you.	Mu ba kamar ku muke ba.
This process can be continued as follows.	Ana iya ci gaba da wannan hanya kamar haka.
I know how it is now.	Na san yadda abin yake a yanzu.
But it is easy to forget the past altogether.	Amma yana da sauri a manta da abin da ya gabata gaba ɗaya.
And something happened.	Kuma wani abu ya faru.
He felt nothing.	Ya ji ba komai ba ne.
But he did not.	Amma bai yi ba.
Now we see each other and we go along with every opportunity we get.	Yanzu muna ganin juna kuma muna tafiya tare duk wata dama da muka samu.
You can be whoever you can be.	Kuna iya zama duk wanda kuke iya zama.
Nothing is there until everything is there.	Babu wani abu a wurin sai komai ya kasance a wurin.
We love you and we are here for you.	Muna son ku kuma muna nan a gare ku.
Somehow they no longer became real.	Ko ta yaya ba su ƙara zama na gaske ba.
But this should not be the case.	Amma wannan bai kamata ya zama haka ba.
He met her.	Ya hadu da ita.
Getting enough is over a month.	Samun isa ya wuce wata guda.
It is not enough.	Ba ta isa ba.
What can we do about it?	Me za mu iya yi game da wannan?
Here it is, however.	Ga shi, duk da haka.
Not here.	Ba a nan ba.
Or just to put it on.	Ko don kawai mu saka shi.
The right one will come in good time.	Wanda ya dace zai zo cikin lokaci mai kyau.
He found it to be good.	Ya gano cewa yana da kyau.
It shows on time.	Ya nuna akan lokaci.
You see what he did for us.	Kun ga abin da ya yi mana.
I enjoyed trying this tool.	Na ji daɗin gwada wannan kayan aikin.
They go in, and get up, into the day.	Suna shiga ta, suka tashi, zuwa rana.
Maybe not immediately, but immediately.	Wataƙila ba nan da nan ba, amma nan da nan.
I like it, but it is weak.	Ina son shi, amma shi mai rauni ne.
You know that can't happen.	Kun san hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
We never thought we would get married.	Ba mu taba tunanin za mu yi aure ba.
She does not believe that anyone can do without us.	Ba ta yarda cewa kowa zai iya yi ba in ba mu ba.
They are open.	Sun bude.
That's it.	Lokacin kenan .
He is not well at all.	Ba shi da lafiya gaba ɗaya.
Absolutely, its real.	Babu shakka, ainihin sa.
I asked him why he had changed.	Na tambaye shi dalilin da ya sa ya canza.
What's the matter.	Akwai matsala.
Just get used to it.	Sai kawai ka saba da shi.
Ita ma kenan.	Ita ma kenan.
I have to think about the future.	Dole ne in yi tunanin nan gaba.
He wonders how many others are ahead.	Yana mamakin sauran nawa ne a gaba.
Everything is gone.	Komai ya tafi.
That may not be the plan, however.	Wannan ba zai kasance shirin ba, duk da haka.
And not just here.	Kuma ba kawai a nan ba.
Remember, she said she saw him killed.	Ka tuna, ta ce ta ga an kashe shi.
I have to get up.	Dole na tashi.
She wanted this.	Ta so wannan.
I thought it was funny.	Na yi tunanin abin dariya ne.
It will hit.	Zai buga.
No one talked to each other anymore.	Ba wanda ya ƙara yin magana da juna.
And in adversity, people can be many.	Kuma a cikin wahala, mutane na iya zama da yawa.
He laughed at me again.	Ya sake bani dariya.
We wonder why, still.	Mun yi mamakin dalilin, har yanzu.
It feels so good.	Ya ji dadi sosai.
They are in amazement.	Suna cikin mamaki.
Really great deal.	A gaske mai girma da yawa.
But it is definitely difficult now.	Amma tabbas yana da wahala yanzu.
Now there is a problem.	Yanzu akwai matsala.
To do my own work.	Don yin da nawa aikin.
I do not know why you can not just live together.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa ba za ku iya zama tare kawai ba.
She seems to know everyone.	Kamar ta san kowa.
You do not spend more than you have.	Ba ku kashe fiye da abin da kuke da shi.
I want to die.	Ina so in mutu.
Maybe I was too at the time.	Wataƙila ni ma a lokacin.
But it will not do well.	Amma ba zai yi kyau ba.
It's better now.	Ya fi kyau yanzu.
Just wait time.	Jiran lokaci kawai.
Not sure where to start.	Ban tabbatar da inda zan fara ba.
Now there is no time.	Yanzu babu lokaci.
And the work paid off.	Kuma aikin ya biya.
I'm late for school.	Na makara zuwa makaranta.
That worked well.	Wannan yayi aiki mai kyau.
Where it should be.	Inda ya kamata ya kasance.
Check this out and this and this and that.	Duba wannan da wannan da wannan da wannan.
He recounted what happened.	Ya ba da labarin abin da ya faru.
As in.	Kamar yadda a .
I began to see the truth.	Na fara ganin gaskiya.
Big fish.	Babban kifi.
Is there a.	Akwai wani.
Something went wrong with the third tool in it.	Wani abu yayi kuskure tare da kayan aiki na uku a ciki.
Which we will get.	Wanda za mu samu.
I think they had a great year.	Ina tsammanin sun yi kyakkyawan shekara mai kyau.
But you do not hear.	Amma ba ku ji.
Nothing to come.	Babu wani abu mai zuwa.
I do not know if this is the right time.	Ban sani ba ko wannan shine lokacin da ya dace.
The hot water is gone.	Ruwan zafi ya kare.
We came here with one thing.	Mun zo nan da abu daya.
Maybe he failed.	Wataƙila ya kasa.
They grow hard.	Sun yi girma da wuya.
It didn't do me any good.	Bai yi min kyau ba.
I killed myself from it.	Na kashe kaina daga gare ta.
I make good money.	Ina samun kudi mai kyau.
So we turned off the water.	Sai muka kashe ruwan.
He was very surprised.	Yayi mamaki sosai.
The bigger the better.	Mafi girma shine mafi kyau.
This did not do very well.	Wannan bai yi kyau sosai ba.
Of course she never came.	Tabbas bata taba zuwa ba.
To put on a shirt.	Don saka riga.
As she wishes.	Kamar yadda take so.
People can live in water too.	Mutane na iya rayuwa a cikin ruwa kuma.
And they agreed.	Kuma sun yarda da su.
They looked so good too.	Sun yi kyau sosai kuma.
She 'read' the article carefully.	Ta 'karanta' labarin a hankali.
Some years we did not get rain, and some we did too much.	Wasu shekaru ba mu sami ruwan sama ba, wasu kuma mun yi yawa.
I'm leaving now but let me add a little more.	Na tafi yanzu amma bari in kara wannan kadan.
She hopes some help comes from outside.	Ta yi fatan wani taimako ya zo daga waje.
I love everyone at home.	Ina son kowa a gida.
This happened very quickly.	Wannan ya faru da sauri.
He did nothing out of the ordinary.	Bai yi wani abin tsoro ba.
I have a job for you.	Ina da aiki a gare ku.
I think three kids are enough.	Ina tsammanin yara uku sun isa.
That can't be imagined right now.	Ba za a iya tunanin hakan ba a yanzu.
When we arrived we could enter without any problems.	Lokacin da muka isa za mu iya shiga ba tare da wata matsala ba.
He was surprised.	Ya yi mamaki.
I am very happy and excited for you.	Ina matukar farin ciki da farin ciki a gare ku.
It has nothing to do with that.	Ba shi da abin cewa.
I have made no progress.	Na sami ci gaba babu.
But it is something else.	Amma wani abu ne.
And he did.	Kuma yayi.
Somehow she lost.	Ko yaya ta rasa.
I have been walking for a long time.	Na dade ina tafiya.
He wanted me to bring it to him.	Ya so in kawo masa.
The dog will know.	Kare zai sani.
I agree to keep your name.	Na yarda da ajiye sunan ku.
It is hot there.	Akwai zafi a wurin.
But still no one killed anyone.	Amma har yanzu babu wanda ya kashe kowa.
In fact, it can be amazing.	A gaskiya ma, yana iya zama mai ban mamaki.
There is only this.	Akwai wannan kawai.
Anyone can make a mistake.	Kowa na iya yin kuskure.
So we had to fight a little bit.	Don haka sai mun dan yi fada.
But we are what we are.	Amma mu ne abin da muke.
I guess that was it.	Ina tsammanin abin da ya kasance.
But it turned out to be a lie.	Amma ya bayyana karya ne.
Now it is not so.	Yanzu ba haka ba ne.
That is a big deal.	Hakan yana da girma.
He is still in the house, no one.	Har yanzu yana cikin gidan, babu kowa.
It comes slowly.	Ya zo a hankali.
Let's move on to the rest.	Mu koma ga sauran.
He looked for a place to smoke.	Ya nemi inda zai kashe taba.
However, we now know that one is not enough.	Duk da haka, yanzu mun san cewa daya bai isa ba.
They want to be what they are not.	Suna so su zama abin da ba su kasance ba.
Not much happens.	Ba abu mai yawa ke faruwa ba.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
There is only one problem.	Matsala daya ce kawai.
It started this way.	Ya fara ta wannan hanya.
So we were very surprised and, of course, very happy.	Don haka mun yi mamaki sosai kuma, ba shakka, muna farin ciki sosai.
Act like a person.	Yi kamar mutum.
The journey continues.	Tafiya ta ci gaba.
It takes a while.	Yana ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
This is where she is expected.	A nan ne ake tsammanin ta.
And the heat did not bother him.	Kuma zafi bai damu ba.
And do not ask exactly what is going to happen.	Kuma kar a tambayi ainihin abin da zai faru.
But then she broke it for me, hardly.	Amma sai ta karya min shi, da wuya.
But if you make a mistake.	Amma idan kun yi kuskure.
Look, finally, we got rain!	Duba, a ƙarshe, mun sami ruwan sama!
So it 's amazing.	Don haka abin mamaki ne.
But you know what people are saying.	Amma ka san abin da mutane ke cewa.
They can always play together.	Kullum suna iya wasa tare.
Here it is.	Ga kuma ita.
I like reading	Ina son karatu
He apologized.	Ya ba shi hakuri.
I still have two people.	Har yanzu ina da mutane biyu.
I did not think of anything.	Ban yi tunanin komai ba.
The game is not over.	Wasan bai kare ba.
Will you bring me?	Za ku zo da ni?
This is the real way.	Wannan shi ne ainihin hanyar.
It was made for the day.	An yi shi don ranar.
Once.	Sau ɗaya.
I beg to differ? 	Ban yarda ba?
Do not enter this game.	Kar ku shiga wannan wasan.
We know how it was.	Mun san yadda abin ya kasance.
The world is a world.	Duniya duniya ce.
There are some interesting things going on here.	Akwai abubuwa masu ban sha'awa da ke faruwa a nan.
This is the first time people have heard of me.	Wannan shine karo na farko da mutane suka ji ni.
People still want to do something.	Har yanzu mutane suna son yin wani abu.
You can’t get better than that.	Ba za ku iya samun mafi kyau fiye da haka ba.
It looks really good.	Ya yi kama da gaske.
One thing or another.	Wani abu ko wani.
In you go.	A cikin ku tafi.
So, go out and eat!	Don haka kuma, ku fita ku ci!
He can take them one by one.	Zai iya ɗaukar su ɗaya bayan ɗaya.
The new restaurant is near the train station.	Sabon gidan abincin yana kusa da tashar jirgin kasa.
After this man.	Bayan wannan mutumin.
This is not going to be very interesting on its own.	Wannan ba zai zama da ban sha'awa sosai ita kaɗai ba.
That is better.	Hakan ya fi kyau.
No one wants to be told what to do.	Ba wanda yake son a gaya masa abin da zai yi.
He did not know the ship very well.	Bai san jirgin sosai ba.
Knowing that is not right for me is not enough.	Sanin hakan bai dace da ni ba bai isa ba.
He would not make such a mistake.	Ba zai yi kuskure irin wannan ba.
I have no one to help me.	Ba ni da wanda zai taimake ni.
Even if they do not have water.	Ko har ba su da ruwa.
Now and then and now, what exactly is here.	Yanzu da yanzu da kuma yanzu, menene ainihin a nan.
There is still plenty of room for error.	Har yanzu akwai wuri da yawa don kuskure.
And go.	Kuma tafi.
Absolutely.	Tabbas.
That would be even more difficult.	Hakan zai fi wuya.
I can walk with this.	Zan iya tafiya da wannan.
No much.	A'a da yawa.
It is a difficult task.	Aiki ne mai wahala.
She got it.	Ta samu.
Wrong mistake.	Ba daidai ba kuskure.
Call it night.	Kira shi dare.
But we are close.	Amma muna kusa.
Many people get sick every year.	Mutane da yawa suna yin rashin lafiya kowace shekara.
You must stop.	Lallai yakamata ku tsaya.
But it surprised me again.	Amma ya sake bani mamaki.
Look around the room.	Ku kalli dakin.
We always go to school.	Kullum muna tafiya makaranta.
However, they died.	Duk da haka, sun mutu.
Just did not want to say.	Kamar ba ya so ya ce.
We talked a little bit about it.	Mun dan yi magana a kai.
One day the police may come.	Wata rana 'yan sanda na iya zuwa.
I am just myself again.	Ni kawai kaina sake.
It did not appear.	Bai bayyana ba.
Let me know how much you need.	Bari in san nawa kuke bukata.
So even that is a good thing.	Don haka ko da hakan abu ne mai kyau.
But there is not much we can do.	Amma babu wani abu da yawa da za mu iya yi.
He celebrated.	Ya yi bikin.
But not now, not like this.	Amma ba yanzu, ba kamar wannan ba.
No one really cared.	Babu wanda ya kula shi sosai.
Only one entrance will not do.	Wurin shiga ɗaya kawai ba zai yi ba.
The night is cold.	Dare yayi sanyi.
One thing has not changed.	Abu daya bai canza ba.
One year ago.	Shekara daya da ta wuce.
You must let it go.	Dole ne ku bar shi ya tafi.
This is a debt we cannot repay.	Wannan bashi ne ba za mu iya biya ba.
He came very close to you.	Ya zo kusa da ku sosai.
It was a car passing slowly.	Mota ce ta wuce a hankali.
We will not travel further.	Ba za mu kara tafiya ba.
Or, you know, early on.	Ko, ka sani, da wuri da wuri.
I was completely sick.	Na yi rashin lafiya gaba ɗaya.
I like this better.	Ina son wannan mafi kyau.
You have to agree with me about that.	Dole ne ku yarda da ni game da hakan.
It is very hot in the world.	Akwai zafi sosai a duniya.
Not yet.	Ba tukuna ba.
Think, if you can.	Ka yi tunani, idan za ka iya.
The train did not change course.	Jirgin kasa bai canza hanya ba.
A man drank water.	Wani mutum ya sha ruwa.
But the man did not listen.	Amma mutumin bai ji ba.
Be careful with that.	Yi hankali da wannan.
I want to have people.	Ina son samun mutane.
And he was right.	Kuma ya zama daidai.
She saw what had happened before.	Ta ga abin ya faru a baya.
I don’t want to talk about it yet.	Ba na son magana game da shi duk da haka.
So far, it appears that everything is working.	Har zuwa yanzu, ya bayyana cewa komai yana aiki.
It hurts.	Yana jin zafi.
One too many.	Daya yayi yawa.
He knew something was wrong.	Ya san wani abu bai yi daidai ba.
He will wait.	Zai jira.
That opportunity has come.	Wannan damar ta zo.
Nothing big.	Babu babban abu.
He would like to go.	Zai so tafiya.
Everyone needs a car today!	Kowa yana buƙatar mota a yau!
You are good when it is finished.	Kuna da kyau idan an gama.
At that moment he passed the room.	A wannan lokacin ya wuce dakin.
Run it.	Gudu da shi.
However, let it go.	Duk da haka, bari ya tafi.
But they want to be careful.	Amma suna son yin hankali.
He did not do it right.	Bai yi daidai ba.
But she is more than that.	Amma ta fi haka.
And the last will be the first.	Kuma na ƙarshe zai zama na farko.
Then he did not go.	Sai ba tafi ba.
Of course, you know better than that.	Tabbas kun fi wannan sani.
First, you do things.	Na ɗaya, kuna yin abubuwa.
It's too hot.	Yayi zafi sosai.
Maybe it made me sick.	Watakila ya yi mini rashin lafiya.
But then she got up at work.	Amma sai ta tashi cikin aiki.
The fish will look really good.	Kifi zai yi kyau sosai.
Gradually he got up from his seat.	A hankali ya tashi daga zaune.
I have to get out of it.	Dole na fita daga ciki.
You should do it now, in fact.	Ya kamata ku yi shi a yanzu, a gaskiya.
He told us everything he did that day.	Ya gaya mana duk abin da ya yi a ranar.
In showing himself.	Cikin nuna kansa.
The food is very good.	Abincin yana da kyau sosai.
He was very happy to hear the news.	Yayi matukar farin ciki da jin labarin.
I saw what surprised him.	Na ga abin ya ba shi mamaki.
And it is amazing.	Kuma abin mamaki ne.
He got a lot of way tonight.	Ya samu hanya da yawa a daren yau.
But he would not mind.	Amma ba zai damu ba.
They thought it was funny.	Sun dauka abin dariya ne.
It grows on me.	Yana girma a kaina.
This book is well written.	An rubuta wannan littafin sosai.
No it didn't work.	A'a bai yi aiki ba.
But it's good.	Amma yana da kyau.
We could not find a place.	Ba mu iya samun wuri ba.
They said it was good.	Suka ce abin ya yi kyau.
Yet they celebrated.	Amma duk da haka sun yi bikin.
I do not mind.	Ban damu ba.
We are not yet ready for that.	Har yanzu ba mu shirya don hakan ba.
We would have all died.	Da mun mutu duka.
Sorry about that.	Yi hakuri da komai.
But he did not understand until the next morning.	Amma bai gane ba sai da safe.
That will not help.	Hakan ba zai taimaka ba.
She lied in the past.	Ta yi karya a baya.
I have to tell her.	Dole in gaya mata.
You can suggest some ideas.	Kuna iya ba da shawarar wasu abubuwan tunani.
He is still alive.	Har yanzu yana da rai.
He told me to go and see who it was.	Ya sake cewa in je in ga ko wanene.
You have a beautiful home.	Kuna da kyakkyawan gida mai kyau.
This seems too easy to conclude.	Wannan ga alama ma sauƙi ƙarshe.
One year passed.	Shekara daya ta wuce.
Do not change anything.	Kada ku canza komai.
It's not that easy.	Ba shi da sauƙi haka.
We can not live here.	Ba za mu iya zama a nan ba.
Please don't leave me.	Don Allah kar a bar ni.
I will never play again.	Ba zan sake yin wasa ba.
The project was a success.	Aikin ya yi nasara.
Pay me now.	Biya ni yanzu.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
We were told that the police were on the road.	An gaya mana cewa ’yan sanda suna kan hanya.
We are there.	Muna kan wurin.
I think this is going to be a big game.	Ina tsammanin wannan zai zama babban wasa.
There is no happiness in material things.	Ba a samun farin ciki a cikin abin duniya.
Still waiting for that.	Har yanzu jiran hakan.
Can you help me with my homework?	Za a iya taimaka mini da aikin gida na?
I always break right.	Kullum ina karya daidai.
I will do what is needed to make that happen.	Zan yi abin da ake bukata don ganin hakan ta faru.
She also wants to hear.	Ita ma tana son ji.
It just leads to a big job.	Sai kawai ya kai ga babban aiki.
I still eat fish.	Har yanzu ina cin kifi.
This was easy to do.	Wannan ya kasance mai sauƙi don yin.
It gets better and better with time.	Yana samun kyau kuma yana da kyau tare da lokaci.
We certainly grew up.	Lallai mun girma.
It should look really good.	Ya kamata yayi kyau sosai.
How you work.	Yadda kuke aiki.
No one knows how to do it.	Ba wanda ya san yadda za a yi da shi.
I think it is true.	Ina ganin gaskiya ne.
That could not be right!	Wannan ba zai iya zama daidai ba!
Is that correct?	Shin hakan yayi daidai?
He has been waiting for home for a long time.	Ya dade yana jiran gida.
It was very tasty and many people loved it.	Ya kasance mai dadi sosai kuma mutane da yawa suna son shi.
They were given food and water.	An ba su abinci da ruwan sha.
That just doesn't work.	Wannan kawai baya aiki.
You are being watched.	Ana kallon ku.
Why don't you come?	Me ya sa ba za ku zo ba?
Again, log in.	Sake, shiga.
We sent him to see what happened.	Mun aika shi mu ga abin da ya faru.
It's just common.	Na kowa ne kawai.
I don't care where you come from.	Ban damu da kai ko daga ina ka fito ba.
But then he thought a second time.	Amma sai ya yi tunani na biyu.
They eat.	Suna ci.
One can do this for a short time.	Mutum na iya yin haka na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Not logged in.	Ba a shiga ba.
But she will return to talking.	Amma zata koma magana.
You do not have to ask anyone how they are.	Ba sai ka tambayi kowa yadda suke ba.
In addition, he added, check.	Ban da haka, ya kara da cewa, ku duba.
The truth can be interesting.	Gaskiya na iya zama mai ban sha'awa.
But often things do not go as planned.	Amma sau da yawa abubuwa ba kamar yadda suke ba.
That he could see.	Cewa ya iya gani.
It looks scary.	Kallon tsoro yayi.
How he died.	Yadda ya mutu.
Everything she gained and everything she lost.	Duk abin da ta samu da duk abin da za ta rasa.
There was a man there.	Akwai wani mutum a wurin.
I am more than happy to know that.	Na fi jin daɗin sanin hakan.
I told her we were not looking for food.	Na ce mata ba mu nemi abinci ba.
Everything is over.	Komai yana kan.
But she came up with everything.	Amma ta fito da komai.
I do not mind.	Ban damu ba.
We will get everyone on this.	Za mu sami kowa akan wannan.
And it is difficult to explain.	Kuma yana da wuya a bayyana shi.
Don't tell him.	Ba fada masa ba.
Not immediately.	Ba nan take ba.
She knew everything would be fine.	Ta san komai zai yi kyau.
Do not tell anyone exactly what is happening.	Kada ka gaya wa kowa ainihin abin da ke faruwa.
It's all just true.	Duk gaskiya ne kawai.
He does this for everyone.	Yana yin haka ga kowa da kowa.
You still need to work every day.	Har yanzu kuna buƙatar yin aiki kowace rana.
Work for me !.	Aiki a gare ni!.
Maybe these will come in time.	Wataƙila waɗannan za su zo da lokaci.
But there is something else there.	Amma akwai wani abu kuma a can.
She wanted to tell the story this time.	Ta so ta ba da labarin wannan lokacin.
The door opened.	Kofar gida ta bude.
I don't know her very well.	Ban san ta sosai ba.
But there is no way.	Amma babu wata hanya.
So nothing really should be said.	Don haka babu abin da ya kamata a ce da gaske.
But this last step is not the first.	Amma wannan hanya ta ƙarshe ba ta kai ta farko ba.
Hard to say.	Da wuya a ce.
Not today though.	Ba yau ko.
It took a while before we realized it.	Ya dauki lokaci kafin mu gane shi.
Everyone knows how it is.	Kowa ya san yadda take.
Then something amazing happened.	Sai wani abu mai ban mamaki ya faru.
Not surprisingly, they are not very helpful.	Ba abin mamaki ba, ba su da taimako sosai.
But this thing.	Amma wannan abu .
The world wants to talk about how it is.	Duniya tana son magana akan yadda take.
This for the best.	Wannan don mafi kyau.
I can't live without you.	Ba zan iya rayuwa ba tare da ku ba.
This is the day everything has changed.	Wannan ita ce ranar da komai ya canza.
Only after the meeting.	Sai bayan taron.
Not everyone does that.	Ba kowa ne ke yin hakan ba.
We have to think.	Dole ne mu yi tunani.
The door is open.	K'ofar gida ta bud'e.
I will do something with it.	Zan yi wani abu da shi.
Kids love it.	Yara suna son shi.
She is still wearing a checked dress.	Har yanzu tana sanye da rigar da aka duba.
Lack must leave you.	Rashin dole ne ya bar ku.
It's almost eleven.	Kusan sha daya ne.
Some are true and some are false.	Wasu gaskiya ne wasu kuma karya ne.
We may never hear of them, but we do know that they exist.	Wataƙila ba za mu taɓa jin su ba, amma mun san cewa akwai su.
That's what you do.	Abin da kuke yi ke nan.
However, this is a thought.	Duk da haka, wannan tunani ne.
And they began to speak.	Sai suka fara magana.
It will appear.	Zai bayyana.
There’s more where that comes from, always.	Akwai ƙarin inda hakan ya fito, koyaushe.
I still speak for myself.	Har yanzu ina magana da kaina.
That is how you will continue.	Haka za ku ci gaba.
I will have a good night.	Zan lafiya dare.
I see you are talking to this person.	Na ga kana magana da wannan mutumin.
What they don’t know right now won’t hurt.	Abin da ba su sani ba a yanzu ba zai yi zafi ba.
It will do just fine.	Zai yi daidai.
No one is visible.	Babu kowa a gani.
The rest is nothing.	Sauran ba komai.
Nothing, really.	Ba komai , da gaske.
I grew up early.	Na girma da wuri.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
No wonder women love it.	Ba mamaki mata suna son sa.
I want to check.	Ina so in duba.
He stopped hearing her.	Ya daina jin ta.
Put it another way.	Sanya shi wata hanya.
They need you when they need you.	Suna buƙatar ku lokacin da suke buƙatar ku.
So far this has worked for me.	Ya zuwa yanzu hakan ya yi min aiki.
Wrong, he thought.	Ba daidai ba ne, ya yi tunani.
Some of us have only one God.	Wasu daga cikin mu kawai sun wuce allah ɗaya.
I am a human being	Ni mutum ne
Before you even ask.	Kafin ma sai ka nemi.
We want to go out.	Mun so fita.
People may think a little.	Mutane na iya yin tunani kaɗan kaɗan.
Please help.	Da fatan za a nemi taimako.
You want them to be safe.	Kuna so su sami lafiya.
The doctor will try to find out the cause of the problem.	Likitan zai yi ƙoƙari ya gano dalilin matsalar.
He probably wouldn't do that.	Da alama ba zai yi haka ba.
They know you are interested so you better call others.	Sun san kuna sha'awar don haka gara ku kira wasu.
He did not feel comfortable, but he did not say anything.	Bai ji dadi ba, amma bai ce komai ba.
This is not a big surprise.	Wannan ba wani babban abin mamaki ba ne.
They have no idea about it.	Ba su da wani tunani game da shi.
Nothing will look like it.	Ba abin da zai yi kama.
Make it work.	Sanya shi aiki.
And they arrested me.	Kuma suka kama ni.
In instant action, no.	A cikin aikin nan take, babu.
This was done until he reached his destination.	Haka aka yi ta yi har ya isa inda ya ke.
Maybe you too.	Wataƙila za ku ma.
I decided to leave.	Na yanke shawarar barin.
I am still here.	Har yanzu ina nan.
But they feel there is something in it.	Amma sun ji akwai wani abu a ciki.
What do you want to happen?	Me kuke so ya faru?
It is something to be seen.	Abu ne da za a gani.
Now he knows what.	Yanzu ya san menene.
Last night, before the world ended.	Daren jiya, kafin duniya ta kare.
Almost never done.	Kusan da alama ba a yi ba.
If any.	Idan akwai.
Kneeling with someone.	Gwiwa da wani.
And make no mistake, that is what it used to be.	Kuma kada ku yi kuskure, ita ce abin da ta kasance.
Then she talked to me.	Sai ta yi min magana.
It rains all year round.	Ana ruwan sama a duk shekara.
This will take money.	Wannan zai dauki kudi.
Tomorrow they will be taken to a safe house.	Ana gobe za a kai su wani gida mai lafiya.
Therefore, their beauty is given to him.	Saboda haka, kyawun su an ba shi.
A lot of things went into it.	Abubuwa da yawa ta shiga ciki.
The population continues to grow.	Yawan ya ci gaba da girma.
And you are right.	Kuma kun yi daidai.
It's fine, though.	Yana da kyau, ko da yake.
At first she thought it was a thought.	Da farko ta dauka tunani ne.
I want to do it again.	Ina so in sake yin hakan.
I think they tried to do that.	Ina tsammanin sun yi ƙoƙarin yin hakan.
I work every day.	Ina aiki kowace rana.
But we do not know.	Amma ba mu sani ba.
This is a mistake here.	Wannan a nan kuskure ne.
You can not just print it.	Ba za ku iya buga shi kawai ba.
Let's just talk.	Mu yi magana kawai.
I hope you are home and feeling better than ever.	Ina fatan kuna gida kuma kuna jin daɗi fiye da kowane lokaci.
I will not let him die.	Ba zan bar shi ya mutu ba.
It is not necessary.	Ba dole ba ne.
You do not have to speak except one.	Ba sai ka yi magana ba sai daya.
This restaurant is known for its food.	An san wannan gidan cin abinci don abinci.
Of course this is a problem.	Tabbas wannan matsala ce.
She still feels.	Har yanzu tana ji.
No one knows but us.	Babu wanda ya sani sai mu.
Sad	Bakin ciki
He will stay here, with me.	Zai zauna a nan, tare da ni.
You can't do anything.	Ba za ku iya yin komai ba.
Much still.	Da yawa har yanzu.
I was told.	Ni ake so.
Women have no place.	Mata ba su da wuri.
It is one life.	Rai daya ce.
It has something to say about this.	Yana da abin da za a ce game da wannan.
And I think what he said was exactly how he felt.	Kuma ina tsammanin abin da ya faɗa shi ne ainihin yadda yake ji.
Of course, that is what happened.	Tabbas, hakan ya sa hakan ya faru.
The rain began to fall.	Ruwan sama ya fara gudu.
I read everything they wrote to me.	Na karanta duk abin da suka rubuta mini.
This fear has no place.	Wannan tsoro ba shi da wuri.
He wanted that.	Ya so haka.
Never cry, and never run.	Kada ku taɓa yin kuka, kuma kada ku taɓa gudu.
Try to get a good night's sleep.	Yi ƙoƙarin samun barci mai kyau.
This should happen.	Wannan ya kamata ya faru.
I added mine.	Na kara nawa.
Some people find the hard way.	Wasu mutane suna gano hanya mai wuya.
Otherwise, he will kill her.	In ba haka ba, zai kashe ta.
No one can explain why this happened.	Babu wanda zai iya bayyana dalilin da ya sa hakan ya faru.
We need them healthy and happy.	Muna bukatar su lafiya da farin ciki.
Slowly she closed the door.	A hankali ta rufe kofar.
I am not well known.	Ba a san ni sosai ba.
He stood behind me.	Ya tsaya a baya na.
We make it easy.	Muna yin shi mai sauƙi.
It is raining.	Ruwan sama ya fara yi.
She kept him away from home.	Ta ajiye shi daga gida.
Of course we went two or three times.	Tabbas mun tafi sau biyu ko uku.
He was afraid he would fall to his knees.	Ya ji tsoron kada ya yi kasa a gwiwa.
Surprising, isn’t it?	Abin mamaki, ko ba haka ba?
Maybe a lot of things.	Wataƙila abubuwa da yawa.
I know exactly.	Na sani daidai.
These make a great, interesting drink.	Waɗannan suna yin babban abin sha mai ban sha'awa.
Hard to hear.	Da wuya a ji.
This is not the case.	Wannan ba haka yake ba.
However, it may not be.	Duk da haka, yana iya zama babu.
You do not have this when you die.	Ba ku da wannan lokacin da kuka mutu.
She doesn't trust anyone, you know.	Bata yarda da kowa ba, ka sani.
But we are together now.	Amma muna tare yanzu.
The car is full.	Motar ta cika.
I love them so much.	Ina son su sosai.
You only get one chance.	Kuna samun dama guda ɗaya kawai.
Let it go.	Bar shi.
I can help you change.	Zan iya taimaka muku canza.
The back door stood open.	Kofar bayan gida ta tsaya a bude.
Listen, enough about it.	Ji, isa game da shi.
It is a hot and humid day.	Rana ce mai zafi da zafi.
We have everything we want, you know.	Muna da duk abin da muke so, ka sani.
But it works.	Amma haka yake aiki.
You will not make a mistake.	Ba za ku yi kuskure ba.
Or it happened at the same time.	Ko kuma ya faru a lokaci guda.
I was scared, honestly.	Na ji tsoro, gaskiya.
I feel so surprised.	Ina jin mamaki sosai.
He knew what to say before she said it.	Ya san abin da za ta ce kafin ta ce.
Let's assume it's fake.	Bari mu ɗauka cewa karya ne.
I am not interested at this time.	Ba ni da sha'awar wannan lokacin.
We do that a lot.	Muna yin hakan da yawa.
You will do well, you will do.	Za ku yi kyau, za ku yi.
He is on his way.	Yana kan tafiya.
Surprisingly.	Abin mamaki.
No chance at all.	Babu dama ko kadan.
He is also intelligent.	Shi ma mai hankali ne.
Or maybe not.	Ko watakila a'a.
Until then, everything went smoothly.	Har zuwa wannan lokacin, komai ya tafi yadda ya kamata.
They know we have to do something about it now.	Sun san cewa dole ne mu yi wani abu game da shi yanzu.
He stopped eating, but continued to work.	Ya daina cin abinci, amma ya ci gaba da aiki.
You could get hurt or even kill yourself.	Kuna iya samun rauni ko ma kashe kanku.
I don't like it very much.	Ba na son sa sosai.
Disable any visible objects.	Kashe duk wani abu da yake da alama.
I should have spoken.	Ya kamata in yi magana.
We must be careful.	Dole ne mu yi hankali.
Thoughts on work.	Tunani akan aiki.
Of course, we can go right.	Tabbas, za mu iya zuwa daidai.
And he was.	Kuma ya kasance.
I caught two at the same time more than once.	Na kama biyu a lokaci guda fiye da sau ɗaya.
You need to give people time.	Kuna buƙatar ba mutane lokaci.
Something is wrong here.	Wani abu ba daidai ba a nan.
It's all there.	Duk a wurin yake.
It was a great surprise for all of us.	Babban abin mamaki ne a gare mu duka.
Maybe you see that.	Watakila ka ga haka.
I'm just talking.	Ina yin magana ne kawai.
It will do a great job.	Za ta yi babban aiki.
Just keep walking.	Ci gaba da tafiya kawai.
No, not cold, he realized.	A'a, ba sanyi, ya gane.
I finished running.	Na gama gudu.
Do not kill me.	Kar ku kashe ni.
I told you before.	Na gaya muku a baya.
Even if she were.	Ko da ta kasance .
We have to keep going.	Dole ne mu ci gaba.
And for me.	Kuma a gare ni.
However, things are not easy today.	Duk da haka, abubuwa ba su da sauƙi a yau.
Of course not a benefit.	Tabbas ba wani amfani ba ne.
I know better.	Na fi sani.
I still can't make it.	Har yanzu na kasa sanya shi.
They want to look really good.	Suna so su yi kama sosai.
However, it is not.	Duk da haka, ba haka ba ne.
On time tomorrow.	A kan lokaci gobe.
You will not enter.	Ba za ku shiga ba.
I think we are here to make a good living.	Ina tsammanin muna nan don yin rayuwa mai kyau.
Our work is not over.	Aikin mu bai kare ba.
Don't let me catch you.	Kar ka bari na kama ka.
Maybe this is not a bad thing.	Wataƙila wannan ba mummunan abu ba ne.
But maybe enough.	Amma watakila ya isa.
You know the truth she told us.	Ka san gaskiya ta fada mana.
No one has anything interesting.	Babu wanda yake da wani abu mai ban sha'awa.
But it does not fit anyway.	Amma bai dace ba ko ta yaya.
I can not speak at all.	Ba zan iya magana ko komai ba.
I have to be like him.	Dole ne in zama kamar shi.
I think that will help.	Ina tsammanin hakan zai taimaka.
But no.	Amma babu.
I'm not interested.	Ba ni da ban sha'awa.
You tell me to get up.	Ke ce in tashi.
Coffee was a big mistake.	Kofi ya kasance babban kuskure.
I'm looking.	Ina duba.
It is true.	Gaskiya ce.
Everyone loves all of this.	Kowa yana son wannan duka.
I think that's right.	Ina ganin hakan daidai ne.
If you are tired, you can't do it.	Idan kun gaji, ba za ku iya yin hakan ba.
They are amazing!	Suna da ban sha'awa!
He put the right players in the right place to win.	Ya sanya 'yan wasan da suka dace a wurin da ya dace don yin nasara.
She did not stay with him.	Ba ta zauna masa ba.
Or, really, everyone.	Ko, da gaske, kowa.
But it is definitely not a sign.	Amma shi ba shakka ba alama ba ne.
But not mine.	Amma ba nawa ba ne.
But do not be afraid.	Amma kada ka ji tsoro.
Hope you are here.	Da fatan kun kasance a nan.
I never played again.	Ban sake buga wasa ba.
It is not enough just to have the tools.	Bai isa kawai samun kayan aikin ba.
If nothing happens, you better go.	Idan babu abin da ya faru, kuna da kyau ku tafi.
So many times, she thought.	Da yawa haka wani lokacin, ta yi tunani.
That can lead to your death.	Hakan na iya sa ku kashe ku.
I killed this one, though.	Na kashe wannan, ko da yake.
It certainly worked for us.	Tabbas ya yi mana aiki sosai.
On the go.	A tafiya.
There is nothing better than that.	Babu wani abu da ya fi wannan.
Do not eat me.	Kar ka ci ni.
But there is knowledge and the real culprit has been found.	Amma akwai sani kuma an ga ainihin wanda ya yi haka.
He did not know how he got there.	Bai san yadda ya kai can ba.
She wanted to do everything.	Ta so ta yi komai.
We must imitate that.	Dole ne mu yi koyi da hakan.
Great job.	Babban aiki.
Should we worry?	Ya kamata mu damu?
What are you going to do.	Me za ku je.
The train came second.	Jirgin ya zo na biyu.
I never thought of that.	Ban yi tunanin wannan ba.
It is not.	Ba shine.
He understood why they did not.	Ya fahimci dalilin da ya sa ba su yi ba.
The others are talking.	Sauran suna magana.
Either way, it’s probably better.	A wata hanya, tabbas ya fi kyau.
They need to understand how to read in the future.	Suna bukatar su fahimci yadda za su karanta nan gaba.
Not kids, right.	Ba yara bane, daidai.
Often, someone called me and asked me where something was.	Sau da yawa, wani ya kira ni ya tambaye ni inda wani abu yake.
You say we will continue as if it were not so.	Kun ce za mu ci gaba kamar ba haka ba.
You can not imagine that.	Ba za ku iya tunanin haka ba.
And yet he was already in love with someone.	Kuma duk da haka ya riga ya kasance yana son wani.
But you can not be like that.	Amma ba za ku iya zama haka ba.
People like you.	Mutane kamar ku.
He took another.	Ya dauki wani.
What a great thought.	Yaya babban tunani.
Travel has helped in the past and is now working.	Tafiya ya taimaka a baya kuma yana aiki yanzu.
But something else happened.	Amma wani abu kuma ya faru.
Bar no.	Bar babu.
Just like that day.	Kamar ma wannan rana.
I can't do that.	Ba zan iya yin hakan ba.
Fast, fast, fast.	Mai sauri, da sauri, da sauri.
She could not wait.	Ta kasa jira.
This fascinates me.	Wannan ya bani sha'awa.
We all live there.	Mu duka muna zaune a wurin.
Right to be wrong.	Dama ya zama ba daidai ba.
Here it happens.	Nan ya faru.
He failed all the time.	Ya kasa kowane lokaci.
They talked about that, of course.	Sun yi magana game da wannan, ba shakka.
And we will never.	Kuma ba za mu taba.
I want to be me	Ina son zama ni
And maybe not.	Kuma watakila ba.
Above and below.	Na sama da na kasa.
Front up.	Gaba da sama.
Let everyone know what you are doing.	Bari kowa ya san abin da kuke yi.
These things are mine.	Waɗannan abubuwa nawa ne.
Even if they did today, it would be too late.	Ko da sun yi haka yau, da an makara.
I understand now.	Na gane yanzu.
Today is the day.	Yau ce ranar.
You do not have to do anything more.	Ba sai ka kara yin komai ba.
The rest will be one year, in a year or two.	Sauran za su kasance shekaru ɗaya, a cikin shekara ɗaya ko biyu.
There is no sign.	Babu alama.
It was a time of fun.	Lokaci ne na jin daɗi.
The time has come.	Ya zo daidai lokacin.
Now is my chance.	Yanzu shine dama na.
They have never planned to conquer the world.	Ba su taɓa shirin cin nasara a duniya ba.
I don't have to say anything.	Bai kamata in ce komai ba.
For some, it was because he was so weak.	Ga wasu, saboda ya kasance mai rauni sosai.
Who said what.	Wa yace me.
The excitement was overwhelming.	Farin ciki ya yi yawa.
He does not live in it.	Ba ya zama a ciki.
God in heaven.	Allah sama.
We are amazing.	Muna da ban mamaki.
And they think that they know how good that is.	Kuma suna tunanin cewa sun san yadda hakan ke da kyau.
She has to hurry.	Dole ta yi sauri.
I boarded the train in the morning.	Na kama jirgin da safe.
Some are never seen again.	Wasu ba a sake ganin su ba.
She wants to see if she is good.	Tana son ganin ko tana da kyau.
She just sat there.	Ta dan zauna.
It will not be the second.	Ba zai zama na biyu ba.
Of course, everyone seems to be very happy.	Tabbas yana kama da kowa ya yi farin ciki sosai.
I did not drink.	Ban sha ba.
Additional equipment and funds can be purchased.	Ana iya siyan ƙarin kayan aiki da kuɗi.
You are close.	Kun zo kusa.
Now let's go.	Yanzu sai mu tafi.
I remember I was in pain, though.	Na tuna ina jin zafi, ko da yake.
Of course he would recommend them to everyone.	Tabbas zai ba da shawarar su ga kowa da kowa.
She was right.	Ta yi daidai.
But inside !!.	Amma a ciki!!.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
Let's go check.	Mu je duba.
I'm just waiting.	Ina jira kawai.
They responded quickly.	Da sauri suka amsa.
He has been married twice before.	Ya yi aure sau biyu a baya.
Maybe there is a lot of fun, easy.	Wataƙila akwai wurin jin daɗi da yawa, mai sauƙi.
Maybe there.	Wataƙila akwai.
We saw it last night.	Mun ga shi a daren jiya.
I have a way to make a little money.	Ina da hanyar samun kuɗi kaɗan.
Maybe it was the end anyway.	Watakila shi ne karshen ta wata hanya.
I, one, will not do anything with it.	Ni, ɗaya, ba zan yi wani abu da shi ba.
I have no one here.	Ba ni da kowa a nan.
He has no run.	Ba shi da gudu.
But it gradually brings trouble.	Amma yana kawo a hankali matsala.
However, it is best not to drink too much before or during.	Duk da haka, yana da kyau kada a sha da yawa kafin ko lokacin.
Take yourself back to the road.	Dauki kanku ku dawo kan hanya.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
For others, here's how it works.	Ga sauran, ga yadda yake aiki.
We'll spend the night with him.	Za mu yi dare da shi.
Close to many things.	Kusa akan abubuwa da yawa.
So he took the time to rewrite them.	Don haka ya sami lokaci ya sake rubuta su.
I knew he would.	Na san zai yi.
Hopefully, none of this will ever be a problem again.	Da fatan, babu ɗaya daga cikin wannan da zai sake zama matsala.
You have to look at things correctly.	Dole ne ku kalli abubuwa daidai.
The celebration was very enjoyable.	Bikin ya kasance mai daɗi sosai.
All is not right.	Duk bai yi daidai ba.
It feels right, right now.	Yana jin daidai, a yanzu.
And it is still interesting today.	Kuma har yanzu yana da ban sha'awa a yau.
Once a month.	Sau ɗaya kowane wata .
Now, there is only one more thing.	Yanzu, akwai ƙarin abu ɗaya kawai.
In the end he does something for me.	A ƙarshe yana yi mini wani abu.
He is being sued.	Akan yi masa kara.
But we will, in the years to come.	Amma za mu yi, a cikin shekaru masu zuwa.

You do not want to die alone.	Ba ka so ka mutu kadai.
This will be your story.	Wannan zai zama labarin ku.
Work with it.	Yi aiki da shi.
Never miss it.	Kar a taba rasa shi.
Here is the first.	A nan ne farko.
There are so many sights to see.	Akwai abubuwan gani da yawa da za a gani.

It will not be the last.	Ba zai zama na ƙarshe ba.
Give me coffee!	Ka ba ni kofi!
I don't always do that.	Ba na yin haka kullum.
It is better to just stop seeing.	Zai fi kyau a daina gani kawai.
Things are not easy to find.	Abubuwan ba su da sauƙi a samu.
No more here.	Babu kuma a nan.
You will never be able to do that.	Ba za ku taɓa samun damar yin hakan ba.
They made a mistake, and now they have corrected it.	Sun yi kuskure, kuma yanzu sun gyara shi.

Do not grieve.	Kar ka yi bakin ciki.
He can kill her honestly.	Zai iya kashe ta da gaskiya.
And it seems right.	Kuma da alama daidai ne.
It’s not a big deal if you’re right.	Ba babban aiki ba ne idan kun yi daidai.
Obviously they must be shown.	Babu shakka dole ne a nuna su.
I think that would be great.	Ina tsammanin hakan zai yi kyau sosai.
It works really well.	Yana aiki sosai.
But still it is nothing.	Amma duk da haka bata ce komai ba.
This conclusion, of course, is a mistake.	Wannan ƙarshe, ba shakka, kuskure ne.
She really knows how to drive.	Da gaske ta san tuƙi.
It has to be right in time.	Dole ne ya kasance daidai a cikin lokaci.
I'll call him.	Zan kira shi.
Their door is open.	An bude kofar su.
When it works.	Lokacin da yake aikin.
He said no.	Yace min a'a.
Sometimes that happens, of course, and that is fine.	Wani lokaci hakan yana faruwa, ba shakka, kuma hakan yana da kyau.
The future is uncertain.	Nan gaba ba ta da tabbas.
Our plan worked.	Shirin mu ya yi aiki.
So, no problem.	Don haka, babu matsala.

It is not too much to make a person cold.	Ba ya da yawa don sanya mutum sanyi.
But this, of course, is your problem.	Amma wannan, ba shakka, shine matsalar ku.
He never knew where to start.	Bai taba iya sanin inda aka fara ba.
The reason for doing so is as follows.	Dalilin yin haka shine kamar haka.
I'm not walking well.	Ba na tafiya da kyau.
This place is amazing.	Wannan wurin yana da ban mamaki.
They are close to home.	Suna kusa da gida.

There must be a better way!	Dole ne a sami hanya mafi kyau!
I have to talk to him.	Dole ne in yi magana da shi.
But that is not right.	Amma hakan ba daidai ba ne.
Nothing caught him.	Babu abin da ya kama shi.
We agree on many things.	Mun yarda game da abubuwa da yawa.
I need to learn to lose a little better.	Ina bukata in koyi rasa mafi kyau kadan.
For there is a cry.	Don akwai wani kuka.
He said it should be so.	Yace ya kamata haka.
He was not ready, he was not ready.	Bai shirya ba, bai shirya ba.
But this is not true.	Amma wannan ba gaskiya bane.
I really want to give you a chance.	Lallai na so in ba ku dama.
He said he fixed the problem, but did not explain why.	Ya ce ya gyara matsalar, amma bai bayyana dalilin da ya sa ba.
You feel everyone and everything.	Kuna jin kowa da komai.
We can sell them, later.	Za mu iya sayar da su, daga baya.
Her mind wandered.	Tunanin ta yayi mamaki.
And he cannot be killed.	Kuma ba za a iya kashe shi ba.
You can do it yourself.	Kuna iya yin shi da kanku.

We can go to lunch or dinner sometimes.	Za mu iya zuwa abincin rana ko abincin dare wani lokaci.
He killed a man once.	Ya kashe mutum sau daya.
If you must kill a person, kill him.	Idan dole ne ku kashe mutum, ku kashe shi.
Let’s never talk about money again.	Kada mu sake yin magana game da kuɗi.
I don't think she cares.	Ina ganin bata damu da komai ba.
This house is on a great location.	Wannan gidan yana kan babban wuri.
Otherwise, you will never do as you are told.	Ban da haka, ba za ku taɓa yin abin da aka faɗa muku ba.

And he is doing what will put him back.	Kuma yana yin abin da zai sa shi a baya.

Travel is not very difficult.	Tafiya ba ta da wahala sosai.
Just play the game.	Yi wasan kawai.
It was easily repaired.	An gyara shi cikin sauƙi.
It is now.	Ya zama yanzu.
This tells me that it can be done.	Wannan yana gaya mani cewa ana iya yin hakan.
Some work and some do not.	Wasu suna aiki wasu kuma ba sa aiki.
She probably did not know anyone there.	Wataƙila ba ta san kowa a wurin ba.
Tell me where you are.	Fada mani inda kuke.
We feel good today.	Mun ji dadi yau.
See here.	Duba nan.
Three are three, twelve are twelve, one is one.	Uku uku ne, sha biyu sha biyu, daya daya.
Her car also died.	Motar ta kuma ta mutu.
That should be the case.	Haka ya kamata ya kasance.
It's good for you.	Yana da kyau a gare ku.
Tell her the truth everything.	Ka gaya mata gaskiya komai.
This was the only life she had ever had.	Wannan ita ce kawai rayuwa da ta kasance.
But there is no such thing.	Amma babu irin wannan.
We run from everything.	Muna kan gudu daga komai.
No, yet how.	Ba, duk da haka ta yaya.
It's really big for him to be able to do that.	Da gaske ya yi girma a gare shi ya iya yin hakan.
When he did, something appeared above.	Lokacin da ya yi, wani abu ya bayyana a sama.
No one likes her.	Babu mai son ta.
I do not like this book.	Ba na son wannan littafin.
But you did not say.	Amma ba ku fada ba.
You died wrong.	Ka mutu ba daidai ba.
A person needs to eat well to stay healthy.	Ana buƙatar mutum ya ci da kyau don samun lafiya.
We show it all year.	Mun nuna shi duk shekara.
To talk to me from within.	Don magana da ni daga ciki.
Sorry, or maybe not.	Hakuri, ko watakila yarda.
Don't enjoy the way it is.	Kada ku ji daɗin yadda abin ya kasance.
Everything was fine in the first place.	Komai ya yi daidai da farko.
I'll get there slowly.	Zan isa can a hankali.
I want to try that today.	Ina so in gwada hakan a yau.
There must be a better way to do this.	Dole ne a sami mafi kyawun hanyar yin wannan.
However it is easy to forget this.	Duk da haka yana da sauƙi a manta da wannan.
Yet nothing is said.	Amma duk da haka ba a cewa komai.
Readers are intelligent people.	Masu karatu mutane ne masu hankali.
Surprisingly.	Abin mamaki.
He used to need money.	Ya kasance yana bukatar kudi.
It does, and it must.	Yana yi, kuma dole ne.
It is unknown at this time what he did to cause the deaths.	Har yanzu ba a san ko wanene wanda ya kashe shi ba.
I do not hear you.	Ba na jin ku.
Kids have to play outside.	Yara sai da su yi wasa a waje.
I'm sure it will be very interesting.	Na tabbata da zai kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
I could not bring myself to even try two.	Ba zan iya kawo kaina ko da gwada biyu ba.
Look outside, first.	Duba waje, da farko.
What they do, they do, but they will never do anything new.	Abin da suke yi, suna yi, amma ba za su yi wani sabon abu ba.
The first is recommended and the latter is not.	Na farko an ba da shawarar kuma na baya ba haka bane.
I think something is better when you can make it fun.	Ina tsammanin wani abu ya fi kyau lokacin da za ku iya sanya shi jin daɗi.
If he can.	Idan zai iya.
Only money.	Kudi ne kawai.
Don't worry, though.	Kada ku damu, ko da yake.
Anyone can recognize it.	Kowa na iya gane shi.
Let's go outside.	Mu fito waje.
I think that would make a great film.	Ina tsammanin hakan zai yi babban fim.
I like this.	Ina son wannan.
I hope it goes well.	Ina fatan zai tafi lafiya.
I want you to know that.	Ina so ku san hakan.
In this, there will be a lot.	A cikin wannan, za a yi da yawa.
Do not tell the person who told you.	Kada ka gaya wa wanda ya gaya maka.
They have seen people recover after using them.	Sun ga mutane suna samun lafiya bayan amfani da su.
For others, it may tell you something you have already suspected.	Ga wasu, yana iya gaya muku wani abu da kuka riga kuka yi zargin.
I hate that you're not here.	Na ƙi cewa ba ku nan.
Anyone can do any job.	Kowane mutum na iya yin kowane aiki.
It will be raining tomorrow.	Za a yi ruwan sama gobe.
You can find it here.	Kuna iya samun shi a nan.
With it they grew up.	Da ita suka girma.
This is going to be very healthy.	Wannan zai zama lafiya sosai.
We need to get somewhere quickly.	Muna bukatar mu isa wani wuri da sauri.
After that, the work can be added in the future.	Bayan haka, ana iya ƙara aikin a nan gaba.
He knew it would not be easy.	Ya san ba zai yi sauƙi ba.
I like that.	Ina son hakan.
If you know what you are doing and why, it is good.	Idan kun san abin da kuke yi kuma me yasa, yana da kyau.
But if he takes it, she kills him.	Amma idan ya dauka, sai ta kashe shi.
He is alive, as we know.	Yana da rai, kamar yadda muka sani.
You will find many other interesting things.	Za ku gano wasu abubuwa masu ban sha'awa da yawa.
He was arrested by the police.	'Yan sanda sun kama shi.
Or even one run.	Ko ma gudu daya.
I can't take you anymore.	Ba zan iya ɗaukar ku kuma.
Do not walk home at night.	Kada ku yi tafiya gida da dare.
We continued.	Muka ci gaba.
We know very little about him.	Mun san kadan game da shi.
He started walking.	Ya fara tafiya.
He reads well and often helps us.	Yana karatu da kyau kuma sau da yawa yana taimaka mana.
He helped me.	Sai ya taimake ni.
There is so much food to eat!	Akwai abinci da yawa da za a ci!
It’s working now, which is worth it.	Yana da aiki yanzu, wanda ya dace.
We should not.	Bai kamata mu ba.
My kids can’t just go outside and play here.	Yara na ba za su iya fita waje kawai su yi wasa a nan ba.
And give a hand in it.	Kuma a ba da hannu a ciki.
Here it has no function.	A nan ba shi da wani aiki.
They don't like that.	Ba su son wannan.
The same thing happens here, anytime.	Haka ke faruwa a nan, kowane lokaci.
I think so now.	Ina ganin haka yanzu.
But not good.	Amma ba kyau.
You can be whatever you want.	Kuna iya zama duk abin da kuke so.
I use it almost once a week.	Ina amfani da shi kusan sau ɗaya a mako.
And nothing can reach that.	Kuma babu wani abu da zai iya kai wannan.
Of course, that is not true.	Tabbas, ba gaskiya bane.
It continues and works again.	Yana ci gaba kuma yana aiki kuma.
So far we have not succeeded.	Ya zuwa yanzu ba mu yi nasara ba.
That worked.	Haka ya yi aiki.
For me, they were.	Saboda ni, sun kasance.
They are just there.	Suna can kawai.
He did not know that no one would arrest him.	Bai san cewa babu wanda zai kama shi ba.
They are coming home to pass.	Suna zuwa gida su wuce.
At home and at work and play.	A gida da wurin aiki da wasa.
I think this is it.	Ina tsammanin wannan shine.
We will never be able to.	Ba za mu taba iya ba.
For many people, this is the time to wait.	Ga mutane da yawa, wannan shine lokacin da suke jira.
Look up in your name book.	Nemi a littafin sunan ku.
She replied thinking of releasing him.	Ta amsa tana tunanin sake shi.
This will be even greater.	Wannan zai fi girma.
A little higher.	Sama kadan.
Well, not great.	Da kyau, ba mai girma ba.
She's sure it won't be long.	Ta tabbata ba zai dade ba.
And they are right.	Kuma sun yi gaskiya.

They knew what he was doing.	Sun san abin da ya yi.
Not even mine, really.	Ba ma nawa bane, da gaske.
I agree with everything she said.	Na yarda da duk abin da ta fada.
Write like there is no tomorrow.	Rubuta kamar babu gobe.
But nothing was done.	Amma ba a yi komai ba.
I feel what other people are feeling.	Ina jin abin da sauran mutane ke ji.
The process is simple.	Hanyar yana da sauƙi.
I missed the moment.	Na rasa lokacin.
Now he has no place here because of her.	Yanzu ba shi da wuri a nan saboda ita.
It is just what you should do.	Shi ne kawai abin da ya kamata ku yi.
I have nowhere to live.	Babu inda zan zauna.
Of course they are talking.	Tabbas suna magana.
And it goes into everything.	Kuma yana shiga komai.
Anything can be.	Duk abin da zai iya zama.
So please give me an idea.	Don haka don Allah a ba ni tunani.
And everyone wanted that feeling.	Kuma kowa ya so wannan jin.
More than one child was killed.	An kashe yara fiye da daya.
Interesting.	Ban sha'awa.
It is difficult to drink from the stomach.	Da wuya a sha daga ciki.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Yayi kama da gudu.
He has no answer.	Ba shi da amsa.
You should go inside.	Ya kamata ku shiga cikin gida.
It is difficult to know what is better.	Yana da wuya a san abin da ya fi kyau.
It changes you.	Yana canza ku.
We know where we stand on that.	Mun san inda muka tsaya akan hakan.
I am working on development.	Ni aiki ne a ci gaba.
Come, spend many years with him.	Ka zo, ka yi shekaru da yawa tare da shi.
We know that we both live here.	Mun san cewa mu biyu suna zaune a nan.
All the time honest.	Duk lokacin gaskiya.
The story does not end here.	Labarin bai kare a nan ba.
This article is not about them.	Wannan labarin ba game da su bane.
At first, we thought it would not work.	Da farko, mun yi tunanin ba zai yi aiki ba.
I feel like we are in the same boat.	Ina jin kamar muna cikin jirgin ruwa guda.
I could not let myself fall asleep.	Ba zan iya barin kaina in yi barci ba.
She was exactly what you thought.	Ta kasance daidai abin da kuke tunani.
The world covered me.	Duniya ta rufe ni.
So help them.	Don haka ku taimake su.
They said no and he started killing people.	Suka ce a'a sai ya fara kashe mutane.
Wait for it to go.	Jira ya tafi.
Including us who prepared.	Har da mu da muka shirya.
They never had access.	Ba su taba samun dama ba.
You can have that kind of person.	Kuna iya samun irin wannan, mutum.
I heard a lot about that.	Na ji da yawa game da wannan.
Only you can do that.	Kai kaɗai ne za ka iya yin hakan.
This food will leave you wanting more.	Wannan abincin zai bar ku kuna son ƙarin.
It's a great place.	Babban wuri ne.
We agreed to talk again in the morning.	Mun yarda mu sake magana da safe.
Do you have a good day?	Kuna da rana mai kyau?
That thought was the first.	Wannan tunanin ya kasance na farko.
She sat right.	Ta zauna daidai.
But not here or now.	Amma ba a nan ko yanzu ba.
It is good to see this approach taken.	Yana da kyau ganin an ɗauki wannan hanya.
But we fear it will.	Amma muna tsoron zai yi.
This is the kind of heat.	Wannan irin zafi ne.
You know how these things work.	Kun san yadda waɗannan abubuwa ke aiki.
You can talk to her at any time.	Kuna iya magana da ita a kowane lokaci.
I took mine with me.	Na dauki nawa tare da ni.
He will buy the book.	Zai sayi littafin.
It doesn't work, for anyone.	Ba ya aiki, ga wani.
But we did not see how it was.	Amma ba mu ga yadda abin yake ba.
Mark me carefully.	Yi min alama a hankali.
So a lot of people got involved.	Don haka mutane da yawa sun shiga ciki.
I have always wanted to play this game.	Na dade ina son buga wannan wasan.
I am not used to this kind of thing.	Ban saba da irin wannan abu ba.
And well, one day, it happened.	Kuma da kyau, wata rana, ya faru.
We have some time to prepare accordingly.	Muna da ɗan lokaci don shirya yadda ya kamata.
But that is good.	Amma hakan yayi kyau.
The problem is they don’t.	Matsalar ita ce ba su da.
No one has ever done that.	Babu wanda ya taɓa yin haka.
It may take some time.	Yana iya ɗaukar lokaci.
You will know the things they will not do.	Za ku san abubuwan da ba za su yi ba.
Let the oil boil.	Bari mai yayi zafi.
He didn't seem to get it.	Da alama bai samu ba.
He lifted it for a moment.	Ya d'aga shi na d'an lokaci.
He is a winner.	Shi ne mai nasara.
It should not be.	Bai kamata ya kasance ba.
If you buy now.	Idan kun saya yanzu.
And the boy was always nice.	Kuma yaro ya kasance yana da kyau.
The house is beautiful.	Gidan ya yi kyau.
I always forget something.	Kullum ina manta wani abu.
We don’t have what others want but we don’t have it.	Ba mu da abin da wasu ke so amma ba mu da shi.
Learn these tools.	Koyi waɗannan kayan aikin.
She prefers us.	Ta fi so mana.
You can stay home with us.	Kuna iya zama a gida tare da mu.
They know what they want and where to get it.	Sun san abin da suke so da kuma inda za su samu.
What we missed.	Me muka rasa.
The former are much more numerous than the latter.	Na farko sun fi na baya yawa yawa.
There is nothing more frightening.	Babu wani abu da ya fi tsoro.
Let's go.	Mu shiga.
I was surprised the police let them talk they didn’t care.	Na yi mamaki 'yan sanda sun bar su su yi magana ba su kula ba.
Do not do this.	Kar ku yi wannan.
This is a very sad book.	Wannan littafin bakin ciki ne sosai.
Take water before eating.	Ɗauki ruwa kafin cin abinci.
I will tell you about it later.	Zan gaya muku game da shi a gaba.
It's easy to laugh.	Yana da sauƙi a yi dariya.
Things that will not work in the end.	Abubuwan da ba za su yi aiki a ƙarshe ba.
Maybe she didn't feel well.	Watakila bai ji ta da kyau ba.
Almost how much she got.	Kusan nawa ne ta samu.
Maybe more will come in the future.	Wataƙila ƙarin zai zo nan gaba.
Maybe a few are drinking the last one.	Wataƙila wasu kaɗan suna shan na ƙarshe.
I can't stay here with you.	Ba zan iya zama a nan tare da ku ba.
It's just sitting.	Zaune ne kawai.
Don't worry.	Kada ku damu.
We are here.	Muna nan.
Life is so good !.	Rayuwa tana da kyau sosai!.
We really enjoyed it.	Mun ji daɗi sosai.
The water level is too high.	Ruwan ruwa ya yi yawa.
Nothing will be found now.	Ba za a sami komai ba yanzu.
So we have to figure out how to kill this.	Don haka dole ne mu gano yadda za mu kashe wannan.
Well, you have to eat well.	Da kyau, dole ne ku ci da kyau.
I can't believe it.	Ba zan iya yarda da shi ba.
You get more than that.	Ka samu fiye da shi.
It is so unusual.	Sabon abu ne don haka.
I was given a difficult job.	An ba ni aiki mai wahala.
You are a real person.	Irin ku ne na gaske.
It's just good.	Yayi kyau kawai.
He has been in this role ever since.	Ya kasance a cikin wannan aikin tun daga lokacin.
They do not have to see it.	Ba sai sun ga haka ba.
They just did well.	Sun yi kyau kawai.
Hopefully it will stay that way.	Da fatan zai tsaya haka.
I think it’s the best thing in the world.	Ina tsammanin abu ne mafi kyau a duniya.
I know just what you need.	Na san kawai abin da kuke bukata.
But maybe that's fine.	Amma watakila hakan yayi kyau.

They are very careful.	Sun yi hankali sosai.

Maybe he did too.	Wataƙila shi ma ya yi.
No one will.	Babu wanda zai yi.
The room is very loud now.	Dakin yayi kara sosai yanzu.
It's very difficult.	Yana da wuya sosai.
They were interested in that.	Sun kasance masu sha'awar hakan.
They are afraid of the police.	Suna tsoron 'yan sanda.
Heaven above you.	Sama sama da kai.
He waited until he was pregnant before looking.	Ya jira har yana ciki kafin ya duba.
Carefully cut.	A hankali yanke.
You took a chance.	Kun dauki dama.
It started to rain.	Nan take aka fara ruwan sama.
And you.	Kuma ka.
Start with this, and just this.	Fara da wannan, kuma kawai wannan.
I can't explain it.	Ba zan iya bayyana shi ba.
Or to protect them.	Ko don kare su.
Stop it.	Ku daina.
When the truth comes out he will understand.	Idan gaskiya ta fito zai gane.
Everyone must work from this.	Dole ne kowa ya yi aiki daga wannan.
I'm not married, you know.	Ba ni da aure, ka sani.
I'm sure in a month or two you will be out.	Na tabbata nan da wata daya ko biyu za ku fita.
I think it's happening.	Ina tsammanin yana faruwa.
But this is the ultimate work of the wise.	Amma wannan shine aikin ƙarshe na masu hankali.
Think about your work.	Yi tunani akan aikin ku.
I would not like.	Ba zan so ba.
That's the way it is.	Haka ake yi.
I opened the front door.	Na bude kofar gida.
It just can’t be true.	Kawai ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
Anyone who touches it will answer me.	Duk wanda ya taba shi zai amsa mini.
She shouldn’t have known that but she did, of course.	Bai kamata ta san haka ba amma ta yi, ba shakka.
Some are convinced.	Wasu sun tabbata.
I know what is right and true.	Na san abin da yake daidai da gaskiya.
You can see him looking for them.	Kuna iya ganin shi yana neman su.
The man was not feeling well.	Mutumin bai ji dadi ba.
Worked for the best.	An yi aiki don mafi kyau.
About the child.	Game da yaro.
This method can be used for travel.	Ana iya amfani da wannan hanyar don tafiya.
I looked like him.	Na yi kama da shi.
I know for sure.	Na san tabbas tabbas.
This is one for me.	Wannan daya ne a gare ni.
You can decide whether to wear them or not.	Kuna iya yanke shawarar ko za ku saka su ko a'a.
After a year of using it, it was really good.	Bayan shekara guda na amfani da shi, yana da kyau sosai.
Not very happy.	Ba farin ciki sosai.
It seems to be in pain.	Da alama yana jin zafi.
Remember when it comes to you.	Ku tuna idan ya zo muku.
He will come.	Zai zo.
She accepted him when he said he loved her.	Ta yarda da shi lokacin da ya ce yana son shi.
Nothing else worked.	Babu wani abu kuma da ya yi aiki.
I live at home.	Ina zaune a gida.
New home.	Sabon gida.
However, the latter is very weak.	Duk da haka, na karshen yana da rauni sosai.
I want to say we know what to do.	Ina so in ce mun san abin da za mu yi.
In fact he is not there.	A gaskiya ba ya nan.
Everything is secondary.	Komai na biyu ne.
And they did it the following year, and a year later.	Kuma suka yi shi a shekara ta gaba, da kuma shekara bayan haka.
It comes very quickly.	Ya zo da sauri da sauri.
He will go to school.	Zai tafi makaranta.
She felt that everything had been cut for her.	Ta ji an yanke mata komai.
What a wonderful feeling.	Abin da ban mamaki ji.
Stop doing or thinking what you do not like, and move on.	Ka daina yin ko tunanin abin da ba ka so, kuma ka ci gaba.
We will show this below.	Za mu nuna wannan a kasa.
There were many people coming to board the ark.	Akwai mutane da yawa da suka zo shiga jirgin.
Do this again, and they can kill you!	Yi wannan kuma, kuma suna iya kashe ku!
You want to stay in the house.	Kuna so ku zauna a gidan.
We are good.	Muna da kyau.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
No, it can not happen.	A'a, ba zai iya faruwa ba.
Whatever happens now, he still wants to get out.	Duk abin da ya faru a yanzu, har yanzu yana son fita.
I do not have time.	Ba ni da lokaci.
I do not feel this.	Ba na jin wannan.
Everyone is fine with it.	Kowa yana da kyau tare da shi.
Things can be good.	Abubuwa na iya zama masu kyau.
It is a tool that is not commonly used.	Kayan aiki ne da ba ya yawan amfani da shi.
At arm's length.	A tsawon hannu.
I figured out how to fix it.	Na gano yadda zan gyara shi.
I never knew what she would do with it.	Ban taba sanin me za ta yi da shi ba.
And change course.	Kuma canza hanya.
Something has to be done about it, too.	Dole ne a yi wani abu game da hakan, ma.
We will never get out of here.	Ba za mu taba samun fita daga nan ba.
But, you know?	Amma, ka sani?
And we are still happy together.	Kuma har yanzu muna cikin farin ciki tare.
She is not even serious.	Ita ba ma da gaske ba ce.
I send them closed.	Ina aika su a rufe.
I can not be late.	Ba zan iya makara ba.
Obviously, this is not true.	Babu shakka, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Inside there is a greater surprise.	A ciki akwai wani abin mamaki mafi girma.
Focus on what is inside you.	Mai da hankali kan abin da yake cikin ku.
Sorry you don't care.	Yi hakuri ba ka damu da shi ba.
I was close enough to touch it.	Na kusa isa in taba shi.
There are so many things to admire.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa don sha'awar shi.
I am back.	Na dawo.
I'm sure this is.	Na tabbata wannan shine.
I'll be fine with it.	Zan yi lafiya da shi.
You think you know everything about them.	Kuna tsammanin kun san komai game da su.
Prepare food for yourself.	Yi wa kanku abinci.
Some people refuse to travel by plane.	Wasu mutane sun ƙi tafiya ta jirgin sama.
I wondered if he was home for this celebration.	Na yi tunanin ko ya kasance gida don wannan bikin.
They did things to him.	Sun yi masa abubuwa.
Look at sleep.	Kalli barci.
This should be fine.	Wannan yakamata ya zama lafiya.
You have learned not to show it.	Kun koyi kada ku nuna shi.
I tried something with this but it didn't work.	Na gwada wani abu da wannan amma ba ya aiki.
But it is not enough.	Amma bai isa ba.
This coffee is great.	Wannan kofi yana da kyau.
You can only imagine.	Kuna iya tunanin kawai.
Something went wrong there.	Wani abu ya ji ba daidai ba a can.
Be careful about it.	Yi hankali game da shi.
Before we know about this.	Kafin mu san game da wannan.
They are accustomed to such things.	Sun saba da irin waɗannan abubuwa.
I thought you were busy.	Na dauka kana bakin aiki.
Get up, get up.	Tashi, tashi.
They should know two things.	Su sani guda biyu ne.
Yet their hearing filled her with joy.	Amma duk da haka jin su ya cika ta da farin ciki.
Tomorrow is the last day here.	Gobe ​​ita ce rana ta ƙarshe a nan.
Always up.	Kullum sai sama.
You must do your best next time.	Dole ne ku yi mafi kyau lokaci na gaba.
He is behind her.	Yana bayan ta.
You will not understand.	Ba za ku gane ba.
Write down the things you see.	Rubuta abubuwan da kuke gani.
I was in the house, but the others did not know.	Ina cikin gidan, amma sauran ba su sani ba.
He could not do that.	Ya kasa yin hakan.
I do not see it.	Ban ga haka ba.
We hope you understand.	Muna fatan kun gane.
I have one thing over another.	Ina da wani abu akan wani.
We must look to the future.	Dole ne mu duba ga nan gaba.
Otherwise, he will eventually kill her.	Idan ba haka ba, a ƙarshe zai kashe ta.
You can leave at any time if you do not feel comfortable.	Kuna iya barin kowane lokaci idan ba ku ji daɗi ba.
But he could not run.	Amma ya kasa gudu.
He was worried that the right thing to do.	Ya damu cewa abin da ya dace ya yi.
She is married and has two children.	Ta yi aure kuma tana da ‘ya’ya biyu.
But he immediately realized what was happening.	Amma nan da nan ya gane abin da ke faruwa.
However, it is a difficult journey.	Duk da haka, yana da wuya tafiya.
It's always fast.	Kullum cikin sauri take.
And they are amazing.	Kuma suna da ban mamaki.
You will have a great time with them !.	Za ku ji daɗi sosai tare da su!.
They think that's when it happened.	Suna tsammanin a lokacin ne abin ya faru.
This would prove to be a big mistake.	Wannan zai tabbatar da zama babban kuskure .
He didn't care much.	Bai damu da yawa ba.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai .
And it tells us why they are so hard to find.	Kuma ya gaya mana dalilin da ya sa suka yi wuya a samu.
The world would be better without you.	Duniya zata fi kyau ba tare da kai ba.
It makes you think though.	Yana sa ku tunani ko da yake.
So they make more money.	Don haka suna samun ƙarin kuɗi.
I missed something.	Na rasa wani abu.
We want to succeed.	Muna so mu yi nasara.
But she must be working right now.	Amma tabbas tana bakin aiki a yanzu.
Someone may cover you.	Wani zai iya rufe maka.
And the boy came out well.	Kuma yaro ta fito da kyau.
I have never seen him today.	Ban taba ganin sa ba a yau.
So every moment is the same every time.	Don haka kowane lokaci daidai yake da kowane lokaci.
I will give you everything.	Zan baka komai.
Even if that is true, it will not help much.	Ko da hakan gaskiya ne, ba zai taimaka da yawa ba.
I tried to make myself sick, and failed.	Na yi ƙoƙarin sanya kaina rashin lafiya, kuma na kasa.
The first happened here.	Na farko ya faru a nan.
They give us hope.	Suna ba mu fata.
People are trying to write it.	Mutane suna ƙoƙarin rubuta shi.
She has been there a year now.	Ta kasance a can shekara guda yanzu.
He knows he's feeling really good right now.	Ya san cewa yana jin daɗi sosai a yanzu.
It will not help you.	Ba zai taimake ku ba.
Can you give it to me?	Za a iya ba ni
You got that opportunity, you won.	Kun sami wannan dama, kun ci nasara.
He enjoyed being able to talk to someone.	Ya ji daɗin iya magana da wani.
What you want.	Abin da kuke so.
Not very tasty.	Ba dadi sosai.
He would not mind.	Ba zai damu ba.
It's better now.	Ya fi kyau yanzu.
I'm trying to do the right thing.	Ina ƙoƙarin yin abin da yake daidai.
Hopefully this is just me.	Da fatan wannan ni ne kawai.
They are not very good.	Ba su da kyau sosai.
Others.	Wasu kuma.
It was a good time.	Lokaci ne mai kyau.
Two days.	Kwana biyu.
It's hard, it's hard.	Yana da wuya, yana da wuya.
But not only that.	Amma ba haka kawai ba.
I’m not really here to prove anything.	Ba ni da gaske a nan don tabbatar da wani abu.
I enjoy this and we are interested here.	Ina jin daɗin wannan kuma muna da sha'awa a nan.
It really is a good place.	Da gaske wuri ne mai kyau.
No one has ever thought of doing that, either.	Ba wanda ya taɓa tunanin yin hakan a baya, ko.
That's not what I want.	Ba haka nake so ba.
Do not try to change the feeling.	Kada ku yi ƙoƙarin canza ji.
No one put him there or anyone knew he was there.	Ba wanda ya sanya shi a wurin ko wanda ya san yana can.
Maybe it’s not as good as it looks.	Wataƙila ba shi da kyau kamar yadda yake gani.
Hurry up kids, or we are late to school!	Yi sauri yara, ko mu makara zuwa makaranta!
It was very big for me at the time.	Ya yi mini girma sosai a lokacin.
He kept amazed her.	Ya yi ta ba ta mamaki.
This is nothing.	Wannan ba komai ba ne.
We're sorry.	Mu yi hakuri.
I think it makes sense.	Ina tsammanin yana da hankali.
Little did he ever make sense.	Kadan ya taɓa yin hankali.
Things are not easy for me right now.	Abubuwa ba su da sauƙi a gare ni yanzu.
He enjoyed working there.	Ya ji daɗin yin aiki a wurin.
When that failed, he joined.	Lokacin da hakan ya kasa, sai ya shiga.
Is this the way we have traveled in the past?	Wannan hanya ce da muka yi tafiya a baya?
Do you have high hopes for the future?	Kuna da kyakkyawan fata game da gaba?
See if this is still true.	Duba ko wannan har yanzu gaskiya ne.
And that’s why he didn’t get a chance.	Kuma wannan shine dalilin da ya sa bai samu dama ba.
How do you close this white house every day.	Ya kuke rufe wannan farin gida kowace rana.
I know some are looking for that.	Na san wasu suna neman hakan.
Now he can think.	Yanzu ya iya tunani.
Things are not going well.	Abubuwa ba su yi kyau ba.
Suddenly, two men were walking out of the house.	Sai ga mutane biyu suna fita daga gidan tana shiga.
Look out!	Yi hankali!
I can't go out.	Ba zan iya fita ba.
The knowledge will return.	Da sanin zai dawo.
There is nothing sensible about it.	Babu wani abu mai hankali game da shi.
I said I must never think again.	Na ce tabbas ban sake yin tunani ba.
You will see that he is right.	Lallai za ka ga ya yi gaskiya.
It is what things are made of.	Shi ne abin da ake yin abubuwa.
Go love a child.	Tafi son yaro.
She did me really well.	Ta yi min kyau sosai.
I told him the truth.	Na gaya masa gaskiya.
She almost saw that.	Da ta kusa ganin haka.
But she will not cry.	Amma ba za ta yi kuka ba.
We will be back!	Za mu dawo!
Just don’t try it.	Kawai kar a gwada shi.
Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.	Wataƙila ba zai zama mummunan ba.
Maybe you too.	Wataƙila za ku ma.
No, that is not fair.	A'a, hakan bai dace ba.
Adding water to coffee makes it a beverage, of course.	Ƙara ruwa zuwa kofi yana sa ya zama abin sha, ba shakka.
He will not go.	Ba zai tafi ba.
Then there is food.	Sai ga abinci.
I know exactly where everyone lives and where they sleep.	Na san ainihin inda kowa yake zaune da kuma inda suke kwana.
Next, next.	Gaba, gaba.
Make it interesting.	Sanya shi mai ban sha'awa.
I started talking.	Na fara yin magana.
who he or she.	wanda shi ko ita.
You are funny.	Kai abin ban dariya ne.
I prefer to have two players and one.	Na fi son samun 'yan wasa biyu da daya.
Probably my favorite place in the world.	Wataƙila shine wurin da na fi so a duniya.
But since then things have changed dramatically.	Amma tun daga lokacin abubuwa sun canza sosai.
Today things have changed.	Yau abin ya canza.
If things were cool there, we would know about it.	Idan abubuwa sun yi sanyi a can, za mu san game da shi.
We have to go back and get it.	Dole ne mu koma mu samu.
He was really funny.	Ya kasance mai ban dariya da gaske.
I have been waiting to do so.	Na dade ina jiran yin haka.
That turned out to be a really good thing.	Wannan ya zama abu mai kyau sosai.
I can't figure out why it doesn't work.	Ba zan iya gano dalilin da ya sa ba ya aiki.
He has to show he really is.	Dole ne ya nuna yana da gaske.
It's a nice day.	Ranar ta yi kyau.
No arrests have been made.	Ba a taba kama kowa ba.
This is exactly what we want.	Wannan shi ne ainihin abin da muke so.
Not too hot, not too cold.	Ba zafi sosai, ba sanyi ba ne.
Don't worry, you can re-enter if necessary.	Kada ku damu, za ku iya sake shiga ciki idan ya zama dole.
You stand for what is right.	Kun tsaya kan abin da yake daidai.
No, fear not.	A'a, tsoro, a'a.
This train is always on time.	Wannan jirgin kasa koyaushe yana kan lokaci.
They need you more than they need this.	Suna buƙatar ku fiye da buƙatar wannan .
It's like at home.	Kamar a gida ne.
He is a wonderful man.	Mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
That would not be right.	Hakan ba zai yi daidai ba.
I don't think she can say the same.	Bata tunanin zata iya fada daya.
It all happened.	Duk ya faru.
When he returned he did not do well.	Lokacin da ya dawo bai yi kyau ba.
It will be a working day.	Zai zama ranar aiki.
Drink coffee well.	An sha kofi da kyau.
This is it! 	Wannan shi ne!
Can't wait to try it out.	Ba za a iya jira don gwada shi ba.
He cannot see very well.	Ba ya iya ganin abubuwa sosai.
The school teacher is weak, so it must be taken care of carefully.	Malamin makaranta yana da rauni, don haka dole ne a kula da shi a hankali.
But she has already heard.	Amma ta riga ta ji.
He spoke slowly.	Ya fad'a a hankali.
I tell you it is one.	Ina gaya muku shi daya ne.
Everything as described.	Komai kamar yadda aka bayyana.
She knew the car.	Ta san motar.
She said now let's talk.	Sai ta ce yanzu sai mu yi magana.
And nothing goes in anymore.	Kuma babu abin da ke shiga kuma.
Have another weekend.	Yi wani karshen mako.
He wanted her with him.	Ya so ta tare da shi.
All of this is like years for me.	Duk wannan kamar shekaru ne a gare ni.
Place you now.	Sanya ku a yanzu.
This is something new and unusual.	Wannan wani sabon abu ne da ba a saba gani ba.
It has been there, hard to see for years.	A can ya kasance, da wuya a gani tsawon shekaru.
This is not going to be easy or comfortable.	Wannan ba zai zama mai sauƙi ko dadi ba.
What about it.	Menene game da shi.
He was worried there.	Ya damu a can.
You better hope so.	Gara ku yi fatan haka.
Whether we like it or not.	Ko muna so ko ba a so.
It will be so here.	Zai zama haka a nan.
I do not agree with that.	Ban yarda da hakan ba.
He drank a lot.	Ya sha da yawa.
We grew up together once.	Mun sake girma tare sau ɗaya.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba haka yake faruwa ba.
It's exciting.	Abin farin ciki ne.
So let me think a little bit here.	Don haka bari in dan yi tunani a nan.
When he returned, it was too late.	Da ya dawo ya makara.
Something like this and this.	Wani abu kamar wannan da wannan.
They must leave me, whether they like it or not.	Dole ne su bar ni, ko sun so ko ba sa so.
When she had finished speaking, it was too late.	Da ta gama gama fad'a, sai ya makara.
The world will know what happened.	Duniya za ta san abin da ya faru.
Let's not talk about that.	Kada mu yi magana game da wannan.
Give me a drink.	Bani wani abin sha.
First look and see.	Da farko ku duba ku gani.
I do not like that.	Ba na son hakan.
Really ???, what are they doing to you ???.	Da gaske ???, me suke yi muku???.
Just lie more.	Kara karya kawai.
Something will be very fishy.	Wani abu zai zama mai kifi sosai.
I hope this is useful.	Ina fatan wannan yana da amfani.
But he always got up.	Amma ya tashi kullum.
They are amazing and sad.	Suna da ban mamaki da bakin ciki.
Take a moment to read about it here.	Ɗauki ɗan lokaci don karanta game da shi a nan.
They arrived at the bus station.	Sun isa tashar bas.
Leave things as they are.	Bar abubuwa yadda suke.
It's not a game.	Ba wasa ba.
The game is for you.	Wasan yayi muku.
Let's stay home.	Mu tsaya a gida.
We are only a few years old.	Mu ‘yan shekaru ne kawai.
They are my skin.	Su ne fata na.
Anyone who wants to.	Duk wanda yake so.
I learned a lot from him.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa daga gare shi.
It's cool, nice.	Yana da sanyi, mai kyau.
She stopped eating.	Ta daina cin abinci.
In fact, it felt like an open house.	A gaskiya ma, ya ji kamar bude gida.
Or through her.	Ko ta hanyar ta.
If it can be of any help.	Idan yana iya zama na kowane taimako.
I have to do something.	Dole ne in yi wani abu.
But, this is nothing new.	Amma, wannan ba sabon abu ba ne.
I would think.	Zan yi tunanin.
But he can wait.	Amma yana iya jira.
Must be bought together to live together.	Dole ne a saya tare don zama tare.
I think there is one thing.	Ina tsammanin akwai abu daya.
The day she disappeared.	Ranar da ta bata.
And so on.	Kuma haka nan.
You don't hate it.	Ba ka ƙi shi ba.
But it is known to exist.	Amma an san akwai.
We tried it and tried it.	Mun gwada mun gwada kuma mun gwada.
Kill him!	Kashe shi!
That would be ridiculous.	Wannan zai zama abin dariya.
I don't know how she does it.	Ban san yadda take yi ba.
I want to buy a house	Ina so in sayi gida
He went out on the road.	Ya fita a hanya.
The same thing happens every year.	Haka abin yake a kowace shekara.
We know how to get back.	Mun san yadda za mu dawo.
And and again.	Kuma da kuma.
The car on the car sped off.	Motar da ke kan motar ta tashi.
It worked perfectly and worked fast.	Ya yi aiki gaba ɗaya kuma yayi aiki da sauri.
It dies easy to use and works very well.	Ya mutu mai sauƙi don amfani kuma yana aiki sosai.
But no, you know, not often.	Amma ba, ka sani, ba sau da yawa.
But they did not stop there.	Amma ba su tsaya nan ba.
I can't let him run.	Ba zan iya yarda ya gudu ba.
You may hate it.	Kuna iya ƙi shi.
Life changed after that.	Rayuwa ta canza bayan haka.
I run every day.	Ina gudu kowace rana.
This is the third.	Na uku kenan.
Move to a new location.	Tafiya zuwa sabon wuri.
I got out of it.	Na fita daga ciki.
She looked at the doctor.	Ta kalli likitan.
You can not live with this feeling.	Ba za ku iya rayuwa tare da wannan jin ba.
Did you hear that?	Kun ji haka?
I want to work on it.	Ina son yin aiki a kai.
But she has an amazing idea.	Amma tana da tunani na ban mamaki.
Is that even right.	Shin ma daidai ne.
Things have to change, and they will.	Dole ne abubuwa su canza, kuma za su yi.
There are many who do not know.	Akwai da yawa da ba ta sani ba.
Be careful what you eat.	Yi hankali da abin da kuke ci.
Probably by a way she never knew.	Tabbas ta hanyar da bata taba sani ba.
I just have to do it.	Ya kamata in yi shi kawai.
You and I are just now.	Ni da kai ne kawai yanzu.
We can't say anything.	Ba za mu iya cewa komai ba.
It's better.	Ya fi.
I grew up fast.	Na girma cikin sauri.
I use it a lot.	Ina amfani da shi sosai.
Do whatever you want there.	Yi duk abin da kuke so a can.
But he did not ask me about it.	Amma bai tambaye ni game da hakan ba.
They still haven't.	Har yanzu ba su yi ba.
I will be happy to help you today.	Zan yi farin cikin taimaka muku a yau.
Is anyone there?	Akwai kowa a wurin?
The day is still missing.	Har yanzu ba a rasa ranar ba.
He is a human being.	Mutum ne.
You will get your money in it.	Za ku sami kuɗin ku a ciki.
I said no.	Na ce ba haka ba ne.
They have been changed.	An canza su.
There are many opportunities.	Akwai dama da dama.
He has to do it himself.	Dole ne ya yi shi da kansa.
I do not want to see this.	Ba na son ganin wannan.
And boy, is there a lot.	Kuma yaro, akwai mai yawa.
Please, log in.	Don Allah, shiga ciki.
She knew he was dead.	Ta san ya mutu.
See you tomorrow again.	Sai gobe kuma.

But we have to get out of here.	Amma dole mu fita daga nan.
You certainly should not do that.	Lallai bai kamata ku yi hakan ba.
But he was fine.	Amma ya kasance lafiya.
I have to get out of here.	Dole ne in fita daga nan.
However they can leave us.	Duk da haka suna iya barin mu.
I think that's how it should be done.	Na dauka haka ne ya kamata a yi.
He is still studying.	Har yanzu yana karatu.
These are.	Waɗannan su ne.
Or maybe it's just a hobby.	Ko watakila sha'awa ce kawai.
She was with me, even when she was not there.	Ta kasance tare da ni, ko da ba ta nan.
She closed her door with her.	Ta rufe kofar ta tare ta.
And maybe they did.	Kuma watakila sun yi.
She may be accustomed to this place.	Za ta iya saba da wannan wurin.
Maybe this is the first time.	Wataƙila hakan shine karo na farko.
Maybe a little too much.	Wataƙila ya ɗan yi yawa.
She will get that.	Za ta samu haka.
He will know if she has.	Zai sani ko tana da.
He raised you.	Ya daga kai.
I know you.	Na san ku.
There is nothing new in this.	Babu wani sabon abu a cikin wannan.
Let's do this.	Mu yi wannan.
He plays very funny.	Yana wasa da ban dariya sosai.
But, for now.	Amma, a yanzu.
Even now he will not recognize me.	Yanzu ma ba zai gane ni ba.
I told you what happened.	Na gaya muku abin da ya faru.
Everything we can think of.	Duk abin da za mu iya tunani.
This is the real story.	Wannan shine ainihin labarin.
You look nice.	Kun yi kyau.
Not to mention, though.	Kada a ce ba, ko da yake.
He says.	Yana fada.
You need to travel.	Kuna buƙatar tafiya.
I want you to tell me everything.	Ina so ka gaya mani komai.
The same goes for tomorrow.	Haka ma gobe.
There will be an attempt on the next trip.	Za a yi wani ƙoƙari a tafiya ta gaba.
Everything has its time and place.	Komai yana da lokaci da wuri.
Or something about that.	Ko wani abu a kan haka.
It's late.	Lokaci ya wuce.
It would be nice to know they are still somewhere.	Zai yi kyau a san har yanzu suna wani wuri.
She began to cry slowly.	Kuka ta fara yi a hankali.
What to do.	Abin da ya kamata a yi.
This is a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne.
No one else did.	Ba wanda kuma ya yi kamar ya samu.
We do not have time.	Ba mu da lokaci.
He waited further.	Ya jira kara.
He must see the truth.	Dole ne ya ga gaskiya.
We cannot afford this.	Ba za mu iya ba da wannan sauƙi ba.
No one is visible.	Babu kowa a gani.
We stayed for a week.	Mun zauna mako guda.
I do the same.	Ni ma ina yin hakan.
This article put me through the night.	Wannan labarin ya sa ni cikin dare.
They won.	Sun ci nasara.
I just caught it.	Na kama shi kawai.
I could not believe it.	Na kasa yarda da hakan.
But it does not fit.	Amma bai dace ba.
Then something amazing happened.	Sai wani abin mamaki ya faru.
I touch them.	Ina taba su.
I'll take it.	Zan kai shi.
There is no life in sight.	Babu wani rai a gani.
Many people gave him a very good answer.	Mutane da yawa sun ba shi amsa mai kyau sosai.
He knew he didn't have it.	Ya san ba shi da shi.
I hate it here.	Na ƙi shi a nan.
But that is not the case anymore.	Amma ba haka yake ba kuma.
He hopes, however.	Ya yi fatan, duk da haka.
They want to.	Sun so .
Play and watch as it unfolds.	Yi wasa da kallon yadda ake zama.
Good, fast reading.	Yana da kyau, karatu mai sauri.
She will not take the decision of her maker.	Ba za ta ɗauki shawarar mai yin ta ba.
Bring her food.	Kawo mata abinci.
One thing, not immediately.	Abu daya, ba nan take ba.
If so, that's fine.	Idan haka ne, haka abin yake.
It must be seen.	Lallai dole ne a gani.
She had better stay in the ark with them.	Gara ta zauna a cikin jirgin tare da su.
You live here in the future.	Kuna zaune a nan gaba ɗaya.
Don't tell me again.	Kada ta sake gaya mani.
But not all.	Amma ba duka ba.
This is a surprise.	Wannan abin mamaki ne.
We accept it.	Mun yarda da shi.
We will take the road today.	Za mu dauki hanya yau.
He did not tell anyone.	Bai gaya wa kowa ba.

It feels cold.	Ya ji sanyi.
It cannot be seen or touched.	Ba a iya gani ko taba shi.
They did it.	Sun yi shi.
Time alone travels fast.	Lokaci kadai yana tafiya da sauri.
We are looking for the necessary tools.	Muna neman kayan aikin da ake bukata.
But this is not true.	Amma wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Still good.	Har yanzu yayi kyau.
You have never told anyone this story.	Ba ka taba gaya wa kowa wannan labarin ba.
However, we learned about each other.	Duk da haka, mun koyi game da juna.
Nothing about.	Babu wani game da.
The outside is outside.	Waje yayi waje.
Hopefully she won't hear the news.	Ana fatan ba za ta ji labarin ba.
What happens, happens.	Abin da ke faruwa, ya faru.
However, he was not surprised.	Duk da haka, bai yi mamaki ba.
At the end of the day, he heard two more.	A karshen ranar, ya sake jin wasu biyu.
That surprised me.	Hakan ya bani mamaki.
My son is injured.	Yaro na ne ya ji rauni.
Everyone has a car.	Kowa yana da mota.
The main thing is that we are successful.	Babban abu shine mun ci nasara.
The game does the rest.	Wasan yayi sauran.
And they seem to be working right.	Kuma suna da alama suna aiki daidai.
He left in the morning.	Ya fita da safe.
Secondly.	Abu na biyu.
I don’t look like a role model.	Ban yi kama da abin koyi ba.
And that does not happen.	Kuma hakan baya faruwa.
You are as healthy as you are.	Kuna lafiya daidai yadda kuke.
They are his own.	Suna kansa.
Not finished.	Ba a gama ba.
It lasted two days.	Ya yi kwana biyu.
But first things first.	Amma farko abubuwa da farko.
I do not know how, but it is.	Ban san yadda ba, amma shi ne.
I almost never let her touch me.	Ban kusa bari ta taba ni ba.
Everyone thought he would never come back.	Kowa yayi tunanin ba zai dawo ba.
You have to stick with it to the end.	Dole ne ku tsaya tare da shi har zuwa ƙarshe.
What she did was amazing.	Abin da ta yi abin mamaki ne.
It's too cold.	Yayi sanyi sosai.
I think they are gone.	Ina tsammanin sun tafi.
Some even do not want me to call them.	Wasu ma ba sa son in kira su.
Not even an answer.	Ba ko da amsa.
But we got nothing.	Amma ba mu samu wani abu ba.
She heard everything very well.	Ta ji komai sosai.
We started looking for you.	Mun fara neman ku.
It really happened.	Da gaske ya faru.
I was, like, thinking of all these things.	Ni ne, kamar, mun yi tunanin duk waɗannan abubuwan.
Of course I like home meetings.	Tabbas ina sha'awar taron gida.
But that would not be true.	Amma hakan ba zai zama gaskiya ba.
Very little about that.	Kadan sosai game da hakan.
If you think you are surprised.	Idan kuna tunanin kun yi mamaki.
He sees something.	Yana ganin wani abu.
The same is true here.	Haka yake a nan.
And then the best thing happened.	Kuma sai abin da ya fi kyau ya faru.
There is no way we can lose this.	Babu yadda za a yi mu rasa wannan.
Of course, it is over.	Tabbas, ya wuce.
So they tell me.	Don haka suna gaya mani.
I can no longer take it.	Ba zan iya ƙara ɗauka ba.
But you will not.	Amma ba za ku yi ba.
Do you agree that they are right?	Kun yarda cewa sun yi daidai?
Everyone who has ever lived has died.	Duk wanda ya taɓa rayuwa ya mutu.
He had to do something.	Dole ne ya yi wani abu.
He made a good living by repairing home appliances.	Ya yi rayuwa mai kyau ta hanyar gyara kayan aikin gida.
She told him so.	Haka ta fad'a masa.
But we showed this.	Amma mun nuna wannan.
And she doesn't know you know.	Ita kuma ba ta san ka sani ba.
The sun has risen.	Rana ta fito.
There is no water.	Babu wani ruwa.
I have to say.	Dole ne in ce.
Not myself, of course.	Ba da kaina ba, ba shakka.
But he failed to say so.	Amma ya kasa cewa haka.
And that is the work we are doing now.	Kuma wannan shi ne aikin da muke yi a yanzu.
Now is your time to do one.	Yanzu ne lokacin ku don yin ɗaya.
Many people have used it.	Mutane da yawa sun yi amfani da shi.
Maybe this will continue to be easier after all.	Wataƙila wannan zai ci gaba da sauƙi bayan duk.
Now try a third time.	Yanzu gwada karo na uku.
He never knew.	Shi bai taba sani ba.
He kept running.	Ya ci gaba da gudu.
It can be beautiful.	Yana iya zama da kyau.
So it became empty.	Don haka sai ya zama ba komai.
It's fast enough to be useful.	Yana da sauri isa ya zama mai amfani.
However, there are a few though.	Duk da haka, akwai 'yan kaɗan ko da yake.
We never found out who he was.	Ba mu taɓa gano ainihin wanene shi ba.
You can think of others.	Kuna iya tunanin sauran.
It can be scary if that happens.	Yana iya zama mai ban tsoro idan abin ya faru.
We got what you needed.	Mun samu abin da kuke bukata.
Now it can be anyone.	Yanzu yana iya zama kowa.
Please do not be like that.	Don Allah kar a kasance haka.
We will see what happens next.	Za mu ga abin da zai faru a gaba na.
And we heard it.	Kuma mun ji ta.
This is not the way.	Wannan ba hanya ba ce.
He wanted them to know he was there too.	Ya so su san yana can ma.
Much more than that.	Da yawa fiye da haka.
I will prepare everything for you.	Zan shirya muku komai.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
Look, we will understand this.	Duba, za mu gane wannan.
And then he spoke more voluntarily.	Kuma sai ya yi magana fiye da son rai.
I had better tell you myself.	Gara in gaya muku da kaina.
I would highly recommend the house.	Zan ba da shawarar gida sosai.
Say, everyone.	Ka ce, kowa da kowa.
It's upstairs.	Yana da sama sama.
I beg to differ.	Ban yarda ba.
It seems to be out now.	Da alama ya fita yanzu.
It is not an easy task.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
I have nothing, man.	Ba ni da komai, mutum.
You have to be very close.	Dole ne ku kasance kusa sosai.
But it works really well.	Amma yana aiki sosai.
Everything is still fine.	Har yanzu komai ya tafi lafiya.
I can look for a new job.	Zan iya neman sabon aiki.
There is beauty in all of this.	Akwai kyau a cikin wannan duka.
Yet he drank.	Amma duk da haka yana sha.
Now, it was time to prepare.	Yanzu, ya kasance lokacin da aka shirya.
I am already mine.	Na riga na zama nawa.
Others are there a little.	Wasu kuma suna can kadan.
That is not fair.	Hakan bai dace ba.
Maybe it's time to do something more, something scary.	Wataƙila lokaci ya yi da za a ƙara yin wani abu, wani abu mai tsoro.
That feels so.	Wannan yana jin haka.
This is nothing new.	Wannan ba sabon abu bane.
If we lose each other, that is the end.	Idan muka rasa juna, karshen kenan.
I feel good.	Na ji dadi.
We must learn to get along.	Dole ne mu koyi shiga tare.
It is better to spend a little time early.	Gara a kashe ɗan lokaci kaɗan da wuri.
But after all nothing.	Amma bayan duk ba komai.
That never happened to me.	Hakan bai taba faruwa da ni ba.
It works for us.	Yana yi mana aiki.
But she did.	Amma ta yi.
We would have agreed with that.	Da ma mun yarda da hakan.
You have to stay.	Dole ku zauna.
We suffered so much together.	Mun sha wahala sosai tare.
He did not leave her.	Bai bar ta ba.
I more than think that there is no life there.	Na fi tunanin cewa babu rayuwa a can.
Give it a chance !.	Ka ba shi dama!.
I am not well.	Bana da lafiya.
It can work fine.	Tana iya yin aiki lafiya.
He is very happy to be here.	Yayi matukar farin ciki da zuwa nan.
We want them to continue.	Mun so su ci gaba.
The truth is not so.	Gaskiya ba haka bane.
If thought, in fact, is involved.	Idan tunani, a gaskiya, yana da hannu.
You cannot do this every week.	Ba za ku iya yin wannan kowane mako ba.
The next night, and the next night.	Da dare na gaba, da kuma na gaba kuma.
There is one thing to keep in mind.	Akwai abu daya da ya kamata ku tuna.
I have a lot of food.	Ina da abinci mai yawa.
But then she left.	Amma sai ta tafi.
What are we going to do with this?	Me za mu yi da wannan?
There is only one problem.	Matsala daya ce kawai.
This is a great time in the game.	Wannan babban lokaci ne a wasan.
It really made our day.	Da gaske ya sanya ranar mu.
And it was night.	Kuma dare ya yi.
It was amazing.	Ya kasance abin ban mamaki.
Do not rush.	Kada ku yi sauri da sauri.
He is here.	Yana nan.
It turns out he left the house.	Yana tabbatar da haka ya bar gidan.
It's really hard to look at this.	Da gaske yana da wuya a kalli wannan.
I went to the back of the train.	Na je bayan jirgin.
It is a mistake.	Kuskure ne.
They like what we want.	Suna son abin da muke so.
Some like to drink coffee in the morning.	Wasu suna son shan kofi da safe.
I just went to give her a place.	Na tafi ne kawai don in ba ta wani wuri.
I think he can.	Ina tsammanin cewa zai iya.
Wrong it should be here.	Ba daidai ba ne ya kamata ya kasance a nan.
Is that what you want.	Shin abin da kuke so kenan.
Start looking there.	Fara duba can.
You are still at home sleeping.	Har yanzu kuna gida kuna barci.
You never get it.	Ba ku taɓa samun ba.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
I drink water	Ina sha ruwa
She replied.	Ta amsa.
The car is moving.	Motar tana gudu.
But they are not happy either.	Amma su ma ba su ji daɗi ba.
I agree with the police.	Na yarda da 'yan sanda.
Just call to check you out.	Kira kawai don duba ku.
Some, not many.	Wasu, ba da yawa ba.
Certainly not because of unemployment.	Tabbas ba saboda rashin aikin yi ba ne.
She showed others how to do the same.	Ta nuna wa sauran yadda ake yin haka ma.
The time has not yet come.	Lokacin hakan bai zo ba tukuna .
The coffee tastes good.	Kofi ya yi dadi.
We love you, and we want you to be happy.	Muna son ku, kuma muna son ku yi farin ciki.
It was then.	A lokacin ne.
But now it is too late.	Amma yanzu ya makara.
This will certainly not be easy.	Wannan tabbas ba zai kasance mai sauƙi ba.
Not good, not very good.	Ba kyau ba, ba shi da kyau sosai.
Then she cooked for us.	Sai ta yi mana abinci.
It would be highly recommended.	Zai ba da shawarar sosai.
Nothing she felt changed that.	Ba abin da ta ji ya canza haka.
This led to a good education.	Hakan ya sa a yi karatu mai kyau.
I am very happy to have the opportunity.	Ina matukar farin ciki da samun damar.
People know me.	Mutane sun san ni.
That's the way it is.	Haka abin yake.
It's too much.	Ya yi yawa.
And by more than one way.	Kuma ta hanya fiye da ɗaya.
We feel there is something else.	Muna jin akwai wani abu kuma.
Then she got one.	Sai ta sami daya.
It feels right.	Ya ji daidai.
I have never been in it.	Ban taba zama a ciki ba.
Then he remembered.	Sai ya tuna.
If we miss this deadline.	Idan muka rasa wannan ranar ƙarshe.
I have a lot of money.	Ina da kuɗi da yawa.
You just have to.	Kai kawai ya yi.
Yet.	Tukuna.
I have to save it.	Dole ne in ajiye shi.
There are other things he needs to do.	Akwai sauran abubuwan da ya kamata ya yi.
It keeps growing, every year.	Ya ci gaba da girma, kowace shekara.
I got after you through everything.	Na samu bayan ku ta komai.
That's a lie.	Karya kenan.
I know they have nothing against me.	Na san ba su da komai a kaina.
He has everything to know.	Yana da duk abin da zai sani.
Everything you have in the house.	Duk abin da kuke da shi a gidan.
I felt sick about life.	Na ji rashin lafiya game da rayuwa.
You are still failing.	Har yanzu kuna kasa.
Still, it’s interesting.	Duk da haka, yana da ban sha'awa.
They appear outside.	Sun bayyana a waje.
Maybe it's too good.	Wataƙila yana da kyau sosai.
It is raining a lot.	Akwai ruwan sama da yawa.
This is a real feeling.	Wannan ji ne na gaske.
We need to show that.	Muna bukatar mu nuna hakan.
Everything will be fine.	Komai zai yi kyau.
There is still no one.	Har yanzu babu kowa.
I just love you.	Ina son ku kawai.
You start taking care of yourself.	Kun fara kula da kanku.
The location is nice.	Wuri yana da kyau.
Most often the latter.	Mafi sau da yawa na baya.
And so it was.	Kuma haka abin ya kasance.
But this is nothing.	Amma wannan ba komai bane.
No, much better.	A'a, fiye da kyau.
And now it seems to be happening again.	Kuma yanzu da alama yana sake faruwa.
This has happened before.	Wannan ya faru a baya.
Not there.	Babu a wurin.
That's what she wrote!	Abin da ta rubuta ke nan!
He became real after that.	Ya zama na gaske bayan haka.
She worked with him.	Ta yi aiki da shi.
So I changed.	Ta haka na canza.
They have to do something about it.	Dole ne su yi wani abu game da shi.
So kind of it.	Don haka irin sa ne.
Later we will look for something.	Daga baya za mu nemi wani abu.
I felt uncomfortable about myself.	Na ji ba dadi game da kaina.
And he did an amazing job.	Kuma ya yi wani aiki mai ban mamaki.
One way or another.	Wata hanya mafi kyau.
And not just with them.	Kuma ba kawai tare da su ba.
It is the first time.	Shi ne karo na farko.
He did not write for her.	Bai rubuta mata ba.
He has no time.	Ba shi da lokaci.
But no one knows how to do anything about it.	Amma babu wanda ya san yadda za a yi wani abu game da shi.
Think of a way out.	Ka yi tunanin yadda ake fita.
It made me think of myself.	Ya sanya ni tunanin kaina.
The new man seems to be indifferent to everyone.	Sabon mutumin ya zama kamar ba ruwan kowa da kowa.
She will not die alone.	Ba za ta mutu ita kaɗai ba.
Remember, whatever you want, you already have and you are.	Ka tuna, duk abin da kuke so, kun riga kuna da kuma kuna.
He left us here.	Ya bar mu a nan.
I met many people at the venue.	Na hadu da mutane da yawa a wurin bikin.
Maybe he's sick.	Wataƙila ba shi da lafiya.
I feel just funny.	Ina jin abin ban dariya ne kawai.
The greatest happiness comes from helping others.	Babban jin daɗin rayuwa yana zuwa ta wurin taimakon wasu.
It's time to dump her.	Lokacin tafiya yayi.
He is playing.	Yana wasa.
Not this time or any other time.	Ba wannan lokaci ba ko wani lokaci.
Finally, the time has come.	A ƙarshe, lokaci ya yi.
This is something new for me.	Wannan sabon abu ne a gare ni.
He previously lived for three years.	A baya can ya zauna da shekaru uku.
Looking forward to the weekend at home.	Yana fatan zuwa karshen mako a gida.
Not everyone wants to be known for it.	Ba kowa ba ne yake son a san ainihin su ga kowa.
We have work to do.	Muna da aikin da za mu yi.
He says a lot is true.	Ya ce da yawa gaskiya ne.
The children were not told what had happened until later.	Ba a gaya wa yara abin da ya faru ba sai daga baya.
They showed her how to do it.	Suka nuna mata yadda zata yi.
He did not think it was possible to live that way.	Bai yi tunanin za a iya yin rayuwa haka ba.
It was then that she asked for help.	A lokacin ne ta nemi taimako.
Of course, it was a really good dinner.	Tabbas, abincin dare ne mai kyau sosai.
She eventually died.	Ta mutu a ƙarshe.
An injury started.	Wani rauni ya fara tashi.
They have to do something new.	Dole ne su yi wani sabon abu.
This is a wonderful reading of an amazing project.	Wannan karatu ne mai ban mamaki na wani aiki mai ban mamaki.
The doctor came to talk to me.	Likitan ya zo ya yi magana da ni.
Good day though.	Kyakkyawan rana ko da yake.
We can talk later.	Za mu iya magana daga baya.
They wanted to be sure.	Sun so su tabbata.
You can always be the best.	Kuna iya zama mafi kyau koyaushe.
He reached home and showed it to him.	Ya isa gida ya nuna masa.
That's what everyone does.	Abin da kowa ke yi ke nan.
I have access to things now.	Ina da damar zuwa abubuwa yanzu.
John will write with both hands.	John zai rubuta da hannu biyu.
He will think.	Zai yi tunani .
He went.	Ya tafi.
It was, and still is, a very good boat.	Ya kasance, kuma har yanzu, jirgin ruwa ne mai kyau sosai.
No, she is better.	A'a, ta fi kyau.
I remember being very interesting.	Na tuna zama mai ban sha'awa sosai.
They cannot recognize him.	Ba za su iya gane shi ba.
Happiness would not be good if it were not for sadness.	Farin ciki ba zai yi kyau ba idan ba don bakin ciki ba.
She was released a day later.	Bayan kwana daya aka sake ta.
I wish we had started this years ago.	Ina ma da mun fara wannan shekaru da suka wuce.
You should go if you can.	Ya kamata ku tafi idan kuna iya.
No one told me that like you.	Babu wanda ya gaya mani haka kamar ku.
I am familiar with you.	Na saba muku.
They make us laugh, work and celebrate.	Sun sa mu dariya, aiki da taron.
But we still have to figure out how.	Amma har yanzu dole ne mu gano yadda.
We cut the best.	Mun yanke mafi kyau.
He knows what to do.	Ya san abin da ya kamata a yi.
The laughter was delicious.	Dariya yayi dadi.
That's what he said.	Haka ya fada.
This should not be done.	Bai kamata a yi haka ba.
But for dinner.	Amma don abincin dare.
It is not finished yet.	Har yanzu ba a gama ba.
This break is a new place.	Wannan karya sabon wuri ne.
He plans to try this again.	Ya shirya ya sake gwada wannan.
There is no reason to smoke here.	Babu dalilin shan taba a nan.
I feel fine here.	Ina jin lafiya a nan.
So that is the way to remove it.	Don haka ita ce hanyar cire shi.
But of course we already know that too.	Amma tabbas mun riga mun san hakan ma.
He managed to do it right.	Ya kula ya yi daidai.
I talked to him.	Na yi magana da shi.
There is not really much we can do.	Babu gaske da yawa da za mu iya yi.
, as you wish.	, yadda kuke so.
They’re not good, right.	Ba su da kyau, daidai.
Or ill.	Ko rashin lafiya.
He passed there.	Ya wuce can.
This is the work he has done for himself.	Wannan shi ne aikin da ya yi wa kansa.
We have it, and we are here.	Muna da shi, kuma muna nan.
I can re-access them if desired.	Zan iya sake samun damar yin amfani da su idan an so.
No one can change it.	Babu wanda zai iya canza shi.
He asked me for money.	Ya tambaye ni kudi.
You will stay here now.	Za ku zauna a nan yanzu.
Everyone loves her.	Kowa ya so ta.
Why do people not reuse them?	Me ya sa mutane ba sa sake yin amfani da su?
We know how it is.	Mun san yadda abin yake.
He does not live here, and he does not look like him.	Ba ya zama a nan, kuma ba ya kama da shi.
She is tired of work.	Ta gaji da aiki.
In fact he suggested we keep it.	A gaskiya ya ba da shawarar mu ajiye ta.
Let's hope so.	Mu yi fatan haka.
I’m not sure what’s going on inside of you.	Ban tabbata da abin da ke faruwa a cikin ku ba.
Then, after a while, the first man did it again.	Bayan haka, bayan ɗan lokaci, mutumin na farko ya sake yin hakan.
She called him back.	Ta kira shi a baya.
She realized she was crying.	Ta gane tana kuka.
Go ahead, make this your own.	Ci gaba, mai da wannan na ku.
We did a good job on it.	Mun yi aiki mai kyau a kansa.
Tell me you love me.	Ka gaya mani cewa kana so na.
And we are tired.	Kuma mun gaji.
Both did not.	Biyu ba su yi ba.
We do not know what to think.	Ba mu san abin da za mu yi tunani ba.
I closed the restaurant.	Na rufe gidan abinci.
Not from the beginning.	Ba daga farko ba.
I don't have anyone to play with today.	Ba ni da wanda zan yi wasa da shi yau.
I wear it a little.	Na sa shi kadan.
I'm not done.	Ban gama ba.
You will not get much sleep tonight.	Ba za ku sami barci mai yawa ba a daren yau.
His car is over.	Motar sa ta kare.
Time to have lunch, too.	Lokaci don in sami abincin rana, kuma.
Of course someone told you.	Tabbas wani ya gaya maka.
He is an interesting and wonderful person.	Mutum ne mai ban sha'awa kuma mai ban mamaki.
Everything you think works.	Duk abin da kuke tunani yana aiki.
I will die	zan mutu
He raised his hand.	Ya daga hannu.
Lots of things	Abubuwa masu yawa
A real person knows how to walk away from a palace.	Mutum na gaske ya san yadda zai yi tafiya daga fada.
When the moon is full, we cannot sleep.	Idan ya cika wata, ba za mu iya yin barci ba.
Despite.	Shi ne.
He told us himself.	Ya gaya mana da kansa.
There are a lot of things going on during these.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ke faruwa a lokacin waɗannan.
He did it himself, no one told him.	Shi ya yi da kan sa, babu wanda ya ce masa.
This just got more interesting.	Wannan kawai ya sami ƙarin ban sha'awa.
I know some have fulfilled everything.	Na san wasu sun cika komai.
I really want to wear this.	Ina so in sa wannan sosai.
She wondered if he even knew what it was.	Ta yi tunanin ko ya ma san menene.
Maybe a year later.	Wataƙila shekara bayan.
They need something from you.	Suna buƙatar wani abu daga gare ku.
He wanted to surprise me.	Ya so ya bani mamaki.
I only know the name.	Na san sunan kawai.
For me, he thought.	A gare ni ne, ya yi tunani.
But tell me this.	Amma gaya mani wannan.
It is not.	Ba shi da.
But we are making progress.	Amma muna samun ci gaba.
You will be amazed.	Za ku yi mamaki.
They are afraid of making mistakes.	Sun ji tsoron yin kuskure.
She doesn't like it.	Ba ta son shi.
Enjoy the moment.	Ji daɗin lokacin.
Absolutely.	Babu shakka.
Once, twice, three times.	Sau ɗaya, sau biyu, sau uku.
Not just kids anymore.	Ba yara kawai ba kuma.
That is a fact.	Wannan ya zama gaskiya.
So he says a lot.	Don haka ya ce da yawa.
Something is about to happen.	Wani abu yake shirin yi.
I am very happy about that.	Na yi matukar farin ciki da hakan.
He began to speak.	Ya fara magana.
I can’t just sell to keep going.	Ba zan iya kawai sayar da in ci gaba ba.
And it was an opportunity to come first.	Kuma dama ce ta fara zuwa.
That night.	Wannan daren.
For us, this seems simple.	A gare mu, wannan yana kama da sauƙi.
He said people live in fear.	Yace mutane suna rayuwa cikin tsoro.
No one knows exactly what happened.	Babu wanda ya san ainihin abin da ya faru.
This hurts.	Wannan yayi zafi.
No one ate.	Babu wanda ya ci abinci.
Don't say now.	Kar a ce yanzu.
Our food does not last more than a week.	Abincin mu baya wuce mako guda.
She was not very well at the time.	Ba ta da lafiya sosai a lokacin.
You have to put the work into it.	Dole ne ku sanya aikin a ciki.
Things cannot go on like this.	Abubuwa ba za su iya ci gaba kamar haka ba.
They think so.	Su ma suna tsammanin hakan.
They sat for a long time looking at each other.	Sun dade suna zaune suna kallon juna.
Don’t try to do both at the same time, though.	Kada ku yi ƙoƙarin yin duka biyu lokaci ɗaya, ko da yake.
Keep it up.	Ci gaba da abin.
I like it a lot.	Ina son shi da yawa.
Not much can be said about it.	Ba duka da yawa za a ce game da shi ba.
We're going out the other way.	Za mu fita wata hanya.
When he died.	Lokacin da ya mutu.
That will help.	Hakan zai taimaka.
I think that is true for life.	Ina tsammanin hakan gaskiya ne ga rayuwa.
You can see this on the movie easily.	Kuna iya ganin hakan akan fim cikin sauƙi.
There is little time to do anything.	Akwai ɗan lokaci kaɗan don yin wani abu.
We do not know what will happen.	Ba mu san abin da zai faru ba.
That's good.	Hakan yayi kyau.
I did not receive an answer.	Ban sami amsa ba.
And simple.	Kuma mai sauƙi.
Go run with this.	Tafi gudu da wannan.
But they do not want to wait too long.	Amma ba sa son jira da yawa.
Not like that, he wouldn’t do it.	Ba irin wannan ba, ba zai yi ba.
The police arrested me next.	'Yan sanda sun kama ni a gaba.
But they are simple.	Amma suna da mai sauƙi.
Whether you feel it or not.	Kuna ji ko ba ku ji ba.
First, understand how it works.	Na farko, fahimci yadda yake aiki.
It’s good to have something go right.	Yana da kyau a sami wani abu ya tafi daidai.
I can think of many things to do with it.	Zan iya tunanin abubuwa da yawa da za su yi da shi.
Children are honest.	Yara masu gaskiya ne.
Very hot, in fact.	Zafi sosai, a gaskiya.
I still need to check it out more.	Har yanzu ina bukatar in kara duba shi.
We need a new place.	Muna bukatar sabon wuri.
Not everyone was happy with the decision.	Duk mutumin bai yi farin ciki da shawarar ba.
He didn't say anything to me.	Ko kadan bai ce min komai ba.
The children are sleeping well.	Yara suna barci lafiya.
She too will not marry.	Ita ma ba za ta yi aure ba.
I think you are right here.	Ina tsammanin kuna nan daidai.
Sometimes lies are not lies.	Wani lokaci karya ba karya ba ce.
It has to be somewhere.	Dole ta kasance wani wuri.
I have two more things for you.	Ina da wasu abubuwa guda biyu a gare ku.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai bane.
It is one thing for a child to suffer.	Abu ɗaya ne yaro ya sha wahala.
I really don't want to know.	Lallai bana son sani.
I will not let them get it.	Ba zan bar su su samu ba.
Call me if anything happens.	Kira ni idan wani abu ya faru.
I told him things, but it wasn't true.	Na gaya masa abubuwa, amma ba gaskiya ba.
We think it should.	Muna ganin ya kamata.
The work was like something we had never seen before.	Aikin ya kasance kamar wani abu da ba mu taɓa gani ba.
I plan to do it tonight.	Na shirya yin shi a daren yau.
She felt sure she would never walk again.	Ta ji tabbas ba za ta sake tafiya ba.
He will come tomorrow.	Zai zo nan gobe.
I will show you in it.	Zan nuna muku a ciki.
Maybe they’ve heard it all before.	Wataƙila sun ji duka a baya.
He has been helping her so far.	Ya kasance yana taimaka mata har zuwa yanzu.
I got this job.	Na sami wannan aiki.
I heard her.	Na ji ta.
It is me	Ni ne ni
No one sees.	Babu wanda yake gani.
Live well.	Yi rayuwa da kyau.
And you are not the only one you want.	Kuma ba shi kadai kuke so ba.
Above them he wore a leather jacket.	Sama da su ya sa rigar fata.
The reason for.	Dalilin da.
I can not wait.	Ba zan iya jira ba.
I wondered what was said.	Na yi mamakin me aka ce.
That should be sufficient enough.	Wannan ya isa.
They will not worry.	Ba za su damu ba.
We need that.	Muna bukatar hakan.
You will be back for more.	Za ku dawo don ƙarin.
Hear how you speak.	Ji yadda kuke magana.
Do not fix it.	Kar a gyara shi.
They are coming and going.	Suna zuwa su tafi.
And here we live.	Kuma a nan muka zauna.
So he did not kill him.	Don haka bai kashe shi ba.
It is later.	Daga baya ne.
I would like this swimsuit	Ina son wannan rigar iyo
I touched it gently.	Na taba shi a hankali.
Nice to laugh.	Yayi kyau don dariya.
They have other things to worry about.	Suna da sauran abubuwan da za su damu.
I think the plan you wrote is correct.	Ina ganin shirin da kuka rubuta daidai ne.
I hear you.	Ina jin ku.
They continue to walk this path.	Sun ci gaba da tafiya wannan hanya.
But he can get more than that.	Amma zai iya samun fiye da haka.
Life does not happen that way.	Rayuwa ba haka take faruwa ba.
There are only three of them.	Su uku ne kawai.
You like it.	Kuna son shi.
He doesn't want me to talk to you, you know.	Ba ya son in yi maka magana, ka sani.
It appears in this first article.	Ya bayyana a wannan labarin na farko.
How are you still?	Har yanzu yaya kuke.
So be it.	Haka ya kasance.
I think there are two things here.	Ina tsammanin akwai abubuwa biyu a nan.
You are good with it.	Kuna da kyau tare da shi.
What help do you think?	Menene taimako kuke tunani?
Three people entered this room.	Mutane uku ne suka shiga wannan dakin.
He can come and go as he pleases.	Yana iya zuwa ya tafi yadda ya ga dama.
It needs fixing.	Yana bukatar gyara.
He wanted it.	Ya so shi.
He is still there.	Har yanzu yana can.
I got the need	Na samu bukata
The program continues.	Shirin yana ci gaba.
But we know what we know.	Amma mun san abin da muka sani.
I don't know what they are, though.	Ban san abin da suke ba, ko da yake.
Everything is cold.	Komai ya yi sanyi.
He will surely love it.	Tabbas zai so shi.
Inside you are.	Daga ciki kai ne.
He lived an honest and honest life.	Ya yi rayuwa mai gaskiya da gaskiya.
Drink this.	Sha wannan.
There are a lot of people there.	Akwai mutane da yawa a wurin.
It can be hard to find.	Yana iya zama da wahala a samu.
And it certainly won't be published here.	Kuma tabbas ba za a buga shi a nan ba.
He wanted her.	Ya so ta.
She began to have positive thoughts.	Ta fara samun kyakkyawan tunani.
I'm not feeling well today.	Bani da kyau sosai yau.
There he stayed.	Nan ya zauna.
He just kept himself there.	Kansa ne kawai ya ajiye a wurin.
So this is very interesting.	Don haka wannan yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
I have been there once.	Na taba zuwa wurin sau daya.
She will have this opportunity.	Za ta sami wannan dama.
I'm not trying to be hot.	Ba ina ƙoƙarin zama zafi ba.
Do the wrong thing.	Yi abubuwa ba daidai ba.
He is said to have known everything.	Aka ce ya san komai.
It is the third month.	A wata na uku ne.
But it was so.	Amma ya kasance haka.
He did not know what to say.	Bai san me zai ce ba.
Give me the right.	Ka ba ni daidai.
It will be something.	Zai zama wani abu.
Learn to say no.	Koyi a ce a'a.
The third time he soon got up.	A karo na uku bai dade ba ya tashi.
But he already knew.	Amma ya riga ya sani.
Now we are arrested.	Yanzu an kama mu.
Also the person is not anywhere in the room.	Haka kuma mutumin ba ko ina a dakin.
And if he dies, so be it.	Idan kuma zai mutu, haka ya kasance.
He never got anyone to sit here alone.	Bai taɓa samun kowa ya zauna a nan shi kaɗai ba.
I started to suffer.	Na fara wahala.
But he still failed to do so.	Amma har yanzu ya kasa yi.
Let's be honest too.	Mu yi gaskiya kuma.
They know when to do things and why.	Sun san lokacin da suke yin abubuwa da kuma dalilin da ya sa.
They do not travel together.	Ba sa tafiya tare.
They must do what they are supposed to do.	Dole ne su yi abin da ya kamata su yi.
I learned to think and feel for myself.	Na koyi tunani da ji da kaina.
Let me try to finish this.	Bari in gwada gama wannan.
The door is closed.	An rufe kofar.
Take your time and he advises you to walk slowly.	Ɗauki lokaci kuma ya ba ku shawarar ku yi tafiya a hankali.
About tomorrow.	Game da gobe.
We always laughed a lot.	Kullum muna dariya sosai.
We will just have fun.	Za mu ji daɗi kawai.
There is no such thing.	Babu irin wannan.
However, it was too cold in the rain.	Ko ta yaya, sanyi ya yi yawa a cikin ruwan sama.
So let's do this.	Don haka bari mu yi wannan.
This is very good.	Wannan yana da kyau sosai.
So you did.	Don haka kuka yi.
I'll call her.	Zan kira ta.
I tell myself things are not.	Ina gaya wa kaina abubuwa ba su ne ba.
He used it for two years.	Ya yi amfani da shi har tsawon shekaru biyu.
Do not touch!	Kar a taba!
This car is very comfortable.	Wannan motar tana da daɗi sosai.
In fact, it explains everything.	A gaskiya ma, yana bayyana komai.
Everyone wants to succeed.	Kowa yana so ya yi nasara.
Enough.	Ya isa.
All you need to do is know.	Duk abin da kuke buƙatar yi shine sani.
You are ready to play.	Kun shirya don yin wasa.
You are beautiful too.	Kuna da kyau kuma.
Make it work for your visual aids.	Sanya shi yayi aiki don kayan aikin ku da ake iya gani.
But in reality, they are more difficult.	Amma a gaskiya, sun fi wuya.
Whatever it takes, we will win!	Duk abin da ya ɗauka, za mu yi nasara!
He will do nothing.	Ba zai yi komai ba.
It is one of my favorite things to do.	Yana daya daga cikin abubuwan da na fi so in yi.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
This is so delicious.	Wannan yana da dadi sosai.
Yet, he did.	Amma duk da haka, ya yi.
I would like a book.	Ina son littafin.
Please show me the way to the channel.	Don Allah a nuna min hanyar tashar.
It seems so.	Ga alama haka.
I tried to get past them.	Na yi ƙoƙari na wuce su.
It took a while before he came back.	Ya ɗauki ɗan lokaci kafin ya dawo.
You must remember your name.	Dole ne ku tuna sunan ku.
But it is not.	Amma ba haka ba ne.
I will be very happy if you like.	Zan yi farin ciki sosai idan kuna so.
The drink did not come.	Abin sha bai zo ba.
This work cannot be allowed to continue.	Ba za a iya barin wannan aikin ya ci gaba ba.
He did not speak for a long time.	Bai dade da magana ba.
I should feel right at home.	Ya kamata in ji daidai a gida.
See how cold it will be.	Ka ga yadda sanyi zai kasance.
I am with you	Ina tare da ku
Maybe we will do in the future.	Watakila za mu yi a nan gaba.
This is too much for me.	Wannan ya yi mini yawa.
No one ever heard anything.	Ba wanda ya taɓa jin komai.
We have to be on top of it.	Dole ne mu kasance a kansa.
She tells you exactly what she needs.	Ta gaya maka daidai abin da take bukata.
Help has been slowly coming.	Taimako ya kasance a hankali yana zuwa.
He came here yesterday.	Ya zo nan jiya.
It's like someone else is there.	Kamar wani ne a wurin.
Read this article in its entirety.	Karanta wannan labarin gaba ɗaya.
Let us know how this works for you.	Bari mu san yadda hakan ke aiki a gare ku.
She should have been with him by now.	Ya kamata ta kasance tare da shi zuwa yanzu.
So give it to me.	Sai ka bani.
Now she was inside.	Yanzu ta kasance a ciki.
I want to see you up and down.	Ina son ganin ku sama da kusa.
So you will surely be happy.	Don haka tabbas za ku yi farin ciki.
This does not work.	Wannan baya aiki.
She saw things that one should not do.	Ta ga abubuwan da bai kamata mutum ya yi ba.
I think others will hear this movie better than me.	Ina tsammanin wasu za su iya jin wannan fim fiye da ni.
This is the way of the world.	Wannan ita ce hanyar duniya.
It fits really well.	Ya dace sosai.
I think everything is very tasty.	Ina tsammanin komai yana da daɗi sosai.
But it fits the material.	Amma ya dace da kayan.
He might think so later.	Zai iya tunanin hakan daga baya.
That's what you got.	Abin da kuka samu ke nan.
This can be achieved in the following way.	Ana iya samun wannan ta hanya mai zuwa.
She moved, though.	Ta koma, ko.
Life here seems to be unsatisfactory.	Rayuwa a nan ta yi kamar ba ta da kyau.
I want to say something here.	Ina so in ce wani abu a nan.
He did not know what.	Bai san me ba.
I really want to go with him.	Na yi matukar son tafiya tare da shi.
But access is what we say.	Amma damar shiga ita ce mu ce.
Right one, maybe.	Dama daya, watakila.
It is also amazing.	Shi ma, abin ban mamaki ne.
It delivers food home.	Yana kai kayan abinci gida.
I am alone.	Ni kadai ne.
There is no place for fear or second thought.	Babu sauran wurin tsoro ko tunani na biyu.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Kun tabbata kuna son yin hakan?
Not because it’s funny.	Ba don yana da ban dariya ba.
Maybe you will buy something new.	Wataƙila za ku sayi sabon abu.
Two were killed.	An kashe biyu.
He hopes that will be the case.	Ya yi fatan hakan zai kasance.
Anyone can do this.	Kowa zai iya yin wannan.
We did a lot of things together.	Mun yi abubuwa da yawa tare.
You can try this and see it is not yours.	Kuna iya gwada wannan kuma ku ga ba na ku ba ne.
Yet people keep trying to do them.	Amma duk da haka mutane suna ci gaba da ƙoƙarin yin su.
He hit it hard.	Ya buga shi sosai.
Think.	Ka yi tunanin.
Get to know each other.	Ku san juna.
Change the world.	Canza duniya.
It will not be difficult.	Ba zai yi wahala ba.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Babu wani abu ba daidai ba.
I worked with my supervisor.	Na yi aiki da mai kula da ni.
The rest are nothing.	Sauran ba su da komai.
Or if you are worried about something.	Ko kuma idan kun damu da wani abu.
Who is he?	Wanene shi.
There is no room for anything else.	Babu dakin wani abu kuma.
He caught me.	Ya kama ni.
I want to talk to him.	Ina so in yi magana da shi.
She made a mistake.	Ta yi kuskure.
She is her favorite.	Ita ce ta fi so.
The world is waiting.	Duniya tana jira.
We have to do the work.	Dole ne mu yi aikin.
It's easier for him.	Ya fi masa sauƙi.
It is very healthy.	Yana da lafiya sosai.
He told her to leave.	Ya ce mata ta bari.
This method does not work.	Wannan hanyar ba ta aiki.
He just wanted to fix the end.	Ya so kawai ya gyara karshen.
But he is not alone.	Amma ba shi kaɗai ba.
However, not everyone.	Duk da haka, ba kowa ba ne.
I say now.	Na ce yanzu.
You women.	Kai mata.
It is a funny movie.	Fim ne mai ban dariya.
Now it's time for the big event.	Yanzu lokaci ya yi don babban taron.
Try both today.	Gwada biyu a yau.
She did not know why he would do such a thing.	Ba ta san dalilin da ya sa zai yi wani abu haka ba.
I don't know anymore.	Ban sani ba kuma.
I remember that.	Na tuna da haka.
He kept calling coming.	Ya yi ta kira yana zuwa.
Not a good thing.	Ba abu mai kyau ba.
They love kids.	Suna son yara.
I talked to them.	Na yi magana da su.
He goes in and closes the door.	Yana shiga ya rufe kofar.
The large fish slowly floated to the water.	Babban irin kifi ya yi iyo a hankali zuwa ga ruwa.
But nothing helped.	Amma babu wani abu da ya taimaka.
Now she does not have any of these things.	Yanzu ba ta da ko ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan.
No one says so.	Ba wanda ya ce haka ne.
I have never seen anything like this before.	Na taba ganin wani abu kamar wannan a baya.
I would have stopped.	Da zan tsaya.
You must remove it from it.	Dole ne ku cire shi daga gare shi.
I thought of playing this year.	Na yi tunanin yin wasa a wannan shekara.
Have a good night.	Sai da safe.
It looks so good.	Ya yi kyau sosai.
It will take a lot of time.	Zai ɗauki lokaci mai yawa.
Come here as soon as you can!	Ku zo nan da sauri kamar yadda za ku iya!
She was funny.	Ta kasance mai ban dariya.
It took a while, but it worked.	Ya ɗauki hankali, amma ya yi aiki.
The time has come.	Lokaci ya yi gaba.
Now it's up to him.	Yanzu ya kasance a kansa.
The more the restaurant, the better the food.	Mafi yawan gidan cin abinci, mafi kyawun abinci.
Even children feel that way.	Har yara ma suna jin haka.
What a surprise!	Abin mamaki!
They think that everyone feels the same way.	Suna tunanin cewa kowa yana jin yadda yake ji.
They say little.	Suka ce kaɗan.
How does everything feel.	Yaya kara komai ya ji.
He gave her the book.	Ya ba ta littafin.
But so far, he has been watching closely.	Amma ya zuwa yanzu, yana kallon a hankali.
He told me why he didn't have much.	Ya ce min shi ya sa ba ya da yawa.
Try using them.	Gwada amfani da su.
I understand why you can’t.	Na fahimci dalilin da ya sa ba za ku iya ba.
But you know.	Amma ka sani .
Maybe I wasn't even there.	Wataƙila ma ban kasance a wurin ba.
This is my favorite bracelet.	Wannan shine abin hannu da na fi so.
But you can't kill me.	Amma ba za ku iya kashe ni ba.
This can be easily changed.	Ana iya canza wannan cikin sauƙi.
I have to think we will succeed in this thing.	Dole ne in yi tunanin za mu ci nasara a wannan abu.
And we agree you do too.	Kuma mun yarda ku ma kuna yi.
He was concerned about his identity.	Ya damu da ainihin sa.
Or he may have committed suicide.	Ko kuma ya sa ya kashe kansa.
She could not think of anything to say.	Ta kasa tunanin komai za ta ce.
You can read more about my stay here.	Kuna iya karanta game da zama na a nan.
We can't be late for school.	Ba za mu iya makara zuwa makaranta ba.
Some kids don’t like it.	Wasu yara ba sa so.
And we may not understand other people very well.	Kuma ba za mu fahimci sauran mutane sosai ba.
Exactly as it should be.	Daidai ne yadda ya kamata.
This is a trip.	Wannan tafiya ce.
It should be home.	Ya kamata ya kasance gida.
Below.	A kasa.
We talk a lot.	Muna magana da yawa.
I really like this stuff !.	Ina matukar son wannan kayan!.
I was surprised by that.	Na yi mamakin hakan.
Remember that the second will pay you exactly.	Ka tuna cewa na biyu zai biya ku daidai.
They want to hear you.	Suna son su ji ku.
But you need to stop lying to me.	Amma kana bukatar ka daina yi mani karya.
Not sure if this is what you need.	Ban tabbata ko abin da kuke bukata ke nan ba.
But he doesn't want to talk to anyone.	Amma ba ya son magana da kowa.
I feel good.	Na ji dadi.
Don't ask me how they did it.	Kar ku tambaye ni yadda suka yi.
The truth is nothing.	Gaskiya ba komai.
We will not do it until you are ready.	Ba za mu yi ba sai kun shirya.
They will expect this from me.	Za su yi tsammanin wannan daga gare ni.
She was today.	Ta kasance yau.
Don't be late.	Kar ku makara.
I know she'll want to take you there.	Na san za ta so ta kai ku can.
He did not drink.	Bai sha ba.
They have a little more volume.	Suna da ɗan ƙara kaɗan.
I wondered what else they would want.	Na yi mamakin me kuma za su so.
You know how it will be.	Kun san yadda hakan zai kasance.
She has a hand in how you are.	Tana da hannu akan yadda kuke.
He left.	Ya tafi .
As he says, it is not so.	Kamar yadda ya ce, ba haka yake ba.
Prepare the tools.	Shirya kayan aikin.
But this feeling.	Amma wannan ji.
But, at the time, it was the last thing we thought of.	Amma, a lokacin, shine abu na ƙarshe da muke tunani.
But perhaps, it should continue.	Amma watakila, ya kamata ya ci gaba.
He never said that.	Ya taba cewa.
At the end of your work.	A karshen aikin ku.
But we have to go.	Amma dole ne mu tafi.
I know how she felt when you asked me for money.	Na san yadda ta ji lokacin da kuka tambaye ni kuɗi.
Not only this.	Ba wannan kadai ba.
No player is better than two.	Babu dan wasa da ya fi biyu.
Which is the third.	Wanda shine na uku.
Join the event.	Shiga cikin taron.
It's something.	Yana da wani abu.
He is said to be the eldest brother.	An ce shi ne babban yaya.
Nothing is certain.	Babu wani abu da ya tabbata.
That sounds really good.	Hakan yayi kyau sosai.
I do really well, though.	Ina yin da gaske, ko da yake.
Now then.	Yanzu sai.
Often.	Sau da yawa.
Nothing.	Ba komai.
They will not work.	Ba za su yi aiki ba.
It is uncertain.	Ba shi da tabbas.
How much money do you have?	Kudi nawa kuke da shi?
But then he made things interesting.	Amma sai ya sanya abubuwa su zama masu ban sha'awa.
That's all we can do.	Abin da za mu iya yi ke nan.
He was not afraid.	Bai ji tsoro ba.
The dress is gone.	Rigar ta tafi.
No one is here except us here.	Ba kowa ba a nan sai mu a nan.
I think you will like it too.	Ina tsammanin za ku so shi ma.
Maybe, you don’t have what to lose.	Wataƙila, ba ku sami abin da za ku rasa ba.
But it is amazing.	Amma abin ban mamaki ne.
We will get great things.	Za mu sami babban abu.
It was not so.	Ya kasance haka ba.
I like it all, please.	Ina son shi duka, don Allah.
Besides, he needs time to think.	Ban da haka, yana bukatar lokaci don yin tunani.
They say everyone has one in the world.	Sun ce kowa yana da daya a duniya.
That he should not talk to anyone like that.	Cewa kada yayi magana da kowa haka.
So let them get it.	Don haka bari su samu.
Some girls got involved.	Wasu 'yan mata sun shiga ciki.
They are no longer children.	Ba yara bane kuma.
Which is definitely good.	Wanda tabbas yayi kyau.
She had to try it out for sure.	Dole ne ta gwada shi don ta tabbata.
He continued to work for others.	Ya ci gaba da yi wa wasu aiki.
It was an exciting time.	Lokaci ne mai ban sha'awa.
Tell me, though.	Fada mani, ko da yake.
I want to wear it.	Ina son saka shi.
I think she knew nothing.	Ina tsammanin ba ta san komai ba.
Money is hard to come by this year.	Kudi ya yi wuya a samu a bana.
He stood waiting for them to catch up.	Ya tsaya yana jira su kama.
But she was wrong.	Amma ta yi kuskure.
I can't find a place to say how you got there.	Ban sami inda za a ce yadda ka samu ba.
It can be.	Yana iya zama.
He said he would come tomorrow.	Yace gobe zai zo.
Maybe they know something.	Wataƙila sun san wani abu.
I like everything about it.	Ina son komai game da shi.
It took a while before he put it down.	Ya ɗauki ɗan lokaci kafin ya ajiye shi.
Make some cool calls.	Yi wasu kira mai sanyi.
He could easily lose her.	Zai iya rasa ta da sauƙi.
People want answers.	Mutane suna son amsa.
I do not recommend this.	Ba na ba da shawarar wannan ba.
But there was no time at the time.	Amma babu lokaci a lokacin.
He didn't even try to feel like he didn't want to.	Bai ko gwada jin ba ya so.
It was a big event when it was finished.	Ya kasance babban taron lokacin da aka gama shi.
You know how it is.	Kun san yadda abin yake.
Remember how good it is.	Tuna yadda yayi kyau.
Some did not pay.	Wasu ba su biya ba.
He was afraid it would not be closed.	Ya ji tsoron kada a rufe.
But it didn't work out.	Amma bai yi kyau ba.
We wonder if they will ever leave.	Muna mamakin ko za su taɓa barin.
I think it's time you met.	Ina tsammanin lokaci ya yi da kuka hadu.
We didn’t want her hurt so we prepared her.	Ba mu so ta ji rauni don haka mun shirya ta.
They did not want me to join.	Ba su so in shiga ba.
The more effort you put into it, the better you will do.	Yawan ƙoƙarin da kuka yi, mafi kyawun za ku yi.
There must be an opportunity they will not get.	Dole ne a sami damar ba za su samu ba.
She said she understood.	Ta ce ta gane.
I paid to go to the movie without the kids.	Na biya kudi don in je kallon fim ɗin ba tare da yara ba.
I can sleep tomorrow, but that doesn't necessarily help.	Zan iya barci a gobe, amma hakan ba lallai ba ne ya taimaka.
There has never been such a thing.	Ba a taɓa samun irin wannan ba.
Give them a little time if they need to.	Ka ba su ɗan lokaci kaɗan idan suna bukata.
They said we needed help.	Suka ce muna bukatar taimako.
They were equal to each other.	Sun kasance daidai da juna.
You have a lot, let them join, now.	Kuna da yawa, bari su shiga, yanzu.
No wonder they didn't stop right.	Ba abin mamaki ba ne ba su tsaya dama ba.
This is a bit of a surprise.	Wannan wani ɗan mamaki ne.
I am a filmmaker, myself.	Ni dan fim ne, ni kaina.
We await, as he waits for us, for you.	Muna jira, kamar yadda ya jira mu, a gare ku.
First, stop trying to change them.	Da farko, daina ƙoƙarin canza su.
I did not go.	ban tafi ba.
They are not many, this is for sure.	Ba su da yawa, wannan tabbas ne.
Some time has passed.	Wani lokaci ya wuce.
I asked her what she wanted.	Na tambaye ta me take so.
So unwanted.	Don haka ba a so.
Maybe now.	Wataƙila a yanzu.
I want to be the person.	Ina so in zama mutumin.
Hurry up, too.	Yi sauri, kuma.
We have the first thing.	Muna da abu na farko.
I have no time though.	Ban da lokaci ko da yake.
A thought came to him at the time.	Wani tunani ya zo masa a lokacin.
He changed course.	Ya canza hanya.
But this is not always easy.	Amma hakan ba koyaushe yake da sauƙi ba.
But let's take a closer look at it.	Amma bari mu sake duba shi da kyau.
But he does not like me.	Amma ba ya so na.
This is what makes them the best.	Wannan shine abin da ya sa su zama mafi kyau.
She did her homework, although it was not a pleasant experience.	Ta yi aikin gida, duk da cewa ba abin jin daɗi ba ne.
I will not kill her.	Ba zan kashe ta ba.
Such a person does not simply take what he wants.	Mutum irin wannan ba zai ɗauki abin da yake so kawai ba.
But it is also important for you to learn to be cautious.	Amma kuma a gare ku ku koyi hankali.
It’s everyone around here.	Yana da kowa a kusa da nan.
It has always been that way.	Haka ya kasance kullum.
She did not understand anything.	Bata gane komai ba.
Or does he just not pay attention when you tell him something to do?	Ko kuma yana jin haka.
Too much for me, this time of year.	Ya yi mini yawa, wannan lokacin na shekara.
She doesn't want us to think she feels anything.	Ba ta son mu tunanin tana jin komai.
People do that.	Mutane suna yin haka.
Fear of my hearing.	Tsoron ji na.
And it is water after that.	Kuma ruwa ne bayan haka.
He decided not to try.	Ya yanke shawarar ba zai gwada ba.
What's next.	Menene na gaba.
You come highly recommended.	Ka zo sosai shawarar.
It allows us to do our best.	Yana ba mu damar yin mafi kyau.
But this is a mistake.	Amma wannan kuskure ne.
Go back again.	Koma baya kuma.
But what really surprised her was how she felt.	Amma abin da ya ba ta mamaki shi ne yadda take ji.
Anything, but everything, is too much for her.	Komai, amma komai, yayi mata yawa.
I think that could be about me.	Ina tsammanin hakan na iya zama game da ni.
It grows a lot.	Yana girma da yawa.
There is no world.	Babu wata duniya.
If not really don't worry.	Idan ba haka ba da gaske kada ku damu.
She never said that.	Ta taba cewa shi.
I need to talk to him.	Ina bukata in yi magana da shi.
He thought he was ready.	Yayi tunani ya shirya.
God loves me for myself.	Allah yana so na don kaina.
Times have changed for the better.	Lokaci ya canza don mafi kyau.
But let's give it a go.	Amma bari mu ba shi dama.
But because of illness, he was unable to walk.	Amma saboda rashin lafiya, ya kasa tafiya.
Do you think this is amazing?	Kuna ganin wannan abin ban mamaki?
It has been a common occurrence ever since. 	Magana ce ta kowa tun daga lokacin. 
There is no way that can happen.	Babu yadda hakan zai iya faruwa.
They say he is ahead.	Suka ce yana kan gaba.
Some kind of pain annoyed her.	Wani irin zafi ya bata mata rai.
You did not do things right.	Ba ku yi abubuwa daidai ba.
Everything is ready.	An shirya komai.
It allows you to do things.	Yana ba ku damar yin abubuwa.
She said she wanted to talk.	Ta fada tana son magana.
It was the greatest they had ever had.	Shi ne mafi girma da suka taɓa samu.
They know each other.	Sun san juna.
I know a lot.	Na san da yawa.
Remove it as quickly as you can.	Cire shi da sauri kamar yadda za ku iya.
He did not succeed.	Bai samu nasara ba.
But today you will get it.	Amma yau za ku samu.
He took it upon himself.	Ya dauka a kansa.
He can do anything.	Zai iya yin komai.
It has no help.	Ba shi da wani taimako.
I'm not sure it will help.	Ban tabbata zai taimaka ba.
At best not many people will know about me.	A mafi kyau ba mutane da yawa za su sani game da ni.
It is not as good as ever.	Ba shi da kyau kamar koyaushe.
Tomorrow will come.	Gobe ​​zai zo.
He forgot everything about her.	Ya manta da ita komai.
We must lose time.	Dole ne mu rasa lokaci.
You heard what we heard.	Kun ji abin da muka ji.
Years later people came back to this problem.	Shekaru da yawa bayan mutane sun dawo cikin wannan matsala.
There is a reason for this.	Akwai dalilin hakan.
This man knows nothing.	Wannan mutumin bai san komai ba.
I need to write a song	Ina bukata in rubuta waƙa
They left him.	Suka bar shi.
Is that correct ?.	Wannan daidai ne?.
I am on board.	Ina cikin jirgin.
You may be surprised yourself.	Kuna iya mamakin kanku.
I will cover it.	Zan rufe shi.
He is running slowly.	A hankali yake gudu.
The place is amazing.	Wurin yana da ban mamaki.
I will take the hardest.	Zan dauki mafi wuya.
It's kind of funny.	Wani irin ban dariya ne.
They do this before they do anything.	Suna yin haka kafin su yi wani abu.
I don't think she even knows.	Bana jin ta ma sani.
One woman and one house.	Mata daya da gida daya.
He has nowhere to go.	Babu inda zai je.
We entered through the front door.	Muka shiga ta kofar gida.
I got up just before my usual tomorrow morning to finish.	Na tashi tun kafin lokacin da na saba gobe da safe in gama.
I went and lived with him.	Na je na zauna da shi.
We are very happy.	Mun yi farin ciki sosai.
But that's what you want about it.	Amma abin da kuke so game da shi ke nan.
You do not have to do this.	Ba lallai ne ku yi hakan ba.
I don't want her to go.	Ba na son ta tafi.
Now, let's say "not necessarily."	A yanzu, bari mu ce "ba lallai ba ne."
That is what you said.	Abin da kuka ce ke nan.
That's why.	Shi ya sa.
It's raining a lot here.	Ana ruwan sama mai yawa a nan.
Do not use oil.	Kar a yi amfani da mai.
They said we had to go.	Suka ce dole mu tafi.
The two things go hand in hand.	Abubuwan biyu suna tafiya tare.
Everyone can see that.	Kowa na iya ganin haka.
I really don't know who he is.	A gaskiya ban san ainihin wanene shi ba.
Maybe you know me.	Wataƙila ka san ni.
They have forgotten, and they know.	Sun manta, kuma sun sani.
Over the years.	Tsawon shekaru.
One of us went.	Daya daga cikin mu ya tafi.
They would not have done it.	Da ma ba su yi ba.
I think running is not for me.	Ina tsammanin gudu ba nawa bane.
It requires a lot of things to work.	Yana buƙatar abubuwa da yawa don yin aiki.
He is just a man, but he will not do us any good.	Wannan mutum ne kawai, amma ba zai yi mana wani amfani ba.
I'd rather come up with something better.	Gara in fito da wani abu mai kyau.
Of course you want some money fast.	Tabbas kuna son wasu kuɗi da sauri.
It doesn’t come out much.	Ba ya fita da yawa.
We can use this to help you.	Za mu iya amfani da wannan don taimaka muku.
I think people will like it.	Ina tsammanin mutane za su so shi.
Many are just waiting.	Mutane da yawa suna jira kawai.
You drive fast.	Kuna tuƙi da sauri.
And he prefers to study and travel.	Kuma ya fi son karatu da tafiya.
And maybe they are right.	Kuma watakila suna da gaskiya.
It is difficult to write by hand.	Yana da wuya ta rubuta da hannu.
She helped me get up.	Ta taimake ni tashi.
He did not even raise his hand to me.	Bai ko d'aga min hannu ba.
And never lie again.	Kuma kada ku sake yin karya.
Of course, they can't do that.	Tabbas, ba za su iya yin hakan ba.
She knew from him.	Ta san daga gare shi.
There, you see.	Can, kun gani.
Please wait a while.	Da fatan za a tsaya na ɗan lokaci.
He returned home and passed away.	Ya dawo gida ya wuce.
Save until we get home.	Ajiye sai mun isa gida.
And it is sad.	Kuma abin bakin ciki ne.
Reading is a fun activity.	Karatu aiki ne mai daɗi.
They hit him, but he was injured.	Sun buga shi, amma sun ji rauni.
There's a lot to talk about.	Akwai mai da yawa game da.
In fact, they were willing to.	A gaskiya ma, sun kasance suna so.
It is a pleasure to watch.	Abin farin ciki ne a kula.
And sometimes they don't get there.	Kuma wani lokacin ba su isa wurin ba.
I'll take care of it, of course.	Zan kula da shi, ba shakka.
This may take some time, of course.	Wannan na iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci, ba shakka.
I think that increases the number of people.	Ina tsammanin hakan yana kara yawan mutane.
This seems to be more than a dog.	Wannan ya zama kamar ya zama fiye da kare.
I do not know what will happen next.	Ban san abin da zai faru a gaba ba.
Maybe I’ll just give it a go.	Wataƙila zan ba da shi kawai.
They see both from a mental perspective.	Suna ganin biyu daga kallon tunani.
As we are.	Kamar yadda muke.
But no one.	Amma babu wani.
But it seems more to me.	Amma ga alama fiye da haka a gare ni.
He began to run.	Ya fara gudu.
However, something else began to happen.	Duk da haka, wani abu kuma ya fara faruwa.
He told him who had and who was not.	Ya gaya masa wanda yake da wanda ba ya cikin jirgin.
He appears to just want more work and time.	Ya bayyana don kawai yana son ƙarin aiki da lokaci.
But now that the time has come, it is coming soon.	Amma yanzu da lokaci ya yi, yana zuwa da sauƙi.
I will not let you go.	Ba zan bar ku ku tafi ba.
Both at work and at home.	Duk a wurin aiki da kuma a gida.
You'll get to it tomorrow.	Za ku samu zuwa gobe.
Of course, that will never happen.	Tabbas hakan ba zai taba faruwa ba.
It is not enough.	Bai isa ba.
It will not come.	Ba za ta zo ba.
But we will talk.	Amma za mu yi magana.
I trust you, man.	Na yarda da kai, mutum.
I hope she is here.	Ina fatan ta kasance a nan.
Do not leave anyone behind.	Kada a bar kowa a baya.
Just your money, and that's it.	Kuɗin ku kawai, kuma shi ke nan.
We just want to get it.	Muna so kawai a samu.
So we went to the police station.	Shi ya sa muka je wurin ‘yan sanda.
I knew it would.	Na san zai yi.
On everyone.	Akan kowane mutum.
She is very tired.	Ta gaji sosai.
.	.
He is alive, even healthy.	Yana da rai, ko da lafiya.
People already know this.	Mutane sun riga sun san wannan.
I just did not understand.	Kawai ban gane ba.
It just happened there.	Ya faru ne kawai a can.
This time it takes.	Wannan lokacin yana ɗauka.
We could not answer, of course.	Ba mu iya ba da amsa ba, ba shakka.
And let's call that what it is.	Kuma bari mu kira wannan abin da yake.
So of course everyone will like it.	Don haka ba shakka kowa zai so shi.
I don't drink that much anymore.	Ba na sha da yawa haka kuma.
And, there will be more.	Kuma, za a sami ƙarin.
I did not, of course.	Ban yi ba, ba shakka.
He thought he would.	Ya dauka zai yi.
But it gives me that kind of pleasure.	Amma yana ba ni irin wannan jin daɗi.
It works well with it.	Yana da kyau aiki tare da shi.
It started to rain just as we were getting into it.	Ruwa ya fara yi a daidai lokacin da muka shiga ciki.
Many more will come to you.	Dama da yawa za su zo muku.
Maybe you want to stay.	Wataƙila kuna so ku zauna.
I used water.	Na yi amfani da ruwa.
She is.	Ita ce.
And we did.	Kuma mun yi.
This is the second time this has happened.	Wannan shi ne karo na biyu da hakan ke faruwa.
This is not like me.	Wannan ba kamar ni ba ne.
Can't remember what else.	Ba za a iya tuna me kuma.
She brought it here.	Ta kawo shi nan.
He cannot live for anyone.	Ba zai iya rayuwa ga kowa ba.
What she wants is sleep.	Abin da take so shi ne barci.
I grew up in a house.	Na girma a gidan.
She wants things to continue as they are.	Ta so abubuwa su ci gaba da tafiya yadda suke.
He will not answer.	Ba zai amsa ba.
Sometimes this comes in handy.	Wani lokaci hakan ya zo da amfani.
I lived with women and children.	Na zauna tare da mata da yara.
The house was amazing and had everything you needed.	Gidan ya kasance mai ban mamaki kuma yana da duk abin da ake bukata.
We will not be sure until we do.	Ba za mu tabbata ba sai mun yi .
I think that is good.	Ina ganin hakan yayi kyau.
This route goes from here to there.	Wannan hanya ta isa daga nan zuwa can.
They want to be together.	Suna son zama tare.
Start the program.	Fara shirin.
I do that.	Ina yin haka.
He said.	Ji ya ce.
It should be one.	Kamata yayi ya zama daya.
Trying to read for	Ƙoƙarin karatu don
It's so amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki sosai.
We are very smart.	Muna da hankali sosai.
She just cried.	Ta dan yi kuka.
We agreed to talk again in the morning.	Mun yarda mu sake magana da safe.
I was happy for them.	Na yi farin ciki da su.
Here is where he once lived.	Ga inda ya zauna sau ɗaya.
We need help.	Muna bukatar taimako.
He doesn’t do much right now.	Ba ya yin yawa a yanzu.
Here you go!	Ga ka!.
Sometimes there is nothing to say.	Wani lokaci babu abin da za a ce.
From now on he will take care of himself.	Daga yanzu zai kula da kansa.
But nothing.	Amma ba komai.
And how long you wait is hard.	Kuma tsawon lokacin da kuke jira yana da wahala.
I was called up before the first game was over.	An kira ni kafin a kare wasan farko.
We never played.	Ba mu taɓa yin wasa ba.
We still have work to do.	Har yanzu muna da aikin yi.
This moment is as it were.	Wannan lokacin na yanzu shine kamar yadda yake.
This is fine.	Wannan yana da lafiya.
This is very problematic.	Wannan yana da matukar matsala.
It made me hear it.	Ya sa na ji shi.
You have so many things to worry about right now.	Kuna da abubuwa da yawa da za ku damu da su yanzu haka.
The night before.	Da daren da ya gabata.
We are not alone.	Ba mu kadai ba.
Someone caught me.	Wani ya kama ni.
There are so many things to celebrate.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa don bikin.
He hopes it will be over soon.	Ya yi fatan za a kare da sauri.
Really good work.	Gaskiya yayi kyau aiki.
Everyone needs to play this.	Kowa yana buƙatar wasa wannan.
Do it twice.	Yi shi sau biyu.
Sometimes it works well.	Wani lokaci yana aiki da kyau.
The car stopped.	Motar ta tsaya.
She knew she had to hurry.	Ta san dole ta yi sauri.
Or, it looks like that.	Ko, haka yake kama.
You're in.	Kai na shiga.
I don’t know exactly what to do.	Ban san ainihin abin da zan yi ba.
Take something.	Dauki wani abu.
He kept opening the door.	Ya ci gaba da bude kofar.
I love my people.	Ina son mutane na.
This is a little more unusual.	Wannan ya fi ɗan sabon abu.
Maybe no one can help you.	Wataƙila babu wanda zai iya taimakon ku.
I can't understand this problem.	Ba zan iya gane wannan matsalar ba.
The coffee is hot.	Kofi ya yi zafi.
He does not want to leave the house.	Baya son barin gidan.
But it worked well for me.	Amma ya yi min aiki da kyau.
I was happy for them, and I was happy for us.	Na yi farin ciki a gare su, kuma na yi farin ciki a gare mu.
Of course I would advise you to do so.	Tabbas zan baka shawarar yin haka.
That was many years ago.	Hakan ya kasance shekaru da yawa da suka wuce.
Ask her how she feels about you.	Ka tambaye ta yadda take ji game da kai.
She writes during the day.	Ta kan rubuta da rana.
I hope you like it.	Ina fata kuna son shi.
And it worked.	Kuma ya yi aiki.
We continued.	Muka ci gaba.
Don't worry about getting through too much.	Kada ku damu da samun ta hanyar da yawa.
We will never go out.	Ba za mu taba fita ba.
They get what they want, whatever.	Suna samun abin da suke so, komai.
It was time for some people to get out of it.	Lokaci ya yi da wasu mutane suka fita daga ciki.
That night he was surprised.	A daren nan abin ya ba shi mamaki.
She has been to this day with all sorts of problems.	Ta kasance har zuwa yau da kowace irin matsala.
Another time he thought.	Wani lokaci kuma ya yi tunani.
This is the only way you can.	Wannan shine kawai hanyar da za ku iya.
This is a good one.	Wannan shi ne mai kyau.
He ran.	Ya gudu.
There is no problem with that.	Babu matsala tare da wannan.
He wants to keep things going.	Yana son ci gaba da abubuwa.
They do not hear us, man.	Ba sa jin mu, mutum.
We are looking for something that should not be here.	Muna neman abin da bai kamata ya kasance a nan ba.
Someone who definitely wants me dead.	Wani wanda tabbas yana son in mutu.
They do not grow very well.	Ba sa girma sosai.
That should be sufficient enough to start with.	Wannan ya isa mu fara.
I am a smart person	Ni mutum ne mai hankali
I have no way of fighting.	Ba ni da wata hanyar faɗa.
We weren’t right.	Ba mu kasance daidai ba.
So that is not the problem.	Don haka ba shine matsalar ba.
We didn't do anything to him.	Ba mu yi masa komai ba.
There will be.	Za a yi.
He is not in this house.	Ba a gidan nan ba ya.
I am not a human being.	Ni ba mutum ba ne.
Kill all fears.	Kashe duk tsoro.
I don't think he can.	Ban ce zai iya ba.
We are the ones we know.	Mu ne wanda muka sani.
I thought when that changed.	Na yi tunanin lokacin da ya canza.
Great enough.	Babban isa.
I always have something to say to her.	Kullum ina da abin da zan gaya mata.
Every time you leave the house.	Duk lokacin da ka bar gidan.
Whatever the man buys and sells, he gets money in it.	Duk abin da mutumin ya saya ya sayar, yana samun kuɗi a ciki.
He was ready to go.	Ya shirya ya tafi.
One year passed.	Shekara guda ta wuce.
I can't tell you to do this.	Ba zan iya gaya muku ku yi wannan ba.
You will not hear any of these things.	Ba za ku ji ko ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan ba.
I annoyed her.	Na bata mata rai.
On the day of the incident.	A ranar da abin ya faru.
I have a very nice home.	Ina da gida mai kyau sosai.
Everyone surprised me except her.	Kowa ya bani mamaki sai ita.
It rained a lot for the driver.	An yi ruwan sama da yawa don tuƙi.
But he is the best.	Amma ya fi kowa kyau.
Now it is necessary.	Yanzu abin bukata ne.
They do not want him to die.	Ba su so ya mutu.
He never touched us.	Bai taba mu ba.
It was a place we had never been to before.	Wuri ne da ba mu taɓa zuwa ba.
It is amazing today.	Yana da ban mamaki a yau.
But that's it.	Amma shi ke nan.
Would you like to hear it?	Kuna sha'awar jin shi?.
It is not a job.	Ba aiki ba ne.
They’re smart, but they’re right.	Suna da hankali, amma daidai suke.
We have to go back and look at that.	Dole ne mu koma mu duba hakan.
I honestly hate this guy.	Ni gaskiya na ƙi wannan mutumin.
They probably won't help.	Da alama ba za su taimaka ba.
Waiting for the world to live in peace.	Jiran duniya ta zauna lafiya.
He started to get up.	Ya fara tashi.
I was totally with them.	Na kasance gaba ɗaya tare da su.
I have been working with them for over a year now.	Na yi aiki da su sama da shekara guda yanzu.
It will catch.	Zai kama.
A smart person, or something.	Mutum mai hankali, ko wani abu.
Maybe it's night and not sleep.	Wataƙila dare ne ba barci ba.
This is especially true when it comes to travel.	Wannan gaskiya ne idan aka tafi.
It’s an amazing thing that you can get into.	Abu ne mai ban mamaki da za ku iya shiga ciki.
I bought some groceries yesterday.	Na sayi wasu kayan abinci jiya.
The others did the same.	Haka sauran su suka yi.
We must be together.	Dole ne mu kasance tare.
Please check back !.	Da fatan za a duba!.
He really did.	Ya yi da gaske.
Inside, you feel so happy all day !.	A ciki, kuna jin farin ciki sosai duk ranar!.
Whatever you do, do it with joy.	Duk abin da kuke yi, ku yi shi da farin ciki.
This is better.	Wannan ya fi kyau.
But sometimes she knows it's not a game.	Amma a wani lokaci ta san ba wasa ba ne.
In fact, he is no one but himself.	A gaskiya, ba kowa ba ne sai shi.
No one died.	Babu wanda ya mutu.
I'll wait for you outside.	Zan jira ku a waje.
It feels so good to play.	Yana jin dadi sosai don wasa.
You will tell me.	Za ku gaya mani.
I know I'm fine.	Na san lafiya.
She doesn’t sit on it right now.	Ba ta zauna a kansa ba a yanzu.
I'll put it there for the time being.	Zan sanya shi a can don lokacin.
Not all.	Ba duka ba.
How much is not so.	Nawa ba haka bane.
Ask about them.	Tambayi game da su.
This game knows a lot about me.	Wannan wasan ya san da yawa game da ni.
We will understand something.	Za mu gane wani abu.
I need to stay.	Ina bukata in zauna.
There must be a mistake.	Ina ganin an yi kuskure.
We love the house.	Muna son gidan.
We work outside the world.	Muna yin aiki a waje a duniya.
You are doing what they did.	Kuna yin irin abin da suka yi.
There is a head, and there is a hand.	Akwai kai, kuma akwai hannu.
It's one.	Daya ne.
The same is true of growing things.	Haka abin yake game da girma abubuwa.
I will not travel with you anymore.	Ba zan kara tafiya tare da ku ba yanzu.
Don't play games with me.	Kar a yi min wasa.
If not, stop there.	Idan ba haka ba, ka tsaya a can.
Or so it would be like.	Ko don haka zai zama kamar.
I will leave you with them.	Zan bar ku tare da su.
I love life as a whole.	Na son rai ne gaba ɗaya.
The seating area is comfortable.	Wurin zama abin mamaki yana da dadi.
He has not yet confirmed that.	Har yanzu bai tabbatar da hakan ba.
I will work to find out.	Zan yi aiki don gano hakan.
But she knew.	Amma ta sani.
I had a hard time.	Na yi wuya.
I do not understand anything.	Ban gane komai ba.
She still does not know.	Har yanzu bata sani ba.
It has made us bigger.	Ya kara mana girma.
With a few more.	Da wasu 'yan kadan.
The food is good.	Abincin yana da kyau.
Two of you come with me.	Biyu daga cikin ku zo tare da ni.
Maybe you should worry about that.	Wataƙila ya kamata ku damu da hakan.
The future was not for them.	Gaba ba ta kasance gare su ba.
It would not surprise me at all.	Ko kadan ba zai bani mamaki ba.
He is not sick to hear it himself.	Ba shi da lafiya ya ji shi da kansa.
He told me we could come.	Ya ce mani za mu iya zuwa.
Yet we learn from each other, always.	Duk da haka muna koyi da juna, ko da yaushe.
He still does.	Har yanzu yana yi.
He tried it a year later and failed again.	Ya gwada bayan shekara daya kuma ya sake kasa.
And it does not exist.	Kuma babu shi.
She lives in a nice house.	Tana zaune a gida mai kyau.
I do not know how to say it.	Ban san yadda zan fada ba.
So this would be the number one problem.	Don haka wannan zai zama matsala ta daya.
He can not swim.	Ba zai iya yin iyo ba.
I just have you.	Ina da ku kawai.
We got it.	Mun samu.
Still not ready for that.	Har yanzu bata shirya don haka ba.
Did you really travel?	Da gaske kun yi tafiya?
I hope they did too.	Ina fata su ma sun yi.
These are the two things you really have to pay attention to.	Waɗannan su ne guda biyu da gaske dole ku kula.
However, something caused him to doubt.	Duk da haka, wani abu ya sa ya yi shakka.
How are they?	Yaya irin su.
I can't leave it.	Ba zan iya barin shi ba.
Read more.	Karanta kuma.
He is here.	Yana nan a nan.
We will never leave.	Ba za mu taba barin ba.
Maybe not, 'she said.	Watakila a'a,' in ji ta.
He is not here.	Ba a nan yake ba.
I would not do such a thing.	Ba zan yi irin wannan abu ba.
But we have to figure out what we are getting into.	Amma dole ne mu gano abin da muke shiga.
As well as	Har da
Give it to him.	Ka bashi shi.
I'm doing really well.	Ina yin kyau sosai.
He was not sure he understood.	Bai tabbata ya gane ba.
Someone started talking about it.	Akan haka wani ya fara magana.
How are you now?	Kuna lafiya yanzu?
The man cried out to heaven.	Mutumin ya kira zuwa sama.
I'm sure both will do well.	Na tabbata duka biyu za su yi kyau.
Home and the world.	Gida da duniya.
You want to know more.	Kuna son ƙarin sani.
Many women have applied for the job.	Mata da yawa sun nemi wannan aikin.
But for her it was not so.	Amma a gare ta ba haka ba ne.
Give her everything, she can play.	Ka ba ta komai, tana iya wasa.
She raised her hand to him and he stood up.	Hannu ta daga masa ya tsaya.
He drank my coffee.	Ya sha kofi na.
Neglect.	Rashin kula.
Let's take a seat.	Mu dauki zama.
There is nothing right about that.	Babu wani abu daidai game da wannan.
Immediately he flew again.	Nan take aka sake tashi.
But this is where we made a mistake.	Amma a nan ne muka yi kuskure.
I don't want to be with you anymore.	Bana son in kara zama da ku.
It hurts.	Yana jin zafi.
A good name is everything !.	Kyakkyawan suna shine komai!.
But we can't find anyone who can prove it.	Amma ba za mu iya samun wanda ya tabbatar da hakan ba.
I know everyone is telling you this, but it really needs to happen.	Na san kowa yana gaya muku wannan, amma da gaske yana buƙatar faruwa.
You have everything.	Kuna da komai.
I don't have the money to pay for other things.	Ba ni da kuɗin da zan biya don wasu abubuwa.
Over and over.	A kan kuma a kan.
You can't go wrong.	Ba za ku iya yin kuskure ba.
You don't like this.	Ba ku son wannan.
That seems right.	Da alama hakan yayi daidai.
It still doesn't work.	Har yanzu baya aiki.
Once, someone recognized me.	Sau ɗaya, wani ya gane ni.
I never liked you.	Ban taba son ku ba.
And what is the plan after that? 	Kuma menene shirin bayan haka?
But they do not.	Amma ba sa.
I hope she does.	Ina fatan ta yi.
They laughed in the room.	Dariya suka saka a dakin.
Gradually it is difficult to do.	A hankali yana da wuya a yi.
I think someone came out in the background.	Ina ganin wani ya fita a baya.
But there is little for progress.	Amma akwai kaɗan kaɗan don ci gaba.
Not for work like that.	Ba don aiki irin wannan ba.
But someone is back there.	Amma akwai wanda ya dawo can.
You can't be there right now.	Ba za ku iya zama a can yanzu ba.
I hope you will.	Ina fatan za ku yi.
But they will not be there.	Amma ba za su kasance a can ba.
We don't care if you make the right decisions in life.	Ba mu damu da ku yanke shawarar da ta dace a rayuwa ba.
But it is something to be done.	Amma wani abu ne da za a yi.
The equipment will be inspected before purchase.	Za a duba kayan aikin kafin siyan su.
I think it is necessary.	Ina ganin ya zama dole.
It's not her thing.	Ba abin ta bane.
This is the way one will come to an end.	Wannan ita ce hanyar da mutum zai zo a ƙarshe.
You live here.	Kuna zaune a nan.
No need for more.	Babu buƙatar ƙarin.
Both died.	Biyu sun mutu.
But everyone knows only his own story.	Amma kowa ya san labarin kansa kawai.
This is for sure.	Wannan ya tabbata.
I suffered a lot.	Na sha wahala sosai.
It was good on the road to drowning himself to death, he thought.	Yana da kyau a hanya ya sha kansa ya mutu, ya yi tunani.
All the rest, enjoy doing so.	Duk sauran, jin daɗin yin haka.
I know it is.	Na san shi ne.
So, it is not expected that life will be possible.	Don haka, ba a tsammanin za a iya rayuwa ba.
You will not get out of this quickly.	Ba za ku ci gaba daga wannan ba da sauri.
We prepared everything for the trip.	Mun shirya komai don tafiya.
I can be anyone.	Zan iya zama kowa.
The door flew open.	Kofar ta tashi a bude.
That's it then.	Shi ke nan a lokacin.
You may have seen the past.	Wataƙila ka ga abin da ya gabata.
We will be there.	Za mu kasance a can.
And that's enough.	Kuma wannan ya isa haka.
But a problem arose.	Amma wata matsala ta bayyana.
You are truly amazing.	Kuna da ban mamaki da gaske.
I always refused to be serious.	Na ƙi zama da gaske koyaushe.
And it should.	Kuma ya kamata.
He never showed it to anyone.	Bai taba nuna kowa ba.
It's time to give it a try.	Lokaci na ne in gwada.
We want to do the right thing.	Muna so mu yi daidai.
He didn't seem to do much.	Da alama bai yi wani abu da yawa ba.
There is not much water.	Babu ruwa da yawa.
No answer.	Bata amsa ba.
Let's first look at their path.	Mu fara duba hanyar su.
Someone is talking.	Wani yana magana.
So nothing has changed.	Don haka babu abin da ya canza.
Few of us.	Kadan daga cikin mu.
I want him to go.	Ina so ya tafi.
He looked around the room.	Ya kalli dakin.
I took advantage of the opportunity.	Na yi amfani da damar.
We will find out everything there is to know about you.	Za mu gano duk abin da ke akwai don sanin ku.
But this water.	Amma wannan ruwa.
It does well.	Yana yi da kyau.
I'm not ready to get married yet.	Ban shirya yin aure ba tukuna.
In fact, a great thinker.	A gaskiya, babban ɗan tunani.
You are beautiful.	Kuna da kyau.
I'm tired of it.	Na gaji da shi.
Maybe it's time to change.	Wataƙila lokaci ya yi da za a canza.
But here are some things.	Amma sai ga wasu abubuwa.
They can’t just go and write it down.	Ba za su iya je kawai rubuta shi ba.
Nothing to do about it.	Babu abin yi game da shi.
We went on the road.	Muka tafi akan hanya.
They drink.	Suna sha.
He was seriously injured.	Ya samu mummunan rauni.
Yes you do.	Haka ne ku.
No, they say, you are doing a good job.	A'a, sun ce, kuna aiki mai kyau.
I work for you.	Ina yi mani aiki.
I tell people about it.	Ina gaya wa mutane game da shi.
He knows it too.	Shi ma ya san shi.
The story made her day.	Labarin ya sanya ranar ta.
You can't do it before or after.	Ba za ku iya yi kafin ko bayan haka ba.
We never did.	Ba mu taba yi ba.
They decide to fight.	Sun yanke shawarar yin fada.
We've had this before.	Mun sha kan wannan a baya.
We know it will rise again.	Mun san zai sake tashi.
Truth and way.	Gaskiya da hanya.
This is not about them.	Wannan ba game da su bane.
We hope you too !.	Muna fatan kai ma!.
No problem will come from that.	Babu wata matsala da za ta zo daga hakan.
They’re great for laughing, more often than not.	Suna da kyau don yin dariya, sau da yawa fiye da a'a.
For some, there is a lot of waiting around.	Ga wasu, akwai jira da yawa a kusa.
But it can also be real.	Amma shi ma yana iya zama da gaske.
You must remove it.	Dole ne ku cire shi.
I'll tell him he doesn't have to talk to me.	Zan ce masa ba sai ya yi min magana ba.
I will definitely go.	tabbas zan tafi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lokaci ya yi da zan yi da gaske.
We cover such a lot.	Mun rufe irin wannan da yawa.
They also know.	Sun kuma sani.
I can recognize him now.	Zan iya gane shi yanzu.
We asked you the first day.	Mun tambaye ku ranar farko.
It could be bigger.	Zai iya zama mafi girma.
You decide that enough is enough.	Kun yanke shawarar cewa isa ya isa.
Work will continue on this.	Za a ci gaba da aiki akan wannan.
Sometimes two carry one.	Wani lokaci biyu suna ɗaukar ɗaya.
Don't you think we need this?	Ba ku ganin muna bukatar wannan?
Nothing, until she can see.	Ba komai, har ta iya gani.
And he did it.	Kuma ya yi shi.
She knows now what will happen.	Ta san yanzu me zai faru.
But nothing will happen.	Amma babu abin da zai yi.
I have to buy one.	Dole in saya daya.
There are, however, other products available.	Akwai, duk da haka, wasu kayan da ake samu.
Another life is lost.	Wata rayuwa ta bata.
He is not interested in having a dog, of course.	Ba shi da sha'awar samun wani kare, ba shakka.
Money will be spent.	Za a kashe kudi.
Waiting is appropriate.	Jiran ya dace.
I can go to the game now.	Zan iya zuwa wasa yanzu.
No one knows who is behind it.	Babu wanda ya san wanda ke bayan sa.
Who owns it.	Wanene yake da shi.
They cannot succeed on the road.	Ba za su iya yin nasara a kan hanya ba.
It proved very difficult.	Ya tabbatar da wahala sosai.
Some are closed and some are open.	Wasu an rufe wasu kuma a bude.
I do not understand what the problem might be.	Ban gane menene matsalar zata iya zama ba.
And that is unlikely to happen.	Kuma da alama hakan ba zai faru ba.
Now the time is not right.	Yanzu lokaci bai yi daidai ba.
Although you will not get used to it.	Ko da yake ba za ku saba da shi ba.
This is a very difficult thing to do.	Wannan abu ne mai matukar wuya ya faru.
I want to say it is our time.	Ina so in ce lokacin mu ne.
Something failed, you died.	Wani abu ya kasa yin aiki, ka mutu.
Do not answer this.	Kar ka amsa wannan.
You can really.	Za ku iya gaske.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
It will be all right now.	Zai zama komai a yanzu.
She played a great game.	Ta buga babban wasan.
Slightly at the same time.	Kadan kadan a lokaci guda.
Of course not.	Ko shakka babu.
This is also good.	Wannan ma yana da kyau.
What they paid for.	Abin da suka biya shi.
Many daughters.	Ya'ya mata da yawa.
We were all amazing.	Mu duka mun kasance masu ban mamaki.
He did not agree.	Bai yarda ba.
Try not to worry.	Yi ƙoƙarin kada ku damu.
Don't do it.	Kar a yi shi.
Things will be as you know they will be.	Abubuwa za su kasance kamar yadda kuka san za su kasance.
A new job.	Wani sabon aiki.
I give him a job, show him.	Ina ba shi aiki, nuna masa.
I hope he still doesn’t care.	Ina fatan har yanzu bai damu ba.
So, he never told us anything.	Don haka, bai taɓa gaya mana komai ba.
So many people could not and did not.	Don haka mutane da yawa ba su iya ba kuma ba su yi ba.
I'm not even sure they used the money.	Ban tabbata ma sun yi amfani da kudi ba.
Believe me.	Ku yarda da ni,.
There is no way around that.	Babu wata hanya a kusa da hakan.
But it is something else.	Amma wani abu ne.
It was decided.	An yanke shawarar.
She never brought anything but already.	Bata taba kawo komai ba sai riga.
I asked him where?	Na tambaye shi a wane waje?
But look at these thoughts for what they are.	Amma duba ko da waɗannan tunani ga abin da suke.
Less, in fact.	Kadan, a gaskiya.
But it should.	Amma ya kamata.
To do it just because.	Don yin shi kawai saboda.
I am tired of being alone.	Na gaji da zama ni kaɗai.
Are you sick?	Ba ku da lafiya?
It seems to come from more than one person.	Kamar ya fito daga mutum fiye da ɗaya.
The room is not small.	Dakin ba kadan ba.
Admission is instantaneous.	Samun shiga ya kasance nan take.
She never said anything.	Bata taba cewa komai ba.
It is an opportunity that is rarely seen.	Wata dama ce da ba a saba gani ba.
At the time he was in school.	A lokacin yana makaranta.
He was definitely not there that day.	Lallai ba ya nan a ranar.
It is becoming increasingly clear.	Yana ƙara bayyana.
But not only that.	Amma ba haka kawai ba.
In the channel.	A cikin tashar.
Imagine you are in that boat.	Ka yi tunanin kana cikin wannan jirgin.
So, let’s agree not to agree on too many things.	Don haka, mu yarda kada mu yarda a kan abubuwa da yawa.
It will be the third ship.	Zai zama jirgin ruwa na uku.
When they use it.	Lokacin da suka yi amfani da shi.
No, go ahead if you want.	A'a, ci gaba idan kuna so.
But she was not beheaded.	Amma kuma ba a yanke mata kai ba.
I called them outside.	Na kira su waje.
I still haven't received an answer.	Har yanzu ban sami amsa ba.
It is a great time in life.	Lokaci ne mai girma a rayuwa.
I hope you are having a great time.	Ina fata kuna tafiya mai dadi.
I do not like that.	Ba na son hakan.
I could never catch her alone.	Ban taba iya kama ta ita kadai ba.
He tried to drink less than usual.	Ya gwada sha kasa da yadda ya saba.
Do not try to be like everyone else.	Kar ka yi ƙoƙarin zama kamar kowa.
This should not happen.	Wannan bai kamata ya faru ba.
Always late to the game.	Koyaushe a makara zuwa wasan.
The most interesting thing is the next.	Abu mafi ban sha'awa shine mai zuwa.
Maybe you will cry.	Wataƙila za ku yi kuka.
Life is not ahead of you.	Rayuwa ba ta gaba da ku ba.
I don’t think you want to get into this.	Bana tsammanin kuna son shiga cikin wannan.
Things seem to be going well in the end.	Da alama abubuwa sun yi kyau a ƙarshe.
But they did it really well.	Amma sun yi shi da gaske da kyau.
It is better to write others.	Gara ku rubuta wasu kuma.
I asked him about many people.	Na tambaye shi game da mutane da yawa.
The police were called.	An kira 'yan sanda.
He agreed to go.	Ya yarda ya tafi.
She would talk to him.	Zata yi masa magana.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
It will not be the first time this has happened to us.	Ba zai zama karo na farko da abin ya faru da mu ba.
But the world has changed.	Amma duniya ta canza.
I was very nervous about it all.	Na yi matukar jin tsoro game da duka.
He did not get out of the car.	Bata fito daga motar ba.
I'm honest, again.	Ina da gaskiya, sake.
Use the best of today.	Yi amfani da mafi kyawun yau.
So he will not fight.	Don haka ba zai yi fada ba.
He learned very quickly.	Ya koyi da sauri sauri.
I confirmed that.	Na tabbatar da hakan.
It happens all the time.	Yana faruwa kullum.
That will never happen today, he said.	Hakan ba zai taba faruwa a yau ba, in ji shi.
I don't want to give up anything.	Ba na son in daina komai.
No one will make me laugh anymore.	Babu wanda zai kara min dariya.
Look what is good.	Ku kalli abin da kyau.
Where are you.	Ina ku ke.
Honestly, let me go back.	A gaskiya, bari in koma baya.
Don’t miss any of your favorite moments.	Kada ku rasa kowane lokacin da kuka fi so.
So far as we know, no one.	Ya zuwa yanzu kamar yadda muka sani, babu wani.
Too much, too much.	Da yawa, da girma.
Don't pay attention to them.	Kada ku kula su.
And now they will try to come back to me.	Kuma yanzu za su gwada su dawo gare ni.
We have been in the house ever since.	Tun daga nan muna cikin gidan.
Everyone is waiting for you	Kowa yana jiran ku
When you do not have one, you cannot say you cannot succeed.	Lokacin da ba ku da ɗaya, ba za ku iya cewa ba za ku iya yin nasara ba.
They are a little late with this.	Sun dan makara da wannan.
However, that is correct.	Duk da haka, hakan yayi daidai.
We need to remember the past.	Muna bukatar mu tuna da baya.
They got the job done.	Sun samu aikin.
But they should not know that.	Amma bai kamata su san haka ba.
Then the mouth closed.	Sai bakin ya rufe.
He had to stop this or something happened.	Dole ne ya daina wannan ko wani abu ya faru.
I do not want to know the age.	Ba na son sanin shekaru.
Which shouldn’t surprise me.	Wanda bai kamata ya bani mamaki ba.
It's true.	Gaskiya ne.
Yes, he knew he had to remember, but he failed.	Haka ne, ya san ya kamata ya tuna, amma ya kasa.
That probably won't be there.	Wataƙila hakan ba zai kasance a can ba.
They all heard but did not speak.	Duk sun ji amma ba su yi magana ba.
This can be useful for that.	Wannan zai iya zama da amfani ga hakan.
I bring you something.	Na kawo muku wani abu.
He said he was fine.	Yace lafiya.
I didn’t start it.	Ban fara shi ba.
This is not about me.	Wannan ba game da ni ba ne.
She could not tell anyone what she had seen.	Ta kasa gaya wa kowa abin da ta gani.
I'm afraid it's not over.	Ina jin tsoro bai kare ba.
This shows that.	Wannan yana nuna cewa .
She is crying.	Tana kuka.
He came close.	Ya zo kusa.
Show me it!	Nuna min shi!
One or two days, that's it.	Kwana ɗaya ko biyu, ke nan.
I had to study hard.	Dole na yi karatu sosai.
The method was successful and had no problems.	Hanyar ta yi nasara kuma ba ta da matsala.
She was a big hobby for me, though.	Ta kasance babban abin sha'awa a gare ni, ko da yake.
The game is over.	Wasan ya kare.
You need to move on.	Kuna buƙatar ci gaba.
I do not need.	Bana bukata.
We can not do it.	Ba za mu iya yi ba.
The man is winning.	Mutumin yana cin nasara.
Bring it.	Kawo shi.
Much can be done.	Da yawa za a iya yi.
It should not be too difficult.	Bai kamata ya zama da wahala sosai ba.
This is the right time to buy a home.	Wannan shine lokacin da ya dace don siyan gida.
Think what you want.	Yi tunanin abin da kuke so.
You have a kid outside he needs you.	Kuna da yaro a waje yana buƙatar ku.
A favorite with women.	A fi so tare da mata.
It was late at night.	Nan take dare yayi.
Which is not very good.	Wanda ba shi da kyau sosai.
I know how it makes you feel.	Na san yadda yake sa ku ji.
You wear whatever you want.	Kuna sa duk abin da kuke so.
In a few years we will not be.	A cikin 'yan shekaru ba za mu kasance ba.
She became aware of him.	Sai ya zama ta san ta.
No, it is not.	A'a, ba haka ba ne.
But let me tell you, it was the best.	Amma bari in gaya muku, shine mafi kyau.
Play and watch.	Wasa kuma duba .
I love your work.	Ina sha'awar aikin ku.
Maybe we don't pay much attention.	Wataƙila ba mu kula sosai ba.
We are working together here.	Muna aiki tare a nan.
But not for me.	Amma ba a gare ni ba.
They thought he would win the game.	Sun yi tsammanin zai yi nasara a wasan.
Participation is voluntary.	Shiga na son rai ne.
You are the second person you see dead.	Kai ne mutum na biyu da ka ga ta mutu.
But we can't talk, we all know that very well.	Amma ba za mu iya magana ba, duk mun san haka sosai.
He hopes this.	Ya yi fatan wannan.
Until they make a name for themselves.	Har sai sun yi suna.
No one should buy this.	Babu wanda ya isa ya sayi wannan.
She should be crying.	Ta kamata tana kuka.
I would agree with that.	Zan yarda da haka.
Probably nothing.	Wataƙila ba komai ba ne.
I can't enjoy you tonight.	Ba zan iya jin daɗin ku a daren nan ba.
There is almost nothing we can do.	Kusan babu abin da za mu iya yi.
He was very smart.	Ya kasance mai hankali sosai.
I could not.	ban iya ba.
He also knows me well.	Shi ma ya san ni da kyau.
Or you are, how.	Ko kuma kun kasance, ta yaya.
He did not know.	Bai sani ba.
I should be able to do that.	Ya kamata in iya yin hakan.
Whenever they get it.	Duk lokacin da suka samu.
He returned home but continued to be in severe pain.	Ya koma gida amma ya ci gaba da jin zafi sosai.
After that, however, nothing was done.	Bayan haka, duk da haka, ba a yi komai ba.
That's what he wanted.	Abin da ya so ke nan.
He just wants the best for me.	Yana so kawai mafi kyau a gare ni.
They are no longer in it.	Ba su kasance cikin sa ba kuma.
It’s hard not to do that sometimes, though.	Yana da wuya kada a yi hakan wani lokaci, ko da yake.
I told myself that you really don’t care about me.	Na gaya wa kaina cewa da gaske ba ka damu da ni ba.
It’s just true for her.	Gaskiya ne kawai a gare ta.
That made him cry for all the right things.	Hakan ya sa shi yin kuka don duk abin da ya dace.
This is a fun thing to do in the movie.	Wannan abu ne mai daɗi a yi a fim ɗin.
The work is not written.	Ba a rubuta aikin ba.
But of course you want to change it before the game is released.	Amma tabbas kuna son canza shi kafin a fito da wasan.
In fact, it is better to wait.	A gaskiya ma, gara a jira.
It will be about two months.	Zai kasance kamar wata biyu.
They stayed until we started.	Suka zauna har muka fara.
He immediately felt ill.	Nan da nan ya ji rashin lafiya.
I do not hear them.	Ba na jin su.
I worked.	Na yi aiki.
He walked slowly.	Ya kara tafiya a hankali.
It is the right thing to do.	Abu ne da ya dace a yi.
I watched as others were driving, which helped me.	Na kalli yadda wasu suke tuƙi, wanda ya taimaka mini.
So they are not the same.	Don haka ba su daya ba.
Everyone does.	Kowane mutum yana yi.
This thing is cold.	Wannan abu yayi sanyi.
No one showed up.	Babu wanda ya nuna.
How do you know what a dog will do.	Ta yaya ka san abin da kare zai yi.
I want everyone to like.	Ina so kowa ya so.
It's not about happiness.	Ba game da farin ciki ba.
Now tell me more.	Yanzu ka ƙara gaya mani.
We’ve played a lot there over the years.	Mun yi wasa da yawa a can tsawon shekaru.
Not new.	Ba sabon ba.
Go to work.	Je zuwa aiki.
That's the big deal.	Babban abu ke nan.
Truth.	Gaskiya.
But this is not about what they want.	Amma wannan ba game da abin da suke so ba ne.
He loves me.	Yana son ni.
They can fly!	Za su iya tashi!
Boating is easier than swimming.	Jirgin ruwa ya fi sauƙi fiye da yin iyo.
I don't care about them.	Ban damu da su ba.
I am more than happy to pay.	Na fi farin cikin biya.
It will be sunny tomorrow, but cold.	Za a yi rana gobe, amma sanyi.
I have one last thing to ask you.	Ina da abu na ƙarshe da zan tambaye ku.
Of course she knew.	Tabbas ta sani.
I knew her at the same time.	Na san ta a lokaci guda.
I can't change this here.	Ba zan iya canza wannan a nan ba.
You will be added at the end of the session.	Za a ƙara ku a lokacin ƙarshe.
I do not know.	Ban sani ba.
But the problem is there.	Amma matsalar tana nan.
I would not do this otherwise.	Ba zan yi wannan in ba haka ba.
I did not do well in school.	Ban yi kyau a makaranta ba.
It's up to me.	Yana daga cikin ni.
You can't see that.	Ba za ku iya ganin wannan ba.
He has no interest in me.	Bata da sha'awa a kaina.
The eldest died quickly.	Babban ya mutu da sauri.
I'll wait at the train station.	Zan jira a tashar jirgin kasa.
I raise my hand.	Na daga hannu.
He spoke to me.	Yayi min magana.
This should not be surprising.	Wannan bai kamata ya zama abin mamaki ba.
The plane took off for the third time.	Jirgin ya tashi daga kasa a karo na uku.
So they look alike.	Don haka suna kama da gaba ɗaya.
I can't think of anything to say.	Ba zan iya tunanin wani abu da zan ce ba.
That's why they are so big.	Shi ya sa suke da girma.
He did not return.	Bai dawo ba.
We do everything here.	Muna yin komai a nan.
It was raining.	Ruwan sama ya zo bakin aiki.
Everyone knows us.	Kowa ya san mu.
I used to hope this.	Na kasance ina fata wannan.
It was all fought hand in hand.	An yi duk fada hannu da hannu.
I need you to tell me you are human now.	Ina bukata ka gaya mani kai mutum ne a yanzu.
He gave a signal.	Ya ba da alama.
This will be a happy day.	Wannan zai zama ranar jin daɗi.
She found she did not need much food or sleep.	Ta ga ba ta buƙatar abinci da yawa ko barci.
I learned from her.	Na yi koyi da ita.
This is something new.	Wannan sabon abu ne.
It just happens every month for a year.	Kawai ya faru kowane wata har tsawon shekara guda.
I will talk to him.	Zan yi magana da shi.
It has to be.	Dole ne ya kasance.
He hit, but there was no answer.	Ya buga, amma babu amsa.
If he does not know, he will not know.	Idan bai sani ba, ba zai sani ba.
I can't do this.	Ba zan iya yin wannan ba.
To me it seemed like a lot of fun.	A gare ni ya zama kamar ban sha'awa sosai.
Take advantage of opportunities.	Yi amfani da damar.
I was told they had been repaired since.	An gaya min an gyara su tun lokacin.
Drink does it for him.	Abin sha yayi masa haka.
If you see something, put it here.	Idan kun ga wani abu, saka shi a nan.
I didn’t work with it.	Ban yi aiki da shi ba.
Stop talking.	Tsaya magana.
Something that certainly did not surprise us.	Wani abu da babu shakka bai ba mu mamaki ba.
We must identify the real factors that led us to this decision.	Dole ne mu gano ainihin abubuwan da suka kai mu ga wannan shawarar.
Maybe people are really happy for you.	Wataƙila mutane suna yi maka farin ciki da gaske.
I don't think he will be back until tomorrow.	Bana jin zai dawo sai gobe.
I work tonight.	Ina aiki a daren yau.
So off they went.	Sai suka tafi.
Let them weep.	Su yi kuka.
We don't like that.	Ba ma son wannan.
I know he did it for me.	Na san ya yi min.
But it is not worldly.	Amma ba abin duniya ba ne.
For the day.	Don ranar.
We drink fresh water.	Muna shan ruwa mai dadi.
Talking is hard.	Magana tana da wuya.
We can recommend this place to everyone.	Za mu iya ba da shawarar wannan wuri ga kowa da kowa.
We should wait here and call for help.	Ya kamata mu jira a nan mu kira taimako.
But he heard what was happening.	Amma ya ji abin da ke faruwa.
Suddenly, she felt useful.	Nan da nan, ta ji amfani.
Never do it.	Kada ku taɓa yin shi.
Before you go you will decide what to do with me.	Tun kafin ku tafi za ku yanke shawarar abin da za ku yi da ni.
A car collides with a bus.	Wata mota ta yi karo da wata bas.
No one wrote it.	Babu wanda ya rubuta shi.
She will not return.	Ba za ta dawo ba.
In the third way.	A hanya ta uku.
Users help other users.	Masu amfani suna taimaka wa wasu masu amfani.
Maybe this is why it is so difficult.	Wataƙila wannan shine dalilin da ya sa yana da wuya.
Still, nothing to worry about.	Har yanzu, babu abin da zai damu.
Do you just do them.	Shin kuna yin su ne kawai.
It is good to have a car again.	Yana da kyau a sake samun mota.
Read this book, and re-read it.	Karanta wannan littafin, kuma a sake kama shi.
It happens often.	Yana faruwa sau da yawa.
It is a real home away from home.	Gida ne na gaske daga gida.
The journey is carefully planned.	An shirya hanyar tafiya a hankali.
This method makes it easy to reuse.	Wannan hanya ta sa sake yin amfani da ita cikin sauƙi.
He accepted them.	Ya yarda da su.
So, do not answer.	Don haka, kar ku amsa.
Imagine if he didn’t have me.	Ka yi tunanin idan ba shi da ni.
We really hope so.	Muna fatan gaske.
We are not police.	Mu ba 'yan sanda ba ne.
Focus on how you feel and what you like.	Mai da hankali kan yadda kuke ji da abin da kuke so.
It's as sick as any.	Yana da yawa rashin lafiya kamar kowane.
This is where they will wait.	A nan ne za su jira.
I can't see this working.	Ba zan iya ganin wannan ya yi aiki ba.
The school can use great intelligence too.	Makaranta na iya amfani da hankali sosai kuma.
It was raining and we came back from dinner that day.	Ana ruwan sama muka dawo daga abincin dare a ranar.
Simple and comfortable.	Mai sauƙi da jin dadi.
I always enjoy when you stop.	Kullum ina jin daɗin lokacin da kuka tsaya.
You can not wait.	Ba za ku iya jira ba.
The film is beautiful, stunning, and thrilling.	Fim ɗin yana da kyau, ban mamaki, kuma mai ban sha'awa.
This is a great help in the future.	Wannan yana da babban taimako a nan gaba.
You have to do everything.	Dole ne ku yi komai.
I may have a second thought later.	Zan iya samun tunani na biyu daga baya.
She explained the problem to him.	Ta bayyana masa matsalar.
No, it is not.	A'a, ba haka ba.
So we want you to stay with us for a while.	Don haka muna son ku zauna tare da mu na ɗan lokaci.
This, however, is the simplest.	Wannan, duk da haka, shine mafi sauƙi.
Police have not yet confirmed the identity of the suspect.	Har yanzu ‘yan sanda ba su tabbatar da ainihin wanda ake zargin ba.
And if you know us, you know that.	Kuma idan kun san mu, kun san haka.
I know how to do it.	Na san yadda za a yi.
I can't work with this person.	Ba zan iya yin aiki da wannan mutumin ba.
He used to tell me a lot.	Ya kasance yana gaya mani da yawa.
I think they can.	Ina tsammanin za su iya.
Maybe, though, he doesn’t know.	Wataƙila, ko da yake, bai sani ba.
No child was injured.	Babu wani yaro da ya samu rauni.
Finally, it happens.	A ƙarshe, yana faruwa.
I recommend you do this as soon as possible.	Ina ba da shawarar ku yi haka da sauri.
God is saying.	Allah yana cewa.
If they have, ask how much.	Idan suna da, tambayi nawa.
I have never been around kids.	Ban taba zama a kusa da yara ba.
I tried it and it definitely works.	Na gwada shi kuma tabbas yana aiki.
And not just for her, but for myself.	Kuma ba don ita kaɗai ba, amma don kaina.
They said they would continue to walk.	Sun ce za su ci gaba da tafiya.
Of course people love work and food.	Tabbas mutane suna son aiki da abinci.
One or the other appeared at the door.	Daya ko daya ya bayyana a bakin kofar.
They must succeed.	Dole ne su yi nasara.
Even by the way.	Ko da ta hanyar.
And still difficult.	Kuma har yanzu wahala.
I'll get there eventually.	Zan isa can a ƙarshe.
I think people should try it.	Ina ganin ya kamata mutane su gwada shi.
It is something that never happened.	Wani abu ne da bai faru ba.
I will not go.	ba zan je ba.
He sleeps more than he eats.	Yana barci ya fi ci abinci.
Plaintiff.	Mai kara.
It's about opportunity.	Yana da game da damar.
I have become so human.	Na zama haka mutum.
I never really read it.	Ban taba karanta shi da gaske ba.
They must love it.	Dole ne su so shi.
I do not know how we do.	Ban san yadda muke yi ba.
I'll be back .	Zan dawo .
The killer was never arrested.	Ba a taba kama wanda ya kashe shi ba.
You have to work with me.	Dole ne ku yi aiki tare da ni.
I saw that she did not trust me.	Na ga ba ta yarda da ni ba.
So it's good.	Don haka yana da kyau.
However, this is difficult to do at all.	Duk da haka, wannan yana da wuya a yi gaba ɗaya.
I think the previous one was good.	Ina tsammanin wanda ya gabata yana da kyau.
I closed it.	Na rufe ta.
He is still alive.	Har yanzu bai mutu ba.
This will help a lot.	Wannan zai taimaka sosai.
He told me one night at a restaurant.	Ya ce da ni wani dare a wurin cin abinci.
No one will touch me.	Ba wanda zai taba ni.
Let him stand there.	Bari ya tsaya a can.
They will not be what you think they are.	Ba za su zama wanda kuke tunani ba.
Is that so.	Haka ne.
This will not hurt.	Wannan ba zai yi rauni ba.
I should stop now.	Ya kamata in daina yanzu.
I know exactly what you are trying to pick up.	Na san ainihin abin da kuke ƙoƙarin ɗauka.
Maybe not.	Watakila kasa .
It was kind of helpful, it worked for me.	Yana da irin taimako, yana aiki a gare ni.
And no one knows where he is.	Kuma ba wanda ya san inda yake.
I can not understand how.	Ba zan iya gane yadda.
He kept getting up.	Ya ci gaba da tashi.
I feel like it's flying high.	Ina jin yana tashi sama.
In the best way, of course.	A hanya mafi kyau, ba shakka.
Start as usual.	Fara kamar yadda aka saba.
He wants to be able to touch her as he pleases.	Yana son samun dama ya taba ta yadda ya ga dama.
Police, man.	'Yan sanda, mutum.
I had to stay for a while.	Sai da na zauna na dan wani lokaci.
They won't tell me anything about it.	Ba za su gaya mani komai game da shi ba.
Reading would be amazing.	Karatu zai zama abin ban mamaki.
He called and spoke to her.	Ya kira ya yi magana da ita.
You know what to do.	Kun san abin da dole ne a yi.
On board.	A kan jirgin.
For a while she felt so much better.	Cikin d'an lokaci ta ji dad'i sosai.
so, so, so !.	so, so, so!.
We can do both.	Za mu iya yin duka biyu.
That was never good.	Hakan bai taba kyau ba.
I killed him and he worked.	Na kashe shi kuma ya yi aiki.
They fly high in the sky.	Suna tashi sama sama.
This has been very interesting.	Wannan ya kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
But it was too late.	Amma ya makara.
He seems to have suffered.	Da alama ya sha wahala.
This is another one.	Wannan wani ne.
Only after two in the morning.	Sai bayan biyu na safe.
They stopped at the side of the road.	A bakin hanya suka tsaya.
I can take care of myself.	Zan iya kula da kaina.
However, he did not think so.	Duk da haka, bai yi tunani ba.
Just, what are you doing to me.	Kawai, me kuke yi min.
I went to see.	Na je na gani.
You do not have to take everything here.	Ba lallai ne ku ɗauka komai a nan ba.
Last eater.	Mai ci na ƙarshe.
He fell into debt.	Ya fada cikin bashi.
It's not good.	Bai yi kyau ba.
Study hard and you will get a good job.	Yi karatu sosai kuma za ku sami aiki mai kyau.
It looks like.	Ya yi kama.
I doubt they will be kept together.	Ina shakka ko za a ajiye su tare.
But we also want to be changed.	Amma mu kuma muna so a canza mu.
She is in all of us.	Tana cikin mu duka.
I found this very useful !.	Na sami wannan yana da amfani sosai!.
Everything must have been there and now it is.	Dole ne komai ya kasance a wurin kuma yanzu ya kasance.
A movie was made about it.	An yi fim game da shi.
Good fun, but also no money involved.	Kyakkyawan jin daɗi, amma kuma babu kuɗi da hannu.
What a surprise !.	Abin mamaki!.
We know nothing.	Ba mu san komai ba.
As it is.	Kamar yadda yake.
It’s never too late to be what you probably are.	Ba ya makara don zama abin da wataƙila ka kasance.
He felt he was making a mistake.	Ya ji yana jin kuskure.
Time will tell.	Lokaci zai nuna akan haka.
I read about them.	Na karanta game da su.
It comes from us.	Ya zo daga gare mu.
Everything purchased was sold.	Duk abin da aka saya aka sayar.
It contradicts everything.	Ya saba wa komai.
It is better to forget who it is.	Gara a manta wanda ya kasance.
How much, however, is unknown.	Nawa, duk da haka, ba a sani ba.
I could never take it.	Ba zan taɓa iya ɗaukar shi ba.
It's good inside.	Yana da kyau a ciki.
I am happy about that.	Na yi farin ciki a kan hakan.
But we must stand by him.	Amma ya kamata mu tsaya masa.
I did not pay attention to it.	Ban kula shi ba.
We don't want to kill him.	Ba ma so mu kashe shi.
We feel something fishy.	Muna jin wani abu mai kifi.
But let's keep it up.	Amma mu ci gaba da shi.
Or, after a while, he starts to get sick.	Ko kuma, bayan wani ɗan lokaci, ya fara yin rashin lafiya.
So, about food.	Saboda haka, game da abinci.
And everything will be fine.	Kuma komai zai yi kyau.
It will take us about two to three days to get there.	Zai kai mu kamar kwana biyu zuwa uku kafin mu isa wurin.
Nothing right now.	Ba komai yanzu.
Just remember.	Ka tuna kawai.
He was never the same as me.	Bai taba zama daidai da ni ba.
Had she had one fight.	Da ta yi fada guda daya.
This is about to work.	Wannan ya kusa yin aiki.
That may be true.	Hakan na iya zama gaskiya.
They come from money, it does not.	Suna zuwa daga kudi, ba ya yi.
He did not say much to her about it.	Bai mata magana da yawa akan hakan ba.
Somewhere I will give you this advice.	Wani wuri zai ba ku wannan shawarar.
Work for someone else.	Yi aiki ga wani.
We must find a way.	Dole ne mu nemi wata hanya.
It's still all there.	Har yanzu duk yana nan.
It is a great tool.	Yana da babban kayan aiki.
But you will not enter.	Amma ba za ku shiga ba.
Now, the project is scheduled to begin next year.	Yanzu, ana shirin fara aikin a shekara mai zuwa.
And tell everyone what to do and how to do it.	Kuma ka gaya wa kowa abin da zai yi da yadda za a yi.
We must go!	Dole ne mu tafi!
You do not have much time.	Ba ku da lokaci mai yawa.
He doubted carefully.	Ya yi shakka a hankali.
Continue your story.	Ci gaba da labarin ku.
Why did he come?	Me yasa ya zo?
Is she talking to me? 	Tana magana ni ne?
It takes her up to heaven.	Yana kai ta sama.
It looks good inside.	Ya yi kyau a ciki.
Not many, but some.	Ba yawa, amma wasu.
But it didn't do very well.	Amma bata yi kyau sosai ba.
We didn't really talk.	Ba mu yi magana da gaske ba.
Be honest, give it a try.	Yi gaskiya, gwada gaske.
I know it's amazing.	Na san abin mamaki ne.
It costs a lot of money.	Yana kashe kuɗi da yawa.
We like it very much.	Muna son shi da kyau.
That is the only work.	Wannan shine kawai aikin.
We never thought about leaving school, he said.	Ba mu taba tunanin barin makaranta ba, in ji shi.
So no wonder they were scared around him.	Don haka ba mamaki sun ji tsoro a kusa da shi.
You agree.	Kun yarda da shi.
I think that's right.	Ina ganin hakan yayi daidai yadda yakamata.
I never knew that.	Ban taba sanin haka ba.
And you are the greatest.	Kuma kai ne abin da ya fi girma.
But no one answered.	Amma babu wanda ya amsa.
It is the first.	Na farko ne.
And you have to accept the truth.	Kuma dole ne ku yarda da gaskiya.
Hopefully you will do what you can.	Da fatan za ku yi abin da za ku iya.
Get up there.	Tashi zuwa can.
I have always been such a person.	A koyaushe na kasance irin wannan mutumin.
Could that be true?	Shin hakan zai iya zama gaskiya?.
Moreover, really.	Haka kuma, da gaske.
I feel like my arm has been amputated.	Ina ji kamar an yanke hannu.
When you have the time of course.	Lokacin da kuke da lokacin ba shakka.
It is exactly what you really are.	Daidai ne na ainihin ku.
It's hard to be.	Yana da wuya ya kasance.
I'm even interested in it.	Ina ma sha'awar shi.
I was there to see the growth.	Na kasance don ganin girma.
It is a lie.	Wata karya ce.
But apparently no one can tell me.	Amma da alama babu wanda zai iya gaya mani.
What happened can happen again.	Abin da ya faru na iya sake faruwa.
He is also the owner.	Shi ma mai shi da hannu.
Tell us so.	Fada mana haka.
Whether true or false.	Komai gaskiya ko karya.
So it was.	Haka ma haka abin ya kasance.
It's a good thing.	Abu ne mai kyau.
And we would like to stay there.	Kuma za mu so mu zauna a wurin.
I paused for a moment and did not know what to do.	Na dan tsaya dan ban san me zan yi ba.
You have to make an effort to make it happen.	Dole ne ku yi ƙoƙari don ganin hakan ta faru.
And he returned.	Kuma ya koma.
The stomach is cold.	Ciki yayi sanyi.
Make the world a better place.	Sanya duniya wuri mafi kyau.
He fell on his head.	Ya yi kasa a kansa.
They will get out of your way.	Za su fita daga hanyar ku.
We are glad to hear the news.	Mun yi farin ciki da jin labarin.
We are not going to go there.	Ba za mu je can ba.
But what he wants is something else.	Amma abin da yake so shi ne wani abu kuma.
He just went.	Kawai sai ya tafi.
And he could not find it.	Kuma ya kasa gano shi.
No one can tell this.	Ba wanda zai iya gaya wa wannan.
He quickly ate.	Da sauri ya ci.
He was the second kid we saw.	Shi ne yaro na biyu da muka gani.
But this is interesting.	Amma wannan yana da ban sha'awa.
They will not stop growing.	Ba za su daina girma ba.
This person knows how to work.	Wannan mutumin ya san yadda ake aiki.
I know the place inside.	Na san wurin a ciki.
But really.	Amma da gaske.
Besides, it was night.	Ban da haka, dare ne.
Make sure that	Tabbatar cewa
I can't take it anymore.	Na kasa ɗauka kuma.
It's nothing.	Ba komai ba ne.
So let me say that we have two thoughts.	Don haka bari in ce muna da tunani guda biyu.
If you want to make a movie, you should love this movie.	Idan kuna son yin fim, ya kamata ku so wannan fim ɗin.
I began to help myself.	Na fara taimakon kaina.
Coming this way.	Zuwa ta wannan hanya.
He is not coming.	Ba ya zuwa.
We will use this material.	Za mu yi amfani da wannan kayan.
Great man.	Babban mutum.
Not you.	Ba kai bane.
When it comes together it is good.	Idan ya zo tare yana da kyau.
I will do it.	Zan yi shi.
Of course it looks very interesting.	Tabbas yayi kama da ban sha'awa sosai.
Now take a moment to take care of that person.	Yanzu ɗauki ɗan lokaci don kula da wannan mutumin.
She tells you what to do.	Ta gaya maka me za ka yi.
Not so, it turns out.	Ba ma haka ba, ya zama gaskiya.
No more checks.	Bata kara duba ba.
No, it has to be right.	A'a, dole ne ya zama daidai.
He was an abomination.	Ya kasance abin ƙi.
That's what it is.	Abin da yake da shi ke nan.
People are watching you.	Mutane suna kallon ku.
Some are rejected because they are bad.	Wasu ana ƙi su saboda ba su da kyau.
Today is the third day.	Yau kwana uku ke nan.
I like this house	Ina son wannan gidan
So he said.	Don haka ya ce.
As expected, one policeman walked away.	Kamar yadda aka zata, dan sanda daya yayi tafiya.
This request is unreasonable.	Wannan buƙatar ba ta dace ba.
I do not care what you think.	Ban damu da me kuke tunani ba.
She felt she could say anything.	Ta ji za ta iya cewa komai.
He has been amazing so far.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki ya zuwa yanzu.
They are cut off.	An yanke su.
The house was a development project.	Gidan ya kasance aikin ci gaba ne.
So off he went.	Don haka ya tashi tafiya.
And it is not difficult to explain.	Kuma ba shi da wuya a bayyana.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
Or many other things.	Ko wasu abubuwa da yawa.
He must have been happy that night.	Tabbas ya yi farin ciki a wannan daren.
It grows fast.	Yayi girma da sauri.
There are so many interesting people out there.	Akwai mutane masu ban sha'awa da yawa a can.
That makes me sad.	Hakan yana bani bakin ciki.
They met at the station.	Sun hadu a tashar.
There is no way right there.	Babu hanya dama can.
There are things we can do now that can help.	Akwai abubuwan da za mu iya yi a yanzu da za su iya taimaka.
The more you do this, the better you will get.	Yawan yin wannan, mafi kyawun za ku samu.
The house is empty.	Gidan babu kowa.
And that's what you should do.	Kuma abin da ya kamata ku yi ke nan.
When do we eat?	Yaushe muke ci?
At the same time the focus will be on.	A lokacin kuma mai da hankali zai faru.
There is no way to explain it.	Babu wata hanya ta bayyana shi.
Maybe look back next year.	Wataƙila duba baya shekara ta gaba.
I really enjoyed it.	Na ji daɗi sosai.
I did not hear that.	Ban ji haka ba.
Not everyone has these things.	Ba kowa ke da waɗannan abubuwan ba.
They know when they can find us, and where.	Sun san lokacin da za su iya samun mu, da kuma a ina.
It stores food.	Yana ajiye kayan abinci.
It can even go backwards.	Yana iya ma koma baya.
We did the right thing.	Mun yi abin da ya dace.
Why do people come here every year?	Me yasa mutane ke zuwa nan kowace shekara?
One is whether the work is healthy.	Daya shine ko aikin yana da lafiya.
The best thing that ever happened to her was when she ran away.	Mafi kyawun abin da ya taɓa faruwa da shi shine lokacin da ta gudu.
He was very happy to be one.	Yayi matukar farin cikin zama daya.
I finished my homework.	Na gama aikin gida na.
In fact, not on time.	A gaskiya ma, ba a kan lokaci ba.
And this is just a fact.	Kuma wannan gaskiya ce kawai.
They work and they work well.	Suna yin aiki kuma suna aiki da kyau.
It was not so.	Ba haka ta kasance ba.
It doesn’t give him much time.	Ba shi lokaci mai yawa.
Equal to all others.	Daidai da duk sauran.
Not too late or too late.	Ba da wuri ko a makara ba.
I don't want them to get sick.	Ba na son su yi rashin lafiya.
That didn't amount to anything.	Wannan bai kai komai ba.
He brought me.	Ya zo da ni.
I don't have it.	Ba ni da shi.
When you are scared, speak up quickly.	Lokacin da ka ji tsoro, ka yi magana da sauri.
Myself reappeared.	Kaina ya sake bayyana.
You're doing the same thing.	Kuna yin irin abin ɗauka.
It is difficult to make money.	Yana da wuya a sami kuɗi.
He could not agree very well.	Ya kasa yarda sosai.
I will stand in front of him.	Zan tsaya gaba da shi.
You will win, however the game is gone.	Za ku yi nasara, duk da haka wasan ya tafi.
Me too.	Ni kuma.
It doesn't matter.	Bata damu ba.
I'm fine with that.	Ina lafiya da hakan.
Interesting to see something happening here.	Abin sha'awa don ganin wani abu yana faruwa a nan.
We assume that it is outside and without us.	Muna ɗauka cewa akwai a waje kuma ba tare da mu ba.
If the name is not known.	Idan ba a san sunan ba.
Continue reading, my child.	Ci gaba da karatu, yaro na.
They suffered so much.	Sun sha wahala sosai.
We did not know what to do when we arrived.	Ba mu san abin da za mu yi ba lokacin da muka isa wurin.
But this is too much.	Amma wannan ya cika da yawa.
Inside and out, inside and out.	A ciki da waje, ciki da waje.
He kept all the food.	Ya ajiye duk abincin.
He can make coffee himself.	Zai iya yin kofi da kansa.
He told the story.	Ya ba da labarin.
Interesting and useful.	Mai ban sha'awa da amfani.
I'm glad that what happened, happened.	Na yi farin ciki cewa abin da ya faru, ya faru.
It's not interesting.	Ba abin sha'awa bane.
He is coming.	Shi ne mai zuwa.
Nothing for me here.	Babu komai a gare ni a nan.
This is generally true.	Wannan gaskiya ne a gaba ɗaya.
Not really a big deal.	Ba sosai babban aikin girma ba.
I did not grow up that way.	Ban girma haka ba.
They can do whatever they want.	Za su iya yin duk abin da suke so.
He understood this.	Ya fahimci wannan.
They have nothing.	Ba su da komai.
Maybe just both.	Wataƙila duka biyu ne kawai.
I do not want to leave.	Bana son barin.
Well, don't you think?	Da kyau, ba ku tunani?.
They know each other very well.	Sun san juna sosai.
We need everyone to join us.	Muna bukatar kowa ya shiga mu.
It happened twice.	Ya faru sau biyu.
They are more interested in making you money.	Sun fi sha'awar samun ku kuɗi.
You do it every day.	Kuna yin shi kowace rana.
He has no sense of humor.	Ba shi da abin dariya.
I am a fan of it.	Ni ne mai son shi.
They look really good.	Suna kama da gaske.
It works best in cold water.	Ya fi aiki a cikin ruwan sanyi.
We don’t have much to show for it, either.	Ba mu da abubuwa da yawa da za mu nuna a kai, haka ma.
We always forgive each other.	Kullum muna ba juna hakuri.
It was cold, and he was walking fast.	Ya yi sanyi, kuma yana tafiya da sauri.
Off she went.	A kashe ta tafi.
I think we arrived safely.	Ina ganin mun isa lafiya.
After that, no one knew we were here.	Bayan wannan, babu wanda ya san muna nan.
Life is unpredictable.	Rayuwa ba ta da tabbas.
Something bigger and faster than anything he saw that night.	Wani abu mafi girma da sauri fiye da kowane abu da ya gani a wannan dare.
However, it almost never happened.	Duk da haka, kusan bai taba faruwa ba.
But you do not know and you will not do.	Amma ba ku sani ba kuma ba za ku yi ba.
He is a smart, intelligent boy.	Yaro ne mai hankali, mai hankali.
Yaro na.	Yaro na.
She is so beautiful.	Ta yi kyau sosai.
I think so.	Ina tsammanin haka.
This road goes a long way.	Wannan hanya tana tafiya sosai.
They said go there.	Suka ce ku je can.
You see.	Kuna gani.
He had never heard of such a thing.	Bai taba jin irin wannan abu ba.
I spoke to her.	Na yi magana ta.
He said no.	Yace gara a'a.
That is very strange.	Hakan yana da ban mamaki sosai.
No matter what, people are good.	Koma menene, mutane suna da kyau.
There is no way to explain it.	Ba yadda za a yi a bayyana shi.
It was for a few years, and it hasn’t changed.	Ya kasance na ƴan shekaru, kuma bai canza ba.
What to think.	Abin da za a yi tunani.
We cannot live without food.	Ba za mu iya rayuwa ba tare da abinci ba.
But that would be fine.	Amma wannan zai yi kyau.
And she would have liked it.	Kuma da an so ta.
There is truth in that.	Akwai gaskiya a cikin hakan.
Only once, did she not enjoy working.	Sau ɗaya kawai, ba ta jin daɗin aiki.
Nothing new, just a car.	Babu wani sabon abu, kawai mota.
However, she did not appear.	Duk da haka, ba ta bayyana ba.
She will write.	Za ta rubuta.
You are all very tired.	Duk kun gaji sosai.
It requires reflection.	Yana buƙatar tunani.
This will take some time.	Hakan zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
I would like a speeding car.	Ina son mota mai sauri.
Still.	Har yanzu.
He committed suicide after his release.	Ya kashe kansa bayan an sake shi.
This is the most difficult problem.	Wannan ita ce matsala mafi wuya.
He came back empty-handed.	Ya dawo babu komai.
But where do they go when they go?	Amma ina suke zuwa idan sun tafi?
I really like him.	Ina masa gaske.
Something makes you want to learn to play with it.	Wani abu ya sa ka so ka koyi wasa da shi.
But he knew what he was getting into when he signed up.	Amma ya san abin da yake shiga lokacin da ya sa hannu.
The man really is.	Mutumin da gaske yake.
Not how he could.	Ba yadda ya iya.
I am one to say.	Na daya don fada.
We are safe.	Muna lafiya.
You should too.	Ya kamata ku ma.
Apparently even though they are moving fast.	Da alama ko da yake suna tafiya da sauri.
I can make a mistake now.	Zan iya yin kuskure yanzu.
He never told me.	Bai taba gaya mani ba.
I’m not sure what’s preferred.	Ban tabbata abin da aka fi so ba.
I never did.	Ban taba yi ba.
I would even save it if it was a kid.	Zan ma ajiye shi idan yaro ne.
I agree with everything everyone says.	Na yarda da duk abin da kowa ya faɗa.
He made some films himself.	Ya yi dan fim da kansa.
For all of us, this life takes work.	A gare mu duka, rayuwa wannan yana ɗaukar aiki.
It was very cold in our room.	Yayi sanyi sosai a dakin mu.
I am very interested in reading the rest of the article.	Ina matukar sha'awar karanta sauran labarin.
You cannot exceed them.	Ba za ku iya wuce su ba.
He may know himself, but he does not talk about it.	Wataƙila ya san kansa, amma ba ya magana game da shi.
I don't think anyone should.	Ina ganin bai kamata kowa ba.
He has to stop that.	Dole ya tsaya haka.
I hope it helps me.	Ina fata zai taimake ni.
Try them out.	Gwada su.
I lost her.	na bata ta.
Come back, read what they said, add that.	Ka dawo, ka karanta abin da suka ce, ka ƙara cewa.
I even wrote an article about it.	Har na rubuta labarin game da shi.
Everything is fine, really.	Komai yana da kyau, da gaske.
No one has ever feared me in the past.	Ba wanda ya taɓa jin tsoro na a baya.
This is mine.	Wannan nawa ne.
She said that again.	Ta sake cewa.
This is a great achievement.	Wannan abin farin ciki ne da aka yi.
He signed.	Ya sanya hannu.
You never thought of that.	Ba ku yi tunanin wannan ba.
He laughed so hard.	Yayi dariya sosai.
She looked even closer.	Ta kara kyau kusa.
He feels fine here.	Ya ji lafiya a nan.
There are no other people around.	Babu sauran mutane a kusa.
We can do the same here.	Za mu iya yin haka kuma a nan.
You got there.	Kun isa can.
That's enough.	Ya isa haka.
Yet they waited.	Amma duk da haka sun jira.
Those who think the story is false, get up.	Masu tunanin labarin karya ne, ku tashi.
But they did not get it.	Amma ba su samu ba.
This happens to everyone.	Wannan yana faruwa ga kowa da kowa.
Of course there is.	Tabbas akwai.
At your door.	A kofar ku.
They did not tell you that.	Ba su gaya muku haka ba.
She can walk.	Tana iya tafiya.
If he does.	Idan ya yi.
The higher you pay, the more opportunities you have.	Mafi girma da kuke biya, ƙarin damar samun damar ku.
Know you, that you will love him as you love me.	Sanin ku, da za ku so shi kamar yadda kuke so na.
I can try that.	Zan iya gwada hakan.
Absolutely!	Lallai!
It will hit.	Zai buga.
She had to find a place to sleep.	Sai da ta sami wuri ta kwana.
For some people, it is home.	Ga wasu mutane, gida ne.
I do not mind.	Ban damu ba.
We thought about it together.	Mun yi wannan tunanin tare.
Now he is interested.	Yanzu yana sha'awar.
I have never had a house of my own.	Ban taba samun gidan kaina ba.
Right for a while.	Dama na wani lokaci.
And we want that to happen this year.	Kuma muna son abin ya faru a wannan shekara.
He wanted to get home.	Ya so ya isa gida.
She used to do this to him when she wanted something.	Ta kasance tana yi masa haka lokacin da take son wani abu.
Now something new is happening.	Yanzu wani sabon abu yana faruwa.
It needs to grow a little.	Yana bukatar ya girma kadan.
It makes her feel good.	Ya sa ta ji dadi.
I think he didn't care as much as he said he did.	Ina tsammanin bai damu ba kamar yadda ya ce ya yi.
That helped me.	Cewa ya taimake ni.
It was scary.	Ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
This is what you will write or should write if you write.	Wannan shine abin da za ku rubuta ko ya kamata ku rubuta idan kun rubuta.
She said she would not do it.	Ta ce ba za ta yi ba.
I was afraid no one would come.	Na ji tsoro kada wani ya zo.
He was happy at first.	Ya yi farin ciki da farko.
Can you tell me when the last bus left?	Za a iya gaya mani lokacin da bas ɗin ƙarshe ya tashi?
Maybe there is still more.	Wataƙila har yanzu akwai ƙarin.
I did not feel like myself.	Ban ji kamar kaina ba.
John describes himself in surprise.	John ya bayyana kansa da mamaki.
It would be fake.	Zai zama karya ne.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
I left in a hurry.	Na tafi cikin sauri.
We're going to have fun.	Za mu je mu ji daɗi.
The game was very important.	Wasan ya kasance mai matukar bukata.
You are amazing.	Kuna da ban mamaki.
What he did next was amazing.	Abin da ya yi a gaba ya ban mamaki.
Had she not come she would have walked away completely.	Da ba za ta zo ba da ta yi tafiya gaba daya.
Have a nice weekend.	A yi kyakkyawan karshen mako.
It still looks weak.	Har yanzu yana kama da rauni.
I will go to the moon.	Zan tafi wata.
So, that will continue to happen.	Don haka, hakan zai ci gaba da faruwa.
It makes everything even harder.	Yana sa komai ya fi wahala.
You should read them.	Ya kamata ku karanta su.
There is no place for you here, you must know that.	Babu wuri a gare ku a nan, dole ne ku san hakan.
That was three years ago.	Shekaru uku da suka gabata kenan.
Stand	Tsaya
I can't really see the error.	Ba zan iya ganin kuskure da gaske ba.
We accept the truth.	Mu yarda da gaskiya.
They didn’t think about me.	Ba su yi tunani a kaina ba.
This is going to be hot.	Wannan zai zama mai zafi.
I think of you there.	Ina tunanin ku a can.
It was one of the best dinners of the wedding day.	Ya kasance ɗaya daga cikin abubuwan abincin dare mafi kyau na ranar bikin aure.
I recognized him.	Na gane shi.
One let one be.	Daya bari daya zama.
I'm in one right now.	Ina cikin daya a yanzu.
I told her she would lie to me.	Na ce mata za ta yi min karya.
I'm ready	Na shirya
Of course this happens to everyone, but nonetheless.	Tabbas hakan yana faruwa da kowa, amma duk da haka.
She loves this.	Ta son wannan.
Surprisingly.	Abin mamaki.
You are very scared.	Kuna jin tsoro sosai.
Or maybe that’s exactly what he sees.	Ko watakila shi ne ainihin abin da yake gani.
We thought we missed you.	Mun dauka mun rasa ku.
But something seems wrong.	Amma wani abu kamar ba daidai ba.
She was well aware and saw the humor in everything.	Ta yi kyau ta sani kuma ta ga abin ban dariya a cikin komai.
I care about everyone.	Na damu da kowa da kowa.
Just take care of it.	A kula da ita kawai.
We are safe now.	Mun kasance lafiya yanzu.
There are so many things going on with it.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ke faruwa da shi.
I did not know he was there until after the truth.	Ban san yana nan ba sai bayan gaskiya.
Like she knew him from somewhere.	Kamar ta san shi daga wani wuri.
He understands how they work, kind.	Ya fahimci yadda suke aiki, irin.
I hope something changes.	Ina fatan wani abu ya canza.
I have to accept it.	Dole ne in yarda da shi.
I will never be as cold as her.	Ba zan taba zama mai sanyi kamar ta ba.
It's life as usual.	Rayuwa ce kamar kullum.
Nothing interesting.	Babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa.
That person, no matter who he is, can be many people.	Wannan mutumin, ko wanene shi, zai iya zama mutane da dama.
And the child is protected too.	Kuma yaro ya kare ma.
We are happy.	Mun yi farin ciki.
It could be so much better.	Zai iya zama mafi kyau sosai.
Then the first one happened.	Sai na farko ya faru.
Have you ever traveled by train?	Taba tafiya ta jirgin kasa?
Someone answered.	Wani mutum ya amsa.
And that is what happened.	Kuma abin da ya faru ke nan.
He got what people get when they do that.	Ya sami abin da mutane ke samu lokacin da suke yin haka.
He wants us to use them.	Yana son mu yi amfani da su.
You are smart.	Kuna da hankali.
The only problem is, the project takes success.	Matsalar kawai, aikin yana ɗaukar nasara.
He, too, could not just fly.	Shi ma ba zai iya tashi kawai ba.
I have to do this.	Dole ne in yi wannan.
It was a lot but nothing new.	Ya kasance mai yawa amma ba sabon abu ba.
If someone wants to fight, just run.	Idan wani yana son fada, ku gudu kawai.
You can see that.	Kuna iya ganin hakan.
They just.	Suna kawai .
He drank there.	Ya sha zuwa wurin.
Or you will die.	Ko kuma za ku mutu.
I worked a lot.	Na yi aiki da yawa.
It is the opposite.	Ya saba wa .
I didn’t think she was good enough.	Ban yi tunanin ta isa ba.
I hope he never does.	Ina fata ba zai taba yi ba.
But that's the whole story.	Amma shi ke nan duka labarin.
And you use your first name.	Kuma kuna amfani da sunan farko.
I thought of everything.	Na yi tunanin komai.
But she has, and will do tomorrow too.	Amma tana da, kuma za ta yi gobe ma.
I saw it here, here, here.	Na ga shi nan, nan, da nan.
He drank water.	Ya sha ruwa.
They catch you in it.	Suna kama ku a ciki.
She needs to go fast.	Tana bukatar tafiya da sauri.
But not only that.	Amma ba haka kawai ba.
But he heard.	Amma ya ji.
I lived with him for two years.	Na yi shekara biyu ina rayuwa da shi.
He did not see anything.	Ya yi bai ga komai ba.
Tell us your thoughts !.	Faɗa mana tunanin ku!.
I want to finish.	Ina so a gama.
These things can be seen.	Ana iya ganin waɗannan abubuwa.
She will tell you the truth.	Zata gaya maka gaskiya ne.
Just nothing.	Kawai ba komai.
I feel that we often just write to each other.	Ina jin cewa sau da yawa muna rubuta wa juna kawai.
No, it is not.	A'a, ba haka ba ne.
I do not want to talk about this.	Bana son magana akan wannan.
They are not the problem.	Ba su ne matsalar ba.
He came, but slowly, he came and stopped.	Ya zo, amma a hankali, da ya zo ya tsaya.
She is needed.	Ana bukatar ta.
I speak.	Ina magana.
And sometimes he doesn't come back.	Kuma wani lokaci bai dawo ba.
They always laugh.	Kullum sai dariya suke.
It works well.	Yana aiki da kyau.
He is a very nice person inside and out.	Mutum ne mai matukar kyau a ciki da waje.
They should be very nice.	Ya kamata su kasance da kyau sosai.
No one is talking about.	Babu kowa game da.
Actually fight.	A gaskiya fada.
When they pass, we move on.	Idan sun wuce, sai mu ci gaba.
They are very scary.	Suna da ban tsoro sosai.
Otherwise, they are waiting for us.	Ban da haka, suna jiran mu.
And we can work with people.	Kuma za mu iya yin aiki tare da mutane.
I used this method to him.	Na yi amfani da wannan hanyar zuwa gare shi.
Just do whatever you feel you have to do.	Kawai yi duk abin da kuke ji dole ku yi.
He will not answer that.	Ba zai amsa hakan ba.
That may not be the end.	Wannan ba zai iya zama ƙarshe ba.
We need to make sure that this work is successful.	Muna bukatar mu tabbatar da cewa wannan aiki ya yi nasara.
Now we do.	Yanzu muna yi.
I feel some may like it and others do not.	Ina jin wasu na iya son sa wasu kuma ba sa so.
I know you are.	Na san kai ne.
No one died at that time.	Ba wanda ya mutu a lokacin.
He did not feel well.	Bai ji dadi ba.
I think he enjoyed it.	Ina tsammanin ya ji daɗi.
Pay attention to what they have to say.	Kula da abin da za su ce.
It does not matter to them whether they are human or not.	Ba komai a gare shi idan sun kasance mutane ko a'a.
And be honest about how things really work out.	Kuma ku kasance masu gaskiya game da yadda abubuwa ke tafiya da gaske.
We just don’t want them to get out of here.	Ba kawai muna son su fita daga nan ba.
This is where the big fight took place.	A nan ne aka yi babban fada.
Do not enter the room until you have been asked.	Kar ku shiga dakin sai an tambaye ku.
We have no money for two months.	Ba mu da kuɗi wata biyu.
We only need three things to succeed, three things.	Abu uku ne kawai muke bukata don cin nasara, abubuwa uku.
How can we make sure that this does not happen again?	Ta yaya za mu tabbatar da hakan bai sake faruwa ba?
She did not live a happy life.	Ba ta yi rayuwa mai dadi ba.
Like it or not, you are a winner.	So ko a'a, kai mai nasara ne.
He began to run.	Ya fara gudu.
I will never get involved with it.	Ba zan taba shiga kaina da shi ba.
We need to know what is going on there.	Muna bukatar mu san abin da ke faruwa a can.
It looks like a lot.	Yana kama da shi sosai.
I also do not know how to say it.	Ban san kuma yadda zan ce ba.
Saving that's hard.	Ajiye shi ke da wuya.
How much.	Nawa.
The rain is over now.	Ruwan sama ya wuce yanzu.
I too have changed.	Ni ma na canza.
Maybe she didn't like what they were saying.	Wataƙila ba ta ji daɗin abin da suka gaya mata ba.
People talked about it.	Mutane sun yi magana game da shi.
I still feel that way.	Har yanzu ina jin haka.
You will never get it, so don’t worry too much about it.	Ba za ku taɓa samun shi ba, don haka kada ku damu da yawa game da shi.
I use it all the time at the same time.	Ina amfani da shi kowane lokaci a lokaci guda.
Talk to girls after school.	Magana da 'yan mata bayan makaranta.
Do not use it.	Kada ku yi amfani da shi.
This is a surprise to me.	Wannan abin mamaki ne a gare ni.
I wonder how they got the story.	Ina mamakin yadda suka sami labarin.
They kept running.	Suka ci gaba da gudu.
That's why they succeeded.	Shi ya sa suka yi nasara.
I will kill them or they will kill me.	Zan kashe su ko su kashe ni.
Nothing was cut.	Ba a yanke komai ba.
I told them to be sure.	Na ce su tabbata.
I was ready to run.	Na shirya in gudu.
He tried to figure out what to do.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya gano abin da zai yi.
He knows what he is getting.	Ya san abin da yake samu.
That's what we found out.	Haka muka gano.
He is just a human being.	Mutum ne kawai.
The best cold.	A sanyi mafi kyau.
They could not find him.	Sun kasa gano shi.
She needs to touch him, to assure him.	Tana bukatar taba shi, don ta tabbatar masa.
Which is why I think of a missed opportunity.	Abin da ya sa na yi tunanin wata damar da aka rasa.
So he was very active.	Don haka ya kasance mai yawan aiki.
I got that.	Na samu haka.
I shouldn’t have wondered if she could have laughed about me now.	Bai kamata in yi tunanin ko za ta iya yin dariya game da ni yanzu ba.
The second is correct.	Na biyu shine daidai.
The world has returned to the same place as before.	Duniya ta koma wuri guda kamar da.
So, do it next time.	Don haka, yi a lokaci na gaba.
I'm tired, but that's not good.	Na gaji, amma hakan ba shi da kyau.
But probably the second.	Amma tabbas na biyu.
The water was cold and unusually cold.	Ruwan ya yi sanyi da ba a saba gani ba.
She stopped me.	Ta tsaya da ni.
We are very happy.	Muna jin daɗi sosai.
I got, got.	Na samu, samu.
Looking healthy is what happens.	Kallon jin lafiya shine abin da ke faruwa.
And you do.	Kuma kuna yi.
This is a mistake.	Wannan ya zama kuskure.
He could not help it. 	Ya kasa taimaka masa. 
It seems.	Da alama.
So try it out and see what you come up with.	Don haka gwada shi ku ga abin da kuka fito da shi.
You must see this.	Dole ne ku ga wannan.
It seems a little difficult for me.	Ga alama yana ɗan wahala a gare ni.
Of course.	Ya tabbata.
I do not want to go.	Ba na son tafiya.
She can't leave the house.	Ba za ta iya barin gidan ba.
To recommend otherwise fake.	Don ba da shawarar in ba haka ba karya ne.
Say big no call.	Ka ce babban babu kira.
Nothing is right, and nothing is enough.	Babu wani abu da yake daidai, kuma babu abin da ya isa.
Maybe he should go for one.	Wataƙila ya kamata ya je ɗaya.
If you sell now.	Idan ka sayar yanzu.
Nothing has changed before her.	Babu wani abu da ya canza kafin ta.
Now don't worry about me.	Yanzu kada ku damu da ni.
He hopes to travel on another day.	Ya yi tsammanin tafiya a kan wata wata rana.
Every time.	Kowace lokaci.
Then we started.	Daga nan muka fara.
This is where the meeting will take place.	A nan ne za a yi taron.
When he could, he saw again.	Da ya iya, sai ya sake gani.
So it was.	Haka abin ya kasance.
People quit their jobs.	Mutane sun bar aiki.
Life was not easy for us.	Rayuwa ta yi mana wuya sosai.
And the place just feels safe.	Kuma wurin kawai ta ji lafiya.
What happened in the past is the past.	Abin da ya faru a baya shi ne na baya.
And it may not be exactly right here.	Kuma ba zai iya zama daidai sosai a nan ba.
That is the essence of it.	Wannan shine ainihin shi.
There has never been anything like it in the world.	Ba a taɓa samun wani abu mai kama da shi a duniya ba.
You will know better.	Za ku fi sani.
Cut.	A yanke.
Go and have fun.	Ka je ka ji daɗi.
I like the way it was.	Ina son yadda abin ya kasance.
Someone is coming.	Wani yana zuwa.
Boy, did we feel good last night.	Yaro, mun ji dadi a daren jiya.
He did not think they were dead but failed.	Bai yi tsammanin sun mutu ba amma sun kasa.
God is inside and gives us.	Allah yana ciki da kuma ba mu.
Everyone went.	Kowa ya tafi.
They all fail in their quest for happiness.	Duk sun kasa a cikin neman farin ciki.
Even one is right.	Ko daya daidai ne.
She was not known to have been touched because she was asleep.	Da ba a san ana taba ta ba saboda barci take yi.
If money is not a problem,	Idan kudi ba matsala,
There is still a chance for you.	Har yanzu akwai dama a gare ku.
You make sure to eat.	Kai ya tabbatar ya ci abinci.
I know very little.	Na san kadan.
I did not find that to be true.	Ban gano cewa gaskiya ba ne.
I heard she was lying.	Na ji karya take yi.
Focus on the world.	Mai da hankali ga duniya.
He left work early.	Ya bar aiki da wuri.
Others said no.	Wasu kuma suka ce a'a.
Maybe he hates me about it now.	Wataƙila ya ƙi ni game da yanzu.
I may lose my job.	Zan iya rasa aiki na.
Not one and the other.	Ba ɗaya da sauran ba.
You are not happy, you just think you are.	Ba ku da farin ciki, kawai kuna tunanin kuna.
Is there any way to make this a living thing?	Shin akwai wata hanya ta sanya wannan ya zama mai rai.
So she is not coming.	Don haka ba ta zuwa.
Do not try to be something other than yourself.	Kada ka yi ƙoƙarin zama abin da ba kai ba.
Just looking outside.	Kallon waje kawai.
He still has a chance to move on.	Har yanzu yana da damar ci gaba.
You cannot change what happened.	Ba za ku iya canza abin da ya faru ba.
These take time.	Waɗannan suna ɗaukar lokaci.
This is where the game starts.	Wannan shine inda aka fara wasan.
There is no need for this.	Babu bukatar wannan.
We really think so.	Lallai muna tunanin haka.
You are unemployed.	Ba ku da aiki.
Honestly, very fast.	Gaskiya, da sauri sosai.
Of course there is a way.	Tabbas akwai wata hanya.
It looks great, whatever it is, and it travels fast.	Ya yi kama da girma, duk abin da yake, kuma yana tafiya da sauri.
He never thought of that.	Bai taba tunanin wannan ba.
He just has to let everything unfold in time.	Dole ne kawai ya bar komai ya bayyana kansa cikin lokaci.
Then it started.	Daga nan aka fara.
We know nothing bad will come of it.	Mun san babu wani mummunan abu da zai zo daga gare ta.
You have not lost your interest.	Ba ku rasa sha'awar ku ba.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
We have all the comforts at home.	Muna da duk abubuwan jin daɗi a gida.
Anything can wait.	Komai na iya jira.
This is my man.	Wannan mutumin nawa ne.
And he died.	Kuma ya mutu.
Let's see how this came about.	Bari mu ga yadda abin yake.
If a person.	Idan mutum.
It is a world we do not know.	Duniya ce da ba mu sani ba.
And you will be weak.	Kuma za ku yi rauni.
He will accept that.	Zai yarda da hakan.
Let me ask you.	Bari in tambaye ku.
Drinking is the problem.	Shan shi ne matsalar.
Do not disappoint him.	Kar ka bata masa rai.
They are used immediately.	Ana amfani da su nan da nan.
Maybe I missed it.	Wataƙila na rasa shi.
She is tired.	Ta gaji.
I can't seem to get it working right.	Ba zan iya zama kamar ba zan iya samun shi yana aiki daidai ba.
That would be two.	Wannan zai zama biyu.
So we found a place.	Don haka mun sami wuri.
I can fix it.	Zan iya gyara shi.
In the future.	Zuwa gaba.
All on you.	Duk a kan ku.
I did not win that day.	Ban ci nasara ranar ba.
I think he can do it again.	Ina jin zai iya sake.
Life is sometimes hard.	Rayuwa ta kasance wani lokacin wuya haka.
This did not feel like home.	Wannan bai ji kamar gida ba.
And so it is.	Kuma haka abin yake.
He will do it in the future.	Zai yi a nan gaba.
Nothing is shown.	Ba a nuna komai ba.
You help him.	Kuna taimaka masa.
But this is not necessarily a bad thing.	Amma wannan ba lallai ba ne mummunan abu.
I do not need to do anything tonight.	Babu bukatar in yi wani abu a wannan dare.
She was almost three.	Ta kasance kusan uku.
Whatever happens.	Duk abin da ke faruwa.
But it would be nice if she was.	Amma zai yi kyau idan ta kasance.
It really reached him.	Da gaske ya kai gare shi.
I heard her.	Na ji ta.
We have work to do.	Muna da aikin da za mu yi.
No food for two days.	Ba abinci kwana biyu.
But there is one problem.	Amma akwai matsala daya.
You should go.	Ya kamata ku tafi.
I heard her.	Na ji ta.
This train does not have a dining car.	Wannan jirgin kasa ba shi da motar cin abinci.
We spent the night there.	A can muka kwana.
Did the person just call?	Mutumin ya kira kawai?
It's too hot.	Yayi zafi sosai.
She told me something.	Ta gaya min wani abu.
I said he could go.	Na ce zai iya tafiya.
I don't know why but just wanted to try.	Ban san dalilin ba amma kawai so ya gwada.
I got it now.	Na samu yanzu.
He even died.	Har ya mutu.
He had to move there later.	Dole ne ya koma can daga baya.
Why don't we ask for your help?	Me ya sa ba ma neman taimakon ku?
The door is not open.	Kofar gidan bai bude ba.
Let's move on.	Zo mu ci gaba.
You are right.	Kuna da gaskiya.
Sometimes he lost his way.	Wani lokaci ya rasa yadda za a yi.
Never use your real name on anything.	Kada ku taɓa yin amfani da ainihin sunan ku akan komai.
We do not know how to do many more things.	Ba mu san yadda ake yin abubuwa da yawa kuma ba.
As there is nothing interesting about your dress.	Kamar yadda babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa game da rigar ku.
I do not want to record what he said or did.	Ba na so in rubuta abin da ya ce ko ya yi.
Maybe they look like us.	Wataƙila suna kama da mu.
Tell us what you eat.	Faɗa mana abin da kuke ci.
Himself no one.	Kansa babu kowa.
Not since that man was killed.	Ba tun lokacin da aka kashe wannan mutumin ba.
This will be more difficult than she expected.	Wannan zai yi wuya fiye da yadda ta zata.
Not a single thing came out of there.	Ba abu ɗaya da ya fita daga wurin ba.
I never saw this man again.	Ban sake ganin wannan mutumin ba.
You have completely changed.	Kun canza gaba daya.
He loves it.	Yana son shi.
Never drink and drive!	Kada ku taɓa sha kuma ku tuƙi!
No, they did not.	A'a ba su yi ba.
They certainly were.	Lallai sun kasance.
One cannot see the time.	Mutum ba zai iya ganin lokacin ba.
The same thing is happening today.	Haka abin yake faruwa a yau.
I have to learn how to do that.	Dole ne in koyi yadda zan yi hakan.
I heard it myself last night.	Na ji ta da kaina a daren jiya.
No big deal.	Ba a yi babban aiki ba.
But, not really.	Amma, ba da gaske ba.
Iron.	Irin.
I only drink.	Ina shan abin sha ne kawai.
Not sure where to start.	Ban tabbata ta ina zan fara ba.
She is a good dog.	Kare ce mai kyau.
Stop waiting to feel better.	Tsaya jira don jin kyau.
The weekend was amazing.	Karshen mako ya yi ban mamaki.
Let me write this.	Bari in rubuta wannan.
It looks fine.	Ga alama lafiya.
Talk to you slowly.	Yi magana da ku a hankali.
This is a simple task.	Wannan aiki ne mai sauƙi.
Maybe he did well, but he really didn't want to go.	Wataƙila ya yi kyau, amma da gaske bai so ya tafi ba.
However, he did not return.	Duk da haka, bai dawo ba.
If there is heat it must be suffered.	Idan akwai zafi dole ne a sha wahala.
I know what he wants.	Na san abin da yake so.
She wants to talk.	Tana son magana.
Everyone there could not walk.	Da kowa a wurin bai iya tafiya ba.
Only one person is fighting for her.	Mutum daya kadai yake mata fada.
I never wanted to be.	Ban taba son zama ba.
He got water to touch.	Ya sami ruwa ya taba.
Let them mix.	A bar su su sa juna.
We don't fit.	Ba mu dace ba.
She will hate me and later you will see what we do.	Za ta ƙi ni kuma daga baya ku ga abin da muke yi.
But please, please come back tomorrow.	Amma don Allah, don Allah a dawo gobe.
But he did very well.	Amma ya yi kyau sosai.
But with some success.	Amma da ɗan nasara.
I have a lot.	Ina da yawa.
A remarkable development took place.	Wani ci gaba mai ban mamaki ya faru.
These are still good.	Waɗannan duk da haka suna da kyau.
All of these things don't work.	Duk waɗannan abubuwan ba sa aiki.
This is not it.	Wannan ba shi bane.
There it is!	Akwai shi!
It seems to be the right answer.	Da alama amsa ce ta dace.
He began to see the problem.	Ya fara ganin matsalar.
This is a beautiful name that is not uncommon.	Wannan kyakkyawan suna ne da ba a saba gani ba.
Maybe they don't recognize me.	Wataƙila ba su gane ni ba.
Or one day.	Ko kwana daya.
Any time, just this one time.	Kowane lokaci, kawai wannan lokaci daya.
It is the only thing to do with it.	Shi ne kawai abin da za a yi da shi.
We even stayed longer than we paid.	Har ma mun zauna fiye da abin da muka biya.
I don’t want to make it bigger than it is, though.	Ba na so in sa ya fi shi girma, ko da yake.
He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.	Ya kasance a wurin da bai dace ba a lokacin da bai dace ba.
He told me so.	Ya gaya mani haka.
Nothing will ever go smoothly.	Ba abin da zai taɓa tafiya yadda ya kamata.
At school at home learn these three.	A makaranta a gida su koyi waɗannan guda uku.
They will just wait.	Za su yi jira kawai.
I just sat there.	Na dan zauna.
I want more of that.	Ina son ƙarin hakan.
They need the money.	Suna buƙatar kuɗin.
And he could not do what she told him.	Kuma ya kasa yin abin da ta ce masa.
He will recognize it early.	Zai gane shi da wuri.
We should be very careful.	Ya kamata mu kasance muna mai da hankali.
And they do not see.	Kuma ba sa gani.
If it takes a lot of time, make the time appropriate.	Idan yana ɗaukar lokaci mai yawa, sanya lokaci ya dace.
We need your help.	Muna bukatar taimakon ku.
Read it and learn why.	Karanta shi kuma ka koyi dalilin.
And they do it every day.	Kuma suna yin hakan kowace rana.
This is an interesting thing at the moment.	Wannan abu ne mai ban sha'awa a wannan lokacin.
However, he showed them.	Duk da haka, ya nuna su.
Not once did she look where he was.	Ba sau d'aya ta kalli inda yake ba.
He did not know how to bring her back.	Bai san yadda zai dawo da ita ba.
Please don't make me sick.	Don Allah kar in yi rashin lafiya.
When we are all human.	Lokacin mu duka mutane ne.
And we have to keep going.	Kuma dole ne mu ci gaba da tafiya.
I have a job	Ina da aiki
That would be a good development.	Wannan zai zama kyakkyawan ci gaba.
And now he does.	Kuma yanzu ya yi.
Then we got home.	Sai mun isa gida.
It happens rarely.	Yana faruwa da wuya.
Do not return home until it is ready.	Kar ka koma gida sai an shirya.
He remembers the day he left home.	Ya tuna ranar da ya bar gida.
Everyone is waiting.	Kowa yana jira.
I do not understand why.	Ban gane dalilin da ya sa ba.
But then you go.	Amma sai ka tafi.
They don’t know how we do things here.	Ba su san yadda muke yin abubuwa a nan ba.
Above all, of course.	Fiye da komai, tabbas.
But maybe not.	Amma watakila ba.
But there is no time to do that.	Amma babu lokacin yin hakan.
I have to talk to her.	Dole ne in yi magana da ita.
Somehow you got the room.	Ko ta yaya kuka sami dakin.
He has no laugh.	Ba shi da dariya.
He has never been married.	Bai taba yin aure ba.
Not how they work, but how they work.	Ba yadda suke aiki ba, amma yadda ake aiki da su.
The mind looks like that.	Tunanin yana kama da haka.
Immediately responded.	Nan take aka amsa.
Everything will be left behind.	Duk abin da za a bari zai kasance.
But something had to happen.	Amma dole ne wani abu ya faru.
Today was a year ago.	Yau shekara daya da ta wuce.
Sometimes it does, but little.	Wani lokaci yana yi, amma kaɗan.
The past is dead.	Abin da ya gabata ya mutu.
Let's get started.	Mu fara.
He doesn’t like anything and everything in that place.	Ba ya son komai da abubuwan da ke cikin wannan wurin.
Look and see.	Ku duba ku gani.
Not very tasty.	Ba dadi sosai.
I know them.	Na san su.
I am a great tool.	Ni ne babban kayan aiki.
I can't do anything right.	Ba zan iya yin wani abu daidai ba.
I think everyone knows that.	Ina jin kowa ya san haka.
I was so happy I passed it.	Na yi farin ciki sosai na wuce shi.
Why is that?	Me yasa haka haka?
When there is a problem, we will succeed.	Lokacin da akwai matsala, za mu yi nasara.
Good job though.	Kyakkyawan aiki ko da yake.
But this is a good thing.	Amma wannan abu ne mai kyau.
So let’s be.	Don haka bari mu kasance.
But only if you want to.	Amma kawai idan kuna so.
It will always be an effort to keep going.	Zai kasance koyaushe ƙoƙarin ci gaba.
She lost her temper.	Ta bata hakuri.
I think she is happy.	Ina jin tana farin ciki.
It's amazing to feel this delicious.	Yana da ban mamaki jin wannan dadi.
However, it can take a few things.	Duk da haka, ya iya ɗaukar 'yan abubuwa.
It will be close.	Zai kasance kusa.
It would have been more amazing if it had.	Da ya kasance mafi ban mamaki idan yana da.
We will not forget that.	Ba za mu manta da hakan ba.
This is what they do.	Wannan shi ne abin da suke yi.
I do not agree with them.	Ban yarda da su ba.
They will have nothing to return to.	Ba za su sami abin da za su koma ba.
It was a mistake that brought her here.	Kuskure ne ya kawo ta nan.
He does it like a genius.	Yana yin haka kamar mai hankali.
You will be very happy together.	Za ku yi farin ciki sosai tare.
Three children lived in the house.	Yara uku ne suka zauna a gidan.
You never know how things will turn out.	Ba ka taba sanin yadda abubuwa za su kasance ba.
We could not speak.	Mun kasa magana.
She is not where she should be.	Ba ta inda ya kamata ta kasance.
She knew why she didn’t get it.	Ta san dalilin da ya sa ba ta samu ba.
I found myself doing that.	Na sami kaina ina yin haka.
He found a child to talk about.	Ya sami yaro zai yi magana a kai.
He just wants to talk.	Magana kawai yake so.
There’s nothing weird about the game.	Babu wani abu mai ban mamaki game da wasan.
Maybe she's been there so far.	Wataƙila tana can zuwa yanzu.
I didn't want to try.	Ban so in gwada ba.
She always eats.	Kullum tana ci.
Be honest and truthful with them.	Ka kasance mai gaskiya da gaskiya tare da su.
Really sure.	Tabbatar da gaske.
But it came together.	Amma ya zo tare.
It should be written to us.	Ya kamata a rubuta mana.
They should not laugh.	Bai kamata su yi dariya ba.
It was only after a while that he heard them.	Sai bayan wani lokaci bai ji su ba.
I was doing something she had never done before.	Ina yin abin da ba ta taɓa yi ba.
Just go see what he needs.	Kawai je ka ga abin da yake bukata.
He does not usually speak.	Bai saba yin magana ba.
Interesting.	Ban sha'awa.
You start to spend money on women.	Za ka fara kashe mata kudi.
I tried to sit up.	Na yi ƙoƙarin zama.
That makes it safe.	Wannan ya sa lafiya.
Not very good.	Ba kyau sosai.
God does not hate.	Allah ba ya ƙi.
But no, that is not right.	Amma a'a, wannan ba daidai ba ne.
However, now we see how it is.	Duk da haka, yanzu mun ga yadda abin yake.
Or what.	Ko menene.
No one knows what he is doing.	Babu wanda ya san abin da yake yi.
When they released him he was no longer a human being.	Lokacin da suka sake shi yanzu ba mutum ba ne.
We get calls.	Muna samun kira.
However, he realized that something was wrong.	Duk da haka, ya gane cewa wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
The room is not big enough.	Dakin bai kai haka ba.
This did not surprise me, but it did surprise me.	Wannan bai bani mamaki ba, amma ya bani mamaki.
But police work did not pay off.	Amma aikin 'yan sanda bai biya ba.
Let’s move on to the real story.	Bari mu ci gaba zuwa ainihin labarin.
After that everything works fine.	Bayan haka komai yana aiki da kyau.
I can do without it.	Zan iya yi ba tare da hakan ba.
He can walk.	Zai iya tafiya.
They are coming to buy a new home.	Suna zuwa siyan sabon gida.
And they do.	Kuma suna yin su.
They never had a good chance.	Ba su taɓa samun dama mai kyau ba.
Just thinking.	Tunani kawai.
I'm having a good time today.	Na ɗan ji daɗi a yau.
I am looking for something.	Ina neman wani abu.
Not a lot of money, but at the time.	Ba kuɗi da yawa ba ne, amma a lokacin.
Anything because you like them there.	Komai saboda kuna son su a can.
In fact, we really want to write it.	A gaskiya, muna matukar son rubuta shi.
He may not even have one.	Yana iya ma ba shi da ɗaya.
He is such a winner.	Shi ne irin wannan mai nasara.
Do not let it go from you.	Kada ka bari ya tafi daga gare ku.
Surely he is the man at work.	Tabbas shi ne mutumin da ke aikin.
Maybe he is sick.	Wataƙila ba shi da lafiya.
I got a lot more.	Na samu da yawa kuma.
And it is not true at the same time.	Kuma ba gaskiya bane a lokaci guda.
Or you put it.	Ko kuma ka sanya.
It is not an easy task.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
That never happened and it never can.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba kuma ba zai iya ba.
He has been waiting for a long time.	Ya dade yana jira.
I recommend you make the right decision.	Ina ba da shawarar ku yanke shawarar da ta dace.
This is when it is at its best.	Wannan shine lokacin da yake mafi kyawun sa.
There is so much more to do.	Akwai sauran abubuwa da yawa da za a yi.
But now we need a way forward.	Amma a yanzu muna buƙatar hanyar gaba.
That was not easy for her.	Hakan bai mata sauƙi ba.
This did not happen immediately.	Hakan bai faru nan take ba.
I do not even know what it is.	Ban ma san menene hakan ba.
It looked amazing as always.	Ya yi kama da ban mamaki kamar koyaushe.
He did not like it.	Bai son shi.
While	Lokaci
Nothing makes me stop here.	Ba abin da zai sa in tsaya a nan.
However, they ate very little.	Duk da haka, sun ci abinci kaɗan kaɗan.
What the kids are up to today is amazing.	Abin da yara ke ciki a yau yana da ban mamaki.
But only for a while.	Amma kawai na ɗan lokaci.
But we could not find one.	Amma ba mu iya samun daya ba.
They did.	Sun yi.
I finished all the other things.	Na gama da duk sauran abubuwan.
He was a little excited to find out what was going on.	Ya ɗan ji daɗi don gano abin da ke faruwa.
Since then he has seen some benefits.	Tun daga nan ya ga ɗan amfani.
Maybe you should.	Wataƙila ya kamata ku.
She has unrealistic expectations.	Tana da tsammanin da ba na gaskiya ba.
Give them, and we will go immediately.	Ka ba su, kuma mu tafi nan da nan.
It's hard to explain.	Yana da wuya in bayyana.
He did not wait for an answer.	Bai jira amsa ba.
Just not now.	Kawai ba a yanzu ba.
But it will not be yet.	Amma ba zai kasance har yanzu ba.
Maybe she knows.	Watakila ta sani.
Now, he knows.	Yanzu, ya sani.
Happiness is hard.	Farin ciki yana da wuya.
And he heard that.	Kuma ya ji haka.
He came to see us when he decided to film.	Ya zo ya duba mu lokacin da ya yanke shawarar yin fim.
The process is simple.	Hanyar yana da sauƙi.
It did not help.	Bai taimaka ba.
That scared her.	Abin ya ba ta tsoro.
The truth should be so.	Gaskiya yakamata ta kasance haka.
The world has changed.	Duniya ta canza.
And we must succeed.	Kuma dole ne mu yi nasara.
It is not difficult.	Ba shi da wata wahala.
But otherwise, it's fine.	Amma in ba haka ba, yana da kyau.
The events never happened.	Abubuwan da suka faru ba su taɓa faruwa ba.
Be careful with them.	Yi hankali da su.
It's not a good thing.	Ba abu ne mai kyau ba.
And the truth has been proven.	Kuma an tabbatar da gaskiya.
I'm glad you're all right.	Na yi farin ciki kawai kuna lafiya.
After all it is an easy process.	Bayan haka hanya ce mai sauƙi.
That has changed today.	Wannan ya canza a yau.
I want to get out of here.	Ina so in fita daga nan.
With the rest, though.	Tare da sauran, ko da yake.
They keep saying we are there.	Suna ta fada muna can.
Sometimes she gets nothing.	Wani lokacin ba ta samun komai.
Even her.	Ko da ita.
The day was not very pleasant.	Ranar ba ta yi kyau sosai ba.
It's scary.	Tsoro ya kama ni.
No, he had to stop.	A'a, sai da ya tsaya.
Now it's a surprise.	Yanzu abin mamaki ne.
He lied.	Ya yi karya.
There will be no illness.	Ba za a yi rashin lafiya ba.
Second car.	Mota ta biyu.
If there is he uses them.	Idan akwai yana amfani da su.
That's life, you see.	Rayuwa kenan, ka gani.
So do many others.	Haka kuma da yawa wasu.
But come on.	Amma zo.
He knew he could not wait.	Ya san ba zai iya jira ba.
I do not do that.	Ba na yin haka.
Good for home and school.	Mai kyau ga gida da makaranta.
What do you think?	Me kuke tunani?.
Kuna	Kuna
I don't know them very well.	Ban san su sosai ba.
He couldn't do anything to her.	Ya kasa yi mata komai.
They arrive at the bus station.	Suna isa tashar motar.
I will take you to someone who can know the name.	Zan kai ku wurin wanda zai iya sanin sunan.
It may have always been my favorite.	Yana iya zama abin da na fi so koyaushe.
He will later find out everything he needs to know.	Daga baya zai gano duk abin da yake bukata ya sani.
Of course we are.	Tabbas mu ne.
I will ask him.	Zan tambaye shi.
He was right about you.	Ya yi gaskiya game da ku.
I enjoyed them that night.	Na yi farin ciki da su a wannan daren.
Not on that.	Ba akan wannan ba.
And that made him.	Kuma hakan ya sa shi.
She said women would love it.	Ta ce mata za su so shi.
We can, must, and we will do our best.	Za mu iya, dole ne, kuma za mu yi mafi kyau.
This is more than that.	Wannan ya fi haka.
The same is true.	Haka ita ma.
I don’t know exactly what to do with the player right now.	Ban san ainihin abin da zan yi da dan wasan ba a yanzu.
He said you know some were not.	Ya ce ka san wasu ba su kasance ba.
Well, wait.	Da kyau, jira.
If the night is not over yet, wait.	Idan dare bai yi ba tukuna, jira.
But no one could tell me what.	Amma babu wanda ya iya gaya mani menene.
Well she didn’t ask for much.	Da kyau ba ta nemi da yawa ba.
She tells the name of the program.	Ta fada sunan shirin.
However, we will meet next time.	Duk da haka, sai mun hadu a gaba.
I have done it several times.	Na yi shi sau da yawa.
She has nowhere to go.	Ba ta da inda za ta.
But what kind of game.	Amma wane irin wasa ne.
He is always tired.	Kullum ya gaji.
I don't get a job.	Ba na samun wani aiki.
You can try a little more.	Kuna iya ƙoƙarin gwada hakan kaɗan.
Everyone said they had no problem.	Kowa ya ce ba su da matsala.
No two people can agree.	Babu mutane biyu da za su iya yarda.
I don't know how to deal with this.	Ban san yadda za a yi aiki da wannan ba.
You will never have such an opportunity.	Ba za ku taɓa samun wata dama irin wannan ba.
I never see them again, or maybe in a few years.	Ba na sake ganin su, ko watakila a cikin 'yan shekaru.
This happened.	Wannan ya faru.
The car went off the road.	Mota ta fita daga hanya.
It's too fast.	Yayi sauri.
I didn’t get a chance to get anything on it.	Ban sami damar samun komai a kai ba.
They can't keep going.	Ba za su iya ci gaba da tafiya ba.
Some think he was moving too fast.	Wasu suna tunanin ya yi sauri sosai.
So, this is not very useful.	Don haka, wannan ba shi da amfani sosai.
So, you will also start earning money.	Saboda haka, za ku kuma fara samun kuɗi.
To eat is to live.	Don ci shine rayuwa.
Keep telling yourself that.	Ci gaba da gaya wa kanku cewa.
However, I will not give up.	Duk da haka, ba zan daina ba.
It goes up and down.	Yana sama kasa.
How many people can say that?	Mutum nawa ne za su iya cewa?.
She didn't feel anything.	Bata ji komai ba.
I never liked it.	Ban taba son shi ba.
They kill them, but only if they are very sick.	Suna kashe su, amma idan suna da rashin lafiya sosai.
You may have more than one answer.	Kuna iya samun amsa fiye da ɗaya.
I hope not.	Ina fata ba haka ba ne.
It's all good.	Yana da kyau duka.
Of course, we all love it.	Tabbas, duk muna son shi.
I know it will do a great job.	Na san zai yi babban aiki.
We just looked at them.	Kallon su kawai muka yi.
You are getting married.	Kuna shiga cikin aure.
I have it.	Ina da shi.
Suddenly, another car stopped.	Nan da nan sai ga wata mota ta tsaya.
I'm not just back in the game.	Ba kawai na dawo wasa ba.
Everything is for us at the moment.	Komai ne a gare mu a wannan lokacin.
I laughed.	Na yi dariya.
Nothing better happened.	Ba abin da ya fi kyau ya faru.
It happened as usual.	Haka ya faru kamar yadda ya saba.
Maybe they will just keep it.	Wataƙila za su ajiye shi kawai.
This is the way of life.	Wannan ita ce hanyar rayuwa.
He opened himself.	Ya bude da kansa.
No one would agree.	Babu wanda zai yarda da haka.
Give it to him, they take it.	Ka ba shi, suna ɗauka.
I do not live there.	Ba na zaune a can.
This work is done in the rain.	Ana yin wannan aikin a cikin ruwan sama.
It is not good at hand.	Ba shi da kyau a hannu.
Nothing terrible has ever happened to us.	Babu wani abu mai ban tsoro da ya taɓa faruwa da mu.
I think it worked wonders.	Ina tsammanin ya yi aiki mai ban mamaki.
I looked behind the room.	Na kalli bayan dakin.
The first two are small.	Biyu na farko ne kadan.
But they are interesting.	Amma suna da ban sha'awa.
Maybe he knows.	Wataƙila ya sani.
It is not my favorite room.	Ba dakin da ya fi so ba ne.
He is tired.	Ya gaji.
That's right.	Haka ma.
Where we need to go.	Inda muke buƙatar zuwa.
We will see something like this.	Za mu ga wani abu kamar wannan.
Everyone does.	Kowa yayi.
The rest of us will join the next one.	Sauran mu za mu shiga ta gaba.
We want you to understand that.	Muna son ku fahimci hakan.
But if you have any problem, come to me.	Amma idan kuna da matsala, ku zo mini.
It must be thoroughly repaired.	Dole ne a gyara sosai.
It could not be so false.	Ba zai iya zama karya haka ba.
I did not do that.	Ba na yin hakan ba.
Now she looks down.	Yanzu ta kalli kasa.
We want to make sure we get it right.	Muna so mu tabbatar mun samu daidai.
We were quickly told to go.	Da sauri aka ce mu tafi.
He was told it was one.	Sai aka ce masa daya ne.
But, that's what the police are doing.	Amma, abin da 'yan sanda ke yi ke nan.
Do you have a seat yet?	Shin kun sami wurin zama har yanzu?
You can play again.	Kuna iya sake yin wasa.
You never understood.	Ba ka taba gane ba.
I will eat everything.	Zan ci komai.
You know, take care of that.	Ka sani, ku kula da hakan.
I hope he comes home.	Ina fatan ya dawo gida.
We want to make sure.	Muna so mu tabbatar.
The inside is protected.	An kare ciki.
I do not know what to do here.	Ban san abin da za a yi a nan ba.
But she knew everything.	Amma ta san komai.
He did not participate.	Bai shiga ba.
She is still outside.	Har yanzu tana waje.
All by myself.	Duk da kaina.
Not every day will be like that.	Ba kowace rana za ta kasance haka ba.
Could this be ?.	Zai iya zama wannan?.
This is very good.	Wannan yana da kyau sosai.
Otherwise, she would never agree.	In ba haka ba, ba za ta taɓa yarda ba.
She is with them now.	Yanzu ma tana tare da su.
Carry on.	Ci gaba.
Maybe a wishful thinking, but this is your greatest opportunity.	Wataƙila tunanin fata, amma wannan shine babban damar ku.
It makes them sad.	Yana sa su zama bakin ciki.
When she gets up.	Idan ta tashi.
They all ran together.	Duk suka gudu daya.
They got exactly what they expected to get.	Sun sami ainihin abin da suke tsammanin samu.
It should not be.	Bai kamata ya kasance ba.
I really like the way they are.	Ina matukar son yadda suka kasance.
Do not buy.	Kar ku saya.
He’s not really the best players.	Ba shi ne ainihin mafi kyawun 'yan wasa ba.
Still not involved.	Duk da haka ba hannu.
Get caught inside.	A kama a ciki.
I will never accept it, we are there tonight.	Ba zan taba yarda da shi ba, muna can a wannan daren.
He made a mistake.	Ya yi kuskure.
There is so much more to do.	Akwai sauran abubuwa da yawa a yi.
.	.
It is difficult, but you will succeed.	Yana da wahala, amma za ku yi nasara.
I can say it happened, get that money.	Zan iya cewa ya faru, sami wannan kuɗin.
It will be the same today.	Haka za a yi haka a yau.
We drink a lot of water	Muna shan ruwa da yawa
But you will be fine.	Amma za ku kasance lafiya.
They are still indoors, though.	Har yanzu suna cikin gida, ko da yake.
What can one say.	Me mutum zai iya cewa.
This is not difficult.	Wannan ba shi da wahala.
They are unpleasant and unhealthy.	Ba su da daɗi kuma ba su da kyau.
Bring him here, as they speak.	Ku kawo shi nan, kamar yadda suke magana.
You do it every day, and everything, the best.	Kuna yin kowace rana, kuma komai, mafi kyau.
She wondered if they were making progress.	Ta yi tunanin ko suna samun ci gaba.
The water is very cold.	Ruwan ya ɗan yi sanyi sosai.
Maybe she made a mistake.	Wataƙila ta yi kuskure.
The immediate location is nice.	Wurin nan da nan yana da kyau.
If you are or have ever been married.	Idan kun kasance ko kun taɓa yin aure.
I tried to think about it.	Na yi ƙoƙari na yi tunani a kai.
Everyone knows it.	Kowa ya san shi.
How can that be?	Ta yaya hakan zai kasance?
The night has come.	Dare ya zo.
You have time.	Kuna da lokaci.
You need help.	Kuna buƙatar taimako.
You have everything to lose.	Kuna da komai don rasa.
It was the coldest night of the winter.	Shi ne dare mafi sanyi na lokacin sanyi.
I thought a lot.	Na yi tunani sosai.
They are not the problem.	Ba su ne matsalar ba.
Here are some more than others.	Ga wasu fiye da wasu.
I care.	Ina kula.
He heard something outside.	Ya ji wani abu a waje.
Store until cool.	Ajiye har sai yayi sanyi.
If not, you will not.	Idan ba haka ba, ba za ku yi ba.
He is patient.	Shi ne mai hakuri.
Everyone is human to human.	Duk mutum ne zuwa mutum.
I need to hear it.	Ina bukata in ji shi.
Without water, there would be no life.	Idan babu ruwa, da babu rayuwa.
Time has not stopped.	Lokaci bai tsaya ba.
I feel good, but he doesn't know me.	Ina jin dadi, amma bai san ni ba.
We'll make it look like you didn't go.	Za mu sanya shi kamar ba ku tafi ba.
But he was not.	Amma bai kasance ba.
In a way it is good.	A hanyar yana da kyau.
And that's fine.	Kuma hakan yayi kyau.
He does not touch me much.	Ba ya yawan taba ni.
Change your mind.	Canza tunanin ku.
I have no money.	Ba ni da kudi.
This is an interesting person.	Wannan mutum ne mai sha'awa.
What do you do or plan to do?	Abin da kuke yi ko shirin yi shi ne ?
As such.	Kamar haka.
He would not be happy if he found out.	Ba zai ji daɗi ba idan ya gano.
Think about this carefully.	Yi tunani game da wannan a hankali.
She began to fail.	Ta fara kasa.
Water, in the room.	Ruwan ruwa, a cikin dakin.
It can be great.	Zai iya zama mai girma.
To catch him.	Don kama shi.
You see don't forget them.	Ka ga kar ka manta su.
Maybe it didn’t change anything for him.	Wataƙila ba ta canza masa komai ba.
Please do it for him.	Don Allah a yi masa haka.
Let's hope the sun stays on for a while.	Bari mu yi fatan rana ta tsaya na ɗan lokaci.
I can not tell you anything.	Ba zan iya gaya muku wani abu ba.
For a while, things were fine.	Na ɗan lokaci, abubuwa suna da kyau.
Children need to be careful.	Yara suna buƙatar yin hankali.
But there is nothing you can not give less money to yourself.	Amma babu abin da ba za ku iya ba da kuɗi kaɗan ga kanku ba.
He is a great man.	Babban mutum ne.
But it always gets louder and louder.	Amma ko da yaushe yana ƙara ƙara.
I am not married yet.	Ban yi aure ba tukuna.
We want to hear from you !.	Muna son ji daga gare ku!.
I felt like.	Na ji kamar.
We can't do that yet.	Ba za mu iya yin hakan ba tukuna.
You are feeling better for a week.	Kuna jin daɗi har tsawon mako guda.
The problem is, no one really knows what he wants.	Matsalar ita ce, babu wanda ya san ainihin abin da yake so.
She replied that she had never.	Ta amsa da cewa bata taba.
But there is one thing you do not need to ask me.	Amma akwai abu daya da ba ka bukatar ka tambaye ni.
Get down on your knees.	Ku yi kasa a gwiwa.
I look forward to this day.	Ina fatan wannan ranar.
But they do not know what to do.	Amma ba su san abin da za su yi ba.
It started really well.	Ya fara da kyau sosai.
It may even be you.	Yana iya ma zama ku.
We take care of anyone who asks for help.	Muna kula da kowane mutumin da ya nemi taimako.
Needless to say, she went at the same time.	Ba dole a ce ba, ta tafi lokaci guda.
The book is over.	Littafin ya kare.
I know they do.	Na san suna yi.
You can do anything and she does it great.	Kuna iya yin komai kuma tana yin hakan mai girma.
Although, at first they refused to accept it.	Ko da yake, da farko sun ƙi yarda da su.
I’ve never wanted a dog so much, feeling life is so hard.	Ban taɓa son kare da yawa ba, jin rayuwa tana da wahala sosai.
And I did.	Kuma na yi.
I knew they would run away.	Na san za su gudu.
But that's how you fix it.	Amma haka za ku gyara.
Leave me alone.	Ka bar min haka.
They still do not know.	Har yanzu ba su sani ba.
Every path has its problems.	Kowace hanya tana da matsala.
I'm really coming.	Ina zuwa da gaske.
I have it almost a year now.	Ina da shi kusan shekara guda yanzu.
You are a local person.	Kai mutumin gida ne.
But it is.	Amma haka abin yake.
It would be nice to help someone.	Zai zama abin daɗi don taimaka wa wani.
But it still happened.	Amma duk da haka ya faru.
Homework is not necessary.	Aikin gida bai zama dole ba.
Equipment in the workplace.	Kayan aiki a wurin aiki.
This place was amazing.	Wannan wurin ya kasance abin ban mamaki.
One knows the reason, of course.	Daya ya san dalilin, ba shakka.
Despite.	Shi ne.
So it was.	Haka abin ya kasance.
He was honest and nice.	Ya kasance mai gaskiya da kyau.
This food is not very useful.	Wannan abincin ba shi da amfani sosai.
I can't take it now.	Ba zan iya ɗauka ba yanzu.
It lasted for thirty years.	Ya kasance har tsawon shekaru talatin.
It takes a little effort.	Yana ɗaukar ɗan ƙoƙari.
She really knows me.	Ta san ni da gaske.
In fact, they are very tasty.	A gaskiya, suna da daɗi sosai.
The need is real.	Bukatar gaskiya ce.
It will do us all good.	Zai yi mana kyau duka.
So we need to be very careful.	Don haka muna bukatar mu mai da hankali sosai.
We agree with that.	Mun yarda da haka.
He wouldn't want me to call him.	Ba zai so in kira shi ba.
You can use it to watch you.	Kuna iya amfani da shi don kallon ku.
Right from the start.	Dama tun da wuri.
There are only.	Akwai kawai.
He will be back.	Zai dawo.
We don't know how it will turn out, yet.	Ba mu san yadda zai kasance ba, tukuna.
However, there are some disadvantages.	Duk da haka, akwai wasu rashin jin daɗi.
He doesn't like me.	Ba ya so na.
I don't have to bring it here.	Bai kamata in kawo shi nan ba.
It's just fun to play together.	Abin farin ciki ne kawai a yi wasa tare.
I don't remember eating anything.	Ban tuna cin komai ba.
I do not want to go to this game.	Ba na son zuwa wannan wasan.
People were happy, happy.	Mutane sun yi farin ciki, farin ciki.
Still, you are here now.	Har yanzu, kuna nan yanzu.
Think about whether you agree with him.	Yi tunani ko kun yarda da shi.
Today is the day we grew up!	Yau ce ranar da muka girma!
First there is the large seating area, the dining area.	Da farko akwai babban wurin zama, wurin cin abinci.
I never got one.	Ban taba samun daya ba.
If it does, you have nothing to worry about.	Idan ya yi, babu abin da za ku damu.
It is not true.	Ba gaskiya ba ne.
I know they won't.	Na san ba za su yi ba.
A lot of time has passed.	Lokaci da yawa ya wuce.
Of course I will do it again.	Tabbas zan sake yin ta.
I am trying to finish this book.	Ina ƙoƙarin gama wannan littafin.
We got you covered.	Mun samu ku a rufe.
Take care.	Ku kula.
I don’t know how fast this car will go.	Ban san yadda wannan motar za ta yi sauri ba.
This is amazing.	Wannan ya zama abin ban mamaki.
I'm sure you enjoyed hearing this.	Na tabbata kun ji daɗin jin wannan.
I felt uncomfortable with them.	Na ji ba dadi a gare su.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
At the right time.	A lokacin da ya dace.
There is nothing interesting here, he said.	Babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa a nan, in ji shi.
They took nothing.	Ba su ɗauki komai ba.
I really enjoyed it.	Na ji daɗi sosai.
Maybe not time or place.	Wataƙila ba lokaci ko wurin ba.
So, it is still not so.	Don haka, har yanzu ba haka ba ne.
You have a job and you plan ahead.	Kuna da aiki kuma kuna shirin gaba.
They ran three to do.	Sun yi gudu uku don yin.
That should be done.	Haka ya kamata a yi.
It wasn't until they sold me.	Sai da suka sayar da ni.
Ask anyone you know.	Tambayi duk wanda ka sani.
Things are not as they are.	Abubuwa ba kamar yadda suke ba.
I know you have.	Na san kuna da.
We will call it until we learn it well.	Za mu kira shi har sai mun koyi da kyau.
I will not spend the night here.	Ba zan kwana a nan ba.
We will take the bus to the station.	Za mu ɗauki bas zuwa tashar.
Maybe he saw it, maybe he didn’t.	Wataƙila ya gani, watakila bai yi ba.
Uncertain, it's huge.	Ba shi da tabbas, yana da girma.
There is no way.	Babu wata hanya.
He will check.	Zai duba.
You have to trust me.	Dole ne ku yarda da ni.
Some from eating, some from eating.	Wasu daga ci, wasu daga ci.
But if you do not know you are doing it right.	Amma idan ba ku san kuna yin daidai ba.
The water came out.	Ruwan ruwa ya fita.
You see how they were when they were together.	Kun ga yadda suke a lokacin da suke tare.
You must read this book.	Dole ne ku karanta wannan littafin.
Just let it play.	Kawai bari yayi wasa.
We walk after dinner.	Muna tafiya bayan cin abincin dare.
I don't want to be here.	Ba na son zama a nan.
And we are waiting.	Kuma muna jira.
We feel good.	Mun ji dadi.
This is not a place for women and children.	Wannan ba wurin mata da yara ba ne.
You will be happy.	Za ku ji daɗi.
They stay cool.	Sun tsaya sanyi.
I have to leave something out.	Dole na bar wani abu.
And we really enjoyed it.	Kuma mun ji daɗi sosai.
I have little use here.	Ba ni da amfani kaɗan a nan.
I have to be careful too.	Dole ne in yi hankali kuma.
Suddenly I saw why you were so big.	Nan da nan na ga dalilin da ya sa kuka kasance babban abu.
I fixed it.	Na gyara shi.
You could get hurt or even kill yourself.	Kuna iya samun rauni ko ma kashe kanku.
At the door he stopped.	A bakin kofar ya tsaya.
Just go.	Ku tafi kawai.
But he did not listen.	Amma bai ji ba.
You can do this yourself if you know how.	Kuna iya yin wannan da kanku idan kun san yadda.
But the sun didn't matter to him.	Amma rana ba komai a gare shi.
Lots of it.	Da yawa daga ciki.
We expected someone to come to us.	Mun yi tsammanin wani zai zo mana.
I would love to think about it.	Zan yi sha'awar yin tunani game da shi.
Visual.	Na gani.
That was clear early on.	Hakan ya bayyana da wuri.
This is an exciting time.	Wannan wani lokaci ne mai ban sha'awa.
I started with most of this.	Na fara da mafi yawan wannan.
That should be sufficient enough.	Wannan ya isa haka.
To really work.	Don yin aiki na gaske.
Maybe that's not good for him.	Watakila hakan bai masa kyau ba.
I'm still waiting to see.	Har yanzu ina jira in gani.
I tell other people.	Ina gaya wa sauran mutane.
With that kind of thinking, you can't see the truth.	Da irin wannan tunanin, ba za ku iya ganin gaskiya ba.
There is no certainty in the future.	Babu tabbas a nan gaba.
They found a way.	Sun sami hanya.
They will all find many things known in the world today.	Duk za su sami abubuwa da yawa da aka sani a duniya a yau.
I will not lie.	Ba zan yi karya ba.
There is no greater world.	Babu duniya mafi girma.
She is coming to him again.	Tana zuwa masa kuma.
It's hard to see much outside.	Yana da wuya a ga yawa a waje.
I looked at myself.	Na duba da kaina.
He loves them.	Yana son su.
He said it would take a long time.	Yace zai dauki lokaci mai yawa.
She went to a restaurant.	Ta tafi wani gidan abinci.
We got out of there quickly.	Mun fita daga wurin da sauri.
Why he did it, no one now knows.	Abin da ya sa ya yi haka, babu wanda ya sani yanzu.
He must have a livelihood.	Dole ne ya sami abin rayuwa.
There is a lot of work to be done.	Akwai babban aiki da ya kamata a yi.
I want to do the right thing.	Ina so in yi abin da ke daidai.
That does not work.	Hakan baya aiki.
This time it was funny.	Wannan lokacin abin ban dariya ne.
But here, there is something.	Amma a nan, akwai wani abu.
That did not help.	Hakan bai taimaka ba.
Or what.	Ko menene.
Maybe I will put in some work to fix that.	Wataƙila zan sanya wani aiki don gyara hakan.
And one day, she did.	Kuma wata rana, ta yi.
Then another boy.	Sai kuma wani yaro.
Do everything right.	Yi komai daidai.
When did you like this?	Yaushe kuke son wannan?
We cried and laughed.	Muka yi kuka da dariya.
This is a great statement.	Wannan babban magana ce.
He had to fall behind the plane.	Dole ne ya fada bayan jirgin.
Not just walking.	Ba tafiya kawai ba.
I don’t cry or anything.	Ba na kuka ko wani abu.
No one wants to miss what will happen next.	Babu wanda ya so ya rasa abin da zai faru a gaba.
They like it.	Sun so shi.
The rest will come in time.	Sauran za su zo a cikin lokaci.
It should not be played like that.	Bai kamata a yi wasa kamar haka ba.
You probably know that.	Wataƙila kun san hakan.
Let me meet you somewhere.	Bari in hadu da ku a wani wuri.
But so man.	Amma haka mutum.
Why not do it.	Me ya sa ba za ku yi ba.
Hope you like it !!!!.	Da fatan za ku so shi!!!!.
Have a life.	Samun rayuwa.
He appears to be unwell.	Ya bayyana cewa bata da lafiya.
Gradually they closed.	A hankali suka rufe.
They can get help.	Za su iya samun taimako.
Life is hard.	Rayuwa tana da wahala.
To continue.	Don ci gaba.
Not eleven.	Ba a sha ɗaya ba.
The fear is overwhelming.	Tsoro yana da yawa.
We met last night in this room.	Mun hadu a daren jiya a nan dakin.
It feels uncomfortable	Yana jin babu dadi
You can decide for yourself.	Kuna iya yanke shawarar kanku.
Of course not.	Ko shakka babu.
If they win, they need to prepare for next week's game.	Idan sun yi nasara, suna bukatar su shirya don wasan mako mai zuwa.
I still don’t agree with that.	Har yanzu ba zan yarda da wannan ba.
There is no such thing.	Babu wani abu kamar haka.
So he asked for help.	Shi ya sa ya nemi taimako.
Why bother?	Me yasa damu?
It's his job.	Aikin sa ya yi.
They may take some advantage of them.	Suna iya ɗaukar wasu yin amfani da su.
It wouldn’t surprise me.	Ba zai ba ni mamaki ba.
And kids need more of it.	Kuma yara suna buƙatar ƙarin shi.
You will see.	Za ku gani.
I think that's where it came from.	Ina tsammanin daga nan ne ya fito.
I have told you this before.	Na gaya muku haka a gaba.
What does he want her to wonder.	Me yake so ta yi mamaki.
Can we drive?	Za mu iya yin tuƙi?
She waited for him to arrive.	Sai da ta jira shi ya isa wurin.
They both raised their hands.	Su biyu suka daga hannu.
But there is more to that than that.	Amma akwai ƙarin inda hakan ya fito.
I was a child at the time.	Ni a lokacin ina yaro.
I hope it does not fit into that.	Ina fatan bai yi daidai da hakan ba.
Another man was killed.	An kashe wani mutum.
I will recommend it in the future.	Zan ba shi shawarar nan gaba.
It is good to love one another.	Yana da kyau a so juna.
She cried and cried.	Kuka take ta ajiye.
We thought we were safe.	Mun yi tunanin lafiya.
Time on time on time on time.	Lokaci akan lokaci akan lokaci akan lokaci.
When something works, well, that's it.	Lokacin da wani abu ke aiki, da kyau, shi ke nan.
Ita ko.	Ita ko.
At this time however.	A wannan lokacin amma.
He is saying something.	Yana cewa wani abu.
The room is too hot.	Dakin yayi zafi sosai.
But that is not going to happen.	Amma hakan ba zai faru ba.
I was close to the goods.	Na yi kusa da kayan.
I got injured	Na samu rauni
It seems like more information is needed.	Ya zama kamar dole ne a sami ƙarin labarin.
I looked at them.	Na duba su.
Are there any?	Shin akwai waɗannan?.
Sky.	Sama.
Do not say die.	Kada a ce mutu.
Do not let her know these things.	Kada ku bari ta san waɗannan abubuwa.
And that is true today.	Kuma hakan ya kasance gaskiya a yau.
He entered the room and looked around.	Dakin ya shiga ya duba.
Our teacher is very much needed.	Malamin mu yana da matukar bukata.
Please finish this, tonight.	Da fatan gama wannan, yau da dare.
I can’t think of any hard work.	Ba zan iya tunanin wani aiki mai wahala ba.
No one thought.	Ba wanda ya yi tunani.
I have already explained this to you.	Na riga na bayyana muku wannan.
She never told me about it.	Ba ta taba bani labarin hakan ba.
Make people believe you.	Ka sa mutane su yarda da kai.
I spoke well of him.	Na yi magana mai kyau da shi.
There are people in the house.	Akwai mutane a gidan.
The two do not match.	Biyu ba su dace ba.
And this is a great thing.	Kuma wannan abu ne mai girma.
He must feel real.	Dole ne ya ji gaske.
You are sure.	Kun tabbatar.
However, it is still in use today.	Duk da haka, har yanzu ana amfani da shi a yau.
I would be happy to work with you on this.	Zan yi farin cikin yi muku aiki akan wannan.
This will be where we meet the oil.	Wannan zai kasance inda za mu hadu da mai.
I forgot exactly how it was, but no one was hurt.	Na manta daidai yadda abin ya kasance, amma babu wanda ya ji rauni.
He did not get it.	Bai samu ba.
I love me now	Ina son ni yanzu
You have to speak when you are being spoken to.	Dole ne ku yi magana idan ana magana da ku.
Only the second son.	Dan na biyu ne kawai.
That fascinated me.	Hakan ya bani sha'awa.
You can not imagine.	Ba za ku iya tunanin.
I am very happy that now, we are.	Na yi matukar farin cikin cewa yanzu, muna.
I don't drink much.	Ba na yawan sha.
Both, all mine.	Duka, duk nawa.
This, however, is a mistake.	Wannan, duk da haka, kuskure ne.
It gets a little easier.	Yana samun sauƙi kaɗan kaɗan.
After that, bring your hand back.	Bayan haka, kawo hannu zuwa baya.
One knows she knows.	Mutum ya san ta sani.
It was only done for a month.	An yi shi kawai tsawon wata guda.
So it was.	Haka abin ya kasance.
He was afraid of me.	Yana jin tsoro na.
I really do have it now.	Ina da gaske a yanzu.
You are not like the others.	Ba ka zama kamar sauran ba.
Who knows, she probably did.	Wa ya sani, tabbas ta yi.
She said this could not be true.	Ta ce wannan ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
Nothing to return to.	Babu abin da za a koma.
I still haven't gone out.	Har yanzu ban fita ba.
So, we.	Saboda haka, mu.
It's home.	Gida ne.
I have to remember.	Dole ne in tuna.
But he could not afford such an opportunity.	Amma bai iya ba da dama irin wannan ba.
Absolutely.	Babu shakka.
I can not say for sure whether it really is his own.	Ba zan iya cewa da gaske ba ko da gaske yana da kansa.
He did not answer.	Bai amsa ba.
Or maybe you are.	Ko watakila kai ne.
Suppose they are sick on board.	Ko a ce suna da rashin lafiya a cikin jirgin.
Just imagine what you are doing.	Kawai yi tunanin abin da kuke yi.
Sorry to keep waiting.	Yi hakuri don ci gaba da jira.
I do not want to stay in the house.	Ba na son zama a gidan.
You know, these are real women.	Ka sani, waɗannan mata ne na gaske.
I laughed.	Na bani dariya.
I love everyone.	Ina son kowa.
The man thought.	Mutumin yayi tunani.
No sorry, nothing.	Babu hakuri, babu komai.
Maybe she thought so.	Wataƙila ta yi tunanin haka.
Do everything right.	Yi komai daidai.
But do not worry.	Amma kada ka damu.
No one cares about you, except you.	Babu wanda ke kula da ku, sai ku.
We do not know yet.	Ba mu san komai ba tukuna.
We have no idea.	Ba mu da wani tunani.
I love the man.	Ina son mutumin.
I tried to speak slowly.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin magana hankali.
It would have been better if he had been left alone.	Da ma a bar shi shi kadai zai yi hankali.
No no no.	A a'a ba a'a ba.
It feels like.	Yana jin kamar.
As you can imagine.	Kamar yadda kuke tunani.
I feel very touched.	Ina jin an taɓa ni sosai.
We must act honestly.	Ya kamata mu yi aiki da gaskiya.
I was badly injured.	Na yi mummunan rauni.
He wanted to be with her tonight.	Ya so ya kasance da ita a daren nan.
Our project plan is as follows.	Shirin aikin mu shine kamar haka.
This is a great thing.	Wannan babban abu ne.
What is in it, and how do we know?	Menene a ciki, kuma ta yaya muka sani?.
the cold did not bother him.	sanyi bai damu ba.
There was no way she could.	Babu yadda ta iya.
She just did.	Kawai ta yi.
They have been trying to do this for two or three years.	Sun kasance suna ƙoƙarin yin hakan tsawon shekaru biyu ko uku.
In fact, it is not even close.	A gaskiya, ba ma kusa ba.
It is nothing new.	Ba sabon abu ba ne.
I can say that he began to trust me.	Zan iya cewa ya fara yarda da ni.
I did and it worked.	Na yi kuma ya yi aiki.
Sleep well!	Barci sosai!
But that was it.	Amma hakan ya kasance .
There is no decision to make.	A nan babu wani shawarar da za a yanke.
One has to do it.	Dole ne mutum ya yi.
Add three more.	Ka kara masa uku.
You do not have to travel.	Ba sai ka yi tafiya ba.
Something has to be done.	Dole ne a yi wani abu.
And let's go right away.	Kuma mu tafi nan da nan.
We got our car.	Mun sami motar mu.
The mind would never think so.	Hankali ba zai taba tunanin haka ba.
You can not change the past.	Ba za ku iya canza abin da ya gabata ba.
They will do so, he knows.	Za su yi haka, ya sani.
At first you do not even know what happened.	Da farko baka ma san me ya faru ba.
If they are still there, drive again.	Idan har yanzu suna nan, sake yin tuƙi.
It will definitely reach her tonight.	Tabbas zai kai ta daren yau.
I have no money.	Ba ni da kuɗi.
I'll just think about it.	Zan kawai yi tunani game da shi.
You can read about it here, here, soon.	Kuna iya karanta game da shi nan, nan, nan da nan.
I know she is not.	Na san ba ita ba ce.
So they went their way.	Don haka suka tafi komai.
Don’t fall for that.	Kada ku fada don wannan.
He never did anything, wherever he looked.	Bai taba yin komai ba, duk inda ya duba.
He was weak.	Ya kasance mai rauni.
I think a lot of people are doing the same thing.	Ina tsammanin mutane da yawa suna yin irin wannan abu.
But if they do, it will be better for them.	Amma idan sun yi hakan zai yi kyau.
It was the sweetest thing.	Shi ne abu mafi dadi.
He is walking.	Yana tafiya.
It's my turn.	Lokacin nawa ne.
He fell forward.	Ya fad'a gaba.
The same thing can happen.	Haka zai iya faruwa.
I did not know you could do that.	Ban san za ku iya yin wannan ba.
But you were wrong.	Amma kun yi kuskure.
I am alone here.	Ni kadai a nan.
I do not believe he can.	Ban yarda zai iya ba.
But at the moment, this is not good.	Amma a wannan lokacin, wannan ba shi da kyau.
Do you think we should go? 	Kuna tsammanin za mu yi tafiya?
saying.	yana cewa.
They know the work he does.	Sun san aikin da ya yi.
And that can be painful.	Kuma wannan na iya zama mai zafi.
We have now confirmed this statement.	Yanzu mun tabbatar da wannan magana.
I think it helped a lot.	Ina tsammanin ya taimaka sosai.
She is married now.	Ta yi aure yanzu.
I do not like them.	Ba na son su.
Do it as well as you can.	Yi shi da kyau kamar yadda za ku iya.
Not a difficult thing.	Ba abu mai wahala ba.
Like, you always have.	Kamar, kun kasance koyaushe.
You appear to go.	Kun bayyana don tafiya.
I can really.	Zan iya gaske.
There was a man on the ground.	Akwai wani mutum a kasa.
This stuff will kill you.	Wannan kayan zai kashe ku.
No more work.	Ba a sake yin aiki ba.
He could not stop killing them.	Ba zai iya daina kashe su ba.
Go to work.	Je zuwa aiki.
He suffered head injuries.	Ya samu rauni a kai.
None of the latter.	Babu ko ɗaya a cikin na ƙarshe.
It is not an easy task.	Ba abu mai sauƙi ba ne.
Yet there is a truth there.	Duk da haka akwai wata gaskiya a can.
It hurts in the knee.	Yana da zafi a gwiwa.
Not real success, but not exactly success.	Ba ainihin nasara ba, amma ba daidai ba da nasara.
It must be new.	Dole ne ya zama sabon.
I want to remove it a little bit.	Ina so in cire shi kadan kadan.
So there can be a way to do that.	Don haka ana iya samun hanyar yin hakan.
I can’t imagine what others think of me.	Ba zan iya tunanin abin da wasu suke tunani game da ni ba.
It takes a lot of work to get everything done, too.	Aiki ne mai yawa don samun komai, kuma.
I don’t care about the project.	Ban damu da aikin ba.
So you can use that.	Don haka kuna iya amfani da hakan.
He went one way or another.	Ya tafi ta wata hanya.
It rained a little.	An yi ruwan sama kadan.
And she ate.	Kuma ta ci.
She did not respond immediately.	Bata amsa ba nan take.
I went out for a swim, alone.	Na fita don yin iyo bayan, ni kadai.
That happened again.	Hakan ya sake faruwa.
This may not be correct.	Wannan ba zai iya zama daidai ba.
Food does not work.	Abinci baya aiki.
But you did not really say you would come today.	Amma da gaske ba ka ce yau za ka zo ba.
Die with her.	Mutu da ita.
But now, no.	Amma yanzu, a'a.
I know it should.	Na san ya kamata.
Yet life goes on.	Duk da haka rayuwa ta ci gaba.
They’re good about things like that.	Sun yi kyau game da abubuwa kamar haka.
Ask him out well if he is no longer absorbed in the connection.	Ka tambaye shi me zai yi.
I would recommend it to anyone.	Zan ba shi shawarar ga kowa.
If he had not, he would have already died.	Idan kuma bai kasance ba, tabbas ya riga ya mutu.
A lot of work needs to be done here.	Ana buƙatar yin aiki da yawa a nan.
Please be very careful.	Don Allah a kula sosai.
Take that.	Take haka.
And he gets there quickly.	Kuma yana isa wurin da sauri.
That there are opportunities.	Wannan akwai dama.
Surprisingly, he was there twice.	Abin mamaki, yana nan sau biyu.
Just making money.	Kamar samun kudi.
She wanted to go in, not go ahead.	Ta so ta shiga, ba ta yi gaba ba.
But the world went into it.	Amma duniya ta shiga ciki.
In fact, you are safe.	A gaskiya, kuna lafiya.
Yet she had to get involved.	Amma duk da haka dole ta shiga.
I went in and was arrested.	Na shiga aka kama ni.
But it is amazing.	Amma abin mamaki ne.
That did not happen.	Hakan bai faru ba.
Where she was.	Inda ta kasance.
But we really don't have time to look at it.	Amma da gaske ba mu da lokacin da za mu duba shi.
She didn't think of anything.	Bata yi tunanin komai ba.
He never told us this!	Bai taba gaya mana wannan ba!
They didn’t pay me to get it.	Ba su biya ni in samu.
In fact he did.	A gaskiya ya yi.
I did not lie.	Ban yi karya ba.
The children are tired.	Yara sun gaji.
There is a reason for this.	Akwai dalilin hakan.
I would have thought so.	Da na yi tsammanin haka.
I talked to him a lot.	Na yi magana da shi sosai.
I have access to it.	Ina da dama gare shi.
It's good for us.	Yana da kyau a gare mu.
I went to the wedding.	Na je bikin aure.
Sure she is.	Ya tabbata ita ce.
We do not have time.	Ba mu da lokaci.
But you did not write.	Amma ba ku rubuta ba.
You are in the past.	Kun kasance a baya.
Time went by slowly.	Lokaci ya tafi a hankali.
Enjoy watching for a moment.	Yi sha'awar kallon na ɗan lokaci.
She never spoke again.	Bata sake magana ba.
Very few at first.	Mutane kaɗan ne da farko.
Amazing things are happening here.	Abubuwa masu ban mamaki suna faruwa a nan.
I left it.	Na bar shi.
But be careful.	Amma ku kasance damu.
Injury to a person.	Rauni ga mutum.
They did not.	Ba su yi haka ba.
There is no mistake.	Babu kuskure.
These are of course.	Waɗannan ba shakka ba ne.
They are all written carefully.	Duk an rubuta su a hankali.
I want you to talk to us.	Ina so ku yi magana da mu.
Without real effort.	Ba tare da ƙoƙarin gaske ba.
One per year is too much.	Daya a kowace shekara yana da yawa.
I told him to stop and let me look.	Na ce masa ya tsaya bari na duba.
She will leave you early.	Za ta bar ku da wuri.
Yet they can do nothing about it.	Amma duk da haka babu abin da za su iya yi game da shi.
What happened.	Abin da ya faru.
Sorry to hear the news of insomnia.	Yi hakuri da jin labarin rashin barci.
We will make sure you arrive safely where you are.	Za mu tabbatar da cewa kun isa lafiya a inda kuke.
I took it lightly.	Na dauka a hankali.
He knows too.	Ya sani kuma.
And they just have to be paid.	Kuma dole ne a biya su kawai.
We want to get it.	Muna so mu samu.
I can not even.	Ba zan iya ko da.
All go on.	Duk ku ci gaba.
It was on my own.	Ya kasance akan nawa.
At the time, things weren’t going that way.	A lokacin, abubuwa ba a yi su ta hanya ba.
Amazing inside.	Abin mamaki a ciki.
And how we feel.	Da kuma yadda muke jin dadi.
I'll give it a lot.	Zan ba shi da yawa.
One thing he knows is the timing of the trip.	Wani abu da ya sani shine lokacin tafiya yayi.
My train is late.	Jirgin kasa na ya makara.
He said.	Ya fad'a.
It does not fit to speak.	Ba ta dace da magana ba.
You will see it is a fast car.	Za ku ga ita mota ce mai sauri.
You will feel married to him.	Za ku ji aure da shi.
I hope you will come.	Ina fata za ku zo.
They come, they go, and when they go they are not good.	Suna zuwa, suna tafiya, kuma idan sun tafi ba su da kyau.
Maybe he should think again, but he won't.	Wataƙila ya kamata ya sake tunani, amma ba zai yi ba.
Many happen at the same time.	Da yawa suna faruwa lokaci guda.
Children do not need to grow up as they think, perhaps, they should.	Yara ba sa buƙatar girma kamar yadda suke tunani, watakila, ya kamata.
There are so many things you do not understand yet.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ba ku gane ba tukuna.
Everything went on his own.	Komai ya tafi a kansa.
I think they did really well.	Ina tsammanin sun yi kyau sosai.
He has no dog.	Ba shi da kare.
Probably not.	Wataƙila ba haka ba ne.
I want to leave it at that.	Ina so in bar shi a haka.
They never needed two.	Ba su taɓa buƙatar biyu ba.
I'm not going to kill you please don't worry too much.	Ba zan kashe ka ba don Allah kar ka damu da yawa.
You must hear it with everyone.	Dole ne ku ji shi tare da kowa.
He must want the best.	Dole ne ya so mafi kyau.
She, too, is intelligent.	Ita ma tana da hankali.
That would be nice.	Da hakan yayi kyau.
I need it.	Ni ne yake bukata.
It will not work.	Ba zai yi aiki ba.
You have done this many times.	Kun yi hakan sau da yawa.
Don't miss it now.	Kar a rasa shi yanzu.
The hand made him rise.	Hannu yasa ya tashi.
Whatever it was, it looked so close.	Duk abin da yake, ya yi kama da kusa.
He did things.	Ya yi abubuwa.
But it is not good.	Amma ba shi da kyau.
We live in the past now and in the future.	Muna rayuwa a baya yanzu da kuma nan gaba.
You come.	Kun zo.
And that is exactly what he wants.	Kuma wannan shine ainihin abin da yake so.
I can talk to anyone about anything.	Zan iya magana da kowa game da komai.
They will kill me.	Za su kashe ni.
This is a good job!	Wannan kyakkyawan aiki ne!
All you have to do is proceed as before.	Duk abin da za ku yi shi ne ci gaba kamar da.
They fought.	Sun yi fada.
This is common.	Wannan na kowa ne.
At first it was not good.	Da farko ba shi da kyau.
I called everyone.	Na kira kowa.
But they were not as she had always been.	Amma ba su kasance kamar yadda ta taɓa gani ba.
Actually I don't need that.	A gaskiya bana bukatar wannan.
Are you with me?	Kuna tare da ni?.
I don't want to talk to you.	Bana son magana da ku.
It will never be.	Ba zai taba zama ba.
But then it became the norm.	Amma sai ya zama abu na yau da kullum.
And whatever it is, everything will be fine.	Kuma duk abin da yake, komai zai yi kyau.
He can not.	Ba zai iya ba.
They are happy.	Suna jin daɗi .
I have to hurry.	Dole ne in yi sauri.
The water will be cold and will definitely need cold.	Ruwan zai yi sanyi kuma tabbas yana buƙatar sanyi.
Let's meet tonight.	Mu hadu a daren yau.
This took a lot of time.	Wannan ya ɗauki lokaci mai yawa.
Try this twice.	Gwada hakan sau biyu.
Don't be late.	Kar ku makara.
That doesn't make sense.	Hakan ba haka yake ba da ji.
I was paid too.	An biya ni ma.
They stopped slowly.	Sun tsaya a hankali.
She thought she was dead.	Ta dauka ta mutu.
There is still something to do.	Har yanzu akwai sauran abin yi.
She went home.	Ta tafi gida.
I'm still scared.	Ina jin tsoro har yanzu.
Now is not the time though.	Yanzu ba lokacin ba ne ko da yake.
I myself have not encountered it.	Ni da kaina ban ci karo da shi ba.
I use them.	Ina amfani da su.
The teacher helps the children to read.	Malamin yana taimaka wa yara su karanta.
So you know how we fly early.	Don haka kun san yadda muke tashi da wuri.
Now there is no problem.	Yanzu babu matsala.
This is a surprise for us.	Wannan abin mamaki ne a gare mu.
But let's think together.	Amma bari mu yi tunani tare.
They took the wrong person.	Sun dauki mutumin da bai dace ba.
Nothing was lost.	Ba a rasa komai ba.
I can understand it.	Ina iya gane shi.
Great too.	Babban kuma.
But together, you have something really interesting.	Amma tare, kuna da wani abu mai ban sha'awa sosai.
Before you get there.	Kafin ka isa wurin.
If you want to see.	Idan kuna son gani.
I speak from the truth.	Ina magana daga gaskiya.
You can work alone.	Kuna iya aiki kai kaɗai.
That's what they look like.	Haka suke kama.
We have to talk about what happened.	Dole ne mu yi magana game da abin da ya faru.
He did not think.	Bai yi tunani ba.
He was not killed again.	Ba a sake kashe shi ba.
I was very happy.	Na yi matukar farin ciki sosai.
Only one person was allowed to leave immediately.	Mutum daya ne kawai aka bari ya tafi nan take.
So not yet.	Don haka ba tukuna.
No, she would not bring it.	A'a, ba za ta kawo shi ba.
It's not easy, of course.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba, ba shakka.
We know what to do.	Mun san abin da za mu yi.
People think of them.	Mutane suna tunanin su.
You can hear them fighting.	Za ka ji suna fada.
So we have.	Don haka muna da.
You are not well.	Ba ka da lafiya.
I was still surprised early.	Na yi mamaki har yanzu da wuri.
This process is more advanced than the last.	Wannan hanya ta ci gaba fiye da na ƙarshe.
She will be fine.	Zata lafiya.
He never knew enough.	Bai taba isa sani ba.
It should not be done.	Bai kamata a yi shi ba.
Today it is hot.	Yau yayi zafi.
I'm not talking to her.	Ba na magana da ita.
It's time to fight.	Lokacin fada yayi.
He grew up.	Ya girma.
It is not selfish.	Ba son kai ba ne.
He said he wanted the police to be called.	Sai ya ce yana son a kira ‘yan sanda ya tafi.
He came looking for us after the meeting.	Ya zo neman mu bayan taron.
I came to accept.	Na zo na yarda.
Please take the money.	Da fatan za a ɗauki kuɗin.
They make a lot of mistakes.	Suna samun kuskure sosai.
Everything he said was fine.	Duk abin da ya fada yana da kyau.
It appears to me now.	Ya bayyana a gare ni yanzu.
But a little.	Amma kadan.
Not always.	Ba kowane lokaci ba.
How do you kill him?	Yaya za ku kashe shi?
He did not drink himself.	Bai sha da kansa ba.
I was the one who was very happy with the way things were.	Ni daya na yi matukar farin ciki yadda abubuwa suka kasance.
No matter how you feel about it.	Duk da yadda za ku ji game da shi.
Not just people like me.	Ba kawai mutane kamar ni ba.
In the end we live beyond what we see and hear now.	A ƙarshe muna rayuwa fiye da abin da muke gani da ji a yanzu.
Great man.	Babban mutum.
She slammed the door.	Ta fad'a a k'ofar gidan.
I don't get anything.	Ba na samun komai.
That's it.	Wannan ya yi.
That was the first thought.	Wannan shine tunanin farko.
You’ve been doing well, just keep doing what you’re doing.	Kun kasance kuna yin kyau, kawai ku ci gaba da yin abin da kuke yi.
I also brought this to you.	Ni ma na kawo muku wannan.
What is right is what she did with them '.	Abin da ya dace shine abin da ta yi da su'.
Each seat is taken.	An dauki kowane wurin zama.
He told himself so.	Ya fada wa kansa haka.
I don’t know exactly how to get into this.	Ban san ainihin yadda zan shiga cikin wannan ba.
I saw that.	Na ga haka.
Health care is difficult.	Kula da lafiya shine mai wahala.
Please do not go with me, let me go by myself.	Don Allah kar ku tafi tare da ni, bari in tafi da kaina.
No, of course not.	A'a, tabbas shi ne.
It is all external to the problem.	Duk na waje ne ga matsalar.
They are not like drinking.	Ba su zama kamar sha ba.
And that will happen often.	Kuma hakan zai faru sau da yawa.
I asked him if he needed to talk?	Na tambaye shi ko yana bukatar magana?
We need to give them a chance to grow.	Muna bukatar mu ba su damar girma.
It just runs the wrong way.	Yana kawai gudu ba daidai ba hanya.
The train arrived at the station.	Jirgin ya isa tashar.
I feel good.	Na ji dadi.
But that scared me.	Amma abin ya bani tsoro.
This was as follows.	Wannan ya kasance kamar haka.
We can’t expect the injured to get up and start walking.	Ba za mu iya tsammanin wanda ya ji rauni ya tashi ya fara tafiya ba.
I hope they succeed.	Ina fatan sun yi nasara.
The same pleasure left me.	Jin daɗi ɗaya ya bar ni.
She certainly did not miss anything.	Lallai ba ta rasa komai ba.
We took care of her until morning.	Muka kula da ita har safe.
Without it nothing will happen.	Idan babu shi babu abin da zai faru.
It's amazing that it's still happening.	Yana da ban mamaki cewa har yanzu yana faruwa.
Give an answer.	Ka ba da amsa.
I went from knowledge to consciousness.	Na tafi daga sani zuwa sani.
There are more than ever.	Akwai su fiye da kowane lokaci.
I think it will be done.	Ina tsammanin za a yi haka.
They know what to do.	Sun san abin da za su yi.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a bayyana wanda za a iya kashe a gaba ba.
It makes you think.	Yana sa ku tunani.
I know where he grew up.	Na san inda ya girma.
I'm just telling you.	Ina gaya muku haka kawai.
I was about to leave when someone called me.	Ina shirin fara tafiya sai wani ya kira ni.
No one wants to be laughed at.	Ba wanda ke son a yi masa dariya.
It will only take time.	Zai ɗauki lokaci kawai.
You are only human, whether you like it or not.	Kai mutum ne kawai, ko kana so ko ba ka so.
They are on their way.	Suna kan hanya.
I never drank them.	Ban taba shan su ba.
Do not worry too much about your diet.	Kada ku damu da yawa game da abincin ku.
It is only real if two people hear it.	Wani abu ne kawai na gaske idan mutane biyu sun ji shi.
Truth is truth.	Gaskiya ita ce gaskiya.
I never wanted to go there in the first place.	Ban taba son zuwa wurin ba tun da farko.
I could not recognize him.	Ba zan iya gane shi ba.
Even for a little while.	Ko da na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
The reason was good.	Dalilin ya kasance mai kyau.
She must be on time.	Dole ne ta kasance akan lokaci.
She went a second time.	Ta tafi karo na biyu.
Something that must be done at the same time.	Wani abu da dole ne a yi lokaci guda.
Like a train on the road.	Kamar jirgin kasa akan hanya.
You know you want one.	Ka san kana son daya.
Lots to eat for lunch.	Da yawa don cin abincin rana.
Now is his time.	Yanzu lokacin sa ne.
She quickly disappeared.	Da sauri ta bata.
But he never said much.	Amma bai taba cewa da yawa ba.
I immediately made money.	Nan take na yi kudi.
He could never tell her that.	Bai taba iya gaya mata haka ba.
I'm in trouble here.	Ina cikin matsala a nan.
We can't fix this place.	Ba za mu iya gyara wannan wurin ba.
I stayed there.	Na zauna a can.
I can accept it.	Zan iya yarda da shi.
It is better not to think too much about this.	Zai fi kyau kar a yi tunani sosai game da wannan.
That cannot happen.	Hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
You have to be careful, though.	Dole ne ku kula, ko da yake.
But if.	Amma idan.
I don’t know anyone who can, but maybe they can.	Ban san wani wanda zai iya ba, amma watakila suna iya.
We can go.	Za mu iya tafiya.
He told me where he was going.	Ya fada inda yake tafiya.
I also want him to have the same passion.	Ina kuma son ya sami irin wannan sha'awa.
Fix and do.	Gyara kuma yi.
You are a role model for him.	Kai ne abin koyi a gare shi.
The game is everything.	Wasan shine komai.
He certainly did not plan to stay in it.	Lallai bai shirya zama a ciki ba.
Children always get into trouble.	Yara kullum suna shiga cikin matsala.
You are not the first.	Ba kai ne na farko ba.
It's too low.	An yi kasa kasa.
I have no plans to change my game.	Ban shirya canza wasa na ba.
Now we know he didn't take it.	Yanzu mun san bai dauka ba.
Forget all this.	Manta da wannan duka.
He did not care.	Bai kula ba.
I just got it.	Na sami haka kawai.
I have come to tell you something.	Na zo ne in gaya muku wani abu.
I do not want one.	Ban so daya.
I was badly injured.	Na yi mummunan rauni.
But that is not why we are here.	Amma ba shine dalilin da yasa muke nan ba.
He did just that.	Ya yi daidai da haka.
That can't be.	Wannan ba zai iya zama ba.
It does not.	Ba ya yi.
I will not leave it.	Ba zan bar shi ba.
And I don’t believe I can remove it.	Kuma ban yarda ba zan iya cire shi.
She came.	Ta zo.
They are still looking for us.	Har yanzu suna neman mu.
They were very fast.	Sun yi sauri sosai.
After all, there is definitely not much.	Bayan haka, tabbas babu wani abu da yawa.
Once or twice he would walk home.	Ko sau daya ko sau biyu ya yi ta tafiya gida.
Ask them if they would like something to drink.	Ka tambaye su ko suna son wani abu su sha.
He thinks the plan is a waste of time.	Yana ganin shirin bata lokaci ne.
What we find is that this is not true.	Abin da muke gano shi ne cewa wannan ba daidai ba ne.
No, more so.	A'a, fiye da haka.
But do not do all this to yourself too much.	Amma kada ku yi wa kanku duka game da wannan da yawa.
He raised his hand and gave the correct answer.	Ya daga hannu ya ba da amsa daidai.
I hated it, but she had to get it.	Na ƙi shi, amma dole ne ta samu.
But they are not the same.	Amma ba ɗaya ba ne.
I am with the ship.	Ina tare da jirgin.
Otherwise read once and finish.	In ba haka ba ka karanta sau ɗaya kuma ka gama.
There are so many things.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa.
I agree that there could be a problem.	Na yarda cewa za a iya samun matsala.
I think you are right about that.	Ina ganin kun yi daidai kan hakan.
They are ready and waiting.	Sun shirya suna jira.
Which is not what happens.	Wanda ba shine abin da ke faruwa ba.
I think you need some time alone.	Ina tsammanin kuna buƙatar ɗan lokaci ku kaɗai.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Amma hakan bai yi kama da gaskiya ba.
There are so many things at the same time.	Abubuwa ne da yawa a lokaci guda.
He saw two people in the car.	Ya ga mutane biyu a cikin motar.
This is very interesting.	Wannan yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
I never did anything to her.	Ban taba yi mata komai ba.
Inside, though, a second.	Ciki, ko da yake, na biyu.
It took me a while.	Ya ɗauki ni ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
We know that participate.	Mun san cewa shiga.
I know everyone is worried about that.	Na san kowa ya damu da hakan.
Or even what it is.	Ko ma menene shi.
I myself did nothing.	Ni kaina ban yi komai ba.
And this time is no better than now.	Kuma wannan lokaci bai fi na yanzu ba.
Just a day or two.	Kwana ɗaya ko biyu kawai.
They were completely wrong for each other.	Sun kasance gaba ɗaya kuskure ga juna.
Never entered the place.	Ba a taɓa shiga wurin ba.
Are you in the game today?	Kuna cikin wasan yau?.
Enough to know and fear.	Ya isa ya sani kuma ku ji tsoro.
It’s good to worry if you lose.	Yana da kyau ka damu idan ka rasa.
So they did not.	Don haka ba su yi ba.
Nothing here, nothing.	Babu komai a nan, babu komai.
It will help us.	Zai taimake mu.
I was immediately arrested.	Nan take suka kama ni.
Though, he thought, he would never find another.	Ko da yake, ya yi tunani, ba zai taɓa samun wani ba.
They like to sleep.	Suna son yin barci.
Time goes on.	Lokaci yana ci gaba.
I know you will be back.	Na san za ku dawo.
She continued to work.	Ta ci gaba da aiki.
Eat healthy and stay healthy.	Ku ci abinci mai lafiya kuma ku zauna lafiya.
However, there is a place to stay.	Duk da haka akwai wurin da mutum zai tsaya a wurin.
How many do that.	Nawa yi haka.
I never knew what to say.	Ban taba sanin abin da zan ce ba.
You know it's going to hurt, but you can't look it.	Ka san tabbas zai yi rauni, amma ba za ka iya duba ba.
But without a doubt, someone will get involved.	Amma ba tare da shakka ba, wani zai shiga ciki.
This is something for me.	Wannan wani abu ne a gare ni.
After that they met several times to go out together.	Bayan haka sun hadu sau da yawa don fita tare.
School night.	Daren makaranta.
I want to hear everything.	Ina so in ji komai.
I will tell you now.	Zan gaya muku yanzu.
I know what to do.	Na san abin da zan yi.
Whatever if.	Duk idan shi.
They are lying to us.	Karya suke mana.
We will do this.	Za mu yi wannan.
Please join us for a drink.	Da fatan za a kasance tare da mu don sha.
I do not need.	bana bukata.
So, what will happen to you?	Don haka, menene zai faru da ku?
That's the end of it.	Karshen kenan.
I have a child at home.	Ina da yaro a gida.
And it comes with heat.	Kuma yana zuwa da zafi.
Way out.	Hanyar fita.
He saw the truth about himself.	Ya ga gaskiya game da kansa.
He knew better than to wait.	Ya fi sanin abin da zai jira.
And besides, it doesn't take you three.	Kuma baya ga haka, bai kai ku uku ba.
It is very difficult to lose a child.	Yana da matukar wuya a rasa yaro.
I asked how long he had been there.	Na tambayi tsawon lokacin da ya yi a wurin.
Now it is time for me to say.	Yanzu lokaci ya yi da zan ce.
So you have to trust me.	Don haka dole ne ku yarda da ni.
That was it.	Wannan ya kasance.
It's about growth.	Yana da game da girma.
You have to be kids', you know.	Dole ne ku zama yara ', kun sani.
They tried everything.	Sun gwada komai.
Slowly she looked at the empty house.	A hankali ta kalli gidan da babu kowa.
Go ahead.	Wuce ta gaba.
Don't worry too much about it.	Kar ka damu da shi sosai.
He wanted to touch her.	Ya so ya taba ta.
I can't refuse.	Ba zan iya ƙi ba.
It seems to be working fine.	Da alama hakan yana aiki lafiya.
He tries, but he is behind.	Yana ƙoƙari, amma ya kasance a baya.
Okay, go ahead.	Lafiya, ci gaba gaba.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
Something will happen tomorrow.	Wani abu zai faru gobe.
You definitely have something to tell me.	Babu shakka kuna da abin da za ku gaya mani.
You remember it all.	Kuna tuna shi duka.
In the car.	A cikin mota.
Things like.	Abubuwa kamar .
However, many are only planning to travel so far.	Duk da haka, da yawa sun shirya kawai don tafiya zuwa yanzu.
They love me there.	Suna son ni a can.
What we know to be true is not true.	Abin da muka san gaskiya ba gaskiya ba ne.
Let this show.	Bari wannan ya nuna.
If you do, this is for you.	Idan kun yi, wannan a gare ku ne.
Everyone knows how to do that.	Kowa ya san yadda ya kamata a yi haka.
Even talking back.	Ko da magana baya.
She's not here, of course.	Ba ta nan, tabbas.
I can't do this.	Ba zan iya yin wannan ba.
That could not happen.	Hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
You do too.	Kuna yi ma.
They are very involved.	Suna da hannu sosai.
Bring your buyers to see!	Kawo masu siyan ku ku duba!.
You can explain this immediately by looking at it.	Za ku iya bayyana hakan nan da nan ta hanyar kallon ta.
Be amazing, everyone !.	Kasance mai ban mamaki, kowa da kowa!.
After he finished he finished.	Bayan ya gama ya gama.
I also remember something she said.	Ni ma na tuna wani abu da ta ce.
Wait for the bus, or you will miss it.	Jira bas, ko za ku rasa ta.
That could be it.	Wannan yana iya zama shi.
Some begin to cry.	Wasu suka fara kuka.
It is always on time.	Koyaushe yana kan lokaci sosai.
One person has the best chance.	Mutum daya yana da mafi kyawun damar.
Not really, he realized.	Ba da gaske ba, ya gane.
Everyone else is gone.	Duk sauran sun tafi.
We just have to think about who we are going to start with.	Dole ne kawai mu yi tunanin wanda za mu fara da shi.
It runs very fast, everything is working properly.	Tana gudu sosai, komai yana aiki yadda ya kamata.
Of course he was.	Tabbas ya kasance.
It seems to be working.	Da alama yana aiki.
That is for sure.	Abin da ya tabbata.
They will pass through it.	Za su wuce ta sama.
Some like it.	Wasu suna son shi.
That should not be the case.	Wannan bai kamata ya kasance haka ba.
Let's go out to dinner today.	Mu fita cin abincin dare yau.
One of these is homeless.	Ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan ba shi da gida.
He did not leave her.	Bai bar ta ba.
She has to keep working.	Dole ta ci gaba da aiki.
We hope the house will be closed next year.	Muna fatan za a rufe gidan nan da shekara mai zuwa.
Don’t just give your money away without a fight.	Kada ku ba da kuɗin ku kawai ba tare da faɗa ba.
And we didn’t get a week.	Kuma ba mu samu mako guda ba.
We refuse to do so here.	Mun ƙi yin haka a nan.
This should not happen for a month.	Hakan bai kamata ya faru ba har tsawon wata guda.
Don't do that again.	Kar a sake yin hakan.
I don't understand anything that happened tonight.	Ban gane wani abu da ya faru a daren nan ba.
But, yes, school uniforms have always been my favorite.	Amma, a, kayan makaranta koyaushe abin fi so na.
No one wants to come here, we know that.	Babu wanda ke son zuwa nan, mun san hakan.
And we will talk about that for a moment.	Kuma za mu yi magana game da hakan a ɗan lokaci.
What everyone would like.	Abin da kowa zai so.
I have to help them.	Dole ne in taimake su.
She immediately wanted it.	Nan take ta so shi.
Okay, ask him.	Yayi kyau, ka tambaye shi.
I will not give this to anyone.	Ba zan ba kowa wannan ba.
This makes them feel safe.	Wannan ya sa su ji lafiya.
I did not ask to stay.	Ban nemi zama ba.
Maybe there.	Wataƙila akwai.
It will help.	Zai taimaka.
I think they finally enjoyed it.	Ina tsammanin a ƙarshe sun ji daɗi.
I was afraid of what would happen.	Na ji tsoron abin da zai faru.
It may miss something in it.	Yana iya rasa wani abu a ciki.
We can't keep going like that.	Ba za mu iya ci gaba da tafiya haka ba.
It was laughable, though.	An yi dariya, ko da yake.
But if you come back here, we will kill you.	Amma idan kun dawo nan, za mu kashe ku.
You can still walk you know.	Har yanzu kuna iya tafiya da kuka sani.
It has happened in the past, and it will happen again in the future.	Ya faru a baya, kuma zai sake faruwa a nan gaba.
That surprised us.	Abin ya ba mu mamaki.
There is.	Akwai.
One does not know.	Mutum bai sani ba .
It gets better from there.	Yana samun kyau daga can.
He got up and left, no doubt looking for water.	Ya tashi ya tafi, babu shakka yana neman ruwa.
I enjoyed how these came out.	Na ji daɗin yadda waɗannan suka fito.
I live there.	Ina zaune a can.
I just have you.	Ina da ku kawai.
Wonder who thinks so.	Mamaki wanda yayi tunanin haka.
Everyone is filming on film, film in film.	Kowane mutum yana yin fim a kan fim, fim a cikin fim.
She always cared about others.	Kullum ta damu da wasu.
We do not agree.	Ba mu yarda ba.
But she also needs it.	Amma kuma tana matukar bukatar hakan.
She asked us what was going on.	Ta tambaye mu me ke faruwa.
She knew what he was planning.	Ta san me ya shirya.
They know this.	Sun san wannan.
Not surprisingly, perhaps.	Ba abin mamaki bane, watakila.
Maybe that's a sign.	Wataƙila wannan alama ce.
I don't remember that, but we can do well.	Ban tuna da haka ba, amma muna iya da kyau.
He likes to work outside.	Yana son yin aiki a waje.
We will pay.	Za mu biya.
What, shine.	Menene, shine.
The amount of money spent.	An kashe kuɗin kuɗin da aka kashe.
He did not say where.	Bai ce ina ba.
If.	Idan .
No one has come to the house yet.	Har yanzu babu wanda ya zo gidan.
You are surprised.	Kuna mamaki.
I know the two of you are very close.	Na san ku biyu kun kasance kusa sosai.
They love each other very much.	Suna son juna sosai.
That you go with him.	Da ka tafi tare da shi.
He is a wonderful man.	Wani mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
For you and the rest.	Don ku da sauran.
You do not have to go alone.	Bai kamata ku tafi kadai ba.
And it closed.	Kuma ya rufe.
He didn't want to leave.	Ba abin da yake so sai ya bar wurin.
She did not know.	Ba ta sani ba.
And we must.	Kuma dole ne mu.
As the saying goes.	Kamar yadda take ya fada.
I could make a mistake though.	Zan iya yin kuskure ko da yake.
Like, everyone knows that.	Kamar, kowa ya san haka.
He could have someone else.	Zai iya samun wani.
I want to know.	Ina so in sani.
That's very good.	Hakan yayi kyau sosai.
It is life, and it is heavenly.	Rai ne, kuma na sama ne.
Explain that real life is there.	Bayyana cewa ainihin rayuwa tana can.
There is nothing like it here.	Babu wani abu mai kama da shi a nan.
This game can be played with others.	Ana iya buga wannan wasan tare da wasu.
She was in the same boat.	Tana cikin jirgin ruwa guda.
One is not written.	Ba a rubuta ɗaya ba.
They don't want me around.	Ba su so ni a kusa.
I think we will.	Ina jin za mu yi.
Right, however.	Dama ce, duk da haka.
But no one wanted to.	Amma ba wanda ya so.
She seemed worried.	Ta yi kamar ta damu.
I will leave this to the next task.	Zan bar wannan zuwa aiki na gaba.
I'm right there.	Ina nan daidai.
They know where we are going.	Sun san inda za mu je.
There is definitely no way.	Babu shakka babu hanya.
You think you know what they are up to.	Kuna tsammanin kun san abin da suke ciki.
Not because we need to keep kids going.	Ba don muna buƙatar ci gaba da yara ba.
He is just a human being.	Mutum ne kawai.
Then the world came back to normal.	Sai duniya ta dawo cikin hankali.
It is always open at night.	Kullum yana bude dare.
There is not much time left for me.	Babu sauran lokaci da yawa a gare ni.
It seems to be non-existent.	Da alama babu shi.
Please do not let a bad end come to her.	Don Allah kar a yi mummunan ƙarshe zo mata.
I did not find out until later.	Ban gano ba sai bayan haka.
There is something new.	Akwai wani sabon abu.
They are in the bathroom.	Suna bayan gida.
It should be prepared ahead of time.	Ya kamata a shirya kafin lokacin.
But she is.	Amma ita ce.
He knows how to do that, a lot of things.	Ya san yadda ake yin haka, abubuwa da yawa.
There they returned to spend the night.	Nan suka koma inda suka kwana.
We had a really good time.	Mun sami lokaci mai daɗi da gaske.
You can totally, too.	Za ku iya gaba ɗaya, ma.
You catch something as it is.	Kuna kama abu kamar yadda yake.
Horror film.	Fim mai ban tsoro.
That's what he called it.	Abin da ya kira shi ke nan.
I'll be around, don't worry.	Zan kasance a kusa, kada ku damu.
Probably not.	Wataƙila hakan ba zai kasance ba.
We must learn to live together.	Dole ne mu koyi zama tare.
Now we are together again.	Yanzu muna tare kuma.
And I don't think things went well.	Kuma bana jin abin ya tafi da kyau.
The dress made her look good.	Rigar ta yi mata kyau.
You will not die.	Ba za ku mutu ba.
I hope you enjoy it.	Ina fatan za ku ji daɗi.
All you have to do is sit down and get enough.	Duk abin da za ku yi shi ne zama kuma ya isa.
In fact, he was.	A gaskiya ma, ya kasance.
It's just hard.	Wahala ce kawai.
So, you know, we have to see.	Don haka, ka sani, dole ne mu gani.
Enough is enough.	Wanda ya isa ya isa.
It is very difficult to think very clearly.	Yana da wuya a yi tunani sosai.
I have to defend myself.	Dole na kare kaina.
Go slowly.	Tafi a hankali.
That wouldn’t want any of that.	Wannan ba zai so wani abu daga cikin wannan ba.
I started laughing.	Na fara dariya.
This is what should happen.	Abin da ya kamata ya faru ke nan.
When he showed up, it was too late.	Lokacin da ya nuna, ya makara.
The door is closed.	An rufe kofar.
Probably in this person.	Tabbas a cikin wannan mutumin.
Don't give up, she said.	Kar ka bari, in ji ta.
You do not have to do anything.	Ba sai ka yi komai ba.
Take plenty of water.	Ɗauki ruwa mai yawa.
I still live there.	Har yanzu ina zaune a can.
No one can catch him.	Babu wanda zai iya kama shi.
That has changed over time.	Hakan ya canza da lokaci.
This is also good.	Wannan kuma ya yi kyau.
After the plane took off he left.	Bayan jirgin ya tashi ya tafi.
They need to be together.	Suna bukatar zama tare.
Doing it is my thing.	Yin abu na ne.
It is the best !.	Shi ne mafi kyau!.
We wanted to do this.	Mun so mu yi wannan.
I can't think of anyone.	Ba zan iya tunanin kowa ba.
I will help you, though, if you will help me.	Zan taimake ku, ko da yake, idan za ku taimake ni.
I want to stay on the boat because it feels safe.	Ina so in zauna a cikin jirgin ruwa saboda yana jin lafiya.
Everyone is equal.	Kowa daidai yake.
She has to go.	Dole ta tafi.
I'll pay you to go to school.	Zan biya ku ku tafi makaranta.
The latter replied.	Na karshen ya amsa.
Heat is applied and released.	Ana amfani da zafi kuma an sake shi.
I am still one of the 'us'.	Har yanzu ina daya daga cikin 'mu'.
I usually drink a lot of coffee.	Kullum ina shan kofi da yawa.
That could be.	Hakan na iya zama.
That should not be the case.	Bai kamata hakan ya kasance a can ba.
And that should not come as a surprise.	Kuma wannan bai kamata ya zo da mamaki ba.
Doing so can be very difficult for a person.	Yin hakan na iya zama da wahala ga mutum.
Maybe that time is gone.	Watakila wannan lokacin ya tafi.
Everything is in place, he said.	Komai ya kasance inda ya kamata, in ji shi.
We went there on the bus.	Mun je can a kan bas.
Well, we will start from the beginning again.	Da kyau, za mu fara daga farko kuma.
But we know what today brings at the same time.	Amma mun san abin da yau ke kawo daidai wannan lokacin.
I do not buy.	Ba na saya.
And now they are even better than before.	Kuma yanzu sun ma fi yadda suke a da.
We know how to do it better than anyone.	Mun san yadda za mu yi shi fiye da kowa.
Let me explain something.	Bari in bayyana wani abu.
We will not die waiting, not today.	Ba za mu mutu da jira ba, ba yau ba.
He wanted to take her.	Ya so ya tafi da ita.
You need it now.	Kuna buƙatar shi a yanzu.
But she knew she had to try.	Amma ta san dole ta gwada.
We have nothing to do with it.	Ba mu da abin da za mu yi da shi.
It would be nice.	Zai yi kyau.
I suggest we try another method.	Ina ba da shawarar mu gwada wata hanya.
No one knows what they are doing.	Babu wanda ya san abin da suke yi.
Cut the core.	Yanke ainihin.
Just something else.	Kawai akwai wani abu kuma.
It's in her.	Yana cikin ta.
Yet later, there was her.	Amma duk da haka daga baya, akwai ta.
All work is left alone.	Ana barin yin duk aikin shi kaɗai.
Quickly she flew up.	Da sauri ta tashi sama.
I didn't really last long.	Ban dade da gaske ba.
They continued sailing by boat.	Suka ci gaba da tafiya ta jirgin ruwa a sama.
Maybe other things like that.	Wataƙila wasu abubuwa kamar haka ne.
You girls better stay here now.	Ku 'yan mata gara ku zauna a nan yanzu.
It's too much for me.	Ya yi min yawa.
Three hits and you're out!	Uku ya buga kuma kun fita!
It was hard work, but we succeeded.	Aiki ne mai wuya, amma mun yi nasara.
Growing up this time.	Girma wannan lokacin.
It was printed fine.	An buga lafiya.
You want something better.	Kuna son wani abu mafi kyau.
He has understood this for years.	Ya fahimci haka tsawon shekaru.
Please can someone tell me the best way to do this.	Don Allah wani zai iya gaya mani hanya mafi kyau don yin wannan.
It took her a long time before she heard it was being used.	Sai da ta dauki tsawon lokaci kafin ta ji an yi amfani da ita.
It doesn't seem to increase your size or anything.	Ba kamar yana kara maka girma ko wani abu ba.
I am not afraid of anyone.	Ba na tsoron wani mutum.
We grew distrustful of each other.	Mun girma rashin yarda da juna.
Do what works for you.	Yi abin da ya dace da ku.
It will make him happy.	Zai sa ya ji daɗi.
I'll fix it the way she wants.	Zan gyara yadda take so.
I have never felt so cold.	Ban taba jin sanyi haka ba.
We grew up close.	Mun girma kusa.
It has to be the right thing to do.	Dole ne ya zama abin da ya dace.
I write from them.	Ina rubuta daga gare su.
They are good to eat.	Sun yi kyau su ci.
Good sign.	Kyakkyawan alama.
I feel amazing.	Ina jin ban mamaki.
I could not say.	Na kasa fada.
The book is very good.	Littafin yayi kyau sosai.
She also worked on the book she wrote.	Ta kuma yi aiki a kan littafin da ta rubuta.
I knew she would do well.	Na san za ta yi kyau.
Time to travel home.	Lokacin tafiya gida.
Nothing more.	Babu wani abu kuma.
It was night.	Sai dare suka yi.
She said she was.	Ta ce tana.
And that did not end there.	Kuma hakan bai kare ba.
It makes me healthy.	Yana sa ni lafiya.
I have to remind myself of this on a regular basis.	Dole ne in tuna wa kaina wannan a kai a kai.
He wants you.	Ya so ku.
He is a wonderful man.	Shi mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
Problem or happiness.	Matsala ko farin ciki.
We go to school together.	Muna makaranta tare.
Something is wrong.	Wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
But there was nothing she could do.	Amma babu abin da za ta iya yi.
You do not understand any of this.	Ba ku fahimci ko ɗaya daga cikin wannan ba.
I'm scared about it.	Ina jin tsoro game da shi.
I never thought there were so many things in it, she said.	Ban taɓa tunanin akwai abubuwa da yawa a ciki ba, in ji ta.
I think you will never eat.	Ina jin ba za ku taɓa cin abinci ba.
Take care of everything he does.	Kula da duk abin da ya yi.
I kept waiting.	Na ci gaba da jira.
I do not know, anything else.	Ban sani ba, wani abu kuma.
He just thought everything would go well.	Ya dan yi tunanin komai zai tafi.
I will be happy.	Zan yi farin ciki.
She plans to try this again.	Ta shirya sake gwada wannan.
It was so.	Haka ya kasance haka.
They tried to sell them but failed.	Sun yi ƙoƙarin sayar da su sun kasa.
And yet can add.	Kuma duk da haka iya ƙara.
I saved it.	Na ajiye shi.
A comfortable home can make a person very happy.	Gida mai dadi yana iya sa mutum farin ciki sosai.
No one knows anything.	Babu wanda ya san komai.
That's what we saw.	Abin da muka gani ke nan.
I highly recommend !!!.	Ina ba da shawarar sosai !!!.
It just so happens.	Yana faruwa haka kawai.
We have never had such a scary year.	Ba mu taɓa samun irin wannan shekara mai ban tsoro ba.
I am on my way.	Ina kan hanya ta.
We stopped there in amazement.	Muka tsaya a can cikin mamaki.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
It needs money.	Yana bukatar kudi.
It really does happen.	Yana faruwa da gaske.
Nothing big here.	Babu babban abu a nan.
Another sky up.	Wani sama sama.
And to protect you.	Kuma ga kare ku.
Many people will be hurt.	Mutane da yawa za su ji rauni.
You do.	Kun yi.
Enough to eat.	Ya isa ya ci.
It looks great.	Yayi kama sosai.
They kept working until they closed the place.	Suna nan suna aiki har sai da suka rufe wurin.
I already know who it is.	Na riga na san ko wanene.
And there is no fighting.	Kuma babu wani fada.
I will take care of it all.	Zan kula da shi duka.
What we have is real.	Abin da muke da shi na gaske ne.
But he doesn't want to hear that.	Amma ba haka yake son ji ba.
We were only given a small amount of money.	An ba mu kuɗi kaɗan kawai.
I can do nothing but accept it.	Ba zan iya yin komai ba sai yarda da shi.
Coffee has many benefits.	Kofi yana da amfani da yawa.
I feel like a kid again.	Ina sake jin kamar yaro.
You know how it is.	Kun san yadda abin yake.
Once in a lifetime opportunity.	A sau ɗaya a cikin damar rayuwa.
The world is hot when we are healthy.	Duniya tana da zafi lokacin da muke lafiya.
There is no water.	Babu ruwa.
I don't think anyone will.	Bana jin wani zai yi.
They are not in debt.	Ba bashi bane.
And play.	Kuma ku yi wasa.
Do something about them.	Yi wani abu game da su.
I did not buy anything.	Ban sayi komai ba.
It will not do.	Ba zai yi ba.
I knew he must have been hurt.	Na san dole ne ya ji rauni.
This can never happen again.	Wannan ba zai iya sake faruwa ba.
Play your story.	Yi wasa da labarin ku.
Are you really?	Shin da gaske ku ne?
But he must try.	Amma dole ne ya gwada.
Well, we're happy with that, of course, but somehow.	Da kyau, mun yi farin ciki da hakan ba shakka, amma ko ta yaya.
He must leave us.	Dole ne ya bar mu.
It’s funny how these things work.	Yana da ban dariya yadda waɗannan abubuwa ke aiki.
I am a police officer.	Ni dan sanda ne.
No soul knows what it will be like.	Babu wata rai da ta san yadda za ta kasance.
One person died.	Mutum daya ya mutu.
Run very fast.	Gudu sosai.
Not what they say.	Ba abin da suke cewa ba.
That was a success, anyway.	Wannan ya kasance mai nasara, ko ta yaya.
As you said, it's too late.	Kamar yadda ka ce, ya makara.
Coffee is a drink.	Kofi abin sha ne.
I will continue.	Zan ci gaba.
Cannot be used.	Ba za a iya amfani da ita ba.
She laughed again.	Ta sake yin dariya.
It will make her pay.	Zai sa ta biya.
She just wants to tell me personally.	Kawai tana son ta gaya mani da kaina.
It is very hot today.	Yau yayi zafi sosai.
It continued for many years.	Ya ci gaba har tsawon shekaru da yawa.
And he will be killed.	Kuma za a kashe shi.
And just thinking about where to start.	Kuma kawai kuna tunanin inda za ku fara.
It was good to play the first game outside.	Yana da kyau mu buga wasan farko a waje.
The train arrived on time.	Jirgin ya isa kan lokaci.
It is the largest in the world.	Ita ce mafi girma a duniya.
No one can say.	Babu wanda zai iya fada.
He is the third.	Shine na uku.
He goes to whatever he wants.	Yana zuwa ga duk abin da yake so.
And he came back.	Kuma ya dawo.
I know what a hardship it is.	Na san menene wahala.
This is the best way to make this meal.	Wannan ita ce hanya mafi kyau don yin wannan abincin.
Now he is gone.	Yanzu haka ma ya tafi.
Don't just go.	Kada ku tafi kawai.
And it's scary, just scary.	Kuma abin ban tsoro ne, mai ban tsoro kawai.
Now just wait.	Yanzu ku jira kawai.
I know one thing, though.	Na san abu daya, ko da yake.
Let her do the work.	Bari ta yi aikin.
I get a lot.	Ina samun da yawa.
I just want to be alone, today.	Ina so kawai in kasance ni kaɗai, a yau.
Let them go.	Ka sa su tafi.
Everything is in a good place.	Duk abubuwan suna cikin kyakkyawan wuri.
I enjoyed this book too.	Na ji daɗin wannan littafin kuma.
So he would play with that.	Don haka zai yi wasa da hakan.
So it was confirmed.	Don haka aka tabbatar.
He is a player.	Shi dan wasa ne.
But if he knew.	Amma idan ya sani.
Just give them what they want.	Kawai a ba su abin da suke so.
Love him, love him, love him.	So shi, son shi, son shi.
I could not decide what.	Na kasa yanke shawarar menene.
These are not just fun things.	Waɗannan abubuwan ba kawai abubuwan jin daɗi ba ne.
It was not used, even after many years.	Ba a yi amfani da shi ba, ko da bayan shekaru masu yawa.
People are happy again.	Mutane sun sake yin farin ciki.
It should not be enough.	Bai kamata ya isa ba.
She laughed.	Dariya ta saka.
We only think of the event.	Muna tunanin taron ne kawai.
Only one.	Daya kawai.
Of course, everything can be fine.	Tabbas, komai na iya zama daidai.
Let him do it himself.	Bari ya yi da kansa.
You will do well.	Za ku yi kyau.
And it feels good.	Kuma yana da kyau ji.
I have money.	Ina da kudi.
Never change it.	Kada ku taɓa canza shi.
The food is very good.	Abinci yayi kyau sosai.
He would not be afraid to plan a fight with me.	Ba zai ji tsoron shirya wata gaba da ni ba.
Or maybe in the past.	Ko watakila a baya.
Here is what happened.	Abin da ke faruwa ke nan.
Just go in and have fun.	Kawai ku shiga ku ji daɗi.
That's what we did.	Haka muka yi.
Everyone hates it.	Kowa ya ƙi shi.
Not a way of life.	Ba hanyar rayuwa ba.
Too much because we don't make much money.	Ya yi yawa saboda ba mu samun kuɗi da yawa.
You will not miss the deadline, will you?	Ba za ku rasa ranar ƙarshe ba, ko?
That is enough to say.	Wannan ya isa ya ce.
Maybe she didn’t.	Wataƙila ba ta yi ba.
He is still here.	Har yanzu yana nan.
I said if you need this time, take it.	Na ce idan kuna buƙatar wannan lokacin, ku ɗauka.
This is about right.	Wannan game da daidai ne.
Day one.	Rana ta daya.
I want three of us.	Ina son mu uku.
They are good to take care of but someone can hurt.	Sun yi kyau su kula amma wani zai iya ji rauni.
You love your work.	Kuna son aikin ku.
It's still good.	Har yanzu yana da kyau.
Is it the same.	Shin daya ne.
This is so cool and amazing.	Wannan shine abin sanyi da ban mamaki.
It's a joke.	Shi abin wasa ne.
He thought about it more than he wanted to.	Ya yi tunani a kai fiye da yadda yake so.
But now you can enjoy the day.	Amma yanzu za ku iya jin daɗin rana.
This is the right approach.	Wannan ita ce hanya da ta dace.
I don’t know if it will be.	Ban sani ba idan zai kasance.
There is no way around it.	Babu wata hanya a kusa da shi.
This is the time of one month.	Wannan shine lokacin wata daya.
They are no longer afraid.	Ba su ƙara jin tsoro ba.
It's a game.	Wasa ne.
But here we are.	Amma a nan mun kasance.
Of course we will be again.	Tabbas za mu sake zama.
I enjoyed reading this article.	Na ji daɗin karanta wannan labarin.
They are in a kind of trouble.	Suna cikin wata irin matsala.
Someone is at home.	Wani yana gida.
When he was crying he asked her about it.	Da ya kasance yana kuka ya tambaye ta game da hakan.
Maybe it's good.	Wataƙila yana da kyau.
But prepare until.	Amma shirya har zuwa.
One week, maybe.	Mako guda, watakila.
We can't say anything.	Ba ma iya cewa komai ba.
They are close now.	Sun kasance kusa yanzu.
It is not available right now.	Ba a iya samun shi a yanzu.
I'm not even sure.	Ban ma tabbata ba.
So good.	Don haka mai kyau.
He too was right.	Shi ma ya yi gaskiya.
It’s about what he does.	Game da abin da yake yi ne.
You need time to think.	Kuna buƙatar lokaci don tunani.
We are close to the train station.	Muna kusa da tashar jirgin kasa.
Hope they are comfortable.	Da fatan sun ji dadi.
Must go.	Dole ne a tafi.
She thinks the same thing.	Ita ma haka take tunani.
We will no longer do anything to help.	Ba za mu ƙara yin wani abu don taimako ba.
Even if there is a way, we will never get it.	Ko da akwai wata hanya, ba za mu taɓa samun ta ba.
You will make someone equal to you.	Za ku sa wani ya zama daidai ku.
It works because we said it worked.	Yana aiki saboda mun ce ya yi aiki.
This bus stopped several times.	Wannan bas ɗin ya tsaya sau da yawa.
And you want to be touched.	Kuma kuna son a taba ku.
They are like everyone else.	Suna kamar kowa.
All they had to do was stay in place.	Abin da ya kamata kawai su kasance a wurin.
Everyone else looked amazing.	Duk sauran sun yi kama da ban mamaki.
This is my feeling.	Wannan ji na.
Otherwise it comes back broken.	In ba haka ba ya dawo karya.
Do whatever you are not comfortable with.	Yi duk abin da ba ku da dadi da shi.
We accept that he is greater than he is.	Mu yarda cewa ya fi inda yake.
I have used it for years.	Na yi amfani da shi tsawon shekaru.
We are in trouble.	Muna cikin wahala.
I can also be paid.	Zan iya kuma a biya ni.
I'm glad you don't understand what's going on.	Na yi farin ciki da ba ku fahimci abin da ke faruwa ba.
It will be reused.	Za a sake amfani da shi.
Someone like that.	Wani kamar haka.
I helped, of course.	Na yi taimako, ba shakka.
It's a question of where to start.	Magana ce ta daga ina za ku fara.
Call him on the way.	Kira shi a hanya.
That could have killed him.	Da zata iya kashe shi.
The year started well.	Shekara ta fara da kyau.
But he prepared me.	Amma ya shirya min.
It's time for dinner.	Ya isa lokacin cin abinci.
He is the first person in a month.	Shi ne mutum na farko a wata.
Of course, they want to make money.	Tabbas, suna son samun kuɗi.
If you don’t get it in a while it’s really good.	Idan ba ku samu ba a cikin ɗan lokaci yana da kyau sosai.
I refuse to go to work every day.	Na ƙi zuwa aiki kowace rana.
He stopped going to school.	Ya daina zuwa makaranta.
I just did it.	Na yi shi kawai.
And they haven’t changed it.	Kuma ba su canza shi ba.
And she asked him to stay with her.	Kuma ta tambaye shi ya zauna da ita.
Injured, but not dead.	Rauni watakila, amma bai mutu ba.
He didn't even need to touch her, just.	Bai ma bukatar taba ta ba, kawai.
I don't miss seeing that.	Ba na rasa ganin haka.
Hopefully you will make yourself at home.	Da fatan za a yi kanku a gida.
I live with it.	Ina zaune da shi.
After a while, she saw the reason.	Bayan wani lokaci, ta ga dalilin.
They kill most, if not all, of them.	Suna kashe mafi yawa, idan ba duka ba, daga ciki.
Now no one will call.	Yanzu babu wanda zai kira.
How beautiful they live.	Yaya kyau suna rayuwa.
Start cutting it.	Ka fara yanke shi.
And no one told us.	Kuma babu wanda ya gaya mana.
I know what a surprise.	Na san abin mamaki.
We can not say !.	Ba za mu iya fada ba!.
He just entered the house.	Kawai ya shiga gidan.
I'm not sure much.	Ban tabbata ba ko da yawa.
I could not enter at that time.	Ba zan iya shiga ciki ba a lokacin.
We have progressed over the years.	Mun ci gaba a cikin shekaru masu yawa.
Or maybe they even fail to explain what it is.	Ko watakila ma sun kasa bayyana abin da yake.
I just won.	Na ci nasara ne kawai.
Such people no longer live there.	Irin mutane suna daina zama a wurin.
How wonderful to be late.	Yaya ban mamaki don yin makara.
There has been a lot of talk about it.	An yi magana da yawa game da shi.
It seems that everyone is interested.	Ga alama abin da kowa ke sha'awar shi ne.
And be careful not to make mistakes.	Kuma a hankali kada ku yi kuskure.
He just said.	Kawai yace.
We are just talking here.	Mu a nan muna yin magana ne kawai.
I used to be	Na kasance
I know everything.	Na san komai.
I do not know how they can do that.	Ban san yadda za su iya yin hakan ba.
But live today.	Amma rayuwa yau.
Nothing changes if nothing changes.	Babu wani abu da ya canza idan babu abin da ya canza.
Everything there.	Komai a wurin.
And so it is.	Kamar haka ne kuma.
But it is time to say goodbye.	Amma lokaci ya yi da za a ce isa ya isa.
Now they do everything together.	Yanzu tare suke yin komai.
I should arrive now to know the best.	Ya kamata in isa yanzu don in san mafi kyau.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba abin mamaki ba ne.
And best of all, it's coffee.	Kuma mafi kyau duka, kofi ne.
We will cut it off immediately.	Za mu yanke shi nan da nan.
Not as we did.	Ba kamar yadda muka yi ba.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Two jobs.	Aiki guda biyu.
I'll get out there quickly, though.	Zan fita can cikin sauri, ko da yake.
But we know who knows.	Amma mun san wanda ya sani.
It can be anyone.	Zai iya zama kowa.
There is nothing he can do.	Babu wani abu da zai iya yi.
Now he is injured and ill.	Yanzu yana jin rauni da rashin lafiya.
And here you can leave me.	Kuma a nan kuna iya barin ni.
See you next time.	Sai mun hadu a gaba.
He is with us.	Yana tare da mu.
He gave me everything.	Ya ba ni komai.
If you had not known.	Da ba ku san haka ba.
No one came out.	Babu wanda ya fito.
Stop in the car.	Tsaya a cikin mota.
But he lost his home.	Amma ya rasa gida.
Error it.	Kuskure shi.
It seems like something out of the ordinary.	Kamar wani abu ne wanda ba shi da hankali.
I can not do this alone.	Ba zan iya yin wannan ni kaɗai ba.
The film matches the original film.	Fim ɗin yayi daidai da fim ɗin farko.
It is the third task.	Shi ne aiki na uku.
This is as it should be.	Wannan shi ne kamar yadda ya kamata.
It is on every home.	Yana kan kowane gida.
This is where you live.	Wannan shine inda kuke zama.
She has done it and can do it again.	Ta taba yi kuma za ta iya sake yin hakan.
I will be right.	Zan kasance daidai.
But it is still not finished.	Amma har yanzu ba a gama ba.
I don't know if she will.	Ban sani ba ko za ta yi.
But she fears that everything.	Amma tana tsoron cewa komai.
His house is on the way.	Gidan shi yana kan hanya.
The car is empty.	Motar babu kowa a ciki.
This is a really nice place.	Wannan wuri ne mai kyawun gaske.
I want to wait to die	Ina son jira in mutu
She just decided not to tell me.	Sai kawai ta yanke shawarar kada ta gaya mani.
Maybe they are upset.	Wataƙila sun damu.
You only get one.	Kuna samun ɗaya kawai.
It is almost non-existent.	Ya kusan babu.
We will not do anything.	Ba za mu yi komai ba.
It surprised me.	Ya bani mamaki.
He wants us to walk together and get to know each other.	Yana so mu yi tafiya tare kuma mu san juna.
He wants you to hear it.	Ya so ku ji shi.
Moreover, that there is another.	Haka kuma, cewa akwai wani.
It would be ridiculous.	Zai zama abin ban dariya.
But he is unlikely to be with us.	Amma da wuya ya kasance tare da mu.
Or to show somewhere or someone.	Ko don ya nuna wani wuri ko wani.
Certainly not.	Tabbas ba haka bane.
I want to reassure the rest of us.	Ina so in tabbatar da sauran mu.
No, he could not continue reading.	A'a, ya kasa ci gaba da karatu.
They gave it to her.	Suka ba ta.
Everyone gets it in the end.	Kowa yana samun shi a ƙarshe.
I'll see him.	Zan gani da shi.
I’m still thinking about it now, this is a wonderful place.	Har yanzu ina tunani game da shi yanzu, wannan wuri mai ban mamaki.
And it will never be.	Kuma ba zai taba zama ba.
The program will show some interesting things.	Shirin zai nuna wasu abubuwa masu ban sha'awa.
We have everything we need here.	Muna da duk abin da muke bukata a nan.
She was not at home, and the train left.	Ba ta nan a gidan, kuma jirgin ya tafi.
She went well.	Ta tafi lafiya.
I, too, have thought of this in the past.	Ni ma, na yi tunanin wannan a baya.
They could not eat one night.	Sun kasa cin abincin dare daya.
If you have one of these, send it to me.	Idan kana da ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan, aika mini.
You may be surprised at what you get.	Kuna iya mamakin abin da kuka samu.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
We all wanted to go.	Mu duka mun so mu tafi.
But maybe you will.	Amma watakila za ku yi.
If he does, it will work.	Idan ya yi, zai yi aiki.
Not a big deal, for me.	Ba babban abu ba, a gare ni.
It is easy to become accustomed to it.	Yana da sauƙi ka saba da hakan.
With the world.	Tare da duniya.
Surprisingly she could not speak.	Da mamaki ta kasa magana.
I can not accept that it is not good.	Ba zan iya yarda cewa ba shi da kyau.
We have two daughters.	Muna da 'yan mata biyu.
Even if they know her great.	Ko da sun san ta mai girma.
Your place, the way to live in the world.	Wurin ku, hanyar zama a cikin duniya.
But now he too will have a chance.	Amma yanzu shi ma zai samu dama.
Going into the game, we know what we want to do.	Shiga cikin wasan, mun san abin da muke so mu yi.
He asked for a third.	Ya nemi ya samu na uku.
I should have called her.	Ya kamata in kira ta.
We need more events.	Muna buƙatar ƙarin abubuwan da ke faruwa.
You do this.	Kuna yin wannan.
Now, hurry up!	Yanzu, yi sauri!
Some are good, some are not.	Wasu suna da kyau, wasu ba haka ba ne.
She said.	Ta fad'a.
She saw something.	Ta ga wani abu.
A car collides with a bus.	Wata mota ta yi karo da wata bas.
Somehow, they are gone now.	Ko ta yaya, sun tafi yanzu.
I am not good at such a thing.	Ba ni da kyau a irin wannan abu.
But this by the way.	Amma wannan ta hanyar.
The truth is not how you want it to be.	Gaskiya ba yadda kuke so ta kasance ba.
It's nothing.	Ba wani abu ba ne.
That may not be true.	Wannan ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
We're just in it.	Mu kawai a ciki.
However, he could not know anything about it.	Duk da haka, bai iya sanin komai game da shi ba.
This is her right.	Wannan ita ce dama ta.
Chances are, but no one got up.	An samu damar, amma babu wanda ya tashi.
I can't even begin to tell you how amazing it is.	Ba zan iya ma fara gaya muku yadda abin yake ban mamaki ba.
It wasn't until they left.	Sai da suka fita.
You are very careful.	Kuna kula sosai.
He seems hopeless.	Kamar ba shi da fata.
Still, it’s nice that he’s trying to make me feel good.	Duk da haka, yana da daɗi cewa yana ƙoƙarin sa ni jin daɗi.
I think it's just me.	Ina tsammanin ni ne kawai.
Sometimes, the problem goes somewhere else.	Wani lokaci, matsalar ta koma wani wuri.
I can talk.	Zan iya magana.
They did not.	Ba su yi haka ba.
What a wonderful surprise.	Abin mamaki mai kyau.
Without wasting time she could say he was lying.	Ba tare da bata lokaci ba ta iya cewa karya yake yi.
He does not make mistakes or anything.	Ba ya kuskure ko wani abu.
We don't move on, because we can't.	Ba mu ci gaba, saboda ba za mu iya ba.
It would be funny for me to show you.	Zai zama abin ban dariya don in nuna muku.
It will cut you off several times, killing you slowly.	Zai yanke ku sau da yawa, ya kashe ku a hankali.
He could not say why.	Ya kasa cewa dalilin tunanin haka.
Keep up the good work.	Ci gaba da aiki mai kyau.
When the water passed we looked.	Da ruwa ya wuce muka duba.
You are having a bad day.	Kuna cikin mummunan rana.
There is something about what happened.	Akwai wani abu game da abin da ya faru.
Maybe nothing here.	Wataƙila babu komai a nan.
First, you need to know the way to the place.	Da farko, kuna buƙatar sanin hanyar zuwa wurin.
He didn't care.	Bai damu ba.
They did it thirty years ago.	Sun yi shekaru talatin da suka gabata.
Not from the cold.	Ba daga sanyi ba.
Yes, it took two years.	Haka ne, ya ɗauki shekaru biyu.
So he said.	Don haka ya ce.
Even a month later it happened.	Ko bayan wata guda ma haka ta faru.
They hired someone to help me.	Sun dauki mutumin da ya taimake ni.
Do not bring any.	Kada ku kawo wani.
That is not fair.	Hakan bai dace ba.
Suitable for err.	Ya dace da mai kuskure.
No one can leave.	Babu wanda zai iya barin.
I began to feel better.	Na fara jin dadi.
Maybe he was.	Wataƙila ya kasance.
She turned it on.	Ta kunna.
He heard a runner.	Ya ji mai gudu.
I'm just being honest about it.	Ni kawai gaskiya ne game da shi.
He is interested in them.	Yana sha'awar su.
Of course, this is not the only way.	Tabbas, ba wannan ba ita kaɗai ce hanya ba.
And so it is.	Kuma haka abin yake.
Even if they are given, they are from God.	Ko da an ba su, daga wurin Allah suke.
The rest was real, just as real.	Sauran ya kasance na gaske, kamar yadda yake da gaske.
Too much, too much.	Yayi yawa, yayi yawa.
However, this is a big world.	Duk da haka, wannan babban duniya ne.
I will meet you at the train station.	Zan hadu da ku a tashar jirgin kasa.
He must, or he may not work.	Dole ne ya yi, ko ba zai iya aiki ba.
They have no job to return to.	Ba su da aikin da za su koma.
The work will be a journey.	Aikin zai kasance tafiya.
And how did they do it?	Kuma yaya suka yi?
You can not log in and start doing this.	Ba za ku iya shiga ku fara yin wannan ba.
We may not think about it, but we do.	Wataƙila ba za mu yi tunani game da shi ba, amma muna yin hakan.
We were afraid to go out at night.	Mun ji tsoro mu fita da dare.
I do that sometimes.	Ina yin hakan wani lokaci.
I have to play.	Dole ne in yi wasa.
She had him arrested.	Ta sa aka kama shi.
Probably not though.	Wataƙila ba ko da yake.
They just happen.	Suna faruwa ne kawai.
Maybe she was sick when they got married.	Wataƙila ba ta da lafiya lokacin da suka yi aure.
I do them all the time.	Ina yin su koyaushe.
This helped him to concentrate.	Hakan ya taimaka masa ya mai da hankali sosai.
He had to look.	Sai da ya duba.
They are eating the wrong things.	Suna cin abubuwan da ba daidai ba.
But of course he would not.	Amma ba shakka ba zai yi haka ba.
This works best.	Wannan aiki mafi kyau.
For me, that surprised me.	A gare ni, wannan ya ba ni mamaki.
He is dead, and no one knows how it happened.	Ya mutu, kuma babu wanda ya san yadda abin ya faru.
They are sure.	Sun tabbata.
It can be viewed though.	Za a iya duba shi ko da yake.
I love this book	Ina son wannan littafin
I would never say 'maybe'.	Ba zan taɓa cewa 'wataƙila' ba.
Not often but sometimes.	Ba sau da yawa amma wani lokacin.
He was funny.	Ya kasance mai ban dariya.
There is no serious injury.	Babu wani mummunan rauni.
But she could not remember where he was.	Amma ta kasa tuna inda yake.
As he did when he was killed.	Kamar yadda ya yi a lokacin da aka kashe shi.
Now with the car.	Yanzu tare da mota.
They do not know where they live.	Ba su san inda suke zaune ba.
You are entirely on your own.	Kun kasance gaba ɗaya a kan ku.
It will definitely continue to be published.	Babu shakka za a ci gaba da buga shi.
It's too big.	Ya fi girma sosai.
Cannot recommend enough.	Ba za a iya ba da shawarar isa ba.
Which no doubt will do.	Wanda babu shakka zai yi.
I opened it and let it go.	Na bude na bar shi ya tafi.
We haven't talked about this in years.	Ba mu yi magana game da wannan ba cikin shekaru da yawa.
Including if it encounters an error.	Ciki har da idan ya ci karo da kuskure.
The wide door opens.	K'ofar ta fad'a yana bud'e ta.
I am very happy and excited.	Ina matukar farin ciki kuma ina jin dadi.
In fact, they already have.	A gaskiya ma, sun riga sun samu.
It was delicious.	Yayi dadi.
I need to stop talking.	Ina bukata in daina magana.
They came to me.	Sun zo min.
Hear if you can.	Ji idan za ku iya.
This is it.	Wannan shi ne.
But he was, he must be.	Amma ya kasance, dole ne ya kasance.
I am nothing.	Ni ba komai ba ne.
Fly to every planet in another.	Tashi zuwa kowace duniya a cikin wani.
I did a good job.	Na yi aiki mai kyau.
I am here.	Ina nan a can.
I am very scared of both.	Ina matukar jin tsoro ga duka.
It's just right.	Daidai ne kawai.
This shows me that he is definitely in trouble.	Wannan yana nuna mani cewa lallai yana cikin matsala.
Since the day she met him, it has been bigger than life.	Tun ranar da ta hadu da shi, ya fi rayuwa girma.
He left it there.	Ya bar shi a can.
However, this is not the case.	Duk da haka, wannan ba haka yake ba.
Of course, they were not.	Tabbas, ba su kasance ba.
They don't even know me.	Ba su ma san ni ba.
It works well.	Yana aiki mai kyau.
I like what to eat.	Ina son abin da zan ci.
He spoke to him several times.	Ya yi magana da shi sau da yawa.
The two of us.	Mu biyu.
It’s healthy and it’s delicious too.	Yana da lafiya kuma yana da daɗi kuma.
I do not know.	Ba zan sani ba.
Few see better.	Kadan suna ganin mafi kyau.
I do not even want to sleep.	Ba na ma son barci.
She is missing.	Ta bata.
They all need that.	Duk suna bukatar hakan.
Learn it for yourself and get a job.	Koyi shi da kanku kuma ku sami aiki.
The method works really well!	Hanyar tana aiki sosai da kyau!
I know what to say.	Na san abin da za ku ce.
And yet, you may wonder if there is anything else.	Kuma duk da haka, kuna iya mamakin ko akwai wani abu kuma.
All these things are not done.	Duk waɗannan abubuwan ba a yi su ba.
Or what makes success difficult to achieve.	Ko abin da ya sa nasara ya yi wahala a samu.
I told her a lot, though.	Na gaya mata da yawa, duk da haka.
I think for a moment.	Ina tunani na ɗan lokaci.
This makes it a reality for the rest of us.	Wannan ya sa ya zama gaskiya ga sauran mu.
Or not covered.	Ko ba a rufe ba.
And it works for me.	Kuma yana aiki a gare ni.
At that time now.	A wannan lokacin a yanzu.
He is married.	Ya yi aure.
What lives there is itself.	Abin da ke zaune a wurin shi ne kansa.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu wani abu da ya zama na gaske.
I know what she will do.	Na san abin da za ta yi.
He will find out soon.	Zai gano hakan da wuri.
Do not get up for what he is doing.	Kada ku tashi ga abin da yake yi.
I think there is a better way to work with people.	Ina ganin akwai hanya mafi kyau ta yin aiki da mutane.
I passed him.	Na wuce shi.
We all understand the rest.	Mu duka mun fahimci sauran.
We are.	Lallai mu ne.
But it is definitely time to move on.	Amma tabbas lokaci ya yi da za a ci gaba.
He showed me how.	Ya nuna min yadda.
I feel uncomfortable.	Ina jin ba dadi.
But then she recognized him.	Amma sai ta gane shi.
Lots and lots of travel.	Yawa da yawan tafiya.
It began to fill.	Ta fara cika.
I'm afraid what knowing others will do to me.	Ina tsoron abin da sanin sauran zai yi min.
You will put it all on me.	Za ku saka mini duka.
Be observant.	Kasance mai kula.
And if you go, the rest of us will stop.	Kuma idan kun tafi, sauran mu za mu tsaya.
We'd better get someone to look at this.	Gara mu tashi wani ya kalli wannan.
She might like that.	Tana iya son hakan.
That's all.	Wannan shi ne abin duka.
We ask for your help.	Muna neman taimakon ku.
It will not show to anyone.	Ba zai nuna wa kowa ba.
I want to pass.	Ina so in wuce.
Some things have changed here.	Wasu abubuwa sun canza a nan.
Everyone else did the same.	Duk sauran sun yi daidai.
If it really is easy, everyone is doing it.	Idan da gaske ne mai sauƙi, da kowa yana yin sa.
Do not walk.	Kada ku yi tafiya.
You can find them there.	Kuna iya samun su a can.
He wanted what he wanted.	Ya so abin da yake so.
Now we will take it seriously.	Yanzu za mu dauki shi a hankali.
None of this is relevant.	Babu wani daga cikin wannan da ya dace.
Just tell me to stop.	Kawai ka ce in daina.
As you can see.	Kamar yadda kuke gani .
I never understood this.	Ban taba gane wannan ba.
Life has changed a lot.	Rayuwa ta canza sosai.
He said that I would be employed there.	Ya ce a can za a yi min aiki.
It was like, there you go.	Ya kasance kamar, can ka tafi.
Let him see.	Bari ya gani.
At the end.	A karshen.
She realized there was no restaurant.	Ta gane babu wani wurin cin abinci.
You do what you are told.	Kuna yin abin da aka gaya muku.
No one will buy.	Ba wanda zai saya.
I kept this somewhere near the end.	Na ajiye wannan a wani wuri kusa da ƙarshe.
Now, she knows she will.	Yanzu, ta san za ta yi.
After a while, he stopped.	Bayan wani lokaci, ya tsaya.
They are not published as such.	Ba a buga su kamar haka ba.
You are delicious.	Kuna da dadi.
Excuse me.	Yi hakuri da ni.
It's nothing.	Ba komai bane.
It's in the door.	Yana cikin kofar.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
No wonder.	Babu abin mamaki.
We have it all in this car.	Muna da duka a cikin wannan motar.
It was a short time.	Ya kasance ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
There is only one, you can say.	Daya ne kawai, kana iya cewa.
I also want to go there.	Ni ma na so in je can.
And they prove very useful.	Kuma sun tabbatar da amfani sosai.
She did not want to give up.	Ba ta so ta bari.
Many people want to enjoy a cold drink.	Mutane da yawa suna son jin daɗin abin sha mai sanyi.
We do not have to think about it in the future.	Ba sai mun yi tunanin haka a gaba ba.
I got there.	Na isa can.
We see everything.	Muna ganin komai.
The doctor left.	Likitan ya tafi.
They did not move forward.	Ba su ci gaba ba.
I am in need.	Ina nan da bukata.
We explain this here.	Mun bayyana wannan a nan.
The problem may be as bad as it appears.	Matsalar na iya zama ba ta da kyau kamar yadda ta bayyana.
And this is true for many people.	Kuma hakan gaskiya ne ga mutane da yawa.
It helped a lot.	Ya taimaka sosai.
Take care of it.	Ka kula da shi.
That will change.	Wannan zai canza.
I was the right person at the time.	Ni ne na yi daidai lokacin.
It's a wonderful feeling.	Yana da ban mamaki ji.
Next we will explain how this can be done.	A cikin gaba za mu bayyana yadda za a iya yin hakan.
Only a few people came today.	Mutane kaɗan ne kawai suka zo yau.
She will come here.	Zata shiga nan.
That's why only the first one works.	Shi ya sa na farko kawai ke aiki.
I left him running for the night.	Na bar shi yana gudu don dare.
I get it again.	Ina samun shi kuma.
Focus on the positive.	Mai da hankali kan mai kyau.
It works, and it works well.	Yana aiki, kuma yana aiki da kyau.
The work is done.	An gama aikin.
She said she had no money.	Ta ce ba ta da kudi.
Otherwise he answers correctly.	Idan ba haka ba ya amsa daidai.
I never touched it, of course.	Ban taba shi ba, ba shakka.
What they should do next.	Abin da ya kamata su yi a gaba.
Let's see where he goes.	Bari mu ga inda ya kai.
I hope you enjoy it.	Ina fatan za ku ji daɗi.
He certainly didn't hear anything.	Lallai bai ji komai ba.
It's too small.	Kadan ne.
Not me.	Ba ni ba.
I can leave.	Zan iya barin.
But don't worry.	Amma kar ka damu.
But that did not happen.	Amma hakan bai faru ba.
I studied hard.	Na yi karatu sosai.
It would be nice.	Zai yi kyau.
I really enjoy the work.	Ina jin daɗin aikin sosai.
But you really don't need to die.	Amma da gaske babu bukatar ku mutu.
She stopped and hurried into the room.	Ta tsaya da sauri ya shiga dakin.
It does not.	Bata yi ba.
Well, you.	Da kyau, ku.
The dog eats the dog, so they say.	Kare yana cin kare, don haka suka ce.
Well, I enjoyed the feeling.	Da kyau, na ji daɗin ji.
New is doing things like that right now.	Sabon yana yin abubuwa kamar haka a yanzu.
I think it's really good.	Ina ganin yana da kyau sosai.
If you can’t, keep preparing your meal.	Idan ba za ku iya ba, ci gaba da shirya abincin ku.
I'm sure you will agree.	Na tabbata za ku yarda.
The right thing to do.	Abin da ya dace ya yi.
It is one life we ​​must take.	Rai daya ne dole mu dauka.
So the film will not only show past events.	Don haka fim ɗin ba zai nuna abubuwan da suka faru a baya ba kawai.
But this is happening.	Amma wannan yana faruwa.
Love me so much.	So ni sosai.
They are safe.	Lallai suna nan lafiya.
It's cold.	Yayi sanyi.
I'm very worried.	Na damu sosai.
That is something we should talk about.	Abin da ya kamata mu yi magana a kai ke nan.
They went out and kept going.	Suka fita suka yi ta faruwa.
He is back.	Ya dawo.
He just wants us to see and experience the best.	Yana so kawai mu gani kuma mu sami mafi kyau.
We want them to join us.	Muna son su shiga mu.
The weekend was a wonderful time.	Karshen mako ya kasance lokaci mai daɗi.
God was with her.	Allah ya kasance tare da ita.
Second, because it tasted so good.	Na biyu, saboda abin ya ji daɗi sosai.
They appear out of nowhere!	Sun bayyana daga babu!
However, it must work.	Duk da haka, dole ne ya yi aiki.
Nothing will stand in your way.	Babu wani abu da zai tsaya a kan hanyar ku.
You know it's time for a new person.	Kun san lokaci yayi da sabon mutum.
But he does not need to be.	Amma ba ya bukatar zama.
It makes everyone around him feel better.	Yana sa duk wanda ke kusa da shi ya fi kyau.
She is still feeling well.	Tana jin dadi har yanzu.
No, we cannot do that.	A'a, ba za mu iya yin hakan ba.
Marry only if you can find the right person.	Ka yi aure kawai idan ka sami mutumin da ya dace.
That was very difficult for me.	Hakan ya yi mini wuya sosai.
There was no help for him, however.	Babu wani taimako a gare shi, duk da haka.
She never made a mistake.	Ba ta taba yin kuskure ba.
She will do.	Za ta yi.
Now he realizes that it is somehow.	Yanzu ya gane cewa ta wata hanya ce.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
I showed her.	Na nuna mata.
Now it seems like it has never been.	Yanzu kamar ba a taba ba.
You will know when you are done.	Za ku san idan kun gama.
Not everything worked out, though.	Ba duk abin da ya yi aiki ba, ko da yake.
I do not remember the name of the restaurant.	Ban tuna sunan gidan abincin ba.
Looks like it's not enough.	Kamar bai isa ba.
More than once, though.	Fiye da sau ɗaya, ko da.
Nothing like that.	Ba abin da ya zama kamar.
A woman returns from school.	Wata mata ta dawo daga makaranta.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane.
They are known for that.	An san su da hakan.
I want my food to be simple most of the time.	Ina son abinci na ya kasance mai sauƙi mafi yawan lokaci.
It's nothing.	Ba komai ba ne.
We must make every effort though.	Dole ne mu yi kowane ƙoƙari ko da yake.
I’m not saying it’s easy, but it can be done.	Ba ina cewa yana da sauƙi ba, amma ana iya yin hakan.
Nothing will ever be written about him.	Ba za a taɓa rubuta wani abu game da shi ba.
I thought this might be a little off.	Na yi tunanin cewa wannan zai iya zama kadan.
You understand what works.	Kun gane menene aiki.
I did not get it.	ban samu ba.
Not on anything like that.	Ba a kan wani abu kamar wannan ba.
He was able to talk to me about that.	A kan haka ya iya magana da ni.
You look nice.	Kun yi kyau.
Good to see you tonight.	Yayi kyau ga daren yau.
Sometimes, life is good.	Wani lokaci, rayuwa tana da kyau.
This is a wonderful opportunity.	Wannan dama ce mai ban mamaki.
There is nothing she can do about it.	Ba abin da ta iya yi game da wannan.
No one spoke.	Babu wanda yayi magana.
Hard place.	Wuri mai wuya.
It can be clearly seen.	Ana iya gani sosai.
Let us not miss such an opportunity.	Kada mu rasa irin wannan damar.
He wanted to talk, and we talked.	Ya so ya yi magana, kuma magana muka yi.
Even if we don’t have it.	Ko da ba mu da shi.
And move on.	Kuma ci gaba.
It does not always work.	Ba koyaushe yana aiki ba.
But this place has to spend a lot of money.	Amma wannan wurin dole ne ya kashe wani kuɗi mai yawa.
But, then.	Amma, sai .
Be ahead.	Kasance a gaba.
But they are good.	Amma suna da kyau.
The method works today.	Hanyar tana aiki yau.
Their flight is late.	Jirgin su ya makara.
That is why we need you.	Shi ya sa muke bukatar ku.
It is still unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Har yanzu ba a san ko yaushe ba.
Will it be sold ?.	Za a sayar?.
And they want to go.	Kuma suna so su tafi.
That's good.	Hakan yayi kyau.
But, here we are.	Amma, ga mu nan.
The plane took off.	Jirgin ya tashi.
He understood, of course.	Ya gane, ba shakka.
That should be the case.	Haka ya kamata ya kasance.
I did something wrong.	Na yi wani abu ba daidai ba.
They don't know where to start.	Ba su san ta inda za su fara ba.
You talk a lot about working together.	Kuna magana da yawa game da aiki tare.
The time is right.	Lokacin ya dace.
He went outside.	Ya fita waje.
Users should know the following two things.	Ya kamata masu amfani su san abubuwa biyu masu zuwa.
It works fine.	Yana aiki lafiya.
There are needs.	Akwai masu bukata.
I did something.	Na yi wani abu.
We did two good things, we did.	Mun yi kyau biyu, mun yi.
Why should she worry? 	Me zai sa ta damu?
They drank a lot.	Sun sha da yawa.
But he must do what he can.	Amma dole ne ya yi abin da ya samu.
How much would not look like that.	Nawa ba zai yi kama da haka ba.
Change.	Canza.
Without them, there would be no fighting.	Ba tare da su ba, babu fada.
She wants to see him.	Tana son ya gani.
This allowed him to move faster.	Hakan ya bashi damar kara tafiya da sauri.
Focus on these.	Mai da hankali kan waɗannan.
She can't just leave it at that.	Ba za ta iya barin hakan kawai ba.
It just needs help.	Yana buƙatar taimako kawai.
She realized that it really was.	Ta gane cewa da gaske yake.
This is of course happening.	Wannan ba shakka yana faruwa.
In this heat we do not eat much.	A cikin wannan zafi ba ma cin abinci da yawa.
It became interesting with him.	Ya zama abin sha'awa tare da shi.
If she is eating now.	Idan tana cin abinci yanzu.
We'd better go.	Gara mu tafi.
Cold for everything except him.	Sanyi ga komai sai shi.
Express your grief.	Bayyana bakin cikin ku.
It was getting louder around this time.	An yi ƙara kusa da wannan lokacin.
They read a lot but very little.	Sun yi karatu da yawa amma kadan kadan.
If you do, you will have trouble.	Idan kun yi, za ku sami matsala.
Genuine.	Na gaske.
No one will come to help you.	Babu wani da zai zo ya taimake ku.
However this did not bother me.	Duk da haka wannan bai damu da ni ba.
We must go beyond it.	Dole ne mu wuce shi.
I'm feeling better.	Ina jin dadi.
I am not an athlete.	Ni ba dan wasa ba ne.
Leave it to me.	Ka bar min shi.
Make it whatever you want.	Sanya shi duk yadda kuke so.
He made me laugh.	Ya bani dariya.
We never found out where she came from.	Ba mu taba gano inda ta fito ba.
Life as we know it, we must die.	Rayuwa kamar yadda muka sani, dole ne mu mutu.
You want people to see.	Kuna son mutane su gani.
We said nothing.	Ba mu ce komai ba.
We do not need it now.	Ba mu bukata yanzu.
Many hands were raised including mine.	Hannu da yawa aka daga har da nawa.
No one got it.	Babu wanda ya samu.
He said nothing at first.	Bai ce komai ba da farko.
I don't have to say.	Bai kamata in ce ba.
He will not remember anything.	Ba zai tuna komai ba.
Many people.	Mutane da yawa.
This is not the case.	Wannan ba a da.
I hurried to run.	Na yi sauri na gudu.
I'll show you how.	Zan nuna muku yadda ake yi.
Of course he does for the moment.	Tabbas yana yi don lokacin.
This has never happened to me.	Wannan bai taba faruwa da ni ba.
If she dies he knows.	Idan ta mutu ya sani.
It's so delicious.	Tana da daɗi sosai.
You can stay with us tonight.	Kuna iya zama tare da mu a daren yau.
I go to work every day.	Ina zuwa aiki kowace rana.
Everything is done for her.	An gama mata komai.
Yet why nothing is too hard to say.	Amma duk da haka me ya sa babu wani abu da zai yi wuya a ce.
Very slowly.	A hankali da yawa.
But that has not happened yet.	Amma hakan bai faru ba tukuna.
Make sure you have the right equipment.	Tabbatar kana da kayan da suka dace.
I wrote the rest.	Na rubuta sauran.
And if they die, that's fine.	Kuma idan sun mutu, yana da kyau.
As he expected.	Kamar yadda ya zata.
I do not feel it is recommended that they are.	Ba na jin an ba da shawarar cewa su ne.
This may take some time.	Wannan na iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci.
It will be an easy boat to carry.	Za ta zama jirgin ruwa mai sauƙi don ɗauka.
He looked at his luggage.	Ya kalli kayan sa.
But today it can and must be stopped.	Amma a yau ana iya kuma dole a daina.
It is true though.	Gaskiya ne ko da yake.
You are still growing.	Kuna girma har yanzu.
I still haven't finished it.	Har yanzu ban gama da shi ba.
He let me hear.	Ya bari na ji.
So you can buy one.	Don haka kuna iya siyan ɗaya.
This is the last one.	Wannan shi ne na ƙarshe.
That's what he does.	Abin da yake yi ke nan.
So you know, keep it up.	Don haka ka sani, ci gaba da shi.
He didn’t care if it was real food or not.	Bai damu ba ko abincin gaske ne ko a'a.
Do what she says.	Yi abin da ta ce.
Something like that.	Wani abu kamar haka.
Why does he have to hurt every time he eats.	Me yasa ya zama dole ya ji rauni a duk lokacin da ya ci abinci.
He has to do a lot of things.	Kamata ya yi ya yi abubuwa da yawa.
Whatever you may think at first, this is a good thing.	Duk da abin da za ku iya tunani da farko, wannan abu ne mai kyau.
That too does not help.	Hakan ma baya taimaka.
The car was seized.	An kama motar.
I'm waiting for a call	Ina jiran kira
Not me, of course.	Ba ni ba, ba shakka.
This is a difficult task.	Wannan aiki mai wahala ne.
Not too much volume.	Babu ƙara da yawa sosai.
Is the water cold?	Ruwan yayi sanyi?
This is what we do for the project.	Wannan shi ne abin da muke yi don aikin.
Talk to me, like people.	Yi magana da ni, kamar mutane.
So they all were.	Haka duk suka kasance.
Please join the project, if you are interested.	Da fatan za a shiga aikin, idan kuna sha'awar.
I don't want to hear it again.	Ban so in ji shi kuma.
No no no.	A'a babu babu.
There is a back and forth.	Akwai baya da baya.
He may even have been scared to death.	Wataƙila ya ji tsoro har ya mutu.
No answer.	Bata amsa ba.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Babu kuskure game da shi.
They fear this may be the last.	Suna tsoron wannan yana iya zama na ƙarshe.
He may want to reuse it, put it somewhere.	Zai iya son sake amfani da shi, sanya shi wani wuri.
What if only.	Menene idan kawai.
They passed quickly.	Suka wuce da sauri.
It was a trip to save.	Tafiya ce ta ajiye.
The food was not eaten.	Ba a ci abincin ba.
We can't wait.	Ba za mu iya jira ba.
The timing must be right.	Dole ne lokacin ya kasance daidai.
It just doesn’t look good.	Kawai ba ya da kyau.
It’s a lot more than that.	Yana da yawa fiye da haka.
I felt like the world needed to hear.	Na ji kamar duniya na bukatar ji.
He knows them well.	Ya san su sosai.
You focus on what you do.	Kuna mai da hankali kan abin da kuke yi.
You have to do it, whatever.	Dole ne ku yi shi, komai.
He could not decide what to plan.	Ba zai iya yanke shawarar abin da zai shirya ba.
They’re not weird anymore though.	Ba su zama abin ban mamaki ba kuma ko da yake.
I'm excited to have the opportunity to come and help.	Ina farin cikin samun damar zuwa in taimaka.
That did not stop.	Hakan bai tsaya ba.
I'm tired of doing the work.	Na gaji da yin aikin.
I allow you to do that.	Ina ba ku damar yin hakan.
And after that we didn’t enjoy anything.	Kuma bayan haka ba mu ji daɗin komai ba.
He goes in there.	Yana shiga can.
He knows what he is doing.	Ya san abin da yake yi.
They go out, hear.	Suna fita, ji.
You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.	Ba ku da abin da za ku rasa kuma duk abin da za ku samu.
I will tell him we will get married.	Zan ce masa za mu yi aure.
We have a place for you.	Muna da wurin jiran ku.
It will be found, man.	Za a samu ta, mutum.
He did not wait any longer.	Bai kara jira ba.
You have a big task cut out for you.	Kuna da babban aiki da aka yanke muku.
More and more.	Ana ci gaba da ƙara ƙarin.
We want to be sure.	Muna so mu tabbata.
Come back and look.	Ku zo a baya ku duba.
You do not have to accept anything.	Ba sai ka yarda da komai ba.
I know this, you know this.	Na san wannan, kun san wannan.
It has many benefits.	Yana da amfani da yawa.
You will do it with these.	Za ku yi shi da waɗannan.
And now me.	Kuma yanzu ni.
He!' 	Shi!'
Maybe someone died.	Wataƙila wani ya mutu.
He said.	Yace.
Police boarded the plane and arrested the man.	'Yan sanda sun shiga jirgin suka kama mutumin.
I had to find a house to live in.	Dole na sami wani gidan da zan zauna.
What have we been doing?	Me muka kasance muna yi?
Maybe she did.	Wataƙila ta yi.
But after he had been with many, he stayed one day.	Amma bayan yana tare da mutane da yawa, yanzu ya zauna ɗaya.
This is doing the job.	Wannan yana yin aikin.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Kallon su yayi ba dadi.
He wants you to tell him everything about him.	Yana so ka gaya masa komai game da shi.
She did not try to live with anyone.	Ba ta yi ƙoƙarin zama da wani mutum ba.
He wrote it was something.	Ya rubuta yana da wani abu.
However, there are some things in play here.	Duk da haka, akwai wasu abubuwa a wasa a nan.
I will be too.	Ni ma zan kasance.
I am no better than anyone else.	Ni ban fi kowa ba.
She also loved him at the time.	Ita ma ta so shi a lokacin.
This cannot be ignored.	Ba za a iya barin wannan ba.
I told him it was a joke.	Na ce masa wasa ne.
It could be me this time.	Zai iya zama ni wannan lokacin.
I don't want her to suffer.	Ba na son ta sha wahala.
Making them go is enough.	Yin su tafi ya isa.
We got that.	Mun samu haka.
No, it is enough!	A'a, ya isa!
This is the main thing.	Wannan shi ne babban abu.
Not comfortable.	Ba dadi.
To get there was a boat ride and it was very comfortable.	Don isa wurin ya kasance ta jirgin ruwa kuma yana jin daɗi sosai.
I am telling you what happened to me one day.	Ina gaya muku abin da ya faru da ni wata rana.
Some you will like.	Wasu za ku so.
There are very few who die.	Akwai 'yan kaɗan da suka mutu.
All things were.	Duk abubuwan da suka kasance.
One day early.	Wata rana da wuri.
That has been two years now.	Hakan ya wuce shekara biyu yanzu.
She had to stop several times.	Sai da ta tsaya sau da yawa.
So if you say you are talking about something that is not right.	Don haka idan ka ce kai kana magana da abin da bai dace ba.
She does too.	Ita ma haka.
He proved it.	Ya tabbatar da hakan.
Everything seems to be here.	Komai yanzu kamar yana nan.
Dinner only.	Abincin dare ne kawai.
It can be seen as follows.	Ana iya gani kamar haka.
I am happy about that.	Na yi farin ciki da hakan.
They hope he goes.	Suna fatan ya tafi.
A new man.	Wani sabon mutum.
The girls are scared.	'Yan mata suna tsoro.
She is also scared.	Ita ma tsoro ce.
They did not drink.	Ba su sha ba.
She can sleep in the morning if she wants to.	Zata iya kwana da safe idan ta so.
That she could not understand.	Cewa ta kasa gane.
I realized that he was an amazing person.	Na gane cewa shi mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
It’s hard to write a little and well.	Yana da wuya a rubuta kadan kuma da kyau.
I think you can help me, you can even get it.	Ina tsammanin za ku iya taimaka mini, har ma za ku iya samun shi.
But that doesn't work either.	Amma hakan ma baya aiki.
If so, someone will eventually find out.	Idan haka ne, wani zai gano a ƙarshe.
It was never said that.	Ba a taba cewa ba.
It seemed like a scary place.	Ya zama kamar wuri ne mai ban tsoro.
I like them a lot.	Ina son su da yawa.
I don't even know you.	Ban ma san ku ba.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu kamar ba a gano shi ba.
We had to wait for the bus.	Sai da muka jira bas.
This can be changed by the user.	Ana iya canza wannan ta mai amfani.
The grocer laughed.	Mai kayan abinci ya yi dariya.
I see now.	Ina gani yanzu.
But it does not work that way.	Amma ba ya aiki haka.
Then he realized.	Sai ya gane.
It is a working problem.	Matsala ce ta aiki.
It's just money.	Kudi ne kawai.
We should not leave it to anyone.	Kada mu bar wa wani.
Don't tell her.	Kar ka gaya mata.
You made another drink.	Kun yi abin sha kuma.
I need you to buy.	Ina bukata ku saya.
I'm on it completely.	Ina kan shi gaba daya.
A new attempt.	Wani sabon ƙoƙari.
Give them something to buy.	Ka ba su abin da za su sayi waɗannan abubuwan.
This requires more effort.	Wannan yana buƙatar ƙarin ƙoƙari.
Here, one should not try to think, one must hear.	A nan, kada mutum ya yi ƙoƙari ya yi tunani, dole ne ya ji.
You must make every effort to do this.	Dole ne ku yi kowane ƙoƙari don yin wannan.
Just no.	Kawai babu.
He saw a lot of fighting.	Ya ga fada da yawa.
She wanted it then.	Ta so shi a lokacin.
No one will be allowed after that.	Ba za a yarda da kowa ba bayan haka.
The request must be answered.	Dole ne a amsa bukatar.
A feeling came to me slowly over time.	Wani ji ne ya zo min a hankali cikin lokaci.
First, there is no money.	Da farko, babu kudi.
I never caught him with a lie.	Ban taba kama shi da wata karya ba.
However, finding the location is not an easy task.	Duk da haka, gano wurin ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
This place cannot be missed.	Ba za a iya rasa wannan wurin ba.
Do not be selfish.	Kada ku zama masu son kai.
You can see what is happening.	Kuna iya ganin abin da ke faruwa.
We have to keep going.	Dole ne mu ci gaba.
He revealed himself to only those closest to him.	Ya bayyana kansa ga na kusa da shi kawai.
So we just stopped.	Sai muka tsaya kawai.
Without me, of course.	Ba tare da ni ba, ba shakka.
It is still true.	Har yanzu gaskiya ne.
I know where he went.	Na san inda ya tafi.
If you are once, you will come back.	Idan kun kasance sau ɗaya, za ku dawo.
He is a very intelligent man.	Mutum ne mai hankali da gaske.
I will never let anything bad happen again.	Ba zan taɓa barin wani mummunan abu ya sake faruwa ba.
So just to make it work.	Don haka kawai in sa shi yayi aiki.
This should not work.	Bai kamata wannan ya yi aiki ba.
I know it's true.	Na san cewa gaskiya ne.
This is a big deal around here.	Wannan babban abu ne a kusa da nan.
Here is the truth.	Ga gaskiya.
Do not fly again like this.	Kar ku sake tashi kamar haka.
He is tired of her.	Ya gaji da ita.
I could not get up.	Na kasa tashi.
She was injured.	An ji mata rauni.
It worked amazingly well.	Ya yi aiki da ban mamaki da kyau.
Something like that.	Wani abu kamar haka.
He was very happy and right.	Ya yi farin ciki sosai kuma daidai.
No one wanted to talk to me anymore.	Babu wanda ya so ya yi magana da ni kuma.
They did.	Haka suka yi.
Not less here, how.	Ba kasa a nan ba, ta yaya.
But he did nothing.	Amma bai yi komai ba.
He will always be with us.	Zai kasance tare da mu koyaushe.
Every car has one like that.	Kowace mota tana da irin wannan.
She used to see two people at the same time.	Ta kasance tana ganin mutane biyu lokaci guda.
I remember it all now.	Na tuna duka yanzu.
We will take whatever you can get.	Za mu dauki duk abin da za ku iya samu.
We failed.	Mu kasa ce.
He has written extensively.	Ya rubuta da yawa.
Probably not.	Wataƙila hakan ba haka yake ba.
Almost exactly the same thing.	Kusan daidai yake da ainihin abu.
This is the best time of the year.	Wannan shine lokacin mafi kyau na shekara.
They are huge.	Suna da girma.
It is incomplete.	Bai cika ba.
I really appreciate your work.	Ina matukar sha'awar aikin ku.
I did not say when.	Ban ce yaushe ba.
He knows where he is.	Ya san inda yake.
I'll show you.	Zan nuna maka.
I heard the story.	Na ji labarin.
You have that kind of heat.	Kuna da irin wannan zafi.
We are fighting it.	Muna fada da ita.
You guys are joking.	Ku mutane abin wasa ne.
It's a good game.	Wasa ce mai kyau da shi.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
But it is hard to find.	Amma yana da wuya a samu.
These are mine.	Waɗannan nawa ne.
You can use it.	Kuna iya amfani da shi.
I tried but could not find the answer.	Na gwada amma ban samu amsa ba.
Go ahead, hear it.	Ci gaba, ji shi.
This will be on.	Wannan zai zama a.
Easy to use.	Sauƙi don amfani.
We see what we find along the way.	Muna ganin abin da muka samu a hanya.
It seems like it should look like that.	Ya zama kamar ya kamata a yi kama da haka.
I was surprised by the rest.	Na yi mamakin sauran.
And it will always be.	Kuma zai kasance koyaushe.
Take my money.	Dauki kuɗi na.
But we will find a way.	Amma za mu sami hanya.
We hope he is right.	Muna fatan ya yi gaskiya.
I was tired of everything over the weekend.	Na gaji da komai a karshen mako.
We need to see things as they will be.	Muna buƙatar ganin abubuwa kamar yadda za su kasance.
First, they have not done anything yet.	Na farko, ba su yi komai ba tukuna.
It covers that successfully.	Yana rufe hakan cikin nasara.
Now more than ever.	Yanzu fiye da kowane lokaci.
Life on a boat can be lonely.	Rayuwa a kan jirgin ruwa na iya zama kaɗai.
Use it all at once.	Yi amfani da shi lokaci guda.
It must be in the morning.	Dole ne ya kasance da safe.
They forgot to take some money.	Sun manta sun dauki wasu kudi.
Not very interesting.	Ba abu mai ban sha'awa sosai ba.
He lost once.	Ya bata sau daya.
Whatever she does.	Duk abin da take yi.
It feels like rain.	Yana jin kamar ruwan sama.
We must leave now if we are to catch this flight.	Dole ne mu bar yanzu idan za mu kama wannan jirgin.
I never went home.	Lallai ban taba zuwa gida ba.
I checked it out one day.	Na duba shi wata rana.
It should be heard.	Ya kamata a ji shi.
Sometimes if you don't think he can, he does.	Wani lokacin kuma idan ba ka tunanin zai iya, sai ya yi.
We give them everything they want.	Muna ba su duk abin da suke so.
Mistakes are being made.	Ana yin kuskure.
I'm not sure she can take it.	Ban tabbata zata iya dauka ba.
He made an unusual request.	Ya yi wata bukata da ba a saba gani ba.
Another thing.	Wani abu kuma.
They see and say nothing.	Suka gani ba su ce komai ba.
I tell you what to do.	Ina gaya muku abin da za mu yi.
This is an interesting thing to think about.	Wannan abu ne mai ban sha'awa don yin tunani.
Only a child.	Yaro ne kawai.
So you can join.	Haka za ku iya shiga.
Walk in that direction and if so.	Tafiya a cikin wannan hanya kuma kuma idan haka ne.
But it doesn’t work for everyone.	Amma ba ya aiki ga kowa.
This desire makes us work.	Wannan sha'awar ta sa mu yi aiki.
So she prepared the story that she was pregnant.	Don haka ta shirya labarin cewa tana da ciki.
Stop going out.	A daina fita.
I think this is probably them.	Ina tsammanin wannan watakila su ne.
I'm still in trouble.	Har yanzu ina cikin matsalar.
I made this house for you.	Na yi muku wannan gida.
We took care of all this.	Mun kula da duk wannan.
So let it pass.	Don haka bari ya wuce.
She was really happy to hear from me.	A gaskiya ta yi farin ciki da jin daga gare ni.
Looking for me	Neman ni
He took care of me.	Ya kula da ni.
I found a seat.	Na sami wurin zama.
And try it.	Kuma gwada ya yi.
We just.	Mu kawai.
God next, second person.	Allah na gaba, mutum na biyu.
It's just funny.	Abin ban dariya ne kawai.
And we went.	Kuma mun tafi.
I understand where you come from.	Na fahimci inda kuka fito.
Just be funny.	Kawai zama mai ban dariya.
But no one said anything.	Amma babu wanda ya ce komai.
The book is well written.	An rubuta littafin da kyau.
The game was the thing.	Wasan ya kasance abin.
It works well for them.	Yana aiki da kyau a gare su.
I feel so good.	Na ji dadi sosai.
I like the way it was.	Ina son yadda abin ya kasance.
This is the time.	Wannan lokacin ne.
Let's go see.	Mu je mu gani.
I do not know where to print it.	Ban san inda zan buga shi ba.
Do not let the water run.	Kar a bar ruwan yana gudu.
He really helped me.	Ya taimake ni sosai .
No food, no water, no sleep.	Ba abinci, ba ruwa, ba barci.
I was kind of a big deal.	Na kasance irin babban abu.
They need to make that statement.	Suna bukatar yin wannan magana.
I do not have to.	Ba sai na yi ba.
I made some money.	Na sami kuɗi kaɗan.
I was tired that day.	Na gaji a ranar.
I beg to differ.	Ban yarda ba.
Two-thirds.	Biyu cikin uku.
All on the plane!	Duk a cikin jirgin sama!
You were with him every day for a week.	Kun kasance tare da shi kowace rana har tsawon mako guda.
This is about consent.	Wannan game da yarda ne.
I already have	Ina da riga
They all refused.	Duk sun ƙi.
They really need them, after all.	Suna buƙatar su da gaske, bayan haka.
She is afraid he will cut himself.	Tana tsoron kar ya yanke kansa.
He knew me from the beginning.	Ya san ni tun farko.
We're done here.	Mun gama a nan.
No one can be sure.	Babu wanda zai iya tabbata.
I feel often enough, on my own and in other women.	Na ji sau da yawa isa, a kaina da kuma a cikin sauran mata.
We re-entered without knowing when we were going to leave.	Mun sake shiga ba tare da sanin lokacin da za mu fita ba.
She is amazing.	Ta ban mamaki.
Nothing here.	Babu komai a nan.
We know each other.	Mun san juna.
There is another way to see it.	Akwai wata hanyar ganin ta.
And there are many things he wants to say.	Kuma akwai abubuwa da yawa da yake so ya ce.
We took a lot.	Mun dauka da yawa.
Think about what can be done with that money.	Ka yi tunanin abin da za a iya yi da wannan kuɗin.
Now that you have come here.	Yanzu da kun zo nan.
When it rained, it was hard to hear.	Lokacin da aka yi ruwan sama, yana da wuya a ji.
That's what you did.	Abin da kuka yi ke nan.
I always have.	Kullum ina da.
I'm sick to get up early!	Ba ni da lafiya na tashi da wuri!
Of course, we too will not learn anything from it.	Tabbas, mu ma ba za mu koyi komai daga ciki ba.
I really enjoy this book.	Ina jin daɗin wannan littafin.
I understand what they want.	Na fahimci abin da suke so.
Which suits me.	Wanda ya dace da ni.
Fish is a delicious food.	Kifi abinci ne mai daɗi.
Such things seem hard to come by again.	Irin waɗannan abubuwa kamar da wuya su zo daga kuma.
I joined her.	Na shiga da ita.
It makes you a new person.	Yana sanya ku sabon mutum.
Everyone has a role to play.	Kowa yana da aikin sa.
That's what you do.	Wannan kuke yi.
See what's going on.	Duba abin da ke faruwa.
I think she does everything.	Ina tsammanin tana yin komai.
Everyone knows me there.	Kowa ya san ni a can.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
I understand this answer completely.	Na fahimci wannan amsa gaba ɗaya.
I will not worry.	Ba zan damu ba.
Whatever it was.	Duk ya kasance.
You agree with that.	Kun yarda da hakan.
She prepares food.	Ta shirya abinci.
Instantly like no money.	Nan take kamar babu kudi.
I was happy afterwards.	Na ji daɗi bayan haka.
It was like.	Ya zama kamar .
I put it on and it was a great help.	Na saka shi kuma ya kasance babban taimako.
They say they are lost.	Suka ce sun bata.
But if we do not pay it.	Amma idan ba mu biya shi ba.
He got what he wanted.	Ya samu abin da yake so.
He continued to walk for a long time.	Ya ci gaba da tafiya har tsawon lokaci.
People love her very much.	Mutane suna son ta sosai.
So the three of us agreed to do it.	Don haka mu uku muka yarda za mu yi.
It really is.	Da gaske yake.
I would have recognized it by myself.	Da na gane shi da kaina.
He came and went.	Ya zo ya tafi.
He did it because he knew he could do it.	Ya yi shi ne saboda ya san zai iya yin hakan.
No more.	Ba kuma.
Of course he did.	Tabbas ya ji.
The call for volunteers goes out.	Kira ga masu sa kai ya fita.
But eventually you come to see where it is for the better.	Amma a ƙarshe kun zo don ganin inda yake don mafi kyau.
She seemed to reach for something.	Ta yi kamar ta kai wani abu.
You do not care.	Bata kula ba.
It shows me my place.	Tana nuna min wuri na.
In fact, you can do it now.	A gaskiya ma, za ku iya yin shi a yanzu.
I did nothing.	Ban yi wani abu ba.
You need to take care of yourself.	Kuna buƙatar kula da kanku.
They had a great time.	Sun yi lokaci mai kyau.
You can even just walk.	Kuna iya ma tafiya kawai.
And then we start to doubt a little.	Kuma sai mu fara shakka kadan.
I like playing soft.	Ina son ana wasa a hankali.
We lived in peace.	Muka zauna lafiya.
I remember it, though.	Na tuna shi, duk da haka.
Three in the morning.	Uku na safe.
Just sad.	Bakin ciki kawai.
And we need that.	Kuma muna bukatar hakan.
Sure, the first day he got up.	Tabbas, ranar farko da ya tashi.
And so on.	A cikin haka kuma.
However, she did not feel comfortable.	Duk da haka, ba ta ji dadi ba.
She fought and failed.	Ta yi fada da rashin nasara.
I never gave him a chance.	Ban taba ba shi dama ba.
They hate it when you have a problem.	Sun ƙi shi idan kun sami matsala.
Everyone got married that way.	Kowa yayi aure haka.
It is difficult to take.	Yana da wuya a ɗauka.
We do not have many people there.	Ba mu da mutane da yawa a wurin.
I know it will never make him turn on either.	Na san ba zai taba sa shi kunna ko daya ba.
If you have seen this article you can read about it.	Idan kun ga wannan labarin za ku iya karanta game da shi.
They are just two.	Su biyu ne kawai.
Maybe he will.	Wataƙila zai yi.
Their plan did not work.	Shirin su bai yi aiki ba.
I was walking, myself on the floor.	Ina ta tafiya, kaina a kasa.
Good reading.	Kyakkyawan karatu.
Maybe not for them.	Wataƙila ba a gare su ba .
I do not want to know if he can do that.	Ban so in sani ko zai iya yin hakan.
No one told me how to do it.	Babu wanda ya gaya mani yadda zan yi.
People have to start thinking about that.	Dole ne mutane su fara tunanin hakan.
Water should be printed anytime now.	Ya kamata a buga ruwa kowane lokaci yanzu.
She opened the door.	Ta bude kofar.
I hope you like.	Ina fata kuna so.
We have two years left.	Muna da sauran shekaru biyu.
It’s kind of open to me.	Yana da irin bude a gare ni.
Anyone who knows anything knows that.	Duk wanda ya san wani abu ya san haka.
You know it when you hear it.	Kuna san shi lokacin da kuka ji shi.
You know you have the sun.	Kun san kuna da rana.
Obviously this is not true yet.	Babu shakka wannan bai zama gaskiya ba tukuna.
See, do not speak.	Duba, kada ku yi magana.
He waited his turn.	Ya jira lokacin sa.
It does not feel good.	Ba ji dadi ba ne.
She has been doing it for us since she was a child.	Ta kasance tana yi mana ita tun tana yara.
He closed the book.	Ya rufe littafin.
That never happened.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
You will surely remember.	Za ku tabbata ku tuna.
We have not been able to prove it.	Ba mu sami damar tabbatar da hakan ba.
It must have been.	Lallai ya kasance.
You know this is wrong.	Kun san wannan ba daidai ba ne.
We must leave immediately.	Dole ne mu tafi nan da nan.
Trying is enough.	Yin ƙoƙarin ya isa.
She must have known.	Lallai ta sani.
He is not a thinker.	Shi ba mai tunani bane.
This is correct.	Wannan daidai ne.
But it must be a good and easy job for them.	Amma dole ne ya zama aiki mai kyau da sauƙi a gare su.
But it’s hard to change what you can’t see.	Amma yana da wuya a canza abin da ba za ku iya gani ba.
However, it must be done.	Duk da haka, dole ne a yi.
But few know.	Amma tabbas kaɗan ne suka sani.
It was even better close.	Ya ma fi kyau kusa.
Do not let anyone take it.	Kar ka bari kowa ya dauka.
You must return.	Dole ne ku dawo.
Who is not here or there.	Wanda ba a nan ko can ba.
Who put it there?	Wanene ya sanya shi a can?
That changed me a lot.	Hakan ya canza mini abubuwa sosai.
You will know better than I do.	Za ku fi ni sani.
I made some adjustments to finish the job.	Na yi wasu gyara na gama aikin.
You all stopped.	Duk kun daina.
I told myself nothing.	Na fada wa kaina ba komai.
They believe that lying is the truth.	Sun yarda cewa karya ita ce gaskiya.
It's hard to fight.	Yana da wuya a yi fada.
There is no progress.	Babu wani ci gaba.
We must also take tools.	Dole ne kuma mu ɗauki kayan aiki.
Which is.	Wanda shine.
This is great.	Wannan yayi kyau.
Tell me you will try to be as you are.	Faɗa min za ku yi ƙoƙarin zama kamar yadda kuka kasance.
She is a foodie.	Mai cin abinci ce.
Turn off and run, now.	Kashe ka gudu, yanzu.
I wonder what he is thinking.	Ina mamakin me yake tunani.
So, do you want to go out with me sometime?	Don haka, kuna so ku fita tare da ni wani lokaci?
But they do not really like it.	Amma da gaske ba sa son hakan.
It can take.	Zai iya ɗauka.
Obviously you need to do more.	Babu shakka kuna buƙatar yin ƙarin.
You are scared.	Kun ji tsoro.
If they come they will kill me.	Idan sun zo za su kashe ni.
I live upstairs.	Ina zaune sama.
I didn’t ask how long she had or what she wanted.	Ban tambayi tsawon lokacin da ta yi ba ko me take so.
I have no difficulty at school.	Ba ni da wahala a makaranta.
Come here.	Ku zo nan.
Some of it.	Wasu daga ciki.
What she has is.	Abin da ta ke da shi ne.
What a surprise you get.	Abin ban mamaki da kuke samu.
Suddenly he felt uncomfortable.	Nan take ya ji babu dadi.
How many of these things?	Nawa ne daga cikin waɗannan abubuwa?
And someone will come to fix it.	Kuma wani zai zo gyara.
I kept walking.	Na ci gaba da tafiya.
The work you are doing there is good.	Aikin da kuke yi a wurin ya yi kyau.
Everyone needs to play well.	Kowane mutum yana buƙatar wasa da kyau.
There is no living thing.	Babu wani abu mai rai.
If there is anything to be found, the police have found it.	Idan akwai abin da za a gano, da 'yan sanda sun gano shi.
He went home.	Ya tafi gida.
He is just a happy person.	Mutum ne mai farin ciki kawai.
It is common to hear that.	Ya zama ruwan dare don jin haka.
This should be done before.	Ya kamata a yi wannan kafin.
Hurry up, it's time to go!	Yi sauri, lokaci ya yi da za a tafi!
I know it still works to take everything in.	Na san har yanzu yana aiki don ɗaukar komai a ciki.
I don't like it very much.	Ban so shi sosai.
He didn’t expect to get much.	Bai yi tsammanin samun yawa ba.
She made the day even more exciting.	Ta sanya ranar ta fi ban sha'awa.
She walked fast.	Ta yi tafiya da sauri.
She was a lot of fun.	Ta kasance mai yawan jin daɗi.
Hopefully it will help others.	Da fatan zai taimaka wa wasu.
She is still unemployed and still has no money.	Har yanzu ba ta da aiki kuma har yanzu ba su da kuɗi.
I don't think they will care.	Ba na tsammanin za su damu.
Which is very good for me.	Wanda yayi min kyau sosai.
We made them.	Muka sanya su.
We must take care.	Dole ne mu kula.
Do this from start to finish.	Yi wannan daga farko zuwa ƙarshe.
It's one of the best right now.	Yana daya mafi kyau a yanzu.
So they have not yet been tested.	Don haka har yanzu ba a gwada su ba.
But he does not want to go out on his own.	Amma baya son fita da kan sa.
He is not well.	Ba ya nan da kyau.
He doesn't need to do anything else.	Ba ya buƙatar yin wani abu kuma.
He thought he could get out of it.	Ya yi tunanin zai iya fita da hakan.
Which makes me very happy now.	Abin da ke sa ni farin ciki sosai a yanzu.
No back calls.	Babu kira baya.
No, she was not.	A'a, ba ta kasance ba.
Not because you think you can walk on my own.	Ba don kuna tunanin za ku iya tafiya a kaina ba.
But, overall we did a good job.	Amma, gaba ɗaya mun yi aiki mai kyau.
Hand delivered.	An ba da hannu.
Maybe years have got the best of her.	Wataƙila shekaru sun sami mafi kyawun ta.
however.	duk da haka.
Read it for fun.	Karanta shi don jin daɗi.
She gives him food.	Ta ba shi abinci.
Not for them, on his own.	Ba a gare su ba, a kansa.
Must see if anything has changed.	Dole ne a gani idan wani abu ya canza.
Let stand until cool.	Bari tsaya har sai sanyi.
You have to keep fighting.	Dole ku ci gaba da fada.
They are really weak.	Suna da rauni da gaske.
It is raining and she is leaving the house.	Ana ruwa ta bar gidan.
Great heat.	Babban bakin zafi.
They can no longer make mistakes.	Ba za su iya ƙara yin kuskure ba.
She is what she sees.	Ita ce abin da take gani.
I saw it in the movie.	Na ga haka a cikin fim.
The problem is what happens next.	Matsalar ita ce abin da ke faruwa bayan haka.
With children.	Da yara.
Every year, the rain appears in the background.	Kowace shekara, ruwan sama yana bayyana a baya.
You know there is still a problem.	Ka san har yanzu akwai wata matsala.
Just buy the book.	Kawai saya littafin.
He almost killed everything.	Ya kusan kashe komai.
One moment is there.	Lokaci daya yana can.
This is very difficult for me.	Wannan yana da wuya a gare ni.
That can't be found.	Ba za a iya samun hakan ba.
I travel, a lot.	Ina tafiya, da yawa.
Very, very good.	Sosai, da kyau sosai.
But she won't.	Amma ba za ta yi ba.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
Remember, you only have so much time.	Ka tuna, kuna da lokaci mai yawa kawai.
Then I told her.	Sai na gaya mata.
This is a happy day.	Wannan rana ce ta farin ciki.
And now this.	Kuma yanzu wannan.
She got out of the car.	Ita kuma ta fito daga motar.
It feels like there is no time.	Ji yayi kamar babu lokaci.
All of these, but more than that.	Duk waɗannan, amma fiye da haka.
People think they will say.	Mutane suna tsammanin za su ce.
In fact, he was hoping for that.	A gaskiya ma, ya kasance yana fatan hakan.
Be healthy and healthy.	Kasance lafiya da lafiya.
You can not do it at home.	Ba za ku iya yin shi a gida ba.
We are here to kill you.	Mun zo nan don kashe ku.
Maybe things are better now.	Wataƙila abubuwa sun yi kyau yanzu.
I am going home.	Zan je na gida.
I started writing the book.	Na fara rubuta littafin.
I feel it will not be done on time.	Ina jin ba za a yi shi akan lokaci ba.
I wanted her to fight.	Na so ta yi fada.
It's too late.	Ya makara.
She didn't want them to see how she felt.	Ba ta son su ga yadda take ji.
I was terrified all the time when she was alone.	Na kasance cikin tsoro duk lokacin da ita kaɗai ce.
And it turns out they love it.	Kuma ya zama suna son shi.
How is she?	Tana da yaya.
He expected that.	Ya yi tsammanin hakan.
It is a real mistake.	Kuskure ne na gaskiya.
Can you bring it here?	Za a iya kawo shi nan?
I can keep going.	Zan iya ci gaba da ci gaba.
Happiness cannot be bought with money,	Ba a iya siyan farin ciki da kuɗi,
Everyone agrees on that.	Kowa ya yarda akan haka.
That's when we decided to get help.	A lokacin ne muka yanke shawarar samun taimako.
No need, get out of here.	Babu bukata, fita nan.
And there are not many who can open it.	Kuma babu da yawa da za su iya bude shi.
However, she has such an active mind.	Duk da haka, tana da irin wannan tunani mai aiki.
But we know when you go, you will come back.	Amma mun san lokacin da kuka tafi, za ku dawo.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
He did not tell anyone.	Bai gaya wa kowa komai ba.
Growth requires money.	Girma yana buƙatar kuɗi.
Unable to find a place to fix it.	Ya kasa gano inda zai fara gyara shi.
I had never heard the rest of the story.	Bata taba jin sauran labarin ba.
People need to know what happened.	Mutane suna bukatar sanin abin da ya faru.
I do not know exactly why.	Ban san ainihin dalilin da ya sa ba.
We are on the verge of everything.	Muna kan bakin komai.
He won't go into the room, of course.	Ba zai shiga dakin ba, tabbas.
I think she continued that way.	Ina tsammanin ta ci gaba ta wannan hanyar.
But it made me feel good.	Amma ya sa na ji daɗi.
We tried it however.	Mun gwada shi duk da haka.
But of course, she will not be there.	Amma ba shakka, ba za ta kasance a wurin ba.
No one passed.	Babu wanda ya wuce.
They bring happiness to everyone.	Suna kawo farin ciki ga kowa.
She knew what he was thinking.	Ta san abin da yake tunani.
They walk slowly.	Tafiya suke a hankali.
The fastest way.	Hanya mafi sauri.
And so far, no one can.	Kuma ya zuwa yanzu, babu wanda zai iya.
We met, though, and it was good.	Mun hadu, ko da yake, kuma yana da kyau.
But look at what will happen in the next few years.	Amma kalli abin da zai faru a cikin ƴan shekaru masu zuwa.
I never thought of that.	Ban taba tunanin hakan ba.
Who sat there.	Wanene ya zauna a can.
However, if they do, nothing happens.	Duk da haka, idan sun yi, babu abin da ke faruwa.
We came here to see who we met.	Mun zo nan mu ga wanda muka hadu.
It is not as easy as you think.	Ba shi da sauƙi kamar yadda kuke tunani.
But today, they will be.	Amma a yau, za su kasance.
All of these do not work for me.	Duk waɗannan ba sa aiki a gare ni.
She didn't think it was enough.	Bata yi tunanin ya isa ba.
He can't wait.	Da alama ba zai iya jira ba.
Do not be afraid.	Kar ku ji tsoro.
We love them too.	Mu ma muna son su.
We know it's the real thing.	Mun san shi ne ainihin abin.
This went on for years.	Hakan ya ci gaba har tsawon shekaru.
You are useful.	Kai mai amfani ne.
So, happy for him and everyone there.	Don haka, farin ciki a gare shi da duk wanda ke wurin.
I don't want to use it.	Ba na son amfani da shi.
No police, no one.	Babu 'yan sanda, babu kowa.
If so.	Idan haka kuke so.
She did not live.	Ba ta zaune ba.
Also, lying is not very good.	Haka kuma, karya ba ta da kyau sosai.
I have an easy job.	Ni ne ke da aiki mai sauƙi.
No one can be seen.	Babu wani mutum da za a gani.
That is not fair.	Hakan bai dace ba.
And the game is what it is.	Kuma wasan shi ne abin da yake.
I enjoyed it last night.	Na ji daɗi da shi a daren jiya.
I advised him to be careful.	Na ba shi shawarar da ya yi hankali.
We must change that.	Dole ne mu canza hakan.
Give us this opportunity.	Ka ba mu wannan dama.
I wonder how that was.	Ina mamakin yadda hakan ya kasance.
And in fact, it is true.	Kuma a gaskiya, daidai ne.
So they came out.	Don haka suka fito.
Something happened, something new.	Wani abu ya faru, wani sabon abu.
No wonder she felt, she decided.	Ba mamaki ta ji, ta yanke shawarar.
I can not wait.	Ba zan iya jira ba.
He may even be here.	Yana iya ma yana nan.
I'm sure you're tired, let's go inside.	Na tabbata kun gaji, mu shiga ciki.
However, that is exactly what happened.	Duk da haka, abin da ya taɓa faruwa ke nan.
He never needed a name.	Bai taɓa buƙatar wani suna ba.
It must be kept here, in us.	Dole ne a ajiye shi a nan, a cikin mu.
It's good, good that she's here.	Yana da kyau, mai kyau cewa tana nan.
I'm not interested in it.	Ba ni da sha'awar shi.
It is not acceptable.	Ba abin yarda ba ne.
it is a waste of time.	bata lokaci ne.
Some are not so much.	Wasu ba su da yawa.
So be careful.	Don haka a kula.
Some more rain has finally come.	Wasu ƙarin ruwan sama ya zo a ƙarshe.
He feels fine.	Yana jin lafiya.
I was afraid to fly.	Na ji tsoron tashi.
They are not children.	Ni ba yaro bane.
It was an amazing trip.	Ya kasance tafiya mai ban mamaki.
I didn't get that.	Ban samu haka ba.
Everyone wants a real job.	Kowa yana son aiki na gaske.
That's right.	Daidai ne.
He can decide whatever he wants.	Zai iya yanke duk shawarar da yake so.
This is the best thing.	Wannan shi ne mafi kyawun abu.
Three died because of him.	Uku sun mutu saboda shi.
There is no truth.	Babu gaskiya.
I went back	Na koma baya
There is a bus running.	Akwai motar bas da ke gudu.
She was the one who made the mistake.	Ita ce ta yi kuskure.
Or things that aren’t good.	Ko abubuwan da ba su da kyau.
It's cold inside.	Yayi sanyi a ciki.
It's good to be back.	Yana da kyau a dawo.
You have to work in a simple way.	Dole ne ku yi aiki a hanya mai sauƙi.
Iron.	Irin .
It's hot.	Akwai zafi.
One of many.	Daya daga cikin da yawa.
This is the place.	Wannan shi ne wurin.
She removed them one by one.	Ta cire su daya bayan daya.
I can't believe it.	Ba zan iya yarda ba.
They came here.	Sun zo nan.
Through thick and thin.	Ta lokacin farin ciki da na bakin ciki.
He knew they knew something he did not know.	Ya san sun san wani abu da bai sani ba.
He did not allow them to enter.	Bai bar su su shiga shi ba.
It's just scary.	Abin ban tsoro ne kawai.
We know what happened next.	Mun san abin da ya faru daga baya.
I will take care of them.	Zan kula da su.
But this is the last chance.	Amma wannan ita ce dama ta ƙarshe.
We were coming, a lot of people were gone.	Muna zuwa, mutane da yawa sun tafi.
To protect me from him.	Don kare ni daga gare shi.
Everyone talks about that.	Kowa yayi magana akan wannan.
I should have thought about that.	Ya kamata in yi tunani a kan hakan.
So it started.	Don haka ya fara.
This is not a good thing.	Wannan ba abu ne mai kyau ba.
He looked at the door.	Ya kalli kofar.
It is a difficult task.	Aiki ne mai wahala.
I hope you enjoyed the early.	Ina fatan kun ji daɗi da wuri.
Hope you enjoy it.	Da fatan za ku samu.
I was, myself.	Na kasance, kaina.
This house is in a good location.	Wannan gidan yana cikin kyakkyawan wuri.
I wouldn’t mind at all.	Ba zan damu ba ko kadan.
We do not even hear.	Ba ma ji ba.
It is in a good location.	Yana cikin wuri mai kyau.
But still we came.	Amma duk da haka mun zo.
Things did not go well for us.	Abubuwa ba su yi mana kyau ba.
The man committed suicide.	Mutumin ya kashe kansa.
What were they?	Me suka kasance?
Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation.	Wanda tabbas zai kara bata mata rai.
He did not ask to enter the house.	Bai nemi shiga gidan ba.
She is married and has three children.	Tana da aure tana da ‘ya’ya uku.
It just so happened.	Sai kawai ya faru.
I hope this helps someone.	Ina fatan wannan zai taimaka wa wani.
The house is in a beautiful location.	Gidan yana cikin kyakkyawan wuri.
I got in, I paid, I got back in the car.	Na shiga ciki, na biya, na dawo cikin motar.
There is only one meal.	Akwai abinci ɗaya kawai.
She uses all the materials she has.	Duk kayan da take da su tana amfani da ita.
He says in fact she has but.	Yace a gaskiya tana da amma.
This therefore became the first.	Wannan saboda haka ya zama na farko.
Or for life, it seems.	Ko don rayuwa, da alama.
That statement would be false.	Wannan magana za ta zama karya.
I really do.	Ina yi da gaske.
When they arrived, the place was closed.	Lokacin da suka isa wurin, wurin ya rufe.
He was not a participant.	Bai kasance mai shiga ba.
Mu ma.	Mu ma.
I still don't know much about her.	Har yanzu ban san da yawa game da ita ba.
Pretend it doesn't exist.	Yi kamar babu shi.
I can't find this.	Ba zan iya samun wannan ba.
And maybe they need to fight.	Kuma watakila suna bukatar fada.
Day of the week.	Ranar mako.
In your time, not mine.	A lokacin ku, ba nawa ba.
I'm just looking for the truth.	Ina neman gaskiya kawai.
Some may be closer to you.	Wasu na iya zama kusa da ku.
They left today.	Sun fita yau.
I would like to.	Ina so.
Honestly, really good stuff.	Gaskiya, kayan gaske masu kyau.
Remove from heat, enjoy.	Cire daga zafi, ji daɗi.
He should stop and wait for them.	Ya kamata ya tsaya ya jira su.
I can buy this.	Zan iya siyan wannan.
He can't say when.	Ba zai iya cewa yaushe ba.
On many things he said no.	Akan abubuwa da yawa ya ce a'a.
They love me.	Suna so na.
They killed me.	Sun kashe ni.
He had never felt that way before.	Bai taba jin haka ba.
But make no mistake.	Amma kada ku yi kuskure.
I can be myself completely with him in any way.	Zan iya zama kaina gaba ɗaya tare da shi ta kowace hanya.
So things like that are very helpful.	Don haka abubuwa irin wannan suna da taimako sosai.
He never said no.	Bai taba fada ba.
We know that nothing can change the past.	Mun san cewa babu abin da zai iya canza abin da ya gabata.
She said, "No more heat."	Ta ce, "Ba sauran zafi."
They were one.	Sun kasance daya.
At this point, he needs someone to stand up for him.	A wannan lokacin, yana buƙatar wanda zai tsaya masa.
Like, the last way.	Kamar, hanya ta ƙarshe.
Time did not wait.	Lokaci bai jira ba.
This is all a big mistake.	Wannan duk babban kuskure ne.
You have a seat.	Kuna da wurin zama.
He was happy.	Ya yi farin ciki.
I do nothing.	Ba na yin komai.
We go talk.	Muna tafiya magana.
Now she waits.	Yanzu ta jira.
It can't make me write anything.	Ba zai iya sa in rubuta komai ba.
He wondered what he would do now.	Ya yi tunanin me zai yi yanzu.
He quickly ate.	Da sauri ya ci abinci.
Then something amazing happened.	Sai wani abu mai ban sha'awa ya faru.
That's what happened.	Haka abin ya faru.
It was a clever game more than anything else.	Ya kasance wasan hankali fiye da komai.
It was hot, so he decided to take a flight.	Yana da zafi, don haka ya yanke shawarar ɗaukar jirgin.
And we found out quickly.	Kuma mun gano da sauri.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
It will be confirmed.	Za a tabbatar da ita.
It is not our job.	Ba aikin mu bane.
Nothing to say.	Ba abin da za a ce.
Please take care of the children.	Don Allah a kula da yara.
I'm doing really well.	Ina yin kyau sosai.
He knew he was close.	Ya san yana kusa.
She can go out.	Zata iya fita.
Why did you cover the water?	Me yasa kuka rufe ruwan?
He became more nervous and excited all the time.	Ya ƙara jin tsoro da jin daɗi kowane lokaci.
Get the most out of reading.	Samun mafi yawan karatu.
We will go.	Za mu tafi.
I hated myself.	Na ƙi kaina.
It may be from where they came from.	Yana iya zama daga inda suka fito.
That may sound like the truth, but it is not.	Hakan na iya zama kamar gaskiya, amma ba haka ba.
So there is no doubt about it.	Don haka babu shakka game da shi.
When he first entered the room.	Lokacin da ya fara shiga dakin.
I can't edit this function.	Ba zan iya gyara wannan aikin ba.
He continued slowly.	Ya ci gaba a hankali.
Maybe they will.	Wataƙila za su yi.
Something is wrong.	Wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
It shows every day.	Ya nuna kowace rana.
The last two can’t cover it well.	Biyu na ƙarshe ba za su iya rufe shi da kyau ba.
And there are many more to come.	Kuma akwai abubuwa da yawa masu zuwa.
Although he would not kill him.	Ko da yake ba zai kashe shi ba.
Hope for the money.	Fatan kudi.
We will join you.	Za mu shiga tare da ku.
Nothing we can do cannot be done without us.	Ba abin da za mu iya yi ba za a iya yi ba tare da mu.
Wondering what that looks like.	Mamakin me hakan yayi kama.
No matter, do not be afraid.	Komai, kada ku ji tsoro.
Tell me your problem.	Faɗa mini matsalar ku.
People need to take care of the world.	Mutane suna bukatar su kula da duniya.
No, don't make me laugh.	A'a, kada ku sa ni dariya.
She has a difficult job and needs help.	Tana da aiki mai wahala kuma tana buƙatar taimako.
How does that work?	Ta yaya hakan ke aiki?
But if the kids are anything, they wonder.	Amma idan yara sun kasance wani abu, suna mamaki.
If she had not already.	Idan ba ta riga ta kasance ba.
She gave him another.	Ta sake masa wani.
People really grew up, they took something out of it.	Mutane sun yi girma da gaske, sun ɗauki wani abu daga ciki.
But be prepared to prove it.	Amma a shirya don tabbatar da hakan.
We do not need extra money.	Ba ma buƙatar ƙarin kuɗi.
So for me.	Don haka a gare ni.
We have loved watching this movie for years.	Mun sha son kallon wannan fim tsawon shekaru.
We do not pay.	Ba mu biya.
You name it.	Kuna suna shi.
He started this new project without her.	Ya fara wannan sabon aikin ba tare da ita ba.
God knows best.	Allah ne mafi sani.
This is a little bit.	Wannan kadan ne.
Get to know your users.	Ku san masu amfani da ku.
I do not know if it is a surprise.	Ban sani ba ko abin mamaki ne.
So is the world.	Haka duniya take.
And he is looking for us.	Kuma yana neman mu.
Drink a glass of water at a time.	Sha ruwan abin sha sau ɗaya a lokaci guda.
You and I are very similar.	Ni da kai, mun yi kama da juna sosai.
She did me good.	Ta yi min kyau.
They just don’t want to.	Ba su so kawai.
I tried to do everything myself.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin komai da kaina.
But we find that there is much more to do.	Amma mun gano akwai abubuwa da yawa da za mu yi.
But we can do something about it.	Amma za mu iya yin wani abu game da shi.
He just missed me.	Kawai ya rasa ni.
Drink water.	A sha ruwa.
Just sit.	Zama kawai .
They are waiting for the nice house they think they will get.	Suna jiran kyakkyawan gida da suke tunanin za su samu.
They let him begin to live.	Suka bar shi a fara zama.
He wants us to think there is time.	Yana so mu yi tunanin akwai lokaci.
To succeed, you have to hit fast.	Don yin nasara, dole ne ku buga da sauri.
He immediately saw two girls.	Nan da nan ya ga 'yan mata biyu.
God is doing this to us.	Allah yana yi mana haka.
Sorry about that.	Yi hakuri da komai.
And although there is much more to do.	Kuma ko da yake akwai sauran abubuwa da yawa a yi.
Children can not take it.	Yara ba za su iya ɗauka ba.
It is now closed.	Yanzu an rufe.
Stop in the car.	Tsaya a cikin mota.
There are things you can not do, no matter how much you want.	Akwai abubuwan da ba za ku iya yi ba, komai nawa kuke so.
Sometimes it’s great.	Wani lokaci yana da girma.
Imagine what he knew.	Ka yi tunanin abin da ya sani.
It will help us.	Zai taimake mu.
No, she did not.	A'a, ba ta yi ba.
He said nothing of what he saw.	Bai ce komai ba na abin da ya gani.
I always thought amazing things would happen that day.	A koyaushe ina tsammanin abubuwa masu ban mamaki za su faru a wannan rana.
He is tired.	Ya gaji.
It is an interesting and wonderful thing.	Abu ne mai ban sha'awa da ban mamaki.
Give him the book now.	Ka ba shi littafin yanzu.
You will never get out of your car.	Ba za ku taɓa fita daga motar ku ba.
But when they do not cry, they forget it altogether.	Amma idan ba su yi kuka ba, sun manta da shi gaba ɗaya.
No one made fun of me.	Babu wanda ya yi min dariya.
At the time.	A lokacin a lokacin.
Inside he said.	A ciki ya ce.
We did the best we could.	Mun yi mafi kyawun aikin da za mu iya.
She loves you.	Tana son ka.
Some people just stopped.	Wasu mutane sun tsaya kawai.
The water is moving a little.	Ruwan ruwa yana ɗan tafiya kaɗan.
But they are more interested.	Amma sun fi sha'awar gaske.
It is behind your money.	Yana bayan kuɗin ku.
On this trip, that will happen.	A wannan tafiya, hakan zai faru.
I have to go, or he will kill me.	Dole ne in tafi, ko ya kashe ni.
This is something new.	Wannan sabon abu ne.
Think it can do better too.	Yi tsammanin hakan na iya yin kyau kuma.
Not for fear.	Ba don tsoro ba.
But not now, not next year.	Amma ba yanzu ba, ba a shekara mai zuwa ba.
I said sure, when.	Na ce tabbas, yaushe.
And please hear me.	Kuma don Allah a ji ni.
No chance.	Babu dama.
She lost contact with her.	Ta rasa magana da ita.
Seriously, we looked.	Da gaske, mun duba.
It was a difficult time for him.	Lokaci ne mai wahala gare shi.
That's about to say it all.	Wannan game da ya ce shi duka.
They don't even really think about them.	Ba su ma tunanin gaske game da su.
when.	yaushe.
He is a big boy!	Lallai shi babban yaro ne!.
We see this happening again.	Muna ganin wannan ya sake faruwa.
This could be the funniest movie of the year.	Wannan zai iya zama fim mafi ban dariya na shekara.
She did not join them.	Ba ta shiga su ba.
You will not accept this, but he is dead!	Ba za ku yarda da wannan ba, amma ya mutu!
He did not give me a problem.	Bai ba ni matsala ba.
You could say that this is not good.	Kuna iya cewa hakan bai yi kyau ba.
Imagine you are hurting.	Ka yi tunanin kana jin rauni.
Make sure	Tabbatar
Forget tomorrow.	Ka manta da gobe.
Patience is everything.	Hakuri ya kasance komai.
Come, go with me.	Ku zo, ku yi tafiya tare da ni.
It didn’t feel like a good thing.	Bai ji kamar abu mai kyau ba.
He is close to her.	Yana kusa da ita.
This is exactly what happened here.	Wannan shi ne ainihin abin da ya faru a nan.
You only need a few.	Kuna buƙatar kaɗan kawai.
She will do anything for you.	Za ta yi maka komai.
He has never been married.	Bai taba yin aure ba.
We would love to talk to you.	Za mu ji daɗin magana da ku.
The food in the restaurant was very good.	Abincin da ke cikin gidan abincin ya kasance mai sosai.
When they are full they close.	Idan sun cika sai su rufe.
Exactly you.	Daidai da ku.
This has been done for some time.	An yi haka har wasu.
It can not be so.	Ba zai iya zama haka ba.
I can not say when.	Ba zan iya cewa yaushe.
She ate lunch fast.	Ta ci abincin rana da sauri.
Everything is fine on the job.	Komai yayi daidai akan aikin.
No one came near.	Babu wanda ya zo kusa.
Let me show you around.	Bari in nuna muku a kusa.
It's kind of weird.	Wani irin abu ne mai ban mamaki.
Money is not a matter.	Kudi ba magana ba ne.
Or they may be.	Ko kuma suna iya zama.
That came at night.	Wannan ya zo a daren.
This tells us two things.	Wannan ya gaya mana abubuwa biyu.
Sit and drive.	Zauna da tuƙi.
He does not leave home without a shirt.	Ba ya barin gida babu riga.
Looking for a week.	Neman a cikin mako.
They arrive just in time for the flight.	Suna isa a dai-dai lokacin da jirgin ya tashi.
And it is still very hot.	Kuma har yanzu yana da zafi sosai.
It could be progress, he said.	Zai iya zama ci gaba, in ji shi.
No, no, that is a mistake.	A'a, a'a, wannan kuskure ne.
The rest is just fear.	Sauran kawai tsoro.
But even that is not all.	Amma ko da wannan ba duka ba ne.
It's really real.	Yana da gaske sosai.
They love you.	Suna son ku.
I want to stay with you.	Ina so in zauna tare da ku.
No, he did not remember where they first met.	A'a bai tuna inda suka fara ganin juna ba.
They will tell you how to make them look like you.	Za su gaya muku yadda za ku sa su zama kamar ku.
The cause could not be ascertained.	An kasa gano dalilin hakan.
Two years go by.	Shekaru biyu suna tafiya.
It feels like he's back to school.	Ji yayi kamar ya dawo makaranta.
I'll stay overnight.	Zan kwana yanzu.
And that was easy money.	Kuma wannan ya kasance kuɗi mai sauƙi.
Then start telling people.	Sai ka fara gaya wa mutane.
He was.	Ya kasance.
Sorry we left you.	Yi hakuri mun bar ku.
But that is happening.	Amma hakan na faruwa.
So try it.	Don haka gwada shi.
Then something amazing happened.	Sai wani abin ban mamaki ya faru.
It was a very pleasant trip.	Tafiya ce mai daɗi sosai.
The real problem is there.	Matsalar gaske tana can.
Go get it now !.	Je ka samu yanzu!.
He is still active.	Har yanzu yana kan aiki.
It happens every year.	Yana faruwa kowace shekara.
And it is not so.	Kuma ba haka yake ba.
Remember, there will be other opportunities.	Ka tuna, za a sami wasu dama.
I think you should come with me.	Ina ganin ya kamata ku zo tare da ni.
Always looking good.	Koyaushe neman mai kyau.
One should not forget oneself.	Kada mutum ya manta da kansa.
This money will be used wisely.	Za a yi amfani da wannan kuɗin da kyau.
Everyone is sick.	Kowa yayi rashin lafiya.
I became a person who was not me.	Na zama mutum wanda ba ni ba.
I agree with that.	Na yarda da wannan.
She was afraid he would kill her.	Ta kasance tana tsoron kada ya kashe ta.
It's really now not right.	Yana da gaske ta yanzu ba haka dama.
It seems like a good time to get involved.	Da alama lokacin yayi kyau don shiga.
I don't think anyone can!	Bana jin wani zai iya!.
Call you later.	Kira ku daga baya.
I'll tell you about this little dish.	Zan ba ku labarin wannan ɗan abincin.
I was three months ago.	Ni ne wata uku da suka wuce.
Time is running out and she needs to work.	Lokaci ya isa ya wuce kuma tana buƙatar yin aiki.
He was amazing, and amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki, kuma mai ban mamaki.
She makes everything look great.	Ta sa komai yayi kama sosai.
It can take.	Zai iya ɗauka.
It grows every day.	Yana girma a kowace rana.
Other than that, this is doing.	Ban da wannan, wannan yana yi.
Probably so.	Wataƙila haka ya kasance.
But it is the same.	Amma daidai yake.
How you turn me on.	Yadda kuke kunna ni.
I know there is a chance.	Na san akwai damar hakan.
They sold it to us.	Suka sayar mana.
You can not see.	Ba za ku iya gani ba.
Not because he is a big man.	Ba don shi babban mutum ba ne.
He never told me the whole story.	Bai taba ba ni labarin duka ba.
Everyone is fine with me.	Kowa yana lafiya tare da ni.
From top to bottom.	Daga sama har kasa.
It should be right.	Kamata yayi daidai.
Of course she lives in fear to this day.	Ba shakka tana rayuwa cikin tsoro har yau.
Write the story you remember from watching them.	Rubuta labarin abin da kuka tuna daga kallon su.
Yet, years later he is still here.	Amma duk da haka, bayan shekaru har yanzu yana nan.
Of course, we can not.	Tabbas, ba za mu iya ba.
They were weak.	Sun kasance masu rauni.
But we did not make the world.	Amma ba mu yi duniya ba.
I refused to do it.	Na ƙi yin shi.
This is a surprise.	Wannan abin mamaki ne.
I could not do anything to help her at the time.	Ba zan iya yin komai don taimaka mata ba a lokacin.
He is not in the program.	Ba ya cikin shirin.
What you do, and who you are.	Abin da kuke yi, kuma ku wanene.
Life protected him.	Rayuwa ta kare masa.
But it is delicious.	Amma yana da daɗi.
No one ran.	Babu wanda ya gudu.
She would never know anyone like me, she said.	Ba za ta taɓa sanin kowa kamar ni ba, in ji ta.
He knows them.	Ya san su ne.
But so it is with the world.	Amma haka duniya take.
He would not mind.	Ba zai damu ba.
I have never seen anything like it.	Ban taba ganin irin wannan abu ba.
Do not change anything.	Kada ku canza komai.
We took this course here.	Mun dauki wannan hanya a nan.
We just have to.	Dole ne mu kawai.
Kill me, take the money.	Ku kashe ni, ku ɗauki kuɗin.
It feels really good.	Yana jin dadi sosai.
But what you say is true.	Amma abin da kuka faɗa gaskiya ne.
To me, everything that happened was bad.	A gare ni, duk abin da ya faru ba shi da kyau.
He fell into the room.	Ya fad'a cikin d'akin.
But we are coming now.	Amma muna zuwa yanzu.
It will appear that you are right.	Zai bayyana cewa kun yi daidai.
There are surprises.	Akwai abubuwan mamaki.
If you will.	Idan kuna so.
It will probably rain tonight.	Wataƙila za a yi ruwan sama a daren yau.
I'm glad he did.	Na yi farin ciki da ya yi.
He opened the car door.	Ya bude kofar motar.
You may know without knowing.	Kuna iya sani ba tare da sani ba.
I need it.	Ina bukata.
Done.	An gama.
I can not do anything.	Ba zan iya yin komai ba.
I think that's just what's happening.	Ina ganin abin da ke faruwa ne kawai.
When he came here, he was very ill.	A lokacin da ya zo nan, ya yi rashin lafiya sosai.
What they saw surprised them.	Abin da suka gani ya ba su mamaki.
The decision was made to go.	Shawarar aka yi ta tafi.
It was exactly what it was.	Ya kasance daidai abin da yake.
I get that.	Ina samun haka.
But it seems too much, too fast.	Amma da alama yayi yawa, yayi sauri.
There is no progress.	Babu wani ci gaba.
How many are two?	Nawa biyu ne.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
You are beyond that.	Kun wuce haka.
And that would certainly be a problem.	Kuma tabbas hakan zai zama matsala.
They said nothing about it.	Ba su ce komai ba game da hakan.
It all started with one person working.	Duk abin ya fara da aikin mutum ɗaya.
I asked how many they got.	Na tambayi nawa suka samu.
He did not expect that.	Bai yi tsammanin haka ba.
She understood why he was skeptical.	Ta fahimci dalilin da ya sa ya yi shakka.
It should not be.	Bai kamata ba.
We are on the game.	Muna kan wasan.
Now it doesn't look very good.	Yanzu abin ba shi da kama sosai.
Whatever it looks like.	Ko me yayi kama.
It hurts a lot today.	Yau yayi min zafi sosai.
They are the best.	Su ne mafi kyau.
Absolutely no pain.	Babu shakka babu zafi.
It is raining.	An yi ruwan sama.
There is no such thing.	Irin wannan babu kuma.
They just work.	Suna aiki kawai.
And sometimes they do not.	Kuma wani lokacin ba sa.
I heard all this.	Na ji duk wannan.
We will not stop there.	Ba za mu tsaya kan wannan ba.
I think we're back in it.	Ina tsammanin mun dawo a ciki.
None were found at the time.	Ba a sami ko ɗaya ba a lokacin.
That has come a long way, he said.	Wannan ya kai har ya zuwa, in ji shi.
But they are gone now.	Amma sun tafi yanzu.
How to play it.	Yadda za a yi wasa da shi.
You feel good about yourself.	Kuna jin dadi a gare ku.
Maybe you can tell him something like that.	Wataƙila za ku gaya masa wani abu kamar haka.
I was terrified and hurt.	Na ji tsoro sosai kuma na ji rauni.
They don't want to look, you know.	Ba su so su duba, ka sani.
But you feel really good.	Amma kun ji sosai.
She drank coffee.	Kofi ta sha.
I know him from the article.	Na san shi daga labarin.
That is his job.	Aikin sa kenan.
But there is nothing she can do about it.	Amma babu abin da za ta iya yi game da shi.
So did they.	Haka su ma suka ci gaba.
Of course, many were excluded.	Tabbas, an cire mutane da yawa.
I caught up quickly.	Na kama da sauri.
You can add things to it as you wish.	Kuna iya ƙara abubuwa zuwa gare shi yadda kuke so.
I'm just saying.	Ina cewa kawai.
There was something she did right.	Akwai abin da ta yi daidai.
By my owner.	Da mai ni.
And they still came.	Kuma har yanzu sun zo.
He knows what to expect now.	Ya san abin da zai jira yanzu.
Children are sick.	Yara suna rashin lafiya.
Many can make mistakes.	Da yawa na iya yin kuskure.
The water is not cold.	Ruwan bai yi sanyi ba.
He wanted it somewhere.	Ya so yana wani wuri.
So of course something is wrong.	Don haka babu shakka wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
But eat now.	Amma ku ci yanzu.
He has wives and children.	Yana da mata da yara.
She is alone.	Ita kadai.
He knew that only he could do that.	Ya san cewa shi kadai zai iya yin hakan.
It’s so exciting, so exciting.	Abin farin ciki ne sosai, mai ban sha'awa.
Keep trying until you find it.	Ci gaba da gwada har sai kun sami shi.
I have not heard anything about this.	Ban ji komai game da wannan ba.
Yet he continued to do so.	Duk da haka ya ci gaba da yin haka.
It’s a lot of things like that.	Yana da abubuwa masu yawa irin wannan.
All you need is a hot tub.	Abin da kuke bukata shine mai zafi.
They seemed to be laughing.	Da alama suka yi dariya.
He won a lot.	Ya ci nasara da yawa.
Turn it on.	Kunna shi.
He said he encountered this method himself.	Ya ce ya ci karo da wannan hanyar da kansa.
The man was very happy that night.	Mutumin ya yi farin ciki sosai a daren.
Don't just read.	Kada ku karanta kawai.
She has never done so well.	Ba ta taba yin kyau haka ba.
Don't give up though you will.	Kada ku daina ko da yake za ku so.
So events like this are good.	Don haka abubuwan da suka faru irin wannan suna da kyau.
They do it for money.	Suna yin hakan ne don kuɗi.
At first, they didn't buy anything.	Da farko, ba su sayi komai ba.
I completely failed to do that.	Gaba daya na kasa yin hakan.
He said, very much.	Ya fad'a, sosai.
Looks like it's not a big deal.	Kamar ba wani babban abu ba ne.
That was amazing.	Hakan ya ban mamaki.
They are so beautiful.	Sun yi kyau sosai.
Everyone can enjoy them.	Kowa na iya jin daɗin su.
They are many.	Suna da yawa.
Time to get a job.	Lokaci don samun aiki.
Now that has changed.	Yanzu wannan ya canza.
He knew he would never succeed.	Ya san ba zai taba yin nasara ba.
The world says stop.	Duniya ta ce ku daina.
I started really well.	Na fara da kyau sosai.
It feels like it but it's not.	Ji yayi kamar shi amma ba haka ba.
He would not tell anyone what he had seen for a week.	Ba zai gaya wa kowa abin da ya gani tsawon mako guda ba.
He wants to talk to all of you.	Yana son yin magana da ku duka.
He used to be very nice to me.	Ya kasance yana min kyau sosai.
Let us try.	Ka sa mu gwada.
It is now or never.	Yanzu ne ko taba.
I should not think it is true.	Kada in yi tunanin gaskiya ne.
Tell each other this story.	Ku gaya wa juna wannan labarin.
I need to find out.	Ina bukata in gano.
I really agree.	Na yarda sosai.
I was traveling with someone at the time.	Ina tafiya tare da wani a lokacin.
I'm sure she is.	Na tabbata ita ce.
We do not know.	Ba mu sani ba.
She does not want to accept that.	Ba ta son yarda da wannan.
I want to join you	Ina so in shiga ku
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution.	Ya zuwa yanzu babu wanda ya samu.
It's too much.	An yi yawa sosai.
The doctor said it was appropriate.	Likitan ya ce ya dace.
They do not want to talk about it.	Ba sa son magana game da shi.
Attention too.	Hankali ya yi yawa.
We just know that moment.	Mu kawai mun san wannan lokacin.
That's right.	Haka yake.
Nor are they alone.	Haka kuma ba su kadai ba.
Just do it.	A yi kawai.
A lot of help should be given.	Ya kamata a taimaka da yawa.
Not at the right time.	Ba daidai lokacin ba.
That's what came out.	Abin da ya fita kenan.
We are working to fix the problem.	Muna aiki don gyara matsalar.
Clever, but happy.	Mai hankali, amma farin ciki.
Today, it is not so.	Yau, ba haka ba.
Remove from heat and let stand overnight.	Cire daga zafi kuma bari ya tsaya na dare.
These are the things you should do.	Waɗannan su ne abubuwan da ya kamata ku yi.
Can you accept it?	Za a iya yarda da shi?
I just want to read this book.	Ina son karanta wannan littafin kawai.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
You will not get a second chance.	Ba za ku sami dama ta biyu ba.
Sometimes it takes a little while.	Wani lokaci yana ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
It's a big brother.	Babban yaya ne.
I am an international citizen.	Ni dan kasa ne na duniya.
I have never had a homemaker.	Ban taɓa samun ɗan gida ba.
All this will take time.	Duk wannan zai ɗauki lokaci.
This is not unusual.	Hakan ba saba ba ne.
It was late yesterday.	Ya kwana jiya.
Whatever it is, this person is not.	Ko menene, wannan mutumin ba shi ba ne.
He is in the making.	Yana cikin yin.
But it will not come to her.	Amma ba zai zo mata ba.
God intervened.	Allah ya shiga hannu.
They tried it and they liked it.	Sun gwada shi kuma suna son shi.
It is time to change things.	Lokaci ya yi da za a canza abubuwa.
Knowing what you know is not difficult if you apply it yourself.	Sanin abin da kuka sani ba shi da wahala idan kun yi amfani da kanku.
Start from the bottom.	Ka fara daga kasa.
Sometimes when you are close to people, you just feel good.	Wani lokaci idan kuna kusa da mutane, kawai kuna jin daɗi.
We have to talk to her about this.	Dole ne mu yi magana da ita game da wannan.
They make me sad.	Suna bata min rai.
I saw her dead.	Na ga ta mutu.
Where were we?	Ina muka kasance?
He just agreed.	Kawai ya yarda.
It is always good to look at these things.	Yana da kyau koyaushe a duba waɗannan abubuwan.
But we are still here.	Amma duk da haka muna nan.
Need to get a car.	Bukatar samun mota.
This is what we want to do about it.	Wannan shi ne abin da muke so mu yi game da shi.
Come on, you must meet her.	Zo, dole ne ku hadu da ita.
He enjoys swimming.	Yana jin daɗin yin iyo.
She did not know what to expect.	Ba ta san abin da ake bukata ba.
You need to take care of it too.	Kuna buƙatar kula da ita kuma.
Seek help.	Nemi taimako.
I know everything, remember.	Na san komai, ku tuna.
There can be no better time than now.	Ba za a iya samun lokaci mafi kyau fiye da yanzu.
It uses things.	Yana amfani da abubuwa.
Nothing kills you but thoughts.	Ba abin da ya kashe ku sai tunani.
We have to be.	Dole ne mu zama .
No, they are not.	A'a, ba su bane.
We must rise to the occasion.	Dole ne mu tashi mu ci gaba da ci gaba a rayuwa.
He told me.	Ya gaya mani.
The things we do for the world.	Abubuwan da muke yi wa duniya ne.
And it did not stop.	Kuma bai daina ba.
It has been changed, completely.	An canza shi, gaba ɗaya.
No one was injured.	Babu wanda ya ji rauni.
This decision is not a joke.	Ba a yanke wannan shawarar da wasa ba.
What does a cruise ship look like?	Menene kama tashi jirgin ruwa?
You always know after you are two.	Kullum kuna sani bayan kun kasance biyu.
He loves everyone.	Yana son kowa.
I was close to her.	Na kusa da ita.
He did not know anyone there.	Bai san kowa a wurin ba.
Little was said on the train to the place.	Kadan aka ce a jirgin zuwa wurin.
Need to eat to be able to sleep.	Bukatar ci don samun damar yin barci.
So get in the way.	Ta haka ku shiga hanya.
I have been able to work so far.	Na sami damar yin aiki har zuwa yanzu.
He gets that.	Yana samun haka.
You need to study.	Kuna buƙatar yin karatu.
I want to use a song.	Ina so in yi amfani da ɗan waƙa.
They work, very fast.	Suna aiki, da sauri.
Or learn the hard way what you are facing.	Ko koyi hanya mai wahala abin da kuke gaba da shi.
This will help things to be as they are.	Wannan zai taimaka abubuwa su kasance kamar yadda suke.
And he really died.	Kuma ya mutu da gaske.
I love her completely.	Ina son ta gaba daya.
Do not cut it properly.	Kar a yanke shi da kyau.
Forget food.	Manta da abinci.
We don't play well with others.	Ba ma wasa da kyau da wasu.
They told us we didn't know anything.	Suka ce mana ba mu san komai ba.
And there is something.	Kuma akwai wani abu.
It will be very difficult.	Zai yi wuya sosai.
I need to say.	Ina bukata in ce.
But this is the first meeting of the year.	Amma wannan shi ne taron farko na shekara.
I am not the only one who understands this.	Ba ni kadai ne na gane wannan ba.
I hope everyone around you got some of it.	Ina fata duk wanda ke kusa da nan ya sami wasu daga ciki.
To run takes only a.	Don gudu yana ɗaukar kawai a.
He put her in his place.	Ya ajiye ta a wurin shi.
There is food and water.	Akwai abinci da ruwa.
He did not, of course.	Bai yi ba, ba shakka.
When this happens.	Lokacin da wannan ya faru.
They need to work.	Suna buƙatar yin aiki.
She said it took time.	Ta ce ya dauki lokaci.
He could not help her.	Ba zai iya taimaka mata ba.
Come and sit down.	Zo ku zauna.
It can be done as follows.	Ana iya yin haka kamar haka.
Maybe, for a while.	Wataƙila, na ɗan lokaci.
It would be nice if someone could help.	Yana da kyau idan wani ya ba da taimako.
Please, you must accept me now.	Don Allah, dole ne ku yarda da ni yanzu.
Or what is this.	Ko menene wannan.
Or you can fight me.	Ko kuma za ku iya fada da ni.
Still, not a bad thought.	Har yanzu, ba mummunan tunani ba.
Someone needs to do it.	Wani yana buƙatar yin shi.
She did not eat or drink.	Ba ta ci ba ta sha.
I will be happy.	Zan ji daɗi.
As you said, there is no point in killing something that will happen somehow.	Kamar yadda ka ce, babu amfani a kashe abin da zai faru ko ta yaya.
He did not appear to be injured in any way.	Bai bayyana ya ji rauni ba ta kowace hanya.
Honestly I don't know where to start.	Gaskiya ban san ta ina zan fara ba.
It seems to be working now.	Da alama yana aiki yanzu.
Everyone is tired.	Kowa ya gaji.
I think he came here for you.	Ina tsammanin ya zo nan saboda ku.
I remember this article.	Na tuna wannan labarin.
It's so much more interesting.	Ya fi ban sha'awa sosai.
But he was, and will be.	Amma ya kasance, kuma zai kasance.
He is a human being, we have made a mistake.	Shi kuma mutum, kuskure ne da muka yi.
You can see it below.	Haka za ku iya gani a kasa.
One week passed.	Mako guda ya wuce.
He never used them.	Bai taba amfani da su ba.
I do not know when.	Ban san yaushe ba.
I think he is there.	Ina jin yana can.
She did not understand.	Ba ta gane haka ba.
He’s just trying to help.	Yana ƙoƙarin taimaka kawai.
Apparently it was also used.	Ga alama ma an yi amfani da shi.
I know him now.	Na san shi yanzu.
I think he can play.	Ina tsammanin zai iya wasa.
It worked well.	Ya yi aiki mai kyau.
Something you have never done before.	Wani abu da baka taba yi ba.
Some are accustomed to eating very little.	Wasu sun saba cin abinci kaɗan ne kawai.
Although it would be nice.	Ko da yake zai yi kyau.
As it was, he never had a chance to kill them.	Kamar yadda yake, bai taɓa samun damar kashe su ba.
It can be.	Zai iya zama.
Please, you must believe me.	Don Allah, dole ne ku yarda da ni.
The recommendation will be sent to you at home.	Za a aika maka da shawarar a gida.
It was even liked.	Har ma an so shi.
Of course, he does not have one.	Tabbas, bashi da daya.
Imagine what it would be like, if she were present.	Ka yi tunanin yadda zai kasance, idan tana nan a yanzu.
Or there.	Ko kuma a wurin.
Not the kind of place you want to be.	Ba irin wurin da kuke so ku kasance ba.
Let that night come, or go on.	Da a bari wannan daren ya zo, ko kuma a ci gaba.
But she does not know where he is.	Amma bata san inda yake ba.
But that would be a mistake.	Amma wannan zai zama kuskure.
Send them forward.	Ka aika su gaba.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
I have never been married.	Ban taba yin aure ba.
One right after another.	Daya dama bayan daya.
And what a surprise.	Kuma ga abin mamaki.
The process was very time consuming.	Hanyar ta kasance mai cin lokaci sosai.
So I am glad that you are with us today.	Don haka ina farin cikin cewa kuna tare da mu a yau.
And I know a lot about it.	Kuma na san abubuwa da yawa game da shi.
We can find out something.	Za mu iya gano wani abu.
I can get behind the scenes about that.	Zan iya samun bayan fim game da hakan.
This cannot be confirmed.	Ba za a iya tabbatar da hakan ba.
One by one they fell asleep.	Daya bayan daya suka yi barci.
No need to answer.	Babu bukatar amsa.
I think what can not be there.	Ina ganin abin da ba zai iya zama a can.
I want you to come with me.	Ina so ku zo tare da ni.
We can talk a lot tomorrow.	Za mu iya magana da yawa gobe.
You know.	Kun sani.
He can't swim, so make a swimmer!	Ba zai iya yin iyo ba, don haka sa mai iyo!
Everyone was helpful, involved and helpful.	Kowa ya kasance mai taimako, shiga da amfani.
Now that you have come here you must stay.	Yanzu da kun zo nan dole ne ku zauna.
The same for everyone, really.	Haka ga kowa da kowa, da gaske.
He can speak only when he wants to.	Zai yi magana ne kawai lokacin da ya so.
He wanted them to come home.	Ya so su zo gida.
They look at each other for a long time.	Kallon juna suke yi na tsawon lokaci.
And after that, it was for me.	Kuma bayan haka, shi ne a gare ni.
Otherwise, he may try to protect me.	In ba haka ba, yana iya ƙoƙarin kare ni.
Please remember what you should bring.	Da fatan za a tuna abin da ya kamata ku kawo.
Hope this helps with your advice.	Fata wannan ya ɗan taimaka da shawarar ku.
I did not apply for the job.	Ban nemi aikin ba.
I think you will get what you want in the end.	Ina tsammanin za ku sami abin da kuke so a ƙarshe.
And you see what happened to that.	Kuma kun ga abin da ya faru da wannan.
We used to do them.	Mun kasance muna yin su.
Even tired he continued.	Ko da ya gaji ya ci gaba.
I told him so much that only he would know the truth.	Na fada masa da yawa wanda shi kadai zai san gaskiya ne.
You will think of something.	Za ku yi tunanin wani abu.
This way .	Ga hanya .
There is little to say.	Akwai kadan da za a ce.
The book of life.	Littafin rayuwa.
But not for man.	Amma ba don mutum ba.
It still feels good, though !.	Har yanzu ya ji dadi, ko da yake!.
Die with you.	Mutu tare da ku.
I understand that.	Na fahimci hakan.
Which is exactly what he did.	Wanda shi ne ainihin abin da ya yi.
He decided to work at home.	Ya yanke shawarar yin aiki a gida.
Something bigger than money.	Wani abu ya fi kudi girma.
She is with them now.	Tana tare da su yanzu.
Someone has, though.	Wani yana da, ko da yake.
He saved me some things.	Ya ajiye min wasu abubuwa.
They sit next to you.	Suka zauna a kusa da ku.
We cannot let them die.	Ba za mu iya barin su su mutu ba.
And stay there, or higher.	Kuma zauna a can, ko mafi girma.
Much, we can agree.	Da yawa, za mu iya yarda.
Anyway, here it goes.	Ko ta yaya, nan ya tafi.
He wanted to get out there.	Ya so ya fita can.
I came here on my own.	Na zo nan da kaina.
Something was left out.	An bar wani abu.
Everything is ready.	An shirya duka.
Maybe I can continue.	Wataƙila zan iya ci gaba.
However, that will happen.	Duk da haka, hakan zai faru.
They did not expect that.	Ba su yi tsammanin haka ba.
I tried but it didn’t change anything.	Na gwada amma bai canza komai ba.
He said nothing.	Bai ce komai ba.
He spent years there.	Ya yi shekaru a can.
There will be no talk.	Ba za a yi magana ba.
But still she is here, let it happen.	Amma duk da haka tana nan, bari ya faru.
And everything that happens in it.	Kuma duk abin da ya faru a ciki.
But fine with me.	Amma lafiya tare da ni.
Of course, he did.	Tabbas, ya yi.
We come to you.	Mu zo gare ku.
I like everything about this night.	Ina son komai game da wannan dare.
He was right, of course.	Ya yi daidai, ba shakka.
There is little and they have a walk.	Akwai kadan kuma suna da tafiya.
And we can fix it.	Kuma za mu iya gyara shi.
I refuse to write that.	Na ƙi rubuta haka.
I can't say that.	Ba zan iya cewa haka ba.
He got a chance.	Ya samu damar.
This is a statement.	Wannan magana fada ce.
I can't see anything.	Bana ganin komai.
I don't know of any problems but he will try it.	Ban san kowane matsala ba amma zai gwada shi.
Nothing happened to the man.	Babu wani abu da ya faru da mutumin.
We can hear the train.	Muna iya jin jirgin.
We are accustomed to the sun.	Mun saba da rana.
So do the others.	Haka kuma sauran.
We have never seen a movie together.	Ba mu taba ganin wani fim tare ba.
It could be another way.	Zai iya zama wata hanya.
I never thought of that.	Ban taba tunanin hakan ba.
She sat down.	Ta zauna.
He just did.	Ya yi kawai.
This will change the game.	Wannan zai canza wasan.
I enjoyed the food and hope it is more fulfilling.	Na ji daɗin abincin kuma ina fata ya fi cika.
He would rather be arrested at the station.	Gara a kama shi a tashar.
I look forward to working with you again.	Ina fatan sake yin aiki tare da ku.
Then the train came the other way.	Sai jirgin kasa ya zo ta wata hanya.
For a long time nothing happened.	Na dade ba abin da ya faru.
They were successful and very happy.	Sun yi nasara kuma sun yi farin ciki sosai.
I sat in fear.	Na zauna cikin tsoro.
There is no hope for them.	Babu fata gare su.
Needless to say.	Babu bukatar ma a ce haka.
He got up and quickly got ready.	Ya tashi ya shirya da sauri.
Everyone will wait.	Kowa zai jira.
They say they made a mistake.	Sun ce sun yi kuskure.
I knew he would come.	Na san zai zo.
This is a big job.	Wannan babban aiki ne.
But it's about a lot more than that.	Amma yana da game da yawa fiye da haka ma.
The players did not mind the cold.	'Yan wasan ba su damu da sanyi ba.
I agree with that.	Na yarda da hakan.
We should be afraid not to be you.	Ya kamata mu ji tsoron kada mu zama ku.
If we pay, we are safe.	Idan mun biya, muna da lafiya.
I just thought.	Na yi tunani kawai.
He’s also getting something.	Shi ma yana samun wani abu.
Prepare for me tomorrow.	Ka shirya min gobe.
We could not help him.	Ba mu iya taimaka masa ba.
They just want to be heard.	Suna so kawai a ji su.
He was a thinker.	Ya kasance mai tunani.
I do not like to read what they say about us.	Ba na son karanta abin da suke cewa game da mu.
We will work on something.	Za mu yi aiki da wani abu.
I can't find it.	Ba zan iya samun shi ba.
He used to go out before eating.	Ya kasance yana fita kafin cin abinci.
Shouldn't you be making more money?	Shin bai kamata ku kasance kuna samun ƙarin kuɗi ba?
But sometimes you want a sweet drink.	Amma wani lokacin kuna son abin sha mai daɗi.
Of course you did.	Tabbas kun yi daidai.
Getting a real person.	Samun ainihin mutum.
I come whether you like it or not.	Ina zuwa ko kuna so ko ba ku so.
Women should make it home.	Ya kamata mata su yi gida.
He raises his hand and points.	Ya daga hannu ya nuna.
You start paying.	Ka fara biya.
I do not think they will all win.	Ba na jin za su ci nasara duka.
Nothing has changed.	Babu wani abu da ya canza.
We enjoyed reading the article again.	Mun ji daɗin sake karanta labarin.
He took it.	Da ya dauka.
You will not be able to see them.	Ba za ku iya ganin su ba.
I said he was not there.	Na ce ba ya nan.
You can walk at night.	Kuna iya tafiya cikin dare.
She surprised him, sometimes.	Ta ba shi mamaki, wani lokacin.
They are more than anything in the world.	Sun kasance fiye da komai a duniya.
He will talk to her later.	Zai yi magana da ita daga baya.
Not much has changed.	Ba abu mai yawa ya canza ba.
He did not know that there was such a place.	Bai san akwai wannan wurin ba.
You eat.	Kuna ci.
No one is fighting.	Babu mai fada.
He prepared delicious food for us.	Ya shirya mana abinci mai dadi.
We know he is lying about that.	Mun san karya yake yi game da hakan.
I really like this.	Ina son wannan sosai.
The children bring lunch and eat at school.	Yara suna kawo abincin rana suna ci a makaranta.
He does not speak.	Bata magana.
I would not like it.	Ba zan so shi ba.
This tastes really good.	Wannan yayi dadi sosai.
I talk a lot.	Ina magana da yawa.
I wrote about life before I got sick.	Na rubuta game da rayuwa kafin in yi rashin lafiya.
What a trip !.	Me tafiya!.
You are hot now.	Kuna da zafi yanzu.
You can not stay here.	Ba za ku iya zama a nan ba.
Of course there are 'right' and 'wrong' ways to do that though.	Tabbas akwai hanyar 'dama' da 'kuskure' don yin hakan ko da yake.
I really like that.	Ina son hakan sosai.
Our users will not do that.	Masu amfani da mu ba za su yi hakan ba.
It may be hot there.	Yana iya yin zafi a wurin.
Maybe he tried something at some point.	Wataƙila ya gwada wani abu a wani lokaci.
So it was amazing when you first got there.	Don haka yana da ban mamaki lokacin da kuka fara zuwa wurin.
However, this was done involuntarily.	Duk da haka, an yi hakan ne ba tare da son rai ba.
We are not everyone.	Mu ba kowa bane.
They will eventually get used to you.	Za su saba da ku daga ƙarshe.
I want you to show me.	Ina so ka nuna min.
We will take you to our empty room at the landlord's place.	Za mu kai dakin mu da ba kowa a wurin mai gida.
So it was enough.	Don haka ya isa.
So let's understand it.	Don haka bari mu gane shi.
The night is coming, when no one can work.	Dare yana zuwa, lokacin da ba wanda zai iya yin aiki.
It's interesting.	Abin sha'awa ne.
He will always love me.	Zai so ni koyaushe.
They talked about you so much.	Sun yi magana game da ku sosai.
Of course we are.	Tabbas muna.
She doesn't want to be caught like that.	Ba ta son a kama ta haka.
He did not think he was doing anything unusual.	Bai yi tunanin yana yin wani abu da ba a saba gani ba.
This year more than ever.	Wannan shekara fiye da kowane lokaci.
We will be safe.	Za mu kasance lafiya.
It is so much bigger.	Ya fi haka girma.
I signed up for it.	Na shiga saboda shi.
I remember her very well now.	Na tuna da ita sosai yanzu.
Maybe she made a mistake.	Wataƙila ta yi kuskure.
No one can tell you what the job was but the name.	Babu wanda zai iya gaya muku aikin da ya kasance amma suna.
No children.	Babu yara.
And honestly, more than no.	Kuma gaskiya, fiye da a'a.
We have nothing to fear.	Ba mu da wani abin tsoro.
I killed people.	Na kashe mutane.
He wants to see a little bit of the world.	Yana son ganin kadan daga cikin duniya.
Funny and it works really well.	Abin dariya kuma yana aiki sosai.
The story you gave them.	Labarin da ka ba su ne.
That is too much.	Hakan ya yi yawa.
You are, at best, second to him.	Kai ne, a mafi kyau, na biyu a gare shi.
They looked for a way.	Suka nemi hanya.
This, of course, is not true.	Wannan, ba shakka ba gaskiya ba ne.
But he did not get it.	Amma bai samu ba.
She could not begin to think so.	Ta kasa fara tunanin hakan.
I suggest we stay together.	Na ba da shawarar mu zauna tare.
Before the police arrived.	Kafin 'yan sanda su zo.
You know the big thing.	Kun san babban abu.
I learned a lot about how to best communicate with people.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa game da yadda zan fi yin magana da mutane.
He said women are the best.	Yace mata sun fi kowa kyau.
They will know how to fix it.	Za su san yadda za a gyara ta.
I know exactly how you feel.	Na san ainihin yadda kuke ji.
It is not complete.	Ba ta cika ba.
She was at the meeting.	Ta kasance a wurin taron.
We have to go now.	Dole mu tafi yanzu.
I drink	ina sha
They will pay you a lot.	Za su biya ku da yawa.
Say so.	Ka ce haka.
Take things in stride and try not focus too much on the problem.	Ka ɗauka a hankali za ka iya tafiya daidai.
Sit down.	Ku zauna.
But this is not true.	Amma wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
They were for us.	Sun kasance a gare mu.
There is truth in what she says.	Akwai gaskiya a cikin abin da take cewa.
He does not feel well.	Ba ya jin dadi.
There is nothing that he does not like.	Babu wani abu da yake gani wanda baya so.
Do not go alone.	Kada ku tafi kai kaɗai.
I have to play well to keep going.	Dole ne in yi wasa da kyau in ci gaba.
One person cannot change the world.	Mutum daya ba zai iya canza duniya ba.
And even a cold house is better than anyone else.	Kuma ko gidan sanyi ya fi kowa.
What we saw was metal.	Wanda muka gani karfe ne.
I do not understand though.	Ban gane ba ko da yake.
But he could not touch her.	Amma ya kasa taba ta.
I didn't even talk to the man much.	Ban ma yi wa mutumin magana da yawa ba.
You want to move on.	Kuna son ci gaba.
But think again.	Amma sake tunani.
No difficulty.	Babu wahala.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
But this time, it will not be so easy.	Amma wannan lokacin, ba zai zama da sauƙi haka ba.
But right now, what you are doing is very good.	Amma a yanzu, abin da kuke yi yana da kyau sosai.
You would not want to be there.	Ba za ku so ku kasance a wurin ba.
The house is nothing new.	Gidan ba sabon abu bane.
We get that a lot.	Muna samun hakan da yawa.
A pleasure for you.	Wani abin jin daɗi a gare ku.
It 's good to see you again.	Yana da kyau in sake ganin ku.
No need to move on. 	Babu buƙatar ci gaba. 
So we went out to eat.	Sai muka fita cin abinci.
And it's cold.	Kuma tana da sanyi.
I worked for a long time.	Na yi aiki na tsawon lokaci.
He said something about the drink it was delicious.	Ya fad'a wani abu game da abin sha yana da daɗi.
They are as healthy as we know.	Suna lafiya kamar yadda muka sani.
First, you must know how to get there.	Na farko, dole ne ku san yadda za ku isa wurin.
Mark the wrong place, and you will lose some time.	Yi alama a wurin da ba daidai ba, kuma za ku rasa ɗan lokaci.
You think.	Kuna tunani.
We agree with that.	Mun yarda da wannan.
Run fast!	Gudu da sauri!
I wonder this.	Ina mamakin wannan.
Come on in, take a look and enjoy yourself!	Ku zo yanzu, ku ce shi ne abin da yake.
It is very difficult to write, but it can be done.	Yana da matukar wahala a rubuta, amma ana iya yin hakan.
But no one laughed.	Amma babu wanda ya yi dariya.
You got it.	Ka samu.
His mind is tired.	Tunanin da yayi ya gaji.
And they were not happy when she surprised them.	Kuma ba su ji daɗi ba lokacin da ta ba su mamaki.
Continue fast.	Ci gaba da sauri.
I'm looking forward to it one day.	Ina duba wata rana.
Never for a moment.	Kada na wani lokaci.
And take whatever you can carry.	Kuma ɗauki duk abin da za ku iya ɗauka.
But that's enough, you know.	Amma wannan ya isa, ka sani.
But even that is good.	Amma ko da hakan yayi kyau.
You have to earn money to spend money.	Dole ne ku sami kuɗi don kashe kuɗi.
They were unknown.	Sun kasance ba a sani ba.
Too much for everyone.	Ya yi yawa ga kowa.
He did not ask her once.	Bai tambaye ta sau daya ba.
Something is going on.	Akwai wani abu da ke faruwa.
Many people have written to me about this problem.	Mutane da yawa sun rubuta mini wannan matsala.
And something is better than nothing.	Kuma wani abu ya fi komai kyau.
It will never be the same again.	Ba za a sake zama ba.
But that did not surprise him.	Amma hakan bai sa shi ban mamaki ba.
But first she asked how it was.	Amma da farko ta tambayi yadda ya kasance.
Cut me down.	Yanke ni kasa.
There is no way to turn this off.	Babu yadda za a kashe wannan.
You have never been here.	Ba ka taba zuwa nan ba.
He spoke very well.	Yayi magana sosai da kyau.
They saw what you did, you and others.	Sun ga abin da kuka yi, ku da sauran.
This allows us to check everything in advance.	Wannan yana ba mu dama don duba komai lafiya tukuna.
The opposite.	Wanda ya saba.
It wasn't until the next morning that she worked.	Sai da safe ta yi aiki.
The one that hurts.	Wanda kuma ya yi zafi.
There will be many people there.	Za a sami mutane da yawa a wurin.
He must have been out of action without a real day.	Dole ne ya kasance daga yin ba tare da ainihin rana ba.
I learned it in school.	Na koyi shi a makaranta.
But somehow, it did not work out.	Amma ko ta yaya, bai yi daidai ba.
Do not do this again.	Kar a sake yin wannan.
Otherwise, they would have been out of it.	In ba haka ba, da sun yi waje da shi.
She parked the car and slowly moved back.	Ta ajiye motar ta koma a hankali.
Good local fish.	Kifi mai kyau na gida.
She has been since.	Ta kasance tun.
Of course you know.	Tabbas kun sani.
Too much for one.	Ya yi yawa ga ɗaya.
I do not understand that you are sick.	Ban gane cewa ba ku da lafiya.
I hope they don't mind.	Ina fata ba za su damu ba.
I’ll talk to myself here though.	Zan yi magana da kaina a nan ko da yake.
Why would.	Me yasa zai .
No one is perfect.	Babu wanda ya cika.
Now that will never happen.	Yanzu hakan ba zai taba faruwa ba.
So they went on to say.	Haka suka ci gaba da cewa.
I never liked her.	Ban taba son ta ba.
You don't want her to be alone.	Ba ka so ta kasance ita kaɗai.
I don't want this to ever happen.	Ba na son wannan ya taba faruwa.
Only once.	Sau ɗaya kawai.
He was serious.	Ya kasance da gaske.
And now no one wants to look.	Kuma yanzu babu wanda yake so ya duba.
And maybe what it was.	Kuma watakila abin da ya kasance.
The room she enters, is there.	Dakin ta shiga, yana nan.
He did not feel any happiness.	Bai ji wani farin ciki ba.
This is interesting.	Wannan yana da ban sha'awa.
We have some work to do with this person.	Muna da wani aiki da za mu yi da wannan mutumin.
I don't like anyone.	Ba na son kowa.
I would never like it, you will see it for yourself.	Ba zan taɓa so ba, za ku ga hakan da kanku.
So he put it.	Haka ya saka.
And they saw a lot of things happening.	Kuma sun ga abubuwa da yawa suna faruwa.
He is now dead.	Yanzu ya mutu.
Wait for this answer.	Ku jira wannan amsa.
And so we know that participate.	Kuma haka muka san cewa shiga.
You will never let him go.	Ba za ku taɓa barin shi ya tafi ba.
They have no idea what they are saying.	Ba su da wani tunani game da abin da suke faɗa.
We have no food or water.	Ba mu da abinci ko ruwa.
This is going to be a whole new thing.	Wannan zai zama sabon sabon abu.
In fact, it didn’t take as much as you might think.	A gaskiya, bai ɗauki mai yawa kamar yadda kuke tunani ba.
Or through us.	Ko ta hanyar mu.
That's just it.	Wannan shine kawai.
He looked where he stood.	Ya kalli inda ya tsaya.
I no longer believe that.	Ban ƙara yarda da hakan ba.
This is a difficult task.	Wannan aiki ne mai wahala.
That you do not know what you know.	Cewa ba ku san abin da kuka sani ba.
He should return home.	Ya kamata ya koma gida.
Is that so.	Shin haka ne.
Of course not.	Lallai ba mu yi ba.
She did not know what to say to him.	Bata san me zata ce masa ba.
You were not right about it at the time.	Ba ku da gaskiya a kai a lokacin.
There is nothing we want.	Babu wani abu da muke so.
But not at the time.	Amma ba a lokacin ba.
Will it rain tomorrow?	Za a yi ruwan sama gobe?
Time passed quickly.	Lokaci ya wuce da sauri.
But nothing led to it.	Amma babu abin da ya kai shi.
And surprisingly, she was killed.	Kuma mamaki, an kashe ta.
I want to help you get well.	Ina so in taimake ka ka samu lafiya.
Maybe there is something about that.	Wataƙila akwai wani abu game da hakan.
It is beyond you.	Ya wuce ku.
But they can't.	Amma ba za su iya ba.
Otherwise there is a problem.	In ba haka ba an sami matsala.
But then, she too.	Amma sai, ita ma.
They all waited.	Duk suka jira.
Remember to think of exactly when you want to turn this off.	Ka tuna tunanin lokacin da daidai kuke son kashe wannan.
He could not do anything.	Ya kasa yin komai.
They are provided by.	Ana ba da su ta .
Great job or bad job ?.	Babban aiki ko mummunan aiki?.
In fact, there are not many, many things.	A gaskiya ma, babu abubuwa da yawa da yawa.
There is no place to go.	Babu wurin da za a koma.
He really enjoyed it.	Ya ji daɗi sosai.
He did not want to think about such things again.	Ba ya so ya sake yin tunani a kan abubuwa irin wannan.
The name of this project.	Sunan wannan aikin.
They only care if you are weak.	Suna kula kawai idan kuna da rauni.
It is indeed very difficult.	Lallai yana da wahala sosai.
I was really.	Na kasance sosai.
We are not looking for this.	Ba mu neman wannan.
There is only one job.	Akwai kawai aiki daya.
We are all single.	Mu duka ba mu da aure.
Talking is hard.	Magana yana da wuya.
It will be the same if one wins.	Zai zama daidai da idan mutum ya ci nasara.
But it is not true.	Amma ba gaskiya bane.
Just funny !.	Abin ban dariya kawai!.
Many returned, and he killed them.	Da yawa suka dawo, ya kashe su.
But there is interest there too.	Amma akwai sha'awa a can ma.
She said nothing, to me.	Ba ta ce komai ba, a gare ni.
I love you	Ina son ku
We are in the world with it.	Muna cikin duniya da ita.
I love them all.	Ina son su gaba ɗaya.
So try it.	Don haka gwada shi.
I'm not serious.	Ba ni da gaske.
The conference room is full.	An cika dakin taron.
I did more than that.	Na yi fiye da haka.
I like school	Ina son makaranta
Only paid.	Abin da aka biya ne kawai.
But you can help us to succeed.	Amma kuna iya taimaka mana mu ci nasara.
They are definitely better than they were a week ago.	Tabbas sun fi yadda suka kasance mako guda da ya wuce.
Things will stop.	Abubuwa za su tsaya.
All of you, come this way.	Duk ku, ku zo ta wannan hanyar.
Happiness such as she never knew filled her completely.	Farin ciki irin wanda bata taba sani ba ya cika ta gaba daya.
I see every sign, you know.	Ina ganin kowace alama, ka sani.
After all, he was on his own.	Bayan haka, ya kasance a kan kansa.
I'm still not good enough.	Har yanzu ban isa ba.
Nice to meet you.	Na yi farin cikin ganin ku.
Do not be afraid of me.	Kada ka ji tsoro a gare ni.
That is why we are here tonight.	Wannan shine dalilin da ya sa muke nan a daren yau.
It is coming to an end.	Yana zuwa ƙarshe.
Not surprisingly.	Ba abin mamaki ba ne.
This is beyond him.	Wannan ya wuce shi.
They soon forgot.	Da sauri suka manta.
The water level is huge and impressive.	Ruwan ruwa yana da girma kuma yana da ban sha'awa.
He will get there.	Zai isa can.
We are all one.	Mu duka daya ne.
It will come to me.	Zai zo gare ni.
You want to join the project.	Kuna son shiga aikin.
It could happen again.	Yana iya sake faruwa.
She grew up.	Ta yi girma.
Be very careful.	Yi hankali sosai.
So he went on.	Don haka ya ci gaba.
Growth took place.	Girma ya faru.
There is no way to do it.	Babu wata hanya da ke yi.
This program is working.	Wannan shirin yana aiki.
More than she wants.	Fiye da yadda take so.
I want to.	Ina so in yi.
Everyone has it.	Kowa na da shi.
This is coming to me.	Wannan yana zuwa gare ni.
They are children.	Yara ne.
That would not have happened.	Da ma hakan bai faru ba.
She thought of everything she would enjoy.	Ta yi tunanin duk abin da za ta ji daɗi.
If it rains, you can't go.	Idan ana ruwa, ba za ku je ba.
And they will not make fun of you.	Kuma ba za su yi muku wasa da wahala ba.
No need to look up.	Ba a buƙatar duba sama.
It's too hot.	Zafi daya ne.
One thing is for sure.	Abu ɗaya daidai.
Anyone who does that to me.	Duk wanda yayi min haka.
So, in the end, they stopped.	Don haka, a ƙarshe, sun daina.
I am at home	Ina gida
But you will take it.	Amma za ku dauka.
It is the reason we can do that.	Ita ce dalilin da za mu iya yin hakan.
But it seems the project is not working well right now.	Amma da alama aikin ba ya aiki sosai a yanzu.
That is your job.	Aikin ku kenan.
There is one thing they have achieved, however.	Akwai abu daya da suka samu, duk da haka.
I'm a little worried.	Na dan damu.
He rose to success.	Ya tashi ya zama nasara.
That didn't say anything to him.	Wannan bai ce masa komai ba.
It's really a game to watch this cold season.	Wasan gaske ne don kallon wannan lokacin sanyi.
They fell on each other.	Suka fada kan juna.
He could recognize them.	Ya iya gane su.
John didn't even wait for me to ask him.	John bai ko jira in tambaye shi ba.
I will give you some money.	Zan yi muku kuɗi kaɗan.
It might interest me and you too.	Yana iya sha'awar ni da ku ma watakila.
She didn't like him there.	Ba ta son shi a wurin.
You are tired.	Kun gaji.
I'll work and you go to school.	Zan yi aiki kuma ku tafi makaranta.
And so I did.	Kuma haka na yi.
Let the police take care of this.	Bari 'yan sanda su kula da wannan.
She could not walk during the day.	Ba ta iya tafiya da rana.
Had he been.	Da ya kasance.
Some have time.	Wasu suna da lokaci.
But he knew nothing.	Amma bai san komai ba.
That’s why it was my favorite.	Shi ya sa ya kasance na fi so.
Do not say so.	Kar a ce haka.
Feel free.	Ji da sauri.
Maybe she got it.	Watakila ta samu.
And, they seem to be doing it again.	Kuma, da alama suna sake yin hakan.
It's a good game.	Yana da kyau wasa.
But if so, she did not give up.	Amma idan haka ne, ba ta bari ba.
They do this seems a little problematic.	Sun yi wannan da alama kadan matsala.
Here's how it works.	Ga yadda abin yake.
It is, but it is not yet.	Yana da, amma duk da haka ba haka ba.
I will not hurt you.	Ba zan yi muku rauni ba.
It's too late now.	Ya makara don haka yanzu.
God, feel good.	Allah, ya ji dadi.
You have to make an effort.	Dole ne ku yi ƙoƙari.
You are doing the right thing.	Kuna yin abin da ya dace.
We are together.	Muna tare.
That just won't work.	Wannan kawai ba zai yi aiki ba.
The thought surprised him.	Tunani ya bata mamaki.
People are not like that.	Mutane ba irin wannan ba.
That made me laugh.	Wannan har ya bani dariya.
Everything will be fine after this weekend.	Komai zai yi kyau bayan wannan karshen mako.
I fixed the problem.	Na gyara matsalar.
As you would do at home.	Kamar yadda za ku yi a gida.
If you want to leave it at that, it's fine.	Idan kana so ka bar shi a haka, yana da kyau.
Do not wait near me.	Kada ku jira a kusa da ni.
He would be surprised if he was honest.	Zai yi mamaki idan ya yi gaskiya.
She can only see now.	Ta iya gani kawai yanzu.
She looked around the room.	Ta kalli dakin.
I'm a little tired and I don't feel very well.	Na dan gaji kuma ba na jin dadi sosai.
He did not even say that she was the one who killed him.	Bai ma ce ita ce ta kashe shi ba.
It was scary.	Ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
But no one appeared.	Amma babu wanda ya bayyana.
He is less than a year old.	Bai cika shekara ba.
You need to cover this weakness.	Kuna buƙatar rufe wannan rauni.
Seeing this made it cold.	Ganin haka yasa shi sanyi.
You do not have to go out.	Ba dole ba ne ka fita.
They will continue to move forward.	Za su ci gaba da ci gaba.
We can help each other but little.	Za mu iya taimakon juna amma kaɗan.
What does she do.	Me take yi.
I do not want to know.	Ba na son sani.
He did not know she was pregnant.	Bai san tana da ciki ba.
This is not like you.	Wannan ba kamar ku ba ne.
But she will remember all this.	Amma za ta tuna duk wannan.
Others do not.	Wasu kuma ba.
And it was good.	Kuma ya yi kyau.
He knows them all.	Ya san su duka.
I told him thirty.	Na ce masa talatin.
But you made it a song.	Amma kun sanya shi waƙa.
She can't tell anyone how she feels.	Ba za ta iya gaya wa kowa yadda take ji ba.
So I did.	Don haka na yi.
Surprisingly I do not know what causes this.	Abin mamaki ban san me ke kawo hakan ba.
He did not try to agree.	Bai yi ƙoƙarin yarda ba.
I would be happy to do it this way.	Zan yi farin cikin yin hakan ta wannan hanya.
All of the above are good.	Duk abubuwan da ke sama suna da kyau.
No one will agree to know what happened.	Babu wanda zai yarda da sanin abin da ya faru.
We have not tried that yet.	Ba mu gwada hakan ba tukuna.
She will do well.	Za ta yi kyau.
He will let you join us.	Zai bar ku ku shiga mu.
It does not require any work to work.	Ba ya buƙatar wani aiki don yin aiki.
He recognized the man.	Ya gane mutumin.
This is not fair.	Wannan bai dace ba.
I hope you can help.	Ina fata za ku iya taimaka.
That's what he heard.	Abin da ya ji kenan.
But that night he is very happy.	Amma a wannan dare ya yi farin ciki sosai.
He sat and waited.	Ya zauna ya jira.
Surprisingly they were.	Abin mamaki sun kasance.
So far everything is working fine.	Ya zuwa yanzu komai yana aiki lafiya.
This is what it looks like most of the time.	Wannan shi ne abin da yake kama da shi mafi yawan lokaci.
I still do not know how.	Har yanzu ban san ta yaya ba.
Many people are upset.	Mutane da yawa sun damu.
They did.	Sun yi .
I took some time there.	Na dan dauki lokaci a can.
And we were able to fight.	Kuma mun sami damar fada.
Nothing happened here.	Babu abin da ya faru a nan.
One more month.	Wata daya babu kuma.
Yet it appears.	Amma duk da haka yana bayyana.
Now look at what you did.	Yanzu duba abin da kuka yi.
They were smart, but not that.	Sun kasance masu hankali, amma ba wannan ba.
I can do that.	Hakan na iya yi.
Rejoice in it.	Yi farin ciki a ciki.
Do not let fake things happen.	Kar ka bar abubuwa na karya.
This is not a joke.	Wannan ba wani abin dariya ba ne.
Play simple.	Yi wasa mai sauƙi.
It will not take much.	Ba zai ɗauki yawa ba.
I apologize for the inconvenience.	Na yi hakuri da abin da kuke ciki.
You work hard.	Kuna aiki sosai.
Now you know more about this phenomenon.	Yanzu kun san fiye da wannan sabon abu.
She cannot be thirty years old.	Ba za ta iya kai shekara talatin ba.
Maybe that's fine.	Wataƙila hakan yayi kyau.
He did not care.	Bai damu ba.
I am from here.	Ina daga nan.
There is something, though.	Akwai wani abu, ko da yake.
I am not the only one who has been through this.	Ba ni kadai ne wannan ya faru da shi ba.
Child's name.	Sunan yaro.
Maybe he wants something better for you than he has.	Wataƙila ya so wani abu mafi kyau a gare ku fiye da yadda yake da shi.
They seem to have no money at all.	Kamar ba su da kudi ko kadan.
Swim with them.	Ka yi iyo tare da su.
Hope to have it.	Da fatan za a kasance da shi.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
I looked back	Na kalli baya
Go! 	Ku tafi!
He said.	Yace.
But he has such an interest.	Amma yana da irin wannan sha'awa.
He just doesn't want to hear the truth.	Kamar baya son jin gaskiya.
It feels like me.	Yana ji kamar ni.
Sometimes he is answered with the same kind of response.	Wani lokaci ana amsa masa da irin amsa.
Not that it should be, but it did.	Ba cewa ya kamata ya kasance ba, amma ya yi.
Talk to someone.	Yi magana da wani.
They will not take it.	Ba za su dauka ba.
He should drive fast.	Ya kamata ya tuƙi da sauri.
It was a busy week.	Ya kasance mako mai aiki.
A little late.	A ɗan makara.
But it is a good film.	Amma fim ne mai kyau.
So he decided to play with them.	Don haka ya yanke shawarar ya yi ɗan wasa da su.
I am convinced that it is true.	Na tabbatar da cewa gaskiya ne.
Now it's time to ask a few questions.	Yanzu lokaci ya yi da zan tambayi kaɗan.
The man was right.	Mutumin yayi gaskiya.
Now for the surprise.	Yanzu ga abin mamaki.
I didn’t think it would be that way.	Ban yi tsammanin zai kasance haka ba.
What he knows is the truth.	Abin da ya sani shi ne gaskiya ne.
Long time no see.	Mun dade da ganin juna.
I am not interested in them.	Ba ni da sha'awar su.
That is not why you are in it.	Ba shine dalilin da ya sa kuke ciki ba.
They can’t make money anyway.	Ba za su iya samun kuɗi ta wata hanya ba.
No problem at all.	Ba matsala ko kadan.
You can not live with them.	Ba za ku iya zama tare da su ba.
I want to start preparing them.	Ina so in fara shirya su.
I feel comfortable and enjoy talking to people.	Ina jin dadi kuma ina jin daɗin magana da mutane.
I like this look	Ina son wannan kallon
I asked her.	Na tambaye ta.
We have no interest in the future.	Ba mu da sha'awar nan gaba.
Nothing but hardship.	Ba komai sai wahala.
But it tastes really good.	Amma yayi dadi sosai.
He wanted her to say something, though.	Ya so ta ce wani abu, ko da yake.
And thus we are a new person.	Kuma ta haka ne mu sabon mutum ne.
Just that we are.	Kawai cewa mu ne.
He loves to travel.	Yana son tafiya.
No, really, they do.	A'a, da gaske, suna yi.
So, no wonder.	Don haka, babu abin mamaki.
It just came out.	Sai da ya fito.
It's good to do.	Yana da kyau ya yi.
He has to hurry.	Dole ne ya yi sauri.
He came to me at the time.	Ya zo min a lokacin.
I still want one.	Har yanzu ina son daya.
You only get one life.	Kuna samun rayuwa ɗaya kawai.
I told you before.	Na fada maka a baya.
You can do better than me.	Za ku iya mafi kyau da ni.
This is a wedding.	Wannan bikin aure ne.
This is a surprise.	Wannan abin mamaki ne.
I can only see from above.	Ina iya gani daga sama kawai.
I could not understand what the problem might be.	Na kasa gane menene matsalar zata iya zama.
But it was too cold for me to stay here with you.	Amma yana da sanyi sosai don in zauna a nan tare da ku.
I do it all the time.	Ina yin shi kullum.
Let's talk about it.	Mu yi magana da shi.
He put the work into it.	Ya saka aikin a ciki.
He would never do such a thing.	Ba zai taɓa yin irin wannan abu ba.
And break.	Da kuma karya.
But things are not going well at home.	Amma abubuwa ba su da kyau a gida.
He does nothing.	Ba ya yin komai.
The money to start and take care of yourself.	Kuɗin da za a fara da kuma kula da kansa.
They were arrested.	An kama su.
Call them by their first name.	Kira su da suna.
And we found that it was growing.	Kuma mun sami cewa yana girma.
I like these things.	Ina son waɗannan abubuwa.
They ate lunch together.	Sun ci abincin rana tare.
After that, he left.	Bayan haka, ya tafi.
We must get help.	Dole ne mu sami taimako.
It seems there is always more to know.	Da alama ko da yaushe akwai ƙarin sani.
It happened.	Ya faru.
Basically, the house was a success.	Ainihin, gidan ya yi nasara.
Although nothing.	Ko da yake ba komai.
But he lost his temper.	Amma ya rasa yadda zai yi.
They have never heard of such a thing.	Ba su taba jin irin wannan abu ba.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
They will not trust you until you speak.	Ba za su yarda da ku ba sai kun yi magana.
This is what you are here to do.	Wannan shine abin da kuke nan don yin.
I can tell you by the way some food is gone.	Zan iya gaya muku ta hanyar wasu abinci sun tafi.
But it keeps coming.	Amma yana ci gaba da zuwa.
I can not save them.	Ba zan iya ajiye su ba.
At first she hated him.	Tun da farko ta ƙi shi.
And they were checked later.	Kuma aka duba su daga baya.
It's hard.	Yana da wuya.
I think they should all win.	Ina ganin ya kamata su yi nasara duka.
Not if you are looking for pleasure.	Ba idan kuna neman jin daɗi ba.
They are close to each other.	Suna kusa da juna.
I will never do anything.	Ba zan taba yin wani abu ba.
No one is looking for that.	Babu wanda ke neman hakan.
Things come true.	Abubuwan da suka zo gaskiya.
He ran at a great speed.	Ya yi gaba da gudu mai girma.
We would never have known that.	Da ba mu taɓa sanin wannan ba.
I enjoyed tonight.	Na ji daɗin daren yau.
We want to change the world.	Muna so mu canza duniya.
He spoke again.	Ya sake magana.
It can be this way or that way.	Yana iya zama ta wannan hanya ko ta wannan hanya.
Leave the metal.	Bar karfe.
She appeared almost completely.	Ta bayyana kusan gaba daya.
I was not informed.	Ba a ba ni labarin ba.
Good on the water too.	Yayi kyau akan ruwa kuma.
But we need help.	Amma muna buƙatar samun taimako.
The meeting was unsuccessful.	Taron bai yi nasara ba.
I think you have met him before.	Ina tsammanin kun hadu da shi a baya.
This is something that will not be forgotten.	Wannan wani abu ne da ba za a manta ba.
Of course it is good to hear from you.	Tabbas yana da kyau a ji daga gare ku.
Get up from here.	Tashi daga nan.
Be honest with yourself.	Ku kasance masu gaskiya da yadda kuke ji.
We can still find each other.	Har yanzu muna iya samun juna.
But the meeting never took place.	Amma taron bai taba faruwa ba.
She prefers fish.	Ta fi son kifi.
The latter is as difficult as the first is simple.	Na karshen yana da wahala kamar yadda na farko ya kasance mai sauƙi.
So it was decided not to use it.	Don haka aka yanke shawarar kada a yi amfani da shi.
So she waited.	Da haka ta jira.
He never.	Ya taba.
She thought she knew what to expect next.	Ta yi tunanin ta san abin da zai sa gaba.
Not here, not for her.	Ba a nan ba, ba don ita ba.
Should take advantage of growth opportunities.	Kamata yayi yayi amfani da damar girma.
She needs it.	Tana bukata.
They did not reach heaven.	Ba su isa sama ba.
There is little we can do about it now.	Akwai kadan da za mu iya yi game da hakan a yanzu.
It is not enough.	Bai isa ba.
It is not very close to the room.	Ba ya kusa da dakin sosai.
But not really.	Amma ba yadda yake da gaske ba.
The man will not even test her.	Mutumin ma ba zai gwada mata ba.
They will take care of it.	Za su kula da shi.
Things are not easy.	Abubuwa ba su da sauƙi.
The attention has shifted.	Hankali ya koma baya.
Surprisingly, he was left there.	Abin ban mamaki shi ne an bar shi a can.
And you, you are very useful.	Kuma kai, kana da amfani sosai.
This is all happening fast.	Wannan duk yana faruwa da sauri.
Or it may be empty.	Ko kuma yana iya zama ba komai.
We did it.	Mun yi shi.
It's not easy, he admits.	Ba shi da sauƙi, ya yarda.
Time is everything in life.	Lokaci shine komai a rayuwa.
It seemed to fly.	Kamar ta tashi sama.
Not a success.	Ba nasara ba.
In the end, he failed.	A ƙarshe, ya kasa.
It was not enough to kill her.	Bai isa ya kashe ta ba.
You said that could not happen.	Kun ce hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
She is convinced of that.	Ta tabbata da hakan.
Add water to it.	Ƙara ruwa zuwa gare shi.
If only we had known then.	Da a ce mun san shi a lokacin.
She drank a lot of coffee.	Ta sha kofi da yawa.
You look sick.	Ka ga kamar baka da lafiya.
Where do you come from?	Daga ina ka fito?
When you are successful, say nothing.	Lokacin da kuka yi nasara, kada ku ce komai.
That in itself would be difficult.	Shi kansa hakan zai yi wahala.
No, it can happen to anyone.	A'a, yana iya faruwa ga kowa.
A lot can happen at the time.	Da yawa na iya faruwa a lokacin.
Slightly, nothing.	Dan kadan, ba komai.
Good on you.	Yayi muku kyau.
He never thought like that.	Bai taba yin irin wannan tunani ba.
We need to fix this.	Muna bukatar gyara wannan.
Otherwise, you will get tired.	In ba haka ba, za ku gaji.
I kept them in the back door.	Na ajiye su a kofar baya.
But it didn't mean anything to him.	Amma bata ce masa komai ba.
No one is alive.	Babu wani mai rai.
One may like one’s work or not.	Mutum na iya son aikin mutum ko a'a.
And yet for you.	Kuma duk da haka ga ku.
It's too late, he knows.	Ya makara, ya sani.
We are very comfortable.	Muna da dadi sosai.
I don't feel like doing anything.	Ba na jin yin komai.
So enough, fine.	Don haka isa, lafiya.
She told me she was scared.	Ta fada min tana jin tsoro.
Make this!	Sanya wannan!
They are all gone.	Duk sun tafi.
There was something she did not hear.	Akwai abin da ba ta ji ba.
I am honest with no one to hear it.	Ni gaskiya ba tare da wanda zai ji ta ba.
I really like this book.	Ina matukar son wannan littafin.
It can no longer be done.	Ba za a iya yin hakan ba kuma.
I was sent.	An aika nawa.
She would have been left alone.	Da an bar ta ita kadai.
She is coming home.	Tana zuwa gida.
They will imitate each other as children do.	Za su yi koyi da juna kamar yadda yara suke yi.
This is hard to cut.	Wannan ke da wuya a yanke.
Not true.	Ba gaskiya bane.
This is a delicious meal.	Wannan abinci ne mai daɗi.
We will be there.	Za mu kasance a can.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
Any help would be very helpful.	Duk wani taimako zai kasance da amfani sosai.
Keep playing.	Ci gaba da ci gaba da wasa.
He did not know how long he had been standing there.	Bai san tsawon lokacin da ya tsaya a wurin ba.
He went to do it.	Ya je ya yi.
A little sad.	Dan bakin ciki.
It worked really well.	Yayi aiki da kyau sosai.
I have to check.	Dole na duba.
Or see.	Ko gani.
They will look the other way.	Za su kalli wata hanya.
The police checked it out.	'Yan sanda sun duba hakan.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lokaci ya yi don ganin ainihin abin da ke faruwa.
He did not let me help him.	Bai bar ni in taimake shi ba.
Nor can he.	Haka kuma ba zai iya ba.
The place is nice.	Wuri yayi kyau.
It comes to me.	Yana zuwa gare ni.
Sorry about that!	Yi hakuri da hakan!.
You can move as fast or slowly as you like.	Kuna iya tafiya cikin sauri ko a hankali yadda kuke so.
I thought about that.	Na yi tunani game da wannan.
There is so much to see.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a gani.
In fact, I am not married.	A gaskiya ma ban yi aure ba.
You have nothing to lose.	Ba ku rasa komai.
Everything is fine so far.	Komai yana da kyau ya zuwa yanzu.
I think they love each other.	Ina tsammanin suna son juna.
I will be back in two days.	Zan dawo nan da kwana biyu.
Have a life, you will!	Samun rayuwa, za ku!
I was here.	Na kasance a nan.
This is not the case.	Wannan ba haka yake ba.
Maybe he already has one.	Wataƙila ya riga yana da ɗaya.
There is no child.	Babu wani yaro.
Maybe there is something we can do.	Wataƙila akwai abin da za mu iya yi.
We should ask this.	Ya kamata mu tambayi wannan.
So you can't take that.	Don haka ba za ku iya ɗauka haka ba.
He decided to let her pass.	Ya yanke shawarar bari ta wuce.
It's starting to rain now.	An fara yin ruwan sama a yanzu.
The police cannot protect you.	'Yan sanda ba za su iya kare ku ba.
I understand why they would feel that way.	Na fahimci dalilin da yasa za su ji haka.
Secondly, it does not work.	Na biyu kuma, ba ya aiki.
Send everyone home or the day.	Aika kowa gida ko ranar.
It rained slowly throughout the morning.	An yi ruwan sama a hankali duk da safe.
He did not think.	Bai yi tunani ba.
I did everything.	Na yi komai.
He will never love you.	Ba zai taba son ku ba.
Living room is the best place to do this.	Gidan zama shine mafi kyawun wuri don yin wannan.
And just in time too.	Kuma kawai cikin lokaci ma.
Stop lying to the world about what's going on.	A daina yi wa duniya karya game da abin da ke faruwa.
I think you should not be here.	Ina tsammanin bai kamata ku kasance a nan ba.
Eat one and move on.	Ka ci daya ka ci gaba.
In increasing illness.	A cikin ƙara rashin lafiya.
They do it because the work needs it.	Suna yin shi saboda aikin yana buƙatar shi.
It's scary.	Yana da ban tsoro.
Some people were left alone at night.	An bar wasu mutane ne kawai cikin dare.
She started one lie, then another.	Ta fara wata karya, sai wata.
And he said so.	Kuma ya ce haka.
I'm not sure it will happen.	Ban tabbata ba zai faru.
As of now it will be later.	Kamar yadda na yanzu zai kasance daga baya.
By now she must have died too.	Zuwa yanzu tabbas ita ma ta mutu.
Truth is not intelligence.	Gaskiya ba hankali ba ne.
I do now, and it is a great help.	Ina yi yanzu, kuma babban taimako ne.
We were happy together.	Mun yi farin ciki tare.
I just touched it inside.	Kawai na taba shi a ciki.
Such a world view.	Irin wannan kallon duniya.
You have to do everything.	Dole ne ku yi komai.
So they were not.	Don haka ba su kasance ba.
The water is not very fast.	Ruwa ba shi da sauri sosai.
Good thing too.	Abu mai kyau kuma.
I could not figure out who it was.	Na kasa gane ko wanene.
It does a great job.	Yana yin babban aiki.
He already knew that.	Tun farko ya san haka.
I am happier now.	Na fi farin ciki yanzu.
Nothing will surprise me.	Ba abin da zai ba ni mamaki.
Before she died.	Kafin ta mutu.
But we know they don't.	Amma mun san ba su da.
He came while we were doing this.	Ya zo ne a lokacin da muke yin haka.
What we were was not right.	Abin da muka kasance bai dace ba.
It's nothing.	Ba wani abu ba.
Need to know.	Bukatar sani.
I do not go to school.	Ba na makaranta.
I'm glad to know you're on these things.	Na yi farin cikin sanin kuna kan waɗannan abubuwan.
It was from there that the fun continued.	Daga nan ne aka ci gaba da jin dadi.
They assured him of that.	Suka tabbatar masa da hakan.
This is just that.	Wannan shi ne kawai.
I have a car	Ina da mota
This is a true statement.	Wannan magana ce ta gaskiya.
And good too.	Kuma mai kyau ma.
I remember the time very well.	Na tuna da lokacin sosai.
One person remembers.	Mutum daya ya tuna.
Anyone can join.	Kowa na iya yin hannu.
He said nothing.	Bai ce komai ba.
The world would be a much better place if we did.	Duniya za ta zama wuri mafi kyau idan muka yi.
I know how it gets.	Na san yadda yake samun.
But still refuse.	Amma har yanzu ƙi.
And so on.	Da sauran su.
Not even for a day.	Ba ko kwana daya ba.
It used to be a problem.	A da ya kasance matsala.
You have to be better.	Dole ne ku fi kyau.
So you can do whatever you want with this.	Don haka za ku iya yin abin da kuke so da wannan.
Though not here or there, it is very surprising.	Ko da yake ba a nan ko a can ba, yana da ban mamaki sosai.
It's nothing.	Ba komai ba ne.
I am tired	Na gaji
Sorry about that.	Ku yi hakuri da mu.
He had to pay attention.	Sai da ya kula.
Keep it simple and easy.	Ci gaba da sauƙi da sauƙi.
He has been involved with many people since the beginning.	Ya shiga cikin mutane da yawa tun daga farko.
Looks around everyone.	Kama a kusa da kowane.
Travel in time.	Tafiya cikin lokaci.
It bothers me.	Ya damu ni.
Had they been in time.	Da sun kasance cikin lokaci.
I work hard.	Ina aiki sosai.
I called one earlier.	Na kira daya a baya.
Lots of things.	Abubuwa da yawa.
Tomorrow will be better.	Gobe ​​zai yi kyau.
People were more likely to smoke at the time.	Mutane sun fi shan taba a lokacin.
Something went up.	Wani abu ya tashi.
This is the same time.	Wannan lokaci ɗaya ne.
But we really don't need to be told.	Amma da gaske ba ma bukatar a gaya mana.
We are eating well now.	Muna ci da kyau yanzu.
I do not have to love you.	Ba sai na so ku ba.
Maybe they stood outside, or they stood inside.	Watakila sun tsaya waje, ko kuma sun tsaya a ciki.
No one will be seen.	Babu wanda za a gani.
Check it out if you have the opportunity.	Duba shi idan kun sami dama.
And it does more than that.	Kuma ya fi yin hakan.
She also heard.	Ita ma ta ji.
He kept walking.	Ya ci gaba da tafiya.
I’m done with it now, though.	Na gama da shi yanzu, ko da yake.
Each time it brings a new surprise.	Kowane lokaci ya kawo sabon abin mamaki.
Had she known what she was missing.	Da ta san me ta rasa.
We are having a good time.	Muna yin lokaci mai kyau.
I took the time to eat.	Na dauki lokaci na ci.
No one has ever given me as much as you.	Babu wanda ya taba bani yawa kamar ku.
Or someone you know.	Ko kuma wanda ka sani.
People even ask you to explain it.	Har ma mutane sun nemi ka bayyana hakan.
He felt strange.	Ya ji abin ban mamaki.
He feels calm.	Yana jin a hankali.
Be that as it may.	Ku kasance haka.
Good luck !.	Yi kyau!.
I'll have my coffee early.	Zan sha kofi na da wuri.
I'm not just talking.	Ba ina magana kawai ba.
Why would he not.	Me ya sa ba zai yi ba.
I don’t feel we will ever.	Ba na jin za mu taba.
Of course it works nearby.	Tabbas yana aiki a kusa da nan.
After two days he could not go to school.	Bayan kwana biyu bai iya zuwa makaranta ba.
For them, we apologize, and just say that.	A gare su, muna ba da hakuri, kuma mu ce kawai wannan.
They are the best she has ever been.	Sun fi kowace irin kyau da ta taɓa yi.
They take good care of me.	Suna kula da ni lafiya.
I could not recognize him.	Ba zan iya gane shi ba.
We found no reading.	Mun gano babu karatu.
It's not an easy game for me.	Ba wasa ba ne mai sauƙi a gare ni.
This is not.	Wannan ba.
How long will it take to do this anyway.	Yaya tsawon lokacin da za a ɗauka don yin hakan ta wata hanya.
I want to see it that way.	Ina son ganin shi haka.
It should not be a problem.	Ya kamata ba matsala.
This is one.	Wannan daya ne.
That's what we have.	Abin da muke da shi ke nan.
There is nothing interesting here.	Babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa a nan.
That will not change.	Wannan ba zai canza ba.
No one else, in fact.	Babu wani kuma, a gaskiya.
If you paid them, they would come back later for more.	Idan ka biya su, da sun dawo daga baya don ƙarin.
Either way, we will do this again.	Ko ta yaya, za mu sake yin wannan.
He walks to the front door.	Yana tafiya har kofar gida.
People must stop doing that.	Dole ne mutane su daina yin hakan.
It is time for someone to know.	Lokaci ya yi da wani ya sani.
You are not honest, you are not good.	Ba ka da gaskiya, ba ka da kyau.
I asked her if she knew you and she said she did.	Na tambaye ta ko ta san ku sai ta ce ta yi.
I want to talk to you about that.	Ina so in yi magana da ku akan hakan.
No one else at the time.	Babu wani kuma a lokacin.
He quickly opened the door.	Da sauri ya bude kofar.
She didn't think he would accept it.	Bata yi tsammanin zai yarda da ita ba.
Everything appears to be going well.	Komai ya bayyana yana tafiya lafiya.
There is police work to be done.	Akwai aikin 'yan sanda da za a yi.
These items cannot be eaten.	Ba za a iya ci waɗannan abubuwan ba.
It may be true.	Yana iya zama gaskiya.
Everyone knows you.	Kowa ya san ku.
And so on.	Da sauran su.
But two things went wrong.	Amma abubuwa biyu sun yi kuskure.
However, it later became clear that this was not the case.	Duk da haka, daga baya ya bayyana cewa ba gaskiya bane.
Talk about them.	Yi magana game da su.
You told me a little bit.	Kun gaya mani kadan.
She was smart there.	Ta kasance mai hankali a can.
Then she waited and waited for them to return.	Sai ta jira ta jira su dawo.
He knows why he is doing it.	Ya san dalilin da ya sa yake yin haka.
He has to be careful here.	Dole ne ya yi hankali a nan.
We are very sad.	Mun yi bakin ciki sosai.
I speak the truth.	Gaskiya nake magana.
He wanted to know what was going on.	Ya so ya san abin da ke faruwa.
Not a role model.	Ba abin koyi ba.
We talked to each other.	Mun yi magana da juna.
And she is right.	Kuma tabbas tana da gaskiya.
It must have been very nice though.	Dole ne ya kasance da kyau sosai ko da yake.
It wasn’t what she wanted, but she would do it for the time being.	Ba abin da take so ba ne, amma zai yi don lokacin.
It is assumed.	Ana ɗauka.
We did it to do it.	Mun yi shi ne don yin shi.
They have your name, he said.	Suna da sunan ku, in ji shi.
You think so.	Kuna tsammanin hakan.
Two things may appear.	Abubuwa biyu na iya bayyana.
I will not return.	Ba zan dawo ba.
This has been the case since childhood.	Haka ya kasance tun suna yara.
Let's eat there tonight.	Mu ci a can daren yau.
However, one thing happened to another and we got married.	Duk da haka, wani abu ya kai ga wani kuma muka yi aure.
Don't worry too much.	Kar ka damu sosai.
I call this missed opportunity.	Na kira wannan damar da aka rasa.
They brought it to me.	Suka kawo min shi.
I heard about you.	Na ji labarin ku.
The living do not talk much, the speakers do not work.	Masu rai ba su yawan magana, masu magana ba sa aiki.
But it is not enough just to get it back.	Amma bai isa kawai a dawo da shi ba.
Not as we know it.	Ba kamar yadda muka sani ba.
But it can happen, as described.	Amma yana iya faruwa, kamar yadda aka bayyana.
Turn it off.	Kashe shi.
This has changed over time.	Wannan ya canza bayan lokaci.
Overall he got a run.	Gaba ɗaya ya samu gudu.
Money can get you really good.	Kudi na iya samun ku sosai.
Maybe he has no idea who you are.	Wataƙila ba shi da wani tunanin ko kai wanene.
You can see we are very happy.	Kuna iya ganin muna jin daɗi sosai.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
It went almost as soon as we did.	Ya tafi kusan lokacin da muka yi.
You want to help but you can't.	Kuna so ku taimaka amma ba za ku iya ba.
You are great.	Kai mai girma ne.
Run, stay alive, catch the money.	Gudu, zauna da rai, kama kuɗin.
It has not been released here.	Ba a sake shi nan ba.
We returned home.	Mun koma gida.
He was seriously injured.	Ya yi mummunan rauni.
To do this work, people must be.	Don yin wannan aiki, dole ne mutane su kasance.
It is the reason one dies.	Ita ce dalilin daya mutu.
There is no need to make a mistake.	Ba sai an yi kuskure ba.
Two people were killed.	An kashe mutane biyu.
How hot is the water?	Yaya zafi ne ruwan?
I don't care about that.	Ban damu da wannan ba.
It will stop.	Zai tsaya.
This can be a terrible thing.	Wannan na iya zama mummunan abu.
It’s hard about what’s really right or wrong.	Yana da wuya game da abin da ke ainihin daidai ko kuskure.
You will not hear this.	Ba za ku ji wannan ba.
I knew she could not.	Na san ba za ta iya ba.
It seems that nothing happened.	Da alama babu wani abu da ya faru.
We will continue to live in fear.	Za mu ci gaba da rayuwa cikin tsoro.
And yes, that sounds weird.	Kuma a, wannan yana jin ban mamaki.
You want to.	Kana so ka.
He wanted to remember everything about that moment.	Ya so ya tuna komai game da wannan lokacin.
But that should grow over time.	Amma hakan ya kamata ya girma akan lokaci.
It just makes me realize how fast time is moving.	Yana kawai sa ni gane yadda sauri lokaci ke tafiya.
They were kept with him.	Aka ajiye su tare da shi.
I'm sure it will fly.	Na tabbata zai tashi.
Something you are going to do without it.	Wani abu da za ku je ku yi ba tare da ita ba.
And they recognize it.	Kuma suna gane shi.
We do not know you.	Ba mu san ku ba.
If you are not feeling well, stay home.	Idan ba ku da lafiya, zauna a gida.
They have very tasty food.	Suna da abinci mai daɗi sosai.
Leave me alone.	Ka bar ni daga ciki.
I recommend it.	Ina ba da shawarar shi.
Here is a great opportunity.	Ga dama mai girma.
Either way, she was.	A wata hanya, ta kasance.
Read it right away.	Karanta shi nan da nan.
There are some things that money cannot buy.	Akwai wasu abubuwan da kuɗi ba za su iya saya ba.
In a year, maybe two, we will forget it all.	A cikin shekara guda, watakila biyu, za mu manta da shi duka.
He studied hard.	Yayi karatu sosai.
I have to keep going.	Dole in ci gaba.
And the world is safe.	Kuma duniya tana lafiya.
I'll be back soon.	Zan dawo da wuri.
It helped a lot.	Ya taimaka sosai.
You should think about it from the beginning.	Ya kamata ku yi tunani a kan hakan tun da farko.
Some who heard the news did not agree.	Wasu da suka ji labarin, ba su yarda ba.
She did not know why she said anything.	Bata san me yasa ta ce komai ba.
He came to this.	Ya zo ga wannan.
I want to know.	Ina so in sani.
And she must tell someone.	Kuma dole ne ta gaya wa wani.
Your length	Tsawon ku
Do not let them go.	Kar a bar su su tafi.
If no one knew, no one would be hurt.	Idan babu wanda ya sani, babu wanda zai ji rauni.
I'm just surprised.	Ina mamakin kawai.
All of these things are real.	Duk waɗannan abubuwa na gaske ne.
A car veered off the road and collided.	Wata mota ta gudu daga kan hanya ta yi karo.
You only need to use it once or twice.	Kuna buƙatar amfani da shi sau ɗaya ko sau biyu kawai.
This is also easy.	Wannan ma mai sauƙi ne.
You are alone.	Kai kadai ne.
I stayed there for a while.	Na zauna a can na ɗan lokaci.
He was funny.	Ya kasance mai ban dariya.
I felt that both then and now.	Na ji haka duka a lokacin da kuma yanzu.
I want to help somehow.	Ina so in taimaka ko ta yaya.
You may have already worked on these.	Wataƙila kun riga kun yi aiki akan waɗannan.
Maybe it is good to tell someone about it.	Wataƙila yana da kyau a gaya wa wani game da shi.
But you know that will pass.	Amma kun san hakan zai wuce.
The man left.	Mutumin ya tafi.
Well come with me.	Da kyau ka zo tare da ni.
Do not look down.	Kar ka kalli kasa.
Leave me alone now.	Ka bar ni ni kadai a yanzu.
I will go there and prepare a place for you.	Zan tafi can in shirya muku wuri.
But it is not.	Amma ba haka ba.
But not there.	Amma ba a can.
You know nothing.	Ba ku san komai ba.
That was years and years.	Shekaru da shekaru kenan kenan.
There are a lot of kids about them.	Akwai yara da yawa game da su.
Everything he drank for years.	Duk abin da ya sha na tsawon shekaru.
Otherwise, it is not too late.	Ban da haka, ba a makara ba.
They can look at the house.	Suna iya kallon gidan.
The right person is comfortable.	Mutumin da ya dace yana jin daɗi.
You do it when you live on your own.	Kuna yin hakan lokacin da kuke zaune da kanku.
You should keep this in a cool place.	Ya kamata ku ajiye wannan a wuri mai sanyi.
This will happen.	Wannan zai faru.
Not true.	Ba gaskiya bane.
He grew up for me.	Ya girma a gare ni.
This is so.	Wannan haka yake.
They won.	Sun ci nasara.
After she was discovered.	Bayan an gano ta.
It can still be.	Har yanzu yana iya zama.
Then things started to go wrong.	Sai abubuwa suka fara tafiya ba daidai ba.
I have to eat.	Dole na ci abinci.
You trust me.	Kun yarda da ni.
It is little or no use.	Yana da kadan ko babu amfani.
One can never be sure of it.	Mutum ba zai taba tabbata da shi ba.
She sees no reason to be unhappy.	Ba ta ga dalilin rashin jin daɗi ba.
I have seen this before.	Na taba ganin wannan a baya.
There are so many games.	Akwai wasan da yawa.
They will get ready, they will go.	Za su shirya, za su tafi.
Let's look again.	Bari mu sake duba.
Over and over.	A kan kuma a kan.
We got it right.	Mun samu shi da kyau.
We could not get closer to it.	Ba mu iya zuwa kusa da shi ba.
But they did not want him to die.	Amma ba su so ya mutu.
Explain good weekend.	Bayyana kyakkyawan karshen mako.
Maybe I don't know how it works.	Wataƙila ban san yadda yake aiki ba.
Or, more often than not, both.	Ko, sau da yawa, duka biyu.
This is more difficult to do.	Wannan ya fi wuya a yi.
Maybe the rest of the time was spent thinking about the problem.	Wataƙila an yi amfani da sauran lokacin don tunanin matsalar.
I'm sleeping.	Ina barci.
He is a very intelligent man.	Mutum ne mai hankali.
He succeeded at first.	Ya yi nasara da farko.
Now they stand open.	Yanzu sun tsaya a bude.
He did a great job.	Ya yi babban aiki.
This will not work.	Wannan ba zai yi aiki ba.
The film is good but is forgotten.	Fim ɗin yana da kyau amma an manta da shi.
We just.	Mu kawai.
You must save the new book.	Dole ne ku ajiye sabon littafin.
We left her, as we thought, on the boat.	Muka bar ta, kamar yadda muke tunani, a kan jirgin ruwa.
We are still working.	Har yanzu muna aiki.
Sit right.	Zauna daidai.
Man, to be very good.	Mutum, don zama mai kyau sosai.
And he made a mistake.	Kuma yayi kuskure.
He used to love the book.	Ya kasance yana son littafin.
The work was awesome.	Aikin ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
I love women	Ina son mata
You say everyone starts using it.	Kun ce kowa ya fara amfani da shi.
I have no more crying.	Ba ni da sauran kuka.
There are so many.	Akwai da yawa.
.	.
She could not believe it.	Ta kasa yarda da hakan.
I'll take one.	Zan dauki daya.
Call me if you need to.	Kira ni idan kuna bukata.
That did not work well.	Hakan bai yi kyau ba.
But your advice says.	Amma shawarar ku ce.
What is it?	Shin menene.
We're done.	Mun gama.
I kept looking up.	Na ci gaba da kallon sama.
It is not an easy task.	Ba abu mai sauƙi ba ne.
Up to this point.	Har zuwa wannan lokaci.
I did so and I worked fine.	Na yi haka kuma na yi aiki lafiya.
She can't decide to remove it or not.	Ba za ta iya yanke shawarar cire shi ko a'a ba.
Take care of another person.	Kula da wani mutum.
You can change it as you wish.	Kuna iya canza shi yadda kuke so.
Talk to them.	Magana da su yayi dadi.
He wanted to do everything.	Ya so ya yi komai.
She should not return and she should not enter.	Kada ta koma kuma bata shiga ba.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Ban tabbata menene matsalar ba.
And hear this.	Kuma ji wannan.
But they did not read carefully.	Amma ba su karanta a hankali ba.
Leaving is not something you do only once.	Barin ba abu ne da kuke yi sau ɗaya kawai ba.
We are talking about that.	Muna magana akan hakan.
It was to protect myself.	Ya kasance don kare kaina.
I had trouble seeing the plane.	Na sami matsala ganin jirgin.
They don't want me.	Ba ni ne suke so ba.
It's a pity.	Abin bakin ciki ne.
I stopped all my volunteer work.	Na daina duk aikin sa kai na.
But it goes beyond that.	Amma ya wuce haka.
I still have them as before.	Har yanzu ina da su kamar da.
We haven't seen much yet.	Ba mu ga wani abu da yawa ba tukuna.
So you have to respond, in what you see happening.	Don haka dole ne ku amsa, a cikin abin da kuke gani ya faru.
All day trip, and nothing interesting was found.	Duk ranar tafiya, kuma babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa da aka samu.
Obviously, this is something that requires work for many people.	Babu shakka, wannan wani abu ne da ke buƙatar aiki ga mutane da yawa.
Work is time consuming.	Aiki yana cin lokaci mai yawa.
They are getting better.	Suna samun lafiya.
What happens if we lose them?	Me zai faru idan muka rasa su?.
He made a lot of money.	Ya samu kudi da yawa.
They will not work.	Ba za su yi aiki ba.
I think I can fight you.	Ina tsammanin zan iya yin fada da ku.
This food is not good for some.	Wannan abincin ba shi da daɗi ga wasu.
Maybe she will keep talking to me.	Wataƙila za ta ci gaba da magana da ni.
This is a lie.	Wannan karya ne.
What do you want to eat today?	Me kuke so ku ci yau?
Make it interesting.	Sanya shi ban sha'awa.
Everyone loves me.	Kowa yana so na.
I love you and I will always love you.	Ina son ku kuma koyaushe zan so ku.
Do more of them next year.	Yi fiye da su a shekara mai zuwa.
Time goes by tomorrow and another day.	Lokaci yana tafiya gobe kuma wata rana.
We would have gotten up.	Da mun tashi.
I knew she would enjoy it.	Na san za ta ji daɗi.
If not, wait until it is done.	Idan ba haka ba, jira har sai ya yi.
I was happy with it.	Na yi farin ciki da shi.
Think before you speak.	Ka yi tunani kafin ka yi magana.
That's what we did.	Haka muka yi.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
He did very well.	Hakan yayi sosai.
I remember she was crying a lot.	Na tuna tana kuka sosai.
We are here for you.	Muna nan don ku.
Take time, but not too much time.	Ɗauki lokaci, amma ba lokaci mai yawa ba.
They keep going.	Suna ci gaba.
I can be used more.	Ana iya ƙara amfani da ni.
I came up with everything.	Na fito da komai.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
But not too big.	Amma ba ma girma ba.
The water of life itself.	Ruwan rai kansa.
We do not know why the man did that.	Ba mu san dalilin da ya sa mutumin ya yi haka ba.
She hit it again, again, again.	Ta sake buga shi, sake, sake.
Of course this is happening.	Tabbas hakan yana faruwa.
To say anything.	Don in ce komai.
I am very tired.	Na gaji sosai.
We live here now and need help.	Muna zaune a nan yanzu kuma muna buƙatar taimako.
Travel time.	Lokacin tafiya.
It is the first thing.	Shine abu na daya.
That is a fact.	Hakan ya tabbata.
That will not happen.	Hakan ba zai faru ba.
It is the best thing.	Shi ne mafi kyawun abu.
If they have, you are expected to quit.	Idan suna da, ana tsammanin ku daina.
She is coming over the weekend to help me.	Tana zuwa karshen mako don ta taimake ni.
I never got them.	Ban taba samun su ba.
It was also not opened last night.	Haka kuma ba a bude daren jiya ba.
I wonder where it came from.	Ina mamakin daga ina ya fito.
Look at this.	Kalli wannan.
Sent.	Aka aika.
No problem, we said.	Ba matsala, mun ce.
I'm tired of fighting.	Na gaji da fada.
But there is a way.	Amma akwai hanyar yin hakan.
It should not have happened.	Bai kamata ya faru ba.
Otherwise you break something.	In ba haka ba ka karya wani abu.
You can stay here or go home or something.	Kuna iya zama a nan ko ku tafi gida ko wani abu.
Maybe she was.	Wataƙila ta kasance.
Pay them.	Ku biya su.
I am in charge of it.	Ni ne mai kula da ita.
An unusual name.	Sunan da ba a saba gani ba.
I think we have a song.	Ina tsammanin muna da waƙa.
He did not know what to say.	Bai san me zai ce ba.
It may not be for others.	Yana iya zama ba ga wasu ba.
It doesn’t need to be harder than that.	Ba ya buƙatar zama da wahala fiye da haka.
We do what everyone else does.	Muna yin abin da kowa yake yi.
They tried to kill him by force.	Sun yi ƙoƙarin kashe shi ta hanyar aiki.
He will get nothing.	Ba zai samu komai ba.
You can see, right ?.	Kuna iya gani, daidai?.
I do not like.	Ba na so.
I am here caring for the children.	Ina nan ina kula da yara.
You should be happy for that.	Ya kamata ku yi farin ciki don wannan.
We just want to keep hearing this amazing thing.	Muna so kawai mu ci gaba da jin wannan abin mamaki.
The man is just walking.	Mutumin yana tafiya kawai.
It's a terrible injury.	Yana da mummunan rauni.
He is still at work.	Har yanzu yana kan aiki.
I hope you come back one day.	Ina fatan za ku dawo wata rana.
Doing it quickly remains.	Yin shi da sauri ya kasance.
Maybe we will.	Wataƙila za mu yi.
You know, it's a little bit of both.	Ka sani, da ɗan duka biyu ne.
I am not the same, she is not the same.	Ni ba daya nake ba, ita ma ba ta kasance ba.
Make it though.	Sanya shi duk da haka.
Yet there is something about it.	Amma duk da haka akwai wani abu game da shi.
And what is this? 	Kuma menene wannan?
He had nowhere to sleep at night.	Ba shi da inda zai kwana a daren.
It was decided to celebrate.	An yanke shawarar cewa a yi bikin.
In the past, this was the real thing.	A baya, wannan shine ainihin abin da ya dace.
They can be used in an inappropriate way.	Ana iya amfani da su ta hanyar da ba ta dace ba.
Just to ensure safety.	Kawai don tabbatar da lafiya.
I said earlier.	Na fada a baya.
He has been waiting since morning.	Tun safe yake jira.
They should be numerous.	Ya kamata su kasance da yawa.
I don't feel that way today.	Ba na jin haka a yau.
This is more than last, of course.	Wannan ya fi na ƙarshe, tabbas.
I don't even know how.	Ban ma san yadda ba.
I'll just hear.	Zan ji kawai.
I still haven't heard from them.	Har yanzu ban ji su ba.
I know he knows us.	Na san ya san mu.
It’s a lot here.	Yana da yawa a nan.
It was as if I had been taken away.	Ya zama kamar an cire min.
I hope you like them.	Ina fatan kuna son su.
This will never do.	Wannan ba zai taba yi ba.
Maybe time will tell.	Watakila da lokaci zai tafi.
Otherwise you are living at the time.	In ba haka ba kuna rayuwa a lokacin.
I still do not like the place.	Har yanzu ba na son wurin.
And we’ve been able to do a lot of things for people.	Kuma mun sami damar yi wa mutane abubuwa da yawa.
Many people liked it.	Mutane da yawa sun so shi.
From the beginning, things went wrong.	Tun daga farko, abubuwa sun yi kuskure.
She knows what she wants in life.	Ta san abin da take so a rayuwa.
I can talk to you.	Zan iya yi muku magana da su.
This article is organized as follows.	An shirya wannan labarin kamar haka.
Do not enter the house.	Kar ku shiga gidan.
Not so with people. 	Ba haka yake ga mutane ba. 
you just can't understand.	kawai ka kasa gane.
No one knows where he lives.	Babu wanda ya san inda yake zaune.
It really does.	Yana yi da gaske.
And he has a lot of money.	Kuma yana da kudi da yawa.
But they cannot be true.	Amma ba za su iya zama gaskiya ba.
He also did not.	Shi ma bai yi ba.
Make what you want.	Ku sanya abin da kuke so.
We didn't remove it very well.	Ba mu cire shi sosai ba.
I found a way.	Na sami wata hanya.
You are wrong about that.	Kun yi kuskure game da hakan.
Now someone came and told us to change.	Yanzu wani ya zo ya ce mu canza.
Too much.	Yayi yawa.
You know.	Ka sani.
I did not expect him to.	Ban yi tsammanin zai yi ba.
I did a great job.	Na yi babban aiki.
I eat and sleep and just think of them.	Ina ci ina barci kuma ina tunanin su kawai.
Give him fresh water.	Ka ba shi ruwa mai dadi.
Stay in one place.	Tsaya wuri guda.
It was very interesting to see what was going on there.	Yana da ban sha'awa sosai don ganin abin da ke faruwa a can.
It will not return until after your flight has taken off.	Ba zai dawo ba sai bayan jirgin ka ya tashi.
He did not.	Bai yi ba.
We must be very careful in everything we do now.	Dole ne mu kula sosai a duk abin da muke yi a yanzu.
He is here doing something good.	Yana nan inda yake yin wani abu mai kyau.
I enjoy seeing people.	Ina jin daɗin ganin mutane.
He traveled a long way to see that happen.	Yayi tafiya sosai don ganin hakan ya faru.
They work for us.	Suna yi mana aiki.
So it is not the same thing.	Don haka ba abu daya bane.
One does not know.	Mutum bai sani ba.
I want to change that.	Ina so in canza hakan.
Not how they decided to publish it.	Ba yadda suka yanke shawarar buga shi ba.
Even heaven knows what.	Ko sama ta san me.
Open dinner only.	Bude abincin dare kawai.
Another water there is a name.	Wani ruwa akwai suna.
I will go ahead tonight.	Zan je gaba a daren yau.
No one recognized them.	Ba wanda ya gane su.
But they will do well.	Amma za su yi kyau.
I am at work.	Ina kan aiki.
People are playing with them, but it is not enough.	Mutane suna wasa da su, amma bai isa ba.
I want to talk.	Ina so in yi magana.
It is better to stay single.	Gara ya zauna ba aure.
He bought a new home.	Ya sayi sabon gida.
It was a busy day.	A ranar ta fi yin aiki.
If he is asleep, go back to sleep.	Idan yana barci, sai ku koma barci.
It is strange to say the least.	Wani abin mamaki ne a ce ko kadan.
I have to run.	Dole ne in yi gudu.
I never thought so.	Ban taba yin tunani ba.
You are not a citizen here.	Kai ba dan kasa ba ne a nan.
Interesting reading.	Karatu mai ban sha'awa.
You did the right thing.	Kun yi abin da ya dace.
I tried too much.	Na yi ƙoƙari na yi yawa.
This will leave.	Wannan zai bari.
There is a lot he does not know about it.	Akwai da yawa da bai sani ba game da shi.
They are so beautiful.	Suna da kyau sosai.
I have to work hard to make that happen.	Ya kamata in yi aiki da gaske don ganin hakan ta faru.
Now, everyone wants to hear them again.	Yanzu, kowa yana so ya sake jin su.
Of course it was not easy.	Tabbas bai kasance mai sauƙi ba.
Hopefully something will be suggested.	Da fatan za a ba da shawarar wani abu.
They are sick, they are too weak to work.	Ba su da lafiya, sun yi rauni da yawa don yin aiki.
Another trip is near.	Wani tafiya ya kusa.
I still think so.	Har yanzu ina tunanin hakan.
Or try it.	Ko kuma gwada shi.
But that is next week.	Amma mako na gaba kenan.
I was unsure about it.	Na yi rashin tabbas game da shi.
It feels cold.	Ya ji sanyi.
They should have covered it years ago.	Ya kamata su rufe shi shekaru da suka wuce.
We have to look.	Dole ne mu duba.
We do not agree with that.	Ba mu yarda da hakan ba.
We do not ask for help from you or anyone else.	Ba ma neman taimako daga gare ku ko kuma babu wani.
In the afternoon he could not eat.	Da rana ba zai iya ci ba.
Looking for me to stay at home and wait for her to come home.	Neman in zauna a gida in jira ta ta zo gida.
Take me home, please.	Kai ni gida, don Allah.
I have to be sick.	Dole ne in yi rashin lafiya.
It shows more than usual.	Ya nuna fiye da saba.
It is not clear whether it will continue.	Ba a bayyana ko za a ci gaba ba.
Less ground.	Kasa kadan.
But you stay there.	Amma ka tsaya a can.
That’s interesting though.	Hakan yana da ban sha'awa ko da yake.
Tell me where it is.	Fada min inda yake.
To know you a little.	Don sanin ku kadan.
I never got well outside.	Ban sake samun lafiya a waje ba.
And he is about to succeed.	Kuma ya kusa samun nasara.
Everyone will die.	Kowa zai mutu.
They started arresting us.	Sai suka fara kama mu.
As they do.	Kamar yadda suke yi.
Don't say anything, and do me a favor later.	Kada ka ce komai, kuma ka yi min kyau sosai daga baya.
Try to remember the last time you bought something.	Yi ƙoƙarin tuna lokacin ƙarshe da kuka sayi wani abu.
He wants me to tell him.	Yana so in fada masa.
They met to drink.	Sun hadu don sha.
I should tell you something.	Ya kamata in gaya muku wani abu.
Now try a third time.	Yanzu gwada karo na uku.
The kids at school did well with it.	Yara a makaranta sun yi kyau tare da shi.
I am leaving.	Zan tafi.
Nothing big.	Babu babban abu.
She sighed as she sat up.	Ta fad'a a zaune.
You are not alone in this.	Kai kaɗai ba ka cikin wannan.
We are not even married.	Ba mu ma yi aure ba.
I am not, she thought.	Ni ba ni ba ce, ta yi tunani.
It is better to stay safe.	Gara a zauna lafiya.
I tried it but I couldn't.	Na gwada ta haka amma ban iya ba.
Please come back.	Don Allah mu dawo.
But they left it at that.	Amma sun bar shi a haka.
It goes like this.	Yana tafiya kamar haka.
We don't give them here.	Ba mu ba su a nan.
Scary boy.	Yaro mai tsoro.
It has not been used since its purchase.	Ba a yi amfani da shi ba tun lokacin da aka saya.
They know each other, they are together.	Sun san juna, suna tare.
I know she has.	Na san tana da.
Why would he do such a thing.	Me yasa zai yi irin wannan abu.
Just a moment!	Dan lokaci kawai!
I think it can just work.	Ina tsammanin zai iya aiki kawai.
He read and looked.	Ya karanta ya duba.
She doesn't have much money.	Ba ta da kuɗi da yawa.
However, it seems to be moving slowly.	Duk da haka, da alama yana tafiya a hankali.
Here is another one, but this time in the car.	Sai ga wani, amma wannan lokacin a cikin mota.
It is in error because an error occurred.	Yana cikin kuskure saboda kuskure ya faru.
This is what will happen.	Wannan shi ne abin da zai faru.
I don't even do such things anymore.	Ba na ma yin irin waɗannan abubuwan kuma.
It all at the same time.	Yana duka a lokaci guda.
I do not know what to say.	Ban san me kuma zan ce ba.
I do not know how to do this.	Ban san yadda zan yi wannan ba.
It's good, but sad.	Yana da kyau, amma bakin ciki.
Little if anyone would know.	Kadan idan wani zai sani.
So, "what dinner?" 	Don haka, "menene abincin dare?"
Nothing to fear from me.	Ba abin da za ku ji tsoro daga gare ni.
Keep it inside and keep walking.	Ka ajiye shi a ciki ka ci gaba da tafiya.
It makes us interested in each other.	Ta sa mu sha'awar juna.
Be afraid not to come back.	Ku ji tsoron kada ku dawo.
They will be together, eventually.	Za su kasance tare, a ƙarshe.
This is where she has to go.	A nan ne dole ta tafi.
I don't feel it at all.	Ba na ji ko kadan.
You never know when you might be out there.	Ba ku taɓa sanin lokacin da za ku iya fita waje ba.
I used to work here you know.	Na kasance ina aiki a nan ka sani.
I had lunch with him a month ago.	Na ci abincin rana tare da shi wata daya da ya wuce.
They were like happy children.	Sun kasance kamar yara masu farin ciki.
I plan to do these every week.	Ina shirin yin waɗannan kowane mako.
Probably nothing to discover.	Wataƙila ba abin da za a gano.
We thought he was killed.	Mun yi tsammanin an kashe shi.
Man, it's good.	Mutum, yana da kyau.
He saw nothing.	Bai ga komai ba.
Day in, day out.	Rana a, rana fita.
Feels like a second home.	Ji kamar gida na biyu.
He has a dog with him.	Yana da kare tare da shi.
It has nothing else to say.	Ba shi da sauran abin cewa.
It can be used for beauty.	Ana iya amfani da shi don kyau.
He needs to be able to keep fighting to make a living.	Yana bukatar ya iya ci gaba da fada don yin rayuwa.
Please help me to do it.	Don Allah a taimake ni in yi shi.
He couldn't believe she was really dead.	Ya kasa yarda da gaske ta mutu.
I know everything you have to say.	Na san duk abin da za ku ce.
Go to the place where the sun came up.	Tafi zuwa wurin da rana ta fito.
All weekend we were very happy.	Duk karshen mako muna farin ciki sosai.
Not much has changed.	Ba abu mai yawa ya canza ba.
She gave it to me.	Ta bashi ni.
Make sure you find out.	Tabbatar kun gano.
He should return home.	Ya kamata ya koma gida.
They were killed.	An kashe su.
They are so beautiful.	Suna da kyau haka.
With us, you will never make a mistake.	Tare da mu, tabbas ba za ku taɓa yin kuskure ba.
This is too cold.	Wannan yayi sanyi sosai.
So it is very difficult to work.	Don haka yana da matukar wahala a yi aiki.
Now, they make it look easy.	Yanzu, sun sanya shi kama da sauƙi.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
He thinks the world has given him a livelihood.	Yana tunanin duniya ta bashi abin rayuwa.
This is a great place to stay.	Wannan wuri ne mai kyau don zama.
It still is, if you want to know.	Har yanzu ya kasance, idan kuna son sani.
I eat there.	A can nake ci.
He is a man who loves good food.	Mutum ne mai son abinci mai kyau.
It suits us.	Ya dace da mu.
You don't want to grow too much, do you?	Ba ka son ka yi girma sosai, ko?
I caught	Na kama
Obviously there is something wrong.	Babu shakka akwai wani abu ba daidai ba.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
I don't know what to do with it.	Ban san me zan yi da shi ba.
Every month.	Kowane wata guda.
You will leave me.	Za ku bar ni.
It feels good.	Ya ji dadi.
So it is.	Haka ma haka.
He will get some right.	Zai sami ɗan dama.
It was cold last night.	An yi sanyi a daren jiya.
The three of us got up and heard the door open.	Mu uku muka daga kai sai muka ji an bude kofar.
Trying not to work.	Ƙoƙarin baya aiki.
That's us.	Shi ke gare mu.
It travels fast.	Yana tafiya da sauri.
She must have died so.	Dole ta mutu don haka.
I understand time.	Na fahimci lokaci.
But no one really knows what will happen.	Amma, babu wanda ya san abin da zai faru.
Why, in her day.	Me ya sa, a cikin rana ta.
He really thought things were going well with her.	Da gaske ya yi tunanin abubuwa da ita sun yi kyau sosai.
She grew up fast.	Ta girma da sauri.
We are all being played.	Ana wasa da mu duka.
Dare to fall.	Dare fada.
That made everyone laugh.	Hakan yasa kowa dariya.
It worked fine for a while.	An yi aiki daidai na ɗan lokaci.
Please hear me.	Da fatan za a ji ni.
Wrong, how.	Ba daidai ba, ta yaya.
Maybe they weren’t paid.	Watakila ba a biya su ba.
Health care is working.	Kula da lafiya yana aiki.
Or an event, really.	Ko wani taron, da gaske.
I'm not sure if he did.	Ban tabbata ko ya yi ba.
This is a big mistake.	Wannan babban kuskure ne.
He did not stop.	Bai tsaya ba.
You don't have to say until you want to say.	Ba sai ka fada ba sai kana son fada.
It can happen to anyone.	Yana iya faruwa ga kowa.
They have everything to lose.	Suna da duk abin da za su rasa.
They started talking.	Suka fara magana.
I can't get into this again.	Ba zan iya sake shiga cikin wannan ba.
He knew it was not about him.	Ya san ba game da shi ba ne.
She kept looking down.	Ta ci gaba da kallon kasa.
You haven't heard anything yet.	Ba ku ji komai ba tukuna.
You won the game.	Kun ci wasan.
It was the same tonight.	Haka ya kasance a daren yau.
Where we are.	Inda muke.
You have to be careful.	Dole ne ku yi hankali.
It's a really good way to make a living.	Hanya ce mai kyau da gaske don yin rayuwa.
But come on.	Amma zo.
He talked about it before.	Ya yi magana a kai a baya.
Worked or not done.	An yi aiki ko ba a yi ba.
Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t work.	Wani lokaci suna aiki, wani lokacin ba sa yin aiki.
This can easily happen again.	Hakan na iya sake faruwa cikin sauƙi.
Only two kind suited me.	Biyu kawai irin dace da ni.
He did not know.	Bai sani ba.
This is an interesting thing.	Wannan abu ne mai ban sha'awa.
I think so now.	Ina ganin haka yanzu.
We are not interested in that.	Ba mu da sha'awar hakan.
I found out why they wanted it.	Na sami dalilin da ya sa suke so.
They always work.	Kullum suna aiki.
It's just beautiful.	Yana da kyau kawai.
This is a bad idea.	Wannan mummunan tunani ne.
Hot and cold.	Zafi da sanyi.
I told him not to worry.	Na ce masa kar ya damu da hakan.
But nothing.	Amma babu komai.
He studied for years.	Ya yi karatu tsawon shekaru.
The truth is no one knows.	Gaskiya ba wanda ya sani.
She expected something bigger.	Ta yi tsammanin wani abu mafi girma.
To this day we do.	Har yau muna yi.
She helped out and made dinner for everyone.	Ta taimaka fita da yin abincin dare ga kowa da kowa.
And she loves it.	Kuma ta so shi.
Maybe she did everything.	Watakila ta yi komai.
Why did they do that?	Me yasa suka yi haka?
I think of it more than sleep.	Ina tunanin shi fiye da barci.
This is very smart, very big.	Wannan yana da hankali sosai, ya yi girma sosai.
We will start slowly.	Za mu fara a hankali.
How old are you?	Shekara nawa kenan.
So maybe there's something in it.	Don haka watakila akwai wani abu a ciki.
So make sure you drink water to make water.	Don haka a tabbata an sha ruwa don yin ruwa.
So it started to rain.	Don haka sai aka fara ruwan sama.
But not sure.	Amma ba tabbas.
The second person is not very well.	Mutum na biyu ba shi da lafiya sosai.
That is why they are children.	Shi yasa suke yara.
We don’t need to do anything.	Ba mu buƙatar yin wani abu ba.
He knows you are here.	Ya san kuna nan.
They started doing that.	Sun fara yin haka.
But they will not do that.	Amma ba za su yi hakan ba.
This is about what they will get.	Wannan game da abin da za su samu ke nan.
Accommodation may be available.	Ana iya samun wurin kwana.
Where did that come from?	Daga ina hakan ya fito?
And she was on it.	Kuma ta kasance a kan shi.
I could not bring myself to continue.	Na kasa kawo kaina in ci gaba.
The reason is simpler, and better, than that.	Dalilin ya fi sauƙi, kuma mafi kyau, fiye da haka.
She wanted to learn everything.	Ta so ta koyi komai.
No, not just on her.	A'a, ba kawai a kan ta ba.
Nothing about that.	Babu komai game da hakan.
It seems to need one.	Da alama yana bukatar daya.
Someone who knows you.	Mutumin da ya san ku.
And such.	Kuma irin.
Some will stop before it really starts.	Wasu za su daina kafin ya fara da gaske.
Maybe I was good.	Wataƙila na kasance mai kyau.
Now everything is working fine.	Yanzu komai yana aiki lafiya.
And that's fine.	Kuma hakan yayi kyau.
He was alone in the room at the time.	Shi kadai a dakin a lokacin.
They should not do this.	Bai kamata su yi wannan ba.
Thinking of something is good, because we get what we want.	Tunanin wani abu yayi kyau, saboda muna samun abin da muke so.
Not much and not fast.	Ba da yawa kuma ba da sauri ba.
Not now and not later.	Ba yanzu ba kuma ba daga baya ba.
It is a way of doing it, if it is considered necessary.	Wata hanya ce ta yin ta, idan ana tunanin ya zama dole.
But it's really, really great.	Amma yana da gaske, da gaske mai girma.
Somehow, interesting.	Ko ta yaya, ban sha'awa.
I should run.	Ya kamata in gudu.
That will bring everything back to normal.	Hakan zai dawo da komai daidai.
I agree with you there.	Na yarda da ku a can.
But she could close the door.	Amma ta iya rufe kofar.
No one knows what people will come out of there.	Babu wanda ya san abin da mutane za su fito daga wurin.
Every home run is a bad call.	Kowane gudu na gida mummunan kira ne.
At this point, however, we need to stop and think again.	A wannan lokacin, duk da haka, muna bukatar mu tsaya mu sake tunani.
I know and understand how they feel.	Na sani kuma na fahimci yadda suke ji.
Lunch was delicious.	Abincin rana sun yi dadi.
They are very nice and comfortable.	Suna da kyau sosai kuma masu jin dadi.
The two things are very similar.	Abubuwa biyu suna kama da juna sosai.
I want to know everything about it.	Ina so in san komai game da ita.
It will help when things look a lot different, as they will.	Zai taimaka lokacin da abubuwa suka yi kama da yawa, kamar yadda za su yi.
I said like that.	Na ce kamar haka.
Feel that we can fly, but only so far.	Jin cewa za mu iya tashi, amma kawai ya zuwa yanzu.
Otherwise it will be fine.	In ba haka ba zai yi kyau.
He gives in the end.	Ya ba da a ƙarshe.
It will not succeed!	Ba zai yi nasara ba!
He kept walking, as he always did.	Ya ci gaba da tafiya, kamar yadda ake yi a kowane lokaci.
The police are waiting to see you.	'Yan sanda suna tsammanin ganin ku.
He was in it, now.	Ya kasance a ciki, yanzu.
And, of course, you succeed.	Kuma, ba shakka, kuna nasara.
It helps if you know they are coming.	Yana taimaka idan kun san suna zuwa.
He just runs as fast as he can.	Gudu kawai yake yi har ya iya.
About what he is said to have done.	Game da abin da aka ce ya yi ne.
I kept saving it.	Na ci gaba da ajiye shi.
We must die as you must.	Dole ne mu mutu kamar yadda dole ne ku.
It should be.	Ya kamata ya kasance.
It is not difficult.	Ba wuya.
Unidentified.	Ba a gano ba.
We live in a fast-paced world.	Muna rayuwa a cikin duniya mai girma da sauri.
I do not speak to anyone.	Ba na magana da kowa.
Playing together can be difficult.	Yin wasa tare yana iya zama da wahala.
I did not feel myself.	Ban ji kaina ba.
If he leaves now, she will be alone.	Idan ya tafi yanzu, za ta kasance ita kaɗai.
It comes out of the hand.	Yana fita daga hannu.
I can’t just leave them there.	Ba zan iya barin su kawai a can ba.
As in other things.	Kamar yadda yake cikin sauran abubuwa.
Immediately, please.	Nan da nan, don Allah.
I have played with my mind more than once.	Na yi wasa da tunani fiye da sau ɗaya.
I waited for the story, but nothing came of it.	Na jira labarin, amma babu abin da ya zo.
Give it a try.	Ka bashi .
But it is still something.	Amma har yanzu wani abu ne.
You can imagine what happens next.	Kuna iya tunanin abin da ya faru a gaba.
The project appears to have been successful.	Aikin ya bayyana an yi nasara.
Maybe it was a mistake, of course.	Wataƙila kuskure ne, ba shakka.
We just worked.	Mun yi aiki kawai.
Here's how it works.	Ga yadda abin yake.
Everything can be food.	Komai na iya zama abinci.
We can not explain how they were injured.	Ba za mu iya bayyana yadda suka ji rauni ba.
Or what is that.	Ko menene hakan.
We must do something right.	Dole ne mu yi wani abu daidai.
Don't play with us.	Kar ku yi wasa da mu.
Even if you kill me, it will not work.	Ko ka kashe ni, ba zai yi amfani ba.
I really don't think so.	Ni da gaske ban yi tunanin haka ba.
Not mine.	Ba nawa ba ne.
However, it is not known how this happened.	Ko da yake, ba a san yadda hakan ya faru ba.
He talked about high unemployment.	Ya yi magana game da yawan rashin aikin yi.
Right now.	A yanzu haka.
The next thing you know, he is dead.	Abu na gaba da kuka sani, ya mutu.
This is interesting and a little difficult to drink.	Wannan yana da ban sha'awa kuma yana da ɗan wahala a sha.
I'll take you somewhere.	Ina kai ku wani wuri.
If you succeed, you succeed.	Idan ka yi nasara, ka yi nasara.
He closed the door.	Ya rufe kofar.
How much is too much.	Nawa yayi yawa.
No one cared.	Babu wanda ya kula shi.
It's nothing.	Ba komai bane.
You should be careful.	Ya kamata ku yi hankali.
Somehow it has to be done.	Ko ta yaya sai an yi.
Can you know when it will rain?	Za a iya sanin lokacin da za a yi ruwan sama?
Let things happen.	Bari abubuwa su faru.
She said she had no other answer.	Ta ce ba ta da sauran amsa.
I do not think they were so close.	Bana jin sun kasance kusa haka.
She would not let me go with anyone.	Ba za ta bar ni in tafi da kowa ba.
Just like we do when we are in a car.	Kamar yadda muke yi idan muna cikin mota.
However, many others are uncertain.	Duk da haka, wasu da yawa ba su da tabbas.
Right or wrong,	Dama ko kuskure,
No one will know that there is.	Babu wanda zai san cewa akwai.
I am also a runner.	Ni kuma mai gudu ne.
It gives me a lot of hope.	Yana ba ni fata mai yawa.
I would never do such a thing.	Ba zan taɓa yin irin wannan abu ba.
That would be a great thing.	Wannan zai zama babban abu.
I don't expect to see you again.	Ban yi tsammanin sake ganin ku ba.
It's more than a car.	Ya fi mota.
Somehow, they died.	Ko ta yaya, sun mutu.
I can not live like that anymore.	Ba zan iya rayuwa haka ba kuma.
Is it difficult to travel?	Tafiya ya yi wuya?
He did them all.	Ya yi su duka.
You are the one who can bring this.	Ku ne za ku iya kawo wannan.
And we are still here.	Kuma muna nan har yanzu.
He wasted no time.	Bai bata lokaci ba.
I don’t want to give up on you, you see.	Ba na so in ba da kai, ka gani.
But don’t think I don’t like food though.	Amma kar ka yi tunanin ba na son abincin ko da yake.
We are very happy to have you.	Muna matukar farin ciki da samun ku.
She, too, heard another sound.	Ita ma ta sake jin wani kara.
Hopefully there will be help with a new seat.	Da fatan za a sami taimako da sabon wurin zama.
Even more.	Ko da yawa.
He said she was smoking.	Yace tana shan taba.
He didn't even think about it.	Bai ko tunanin hakan ba.
I actually planned to do the same thing.	A gaskiya na yi shirin yin irin wannan abu.
But with him, mine, mine.	Amma da shi, nawa, nawa.
give her time, and she will do it right.	ka ba ta lokaci, kuma za ta yi daidai.
Life is unpredictable.	Rayuwa ba ta da tabbas.
Not for everyone.	Ba don kowa ba.
It is still difficult to let her go.	Har yanzu da wuya a yarda ta tafi.
To continue.	Don ci gaba.
You have never known me.	Ba ku taɓa sani ba tare da ni.
It's not hard to see.	Ba abu ne mai wahala a gani ba.
Where they are not, it will stop.	Inda ba su, zai tsaya.
We can't see.	Ba za mu iya gani ba.
Increase heat to high.	Ƙara zafi zuwa sama.
He could not get enough.	Ya kasa samun isa.
I will recognize him.	Zan gane shi.
Have fun.	Yi abubuwan jin daɗi.
I never believed them.	Ban taba yarda da su ba.
On and on.	A da kuma a kan.
Just go here.	Kawai je nan.
She hopes that will not be a problem.	Ta yi fatan hakan ba zai zama matsala ba.
He won't come, he thought.	Ba zai zo ba, ya yi tunani.
Just one thing.	Abu daya kawai.
Maybe he was playing.	Wataƙila ya kasance yana wasa.
So it was.	Don haka abin ya kasance.
He failed us.	Ya kasa mu.
That's hard to say.	Wannan ke da wuya a ce.
You are wasting money, she said.	Kuna bata kudi, ita ce.
I will make it happen.	Zan sa ya faru.
So we will not do either.	Don haka mu ma ba za mu yi ba.
Things started to catch up with me.	Abubuwa sun fara kama ni.
It has not changed.	Bai canza ba.
But there is something wrong.	Amma akwai abin da bai dace ba.
He spoke quickly.	Yayi magana da sauri.
We can find others like them.	Za mu iya samun wasu kamar su.
I could not find a way to proceed.	Na kasa samun yadda zan ci gaba.
It was a little interesting, perhaps, the first two times.	Ya kasance ɗan ban sha'awa, watakila, na farko biyu sau.
Of course we would never agree.	Babu shakka ba za mu taba yarda ba.
Some take it immediately.	Wasu suna kai shi nan da nan.
I can't tell people these things. 	Ba zan iya gaya wa mutane waɗannan abubuwa ba. 
She does not want to lie.	Ba ta son yin karya.
And about to kill me.	Kuma game da kashe ni.
He could not see.	Bai iya gani ba.
He sat in the car.	Ya zauna a cikin motar.
Someone took me to the side of the road.	Wani ya kai ni bakin hanya.
But not necessarily.	Amma ba lallai ba ne.
The doctor revealed that she was pregnant.	Likitan ya bayyana cewa tana da ciki.
We can go and see other people every day.	Za mu iya zuwa mu kalli sauran mutane kowace rana.
I don't like this surprise.	Ba na son wannan abin mamaki.
Of course he will do it again.	Tabbas zai sake yin.
It has been going on since its inception.	Yana faruwa tun lokacin da aka fara.
I do not mind.	Ban damu ba.
No one cared.	Babu wanda ya kula.
You can even wear more than one at a time.	Kuna iya ma sa fiye da ɗaya a lokaci ɗaya.
They just have each other.	Suna da juna kawai.
But they were always coming.	Amma sun kasance koyaushe suna zuwa.
They happen, but not often.	Suna faruwa, amma ba sau da yawa ba.
You have to play with what you get.	Dole ne ku yi wasa da abin da kuka samu.
Eager to see if he remembered her.	Cikin sha'awar ganin ko ya tuna da ita.
So they will not meet.	Don haka ba za su hadu ba.
Just from the beginning.	Kamar tun daga farko.
It has to be.	Dole ne ya kasance.
That would be a great help.	Hakan zai taimaka sosai.
A policeman in a raincoat is out of hand.	Wani dan sanda a cikin rigar ruwan sama yana daga hannu.
Apparently she did not.	Da alama ba ta yi ba.
Maybe I'm dead	Wataƙila na mutu
If you smoke, now is the time to quit.	Idan kuna shan taba, yanzu shine lokacin da za a daina.
People what they will see and know best.	Mutane abin da za su gani kuma su san mafi kyau.
She paid the bill.	Ta biya kudi.
You can try this for yourself.	Kuna iya gwada wannan da kanku.
Near the gas station.	Kusa da tashar mai.
It works but not in the right way.	Yana aiki amma ba ta hanyar da ta dace ba.
But you are used to it.	Amma ka saba da shi.
And that can only work.	Kuma hakan na iya yin aiki kawai.
He should run by car.	Kamata yayi ya gudu da mota.
However, others are highly recommended.	Duk da haka, sauran ana ba da shawarar sosai.
Never hit the ground running.	Ba a taɓa ganin buga kasa ba.
From one you know.	Daga wanda kuka sani.
It could easily be me.	Yana da sauƙi zai iya zama ni.
I got up	Na tashi
And it works well.	Kuma yana aiki da kyau.
It did me really good.	Ya yi min kyau sosai.
She can't feel better now.	Ba ta iya ji da kyau yanzu.
Only if anything.	Kawai idan wani abu.
Not even a new home.	Ba ma sabon gida ba.
And they fly together.	Kuma suna tashi tare.
It is not the first time and it will not be the last.	Ba shine karo na farko ba kuma ba zai zama na ƙarshe ba.
She thought someone would protect him.	Ta yi tunanin wani zai kare shi.
Only after a meal.	Bayan cin abinci ne kawai.
And they do not know how to deal with it.	Kuma ba su san yadda za su yi da ita ba.
To fail, is to succeed.	Don kasa, shine a ci nasara.
He knew something was wrong.	Ya san wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
But without much thought.	Amma ba tare da tunani sosai ba.
It just doesn’t suit me.	Kawai bai dace da ni ba.
If anything, it's even worse.	Idan wani abu, ya fi haka.
It's been three years.	Shekara uku kenan.
There is no time for anything but work.	Babu lokacin komai sai aiki.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
She could not live like us.	Ba za ta iya rayuwa kamar mu ba.
They arrive at the house.	Suna isa gidan.
I agree with that.	Na yarda da wannan.
They drank a lot.	Sun sha da yawa.
She is very sick.	Bata da lafiya sosai.
He is not really in it.	Ba shi da gaske a ciki.
So be honest with yourself.	Don haka ku kasance masu gaskiya ga kanku.

People love this place.	Mutane suna son wannan wuri.
It’s a lot of talk.	Yana da yawan magana.
Let me tell you some things.	Bari in gaya muku wasu abubuwa.
It can not be good.	Ba zai iya zama mai kyau ba.
No one should go.	Babu wanda ya isa ya tafi.
To this day the man brought it.	Har yau mutumin ya kawo shi.
And if that were so, we would be in for a rude awakening.	Kuma da a ce haka ne, da mun shiga matsala.
No one enters, or leaves.	Babu mai shiga, ko fita.
And now we are ready to grow.	Kuma yanzu mun shirya don samun girma.
What are we eating tonight?	Me muke ci a daren yau?
This is sad.	Wannan abin bakin ciki ne.
And that is something you should keep in mind.	Kuma abin da ya kamata ku tuna ke nan.
They love someone so much, that they will never get it.	Suna son wani sosai, wanda ba za su taɓa samu ba.
Funny jokes.	Rashin hankali na ban dariya.
Sorry to hear that you are still fighting, there.	Yi hakuri da jin cewa har yanzu kuna yin fada, a can.
We saw this guy working a little bit.	Mun ga mutumin nan yana aiki kadan kadan.
I remember that I enjoyed it.	Na tuna cewa ina jin daɗin hakan.
He must have cried.	Tabbas yayi kuka.
Or nothing.	Ko ba komai.
He enjoyed being alone for a while.	Ya ɗan ji daɗi zama kaɗai na ɗan lokaci.
It hurts.	Yana zafi.
That's it.	Har ya samu kenan.
No one is new.	Babu kowa sabon kowa.
Many have come closer.	Da yawa sun zo kusa.
Then home ,.	Sai gida,.
That should tell us something.	Wannan ya kamata ya gaya mana wani abu.
I do, as it happens.	Ina yi, kamar yadda ya faru.
They write songs every day.	Suna rubuta waƙa kowace rana.
You will be a great person.	Za ku zama babban mutum.
Sometimes they need someone smart.	Wani lokaci suna buƙatar wani mai hankali.
Not knowing what to say.	Ba tare da sanin me za a ce ba.
She sat alone.	Ta zauna ita kadai.
Decent.	Mai kyau.
We found out he was going to be a kid.	Mun gano zai zama yaro.
They are there.	Suna wurin.
Someone who was upset did not feel comfortable.	Wani wanda ya damu bai ji dadi ba.
I want to bring my own.	Ina so in fito da nawa.
They were interested in fighting.	Sun kasance sha'awar fada.
We talk, but nothing happens.	Muna magana, amma ba abin da ya faru.
Where is the bus station?	Ina tashar bas?
She ate very little every day.	Kadan ta ci kowace rana.
I will give it a lot.	Zan ba shi da yawa.
Their clothes came out.	Rigar su ta fito waje.
She could not accept it.	Ba za ta iya yarda da shi ba.
I usually do.	Ina yawan yi.
Would you like to go outside?	Kuna so ku fita waje?
Probably not always.	Wataƙila ba koyaushe ba.
Children can recognize each other.	Yara za su iya gane juna.
That should not happen.	Hakan bai kamata ya faru ba.
I always have.	Ina da koyaushe.
Let's pay for it.	Mu biya shi.
We eat every day, sometimes twice a day.	Muna cin abinci kowace rana, wani lokacin sau biyu a rana.
We have three children.	Muna da yara uku.
Nor will there ever be a moon.	Haka kuma ba za a taba samun wata ba.
One country, one place.	Kasa daya, wuri daya.
I think it could be both.	Ina tsammanin zai iya zama duka biyu.
He also loved me.	Ya kuma so ni.
It just didn’t work.	Kawai bai yi aiki ba.
This is a strange thing, but it is not a bad thing.	Wannan wani abu ne mai ban mamaki, amma ba mummunan abu ba ne.
That comes with being human.	Wannan ya zo da zama mutum.
We will do the same.	Haka za mu yi.
They did not accept it.	Ba su yarda da ita ba.
To fly.	Don tashi.
He was with them.	Ya kasance tare da su.
What a great achievement.	Abin da babban samu.
It's a little hard to explain.	Yana da ɗan wuya a bayyana.
I don't want the day to end.	Ba na son ranar ta kare.
He will know when he rises.	Zai san lokacin da ya tashi.
I’ve seen it and it’s still good for me.	Na gani kuma har yanzu yana da kyau a gare ni.
.	.
And that is right for him.	Kuma hakan shi ne daidai a gare shi.
It's better.	Ya fi kyau.
They always tell me that.	Suna faɗa mini haka kullum.
She knew she was lost.	Ta san ta bata.
I do not know whether to hope or not.	Ban sani ba ko fatan ko a'a.
I told myself so.	Na fada wa kaina haka.
The house is beautiful.	Gidan yana da kyau.
See, why not go now.	Duba, me yasa ba za ku tafi ba yanzu.
There is but really.	Akwai amma da gaske.
Do not say or do anything.	Kar a ce ko yin komai.
The first tool was used.	An yi amfani da kayan aikin farko.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba abin mamaki ba ne.
One can do it front and back.	Mutum zai iya yin ta gaba da baya.
Reading these has been a lot of fun for me.	Karanta waɗannan ya kasance abin farin ciki sosai a gare ni.
If someone helped, they helped.	Idan wani ya taimaka, sun taimaka.
I want to get this money.	Ina so in sami wannan kuɗin.
I was very worried about him.	Na damu da shi sosai.
You are a child.	Kai yaro ne.
However, it was not easily reached.	Duk da haka, ba a isa gare shi cikin sauƙi ba.
I was outside.	Na yi waje.
There is nothing he will not do.	Babu abin da ba zai yi ba.
Stop for food.	Tsaya don abinci.
For a while it was a happy time.	Na ɗan lokaci lokacin farin ciki ne.
She did not like the idea.	Ba ta ji daɗin wannan tunanin ba.
It's very difficult.	Yana da wuya sosai.
He wants us to know him.	Yana so mu san shi.
I never knew you could do this.	Ban taba sanin za ku iya yin wannan ba.
They walk really well.	Suna tafiya da gaske.
I don't have much water.	Ba ni da ruwa da yawa.
To survive, you must eat.	Don rayuwa, dole ne ku ci.
He would not be that person.	Ba zai zama wannan mutumin ba.
It seems like nothing has changed.	Kamar babu abin da ya canza da gaske.
Better back then.	Gara na baya.
But that should not be the case.	Amma ba haka ya kamata ya kasance ba.
The world is huge.	Duniya tana da girma.
Things are not going well.	Abubuwa ba su yi kyau ba.
This is a good restaurant.	Wannan gidan abinci ne mai kyau.
I'm very sorry.	Ku yi hakuri.
And they have a lot of opportunities and they want help.	Kuma suna da damar da yawa kuma suna son taimako.
Maybe they were smoking or something.	Wataƙila sun kasance suna shan taba ko wani abu.
They seem to know everyone.	Da alama sun san kowa.
I always think I do this.	Kullum ina ganin ina yin wannan.
Quickly.	Da sauri.
I want to protect it.	Ina so in kare ta.
That's why it's all wrong.	Shi ya sa duk ba daidai ba ne.
They are known for it.	An san su da shi.
They go out and everyone goes with them.	Suna fita kowa ya tafi da su.
I love how they look and feel.	Ina son yadda suke kama da yadda suke ji.
She would expect you to just be there.	Za ta yi tsammanin za ku kasance a wurin kawai.
The past is not the future.	Abin da ya gabata ba shine gaba ba.
Don't be too careful.	Kar ku kasance da hankali sosai.
Today, very few people come here.	A yau, mutane kaɗan ne ke zuwa nan.
I do not know what to think.	Ban san me zan yi tunani ba.
I can't sleep tonight.	Ba zan iya barci a daren nan ba.
Now imagine they have lived there for years.	Yanzu ka yi tunanin sun zauna a can tsawon shekaru.
I can prepare it.	Zan iya shirya shi.
I will just say this.	Zan ce wannan kawai.
I'm glad to have that.	Ina jin daɗin samun hakan.
It sounds like it is, but maybe not.	Ji yake kamar ita ce, amma watakila a'a.
He is not himself.	Shi ba kansa ba ne.
They sued him.	Sun kawo kara a kansa.
We're sorry.	Mun yi hakuri.
This is not a bad thing.	Wannan ba mummunan abu ba ne.
Stay there and it was nice and healthy.	Tsaya a can kuma yana da kyau da lafiya.
And if we win them.	Kuma idan muka yi nasara da su.
The hand is gone, he still has not let go.	Hannu ya kare, har yanzu bai bari ya tafi ba.
Put the kids on it.	Saka yara a kansa.
It was a beautiful day.	Rana ce mai kyau.
We are not interested in it.	Ba ma sha'awar shi ba.
We can't do that yet.	Ba za mu iya yin hakan ba tukuna.
Here are two.	Ga guda biyu.
But she knows there is no point in continuing that.	Amma ta san babu wani amfani a ci gaba da hakan.
The man came into the world.	Mutumin ya zo duniya.
We called for happiness.	Mun yi kira don lokacin farin ciki.
That should be the case.	Haka ya kamata ya kasance.
He took her home.	Ya kai ta gida.
Or is it outside.	Ko akwai a waje.
I know him by himself.	Na san shi daga kansa.
But he finds that he does not want to know.	Amma ya gano cewa baya son sani.
Everyone can see that.	Kowa na iya ganin haka.
Now, get in here.	Yanzu, shiga nan.
Just tell me which one you like.	Kawai gaya mani wanda kuke so.
I can't wait to reuse it.	Ba zan iya jira don sake amfani da shi ba.
Let me see.	Bari in ga haka.
There is nothing new about the food.	Babu wani sabon abu game da abincin.
So you lie.	Don haka ku yi karya.
The amount of hot water in the world is amazing.	Yawan ruwan zafi a duniya yana da ban mamaki.
I love this moment.	Ina son wannan lokacin.
It's just fun.	Abin farin ciki ne kawai.
It's good.	Yana da kyau.
She went out.	Ta fita.
One person is healthy, one person is not.	Mutum daya yana da lafiya, mutum daya ba ya.
No, it is not.	A'a ba haka bane.
She can answer that.	Ta iya amsa wannan.
Yet no one we know so little.	Amma duk da haka babu wanda muka sani kadan.
Tomorrow will be a sad day.	Gobe ​​zai zama ranar bakin ciki.
Nothing and no one.	Babu komai kuma babu kowa.
Easily and quickly captured.	Sauƙi da sauri kama.
Change things up a little bit.	Canza abubuwa sama kadan.
You have to make it work.	Dole ne ku sanya shi aiki.
I know girls like her.	Na san 'yan mata kamar ta.
I don't want to be anymore.	Ba na son zama kuma.
We worked together.	Mun yi aiki tare.
Run, run, run.	Gudu, gudu, gudu.
There is not much that can be done about this problem.	Babu wani abu da yawa da za a iya yi game da wannan matsala.
But definitely amazing.	Amma tabbas ban mamaki.
I understood what she was telling me before she said it.	Na fahimci abin da take gaya mani tun kafin ta ce.
They will not find a place to run.	Ba za su samu inda gudu ba.
Please find another way.	Da fatan za a nemi wata hanya.
Stop doing that.	A daina yin hakan.
He fell into the water.	Ya fada cikin ruwa.
It is useless now.	Ba ya da wani amfani a yanzu.
We have a man on the water, on the water.	Muna da wani mutum a kan ruwa, a kan ruwa.
Now nothing.	Yanzu babu komai.
It’s cold, but not cold.	Yana da sanyi, amma ba sanyi ba.
How to keep women at home.	Na yadda ake ajiye mata gida.
There she was.	Can ta kasance.
I can get there easily.	Zan iya isa wurin da sauƙi.
Be smart and come out.	Ka kasance mai hankali ka fito.
This is also true here.	Wannan ma gaskiya ne a nan.
I have no problem with it.	Ba ni da matsala da shi.
He even cried.	Kuka ma ya kasa yi.
Probably never.	Wataƙila ba za mu taɓa yi ba.
It's just fun to see.	Abin farin cikin gani ne kawai.
I’ve never found that to work well.	Ban taɓa samun hakan ya yi aiki da kyau ba.
You are one and you are all one.	Kun kasance cikin ɗaya kuma kun kasance cikin su duka.
And in an uncomfortable way too.	Kuma a cikin ba ma dadi hanya ma.
Try it hard.	Gwada sosai.
It was wrong then and it is wrong now.	Ba daidai ba ne a lokacin kuma kuskure ne yanzu.
Something made me do that.	Wani abu ya sanya ni yin haka.
But you should imitate him.	Amma ya kamata ku yi koyi da shi.
Once a month.	Sau ɗaya a wata.
Go out into the world, see.	Fita cikin duniya, a gani.
Do, do, work.	Yi, yi, aiki.
I love you, everything.	Ina son ku, komai.
Just keep fighting.	Kawai ci gaba da ci gaba da fada.
You can take one at any gas station.	Kuna iya ɗaukar ɗaya a kowace tashar mai.
Is something going on?	Akwai wani abu da ke faruwa?
How long has that been the case.	Tun yaushe hakan ya kasance.
He cries out because he has no one.	Ya yi kuka, don ba shi da kowa.
I think I should add more sleep or something.	Ina tunanin in kara barci ko wani abu.
That never gave me a problem.	Wannan bai taba ba ni wata matsala ba.
Whatever makes them comfortable.	Duk abin da ya sa su dadi.
We will not get there until we start looking this way.	Ba za mu isa wurin ba har sai mun fara kallon wannan hanyar.
So, this is not something that surprised me.	Don haka, wannan ba wani abu ne da ya ba ni mamaki ba.
They can also make a living.	Suna kuma iya sa kuɗin aiki.
I do not like it.	Ba na son shi.
Man is good.	Mutum yana da kyau.
Life takes time.	Rayuwa tana ɗaukar lokaci.
It does not break the mind.	Ba ya karya hankali.
They work really hard.	Suna aiki da gaske.
Well, you know.	Da kyau, kun sani.
I hated that thought.	Na ƙi wannan tunanin.
Maybe we are making a mistake.	Wataƙila muna yin kuskure.
Nothing good has ever been done before.	Ba a taɓa yin wani abu mai kyau haka ba.
Some people are walking.	Wasu mutane suna tafiya.
Everyone played.	Kowa ya yi wasa.
This is nothing new.	Wannan ba sabon abu ba ne.
She knew but still did not know.	Ta sani amma duk da haka bata sani ba.
I won’t get it anyway.	Ba zan samu ta wata hanya ba.
What time is it now?	Menene lokaci yanzu?
It was a surprise to me.	Abin mamaki ne a gare ni.
You see we can get another.	Za ku ga za mu iya samun wani.
Anyone can see anyone.	Kowa na iya ganin kowa.
It looked funny.	Ya yi kama da ban dariya.
We got time.	Mun samu lokaci.
No, we can't help you.	A'a, ba za mu iya taimaka muku ba.
Honestly the road to this place should be taken.	Gaskiya ya kamata a dauki hanyar zuwa wannan wuri.
So just get bigger.	Don haka kawai kara girma.
The better it is, the higher you get.	Mafi kyawun shi ne, mafi girma da kuke samu.
I just read it, of course.	Na karanta shi kawai, ba shakka.
They left early today.	Sun tashi da wuri yau.
We have no way of knowing.	Ba mu da hanyar sani.
Maybe he still doesn’t remember you.	Watakila har yanzu bai tuna ku ba.
Nor did he think so.	Haka kuma bai yi tunani ba.
Women do not recommend things.	Mata ba sa shawarar abubuwa,.
I have never lost anyone close to me.	Ban taɓa rasa wanda yake kusa da ni ba.
I know such a person.	Na san irin wannan mutumin.
Play it.	Wasa da shi.
I have never done such a thing.	Ban taba yin irin wannan abu ba.
He walked backwards.	Ya yi tafiya a baya.
However, we did not worry.	Duk da haka, ba mu damu ba.
He can always fix himself.	Koyaushe zai iya gyara kansa.
I have a problem	Na sami matsala
I won't even try.	Ba zan ma gwada ba.
And that costs money.	Kuma hakan yana ɗaukar kuɗi.
I did so.	Na yi haka.
You always think about how simple things can be used.	Kullum kuna tunanin yadda za a iya amfani da abubuwa masu sauƙi.
Everything happened so fast.	Komai ya faru da sauri.
Others were killed.	Wasu kuma an kashe su.
It can speak the way in or out of something.	Yana iya magana hanyar shiga ko fita daga wani abu.
I just brought them back, you know.	Na dawo da su ne kawai, ka sani.
But we will recognize it.	Amma za mu gane shi.
There is no money there.	Babu kudi a can.
I do not like.	Ba na so.
I have not decided.	Na yanke shawarar ba.
She could not understand why she felt that way.	Ta kasa gane dalilin da yasa take jin haka.
Nothing like this happened to me before the book was published.	Babu irin wannan abu da ya faru da ni kafin a buga littafin.
That's why we need to go now.	Shi ya sa muke bukatar mu tafi yanzu.
No one even spoke.	Ba wanda ko yayi magana.
That does nothing.	Wannan ba ya yin komai.
That should have happened years ago.	Kamata ya yi hakan ya faru shekaru da suka gabata.
You are better than that.	Ka fi wannan.
We can drink.	Za mu iya sha.
Like she'll get it.	Kamar zata samu shi.
And what should you do !.	Kuma me ya kamata ku!.
There is nothing you can do.	Babu abin da za ku iya yi.
I am the soul.	Ni ne rai.
We are not afraid.	Ba mu da tsoro.
She sent for him.	Ta aika a kira shi.
Please, just no.	Don Allah, a'a kawai.
Prove the truth, please !.	Tabbatar da gaskiya, don Allah!.
We started getting there.	Mun fara isa can.
It’s not just about me.	Ba game da ni kawai ba.
It's very intelligent.	Yana da matukar hankali.
One train took off at two, one at three.	Jirgin kasa daya ya tashi a biyu, daya a uku.
He kind of falls into that.	Ya irin fada cikin haka.
There will be a lot of travel.	Za a yi tafiya mai yawa.
You can not remove it.	Ba za ku iya cire shi ba.
But it is.	Amma haka yake.
Nice to see you again!	Abin farin cikin sake ganin ku!
This may not work.	Wannan ba zai iya aiki ba.
She did not return home.	Bata dawo gida ba.
I, too, cannot accept this!	Ni ma, ba zan iya yarda da wannan ba!
If you like it, great.	Idan kuna son shi, mai girma.
I take time every day to do it.	Ina ɗaukar lokaci kowace rana don yin shi.
I hate that.	Na ƙi cewa.
We will talk about that later.	Za mu yi magana game da shi a gaba.
I really hope it is a good read.	Ina fatan gaske karatu ne mai kyau.
So, we are convinced.	Saboda haka, mun tabbatar.
Then she came back to us.	Sai ta koma gare mu.
He raised his hand to his knee.	Ya daga hannu zuwa gwiwa.
I have to call.	Dole na kira.
It's too long.	Tsawon sa ya kai .
Food may wait.	Abinci na iya jira.
Nothing like this has ever happened.	Babu irin wannan abu da ya faru.
We love you here.	Muna son ku a nan.
It's hard.	Yana da wuya.
Sorry about the rod.	Yi hakuri game da sanda.
We understand that you need help with your problem right now.	Mun fahimci cewa kuna buƙatar taimako game da matsalar ku a yanzu.
It will stop at the end.	Zai tsaya a ƙarshe.
I really don't know what's going on with me.	A gaskiya ban san abin da ke faruwa da ni ba.
When she returned home.	Lokacin da ta dawo gida.
But not all of them are true.	Amma ba duka gaskiya ba ne.
Dinner was missed again.	An sake rasa abincin dare.
She said everything, exactly everything.	Ta fada komai, daidai komai.
I didn’t start working with you for the money.	Ban fara aiki da ku ba don kuɗin.
So he got a chance.	Don haka ya samu dama.
It's a pleasure.	Abin farin ciki ne.
And no, it doesn't work anyway.	Kuma a'a, ba ya aiki ta wata hanya.
It is time to move on to the next thing.	Lokaci ya yi da za a ci gaba zuwa abu na gaba.
We do not know.	Ba mu sani ba.
The idea just fits one thing.	Tunanin kawai yayi daidai da abu ɗaya.
But it really does.	Amma da gaske yana yi.
It feels like there is no good answer.	Ji yayi kamar babu amsa mai kyau.
Others have done the most.	Sauran sun yi mafi yawa.
That may never happen.	Wataƙila hakan ba zai taɓa faruwa ba.
So is this boat.	Haka wannan jirgin ruwa yake.
When they arrived.	Lokacin da suka isa.
To me, it was wrong.	A gare ni, ba daidai ba ne.
I can even recognize it here.	Zan iya ma gane shi a nan.
People come every day.	Mutane suna zuwa kowace rana.
She wanted to continue in the world.	Ta so ta ci gaba a duniya.
He did everything right.	Ya yi komai da kyau.
The easy way you have each other.	Hanya mai sauƙi da kuke da juna.
There is such a joy, such a feeling here.	Akwai irin wannan farin ciki, irin wannan jin dadi a nan.
It should go to me.	Ya kamata ya tafi gare ni.
That's all you have to do.	Shi ke nan ku yi.
Any drinks for the road?	Wani abin sha don hanya?
He is there.	Yana can.
They are also women.	Su kuma mata.
They think it is time for us to talk.	Suna tsammanin lokaci ya yi da za mu yi magana.
Anyone who has anything with this should go.	Duk wanda ke da wani abu da wannan sai ya tafi.
It is not enough to open it.	Bai isa ya bude ba.
Too often this too will break.	Da yawa wannan kuma zai karya.
Be very happy.	Ku yi farin ciki sosai.
I continued.	Na ci gaba.
Let it hurt.	Bari yayi zafi.
It can be scary too.	Yana iya zama mai ban tsoro kuma.
He was not the one who killed her.	Ba shi ne ya kashe ta ba.
He stopped and died.	Sai ya tsaya ya mutu.
You look amazing.	Ka ga ban mamaki.
But you are safe now.	Amma kana lafiya yanzu.
Now let's sleep.	Yanzu bari mu yi barci.
Why she stopped.	Dalilin da yasa ta daina.
But, okay, right? '	Amma, ya yi, daidai?'.
See what we do.	Ganin abin da muke yi.
They make the world a wonderful place to see.	Suna sa duniya ta zama wuri mai ban sha'awa na gani.
One day, not that day.	Wata rana, ba wannan ranar ba.
But they are not enough.	Amma ba su isa ba.
One person can change the world.	Mutum ɗaya zai iya canza duniya.
Let him prove himself.	Bari ya tabbatar da kansa.
He knows how.	Ya san yadda.
It is water.	Ruwan ruwa ne.
But she loved him as much as he loved her.	Amma ta so shi kamar yadda yake so.
Some are just married, you know.	Wasu kuma kawai aure, ka sani.
It was a great joy.	Wani babban farin ciki ne.
You can have a good night's sleep from now on.	Za ku iya yin barci mai kyau daga yanzu.
I never heard that again.	Ban sake jin haka ba sai.
I still eat sweets.	Har yanzu ina cin abubuwa masu dadi.
I stopped thinking.	Na daina tunani.
Let's see what happens.	Bari mu ga abin da ya faru.
Almost but not really.	Kusan amma ba sosai ba.
In fact, it does not make me do anything.	A gaskiya, ba ya sa in yi wani abu.
And he lost nothing.	Kuma bai rasa komai ba.
They were all arrested.	Sai da aka kama su duka.
But so familiar.	Amma haka saba.
You will continue to do so.	Za ku ci gaba da hakan kuma.
And then he heard.	Kuma sai ya ji.
So it is not for me.	Don haka babu shi a gare ni.
He seemed to be going down.	Ya yi kamar zai koma kasa.
But you have to understand.	Amma dole ku gane.
But it is not difficult.	Amma ba wuya ba.
The others are not here.	Sauran ba su nan.
You do not know the world.	Ba ku san duniya ba.
That's what it is.	Shi ne abin da yake.
If you were, it wouldn't be.	Idan kai ne, ba zai kasance ba.
Change back to the person.	Canza koma ga mutum.
I always study there.	Kullum ina yin karatu a can.
After a while the laughter ended.	Bayan wani lokaci dariya ta kare.
She did something she knew she could not do.	Ta yi wani abu da ta san ba za ta iya yi ba.
You did not get it.	Ba ku samu ba.
We look at this as follows.	Muna duba wannan kamar haka.
No work, no money.	Babu aiki, babu kudi.
The car is full.	Motar ta cika.
But it is still very tasty.	Amma har yanzu yana da daɗi sosai.
Anyone who sees fear.	Duk wanda ya ga tsoro.
Suddenly I felt amazing.	Nan da nan na ji ban mamaki.
He has to bring it back.	Dole ne ya dawo da shi.
He will be able to do a good job.	Zai sami damar yin aiki mai kyau.
I'm really sorry.	Na yi hakuri da gaske.
It has not rained for two years.	Shekara biyu ba a yi ruwan sama ba.
He was not sure what he planned.	Bai tabbatar da me ya shirya ba.
They were so delicious.	Sun kasance masu dadi sosai.
He does not have much money.	Ba shi da kuɗi da yawa.
Maybe they are going that way.	Watakila suna tafiya ta wannan hanyar.
I'll start from the beginning.	Zan fara daga farko.
She will never eat it again.	Ita ma ba za ta ƙara ci ba.
He suffers so much overall.	Yana shan wahala sosai gaba ɗaya.
She shouldn't have said it, she knew.	Bai kamata ta fada ba, ta sani.
She has grown so much.	Ta yi girma sosai.
I really like the place.	Ina matukar son wurin.
This person has no money.	Wannan mutumin ba shi da kudi.
We do not know tomorrow.	Ba mu san gobe ba.
I did not tell you.	Ban gaya muku ba.
But let's not stop there.	Amma kada mu tsaya a nan.
But this did.	Amma wannan ya yi.
He certainly disliked it.	Lallai ya ƙi shi.
She is not sure if she can.	Ba ta da tabbas ko za ta iya.
I am not right.	Ni gaskiya ba.
Don't miss it !.	Kar ku rasa shi!.
Come and know it.	Ku zo ku san shi ne.
Everyone is trying to figure it out.	Kowa yana ƙoƙari ya gane shi.
So, you have.	Don haka, kuna da .
You probably know a lot about them.	Da alama kun san abubuwa da yawa game da su.
I know how you feel.	Na san yadda kuke ji.
Maybe he also got up and did something useful.	Wataƙila kuma ya tashi ya yi wani abu mai amfani.
Maybe that's all there is to it.	Wataƙila wannan shine duk wani abu na wannan.
Wait while driving.	Jira lokacin tuƙi.
Yet he does not like it.	Amma duk da haka baya son sa.
They all wondered what she was going to say.	Duk suka yi mamakin me zata ce.
They will give me this.	Za su ba ni wannan.
We will be here for you always.	Za mu kasance a nan don ku koyaushe.
It is a call or a drink.	Kira ne ko abin sha.
Many people around the world have done just that.	Mutane da yawa a kusa da nan sun yi hakan.
He knew things better.	Ya kara sanin abubuwa.
I really like this book.	Ina matukar son wannan littafin.
I have everything.	Ina da komai.
That will not change.	Hakan ba zai canza ba.
But first, let me tell you why we came here.	Amma da farko, bari in gaya muku dalilin da ya sa muka zo nan.
Or they may die.	Ko kuma su mutu.
We have to keep it up now.	Dole ne mu ci gaba da shi a yanzu.
I still have no answer.	Har yanzu bani da sauran amsa.
I know you do what you can.	Na san kuna yin abin da za ku iya.
We will do the same.	Za mu yi daidai da haka.
It still seems really, really sad.	Har yanzu da alama da gaske, kusan bakin ciki.
Not now, maybe not anymore.	Ba yanzu, watakila ba kuma.
He studied hard but did not succeed.	Yayi karatu sosai amma bai samu nasara ba.
Now you know what to call it.	Yanzu kun san abin da za ku kira shi.
He is still making a lot of money.	Har yanzu yana samun kuɗi mai yawa.
The flight is on time.	Jirgin yana kan lokaci sosai.
I looked for a good place to fish.	Na duba don neman wuri mai kyau don yin kifi.
How much more work do you want to do?	Nawa ƙarin aiki kuke son yi?
But that is not what happened here.	Amma ba haka ya faru a nan ba.
I'll give it a go.	Zan ba shi tafi.
It was easy this way.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi ta wannan hanya.
Now, think for a moment.	Yanzu, yi tunani na ɗan lokaci.
The man did not sit down.	Mutumin bai zauna ba.
But you know he was called to fight.	Amma ka san an kira shi ya yi fada.
I still can't believe it.	Har yanzu na kasa yarda.
They had a good time together, at first.	Sun yi jin daɗi tare, da farko.
They are not very numerous.	Ba su da yawa sosai.
I did not see.	Ban gani ba.
If they can't, they can't.	Idan ba za su iya ba, ba za su iya ba.
That made her happy.	Hakan ya mata dadi.
Really back to again.	Da gaske baya zuwa kuma.
There is nowhere to run.	Babu inda za a gudu.
He has no money.	Ba shi da kudi.
It is good to see you again.	Yana da kyau in sake ganin ku.
We are not finished with what to say.	Ba mu gama gama abin da za mu faɗa ba.
And what he did to me.	Kuma abin da ya yi mini.
He thought he was wrong.	Yayi tunanin kuskure.
We will be in the second.	Za mu kasance a cikin na biyu.
I love them and I miss them.	Ina son su kuma na rasa su.
They will get more work in the future.	Za su sami ƙarin aiki a gaba.
You wouldn’t do that, would you?	Ba za ku yi haka ba, ko?
If you know one, you are winning.	Idan kun san daya, kuna nasara.
Not exactly delicious, but it is home.	Ba daidai ba dadi, amma gida ne.
But that is unlikely to happen.	Amma da wuya hakan ya faru.
That time has passed.	Wannan lokacin ya wuce.
It's a beautiful sight.	Wani kyakkyawan gani ne.
We do not want to be late.	Ba ma so mu makara.
That can lead to loss.	Hakan na iya sa mutum ya rasa.
Ask him.	Ka tambaye shi.
This should not take too long.	Wannan bai kamata ya ɗauki lokaci mai yawa ba.
We have to prepare for that.	Dole ne mu shirya hakan.
She told me to go and put them in the car.	Ta ce in je in saka su cikin mota.
It started.	Ya fara.
All the more so than we know when you are going to die.	Duk fiye da yadda muka san lokacin da za ku mutu.
Often as you wish.	Sau da yawa yadda kuke so.
I personally love it that way.	Ni da kaina ina son shi ta wannan hanya.
This is definitely not the time to bring it up.	Lallai wannan lokacin bai dace a kawo shi ba.
Which is not too much for him.	Wanda hakan bai yi masa yawa ba.
I should stop.	Ya kamata in daina.
I can see so much.	Ina iya ganin haka da yawa.
That would be an easier way than that.	Da hakan ya kasance hanya mafi sauƙi daga gare ta.
They don’t have to be runners to make good money.	Ba dole ba ne su kasance masu gudu don samun kuɗi mai kyau ba.
It was clear, at this point, that it was true.	Ya tabbata, a wannan lokacin, cewa yana da gaskiya.
I have one more.	Ina da daya kuma.
But you have to find the right time.	Amma dole ne ku sami lokacin daidai.
No more '.	Babu kuma'.
But it doesn’t have to be him.	Amma bai kamata ya kasance shi ba.
It is nothing.	Shi ba komai ba ne.
Either way, sometimes just hot.	A wata hanya, wani lokacin zafi ne kawai.
It is growing rapidly.	Tana girma da sauri.
Give them to us.	Ka ba mu su.
I don’t know exactly how to start.	Ban san ainihin yadda zan fara ba.
Please do not!	Don Allah kar!
I hope it can be me.	Ina fata zai iya zama ni.
The boat is coming!	Jirgin ruwa yana zuwa!
He decided to print it safely.	Ya yanke shawarar buga shi lafiya.
She was not happy.	Ba ta ji daɗi ba.
I tried each one.	Na gwada kowane daya.
You have to give everything.	Dole ne ku ba da komai.
I still look like a kid.	Har yanzu ina kama da yaro.
You can save money.	Kuna iya ajiye kuɗi.
You will never make a mistake with this.	Ba za ku taɓa yin kuskure da wannan ba.
They tried everything they could think of.	Sun gwada duk abin da za su iya tunanin.
Mu ma.	Mu ma.
I began to see.	Na fara gani.
Progress is good.	Ci gaba yana da kyau.
Now he feels uncomfortable.	Yanzu ya ji babu dadi.
When he stopped, they stopped.	Da ya tsaya suka tsaya.
That's the end of it.	Karshen sa kenan.
We could not do anything to bring him back.	Ba mu iya yin komai don dawo da shi ba.
He was skinned.	An yi masa fata.
It was lifted.	Aka daga ta.
He knew he had to get used to it.	Ya san ya kamata a saba da hakan.
He knows you are a hard worker.	Ya san kai mutum ne mai yawan aiki.
I watch him go there every day.	Ina kallon yadda yake zuwa wurin kowace rana.
You will never be trusted correctly.	Ba za a taɓa yarda da ku daidai ba.
He wants them to have what comes to them.	Yana son su sami abin da ke zuwa gare su.
I never said it would happen that day.	Ban taba cewa zai faru a wannan ranar ba.
He opened the door and entered.	Ya bude kofar ya shiga.
But use them carefully.	Amma yi amfani da su a hankali.
But he failed.	Amma ya kasa.
But now we see how you say it.	Amma yanzu mun ga yadda kuke fada.
Not often.	Ba sau da yawa ba.
You love it, you use it.	Kuna son shi, kuna amfani da shi.
We can not do that here.	Ba za mu iya yin hakan a nan ba.
But because he was right.	Amma saboda ya yi gaskiya.
I totally agree with that.	Na yarda da hakan gaba ɗaya.
Stop, man.	Ka tsaya, mutum.
I know now you have no way.	Na san a yanzu ba ku da hanyar.
And years of work.	Kuma shekaru na aiki.
Hopefully that fits.	Da fatan hakan yayi daidai.
Years later.	Bayan shekaru.
And you have to pay them in advance.	Kuma dole ne ku biya su a gaba.
He felt like a god.	Ya ji kamar allah.
We want you to hear at home.	Muna son ku ji a gida.
This is how it really works.	Wannan shine yadda yake aiki da gaske.
He will not forget you.	Ba zai manta da ku ba.
No, it is true.	A'a, gaskiya ne.
As it is.	Kamar yadda yake.
I don’t know if he knew.	Ban sani ba ko ya sani.
He was almost killed on the road but nothing.	Kusan an kashe shi akan hanya amma ba komai.
He was in great debt.	Ya kasance cikin bashi sosai.
She never came.	Ba ta taba zuwa ba.
I like to take things and make them really.	Ina son ɗaukar abubuwa da sanya su gaske.
However, it always works.	Duk da haka, yana aiki koyaushe.
I feel weird about it.	Na ji ban mamaki game da shi.
Now do it again.	Yanzu sake yi.
But, you know, you don't have to accept everything you hear.	Amma, ka sani, bai kamata ka yarda da duk abin da ka ji ba.
Save will be in your name.	Ajiye zai kasance cikin sunan ku.
Work and wait.	Aiki da jira.
Yet it was not.	Amma duk da haka ba ta kasance ba.
What is not clear to me yet is how to do it internationally.	Abin da bai bayyana a gare ni ba tukuna shine yadda za a yi kasa da kasa.
Everyone knows that heavy smoking kills people.	Kowa ya san cewa yawan shan taba yana kashe mutane.
Go ahead please, go ahead.	Ci gaba don Allah, ci gaba.
Let's make money.	Bari mu sami kudi.
Something that is rejected, rejected, rejected.	Wani abu da aka ƙi, ƙi, ƙi.
How to recognize the past.	Yadda za a gane abin ya wuce shi.
You two are amazing and you fit in perfectly.	Ku biyu masu ban mamaki ne kuma kun dace da juna.
But that doesn't matter.	Amma hakan ba komai.
Not sure, but get out ?.	Kasa tabbas, amma fita?.
I will take you to a place where there will be a way forward.	Zan kai ku wani wuri inda za a sami hanyar gaba.
She was about to run into a car.	Ta kusa karo da mota.
How many years have you worked here?	Shekaru nawa ka yi aiki a nan?
She could not pass them.	Ba za ta iya wuce su ba.
I did not think about it.	Ban yi tunani game da shi ba.
He had seen the man before but could not make it.	Ya taba ganin mutumin a baya amma ya kasa sanya shi.
It was off and on all day.	An kashe kuma a duk rana.
Progress has been made.	An ci gaba da ci gaba.
He can be honest.	Zai iya yin gaskiya.
It has been a great tool for us.	Ya zama kayan aiki sosai a gare mu.
No, it can not be.	A'a, ba zai iya zama ba.
They hate each other.	Sun ƙi juna.
Sometimes we make mistakes, but we keep going.	Wani lokaci muna samun kuskure, amma muna ci gaba.
And he was.	Kuma ya kasance.
Help me.	Taimake ni.
Let me tell you a clue.	Bari in gaya muku wata alama.
It is a.	Yana da a.
But it is still not close.	Amma har yanzu bata kusa ba.
I told him the story.	Na ba shi labarin.
He was passionate about everything.	Ya kasance mai sha'awar komai.
No one knows for sure.	Babu wanda ya san tabbas.
He came, he saw, he died.	Ya zo, ya gani, ya mutu.
I brought it.	Na kawo shi.
I thought something about it didn’t work out.	Na yi tunanin wani abu game da shi bai yi kyau ba.
I want to run upstairs	Ina son gudu sama
He was more than happy with her.	Ya fi jin daɗi da ita.
There is no one like you in the whole world.	A duk duniya ba za a taɓa samun wani kamar ku ba.
We just want to talk to you.	Muna son yin magana da ku kawai.
He was right.	Yayi gaskiya.
It happened a lot.	Ya faru da yawa.
There seems to be no way out.	Kamar babu abin yi sai ci gaba.
I have nothing.	Ba ni da komai.
We women are talking.	Mu mata muna magana.
It did not last long.	Bai dade a haka ba.
And that is not good.	Kuma hakan bai yi kyau ba.
Now, get up slowly.	Yanzu, tashi a hankali.
We can use them at the same time.	Za mu iya amfani da su a lokaci guda.
He received many answers.	Ya sami amsa da yawa.
The above article was published over the weekend.	An buga labarin da ke sama a karshen mako.
I will.	zan yi.
It appears that the name of this doctor precedes him.	Ya bayyana cewa sunan wannan likitan ya riga shi.
But that is what it is.	Amma shi ne abin da yake.
Then she killed him.	Sai ta kashe shi.
Now is the time to start planning.	Yanzu ne lokacin fara shirin.
Such talk is dead.	Irin wannan magana ta mutu.
She would have just come.	Da ma ta zo kawai.
Exactly how all this works is still being discovered.	Daidai yadda duk wannan ke aiki har yanzu ana gano shi.
There is only one place we can go.	Wuri ɗaya ne kawai za mu iya zuwa.
Must be completed.	Dole ne a cika.
I told you next week.	Na gaya muku mako mai zuwa.
Hope you like it.	Da fatan kuna son shi.
Tell her she's better.	Ka gaya mata cewa ta fi kyau.
I can wait until tomorrow.	Zan iya jira har gobe.
He can do this.	Zai iya yin wannan.
And the boy was happy.	Kuma yaro yayi dadi.
He was around.	Ya kasance a kusa.
Nothing right now.	Ba komai yanzu haka.
I was happy to do it.	Na yi farin ciki da yin shi.
She comes in and opens the door and walks past.	Tana zuwa ta bude kofar ta wuce.
Others feel the same way.	Wasu kuma suna jin haka.
This is a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne.
I passed.	na wuce.
It has never been well used.	Ba a taɓa samun amfani mai kyau da shi ba.
We kind of got involved.	Mun irin shiga ciki.
It's like they're killing each other.	Kamar suna kashe juna.
But he does not have that.	Amma ba shi da wannan.
It does not require much water.	Ba ya buƙatar ruwa da yawa.
I was injured.	Na ji rauni.
I can't let it go.	Ba zan iya barin shi ya tafi ba.
How many people live.	Mutane nawa ne suke rayuwa.
Cold water works fine.	Ruwan sanyi yana aiki lafiya.
Much has changed.	Da yawa sun canza.
I might	na yi
It's another way.	Wata hanya ce.
I still do not understand.	Har yanzu ban gane ba.
This train however has a sleeping car.	Wannan jirgin kasa duk da haka yana da motar barci.
I can't figure it out though.	Ba zan iya gane shi ba ko da yake.
In the end it will not be enough.	A ƙarshe ba zai isa sosai ba.
She will be happy.	Za ta yi farin ciki.
It looks like.	Ya yi kama da da.
It was definitely a mistake.	Babu shakka lokacin kuskure ne.
He grew bigger.	Ya girma girma.
He drank coffee.	Ya sha kofi.
Of course, it's good.	Tabbas, yana da kyau.
For one.	Na daya.
I think they are good.	Ina tsammanin suna da kyau.
She played music even.	Ta buga waƙa ko da.
Shall we.	Mu je.
But you say.	Amma kuna fada.
They love kids.	Suna son yara.
Drink plenty of water every day.	Sha ruwa mai yawa kowace rana.
She drank a lot of coffee, but not much.	Ta sha kofi da yawa, amma ba ta da yawa.
If the article finds you, turn it off.	Idan labarin yana samun ku, kashe shi.
I'm glad we didn't.	Na ji dadi ba mu yi ba.
I am not the only one who wants to die.	Ba ni kadai suke son mutu ba.
No one is eating.	Babu wanda ke cin abinci.
It still works.	Har yanzu yana aiki.
They did so much more than that.	Sun yi haka da yawa fiye da haka.
It turned out to be funny.	Sai ya zama mai ban dariya.
You are not around.	Ba ku kasance a kusa ba.
The same should be done on that, but are we? 	Haka kuma ya kamata a yi aiki a kan haka, amma shin mu?
no.	a'a.
But stay with me here.	Amma tsaya tare da ni a nan.
It gets a good ending.	Yana samun kyakkyawan ƙarshe.
You see, they didn't leave school.	Ka ga, ka ga ba su bar makaranta ba.
I felt like running.	Na ji kamar gudu.
Now this is my favorite story of the week.	Yanzu wannan shine labarin da na fi so na mako.
If it is true they must call for help.	Idan gaskiya ne dole su kira taimako.
See if the three of you can help each other.	Ku duba ko ku uku za ku iya taimakon juna.
I don't want to live again.	Ba na son sake zama.
They kill each other again.	Suna sake kashe juna.
It must.	Dole ne.
Rejoice that you are taking your time.	Yi farin ciki da cewa kuna ɗaukar lokacin ku.
She has no money.	Ba ta da kuɗi.
However, nothing is instantaneous.	Duk da haka, babu abin da ke nan take.
Do not go into the water.	Kada ku shiga cikin ruwa.
She seems to love the house.	Da alama tana son gidan.
Something like that must have happened.	Wani abu kamar shi tabbas ya faru.
We will tell him what we want him to do.	Za mu gaya masa abin da muke so ya yi.
At the same time he felt he had to move on.	A lokaci guda ya ji dole ya ci gaba.
I'm sure that's what you think.	Na tabbata abin da kuke tunani ke nan.
I'll fix it in the morning.	Zan gyara shi da safe.
She made a big mistake.	Ta yi babban kuskure.
They would not even expect this.	Ba za su ma yi fatan wannan ba.
Tell you what.	Ku gaya muku menene.
What's the matter.	Akwai matsala.
Suffice it to say a lot.	Ya isa ya ce da yawa.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
I told him not to think of doing that.	Na ce masa kada ya yi tunanin yin hakan.
Really and really.	Gaske na gaske kuma na gaske.
Then something happened.	Sai wani abu ya faru.
I find a good place for us.	Ina samun wuri mai kyau a gare mu.
Can we leave it at that?	Za mu iya barin shi a haka?.
I never suspected anything.	Ban taba zargin komai ba.
I don't see what she would be happy about.	Ban ga abin da za ta yi farin ciki da shi ba.
Many people enjoy eating fish	Mutane da yawa suna jin daɗin cin kifi
But it was a hot trip.	Amma tafiya ce mai zafi.
But everything was a great stay.	Amma duk abin ya kasance babban zama.
Now we are on to something.	Yanzu mun kasance kan wani abu.
You may or may not agree with this.	Kuna iya ko ba za ku yarda da wannan ba.
So, let me explain.	Don haka, bari in bayyana.
All you have to do is wait.	Duk abin da za ku yi shi ne jira.
Go ahead, hot stuff.	Ci gaba, kayan zafi.
They have it coming, of course. 	Suna da shi zuwa, tabbas. 
I want to be able to swim	Ina so in kara yin iyo
Maybe you forgot how to fish.	Wataƙila kun manta yadda ake kifi.
It makes everyone better.	Yana sa kowa ya fi kyau.
One thing is for sure.	Abu daya tabbata.
It's a big fish.	Babban kifi ne.
We are safe.	Muna lafiya.
It should be in a.	Ya kamata ya kasance a cikin a.
Some think that this is too much.	Wasu suna tunanin hakan ya yi yawa.
Some will give a little.	Wasu za su ba da kadan.
And you are inside.	Kuma kuna ciki.
I didn’t expect you to start it early.	Ban yi tsammanin za ku fara shi da wuri ba.
I never felt she was happy at all.	Ban taba jin tana farin cikin komai ba.
Things will get better next week.	Abubuwa za su yi kyau mako mai zuwa.
Enjoy every good dinner.	Ji daɗin kowane abincin dare lafiya.
After a while she spoke.	Bayan wani lokaci ta yi magana.
He spent three years there.	Ya yi shekara uku a can.
No people.	Babu mutane.
And we can.	Kuma za mu iya.
She didn't feel well.	Ba ta ji dadi ba.
Sometimes that's what you want.	Wani lokaci abin da kuke so ke nan.
The name is beautiful!	Sunan suna da kyau!
This is for sure.	Wannan tabbas.
He had to return home.	Sai da ya dawo gida.
Yes, the time of marriage, and children.	Haka ne, lokacin aure, da yara.
I still enjoy everything.	Har yanzu ina jin daɗin komai.
Eat slowly or your food is cold.	Ku ci a hankali ko abincin ku ya yi sanyi.
Maybe they made a mistake.	Wataƙila kuskure ne da suka yi.
With that.	Da cewa.
I looked at the rest.	Na duba sauran.
He caught them unawares.	Ya kama su ba tare da sun sani ba.
Then a man came out of the house.	Sai wani mutum ya fito daga gidan.
It's good, she said.	Yana da kyau, in ji ta.
We will miss him.	Za mu rasa shi.
But no doubt there was someone in the house.	Amma babu shakka akwai wani a gidan.
They will never eat or sleep.	Ba za su taɓa ci ko barci ba.
I'll be back.	Zan dawo.
The meal will take time.	Abincin zai ɗauki lokaci.
But sometimes, you never know.	Amma wani lokacin, ba ku sani ba.
I know for sure.	Na san hakan tabbas.
It must have upset you.	Dole ne ya bata maka rai.
I want to test if something will come out of it.	Ina so in gwada idan wani abu zai fito daga ciki.
There was something in the room that made me nervous.	Akwai wani abu a cikin dakin da ya sa ni tsoro.
Maybe, she thought.	Wataƙila, ta yi tunani.
Let's go back.	Mu koma baya.
It will go on with life.	Za a ci gaba da rayuwa.
I spent three days there.	Na yi kwana uku a can.
But still failed.	Amma duk da haka ya kasa.
I have no way of knowing.	Bani da hanyar sani.
Not like anything else.	Ba kamar kowane abu ba.
This is a great game.	Wannan babban wasa ne.
In fact they do, all the time.	A gaskiya suna yi, duk lokacin.
Or another job.	Ko wani aiki kuma.
I am not accepted.	Ba a yarda da ni ba.
She will be very focused at this point on her next attempt.	Za ta kasance mai da hankali sosai a wannan lokacin akan ƙoƙari mai zuwa.
I wish there were more like you.	Da ma an samu irin ku.
She was ready to leave.	Ta shirya zata tafi.
You cannot release it at that time.	Ba za ku iya sake shi ba a lokacin.
I left you.	Na bar ku.
How it is.	Yadda yake.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
I am a human being	Ni mutum ne
She knew what he was talking about.	Ta san abin da yake fada sosai.
The movie is more interesting.	Fim ɗin ya fi ban sha'awa.
I showed her.	Na nuna mata.
I can say that it was even later.	Zan iya cewa shi ne ko da daga baya.
And just what happened was really good.	Kuma kawai abin da ya faru ya yi kyau sosai.
There are many women in the world.	Akwai mata da yawa a duniya.
The dress is three years old.	Rigar tana da shekara uku.
Stop here.	Tsaya nan.
We started walking together.	Muka fara tafiya tare.
Which is not good.	Wanda ba shi da kyau.
She was very nice and happy.	Ta kasance mai matukar kyau da farin ciki.
That's how we succeed.	Haka muke samun nasara.
Maybe these did not come right.	Wataƙila waɗannan ba su zo daidai ba.
She knew exactly what she wanted.	Ta san ainihin abin da take so.
Anyway, buy this book.	Ko ta yaya, saya wannan littafin.
It will make life easier.	Zai sa rayuwa ta fi sauƙi.
Make two calls.	Yi kira biyu.
It will change your mind.	Zai canza tunanin ku.
Maybe now is the time.	Wataƙila yanzu shine lokacin.
This makes things easier.	Wannan ya sa abubuwa sun fi sauƙi.
She ate her lunch and quickly left.	Ta ci abincin rana da sauri ta tafi.
He is not the person you are going to play with.	Shi ba mutumin da za ku yi wasa da shi ba.
Or you.	Ko kai.
I decided this would be a quick fix.	Na yanke shawarar wannan zai zama gyara mai sauri.
You can get out of the way or you can fall.	Kuna iya fita daga hanya ko za ku iya fada.
It can get many, very big.	Yana iya samun yawa, girma sosai.
A happy child is a healthy child.	Yaro mai farin ciki yaro ne mai lafiya.
I have never forgotten that decision.	Ban taba manta wannan shawarar ba.
And so it will be.	Kuma haka abin zai kasance.
He wanted to stay.	Ya so ya zauna.
Put this on.	Saka wannan.
I will marry him, no matter what people say.	Zan aure shi, ko da me mutane suka ce.
Or here.	Ko kuma a nan.
No one can know.	Babu wanda zai iya sani.
And always to make an effort to do so.	Kuma ko da yaushe don yin ƙoƙari don yin hakan.
That we cannot do.	Wannan ba za mu iya yi ba.
So she would talk.	Don haka za ta yi magana.
But it seems interesting so far.	Amma ga alama mai ban sha'awa ya zuwa yanzu.
He thought it would make him money.	Ya yi tunanin zai sa masa kudi.
Or so he thinks.	Ko haka yake tunani.
Twice so many times, in fact.	Sau biyu da yawa haka, a gaskiya.
The fast food restaurant is here.	Gidan cin abinci mai sauri ya kasance a nan.
He hoped so.	Ya yi fatan haka.
They want to be able to be something they want or anyone.	Suna son iya zama wani abu da suke so ko kowa.
Better ahead of the game.	Gara a gaba da wasan.
Do this only once, and never again.	Yi wannan sau ɗaya kawai, kuma kada a sake.
I got out of everything.	Na fita daga komai.
He should do it himself.	Kamata yayi da kansa yayi.
I can't see why.	Ba zan iya ganin dalilin ci gaba ba.
She thought about it.	Ta yi tunani a kai.
They started giving things away.	Sun fara ba da abubuwa.
I have no way of reaching it.	Ba ni da wata hanyar da zan kai shi.
Nothing.	Ba komai ba.
He decided to tell her everything.	Ya yanke shawarar zai gaya mata komai.
I read it.	Na karanta shi.
But still he did not get it.	Amma duk da haka bai samu ba.
He didn't care much.	Bai damu sosai ba.
Not even close.	Ba ma kusa ba.
Third cup, please!	Kofi na uku, don Allah!
At this point it will not help.	A wannan lokacin ba zai taimaka ba.
I love it from travel.	Ina son shi daga tafiya.
She is always with me too.	Kullum tana tare da ni kuma.
He hit a little on his own.	Ya buga kadan da kansa.
It's your place.	Wurin ku ne.
They just want to live.	Suna son rayuwa ne kawai.
In fact, it is amazing.	A gaskiya ma, abin mamaki ne.
It doesn't matter.	Bata damu ba.
All of these are described there.	Duk waɗannan an bayyana su a can.
Didn't anyone tell you to be careful?	Ba wanda ya ce ku yi hankali?
This was a surprise to me.	Wannan ya zama mini ban mamaki.
He would not say.	Ba zai ce ba.
He is more talkative.	Ya fi magana.
I will try it over the weekend.	Zan gwada shi a karshen mako.
No one was found there.	Ba a sami kowa a wurin ba.
I think it's a big effort.	Ina tsammanin babban ƙoƙari ne.
Or trying to be.	Ko ƙoƙarin zama.
See.	Ku gani.
But he is not.	Amma ba ya.
However it is thought to be the best solution.	Duk da haka an yi tunanin mafi kyau a yi aiki.
You guys made the best second attempt.	Ku mutane sun yi mafi kyawun ƙoƙari na biyu.
The drink tasted so good.	Abin sha ya yi mata dadi sosai.
It is not difficult.	Ba shi da wahala.
I understand that this was.	Na fahimci cewa wannan ya kasance.
So he will not drink.	Don haka ba zai sha ba.
You will sit and see it.	Za ku zauna ku gani gare ta.
So you know this has to be real.	Don haka ka san dole ne wannan ya zama da gaske.
God is cold.	Allah yayi sanyi.
Just check if this works for you.	Kawai duba idan wannan yana aiki a gare ku.
Take care of all expenses.	Kula da duk abubuwan kashe kuɗi.
Not mine, but close to me.	Ba nawa bane, amma na kusa da ni.
I would never want anything like that.	Ba zan taɓa son wani irin wannan ba.
I'm not sure if there is anything I can get.	Ban tabbata ko akwai abin da zan samu ba.
Truth! 	Gaskiya!
They never left.	Ba su taɓa barin ba.
People here make more money	Mutane a nan suna samun ƙarin kuɗi
Many others.	Wasu da yawa.
I have met him before.	Na hadu da shi a baya.
And we can talk about that a little bit.	Kuma za mu iya yin magana game da hakan kadan kadan.
He went.	Ya tafi.
We can not be sure.	Ba za mu iya tabbata ba.
He was right.	Ya yi gaskiya.
The day will be hot.	Ranar za ta yi zafi.
About one o'clock in the morning.	Kusan ɗaya na safe.
I looked at my right man.	Na kalli mutumin dama na.
And, besides, she is tired of running.	Kuma, ban da haka, ta gaji da gudu.
But nothing can really prepare you.	Amma babu abin da zai iya shirya ku sosai.
No errors were shown.	Ba a nuna kuskure ba.
Not the only way.	Ba hanya kadai ba.
You can't come close to it, no matter who you are.	Ba za ku iya zuwa kusa da shi ba, ko da wanene ku.
Probably not.	Wataƙila bai kamata ba.
Or maybe in the past.	Ko watakila a baya.
So that's what we got.	Don haka abin da muka samu ke nan.
It is useful.	Abu ne mai amfani.
Almost once a week for a year.	Kusan sau ɗaya a mako har tsawon shekara.
Completely open.	Gaba daya ya bude.
He said he would come, but he did not get it.	Ya ce zai zo, amma bai samu ba.
But it is a close call.	Amma kira ne na kusa.
I was surprised no one heard it.	Na yi mamaki ba wanda ya ji shi.
She pointed to the door.	Ta nuna kofar.
It felt really good.	Ya ji dadi sosai.
Close the door.	A rufe kofar.
You do not cry.	Ba ku kuka.
Funny comedy, really.	Abin ban dariya mai ban dariya, gaskiya.
They were walking down the road.	Sun kasance suna tafiya zuwa hanyar.
It feels safe.	An ji lafiya.
They don't really care about you.	Ba su damu da ku sosai ba.
Only here.	Sai a nan.
I got it right.	Na sami daidai.
Or because they do.	Ko saboda suna yi.
In fact, this is the first step.	A gaskiya, wannan ita ce hanya ta farko.
I have no problem with it.	Ban samu matsala da shi ba.
Now, the rest of us do too.	Yanzu, sauran mu ma muna yi.
I would have known better.	Da na fi sani.
We do not need to be afraid.	Bai kamata mu ji tsoro ba.
The police are there now.	'Yan sanda suna can yanzu.
You will be fine.	Za ku kasance lafiya.
Sometimes, it just takes time.	Wani lokaci, hakan yana ɗaukar lokaci kawai.
But there is something wrong with being dishonest to yourself.	Amma akwai wani abu ba daidai ba tare da rashin gaskiya ga kanku.
Or they say we tried to touch them or something.	Ko kuma su ce mun yi ƙoƙari mu taɓa su ko wani abu.
Let her do it.	Bari ta yi.
Go home if they need you.	Ku tafi gida idan suna buƙatar ku.
Try both and not there.	Gwada duka biyu kuma ba a can ba.
He stood next to her and she was happy.	Sai da ya tsaya kusa da ita sai ta yi farin ciki.
He does not see the familiar.	Ba ya ganin saba.
She didn't expect that from me.	Ba ta yi tsammanin haka daga gare ni ba.
She was sure she liked it.	Ta tabbata ta so shi.
The train is moving slowly.	Jirgin yana tafiya a hankali.
We feel good when we do things.	Muna jin dadi idan muka yi abubuwa.
I should be something.	Ya kamata in zama wani abu.
But it just doesn’t happen.	Amma ba kawai faruwa ba.
She said it was something she should have done.	Ta ce wani abu ne ya kamata ta yi.
Now look.	Yanzu ya duba.
I thought of taking it.	Na yi tunanin dauka.
That did not happen.	Hakan bai faru ba.
We will be home next year.	Za mu kasance gida shekara mai zuwa.
Fortunately, the program did not succeed.	Abin farin ciki, shirin bai yi nasara ba.
I definitely went to school.	Lallai na tafi makaranta.
Within a week, they were something.	A cikin mako guda, sun kasance wani abu.
Or even a month.	Ko ma wata daya.
Great and very tasty.	Mai girma da dadi sosai.
Just everyone shouts.	Kawai kowa yayi kara.
I never talked about it.	Ban taba magana a kai ba.
He could not stop laughing.	Ya kasa daina dariya.
It is also difficult.	Ita ma ke da wuya.
Don't use me.	Kada ku yi amfani da ni.
Not a big surprise, that.	Ba babban abin mamaki ba, cewa.
That's what it says.	Abin da aka fada ke nan.
You should call the police.	Ya kamata ku kira 'yan sanda.
It doesn't matter.	Bata damu ba.
For a moment we looked at each other.	Na dan lokaci muna kallon juna.
He wants that.	Yana son hakan.
It can be good.	Yana iya zama mai kyau.
But he left nothing behind.	Amma bai bar abubuwa a wurin ba.
Some say you write what you know.	Wasu suna cewa ka rubuta abin da ka sani.
I don't even know why.	Bata ma san dalilin yin hakan ba.
Every day, horrible things happen in the world.	Kowace rana, abubuwa masu ban tsoro suna faruwa a duniya.
No problem.	Me babu matsala.
It can be cold and scary.	Zai iya zama sanyi da tsoro.
They are the best in the world.	Su ne mafi kyau a duniya.
He has no such thing.	Ba shi da irin wannan abu.
He failed to say he already did.	Ya kasa cewa ya riga ya yi.
So we're going to do something really big.	Don haka za mu yi wani abu mai girma sosai.
Whatever she wanted.	Ko menene hakan ta so.
But now you have to take care of it.	Amma yanzu dole ne ku kula da shi.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
But she got a chance to think.	Amma ta samu damar yin tunani.
I have been asked about it a lot.	An tambaye ni game da shi da yawa.
It really was.	Da gaske ya kasance.
He likes to travel in time.	Yana son tafiya cikin lokaci.
Everyone cares about them.	Kowa ya damu da su.
Very good stuff.	Abubuwa masu kyau sosai.
We have to tell the police.	Dole ne mu gaya wa 'yan sanda.
Who is another.	Wanene wani.
You called it.	Kun kira shi.
The same thing happened.	Haka ma an yi.
He tried to take care of me.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya kula da ni.
She seemed to have nothing.	Ta yi kamar ba ta da komai.
But let me tell you this.	Amma bari in gaya muku wannan.
I will definitely be back next year !.	Tabbas zan koma shekara mai zuwa!.
I want to know what they are.	Ina so in san menene su.
You are the second best.	Kai ne na biyu mafi kyau.
There is another one you need to see.	Akwai wani kuma da kuke buƙatar gani.
I can't do that.	Ba zan iya yin hakan ba.
Yet others do.	Amma duk da haka wasu suna yi.
Three years of marriage.	Shekara uku da aure.
But no one really knows what to do with it.	Amma babu wanda ya san abin da zai yi da shi.
So it will be faster.	Don haka zai yi sauri.
Some things were working.	Wasu abubuwa sun kasance suna aiki.
Leave people alone.	Bar mutane kawai.
It's a kind of laugh.	Wata irin dariya ce.
It is time to get back on track.	Lokaci ya yi da za a dawo kan hanya.
It's just time.	Lokaci ne kawai.
Not often, how.	Ba sau da yawa, ta yaya.
I don’t think it will be a big event.	Ba na jin zai zama babban taron.
You certainly should not drink too much.	Lallai bai kamata ku sha da yawa ba.
But this is still good.	Amma wannan har yanzu yana da kyau.
I made things.	Na sanya abubuwa.
The man cut it.	Mutumin ya yanke shi.
She made a noise at the door.	Ta yi wata kara a bakin kofar.
See if this works for you.	Duba ko wannan yana aiki a gare ku.
Horrible things are happening to everyone.	Abubuwa masu ban tsoro suna faruwa ga kowa da kowa.
As you will make the best film you can.	Kamar yadda za ku yi fim mafi kyau da kuke iya.
That's what's happening.	Abin da ke faruwa kenan.
Less selfish.	Kasa da rashin son kai.
It's a waste of time.	Bata lokaci ne.
I'm sure he doesn't sleep well.	Na tabbata ba ya barci yadda ya kamata.
I want to see what happens.	Ina so in ga abin da zai faru.
I can’t go into the past or see the future.	Ba zan iya shiga abin da ya gabata ko ganin gaba ba.
Stop wasting time!	A daina bata lokaci!
I love this festival !.	Ina son wannan bikin!.
Please continue the article.	Da fatan za a ci gaba da labarin.
A little bit of something as he wants.	Kadan na wani abu kamar yadda yake so.
I do not understand why he would say no.	Ban gane dalilin da yasa zai ce a'a ba.
Once, they are just like any other.	Sau ɗaya, suna ne kamar kowane.
If there is anything you.	Idan akwai wani abu ku.
She was amazing.	Ta kasance abin mamaki.
Everything is fine.	Komai yayi kyau.
I'll even take you there.	Zan ma kai ku can.
It can make him much bigger.	Yana iya yi masa yawa girma.
I think this will go down.	Ina tsammanin wannan zai koma kasa.
They took of course.	Sun dauka ba shakka.
And we have to do something about your name.	Kuma dole ne mu yi wani abu game da sunan ku.
He made himself so.	Ya sanya kansa haka.
Many people do not eat in a week.	Mutane da yawa ba su ci abinci a cikin mako guda ba.
So anyone can imagine.	Don haka kowa zai iya tunanin.
No, we are not talking about it.	A'a, ba mu yi magana game da shi ba.
It is not the way.	Ba hanya ba ce.
They do this every year.	Suna yin haka duk shekara.
She knows how to make people happy.	Ta san yadda za ta sa mutane su ji daɗi.
I will leave you, if you will.	Zan bar ku, in kuna so.
No one can do that anymore.	Babu wanda zai iya yin hakan kuma.
I do not know when she will return.	Ban san lokacin da zata dawo ba.
I will never let that happen.	Ba zan taba barin hakan ta faru ba.
He is afraid of you.	Ya ji tsoron ku.
Like you said, no one would know he was there.	Kamar yadda ka ce, babu wanda zai san yana can.
See, all of this should never happen.	Duba, wannan duka bai kamata ya faru ba.
If you stay.	Idan kun zauna.
He could have said that she wanted to add.	Ya iya cewa tana son ta kara cewa.
It's interesting	Yana da ban sha'awa
I joined them.	Na shiga su.
We have to go.	Dole ne mu tafi.
When the sun comes up, get up.	Da rana ta fito, ka tashi.
He will not tell us anything.	Ba zai gaya mana komai ba.
I want to get up and run.	Ina so in tashi da gudu.
Some will know, but not many.	Wasu za su sani, amma ba da yawa ba.
It is a lot of work.	Aiki ne mai yawa.
We prepared lunch and left for school.	Muka shirya abincin rana muka tashi zuwa makaranta.
This is amazing.	Wannan abin ban mamaki ne.
Slowly he entered the restaurant.	A hankali ya shiga gidan abinci.
There is no reason to do it here.	Babu dalilin yin shi a nan.
This is the last one.	Wannan shi ne na karshen.
I returned home after work.	Na dawo gida bayan na yi aikin.
They are not afraid.	Ba sa jin tsoro.
I do not know what to say.	Ban san abin da zan ce ba.
What could be better!?.	Me zai fi kyau!?.
I never joined.	Ban taɓa shiga ba.
I am the only person who knows what it is.	Ni mutum ne kawai wanda ya san menene.
But now they are working together very well.	Amma yanzu suna aiki tare sosai.
You know what you did.	Kun san abin da kuka yi.
I will take care of you if you become ill.	Zan kula da ku idan kun yi rashin lafiya.
You can take them.	Kuna iya ɗaukar su.
Do not let anyone know you are here.	Kar ka bari kowa ya san kana nan.
While there, read it.	Da yake can, karanta shi.
This guy just did something to him.	Wannan mutumin ya yi masa wani abu kawai.
So we can be better.	Don haka za mu iya zama mafi kyau.
We need to talk.	Muna bukatar magana.
They should be able to help you.	Ya kamata su iya taimaka maka.
Either way, he did it right.	A wata hanya, ya yi daidai.
I decided to bring it back.	Na yanke shawarar dawo da shi.
I can't live on my own.	Ba zan iya rayuwa da kaina ba.
If you do not sell it should.	Idan ba ka sayar da shi ya kamata.
One is to go buy it later.	Daya shi ne ka je ka saya daga baya.
Then she realized what it was.	Sai ta gane me yake.
Seriously, look at it now.	Da gaske, kalli shi a yanzu.
I do not understand why they would do that.	Ban gane dalilin da ya sa za su yi haka ba.
I really like that.	Ina matukar son hakan.
That goes for this song.	Wannan ya tafi ga wannan waƙa.
She told him she would check.	Ta fada masa zata duba.
This dress is amazing.	Wannan rigar tana da ban mamaki.
It will hurt her.	Zai yi mata wahala.
Let me start.	Bari in fara.
I think you know her.	Ina tsammanin kun san ta.
We have known him for a while.	Mun san shi na ɗan lokaci.
But just like that.	Amma kamar haka.
You feel a sharp pain.	Ka ji zafi mai zafi.
Or maybe both.	Ko watakila duka biyu.
We still do not agree.	Har yanzu ba mu yarda ba.
Do what you think is right.	Yi abin da kuke ganin daidai ne.
She just wants to play with me.	Ita kawai tana son ta yi wasa da ni.
With it, you never knew.	Tare da shi, ba ku taɓa sani ba.
No good thoughts.	Babu kyakkyawan tunani.
Stop lying to me.	Ka daina yi min karya.
It takes time, they say.	Yana ɗaukar lokaci, in ji su.
She knew they were somewhere.	Ta san suna nan wani wuri.
It’s good on everything.	Yana da kyau a kan komai.
More than now, even more so.	Fiye da yanzu, har ma fiye da haka.
You are all tired.	Ku duka kun gaji.
But no one knows that.	Amma ba wanda ya san haka.
Of course he would recommend it to everyone.	Tabbas zai ba da shawarar ta ga kowa.
I watched the ground progress.	Na kalli kasa ta ci gaba.
But that did not come as a surprise.	Amma sai, hakan bai zo da mamaki ba.
We need to call it.	Muna bukatar mu kira shi.
And it can be very scary if that happens.	Kuma yana iya zama mai ban tsoro sosai idan wannan ya faru.
I remember hearing that.	Na tuna jin haka.
It is time to move on.	Lokaci ya yi da za a tafi yanzu.
How wonderful and wonderful, she thought.	Yaya ban mamaki da ban mamaki, ta yi tunani.
It seems.	Ga alama.
And she understood.	Kuma ta gane.
She was walking.	Ta kasance tafiya.
She should be accustomed to this idea.	Kamata yayi ta saba da wannan tunanin.
He can do anything.	Yana iya yin komai.
Maybe he killed someone.	Wataƙila ya kashe wani.
Do this well.	Yayi wannan da kyau.
It was an amazing time.	Lokaci ne na ban mamaki.
Can you tell me the day it will work for you.	Kuna iya gaya mani ranar da za ta yi muku aiki.
This however will be shown below.	Wannan duk da haka za a nuna a kasa.
We kept doing it.	Muka ci gaba da yi.
We saw the first and the second.	Mun ga na farko da na biyu.
I feel everyone is gone.	Ina jin duk wanda ya tafi.
They should be covered.	Ya kamata a rufe su.
What he feels and thinks.	Abin da yake ji da tunani.
And maybe he can.	Kuma watakila ya iya.
I used to feel like I had to finish almost everything.	Na kasance ina jin dole in gama kusan komai.
No, he did not tell anyone.	A'a, bai gaya wa kowa ba.
But then no.	Amma sai babu.
Definitely a favorite.	Tabbas abin da aka fi so.
There is no entry.	Babu hanyar shiga kawai.
She begins to cry.	Ta fara kuka.
They will never do anything.	Ba za su taɓa yin wani abu ba.
But it is easy.	Amma abu ne mai sauƙi.
Only a handful of people did that.	Kadan ne kawai na mutane suka yi haka.
Sure better than the others, but still not good.	Tabbas mafi kyau fiye da sauran, amma har yanzu ba kyau.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
Let's put it this way.	Mu sanya shi kamar haka.
But it will not come.	Amma ba zai zo ba.
But he will learn to speak in time.	Amma zai koyi magana cikin lokaci.
She is not a plaintiff.	Ita ba mai kara ba ce.
It doesn't seem to matter.	Da alama ba komai.
I have already written it three times.	Na riga na rubuta shi sau uku.
At least she acted like a genius.	Ko kadan ta yi kamar mai hankali.
But no one felt like me from beginning to end.	Amma babu wanda ya ji kamar ni daga farko har ƙarshe.
I love them both.	Ina son su duka biyu.
They can not help you.	Ba za su iya taimaka muku ba.
I'll call him today.	Zan kira shi yau.
I don't think it's appropriate.	Ina ganin bai dace da hakan ba.
No one traveled at night during the cold season.	Babu wanda ya yi tafiya da dare a lokacin sanyi.
I love him only if he does that.	Ina son shi ne kawai idan ya yi haka.
Please call me at.	Don Allah a kira ni a.
I went to work that day.	Na tafi aiki a ranar.
A good way.	Hanya mai kyau.
She says now is not the time.	Ta ce yanzu ba lokaci ba ne.
I don't want to tell anyone.	Ban so in gaya wa kowa.
And for me.	Kuma a gare ni.
I don't care.	Bani komai.
She was a rising star.	Ta kasance mai tashi da wuri.
I will stay and do nothing.	Zan zauna ban yi komai ba.
But then you come.	Amma sai ka zo.
He does a lot of that kind of thing.	Yana yin irin wannan abu da yawa.
Everything is happening now.	Komai yana faruwa yanzu.
She decided to renovate the room.	Ta yanke shawarar gyara dakin.
It shows you how you are not involved.	Yana nuna maka yadda ba ka da hannu.
No one did, however.	Babu wanda ya yi, duk da haka.
It felt like rain.	Ta yi daidai kamar ruwan sama.
I want you to help me.	Ina so ku taimake ni.
You got it.	Ka samu.
Spend time, he said.	Kashe lokaci, ya ce.
We talked about that.	Mun yi magana game da wannan.
He tried to call me.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya kira ni.
I will change, if you will.	Zan canza, idan kuna so.
I'll keep this outside.	Zan ajiye wannan waje.
Besides, she didn't believe it was.	Ban da haka, ba ta yarda cewa yana da ba.
She never wanted to.	Ba ta taba so ba.
You have to give it one.	Dole ne ku ba shi daya.
The problem is global, not local.	Matsalar ta duniya ce, ba na gida ba.
Everyone knows that.	Kowa ya san haka.
I have nowhere to go for help.	Ba ni da inda zan koma neman taimako.
Do not lie and say no.	Kar ka yi karya ka ce ba ka yi ba.
Harassment.	Dama.
And we want to talk to you.	Kuma muna so mu yi magana da ku.
It appears that this attempt was not made.	Ya bayyana cewa ba a yi wannan ƙoƙarin ba.
Not because he is.	Ba don shi ne ba.
You know better.	Kun fi sani.
Do not let anyone use it.	Kada ka bari wani ya yi amfani da shi.
You can do something like this.	Kuna iya yin wani abu kamar wannan.
And you will be there.	Kuma za ku kasance a can.
You will hear them easily.	Za ku ji su cikin sauƙi.
Who could write such a thing?	Wanene zai iya rubuta irin wannan?
But now, here you are.	Amma yanzu, ga ku kuma.
Real attention.	Hankali na gaske.
These can be scary.	Waɗannan na iya zama masu ban tsoro.
However it is not the only problem.	Duk da haka ba shine kawai matsala ba.
Nothing really happened.	Babu wani abu da ya faru da gaske.
I catch them.	Ina kama su.
After that it is now.	Bayan haka ne yanzu.
It was a beautiful weekend.	Ya kasance kyakkyawan karshen mako.
We must write two.	Dole ne mu rubuta biyu.
You certainly know it.	Lallai kun san shi.
He would have been killed.	Da an kashe shi.
Everything we do is wrong.	Duk abin da muke yi kuskure ne.
The game is up.	Wasan ya tashi.
Life.	Rayuwa.
Or write to me.	Ko kuma rubuta min.
Maybe they will help.	Wataƙila za su taimaka.
Someone might have said he was surprised.	Da ma wani ya ce ya yi mamaki.
We were almost a year old.	Mun kasance kusan shekaru ɗaya.
Just right for me.	Dama kawai na.
Maybe that could be something.	Wataƙila hakan zai iya zama wani abu.
He drinks water before every meal.	Yana shan ruwa kafin kowane abinci.
No one agreed.	Babu wanda ya yarda da shi.
She is not alone.	Ba ita kaɗai ba.
The room is very comfortable.	Dakin yayi dadi sosai.
They have a very good reputation.	Suna da suna sosai.
We just looked at each other.	Kallon juna kawai muka yi.
There is no job for you there.	Babu aiki a gare ku a can.
They said they met in the library.	Sun ce sun hadu a dakin karatu.
So, that's fine.	Don haka, hakan yana da kyau.
There is one of us.	Akwai wani daga cikin mu.
They get what they need from each other.	Suna samun abin da suke bukata a cikin juna.
If there is one place there may be others.	Idan akwai wuri ɗaya za a iya samun wasu.
I am just a human being.	Ni mutum ne kawai.
We almost stopped eating.	Mun kusa daina abinci.
It’s hard, watching as you go.	Yana da wuya, kallon yadda kuka tafi.
He will go with you if you will.	Zai tafi tare da ku idan kun so.
After a while they decided to sell them.	Bayan wani lokaci suka yanke shawarar sayar da su.
Yet it was in the past, it seems.	Amma duk da haka ya kasance a baya, da alama.
She tried them all.	Ta gwada su duka.
It's good.	Yana da kyau.
You have a decision to make.	Kuna da shawarar da za ku yanke.
We do not understand this.	Ba mu fahimci wannan ba.
Things are growing fast.	Abubuwa suna girma cikin sauri.
What to eat.	Abin da za a ci.
I really like it.	Ina matukar son sa.
I sit on the floor.	Ina zaune a kasa.
This year he walked out of nowhere.	A wannan shekara ya yi tafiya daga babu.
This is something that no one wants to do.	Wannan wani abu ne da ba wanda yake son yi.
He will hear you.	Zai ji ku.
For now we will move on.	Don yanzu za mu ci gaba.
You die instantly.	Ka mutu nan take.
And now it is completely forgotten.	Kuma yanzu an gama an manta.
Another great job.	Wani babban aiki.
It is simply unacceptable.	Ba abin yarda ba ne kawai.
You have to be smart.	Ya kamata ku kasance masu hankali.
You will never know what you will get!	Ba za ku taɓa sanin abin da za ku samu ba!
It's a good thing.	Abu ne mai kyau.
I like the name very much.	Ina son sunan sosai.
I know it's cold.	Na san ya yi sanyi.
She was honest.	Ta kasance mai gaskiya.
Tonight.	Daren yau.
I know so.	Na san haka ne.
I didn’t think we would.	Ban yi tsammanin za mu yi ba.
Before we got to know each other, we rarely talked.	Kafin mu fara sanin juna, ba mu cika yin magana ba.
But, it is still difficult.	Amma, har yanzu yana da wuya.
Immediately.	Nan take.
No one told me to go.	Babu wanda ya ce in tafi.
I acted like I was laughing.	Na yi kamar ina dariya.
We will just do that.	Za mu yi haka kawai.
Maybe she was right.	Wataƙila ta yi gaskiya.
It's like a game.	Kamar wani irin wasa ne.
No one is visible.	Babu kowa a gani.
I was just thinking.	Tunani nake kawai.
There is also something external.	Akwai kuma wani abu na waje.
In fact, it is very difficult.	A gaskiya ma, yana da matukar wahala.
I have to get everything right.	Dole ne in sami komai daidai.
I love it more than anything in the world.	Ina son shi fiye da komai a duniya.
But he is getting there.	Amma yana zuwa can.
She has to defend.	Dole ta kare.
He knew what he had to do.	Ya san abin da dole ne ya yi.
He would not mind being cold.	Ba zai damu da zama mai sanyi ba.
There is something wrong.	Akwai wani abu da ba daidai ba.
Women love it.	Mata sun so shi.
And up.	Kuma sama.
Removed now.	An cire shi yanzu.
The events are still happening.	Abubuwan da suka faru har yanzu suna faruwa.
I am fine	Ina lafiya
It's been heard a lot, though.	An ji da yawa, ko da yake.
Of course I do not agree with some of these.	Tabbas ban yarda da wasu daga cikin waɗannan ba.
This made him feel unworthy.	Hakan ya sa shi jin rashin sanin ya kamata.
The car is still.	Motar har yanzu ita ce.
This has been very successful.	Wannan ya yi nasara sosai.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
Seating time still.	Lokacin zama har yanzu.
But I was scared.	Amma tsoro ya kama ni.
You are amazing.	Kun yi ban mamaki.
Not women.	Ba mata ba.
I'm sure you will want to be with me.	Na tabbata za ku so zama tare da ni.
He is crying.	Yana kuka.
She was a little surprised, but not surprised.	Ta dan yi mamaki, amma ba mamaki.
And not because of what he was doing to her.	Kuma ba don abin da yake yi mata ba.
The story is over.	An gama labarin.
That seems too good to be true.	Wannan da alama yayi kyau ya zama gaskiya.
I'd like to see it released.	Ina so in ga an sake shi ma.
I do not mind.	Ban damu ba.
She knew it, like sleep had told her.	Ta san haka, kamar barci ya gaya mata.
Be honest about what you think will sell.	Kasance mai gaskiya game da abin da kuke tunanin zai sayar.
You can see everything from there.	Kuna iya ganin komai daga can.
They will try to talk to me to help them.	Za su yi ƙoƙari su yi magana da ni don in taimake su.
So they stayed there, in the water, in our water.	Don haka suka zauna a can, cikin ruwa, cikin ruwan mu.
I wonder if he will succeed.	Ina sha'awar ko zai yi nasara.
Maybe it still came empty.	Wataƙila har yanzu ya zo ba komai.
But what do you think.	Amma menene tunanin.
You can not help yourself.	Ba za ku iya taimakon kanku ba.
This difficult journey was a good one.	Wannan tafiya mai wahala ta yi kyau.
I want to keep fighting you.	Ina so in ci gaba da yi muku fada.
Go, therefore, this way.	Tafi, saboda haka, ta wannan hanya.
Just wait.	Jira kawai.
It is not easy to leave.	Ba shi da sauƙi don barin.
He immediately realized he had a drinking problem.	Nan da nan ya gane yana da matsalar sha.
It is unclear if this story is true.	Babu tabbas idan wannan labarin gaskiya ne.
He tried to remember what he had read.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya tuna abin da ya karanta.
She had no doubt that the time was right.	Ba ta shakka cewa lokacin gaskiya ne.
So I got involved.	Haka na shiga ciki.
I have come to speak to you.	Na zo nan don yin magana da ku.
I can't work.	Ban iya aiki ba.
We have to pay for it, of course.	Dole ne mu biya ta, ba shakka.
He got it.	Ya samu.
Take you to a restaurant.	A kai ku gidan cin abinci.
The black stuff is gone.	Bak'in kayan sa ya tafi.
I want to be with them.	Ina son zama tare da su.
I’m good for girls to like me.	Ina da kyau ga 'yan mata su so ni.
The movie is going to be scary.	Fim ɗin zai zama mai ban tsoro.
This is correct.	Wannan daidai ne.
We are still busy.	Har yanzu muna kan aiki.
But still he was worried.	Amma duk da haka ya damu.
You do not really know what it is about yet.	Ba ku da gaske sanin abin da yake game da shi tukuna.
It started almost a year ago.	An fara kusan shekara guda da ta wuce.
I don't remember any food or water we were given.	Ba na tuna abinci ko ruwa ake ba mu.
There are so many both in common.	Akwai da yawa duka biyu a cikin kowa.
The rest of us are just trying to keep going.	Sauran mu muna ƙoƙarin ci gaba ne kawai.
I worked with her.	Na yi aiki da ita.
We wanted to see that happen.	Mun so mu ga hakan ya faru.
Who are they?	Su wa ne?
However you need to do some work.	Duk da haka kuna buƙatar yin wani aiki.
From sad to happy.	Daga bakin ciki zuwa farin ciki.
He does too.	Shi ma yana yi.
He found the door.	Ya sami kofar.
Not much of a head.	Ba da yawa na kai.
We spent the night on the beach.	Muka kwana a bakin ruwa.
He would not just do it.	Ba zai yi kawai ba.
She does it every year.	Ta yi shi kowace shekara.
Try changing the skin.	Gwada canza fata.
I love her.	Ina son ta.
It looks so good.	Ya yi kyau sosai.
He told him to wait for one.	Ya gaya masa ya jira daya.
Water supply.	Ruwan ruwa.
We swam close to each other for a while.	Muka yi iyo kusa da juna na ɗan lokaci.
Of course she did not hear me.	Tabbas ba ta ji ni ba.
Nothing of theirs was heard again.	Ba a sake jin wani abu na kowane mutum ba.
I could not recognize him.	Ba zan iya gane shi ba.
He knows everything.	Ya san komai.
Get out of the way.	Ku tashi daga hanya.
Best, easy, long life.	Mafi kyau, sauƙi, tsawon rai.
We will remove it.	Za mu cire shi.
The second one looks like, just the simplest.	Na biyu yana kama da, kawai mafi sauƙi.
Where is the time back with you.	Inda yake lokacin da baya tare da ku.
Stop here.	Ku tsaya a nan.
It's a matter of water.	Wani abu ne na ruwa.
That is the first thing that happens, but it is not.	Abin da ya fara faruwa kenan, amma ba haka ba.
He wrote it.	Ya rubuta shi.
He was alive.	Ya kasance mai rai.
I tried to laugh with them.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin dariya tare da su.
It is not a difficult thing.	Ba abu ne mai wahala ba.
I said he brought food.	Na ce ya kawo abinci.
You just have to know where to look.	Dole ne kawai ku san inda za ku duba.
She saw what he had done.	Ta ga abin da ya yi.
Just in case you don’t know, it’s not.	Kawai idan ba ku sani ba, ba haka bane.
He was caught in a few things.	An kama shi a cikin 'yan abubuwa.
He did too.	Shi ma ya yi.
He should have known.	Da ma ya sani.
Hope it helps.	Da fatan ya taimaka.
He knew all this before.	Ya san duk wannan a baya.
Everyone really helped.	Kowa ya taimaka sosai.
He stopped working.	Ya daina aiki.
Someone has it.	Wani yana da shi.
Knowing her then he was asked to reveal himself.	Sanin ta sai a tambaye shi ya bayyana kansa.
They use that.	Suna amfani da hakan.
This is the right thing to do.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya dace.
I hope you can read this.	Ina fata za ku iya karanta wannan.
I did not do well in this.	Ban yi kyau a wannan ba.
Anything but this.	Komai sai wannan.
He was sweet.	Ya kasance mai dadi.
But much is unknown.	Amma da yawa ba a sani ba.
But for him it was true.	Amma a gare shi ya zama gaskiya.
I hope you are well.	Ina fatan kuna lafiya.
In the end, only time will tell.	A ƙarshe, lokaci ne kawai zai nuna.
They must be found.	Dole ne a sami su.
They are the only ones women want.	Su kadai ne mata suke so.
You do not have to remember anything.	Ba sai ka tuna komai ba.
Suddenly she felt like she had said it all.	Nan take ta ji kamar ta fada duka.
He told me something funny once.	Ya ce min wani abu mai ban dariya sau ɗaya.
You think of nothing but your food.	Ba ku tunanin komai sai abincin ku.
But it is time for you to work together.	Amma lokaci ya yi da za ku yi aiki tare.
He is just being honest.	Shi mai gaskiya ne kawai.
If they get involved, great.	Idan sun shiga, mai girma.
And this is it.	Kuma wannan shi ne.
If you have to go, just go.	Idan dole ne ku tafi, kawai ku tafi.
How scary that can be.	Yadda hakan zai iya zama abin tsoro.
Buy this book.	Sayi wannan littafin.
Leave that too.	Bar wannan ma.
I gained more confidence in myself.	Na kara yarda da kaina.
No one knows how long we have been there.	Ba wanda ya san tsawon lokacin da muka zo wurin.
And see how no one gives that thought.	Kuma ku ga yadda babu wanda ya ba da wannan tunani.
Please do not say that again!	Don Allah kar a sake cewa!
This was only changed to show a different approach.	An canza wannan kawai don nuna wata hanya.
Maybe he was.	Wataƙila ya kasance.
I will never be afraid again.	Ba zan sake jin tsoro ba.
She let them sit.	Ta bar su zama.
He added.	Ya kara da cewa.
Some people take advantage of the first opportunity they have.	Wasu mutane suna amfani da damar farko da suka samu.
They have no tools for the job.	Ba su da kayan aiki don aikin.
More than two years now.	Sama da shekaru biyu yanzu.
I bought a few things.	Na sayi 'yan abubuwa.
Not there.	Ba a can ba.
And he was just a kid.	Kuma shi yaro ne kawai.
It will not be done later.	Ba za a yi daga baya ba.
That is very interesting.	Hakan yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
I will not worry.	Ba zan damu ba.
One has to let that pass.	Dole ne mutum ya bar hakan ya wuce.
I'm going to drink it.	Zan je in sha shi.
Just to make sure she is touched.	Kawai don ta tabbata an taba ta.
We'll cover a little bit of it.	Za mu rufe kadan daga ciki.
Misconceptions about pleasure.	Ba daidai ba game da jin daɗi.
Do not leave the house when you feel that way.	Kada ku bar gidan lokacin da kuke jin haka.
It's difficult.	Da wuya.
They don't want me to travel yet.	Ba su so in yi tafiya tukuna.
My children too.	Yara na kuma.
I found some of course.	Na sami wasu ba shakka.
Of course, he did not do it alone.	Tabbas, bai yi shi kadai ba.
Why he is talking, he does not know.	Me ya sa yake magana, bai sani ba.
It rained a lot last night.	An yi ruwan sama mai yawa a daren jiya.
We are here.	Mun kasance a nan.
I like these things.	Ina son waɗannan abubuwan.
Do not read too much into it.	Kada ku yi karatu da yawa a ciki.
They will learn it at any time.	Za su koyi shi a kowane lokaci.
This is what makes us humans.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya sa mu mutane.
But it can still be done.	Amma duk da haka ana iya yi.
I walk on this road every day.	Ina tafiya a kan wannan hanya kowace rana.
I would like to go to you.	Zai yi kyau in je wurin ku.
Life is worth living and it is worth living.	Rayuwa tana da amfani kuma tana da amfani.
We need time here.	Muna bukatar lokaci a nan.
So off we went.	Haka muka tafi.
It's a lot.	Yana da yawa.
There is no way she did that.	Babu yadda ta yi hakan.
He owed a lot of money.	Ya bashi kudi mai yawa.
Easy to make and they are beautiful.	Sauƙi don yin kuma suna da kyau.
They say it's cold.	Suna cewa ya yi sanyi.
You will be back.	Za ku dawo.
I said go in.	Na ce ku shiga.
Maybe they even went a month.	Watakila ma sun tafi wata guda.
I can't tell you anything.	Ba zan iya gaya muku komai ba.
I don't care.	Ban damu da shi ba.
It does not happen.	Ba ya faruwa.
The grocery store is looking the other way.	Mai sayar da kayan abinci yana kallon wata hanya.
I can continue to live a happy life.	Zan iya ci gaba da rayuwa ta farin ciki.
We are not even thinking.	Ba ma tunani ba ne.
The food was amazing.	Abincin ya yi ban mamaki.
Keep up the good work.	Ci gaba da aikin ku.
Last night, three times.	Daren jiya, sau uku.
Keep it up.	Ci gaba da shi.
Do you need help with homework?	Kuna son taimako da aikin gida?
Sometimes the best thing to do is to do everything.	Wani lokaci mafi kyawun abin da za a yi shi ne yin komai.
Look at the rest again.	Ku kalli sauran kuma.
It's so delicious.	Abu ne mai daɗi gaske.
He is very sensitive to criticism.	Yana matukar kula da suka.
No one talks about it again.	Babu wanda ya sake yin magana game da shi kuma.
But he wanted them.	Amma ya so su.
It was good to get her back.	Ya yi kyau a dawo da ita.
But not in this way.	Amma ba ta wannan hanyar ba.
But he is there.	Amma yana can.
We want to help you try to grow.	Muna so mu taimake ka ka yi ƙoƙari don girma.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
I think you too.	Ina tsammanin kai ma.
I never thought of that.	Ban taba tunanin hakan ba.
I can be fine.	Zan iya lafiya.
He will surely succeed.	Tabbas zai yi nasara.
I do not expect you to leave.	Ba na fatan ku tafi.
I can't care less about the truth.	Ba zan iya kula da gaskiya ba.
I'm not very interested.	Ba ni da sha'awa da yawa.
Just fill it out.	Cika kawai.
Many users will be able to access it.	Masu amfani da yawa za su iya samun dama ga shi.
I will take care of the rest.	Zan kula da sauran.
He was very weak.	Ya kasance babban rauni sosai.
It works fine in my home.	Yana aiki lafiya a cikin gida na.
He doesn't want to go now.	Bata son ya tafi yanzu.
It's been less than a year.	Ya yi kasa da shekara guda.
So we did not.	Don haka ba mu yi ba.
Interestingly, she is not alone.	Abin sha'awa shine, ba ita kaɗai ba.
It is too hot to sit outside in the sun.	Yana da zafi sosai don zama a waje da rana.
The place they feel at home.	Wurin da suke ji a gida.
He answered that question twice.	Ya amsa da wannan amsa sau biyu.
It is an amazing read.	Karatu ne mai ban mamaki.
He does not have much time.	Ba shi da lokaci mai yawa.
He tried to think of what he could do next.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya yi tunanin abin da zai iya yi a gaba.
It doesn't work anymore.	Ba yadda yake aiki kuma.
However, sometimes it can rain a lot.	Duk da haka, wani lokacin yana iya yin ruwan sama da yawa.
Only one though.	Daya kawai ko da yake.
They can go either way.	Za su iya tafiya ta kowace hanya.
Not as he did.	Ba kamar yadda ya yi ba.
Before anyone could help her die.	Kafin wani ya taimaka mata ta mutu.
When absent it works.	Lokacin da ba ya nan yana aiki.
The work was	Aikin ya kasance
And it is not.	Kuma ba haka ba ne.
We just want to succeed.	Muna son yin nasara ne kawai.
There are no players right now.	Babu 'yan wasa a yanzu.
But that is not your problem.	Amma ba shine matsalar ku ba.
You are better than other people.	Kun fi sauran mutane.
I think it does a really good job.	Ina tsammanin yana yin aiki mai kyau sosai.
And maybe they were right to do so.	Kuma watakila sun yi daidai da yin haka.
We should do that.	Ya kamata mu yi hakan.
And that is what they did.	Kuma abin da suka yi ke nan.
Your kind.	Irin ku.
But she could not run fast.	Amma ta kasa gudu da sauri.
And first of all it is good.	Kuma da farko yana da kyau.
They are better, he thought.	Sun fi kyau, ya yi tunani.
But she has to do it.	Amma dole ta yi haka.
Use "you" when we are talking about a person.	Yi amfani da "kai" lokacin da muke magana game da wani mutum.
The water is back.	Ruwa ya dawo.
Something about them.	Wani abu game da su.
Remember that after you have done it finally.	Ka tuna cewa bayan kun yi shi a ƙarshe.
It is a difficult task.	Aiki ne mai wahala.
He had to move on.	Sai da yayi gaba.
And so it began.	Kuma haka ya fara.
He wrote another.	Ya rubuta wani.
They know where they are.	Sun san inda suka kasance.
That you stay with me.	Da ka zauna da ni.
They decided that someone should work.	Sun yanke shawarar cewa wani ya yi aiki.
I do not want to come.	Ba zan so in zo wurin ba.
We had the most enjoyable time there.	Mun sami lokacin da ya fi jin daɗi a wurin.
Let me ask you somewhere.	Bari in tambaye ku wani wuri.
I confirm that.	Ina tabbatar da hakan.
Imagine if that had never been the case.	Ka yi tunanin idan ba a taɓa buƙatar hakan ba.
Change the game the way you want.	Canza wasan yadda kuke so.
The film is the greatest.	Fim ne mafi girma.
If necessary.	Idan dole.
That sounds good to me.	Hakan yayi min kyau.
It's just true.	Gaskiya ne kawai.
Hopefully people like it.	Da fatan mutane suna son shi .
Closer than we think sometimes.	Kusa fiye da yadda muke tunani wani lokaci.
I can do nothing but live with it.	Ba zan iya yin komai ba sai rayuwa da ita.
As time went on, some started talking.	Lokaci ya ci gaba, wasu sun fara magana.
There is just so much money in it.	Kawai akwai kudi da yawa a ciki.
We would love the opportunity to further explore this.	Za mu so damar da za mu kara duba wannan.
Today, we know many things.	A yau, mun san abubuwa da yawa.
But that cannot be done.	Amma ba za a iya yin haka ba.
Whether they are successful today or not.	Ko sun ci nasara a yau ko a'a.
It's as beautiful as the sun.	Yana da kyau kamar rana.
Not after what they did to me.	Ba bayan abin da suka yi min ba.
They do not die easily.	Ba su mutu da sauƙi.
Not me.	Ba ni ba.
He will be at home in a week.	Zai kasance a gida nan da mako guda.
Thirty years before, perhaps.	Shekaru talatin kafin, watakila.
It may even be necessary.	Yana iya ma zama dole.
This is a difficult journey.	Wannan tafiya ce mai wahala.
They did everything everyone wanted to hear.	Sun yi duk abin da kowa ke son ji.
Play all the time at the same time.	Yi wasa kowane lokaci a lokaci guda.
Now, everyone sees the same thing.	Yanzu, kowa yana ganin abu ɗaya.
And this is not because it is easy.	Kuma wannan ba don yana da sauƙi ba.
Just keep living.	Ci gaba da rayuwa kawai.
She was caught running away.	An kama ta da yin gudu da sauri.
Tonight, too.	A daren yau, ya yi yawa.
False day was made for.	Ranar karya aka yi don.
That is the problem.	Wannan ita ce matsalar.
It is truly amazing.	Lallai abin mamaki ne.
She should just go home.	Yakamata kawai ta tafi gida.
Only the killers must die.	Dole ne kawai masu kashe su mutu.
You have to come with me.	Dole ku zo tare da ni.
Next time, let’s plan lunch here.	Lokaci na gaba, bari mu yi shirin cin abincin rana a nan.
I thought crying.	Na yi tunanin kuka.
That’s how he feels, though.	Shi ne yadda yake ji, ko da yake.
In the end, it is me.	A ƙarshe, ni ne.
But he went on to say nothing.	Amma ya ci gaba da cewa komai.
Some are good.	Wasu suna da kyau.
I don't even remember that.	Ban ma tuna da haka ba.
Call me in a year.	Kira ni a cikin shekara guda.
You talked to him.	Kun yi magana da shi.
They don’t have to look good in it.	Ba dole ba ne su yi kyau a ciki.
For food, or to buy groceries.	Don abinci, ko siyan kayan abinci.
Walk with me.	Yi tafiya tare da ni.
But now they are not here.	Amma yanzu ba su nan.
I will not ask for help or things.	Ba zan nemi taimako ko abubuwa ba.
Today you are inside.	Yau kuna ciki.
This has all been fixed.	Wannan duk an gyara shi.
She, she said nothing.	Ta, ba ta ce komai ba.
Never say never.	Kada a ce taba.
They do.	Suna yin haka.
There is more to the story than that.	Akwai sauran labarin, fiye da ita.
She thought he was dead.	Ta yi tsammanin ya mutu.
She ran into the house, crying.	Da gudu ta shiga gidan tana kuka.
That sounds good.	Wannan yayi dadi.
I did not even answer you.	Ban ma amsa muku ba.
They laugh together.	Suna dariya tare.
The second car is missing.	Mota ta biyu ta bata.
Then she realized.	Sai ta gane.
So we have to be doing something right.	Don haka dole ne mu kasance muna yin wani abu daidai.
And for them.	Kuma ga su.
That led to it.	Hakan ya kai har ya samu.
They get it right away.	Suna samun nan take.
Sadness is a near thing.	Bakin ciki abu ne na kusa.
It must be too late.	Dole ne ya makara.
She said several years ago it was taken.	Ta ce shekaru da dama da suka gabata aka dauka.
What happens when it rains?	Me zai faru da an yi ruwan sama?
You did not call me.	Ba ka kira ni ba.
I would say she spent almost a month at home.	Zan ce ta yi kusan wata guda a gida.
You can leave it.	Kuna iya barin shi.
I do not speak for fear of the future.	Ba na magana saboda tsoron gaba.
It's delicious	Yana da daɗi
No can do.	Babu iya yi.
She is beautiful.	Ta yi kyau.
And he sold.	Kuma ya sayar.
I need to do.	Ina bukata a yi.
Sure she’s fine, but she has nothing to do.	Tabbas tana da kyau, amma babu abin da za ta yi.
I can be that person.	Zan iya zama wannan mutumin.
I do that.	Ina yin haka.
Do not, or you are finished.	Kar ku yi, ko kun gama.
Like, really big.	Kamar, babban gaske.
I have never seen such a great man, before.	Ban taba ganin mai girma irin wannan ba, a baya.
She seems to be fighting.	Da alama ta yi fada.
Some even have no name.	Wasu ma ba su da suna.
We can be happy again.	Za mu iya sake yin farin ciki.
Say, of course he will.	Ka ce, tabbas zai yi.
I do not know how they live there.	Ban san yadda suke yin rayuwa a can ba.
He recognized them all.	Ya gane su duka.
She used someone for that kind of thing.	Ta yi amfani da wani don irin wannan abu.
It looks good.	Yana da kyau a gani.
She used to enjoy life that way.	Ta kasance tana samun jin daɗin rayuwa haka.
Or let’s move on.	Ko kuma mu ci gaba.
It is not of the world.	Ba na duniya ba ne.
I myself have never been to one.	Ni kaina ban taba zuwa ba.
There is nothing that we can do about it.	Ba abin da za mu iya yi game da shi.
It is good to hear from you.	Yana da kyau a ji daga gare ku.
The reason for this is as follows.	Dalilin haka shi ne kamar haka.
I send them to him.	Ina aika masa su.
We have to get out.	Dole ne mu fita.
After that, everything you say will be done to you.	Bayan haka, duk abin da ka faɗa za a yi maka.
Many people were killed.	An kashe mutane da dama.
I did well.	Na yi kyau.
I think a lot of people do.	Ina tsammanin mutane da yawa suna yi.
It hurts a lot.	Ya kara rauni.
But it makes me sad.	Amma yana sa ni bakin ciki.
The surprise of me.	Mamaki ya kama ni.
It will be difficult for me, if you come back here.	Zai yi mini wuya, idan ka dawo nan.
It was an amazing sight.	Ya kasance abin gani na ban mamaki.
Last time.	Lokaci na ƙarshe.
They may have been eating more than usual.	Wataƙila sun kasance suna cin abinci fiye da yadda aka saba.
I will not go back with you.	Ba zan koma tare da ku ba.
Kids get in, they.	Yara suna shiga, suna.
Be open and aware.	Ku kasance a bude kuma ku sani.
He joined the fight.	Ya shiga fada.
That's what happened.	Shi ke nan abin ya faru.
We did not play.	Ba mu yi wasa ba.
This is actually what frightens me the most.	Wannan shi ne ainihin abin da ya fi ba ni tsoro.
And yet, no one will be found.	Kuma duk da haka, babu wanda za a samu.
I can understand it.	Zan iya gane shi.
Looking for someone.	Neman wani.
We will never get there on time if we do!	Ba za mu taɓa zuwa can akan lokaci ba idan muka yi haka!
They did not call him either.	Su ma ba su kira shi ba.
Maybe more time.	Wataƙila ƙarin lokaci.
It may not be easy, but it is possible.	Wataƙila ba abu mai sauƙi ba ne, amma ana iya yin hakan.
The place is closed.	An rufe wurin.
They want to hear it again.	Suna sha'awar sake jin shi.
I don't like it very much.	Ba na son ta da yawa.
And this is the right time.	Kuma wannan shine lokacin da ya dace.
He just laughed.	Dariya kawai yayi.
I still have two things to do.	Har yanzu ina da abubuwa guda biyu da zan yi.
None of these things anymore.	Babu wani daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan kuma.
Not there.	Babu can.
Something went wrong, and she needed to find out what it was.	Wani abu ya kasance ba daidai ba, kuma tana buƙatar gano menene.
It has happened in the past, though.	Ya faru a baya, ko da yake.
Either way it was.	A wata hanya ta kasance.
So be patient.	Sai ku yi hakuri.
It was very difficult for me.	Yana da matukar wahala a gare ni.
The killer has been arrested.	An kama wanda ya kashe shi.
Try this.	Gwada hakan.
There are few people eating.	Akwai 'yan mutane suna ci.
I need more.	Ina bukata mafi girma.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
I was so scared.	Na ji tsoro sosai.
She sat next to me.	Ta zauna kusa da ni.
The time is coming, he thought.	Lokaci na zuwa, ya yi tunani.
I have to be the one to stay.	Dole ne in zama wanda zan zauna.
Somehow nothing.	Ko ta yaya ba komai.
No one will hear.	Ba wanda zai ji.
She suffered terribly.	Ta sha wahala sosai.
I had to prepare myself.	Dole na shirya kaina.
Me and him.	Ni da shi.
There is no life for now.	Babu wani rai game da yanzu.
It adds a little sweetness.	Yana kara dan dadi.
I am fine	ina lafiya
Had it been settled.	Da an zauna.
This is true.	Wannan gaskiya ne.
Likewise tomorrow.	Haka kuma gobe.
We are already wearing our clothes.	Mun riga mun sa rigar mu.
I wondered what was in it.	Na yi mamakin me yake ciki.
I think it's a good way.	Ina ganin hanya ce mai kyau.
He was also very nice.	Ya kuma kasance mai daɗi.
I do not use them.	Ba na amfani da su.
And he was.	Kuma da ya kasance.
He is a caretaker, after all.	Shi mai kula ne, bayan haka.
Don't miss this opportunity !.	Kar ku rasa wannan damar!.
This method is very convenient.	Wannan hanya ta dace sosai.
He read well.	Yayi karatu mai kyau.
He looked inside.	Ya kalli ciki.
Nothing to gain.	Babu wani abu da za a samu.
Like a child.	Kamar yaro.
But that is gone now.	Amma wannan ya tafi yanzu.
He made another mistake.	Ya sake yin kuskure.
Sure they will, though.	Tabbas za su yi, ko da yake.
These will eventually happen.	Waɗannan za su faru a ƙarshe.
So you just talk.	Don haka kun dan yi magana.
I will be right behind you.	Zan kasance daidai bayan ku.
Nothing but money.	Ba komai sai kudi.
He will come to you.	Zai zo wurin ku.
Like now.	Kamar yanzu.
It cannot be purchased.	Ba za a iya siyan shi ba.
Good people.	Mutane masu kyau.
It is written in a wonderful and wonderful way.	An rubuta shi da ban mamaki da ban mamaki.
That would seem to me to be scary.	Wannan zai zama alama a gare ni abin tsoro ne .
You see how it fits.	Kun ga yadda ya dace.
Getting more has been a problem.	Samun ƙarin ya kasance matsala.
It's time to dump her.	Lokaci yayi da zata tafi.
He thought hard.	Ya yi tunani sosai.
He was always alive at the time.	Ya kasance koyaushe yana rayuwa a lokacin.
Of this, no doubt.	Daga cikin wannan, babu shakka.
I know how it is.	Na san yadda hakan yake.
The game was like nobody else, he assured me.	Wasan ya kasance kamar ba kowa, ya tabbatar mani.
He just told me what was necessary.	Sai kawai ya gaya mani abin da ya zama dole.
We need room to grow.	Muna buƙatar dakin girma.
I am one	Ni daya
And it is still there.	Kuma har yanzu yana nan.
But not by joy.	Amma ba ta hanyar farin ciki ba.
One has to find someone to talk to.	Dole ne mutum ya sami wanda zai yi magana da shi.
This in itself is nothing new.	Shi kansa wannan ba sabon abu bane.
I hear you.	Ina jin ku.
It is a mistake.	Kuskure ne.
He left immediately.	Ya fita nan da nan.
They did it, together.	Sun yi shi, tare.
But she is a little happy.	Amma ta ɗan yi farin ciki da shi.
What you need.	Abin da kuke bukata.
How many people live here?	Mutane nawa ne ke zaune a nan?
Aure na.	Aure na.
It started right at me.	Ya fara daidai a kaina.
I have to go outside.	Dole na fita waje.
You need to travel by bus.	Kuna buƙatar tafiya ta bas.
They were made.	Aka yi su.
There has to be a way he can do something.	Dole ne a sami hanyar da zai iya yin wani abu.
But we know it's over.	Amma mun san an gama.
No, it's all there.	A'a, duk yana nan.
I decided that you must kill him.	Na yanke shawarar cewa dole ne ku kashe shi.
She is right.	Ita ce gaskiya.
They play like us.	Suna wasa kamar mu.
We see it as follows.	Muna ganin haka kamar haka.
Maybe all will be well at this point.	Watakila duk zai yi kyau a wannan lokacin.
What happened.	Me ya faru.
It's too big	Yayi girma da yawa
In a moment it opened.	Cikin d'an lokaci ya bud'e.
Although she knew she could not.	Ko da yake ta san ba za ta iya ba.
He can work with these people.	Zai iya aiki tare da waɗannan mutane.
I saw some of it.	Na ga wasu daga ciki.
That was it.	Wanda hakan ya kasance.
Trying to keep going.	Ƙoƙarin ci gaba.
I’m just sick of waiting around and not doing anything.	Ina kawai rashin lafiya na jira a kusa da ba yin komai.
Hard thing.	Abu mai wuya.
You can change these.	Kuna iya canza waɗannan.
Maybe she wanted to find out.	Watakila ta so ya gano.
It just does its job.	Aikin sa kawai yake yi.
She is already dead.	Ta riga ta mutu.
Like her dog.	Kamar ta kare.
You just tried to protect yourself from hearing it.	Kun yi ƙoƙari kawai don kare kanku daga jin shi.
And then.	Kuma a lokacin,.
You will not be touched.	Ba za a taba ku ba.
I think she will enjoy that.	Ina tsammanin za ta ji daɗin hakan.
I'm not sure if these are the only things.	Ban tabbata ko waɗannan su ne kawai abubuwan ba.
Please help me find it.	Don Allah a taimake ni in gano shi.
It will stop.	Zai tsaya.
Only children.	Yara ne kawai.
It is never known.	Ba a taɓa sani ba.
I don't care.	Bani komai.
Little progress has been made.	An samu ci gaba kadan.
To take together.	Don ɗauka tare.
Call any time of day or night.	Kira kowane lokaci na rana ko dare.
I don’t know what to do, or how to fix this.	Ban san abin da zan yi ba, ko yadda zan gyara wannan.
He was totally there at the time, focusing on just now.	Ya kasance gaba ɗaya a lokacin, ya mai da hankali ga yanzu kawai.
I don’t know what we missed.	Ban san abin da muka rasa ba.
Every sensible person will feel that way.	Duk mai hankali zai ji haka.
But no one was there.	Amma babu kowa a wurin.
Everything.	Duk abin.
Not much has happened.	Ba wani abu da yawa ya faru.
Where he was, what he should have done.	Inda ya kasance, abin da ya kamata ya yi.
There is not much we can do.	Babu wani abu da yawa da za mu yi.
She quickly understood why.	Da sauri ta fahimci dalilin.
She did.	Ta yi.
She has it there.	Tana da shi a can.
Nothing and no one saw.	Babu wani abu kuma babu wanda ya gani.
He usually eats before going to bed.	Ya kan ci abinci kafin ya yi barci.
I can't figure out why.	Ba zan iya gano dalilin da ya sa ba.
Please be careful when swimming.	Da fatan za a yi hankali lokacin yin iyo.
I just want to talk.	Ina so in yi magana kawai.
You are talking to me.	Kuna magana da ni.
I, however, would get nothing.	Ni, duk da haka, ba zan samu komai ba.
I think you will.	Ina tsammanin za ku yi.
The task is to find them.	Aikin shine gano su.
To be close to people.	Don zama kusa da mutane.
We should work to end this.	Ya kamata mu yi aiki don kawo karshen wannan.
They go to work, they go home.	Suna zuwa aiki, su koma gida.
She needs to know everything.	Tana bukatar sanin komai.
He has the right to decide what it will be.	Yana da damar yanke shawarar abin da zai kasance.
I feel that way.	Ina jin haka.
Would you like to buy it here?	Kuna so ku saya a nan?
There are three of us now.	Mu uku ne yanzu.
All in one place.	Duk a wuri guda.
But overall, the film works.	Amma gaba ɗaya, fim ɗin yana aiki.
You are scared.	Kun ji tsoro.
In the summer, people prefer to stay home.	A lokacin zafi, mutane sun fi son zama a gida.
There is still much work to be done.	Har yanzu akwai sauran aiki da yawa a gaba.
If the moon comes out, do not.	Idan wata ya fito, kada ku yi.
The program was filmed again.	Shirin ya sake yin fim.
It is raining so hard that the ground is flooded.	Ana ruwan sama sosai har kasa ta cika da ruwa.
I did a lot.	Na yi da yawa.
But, one day, he will.	Amma, wata rana, zai yi.
He went.	Ya tafi.
People can go there and write something about it.	Mutane na iya zuwa wurin su rubuta wani abu game da shi.
You are always trying to do the right thing.	Kullum kuna ƙoƙarin yin abin da ya dace.
So, try it.	Don haka, gwada shi.
There is no place for it.	Babu wurin sa.
She really wanted to.	Ta so sosai.
That made my day.	Hakan yasa rana ta.
Do some.	Yi wasu.
It does not hurt, it does not scare.	Ba ya jin zafi, ba tsoro.
For this, they do not.	Don wannan, ba su da.
I will work.	Zan yi aiki.
You are the only one.	Kai ne kawai.
This is exactly what happened.	Wannan shi ne ainihin abin da ya faru.
I would not get up for dinner then.	Ba zan tashi cin abincin dare ba a lokacin.
He himself drank the water.	Shi kansa ya sha ruwan.
It could be me too easily.	Zai iya zama ni ma cikin sauƙi.
It must.	Dole ne.
They see little in what they do.	Suna ganin kadan a cikin abin da suke yi.
They do not eat.	Ba sa cin abinci.
And not nearly found.	Kuma ba a kusa samu ba.
You must buy it here, right now.	Dole ne ku saya a nan, a yanzu.
I'd better try it first.	Gara in gwada shi da farko.
No one wants to.	Ba wanda yake so.
We are not accustomed to thinking that.	Ba mu saba tunanin haka ba.
I was happy, playing here.	Na kasance farin ciki na, yin wasa a nan.
We do not and do not forget about you.	Ba mu da kuma ba ma manta game da ku.
Do not leave the house.	Kar ka bar gidan.
Many people come every year.	Mutane da yawa suna zuwa kowace shekara.
What did they give you to eat?	Me suka ba ka ka ci?
She did not come.	Ba ta zo ba.
I'll show you how they feel.	Zan nuna muku abin da suke ji.
That did not work at that time, however.	Wannan bai yi aiki ba a wannan lokacin, duk da haka.
People are lying.	Mutane suna yin karya.
Maybe it will let you use them.	Watakila za ta bar ka ka yi amfani da su.
I will be second to him.	Zan zama na biyu a gare shi.
He will not let me go.	Ba zai bar ni in tafi ba.
But she did not laugh.	Amma bata yi dariya ba.
Not me, no.	Ba ni ba, a'a.
The same goes for two children.	Haka yara biyu.
I'm not serious.	Ba ni da gaske.
More than a surprise.	Fiye da abin mamaki.
Make sure you take care of yourself.	Tabbatar kula da kanku.
We could not reach the place immediately.	Ba za mu iya isa wurin da sauri ba.
But it is still not finished.	Amma har yanzu ba a gama ba.
Great day.	Babban ranar.
It happens a lot.	Ya faru sau da yawa.
Think about your work.	Yi tunani game da aikin ku.
They told us to speak slowly.	Suka ce mu yi magana a hankali.
I think this becomes something if you let it go.	Ina ganin wannan ya zama wani abu idan kun bar shi.
From within himself.	Daga ciki kansa.
She had to learn and study to become the real world.	Dole ne ta koyi kuma ta yi karatu ta zama ainihin duniya.
The flight went on time.	Jirgin ya tafi akan lokaci.
But he did not do such a thing.	Amma bai yi irin wannan abu ba.
Back he feels there.	Baya yana jin akwai.
So far it is going well, but man what a day.	Ya zuwa yanzu yana tafiya da kyau, amma mutum menene rana.
You sit there, surprised.	Za ka zauna a wurin, mamaki.
Fill with fresh water.	Cika da ruwa mai dadi.
More is needed.	Ana buƙatar ƙarin.
She said she never did.	Ta ce ba ta taba yi ba.
Everyone assumes they know you.	Kowa ya dauka sun san ka.
I looked back.	Na duba a baya.
This is about us too.	Wannan game da mu ma.
There have never been two others.	Ba a taba samun wasu biyu ba.
Although, somehow we continued to find each other.	Ko da yake, ko ta yaya muka ci gaba da samun juna.
You too stand like him.	Kai ma ka tsaya kamar shi.
But the materials are very good.	Amma kayan sun yi kyau sosai.
The good thing is, we can still have kids.	Abu mai kyau shine, har yanzu muna iya samun yara.
The right game.	Wasan dama.
I would be so happy to make a mistake about that !.	Zan yi matukar farin ciki da yin kuskure game da hakan!.
Here it is, in the house.	A nan ne, a gidan.
Not a good time.	Ba lokaci mai kyau ba.
This is what she has long heard.	Wannan shi ne abin da ta dade ta ji.
He passed the room.	Ya wuce dakin.
And he almost got it.	Kuma ya kusa samu.
And it was so.	Sai ya zama kamar haka ne.
Do your job.	Yi aikin ku.
They have never been seen.	Ba a taba ganin su ba.
Three people were re-arrested.	An sake kama mutane uku.
Very nice.	Da kyau sosai.
It's too late now.	Ya makara yanzu.
Some are familiar with it.	Wasu sun saba da shi.
How was that?	Yaya hakan ya kasance?.
It can not be.	Ba zai iya zama ba.
But do not expect me to do it.	Amma kar ka yi tsammanin zan yi.
She goes out and this is done.	Tana fita aka gama wannan.
It's so good.	Ya yi kyau haka.
But she lost.	Amma ta rasa.
Maybe you know others.	Wataƙila ka san wasu.
Maybe because of him.	Wataƙila saboda shi.
She will get up for the job.	Za ta tashi don aikin.
It was a success.	An yi nasara.
You will not fail me.	Ba za ku kasa ni ba.
He appears to know exactly what to do.	Ya bayyana ya san ainihin abin da zai yi.
But it is nothing.	Amma ba wani abu ba ne.
Eating less helps you.	Rashin cin abinci shine ya taimake ku.
We know each other.	Mun san juna.
The night is long.	Dare ya dade.
They already know that.	Sun riga sun san haka.
It was very interesting.	Ya kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
And if you sell, someone else buys.	Kuma idan ka sayar, wani ya saya.
We are having fun together.	Muna jin daɗi tare.
Everything is fine.	Komai yayi kyau.
Maybe he's not with us either.	Watakila shi ma ba ya tare da mu.
And they will accept it, he thinks.	Kuma za su yarda da shi, yana tunani.
I say it.	Ina fada da shi.
I will tell you about this sometime.	Zan gaya muku game da wannan wani lokaci.
Just enough life.	Kawai isa rayuwa.
This is a surprise.	Wannan abin mamaki ne.
It has always been done.	An yi shi koyaushe.
Drive slowly, please.	Tuƙi a hankali, don Allah.
It really does.	Yana yi da gaske.
And of course.	Kuma tabbas.
This is too much!	Wannan yayi yawa!
I don’t feel he ever did.	Ba na jin ya taba yi.
He wonders how this will happen in the world.	Ya yi mamakin yadda abin zai faru a duniya.
I think it should work.	Ina ganin yakamata yayi aiki.
Let's not say anything about it again.	Kada mu sake cewa komai game da shi.
Either way, it’s fun to watch them.	Ko ta yaya, yana da daɗi don kallon su.
No hearing.	Babu ji.
It is very hot.	Tana da zafi sosai.
You do not have to worry about what they might think.	Ba dole ba ne ka damu da abin da za su iya tunani.
Only one brand is better.	Kawai wata alama sun fi kyau.
Amazing things happened there too.	Abubuwa masu ban mamaki sun faru a can ma.
I feel a little sick, honestly.	Ina jin rashin lafiya kadan, gaskiya.
I want to see what other people are saying about it.	Ina son ganin abin da wasu mutane ke cewa game da shi.
It requires work.	Yana buƙatar aiki.
He did not sleep.	Bai yi barci ba.
What he knows, he knows.	Abin da ya sani, ya sani.
This is a great place to stay.	Wannan wuri ne mai kyau don zama.
And alone.	Kuma shi kadai.
However, they are still much larger.	Duk da haka, har yanzu sun fi girma.
He kept looking at us.	Ya ci gaba da kallon mu.
He was very passionate.	Ya kasance mai sha'awar sosai.
It is a distrust of the mind.	Rashin yarda da hankali ne.
Or what it should do for you.	Ko abin da ya kamata ya yi muku.
I must know.	Dole ne in sani.
You may feel a little cold.	Kuna iya jin sanyi kaɗan.
I will continue.	Zan ci gaba.
First, this booklet does not write anything.	Na farko, wannan ɗan littafin bai rubuta komai ba.
No one raised their hands.	Babu wanda ya daga hannu.
The name is not mine.	Sunan ba nawa bane.
I just saved.	Na ajiye kawai.
Let them fly.	Bari su tashi.
That was amazing.	Hakan ya yi ban mamaki.
Time flies when they are together.	Lokaci ya tashi lokacin da suke tare.
He knows it.	Ya san shi.
I have to do it in a week.	Dole ne in yi ta cikin mako.
Please do not touch this!	Don Allah kar a taɓa wannan!
No one was told this, it was not disclosed.	Ba wanda aka gaya wa wannan, ba a bayyana shi ba.
Maybe that day.	Wataƙila wannan ranar.
She is not well.	Ba ta da kyau.
This does not suit them.	Wannan bai dace da su ba.
It shows up.	Ya nuna sama.
They will be here.	Za su kasance a nan.
It came once, not a big deal.	Ya zo sau ɗaya, ba babban abu ba.
I have to go to work tomorrow.	Dole ne in tafi aiki gobe.
Ask him out well if he is no longer absorbed in the connection.	Tambayi shi kuma ya mutu.
She got up slowly and looked at me.	Ta tashi a hankali a hankali ta duba ni.
He became even more frustrated.	Ya kara bata rai.
She touched him.	Ta taba shi.
Use them when you have time for them.	Yi amfani da su lokacin da kuke da lokaci don su.
I can read this event.	Zan iya karanta wannan taron.
He did not know what to think.	Bai san me zai yi tunani a kai ba.
I think readers want more than that.	Ina tsammanin masu karatu suna son fiye da haka.
Everyone knows now.	Kowa ya sani yanzu.
Be productive.	Ka zama mai yawan aiki.
And they touched you.	Kuma sun taba ku.
But this is something new.	Amma wannan wani sabon abu ne.
It is not something that is done.	Ba abin da aka yi ba ne.
It seems.	Alama ce.
And that he did.	Kuma cewa ya yi.
It is a matter of what works for you.	Magana ce ta abin da ke aiki a gare ku.
You must tell me what is happening.	Dole ne ku gaya mani abin da ke faruwa.
It happened.	Haka ya faru.
That's a player.	Dan wasa kenan.
They are safe.	Suna lafiya.
We are working to fix the problem.	Muna aiki don gyara matsalar.
Now, log on.	Yanzu, shiga.
Who did it? 	Wanene ya yi shi?
I do not know exactly how it happened or why it happened.	Ban san ainihin yadda abin ya faru ba ko kuma dalilin da ya sa ya faru.
I think he can.	Ina jin zai iya.
I'm interested in amazing things.	Ina sha'awar abubuwan ban mamaki.
That is a fact.	Wannan ita ce gaskiya.
Do not be afraid.	Kada ku ji tsoro.
She could not believe it was true.	Ta kasa yarda cewa gaskiya ne.
She is someone else, and you, you are not everyone.	Ita wani ce, kuma kai, kai ba kowa bane.
That didn't do anything.	Wannan bai yi komai ba.
Reader do not forget that.	Mai karatu kada ka manta da haka.
They agreed.	Sun yarda da hakan.
You think this is the best thing that has ever happened to you.	Kuna tsammanin wannan shine mafi kyawun abin da ya taɓa faruwa da ku.
I like this too.	Ina son wannan kuma.
I did not find any problem with it.	Ban sami wata matsala da shi ba.
It is difficult to know whether they really have someone.	Yana da wuya a san ko da gaske suna da wani.
I thought about it though, maybe more than once.	Na yi tunanin shi ko da yake, watakila fiye da sau ɗaya.
And you will make us a lot of money.	Kuma za ku yi mana kuɗi da yawa.
Now he knows he was right.	Yanzu ya san ya yi daidai.
See where you go next time.	Kalli inda kuke tafiya lokaci na gaba.
We have no doubt.	Ba mu da shakka.
Check out the project.	Duba aikin.
But she could not see.	Amma ta kasa gani.
There is no such school.	Babu irin wannan makaranta.
This upset her.	Hakan ya bata mata rai.
There is truth in that.	Akwai gaskiya a cikin wannan.
I'm sure this is the story he is talking about.	Na tabbata irin labarin da yake magana kenan.
It's a pleasure.	Abin farin ciki ne.
Good job everyone to keep doing great work.	Kyakkyawan aiki kowa da kowa don ci gaba da yin babban aiki.
Do not forget to wear sunscreen.	Kar a manta da sanya rigar rana.
In fact, it does not fit.	A gaskiya ma, bai dace ba.
It is the way we are named.	Ita ce hanyar da muke suna.
And he almost did.	Kuma ya kusan yi.
It was a bit of a nightmare for her.	Ya kasance mata dan jin dadi.
Obviously, they can’t take the two of us.	Babu shakka, ba za su iya ɗaukar mu biyu ba.
Tom looked for a new job.	Tom ya nemi sabon aiki.
He laughed at her.	Yayi mata dariya.
There is no way to know for sure.	Babu wata hanyar sanin tabbas.
Stand on the road.	Tsaya akan hanya.
There has never been a problem.	Ba a taɓa samun matsala ba.
And many more will come.	Kuma mutane da yawa za su zo.
But do not laugh.	Amma kar ka yi dariya.
I have no reason to defend it.	Ba ni da dalilin kare shi.
I will not cry.	Ba zan yi kuka ba.
I have no doubt that he knows how to use it.	Ba ni da shakka cewa ya san yadda ake amfani da shi.
I’m talking about the real deal.	Ina magana ne game da ainihin gaske.
The door closed on me.	Kofar ta rufe ni.
People get this.	Mutane suna samun wannan.
Sometimes you just go back.	Wani lokaci sai ka koma baya.
I can cover it.	Zan iya rufe shi.
People did not like this program.	Mutane ba su ji daɗin wannan shirin ba.
The project was a success.	Aikin ya yi nasara.
But looking after that is where the call becomes the most interesting.	Amma kallon bayan wannan shine inda kira ya zama mafi ban sha'awa.
The faster it passes in the cold, the better.	Da sauri ya wuce cikin sanyi, mafi kyau.
He wants to be used very much.	Yana son a yi amfani da shi sosai.
You all know who you are.	Duk kun san ko wanene ku.
It seems he has no problem with that.	Da alama ba shi da matsala da wannan.
The children cried together.	Yara kuka tare.
First, we must speak.	Da farko, dole ne mu yi magana.
You see, it would be nice.	Za ku ga, zai yi kyau.
Every incoming flight is on time.	Duk jirgin da ya zo yana kan lokaci.
Hurry up!	Yi sauri!
This is where we are.	Wannan shine inda muke.
There was no way they were just getting out of here.	Babu yadda suka yi kawai suna fita daga nan.
It helped me to learn so much about myself.	Ya taimaka mini in koyi abubuwa da yawa game da kaina.
Why there, he said, and there he was.	Me ya sa a can, ya ce, kuma a can ya kasance.
We do not see them.	Ba mu ganin su.
I am not well.	Ba ni da lafiya.
However, it is not so simple.	Duk da haka, ba haka ba ne mai sauƙi.
Someone needs to stay home with them most of the time.	Wani yana buƙatar zama gida tare da su mafi yawan lokaci.
She changed.	Ta canza.
I called open.	Na kira a bude.
He fell in love.	Ya fad'a cikin yarda.
You are too big.	Kun yi girma da yawa.
After a month.	Bayan wata daya.
The other players joined.	Sauran 'yan wasan suka shiga.
I do it.	Ina yin shi.
I don't even want to do it.	Ba na ma so in yi.
However, this should not be the case.	Duk da haka, wannan bai kamata ya zama haka ba.
Check before you eat, such a thing.	Ku duba kafin ku ci, irin wannan abu.
It hurts.	Ta yi zafi.
Do you know who this person is?	Kun san wanene wannan mutumin?
At this you must appear very surprised.	A wannan dole ne ku bayyana kuna mamaki sosai.
I know him personally.	Ni kaina na san shi.
Not surprisingly.	Ba abin mamaki ba ne.
I have to check.	Dole ne in duba.
I came here to get it all.	Na zo nan don in samu duka.
However get up and leave me open.	Duk da haka sai ka tashi ka bar ni a bude.
No, do not cover them.	A'a, kar a rufe su.
Everyone knows everything.	Kowa ya san komai.
However.	Duk da haka.
First, she said.	Na farko, ta ce.
But we do not want to suffer.	Amma ba ma son wahala.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
There must be a better way.	Dole ne a sami hanya mafi kyau.
I had no idea what was going on nearby, she said.	Ban san abin da ke faruwa a kusa da nan ba, in ji ta.
So they must.	Don haka dole ne su.
Children kill children.	Yara suna kashe yara.
And everyone will go against it.	Kuma kowa zai yi gaba da shi.
He will not let us go home.	Ba zai bar mu mu tafi gida ba.
He knew he was more than that.	Ya san ya fi haka yawa.
And nothing came of it.	Kuma babu abin da ya zo.
There are some simple things we can do.	Akwai wasu abubuwa masu sauƙi da za mu iya yi.
Enough is enough.	Ya isa ya isa.
Today they joined.	Yau sun shiga.
People will hate it.	Mutane za su ƙi.
There is more than us.	Akwai fiye da mu.
They did not tell her the truth.	Ba su gaya mata gaskiya ba.
That sounds good to me.	Wannan yayi min kyau.
He knows what happened.	Ya san abin da ya faru.
It seems to be gone now.	Da alama ya tafi yanzu.
It should be here too.	Ya kamata ya kasance a nan ma.
You will be glad you did.	Za ku yi farin ciki da kuka yi.
This can be done several times.	Ana iya yin hakan sau da yawa.
I do this twice a day.	Ina yin haka sau biyu a rana.
She looks amazing, though.	Ta yi kama da ban mamaki, ko da yake.
And to see everything go, like this.	Kuma don ganin komai yana tafiya, kamar haka.
He died, just like him.	Ya mutu, kamar shi.
He read about these.	Ya karanta game da waɗannan.
They must have started it.	Lallai sun fara shi.
I'll be honest.	Zan yi gaskiya.
This was really for her.	Wannan ya kasance mata da gaske.
That should not have happened in the first place.	Da tun farko bai kamata ya faru ba.
That is not the case today.	Ba haka muke da shi a yau ba.
So it should be.	Don haka ya kamata.
He loves to laugh.	Yana sha'awar ba da dariya.
And this is nothing new.	Kuma wannan ba sabon abu bane.
I'm just there.	Ina can kawai.
But they failed to get close to the ground.	Amma sun kasa isa kusa da kasa.
No one came to talk to me.	Ba wanda ya zo ya yi magana da ni.
I was surprised to hear that there was no waiting time.	Na yi mamakin jin cewa babu lokacin jira.
I want to come back and help.	Ina so in dawo in taimaka.
He hopes it doesn't show.	Ya yi fatan hakan bai nuna ba.
Hope this helped others.	Da fatan wannan ya taimaka wa wasu.
They just used whatever they could get.	Kawai sun kasance suna amfani da duk abin da suka samu.
They are better than before.	Sun fi da.
It seems wrong.	Ga alama ba daidai ba.
The more money you have, the healthier you are.	Yawan kuɗin da kuke da shi, kuna da lafiya.
Do not leave them without them.	Kar ku bar su ba tare da su ba.
He was taken out of the house.	Aka fito da shi daga gidan.
Let's do that.	Bari mu yi haka.
But that is what is happening.	Amma irin abin da ke faruwa ke nan.
For a while no one spoke.	Cikin d'an lokaci babu wanda ya yi magana.
You want to win.	Kuna so ku ci nasara.
You give someone attention, and you don’t ask for anything.	Kuna ba wa wani hankali, kuma ba ku neman komai.
This movie has it all.	Wannan fim yana da komai.
Even when it hurts more than ever.	Ko da lokacin da ya ji wuya fiye da kowane lokaci.
Another home, though.	Wani gida, ko da yake.
Do as you wish.	Yi yadda kuke so.
They wrote this book because of their success.	Sun yi wannan littafin ne saboda abin da suka ci nasara.
Nice to see you.	Na yi farin cikin ganin ku.

If you sell me.	Idan kun sayar da ni .
But immediately that made me think.	Amma nan take wannan ya sa na yi tunani.
He hit well.	Ya buga lafiya.
I need you to know this.	Ina bukata ku san wannan.
No time will be lost.	Ba za a rasa wani lokaci ba.
The equipment was left overnight.	An bar kayan aikin a cikin dare.
You think you will be happy with that.	Kuna tsammanin za ku yi farin ciki da hakan.
That's what you found out.	Abin da kuka gano ke nan.
Immediately she knew what this was.	Nan take ta san menene wannan.
But it doesn't seem to be working.	Amma ga alama baya aiki.
You could say that he does not approve of you.	Kuna iya cewa bai yarda da ku ba.
I know you work.	Na san cewa kuna aiki.
But who knows.	Amma sai wa ya sani.
He can't see now.	Ya kasa gani yanzu.
He wants them to be alone.	Yana son su kasance kawai.
But let me see.	Amma bari na gani .
Now.	Yanzu .
He wasted all the time.	Ya bata duk lokacin.
To be successful, it has never been so easy.	Don samun nasara, bai taɓa yin sauƙi haka ba.
Money, by itself, cannot buy happiness.	Kudi, da kansa, ba zai iya siyan farin ciki ba.
But he was.	Amma ya kasance.
Lots, but not exactly.	Da yawa, amma ba daidai ba.
We will ask them.	Za mu tambaye su.
He is a very wonderful man.	Mutum ne mai ban mamaki da gaske.
Not even close.	Ba ma kusa ba.

She thought maybe she should get help.	Ta yi tunanin watakila ta sami taimako.
No. They are with us.	A'a su da mu.
She knows people need her there.	Ta san mutane suna bukatar ta a can.
That's what we are.	Abin da mu ke kenan.
We laughed and laughed.	Muka yi dariya muka yi dariya.
We are all children at once.	Mu duka yara ne sau ɗaya.
The funny thing is this.	Abin ban dariya shine wannan.
We became really close.	Mun zama na gaske kusa.
Probably more now than ever.	Wataƙila fiye da yanzu fiye da kowane lokaci.
I was amazed at how many there were.	Na yi mamakin yadda suke da yawa.
He wanted to come.	Ya so ya zo.
Nothing we said above should be understood otherwise.	Babu wani abu da muka fada a sama ya kamata a fahimci in ba haka ba.
Do what you need to do.	Yi abin da kuke buƙatar yi.
There is no way to it.	Babu wata hanya zuwa gare shi.

Do not believe everything you hear.	Kada ku yarda da duk abin da kuka ji.
It did not surprise me.	Bai bani mamaki ba.
I do not know what killed him.	Ban san me ya kashe shi ba.
This, she has never done before.	Wannan, ba ta taɓa yin irin wannan ba.
Sorry, that is the case.	Yi hakuri, haka abin yake.

If not now, in the next.	Idan ba yanzu ba, a cikin na gaba.
And we are safe.	Kuma muna lafiya.
And to learn about yourself you have to be yourself.	Kuma don koyi game da kanku dole ne ku kasance da kanku.
This is where you need to be careful.	A nan ne kuke buƙatar yin hankali.
I do not really know.	Ban sani ba da gaske.

I try to make the best of it.	Ina ƙoƙarin yin mafi kyawun sa.
No, just be careful what you do.	A'a, kawai ku yi hankali a cikin abin da kuke yi.
Let it cool completely.	Bari yayi sanyi gaba daya.
No one has ever felt better after eating a plane meal.	Ba wanda ya taɓa jin daɗi bayan cin abinci na jirgin sama.
There is little problem.	Akwai matsala kadan.
But these did not happen.	Amma waɗannan ba su faru ba.
But not for a month.	Amma ba sai wata daya ba.
I have never been really healthy.	Ba a taɓa samun lafiya ba da gaske.

Easy to use and works well.	Sauƙi don amfani kuma yana aiki da kyau.
They seem to want to.	Da alama suna so.
They looked at each other in amazement.	Suka kalli juna cikin sha'awa.
Remember, she can do that.	Ka tuna cewa tana iya yin hakan.
They were not happy.	Ba su yi farin ciki ba.
It could not be otherwise.	Ba zai iya zama in ba haka ba.
Now he has lost everything she owes.	Yanzu ya rasa duk abin da ta bashi.
She called and told me.	Ta kira ta gaya min.
I do not know if that is a good thing or not.	Ban sani ba ko hakan abu ne mai kyau ko a'a.
It certainly won't last long.	Lallai ba zata dade ba.
But you did not.	Amma ba ku yi ba.
We are better off when we are together.	Mun fi kyau idan muna tare.
They stared at each other for a long time.	Sun dade suna kallon juna.
Let me explain to you something that will help you.	Bari in bayyana muku wani abu da zai taimake ku.
But the problem is you don’t.	Amma matsalar ita ce ba ka yi.
And he himself, of course.	Kuma shi kansa, ba shakka.
It doesn't fit her.	Bai dace da ita ba.
He talks a little about it.	Yana magana kadan game da shi.
This program is very good.	Wannan shirin yana da kyau sosai.
There is no such thing at home.	Babu irin wannan a gida.
This is a place.	Wannan wurin ne.
Check this out.	Duba wannan.
Now let's meet the rest.	Yanzu zo mu hadu da sauran.
And for him, what he has is everything.	Kuma a gare shi, abin da yake da shi shi ne komai.
I really, people think so.	Ina da gaske, mutane suna tunanin haka.
There is a play with water.	Akwai wasa da ruwa.
I am in the right place.	Ina wurin da ya dace.
It's outside.	Yana waje.
Bring it down.	Kawo shi kasa.
She started removing the material.	Ta fara cire kayan.
He sees people in these things.	Yana ganin mutane a cikin waɗannan abubuwa.
As he has seen in every movie.	Kamar yadda ya ga kowane fim.
Stop at everything.	Tsaya a komai.
Everything, he knows, is fine.	Komai, ya sani, daidai ne.
Let's go out for lunch.	Mu fita cin abincin rana.
I want to stay.	Ina so in zauna.
I hope he says no.	Ina fatan ya ce a'a.
Everyone went home.	Kowa ya koma gida.
For me, well, I did it just because I wanted to.	A gare ni, da kyau, na yi shi ne kawai saboda ina so.
She does this from time to time.	Tana yin hakan lokaci zuwa lokaci.
It is not too late.	Ba a makara ba.
He knew what would be best.	Ya san abin da zai fi dadi.
This works for me, check it out once.	Wannan yana aiki a gare ni, duba shi sau ɗaya.
I stopped for something.	Na tsaya don wani abu.
Go ahead, we all love you.	Ci gaba, duk muna son ku.
I have a lot of things to ask him out of other things.	Ina da abubuwa da yawa da zan tambaye shi daga wasu abubuwa.
It appears she did a little bit.	Ya bayyana ta yi kadan kadan.
See if you see anything.	Duba idan kun ga wani abu.
He let us make amends.	Ya bar mu mu yi gyara.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
He is a child.	Yaro ne.
I know things about you too.	Na san abubuwa game da ku kuma.
This is not fair.	Wannan bai dace ba.
It has never been safe.	Bai taba zama lafiya ba.
Do not give them outside.	Kar a ba su waje.
He is coming here.	Yana zuwa nan.
I think this is a mistake.	Ina ganin wannan kuskure ne.
If there is anything they can get for nothing, they will take it.	Idan akwai abin da za su iya samu ba don komai ba, za su dauka.
He is greater than you, more than all of us.	Ya fi ku girma, ya fi mu duka.
On that day, one was not.	A wannan ranar, daya bai kasance ba.
It takes some time.	Yana ɗaukar ɗan lokaci.
It just needs to be played.	Yana bukatar wasa kawai.
She made a mistake.	Ta yi kuskure.
We work very closely together.	Muna aiki tare sosai.
It will change things.	Zai canza abubuwa.
If he does not pay me.	Idan bai biya ni ba.
I do not know why.	Ban san dalilin ba.
Maybe people like this.	Wataƙila mutane suna jin daɗin wannan.
She was weak.	Ta kasance mai rauni.
All of these were new to us.	Duk waɗannan sun kasance sabon abu a gare mu.
I don't think anyone can love me.	Bana jin wani zai iya so na.
You can't get it all.	Ba za ku iya samun duka ba.
Some people just aren’t cut out.	Wasu mutane kawai ba a yanke su ba.
We did not.	Ba mu yi ba.
But the book is more than that.	Amma littafin ya fi haka.
It feels wrong.	Yana jin ba daidai ba.
Go home now.	Ku tafi gida yanzu.
That's why we help him with it.	Shi ke nan mu taimaka masa da shi.
But then someone else did.	Amma sai wani ya yi.
Don't be upset.	Kada ku ji daɗi.
That’s why we have a job.	Shi ya sa muke da aiki.
They don't talk to me.	Ba sa magana da ni.
Only three of us.	A cikin mu uku ne kawai.
Put your favorite in coffee.	Sanya abin da kuka fi so a cikin kofi.
Maybe he is drinking it well.	Watakila yana shan shi da kyau.
Continuing education will be necessary.	Ci gaba da karatu zai zama dole.
We would have signed something, just to go.	Da mun sanya hannu a kan wani abu, don kawai mu tafi.
I want to go back to school.	Ina so in koma makaranta.
Everyone loves money.	Kowa yana son kudi.
So, it comes from somewhere.	Don haka, yana zuwa daga wani wuri.
I checked there several times.	Na sake duba can sau da yawa.
Maybe you will enjoy this too.	Wataƙila za ku ji daɗin wannan ma.
Turn it off, though.	Kashe shi, ko.
It will never happen again.	Ba zai ƙara faruwa ba.
Many have changed in a short period of time.	Da yawa sun canza a cikin ɗan lokaci kaɗan.

He would prefer it with a drink.	Zai fi son shi da abin sha.
I do not want to be arrested, but it is a mistake.	Ba na son a kama ni, amma kuskure ne.
So it was.	Haka ta kasance.
Not her thing.	Ba abin ta ba.
This is funny.	Wannan abin ban dariya ne.
He eats it.	Yana ci da shi.
It looks great.	Yayi kama sosai.
There is only one thing that is certain.	Akwai abu ɗaya kawai wanda ya tabbata.

Here's what to do.	Ga abin da za mu yi.
You did very well.	Ka yi kyau sosai.
But then and now.	Amma a lokacin ne kuma yanzu.
You're doing the same thing.	Kuna yin irin abin ɗauka .
So we planned to cut in the morning.	Don haka muka shirya yanke safe.
I can't believe it either.	Ni ma na kasa yarda da hakan.
So please, do what you can.	Don haka don Allah, yi abin da za ku iya.
I want a child and a marriage, one day.	Ina son yaro da aure, wata rana.
That's life.	Haka rayuwa take.
No work required.	Babu aikin da ake bukata.
That would upset him.	Hakan zai bata masa rai.
No one said anything for a while.	Ba wanda ya ce komai na ɗan lokaci.

They make no mistake.	Ba sa kuskure.
I can't go there yet.	Ba zan iya zuwa wurin ba tukuna.

He went.	Ya tafi.
You buy good food.	Kuna siyan abinci mai kyau.
Great place to fight.	Babban wurin fada.
I can work with everything with beauty.	Zan iya yin aiki tare da komai tare da kyau.
It will be good for everyone tomorrow.	Zai yi wa kowa kyau gobe.
And you start out.	Kuma kun fara fita.
If you have this, you have a lot.	Idan kana da wannan, kana da yawa.
Maybe more than once.	Wataƙila fiye da sau ɗaya.
They could not speak.	Ba su iya magana.
I would love to hear from you about it !.	Zan so in ji daga gare ku game da shi!.
He is obviously in some kind of heat.	Babu shakka yana cikin wani irin zafi.
I came three times before he let me go to work.	Na zo sau uku kafin ya bar ni in tafi aiki.
It could be mine easily.	Zai iya zama nawa cikin sauƙi.
We will stand together.	Za mu tsaya tare.
Get out of the house.	Fita daga gida.
Who wrote this?	Wanene ya rubuta wannan?
It was like in the movie.	Ya kasance kamar a cikin fim.
Seeing this brought back that kind of thinking.	Ganin haka ya dawo da irin wannan tunanin.
She stopped and walked out.	Ta tsaya ta fita.
But it requires more effort to do everything.	Amma yana buƙatar ƙarin ƙoƙari don yin komai.
That hasn't happened yet.	Har yanzu hakan bai faru ba.
But then it happened to me.	Amma sai abin ya faru da ni.
She felt very comfortable.	Ta ji dadi sosai.
No, it does not rain.	A'a, ba ruwan sama.
He has a lot of other things to worry about.	Yana da wasu abubuwa da yawa da zai damu.
I have never used it myself.	Ban taɓa amfani da shi da kaina ba.
It is better to forget everything.	Zai fi kyau a manta da komai.
But that's enough for now.	Amma ya isa haka a yanzu.
But that's all behind.	Amma duk a baya kenan.
He played amazing.	Ya buga ban mamaki.
I saw what he could do last night.	Na ga abin da zai iya yi a daren jiya.
Everyone wants to be healthy, happy, and productive in life.	Kowa yana son ya kasance lafiya, farin ciki, da amfani a rayuwa.
And you can not do anything.	Kuma ba za ku iya yin komai ba.
And you can't.	Kuma ba za ku iya ba.
The water is hot.	Ruwan ruwa ya yi zafi.
We need to know.	Muna bukatar mu sani.
So, why is no one doing anything?	Don haka, me ya sa babu wanda ke yin wani abu?
They will be together until the end.	Za su kasance tare har zuwa ƙarshe.
But there is no reason to add one.	Amma babu dalilin ƙara wani.
If it were interesting, it would be amazing.	Idan ta kasance mai ban sha'awa, zai zama abin mamaki.
It would be nice to start feeling the same though.	Zai yi kyau a fara jin ɗaya ko da yake.
And he loved me.	Kuma ya so ni.
There were two policemen on the scene.	Akwai 'yan sanda biyu a wurin.
They will talk hopefully what happened.	Za su yi magana da fatan abin ya faru.

That's what you found out.	Abin da kuka gano ke nan.
Worked with them.	An yi aiki tare da su.
They are already late for the meeting.	Sun riga sun makara taron.
There is no place in the world where life can not live somehow.	Babu wani wuri a duniya da rayuwa ba za ta iya rayuwa ko ta yaya ba.
They were amazing.	Sun kasance masu ban mamaki.
Life goes on.	Rayuwa ta ci gaba.
It can change the mind.	Yana iya canza tunani.
But it always hurts as much as it does.	Amma ko da yaushe yana jin zafi kamar yadda yake da kyau.
But it is not.	Amma ba haka ba ne.
Some died along the way, too.	Wasu sun mutu a hanya, da yawa.
And there people were killed.	Kuma a can aka kashe mutane.
It just happens.	Yana faruwa ne kawai.
You know what you are being tested for.	Kun san abin da ake gwada ku.
No one knows us.	Babu wanda ya san mu.
What an amazing discovery!	Abin da ban mamaki gano!
I'm glad you like it though.	Na yi farin ciki da kuna son shi ko da yake.
All of these things worked in a positive way.	Duk waɗannan abubuwa sun yi aiki a hanya mai kyau.
They are talking to you.	Suna yi muku magana.
Maybe three times.	Wataƙila sau uku.
And so the idea came to him.	Kuma kamar haka ne tunanin ya zo masa.
One day, it may be you.	Wata rana, yana iya zama ku.
And they succeeded.	Kuma sun yi nasara.
I think it will be the night before the wedding.	Ina tsammanin zai yi da dare kafin bikin aure.
We are better than them.	Mun fi su.
But he did not want to.	Amma bai so ba.
See what he did.	Kalli abin da ya yi.
Get up early and get a good night's sleep.	Ka tashi da wuri ka yi barci mai kyau.
There will never be success.	Ba za a taba samun nasara ba.
Too much to talk about.	Ya yi yawa don magana.
So be it.	Haka ya kasance.
Think of it this way.	Ka yi tunani game da shi kamar haka.
I hate food.	Na ƙi abinci.
He stood in the doorway waiting.	Ya tsaya bakin kofar gida yana jira.
I will tell you one day.	Zan gaya muku wata rana.
They will not be there to help us.	Ba za su kasance a wurin don taimaka mana ba.
I do nothing.	Ba na yin komai.
Do you want to get married?	Kuna son yin aure.
There are many unknowns.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ba a san su ba.
And probably even more so.	Kuma tabbas ma fiye da haka.
I think that's very good.	Ina ganin hakan yayi kyau sosai.
I don't remember when it was night.	Ban tuna lokacin da dare yayi ba.
Note that there are fears, but still progress.	Kula da cewa akwai tsoro, amma har yanzu ci gaba.
We must answer no.	Dole ne mu amsa a'a.
You have done the right thing, come forward.	Kun yi abin da ya dace, ku zo gaba.
Drink water first.	A sha ruwa tukuna.
They got everyone.	Sun samu kowa.
He almost killed her.	Ya kusa kashe ta.
She will change that quickly.	Za ta canza wannan da sauri.
I have never seen this car.	Ban taba ganin motar nan ba.
And the bus came here.	Kuma bas ya zo nan.
Before he left me.	Kafin ya bar ni.
Or you linger.	Ko kun dade.
Nice home.	Gida mai kyau.
Of course we will.	Tabbas za mu yi.
Stainless steel.	Bakin karfe.
A little if the truth is known.	Dan kadan in an san gaskiya.
For her or herself.	Don ita ko kansa.

The car sped off slowly.	Motar ta kara sauri a hankali.
He did not return to work.	Bai koma bakin aiki ba.
He’s the only real one here.	Shi kadai ne na gaske a nan.
Sorry about that.	Yi hakuri da komai.
The one I think left behind early.	Wanda nake tsammanin ya bar baya da wuri.
He is asleep, he must be.	Yana barci, dole ya kasance.
It's up to him.	Sai da shi.
It's right here.	Yana da shi daidai a nan.
They never talked about it.	Ba su taba magana a kan hakan ba.
There is no, still, anything of the sort.	Babu kuma, har yanzu, wani abu na irin.
How that makes you feel.	Yaya hakan ya sa ku ji.
It must also.	Dole ne kuma.
Some are not difficult.	Wasu ba su da wuya.
But something killed them.	Amma wani abu ya kashe su.
I am familiar, but enough.	Na saba, amma isa.
Another way.	Wata hanyar.
False, not so.	Karya, ba haka bane.
I think we have to wait and see.	Ina tsammanin dole ne mu jira mu gani akan hakan.
This book is nothing new.	Wannan littafin ba sabon abu bane.
More than a few years ago.	Sama da shekara guda kadan da suka wuce.
Let's move on.	Mu ci gaba.
The opportunity is too big to miss.	Damar tana da girma da yawa don a rasa.
But there is something else at work here too.	Amma akwai wani abu kuma a wurin aiki a nan kuma.
I do not understand that.	Ban fahimci hakan ba.
Now if you like it, great.	Yanzu idan kuna son shi, mai girma.
And as she said.	Kuma kamar yadda ta ce.
Maybe she has a better life now.	Wataƙila ta sami mafi kyawun rayuwa a yanzu.
He was passionate about reading.	Ya kasance mai sha'awar karatu.
I think he made me a better world.	Ina tsammanin ya yi min duniya mai kyau.

These are shown in.	Ana nuna waɗannan a cikin.
Now wait a second here.	Yanzu jira na biyu a nan.
Save that article, he said.	A ajiye wannan labarin, in ji shi.
In the end, though, nothing was enough.	A ƙarshe, ko da yake, babu abin da ya isa.
There is no way he will encounter someone he knows.	Ba yadda zai yi ya ci karo da wanda ya sani.
Stand in it.	Tsaya a ciki.
Then he thought of something.	Sai ya yi tunanin wani abu.
He is a man.	Wani mutum ne.
Sometimes they play with me, though.	Wani lokaci suna wasa da ni, ko da yake.
I looked but did not see anyone.	Na duba amma ban ga kowa ba.
I have a wife, two children.	Ina da mata, yara biyu.
I think that's really funny.	Ina tsammanin hakan abin ban dariya ne da gaske.
I saved the rest.	Na ajiye sauran abubuwan.
If he does, let him go.	Idan ya yi, bari ya tafi.
Have you finished your homework?	Kun gama aikin gida?
We can end this call.	Za mu iya kawo karshen wannan kira.
That would be nice, you know.	Wannan zai yi kyau, ka sani.
I think he is old.	Ina tsammanin yana da shekaru.
It works really well.	Yana aiki sosai.
Look here, here, here.	Duba nan, da nan, da nan.

It’s amazing when you ask me.	Yana da ban mamaki idan kun tambaye ni.
She is here where she can do it.	Tana nan inda za ta iya yin hakan.
Of the material, she was right.	Daga cikin kayan, ta yi gaskiya.
I can't go out.	Ba zan iya fita ba.
I was not in charge of them.	Ban kasance mai kula da su ba.
It was the last time they would ever see each other.	Shi ne karo na ƙarshe da za su taɓa ganin juna.
But no one came to me.	Amma ba wanda ya zo gare ni.
But we know exactly what is going on.	Amma mun san ainihin abin da ke faruwa.
He ate three meals a day.	Ya ci abinci sau uku a rana.
You do not even know if what you see is true.	Ba ka ma san ko abin da ka gani na gaskiya ne.
I said we would get another one right away.	Na ce za mu samu wani nan take.
It will change it.	Zai canza shi.
I gave myself without thinking.	Na ba da kaina ba tare da tunani ba.
If he can.	Idan zai iya.
But she knew one thing.	Amma ta san abu ɗaya.
Now everyone has a job to do.	Yanzu kowa yana da aikin da zai yi.
It's so delicious.	Yana da dadi sosai.
He did not want to, she took.	Bai so, ta dauka.
All he had to do was die.	Duk abin da zai yi shi ne ya mutu.
Tomorrow will be another day.	Gobe ​​zai kasance wata rana.
I even agree.	Har na yarda.
I have been thinking for a long time about how to deal with this.	Na dade ina tunanin yadda zan yi aiki da wannan.
We never thought of getting married then.	Ba mu taba tunanin aure ba a lokacin.
But the time will come.	Amma lokaci zai zo.
That said.	Abin da ya ce.
No one is coming after us.	Babu mai zuwa bayan mu.
I want to hear about this.	Ina son jin labarin wannan.
Dive into the water slowly.	Shiga cikin ruwa a hankali.
We wrote to each other several times.	Mun rubuta wa juna sau da yawa.
But she certainly didn't look like a laughing stock.	Amma tabbas ba ta yi kama da mai dariya ba.
I'm not there.	Ba na can.
I think being with you is good, too.	Ina tsammanin zama tare da ku yana da kyau, kuma.
And that worked out well for me.	Kuma hakan yayi min kyau.

This, however, did not.	Wannan, duk da haka, bai yi ba.
And in a way, it does.	Kuma a wata hanya, yana yi.
Focus on one, and when you do, move on to the next.	Mai da hankali kan ɗaya, kuma idan kun samu, je zuwa na gaba.
She calmed me down afterwards.	Ta yi min sanyi bayan haka.
It’s in an amazing place though.	Yana cikin wani wuri mai ban mamaki ko da yake.
I did this.	Na yi wannan.
And not you.	Kuma ba ku.
And the goods keep coming.	Kuma kayan yana ci gaba da zuwa.
There is little time.	Akwai ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
When you get a new job, God help.	Lokacin da kuka sami sabon aiki, Allah ya taimaka.
It doesn't matter if you die.	Babu komai idan kun mutu.
All these feelings are there.	Duk waɗannan ji suna nan.

Almost everyone took the story.	Kusan kowa ne ya dauki labarin.
But because they are not, they can be changed.	Amma saboda ba su, ana iya canza su.
I can't work.	Ba zan iya aiki ba.
I raised my answer, but they left.	Da na daga nawa amsa, amma sun tafi.
So you have a chance.	Don haka kuna da wata dama.
It's hard to wait.	Yana da wuya a jira.
So it can happen with food.	Don haka zai iya faruwa da abinci.
You can't have a bigger name than this.	Ba za ku iya samun suna mafi girma fiye da wannan ba.
It took him too much to pay attention.	Sai da ya yi yawa ya kula.
It is metal.	Karfe ne.
You must do this.	Dole ne ku yi wannan.
They could not recognize him.	Sun kasa gane shi.
She gave me money.	Ta ba ni kudi.
But we want to grow things.	Amma muna son girma abubuwa.
Stainless steel construction.	Bakin karfe yi.
So the problem becomes interesting.	Don haka matsalar ta zama mai ban sha'awa.
I think he broke it for sure.	Ina tsammanin ya karya ta tabbas.
The car is a role model.	Motar abin koyi ne.
She too.	Ita kuma.
Look, maybe it's like that.	Duba, watakila kamar haka ne.
But say nothing.	Amma kar a ce komai.
It seems that the end of the world is near.	Da alama karshen duniya kenan.
Don’t go unpleasant early, now.	Kada ku tafi bata jin daɗi da wuri, yanzu.
She wanted to go out.	Ta so ta fita.
The future is not so.	Gaba ba haka ba ne.
Whatever your reason, it is wrong.	Ko menene dalilin ku, ba daidai ba ne.

This is something new.	Wannan wani sabon abu ne.
I do not want to add anything to you.	Ba na so in kara muku komai.
It is near the door.	Yana kusa da kofar.
How much is too much?	Nawa kadan ne.
How did we do it?	Yaya muka yi?
From your end, of course.	Daga karshen ku, babu shakka.
We are not healthy here anymore.	Ba mu da lafiya a nan kuma.
Just coming.	Kawai zuwa.
There is no need to think about that even now.	Babu bukatar tunani game da hakan a yanzu ma.
However, some liquids are very problematic.	Amma, wasu kayan ruwa suna da matsala sosai.
I asked her to re-read what she had written.	Na tambaye ta ta sake karanta abin da ta rubuta.
But nothing can be done about it.	Amma babu abin da za a yi masa.
Someone knows someone, she said.	Wani ya san wani, in ji ta.
Here is her answer.	Ga amsa ta a nan.
I should not marry her.	Bai kamata in aure ta ba.
Learn to enjoy them.	Koyi don jin daɗi da su.
I will continue to use.	Zan ci gaba da amfani.
They told him to stop, but he continued on his way.	Suka ce masa ya tsaya, amma ya ci gaba da tafiya.
I think they are very good.	Ina tsammanin suna da kyau sosai.
They make money once in a while.	Suna samun kuɗi sau ɗaya a lokaci guda.
Of course it was tested well.	Tabbas an gwada da kyau.
This is the place of weakness.	Wannan shi ne wurin rauni.

One way is by yourself.	Hanya ɗaya ita ce ta kanku kawai.
We must remove it from here.	Dole ne mu cire shi daga nan.
Just tell me what you want.	Kawai gaya mani abin da kuke so.
She drank coffee slowly.	Ta sha kofi a hankali.
Of course, if you feel ill, do not get on board.	Tabbas, idan kun ji rashin lafiya, kada ku shiga cikin jirgin.
She would not let me touch her.	Ba za ta bar ni in taba ta ba.
The doctor said the operation was successful.	Likitan ya ce aikin ya yi nasara.
It's hard to try.	Yana da wuya a gwada.
We all know that.	Mu duka mun san haka.
We have no place to be except here.	Ba mu da inda za mu kasance sai a nan.
They will understand.	Za su gane.
You can see this place.	Kuna iya ganin wannan wurin.
There is no one to take care of her.	Babu mai kula ta.
But then he laughed.	Amma sai yayi dariya.
These are interesting to me.	Waɗannan suna da ban sha'awa a gare ni.
We are all safe.	Mu duka muna lafiya.
I came close to being one myself.	Na zo kusa da zama ɗaya da kaina.
After all, it looks like he killed everything.	Bayan haka, kamar ya kashe komai.
We need to know what happened.	Muna bukatar mu san abin da ya faru.
I want to go.	Ina so in yi tafiya.
A lot can happen at that time.	Da yawa zai iya faruwa a lokacin.
Find something that works for you and don’t worry about it.	Samu abin da ke aiki a gare ku kuma kada ku damu da shi.

I think we need them all.	Ina ganin muna bukatar su duka.
She drank hot coffee.	Kofi mai zafi ta sha.
We have nothing to eat.	Ba mu da abin da za mu ci.
Work has to be work and home has to be home.	Dole ne aikin ya zama aiki kuma gida ya zama gida.
Do not drink or drive.	Kada ku sha kuma ku tuƙi.
What will you do in the future?	Me za ku yi a nan gaba?
I'm leaving now.	Zan tafi yanzu.
He let the dog run at night.	Ya bar kare ya gudu da dare.
But that did not happen.	Amma hakan bai faru ba.
I really do not know how to take it.	Lallai ban san yadda zan dauka ba.
And he does.	Kuma haka yake yi.
This is an unusual problem.	Wannan matsala ce da ba a saba gani ba.
It is good when it works.	Yana da kyau idan yana aiki.
The water looks amazing.	Ruwan yana kama da ban mamaki.
They are just looking for time.	Suna neman lokaci ne kawai.
But that's what you live for.	Amma abin da kuke rayuwa don shi ke nan.
And nothing.	Kuma babu abin da.
You have one.	Kuna da daya.

I decided to try this.	Na yanke shawarar gwada wannan.
You do not know anything about it.	Ba ku san komai game da shi ba.

She plans to do another one at a time.	Ta yi shirin yin wani a wani lokaci.
I see what he does for you.	Na ga abin da yake yi muku.
Everyone loves to laugh.	Kowa yana son dariya.
No, it is not.	A'a, ba wani bane.
Only a small amount of money is saved here and there.	Kawai ana ajiye 'yan kuɗi kaɗan nan da can.

Do not really forget.	Kar a manta da gaske.
Come back tomorrow.	Dawo mu kwana.
The house is cold.	Gidan yayi sanyi.
She has none.	Ba ta da ko ɗaya.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lokaci yayi da zan tafi yanzu.
Maybe it kills her.	Wataƙila yana kashe ta.
I was very happy.	Na yi farin ciki sosai.
If he looks at it, he can see very well.	Idan ya kalli haka, zai iya gani sosai.
He wanted to be left alone.	Ya so a bar shi shi kadai.
That's fine, folks.	Ya yi kyau haka, mutane.
We all know what was done.	Mu duka mun san abin da aka yi.
They are very capable women.	Mata ne masu iya aiki sosai.
I will get a new job.	Zan sami sabon aiki.
We have been together ever since.	Tun daga nan muke tare.
It was delicious and amazing.	Ya kasance mai daɗi da ban mamaki.
We know that we cannot fail now.	Mun san cewa ba za mu iya kasa a yanzu ba.
He looked familiar.	Ya duba saba.
Let us not take this path.	Kada mu dauki wannan hanyar.
And we do not know where we are.	Kuma ba za mu san inda muke ba.
It was funny.	Ya zama abin ban dariya.
I hope it is a great success.	Ina fatan babban nasara ce.
No one was killed.	Ba a kashe kowa ba.
I am not anyone.	Ban zama wani ba.
We are ready.	Mun shirya.

Love who you are.	So wanda kai.
I like people that way.	Ina son mutane haka.
I do not know where to start.	Ban san ta ina zan fara ba.
I told him exactly what had happened.	Na gaya masa ainihin abin da ya faru.
And it is wrong.	Kuma ba daidai ba ne.
I have been waiting for a long time.	Na dade ina jira.
You know how it feels right now.	Kun san yadda wannan yake ji a yanzu.
Or the next one.	Ko kuma na gaba.
I sat and waited for something to change.	Na zauna ina jiran wani abu ya canza.
I agree with that.	Na yarda da hakan.
This made him feel uncomfortable.	Hakan ya sa shi jin ba dadi.
First of all, this is an amazing thing.	Da farko, wannan wani abu ne mai ban mamaki.
When you feel good, you are at your best.	Lokacin da kuke jin daɗi, kuna cikin mafi kyawun ku.
No one has ever seen or heard anything.	Ba wanda ya taɓa gani ko jin komai.
However, this only happens once a month at best.	Duk da haka, wannan yana faruwa sau ɗaya a wata mafi kyau.
I did not do it again.	Ban sake yi ba.
Girls love them.	'Yan mata suna son su.
Now she is wearing a dress.	Yanzu tana sanye da riga.
I'm going to do really well, now.	Zan yi kyau sosai, yanzu.
That was fine.	Hakan ya kasance lafiya.
She did not know what to think or hear.	Ba ta san me za ta yi tunani ko ji ba.
There were girls there.	Akwai 'yan mata a wurin.
But he asked me.	Amma ya tambaye ni.
Not a great opportunity.	Ba babban dama ba.
You are also selfish.	Kai ma mai son kai ne.
She is beautiful.	Tana da kyau.
We all have.	Mu duka muna da.
It's scary.	Abu ne mai ban tsoro.
In fact she knows nothing.	A gaskiya bata san komai ba.
She certainly did not say.	Lallai ba ta ce ba.
That someone was right.	Cewa wani yayi gaskiya.
He lives it.	Yana rayuwa shi.
Everything about everything.	Komai akan komai.
I try not to cry.	Ina ƙoƙarin kada in yi kuka.
Can you tell me the truth.	Kuna iya gaya mani gaskiya.
I can not say whether it is true.	Ba zan iya cewa ko gaskiya ne.
He read in this period many times.	Ya karanta a cikin wannan lokacin da yawa.
I will be on it.	Zan kasance a kai.
I was very happy.	Na yi farin cikin jin daɗi.
They played a great game.	Sun yi wani babban wasa.
Without any problems.	Ba tare da wata matsala ba.
Like it was done.	Kamar an yi haka.
Looking for a job.	Neman aiki.
If not, it must be released.	Idan ba haka ba, dole ne a sake shi.
But that is the best thing we can do right now.	Amma wannan shine mafi kyawun abin da za mu iya yi a yanzu.
And when.	Kuma yaushe.
There is nothing she wants in the world.	Babu wani abu da take so a duniya.
I left behind a lot.	Na bar baya da yawa.
For others.	Don wasu.
We need more such reading.	Muna buƙatar ƙarin karatu irin wannan.
I was very surprised.	Na yi mamaki sosai.
We hope you all enjoyed the event.	Muna fatan duk kun ji daɗin taron.
That's why he left them alone together.	Shi ya sa ya bar su su kadai tare.
She will not do it.	Ba za ta yi ba.
That would be difficult for her.	Wannan zai yi mata wuya.
He was a role model for me.	Ya kasance abin koyi a gare ni.
He ate, without desire.	Ya ci abinci, ba tare da sha'awa ba.
How exactly does she do that?	Yaya daidai take yin hakan?
But she is very sad.	Amma ta yi bakin ciki sosai.
Start from today.	Fara daga yau.
Life happens very fast.	Rayuwa tana faruwa da sauri sosai.
It's too fast.	Bata yi sauri ba.
They can be any kind of story you like.	Suna iya zama kowane irin labarin da kuke so.
So, cut it out.	Don haka, yanke shi.
I have confirmed this above.	Na tabbatar da hakan a sama.
I hope to be whatever he wants.	Ina fatan zama duk abin da yake so.
There are many other interesting things in this book.	Akwai wasu abubuwan ban sha'awa da yawa a cikin wannan littafin.
There is no one like us.	Babu wani kamar mu.
And don't either.	Kuma kada ku ma.
Maybe even before now.	Wataƙila tun kafin yanzu.
They decided not to fight.	Sun yanke shawarar kada su yi fada.
Ask someone who helped you with a project.	Tambayi wanda ya taimake ku akan wani aiki.
And there is still work to be done.	Kuma har yanzu sauran aiki a yi.
I love this time of year again.	Ina son wannan lokacin na shekara kuma.
Where were they ?.	Inda suka kasance?.
Tell me how you like them.	Faɗa mini yadda kuke son su.
We cannot and do not need to do this.	Ba za mu iya kuma ba ma bukatar yin wannan.
But you can see.	Amma kuna iya gani.
Eventually, he got a job.	A ƙarshe, ya sami aiki.
But there are them.	Amma akwai su.
It should be prepared early.	Yakamata a shirya da wuri.
They want to make you happy.	Suna so su ba ku farin ciki.
They can help you outdoors.	Za su iya taimaka muku waje.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane.
They seem to be moving very fast.	Da alama suna tafiya sosai.
Please you will all be here.	Don Allah za ku kasance duka a nan.
I did well in that.	Na yi kyau a hakan.
I'll see what happens.	Zan ga abin da ya faru.
They started walking on the moon.	Suka fara tafiya akan wata.
I can't hear anything.	Ba na jin komai.
That's the end of it.	Karshen gani kenan.
We all do not like them.	Duk mu ba mu so su.
Don't be sure though.	Kar ku tabbata ko da yake.
It will come in good time.	Zai zo cikin lokaci mai kyau.

Of course not us.	Tabbas ba mu bane.
No wonder there.	Babu mamaki a can.
They said it had to be opened.	Sai suka ce sai an bude.
Maybe she is still here.	Wataƙila har yanzu tana nan.
By the way.	A hanyar magana.
Quickly he replied.	Da sauri ya amsa.
It's a few.	Yana da 'yan kaɗan.
Maybe they thought they could live with it.	Wataƙila sun yi tunanin za su iya rayuwa da shi.
I must go.	Ina so in tafi.
Something was left out.	An bar wani abu.
I was also surprised.	Ni ma abin mamaki ne.
It would be better if we had more years together.	Zai fi kyau idan mun sami ƙarin shekaru tare.
He wants to be there.	Yana son zama a wurin.
It was as if he had just gotten up.	Ya yi kamar ya dan tashi.
We will do it on the day.	Za mu yi shi a ranar.
All one needs.	Duk daya bukata.
I don't like it there.	Ba na son shi a can.
He went out.	Ya fita.
Write down your thoughts.	Rubuta tunanin ku.
But that is not the whole story.	Amma ba wannan ba duka labarin ba ne.
I love you girls.	Ina son ku 'yan mata.
Bad things are happening.	Mummunan abubuwa suna faruwa.
It cannot be done.	Ba za a iya yi ba.
Look around you.	Kalli a kusa da ku.
They came back one by one.	Suka dawo daya bayan daya.
They did not.	Ba su yi ba.
I enjoy traveling, you see.	Ina jin daɗin tafiya, kun gani.
So we lose for a while, we just drive.	Don haka sai mu rasa na ɗan lokaci, muna tuƙi kawai.
Want to do the same thing.	Ana son yin abu ɗaya.
Be very careful when driving at night.	Yi hankali sosai idan kuna tuƙi da dare.
No need to talk.	Bata bukatar magana.
We will talk to him.	Za mu yi magana da shi.
Can someone please help me.	Shin wani don Allah zai iya taimaka mini.
It worked amazingly fast.	Ya yi aiki mai ban mamaki da sauri.
She will not surprise anyone now.	Ba za ta kama kowa da mamaki yanzu ba.
Now I want to play this new game.	Yanzu ina so in buga wannan sabon wasan.
He may not come to fight tomorrow.	Wataƙila ba zai zo faɗa ba gobe.
But this was in the past, and now.	Amma wannan shi ne a baya, kuma yanzu.
And just remember, you are doing a great job.	Kuma ku tuna kawai, kuna yin babban aiki.
It is better to go back to the car.	Yayi kyau ya koma mota.
Do not stop fighting.	Kar a daina fada.
It's just amazing.	Abin mamaki ne kawai.
We were very scared.	Mun ji tsoro sosai.
No one likes it.	Babu wanda yake son shi.
They continued.	Suka ci gaba.
He gave us this opportunity.	Ya ba mu wannan dama.
They are not children.	Ba yaro bane.
Second, you are completely wrong.	Na biyu, kun yi kuskure gaba ɗaya.
No one is in the running.	Babu kowa a cikin gudu.
Or where we do.	Ko kuma inda muke yi.
Money will not do.	Kudi ba zai yi ba.
And help them as we help everyone.	Kuma ku taimake su kamar yadda muke taimakon kowa.
But something went wrong.	Amma wani abu ya kasance ba daidai ba.
The latter is our favorite.	Na karshen shine wanda muka fi sha'awar.
What he wants is always right.	Abin da yake so koyaushe daidai ne.
We can not continue to live in the past.	Ba za mu iya ci gaba da rayuwa a baya ba.
It will not be safe here.	Ba zai kasance lafiya a nan ba.
I enjoyed reading that.	Na ji daɗin karanta hakan.
Maybe they always feel that way.	Wataƙila koyaushe suna jin haka.
And who knows, maybe they'll go.	Kuma wa ya sani, watakila za su tafi.
He is a great man.	Mutum ne mai girma.
It was not a happy occasion.	Ba lokacin farin ciki ba ne.
Some people are completely filled with surprise.	Wasu mutane gaba daya sun cika da mamaki.
But she never let that happen.	Amma ba ta taba barin hakan ta faru ba.
Where did all this water go?	Ina duk wannan ruwan ya tafi?
What really happened.	Me ya faru da gaske.
The one I see sad.	Wanda nake ganin bakin ciki.
I saw him think that.	Na ga yana tunanin hakan.

I began to recognize him.	Na fara gane shi.
If you are sad, cry.	Idan kana bakin ciki, yi kuka.
Or not.	Ko a'a.
She will forgive him for hurting him.	Zata bashi hakuri akan ta bata masa rai.
I have never felt that way.	Ban taba jin haka ba.
I leave it to you.	Na bar muku shi.
He will go.	Zai tafi.
This item must be turned off.	Dole a kashe wannan abu.
I can't help but feel it.	Ba zan iya ba sai ji da ita.
And, no problem.	Kuma, ba matsala.
There seems to be a lot of work to be done.	Da alama akwai damar aiki da yawa.
That night.	Wannan daren.
But that would be frustrating.	Amma hakan zai bata mata rai.
There is so much beauty and truth in this statement.	Akwai kyau da gaskiya da yawa a cikin wannan magana.
There are a few people in it.	Akwai 'yan mutane a ciki.
I'm waiting for you to come back.	Ina jiran ku dawo.
The same thing will happen to you.	Haka zai faru gare ku ma.
We are working.	Muna aiki.
Everyone is really, really good.	Kowa ya ci gaba da gaske, da kyau sosai.
If you enjoyed the first book, it just gets better.	Idan kun ji daɗin littafin farko, kawai yana samun kyau.
It has to be something.	Dole ne ya zama wani abu.
We need to think about it when something big happens.	Muna bukatar mu yi tunani game da hakan lokacin da wani babban abu ya faru.
He is always there.	Kullum yana can.
We must be honest.	Dole ne mu kasance masu gaskiya.
He knew he could bring it when he needed it.	Ya san zai iya kawo lokacin da ya bukata.
It does not taste very good.	Ba dadi sosai.
You have to start with yourself.	Dole ne ku fara cikin kanku.
This drink is delicious!	Wannan abin sha yana da daɗi!
This will do two things.	Wannan zai yi abubuwa biyu.
I do not know where it came from, but it was.	Ban san daga ina abin ya fito ba, amma ya kasance.
But it takes you so far and works well.	Amma yana ɗaukar ku zuwa yanzu kuma yana aiki da kyau.
It pays on time.	Ya biya akan lokaci.
But not you.	Amma ba kai ba.
But no, that was not the case.	Amma a'a, hakan bai kasance ba.
It's funny.	Yana da ban dariya.
But still he did not give up.	Amma duk da haka bai bari ba.
Ready to go?	Shirya don tafiya?
She soon realized there was a problem.	Bata dade ba ta gane akwai matsala.

I do not mind.	Ban damu ba.
And it was answered.	Kuma aka amsa.
Don't get tired.	Kar ka yarda ka gaji.
I think to myself.	Ni kaina nake tunani.
But quickly he began to doubt.	Amma da sauri ya fara shakka.
Immediately she sat down.	Nan take ta zauna.
Someone might say something.	Wani zai iya cewa wani abu.
That's what he's waiting for.	Abin da yake jira kenan.
It has always been a joy.	Koyaushe ya zama abin farin ciki.
Don't start me!	Kar a fara ni!
Tom did not answer.	Tom bai amsa ba.
There could be no better day for her.	Ba za a iya samun rana mafi kyau gare ta ba.
Maybe for a while.	Wataƙila na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
The faster, the better.	Da sauri, mafi kyau.
I still remember how everyone cried that day.	Har yanzu ina tuna yadda kowa ya yi kuka a ranar.
I know him very well.	Na san shi sosai.
Be sensitive to the feelings of others.	Kasance mai kula da yadda wasu ke ji.
Obviously, it is a problem.	Babu shakka, matsala ce.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
You see.	Kun gani.
He told me he would not pay me.	Ya ce mini ba zai biya ni ba.
If you can take some heat, sit in it.	Idan za ku iya ɗaukar wani zafi, zauna a ciki.
Our meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.	Gobe ​​aka shirya taron mu.
Maybe you didn’t.	Wataƙila ba ku yi ba.
Many children enjoy playing together.	Yara da yawa sun ji daɗin yin wasa tare.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
I was scared to come out.	Na ji tsoro na fito.
Can you get it?	Za a iya samun ta?
You already have thoughts about it.	Kun riga kuna da tunani game da shi.
It is not difficult to see why.	Ba shi da wuya a ga dalilin da ya sa.
And there are other things.	Kuma akwai wasu abubuwa.
Of course they look like it.	Tabbas suna kama da shi.
This thing surprised me.	Wannan abu ya ba ni mamaki.
But she looks like that.	Amma ta ga kamar haka.
She drank.	Ta sha sha.
We will only talk to other people.	Za mu yi magana da sauran mutane ne kawai.
Sorry you can't.	Yi hakuri ba za ku iya ba.

This is amazing.	Wannan shine abin ban mamaki.
But then maybe not.	Amma sai kuma watakila a'a.
The two were home.	Biyu sun kasance gida.
As it was, he was arrested.	Kamar yadda yake, an kama shi.
We did not even see everything we would see.	Ba mu yi ko ganin duk abin da za mu gani ba.
And how to suffer.	Kuma yaya ake shan wahala.
Still we are moving forward.	Duk da haka muna ci gaba.
As for me.	Amma ni.

Happiness will not stop there.	Abin farin ciki ba zai tsaya a nan ba.
Do you think you can help me with this?	Kuna tsammanin za ku iya taimaka mini da wannan.
But, for now, she can no longer do anything.	Amma, a yanzu, ba za ta iya ƙara yin komai ba.
This is a feature in the article.	Wannan alama ce a labarin.
But we need to go beyond that.	Amma muna bukatar mu wuce haka.
High unemployment.	Rashin aikin yi sosai.
They are ready to play tonight.	Sun shirya don buga wasan yau da dare.
I never said no.	Ban taba cewa a'a ba.
Everyone knows the truth.	Kowane mutum ya san gaskiya.
The first time people play your game, it has to be fun.	A karo na farko da mutane ke buga wasan ku, dole ne ya zama mai daɗi.
As we know.	Kamar yadda muka sani.
They grew up for me.	Sun yi girma a gare ni.
We can only sit here.	Za mu iya zama a nan kawai.
We did not sleep.	Ba mu yi barci ba.
Sit in the car.	Zauna a cikin mota.
Fortunately, please, in this way.	Abin farin ciki, don Allah, ta wannan hanya.
You feel the need for others to like you.	Kuna jin bukatar wasu su so ku.
What's up now? 	Me yake ciki yanzu?
The thought was simple.	Tunanin ya kasance mai sauƙi mai sauƙi.
No food was provided.	Ba a ba da abinci ba.
He could not believe that he was planning to do this, but.	Ya kasa yarda cewa yana shirin yin wannan, amma.
I have a plan.	Ina da shirin.
Would that be a good way?	Shin hakan zai zama hanya mai kyau?.
He changed the world.	Ya canza duniya.
And each user has one.	Kuma kowane mai amfani yana da guda ɗaya.
This is not good.	Wannan ba shi da kyau.
We worked together.	Mun yi aiki tare.
There are only three of them there.	Su uku ne kawai a wurin.
Everyone looked at the second hand.	Kowa ya kalli hannu na biyu.
It's just a matter of time.	Lokaci ne kawai.
And he did not.	Kuma bai yi haka ba.
You have to take care of it properly.	Dole ne ku kula da shi yadda ya kamata.
Not finished.	Ba a gama ba.
That's how we get.	Ta haka ne muke samun.
We still need you.	Har yanzu muna bukatar ku.
Even she killed him.	Ko da ita ce ta kashe shi.
Maybe he spoke later.	Watakila ya yi magana daga baya.
All through the house.	Duk ta gidan.
They are looking for you.	Suna neman ku.
They are afraid they will die if they stay.	Suna tsoron kada su mutu idan suka zauna.
He wondered if it was still better.	Ya yi tunanin ko duk da haka ya fi kyau.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
Good job easy to get.	Kyakkyawan aiki mai sauƙi don samun.
You are not alone.	Ba kai kadai ba.
It is best to place it for use.	Zai fi kyau a sanya shi don amfani.
I see it every day.	Ina ganin shi kowace rana.
I have prepared it for you.	Na shirya muku shi.
But she failed to let it show.	Amma ta kasa bari ya nuna.
You do not know if you want to laugh or cry.	Ba ku sani ba ko kuna son yin dariya ko kuka.
That's what they do best.	Abin da suka fi yi ke nan.
I have nothing to do.	Ba ni da abin yi.
Immediately it was said, do not send to your place.	Nan da nan aka ce, kar a aika zuwa wurin da kuke.
A little bit from everyone.	Kadan kadan daga kowa.
Everyone wants a simple life.	Kowa yana son rayuwa mai sauƙi.
He added as she said.	Ya kara yadda ta ce.
So they decided to make a lot of money.	Don haka suka yanke shawarar samun kuɗi da yawa.
But, of course, she did not.	Amma, ba shakka, ba ta yi ba.
I was very happy to get help.	Na yi matukar farin ciki da samun taimako.
Apparently, maybe.	Alama, watakila.
He plays well.	Yana wasa lafiya.
It works well.	Yana aiki mai kyau.
Coffee is good.	Kofi yana da kyau.
Do what you can.	Yi abin da za ku iya.
Remove and let cool slightly.	Cire kuma bari yayi sanyi kadan.
They couldn’t laugh at me.	Sun kasa yi mani dariya.
So don't let that bother you.	Don haka kar wannan ya sa ku.
I'm afraid he doesn't.	Ina jin tsoro ba shi da.
This is what it looks like he is dead.	Wannan shi ne abin da yake kamar ya mutu.
Know when it is.	Ku san lokacin da yake.
We called him, but there was no answer.	Mun kira shi, amma babu amsa.
I will study hard.	Zan yi karatu sosai.
But, this is not known.	Amma, wannan ba a sani ba.
Yet we have to make sure we do.	Amma duk da haka dole mu tabbatar mun yi.
It makes me feel funny.	Yana sa ni jin ban dariya.
You can make a lot of mistakes.	Kuna iya yin kuskure sosai.
I'd like to have a massage.	Ina son a so.
The second point is the same.	Magana ta biyu haka take.
I think it's good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau.
There is nothing that cannot be killed.	Babu wani abu da ba za a iya kashe shi ba.
Myself, so you know.	Ni kaina, don haka ku sani.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Maybe a little too much.	Wataƙila ya ɗan yi yawa.
Leave it there.	Bar shi a can.
I can see very well.	Ina iya gani sosai.
If it's fast enough, it's fast enough.	Idan yana da sauri isa, yana da sauri isa.
This can be accomplished as follows.	Ana iya cika wannan kamar haka.
He did not want us to do it.	Bai so mu yi ba.
And so it is.	Kuma haka yana da.
So it may be so.	Don haka yana iya zama haka.
And often the last thing the night before bed.	Kuma sau da yawa abu na ƙarshe da dare kafin barci.
So, that's fine.	Don haka, hakan yayi kyau.
I took it badly.	Na dauki mummunan.
He said nothing.	Bai ce komai ba.
I have been doing this for years.	Na yi haka tsawon shekaru.
Let's leave it at that.	Mu bar shi.
I will do this if you want me to do so.	Zan yi haka idan kuna so in yi haka.
I had to stand up for myself.	Dole ne in tsaya wa kaina.
It's amazing to me.	Yana da ban mamaki a gare ni.
But he knew them.	Amma da ya san su.
No need for that day, though.	Babu bukata a wannan ranar, ko da yake.
You see them a lot.	Kuna ganin su da yawa.
I myself have told you.	Ni da kaina na gaya muku.
But we have two things.	Amma muna da abubuwa guda biyu.
That you have to accept.	Cewa dole ka yarda.
But maybe two like this could play a good game.	Amma watakila biyu kamar wannan na iya yin wasa mai kyau.
Some things there surprised me.	Wasu abubuwa a wurin sun ba ni mamaki.
Do not let it happen man.	Kada ka bari ya faru mutum.
I care about them.	Na damu da su.
But we are too late.	Amma mun wuce lokaci.
They get it.	Suna samun shi.
Immediately as they appeared, they left.	Nan da nan kamar yadda suka bayyana, suka tafi.
This is a lot bigger than us.	Wannan ya fi mu girma da yawa.
I did nothing.	Ban yi komai ba.
You know when.	Kun san yaushe.
Be on time, anytime.	Kasance a cikin lokaci, kowane lokaci.
She has a job, and she looks like him.	Tana da aiki, kuma ta yi kama da shi.
We got out of the car and got in.	Muka fito da gudu muka shiga mota muka shiga.
You do it because it catches you.	Kuna yi ne saboda yana kama ku.
Keep checking it out.	Ci gaba da duba shi.
It's a hot summer day.	Ranar zafi mai zafi.
People do not like the truth.	Mutane ba sa son gaskiya.
They want answers.	Suna son amsa.
We do not kill anyone.	Ba mu kashe kowa.
I can’t be so smart.	Ba zan iya zama mai hankali haka ba.
This comes from the way you take yourself.	Wannan ya zo daga hanyar da kuke ɗauka da kanku.
You may have more than one feeling.	Kuna iya samun ji fiye da ɗaya.
Either way.	Ko ya kasance.
He entered the library.	Ya shiga dakin karatu.
I went to help him.	Na je in taimake shi.
That makes two.	Hakan ya sanya biyu.
We do not need to talk about that.	Ba mu buƙatar yin magana game da hakan.
Who is the man who came home?	Wane ne mutumin da ta zo gida?
They have children.	Suna da yara.
They are funny people.	Mutane ne masu ban dariya.
I will kill him.	Zan kashe shi.
I hope you like it !.	Ina fatan kuna son shi!.
Let's get started.	Mu fara.
Of course we are still on.	Tabbas har yanzu muna kan.
I know her, she lives very little.	Na san ta, tana zaune ne kaɗan kaɗan.
I think something happened.	Ina tsammanin wani abu ya faru.
Everything is fine for him.	Komai yayi masa kyau.
It was to protect the user and to protect us.	Ya kasance don kare mai amfani da kuma kare mu.
Cannot be or cannot be.	Ba za a iya ba ko ba za a iya ba.
I don’t do any of these things.	Ba na yin ko ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan.
No talking to this person.	Babu magana da wannan mutumin.
They can be anything.	Za su iya zama wani abu.
Or the car.	Ko kuma motar.
Then we.	Sai mu.
Who is he?	Wanene shi.
They did not fail at home.	Ba su yi rashin nasara ba a gida.
The answer is good.	Amsa yayi kyau.
It didn't do me any good.	Bai yi min kyau ba.
He looks back.	Yana kallon baya.
No need to say anything.	Babu bukatar cewa komai.
More often than not.	Sau da yawa kuma.
We do not need anyone to ask us.	Ba ma bukatar kowa ya tambaye mu.
Trust me.	Ku yarda da ni.
This is true.	Wannan gaskiya ne.
However, despite our best efforts, things can go awry.	Duk da haka, duk da ƙoƙarin da muke yi, abubuwa na iya yin kuskure.
Something is wrong.	Wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
See or see.	Duba ko a gani.
You may find yourself talking to yourself.	Kuna iya samun kanku kuna magana da kanku.
Some are walking.	Wasu suna tafiya.
One person can.	Mutum daya zai iya.
He looked around the room carefully.	Ya duba dakin da kyau.
Still, that doesn't matter.	Har yanzu, hakan ba komai.
But it is good at night.	Amma yana da kyau da dare.
I don't know what they are using now.	Ban san abin da suke amfani da su yanzu ba.
This is about me.	Wannan game da ni ne.
He does not feel like I am doing it.	Ba ya jin kamar ni ne nake yin hakan.
That is part of what is happening here.	Wannan yana cikin abubuwan da ke faruwa a nan.
She just sits there.	Zaune take kawai.
Not surprisingly.	Ba abin mamaki ba ne.
I did not finish.	Ban gama ba.
We knew we were going to go somewhere interesting.	Mun san cewa za mu je wuri mai ban sha'awa.
Will we stop for coffee?	Za mu tsaya shan kofi?
More is needed.	Akwai buƙatar ƙarin.
But they were also terrifying.	Amma kuma sun kasance masu ban tsoro.
The owners were amazed.	Masu gida sun yi mamaki.
I do not want to be here.	Ba na son zama a nan.
I just feel needed.	Ina jin bukata kawai.
I tried to think.	Na yi ƙoƙari na yi tunani.
I know nothing.	Ban san komai ba.
Please wait here.	Da fatan za a jira a nan.
I told him all this.	Na gaya masa duk wannan.
But that seems to be too much.	Amma da alama hakan yayi yawa.
Must go.	Dole ne a tafi.
You did not speak to me.	Baka yi min magana ba.
I love it though.	Ina son shi ko da yake.
The man will run away like a little scared.	Mutumin zai gudu kamar ɗan tsoro.
To succeed.	Don samun nasara.
I did not give you money.	Ba na ba ku kuɗi ba.
He has been ill since childhood.	Ya yi rashin lafiya tun yana yaro.
They want to get married.	Sun so su yi aure.
I want to know you better.	Ina so in san ku da kyau.
I will be sure to do so.	Zan tabbata yin haka.
I want to see you again.	Ina so in sake kallon ku.
Some people do not agree with the story.	Wasu mutane ba su yarda da labarin ba.
You just have to get the best of what you bought.	Dole ne kawai ku sami mafi kyawun abin da kuka saya.
You want everyone to be happy.	Kuna so kowa ya yi farin ciki.
You will enjoy yourself.	Za ku ji daɗin kanku.
He had to keep it together.	Dole ne ya ajiye shi tare.
When did that happen so much?	Yaushe aka samu da yawa haka?
You are the best.	Ke ce mafi kyau duka.
I did not sleep.	Ban yi barci ba.
Come back and look for more.	Dawo da neman ƙarin.
And what she said was true.	Kuma abin da ta fada gaskiya ne.
We have nowhere to go.	Ba mu da inda za mu je.
He expected her to answer.	Yayi tsammanin ta amsa.
It is not on time.	Ba ya kan lokaci.
I have a house now.	Ina da gida yanzu.
The game reveals an interesting fact.	Wasan ya bayyana gaskiya mai ban sha'awa.
I could try it anyway.	Zan iya gwada shi ta wata hanya.
I can't wait for anyone to hear.	Ba zan iya jira kowa ya ji ba.
How to get me back.	Yadda za su dawo da ni.
Where we live is where we live.	Inda muke zama shine inda muke zaune.
We do not see this conclusion as correct.	Ba mu ga wannan ƙarshe ba daidai ba ne.
He just said.	Yace kawai.
Now, she does well.	A yanzu, ta yi kyau.
You said earlier.	Kun fada a baya.
They do not walk.	Ba sa tafiya.
I remember she was here.	Na tuna tana nan.
It has never really grown.	Ba a taɓa samun girma da gaske ba.
Or maybe just leave it at that.	Ko watakila kawai bar shi.
What you did was wrong.	Abin da kuka yi ba daidai ba ne.
The time of year also did not hurt.	Lokacin shekara ma bai yi rauni ba.
She helped me a lot.	Ta taimake ni da yawa.
We have some words to say, about this.	Muna da wasu magana da za mu yi, game da wannan.
I am everything, he said.	Ni ne komai, in ji shi.
She was, for me.	Ta kasance, a gare ni.
I wish they hadn't been opened.	Da ma da ba a bude su ba.
I'm sure of	Na tabbata ga
Get a new driver.	Sami sabon tuƙi.
Now we are giving them food.	Yanzu muna ba su abinci.
Nice and carefully.	Da kyau kuma a hankali.
This is not a bad thing.	Wannan ba mummunan abu ba ne.
You see, I did not do that.	Ka ga ba ni ne na yi wannan abu ba.
It can come and go for up to two years.	Yana iya zuwa ya tafi har zuwa shekaru biyu.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Yi hakuri don ci gaba da tafiya.
This was not expected.	Ba a yi tsammanin wannan ba.
It happens to really like that.	Ya faru da gaske son cewa.
She's just beautiful.	Tana da kyau kawai.
I know how it is.	Na san yadda abin yake.
I don’t want to talk about it too much.	Ba na son yin magana game da shi da yawa.
I have some products to try.	Ina da wasu kayan da zan gwada.
They will do well with work.	Za su yi kyau tare da aiki.
Very nice now.	Yayi kyau sosai yanzu.
Just does not hear me.	Kamar baya ji na.
I didn't think of anything.	Ban yi tunanin komai ba.
It’s a lot bigger, with it.	Yana da yawa mai yawa, tare da shi.
Previously unknown.	A da ba a san su ba.
So, they just did it.	Don haka, sun yi haka kawai.
I caught him on the head.	Na kama shi a kai.
I am not patient.	Ni ba mai hakuri ba ne.
Make sure no one is hurt.	Tabbatar cewa babu wanda ya ji rauni.
We have to fix that.	Dole ne mu gyara hakan.
Not very much of an effort.	Ba sosai da yawa na ƙoƙari.
It's from the police.	Daga 'yan sanda ne.
Stem.	Kara.
Try it.	Gwada shi.
It was here that he got married.	A nan ne ya yi aure.
How can that be?	Yaya hakan zai iya kama?.
At the time there was still nothing.	A lokacin har yanzu babu komai.
We are not going to talk about it now.	Ba za mu yi magana game da shi yanzu ba.
Either way, he was.	A wata hanya, ya kasance.
However, it is more than that.	Duk da haka, ya fi haka.
They used to think about the past.	Sun kasance suna yin tunani a kan abubuwan da suka gabata.
Even more so.	Har ma fiye da haka.
The chief physician apologized.	Babban likitan ya bata hakuri.
He got up to work preparing the plane.	Ya tashi aiki yana shirya jirgin.
In fact, both can work.	A gaskiya ma, duka biyu suna iya aiki.
You can get them.	Kuna iya samun su.
We will understand something.	Za mu gane wani abu.
It was easy, this one.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi, wannan.
Talk to him about what to do.	Yi magana da shi game da abin da za a yi.
He immediately recognized him.	Nan take ya gane shi.
To end the heat.	Don kawo karshen zafi.
I think she is smart.	Ina jin tana da hankali.
Maybe you will hate me.	Wataƙila za ku ƙi ni.
Some did not.	Wasu ba su yi ba.
He found himself doing more and more.	Ya samu kansa yana kara yi.
Put a necklace on me.	Saka abin wuya a kaina.
We do a lot of things there.	Muna yin abubuwa da yawa a can.
No one will keep me there.	Babu wanda zai ajiye ni a wurin.
Without effort, he pointed out.	Ba tare da ƙoƙari ba, ya nuna.
You really should check it out.	Lallai yakamata ku duba.
Interested in it.	Sha'awar shi.
I really enjoyed this meal.	Lallai na ji daɗin wannan abincin sosai.
Yet it did not frighten her.	Amma duk da haka bai sa ta tsoro ba.
We have to do this work.	Dole ne mu yi wannan aikin.
I do not have to say twice.	Ba sai na ce sau biyu ba.
Kids like her don’t.	Yara kamar ita ba sa.
Not night or day.	Ba dare ba rana ba.
It happens here and there.	Yana faruwa nan da can.
You are out now.	Kun fito gare ku yanzu.
Although not all.	Ko da yake ba duka ba.
She left nothing.	Bata bar komai ba.
This can work really well, too.	Wannan na iya aiki sosai, kuma.
You are afraid of losing, you can not win!	Kuna jin tsoron rasa, ba za ku iya yin nasara ba!
There is no country by itself.	Babu kasa ita kadai.
I didn’t want him to get too involved with me.	Ban so ya kara shiga cikin kaina ba.
They look healthy and seem to be living well.	Suna kama da lafiya kuma da alama suna rayuwa da kyau.
I will be fine now.	Zan yi lafiya yanzu.
But it must be.	Amma tabbas dole ne.
Maybe we can't fix it.	Wataƙila ba za mu iya gyara shi ba.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a san abin da zai faru na gaba ba.
But there is still more to come.	Amma har yanzu da sauran abubuwa masu zuwa.
The water is full now.	Ruwan ya cika yanzu.
He never wanted to be.	Bai taba son zama ba.
I'm afraid that's the problem.	Ina tsoron matsalar kenan.
I will not miss this for the world.	Ba zan rasa wannan don duniya ba.
We feel comfortable.	Muna jin dadi.
He is nothing to me anymore.	Shi ba komai ba ne a gare ni kuma.
Things will never happen.	Abubuwa ba za su taɓa faruwa ba.
Or is it.	Ko kuma shi ne.
They look up.	Suna kallon sama.
That's what he gave it.	Abin da ya ba shi kenan.
I can't find anything better.	Ba zan iya samun wani abu mafi kyau ba.
And it wasn’t the first funny story he gave him.	Kuma ba shi ne labarin ban dariya na farko da ya ba shi ba.
We cannot live without this tool.	Ba za mu iya rayuwa ba tare da wannan kayan aikin ba.
End of article.	Karshen labarin.
So should you.	Haka ya kamata ku.
I think they know that.	Ina jin sun san haka.
I don’t think they made a mistake.	Ban yi tsammanin sun yi kuskure ba.
And he gave them.	Kuma ya ba su.
I can't use you like this.	Ba zan iya amfani da ku kamar wannan ba.
For most people.	Ga mafi yawan mutane.
He is here with the rest of us.	Yana nan tare da sauran mu.
No one in the house is safe.	Babu kowa a gidan nan da yake lafiya.
He looked like a man.	Ya yi kama da mutum.
When we did this thing.	Lokacin da muka yi wannan abu.
I am a human being	Ni mutum ne
Completely gone.	Gaba daya ya tafi.
I don't care how it is.	Ban damu da yadda abin yake ba.
I do not want to.	Ban so ba.
What happened in the past does not come into play here.	Abin da ya faru a baya bai zo cikin wasa ba a nan.
She helped me think.	Ta taimaka min tunani.
Don't talk like that.	Kar a yi magana haka.
There is always time to fix it later.	Koyaushe akwai lokacin da za a gyara daga baya.
God is not wise.	Allah ba shi da hankali.
Maybe they will forget it.	Wataƙila za su manta da shi.
People do not always know what they need.	Mutane ba koyaushe suke sanin abin da suke bukata ba.
I never left.	Ban taɓa barin ba.
He used to be in trouble at school.	Ya kasance yana cikin matsala a makaranta.
I do not plan to drink today.	Ban shirya sha ba yau.
Exactly, exactly, three.	Daidai, daidai, uku.
Better yet.	Gara haka.
Yet, it comes down to it.	Amma duk da haka, ya zo a kasa.
Maybe even before.	Wataƙila ma kafin.
But then, it took time before it happened.	Amma sai, ya ɗauki lokaci kafin ya faru.
I was so wrong.	Na yi kuskure sosai.
I did not expect to come here this morning.	Ban yi tsammanin zuwa nan da safe ba.
Never see anyone doing that.	Kada ka taba ganin wani yana yin haka.
It has been so fast now.	Ya kasance haka sauri yanzu.
It's a big job.	Babban aiki ne.
I killed her.	Na kashe ta.
It is time to change.	Lokaci ya yi da za a canza.
We have never heard of such a thing.	Ba mu taba jin irin wannan abu ba.
I know, smart.	Na sani, mai hankali.
It's a job.	Yana da wani aiki.
They are in mine.	Suna cikin nawa.
We do not know what to do about it.	Ba mu san abin da za mu yi game da shi ba.
Maybe we can get there a little more often.	Wataƙila za mu iya zuwa can kaɗan kaɗan sau da yawa.
That is the end.	Wannan shine karshen.
She got up quickly.	Ta tashi da sauri.
He said I would take time.	Yace zan d'auki lokaci.
I can't do that.	Ba zan iya yin hakan ba.
There is something scary about it.	Akwai wani abu mai ban tsoro game da shi.
No land.	Babu kasa.
And that's just it.	Kuma wannan shi ne kawai.
Just because they are here.	Kawai saboda suna nan.
Find out what happened and where it is.	Gano abin da ya faru da kuma inda take.
There are very few children.	Yara kaɗan ne.
This is for them.	Wannan shi ne a gare su.
Something has to be found.	Dole ne a sami wani abu.
I hit the ground running.	Na buga kasa.
I am not.	Ni ba haka ba.
I want to kill someone.	Ina so in kashe wani.
We closed that too.	Mun rufe hakan ma.
Will he succeed, not really.	Shin zai yi nasara, ba da gaske ba.
No pain.	Babu zafi.
Probably not.	Wataƙila ba haka ba ne.
I did not laugh at him.	Ban yi masa dariya ba.
It started to rain.	An fara ruwan sama.
I only came once.	Na zo sau daya kawai.
Everything is wrong.	Komai ba daidai ba ne.
This is what people have done wrong.	Wannan shi ne abin da mutane suka yi kuskure.
I think it's amazing.	Ina tsammanin abin mamaki ne.
Why not help her?	Me ya sa ba za ku taimaka mata ba?
If you are looking for someone who can think.	Idan kana neman wanda zai iya tunanin.
But this is good for kids.	Amma wannan yana da kyau ga yara.
I can't access anything.	Ba zan iya samun damar shiga wani abu ba.
They go out.	Suna fita.
He did not answer.	Bai amsa ba.
And it can still be.	Kuma yana iya har yanzu.
You can't do that.	Ba za ku iya yin hakan ba.
I am not sure about anything.	Ba ni da tabbas game da komai.
But not twice around.	Amma ba sau biyu a kusa ba.
We do it a lot.	Muna yin shi da yawa.
But it does not work for reading.	Amma ba ya aiki don karatu.
He does not want to come.	Baya son zuwa.
I will not leave.	Ba zan fita ba.
Need to get out.	Bukatar fita.
That's enough considering.	Wannan ya isa idan aka duba .
Even when you get the best.	Ko da lokacin da kuka sami mafi kyau.
Together, they work well together.	Tare, suna aiki da kyau tare.
I have not lost any food.	Ban rasa abinci ba.
They got up.	Suka tashi.
I left her alone.	Na bar ta ita kadai.
He can eat.	Zai iya ci.
It's definitely hard to come by.	Lallai yana da wahala a iya zuwa.
I did this for two years.	Na yi haka tsawon shekaru biyu.
Maybe someone called us for help.	Wataƙila wani ya kira mu don taimako.
More than that, they need time to play.	Fiye da haka, suna buƙatar lokaci don yin wasa.
He said she would go.	Yace mata zai tafi.
It does not appear very clear.	Ba ya bayyana sosai.
This shows you how amazing this is.	Wannan yana nuna maka yadda wannan abin ban mamaki ne.
This is definitely true.	Wannan tabbas gaskiya ne.
Fear of the unknown.	Tsoron wanda ba a sani ba.
I will almost certainly.	Kusan tabbas zan.
This is true today more than ever.	Wannan gaskiya ne a yau fiye da kowane lokaci.
She admired him.	Ta sha'awar shi.
And they succeeded.	Kuma sun yi nasara.
This is a good thing.	Wannan abu ne mai kyau .
You have to keep moving forward.	Dole ne ku ci gaba da tafiya gaba.
He could have, but he did not.	Zai iya samu, amma bai samu ba.
He immediately realized that.	Nan da nan ya gane cewa.
It must be stopped.	Dole ne a daina.
I saw something else.	Na ga wani abu kuma.
You do not have to do this.	Ba lallai ne ku yi wannan ba.
I will come and sit here and work.	Zan zo in zauna a nan da kaina in yi aiki.
I really enjoyed it so much.	Na ji daɗi sosai da ita haka.
We have no dog.	Ba mu da kare.
She has been married twice.	Ta yi aure sau biyu.
We will definitely use it.	Babu shakka za mu yi amfani da shi.
Be with us.	Ku kasance da mu.
He’s a nice guy, but we weren’t exactly two people.	Mutum ne mai dadi, amma ba mu kasance daidai mutane biyu ba.
Prepare on it.	Shirya akan shi.
I think that would be a problem.	Ina ganin hakan zai zama matsala.
It's nothing.	Ba komai ba ne.
But no.	Amma babu.
Water is water.	Ruwa ruwa ne.
You must love to travel.	Dole ne ku so tafiya.
He was taken by surprise.	Mamaki ne ya kama shi.
There are so many.	Akwai da yawa.
I will not try to do what they did.	Ba zan yi ƙoƙarin yin abin da suka yi ba.
Now this will be a big name for this project.	Yanzu wannan zai zama babban suna ga wannan aikin.
I can no longer speak.	Ba zan iya ƙara magana ba.
I also like the name.	Ina kuma son suna.
Of course there is more to it than that.	Tabbas akwai abin da ya wuce haka.
They have not confirmed anything.	Ba su tabbatar da komai ba.
I don't need any.	Bana bukatar wani.
He was very helpful.	Ya kasance mai ba da taimako sosai.
Do not be afraid.	Kar ku ji tsoro.
The train door was full of people.	Kofar tashar jirgin kasa ta cika da mutane.
Just wait for the right opportunity.	Jira kawai damar da ta dace.
Do you have any other money?	Shin kuna da sauran kuɗi?
It is too late.	Yanzu an makara.
Explain the way.	Bayyana hanya.
I actually know this.	A gaskiya na san wannan.
No one will believe me.	Ba wanda zai yarda da ni.
Still waiting.	Har yanzu ana jira.
It is somewhere in the house.	Wani wuri ne a cikin gidan.
Dinner was also there.	Abincin dare kuma ya kasance a wurin.
Nothing has become anything.	Ba abin da ya zama wani abu.
And we’ve proven it many times.	Kuma mun tabbatar da shi sau da yawa.
I think he does.	Ina tsammanin yana yi.
He stayed with us, so we stayed with him.	Ya tsaya tare da mu, don haka muka tsaya tare da shi.
Let's wait and see.	Sai mu jira mu gani.
You have dinner, and you are in good health.	Kun sami abincin dare, kuma kuna cikin lafiya.
It works.	Tana aiki.
And these are the best kind of people.	Kuma waɗannan su ne mafi kyawun irin mutane.
But that is how it happened.	Amma ta wannan hanya ta faru.
You cannot sit close to him without feeling it.	Ba za ku iya zama kusa da shi ba tare da jin shi ba.
No wonder no one likes it.	Ba mamaki babu mai son shi.
Please, let us try.	Don Allah, bari mu gwada.
I know this because everyone is telling everyone how good he is.	Na san wannan saboda kowa yana gaya wa kowa yadda yake da kyau.
And it was so delicious.	Kuma ya kasance mai dadi sosai.
Some people are afraid to go out at night alone.	Wasu mutane suna tsoron tafiya su kadai da dare.
And it’s not fake, right.	Kuma ba karya ba ne, daidai.
Now let him go, and take me home.	Yanzu bari ya tafi, kuma ku kai ni gida.
In fact more than others.	A gaskiya fiye da wasu.
He was right about one thing.	Yayi gaskiya akan abu daya.
Someone might say it's over.	Wani zai iya cewa ya gama.
He slept a little.	Ya dan yi barci kadan.
They are not even lost.	Ba a ma rasa su ba.
She used to tell everyone to die.	Ta kasance tana gaya wa kowa ya mutu.
You eat what you spend.	Kuna ci abin da kuka kashe.
He went three times.	Ya tafi sau uku.
Inside then down.	Ciki sai kasa.
If you think of something else, you do not know it very well.	Idan kuna tsammanin wani abu kuma, ba ku san shi sosai ba.
No one will believe you.	Ba wanda zai yarda da ku.
For now, things will be just as they were.	A yanzu, abubuwa za su kasance kamar yadda suke.
I didn’t really think about it.	Ban yi tunani sosai game da shi ba.
This can be done in the future.	Ana iya yin wannan a gaba.
Or you just can't reach them.	Ko kuma kawai ba za ku iya isa gare su ba.
Open lunch and dinner.	Bude abincin rana da abincin dare.
But he was worried.	Amma ya damu.
Not what they are known for.	Ba abin da aka san su da shi ba.
They did me really good.	Sun yi min kyau sosai.
Honestly, let me check this out.	A gaskiya, bari in duba wannan.
That never happened to me.	Hakan bai taba faruwa da ni ba.
Or not really.	Ko ba da gaske ba.
I play the best.	Ina wasa mafi kyau.
It's a really nice place.	Wuri ne mai kyau sosai.
There is.	Akwai.
To take advantage of this opportunity, you must hurry.	Don amfani da wannan damar, dole ne ku yi sauri.
If you are caught, you will not feel good.	Idan an kama ku, ba za ku ji daɗi ba.
You can not do anything with it.	Ba za ku iya yin komai da shi ba.
Let's go outside for a while.	Mu fito waje na dan wani lokaci.
She did something she wanted to do.	Ta yi wani abu da take son yi.
It is a useful food.	Mai amfani abinci ne.
I have to go check things out.	Dole ne in je duba abubuwa.
Maybe come back for more.	Wataƙila za a dawo don samun ƙarin.
Honestly, not heard.	Gaskiya, ba ji ba.
You may eventually fall asleep.	Kuna iya yin barci a ƙarshe.
Many say he can read intelligently.	Mutane da yawa sun ce zai iya karanta hankali.
Please let me have a drink.	Don Allah bari in sha ruwa.
He could not speak for a while.	Ya kasa magana na d'an lokaci.
We will have a weekend there.	Za mu yi karshen mako a can.
The other players are weak.	Sauran 'yan wasan suna da rauni.
One time please.	Lokaci guda don Allah.
But it has to be done !.	Amma dole a yi!.
I like that with it.	Ina son hakan tare da shi.
That's it, however.	Shi ke nan, duk da haka.
It's two bucks.	Kudi biyu ne.
And it was a good night.	Kuma dare ne mai kyau.
That sounds like an interesting problem.	Wannan yana kama da matsala mai ban sha'awa.
As such.	Kamar haka.
It is good to know.	Abu ne mai kyau a sani.
They have to take a job.	Dole ne su dauki wani aiki.
I can do that, you know.	Zan iya yin hakan, ka sani.
I am happy about that.	Na yi farin ciki da hakan.
I was cut off from him, you covered.	An yanke ni daga gare shi, ka rufe.
But it gives him the tools to succeed.	Amma yana ba shi kayan aikin don samun nasara.
No one liked the project from the beginning.	Babu wanda ya so aikin tun daga farko.
Think about things.	Ka yi tunani a kan abubuwa.
During.	A lokacin.
They paid her to do it for me.	Sun biya ta ta yi ni .
Let me not let you go.	Kada in bar ku ku tafi.
But no, it helped.	Amma babu, ya taimaka.
Everyone was surprised.	Kowa yayi mamaki.
To other people.	Zuwa wasu mutane.
Looking scared.	Kallon tsoro.
Just let it be.	Kawai bari ya kasance.
Just go and do it.	Kawai je ku yi haka.
Keep going and you will get there.	Ci gaba da shi za ku isa can.
Give it to them.	Ka ba shi su.
I can imagine it is.	Ina iya tunanin yana da.
Go out to get you.	Fita don samun ku.
The restaurant offers delicious food.	Gidan cin abinci yana ba da abinci mai daɗi.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	Yi hakuri, ba hakuri.
You can take good care of yourself.	Kuna iya kula da kanku da kyau.
Someone wanted to know something.	Wani ya so ya san wani abu.
Think about it.	Tunani game da shi.
I have more than that.	Ina da fiye da haka.
And sometimes that is a good way to work.	Kuma wani lokacin wannan hanya ce mai kyau don aiki.
You did not come.	Ba ku zo ba.
It does not contradict everything you stand for.	Ba ya saba wa duk abin da kuka tsaya a kai.
Don't be this person.	Kar ka zama mutumin nan.
But they are not happy.	Amma ba su ji daɗi ba.
It's true.	Gaskiya ne.
You two.	Ku biyu ne.
We are the only way to the end.	Mu ne kawai hanyar zuwa ƙarshe.
Be about it.	Ku kasance game da shi.
This surprised us.	Wannan ya ba mu mamaki.
It is definitely an interesting study.	Tabbas karatu ne mai ban sha'awa.
One can hope !.	Mutum zai iya fata!.
Now, let's talk about the real world.	Yanzu, bari mu yi magana game da ainihin duniya.
You will not die.	Ba za ku mutu ba.
Tell him how it is.	Ka gaya masa yadda abin yake.
I really hope this.	Ina fatan wannan sosai.
I wouldn’t mind it.	Ba zan damu da shi ba.
But he never got an answer.	Amma bai taba samun amsa ba.
It was a difficult time.	Lokaci ne mai wahala.
I certainly didn’t do much.	Lallai ban yi yawa ba.
He was with someone.	Ya kasance tare da wani.
It continues over the years.	Yana ci gaba a cikin shekaru.
But he didn't care.	Amma bai damu ba.
No one got up and gave him a seat.	Ba wanda ya tashi ya ba shi wurin zama.
We don't even have to talk to each other.	Ba ma sai mun yi magana da juna ba.
He did it again.	Ya sake yi.
I care about watching you.	Na damu da kallon ku.
The thought went wrong.	Tunanin yayi kuskure.
He started to get up.	Ya fara tashi.
Try not to drink too much.	Gwada kar a sha mai yawa.
But you can see a lot.	Amma kuna iya gani da yawa.
The right way here is the best.	Hanyar da ta dace a nan da ta fi kyau.
This is very difficult for me.	Wannan yana da wuya a gare ni.
They immediately came and went.	Nan da nan suka zo suka tafi.
They worked very well together.	Sun yi aiki sosai tare.
We’ve all met her kind.	Duk mun hadu da irin ta.
I need to start earning money, right away.	Ina bukata in fara samun kuɗi, nan take.
Amazing things are happening.	Abubuwa masu ban mamaki suna faruwa.
I did not travel.	Ban yi tafiya ba.
We are sleeping this game.	Muna barci wannan wasan.
I'm not very good at it.	Bani da kyau sosai.
I can see why.	Zan iya ganin dalilin da ya sa.
But just for the moment.	Amma kawai don lokacin.
He, too, decided to do the right thing.	Shi ma, ya yanke shawarar yin daidai.
I finally arrived and really enjoyed it.	A ƙarshe na isa kuma na ji daɗi sosai.
Don't worry, let me find it.	Kada ku damu, bari in sami shi.
This is something that is right.	Wannan wani abu ne da ya yi daidai.
I am not very helpful to the police.	Ba ni da taimako sosai ga 'yan sanda.
Close it.	Rufe shi.
I think they get pleasure from it.	Ina tsammanin suna samun farin ciki daga ciki.
Ask whatever you want.	Tambayi duk abin da kuke so.
I was worried about myself.	Na damu da kaina.
Your problem is to get someone to accept it.	Matsalar ku ita ce ku sa wani ya yarda da shi.
He committed suicide.	Ya kashe kansa.
He wanted to make this movie.	Ya so ya yi wannan fim.
How sad to think.	Yaya bakin ciki don tunani.
It was a great effort, of course.	Da ya kasance babban ƙoƙari, ba shakka.
If you keep driving, you will kill someone.	Idan ka ci gaba da tuƙi, za ka kashe wani.
Money is not a thing.	Kudi ba abu bane.
You will say you are, but they will laugh.	Za ku ce kai ne, amma za su yi dariya.
And take the money with you.	A kuma dauki kudi tare da shi.
Not everyone was happy.	Ba kowa ya ji daɗi ba.
The shirt was completely removed.	Gaba daya an cire rigar.
Come back and do three.	Dawo da yi uku.
I can make metal too.	Zan iya yin karfe kuma.
You know where you eat lunch every day.	Kun san wurin da kuke cin abincin rana kowace rana.
He never lost a cigarette.	Bai rasa taba ba.
That's what they say.	Haka suke cewa.
I killed him.	Na kashe shi.
Are you in pain?	Kuna jin zafi?
I will prepare a place for you.	Zan shirya muku wuri.
It is a work of life.	Aiki ne na rayuwa.
I don't feel like we're there yet.	Ba na jin cewa muna can tukuna.
And we did.	Kuma mun yi haka.
Many people get sick every year.	Mutane da yawa suna tashi da rashin lafiya kowace shekara.
Try it for a while.	Gwada shi dan lokaci.
We will start from the end and go back.	Za mu fara daga ƙarshe kuma mu koma baya.
Walk very fast.	Yi tafiya da sauri sosai.
No wonder.	Babu mamaki.
Open it and read.	Bude shi ka karanta.
You know how they are.	Kun san yadda suke.
I want to stay in the house.	Ina so in zauna a gidan.
He did what he thought he would do.	Ya yi abin da zai yi tunanin zai yi.
She left her on what she wanted.	Ta bar ta a kan abin da ta ke so.
But there you guys are.	Amma akwai ku yara.
I heard her too.	Na ji ita ma.
I am very sad to read about this.	Ina matukar bakin ciki karanta game da wannan.
It comes from less than everything.	Ya zo daga kasa da komai.
You can leave yourself.	Kuna iya barin kanku.
But beauty is better.	Amma kyau ya fi kyau.
Immediately the door opened.	Nan take kofar ta bude.
But there can be no doubt about it.	Amma ba za a iya ƙara yin shakka game da shi ba.
Which they will not do.	Wanda ba za su yi ba.
Behind him are two others.	Bayan shi kuma wasu biyu ne.
I do not know what can happen to me yet.	Ban san abin da zai iya faruwa da ni ba tukuna.
I wondered how long it would take.	Na yi mamakin tsawon lokacin da zai dauka.
They often speak quickly to me.	Sau da yawa suna magana da sauri a gare ni.
He says that is not fair.	Ya ce hakan bai dace ba.
But you are good.	Amma kuna da kyau.
Now is the time we need them.	Yanzu ne lokacin da muke bukatar su.
Just something.	Kawai wani abu.
That made a lot of sense.	Hakan ya sa hankali sosai.
He did it.	Ya yi shi.
Never doubt.	Kada ka taba shakka.
It's good.	Yana da kyau.
I want him to be in this too.	Ina son shi ma ya kasance cikin wannan.
We can hope.	Muna iya fata.
I told her it would.	Na ce mata zai yi.
If so, you will be wrong.	Idan haka ne, za ku yi kuskure.
And it closes.	Kuma yana rufe.
Whatever happens, will happen.	Duk abin da zai faru, zai faru.
Now we see more.	Yanzu mun kara gani.
I can't talk to everyone.	Ba zan iya magana ga kowa da kowa ba.
It really looks like simple.	Da gaske ya yi kama da sauƙi.
That's what he does.	Haka yake yi.
One time to save it, another to show it.	Sau ɗaya don ajiye shi, wani don nuna shi.
She has no room for anything.	Ba ta da dakin wani abu.
I did well with it.	Na yi kyau da shi.
Everyone is sad.	Kowa yana bakin ciki.
I saw the article.	Na ga labarin.
She told us what she had done.	Ta gaya mana abin da ta yi.
They are shown.	Ana nuna su.
I look at them.	Ina kallon su.
The next night.	Dare mai zuwa kuma.
She already knew.	Ta riga ta gane.
Some are faster than others.	Wasu sauri fiye da wasu.
Very efficient.	Yadda ya dace sosai.
This is true.	Wannan gaskiya ne.
I tested mine.	Na gwada nawa.
What he says may not be true.	Abin da yake faɗa ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
She was sure.	Ta kasance tabbas.
There must be a better way.	Dole ne a sami hanya mafi kyau.
We will do it because it needs to be done.	Za mu yi shi saboda yana bukatar a yi.
Self-awareness is greater, greater than any feeling.	Sanin kai ya fi girma, girma fiye da kowane ji.
But sometimes not as it seems.	Amma wani lokacin babu kamar yadda ake gani.
I will never eat.	Ba zan taba ci ba.
No such thing is necessary.	Babu irin wannan abu ya zama dole.
Come one by one.	Ku zo daya bayan daya.
Of course I can get it.	Tabbas zan iya samu.
He could be a god.	Zai iya zama allah.
It feels cold.	Yana jin sanyi.
I don't think it will.	Bana jin zai yi.
Bring me back.	Kawo min kayan baya.
I was careful.	Na yi hankali.
He did not answer me immediately.	Bai amsa min ba nan take.
I want to make this my career somehow.	Ina so in mai da wannan aiki na ko ta yaya.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
But it is not enough.	Amma bai isa ba.
This day is not today.	Wannan ranar ba yau ba ce.
Do you need help? 	Kuna buƙatar taimako?
We will get back to him.	Za mu dawo gare shi.
If she doesn't, people will die.	Idan ba ta shiga ba, mutane za su mutu.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
He did not say so.	Bai ce haka ba.
He played with the thought of laughter.	Ya yi wasa da tunanin dariya.
Only once.	Sau ɗaya kawai.
They work for me.	Suna yi min aiki.
There is a surprise.	Akwai abin mamaki.
He is here now.	Yana nan a yanzu.
I did not cry.	Ban yi kuka ba.
So be careful!	Don haka a kula!
However, that is also a problem.	Duk da haka, hakan ma matsala ce.
They just told him to stay close.	Sai kawai suka ce masa ya zauna kusa.
I enjoyed such.	Na ji daɗi irin wannan.
The article may have been written about them.	Wataƙila an rubuta labarin game da su.
Please read on and enjoy it.	Da fatan za ku karanta kuma ku so shi.
So there it is.	Don haka akwai haka.
Get up inside.	Tashi su ciki.
I saw you look at my morning dress.	Na ga ka kalli rigar safe ta.
I don't know if.	Ban sani ba ko.
He had to catch something.	Dole ne ya kama wani abu.
It’s about me, not her.	Game da ni ne, ba ita ba.
He is the third.	Shine na uku.
She, too, does not care about life.	Ita ma bata damu da rayuwa ba.
He became a thinker.	Ya zama mai tunani daya.
You need more work.	Kuna buƙatar ƙarin aiki.
Of course he expressed himself.	Tabbas ya bayyana kansa.
He just wants to talk to her.	Magana kawai yake son yi mata.
Everything is ready.	An shirya komai.
It led me down a sad path though.	Ta kai ni hanya ta bakin ciki ko.
I will not use them.	Ba zan yi amfani da su ba.
Everyone has a problem.	Kowa ya sami matsala.
It is not enough.	Bai isa ba.
I have one statement.	Ina da magana daya.
But, not in a hurry to read.	Amma, ba da sauri don karatu ba.
That's what they do.	Abin da suke yi ke nan.
Do you remember how we played?	Kuna tuna yadda muke wasa?
Just forget you will never need to do that.	Kawai manta za ku taɓa buƙatar yin hakan.
She failed.	Ta kasa kasa.
I think he saw we were gone.	Ina tsammanin ya ga mun tafi.
This, too, will not work.	Wannan kuma, ba zai yi aiki ba.
He was, is it.	Ya kasance, shi ne.
It can be cold.	Yana iya zama sanyi.
He could not sit still.	Ya kasa zama har yanzu.
Less than the best.	Kasa da mafi kyau.
It is true today.	Ya kasance gaskiya a yau.
He left it.	Ya bar shi.
But he does not stay there.	Amma baya zama a wurin.
I have never seen the place.	Ban taba ganin wurin ba.
I don't want to do it again.	Ba na so in sake yin hakan.
Maybe he didn't have to do anything.	Wataƙila ba lallai ne ya yi komai ba.
I do not know how to do it.	Ban san yadda zan yi ba.
Undoubtedly, there will be more suicides.	Babu shakka, za a sami ƙarin kashe kansa.
So go ahead.	Don haka ci gaba.
Here is a way to think about it.	Ga hanyar yin tunani game da shi.
The cut is here.	Yanke yana nan.
After a while, something happens to someone else.	Bayan wani lokaci, wani abu ya kai ga wani.
What you are saying now.	Abin da kuke fada yanzu.
We do not have.	Ba mu da.
Everyone is talking about a new restaurant.	Kowa yana magana game da sabon gidan abincin.
One person.	Mutum daya .
Where are they?	Ina suke?.
She does not like this dog.	Ba ta son wannan kare.
Check it out, if you like.	Duba shi, idan kuna so.
I am suffering now, he said.	Ina shan wahala yanzu, in ji shi.
Finally, everyone left.	A ƙarshe, kowa ya tafi.
He did not think.	Bai yi tunani ba.
This woman is accused of lying.	Ana zargin wannan mata da karya.
I picked it up.	Na daga shi.
And she knows that you can.	Kuma ta san cewa za ku iya.
They discovered each other's interests.	Sun gano sha'awar juna.
They can only imagine.	Sun iya tunanin kawai.
Many people will want to stay with you.	Mutane da yawa za su so su zauna tare da ku.
It takes a lot of time.	Yana ɗaukar lokaci mai yawa.
But there are others.	Amma akwai kuma wasu.
She laughed, and he joined her.	Ta yi dariya, shi kuma ya tare ta.
This can be done quickly.	Ana iya yin wannan da sauri.
And he knows that will make them love him even more.	Kuma ya san hakan ya sa su ƙara son sa.
One year we had a very nice guy.	Shekara guda muna da wani mutum wanda yake da kyau sosai.
Fans of this game are still here.	Masu sha'awar wannan wasa har yanzu suna nan.
I got one right away.	Na samu wani nan take.
You have to keep trying to get a job.	Dole ne ku ci gaba da ƙoƙarin ku don samun aiki.
I thought so.	Na dauka haka ne.
Leave to cool completely.	Bar don yin sanyi gaba daya.
Very much so.	Sosai ma.
How interesting!	Yaya ban sha'awa!
Something unlike them.	Wani abu ba kamar su ba.
The door is open.	Kofar a bude take.
I'm thinking of this.	Ina tunanin wannan.
Have fun, kids !.	Ku ji daɗi, yara!.
I love it, a lot.	Ina son shi, da yawa.
It kind of works.	Ya irin aiki.
I want to know where it came from.	Ina so in san daga ina ya fito.
He does not talk to anyone, and he is always alone.	Ba ya magana da kowa, kuma kullum shi kaɗai yake.
This work is unrealistic.	Wannan aikin ba shi da gaskiya.
Think what you want.	Yi tunanin abin da kuke so.
She needed to laugh.	Ta bukata ta yi dariya.
Anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar.	Duk wanda ya ce maka ba haka ba, karya ne.
They have to think that she got involved somehow.	Dole ne su yi tunanin cewa ta shiga cikin ko ta yaya.
You are beautiful.	Kuna da kyau.
And he does.	Kuma yana yi.
There are some good things about it.	Akwai wasu abubuwa masu kyau game da shi.
I never told you.	Ban taba gaya muku ba.
It will describe the amount of drink.	Zai bayyana yawan abin sha.
He is coming here.	Yana zuwa nan.
They want to make the world a better place.	Suna son sanya duniya ta zama wuri mafi kyau.
They will not play with it.	Ba za su yi wasa da shi ba.
Suddenly two policemen came out.	Da sauri ‘yan sanda biyu suka fito.
But it is of no use.	Amma ba wani amfani ba ne.
Don't think too hard.	Kar ka yi tunani sosai.
I think this is a good sign.	Ina ganin wannan alama ce mai kyau.
This person wants something.	Wannan mutumin yana son wani abu.
Yet surprisingly or not, it is a problem.	Amma duk da haka abin mamaki ko a'a, matsala ce.
As far as you are concerned, there is none.	Kamar yadda ka damu, babu shi.
She wants to be outside.	Tana son zama a waje.
I will not ask you twice.	Ba zan tambaye ku sau biyu ba.
He heard.	Ya ji.
You are almost there.	Kusan kuna can da gaske.
It is indeed a source of great joy.	Lallai abin farin ciki ne sosai.
I stopped running.	Na daina gudu.
She doesn't feel very comfortable.	Ba ta jin dadi sosai.
Just look at them.	Kallon su kawai.
You're done.	Kun gama.
They can save it.	Za su iya ajiye shi.
He never started anything but her.	Bai taba fara komai ba sai ita.
It did not come easily.	Bai zo da sauƙi ba.
But they don't do anything like that.	Amma ba su yin komai irin wannan.
If it is safe for you, I am.	Idan lafiya ce a gare ku, ni ne.
Simple speech here and there.	Magana mai sauƙi nan da can.
Next year, no.	A shekara ta gaba, babu.
She's just a kid.	Yaro ce kawai.
Can you prepare dinner tonight?	Za a iya shirya abinci yau da dare?
It looks like you're on an amazing trip.	Ga alama kuna tafiya mai ban mamaki.
Then trouble arose.	Sai wahala ta tashi.
I'm talking to him tonight.	Ina magana da shi a daren nan.
He felt like a child.	Ya ji kamar yaro.
Which, of course, happened.	Wanda, ba shakka, ya faru.
Not new.	Ba sabon abu ba.
I live	ina zaune
I'm not really interested.	Ba ni da sha'awar gaske.
No one can explain it.	Babu wanda zai iya bayyana shi.
I want to explain that.	Ina so in bayyana hakan.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
It's two games.	Wasa biyu ne.
I know you think so.	Da na san kuna tunanin haka.
She started talking around it, you know.	Ta fara magana a kusa da shi, ka sani.
Send it out.	Aika shi waje.
The story goes like this.	Labarin ya tafi kamar haka.
Other than that there is nothing to say about it.	Baya ga haka babu abin da za a ce game da shi.
She knocked on the door.	Ta buga kofar.
We work for you.	Muna yi muku aiki.
Someone else altogether.	Wani ne gaba ɗaya.
I have used it all over the years without any problems.	Na yi amfani da duka tsawon shekaru ba tare da matsala ba.
I can't wait to see anything.	Ba zan iya jira in ga komai ba.
Third.	Na uku.
But they do.	Amma suna yi.
Many things can go wrong.	Abubuwa da yawa na iya yin kuskure.
It was used.	An yi amfani da shi.
Be careful with that.	Yi hankali da wannan.
It can go on and on.	Zai iya ci gaba da ci gaba.
But we are doing everything we can to make it stand out.	Amma muna yin duk abin da za mu iya don ganin ta tsaya.
Everyone knows you are here and knows the real story.	Kowa ya san kana nan kuma ya san ainihin labarin.
A simple laugh for us too.	Abin dariya mai sauƙi a gare mu mana.
They are not right.	Ba su yi daidai ba.
We must come to him.	Dole ne mu zo gare shi.
But he continued.	Amma ya ci gaba.
If only something.	Idan kawai wani abu.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
We do not have to go beyond that.	Ba sai mun wuce haka ba.
How long has it been.	Tun yaushe ya kasance.
There is nothing to do.	Babu wani abu da za a yi.
He could not imagine a better life.	Ba zai iya tunanin rayuwa mafi kyau ba.
I should go.	Ni ne ya kamata in tafi.
They are part of their identity.	Suna daga cikin ainihin su.
Try it and see what happens.	Gwada shi ku ga abin da ya faru.
They seem to be different.	Ga alama sun saba.
It feels good to be healthy.	Da kyau a ji suna da lafiya.
They don't even know you are here.	Ba su ma san kana nan ba.
I have one.	Ina da daya.
Maybe he did.	Wataƙila ya yi.
Everyone uses it.	Kowa yana amfani da shi.
Such may be, or may not.	Irin wannan na iya zama, ko kuma a'a.
We do a lot back on people.	Mun yi yawa baya a kan mutane.
We didn't say much either.	Mu ma ba mu ce da yawa ba.
She would tell him.	Zata gaya masa.
And we have everything, you know.	Kuma muna da komai, ka sani.
They seem to have found something worthwhile to try.	Da alama sun ga wani abu da ya dace da ƙoƙarin.
Nothing now.	Ba komai yanzu.
We should not continue until we are ready to move forward.	Bai kamata mu ci gaba ba har sai mun shirya gaba.
We will not do that.	Ba za mu yi hakan ba.
He will know.	Zai sani.

This is happening.	Wannan yana faruwa.
Someone got it.	Wani ya samu.

You can buy them or make them.	Kuna iya saya su ko yin su.
The moon rose.	Wata ya tashi sama.
Be more careful, he said.	A kara kula, in ji shi.
But that is not right.	Amma hakan ba daidai ba ne.
They spoke to anyone interested.	Sun yi magana da duk mai sha'awar.
Maybe not the future.	Wataƙila ba gaba ba ne.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
Hurry up boy.	Yi sauri yaro.
There is still no answer.	Har yanzu babu amsa.
We came, we saw, he was dead.	Mun zo, mun gani, ya mutu.
One person was injured.	Mutum daya ya ji rauni.
It always makes you feel like you did something wrong.	Koyaushe sanya ku ji kamar kun yi wani abu ba daidai ba.

He thought a lot about that.	Ya yi tunani sosai a kan haka.

Perhaps some have done so.	Wataƙila wasu sun yi haka.
Now the car is moving safely.	Yanzu motar tana tafiya lafiya.
They took care of us.	Sun kula da mu.
He is dead.	Ya mutu.
You came here just in time.	Kun zo nan daidai lokacin.
But he had to figure things out on his own.	Amma ya zama dole ya gano abubuwa da kan sa.
Students will eat whatever they can carry.	'Yan makaranta za su ci duk abin da za su iya ɗauka.
It was time to do something to protect her.	Lokaci ya yi da ya yi wani abu don ya kare ta.

You've got another.	Kun sami wani.
We are also human.	Mu ma mutane ne.
She did not know how she knew this.	Ba ta san yadda ta san wannan ba.

However, she never asked for help.	Duk da haka, ba ta taɓa neman taimako ba.
We did not pass by.	Ba mu wuce wurin ba.
She pretended she had it all.	Ta yi kamar tana da shi duka.
This is an opportunity.	Wannan dama ce.
She can come with me.	Zata iya zuwa da ni.
But after about a week he began to feel better.	Amma bayan kamar mako guda ya fara samun sauƙi.
You can use the money to get someone to write.	Kuna iya amfani da kuɗi don samun wani ya rubuta.

It cannot be done without you.	Ba za a iya yi ba tare da ku ba.
The plane is ready to take off.	Jirgin ya shirya zai tashi.

This should not happen to anyone else.	Bai kamata wannan ya faru da wani ba.

What is good for them is good for everyone.	Abin da yake da kyau a gare su yana da kyau ga kowa.
To lose it would be to lose them.	Don rasa shi zai zama rasa su.
Hope to see the teacher soon.	Da fatan za a ga malamin nan da nan.
Probably not the first time everyone has used it.	Tabbas ba shine karo na farko da kowa ke amfani da shi ba.
That way, you only need to print them once.	Ta wannan hanyar, kuna buƙatar buga su sau ɗaya kawai.
However, his decision did not go unnoticed.	Duk da haka, shawarar da ya yanke bai yi farin ciki ba.
She wanted them all.	Ta so su duka.
If we had shown fear we would have gotten into trouble.	Da mun nuna tsoro da mun shiga matsala.

The mind returns, but returns to the true thoughts.	Hankali ya dawo, amma ya dawo cikin tunani na gaskiya.
He got the right name.	Ya sami sunan gaskiya.
He is one of the workers.	Yana cikin masu aiki.

So he misled himself.	Don haka ya bata kansa.

She could not think.	Ta kasa tunani.
Show you what you have.	Nuna muku abin da yake da ku.

In this there is no doubt.	A cikin wannan babu mai shakka.
It is one thing.	Yana daga cikin abu daya.
Please check back if you remember correctly.	Da fatan za a duba idan kun tuna daidai.
I would not have stayed.	Da ban zauna ba.
He was useful to them in every way.	Ya kasance mai amfani gare su ta kowace hanya.
The place is there, he said.	Wurin yana nan, in ji shi.
I can't watch that.	Ba zan iya kallon hakan ba.
But let me start with you.	Amma bari in fara da ku.
That's how we wrote it.	Haka muka rubuta shi.
I do not want to see what is there.	Ba na son ganin abin da ke can.
It has changed, honestly, but in a positive way.	Ya canza, gaskiya, amma a hanya mai kyau.
You think nothing of it.	Ba kuna tunanin komai ba.
Still, he did not give up.	Amma duk da haka, bai daina ba.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Babu wani abu da ba daidai ba.
In fact it turns it on.	A gaskiya yana kunna ta.
But it was too cold.	Amma ya yi sanyi.
As always buy back.	Kamar yadda koyaushe saya zuwa baya.
I don't want that to be me.	Ba na son hakan ya zama ni.
He can recognize it.	Zai iya gane shi.
You are not imagined.	Ba a yi tunanin kai ba.
And he does not even know where they are.	Kuma bai ma san inda suke ba.
He began to do other things.	Ya fara yin wasu abubuwa.
One day he loves this house.	Wata rana yana son gidan nan.
Please do not forget this.	Don Allah kar a manta da hakan.
I can see that when it works.	Ina iya ganin hakan lokacin da yake aiki.
It felt like one could.	Ya ji kamar mutum zai iya.
Not so there.	Ba haka ba a can.
I can't find anything.	Ba zan iya samun komai ba.

Yes, we need more help.	Zai kasance, muna buƙatar ƙarin taimako.
They may not be well.	Wataƙila ba su da lafiya.
What works for you today, may not work tomorrow.	Abin da ke aiki a gare ku a yau, watakila ba zai yi aiki ba gobe.
You can watch it.	Kuna iya kallon shi.
He inherited money, he spent.	Ya gaji kudi, ya kashe.
People are still down there.	Har yanzu mutane suna can kasa.
What's this?	Menene wannan?
How long before is unknown.	Har yaushe kafin ba a sani ba.
They led us to this victory.	Sun kai mu ga wannan nasara.

Hurry up, we are already late.	Yi sauri, mun riga mun makara.
He died, in a way.	Ya mutu, a wata hanya.
They just have to be.	Sun zama dole ne kawai.
I don’t know, maybe just something she can do.	Ban sani ba, watakila wani abu ne kawai za ta iya yi.
So they got up and left immediately.	Don haka sai suka tashi su tafi nan take.
He does not smoke.	Ba ya shan taba.
She will never do anything to you again.	Ba za ta sake yi maka komai ba.
You can see for yourself.	Kuna iya gani da kanku.
We don’t have players like that.	Ba mu da 'yan wasa da irin wannan.
It's too hot.	Ranar zafi sosai.
I think the two of you are very close.	Ina tsammanin ku biyu kuna kusa sosai.
We talked.	Mun yi magana.
Not exactly, as we shall see, but it looks like.	Ba daidai ba ne, kamar yadda za mu gani, amma kama.
But he failed.	Amma ya kasa.
Go to him.	Ka je gare shi.

You know, it's really good at this point.	Ka sani, yana da kyau sosai a wannan lokacin.

I feel bad about that.	Na ji ba dadi game da hakan.
I do not like it.	Ba na son shi.
He should be happy.	Ya kamata ya yi farin ciki.
I feel how cold it finally is.	Ina jin yadda ta yi sanyi a ƙarshe.
Prepare food for tonight.	Shirya abinci don daren yau.
She knew nothing of the heat.	Ba ta san komai na zafi ba.
I don't care about that.	Ban damu da wannan ba.
Please? 	Don Allah?
They have no food.	Ba su da abinci.
I'm better now.	Na fi kyau yanzu.
They are only looking for what they are worried about.	Suna neman abin da suka damu ne kawai.
Where is this restaurant?	Ina wannan gidan cin abinci?
But we do not know this by the way.	Amma ba mu san hakan a hanya ba.
No one else was on board.	Babu wanda kuma ya ci gaba da tafiya a cikin jirgin.
Only two players are playing.	Yan wasa biyu ne ke buga wasan.
No one talked about how to fix it.	Ba wanda ya yi magana game da yadda za a gyara shi.
She said she was not sure.	Ta ce ba ta da tabbas.
Two things have changed.	Abubuwa biyu sun canza.
It is something they cannot even imagine.	Wani abu ne ma ba za su iya tunanin ba.
I’ve never seen anything like it in a movie.	Ban taba samun irin wannan a fim ba.
I will call him whatever they want.	Zan kira shi duk abin da suke so.
It will be here.	Zai kasance a nan.
Let them not know.	Kada su sani.
Now for the good stuff.	Yanzu ga kayan da kyau.

And this is a terrible thing.	Kuma wannan mummunan abu ne.
You have to decide how much it can take.	Dole ne ku yanke shawarar nawa zai iya ɗauka.
I can come now, however, to let you sleep.	Zan iya zuwa yanzu, duk da haka, in bar ku ku yi barci.
We will be glad to assist you.	Za mu yi farin cikin taimaka muku.
He laughed to himself.	Ya yi wa kansa dariya.
There is nothing less and nothing less.	Babu wani abu kasa kuma babu wani abu.

He said something, she said something.	Ya ce wani abu, ta ce wani abu.
This is just a fact.	Wannan gaskiya ce kawai.
He hit him down.	Ya buga masa kasa.
Give this article.	Ba da wannan labarin.
That seems strange, isn't it?	Hakan da alama ba daidai ba ne, ko ba haka ba?
I'm saying talk to me.	Ina cewa magana da ni.
When they are happy, they cannot think.	Lokacin da suka ji daɗi, ba za su iya yin tunani ba.
No, you can.	A'a, za ku iya yi.
Some do not fly.	Wasu ba sa tashi.
After that he spoke all the time.	Bayan haka ya yi magana a kowane lokaci.
Even for two years I did not hear from you.	Ko da shekara biyu ban ji daga gare ku ba.
But somehow she would do it.	Amma ko ta yaya za ta yi hakan.
In fact I could not confirm what would happen then.	A gaskiya na kasa tabbatar da abin da zai faru a lokacin.
No one slept well.	Babu wanda ya yi barci mai kyau.
And that will be just what it is.	Kuma abin da zai zama kawai sabon abin da yake.
I am almost sick.	Ina kusan rashin lafiya.
And almost at the same time.	Kuma kusan lokaci ɗaya ya yi.
She wanted to so she wasn’t there.	Ta so don haka ba ta kasance a wurin ba.
I do not feel comfortable.	Ba na jin dadi.
This surprised me.	Wannan ya ba ni mamaki.
They have never been married.	Ba a taɓa yin aure ba.
Progress is guaranteed.	An tabbatar da ci gaba.
There is nothing that we cannot do together.	Babu abin da ba za mu iya yin aiki tare ba.
I need to write to her back.	Ina bukata in rubuta mata baya.
He was always human.	Ya kasance mutum ne kullum.
Who will pay for this?	Wanene zai biya wannan?

But this is a mistake.	Amma wannan kuskure ne.
So, with it.	Don haka, tare da shi.
So delicious, as usual.	Don haka dadi, kamar yadda aka saba.
I hope to do that.	Ina fatan yin hakan.
I was the only one in the car.	Ni kadai ne a cikin motar.
When you are ready, go back to school.	Idan kun shirya, koma makaranta.
It may not be what she wants, but she does it.	Ba zai iya zama abin da take so ba, amma ta yi hakan.
You won't even want to.	Ba za ku ma so ba.
What happened will never happen again.	Abin da ya faru ba zai sake faruwa ba.

It will not help you to have girls.	Ba zai taimaka muku samun 'yan mata ba.
He didn’t stop around.	Bai tsaya a kusa ba.
This is filled with interest.	Wannan ya cika kan sha'awa.
Good things come to those who wait!	Abubuwa masu kyau suna zuwa ga masu jira!.
It was never expected today that it would be so difficult.	Ba a taɓa tsammanin yau zai yi wahala haka ba.
Some readers have heard the story is negative.	Wasu masu karatu sun ji labarin ba shi da kyau.

The ground is not good.	Kasa ba ta da kyau.
You would have died	Da kun mutu

Furniture in the rest of the house.	Kayan da ke cikin sauran gidan.
John enters the house through the back door.	John ya shiga gidan ta kofar baya.
Talk and talk.	Magana da magana.

Something still did not feel right.	Wani abu har yanzu bai ji daidai ba.

No one is in it.	Babu kowa a ciki.
Leaving the road.	Barin hanya.

Some have it, some don’t.	Wasu suna da shi, wasu ba su da shi.
They just went out and did as they pleased.	Sai kawai suka fita suka yi yadda suka ga dama.
That's what he hoped for.	Abin da ya yi fata kenan.

We were close.	Mun kasance kusa.
She wanted to move on.	Ta so ya yi gaba.
And before.	Kuma kafin.
That's what we did.	Haka muka yi.
I know they closed the story.	Na san sun rufe labarin.
They have to write something bad.	Dole ne su rubuta mummunan abu.
I saw this.	Na ga wannan.
The police will still want you and me there.	'Yan sanda za su so ni da ku a can tukuna.
I think they saw enough, because no one was around.	Ina tsammanin sun ga isa, don babu kowa a kusa.
To be forgotten.	Don a manta.
I really like you very much.	A gaskiya ina son ku sosai.
He raised one hand.	Ya daga hannu daya.
I know this will come as a surprise to you.	Na san wannan zai zo muku da mamaki.
He doesn't feel anything.	Ba ya jin komai.
Let her do this.	Bari ta yi wannan.
That was the only time.	Wannan shine kawai lokacin.
It has been an amazing week.	Ya kasance mako mai ban mamaki.
He is just a human being.	Mutum ne kawai.
I must know.	Dole ne in sani.
I do not expect to be this person.	Ba na fatan zama wannan mutumin.
The second is when we buy any beverage.	Na biyu shine lokacin da muka sayi duk wani abin sha.
Maybe not for you but for me.	Wataƙila ba don ku ba amma a gare ni.
The project was unsuccessful.	Aikin bai yi nasara ba.
He grabbed her gently.	Ya kama ta a hankali.
Like any job, you never know how it will work.	Kamar kowane aiki, ba ku taɓa sanin yadda zai yi aiki ba.
The man knows what he is doing.	Mutumin ya san abin da yake yi.
I do not want them around me.	Ba na son su kusa da ni.
They must be arrested immediately.	Dole ne a kama su nan take.

The trip closed.	Tafiya suka rufe.
But it is difficult.	Amma yana da wuya.
If you accept it please sign your name.	Idan kun yarda da shi don Allah sanya hannu akan sunan ku.
Maybe it's time to talk.	Wataƙila lokaci ya yi da za mu yi magana da juna.
I had a bad day.	Na yi mummunan rana.
That would be better.	Da hakan ya fi kyau.
Not sure, though.	Ban tabbata ba, ko da yake.

She went out and ran.	Ta fita da gudu.
We must hope.	Dole ne mu yi fata.
This makes us happy.	Wannan ya sa mu ji daɗi.
He should close the door.	Yakamata ya rufe kofar.
I may or may not agree.	Zan iya ko ba zan yarda ba.
Keep up the amazing work.	Ci gaba da aikin ban mamaki.
I know every answer except one.	Na san kowace amsa sai daya.
We are here for a while.	Muna nan na wani ɗan lokaci.
It felt like a second chance.	Ya ji kamar dama ta biyu.
It would no longer feel like I was doing anything right now.	Ba zai kara jin cewa ina yin wani abu ba yanzu.
I was in trouble.	Na kasance cikin matsala.
Something is happening.	Wani abu yana faruwa.
A smoker needs it from time to time.	Mai shan taba yana buƙatar shi lokaci zuwa lokaci.

It's about passion.	Yana da game da so.
It seems they are not here.	Kamar ba su nan.
So it should be.	Don haka ya kamata.
But now it is certain.	Amma yanzu ya tabbata.
If there is no health there is no benefit.	Idan babu lafiya babu wani amfani.
She came out.	Ta fito.
I'm not afraid things will not work out.	Ba na jin tsoro abubuwa ba za su yi aiki ba.
They looked at each other.	Suka kalli juna.
I got two though.	Na sami biyu ko da yake.
They grow slowly, but they mature at the same time.	Suna girma a hankali, amma suna cika lokaci guda.
But she forgot the name.	Amma ta manta sunan.
She will be scared, but she can do it.	Za ta ji tsoro, amma ta iya yin hakan.
I didn't get that.	Ban samu haka ba.
Others later died.	Wasu kuma daga baya sun mutu.
Do what you want from this.	Yi abin da kuke so daga wannan.
Hear it.	Jin shi.
I have nothing.	Ba ni da komai.
It comes slowly.	Ya zo a hankali.
During this time, the work changed.	A wannan lokacin, aikin ya canza.
The water began to rise.	Ruwa ya fara tashi.
Hopefully this will be accepted.	Da fatan za a yarda da hakan.
And sometimes most think.	Kuma wani lokacin mafi yawan tunanin.
It can be viewed by anyone.	Ana iya kallon kowa.
Women love this kind of stuff.	Mata suna son irin wannan kayan.
It's time.	Lokaci yayi.
We all asked each other, we agreed.	Mu duka muka tambayi juna, mun yarda.
It is not finished yet.	Har yanzu bai gama ba.
He and everyone else are crying.	Shi da kowa sai kuka suke.
Whenever it is said that it has been repaired.	Duk lokacin da aka ce an gyara shi.
I think the boy went to school, came back from school.	Ina ganin yaro ya tafi makaranta, ya dawo daga makaranta.
It’s good for me somehow.	Yana da kyau a gare ni ko ta yaya.
And it almost killed me.	Kuma ya kusan kashe ni.
Looking for someone to come.	Neman wani ya zo.
It will help me.	Zai taimake ni.
And he gave me that look.	Kuma ya ba ni wannan kallon.
As you said, he did not understand.	Kamar yadda ka ce, bai gane ba.
That will not do.	Wannan ba zai yi ba.
I took care of myself.	Na kula da kaina.
He is accustomed to this.	Ya saba da wannan.
Let's turn it on.	Mu kunna shi.
They do this job well.	Suna yin wannan aikin da kyau.
Maybe another time.	Wataƙila wani lokaci kuma.
I'll worry about it later, not now.	Zan damu da shi daga baya, ba yanzu ba.
We will not go back there.	Ba za mu koma can ba.
You have to keep going when you can.	Dole ne ku ci gaba lokacin da za ku iya.
The same thing is happening.	Haka kuma abin yake faruwa.
Victory came quickly.	Nasara ta zo da sauri.
No one did.	Babu wanda ya yi.
Just let it be as it is.	Kawai ku bar shi ya kasance kamar yadda yake.
The day did not start well.	Ranar ba ta fara kyau ba.
I do not know their names.	Ban san suna can ba.
This is also a lie.	Wannan kuma karya ce.
I have been here before.	Na kasance a nan kafin.
This is a difficult thing.	Wannan abu ne mai wuya.
For people, for me.	Ga mutane, a gare ni.
No, he thought.	A'a, ya yi tunani.
All he wants is to get back to you.	Duk abin da yake so shi ne ya dawo gare ku.
And in it, you know that.	Kuma a ciki, kun san hakan.
No need now.	Ba buƙatar yanzu.
She is tired of living a wonderful life.	Ta gaji da rayuwa mai ban sha'awa.
But it did not show.	Amma bai nuna ba.
I don’t care how you do it, which one you use.	Ban damu da yadda kuke yi ba, wanda kuke amfani da shi.
Then the world.	Sai kuma duniya.
Not necessary.	Ba dole ba.
And then it has to be true.	Bayan haka kuma dole ne ya zama gaskiya.
But no one said anything.	Amma babu wanda ya ce komai.
I am with you on that.	Ina tare da ku akan hakan.
He opened the door and entered.	Ya bude kofar ya shiga.
But it has always been the case.	Amma ya zama kamar haka a baya.
Why he did not, it is difficult to say.	Me ya sa bai yi ba, da wuya a ce.
I have many things for you today.	Ina da abubuwa da yawa a gare ku yau.
She has.	Tana da.
It will not rain today.	Ba za a yi ruwan sama a yau ba.
So he carefully removed the material.	Don haka ya cire kayan a hankali.
Leave everything.	Bar komai.
But she also knows mine.	Amma ita ma ta san nawa.
Or, no, that's not fair.	Ko, a'a, hakan bai dace ba.
No wording here.	Babu magana a nan.
People are walking.	Mutane suna tafiya.
Things are not real.	Abubuwa ba na gaske ba ne.
If that happens, we are done.	Idan haka ta faru, mun gama.
I do not refuse.	Ba na ƙi.
They are not afraid.	Ba sa tsoro.
Aure na.	Aure na .
How do you do that?	Yaya kuke yin wannan?
She left me several times.	Ta bar ni sau da yawa.
No next week.	Babu mako mai zuwa.
We are excited about our new program.	Mun yi farin ciki da sabon shirin mu.
I have never had a problem with it.	Ban taba samun matsala da shi ba.
I love him.	Ina son shi.
We want to know.	Muna so mu sani.
Play games.	Buga wasa.
He has advanced very well.	Ya yi gaba sosai.
She may try to eat more.	Tana iya ƙoƙarin cin ƙarin abubuwan.
Start with myself.	Fara da kaina.
It comes from.	Ya zo daga cikin.
It's really real.	Yana da gaske sosai.
We are going to get married.	Za mu yi aure.
Why would he.	Me yasa zai.
I still do.	Har yanzu ina haka.
It's not a story, it's a song.	Ba labarin ya yi ba, waƙa ce.
This is a man.	Wannan mutum ne.
It happens slowly.	Yana faruwa ne a hankali.
I do not want to see anything.	Ba na son ganin komai.
She is so beautiful.	Ta yi kyau sosai.
Or come and have a drink.	Ko kuma ku zo ku sha.
You are the person who has changed.	Kai mutumin da ya canza.
He can't remember how it was before.	Ba zai iya tuna yadda take a da ba.
Nothing really happened.	Babu wani abu da ya faru da gaske.
Maybe this will fix the problem.	Wataƙila wannan zai gyara matsalar.
So stop now.	Don haka a daina yanzu.
We love women and they can see that.	Muna son mata kuma suna iya ganin hakan.
And everyone is against us.	Kuma kowa yana gaba da mu.
Please be taken.	Da fatan za a ɗauka.
I was very happy with it.	Na yi matukar farin ciki da shi.
You should try it sometimes.	Ya kamata ku gwada shi wani lokaci.
He understands why they are here.	Ya fahimci dalilin da yasa suke zuwa nan.
Hopefully that will be killed.	Da fatan za a kashe hakan.
You will only get out of it what you put in it.	Za ku fita daga ciki kawai abin da kuka saka a ciki.
A little crazy.	Dan rashin hankali.
So no one can understand anything.	Don haka babu wanda ya gane zai iya gane komai.
And, of course, maybe the room is not for everyone.	Kuma, ba shakka, watakila dakin ba kowa ba ne.
What we can do now is wait.	Abin da za mu iya yi yanzu shi ne jira.
Just tell us when you want to travel.	Kawai gaya mana lokacin da kuke son tafiya.
Almost everyone, how.	Kusan kowa, ta yaya.
But he can't get that.	Amma ba zai iya samun wannan ba.
No one can hear us.	Ba wanda zai iya jin mu.
I will tell you so.	Zan gaya muku haka.
She is not afraid.	Bata jin tsoro.
She will be sought because she is wanted.	Za a nemi ta saboda ana son ta.
He confirmed.	Ya tabbatar.
Children do not want to do homework.	Yara ba sa son yin aikin gida.
I do not see anything you can say.	Ban ga wani abin da za ku iya cewa.
I do not know the rest.	Ban san sauran ba.
If you can try it, great.	Idan za ku iya gwada shi, mai girma.
And boy, let me get it.	Kuma yaro, ya bari na samu.
I think we have to do this together.	Ina ganin dole ne mu yi wannan tare.
Who won?	Wanene ya yi nasara?
It can be done together or not.	Ana iya yin hakan tare ko a'a.
He knew it was time, and the day was coming.	Ya san cewa lokaci ya yi, kuma ranar na zuwa.
No one knows but me.	Ba wanda ya sani sai ni.
She is there.	Tana can.
There is one thing.	Akwai abu daya.
They should not be telling you what to do.	Bai kamata su kasance suna gaya muku abin da za ku yi ba.
It is good to hear from you.	Yana da kyau a ji daga gare ku.
But that seems to be the case now.	Amma da alama hakan ya dace da shi a yanzu.
She ran and got on board.	Ta gudu ta kama jirgin.
I love them all !.	Ina son su duka!.
Little by little, anyway.	Kadan kadan, ko ta yaya.
It is a tool of development.	Kayan aikin ci gaba ne.
This is what she hopes will happen.	Abin da take fatan zai faru kenan.
She wanted to know how you were.	Ta so ta san yadda kuka kasance.
Not the other way around.	Ba wata hanya ba.
It's so good.	Yana da kyau haka.
It is raining.	An yi ruwan sama.
Do not write this opportunity off.	Kar a rubuta wannan damar a kashe.
They accuse him of not playing.	Suna zargin rashin wasa.
And really happy.	Kuma da gaske farin ciki.
Nice to see.	Yayi kyau gani.
Don't tell me.	Ba ku so ni.
Don't tell me.	Kar ku gaya mani.
He did not expect anything.	Bai yi fatan komai ba.
So, one thing and water.	Don haka, abu ɗaya da ruwa.
There is no way to say them.	Babu yadda za a ce su.
I left them all there.	Na bar su duka a wurin.
I'm fine with that.	Ina lafiya da wannan.
He can't tell you anything.	Ba zai iya gaya muku komai ba.
And nothing was said.	Kuma ba a ce komai ba.
I love it so much, it even makes me love everything.	Ina son shi haka, har ma ya sa ni son komai.
Anything useful is gone.	Duk wani abu na amfani ya tafi.
But nothing like what is happening now.	Amma babu kamar abin da ke faruwa a yanzu.
There is interest.	Akwai sha'awa.
She died for them.	Ta mutu gare su.
We will be getting married next year.	Za mu yi aure shekara mai zuwa.
The time I was going to go was pretty good.	Lokacin da zan tafi ya yi kyau sosai.
Or, they bought these things.	Ko kuma, sun sayi waɗannan abubuwan.
He did not know what to do with such a request.	Bai san me zai yi da bukata irin wannan ba.
Water covers the whole earth like rain.	Ruwa yana neman duk duniya kamar ruwan sama.
Not to be outdone by this game every day.	Ba don zama a yi magana game da wannan wasan kowace rana ba.
It is not difficult to leave the water.	Kada da wuya ya bar ruwan.
Not a good thing.	Ba abu mai kyau ba.
I thought.	Na yi tunani.
But women should wait.	Amma mata su jira.
She quickly closed the door.	Da sauri ta rufe kofar.
I never heard from him.	Ban taba ji daga gare shi ba.
Good job if you can get it.	Kyakkyawan aiki idan za ku iya samun shi.
But he did not feel comfortable.	Amma bai ji dadi ba.
And it's good.	Kuma yana da kyau.
I can’t imagine working here.	Ba zan iya tunanin ba aiki a nan.
And they won't make you sleep.	Kuma ba za su sa ka yi barci ba.
I want something to take care of.	Ina son abin da zan kula.
They get more sleep because they sleep during the day.	Sun kara samun barci saboda sun yi barci da rana.
This is both safe and necessary.	Wannan duka lafiya ne kuma aikin dole.
The truth is a lie.	Gaskiya karya ce.
.	.
There is something he hopes to see happen.	Akwai abin da yake fatan gani ya faru.
Call us.	Kira gare mu.
This boat is real.	Wannan jirgin ruwa na gaske ne.
It is indeed a great time.	Lallai lokaci ne mai girma.
She can't sell it.	Ba za ta iya sayar da shi ba.
It's very sad.	Yana da matukar bakin ciki.
Eventually it turned out that everything was up.	A ƙarshe ya fito cewa komai yana sama.
Although it is called, but it does not seem to work.	Ko da yake an kira shi, amma da alama ba ya aiki.
Not much, perhaps.	Ba yawa, watakila.
He was, however, interested in showing consent.	Ya kasance, duk da haka, yana sha'awar nuna yarda.
We are not going to do anything like that.	Ba za mu yi wani abu irin wannan ba.
It tells you how long you have been talking.	Yana gaya muku tsawon lokacin da kuka yi magana.
There will be no exit time.	Ba za a sami lokacin fita ba.
It's hard to explain, but trust me, it's hard.	Yana da wuya a bayyana, amma ku yarda da ni, yana da wuya.
Tell him what you told me!	Faɗa masa abin da ka gaya mani!
Like they were.	Kamar sun kasance.
I don’t know what to do from there.	Ban san abin da zan yi daga nan ba.
But this is not a school.	Amma wannan ba makaranta ba ce.
After describing the events, the man was killed.	Bayan ya bayyana abubuwan da ya faru, an kashe mutumin.
I have a job cut out for me.	Ina da aikin da aka yanke mini.
No, they did not.	A'a, ba su yi ba.
They are useless to him.	Ba su da amfani a gare shi.
We have been identified.	An gano mu.
You tell him that you love him.	Za ka gaya masa cewa kana son shi.
One way is if you do it in your own home.	Hanya guda ita ce idan kun yi shi a cikin gidan ku.
But not much before they get here.	Amma ba da yawa kafin su isa nan.
I had this problem once.	Na sami wannan matsalar sau ɗaya.
Just like never before.	Kamar a taba.
Children do not go to school.	Yara ba sa zuwa makaranta.
He too.	Shi ma shi kadai.
I do not have to read.	Ba sai na karanta ba.
He may or may not be married.	Zai iya yin aure ko ba zai yi aure ba.
Let me suggest you take one.	Bari in ba da shawarar ku ɗauki ɗaya.
It's all true.	Duk gaskiya ne.
This is everything.	Wannan shi ne komai.
The water continued to rise.	Ruwa ya ci gaba da tashi.
I hope you understand, what I want.	Ina fatan kun gane, abin da nake so.
Yes to me.	Haka ne a gare ni.
I would kill myself otherwise.	Zan kashe kaina in ba haka ba.
Always be on time.	Koyaushe ku kasance akan lokaci.
I caught that.	Na kama haka.
Sleeping at home can be very difficult.	Barci a cikin gida na iya zama da wahala sosai.
He is a hard worker.	Mutum ne mai aiki.
And many did.	Kuma mutane da yawa sun yi.
Maybe then.	Wataƙila a lokacin ne.
Everyone uses it.	Kowa yana amfani da ita.
But that has changed in recent years.	Amma da hakan ya canza cikin ƴan shekaru.
I need you a lot.	Ina bukatar ku da yawa.
But he paid her more than she was.	Amma ya biya ta fiye da yadda ta ke.
It's coming to an end.	Yana zuwa ƙarshe.
She prefers, more than that.	Ta fi so, fiye da haka.
They are four.	Ba ni bane.
All we can know is the world.	Duk abin da za mu iya sani shine duniya.
I can hope !.	Zan iya fatan!.
Here they did not.	A nan ba su yi ba.
Yaro, ya yaro.	Yaro, ya yaro.
We filled in early.	Mun cika tun farko.
He does not like driving.	Ba ya son tuƙi.
He is in trouble.	Yana cikin matsala.
Almost surprisingly.	Kusan abin mamaki haka.
And you can still have fun.	Kuma har yanzu kuna iya jin daɗi.
A few years.	Shekaru kadan.
And now they are gone.	Yanzu kuma sun tafi.
It feels good today.	Ya ji dadi a yau.
He never 'failed' me.	Bai taba 'kasa' ni ba.
That we have already answered.	Wannan mun riga mun amsa.
That's the way it is.	Haka abin yake.
I am not saying that.	Ba haka nake cewa ba.
Don't ask me.	Kar ka tambaye ni.
I do not have to wait for it.	Ba sai na jira shi ba.
Maybe one day this weekend.	Wataƙila wata rana wannan karshen mako.
Surprising but here we are.	Abin mamaki amma ga mu nan.
I said sure.	Na ce tabbas.
You should do this every day.	Ya kamata ku yi hakan kowace rana.
If you do not care, we will not care.	Idan ba ku damu ba, mu ma ba za mu damu ba.
It could not be a better place.	Ba zai iya zama wuri mafi kyau ba.
Some are scared, and everything, but they are still there.	Wasu suna jin tsoro, da komai, amma har yanzu suna nan.
Let him do what he wants.	Bari ya yi abin da yake so.
You just have to let the person talk.	Dole ne kawai ku bar mutumin yayi magana.
This may cover it.	Wannan na iya rufe shi.
He was another.	Ya kasance wani.
They can just be.	Suna iya zama kawai.
That is not what caused me.	Ba shi ne ya sa ni ba.
When and where to eat.	Lokacin da kuma inda za su ci abinci.
We not only love each other, but we love each other.	Mu ba kawai son juna ba, amma muna son juna.
There they sat down and proceeded.	Nan suka zauna suka ci gaba.
And still nothing.	Kuma har yanzu ba komai.
However, police allege negligence.	Duk da haka, 'yan sanda suna zargin rashin wasa.
Feeling nothing, and not doing anything.	Jin komai, da rashin yin komai.
Lots of things, lots of them.	Abubuwa da yawa, da yawa.
I do not know what to expect.	Ban san abin da zan jira ba.
He walks fast.	Yana tafiya da sauri.
One of many.	Daya daga cikin da yawa.
It certainly is not for me.	Yana da tabbas ba a gare ni ba.
We are not going to get involved in that.	Ba za mu shiga cikin hakan ba.
But he spoke up.	Amma ya yi magana.
And, that's fine.	Kuma, hakan yayi kyau.
How did he do it?	Yaya ya yi?
However, I think this is a very useful thing.	Duk da haka, ina ganin wannan wani abu ne mai matukar amfani.
The process of development is not easy to identify.	Hanyar ci gaba ba ta da sauƙi a gano.
He thought of the story he had read.	Ya yi tunanin labarin da ya karanta.
It is good that you are close to it until the end.	Yana da kyau ku kasance kusa da shi har zuwa ƙarshe.
She is so weak!	Tana da rauni sosai!
Take care of yourself, eat and sleep just the night before.	Kula da kanku, ci da barci daidai daren da ya gabata.
It stands still well.	Ya tsaya a nan sosai.
Finally, it was time to return home.	A ƙarshe, lokaci ya yi da za a dawo gida.
No, too slowly.	A'a, ma hankali.
This is a surprise	Wannan abin mamaki ne
We are sold.	An sayar da mu.
Very little has been done.	Kadan ne aka yi.
I think that was interesting.	Ina tsammanin cewa ya zama sha'awa.
You can not come.	Ba za ku iya zuwa ba.
Yesterday he was not there.	Jiya ba ya nan.
Must read.	Dole ne ya karanta.
Maybe that's fine.	Wataƙila hakan yana da kyau.
They are hard, but there are.	Suna da wuya, amma akwai.
You can not reach him.	Ba za ku iya zuwa gare shi ba.
I still do not understand why.	Har yanzu ban fahimci dalilin ba.
She reached over and turned it on.	Ta kai hannu ta kunna.
I know this is amazing.	Na san wannan yana da ban mamaki.
Do not be afraid.	Kar a ji tsoro.
He had never seen her so well.	Bai tab'a ganin ta da kyau ba.
Without it, thought would never be true.	Idan ba tare da shi ba, tunani ba zai taba zama gaskiya ba.
You certainly cannot imagine this moment until you are there.	Lallai ba za ku iya tunanin wannan lokacin ba sai kun kasance a wurin.
And it works.	Kuma yana aiki.
Nothing fancy, though.	Babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa, ko da yake.
And it doesn't end there.	Kuma bai kare a nan ba.
Maybe it was real.	Wataƙila ya kasance na gaske.
I do not know why this is happening.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa hakan ke faruwa ba.
Everything is there.	Duk abin da akwai.
Maybe she ran away from the police.	Watakila ta gudu daga 'yan sanda.
They can not be greater.	Ba za su iya zama mafi girma ba.
I know her well.	Na san ta sosai.
There is no time lost.	Babu lokacin rasa.
It's just fun to say.	Abin farin ciki ne kawai a ce.
This is open.	Wannan a bude yake.
Not as it should be.	Ba kamar yadda ya kamata ba.
I want to be like her.	Ina so in zama kamar ita.
Not a single player was arrested.	Babu dan wasa daya kama shi.
It rained all night.	An yi ruwan sama har dare.
It's been a year.	Ya yi shekara guda.
So we both went there at night.	Don haka mu biyu muka je can da dare.
I'll wait and see what happens.	Zan jira in ga abin da zai faru.
But nothing he did.	Amma ba abin da ya yi.
Come on.	Ku zo.
He got into trouble.	Ya samu matsala.
What will you see there? 	Me za ku gani a can?
We used to try two things.	Mun kasance muna gwada abubuwa guda biyu.
He fell to his knees.	Ya yi kasa a gwiwa.
When it started to rain, we waited.	Idan ruwan sama ya fara yi, sai mun jira.
That doesn't matter.	Hakan ba komai.
I can run	Zan iya gudu
Children are no longer allowed to play here.	An daina barin yara su yi wasa a nan.
I have to break it.	Dole ne in karya shi.
There will never be a better time.	Ba za a taɓa samun lokaci mafi kyau ba.
It makes everything easier.	Yana sa komai sauƙi.
She seems to have looked at him intently.	Da alama ta duba shi sosai.
But you do.	Amma kuna yi.
See how it is.	Ka ga yadda abin yake.
That's who we want to be.	Wanda muke son zama kenan.
I will definitely pass.	Da tabbas zan wuce.
The dinner was very nice.	Abincin dare yayi kyau sosai.
You must try.	Dole ne ku gwada.
I am interested in two things.	Ina sha'awar abubuwa biyu.
Look, there!	Duba, can!
Neither did they.	Su ma ba su yi ba.
Save it, save it.	Ajiye shi, ajiye shi.
How new!	Yaya sabon abu!
But not this event.	Amma ba wannan taron ba.
Time of work.	Lokaci na aiki.
She stood right.	Ta tsaya dama.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
The cause was immediately identified.	Nan da nan aka gano dalilin.
Keep up the good work.	Ku ci gaba da aikin.
I fell asleep.	Na yi barci.
I hope they don’t.	Ina fata ba za su yi ba.
I don't care about anything.	Ban damu da komai ba.
This restaurant offers good food.	Wannan gidan cin abinci yana ba da abinci mai kyau.
We want to be in that.	Muna so mu kasance cikin wannan.
This continued for a year.	Wannan ya ci gaba har tsawon shekara guda.
For one day.	Na rana guda.
I came up with the article.	Na zo da labarin.
I like this	Ina son wannan
I tell him so.	Ina gaya masa haka.
This is inappropriate and inappropriate.	Wannan bai dace ba kuma bai dace ba.
That's what we did.	Wannan mun yi.
It seems real.	Kamar gaske ne.
We were only together at the time, you see.	Mun kasance da juna kawai a lokacin, ka gani.
That should be the way life is now.	Yanzu haka ya kamata rayuwa ta kasance.
She must, because it looks so good.	Dole ne ta, saboda ya yi kyau sosai.
They are all very tired.	Duk sun gaji sosai.
There is even more.	Akwai ma fiye da haka.
If she says no, then it might be best to get something done.	Idan ta ce komai, gara ka sami abin yi.
I was surprised to see you here.	Na yi mamakin ganin ku a nan.
He didn’t care one way or another.	Bai damu da wata hanya ko wata ba.
It's been years.	An yi shekaru.
He is a real person.	Mutumin da gaske yake.
The dog problem too.	Matsalar kare kuma.
You are good to me, you know.	Kuna da kyau a gare ni, ka sani.
Save it for future reference.	Ajiye shi don tunani na gaba.
The fear will rise without me.	Tsoron za su tashi ba tare da ni ba.
He got it.	Ya samu.
Imagine that for a month, a year.	Ka yi tunanin cewa har wata ɗaya, shekara ɗaya.
I should stay safe if something happens.	Ya kamata in zauna lafiya idan wani abu ya faru.
We are all safe.	Mu duka muna lafiya.
Enough now and she knows.	Ya isa yanzu kuma ta sani.
I can not explain why.	Ba zan iya bayyana dalilin ba.
I was called.	Aka kira ni.
After a night's work, they are tired.	Bayan sun yi aikin dare, sun gaji.
They all know what needs to be done.	Duk sun san abin da ake bukata a yi.
They travel by bus.	Suna tafiya ta bas.
I have seen her in the past.	Ina ganin ta a baya.
Our food was delicious.	Abincin mu yayi dadi.
But he can not.	Amma ba zai iya ba.
I don't know what to do with her now.	Ban san me zan yi da ita ba yanzu.
Things that you do not think about happen to you.	Abubuwan da ba ku tunani game da su ne ke samun ku.
That never happened.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
The story just sees.	Labarin kawai yake gani.
I did it that night.	Na yi shi a wannan daren.
We hope you try it out.	Muna fatan ku gwada shi.
No one ever told me.	Babu wanda ya taba gaya mani.
So keep going.	Don haka sai a ci gaba da tafiya.
He wanted to cry but could not.	Ya so yayi kuka amma ya kasa.
Maybe I will die in a week.	Wataƙila zan mutu a cikin mako guda.
He never had a chance.	Bai taba samun damar ba.
I didn't eat my lunch.	Ban ci abincin rana na ba.
I have discovered many interesting things.	Na gano abubuwa masu ban sha'awa da yawa.
After all, you are one.	Bayan haka, kai ɗaya ne.
We want them to love us.	Muna son su so mu.
How much can he fill it with.	Nawa zai iya cika shi da shi.
Nothing is right, nothing is as it appears.	Babu abin da ke daidai, babu abin da yake kamar yadda ya bayyana.
So you can use it easily.	Don haka kuna iya amfani da shi cikin sauƙi.
We will check with him when we can.	Za mu duba tare da shi lokacin da za mu iya.
So nothing came of it.	Don haka babu abin da ya zo.
Just leave it as it is.	Kawai bar shi yadda yake.
All the work I did in the end paid off.	Duk aikin da nake yi a ƙarshe ya biya.
One needs money to travel.	Mutum yana buƙatar kuɗi don tafiya.
He was not planning to get married.	Bai shirya aure ba.
I do not think so.	Ba na tsammanin hakan ba.
I live here.	Ina zaune a nan.
Forget what they tell you at school.	Ka manta da abin da suke gaya maka a makaranta.
It has not been used since.	Tun daga lokacin ba a yi amfani da shi ba.
I am against myself.	Ina gaba da kaina.
It all didn't work for me.	Duka bai yi min aiki ba.
I am the one you should be with.	Ni ne ya kamata ku kasance tare da.
He drinks a lot.	Yana sha da yawa.
Close by, you are a little familiar.	Kusa kusa, kun ɗan saba.
I would recommend this.	Zan ba da shawarar wannan.
She loves them very much.	Ta so su sosai.
What he does.	Abin da yake yi.
No one will ever know.	Babu wanda zai taɓa sani.
He can sell it to anyone he wants.	Zai iya sayar wa wanda yake so.
Immediately she wanted not to.	Nan take ta so ba ta yi ba.
The man assured me of that.	Mutumin ya tabbatar min da hakan.
I do not know what happened.	Ban san abin da ya faru ba.
No one played or worked outside.	Babu wanda ya yi wasa ko aiki a waje.
You know about it, even though you don't think you do.	Kun san game da shi, ko da yake ba ku tunanin kuna yi.
You are more than a player.	Kun fi dan wasa.
He will have something to do.	Zai sami abin yi.
And what it is.	Kuma abin da shi ne.
It was very bad.	An yi rashin kyau sosai.
Why?	Me ya sa?
No one needs such money.	Babu wanda ke buƙatar kuɗi irin wannan.
She did not know what to say.	Bata san me zata ce ba.
See, they say.	Duba, suna cewa.
We know this for sure.	Mun san hakan tabbas.
I want to find out what happened in the article.	Ina so in gano abin da ya faru a cikin labarin.
And there is no way out.	Kuma babu wata hanyar fita daga gare ta.
Why would you think of something else.	Me yasa za ku yi tunanin wani abu kuma.
Unlike me.	Ba kamar ni ba.
I'd like to see a correction.	Ina son ganin an gyara.
Lots of money.	Kuɗi masu yawa.
But things are not easy.	Amma abubuwa ba su da sauƙi.
There it is.	Akwai shi.
I will see him arrive home safely.	Zan ga ya isa gida lafiya.
If not here's a new product just for you!	Idan ba shi ba, da wani ne.
Some have it all.	Wasu suna da duka.
Sorry, please.	Yi hakuri, don Allah.
Help will not come in time, anyway.	Taimako ba zai zo cikin lokaci ba, ta yaya.
You think you suffered.	Kuna tsammanin kun sha wahala.
There should be no school today.	Kada a kasance wata makaranta a yau.
Pay the bill.	Biya kuɗin.
I do not want to live without it.	Ba na son rayuwa ba tare da shi ba.
He was for the greatest.	Ya kasance don mafi girma.
This can be really hot.	Wannan na iya zama ainihin zafi.
She only wants food.	Abinci kawai take so.
Think carefully about what you are going to do.	Yi tunani a hankali game da abin da za ku yi.
It’s totally funny so don’t get me wrong.	Yana da ban dariya gaba ɗaya kar a yi min kuskure.
I think people don’t spend money.	Ina tsammanin mutane ba sa kashe kuɗi.
Waiting for the next thought.	Jiran tunani na gaba.
I still haven't slept.	Har yanzu ban yi barci ba.
But that is not the case.	Amma hakan bai kasance ba.
Sometimes they do.	Wani lokaci sai su yi.
Not more than that.	Ba fiye da haka ba.
The one who misled him.	Wanda ya bata masa.
We need to act fast.	Muna bukatar mu yi aiki da sauri.
All very well.	Duk yayi kyau sosai.
He grew up there, without knowing anything.	Ya girma a haka, ba tare da sanin wani abu ba.
So everything was.	Don haka komai ya kasance.
There is nothing like seeing people.	Babu wani abu kamar yadda ake gani mutane.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
No one came near.	Ba wanda ya zo kusa.
No one will pass that way.	Babu wanda zai wuce ta wannan hanya.
I looked inside.	Na duba daga ciki.
But it almost didn’t do well.	Amma bai kusan yi kyau ba.
If you remember this.	Idan kun tuna wannan.
You have to take care of them and take care of them.	Dole ne ku kula da su kuma ku kula da su.
Do your homework before eating, or you will be in trouble!	Yi aikin gida kafin cin abinci, ko za ku kasance cikin matsala!
If she fails.	Idan ta kasa.
Next time, maybe.	Lokaci na gaba, watakila.
This may be the last water that will be.	Wannan yana iya zama ruwa na ƙarshe da zai kasance.
He also did not say who he was.	Haka kuma bai bayyana ko wanene shi ba.
Please check it now to start earning money.	Da fatan za a duba shi yanzu don fara samun kuɗi.
He reached thirty.	Ya kai talatin.
I know what you think.	Na san abin da kuke tunani.
He drank before answering.	Ya sha kafin ya amsa.
Of course it looks like it could be real.	Tabbas yayi kama da yana iya zama na gaske.
Too much for some.	Ya yi yawa ga wasu.
They were so delicious.	Sun kasance masu dadi sosai.
She told us.	Ta gaya mana.
Almost everyone.	Kusan kowa ne.
But not as you think.	Amma ba kamar yadda kuke tunani ba.
They should know what is going on.	Ya kamata su san abin da ke faruwa.
Or make dinner.	Ko yin abincin dare.
He had to defend himself.	Dole ne ya kare kansa.
We know it will not be easy.	Mun san ba zai kasance da sauƙi ba.
She would not leave him.	Ba za ta bar shi ba.
There is nothing in the world.	Babu komai a duniya.
He was just trying to help.	Yana ƙoƙari kawai ya taimaka.
We don't even know them.	Ba mu ma san su ba.
Which later moved on.	Abin da daga baya ya koma.
We give them a second chance !.	Mu ba su dama ta biyu!.
It was an amazing feeling.	Wani ji ne mai ban mamaki.
There is so much to see in the world.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a gani a duniya.
More than three.	Fiye kamar uku.
And now he is here.	Kuma yanzu yana nan.
In fact, he feels nothing.	A gaskiya, ba ya jin komai.
So they agreed.	Don haka suka yarda.
For me, eating out is a big deal.	A gare ni, cin abinci a waje babban abu ne.
Now he is back.	Yanzu ya dawo.
Much can be done.	Da yawa za a iya yi.
And not from the cold.	Kuma ba daga sanyi ba.
I feel so good.	Na ji dadi sosai.
And honestly there is nothing you can do about it.	Kuma gaskiya babu abin da za ku iya yi game da hakan.
No use.	Babu amfani.
We do not even know what happened to you.	Ba ma za mu san abin da ya faru da ku ba.
No one went there.	Babu wanda ya je wurin.
A few are known.	An san wasu kaɗan.
Laughter filled the house.	Dariya ta cika gidan.
And now we both have more than that.	Kuma yanzu mu biyu muna da fiye da haka.
And we have a job.	Kuma muna da aikin yi.
I tried to get it done.	Na yi ƙoƙarin samun yadda aka yi.
She did everything you asked her to do.	Ta yi komai da duk abin da ka tambaye ta.
Exactly the other way around.	Daidai ga sauran hanyar.
Don't make me.	Kar ku sa ni.
I was outside.	Na yi waje.
That is the problem.	Wannan ita ce matsalar.
Other than that, this is a difficult time.	Ban da wannan, wannan lokaci ne mai wahala.
It is God.	Allah ne.
That would be a problem.	Wannan zai zama matsala.
No more there.	Babu kuma a can.
She wants them to accept this.	Tana so su yarda da wannan.
It's a job.	Wani aiki ne.
It does not hurt.	Ba ya jin zafi.
But don't worry about it.	Amma kar ka damu da shi.
All they can do is wait for us.	Abin da za su iya yi, kawai, shine jira mu.
I would have said no.	Da na ce masa a'a.
Maybe they can help.	Wataƙila za su iya taimaka.
You can check them out.	Kuna iya duba su.
I will stay safe.	Zan zauna lafiya.
We almost missed this.	Mun kusan rasa wannan.
Just log in.	Kawai shiga ciki.
She will catch him.	Za ta kama shi.
It won’t be too much now.	Ba zai yi yawa ba yanzu.
No one recognized him.	Babu wanda ya gane shi.
I know him.	Ina san shi.
I can't be more interesting.	Ba zan iya zama mai ban sha'awa ba.
Can't find anyone.	Ba za a iya samun wani.
One such.	Daya daga cikin irin wannan.
But still she knew that she would keep it at home.	Amma duk da haka ta san cewa za ta ajiye a gida.
She raised her hand to him.	Ta daga masa hannu.
I remember feeling very happy.	Na tuna ina jin farin ciki sosai.
Show the world that you can.	Nuna wa duniya cewa za ku iya.
He does not have much money.	Ba shi da kuɗi da yawa.
I want to know about the place.	Ina so in sani game da wurin.
They just said he brought it.	Sai kawai suka ce ya kawo.
Now she knows how much she loves him.	Yanzu ta san irin son da take masa.
If you need more time, take it.	Idan kuna buƙatar ƙarin lokaci, ɗauka.
I have to work.	Dole ne in yi aiki.
I think she was very happy.	Ina tsammanin ta yi farin ciki sosai.
There is another place.	Akwai wurin kuma.
I know nothing about the moment.	Ban san komai ba game da lokacin.
The children are playing.	Yara suna wasa.
I think after this weekend though it finally has.	Ina tsammanin bayan wannan karshen mako ko da yake a ƙarshe yana da.
I show him my school.	Ina nuna masa makaranta ta.
I'm trying to find a job.	Ina ƙoƙarin neman wani aiki.
This is not for us.	Wannan ba mu bane.
No night.	Babu dare.
It is like the work of life.	Yana kama da aikin rayuwa.
You do not even know it.	Kai ma ba ka san shi ba.
You have what you want.	Kuna da abin da kuke so.
Please excuse me.	Da fatan za a ba ni hakuri.
I would say we will be finished.	Zan ce za a gama da mu.
It did me really good.	Ya yi min kyau sosai.
And he knows it's true.	Kuma ya san gaskiya ne.
Kids have it done.	Yaro suna da shi ya yi.
He will die slowly.	Zai mutu a hankali.
She lost her temper.	Ta bata hakuri.
I will never be that way again.	Ba zan sake zama ta hakan ba.
Hear it, hear what you do.	Ji shi, ji abin da kuke yi.
Today we left three.	Yau mun bar uku.
I will still.	Har yanzu zan.
And he did not cover it.	Kuma bai rufe shi ba.
I am ready, he said.	Na shirya, yace.
So tell the whole story.	Don haka ba da labarin duka.
Accept it.	Yarda da shi.
She was just.	Ta kasance kawai.
I will not walk with him.	Ba zan yi tafiya da shi ba.
Nothing happens in the moment you want it.	Babu wani abu da zai faru a cikin lokacin da kuke so.
It's amazing.	Abin ban mamaki ne.
I hope you can.	Ina fatan za ku iya.
Why is this happening?	Me yasa hakan ke faruwa.
Not talking to her, exactly.	Ba magana da ita, daidai.
I think he’s the guy everyone looks at.	Ina tsammanin shine mutumin da kowa ya duba.
You should do something.	Ya kamata ku yi wani abu.
I want to come next time.	Ina so in zo lokaci na gaba.
There is no progress for children now.	Babu ci gaba ga yara yanzu.
However, it is a good life.	Duk da haka, rayuwa ce mai kyau.
Not even close.	Ba ma kusa ba.
The third was the same.	Haka na uku ya kasance.
So she could walk.	Don haka ta iya tafiya.
If you have ever had the opportunity to do so you should.	Idan kun taba samun damar yin haka ya kamata ku.
Done.	An samu.
That must change.	Dole ne hakan ya canza.
He is trying to do the right thing.	Yana ƙoƙarin yin abin da ya dace.
He seems to be really worried.	Da alama ya damu da gaske.
That hasn't really changed.	Wannan bai canza da gaske ba.
Absolutely.	Babu shakka.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
You have to find out for yourself.	Dole ne ku gano da kanku.
You should know more than that.	Yakamata ku sani fiye da haka.
He knows everything at once.	Ya san komai lokaci guda.
He told anyone who would feel that he would not return.	Ya gaya wa duk wanda zai ji cewa ba zai koma ba.
I think you will love it.	Ina tsammanin za ku so shi.
My son again.	Dan na sake.
Either way, you know me.	Ko ta yaya, ka san ni.
And she is with me.	Kuma tana tare da ni.
Keep talking to him.	Ci gaba da magana da shi.
He did not come home.	Bai zo gida ba.
I started crying.	Na fara kuka.
We enjoyed doing it.	Mun ji daɗin yin sa.
But in reality he is a role model.	Amma a gaskiya shi abin koyi ne.
Weep slowly.	Kuka take a hankali.
I'm just getting into the book.	Ina kawai shiga cikin littafin.
It was always hot.	Kullum ta kasance mai zafi.
Today is a hot day.	Yau rana ce mai zafi.
I just want it to happen.	Ina so kawai ya faru.
She was right waiting for the school bus.	Ta yi daidai ta jira motar makaranta.
Of the workers.	Na masu aiki.
He will be my role model.	Zai zama abin koyi na.
They did not ask him what was past or his own.	Ba su tambaye shi abin da ya gabata ko na kansa ba.
I will not try to make anything happen.	Ba zan yi ƙoƙarin sa wani abu ya faru ba.
Not surprisingly.	Ba abin mamaki ba ne.
He was tired and sad.	Ya gaji da bakin ciki.
The room changed.	Dakin ya canza.
How things did not work out.	Yadda abin bai yi ba.
If you work, you can find the right place.	Idan kun yi aiki, za ku iya samun wurin da ya dace.
Why, he does not know.	Don me, bai sani ba.
We would have taken her.	Da mun tafi da ita.
He said.	Yace.
I have never met a living being.	Ban hadu da rai mai rai ba.
The flight was good, of course.	Jirgin ya yi kyau, ba shakka.
And it may not be a way for you.	Kuma ba zai iya zama wata hanya a gare ku ba.
I totally agree with you.	Na yarda da ku gaba ɗaya.
Obviously a lot of things I wear are bad.	Babu shakka abubuwa da yawa na sa ba su da kyau.
And many are bigger than they are.	Kuma da yawa sun fi su girma.
Everything will happen.	Da gaske ne komai zai faru.
And very interesting.	Kuma abin sha'awa sosai.
Watch them do it.	Kallon su yayi.
To this day, nothing has changed.	Har yau, babu abin da ya canza.
Thinking can help.	Yin tunani zai iya taimaka.
Time and things have changed.	Lokaci da abubuwa sun canza.
They ask why we hate them.	Suka tambayi dalilin da ya sa muke ƙi su.
It is very difficult to make money.	Yana da matukar wahala a sami kuɗi.
I will never lose sight of the fact that I am not safe.	Ba zan taɓa rasa tsoron cewa ba lafiya.
Not this !.	Ba wannan ba!.
I think this could be the problem.	Ina tsammanin wannan yana iya zama matsalar.
Now the problem.	Yanzu matsalar.
But not like you.	Amma ba kamar ku ba.
You are right in all your decisions.	Kun yi daidai a duk shawarar ku.
Nothing happened.	Babu wani abu da ya faru.
It may be the only opportunity you get at this.	Yana iya zama kawai damar da za ku samu a wannan.
Many say it is the best.	Mutane da yawa sun ce shi ne mafi kyau.
He has done this before.	Ya yi wannan a baya.
I said that.	Na ce haka.
He was upset to know that these things had happened.	Ya damu da ya san cewa waɗannan abubuwan sun faru.
Now go ahead.	Yanzu ku ci gaba.
How about it ?.	Yaya game da shi?.
That would be fine.	Hakan zai yi daidai.
You will bring back a new person.	Za ku dawo sabon mutum.
To the back door.	Zuwa kofar dakin baya.
Should get one.	Kamata yayi ya samu daya.
Your help comes exactly when we need it.	Taimakon ku ya zo daidai lokacin da muke bukata.
I talked to him.	Na yi magana da shi.
He may have died immediately.	Wataƙila ya mutu nan da nan.
After that, go back.	Bayan haka, koma baya.
The plane took off.	Jirgin ya tashi.
Is that correct?	Shin hakan yayi daidai?
How long it took there, he does not know.	Har yaushe aka yi a can, bai sani ba.
The thought was funny.	Tunanin ya kasance mai ban dariya.
After that it worked.	Bayan haka ya yi aiki.
He no longer thought of that.	Bai kara tunanin hakan ba.
If he feels he is at home he does not show up.	Idan ya ji yana gida bai nuna ba.
The car is very comfortable.	Motar tana da daɗi sosai.
They started slowly and took to running.	Suka fara a hankali suka ɗauki gudu.
I talked to other people, but a little bit.	Na yi magana da sauran mutane, amma kadan kadan.
I need to buy more tools.	Ina bukata in saya ƙarin kayan aikin.
Everyone wants to help.	Kowa yana so ya taimake shi.
Watch this program !.	Ku kalli wannan shirin!.
I do not know how to do it.	Ban san yadda zan yi ba.
Must be someone else.	Dole ne ya zama wani.
This requires two things.	Wannan yana bukatar abubuwa biyu.
She wanted it first.	Ta so da farko.
She could not see anything from there.	Ta kasa ganin komai daga nan.
People here regularly do amazing things.	Mutane a nan a kai a kai suna yin abubuwan ban mamaki.
Of course it will.	Tabbas zai yi.
Better prepared.	Gara ya shirya.
Whatever you call him, do not tell him.	Duk abin da kuka kira shi, kada ku fada masa.
I slept a little.	Na dan yi barci kadan.
Stir quickly and turn off the heat.	Dama da sauri kuma kashe zafi.
Nothing was done about it.	Ba wani abu aka yi game da shi.
It is very useful so.	Yana da matukar amfani haka.
Come now.	Zo yanzu.
I completely lost !.	Na rasa gaba daya!.
To speak, or feel a certain way.	Don yin magana, ko jin wata hanya.
It's a little bit.	Yana da kadan.
Never in trouble.	Kada a cikin matsala.
So he really enjoyed it.	Don haka ya ji daɗi sosai.
I will say that again.	Zan sake cewa.
Duration.	Tsawon lokaci.
So sorry.	Don haka hakuri.
It has been going on since that day.	Haka ya faru tun daga ranar.
But it worked for me.	Amma ya yi min aiki.
Otherwise, they will not pass.	Idan kuma ba haka ba, ba za su wuce ba.
You look tired.	Ka ga an gaji.
He went.	Ya tafi.
The meeting is not the same.	Taron bai daya.
It’s a very appropriate thing.	Abu ne da ya dace sosai.
That run was good, though.	Wannan gudu ya yi kyau, ko da yake.
He is sick today.	Ba shi da lafiya yau.
And it will not take much time.	Kuma ba zai ɗauki lokaci mai yawa ba.
Not a good sight.	Ba kyakkyawan gani ba.
Or you can just show them.	Ko kuma kuna iya nuna su kawai.
To see the truth can be scary.	Don ganin gaskiya na iya zama abin ban tsoro.
Now they have it.	Yanzu suna da shi.
You will still kill me.	Har yanzu za ku kashe ni.
This did not end well.	Wannan bai kare da kyau ba.
I returned home and went to study.	Na dawo gida na tafi karatu.
And all these things happened on time.	Kuma duk waɗannan abubuwa sun faru a kan lokaci.
What time is it?	Wani lokaci ne?
I make her one, she makes me one.	Ina mai da ita daya, ta sanya ni daya.
You expect more of it.	Kuna tsammanin ƙarin shi.
Let's do it right away.	Bari mu yi shi nan da nan.
And they were not of the runners.	Kuma ba su kasance daga cikin gudu ba.
This would be a mistake.	Wannan zai zama kuskure.
I'm here as well.	Ina nan kamar yadda.
All of the above.	Duk na sama.
You just have to know how to tell him what to do.	Dole ne kawai ku san yadda za ku gaya masa abin da za ku yi.
She went and ran.	Ta tafi da gudu.
And it is wrong.	Kuma ba daidai ba ne.
Hurry up or we will miss the bus!	Yi sauri ko mu rasa bas!
I will continue to study, no matter what.	Zan ci gaba da karatu, koma menene.
I'm not sure how you do it.	Ban tabbata yadda kuke yi ba.
It is, however, the future.	Shi ne, duk da haka, nan gaba.
Do not accept that.	Kar ku yarda da hakan.
I'm not sure about you.	Ban tabbata ba game da ku.
He did what he did.	Ya yi abin da ya yi.
I was scared about that.	Na ji tsoro game da wannan.
You can of course use '' to remove them.	Kuna iya ba shakka amfani da '' don cire su.
And he did not know.	Kuma bai sani ba.
She told me so.	Ta gaya min haka.
You have your own.	Kuna da kanku.
He does not have a suitable home to live in.	Ba shi da gidan da ya dace ya zauna.
I enjoyed the place all the time.	Na ji daɗin wurin kowane lokaci.
It's bigger this year.	Ya fi girma a wannan shekara.
It's good.	Yana da kyau.
The work was good.	Aikin ya yi kyau.
Or he uses the wrong person to do it.	Ko yana amfani da mutumin da bai dace ba don yin shi.
I am pregnant here and there.	Ina ciki nan da can.
So, there is no help there.	Don haka, babu taimako a can.
So do many others in the world.	Haka ma wasu da yawa a duniya.
I could not read it quickly.	Na kasa karanta shi da sauri.
I still feel great from work.	Har yanzu ina jin girma daga aiki.
We will hit you here.	Za mu buga ku a nan.
Nor should anyone.	Haka kuma bai kamata kowa ba.
Everyone knows it.	Kowa ya san shi.
You show, it shows.	Ka nuna, ya nuna.
It is a very cold time.	Lokaci ne mai sanyi sosai.
Even after all this rain.	Ko bayan duk wannan ruwan sama.
I know this is true.	Na san wannan gaskiya ce.
It hurts a lot.	Ya ji zafi sosai.
It is true for.	Gaskiya ne ga.
It's too much.	Ya yi yawa.
We have seen this before.	Mun ga wannan a baya.
Let's move on.	Mu ci gaba.
He asked for an answer.	Ya nemi amsa.
He knows how to drive.	Ya san tuƙi.
It's beautiful around it.	Yana da kyau a kusa da shi.
I want to go home.	Ina so in koma gida.
Why they are there is unknown.	Me ya sa suke can ba a sani ba.
It is not required here.	Ba a bukatar shi a nan.
Try them out, and make sure they fit.	Gwada su, kuma a tabbata sun dace.
He should have raised women.	Ya kamata ya daga mata.
And of course a lot of things would have been sold.	Kuma tabbas da an sayar da abubuwa da yawa.
I really don't want to cut it.	Lallai bana son yanke shi.
That did not change anything.	Hakan bai canza komai ba.
We said again.	Muka ce kuma.
It takes a bit of familiarity.	Yana ɗaukar ɗan saba.
This is something entirely.	Wannan wani abu ne gaba ɗaya.
We kept walking.	Muka ci gaba da tafiya.
We do not know you.	Ba mu san ku ba.
We see what happened here.	Muna ganin abin da ya faru a nan.
But that's why she wants you to help her.	Amma shi ya sa take son ka taimaka mata.
After two days.	Bayan kwana biyu.
To know her.	Don sanin ta.
Maybe with a movie.	Wataƙila tare da fim.
You are and you know it.	Kai ne kuma ka san shi.
Give me something sweet, she said.	Ka ba ni wani abu mai dadi, ta ce.
They are not mine.	Ba nawa bane.
This is the second time.	Na biyu kenan.
Book A also decided to try it out.	Littafin A kuma ya yanke shawarar gwada shi.
He could not understand it.	Ya kasa gane hakan.
No, this will not be given to me.	A'a, wannan ba za a ba ni ba.
I remember the pain.	Na tuna zafi.
Please go not with me.	Don Allah a tafi ba ni ba.
I am not a police officer.	Ni ba dan sanda ba ne.
It has not rained yet.	Har yanzu ba a yi ruwan sama ba.
I will tell you it is time to act.	Zan ce muku lokaci ya yi da za a yi aiki.
Nor did we get any.	Haka kuma ba mu iya samun ko ɗaya ba.
But then things changed.	Amma sai abubuwa suka canza.
That he even recognized her was amazing.	Cewa har ya gane ta abin mamaki ne.
Don't worry, we have covered you.	Kar ku damu, mun rufe ku.
But they are also wrong.	Amma kuma sun yi kuskure.
I remember it very well.	Na tuna da shi sosai.
That's how it goes now.	Haka yake tafiya yanzu.
We all learned to sing at the same time.	Mu duka mun koyi yin waƙa a lokaci guda.
A bad feeling about it.	Wani mummunan ji game da shi.
The length of time it was last released was staggering.	Tsawon lokacin da aka sake shi na ƙarshe yana da ban mamaki.
Do this with fear of the unknown.	Yi haka tare da tsoron abin da ba a sani ba.
Have a nice day.	Wata rana mai kyau.
It will kill you.	Za ta kashe ka.
Man did this to himself.	Mutum ya yi wa kansa haka.
You love it.	Kuna son shi.
He is like everyone else.	Shi kamar kowa ne.
You only need to do it once.	Kuna buƙatar yin shi sau ɗaya kawai.
If you want a stick, buy a car that comes with one.	Idan kuna son sanda, ku sayi motar da ta zo da daya.
We can not even afford them at this time.	Ba za mu iya ma iya isa gare su a wannan lokacin.
Never swim.	Ba a taɓa yin iyo ba.
He can do this.	Zai iya yin wannan.
Others say it's just there.	Wasu kuma sun ce a can ne kawai.
I'm here.	Ina nan.
The story is here.	Labarin yana nan.
It's a scary way of life.	Hanya ce mai ban tsoro ta rayuwa.
He would stand there, without speaking.	Zai tsaya can, ba tare da yayi magana ba.
I do not want that to happen to me.	Ba na son hakan ya faru da ni.
I want to save	Ina so in ajiye
The dress reveals a lot of skin.	Rigar ta bayyana fata da yawa.
I did not answer her.	Ban amsa mata ba.
He played.	Ya buga wasa.
There is nowhere near to get a drink.	Babu inda kusa don samun abin sha.
They were arrested too.	An kama su ma.
And he wanted to do it properly.	Kuma ya so ya yi yadda ya kamata.
Take it easy on yourself.	Yi sauƙi a kan kanku.
How little do they know.	Yaya kadan suka sani.
He went to work on it yesterday.	Ya tafi aiki a kai jiya.
Likewise no one else.	Haka kuma babu wani.
She didn't get the right answer.	Ba ta samun amsa daidai ba.
Everyone wants to be the best though.	Kowa yana so ya zama mafi kyau ko da yake.
I can see he's gone.	Ina iya ganin ya tafi.
As for me.	Amma ni.
But they can be better.	Amma za su iya zama mafi kyau.
I saw that he was surprised and excited.	Na ga ya yi mamaki kuma ya ji daɗi.
Looking for him.	Neman sa.
We agree with that.	Mun yarda da hakan.
He closed them again.	Ya sake rufe su.
Come to us today !.	Ku zo mu yau!.
You do not agree with that.	Ba ku yarda da hakan ba.
How long is this true?	Har yaushe wannan gaskiya ne?
There is a similarity.	Akwai kama da hakan.
We drank a lot.	Mu sha da yawa.
And, of course, can not last more than a year.	Kuma, ba shakka, ba zai iya wuce shekara guda ba.
So the timing is wrong, that's it.	Don haka lokacin ba daidai ba ne, shi ke nan.
Absolutely nothing about that.	Babu shakka komai game da hakan.
When he was with her, she was scared.	Lokacin da yake tare da ita, sai ta ji tsoro.
Something a little strange about them.	Wani abu ne ɗan ban mamaki game da su.
Not only that.	Ba haka kawai ba.
And they are not alone.	Kuma ba su kaɗai ba ne.
So for years, that's what they used to do.	Don haka tsawon shekaru, abin da suke amfani da shi ke nan.
He drank a lot.	Ya sha abin sha da yawa.
I can’t say we will never do it.	Ba zan iya cewa ba za mu taba yi ba.
He almost annoyed her.	Sai da ya kusa bata mata rai.
I want to go swimming	Ina so in je yin iyo
I think there may be others.	Ina tsammanin za a iya samun wasu.
We lived.	Mun yi rayuwa.
You eat a lot of fast food.	Kuna cin abinci mai sauri da yawa.
It grows late.	Yana girma a makara.
Too much thought is nothing.	Tunani yayi yawa ba komai.
We will be safe.	Za mu kasance lafiya.
You know this is something like us.	Kun san wannan wani abu ne kamar mu.
I know it's not good to watch the movie.	Na san ba shi da kyau a kalli fim ɗin.
They sell things.	Suna sayar da abubuwa.
I'll just bring some reading material.	Zan kawo kayan karatu kawai.
So he got involved.	Don haka ya shiga hannu.
If you were you what would you do?	Idan kai ne me za ka yi?
The rest are few.	Sauran ba su da yawa.
It does not belong to man.	Ba na mutum ba ne.
Talk to me about the biggest problem.	Yi min magana game da matsala mafi girma.
This happened once.	Wannan ya faru sau ɗaya.
Of course this is correct.	Tabbas wannan daidai ne.
He did not answer and went ahead.	Bai amsa ba ya wuce gaba.
She knew she had made a mistake.	Ta san ta yi kuskure.
She closed the door slowly.	Ta rufe kofar a hankali.
We sat down to lunch.	Muka zauna cin abincin rana.
Once, one helped us.	Sau ɗaya, ɗaya ya taimake mu.
What.	Menene.
Don't ask me anything.	Kar ka tambaye ni komai.
She went with someone else.	Ta tafi da wani ma.
Many people came to see the event.	Mutane da dama ne suka zo ganin taron.
They arrested me.	Sun kama ni.
It's too hot.	Yayi zafi sosai.
I run for pleasure.	Ina gudu saboda abin jin daɗi.
It turns out they were right.	Sai ya zama sun yi gaskiya.
I enjoy watching them.	Ina jin daɗin kallon su.
Can't name a single song.	Ba za a iya sunan waƙa ɗaya ba.
You must understand this.	Dole ne ku fahimci wannan.
I seem to be having trouble almost all the time now.	Ina da alama ina samun matsala kusan kowane lokaci yanzu.
That brought me back.	Hakan ya dawo da ni.
I even removed it.	Har ma na cire shi.
She wasn’t, once.	Ba ta kasance, sau ɗaya ba.
Apparently we are among the last to come.	Da alama muna cikin na ƙarshe da suka zo.
Now look about you.	Yanzu duba game da ku.
They like you or they don't like you.	Suna son ku ko kuma ba sa so.
She has been in this house for thirty years.	Ta yi shekara talatin a gidan nan.
There is a great opportunity to do well in the area.	Akwai babban damar yin kyau a wurin.
It was as true as thought.	Ya kasance gaskiya kamar yadda tunani.
He helped me.	Ya taimake ni.
Don't worry about time.	Kar ku damu da lokaci.
They are right now.	Sun kasance daidai yanzu.
Here you go.	Nan ka tafi.
But of course you will not.	Amma ba shakka ba za ku yi ba.
They love the game.	Suna son wasan.
About a lot of things.	Game da abubuwa da yawa.
Or maybe they haven’t got it yet.	Ko watakila ba su samu ba tukuna.
You can just tell how she lives there.	Za ka iya kawai gaya yadda take zaune a can.
Someone died because of me.	Wani mutum ya mutu saboda ni.
I don’t get any of it.	Ba na samun ko ɗaya daga gare shi.
I know he doesn't really trust me, but he does.	Na san bai yarda da ni da gaske ba, amma hakan yayi daidai.
He did not have to tell her.	Ba sai ya gaya mata ba.
Not the name of life, but that was to be expected.	Ba sunan rai ba, amma hakan ya kasance ana tsammanin.
She always loved me at the time.	Kullum tana son ni a lokacin.
I tried, interesting sure.	Na gwada, ban sha'awa tabbas.
The world will change.	Duniya za ta canza.
It shows behind.	Ya nuna a baya.
Maybe she missed it.	Watakila ta rasa shi.
I will come.	Zan zo.
It's nothing.	Ba komai bane.
Thus.	Ta haka .
Not that they were successful.	Ba tare da cewa sun yi nasara ba.
I will tell you.	Zan gaya muku.
But maybe they have.	Amma watakila suna da.
I am the best of the dead.	Ni ne mafi kyawun wanda ya mutu.
We have already completed this.	Mun riga mun gama wannan.
We got one.	Mun samu daya.
It is raining.	Ya yi ruwan sama.
Interesting, but there is still something problematic.	Abin sha'awa, amma har yanzu akwai wani abu na matsala.
If we speak quickly, we can take longer.	Idan muka yi magana da sauri, za mu iya ɗaukar hankali tsawon lokaci.
I think it is coming.	Ina ganin yana zuwa.
Some time here.	Dan lokaci a nan.
He can use the drink on the way home.	Zai iya amfani da abin sha a hanyar gida.
He kept coming and going.	Ya kasance yana zuwa yana tafiya.
Keep trying, and you will get there.	Ci gaba da ƙoƙari, kuma za ku isa can.
I am not good at such materials.	Ba ni da kyau a irin wannan kayan.
But it is work.	Amma shi aiki ne.
This request was rejected.	An ƙi wannan buƙatar.
Now it's time to show you how.	Yanzu ya yi da za a nuna maka yadda.
They just go out.	Suna fita kawai.
People develop so much about work that it is difficult.	Mutane suna ci gaba da yawa game da aiki yana da wahala.
I seem to remove it though.	Ina da alama in cire shi ko da yake.
There are many more.	Akwai sauran abubuwa da yawa kuma.
Either tonight, or at the time.	Ko a daren yau, ko kuma a lokacin.
They do this thing and it is good.	Suna yin wannan abu kuma yana da kyau.
I did not understand what the man was saying.	Ban gane abin da mutumin yake fada ba.
I find this problem to be surprising.	Na ga wannan matsalar tana da ban mamaki.
And we are on our way to that.	Kuma muna kan hanyar zuwa haka.
Their owners cannot kill them, or sell them outside.	Masu su ba za su iya kashe su ba, ko sayar da su a waje.
If he does, he should return to the truth, otherwise lie.	Idan ya yi, ya kamata ya dawo gaskiya, in ba haka ba karya.
Help me.	Taimake ni.
People live here.	Mutane suna zaune a nan.
He wanted to add.	Ya so ya kara cewa.
I came to help her, too.	Na zo ne in taimake ta, haka ma.
And that will not change.	Kuma hakan ba zai canza ba.
He did not appear.	Bai bayyana ba.
Okay, you thought about me, great.	Lafiya, kun yi tunani game da ni, mai girma.
I asked her to come out with me next week.	Na nemi ta fita da ni mako mai zuwa.
You do not hear.	Ba ku ji ba.
Get up early tomorrow.	Tashi da wuri gobe.
I saved it for myself.	Na ajiye wa kaina.
That's where the story begins.	Daga nan ne labarin ya fara.
Or early.	Ko kuma da wuri.
They heard it.	Suka ji shi.
He is tired of walking.	Ya gaji da tafiya.
Hard to imagine.	Da wuya a yi tunanin.
She doesn't have to prove anything.	Ba sai ta tabbatar da komai ba.
It's hard to imagine now.	Yana da wuya a yi tunanin yanzu.
But now there is a problem.	Amma yanzu akwai matsala.
Because of him.	Saboda shi.
I have written about it before.	Na rubuta game da shi a baya.
He said he did not want her to feel that way.	Yace baya son ta ji haka.
But that does not have to be the case.	Amma ba lallai ne hakan ya kasance ba.
Good job.	Aiki masu kyau.
He said until tomorrow.	Yace sai gobe.
But that doesn't make sense.	Amma hakan bai sa ya dace ba.
You can start the flight.	Kuna iya fara jirgin.
Tomorrow may re-hope.	Gobe ​​zai iya sake fata.
I can also tell you.	Zan iya kuma gaya muku.
And maybe she has a second thought.	Kuma watakila tana da tunani na biyu.
Every week.	Kowane mako guda.
I was very happy.	Na yi farin ciki sosai.
Here is the morning.	Ga safe.
Another will.	Wani kuma zai yi.
But we were.	Amma mun kasance.
I am not you.	Ni ba kai ba ne.
Stop for a second.	Tsaya na biyu.
Ask her to sit down for dinner.	Ka tambaye ta ta zauna don cin abincin dare.
Look at what happened.	Ka kalli abin da ya faru.
He is not sure if he will get a third.	Bai tabbata zai samu na uku ba.
Nothing is happening.	Babu wani abu da ke faruwa.
Maybe just good.	Wataƙila kawai mai kyau.
I can see there.	Ina iya gani a can.
I can't believe that.	Ba zan iya yarda da hakan ba.
He just went the wrong way.	Sai kawai ya shiga hanyar da ba ta dace ba.
Life on the road makes it.	Rayuwa a hanya ta sa shi.
It's everything.	Yana da komai.
The laughter was surprising.	Abin dariya ya ba da mamaki.
Time does so.	Lokaci yayi haka.
I don't know how to finish this job right now.	Ban san yadda zan gama wannan aikin ba a yanzu.
No one died.	Babu wanda ya mutu.
We may feel like we are the only ones seeing the problem.	Muna iya jin kamar mu ne kawai muke ganin matsalar.
He didn't even call.	Bai ma kira ba.
No answer came.	Babu amsa da ya zo.
Drink as much as you want.	Yawan shan abin da kuke so.
I like the way you think.	Ina son yadda kuke tunani.
Try to go.	Yi ƙoƙari ku tafi.
It is hard to believe she is not here.	Yana da wuya a yarda ba ta nan.
They are the same people as us.	Mutane daya ne da mu.
I want to know if I missed something.	Ina so in sani ko na rasa wani abu.
You can not explain why.	Ba za ku iya bayyana dalilin da ya sa ba.
For your favorite things.	Don abubuwan da kuke so.
He used common sense.	Ya yi amfani da hankali.
After about a week.	Bayan kamar mako guda.
He should be real himself.	Ya kamata ya zama ainihin kansa.
It was interesting to get it there.	Yana da ban sha'awa don samun shi a wurin.
I'm not entirely sure where to start.	Ban tabbata gaba ɗaya daga ina zan fara ba.
We will get that much.	Za mu sami hakan da yawa.
Like us, someone said.	Kamar mu, wani ya ce.
But this time, it was necessary.	Amma a wannan lokacin, ya zama dole.
Workers need to be heard.	Ana buƙatar jin masu aiki.
He called me.	Ya kira ni.
They found the car.	Suka sami motar.
He spoke to himself only now.	Ya yi magana da kansa kawai yanzu.
We are not close, though we want to be.	Ba mu kusa ba, ko da yake muna so mu kasance.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
I will do this thing.	Zan yi wannan abu.
Walk from the sun.	Tafiya daga rana.
The man is watching you.	Mutumin yana kallon ku.
Very little is called.	Kadan ne aka kira.
Learn to love yourself.	Koyi son kanku.
He did not fight.	Bai yi fada ba.
They will have something.	Za su da wani abu.
Assume that this is not true.	A ɗauka cewa wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
This requires more water to finish it.	Wannan yana buƙatar fiye da ruwa don gama shi.
With a look of great interest.	Tare da kallon babban abin sha'awa.
And of course he's looking for coffee.	Kuma tabbas yana neman kofi.
We should not have told him.	Da bai kamata mu gaya masa ba.
She waited for me to tell her more.	Ta jira in kara gaya mata.
Everything is closed.	An rufe komai.
If this.	Idan wannan.
We must seize this opportunity.	Dole ne mu yi amfani da wannan damar.
Please help me to help them.	Don Allah a taimake ni in taimake su.
That's what everyone has.	Abin da kowa ke da shi ke nan.
This is a big house that someone is waiting to build.	Wannan babban gida ne da ake jiran wani ya yi.
Don't worry about how often this happens.	Kar ku damu da sau nawa hakan ke faruwa.
Maybe she made a mistake.	Wataƙila ta yi kuskure.
I can't do it anymore.	Ba zan iya ba kuma.
I don't want you to touch me again.	Ba na so ka sake taba ni.
Unlike other people.	Ba kamar sauran mutane ba.
Let's not add.	Kada mu kara.
Much more than he might have thought.	Da yawa fiye da yadda zai yi tunani.
I do not know when it is.	Ban san lokacin da yake ba.
It's just amazing.	Abin mamaki ne kawai.
She is very sick.	Bata da lafiya sosai.
There is not much to say.	Babu wani abu da yawa da za a ce.
I think you are traveling.	Ina ganin ku kuna tafiya.
We will worry about that later.	Za mu damu da hakan daga baya.
There is no place like home.	Babu wuri kamar gida.
I don't know how to do it all the time.	Ban san yin shi ba koyaushe.
It is another world.	Wata duniya ce.
Then something funny happened.	Sai wani abu mai ban dariya ya faru.
Even after you were arrested.	Ko bayan an kama ku.
She said no, no she could not do that.	Ta ce a'a, a'a ba za ta iya hakan ba.
We are ahead, she is past.	Mu ne gaba, ita ta wuce.
It has a new name.	Yana da wani sabon suna.
The place could not be found easily.	Ba a iya samun wurin cikin sauƙi ba.
But no one took me all that way.	Amma ba wanda ya kai ni duka haka.
But it should not be.	Amma bai kamata ba.
He spent time wondering what others were thinking.	Ya wuce lokacin yana tunanin me wasu ke tunani.
She did not spend a day at home.	Ba ta yi kwana daya a gida ba.
She often does.	Tana yawan yi.
This is exactly where you need to be.	Wannan shine ainihin inda kuke buƙatar zama.
There is little he can not do.	Akwai kadan da ba zai iya yi.
Everyone loves it !.	Kowa yana son shi!.
You can't leave her and that's it.	Ba za ku bar ta ba kuma shi ke nan.
But if we do this, they will succeed.	Amma idan muka yi wannan abu, za su yi nasara.
Imagine if the person didn't care.	Ka yi tunanin idan mutumin bai damu ba.
Who knows where it came from?	Wa ya san inda ya fito?
We'd love to help you check it out !.	Za mu so mu taimake ku duba shi!.
Needless to say, he was scared.	Ba sai an fada ba, ya ji tsoro.
Everything is fine.	Komai yayi kyau.
I work for you.	Ina yi muku aiki.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Kamar wannan abin ban dariya ne.
It seems that only one boat was involved.	Da alama jirgin ruwa daya ne ya shiga ciki.
And at that moment it seems we are there.	Kuma a wannan lokacin da alama muna can.
I will kill her.	zan kashe ta.
Come, all of you, and let us eat.	Ku zo kowa, mu ci abinci.
Focus on the book.	Mai da hankali kan littafin.
Now, everything is up.	Yanzu, komai yana sama.
Opportunity, though, does not appear.	Damar, ko da yake, bai bayyana ba.
I want you to know.	Ina so ku sani.
This is what they see.	Abin da suke gani ke nan.
I think a lot of people wanted it to be.	Ina tsammanin mutane da yawa sun so ta kasance.
Life is very difficult.	Rayuwa ta yi wuya sosai.
This has been called for many years.	An kira haka shekaru da yawa.
She can swim fast.	Za ta iya yin iyo da sauri.
May you live long and happy life!	Allah ka yi tsawon rai da farin ciki!
Had we been through something.	Da mun kasance ta hanyar wani abu.
How long have we met?	Tun yaushe muka hadu?
I'll be back now, he heard ?.	Zan dawo yanzu, ya ji?.
The front took over, but it did not open.	Gaba ya dauka, amma bai bude ba.
If we are here, we are here.	Idan muna nan, muna nan.
I made a mistake.	Na samu kuskure.
We like to work on the weekends.	Muna son yin aiki a karshen mako.
But you won't miss dinner tonight.	Amma ba za ku wuce abincin dare yau ba.
Sorry.	Yayi hakuri.
But they made us who we are.	Amma sun sanya mu wanda muke.
She went out.	Ta fita.
I knew they would eventually arrest me.	Na san za su kama ni a ƙarshe.
He said one of us.	Yace daya daga cikin mu.
Someone will hear something.	Wani zai ji wani abu.
But, he wants to talk a lot.	Amma, yana son yin magana da yawa.
In the end, she succeeded.	A ƙarshe, ta yi nasara.
But she did not want to tell me anything more.	Amma ba ta son ta kara gaya min komai.
This is right on the money.	Wannan daidai ne akan kudi.
But you brought it.	Amma kun kawo shi.
I recommend using it.	Ina ba da shawarar amfani da shi.
We used to be more than one and two.	Mun kasance muna zama fiye da ɗaya fiye da biyu.
These are just personal feelings.	Waɗannan su ne kawai ji na kaina.
But no one knows.	Amma ba wanda ya sani.
You remember it.	Kuna tuna shi.
Kids are wearing cool clothes.	Yara suna sanye da kayan sanyi.
We are going right.	Muna tafiya daidai.
Go, but be careful.	Ku tafi, amma ku yi hankali.
Surprisingly, very few people read music right now.	Abin ban mamaki, mutane kaɗan ne ke karanta waƙa a yanzu.
She just admitted that there was.	Kawai ta yarda cewa akwai.
Until the school started.	Har aka fara makaranta.
It should be said below.	Ya kamata a ce a kasa.
So, it is always good to be careful.	Don haka, yana da kyau koyaushe a kula.
We do not know how.	Ba mu san yadda ba.
She drank a lot.	Ta sha ruwa sosai.
I started doing one for myself to see how it went.	Na fara yi wa kaina daya don ganin yadda abin yake.
Children must be taken care of at all times.	Dole ne a kula da yara koyaushe.
He checked to see if anyone knew.	Ya duba ko akwai wanda ya sani.
We are almost here.	Muna kusan nan.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Wataƙila wata rana, amma ba tukuna.
From the house.	Daga gidan.
In fact he was told he was not going.	A gaskiya aka gaya masa ba ya tafi.
He will love it.	Zai so shi.
The bigger the go, the more pay.	Babban ya tafi, mafi yawan biya.
They like it.	Sun so shi.
I got staff.	Na sami 'yan aiki.
It is also the time of year.	Lokaci ne na shekara kuma.
He thought of me.	Ya yi tunani na.
I'm not feeling well.	Ba ni da daɗi.
You know you like it.	Kun san kuna so.
It's not enough time.	Bai isa lokaci ba.
I need to turn off in order to work.	Ina bukata in kashe don in yi aiki.
I'm sorry.	Ina hakuri.
This is a great thing.	Wannan abu ne mai girma.
Get up please, son.	Tashi don Allah, dan.
Everyone got a word.	Kowa ya samu magana.
That is the problem.	Wannan ita ce matsalar.
It's not interesting.	Ba abin sha'awa ba ne.
I have a name	Ina da suna
I just forgot the meeting.	Kawai na manta taron.
They know and care about me.	Sun fi sani kuma sun kula da ni.
I just love it.	Ina son shi kawai.
There must be something you fear.	Dole ne akwai abin da kuke tsoro.
Who knows where he was the other day.	Wanene ya san inda yake a ranar da ta gabata.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Ban tabbata abin da ke faruwa ba.
It will only change the borrower.	Zai canza mai bashi kawai.
Another thing.	Wani abu kuma.
I want this to work really well.	Ina son wannan ya yi aiki sosai.
I just love it.	Ina son shi kawai.
I will not do that.	Ba zan yi haka ba.
So keep this in mind.	Don haka ku tuna da wannan.
They will continue to work with us.	Za su ci gaba da aiki tare da mu.
It's very exciting.	Abin farin ciki ne sosai.
But some things need to be clarified.	Amma ya kamata a bayyana wasu abubuwa.
But, he also thought that there was nothing after life.	Amma, ya kuma yi tunanin cewa babu wani abu bayan rayuwa.
It is what happens.	Yana da abin da ke faruwa.
And yet it is.	Duk da haka shi ne.
I agree to wait.	Na yarda in jira.
But now it is not finished.	Amma yanzu ba a gama ba.
I know all of these.	Na san duk waɗannan.
But it didn’t feel like enough.	Amma bai ji kamar isa ba.
I did not get it.	Ban samu ba.
That nothing is lost.	Cewa komai ba a rasa ba.
We were in the past.	Mun kasance a baya.
Lots of food was provided.	An ba da abincin da yawa.
Something else looks similar.	Wani abu kuma ya yi kama.
After that we can not say anything at this time.	Bayan haka ba za mu iya cewa komai ba a wannan lokacin.
I fell from the top of my head.	Na kasa daga kai na sama.
One person did not indicate where they lived.	Mutum daya bai nuna inda suke zaune ba.
However, this is not true.	Duk da haka, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Now is not the time.	Yanzu ba lokacin ba ne.
You know how to feel when you are scared or excited.	Kuna san ji lokacin da kuke jin tsoro ko jin daɗi.
Save water.	Ajiye ruwa.
So make an immediate effort to stay together.	Don haka ku yi ƙoƙarin ku nan da nan don ku zauna tare.
This is the time to act.	Wannan shine lokacin da za a yi aiki.
This is amazing.	Wannan abin ban mamaki ne.
So she was very intelligent.	Don haka sai ta kasance mai hankali.
They are all women.	Duk mata ne.
I do not need your money.	Bana buƙatar kuɗin ku.
The actual method is used when appropriate.	Ana amfani da ainihin hanyar idan ta dace.
Think about what you do.	Yi tunanin abin da kuke yi.
This is one thing.	Wannan abu daya ne.
We didn’t watch a hard time or anything.	Ba mu kallon lokaci mai wuya ko wani abu ba.
And it did not accomplish anything.	Kuma bai cika komai ba.
I see exactly through them.	Ina gani daidai ta wurin su.
I'm trying very hard.	Ina ƙoƙari sosai.
Everyone has them.	Kowa yana da su.
I did not look inside.	Ban duba ciki ba.
She knows everything about him.	Ta san komai game da shi.
No one knows how to get started.	Ba wanda ya san yadda za a fara.
I have to play.	Dole ne in yi wasa.
I will not be here.	Ba zan kasance a nan ba.
We want to be a role model.	Muna so mu zama abin koyi.
Leave the boat.	Bar jirgin ruwa.
Something similar.	Wani abu kama.
I don't want to spend the night there.	Ba na son in kwana a can.
It is good to get here.	Yana da kyau a samu a nan.
You never know how or when you will die.	Ba ku taɓa sanin ta yaya ko lokacin da za ku mutu ba.
It all seemed so simple at the time.	Duk ya kasance kamar mai sauƙi a lokacin.
But she did not speak to me.	Amma bata min magana.
Let him learn to know himself.	Bari ya koyi sanin kansa.
Make sure you are on board tomorrow.	Tabbatar cewa kuna cikin jirgin gobe.
They know how to feel when it comes, however.	Sun san jin lokacin da ya zo, duk da haka.
Or after all that happened.	Ko bayan duk abin da ya faru.
For once he seemed to do nothing.	Don sau ɗaya kamar bai yi komai ba.
Come early for dinner.	Ku zo da wuri don abincin dare.
Many speakers did little.	Masu yin magana da yawa ba su yi wani abu kaɗan ba.
Food, the best.	Abinci, mafi kyau.
One plane.	Jirgin sama daya.
Here is what happened.	Ga abin da ya faru.
He did not die so that we would not die.	Bai mutu ba don kada mu mutu.
That's sad.	Abin bakin ciki kenan.
So, that's it, really.	Don haka, shi ke nan, da gaske.
They are much bigger.	Sun fi haka girma.
Things are happening, he said.	Abubuwa suna faruwa, in ji shi.
But it is getting better.	Amma yana samun kyau.
Here are some.	Ga wasu.
This is simple and easy.	Wannan mai sauƙi ne kuma mai sauƙi.
He got up immediately.	Nan take ya tashi.
I do not know what to say.	Ban san ainihin abin da zan ce ba.
Not sure what was going on.	Ban tabbata me ke faruwa ba.
I want you to have the best of everything.	Ina so ku sami mafi kyawun komai.
She made me for this book.	Ta sanya ni don wannan littafin.
We don't want to play this game.	Ba ma son yin wannan wasan.
He could have, but he did not.	Zai iya samu, amma bai samu ba.
They have one daughter.	Suna da 'ya daya.
You should work carefully.	Ya kamata ku yi aiki a hankali.
Read the original article.	Karanta ainihin labarin.
Time to move on.	Lokaci don ci gaba.
Let him speak.	Bari yayi magana.
Maybe he was in.	Wataƙila ya kasance a.
Hurry up, move on!	Da sauri, ci gaba!
We know about it now though.	Mun san game da shi yanzu ko da yake.
She became very ill after that.	Ta yi rashin lafiya sosai bayan wannan.
One who should not die.	Wanda bai kamata ya mutu ba.
Now go to your room.	Yanzu je dakin ku.
Nice to try, anyway.	Ya yi kyau a gwada, ko ta yaya.

He is always interested in playing.	Koyaushe yana sha'awar yin wasa.
Or read about it.	Ko karanta game da shi.

However, it is not.	Duk da haka, ba haka ba.

And this is not good.	Kuma wannan ba kyau ba ne.
You cannot identify the person who has done us good.	Ba za ku iya gane mutumin da ya yi mana kyau ba.
He said he would protect me.	Yace zai kare ni.
I think someone said the best.	Ina tsammanin wani ya ce mafi kyau.
We need work.	Muna bukatar aiki.
She was not.	Ba ta kasance ba.
We could not live with it.	Ba mu iya zama da ita ba.
He is a very good man.	Mutum ne mai kyau sosai.
He probably will never find you in it.	Wataƙila ba zai taɓa samun ku a ciki ba.
He did not know them.	Bai san su ba.
So we decided that she should learn to swim.	Saboda haka, mun yanke shawarar cewa ta koyi yin iyo.
It is very intelligent.	Yana da hankali sosai.
Even bigger than before.	Ko da girma fiye da da.
It is well prepared.	An shirya sosai.
Hopefully you will find a way to fix it.	Da fatan za ku sami hanyar gyara shi.
But no one thought.	Amma babu wanda ya yi tunani.
He was in the ark.	Ya kasance a cikin jirgin.
Maybe I wanted him to keep playing with it.	Wataƙila na so ya ci gaba da wasa da shi.
There is nothing wrong with how he feels, really.	Babu wani abu da ya dace da yadda yake ji, da gaske.
We see this in many things.	Mun ga wannan a cikin abubuwa da yawa.

He is tired of walking.	Ya gaji da tafiya.
For a while everything was there.	Na ɗan lokaci komai yana nan.
He said the timing of the talks was inappropriate.	Yace lokacin magana bai dace ba.
Good effort though.	Kyakkyawan ƙoƙari ko da yake.
Today we got up early, he said.	Yau mun tashi da wuri, in ji shi.
She, however, is not difficult.	Ita, duk da haka, ba ta da wuya.
But she is needed.	Amma ana bukatar ta.
I'm tired of waiting here.	Na gaji da jira a nan.
Maybe she was right.	Wataƙila ta yi gaskiya.
So we are not looking at this anymore.	Don haka ba ma kallon wannan kuma.
He ate his favorite food.	Ya ci abincin da ya fi so.
Nor should it come as a surprise.	Haka kuma bai kamata hakan ya zo da mamaki ba.
Exactly what she was hoping for in the first place.	Daidai abin da take fata tun farko.
He had to save her.	Dole ya ajiye ta.
Not about me.	Ba game da ni ba.
She wanted real life.	Ta so rayuwa ta gaske.

You have to think hard for me.	Dole ne ku yi mini tunani sosai.

He still feels.	Har yanzu yana ji.
I do not know anyone so.	Ban san kowa haka ba.
It seems to have changed.	Da alama ya canza.
I know the name.	Na san sunan.
In the end, a little caution is necessary.	Zuwa ƙarshe, ɗan hankali ya zama dole.

But that is gone now.	Amma wannan ya tafi yanzu.
Not here before.	Ba a nan a da.

He closed the door.	Ya rufe kofar.

Okay, he thought.	Yayi kyau, yayi tunani.

Or, one day we heard he was dead.	Ko kuma, wata rana mun ji ya mutu.

When she was happy, he knew.	Lokacin da ta yi farin ciki, ya sani.

After all, we need you safe.	Bayan haka, muna buƙatar ku lafiya.

Sometimes things work out well, and sometimes they don't.	Wani lokaci abubuwa suna yin aiki da kyau, wani lokacin kuma ba su yi ba.
What she just wanted to do.	Abin da ta ke so kawai ta yi.
You know what will happen.	Kun san abin da zai faru.

Tomorrow morning, boy.	Gobe ​​da safe, yaro.

If doing so works for you, then it's right.	Idan yin hakan yana aiki a gare ku, hakan yayi daidai.

Money helps, but it is not the only thing.	Kudi ya taimaka, amma ba shine kawai abin ba.

You can almost see.	Kusan kuna iya gani.
Swimming can be fun.	Yin iyo na iya zama mai daɗi.

But at twelve o'clock there was no rain or sun.	Amma karfe sha biyu ba ruwan sama ko rana.
You know the plan.	Kun san shirin.
We celebrate this inside.	Muna bikin wannan a ciki.
It's a small amount of money and a good investment.	Kudi ne kaɗan da kashe kuɗi da kyau.
We must find something else.	Dole ne mu gano wani abu kuma.
Something is blocking the way ahead.	Wani abu yana tare hanya a gaba.
And don't go there.	Kuma kada ku je wurin.
Of course, it is nothing.	Tabbas, ba komai ba ne.
This is even bigger.	Wannan ya fi girma.
But so it is.	Amma can ita ma haka take.

She does not speak.	Ita ma bata magana.
She is back.	Ta dawo.
They do not know who they are eating now.	Ba su san wanda suke ci yanzu ba.
Find out what this project will cost you.	Gano abin da wannan aikin zai kashe ku.
We have no one to call.	Ba mu da wani da za mu kira.
We tried that.	Mun gwada hakan.
It gives you pain when you want.	Yana ba ku zafi lokacin da kuke so.
Everything else will be talked about today.	Komai sauran yau za a yi magana a kansa.
I wish I could help her.	Da na so in taimake ta.
You say so!	Kuna so ni!
I do not know what to expect.	Ban san abin da zan jira ba.
Unlike handicrafts, which anyone can do.	Ba kamar aikin hannu ba, wanda kowa zai iya yi.
But it is not enough.	Amma bai isa ba.
They know each other a lot.	Sun san juna da yawa.
This happens, often.	Wannan yana faruwa, sau da yawa.
They also agreed.	Su ma sun yarda da shi.
Day after day.	Rana bayan rana ta.
I asked two people.	Na tambayi mutane biyu.
I knew she could.	Na san za ta iya.
They prepared delicious food.	Suka shirya abinci mai daɗi.
Sleep, maybe some dinner.	Yi barci, watakila wasu abincin dare.
He knew it was right.	Ya san daidai ne.

I don't want to miss her, you see.	Ba na son rasa ta, ka gani.
Apparently you were made with the right things.	Da alama an yi ku da abubuwan da suka dace.
Is that fast?	Shin hakan yayi sauri?.
I see the problem.	Ina ganin matsalar.
I'm sure of that.	Na tabbata da hakan.
They are well written.	An rubuta su da kyau.
No, it should not.	A'a, bai kamata ba.
It is not a lie.	Ba karya bane.
Sometimes we get nothing.	Wani lokaci ba mu sami komai ba.
I have two girls to take care of and everything has money.	Ina da 'yan mata guda biyu da zan kula da su kuma komai yana da kuɗi.
But not like what you think.	Amma ba kamar abin da kuke tunani ba.
But she could not wait.	Amma ta kasa jira.
Honestly, very good.	Gaskiya, mai kyau sosai.
Work fast now.	Yi aiki da sauri yanzu.
Or maybe a year later.	Ko watakila shekara bayan haka.
Before him.	Kafin shi.
He is looking for a job.	Yana neman aiki.
If you do well, you will feel better.	Idan ka yi kyau, za ka ji dadi.
I'm glad you agree.	Na yi farin ciki ka yarda.
She heard a noise.	Ta ji kara.
You know the wrong way.	Ka san hanyar ba ta da kyau.
We do not need to remove it.	Ba ma bukatar shi ya cire shi.
Three months later she was found to be pregnant.	Bayan wata uku aka gano tana da ciki.
I watched it all this weekend.	Na kalli duka wannan karshen mako.
Why her? 	Me yasa ta?
Otherwise nothing has changed.	In ba haka ba babu abin da ya canza.
He was really healthy on his own.	Ya kasance lafiya da gaske a kan kansa.
It is too late.	Dare yayi yawa.
They provide food.	Suna ba da abinci.
In the end, though, we talked a little bit.	A ƙarshe, ko da yake, mun ɗan yi magana.
You think one way and you feel another way.	Kuna tunanin wata hanya kuma kuna jin wata hanya.
Some are very good.	Wasu suna da kyau sosai.
He will never kill anyone.	Ba zai taba kashe kowa ba.
You are beautiful.	Kuna da kyau.
Then I lifted her head.	Sai na daga mata kai.
I'll get one.	Zan sami daya.
Laughter broke out again.	Dariya ta sake tashi.
They can talk about it later.	Za su iya magana game da shi daga baya.
The film is a bit boring, if not completely accepted.	Fim ɗin ya kasance mai daɗi, idan ba a yarda da shi gaba ɗaya ba.
No, it's better.	A'a, ya fi kyau.
It should not be a game.	Bai kamata wasa ba.
I have nothing against it.	Ba ni da komai a kansa.
We will only take the goods.	Za mu ɗauki kayan kawai.
Really?	Da gaske?
They will no longer worry about it.	Ba za su ƙara damu da shi ba.
But nothing seems to be working.	Amma da alama babu abin da ke aiki.
The water is likely to grow significantly this year.	Ruwa na iya yin girma sosai a wannan shekara.
The good you do is impressive.	Kyakkyawan da kuke yi yana da ban sha'awa.
No one can do it.	Babu wanda zai iya yi.

We will do this somehow.	Za mu yi haka ko ta yaya.

Good sleep is healthy.	Barci mai kyau ya dace da lafiya.
The demand was as it was.	Bukatar ta kasance kamar yadda aka yi.
The water is gone.	Ruwan ya tafi.
I took the time to look at everyone.	Na dauki lokaci don kallon kowa.
This is what this feels.	Wannan shi ne abin da wannan ya ji.
Hope you enjoy it.	Da fatan za ku ji daɗi.
Go out and buy, now.	Fita ku saya, a yanzu.
Together they grew up.	Tare suka girma.
At this point no one will worry.	A wannan lokacin babu wanda zai damu.
Maybe in the car.	Wataƙila a cikin motar ne.
What we heard from him.	Abin da muka ji daga gare shi.
It's not a new fight.	Ba sabon fada bane.
It makes you ask things.	Yana sa ka tambayi abubuwa.
But not because he does it right often.	Amma ba don ya yi daidai sau da yawa ba.
Bigger and bigger.	Babban kuma mafi girma.
People probably talk a lot.	Mutane tabbas suna magana da yawa.
Do this several times a day.	Yi haka sau da yawa a rana.
It should be all this.	Ya kamata ya kasance duk wannan.
They are many.	Suna da dama.
I want the truth.	Ina son gaskiya.
How it feels about you.	Yadda take game da kai.
No, that is not correct.	A'a, wannan ba daidai ba ne.
They are worried.	Sun damu.
Who knows what happened.	Wanene ya san abin da ya faru.
With us today this is a big challenge.	Tare da mu a yau wannan shine babban wahala.
We started to see something really interesting here.	Mun fara ganin wani abu mai ban sha'awa sosai a nan.
He should be at home now.	Ya kamata ya kasance a gida a yanzu.
No work required.	Babu aiki da ake bukata.
Like you really want them to know you.	Kamar kuna son su san ku da gaske.
He acted like a sleeper.	Ya yi kamar mai barci.
I give that thought.	Na ba da wannan tunanin.
I'll fill mine.	Zan cika nawa.
Better prepare yourself.	Gara shirya kanku.
Think of what success will be for them.	Ka yi tunanin yadda nasara za ta kasance a gare su.
It looks and feels right.	Kallon ne kuma yayi daidai.
The rest of the night was not said.	Ba a ce sauran daren ba.
You really want to lose it now.	Lallai yanzu kuna son rasa ta.
Keep eating.	Ku ci gaba da ci.
Life suits me.	Rayuwa ta dace da ni.
Not two, not three.	Ba biyu ba, ba uku ba.
He is a man like me.	Mutum ne kamar ni.
But some have asked how they are doing.	Amma wasu sun tambayi yadda za su biya.
I do not see.	ban gani ba.
They are both married and in good health.	Duk sun yi aure kuma suna nan lafiya.
He is looking for a good home.	Yana neman gida mai kyau.
They traveled from place to place.	Daga wuri zuwa wuri suka yi ta tafiya.
I know myself.	Na san kaina.
He will do it himself.	Zai yi da kansa.
We should not be.	Bai kamata mu kasance ba.
He did not speak very well.	Bai yi magana sosai ba.
But suppose you are right.	Amma a ce kun yi gaskiya.
I lost mine.	Na rasa nawa.
Quickly he covered them.	Da sauri ya rufe su.
Can you write what he said?	Za a iya rubuta abin da ya ce?
I do not let my child look at him.	Ba na barin yaro na ya kalli shi.
You put it close.	Kun sa shi kusa.
He wanted them to stay safe.	Ya so su zauna lafiya.
You have done too much for me.	Kun yi min yawa.
Now that feeling is back.	Yanzu wannan jin ya dawo.
We need to stop and find out what is going on.	Muna bukatar mu tsaya mu gano abin da ke faruwa.
These feel fast.	Waɗannan suna jin sauri.
This is not one.	Wannan ba shi da daya.
We know it’s not all about our money.	Mun san ba duka game da kuɗin mana ba ne.
And probably the best of what he did not do.	Kuma tabbas mafi kyawun abin da bai yi ba.
You wonder why you have never met anyone.	Kun yi mamakin dalilin da yasa ba ku taɓa samun wani ba.
I got home	Na samu gida
But this was really, really great.	Amma wannan ya kasance da gaske, da gaske mai girma.
Do not smoke near me.	Kar ku sha taba kusa da ni.
Well, he said that again.	Da kyau, ya sake cewa.
It looks like they have changed.	Kamar sun canza baya.
Failure to do so will result in their removal.	Rashin yin haka zai ga an cire su.
It will not be a school.	Ba zai zama makaranta ba.
The time is right.	Lokacin yayi daidai.
This is beyond me.	Wannan ya wuce ni.
He was very happy to write.	Ya yi farin ciki sosai rubuta.
We learned this difficult way.	Mun koyi wannan hanya mai wuya.
This should be taken into account.	Wannan yakamata ya kara kula.
She shows one.	Ta nuna daya.
They shook hands.	Suka yi wa juna hannu.
That is what he needs to hear.	Abin da ya ke bukata kenan ya ji.
But she knew in that look that he had failed her.	Amma ta san ba hakan ya sa ya tsaya ba.
You must love them.	Dole ne ku so su.
Many are looking forward to more time.	Mutane da yawa suna fatan ƙarin lokaci.
And when it is called, we must get up.	Kuma idan an kira, dole ne mu tashi.
But he is not afraid.	Amma ba shi da tsoron hakan.
She makes them grow.	Ta sa su girma.
There is no way around it.	Babu wata hanya a kusa da shi.
Expect to ask them.	Yi tsammanin za ku tambaye su.
Not very big.	Ba girma sosai.
After all, things are not very good.	Bayan haka, abubuwa ba su da kyau sosai.
Materials are not enough.	Kayan abu ba su isa ba.
I write from them.	Ina rubuta daga gare su.
Do not eat too much!	Kada ku ci da yawa!
After that we will talk again.	Bayan haka za mu sake magana.
Waiting is the hardest part.	Jiran shine mafi wahala.
She could not think of anything.	Ba za ta iya tunanin komai ba.
There is nothing there.	Babu komai a wurin.
He was at work all day.	Ya kasance a wurin aiki duk rana.
I felt like everyone must know what happened to me.	Na ji kamar dole ne kowa ya san abin da ya faru da ni.
What was done was.	Abin da aka yi shi ne.
I want to be interested in what makes me happy.	Ina so in sami sha'awa da abin da ke sa ni farin ciki.
Some are good, some are not.	Wasu suna da kyau, wasu ba su da kyau.
No time to think about it.	Babu lokacin tunani game da shi.
He does everything right.	Yana yin komai daidai.
It was the usual material.	Ya kasance kayan da aka saba.
The project seems to be back on track now.	Aikin kamar ya dawo kan hanya yanzu.
I feel left out.	Na ji an bar ni da hakan.
The way to it.	Hanyar zuwa gare ta.
I'm very tired.	Na gaji sosai.
It will not be easy.	Ba zai zama da sauƙi ba.
This will take the most thought and effort.	Wannan zai ɗauki mafi yawan tunani da ƙoƙari.
You will leave this house, and you will never return.	Za ku bar gidan nan, kuma ba za ku dawo ba.
We need to try something like this.	Muna buƙatar gwada wani abu kamar wannan.
However, it is not the same thing.	Duk da haka, ba abu ɗaya ba ne.
I wish you and stay safe.	Ina fatan ku kuma ku zauna lafiya.
So we set off.	Sai muka tashi.
And of course we are.	Kuma tabbas muna.
He does nothing.	Ba ya yin komai.
The main requirements for them.	Babban abubuwan da ake bukata a gare su.
We played well on it.	Mun yi wasa da kyau a kai.
To be human.	Don zama mutum.
I don’t feel comfortable or comfortable in it.	Ba na jin dadi ko jin dadi a ciki.
You bring what you need.	Kuna kawo abin da kuke bukata.
No one likes her.	Ba wanda yake son ta.
For a moment, he was ready.	Na ɗan lokaci, ya shirya.
So a little time to do it.	Don haka ɗan lokaci kaɗan don yin shi.
We have shown that this did not happen.	Mun nuna cewa hakan bai faru ba.
Like you always do.	Irin ku koyaushe yana yi.
In the end, the film has to work.	A ƙarshe, fim ɗin dole ne ya yi aiki.
We have so much to do.	Muna da abubuwa da yawa da za mu yi.
Let me tell you it doesn’t work.	Bari in gaya muku cewa ba ya aiki.
I tried to write something like this.	Na yi ƙoƙarin rubuta wani abu kamar wannan.
No one can make us go so fast.	Babu wanda zai iya sa mu tafi da sauri haka.
You cannot do everything at once.	Ba za ku iya yin komai a lokaci ɗaya ba.
Now it has happened.	Yanzu abin ya faru.
No life, however, was not.	Babu rai, duk da haka, ba ta kasance ba.
He felt amazing to win.	Ya ji ban mamaki don cin nasara.
Let's make sure.	Mu tabbatar da hakan.
If it works, it works.	Idan yana aiki, yana aiki.
May.	Mai.
Do not drink too much too quickly.	Kar a sha da yawa da sauri.
I love that kind of life.	Ina son irin wannan rayuwa.
You will never catch him.	Ba za ku taba kama shi ba.
Use it when appropriate.	Yi amfani da shi lokacin da ya kamata.
Some want less at the same time.	Wasu suna son kadan a lokaci guda.
I heard it closed.	Na ji a rufe.
We cannot do that without them.	Ba za mu iya yin hakan ba tare da su ba.
Are you ready to go to sleep?	Kuna shirin yin barci.
I'm not sure if he will.	Ban tabbata ko zai yi ba.
Anyone can hear it.	Kowa na iya jin ta.
They are in pain.	Suna jin zafi.
I started reading.	Na fara karatu.
Maybe for you, he can.	Wataƙila a gare ku, zai iya.
She wants to talk to you.	Tana son magana da kai.
They want to work.	Suna son aiki.
I think they can get a lot of other benefits.	Ina tsammanin za su iya samun sauran amfani da yawa.
She is so beautiful.	Ta yi kyau sosai.
Please take some time to think.	Da fatan za a ɗauki ɗan lokaci don tunani.
You can even just walk.	Kuna iya ma tafiya kawai.
That is why it is here.	Shi yasa yake nan.
I get really good at this.	Ina samun kyau sosai a wannan.
Suddenly they have nothing to say to each other.	Nan da nan babu abin da za su ce wa juna.
No rain or rise.	Ba ruwan sama ko tashi.
I can't tell you how it happened.	Ba zan iya gaya muku yadda abin ya faru ba.
You must know.	Dole ne ku sani.
I think it is faster than last time.	Ina tsammanin ya fi sauri fiye da lokacin ƙarshe.
You have years and years.	Kuna da shekaru da shekaru.
Yet once it will not be.	Amma duk da haka sau ɗaya ba zai kasance ba.
It would be better that way.	Zai fi kyau haka.
This made them unhappy.	Hakan ya sa ba su ji daɗi ba.
But he did not say so.	Amma bai ce haka ba.
However it is not an easy task.	Duk da haka ba aiki mai sauƙi ba ne.
It's over.	Ya wuce.
I do this altogether.	Ina yin wannan gaba ɗaya.
The train is moving slowly.	Jirgin yana tafiya a hankali.
This is my favorite outdoor movie.	Wannan shine fim na waje da na fi so.
Maybe you are in the same boat.	Wataƙila kuna cikin jirgin ruwa ɗaya.
Some who were to stay at home began driving.	Wasu da za su zauna a gida sun fara tuƙi.
This also does not work here.	Wannan kuma baya aiki a nan.
It can not be.	Ba za a iya ba.
Likewise.	Haka kuma.
It's too fast.	An yi sauri.
But they have never seen anything like it before.	Amma ba su taɓa ganin irin wannan ba a da.
Yet they removed it.	Amma duk da haka sun cire shi.
Make it stop.	Ka sa ya tsaya.
Thus everything became more life-giving for me.	Ta haka komai ya zama mafi rai a gare ni.
But we can talk about that later.	Amma za mu iya yin magana game da hakan daga baya.
And we live there.	Kuma muna zaune a wurin.
Otherwise it will be.	Idan ba haka ba zai kasance.
I'll come with you, if that's what you want.	Zan zo tare da ku, idan abin da kuke so ke nan.
You get all this wrong.	Kuna samun wannan duka kuskure.
Out of service.	Ba ya aiki.
I refuse to work with you.	Na ƙi yin aiki tare da ku.
She is upset.	Ta bata rai.
We are not doing that right now.	Ba mu yin haka a yanzu.
The water stopped flowing until the sun came up.	Ruwa ya tsaya sai rana ta fito.
You just know them.	Ka san su kawai.
It's not over.	Bai kare ba.
I think it's a good thing.	Ina ganin abu ne mai kyau.
He played well today.	Ya buga wasan da kyau a yau.
I have what we need.	Ina da abin da muke bukata.
In many pieces.	A cikin guda da yawa.
At best, they will try to sell you something.	A mafi kyau, za su yi ƙoƙarin sayar muku da wani abu.
Once again, everything.	Har yanzu, komai.
We are very happy.	Mun yi farin ciki sosai.
Don't worry you will get it.	Kada ku damu za ku samu.
Nothing in the future will change.	Babu abin da zai faru nan gaba da aka canza.
They do not know.	Ba su sani ba.
There is still no happiness.	Har yanzu babu farin ciki.
I don’t know, either.	Ban sani ba, ni kuma.
Although the problem is not easy.	Ko da yake matsalar ba ta da sauƙi.
But that is difficult for us.	Amma hakan yana da wuya a gare mu.
I have never been ill to speak.	Ban taba rashin lafiya in yi magana ba.
The bad news is that we need money to live.	Mummunan gaskiya shine muna buƙatar kuɗi don rayuwa.
The police did well.	'Yan sanda sun yi kyau.
It's better than that.	Yana da kyau kasa da shi.
I did well with them.	Na yi kyau da su.
However, as well.	Duk da haka, kamar yadda kuma.
But to be a world player requires worldly thinking.	Amma don zama ɗan wasan duniya yana buƙatar tunani na duniya.
So we got two kids.	Don haka mun sami yara biyu.
Not what you think.	Ba abin da kuke tunani ba.
If you know me, you know this story.	Idan kun san ni, kun san wannan labarin.
People talked to me.	Mutane sun yi magana da ni.
He immediately responded.	Nan take ya amsa.
He is not very well.	Ba shi da lafiya sosai.
You can see it like this.	Kuna iya ganin hakan kamar haka.
Yet a little surprise from within shows.	Amma duk da haka abin mamaki kadan daga ciki ya nuna.
Happiness in general, really.	Farin ciki a gaba ɗaya, da gaske.
One by one, please come out.	Daya bayan daya, don Allah ku fito.
I want the world to be killed.	Ina so a kashe duniya.
I hope they are made.	Ina fata an yi su.
Do something amazing with it.	Yi wani abu mai ban mamaki da shi.
I want to help him get out immediately.	Ina so in taimake shi fita nan da nan.
She watched a horror movie last night.	Ta kalli wani fim mai ban tsoro a daren jiya.
No one looks like.	Babu wanda yayi kama.
The end comes with all.	Karshen ya zo da duka.
You did not understand this at first.	Ba ku fahimci wannan ba tun farko.
And he doesn’t know if he’s right.	Kuma bai sani ba ko yayi daidai.
We got it right.	Mun samu daidai.
Do not believe everything you get.	Kada ku yarda da duk abin da kuka samu.
And he took me with him.	Kuma ya tafi da ni tare da shi.
They will come through.	Za su zo ta hanyar.
I thought maybe.	Na yi tunani watakila.
Never smoke.	Kada ku taba shan taba.
And no one was there.	Kuma babu kowa a wurin.
There are so many things we do not know.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ba mu sani ba.
I have no laugh.	Ba ni da dariya.
We will have an exciting time.	Za mu sami lokaci mai ban sha'awa.
She wanted to go, now.	Ta so ta tafi, yanzu.
So we can lose people.	Don haka muna iya rasa mutane.
No answer is enough.	Babu amsa da ta isa amsa.
Not today.	Ba yau ba.
Read to each other at night.	Karanta wa juna da dare.
He was a great help from them.	Ya kasance taimako mai yawa daga gare su.
That's how we met.	A haka muka hadu.
I have played this game several times.	Na buga wannan wasan sau da yawa.
You so.	Kai don haka.
This has been proven.	An tabbatar da hakan.
But in the end it will be good and bring good.	Amma a ƙarshe zai zama mai kyau kuma ya kawo mai kyau.
I don’t eat this stuff, no.	Ba na cin wannan kayan, a'a.
Maybe he’s still asleep, in fact.	Wataƙila har yanzu yana barci, a gaskiya.
She's not smart.	Ba ta da hankali.
Get the police.	A samu 'yan sanda.
No one came close to helping her.	Babu wanda ya kusa taimaka mata.
No one has ever touched him.	Babu wani mutum da ya taɓa shi.
I hope this is not the case for you.	Ina fatan hakan ba haka yake gare ku ba.
Like the last time.	Kamar lokacin ƙarshe.
Every child can talk.	Kowane yaro yana iya magana.
I got one, not life, and she got two.	Na sami daya, ba rai, kuma ta sami biyu.
I can't explain it.	Ba zan iya bayyana shi ba.
I did not edit this material.	Ban gyara wannan kayan ba.
Don’t let it go over your head, but you’re fine.	Kada ku bar shi ya tafi kan ku, amma kuna da kyau.
I love him.	Ina son shi.
But somehow, something will be lost.	Amma ko ta yaya, wani abu zai rasa.
You are yourself.	Kai ne kai.
Only a few succeeded.	Wasu ne kawai suka yi nasara.
Do it well.	Yi kyau.
We can feel everything.	Muna iya jin komai.
Don't go and change anything.	Kar ka je ka canza komai.
She did not know that he would be interested in the world.	Ba ta san cewa zai yi sha'awar duniya ba.
I really am.	Ni da gaske nake.
We die on the go.	Mu mutu a kan tafiya.
I can think of one way.	Zan iya tunanin hanya daya.
If it is an easy task, maybe someone else can do it.	Idan aiki ne mai sauƙi, watakila wani zai iya yin shi.
Not really running.	Ba da gaske gudu.
As it should.	Kamar yadda ya kamata.
I happened to agree with her.	Na faru na yarda da ita.
I have to know for sure.	Dole ne in sani tabbas.
This car does not fit the road.	Wannan motar ba ta dace da hanya ba.
I have not changed.	Ban canza ba.
Prepare the tools carefully.	Shirya kayan aikin a hankali.
How exactly does this work?	Ta yaya daidai wannan yake aiki?
The water is gone.	Ruwan ya kare.
She will be cared for there.	Za a kula da ita a can.
They were not in that.	Ba su kasance cikin hakan ba.
He could not sleep last night.	Ya kasa yin barci a daren jiya.
Take the train.	Take jirgin kasa.
Reading is nothing.	Karatu ba komai ba ne.
She suffered terribly, and this made her very sad.	Ta sha wahala sosai, kuma abin ya bata mata rai sosai.
I think people just grow up because they grow up.	Ina tsammanin mutane kawai suna girma saboda sun girma.
If you had known the truth early.	Da kun gano gaskiya da wuri.
You can keep going.	Kuna iya ci gaba da ci gaba.
Your use will be guaranteed.	Za a tabbatar da amfani da ku.
But that is not enough.	Amma wannan bai isa ba.
One thing is for sure.	Abu daya ne a nan.
I hope this is better.	Ina fatan wannan ya fi kyau.
This is too much.	Wannan ya yi yawa.
He missed it.	Ya rasa shi.
They can do whatever they want.	Za su iya yin abin da suke so.
It is a waste of time.	Bata lokaci ne.
This work will be useful in the end.	Wannan aikin zai zama da amfani a ƙarshe.
John passed me a cup of coffee.	John ya wuce min kofi na kofi.
Excluding several other women.	Ban da wasu mata da dama.
Now three are growing inside.	Yanzu uku suna girma a ciki.
Suddenly things changed.	Nan da nan abin ya canza.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu abin da zai tabbatar.
They are coming here.	Suna zuwa nan.
We only have one world.	Duniya daya kawai muke da shi.
Find a job you think you will never get.	Nemi aikin da kuke tunanin ba za ku taɓa samu ba.
That can be very interesting.	Hakan na iya samun ban sha'awa sosai.
He saw it for sure.	Ya ga hakan ya tabbata.
I consider myself a little weak.	Na dauki kaina a dan rauni.
He doesn't really care about you.	Ba ya kula da kai sosai.
He never slept outside.	Bai taba kwana a waje ba.
It's scary.	Abu ne mai ban tsoro.
The car is helpful but not necessary.	Mota tana da taimako amma ba dole ba.
He participated in the program.	Ya shiga cikin wannan shirin.
We spent a week together.	Mun yi mako guda tare.
She must be there.	Dole ta kasance a wurin.
She wanted to be a role model.	Ta so ta zama abin koyi.
It's very scary.	Yana da matukar ban tsoro.
Everything is amazing so far.	Komai ban mamaki ya zuwa yanzu.
I told him about my day.	Na ba shi labarin rana ta.
This has never happened before.	Wannan bai taba faruwa a baya ba.
It’s not much but it’s there.	Ba shi da yawa amma yana can.
It was a great feeling.	Wani babban ji ne.
The others laughed.	Sauran suka yi dariya.
He brought him coffee and food.	Ya kawo masa kofi da abinci.
A little bit of it, in fact.	Kadan daga ciki, a gaskiya.
We know that day will come.	Mun san wannan ranar za ta zo.
It is better to come quickly.	Yana da kyau a zo da sauri.
She enjoyed the music in the house.	Ta ji daɗin waƙa a gidan.
You will never do it.	Ba za ku taba yi ba.
However we are not doing it nearly as well.	Duk da haka ba ma yin shi kusan yadda ya kamata.
Entirely by myself.	Gaba ɗaya da kaina.
I think this is life.	Ina tsammanin wannan rayuwa.
But here you are, not going home.	Amma kuna nan, ba za ku koma gida ba.
We need to go somehow.	Muna bukatar mu tafi ko ta yaya.
She growled.	Ta ƙara ƙara.
You can't do anything.	Ba za ku iya yin komai ba.
A simple statement of truth.	Magana mai sauƙi na gaskiya.
And the sun came out, but it had no light.	Kuma rana ta fito, amma ba ta sani ba.
Two people died.	Mutane biyu sun mutu.
That did not happen.	Hakan bai faru ba.
They can't fly from here.	Ba za su iya tashi sama daga nan ba.
I have to travel.	Dole ne in yi tafiya.
I can say that it is not pleasant.	Zan iya cewa ba ta da daɗi.
They should be here.	Ya kamata su kasance a nan.
Without even opening the door to your house.	Ba tare da ko da bude kofar gidan ku ba.
Where they are now, she wondered.	Ina suke yanzu, ta yi mamaki.
And this is one thing.	Kuma wannan abu daya ne.
I'll find out who else is.	Zan gano wanda kuma akwai.
Things are going well.	Abubuwa suna tafiya sosai.
He really wanted that.	Ya so haka sosai.
Nothing can go wrong right now.	Babu wani abu da zai iya yin kuskure a yanzu.
We are talking about food.	Muna fada akan abinci.
My head hurts about this job alone.	Kaina yayi zafi game da wannan aikin shi kaɗai.
But there you know what they did.	Amma a can ka san abin da suka yi.
You may have access.	Kuna iya samun dama.
And it is good to be so.	Kuma yana da kyau ya zama haka.
We are all looking at each other.	Mu duka muna kallon juna.
The same is true now.	Haka abin yake a yanzu.
Of course, there must be something.	Tabbas, dole ne akwai wani abu.
You understand now how it is.	Kun gane yanzu yadda yake.
We do not need this.	Ba ma buƙatar wannan.
He is still walking again.	Har yanzu yana tafiya kuma.
He admits he is a talkative man.	Ya yarda shi mutum ne mai yawan magana.
And it should be so.	Kuma ya kamata ya zama haka.
Now it is good.	Yanzu yana da kyau.
He is now.	Shi ne yanzu.
I enjoy doing things.	Ina jin daɗin yin abubuwa.
She has a job to do.	Tana da aikin yi.
And it has nothing.	Kuma ba shi da wani abu.
He does not want to upset us.	Ba ya so ya bata mana rai.
He is better than he was years old.	Ya yi kyau fiye da yadda yake da shekaru.
So, let’s see how we use it.	Don haka, bari mu ga yadda muke amfani da shi.
What a joy to be together!	Abin farin ciki ne da suka yi tare!
We’ve done a lot of good things here.	Mun yi abubuwa masu kyau da yawa a nan.
We left behind to say.	Muka bari a baya mu ce.
For a while, he was happy.	Na ɗan lokaci kaɗan, ya yi farin ciki.
I do not know what to do.	Ban san abin da zan yi ba.
All good.	Duk mai kyau.
No, not you.	A'a, ba ku ba.
The water is starting to fill up faster now.	Ruwan ya fara cika da sauri yanzu.
From where we are, we see no reason.	Daga inda muke, ba mu ga dalilin ba.
He read the same book he read with him.	Ya karanta littafin daya karanta tare da shi.
He appears to have made a home.	Ya bayyana ya yi gida.
The other players are weak.	Sauran 'yan wasan suna da rauni.
He raised his head but did not answer.	Ya daga kai amma bai amsa ba.
And they can succeed.	Kuma za su iya yin nasara.
He also sees now.	Shi ma yana gani yanzu.
Failed or correct.	Ya kasa ko daidai.
You are outside.	Kuna waje.
You want them to be next.	Kuna son su kasance masu zuwa.
She said she would take me home.	Ta ce za ta kai ni gida.
But let's wait.	Amma mu jira.
Not very good, but really very.	Ba sosai da kyau sosai, amma da gaske sosai.
You are not allowed to do that.	Ba a ba ku damar yin hakan ba.
You have done an amazing job.	Kun yi aiki mai ban mamaki.
This, and other things.	Wannan, da sauran abubuwan.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
A woman sat next to him.	Wata mata ta zauna kusa da shi.
Try this.	Gwada da wannan.
She never ran fast.	Bata taba gudu da sauri ba.
It happens to me a lot.	Yana faruwa da ni da yawa.
Everyone is nearby.	Kowa yana kusa da nan.
Let's go there.	Mu je can.
I have never seen.	Ban taba gani ba.
Then the room became cold.	Sai dakin yayi sanyi.
That can be a problem sometimes.	Cewa yana iya zama matsalar wani lokaci.
It has something in every hand.	Yana da wani abu a kowane hannu.
He does not want to see this happen again.	Baya son ganin hakan ya sake faruwa.
We tried to make them very small.	Mun yi ƙoƙari mu sa su kaɗan ne sosai.
We were alone in the room.	Mu kadai a dakin.
It's more comfortable.	Ya fi jin dadi.
I keep looking for more.	Ina ci gaba da neman ƙarin.
So they do.	Don haka suke yi.
Like me.	Kamar nawa.
Say something positive.	Ka ce wani abu mai kyau.
He said he did not care what people thought.	Ya ce bai damu da abin da mutane ke tunani ba.
Big little.	Babban kadan.
But this is just us.	Amma wannan mu ne kawai.
I do this once in a while myself.	Ina yin haka sau ɗaya a wani lokaci da kaina.
Who wants water?	Wanene ke son ruwa?
No one was injured.	Babu wanda ya samu rauni.
For most filmmakers, that's enough.	Ga mafi yawan ’yan fim, ya isa haka.
So what lies ahead is well defined.	Don haka an bayyana abin da ke gaba da kyau.
The thought made him think.	Tunanin hakan ya sa shi sabon tunani.
It made me think.	Ya sa na yi tunani.
He studied hard.	Yayi karatu sosai.
You will have to wait for someone else.	Za ku jira wani.
The one that fascinated me.	Wanda ya bani sha'awa.
He wants that.	Yana son hakan.
Kids to play outside.	Yara su yi wasa a waje.
They want to be prepared.	Suna son a shirya.
However, nothing could be further from the truth.	Ko ta yaya, babu wani abu da zai iya wuce gaskiya.
But now, it makes me feel really good.	Amma a yanzu, ya sa na ji daɗi sosai.
We do not have many toys.	Ba mu da kayan wasan yara da yawa.
Many things can happen at this time.	Abubuwa da dama na iya faruwa a wannan lokacin.
The game is played.	An buga wasa.
Fixed.	An gyara shi.
Let me call the police.	Bari in kira 'yan sanda.
We all went backwards.	Mu duka muka koma baya.
Give your favorite.	Ba da abin da kuka fi so.
They leave the room and close the door.	Suna fita daga dakin suka rufe kofar.
Nothing interesting.	Babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa.
And that's when she met him.	Kuma a lokacin ne ta hadu da shi.
This, however, by the way.	Wannan, duk da haka, ta hanyar.
He wanted that.	Da ya so haka.
And a child in the background.	Kuma yaro a baya.
That said, try it with a hobby once in a while.	Wannan ya ce, ya yi ƙoƙari tare da aikin sha'awa sau ɗaya.
Try not to stay here overnight.	Yi ƙoƙarin kada ku zauna a nan har tsawon dare.
Not the real story, anyway.	Ba ainihin labarin ba, ko ta yaya.
I recommend this book to everyone.	Ina ba da shawarar wannan littafin ga kowa da kowa.
A panic set in on the sidewalk.	Wani tsoro ya tsaya a bakin hanya.
I recognized her.	Na gane ta.
She thought she was going to die.	Ta yi tunanin tabbas za ta mutu.
I feel now.	Ina ji yanzu.
There is no way that it will work for everyone.	Babu wata hanya da za ta yi aiki mafi kyau ga kowa.
But it was so real.	Amma ya kasance haka sosai.
God loves the world.	Allah yana son duniya.
We have to show that.	Dole ne mu nuna hakan.
The method is incorrect.	Hanyar ba daidai ba ce.
Everyone says so.	Kowa ya ce haka.
It's something I'm used to.	Wani abu ne da na saba.
It can happen here.	Yana iya faruwa a nan.
As always late.	Kamar kullum ta makara.
I am weak to it all.	Ni mai rauni gare shi duka.
I wouldn’t expect this trip on anyone.	Ba zan yi fatan wannan tafiya a kan kowa ba.
It turns out she also loves him.	Ya bayyana ita ma tana son shi.
That is why it is here.	Shi yasa yake nan.
Then she stopped.	Sai ta tsaya.
He was not at all surprised.	Ko kadan bai yi mamaki ba.
He is a very good man.	Mutum ne mai kyau sosai.
This is quick and easy.	Wannan yana da sauri da sauƙi.
You can do it all at once.	Kuna iya yin shi duka a lokaci guda.
It will work too.	Ita ma za ta yi aiki.
The method we used is simpler.	Hanyar da muka yi amfani da ita ta fi sauƙi.
We will play again next year.	Za mu sake buga wasa shekara mai zuwa.
I must say we were very happy.	Dole ne in ce mun yi farin ciki sosai.
Or maybe this is.	Ko watakila wannan shi ne.
He was like a child again.	Ya zama kamar yaro kuma.
But he plays fast.	Amma yana wasa da sauri.
She would not let them do that to her.	Ba za ta bari su yi mata haka ba.
Do this twice a day.	Yi haka sau biyu a rana.
Or maybe she can.	Ko watakila ta iya.
Of the person who decides to live.	Na mutumin da ya yanke shawarar rayuwa.
Please speak slowly.	Da fatan za a yi magana a hankali.
Years passed.	Shekaru sun wuce.
Not just one person.	Ba mutum daya ba.
Have a good time.	Samun lokaci mai kyau.
But that will work.	Amma wannan zai yi aiki.
So it went for a while.	Haka ya tafi na ɗan lokaci.
I hate this about myself.	Na ƙi wannan game da kaina.
It will take some time.	Zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci.
I have had great success so far.	Na samu babban nasara ya zuwa yanzu.
I will be hurt.	Zan ji rauni.
They pay in it.	Suna biya a ciki.
Could it be?	Ana iya zama?
It will never work.	Ba zai taɓa yin aiki ba.
Just tell me.	Kawai gaya mani.
I have nothing to do, really.	Ba ni da wani abin da zan yi, da gaske.
So she knew he had taken it.	Don haka ta san ya dauka.
I enjoyed writing this article, finding out what happens every week.	Na ji daɗin rubuta wannan labarin, gano abin da ke faruwa kowane mako.
He was later arrested by police.	Daga baya ‘yan sanda sun kama shi.
This is the simplest answer.	Wannan amsa ce mafi sauƙi.
Let me try.	Bari in gwada.
But you get started.	Amma ka fara fara.
I want to run	Ina so in gudu
Lots of it.	Da yawa daga ciki.
She had to say something.	Sai da ta ce wani abu.
This is something that is happening.	Wannan abu ne da ke faruwa.
I want to go there, she said.	Ina so in je can, in ji ta.
So it seems that this can only work.	Don haka yana da alama cewa wannan zai iya aiki kawai.
How close is not guaranteed.	Yaya kusa ba tabbas.
You protect me, don't you?	Za ka kare ni, ko ba haka ba?
He did it himself, since he was a child.	Ya yi da kansa, tun yana yaro.
We can't focus all the time.	Ba za mu iya mai da hankali kowane lokaci ba.
I can't do anything about it.	Ba zan iya yin komai game da ita ba.
Of course I would recommend !.	Tabbas zan ba da shawarar!.
She was not like the others.	Ba ta kasance kamar sauran ba.
This appears to be correct.	Wannan ya bayyana daidai.
He was ready, and he could.	Ya shirya, kuma ya iya.
I don't have to go inside.	Ba sai na shiga ciki ba.
She did just that.	Ta yi hakan sosai.
He was not arrested that night.	Ba a kama shi a daren ba.
Do what you want.	Yi abin da kuke so.
It’s not something they’ve done in the past.	Ba wani abu ne da suka yi a baya ba.
That doesn't really happen.	Hakan baya faruwa sosai.
He needs to talk one way or another.	Yana buƙatar magana ta wata hanya ko wata.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
We talk without saying anything.	Muna magana ba tare da cewa komai ba.
But don’t worry about the name.	Amma kada ku damu da sunan.
But many do not understand.	Amma da yawa ba su gane ba.
Despite this, we will never really talk.	Duk da wannan, ba za mu taɓa yin magana ba sosai.
But that thought did not help her now.	Amma wannan tunanin bai taimaka mata ba a yanzu.
There may be someone else.	Ana iya samun wani.
For something as simple as that.	Don wani abu mai sauƙi kamar wannan.
You do not know because it is a collision.	Ba ku sani ba saboda karo ne.
You must tell me what your plan is.	Dole ne ku gaya mani menene shirin ku.
Enjoy these delicious treats.	Ji daɗin waɗannan jin daɗi masu daɗi.
There are so many of us.	Akwai mu da yawa.
You have a feeling.	Kuna da ji.
He did not do it again.	Bai kara yi ba.
I could not believe it, but she was right.	Na kasa yarda, amma ta yi gaskiya.
I finished.	Na gama.
They have two children.	Suna da yara biyu.
But you seem to know that.	Amma kamar kun san haka.
And he continues to do so today.	Kuma yana ci gaba da yin haka a yau.
It’s cool here, and you’ll feel more comfortable inside.	Yana da sanyi a nan, kuma za ku fi jin daɗi a ciki.
He wanted to accept it.	Ya so ya yarda da ita.
It's a trip.	Tafiya ce.
He forgot, but he will surely remember.	Ya manta, amma tabbas zai tuna.
I, of course, was concerned about that.	Ni, ba shakka, na damu da hakan.
I do not understand.	Ban gane ba.
I recommend you do the following.	Ina ba da shawarar ku yi waɗannan abubuwan.
I was very happy, though.	Na yi farin ciki sosai, ko da yake.
It can not be.	Ba za a iya zama ba.
There is no interest in you, of course, but.	Babu wani sha'awa a gare ku, ba shakka, amma .
I will not miss what I have to go.	Ba zan rasa abin da zan je ba.
I will try this next time.	Zan gwada hakan lokaci na gaba.
I think you should start there.	Ina ganin sai ka fara can.
And it was not done.	Kuma ba a yi ba.
It may seem like a new idea, but it really isn't.	Wataƙila ya zama kamar sabon tunani, amma da gaske ba haka ba ne.
The doctor examined him carefully.	Likitan ya duba shi da kyau.
They did something better.	Sun yi wani abu mafi kyau.
He just needs to get the game there.	Ya kawai bukatar samun wasan a can.
Looks like they weren't made.	Kamar ba a yi su ba.
I tell you this.	Ina gaya muku wannan.
You cannot know who the player is by the way they look.	Ba za ku iya sanin wanene ɗan wasa ba ta yadda suke kama.
It serves him right.	Yayi masa kyau.
It is better to arrange payment.	Gara a shirya biya.
The world they live in.	Duniya da suka zauna a ciki.
But he did not explain the book.	Amma bai bayyana littafin ba.
But not near.	Amma ba kusa ba.
It is written.	An rubuta.
We succeeded, of course.	Mun yi nasara ba shakka.
We must continue to work.	Dole ne mu ci gaba da aiki.
Fortunately, it was time to move on.	Abin farin ciki, lokaci ya yi da za a tafi.
After he left she sat down next to the house.	Bayan ya fita ta zauna kusa da gidan.
Remember the game.	Tuna wasan.
Hardly fit.	Da wuya ya dace.
I do not know how this can happen.	Ban san yadda hakan zai iya faruwa ba.
And work is work.	Kuma aiki aiki ne.
So, make sure you know yourself by it.	Don haka, tabbatar da cewa kun san kanku da shi.
As you were.	Kamar yadda kuka kasance.
It looks very much like you.	Yana kama da ku sosai.
He laughed.	Sai yayi dariya.
I think we will see what happens.	Ina tsammanin za mu ga abin da ya faru.
To show the person, to appear.	Don nuna kan mutum, don bayyana.
What kind of person is he?	Wane irin mutum ne shi?
Life is Beautiful!	Rai na da kyau!
But look at it.	Amma duba shi.
They have a cold season, with a lot of cold.	Suna da lokacin sanyi, tare da yawan sanyi.
I hope she doesn't do that.	Ina fatan ba za ta yi hakan ba.
And don't worry.	Kuma kada ku damu.
When he said he would take the food to heaven.	Lokacin da ya ce zai kai abincin sama.
A second attempt.	Ƙarin ƙoƙari na biyu.
When the heat was off, he decided to stay.	Da zafi ya kashe, sai ya yanke shawarar ya zauna.
Maybe more than that.	Watakila fiye da haka.
He was told that they were nearby.	Aka gaya masa cewa suna nan kusa.
Even if people do not believe me it is true.	Ko da mutane ba su yarda da ni ba gaskiya ne.
However, we played the game anyway.	Duk da haka, mun yi wasan duk da haka.
It seems like everyone is doing the same thing.	Da alama kowa yana yin abu ɗaya.
He is looking for a woman.	Yana neman mata.
Everyone loves it.	Kowa ya so shi.
The problem is one of the users.	Matsalar tana ɗaya daga cikin masu amfani.
Right, you say.	Dama, ka ce.
It is already closed for the day.	Ya riga ya rufe don ranar.
Of course he did not know me.	Tabbas bai san ni ba.
I did not get a chance to travel.	Ban sami damar yin tafiya ba.
But listen, this is nothing.	Amma ji, wannan ba komai ba ne.
We say that what is lost can be gained.	Muna cewa abin da aka rasa za a iya samu.
We are interested in them, or interested in them.	Muna sha'awar su, ko kuma sha'awar su.
It became very interesting to me.	Ya zama mai ban sha'awa a gare ni.
The right thing to do.	Abin da ya dace ya yi.
They are better.	Sun fi kyau.
Get in there.	Shiga can.
This is nothing here.	Wannan ba komai ba ne a nan.
It hurts me.	Ya yi min.
For sure.	Don tabbas.
And it's good.	Kuma yayi kyau.
It does a great job and is fast.	Yana yin babban aiki kuma yana da sauri.
But the person wants to go out and get more somehow.	Amma mutumin yana so ya fita ya sami ƙarin ko ta yaya.
Then she went and did it again.	Sai ta je ta sake yi.
I decided to enter the house.	Na yanke shawarar shiga gidan.
Where others are lost.	Inda wasu ke bata.
It is open to everyone.	Ya bude ma kowa komai.
Of course you see what he does for us.	Tabbas kuma kun ga me yake yi mana.
She has to get out.	Dole ta fita.
I can't do without it.	Ba zan iya yi ba tare da shi ba.
Maybe they didn’t.	Wataƙila ba su yi ba.
Almost a month.	Kusan wata daya.
When he returned, she left.	Bayan ya dawo ta tafi.
Two more nights.	Dare biyu kuma.
I grew up playing with it.	Na girma ina wasa da shi.
But there is more to come.	Amma akwai sauran abubuwa masu zuwa.
I think he needs help.	Ina tsammanin yana bukatar taimako.
There is so much to do.	An yi abubuwa da yawa da za a yi.
I could not be here when they came.	Ba zan iya zama a nan ba lokacin da suka zo.
He knew he was giving her access to everything.	Ya san yana ba ta dama ga komai.
You may wonder why this is so.	Wataƙila kuna mamakin dalilin da ya sa hakan ya faru.
The station was closed at night.	An rufe tashar da dare.
He was very curious.	Ya kasance mai son sani sosai.
This is actually a real place.	A gaskiya wannan wuri ne na gaske.
There is no one in the world.	Babu kowa a duniya.
Of course, we cannot know when he rose.	Tabbas, ba za mu iya sanin lokacin da ya tashi ba.
She has three children.	Tana da yaya uku.
He’s not doing anything here, though.	Ba ya yin komai a nan, duk da haka.
But here there is a bigger problem.	Amma a nan akwai matsala mafi girma.
They were amazing.	Sun yi ban mamaki.
I have never heard you cry.	Ban taba jin kuka kuka ba.
It's 'me' doing it.	Yana 'ni' yin shi.
Hopefully it will be better than the last.	Da fatan zai fi na ƙarshe.
Read this opportunity.	Karanta wannan dama.
Keep reading it.	Ci gaba da karanta shi.
She has always been for us.	Ta kasance a gare mu koyaushe.
He knows that.	Ya san haka.
That's why he came back.	Shi yasa ya dawo.
I don’t hate it or like it.	Ba na ƙi shi ko son shi.
Not as cold as she expected.	Ba sanyi kamar yadda ta zata.
He will give you everything he has.	Zai ba ku duk abin da yake da shi.
It is a statement of truth.	Magana ce ta gaskiya.
They are all there.	Duk suna wurin.
So we waited.	Sai muka jira.
Maybe that can work.	Wataƙila hakan na iya yin aiki.
I do two things.	Ina yin abubuwa biyu.
One meal, please.	Abinci daya, don Allah.
No, just.	A'a, kawai .
Hope to have dinner.	Da fatan za a gama abincin dare.
I am not needed here.	Ba a buƙatar ni a nan.
But we can do more than that.	Amma za mu iya yin abin da ya fi wannan labarin.
He looked, he waited.	Ya duba, ya jira.
It is very well prepared and very well done.	An shirya sosai kuma yayi kyau sosai.
No one did.	Babu wanda ya yi.
The employer rejected this request.	Mai aiki ya ƙi wannan buƙatar.
Removed	An cire
I know that is not easy.	Na san hakan ba shi da sauƙi.
I am not right.	Ni ba gaskiya ba ne.
He is not very well.	Ba shi da lafiya sosai.
But he did not do any of these.	Amma bai yi ko ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan ba.
He went to see.	Ya tafi ma ya gani.
A person who has never made a mistake has never tried something new.	Mutumin da bai yi kuskure ba bai taɓa gwada sabon abu ba.
They think they will be heard so there is a lot of talk.	Suna tsammanin za a ji su don haka ana magana da yawa.
You can never get a job again.	Ba za ku iya sake samun aiki ba.
Of course there may be others.	Tabbas za a iya samun wasu.
But everything is fine, everything is fine.	Amma komai yayi kyau, komai yayi kyau.
Everyone except her.	Kowa sai ita.
Maybe she's interested.	Wataƙila tana sha'awar.
One thought is good.	Tunanin guda ɗaya yayi kyau.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu wani abu da ya wuce haka.
I got up to work.	Na tashi aiki.
And, now, something amazing is happening.	Kuma, yanzu, wani abu mai ban sha'awa ya fara faruwa.
He wonders where she is tonight.	Yayi mamakin inda take a daren nan.
As she said earlier ‘progress is progress’.	Kamar yadda ta fada a baya 'ci gaba shine ci gaba'.
It is good that you want to help me.	Yana da kyau ka so ka taimake ni.
And she wants to show what she got.	Kuma tana son nuna abin da ta samu.
But this is very good.	Amma wannan yana da kyau sosai.
I do not know how long this will be.	Ban san tsawon lokacin da wannan zai kasance ba.
Make sure the user is working fine.	Tabbatar da mai amfani yana aiki lafiya.
I could not remember the joy.	Na kasa tuna farin ciki.
I wonder if he did that to other people?	Na yi tunanin ko ya yi haka da wasu mutane?
Maybe they were there.	Wataƙila sun kasance a wurin.
Anyway.	Ta wata hanya.
I know what you can.	Na san abin da za ku iya.
That is what they are after.	Abin da suke bayan kenan.
I doubt they are on it.	Ina shakka ko suna kan ta.
If he is interested, he can get it.	Idan yana sha'awar, zai iya samun ta.
Put it on.	Saka ta.
They did.	Haka suka yi.
What can be said about this song?	Me za a iya cewa game da wannan waƙa?
He saved the day.	Ya ajiye ranar.
I'm not sure.	Lallai ban tabbata ba.
I want to test them thoroughly.	Ina so in gwada su sosai.
Either way, maybe this will make you feel better.	Ko ta yaya, watakila wannan zai sa ka ji daɗi.
It feels good.	Ya ji dadi.
Talk to people.	Magana da mutane.
I can tell you well.	Zan iya gaya muku da kyau.
But your experiences will be unforgettable.	Amma abubuwan da kuka samu za su kasance ba za a manta da su ba.
And people must be arrested.	Kuma dole ne a kama mutane.
But then he left.	Amma sai ya tafi.
From one day.	Daga kwana guda.
I look at you.	Na kallon ku.
They will finish what they started.	Za su gama abin da suka fara.
Maybe he was hurt.	Wataƙila ya ji rauni.
But at first nothing went right.	Amma daga farko babu abin da ya tafi daidai.
Just because they didn't do us any good.	Don kawai ba su yi mana wani amfani ba.
And inside, there.	Kuma a ciki, akwai .
Maybe that's what she wants.	Watakila abin da take so ne.
It is enough to remarry.	Ya isa ya kara aure.
It came out well.	Ya fito da kyau.
She decided to go to the party.	Ta yanke shawarar za ta je bikin.
We should have called him yesterday.	Da ma mun kira shi jiya.
However, arrests were made.	Duk da haka, an sami kama.
I think it was a little cold today.	Ina tsammanin ya ɗan yi sanyi a yau.
No one is here.	Babu kowa a nan.
Now we are doing everything together.	Yanzu muna yin komai tare.
That should be sufficient enough.	Wannan ya isa.
Tell me the whole story.	Bani labarin duka.
This may take some time, a week or more.	Wannan na iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci, mako ko fiye.
Watching that is hard.	Kallon shi ke da wuya.
Buy It Now!.	Saya shi yanzu!.
I will be close to you.	Zan kasance kusa da ku.
Life is a game for those who seek it.	Rayuwa wasa ce ga masu neman ta.
This is a really international project.	Wannan aiki ne na kasa da kasa da gaske.
I began to wonder.	Na fara mamaki.
What is happening is really coming to him.	Abin da ke faruwa yana zuwa gare shi da gaske.
That's all right.	Wannan duk daidai yake.
It lets you think of going again with you.	Kuna barin ku tunanin sake tafiya tare da ku.
Work can wait.	Aiki na iya jira.
Check this twice a day.	Duba wannan sau biyu a rana.
I’m just about who ever did.	Ni kawai game da wanda ya taɓa yi.
I am one of these.	Ina ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan.
She was told it had happened.	Aka gaya mata ya faru.
I walk this way.	Ina tafiya ta wannan hanya.
Everything you edited is good for me.	Duk abin da kuka gyara yana da kyau a gare ni.
I wrote to tell him so.	Na rubuta don gaya masa haka.
Let me put this to you nicely.	Bari in sanya muku wannan da kyau.
What we need is more effort.	Abin da muke bukata shine ƙarin ƙoƙari.
A lot of good.	Mai kyau mai yawa.
I tried it, it works fine.	Na gwada shi, yana aiki lafiya.
I want to know for sure.	Ina so in sani tabbas.
He did a good job with it.	Ya yi kyakkyawan aiki da shi.
And, well, you know me.	Kuma, da kyau, kun san ni.
They never have.	Ba su taba da.
He loves to laugh.	Yana son dariya.
Everything will help.	Komai zai taimaka.
At least I didn't understand that.	Ko kadan ban gane hakan ba.
He recognized me.	Ya gane ni.
Some people are not many.	Wasu mutane ba su da yawa.
I know we got their best game today.	Na san cewa mun sami mafi kyawun wasan su a yau.
Why it does not appear.	Dalilin da ya sa ba ya bayyana.
How things have changed.	Yadda abubuwa suka canza.
This is amazing.	Wannan abin ban mamaki ne.
I feel fine.	Ina jin lafiya.
I have done the same thing before, it worked well.	Na yi irin wannan abu a baya, ya yi aiki da kyau.
Which made me think more.	Abin da ya sa na kara tunani.
They want to know how to get out of a trip.	Suna so su san yadda za su iya fita daga tafiya.
Do you feel coming?	Kuna jin zuwa?.
I love you	Ina son ku
It feels to me the latter.	Yana ji a gare ni na karshen.
I have to finish this early.	Dole ne in gama wannan da wuri.
And that's what this is all about.	Kuma abin da wannan yake game da shi ke nan.
So the man won.	Don haka mutumin ya ci nasara.
I am not that person.	Ni ba wannan mutumin ba ne.
I remember fighting him.	Na tuna fada da shi.
What is not known is the big deal.	Abin da ba a sani ba shine babban abu.
He got up.	Ya tashi.
These feelings are real.	Waɗannan ji na gaske ne.
I will not come here in the morning.	Ba zan zo nan da safe ba.
The world is not alone.	Duniya ba kawai ba ce.
I did not think of anything at the time.	Ban yi tunanin komai ba a lokacin.
Just let me think.	Kawai bari in yi tunani.
No one is around.	Babu kowa a kusa.
You can not read for this.	Ba za ku iya yin karatu don wannan ba.
This is the right time and place.	Wannan shi ne daidai lokaci da wuri.
Learn to laugh.	Koyi dariya.
How does this make you feel?	Yaya wannan ya sa ku ji?.
But that is not too much.	Amma hakan bai yi yawa ba.
We do not have time for that now.	Ba mu da lokacin hakan a yanzu.
About the night at the restaurant, please do not.	Game da daren a gidan abinci, don Allah kar a yi.
And they know about me.	Kuma sun san game da ni.
I was surprised.	Na yi mamaki.
It is better to be safe and patient.	Gara a zauna lafiya da hakuri.
We must get up early.	Dole ne mu tashi da wuri.
What you just heard I heard.	Abin da kuka ji kawai na ji.
Off you go.	Kashe ka tafi.
Just make sure you do not do it all at once.	Kawai ka tabbata kada ka yi shi a lokaci guda.
And how she wants to be there.	Da kuma yadda take son zama a can.
I said marry me.	Na ce ka aure ni.
I'm still there.	Har yanzu ina can.
We got up and continued walking.	Muka tashi muka ci gaba da tafiya.
Exactly as it happened.	Daidai kamar yadda ya faru.
This works well.	Wannan yana aiki da kyau.
This makes people stop going out.	Hakan yana sa mutane su daina fita waje.
We must first catch them.	Dole ne mu fara kama su.
No one knows where he is.	Babu wanda ya san inda yake.
I was never happy.	Ban taba farin ciki ba.
It started to work.	Ya fara aiki.
Anyone else remember it ?.	Wani kuma ya tuna da shi?.
It will help you.	Zai taimake ku.
It is also hot.	Yana kuma zafi.
We did a good job of removing it.	Mun yi kyakkyawan aiki na cire shi.
Few are successful.	Kadan ne masu nasara.
Or they were.	Ko kuma sun kasance.
Maybe it would be better if he could sleep.	Wataƙila ya fi kyau idan zai iya barci.
It is unhealthy and wrong.	Ba shi da lafiya kuma ba daidai ba ne.
My children are not well.	Yara na ba lafiya.
And you do not know.	Kuma ba ku sani ba.
God! 	Allah!
It does exactly that, too.	Yana yin daidai daidai abin, kuma.
We got everything right.	Mun sami komai mai kyau.
At school she ate lunch alone.	A makaranta ita kadai ta ci abincin rana.
I cut it.	Na yanke shi.
Someone must join.	Dole ne wani ya shiga.
He wants to buy them.	Yana so ya saya su.
But later she spoke to someone else.	Amma daga baya ta yi magana da wani.
Never eaten.	Ba a taɓa cin abinci ba.
If he just took it, he would go faster.	Idan kawai ya dauka, zai yi sauri.
And what you tell me.	Da abin da kuke gaya mani.
They, too, did not get much.	Su ma ba su samu da yawa ba.
The problem started with him.	Matsalar ta fara da shi.
But many are many.	Amma da yawa suna da yawa.
It’s weird sometimes.	Abu ne mai ban mamaki wani lokacin.
Why, we can do anything.	Me ya sa, za mu iya yin komai.
Now we have succeeded.	Yanzu mun yi nasara.
He is the best for everyone.	Shi ne mafi kyau ga kowa da kowa.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
We did the wrong thing.	Mun yi abin da bai dace ba.
We must get help.	Dole ne mu sami taimako.
I feel sure.	Na ji tabbas.
We still do not know her true identity.	Har yanzu ba mu san ainihin ainihin ta ba.
We are right.	Muna daidai.
Everyone did the same.	Haka kowa yayi.
Before you go.	Kafin ka tafi .
Yet they did.	Amma duk da haka sun shiga.
The crowd is tired.	Taron ya gaji.
The man stopped.	Mutumin ya tsaya.
You feel comfortable and your home is comfortable.	Kuna jin daɗi kuma gidan ku yana jin daɗi.
I think here.	Ina tunani a nan.
But he is not alone.	Amma ba shi kadai ba.
It is not very difficult.	Ba shi da wahala sosai.
They were like him.	Sun kasance kamar shi.
It's inside.	Yana ciki.
I tried it at work and it was not there, so.	Na gwada ta a wurin aiki kuma ba ta nan, don haka.
And, ask me.	Kuma, tambaye ni.
The same goes for everyone.	Haka ma kowa.
If you are scared, do not watch the final game.	Idan kuna jin tsoro, kar ku kalli wasan ƙarshe.
He laughed.	Yayi dariya.
It is something we are very concerned about.	Wani abu ne da muka damu sosai.
I did not think so.	Ban yi tunanin haka ba.
I'll leave it at that.	Zan bar shi a haka.
You know how it was.	Kun san yadda hakan ya kasance.
I asked her what she was going to do.	Na tambaye ta me za ta yi.
They just don’t.	Ba kawai suke yi ba.
Of course it is good to be both.	Tabbas yana da kyau ku kasance duka.
Boy everyone is surprised.	Yaro kowa yayi mamaki.
We are just scared.	Muna jin tsoro ne kawai.
You should tell her so.	Ya kamata ka gaya mata haka.
I did what was necessary.	Na yi abin da ya zama dole.
I still have no answer.	Ba ni da amsa har yanzu.
I see and understand what you write.	Ina gani kuma na gane abin da ka rubuta.
We have to keep going.	Dole ne mu ci gaba.
They started.	Sun fara.
And this is something that needs to be understood.	Kuma wannan shi ne abin da ya kamata a gane.
I hope he enjoys it a little.	Ina fatan ya dan yi masa dadi.
Not to be outdone.	Ba abin jira a ce shi ba.
What time do you think you are going there?	Wani lokaci kuke tunanin zuwa can?.
He just doesn't feel well.	Kawai ba ya jin lafiya sosai.
What is to be done.	Menene abin da dole ne a yi.
If they want to get something out of it, they can.	Idan suna son samun wani abu daga gare shi, za su iya.
The only thing we can know is that the story must continue.	Abin da kawai za mu iya sani shi ne cewa dole ne labarin ya ci gaba.
You can fix this.	Kuna iya gyara wannan.
I can show her.	Zan iya nuna mata.
But it is better.	Amma ya fi kyau.
I do not know how long.	Ban san tsawon yaushe ba.
It may take some time, of course.	Yana iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan, ba shakka.
They smoke.	Suna shan taba.
This is the second best thing.	Wannan shine abu na biyu mafi kyau.
She thought it would hurt.	Ta dauka zai yi zafi.
I killed him.	Na kashe shi.
Hurry up about it.	Yi sauri game da shi.
No one arrested him.	Babu wanda ya kama shi.
It is not difficult for me.	Ba wuya a gare ni ba.
Tell him what he needs to do.	Ka gaya masa abin da yake bukata ya yi.
He felt right for us.	Ya ji mana daidai.
I made a second enough.	Na yi isa na biyu.
He brought them two or three times.	Ya kawo su sau biyu ko uku.
The first game of the game was for me.	Wasan farko na wasan shine a gare ni.
The police will be called.	Za a kira 'yan sanda.
He is a wonderful man.	Mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
I said fix the water.	Na ce gyara ruwan.
And it should not come from you.	Kuma bai kamata ya fito daga gare ku ba.
To swim faster.	Don yin iyo da sauri.
Are they serious?	Da gaske suke?.
The house is empty.	Gidan babu kowa.
I am very honest.	Ina gaskiya sosai.
Some do not realize that today is happening.	Wasu ba su gane cewa yau na faruwa ba.
And by the way she was right.	Kuma ta hanyar da ta yi gaskiya.
I feel cold inside and everything.	Ina jin sanyi a ciki da komai.
He immediately found out why.	Nan da nan ya gano dalilin.
Not much of that.	Ba dama da yawa na hakan.
I can find them.	Zan iya samun su.
He could not do that.	Ya kasa yin haka.
In fact, it is difficult.	A gaskiya ma, yana da wuya.
We never got this.	Ba mu taɓa samun wannan ba.
Why did she save it? 	Me yasa ta ajiye shi?
She was surprised.	Ta yi mamaki.
The project requires a great deal of focus.	Aikin yana buƙatar mai da hankali sosai.
After all, you are the only one.	Bayan haka, kai ne kawai.
But, it happened.	Amma, faru ya yi.
They may have a week.	Suna iya samun mako guda.
We all know the truth, though.	Mu duka mun san gaskiya, ko da yake.
He knows what kind of call he got.	Ya san wane irin kira ya samu amsa haka.
It's all there, now.	Duk yana nan, yanzu.
And do it again.	Kuma sake yi.
You learn quickly.	Kuna koyi da sauri.
I felt completely covered.	Na ji a rufe gaba daya.
He did not answer.	Bai amsa ba.
Meals are being prepared.	Ana shirya abincin.
This will be one day.	Wannan zai zama kwana ɗaya.
This is a great help.	Wannan babban taimako ne.
I'm the only one being beaten.	Kawai ita ake yi min duka.
They cannot find out where he went.	Ba za su iya gano inda ya tafi ba.
It will not be missed.	Ba za a rasa shi ba.
You are right.	Kai ta gaskiya.
The first way.	Hanya ta farko.
They told me not to tell anyone, not even one soul.	Sai suka ce mini kada in gaya wa kowa, ko rai guda.
They have it there.	Suna da shi a can.
To stay safe.	Don a zauna lafiya.
I have the best time.	Ina da lokacin mafi kyau.
We walk slowly.	Muna tafiya a hankali.
After all, they are the ones who eat and work.	Bayan haka, su ne suke ci da aiki.
I'll think about it.	Zan yi tunanin shi.
Maybe they didn’t even get it tomorrow.	Watakila ma ba su samu gobe ba.
He doesn't want anything to happen tonight.	Ba ya son wani abu ya faru a daren nan.
We can fix it.	Za mu iya gyara shi.
She is doing very well.	Tana yin kyau sosai.
Hopefully that will suffice.	Da fatan hakan ya isa.
She left.	Ta tafi.
I want to help.	Ina so in taimaka.
You did not know what you wanted in the first place.	Ba ku san abin da kuke so ba tun farko.
Progress and progress have been slow, at best.	Ci gaba da ci gaba sun kasance a hankali, a mafi kyau.
First, she realized immediately.	Na farko, ta gane nan take.
As someone said, it is not.	Kamar yadda wani ya ce, ba haka ba ne.
I won't even eat.	Ba zan ma ci ba.
They believed in me.	Sun ba da gaskiya gare ni.
He saw the boy become a god.	Ya ga yaro ya zama allah.
We have all seen what is going to happen to you.	Mu duka mun ga abin da ke shirin faruwa da ku.
She writes to him that she knows he is coming.	Ta rubuta masa cewa ta san yana zuwa.
It will be done somewhere, at some point.	Za a yi wani wuri, a wani lokaci.
They have to take it.	Dole ne su ɗauka.
I remember he was talking to you.	Na tuna yana magana da ku.
When they can fish.	Lokacin da za su iya kifi.
We do not need to do that here.	Ba mu bukatar yin haka a nan.
It will take some time.	Zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
I think we missed it.	Ina tsammanin mun rasa shi.
He thought she must be happy.	Ya dauka tabbas tana jin dadi.
We talk two or three times a month.	Muna magana sau biyu ko uku a wata.
If they are, it gives them ease.	Idan sun kasance, yana ba su sauƙi.
We killed	Mun kashe
But he wants you to understand that.	Amma yana son ku fahimci wannan.
They lied to me.	Sun yi min karya.
Many wanted to know what he had to say.	Mutane da yawa sun so su san abin da zai ce.
She looked like everyone else.	Ta yi kama da kowa.
In the morning they will speak again.	Da safe za su ƙara yin magana.
Great.	Babban.
The length of the two cars was in the back.	Tsawon mota biyu suka yi a baya.
I love everything you do.	Ina son duk abin da kuke yi.
I wanted it to happen.	Na so ya faru.
You may agree that they must.	Kuna iya yarda cewa tabbas suna.
This house has been uninhabited for years.	Wannan gidan ya kasance babu kowa tsawon shekaru.
You can find me, or not.	Kuna iya samun ni, ko a'a.
Make no mistake about it.	Kar ku kuskure ni.
I hope to enjoy you again.	Zan yi fatan in sake jin daɗin ku.
A noise filled the room.	Wata kara ce ta cika dakin.
It can bring a lot of joy and warmth.	Yana iya kawo farin ciki da zafi sosai.
It’s good to look at things.	Yana da kyau a kalli abubuwa.
No one else can.	Ba wanda kuma zai iya.
It's been three years.	Shekara uku ne ya gama.
He needs me.	Yana bukata na.
You’re good at things like that.	Kuna da kyau a abubuwa kamar haka.
She wanted the driver to stop.	Ta so mai motar ya tsaya.
She has been doing this for a long time.	Ta dade da yin hakan.
Now you understand that.	Yanzu kun fahimci hakan.
She could not know what she had done.	Ba za ta iya sanin abin da ta yi ba.
Fear is not in them.	Tsoro ba ya cikin su.
But that's not all.	Amma wannan ba duka ba ne.
There is no way you can go beyond that.	Babu yadda za ku iya wuce wannan.
You agree she is dead.	Kun yarda ta mutu.
It's a pleasure.	Abin farin ciki ne.
You will be happy.	Za ku ji daɗi.
He thought he would be here for a while.	Ya yi tsammanin zai kasance a nan na ɗan lokaci.
Remember, there is already someone doing this.	Ka tuna, an riga an sami mai yin wannan.
Good job for you.	Yayi kyau aiki a gare ku.
The door is a little open.	Kofar a bude take kadan.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
She had no problem.	Ba ta sami matsala ba.
Try to close your home.	Yi ƙoƙarin rufe gidan ku.
That made me laugh.	Abin da ya bani dariya kenan.
They are very cold.	Sun yi sanyi sosai.
No one will marry us.	Babu wanda zai aure mu.
The speaker cannot speak.	Mai magana ba ya iya magana.
Is she gone?	Ta tafi?
And he does not send.	Kuma ba ya aika.
And it is difficult to achieve that.	Kuma yana da wuya a yi nasara haka.
About a year before he responded.	Kamar shekara guda kafin ya amsa.
You can carry this item wherever it wants to go.	Kuna iya ɗaukar wannan abu a duk inda yake son zuwa.
It has always been about you.	Ya kasance game da ku koyaushe.
We saw the kids at the party	Mun ga yara a wurin bikin
You will do well.	Za ku yi kyau.
Women know.	Mata sun sani.
It doesn’t look like it’s scary or anything.	Ba kamar yana da ban tsoro ko wani abu ba.
You changed the oil.	Ka canza mai.
Laughter is dead.	Dariya ta mutu.
He will too.	Shi ma zai yi.
Ya ku ?.	Ya ku?.
So, we started with that.	Don haka, mun fara da cewa.
I read this daily now and it is hard to believe.	Na karanta wannan kullum a yanzu kuma yana da wuya a yarda.
And he bought me a cup of coffee.	Kuma ya saya mini kofi.
We can talk about it.	Za mu iya magana game da shi.
That's what he's going to do.	Abin da zai yi ke nan.
So never say no !.	Don haka kar a ce taba!.
Very, very nice.	Sosai, da kyau sosai.
All this for her, of course.	Duk wannan ya kasance a gare ta, tabbas.
Be careful when breaking it!	Yi hankali lokacin karya shi!
See who they are working for.	Kalli wanda suke yi wa aiki.
Thirty is a good meal.	Talatin shine kyakkyawan ci.
This is a fact you must accept.	Wannan gaskiya ce ku yarda da ita.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.	Ba daidai ba, kuskure, kuskure.
That is not true.	Hakan ba gaskiya ba ne.
That's all we can do.	Abin da za mu iya yi ke nan.
I decided to go on the weekend.	Na yanke shawarar mu tafi karshen mako.
Read more in this article.	Karanta ƙarin wannan labarin.
He was a good boy.	Ya kasance kyakkyawan yaro.
Their car was amazing.	Motar su ta yi ban mamaki.
But nothing could be further from the truth.	Amma babu abin da ya wuce haka.
He does not talk much.	Ba ya yawan magana.
They know better.	Sun fi sani.
Maybe together we can find out.	Wataƙila tare za mu iya gano wannan abu.
It's about comfort.	Yana da game da jin dadi.
They talked for a long time.	Sun dade suna magana.
Apart from this, it can fly.	Baya ga wannan, zai iya tashi.
That is why she will not do it.	Shi ya sa ba za ta yi ba.
So, that made me think.	Don haka, hakan ya sa na yi tunani.
Looking for someone.	Neman wani.
It gets me all the time.	Yana samun ni kowane lokaci.
I did not know any of this at the time.	Ban san ko ɗaya daga cikin wannan ba a lokacin.
Seriously, we need to call someone about that.	Da gaske, muna bukatar mu kira wani game da wannan.
There is little water	Ana samun ruwa kaɗan
But you will love it.	Amma za ku so shi.
Getting lost happened.	Samun bata ya faru.
That feels good.	Wannan yana jin dadi.
Must be paid in advance.	Dole ne a biya a gaba.
He will definitely study well.	Tabbas tabbas zai yi karatu mai kyau.
Not at all.	Ba gaba daya ba.
I want to do it that way.	Ina so in yi ta irin wannan hanya.
Some of the work was simple.	Wasu daga cikin aikin ya kasance mai sauƙi.
Whoever lost.	Wanda duk ya rasa.
Although both are equally common.	Ko da yake duka biyu sun yi daidai da yawa.
Kind of like that too.	Irin son wannan kuma.
No bad feelings about the purchase.	Babu mummunan ji game da siyan.
He showed me.	Ya nuna min.
I do not care about myself.	Ban damu da kaina ba.
Maybe he was honest with himself.	Wataƙila ya kasance mai gaskiya ga kansa.
I like this game.	Ina son wannan wasan.
She didn't give him anything.	Bata bashi komai ba.
Nothing can be said he can't.	Babu abin da za a ce ba zai iya ba.
He was released that day.	A ranar ne aka sake shi.
I hope that will happen soon.	Ina fatan hakan zai faru da wuri.
If people hate you, leave them alone.	Idan mutane sun ƙi ku, ku bar su.
Completely left me.	Gaba daya ya bar ni.
When you want.	Lokacin da kuke so.
It may be the last chance we get.	Yana iya zama dama ta ƙarshe da za mu samu.
Probably so.	Wataƙila haka ne.
It was then that she realized he wanted to talk.	Sai a lokacin ta gane yana son magana.
You cannot tell me where to stay and where to stay.	Ba za ku iya gaya mani inda zan zauna da inda ba zan zauna ba.
Really one person this could be.	Da gaske mutum ɗaya ne wannan zai iya zama.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Don Allah a gaya mani ba wannan ba.
We missed all of that.	Mun rasa duk wannan.
He stayed with me.	Ya zauna tare da ni.
Some kids like to play outside.	Wasu yara suna son yin wasa a waje.
Or he did not cry.	Ko kuka bai yi ba.
I do not know anything.	Ban san komai ba.
It's scary.	Abin ban tsoro ne.

Now, he is worried.	Yanzu, ya damu.
I see what you get.	Na ga abin da kuke samu.
We made a big mistake.	Mun yi kuskure sosai.
All day and most nights.	Duk rana da mafi yawan dare.
Not surprisingly.	Ba abin mamaki bane.
Good night.	Ya kwana.
This is fast.	Wannan yana da sauri.
I will pretend to be a sailor.	Zan yi kamar ni mai jirgin ruwa ne.
So do we.	Haka da mu.
He totally cared.	Gaba ɗaya ya kula.
Some are a little on board.	Wasu kadan ne a cikin jirgin.
He really wants you to do it for him.	Ainihin yana son ku yi masa.
If anyone can remove it.	Idan wani zai iya cire shi.
The look was disappointing.	Kallon ya bata rai.
It will.	Zai yi.
She often slept on the floor.	Sau da yawa ta kan kwana a kasa.
They looked at each other in thought.	Suka kalli juna cikin tunani.
I don't look at anything.	Ba na kallon komai.
We got up.	Muka tashi.
You have to learn how to eat.	Dole ne ku koyi yadda ake cin abinci.
It won't work, she said.	Ba zai yi aiki ba, in ji ta.
I got you one.	Na samu ku daya.
I love her here.	Ina son ta a nan.
They live in the moment.	Suna rayuwa a wannan lokacin.
I just want a dog.	Ina son kare kawai.
Today is a wonderful day.	Yau abin ban mamaki ne.
That did not work well.	Hakan bai yi kyau ba.
No pain.	Babu zafi.
But we still haven't reached the end of the story.	Amma har yanzu ba mu kai ga karshen labarin ba.
I never planned anything for this.	Ban taba shirya wani abu na wannan ba.
It almost seems to be true.	Da alama kusan yayi kyau ya zama gaskiya.
And probably bigger than the last one.	Kuma tabbas ya fi na ƙarshe girma.
It doesn't need one.	Baya bukatar daya.
Not all of them died.	Ba duk sun mutu ba.
Kids are interested.	Yara suna sha'awar.
The doctor closed the door slowly.	Likitan ya rufe kofar a hankali.
It just shows that they know me very well !.	Kawai ya nuna sun san ni sosai!.
She wants to save water.	Tana so ta ajiye ruwa.
I must go.	Ina so in tafi.
We should no longer make it difficult.	Bai kamata mu ƙara sanya shi da wahala ba.
Although it will not be.	Ko da yake ba zai kasance ba.
I don't want him to come.	Bana son ya zo.
Sit next to me.	Zauna kusa da ni.
He made coffee.	Ya yi kofi.
I went and told him.	Na je na fada masa.
They grow very well here though.	Suna girma sosai a nan ko da yake.
I want to go	Ina so in yi tafiya
This one person cannot do that.	Wannan mutum ɗaya ba zai iya yin haka ba.
It's really scary.	Abin tsoro na gaske.
He knew he was sick at the time.	Ya san cewa ba shi da lafiya a wannan lokacin.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
I want to play this game.	Ina son buga wannan wasan.
She knew how to do it.	Ta san yadda za ta yi.
One or two can be.	Daya ko biyu na iya zama.
That's why it started to appear.	Shi ya sa ya fara bayyana.
On the other hand, it is very strange.	A wata hanya kuma, yana da ban mamaki sosai.
Whatever he does, he is fine.	Duk abin da yake yi, yana da kyau.
How she could not do anything to fix it.	Yadda ta kasa yin komai don gyara shi.
Everything is ready.	An shirya komai.
That was interesting.	Hakan ya ban sha'awa.
If you are in a hurry.	Idan kai yayi sauri.
You know, something really good.	Ka sani, wani abu mai kyau sosai.
But it is not.	Amma ba haka ba.
It happens in the past.	Yana faruwa a baya.
And that's a good thing.	Kuma wannan abu ne mai kyau.
If he is not careful.	Idan bai yi hankali ba.
I have it.	Ina da ita.
But she did not do so.	Amma ba ta yi haka ba.
I can still.	Har yanzu ina iya.
But she felt touched.	Amma ta ji an taba.
We will see what this year will be like.	Za mu ga yadda wannan shekara za ta kasance.
The car sped off.	Motar ta tashi.
Everything is in place.	Duk abin da ke cikin wurin.
I always see this.	Ina ganin wannan koyaushe.
Learn from your past and move on.	Koyi daga abubuwan da suka gabata kuma ku ci gaba.
The same is true today.	Haka abin yake a yau.
And finally, this is probably the best development.	Kuma a ƙarshe, watakila wannan shine mafi kyawun ci gaba.
They came later.	Sun zo daga baya.
I know it's not me.	Na san ba ni ba ne.
You can do this job if you really try.	Kuna iya yin wannan aikin idan kun gwada da gaske.
He was about everything.	Ya kasance game da komai.
This thing must be stopped.	Dole ne a daina wannan abu.
He did what he did.	Ya yi abin da ya yi.
I do not want to hear more.	Ban so in kara ji.
I plan to succeed.	Na yi shirin yin nasara.
I'll let myself out.	Zan bar kaina na fita.
And that will make me human.	Kuma abin da zai sa ni mutum.
This should work, please try it out.	Wannan yakamata yayi aiki, da fatan za a gwada.
They are all gone.	Suna nan duk sun wuce.
He knows when.	Ya san lokacin da yake.
Take care of your diet.	Kula da abincin ku.
They plan to travel very well.	Sun yi shirin tafiya sosai.
She drank coffee.	Kofi ta sha.
But she did not write about it.	Amma ba ta rubuta game da shi.
Nothing can be done about it.	Ba za a iya yin komai game da hakan ba.
However, enough for now.	Duk da haka, isa ga yanzu.
He was funny.	Ya kasance mai ban dariya.
So things are.	Haka abubuwa suke.
What could it be	Me zai iya zama
But this is not true.	Amma wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
There is absolutely nothing to do.	Lallai babu abin da za a yi.
I think there is a mistake here.	Ina tsammanin akwai kuskure a nan.
We are not the only ones scared.	Ba mu kadai muke tsoro ba.
Today, there is a lot of money.	A yau, akwai kuɗi da yawa.
It didn't come out well.	Bai fito da kyau ba.
Wait for it.	Jira shi.
I'm afraid that is it.	Ina tsoron cewa wannan shine.
They want to change.	Suna so su canza.
I can hear it.	Zan iya jin shi.
I'm sure you will know what to do.	Na tabbata za ku san abin da za ku yi.
No one came close, in fact.	Babu wanda ya zo kusa, a gaskiya.
Only if there is a problem.	Kawai idan akwai matsala.
They stared at each other for a long time.	Sun dade suna kallon juna.
But still nothing.	Amma har yanzu ba komai.
I read a lot.	Na yi karatu da yawa.
And as much as we can get.	Kuma da yawa idan za mu iya samu.
Which makes it so unusual.	Abin da ya sa ya zama sabon abu.
They never missed a single day for three years.	Ba su taba rasa rana guda ba har tsawon shekaru uku.
Please pay me a refund.	Don Allah a biya ni da kuɗi.
But here, no.	Amma a nan, babu.
She thought he was dead.	Ta yi tsammanin ya mutu.
We forgot to do that.	Mun manta da yin haka.
One about consent.	Daya game da yarda.
Often done.	Sau da yawa ana yi.
It works like this.	Yana aiki kamar haka.
Many just will not accept it.	Da yawa kawai ba za su yarda da shi ba.
I really enjoyed it.	Na samu sosai.
But this is not the case.	Amma ba haka yake ba.
Then it happened.	Sai abin ya faru.
And he didn't feel it.	Kuma bai ji da ita ba.
But they are there.	Amma suna can.
No one has been seen yet.	Har yanzu ba a ga mutum ko daya ba.
I did not try.	Ba na ƙoƙari ba.
He said he would release her after she finished.	Ya ce zai sake ta bayan ta gama.
He left her on the ground, where she died.	Ya bar ta a kasa, inda ta mutu.
I want to hear where you came from.	Ina so in ji labarin inda kuka fito.
Everything is amazing.	Duk abin ban mamaki ne.
They were hit with great success.	An buga su da babban nasara.
But be careful.	Amma a kula.
You have no idea what you are doing.	Ba kuna tunanin abin da kuke yi ba.
I missed some, but not much.	Na rasa wasu, amma ba da yawa ba.
I can not be sure.	Ba zan iya tabbata ba.
They seem to have just gotten in the way.	Da alama sun shiga hanya ne kawai.
Only such a person.	Irin wannan mutumin ne kawai.
I like rain.	Ina son ruwan sama.
In general.	Gaba ɗaya ɗaya.
I hope you can read them.	Ina fata za ku iya karanta su.
That he is also in it.	Cewa shi ma a ciki yake.
Many people wanted to join.	Mutane da yawa sun so su shiga.
I will go, if you will.	Zan tafi, idan kuna so in tafi.
But they are as good as dead.	Amma suna da kyau kamar ba a can yanzu.
I'm not.	Ba ni ba ko.
It makes me work.	Yana sa ni aiki.
I want to be here.	Ina so in kasance a nan.
This is a sick home.	Wannan gidan rashin lafiya ne.
However, it is not very difficult.	Duk da haka, ba shi da wahala sosai.
She did, really.	Ta yi, da gaske.
They just did it.	Sun yi shi kawai.
Hopefully we will continue to do so.	Da fatan za mu ci gaba da yin hakan.
I do not know the exact cause.	Ban san ainihin sa ba.
From this you can be very sure.	Daga cikin haka za ku iya tabbata sosai.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
It is wrong to do.	Ba daidai ba ne a yi.
Sorry to see you go.	Yi hakuri ganin ka tafi.
Ensure careful child care.	Tabbatar da kula da yara a hankali.
But it must have been cold.	Amma tabbas ya zama sanyi.
What else can she do?	Me kuma zata iya yi.
She made a mistake.	Ta yi kuskure.
I do not know what he is doing.	Ban san me yake yi ba.
You cannot use both at the same time.	Ba za ku iya amfani da duka biyu a lokaci guda ba.
Still sick.	Har yanzu rashin lafiya.
This should not be done.	Bai kamata a yi haka ba.
You will go.	Za ku tafi.
If they do, they will probably win.	Idan sun yi, da alama za su yi nasara.
I myself do not understand it very well.	Ni kaina ban gane shi sosai ba.
It has to be what we need to do.	Dole ne ya zama abin da muke bukata mu yi.
I think maybe they will.	Ina tsammanin watakila za su yi.
An exciting time to see a great man succeed.	Lokaci mai ban sha'awa don ganin babban mutum yayi nasara.
They are women.	Mata ne.
We know more than we knew before.	Mun san fiye da yadda muka sani a da.
In the past.	A baya.
What happened to him may not have been known at all.	Wataƙila ba a taɓa sanin abin da ya faru da shi ba.
Whatever it will be.	Duk abin da zai zama.
The money is gone.	Kudi ya kare.
They are.	Haka suke.
You have to take what life gives you.	Dole ne ku ɗauki abin da rayuwa ta ba ku.
They all made their way to him.	Duk suka yi masa hanya.
I was told they were too sweet.	An gaya mini su ma suna da daɗi sosai.
I have them, but without much work.	Ina da su, amma ba tare da aiki mai yawa ba.
It's just the kind of person.	Irin mutumin ne kawai.
I killed	Na kashe
He was difficult for everyone.	Ya kasance mai wahala ga kowa.
I want you to understand if there is.	Ina so ku gane idan akwai.
I understand what you are saying.	Na fahimci abin da kuke cewa.
He can certainly take care of himself.	Babu shakka zai iya kula da kansa.
It is better to forget it.	Zai fi kyau a manta da shi.
I could not run.	Na kasa gudu.
I would be nothing without him.	Ba zan zama komai ba in ba shi ba.
Sign in !.	Shiga ciki!.
You are right to remove it from the current one.	Kun yi daidai kun cire shi daga na yanzu.
We are going for a walk.	Muna tafiya tafiya.
The truth stood out.	Gaskiya ta tsaya.
She asked me something.	Ta tambaye ni wani abu.
Then the dog.	Sai kare.
It's not cold.	Bai yi sanyi ba.
We suffered here.	Mun sha wahala zuwa nan.
After she got up she asked for help.	Bayan ta tashi ta nemi taimako.
But he is on his way.	Amma yana kan hanya.
It's ridiculous.	Rashin hankali ne.
She can give birth.	Za ta iya ba da ciki.
They got up and did it again.	Suka tashi suka sake yi.
So let's leave them.	Don haka mu bar su.
What it is, what it stands for, will not die.	Abin da shi ne, abin da ya tsaya a kai, ba zai mutu ba.
If you haven’t heard, they are really good.	Idan ba ku ji ba, suna da kyau da gaske.
There is something else.	Akwai wani abu kuma.
Pass them now we must.	Wuce su yanzu dole ne mu.
I'm just kidding.	wasa nake kawai.
You forgot something.	Kun manta wani abu.
You are at home.	Kuna gida.
They just do it.	Suna yin haka kawai.
They all succeeded, of course.	Duk sun yi nasara, ba shakka.
Things are not going well in this article.	Abubuwa ba su da kyau a cikin wannan labarin.
She swam like a fish.	Ta yi iyo kamar kifi.
I have never heard of.	Ban taba ji ba.
I'm glad you did better.	Na yi farin ciki da kun fi kyau.
And you will be better off, too.	Kuma za ku fi kyau, ma.
But this was interesting to see.	Amma wannan ya kasance mai ban sha'awa don gani.
Bar is the way, the biggest way right now.	Bar yana hanya, hanya mafi girma a yanzu.
Best of all come with me.	Mafi kyawun ku zo tare da ni.
This is not where things go late.	Wannan ba wurin da abubuwa ke tafiya a makara ba.
People were injured.	Mutane sun ji rauni.
We should go out.	Ya kamata mu fita.
Everything is beyond surprise.	Komai ya wuce abin mamaki.
That is why we cannot cut it.	Shi ya sa ba za mu iya yanke shi ba.
Please just go.	Don Allah kawai ku tafi.
It should be a good day.	Ya kamata ya zama rana mai kyau.
I want to hear what he has to say about it.	Ina so in ji me zai ce a kai.
But she did not plan the project.	Amma bata shirya aikin ba.
I can read that.	Zan iya karanta hakan.
I doubt this alone.	Ina shakka wannan kadai.
That should be sufficient enough.	Wannan ya isa haka.
You will make mistakes from time to time.	Za ku yi kuskure lokaci zuwa lokaci.
She saw it too.	Ita ma ta gani.
Good thoughts come to you too.	Tunani mai kyau yana zuwa muku kuma.
What a year.	Me shekara.
He will not marry her.	Ba zai aure ta ba.
Skin later makes the best skin.	Fata daga baya yana yin mafi kyawun fata.
I want it from here.	Ina son shi daga nan.
He saw nothing.	Bai ga komai ba .
Slowly she closed the door.	A hankali ta rufe kofar.
He must love her.	Dole ne ya so ta.
How the mind works.	Yadda hankali ke aiki.
They give him thirty years.	Suna ba shi shekaru talatin.
If you don't see it, you probably won't get it.	Idan ba ka gani ba, tabbas ba za ka samu ba.
It is twofold.	Abu biyu ne.
Even if it pays you what you want.	Ko da ya biya ku abin da kuke so.
This is not how it works.	Wannan ba shine yadda yake aiki ba.
I can accept that.	Zan iya yarda da hakan.
Where he plans to go.	Inda ya shirya zuwa.
Of course, you have to try.	Tabbas, dole ne ku gwada.
This can take time.	Wannan yana iya yin lokaci.
Not allowed.	Ba a yarda ba.
But other people will not do it.	Amma sauran mutane ba za su yi ba.
You are smart.	Kai mai hankali ne.
They did not, though.	Ba su yi ba, ko da yake.
But don't say or do anything.	Amma kar a ce ko yin komai.
She is not at the station.	Ba ta a tashar.
I got well	Na samu lafiya
These are simple.	Waɗannan su ne masu sauƙi.
He is the one who made me.	Shine wanda yayi min.
So, we keep doing what we want to do.	Saboda haka, muna ci gaba da yin abin da muke so mu yi.
i love you	ina son ku
He had to get up and sit down.	Dole ne ya tashi zaune.
I agree with him.	Na yarda da shi.
It can fix everything.	Zai iya gyara komai.
I want women to touch me.	Ina son mata su taba ni.
He did not see anything new at that time.	Bai ga wani sabon abu ba a lokacin.
I know them well.	Na san su sosai.
All the others like.	Duk sauran kamar da.
More will be seen tomorrow.	Gobe ​​za a sami ƙarin gani.
We really are.	Mu ne sosai.
It was very cold last night.	Yayi sanyi sosai a daren jiya.
He lost his way.	Ya bata hanya.
The three of us came here.	Sai mu uku muka zo nan.
Maybe he did.	Wataƙila ya yi.
He no longer knew what it was.	Bai kara sanin me yake ba.
I was really into it for a while.	Na kasance da gaske a ciki na ɗan lokaci.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.	Za mu yi magana game da shi gobe.
It is a hot day.	Rana ce mai zafi.
You agree who you are, mistakes and all.	Kuna yarda da wanene ku, kuskure da duka.
That hurt me even more.	Hakan ya kara min zafi.
That will happen, it must have happened.	Hakan zai faru, tabbas hakan ya faru.
We are already late.	Mun riga mun makara.
They will not give it to us.	Ba za su ba mu ba.
Come back and help us again, right?	Ka dawo ka sake taimaka mana, ko?
I kept thinking about the problem.	Na ci gaba da tunanin matsalar.
What people like.	Abubuwan da mutane ke so.
He lives with it.	Yana rayuwa da shi.
It makes you feel really good from start to finish.	Yana sa ku ji daɗi sosai daga farko har ƙarshe.
I was very happy.	Na yi matukar farin ciki.
More than there is now.	Fiye da akwai yanzu.
I have it working.	Ina da shi yana aiki.
But we don't have to go now.	Amma bai kamata mu tafi yanzu ba.
I could not prove it.	Na kasa tabbatar da hakan.
Fix it well.	Gyara shi da kyau.
The players knew they could do the job.	'Yan wasan sun san cewa za su iya yin aikin.
Maybe he'll take her back now.	Watakila zai koma da ita yanzu.
The money is good to just get.	Kuɗin yana da kyau don samun kawai.
I hope it doesn't upset her.	Ina fatan bai bata mata rai ba.
I tried it.	Na gwada shi.
I wonder where she lives.	Ina mamakin inda take zaune.
He saw, but did not tell her.	Ya gani, amma bai gaya mata ba.
The only place you know.	Wurin da ka sani kawai.
People want success.	Mutane suna son nasara.
I left it all.	Na bar shi duka.
No way to talk to anyone.	Babu yadda yake magana da kowa.
Now we will give them one.	Yanzu za mu ba su daya.
During the night they left.	Cikin dare suka tafi.
Although this method will work, it is very problematic.	Ko da yake wannan hanya za ta yi aiki, yana da matsala sosai.
Such sadness.	Irin bakin ciki.
I said look where we are.	Na ce a duba ko ina sai inda muke.
How do you do that?	Yaya za ku yi haka?.
God wants you alive.	Allah yana son ka da rai.
They wanted us to be surprised.	Sun so mu yi mamaki.
It was a pleasant trip.	Tafiya ce mai daɗi.
They need to run.	Suna buƙatar gudu.
Work now!	Yi aiki yanzu!
Sometimes it just happened like yesterday.	Wani lokaci ma kamar jiya ne ya faru.
Maybe he was.	Wataƙila ya kasance.
So this is a mistake.	Don haka wannan kuskure ne.
Say it, of course it is.	Ka ce shi, tabbas haka ne.
But he was smart.	Amma ya kasance mai hankali.
You should do it.	Ya kamata ku yi hakan.
She helped him pull out.	Ta taimaka masa ya cire.
They lie that women do not lie.	Suna karya cewa mata ba sa karya.
It should not have happened.	Bai kamata ya faru haka ba.
And so we did.	Kuma haka muka yi.
Come here.	Shiga nan.
I get a dog.	Ina samun kare.
Let's go.	Mu koma.
I just like the heat.	Ina son zafi kawai.
He loves it here.	Yana son shi a nan.
The man was right.	Mutumin ya yi gaskiya.
Fish live in water.	Kifi yana rayuwa a cikin ruwa.
This does not work.	Wannan baya aiki.
They have little money.	Suna da kuɗi kaɗan.
It’s kind of what we do out there.	Yana da irin abin da muke yi fita.
That's it, or more.	Shi ke nan, ko sama da haka.
Just down the road.	Kawai kasa hanya.
I really care about him.	Na damu da shi sosai.
Slowly and slowly.	A hankali kuma a hankali.
It eats almost everything.	Yana cin kusan komai.
But we will be there.	Amma za mu kasance a wurin ta.
They upset her.	Suka bata mata rai.
I can't let that happen again.	Ba zan iya barin hakan ta sake faruwa ba.
The third world is us now.	Duniya ta uku ita ce mu a yanzu.
But we stopped, first.	Amma mun tsaya, da farko.
Every time you try you will make a mistake.	Duk lokacin da kuka gwada za ku yi kuskure.
But maybe they started using the money for other things first.	Amma watakila sun fara amfani da kuɗin don wasu abubuwa da farko.
Stop there.	Ka tsaya a can.
And they sleep a lot at night.	Kuma suna yin barci sosai da dare.
We can be better than that.	Za mu iya zama mafi kyau fiye da haka.
Of course not.	Ko shakka babu ya bayyana.
He read a lot.	Yayi karatu da yawa.
I called your house, but you did not enter.	Na kira gidan ku, amma ba ku shiga ba.
This is a great thing.	Wannan abu ne mai girma.
I'm scared too.	Ni ma na ji tsoro.
She wanted to be honest.	Ta so ya zama gaskiya.
At the same time they must also leave something for chance.	A lokaci guda kuma dole ne su bar wani abu don dama.
No next payment.	Babu biya na gaba.
He did not answer her.	Bai amsa mata ba.
He is certainly on his way above himself.	Lallai yana kan hanya sama da kansa.
I know you're there.	Na san kana can.
This is a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne.
If they refuse, try not to take it personally.	Idan sun ƙi, gwada kada ku ɗauka da kanku.
I will be sick tomorrow.	Za a yi rashin lafiya gobe.
That is why we do what we do.	Shi ya sa muke yin abin da muke yi.
Among many others.	Daga cikin wasu da yawa.
He said I would see.	Yace zan gani.
He failed.	Sai ya kasa.
I am back here myself.	Da ni kaina na dawo nan.
Find out how.	Gano yadda.
They, you know, are intelligent.	Su, ka sani, masu hankali ne.
He will make coffee.	Zai yi kofi.
But she fails to say that now.	Amma ta kasa cewa yanzu.
We talk a little.	Muna magana kadan.
We have been working on such a thing for over two years.	Mun yi aiki a kan irin wannan abu sama da shekaru biyu.
That said.	Abin da ya ce.
In these, you must give me a way.	A cikin waɗannan, dole ne ku ba ni hanya.
Not us, though.	Ba mu ba, ko da yake.
She seemed to hear.	Ta yi kamar ta ji.
Something she said was hard.	Wani abu ta fada yana da wuya.
I told him.	Na ce masa.
She is very beautiful.	Tana da kyau sosai.
She did, slowly.	Ta yi, a hankali.
Only three were surprised.	Uku ne kawai suka yi mamaki.
I do not need sleep.	Bana bukatar barci.
It was a good look, as they say.	Ya kasance mai kyau kama, kamar yadda suke faɗa.
Where to go.	Inda za mu je.
The others are already ahead of me.	Sauran sun riga ni.
It can be anyone.	Tana iya zama kowa.
Just get out of here.	Kawai fita daga nan.
It's amazing.	Abin mamaki ne.
It seems to be non-existent.	Kamar babu ita.
It could be better.	Zai iya zama mafi kyau.
And he would be happy to wait here.	Kuma zai yi farin cikin jira a nan.
For more information, read on.	Don ƙarin sani, karanta a gaba.
Maybe he was there too.	Wataƙila yana can ma.
The game was very successful.	Wasan ya yi matukar nasara.
Have a life, people.	Ku sami rayuwa, mutane.
In fact there is nothing to be seen.	A gaskiya babu wani abu da za a gani.
Maybe they do.	Wataƙila suna yi.
I don't like it that way.	Ba na son wannan hanyar.
So, no mistake, no doubt.	Don haka, babu kuskure, babu shakka.
Whatever you want will be done.	Duk abin da kuke so za a yi.
Time goes on.	Lokaci ya ci gaba.
He would never want to.	Ba zai taba so ba.
Or maybe it was the ship itself.	Ko watakila shi ne jirgin da kansa.
I am still working on a project.	Ina ci gaba da wani aiki.
No need for money.	Babu buƙatar kuɗi.
I hit the third.	Na buga na uku.
I could not speak.	Na kasa magana.
It does not help him find out.	Ba ya taimaka masa gano.
You should just be there.	Ya kamata ku kasance a can kawai.
We just came out and did it.	Mun fito kawai muka yi.
Did not log in.	Bata shiga ba.
Cover the appliance with cold water.	Rufe kayan aikin da ruwan sanyi.
This is just a job for him.	Wannan aiki ne kawai a gare shi.
She will help him, and he will help her.	Za ta taimake shi, shi kuma zai taimake ta.
We may lose the house.	Muna iya rasa gidan.
That's what I got into.	Abin da na shiga kenan.
But, it can be a mistake.	Amma, yana iya zama kuskure.
There he fixed me.	Can kuma ya gyara min.
Everyone knows that winter is the cold season.	Kowa ya san cewa lokacin sanyi shine lokacin sanyi.
Like everything else, you get what you pay for.	Kamar kowane abu, kuna samun abin da kuke biya.
I'll tell him you're not here.	Zan ce masa ba ka nan.
They would never expect that.	Ba za su taɓa tsammanin hakan ba.
Change, of course, but still good.	Canza, ba shakka, amma har yanzu kyau.
But we can not.	Amma ba za mu iya ba.
Not just there.	Ba a can kawai.
I can take it or leave it.	Zan iya ɗauka ko barin shi.
But it is not necessary.	Amma ba dole ba ne.
It looks fine.	Da alama lafiya.
It was for them.	Ya a gare su.
I think you can tell me not to go.	Ina tsammanin za ku iya gaya mani kada in tafi.
This happened to me the second time.	Wannan ya faru da ni a sake yi na biyu.
I can tell anyone.	Zan iya fada da kowa.
This is a good day.	Wannan rana ce mai kyau.
You should do everything you can to help me.	Ya kamata ku yi duk abin da za ku iya don taimaka mini.
You feel like.	Kuna ji kamar.
We do not accept them.	Ba mu yarda da su ba.
I can take you the other way.	Zan iya kai ku sauran hanyar.
I know.	Na sani.
Now or never!	Yanzu ne ko ba zai taba ba!.
We returned home.	Muka koma gida.
But then it will never be the same again.	Amma a lokacin ba za ta sake zama kamar haka ba.
That is what I was told.	Abin da aka gaya mini ke nan.
She could only think ahead.	Ta iya tunanin gaba kawai.
But you will not be able to do both at the same time.	Amma ba za ku sami yin duka biyu a lokaci ɗaya ba.
She got this.	Ta samu wannan.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu wani abu da ya wuce haka, a yanzu.
Very good talk.	Magana mai kyau sosai.
Everything is moving fast.	Komai yana tafiya da sauri.
Let's go where it is needed.	Mu je inda ake bukata.
Two, they are married.	Biyu, sun yi aure.
He replied that he did not get it.	Ya amsa da cewa bai samu ba.
And it will happen in a week.	Kuma zai faru a cikin mako.
It's only a matter of time.	Na ɗan lokaci ne kawai.
I want to go home with her.	Na so in tafi gida da ita.
There you are, the truth has come out.	Akwai inda kuke, gaskiya ta fito.
This happens often.	Hakan yana faruwa sau da yawa.
Where no one can see.	Inda babu wanda ya iya gani.
Little by little.	Kadan kadan.
We are moving fast.	Muna tafiya da sauri.
Looking for a practical way.	Ana neman hanya mai amfani.
That everyone agrees with that no matter what.	Cewa kowa ya yarda da hakan ko da menene.
I was surprised.	Na yi mamaki.
Do your homework first.	Yi aikin gida tukuna.
It’s not something we get or fail to get.	Ba wani abu ne da muke samu ko kasa samu ba.
This is where we never went.	A nan ne ba mu taɓa zuwa ba.
It is a difficult task.	Aiki ne mai wahala.
The world needs you now more than ever.	Duniya tana buƙatar ku yanzu fiye da kowane lokaci.
No you do not have to work.	A'a ba lallai ne ku yi aiki ba.
By the time she got in at the time, there was nothing for her.	Sai da ta shiga a lokacin, babu wani abu gare ta.
Very good !.	Yayi kyau sosai!.
However today, we continue to spend money that is not there.	Duk da haka a yau, muna ci gaba da kashe kuɗin da ba a can ba.
I'm just kidding.	Ina wasa ne kawai.
You may be nervous about eating at a restaurant.	Kuna iya jin tsoro game da cin abinci a gidan abinci.
The man fell asleep through both.	Mutumin ya yi barci ta hanyar duka.
Surprisingly no one did.	Abin mamaki ba wanda ya yi.
Even if she got too much.	Ko da ta samu ta yi yawa.
But when she got up and went home, the problem began.	Amma da ta tashi ta koma gida sai matsalar ta fara.
After a while, he went back.	Bayan wani lokaci, ya koma baya.
I will not go out with anyone.	Ba zan fita da kowa ba.
You must have this.	Dole ne ku sami wannan.
So what we saw, began to tell you what we saw.	Don haka abin da muka gani, ya fara gaya muku abin da muka gani.
Then a noise was heard.	Sai aka ji wata kara.
He will kill himself, he will kill us all.	Zai kashe kansa, zai kashe mu duka.
No one has it.	Babu wanda yake da shi.
We are looking for more money.	Muna neman ƙarin kuɗi.
But he failed, still.	Amma ya kasa, har yanzu.
To be able to check the time.	Don samun damar duba lokaci.
Otherwise nothing.	In ba haka ba ba komai.
And because of me.	Kuma saboda ni ne.
So very comfortable.	Don haka jin daɗi sosai.
This is your problem.	Wannan matsalar ku.
This will be you hot.	Wannan zai zama ku mai zafi.
This is not the way.	Wannan ba hanya ba ce.
We never really believed you needed them.	Ba mu taɓa yarda da gaske kuna buƙatar su ba.
There, she thought.	Can kuma, ta yi tunani.
Somehow he failed.	Ko ta yaya ya kasa.
I think you are lying.	Ina ganin karya kuke yi.
All this is useful for the future.	Duk wannan yana da amfani ga nan gaba.
People make money from this work.	Mutane suna samun kuɗi daga wannan aikin.
So she saved.	Don haka sai ta ajiye.
Without you you would not be sick.	Ba tare da ku kuna rashin lafiya ba.
But it can really.	Amma yana iya gaske.
I'll tell you when.	Zan gaya muku yaushe.
I'd like to have a room for myself.	Ina son samun dakin da kaina.
It could be the local police.	Zai iya zama 'yan sanda na gida.
Time flies.	Lokaci yana tashi.
But she could not understand.	Amma ta kasa gane.
It turns out it can't be taken.	Ya bayyana ba za a iya ɗauka ba.
It is not difficult to understand why.	Ba shi da wuya a gane dalilin da ya sa.
I missed this.	Na bata wannan.
But she wouldn’t say anything helped me.	Amma ba za ta ce komai ya taimake ni ba.
It gives you pleasure.	Yana ba ku jin dadi.
One of the things is to be careful.	Daya daga cikin abubuwan shine a kula.
I add things to it nicely, no problem there too.	Ina ƙara abubuwa zuwa gare shi da kyau, ba matsala a can ma.
Despite her failure, she did not fall to her knees.	Duk da ta kasa, ba ta yi kasa a gwiwa ba.
Here you are.	Ga ku yaro.
All life is like that.	Duk rayuwa haka ne.
I could not understand where the problem lay.	Na kasa gane inda matsalar take.
Do not sleep.	Kar ka yi barci.
She doesn't want anyone to know about it.	Bata son kowa ya sani game da ita.
Movie only.	Fim kawai.
She still has it.	Har yanzu tana da shi.
She found out she was pregnant.	Ta gano tana da ciki.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Even	Ko da
Maybe, a little.	Wataƙila, kaɗan.
But it is time to move on.	Amma lokaci ya yi da za a ci gaba.
Or he shouldn’t have got it.	Ko kuma bai kamata ya samu ba.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
You will never know for sure, but she agrees.	Ba za ku taɓa sanin tabbas ba, amma ta yarda.
Just a dog.	Kare kawai.
It is better to do something early.	Gara wani yayi wani abu da wuri.
Keep the door open.	Ci gaba da bude kofar.
I do not want to sleep.	Ban so barci ba.
They are very weak.	Sun yi rauni sosai.
Then she sat down to work despite her tiredness.	Sai ta zauna bakin aikin duk da ta gaji.
This also requires work.	Wannan kuma yana buƙatar aiki.
Sometimes they stayed there until the sun came up.	Wani lokaci suna zaune a wurin har rana ta fito.
I think we will agree.	Ina tsammanin za mu yarda.
That hurt her a little.	Hakan yayi mata kadan.
But he never thought of that.	Amma bai taba tunanin wannan ba.
They grew up familiar with each other.	Sun girma sun saba da juna.
It's too hot.	Akwai zafi mai yawa.
Some women.	Wasu mata kuma.
You need to talk to her.	Kuna buƙatar magana da ita.
The train traveled slowly.	Jirgin ya yi tafiya a hankali a hankali.
Why?' 	Me ya sa?'
She was arrested, but was soon released.	An kama ta, amma da sauri aka sake ta.
I didn’t tell him much.	Ban gaya masa da yawa ba.
Fill me up again.	Cika ni a sake.
She sold me.	Ta sayar da ni.
We have to be on it.	Dole ne mu kasance a kai.
She knew nothing, apparently.	Ba ta san komai ba, da alama.
He opened the front door and entered.	Ya bude kofar gida ya shiga.
I gave him everything.	Na ba shi komai.
Otherwise we refuse.	In ba haka ba mu ƙi.
Well, until the end.	Da kyau, har zuwa ƙarshe.
It started to rain a lot.	An fara yin ruwan sama mai yawa.
Is there a car park nearby?	Akwai tashar mota kusa da nan?
We should too.	Ya kamata mu ma.
It will waste everyone's time.	Zai bata lokacin kowa.
It would be nice.	Zai yi kyau.
We do not know how it happened.	Ba mu san yadda abin ya faru ba.
And everything works fine.	Kuma komai yana aiki daidai.
The car will start.	Mota za ta tashi.
You can see this for yourself easily.	Kuna iya ganin wannan da kanku cikin sauƙi.
There are so many things you do not understand.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ba ku gane ba.
Somehow, the word always came to him.	Ko ta yaya, kullum magana ta zo masa.
But if one can, he will.	Amma idan mutum zai iya, zai yi.
Start, and finish what you started.	Fara, kuma gama abin da kuka fara.
I have never been human again.	Na taba zama mutum kuma.
He arrives home laughing.	Ya isa gida yana dariya.
Man, of course you are there.	Mutum, tabbas kana can.
But it has to be done !.	Amma dole a yi!.
Too many and too many.	Da yawa kuma da yawa.
I really enjoyed doing so.	Na ji daɗin yin haka sosai.
With practice, they can be heard.	Tare da aiki, ana iya jin su.
We can wait that long.	Za mu iya jira tsawon haka.
No job is working.	Babu wani aiki da yake aiki.
Work for me.	Aiki a gare ni.
After a while, he started playing with the kids.	Bayan wani lokaci, ya fara wasa da yara.
Just sit inside and out now.	Kawai zauna a ciki da waje a yanzu.
He started laughing.	Ya fara dariya.
And it was done.	Kuma an yi haka.
I like it when someone leaves the seat.	Ina son shi idan mutum ya bar wurin zama.
I wrote this.	Na rubuta wannan.
Now here's what they did to him.	Yanzu ga abin da suka yi masa.
But what we need to do is make an effort.	Amma abin da ya kamata mu yi shi ne ƙoƙari.
She wanted to watch him lose his temper.	Ta na son kallon shi ya rasa abin yi.
It's time to sign up.	Lokaci ya yi da za a sa hannu.
They provide very tasty food.	Suna ba da abinci mai daɗi sosai.
Obviously, they must have made a mistake.	Babu shakka, tabbas sun yi kuskure.
We do, however.	Muna yi, duk da haka.
It's not like me.	Ba kamar ni ba ne.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
He heard it too.	Ya ji shi ma.
I hope to come back one day.	Ina fatan in dawo can wata rana.
This is one thing he will not do.	Wannan shi ne abu daya da ba zai yi ba.
I don't want to see anyone.	Ba na son ganin kowa.
Whatever it is, we will work together.	Duk abin da yake, za mu yi aiki tare.
Have you ever been to this place?	Shin kun taɓa zuwa wannan wurin?
But he failed to help.	Amma ya kasa taimaka.
The station will tell you where it is.	Tashar za ta gaya muku inda yake.
Maybe they even know him.	Wataƙila sun ma san shi.
It was cold outside with them.	Ya sanyi sanyi tare da su.
But I did not want to live.	Amma ba na son rai ba ne.
I realized without a doubt when there was nothing I could do.	Na gane ba tare da shakka ba lokacin da babu wani abin da zan yi.
Nothing else happened, really.	Babu wani abu kuma da ya faru, da gaske.
I want to know what is going on.	Ina so in san abin da ke faruwa.
That did not happen.	Hakan bai faru ba.
Best of all this weekend.	Mafi kyawun mafi kyawun wannan karshen mako.
Here is an amazing truth.	Ga wata gaskiya mai ban mamaki.
This is a day so your thoughts.	Wannan wata rana ce don haka wani tunanin ku.
Time is everything.	Lokaci shine komai.
We want to have fun.	Muna so mu ji daɗi.
Go and work for him.	Ku je ku yi masa aiki.
They just won’t admit they made a mistake.	Suna kawai ba za su yarda cewa sun yi kuskure ba.
He wants to be with her.	Yana son zama da ita.
We decided that the flight was good after all.	Mun yanke shawarar cewa jirgin yana da kyau bayan duk.
I sat and waited.	Na zauna jira.
You are here now.	Kuna nan yanzu.
But they are looking for answers.	Amma suna neman amsa.
Let me talk to him.	Bari in yi magana da shi.
Now it seems they are really up.	Yanzu da alama sun tashi da gaske.
I will send him this article.	Zan aika masa wannan labarin.
You were not known at the time, though.	Ba a san ku ba a lokacin, ko.
They pay me this.	Suna biya ni wannan.
He will do it again.	Zai sake yi.
He asked her not to go.	Ya tambaye ta kar ta tafi.
Only the two of us.	Mu biyu kadai.
I did not hear what he said.	Ban ji abin da ya ce ba.
I'll wait for her.	Zan jira da ita.
All this is correct, as he decided to stay here.	Duk wannan daidai ne, kamar yadda ya yanke shawarar zama a nan.
I know what you are hearing.	Na san abin da kuke ji.
We know exactly what we are doing and what we are going to do.	Mun san ainihin abin da muke yi da abin da za mu yi.
We are human.	Mu mutane ne.
You wrote down where this happened.	Kun rubuta wurin da wannan ya faru.
The heat is increasing.	Wurin zafi yana ƙara zafi.
It takes to turn on.	Yana dauka ya kunna.
And good for me.	Kuma mai kyau a gare ni.
He felt the need to express himself.	Ya ji ya zama dole ya bayyana kansa.
And we do not need to suffer.	Kuma ba ma bukatar wahala.
I do not have a car.	Ba ni da mota.
Sleep will be better.	Barci zai yi kyau.
No just, man.	A'a kawai, mutum.
At first they just wanted to.	Da farko sun so kawai.
Maybe he should get it.	Watakila ya kamata ya samu.
I totally agree with your suggestion.	Na yarda da shawarar ku gaba ɗaya.
Life is not good, '' he said.	Rayuwa ba ta dace ba,'' in ji shi.
He never really made the time.	Bai taɓa yin lokacin da gaske ba.
He doesn't want to fight her.	Baya son fada da ita.
Making your money is not worth it.	Neman kuɗin ku bai dace ba.
You should just ask him.	Ya kamata ku tambaye shi kawai.
People will say they will give you something, but they will not touch you.	Mutane za su ce za su ba ku wani abu, amma ba za su taɓa ba.
No more.	Ba kuma.
The same thing happens.	Irin wannan yana faruwa.
It was printed on a train.	An buga shi a cikin jirgin kasa.
Work is very focused on one person.	Aiki yana mai da hankali sosai ga mutum ɗaya.
They were good too.	Sun kasance masu kyau kuma.
You will see that they want to do that.	Za ku ga cewa suna son yin hakan.
He went, he just went.	Ya tafi, kawai ya tafi.
It's about joining.	Yana da game da shiga.
So it seems to work for me.	Don haka da alama yana aiki a gare ni.
He could not explain that.	Ya kasa bayyana hakan.
I think everyone needs to take care of themselves.	Ina ganin kowa yana bukatar ya kula da kansa.
Your day should be a resounding success.	Ya kamata ranar ku ta yi nasara cikin nasara.
They have never heard of such a thing.	Ba su taba jin irin wannan abu ba.
After a week, no one saw or heard from him.	Bayan mako guda, babu wanda ya gani ko ji daga gare shi.
And look to start enjoying.	Kuma kalli fara jin daɗi.
What a joy it is.	Wane irin farin ciki ne shi.
He loves the game, he loves to play.	Yana son wasan, yana son yin wasa.
It’s as good as pleasure.	Yana da kyau kamar jin daɗi.
He told himself this must be the last trip.	Ya ce wa kansa dole ne wannan ya zama tafiya ta ƙarshe.
He wanted to stand outside.	Ya so ya tsaya waje.
Next we confirm.	Na gaba mu tabbatar.
I totally agree.	Na yarda gaba daya.
I do not have this.	Ba ni da wannan.
And that is a mistake.	Kuma hakan ma kuskure ne.
And, there is a lot of truth in that.	Kuma, akwai gaskiya da yawa a cikin wannan.
And they will do whatever you want.	Kuma za su yi duk abin da kuke so.
That's right.	Hakan yayi daidai.
This was easy.	Wannan ya kasance mai sauƙi.
No crying.	Babu kuka.
He is a fighter.	Shi mai fada ne.
He pulled it out, his stomach coming out.	Ya cire shi, ciki ya fita.
He never did it.	Bai taba yin sa ba.
This is good.	Wannan ya yi kyau.
It is more than enough.	Ya fi isa.
I see now you are very worried about him.	Na ga yanzu ka damu da shi sosai.
That's how kids play.	Haka yara ke wasa.
We have time.	Muna da lokaci.
Be interested in them.	Yi sha'awar su.
I think so too.	Ina tsammanin shi ma.
I'm not very good at it.	Bani da kyau sosai.
They are many.	Suna da yawa.
The truth is.	Gaskiya ita ce.
However, this function did not work.	Duk da haka, wannan aikin bai yi aiki ba.
I am more tired than usual.	Na gaji fiye da yadda na saba.
You are so beautiful!	Kun yi kyau sosai!
He got up from his seat.	Ya tashi daga zaune.
I want to have fun.	Ina so in ji daɗi.
I have added it several times.	Na kara da shi sau da yawa.
Now you know why.	Yanzu kun san dalilin.
I want to hear what people think.	Ina so in ji abin da mutane ke tunani.
I myself have never seen them.	Ni kaina ban taba kallon su ba.
I do not have to do this.	Ba sai na yi wannan ba.
It can be done well and it can be done easily.	Ana iya yin shi da kyau kuma ana iya yin shi cikin sauƙi.
Truth may, but it does not.	Gaskiya ta iya, amma ba ta so.
I have changed so much.	Na canza sosai.
This book has a bad reputation.	Wannan littafin yana da mummunan suna.
This is also something that happened two years ago.	Wannan kuma wani abu ne da ya faru shekaru biyu da suka gabata.
At first he could see nothing.	Da farko bai iya ganin komai ba.
This is how you tell people that you are with them.	Wannan shine yadda kuke gaya wa mutane cewa kuna tare da su.
We were able to show that.	Mun sami damar nuna hakan.
He will never see war again.	Ba zai ƙara ganin faɗa ba.
Cold, sweet water.	Sanyi, ruwa mai dadi.
Or it does not appear.	Ko bai bayyana ba.
Immediately, it does not work.	Nan da nan, ba ya aiki.
He did not hear her.	Bai ji ta ba.
We felt right at home with them immediately.	Mun ji daidai a gida tare da su nan da nan.
Let him look.	Bari ya duba.
I can't leave you so much right now.	Ba zan iya barin ku sosai yanzu ba.
He changed the oil in the car.	Ya canza mai a motar.
All about the dog.	Duk game da kare.
Of course I did not tell him the whole story.	Ba shakka ban ba shi labarin duka ba.
It has taken more than a year to do this.	An dauki fiye da shekara guda ana yin hakan.
She is very worried about swimming.	Ta damu sosai game da yin iyo.
The only problem is getting them there.	Matsalar kawai ita ce kai su wurin.
Getting it down, we need it.	Samun shi a kasa, muna buƙatar shi.
This can be a useful activity.	Wannan yana iya zama aiki mai amfani.
One can help but it is uncertain.	Mutum zai iya taimaka amma ba ta da tabbas.
He put one on the day.	Ya saka daya a ranar.
It has never been tested.	Ba a taba gwada shi ba.
Write daily.	Rubuta kowace rana.
For women, it is one drink.	Ga mata, abin sha daya ne.
It is a difficult task.	Aiki ne mai wahala.
There is no one like you, no one is better in the game.	Babu wani kamar ku, babu wanda ya fi kyau a wasan.
But it is not.	Amma ba haka ba.
But she is not dead.	Amma ba ta mutu ba.
Another big mistake.	Wani babban kuskure.
No one behind.	Ba kowa a baya.
So we have to leave it behind here.	Don haka dole ne mu bar shi a baya a nan.
I never knew it was so big.	Ban taba sanin yana da girma haka ba.
It’s the right thing to do.	Abu ne da ya dace.
I would not say kill.	Ba zan ce a kashe ba.
He is OK now.	Yanzu yana lafiya.
Don't just do it.	Kada ku yi shi kawai.
I have to die now.	Dole ne in mutu yanzu.
If nothing happens tomorrow morning, he sells.	Idan wani abu bai faru ba gobe da safe, sai ya sayar.
I do not agree with anything yet.	Ban yarda da komai ba tukuna.
Not for us, however.	Ba gare mu ba, duk da haka.
Success ?.	An samu nasara?.
Well, this is a useful development.	Da kyau, wannan shine ɗan ci gaba mai amfani.
I know it didn't work out.	Na san bai kai ga komai ba.
That is what you told us.	Abin da kuka gaya mana ke nan.
We enjoyed it !.	Mun ji dadi!.
It’s almost local too.	Yana da kusan na gida da yawa.
I thought a little about the future.	Na yi tunani kadan game da gaba.
The man said nothing.	Mutumin bai ce komai ba.
And what happened.	Kuma me ya faru.
No one says anything.	Babu wanda ke cewa komai.
I was wrong.	Na yi kuskure.
With further development.	Tare da ƙarin ci gaba.
Either way, that was in the past.	Ko ta yaya, hakan ya kasance a baya.
You are very wrong.	Kun yi kuskure sosai.
I just like this game.	Ina son wannan wasan kawai.
It's not as good as you think.	Ba shi da kyau kamar yadda kuke tunani.
No, that's worse.	A'a wannan ya fi haka.
And nothing is happening.	Kuma babu abin da ke faruwa.
You are looking down from the sky.	Kana kallon kasa daga sama.
Out of curiosity, how many of you are here?	Saboda sha'awa, ku nawa ne a nan?
Not you.	Ba kai ma ba.
So it works from within.	Don haka yana aiki daga ciki.
We have no money.	Ba mu da kuɗi.
I am very happy about that.	Na yi matukar farin ciki da hakan.
He is not ahead.	Ba ya kasance a kan gaba.
She knows it too.	Ita ma ta sani.
He did not stand together.	Bai tsaya tare ba.
If they can get used to it, that makes me happy.	Idan za su iya samun amfani da shi, wannan yana sa ni farin ciki.
One thing is certain.	Abu daya ya tabbata.
And if you do, the task gets easier.	Kuma idan kun yi haka, aiki yana samun sauƙi.
They did well with it.	Sun yi kyau da shi.
She quickly tidied up the room.	Da sauri ta gyara dakin.
What is the weakest part of any car?	Menene mafi rauni na kowace mota?
The same is true today.	Haka yake a yau.
At that point, he had to take the job.	A wannan lokacin, dole ne ya sha aikin.
Wait and see.	Ku jira ku gani.
We have no more food.	Ba mu da sauran abinci.
So, we are very happy.	Don haka, mun yi farin ciki sosai.
It was a tool, and it stopped working.	Kayan aiki ne, kuma ya daina aiki.
Be with us.	Ku kasance tare da mu.
That's why it's good to hear what you have to say.	Shi ya sa yana da kyau a ji abin da za ku ce.
She left the house crying.	Ta bar gidan tana kuka.
And more than you.	Kuma fiye da ku.
Nothing can be said about them.	Babu abin da za a ce game da su.
Maybe they are scary.	Wataƙila suna da ban tsoro.
She doesn’t talk about this song as much as she used to.	Ba ta magana game da wannan waƙa kamar yadda ake yi.
You can't, it doesn't exist.	Ba za ku iya ba, babu shi.
I too have never been used.	Ni ma ba a taba amfani da ni ba.
We cried, we cried.	Muka yi kuka, muka yi kuka.
I do not like	Ba na so
Just the truth.	Gaskiya kawai.
We are told that there is nothing to fear.	An gaya mana cewa babu abin tsoro.
The bigger the better.	Mafi girma shine mafi kyau.
Can we stop fighting?	Za mu iya daina fada da juna?
And now they really don't let anyone out.	Kuma yanzu da gaske ba su bar kowa ya fita ba.
That made me very happy.	Hakan ya sa na ji daɗi sosai.
It is not enough.	Bai isa ba.
That time is back.	Wannan lokacin ya dawo.
Sometimes much less.	Wani lokaci da yawa kasa.
I did it myself.	Na yi shi da kaina.
He felt better, more than he had in a while.	Ya ji daɗi, fiye da yadda yake da shi a cikin ɗan lokaci.
I should not let that happen.	Bai kamata in bari hakan ya faru ba.
The plane took off.	Jirgin ya tashi sama da sama.
Only one country.	Kasa daya kawai.
You must be tired.	Dole ne ku gaji.
However, we all know that you never knew.	Duk da haka, duk mun san cewa ba ku taɓa sani ba.
And they are moving forward.	Kuma suna gaba gaba.
It seems sitting there.	Da alama zaune a wurin.
I think otherwise.	Ina tsammanin in ba haka ba.
No up, not down.	A'a sama, ba kasa.
Start talking to them.	Fara magana da su.
I can't find a job.	Ba zan iya samun aiki ba.
Maybe they can do a better job than us.	Wataƙila za su iya yin aiki mafi kyau fiye da mu.
I ran from him once.	Na gudu daga gare shi sau ɗaya.
Accept everything you are told.	Ka yarda da duk abin da aka gaya maka.
One thing is certain.	Abu daya ta tabbata.
He ate lunch.	Ya ci abincin rana.
And a lot less happy.	Kuma mai yawa kasa farin ciki.
I'm sure you've heard this story.	Na tabbata kun ji wannan labarin.
Do something sensible.	Yi wani abu mai hankali.
This is how we should expect.	Wannan shine yadda ya kamata mu zata.
But try not to fight them.	Amma ka yi ƙoƙarin kada su yi faɗa.
I came to love him very much.	Na zo son shi da gaske.
The trip was spectacular.	Tafiya ta kasance mai ban sha'awa.
A woman came out and talked to me.	Wata mata ta fito ta yi magana da ni.
I don't know why, it's just.	Ban san dalilin ba, shi ne kawai.
Maybe there is still a way.	Wataƙila har yanzu akwai hanya.
Just what it takes.	Kawai abin da yake bukata.
I didn't want him to stop.	Ban so ya tsaya ba.
Make sure everything is well sealed.	Tabbatar cewa komai an rufe shi da kyau.
You also do not know, at least not know.	Kai ma ba ka sani ba, ko kadan ba a sani ba.
Money is not a matter.	Kudi ba magana ba ne.
It worked for me.	Ya yi min aiki.
Not as he thought.	Ba kamar yadda ya yi tunani ba.
Everything will change, though.	Duk zai canza, ko da yake.
That will not happen here.	Hakan ba zai faru a nan ba.
She opened it, but no one was there.	Ta bude, amma babu kowa.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Ban san akwai irin wannan abu ba.
I have to cover it.	Dole ne in rufe ta.
But she needs someone to make her do it.	Amma tana bukatar wanda zai sa ta yi.
We have to work with two.	Dole ne mu yi aiki da biyu.
Concerns arose over how to pay for it.	Hankali ya tashi kan yadda za a biya shi.
Nailed it.	Na samu.
He can't walk very well.	Ba ya iya tafiya sosai.
But he does not run.	Amma ba ya gudu.
Maybe it's true.	Wataƙila yana da gaskiya.
We will not hear it.	Ba za mu ji shi ba.
He remembers the house he lost.	Ya tuna gidan da ya bata.
That would not have happened.	Da ba zai faru ba.
Wear your clothes because of the cold outside.	Sanya rigar ka saboda sanyi a waje.
We never did more than we could, say.	Ba mu taɓa yin sama da abin da za mu iya ba, a ce.
I did not answer him.	Ban bashi amsa ba.
Just in the movie.	Kamar a cikin fim.
He will do many things today.	Zai yi abubuwa da yawa a yau.
I was right.	Na yi gaskiya.
We'll see if they work.	Za mu gani ko suna aiki.
And eat with other people.	Kuma ku ci tare da sauran mutane.
Or kill you.	Ko kashe ku.
You will never find it there.	Ba za ka taba samun shi a wurin ba.
I have known him for many years.	Na san shi sosai tsawon shekaru da yawa.
He did it without knowing it.	Ya yi shi ba tare da sanin haka ba.
Just save for another day.	Sai kawai su ajiye na wata rana.
Surprisingly, many refuse to do so.	Abin mamaki, mutane da yawa sun ƙi yin hakan.
The first pregnancy started well.	Ciki na farko ya fara da kyau.
Now if you do not mind.	Yanzu idan ba ku damu ba.
And let him go.	Kuma bari ya tafi.
We didn’t do much work yesterday.	Ba mu yi aiki da yawa jiya ba.
I see no reason to stop it yet.	Ban ga dalilin daina shi ba tukuna.
So take it from there.	Don haka ɗauka daga can.
You should come.	Ya kamata ku zo.
He was right about one thing.	Yayi gaskiya akan abu daya.
Sometimes you are, and sometimes you are not.	Wani lokaci kuna, wani lokacin kuma ba ku.
The mind raced.	Hankali ya tashi sama.
Of course he knew that was not true.	Tabbas ya san hakan ba gaskiya bane.
Save it for marriage.	Ajiye shi don aure.
One big job.	Babban aiki daya.
Something people do.	Wani abu da mutane suka yi.
We go on, son.	Mun ci gaba, dan.
I was in this game once.	Na kasance a cikin wannan wasan sau ɗaya.
He started saying something.	Ya fara cewa wani abu.
Cover them during the day.	A rufe su da rana.
Prepare for that.	Shirya don haka.
We are not very close.	Ba mu kusa sosai ba.
Now he wonders why he thinks he can.	Yanzu ya yi mamakin dalilin da ya sa yake tunanin zai iya.
She is actually crying.	A gaskiya tana kuka.
I went inside.	Na shiga ciki.
Can you look at that faster.	Shin za ku iya kallon hakan da sauri.
But here, this time, he grew up.	Amma a nan, wannan lokacin, ya girma.
We always do this.	Kullum muna yin wannan.
They have never been so happy.	Ba su taɓa jin daɗi sosai ba.
I have a bad feeling about this.	Ina da mummunan ji game da wannan.
He was not surprised.	Bai yi mamaki ba.
She ate lunch alone.	Ta ci abincin rana ita kadai.
But be careful not to use too much.	Amma a kula kar a yi amfani da yawa.
They are the only thing.	Su ne kawai abin.
Maybe something will rise.	Wataƙila wani abu zai tashi.
Through the water.	Ta cikin ruwa.
I just waited.	Na dan jira.
Who no one wants.	Wanda babu wanda yake so.
They came out of the station, thinking of the rain.	Sun fito daga tashar, suna tunanin ruwan sama.
He hopes more.	Ya yi fatan ƙarin.
Do not delay.	Kar a bata lokaci.
Truth.	Gaskiya.
I will run.	Zan gudu.
No difficulty.	Babu wahala.
I'm not sure what to fix.	Ban tabbata abin da ya gyara ba.
I love him.	Ina son shi.
He says he knows you and you will help him.	Ya ce ya san ku kuma za ku taimake shi.
That's why he does it.	Shi ya sa yake yin haka.
So it was me.	Don haka ni ne.
It did not turn on.	Bai kunna abin ba.
He did not know what to do.	Bai san abin da ya kamata su yi ba.
I just stood there.	Na tsaya kawai.
It's an amazing thing.	Abu ne mai ban mamaki.
I would love to hear from you.	Zan ji daɗin ji daga gare ku.
I can no longer fight tonight.	Ba zan iya ƙara yin faɗa a daren nan ba.
But it was hard for me.	Amma yana da wuya a gare ni.
Just go take care of it.	Kawai ku je ku kula da shi.
Where is this place?	Wane wuri ne wannan?
God will speak one last time.	Allah zai yi magana ta ƙarshe.
For me it is difficult.	A gare ni yana da wuya.
Nothing greater is necessary.	Babu wani abu mafi girma da ya zama dole.
That is what you need.	Abin da kuke bukata ke nan.
That's why you get mistakes.	Shi ya sa kuke samun kuskure.
I can't, though.	Ba zan iya ba, ko da yake.
I want to see what people are doing with this.	Ina so in ga abin da mutane suke yi da wannan.
It will show everyone.	Zai nuna kowa.
We want to sell it and take the money with us.	Muna so mu sayar da shi mu dauki kudi tare da mu.
I want to know what happened there.	Ina so in san abin da ya faru a can.
It looks amazing.	Ya yi kama da ban mamaki.
I would hate to lose it.	Zan ƙi in rasa shi.
He said she would fit her like a dress.	Ya ce mata zai dace da ita kamar riga.
It was so convenient.	Ya kasance haka dace.
Did you just see what she did?	Kun ga abin da ta yi kawai?
I thought it was funny.	Na yi tunanin abin ban dariya ne.
There are people below.	Akwai mutane a kasa.
No one will take further action.	Babu wanda zai dauki kara.
But he was a good dog.	Amma ya kasance kare mai kyau.
It should be easy to get to.	Ya kamata ya zama mai sauƙi don zuwa.
I remember you since.	Ina tuna ku tun da.
Unless he takes care of them.	Sai idan ya kula da su.
You know how it is.	Kun san yadda take.
No one cared.	Babu wanda ya kula da ita.
This has been fixed.	An gyara wannan.
I really enjoyed this.	Na ji daɗin wannan sosai.
This shows.	Wannan ya nuna.
Hear people too.	Jin mutane ma.
Where is she going now.	Ina za ta je yanzu.
That's what he eats.	Abin da yake ci kenan.
This you can do.	Wannan za ku iya yi.
He knows people love him.	Ya san mutane suna son shi.
He called himself inside.	Ya kira kansa a ciki.
They go right again.	Suna tafiya daidai kuma.
I don't want to do it here.	Ba na so in yi a nan.
She just had to do her best.	Dole ne kawai ta yi mafi kyawun sa.
They were very happy.	Sun yi farin ciki sosai.
It's better tonight.	Ya fi kyau a daren yau.
It tastes so good and it tastes good.	Yana da dadi sosai kuma yana da kyau.
You do not have to do everything yourself.	Ba lallai ne ku yi komai da kanku ba.
The first and third are two.	Na farko da na uku biyu ne.
Of course nothing happens.	Tabbas babu abin da ke faruwa.
I do not know what is going on.	Ban san me ke faruwa ba.
It always puts him down.	Kullum tana sa shi kasa.
That would be a good ending.	Wannan zai zama kyakkyawan ƙarshe.
Nothing to say.	Babu wani abin da za a ce.
Kill the world and do something just for me.	Kashe duniya ka yi wani abu don ni kawai.
That never happened.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
Nothing and everything at once.	Babu komai kuma komai lokaci guda.
Much can happen over a year.	Da yawa na iya faruwa sama da shekara guda.
This program was very simple.	Wannan shirin ya kasance mai sauƙi.
There is not much work to be done at this time.	Babu sauran aiki da yawa a wannan lokacin.
I do not expect such things.	Ba na tsammanin irin waɗannan abubuwa.
It does not take.	Bata dauka ba.
Of course I remember leaving it outside.	Tabbas na tuna na bar shi a waje.
Not once.	Ba sau ɗaya ba.
How long does this take?	Lokaci nawa wannan yana ɗauka.
Is there a way to do this?	Ko akwai hanyar yin wannan?.
Truth must add truth.	Gaskiya dole ta kara gaskiya.
However, this does not go any further.	Duk da haka, wannan baya zuwa wata hanya.
They prepared it.	Wasa suka shirya shi.
Basically, he was wrong.	Ainihin, yayi kuskure.
We pass each other.	Mu wuce juna.
This thing will not help him.	Wannan abu ba zai taimake shi ba.
Then she returned.	Sai ta koma.
One thing is certain.	Abu daya ya tabbata.
So it went on.	Don haka abin ya ci gaba.
Honestly you are not good at this.	Gaskiya ba ku da kyau a wannan.
By the way.	Ta irin da.
I went there years ago.	Na tafi can shekaru da suka wuce.
You can't kill him.	Ba za ku iya kashe shi ba.
They did well.	Sun yi kyau.
Inside there are two people.	A ciki akwai mutane biyu.
After the hot water put me in cold water.	Bayan ruwan zafi ya saka ni cikin ruwan sanyi.
I wish she hadn't done it.	Da ma ba ta yi ma ta ba.
I could be wrong.	Zan iya yin kuskure.
It's not easy.	Ba shi da sauƙi.
I agree with that kind of thing.	Na yarda da irin wannan abu.
After a while she spoke.	Bayan wani lokaci ta yi magana.
It's just time.	Lokaci ne kawai.
Don't stop now.	Kar a tsaya yanzu.
You don't know anyone here.	Ba ku san kowa ba a nan.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Yi hakuri don rashin tabbas.
This will not do at all.	Wannan ba zai yi ba ko kadan.
He does not want to talk.	Baya son magana.
It was about years before they arrived.	Kamar shekaru ne kafin su isa wurin.
He does not hit mistakes or win.	Ba ya buga kuskure ko nasara.
I want you to get out of here.	Ina son ku fita daga nan.
He wants to start.	Yana so ya fara.
The right person.	Mutumin da ya kamata.
I understand that this process takes more time.	Na fahimci cewa wannan hanyar tana ɗaukar ƙarin lokaci.
And we need everything we can.	Kuma muna buƙatar duk abin da za mu iya samu.
Deciding when to travel is not an easy task.	Yanke shawarar lokacin tafiya ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
Get there, but not there yet.	Samun can, amma ba a can ba tukuna.
No, he was not.	A'a, bai kasance ba.
However, they came up with a success in the end.	Duk da haka, sun zo tare da nasara a ƙarshe.
He feels how he feels for me.	Yana jin yadda yake ji a gare ni.
It will surprise you.	Zai ba ku mamaki.
And these things came after two to three years.	Kuma waɗannan abubuwa sun zo bayan shekaru biyu zuwa uku.
I wondered who he was.	Na yi mamakin ko wanene shi.
I want to know what happened after.	Ina so in san abin da ya faru bayan.
They went out.	Suka fita.
It's just me.	Yana da ni kawai.
A little louder.	Kaɗan ƙara.
The game will continue to grow rapidly.	Wasan zai ci gaba da girma cikin sauri.
If you have time.	Idan kana da lokaci.
It will be difficult.	Zai yi wuya.
How long can I wait?	Nawa na iya jira.
He is behind us.	Yana bayan mu.
Walking here was a pleasure.	Tafiya a nan ta kasance mai dadi.
There are three people in the room.	Mutane uku ne a dakin.
I agree with everything except this one statement.	Na yarda da komai sai wannan magana daya.
They clash with each other.	Suna ta karo da juna.
I will talk to the host.	Zan yi magana da mai gida.
They will find a place for everyone.	Za su sami wurin kowa.
And near the road.	Kuma kusa da hanya.
Once a week is good.	Sau ɗaya a mako yana da kyau.
Everyone is fighting for everyone.	Kowa yana fada da kowa.
She knew, of course.	Ta sani, ba shakka.
They are too many.	Sun yi yawa.
That was thirty years ago.	Shekaru talatin da suka gabata kenan.
They prepared volunteers.	Sun shirya masu aikin sa kai.
For some, it might be unusual.	Ga wasu, zai zama sabon abu.
However, we were unable to keep up with it.	Duk da haka, mun kasa ci gaba da shi.
But she got married and left.	Amma ta yi aure ta tafi.
To do so takes time.	Don yin hakan daidai yana ɗaukar lokaci.
He grew up.	Ya girma.
It seems unlikely.	Ba shi da alama.
That, he said, is the key to success.	Wannan, in ji shi, ita ce hanyar samun nasara.
The way of life and myself.	Hanyar rayuwa da kaina.
People are drinking coffee.	Mutane suna shan kofi.
It is time for people to do what is right.	Lokaci ya yi da mutane za su yi abin da ya dace.
I love you more than anyone in the world.	Ina son ku fiye da kowa a duniya.
You need to be very careful when working with them.	Kuna buƙatar yin hankali sosai lokacin aiki tare da su.
It's really, really hard.	Yana da gaske, gaske wuya.
But the problem continues quickly.	Amma matsala ta ci gaba da sauri.
The children are coming and going.	Yara suna zuwa su tafi.
She seems to be talking to him.	Da alama tana masa magana.
She should take good care of this.	Kamata ya yi ta kula da wannan da kyau.
But let's not get out of the way.	Amma kada mu tashi daga kan hanya.
I never heard that again.	Ban sake jin haka ba.
To be able to do what they want.	Don su iya yin abin da suke so.
I want to know everything about her.	Ina so in san komai game da ita.
She is so beautiful.	Ta yi kyau sosai.
I hate them.	Na ƙi su.
He realized now he didn't know what to do with it.	Ya gane yanzu bai san me zai yi da shi ba.
From the beginning you got the best, sure.	Tun da farko kun samu mafi kyau, tabbas.
It cannot be given water.	Ba za a iya ba shi ta ruwa ba.
But they should stop.	Amma su daina.
I don't want anything out of the house.	Bana son komai daga gidan.
Police vehicle not seen.	Motar 'yan sanda ba a gani.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu bai yi daidai ba.
It can happen to anyone at any time.	Yana iya faruwa ga kowa a kowane lokaci.
Do everything you should.	Yi duk abin da ya kamata.
That was the case.	Haka abin ya kasance.
It's just nice to play.	Yayi kyau kawai a yi wasa.
She was something to them.	Ta kasance wani abu gare su.
He doesn't really think about them now.	Ba da gaske yake tunanin su ba yanzu.
Sorry but someone must have told you.	Yi hakuri amma dole ne wani ya gaya maka.
Great thing.	Babban abu.
Try and play what can happen.	Gwada kuma kunna abin da zai iya faruwa.
Anything unpleasant.	Duk abubuwan da ba su da daɗi.
I hope this has been helpful.	Ina fatan hakan ya kasance da amfani.
He was close to calling.	Ya kasance kusa da kira.
I'm looking at this.	Ina kallon wannan.
You can not talk to him.	Ba za ku iya magana da shi ba.
This is not a happy time.	Wannan ba lokacin jin daɗi ba ne.
The man brought twelve others.	Mutumin ya kawo wasu sha biyu.
He needs to get up early.	Yana bukatar tashi da wuri.
Come, tell me more.	Ku zo, ku ƙara gaya mani.
That is what we need.	Abin da muke bukata ke nan.
Maybe she is the one who can do anything.	Watakila da ita shi ne wanda zai iya yin komai.
Like a movie.	Kamar fim.
He understands that now.	Ya fahimci haka yanzu.
But he was right.	Amma ya kasance daidai.
You haven't read the article yet.	Ba ku karanta labarin ba, lokaci.
Work kills you.	Aiki yana kashe ku.
Please someone can do that.	Don Allah wani zai iya yin hakan.
I do not want to know what happened over the weekend.	Ba na son sanin abin da ya faru a karshen mako.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution.	Ya zuwa yanzu babu wanda ya gano.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
Some things just happened.	Wasu abubuwa sun faru kawai.
Now this is a new idea.	Yanzu wannan sabon tunani ne.
This, even more so.	Wannan, ma fiye da haka.
But she did not get this material.	Amma ba ta samu wannan kayan ba.
And it works really well.	Kuma yana aiki sosai.
As we know, however.	Kamar yadda muka sani, duk da haka.
That's the way it is.	Kamar haka abin yake.
Now more than ever.	Yanzu fiye da kowane lokaci.
Play for a while with each other and decide which one is best.	Yi wasa na ɗan lokaci tare da kowane kuma yanke shawarar wanda ya fi kyau.
He said.	Yace .
It is good to see you.	Yana da kyau ganin ku.
Get up and talk!	Tashi yayi magana!.
And they live to play one day.	Kuma suna rayuwa don yin wasa wata rana.
I'll run if you say run.	Zan gudu in ka ce gudu.
He could not break them.	Ya kasa karya su.
They will eat well.	Za su ci da kyau.
You see he wants to write it.	Ka ga yana son ya rubuta shi.
Give me a chance.	Ka ba ni dama.
This also fits perfectly.	Wannan kuma yayi daidai da kyau.
But it had to be brought.	Amma ya zama dole a kawo shi.
Many people do not miss a loved one.	Mutane da yawa ba su rasa wani na kusa ba.
Why of course.	Me ya sa ba shakka.
But now it's over.	Amma yanzu an gama.
I do not know if she ever realized that.	Ban sani ba ko ta taba gane haka.
We can not leave.	Ba za mu iya barin ba.
In fact, no one was in the car.	A gaskiya, babu kowa a cikin motar.
She is also crying.	Ita ma tana kuka.
I want her to be surprised.	Ina son ta yi mamaki.
I take them home now.	Na kai su gida yanzu.
This will not be difficult for me.	Wannan ba zai yi mini wuya ba.
It was good for her, and an opportunity for me.	Ya kasance mai kyau a gare ta, kuma dama ce a gare ni.
Hopefully people like it.	Da fatan mutane suna son shi.
She was wrong, not me.	Ta yi kuskure, ba ni ba.
Although he works with the article.	Ko da yake yana aiki tare da labarin.
It would not have been so cold.	Da ma bai yi sanyi haka ba.
But, as it turned out, he was right.	Amma, kamar yadda ya faru, ya yi gaskiya.
Maybe it was good for me by the way.	Wataƙila yana da kyau a gare ni ta hanya.
Fast, and much.	Da sauri, kuma da yawa.
I'll find another way.	Zan sami wata hanya.
He started driving.	Ya fara tuƙi.
I think it will pass.	Ina tsammanin zai wuce.
It can have many short-term benefits.	Yana iya samun amfani na ɗan lokaci da yawa.
Yes, to be published.	A, da za a buga.
Or children.	Ko kuma yara.
There is no way you can cut it.	Babu wata hanyar da za ku yanke shi.
I have no children.	Ba ni da yara.
Who.	Wanene.
I do not like them, seeing so close.	Ba na son su, ganin haka kusa.
The train stopped.	Jirgin ya tsaya.
Feel free to do just that.	Ji kad'ai saboda haka.
Doing something is something.	Yin wani abu wani abu ne.
During the rainy season.	A lokacin ruwan sama.
He has been in the house ever since.	Yana cikin gidan tun da.
And she said.	Sai ta ce.
But they will never hear again.	Amma ba za su sake jin komai ba.
It will be delicious.	Zai kasance mai daɗi.
I can finish this game.	Zan iya gama wannan wasan.
Give it another week, maybe.	Ka ba shi wani mako, watakila.
Hopefully that does.	Da fatan hakan.
I look at things a little bit.	Ina kallon abubuwa kadan kadan.
I do not know how to do it today.	Ban san yadda zan yi yau ba.
You do not laugh.	Baka dariya.
However, there is an error.	Duk da haka, akwai kuskure.
He does not know where you are going.	Bai san inda za ka ba.
Now it is even more so.	Yanzu ya fi haka yawa.
This is a little annoying to me.	Wannan ya dan bata min rai.
I don't want to play though.	Ba na neman yin wasa ko da yake.
Sit here.	Zauna ta nan.
Almost no one can.	Kusan babu wanda zai iya.
It's almost time.	Kusan ɗan lokaci ne.
It's even better tomorrow.	Ya ma fi gobe gobe.
Of course, it will.	Tabbas, zai yi.
She is very scared of dogs.	Ta ji tsoron kare sosai.
No one cared.	Babu wanda ya kula su.
So, fine.	Don haka, lafiya.
And so it was.	Kuma haka ya kasance.
I know them well.	Na san su da kyau.
He felt like he didn't think so.	Ya ji kamar bai yi tunanin haka ba.
Get the plan.	Samu shirin.
I don't want to hear.	Ba na son ji.
She always goes to work.	Kullum tana tafiya aiki.
It worked.	An yi aiki.
The reason, too, is that they have little to lose.	Dalilin, kuma, shi ne cewa suna da kaɗan don rasa.
That can't really happen.	Wannan ba zai iya faruwa da gaske ba.
How can we know for sure what is true?	Ta yaya za mu san ainihin abin da ke gaskiya?
But he knew she did.	Amma ya san cewa ta yi.
A boy is crying.	Wani yaro yana kuka.
I want to make sure that people will not forget me.	Ina so in tabbatar da cewa mutane ba za su manta da ni ba.
But like, no.	Amma kamar, a'a.
Can we do this ?.	Za mu iya yin wannan?.
We know these things are true.	Mun san waɗannan abubuwan gaskiya ne.
He certainly has it.	Lallai yana da ita.
Now he's gone.	Yanzu ya tafi.
Honestly, it's scary.	Gaskiya, abin ban tsoro ne.
There is a lot of money.	Akwai kudi da yawa.
No, you can not get this!	A'a, ba za ku iya samun wannan ba!
It grows and grows bigger and bigger.	Yana kara girma da girma.
Of course, little has changed.	Lallai, kaɗan ne ya canza.
The man wanted to do it to her.	Mutumin ya so yayi mata.
You know why it is.	Kun san dalilin da ya sa hakan ya kasance.
I do not know why or.	Ban sani ba don me ko.
Don't think of anything else.	Kada ku yi tunanin wani abu kuma.
Do not bring it here.	Kar a kawo shi nan.
You may not even know it is there.	Wataƙila ma ba za ka san yana can ba.
She told me it was my house.	Ta ce min gidan nawa ne.
After he was injured, he felt very bad.	Bayan ya ji rauni, ya ji zafi sosai.
Very much so.	Sosai haka.
We will never do that now.	Ba za mu taɓa yin hakan ba yanzu.
But what do you need.	Amma abin da kuke bukata.
You just have to fill it out.	Kai kawai ka cika.
You need my help.	Kuna son taimako na.
He is just a human being.	Shi mutum ne kawai.
It was like that.	Ya zama kamar haka.
And everything works.	Kuma komai yana aiki.
And, for a while, enough.	Kuma, na ɗan lokaci, ya isa.
We do it voluntarily.	Muna yin haka ba tare da son rai ba.
I try not to think.	Ina ƙoƙarin kada in yi tunani.
We use them a lot.	Muna amfani da su da yawa.
I never knew she had no answer.	Ban taba sanin ta ba ta da amsa.
There is no way to make it.	Babu wata hanya ta sanya shi.
To make people happy.	Don sa mutane su ji daɗi.
She thought she realized that.	Ta dauka ta gane haka.
She has always been that way.	Ta kasance haka koyaushe.
The water is good.	Ruwan yana da kyau.
I would say it is not good.	Zan ce ba shi da kyau.
That should be the right thing to do.	Da ya zama abin da ya dace a yi.
The doctor examined her carefully.	Likitan ya duba ta sosai.
It should not be so.	Bai kamata ya kasance haka ba.
I'm not good at them.	Ba ni da kyau da su.
I was happy.	Na yi farin ciki.
It worked well for everyone.	An yi aiki da kyau ga kowa da kowa.
No, this is not a problem.	A'a, wannan ba matsala.
They have a few to play with.	Suna da 'yan kaɗan da za su yi wasa da su.
He does not live after the work returns.	Ba ya rayuwa bayan aikin ya dawo.
But sometimes you will.	Amma wani lokacin za ku yi.
This is a good opportunity to miss.	Wannan dama ce mai kyau da za a rasa.
The boat stopped at a nearby port.	Jirgin ruwan ya tsaya a wata tashar ruwa da ke kusa.
They failed.	Sun kasa kasa.
Of course I would recommend it to anyone who works.	Tabbas zan ba da shawarar ga duk wanda ke aiki.
I understood everything that had happened.	Na gane duk abin da ya faru.
I do not know they did the second.	Ban sani ba sun yi na biyu.
He is very athletic.	Dan wasa ne sosai.
I asked him if he had ever seen it?	Na tambaye shi ko ya taba gani?
She thought she knew.	Ta dauka ta sani.
It does amazing things.	Yana yin abin ban mamaki.
No one is in the car.	Babu kowa a cikin mota.
I drink from it.	Ina sha daga gare ta.
You can try two things.	Kuna iya gwada abubuwa biyu.
He just told me what to do.	Ya gaya mani kawai abin da zan yi.
But what do we know.	Amma me muka sani.
All of this allows us to achieve more than we lose.	Duk wannan yana ba mu damar samun nasara fiye da yadda muka rasa.
You don’t always get what you want.	Ba koyaushe kuke samun abin da kuke so ba.
That's what he thought.	Abin da ya zata kenan.
Not much, he thought.	Ba yawa, ya yi tunani.
There is no way.	Babu wata hanya.
Write because you must.	Rubuta saboda dole ne ku.
We have nothing to lose.	Ba mu da abin da za mu rasa.
You will feel better if you drink coffee before going to bed.	Za ku ji barci idan kun sha kofi kafin barci.
He agreed to try.	Ya yarda ya gwada.
This dog is just getting it.	Wannan kare yana samun shi kawai.
Bedroom, we both love kids.	Dakin kwana, mu biyu muna son yara.
They started trying to prove the reason for the money.	Sun fara ƙoƙarin tabbatar da dalilin kuɗi.
We always go to school.	Mu ne kullum muke zuwa makaranta.
I did not understand what he wanted.	Ban gane abin da yake so ba.
Sorry you can't see.	Yi hakuri ba za ku iya gani ba.
I don't want her to worry.	Ba na son ta damu.
Some may use other tools.	Wasu na iya amfani da wasu kayan aiki.
Of course he would cut her again before he came back.	Tabbas zai sake yanke ta kafin ya dawo.
And that makes me happy.	Kuma hakan yana sa na ji daɗi.
Let's see what happens.	Bari mu ga abin da ya faru.
I don't know much about him but he knows it's nothing like that.	Ban san da yawa game da shi ba amma ya san ba komai bane haka.
They will not even know she is here.	Ba za su ma san tana nan ba.
He is not pregnant.	Ba ya ciki.
It's about her.	Game da ita ne.
It was also a need she cried.	Wata bukata ce ma ta yi kuka.
One of the best.	Daya daga cikin mafi.
I didn’t take it personally.	Ban dauka da kaina ba.
You know what to do.	Kun san abin da za ku yi.
He will leave the house.	Zai fita daga gidan.
Anyway I'm here.	Duk da haka ina nan.
The moon should be full tonight.	Ya kamata wata ya cika daren yau.
And of course you can see how it looks.	Kuma tabbas za ku iya ganin yadda yake kama.
Or we do what we do, and bring real food.	Ko kuma mu yi abin da muke yi, kuma ku kawo abinci na gaske.
She could say it could have been better.	Ta iya cewa zai iya zama mafi kyau.
And we came back.	Kuma muka dawo.
She can't be blamed right now.	Ba za a iya zargin ta ba a yanzu.
Maybe she was.	Wataƙila ta kasance.
It's still a good run.	Har yanzu yana da kyau gudu.
The speaker told the story.	Mai magana ya ba da labarin.
Can you suggest what might happen ?.	Kuna iya ba da shawarar abin da zai iya faruwa?.
So it is very difficult.	Don haka yana da wahala sosai.
I want you to think this with me.	Ina so ku yi tunanin wannan tare da ni.
I will not do that.	Ba zan yi haka ba.
That is everything that has worked so far.	Wannan shi ne duk abin da ke aiki ya zuwa yanzu.
See how he suffered.	Kalli yadda ya sha wahala.
We will make this trip as fast and efficient as we can.	Za mu yi wannan tafiya cikin sauri da aiki yadda za mu iya.
That's very good.	Hakan yayi kyau sosai.
A lot will come out, but this is good.	Da yawa za su fito, amma wannan yana da kyau.
But it is closed.	Amma an rufe.
I want what will happen in the future.	Ina son abin da zai faru nan gaba.
The world can be global.	Duniya na iya zama na duniya.
But we can know how to respond.	Amma muna iya sanin yadda za mu amsa.
It seems to be working well so far.	Da alama yana aiki da kyau ya zuwa yanzu.
It makes them interested.	Yana sanya su sha'awa.
We are looking for volunteers.	Muna neman masu sa kai.
Some are good at one or the other.	Wasu suna da kyau a ɗaya ko ɗaya.
This has been the case for years.	Wannan shi ne abin da ke faruwa tsawon shekaru.
The train is over.	Jirgin kasa ya kare.
It was not as cold as last night.	Bai kusa yin sanyi ba kamar daren jiya.
She said so.	Ta fada kamar haka.
It is not a lie.	Ba karya ba ne.
Yet the ship knew it would.	Amma duk da haka jirgin ruwa ya san zai yi.
The one who left the other way.	Wanda ya bar sauran hanyar.
They can do whatever they want.	Za su iya yin duk abin da suke so.
It seems good to be true.	Da alama yayi kyau ya zama gaskiya.
There will be a lot of things to do at the festival.	Za a yi abubuwa da yawa a wurin bikin.
He was not accustomed to saying no.	Bai saba a ce masa a'a ba.
Or for others.	Ko ga wasu.
But it's good.	Amma yana da kyau.
A lot needs to be done, however.	Ya kamata a yi abubuwa da yawa, duk da haka.
This will help with them.	Wannan zai taimaka tare da su.
Everything that happened is true.	Duk abin da ya faru gaskiya ne.
Things are not going well for you right now.	Abubuwa ba su yi maka kyau ba a yanzu.
He is more than happy to accept it.	Ya fi farin cikin yarda da shi.
Good for very good athletes.	Yayi kyau ga 'yan wasa masu kyau sosai.
I can’t describe it, but they felt really good.	Ba zan iya bayyana shi ba, amma sun ji sosai.
But everything was ahead.	Amma duk abin ya kasance a gaba.
You must help us.	Dole ne ku taimake mu.
That finally stopped.	Wannan a ƙarshe ya tsaya.
I was able to do that.	Na sami damar yin hakan.
I never did.	Ban taba ta ba.
So there is a lot to do.	Don haka akwai abubuwa da yawa a yi.
Enough driving	Ya isa tuƙi
They would never let me go.	Ba za su taba barin ni in tafi ba.
Without fighting, he would not do it.	Ba tare da fada ba, ba zai yi ba.
I will not touch you.	Ba zan taba ku ba.
But do it right.	Amma yi daidai.
You will live.	Za ku yi rayuwa.
If you have a problem, speak up.	Idan kuna da matsala, ku yi magana.
Maybe it would be better if they did.	Wataƙila zai fi kyau idan sun yi.
So get ready to work.	Don haka ku shirya don yin aiki.
Not much, perhaps.	Ba yawa, watakila.
Things you can't take.	Abubuwan da ba za ku iya ɗauka ba.
Like.	Kamar.
There is no room for error in police work.	Babu dakin kuskure a aikin 'yan sanda.
And she loves it.	Kuma tana son shi.
There is still room for more.	Har yanzu akwai sauran wuri don ƙarin.
I'll just go home.	Zan tafi gida kawai.
But nothing to do.	Amma babu abin yi.
I still can't figure out what it is.	Har yanzu na kasa gane ko menene.
Good music.	Kyakkyawan waƙa.
I was wrong, and he was right.	Na yi kuskure, kuma ya yi gaskiya.
Not one thing.	Ba abu daya ba.
The person has been changed.	An canza mutumin.
It is enough to look at the man.	Ya isa ya duba mutumin.
However, she continued.	Duk da haka, ta ci gaba.
This has never been heard of.	Ba a taɓa jin wannan ba.
It looks amazing.	Ya yi kama da ban mamaki.
And how much I missed.	Kuma nawa ne na rasa.
I want to feel fine.	Ina so in ji lafiya.
If nothing else, that's it.	Idan ba wani abu ba, shi ke nan.
How many do not do this.	Nawa baya yin haka.
When we got up.	Lokacin da muka tashi.
That’s a lot.	Wannan yana da yawa.
I don’t trust anyone, she said.	Ban yarda kowa ba, ta ce.
Just happy, happy, happy.	Farin ciki kawai, farin ciki, farin ciki.
Everyone hates them.	Kowa ya ƙi su.
For me it is a joy.	A gare ni abin farin ciki ne.
But it must be done.	Amma dole ne a yi.
You can't sleep.	Ba za ku iya barci ba.
I'm glad to know.	Na yi farin cikin sani.
The water level is higher than usual.	Ruwan ruwan ya cika fiye da yadda aka saba.
The ground began to cool.	Kasa ta fara sanyi.
I am something totally.	Ni wani abu ne gaba ɗaya.
We called them the police.	Muka kira su 'yan sanda.
It's just fun to write.	Abin farin ciki ne kawai rubuta.
We have to keep going.	Dole ne mu ci gaba.
He tried very hard to make you like him.	Ya yi ƙoƙari sosai don ya sa ku so shi.
You are all needed.	Ana buƙatar ku duka gaba ɗaya.
He enjoyed using it and did well in it.	Ya ji daɗin amfani da shi kuma ya yi kyau a ciki.
But not like everyone else.	Amma ba kamar kowa ba.
It's not like that.	Ba kamar nan ba.
We'll see how it goes when we play.	Za mu ga yadda abin yake idan muna wasa.
I already feel very happy.	Na riga na ji farin ciki sosai.
I'm waiting for some.	Ina jira wasu.
Now, however, she is not too scared.	Yanzu, duk da haka, ba ta da tsoro sosai.
He drank all quickly.	Ya sha duk da sauri.
Great for walking with a working dog.	Mai girma don tafiya tare da kare mai aiki.
They will never let you in.	Ba za su taba bari ka shiga ba.
Can't find more, can you ?.	Ba za a iya neman ƙarin ba, za ku iya?.
I hope that works out.	Ina fatan hakan yayi daidai.
I never thought of leaving here.	Ban taba tunanin barin nan ba.
Everything is fine.	Duk abin yana da kyau.
Let's go find it.	Mu je mu samu.
Until the end.	Har zuwa karshen.
He has to do it.	Dole ne ya yi.
It will start in two days.	Nan da kwana biyu zai fara.
You still do that.	Har yanzu kuna yin hakan.
I have never seen anyone.	Ban taba ganin kowa ba.
Life can only speak life.	Rayuwa za ta iya magana rayuwa kawai.
Take his hand.	Kai masa hannu.
This is because the game is fun.	Wannan saboda wasan yana da daɗi.
I can't help it.	Ba zan iya taimaka masa ba.
So happy day.	Don haka ranar farin ciki.
Going in is like going backwards.	Shiga ciki kamar koma baya ne.
He was immediately promoted.	Nan take aka kara masa girma.
I want to find them in the book.	Ina so in sami su a cikin littafin.
It makes him unable to finish anything.	Yana sa ya kasa gama komai.
If they close, we buy them.	Idan sun rufe, mu saya su.
And it doesn't seem to be getting any easier.	Kuma da alama bai kusa samun sauƙi ba.
I will join you, though.	Zan shiga tare da ku, ko da yake.
I know we will be together again.	Na san za mu sake zama tare.
However, no one understood what was happening.	Duk da haka, babu wanda ya fahimci abin da ke faruwa.
I will see that for myself.	Zan ga haka da kaina.
He has no idea.	Ba shi da tunani.
Where she will surely stay.	Inda tabbas zata zauna.
I have done this so far.	Na yi wannan ya zuwa yanzu.
The year passed quickly.	Shekara ta wuce da sauri.
Definitely something.	Babu shakka wani abu ne.
He looked up.	Ya kalli sama.
I think you will think so.	Ina tsammanin za ku yi tunanin haka.
How he laughed.	Yaya yayi dariya.
I want to be myself	Ina so in zama ni
I will help you in this.	Zan taimake ku a cikin wannan.
He grew up.	Ya girma.
And it's not necessarily about getting somewhere.	Kuma ba lallai ba ne game da isa wani wuri.
I learned that the hard way.	Na koyi cewa da wuya hanya.
Why did you decide to date?	Me ya sa ka yanke shawarar zuwa yau?
Now I can look to the future.	Yanzu zan iya duba gaba na gaba.
I give you.	na ba ku.
She will know when she sees it.	Zata gane idan ta gani.
They are not going to do anything weird.	Ba za su yi wani abu na ban mamaki ba.
Or so you will think.	Ko don haka za ku yi tunani.
Now is not the time.	Yanzu ba lokaci ba ne.
It took me a while to get home.	Na dauki lokaci na dawo gida.
Please think about it.	Da fatan za a yi tunani a kan hakan.
At least he didn't.	Ko kadan bai yi ba.
Get them involved in the program again.	Ka sa su kara shiga cikin shirin kuma.
She was smart, apparently.	Ta kasance mai hankali, da alama.
This is not a fear.	Wannan ba tsoro ba ne.
Now go and leave me alone.	Yanzu je ka bar ni ni kadai.
That is what we need to know.	Abin da ya kamata mu sani ke nan.
I can't go beyond that.	Ba zan iya wuce haka ba.
I don't really see people, either.	Ni ma ba na ganin mutane da gaske, a gaskiya.
Many returned, and he killed them.	Da yawa suka dawo, ya kashe su.
Consciousness is not the right tool for this task.	Hankali ba shine kayan aikin da ya dace don wannan aikin ba.
That fear is good.	Wannan jin tsoro yana da kyau.
I highly recommend it to everyone.	Ina ba da shawarar sosai ga kowa.
He learned a lot from him.	Ya koyi abubuwa da yawa daga gare shi.
He seems to want someone to talk to.	Da alama yana son wanda zai yi magana da gaske.
Staying there is still difficult.	Zama can yana da wuya har yanzu.
It can't happen.	Ba zai iya faruwa ba.
I like that in the morning.	Ina son hakan da safe.
He could not walk.	Ya kasa tafiya.
I'll pass there.	Zan wuce can.
There is a time when you.	Akwai lokacin da kuke.
I do not know why they are so worried.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa suka damu sosai ba.
Our thoughts are with you.	Tunanin mu yana tare da ku.
It's about happiness.	Yana da game da farin ciki.
And now everything is finished.	Kuma yanzu an gama komai.
I feel like it is progress.	Ina jin kamar ci gaba ne.
He said that one day he would get a car.	Ya ce, wata rana, zai samu mota.
Drink, therefore, is not your problem.	Sha, don haka, ba shine matsalar ku ba.
Tell him everything you told me.	Ka gaya masa duk abin da ka gaya mini.
How do you do.	Yadda kuke yi.
We see that.	Muna ganin haka.
I do not want this to happen to anyone.	Ba na son wannan ya faru da wani.
I fell asleep.	Na yi barci.
You will be amazed.	Za ku yi mamaki.
He said.	Yace.
And you need to help us get it back.	Kuma kuna buƙatar taimaka mana mu dawo da shi.
They can not kill anything.	Ba za su iya kashe komai ba.
They hated what was happening.	Sun ƙi abin da ke faruwa.
I worked with her.	Na yi aiki tare da ita.
It went on until it became a pleasure.	Ya ci gaba har ya zama abin jin daɗi.
Like there is something here.	Kamar akwai wani abu a nan.
She let that happen.	Ta bar hakan ta faru.
So the house was not removed.	Don haka ba a cire gidan ba.
Did she bring groceries?	Ta kawo kayan cin abinci?
This is a difficult task.	Wannan aiki ne mai wahala.
I know they have no say in what is good.	Na san ba su da wata magana a kan abin da ke mai kyau.
It's right there.	Yana nan a can.
You want to help somehow.	Kuna so ku taimaka ko ta yaya.
He is a good player.	Dan wasa ne mai kyau.
I know what he's doing.	Na ɗan san abin da yake yi.
We are still working though.	Har yanzu muna aiki ko da yake.
By doing this.	Ta hanyar yin wannan.
That's what he did.	Abin da ya yi kenan.
That is on his own.	Wannan a kansa yake.
Why now?	Me yasa yanzu?.
We will change that over time.	Za mu canza hakan cikin lokaci.
I want someone to help me with this problem.	Ina son wani ya taimake ni da wannan matsala.
But this work should not be brought.	Amma bai kamata a kawo wannan aiki ba.
Marry her.	Aure da ita.
This is very good.	Wannan yana da kyau sosai.
She said she was upset.	Ta fad'a tana bata rai.
Just this past weekend.	Kawai wannan karshen mako da ya gabata.
One or two are eating.	Daya ko biyu suna ci.
That may not be true.	Wannan ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
I touched it in my hand.	Na taba shi a hannu.
However, there is still much work to be done.	Duk da haka, da sauran aiki da yawa a yi.
If you do not write, you want not to write.	Idan ba ku rubuta ba, kuna son kada ku rubuta.
And they all went.	Kuma duk sun tafi.
He must know what is going on.	Dole ne ya san abin da ke faruwa.
I have made mistakes many times in the past.	Na yi kuskure sau da yawa a baya.
This dog wants to play.	Wannan kare yana son yin wasa.
I will never go there.	Ba zan taɓa zuwa wurin ba.
When the metal is hot, it becomes liquid.	Lokacin da karfe ya yi zafi, ya zama ruwa.
That never happened.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
I'm not afraid anymore.	Bana jin tsoro kuma.
Can't imagine why.	Ba za a iya tunanin dalilin da zai yi ba.
Do not overdo it.	Kar a wuce amfani.
We heard them.	Mun ji su.
So this too will pass.	Don haka wannan ma zai wuce.
And this time it will be smart.	Kuma wannan lokacin zai kasance mai hankali.
Kids always want to know things.	Yara koyaushe suna son sanin abubuwa.
It was either us or them.	Ya kasance ko mu ko su.
He may not even believe you.	Wataƙila ma ba zai yarda da ku ba.
Until tonight.	Har daren nan.
Here it is again.	Ga shi kuma.
I do not know where he is.	Ban san inda yake ba.
They need a place to live.	Suna buƙatar wurin zama.
This is for you first.	Wannan a gare ku farko.
He will be happy if we do not come back.	Zai yi farin ciki idan ba mu dawo ba.
Let me explain it this way.	Bari in bayyana shi ta wannan hanyar.
I need to read this today.	Ina bukata in karanta wannan a yau.
It just takes work.	Yana ɗaukar aiki kawai.
Come and try it today.	Ku zo ku gwada shi yau.
We were cold inside.	Muka yi sanyi a ciki.
He may feel it coming.	Yana iya jin yana zuwa.
The time for truth is near.	Lokacin gaskiya yana kusa.
One can drink the water without fear.	Mutum zai iya shan ruwan ba tare da tsoro ba.
He went with that.	Ya tafi da cewa.
Of course, that is the right thing to do.	Tabbas tabbas hakan shine daidai abin yi.
I am not well.	Ba ni da lafiya.
This is not entirely the case.	Wannan ba gaba ɗaya ba ne.
That sounds like a joke to me.	Wannan kamar abin ban dariya ne a gare ni.
The man was very cold.	Mutumin ya kasance mai sanyi sosai.
Nothing to see, nothing to hear.	Ba abin da za a gani, ba abin da za a ji.
You will not do this alone.	Ba za ku yi wannan kadai ba.
We started some, and we looked at them.	Mun fara wasu, kuma mun duba su.
And they are mine now.	Kuma sun kasance nawa yanzu.
She killed him.	Ta kashe shi.
I hope you come back to read this.	Ina fatan kun dawo don karanta wannan.
You are the problem here.	Kai ne matsalar nan.
Great place.	Wurin girma.
He is a talkative man.	Mutum ne mai yawan magana.
I slept alone.	Na kwana ni kadai.
I'll just start talking to someone.	Zan fara magana da wani kawai.
I doubt it, mind you.	Ina shakka da shi, hankali ku.
We understood a little and lost it.	Mun fahimci kadan kuma muka rasa shi.
Throughout.	Duk lokacin.
But there was only me.	Amma akwai ni kawai.
That's what people were talking about at the time.	Haka mutane suka yi magana a lokacin.
To me, that sounds like a lot of effort.	A gare ni, wannan yana kama da ƙoƙari mai yawa.
No problem there.	Babu matsala a wurin.
Still, when you need them, they are not here.	Har yanzu, lokacin da kuke buƙatar su, ba su nan.
Maybe I still do.	Wataƙila har yanzu ina yi.
Time to give it a try.	Lokaci don ba shi hankali.
Speak up, 'she said.	Yi magana,' in ji ta.
It has been used in the past.	An yi amfani da shi a baya.
It must be this time of year again.	Dole ne ya zama wannan lokacin na shekara kuma.
For the back.	Don baya.
We have been waiting for this for a long time.	Mun dade muna jiran wannan.
Maybe that sounds good, but it doesn't feel right.	Wataƙila hakan yayi kyau, amma bai ji daɗi ba.
He feels how he feels.	Yana jin yadda yake ji.
He has already learned to take care of living things.	Ya riga ya koyi kula da abubuwa masu rai.
She will be beaten.	Za a buga mata.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Wataƙila hakan ya kasance saboda mutane kaɗan ne ke samun aiki.
You are wrong.	Kun yi kuskure.
But people came in, and they enjoyed it.	Amma mutane sun shiga, kuma sun ji daɗin hakan.
And there, do it.	Da can, yi haka.
Life is hard there.	Rayuwa tana da wahala a wurin.
They told us about bad food.	Sun gaya mana game da mummunan abinci.
They are gone now.	Sun tafi yanzu.
But it will happen.	Amma zai faru.
He had to commit suicide.	Dole ne ya kashe kansa.
I hope I do well one day.	Ina fatan in yi kyau wata rana.
I think it could be so.	Ina tsammanin zai iya zama haka.
Until then, let me just be clear.	Har sai lokacin, bari kawai in bayyana da gaske.
He raises his hand.	Ya daga hannu.
Two kids talking about school.	Yara biyu suna magana game da makaranta.
He said she too.	Yace ita ma.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
I looked around the room.	Na kalli dakin.
They will not work.	Ba za su yi aiki ba.
Afterwards, sit next to me.	Bayan haka, zauna kusa da ni.
But this time.	Amma wannan lokacin.
So really, really, we never went.	Don haka da gaske da gaske, ba mu taɓa tafiya ba.
Some think he was right.	Wasu suna ganin ya yi gaskiya.
I will tell you everything when you get here.	Zan gaya muku komai idan kun isa nan.
Come in, do it and go out.	Shiga, yi kuma ku fita.
I was worried about what the morning would bring.	Na damu da abin da safe zai kawo.
And what a delicious find it is.	Kuma abin da wani dadi samu shi ne.
You will never know until you have looked.	Ba za ku taɓa sani ba sai kun duba.
Just for me.	Don ni kawai.
But it can be real.	Amma yana iya zama na gaske.
We are not surprised you do.	Ba mu yi mamakin ka yi ba.
That would be very similar to you.	Hakan zai yi kama da ku sosai.
She just couldn't do it.	Kawai ta kasa yin hakan.
We planned to go to dinner.	Mun shirya za mu je cin abincin dare.
Finally you appear.	A ƙarshe kun bayyana.
Maybe she was right.	Wataƙila ta yi gaskiya.
And such is it.	Kuma irin shi ne.
Others insulted him.	Wasu kuma suka yi masa rashin hankali.
I have no idea about it.	Ba ni da wani ji game da shi.
The restaurant serves food all day, every day.	Gidan cin abinci yana ba da abinci duk rana, kowace rana.
No one will know what she did.	Ba wanda zai san abin da ta yi.
It will be just for the two of us.	Zai zama kawai ga mu biyu.
But in fact there is no way I can say.	Amma a gaskiya babu yadda zan fada.
I do not know how to help you.	Ban san yadda zan taimake ku ba.
It will not open.	Ba zai bude ba.
So it’s a little weird.	Don haka yana da ɗan ban mamaki.
There is before and after.	Akwai kafin da kuma bayan.
You can make your mind grow.	Kuna iya sa tunanin ku ya girma.
For someone to come and help.	Don wani ya zo ya taimaka.
We hope you enjoy !!!.	Muna fatan za ku ji daɗi!!!.
We love it here safe.	Muna son shi a nan lafiya.
That sounds like a win for me.	Wannan yana kama da nasara a gare ni.
Please check the following response.	Da fatan za a duba amsa mai zuwa.
You will not go.	Ba za ku tafi ba.
To know that you are here.	Don sanin cewa kuna nan.
So our new meeting.	Don haka sabon taron mu.
We could not see anything.	Ba mu iya ganin komai ba.
I'm waiting	Ina jira
I want to start	Ina so in fara
We never talked about it.	Ba mu taba magana game da shi ba.
Or even think about them.	Ko ma tunani game da su.
She opened the door and entered.	Ta bude kofar ta shiga.
So we have to do that.	Don haka dole mu yi haka.
The journey was difficult.	Tafiya ta kasance mai wahala.
Obviously this does not work.	Babu shakka wannan baya aiki.
You did everything.	Kun yi komai.
He cares about you.	Ya damu da kai.
Do not drink too much coffee.	Kada ku sha kofi da yawa.
This is the man.	Wannan shi ne mutumin.
And they probably want to stay somewhere.	Kuma tabbas suna so su zauna a wani wuri.
Not very good.	Ba kyau sosai.
You have to hurry.	Dole ne ku yi sauri.
That's right.	Yayi daidai.
This is nothing new.	Wannan ba sabon abu bane.
She was so good at it.	Ta yi kyau sosai a haka.
If only you could do a little more work.	Idan da za ku iya yin aiki kaɗan.
Watch them.	Kallon su.
I prepared for that.	Na shirya don haka.
You look nice.	Kun yi kyau.
That was clear to me.	Hakan ya bayyana a gare ni.
She loves me.	Tana son ni.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba abin mamaki ba ne.
This is a simple fix.	Wannan gyara ne mai sauƙi.
He knew he was better than that.	Ya san ya fi haka.
Always do the same thing at the same time.	Koyaushe yin abu ɗaya a lokaci guda.
I didn’t really think so.	Ban yi tsammanin da gaske ba ne.
Yet she continued to fight.	Amma duk da haka ta ci gaba da fada.
They are not against me.	Ba sa gaba da ni.
What kind of food, how much food.	Wani irin abinci, nawa abinci.
Problems in sleep.	Matsala a cikin barci.
They are visible and can be seen.	Suna da gani kuma ana iya gani.
He wanted to know the time.	Ya so ya san lokacin.
People think.	Tunani mutane sun yi.
We knew him at the time.	Mun san shi a lokacin.
It happened to me too.	Hakan ya faru da ni kuma.
So we were able to get in.	Don haka mun sami damar shiga.
Probably the most frightening if it is.	Wataƙila ya fi jin tsoro idan ya kasance.
Love it or leave it.	Son shi ko bar shi.
I know we hit the ground running.	Na san mun buga kasa.
Maybe he will find it.	Wataƙila zai gano shi.
I started drinking a lot.	Na fara sha da yawa.
Touch it gently, gently.	Taba shi a hankali, a hankali.
We lived in the same house.	Muka zauna a gida daya.
We are planning to get married in two months.	Muna shirin yin aure wata biyu kenan.
What to look forward to.	Abin jira a gani.
She has been living alone ever since.	Ita kadai take zaune tun lokacin.
Make no mistake, boy.	Kada ku yi kuskure, yaro.
So they lived together.	Haka suka zauna tare.
Nothing to do.	Babu abin yi.
Come this way, please.	Zo ta wannan hanya, don Allah.
Probably so.	Watakila ma haka ne.
They need to be.	Suna bukatar zama.
It's visual.	Yana da abin gani.
Of course we did.	Tabbas mun yi.
Here they live.	Nan suke zaune.
She can't walk now.	Ba ta iya tafiya a yanzu.
It would be good to remember that.	Zai yi kyau ta tuna da hakan.
Listen, we will let you go back to work.	Ji, za mu bar ku ku koma bakin aiki.
In the end, no one is playing.	A ƙarshe, babu wanda ke wasa.
For you.	Na ka.
Not just me, with everyone who wants to hear.	Ba tare da ni kadai ba, tare da duk wanda ke son ji.
But she failed.	Amma ta kasa.
How much.	Nawa.
Your interests like what they like, healthy or not.	Sha'awar ku suna son abin da suke so, lafiya ko a'a.
And making food goes beyond just eating.	Kuma yin abincin ya wuce abinci kawai.
After he passed she went for the third.	Bayan ya wuce ta tafi na uku.
We even swam.	Har ma mun yi iyo.
It seems like a big deal.	Da alama babban aiki ne.
It does well.	Yana yin kyau.
They are what they are.	Su ne abin da suke.
He moved well.	Ya koma da kyau.
I think the end is already here.	Ina tsammanin ƙarshe ya riga ya kasance a nan.
I want to know.	Ina so in sani.
Without it the project could not be completed.	Idan ba tare da shi ba ba za a iya gama aikin ba.
You are right.	Kuna da gaskiya.
So it seems.	Don haka da alama.
They did not find what they were looking for.	Ba su sami abin da za su ci gaba ba.
They need to rethink.	Suna buƙatar sake tunani.
No one on the channel will know anything.	Babu wani a tashar da zai san komai.
Great sadness is good.	Babban bakin ciki yana da kyau.
Of course I'm tired of the past.	Tabbas na gaji a baya.
There is very little water there.	Akwai ruwa kadan a wurin.
And it really works.	Kuma da gaske yana aiki.
You want to explain it a little bit.	Kuna so ku bayyana hakan kadan kadan.
And they spoke well.	Kuma sun yi magana mai kyau.
I am home now.	Ina gida yanzu.
It seems to help.	Da alama ya taimaka.
If you are sure.	Idan kun tabbata.
Is there an easier way?	Ko akwai wata hanya mafi sauƙi.
I do not see what else you can do.	Ban ga me kuma za ku iya yi ba.
And if we are going to go, we have to do it right away.	Kuma idan za mu tafi, dole ne mu yi haka nan da nan.
This is what will happen.	Wannan shi ne abin da zai faru.
That would be wrong.	Hakan ya zama ba daidai ba.
But not really.	Amma ba da gaske ba.
Our efforts on the final project adds to that.	Ƙoƙarin da muka yi a kan aikin na ƙarshe ya ƙara da cewa.
This is not something for the person.	Wannan ba wani abu bane ga mutumin.
I think so from you.	Ina tsammanin haka daga gare ku.
You know they are tired of hearing the news.	Ka san sun gaji da jin labarin.
I will think about it.	Zan yi tunani game da shi.
The food went well.	Abincin ya tafi lafiya.
He will definitely get a very good reading.	Tabbas tabbas zai sami karatu mai kyau sosai.
I'm tired of it.	Na gaji da shi.
How surprised she was.	Yaya ta yi mamaki.
It will start to work.	Zai fara aiki.
But he did the right thing.	Amma abin da ya dace ya yi.
But he knew he would not do it.	Amma ya san ba zai yi ba.
The big surprise was that it happened so quickly.	Babban abin ban mamaki shi ne abin ya faru da sauri.
I think that is sad.	Ina ganin hakan abin bakin ciki ne.
That was interesting.	Hakan ya kasance mai ban sha'awa.
I'm fine though.	Ina lafiya ko.
That makes it right for me.	Wannan ya sa ya dace da ni.
So stupid.	Don haka rashin hankali.
But they may not even want to do that.	Amma watakila ma ba su so yin hakan ba.
By this time he was really dead.	A wannan lokacin ya mutu da gaske.
You may not like it at all.	Wataƙila ba za ku so shi ba.
She got an injury to her arm.	Ta samu rauni a hannu.
You try not to die, and you are the last person in life.	Kuna ƙoƙarin kada ku mutu, kuma ku ne mutum na ƙarshe a rayuwa.
It was simple and easy to do.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi da sauƙi a yi.
I will give him something to take home with him.	Zan ba shi abin da zai kai gida da shi.
He did not understand.	Bai gane ba.
She stood in the doorway.	Ta tsaya a bakin kofar.
Money is your tool to change the world.	Kudi shine kayan aikin ku don canza duniya.
I still sat for a while.	Na zauna har yanzu na ɗan lokaci.
Everyone sat down, except me.	Kowa ya zauna, ban da ni.
Me, and many others throughout the year.	Ni, da wasu da yawa a cikin shekara ta.
It works for me.	Yana aiki a gare ni.
We will go home now.	Za mu koma gida yanzu.
However, here it is.	Duk da haka, ga shi nan.
I did not think so.	Ban yi tunanin haka ba.
One of two things will happen.	Daya daga cikin abubuwa biyu zai faru.
And in the end, ill ask myself why.	Kuma a karshen, rashin lafiya tambayi kaina dalilin da ya sa.
He felt cut off.	Ya ji an yanke shi.
But just be careful if you do.	Amma kawai a kula idan kun yi.
Then another call came.	Sai wani kira ya sake zuwa.
Make sure you don't miss it !.	Tabbatar kada ku rasa shi!.
It comes out of the hand.	Yana fita daga hannu.
We can hurry.	Za mu iya yin sauri.
Some things cannot be changed.	Wasu abubuwa ba za a iya canza su ba.
It's a good life there.	Rayuwa ce mai kyau a can.
And often it is.	Kuma sau da yawa shi ne.
Others are sitting and talking.	Wasu kuma suna zaune da shi suna magana.
He had to buy it twice before he got it.	Sai da ya saya sau biyu kafin ya samu.
It does not seem so.	Da alama ba haka bane.
They are wrong.	Suna kuskure.
I don't have to go in and fix it.	Ba sai na shiga yi masa gyara ba.
Home is the place that is inside you.	Gida shine wurin da ke cikin kan ku.
Not safe to eat.	Ba lafiya don cin abinci ba.
Only one person was injured.	Mutum daya da ya ji rauni ne kawai.
How wrong we were.	Yaya kuskure muka yi.
These are the best players in the world.	Waɗannan su ne mafi kyawun 'yan wasa a duniya.
It happens every year several times.	Ya faru a kowace shekara da yawa.
You are afraid of everything.	Kuna tsoron komai.
You love driving and you do well to make it.	Kuna son tuƙi kuma ku yi kyau yin sa.
All, but one.	Duk, amma daya yake.
Drinking no name.	Shan babu suna.
I can think.	Zan iya tunani.
But without it, it’s not much better.	Amma ba tare da shi ba, bai fi kyau ba.
He kept running fast.	Ya yi ta gudu da sauri.
I want to read it.	Ina so in karanta shi.
They do not know where it comes from.	Ba su san daga ina ya fito ba.
I wonder what he wants for me this moment, she thought.	Ina mamakin abin da yake so a gare ni wannan lokacin, ta yi tunani.
They’re so cute, and you’re so easy.	Suna da kyau sosai, kuma kun kasance da sauƙi.
You should only take your money.	Ya kamata ku ɗauki kuɗin ku kawai.
They will be very afraid.	Za su ji tsoro sosai.
Some things have also changed.	Wasu abubuwa kuma sun canza.
It came out of the mind.	Ya fita daga tunani.
The water is cold and sweet.	Ruwan yayi sanyi da dadi.
She still hasn't told him.	Har yanzu bata gaya masa ba.
He told me to stay in the restaurant.	Ya ce in zauna a cikin gidan abinci.
It has been that way for a long time.	Ya dade a haka.
But it happened.	Amma ya faru.
That sounds good.	Hakan yayi kyau.
Or that no.	Ko kuma cewa babu.
People should know it.	Ya kamata mutane su san shi.
I don't mind talking to him sometimes.	Ba na damu da magana da shi wani lokacin.
Had he been to do the right thing.	Da ya kasance don yin abin da ya dace.
Or see for yourself.	Ko gani da kanku.
Do you really need it? 	Kuna buƙatar shi da gaske?
It became a novelty for the filmmaker.	Ya zama sabon abu ga mai yin fim.
I ran.	Na gudu.
I found out he did.	Na gano cewa ya yi.
Things are not always the same as they used to be.	Abubuwa ba koyaushe suke kamar yadda suke ba.
But no one cared about the past.	Amma ba wanda ya kula a baya.
He told me to get up.	Ya ce in tashi.
I said no.	Na ce a'a.
But, no, they are out here.	Amma, a'a, sun fita a nan.
This is not a time or place.	Wannan ba lokaci ba ne ko wuri.
And often, it kills them.	Kuma sau da yawa, yana kashe su.
As many, however, they were good.	Kamar yadda da yawa, duk da haka, sun kasance masu kyau.
He is not on his own.	Ba ya kan sa.
He is still a human being.	Har yanzu mutum ne.
So we made progress.	Don haka mun sami ci gaba.
That being said, a lot.	Abin da ke nan yana magana, da yawa.
I can see them doing it.	Ina iya ganin su suna yi.
Then the mind came back.	Sai hankali ya dawo.
This is too fast.	Wannan ya yi sauri da yawa.
He may stay there for a while.	Zai iya zama a can na ɗan lokaci.
She says she does.	Ta ce tana yi.
I do not know how to change it.	Ban san yadda zan canza shi ba.
So, finally.	Don haka, a ƙarshe.
Why does this person talk more than anyone else?	Me yasa wannan mutumin ya fi kowa magana?
He fell into a trance.	Ya fad'a cikin rashin dad'i.
Most intelligent people will do.	Mafi yawan masu hankali za su yi.
He got well.	Ya samu lafiya.
And he wants to see this man.	Kuma ya so ya ga wannan mutumin.
But, more is needed.	Amma, ana buƙatar ƙarin yin.
We all wanted to go.	Mu duka mun so mu tafi.
There are many, many more to be made here.	Akwai da yawa da yawa da za a yi suna a nan.
However, this second marriage took some time.	Duk da haka, wannan aure na biyu ya ɗauki ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
We won one game.	Mun ci wasa daya.
Maybe they will see that they cannot.	Wataƙila za su ga ba za su iya ba.
The first thing tomorrow.	Abu na farko gobe.
Every film should have its own comic strip.	Kowane fim ya kamata ya kasance yana da kansa mai ban dariya.
But not what we found in that ship.	Amma ba abin da muka samu a cikin wannan jirgin ba.
And sometimes it works.	Kuma wani lokacin yana aiki.
This is hard to let go.	Wannan yana da wuya a bari a tafi.
It may be later today.	Yana iya zama daga baya yau.
I can't get into that.	Ba zan iya shiga cikin hakan ba.
I do not need a house like this.	Bana bukatar gida irin wannan.
We must change that.	Dole ne mu canza hakan.
I'm tired of the game.	Na gaji da wasan.
Everyone must have this opportunity.	Dole ne kowa ya sami wannan damar.
You will not save anything.	Ba za ku ajiye komai ba.
I have to try.	Dole ne in gwada.
There are a lot more than us.	Akwai mai yawa fiye da mu.
She talked to people.	Ta yi magana da mutane.
One should be optimistic.	Ya kamata mutum ya kasance da kyakkyawan fata.
The sun still shines.	Har yanzu rana ta fito.
And it wouldn’t be like leaving her.	Kuma ba zai zama kamar barin ta ba.
They have many children.	Suna da yara da yawa.
But he didn't seem to expect an answer.	Amma da alama bata yi tsammanin amsa ba.
The work is good and very enjoyable.	Aikin yana da kyau kuma yana da daɗi sosai.
It's amazing to me.	Yana da ban mamaki a gare ni.
I do not see why.	Ban ga dalilin da ya sa ba.
One can move on.	Mutum zai iya ci gaba.
That never happened.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
This has been a long time coming.	Wannan ya dade a baya.
She knew she had to try.	Ta san dole ta gwada.
Think about what brought you here first.	Ka yi tunanin abin da ya kawo ka da farko.
This article, too, seems to have happened more than once.	Shi ma wannan labarin, kamar ya faru fiye da sau ɗaya.
But life, of course, is not real.	Amma rayuwa, ba shakka, ba gaskiya ba ce.
The man grew up.	Mutumin ya girma.
It looks amazing.	Ya yi kama da ban sha'awa.
For two years.	Har tsawon shekaru biyu.
Maybe I don't understand it.	Wataƙila ban gane shi ba.
But he also did not close the door.	Amma shi ma bai rufe kofar ba.
While.	Lokaci.
This, as we have seen, is not so here.	Wannan, kamar yadda muka gani, ba haka yake ba a nan.
I still see so much.	Har yanzu ina ganin haka da yawa.
For one.	Na daya.
That is what some people did.	Haka wasu mutane suka yi.
It is a good film.	Fim ne mai kyau.
But not really.	Amma ba sosai.
She is very sick, very weak.	Ba ta da lafiya sosai, ta yi rauni sosai.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
He heard a noise.	Ya ji kara.
Please go watch this movie.	Don Allah ku je ku kalli wannan fim ɗin.
She is at home.	Tana gida.
This is not a good thing, this should not happen.	Wannan ba abu ne mai kyau ba, wannan bai kamata ya faru ba.
There it is.	Akwai shi.
Talk to your doctor.	Yi magana da likitan ku.
But not when he is busy.	Amma ba lokacin da yake bakin aiki ba.
But you can help me if you can tell me more.	Amma za ku iya taimaka mini idan za ku iya gaya mani ƙarin.
But there is a place.	Amma akwai wuri.
You don’t even find them interesting, don’t you.	Ba ka ma samun su da ban sha'awa, ba da gaske ba.
He may have been wrong about that.	Wataƙila ya yi kuskure game da hakan.
I was so close!	Na yi kusa sosai!
Sorry to hear you are ill.	Yi hakuri da jin kun yi rashin lafiya.
I was a little scared, but one said don't kill me.	Na ɗan ji tsoro, amma ɗaya ya ce kar a kashe ni.
But they don't want to think about it.	Amma ba su son yin tunani a kan hakan.
Everyone ate.	Kowa ya ci abinci.
It is not safe to smoke.	Ba shi da lafiya shan taba.
We are very focused.	Muna mai da hankali sosai.
Of course, this is nothing new.	Tabbas, wannan ba sabon abu ba ne.
The decision is reserved for the future.	An ajiye shawarar don nan gaba.
Just let me be.	Kawai bari in kasance.
I can't wait to see what I buy.	Ba zan iya jira in ga abin da zan saya ba.
Let them weep.	Su yi kuka.
It's hard to explain, exactly.	Yana da wuya a bayyana, daidai.
Not readers carefully.	Ba masu karatu a hankali ba.
I hope they will.	Ina fatan za su so.
Look at this.	Kalli wannan.
It looked like the end.	Ya yi kama da ƙarshe.
She can come here now.	Tana iya zuwa nan yanzu.
He is actually who he wants to be.	Shi ne ainihin wanda yake so ya zama.
So let's do it.	Don haka bari mu yi.
But he missed, big time.	Amma ya rasa, babban lokaci.
They do what they do and we do what we do.	Suna yin abin da suke yi kuma muna yin abin da muke yi.
I want to forget it, but it stays with me.	Ina so in manta da shi, amma ya zauna tare da ni.
They have to be somewhere.	Dole ne su kasance wani wuri.
Every child should learn to play with tools.	Ya kamata kowane yaro ya koyi wasa da kayan aiki.
Work on it still unfinished.	Har yanzu ba a gama aiki a kai ba.
I did not check.	Ban duba ba.
What a place this is.	Wane wuri ne wannan.
I fell asleep working.	Na yi barci ina aiki.
Somehow.	Ko ta yaya.
But there are many other things that can be done.	Amma akwai wasu abubuwa da yawa da za a iya yi.
In the car.	A cikin motar.
The game is not even close.	Wasan bai ma kusa ba.
He is the one who tells the story.	Shi ne yake ba da labarin.
It certainly did not fail very well.	Lallai bai yi kasa sosai ba.
This did not happen.	Wannan bai faru ba.
No doubt they were afraid of what was about to happen.	Babu shakka sun ji tsoron abin da ke shirin faruwa.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
It's easy for you.	Yana da sauƙi a gare ku.
It cannot be reached.	Ba za a iya isa gare shi ba.
We hope to see you again next time.	Muna fatan sake zuwa lokaci na gaba.
He had to tell her.	Sai da ya gaya mata.
But he needed her, and she enjoyed it.	Amma yana bukatar ta, kuma ta ji daɗin jin.
I work as usual.	Ina aiki kamar koyaushe.
And yet, it is almost always full of people.	Kuma duk da haka, kusan ko da yaushe yana cika da mutane.
I can't do without it.	Ba zan iya yi ba in ba ita ba.
It's better.	Ya fi kyau.
Try reading this.	Gwada karanta wannan.
He was a great man.	Ya kasance babban mutum.
Anyway this talk is gone.	Ko duk da haka wannan magana ta tafi.
This is something new for me.	Wannan wani sabon abu ne a gare ni.
He sat closer than usual.	Ya zauna kusa fiye da yadda ya saba.
But that doesn't work anymore.	Amma hakan baya aiki kuma.
Not really.	Ba sosai ba.
You have to come here.	Dole ku zo nan.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
You don’t get any more attention.	Ba ku sami ƙarin hankali ba.
There is nothing in it.	Babu komai a ciki.
It has to be something people pay for.	Dole ne ya zama abin da mutane za su biya.
I would never like it.	Ba zan taba son ta ba.
Big mistake.	Babban kuskure.
Let's finish it.	Mu gama da shi.
She is beautiful.	Tana da kyau.
We used to have it.	Mun kasance muna da shi.
We are trying to make it easy.	Muna ƙoƙarin yin sauƙi.
Very few have done so successfully.	Kadan ne suka yi shi cikin nasara.
Obviously, they haven’t changed much.	Babu shakka, ba su canza da yawa ba.
It could not be otherwise.	Ba zai iya zama in ba haka ba.
He fell into cold water.	Ya fad'a cikin ruwan sanyi.
She drank coffee.	Kofi ta sha.
Maybe that's what happened.	Wataƙila abin da ya faru ke nan.
He did not know what he wanted to do.	Bai san me yake son yi ba.
If you can help me that would be great.	Idan za ku iya taimake ni hakan zai yi kyau.
Not much.	Ba da yawa ba.
One for each.	Daya ga kowane.
This is the only job she can do.	Wannan aiki ne kawai za ta iya yi.
She sees.	Ta gani.
He has done many things for me.	Ya yi min abubuwa da yawa.
This thing was new to him.	Wannan abin ya zama sabon abu a gare shi.
This is not too late.	Ba wannan a makara ba.
He is now.	Ya kasance yanzu.
Why do you think so?	Me ya sa ka yi tunanin haka?
I miss him every day.	Na rasa shi kowace rana.
That was beyond surprising, but here it goes.	Wannan ya wuce ban mamaki, amma a nan ya tafi.
He won't talk to me anymore.	Ba zai kara min magana ba.
He died.	Ya mutu.
A lot of fat.	Mai yawa mai.
Live in it like your home.	Ku zauna a ciki kamar gidan ku ne.
People are joining.	Mutane suna shiga.
I saw it for myself.	Na ga haka da kaina.
She has not finished eating.	Bata gama cin abincin ba.
That will do for us.	Hakan zai yi mana.
He was alone.	Ya kasance shi kaɗai.
Make a big one.	Yi babban daya.
Just everything that fascinated me at the time.	Kawai duk abin da ya bani sha'awa a lokacin.
Be an athlete.	Zama ɗan wasa.
He went on.	Ya kara gaba.
I caught it at the gas station earlier.	Na kama shi a gidan mai a baya.
Maybe it will be the last.	Wataƙila zai zama na ƙarshe.
That was too much for me.	Wannan duk ya yi mini yawa.
I love him	Ina son shi
She was smart, but not perfect.	Ta kasance mai hankali, amma ba ta cika ba.
It will not happen tomorrow, but it will.	Ba zai faru gobe ba, amma zai zo.
First, do not look back or down.	Na farko, kada ka kalli baya ko kasa.
I love her.	Ina son ta.
He told her to come in.	Yace mata ta shiga.
I don’t know how he came up with that name.	Ban san yadda ya zo da wannan sunan ba.
You will start here.	Za ku fara a nan.
Now is not the time.	Yanzu ba lokacin ba ne.
He told us the whole story.	Ya ba mu labarin duka.
Be careful here.	Yi hankali a nan.
If one does, accept it.	Idan mutum ya yi, ka yarda da shi.
You do not know exactly how we are.	Ba ku san ainihin yadda mu muke ba.
However, the story continues.	Duk da haka, labarin ya ci gaba.
It would not be me.	Ba zai zama ni ba.
But he also would not let her go ahead of time.	Amma kuma ba zai bari ta tafi gaba da lokaci ba.
Nothing killed them.	Ba abin da ya kashe su.
I, one, am the last.	Ni, ɗaya, ni ne na ƙarshe.
Whenever it is.	Duk lokacin da yake.
Reserve.	Ajiye.
Today, however, this is not true.	A yau, duk da haka, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Probably better than anyone else.	Wataƙila ya fi kowa.
You talk to each other and have fun.	Kuna magana da juna kuma kuna jin daɗi.
It's funny.	Yana da ban dariya.
Reading funny things always makes me laugh.	Karanta abubuwan ban dariya koyaushe yana bani dariya.
And you were not.	Kuma ba ku kasance ba.
Then ask him.	Sai ka tambaye shi.
It can, a little.	Yana iya, kadan.
She could not cry.	Ta kasa yin kuka.
She saw what had happened.	Ta ga abin ya faru.
More than once.	Fiye da sau ɗaya.
And apparently nothing will help.	Kuma da alama babu abin da zai taimaka.
It's too hot.	Yayi zafi ta wuce gida.
But you need to take care of yourself too.	Amma kuna buƙatar kula da kanku kuma.
The more I did.	Da na kara yi.
Immediately I knew what had happened.	Nan da nan na san abin da ya faru.
He said no.	Yace a'a.
He is definitely ahead at this point.	Babu shakka yana dan gaba a wannan lokacin.
Many people try to quit smoking every year.	Mutane da yawa suna ƙoƙari su daina shan taba kowace shekara.
Work and passion are everything to him.	Aiki da sha'awar su ne komai a gare shi.
She wondered what he was thinking.	Ta yi mamakin me yake tunani.
He can do whatever he wants.	Yana iya yin yadda ya ga dama.
Maybe even just a toy.	Watakila ko da kawai abin wasan yara.
He sighed again.	Ya sake yin fata.
You need something, talk to me.	Kuna buƙatar wani abu, magana da ni.
Not in a month.	Ba a cikin wata daya ba.
It's very sad.	Yana da matukar bakin ciki.
Right now we are not doing that.	A yanzu ba haka muke yi ba.
A little be patient, you are wanted.	Kadan ka kasance mai hakuri, ana son ka.
I was wrong.	Na yi kuskure.
Life is wonderful.	Rayuwa abu ne mai ban mamaki.
She did it.	Ta yi shi.
So sorry, doing this but.	Don haka hakuri, yin wannan amma.
I can hear her crying.	Ina jin tana kuka.
I think he enjoyed it.	Ina tsammanin ya ji daɗi.
Very enjoyable work.	Aiki mai daɗi sosai.
She is the only one person got.	Ita kadai ce mutum daya samu.
Be there today, all very well.	Kasance a can yau, duk yayi kyau sosai.
Not at this time.	Ba a wannan lokacin ba.
This is, of course, a great thing.	Wannan, ba shakka, abu ne mai girma.
I think of life as a whole without them.	Ina tunanin rayuwa gaba ɗaya ba tare da su ba.
Unusual things to see here.	Abubuwan da ba a saba gani ba a nan.
But you must help me.	Amma dole ne ku taimake ni.
But you can’t have both, man.	Amma ba za ku iya samun duka biyu ba, mutum.
One makes you feel good.	Daya sa ka ji dadi.
And we accept them.	Kuma mun yarda da su.
Of course he could not find out where he was.	Tabbas ya kasa gano inda yake.
It was nice to take some time for myself.	Ya ji daɗi don ɗaukar ɗan lokaci don kaina.
Now he can do whatever he wants.	Yanzu yana iya yin abin da yake so.
That must have come from me.	Wannan dole ne ya fito daga gare ni.
He is alive, but only.	Yana da rai, amma kawai.
Some have used it, which they can get out of it.	Wasu sun yi amfani da shi, abin da za su iya samu daga ciki.
But it is coming.	Amma yana zuwa.
We are on the right track.	Muna kan gaskiya.
Water, however, is water.	Ruwa, duk da haka, ruwa ne.
He knows what is to come.	Ya san abin da zai zo.
I feel very comfortable here.	Ina jin dadi sosai a nan.
Like it or not, you will die.	Kuna so ko a'a, za ku mutu.
That would not be right.	Da bai yi daidai ba.
But then he just reminded me.	Amma sai kawai ya tuna min.
You have a lot.	Kuna da yawa.
He would never think about what to do about them.	Ba zai taɓa tunanin abin da za a yi game da su ba.
I'm not sleeping.	Ba barci nake yi ba.
Players play the best.	'Yan wasa suna wasa mafi kyau.
He is very local.	Yana cikin gida sosai.
It travels fast.	Yana tafiya da sauri.
They will ask you why you are looking for a job.	Za su tambaye ku dalilin da yasa kuke neman aiki.
Just, mind you, this.	Kawai, ka kula, wannan.
She hopes not.	Ta yi fatan ba shi ba.
They never worked.	Ba su taɓa yin aiki ba.
I once read something about coffee.	Na taɓa karanta wani abu game da kofi.
I said it was.	Na ce yana da.
No one will think.	Ba wanda zai yi tunani.
She had never felt that way before.	Ba ta taba jin haka ga kowa ba.
But weakness is weakness.	Amma rauni rauni ne.
But the way he looked at her was amazing.	Amma irin kallon da yake masa ya yi matukar ban mamaki.
And there it is.	Kuma akwai shi.
I think she is out there.	Ina tsammanin tana can waje.
Then go back and let it happen.	Sai ka koma ka bar abin ya faru.
Work is over.	Aiki ne ya wuce.
This is not recommended.	Ba a ba da shawarar wannan ba.
I have it now too.	Ina da shi a yanzu kuma.
Can't remember where else.	Ba za a iya tuna inda kuma.
She told me your story.	Ta gaya min labarin ku.
My dog ​​loves it.	Kare na yana son shi.
She always goes to school on the bus.	Kullum tana zuwa makaranta a bas.
She suffered a lot.	Ta sha wahala da yawa.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
Wait a moment.	Jira dan lokaci.
And it will not be easy.	Kuma ba zai zama mai sauƙi ba.
Everything is fine with me.	Komai yayi min kyau.
They were talking when he heard the man again.	Suna cikin magana sai ya sake jin mutum.
I do not want or need anything more than that.	Bana so ko bukatar wani abu da ya wuce haka.
I work here.	Ina aiki a nan.
It's a little bit.	Yana da kadan.
Everything is fine.	Komai yana da kyau.
There is no time for homelessness.	Babu lokacin rashin gida.
As they are.	Kamar yadda suke.
He wants what only you can give him.	Yana son abin da kai kaɗai za ka iya ba shi.
I recommend you take a car.	Ina ba da shawarar ku ɗauki mota.
But slowly.	Amma a hankali.
Really, really good.	Gaskiya, da kyau sosai.
Today is more than anything.	Yau ya wuce wani abu.
I doubt you will.	Ina shakka za ku.
I read quickly.	Na karanta da sauri.
They are made correctly.	An sanya su daidai.
It is only.	Abin sani kawai.
But one has to keep going.	Amma dole ne mutum ya ci gaba.
Take time before making a final decision.	Ɗauki lokaci kafin yanke shawarar ƙarshe.
Look again.	Kalli kuma.
I'll check.	Zan duba.
The project killed only one life.	Aikin ya kashe rai ɗaya kawai.
Years of work in the workplace.	Shekaru na aiki a wurin aiki.
It's not fun at all.	Ba abin farin ciki ba ne ko kaɗan.
This is the greatest truth.	Wannan ita ce gaskiya mafi girma.
He did not find a new job.	Bai sami sabon aiki ba.
She knew how much he loved restaurant food.	Ta san yadda yake son abincin gidan abinci.
He told me not to do anything.	Ya ce mini kada in yi komai.
It is clear that the teacher is not well.	Ya tabbata cewa malamin ba shi da lafiya.
I must have made a mistake.	Dole ne in yi kuskure.
I hope they do.	Ina fata za su yi.
Maybe this will continue.	Wataƙila wannan zai ci gaba.
It's a pleasure.	Abin farin ciki ne.
But there is no way to be honest.	Amma babu yadda za a yi na gaskiya.
She did not ask me about it.	Ba ta tambaye ni game da hakan ba.
He thought hard to think of a successful plan.	Ya yi tunani sosai don tunanin shirin nasara.
Everything is a little off.	Komai ya dan kashe kadan.
He came back too soon.	Ya dawo da sauri ma.
Do not open to anyone but me.	Kar ka bude ma kowa sai ni.
We are small.	Mu kadan ne.
Ask before and after.	Tambayi kafin bayan.
They may be like me.	Suna iya zama kamar ni.
Sure someone is lying.	Ya tabbata wani yana karya.
Here are many others.	Ga wasu da yawa.
Some people want to keep spending money.	Wasu mutane sun so su ci gaba da kashe kudi.
It never happened to me.	Bai taba faruwa da ni ba.
That may not be necessary.	Ba za a iya buƙatar hakan ba.
He tells us this story.	Yana yi mana wannan labarin.
Everyone agrees that it is a good movie.	Kowa ya yarda cewa fim ne mai kyau.
When you last spoke to him before he died.	A lokacin da kuka yi magana da shi na ƙarshe kafin ya mutu.
She cuts him close.	Tana yanke shi kusa.
I did not injure anyone.	Ban ji wa wani mutum rauni ba.
Nothing though.	Babu komai ko da yake.
He must have heard something.	Tabbas ya ji wani abu.
In fact we asked everyone.	A gaskiya mun tambayi kowa.
There is still no answer.	Har yanzu babu amsa.
You may even decide that your dog is bigger.	Kuna iya ma yanke cewa kare ku ya fi girma.
I do not know how this can happen.	Ban san yadda hakan zai iya faruwa ba.
What? 	Menene?
We should let it be.	Ya kamata mu bar shi ya kasance.
They come a lot.	Sun zo da yawa.
I hope you will too.	Ina fatan za ku kuma.
The world should know this.	Ya kamata duniya ta san wannan.
It makes me happy just to think about it.	Yana sa ni farin ciki kawai tunani game da shi.
She could not speak.	Ta kasa magana.
The place felt.	Wurin ya ji.
Give me what we want.	Ka ba ni abin da muke so.
They started drinking a lot.	Suka fara sha da yawa.
Sorry it took me so long.	Yi hakuri ya dauki ni tsawon lokaci.
That's how she came out.	Da haka ta fito da ita.
Nothing to show him otherwise.	Ba abin da za a nuna masa in ba haka ba.
Even after many years.	Ko bayan wannan shekaru da yawa.
We know him.	Mun san shi.
I'm waiting for you	Ina jiran ku
Use what works.	Yi amfani da abin da ke aiki.
It is not necessary.	Ba lallai ne ya zama dole ba.
And he kept playing.	Kuma ya ci gaba da wasa.
You gave me this story.	Kun ba ni wannan labarin.
We marvel at the past.	Muna mamakin abubuwan da suka gabata.
It is better to be honest with yourself.	Zai fi kyau a kasance da gaskiya gaba ɗaya.
After two years.	Bayan shekaru biyu.
I don't want to do these things.	Ba na son yin waɗannan abubuwa.
Who can take it?	Wanene zai iya ɗaukar shi?
The process takes some time.	Aikin yana ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Whatever he did, he finished it quickly.	Duk abin da ya yi, ya gama shi da sauri.
The real problem is getting people to see it.	Matsala ta gaske ita ce sa mutane su gani.
Maybe some here feel the same way now.	Wataƙila wasu a nan suna jin haka a yanzu.
I have time yet, but it is certainly not all.	Ina da lokaci tukuna, amma tabbas ba duka ba ne.
I myself do not see.	Ni kaina ban gani ba.
They will kill us.	Za su kashe mu.
You get so you don't.	Kuna samun haka ku ba.
He is still here.	Har yanzu yana nan.
Water is life.	Ruwa shine rayuwa.
I'm not sure I agree with you.	Ban tabbata na yarda da ku ba.
It gradually cooled down.	Ya kara sanyi a hankali.
This is.	Wannan yana da.
Until that happens.	Har sai da abin ya faru.
Whatever they feel, they feel it very much.	Duk abin da suke ji, suna jin shi sosai.
I don't think they will.	Ba na jin za su yi.
But they arrived.	Amma sun isa.
He took her.	Ya tafi da ita.
The food on the day was amazing.	Abincin a ranar yana da ban mamaki.
In fact, even a great study will be available in the near future.	A gaskiya ma, ko da babban karatu za a samu nan gaba kadan.
You will make a big mistake.	Za ku yi babban kuskure.
How much does it look like?	Nawa ne alama?
I'm sure of it.	Na tabbata da shi.
The more he tried, the more he got sick.	Ƙoƙarin da ya yi, sai ya ƙara yin rashin lafiya.
And they have nothing of the same.	Kuma ba su da komai na wannan.
I like it the best.	Ina son shi mafi kyau.
How kind of him.	Yaya irin shi.
That should be it.	Ya kamata hakan ya kasance.
It works well for me.	Yana aiki da kyau a gare ni.
Just don’t cut it.	Kawai baya yanke shi.
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.	Wani lokaci yana aiki kuma wani lokacin bai yi ba.
He will get nothing out of it.	Ba zai samu komai daga ciki ba.
Even many do not.	Ko da yawa ba sa.
This can be anything you want.	Wannan na iya zama duk abin da kuke so.
Life left him a little lost.	Rayuwa ta bar shi kadan ya rasa.
Everything was as it had been.	Komai ya kasance kamar yadda ya bar shi.
I need help to work again.	Ina buƙatar taimako don sake yin aiki.
Put it like this, it's good.	Saka kamar haka, yana da kyau.
Nothing stays with me.	Babu wani abu da ya zauna tare da ni.
And she has to get out of this house.	Kuma dole ta fita daga gidan nan.
It works fine.	Yana aiki lafiya.
They will never rise again.	Ba za su sake tashi ba.
Let's move on.	Mu ci gaba.
Truth is truth.	Gaskiya ita ce gaskiya.
The sun had not yet risen, but it was near.	Rana bai tashi ba tukuna, amma ta kusa.
He has been here a lot.	Ya kasance a nan da yawa.
Do you think that they can imagine anything more?	Kuna tsammanin za su iya tunanin wani abin da ya fi haka.
I have never seen anyone die.	Ban taba ganin wanda ya mutu ba.
I just want him to be happy, he said.	Ina so kawai ya yi farin ciki, in ji shi.
After work.	Bayan aikin.
Imagine if she made a mistake.	Ka yi tunanin idan ta yi kuskure.
So off she went.	Haka ta tafi.
It is water.	Ruwa ne.
So there is an effort on that right now.	Don haka akwai wani ƙoƙari a kan hakan a yanzu.
Maybe even bigger.	Wataƙila ma ya fi girma.
Not a night to miss, if you can.	Ba daren da za a rasa ba, idan za ku iya.
Ask, do not say.	Tambayi, kar a fada.
Life is work.	Rayuwa aiki ce.
You do not have to worry.	Ba lallai ne ku damu ba.
Of course I will be there again.	Tabbas zan sake zama a wurin.
Please give me your advice.	Don Allah a ba ni shawarar ku.
You must check.	Dole ne ku duba.
It will work after all.	Zai yi aiki bayan duk.
They collided with each other.	Suka yi karo da juna.
There are plans to stay.	Ana shirin zama.
He usually eats outside for dinner.	Ya kan ci abinci a waje don cin abincin dare.
That is very interesting.	Hakan yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
Hope you understand.	Da fatan kun gane.
She comes out of the water.	Ta fito daga ruwan.
She was sweet, she loved to laugh.	Ta kasance mai daɗi, tana son dariya.
People need to eat.	Mutane suna buƙatar ci.
We lived.	Mun yi rayuwa.
You can work with them.	Kuna iya aiki da su.
I think he might try to get in and kill me.	Ina tsammanin zai iya ƙoƙarin shiga ya kashe ni.
Maybe one day.	Wataƙila wata rana.
Maybe he expected a lot from himself.	Wataƙila ya yi tsammanin da yawa daga kansa.
Who	Wanene
I can talk about the future.	Zan iya magana game da gaba.
And do not pretend you do not have it in you.	Kuma kada ku yi kamar ba ku da shi a cikin ku.
Allow people to see this the right way.	Ba wa mutane dama su ga wannan hanyar da ta dace.
I went in, and behold, the door was shut.	Na shiga ciki, sai ga kofar ta rufe.
We will talk.	Za mu yi magana.
And now she has reached him.	Yanzu kuma ta isa gare shi.
And he killed many others.	Kuma ya kashe wasu da dama.
If you are happy where you are, good for you.	Idan kuna farin ciki a inda kuke, yayi muku kyau.
You know, when she.	Ka sani, lokacin da ta.
What interests them, impresses us.	Abin da ke sha'awar su, yana sha'awar mu.
I don’t sign up for that kind of thing really.	Ba na shiga don irin wannan abu da gaske.
The content is also interesting, so keep it up.	Abubuwan da ke ciki kuma suna da ban sha'awa, don haka ci gaba da ci gaba.
No, she will not enter again.	A'a, ba za ta sake shiga ba.
That's a laugh.	Dariya kenan.
The tools.	Da kayan aikin.
But she did not like it at first.	Amma ita tun farko bata son sha.
We have to get out of this.	Dole ne mu fita daga wannan.
We have to keep talking.	Dole ne mu ci gaba da magana.
We must admit that we can never agree at all.	Dole ne mu yarda cewa ba za mu taɓa yarda gaba ɗaya ba.
We need the next two things.	Muna bukatar abubuwa guda biyu masu zuwa.
Take good care of it.	A kula da shi da kyau.
You are so beautiful.	Kuna da kyau sosai.
It's the fear of not being there.	Tsoron rashin zama ne.
We wanted to grow.	Mun so mu yi girma.
In the rain, as you do.	A cikin ruwan sama, kamar yadda kuke yi.
As we know it will.	Kamar yadda muka sani zai yi.
There's nothing there, either.	Babu wani abu a can, kuma.
Why her.	Me yasa ta.
She wondered if she had reached the task.	Ta sake tunanin ko ta kai ga aikin.
The night has come.	Dare ya shiga.
The boy said.	Yaro yace.
This dish is so delicious, you can not afford it!	Wannan abincin yana da daɗi sosai, ba za ku iya isa ba!
One killed him.	Daya kashe shi.
Then to the next.	Sai kuma zuwa na gaba.
I want to get married.	Ina son yin aure.
Everyone says it.	Kowa yace ita.
Why don't you do that now.	Me yasa ba za ku yi haka ba yanzu.
She never said that.	Bata taba magana haka ba.
We became residents.	Muka zama masu zama.
I do not like it.	Ba na son shi.
Somewhere, somehow, something went wrong.	Wani wuri, ko ta yaya, wani abu ya faru ba daidai ba.
Join with us.	Shiga tare da mu.
But this is where you need to be careful.	Amma a nan ne ya kamata ku yi hankali.
And he could not find a word to begin with.	Kuma ya kasa samun wata magana da zai fara.
We can't give you everything you want.	Ba za mu iya ba ku duk abin da kuke so ba.
I am not the only one who knows this place.	Ba ni kaɗai na san wannan wurin ba.
We call at home.	Muna kan kira a gida.
You can't even imagine going into this alone.	Ba za ku iya ma tunanin shiga cikin wannan kadai ba.
She knew why she was there.	Ta san dalilin da yasa take can.
Or, if they did, they would never say so.	Ko kuma, idan sun yi, ba su taɓa cewa haka ba.
Others go.	Wasu kuma suka tafi.
Sign in.	Shiga ciki.
It just won’t happen.	Kawai ba zai faru ba.
You may be right.	Kuna iya zama daidai.
What you up to?	Me kuke yi?
John got out of the boat a little bit.	John ya fita cikin jirgin kadan kadan.
She wants to know how.	Tana so ta san yadda.

And she does not want to be.	Kuma ba ta son zama.
After the incident.	Bayan abin ya faru.
You are good, keep up the good work.	Kuna da kyau, ci gaba da aiki mai kyau.
A lot of work.	Aiki da yawa.
Some did not come home.	Wasu ba su zo gida ba.
They have no answer.	Ba su da amsa.
This is difficult to take.	Wannan ke da wuya a ɗauka.
Still asleep! 	Har yanzu barci!
However this is just what we did.	Duk da haka wannan shi ne kawai abin da muka yi.
I want to remove them.	Ina so in cire su.
If they have been used for many years, change them.	Idan an yi amfani da su shekaru da yawa, canza su.
I think it's amazing.	Ina tsammanin yana da ban mamaki.
Maybe someone killed him.	Wataƙila wani ya kashe shi.
She could not keep up with that.	Ta kasa ci gaba da cewa.
Tell us where you are.	Fada mana inda kuke.
All must be done manually.	Dole ne a yi duk da hannu.
It is not finished yet.	Har yanzu bai gama ba.
He agreed to join them.	Ya yarda ya shiga su.
Or what happened.	Ko abin da ya faru.
But that doesn't suit me.	Amma wannan bai dace da ni ba.
That could be a good thing.	Wanda zai iya zama abu mai kyau.
Seriously, go get some water.	Da gaske, je ku sami ruwa.
However, this is not the case here.	Duk da haka, irin wannan ba haka yake ba a nan.
She was right so that she would not be too happy.	Ta yi daidai don kada ta yi farin ciki sosai.
We'll see, though.	Za mu gani, ko da yake.
It wants to be a problem.	Yana son zama matsala.
He made a mistake.	Ya yi kuskure.
No one knows what you want except you.	Ba wanda ya san abin da kuke so sai ku.
I can leave it there.	Zan iya barin shi a can.
I heard it once.	Na ji ta sau daya.
I should have filled it.	Ya kamata ni ne na cika shi.
I knew it would be good.	Na san zai yi kyau.
Look, people were injured last night.	Duba, an ji wa mutane rauni a daren jiya.
The food is gone now.	Abincin ya tafi yanzu.
God is greater.	Allah ne mafi girma.
It allows you to think less.	Yana ba ku damar yin tunani kaɗan.
Of course he has nothing to say.	Tabbas ba shi da abin da zai ce.
It takes a lot of work to get here.	Aiki ne mai yawa don zuwa nan.
They can help us a lot, though.	Za su iya taimaka mana da yawa, ko da yake.
Read it carefully.	Karanta shi a hankali.
No one is too worried.	Babu wanda ya damu sosai.
I have to go.	Dole in tafi.
That's how it was done.	Haka aka yi.
Bow down.	Baka a kasa.
They need you, not just you.	Suna buƙatar ku, ba kawai son ku ba.
I will review it again.	Zan sake duba shi.
It took three.	Ya dauki uku.
He’s getting that fight right now.	Yana samun wannan fada a yanzu.
It’s a lot of things.	Yana da abubuwa da yawa.
It grew like the previous one.	Ya yi girma kamar na baya.
He drinks.	Yana sha.
So that’s part of how we think.	Don haka abin da ke cikin yadda muke tunani.
I told her to look.	Na ce mata ta duba.
I can say that something big has happened.	Zan iya cewa wani babban abu ya tashi.
So don’t expect anything for a year or two in the future.	Don haka kada ku yi tsammanin wani abu na shekara ɗaya ko biyu a wannan gaba.
That's better, he thought.	Wannan ya fi kyau, ya yi tunani.
She will take good care of you, don't worry.	Za ta kula da ku sosai, kar ku damu.
how is the new project ?.	yaya sabon aikin yake?.
Edit the article.	Shirya labarin.
They care about me.	Sun damu da ni.
A month later we decided to stop.	Bayan wata daya muka yanke shawarar ya tsaya.
Later, she found out she was pregnant.	Daga baya, ta gano tana da ciki.
But not with me.	Amma ba tare da ni ba.
If broken, it will be killed.	Idan karya, za a kashe.
But you will not leave us here.	Amma ba za ku bar mu a nan ba.
Work began immediately.	An fara aikin nan da nan.
It's time again.	Lokaci ne kuma.
Wait for me in the car.	Ku jira ni a cikin mota.
I have not told you before.	Ban gaya muku a baya ba.
They have a hard life.	Suna da wahala rayuwa.
But it is, and it works really well.	Amma shi ne, kuma yana aiki sosai.
And nothing.	Kuma ba komai.
Will it bring rain?	Shin zai kawo ruwan sama?
This school is great.	Wannan makaranta tana da kyau.
Do it during the event!	Yi shi a lokacin taron!
So, please people, do not think they are asleep.	Don haka, don Allah mutane, kada ku yi tunanin sun yi barci.
They took nothing and were not afraid of anyone.	Ba su ɗauki komai ba kuma ba su ji tsoron kowa ba.
Just sad.	Bakin ciki kawai.
Obviously, it must be.	Babu shakka, dole ne ya kasance.
You are an amazing person.	Kai mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
No one wants a dog hurt.	Ba wanda yake son kare ya ji rauni.
This is where she grew up.	Nan ne inda ta girma.
The place seems to be local.	Wurin da alama na gida ne.
It was for you.	Ya kasance gare ku.
Wait a moment.	Jira dan lokaci.
I am a person who came back to life.	Ni mutum ne ya dawo rayuwa.

He has known her ever since.	Tun daga nan ya san ta.
She said.	Ta ce.
It will not happen.	Ba zai faru ba.
You got it by yourself.	Kun samu ta hanyar ku.
I can make you come.	Zan iya sa ka zo.
This is like you therefore.	Wannan kamar ku ne saboda haka.
Let them recognize it.	Bari su gane shi.
That will change in the future.	Hakan zai canza a nan gaba.
I use this.	Ina amfani da wannan.
I can't eat anything.	Ba zan iya ci komai ba.
Grow so big.	Girma haka girma.
He was really great.	Ya kasance mai girma da gaske.
Sometimes, he tried to say something.	Wani lokaci, ya yi ƙoƙari ya ce wani abu.
Let's show it.	Mu nuna shi.
You can do something like this.	Kuna iya yin wani abu kamar wannan.
One returns to the individual room.	Daya dawo da mutum dakin.
He is the only person.	Shi kadai ne mutumin.
Maybe you even gave it to him.	Watakila ma ka ba shi.
I did not expect that.	Ban yi tsammanin haka ba.
Let me tell you something.	Bari in gaya muku wani abu.
In fact, it is not the same as heaven.	A gaskiya, ba ɗaya ba ne na sama.
Little by little.	Kadan kadan.
Immediately remove from heat.	Nan da nan cire daga zafi.
The ground will go away.	Kasa zai tafi.
Be careful not to cut yourself.	Yi hankali kada ku yanke kanku.
They are smart now.	Suna da hankali yanzu.
If they want to fight they will fight.	Idan suna so su yi fada za su yi fada.
But it is not.	Amma ba shi ba ne.
But it is not funny.	Amma ba abin dariya ba ne.
It's easier.	Ya fi sauƙi.
They were not very happy with me.	Ba su yi farin ciki sosai da ni ba.
He ran in.	Da gudu ya shiga.
What to do.	Abin da za a yi.
This is not going to be an easy game for me.	Wannan ba zai zama wasa mai sauƙi a gare ni ba.
That was the bottom line.	Haka ya kasance kasa.
I left fast food two years ago.	Na bar abinci mai sauri shekaru biyu da suka wuce.
We continue to work on this.	Muna ci gaba da aiki a wannan.
God, he is in trouble here.	Allah, yana cikin wahala a nan.
She also did not give him a good answer.	Ita ma ba ta bashi amsa mai kyau ba.
I see my thoughts.	Ina ganin tunani na.
I have no one.	Ba ni da kowa.
It has never been rushed.	Ba a taɓa yin sauri ba.
Like the rest of us.	Kamar sauran mu.
No worries.	Ba za a damu ba.
I certainly can't write it.	Lallai ba zan iya rubuta shi ba.
It’s easier so you don’t get too close to it.	Ya fi sauƙi don kada ku kasance kusa da shi.
But it is still moving fast.	Amma har yanzu yana tafiya da sauri.
I passed the gas station.	Na wuce gidan mai.
I don’t even know if this will reach you.	Ban ma sani ba ko wannan zai kai ku.
I know you can.	Na san za ku iya.
I'll catch you.	Zan kama.

Install this tool immediately.	Sanya wannan kayan aiki nan da nan.
I want to go home	Ina so in koma gida
There is nothing but you.	Babu komai sai kai.
I'm not sure what will happen.	Ban tabbata abin da zai faru ba.
That may not be a bad thing at all.	Wataƙila hakan ba lallai ya zama mummunan abu ba.
I never got a chance to tell him.	Ban taba samun damar fada masa ba.
We belong to people and they belong to us.	Mu daga mutane suke kuma daga gare mu suke.
And they were.	Kuma sun kasance.
He has no life.	Ba shi da wata rayuwa.
Work should be done now.	Ya kamata a yi aiki a yanzu.
Whatever the plan, do your homework ahead of time.	Ko menene shirin, yi aikin gida kafin lokaci.
I put everything in it, everything for myself.	Na saka komai a ciki, komai na kaina.
And he really loves this guy.	Kuma yana matukar son wannan mutumin.
Not much, really.	Ba yawa, da gaske.
Only child.	Yaro kawai.
Not one of those things.	Ba ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan ba.
First you.	A farko ku.
Well, for all that.	Da kyau, don duk wannan.
You will continue to feel after an activity.	Za ku ci gaba da ji bayan wani aiki.
I am not afraid of anything.	Ba na jin tsoron komai.
I did not want that to happen again.	Ban so hakan ya sake faruwa ba.
The world will never be the same again.	Duniya ba za ta ƙara zama kamar yau ba.
They are very beautiful and very well described.	Suna da kyau sosai kuma an bayyana su sosai.
It's amazing to see.	Yana da ban mamaki ganin.
And not least.	Kuma ba da kadan ba.
He did not return.	Bata dawo ba.
All of you.	Duk ku.
The train stopped.	Jirgin kasa ya tsaya.
That is coming, she knows.	Wannan yana zuwa, ta sani.
I need to know, to see.	Ina bukata in sani, in gani.
It rained a lot that day.	An yi ruwan sama mai yawa a ranar.
She felt better not showing it.	Ta ji gara ba ta nuna shi ba.
Eating and drinking are hot.	Ci da sha suna da zafi.
I am not like that either.	Ni ma ba haka nake ba.
I just love this guy.	Ina son wannan mutumin kawai.
He hit and ran home.	Ya buga da gudu gida.
I started running.	Na fara gudu.
But he must be alone.	Amma dole ne ya kasance shi kaɗai.
We can know many things.	Za mu iya sanin abubuwa da yawa.
This helps us to learn.	Wannan yana taimaka mana mu koyi.
I did it myself.	Na yi da kaina.
Then they will try to get you to buy them.	Daga nan za su yi ƙoƙari su sa ku saya su.
He was released two days later.	Bayan kwana biyu aka sake shi.
I’m so happy it doesn’t seem like it.	Ina yawan farin ciki kamar ba haka ba.
Actually she is one.	A gaskiya ita daya.
People are funny like that.	Mutane suna da ban dariya kamar haka.
I don't tell anyone.	Ba na gaya wa kowa.
But it will also be easy to explain.	Amma kuma zai zama da sauƙi a bayyana.
Always and always.	Koyaushe da kuma koyaushe.
Feels like this all came quickly.	Ji kamar wannan duk ya zo da sauri.
In time, you will.	A cikin lokaci, za ku.
So maybe not very comfortable after all.	Don haka watakila ba dadi sosai bayan duk.
I have something to prove.	Ina da abin da zan tabbatar.
It's a pleasure.	Abin farin ciki ne.
But it is not true.	Amma ba gaskiya bane.
I never thought of that.	Ban taba tunanin hakan ba.
They told him so.	Sun gaya masa haka.
This is new.	Wannan shine sabon.
But we need to do something to fix this quickly.	Amma muna buƙatar yin wani abu don gyara wannan cikin sauri.
Now it's up to you.	Yanzu ya daga kai.
And the world needs them.	Kuma duniya tana bukatar su.
That is a statement, but it may be false.	Abin da ake fada kenan, amma watakila karya ne.
They did well.	Sun yi kyau.
I like everything about it.	Ina son komai game da shi.
And they go.	Kuma suna tafiya.
Let's keep working.	Mu ci gaba da aikin.
Just call it what you want.	Kawai ku kira shi abin da kuke so.
She was.	Ta kasance.
Do not accept it.	Kar ku yarda da shi.
As he expected.	Kamar yadda ya zata.
This is food.	Wannan abinci ne.
We did not, so we could not.	Ba mu yi ba, don haka ba za mu iya ba.
Interestingly that it can take to do anything.	Abin sha'awa cewa zai iya ɗauka don yin komai.
Change it again.	Canza shi kuma.
Watch how you eat.	Kalli yadda kuke cin abinci.
Everything is in enough.	Duk abin da ke cikin isa.
Do not see.	Kada ku gani.
You have to come.	Dole ku zo.
You may even like it.	Kuna iya ma son shi.
Not all world water is fresh water.	Ba duk ruwan duniya ne ruwa mai dadi ba.
I prefer this.	Na fi son wannan.
So we came up with something using this.	Don haka mun fito da wani abu ta amfani da wannan.
He did not expect that.	Bai yi tsammanin haka ba.
The work is interesting, as you will know.	Aikin yana da ban sha'awa, kamar yadda za ku sani.
I want to forget it all.	Ina so in manta da shi duka.
It's ridiculous.	Rashin hankali ne.
It will benefit you.	Zai yi amfani da ku.
The plane is waiting.	Jirgin sama yana jira.
She was.	Ta kasance.
I was on it right away.	Ina kan shi nan take.
It should not be.	Bai kamata ya kasance ba.
She was not injured but they took her away.	Ba ta samu rauni ba amma duk da haka sun tafi da ita.
Including mine.	Ciki har da nawa.
She would not agree.	Ba za ta yarda ba.
They can help.	Za su iya taimaka.
Not after last night.	Ba bayan daren jiya ba.
I have to get back to that.	Dole ne in dawo kan wannan.
We want everyone to go happily.	Muna son kowa ya tafi da farin ciki.
He loves us very much.	Yana son mu sosai.
But only if we remove it.	Amma kawai idan mun cire shi.
I want everything to be done properly.	Ina son a yi komai yadda ya kamata.
Gradually she came back to him.	A hankali ta dawo masa.
It needs to be very good.	Yana buƙatar zama mai kyau sosai.
Mind filled her.	Hankali ya cika ta.
The room is full.	Dakin ya cika.
We can not wait anymore.	Ba za mu iya jira kuma.
We want to do the right thing.	Muna so mu yi abin da ya dace.
They are not human.	Ba mutane ba ne.
Which is amazing.	Wanda abin mamaki ne.
We have confirmed them below.	Mun tabbatar da su a kasa.
It's not very good.	Ba shi da kyau sosai.
If he can accept it.	Idan zai iya yarda da ita.
Let me work.	Bari in yi aiki.
I saw it work.	Na ga yana aiki.
We talked a lot.	Mun yi magana sosai.
But they have it in the past.	Amma suna da shi a baya.
‘The police are at a loss as to what to do.	‘Yan sanda sun rasa me za su yi.
Somewhere.	Wani wuri.
But no one raised his hand.	Amma babu wanda ya daga hannu.
It was very interesting.	Ya kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
I was the first.	Ni ne da farko.
Let's talk about it.	Bari mu yi magana game da shi.
That is our essence.	Wannan shine ainihin mu.
As it is, that did not happen.	Kamar yadda yake, hakan bai faru ba.
It makes us feel something.	Yana sa mu ji wani abu.
You probably won't remember it.	Wataƙila ba za ku tuna da shi ba.
I did not, of course.	Ban yi ba, ba shakka.
Like this, we will all grow up.	Kamar wannan, duk za mu girma.
This we did not find easy.	Wannan ba mu sami sauƙi ba.
They can't take care of you.	Ba za su iya kula da ku ba.
It applies to everyone, not just you.	Yana yi wa kowa ba kai kaɗai ba.
Although there is something.	Ko da yake akwai wani abu.
I don’t know if it is or not.	Ban sani ba ko yana da ko a'a.
The morning was fine.	Rana ta safe tana lafiya.
Repeat what he said.	Sake yin abin da ya ce.
He wants to get up.	Yana so ya tashi.
He did not tell us.	Bai gaya mana ba.
Something I would like to write.	Wani abu da zan so in rubuta.
That's fine but it does.	Wannan sosai amma ya yi.
But then she decided to find out.	Amma sai ta yanke shawarar gano hakan.
You will never leave.	Ba za ku taɓa barin ba.
There isn’t much excitement going on around here.	Ba wani farin ciki da yawa ke faruwa a kusa da nan.
Some even do it cold.	Wasu ma suna yin shi da sanyi.
I like this one.	Ina son irin wannan.
She was wrong about that.	Ta yi kuskure a kan hakan.
He never liked me.	Bai taba son ni ba.
I don’t want to think about it tonight, anymore.	Ba na son yin tunani game da shi yau da dare, ba kuma.
I'm afraid that's what we got.	Ina jin tsoron abin da muka samu ke nan.
The door is open.	Kofar gida a bude take.
It can do something like that.	Yana iya yin wani abu kamar haka.
The plane took off on time.	Jirgin ya tashi akan lokaci.
He is drinking coffee.	Yana shan kofi.
Sadly right.	Abin bakin ciki daidai ne.
But how? 	Amma ta yaya?
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
I went back upstairs.	Na koma sama.
How are you?	Komai lafiya?
However, they should not be taken lightly.	Duk da haka, ba za a ɗauki su da wasa ba.
He is here, she knows now.	Yana nan, ta sani yanzu.
On the road she was tired.	A hanya ta gaji.
It's not time to do what she wants.	Bai isa lokacin yin abubuwan da take so ba.
You must.	Dole ne ku.
We must see.	Dole ne mu gani.
He heard a cry.	Ya ji kuka.
He will be very happy.	Zai yi farin ciki sosai.
So it helped.	Don haka an taimaka.
If they are watching us.	Idan suna kallon mu.
Just feel amazing.	Kawai jin ban mamaki.
That should be the case.	Abin da ya kamata ya kasance kenan.
He filled the cup with water.	Ya cika kofi da ruwa.
Surely no one thought so.	Ya tabbata babu wanda yayi tunanin haka.
But it does.	Amma yana yi.
This plan has never been confirmed.	Ba a taɓa tabbatar da wannan shirin ba.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
He really doesn't know.	Da gaske bai sani ba.
This is one way to look at it.	Wannan hanya ɗaya ce ta kallon ta.
I only got one.	Na samu daya kawai.
I will take you where you should go.	Zan kai ku inda ya kamata ku je.
You can’t feel sad in the water.	Ba za ku iya jin bakin ciki a cikin ruwa ba.
We hope what we have given you can be useful.	Muna fatan abin da muka ba ku zai iya zama da amfani.
It's too cold.	Yayi sanyi sosai.
Think of each other.	Ka yi tunanin juna ne.
Internal use only.	Amfani na ciki kawai.
About one o'clock.	Kusan ɗaya na rana.
We did not go back.	Ba mu koma baya ba.
This is amazing, you think.	Wannan abin ban mamaki ne, kuna tunani.
The next big thing is.	Babban abu ne na gaba.
I will join.	Zan shiga.
If we stop being afraid of each other, we will stop fighting.	Idan muka daina jin tsoron juna, za mu daina fada.
They provide for her needs at home.	Suna ba ta abin da gida ke bukata.
It was good for us.	Ya yi mana kyau.
Imagine staying with me for one night only.	Ka yi tunanin ka zauna tare da ni dare ɗaya kawai.
Why this time.	Me yasa wannan lokacin.
That sounds like intelligence.	Hakan ya zama kamar hankali.
It feels like a problem.	Yana jin kamar matsala.
This worked fine.	Wannan yayi aiki daidai.
Never try to tell me what to do.	Kar ku taɓa gwada gaya mani abin da zan yi.
All over the world.	Duk duniya.
Not much growing out of here.	Ba yawa girma daga nan.
It worked for me.	Ya yi min aiki.
So, there is no talking to anyone.	Don haka, babu magana da kowa.
This can go anyway.	Wannan na iya tafiya ko ta yaya.
I don't see anyone.	Ban ga kowa ba.
There is no single way to get there.	Babu hanya guda don isa wurin.
We buy like everyone else.	Muna saya kamar kowa.
The goods are near.	Kayan suna kusa.
I don't have it.	Ba ni da shi.
If she leaves, there are others.	Idan ta tafi, akwai wasu.
No one pretended to die.	Ba wanda ya yi kamar zai mutu.
She said.	Ta ce.
That feels right.	Wannan yana jin daidai.
Am I a true story?	Ni labarin gaskiya ne?
An amazing book will always sell in the end.	Littafin ban mamaki koyaushe zai sayar a ƙarshe.
Maybe two months.	Watakila wata biyu.
It can not be.	Ba zai iya zama ba.
Everyone looked at the door.	Kowa ya kalli kofar.
Prepare the food carefully.	Shirya abincin a hankali.
Such later.	Irin wannan daga baya.
For some maybe things are getting better outside.	Shin, ga wasu watakila abubuwa suna samun kyau a waje.
Many things can go wrong.	Abubuwa da yawa na iya yin tafiya ba daidai ba.

They are the ones who will change the world.	Su ne za su canza duniya.
Now this is a development.	Yanzu wannan ci gaba ne.
But I'm not sure.	Amma ban tabbata ba.
I worked in it, though.	Na yi aiki a ciki, ko da yake.
I know what these are.	Na san yadda waɗannan suke.
I do not do things like that.	Ba na yin abubuwa kamar haka.
Someone who changed.	Wani wanda ya canza.
I'm not sleeping.	Ba barci nake yi ba.
We are not even finished.	Ba ma kare ba.
I shouldn’t be too much on the road.	Kada in kasance sosai a cikin hanya.
So far without success.	Ya zuwa yanzu ba tare da nasara ba.
But not too much.	Amma ba yawa sosai.
I have two others.	Ina da wasu biyu.
This is very difficult for me.	Wannan yana da matukar wahala a gare ni.
He is there now.	Yana can yanzu.
I can see you from here.	Ina iya ganin ku daga nan.
When the job is done, show it.	Lokacin da aikin ya gama, nuna shi.
More than external.	Fiye da na waje.
There is a way for everyone.	Akwai hanya ga kowa da kowa.
He worked for a while.	Ya yi aiki na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Get out and go inside.	Fita kuma a ciki.
We are really happy to have you.	Gaskiya mun yi farin ciki da samun ku.
Where too much to take.	Inda ya yi yawa don ɗauka.
But not everyone agrees.	Amma ba kowa ne ya yarda da wannan tunanin ba.
Maybe one day there will be time.	Wataƙila wata rana za a sami lokaci.
He hasn't done anything yet.	Bai yi komai ba tukuna.
I think you can make it that way.	Ina tsammanin za ku iya sanya shi haka.
But he did not get it.	Amma bai samu ba.
This is where she grew up and where she lives.	A nan ne ta girma da kuma inda take zaune.
It's simple and works.	Yana da sauƙi kuma yana aiki.
So forget about hearing.	Don haka manta game da ji.
I tell people to drink plenty of water.	Ina gaya wa mutane su sha ruwa mai yawa.
Now come.	Yanzu zo.
But definitely a good player.	Amma tabbas ɗan wasa mai kyau.
Only slowly walking together.	Kawai a hankali yana tafiya tare.
Some are very good.	Wasu suna da kyau sosai.
You know better.	Kun fi sani.
This is something.	Wannan wani abu ne.
It belongs to me.	Ya zama nawa.
We realized that the program would not work.	Mun gane cewa shirin ba zai yi aiki ba.
She is not well.	Ba ta da lafiya.
We will kill you, if you touch me.	Za mu kashe ka, idan har ka taba ni.
Or make sure someone does.	Ko kuma tabbatar da cewa wani ya yi.
It's just a place to sit and think.	Wuri ne kawai ya zauna yayi tunani.
He also saw.	Shi ma ya gani.
He did not lose heart.	Bai bata rai ba.
Maybe she still does.	Wataƙila har yanzu tana yi.
I will be happy when he comes back safe and sound.	Zan yi farin ciki idan ya dawo lafiya.
What does he do.	Me yake yi.
Maybe that's why he was saved.	Watakila shi ya sa aka ajiye masa.
It will be exactly as you said.	Zai kasance daidai kamar yadda kuka faɗa.
Please, bring them back to me.	Don Allah, don Allah a dawo mini da su.
What he did was not impressive.	Abin da ya yi bai kasance mai ban sha'awa ba.
Including the length of time he spent there.	Ciki har da tsawon lokacin da ya yi a wurin nan.
We all know him, right away.	Mu duka mun san shi, nan da nan.
I came back to tell you that.	Na dawo ne in gaya muku haka.
Now he prefers to know.	Yanzu ya fi son sani.
Sorry, but can't be helped.	Yi hakuri, amma ba za a iya taimaka ba.
They talk about it.	Suna magana game da shi.
It is good to see you.	Yana da kyau ganin ku.
The water tasted good.	Ruwan ya ji daɗi.
We have food.	Muna da abinci.
This was not done.	Ba a yi haka ba.
She seemed to be working.	Ta yi kamar ta yi aiki.
It's even better.	Ya ma fi kyau.
When you walk, walk.	Lokacin da kuke tafiya, tafiya.
He cried for me.	Ya yi min kuka.
Call me if you are interested.	Kira ni idan kuna sha'awar.
We look forward to seeing you.	Muna fatan ganin ku.
You do what you can.	Kuna yin abin da za ku iya.
We were in this.	Mun kasance cikin wannan.
The timing was always good.	Lokacin ko da yaushe ya yi kyau.
Now nothing is going to happen.	Yanzu babu wani abu da zai faru.
We laughed a lot.	Muna dariya sosai.
And now, he loves it.	Kuma yanzu, yana son shi.
I hope it rises.	Ina fatan ya tashi.
Wondering what's going on right now.	Mamakin me yake ciki yanzu.
If anything, things went the other way.	Idan wani abu, abubuwa sun tafi ta wata hanya.
Now help me here.	Yanzu ka taimake ni a nan.
We have some time together.	Muna da ɗan lokaci tare.
There is only one.	Akwai daya kawai.
We women are talking.	Mu mata muna magana.
He is behind you.	Yana bayan ku.
And it's very early.	Kuma yana da wuri sosai.
Their car needs repair.	Motar su tana bukatar gyara.
Sometimes people say it's just intelligence.	Wani lokaci mutane suna cewa hankali ne kawai.
As far as my head, my head.	Har zuwa kai na, kai na.
Yet he knew it.	Amma duk da haka ya san da shi.
The truth is good.	Gaskiya yayi kyau.
No new ideas.	Babu sabon tunani.
I can see you for what you really are.	Zan iya ganin ku don ainihin abin da kuke.
She wanted me to tell you.	Ta so in gaya maka.
The house stood empty.	Gidan ya tsaya babu kowa.
They are used, and we must keep that in mind.	Ana amfani da su, kuma dole ne mu tuna da hakan.
I'll leave you with them.	Zan bar ku da su.
The food is very good.	Abincin yana da kyau sosai.
It is better not to worry.	Zai fi kyau kada ku damu.
I would have been with you no matter what.	Da na kasance a wurin ku komai.
Never before.	Ba a taɓa ba da wuri ba.
It further goes out of your way.	Ya kara fita daga hanyar ku.
I know how things were for you later.	Na san yadda abubuwa suka kasance a gare ku daga baya.
The food and water were delicious.	Abinci da ruwa sun kasance suna jin daɗi.
Did you play.	Shin kun yi wasa.
What we do know is that they are real.	Abin da muka sani shi ne cewa suna da gaske.
She owes him money.	Ta bashi kudi.
Since that thought came back, she could not say.	Tun yaushe wannan tunanin ya dawo, ta kasa cewa.
They joined together.	Suka shiga tare.
It is three o'clock.	Lokaci yanzu karfe uku ne.
I want to help, he said.	Ina so in taimaka, in ji shi.
So how to do it.	Don haka yadda za a yi.
Make time to eat healthy.	Yi lokaci don cin abinci mai kyau.
Good food.	Abinci mai kyau.
But they called us tomorrow.	Amma sun kira mu gobe.
I do not know what he has, but he does not care.	Ban san abin da yake da shi ba, amma bai damu ba.
We all know you are not good.	Mu duka mun san ba ku da kyau.
This is better.	Wannan ya fi kyau.
So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution.	Ya zuwa yanzu babu wanda ya samu ko daya.
We stopped and talked for a while.	Muka tsaya muna magana na dan wani lokaci.
I told him he would come tomorrow.	Na ce masa gobe zai zo.
No one knows what will happen to him.	Ba wanda ya san abin da zai faru da shi.
But it is definitely a surprise.	Amma tabbas abin mamaki ne.
They are just there to work.	Suna nan kawai don yin aiki.
But still he did not lie to me.	Amma duk da haka tabbas bai yi min karya ba.
But even then, it still didn’t work.	Amma ko bayan haka, har yanzu bai yi aiki ba.
Do your best.	Yi aiki mafi kyau.
But the problem is close.	Amma matsala ta kusa.
I am working tomorrow.	Ina aiki gobe.
But if we all agree.	Amma idan duk mun yarda.
He replied that he did not call them.	Ya amsa da cewa bai kira su ba.
We only played together twice a month.	Mun yi wasa tare sau biyu kawai a wata.
He thought she would be at the party.	Ya yi tsammanin za ta kasance a wurin bikin.
He gave it a little, but not much.	Ya ɗan ba shi, amma ba yawa.
The water is comfortable now.	Ruwan yana jin daɗi yanzu.
There is certainly no truth in this.	Ko shakka babu gaskiya a cikin wannan.
He could have something there.	Zai iya samun wani abu a can.
We never talked to each other.	Ba mu taba magana da juna ba.
But you have to walk before you can run.	Amma sai ka yi tafiya kafin ka iya gudu.
It can be very useful for you.	Zai iya zama da amfani sosai a gare ku.
That's right.	Hakan yayi daidai.
Knowledge comes when it is called.	Sanin yana zuwa idan an kira shi.
We are suffering.	Muna shan wahala.
People did not even come near us.	Mutane ma ba su zo kusa da mu ba.
I did not want to let him go.	Ban so in bar shi ya tafi ba.
He would not ask for such a thing.	Ba zai nemi irin wannan abu ba.
They could not walk or talk.	Ba su iya tafiya ko magana ba.
Are you sleeping well tonight?	Kuna barci lafiya a daren nan?
It may be as you say.	Yana iya zama kamar yadda kuka ce.
The gains are growing.	Abubuwan da ake samu suna girma.
It is truly a comfortable home to live in.	A gaskiya gida ne mai dadi don zama.
She sighed as she sat up.	Ta fad'a a zaune.
But it is still not available.	Amma har yanzu ba a samu ba.
And nothing.	Kuma ba komai.
I feel like she is still asleep.	Ina jin har yanzu barci take yi.
We were never made to feel we were on the road.	Ba a taba sa mu ji muna kan hanya ba.
It helped me keep things simple.	Ya taimake ni ci gaba da abubuwa.
They will be opened, ”she said.	Za a bude su," in ji ta.
The dress goes unnoticed.	Rigar tana tafiya babu kowa a ciki.
But to no avail.	Amma ba wani amfani.
In fact, we once went in, as they say.	A gaskiya ma, mun taɓa shiga ciki, kamar yadda suke faɗa.
Not at home.	Bata a gida.
She was upset again.	Ta sake bata rai.
Very well indeed.	Da kyau lallai.
And surprisingly, he is not dead.	Kuma abin mamaki shi ne bai mutu ba.
He would have done that.	Da yayi haka.
Another busy month!	Wani wata mai aiki!
And that is not at all healthy.	Kuma hakan ba shi da lafiya ko kadan.
I thought many times.	Na yi tunani sau da yawa.
One thing is wrong with it.	Abu daya bata da kyau a kai.
Two years of hard work, and they are still being enjoyed.	Shekaru biyu na amfani mai wahala, kuma har yanzu ana jin daɗin su.
Eventually these stopped.	A ƙarshe waɗannan sun tsaya.
She could not leave.	Ba za ta iya barin ba.
Absolutely.	Babu shakka.
Talk to someone.	Yi magana da wani.
I will come tomorrow.	Zan zo nan gobe.
But let me tell you something.	Amma bari in gaya muku wani abu.
It was completely cut off.	Gaba daya aka yanke shi.
Everything is coming to an end.	Duk abubuwa sun zo ƙarshe.
It's nothing.	Ba komai ba ne.
It can even help.	Zai iya ma taimaka.
Of course, this is not true.	Tabbas hakan ba gaskiya bane.
It has more opportunities.	Yana da ƙarin dama.
Night closed during the day.	Dare rufe a ranar.
The game is over.	Wasan ya kare.
Please do not come here.	Fatan ba sai kun zo nan ba.
To go to this place.	Don zuwa wannan wuri.
I do not know how it happened.	Ban san yadda hakan ya faru ba.
I leave home now.	Na bar gida yanzu.
However, it still has some disadvantages.	Duk da haka, har yanzu yana da wasu rashin amfani.
The house is still empty.	Gidan har yanzu babu kowa.
It will be operational next week.	A mako mai zuwa ne zai fara aiki.
So we don’t.	Don haka ba ma yi.
Read a few more things.	Karanta wasu 'yan wasu abubuwa kuma.
It was the only house they knew.	Shi ne kawai gidan da suka sani.
At the time, it would be.	A lokacin, zai kasance.
It never flew again.	Bata sake tashi ba.
It's close, so it fits really well.	Yana kusa, don haka ya dace sosai.
We are together day and night.	Muna tare da juna dare da rana.
It doesn't matter.	Bata damu ba.
He kept coming.	Ya ci gaba da zuwa.
It seems to be good for people.	Ga alama yana da kyau ga mutane.
However, we feel that it is not good.	Duk da haka, muna jin cewa ba shi da kyau.
I've been badly injured.	An yi mini rauni da yawa.
I like it like that.	Ina son shi kamar haka.
Everything will come right in the end.	Duk zai zo daidai a ƙarshe.
You just have to prove it.	Kai kawai ka tabbatar da hakan.
They have everything.	Suna da komai.
The flight attendant was not present at the time.	Mai jirgin ba ya nan a lokacin.
It is still the same thing.	Har yanzu abu daya ne.
I see why you and he work together so well.	Na ga dalilin da ya sa ku da shi aiki tare da kyau.
I heard there was a problem coming.	Na ji akwai matsala ta zo.
I have a cold.	Na yi sanyi.
I have to be there.	Dole ne in kasance a wurin.
They did a great job on that.	Sun yi kyakkyawan aiki akan hakan.
But how do you do that.	Amma yaya kuke yin hakan.
Anyone who does not agree just does not understand.	Duk wanda bai yarda ba kawai bai gane ba.
You cry slowly.	Kuka yayi a hankali.
More than that happened.	Fiye da haka ya faru.
That made my day.	Wannan ya sanya rana ta.
Our decision was unanimous.	Shawarar mu ta kasance gaba ɗaya.
Is there a.	Akwai wani.
It never was.	Bai taba kasance ba.
The rest will not.	Sauran ba za su yi ba.
Everything is fine, everything is fine.	Duk yayi kyau, komai yayi kyau.
It's a lot bigger.	Ya fi girma da yawa.
It was done.	An yi shi.
I decided to check it out later at home.	Na yanke shawarar duba shi daga baya a gida.
I have not yet decided whether to go or not.	Har yanzu ban yanke shawarar ko zan tafi ko a'a ba.
And keep doing it.	Kuma ku ci gaba da yi.
Nothing now.	Babu komai yanzu.
This makes debt a good financial tool.	Wannan ya sa bashi ya zama kayan aikin kuɗi mai kyau.
As you yourself can.	Kamar yadda ku da kanku iya.
It never happened to me to do that.	Ban ma taba faruwa gare ni yin hakan ba .
At the end of the day, he heard two more.	A karshen ranar, ya sake jin wasu biyu.
It really bothered him to know the truth.	Sosai ya bata masa rai sanin gaskiya.
They will not be missed.	Ba za a rasa su ba.
Some agree that it was written, but not all.	Wasu sun yarda cewa an rubuta, amma ba duka ba.
You are children, it will pass, or you will change from it.	Kun kasance yara, zai wuce, ko za ku canza daga gare ta.
They are just beautiful.	Suna da kyau kawai.
He is a man in the morning.	Mutum ne da safe.
He was great, though.	Ya kasance mai girma, ko da yake.
It's really almost kind of amazing.	Yana da gaske kusan irin ban mamaki.
After two months no one knew where he was.	Bayan wata biyu babu wanda ya san inda yake.
I'm sure they like it.	Na tabbata suna son shi.
Just for the moment.	Kawai don lokacin.
Since then I have been running.	Tun daga nan nake gudu.
I was worried about my health about them.	Na damu da rashin lafiya game da su.
Enough.	Ya isa.
He could not go on.	Ba zai iya ci gaba ba.
This is not necessarily a good thing.	Wannan ba lallai ba abu ne mai kyau ba.
When you need it.	Lokacin da kuke bukata.
The first thing they do is make money with it.	Abu na farko da suke yi shine samun kuɗi da shi.
She was small.	Ta kasance kadan.
Let's start with one you can answer.	Bari mu fara da daya za ku iya ba da amsa.
I accept.	Na yarda.
Hopefully, one of the owners.	Da fatan, daya daga cikin masu shi.
Don't believe it.	Kar ku yarda da ita.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
Maybe they are better.	Wataƙila sun fi kyau.
Not true.	Ba gaskiya bane.
The world of the world.	Duniya na duniya.
We would have found a way.	Da mun sami hanya.
Or even dinner.	Ko ma abincin dare.
We will not get a second chance.	Ba za mu sami dama ta biyu ba.
I can tell you what to do with it.	Zan iya gaya muku abin da za ku yi da hakan.
That would be nice.	Da yayi kyau.
In fact, we would love it.	A gaskiya, za mu so shi.
Who does not care.	Wanda bai damu ba.
Everyone has a right.	Kowa yana da dama.
This is so much more than music.	Wannan ya fi waƙa sosai.
I think he doesn't want to fly.	Ina ganin baya son tashi.
You do not know what you have there.	Ba ku san abin da kuke da shi a can ba.
It will not happen.	Ba zai faru ba.
I don't want to see it used.	Ba na son ganin an yi amfani da shi.
We are closed !.	Mun rufe!.
No problem finding the location.	Babu matsala gano wurin.
First one out.	Na farko daya fita.
She didn't find anyone.	Ba ta sami kowa ba.
Have you ever seen one before?	Shin ka taba ganin daya a baya?
He did not answer.	Bai amsa ba.
She will never love you.	Ba za ta taɓa son ka ba.
Need help.	Bukatar taimako.
I am no longer a person.	Ni ba ma mutum ba ne kuma.
And this is not the only time that has happened.	Kuma ba wannan ne kawai lokacin da abin ya faru ba.
He appears to have failed.	Ya bayyana ya kasa.
You write because you must.	Kuna rubuta saboda dole ne ku.
They made sure we were taken care of.	Sun tabbatar an kula da mu.
I remember him.	Na tuna shi.
They can do this.	Za su iya yin wannan.
Outside the room.	Waje dakin.
I do not know exactly where he is, he said.	Ban san ainihin inda yake ba, in ji shi.
I want to stay here too.	Ina son zama a nan kuma.
They were very close.	Sun kasance kusa sosai.
We'll see how this goes.	Za mu ga yadda wannan ke tafiya.
Not specified.	Ba a bayyana ba.
Sometimes they can be useful.	Wani lokaci suna iya zama da amfani.
It was time and time was not on.	Lokaci ya kasance kuma lokaci bai yi ba.
You may have seen some strange things.	Wataƙila kun ga wasu abubuwan ban mamaki.
I know nothing about it.	Ban san komai game da shi ba.
Fighting also didn't get him anywhere.	Fada shi ma bai kai shi ko ina ba.
He has nothing to do with it.	Ba shi da aiki da ita.
But no one seems to know where he is.	Amma da alama babu wanda ya san inda yake.
I knew he would make an interesting reading.	Na san zai yi karatu mai ban sha'awa.
At first this may be a little surprising.	Da farko wannan yana iya zama ɗan mamaki.
Maybe he is a man after all.	Wataƙila shi mutum ne bayan duk.
She is the best.	Ita ce mafi kyau.
For a little.	Don kadan.
Or even prove it.	Ko ma ya tabbatar.
If you've been here, you know.	Idan kun kasance a nan, kun sani.
Fail at one.	Kasa a daya.
It's amazing.	Abin mamaki ne.
I want to help you celebrate.	Ina so in taimake ku bikin.
From there, let's add.	Daga can, bari mu ƙara.
It's bigger than that.	Ya fi haka girma.
He was killed.	An kashe shi.
But we can do something about it.	Amma za mu iya yin wani abu game da wannan.
I have never heard of you.	Har yanzu ban taba jin labarin ku ba.
And she doesn't always do that.	Kuma ba ta yin haka kullum.
Now that is the problem.	Yanzu wannan ita ce matsalar.
Only cold water.	Ruwan sanyi kawai.
Take care of it.	Kula da shi.
I am not ready for this.	Ban shirya don wannan ba.
I didn’t turn off the place, though.	Ban kashe wurin ba, ko da yake.
He has to get up.	Dole ya tashi.
We just don’t have time to laugh.	Kawai ba mu da lokacin yin dariya.
Now go as fast as you can.	Yanzu tafi da sauri kamar yadda za ku iya.
She didn't see anything about it.	Ba ta ga wani abu game da shi ba.
Do the work.	Yi aikin.
Someone she knows.	Wani ta sani.
It's too cold, anyway.	Yayi sanyi sosai, ko ta yaya.
I'll give it a go.	Zan ba shi tafi.
It can be very difficult.	Yana iya zama da wahala sosai.
Of course, it should not be so.	Tabbas, bai kamata ya kasance haka ba.
My reservation is complete.	Ajiye na ya cika.
And we will continue to do so.	Kuma za mu ci gaba da yin haka.
The train left the station quickly.	Jirgin ya bar tashar da sauri.
If so you can call it that.	Idan haka ne za ku iya kira shi.
It was difficult then.	Yana da wuya a lokacin.
I haven't heard anything about it, to this day.	Ban ji komai ba game da ita, har yau.
Girls don’t wear that kind of thing.	'Yan mata ba sa sa irin wannan.
I really want to get this game.	Ina matukar son samun wannan wasan.
I am open to you completely.	Na bude muku gaba daya.
We'll start with both.	Za mu fara da duka.
We do not have to wait.	Ba sai mun jira ba.
That's why they may not be with you.	Shi ya sa watakila ba su nan tare da ku.
Obviously they were never left in the lurch.	Babu shakka ba a taɓa barin su cikin abubuwa ba.
Or maybe because of it.	Ko watakila saboda shi.
I love him.	Ina son shi.
Sorry wet.	Yi hakuri da rigar.
It does not go fast.	Ba ya tafiya da sauri.
But this game is difficult.	Amma wannan wasan yana da wahala.
The landlord had the house renovated.	Mai gidan ya sa aka gyara gidan.
We should do our best.	Ya kamata mu yi mafi kyau.
Let me bring it to you quickly.	Bari in kawo muku da sauri.
Everything he wanted, well, he didn’t get.	Duk abin da yake so, da kyau, bai samu ba.
We took everything they agreed.	Mun dauki duk abin da suka yarda.
I'm tired of this game.	Na gaji da wannan wasan.
And it is something that is not usually seen.	Kuma abu ne da ba a saba gani ba.
Truth.	Gaskiya.
There will be things to do.	Za a yi abubuwan da za a yi.
He didn't really care.	Bai damu da gaske ba.
Each day is more about what that will be.	Kowace rana ya fi bayyana abin da hakan zai kasance.
He does not belong to them.	Ba ya zama da su.
You have to start somewhere.	Dole ku fara wani wuri.
You said nothing.	Ba ka ce komai ba.
Of course I agree that life must go on.	Tabbas na yarda cewa dole ne rayuwa ta ci gaba.
I know him, of course.	Na san shi, ba shakka.
He did not answer for a long time.	Ya dade bai amsa ba.
Not comfortable or convenient.	Ba dadi ko dace ba.
But whatever it is, it will not stand on your own.	Amma duk abin da yake, ba zai tsaya a kan ku ba.
He never went home.	Bai taba zuwa gida ba.
I do not think this is true.	Bana jin wannan gaskiya ne.
It's just a game you really know.	Wasan ne kawai da kuke sanin su da gaske.
I do not have it for you.	Ba ni da kai gare shi.
They want me, you see.	Sun so ni, ka gani.
Continue fast.	Ci gaba da sauri.
It's hard to find.	Yana da wuya a samu.
It would not have surprised me.	Da bai bani mamaki ba.
It's time to dump her.	Lokacin tafiya yayi.
She never said anything about this when we first joined.	Ba ta taɓa cewa komai game da wannan ba lokacin da muka fara shiga.
I think that's fun!	Ina tsammanin hakan yana da daɗi!
This is what you came for.	Wannan shi ne abin da kuka zo.
Never made a name for itself.	Ba a taɓa yin suna ba.
He took care of himself when he died.	Ya kula da kansa lokacin da ya mutu.
I think it's interesting too.	Ina tsammanin yana da ban sha'awa kuma.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
We have to go to work tomorrow.	Dole ne mu tafi aiki gobe.
I want to keep hearing.	Ina so in ci gaba da ji na.
Wait a moment.	Jira na ɗan lokaci.
It is a way of life.	Hanya ce ta rayuwa.
See you tomorrow.	Sai gobe.
I want to help others.	Ina so in taimaka wa wasu.
Some things are not forgotten.	Wasu abubuwa ba a manta da su ba.
You work harder.	Kun ƙara yin aiki.
I do not know how she did it.	Ban san yadda ta yi ba.
Everything is, and is everything.	Komai shi ne, kuma shi ne komai.
She was fine.	Ta kasance lafiya.
Why in the world is it so difficult.	Me yasa a duniya yana da wahala sosai.
You must finish.	Dole ne ku gama.
If you live there and you do not like it, leave.	Idan kana zaune a can kuma ba ka son shi, bar.
They hope to get it in time.	Sun yi fatan su samu cikin lokaci.
No, it is not there.	A'a, babu can.
We will let you go home.	Za mu bar ku ku tafi gida.
I know every dog ​​by name.	Na san kowane kare da suna.
I think one needs to think for oneself.	Ina tsammanin mutum yana buƙatar yin tunanin kansa.
I enjoyed not being around her.	Na ji daɗin rashin zama kusa da ita.
It's hard, though.	Yana da wuya, ko da yake.
No, here they are.	A'a, ga su nan kuma.
I do not know what to say.	Ban san me zan ce ba.
We set off on the road.	Muka tashi kan hanya.
So far he has only bought one drink.	Ya zuwa yanzu ya sayi abin sha daya ne kawai.
Apparently everyone is worried about her now.	Da alama kowa ya damu da ita yanzu.
No, that will not work.	A'a, hakan ba zai yi aiki ba.
It's all funny.	Duk abin dariya ne.
It's fine, though.	Yana da kyau, ko da yake.
I think it is.	Ina tsammanin shi ne.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
It's very interesting.	Yayi ban sha'awa sosai.
Like they can do or not something big.	Kamar za su iya yi ko ba wani babban abu ba ne.
I wondered if she was tired again.	Na yi tunanin ko ta gaji kuma.
I tried some things, but they were on the way.	Na gwada wasu abubuwa, amma sun kasance a hanya.
He is a god.	Shi allah ne.
We used to enjoy that.	Mun kasance muna jin daɗin hakan.
There is still time to do something.	Har yanzu akwai sauran lokacin yin wani abu.
If you do, you will pay.	Idan kun yi, za ku biya.
They just look at each other.	Kallon juna kawai suke yi.
I'll finish now.	Zan gama yanzu.
That would be too much.	Hakan zai yi yawa.
This is amazing.	Wannan yana da ban mamaki.
The findings will not be genuine.	Abin da aka samu ba zai zama na gaske ba.
It was found to be flawed.	An gano cewa ba ta da kyau.
I hope to finish soon.	Ina fatan in gama da wuri.
He knocked and the door opened.	Ya buga kofar ya bude.
This pair has both.	Wannan biyu yana da duka biyu.
You see how difficult it is to come here.	Kun ga yadda wahala ta zo nan.
Many things happen today.	Abubuwa da yawa sun faru a yau.
Maybe you will be fine then.	Wataƙila za ku kasance lafiya a lokacin.
I hope that is.	Ina fatan hakan ya kasance.
This is appropriate.	Wannan ya dace.
It started to rain.	Nan take aka fara ruwan sama.
He knew it would happen.	Ya san zai faru.
He will not play.	Ba zai yi wasa ba.
He is accustomed to the cold now.	Ya saba sanyi a yanzu.
I am very happy with it.	Ina matukar farin ciki da shi.
He sits next to me, we talk a little bit sometimes.	Ya na zaune kusa da ni, muna magana kadan wani lokaci.
The night is gone.	Daren da zai tafi.
I stopped using it again.	Na daina amfani da shi kuma.
That sounds like a big deal.	Hakan ya ji kamar babban abu.
The process is slow and fast.	Hanyar tana da hankali da sauri.
I know you are right.	Na san tabbas kana da gaskiya.
No one cares what you think.	Babu wanda ya damu da abin da kuke tunani.
You can join us !.	Kuna iya shiga mu!.
He protected the weak.	Ya kare masu rauni.
He still plays it well though.	Har yanzu yana buga shi da kyau duk da haka.
That will not happen today.	Hakan ba zai faru ba a yau.
But not for me.	Amma ba don ni ba.
I have never seen such a thing in many, many years.	Ban taba ganin irin wannan abu a cikin shekaru da yawa, da yawa.
Please go here.	Da fatan za a je nan.
I feel very comfortable.	Ina jin dadi sosai.
I have to make them pay.	Dole ne in sa su biya.
However, they seemed to be able to do something.	Duk da haka, sun zama kamar za su iya yin wani abu.
He was very weak.	Ya kasance mai rauni sosai.
Do not try this at home.	Kar a gwada wannan a gida.
Happy to help.	Farin cikin yin taimako.
I said they were doing it.	Na ce suna yin shi.
But he is very tired.	Amma ya gaji sosai.
He is a beautiful boy.	Wani kyakkyawan yaro ne.
At that moment the game began.	A wannan lokacin wasan ya fara.
That changed her day.	Wannan ya canza rana ta.
Then she realized they couldn't.	Sai ta gane ba za su iya ba.
You talk fast.	Kuna magana da sauri.
It is my favorite drink.	Abin sha ne na fi so.
How to say.	Yadda ake fada.
There is nothing but you.	Babu wani abu sai kai.
Nothing was given.	Babu wani abu da aka ba.
I'm not sure what can be done.	Ban tabbata abin da za a iya yi ba.
It's kind of a fast way.	Yana da irin sauri hanya.
This makes them even more happy.	Hakan ya sa su kara jin dadi.
If you like, you can check these out.	Idan kuna so, kuna iya duba waɗannan.
The thing is that it is not something.	Abu shine abin da yake ba wani abu ba.
No answer.	Babu amsa.
They don't want anything in this place.	Ba su son komai da wannan wuri.
I will be here even if he does.	Zan kasance a nan ko da ya yi.
That is better than life.	Cewa ya fi rayuwa.
I know it's early, but we have to go.	Na san yana da wuri, amma dole mu tafi.
Little progress has been made.	An samu ci gaba kadan.
The discomfort was amazing.	Rashin jin daɗi ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
Or maybe he can’t get it.	Ko watakila ba zai iya samu ba.
They only apply it to a person when he dies.	Suna amfani da shi akan mutum kawai idan ya mutu.
Not a man's house.	Ba gidan mutum ba.
Out of everything, it brings something.	Daga cikin komai, yana kawo wani abu.
A simple statement of truth.	Magana mai sauƙi na gaskiya.
I do nothing.	Ba na yin komai.
She loves it so much.	Tana son shi sosai.
After a while he started to fly.	Bayan wani lokaci ya fara tashi.
You will not accept this.	Ba za ku yarda da wannan ba.
And he can get it.	Kuma zai iya samu.
We tried to find a place to stay.	Mun yi ƙoƙarin samun wuri mu zauna.
You can tell him yesterday or in the morning.	Kuna iya gaya masa jiya ko da safe.
I want to be the best.	Ina so in zama mafi kyau.
I want them to know that.	Ina so su san hakan.
She used to eat lunch.	Ta kasance tana cin abincin rana.
They should not do this.	Kada su yi haka.
You know in others.	Ka sani a wasu.
Talk to you.	Magana da ku.
You feel now.	Kuna ji yanzu.
When should we expect you?	Yaushe ya kamata mu yi tsammanin ku?
It makes me feel better.	Yana sa ni jin lafiya.
What has never been seen is never seen.	Abin da aka taɓa gani ba a taɓa gani ba.
I think it happens a little bit every day.	Ina ganin yana faruwa kadan kadan kowace rana.
I like driving	Ina son tuƙi
I want to talk to you today if you are close.	Ina so in yi magana da ku a yau idan kuna kusa.
He fills nothing with himself but wants something better.	Ba abin da ya cika kansa sai son wani abu mafi kyau.
Just try cold.	Kawai gwada sanyi.
It will just go down so low.	Kawai zai yi kasa sosai.
She did it.	Ta yi shi.
That's what's there for you.	Abin da yake can don haka ke nan.
Although she does not use it regularly.	Ko da yake ba ta amfani da shi kullum.
She could not understand.	Ta kasa gane.
He can tell.	Zai iya fada.
Sometimes they feel uncomfortable.	Wani lokaci suna jin rashin jin daɗi.
But it is not right.	Amma ba daidai yake ba.
It all went well.	An yi nasara duka.
In fact, it is still in use today.	A gaskiya ma, har yanzu ana amfani da shi a yau.
They did just that when the time came.	Haka suka yi daidai lokacin da lokaci ya yi.
I love it all, love it.	Ina son shi duka, son shi.
Of course it does.	Tabbas yana yi.
We don't want trouble.	Ba mu son matsala.
It was a feeling he never expected to get.	Wannan ji ne da bai taba tsammanin zai samu ba.
You know very little you can see.	Kun san kadan za ku iya gani.
I am happy now.	Ina farin ciki yanzu.
I had to stand in two.	Dole na tsaya a biyu.
I have to sign up now.	Dole ne in shiga yanzu.
It's weird and scary.	Abu ne mai ban sha'awa kuma abin ban tsoro.
From somewhere.	Daga wani wuri.
So that's what we do.	Don haka abin da muke yi ke nan.
We will do it.	Za mu yi shi.
I’ve never seen anything do exactly what it does.	Ban taba ganin wani abu ya yi daidai abin da yake yi ba.
He was a child.	Ya kasance yaro.
We'll see what she has.	Za mu ga abin da take da shi.
He was a great man to work with.	Ya kasance babban mutum don yin aiki.
I was not told where they were taken.	Ba a ba ni labarin inda aka kai su ba.
Sit down.	Zaune take.
Something was there.	Wani abu ya kasance a can.
Whatever your best work ethic, you are doing it.	Ko menene mafi kyawun aikin ku, kuna yin shi.
He will not die.	Ba zai mutu ba.
This was for the best.	Wannan ya kasance don mafi kyau.
That may be correct.	Hakan na iya zama daidai.
I'm waiting for him to say something.	Ina jira ya ce wani abu.
At first he saw nothing.	Da farko bai ga komai ba.
It is very difficult.	Yana da matukar wahala.
I would be happy if they brought it out.	Zan ji daɗi idan sun fito da shi.
And we have no children.	Kuma ba mu da yara.
They are not afraid.	Ba tsoro ba ne.
Something, someone else was there with her.	Wani abu, wani yana can tare da ita.
It's exciting, though.	Abin farin ciki ne, ko da yake.
This is understood.	An fahimci wannan.
Kids playing outside.	Yara suna wasa a waje.
We must stand up for what we hate.	Dole ne mu tsaya a aikin da muke ƙi.
I don't have to remember them now.	Bai kamata in tuna da su ba a yanzu.
It would have killed us a lot.	Da ya kashe mu da yawa.
It's cold outside.	Yayi sanyi a waje.
You will see yourself as you are.	Za ku ga kanku kamar yadda kuke.
It's too hot.	Yayi zafi sosai.
Some would say that this is incorrect.	Wasu za su ce wannan ba daidai ba ne.
He could not know anything about this.	Bai iya sanin komai game da wannan ba.
They bought it just because they could afford it.	Sun saya ne kawai don suna iya biya.
This is true.	Wannan gaskiya ne.
He did not find any.	Bai sami ko ɗaya ba.
Exactly you.	Daidai da ku.
They can not see.	Ba za su iya gani ba.
They were interested at first.	Sun kasance masu sha'awar da farko.
I am still here.	Ina nan har yanzu.
Of course, you can go out and buy one.	Tabbas, kuna iya fita ku sayi ɗaya.
But one day they finished everything.	Amma wata rana da suka gama komai.
That seems like nobody understands.	Abin da kamar babu wanda ya gane ke nan.
We never gave up on you.	Ba mu taba ba da kai ba.
So do not be about.	Don haka kada ku kasance game da.
Call it a drink.	Kira shi abin sha.
They will do it with each other.	Za su yi da juna.
It's better than you say.	Ya fi yadda kuke cewa.
In the morning they came.	Da safe suka zo.
I came home.	Na dawo gida.
No time to remove it.	Babu lokacin cire shi.
I'm not interested in your illness.	Ba ni da sha'awar ku rashin lafiya.
But it was night.	Amma dare yayi.
He can remember fear.	Ya iya tuna tsoro.
Or so everyone hears.	Ko don haka kowa ya ji.
I will stay here with him.	Zan tsaya a nan tare da shi.
So he was stopped.	Don haka aka tsaya masa.
Mostly without any problems.	Mafi yawa ba tare da matsala ba.
I don’t feel it here or even nearby.	Ba na jin shi a nan ko ma kusa.
Look up.	Ka duba sama.
But they can and should.	Amma suna iya kuma ya kamata.
So it can be done.	Don haka ana iya yi.
He could not know.	Ya kasa sani.
that life is happy.	cewa rayuwa ta kasance farin ciki.
Of course we all ran outside.	Tabbas duk mun gudu waje.
He does not smoke.	Baya shan taba.
Sleep, boy.	Yi barci, yaro.
Tell me why you like it.	Faɗa mini dalilin da yasa kuke so.
And only he knows.	Kuma shi kadai ya sani.
For there is another.	Don akwai wani.
I can't walk by myself.	Ba zan iya tafiya da kaina ba.
Anything you can touch, or hear, is problematic.	Duk wani abu da za ku iya taɓa, ko ji, yana da matsala.
There is something strange happening.	Akwai wani abu mai ban mamaki da ke faruwa.
It has to be.	Dole ne ya kasance.
You almost got me too.	Kun kusa samun ni ma.
If we want to be honest, we have to accept that fact.	Idan muna son mu kasance masu gaskiya, dole ne mu yarda da hakan.
Say, once a week.	Ka ce, sau ɗaya a mako.
So off he went.	Don haka ya tafi.
But on my own it doesn’t work.	Amma a kaina ba ya aiki.
I have a bad fever.	Ina da mummunan zafi.
Can anyone tell me how to do it.	Shin kowa zai iya gaya mani yadda zan yi.
I worked there every day.	Na yi aiki a wurin kowace rana.
He did not even agree to take the job.	Bai ma yarda ya dauki aikin ba.
I'm afraid she can't.	Ina tsoron kada ta iya.
I know exactly what to expect.	Na san ainihin abin da zan jira.
We must accept.	Dole ne mu yarda.
Only then did she hear others talking about it.	Sai kawai ta ji wasu suna magana game da shi.
Only one place.	Wuri ɗaya kawai.
We need to see them work together.	Muna bukatar mu ga suna aiki tare.
Get up once.	Tashi sau ɗaya.
When it does not hurt.	Lokacin da bai yi zafi ba.
Many people do not pay on time, some do not pay.	Mutane da yawa ba su biya akan lokaci, wasu ba su biya ba.
Learn and move on.	Koyi kuma ku ci gaba.
I have nothing useful to say.	Ba ni da wani abu mai amfani da zan ce.
Not really I did of course.	Ba da gaske na yi ba shakka.
He kept coming.	Ya ci gaba da zuwa.
This is a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne.
Now you have to eat.	Yanzu dole ne ku ci.
I found this to come twice.	Na sami wannan ya zo sau biyu.
He is not a man.	Shi ba mutum ba ne.
As always we are here.	Kamar kullum a nan muke.
A few years ago.	Shekaru kadan da suka gabata.
We can't even speak well.	Ba ma iya magana da kyau ba.
Love, love, love her.	So, so, son ta.
She and last night's events.	Ita da abubuwan da suka faru a daren jiya.
I like the way it looks.	Ina son yadda yake kama.
Does everyone know for sure.	Shin kowa ya san tabbas.
That he cared about her.	Cewa ya damu da ita.
Nothing further surprised them.	Babu wani abu da ya ƙara ba su mamaki.
I have to fly this beauty by next weekend.	Dole in tashi wannan kyawun zuwa karshen mako mai zuwa.
The more you can do, the better.	Da yawa za ku iya yi, mafi kyau.
In others, not.	A wasu, ba.
Now only three people are sitting.	Yanzu mutane uku ne kawai a zaune.
I don't really understand.	Ban gane da gaske ba.
There he stayed.	Nan ya zauna.
One hand made you all.	Hannu daya yasa ku duka.
He is not dead.	Bai mutu ba.
Now don't get lost.	Yanzu kar a bata.
Time will tell.	Lokaci zai yi tafiya.
There is no place to think.	Babu wurin tunani.
Very well printed.	An buga sosai.
And it's just beautiful.	Kuma yana da kyau kawai.
It will not be.	Ba zai kasance ba.
In this.	A cikin wannan.
Maybe they should stop using it.	Wataƙila sun fi kyau a daina amfani da shi.
It looks like we have a problem.	Gani na kamar muna da matsala.
That is not fair.	Hakan bai dace ba.
The opening ceremony was a real treat.	Bikin bude taron ya kasance na gaske.
Some things.	Wasu abubuwa.
I thought maybe you could do something with it.	Na yi tunanin watakila za ku iya yin wani abu da shi.
Something is wrong with it.	Wani abu ba daidai ba ne a ciki.
Remember you are only there one day.	Ka tuna cewa kana can kwana ɗaya kawai.
We were left alone in grief.	An bar mu kadai a cikin bakin ciki.
The police car is nearby.	Motar 'yan sanda na nan kusa.
I can talk to anyone.	Zan iya magana da kowa.
I do not agree with them.	Ban yarda da su ba.
I'll tell you what.	Zan gaya muku ko menene.
Everyone wants that.	Kowa ya so haka.
I tried everything there.	Na gwada komai a can.
Coffee has become a healthy drink.	Kofi ya zama abin sha na lafiya.
I can't wait to find something to eat.	Ba zan jira ko da in sami abin da zan ci ba.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
The plan is to be interesting.	Shirin shine ya zama mai ban sha'awa.
It's hard to stop there, and don't go.	Yana da wuya a tsaya a can, kuma kada ku tafi.
What do you say it is called.	Me kuka ce an kira shi.
If she could, she would cut it off.	Idan za ta iya, da ta yanke shi.
Aika wants to say something else.	Aika yana so ya ce wani abu kuma.
How nice to call.	Yaya kyau ku kira.
They cannot be recovered.	Ba za a iya dawo da su ba.
I will do the work.	Zan yi aikin.
Probably nothing more than that.	Wataƙila babu wani abu da ya wuce haka.
But it is not a job.	Amma ba aiki ba ne.
He called her.	Ya kira ta.
Do not keep dogs in the house.	Kada ta ajiye kare a gidan.
Let's take a look.	Mu duba.
They need help.	Suna buƙatar taimako.
It's too much.	Yana da yawa sosai.
You never know what each month will bring.	Ba ku taɓa sanin abin da kowane wata zai kawo ba.
I'm glad I did too.	Na yi farin ciki da hakan ma.
And of course, that time will be now.	Kuma tabbas, wannan lokacin zai kasance yanzu.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Ya kamata ku cire wannan tunanin daidai daga kan ku.
These are amazing people.	Waɗannan mutane ne masu ban mamaki.
You should be home.	Ya kamata ku kasance gida.
This is not true.	Wannan gaskiya ba haka bane.
I am a useful person, and not you.	Ni mutum ne mai amfani, kuma ba kai ba ne.
She did it all over the world.	Ta yi duk duniya haka.
Something went wrong here.	Wani abu bai yi daidai ba a nan.
It worked like this.	An yi aiki kamar haka.
It is always cold outside.	A ko da yaushe sanyi ya kan sa ni cikin gida.
I give him a run with it.	Ina ba shi gudu da shi.
I am not alone.	Ba ni da kai kaɗai ba.
I don't use it for anything.	Ba na amfani da shi don komai.
It's my turn.	Lokaci na ne.
She will take him.	Za ta kai shi.
So let's be smart.	Don haka mu zama masu hankali.
You know better than that.	Kun fi wannan sani.
Things were amazing.	Abubuwa sun kasance masu ban mamaki.
I have money	Ina da kudi
This is trying.	Wannan yana ƙoƙari.
And many other things.	Da sauran abubuwa.
This time.	Wannan lokacin.
But they did nothing.	Amma ba su yi komai ba.
She has been feeling this way for a long time.	Haka ta dade tana jin haka.
Everyone is laughing.	Kowa sai dariya yake yi.
She alone did not get there.	Ita kadai bata isa wurin ba.
It is up to the second to decide what to do.	Yana da na biyu don yanke shawarar abin da zai yi.
I see the problem.	Ina ganin matsalar.
I do not know how to proceed.	Ban san yadda zan ci gaba ba.
We are not sure we know exactly how to speak early.	Ba mu da tabbas mun san ainihin yadda muke magana da wuri.
Do not say.	Kar a ce.
I think it's too late.	Ina ganin tabbas ya makara.
But somehow we did.	Amma ko ta yaya muka yi.
Not good, maybe.	Babu kyau, watakila.
Time to think.	Lokacin tunani ya wuce.
I do not need to continue.	Ba na bukatar ci gaba.
I have to stop.	Dole ne in tsaya.
A comfortable home.	Gida mai dadi gida.
No one would expect them to succeed.	Ba wanda zai yi tsammanin za su yi nasara.
So it should not be said where we are going to do this.	Don haka bai kamata a ce a ina za mu yi wannan ba.
I will not ask for payment, as usual.	Ba zan nemi a biya ba, kamar yadda aka saba.
He said she preferred that.	Yace ta fi son haka.
She could not do anything.	Bata iya komai ba.
Maybe even see you here.	Wataƙila ma ganin ku a nan.
You can't just fly.	Ba za ku iya tashi kawai ba.
The hope is that almost everything comes right.	Fata shi ne cewa kusan komai ya zo daidai.
Do you want to participate with the kids?	Kuna so ku shiga tare da yara?
It is useful.	Yana da amfani.
We got everything we needed.	Mun sami duk abin da muke bukata.
I am a smart person.	Ni mutum ne mai hankali.
He acted like he was afraid to touch her.	Ya yi kamar mai tsoron taba ta.
You will never miss a cut.	Ba za ku taɓa rasa yanke ba.
Therefore, we want to know what must be done now.	Saboda haka, muna so mu san abin da dole ne a yi yanzu.
She should be allowed to die now.	Gara a bar ta ta mutu yanzu.
It is difficult to accept that he is not with us.	Yana da wuya a yarda cewa ba ya tare da mu.
It makes sense.	Yana da hankali.
The first is just something to do.	Na farko wani abu ne kawai da za a yi.
If anyone recognizes him he dies and dies.	Idan wani ya gane shi sai ya mutu ya mutu.
What in the world made you what you became?	Me a duniya ya sanya ku abin da kuka zama?
But it is difficult.	Amma yana da wuya.
We will not go back.	Ba za mu koma ba.
But that still can’t be right.	Amma wannan har yanzu ba zai iya zama daidai ba.
They are not included in the future.	Ba a saka su a nan gaba.
Give her this.	Kai mata wannan.
He made good progress.	Ya yi kyakkyawan ci gaba.
He was also great.	Ya kuma kasance mai girma.
A high-speed car can travel at high speeds.	Mota mai sauri tana iya tafiya cikin sauri mai girma.
She never got a job.	Ba ta taba samun aiki ba.
We found it nice to have this event.	Mun ga yana da kyau a yi wannan taron.
And it started well.	Kuma ya fara da kyau.
They saw what they saw.	Sun ga abin da suka gani.
I love scary people.	Ina son mutane masu ban tsoro.
Everyone sat down.	Kowa ya zauna.
Everything is great.	Duk abin da yake mai girma.
This will never happen.	Wannan ba zai taba faruwa ba.
It feels so right.	Yana jin daidai sosai.
And so it was.	Kuma haka ya kasance.
It will not be settled.	Ba za a zauna ba.
So it’s amazing.	Don haka abin ban mamaki ne.
There is more to us than to them.	Akwai fiye da mu fiye da su.
Or maybe not.	Ko watakila ba haka ba ne.
You will kill us all.	Za ku kashe mu duka.
It was very happy.	An yi farin ciki sosai.
She should finish the housework.	Kamata yayi ta gama aikin gida.
That's what you did.	Abin da kuka yi ke nan.
It is our pleasure.	Abin farin cikin mu ne.
Kids are not good for me.	Yara ba su da kyau a gare ni.
The past is still close to us.	Abubuwan da suka gabata har yanzu suna kusa da mu.
There are three women.	Akwai mata uku.
Someone is looking down.	Wani yana kallon kasa.
No, not really, but it feels like it.	A'a, ba da gaske ba, amma yana jin kamar shi.
He told you that and that is what he is doing.	Ya gaya maka haka kuma abin da yake yi kenan.
You do not think.	Ba kuna tunani ba.
Everything is known to you.	Duk abin da aka sani a gare ku.
He said.	Ya fad'a.
Not like you, not really.	Ba son ku, ba da gaske ba.
I didn’t get that in the end.	Ban sami haka ba a ƙarshe.
You do not hear it coming.	Ba ka ji yana zuwa.
Do not hit people.	Kar a buga mutane.
I think you do too.	Ina tsammanin kun yi ma.
Tell him everything is going right here.	Ka gaya masa komai yana tafiya daidai a nan.
The others waited outside.	Sauran sun jira waje.
They ate from it.	Sun ci daga ciki.
I can never fail.	Ba zan iya taba kasa ba.
At first no one was there.	Da farko babu kowa a wurin.
We are worried.	Mun damu.
I am not a police officer.	Ni ba dan sanda ba ne.
Now they have.	Yanzu suna da.
Talk a little.	Yi magana kadan.
This guy is smart.	Wannan mutumin yana da hankali.
He knows they are not many.	Ya san ba su da yawa.
I, of course, am better than all this.	Ni, ba shakka, na fi wannan duka.
It is time to do things.	Lokaci yayi da za a yi abubuwa.
You know what I really feel.	Kun san abin da nake ji sosai.
Or she kind of did.	Ko ita irin ta yi.
I had to get out of there, quickly.	Dole ne in fita daga wurin, da sauri.
First, nothing is as simple as it seems.	Na farko, babu wani abu mai sauƙi kamar yadda ake gani.
He will get another.	Zai sami wani.
No, don't apologize.	A'a, kar a ba da hakuri.
But we can live without these.	Amma za mu iya rayuwa ba tare da waɗannan ba.
I don’t know if what you read is true or not.	Ban sani ba ko abin da ka karanta gaskiya ne ko a'a.
So we started school.	Haka muka fara makaranta.
I feel like he is saying something.	Ina jin yana cewa wani abu.
Too much too much.	Da yawa da yawa.
Not necessarily, how.	Ba lallai ba ne, ta yaya.
It happened to her, and it happened a lot.	Ya faru da ita, kuma ya faru da yawa.
This is not something she can refuse.	Wannan ba wani abu ba ne da za ta iya ƙi.
But we know what happened in the past.	Amma mun san abin da ya faru a baya.
I did not stop.	Ban daina ba.
No, it can't be.	A'a, ba zai iya zama ba.
Now, let's see what it contains.	Yanzu, bari mu ga abin da ke ciki.
This is of course a lie.	Wannan ba shakka karya ne.
It started very quickly.	Ya fara da sauri sosai.
Sorry for the delay.	Yi hakuri na makara.
I used all my beauty.	Na yi amfani da duk kyau na.
Whoever got it, had something great.	Wanda ya samu, da wani abu mai girma.
And it needs heat.	Kuma yana buƙatar zafi.
She was about to leave when he entered.	Tana shirin fita, sai ya shiga.
Maybe that's what she will do.	Wataƙila abin da za ta yi ke nan.
You have your meeting.	Kuna da taron ku.
It's good for me.	Yana da kyau a gare ni.
It was a scary day.	Rana ce mai ban tsoro.
The police are looking for him.	‘Yan sanda na neman sa.
And that is not fair.	Kuma hakan bai dace ba.
It gets colder.	Yana ƙara yin sanyi.
Otherwise, if they wanted us to know, they would have told us.	Ban da haka, da sun so mu sani, da sun gaya mana.
What do they think they are doing?	Me suke ganin suke yi?
Don't forget that.	Kar a manta da haka.
She is very optimistic.	Tana da fata sosai.
What do they want us to do?	Me suke so mu yi?
There is just so much of this movie to hate.	Akwai kawai da yawa na wannan fim ɗin don ƙi.
Show and win, whatever.	Nuna kuma nasara, komai.
He raised his hand, but before he could speak.	Hannu ya daga, amma kafin yayi magana.
Still not comfortable, but trying to work from the inside out.	Har yanzu ba dadi, amma ƙoƙarin yin aiki daga ciki.
This can happen to anyone including you.	Wannan na iya faruwa ga kowa ciki har da ku.
She got it.	Ta samu.
I want to hear that again.	Ina so in sake jin haka.
You can not live on your own.	Ba za ku iya zama da kanku ba.
I love you so much.	Ina son ku sosai.
Speak!	Yi magana!
We flew again alone.	Muka sake tashi mu kadai.
It is really something that you have to work on every day.	Yana da gaske wani abu da dole ne ku yi aiki a kowace rana.
I don't want to drink it anymore.	Ba na son in sha shi kuma.
He did it alone.	Shi kadai ya yi.
I tried my best to win it.	Na yi ƙoƙari sosai don yin nasara da shi.
Or he will come back.	Ko kuma zai dawo.
All the while, it still makes me happy.	Kowane lokaci, har yanzu yana sa ni farin ciki.
She would not have come.	Da ma bata zo ba.
Try it, you will be amazed.	Gwada shi, za ku yi mamaki.
She has been dead ever since.	Ta mutu tun daga lokacin.
But where he is today, he is a very good athlete.	Amma inda yake a yau, dan wasa ne mai kyau sosai.
So let's be serious. 	Don haka mu yi da gaske.

I do not know what we heard at the time.	Ban san abin da muka ji a lokacin ba.
He drank coffee every night.	Ya sha kofi kowane dare.
Maybe I miss something here.	Wataƙila ina rasa wani abu a nan.
He came to see how it was done.	Ya zo ya ga yadda ya dace.
I decided to save it for future reference.	Na yanke shawarar ajiye shi don tunani na gaba.
It is the best place to stay.	Shi ne mafi kyawun wurin zama.
This is a really good place.	Wannan wuri ne mai kyau gaske.
And it is true.	Kuma gaskiya ce.
This is something we need to pay attention to.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya kamata mu dan ba da hankali a kai.
Not women.	Ba mata ba.
However, not all of them died.	Duk da haka, ba duka ya mutu ba.
Now he knows.	Yanzu ya sani.
As usual, he fell asleep.	Kamar yadda ya saba, ya yi barci.
After a while, it became cold.	Bayan lokaci, ya zama sanyi.
If you do not need them in the future.	Idan ba ku buƙatar su nan gaba.
The water is hot.	Ruwan yayi zafi.
I'm trying to re-read.	Ina ƙoƙarin sake ɗaukar karatu.
That was only a short time.	Hakan ya kasance ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
She begins to cry.	Ta fara kuka.
I know you have not heard, but it is true.	Na san ba ku ji ba, amma gaskiya ne.
Take it here.	Kai shi nan.
I could not recognize him.	Ba zan iya gane shi ba.
Marriage is difficult.	Aure yana da wahala.
And tell her you will sell everything.	Kuma ka ce mata za ku sayar da komai.
Three times over.	Sau uku a kai.
As he has done many times before.	Kamar yadda ya yi sau da yawa a baya.
We could not do that.	Ba mu iya yin hakan ba.
He did more than was asked.	Ya yi fiye da yadda aka tambaye shi.
After she did that, she could no longer add.	Bayan ta yi haka, ba za ta iya ƙara ba.
Fix them once and for all.	Gyara su sau ɗaya kuma gaba ɗaya.
It's been a great year.	Yayi babban shekara.
They understand why they are fighting.	Sun fahimci dalilin da yasa suke fada.
Everyone knows it.	Kowa ya san shi.
They walk a lot there.	Suna tafiya da yawa a wurin.
He will not take anything.	Ba zai dauki komai ba.
He read them carefully.	Ya karanta su a hankali.
After a while, she found the one she recognized easily.	Bayan ɗan lokaci, ta sami wanda ta gane cikin sauƙi.
Some things happen.	Wasu abubuwa suna faruwa.
He is my favorite.	Shi ne wanda na fi so.
I don't remember when.	Ban tuna yaushe ba.
Or so it should be.	Ko haka ya kamata.
I have never been involved in such.	Ban taba shiga irin wannan ba.
There is nothing we can do.	Babu abin da za mu iya yi.
And, in fact, he still hasn’t.	Kuma, a gaskiya, har yanzu bai yi ba.
They immediately sold it.	Nan take suka sayar.
They passed.	Sun wuce.
I am a human being.	Ni mutum ne.
I can't go to them.	Ba zan iya zuwa gare su ba.
So we started doing the right thing.	Don haka muka fara yin daidai.
They can change it and cover it as they wish.	Za su iya canza shi kuma su rufe shi yadda suke so.
Lots of it.	Da yawa daga ciki.
Fear gripped him.	Tsoro ya kama shi.
Everyone laughed so hard.	Kowa yayi dariya sosai.
It surprised me.	Ya ba ni mamaki.
If we had gone together we would have thought later.	Da mun tafi tare mu yi tunani daga baya.
You never know.	Ba ka taba sani ba.
This time of year again.	Wannan lokacin na shekara kuma.
Someone is going somewhere, doing something.	Wani yana zuwa wani wuri, yana yin wani abu.
We have never seen that.	Ba mu taba ganin haka ba.
The first is the effort.	Na farko shine ƙoƙari.
Today everyone does that.	Yau kowa yayi haka.
She will not answer.	Ba zata amsa ba.
It has a lot to say to her.	Yana da yawa da zai ce mata.
I know this will not happen now but the thought is there.	Na san wannan ba zai faru ba a yanzu amma tunanin yana can.
Until she.	Har sai da ita.
But the interest did not stop.	Amma sha'awar bai daina ba.
But there is not much left of his own.	Amma babu sauran da yawa na kansa.
Lots of things like that.	Abubuwa da yawa kamar haka.
You can not live here without him.	Ba za ku iya zama a nan ba tare da shi ba.
So you kids keep giving it away.	Don haka ku yara ku ci gaba da ba da shi.
She made no mistake.	Ba ta yi kuskure ba.
He was weak and optimistic, but surprisingly healthy.	Ya kasance mai rauni kuma mai fata, amma abin mamaki lafiya.
Let me know what you got though.	Bari in san abin da kuka samu ko.
I got an answer	Na sami amsa
We would have done better.	Da mun yi kyau sosai.
We went to work.	Mun tafi aiki.
You have to talk to them.	Dole ne ku yi magana da su.
Many died here.	Mutane da yawa sun mutu a nan.
He can talk to anyone.	Zai iya magana da kowa.
I get this error.	Ina samun wannan kuskure.
The water is very cold.	Ruwan yayi sanyi sosai.
Removing these should fix your problem.	Cire waɗannan yakamata ya gyara matsalar ku.
We were the last ones to go.	Mu ne na ƙarshe da muka tafi.
Nothing else seems to be enough.	Babu wani abu kuma da alama ya isa.
They are the best.	Su ne mafi kyau.
I want to do a great job that way.	Ina son yin babban aiki haka.
She immediately asked for food.	Nan take ta nemi abinci.
Are you interested in it?	Shin kana sha'awar shi?
Yet she could know.	Amma duk da haka ta iya sani.
Remove everything.	Cire komai.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu ya faru ba daidai ba.
They protect us and we protect them.	Suna kare mu kuma muna kare su.
You are good at it.	Kuna da kyau da shi.
She may never succeed.	Wataƙila ba za ta taɓa samun nasara ba.
Not because of me.	Ba saboda ni ba.
It is difficult to forget what happened.	Yana da wuya a manta abin da ya faru.
I can talk to him very much now.	Zan iya magana da shi sosai yanzu.
I am not telling you to read.	Ba ina gaya muku ku karanta ba.
That doesn't work though.	Wannan baya aiki ko da yake.
They stood in the back of the room.	Suka tsaya a bayan dakin.
Check out our favorites below !.	Duba abubuwan da muka fi so a kasa!.
I love this country.	Ina son wannan kasa.
Really hear and see.	Da gaske ji kuma gani.
All your players are gone.	Duk 'yan wasan ku sun tafi.
He did not know that the future would be so.	Bai san nan gaba za ta kasance haka ba.
He must have been thinking.	Ba shakka ya kasance yana tunani.
If the function does not work properly.	Idan aikin ba ya aiki sosai.
He is gone.	Shi ne ya tafi.
I am going to him.	Ina zuwa gare shi.
Focus on this project, nothing.	Mai da hankali kan wannan aikin, ba komai.
Before we move on, let’s just take a look at our tools.	Kafin mu ci gaba, bari kawai mu duba kayan aikin mu.
The future is not over yet, and the past is gone.	Gaba ba ta nan tukuna, kuma abin da ya gabata ya tafi.
He wants to know who to call.	Yana son sanin wanda kowa zai kira.
Not one of the above.	Ba ɗaya daga cikin abubuwan da ke sama ba.
He is doing it now.	Yana yin haka yanzu.
I'm fine with that.	Na yi lafiya da hakan.
We finished talking.	Mun gama magana.
This has been the case since we were children.	Haka ta kasance tun muna yara.
But that would not be right.	Amma hakan ba zai yi daidai ba.
So think about what you want.	Don haka tunanin abin da kuke so.
We can be killed.	Ana iya kashe mu.
There is a chance he could succeed.	Akwai damar da zai iya yin nasara.
And sometimes that is true.	Kuma wani lokacin hakan gaskiya ne.
I know how it feels when they love you.	Na san yadda yake ji idan suna son ku.
When do we start?	Yaushe za mu fara?
He is real and he is a person, too, like all of us.	Yana da gaske kuma shi mutum ne, kuma, kamar mu duka.
We know what to expect of him.	Mun san abin da za mu jira daga gare shi.
However, we.	Duk da haka, mu.
Even if we can find someone who will.	Ko da za mu iya samun wanda zai.
I knew right away.	Na sani nan da nan.
It was his own, they said.	Ya kasance da kansa, suka ce.
I got it done.	Na samu yi.
You get up after two months.	Kuna tashi bayan wata biyu.
Check the temperature.	Duba zafi.
What he has is very interesting.	Abin da yake da shi yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
But it is still there.	Amma har yanzu yana nan.
They were killed.	An kashe su.
It really comes together really well.	Da gaske ya zo tare sosai.
Any kind of work.	Kowane irin aiki.
To play in the events.	Don yin wasa a abubuwan da ya faru.
I missed the end.	Na rasa karshen.
I started here!	Na fara nan!
He must have been able to surprise himself.	Dole ne ya iya mamakin kansa.
Exactly the same school.	Daidai da makaranta.
He says to himself.	Kansa yake fada.
Nothing has ever been made to go well.	Ba a taɓa yin wani abu ya tafi da kyau ba.
I did nothing!	Ban yi komai ba!
He learned nothing.	Bai koyi komai ba.
To each other.	Da juna.
There is no other way.	Babu wata hanya kawai.
No matter how much they love them.	Duk yadda suke son su.
Maybe he didn't hear me.	Watakila bai ji ni ba.
We are safe now.	Muna lafiya yanzu.
It should be cold.	Kamata yayi sanyi.
You are a great person.	Kai babban mutum ne.
He just wanted to get people around.	Ya kawai son samun mutane a kusa.
She makes them eat and drink.	Ta sa su ci su sha.
This will explain it.	Wannan zai bayyana shi.
Kind of like a game.	Irin kamar wasa.
This upset her a little, but she got used to it.	Hakan ya dan bata mata rai, amma ta saba.
Take a plane.	Dauki jirgin sama.
Take off your shirt and get up here.	Cire rigar ka tashi nan.
I am intelligent.	Ni mai hankali ne.
I do not know why but it is not.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa ba amma ba haka ba ne.
These appeared during the night.	Waɗannan sun bayyana a cikin dare.
The car is well maintained.	An kula da motar sosai.
we can not go.	ba za mu iya tafiya ba.
Who knows what.	Wa ya san me.
Give him your best.	Ka ba shi mafi kyawun ku.
Maybe that sounds good right now.	Wataƙila hakan yayi kyau a yanzu.
Cannot check response.	Ba za a iya duba amsa ba.
It does not go that way.	Ba ya tafiya haka.
That would be ridiculous.	Wannan zai zama abin ban dariya.
But then it rained.	Amma sai aka yi ruwa.
I did not tell anyone.	Ban gaya wa kowa ba.
We need to change that.	Muna bukatar mu canza hakan.
If it weren't for him, she wouldn't get it.	In ba don shi ba, ba za ta samu ba.
I didn’t tell you that you would never see the movie.	Ban gaya muku cewa ba za ku taɓa ganin fim ɗin ba.
He should not be so upset with her.	Bai kamata ya bata mata rai sosai ba.
Everyone else takes it easy.	Duk sauran suna ɗaukar shi cikin sauƙi.
He will take care of you.	Zai kula da ku.
We could not read it otherwise.	Ba za mu iya karanta shi ba idan ba haka ba.
I feel like there is no bigger job.	Ina jin kamar babu wani aiki da ya fi girma.
I was wrong.	Na yi kuskure.
We must use water carefully.	Dole ne mu yi amfani da ruwa a hankali.
I had to run to keep it going.	Dole na gudu don ci gaba da ita.
He looked for a job but could not find one.	Ya nemi aiki amma bai samu ba.
In fact, nothing happened.	A gaskiya, babu abin da ya faru.
Please marry me.	Don Allah a aure ni.
But not one.	Amma ba daya ba.
A woman stopped.	Wata mata ta tsaya.
But if you do, you are in good hands.	Amma idan kun yi haka, kuna cikin hannu mai kyau.
They do not speak.	Ba su magana.
He was just.	Ya kasance kawai.
There is so much to see!	Akwai abubuwa da yawa don gani!
More unknown.	Ƙarin da ba a sani ba.
He was with me all the time.	Duk tsawon lokacin yana tare da ni.
She is not a woman today.	Ba ta mata a yau ba.
But it is too late.	Amma ya makara sosai.
So that made me great.	Don haka wannan ya yi mini girma.
At first we were very careful.	Da farko muna da hankali a hankali.
She finished.	Ta gama.
Something they would never do.	Wani abu da ba za su taɓa yi ba.
They will be hurt but it will pass.	Za su ji rauni amma zai wuce.
But he could not do anything.	Amma bai iya yin komai ba.
Let it stand.	Bari ya tsaya.
I know how it is.	Na san yadda abin yake.
That you are happy and that you are good.	Cewa kun yi farin ciki kuma kuna da kyau.
But it made me feel a little better.	Amma ya dan yi mani dadi.
But don’t think anyone here has you.	Amma kada ku yi tunanin kowa a nan yana da ku.
You can check that out right away.	Kuna iya duba hakan nan da nan.
Everything is dead.	Komai ya mutu.
Something that bothered me.	Wani abu da ya ji daɗi da ni.
The flight was delayed.	Da jirgin ya bata lokaci.
She should be very careful.	Kamata yayi ta kula sosai.
I really enjoy that feeling.	Lallai ina jin daɗin wannan ji.
Too much, too early.	Da ya yi yawa, da wuri.
It looks great.	Yayi kama sosai.
This is a wonderful day, isn't it?	Wannan rana ce mai daɗi, ko ba haka ba?
What works for you, works for you.	Abin da ke aiki a gare ku, yana aiki a gare ku.
She started to open the back door of the car.	Ta fara bude kofar bayan motar.
Sleep whenever you can.	Barci duk lokacin da za ku iya.
People will not have a problem with it.	Mutane ba za su sami matsala da shi ba.
I wonder what they do out of it.	Ina mamakin abin da suke yi daga ciki.
This is the first surprise.	Wannan shi ne abin mamaki na farko.
No problem.	Ba matsala.
You will never miss this.	Ba za ku taɓa rasa wannan ba.
But one came out.	Amma daya ya fita.
Probably not at the same time.	Wataƙila babu wani lokaci guda.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
I feel this way.	Ina jin wannan.
Many years have passed, and they are gone.	Shekaru da yawa sun wuce, kuma sun tafi.
But it is not the same as eating each other.	Amma ba daidai yake da cin juna ba.
He saw it too.	Ya ga haka ma.
He will die in a year.	Zai mutu nan da shekara guda.
We need to know what to do.	Ya kamata mu san abin da za mu yi.
I will not do it again.	Ba zan kara yi ba.
I like money	Ina son kudi
So we’re just going to keep doing more of that.	Don haka kawai za mu ci gaba da yin ƙarin hakan.
But it works for me.	Amma tana yi min aiki.
I do not like.	Ba na so.
Then it ended today.	Daga nan ya kare a yau.
But really, this is not a job.	Amma da gaske, wannan ba aiki ba ne.
Someone took them.	Wani ya tafi da su.
Despite.	Shi ne.
It seems like something out of the ordinary.	Da alama wani irin abu ne.
Just go there.	Kawai ku je can.
This person is familiar with the past.	Wannan mutumin ya saba da abubuwan da suka gabata.
I need to save it.	Ina bukata in ajiye shi.
I think he is back.	Ina tsammanin ya dawo.
I agree it is good this way though.	Na yarda yana da kyau ta wannan hanyar ko da yake.
There are no police around.	Babu 'yan sanda a kusa.
Be productive.	Ka kasance mai yawan aiki.
He could not speak.	Ko magana ya kasa yi.
He is wearing a shirt.	Sanye yake da rigar riga.
I will not read it all now.	Ba zan karanta shi duka ba a yanzu.
Some do little.	Wasu suna yin kadan.
Let them enjoy the game they played.	Su yi farin ciki da wasan da suka buga.
Then the teacher spoke.	Sai malamin yayi magana.
He grabbed me by the arm.	Ya kama ni da hannu.
I look at the man.	Ina kallon mutumin.
I have always been interested in this.	A koyaushe ina sha'awar wannan.
They can be though.	Suna iya zama ko da yake.
He said nothing.	Bai ce komai ba.
I want to do.	Ina son yi.
I think it is.	Ina tsammanin yana da.
It is heavenly.	Na sama ne.
The help received led to the fight.	Taimakon da aka samu ya kai ga fada.
No one will do that.	Babu wanda zai yi haka nan.
It never looked like that again.	Bai sake zama kamar haka ba.
Even in cold and rainy weather.	Ko a cikin sanyi da ruwan sama.
I want to talk more.	Ina so in kara magana.
Not sure.	Bai tabbata ba.
We must recognize it.	Dole ne mu gane shi.
Will you join us ?.	Za ku shiga mu?.
I think that will change everything very much.	Ina tsammanin hakan zai canza komai sosai.
She never got anything scary from me.	Ba ta taba samun abin tsoro daga gare ni ba.
But they have reached us.	Amma sun isa gare mu.
Try to play.	Yi ƙoƙarin yin wasa.
They only live on the road.	Suna rayuwa ne kawai a kan hanya.
I do not recommend it.	Ba na ba da shawarar shi ba.
I run fast.	Ina gudu da sauri.
Or even have one.	Ko ko da yana da daya.
They eat three meals a day.	Suna cin abinci sau uku a rana.
I felt comfortable and scared at the same time.	Na ji dadi da tsoro a lokaci guda.
I don't like it at all.	Ban son shi ko kadan.
If you want to be.	Idan kana son zama.
We do not know for sure.	Ba mu sani ba tabbas.
I need to talk to you.	Ina bukata in yi magana da ku.
Give us this story.	Ba mu wannan labarin.
I don’t think anyone would think like me.	Ba na tsammanin kowa zai yi tunani kamar ni.
And he succeeded.	Kuma ya yi nasara.
It will come out.	Zai fito.
But he did not recognize him.	Amma bai gane shi ba.
She understood how she felt about him.	Ta gane yadda take ji a kansa.
She wanted a good idea.	Ta so kyakkyawan tunani.
There was a man in this meeting who should not have been there.	Akwai wani mutum a cikin wannan taron da bai kamata ya kasance a wurin ba.
I showed some.	Na nuna wasu.
It looks a little weird.	Ga alama ɗan ban mamaki.
Everything with you is new.	Duk abin da ke tare da ku sabon abu ne.
He also loves them.	Shi ma yana son su.
However, it is not necessarily so simple.	Duk da haka, ba lallai ba ne mai sauƙi haka.
I know where he is all the time.	Na san inda yake duk lokacin.
You know, as much as you want.	Ka sani, kamar yadda kuke so.
All the hard work came later.	Duk aikin wahala ya zo daga baya.
She begins to cry.	Ta fara kuka.
Not today, not next week, but down the road.	Ba yau ba, ba mako mai zuwa ba, amma a kasa hanya.
But she did not want to.	Amma ba ta so.
We must change this plan.	Dole ne mu canza wannan shirin.
I'm tired.	Dan gaji.
He does not trust anyone.	Baya yarda da kowa.
Forget the rest.	Manta da sauran.
I was the first person to hear the story.	Ni ne mutum na farko da ya fara jin labarin.
Much progress has been made.	An samu ci gaba sosai.
It is a beautiful place.	Wuri ne mai kyau.
She was the only one killed.	Ita kadai aka kashe.
And now, of course, this approach is wrong.	Kuma yanzu, ba shakka, wannan hanyar ba daidai ba ce.
I was with her.	Na kasance tare da ita.
But today we will just do that.	Amma yau za mu yi haka kawai.
Start your work.	Fara aikin ku.
The next project looks like a scary one.	Aikin da ke gaba ya zama kamar mai ban tsoro.
We laughed together.	Muka yi dariya tare.
But not many people will stand by it.	Amma ba mutane da yawa za su tsaya tare da shi ba.
No one came, except her.	Ba wanda ya zo, sai ita.
She said.	Ita ce ta fada.
Of course she should see it coming.	Tabbas yakamata ta ga yana zuwa.
The police came somehow.	'Yan sanda sun zo ko ta yaya.
And he knows that they will.	Kuma ya san cewa za su yi.
So the people returned to them.	Da haka mutane suka koma gare su.
I watched what happened.	Na kalli abin ya faru.
It does very well.	Yana yin kyau sosai.
We forgot, you see.	Mun manta, kun gani.
Completely.	Na gaba daya.
Let me print it.	Bari in buga shi.
She thought a little.	Ta yi tunani kadan.
They are always in great pain.	Kullum suna cikin wahala sosai.
There is no way, no way.	Babu hanya, babu ta yaya.
Yaro ne!	Yaro ne!
True, if you just want to see it.	Gaskiya ne, idan kuna son ganin ta kawai.
A new moon will appear tonight.	Wani sabon wata zai bayyana a daren yau.
I will speak	zan yi magana
I think it's a good thing.	Ina tsammanin abu ne mai kyau.
He stopped eating and drinking.	Ya daina ci da sha.
This article may be true.	Wannan labarin yana iya zama gaskiya.
So is good speech.	Haka ma magana mai kyau.
He refused to see anyone.	Bai yarda ya ga kowa ba.
This is where it gets really interesting.	Wannan shine inda yake samun ban sha'awa sosai.
She plays one by one.	Tana wasa daya da daya.
You see she doesn't know what she's talking about, like.	Ka ga ba ta san me take cewa ba, kamar.
He just gave you the tools.	Ya ba ku kayan aikin ne kawai.
We did it on time.	Mun yi shi a daidai lokacin.
Probably not to be missed.	Wataƙila ba za a rasa wanda ya tafi ba.
Win the next game.	Nasara wasa na gaba.
Just go.	Ku tafi kawai.
I will tell you the truth here.	Zan gaya muku gaskiya a nan.
She is worried.	Ta damu.
But with them you do not really know them.	Amma da su ba ka san su da gaske ba.
Less than you.	Kasa da ku.
I can not miss this opportunity.	Ba zan iya rasa wannan damar ba.
This person is beyond that.	Wannan mutumin ya wuce haka.
It's like waiting for something.	Kamar ana jira wani abu ne.
He has so many things to do.	Yana da abubuwa da yawa da zai yi.
I found my truth.	Na sami gaskiya ta.
It should be a wonderful celebration.	Ya kamata a yi bikin ban mamaki.
I am the next person.	Ni ne mutum na gaba.
We have children.	Muna da yara.
This is the first.	Wannan shi ne na farko.
And it feels good.	Kuma yana jin dadi.
This does not prove it.	Wannan bai tabbatar da haka ba.
And they loved it.	Kuma sun so shi.
This has had some success.	Wannan ya sami ɗan nasara.
We need to see ahead, and not be intimidated.	Muna bukatar mu gani a gaba, kuma kada mu ji tsoro.
Please get up.	Da fatan za a tashi.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
And they will leave me alone.	Kuma za su bar ni ni kadai.
This always happens when you are late.	Wannan koyaushe yana faruwa idan kun makara.
I was so tired I didn't care.	Na gaji da yawa ban damu ba.
I need to think.	Ina bukata in yi tunani.
I take care of them in every way.	Ina kula da su ta kowace hanya.
And it is amazing.	Kuma abin mamaki ne.
She was not alone.	Ita kadai ba ta yi ba.
This year, however, they decided to travel the world.	A bana, duk da haka, sun yanke shawarar tafiya duniya.
Just when it was good, it came to an end.	Daidai lokacin da ya yi kyau, ya zo ƙarshe.
I have to travel.	Dole ne in yi tafiya.
No sense in running.	Babu hankali gudu.
I have a cold.	Na yi sanyi.
But it is not over.	Amma bai kare ba.
That is not fair.	Hakan bai dace ba.
You have to put them in.	Dole ne ku saka su a ciki.
Still early yet.	Har yanzu da wuri tukuna.
They did not see.	Ba su gani ba.
You can not try to do things.	Ba za ku iya ƙoƙarin yin abubuwa ba.
No one spoke to her.	Babu wanda yayi mata magana.
Seriously, though, let’s eat.	Da gaske, ko da yake, bari mu ci.
Two good years.	Shekaru biyu masu kyau.
Not much ago, not even that.	Ba da yawa da suka wuce, ba ma haka ba.
They are not.	Ba su ba.
Actually I don’t feel very comfortable.	A gaskiya ba na jin dadi sosai.
I am the new person.	Ni ne sabon mutumin.
Tonight is not a night for a drink.	Daren yau ba dare ne ga wani abin sha ba.
The program is not over.	Shirin bai kare ba.
And it.	Kuma shi.
So the story went.	Don haka labarin ya tafi.
But it's fun !.	Amma abin farin ciki ne!.
I arrived early for the flight.	Na isa da wuri don jirgin.
I know him very well.	Na san shi sosai.
And she failed.	Kuma ta kasa ce.
I did what he said.	Na yi abin da ya ce.
So it would be like this.	Don haka zai kasance kamar haka.
It looks weak.	Ga alama rauni.
He quickly left the house.	Da sauri ya bar gidan.
This restaurant has the best fish.	Wannan gidan cin abinci yana da mafi kyawun kifi.
Or less so.	Ko kasa da haka.
I know what you are hearing now.	Na san abin da kuke ji a yanzu.
In fact, they have nothing at all.	A gaskiya, ba su da wani abu ko kaɗan.
She thought the problem.	Ta yi tsammanin matsala.
I don’t see why they would.	Ban ga dalilin da ya sa za su yi ba.
It is not an easy thing to live.	Ba abu mai sauƙi ba ne don rayuwa.
I feel so much bigger now.	Ina jin girma sosai yanzu.
It's not like anything.	Ba kamar wani abu bane.
It will not work.	Ba zai yi aiki ba.
Use caution.	Yi amfani da hankali.
But this was not done.	Amma ba a yi hakan ba.
So I'm glad to see you again.	Don haka ina jin daɗin sake ganin ku.
He will wait for the night.	Zai jira dare.
Time is good for meditation.	Lokaci yayi da kyau don tunani.
Many people were killed.	An kashe mutane da dama.
People began to walk slowly.	Mutane suka fara tafiya a hankali.
There is nothing else to this.	Babu wani abu kuma ga wannan.
It's cold.	Yana da sanyi.
We did it once.	Mun yi shi sau ɗaya.
And he is here with us.	Kuma yana nan tare da mu.
And there is a place.	Kuma akwai wani wuri.
No one has ever believed it before.	Babu wanda ya taba yarda da ita a baya.
He didn't even call.	Bai ma kira ba.
He doesn't want to hear the thought.	Baya son jin tunanin.
They do not need to think about it.	Ba sa bukatar yin tunani a kai.
Don't worry, 'he said.	Kar ka damu,' in ji shi.
This room is empty.	Wannan dakin babu kowa.
And now is the time.	Kuma yanzu ne lokacin.
She is not wearing anything.	Bata sanye da komai ba.
She was sure she was familiar.	Ta tabbata ta saba.
Now they know where we are.	Yanzu sun san inda muke.
I like things	Ina son abubuwa
We run at night.	Muna gudu da dare.
You do not want to have anything to do with it.	Ba ka so ka sami abin yi da shi.
Amazing things.	Abubuwa masu ban mamaki.
This surprise is fascinating.	Wannan abin mamaki yana da ban sha'awa.
I know they have two children.	Na san suna da yara biyu.
I give you a place to sleep.	Na ba ku wurin kwana.
No, there is no problem here.	A'a, babu matsala a nan.
No one has ever talked to anyone about the work being done.	Ba a taɓa yin magana da kowa game da aikin da ake yi ba.
But they did not find anyone.	Amma ba su sami kowa ba.
One that will do well.	Wanda zai yi kyau.
She took the train home.	Ta dauki jirgin zuwa gida.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu ne ya faru.
It just caught me off guard.	Sai kawai ya kama ni a hankali.
A big lunch was made at the house.	Babban abincin rana aka yi a gidan.
Go out into the world and do something worth writing about.	Fita a cikin duniya da yin wani abu da ya dace a rubuta game da shi.
Leave things as they are.	Bar abubuwa yadda suke.
This is not the case.	Wannan ba haka ba ne.
However, he returned to work.	Duk da haka, ya koma wurin aiki.
I won't even talk to you tomorrow.	Ba zan ma yi magana da ku gobe ba.
The work took a lot of time and effort.	Aikin ya ɗauki lokaci mai yawa da ƙoƙari.
One thing is for sure, though.	Abu daya ya tabbata, ko da yake.
He encountered it.	Ya ci karo da ita.
You have that opportunity, and we don't want that to happen.	Kuna da wannan damar, kuma ba ma son hakan ta faru.
I never went to it.	Ban taba zuwa gare ta ba.
I almost lost the game.	Kusan bata min wasan.
But we must.	Amma dole ne mu.
He did not have to go that way.	Ba sai ya tafi haka ba.
Maybe again.	Wataƙila kuma.
We are not who we used to be.	Mu ba wanda muka kasance ba.
There will be one last time, one last chance.	Za a yi lokaci na ƙarshe, dama ta ƙarshe.
Not now, not always, she said.	Ba yanzu ba, ba koyaushe ba, in ji ta.
It will be too late to work tonight.	Zai makara don aiki a daren yau.
It can't happen.	Ba zai iya faruwa ba.
It works well.	Yana aiki mai kyau.
I was scared of him and me.	Na ji tsoro gare shi da ni.
But she never really did.	Amma ba ta taɓa yin da gaske ba.
I hope it doesn't go away.	Ina fatan ba za ta tafi ba.
But that is over.	Amma an gama hakan.
In fact, it can be really easy.	A gaskiya ma, yana iya zama ainihin sauƙi.
I want us together.	Ina son mu tare.
She raises her hand.	Ta daga hannu sama.
I think it is better.	Ina tsammanin ya fi.
Let us know if you need anything.	Bari mu san idan kuna buƙatar wani abu.
He could not enter the place without me.	Ba zai iya shiga wurin ba tare da ni ba.
Each.	Kowa.
But she did not see it.	Amma bata gani ba.
I want to help.	Ina so in ba da taimako.
She will be back.	Zata dawo.
We just have to change what we hate.	Mu kawai mu canza abin da muke ƙi.
It's an interesting thing.	Abu ne mai ban sha'awa.
Today she left work early.	Yau ta bar aiki da wuri.
No wonder there, really.	Babu mamaki a can, da gaske.
I could not understand why no one was doing that.	Na kasa gane dalilin da yasa babu wanda yake yin hakan.
And he will go.	Kuma zai tafi.
I do not understand why.	Ban gane dalilin hakan ba.
This is what you do when you are up.	Abin da kuke yi ke nan lokacin da kuke sama.
Everyone knows that.	Kowa ya san haka.
If you are smart too.	Idan kana da hankali kai ma.
And she wanted to.	Kuma ta so.
Do not let it reach you.	Kada ku bari ya isa gare ku.
I played.	Na yi wasa.
I'm watching you.	Ina kallon ku.
Good night.	Ku kwana lafiya.
He laid himself down.	Ya ajiye kansa kasa.
I think of you too.	Ina tunanin ku ma.
Or it should be.	Ko kuma ya kamata.
So, we can also set the waiting time for use.	Don haka, muna iya kuma sanya lokacin jira don amfani.
To talk about what we want.	Don yin magana game da abin da muke so.
Some did.	Wasu ma sun yi.
It would be amazing.	Zai yi ban mamaki.
Don't touch this! 	Kar ku taɓa wannan!
I think here it will.	Ina tsammanin a nan zai yi.
she would say.	za ta ce.
That works a lot, much better.	Wannan yana aiki da yawa, mafi kyau.
They feel fine.	Sun ji lafiya.
It took once.	Ya dauka sau daya.
It will only hurt the amount of time we spend together.	Zai yi wahala kawai yawan lokacin da muke tare.
I do not know where they stand.	Ban san inda suka tsaya ba.
It was done by people.	An yi shi da mutane.
And maybe it's just an opportunity.	Kuma watakila dama ce kawai.
You know, it's amazing.	Ka sani, abin mamaki ne.
You have great help.	Kuna da babban taimako.
The game gives people the same attention.	Wasan ya ba wa mutane hankali guda ɗaya.
I'm waiting for him.	Ina jira shi.
Now move on.	Yanzu ci gaba.
No one is outside.	Babu kowa a waje.
Then he came to her.	Sai ya zo mata.
You do not know.	Ba ku sani ba.
Just, well, everything about the game.	Kawai, da kyau, komai game da wasan.
This place is perfect for her.	Wannan wurin ya dace da ita.
I don’t remember anything about that, though.	Ban tuna komai game da wannan ba, ko da yake.
But nothing is seen in this extract.	Amma babu abin da ake gani a wannan cire.
When the people started walking, it was night.	A lokacin da mutane suka fara tafiya, dare ya yi.
That's how he got the money.	A haka ya samu kudi.
One is mine.	Daya ne nawa.
It was given.	Aka ba shi.
It is not complete.	Ba ta cika ba.
He played a bad game.	Ya yi mummunan wasa.
Everything is happening to me.	Duk abin da ke faruwa a kaina ne.
Water demand for growth plans.	Bukatar ruwa na shirin girma.
I have no choice but to do so.	Bani da wata bukata da ta wuce haka.
He does not want to.	Ba ya so.
Never do this.	Kar a taba yin haka.
We will talk about these things later.	Za mu yi magana game da waɗannan abubuwa a gaba.
I think so today.	Ina ganin haka a yau.
I wouldn’t mind them.	Ba zan damu da su ba.
It's still good.	Har yanzu yana da kyau.
It must be stopped.	Dole ne a tsaya.
But this is not the case at all.	Amma ba haka ba ne gaba ɗaya.
We are sick.	Muna rashin lafiya.
Let him go, please.	Bar shi ya tafi, don Allah.
You told me.	Kun gaya mani.
He never got sick.	Bai taba yin rashin lafiya ba.
Bring the water to a boil.	Kawo ruwan a hankali.
The room is not just for everyone, but everything.	Dakin ba kowa bane kawai, amma komai.
I don’t know what could have happened.	Ban san abin da zai iya faruwa ba.
They provide food all day!	Suna ba da abinci duk rana!
But then she gave him another chance.	Amma sai ta sake ba shi dama.
About dog materials.	Game da kayan kare.
They make a lot of money.	Suna samun kuɗi da yawa.
This is work.	Wannan aiki ne.
She told him she was pregnant.	Ta fada masa tana da ciki.
Which for me is very uncertain.	Wanda a gare ni ba shi da tabbas sosai.
You can do whatever you want.	Kuna iya yin duk abin da kuke so.
We have to get off the plane.	Dole ne mu tashi daga jirgin.
But often you do not have time to do that.	Amma sau da yawa ba ku da lokacin yin wannan.
However you want to.	Duk da haka kuna so.
They are pretty healthy and he and I are.	Suna da kyau lafiya kuma ni da shi muna.
We keep playing until we finish the job.	Muna ci gaba da wasa har sai mun gama aikin.
The players are ready.	'Yan wasan sun shirya.
Rain is an exciting game.	Ruwan sama wasa ne mai ban sha'awa.
Of course, you can only make mistakes.	Tabbas, kuna iya samun kuskure kawai.
Check it out and tell us what you think !.	Duba shi kuma gaya mana abin da kuke tunani!.
Drink water.	A sha ruwa.
We looked at each other again, uncomfortable.	Muka sake kallon juna, babu dadi.
Think they can use the help.	Yi tsammanin za su iya amfani da taimakon.
I have a lot.	Ina da yawa.
But we are worried about it.	Amma mun damu da shi.
But now the time has not come.	Amma yanzu lokaci bai yi ba.
I feel it.	Ina jin shi.
This is true of every living thing.	Ana samun wannan gaskiya ne ga kowane abu mai rai.
And the second one would be fine.	Kuma na biyu zai yi kyau.
I think he left because he wanted to go.	Ina tsammanin ya tafi ne don yana so ya tafi.
He is my everything.	Shi ne komai na.
Tomorrow will not be very good.	Gobe ​​ba zai yi kyau sosai ba.
That she could be whoever she wanted.	Cewa za ta iya zama duk wanda take so.
I release you.	Na sake ku.
Sometimes it is.	Wani lokaci haka yake.
But she wrote to him.	Amma ta rubuta masa.
Do not do this thing.	Kada ku yi wannan abu.
Exit! 	Fita!
He enjoys it.	Yana jin daɗin hakan.
Do not rush.	Kar ku yi sauri.
He added another.	Ya kara wani.
Probably not.	Wataƙila bai yi ba.
You are not helping.	Ba ku taimako.
I will not tell you what it is called.	Ba zan gaya muku abin da ake kira shi ba.
She came back and closed it.	Ita kuma ta dawo ta rufe.
She can't do it fast.	Ba za ta iya yin shi da sauri ba.
Good thing !.	Abu mai kyau!.
Do not waste your money.	Kada ku bata kuɗin ku.
It was a great place to travel.	Ya kasance wuri mafi kyau don tafiya.
Otherwise, wait for us.	In ba haka ba, jira mu.
What it is and what it does.	Abin da yake da abin da yake yi.
I want to show you something.	Ina so in nuna muku wani abu.
I do not understand how that can be.	Ban gane yadda hakan zai iya zama ba.
Your work must be done and must be completed.	Dole ne a yi aikin ku kuma dole ne a gama shi.
Time to change course.	Lokaci don canza hanya.
Which happens right on a regular basis.	Wanda ya faru daidai a kai a kai.
They can see things like that.	Suna iya ganin abubuwa kamar haka.
One of us will.	Daya daga cikin mu zai.
They can do whatever they want.	Suna iya yin abin da suke so sosai.
Or they can.	Ko za su iya.
I want him back with us.	Ina so ya dawo tare da mu.
If you never talk about it, there is none.	Idan ba ku taɓa yin magana game da shi ba, babu shi.
I could never bring myself to do it.	Ba zan iya taɓa kawo kaina don yin shi ba.
If that works.	Idan hakan yana aiki.
On top of that, we are still waiting.	A kan haka, har yanzu muna jira.
Three times they died.	Sau uku sun mutu.
But she will not cry.	Amma ba za ta yi kuka ba.
The living space is very low.	Zaune yayi kasa sosai.
He is happy to have something to do.	Yana farin cikin samun abin yi.
I need to eat.	Ina bukata in ci abinci.
The same thing applies with other people.	Irin wannan abu na sauran mutane ne.
Maybe he was.	Wataƙila ya kasance.
That's the way life should be.	Haka ya kamata rayuwa ta kasance.
You want to be human.	Kuna so ku zama mutum.
Do this, do not do that.	Yi wannan, kada ku yi haka.
But do not be afraid.	Amma kada ku ji tsoro.
The truth is nothing.	Gaskiya ba komai.
I know this for sure.	Na san wannan a gaskiya.
He was immediately on earth.	Nan da nan ya kasance a duniya.
Send everything.	A aika da komai.
I did it and I took it to work and everyone loves it.	Na yi shi kuma na kai shi aiki kuma kowa yana son shi.
They make us fall.	Sun sa mu fada.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu wani abu da za a tabbatar kuma.
Just the way it is.	Kawai yadda abin yake.
He thought it would be a good job.	Ya yi tunanin zai zama aiki mai daɗi.
But now she is close.	Amma yanzu tana kusa.
But only if there is.	Amma kawai idan akwai.
I have never seen anything better.	Ban taba ganin wani abu mafi kyau ba.
He is not a man.	Ba mutum ba ne.
Our car is gone.	Motar mu ta tafi.
He found some, but he did not tell anyone.	Ya sami wasu, amma bai gaya wa kowa ba.
I want to win that day one day.	Ina so in ci nasara a wannan rana wata rana.
The door is open.	An bude kofar gidan.
It came to him that he should not do so.	Ya zo gare shi cewa bai kamata ya yi haka ba.
They did not trust me.	Ba su yarda da ni ba.
Normally, but what does this have to do.	Kullum, amma menene wannan dole ya yi.
It works.	Yana aiki.
We had a great time here.	Mun yi zama mai daɗi a nan.
That would give me interest, people.	Wannan zai ba ni ban sha'awa, mutane.
That would be really nice.	Wannan zai yi kyau da gaske.
There it is.	Akwai shi .
Of course it is.	Tabbas gaskiya ne.
The sun was hot and hot.	Ranar ta yi zafi kuma ta yi zafi.
They can add interest to a simple meal.	Za su iya ƙara sha'awa ga abinci mai sauƙi.
I do not break it once.	Bana karya shi sau daya.
The chances of it happening are many.	Damar ka yi ta ba ta da yawa.
Let him try.	Bari ya gwada.
We can help !.	Za mu iya taimaka!.
It’s about thinking.	Yana game da tunani.
I'm waiting.	Ina jira.
Intelligent people understand it.	Mutane masu hankali sun fahimci shi.
Whatever we want.	Duk abin da muke so.
All of this is well known for its need for reflection.	Duk wannan an san shi sosai don buƙatar tunani.
Sometimes they are used in music.	Wani lokaci ana amfani da su a cikin waƙa.
I think about it every day.	Ina tunanin ta kowace rana.
Everything past is here.	Duk abin da ya gabata yana nan.
You never know who will do it.	Ba ku taɓa sanin wanda zai yi me ba.
We went back to the car.	Muka koma mota.
Right and wrong.	Dama da kuskure.
She was close to me, and that was enough.	Ta kasance kusa da ni, kuma hakan ya isa.
First, she is very good at what she does.	Na ɗaya, ta yi kyau sosai a abin da take yi.
This is after the second.	Wannan shine bayan na biyu.
She went inside.	Ta shiga ciki.
It is good to see you.	Yana da kyau ganin ku.
It seems unnecessary.	Da alama bai zama dole ba.
But she knew who he was.	Amma ta san wanda ya yi.
They are not here.	Ba su nan.
She will continue to live together.	Za ta ci gaba da zama tare.
I will not pass this on to anyone.	Ba zan wuce wannan ga kowa ba.
I want to get up and go.	Ina so in tashi in tafi.
I do not come here often.	Ba na zuwa nan sau da yawa.
Look, do not say anything.	Duba, kada ku ce komai.
You had better accept it.	Gara ku yarda da shi.
So try to be close to the adults.	Don haka yi ƙoƙari ku kasance kusa da masu girma.
They are amazing.	Suna da ban mamaki.
The fight is over.	An gama fada.
No one does that.	Babu mai yin haka.
Who wrote this song?	Wanene ya rubuta wannan waƙa?
I have been here a long time.	Na dade da yawa a nan.
I just stood there.	Na tsaya kawai.
She too was killed.	Ita ma an kashe ta.
I drink a lot of coffee.	Ina shan kofi da yawa.
Immediately.	Nan take.
Everything she wants goes.	Duk abin da take so ya tafi.
Two children died.	Yara biyu sun mutu.
I'm not sure why.	Ban tabbata dalilin hakan ba.
It can be scary.	Yana iya zama mai ban tsoro.
But we can no longer.	Amma ba za mu iya ba kuma.
Then a month.	Sai wata daya.
Maybe a few.	Wataƙila 'yan kaɗan ne.
But this last statement is false.	Amma wannan magana ta ƙarshe karya ce.
He said it was good.	Ya ce yana da kyau.
Not necessarily good.	Ba lallai ba ne mai kyau.
And he went to him.	Kuma ya tafi zuwa gare shi.
A child should be able to see that.	Ya kamata yaro ya iya ganin haka.
She just knows.	Ta sani kawai.
But we know each other.	Amma mun san juna.
So that's why I use this.	Don haka shi ya sa nake amfani da wannan.
At some point, you have to stop.	A wani lokaci, dole ne ku daina.
She told him he could decide for himself.	Ta ce masa zai iya yanke shawarar kansa.
You tell us about you.	Kuna gaya mana game da ku.
He started talking, and stopped.	Ya fara magana, ya tsaya.
They live on the side of the road.	Suna zaune a bakin hanya.
The second time.	A karo na biyu.
You can see that it is going to rain.	Kuna iya ganin cewa za a yi ruwan sama.
That's it.	Ni ke nan.
It was very feminine.	Abin ya kasance mata sosai.
I could not sleep.	Na kasa yin barci.
Not eaten.	Ba a ci ba.
We need to clarify the truth more.	Mun fi bukatar bayyana gaskiya.
I love life.	Ina sha'awar rayuwa.
They were arrested there.	An kama su a can.
They love me and need me.	Suna so na kuma suna bukata.
If you are using one, try removing it.	Idan kana amfani da ɗaya, gwada cire shi.
The project does not have such a problem.	Aikin ba shi da irin wannan matsala.
You can break it easily.	Kuna iya karya shi cikin sauƙi.
I would highly recommend seeing it.	Zan ba da shawarar ganin ta sosai.
I missed the moment.	Na rasa lokacin.
That made him feel like a child again.	Hakan yasa ya sake jin kamar yaro.
Sorry it's cold.	Yi hakuri yana da sanyi.
Some are good, some are good.	Wasu na da kyau, wasu na da kyau.
I do not agree with that yet.	Ban yarda da hakan ba tukuna.
Work with this.	Yi aiki da wannan.
This is nothing.	Wannan ba komai ba ne.
This has happened many times.	Hakan ya faru sau da yawa.
This is the most likely thing to happen.	Wannan shi ne abin da zai fi faruwa.
The game went well.	Wasan ya tafi da kyau.
The way we prepare it.	A hanyar da muke shirya shi.
I think you understand it.	Ina tsammanin kun gane shi.
I can't think right.	Ba zan iya yin tunani daidai ba.
It gives way.	Yana ba da hanya.
At first I did not know who he was.	Da farko ban san ko wanene shi ba.
Give them.	Ka ba su.
Or, the car could be a problem.	Ko kuma, motar na iya zama matsala.
He remembers like yesterday.	Ya tuna kamar jiya.
It's all a joke.	Duk abin wasa ne.
This is for sure.	Wannan tabbas.
But there is a catch.	Amma akwai kama.
I say something, it says something.	Ina cewa wani abu, yana cewa wani abu.
It doesn’t feel like work.	Ba ya jin kamar aiki.
You love them more than you love yourself.	Kuna son su fiye da yadda kuke son kanku.
We saw enough after the first day.	Mun ga isa bayan rana ta farko.
But he and I were alone in the room.	Amma ni da shi kadai muke a dakin.
It's interesting.	Yana da ban sha'awa.
I will hate you if you keep me here.	Zan ƙi ku idan kun ajiye ni a nan.
I am doing well myself.	Ina yin kyau da kaina.
There is a car.	Akwai mota.
It's not that big of a deal.	Ba abu ne mai girma haka ba.
You know how they go.	Kun san yadda suke tafiya.
I hope it happens.	Ina fatan zai faru.
We did it.	Mun yi shi.
Who knows.	Wa ya sani.
But that is not right.	Amma hakan ba daidai ba ne.
He wants to move on.	Yana son ci gaba.
And no one is enough to show me.	Kuma babu wanda ya isa ya nuna mini.
Others went out.	Wasu kuma suka fita.
He almost said nothing.	Bai kusa cewa komai ba.
She is missing.	Ta bata.
That may come later, though.	Hakan na iya zuwa daga baya, ko da yake.
We want to see it grow.	Muna so mu ga ya girma.
But that will take more time and effort.	Amma hakan zai ɗauki ƙarin lokaci da ƙoƙari.
You are reading this correctly.	Kuna karanta wannan daidai.
But their food is good.	Amma abincin su yana da kyau.
She is.	Ita ce.
But they are there.	Amma suna can.
I get it slowly, but maybe not fast enough.	Ina samun shi a hankali, amma watakila ba sauri isa ba.
I feel like that.	Ina jin irin haka.
I have to keep going.	Dole na ci gaba.
Sleep deprivation is often a symptom of illness.	Yawan barci sau da yawa alama ce ta rashin lafiya.
We are happy to hear it.	Mun yi farin ciki da jin sa.
It will be checked tomorrow.	Za a duba shi gobe.
It looks like we are not here.	Kamar ma ba mu nan.
Please wait for me here.	Don Allah a jira ni a nan.
She is not weak or cut.	Ba ta da rauni ko yanke.
I'm not interested.	Ba na sha'awa.
I could not find the reason for this.	Na kasa gano dalilin hakan.
Everyone knows this will never happen.	Kowa ya san hakan ba zai taba faruwa ba.
Nor did he start calling.	Haka kuma bai fara kira ba.
Call someone for help.	Kira wani don taimako.
I did so.	Na yi haka.
Whatever they say, you know who you are.	Duk abin da za su ce, ka san ko kai wanene.
It's not about growing up.	Ba game da samun girma ba ne.
It was a good game, until the very end.	Ya kasance wasa mai kyau, har zuwa ƙarshe.
I can't remove it.	Ba zan iya cire shi ba.
I agree with the former.	Na yarda da abin da ya gabata.
It tests you.	Yana gwada ku.
Or to work.	Ko don aiki.
The event was sold out.	An sayar da taron.
I do not make much money.	Ba na samun kuɗi da yawa.
Simple but good.	Mai sauƙi amma mai kyau.
Things have changed a lot.	Abubuwa sun canza sosai.
It is his job.	Aikin sa ne.
They were arrested.	An kama su.
Just go and do it.	Kawai je ku yi.
And that is not a good thing.	Kuma wannan ba abu ne mai kyau ba.
He was.	Ya kasance.
I do not want to.	Ba na so ko.
Sold as it is.	An sayar kamar yadda yake.
The reason for this is not clear.	Dalilin da yasa ba a bayyana ba.
That, too, may work.	Wannan ma, yana iya aiki.
So a lot of people are going right.	Don haka mutane da yawa suna tafiya daidai.
And you laugh.	Kuma kuna dariya.
It just went on as usual.	Kawai an ci gaba kamar yadda aka saba.
No one believed her.	Ba wanda ya yarda da ita.
We could not bring it.	Ba mu iya kawo ta ba.
Maybe you will forget what is there too.	Wataƙila za ku manta abin yana can ma.
I can work it out.	Zan iya aiki da shi.
Now it came to him.	Yanzu ya zo masa.
So we will be happy homeowners.	Don haka za mu zama masu gida masu farin ciki.
If you have heard it once, you have heard it many times.	Idan kun ji sau ɗaya, kun ji sau da yawa.
Absolutely not.	A gaskiya a'a.
You! 	Kai!
Of course they do not like it.	Tabbas ba sa son shi.
closely!	a hankali!
You have to put this on yourself.	Dole ne ku sanya wannan a kan ku.
I used it a lot.	Na yi amfani da shi sosai.
That would be a good thing to do.	Wannan zai zama abu mai kyau a yi.
What a game.	Wane irin wasa ne.
I will never forget that.	Ba zan manta da hakan ba.
Maybe something real will happen tonight.	Wataƙila wani abu da gaske zai faru a daren yau.
We started talking.	Muka fara magana.
He just got up from there.	Kawai ya tashi daga can.
Please explain to me again.	Da fatan za a sake bayyana mani.
My player just to pass the time.	Dan wasa nawa kawai don wuce lokaci.
It will definitely recommend, and reuse.	Tabbas zai ba da shawarar, kuma a sake amfani da shi.
And sell it.	Kuma sayar da shi.
Cut early.	Yanke da wuri.
On the way home, we stopped to eat.	A hanyar gida, mun tsaya don cin abinci.
We feel we can be better than we used to be.	Muna jin za mu iya zama mafi kyau fiye da yadda muka kasance.
She is definitely right.	Babu shakka tana da gaskiya.
And now he would never let her go.	Kuma yanzu ba zai taba barin ta ta tafi ba.
At that point she didn’t care.	A wannan lokacin bata damu ba.
We are sick and tired of people like you.	Muna rashin lafiya kuma mun gaji da mutane irin ku.
They just.	Suna kawai.
You are absolutely truthful about nothing but the truth about it.	Kuna da gaskiya gaba ɗaya ba komai sai gaskiya akan hakan.
You still say no.	Har yanzu ka ce a'a.
And still scared.	Kuma har yanzu tsoro.
I did it carefully.	Na yi shi a hankali.
That's where he came from.	Daga nan ne ya fito.
This has never been done before.	Ba a taba yin hakan ba.
I did not participate.	Ban shiga haka ba.
It came right.	Ya zo daidai.
Their hopes began to rise.	Fatan su ya fara tashi.
We can just wait and see.	Za mu iya jira mu gani kawai.
No one did.	Babu wanda yayi.
In fact, he did not.	A gaskiya, bai yi ba.
I even need it.	Har ma ina bukatar ta.
But gradually everything changed.	Amma a hankali duk abin ya canza.
He lost his temper.	Ya bata hakuri.
I got out of everything.	Na fita daga komai.
You know, the bigger the better.	Ka sani, mafi girma shine mafi kyau.
Are they traveling together?	Tare suke tafiya?
It might be better though.	Zai iya zama mafi kyau ko da yake.
So it may not be very interesting.	Don haka yana iya zama ba abin sha'awa sosai ba.
That is what a person does.	Abin da mutum yake yi ke nan.
Let's try it for success.	Bari mu gwada shi don nasara.
Although he did not participate, it was a surprise.	Ko da yake bai shiga ba, abin mamaki ne.
That's right.	Hakan yayi daidai.
This is nothing new.	Wannan ba sabon abu bane.
He looks like this man.	Yana kama da wannan mutumin.
But that will not happen to me.	Amma hakan ba zai faru da ni ba.
Let's put this stuff on in the morning.	Bari mu sanya wannan kayan da safe.
There must be some error.	Dole ne a sami ɗan kuskure.
More things to forget.	Ƙarin abubuwan da za a manta.
Eat one and move on.	Ka ci daya ka ci gaba.
Sweet laughter.	Dariya mai dadi.
I think they know you are close.	Ina tsammanin sun san kuna kusa.
She doesn't have to use them.	Ba sai ta yi amfani da su ba.
I know they have not progressed.	Na san ba su ci gaba ba.
He said fear and hardship should lead to action.	Ya ce tsoro da wahala su kai ga aiki.
You probably do not know what he is doing there.	Da alama ba ku san abin da yake yi a can ba.
I have seen many.	Na gani da yawa.
She could even say the room was empty.	Har ta iya cewa dakin babu kowa.
He did not think of anything.	Bai yi tunanin komai ba.
Not common.	Ba na kowa ba.
I no longer know whether it is true or not.	Ban sake sanin ko gaskiya ne ko a'a.
He himself, was in it.	Shi da kansa, ya kasance a ciki.
It worked really well.	Ya yi aiki sosai.
People have learned a lot.	Mutane sun koyi abubuwa da yawa.
Food is a big problem though.	Abinci shine babban matsalar ko da yake.
We will continue and move forward together.	Za mu ci gaba kuma mu ci gaba tare.
We have never heard of such a thing.	Ba mu taba jin irin wannan abu ba.
It should be here.	Ya kamata a nan.
This is a new home.	Wannan sabon gida ne.
Also, these items are difficult or cannot be removed.	Haka kuma, waɗannan abubuwan suna da wahala ko ba za a iya cire su ba.
She was very tired, and she slept for a week.	Ta gaji sosai, ta yi barci har tsawon mako guda.
I have so many things to do.	Ina da abubuwa da yawa da zan yi.
But it will not stop.	Amma ba zai tsaya ba.
That will not change.	Wannan ba zai canza ba.
But, it is not just a journey.	Amma, ba tafiya kawai ba ce.
The man is great.	Mutumin yana da girma.
It's necessary.	Ya zama dole.
God appeared there.	Allah ya bayyana a wurin.
It was a symbol of the whole game.	Ya kasance alama ce ta gaba daya wasan.
He did not know how to defend himself.	Bai san yadda zai kare kansa ba.
I was surprised by the story.	Na yi mamakin labarin.
I always do that.	Kullum ina yin hakan.
If that is the case.	Idan har hakan ta tabbata.
You are working again.	Kuna sake aiki.
I tried to find out what was going on.	Na yi ƙoƙarin gano abin da ke faruwa.
But that should not be.	Amma da bai kamata ba.
She misses him.	Ta bata shi.
We are not going to talk about it.	Ba za mu yi magana game da shi ba.
He does not sleep with anyone.	Baya kwana da kowa.
I will go outside to check some things.	Zan fita waje don duba wasu abubuwa.
So tell me the truth.	Don haka gaya mani gaskiya.
Someone she knew, at least.	Wani da ta sani, ko kadan.
Have you tried them?	Shin kun gwada su?.
Please check.	Da fatan za a duba.
It's not fun.	Ba abin farin ciki ba ne.
He does not see it that way.	Ba ya ganin haka.
What we hear.	Abin da muke ji.
No day has arrived.	Babu ranar da ta isa.
Or just do it.	Ko kuma kawai ya yi.
Take care of the road but do not get on the boat.	Kula da hanya amma kada ku shiga cikin jirgin ruwa.
I'm very tired.	Na gaji sosai.
Not a big deal.	Ba wani babban abu ba ne.
He began to cry.	Kuka ya fara yi.
They may not want to participate.	Wataƙila ba za su so shiga ba.
It is a lie.	Karya ce.
We got up.	Mun tashi.
You have to be honest with yourself and be honest with us.	Dole ne ku kasance masu gaskiya ga kanku kuma ku kasance masu gaskiya tare da mu.
Kids are growing up fast here.	Yara suna girma da sauri a nan.
He did not come to her.	Bai zo mata ba.
I do not know what she is doing.	Ban san me take yi ba.
And boy, did you ever make a mistake?	Kuma yaro, ka taɓa yin kuskure.
You do not want the truth.	Ba ka son gaskiya.
She saw how they could be human.	Ta ga yadda za su zama mutane.
For he too can walk.	Don shi ma zai iya tafiya.
It looks amazing to the home.	Ga alama ban mamaki ga gida.
It is not a comfortable home.	Ba gida mai dadi ba ne.
Even some who have no name.	Da ma wasu da ba su da suna .
He does not need to be.	Ba ya bukatar zama.
That has happened in the past.	Hakan ya faru a baya.
There is an injury.	Akwai rauni .
He is always working.	Yana nan kullum yana aiki.
She would not let him go.	Ba za ta bari ya tafi ba.
I wonder if you know the way.	Na yi mamaki ko ka san hanya.
Many people do not know.	Mutane da yawa ba su sani ba.
This is not surprising, however.	Wannan ba abin mamaki ba ne, duk da haka.
They kill me.	Suna kashe ni.
Let me go, please.	Bari in tafi, don Allah.
I know who won.	Na san wanda ya yi nasara.
You and the players have done very well.	Kai da ’yan wasan sun yi kyau sosai.
Once upon a time.	Sau daya daya.
So it was with me.	Haka ya kasance tare da ni.
Let him think.	Bari ya yi tunani.
I just want to go to the movies.	Ina so in je fim ne kawai.
If you will.	Idan kuna so.
God help you.	Allah ya taimake ku.
That sounds good.	Yayi kyau haka.
I am on my way.	Ina kan hanya ta.
I should be one.	Ya kamata in zama daya.
They seem to have no interest in the project.	Sun zama kamar ba su da sha'awar aikin.
But she has to be careful and you have to stay, too.	Amma dole ne ta yi hankali kuma dole ne ku zauna, ma.
It brings others.	Yana kawo wasu.
They go out.	Suna fita.
Someone must activate them.	Dole ne wani ya kunna su.
This has never been done before.	Ba a taba yin haka ba.
I love you.	Son baka.
I did not sleep.	Ban yi barci ba.
It is very difficult.	Yana da matukar wahala.
So he pretended to forget.	Don haka sai ya yi kamar ya manta.
The food is delicious.	Abincin yana da dadi.
Any problem, that's it.	Duk wata matsala, shi ke nan.
I should do the same.	Ya kamata in yi haka kuma.
Feel the rain.	Jin ruwan sama.
It’s about what we do here.	Yana da game da abin da muke yi a nan.
Now let me get up.	Yanzu bari in tashi.
I don't think that will change.	Ba na jin hakan zai canza.
I can get it later from another house.	Zan iya samun shi daga baya daga wani gida.
God will meet the need in time.	Allah zai biya bukata cikin lokaci.
So, you don't spend anything.	Don haka, ba ku kashe komai.
Something here.	Wani abu a nan.
The place is so nice.	Wurin yana da kyau sosai.
You need a lot of things.	Kuna buƙatar abu mai yawa.
He is said to be an intelligent man.	An ce shi mutum ne mai hankali.
Of course they can.	Tabbas suna iya.
One should not eat food from a crocodile.	Kada mutum ya ci abinci daga kada.
Everyone will work for the best.	Duk zai yi aiki don mafi kyau.
But he did not.	Amma bai yi haka ba.
Our minds are running.	Tunanin mu yana gudu.
After that we took a lot of time together.	Bayan haka mun dauki lokaci mai yawa tare.
He fought.	Ya yi fada.
They continue to smoke.	Suna ci gaba da shan taba.
I want to accept it.	Ina son yarda da ita.
She was very close to where she was.	Ta kusa kusa da inda take.
That would be interesting.	Wannan zai zama mai ban sha'awa.
Not much, it seems.	Ba yawa, ya zama kamar.
I would be sick here.	Zan yi rashin lafiya a nan.
A lot has been done to see.	An yi abubuwa da yawa don gani.
They are right.	Suna da gaskiya.
Maybe in another movie.	Wataƙila a wani fim ɗin.
It is amazing how one is accustomed to it.	Abin mamaki yadda mutum ya saba da shi.
He did not do it now.	Bai yi yanzu ba.
I think about that a lot.	Ina tunani game da hakan da yawa.
Little by little.	Kadan kadan.
I have not learned anything new from this.	Ban koyi wani sabon abu daga wannan ba.
He could not get a job in a film.	Ya kasa samun aiki a fim.
Give him a chance to test himself.	Ka ba shi dama ya gwada kansa.
I really, really did.	Na gaske, da gaske na yi.
Do this carefully.	Yi wannan a hankali.
This is not the case.	Wannan ba haka bane.
I don't want to talk later.	Bana son yin magana daga baya.
They sold well.	Sun sayar da kyau.
Absolutely.	Gaba ɗaya gaba ɗaya.
They will come back right.	Za su dawo daidai.
And from the money.	Kuma daga kudi.
I further fall into this.	Na kara fada cikin wannan.
It looks so good on her.	Yayi mata kyau sosai.
Some know this better than others.	Wasu sun fi wasu sanin hakan.
He had seen the man come home with the girls several times in the past.	Ya taba ganin mutumin ya zo gida da 'yan mata sau da yawa a baya.
He is still here.	Har yanzu yana nan.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
Please check.	Da fatan za a duba.
There is good talk.	Akwai magana mai kyau.
Things will work out.	Abubuwa za su yi aiki.
We'd better go ahead.	Gara mu ci gaba.
They would rather die than die.	Gara su mutu da ita.
It should be prepared to work immediately.	Ya kamata a shirya don yin aiki nan da nan.
Each child will be given hot meals at school.	Za a ba wa kowane yaro abinci mai zafi a makaranta.
I know exactly what will happen.	Na san ainihin abin da zai faru.
But remember, it is even bigger.	Amma ka tuna, ya ma fi haka girma.
He could not do anything.	Ya kasa zama bai yi komai ba.
If she’s right, she can’t be here.	Idan ta yi gaskiya, ba zai iya zama a nan ba.
Ku, ku, ku.	Ku, ku, ku.
But they were good to work with.	Amma sun kasance masu kyau don aiki tare da.
Whatever it should be called, it fits.	Duk abin da ya kamata a kira shi, ya dace da shi.
This will help things out.	Wannan zai taimaka abubuwa fita.
We got the money.	Mun samu kudi.
I think she is here.	Ina jin tana nan.

There is something else, 'she added.	Akwai wani abu kuma,' ta kara da cewa.
She was very close to them.	Ta kasance tare da su sosai.
Ever since he was a child.	Tun yana yaro.
It is true, of course.	Yana da gaskiya, ba shakka.
You can use the money to buy a home.	Kuna iya amfani da kuɗin don siyan gida.

He should not have died that way.	Bai kamata ya mutu haka ba.
Thus.	Ta haka ne.
Exactly on time.	Yayi daidai akan lokaci.
Do you think you will be back next year?	Kuna tsammanin za ku sake zuwa shekara mai zuwa?
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
We want to ask him but we can not.	Muna so mu tambaye shi amma ba za mu iya ba.
Sorry to write that.	Yi hakuri ka rubuta haka.
I have it too sometimes.	Ina da shi ma wani lokacin.
She should have known better.	Ya kamata ta fi sani.
Read this book.	Karanta wannan littafin.
The same goes for women.	Haka kuma mata.
I talk to him a lot.	Ina yi masa magana da yawa.
He did not know how to laugh or cry.	Bata san dariya ko kuka ba.
She left.	Ta tafi.
Although not much.	Ko da yake ba da yawa ba.
He was amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
This is the seat, the place to be seen.	Wannan shi ne wurin zama, wurin da za a gani.
Maybe even leave it.	Watakila ma bar shi.
I'm sure I'll try it.	Na tabbata zan gwada shi.
Years spent is nothing.	Shekaru da aka kashe ba komai.
There is something there.	Akwai wani abu a can.
Or what do you think.	Ko me kuke tunani.
I have to keep living.	Dole na ci gaba da rayuwa.
Time passed quickly.	Lokaci ya wuce da sauri.
I was a little surprised.	Na fi ɗan mamaki.
We must kill him immediately.	Dole ne mu kashe shi nan da nan.
He stopped at a gas station.	Ya tsaya a wani gidan mai.
He is with them.	Yana tare da su.
No one should be in the latter.	Babu wanda ya kamata ya kasance a cikin na ƙarshe.
I will get back to you on that.	Zan dawo gare ku akan hakan.
You will get your money back.	Za ku dawo da kuɗin ku.
And save the day.	Kuma ajiye ranar.
Please let me be with you.	Don Allah bari in kasance tare da ku.
I think nothing.	Ina tsammanin ba komai.
For many people it is both.	Ga mutane da yawa duka biyu ne.
And they tell each other what they want about each other.	Kuma suna gaya wa juna abin da suke so game da wani.
Work if you can.	Yi aiki idan za ku iya.
This is what I am trying to do.	Abin da nake ƙoƙarin yi ke nan.
But that will come later.	Amma hakan zai zo daga baya.
At night.	A cikin dare.
I will save it.	Zan ajiye shi.
I thought so.	Na yi tsammanin haka.
We need to be serious about these things.	Muna bukatar mu yi magana da gaske game da waɗannan abubuwan.
I want it for me.	Ina so a gare ni.
This, after all, is a game.	Wannan, bayan haka, wasa ne.
He did not return.	Bata dawo ba.
I made up a good drink.	Na gyara mani abin sha mai kyau.
Maybe I know something that can help you.	Wataƙila na san wani abu da zai iya taimaka muku.
It looks good inside.	Ya yi kyau a ciki.
Can you think of anything?	Kuna iya tunanin wani abu?.
But, in general, it does not.	Amma, gaba ɗaya, ba ya yi.
I talked to them.	Na yi magana da su.
Maybe I was with him.	Wataƙila na kasance tare da shi.
This can do.	Wannan zai iya yi.
The night is cold.	Dare yayi sanyi.
We are not saying that.	Ba muna cewa haka ba.
The others are gone.	Sauran sun tafi.
No one knows how to do it.	Babu wanda ya san yadda ake yin hakan.
They know what we are up to.	Sun san abin da muke ciki.
Until you finish it, you will never get this article.	Har sai kun gama shi, ba za ku taɓa samun wannan labarin ba.
I definitely give them all the time on the road.	Lallai ina ba su kowane lokaci akan hanya.
It was difficult for most kids, but we got it.	Ya kasance da wahala ga yara mafi yawa, amma mun samu ta.
No, no problem.	A'a, ba matsala.

That's good.	Hakan yayi kyau.
They come to him.	Suna zuwa gare shi.
It's a good effort but I need some work.	Ƙoƙari ne mai kyau amma ina buƙatar wani aiki.
But not like that.	Amma ba kamar wannan ba.
This is not like him either.	Wannan ma ba kamar shi ba ne.
He was not even surprised.	Bai ma yi mamaki ba.
Like nothing they have seen before.	Kamar ba abin da suka gani a baya.
He was funny.	Ya kasance mai ban dariya.
Therefore, a lot of time and work is required.	Saboda haka, ana buƙatar lokaci mai yawa da aiki.
I will stay with her.	Zan zauna da ita.
I will leave you two alone.	Zan bar ku biyu ku kaɗai.
Growth is not necessarily good.	Girma ba lallai bane yayi kyau.
You can't talk.	Ba za ku iya magana ba.
It is a real mistake.	Kuskure ne na gaskiya.
To get more.	Don samun ƙarin.
I have to get out of here.	Dole ne in fita daga nan.
Some women.	Wasu mata.
Express your thoughts.	Nuna tunanin ku.
Two things can happen.	Abubuwa biyu na iya faruwa.
Such a pleasure.	Irin wannan jin daɗi.
Trust me, it won't work.	Ku yarda da ni, ba zai yi aiki ba.
There are so many.	Akwai shi da yawa.
He has a good hand.	Yana da hannu mai kyau.
And here we are again.	Kuma ga mu kuma.
It can't be that way.	Ba za a iya zama haka ba.
We just won’t do it.	Mu kawai ba za mu yi ba.
You can live in the world and still make time.	Kuna iya zama a cikin duniya kuma har yanzu kuna yin lokaci.
Someone will pay me, as usual.	Wani zai biya ni, kamar yadda ya saba.
For many, the road has been very hot.	Ga mutane da yawa, hanyar ta kasance mai zafi sosai.
I want to make time.	Ina so in yi lokaci.
No one else.	Babu wani kuma.
Everyone looked.	Kowa ya duba.
I hear them.	Ina jin su.
This is the way to turn it on.	Wannan ita ce hanyar kunna shi.
I looked around the room.	Na kalli dakin.
I hope she grows up.	Ina fatan ta yi girma.
The people came and went.	Mutane sun zo, suka tafi.
I want the two of them together.	Ina son su biyu tare.
It appeared to me that she was right.	Ya bayyana a gare ni cewa ta yi gaskiya.
It feels like a missed opportunity.	Yana jin kamar damar da aka rasa.
I came back for help.	Na dawo don samun taimako.
They know what they know.	Sun san abin da suka sani.
You must study at home.	Dole ne ku yi karatu a gida.
He was shocked, and could not understand it.	Abin mamaki ne, kuma ya kasa gane hakan.
I will be around.	Zan kasance a kusa.
I have no problem with this.	Ban sami matsala da wannan ba.
You must know this.	Dole ne ku san wannan.
Kids love it.	Yara suna son shi.
Access is very exciting.	Samun dama yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
She didn't really understand.	Ba ta gane sosai ba.
We will talk to them.	Za mu yi magana da su.
I want to finish homework before meal time.	Ina so in gama aikin gida kafin lokacin cin abinci.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
He showed me.	Ya nuna min.
Now we are sure it is open.	Yanzu mun tabbatar a bude yake.
I could not figure out exactly what to do.	Ba zan iya gano ainihin abin da zan yi ba.
Go home.	Ka tafi gida.
We want to get out of here.	Muna so mu fita daga nan.
It can work with this.	Zai iya aiki da wannan.
Only, things went wrong.	Kawai, abubuwa sun yi kuskure.
Please, come.	Don Allah, zo.
That made me a little sick.	Hakan ya sa na dan ji zafi.
Things will be difficult, but you will succeed.	Abubuwa za su yi wuya, amma za ku yi nasara.
Whatever they need, they will get.	Duk abin da suke bukata, za su samu.
Of course it makes you want to go there !.	Tabbas yana sa ku so ku je can!.
But it is not true.	Amma ba gaskiya ba ne.
One of two probably.	Daya daga cikin biyu tabbas.
But not everyone is happy.	Amma ba kowa ne ke samun farin ciki ba.
I think you know that too.	Ina tsammanin kun san hakan ma.
Let's think about it for a moment.	Bari mu yi tunanin hakan na ɗan lokaci.
No answer.	Bata amsa ba.
You didn't give him anything.	Ba ka bashi komai ba.
The rest is here.	Sauran yana nan.
And she did not give up.	Kuma ba ta daina ba.
No one will ever do that.	Babu wanda zai taɓa yin hakan.
That's fine, he said.	Yayi kyau, yace.
Never again.	Kada a sake.
He is alone.	Shi kadai ne.
Or for happiness.	Ko don farin ciki.
Everything went well.	Komai ya tafi lafiya.
I feel very comfortable.	Ina jin dadi sosai.
We do not know him.	Ba mu san shi ba.
If nothing else.	Idan babu komai .
But it is faster than cutting.	Amma ya fi gudu da yanke.
I would not be here otherwise.	Ba zan kasance a nan in ba haka ba.
It worked well.	Yayi aiki da kyau.
But he did it right.	Amma ya yi daidai.
I was immediately very tired.	Nan take na gaji sosai.
It can protect.	Zai iya kare.
Everyone is waiting for the signal.	Kowa ya jira alama.
Very good.	Da kyau da yawa.
We have been in this period for almost a year.	Mun kasance a cikin wannan lokacin kusan shekara guda.
I am there now.	Ina can yanzu.
But come on.	Amma zo.
But three times.	Amma sau uku.
We thought it was a mistake.	Mun ɗauka cewa kuskure ne.
It came out well.	Ya fito da kyau.
I knew he would hit the fly out of me.	Na san zai buga tashi daga gare ni.
They make mistakes.	Suna yin kuskure.
And you are gone.	Kuma kun tafi.
I understand why you have to do this.	Na fahimci dalilin da ya sa dole ka yi wannan.
Fix a little.	Gyara kadan.
She did it.	Ta yi shi.
This will tell you.	Wannan zai gaya muku.
I can't find it, either.	Ba zan iya samun shi ba, ko.
And it is life.	Kuma ita ce rayuwa.
They like to eat there.	Suna son cin abinci a can.
He was a wonderful reader from beginning to end.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki karatu daga farko har ƙarshe.
He told me to call the police.	Ya ce min ya kira ‘yan sanda.
But that's all.	Amma haka kawai.
Everything works fine.	Komai yana aiki sosai.
Finally he is here.	A ƙarshe yana nan.
I read it and it did things for me.	Na karanta shi kuma ya yi mini abubuwa.
I'm looking for you	Ina neman ku
I hope you all like it.	Ina fatan duk kuna son shi.
But that did not happen.	Amma ba haka ya faru ba.
The reason is simple.	Dalilin yana da sauƙi mai sauƙi.
Otherwise, she has nothing.	In ba haka ba, ba ta da komai.
The water is not hot yet.	Ruwan bai cika zafi ba tukuna.
The fear is gone.	Tsoro ya tafi.
You say so.	Kun ce haka .
So far it has started to run very fast.	Zuwa yanzu an fara gudu sosai.
Whether or not they do, and they are not.	Ko ba su yi ba, kuma ba haka suke ba.
We need another way.	Muna buƙatar wata hanya.
I want you to touch me	Ina son ku ta ni
You can give it time.	Kuna iya ba shi lokaci.
He knows no one will hear him.	Ya san babu wanda zai ji shi.
We got up early.	Mun tashi da wuri.
I only know the person.	Na san mutumin kawai.
Sometimes they succeed.	Wani lokaci sun yi nasara.
The method is poor and has not been identified.	Hanyar ba ta da kyau kuma ba a gano ta ba.
Nothing and no one has ever been one.	Babu wani abu kuma babu wanda ya taɓa zama ɗaya.
She really enjoys being around.	Lallai tana jin daɗin zama a kusa.
Not much opportunity for him to go.	Ba dama da yawa a gare shi ya tafi.
So it was written, so it will pass.	Don haka aka rubuta, don haka zai wuce.
I mean, it's the best place in the world.	Ina kamar, shine wuri mafi kyau a duniya.
She moved to another lifeboat.	Ta koma wani jirgin rayuwa.
His clothes are not comfortable.	Rigar sa ba ta da kyau.
This is amazing.	Wannan abin ban mamaki ne.
We know how to live.	Mun san yadda ake rayuwa.
I enjoyed talking to her, trust me.	Na ji daɗin magana da ita, ku yarda da ni.
She would not do that.	Ba za ta yi hakan ba.
It may be useful to others as well.	Wataƙila yana iya zama da amfani ga wasu kuma.
They will kill.	Za su kashe.
So you are right.	Don haka kuna gaskiya.
Now with that.	Yanzu da cewa.
It tells us that no one can find any fish.	Yana gaya mana cewa babu wanda zai iya samun wani kifi.
How beautiful!	Yaya kyau!
That's my door.	Bude na ke kenan.
But he is in trouble.	Amma yana cikin matsala.
But if she does.	Amma idan ta yi.
So there is not much thought going on.	Don haka babu yawan tunani da ke faruwa.
He wanted to go back to work.	Ya so ya koma bakin aiki.
Things are still not easy.	Har yanzu abubuwa ba su da sauƙi.
She never cried	Bata taba kuka ba
He quickly returned.	Da sauri ya koma.
We passed it and on it.	Mun wuce shi kuma a kan shi.
There is nothing new in this.	Babu wani sabon abu a cikin wannan.
He is still alive.	Har yanzu bai mutu ba.
So, we did it.	Don haka, mun yi shi.
What would you like to drink?	Me ake so a sha?
He repaired the seat immediately.	Ya gyara zama nan take.
He learned that he could make mistakes.	Ya koyi cewa zai iya yin kuskure.
And it keeps growing.	Kuma yana ci gaba da girma.
I know only time.	Na san lokaci ne kawai.
It feels like he came there in the first place.	Ji yake kamar ya zo can tun farko.
He did not return.	Bai dawo ba.
We will act as if we have not seen.	Za mu yi kamar ba mu gani ba.
They will come soon.	Za su zo nan da nan.
Why, he is not sure.	Don me, bai tabbata ba.
Two things.	Abubuwa biyu.
This is the only thing they can do.	Wannan shi ne kawai abin da za su iya yi.
True or not.	Gaskiya ne ko a'a.
But she will.	Amma za ta.
I want to know what it is.	Ina so in san abin da yake.
A year later things changed dramatically.	Bayan shekara guda abin ya canza sosai.
But she was wrong.	Amma ta yi kuskure.
Her dress is beautiful.	Rigar ta ta yi kyau.
That day may come.	Wannan ranar na iya zuwa.
If it can be changed, it will be.	Idan za a iya canza shi, zai kasance.
I do not hate it.	Ba na ƙi shi.
That must be fixed this year.	Dole ne a gyara hakan a bana.
Which can happen completely.	Wanda zai iya faruwa gaba daya.
There is still much to be said, but it can wait.	Har yanzu akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a faɗa, amma yana iya jira.
Do it with me.	Yi da ni.
It works well to be just that.	Yana aiki da kyau don zama haka kawai.
If it’s good, forget it.	Idan yana da kyau, manta da shi.
I agree.	Na kan yarda.
You are wrong.	Kun yi kuskure.
Everything has changed.	Duk abin ya canza.
I am sick of rain.	Ina rashin lafiya da ruwan sama.
See you tomorrow!.	Sai gobe!.
Buy the material.	Sayi kayan.
I don't have many.	Bani da dama.
It's time to dump her.	Lokacin tafiya yayi.
I am fine.	Ina lafiya.
You can't save everyone you see.	Ba za ku iya ajiye duk wanda kuke gani ba.
I don't want you to come back.	Ba na son ku dawo.
No one is talking to each other.	Ba wanda ke magana da juna.
He did not think that would be a problem.	Bai yi tunanin hakan zai zama matsala ba.
The problem with this is, too.	Matsalar wannan ita ce, ya yi yawa.
As you can imagine.	Kamar yadda kuke tunani.
Many people do not live well.	Mutane da yawa ba sa rayuwa mai kyau.
She did not know what to do.	Bata san me zata yi ba.
They are not paid much.	Ba a biya su da yawa.
No one has ever been sure.	Babu wanda ya taba tabbata.
We want to crash.	Muna son yin karo.
To hear it.	Don jin shi.
I was amazing in every way.	Na ban mamaki ta kowace hanya.
He did not have to suffer.	Ba sai ya yi wahala ba.
Maybe they haven't come back yet.	Wataƙila ba su dawo ba tukuna.
We will take care of them.	Za mu kula da su.
I am working with you.	Ina aiki tare da ku.
He is not such a person.	Ba irin wannan mutumin bane.
He did not let her go.	Bai bari ya tafi ba.
He got into a lot of debt.	Ya shiga bashi sosai.
Otherwise, you would not have stood up and talked to me.	In ba haka ba, da ba za ku tashi ku yi magana da ni ba.
This is a lie.	Wannan karya ne.
What's going on.	Me ke faruwa.
He laughed a lot.	Yayi dariya sosai.
So she was killed last night.	Don haka aka kashe ta a daren jiya.
They want to tell the story of how they met.	Suna son ba da labarin yadda suka hadu.
Suddenly, she began to think differently.	Nan take abin ya fara mata hankali.
Or maybe with.	Ko watakila tare da.
That may surprise some people.	Hakan na iya zama abin mamaki ga wasu mutane.
Maybe we thought there was no need for two people crying.	Wataƙila mun yi tunanin cewa babu buƙatar mutane biyu suna kuka.
But it never felt like work.	Amma ba a taɓa jin kamar aiki ba.
Until tonight.	Har zuwa wannan dare.
Imagine if someone knew, it would be.	Ka yi tunanin idan wani ya sani, ya zama shi ne.
I think that's it.	Ina tsammanin shi ke nan.
I want people to be taken care of.	Ina son a kula da mutane.
I'm trying to write it.	Ina ƙoƙarin rubuta shi.
He knew what she wanted.	Ya san abin da take so.
I knew at the time everyone was listening.	Na san a lokacin kowa ya ji.
It does not come twice.	Ba ya zuwa sau biyu.
I may be the last.	Zan iya zama na ƙarshe.
I like that.	Na so hakan.
He looked like a good kid, though.	Ya zama kamar yaro mai kyau, ko da yake.
We talked and we talked.	Muka yi magana muka yi magana.
She did not answer.	Ta bata amsa.
He is on my guard.	Yana kan kare na.
But they know that.	Amma sun san haka.
It appears he has.	Ya bayyana yana da.
It can be anyone.	Zai iya zama kowa.
They will never see it again.	Ba za su taba gani ba.
He has been coming for a long time.	Ya dade yana zuwa.
It hasn't changed much.	Bata canza sosai ba.
There are a few facts.	Akwai 'yan gaskiya.
They could not stay here.	Ba su iya zama a nan ba.
I hated when she did this.	Na ƙi lokacin da ta yi wannan.
Others think so.	Wasu kuma suna tunanin haka.
You certainly should not work.	Lallai bai kamata ku yi aiki ba.
Maybe it's time to move on.	Wataƙila lokaci ya yi da za a ci gaba.
She does not know anyone there, and no one knows her.	Ba ta san kowa a wurin ba, kuma ba wanda ya san ta.
That would be better.	Hakan zai fi kyau.
He almost killed me.	Ya kusa kashe ni.
I hate that place.	Na ƙi wannan wurin.
I hope you like it.	Ina fatan za ku so.
Everyone appears to have another.	Kowa ya bayyana yana da wani.
No one is happy about that.	Ba wanda ya yi farin ciki da wannan.
It just feels good.	Yana jin daɗi kawai.
He got no answer.	Bai samu amsa ba.
I think it more than that no one can.	Ina tunanin shi fiye da cewa babu wanda zai iya.
Everything was great.	Komai ya zama mai girma.
No one has ever touched me.	Babu wani mutum da ya taɓa ni.
How can that be said.	Yaya aka ce haka.
However, they look happy and excited.	Duk da haka, sun yi kama da farin ciki da farin ciki.
Times have changed, people have changed.	Lokaci ya canza, mutane sun canza.
This is not a success.	Wannan ba nasara ba ce.
They are right.	Suna daidai.
No, never, never.	Ba, taba, taba.
Please stay close.	Da fatan za ku zauna a kusa.
They are things.	Abubuwa ne.
Actually I am a human being.	A gaskiya ni mutum ne.
To do everything needed to keep going.	Don yin duk abin da ake bukata don ci gaba da tafiya.
I hope that is true.	Ina fatan hakan gaskiya ne.
She should not have left the house.	Bai kamata ta bar gidan ba.
That almost killed the book.	Hakan ya kusan kashe littafin.
Second wait, this is good.	Jira na biyu, wannan yana da kyau.
You do a great job.	Kuna yin babban aiki.
You will hate it.	Za ku ƙi shi.
Let's not forget them.	Kada mu manta da su.
He got something for everything.	Ya samu wani abu ga komai.
It seems to have changed.	Da alama ya canza.
People have forgotten that.	Mutane sun manta da hakan.
But be careful.	Amma a kula.
Life does not have to be this way.	Haka rayuwa bata yi ba.
I put everything in it.	Na sanya komai a ciki.
Interesting makes us very happy.	Abin sha'awa yana ba mu farin ciki sosai.
They are amazing people.	Mutane ne masu ban mamaki.
And she is not alone.	Kuma ba ita kadai ba.
The water reached her knees.	Ruwan ya kai mata gwiwa.
She will be tired.	Zata gaji.
He knows the day has come.	Ya san ranar ta zo.
I try to think back to everything that happened to me.	Ina ƙoƙarin yin tunani a baya ga duk abin da ya faru da ni.
So he was surprised to hear the news.	Don haka sai ya yi mamaki da ya ji labarin.
It feels real.	Yana jin gaske.
But really, it could be anything.	Amma da gaske, yana iya zama wani abu.
She knew and she knew he knew.	Ta sani kuma ta san ya sani.
But it’s sick, amazing.	Amma rashin lafiya ne, abin ban mamaki.
It does not.	Ba ya yi.
I can't live like that anymore.	Ba zan iya rayuwa haka ba kuma.
About the rest of the night.	Game da sauran dare.
She has to get out of here.	Dole ta fita daga nan.
Just to get used to life.	Don kawai ka saba da rayuwa.
This may sound simple, but it is not.	Wannan na iya zama mai sauƙi, amma ba haka ba ne.
As we did.	Kamar yadda muka yi.
He made it clear that he would never fall on his knees.	Ya bayyana cewa ba zai taba yin kasa a gwiwa ba.
I love you so much.	Ina son ku sosai.
Looking for food is fighting.	Neman abinci fada ne.
They want to buy a new dog.	Sun so saya sabon kare.
But he immediately began to wear it.	Amma nan da nan ya fara sa masa.
He came here yesterday	Ya zo nan jiya
I found this here.	Na sami wannan a nan.
He did very well for us.	Ya yi mana kyau sosai.
In fact, they did not.	A gaskiya, ba su yi ba.
Wow, it really makes sense.	Kai, yana da hankali sosai.
They were very useful.	Sun kasance ainihin amfani.
Don't tell us anything, you know.	Kada ka gaya mana komai, ka sani.
I wonder if anyone can take me to it.	Ina mamakin kowa zai iya kai ni gare ta.
We should use everything available.	Ya kamata mu yi amfani da duk abin da ke akwai.
This man has one daughter.	Wannan mutumin yana da 'ya daya.
This is the first time I have not been home.	Wannan ne karo na farko da ba na gida.
It did not go as planned.	Bai tafi yadda ya zata ba.
I have never said such a thing to anyone.	Ban taba yin irin wannan magana ga kowa ba.
She forgot that.	Ta manta da haka.
It can still work.	Har yanzu yana iya aiki.
I know this place very well.	Na san wannan wurin da kyau.
I looked at the door.	Na kalli kofar.
We are ready to hit the road.	Mun shirya don buga hanya.
I have them all over the house.	Ina da su a duk gidan.
They look at the man really.	Suna kallon mutumin da gaske.
To see if you have changed.	Don ganin ko kun canza.
Someone should show me the right way.	Ya kamata wani ya nuna mani hanyar da ta dace.
Then they run away.	Bayan haka sai suka gudu.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
I can't eat or sleep.	Ba zan iya ci ko barci ba.
I worked hard.	Na yi aiki sosai.
And if something can happen, it's good.	Kuma idan wani abu zai iya faruwa, hakan yayi kyau.
But somehow nothing.	Amma ko ta yaya ba komai.
I wanted to prove myself.	Na so in tabbatar da kaina.
I took the water and filled it.	Na dauki ruwan na cika shi.
This is something new for me.	Wannan sabon abu ne a gare ni.
Maybe this is a little true for him.	Wataƙila wannan yana da ɗan gaskiya gare shi.
This is a problem, but a good one.	Wannan matsala ce, amma mai kyau.
In fact, she was.	A gaskiya ma, ta kasance.
This book is on how to get there.	Wannan littafin yana kan yadda ake isa can.
Now, bigger and bigger.	Yanzu, mafi girma kuma mafi girma.
I have to get this.	Dole ne in sami wannan.
Be honest and express your feelings.	Ku kasance masu gaskiya kuma ku bayyana yadda kuke ji.
We have proven the same way now.	Mun tabbatar da hanya guda a yanzu.
But we are too late.	Amma mun wuce lokaci.
We need to get them all here.	Muna buƙatar samun su duka a nan.
I myself do not know.	Ni kaina ban sani ba.
He has helped us all so far.	Ya taimake mu duka har zuwa wannan lokacin.
He is the best dog.	Shi ne mafi kyawun kare.
Things like this happen once a year.	Abubuwan da ke faruwa irin wannan suna faruwa sau ɗaya a shekara.
It's just true.	Gaskiya ce kawai.
Without it, they would not be able to function.	Idan ba tare da shi ba, ba za su iya yin aiki ba.
Only two people.	Mutane biyu ne kawai.
Can anyone explain to me why this is happening?	Wani zai iya bayyana min dalilin da yasa hakan ke faruwa?.
I do not know how to do you can not help.	Ban san yadda zan yi ba za ku iya taimaka.
Hopefully it will continue to eat.	Da fatan za a ci gaba da ci.
No one will take it.	Babu wanda zai dauka.
This is what will happen.	Wannan shi ne abin da zai faru.
People are still talking about food.	Har yanzu mutane suna magana game da abinci.
It is not right to kill someone.	Ba daidai ba ne da kashe mutum.
I know him a little.	Na san shi kadan.
But that is correct.	Amma hakan yayi daidai.
This is more of a problem for me.	Wannan ya fi mini matsala.
How long have they been married?	Har yaushe suka yi aure?
Otherwise it does the right thing.	In ba haka ba yana yin daidai.
This can be easily demonstrated.	Ana iya nuna wannan cikin sauƙi.
Women sometimes still do.	Mata wani lokacin har yanzu suna yi.
But of course.	Amma ba shakka.
She can walk very well.	Ta iya tafiya sosai.
Check back, if you like.	Koma ka duba, in kana so.
I'm sure this time.	Na tabbata wannan lokacin.
You can use it every day of the day only.	Kuna iya amfani da kowace rana ta wannan ranar kawai.
I know you won't mind.	Na san ba za ku damu ba.
That's right now.	Haka yake yanzu.
It doesn't matter what others say.	Ba komai wasu suka ce.
I myself have seen something amazing.	Ni kaina na ga abin ban mamaki.
And sometimes if you have children, eat early.	Kuma wani lokacin idan kana da yara, ka ci abinci da wuri.
I do not want to go back to that.	Bana so in koma ga hakan.
I refuse to think.	Na ƙi yin tunani.
Feeling like things will never get better.	Jin kamar abubuwa ba za su taɓa yin kyau ba.
She would never do it.	Ba za ta taɓa yi ba.
We can talk about that.	Za mu iya magana game da hakan.
There is no big player in the world.	Babu wani babban dan wasa na duniya.
He was great in what he did.	Ya kasance mai girma a cikin abin da ya yi.
She got up early as usual.	Ta tashi da wuri kamar yadda ta saba.
I will continue to do so.	Zan ci gaba da haka.
You will not miss anything.	Ba za ku rasa komai ba.
So we act like people.	Don haka za mu yi kamar mutane.
There is nothing to play with.	Babu wani abu da za a yi wasa da shi.
We do not even know for sure.	Har ma ba mu san tabbas ba.
No active work.	Babu aiki mai aiki.
Do not tell anyone.	Kar a gaya wa kowa.
She really doesn't want to go there.	Lallai bata son zuwa wurin.
The surprise, really, is that it will work.	Abin mamaki, da gaske, shine da zai yi aiki.
Something a lot.	Wani abu mai yawa sosai.
He tried really hard.	Ya gwada sosai.
No one is coming.	Babu mai zuwa.
Can you come soon?	Za ku iya zuwa nan da nan?
I think some would think so.	Ina tsammanin wasu za su yi tunanin haka ne.
He wants to remove.	Yana so ya cire.
I did not see anything wrong.	Ban ga wani abu ba daidai ba.
He lost himself inside.	Ya rasa kansa a ciki.
It is uncertain.	Ba shi da tabbas.
Even that makes them go.	Ko da wannan ya sa su tafi.
They did not come here to do so.	Ba su zo nan don yin hakan ba.
He will learn to kill them.	Zai koyi kashe su.
He tried again to want the world to change, and nothing happened.	Ya sake ƙoƙarin son duniya ta canza, kuma babu abin da ya faru.
They are three.	Su uku ne.
I want to stay here	Ina son zama a nan
A lot of time has passed!	Lokaci mai yawa ya wuce!
Everything is gone.	Komai ya tafi.
I think he was talking to everyone.	Ina tsammanin yana magana da kowa.
But you do not have to be.	Amma ba dole ba ne ka kasance.
And it gets easier and easier on a daily basis.	Kuma ya sami sauƙi da sauƙi a kullum.
That will never happen.	Hakan ba zai taba faruwa ba.
Now is the day.	Yanzu ita ce ranar.
This time, he felt something to give.	Wannan lokacin, ya ji wani abu ya ba.
How how how.	Yadda yadda yadda.
This can be a simple game.	Wannan yana iya zama wasa mai sauƙi.
I need to hear it.	Ina bukata in ji shi.
It is an exciting time for us now.	Lokaci ne mai daɗi a gare mu yanzu.
Everyone wants us to fail.	Kowa ya so mu yi rashin nasara.
However, that's for me.	Duk da haka, shi ke gare ni.
They acted voluntarily.	Sun yi aiki da son rai.
OK, somewhat.	Ya yi, da ɗan.
I'm sure they are.	Na tabbata suna.
Many attempts have been made to find it.	An yi ƙoƙari da yawa don gano shi.
Outside of himself, he was all.	A waje da kansa, duk ya kasance.
I sleep a lot.	Ina barci da yawa.
Today, no one is smart.	A yau, babu wanda yake da hankali.
From someone.	Daga wani.
You really made me walk.	Da gaske kun sa ni tafiya.
He always goes to school.	Kullum yana tafiya makaranta.
Victory	Nasara
Maybe they would do better.	Wataƙila za su yi kyau da hakan.
I'll start tomorrow.	Zan fara gobe.
But he refused.	Amma bai yarda ba.
We would have bought them all too.	Da mun sayi duka su ma.
She is like you, you know.	Ita ce irin ku, ku sani.
So you are with me, or you are against me.	Don haka kuna tare da ni, ko kuma kuna gaba da ni.
I gave him the money.	Na ba shi kuɗin.
It seems that he too can continue.	Da alama shi ma zai iya ci gaba.
We are back to where we started.	Mun dawo inda muka fara.
Second, you have the opportunity to go.	Na biyu, kuna da damar da za ku tafi.
He went out.	Ya fita.
This we also know.	Wannan mu ma mun sani.
It happens, yes.	Yana faruwa, haka ne.
Maybe we can save some yet.	Wataƙila muna iya ajiye wasu tukuna.
He began to think of traveling.	Ya fara tunanin tafiya.
Otherwise the place looks like that.	In ba haka ba wurin ya yi kama da haka.
Many children do not go to school.	Yara da yawa ba su je makaranta ba.
It will be helpful.	Zai zama taimako.
He is now well.	Yanzu ya samu lafiya.
Everyone wants to.	Kowa yana so.
You need it, they have it.	Kuna buƙatar shi, suna da shi.
So this story is fake.	Don haka wannan labarin karya ne.
She couldn't think of that.	Ta kasa tunanin hakan.
He did not accept them.	Bai yarda da su ba.
She was hot.	Ta kasance kayan zafi.
But not in the heat.	Amma ba cikin zafi ba.
I can only imagine what he was thinking.	Zan iya tunanin me yake tunani.
But mine too.	Amma nawa kuma.
It will.	Zai yi.
It looks good on me.	Yayi min kyau.
We were surprised.	An ba mu mamaki.
He gets nothing.	Ba ya samun komai.
She knew she had to tell him everything.	Ta san ya kamata ta gaya masa komai.
I wrote most of the program.	Na rubuta mafi yawan shirin.
They can sleep well at night.	Suna iya yin barci da kyau da dare.
She wants me to be happy.	Tana so in yi farin ciki.
The whole day passed.	Duk ranar ta wuce.
All of this will leave you right where you are.	Duk wannan zai bar ku daidai inda kuka kasance.
It's very amazing.	Yana da matukar ban mamaki.
Nothing really.	Babu komai a gaskiya.
I worked for him for two years.	Na yi masa aiki tsawon shekaru biyu.
He stopped running.	Ya daina gudu.
Clever too.	Mai hankali kuma.
So write this down.	Don haka rubuta wannan a cikin ciki.
We were not surprised.	Ba mu yi mamaki ba.
You get that right away.	Kuna samun hakan nan take.
They keep walking.	Suna ci gaba da tafiya.
They bring him home.	Suka kawo shi gida.
This is definitely not true.	Wannan ko shakka babu gaskiya ne.
They know where the best time to do it.	Sun san inda lokaci mafi kyau ya kamata a yi.
Use most of the time.	Yi amfani da mafi yawan lokacin.
He must have failed miserably.	Lallai ya kasa kasa.
He can drink.	Zai iya sha.
So everything he shows is here to check.	Don haka duk abin da ya nuna yana nan a duba.
This is an interesting name.	Wannan suna ne mai ban sha'awa.
That person will not apply.	Wannan mutumin ba zai yi amfani ba.
Look ahead.	Duba gaba.
I do not need this.	Ba na bukatar wannan.
I can tell you that very well right now.	Zan iya gaya muku haka sosai a yanzu.
I agree now that he feels, nothing but this.	Na yarda yanzu haka yake ji, ba komai sai wannan.
That will never happen today.	Wannan ba zai taba faruwa ba a yau.
The rain was almost amazing.	Ruwan sama ya kusa kama su da mamaki.
Leave no doubt.	Bar babu shakka.
She went ahead.	Ta yi gaba.
It's there.	Yana can.
There needs to be only one thing.	Bukatar zama abu daya ne kawai.
But it is not.	Amma ba haka ba ne.
The first two things are true.	Waɗannan abubuwa biyu na farko gaskiya ne.
It is a difficult place.	Wuri ne mai wahala.
Either way.	Duk hanyar.
I can’t think of that as a good thing.	Ba zan iya tunanin hakan abu ne mai kyau ba.
I didn’t say we would.	Ban ce za mu yi ba.
I never thought of that.	Ban taba tunanin hakan ba.
I have never been around them and I was not happy.	Ban taba zama a kusa da su ba kuma ban yi farin ciki ba.
Maybe he was running.	Watakila yana gudu ne.
You just have to wait for them to get up.	Dole ne kawai ku jira su tashi.
No man can.	Ba mutumin da zai iya.
Maybe if you talk a little.	Wataƙila idan kun yi magana kaɗan.
Are you with us?	Kuna tare da mu?.
I have some money saved.	Ina da wasu kuɗi da aka ajiye.
I can't have it.	Ba zan iya da ita ba.
that.	wanda.
I will not miss anything.	Ba zan rasa komai ba.
They are very good all the time.	Suna da kyau sosai kowane lokaci.
It happened to everyone.	Ya faru da kowa.
I do that a lot.	Ina yin hakan da yawa.
Any chance tonight.	Duk wata dama ta daren yau.
People are protecting hearing.	Mutane suna kare ji.
No one can get better than me, he said.	Ba wanda zai iya samun mafi kyawun ni, in ji shi.
Much we know for sure.	Da yawa mun sani tabbas.
She touched him.	Ta taba shi.
It works in you.	Yana yin aiki a cikin ku.
You will, of course.	Za ku, tabbas.
It's not good to be sick, she said.	Ba abin farin ciki ba ne rashin lafiya, in ji ta.
Just call it as you see it.	Kawai kira shi kamar yadda kuke gani.
They got married a few years later.	Sun yi aure bayan ƴan shekaru.
I do not know where he is.	Ban san inda yake ba.
Some do not understand.	Wasu ba su fahimci hakan ba.
But no more.	Amma babu kuma.
Everything is finished.	An gama komai.
Money was made quickly.	An sami kudi cikin sauri.
Of course, they will not return successful.	Tabbas, ba za su dawo da nasara ba.
Why is that?	Me ya kai shi haka.
Time goes by slowly when you feel really good about yourself.	Lokaci yana tafiya a hankali lokacin da kuke jin daɗin kanku sosai.
So they had a hard time.	Sai suka yi wuya.
Stop because you know that.	Ka daina don ka san haka ne.
She should not see us here.	Kada ta ga muna nan.
They change the way you think.	Suna canza yadda kuke tunani.
No children playing outside.	Babu yara da suka yi wasa a waje.
We agree with that.	Mun yarda da hakan.
That was the game they won.	Wasan da suka yi nasara kenan.
She tried several times but failed to make any progress.	Ta gwada sau da yawa amma ta kasa samun wani ci gaba.
You will see it happen.	Za ku ga yana faruwa.
I think they did, you know.	Ina tsammanin sun yi, ka sani.
It may show you a little, maybe.	Zai iya nuna maka kadan, watakila.
I don't get anything.	Ba na samun komai.
You don't go out there and stand around.	Ba ka fita can ka tsaya a kusa ba.
It's a pleasure to have.	Abu ne mai daɗi don samun.
I have tried to cry in the past.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin kuka a baya.
Maybe you should be careful, too.	Wataƙila ya kamata ku yi hankali, ma.
So no thought will happen.	Don haka babu wani tunani da zai faru.
What do you think?	Me kuke tunani?
Eat dinner together.	Ku ci abincin dare tare.
She sells handmade food.	Ta sayar da kayan abinci na hannu.
It will help in the game.	Zai taimaka a wasan.
I hope you know that.	Ina fatan kun san haka.
We really like this place, and we recommend going.	Muna matukar son wannan wurin, kuma muna ba da shawarar zuwa.
Everything can be wrong.	Duk abin zai iya zama kuskure.
If so, that's fine.	Idan haka ne, yana da kyau.
No one knows where you are.	Babu wanda ya san inda kuke.
I will not add that.	Ba zan kara cewa ba.
We are always happy to hear from you.	Kullum muna farin cikin jin ta bakin ku.
That he has no one.	Cewa ba shi da kowa.
We moved on.	Muka yi gaba.
Whatever it is, it will be.	Abin da zai kasance, zai kasance.
It's a boat.	Jirgin ruwan ne.
Time is of the essence.	Lokaci abu ne mai wuya.
You can decide for yourself on this future.	Kuna iya yanke shawarar kanku akan wannan gaba.
He never touched it.	Bai taba taba shi ba.
If you think.	Idan kuna tunani .
And they keep growing, every year.	Kuma suna ci gaba da girma, kowace shekara.
I have no money anyway.	Ba ni da kuɗi ko yaya.
They do not belong to the same world.	Ba su kasance na duniya ɗaya ba.
It would not be so if I did not give them.	Ba zai zama haka ba in ba su ba.
I heard a lot, very quickly.	Na ji da yawa, da sauri.
But it is still not true.	Amma har yanzu ba gaskiya bane.
In reality, however, it is often not so.	A gaskiya, duk da haka, sau da yawa ba haka ba ne.
And before the game was over.	Kuma kafin wasan ya kasance.
But don’t tell me what to eat.	Amma kar ka gaya mani abin da zan ci.
Let me fix that.	Bari in gyara hakan.
If we can get them.	Idan za mu iya samun su.
I think they like me.	Ina tsammanin suna so na.
You can not go anywhere.	Ba za ku iya zuwa wani wuri ba.
I don't know anyone, he never came, he just went.	Ban san kowa ba, bai taɓa zuwa ba, kawai ya tafi.
Do the same.	Haka kare yayi.
Each user function has a name.   	Kowane aikin mai amfani yana da suna.   
He ate his lunch at home.	Ya ci abincin rana na gida.
They immediately came to me.	Nan take suka zo min.
Of course it can work.	Tabbas zai iya aiki.
I asked her to give me a job.	Na nemi ta ba ni aiki.
It does not get very easy.	Ba ya samun sauƙi sosai.
It's very difficult.	Dan wuya sosai.
It comes down to two things at this point.	Ya zo ga abubuwa biyu a wannan lokacin.
He hurried out the door.	Ya fita da sauri ta kofar.
Like it or not.	Kuna son shi ko ku ƙi shi.
It was done.	An yi shi.
The problem is, you don't.	Matsalar ita ce, ba ku.
A way to get you to do whatever he wants you to do.	Hanyar da za ta iya sa ku yi duk abin da yake so ku yi.
I can not wait.	Ba zan iya jira ba.
I use it only for good.	Ina amfani da shi kawai don kyau.
This is more than we can handle.	Wannan ya wuce abin da za mu iya yi.
It will not be the last.	Ba zai zama na ƙarshe ba.
I am thinking of traveling.	Ina tunanin yin tafiya.
There, we will prepare you.	A can, za mu shirya ku.
They are talking about the truth.	Suna magana ne akan gaskiya.
That happened a lot at the time.	Hakan ya faru da yawa a lokacin.
There he knew him very well.	A can ya san shi sosai.
This is a call.	Wannan kira ne.
This is not much.	Wannan ba shi da yawa.
Yet they could not do anything.	Duk da haka ba za su iya yin wani abu ba.
And the whole world can see it if they want to.	Kuma duk duniya za su iya gani idan suna so.
You want to reject that.	Kuna so ku ƙi hakan.
He stood by me.	Ya tsaya tare da ni.
It's just beautiful.	Yana da kyau kawai.
We want to be ourselves.	Muna son zama mu.
I knew that would never be enough.	Na san hakan ba zai taba isa ba.
I know what it will be.	Na san abin da zai kasance.
This too failed.	Wannan ma bai yi nasara ba.
This is not a good job.	Wannan ba aiki mai kyau bane.
The rest is mine.	Sauran nawa ne.
I let him do it.	Na bar shi yayi.
I do not care what you think.	Ban damu da me kuke tunani ba.
I am happy with that.	Na yi farin ciki da wannan.
After heavy rain, the water rose.	Bayan ruwan sama mai yawa, ruwan ya tashi.
They were never heard from again.	Ba a sake jin su ba.
Nothing for them.	Babu wani abu gare su.
I will not take it.	Ba zan dauka ba.
I get it from inside.	Ina samun shi daga ciki.
Please man.	Don Allah mutum.
It requires a lot more effort.	Yana buƙatar ƙarin ƙoƙari sosai.
You want something to be me.	Kuna son wani abu ya zama ni.
And maybe the world.	Kuma watakila duniya.
But we never talked about food.	Amma ba mu taɓa magana game da abinci ba.
We need to play well.	Muna bukatar mu yi wasa da kyau.
I don’t feel anything like them.	Ba na jin komai kamar su.
But she will not go.	Amma ba za ta je ba.
What a wonderful place!	Abin da ban mamaki wuri!
The world is full of surprises.	Duniya ta cika da mamaki.
Someone is sick.	Wani ba shi da lafiya.
I have to find a new job.	Dole ne in sami sabon aiki.
But nothing worked.	Amma babu abin da ya yi aiki.
I have so many things to do.	Ina da abubuwa da yawa da zan yi.
She should be able to live well.	Ya kamata ta kasance tana rayuwa sosai.
But the work never left the ground.	Amma aikin bai taba tashi daga kasa ba.
We are not alone.	Ba mu kadai ba.
Let's talk, let's make it happen.	Mu yi magana, mu sa abin ya faru.
I really do.	Ina yi da gaske.
So be it.	Haka ya kasance.
I was so scared.	Na ji tsoro sosai.
I can't see.	Ba zan iya gani ba.
I have a chance to buy.	Ina da damar saya.
She never did that.	Ba ta taba yin haka ba.
I finished second.	Na gama na biyu.
Okay, for a while.	Ya yi, na ɗan lokaci.
He came and married her.	Ya zo ya aure ta.
I had to work part-time though.	Dole ne in yi aiki na ɗan lokaci duk da haka.
People are still talking about it now.	Har yanzu mutane suna magana game da hakan a yanzu.
At first we thought nothing of it.	Da farko ba mu yi tunanin komai ba.
They can't remember anything.	Ba su iya tuna komai.
You can win or lose.	Kuna iya yin nasara ko ku yi rashin nasara.
You will know the way.	Za ku san hanyar.
A week later there was another.	Bayan mako akwai wani.
And the whole world is not as it seems.	Kuma duk duniya ba kamar yadda ake gani ba.
They live in it.	Suna zaune a ciki.
There is nothing we can do at this time.	Ba abin da za mu iya yi a wannan lokacin.
I went out there.	Na fita da can.
I'm glad none of you were injured.	Na ji dadi babu daya daga cikin ku da ya ji rauni.
You need two simple things.	Kuna buƙatar abubuwa biyu masu sauƙi.
They work for him and talk to him.	Suna yi masa aiki suna magana da shi.
This will definitely increase her interest.	Wannan ba shakka yana ƙara mata sha'awa.
I'm not sure if it works.	Ban tabbata ko yana aiki ba.
Maybe you don't know that.	Wataƙila ba ku san hakan ba.
We will not be afraid.	Ba za mu ji tsoro ba.
All of this makes you who you are today.	Duk wannan ya sanya ku wanda kuke a yau.
However, it may be necessary to just get involved with it.	Duk da haka, yana iya zama dole ne kawai ya shiga tare da shi.
More productivity, more money.	Yawan aiki, ƙarin kuɗi.
It was late at night.	Sai dare yayi.
We assumed that this was a mistake.	Mun ɗauka cewa wannan kuskure ne.
Come on, there's dinner.	Zo, akwai abincin dare.
But, yesterday you started missing it.	Amma, a jiya ka fara rasa shi.
Where does the water go when it rains?	Ina ruwan ya tafi idan aka yi ruwan sama?
They don’t look like anything.	Ba su yi kama da komai ba.
Also a lot of things haven’t changed.	Haka kuma wani abu da yawa bai canza ba.
Maybe it will suffice.	Wataƙila zai isa.
Then he came in.	Sai ya zo a .
He will do anything.	Zai yi komai.
But we started to worry about it.	Amma mun fara damu da shi.
In fact, we need something in general.	A gaskiya ma, muna buƙatar wani abu na gaba ɗaya.
One is similar to the next.	Daya yayi kama da na gaba.
The train had to return.	Dole jirgin ya koma.
This is not going to go away.	Wannan ba zai tafi ba.
It's really something.	Yana da gaske wani abu.
They are more common in children.	Sun fi yawa a cikin yara.
This is correct.	Wannan daidai ne.
, they accepted it.	, suka yarda da shi.
Who is new.	Wanene sabon.
Finding them, however, has been difficult.	Samun su, duk da haka, ya kasance da wahala.
I was really good at it.	Na kasance da shi sosai.
Less than grade.	Kasa da sa.
He is worried.	Ya damu.
I didn't do it again, I didn't plan to do it again.	Ban sake yin ta ba, ba a yi shirin sake yin ta ba.
They run faster than they can run.	Suna gudu fiye da yadda suke iya gudu.
We can't stay here.	Ba za mu iya zama a nan ba.
He wanted to come back but they gave it to me anyway.	Ya so ya dawo amma sun ba ni duk da haka.
Or it can't be found.	Ko kuma ba za a iya samu ba.
And they are fast, too.	Kuma suna da sauri, ma.
Do what you want.	Yi abin da kuke so.
Every day after work.	Kowace rana bayan aiki.
You’re wasting your time, though.	Kuna bata lokacin ku, ko da yake.
We removed everything necessary.	Mun cire duk abin da ya zama dole.
He needed to be.	Ya bukata ya kasance.
She is intelligent.	Tana da hankali.
To be done.	Da za a yi.
But now we are not ready for that.	Amma yanzu ba mu shirya don haka ba.
But who needs it.	Amma wa yake bukata.
He hit her on the head.	Ya buga mata kai.
I worked fast.	Na yi aiki da sauri.
Reading is work.	Karatu aiki ne.
She was like them.	Ta kasance kamar su.
You need to leave.	Kuna buƙatar barin.
Maybe he was in the house.	Wataƙila ya kasance a gidan.
We love you.	Muna son ku.
Now it’s hot to do both.	Yanzu yana da zafi yin duka biyu.
I could have found it years ago.	Zan iya samun shi shekaru da suka wuce.
Tell me what you see or what you do not see.	Faɗa mini abin da kuke gani ko abin da ba ku gani.
Of course not.	Tabbas bai tabbata ba.
So, honestly.	Don haka, gaskiya.
I didn’t even bother with the front door.	Ban ma damu da kofar gida ba.
No one felt right.	Babu wanda ya ji daidai.
We are still here.	Har yanzu muna nan.
But she loves it there.	Amma tana son shi a can.
I think that's enough.	Ina ganin ya isa haka.
I want to play	Ina so in yi wasa
She could not walk or talk.	Ta kasa tafiya ko magana.
In this way.	Ta wannan hanya.
I haven't seen it happen yet.	Ban ga abin ya faru ba tukuna.
It will happen soon.	Zai faru da sauri.
But this time, she left.	Amma wannan lokaci guda, ta bar shi.
Mostly, though, she walks.	Mafi yawa, ko da yake, tana tafiya.
We have a lot of time.	Muna da lokaci mai yawa.
Some, it is said.	Wasu, ana cewa,.
We tried everything we could think of.	Mun gwada duk abin da za mu iya tunani.
Some people are standing in the back of the room.	Wasu mutane ne suka tsaya a bayan dakin.
In the end you get everything you want.	A ƙarshe kuna samun duk abin da kuke so.
You took an easy job because it was healthy.	Kun ɗauki aiki mai sauƙi saboda yana da lafiya.
They are so beautiful.	Sun yi kyau sosai.
She got something.	Ta sami wani abu.
It is not real life.	Ba rayuwa ta gaske ba ce.
But you are still second.	Amma har yanzu kuna na biyu.
And that worked.	Kuma hakan yayi aiki.
He will be happy.	Zai yi farin ciki.
Or, well, they should be.	Ko, da kyau, ya kamata su kasance.
I think you know you are better than that.	Na dauka ka san ka fi haka.
That can happen, he realized.	Hakan na iya faruwa, ya gane.
She could not change it.	Ta kasa canza shi.
We will send it to you immediately.	Za mu aika muku da shi nan take.
Like everything about this place.	Kamar komai game da wannan wuri.
He would never let her go.	Ba zai taba bari ta tafi ba.
You can only live.	Za ku iya rayuwa kawai.
He fell into the room.	Ya fad'a cikin d'akin.
Before she started working she tidied up the room.	Kafin ta fara aiki ta gyara dakin.
Be careful with that.	Yi hankali da wannan.
I took something.	Na dauki wani abu.
Everything is cut.	Duk abin da aka yanke.
But if it feels right, and it’s good, it works.	Amma idan yana jin daidai, kuma yana da kyau, yana aiki.
I was surprised by the uneasiness of the food.	Na yi mamakin rashin jin daɗin abincin.
She was arrested twice.	An kama ta sau biyu.
You will not let it be.	Ba za ku bari ya kasance ba.
However, it is also the fastest way.	Duk da haka, shi ne kuma mafi sauri hanya.
You will never do it.	Ba za ku taɓa yin sa ba.
It is very healthy.	Yana da lafiya sosai.
It would not be foolish for us to do as we please.	Ba zai zama rashin hankali mu yi yadda muka ga dama ba.
Just read the article.	Kawai karanta labarin.
Or whatever it was.	Ko wani abu ya kasance.
Eventually something closed.	A ƙarshe wani abu ya rufe.
The only one that suits me.	Wanda ya dace da ni kawai.
And boy is it mine.	Kuma yaro shi nawa ne.
There is no word that can correct that.	Babu wata magana da za ta iya gyara hakan.
She said.	Ta ce.
It is, effectively, infallible.	Yana da, yadda ya kamata, rashin kuskure.
I think they can fix it really, easily.	Ina tsammanin za su iya gyara shi da gaske, da sauƙi.
It doesn't seem that way.	Kamar ba wuya haka ba.
Good movie but not great.	Fim mai kyau amma ba mai girma ba.
I do the same.	Ni ma haka nake yi.
If we stop fighting they will.	Idan muka daina fada za su yi.
I will be too.	Ni ma zan kasance.
She may have been arrested.	Wataƙila an kama ta.
I think it doesn't matter who or why.	Ina tsammanin ba komai ko wanene ko me yasa.
You do not have to hear anything.	Ba lallai ne ku ji komai ba.
No, it's something.	A'a, wani abu ne.
It's nothing.	Ba komai bane.
You did nothing.	Ba ku yi komai ba.
She brought you here.	Ta kawo ka nan.
My employer gave me more prominence.	Mai aiki na ya ba ni ƙarin girma.
It's delicious, too, once.	Yana da dadi, kuma, sau ɗaya.
I know it hurts.	Na san ya yi zafi.
Rejoice, do well, be yourself !.	Yi farin ciki, yi kyau, zama kanku!.
It is very cold at night.	Dare yayi sanyi sosai.
That too is good.	Hakan ma yayi kyau.
Or when we are scared.	Ko kuma lokacin da muke jin tsoro.
This book caught my attention.	Littafin nan ya kama ni.
Of course, we have it all too.	Lallai, muna da duka kuma.
It allows us to be.	Yana ba mu damar zama.
But you can not.	Amma ba za ku iya ba.
That's enough.	Ya isa haka.
Hope you enjoy it !.	Da fatan za ku ji daɗi!.
I could not help myself.	Na kasa taimakon kaina.
And she wept.	Sai ta yi kuka.
Right, that has never happened before.	Dama, kamar haka ya taɓa faruwa.
If they are, we can find out where we are.	Idan sun kasance, za mu iya gano inda muke.
Do not pass.	Kada ku wuce.
Watching them really does.	Kallon su yayi da gaske.
I need to go.	Ina bukata in tafi.
I want to go with them.	Ina so in tafi tare da su.
He ate and drank with the rest, talking all together	Ya ci ya sha tare da sauran, yana magana duka
You are hard to get caught.	Kuna da wuya a kama ku.
So they went home.	Sai da suka tafi gida.
He sat on the floor like a sleeper.	Ya zauna a kasa ya yi kamar mai barci.
This is definitely not a joke.	Wannan ba shakka ba wasa ba ne.
Of course we will tell everyone that you are with me.	Tabbas za mu gaya wa kowa cewa kuna tare da ni.
It takes effort.	Yana buƙatar ƙoƙari.
So do your best.	Don haka yi mafi kyawun su.
A lot of things were in play.	Abubuwa da yawa sun kasance cikin wasa.
You started all this.	Kun fara duk wannan.
And that's what we were there for.	Kuma abin da muka kasance a wurin ke nan.
This is your problem.	Wannan ita ce matsalar ku.
She loves this ship.	Ta son wannan jirgin.
I like everything about it.	Ina son komai game da shi.
So nothing else.	Don haka babu wani abu kuma.
We went to school together.	Tare muka yi makaranta.
Everything that is true is true of the present.	Duk abin da yake gaskiya gaskiya ne na yanzu.
Try to go to bed early tonight.	Yi ƙoƙarin yin barci da wuri a daren yau.
There must be others.	Dole ne a sami wasu.
Suddenly no one could tell her what she did not know.	Nan da nan ba wanda ya iya gaya mata abin da ba ta sani ba.
I understand why though.	Na fahimci dalilin da ya sa ko da yake.
I looked at the door.	Na kalli kofar.
You have to stay here with us.	Dole ku zauna a nan tare da mu.
Wait, this is not right.	Jira, wannan ba daidai ba ne.
Or should.	Ko ya kamata.
He brought two people.	Ya kawo mutum biyu.
The failure was painful.	Rashin nasara ya yi zafi.
We will take care of it.	Za mu kula da shi.
So, these are really good.	Don haka, waɗannan suna da kyau sosai.
Hope you are not missing out.	Da fatan ba a rasa ba.
They are both internal and external.	Abubuwa ne na ciki da na ban mamaki.
Do not remove it from me.	Kar ka cire min shi.
Children have nothing, nothing.	Yara ba su da komai, babu komai.
Apparently, he was asleep, and before that he had drunk.	Babu shakka, yana barci, kuma kafin nan ya sha sha.
However, this was not done.	Duk da haka, ba a yi hakan ba.
He loves fish.	Yana son kifi.
Some have succeeded.	Wasu sun sami nasara.
This is not like any other place.	Wannan ba kamar kowane wuri bane.
Sure it went all or nothing.	Ya tabbata ya tafi duka ko ba komai.
You know this is true.	Kun san wannan gaskiya ne.
The process however is the same.	Hanyar duk da haka gaba ɗaya ce.
It works really well.	Yana aiki sosai.
When everyone is safe.	Lokacin da kowa ke zaune lafiya.
I miss what it could be.	Na rasa me zai iya zama.
He also has no money.	Shi ma bashi da kudi.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
They are easy and quick to make.	Suna da sauƙi da sauri don yin.
And with her when he left.	Kuma tare da ita idan ya tafi.
This was later proved false.	Daga baya aka tabbatar da hakan karya ne.
You know the name.	Kun san sunan.
Tell him to stop	Ka gaya masa ya daina
Just remember that next time.	Kawai tuna cewa a karo na gaba.
No one is running to them now.	Babu wanda ya gudu zuwa gare su yanzu.
I think it's really good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau sosai.
After that, they can do whatever they want.	Bayan haka, za su iya yin abin da suke so.
He went on to say no.	Ya ci gaba zuwa a'a.
You've changed a bit.	Kun ɗan canza.
She can.	Ta iya.
They know that they will have food here.	Sun san cewa za su sami abinci a nan.
I would like this room	Ina son wannan dakin
And we don't know what to do with it.	Kuma ba mu san me za mu yi da hakan ba.
Leave it for a day.	Bar shi kwana daya.
For somehow it was good.	Don ko ta yaya ya yi kyau.
This is our second look.	Wannan shi ne mu biyu duba.
This has been working fine.	Wannan ya kasance yana aiki lafiya.
No one helped him with the school work.	Babu wanda ya taimaka masa da aikin makaranta.
It is time to stop doing this to you.	Lokaci ya yi da za mu daina yi muku haka.
I want to see both.	Ina so in ga duka.
I'm planning.	Ina shirin.
Seeing people.	Ganin mutane.
We do not need to get involved in this.	Ba mu buƙatar shiga cikin wannan.
I decided to quit school.	Na yanke shawarar daina karatu.
He was given a job he was not interested in.	An ba shi aikin da ba shi da sha'awa.
He worries that you will kill him or arrest him.	Ya damu cewa za ku kashe shi ko ku kama shi.
This will pass.	Wannan zai wuce.
He did not see the things he wanted to see.	Bai ga abubuwan da yake son gani ba.
I live a very happy life.	Ina rayuwa cikin farin ciki sosai.
It's lunch time.	Lokacin abincin rana ne.
We do not know what will happen.	Ba za mu iya sanin abin da zai faru ba.
Kind of where others are.	Irin inda wasu suke.
I have to help.	Dole ne in taimaka.
Fear of being alone.	Tsoron zama kadai.
I need you to sign the name.	Ina bukata ku sanya hannu kan suna.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
Easy to make.	Sauƙi don yin.
Do not waste food!	Kar a bata abinci!
I didn't get a good night's sleep last night.	Ban yi barci mai kyau ba a daren jiya.
It's sad but true.	Abin bakin ciki ne amma gaskiya.
He could not see.	Ya kasa gani.
But it was not done.	Amma ba a yi ba.
Actually, this is not true.	A gaskiya, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
The day after tomorrow is over.	Kwana bayan rana ta wuce.
But it really happened.	Amma da gaske haka abin ya faru.
I hope that is not me.	Ina fata cewa ba ni ba.
This is good.	Wannan yana da kyau.
She doesn't have to worry.	Ba dole ta damu ba.
He waited until they had decided what to do next.	Ya jira lokacin da suke yanke shawarar abin da za su yi a gaba.
It's still good.	Har yanzu yana da kyau.
We entered.	Muka shiga.
I'm sorry.	Ina cewa a yi hakuri.
He remembered where he was.	Ya tuna inda yake.
I know nothing.	Ban san komai ba.
But the door is open.	Amma kofar a bude take.
I didn't say anything to anyone.	Ban ce wa kowa komai ba.
Better to buy two.	Gara saya biyu.
She would not let me talk to him.	Ba za ta bar ni in yi masa magana ba.
For me it was.	A gare ni ya kasance.
One thing keep going.	Wani abu daya ci gaba da shi.
I need to hear it.	Ina bukata in ji shi.
You are as fast as they are.	Kuna da sauri kamar yadda suke.
Please remove them from view.	Da fatan za a cire su daga gani.
They did it again this year.	Sun sake yin hakan a bana.
Maybe we should understand that.	Wataƙila ya kamata mu gane hakan.
But to no avail.	Amma hakan bai yi wani amfani ba.
The day is gone.	Ranar ta tafi.
It looks good.	Da alama yana da kyau.
There is nothing that can be done about it.	Ba abin da za a iya yi in ba shi ba.
I want to be something.	Ina so in zama wani abu.
Now nothing is as it should be.	Yanzu babu abin da ya kasance kamar yadda ya kamata.
The teacher is completely unpopular.	Gaba daya ba a son malamin.
He was just.	Ya kasance kawai.
But things changed for the better.	Amma abin ya koma komai.
Everyone knows what to do.	Kowa ya san abin yi.
This is too much.	Wannan ya yi yawa.
They are all gone!	Duk sun tafi!
He lost his temper and could not speak.	Ya rasa fada ya kasa magana.
This is well explained.	Wannan an bayyana shi da kyau.
Police were called to arrest him.	An kira ‘yan sanda don kama shi.
I suffered from it.	Na sha wahala da shi.
And don’t think it will be easy.	Kuma kada ku yi tsammanin zai kasance da sauƙi.
But there you have it.	Amma akwai kuna da shi.
Now he’s got even more.	Yanzu ya samu ma fiye da haka.
Almost everyone who travels here loves it.	Kusan duk wanda ya yi tafiya a nan yana son shi.
Maybe it's not very good.	Wataƙila ba shi da kyau sosai.
Don’t expect too much.	Kada ku yi tsammanin da yawa.
They are not in debt.	Ba bashi ba.
Over the years, they have all grown tremendously.	Tsawon shekaru, duk sun yi girma sosai.
We were early.	Mun kasance da wuri.
I do not know how to get it.	Ban san yadda zan samu ba.
Open the door and enter.	Bude kofar da shiga.
Be careful when swimming here.	Yi hankali lokacin yin iyo a nan.
There is nothing to do.	Babu wani abu da za a yi.
I do not know how to change.	Ban san yadda zan canza ba.
This is hard on him.	Wannan yana da wuya a kansa.
I think it's right.	Ina ganin yayi daidai.
Not many people came out.	Ba mutane da yawa suka fito ba.
Although it does not prove to be a problem.	Ko da yake bai tabbatar da zama matsala ba.
There is no truth and it seems true.	Babu gaskiya da alama gaskiya.
Some of us have.	Wasu daga cikin mu suna da.
This thing surprised me.	Wannan abu ya bani mamaki.
So it is true that they were defeated.	Don haka gaskiya ne sun ci su.
Please be shown how.	Da fatan za a nuna yadda.
But it is still amazing.	Amma har yanzu yana da ban mamaki.
Change it if you want.	Canza shi idan kuna so.
It was a wonderful feeling.	Wani irin ji ne mai ban mamaki.
We ate delicious food.	Mun ci abinci mai daɗi.
But at the end of the day it is the man.	Amma a karshen ranar shi ne mutumin.
This is as certain as it can be.	Wannan yana da tabbas kamar yadda tabbas zai iya zama.
We are not alone.	Ba mu kawai.
I want to make sure she understands.	Ina so in tabbatar ta gane.
Can anyone help please ???.	Shin wani zai iya taimaka don Allah???.
But it seems to be true.	Amma da alama gaskiya ne.
He read well.	Yayi karatu mai kyau.
So far he is doing very well.	Ya zuwa yanzu yana yin kyau sosai.
I do not want to see them close to each other.	Ba na son ganin su kusa da juna.
He would never do it.	Ba zai taba yi ba.
All of these things are not true.	Duk waɗannan abubuwan ba gaskiya bane.
Do not eat too much.	Kada ku ci da yawa.
The mouth is cold as usual.	Bakin ya yi sanyi ba kamar yadda aka saba ba.
You will know when you have found the right thing.	Za ku san lokacin da kuka sami abin da ya dace.
It was something she had really thought about.	Wani abu ne ta yi tunani sosai a kai.
They feel cold, just like the rest of me.	Suna jin sanyi, kamar sauran ni.
She does not know if this is true or not.	Ba ta sani ba ko hakan gaskiya ne ko a'a.
It was indeed a wonderful time.	Da gaske lokaci ne mai ban mamaki.
But it is not good.	Amma ba shi da kyau.
With respect to.	Game da.
We cannot leave it that way.	Ba za mu iya barin shi haka ba.
When they get here, they run away.	Idan suka fito nan sai su gudu.
Not now.	Ba yanzu ba.
I do not agree with anything.	Ban yarda da komai ba.
I suggest that we go through it.	Ina ba da shawarar cewa mu wuce ta.
Don’t worry if you miss us.	Kada ku damu idan kun rasa mu.
You are	Kun kasance
He brought them out.	Ya fito da su waje.
I like how hard it is.	Ina son yadda yake da wuya.
Come on.	Ku zo.
But no one did.	Amma babu wanda ya yi.
She really wanted to go.	Lallai ta so ya tafi.
He could not leave twice.	Bai iya barin sau biyu ba.
But they are not here.	Amma ba su nan.
If you want to go, you must go.	Idan kana son tafiya, dole ne ka tafi.
No one will fix it.	Babu wanda zai gyara shi.
Another place.	Wani wuri kuma.
So they got married.	Haka suka yi aure.
Maybe they should.	Wataƙila ya kamata su.
Just always through everything there.	Kawai koyaushe ta hanyar duk abin da ke can.
There was no real thought in my head.	Babu ainihin tunani a cikin kaina.
I know, life is hard for you.	Na sani, rayuwa ta yi muku wuya.
Thoughts of thought.	Tunani na tunani.
Women should be allowed to wear this.	Ya kamata a bar mata su sanya wannan.
The problem is all this time.	Matsalar duk wannan lokaci ne.
It's very amazing.	Yana da matukar ban mamaki.
This is a home away from home.	Wannan wurin gida ne.
She has lived at home with him ever since the day she was bought.	Ta zauna a gida da shi tun daga ranar da aka saya.
She is back.	Ta dawo.
I do nothing and you do not give.	Ba na yin komai kuma ku ma ba ku.
You need this.	Kuna buƙatar wannan.
That should be fun.	Wannan ya kamata ya zama abin jin daɗi.
We immediately became accustomed to something new.	Nan da nan muka saba da wani sabon abu.
She saw things that were not there.	Ta ga abubuwan da ba su nan.
No game.	Babu wasa.
I couldn’t take myself at all after that.	Ban iya ɗaukar kaina ko kaɗan bayan haka.
I don't care how long it took.	Ban damu da tsawon lokacin da aka dauka ba.
Now go back.	Yanzu koma baya.
So watch what you have to say!	Don haka kalli abin da kuke fada!
He is not dead.	Bai mutu ba.
This is a wonderful day.	Wannan rana ce mai ban mamaki.
Something strange was happening there.	Wani abu mai ban mamaki yana faruwa a wurin.
We enjoyed a delicious fish meal at night.	Mun ji daɗin cin abincin kifi mai daɗi a daren.
I am an athlete	Ni dan wasa ne
We are doing this work together.	Muna yin wannan aikin tare.
We met the right person at the right time.	Mun hadu da mutumin da ya dace a lokacin da ya dace.
This channel is published or lost.	Wannan tashar an buga ko rasa.
We really enjoyed it.	Mun ji daɗi sosai.
This is also true when you should know best.	Wannan ma gaskiya ne lokacin da ya kamata ku sani mafi kyau.
I was tired after a long time at this job.	Na gaji bayan tsawon lokaci a wannan aikin.
This takes most of the time.	Wannan yana ɗaukar mafi yawan lokaci.
To me, it worked well.	A gare ni, ta yi kyau.
But in the end, the truth prevailed.	Amma a ƙarshe, gaskiya ta yi nasara.
The decision may be final.	Shawarar na iya zama na ƙarshe.
It just has to happen.	Dole ne kawai ya faru.
A lot is good.	Da yawa yana da kyau.
All this food will be kept together.	Duk wannan abincin za a ci gaba ɗaya.
This was alone and back.	Wannan ya kasance shi kaɗai kuma baya.
I encountered a problem today.	Na hadu da matsala a yau.
It goes with everything.	Yana tafiya da komai.
Winter is here.	Lokacin sanyi yana nan.
No, it is not.	A'a, ba haka ba ne.
By doing this.	Ta hanyar yin wannan.
She's a little tired.	Ta dan gaji.
We have won, you guys.	Mun ci nasara, ku mutane.
When she left.	Lokacin da ta tafi.
But we will see how they will be if they try.	Amma za mu ga yadda za su kasance idan sun gwada.
A little late for school or not?	A dan makara makaranta ko ba haka ba?
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
Everything comes slowly.	Duk abin da ya zo a hankali.
Do you know where this is?	Kun san inda wannan yake?
Stay with them.	Ku zauna da su.
It's back inside.	An koma ciki.
I couldn’t live more than that.	Ba zan iya rayuwa fiye da haka ba.
We all have one.	Duk muna da daya.
You probably know him.	Wataƙila ka san shi.
I need to call some people.	Ina bukata in kira wasu mutane.
You must do it again.	Dole ne ku sake yin shi sau ɗaya.
I don't like it anymore.	Ba na son shi kuma.
Don’t worry too much there.	Kada in damu da yawa a can.
Let me assure you.	Bari in tabbatar muku.
Do not be afraid.	Kar a ji tsoro.
No need to.	Babu bukatar babu.
Thoughts seem to come out of nowhere.	Tunanin kamar ya fito daga babu.
But this is behind us.	Amma wannan yana bayan mu.
That's what we want them to do.	Abin da muke so su yi ke nan.
She loves it.	Tana son shi.
I can feel really good.	Ina iya ji sosai.
She lived.	Ta yi rayuwa.
He is thought to be dead.	Ana tsammanin ya mutu.
I prefer to drink coffee.	Na fi son in sha kofi.
It will last two more days.	Za ta kara kwana biyu.
This is a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne.
We do the work only to get the job done.	Muna yin aikin ne kawai don yin aikin.
Who is your favorite person in the world?	Wanene wanda kuka fi so a duniya?
But it was good for her.	Amma yayi mata kyau.
We don't have to go out later.	Ba sai mun fita daga baya ba.
This has long been known.	An dade da sanin wannan.
I want to know what.	Ina son sanin menene.
They gave him thought.	Suka ba shi tunani.
I still do a little to this day.	Har yanzu ina yin kadan har yau.
I have to be the best.	Dole ne in zama mafi kyau.
I think it's amazing.	Ina tsammanin yana da ban mamaki.
I want you to be around me to eat and drink together.	Ina so ku kusa da ni ku ci ku sha tare.
I was not there.	Ban kasance a wurin ba.
It seems to be working well.	Da alama yana aiki da kyau.
I want you to.	Ina so ku yi.
Not just kids.	Ba kawai yara ba.
I could not find a comfortable place.	Na kasa samun wuri mai dadi.
I feel good, of course.	Na ji dadi, tabbas.
Almost like sleep.	Kusan kamar barci.
We came out.	Muka fito.
Homework was easy.	Aikin gida ya kasance mai sauƙi.
She also became very ill.	Haka kuma ta yi rashin lafiya da yawa.
He cried all night.	Yayi kuka har dare.
That is a correct statement.	Wannan magana ce daidai.
The restaurant is nearby.	Gidan abinci yana kusa.
He did not know it.	Bai san shi ba.
I knew it was.	Na san cewa ya kasance.
This is definitely the best success of my career.	Wannan tabbas ita ce mafi kyawun nasara na aiki na.
Which they probably did.	Wanda watakila sun yi.
He did not think so, he ran away.	Bai yi tunani ba, ya gudu.
Never again found anything close to sleep.	Bata sake samun wani abu kusa da barci ba.
We have to get up and talk, we have to talk.	Dole ne mu tashi mu yi magana, mu yi magana.
It will not do well.	Ba zai yi kyau ba.
But you know, people are always saying you catch someone.	Amma ka sani, kullum mutane suna cewa ka kama wani.
But only if you want to.	Amma kawai idan kuna so.
No one tried it.	Babu wanda ya gwada.
However, he is more comfortable with himself.	Duk da haka, ya fi jin daɗin kansa.
He ate well, but said little.	Yana ci da kyau, amma ya ce kaɗan.
We met at a wedding.	Mun hadu a wani bikin aure.
But then he became willing to work with us.	Amma sai ya zama yana so ya yi aiki tare da mu.
You do not, you do not have time.	Ba ku, ba ku da lokaci.
The food is good here.	Abincin yana da kyau a nan.
I looked back.	Na kalli baya.
It is not yet time to find out.	Lokaci bai yi da za a gano ba.
It should be finished as soon as possible.	Yakamata a gama da wuri.
Not like you.	Ba kamar ku ba ne.
Couldn't find out where.	Ya kasa gano inda.
Maybe he can.	Wataƙila yana iya.
There is a good feeling of waiting.	Akwai kyakkyawan ji na jira.
However, it is still in its infancy.	Duk da haka, har yanzu ya fara.
He thought she was right.	Ya dauka ta yi gaskiya.
I have a train to catch.	Ina da jirgin kasa da zan kama.
One thing at a time.	Abu daya a lokaci guda.
This is a little bit.	Wannan kadan ne.
We love it here safe.	Muna son shi a nan lafiya.
I'll run one for you.	Zan gudu muku daya.
Of course the ceremony is over.	Tabbas an gama bikin.
It just seems to be enough.	Da alama ya isa haka kawai.
We want to eat !.	Muna son ci!.
I'm done waiting for both of you.	Na gama jiran ku biyu.
No, sorry he didn't know what kind of equipment.	A'a, yi hakuri bai san irin kayan aiki ba.
Either way it will be slow.	Ko ta yaya zai kasance a hankali.
It is almost not enough.	Bai kusan isa ba.
But.	Amma.
She seems to remember.	Da alama ta tuna.
I need to stop this.	Ina bukata in daina wannan.
The work is going well.	Aikin yana tafiya da kyau.
Who brought me the story of this game.	Wanda ya kawo ni labarin wannan wasan.
Come if you can.	Ku zo in za ku iya.
You do not need it.	Ba ku buƙatar shi.
So far, everything is working.	Ya zuwa yanzu, komai yana aiki.
Kids are watching the players now more than ever.	Yara suna kallon 'yan wasa yanzu fiye da kowane lokaci.
We will never lose sight of each other.	Ba za mu taɓa rasa sanin juna ba.
Equipment is made like a toy and many other things.	An yi kayan aiki kamar wasan wasa da abubuwa da yawa.
However, early too.	Duk da haka, da wuri ma.
She released him.	Ta sake shi.
Near school.	Kusa da makaranta.
I take it personally.	Ina ɗauka irin ta kaina.
Then he thought of something.	Sai ya yi tunanin wani abu.
I am very close.	Ina kusa sosai.
He wants them to come back.	Yana son su dawo.
Finding a job has not been easy.	Neman aiki bai kasance mai sauƙi ba.
Not even himself.	Ba ma kansa ba.
He will surely return.	Tabbas zai dawo.
You can have any name you want.	Kuna iya samun kowane suna da kuke so.
I love you so much.	Ina son ku sosai.
It may be new but try it.	Yana iya zama sabon abu amma gwada shi.
He cared for me unlike anyone else.	Ya kula da ni ba kamar kowa ba.
They need us now.	Suna bukatar mu yanzu.
I will not do it.	Ba zan yi ba.
And she told him.	Sai ta fada masa.
I have to go, you say.	Dole ne in tafi, ka ce.
You can have it sweet.	Kuna iya samun shi mai daɗi.
The story only goes from this moment.	Labarin yana tafiya ne kawai daga wannan lokacin.
As you are.	Kamar yadda kuke.
It is no longer filled.	Ba a k'ara cika ta ba.
Although nothing.	Ko da yake ba komai.
I grew up very well.	Na yi girma sosai.
She sat, not running.	Ta zauna, ba gudu ba.
Together we can do it !.	Tare za mu iya yi!.
You are very interested in me.	Kuna sha'awar ni sosai.
She will see that.	Zata ga haka.
We accept the need to be careful.	Mun yarda da bukatar yin hankali.
We will leave it now.	Za mu bar shi a yanzu.
Within a month.	A cikin wata daya.
That's what he said.	Haka ya ce.
She called again.	Ta sake kira.
We didn't see anything.	Ba mu ga komai ba.
But she did not know how to turn off the job.	Amma ba ta san yadda za ta kashe aikin ba.
Now it's easy.	Yanzu yana da sauƙi.
I have to protect her.	Dole na kare ta.
On this financial problem came.	A kan wannan matsalar kudi ta zo.
Or on rain.	Ko a kan ruwan sama.
The speed passed the first car.	Da gudu ya wuce motar farko.
He keeps running.	Yana ci gaba da gudu.
I'm glad I looked here.	Na yi farin ciki da na duba nan.
I will never do it.	Ba zan taba yi ba.
It was a difficult journey.	Tafiya ce mai wahala.
But then he asked me to look.	Amma sai ya ce in duba.
Or it could be.	Ko kuma yana iya zama.
But they are not the only ones.	Amma ba mutane ba ne kawai.
They are made.	An yi su.
I have never been there.	Ban taba tafiya a wurin ba.
It always worked.	Ya yi aiki ko da yaushe.
We do not know exactly why she went.	Ba mu san ainihin dalilin da ya sa ta tafi ba.
I thought of the house.	Na yi tunanin gidan.
He has no money on it.	Ba shi da kudi a kansa.
Next to it.	Kusa da shi.
Three times they refused.	Sau uku suka ƙi.
This is an amazing thing.	Wannan abu ne mai ban mamaki.
Without ever telling him.	Ba tare da ya taba gaya masa ba.
He did not know how to respond.	Bai san yadda zai amsa ba.
Or does he just not pay attention when you tell him something to do?	Ko ya ga ya saba.
They will act like him.	Za su yi kamar shi.
Did you know there.	Shin kun san akwai.
And how he knew it.	Da kuma yadda ya san shi.
All of these have been fixed.	Duk waɗannan an gyara su.
And maybe that is the problem ?.	Kuma watakila wannan yana cikin matsalar?.
What happened to you is true.	Abin da ya faru da ku gaskiya ne.
Or catch him lying.	Ko kama shi da karya.
No time to think, just answer.	Babu lokacin tunani, kawai amsa.
Decide what you want.	Yanke shawarar abin da kuke so.
It is, however, difficult to do many good things.	Yana da, duk da haka, yana da wuya a yi abubuwa da yawa da kyau.
But he never came.	Amma bai taba zuwa ba.
Sometimes we just walk.	Wani lokaci muna tafiya kawai.
You need.	Kuna bukata.
This worked very well for us.	Wannan yayi mana aiki sosai.
Boy did we make a mistake.	Yaro mun yi kuskure.
I hope you are right.	Ina fatan kun yi gaskiya.
But he went further.	Amma ya kara gaba.
Coffee is hot.	Kofi yana da zafi.
I myself will not pass.	Ni kaina ba zan wuce ba.
I do not understand.	Ban gane ba.
She had a good night.	Ta yi ta kwana masu dadi.
They may take some time before they appear.	Suna iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kafin su bayyana.
That should never happen again, everyone says.	Bai kamata hakan ya sake faruwa ba, kowa ya ce.
It 's enough right now.	Yana cikin isa yanzu.
It's so good.	Yana da kyau haka.
However, that has not happened yet.	Amma, hakan bai faru ba tukuna.
About them is water.	Game da su ne da ruwa.
From home.	Daga gida.
That ended the meeting.	Wannan ya kawo karshen taron.
Now that doesn't seem to be happening.	Yanzu da alama hakan ba zai faru ba.
I'd like to try it on	Ina so in gwada
You all get ready.	Duk ku shirya.
He wanted her.	Ya so ta.
But there can also be discomfort.	Amma kuma ana iya samun rashin jin daɗi.
This is too much for her.	Wannan yayi mata yawa.
No, she went back to the beach.	A'a, ta koma bakin ruwa.
They say.	Suna fada.
But we like it that way.	Amma muna son shi haka.
They have to go to school.	Dole ne su je makaranta.
These are good.	Waɗannan suna da kyau.
She has a lot of interest.	Tana da sha'awa da yawa.
It's good.	Yana da kyau.
He thinks like us.	Yana tunani kamar mu.
Inside, he knew he was wrong.	A ciki, ya san ba daidai ba ne.
Certainly not for the person.	Lallai ba ga mutumin ba.
You can name some.	Kuna iya suna wasu.
But, he is still self-employed.	Amma, har yanzu yana yin aikin kai.
If you come back tomorrow, you will be lost.	Idan ka dawo gobe, za a bata.
People love the real thing.	Mutane suna son ainihin abin.
You will learn and practice.	Za ku koyi da yin.
Please read it carefully.	Da fatan za a karanta a hankali.
No one would want to read it.	Ba wanda zai so ya karanta shi.
Tell me what you are doing today.	Faɗa mini abin da kuke yi yau.
He killed it though, of course.	Ya kashe shi ko da yake, ba shakka.
I should be very worried about you.	Ya kamata in damu da kai sosai.
After all, things are complicated.	Bayan haka, abubuwa suna da wuya.
But that is a lie.	Amma wannan karya ce.
The house is empty.	Gidan babu kowa.
I went like that.	Na tafi haka.
I refused to sit around.	Na ƙi zama a kusa.
They always hated him.	Koyaushe sun ƙi shi.
Our food is over.	Abincin mu ya kare.
It’s not the best, but it works.	Ba shine mafi kyau ba, amma yayi aiki.
I saw the world the way people do.	Na ga duniya yadda mutane suke yi.
They wanted to play with me.	Sun so su yi min wasa.
I wondered what was going on.	Na yi mamakin me ke faruwa.
He knew he didn't want to be alone.	Ya san cewa ba ya son zama shi kaɗai.
No one has ever seen a car here.	Babu wanda ya taba ganin mota a nan.
I saw that he loved her.	Na ga yana son ta.
This is the funniest yet.	Wannan shine mafi ban dariya tukuna.
Just stay safe.	Kawai zauna lafiya.
But there is no time.	Amma babu lokaci.
He said he would come there to help me.	Ya ce zai zo can ya taimake ni.
They come immediately.	Suna zuwa nan take.
That is what happens, in the end.	Wannan shine abin da ke faruwa, a ƙarshe.
I can't pay her.	Ba zan iya biya mata ba.
And now that is enough.	Kuma yanzu ya isa haka.
We are changing the way the world works.	Muna canza yadda duniya ke aiki.
It's game time.	Lokacin wasa ne.
I'm going there.	Ina zuwa can.
Not yet, not really.	Ba tukuna, ba sosai.
The work took longer than it appeared.	Aikin ya ɗauki fiye da yadda ya bayyana.
So, eating out is a chore.	Don haka, cin abinci a waje ya zama aiki.
And he never missed a day.	Kuma bai taba rasa rana daya ba.
Some of these things are difficult.	Wasu daga cikin abubuwan nan suna da wahala.
Fear in others.	Tsoro a cikin wasu.
I am not useful to you.	Ba ni da amfani gare ku.
Walk.	Tafiya.
Not what she enjoyed.	Ba abin da ta ji daɗi ba.
But some may like this.	Amma wasu na iya son wannan.
Thus, eventually people will see the truth.	Ta haka ne a ƙarshe mutane za su ga gaskiya.
They are beautiful.	Suna da kyau.
I heard that.	Na ji haka.
Be careful not to start flying.	A kula kada su fara tashi.
After yesterday.	Bayan jiya .
Probably not.	Wataƙila hakan bai faru ba.
You grow up, we tell each other.	Kuna girma, mun gaya wa juna.
You will probably not find happiness.	Wataƙila ba za ku sami farin ciki ba.
What is it.	Menene shi.
And you can see.	Kuma kuna iya gani.
As you.	Kamar yadda kuke.
I did not find it easy.	Ban sami hakan da sauƙi ba.
They hurt her.	Sun yi mata wahala.
So far from the best that it is hot.	Ya zuwa yanzu daga mafi kyau duka cewa yana da zafi.
You have been arrested.	An kama ku.
It is amazing.	Yana zama abin mamaki.
We decided to leave them alone.	Mun yanke shawarar barin su su kadai.
It's in your mind.	Yana cikin tunanin ku.
I do not want to see.	Ba na son gani.
He was surprised to learn the story.	Ya yi mamakin sanin labarin.
This happened the following way.	Wannan ya faru ta hanya mai zuwa.
You can never do that.	Ba za ku taɓa yin hakan ba.
There is nothing that you can do to change that.	Babu abin da za ku yi da zai canza wannan.
It works well.	Yana aiki da kyau.
Traveling on this first day is not easy.	Tafiya a wannan rana ta farko ba ta da sauƙi.
I'll give something for a drink, just drink.	Zan ba da wani abu don abin sha, kawai sha.
But this is still a recognizable world.	Amma wannan har yanzu duniya ce da ake iya gane ta.
But we can't let her go.	Amma ba za mu iya barin ta ba.
Your name.	Sunan ku.
They are not intelligent.	Ba su da hankali.
Hakuri na ya saye.	Hakuri na ya sanye.
I think he can sue for defamation.	Ina tsammanin zai iya kai kara don bata masa suna.
But she did not kill him.	Amma ba ta kashe shi ba.
Secondly, do it right.	Abu na biyu, ku yi daidai da shi.
I don't like you here.	Ba na son ku a nan.
I love you so much.	Ina son ku sosai.
Put it with it.	A sanya shi da ita.
You know what we want.	Kun san abin da muke so.
We're honestly, though.	Mun yi gaskiya, ko da yake.
The future is much sooner than that.	Gaba yana da yawa nan da nan fiye da haka.
Who is this man?	Wanene wannan mutumin?
I have no answer.	Ba ni da wata amsa.
That would be very difficult.	Wannan zai yi wuya sosai.
That is not enough.	Wannan bai isa ba.
It made me think.	Ya sanya ni tunani.
Women are attractive.	Mata suna da ban sha'awa.
There is food waiting for you.	Akwai abinci yana jiran ku.
Nothing really helped.	Babu wani abu da ya taimaka sosai.
You asked me.	Kun tambaye ni.
They make you sleepy.	Suna sa ku barci.
She should not have died.	Bai dace ta mutu ba.
She was right where she was.	Ta kasance daidai inda take.
It's very exciting.	Abin farin ciki ne sosai.
She should read more.	Kamata yayi ta kara karatu.
Thus.	Ta haka ne.
He gave him nothing.	Bai bashi komai ba.
I bought it there.	Na saya a wurin.
You do it because it catches you.	Kuna yi ne saboda yana kama ku.
But they do too.	Amma su ma suna yi.
It is too hot to walk.	Yana da zafi sosai don tafiya.
Man go back there.	Mutumin ku koma can.
But there is.	Amma akwai.
Now get out of the way.	Yanzu tashi daga hanya.
Most often, they are not even thought about.	Mafi sau da yawa, ba a ma ba su tunani.
I can't go with you today.	Ba zan iya tafiya tare da ku a yau ba.
It is our product.	Kayan mu ne.
It started with one place.	Ya fara da wuri ɗaya.
Now go with you.	Yanzu tafi tare da ku.
And we need them urgently.	Kuma muna bukatar su da sauri.
I am always.	Ni ne ko da yaushe.
I want to see the world.	Ina son ganin duniya.
But no one really knows.	Amma babu wanda ya sani da gaske.
It's handmade from here.	Aikin hannu ne daga nan.
He wanted to be here today.	Ya so ya kasance a nan yau.
We want to be with you.	Mun so mu kasance tare da ku.
They know what they are up to.	Sun san abin da suke ciki.
I want to hear everything you can tell me.	Ina so in ji duk abin da za ku iya gaya mani.
And they hated him.	Kuma sun ƙi shi.
Serious mistake.	Mummunan kuskure.
Someone is waiting for us to come out.	Wani yana jira mu fito.
I would recommend it to everyone.	Zan ba da shawarar ta ga kowa da kowa.
He would not mind.	Ba zai damu ba.
He thought it was a good idea.	Ya yi tunanin hakan hanya ce mai kyau.
In the end, she will do more than that.	A ƙarshe, za ta yi fiye da haka.
They just let them stand.	Sai kawai suka bar su su tsaya.
Of course that will help.	Tabbas hakan zai taimaka.
Rain will come later, but not now.	Ruwan sama zai zo daga baya, amma ba yanzu ba.
The sun was hot and he was ready to go.	Rana ta yi zafi ya shirya ya tafi.
It will be so.	Zai kasance haka.
An error occurred.	Wani kuskure ya faru.
Kill with you, now.	Kashe tare da ku, yanzu.
Maybe they know better than we do.	Wataƙila sun san ma fiye da mu.
But she returned immediately.	Amma ta koma nan take.
There is no place to go.	Babu wurin zuwa.
I have a few more.	Ina da sauran 'yan kaɗan.
Very comfortable to take.	Jin dadi sosai don ɗauka.
I heard you go out in the morning.	Na ji ka fita da safe.
He signed up.	Ya sa hannu sama.
They are not mine.	Ba nawa bane.
He has always been with us.	Ya kasance tare da mu koyaushe.
He will not talk to me.	Ba zai yi min magana ba.
He is lying.	Karya yake yi.
If we live by this.	Idan muna rayuwa ta wannan.
They can do this.	Za su iya yin wannan.
She knew what had happened to me.	Ta san abin da ya faru da ni.
She decided that she must be tired.	Ta yanke shawarar cewa lallai ta gaji.
But he is there.	Amma yana can.
He will understand this.	Zai gane wannan.
The best thing you can do is do what you did.	Mafi kyawun abin da za ku iya yi shi ne abin da kuka yi.
And there is a problem.	Kuma akwai matsala.
So it could be someone else.	Don haka yana iya zama wani.
There is also.	Akwai kuma.
You have to make sure these things don't happen.	Dole ne ku tabbatar da waɗannan abubuwan ba su faru ba.
I want to play for the event.	Ina son yin wasa ga taron.
I want to talk.	Ina son yin magana.
They must act immediately.	Dole ne su yi aiki nan da nan.
He was not ready.	Bai shirya ba.
Or is it ?.	Ko ita?.
And we do not have time.	Kuma ba mu da lokacin.
You may have a problem.	Kuna iya samun matsala.
There has been some progress.	An sami ɗan ci gaba.
Why are you wearing this dress?	Me yasa kuke sa wannan rigar?
They will do the same to me.	Haka kuma za su yi min.
I feel it.	Ina jin shi.
This is the way of truth.	Wannan ita ce hanyar gaskiya.
I refuse to work.	Na ƙi aiki.
It grows fast.	Yana da girma da sauri.
Killed or not.	An kashe ko a'a.
That made me stop crying.	Hakan yasa na daina kuka.
They are great at it.	Suna da girma a kai.
With another.	Da wani.
Some study better than others.	Wasu suna yin karatu mafi kyau fiye da wasu.
I didn't even tell anyone.	Ban ma gaya wa kowa ba.
She may have been seriously injured.	Wataƙila ta ji rauni sosai.
The dog was killed.	An kashe kare.
They all ran one way or another.	Duk sun gudu ta wata hanya ko wata.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya bane.
It is large and open.	Yana da girma kuma bude.
It's true.	Gaskiya ne.
Get to know them before you meet them !.	Ku san su kafin ku hadu da su!.
To disturb everyone.	Don damu kowa.
And for a year they seemed to be using it happily.	Kuma har shekara guda kamar suna amfani da shi cikin farin ciki.
He would not have been there.	Da bai kasance a wurin ba.
Some think that you will.	Wasu suna tsammanin za ku yi hakan.
It's good for her.	Yana da kyau a gare ta.
Still, she is safe.	Duk da haka, tana tafiya lafiya.
And this is often true.	Kuma wannan sau da yawa gaskiya ne.
Do the same here.	A nan ma a yi wannan.
This is not comfortable.	Wannan ba dadi.
That's exactly what you answered now.	Shi ne ainihin abin da kuka amsa yanzu.
Everything went right from here.	Komai ya tafi daidai daga nan.
To this day, they do not.	Har yau, ba su da.
He saw her rise.	Ya ga ta tashi.
It is difficult to work without passion.	Yana da wuya a yi aiki ba tare da sha'awar ba.
Prepare your equipment for the trip.	Shirya kayan aikin ku don tafiya.
It was met.	An hadu.
That's why you got sick in the first place.	Shi ya sa ka yi rashin lafiya tun farko.
It's just.	Abin kawai.
You know them.	Kun san su.
They are just amazing.	Suna da ban mamaki kawai.
A sadness came over me.	Wani bakin ciki ya zo min.
She went out.	Ta fita.
But even that is sometimes difficult.	Amma ko da hakan wani lokacin yana da wahala.
We have so much to do in the morning.	Muna da abubuwa da yawa da za mu yi da safe.
He was very interested.	Ya kasance mai sha'awar sosai.
Accept it as it is.	Yarda da haka kamar yadda yake.
She was exactly the right person.	Ta kasance daidai mutumin da ya dace.
You will not do it after one year.	Ba za ku yi shi ba bayan shekara guda.
They don't want me to travel alone.	Ba sa son in yi tafiya ni kaɗai.
They are here.	Suna nan.
This is better.	Wannan ya fi kyau.
Keep talking to him.	Ci gaba da yi masa magana.
It is easy to see why this is so.	Yana da sauƙi a ga dalilin da ya sa hakan ya zama haka.
Sadness fixed me.	Bakin ciki ya gyara min.
I want the next one.	Ina son na gaba.
Why, he does not know.	Don me, bai sani ba.
What! 	Menene!
Yet growing up is ridiculous.	Duk da haka girma girma abu ne mai ban dariya.
She ran fast.	Ta gudu da sauri.
It looks like here.	Yana kama da a nan.
So, we have to start now.	Don haka, dole ne mu fara yanzu.
I did not ask him.	Ban tambaye shi ba.
Good thing.	Abu mai kyau.
Two children, daughters.	Yara biyu, mata.
He seems to have not received a response to the demand.	Da alama bai samu amsa ga bukatar ba.
It looks good on him.	Kamar yayi masa kyau.
We agree with that.	Mun yarda da hakan.
That person can.	Wannan mutumin zai iya.
Give it to her.	Ka ba ta.
There is no place like home.	Babu wuri kamar gida.
But this is also not true.	Amma wannan kuma ba gaskiya ba ne.
I hate me.	Na ƙi ni.
The celebration was over.	Bikin ya yi farin ciki.
I think he will, one day.	Ina tsammanin zai yi, wata rana.
I saw it once or twice.	Na ga sau ɗaya ko sau biyu.
I used to do things I never finished.	Na kasance ina yin abubuwa ban gama su ba.
I will not accept that.	Ba zan yarda da hakan ba.
That never happened.	Hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
The end is just right.	Karshen daidai da wuri.
It feels good.	Ya ji dadi.
It's time they arrested.	Lokaci ya yi da suka kama.
I know it is me.	Na san yana da ni.
He was obviously wrong.	Babu shakka ya yi kuskure.
I like it that way.	Ina son shi haka.
If you are honest? 	Idan kai mai gaskiya ne?
he would say.	zai ce.
Injury, but better.	Rauni, amma mafi kyau.
So she went out.	Don haka ta fita.
We have a place for you.	Muna da wurin zama a gare ku.
It’s not like there’s anything interesting outside.	Ba kamar akwai wani abu mai ban sha'awa a waje ba.
How are you? 	Komai lafiya?
However, know that there is nothing to fear.	Duk da haka, ku sani cewa babu abin da za ku ji tsoro.
What should you do?	Me ya kamata ku yi?
They came again a week later.	Sai suka sake zuwa bayan mako guda.
She has two or three children.	Tana da yara biyu ko uku.
Give him a chance to show you he has changed.	Ka ba shi dama ya nuna maka ya canza.
It worked.	Ya yi aiki.
But they will not.	Amma ba za su yi ba.
I work.	Na aiki.
How much can you take, and keep going.	Nawa za ku iya ɗauka, kuma ku ci gaba da ci gaba.
I want more than what I have.	Ina son fiye da abin da nake da shi.
The end of me.	Karshen ni.
He alone knows it is true.	Shi kadai ya san shi gaskiya ne.
Learn last night.	Koyi daren jiya.
It is not finished yet.	Har yanzu ba a gama ba.
The world will be a much better place.	Duniya za ta zama wuri mafi kyau.
There were two other girls there.	Wasu 'yan mata biyu ne a wurin.
It's fun and funny.	Yana da daɗi da ban dariya.
I want my dog.	Ina son kare na.
And really sad, if you think about it.	Kuma da gaske bakin ciki, idan ka yi tunani game da shi.
I love it!.	Ina so shi!.
She used to work for you.	Ta kasance tana yi muku aiki.
As it were.	Kamar yadda ya kasance.
Wow, everyone has it.	Kai, kowa yana da shi.
She goes in and closes it.	Tana shiga ta rufe ta.
It doesn't feel right.	Bai ji daidai ba.
We can get them.	Za mu iya samun su.
She always enjoys seeing.	Kullum tana jin daɗin gani.
The man was injured.	Mutumin ya ji rauni.
It has a lot of people to take care of.	Yana da mutane da yawa da za su kula da shi.
He has been there for a while now.	Ya kasance a can na ɗan lokaci yanzu.
They cut us off completely.	Sun yanke mu gaba daya.
If so, do it.	Idan wannan, yi haka.
There is both too much and too little.	Akwai duka da yawa kuma kadan ne.
Then we left.	Sai mun tafi.
He could not hear her.	Ya kasa jin ta.
She thought when she started it would be so.	Ta yi tunanin lokacin da ta fara haka zai kasance.
He was told to get up.	Sai aka ce masa ya tashi.
They are tired of traveling.	Tafiya suka gaji.
Next thing.	Abu na gaba.
They are just watching.	Kallon kawai suke.
I tried to talk about it.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin magana game da hakan.
It's just cold.	Sanyi ne kawai.
I took a little time.	Na dauki lokaci kadan.
He was just.	Ya kasance kawai.
But that is interesting.	Amma hakan yana da ban sha'awa.
He is not my dog.	Ba kare na ba ne.
If he really wants to, he can do it twice.	Idan da gaske yana so, zai iya yin hakan sau biyu.
It tastes good.	Yana da daɗi a sha.
He accepts this now.	Ya yarda da haka yanzu.
Good one.	Guda mai kyau.
He really wants to be with her.	Yana son zama da ita sosai.
It made me feel it again.	Ya sake sa ni ji.
Funny stuff too.	Kayan ban dariya ma.
Like they never came.	Kamar ba su taɓa zuwa ba.
He does not need to be with her.	Ba ya bukatar zama da ita.
Is that so.	Shin haka ne.
Lunch was over for him.	Abincin rana ta wuce masa.
No one is visible.	Babu kowa a gani.
She studied with them at school.	Wanda ta yi karatu da su a makaranta.
In fact it is good, maybe even great.	A gaskiya yana da kyau, watakila ma mai girma.
However, things are not so simple.	Duk da haka kuma, abubuwa ba su da sauƙi haka.
I enjoy that.	Ina jin daɗin hakan.
He lives near the train station.	Yana zaune kusa da tashar jirgin kasa.
It is something they want.	Abu ne da suke so.
I will not give up.	Ba zan daina ba.
I do my best every day though.	Ina yin mafi kyau kowace rana ko da yake.
I tried, believe me.	Na gwada, yarda da ni.
She said.	Ta fad'a.
Not fast, not slow.	Ba da sauri ba, ba a hankali ba.
Apparently everyone is waiting for this.	Da alama kowa yana jiran wannan.
They feel it is a woman's job.	Suna jin cewa aikin mata ne.
And they worked.	Kuma sun yi aiki.
He took a drink.	Ya ɗauki wani abin sha.
How do you know if you are happy?	Ta yaya za ku san ko kuna farin ciki?
Just try it.	Kawai gwada shi.
Travel is difficult.	Tafiya ke da wuya.
She has no one in the world.	Ba ta da kowa a duniya.
I just tell you to talk to people.	Ina gaya muku kawai ku yi magana da mutane.
He felt he did not hear.	Ya ji bai ji ba.
Or do you want to do.	Ko kuna son yi.
Little have been tried.	Kadan ma sun gwada.
Or someone else.	Ko kuma wani.
It will probably rain tomorrow.	Wataƙila za a yi ruwan sama gobe.
, when they fell asleep.	, lokacin da suka yi barci.
Another surprise for you.	Wani abin mamaki gare ku.
They are not needed.	Ba a buƙatar su.
Of course we can't do anything like that.	Tabbas ba za mu iya yin komai irin wannan ba.
The plane took off.	Jirgin ya tashi.
They broke it nicely there.	Sun karya shi da kyau a can.
Give things a chance.	Ka ba abubuwa dama.
He sat down.	Ya zauna.
It helps to find someone to talk to.	Yana taimaka a sami wanda za ku yi magana da shi.
The day really started	Ranar ta fara sosai
Others came to the rescue.	Wasu kuma suka je suka taimake su a gida.
They want money, she thought.	Kudi suke so, ta yi tunani.
Everything is gone.	Komai ya tafi.
They do not work.	Ba sa aiki.
Could he make a mistake.	Shin zai iya yin kuskure.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Don Allah a ba ni labarin ku.
Exactly two years ago.	Daidai da shekaru biyu da suka gabata.
He goes in and closes the door.	Yana shiga ya rufe kofar.
It's really bad right now.	Yana da mummunan gaske a yanzu.
And you don't care about others.	Kuma ba ku damu da wasu ba.
It is better not to forget that.	Gara kar a manta da haka.
This in itself is not a big deal.	Shi kansa wannan ba wani babban abu bane.
Mealtime.	Lokacin cin abinci.
And he knows everything.	Kuma ya san komai.
So we sat down.	Sai muka zauna.
She must be here somewhere.	Dole ta kasance a nan wani wuri.
Anyone who knows her knows the truth.	Duk wanda ya san ta ya san gaskiya.
There is no way we are going to do them much.	Babu yadda za mu yi da su da yawa.
In a good way, of course.	A hanya mai kyau, ba shakka.
But they are amazing.	Amma suna da ban mamaki.
Everything is fine in the world.	Komai yayi daidai a duniya.
He asked me many things.	Ya tambaye ni abubuwa da dama.
Or, you can go to it.	Ko, za ku iya zuwa gare ta.
But it seems good, for some.	Amma alama mai kyau, ga wasu.
Everyone was running at the time.	Kowa yana gudu a lokacin.
There is still something they need to do.	Har yanzu akwai wani abu da suke bukatar yi.
No one wants to be left out of something.	Babu wanda yake son a bar shi daga cikin wani abu.
It will be fun.	Zai zama abin daɗi.
For a while nothing showed.	Na ɗan lokaci babu abin da ya nuna.
I think you do.	Ina tsammanin kun yi.
She went back and forth, lost for words.	Ta yi gaba da baya, ta rasa me zata ce.
I have never seen you.	Ban taba ganin ku ba.
Some have it.	Wasu suna da shi.
Lots of thoughts.	Yawan tunani da yawa.
Remember that this was good many years ago.	Ka tuna cewa wannan yayi kyau shekaru da yawa da suka wuce.
I did it all while I was working.	Na yi duka a lokacin da nake aiki.
My children are eating.	Yara na suna ci.
It could not be found off.	An kasa samun hakan a kashe.
I had to get used to it quickly.	Dole na saba da shi da sauri.
But he is gone now.	Amma ya tafi yanzu.
We drink coffee and talk.	Muna shan kofi muna magana.
I became very serious and had some fun.	Na zama da gaske kuma na ɗan ji daɗi.
But of course you have to do what you think is right.	Amma ba shakka dole ne ku yi yadda kuke tunani daidai.
It's fine, but it's fine if you don't have a car.	Yana da kyau, amma yana da kyau idan ba ku da mota.
My boat is leaving.	Jirgin ruwa na yana tashi.
Just get people to stop reading them.	Kawai a sa mutane su daina karanta su.
Drinking cold water in the morning is good.	Shan ruwan sanyi da safe yana da kyau.
Since then no one has arrived enough.	Tun daga lokacin babu wanda ya isa ya isa.
Lie to me, lie to me, lie to me.	Karya ni, karya ni, karya ni.
We can succeed.	Za mu iya yin nasara.
She reads to him every night.	Kullum dare tana karanta masa.
Now you need to do something about it.	Yanzu kana bukatar ka yi wani abu game da shi.
You do not even know who it is.	Ba ma ku san wanene ba.
Although it can take years.	Ko da yake yana iya ɗaukar shekaru.
They can not be otherwise.	Ba za su iya zama in ba haka ba.
This is nothing new.	Wannan ba sabon abu ba ne.
He could not speak.	Ya kasa magana.
For the first time, they traveled only a short distance.	A karo na farko sun yi tafiya kaɗan ne kawai.
I'm changing somehow.	Ina canza ko ta yaya.
This is what you want and what you will get.	Abin da kuke so kuma abin da za ku samu ke nan.
He got up again.	Ya sake tashi.
I stopped today to take a closer look.	Na tsaya yau don in duba sosai.
We're just looking for a name.	Muna neman suna kawai.
I said yes, boy.	Na ce haka, yaro.
I will not talk to you about it.	Ba zan yi muku magana game da shi ba.
It will pass.	Zai wuce.
I kept saying that once, but not too hot.	Na ci gaba da cewa sau ɗaya, amma ba zafi sosai.
She didn't trust me.	Ba ta yarda da ni ba.
He will not miss anything.	Ba zai rasa komai ba.
Just a little attention.	Hankali kadan kawai.
The food crisis is huge.	Matsalar abinci tana da girma.
I think she was right about that.	Ina ganin ta yi gaskiya game da hakan.
It should not be difficult for them to talk about this.	Bai kamata ya yi wuya a sa su magana game da wannan ba.
You really do.	Kuna yi da gaske.
Call him.	Kira shi .
That is what will come of it.	Abin da zai zo daga gare ta ke nan.
It made me feel good that someone was upset.	Ya sanya ni jin dadi cewa wani ya damu.
It’s not just what I do.	Ba abin da nake yi ba ne kawai.
We recommend that you leave it at that.	Muna ba da shawarar ku bar hakan.
And we don't want that.	Kuma ba za mu so hakan ba.
He knew that, if anyone did.	Ya san cewa, idan wani ya yi.
She had to go for a while.	Sai da ta tafi wani lokaci.
Kids love them.	Yara suna son su.
It never happened.	Bai taba faruwa ba.
Please, get out of the way!	Don Allah, ku fita daga hanya!
The room is cold.	Dakin yayi sanyi.
They never did anything.	Ba su taɓa yin komai ba.
So he got up and looked for real food.	Don haka ya tashi ya nemi abinci na gaske.
He had to keep it behind.	Dole ya ajiye ta a baya.
This is my correction.	Wannan shine irin gyara na.
It's about intelligence.	Yana da game da hankali.
I’m talking about kids.	Ina magana game da yara.
Some, perhaps not.	Wasu, watakila ba haka ba ne.
They have little more than knowledge.	Ba su da fiye da ɗan sani.
Are you ready ?.	Kun shirya?.
You are a runner, after all.	Kai mai gudu ne, bayan haka.
So, there you are.	Don haka, akwai ku.
Good things here.	Abubuwa masu kyau a nan.
It is my favorite.	Shi ne na fi so.
He decided to commit suicide.	Ya yanke shawarar kashe kansa.
I must know.	Dole ne in sani.
But nothing has changed.	Amma babu abin da ya canza.
No answer, of course.	Babu amsa, ba shakka.
Or anyone.	Ko kowa.
They found nothing, of course.	Ba su sami komai ba, ba shakka.
Now there you see, give me one.	Yanzu can ka gani, ka ba ni daya.
His equipment is not very comfortable.	Kayan sa ba su da daɗi sosai.
It wasn't until he got to that point.	Sai da ya kai ga hakan.
There is nothing to do.	Babu wani abu da za a yi.
However, he apologized immediately.	Duk da haka, ya ba da hakuri nan take.
He has a reputation for dishonesty.	Ya yi suna da rashin gaskiya.
You know the rest.	Ka san sauran.
Tell her you missed the bus.	Ka gaya mata kun rasa bas ɗin.
We lived together for three years.	Mun zauna tare har tsawon shekaru uku.
He does not need to be now.	Ba ya buƙatar zama yanzu.
All this, this time.	Duk wannan, wannan lokacin.
Which never really happened.	Wanda bai taba faruwa da gaske ba.
They seem to have reached something fishy.	Suna kamar sun kai wani abu mai kifi.
A kind of interest.	Wani irin sha'awa.
He assumed that others would know what he was planning to do.	Ya dauka cewa wasu za su san abin da yake shirin yi.
Just let the fear be there.	Kawai bari tsoro ya kasance a can.
If you do not log in, it will come back to try a little later.	Idan ba ka shiga, zai dawo ya gwada kadan daga baya.
You too are not human.	Kai ma ba mutum ba ne.
I can’t seem to get anything to work.	Ba zan iya zama kamar in sami wani abu don aiki ba.
Life today.	Rayuwa yau.
Eleven people were killed.	Mutum 11 ne suka mutu.
But everything is still the same.	Amma duk abin ya kasance har yanzu.
And it makes me wonder why.	Kuma yana sa ni mamakin dalilin.
I have a lot of pain.	Ina jin zafi sosai.
I think he did.	Ina tsammanin ya yi.
It's hard to say now.	Yana da wuya a fada yanzu.
At the time I did not know him.	A lokacin ban san shi ba.
I am all three.	Ni duka uku ne.
I know you do.	Na san kuna yi.
He must be tired!	Dole ne ya gaji!
And for a while, she had.	Kuma na ɗan lokaci, tana da.
They can fix this.	Za su iya gyara wannan.
That fits in with who we are.	Wannan ya yi daidai da wanda muke.
I have come to take you home.	Na zo in kai ku gida.
I still think of you.	Har yanzu ina tunanin ku.
Do not go there.	Kar ku je can.
Or not at all.	Ko ba gaba ɗaya ba.
I thought you would like to hear.	Na yi tsammanin za ku so ku ji .
Tell me what you want.	Faɗa mini abin da kuke so.
Otherwise it will be very weak.	In ba haka ba za ta yi rauni sosai.
I do not know how.	Ban san yadda ba.
I take care of my child.	Ina kula da yaro na.
It's an easy way.	Yana da hanya mai sauƙi.
I took my time.	Na dauka lokaci na ne.
We will be there.	Za mu kasance a can.
But it did not come.	Amma bata zo ba.
Without these people.	Ba tare da waɗannan mutane ba.
I told him to come.	Na ce masa ya zo.
And she knows that.	Kuma ta san haka.
But it may not be so.	Amma yana iya zama ba haka ba.
I have a cold	Na yi sanyi
You learn to see it that way.	Kuna koyi ganin ta haka.
And now you think it's nothing without him.	Kuma yanzu kuna tunanin ba komai ba ne in ba shi ba.
No, you will only start with the lost day.	A'a, kawai za ku fara da ranar bata.
It is almost time for a fight.	Ya kusa lokacin fada.
They can say anything.	Za su iya cewa komai.
Come and forget it.	Ku zo ku manta da shi.
There are things you do not know.	Akwai abubuwan da ba ku sani ba.
Sorry but it's true.	Yi hakuri amma gaskiya ne.
Get out of here, he said.	Ku fita nan, ya ce.
This in itself is interesting.	Wannan a cikin kansa yana da ban sha'awa.
Have you heard before?	Kun ji a baya?
Think once and for all.	Yi tunani sau ɗaya.
I think we will see.	Ina tsammanin za mu gani.
Let's fix it, let's do it right.	Mu gyara, mu yi daidai.
At the same time three things happened.	A cikin lokaci guda abubuwa uku sun faru.
She will come here.	Zata zo nan.
Maybe it's good.	Wataƙila yana da kyau.
I think it's a good thing.	Ina tsammanin abu ne mai kyau.
Get in the car!	Yi sauri ku shiga mota!
I want to bring you some.	Ina so in kawo muku wasu.
Do the least.	Shin ko kadan.
However, you do not have to worry about that.	Ko ta yaya, ba lallai ne ku damu da hakan ba.
Must be available.	Dole ne akwai.
I remember everything about it.	Ina tuna komai game da shi.
Not like you did, of course.	Ba kamar yadda kuka yi ba, ba shakka.
I have to stop.	Dole in tsaya.
This is not the end of the story.	Wannan ba shine karshen labarin ba.
That would be sad for some to see.	Hakan zai zama bakin ciki ga wasu su gani.
I feel very well.	Ina jin lafiya sosai.
For me it really works.	A gare ni da gaske yana aiki.
Even though he is not well, today he will work.	Duk da cewa ba shi da lafiya, yau zai yi aiki.
Maybe I wrote as he did.	Wataƙila na rubuta kamar yadda ya yi.
We only recommend the best !.	Muna ba da shawarar mafi kyau kawai!.
We have your back.	Muna da bayan ku.
And one day it will lead to the next.	Kuma wata rana zai kai ga gaba.
Everything he says is his own work.	Duk abin da ya ce, aikin kansa ne.
No one, not even me.	Babu kowa, har da ni.
Let's eat now.	Mu ci abinci yanzu.
But this is a funny idea.	Amma wannan tunani ne na ban dariya.
It's not just a mistake.	Ba kawai kuskure ba ne.
What an amazing movie!	Wane fim ne mai ban sha'awa!
This dog is so cute.	Wannan kare ya yi kyau sosai.
I keep them on my own.	Ina ajiye su a kaina.
One of many.	Daya daga cikin mutane da yawa.
He will be back.	Zai dawo.
You do not want it to be thoughtful.	Ba ka so ya zama abin tunani.
What is all this?	Menene wannan duka?.
What he said is not true.	Abin da ya fada ba gaskiya ba ne.

You are not my child.	Kai ba yaro na bane.
Nothing happened.	Babu wani abu da ya faru.
I tried to do things.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin abubuwa.
Best of all time.	Mafi kyawun koyaushe.
The second is money.	Na biyu shine kudi.
This contradicted me once.	Wannan ya saba da ni sau ɗaya.
Do not accept them.	Kada ku yarda da su.
He kept filling it.	Ya ci gaba da cika shi.
I want it to open for me.	Ina so ya bude min.
What's the matter? 	Akwai wata matsala?
We can get it.	Za mu iya samun shi.
But we did not know that at the time.	Amma ba mu san hakan ba a lokacin.
We are one, but without each other.	Mu daya ne, amma ban da juna.
First, it is not true.	Na farko, ba gaskiya ba ne.
He started passing me and running.	Ya fara wuce ni da gudu.
Not necessarily.	Ba lallai ba ne.
I'm fine.	Ina da kyau.
Of course he has money.	Tabbas yana da kudi.
But that is only sometimes.	Amma hakan wani lokaci ne kawai.
We must be able to help each other.	Dole ne mu iya taimakon juna.
I will not go home.	Ba zan tafi gida ba.
I'm not saying it's good.	Ba na cewa yana da kyau.
Or a second.	Ko na biyu.
The way people talk to you is nothing.	Yadda mutane ke yin magana da ku ba komai bane.
It's like mine.	Kamar nawa ne.
We see them every day.	Muna ganin su kowace rana.
He died as man could have.	Ya mutu kamar yadda mutum zai iya samu.
Great for school and play.	Mai girma ga makaranta da wasa.
I agree with what you have done here.	Na yarda da abubuwan da kuka yi a nan.
But now the story has come out to the world.	Amma yanzu labarin ya fito ga duniya.
But there are still a few people about.	Amma har yanzu akwai 'yan mutane game da.
We can think of this in some way.	Za mu iya yin tunani game da wannan a wata hanya.
Man did that.	Mutum ya yi haka.
You will love them.	Za ku so su.
Before the sun came up, he was there.	Kafin rana ta fito, yana can.
But nothing is found.	Amma ba a samun komai.
It did me really good.	Ya yi min kyau sosai.
Whatever you want to call them.	Duk abin da kuke so ku kira su.
He is useful.	Shi mai amfani ne.
They almost got there.	Sun kusan zuwa wurin.
I do not see the need either.	Ni ma ban ga bukata ba.
Everyone thinks it’s best to stick with what works.	Kowa ya yi tunanin ya fi kyau a tsaya tare da abin da ke aiki.
There is little to say.	Akwai kadan da za a ce.
That can do well.	Hakan na iya yin kyau.
You may want to check it out.	Kuna iya son duba shi.
As has been the case in many parts of the world.	Kamar yadda aka yi da yawa a duniya.
We must go into this carefully.	Dole ne mu shiga cikin wannan a hankali.
I really don't know what is best.	A gaskiya ban san abin da ya fi kyau ba.
She loves children.	Tana son yara.
Which surprised me.	Wanda ya bani mamaki.
I think it hurts.	Ina tsammanin hakan yayi zafi.
He left sad, but he left.	Ya tafi da bakin ciki, amma ya tafi.
Maybe it's time of year.	Wataƙila lokacin shekara ne.
One open one closed.	Daya bude daya rufe.
The book is fine, if you ask me.	Littafin lafiya ne, idan kun tambaye ni.
But big money no.	Amma babban kudi a'a.
She went out and sat down.	Ta fita ya zauna.
But the police did.	Amma 'yan sanda sun yi.
No one can know.	Babu wanda zai iya sani.
Do whatever you do.	Yi duk abin da kuke yi.
When I killed him they saw.	Da na kashe shi sai su gani.
We used to live in the heat.	Mun saba zama cikin zafi.
And that is exactly what we are seeing here.	Kuma shi ne ainihin abin da muke gani a nan.
And maybe that's the case.	Kuma watakila hakan ma haka yake.
Cutting right.	Yanke yayi daidai.
He wants to be loved.	Yana son a so.
God is with you.	Allah yana tare da ku.
It is something a person can do or cannot do.	Abu ne da mutum zai iya yi ko ba zai iya yi ba.
And it's more accurate.	Kuma ya fi daidai.
He knew what he was interested in too.	Ya san abin da yake sha'awar ita ma.
She cries a lot.	Kuka ta yi mai zafi.
I called him and talked to him.	Na kira shi na yi magana da shi.
She recognized him by the way he walked.	Ta gane shi ta hanyar da yake tafiya.
She will get this look for a while.	Za ta sami wannan kallon na ɗan lokaci.
Twice, he refused.	Sau biyu, ya ƙi.
I even talked to her.	Har na yi mata magana.
No one will touch him.	Ba wanda zai taɓa shi.
He said he would see what he would get.	Ya ce zai ga abin da zai samu.
This conclusion is very fitting.	Wannan ƙarshe ya dace sosai.
I don’t feel there is anything we can do more than that.	Ba na jin akwai wani abu da za mu iya yi fiye da haka.
Growing up through play.	Girma ta hanyar wasa.
And if you haven't heard of it, you'll love it too.	Kuma idan ba ku ji shi ba, za ku so shi ma.
Stay in your room.	Ku zauna a dakin ku.
Time, there just seems to be enough.	Lokaci, akwai kawai kamar bai isa ba.
One is coffee.	Guda daya shine kofi.
It may be weak but the rest of us too.	Yana iya zama mai rauni amma sauran mu ma.
I said call me when you start writing something new.	Na ce ku kira ni idan kun fara rubuta sabon abu.
I see no reason why you should not do something this way.	Ban ga dalilin da zai sa ba za ku yi wani abu ta wannan hanyar ba.
I didn’t think it would work.	Ban yi tsammanin zai yi aiki ba.
That should be the case.	Haka ya kamata ya kasance.
I'm sure it will work really well.	Na tabbata zai yi aiki sosai.
I feel that way.	Na ji haka sosai.
Maybe there are things she can find out about him.	Wataƙila akwai abubuwan da ta iya gano game da shi.
We are moving fast in trouble.	Muna tafiya cikin sauri cikin matsala.
But that doesn't matter.	Amma duk da haka hakan ba komai.
They do not have.	Ba su da.
We are human and we are in this together.	Mu mutane ne kuma muna cikin wannan tare.
The day I did not cut.	Ranar ban yanke ba.
This made us work longer hours.	Wannan ya sa mu yi aiki har tsawon lokaci.
One day he left and did not return.	Wata rana ya tafi bai dawo ba.
I knew it would be good.	Na san zai yi kyau.
He knew him, they knew him.	Ya san shi, sun san shi.
At the end.	A karshen.
You are not out of work.	Ba ku daga aiki.
They can't do that, can they?	Ba za su iya yin haka ba, ko?
He did not go.	Ba shi ne ya tafi ba.
You could say no one wants to be there.	Kuna iya cewa babu wanda yake son zama a wurin.
It is a hot day.	Rana ce mai zafi.
Whatever you want.	Duk abin da kuke so.
He decided for himself.	Ya yanke shawarar kansa.
Then we did not speak again for a moment.	Daga nan ba mu sake yin magana ba na ɗan lokaci.
About the ship.	Game da jirgin.
They know her well.	Sun san ta sosai.
They have no back.	Ba su da baya.
The man worked.	Mutumin yayi aiki.
She is here and interested in the project.	Tana nan kuma tana sha'awar aikin.
That did not work well.	Hakan bai yi kyau ba.
I will check the book.	Zan duba littafin.
But he did not believe her, not really.	Amma bai yarda da ita ba, ba da gaske ba.
Sadness is like the outside.	Bakin ciki yayi kamar waje.
If you want to go, let's go.	Idan kuna son tafiya, mu tafi.
I know you can't talk about it.	Na san ba za ku iya magana a kai ba.
How many years have you been here?	Shekaru nawa kuka yi a nan?
And yet of course it is amazing too.	Kuma duk da haka ba shakka yana da ban mamaki kuma.
I'm not there yet.	Ba na can tukuna.
He wanted to enjoy life to the full.	Ya so ya ji daɗin rayuwa sosai.
People will pay for everything.	Mutane za su biya komai.
This is very good.	Wannan yayi kyau sosai.
We seem to know how to play.	Da alama mun san yadda za mu yi wasa.
And another after a week.	Da kuma wani bayan mako guda.
Someone brought it to me.	Wani ya kawo min ita.
It will be three.	Za ta zama uku.
Everything he said is true.	Duk abin da ya fada gaskiya ne.
Hopefully homework will be done now.	Da fatan za a yi aikin gida yanzu.
I have to go.	Dole in tafi.
When.	Lokacin.
They probably died at any point in time.	Wataƙila sun mutu a kowane lokaci a wannan lokacin.
What time will it be?	Wani lokaci ne zai kasance?
It's exciting.	Abin farin ciki ne.
So it worked perfectly.	Don haka ya yi aiki daidai.
Go, girls.	Ku tafi, 'yan mata.
It kills me.	Tana kashe ni.
I want to show the rest of the answer again.	Ina so ya nuna sauran amsa kuma.
This is not a new place to live.	Wannan ba sabon wurin zama ba ne.
She felt comfortable.	Ta ji dadi.
Just do what is right.	Kawai yi abin da yake daidai.
Time is of the essence.	Lokaci ya fi girma.
He is playing.	Yana wasa.
They are close.	Suna kusa.
You are not used to it.	Ba ka saba da shi ba.
It will kill you just because it can.	Zai kashe ku don kawai zai iya.
And this has been very interesting.	Kuma wannan ya kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
However, check it out.	Duk da haka, duba shi.
Still, she was surprised.	Amma duk da haka, ta yi mamaki.
He was happy at first.	Ya yi farin ciki da farko.
Some are dead.	Wasu sun mutu.
But we will have time to drink.	Amma za mu sami lokacin sha.
He wanted her to be safe.	Ya so ta samu lafiya.
You are still happy.	Har yanzu kuna jin daɗi.
I will not pass her by to do anything.	Ba zan wuce ta don yin wani abu ba.
What you hear now will pass.	Abin da kuke ji a yanzu zai wuce.
So do we.	Haka da mu.
He is back but he can be killed again.	Ya dawo amma ana iya sake kashe shi.
Now he is here.	Yanzu yana nan.
And at that time.	Kuma a wannan lokacin.
Of course, that will not come.	Tabbas, hakan ba zai zo ba.
Children think that anyone who is not good is not good.	Yara suna tunanin cewa duk wanda ba shi da kyau ba shi da kyau.
I find this difficult.	Na gano hakan abu ne mai wahala.
It just won’t happen.	Kawai ba zai faru ba.
They look so good.	Sun yi kyau sosai.
We were one year old.	Mun kasance shekaru ɗaya ne.
He doesn't like to talk.	Ba ya son magana.
You got it now.	Kun samu yanzu.
It will not kill you.	Ba zai kashe ku ba.
When he really wants to he will work for it.	Lokacin da yake so da gaske zai yi aiki da shi.
It still spreads.	Ya fad'a har yanzu.
Do you think she can look anyway from the world?	Kuna tsammanin tana iya neman kowace hanya daga duniya.
I really enjoyed it.	Na ji dadi sosai da shi.
He got his man.	Ya samu mutumin sa.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
God loves women.	Allah yana son mata.
They should get it.	Kamata yayi su samu.
I love them so much.	Ina son su sosai.
I do not remember who wrote this program.	Ban tuna wanda ya rubuta wannan shirin ba.
I don't see how he can make a mistake, really.	Ban ga yadda zai iya yin kuskure ba, da gaske.
Others seem to know her first name.	Sauran kamar sun san sunan ta na farko.
And what they are now.	Kuma abin da suke a yanzu.
You must call.	Dole ne ku kira.
If we go in there now, we will not go out.	Idan muka shiga can yanzu, ba za mu fito ba.
The bus goes to school.	Bas da jirgin kasa take zuwa makaranta.
And you failed.	Kuma kun kasa.
I will not do, at all.	Ba zan yi ba, komai.
People do not want to know.	Mutane ba sa so su sani.
We must think of two ideas at a time.	Dole ne mu yi tunanin tunani guda biyu a lokaci guda.
She was the first to arrive.	Ita ce ta fara zuwa.
I never thought you could.	Ban taba tunanin za ku iya ba.
I want you to know that you are not alone.	Ina so ka sani cewa ba kai kaɗai ba ne.
You'll be fine, though.	Za ku kasance lafiya, ko da yake.
We are still doing.	Har yanzu muna kan yin.
Only truth can show you how beautiful you are.	Gaskiya ne kawai zai iya nuna maka kyawun gaske.
He said the man in the background.	Yace mutumin a baya.
Just that it looks really, really good.	Kawai cewa ya yi kama da gaske, mai kyau sosai.
Sometimes you have to work fast.	Wani lokaci dole ne ka yi aiki da sauri.
She knew at the time that she would not be able to work.	Ta san a lokacin ba za ta yi aiki ba.
I have food and water.	Ina da abinci da ruwa.
Only one you heard.	Daya kawai ka ji.
They will not come.	Ba za su zo ba.
I do not know if anyone was injured.	Ban sani ba ko wani ya ji rauni.
If not, you should not do it.	Idan ba haka ba, da kyau kar a yi.
It rains every year.	Ana yin ruwan sama duk shekara.
Or let's go.	Ko kuma mu tafi.
He went and left everything.	Ya tafi ya bar komai.
If so, it is too late.	Idan haka ne, ya makara.
This is not necessarily the best.	Wannan ba lallai ba ne mafi kyau.
Not so, until last night.	Ko ba haka ba, sai daren jiya.
It's not fun anymore.	Ba abin jin daɗi bane kuma.
Life for life.	Rayuwa don rayuwa.
I am not them.	Ni ko su.
Which really gave them a good job.	Abin da gaske ya ba su kyakkyawan aiki.
We do not like it.	Ba mu so shi.
He was interested in all of this.	Ya kasance mai sha'awar wannan duka.
So you have to tell me what to do.	Don haka dole ku gaya mani abin da zan yi.
I really want to talk to you.	Ina son magana da ku sosai.
You are right.	Kun yi daidai.
Try not to eat them.	Yi ƙoƙarin kada ku ci su.
The time has come.	Lokaci ya zo ƙarshe.
Stay close.	Tsaya kusa.
She always drives slowly.	Kullum tana tuƙi a hankali.
Now we know that we can.	Yanzu mun san cewa za mu iya.
Since then I have never been without one.	Tun daga nan ban taba zama babu daya ba.
The world is right for life.	Duniya daidai ne don rayuwa.
He would die.	Da zai mutu.
They are beautiful.	Suna da kyau.
He did this as quickly as before.	Ya yi wannan da sauri kamar na farko.
She doesn't even want to go out.	Bata ma son fita a ciki.
And you really should take care of yourself first.	Kuma da gaske yakamata ku kula da kanku tukuna.
Well, that's right.	Shi ke nan, wannan daidai ne.
Help me here, people !.	Ku taimake ni a nan, mutane!.
Let them die, he thought.	Bari su mutu, ya yi tunani.
I do not know when.	Ban san yaushe ne.
It's hard to hear.	Yana da wuya a ji.
We are traveling.	Muna tafiya.
She lived with me for many years.	Ta zauna tare da ni tsawon shekaru da yawa.
No work to be done.	Babu aikin da za a yi.
Have a nice weekend?	Kuna da kyakkyawan karshen mako?
It is as sick as illness.	Yana da rashin lafiya kamar yadda rashin lafiya ke faruwa.
Here we are now.	A nan ne muke a yanzu.
After all, though, things took a turn for the worse.	Bayan haka, duk da haka, abubuwa sun ɗauka.
This still works.	Wannan har yanzu yana ci gaba da aiki.
Come on in, take a look.	Ku zo mu shiga.
Go somewhere else.	Je zuwa wani wuri kuma.
That's right.	Hakan yayi daidai.
I think now you have got what you want.	Ina tsammanin yanzu kun sami abin da kuke so.
Here is something really.	Ga wani abu da gaske.
It is not uncommon to work on the weekends.	Ba a saba yin aiki ba a karshen mako.
He was later released.	Daga baya aka sake shi.
He knows where that man lives.	Ya san inda wannan mutumin yake zaune.
Good for us.	Yayi kyau mana.
Think about tomorrow.	Ka yi tunani game da gobe.
We live the best life we ​​can.	Muna rayuwa mafi kyau da za mu iya.
Maybe she really understood everything.	Watakila da gaske ta fahimci komai.
I have no place to give them.	Ba ni da wurin da zan ba su.
You must meet him.	Lallai ne ku hadu da shi.
They continue to wear them today.	Suna ci gaba da saka su yau.
I said nothing.	Ban ce komai ba.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
Just your money, and that's it.	Kuɗin ku kawai, kuma shi ke nan.
I will never be able to do that now.	Ba zan taba iya yin hakan ba a yanzu.
I am married.	Na yi aure.
I think you did a good job.	Ina tsammanin kun yi aiki mai kyau.
Of course not.	Tabbas ba haka bane.
We cannot be with you until you do.	Ba za mu iya zama tare da ku ba sai kun yi.
He can tell you.	Zai iya gaya maka.
Only something happened.	Wani abu ne kawai ya faru.
I could not.	Ban iya yi ba.
No child on the road.	Babu yaro a hanya.
That has to change.	Wannan dole ya canza.
Others decided to stay.	Wasu kuma suka yanke shawarar zama.
She can't be alone in the house tonight.	Ba za ta iya zama ita kaɗai a cikin gidan a daren yau ba.
She is tired.	Ta gaji.
There is also a restaurant.	Akwai kuma gidan cin abinci.
He ate.	Ya ci abinci.
Too much like one on one.	Yayi yawa kamar ɗaya akan ɗaya.
Gradually she passed here and there.	A hankali ta wuce nan da can.
No one can help you with this.	Babu wanda zai taimake ku da wannan.
I just want to give you a head up.	Ina so kawai in ba ku kai sama.
It's a good game.	Wasa ne mai kyau.
Make him suffer as she has suffered.	Ka sa shi wahala kamar yadda ta sha.
He got two.	Ya sami biyu.
They travel a lot today.	Sun yi ta tafiya da yawa yau.
It works for me.	Yana aiki a gare ni.
No answer.	Babu amsa.
I know where they are.	Na san inda suke.
You never know what it will bring.	Ba za ka taba sanin abin da za ta fito da shi ba.
The injured.	Wanda ya samu rauni.
Everyone should know that.	Ya kamata kowa ya san haka.
You can get it.	Kuna iya samun shi.
He looked around the room.	Ya kalli dakin.
I will not run with them again.	Ba zan ƙara gudu da su ba.
This is a problem of a very large world.	Wannan matsala ce ta duniya mai girma da yawa.
I still have a lot of money at the moment.	Har yanzu ina da kuɗi da yawa a wannan lokacin.
We do things right.	Muna yin abubuwa daidai.
She died, instantly.	Ta mutu, nan take.
She said that would be good.	Ta ce hakan zai yi kyau.
Feel free to leave.	Ji na fita.
You agree with that.	Kun yarda da hakan.
And a lot has been done.	Kuma an yi abubuwa da yawa.
He repaired things around the house.	Ya gyara abubuwa a kusa da gidan.
He must help us.	Dole ne ya taimake mu.
I could not find out how it works.	Na kasa gano yadda yake aiki.
It is designed for everything.	An shirya shi don komai.
They all have the same opportunities.	Duk suna da dama daidai.
Everyone knows about them.	Kowa ya san game da su.
Not the police, not the police.	Ba ‘yan sanda ba, ba ‘yan sanda ba.
I am just a human being.	Ni mutum ne kawai.
He was arrested by the police.	'Yan sanda sun kama shi.
If all goes well.	Idan komai ya tafi daidai.
I know it can be difficult to get here.	Na san yana iya zama da wahala zuwa nan.
However, this will not help the plaintiff.	Duk da haka, wannan ba zai taimaka wa mai ƙara ba.
She and him together.	Ita da shi tare.
I would be sad otherwise.	Ina bakin ciki in ba haka ba.
I want to know one more thing.	Ina so in kara sanin abu daya.
It just doesn't work.	Kawai baya aiki.
Next to him were two other people.	Kusa da shi akwai wasu mutane biyu.
They will see that.	Za su ga haka.
This is not easy for me to do.	Wannan ba shi da sauƙi a gare ni in yi.
I can take anything.	Zan iya ɗaukar komai.
I gave him one, you gave him one.	Na ba shi daya, ka ba shi daya.
is that true ???.	shin a gaskiya haka ne???.
Of course, one can do such a thing.	Tabbas, mutum zai iya yin irin wannan abu.
Up and back.	Sama da baya.
Eat lunch together.	Ku ci abincin rana tare.
But nothing.	Amma ba komai ba.
Seriously she said.	Da gaske ta fada.
It 's good to see you again.	Yana da kyau in sake ganin ku.
What it is is no home in this place.	Abin da shi ne babu gida a wannan wuri.
The same thing happened.	Hakan ma ya faru.
I do not know what they did to him.	Ban san me suka yi masa ba.
This frustrated him and he failed.	Hakan ya bata masa rai kuma ya kasa.
I changed course	Na canza hanya
Like he never wanted anything.	Kamar bai taba son komai ba.
I want to stay	Ina so in zauna
Next week is your time.	Mako na gaba shine lokacin ku.
This seems to be working.	Wannan da alama yana aiki.
This is a good thing.	Wannan abu ne mai kyau.
I made a mistake to prove it.	Na yi kuskure don tabbatar da haka.
Would you like to go with me?	Kuna so ku tafi tare da ni?
I can not even begin to describe how bad it is.	Ba zan iya ma fara bayyana yadda mummunan shi ne.
This proved to be a wise move.	Wannan ya tabbatar da tafiya mai hankali.
You are as young as you are.	Kai yaro ne kamar yadda ka kasance.
They went up and they went all the way down.	Sun tafi sama kuma sun wuce ta kowace hanya.
I want to know that.	Ina son sanin hakan.
Let's never do that.	Bari mu taba yin haka.
But there are many things.	Amma akwai abubuwa da yawa.
They can do whatever they want with you.	Za su iya yi maka duk abin da suke so.
She immediately put it on.	Nan take ta saka.
I have never seen this before.	Ban taba ganin wannan a baya ba.
He applied for the job without success.	Ya nemi aikin ba tare da nasara ba.
You have it in you.	Kuna da shi a cikin ku.
This is something you do not have to worry about.	Wannan wani abu ne da ba lallai ne ku damu ba.
I don't think so.	Bata tunanin haka.
Play with me.	Yi wasan tare da ni.
That helped a little.	Hakan ya taimaka kadan.
Stand up for your man.	Ku tsaya da mutumin ku.
I'm sure something happened.	Na tabbata cewa wani abu ya faru.
He was not sure if he should laugh or cry.	Bai tabbata ko ya kamata yayi dariya ko kuka ba.
But they are few.	Amma su 'yan kadan ne.
It is a pleasure for him.	Abin farin ciki ne a gare shi.
I want to say.	Ina so in ce.
Then we recognized the owner.	Sai muka gane mai shi.
Do not use hot or cold water.	Kada a yi amfani da ruwan zafi ko sanyi.
Now get out of here.	Yanzu fita daga nan.
Just sit inside.	Kawai zama a ciki.
Look at each other.	Duba juna.
He should pay.	Ya kamata ya biya.
They know it's not necessary.	Sun san ba dole ba ne.
This is a bad job.	Wannan mummunan aiki ne.
She loves it.	Tana son shi.
I can't but otherwise.	Ba zan iya ba amma in ba haka ba.
I try to see the best in everything.	Ina ƙoƙari in ga mafi kyau a cikin komai.
Or, so it seems.	Ko, don haka da alama.
It became real.	Sai ya zama da gaske.
He is survived by three children.	Ya bar yara uku.
I want to talk to her today.	Ina so in yi mata magana yau.
The meeting will take place tomorrow.	A gobe ne za a yi taron.
Completely responsive.	Gaba daya ta amsa.
The world is not.	Duniya ba.
That's it.	Wannan ya yi.
This car is how you succeed.	Wannan motar ita ce yadda kuka yi nasara.
I really want to hear from you.	Ina matukar son ji daga gare ku.
I used to love it.	Na kasance ina son shi.
I think she did the right thing.	Ina ganin ta yi abin da ya dace.
I hope that happens but you don't know.	Ina fatan hakan ya faru amma ba ku sani ba.
He can only see one person.	Yana iya ganin mutumin daya kawai.
I'm tired though.	Na gaji ko.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
It's one game.	Wasa daya ne.
He is not himself.	Shi ba kansa ba ne.
I'm not sure now what happened to him.	Ban tabbata yanzu me ya faru da shi ba.
Many people say that nothing can be done.	Mutane da yawa sun ce ba za a iya yin komai ba.
He made me laugh.	Ya bani dariya.
I can’t believe it works so fast.	Ba zan iya yarda cewa yana aiki da sauri ba.
Not how long you have been doing something, but how often.	Ba tsawon lokacin da kuke yin wani abu ba, amma sau nawa.
I'm scared.	Ina jin tsoro.
And do some more.	Kuma yi wasu ƙarin.
Don't start me.	Kar a fara ni.
They know each other very well.	Sun san juna sosai.
Outside she stood.	A waje ta tsaya.
But maybe so too.	Amma watakila haka ma.
Why could she not work? 	Me ya sa ta kasa yin aiki?
She was surprised.	Ta yi mamaki.
Keep doing what you do.	Ci gaba da yin abin da kuke yi.
Get out of the house.	Fita daga gidan.
We need to take you somewhere.	Muna bukatar mu kai ku wani wuri.
He will be there.	Zai kasance a can.
Now is the time to act.	Yanzu ne lokacin yin aiki.
Komai.	Komai.
Not a game.	Ba wani wasa ba.
Are you reading this or not?	Kuna karanta wannan ko ba haka ba?
Right forward, right from above.	Dama gaba, dama daga sama.
They have been that way for a long time.	Sun dade a haka.
But we.	Amma mu .
I am not telling you what you are.	Ba ina gaya muku menene ku ba.
Let's stand outside.	Mu tsaya waje.
I hope you understand things.	Ina fatan ku gane abubuwa.
I'm sure they understood that.	Na tabbata sun fahimci hakan.
I don't like the man, he doesn't like me either.	Ba na son mutumin, shi ma bai so ni ba.
They do not talk much.	Ba su da yawa magana.
Please go after dinner.	Da fatan za a je bayan cin abinci.
Then.	Daga baya.
The first thing that comes to mind is food.	Abin da ya fara zuwa hankali shine abinci.
Will he come to your house.	Shin zai zo gidan ku.
So, it is one of the great developments.	Don haka, yana daga cikin babban ci gaba.
But no one really knows how to get there.	Amma ba wanda ya san yadda za a kai shi wurin.
They brought me back.	Suka dawo da ni.
Or love each other.	Ko son juna.
But this is not right.	Amma wannan ba daidai ba ne.
I'm not sure yet.	Ban tabbata ba tukuna.
But that is not fair.	Amma hakan bai dace ba.
I will give him this, and this,	Zan ba shi wannan, wannan kuma,
It is difficult for me to answer.	Amsa hakan ke da wuya na.
We don't think so.	Ba ma tunanin haka.
They could not do anything.	Ba su iya yin komai ba.
Continue your day and whatever happens, happens.	Ci gaba da ranar ku kuma duk abin da ya faru, ya faru.
Do not touch this or you will be injured.	Kada ku taɓa wannan ko za ku ji rauni.
She wants no one to lose her job.	Tana son kada kowa ya rasa aiki.
I do not want to be alone.	Ba na son zama ni kaɗai.
I can't describe it correctly.	Ba zan iya bayyana shi daidai ba.
Some children like to be alone.	Wasu yara suna son zama su kaɗai.
You want to keep it all at home.	Kuna so ku ajiye duka a gida.
Wait, everyone, do not rejoice.	Jira, kowa da kowa, kada ku yi farin ciki.
We have all seen it happen.	Mu duka mun ga yadda abin yake.
Decide what to eat for dinner.	Yanke shawarar abin da za ku ci don abincin dare.
He would never do that.	Ba zai taba yin haka ba.
You can not live without it.	Ba za ku iya yin rayuwa da shi ba.
I was completely out of my mind.	Gaba daya na fita daga cikin nawa.
The wise man began to speak.	Mai hankali ya fara magana.
This is nothing.	Wannan ba komai.
Not so today.	Ba haka ba a yau.
I will continue it.	Zan sake ci gaba da shi.
These are tools.	Waɗannan kayan aikin ne.
They died one by one.	Sai daya bayan daya suka mutu.
I understand why so many people reach this point.	Na fahimci dalilin da ya sa mutane da yawa suka isa ga wannan.
There is much truth in this statement.	Akwai gaskiya da yawa a cikin wannan magana.
There is no one behind.	Babu kowa a baya.
I fixed this once before really easily, but I forgot how.	Na gyara wannan sau ɗaya kafin da gaske cikin sauƙi, amma na manta yadda.
He doesn't seem to be drinking anything out of the water.	Da alama baya shan komai daga cikin ruwan.
Everything is as it should be.	Komai daidai yake kamar yadda yake.
Suddenly everything appeared.	Nan da nan komai ya bayyana.
But it is not.	Amma ba ita ba.
People are trying harder there.	Mutane suna ƙara ƙoƙari a can.
She said she thought she could.	Ta fada tana tunanin zata iya.
It should be an exciting time !.	Ya kamata ya zama lokaci mai ban sha'awa!.
The day, they are still talking about the big game.	Ranar, har yanzu suna magana game da babban wasan.
It is up to you.	Shi ne kan ku.
It may take some time before it returns to you.	Yana iya ɗaukar lokaci kafin ya dawo gare ku.
I didn't feel comfortable, she said.	Ban ji dadi ba, in ji ta.
It is very intelligent.	Yana da hankali sosai.
She was the one who thought.	Da ita ce ta yi tunani.
Call us now !.	Kira mu yanzu!.
Everything is as it should be.	Komai yana yadda ya kamata.
And one has to spend money to make money.	Kuma dole ne mutum ya kashe kudi don samun kudi.
No one coming or going.	Babu mai zuwa ko tafiya.
Not too cold.	Ba sanyi sosai.
He was devastated.	Ya bata rai.
Then three women.	Sai kuma mata uku.
That's what she wants.	Abin da take so kenan.
Now, that still works today.	Yanzu, wannan har yanzu yana aiki a yau.
There is no rain to reach no water.	Babu ruwan sama da zai kai babu ruwa.
Years of work in the workplace.	Shekaru na aiki a wurin aiki.
Until the right time food appears.	Har zuwa daidai lokacin abinci ya bayyana.
But not much.	Amma ba da yawa ba.
Others more often in the future.	Wasu kuma sau da yawa a gaba.
Then she disappeared into the world no.	Sai ta bata a duniya a'a.
Please make sure you don't let them do this to me.	Don Allah ka tabbata ba za ka bar su su yi min haka ba.
I want people to love me.	Ina son mutane su so ni.
No, no, no.	A'a, babu, babu.
I want the truth to come out '.	Ina son gaskiya ta fito'.
He thought of all the things he should say.	Ya yi tunanin duk abubuwan da ya kamata ya ce.
This has been going on for years.	Ana yin haka tsawon shekaru.
We must make sure that does not happen.	Dole ne mu tabbatar da hakan bai faru ba.
And no one has talked about the past.	Kuma babu wanda ya yi magana game da abubuwan da suka gabata.
I know you are faster than I am.	Na san kun fi ni sauri.
This is correct.	Wannan daidai ne.
You honestly ask me.	Kai gaskiya ka tambaye ni.
Fortunately there are such people in the world !.	Abin farin ciki akwai mutane irin wannan a duniya!.
Nothing will change.	Babu wani abu da zai canza.
Do this in any way you can.	Yi wannan ta kowace hanya da ke jin daɗi.
This can apply to any job or activity.	Wannan na iya amfani da kowane aiki ko aiki.
Maybe every day it will hurt.	Wataƙila kowace rana za ta yi rauni.
As you know.	Kamar yadda kuka sani.
I slept with her to love you.	Na kwana da ita don son ka.
That must change.	Dole ne hakan ya canza.
It's up to us.	Yana kan mu.
I don’t know who it is and it could be.	Ban san ko wane ne kuma zai iya zama ba.
Everything started to feel a little weird.	Komai ya fara jin komai kadan.
She was funny.	Ta kasance mai ban dariya.
I can take a server.	Zan iya ɗaukar ɗan saba.
And they can be the best.	Kuma za su iya zama mafi kyau.
He spoke to others of his kind.	Ya yi magana da wasu irin sa.
I want to fix it.	Ina so in gyara shi.
People tell me that.	Mutane suna gaya mani haka.
We need.	Muna bukata.
But in reality it was.	Amma a gaskiya ya kasance.
She lives alone.	Zaune take ita kadai.
Lots of things here.	Abubuwa da yawa a nan.
We do not know if he can continue this.	Ba mu sani ba ko zai iya ci gaba da wannan.
With so much unemployment, it is hard to find a job.	Tare da yawan rashin aikin yi, yana da wuya a sami aiki.
I want more than anything to leave here.	Ina so fiye da komai in bar nan.
Not much, really.	Ba yawa, da gaske.
These products are not easy to find.	Waɗannan kayan ba su da sauƙi a samu.
But it can be anything.	Amma yana iya zama komai.
Or the way as others have done.	Ko kuma hanyar kamar yadda wasu suka yi.
I want to make sure everything is right.	Ina so in tabbatar da cewa komai yayi daidai.
Their work is very difficult.	Aikin su yana da matukar wahala.
Prepared for use.	An shirya don amfani.
Maybe a little bit.	Wataƙila kaɗan kaɗan.
Now he knows.	Yanzu ya sani.
She spoke well	Ta fad'a da kyau
They need more work from us than that.	Suna buƙatar ƙarin aiki daga gare mu fiye da haka.
Now, this is a good movie.	Yanzu, wannan fim ne mai kyau.
This person is not very well.	Wannan mutumin ba shi da lafiya sosai.
And he is someone else's doctor.	Kuma shi likitan wani ne.
He did not show any surprise.	Bai nuna mamaki ba.
But not life.	Amma ba rai ba.
You just know that.	Ka san wannan kawai.
I was just thinking.	Tunani nake kawai.
I want it out.	Ina son ya fita.
Take care of the time.	Kula da lokacin.
I think to be.	Ina tunanin zama .
What do you feel.	Me kuke ji.
We decided that we should try to do them.	Mun yanke shawarar cewa ya kamata mu gwada yin su.
Nor were we temporary.	Haka kuma ba mu kasance na ɗan lokaci ba.
This is a good thing.	Wannan abu ne mai kyau.
I know it can not be easy.	Na san ba zai iya zama da sauƙi ba.
I would not be surprised.	Ba zan yi mamaki ba.
I hope you will hear things you have never heard before.	Ina fatan za ku ji abubuwan da ba ku taɓa ji ba.
He just stopped smoking.	Kawai ya daina shan taba.
You have everything.	Kuna da komai.
We must be told.	Dole ne a gaya mana.
Not really in a bad way.	Ba sosai a cikin mummunan hanya.
To fix this.	Don gyara wannan.
So it was.	Haka ta kasance.
But she wanted to say one thing.	Amma ta so ta ce abu daya.
You become one with the fight.	Kun zama daya tare da fada.
It didn’t work, nothing worked.	Bai yi aiki ba, babu abin da ya yi aiki.
I didn't want to kill him.	Ban so in kashe shi ba.
She explained to him that it was not so.	Ta bayyana masa cewa ba haka bane.
Of course this is a bad idea.	Tabbas wannan mummunan tunani ne.
You may miss how happy you are.	Za a iya rasa yadda za ku yi farin ciki.
It is raining heavily.	Ana ruwan sama sosai.
You can be very prepared.	Kuna iya shirya sosai.
But he could not be more honest.	Amma ba zai iya nuna gaskiya da gaske ba.
They can do that.	Za su iya yin hakan.
He feels good about today.	Ya ji dadi game da yau.
You can sleep at night.	Kuna iya barci da dare.
Obviously something more is expected of her.	Babu shakka ana tsammanin wani abu fiye da ita.
But she.	Amma ta .
They are beautiful.	Suna da kyau.
She wants everyone to like it.	Tana son kowa ya so shi.
Everyone was happy.	Kowa ya yi farin ciki.
This time is not like today.	Wannan lokacin ba kamar yau yake ba.
I left the room.	Na fita daga dakin.
It is difficult to know who heard what.	Yana da wuya a gane wanda ya ji me.
This is a busy time for me.	Wannan lokacin aiki ne a gare ni.
Please fix this.	Da fatan za a gyara wannan.
And it did for a while.	Kuma ya yi na ɗan lokaci.
Leave it overnight.	Bar shi dare.
Everyone thought they knew me.	Kowa ya dauka sun san ni.
It’s one of those things that looks the other way.	Yana daga cikin abin da ke kallon wata hanya.
This obviously happened many years ago.	Wannan ya bayyana ya faru shekaru da yawa da suka wuce.
It needs these things.	Yana buƙatar waɗannan abubuwan.
I will be back tomorrow.	Zan dawo gobe.
After all, it would be a good time.	Bayan haka, zai zama lokaci mai kyau.
But what they can give me will be more time.	Amma abin da za su iya ba ni zai zama ƙarin lokaci.
You should know this.	Ya kamata ku san wannan.
She wanted to accept it so much.	Ta so ta yarda da shi sosai.
But curiosity takes over.	Amma son sani yana ɗauka.
Dinner is prepared.	Abincin dare aka shirya.
You have to be amazing.	Dole ne ku zama mai ban mamaki.
You do your job and leave us everything.	Kuna yin aikin ku kuma ku bar mana komai.
It is a time when we feel we can do everything.	Lokaci ne da muka ji za mu iya yin komai.
We know what you did.	Mun san abin da kuka yi.
But it does not have to be this way.	Amma bai kamata ya kasance haka ba.
I think this is correct.	Ina tsammanin wannan ya zama daidai.
On the way someone gave it to him.	A hanya wani mutum ya ba shi.
You heard from him.	Kun ji daga gare shi.
We know they have no case.	Mun san ba su da wata kara.
He will take care of someone in the past.	Zai kula da wani a baya.
There is no way to make money.	Babu hanyar samun kuɗi.
What happened was wrong.	Abin da ya faru ba shi da kyau.
And that is what went on.	Kuma shi ne abin da ya ci gaba.
I find it difficult.	Ina samun shi da wuya.
I am the problem.	Ni ne matsalar.
It's too big.	Yana da girma da yawa.
The news changed her mind, and she returned home.	Labarin ya canza mata hankali, ta koma gida.
You are beautiful.	Kuna da kyau.
Let me do that.	Bari in yi haka.
It's too late now.	Ya makara don haka yanzu.
No one laughed.	Ba wanda yayi dariya.
He’s about to get it.	Yana kusa samun shi.
This person is not in the room.	Wannan mutumin ba ya cikin dakin.
They are all convinced.	Duk sun tabbata.
They have been safe there for years.	Sun kasance lafiya a can tsawon shekaru.
Please come.	Don Allah za ku zo.
Yet nothing will happen at home.	Amma duk da haka babu wani abu da zai faru a gida.
First here.	Na farko a nan.
We do not have much time.	Ba mu da lokaci mai yawa.
They have no hearing.	Ba su da ji.
Get out safely.	Fita gida lafiya.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
He said something, but she could not hear.	Ya ce wani abu, amma ta kasa ji.
I have a beautiful view.	Ina da kyakkyawan gani.
I like it the best by the way, right?	Ina son shi mafi kyau ta hanya, ko ba haka ba?.
The reason for this is as follows.	Dalilin haka shi ne kamar haka.
He felt a little wrong.	Ya ji kadan ba daidai ba.
You can pay easily.	Kuna iya biya a cikin sauƙi.
They told him to get up.	Suka ce masa ya tashi.
Even without a dog.	Ko da ba tare da kare ba.
Next to it.	Kusa da ita.
Come back to me.	Dawo da ni.
I never thought he would commit suicide.	Ban taba tunanin zai kashe kansa ba.
Amazing on the road.	Abin ban mamaki a hanya.
Others seem to have experienced this too.	Wasu kuma kamar sun sami wannan ma.
Ko a.	Ko a.
No problem.	Babu wata matsala.
Everything went well.	Komai ya tafi daidai.
No one came except her.	Ba wanda ya zo sai ita.
The work is exciting.	Aikin yana da ban sha'awa.
I will go with you if you wish.	Zan tafi tare da ku idan kuna so.
We want to give them the tools.	Muna so mu ba su kayan aikin.
She can't do it right, but she's trying.	Ba za ta iya yi daidai ba, amma tana ƙoƙari.
It is very interesting, he wrote.	Yana da ban sha'awa sosai, ya rubuta.
Maybe, it seems, is right.	Wataƙila, da alama, daidai ne.
I can't explain it all right now.	Ba zan iya bayyana shi duka ba a yanzu.
I think there are two things.	Ina tsammanin akwai abubuwa guda biyu.
Not surprisingly.	Ba abin mamaki bane.
We bought this beautiful new home.	Mun sayi wannan kyakkyawan sabon gida.
I still haven't.	Har yanzu ban yi ba.
One can make a good decision.	Mutum zai iya yanke shawarar da kyau.
She's familiar, somehow.	Ta saba, ko ta yaya.
He was not arrested.	Ba a kama shi ba.
And she was right.	Kuma ta yi gaskiya.
It happens completely outside of our knowledge.	Yana faruwa gaba daya a waje da sanin mu.
It feels comfortable in the hand.	Yana jin daɗi a hannu.
Do not try to say no.	Kada ku yi ƙoƙari ku ce ba za ku yi ba.
They are not used to it.	Ba su saba da shi ba.
But they do not want that.	Amma ba haka suke so ba.
This is real life.	Wannan ita ce rayuwa ta gaske.
Never try to catch him.	Kar a taɓa gwada kama shi.
We show you this.	Mun nuna muku wannan.
Everything is taken care of.	Da gaske an kula da komai.
We do not understand how anyone can do something like this.	Ba mu fahimci yadda wani zai iya yin wani abu kamar wannan ba.
You see.	Kuna gani.
Every little bit.	Kowane ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Store until very cold.	Ajiye har sai da sanyi sosai.
They have not met in a few years.	Ba su hadu a cikin 'yan shekaru ba.
He is not afraid.	Ba ya jin tsoro.
Children must be seen and not heard.	Dole ne a ga yara kuma ba a ji ba.
Hurry up.	Yi sauri.
We just can’t agree.	Ba za mu iya yarda kawai ba.
And nothing has changed.	Kuma babu abin da ya canza.
One day though.	Wata rana ko.
Girls should be in the world, doing what children do.	Ya kamata 'yan mata su kasance a cikin duniya, suna yin abin da yara suke yi.
If so, we're done.	Idan haka ne, mun gama.
You must be wondering why.	Dole ne ku yi mamakin dalilin.
And that is exactly what should be kept in mind here.	Kuma wannan shine ainihin abin da ya kamata a tuna a nan.
You are full of surprise.	Kun cika da mamaki.
I proved it was wrong.	Na tabbatar da hakan ba daidai ba ne.
No more time.	Babu sauran lokaci.
This is a lie.	Wannan karya ce.
I understand everyone is tired.	Na fahimci kowa ya gaji.
There is no doubt about that look.	Babu shakka game da wannan kallon.
I called him, he did not answer.	Na kira shi, bai amsa ba.
After all, it would be and is not true.	Bayan haka, zai zama kuma ba gaskiya bane.
It's not much.	Ba shi da yawa.
That's right.	Haka ya kamata.
We are glad you got the job.	Mun yi farin ciki da ka sami aiki.
Wait for the train.	Jira jirgin kasa.
And another man came forward a little later.	Kuma wani mutum ya zo gaba kadan daga baya.
Not necessarily.	Ba lallai ba ne.
However, she also showed something interesting.	Duk da haka, ta ma nuna wani abu mai ban sha'awa.
Delicious food was served daily.	An ba da abinci mai ban sha'awa kowace rana.
We did what we could only.	Mun yi abin da za mu iya kawai.
He will bring her back.	Zai dawo da ita.
For them, the game makes money.	A gare su, wasan yana samun kuɗi.
Good thing, by the way.	Abu mai kyau, ta hanya.
And that's what fascinated me.	Kuma abin da ya bani sha'awa ke nan.
I bought this book.	Na sayi wannan littafin.
Just give these people a chance!	Kawai a ba wa waɗannan mutane dama!
He can't just run.	Ba zai iya gudu kawai ba.
We must make sure we never leave a mark.	Dole ne mu tabbatar ba mu taɓa barin wata alama ba.
Do not leave your door open.	Kar a bar kofar gidan ku a bude.
Something was killed.	An kashe wani abu.
Do it or not.	Kuna yi ko ba ku yi ba.
This article was made.	An yi wannan labarin.
But it was time to move on.	Amma lokaci ya yi da zai tafi.
I think that will help us.	Ina tsammanin da zai taimake mu.
The cause is still unknown, though.	Har yanzu ba a fahimci dalilin ba, ko da yake.
No child did not eat.	Babu yaro da bai ci abinci ba.
I feel yes but.	Ina jin a amma.
I have girls	Ina da 'yan mata
I do not know where this happiness came from.	Ban san daga ina wannan farin cikin ya fito ba.
It feels very good.	Yana da matukar kyau ji.
I went back and got ready.	Na koma na shirya.
I went to talk to him.	Na je yi masa magana.
I can’t help but wonder why.	Ba zan iya yin mamakin dalilin ba.
Watch them do it.	Kallon su yayi.
It will be.	Zai kasance.
We know each other very well.	Mun san juna sosai.
This will help us to be more successful in life.	Wannan zai taimaka mana mu ƙara samun nasara a rayuwa.
I'm in a trance.	Ina cikin babban tunani.
I started to get involved.	Na fara shiga ciki.
As usual, after work.	Kamar yadda kuka saba, bayan yin aiki.
And he didn’t call me.	Kuma bai kira ni ba.
The man is said to be in poor health.	An ce mutumin ba shi da lafiya.
Otherwise it is not so.	In ba haka ba ba haka ba ne.
And you want to be so.	Kuma kuna son zama haka.
Near him, nothing grew.	A kusa da shi, babu abin da ya girma.
Wow, you didn’t and it was wrong.	Kai, ba ka yi ba kuma ba daidai ba ne.
It was a good time.	Lokaci ne mai kyau.
She will show us when she comes here.	Za ta nuna mana idan ta zo nan.
This puts you behind for a while.	Wannan yana sa ku bayan ɗan lokaci.
She said she could do without them.	Ta ce za ta iya yin ba tare da su ba.
But there are others, you know.	Amma akwai kuma wasu, ka sani.
Are you married.	Ka yi aure.
I think this is a good thing.	Ina ganin wannan abu ne mai kyau.
He had met her once before.	Sau daya ne ya hadu da ita a baya.
It would be better if we did not tell anyone.	Zai fi kyau idan ba mu gaya wa kowa ba.
I like that they travel by plane.	Ina son cewa suna tafiya ta jirgin sama.
I can get a job, if needed.	Zan iya samun aiki, idan akwai bukata.
Maybe a little bit.	Wataƙila kaɗan kaɗan.
But he will do more.	Amma zai kara yin hakan.
Be careful in the future.	Yi hankali a gaba.
Some things are off.	Wasu abubuwa sun kashe.
I can imagine what you are up to.	Zan iya tunanin abin da kuke ciki.
She must do it.	Dole ne ta yi.
This work did the right thing.	Wannan aikin ya yi daidai.
Do not raise the issue unnecessarily.	Kar a ta da matsala ba dole ba.
The food is good.	Abinci yayi kyau.
I would highly recommend the house.	Zan ba da shawarar gida sosai.
We do not want to lose sight of what to do with it.	Ba mu so mu rasa abin yi da shi.
And maybe it's true.	Kuma watakila gaskiya ne.
Truth is not the same thing.	Gaskiya ba abu ɗaya ba ce.
He was happy to tell me.	Ya yi farin ciki ya gaya mani.
Something else went wrong.	Wani abu kuma yayi kuskure.
They have been removed.	An cire su.
And he probably needs help.	Kuma tabbas yana bukatar taimako.
About how he wanted to die.	Game da yadda ya so ya mutu.
She closed the book.	Ta rufe littafin.
You can't do that now.	Ba za ku iya yin hakan ba yanzu.
Sorry but it's true.	Yi hakuri amma gaskiya ce.
The quest for worldly life continues.	Ana ci gaba da neman rayuwa ta duniya.
Therefore, he gave them others.	Saboda haka, ya ba su wasu.
Even when it does happen it doesn't.	Ko a lokacin da abin yake faruwa ba haka yake faruwa ba.
He does not live.	Ba ya rayuwa.
Don't take it.	Ba da ɗauka.
I don't know what brought him here.	Ban san me ya kawo shi ba.
I'm just waiting.	Ina jira kawai.
It doesn't matter until they come back.	Ba komai sai sun dawo.
Same with this.	Haka da wannan.
He did something.	Ya yi wani abu.
It doesn't hurt very much.	Bai yi zafi sosai ba.
And sometimes, even that is not enough.	Kuma wani lokacin, ko da hakan bai isa ba.
Then I wrote the answer.	Sai na rubuta amsa.
We almost.	Mun kusan .
I don't care about anyone.	Ban damu da mutum ba.
More than a year of this is enough.	Fiye da shekara guda na wannan ya isa.
It will not work.	Ba zai yi aiki ba.
I will not stay here alone.	Ba zan zauna a nan ni kaɗai ba.
Very nice, he thought.	Yayi kyau sosai, yayi tunani.
But there are things we know better than that.	Amma akwai abubuwan da muka sani fiye da su.
I feel now.	Ina jin yanzu.
She would not want it to be that way.	Ba za ta so ya kasance haka ba.
I am here to tell you to get ready.	Na zo nan ne in gaya muku ku shirya.
You can imagine the problem.	Kuna iya tunanin matsalar.
It is difficult to explain.	Yana da wuya a bayyana.
You just saved it.	Kun ajiye shi kawai.
You can see the kids at school.	Kuna iya ganin yara a makaranta.
Enough.	Ya isa.
The next one will be interesting.	Wanda zai zo na gaba zai zama mai ban sha'awa.
They didn’t give me a job.	Ba su ba ni aiki ba.
I like everything about it.	Ina son komai game da shi.
They all do the same.	Duk suna yin irin wannan.
There is no place for that in the story above.	Babu wurin hakan a cikin labarin da ke sama.
It was easy.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi.
Call ji.	Kira ji.
It will not be an easy task.	Ba zai zama aiki mai sauƙi ba.
But they were great about it.	Amma sun kasance masu girma game da shi.
He himself was not interested in that.	Shi da kansa ba shi da sha'awar hakan.
This correction, however, is almost impossible.	Wannan gyara, duk da haka, kusan kusan.
That's the way life is now.	Haka rayuwa take a yanzu.
He was, however, seemingly.	Ya kasance, duk da haka, alama.
Nothing was done.	Ba a yi komai ba.
This is really a weakness.	Da gaske wannan mai rauni ne.
And you probably won't be around in two years.	Kuma watakila ba za ku kasance a kusa da ku ba a cikin shekaru biyu.
She was smart too.	Ta kasance mai hankali kuma .
Now we know they do.	Yanzu mun san suna yi.
I have traveled more than ever.	Na kara tafiya fiye da da.
This house is huge.	Wannan gidan yana da girma.
Great and scary.	Mai girma da tsoro.
And not much thought.	Kuma ba a yi tunani da yawa ba.
He drives slowly.	Yana tuƙi a hankali.
Of course this will not be the last.	Tabbas wannan ba zai zama na ƙarshe ba.
But that seems to be the case.	Amma da alama abin da ya faru ke nan.
Apart from that, it is very good.	Baya ga wannan, yana da kyau sosai.
What’s growing in me.	Abin da ke girma a kaina.
Let's work on that.	Bari mu yi aiki da wannan.
This is not how to do it.	Wannan ba yadda za a yi ba.
Let me try.	Bari in gwada.
That should not be taken lightly.	Hakan ba za a yi shi cikin sauƙi ba.
It is cold in this room.	Sanyi yayi a dakin nan.
That they would not miss.	Da ba za su rasa ba.
Honestly we do.	Gaskiya muna yi.
The house is empty.	Gidan babu kowa.
You need to do this one by one.	Kuna buƙatar yin wannan ɗaya bayan ɗaya.
Maybe nothing.	Wataƙila ba komai.
You are making a big mistake!	Kuna yin babban kuskure!
Which is why.	Wanda shine dalilin haka.
I didn’t think anything of continuing.	Ban yi tunanin komai ba na ci gaba.
I wouldn’t mind otherwise.	Ban damu ba idan ba haka ba.
Do not believe what people tell you.	Kada ku yarda da abin da mutane ke gaya muku.
I don't even want to think about it.	Bata ma son tunanin hakan ba.
I can see where this is going.	Ina iya ganin inda wannan ke tafiya.
It's not just weakness right now.	Ba kawai rauni bane a yanzu.
Surprisingly no one ran.	Abin mamaki ba wanda aka gudu.
Maybe we should talk again at some point.	Wataƙila ya kamata mu sake yin magana a wani lokaci.
It should not have happened.	Bai kamata ya faru ba.
It is a decision he will make.	Yana da shawarar da zai yanke.
But it can’t be easy.	Amma ba zai iya zama da sauƙi ba.
It's a little sweet.	Ya dan yi dadi.
He got up.	Ya tashi.
We must admit that this is.	Dole ne mu yarda cewa wannan shi ne.
There is no sun.	Babu rana.
She said nothing and did not answer.	Bata ce komai ba ta amsa.
If you will, of course.	Idan kuna so, ba shakka.
Express yourself.	Bayyana kanku.
This is what we become.	Wannan shi ne abin da muka zama.
Rain.	Ruwan sama .
Prove it well.	Ka tabbatar da shi sosai.
You have to do something yourself.	Dole ne ku yi wani abu da kanku.
Another died.	Wani kuma ya mutu.
Otherwise you will never be able to see.	In ba haka ba ba za ku taba iya gani ba.
I realized that too at the time.	Ni ma na gane hakan a lokacin.
Stop for everything.	Tsaya don komai.
I don't remember it.	Bata tuna shi ba.
Let someone play.	Bari wani yayi wasa.
No wonder they are so beautiful.	Ba abin mamaki ba ne cewa suna da kyau.
I tested it myself.	Na gwada da kaina.
We need to go further.	Yakamata mu kara tafiya.
As far as it goes.	Har zuwa shi.
We know where every day is at all times.	Mun san inda kowace rana a kowane lokaci.
Night does not come, it does not go.	Dare ba ya zuwa, ba ya tafiya.
She has not done so in years.	Ba ta yi hakan ba tsawon shekaru.
He says he does.	Yace yana yi.
We never did.	Ba mu taba yi ba.
Desire is not intelligent.	So ba na hankali ba ne.
He almost killed me, somehow.	Ya kusa kashe ni, ko ta yaya.
Sometimes, it's like two people.	Wani lokaci, kamar mutum biyu ne.
I do not.	Ba ina yi ba.
They found nothing.	Ba su sami komai ba.
Enough for now.	Ya isa na yanzu.
This, too, is wrong.	Wannan ma, bai yi daidai ba.
I did not wait.	Ban jira ba.
I grew up	Na girma
You better know him.	Gara ku san shi.
I remember very well.	Na tuna da kyau.
You can feel everything.	Kuna iya jin komai.
She seems to know a lot about him.	Da alama ta san da yawa game da shi.
First we assume.	Da farko muna ɗauka.
For them, things are going well.	A gare su, abubuwa suna tafiya da kyau.
Dan interesting.	Dan ban sha'awa.
The train has passed.	Jirgin ya wuce.
He seemed interested, though he didn't say much.	Ya yi kamar yana sha'awar, ko da yake bai ce da yawa ba.
Kill you he said.	Kashe ku sai ya ce.
We could not go fast.	Ba mu iya tafiya da sauri ba.
She is tired.	Ta gaji.
It was never necessary.	Bai taba zama dole ba.
He will change things, if he ever does.	Zai canza abubuwa, idan ya taɓa yin hakan.
It's really nice.	Yana da kyau gaske.
She just said she was tired.	Sai kawai ta ce ta gaji.
Absolutely.	Lallai.
Not right.	Ba dama ba.
She goes on to say don't worry.	Ta ci gaba da cewa kada ka damu.
But that protects you.	Amma hakan ya kare ku.
Every song is beautiful.	Kowane waƙa yana da kyau.
But insomnia has never killed anyone.	Amma rashin barci bai taba kashe kowa ba.
But it really helped me.	Amma da gaske ya taimake ni.
And it's good.	Kuma yana da kyau.
We are missing something.	Muna rasa wani abu.
If you do not know.	Idan ba ku sani ba.
Or maybe not.	Ko watakila ba haka ba ne.
I will work tonight.	Zan yi aiki a daren yau.
The children began to run.	Yara sun fara gudu.
I'm just saying.	Ina cewa kawai.
That has already happened.	Hakan ya riga ya faru.
Whatever we want.	Duk abin da muke so.
I just found it a little funny.	Na ɗan sami ɗan ban dariya sosai.
You will give a lot of things.	Za ku ba da abubuwa da yawa.
Everything he writes is yours.	Duk abin da ya rubuta na ku ne.
But it was a wonderful time.	Amma lokaci ne mai ban mamaki.
I’ve never seen any of this in person, though.	Ban taba ganin wani daga cikin wannan a cikin mutum ba, ko da yake.
They can do whatever they want.	Za su iya yin duk abin da suke so.
You learned that very well.	Kun koyi haka sosai.
These are the first heat.	Waɗannan su ne zafi na farko.
It's a good thing he doesn't have it.	Abu ne mai kyau ba shi da shi.
It can be very interesting.	Zai iya zama mai ban sha'awa sosai.
And take me with him.	Kuma kai ni da shi.
It was as it should be.	Ya zama kamar yadda ya kamata.
She remembers that it is always best to be honest.	Ta tuna cewa ya fi kyau a kasance da gaskiya koyaushe.
Did you work last night?	Kun yi aiki a daren jiya?
The book is amazing.	Littafin yana da ban mamaki.
Drink plenty of water.	Sha ruwa mai yawa.
They did and they almost broke me.	Sun yi kuma sun kusa karya ni.
Or when the time comes it will fly away.	Ko kuma idan lokacin ya yi zai tashi.
They feel more than helpful.	Suna jin fiye da taimako.
She made a big mistake.	Ta yi babban kuskure.
Put in any or get.	Saka cikin kowane ko kuma samu.
I'm not sure, but I could not come up with anything better.	Ban tabbata ba, amma ban iya fito da wani abu mafi kyau ba.
God made them all alive.	Allah ya sa duk suna da rai.
He often spoke without thinking.	Sau da yawa ya yi magana ba tare da tunani ba.
Let me tell you, you do.	Bari in gaya muku, kuna yi.
We will arrange time and place for that.	Za mu shirya lokaci da wuri don hakan.
The problem is money.	Matsalar ita ce kudi.
You two come with me.	Ku biyu ku zo tare da ni.
We can make some progress, though.	Za mu iya samun ɗan ci gaba, ko da yake.
This will not always be the case.	Wannan ba zai zama kamar kowane lokaci ba.
I have to be careful.	Dole ne in yi hankali.
I have to take the job.	Dole ne in dauki aikin.
See where he goes, what he does.	Kalli inda ya tafi, abin da yake yi.
He thought he didn't care.	Ya dauka bai damu ba.
Removed.	An cire shi.
Who will be the best?	Wanene zai fi kyau?
It's more than that.	Ya fi haka.
And you will not know.	Kuma ba za ku sani ba.
How to write "bus"?	Yaya ake rubuta "bas"?
She will wait until you are ready.	Za ta jira idan kun shirya.
But that does not always happen.	Amma hakan ba zai iya faruwa sau da yawa ba.
I tell you how it is here.	Ina gaya muku yadda abin yake a nan.
One day or another I did not tell her.	Ranar ko wata rana ban fada mata ba.
Just leave it at that.	Kawai ka bar shi.
You can have one, or you can't.	Kuna iya samun ɗaya, ko ba za ku iya ba.
That is what she should do.	Abin da ya kamata ta yi kenan.
I can decide that easily.	Zan iya yanke shawarar hakan cikin sauƙi.
Put myself outside.	Saka kaina waje.
I really enjoyed this movie.	Na ji daɗin wannan fim ɗin sosai.
I am so tired!	Na gaji sosai!
You know better than that.	Kun fi wannan sani.
He did not hear this.	Bai ji wannan ba.
And this book is about getting what you want.	Kuma wannan littafin yana game da samun abin da kuke so.
I'm calling	Ina kan kira
Of course you do.	Tabbas kuna yi.
Not much to say.	Ba a ce da yawa.
He took them home.	Ya kai su gida.
I will take care of you.	Zan kula da ku.
However, we cannot let it go.	Duk da haka, ba za mu iya barin shi ya tafi ba.
Let's live together.	Mu zauna tare.
In this room.	A cikin wannan dakin.
I just worked.	Na yi aiki kawai.
I love what they do with the place.	Ina son abin da suka yi da wurin.
The problem is.	Matsalar ita ce.
I laughed at her, at night.	Na yi mata dariya sosai, a daren.
Still, it's good, don't you think?	Har yanzu, yana da kyau, ba ku tunani?
And he did, sometimes.	Kuma ya yi, wani lokacin.
Whatever you can do, you help.	Duk abin da za ku iya yi, kun taimaka.
But there are opportunities.	Amma akwai dama.
There is one child, a child.	Akwai yaro daya, yaro.
Take mine.	Ka dauka nawa.
He is coming safely.	Yana zuwa lafiya.
Save for any use.	Ajiye don wani amfani.
For more money.	Don ƙarin kuɗi.
The outside is very cold.	A waje yayi sanyi sosai.
Three died, including two children.	Uku sun mutu, ciki har da yara biyu.
These are real things that happen to real people.	Waɗannan abubuwa ne na gaske da ke faruwa ga mutane na gaske.
But of course, you have never seen the future.	Amma ba shakka, ba ku taɓa ganin nan gaba ba.
She never did anything she didn't want to do.	Ba ta taba yin wani abu da ba ta son yi.
This is happening, right now.	Wannan yana faruwa, a yanzu.
She alleged that he had drunk.	Ta yi zargin cewa ya sha.
They know it.	Sun san shi.
On the way he stopped to drink water	A hanya ya tsaya ya sha ruwa
But maybe he's tired of playing.	Amma watakila ya gaji da wasa.
Wait for them.	Ku jira su.
That will continue to happen.	Hakan zai ci gaba da faruwa.
Everyone took one and gave it to him.	Kowane mutum ya ɗauki ɗaya ya ba da shi.
The rest did not run.	Sauran ba su gudu.
It was about life.	Ya kasance game da rayuwa.
She is not sure about the time.	Ba ta da tabbas game da lokacin.
I want you to leave this with me now.	Ina so ku bar wannan tare da ni yanzu.
Steel and steel.	Karfe da karfe.
This is true, it was not added later.	Wannan gaskiya ne, ba a ƙara shi daga baya ba.
In general.	Gaba ɗaya.
No, not close, not close, not close.	A'a, ba kusa, ba kusa, ba kusa ba.
I do not remember traveling anyone.	Ban tuna tafiya kowa ba.
Much is wrong.	Da yawa ba daidai ba ne.
Fear still lingers.	Har yanzu tsoro yana nan.
Come and live with me.	Ku zo ku zauna tare da ni.
I know you enjoy it.	Na san kuna jin daɗin hakan.
It is very difficult to say whether it was successful or not.	Yana da matukar wahala a ce an yi nasara ko a'a.
We didn't talk about it.	Ba mu yi magana a kai ba.
Tomorrow is my day.	Gobe ​​ne rana ta.
Hurry, or we are late to school!	Yi sauri, ko mu makara zuwa makaranta!
He should be back now.	Ya kamata ya dawo yanzu.
He could not continue.	Ba zai iya ci gaba da hakan ba.
Truth is not in doubt.	Gaskiya ba a cikin shakka.
We must take that decision.	Dole ne mu dauki wannan shawarar.
We will let him come back later.	Za mu bar shi ya dawo daga baya.
He did not agree.	Bai yarda ba.
They just need you to explain.	Suna buƙatar kawai ka bayyana.
This is like the thought of hope.	Wannan kamar tunanin fata ne.
Lots of money.	Kudi masu yawa.
This is only slightly seen.	Wannan kadan ne kawai aka gani.
This does not always happen.	Wannan ba koyaushe yake faruwa ba.
I know who he is.	Na san wanene shi.
They may go to the wrong house.	Suna iya zuwa gidan da bai dace ba.
It always works at night.	Kullum dare yake aiki.
Some were fat.	Wasu sun kasance mai.
But he still got involved.	Amma har yanzu ya shiga.
But this year, there was no rain.	Amma a bana, babu ruwan sama.
This is not the place.	Wannan ba wurin bane.
I arrived home.	Na isa gida.
I just focus.	Ina mai da hankali ne kawai.
It is not necessarily about the food itself.	Ba lallai ba ne game da abincin da kansa.
Remember, it was dinner time.	Ka tuna, lokacin abincin dare ne.
I did nothing.	Ban yi komai ba.
I can get.	zan iya samun .
We planned the project would take one day.	Mun shirya aikin zai dauki rana daya.
It just happens.	Abin da ke faruwa ne kawai.
The way they talk.	Da yadda suke magana.
We are put here to kill.	An sanya mu nan don mu kashe.
She should not have done this.	Bai kamata ta yi wannan ba.
He is still there.	Har yanzu yana can.
This house has been uninhabited for years.	Wannan gidan babu kowa a shekaru.
It is not true that we need this person.	Ba gaskiya ba ne cewa muna bukatar wannan mutumin.
How it is.	Yadda abin yake.
He can read now, slowly.	Ya iya karatu yanzu, a hankali.
How it should work.	Yadda yakamata yayi aiki.
This thing is difficult.	Wannan abu yana da wuya.
They were the closest.	Sun kasance mafi kusa.
I wondered what was going on.	Na yi mamakin me ke faruwa.
They say tomorrow we can have them.	Suka ce gobe za mu iya samun su.
This is.	Wannan shine.
They’re fast, they’re hot, and they can be anything.	Suna da sauri, suna da zafi, kuma suna iya zama wani abu.
I'm waiting for them to come back.	Ina jira su dawo.
You have your money.	Kuna da kuɗin ku.
It's difficult but we have to keep playing.	Abu ne mai wahala amma dole ne mu ci gaba da wasa.
He loves rain.	Yana son ruwan sama.
He saw what he should not have seen.	Ya ga abin da bai kamata ya gani ba.
He can give it to you immediately.	Zai iya ba ku nan da nan.
But he did not know what to do.	Amma bai san abin da zai yi ba.
Leave these beautiful women alone.	Ku bar waɗannan mata masu kyau su kaɗai.
Only three of them.	Uku kawai daga ciki.
Think about doing it.	Yi tunani game da yin shi.
It's too hot.	Yayi zafi sosai.
It was wrong and we knew what had happened.	Ba daidai ba ne kuma mun san abin da ya faru.
But it was never done.	Amma ba a taba yin sa ba.
The one in me.	Wanda ke cikin kaina.
He came back to her.	Ya dawo mata.
This has not been the case over the years.	Ba a yi haka ba a cikin shekaru.
The world does not work that way.	Duniya ba ta aiki haka.
You have to stay still.	Dole ne ku zauna har yanzu.
There is nothing ahead there.	Babu wani abu mai gaba a wurin.
We do not want to see this happen.	Ba ma son ganin hakan ta faru.
We never heard from him again.	Ba mu sake jin labarin ba.
You know nothing about it.	Ba ku san komai game da shi ba.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
I would never be able to do that.	Ba zan taba iya yin hakan ba.
Besides, he realized he wanted to tell someone what had happened.	Ban da haka, ya gane yana so ya gaya wa wani abin da ya faru.
We were really excited.	Mun kasance muna jin daɗi sosai.
I think of many things.	Ina tunanin abubuwa da yawa.
You need to pay attention to this wet road.	Kuna buƙatar yin hankali akan wannan rigar hanya.
It is not right to succeed.	Ba daidai ba ne a yi nasara.
Save these.	Ajiye waɗannan.
It has to happen.	Dole ta faru haka.
It got colder.	Ya kara yin sanyi.
The car started.	Mota ta fara.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
There is only fish.	Akwai kifi kifi kawai.
She said that again.	Ta sake cewa.
The decision was that she could not.	Shawarar ita ce ba za ta iya ba.
They say he committed suicide.	Suna cewa ya kashe kansa.
It was like that.	Ya zama kamar haka.
It's better now but he never saw this coming.	Ya fi kyau yanzu amma bai taba ganin wannan yana zuwa ba.

It was a wonderful day.	Rana ce mai ban mamaki.
We confirmed that last night.	Mun tabbatar da hakan a daren jiya.
Just finding a place to open is useful.	Kawai gano wani wuri da zai bude yana da amfani.
Nor do we need it.	Haka kuma ba ma bukata.
I enjoy walking and flying.	Ina jin daɗin tafiya da tashi.
If you look closely, you can tell.	Idan ka duba kusa, za ka iya fada.
Right until it is explained.	Dama har sai an bayyana.
The car is full.	Motar ta cika.
We stayed for a while.	Muka zauna na dan lokaci.
It tastes so good.	Yayi dadi sosai.
No one heard him.	Ba wanda ya ji shi.
Now it is true.	Yanzu yana gaskiya.
He almost killed her.	Ya kusa kashe ta.
I do not know where to start.	Ban san ta inda zan fara ba.
We all read it, many people read it.	Mu duka muna karanta shi, mutane da yawa suna karanta shi.
They can’t sit or do anything.	Ba za su iya zama ko yin wani abu ba.
And she is not alone.	Kuma ba ita kadai ba.
But please do not.	Amma don Allah kar a yi.
What's this? 	Menene wannan?
Will anyone bother to move on?	Shin wani zai damu ya ci gaba?
Without the help of the police, this would have been even more difficult.	Ba tare da taimakon 'yan sanda ba ya sa hakan ya fi wahala.
We have something amazing planned.	Muna da wani abu mai ban mamaki da aka shirya.
Few people are all the same or one way.	Mutane kaɗan ne duk hanya ɗaya ce ko ɗaya.
They are definitely beautiful.	Lallai suna da kyau.
Like, really, really.	Kamar, ainihin, ainihin.
I don't think that's fair.	Ina ganin wannan bai dace ba.
In real time, everyone fails.	A cikin ainihin lokacin, kowa ya kasa.
I want to do one more.	Ina so in yi daya kuma.
I know it's too late.	Na san ya makara.
Hardest for others.	Mafi wahala ga wasu.
It should be mine.	Ya kamata ya zama nawa.
No problem for smoking, but it is not suitable for the occasion.	Babu matsala don shan taba, amma bai dace da lokacin ba.
It's close by.	Yana kusa da nan.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
He seems to know everyone in the place where he will be known.	Da alama ya san kowa a wurin da za a san shi.
Eventually, however, that changed.	Daga ƙarshe, duk da haka, hakan ya canza.
She is here now.	Yanzu tana nan.
We use it for everything.	Muna amfani da shi don komai.
This guy is smart.	Wannan mutumin yana da hankali.
Why are so many people coming here?	Me yasa mutane da yawa ke zuwa nan?
I am fine with myself.	Ina lafiya da kaina.
He just thought he was smoking.	Ya dan yi tunani yana shan taba.
I used to print it there too.	Na kan buga shi a can ma.
He did so.	Ya yi haka.
And now they are three years old.	Kuma yanzu sun cika shekaru uku.
I am very happy with her because she is an amazing person.	Ina matukar farin ciki da ita don ita mutum ce mai ban mamaki.
He can't hear me.	Ba zai iya ji na ba.
If it is sold well, you will sell it.	Idan an sayar da shi sosai, za ku sayar da shi.
He changed her.	Ya canza mata.
He wrote the film that changes everything.	Ya rubuta fim ɗin da ke canza komai.
I passed and sat next to her.	Na wuce na zauna kusa da ita.
So we went out.	Haka muka fita.
I think it's good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau.
Maybe they made a mistake.	Wataƙila sun yi kuskure.
Doing so suffices on the ground.	Yayi haka ya isa a k'asa.
People are walking, some are coming.	Mutane suna tafiya, wasu suna zuwa.
Not once.	Ba ko sau daya ba.
For dog food.	Don abincin kare.
That they must do as they do.	Cewa dole ne su yi kamar yadda suka yi.
It's hard for me to remember.	Yana da wuya a gare ni in tuna.
When she heard this, she laughed.	Bayan ta ji haka sai ta yi dariya.
Maybe it works.	Wataƙila yana aiki.
And maybe he even died.	Kuma watakila ma ya mutu.
We got a little bit closed.	Mun samu rufe na dan kadan.
There are still too many.	Har yanzu akwai da yawa da yawa.
Swimming is provided.	An ba da iyo.
Life is full.	Rayuwa ta cika.
There is no way to help them.	Babu yadda za a taimake su.
Now, you can't say anything to anyone.	Yanzu, ba za ku ce wa kowa komai ba.
Surprisingly, you know.	Abin ban mamaki, kun sani.
We haven't made any corrections yet.	Ba mu yi gyara ba tukuna.
Can't just walk.	Ba za a iya tafiya kawai ba.
She does not feel well.	Bata jin lafiya.
The players we added were missing.	An yi rashin 'yan wasan da muka kara da su.
That explains why he didn’t call me.	Wannan ya bayyana dalilin da ya sa bai kira ni ba.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
I will not take the job.	Ba zan dauki aikin ba.
This is acceptable.	Wannan abin yarda ne.
Of course she can make mistakes.	Tabbas tana iya yin kuskure.
She also heard.	Ita ma ta ji.
You will be on your own after that.	Za ku kasance da kanku bayan haka.
But that must be difficult.	Amma hakan dole ne ya kasance da wuya.
I said somehow.	Na ce ko yaya.
She could not see anyone there.	Ba ta iya ganin kowa a can.
To my surprise, that's all.	Abin ya ba ni mamaki, shi ke nan.
This was to be expected.	Wannan ya kasance ana tsammanin.
She was given every opportunity.	An ba ta kowace dama.
If he catches you, he will kill you.	Idan ya kama ku, zai kashe ku.
So, fine, last thought.	Don haka, lafiya, tunani na ƙarshe.
Or pay somewhere else.	Ko biya wani waje.
I want to fly with you around me.	Ina so in tashi tare da ku kusa da ni.
I like what he does.	Ina son abin da yake yi.
Delightful to take.	Dadi don ɗauka.
You will get more work.	Za ku sami ƙarin aiki.
Either way you will get good food.	Ko ta yaya za ku sami abinci mai kyau.
Maybe he can't.	Wataƙila ba zai iya ba.
It will kill me, though.	Zai kashe ni, ko da yake.
It's just fun.	Abin sha'awa ne kawai.
So, everything is working fine.	Don haka, komai yana aiki lafiya.
I have to go back home.	Dole na koma cikin gida.
Only the second is used.	Ana amfani da na biyu kawai.
We know there must be a better way.	Mun san dole ne a sami hanya mafi kyau.
I am one of the users.	Ina ɗaya daga cikin masu amfani.
She writes.	Ta rubuta.
They were smart.	Sun kasance masu hankali.
It's very difficult.	Yana da wuya sosai.
Where did everyone go?	Ina kowa ya tafi?
I could not lie to her.	Na kasa yi mata karya.
We’re in this together, so let’s get to it !.	Muna cikin wannan tare, don haka mu isa gare shi!.
We do not need help.	Ba ma bukatar taimako.
He was amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
I looked up.	Na kalli sama.
Right in front.	Dama a gaba.
You do not need to get to school early.	Ba buƙatar ku isa makaranta da wuri ba.
They are also human.	Su ma mutane ne.
But two things have changed.	Amma abubuwa biyu sun canza.
Let us explain why.	Bari mu bayyana dalilin.
This decision is inappropriate.	Wannan shawarar bata dace ba.
Someone loves me out of the way.	Wani mai son ni daga hanya.
It doesn't always work very well.	Ba koyaushe yana aiki sosai ba.
If you do not agree with me, please read this.	Idan ba ku yarda da ni ba, don Allah ku karanta wannan.
This proves to be a big mistake.	Wannan ya tabbatar da babban kuskure ne.
So, go ahead.	Don haka, ci gaba.
I want to try to catch.	Ina so in gwada in kama.
This is a good thing.	Wannan abu ne mai kyau.
I kept walking.	Na ci gaba da tafiya.
It's scary.	Yana da ban tsoro.
I'm glad we won.	Na yi farin ciki da mun yi nasara.
The flight was good for me.	Tashi yayi min kyau.
None of this is necessary.	Babu wani daga cikin abin da ya zama dole.
One, two, many.	Daya, biyu, da yawa.
I like some.	Na so wasu.
Simplicity is often the best.	Sauƙi sau da yawa shine mafi kyau.
They say you need it, you say they can save it.	Suka ce kana bukata, ka ce za su iya ajiye shi.
She knows this now and in general.	Ta san haka a yanzu da gaba ɗaya.
Time changes everything and everyone.	Lokaci yana canza komai da kowa.
One should stick with their diet.	Ya kamata mutum ya tsaya tare da abincin su.
Such work is really needed.	Irin wannan aikin yana buƙatar gaske.
He was a human being.	Ya kasance mutum ne.
I like both.	Ina son duka biyu.
Whom you can talk to.	Wanda za ku iya magana da shi.
People have to go.	Dole ne mutane su tafi.
Of course it does not break it.	Tabbas ba ya karya shi.
No one is around.	Babu kowa a kusa.
But the problem is that we break it.	Amma matsalar ita ce mu karya shi.
Can't remember where it came from.	Bata iya tuna inda ya fito ba.
There is so much more than just driving.	Akwai da yawa fiye da tuƙi kawai.
They also used each other.	Sun kuma yi amfani da juna.
He knew he was coming.	Ya san yana zuwa.
Who is 'us'.	Wanene 'mu'.
But there is something else.	Amma akwai wani abu kuma.
Where we are.	Inda muke.
This is the whole way.	Wannan ita ce hanyar gaba ɗaya.
She used to talk to me about it.	Ta sha yi min magana game da shi.
They never have.	Ba su taba da.
This is the first time.	Wannan na farko ne.
We'll give it a go.	Za mu ba shi tafi.
It would be better if you were.	Zai fi kyau idan kai ne.
You will be fine.	Za ku kasance lafiya.
As it is now.	Kamar yadda yake a yanzu.
You can do a lot of real things with this moment.	Kuna iya yin abubuwa da yawa na gaske tare da wannan lokacin.
That is why she is here.	Shi yasa tana nan.
Both twice.	Duk sau biyu.
This is a good one.	Wannan shi ne mai kyau.
Where are they going to take him.	Ina za su kai shi.
Really good book.	Gaskiya mai kyau littafin.
Think of it this way.	Ka yi tunani a kai kamar haka.
Just what is needed.	Kawai abin da ake bukata.
But he got a great job right.	Amma ya sami babban aiki daidai.
And, how.	Kuma, ta yaya.
I want to continue my work.	Ina so in ci gaba da aiki na.
But the room is empty.	Amma dakin babu kowa.
He is a very intelligent man, you know.	Mutum ne mai hankali, ka sani.
They ask me things, they tell me things.	Suna tambaye ni abubuwa, suna gaya mani abubuwa.
Don't work like that.	Kada ku yi aiki haka nan.
I really want to go.	Ina matukar son tafiya.
That’s the thing, though.	Wannan shine abin, ko da yake.
It is not.	Ba shi da.
I don’t know who started it, really.	Ban san wanda ya fara ba, da gaske.
I really kind of.	Na gaske irin.
I have to think.	Dole ne in yi tunani.
Like, a good person.	Kamar, mutum mai kyau.
So let’s see where you take this.	Don haka bari mu ga inda kuke ɗaukar wannan.
Don't leave me here.	Kada ku bar ni a nan.
At this point it seems we don’t have that person.	A wannan lokacin da alama ba mu da wannan mutumin.
Either way, read the book.	Ko ta yaya, karanta littafin.
But they are not here.	Amma ba su nan.
Check and wait.	Duba kuma jira.
I was amazed like everyone else.	Ina mamakin kamar kowa.
And it annoyed him.	Kuma ya bata masa rai.
No maybe about it.	A'a watakila game da shi.
She is sitting on the floor.	Tana nan zaune a kasa.
I would recommend this trip to everyone.	Zan ba da shawarar wannan tafiya ga kowa da kowa.
It's a big house.	Babban gida ne.
I need you to protect me and love me and love me.	Ina bukata ka kare ni kuma ka so ni kuma ka so ni.
Prior to that, he was not involved in any of the riots.	Kafin wannan, bai shiga hannu sosai ba.
He never saw it change.	Bai taba ganin ya canza ba.
I have never seen anything less.	Ban taba ganin komai kasa ba.
Immediately it closed.	Nan take ya rufe.
He did not call anyone.	Bai kira kowa ba.
When food is not seen, it goes out slowly.	Lokacin da abinci ba ya gani, ya fita a hankali.
They enjoy talking a lot.	Suna jin daɗin magana da yawa.
So is the world.	Haka duniya take.
Show her.	Ka nuna mata.
It is not necessary.	Bai zama dole ba.
A good movie.	Fim mai daɗi.
This is your time.	Wannan shine lokacin ku.
Everything takes time.	Komai yana ɗaukar lokaci.
This is just fine.	Wannan yana da kyau kawai.
I drank nothing but water.	Na sha ruwa ba komai sai ruwa.
Yet they will not leave him.	Duk da haka ba za su bar shi ba.
I do not know how, but he took the money.	Ban san yadda ba, amma ya tafi da kuɗin.
We can certainly look at this as follows.	Lallai muna iya duba wannan kamar haka.
In fact, you do not need them.	A gaskiya ma, ba ku buƙatar su.
I will if you do.	Zan yi idan kun yi.
He has since returned.	Tun daga lokacin ya koma.
The second best time is now.	Lokaci mafi kyau na biyu shine yanzu.
I have never been here.	Na taba zama a nan.
But after that, the path must be explained.	Amma bayan haka, dole ne a bayyana hanyar.
I will watch the movie.	Zan kalli fim.
Slowly she waited.	A hankali ta jira.
It's not safe.	Ba lafiya.
We could not agree.	Ba mu iya yarda ba.
It’s totally amazing.	Abin mamaki ne gaba ɗaya.
It is well prepared.	An shirya sosai.
We are safe now.	Mun samu lafiya yanzu.
I love every moment of this.	Ina son kowane lokacin wannan.
Everyone told her.	Kowa ya fada mata.
Go there.	Can ku tafi.
You will not make much money doing this.	Ba za ku sami kuɗi da yawa yin wannan ba.
Another man joined them.	Wani mutum kuma ya shiga su.
Surely the heat will be something.	Lallai zafi zai kasance wani abu.
It showed nothing.	Bai nuna komai ba.
He can kill her and eat.	Yana iya kashe ta ya ci.
I'm not feeling well today.	Ba na jin dadi sosai a yau.
In the car.	A cikin motar.
Some women can.	Wasu mata za su iya.
It seems.	Da alama.
Indeed, they have often done so.	Lallai, sau da yawa sun yi haka.
Must be someone else.	Dole ne ya zama wani.
She was not 'dead' or 'killed', but 'she was dead'.	Ba 'ta mutu' ko 'an kashe' ba, amma 'ta mutu sosai'.
Smoking is bad, so stop.	Shan taba ba shi da lafiya, don haka ka daina.
Maybe they are cold and need my help.	Wataƙila sun yi sanyi kuma suna buƙatar taimako na.
Like you now.	Kamar ku a yanzu.
Many people have this problem.	Mutane da yawa suna da wannan matsalar.
The call of the world to come.	Kira na duniya zuwa.
How wonderful!	Yaya ban mamaki!
At the same time.	Lokaci guda yayi.
We should try to talk to them.	Ya kamata mu yi ƙoƙari mu yi magana da su.
Do not sit and work in one place.	Kada ku zauna ku yi aiki a wuri ɗaya.
Everything went well.	Komai ya tafi lafiya.
That made her thirteen.	Hakan yasa ta sha uku.
Not something like that.	Ba wani abu haka ba.
Sometimes, it works.	Wani lokaci, yana aiki.
You better love her.	Ka yi kyau ka so ta.
It came out of something scary.	Ya fito ne daga wani abu mai ban tsoro.
I feel you are a smart person.	Na ji kai mutum ne mai hankali.
I like that.	Ina son abin.
I would say no.	Zan ce a'a.
Come on, everyone.	Ku zo, kowa da kowa.
We say and we say very well.	Muna fada kuma muna fada sosai.
Write a song alone not everyone can.	Rubuta waƙa kadai ba kowa ba zai iya.
Now go over there.	Yanzu ku wuce can.
He printed one for the library.	Ya buga daya don dakin karatu.
We can't.	Ba za mu iya ba.
And, yes, it worked.	Kuma, a, ya yi aiki.
She is as beautiful as she is.	Tana da kyau kamar yadda take.
I don’t think of myself in that.	Ba na tunanin kaina a cikin wannan.
We started this project earlier than the others.	Mun fara wannan aikin a baya fiye da sauran.
I will do it myself.	Zan yi da kaina.
He was in the back, where he wanted to.	Ya kasance a baya, inda yake so.
So it was.	Don haka ya kasance.
You don't say that it's just a thought.	Ba ka ce haka ba tunani ne kawai.
No one does.	Babu wanda yake yi.
Call until you get an answer.	Kira har sai kun sami amsa.
I only have two and that was a short time.	Ina da biyu kawai kuma hakan ya kasance ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
That doesn't make it safe.	Wannan baya sanya shi lafiya.
I have never seen a person like anything.	Ban taba ganin mutum kamar komai ba.
We love it.	Muna son shi.
And that's what you went for.	Kuma abin da kuka je kenan.
I know exactly what to do.	Na san ainihin abin da zan yi.
It's a problem.	Matsalar ce.
There I am.	Akwai ni a can.
I'm dead, now.	Na mutu, yanzu.
Ill if he marries her.	Rashin lafiya idan ya aure ta.
Not in anything.	Ba a cikin wani abu ba.
You can do anything, there.	Kuna iya yin komai, a can.
Not everyone can.	Ba kowa bane zai iya.
You became right after so many years.	Kun zama daidai bayan shekaru da yawa.
I will tell you exactly the same statement.	Zan gaya muku daidai wannan magana.
I know what passion is.	Na san menene sha'awar.
That can't happen.	Wannan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
Sometimes the speed of this is brought in, sometimes it is not.	Wani lokaci ana kawo gudu na cikin wannan, wani lokacin ba haka bane.
Whatever you see, tell us.	Duk abin da kuke gani, gaya mana.
Just let me.	Kawai bari na.
They will make a mistake.	Za su yi kuskure.
It is a pleasure to be at home.	Abin farin ciki da zama a gida.
It's like traveling somewhere.	Kamar tafiya wani wuri ne.
Make her do it.	Ka sanya ta yi.
Someone who didn’t do well.	Wani wanda bai yi kyau ba.
What a world, what a world.	Me duniya, me duniya.
And it should.	Kuma ya kamata.
I think about it a lot.	Ina tunani game da shi da yawa.
The game is saved.	An ajiye wasan.
Or she refuses.	Ko kuma ta ƙi.
I did it.	Na yi shi.
Good on great work as always.	Yayi kyau akan babban aiki kamar koyaushe.
But it can be awful.	Amma yana iya zama mummunan abu.
We can see.	Za mu iya gani.
She will take good care of you, don't worry.	Za ta kula da ku sosai, kar ku damu.
And it was planned relatively quickly.	Kuma an shirya in mun gwada da sauri.
Things get really weird, very fast.	Abubuwa suna samun ban mamaki sosai, da sauri sosai.
Hurry up.	Yi sauri.
She assured him he could.	Ta tabbatar masa zai iya.
You have to take it inside sometimes.	Dole ne ku kai shi ciki wani lokaci.
And watch it come back to you.	Kuma ku duba ya dawo gare ku.
I do not allow you to know him.	Ban yarda ka san shi ba.
Sleep now, my child.	Yi barci yanzu, yaro na.
We have no water.	Ba mu da ruwa.
They will sing.	Za su yi waƙa.
And it was easy to do.	Kuma ya kasance mai sauƙi a yi.
We are talking about it.	Muna magana game da shi.
Not so much, he quickly realized.	Ba sosai ba, da sauri ya gane.
He is not waiting for you.	Bata da jiran ku.
Primarily.	Da farko.
He does this sometimes.	Yana yin haka wani lokaci.
Let me try to explain.	Bari in gwada in bayyana.
Some do not like eating fish.	Wasu ba sa son cin kifi.
Things did not feel right.	Abubuwa ba su ji daidai ba.
You left me with nothing.	Kun bar ni da komai.
You just left it.	Kun bar shi kawai.
They worked together.	Sun yi tare.
Either way, anytime.	Kowane hanya, kowane lokaci.
She could not take it.	Ta kasa dauka.
It is not liked.	Ba a son shi.
How to make a living out of your passion	Yadda ake yin rayuwa daga sha'awar ku
And there was no way to get on board.	Kuma babu hanyar shiga cikin jirgin.
They may not think so.	Wataƙila ba za su yi tunani ba.
It must be night.	Dole ne dare yayi.
I went on the big end too.	Na tafi a kan babban karshen kuma.
She ate twice as usual.	Ta ci sau biyu kamar yadda ta saba.
But there is one more thing before you go.	Amma akwai ƙarin abu guda kafin ku tafi.
It seems to be fulfilled.	Da alama ya cika haka.
Do you think she will succeed?	Kuna tsammanin za ta yi nasara?
To change course.	Don canza hanya.
So she does not know how to respond.	Don haka bata san yadda zata amsa ba.
No one even played.	Ba wanda ko da wasa.
Either way, that’s exactly what this is.	Ta wata hanya, wannan shine ainihin abin da wannan yake.
It is cold now.	Yanzu ya yi sanyi.
I saw what they did there.	Na ga abin da suka yi a can.
They are still working.	Har yanzu suna aiki.
He used to make money.	Ya kasance yana neman kudi.
He is very tired.	Ya gaji sosai.
Maybe he called it.	Wataƙila ya kira shi.
Call me.	Kira ne.
All you have to do is trust me, now.	Duk abin da za ku yi shi ne yarda da ni, yanzu.
But she thought maybe it was you.	Amma ta yi tunanin watakila shi ne kai.
Weep slowly.	Kuka take a hankali.
Would you like to see how it is done?	Kuna son ganin yadda aka yi?.
It works and will work in the future.	Yana aiki kuma zai yi aiki a nan gaba.
This has happened many times.	Hakan ya kasance sau da yawa.
He did not understand why he did that.	Bai gane me ya sanya shi yin haka ba.
The water is rising.	Ruwa yana tashi.
I can't see that changing.	Ba zan iya ganin cewa canza.
I was scared all night.	Na ji tsoro duk daren.
It may be the first.	Yana iya zama na farko.
It seems to be working fine.	Da alama yana aiki lafiya.
We can know.	Za mu iya sani.
We found the truth.	Mun sami gaskiya.
Of course he could not.	Tabbas bai iya ba.
It doesn't fit.	Bai dace ba.
I think you too enjoy it.	Ina tsammanin ku ma kuna jin daɗin ku.
That's what they got.	Abin da suka samu ke nan.
And there is a toll.	Kuma akwai kuɗin fito.
If only there was a time when one could catch him.	Idan da lokacin da mutum zai iya kama shi.
Others went out.	Wasu kuma suka fita.
She didn't say anything more.	Bata kara cewa komai ba.
We have other things to do.	Muna da sauran abubuwan da za mu yi.
However, it does not work.	Duk da haka, ba ya aiki.
However, using them is not as easy as it seems.	Duk da haka, yin amfani da su ba shi da sauƙi kamar yadda ake gani.
The bigger they are, the faster the process.	Mafi girma su ne, da sauri da hanya ne.
It will take people.	Zai dauki mutane.
The meeting continued day and night.	Dare da rana aka ci gaba da taron.
I want to read what you have to say.	Ina son karanta abin da za ku ce.
It became what we were doing.	Sai ya zama abin da muke yi.
I shouldn't have done that.	Bai kamata in yi wannan ba.
He never got them.	Bai taba samun su ba.
I will not try.	Ba zan gwada ba.
If you’re not used to it, don’t worry.	Idan ba ku saba ba, kada ku damu.
She knew exactly what to say.	Ta san ainihin abin da za ta ce.
He certainly could not.	Lallai bai iya hakan ba.
I worked with him.	Na yi aiki da shi.
It's time.	Lokaci ya yi.
It is common.	Na kowa ne.
It is wrong to kill people.	Ba daidai ba ne a kashe mutane.
They love it.	Suna son shi.
She couldn’t see how anyone could get a better job out of it.	Ba ta iya ganin yadda kowa zai iya samun kyakkyawan aiki daga abin.
Now it needs a new name.	Yanzu yana buƙatar sabon suna.
I like everything about it.	Ina son komai game da shi.
I will always love you.	Zan so ku koyaushe.
That's right.	Haka yake.
If you have one, get up.	Idan kana da daya, tashi.
We need to plan the best we can.	Muna buƙatar shirya mafi kyawun abin da za mu iya.
He wanted to, he laughed.	Ya so, ya yi dariya.
Where is she going?	Ina ta je?
Everything was so simple.	Komai ya zama mai sauƙi.
Exactly like yesterday.	Daidai kamar jiya.
When taken together.	Lokacin da aka ɗauka tare.
We don’t have many people traveling right now.	Ba mu da mutane da yawa da ke tafiya a yanzu.
What do we think about when we stop thinking?	Menene muke tunani game da lokacin da muka daina tunani?
Find out how.	Gano yadda.
You are good in this way too, you make everyone around you laugh.	Kun kasance masu kyau a wannan hanyar kuma, kuna sa duk wanda ke kusa da ku dariya.
She moved forward.	Ta yi gaba da gaba.
It looks right on you.	Ya yi kama da kai daidai.
Maybe something you never did.	Wataƙila wani abu da ba ku taɓa yi ba.
So he signed.	Don haka ya sa hannu.
We are for these things.	Mun kasance ga waɗannan abubuwa.
This request was rejected.	An ƙi wannan buƙatar.
I still do not know what to do with it.	Har yanzu ban san abin da zan yi da shi ba.
Please make sure you want to do this.	Da fatan za a tabbatar cewa kuna son yin wannan.
Whether they will close or not.	Ko za su rufe ko a'a.
But you never come.	Amma ba ka taba zuwa ba.
You must remove the garment completely.	Dole ne ku cire rigar gaba daya.
The one who has the most money is the one who pays the most.	Wanda ya fi kowa kudi ne ya fi biya.
I'm sorry.	Na yi hakuri.
Let's get started !.	Mu fara!.
We could not enter.	Ba mu iya shiga ba.
This comes from a good reading.	Wannan ya zo daga kyakkyawan karatu.
He tried to leave her several times.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya bar shi sau da yawa.
Something must have gone wrong.	Dole ne a sami wani abu ba daidai ba.
He is gone now.	Ya tafi yanzu.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
When swimming, always wear a sunscreen.	Lokacin da za ku yi iyo, a koyaushe ku sanya rigar rana.
I went inside.	Na shiga ciki.
They have one man there, and one man.	Suna da mutum ɗaya a wurin, mutum ɗaya kuma.
Get ready today !.	Ku shirya yau!.
I kept it up.	Na ci gaba da shi.
That is the first thing.	Abu na farko kenan.
And the previous one.	Kuma wanda ya gabata.
The game is out.	Wasan ya fita.
So just sit and watch how.	Sai ku zauna kawai mu kula da yadda.
It causes you trouble, and I have trouble.	Ta kawo muku matsala, ni kuma da wahala.
I can't find more.	Ba zan iya neman ƙarin ba.
It is his home.	Gidan sa ne.
Obviously, someone has.	Babu shakka, wani yana da.
I can only imagine what an amazing event this was.	Zan iya tunanin abin da ya faru na ban mamaki wannan.
Somehow I can work.	Ko ta yaya na iya aiki.
The time has come.	Lokaci ya zo.
You see.	Kuna gani.
This is your last chance!	Wannan shine damar ku ta ƙarshe!
Exactly where they can go.	Daidai inda za su iya zuwa.
However it is.	Duk da haka yana da.
Sometimes this thing is a tool.	Wani lokaci wannan abu kayan aiki ne.
I have many and good ones.	Ina da yawa kuma masu kyau.
It's been 30 years since it was closed.	Yau shekara talatin kenan a rufe.
They let her give us food she brought from outside.	Suka bar ta ta ba mu abincin da ta kawo daga waje.
One knows another.	Wani ya san wani.
They are real people.	Mutane ne na gaske.
Even what lies ahead.	Ko da abin da ke gaba.
But pay attention to what you want.	Amma ku kula da abin da kuke so.
However, she refused to call.	Duk da haka, ta ƙi yarda ta kira.
It will be very difficult.	Zai yi wuya sosai.
Wait a second	Jira na biyu
Water was provided as needed.	An ba da ruwa kamar yadda ake bukata.
Fun work, which is always done.	Aiki mai dadi, wanda ake yi kullum.
It must have been.	Lallai ya kasance.
He took a job, but did not have time.	Ya ɗauki aiki, amma ba shi da lokaci.
These will probably be caught soon.	Wataƙila za a kama waɗannan da sauri.
Not so, though.	Ba haka ba ne, ko da yake.
She continued.	Ta ci gaba.
I think it's good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau.
You can't just go outside!	Ba za ku fita waje kawai ba!
You do not have to go in.	Ba sai ka shiga ciki ba.
You only know what to do.	Kun san kawai abin da za ku yi.
It is raining today.	Ana ruwan sama a yau.
You must get, get, get!	Dole ne ku samu, samu, samu!
Or as fast as it can be instantly.	Ko kuma da sauri ta yadda zai iya zama nan take.
I am very sure about it.	Na tabbata sosai game da shi.
How quickly has it changed?	Yaya ta canza da sauri?
So use it carefully.	Don haka a yi amfani da shi a hankali.
There are so many.	Akwai mutane da yawa.
Only man.	Mutum kadai.
You are right about them.	Kun yi gaskiya game da su.
I do not mind.	Ban damu ba.
He did not ask her to stay.	Bai nemi ta zauna ba.
He has no interest in making money.	Ba shi da sha'awar samun kuɗi.
It is all.	Shi ne duka.
I want to work, to write, to be as funny as he is.	Ina so in yi aiki, in rubuta, in zama mai ban dariya kamar shi.
We can never know where he came from.	Ba za mu taba iya tabbatar da inda ya fito ba.
Only one made it close.	Daya ne kawai ya sanya shi rufe.
Imagine they had never been seen before.	Ka yi tunanin ba a taɓa ganin su sama sama ba.
We feel like we’ve proven that.	Mun ji kamar mun tabbatar da haka.
I should have been	Ya kamata in kasance
Failure to work, you die.	Kasa aikin, ka mutu.
I will sleep with them.	Zan kwana da su.
What seems to be the problem? 	Menene alama shine matsala?
the doctor said.	likitan yace.
Have a nice weekend.	Yi kyakkyawan karshen mako.
Take your time though.	Ɗauki lokacin ku ko da yake.
She forgot everything.	Ta manta komai.
I can’t do this job until people stop.	Ba zan iya yin wannan aikin ba har sai mutane sun daina.
Some of it is necessary.	Wasu daga ciki ya zama dole.
That was out of hand, he thought.	Wannan yana daga hannu, ya yi tunani.
For a long time I thought you were right.	Na dade ina tunanin kana da gaskiya.
Still alive and everything.	Har yanzu da rai da komai.
It should feel uncomfortable.	Ya kamata ya ji ba dadi.
There is something in it.	Akwai wani abu a ciki.
I know this is scary.	Na san wannan abin ban tsoro ne.
Looking behind you around him.	Kallon bayan ku a kusa da shi.
Behold, they shall not return.	Ga shi, ba za su koma ba.
They want to do well in the workplace.	Suna so su yi kyau a wurin aiki.
I still have a job.	Har yanzu ina da aikin yi.
She did.	Haka ta yi.
Let's get started.	Mu fara.
Just turned off.	An kashe kawai.
It is not good to be prepared.	Ba shi da kyau a shirya shi.
He did nothing.	Bai yi komai ba.
Maybe he got up from there to do what he wanted.	Watakila ya tashi daga wurin don yin abin da yake so.
Imagine being able to do that.	Ka yi tunanin idan aka yi maka haka.
Do not forget anything.	Kar ka manta da komai.
I heard a little out of place.	Na ji kadan daga wurin.
Everyone knows it.	Kowa ya san shi.
Now it seems he will do just that.	Yanzu da alama zai yi haka kawai.
This is not nearly a surprise.	Wannan ba kusan abin ban mamaki ba ne.
I think she knows somehow.	Ina tsammanin ta san ko ta yaya.
Certainly not for me.	Tabbas ba don ni ba.
We are ready when you are.	Mun shirya lokacin da kuke.
More often than not.	Sau da yawa kuma.
I don't even want to do it.	Ba na ma so in yi.
Very few have met them.	Kadan ne suka hadu da su.
So you have to eat them all on the first day.	Don haka dole ne ku ci su duka a ranar farko.
Or you feel pain.	Ko kuma ka ji zafi.
So, start from editing it.	Don haka, fara daga gyara shi.
It was not so.	Ba haka ya kasance ba.
Hope it helps you too.	Da fatan ya taimaka muku ma.
Of course not.	Ba shakka ba za su yi ba.
Then two.	Sai kuma guda biyu.
He did as he pleased.	Ya yi yadda ya ga dama.
Travel has changed that.	Tafiya ta canza hakan.
She wondered if he felt the same way.	Ta yi tunanin ko shi ma haka yake ji.
They eat me outside the house.	Suna cin ni a waje da gida.
But we need to know.	Amma muna bukatar mu sani.
Someone who wants to meet.	Wani da ya so mu hadu.
But that does not work.	Amma ba haka yake aiki ba.
We can buy.	Za mu iya saya.
I will take you with me.	Zan tafi da ku tare da ni.
You have nothing in your money.	Ba ku da abubuwa a cikin kuɗin ku.
I have to come back.	Dole na dawo.
But they often need great outdoor equipment.	Amma sau da yawa suna buƙatar babban kayan aiki na waje.
I have been waiting for thirty years.	Na yi shekara talatin ina jira.
She needs a car.	Tana bukatar mota.
How you were all.	Yadda kuka kasance duka.
Everyone is fine, at least.	Kowa yana lafiya, ko kadan.
And it's a joke.	Kuma abin wasa ne.
We have found this to happen many times and we have used a similar response.	Mun sami wannan ya faru sau da yawa kuma mun yi amfani da irin wannan amsa.
He alone was not alone.	Shi kadai ya kasance ba haka kawai ba.
Remember that they will eat almost everything.	Ka tuna cewa za su ci kusan komai.
Play with it to see what happens.	Yi wasa da shi don ganin abin da ya faru.
He will know that.	Zai san haka.
You may have read about it.	Wataƙila kun karanta game da shi.
We are not fighting.	Ba muna fada ba.
That made her human.	Hakan yasa ta zama mutum.
Suddenly it was here.	Nan da nan sai ga shi nan.
I saw the road.	Na ga hanya.
I really have to take care of myself.	Lallai dole ne in kula da kaina.
Go where he wants.	Ka je inda yake so.
This is all for us humans.	Wannan duka mu mutane abu ne.
What is your favorite book?	Menene littafin da kuka fi so?
I don't want to leave you.	Bana son barin ku.
And we will get help.	Kuma za mu sami taimako.
He sat in it.	Ya zauna a ciki.
Not suicide, of course.	Ban da kashe kansa, ba shakka.
Somehow he helped me.	Ko ta yaya ya taimake ni.
But things always change.	Amma kowane lokaci abubuwa sun canza.
He plays very well.	Yana wasa sosai.
He told her.	Da ya gaya mata.
No one defending us could catch me.	Babu wanda ke kare mu da ya iya kama ni.
You had better go at the same time.	Gara ku tafi lokaci guda.
She did a good job showing you how to do it.	Ta yi aiki mai kyau tana nuna muku yadda ake yi.
He was never sick.	Bai taba rashin lafiya ba.
However, we were more together than we had ever been.	Duk da haka, mun kasance tare fiye da yadda muke da shi.
Doing everything is easy.	Yin komai ya zama mai sauƙi.
It is that nothing feels real to you without them there.	Yana da cewa babu wani abu da ya ji na gaske a gare ku in ba tare da su a can.
We are a working, working world.	Mu duniya ce mai aiki, aiki.
Dinner is too late.	Abincin dare ya makara.
Really? 	Da gaske?
I think I can get into that.	Ina tsammanin zan iya shiga cikin wannan.
But dinner is not a big deal.	Amma abincin dare ba wani babban abu bane.
That's all.	Wannan duka abu.
But knowledge did not help.	Amma sanin bai taimaka ba.
He knew.	Ya sani.
She cries again.	Kuka ta sake yi.
Think about it now.	Ka yi tunani a kai yanzu.
So, we.	Saboda haka, mu .
But not there.	Amma ba a can ba.
Please stay.	Da fatan za a zauna.
But they made a mistake.	Amma sun yi kuskure su ɗauka wannan.
It will be the first time, if it happens.	Zai zama karo na farko, idan ya faru.
But there is still time.	Amma akwai sauran lokaci.
I would love to see more though.	Ina son ganin ƙarin ko da yake.
Just like women do when they are like her.	Kamar yadda mata suke yi idan sun kasance irin ta.
This is what was done to them.	Haka aka yi masu.
And that's not how other people work.	Kuma ba haka sauran mutane suke aiki ba.
Man, time goes by.	Mutum, lokaci yana tafiya.
He is here all weekend.	Yana nan duk karshen mako.
But that is not enough.	Amma wannan bai isa ba.
It's delicious, really.	Yana da dadi, da gaske.
No doubt some people will like this very much.	Babu shakka wasu mutane za su so wannan da gaske.
We are working on it.	Muna aiki da shi.
It felt like a movie.	Ya ji kamar fim.
You need me.	Kuna bukata ni.
We thought something healthy was interesting so it didn’t get cold.	Mun yi tunanin wani abu mai lafiya yana da ban sha'awa don haka bai yi sanyi ba.
Not just changed, though.	Ba kawai canza ba, amma.
Now, let's try this again.	Yanzu, bari mu sake gwada wannan.
Just remove it.	Cire shi kawai.
So you get the most out of your money.	Don haka kuna samun mafi yawan kuɗin ku.
We will give you a cool coffee!	Za mu ba ku kofi mai sanyi!
I have never seen the room.	Ban taba ganin dakin ba.
When you get the chance, of course.	Lokacin da kuka sami dama, ba shakka.
There are so many ways.	Akwai hanya da yawa da yawa.
She can run fast.	Tana iya gudu da sauri.
We only got one car.	Mota daya kawai muka samu.
She can't drive.	Ba za ta iya tuƙi ba.
We thought we did.	Mun dauka mun yi.
Maybe it's a lack of food.	Wataƙila rashin abinci ne.
But let me explain.	Amma bari in bayyana.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Amma da alama hakan baya faruwa.
We refused to proceed.	Mun ƙi ci gaba.
They did not pay me.	Ba su biya ni ba.
Let's hope it goes well!	Bari mu yi fatan zai zama da kyau!
She too will come here.	Ita ma za ta zo nan.
It will never happen.	Ba zai taba faruwa ba.
We can run.	Za mu iya gudu.
I didn’t use it myself but tried this.	Ban yi amfani da kaina ba amma gwada wannan.
Come and take a look.	Ku zo ku duba da kyau.
I’m not sure about any location.	Ban tabbata ba game da wani wuri.
It did me good.	Ya yi min kyau.
They bought a car, but it didn't look good.	Sun sayi mota, amma ba ta yi kyau ba.
But now it is too late.	Amma yanzu ya makara.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
Not much of it, though.	Ba yawa daga ciki, ko da yake.
It's a good job.	Aiki ne mai kyau.
That is amazing.	Hakan yana da ban mamaki.
Everything works fine.	Duk yana aiki lafiya.
It will come like one.	Zai zo kamar daya.
That you would do if she did not.	Da za ku yi idan ba ta yi ba.
How they make you do things.	Yadda suke sa ku yin abubuwa.
I feel this statement very well now.	Ina jin wannan magana sosai yanzu.
Things are going well.	Abubuwa sun yi kyau sosai.
Sure,	Tabbas,
He did nothing.	Bai yi komai ba.
And everything went smoothly.	Kuma komai ya tafi daidai.
These players have a chance this year.	Waɗannan 'yan wasan suna da damar su a wannan shekara.
It was not a good time for me.	Ba lokaci ne mai kyau a gare ni ba.
Maybe that’s why the game surprised me so much.	Wataƙila wannan shine dalilin da ya sa wasan ya ba ni mamaki sosai.
I do not know what is going on.	Ban san me ke faruwa ba.
The day he arrived home.	Ranar da ya isa gida.
This also happens before each game.	Wannan kuma yana faruwa kafin kowane wasa.
It's early.	Yana da wuri.
I did not miss the time to come here.	Ban rasa lokacin zuwa nan ba.
Some want to go.	Wasu suna so su tafi.
She could not let this continue.	Ta kasa barin wannan ya ci gaba.
Leave it to the police.	A bar wa ‘yan sanda.
This is work.	Wannan aiki ne.
I think to myself now.	Ina tunanin kaina yanzu.
He did before like.	Ya yi kafin kamar.
Let's start from the beginning.	Bari mu fara daga farko.
Whatever came at the time, she did not know.	Duk abin da ya zo a lokacin, ba ta sani ba.
He wore a bracelet.	Ya sa abin hannu.
She finds that she enjoys the project.	Ta gano cewa tana jin daɗin wannan aikin.
It is better to wait.	Gara ya jira.
In this movie and every movie they do.	A cikin wannan fim da kowane fim da suka yi.
I forgot myself.	Na manta kaina.
I do not know where.	Bata san ina ba.
I'm crying.	Ina kuka tana nan.
She didn't stop talking.	Bata bar magana ba.
I will tell him so much more.	Zan ce masa haka da yawa kuma.
I have to go.	Dole na tafi.
It will be fine.	Zata yi kyau.
Not like me, though.	Ba irin nawa bane, ko da yake.
I had to kill that pleasure for two days.	Dole ne in kashe wannan jin daɗin kwana biyu.
This is something new for me.	Wannan wani sabon abu ne a gare ni.
No food.	Babu abinci.
We are doing the work immediately.	Muna yin aikin nan da nan.
You should too.	Ya kamata ku ma.
And we got a lot of tools.	Kuma mun sami kayan aiki da yawa.
I am being sold on it.	Ana sayar da ni a kansa.
We clashed again.	Mun sake cin karo da juna.
That worked for me.	Hakan yayi min aiki.
Try to do that.	Yi ƙoƙarin yin hakan.
This is more fun.	Wannan ya fi jin daɗi.
I think so.	Ina tsammanin shi.
Everything has to come from somewhere.	Dole ne komai ya fito daga wani wuri.
Hope to see you there.	Da fatan ganin ku a can.
You try to think of it.	Kuna ƙoƙarin yin tunani da ita.
Let's not talk for a moment.	Kada mu yi magana na ɗan lokaci.
Thus, making it difficult.	A haka, yin shi da wuya.
The fish here is amazing.	Irin kifi a nan yana da ban mamaki.
She looked back.	Ta kalli baya.
We do not even recognize it.	Ba mu ma gane shi ba.
We did not eat from it.	Ba mu ci daga gare ta ba.
We still want you to succeed.	Har yanzu muna son ku yi nasara.
He lifted my hand.	Sai ya daga min hannu.
Do you want to come together?	Kuna so ku zo tare?
We still have a lot to learn from her.	Har yanzu mun koyi abubuwa da yawa daga gare ta.
There is a reason why we are still here.	Akwai dalilin da ya sa har yanzu muna nan.
The doctor on duty, he explained.	Likitan da ke bakin aiki, ya bayyana.
All you need is metal parts.	Abin da kuke bukata shine abubuwan da aka yi da karfe.
They gave us the money we needed to do the work.	Sun ba mu kuɗin da muke bukata don yin aikin.
I have a big dog.	Ina da kare girma.
I do not watch or talk to anyone.	Ba na kallon ko magana da kowa.
I do not know why this is happening, but it is.	Ban san dalilin da yasa hakan ke faruwa ba, amma haka ne.
One thing is certain.	Abu daya ya tabbata.
I only checked twice.	Na duba sau biyu kawai.
I need to talk to you about some things.	Ina bukata in yi magana da ku game da wasu abubuwa.
It is the last resort.	Hanya ce ta ƙarshe.
Still, even leaving, in the end.	Har yanzu, ko da barin, a ƙarshe.
If you enter.	Idan kun shiga.
They quickly fled.	Da sauri suka gudu.
I looked around the room.	Na kalli dakin.
I hope help is coming, though.	Ina fatan taimako yana zuwa, ko da yake.
I will do the right thing.	Zan yi abin da ya dace.
I do not have.	Ba ni da.
It was just amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki kawai.
It does something for me.	Yana yi min wani abu.
There is only one thing to do.	Abu daya ne kawai mu yi.
In the end we did too much.	A ƙarshe mun yi yawa.
I won once	Na yi nasara sau daya
He did everything he could.	Ya yi duk abin da zai iya.
They go to the front door.	Suna zuwa kofar gida.
I'll take the room, in fact.	Zan dauki dakin, a gaskiya.
Do not say anything.	Kar ka ce komai.
For women too.	Ga mata kuma.
Stop and think for a moment.	Tsaya da tunani na ɗan lokaci.
And you can't do that until you know who the person is.	Kuma ba za ku iya yin hakan ba sai kun san ko wanene mutumin.
He sure couldn’t feel right.	Ya tabbata ba zai iya ji daidai ba.
Go to today's meeting.	Ku tafi taron yau.
Though it feels good on my skin.	Ko da yake yana jin daɗi a fata ta.
The kids are so amazing.	Yara suna da ban mamaki sosai.
They do not like each other.	Ba sa son juna.
Be serious.	Kasance da gaske.
He studied hard, but left homework.	Yayi karatu sosai, amma ya bar aikin gida.
I don't want him to go yet.	Bana son ya tafi tukuna.
No one likes it.	Babu wanda yake son shi.
It is a very successful project.	Aiki ne mai matukar nasara.
After three days they decided to stop drinking.	Bayan kwana uku suka yanke shawarar su daina sha.
The three of them laughed.	Dariya su uku suka yi.
I did not find anything about them.	Ban sami komai game da su ba.
He is accustomed to taking care of himself.	Ya saba da kula da kansa.
I want a chance.	Ina son wata dama.
He always came back.	Kullum sai ya dawo.
No, it's fun.	A'a, yana jin daɗi.
Of course he did not know.	Tabbas bai sani ba.
I just said.	Na fada kawai.
I do not want to say.	Bana son fada.
Not years yet.	Ba shekaru ba tukuna.
I see this here somewhere.	Na ga haka a nan wani wuri.
Maybe that's why they like her so much.	Wataƙila wannan shine dalilin da ya sa suke son ta sosai.
How it helps you become what you are today.	Yadda yake taimaka muku zama abin da kuke a yau.
They must have this.	Dole ne su sami wannan.
He lost his temper and laughed.	Ya rasa sai yayi dariya.
I'm a little worried now.	Na ɗan damu kaina yanzu.
He could not see anything.	Bai iya ganin komai ba.
I hated the thought of leaving.	Na ƙi tunanin barin.
They seem to be dead.	Da alama sun mutu.
I will read this.	Zan karanta wannan.
None.	Babu ko ɗaya.
He is wearing the sails of a ship.	Yana sanye da rigar wani jirgin ruwa.
She always looks so good to me.	Kullum tana yi min kyau sosai.
But he felt he should, for sure.	Amma ya ji ya kamata, don ya tabbata.
We keep playing really well.	Muna ci gaba da wasa sosai.
He knows we are there.	Ya san muna can.
You will want to try it out.	Za ku so ku gwada shi.
That will not happen.	Hakan ba zai faru ba.
Nothing to buy.	Babu abin da za a saya.
It's not like you can't.	Ba kamar ba za ku iya ba.
But that was the next step.	Amma hakan ya kasance na gaba.
They have none.	Ba su da ko ɗaya.
You should continue this way.	Ya kamata ku ci gaba da wannan hanyar.
I want him to be the one we know.	Ina so ya zama wanda muka sani.
Be careful with the dog.	Yi hankali da kare.
It's a little uncomfortable.	Ya dan ji dadi.
We learned what this and other things can do.	Mun koyi abin da wannan da sauran abubuwa za su iya yi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lokaci yayi don jin daɗi.
Do not smoke.	Kar a sha taba.
He doesn't like that.	Ba ya son hakan.
He tried coffee, but coffee didn't help.	Ya gwada kofi, amma kofi bai taimaka ba.
He can have everything now.	Zai iya samun komai yanzu.
I can't see you like that.	Ba zan iya ganin ku haka ba.
I was very close.	Na yi kusa sosai.
Even as good as.	Ko da kyau kamar yadda.
I will check tomorrow.	Zan duba gobe.
We must tell others what we have found.	Dole ne mu gaya wa sauran abin da muka samu.
It turned out to be an interesting game.	Ya zama wasa mai ban sha'awa.
Of course we do too.	Gaskiya mu ma muna yi.
She does not want help.	Ba ta son taimako.
They are so beautiful.	Sun yi kyau sosai.
I think it's funny.	Ina tsammanin abin dariya ne.
They got it.	Sun samu.
That is why I was brought.	Shi ya sa aka kawo min.
No, it is not.	A'a, ba haka ba ne.
Someone is inside.	Wani yana ciki.
I have to get out of the water.	Dole ne in fita daga cikin ruwa.
That we cannot do.	Wannan ba za mu iya yi ba.
The water is hot.	Ruwan ya yi zafi.
It's so good.	Yana da kyau haka.
If that is the case for you.	Idan hakan ya kasance a gare ku.
Try not to sit too close.	Yi ƙoƙarin kada ku zauna a kusa.
So very close.	Don haka kusa da kyau sosai.
People like to spend a lot of money on food.	Mutane suna son kashe kuɗi da yawa akan abinci.
You must print now.	Dole ne ku buga yanzu.
Then she began to panic.	Sai ta fara tsoro.
I'm glad you're close.	Na yi farin ciki da kuna kusa.
This interest was my first priority.	Wannan sha'awar ita ce ta farko a gare ni.
But my fight continued.	Amma fada na ya ci gaba.
Like it or not, it is a fact of life.	So ko a'a, gaskiya ce ta rayuwa.
Or so it starts, how.	Ko haka zai fara, ta yaya.
He looked at his employer.	Ya kalli mai aikin sa.
They said.	Sai suka ce.
She adjusted her posture.	Ta gyara zama a hankali.
I do not feel well today.	Bana jin dadi yau.
Funny, of course.	Abin ban dariya, babu shakka.
Everyone can see that.	Kowane mutum na iya ganin haka.
I will kill for myself.	Zan kashe wa kaina.
Now you are not.	Yanzu ba kai ba.
We know that now.	Mun san haka a yanzu.
I remember how it was.	Na tuna yadda abin yake.
Sometimes they give a little talk.	Wani lokaci suna ba da ɗan magana.
But it does not need to be true.	Amma baya buƙatar zama gaskiya.
Everyone interested in doing so is dead.	Duk masu sha'awar yin hakan sun mutu.
You can look it up.	Kuna iya duba shi sama.
He brought it there.	Ya kawo shi can.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
Others keep coming.	Wasu kuma suna ta zuwa.
It's not really scary.	Ba tsoro bane da gaske.
He is right about that.	Yana da gaskiya game da hakan.
I have to travel.	Dole na yi tafiya.
Heads up!	A kula!
This statement, however, is not enough.	Wannan magana, duk da haka, bai isa ba.
Nothing, but until they get there.	Ba komai, amma sai da suka isa wurin.
He will get that.	Zai samu hakan.
I don’t know how useful this is.	Ban san yadda wannan yake da amfani ba.
The material was amazing.	Kayan ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
It's not very good.	Ba shi da kyau sosai.
This man has never been married.	Wannan mutumin bai taba yin aure ba.
That did not work well.	Hakan bai yi kyau ba.
No, we will tell you.	A'a, za mu gaya muku su.
Where are you going to go this time.	A ina za ku yi tafiya wannan lokacin.
Someone who did well.	Wani wanda yayi kyau.
That surprised me.	Hakan ya bani mamaki.
Yet that is what we wrote.	Duk da haka abin da muka rubuta ke nan.
No, you do not.	A'a, ba ku da.
I hated your work and took the opportunity to quit.	Na ƙi aikin ku kuma na yi amfani da damar na daina.
In fact he never did.	A gaskiya bai taba yin haka ba.
It came from nothing.	Ba daga komai ya fito ba.
Some you forget some and you remember.	Wasu ka manta wasu kuma ka tuna.
They get things done.	Suna samun abubuwa.
The article was written.	An rubuta labarin.
I really like this.	Ina son wannan sosai.
It worked for us of course, so it probably could help.	Ya yi mana aiki ba shakka, don haka tabbas zai iya taimaka.
The house is not good.	Gidan babu kyau.
He opened one door.	Ya bude kofar daya.
But, this is not very good.	Amma, wannan ba shi da kyau sosai.
We felt really good.	Mun ji dadi sosai.
Does he really have reason to feel that way?	Shin da gaske yana da dalilin jin haka?
They are scary things.	Abubuwa ne masu ban tsoro.
That's something, he thinks.	Wannan wani abu ne, yana tunani.
He is just like us.	Shi kamar mu ne.
You must help us.	Lallai ka taimake mu.
Stick for every meal.	Sanda don kowane abinci.
They have two children.	Suna da yara biyu.
The work is a lot.	Aikin yana da yawa.
I was there.	Na kasance a can.
Of course this will be done again.	Tabbas za a sake yin wannan.
It seems to be very large.	Da alama girma sosai.
This is my last chance.	Wannan ita ce dama ta ta ƙarshe.
And, you know, you read a lot of things.	Kuma, ka sani, kuna karanta abubuwa da yawa.
I know what.	Na san menene.
She started drinking a lot.	Ta fara sha da yawa.
I'm in it now, she thought.	Na shiga ciki yanzu, ta yi tunani.
It works for me.	Yana yi mini aiki.
Time goes on.	Lokaci ya ci gaba.
Tell people what you did.	Ka gaya wa mutane abin da ka yi.
I just walked.	Na yi tafiya kawai.
You'd better get out of here.	Gara ku fita daga nan.
This is mine.	Wannan nawa ne.
I thought it was you.	Na dauka kai ne.
Keep walking.	Ci gaba da tafiya.
He continued slowly.	Ya ci gaba a hankali.
Nice to see.	Yayi kyau a gani.
Police say local time.	'Yan sanda sun ce lokacin gida.
And that did not just happen.	Kuma hakan ba kawai ya faru ba.
Probably all of these.	Wataƙila duk waɗannan ne.
But he got this and put us behind.	Amma ya samu wannan ya ajiye mu a baya.
They need food and water.	Suna buƙatar abinci da ruwa.
Until the water runs out.	Har ruwa ya yanke.
And do not think.	Kada kuma ku yi tunani.
I hope you are well.	Ina fatan kuna lafiya.
I just want to be on my own.	Ina so kawai in kasance da kaina.
Not married, no.	Ba aure, babu.
It is indeed a good work.	Lallai aiki ne mai kyau.
We know they are hot.	Mun san suna da zafi.
Outside he tells you everything.	Waje ya ce maka komai.
Some were successful, some were not.	Wasu sun yi nasara, wasu ba su kasance ba.
Maybe she didn’t mind being alone with him.	Watakila ba ta damu da zama ita kadai da shi ba.
We cannot continue like this.	Ba za mu iya ci gaba a haka ba.
We think it can somehow.	Muna tsammanin yana iya ko ta yaya.
She is not.	Ba ita ba ce.
I can't run very well.	Ba zan iya gudu sosai ba.
Just finish this.	Kawai gama wannan.
We protect each other.	Muna kare juna.
We are shown around the owner.	An nuna mana a kusa da mai shi.
So, you have a reason to try them.	Don haka, kuna da dalilin gwada su.
But he knew.	Amma ya sani.
The next one may or may not be.	Na gaba na iya zama ko a'a.
You have a year.	Kuna da shekara.
He began to drink.	Ya fara sha.
But we should not stop there.	Amma bai kamata mu tsaya a nan ba.
She did not know what to say.	Bata san me zata yarda ba.
She kept walking.	Ta ci gaba da tafiya.
Doing something out of nothing.	Yin wani abu daga komai.
We are not finished yet.	Har yanzu ba mu gama ba.
The run passed him.	Da gudu ta wuce shi.
Try it, please.	Gwada shi, don Allah.
And you must be.	Kuma dole ne ku kasance.
There are ways to do things.	Akwai yadda ake yin abubuwa.
He was later.	Da ya kasance daga baya.
That should be sufficient enough to cover our expenses.	Wannan zai isa ya biya mana kuɗin mu.
He looked constantly.	Ya duba kullum.
That upset me.	Hakan ya bata min rai.
The door is still open.	Har yanzu kofar a bude take.
Just call me when you can.	Kawai kira ni lokacin da za ku iya.
Good dog too.	Kare mai kyau ma.
Now I know what he is thinking.	Yanzu na san abin da yake tunani.
You will stop trying to prove otherwise.	Za ku daina ƙoƙarin tabbatar da in ba haka ba.
I think you will too.	Ina tsammanin za ku kuma.
What is missing.	Me aka rasa.
He ran very fast.	Yayi gudu sosai.
She encountered an unexpected problem.	Ta ci karo da matsalar da bata zata ba.
It may be better to think honestly.	Yana iya zama da kyau a yi tunanin gaskiya.
It also makes me feel like an athlete.	Shi ma ya sa na zama kamar dan wasa.
Something caught him here.	Wani abu ya kama shi a nan.
He will be happy.	Zai yi farin ciki.
For one thing, he never lost money.	Abu ɗaya, bai taɓa rasa kuɗi ba.
She spoke so loudly.	Ta fad'a sosai.
I think this worked, a lot of people didn’t.	Ina tsammanin wannan ya yi aiki, mutane da yawa ba su yi ba.
If you like us, great.	Idan kuna son mu, mai girma.
It has been used for over a week with no response yet.	An yi amfani da shi har tsawon mako guda babu amsa tukuna.
They are beautiful	Suna da kyau
That says something.	Wannan ya ce wani abu.
The same was true at school.	Haka ya kasance a makaranta.
I can’t believe them in that.	Ba zan iya yarda da su a cikin wannan ba.
She is ready.	Ta shirya.
You are not what they are.	Ba ku ne abin da suke ba.
People understand that.	Mutane sun gane haka.
No one responded or confirmed that this was working.	Babu wanda ya amsa ko ya tabbatar da cewa wannan yana aiki.
Now you do well.	Yanzu ka yi kyau.
He can walk.	Yana iya tafiya.
You feel happy and successful.	Kuna jin dadi da nasara.
He will get up tomorrow morning.	Zai tashi gobe da safe.
He is tired of fighting.	Ya gaji da fada.
It is a beautiful home.	Gida ne mai kyau.
Turn off the heat.	Kashe zafi.
The same discomfort after eating.	Haka rashin jin daɗi bayan cin abinci.
When we go, he comes with us.	Idan muka tafi, yana zuwa tare da mu.
They are trying to make us stop playing.	Suna ƙoƙari su sa mu daina wasa.
Not there, but he is there.	Ba a can, amma yana can.
If nothing else, there is everything to be done.	Idan babu komai, akwai duk abin da za a yi.
They made no mistake about it.	Ba su yi kuskure ba game da hakan.
You know you like it.	Kun san kuna so.
It doesn't even look like it.	Bai ma yi kama da gaske ba.
I look at it a little bit.	Ina kallon shi kadan kadan.
A lot of a lot.	Mai yawa mai yawa.
She is full of passion.	Ta cika da sha'awa.
They would not have grown as usual, not at all.	Da ba su girma kamar yadda aka saba ba, ko kaɗan.
If you do.	Idan kun yi.
Do not do that.	Kada ku yi haka.
But of course you can hear.	Amma tabbas za ku iya ji.
I don’t know why he was upset.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa ya damu ba.
It has never been tested properly.	Ba a taɓa gwada shi yadda ya kamata ba.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
Joke!	Abin ban dariya!
You need to think about that.	Kuna buƙatar tunani game da hakan.
I know this can happen.	Na san hakan na iya faruwa.
I want it to work well.	Ina so ya yi aiki da kyau.
We are another.	Mu wani ne.
But it is me.	Amma ni ne.
There are some but not many.	Akwai wasu amma ba su da yawa.
But then I got it.	Amma sai na samu.
He arrived home.	Ya isa gida.
Not knowing how or where she started.	Ba tare da sanin ta yaya ko ta inda ta fara ba.
Do not give up.	Kada ku daina.
Not a difficult thing, the big man explained.	Ba abu mai wahala ba, babban mutumin ya bayyana.
We never got anything.	Ba mu taɓa samun komai ba.
Until you plan to do something about it.	Har sai kun shirya yin wani abu game da shi.
I have tried this and this is true.	Na gwada wannan kuma wannan gaskiya ne.
But he could not understand it.	Amma ya kasa gane haka.
Not many opportunities, and so on.	Babu dama da yawa, kuma haka ma.
She was very thoughtful and could read well.	Ta kasance mai tunani sosai kuma tana iya karanta mutane sosai.
We cannot change the past.	Ba za mu iya canza abin da ya gabata ba.
She reads very little.	Karatu kadan take yi.
I can tell you from my experiences.	Zan iya gaya muku daga abubuwan da na gani.
You have to understand that for yourself.	Dole ne ku gane hakan da kanku.
I have never felt that way.	Ban taba jin haka ba.
Now he has made them all stop.	Yanzu ya yi su duka a daina.
This is useful.	Wannan yana da amfani.
I know it's done.	Na san an yi.
We have been together for three years.	Mun yi shekara uku tare.
No one else.	Babu wani kuma.
Only good food.	Abinci mai kyau kawai.
But it was right, in a way.	Amma ya zama daidai, a wata hanya.
I think the time has come.	Ina tsammanin lokaci ya yi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lokaci yayi don jin daɗi.
Drink plenty of water.	Sha ruwa mai yawa.
No one should be skeptical about that.	Babu wanda ya kamata ya kasance cikin shakka game da hakan.
It appears that all of this has happened in the past.	Ya bayyana cewa duk wannan ya faru a baya.
They will talk about it.	Za su yi magana a kai.
Money will change hands for that, too.	Kudi za su canza hannu don wannan, kuma.
And this is true.	Kuma wannan gaskiya ne.
Please just leave it at that.	Don Allah kawai a bar shi.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
I will bring her here with me.	Zan kawo ta nan tare da ni.
She, too, could not imagine tomorrow.	Ita ma ta kasa tunanin gobe.
One will just go.	Mutum zai tafi kawai.
Heads up.	A kula.
And he immediately started thinking about how he could help me.	Kuma nan da nan ya fara tunanin yadda zai taimake ni.
He works with her.	Yana aiki da ita.
She was also terrified.	Ita kuma wani abin ya bata tsoro.
I hope you are well with that.	Ina fatan kuna lafiya da hakan.
Maybe you should stop now.	Wataƙila ya kamata ku tsaya yanzu.
I do not know how to stand.	Ban san yadda zan tsaya ba.
One, not much.	Daya, ba yawa.
We are looking for you now, you see.	Muna neman ku yanzu, kun gani.
Never taken one.	Ba a taɓa ɗauka ɗaya ba.
So he did something.	Don haka ya yi wani abu.
One feeling is enough.	Ji daya ya isa.
And they told it.	Kuma suka yi labarin.
He told me to say so.	Ya ce in ce haka.
Who would have thought so, all the money and everything.	Wanene zai yi tunanin haka, duk kuɗin da komai.
It's hard.	Yana da wuya.
No one really cared.	Babu wanda ya kula sosai.
Join with him.	Shiga tare da shi.
If he does, he will probably make a mistake.	Idan ya yi, tabbas za a yi kuskure.
He has this.	Ya na da wannan.
He just knew he would succeed.	Ya san kawai zai yi nasara.
I want to make you suffer.	Na so in sa ku wahala.
He was alive.	Ya kasance mai rai.
It is generally accepted.	An yarda gaba ɗaya.
We like what we don’t have.	Muna son abin da ba mu da shi.
And he is not alone.	Kuma ba shi kaɗai ba.
It is the food we eat.	Abincin da muke ci ne.
He opened another.	Ya bude wani.
Walk in a cool place and drink plenty of water.	Yi tafiya a wuri mai sanyi kuma ku sha ruwa mai yawa.
He was not happy about that.	Bai yi farin ciki da hakan ba.
Not often, however.	Ba sau da yawa, duk da haka.
How are you.	Yaya ku.
The opportunity is not good.	Damar ba ta da kyau.
He entered.	Ya shiga.
It is a big mistake.	Babban kuskure ne.
On the third attempt.	A kan ƙoƙari na uku.
First, it is very hot here.	Na farko, yana da zafi sosai a nan.
In fact, he did.	A gaskiya, ya yi.
This method works well.	Wannan hanyar tana aiki lafiya.
If you don’t like what you see, we’ll go.	Idan ba ku son abin da kuke gani, za mu tafi.
And still not enough.	Kuma har yanzu bai isa ba.
They know they are being watched.	Sun san ana kallon su.
The last two do not contradict each other.	Ƙarshe biyu ba sa cin karo da juna.
Sometimes for good, some are not good.	Wani lokaci don mai kyau, wasu ba su da kyau.
Last night, we decided to go to the movies.	A daren jiya, mun yanke shawarar zuwa fim.
He got up empty-handed.	Ya tashi babu komai.
Now it seems the problem is gone.	Yanzu da alama matsalar ta tafi.
Surprisingly it doesn’t work.	Abin mamaki ba ya aiki.
He is a talkative man.	Mutum ne mai yawan magana.
They soon realized that it was a difficult task.	Nan da nan suka gane cewa aiki ne mai wuya.
I have a hard time with this kind of thing.	Ina da matukar wahala da irin wannan abu.
I just touched it inside.	Kawai na taba shi a ciki.
It has been a long journey, some say.	Ya dade da tafiya, wasu sun ce.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
The man spoke again.	Mutumin ya sake magana.
He was.	Ya kasance.
Now it makes them cry.	Yanzu ya sa su kuka.
This book will make you laugh until you cry over and over again.	Wannan littafin zai baka dariya har sai kun yi kuka sau da yawa.
Sometimes you are treated well just because you are known.	Wani lokaci ana yi maka da kyau don kawai an san ka.
I want to return to the story you are telling.	Ina so in koma ga labarin da kuke fada.
Don’t stop, it’s not like that.	Kar ku daina, ba irin wannan ba.
I can get it at any time.	Zan iya samun shi a kowane lokaci.
Maybe I made a mistake.	Wataƙila na yi kuskure.
The door is open.	K'ofar ta bud'e.
We must accept.	Dole ne mu yarda.
It's almost two.	Kusan biyu ne.
I have been thinking of you for a long time.	Na dade ina tunanin ku.
I did not succeed.	Ban ci nasara ba.
Many people use this method to get pregnant after years of suffering.	Mutane da yawa suna amfani da wannan hanyar don yin ciki bayan shekaru na wahala.
Seriously, we have a hand in it.	Da gaske, muna da hannu a kai.
It is not loud in any way.	Ba a yi kara ba ta kowace hanya.
I love it very, very much.	Ina son shi sosai da sosai.
Think for a moment.	Ka yi tunani na ɗan lokaci.
Maybe we will get more rain tomorrow.	Wataƙila za mu sami ƙarin ruwan sama gobe.
He thought it was funny.	Ya dauka abin ban dariya ne.
He is not well here.	Ba shi da lafiya a nan.
You do everything you should.	Kuna yin duk abin da ya kamata ku yi.
She is playful.	Tana da wasa.
She started home.	Ta fara gida.
But it gives me a chance.	Amma yana ba ni dama.
It's so amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki sosai.
If you do not, try again two.	Idan ba ku yi ba, kun sake gwada ɗaukar biyu.
You never do that.	Ba ka taba yin haka ba.
The news was positive.	Labarin ya kasance mai daɗi.
No doubt they were upset.	Babu shakka sun damu.
For one thing, work now takes place three times a week.	Abu ɗaya, yanzu aiki yana faruwa sau uku a mako.
This is the desired end.	Wannan shine karshen da ake so.
It seems to be.	Da alama ya kasance.
I will not kill her as she killed me.	Ba zan kashe ta ba kamar yadda ta kashe ni.
I can use one.	Zan iya amfani da daya.
He decided to try the water a little harder.	Ya yanke shawarar gwada ruwan kadan kadan.
I’m not local, though.	Ba na gida ba ne, ko da yake.
It is a way of time.	Hanya ce ta lokaci.
Honestly, there are a lot of things going on.	Gaskiya, akwai abubuwa da yawa da ke faruwa.
The sun rose slowly.	Rana ta tashi a hankali.
This is a good sign.	Wannan alama ce mai kyau.
It's a sweet thing.	Shi abu ne mai dadi.
But they worked.	Amma sun yi aiki.
But there are skeptics.	Amma akwai masu shakka.
You should go back.	Ya kamata ku koma.
But we don't care about that here.	Amma ba mu damu da hakan a nan ba.
But it does not have to be accurate.	Amma ba lallai ne ya zama daidai ba.
And that won't work.	Kuma hakan ba zai yi aiki ba.
The final problem is us.	Matsala ta ƙarshe kuma ita ce mu.
But every day, there are things that cannot be explained.	Amma a kowace rana, akwai abubuwan da ba za a iya bayyana su ba.
So he wrote it by hand.	Don haka ya rubuta shi da hannu.
Money, one thing.	Kudi, abu ɗaya.
Since then we have made a lot of progress.	Tun daga nan mun sami ci gaba da yawa.
She wondered if he would let her stay.	Ta yi tunanin ko zai bar ta ta zauna.
Some surprises along the way.	Wasu abubuwan mamaki a hanya.
I tried to do well.	Na yi ƙoƙari na yi kyau.
He enters.	Yana shiga.
Good, look.	Yayi kyau, kama.
They are children.	Yara ne.
She got this from you.	Ta samu wannan daga gare ku.
I did not expect that to happen.	Ban yi tsammanin hakan zai faru ba.
It's not good.	Bai yi kyau ba.
Kids love it.	Yara suna son shi.
We are not all successful.	Ba mu duka ba ne masu nasara.
We do not accept this.	Ba mu yarda da wannan ba.
I am very sad.	Ina bakin ciki sosai.
Fast.	Mai sauri.
He knew he could do it.	Ya san zai iya yin hakan.
Fortunately, this is nothing new.	Abin farin ciki, wannan ba sabon abu ba ne.
This makes him sad.	Hakan yana bata masa rai.
And the same thing happens in real life.	Kuma irin wannan ya faru a rayuwa ta gaske.
I don't really think so.	Ba da gaske nake tunani sosai ba.
Everything has changed.	Komai ya canza.
He was on the ground once, however.	Ya kasance a kasa sau ɗaya, duk da haka.
In fact it is even harder.	A gaskiya ya fi haka wuya.
But that is not right.	Amma hakan ba daidai ba ne.
But the need is there.	Amma bukatar tana nan.
She got a real name.	Ta samu sunan gaskiya.
That is what makes them successful.	Abin da ke sa su yi nasara kenan.
Maybe that would be better.	Wataƙila hakan zai fi kyau.
It does not.	Ba ya yi.
We are not happy at all.	Mu ba mu da daɗi ko kaɗan.
I bought a car	Na sayi mota
Without it, he would get nothing.	Idan ba tare da shi ba, ba zai sami komai ba.
And it will not be.	Kuma ba zai kasance ba.
I come from one.	Na zo daga daya.
Just to show me.	Kawai don nuna min.
Another man died.	Wani mutum ya mutu.
He really did.	Ya yi da gaske.
Not everyone is interested.	Ba sha'awar kowa ba.
I know you will.	Na san za ku yi.
She started laughing.	Ta fara dariya.
You will understand why.	Za ku gane dalilin.
The children are crying.	Yara suna kuka.
Or wait.	Ko jira.
I think we arrived.	Ina tsammanin mun isa.
Putting forward is necessary.	Ajiye gaba ya zama dole.
I know how it is.	Na san yadda take.
Like you.	Kamar ku.
Start with just one session at a time.	Fara kawai da lokaci ɗaya a lokaci guda.
I don’t want to get into that.	Ba na son shiga cikin wannan.
It works right for me.	Yana aiki daidai a gare ni.
And maybe he was right.	Kuma watakila ya yi gaskiya.
But that never happened.	Amma, hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
He didn’t even confirm my time.	Bai ma tabbatar da lokacin nawa ba.
But tonight, you don't stop working.	Amma a daren yau, ba ku daina aiki.
I want to finish early.	Ina so in gama da wuri.
Be the best.	Kasance wanda ya fi kyau.
He got it at the time.	Ya samu a lokacin.
This book is not true.	Wannan littafin ba gaskiya bane.
I really like it.	Na yi so sosai.
She was surprised.	Ta yi mamaki.
You know what's out there.	Kun san abin da ke can.
You have to look at yourself.	Dole ne ku kalli kanku.
This is not an easy fix.	Wannan ba gyara ba ne mai sauƙi.
There are not many opportunities to work here.	Babu dama da yawa don aiki a nan.
Do not add.	Kar ka kara cewa.
They were right.	Sun yi daidai.
But it was never right.	Amma bai taba zama daidai ba.
He died years and years later.	Ya mutu shekara da shekaru.
She could not sit much.	Ta kasa zama da yawa.
He did this during the meal.	Ya yi haka a lokacin cin abinci.
Sometimes what's on your head, like.	Wani lokaci abin da ke cikin kan ku, kamar.
I do not want children anymore.	Ba na son kuma yara.
It is difficult to know exactly where he is.	Yana da wuya a san ainihin inda yake.
He is sick.	Ba shi da lafiya.
The place is close to her.	Wurin yana kusa da ita.
Doing what he wants to do.	Yin abin da yake so ya yi.
And, of course, it's true.	Kuma, tabbas yana da gaskiya.
Children are growing faster than ever.	Yara suna girma cikin sauri fiye da kowane lokaci.
She is tired of waiting.	Ta gaji da jira.
Maybe it's a mistake.	Wataƙila kuskure ne.
You want her to love you.	Ka so ta son ta son ta.
Write them down again.	Rubuta su kuma.
I know it's useful, but.	Na san hakan yana da amfani, amma.
Three of the latter were killed instantly.	An kashe uku daga cikin na karshen nan take.
It has been hot here most of the year.	Ya kasance zafi a nan mafi yawan shekara.
I think they can do that.	Ina tsammanin za su iya yin hakan.
I don't think anyone can.	Bana jin wani zai iya.
I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.	Ba ni da abin da zan rasa kuma duk abin da zan samu.
Pay attention.	Kula da hankali.
I feel pain.	Na ji zafi.
Flee	Gudu
That's what we really are here for.	Abin da muke da gaske a nan ke nan.
It is still small.	Har yanzu kadan ne.
It's done, how.	An yi, ta yaya.
You need to make sure you have everything.	Ya kamata ku tabbata kuna da komai.
We both heard someone in the house.	Mu biyu muka ji wani a gidan.
But the main thing is time.	Amma babban abu shine lokaci.
To write so is nothing.	Don rubuta haka ba wani abu ba ne.
And even if there is, look the other way.	Kuma ko da akwai, duba ta hanya.
But nothing happened.	Amma babu abin da ya faru.
Honestly, let me help you.	A gaskiya, bari in taimake ku.
Many incidents in the past have highlighted the need for reform.	Abubuwan da suka faru da yawa a baya sun nuna bukatar yin gyara.
Sometimes they like what they see, sometimes they don’t.	Wani lokaci suna son abin da suke gani, wani lokacin ba sa so.
Maybe she didn’t know how to refuse.	Watakila ba ta san yadda za ta ƙi ba.
Take time to think about it.	Dauki lokaci don tunani game da hakan.
There is so much white.	Akwai farin da yawa.
They are so beautiful.	Suna da kyau sosai.
He sees it now.	Ya ga haka yanzu.
Seriously, come back with me now.	Da gaske, ka dawo tare da ni yanzu.
He decided he needed more work.	Ya yanke shawarar yana buƙatar ƙarin aiki.
That can't really be done right now.	Ba za a iya yin hakan da gaske ba a yanzu.
Do not write that.	Kar a rubuta hakan.
Enjoy yourself and meet someone new.	Yi wa kanku dadi kuma ku hadu da wani sabon.
I'm trying to stay here.	Ina ƙoƙarin zama a nan.
One of us has to speak!	Dole daya daga cikin mu yayi magana!
They don't like you.	Ba sa son ku.
No, that is not true.	A'a, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
There he waited.	Can ya jira.
But she didn't care.	Amma bata damu ba.
It will take more work.	Zai ɗauki ƙarin aiki.
Not surprising but good enough.	Ba abin mamaki ba amma mai kyau isa.
I was happy with this car.	Na yi farin ciki da wannan motar.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Think very carefully.	Yi tunani a hankali sosai.
You will not be forgotten.	Ba za ku manta da ku ba.
You are not allowed to do this.	Ba a ba ku damar yin wannan ba.
He made a good trip.	Ya yi tafiya mai kyau.
All is not lost.	Duk ba a rasa ba.
I had a cold time there once.	Na yi lokacin sanyi a wurin sau ɗaya.
I did it.	Na yi shi.
If this is amazing, let me explain how it works.	Idan wannan yana da ban mamaki, bari in bayyana yadda yake aiki.
We have fresh water.	Muna da ruwa mai dadi.
A child who has not reached his age.	Yaro wanda bai kai kansa ba.
So, tell me about yourself.	Don haka, gaya mani game da kanku.
However, not everyone agrees.	Duk da haka, ba kowa ya yarda ba.
But, please, do not tell anyone.	Amma, don Allah, kar a gaya wa kowa.
Time is of the essence.	Lokaci yana da wuya.
Read on for more.	Karanta don ƙarin.
She will wait.	Zata jira.
Any job is better than no job.	Duk wani aiki ya fi babu aiki.
He seems to know what to do.	Da alama ya san me zai yi.
She is crying.	Tana kuka.
Let's pass.	Mu wuce.
They hope because they want to, and maybe because they need to.	Suna fata saboda suna so, kuma watakila saboda suna bukata.
I think it is true.	Ina ganin gaskiya ne.
We are not even talking anymore.	Ba mu ma kan magana kuma.
I feel it.	Ina jin shi.
It's easy.	Yana da sauƙi.
Anyone who can see the dog is here.	Duk wanda zai iya ganin kare yana nan.
He seems to be planning a trip somewhere.	Da alama yana shirin tafiya wani wuri.
I eat what makes me happy and healthy.	Ina cin abin da ke sa ni farin ciki da lafiya.
I want you to talk to me.	Ina so ku yi min magana.
No one should know.	Babu wanda ya kamata ya sani.
And we are.	Kuma mu ne.
It’s not our favorite of the day.	Ba abin da muka fi so na ranar ba ne.
Work is more than waiting.	Aiki ya fi jira.
He took us there.	Ya kai mu can.
I think you will be fine.	Ina tsammanin za ku kasance lafiya.
There is no way to do it all.	Babu yadda za a yi da shi duka.
It's funny.	Abin dariya ne.
The work.	Aikin.
It can go on and on.	Zai iya ci gaba.
He had time.	Ya samu lokaci.
And in that, it's the last word.	Kuma a cikin wannan, yana da magana ta ƙarshe.
We won the day.	Mun ci nasara ranar.
Not stupid, you might think.	Ba rashin hankali ba, kuna iya tunani.
I'm so, so sorry.	Ina haka, don haka hakuri.
She will look for the goods.	Za ta nemi kayan.
More on that tomorrow.	Da yawa akan wannan gobe.
It is fair to say, it does not happen.	Yana da kyau a ce, ba ya faruwa.
To the delight of everyone, the project was a success.	Don jin daɗin kowa, aikin ya yi nasara.
You can not.	Ba za ku iya ba.
You decide how to feel and hear the music.	Kuna yanke shawarar yadda za a ji da jin waƙa.
I filled that place.	Na cika wannan wurin.
And she got it.	Kuma ta samu.
I didn’t mind waiting around.	Ban damu da jira a kusa ba.
They were useful and sold.	Sun kasance da amfani da kuma sayar da su.
Hope you are doing well so far.	Da fatan kuna yin kyau ya zuwa yanzu.
I can't believe it.	Ba zan iya yarda ba.
It is a feeling he knows very well.	Ji ne ya sani sosai.
Do not waste food.	Kar a bata abinci.
But he tested it on other people.	Amma ya gwada hakan akan sauran mutane.
Hope and happiness.	Fata da farin ciki.
She never knew why she was shut down.	Ba ta taba sanin dalilin da yasa aka rufe ta ba.
The door is open.	Kofar a bude take.
This does not work anymore.	Wannan baya aiki kuma.
That can be a problem.	Hakan na iya zama matsala.
Some real time close to each other, yet without.	Wasu ainihin lokaci kusa da juna, duk da haka ba tare.
She is beautiful.	Ta yi kyau.
And you.	Kuma ku.
I found the hard way that this is true.	Na sami hanya mai wuya cewa wannan gaskiya ne.
I will find the truth.	Zan sami gaskiya.
I feel it too.	Ina jin shi ma.
However you can hear.	Duk da haka kuna iya ji.
But you are not serious.	Amma ba da gaske kuke fada ba.
They can even talk to them.	Har ma suna iya magana da su.
She did not understand what was going on.	Bata gane me ke faruwa ba.
He took her.	Ya tafi da ita.
But we can not.	Amma ba za mu iya ba.
He does not like what we do.	Ba ya jin daɗin abin da muke yi.
But try to stay close to find out what you can.	Amma gwada zama kusa da gano abin da za ku iya.
Either way, this is real.	A wata hanya, wannan na gaske ne.
So, they did.	Don haka, sun yi.
It can not be here.	Ba zai iya zama a nan ba.
Show you why the world is better now.	Nuna muku dalilin da yasa duniya ta fi kyau yanzu.
We did not say anything in the car.	Ba mu ce komai a cikin motar ba.
I know you now.	Na san ku yanzu.
No one does it better.	Babu wanda ya fi yin shi.
I still can't believe it.	Har yanzu ba zan iya yarda da shi ba.
You can take it as you wish.	Kuna iya ɗaukar hakan yadda kuke so.
Every year, an exciting festival is held here.	Kowace shekara, ana yin bikin ban sha'awa a nan.
She always wants to protect us.	Kullum tana son ta kare mu.
And with them you will die.	Kuma da su za ku mutu.
We have a dog.	Muna da kare.
You like me or you hate me.	Kuna so ni ko ku ƙi ni.
Time to think.	Lokacin tunani.
He had to speak.	Sai da yayi magana.
I found that in myself.	Na samu hakan a cikin kaina.
Then I said no.	Sai na ce a'a.
I want it.	Ni ne yake so.
It would be totally inappropriate.	Zai kasance gaba ɗaya bai dace ba.
She added them on her head.	Ta kara da su a ka.
I will die	Zan mutu
This coming week will be even better.	Wannan mako mai zuwa zai fi kyau.
It can't be done well.	Ba za a iya yin kyau ba.
And this for me was like, the future.	Kuma wannan a gare ni ya kasance kamar, nan gaba.
In fact, they are too many.	A gaskiya ma, sun yi yawa.
So, it's very exciting.	Don haka, abin farin ciki ne sosai.
One person was killed.	An kashe mutum daya.
Be very careful.	Ku ji tsoro sosai.
And let.	Kuma bari.
Please be sure to check out the article.	Da fatan za a tabbatar kun duba labarin.
I learned that later.	Na koyi hakan daga baya.
She lifted my hand and walked out.	Ta daga min hannu tana fita.
Do not tell others yet.	Kar a gaya wa wasu tukuna.
And he won't talk about it.	Kuma ba zai yi magana a kai ba.
They enjoy growing up.	Suna jin daɗin girma.
This is a lie.	Wannan karya ce.
People are joining.	Mutane suna shiga.
But he did something tonight, which you can not take away from him.	Amma ya yi wani abu a daren nan, wanda ba za ku iya ɗauka daga gare shi ba.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
I have no idea.	Ba ni da wani tunani.
The water supply is fully functional.	Ruwan ruwa ya cika aiki.
That's why we have to work.	Shi ya sa dole mu yi aiki.
They are worried about leaving the house alone.	Sun damu da barin gidan shi kadai.
That said, not all of them.	Wannan ya ce, ba duka ba ne.
Do the same for two things.	Yi hakan abubuwa biyu.
He could not do that.	Ya kasa yin haka.
Save all equipment.	Ajiye duk kayan aiki.
So, you know, it's a big deal.	Don haka, ka sani, babban abu ne.
There is no need to change this.	Babu bukatar canza wannan.
This, even more so.	Wannan, ma fiye da haka.
He does not think so.	Baya tunanin hakan.
It is easy to see why this is so.	Yana da sauƙi a ga dalilin da ya sa haka yake.
As you do.	Kamar yadda kuke yi.
I never believed it.	Ban taba yarda da shi ba.
Nothing was added about it.	Babu wani abu da aka kara cewa game da shi.
Better to say no, she thought.	Gara a ce a'a, ta yi tunani.
Don't think about it yet.	Kar ka yi tunanin hakan tukuna.
Everyone loves it.	Kowa ya so shi.
And stop driving.	Kuma daina tuƙi.
Travel the world one way slowly.	Yi tafiya a duniya ku daya hanya hankali.
To join you.	Don shiga ku.
Maybe even then it will be cold.	Wataƙila ma a lokacin zai yi sanyi.
It will pass.	Zai wuce.
I will protect them.	Zan kare su.
We need to talk to them.	Muna bukatar mu yi magana da su.
She has been in this place in the past.	Ta kasance a wannan wurin a baya.
That has to change.	Wannan dole ya canza.
However it should not work without my knowledge.	Duk da haka bai kamata ya yi aiki ba tare da sani na ba.
I hate such an answer.	Na ƙi irin wannan amsa.
We can not be.	Ba za mu iya zama ba.
But no one can see it.	Amma babu kowa a gani.
He drank a lot, very quickly.	Ya sha da yawa, da sauri.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Look outside.	Duba waje.
They were paid in advance.	An biya su a gaba.
so sweet.	mai dadi haka.
It is thirteen, after all.	Yana da sha uku, bayan duk.
You know what they say.	Kun san abin da suke cewa.
The car is very low.	Motar ta yi kasa sosai.
But many people use it that way.	Amma mutane da yawa suna amfani da shi haka.
I kept going, thinking it would catch on.	Na ci gaba, ina tunanin za ta kama.
They are not here.	Ba su nan.
I was surprised by this answer.	Na yi mamakin wannan amsa.
Few people live there now.	Mutane kaɗan ne suka zauna a wurin yanzu.
Suppose something happened.	A ce wani abu ya faru.
He made a mistake too.	Yayi kuskure kuma.
You can do anything.	Kuna iya yin komai.
This may be the last time we see each other.	Wannan yana iya zama karo na ƙarshe da ma muka ga juna.
This book is recommended.	An ba da shawarar wannan littafin.
It’s hard to get back on track after what happened.	Yana da wuya a dawo kan hanya bayan abin da ya faru.
And then we realized someone was gone.	Kuma sai muka gane wani ya tafi.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
I'm still not convinced.	Har yanzu ba a tabbatar min da kuskure ba.
Just last night.	Kamar daren jiya.
At times, we even get sick.	A wani lokaci, muna yin rashin lafiya.
Please bring your luggage.	Da fatan za a kawo kayan ku.
I decided what was best for me.	Na yanke shawarar abin da ya dace da ni.
We are good.	Muna da kyau.
He called me today.	Ya kira ni yau.
I have to look really good.	Dole ne in yi kama da gaske.
He doesn't like her.	Ba ya son ta.
I'm not even sure it works.	Ban ma tabbata yana aiki ba.
But he did not want that.	Amma bai so hakan ba.
We surprised everyone when we got up and said.	Mun ba kowa mamaki lokacin da muka tashi muka ce.
Be careful when trying these.	Yi hankali lokacin gwada waɗannan.
As it is written, he did not feel like the first man.	Yadda aka rubuta wannan, bai ji kamar mutum na farko ba.
This is a real thing.	Wannan abu ne na gaske.
So of course this is your problem.	Don haka tabbas wannan shine matsalar ku.
We do not need.	Ba mu bukata.
I told him to leave me alone.	Na ce masa ya bar ni ni kadai.
It's easy !.	Yana da sauƙi!.
He showed great interest in me.	Ya nuna sha'awa sosai a kaina.
It's just true.	Gaskiya ne kawai.
I can do well.	Zan iya yin kyau.
This is the place.	Wannan shi ne wurin.
But we will recognize it.	Amma za mu gane shi.
But there is no work to do.	Amma babu wani aikin yin haka.
It looks like my age.	Ya yi kama da shekaru na.
He said to call if he could give you any help.	Ya ce a kira idan zai iya ba ka wani taimako.
Nothing, however.	Ba komai, duk da haka.
First, he reads.	Da farko, yana karatu.
You must be.	Dole ne ku kasance.
So, you know, it started to happen.	Don haka, ka sani, ya fara faruwa.
The last time that happened could not be imagined.	Ba za a iya tunanin lokaci na ƙarshe da ya faru ba.
We are here, so give us time.	Muna nan, don haka a ba mu lokaci.
Maybe they were right.	Wataƙila sun yi gaskiya.
So it was.	Don haka ya kasance.
I used to do that.	Na kasance ina yin hakan.
I would highly recommend her !.	Zan ba ta shawarar sosai!.
Maybe there is something to this idea.	Wataƙila akwai wani abu ga wannan tunanin.
None were touched.	Ba a taɓa ko ɗaya ba.
I look down and see how much they are.	Ina kallon kasa na ga nawa haka suke.
With you.	Da kai.
We did everything right.	Mun yi komai daidai.
But there is more work ahead.	Amma akwai sauran aiki a gaba.
It is growing rapidly.	Tana girma cikin sauri.
So, they agreed to pay a fine.	Don haka, sun yarda su biya kuɗi.
Thirty years later.	Bayan shekaru talatin.
He returned and sat down.	Ya koma ya zauna.
She has an idea.	Ta na da wani tunani.
Some people will like this.	Wasu mutane za su so wannan.
You have never seen her.	Ba ka taba ganin ta ba.
But there it is, there is no running with it.	Amma akwai shi, babu gudu da shi.
I like work	Ina son aiki
Somehow, he got something.	Ko ta yaya, ya sami wani abu.
She is good at being selfish.	Tana da kyau ta zama mai son kai.
Rejoice that he is dead.	Yi farin ciki cewa ya mutu.
They are the last ones to go.	Su ne na ƙarshe da suka tafi.
He did not care for them.	Bai kula su ba.
One person.	Mutum daya.
This tool is very interesting to play.	Wannan kayan aikin yana da ban sha'awa sosai don wasa.
Maybe there’s something bigger at work.	Wataƙila akwai wani abu mafi girma a wurin aiki.
I don't care what anyone else says.	Ban damu da me wani zai ce ba.
Everything is calm.	Komai a hankali yake.
You too are very good.	Ku ma kun yi kyau sosai.
Home is home.	Gida gida ne.
It's an amazing game.	Wasa ce mai ban mamaki.
It's funny.	Abin ban dariya ne.
Maybe we’ll go next time.	Wataƙila za mu tafi lokaci na gaba.
Weeping.	Kuka take.
But don’t stop talking here.	Amma kar a tsaya magana a nan.
Someone should do something about it.	Ya kamata wani ya yi wani abu game da hakan.
The water stopped flowing.	Ruwan ya tsaya.
But it's good.	Amma yana da kyau.
We have shown this before.	Mun nuna hakan a baya.
What you say.	Abin da kuka ce.
I didn't do that well.	Ban yi haka da kyau ba.
I hope there is a better way to do this.	Ina fatan akwai hanya mafi kyau ta yin wannan.
They do not know.	Sun kasa sani.
It's our story.	Labarin mu ne.
It should be inside.	Ya kamata a ciki.
He said it was good.	Ya ce, yana da kyau.
The book did not come to her.	Da littafin bai zo mata ba.
One by water.	Daya ta ruwa.
It comes close to what it really is.	Yana zuwa kusa da abin da yake da gaske.
But maybe you have too.	Amma watakila kana da ma.
I've been saving this for a long time but we can't turn it off again.	Na dade ina ajiye wannan amma ba za mu iya sake kashe shi ba.
He quickly agreed.	Da sauri ya yarda.
It felt really good.	Ya ji dadi sosai.
How, it can be seen otherwise.	Ta yaya, za a iya gani in ba haka ba.
You will not die.	Ba za ku mutu ba.
He should get this, though.	Ya kamata ya sami wannan, ko da yake.
She was a tool.	Ta kasance kayan aiki.
A way to see who can play.	Hanyar ganin wanda zai iya wasa.
You better get back quickly.	Ka yi kyau ka dawo da sauri.
You feel what you see.	Kuna jin abin da kuke gani.
We will be very careful.	Za mu yi hankali sosai.
But that is not true.	Amma hakan ba gaskiya ba ne.
And that's enough.	Kuma wannan ya isa.
I still think about it.	Har yanzu ina tunani game da shi.
Together we fight back.	Tare muna fada da baya.
It can be anything.	Yana iya zama komai.
Nothing good will ever happen to them.	Babu wani abu mai kyau da zai taɓa faruwa da su.
Second job.	Aiki na biyu.
And that left me with nothing.	Kuma hakan ya bar ni da komai.
Whether this occurs in humans is unknown.	Ko wannan yana faruwa a cikin mutane ba a sani ba.
From the beginning.	Tun daga farko.
Since I have not returned.	Tun ban dawo ba.
They do not know what will happen.	Ba su san abin da zai faru ba.
I like to think about these.	Ina son yin tunani game da waɗannan.
I will leave.	Zan fita.
It takes effort.	Yana buƙatar ƙoƙari.
He made me laugh.	Ya bani dariya.
Some amazing things can happen on this trip.	Wasu abubuwa masu ban mamaki na iya faruwa a wannan tafiya.
No, it doesn't hurt that much.	A'a, bai yi zafi haka ba.
Finally, she decided to try another method.	A ƙarshe, ta yanke shawarar gwada wata hanya.
If something goes wrong, can you tell me?	Idan wani abu ba daidai ba, za ku iya gaya mani?
I made it to work here.	Na yi shi don yin aiki a nan.
You know what they can do, and what they have done.	Kun san abin da za su iya yi, da abin da suka yi.
He knows exactly what he is doing.	Ya san ainihin abin da yake yi.
She is not working hard.	Ba ta yin aiki da hankali.
I'm not interested in going out with anyone.	Bana sha'awar fita da kowa.
We will continue to do so.	Za mu ci gaba da yin haka.
They did not touch me.	Ba su taba ni ba.
Thought cannot succeed.	Tunanin ba zai iya yin nasara ba.
But we heard nothing.	Amma ba mu ji komai.
Make time.	Yi lokaci.
Not us, not them.	Ba mu ba, ba su ba.
She too will learn to fly.	Ita ma za ta koyi tashi.
You need it more than anyone.	Kuna buƙatar shi fiye da kowa.
She finished her homework.	Ta gama aikin gida.
I do not need to stay.	Bana bukatar in zauna.
Others have lost, like me.	Wasu kuma sun rasa, kamar ni.
They realize they are not alone.	Sun gane ba su kadai ba.
Let this place be.	Bari wannan wuri ya kasance.
Otherwise he went.	In ba haka ba ya tafi.
We got that too.	Mu ma mun samu hakan.
Imagine if they did.	Ka yi tunanin idan sun yi.
What he did.	Abin da ya yi.
Now is a good time like any other.	Yanzu lokaci ne mai kyau kamar kowane.
Walk every day, every way.	Yi tafiya a kowace rana, ta kowace hanya.
It's scary.	Abu ne mai ban tsoro.
What more?	Ƙarin menene?
This is our end.	Wannan shine karshen mu.
They will say no.	Za su ce a'a.
The opportunity came and they took it.	Damar ta zo suka dauka.
But this must be done.	Amma wannan dole ne a yi.
I love it when we drive at night.	Ina son shi lokacin da muke tuƙi da dare.
Something will help for a while, until it does.	Wani abu zai taimaka na ɗan lokaci, har sai bai yi ba.
I can't call.	Ba zan iya kira ba.
But that desire was rejected.	Amma wannan sha'awar ya ƙi.
She felt like she was thinking again.	Ta ji kamar ta sake tunani.
I did it again.	Na sake yin hakan.
I don't believe he can do that to me.	Ban yarda zai iya yi min haka ba.
Something will happen.	Wani abu zai faru.
She became even more frustrated.	Ta kara bata rai.
Why did you leave home when you did.	Me ya sa kuka bar gida lokacin da kuka yi.
That's what it says there.	Abin da yake cewa a can ke nan.
That's right.	Daidai ne.
That's right.	Hakan ya dace.
Or for money.	Ko don kudi.
I must have missed something.	Dole ne in rasa wani abu.
It is common, not a few.	Na kowa ne, ba 'yan kaɗan ba.
This is also interesting.	Hakan ma abin sha'awa ne.
He is in a car.	Yana cikin mota.
You are only testing yourself.	Kuna gwada kanku kawai.
In the end, the players covered you.	A ƙarshe, 'yan wasa sun rufe ku.
Look forward to the last day!	Kula da ranar ƙarshe!
Kids are having a hard time right now.	Yara suna da wahala a yanzu.
But things cannot go that way.	Amma abubuwa ba za su iya tafiya haka ba.
She said.	Ta ce.
Not surprisingly, the man became ill again.	Ba mamaki mutumin ya sake yin rashin lafiya.
This work was too much to bear on my own.	Wannan aikin ya kasance mai yawa don ɗauka da kaina.
This is a very absurd statement.	Wannan magana ce mafi rashin hankali.
I am here for this.	Ina nan don wannan.
You can just change it.	Kuna iya canza shi kawai.
You have never eaten.	Ba ku taɓa cin abinci ba.
We must think carefully.	Dole ne mu yi tunani sosai.
And it will never be.	Kuma ba zai taba zama ba.
She never did.	Ba ta taba haka ba.
But he won’t do it right away.	Amma ba zai yi ba nan da nan.
Don't give up.	Kar a bari.
Don't worry, it's nothing.	Kar ku damu, ba komai ba ne.
He gave them money again.	Ya sake ba su kudi.
She decides not to tell him.	Ta yanke shawarar kada ta gaya masa.
But it can be.	Amma yana iya zama.
If you live here you will know that.	Idan kana zaune a nan za ka san haka.
There is nothing new in this.	Babu wani sabon abu a cikin wannan.
The sun rose with wonder.	Rana ta tashi da ban mamaki.
Honestly I don't know how to fix that.	Gaskiya ban san yadda zan gyara hakan ba.
They take them somewhere.	Suna kai su wani wuri.
No, she would not.	A'a, ba za ta yi ba.
I want to know.	Ina so in sani.
Not sure where to start.	Ban tabbata ta ina zan fara ba.
You are doing a great job !.	Kuna yin babban aiki!.
I'm dead	Na mutu
I can find out by that.	Zan iya gano ta hakan.
Every night of the week.	Kowane dare na mako.
I think.	Ina ji.
Probably my favorite book of all time.	Wataƙila littafin da na fi so na kowane lokaci.
Not here, not here.	Ba a nan ba, ba a nan ba.
I will never.	Ba zan taba ba.
They have to go in and out every day.	Dole ne su shiga su fita kowace rana.
But nothing happened.	Amma ba abin da ya faru.
And yet it is the only way.	Kuma duk da haka ita ce kawai hanya.
But she didn't get it.	Amma ba ta samu ba.
I think it's in the water nearby.	Ina tsammanin yana cikin ruwa kusa da nan.
You must know how to do it.	Dole ne ku san yadda za ku yi.
They are finished.	An gama su.
But I can't make it work.	Amma ba zan iya sanya shi aiki ba.
We love it there, and we think it will be fun.	Muna son shi a can, kuma muna tunanin zai zama abin farin ciki.
He is tired of being alone.	Ya gaji da zama shi kadai.
And you can not hear me.	Kuma ba za ka iya ji na.
She doesn't feel that way either.	Ita ma bata jin haka.
He didn’t care about anything, of course.	Bai damu da komai ba, tabbas.
He walks with me.	Yana tafiya da ni.
She passed quickly.	Ta wuce da sauri.
You will not be able to recognize it.	Ba za ku iya gane shi ba.
You can use it too.	Kuna iya amfani da ita ma.
They will have a wonderful life.	Za su sami rayuwa mai ban sha'awa.
Walk now.	Yi tafiya a yanzu.
I hope you understand.	Ina fatan kun gane.
What is the name of this thing?	Menene sunan wannan abu?
I understand what they can do.	Na fahimci abin da za su iya yi.
I live a good life.	Ina yin rayuwa mai kyau.
Let's go there.	Can mu tafi.
Do your homework.	Yi aikin gida.
It will continue, even if you do not.	Za ta ci gaba, ko da ba ka yi ba.
I can't just read this.	Ba zan iya karanta wannan kawai ba.
And mine, well, mine is very good.	Kuma nawa, da kyau, nawa yayi kyau sosai.
It helps me a lot at night.	Yana taimaka min cikin dare sosai.
It feels like it.	Ji yake kamar shi.
Maybe this trip will help you grow.	Wataƙila wannan tafiya zai taimake ku girma.
Therefore, it is used in general.	Saboda haka, ana amfani da shi gaba ɗaya.
No child would say that.	Babu yaro da zai ce haka.
But that is what they are thinking.	Amma abin da suke tunani ke nan.
We'll see what happens.	Za mu ga abin da ya faru.
It is indeed sad.	Lallai abin bakin ciki ne .
He did not expect that.	Bai yi tsammanin haka ba.
I have no such thoughts.	Ba ni da irin wannan tunanin.
This is not a difficult thing or something new.	Wannan ba abu ba ne mai wuya ko sabon abu.
It will be the first.	Zai zama na farko.
I like that.	Ina son abin.
It happened on.	Ya faru a.
Try them for a while.	Gwada su na ɗan lokaci.
I will be here.	Zan kasance a nan.
He saw what was there.	Ya ga abin da ke wurin.
I do not want to be anyone.	Bana son zama wani.
You are happy.	Kun sami farin ciki.
But you know how it is.	Amma kun san yadda abin yake.
And it really works.	Kuma da gaske yana aiki.
You’re talking about something else now.	Kuna magana akan wani abu kuma yanzu.
Maybe two things happened.	Wataƙila abubuwa biyu sun faru.
No one is going to die.	Babu wanda zai mutu.
They would have continued to do so.	Da sun ci gaba da haka.
They recognize her now.	Sun gane ta a yanzu.
So, well.	Don haka, da kyau.
She adjusted her seat.	Ta gyara zama.
But that is not the whole story.	Amma ba wannan ba ne duka labarin.
People were killed and many more were killed.	An kashe mutane kuma an kusan kashe mutane da yawa.
Do not do this thing.	Kar a yi wannan abu.
This is not the best thing.	Wannan ba shine mafi kyawun abu ba.
This is not a bad thing.	Wannan ba mummunan abu ba ne.
A few years.	Shekaru kadan.
He could not do anything about the upstairs room.	Bai iya yin komai ba game da dakin da ke sama.
She can imagine what she wants to happen.	Zai iya tunanin abin da take so ya faru.
They're just sleeping. '	Suna barci kawai'.
Nothing to do.	Babu wani abin yi.
Just give me time.	Kawai a ba ni lokaci.
The police checked him.	'Yan sanda sun duba shi.
They want me here.	Suna so ni a nan.
I'm not sure if it will work or not.	Ban tabbata ba ko zai yi aiki ko a'a.
However again this did not work.	Duk da haka kuma wannan bai yi amfani ba.
I became myself early.	Na zama kaina da wuri.
For just this moment.	Don kawai wannan lokacin.
We laughed more.	Muka kara dariya.
Still early yet.	Har yanzu da wuri tukuna.
He loves you.	Yana son ku.
That time is over.	Wannan lokacin ya wuce.
I hope you understand !.	Ina fatan kun gane!.
They too are tired.	Su ma sun gaji.
It's delicious.	Yana da daɗi.
I did not hear it.	Ban ji shi ba.
I don't think he will sell it.	Ba na jin zai sayar da shi.
She made them work.	Ta sanya su aiki.
So they didn't get that.	Don haka ba su samu hakan ba.
Your approach has been positive.	Hanyar ku ta zama mai kyau.
She sees no use.	Ta ga babu amfani.
Not a good ending.	Ba kyakkyawan ƙarshe bane.
She felt fine there.	Ta ji lafiya a wurin.
This is a little difficult.	Wannan ya ɗan yi wahala.
I am human now.	Ni mutum ne yanzu.
One size really does not fit all.	Girma ɗaya da gaske bai dace da duka ba.
And it's so in that.	Kuma yana da haka a cikin wannan.
I applied for a job but could not find one.	Na nemi aiki amma ban samu aiki ba.
So here's your story.	Don haka akwai labarin ku.
I will tell you about it later.	Zan gaya muku game da shi a gaba.
Sometimes this is the only thing that helps.	Wani lokaci wannan shine kawai abin da ya taimaka.
You make me laugh.	Kuna bani dariya.
It still is, in fact.	Har yanzu yana, a gaskiya.
We may never know for sure.	Wataƙila ba za mu taɓa sanin tabbas ba.
This is just about everyone.	Wannan kawai game da kowa.
He can't smoke now.	Ba zai iya shan taba yanzu ba.
I do not know what.	Ban san menene ba.
This is a good place.	Wannan wuri ne mai kyau.
I hear you're done.	Na ji kun gama aiki.
Every little help.	Kowane ɗan taimako.
There is a time to talk later.	Akwai lokacin magana daga baya.
The water here is amazing.	Ruwan da ke nan ya yi ban mamaki.
Every home has these.	Kowane gida yana da waɗannan.
It happened.	Ya faru.
You will know.	Za ku sani.
I did not sleep.	Ban yi barci ba.
You are almost right.	Kusan tabbas kun yi gaskiya.
He worked most of the time.	Ya yi aiki mafi yawan lokaci.
Although not me.	Ko da yake ba ni ba.
I find this every day.	Ina gano wannan kowace rana.
I want to see how you are.	Ina so in ga yadda kuke.
That's a lot of money.	Wannan kudi ne mai yawa.
It still seems unprepared.	Da alama har yanzu ba a shirya ba tukuna.
Everything she sees is next.	Duk abin da ta gani sai mai zuwa.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Gara ta kula.
This is the best thing.	Wannan shine mafi kyawun abu.
And again, they are right.	Kuma kuma, suna da gaskiya.
However, we must start somewhere.	Duk da haka, dole ne mu fara wani wuri.
I don't want too much.	Ba na so da yawa.
None of it.	Babu ko ɗaya daga ciki.
Kids will love it!	Yara za su so shi!
We love it.	Muna son shi.
I am giving this story myself.	Ina ba da wannan labarin da kaina.
They are like.	Kamar su ne.
She went the right way.	Ta tafi daidai hanyar.
No one knows for sure.	Babu wanda ya san tabbas.
The ship arrived safely at the port.	Jirgin ya isa tashar ruwa lafiya.
That's it.	Haka ya fito.
It will not be used.	Ba za a yi amfani da shi ba.
He wrote himself.	Da kansa ya rubuta.
That would be nice.	Da hakan yayi kyau.
It was then that he realized.	Sai a lokacin ya gane.
Fearlessness lives in it.	Rashin tsoro yana rayuwa a ciki.
He was amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
We are not going to take any work there.	Ba za mu dauki wani aiki a can ba.
Apply it this way.	Sanya shi ta wannan hanyar.
She decided to try a new diet.	Ta yanke shawarar gwada sabon abinci.
You are a human being.	Kai mutum ne.
I can't talk to him.	Ba zan iya magana da shi ba.
I was very happy.	Na yi farin ciki sosai.
There is truth to this, and this is not a problem.	Akwai gaskiya a kan hakan, kuma wannan ba matsala ba ne.
Everything you said is true.	Duk abin da ka fada gaskiya ne.
She is also there.	Ita ma tana can.
It worked again.	Ya yi aiki kuma.
Bring them back.	Ka dawo da su.
There is nothing strange.	Babu wani abu mai ban mamaki.
I’ve never done it myself.	Ban taba yi da kaina ba.
They will talk.	Za su yi magana.
You put me in place now.	Kuna sanya ni a wuri a yanzu.
She spoke slowly.	Ta fad'a a hankali.
Faster than you think.	Da wuri fiye da yadda kuke tunani.
It's hard for him.	Yana da wuya a gare shi.
Time is running out.	Lokaci ya yi gudu.
It's smart.	Hankali ne.
Or we may not think so.	Ko ba ma tunanin gani kawai.
What did they do wrong?	Me suka yi kuskure?
I wrote about it.	Na rubuta game da shi.
I can't wait to read the rest of this.	Ba zan iya jira in karanta sauran wannan ba.
Not once, she has never complained about me.	Ba sau ɗaya ba, ba ta taɓa yin kuka game da ni ba.
Coffee is served in the morning.	Akan sha kofi da safe.
He remembered nothing.	Bai tuna komai ba.
How to do certain things and if.	Yadda ake yin wasu abubuwa da idan.
All because of you.	Duk saboda ku ne.
You do too much, you try early.	Kun yi yawa, kun gwada da wuri.
But now you know.	Amma yanzu kun sani.
I did not miss her.	Ban rasa ta ba.
The rest of us will just do it.	Sauran mu za mu yi kawai.
That was the first thing that surprised him.	Abin da ya fara ba shi mamaki ke nan.
I don't feel sick.	Ba na jin kamar rashin lafiya.
Such a response was astonishing.	Irin wannan amsa ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
I'm getting right.	Ina shiga daidai.
That day paid off.	Wannan rana ta biya.
He could see nothing.	Bai iya ganin komai ba.
I did not do it.	Ban yi ta ba.
He was a little worried about the rain.	Ya dan damu da ruwan sama.
I want to give this to other people.	Ina so in ba da wannan ga sauran mutane.
The rain came with many people around.	Ruwan sama ya zo tare da mutane da yawa a kusa.
And, we are all human.	Kuma, mu duka mutane ne.
They are all the same.	Magana daya suke duka.
Do you play?	Kuna wasa?
If not.	Idan kuma ba ita ba .
Provisional.	Na ɗan lokaci.
So please give me an answer about this.	Don haka don Allah a ba ni amsa game da wannan.
No one lives here.	Babu wanda ya zauna a nan.
This dish is very hot.	Wannan abincin yana da zafi sosai.
The story is not good.	Labarin ba shi da kyau.
People will kill each other.	Mutane za su kashe juna.
Still, it doesn’t work for them.	Har yanzu, ba ya aiki a gare su.
I wondered how they would be.	Na yi mamakin yadda za su kasance.
Right ahead.	Dama gaba.
I'm just waiting.	Ina jira kawai.
But it was done.	Amma an yi.
He will continue to do so until he is arrested.	Zai ci gaba da yin haka har sai an kama shi.
He turned on her.	Ya kunna mata.
The place is great for swimming.	Wurin yana da kyau don yin iyo.
Let me be.	Bari in zama.
I love her though.	Ina son ta ko da yake.
That happened again.	Hakan ya sake faruwa.
I think maybe he needs help.	Ina tsammanin watakila yana bukatar ya sami taimako.
I get really good at this, but I still hate it.	Ina samun kyau sosai a wannan, amma har yanzu ƙi shi.
He wanted to be.	Ya so ya zama.
I don't want to talk to him either.	Ni ma ban son magana da shi.
We are still waiting.	Har yanzu muna jira.
She had this amazing thing on board.	Tana da wannan abin ban mamaki a cikin jirgin.
We give everyone a chance to speak.	Muna ba kowa damar yin magana.
We will make good things come out of this.	Za mu sa abubuwa masu kyau su zo daga wannan.
Although it is a problem.	Ko da yake yana da matsala.
I don't think people are worried after that.	Bana jin mutane sun damu bayan haka.
No one will be killed.	Ba wanda za a kashe.
But one wants to do it.	Amma daya so ya yi.
You can put anything in it.	Kuna iya sanya komai a ciki.
He did it for him.	Ya yi masa.
I will have my coffee.	Zan sha kofi na.
Seeing is knowing, knowing is seeing.	Gani sani ne, sani kuma gani ne.
We know where you are.	Mun san inda kuke.
Or he is lying.	Ko karya yake yi.
One can only hope so.	Mutum zai iya fatan haka kawai.
Anyone want to tell me what's going on?	Akwai wanda zai so ya gaya mani abin da ke faruwa?
We will send it again by ourselves.	Za mu sake aika shi da kan mu.
She was killed.	An kashe ta.
They will not find you.	Ba za su sami ku ba.
Without.	Babu.
I know him very well.	Na san shi sosai.
He asked her to help.	Ya nemi ta taimaka.
Do what works.	Yi abin da ke aiki.
I went to school in the morning.	Na tafi makaranta da safe.
I paid you.	Na biya ku.
It seems so far gone.	Da alama ya wuce sosai.
But this is from me.	Amma wannan daga gare ni ne.
Attention is high.	Hankali ya kara tashi.
We thought maybe she was sick.	Mun yi tunanin watakila ba ta da lafiya.
She does not even recognize the man.	Ba ta ma gane mutumin ba.
I gave him water.	Na ba shi ruwa.
Not a big deal or anything.	Ba babban yi ko wani abu ba.
More than ever before.	Fiye da tunani a baya.
First off the plane.	Farko tashi daga jirgin .
This will not work.	Wannan ba zai yi aiki ba.
Let's go.	Mu koma.
She knows them.	Ta san su.
In a funny way, it's pretty easy.	A cikin ban dariya hanya, yana da sauƙi sauƙi.
The coffee is cold.	Kofi ya yi sanyi.
When you see them drinking, they are drinking.	Da ka ga suna sha suna sha.
And then again.	Daga nan kuma.
Long life to him!	Tsawon rai a gare shi!
No one, however, gets out.	Babu wanda, duk da haka, samun fita.
It must be done.	Dole ne a yi.
He needs to get some people right away.	Yana buƙatar samun wasu mutane nan take.
They are funny.	Suna da ban dariya.
Sometimes it went well.	Wani lokaci ya tafi lafiya.
It just has to look good.	Dole ne kawai ya yi kyau.
That for the moment must be.	Wannan don lokacin dole ne ya kasance.
School uniforms should be worn regularly.	Yakamata a sanya kayan makaranta kullum.
This is because there is no one.	Wannan saboda babu ɗaya.
I never put myself in it.	Ban taba sanya kaina a ciki ba.
Leave the rest of the world.	Ka bar sauran duniya.
They grow for a long time.	Suna girma na tsawon lokaci.
It will go out.	Zai fita.
They are on a journey.	Suna cikin tafiya.
He can do anything.	Zai iya yin komai.
I think you will be interested.	Ina tsammanin za ku yi sha'awar.
I feel so good about myself right now.	Ina jin dadi sosai game da kaina a yanzu.
He was a child too.	Ya kasance yaro kuma.
I do not remember them.	Ba na tuna su.
No one will enter or leave.	Babu wanda zai shiga ko fita.
Some feel that this is not fair.	Wasu sun ji cewa hakan bai dace ba.
It goes like this.	Yana tafiya kamar haka.
You drank a lot last night.	Kun sha da yawa a daren jiya.
But we do not have the best way to test this.	Amma ba mu da hanya mafi kyau don gwada wannan.
Like the house he himself drinks.	Kamar gidan da kansa yake sha.
What is your story?	Menene labarin ku?.
I'm sure we made it the night before you left.	Na tabbata mun sanya shi dare kafin ku tafi.
I know you very well.	Na san ku sosai.
You went to your place.	Kun tafi wurin ku.
But of course not.	Amma tabbas ba lallai bane.
I love them	Ina son su
It is better not to think about the past.	Yana da kyau ka da a yi tunani a kan abin da ya gabata.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
Or they will take you.	Ko kuma za su kai ku.
Stay at home and stay safe.	Ku zauna a gida ku zauna lafiya.
All the way back.	Duk hanyar a baya.
For a while, though.	Na ɗan lokaci, duk da haka.
But it was not.	Amma bai kasance ba.
I'll show you what we do here.	Zan nuna muku abin da muke yi a nan.
It's bigger too.	Yana da girma kuma.
Do not trust anyone.	Kar ka yarda da kowa.
But this is all for today.	Amma wannan duka na yau ne.
I quickly killed them.	Da sauri na kashe su.
He is coming again.	Ya sake zuwa.
Look at this man.	Kalli wannan mutumin.
And he has no material to do.	Kuma ba shi da kayan da zai yi.
I am not just one of you.	Ni ba daga gare ku ba ne kawai.
It is indeed a good thing.	Lallai abu ne mai kyau.
He left the door open.	Ya bar k'ofar ya bud'e k'ofar.
He did not ask what would make life easier and easier.	Bai tambayi abin da zai sa rayuwa ta sami dadi da sauƙi ba.
They were so scary.	Sun kasance mai ban tsoro sosai.
I may not understand, however, how to do this.	Ba zan iya gane ba, duk da haka, yadda zan yi wannan.
It’s interesting that it’s on another day too.	Yana da ban sha'awa cewa yana kan wata rana kuma.
Life is more difficult.	Rayuwa ta fi wuya.
Things you should have known, and now you know very well.	Abubuwan da ya kamata ku sani, kuma yanzu ku sani sosai.
We want to know what you think.	Muna so mu san me kuke tunani.
I can't answer.	Ba zan iya ba da amsa ba.
I think it's early.	Ina tsammanin yana da wuri.
Make sure all equipment is used properly.	Tabbatar cewa an yi amfani da duk kayan aiki yadda ya kamata.
I have to go in there.	Dole ne in shiga wurin.
You are not alone.	Ba kai kaɗai ba ne.
Okay, 'if' go.	Lafiya, 'idan' tafi.
Not everyone does.	Ba kowa ne ke yi ba.
What a wonderful surprise.	Abin mamaki mai ban mamaki.
Sorry	Yi hakuri
This is as good as it gets.	Wannan yana da kyau kamar yadda ake samu.
And now he has it.	Kuma yanzu yana da shi.
They know you and they know how and why.	Sun san ku kuma sun san yadda kuma me yasa.
Wait, wait, wait.	Jira, jira, jira.
The route is not recommended for travel.	Ba a ba da shawarar hanyar don tafiya ba.
He will do nothing.	Ba zai yi komai ba.
There are other things.	Akwai sauran abubuwa.
We are still working on it.	Har yanzu muna aiki a kai.
You can buy him a drink.	Kuna iya saya masa abin sha.
She assures us that she is safe.	Ta tabbatar mana cewa tana nan lafiya.
For this, he needs you.	Don wannan, yana buƙatar ku.
There is not much to go forward.	Babu da yawa da za a ci gaba.
He wanted to know what she was thinking.	Ya so ya san me take tunani.
We sat down and began to tell the story.	Muka zauna muka fara ba da labarin.
There are so many.	Akwai da yawa.
This is the only one that fits.	Wannan shi ne kawai wanda ya dace.
Now is just the time.	Yanzu lokaci ne kawai.
It's more.	Ya fi yawa.
Not too scary, just a little scary.	Ba tsoro sosai, kawai dan tsoro.
Access is not the same as right.	Samun dama ba daidai yake da daidai ba.
Or something more.	Ko wani abu fiye.
I think he lives here.	Ina tsammanin a nan ne yake zaune.
Have you got a job yet?	Kun sami aiki tukuna?
Let's try something a little harder.	Bari mu gwada wani abu mai ɗan wahala.
It will be the same.	Haka zai kasance.
You can see here, here, here.	Kuna iya gani nan, nan, da nan.
She remained healthy for a year.	Ta kasance lafiya har tsawon shekara guda.
Fine right now.	Lafiya a yanzu.
We were very close.	Mun kasance kusa sosai.
And it seems they will.	Kuma da alama za su yi.
Not me.	Ba ni ba.
There is also one for you.	Akwai kuma daya gare ku.
It looks like only one.	Kama daya ne kawai.
Nothing answered her.	Ba komai ya amsa mata.
Watch this game.	Kalli wannan wasan.
I didn’t really think until the next night.	Bata yi tunani sosai ba sai daren gobe.
I did not expect anyone to do.	Ban yi tsammanin kowa zai yi ba.
Wait, me? 	Jira, me?
But he went further.	Amma ya kara gaba.
We used to live in this house.	Mun taba zama a wannan gidan.
It must have been somewhere nearby.	Dole ne ya kasance a kusa da nan wani wuri.
She will do it today, in fact.	Za ta yi yau, a gaskiya.
He reluctantly agreed.	Cikin rashin so ya yarda.
It is your job.	Aikin ku ne.
They will never.	Ba za su taba ba.
You are smart.	Kuna da hankali.
I would help you.	Da zan taimake ku.
It is one of my favorite things to do.	Yana ɗaya daga cikin abubuwan da na fi so.
I have not learned anything about them.	Ban koyi wani abu game da su ba.
Very happy.	Farin ciki sosai.
Eleven and thirty.	Sha daya da talatin.
Things are going well now.	Abubuwa sun yi kyau a yanzu.
That would upset me.	Hakan zai bata min rai.
Now you have two things.	Yanzu kuna da abubuwa biyu.
This is ridiculous.	Wannan abin dariya ne.
It covers the actual game viewer very well.	Yana rufe ainihin abin duba wasa sosai.
It's so nice to be there.	Yana da kyau sosai don zama.
I hope there is more to it.	Ina fata akwai ƙarin abin da ke can.
Do you think it is difficult to buy?	Kuna tsammanin yana da wuya a saya?
This will be a development.	Wannan zai zama ci gaba.
Now, you can have a seat.	Yanzu, kuna iya samun wurin zama.
Not a little.	Ba kadan ba.
Certainly not.	Babu shakka ba za a taɓa yin hakan ba.
Type things out.	Ka buga abubuwa.
She sent for him.	Ta aika a kira shi.
I feel something hot.	Ina jin wani abu mai zafi.
I would have come here to protect you.	Da na zo nan don in kare ku.
I forgot who he was.	Na manta wanene shi.
She really helped me.	Ta taimake ni sosai .
So that would be ridiculous.	Don haka da zai kasance abin dariya.
We get to do whatever we want, so can anyone.	Muna samun yin duk abin da muke so, haka ma kowa zai iya.
This did not happen.	Wannan bai yi ba.
Not sure.	Ba ku tabbata ba.
They have been doing this for years.	Sun yi shekaru suna yin haka.
He grew up that way.	Ya girma haka.
It certainly looks great, though.	Tabbas ya yi kama da gaske, ko da yake.
I got a job	Na sami aiki
Yet he knew he had to go.	Amma duk da haka ya san cewa dole ne ya tafi.
This will be shown later.	Za a nuna wannan daga baya.
Get behind life before it gets behind you.	Samun bayan rayuwa kafin ta sami bayan ku.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
No, she did not.	A'a, ba ta yi ba.
He would not accept anything.	Ba zai yarda da wani abu ba.
If they can help us, they can help us.	Idan za su taimake mu, za su iya taimaka mana.
They made us.	Sun sanya mu.
I tried it now.	Na gwada yanzu.
If you do that it is amazing.	Idan kun yi hakan yana da ban mamaki.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Just look and get it.	Ku duba kawai ku samu.
He has to stop this now, or he will never.	Dole ne ya daina wannan a yanzu, ko ba zai taba ba.
They love me.	Suna son ni.
You are so amazing.	Kuna da ban mamaki sosai.
We do not need help.	Ba ma bukatar taimako.
Children need to eat well.	Yara suna buƙatar cin abinci mai kyau.
So you need to add these too.	Don haka kuna buƙatar ƙara waɗannan ma.
Everything should stay where it is.	Duk abin da ya kamata ya tsaya a inda yake.
They said that could not happen.	Suka ce hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba.
He knew he was going to be arrested.	Ya san za a kama shi.
Go somewhere you will never be found.	Ku tafi wani wuri ba za a taɓa samun ku ba.
Some will never be.	Wasu ba za su taba zama ba.
For a while he seemed to lose what he was thinking.	Na dan wani lokaci kamar ya rasa me yake tunani.
I do not know what is in it.	Ban san me ke ciki ba.
I don't know how he does it.	Ban san yadda yake yi ba.
Maybe someone made a mistake.	Wataƙila wani ya yi muku kuskure.
I wonder if it is true.	Ina mamaki ko gaskiya ne.
It is a beautiful journey from one world to another.	Yana da kyau tafiya daga wannan duniya zuwa wata.
This, however, is nothing to us.	Wannan, duk da haka, a gare mu ba shi da wani abu.
It happened.	Haka ya faru.
I tried to let it pass.	Na yi ƙoƙari na bar shi ya wuce.
I want to say.	Ina so in ce.
Like she wouldn’t allow herself to be.	Kamar ba za ta yarda ta kasance ba.
I'll check it out.	Zan duba shi.
He came out with us once.	Ya fito tare da mu sau ɗaya.
Immediately a man opened the door.	Nan take wani mutum ya bude kofar.
You did a lot this weekend.	Kun yi abubuwa da yawa a wannan karshen mako.
Start working now.	Fara aiki yanzu.
Make room for yourself.	Yi wa kanku wuri.
I can see everything.	Ina iya ganin komai.
I know every job.	Na san kowane aiki.
She cried when she went alone.	Kuka ta yi lokacin da ta tafi ita kaɗai.
Now it explains how to use it.	Yanzu ya bayyana yadda ake amfani da shi.
But we are not one.	Amma mu ba daya muke ba.
I waited for her to close the door.	Na jira ta rufe kofar.
I did too.	Ni ma na yi.
People started talking, you know.	Mutane sun fara magana, ka sani.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
They are here for you.	Suna nan don ku.
There is no such person.	Babu wani irin mutumin nan.
Sometimes these are shown.	Wani lokaci ana nuna waɗannan.
So far, nothing new.	Ya zuwa yanzu, babu wani sabon abu.
It's nothing.	Bata ce komai ba.
Now no one lives there.	Yanzu babu wanda ya zauna a wurin.
He told me to come inside with him.	Ya ce in zo ciki tare da shi.
He passed it.	Ya wuce shi.
I try to think of myself as a smoker.	Ina ƙoƙarin tunanin kaina ina shan taba.
So now, in the end, something could happen.	Don haka yanzu, a ƙarshe, wani abu na iya faruwa.
Komai.	Komai.
I don't know how to do it.	Ban san yadda za ku yi ba.
But this is not the right way because.	Amma wannan ba shine hanyar da ta dace ba saboda.
They fight, they care, they protect.	Suna fada, suna kula, suna kare.
I will do you good.	Zan yi muku kyau.
He can leave.	Zai iya barin.
I'm here when you want to talk.	Ina nan lokacin da kuke son yin magana.
She just sat there and looked at everyone.	Zaune take kawai ta kalli kowa.
It's not, 'he said, seriously.	Ba haka ba,' in ji shi, da gaske.
Every year it just gets better.	Kowace shekara kawai yana samun kyau.
Maybe he will get the job.	Wataƙila zai sami aikin.
I told you you would learn something.	Na gaya muku za ku koyi wani abu.
She recognized this immediately.	Wannan ta gane nan take.
This is getting interesting.	Wannan yana samun ban sha'awa.
They are still outside.	Har yanzu suna waje.
So, that helps.	Don haka, hakan yana da taimako.
She never did that.	Ba ta taba yin haka ba.
It's still good.	Har yanzu yana da kyau.
I think everyone knows that.	Ina jin kowa ya san haka.
I know it exists.	Na san akwai shi.
No one said much.	Babu wanda yace da yawa.
They will not do anything to me.	Ba za su yi min komai ba.
Just be here, right now.	Kawai kasance a nan, a yanzu.
I don’t know why this worked.	Ban san dalilin da yasa wannan yayi aiki ba.
You wonder what could have caused someone to do that.	Kuna mamakin abin da zai iya sa wani ya yi haka.
He got up quickly.	Ya tashi da sauri.
I did not want to, we said.	Ban so, muka ce.
Don't let him bother you.	Kada ka bari ya damu ka.
I saw he got it.	Na ga ya samu.
I decided to quit smoking.	Na yanke shawarar daina shan taba.
Leave it a little.	Bar shi kadan.
The more you do it, the easier it is.	Yawan yin shi, yana da sauƙi.
He said more than he wanted to.	Ya ce fiye da yadda yake so.
They did not reach.	Ba su kai ba.
He was honest.	Ya kasance mai gaskiya.
That made me laugh.	Hakan ya bani dariya.
The truth will come out.	Gaskiya za ta fita.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
Now they can.	Yanzu za su iya.
And of course not.	Kuma tabbas ba haka bane.
No known identities have been identified.	Ba a gano wani da aka sani ba.
Now always.	Yanzu kullum.
I feel it very well.	Ina jin shi sosai.
I don't have that kind of time.	Ba ni da irin wannan lokacin.
Walk fast or you are too late to work again.	Yi tafiya da sauri ko kun makara don aiki kuma.
Everywhere we go, people are watching us.	Duk inda muka je, mutane suna kallon mu.
So, things can go wrong.	Saboda haka, abubuwa na iya yin kuskure.
The problem bothered him.	Matsala ta bata masa rai.
Nice to have you here with me !.	Na yi farin cikin samun ku a nan tare da ni!.
Nothing has really changed.	Babu wani abu da ya canza da gaske.
Maybe this will help.	Wataƙila wannan zai taimaka.
You can't take care of it.	Ba za ku iya kula da shi ba.
Nothing has fascinated me before.	Babu wani abu da ya bani sha'awa kafin wannan.
You asked me to talk to them.	Kun ce in yi magana da su.
This is not a new conclusion.	Wannan ba sabon ƙarshe ba ne.
They drank coffee in their usual place.	Suka sha kofi a inda suka saba.
It could be here.	Tana iya zama a nan.
But he also failed.	Amma shi ma bai yi nasara ba.
You go about your day as usual.	Kuna tafiya ranar ku kamar yadda kuka saba.
Everyone knows, including children.	Kowa ya sani, har da yara.
We are happy with it.	Mun yi farin ciki da shi.
He begins to cry.	Ya fara kuka.
Our players do.	Yan wasan mu suna yi.
If he is injured they will not do it.	Idan ya ji rauni ba za su yi ba.
The first was simple.	Na farko ya kasance mai sauƙi.
It is very sunny outside.	Akwai rana sosai a waje.
Unemployment is high here.	Rashin aikin yi ya yi yawa a nan.
No, that would not work.	A'a, hakan ma ba zai yi aiki ba.
Another time they immediately rejected him.	Wani lokaci kuma nan da nan suka ƙi shi.
It was exciting to have that to work at the time.	Ya kasance mai ban sha'awa don samun hakan don yin aiki a lokacin.
She agreed to come and play.	Ta yarda ta zo ta yi wasa.
Something is wrong.	Wani abu ba daidai ba.
No time to think about it, you know.	Babu lokacin tunani game da shi, ka sani.
You will not do anything again.	Ba za ku koma yin komai ba.
I tried this method.	Na gwada wannan hanyar.
There are things to do.	Akwai abubuwan da ya kamata a yi.
If that does not happen soon enough, nothing will happen.	Idan hakan bai dawo da shi da sauri ba, babu abin da zai faru.
He puts it gently.	Ya sa shi a hankali.
We will sell it to you immediately.	Za mu sayar muku da shi nan take.
But not in a good way.	Amma ba ta hanya mai kyau ba.
The car is behind the wrong house.	Motar tana bayan gidan da bai dace ba.
It is later.	Daga baya ne.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba abin mamaki ba ne.
We hope to have that this year.	Muna fatan samun hakan a wannan shekara.
Of course we want to help '.	Tabbas muna so mu taimaka'.
Or because nothing is happening.	Ko don babu abin da ke faruwa.
But he knew he had found the feeling.	Amma ya san ya gano ji.
It makes me happy.	Yana sa ni jin daɗi.
However, there is no universal answer.	Duk da haka, babu wata amsa ta duniya.
I am not like anyone else.	Ba ni kamar kowa ba.
But only one.	Amma daya kawai.
I have never seen this.	Ban taba ganin wannan ba.
It is also done.	Ana kuma yin haka.
I can see why people would be interested.	Ina iya ganin dalilin da yasa mutane za su sha'awar.
Feel they are dead.	Ji sun mutu.
The road is moving forward.	Lallai hanyar ta ci gaba.
But I feel out.	Amma ji na fita.
But now he is gone.	Amma yanzu ya tafi.
How much is life in it.	Nawa ne rayuwa a ciki.
I have to bring it back.	Dole ne in dawo da ita.
It can read people.	Yana iya karanta mutane.
Nothing ever worked.	Babu wani abu da ya taɓa yin aiki.
You have it.	Kuna da ita.
It makes him laugh.	Ya sa shi dariya.
They still do.	Har yanzu suna yi.
Maybe we can do something.	Wataƙila za mu iya yin wani abu.
We have never touched a ship.	Ba mu taɓa taɓa jirgin ruwa ba.
And of course there are more to come.	Kuma tabbas akwai sauran masu zuwa.
Here you are.	Ga mu nan.
Just make your work as usual.	Kawai sanya aikin ku kamar yadda aka saba.
You know, just do it.	Ka sani, yi kawai.
That is a fact.	Gaskiya kenan.
The view is beautiful too.	Kallon yana da kyau kuma.
I wonder why you didn’t.	Ina mamakin me yasa ba ku yi ba.
I had to add two more years to school.	Dole ne in kara shekaru biyu na makaranta.
They seem to have done so much.	Da alama sun yi da yawa haka.
The bus is full.	Motar bas ta cika.
I was trying to get them to do that.	Na kasance ina ƙoƙarin sa su yi haka.
No one knows anything.	Babu wanda ya san komai.
But it will not start.	Amma ba zai fara ba.
I don't want to do that.	Ba na son yin wannan.
No one wants to go against each other.	Ba wanda yake so ya yi gaba da juna.
They caught up in the moment.	Sun kama cikin lokacin.
Absolutely it is.	Babu shakka shi ne.
No, it did not.	A'a, hakan bai cika kama shi ba.
No mistake now.	Babu kuskure a yanzu.
We didn’t think so, how.	Ba mu yi tunanin haka ba, ta yaya.
Nothing really changed me.	Babu wani abu da ya canza mini da gaske.
I will not let him go.	Ba zan bar shi ya tafi ba.
Thoughts keep coming from somewhere.	Tunani na ci gaba da zuwa daga wani wuri.
He is the one we are in the end.	Shi ne wanda mu a ƙarshe.
Gradually it happened.	A hankali ya faru.
I will not take that upon you.	Ba zan dauki hakan a kanku ba.
But no more.	Amma babu sauran.
But it will not be removed.	Amma ba za a cire shi ba.
What is it.	Menene ni.
No one said anything, but everyone there wanted to kill him.	Ba wanda ya ce komai, amma duk wanda ke wurin ya so ya kashe shi.
The world must be a better place to live.	Dole ne duniya ta zama wuri mafi kyau don zama.
Nothing was as it was.	Ba abin da ya kasance kamar yadda ya kasance.
I could not live without it.	Ba zan iya rayuwa ba tare da shi ba.
He has one hand.	Yana da hannu daya.
I refuse to sell anything.	Na ƙi sayar da komai.
They will be brought back.	Za a dawo da su.
But it does not have to be this way.	Amma bai kamata ya kasance haka ba.
This is just money for play.	Wannan kudi ne kawai na wasa.
I didn’t think of that by the way.	Ban yi tunanin wannan ta hanyar ba.
There is no money to do the things we do.	Babu kudi don yin abubuwan da muka yi.
With that said, it is a good film.	Da wannan ya ce, fim ne mai kyau.
Of course there is water on the ground.	Tabbas akwai ruwa a kasa.
I will go home.	Zan koma gida.
Hope you never use it.	Kuna fatan ba za ku taɓa amfani da shi ba.
And to make the end is to make the first.	Kuma yin ƙarshe shine yin farko.
I finally got there.	Na isa can a ƙarshe.
In the past, they were easy to identify.	A baya, yana da sauƙi a gano su.
And maybe no one ever told him.	Kuma watakila babu wanda ya taɓa gaya masa.
There is nothing to do but take them.	Babu abin yi sai kai su.
You look healthy.	Ga alama kana da lafiya.
While this may be true, it may not be for the best.	Duk da yake hakan na iya zama gaskiya, yana iya zama ba don mafi kyau ba.
If you see it please remove it.	Idan kun gani don Allah a cire shi.
We can not do it here.	Ba za mu iya yi a nan ba.
I just told myself that.	Na gaya wa kaina haka kawai.
You do not understand why someone would stay true.	Ba ka fahimci dalilin da ya sa wani zai zauna gaskiya ne.
Either way, you are going to give someone a really good job.	Ko ta yaya, za ku ba wa wani aiki mai kyau sosai.
I can't do anything about it.	Ba zan iya yin komai game da ita ba.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
The better, the better.	Ya fi kyau, ya fi kyau.
You did well.	Ka yi kyau.
I'm tired of that.	Na gaji da hakan.
They don’t like me for anything.	Ba sa so ni don komai.
Maybe he is not here.	Wataƙila ba ya nan.
It is all that is needed.	Shi ne duk abin da ake bukata.
Then a man passed by.	Sai wani mutum ya wuce.
He got out of the car.	Ya fito daga motar.
As it should be.	Yadda ya kamata ya kasance.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
The house was very hot, but it was nice.	Gidan ya yi zafi sosai, amma ya ji daɗi.
Everyone must be carrying something in it.	Dole ne kowa ya kasance yana ɗaukar abu a ciki.
But kill them.	Amma ku kashe su.
The game is growing and needs to keep growing.	Wasan ya girma kuma yana buƙatar ci gaba da girma.
It can remind you.	Zai iya tuna ku.
Everyone will know that joining.	Kowa zai san cewa shiga.
He passed it.	Ya wuce shi.
As usual.	Kamar yadda aka saba.
He will go with you.	Zai tafi tare da ku.
This is a sign.	Wannan alama ce.
It's easy.	Yana da sauƙi.
But for the time being, that is what it is.	Amma ga lokacin, shi ne abin da yake.
Simple and works great.	Mai sauƙi kuma yana aiki mai girma.
They all failed to bring relief.	Duk sun kasa kawo dauki.
But he did not care.	Amma bai kula ba.
I don't want anything.	Ba na son komai.
But only for a while.	Amma kawai na ɗan lokaci.
She loves to laugh and is fit and enjoys.	Tana son yin dariya kuma ta dace kuma tana jin daɗi.
They don't feel that way anymore.	Ba sa jin haka kuma.
Just looking for a problem.	Neman matsala ne kawai.
The workload is growing.	Aikin yana kara girma.
You are walking.	Kuna tafiya.
And no one is needed.	Kuma babu wanda ake bukata.
He often gets them.	Yana yawan samun su.
Gradually, without a hitch, nothing happened.	A hankali, ba tare da ban mamaki ba, babu abin da ya faru.
You know, why she never took her head off.	Ka sani, dalilin da ya sa ba ta taba cire mata kai ba.
I will be happy if you will, she said.	Zan yi farin ciki idan kuna so, in ji ta.
Watching it will make me run.	Kallon shi zai sa na gudu.
That will do.	Wannan zai yi.
This is the place.	Wannan ya zama wurin.
But do not eat too much!	Amma kada ku ci da yawa!
I even agree with him.	Har na yarda da shi.
I do not know why though at first.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa ko da yake da farko.
He is not very well.	Ba shi da lafiya sosai.
They are missing.	Sun rasa.
And she agreed.	Kuma ta yarda.
He died there.	Ya mutu a can.
But we can.	Amma za mu iya.
I hated this job.	Na ƙi wannan aikin.
I will try this first.	Zan gwada hakan da farko.
The idea worked well in the cold.	Tunanin ya yi aiki da kyau a cikin sanyi.
Probably not a big deal.	Wataƙila ba abu ne mai girma ba.
But they are interesting.	Amma suna da ban sha'awa.
I am not alone.	Ba ni kadai ba.
But just by name.	Amma kawai da suna.
There is only one way.	Akwai hanya guda ɗaya kawai.
But you have to get involved.	Amma dole ne ku shiga ciki.
Maybe this will be a big trip.	Wataƙila wannan zai zama babban tafiya.

Once or twice he was already accustomed to it.	Sau daya ko sau biyu ya riga ya saba masa.

It works like the one you used before.	Yana aiki kamar wanda kuka yi amfani da shi a baya.
And that was about it.	Kuma wannan ya kasance game da shi.

Of course I need a drink.	Tabbas ina buƙatar wani abin sha.
In the end, everyone worked very hard together.	A ƙarshe, kowa yayi aiki tare sosai.
To this day, they do not know.	Har yau, ba su sani ba.
It makes her afraid to sleep.	Ya sa ta ji tsoron barci.

There is no doubt about it.	Babu shakka game da shi.

Injuries in the neck.	Rauni a wuya.

She does not know what they are.	Ba ta san me suke ba.
He prepared the food.	Ya shirya abincin.
I hope she changes.	Ina fatan ta canza.
He was arrested.	An kama shi.
Everything is amazing and not surprising to me.	Duk abin mamaki ne ba abin mamaki ba a gare ni.

That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.

Time has passed slowly.	Lokaci ya wuce a hankali.
However, women are doing an invisible, thought-provoking job.	Duk da haka, mata suna yin aikin da ba a iya gani ba, aikin tunani.
But other things too.	Amma sauran abubuwa kuma.
And she will.	Kuma za ta.
Outside.	A waje.

And forget everything you know.	Kuma ka manta da duk abin da ka sani.
As she was, she had more than she could do.	Kamar yadda ta kasance, tana da fiye da abin da za ta iya yi.
I had to sit and think about this.	Dole na zauna na yi tunanin wannan.
This can be done in a person's home.	Ana iya yin hakan a cikin gidan mutum.
Please take a moment to read our contents.	Da fatan za a ɗauki ɗan lokaci don karanta abubuwan da ke cikin mu.
I know you must love me now.	Na san dole ka so ni yanzu.

So, and for the person.	Don haka, kuma ga mutum.
There is no mistake.	Babu wurin kuskure.
I decided that we needed to go back.	Na yanke shawarar cewa muna bukatar mu koma baya.
Of course you can have a night.	Tabbas kuna iya samun dare.
And I have no way to go to work to earn money.	Kuma ba ni da hanyar zuwa aiki don samun kuɗi.
He found the job difficult.	Ya sami aikin yi da wuya.
There are so many things.	Abubuwa ne da yawa.
Okay, hard.	Ya yi, wuya.
They saw a great time.	Sun ga babban lokaci.
Although I was not happy about that.	Ko da yake ban yi farin ciki da wannan ba.

But it is not.	Amma ba shi ba.
You have time.	Kuna da lokaci.

I hope you will stop this game now.	Ina fata za ku daina wannan wasan yanzu.

She lives alone.	Ita kadai take rayuwa.
She is sad.	Ta yi bakin ciki.
People agree with him.	Mutane sun yarda da shi.

It does not have to and should not be.	Ba dole ba ne kuma bai kamata in kasance haka ba.

He would kill her if he could.	Zai kashe ta idan zai iya.
They live the truth and live only for the truth.	Suna rayuwa gaskiya kuma suna rayuwa ne don gaskiya kawai.
Toys are backwards.	Kayan wasan yara sun koma baya.

Of course it looks like it.	Tabbas ya yi kama da shi.
When it will end.	Lokacin da zai gama.
Have you ever been to a restaurant?	Shin kun taɓa zuwa gidan abinci?
We are not alone.	Ba mu kawai ba.
I think she needs to do that a little bit.	Ina ganin tana bukatar yin hakan kadan kadan.
I do not understand that.	Ban gane haka ba.
Remove it and come back in time.	Cire shi kuma ku dawo cikin lokacin.
So it is very close yet many years.	Don haka yana kusa sosai amma duk da haka shekaru masu yawa.
I am a school teacher.	Ni malamin makaranta ne.
Of course, he was right.	Tabbas, ya kasance daidai.
If anyone knows please help me with that.	Idan wani ya sani don Allah a taimake ni akan hakan.
Are you working? 	Kana aiki?
We will not let them go with anything.	Ba za mu bar su su tafi da komai ba.

Everything is going wrong.	Komai yana tafiya ba daidai ba.
All of this was very interesting.	Duk wannan ya kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
He wished she was, but he knew she wasn't.	Ya yi fatan ta kasance, amma ya san ba ita ba.
This is a wonderful book.	Wannan littafin karatu ne mai ban mamaki.
They did not even hear.	Ba su ma ji ba.
She knew the truth, but she said nothing.	Ta san gaskiya, amma ba ta ce komai ba.
Read with us.	Yi karatu tare da mu.
He pretended not to hear anything.	Ya yi kamar bai ji komai ba.
I hated it all.	Na ƙi shi duka.
And she lives.	Kuma tana rayuwa.
I was alone all the time.	Ni kadai ne duk tsawon lokacin.
I check it every day on it.	Ina duba shi kowace rana a kai.
She sees.	Ta gani.
If he can touch them, it will be easier.	Idan zai iya taba su, zai zama mafi sauƙi.
You recognize it.	Kuna gane shi.
Do not get up and sit down.	Kar ku tashi zaune.
They bought the house for a song.	Sun sayi gidan don waƙa.
And that makes me sick.	Kuma hakan yana sa ni rashin lafiya.
It makes me work.	Ya sa ni aiki.
You just want to be yourself.	Kuna so kawai ku zama kanku.
The food is good.	Abincin yana da kyau.
You have a problem.	Kuna da matsala.
Wait a minute.	Jira kadan.
You will never walk alone.	Ba za ku taɓa tafiya kai kaɗai ba.
I think you are playing with me.	Ina tsammanin kuna wasa da ni.
I'm glad you got this benefit.	Na yi farin ciki da kuka sami wannan amfani.
Please give me some time.	Don Allah a ba ni ɗan lokaci.
It is not difficult to kill a person.	Ba abu ne mai wuya a kashe mutum ba.
I have to be good about that kind of thing.	Dole ne in yi kyau game da irin wannan abu.
Walk on this path.	Tafiya a kan wannan hanya.
He wrote the story of everything that happened.	Ya rubuta labarin duk abin da ya faru.
Just walk.	Tafiya kawai.
He is ready.	Ya shirya.
Save it.	Ajiye shi.
A book of thought and practical work.	Littafin tunani da aiki mai amfani.
One has to speak.	Dole ne mutum yayi magana.
Indeed, they are the only ones.	Lallai su kadai ne.
The world is safe.	Duniya tana lafiya.
I know her inside.	Na san ta a ciki.
I refuse to use any other name.	Na ƙi yin amfani da wani suna.
He will not buy.	Ba zai saya ba.
It is not good, but it is not good.	Ba shi da kyau, amma ba shi da kyau.
She decided not to let it show.	Ta yanke shawarar kada ta bari ya nuna.
Who is there? 	Wanene a can?
Such a thing has never happened to me before.	Irin wannan abu bai faru da ni ba a da.
Any work.	Duk wani aiki.
I have something to say to you.	Ina da abin da zan ce maka.
But it is not always appropriate.	Amma ba koyaushe ya dace ba.
But it is true.	Amma gaskiya ce.
It is there but not.	Yana can amma babu.
They make you join anytime.	Suna sa ku shiga kowane lokaci.
I have no way of proving this, it just feels true.	Ba ni da hanyar tabbatar da wannan, kawai yana jin gaskiya.
To the house.	Zuwa gidan.
Just go and make your movie.	Kawai je ku yi fim ɗin ku.
And we can find it.	Kuma za mu iya gano shi.
No wet clothes.	Babu rigar rigar.
No problem.	Babu wata matsala.
The cut was not disclosed.	Ba a bayyana yanke ba.
Nothing to do.	Babu wani abu da ya yi.
However, it is good to see.	Duk da haka, yana da kyau a gani.
It will be next time.	Za ta gaba lokaci.
Think about the book.	Ka yi tunani game da littafin.
I do not know what the future holds for me.	Ban san abin da gaba zai kawo mini ba.
He had no answer, he said.	Bashi da amsa, yace.
That's what we're going to do.	Abin da za mu yi ke nan.
If so, he did not say anything, but he would not get it.	Idan haka ne, bai ce komai ba, amma kuma ba zai samu ba.
Rain	Ruwan sama
This is a great help.	Wannan babban taimako ne.
Maybe someone left a meal.	Wataƙila wani ya bar abinci.
Maybe he is sleeping.	Wataƙila yana barci.
I finished doing that.	Na gama yin hakan.
We were able to talk.	Mun sami damar magana.
She wanted them to come back together.	Ta so su dawo tare.
This is something you should never do.	Wannan abu ne da bai kamata ku taɓa yi ba.
When they learned what it was, many left.	Lokacin da suka koyi abin da yake, da yawa sun tafi.
But twice is not enough.	Amma sau biyu bai isa ba.
They would have gone home early.	Da sun tafi gida da wuri.
This is what life is all about.	Wannan ita ce abin da rayuwa ta kasance.
I am not in this for money.	Ba na cikin wannan don kuɗi.
And patient.	Kuma mai hakuri.
Things like that are growing.	Abubuwan irin wannan suna girma.
No one will worry.	Babu wanda zai damu.
Go out to dinner at your favorite restaurant.	Fita zuwa abincin dare a gidan abincin da kuka fi so.
They always have something to do!	Koyaushe suna da abin da za ku yi!
Just panic and run.	Kawai jin tsoro da gudu.
She just needs to see.	Ta kawai bukatar gani.
For a while it was nothing.	D'an d'an lokaci bata ce komai ba.
We want to know more about it.	Muna son ƙarin sani game da shi.
And now he leaves her again.	Kuma yanzu ya sake barin ta.
I want to be here right now.	Ina so in kasance a nan da yanzu.
Find the one that doesn't fit.	Gano wanda bai dace ba.
I think of the sun.	Ina tunanin rana.
No one can be you more than you.	Babu wanda zai iya zama ku fiye da ku.
This is what we have been waiting for.	Wannan shi ne abin da muka dade muna jira.
And for the third time.	Kuma a karo na uku.
He even asked me for water.	Har ya tambaye ni ruwa.
Talk to everyone.	Yi magana da kowa.
Will she fly again.	Shin zata sake tashi.
They can not be.	Ba za su iya zama ba.
But no one was there.	Amma babu kowa a wurin.
He is a child.	Yaro ne.
I can still.	Har yanzu zan iya.
They feel the door open and quickly close.	Suna jin bude kofar da sauri ta rufe.
Right, outside and inside.	Dama, waje da ciki.
It was a great success.	Babban nasara ce.
Lack of thought.	Rashin tunani.
Either way this is a compassionate response.	Ta wata hanya wannan amsa ce ta jin kai.
Hope that 'now everything will change'.	Fatan cewa 'yanzu komai zai canza'.
Don't play with this!	Kada ku yi wasa da wannan!
I use them every day and I enjoy it more.	Na yi amfani da su kowace rana kuma na fi jin daɗi.
He loves to read.	Yana son karatu.
I thought maybe you would like to appear.	Na yi tunanin watakila za ku so ku bayyana.
But he was afraid.	Amma ya ji tsoro.
You probably shouldn’t talk about it, actually.	Wataƙila bai kamata ku yi magana game da shi ba, a gaskiya.
I can also add it.	Zan iya kuma ƙara da shi.
Don't be late!	Kar ku makara!
You do not understand.	Ba ku gane ba.
I made no mistake.	Ban yi kuskure ba.
Everything he did was right.	Duk abin da ya yi haka ne.
It’s an awesome job and it can be amazing.	Yana da aiki mai ban tsoro kuma yana iya zama mai ban mamaki.
You can't do that.	Ba za ku iya yin hakan ba.
He put away his tools.	Ya ajiye kayan aikin sa.
But they make it difficult to control things.	Amma sun sa ya yi wuya a kula da abubuwan.
He was against what everyone else was doing.	Ya kasance gaba da abin da kowa ke yi.
We meet every weekend.	Mun hadu kowane karshen mako.
He gave her a week to find him again.	Ya ba ta mako guda ta sake gano shi.
I am alive	Ina da rai
But there is really no right or wrong.	Amma da gaske babu daidai ko kuskure.
Some people use it.	Wasu mutane suna amfani da shi.
This has been very useful.	Wannan ya kasance mai amfani sosai.
It doesn't look very good, but it works.	Ba shi da kyau sosai, amma yana aiki.
And every year, it will never be me.	Kuma kowace shekara, ba zai taba zama ni ba.
It may take some time.	Yana iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci.
Let me tell you something more.	Bari in kara gaya muku wani abu.
You can do the same thing here.	Kuna iya yin abu ɗaya a nan.
I like watching hot.	Ina son kallon zafi.
I don't know how to fix this.	Ban san yadda za a gyara wannan ba.
I wonder what will happen now.	Ina mamakin me zai faru yanzu.
He must have found her.	Tabbas ya gano ta.
That's what he wants us to do.	Abin da yake so mu yi ke nan.
But he is a great man.	Amma shi babban mutum ne.
They heard something.	Sun ji wani abu.
The teacher was very interested in finding her.	Malamin ya yi matukar sha'awar gano ta.
It's over.	An kare.
The story surprised me.	Labarin ya ba ni mamaki.
Of course, it often does not work that way.	Tabbas, sau da yawa ba ya aiki haka.
We don't want to play anymore.	Ba mu son yin wasa kuma.
He opened the front door and entered.	Ya bude kofar gida ya shiga.
Maybe this time it would be right.	Wataƙila wannan lokacin zai zama daidai.
I tell you this.	Ina gaya muku wannan.
It went really well.	Ya tafi da kyau sosai.
You can be me.	Kuna iya zama min.
Wrong.	Ba daidai ba.
She has been looking for a job ever since.	Tun daga nan take neman aiki.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
We have that.	Muna da haka.
So this is what we expect to see when everything goes well.	Don haka wannan shine abin da muke tsammanin gani lokacin da komai yayi kyau.
However, it works otherwise.	Duk da haka, yana aiki in ba haka ba.
Or he may be able to do something.	Ko kuma ya iya yin wani abu.
So it is not clear who should come first.	Don haka ba a bayyana wanda ya kamata ya fara zuwa ba.
Please show me the way.	Allah ka nuna min hanya don Allah.
He asked him to stop.	Ya tambaye shi ya tsaya.
I don’t feel life works that way.	Bana jin rayuwa tana aiki haka.
He did not think it would be so easy.	Bai yi tsammanin za a yi sauƙi haka ba.
Here he comes.	Nan ya fito.
I'm not used to it.	Ban saba ba.
Still sick.	Har yanzu rashin lafiya.
She couldn't believe it was happening again.	Ta kasa yarda hakan yana sake faruwa.
This will take care of it.	Wannan zai kula da shi.
But it's like doing everything.	Amma kamar yin komai ne.
They can be delivered quickly and easily installed.	Ana iya ba da su da sauri kuma a saka su cikin sauƙi.
We have to find something that is comfortable with the car.	Dole ne mu sami wani abu wanda yake da jin daɗin motar.
Things can not go on as they are for a long time.	Abubuwa ba za su iya ci gaba da tafiya yadda suke ba tsawon lokaci.
Or he passed.	Ko ya wuce.
Few of these decisions were acted upon.	Kadan daga cikin wannan shawarar da aka yi aiki da ita.
With running water in the house.	Da ruwa mai gudu a cikin gida.
It was at this point that he was arrested.	A wannan lokacin ne aka kama shi.
No one paid them anything.	Babu wanda ya biya su komai.
I know they are there.	Na san suna can.
They say you are doing well.	Suna cewa kana yin kyau.
They cannot be all winners.	Ba za su iya zama duka masu nasara ba.
The better you, the harder it is to play.	Mafi kyawun ku, da wuya ku yi wasa.
There are two women and one man on the ground.	Mata biyu da mutum daya ne a kasa.
Not surprisingly.	Ba abin mamaki ba ne.
There were some incidents.	Akwai wasu abubuwan da suka faru.
However, he needs it.	Duk da haka, yana buƙatar shi.
You can not see.	Ba za ku iya gani ba.
You will not die.	Ba za ku mutu ba.
Less than today.	Kasa da yau.
I have spent a lot of that time.	Na dade da yawa na wannan lokacin.
From whatever they were.	Daga duk abin da suka kasance.
Either way it is recommended.	Ko haka aka ba da shawarar.
I was here, right there, at the right time.	Ina nan, a daidai wurin, a daidai lokacin.
Two pedestrians collided with each other.	Masu tafiya a kasa guda biyu sun yi karo da juna.
I really need that to happen.	Ina matukar bukatar hakan ta faru.
Don't do it all for yourself.	Kar ka yi wa kaina duka game da shi.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
None found.	Ba a sami ko ɗaya ba.
We thought we missed you.	Mun dauka mun rasa ku.
He has to work with it.	Dole ne ya yi aiki da shi.
This is not the only way.	Wannan ba wata hanya ce kaɗai ba.
It seems certain.	Da alama ya tabbata.
This, of course, is not surprising.	Wannan, ba shakka, ba abin mamaki ba ne.
But maybe not next time.	Amma watakila ba za a yi wani lokaci na gaba ba.
As she does.	Kamar yadda take yi.
Using a boat.	Amfani da jirgin ruwa.
It is good to think before you speak.	Yana da kyau a yi tunani kafin ku yi magana.
He closed the door.	Ya rufe kofar.
They will not take the answer.	Ba za su dauki amsa ba.
He surprised me how she lived at home.	Ya ba ni mamaki ko ta yaya tana zaune a gida.
I can really talk to you.	Zan iya magana da ku da gaske.
Why does it hurt so much?	Me yasa yayi zafi haka?
Everything, everything, is wrong.	Komai, kowane abu, ba daidai ba ne.
Someone is acting like someone else.	Wani yana yin kamar wani ne.
I think that’s why I keep going.	Ina tsammanin abin da ya sa na ci gaba.
He is a man who has won in the past.	Mutum ne da ya ci nasara a baya.
We confirm the last statement.	Mun tabbatar da magana ta ƙarshe.
What did you do at work today?	Me kuka yi yau a wurin aikin ku?.
Not difficult, just do.	Ba wuya, kawai yi.
Now, that is the age.	Yanzu, wannan shine shekaru.
He tried to be very careful, and nothing happened.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya yi hankali sosai, kuma babu abin da ya faru.
But there is a lot on me.	Amma akwai da yawa a kaina.
She could not remember anything that had happened.	Ba ta iya tuna wani abu da ya faru.
Basically, we all had the opportunity to travel together twice.	Ainihin, duk mun sami damar tafiya tare sau biyu.
It is always late.	Kullum yana makara.
I will go and prepare them.	Zan je in shirya su.
She is beautiful.	Ta yi kyau.
But how wrong it can be.	Amma yaya kuskure zai iya zama.
Not if we can help him.	Ba idan za mu iya taimaka masa ba.
We can't do anything with it here.	Ba za mu iya yin komai da shi a nan ba.
It may not be so good.	Yana iya zama haka ba kyau sosai ba.
I have never seen anything like it.	Ban taba ganin irin sa ba.
Give it to me, he said.	Ka ba ni shi, ya ce.
They did not pay attention at first, but the man looked	Ba su kula da farko ba, amma mutumin ya duba
You will be safe here.	Za ku kasance lafiya a nan.
She was completely killed.	An kashe ta gaba daya.
And when he gets there, he does something.	Kuma idan ya isa wurin, sai ya yi wani abu.
I do not remember anything there.	Ban tuna komai a wurin.
She had never seen this before.	Ba ta taba ganin wannan ba.
And, some are.	Kuma, wasu suna.
No one will be seen.	Ba za a ga kowa ba.
I agree with you here.	Na yarda da ku a nan.
Nothing like that.	Ba abin da ya yi kama.
These are definitely my favorites.	Waɗannan su ne shakka na fi so.
He loves to look at women.	Yana son kallon mata.
It may go a little further than that, though.	Yana iya tafiya kadan fiye da haka, ko da yake.
It's very sad.	Yana da matukar bakin ciki.
And he gets what comes next.	Kuma yana samun abin da ya zo.
They will learn how it works a little.	Za su koyi yadda yake aiki kaɗan.
Let it be so.	Bari ya kasance haka.
But he could not bring himself to do so.	Amma ya kasa kawo kansa don yin hakan.
He himself felt ill.	Shi kansa ya ji rashin lafiya.
He was tired, but he could not sleep.	Ya gaji, duk da haka ya kasa barci.
I do not know when or how this will happen.	Ban san yaushe ko ta yaya hakan zai faru ba.
This surprised me.	Wannan ya bani mamaki.
And many more.	Kuma da yawa.
This is nothing new.	Wannan ba sabon abu ba ne.
I did not get it.	ban samu ba.
I can't make her hear me.	Ba zan iya sa ta ji ni ba.
If the car overheats, it will cry.	Idan motar ta yi yawa, zai yi kuka.
Today he is gone.	Yau ba ya nan.
You haven't seen anything yet.	Ba ka ga komai ba tukuna.
He calls often.	Yana kira sau da yawa.
Right upstairs.	Dama zuwa sama.
I remember doing that.	Na tuna yin haka.
Since then, he has not been able to make progress in life.	Tun daga lokacin, ya kasa samun ci gaba a rayuwa.
This is not fair.	Wannan bai dace ba.
Every effort will be made.	Za a yi kowane ƙoƙari.
Probably so.	Wataƙila an yi tsammanin hakan.
You are not enough.	Baka isa ba.
Well it was a school day.	Da kyau ranar makaranta ce.
And he never got it, though.	Kuma bai taba samun ba, amma.
When in doubt.	Lokacin da ake shakka.
You didn't get a word.	Baka samu magana ba.
And it still hasn't come.	Kuma har yanzu bata zo ba.
Life must go on.	Dole ne rayuwa ta ci gaba.
I didn't get that.	Ban samu wannan ba.
And he did not know what to do.	Kuma bai san me zai yi ba.
We were amazed at how you became.	Mun yi mamakin yadda kuka zama.
I'm not made the way you are.	Ba a sanya ni yadda kuke ba.
He is OK.	Yana lafiya.
I don't even care. 	Ban ma damu ba.

She told me everything.	Ta gaya min komai.
But he does not go to war.	Amma baya shiga fada.
I think trying to figure out what the biggest will be.	Ina tsammanin ƙoƙarin gano abin da mafi girma zai kasance.
I'd like to stay, for more information.	Ina so in zauna, don ƙarin ji.
For many people, their job is just what they get.	Ga mutane da yawa, aikin su shine kawai abin da suke samu.
Two years, maybe three.	Shekaru biyu, watakila uku.
She caught him getting ready to leave the house.	Ta kama shi yana shirin barin gidan.
And we love it too.	Kuma mu ma muna son shi.
I never agreed.	Ban taba yarda ba.
He is right there in every person.	Yana nan daidai, a cikin kowane mutum.
I will not tell anyone.	Ba zan gaya wa kowa ba.
But he never got it.	Amma bai taba samu ba.
This closes without difficulty.	Wannan ya rufe ba tare da wahala ba.
No one wants the truth.	Babu mai son gaskiya.
They will not do you any good.	Ba za su yi maka da kyau ba.
I live in a country house.	Ina zaune a gidan kasa.
I'm not comfortable here.	Ba ni da dadi a nan.
The task was simple.	Aikin ya kasance mai sauƙi.
It turns out it's all true.	Ya nuna duk gaskiya ne.
Help can reach them quickly.	Taimako zai iya zuwa gare su da sauri.
You can't talk and get to know each other there.	Ba za ku iya magana da sanin juna a can ba.
This made him very sad.	Hakan ya bata masa rai.
I should be able to do this.	Ya kamata in iya yin wannan.
Some will not see, but we see.	Wasu ba za su gani ba, amma muna gani.
You have a good job.	Kuna da kyakkyawan aiki.
But he is an unusual man.	Amma shi mutum ne da ba a saba gani ba.
I never thought much about it.	Ban taba tunani da yawa game da shi ba.
But of course you do not know me.	Amma tabbas ba ku san ni ba.
The food was delicious.	Abincin ya kasance mai ban sha'awa.
I would never put my hand around it in the afternoon.	Ba zan taɓa sa hannu na a kusa da shi da rana ba.
I know you read well.	Na san kuna karatu sosai.
It can be anyone.	Zai iya zama kowa.
Keep doing it.	Ku ci gaba da yi.
So you know how we fly early.	Don haka kun san yadda muke tashi da wuri.
There is no way he can do that.	Babu yadda zai iya yin haka.
We agree with this statement.	Mun yarda da wannan magana.
There is success.	Akwai nasara.
I heard he was married.	Na ji yayi aure.
I could not see the rest of it.	Ban iya ganin sauran shi ba.
That brought me back to the world.	Wannan ya dawo da ni duniya.
No story to try.	Babu labarin da za a yi ƙoƙari.
As they were leaving, the door of the house opened.	Suna fita, kofar da ta shiga gidan ta bude.
Not much, perhaps, but some.	Ba yawa, watakila, amma wasu.
One is the great land.	Daya ita ce kasa mai girma.
I have them.	Ina da su.
She didn't feel well.	Ba ta ji dadi ba.
Do not do this again.	Kar a sake yin wannan.
But he does not really feel it.	Amma ba ya jin gaske.
That would definitely make me travel.	Wannan da gaske zai sa ni tafiya.
I'm not very interested.	Ba ni da sha'awa da yawa.
Something is happening with this thing.	Wani abu yana faruwa da wannan abu.
If you try to do something, you will do it	Idan kun yi ƙoƙarin yin wani abu, za ku yi
The food is very good.	Abincin yayi kyau sosai.
We want to do.	Muna son yin.
They don’t get a chance to run to play.	Ba sa samun damar gudu su yi wasa.
I learned this in a fun way.	Na koyi wannan a hanya mai ban dariya.
We use this as follows.	Muna amfani da wannan kamar haka.
Their whereabouts are unknown.	Ba a san inda suke kwana ba.
They know nothing.	Ba su san komai ba.
So, they were right.	Don haka, sun yi daidai.
I let him leave me twice behind.	Na bar shi ya bar ni sau biyu a baya.
I hurried out of the restaurant.	Na fita da sauri daga gidan abinci.
I have a pain	Ina jin zafi
This is the future.	Wannan shi ne gaba.
No one took, except one.	Babu wanda ya dauka, sai daya.
He raises her hand.	Ya daga mata hannu.
So do you.	Haka ku ma.
The whole house is gone.	Duk gidan ya tafi.
We will never touch such a thing, not easily.	Ba za mu taɓa irin wannan abu ba, ba da sauƙi ba.
That we do so is amazing.	Cewa mu yi haka abin ban mamaki ne.
I personally know a lot of women.	Ni da kaina na san da yawa daga cikin mata.
I want to talk.	Ina so in yi magana.
They stood looking at us and we passed them.	Suka tsaya suna kallon mu muka wuce su.
That can seem like a lot of time.	Hakan na iya zama kamar lokaci mai yawa.
That is why it is.	Shi ya sa abin yake.
So interesting.	Don haka abin sha'awa ne.
Let's see what happens.	Bari mu ga abin da ya faru.
It will not pass him by.	Ba zai wuce shi ba.
The reason was not immediately clear.	Ba a bayyana dalilin ba nan da nan.
This is not the first time.	Ba haka ba ne karo na farko.
It has not changed the world.	Ba ta canza duniya ba.
You, however, do not.	Kai, duk da haka, kada ka yi.
Do we really need a restaurant?	Shin muna buƙatar wani gidan cin abinci da gaske?
It was really cool.	Shi ne ainihin sanyi.
An interesting one.	Wani mai ban sha'awa.
And when the sun came up.	Kuma lokacin da rana ta fito.
They do it right there.	Suna yin shi daidai a can.
Homework was hard for me.	Aikin gida ya yi mini wuya.
Maybe he will do the same thing.	Wataƙila zai yi abu ɗaya.
Immediately before she died.	Nan take kafin ta mutu.
I did not eat for two days.	Kwana biyu ban ci abinci ba.
That's the way it is.	Haka abin yake.
How fast kids grow up!	Yaya da sauri yara girma!
I think people will see.	Ina tsammanin mutane za su gani.
To our name.	Zuwa sunan mu.
If that doesn't work, go here for more help.	Idan hakan bai yi aiki ba, je nan don ƙarin taimako.
Actually, it is not.	A gaskiya, ba haka ba ne.
Checked but not waited.	An duba amma ba a jira ba.
Check it out though.	Duba shi ko da yake.
Fish and you still.	Kifi da kai har yanzu.
We can talk about it sometimes.	Za mu iya magana game da shi wani lokaci.
He later forgot where to park the car.	Daga baya ya manta inda ya ajiye motar.
I hope you find some things you enjoy.	Ina fatan za ku sami wasu abubuwan da kuke jin daɗi.
And it was cut.	Kuma aka yanke.
If you already know it, great.	Idan kun riga kun san shi, mai girma.
I don't care about anything.	Ban damu da komai ba.
Do not look down!	Kar ka kalli kasa!
It will be easy to find.	Zai zama da sauƙi a samu.
You know how it is.	Kun san yadda take.
You know you can.	Kun san za ku iya.
I will not let you sleep with anyone.	Ba zan bar ku ku kwana da wani ba.
But then they started killing us.	Amma sai suka fara kashe mu.
I want to do it for myself.	Ina so in yi wa kaina.
So, everything is edible.	Don haka, duk abin da ake ci.
And that is what they need.	Kuma abin da suke bukata ke nan.
I worked with this.	Na yi aiki da wannan.
He did not know where she was.	Bai san inda take ba.
I hope people find the book useful.	Ina fata mutane suna ganin littafin yana da amfani.
He could not walk properly.	Ya kasa tafiya yadda ya kamata.
They saw each other a lot.	Sun ga juna da yawa.
No one does it.	Babu mai yin ta.
You are not here right now.	Babu kai a nan a yanzu.
It feels comfortable in the hand.	Yana jin dadi a hannu.
Maybe give it a little time.	Wataƙila ya ba da ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
You are just a tool.	Kai kayan aiki ne kawai.
Not a success.	Ba cin nasara ba.
You have to see for yourself.	Dole ne ku gani da kanku.
No one is around.	Babu kowa a kusa.
I know it's a lot faster.	Na san yana da sauri da yawa.
I can't tell you when.	Ba zan iya gaya muku yaushe ba.
Anything made to stop fighting.	Duk abin da aka sanya shi daina fada.
They like to talk about beauty.	Suna son yin magana game da kyau.
They need immediate help.	Suna buƙatar samun taimako nan take.
I'm afraid of what they can do.	Ina tsoron abin da za su iya yi.
Don't think of me otherwise.	Kar ka bani tunanin in ba haka ba.
We must also look to the future.	Dole ne mu kuma duba ga nan gaba.
They were great.	Sun kasance masu girma.
If there are people around you call for help.	Idan akwai mutane a kusa da ku kira taimako.
Start by filling it with fresh water.	Fara da cika shi da ruwa mai dadi.
She is very worried about this.	Ta damu sosai da wannan.
We can help !.	Za mu iya taimaka!.
They always laugh together.	Kullum sai dariya suke yi tare.
You cannot remove me.	Ba za ku iya cire ni ba.
No more food.	Babu sauran abinci.
The lawsuit continued.	An ci gaba da yin kara.
There he was alone.	A can ne shi kaɗai.
The cold season was very hot.	Lokacin sanyi ya kasance yana da zafi sosai.
To be sad does not necessarily mean to be healthy.	Don zama bakin ciki ba lallai ba ne ya zama lafiya.
Before she knew something was wrong.	Kafin ta san wani abu ba daidai ba.
I personally would like to do it at some point.	Ni da kaina zan so in yi shi a wani lokaci.
And it doesn't seem to be.	Kuma da alama ba haka bane.
And if we stay here, we die too.	Kuma idan muka zauna a nan, mu mutu ma.
They did everything they were asked to do.	Sun yi duk abin da aka tambaye su.
About you, about me.	Game da ku, game da ni.
I miss that.	Na rasa hakan.
It's great, really.	Yana da girma, da gaske.
So, it worked and it worked well.	Don haka, ya yi aiki kuma ya yi aiki da kyau.
However, this would be a big mistake.	Duk da haka, wannan zai zama babban kuskure.
She was amazing.	Ta kasance mai ban mamaki.
Now he is very sick.	Yanzu ya yi rashin lafiya sosai.
So go ahead.	Don haka ci gaba.
This has been fixed.	An gyara wannan.
He will play well, this will.	Zai yi wasa mai kyau, wannan zai.
She sells everything in the world.	Ta sayar da duk abin duniya.
At night.	A cikin dare.
But it was about.	Amma ya kasance game.

Maybe you are.	Wataƙila kai ne.
At that time, the next, the next.	A wannan lokacin, da na gaba, da na gaba.
What does the story say?	Me kuma labarin ya ce?.
I have to put that behind myself.	Dole ne in sanya hakan a bayan kaina.
She's never been here before.	Ta taba nan sai kawai ta yi.
The car went off on time.	Motar ta tafi akan lokaci.
He did not write anything for three days.	Bai rubuta komai ba kwana uku.
And maybe it was for you.	Kuma watakila ya kasance a gare ku.
Time and progress still stand here.	Lokaci da ci gaba sun tsaya har yanzu a nan.
You got mine.	Ka samu nawa.
She kept waiting.	Ta ci gaba da jira.
It is good to know someone is on things.	Yana da kyau a san wani yana kan abubuwa.
We lived in the same house for many years.	Mun yi shekaru da yawa a gida ɗaya.
You must have found a surprise.	Dole ne ku sami abin mamaki.
I want you to go	Ina so ku tafi
Doesn't she do a good job?	Shin ba ta yin aiki mai kyau?
There is no such thing in it.	Babu irin wannan abu a ciki.
She always had breakfast in the morning.	Kullum da safe take cin abincin safe.
This is for sure.	Wannan tabbas.
I do not know how to do this.	Ban san yadda zan yi wannan ba.
Things should start all the time.	Ya kamata a fara abubuwa kowane lokaci.
Of course this is nothing new.	Tabbas wannan ba sabon abu bane.
The same every day of the week.	Haka kuma kowace rana cikin mako.
You told me so.	Kun gaya mani haka.
I tell you this is true.	Ina gaya muku wannan gaskiya ne.
It is too hot to work today.	Yana da zafi da yawa don yin aiki a yau.
Not everyone gets that opportunity.	Kowa ba ya samun wannan damar.
It is time to do something already.	Lokaci ya yi da za a yi wani abu riga.
We must make mistakes sometimes.	Dole ne mu yi kuskure wani lokaci.
No one can prove anything.	Babu wanda zai iya tabbatar da wani abu.
I have to speak.	Dole na yi magana.
After each name.	Bayan kowane suna.
I'm leaving now.	Zan tafi yanzu.
He was and will never be.	Ya kasance ba kuma ba zai taba zama ba.
They are well made.	An yi su da kyau.
That's the way it is with everyone.	Haka kowa yake.
But it's not funny.	Amma abin ban dariya ba haka bane.
Of course he loves her.	Tabbas yana son ta.
This is what they do.	Wannan shi ne abin da suke yi.
No help needed.	Babu taimako da ya kamata.
Our car has been repaired.	An gyara motar mu.
He said he just made sure there was no problem.	Ya ce kawai ya tabbatar babu matsala.
People live in many places.	Mutane suna zama a wurin da yawa.
I never told you that.	Ban taba gaya muku haka ba.
She felt inwardly that something was wrong.	Ta ji a ciki cewa wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
We want to spend more time with them.	Muna so mu ƙara lokaci tare da su.
it is selfish.	son kai ne na.
It was close but not really.	Ya kusa amma ba sosai ba.
She doesn't even know what to do if she does.	Ba ta ma san me za ta yi ba idan ta yi.
It was a great place to do the work.	Ya kasance wuri mai kyau don yin aikin.
Get in the car.	Motar ku tafi.
Say he called me.	Ka ce ya kira ni.
I knew it would happen.	Na san zai faru.
It's all the same.	Duk daya ne.
Maybe he knew him personally.	Wataƙila ya san shi da kansa.
Everyone looked.	Kowa ya duba.
Let's start today.	Bari mu fara yau.
We are not troubleshooting.	Ba mu yin gyara matsala.
There was a great man.	Akwai wani mutum mai girma.
It is not difficult to hear.	Babu wuya ji.
He could not get out.	Ya kasa fita.
I recommend this.	Ina ba da shawarar wannan.
This is a good thing to do, he told himself.	Wannan abu ne mai kyau a yi, ya gaya wa kansa.
He slept through the night.	Ya kwana da dare.
I told him not to talk.	Na ce masa kar ya yi magana.
Forget and forget the so-called world.	Manta kuma ku manta da abin da ake kira duniya.
When true.	Lokacin da gaskiya .
I don’t know if this could work.	Ban sani ba ko wannan zai iya aiki.
So it has to be right.	Don haka dole ne ya zama daidai.
So they do not know where to look.	Don haka ba su san inda za su duba ba.
Too much sleep.	Barci da yawa.
They were not made for that.	Ba a yi su don haka ba.
Surprisingly she could not remember what.	Abin ban mamaki cewa ba za ta iya tuna menene ba.
We will never be happy again.	Ba za mu sake yin farin ciki ba.
I feel at home	Ina jin gida
There is nothing to do.	Babu wani abu da za a yi.
I closed it.	Na rufe shi.
I don’t want you to get involved in what’s going on right now.	Ba na son ku shiga cikin abin da ke faruwa a yanzu.
We decided to go with our plan.	Mun yanke shawarar tafiya da shirin da muke da shi.
He will do the same for her.	Zai yi mata daya.
Do not play with materials.	Kar a yi wasa da kayan.
People will tell you how they feel about it.	Mutane za su gaya muku yadda suke ji game da shi.
But that was a problem for one day.	Amma wannan ya kasance matsala ga wata rana.
I can see everything in myself exactly.	Ina iya ganin kowane abu a kaina daidai.
Truth is a painful word.	Gaskiya magana ce mai zafi.
She agrees with me.	Ta yarda da ni.
He ate well.	Ya ci abinci da jin daɗi.
It can't be real.	Ba zai iya zama da gaske ba.
I just love you.	Ina son ku kawai.
She decided it was time to leave.	Ta yanke shawarar lokaci ya yi da za ta fita daga wurin.
Love this person.	Son wannan mutumin.
Not even for me.	Ba ma a gare ni ba.
More than one person.	Fiye da mutum ɗaya.
This is a way of thinking in the past.	Wannan wata hanya ce ta tunani a baya.
My time is up.	Lokaci na ya kare.
All the time.	Kowane lokaci.
I hope you will have a long life together.	Ina fatan za ku yi tsawon rai tare.
However, he does not tell me anything.	Duk da haka, ba ya gaya mani komai.
It may take up to a day or two.	Yana iya ɗaukar kusan kwana ɗaya ko biyu.
That's not what we want.	Ba abin da muke so ba kenan.
Open it how.	Bude shi ta yaya.
Maybe I'll pay more.	Wataƙila zan ƙara biya.
Or one of the best.	Ko daya daga cikin mafi kyau.
You do not.	Ba ku yin haka.
But it was one of those nights.	Amma yana ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan dare.
People care and know each other.	Mutane suna kula kuma sun san juna.
We kill him.	Muna kashe shi.
He had to come back so later.	Dole ne ya dawo don haka daga baya.
It would be better that way.	Zai fi kyau haka.
Release her.	Ka sake ta.
Until you are used to doing everything.	Har sai kun saba yin komai.
However, it is not the least.	Duk da haka, ba ko kadan ba ne.
I want to leave something good.	Ina so in bar wani abu mai kyau.
Just to be honest or no doubt.	Sai kawai don ya zama mai gaskiya ko shakka babu.
I do not know how they do it.	Ban san yadda suke yi ba.
It felt like one.	Ya ji kamar daya.
I felt happy again.	Na sake jin farin ciki.
No work, you say.	Babu aiki, ka ce.
I caught something from that moment.	Na kama wani abu daga wannan lokacin.
She laughed at me.	Ta bani dariya.
They may not like it but may not be able to help it.	Wataƙila ba za su so shi ba amma ba za su iya taimaka masa ba.
He may be wrong, but he assumes that he is right.	Yana iya zama ba daidai ba, amma ya ɗauka cewa daidai ne.
I worked there.	Na yi aiki a can.
I gave them all one.	Na ba su duka daya.
I gave it a run.	Na ba shi da gudu.
To be the best.	Don zama mafi kyau.
I am common	Ni na kowa
You always lie.	Kuna yin karya koyaushe.
But they are not enough.	Amma ba su isa ba.
One that should be seen.	Wanda ya kamata a gani.
You may be surprised at what comes to you.	Kuna iya mamakin abin da ya zo muku.
But it is a joy.	Amma abin farin ciki ne.
Go home now and enjoy yourself.	Ku koma gida yanzu za ku ji daɗi.
Let's do what she says let's go.	Mu yi abin da ta ce mu tafi.
And that will probably take years.	Kuma da alama hakan zai ɗauki shekaru.
So, he decided to go there.	Don haka, ya yanke shawarar zuwa wurin.
Eat what you like.	Ku ci abin da kuke so.
Next time he hopes to think twice.	Lokaci na gaba yana fatan zai yi tunani sau biyu .
You will die if you do not do something.	Za ku mutu idan ba ku yi wani abu ba.
It cannot be finished.	Ba za a iya gama shi ba.
What happened, happened.	Abin da ya faru, ya faru.
What is not good is that it is hard to find.	Abin da ba shi da kyau shi ne cewa yana da wuya a samu.
Everything is fine.	Komai na da kyau.
He never touched me all that time.	Bai taba taba ni ba duk tsawon lokacin.
We can't get married.	Ba za mu iya yin aure ba.
You have met them before.	Kun hadu da su a baya.
Only things you know and do not see.	Abubuwan da kuke sani kawai kuma ba ku gani ba.
Knowing the events must be in the future.	Sanin abubuwan da suka faru dole ne su kasance a nan gaba.
I can always leave.	Zan iya barin ko da yaushe.
He does not know us.	Bai san mu ba ne.
This is what they did not tell you.	Wannan shi ne abin da ba su gaya muku ba.
Now, let me explain.	Yanzu, bari in bayyana.
She called him and said don't worry he came.	Ta kira shi ta ce kar ya damu ya zo.
Maybe I should explain this.	Wataƙila ya kamata in bayyana wannan.
He did not know.	Bai sani ba.
He was later than usual, he could say.	Ya kasance daga baya fiye da yadda aka saba, zai iya fada.
People will die.	Mutane za su mutu.
Do a little reading.	Yi ɗan karatu.
Walk to him.	Tafiya zuwa gare shi.
They do not come to me very quickly.	Ba sa zuwa gare ni da sauri sosai.
No problem yet.	Babu matsala har yanzu.
Too much for one person.	Ya yi yawa ga mutum ɗaya.
They are in trouble.	Suna cikin wahala.
Now hurry up!	Yanzu ku yi sauri!
I have to be here.	Dole ne in kasance a nan.
I will stand for myself.	Zan tsaya wa kaina.
Not me anymore.	Ba ni kuma.
We do not know whether to accept it or not.	Ba mu san ko mu yarda da shi ko a'a.
Nothing like that.	Ba abin da ya yi kama.
It is not used.	Ba a yi amfani da shi ba.
But there is nothing she can do about it.	Amma babu abin da za ta iya yi game da shi.
He will not live alone.	Ba zai zauna shi kadai ba.
Somehow it is not much now.	Ko ta yaya ba shi da yawa a yanzu.
I really do.	Ina da gaske.
No one ever said anything.	Babu wanda ya taɓa cewa komai.
I do not know how to study.	Ban san yadda zan yi karatu ba.
When I need to play, and write the way.	Lokacin da nake buƙatar wasa, kuma rubuta hanya.
He is about to speak for himself now.	Ya kusa magana da kansa yanzu.
I am one.	Ni daya ne.
And we too.	Kuma mu ma.
They gave me two things.	Abu biyu suka bani.
It is a cold drink, a sweet drink.	Abin sha mai sanyi ne, abin sha mai daɗi.
I expected this.	Na yi tsammanin wannan.
But it happens often enough to be familiar.	Amma yana faruwa sau da yawa isa ya zama saba.
People really need this.	Mutane suna buƙatar wannan da gaske.
It's time to go to school.	Lokacin zuwa makaranta yayi.
And nothing happened.	Kuma babu abin da ya faru.
Some people will be killed.	Za a kashe wasu mutane.
It was a great trip.	Tafiya ce mai girma.
This once worked well, but now it has not worked.	Wannan ya taɓa yin aiki yadda ya kamata, amma yanzu bai yi aiki ba.
That is not true.	Hakan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Here we stop.	Nan muka tsaya.
He explained what happened, he said.	Ya bayyana abin da ya faru, ya ce.
I want to be honest with you.	Ina so in sami gaskiya tare da ku.
I will be that person.	Zan zama wannan mutumin.
I care about it.	Na damu da shi.
We have no use for it.	Ba mu da wani amfani gare shi.
It looks amazing.	Yana kama da ban mamaki.
And so it is to this day.	Kuma haka yake har yau.
It seems that many people are missing out on something worthwhile.	Da alama mutane da yawa sun rasa abin da ya dace.
There is no need to be afraid.	Babu bukatar jin tsoro.
I want to know what is going on here.	Ina so in san abin da ke faruwa a nan.
There he tells her he can't.	Can kuma yana gaya mata ba zai iya ba.
It did not spread.	Bata fad'a ba.
The collision started.	An fara yin karo.
There is nothing to impress anyone.	Babu wani abu don sha'awar kowa.
He did not mind doing so.	Bai damu da yin haka ba.
He was curious.	Ya kasance mai son sani.
Seriously he had to cover his mouth.	Da gaske dole ne ya rufe bakin.
You have it.	Kuna da shi.
I felt it was good.	Na ji yana da kyau.
So much more.	Don haka fiye da haka.
I know why.	Na san dalilin haka ne.
Sad but true.	Bakin ciki amma gaskiya.
She could not understand why it did not work properly.	Ta kasa gane dalilin da yasa baya aiki yadda ya kamata.
But this is a big deal really.	Amma wannan babban abin da gaske ne.
However, it is good.	Duk da haka, yana da kyau.
This does not always happen.	Hakan bai saba faruwa ba.
But there is still money in place.	Amma har yanzu akwai kudi a wurin.
We can help you find one.	Za mu iya taimaka muku samun daya.
This happens often.	Wannan yana faruwa sau da yawa.
I am still there.	Har yanzu ina can.
I care about you.	Na damu da ku.
Or they will say nothing.	Ko kuma ba za su ce komai ba.
The wait time never really arrived.	Lokacin jira bai taɓa zuwa da gaske ba.
But at the same time it changed everything.	Amma a lokaci guda ya canza komai.
Or kill him.	Ko kashe shi.
I knew he knew everything about me.	Na san cewa ya san komai game da ni.
Maybe he did it this year.	Wataƙila ya yi hakan a wannan shekara.
Make sure they are amazing.	Tabbatar cewa suna da ban mamaki.
The dining room.	Da dakin cin abinci.
You will not have a problem.	Ba za ku sami matsala ba.
It should work.	Ya kamata yayi aiki.
Two things can happen from here.	Abubuwa biyu na iya faruwa daga nan.
You will be fine.	Za ku lafiya.
Many people know.	Mutane da yawa sun sani.
So they have to remove it.	Don haka dole ne su cire shi.
I learned a lot about sports and life.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa game da wasan da rayuwa.
Children need to understand what is right and what is wrong.	Yara suna bukatar su fahimci abin da ke daidai da abin da ba daidai ba.
This went on for a while.	Wannan ya ci gaba na ɗan lokaci.
But the sun did rise.	Amma rana ta tashi.
Will you buy it?	Za ku saya?
Don't worry, it's not about that.	Kada ku damu, ba game da wannan ba.
You must do this several times a day.	Dole ne ku yi haka sau da yawa har zuwa rana.
Of course, there must be a better way.	Tabbas, dole ne a sami hanya mafi kyau.
I have to say.	Dole in ce.
This man spoke many times.	Wannan mutumin sau da yawa ya yi magana.
You're late to school!	Kun makara zuwa makaranta!
For other people she must be fine.	Ga sauran mutane dole ne ta zama lafiya.
We hope this money is back now.	Muna fatan wannan kudi ya dawo yanzu.
Stop being rude.	A daina rashin hankali.
Easy to marvel at how she came to this.	Sauƙi don mamakin yadda ta zo ga wannan.
We started walking as he told me so.	Muka fara tafiya kamar yadda yake gaya mani haka.
That's all.	Shi ke nan gaba daya.
All of these things are funny.	Duk waɗannan abubuwan suna da ban dariya.
He was immediately arrested.	Nan take aka kama shi.
We care.	Mu kula.
It's one now.	Yana da daya yanzu.
Obviously, they do not have time.	Babu shakka, ba su da lokaci.
There is no such thing.	Babu irin wannan abu.
To me, it didn't work out.	A gare ni, bai yi daidai ba.
What we only know we are talking about.	Abin da muka sani kawai muke magana.
We are talking about fighting.	Muna magana ne game da fada.
Of course not.	Tabbas ba haka bane.
Cut into strips.	Yanke cikin kara.
They will not even know such a thing.	Ba za su ma san irin wannan abu ba.
We hope you will be with us !.	Muna fatan za ku kasance tare da mu!.
Let's say your name comes out.	Bari mu ce sunan ku ya fito.
He won't tell me anything.	Ba zai gaya mani komai ba.
But, of course, we still have this year.	Amma, ba shakka, har yanzu muna da wannan shekara.
Yet one thing is certain.	Amma duk da haka abu ɗaya ya tabbata.
We can't have that.	Ba za mu iya samun hakan ba.
He was right.	Ya yi daidai.
They can break easily.	Suna iya karya cikin sauƙi.
I wonder if it will make me laugh.	Ina tunanin ko zai min dariya.
Maybe she was right.	Wataƙila ta yi gaskiya.
It was very interesting.	Ya kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
No man, nothing.	Babu mutum, sai wani abu.
You love the one you love.	Kuna son wanda kuke so.
Someone has to do it.	Dole ne wani ya yi.
So it was all morning, all day, all night.	Haka ta kasance duk da safe, duk rana, dare.
How could she forget.	Yaya zata manta.
This water can be drunk.	Ana iya sha wannan ruwan.
They don't care about us.	Ba su kula mu ba.
But he is doing the work.	Amma yana yin aikin.
It all started well.	Duk ya fara da kyau.
It will continue when you get up.	Za a ci gaba idan kun tashi.
It is enough to be near the place.	Ya isa ya kasance kusa da wurin.
There is still no one.	Har yanzu babu kowa.
It was all cold there.	Shi duk yayi sanyi a wurin.
It is not enough at best.	Bai isa ba a mafi kyau.
In fact it was more than making coffee.	A gaskiya ya kasance fiye da yin kofi.
But he knew he did.	Amma ya san ya yi.
She doesn't need to.	Ba ta bukata.
It can not be.	Ba zai iya zama ba.
But there is no more of this from now on.	Amma babu sauran wannan daga yanzu.
And it appears to be true.	Kuma ya bayyana yana da gaskiya.
He played and finished.	Ya yi wasa ya gama.
But to no avail.	Amma ba shi da wani amfani.
But, there is no benefit.	Amma, babu wani amfani.
Others do not care where they go.	Wasu kuma ba su damu da inda za su ba.
I decided that they were right.	Na yanke shawarar cewa suna da gaskiya.
And they stand on everything.	Kuma sun tsaya a kan komai.
Others are on the way.	Wasu kuma suna kan hanya.
I don't even know how he feels.	Ban ma san yadda yake ji ba.
We describe it below.	Mun bayyana shi a kasa.
Will water come?	Ruwa zai zo?
This can be heard.	Ana iya jin wannan.
It’s harder than it looks, and it takes a lot of time.	Yana da wuya fiye da yadda yake gani, kuma yana ɗaukar lokaci mai yawa.
I have to work.	Dole ne in yi aiki.
I have not had coffee yet.	Ban sha kofi ba tukuna.
The thought behind this work is terrifying.	Tunanin da ke bayan wannan aikin yana da ban tsoro.
I'm not sure what I'm doing is wrong.	Ban tabbata abin da nake yi ba daidai ba ne.
Definitely should.	Babu shakka ya kamata.
She is used to it.	Ta saba da hakan.
But they would not want a surprise.	Amma ba za su so abin mamaki ba.
It has never happened to me and not since.	Ban taba faruwa da ni ba kuma ba tun daga lokacin ba.
If she can’t do much of it, they can.	Idan ba za ta iya yin yawa daga ciki ba, za su iya.
It took three days.	Sai da aka yi kwana uku.
This is not a lie.	Wannan ba karya bane.
So there is something there.	Don haka akwai wani abu a can.
I'm really interested.	Ina sha'awar gaske.
He will write more.	Zai rubuta ƙarin.
I know it's weird, though.	Na san abin mamaki ne, amma.
He has been really thinking of you today.	Ya kasance yana tunanin ku a yau da gaske.
It is very good to feel like there is nothing in this world.	Yana da matukar kyau ji kamar babu wani abu a cikin wannan duniya.
They made a big mistake.	Sun yi kuskure sosai.
They did it all.	Suka yi mata duka da .
Maybe that would be fine, though.	Wataƙila hakan zai yi kyau, ko da yake.
I think.	Ina tunani.
He knows that it makes people happy.	Ya san cewa yana sa mutane farin ciki.
And he knew what had happened, even though he could not explain it.	Kuma ya san abin da ya faru, ko da ba zai iya bayyana shi ba.
Life is over.	An gama da rayuwa.
I will try this again.	Zan sake gwada wannan.
He did not wait for an answer.	Bai jira amsa ba.
I feel a lot of pain.	Na ji zafi sosai.
But let me see.	Amma bari in gani.
It proved to be fast and accurate.	Ya tabbatar yana da sauri kuma daidai.
Slowly she ate.	A hankali ta ci abinci.
Nothing more.	Babu wani abu kuma.
And of course you have.	Kuma tabbas kuna da.
I didn't feel anything at night.	Ban ji komai ba a daren.
But do not take it.	Amma kar a ɗauka.
They said he got out of the car.	Suka ce ya fito daga motar.
Of course not.	Tabbas, ba haka bane.
You have never been seriously ill or injured.	Ba ku taɓa yin mummunan rashin lafiya ko rauni ba.
They took three girls.	Sun dauki yan mata uku kenan.
They feel enough, of course.	Suna jin isa, ba shakka.
He was the best man there.	Shi ne mafi kyawun mutum a wurin.
Or they may be telling you something that is not true.	Ko kuma sun gaya maka wani abu da ba gaskiya ba.
It has helped me a lot.	Ya taimake ni da yawa.
This should not come as a surprise to anyone.	Wannan bai kamata ya zama abin mamaki ga kowa ba.
Go and make it happen.	Ku tafi ku sa abin ya faru.
No wonder.	Babu mamaki.
I try not to think about it.	Ina ƙoƙarin kada in yi tunani game da haka.
We suffered so much together, the three of us.	Mun sha wahala sosai tare, mu uku.
She looked at the oil.	Ta duba mai.
But it is not so.	Amma shi ba haka bane.
But maybe that's a good thing.	Amma watakila wannan abu ne mai kyau.
He was in the past.	Ya kasance a baya.
You will stop here.	Za ku tsaya a nan.
He then began to narrate his three favorite things.	Daga nan ya fara ba da labarin abubuwan da ya fi so guda uku.
I watched this beautiful movie.	Na kalli wannan kyakkyawan fim ɗin.
The water they drank was cold.	Ruwan da suka sha yayi sanyi.
I want to hear.	Ina so in ji.
Someone who is not ready to show himself.	Wani wanda bai shirya nuna kansa ba.
He is very sick.	Ya yi rashin lafiya sosai.
I will talk to other people.	Zan yi magana da wasu mutane.
It is a pleasure to read it.	Abin farin ciki ne karanta shi.
One problem is not true.	Matsalar daya ce ba gaskiya bane.
Can you eat yet?	Za ku iya ci tukuna?
No one has ever been to a movie alone.	Babu wanda ya taɓa zuwa fim shi kaɗai.
They buy everything.	Suna siyan komai.
I hope it works.	Ina fata yana aiki.
The door is closed.	Kofar ta rufe.
I'm not kidding.	Ba na wasa.
I called them but there was no answer.	Na kira su amma babu amsa.
They do this year.	Suna yin wannan shekara.
In the rain.	A cikin ruwan sama.
I feel for a child.	Ina ji ga yaro.
He was arrested.	An kama shi.
I'm a little worried.	Na dan damu.
If we go again let us do good about ourselves.	Idan muka sake tafiya bari mu yi kyau game da mu.
The right things are still being done.	Har yanzu ana samun abubuwan da suka dace.
Otherwise you will never see the light of day.	In ba haka ba ba za ku taba ganin dama ba.
No one seems to understand anyone.	Ba wanda yake ganin ya fahimci kowa.
She put it in, of course.	Ta sa shi a ciki, tabbas.
Yes, for everything.	Haka ne, ga komai.
You have really enjoyed yourself here.	Lallai kun yi wa kanku dadi a nan.
He went that way.	Ya yi tafiya haka.
It comes to me too.	Yana zuwa gare ni kuma.
So it has to be true.	Don haka dole ya zama gaskiya.
You buy them.	Kuna saya su.
They must pass.	Dole ne su wuce.
But it continues.	Amma yana ci gaba.
I was happy with my approach.	Na yi farin ciki da hanya ta.
I think she was too much.	Ina tsammanin ta yi yawa da yawa.
But you run.	Amma ka gudu.
He was in the past.	Ya kasance a baya.
You will forget.	Za ku manta.
I really like this.	Ina son wannan sosai.
I found a difficult way that would not work.	Na gano hanya mai wahala cewa ba za ta yi aiki ba.
Until then, have a nice weekend.	Har zuwa lokacin, yi kyakkyawan karshen mako.
I can't see who it is, but someone is there.	Ba zan iya ganin ko wanene ba, amma wani yana can.
That's it, no more.	Shi ke nan, babu kuma.
We did not fix this.	Ba mu gyara wannan ba.
We can get it if we want, of course.	Za mu iya samun ta idan muna so, ba shakka.
Of course I recommend it.	Tabbas ina ba da shawarar shi.
You are and he is not here, yet.	Kai ne kuma ba ya nan, tukuna.
You can have as much time as you want.	Za ku iya samun lokaci kamar yadda kuke so.
Of course not.	Tabbas ba za ku iya ba.
I understand now.	Na gane yanzu.
I'm not interested in having a dog.	Ba ni da sha'awar samun kare.
He did not like it.	Bai so shi ba.
I was wrong.	Na yi kuskure.
No speaker.	Babu mai magana.
I have no reading for this.	Ba ni da wani karatu ga wannan.
Everyone knows it, of course.	Kowa ya san shi, ba shakka.
I still do not recognize him personally, or have started to do so.	Har yanzu ban gane shi da kaina ba, ko kuma na fara yin hakan.
You have to come right.	Dole ku zo daidai.
And it came to me.	Kuma ya zo gare ni.
Any help would be very helpful.	Duk wani taimako zai taimaka sosai.
He can leave himself with it.	Zai iya barin kansa da shi.
And that is a problem.	Kuma wannan matsala ce.
It all fell into place.	Wannan duk ya fada cikin wuri.
I really like that.	Ina son hakan sosai.
Hope to try again after a while.	Da fatan za a yi ƙoƙari bayan ɗan lokaci.
Now, do not forget.	Yanzu, kar a manta.
I gave him a little attention.	Na ba shi hankali kadan.
She has been talking for a long time.	Ta dade tana magana.
Now we know that the material has been cut.	Yanzu mun san cewa an yanke kayan.
It is better not to walk alone.	Zai fi kyau kada ku yi tafiya ku kaɗai.
He can do anything.	Zai iya yin komai.
I am very happy with them !.	Ina matukar farin ciki da su!.
And that is in the story of the next success.	Kuma wannan yana cikin labarin nasara na gaba.
Free of charge.	Ba tare da biya ba.
He did a great job, a great job.	Ya yi babban aiki, babban aiki.
I was wrong about that.	Na yi kuskure game da hakan.
Maybe you weren’t.	Wataƙila ba ku kasance ba.
It was raining, really hard.	An yi ruwan sama, gaske mai wuya.
This is just intelligence.	Wannan kawai hankali ne.
But that cannot be done.	Amma ba za a iya sanya hakan ba.
The man said he had to go to work.	Mutumin ya ce sai ya shiga aiki.
That's how we got it.	Haka muka samu.
But they need to be able to work with you, too.	Amma suna buƙatar samun damar yin aiki tare da ku, kuma.
The moment she touched him she knew.	A take ta taba shi ta sani.
No, he could not remember this game.	A'a, ya kasa tuna wannan wasan.
They can't live without me.	Ba za su iya rayuwa ba tare da ni ba.
And he does not know how to fix it.	Kuma bai san yadda zai gyara ba.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
Not so at this time.	Ba haka ba a wannan lokacin.
Maybe even fear.	Wataƙila ma tsoro.
That is the story.	Haka labarin yake.
It goes right.	Yana tafiya daidai.
And it still does.	Kuma har yanzu yana yi.
So it was.	Haka ta kasance.
He immediately turned on the hot water.	Nan take ya kunna ruwan zafi.
She would never do that.	Ba za ta taɓa yin hakan ba.
This will explain a lot.	Wannan zai bayyana da yawa.
But happy too.	Amma farin ciki kuma.
Sometimes that is fine, and sometimes it doesn't.	Wani lokaci hakan yana da kyau, wani lokacin kuma ba ya yin hakan.
To do these things.	Don yin waɗannan abubuwa.
I give you what you want.	Na ba ku abin da kuke so.
Lots of things.	Abubuwa da yawa.
We have nothing tomorrow.	Ba mu da komai gobe.
Just the two of us.	Mu biyu kawai.
How does that work? 	Ta yaya hakan ke aiki?
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
You might say no.	Wataƙila ka ce a'a.
It will never work.	Ba zai taba aiki ba.
He wore a nice dress for the ceremony.	Ya sa riga mai kyau don bikin.
Therefore, they are not available for immediate use.	Don haka, ba a samun su don amfani nan take.
I helped a little.	Na taimaka dan kadan.
I think	ina ji
This is what happened.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya faru.
Just run.	Gudu kawai.
He will finish killing her somehow.	Zai gama kashe ta ko yaya.
Don't forget it.	Kar a manta da shi.
But no one knew this until it happened.	Amma ba wanda ya san haka har sai abin ya faru.
He would have married her if he had known.	Da ya aure ta in ya sani.
Food was not for her.	Abinci bai mata ba.
He used to do things for me.	Ya kasance yana yi mini abubuwa.
He is very tired.	Ya gaji sosai.
That's what it is.	Shi ne abin da yake.
This is definitely true.	Wannan tabbas gaskiya ne.
He said nothing and she knew who he was.	Bai ce komai ba ta san ko shi wane ne.
Some may recommend more time outdoors.	Wasu na iya ba da shawarar ƙarin lokaci a waje.
Something like that, though.	Wani abu kamar shi, ko da yake.
Suddenly he heard a noise.	Nan take ya ji kara.
Please help me with this.	Don Allah a taimake ni da wannan.
But no, it is true.	Amma a'a, gaskiya ne.
Now you see, now you do not see.	Yanzu kun gani, yanzu ba ku gani.
I think you are not interested.	Ina tsammanin ba ku da sha'awar.
Somehow it's hard to talk to her.	Ko ta yaya ke da wuya yayi mata magana.
They take a little time, but it is not difficult.	Suna ɗan cin lokaci kaɗan, amma ba wuya.
We are who we are.	Mu ne wanda muke.
Everything and everyone will come back.	Komai da kowa zai dawo.
He did not.	Bai yi ba.
He realized she had a job.	Ya fahimci tana da aikin yi.
I can't leave here yet.	Ba zan iya barin nan ba tukuna.
What you are doing is beyond that.	Abin da kuke yi ya wuce haka.
Find a way.	Samu hanya.
It only lasts for a short time.	Ana isa kawai na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Twice and take.	Sau biyu kuma ɗauka.
I don't see anything now.	Bana ganin komai yanzu.
They enjoyed the story.	Sun yi farin ciki da labarin.
Closed, but still with access.	An rufe, amma har yanzu da sauran hanyar shiga.
Seeing the world, living life.	Ganin duniya, rayuwa mai rai.
Don't be a crocodile.	Kada dan kada ne.
Cry and show me.	Kuka da nuna min.
I talked to them all.	Na yi magana da su duka.
And of course, they want to succeed.	Kuma ba shakka, suna son yin nasara.
So she replied.	Haka ta amsa.
The world knows you are good.	Duniya ta san kana da kyau.
This statement is true.	Wannan magana gaskiya ce.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu ya kasance a hankali.
But that feeling is gone now.	Amma wannan jin ya tafi yanzu.
And no one is going to buy it.	Kuma ba wanda zai saya.
I will immediately close them without reading them.	Nan da nan zan rufe su ba tare da karanta su ba.
So, this is a good thing.	Don haka, wannan abu ne mai kyau.
That didn't work very well.	Wannan bai yi aiki sosai ba.
The truth is good.	Gaskiya yayi kyau.
I want to hear from you.	Ina son ji daga bakin ku.
I can find myself.	Zan iya samun kansa.
She is not well.	Ba ta da kyau.
See, if you are going to do this, do it right.	Duba, idan za ku yi wannan, yi daidai.
Use the material.	Yi amfani da kayan abu.
I found almost everything was working.	Na samu kusan komai yana aiki.
Where are we going to spend the night?	A ina za mu kwana a daren nan?
To me, but you know, not really.	A gare ni, amma kun sani, ba da gaske ba.
I beg to differ.	Ban yarda ba.
They were never human.	Ba su taba zama mutum ba.
I don't know who did it.	Ban san wanda ya yi ba.
You must have been married by then.	Lallai ka yi aure a lokacin.
Of course it is a lie.	Ba shakka karya ce.
Success with your work.	Nasara tare da aikin ku.
Right there, right there.	Dama can, dama can.
Fast and easy.	Mai sauri da sauri.
He paused for a moment.	Ya tsaya na ɗan lokaci.
It feels so amazing.	Yana jin ban mamaki sosai.
She always has it.	Kullum tana da shi.
They feel.	Suna ji.
There are no lies here.	Babu karya a nan.
It happens in real life.	Yana faruwa a rayuwa ta gaske.
We also have one here.	Mu ma muna da daya a nan.
This will be done properly.	Za a yi hakan yadda ya kamata.
It grows so much here.	Yana girma sosai a nan.
Both of you go on.	Ku biyu ku ci gaba.
It was written in one day.	An rubuta shi a rana guda.
He stopped.	Ya tsaya.
And this problem is obvious.	Kuma wannan matsala ta bayyana.
There must be a way to make money from it.	Dole ne a sami hanyar samun kuɗi daga ciki.
I have a pain here.	Ina jin zafi a nan.
I did not want him out tonight.	Ban so ya fita daren nan ba.
Not as it seems, you know.	Ba kamar yadda ake gani ba, ka sani.
The whole world.	Duniya gaba daya.
That is why we are, after all.	Wannan shine dalilin sanya mu, bayan haka.
Maybe we should have died.	Wataƙila da mun mutu.
He seems to be interested in this.	Da alama yana sha'awar wannan.
He couldn't believe how he felt inside.	Ya kasa yarda da yadda yake ji a ciki.
We eat food to eat somehow.	Muna cin abincin da za mu ci ko ta yaya.
They were amazing though.	Sun kasance abin mamaki ko da yake.
You know this is true.	Kun san wannan gaskiya ce.
I think now what to do.	Ina ganin yanzu abin da zan yi.
Not often though.	Ba sau da yawa ko da yake.
It makes me do too much for you.	Yana sa na yi maka yawa da yawa.
It's too late for me, now.	Ya makara a gare ni, yanzu.
They are delicious and easy.	Suna da daɗi da sauƙi.
So off they went.	Haka suka tafi tare.
It was an interesting experience.	Ya zama abin ban sha'awa.
I do not lie.	Ba na karya.
She looked very beautiful, but she did not feel comfortable.	Ta yi kyau sosai, amma ba ta ji daɗi ba.
Do not be interested.	Kada ku yi sha'awar.
There is something about her.	Akwai wani abu game da ita.
Prove it.	Tabbatar da hakan.
I do not want to wait.	Ba na son jira.
But think about it.	Amma ka yi tunani game da shi.
I will add.	Zan kara cewa.
At dinner, though, it felt hot.	A abincin dare, ko da yake, ya ji zafi.
But we happened to not like it.	Amma mun faru ba za mu so shi ba.
I did not receive an answer.	Ban sami amsa ba.
Is there time left?	Akwai sauran lokaci?
No one wants me to die.	Ba wanda yake son in mutu.
So you may need to buy one.	Don haka kuna iya buƙatar siyan ɗaya.
It was for the best.	Ya kasance don mafi kyau.
Although in their name, you are still the way.	Ko da yake a cikin sunan su, ku ne har yanzu hanya.
You never know what you're going to get.	Ba za ku taɓa sanin abin da za ku ɗauka ba.
I am not the same.	Ni ba daya bane.
So, hurry up, or we will kill you.	Saboda haka, ka yi sauri, ko mu kashe ka.
You can't go wrong with that.	Ba za ku iya yin kuskure da wannan ba.
He will be there tonight.	Zai kasance a can da daren yau.
For more information.	Don ƙarin sani.
This dog is the greatest of all.	Wannan kare shine mafi girma duka.
We talk to them as human beings.	Muna magana da su kamar mutane ne.
However, it will not be.	Duk da haka, ba zai kasance ba.
He called me forward.	Sai ya kira ni gaba.
However, go ahead.	Duk da haka, ci gaba.
They used it.	Sun yi amfani da shi.
He did so.	Ya yi haka.
However, these are not known.	Duk da haka, waɗannan ba a san su ba.
But not a bad feeling.	Amma ba mummunan ji ba.
They were busy.	Sun kasance suna cikin aiki.
Let's take a look at this project.	Bari mu kalli wannan aikin.
Some work during the day and some at night.	Wasu suna aiki da rana wasu kuma da dare.
Mind told her of course.	Hankali ya gaya mata tabbas haka ne.
It seemed like nothing to him.	Ya yi kamar ba komai gare shi ba.
It is complete.	Ya cika.
Everything about it was, really.	Komai game da shi ya kasance, da gaske.
And you remember them well.	Kuma kuna tuna su da kyau.
He will come.	Zai zo.
I have never been happier in my life.	Ban yi farin ciki a rayuwa ta ba.
And bring me back.	Kuma ka dawo da ni.
The food was delicious and tasty.	Abincin ya zama mai dadi da dadi.
They really do.	Da gaske suke yi.
I kept the rest to myself.	Na ajiye sauran a kaina.
Some suggest renaming.	Wasu suna ba da shawarar sake suna.
I know what the problem is.	Na san menene matsalar.
This article is unacceptable.	Wannan labarin ba abin yarda ba ne.
You give it to everyone in it.	Kai na ba kowa a ciki.
It is always on time.	Kullum yana kan lokaci.
Maybe there is, of course.	Wataƙila akwai, ba shakka.
I will never really get it.	Ba zan taɓa samun gaske ba.
There is a seat there.	Akwai wurin zama a can.
It was close and not a difficult journey.	Ya kasance kusa kuma ba tafiya mai wahala ba.
We went, but we did not go.	Mun tafi, amma ba mu tafi ba.
I can not do anything.	Ba zan iya yin wani abu ba.
Watch my movie.	Kalli fim na.
Do it every day.	Yi shi kowace rana.
We work together, but we also play together.	Muna aiki tare, amma kuma muna wasa tare.
I have to keep talking.	Dole na ci gaba da magana.
Is this a game?	Wannan wasa ne?
It was done well.	An yi shi da kyau.
And this is something.	Kuma wannan wani abu ne.
She loves to swim.	Tana son yin iyo.
In the end, she did.	A ƙarshe, ta yi.
She was beautiful and slept most of the time.	Ta yi kyau kuma ta yi barci mafi yawan lokaci.
Does that sound familiar?	Shin hakan yana jin saba?.
Stay safe, everyone !.	A zauna lafiya, kowa da kowa!.
That may or may not happen.	Hakan na iya faruwa ko a'a.
She also never used it.	Ita ma bata taba amfani da ita ba.
Start somewhere else.	Fara a wani wuri kuma.
So we made it a game.	Don haka muka mai da shi wasa.
Like in, one.	Kamar a cikin, daya.
That's what he wants to be called.	Abin da yake son a kira shi ke nan.
What kids do.	Abin da yara ke yi.
And the best.	Kuma mafi kyau.
You will be very happy.	Za ku ji daɗi sosai.
She looks sad but cries.	Kallon bakin ciki take amma tana kuka.
Call us now.	Kira mu yanzu.
I learned a lot.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa.
And we did nothing.	Kuma ba mu yi komai ba.
Now we pay for that.	Yanzu mun biya wannan.
He keeps telling you.	Ya ci gaba da gaya muku.
I should not touch it.	Kada in taba ta.
No, don't worry about us.	A'a, kada ku damu da mu.
I hope they enjoy it there.	Ina fatan za su ji daɗi a can.
Or even higher.	Ko ma mafi girma.
If she can't help it, she drinks.	Idan ta kasa taimaka, sai ta sha.
We started with that.	Mun fara da cewa.
Thoughts are not life-sustaining.	Tunani ba mai ɗaukar rayuwa ba ne.
This house is beautiful.	Wannan gidan yana da kyau.
It feels like something real.	Yana jin kamar wani abu na gaskiya.
The task was difficult at first.	Aikin yana da wahala da farko.
But someone else did.	Amma wani ne suka gane.
No response expected.	Ba a yi tsammanin amsa ba.
A wonderful world sometimes.	Duniya mai ban mamaki wani lokacin.

One two, one two.	Daya biyu, daya biyu.
First, you will see who they hit.	Na farko, za ku ga wanda suka buga.
She knew she could fight.	Ta san za ta iya fada.
It is common.	Yana da na kowa.
It should continue to do.	Ya kamata a ci gaba da yin.
He drank once a day for a month.	Ya sha sau daya a rana tsawon wata daya.
Nothing good.	Babu wani abu mai kyau.
And, what else.	Kuma, me kuma.
He was like any other driver to me.	Ya zama kamar kowane mai tuƙi a gare ni.
Now they are being watched.	Yanzu ana kallon su.
And no one came out looking really good.	Kuma babu wanda ya fito yayi kyau sosai.
She knows everything.	Ta san komai.
I'll be back to check on you.	Zan dawo in duba ku.
We will join them.	Za mu shiga su.
And we feel every child needs to feel successful.	Kuma muna jin kowane yaro yana buƙatar jin nasara.
It would be recommended not to use this.	Zai ba da shawarar kar a yi amfani da wannan.
Surprisingly so the car was.	Abin mamaki haka motar ta kasance.
We are not joking.	Ba wasa muke ba.
It must have been amazing.	Dole ne ya zama mai ban mamaki.
Not every game.	Ba kowane wasa ba.
They will be bigger.	Za su fi girma.
Third, there are other things in the game.	Na uku, akwai wasu abubuwa a cikin wasa.
I'd rather go back to work.	Gara in koma bakin aiki.
Whatever they do, they do day and night.	Duk abin da suke yi, dare da rana suke yi.
Maybe we still get there.	Wataƙila har yanzu mu isa can.
This lunch is amazing !.	Wannan abincin rana yana da ban mamaki!.
Need to work with it.	Bukatar aiki da shi.
It's time.	Lokaci ne.
She did not see.	Ba ta gani ba.
You are using this.	Kuna amfani da wannan.
They were in the future altogether.	Sun kasance a nan gaba daya.
It comes often.	Ya zo sau da yawa.
But also because of that.	Amma kuma saboda haka.
Let them go back to school.	Su koma makaranta.
Maybe he's waiting for someone else.	Wataƙila yana jiran wani.
There is nothing he can use.	Babu wani abu da zai iya amfani da shi.
And watching a lot of movies.	Kuma kallon fim da yawa.
End of course.	Karshen hanya.
Kids stop this!	Yara ku daina wannan!
I need to check it out, but not you.	Ina bukata in duba shi, amma ba ku.
I can tell you this, though.	Zan iya gaya muku wannan, ko da yake.
I can't think of anything to say to him.	Ba zan iya tunanin abin da zan ce masa ba.
In fact, you have to work for nothing.	A gaskiya, dole ne ku yi aiki ba don komai ba.
We understand this desire.	Mun fahimci wannan sha'awar.
He died.	Ya mutu.
It feels great.	Ya ji sosai.
She does not want to be late.	Ba ta so ta makara.
We have all heard of this man.	Mu duka mun ji wannan mutumin.
We never knew the man's name.	Ba mu taɓa sanin sunan mutumin ba.
They will not agree.	Ba za su yarda ba.
The man was immediately arrested by police.	Nan take ‘yan sanda suka kama mutumin.
My head hurts.	Kaina yayi zafi.
Now you have three children.	Yanzu kana da yara uku.
Everyone was close and still.	Duk ya kasance kusa kuma har yanzu.
Talk about why they do what they do.	Magana game da dalilin da ya sa suke yin abin da suke yi.
He knows when it is good.	Ya san lokacin da yake da kyau.
Watch it, play it.	Kallon shi, wasa da shi.
It's cold.	Ya yi sanyi.
Please do not read this book.	Don Allah kar a karanta wannan littafin.
Nothing was ever done.	Ba a taɓa yin komai ba.
The meeting was very nice.	Taron ya yi kyau sosai.
It was completely rejected.	An yi gaba ɗaya ƙi.
It doesn't matter, she said quickly.	Ba komai, ta ce da sauri.
I want to see what else you got there.	Ina so in ga me kuma kuka samu a can.
Yes, the world is moving forward, moving forward.	Haka ne, duniya tana ci gaba, gaba da gaba.
She is very beautiful.	Tana da kyau sosai.
People are not always the same as they used to be.	Mutane ba koyaushe suke kamar yadda suke ba.
People too	Mutane ma
We usually agree.	Mun saba yarda.
There is no place for you here.	Babu wuri a gare ku a nan.
Not too hot, not too cold.	Ba zafi sosai, ba sanyi ba.
It feels good.	Ya ji dadi.
Still not ready to go out.	Har yanzu bata shirya fita ba.
It is something we say every day.	Abu ne da muke fada kowace rana.
I told him I asked him so.	Na gaya masa na tambaye shi haka.
There is more to this article here.	Akwai ƙarin ga wannan labarin a nan.
I will bring it.	Zan kawo shi.
Work is necessary.	Aiki ya zama dole.
And it will always look like it hasn’t been fixed.	Kuma ko da yaushe za a ga kamar ba a gyara ba.
We will bring in more people as we need them.	Za mu kawo ƙarin mutane kamar yadda muke buƙatar su.
There is no doubt about it.	Babu shakka game da shi.
Then the third.	Sai na uku.
If they like it, great.	Idan suna son shi, mai girma.
They and everyone else on board.	Su da duk wanda ke cikin wannan jirgin.
She would continue, injured perhaps, but not severely injured.	Za ta ci gaba, ta yi rauni watakila, amma ba ta samu rauni sosai ba.
He always made her feel bad.	Kullum sai ya bata mata dadi.
I did not know you were out.	Ban san kun fita ba.
But then, for him, maybe he did.	Amma sai, a gare shi, watakila ya yi.
This does not work.	Wannan ba ya aiki.
They want to be talked to.	Suna so a yi magana da su.
I'm sure I didn't.	Na tabbata ban yi ba.
I do not have any equipment.	Ba ni da wani kayan aiki.
Yesterday was a good one, although she was tired.	Jiya ta kasance mai kyau, ko da yake ta gaji.
Some will make you laugh, some will make you cry.	Wasu za su sa ka dariya, wasu za su sa ka kuka.
I hated it, how.	Da na ƙi, ta yaya.
No one can see it.	Ba wanda kowa zai iya gani.
Wrong, of course.	Ba daidai ba, ba shakka.
It's too cold.	Yayi sanyi sosai.
I think this time is good.	Ina ganin wannan lokacin yana da kyau.
Let's start slowly.	Mu fara da hankali.
He spoke because he wanted to.	Ya yi magana saboda yana so.
We do not know when he was there.	Ba mu san lokacin da ya kasance a wurin ba.
I will be glad to see you.	Zan yi farin cikin ganin ku.
Maybe she died.	Wataƙila ta mutu.
I got it completely.	Na samu gaba daya.
I like the first one.	Ina son na farko.
This should not be left out.	Bai kamata a bar wannan ba.
I hope you will stay longer.	Ina fatan za ku tsaya sau da yawa.
Nor will they.	Haka kuma ba za su yi ba.
He did not expect that.	Bai yi tsammanin haka ba.
I have always wanted fear.	A koyaushe ina son tsoro.
He got three years on his own.	Ya samu shekaru uku a kansa.
A lot of interesting things happened.	Abubuwa masu ban sha'awa da yawa sun faru.
Maybe he just wants to use them.	Wataƙila yana son amfani da su kawai.
They have nothing to say.	Ba su da abin cewa.
You didn't reach out.	Bata kai hannu ba.
But that made me feel good.	Amma abin ya sa na ji dadi.
I get that sometimes.	Ina samun haka wani lokaci.
We fit in.	Mun dace a ciki.
You can hear it.	Kuna iya jin shi.
In fact he was right.	A gaskiya ya yi daidai.
However, many were left behind.	Duk da haka, an bar mutane da yawa.
But it was good.	Amma ya yi kyau.
He fights it.	Yana fada da shi.
She felt unsure of what to do.	Ta ji rashin tabbas me zata yi.
Go back please.	Ku koma baya don Allah.
Probably for everyone who is with him.	Wataƙila ga duk wanda yake tare da shi.
The man is running over the weekend here.	Mutumin yana gudu a karshen mako a nan.
We are working on a project.	Muna aiki akan wani aiki.
You are home now boy.	Kana gida yanzu yaro.
I do not answer him.	Ba na amsa masa.
Maybe nothing.	Wataƙila ba komai.
Feel how it feels like you.	Ji yadda yake ji kamar ku.
He laughed.	Da yayi dariya.
They passed it one by one.	Suka wuce shi daya bayan daya.
And a little for myself too.	Kuma kadan ga kaina ma.
More than enough.	Fiye da isa.
That is the only reason to do so.	Wannan shine kawai dalilin yin hakan.
It's right there.	Yana nan daidai.
I got into them a lot.	Na shiga cikin su da yawa.
He is really watching us.	Kallon mu yake yi da gaske.
I understand why they did it though.	Na fahimci dalilin da ya sa suka yi shi ko da yake.
Is that so.	Haka ne.
No one is sure.	Babu wanda ya tabbata.
Go home.	Tafi gida.
I did not get up.	Ban tashi ba.
You wonder how this program misses the game.	Kuna mamakin yadda wannan shirin yake rasa wasa.
You will not see any fear in me.	Ba za ku ga wani tsoro a kaina ba.
They are used to it.	Wasa ne suka saba.
You made a mistake.	Ka yi kuskure.
One year.	Shekara guda daya.
Anyone can take them.	Kowa zai iya ɗaukar su.
I do not know.	Ban san haka ba.
But this is what happened.	Amma abin da ya faru ke nan.
Write for health.	Rubuta don lafiya.
Things never worked out.	Abubuwa ba su taɓa yin aiki ba.
She is beautiful.	Ta yi kyau.
I love her here right now.	Ina son ta a nan a yanzu.
We hope you enjoy it !.	Muna fatan za ku ji daɗi!.
They said to stay there.	Suka ce su zauna a wurin.
It will not be easy.	Ba zai zama da sauƙi ba.
I was happy to do that.	Na yi farin ciki da yin hakan.
It is good to see you.	Yana da kyau ganin ku.
She does not need that.	Ba ta bukatar hakan.
Sorry I left you with this.	Yi hakuri na bar ku da wannan.
It's not much.	Ba shi da yawa.
I don’t know how it all works.	Ban san yadda duk yake aiki ba.
It is, well, do not worry.	Yana da, da kyau, kada ku damu.
So you just sleep.	Don haka kawai kuna barci.
It is the same now.	Haka yake a yanzu.
Today, they do not.	A yau, ba su yi ba.
That's what the kids did.	Abin da yara suka yi ke nan.
That's his favorite.	Haka ya fi so.
In each car there is a policeman.	A kowace mota akwai dan sanda.
He was in a hurry.	Ya yi sauri.
Something, really.	Wani abu, da gaske.
I found this interesting.	Na sami wannan abin ban sha'awa.
They have to wait.	Dole ne su jira.
Go safely.	A tafi lafiya.
Do not stop there.	Kar ka tsaya a can.
The car went somewhere else.	Motar ta shiga wani waje.
They will not be happy.	Ba za su yi farin ciki ba.
You just died.	Ka mutu haka kawai.
I want him to come here.	Ina so ya zo nan.
Learn everything about it and work through your game.	Koyi komai game da shi kuma yi aiki a cikin wasan ku.
One month at most.	Wata daya a mafi yawa.
That will change.	Wannan zai canza.
I will come on time, he said.	Zan zo a kan lokaci, in ji shi.
No need.	Babu bukata.
Or maybe this one.	Ko watakila wannan.
Not for you, but for you.	Ba a gare ku ba, amma a gare ku.
This is happening fast.	Wannan yana faruwa da sauri.
But this is not true.	Amma wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
She also does not want anyone.	Ita kuma bata son wani.
Seeing as how you do not know what they are.	Ganin yadda ba ku san menene su ba.
I said that again.	Na sake cewa.
I decided that no.	Na yanke shawarar cewa a'a.
We have a problem.	Muna da matsala.
Same with drinks.	Daidai da abubuwan sha.
He died before she could answer.	Ya mutu kafin ta amsa.
I always feel like something or someone is with me.	Kullum ina jin kamar wani abu ko wani yana tare da ni.
It's so big.	Yana da girma sosai.
I speak for myself.	Ina magana da kaina.
Maybe you can think of some more.	Wataƙila za ku iya yin tunanin wasu ƙarin.
Not surprisingly, and nothing new about that.	Ba abin mamaki bane, kuma babu wani sabon abu game da hakan.
There is no way.	Babu wata hanya.
Then everyone has something to eat.	Bayan haka kowa ya sami abin da zai ci.
I can help you.	Zan iya taimaka muku.
Eat them or save them.	Ku ci su ko ajiye su.
After he passed she moved to another.	Bayan ya wuce sai ta koma wani.
I can see that in you.	Ina iya ganin hakan a cikin ku.
Playing to try something.	Da yake wasa don gwada wani abu.
He is a man who gets it.	Mutum ne mai samun shi.
Now do it.	Yanzu yi.
He will not return to the game.	Ba zai koma wasan ba.
It was late at night.	Sai dare yayi.
No one really knows.	Babu wanda ya sani da gaske.
He appears to be the first of many.	Ya bayyana shi ne na farko da yawa.
We've done it before.	Mun yi shi a baya.
I was not around that.	Ban kasance a kusa da hakan ba.
This is definitely a difficult thing to do.	Wannan tabbas abu ne mai wahala.
In fact, let’s really start.	A gaskiya, bari mu fara da gaske.
Where have you been?	Ina ka je?
It's not fun.	Ba abin farin ciki ba.
We have a job.	Muna da aikin yi.
I'm leaving now.	Zan tafi yanzu.
They are reformers, only reformers.	Su masu kawo gyara ne, masu kawo gyara ne kawai.
It will be a difficult task.	Zai zama aiki mai wahala.
I too was caught inside.	Ni ma an kama ni a ciki.
Absolutely.	Babu shakka.
But this is not the case.	Amma wannan ba haka ba ne.
We have supplies.	Muna da kayan.
It should not be so.	Bai kamata ya zama haka ba.
We know it will be difficult for some people to do.	Mun san zai yi wuya wasu mutane su yi.
It is one thing they do not want to happen.	Abu daya ne ba sa so ya faru.
Only in this way can they do so.	Ta haka ne kawai za su iya yin hakan.
She can eat anything from scratch.	Zata iya cin abinci daga komai ba komai.
No, of course not.	A'a, tabbas a'a.
It was like a.	Ya kasance kamar a.
Just play something.	Yi wasa wani abu kawai.
I prepared myself correctly.	Na shirya kaina daidai.
He could not say anything.	Ya kasa cewa komai.
The coffee is hot.	Kofi yayi zafi.
I didn’t stop to think.	Ban tsaya tunani ba.
You know it doesn't work that way.	Ka san ba ya aiki haka.
His name has not been disclosed.	Ba a bayyana sunan sa ba.
It's too cold.	Yayi sanyi sosai.
We must finish this.	Dole ne mu gama wannan.
The car is full.	Motar ta cika.
It will continue into next week.	Za a ci gaba zuwa mako mai zuwa.
This is as close to it as you get it.	Wannan ya kusan zuwa gare shi kamar yadda kuka samu.
Yet we do so without a doubt.	Duk da haka muna yin haka ba tare da wata shakka ba.
Now he is trying to go faster and fix things.	Yanzu yana ƙoƙarin tafiya da sauri da gyara abubuwa.
I haven't read it yet.	Ban karanta shi ba tukuna.
But he did not think it would.	Amma bai yi tunanin zai yi ba.
Of course not at all.	Tabbas ba komai bane gaba daya.
A few are already married and gone.	Wasu 'yan sun riga sun yi aure sun tafi.
Go for a run.	Ku tafi gudu.
But this, they know, is necessary.	Amma wannan, sun sani, ya zama dole.
What he said is true.	Abin da ya fada gaskiya ne.
It is not as simple as it looks.	Ba shi da sauƙi kamar yadda yake gani.
But he did not stop there.	Amma bai tsaya nan ba.
But you did not.	Amma ba ku yi ba.
He wanted to be with her.	Ya so ya kasance da ita.
We like these.	Muna son waɗannan.
It gave me a cold.	Ya ba ni sanyi.
No one understood anything that went on.	Babu wanda ya fahimci wani abu da ya ci gaba.
I wouldn’t call it right.	Ba zan kira shi daidai ba.
It will never be recognized.	Ba za a taɓa gane shi ba.
The booklet is still too much.	Har yanzu ɗan littafin ya yi yawa.
Looks like rain.	Gani kamar ruwan sama.
If they really love you they will come back.	Idan suna son ku da gaske za su dawo.
I put my hand next to her.	Na sa hannu na kusa da ita.
And it's just dinner.	Kuma abincin dare ne kawai.
And we did.	Kuma mun yi haka.
Even after all this time.	Ko bayan duk wannan lokacin.
You have no money.	Ba ku da kuɗi.
It's not a children's room.	Ba dakin yara bane.
However it does not work.	Duk da haka ba ya aiki.
And there it was true.	Kuma a can ya kasance gaskiya.
We were given the job.	An yi mana aikin.
She will do the same now.	Haka za ta yi yanzu.
Someone to take who you are.	Wani don ɗaukar wanda kuka kasance.
That made him happy even though he was not.	Hakan ya sa shi farin ciki ko da ba ya.
One thing.	Wani abu daya.
All you have to do is run.	Babu abin yi sai gudu.
He helped me all he could.	Ya taimake ni duk abin da zai iya.
This is a very nice place.	Wannan wuri ne mai kyau sosai.
It will be sick for all of us.	Zai zama rashin lafiya a gare mu duka.
How much is too good.	Nawa yayi kyau sosai.
But little is known about them.	Amma ba a san da yawa game da su ba.
But you do not know.	Amma ba ku sani ba.
Otherwise it is very good.	In ba haka ba yana da kyau sosai.
So far they have not found.	Ya zuwa yanzu ba su samu ba.
The method may be erroneous.	Hanyar na iya yin kuskure.
That's exactly right.	Wannan daidai yake daidai.
One can hear.	Mutum zai iya ji.
There is nothing to set aside time.	Babu wani abu don sanya lokaci.
This is not the same.	Wannan ba ɗaya ba ne.
Now, how.	A yanzu, ta yaya.
Maybe you should go with him?	Wataƙila ya kamata ku tafi tare da shi?
I passed them.	Na wuce su.
No, they will not accept this!	A'a, ba za su yarda da wannan ba!
Many people came to the festival.	Mutane da yawa sun zo bikin.
People are not working.	Mutane ba su da aiki.
Sometimes it does, and sometimes it doesn't.	Wani lokaci yana yi, wani lokacin kuma ba ya yi.
The place is very close.	Wurin ya kusa kusa.
She was immediately injured.	Nan take ta ji rauni.
Certainly not.	Lallai ba lallai bane.
I want to stick to that one song.	Ina so in tsaya a kan wannan waƙa ɗaya.
But it may be otherwise.	Amma yana iya zama in ba haka ba.
But there is a problem with that.	Amma akwai matsala game da hakan.
Don't worry at all.	Kada ku damu ko kadan.
This is a surprise.	Wannan abin mamaki ne.
I feel sleepy.	Ina jin barci.
They have to work together.	Dole ne su yi aiki tare.
It would be good to remember that.	Zai yi kyau ta tuna da hakan.
They have very little.	Kadan ne suke da shi.
He looks up.	Yana kallon sama.
But we must give it a chance.	Amma dole ne mu ba shi dama.
Some are working there.	Wasu ne ke aiki a wurin.
Not how it looks.	Ba yadda yake kama ba.
Or he may finally find out something about himself.	Ko kuma a ƙarshe ya fahimci wani abu game da kansa.
This is what it looks like.	Wannan shi ne abin da yake kama.
A child can fall.	Yaro zai iya fada.
I think she can do whatever she wants.	Ina jin za ta iya yin duk abin da take so.
I want to conquer the world.	Ina so in yi nasara a kan duniya.
Do not use in children under two years of age.	Kada a yi amfani da yara masu kasa da biyu.
We will stay here tonight.	Za mu tsaya a nan a daren yau.
Just tell me something about yourself.	Kawai sai ka gaya mani wani abu game da kai.
Right like rain.	Dama kamar ruwan sama.
You must live with us, be one with us, or die.	Dole ne ku zauna tare da mu, ku zama ɗaya tare da mu, ko ku mutu.
I use this for my own benefit.	Na yi amfani da wannan don amfani na.
Another train passed by.	Wani jirgin kasa ya wuce sama.
You should not get tired.	Bai kamata ku gaji ba.
If no one looked, no one bought.	Idan babu wanda ya duba, babu wanda ya saya.
You thought they couldn’t find you.	Kun yi tsammanin ba za su iya samun ku ba.
I think you should know.	Na ga ya kamata ku sani.
They were close now, they almost ran out.	Sun kasance kusa yanzu, sun kusa gudu daga.
The method works the following way.	Hanyar tana aiki ta hanya mai zuwa.
Someone can fill them in there.	Wani zai iya cika su a ciki.
Start on time and prepare everything.	Fara akan lokaci kuma shirya komai.
I can't take it.	Ba zan iya ɗauka ba.
I put a little bit of everything here.	Na sanya kadan daga cikin komai a nan.
I don't really agree.	Ban yarda sosai ba.
And he was.	Kuma ya kasance.
So, it will be very cold.	Don haka, zai yi sanyi sosai.
Maybe others will.	Wataƙila wasu za su yi.
The house is very big.	Gidan yana da girma sosai.
Now it's gone and the rest of us have a chance.	Yanzu ya tafi an 'sauran mu muna da dama.
She reached the ground	Ta kai kasa
He put the goods away and returned home.	Ya ajiye kayan ya koma gida.
Probably no one ever called in any way.	Wataƙila babu wanda ya taɓa kira ta wata hanya.
The car is useless.	Motar ba ta da amfani.
And we do not want you to wait cold.	Kuma ba ma so ku yi sanyi jira.
Look	Kalli
And we did it, we removed it.	Kuma mun yi shi, mun cire shi.
But there are no people.	Amma babu mutane.
When we flew to him.	Lokacin da muka tashi zuwa gare shi.
My look is in the room.	Kallon nawa yayi a dakin.
I didn’t expect him to get anything, but he looked pretty sure.	Ban yi tsammanin zai sami wani abu ba, amma ya yi kama da tabbas.
For years I did not think about it.	Na yi shekaru ban yi tunani game da shi ba.
And sometimes they are just interested.	Kuma wani lokacin suna sha'awar kawai.
Can you imagine how this works?	Za ku iya tunanin yadda wannan ke aiki?
The children are sleeping well.	Yara suna barci lafiya.
We will continue to do this.	Za mu ci gaba da yin wannan.
We are just waiting.	Muna jira kawai.
There he stayed.	Nan ya zauna.
We agreed that we were right.	Mun yarda cewa mun kasance daidai.
I have never seen him.	Ban taba ganin sa ba.
I will look at you carefully.	Zan duba ku a hankali.
I should have died.	Ya kamata in mutu.
I love how this started.	Ina son yadda wannan ya fara.
This is not a mistake.	Wannan ba kuskure ba ne.
I will start it soon.	Zan fara shi nan da nan.
More than today for a while now.	Fiye da yau na ɗan lokaci yanzu.
They help us all.	Suna taimakon mu duka.
I want to do something great.	Ina so in yi wani babban abu.
He is not crying.	Ba kuka yake yi ba.
All of this costs a lot of money.	Duk wannan yana kashe kuɗi da yawa.
This is a big mistake.	Wannan babban kuskure ne.
So they sat down.	Haka suka zauna.
Of course I will check this out a little more.	Tabbas zan kara duba wannan kadan.
Look? 	Duba?
I hope you can see that.	Ina fatan za ku iya ganin hakan.
And that is what happened.	Kuma abin da ya faru ke nan.
Although he did not.	Ko da yake bai yi ba.
The food was delicious.	Abinci mai dadi ya yi dadi.
Just in.	Kawai a.
There will never be time.	Ba za a taɓa samun lokaci ba.
Tom is looking for a new job.	Tom yana neman sabon aiki.
Tell me what happened.	Fada min me ya faru.
I can't take her home.	Ba zan iya kai ta gida ba.
It became a real job.	Ya zama aiki na gaske.
How are you.	Yaya ku.
You take care of yourself.	Kuna kula da ku.
I wrote, but this was difficult for me.	Na rubuta, amma wannan yana da wuya a gare ni.
This is what happened.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya faru.
Now he lives alone.	Yanzu yana zaune shi kadai.
He did not speak to anyone.	Bai yi magana da kowa ba.
I know where he lives.	Na san inda ya zauna.
The man stopped quickly.	Mutumin ya tsaya da sauri.
No food, no water.	Babu abinci, babu ruwa.
They have not heard.	Ba su ji labarin ba.
Interesting, but not very progressive.	Abin ban sha'awa, amma ba ci gaba sosai ba.
We played well.	Mun buga da kyau.
That made me very happy.	Hakan ya sa na ji daɗi sosai.
I do not have these.	Ba ni da waɗannan.
Still get what you need.	Har yanzu sami abin da ake bukata.
But the story has some surprises.	Amma labarin yana da abubuwa masu ban mamaki.
No more talking.	Babu sauran magana.
I don’t see why it should continue.	Ban ga dalilin da ya sa za ta ci gaba ba.
That is a fact.	Hakan ya tabbata.
But it doesn't have to be this way.	Amma bai kamata ya zama haka ba.
It’s still a good game.	Har yanzu kyakkyawan wasa ne.
I finished everything.	Na gama komai.
But nothing.	Amma ba komai.
Good to know.	Da kyau a sani.
I don’t really understand the upcoming project.	Ban fahimci aikin mai zuwa ba sosai.
Try the tool.	Gwada gwada kayan aikin.
I want to get you here.	Ina son samun ku a nan.
Prepare the filling first.	Shirya cika da farko.
It's scary.	Tsoro ne.
Tested several times.	An gwada sau da yawa.
May know him.	Iya san shi.
Coffee is my favorite drink, it seems.	Kofi shine abin sha da aka fi so, da alama.
Not saying anything.	Ba cewa komai ba.
Just for you.	Don ku kawai.
She has no resemblance.	Ba ta da kama.
I need them to give it to her.	Ina bukata su ba ta.
I really like it.	Ina matukar son shi sosai.
She did not return home after the game.	Bata dawo gida ba bayan wasan.
These are the ones who do it.	Waɗannan su ne suke yin sa.
They worked hard, until they stopped working.	Sun yi aiki sosai, har sai da suka daina aiki.
It rained heavily at night.	An yi ruwan sama sosai a cikin dare.
And yet it is necessary.	Kuma duk da haka dole.
It really failed.	Da gaske ya kasa.
It’s just not accustomed to heat.	Kawai ba a saba da zafi ba.
It is not an easy task.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
I will not die.	Ba zan mutu ba.
This is a difficult year for many.	Wannan shekara ce mai wahala ga mutane da yawa.
It would be nice.	Zai yi kyau.
Maybe that's why they passed.	Watakila shi ya sa suka wuce.
I wouldn’t be surprised if he leaves you here.	Ba zan yi mamaki ba idan ya bar ku a nan.
I'm tired of eating.	Na gaji da cin abinci.
And this is also surprising.	Kuma wannan ma abin mamaki ne.
But that is not what happened.	Amma ba haka ya faru ba.
When I do that it doesn’t work, nothing happens.	Lokacin da na yi haka ba ya aiki, babu abin da ke faruwa.
He spoke to the police.	Yayi magana da 'yan sanda.
She could say a lot.	Ta iya cewa da yawa.
This last one was the reason he left in the morning.	Wannan na ƙarshe shine abin da ya sa ya tafi da safe.
It is difficult for you to concentrate.	Yana da wuya a gare ku ku mai da hankali.
She said.	Ta fad'a.
I need to work on that.	Ina bukata in yi aiki a kan hakan.
You need.	Kuna bukata.
I want him to explain it.	Ina so in ji ya bayyana shi.
With you inside.	Tare da ku a ciki.
I didn’t think of anything at first.	Ban yi tunanin komai ba da farko.
She had no idea what she was thinking.	Bata san me take tunani ba.
I wonder he didn’t come out to be bigger.	Ina mamakin bai fito ya zama mafi girma ba.
He fell into the room.	Ya fad'a cikin d'akin.
This works most of the time.	Wannan yana aiki mafi yawan lokaci.
Only now can we know.	Yanzu ne kawai za mu iya sani.
I will tell you now.	Zan gaya muku a yanzu.
We are scared.	Mun ji tsoro.
You are scared.	Kun ji tsoro.
He did it without thinking.	Ya yi ba tare da tunani ba.
Everything feels right, yet really.	Komai yana jin daidai, duk da haka da gaske.
This will fit the previous one.	Wannan zai dace da na baya.
Give it to me.	Ya ba ni.
I arrived here on my own.	Na isa nan da kaina.
I learned how it was out there later.	Na koyi yadda abin yake a waje daga baya.
We leave when the work is done.	Muna barin idan an gama aikin.
Not necessarily.	Ba lallai ba ne.
It has to be.	Dole ne ya kasance.
I know they talked.	Na san sun yi magana.
This is us.	Mu kenan.
The room was full of people.	Dakin ya cika da mutane.
Attempts eventually paid off.	Ƙoƙari a ƙarshe ya biya.
Somehow they are fun and exciting to work with.	Ko ta yaya suna da ban sha'awa da ban sha'awa na aiki.
You can't win with me.	Ba za ku iya samun nasara da ni ba.
We were tired when we got there.	Mun gaji a lokacin da muka isa wurin.
They can be used only once.	Ana iya amfani da su sau ɗaya kawai.
He laughed so hard.	Yayi dariya sosai.
It will take another.	Zai ɗauki wani.
Not sure.	Bai tabbata ba.
Your job prospects are good.	Fatan ku na neman aikin yi yana da kyau.
Toilet.	Bayan gida.
You want something more than life.	Kuna son wani abu fiye da rayuwa.
But not about that.	Amma ba game da wannan ba.
Suppose she called him at home.	A ce ta kira shi a gida.
I would never find it so good.	Ba zan taba samun shi mai kyau haka ba.
Looking at us intently, 'he began.	Kallon mu sosai,' ya fara.
Nothing came out.	Babu wani abu da ya fito.
I'm not feeling well.	Ba ni da jin dadi.
I have to check.	Dole na duba.
He said he wanted to sleep.	Sai ya ce yana so ya yi barci.
I did not, however, rain very much.	Ban yi ba, duk da haka, ruwa sosai.
So my correction is working.	Don haka gyara na yana aiki.
You may have read about it.	Wataƙila ka karanta game da shi.
The problem is still there.	Matsalar har yanzu tana nan.
They are growing.	Suna girma.
I could not understand why he did not do so.	Na kasa gane dalilin da yasa bai yi haka ba.
I know him.	Na san shi.
In fact they stood firm.	A gaskiya ma sun tsaya sosai.
Take care of the room next to you.	Kula da dakin da ke kusa da ku.
I recommend you start doing this.	Ina ba da shawarar ku fara yin haka.
Let's get started !.	Mu fara!.
All three such items are excluded.	Ana cire irin waɗannan abubuwa guda uku.
Watching go again.	Kallon tafi kuma.
Something about the man felt familiar.	Wani abu game da mutumin ya ji saba.
It is difficult to capture success.	Da wuya a kama da nasara.
A year ago, she got there.	Shekara daya da ta wuce, ta isa can.
Doing it is harder than just walking.	Yi ya fi wuya a yi tafiya kawai.
I called him over.	Na kira shi a kai.
And the world is not the best place for her.	Kuma duniya ba wuri mafi kyau gare ta ba.
They did not kill the world.	Ba su kashe duniya ba.
Now is the time to speak.	Yanzu ne lokacin magana.
I want to do something that will not do that.	Ina so in yi abin da ba zai yi hakan ba.
Now, we show as below.	Yanzu, mun nuna kamar yadda a kasa.
Yet it certainly could not be written.	Amma duk da haka tabbas ba za a iya rubuta shi ba.
We can all go on like this.	Duk muna iya ci gaba da ci gaba kamar haka.
That is why people do not use it.	Shi ya sa mutane ba sa amfani da shi.
Let's do that.	Mu yi haka.
This is common.	Wannan na kowa ne.
That is life.	Rayuwa kenan.
I have no problem with it.	Ba ni da wata matsala da shi.
He was given ample opportunity to defend himself.	An ba shi dama mai yawa don ya kare kansa.
And mine.	Kuma nawa.
If you know where to look.	Idan kun san inda za ku duba.
Kids do what they want.	Yara suna yin abin da suke so.
They filled the nursery.	Sun cika gidan yara.
And we love them.	Kuma muna son su.
He opened it with coffee in his hand.	Ya bude da kofi a hannu.
When does the opening ceremony begin?	Yaushe za a fara bikin bude taron?
It is good to see you.	Yana da kyau ganin ku.
One thing really.	Abu daya da gaske.
Try to find it.	Yi ƙoƙarin gano shi.
He did, though.	Ya yi, ko da yake.
You should know something.	Ya kamata ku san wani abu.
Maybe you can explain it.	Wataƙila za ku iya bayyana shi.
You can do it from home.	Kuna iya yin shi daga gida.
I can't tell anyone.	Ba zan iya gaya wa kowa ba.
Not close to do.	Ba kusa ba zai yi.
Just leave everything and love each other.	Kawai ku bar komai ku so juna.
He thought so.	Ya yi tsammanin haka.
No, really, you read that right.	A'a, da gaske, kun karanta daidai.
This is where he gets into trouble.	A nan ne yake samun matsala.
And the story itself is universal.	Kuma shi kansa wannan labarin na duniya ne.
Things will never happen to us.	Abubuwa ba za su taɓa yi mana ba.
Now, you have the answer.	Yanzu, kuna da amsa ta.
You have to win more than you lose.	Dole ne ku ci nasara fiye da yadda kuka yi rashin nasara.
I was on my own.	Na kasance da kaina.
I trust her because she is honest.	Na yarda da ita saboda ta yi gaskiya.
A lot has happened and there is still a lot going on.	Abubuwa da yawa sun faru kuma har yanzu abubuwa da yawa suna nan.
Everything feels good.	Komai ya ji dadi.
I hope this is not a mistake.	Ina fatan wannan ba kuskure ba ne.
Boy, does he do when he can.	Yaro, yana yi lokacin da zai iya.
I don't really like this.	Ba na son wannan da gaske.
I was very happy at home.	Na yi farin ciki sosai a gida.
She gives me time to catch her.	Tana ba ni lokaci in kama ta.
For there is something.	Don akwai wani abu.
But they are all here.	Amma su duka suna nan.
It works all the time.	Yana aiki kowane lokaci.
Use your money for food and events.	Yi amfani da kuɗin ku don abinci da abubuwan da suka faru.
But it’s a good thing, honestly.	Amma abu ne mai kyau, gaskiya.
I remember you asking me to bring this back.	Na tuna da ka ce in dawo da wannan.
Here are some.	Ga wasu.
And this is a big surprise.	Kuma wannan shi ne wannan babban abin mamaki.
But this will never happen.	Amma wannan ba zai taba faruwa ba.
Lots of things.	Abubuwa da yawa.
He began to lose his self-confidence.	Ya fara rasa yarda da kansa.
They go right out after a meal.	Suna fita daidai bayan cin abinci.
I never read it.	Ban taba karanta shi ba.
They are enough.	Suna isa sosai.
I decided to kill him.	Na yanke shawarar kashe shi.
You do too much.	Kuna yin yawa da yawa.
He has to do his best.	Dole ne ya yi mafi kyau.
It would not be so difficult.	Da ba zai yi wahala haka ba.
It was cold enough.	Sanyi ya kai har ya iya.
Do it when set.	Yi shi lokacin da aka sa.
I think maybe it doesn't work very well.	Ina tsammanin watakila ba ya aiki sosai.
And he should know.	Kuma ya kamata ya sani.
But this is not very good.	Amma wannan ba shi da kyau sosai.
The man has them.	Mutumin yana da su.
Not just the beginning.	Ba kawai farko ba.
I'll check it all out.	Zan duba duka.
However, it needs to be demonstrated.	Duk da haka, yana bukatar a nuna shi.
It requires reflection.	Yana buƙatar tunani.
But she needs time to think.	Amma tana bukatar lokaci don tunani.
So prepare yourself.	Don haka shirya kanku.
I will hear it.	Zan ji shi.
It just has to be one thing.	Dole ne kawai ya zama abu ɗaya.
In the end it was easy.	A ƙarshe ya kasance mai sauƙi.
That's how they got to know each other.	Haka suka san juna.
You read.	Kun karanta.
Probably, not always.	Wataƙila, ba koyaushe ba.
For a moment he said nothing.	Cikin dan lokaci bai ce komai ba.
He is not sure if he will ever do it, not at all.	Bai tabbata ko zai taba yi ba, ba gaba daya ba.
Maybe I won’t even be a real person.	Wataƙila ma ba zan zama ainihin mutum ba.
There are always people, too helpful.	Akwai mutane ko da yaushe, masu taimako ma.
Of course he did not know.	Tabbas bai sani ba.
I know you talked to them.	Na san ka yi magana da su.
They made sure they got to the job.	Sun tabbatar sun kai ga aikin.
She will know what we need.	Za ta san abin da muke bukata.
I never did that.	Ban taba yin haka ba.
But we need to come back and finish this time.	Amma muna bukatar mu dawo mu gama wannan lokacin.
We are beyond the reach of that.	Mun wuce sha'awar samun hakan.
This is a big mistake.	Wannan babban kuskure ne.
He said he would know when he got there.	Yace idan ya isa can zai sani.
There seems to be.	Akwai alama.
It took me a while to reach them.	Sai da na ɗauki lokaci kafin na isa gare su.
I want to edit this title	Ina so in gyara wannan take
I learned a lot.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa.
He told me he didn't know.	Ya ce min bai sani ba.
I found this path difficult.	Na sami wannan hanya mai wuya.
I know you will love spending time with him.	Na san za ku so lokaci tare da shi.
No two intelligent people are the same.	Babu mutane biyu masu hankali da suke daidai.
It can not be easy.	Ba zai iya zama mai sauƙi ba.
The worst is yet to come.	Mummunan zai zo yanzu.
They are.	Haka suke.
It was an amazing trip.	Tafiya ce mai ban mamaki.
I do almost that time.	Na kan yi a kusan wannan lokacin.
It was such a movie that changed lives.	Irin fim ɗin ne ya canza rayuwa.
At the time, you could not do anything.	A lokacin, ba za ku iya yin komai ba.
I may miss one.	Zan iya rasa daya.
This is a little bit.	Wannan kadan ne.
So they know what.	Don haka sun san menene.
I can not say what?	Ba zan iya cewa me?
That has to stop.	Wannan dole ya tsaya.
We spent a month in it.	Mun yi wata guda a ciki.
First of all, it increases the number of things they want.	Da farko, yana ƙara yawan abubuwan da suke so.
This is something they will be interested in.	Wannan wani abu ne da za su yi sha'awar.
Life is hard.	Rayuwa ta yi wuya.
You were not around at the time.	Ba ka zama a kusa da nan ba a lokacin.
Let's take this a little further.	Bari mu dauki wannan kadan gaba.
I knew that whatever she said would be.	Na san cewa duk abin da ta ce zai kasance.
I got really involved.	Na shiga ciki sosai.
Drive carefully.	Tuƙi a hankali.
I am just a child.	Ni yaro ne kawai.
I don’t expect anything less than progress.	Ba na tsammanin komai kasa da ci gaba.
Or find something better to do.	Ko sami wani abu mafi kyau don yi.
But he does not do that.	Amma ba ya yin haka.
You should get it.	Ya kamata ku samu.
I hope it works for me.	Ina fata ya yi min aiki.
He has been ill for a long time.	Ya dade yana rashin lafiya.
They have no problem.	Ba su da matsala.
I never went there.	Ban taba zuwa wurin ba.
But he did not just walk together.	Amma ba kawai ya yi tafiya tare ba.
It seems to have taken you somewhere.	Da alama ya kai ku wani waje.
I will do the same for you.	Ni ma zan yi maka.
I know it looks like a simple problem.	Na san cewa yana kama da matsala mai sauƙi.
So, if not read.	Don haka, idan ba a karanta ba.
I do this really well.	Ina yin wannan abin da gaske.
We did that.	Mun yi haka.
But you must help us.	Amma dole ne ku taimake mu.
There is nothing to write about.	Babu wani abu da za a rubuta a kansa.
And sometimes, not even a second time.	Kuma wani lokacin, ba ma a karo na biyu ba.
She calls before you get here.	Ta kira kafin ka isa nan.
For wedding day accessories.	Don kayan ranar aure.
Some suggest that it can be.	Wasu suna ba da shawarar cewa za a iya.
That could not happen!	Hakan ba zai iya faruwa ba!
They would have asked her where he came from.	Da sun tambaye ta daga ina ya fito.
Wait for the police here.	Ku jira 'yan sanda a nan.
Must be paid in advance.	Dole ne a biya gaba.
Go eat, go to the movies.	Ku je ku ci abinci, ku je fim.
We must now focus on the future.	Dole ne a yanzu mu mai da hankali kan gaba.
You, too, do not need to know anything.	Kai ma, ba a buƙatar ka san komai ba.
He is still right.	Ya kasance daidai har yanzu.
Simple and people think it is not enough.	Mai sauƙi da mutane suna tunanin bai isa ba.
Or he can do it all over time.	Ko kuma yana iya yin duka akan lokaci.
This was the first car to be used.	Wannan ita ce motar farko da aka fara amfani da ita.
He grew up to keep it at home.	Ya kara girma don ya ajiye a gida.
He was a child.	Ya kasance yaro.
I don't want to know anything.	Bana son sanin komai.
But there was no help for him.	Amma babu taimako a gare shi.
In fact, we were surprised.	A gaskiya, mun yi mamaki.
We were able to try some things.	Mun sami damar gwada wasu abubuwa.
First we need a home.	Da farko muna buƙatar gida.
I kept telling myself it would happen.	Na ci gaba da fada wa kaina hakan zai faru.
They are waiting for something to happen	Suna jiran wani abu ya faru
He took me there.	Ya kai ni can.
That was right next to me.	Wannan ya kasance kusa da ni.
Other than that, he was right.	Ban da wannan, ya yi gaskiya.
I have some money saved.	Ina da wasu kuɗi da aka ajiye.
That's what you want again.	Abin da kuke so ke nan kuma.
This is our favorite place.	Wannan shine wurin da muke sha'awar.
Just do it.	Kawai yi ku.
This is a great development.	Wannan babban ci gaba ne.
Many were not surprised.	Da yawa ba su yi mamaki ba.
I told him I loved him.	Na ce masa ina son shi.
You just need something to get you going.	Kuna buƙatar wani abu kawai don sa ku tafi.
I prepared it.	Na shirya shi.
Food was delivered quickly.	An kai kayan abinci da sauri.
The second day will see more.	Rana ta biyu zai ga ƙarin.
We all love you.	Duk muna son ku.
What does he do.	Me yake yi.
We want to keep going before that.	Muna so mu ci gaba da tafiya kafin hakan.
I know this is correct.	Na san wannan daidai ne.
It will not be necessary.	Ba zai zama dole ba.
I can't walk.	Ba zan iya tafiya ba.
But no one saw us except the two of us.	Amma ba wanda ya gani sai mu biyu.
He was at home.	Ya kasance a gida.
Today, it is the same.	A yau, yana da guda ɗaya.
I have never had a problem.	Ban taba samun matsala ba.
But she failed.	Amma ta kasa.
Maybe he was left out.	Watakila an bar shi.
They used to be very happy.	Sun kasance suna jin daɗi sosai.
It's not good.	Bai yi kyau ba.
That was a good thing.	Wannan ya kasance mai kyau.
He reached the car and signed at the door thinking.	Har ya isa motar ya sa hannu a kofar yana tunani.
I don't have time to think.	Ba ni da lokacin yin tunani.
I feel like she needs more work.	Ina jin kamar tana buƙatar ƙarin aiki.
He just kind of was.	Ya kawai irin ya.
He had never seen one so close.	Bai taba ganin daya kusa ba.
Somehow you protect me.	Ko ta yaya sai ka kare ni.
I really like that he is happy.	Na yi matukar son cewa yana farin ciki.
They may not eat anyone else.	Wataƙila ba za su ci wani ba.
I give her money every day.	Ina ba ta kuɗi kowace rana.
She didn't say anything for a long time.	Ta dade ba ta ce komai ba.
I knew him at the time.	Na san shi a lokacin.
Let’s not do that here.	Kada mu yi wannan a nan.
She opened the door quickly.	Ta bude kofar da sauri.
The man's mouth stopped there.	Bakin mutum ya tsaya a wurin.
Why do they do it?	Me yasa suke yin haka?
He was careful, though.	Ya yi hankali, ko da yake.
A year ago, that wouldn’t have been the case.	Shekara daya da ta wuce, da ba zai kasance ba.
You drive carefully!	Kuna tuƙi a hankali!
It's good to hear.	Yana da kyau a ji.
He heard her cry.	Sai ya ji ta yi kuka.
Your name is not valid.	Sunan ku ba shi da kyau.
And it gets even better.	Kuma yana samun ma fi kyau.
No, she is better.	A'a, ta fi kyau.
However, this method is probably the simplest.	Duk da haka, wannan hanyar yin shi tabbas mai sauƙi ne.
Do you feel any fear.	Kuna jin wani tsoro.
She always has.	Kullum tana.
But this is nothing.	Amma wannan ba komai ba ne.
Only one stood.	Daya ne kawai ya tsaya.
However, this approach is not ideal.	Duk da haka, wannan hanyar ba ta da kyau.
Or like a fish.	Ko kamar kifi.
You look sad!	Ka yi kama da bakin ciki!
He did not stop there.	Bai tsaya nan ba.
If the girls have them, she takes them.	Idan 'yan mata suna da su, sai ta kai su.
God help him.	Allah ya taimake shi.
This guy gave me a job.	Wannan mutumin ya ba ni aiki.
Only real people.	Mutane ne kawai na gaske.
He could not write anything.	Ya kasa rubuta komai.
He got up and was going to leave.	Ya tashi zai tafi.
I'm fine with that.	Ina lafiya da wannan.
It's kind of funny.	Yana da irin ban dariya.
They will do if they can.	Za su yi idan za su iya.
He does not care about such material.	Ba ya damu da irin wannan kayan.
There is no time like now.	Babu lokaci kamar yanzu.
You have too much.	Kun yi yawa.
It's just right.	Daidai ne kawai.
We need to look at it.	Muna bukatar mu duba shi.
I can't do anything.	Ba zan iya yin komai ba.
Almost immediately, she added again.	Kusan nan take, ta sake kara.
But nothing is right.	Amma babu abin da ya dace daidai.
I don’t have that much time.	Ba ni da wannan lokaci mai yawa.
I tried to protect them.	Na yi ƙoƙarin kare su.
No, it's not safe.	A'a, ba lafiya.
Some people prefer to be alone.	Wasu mutane sun fi son zama su kaɗai.
And this continues to grow every year.	Kuma wannan yana ci gaba da girma kowace shekara.
Later, he learned to love them.	Daga baya, ya koyi son su.
It must be waited until after the operation.	Dole ne a jira har sai bayan aikin.
He will not return until the weekend.	Ba zai dawo ba sai karshen mako.
I want to be out of the game.	Ina so in kasance a waje da wasa.
I will not ask anyone to give up.	Ba zan nemi kowa ya bari ba.
Let's try this.	Bari mu gwada wannan.
Life will not be smooth.	Rayuwa ba za ta yi dadi ba.
One person who cares enough to take such an opportunity.	Mutum daya wanda ya kula da isa ya dauki irin wannan damar.
Everything works fine and well.	Komai yana aiki daidai kuma yayi kyau.
Whoever it is must be after all.	Duk wanda ya kasance dole ne ya kasance bayan komai.
And it was answered.	Kuma aka amsa.
That should not happen.	Hakan bai kamata ya faru ba.
Show her when no one is around.	Nuna mata lokacin da babu kowa a kusa.
She is not very big.	Ba ta da girma sosai.
In this way she admits that he was right.	A haka ta yarda cewa yayi gaskiya.
Not many people will like this	Ba mutane da yawa za su so wannan ba
We hope we continue to work together.	Muna fata da mun ci gaba da aiki tare.
They will start later next week.	Za su fara daga baya mako mai zuwa.
It does more than we should.	Shi da yin fiye da ya kamata mu ba.
It should not have happened.	Bai kamata ya faru ba.
It is time to move on.	Lokaci ya yi da za a ci gaba.
If you drive slowly, you should not have any problems.	Idan kuna tuƙi a hankali, bai kamata ku sami matsala ba.
I think it really is.	Ina tsammanin shi ma da gaske ne.
This is also funny.	Wannan kuma yana da ban dariya.
Say it again, please.	Fada kuma, don Allah.
They certainly know her.	Lallai da alama sun san ta.
They are really looking for food.	Suna neman abinci da gaske.
She had to, she told him.	Dole ta yi, ta gaya masa.
Tell me someone, do it.	Gaya mani wani, yi.
This is for me.	Wannan shi ne a gare ni.
This work should be done tomorrow.	Wannan aikin ya kamata a yi gobe.
It's part of our plan.	Yana daga cikin shirin mu.
He is seriously injured.	Ya yi rauni sosai.
Life is very difficult.	Rayuwa ta yi wuya sosai.
They are coming completely!	Suna zuwa gaba daya!
That will not happen in two years.	Hakan ba zai faru nan da shekaru biyu ba.
So, they want to help me pay that price.	Don haka, suna son taimaka mini in biya wannan kuɗin.
The water is very cold.	Ruwan yayi sanyi sosai.
Things will get hot.	Abubuwa za su yi zafi.
That should not happen.	Bai kamata hakan ya faru ba.
They agreed not to speak.	Sun yarda ba za su yi magana ba.
Come back to us.	Dawo da mu.
Read on to see how it is purchased.	Karanta don ganin yadda ake siyan shi.
But today you are not so good.	Amma yau baka da kyau sosai.
She cries for help.	Kuka take tana neman taimako.
If you are going to kill us, go ahead.	Idan za ku kashe mu, ku ci gaba.
So even if you want to do it, you can't.	Don haka ko da kuna son yin hakan, ba za ku iya ba.
No dog is coming to do anything good.	Babu wani kare da ke zuwa don yin wani abu mai kyau.
She loves her instantly.	Ta na son ta nan take.
Maybe we should be very happy there.	Wataƙila mu yi farin ciki sosai a can.
Help me to wait for it.	Ka taimake ni in jira shi.
He will accept things as they are.	Zai yarda da abubuwa kamar yadda suka faru.
I saw the end.	Na ga karshen.
A fish came up out of the water.	Wani kifi ya fito daga cikin ruwan.
I would love to though.	Zan so ko da yake.
Try not to sit back and sit on things.	Ka yi ƙoƙari kada ka zauna ka zauna a kan abubuwa.
There is a way to work on that.	Akwai hanyar yin aiki akan hakan.
He did not know how long it had been.	Bai san tsawon lokacin da ya wuce ba.
The reason we cannot know.	Dalilin da ba za mu iya sani ba.
But that's not what I want.	Amma ba haka nake so ba.
You hope they do.	Kuna fatan za su yi.
It is getting colder and colder.	Ana ƙara samun lokacin sanyi.
This is the only thing I can think of.	Wannan shi ne kadai zan iya tunanin.
You can't work any other way.	Ba za ku iya aiki ta wata hanya ba.
It is not so.	Shi ba haka ba ne.
And get them back safe.	Da kuma dawo da su lafiya.
That will come back, he thinks.	Hakan zai dawo, yana tunani.
That would be the right approach.	Wannan zai zama hanyar da ta dace.
I can talk about it carefully now.	Zan iya magana game da shi da hankali yanzu.
I do not seek to take lightly.	Ba na neman ɗauka da sauƙi.
It is not hard to see why this is so.	Ba shi da wuya a ga dalilin da ya sa hakan ya zama haka.
But it did not pass.	Amma bai wuce ba.
We saw little of each other.	Mun ga kadan daga juna.
I have no doubt about that.	Ba ni da wata shakka game da hakan.
I never thought he would commit suicide.	Ban taba tunanin zai kashe kansa ba.
We can't do that.	Ba za mu iya yin hakan ba.
He repeated that the train was coming for him.	Ya sake cewa jirgin na zuwa masa.
These are what they have always been.	Waɗannan su ne abin da suka kasance koyaushe.
They did the same next month.	Haka suka yi sauran wata mai zuwa.
Many people here do not get any.	Mutane da yawa a nan ba sa samun ko ɗaya.
I'm worried.	Na damu.
Get used to it and know how to get out of it.	Ku saba da shi kuma ku san yadda za ku fita daga ciki.
You don't know how to laugh or cry.	Baka san dariya ko kuka ba.
She understands that now.	Ta gane haka yanzu.
Now, you are just like everyone else.	Yanzu, kun zama kamar kowane mutum.
Time to move on though.	Lokaci don ci gaba ko da yake.
He was one of us.	Ya kasance daya daga cikin mu.
I love him.	Ina son shi.
He is a police officer.	Dan sanda ne.
But this is not.	Amma wannan ba.
But he went.	Amma ya tafi.
I asked a man how long this had happened.	Na tambayi wani mutum tsawon lokacin da wannan abu ya faru.
Generally, 'he said.	Kullum,' in ji shi.
But not tonight.	Amma ba wannan daren ba.
I like working with other people.	Ina son yin aiki tare da wasu mutane.
So far they have not found.	Ya zuwa yanzu ba su samu ba.
And he got one.	Kuma ya sami daya.
Does that sound familiar.	Shin hakan yana jin saba.
The marriage was happy.	Aure ya yi farin ciki.
Everything she did worked.	Duk abin da ta yi ya yi aiki.
It’s one about the future.	Yana daya game da gaba.
Really good movie.	Gaskiya mai kyau fim.
You have to come and recommend one.	Dole ne ku zo ku ba da shawarar daya.
But since then.	Amma tun daga lokacin.
I will.	zan yi.
He's gone, you can't help him anymore.	Ya tafi, ba za ku iya taimaka masa ba kuma.
No one else's place.	Babu wurin wani.
Otherwise, it will not do her any good.	Ban da haka, ba zai yi mata wani amfani ba.
It's not good.	Bai yi kyau ba.
And interesting reading too they do.	Kuma karatu mai ban sha'awa ma suna yi.
Not a little.	Ba kadan ba.
Put it in, prepare it.	Saka shi a ciki, shirya shi.
I am all.	Ni ne duka.
Like my girls.	Kamar 'yan mata na.
They are almost too late.	Sun kusan makara.
She pretended not to stop.	Ta yi kamar ba za ta tsaya ba.
He did not wait for the man to speak.	Bai jira mutumin yayi magana ba.
I want him to read to me.	Ina so ya karanta mani.
However, that night, something good happened.	Duk da haka, a wannan dare, wani abu mai kyau ya faru.
It may be all right.	Yana iya zama duk abin da yake daidai.
We're cold now.	Mun yi sanyi yanzu.
There is one of you.	Akwai daya daga cikin ku.
We were very cold with it.	Mun yi sanyi sosai da shi.
Many died.	Da yawa sun mutu.
This should be done sooner rather than later.	Wannan ya kamata ya yi sauri a wannan lokacin.
This is going to be difficult.	Wannan ya zama mai wahala.
For some, there is great joy in working.	Ga wasu, akwai babban farin ciki a cikin aiki.
I did a lot of things.	Na yi abubuwa da yawa.
It is understood he was killed.	An fahimci cewa an kashe shi.
So he got a new job.	Don haka ya sami sabon aiki.
Maybe I do the same now.	Wataƙila ma ina yin haka yanzu.
Keep this in mind.	Wannan ka tuna.
Car for driving.	Mota don tuƙi.
Tell me this is not true.	Faɗa min wannan ba gaskiya bane.
And we couldn't find it.	Kuma mun kasa gano shi.
She is not alone this time.	Ba ita kaɗai ba wannan lokacin.
I don't know where to look for trouble.	Ban san inda zan nemi matsala ba.
Not much, but little.	Ba da yawa ba, amma kaɗan.
But this is us.	Amma wannan mu ne.
But suppose we want more.	Amma a ce muna son ƙarin.
That's right.	Gaskiya shi ke nan.
However, this is still not clear to anyone.	Amma, har yanzu wannan bai bayyana ga kowa ba.
It's not good at all.	Bai dan yi kyau ba.
She caught his interest, and wanted to talk to her.	Ta kama sha'awar shi, kuma yana son yin magana da ita.
I decided some time ago.	Na yanke shawarar wani lokaci da ya wuce.
It's like a movie.	Kamar fim ne.
I was not afraid.	Ban ji tsoro ba.
Honestly, that's it.	Gaskiya, shi ke nan.
Some people are upset.	Wasu mutane sun damu.
But it's not, isn't it?	Amma ba haka ba ne, shin, ba haka ba ne.
It can be amazing.	Yana iya zama mai ban mamaki.
It’s kind of where it gives it.	Yana da irin inda ya ba da shi.
Like life, nothing is certain.	Kamar rayuwa, babu abin da ya tabbata.
I can still eat regularly.	Har yanzu ina iya cin abinci kullum.
I was devastated.	Bata min rai.
It is not a good movie.	Ba fim mai kyau ba ne.
It was a difficult time for me.	Ya kasance lokaci mai wahala a gare ni.
Years passed quickly.	Shekaru sun wuce da sauri.
My first attempt was a great success.	Ƙoƙari na na farko babban nasara ne.
If you want to talk to me, talk to me.	Idan kana son magana da ni, yi magana da ni.
If you are in this situation.	Idan kun kasance cikin hakan.
It's just right.	Daidai ne kawai.
What do we have here?	Me muke da shi a nan?
Make sure you look first.	Tabbatar kun duba farko.
I know this is something.	Na san wannan wani abu ne.
Help by.	Taimako ta hanyar.
You appear to proceed.	Kun bayyana don ci gaba.
That's why.	Shi ya sa.
And this is good.	Kuma wannan yana da kyau.
We will be there to take care of you.	Za mu kasance a can don kula da ku.
You see.	Kun ga haka.
You do all the work.	Kuna yin duk aikin.
He has no time to play.	Ba shi da lokacin wasa.
I think we have.	Ina tsammanin muna da.
So be careful not to cut yourself.	Don haka a kula kada ku yanke kanku.
People will like me.	Mutane za su so ni.
He never doubted.	Bai taba yin shakka ba.
I think he wouldn’t want anyone to call him that, though.	Ina tsammanin ba zai so wani ya kira shi ba, ko da yake.
However, it is thought-provoking.	Duk da haka, yana da tunani.
They never told us what to say.	Ba su taba gaya mana abin da za mu ce ba.
I do not want to tell the story.	Ba na so in ba da labarin.
No one went back.	Babu wanda ya koma baya.
Many more are not seen.	Ba a sake ganin mutane da yawa ba.
It's not like they'll leave anyone behind.	Ba kamar za su bar kowa ba.
Maybe something terrible will happen.	Wataƙila wani abu mai ban tsoro zai faru.
But he realized it was money.	Amma ya fahimci cewa kudi ne.
And live again through them.	Kuma sake rayuwa ta hanyar su.
We just.	Mu kawai.
He didn't play.	Bai yi wasa ba.
But there is no time.	Amma babu lokaci.
It's not too much.	Bai yi yawa ba.
It is time to put an end to this.	Lokaci ya yi da za a kawo karshen wannan.
I can't afford this.	Ba zan iya siyan wannan ba.
I ran home.	Na gudu har gida.
I think it's true.	Ina tsammanin gaskiya ne.
It's not a good thing.	Ba abu ne mai kyau ba.
The story has many interesting elements.	Labarin yana da abubuwan ban sha'awa da yawa.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu ya faru a cikin jirgin.
I'm having a bad day.	Ina cikin mummunan rana.
She continued to work.	Ta ci gaba da aikin.
Bring up.	Ta yarda.
Fortunately, there is something you can do.	Abin farin ciki, akwai abin da za ku iya yi.
You see he is right.	Ka ga ya yi gaskiya.
I would recommend it to others.	Zan ba da shawarar ga wasu.
Everything is in us.	Komai yana cikin mu.
He said something and went away.	Ya fad'a wani abu ya tafi.
It is very difficult to explain these things.	Yana da matukar wuya a bayyana waɗannan abubuwan.
Now he will not sleep.	Yanzu ba zai yi barci ba.
Work is good, but not too hot.	Aiki yana da kyau, amma ba zafi mai yawa ba.
She worked from home.	Ta yi aiki daga gida.
I said.	Na ce.
I was happy.	Na yi farin ciki.
there is no problem using it.	ba shi da matsala ta amfani da shi.
In the book, he leaves it uncertain.	A cikin littafin, ya bar shi da rashin tabbas.
And one funny thing.	Kuma abu ɗaya mai ban dariya.
You love them.	Kuna son su.
Travel is difficult.	Tafiya ke da wuya.
They have the tools.	Suna da kayan aiki.
Not true.	Ba gaskiya ba.
He wanted it.	Ya so shi.
It has to be mine.	Dole ne ya zama nawa.
There are so many things you will love here!	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za ku so a nan!
People wanted to come and see this place.	Mutane sun so su zo ganin wannan wuri.
Until then, we will stay safe.	Har sai lokacin, za mu zauna lafiya.
I'll leave it.	Zan bar shi.
We tried another.	Mun gwada wani.
Nor is it the end of the story.	Haka kuma ba karshen labarin ba ne.
We spent a lot of time talking.	Mun dauki lokaci mai yawa muna magana.
Forget that.	Ka manta da haka.
Kids love the movie.	Yara suna son fim ɗin.
But something is happening with this man there.	Amma wani abu yana faruwa da wannan mutumin a can.
But he did.	Amma sai ya yi.
She turned on the coffee slowly.	Ta kunna kofi a hankali.
Also try to sleep well.	Haka kuma a yi ƙoƙarin yin barci da kyau.
Which is why we thought maybe we should talk to them again.	Abin da ya sa muka yi tunanin cewa watakila mu ƙara yin magana da su.
Now she does not know what to think.	Yanzu ta rasa me zata yi tunani.
I never liked children.	Ban taba son yara ba.
Something went wrong.	Wani abu yayi kuskure.
He still hasn't.	Har yanzu bai yi ba.
Everything is going well.	Komai yana tafiya daidai.
We will not stop fighting.	Ba za mu daina fada ba.
If we don't come, let's go.	Idan ba mu zo ba, mu tafi.
Cover me.	Ka rufe ni.
They show more work.	Suna nuna ƙarin aiki.
You must do this carefully.	Dole ne ku yi wannan a hankali.
I talk to him every week.	Ina yi masa magana kowane mako.
I’ve never had that.	Ban taba samun haka ba.
No one has ever watched them.	Babu wanda ya taɓa kallon su.
You cannot afford such an opportunity.	Ba za ku iya ba da damar irin wannan damar ba.
I never got them again.	Ban sake samun su ba.
First, you must be a good swimmer.	Na farko, dole ne ku zama mai yin iyo mai kyau.
You are a great person.	Kai babban mutum ne.
She never felt better unless she helped others.	Bata taba jin dadi ba sai idan tana taimakon wasu.
She immediately decided to buy a house.	Nan take ta yanke shawarar siyan gida.
And even if you don’t, someone else will.	Kuma ko da ba ka yi ba, wani zai yi.
It is raining.	An yi ruwan sama.
Or just to talk.	Ko don yin magana kawai.
I can't do that.	Ba zan iya yin hakan ba.
Maybe, but not necessarily.	Wataƙila, amma ba lallai ba ne.
Do you have time?	Kuna da lokaci?
However with everything it does not work as intended.	Duk da haka tare da duk abin da ba ya aiki kamar yadda ake so.
Every home should have one.	Kowane gida ya kamata ya kasance yana da ɗaya.
There you have it.	Can kuna da shi.
They went and ran.	Suka tafi da gudu.
But it will also do no good.	Amma kuma ba zai yi wani amfani ba.
But no one wanted to go.	Amma babu wanda ya so ya tafi.
He cried, but said nothing.	Yayi kuka, amma bai ce komai ba.
You will not make a mistake.	Ba za ku yi kuskure ba.
If there was a home, he would be here.	Idan da akwai gida, da ya kasance a nan.
She was there one time and moved on.	Ta kasance a can lokaci daya kuma tafi gaba.
I'm afraid of what might come next.	Ina tsoron abin da zai iya zuwa.
She can't enter.	Ba za ta iya shiga ba.
We can go to anything.	Za mu iya tafiya zuwa komai.
That was not the time to be.	Ba wannan lokacin ya kasance ba.
And she enjoys working with it, too.	Kuma tana jin daɗin yin aiki da ita, ma.
You will come to life.	Za ku zo rayuwa.
They are still here.	Har yanzu suna nan.
It did not help.	Bai taimaka ba.
Never tell anyone anything that you do not have to.	Kada ku taɓa gaya wa kowa komai ba lallai ne ku ba.
I do not think so.	Ba na tunani.
I have everything here.	Ina da komai a nan.
This is indeed a happy time for me.	Lallai wannan lokacin farin ciki ne a gare ni.
Remember, you get what you pay for.	Ka tuna, kuna samun abin da kuke biya.
I hope it goes down.	Ina fatan ya tafi kasa.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
I think it's a good game.	Ina tsammanin wasa ne mai kyau.
I have so much to tell you.	Ina da abubuwa da yawa da zan gaya muku.
I really didn't get it.	Da gaske ban samu ba.
Once, twice, several times.	Sau ɗaya, sau biyu, sau da yawa.
Everyone said they were very happy.	Kowa ya ce suna da daɗi sosai.
She then asked why she loved me.	Sai ta tambayi dalilin da yasa take so na.
It was cold in every plane.	Da kowane jirgin sama ya yi sanyi.
Or maybe they haven’t changed anything.	Ko watakila ba su canza komai ba.
He went out to eat after the meeting.	Ya fita cin abinci bayan taron.
No one came to the ceremony.	Babu wanda ya zo bikin.
It seems familiar.	Ga alama saba.
Which, in a way, was.	Wanda, a wata hanya, ta kasance.
He fell into a trance.	Ya fad'a cikin rashin dad'i.
We have talked about this before.	Mun yi magana game da wannan a baya.
This was, however, some time later.	Wannan ya kasance, duk da haka, a wani lokaci daga baya.
Which is exactly what you see yourself doing.	Wanda shine ainihin abin da kuke gani kuna yi.
It feels early.	Yana jin da wuri.
You know how to do things that have surprised you in the past.	Kun san yadda ake yin abubuwan da a baya suka ba ku mamaki.
Love, love, love it.	So, so, son shi.
One failed, and now three are gone.	Daya kasa, kuma yanzu uku a tafi.
And if you want to stay.	Kuma idan kuna son zama.
I do not like it a little.	Ba na son shi kadan.
She didn't want to look at the man.	Bata son kallon mutumin.
This will get them here.	Wannan zai kai su nan.
I do not know for sure that mine.	Ban san tabbas cewa nawa ba.
That sounds like a surprise.	Wannan ya zama kamar abin ban mamaki.
Maybe time, it is easier than we think.	Wataƙila lokaci, ya fi sauƙi fiye da yadda muke tunani.
Know where he is.	Ku san inda yake.
They walk hand in hand.	Suna tafiya hannu da hannu.
We will never run away.	Ba za mu taba gudu ba.
And how much better the world is.	Kuma nawa ne duniya ta zama mafi kyau.
He did not do any of these things.	Bai yi ko ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan ba.
This is, in fact, what happened.	Wannan shi ne, a gaskiya, abin da ya faru.
She goes home and does not run away.	Tana zuwa gida bata gudu ba.
Don't let anyone talk to you.	Kar ka bari wani ya yi maka magana.
It works or it doesn't work.	Yana aiki ko baya aiki.
Now move on.	Yanzu ci gaba.
Thoughtful and intelligent.	Mai tunani da hankali.
The only way we can grow is if we change.	Hanyar da za mu iya girma ita ce idan muka canza.
Everyone laughs but you.	Kowa yayi dariya amma kai.
Maybe he stayed back a year.	Wataƙila ya zauna baya shekara guda.
One time she was there, the next one was gone.	Lokaci daya tana nan, na gaba ta tafi.
I know a lot about you.	Na san abubuwa da yawa game da ku.
But, go and die.	Amma, tafi ya mutu.
This they failed to do.	Wannan sun kasa yi.
She grew up, however, amazing.	Ta girma, duk da haka, abin mamaki ne.
Until she.	Har sai da ita.
I love it there.	Ina son shi a can.
When he went, he cried even louder, not less.	Inda ya je sai kuka ya kara yi, ba kasa ba.
He admits he made a mistake.	Ya yarda cewa yayi kuskure.
But if she can.	Amma idan ta iya.
It adds to the surprise.	Yana ƙara ɗaukar abin mamaki.
And they got back to where they started.	Kuma sun dawo daidai inda suka fara.
Actually I have never been married.	A gaskiya ban taba yin aure ba.
And you can sing too.	Kuma kuna iya waƙa kuma.
It could be wrong, of course.	Yana iya yin kuskure, ba shakka.
It is hard to read about every day.	Yana da wuya a karanta game da kowace rana.
It can kill him easily.	Zai iya kashe shi cikin sauƙi.
How can that be?	Ta yaya hakan zai iya faruwa.
Give me time to think.	Ka ba ni lokaci in yi tunani.
So, so are the cuts.	Saboda haka, haka ma abubuwan da aka yanke.
I never tried to think about making money.	Ban taɓa ƙoƙarin yin tunani game da samun kuɗi ba.
The rest are intelligent.	Sauran suna da hankali.
But then it came.	Amma sai abin ya zo.
Drink plenty of cold water.	A sha ruwan sanyi mai yawa.
He felt better at home.	Ya kara ji a gida.
And a hot day	Da rana mai zafi
It will not be the same.	Shi ma ba zai kasance haka ba.
Someone spoke to me.	Wani mutum yayi min magana.
Of course they didn't say anything.	Tabbas ba su ce komai ba.
That's what you think.	Haka kuke tunani.
Actually this is not enough.	A gaskiya wannan bai isa ba.
I knew her for years before we met.	Na san ta tsawon shekaru kafin mu hadu.
The children enjoyed a good night's sleep.	Yara sun ji daɗin barci mai daɗi.
That's what you want.	Abin da kuke so ke nan.
In fact, children need to move on.	A gaskiya ma, yara suna bukatar su ci gaba.
She was in the best position.	Ta kasance a wuri mafi kyau.
It will be very difficult.	Zai zama babban wahala sosai.
To swim together.	Don yin iyo tare.
But they did not stay with him.	Amma ba su zauna tare da shi ba.
Any help would be fine.	Duk wani taimako zai yi kyau.
This made him very sad.	Hakan ya bata masa rai.
Play or two.	Wasa ko biyu.
It is still something we do to this day.	Har yanzu wani abu ne da muke yi har yau.
One by one.	Daya bayan daya.
I don't care how.	Ban damu da yaya ba.
If desired, great.	Idan ana so ana so, mai girma.
She was amazing.	Ta kasance mai ban mamaki.
Right scared.	Dama ya ji tsoro.
I finally enjoyed it.	A ƙarshe na ji daɗi da shi.
Do not allow it to be tested.	Kar a ba da damar gwada ta.
They can get it.	Suna iya samun shi.
Some may come.	Wasu na iya zuwa.
It was the best job we were given so far.	Ya kasance mafi kyawun aiki da aka ba mu ya zuwa yanzu.
It will take a while.	Zai yi ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
He was sure he got it.	Ya tabbata cewa ya samu.
He came back to him.	Ya dawo gare shi.
And not us.	Kuma ba mu.
Nothing is true.	Babu wani abu da yake gaskiya.
No one says big time is easy.	Babu wanda ya ce babban lokaci yana da sauƙi.
But he did nothing.	Amma bai yi komai ba.
She was scared.	Da ta ji tsoro.
But it never came true.	Amma bai taba zama gaskiya ba.
We do things that only we can do.	Muna yin abubuwan da kawai za mu iya yi.
I hit	na buga
Good things today, people.	Abubuwa masu kyau a yau, mutane.
But we are close.	Amma muna kusa.
It's true.	Gaskiya ne.
Somewhere the water ran.	Wani wuri ruwa ya gudu.
He did not come out.	Bai fito ba.
We do not want to send them later than that.	Ba ma so mu aika da su daga baya fiye da haka.
Suddenly a thought occurred to him.	Nan da nan wani tunani ya zo masa.
This works fine.	Wannan yana aiki lafiya.
She did nothing again.	Bata sake yin komai ba.
He wanted to go.	Ya so ya tafi.
Terrified, he ran away.	Ya ji tsoro, sai ya gudu.
They are tired of waiting.	Sun gaji da jira.
It didn't work.	Bai yi amfani ba.
Maybe nothing.	Wataƙila babu komai.
I think you know that too.	Ina tsammanin ku ma kun san hakan.
What a wonderful trip you made for us.	Abin ban sha'awa tafiya da kuka yi mana.
That's right.	Daidai ne.
He left it a little late.	Ya bar shi kadan kadan.
Maybe he can think of it.	Wataƙila zai iya yin tunani da shi.
We all make mistakes, it seems.	Mu duka muna yin kuskure, da alama.
I enjoy doing this work.	Ina jin daɗin yin wannan aikin.
He raises his hand and cries.	D'aga hannu yayi sama yana kuka.
I love people.	Ina son mutane.
So he went in search of water.	Don haka, ya tafi neman ruwa.
I know it's one.	Na san yana da daya.
Will you help ?.	Za ku taimaka?.
We called it the next room.	Muka kira shi dakin gaba.
But some do not.	Amma wasu ba sa.
But not many girls.	Amma ba 'yan mata da yawa ba.
He spoke to him.	Yayi masa magana .
Give it a chance if you can.	Ka ba da dama idan za ka iya.
Don't worry about that.	Kada ku damu da hakan.
He is behind the man who ran away.	Yana bayan mutumin da ya gudu.
If she had not seen it, she would not have believed it.	Da ba ta gani ba, da ba za ta yarda ba.
No, it is not.	A'a, ba haka ba ne.
I can't see the road.	Na kasa ganin hanya.
Otherwise she would not do it.	In ba haka ba ba za ta yi ba.
I know exactly what happened, and yet.	Na san ainihin abin da ya faru, kuma duk da haka.
A woman is saying that.	Wata mata tana magana haka.
We want to see them!	Muna son ganin su!
Do the last, before you do the first.	Yi na ƙarshe, kafin ku yi na farko.
I need to get home.	Ina bukata in isa gida.
After a while she stopped for lunch.	Bayan wani lokaci ta tsaya cin abincin rana.
But it is not necessary if you do not want to.	Amma ba dole ba ne idan ba ka so.
The latter gave me a very real name.	Na karshen ya ba ni suna sosai.
No one should really be surprised.	Babu wanda ya kamata ya yi mamakin gaske.
I am very happy for all of you.	Ina matukar farin ciki da ku duka.
This surprised many.	Wannan ya ba mutane da yawa mamaki.
And that was only temporary.	Kuma hakan ya kasance na ɗan lokaci.
And this is what you see.	Kuma wannan kuke gani.
And he died instantly.	Kuma ya mutu nan take.
We came here last night.	Mun zo nan a daren jiya.
Other than that, nothing has changed.	Ban da wannan, babu abin da ya canza.
But for now.	Amma a yanzu.
He's tired, one thing.	Ya gaji, abu daya.
It was useful things.	Ya kasance abubuwa masu amfani.
We live on it.	Muna rayuwa a kai.
I tried to find out what happened.	Na yi ƙoƙari in gano abin da ya faru.
Wait a moment, please.	Jira na ɗan lokaci, don Allah.
If it is to continue, it must be changed.	Idan za a ci gaba, ya kamata a canza.
The children are crying.	Yara suna kuka.
You should go.	Ya kamata ku tafi.
Every trip is a slow one.	Duk tafiya ta hankali ce.
He gets everything over everything.	Yana samun komai akan komai.
I'm getting better now, just tired.	Ina kara kyau yanzu, kawai gaji.
Maybe no one has shown you this before.	Wataƙila babu wanda ya nuna maka wannan a baya.
Many people came.	Mutane da yawa sun zo.
Pay in advance.	Biya a gaba.
I think that is very strange.	Ina tsammanin hakan yana da ban mamaki sosai.
The police were called.	An kira 'yan sanda.
Everything works fine.	Komai yana aiki sosai.
She came back that way.	Ta dawo haka.
But it does not work.	Amma ba ya aiki.
Hope you have a great week.	Da fatan kuna da mako mai kyau.
Every time they stopped.	Duk lokacin da suka tsaya.
The killer was killed.	An kashe wanda ya kashe shi.
This person has never been seen again.	Ba a sake ganin wannan mutumin ba.
It looks like a fish.	Ga alama irin kifi ne.
We are waiting.	Muna jira.
Because they have no one, you see.	Don ba su da kowa, ka gani.
They do not, she said.	Ba haka suke yi ba, ta ce.
I can not leave you.	Ba zan iya barin ku ba.
What comes next must be active.	Abin da ya zo na gaba dole ne ya zama aiki.
We will never know why.	Ba za mu taɓa gane dalilin ba.
Once, once, we stayed home.	Sau ɗaya, sau ɗaya, mun zauna gida.
He didn't seem to mind.	Da alama bai damu ba.
He knew that day would come and that would now come.	Ya san wannan ranar za ta zo kuma yanzu ta zo.
And maybe there, we will get a chance.	Kuma watakila a can, za mu sami wata dama.
One chance to catch her here.	Damar ku ɗaya don kama ita a nan.
He opened them again.	Ya sake bude su.
It has to happen.	Dole ne ya faru.
She could not do more than that.	Ba za ta iya yin abin da ya fi haka ba.
I failed.	Na kasa.
The one who spends just spends all his money.	Wanda ya kashe kawai ya kashe da duk kuɗin.
Interesting, for metal, but still metal.	Ban sha'awa, ga karfe, amma har yanzu karfe.
She did not know how long she had been traveling.	Ba ta san tsawon lokacin da ta yi tafiya ba.
So let's put this here.	Don haka bari mu sanya wannan a nan.
They want to travel, but they have no money.	Suna so su yi tafiya, amma ba su da kuɗi.
You will stop here.	Za ku tsaya a nan.
It was sunny yesterday.	Jiya ta yi rana.
You do not have to save them.	Ba sai ka ajiye su ba.
There really is something for everyone.	Da gaske akwai wani abu ga kowa da kowa.
And he lost the place he had never felt at home.	Kuma ya rasa wurin da ya taɓa ji a gida.
There are other uncertainties, however.	Akwai sauran rashin tabbas, duk da haka.
I'll give you one chance, though.	Zan ba ku dama guda ɗaya, ko da yake.
Many people were surprised, though.	Mutane da yawa sun yi mamaki, ko da yake.
I gave him my first kiss.	Na yi masa baka na farko.
When you arrive.	Lokacin da ka isa.
Their need is completely met.	Bukatar su ta ci karo gaba daya.
He is a wonderful man.	Mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
She was great.	Ta kasance mai girma.
He makes it why.	Ya sa shi ya sa.
And laugh.	Kuma a yi dariya.
This will not be easy.	Wannan ba zai kasance mai sauƙi ba.
It has changed twice in the past.	Ya canza sau biyu a baya.
This man began to prepare breakfast.	Wannan mutumin ya fara shirya abincin safe.
That's what you see.	Abin da kuke gani ke nan.
Finally, "he learned to walk again".	A ƙarshe, "ya koyi tafiya kuma".
She loves the things you love.	Tana son abubuwan da kuke so.
You can move on.	Kuna iya ci gaba.
Work on the next problem.	Yi aiki da matsala mai zuwa.
I know it's hard.	Na san yana da wuya.
I will not change it.	Ba zan canza shi ba.
Can't go out tonight, maybe not recommended to go out tomorrow.	Ba za a iya fita yau da dare, watakila ba da shawarar fita gobe.
He entered through the back door.	Ya shiga ta kofar baya.
He stopped flying.	Ya daina tashi.
He was.	Ya kasance.
Let him tell the story himself.	Bari ya ba da labarin da kansa.
to say.	in ce.
Here is the man.	Ga mutumin nan.
This is their favorite food.	Wannan shine abincin da suka fi so.
She had to talk to him about it.	Dole ta yi masa magana game da hakan.
No one can do that.	Babu wanda zai iya yin hakan.
Probably more than a few.	Wataƙila fiye da 'yan kaɗan.
It is easy to see why this is so.	Yana da sauƙi a ga dalilin da ya sa hakan ya faru.
Feeling open to me.	Ji ya bude ni.
They will not say they know.	Ba za su ce sun sani ba.
She will be around until after lunch.	Zata kasance a kusa da ita sai bayan abincin rana.
I think they did exactly what they were going to do.	Ina tsammanin sun yi daidai abin da za su yi.
Time is running out.	Lokaci yana tafiya.
But we can do this only if we know it.	Amma za mu iya yin hakan ne kawai idan mun sani.
So next time, think a little.	Don haka lokaci na gaba, yi tunani kaɗan.
Everyone is required every day to play.	Ana buƙatar kowa kowace rana don yin wasa.
She brought him to life.	Ta kawo shi rai.
He can join	Zai iya shiga
As usual here.	Kamar yadda aka saba a nan.
But no such thing has ever happened.	Amma babu irin wannan abu da ya faru.
Exciting things await you.	Abubuwan ban sha'awa suna jiran ku.
It will be hot, of course.	Zai zama mai zafi, tabbas.
I enjoyed the time.	Na ji daɗin lokacin.
They are full of.	Sun cika da.
I have never seen.	Ban taba gani ba.
I highly recommend it !.	Ina ba da shawarar shi!.
He decided to travel the world.	Ya yanke shawarar tafiya duniya.
And they do not have to go together.	Kuma ba lallai ba ne su tafi tare.
Next he just closed the door.	Gaba kawai yayi ya rufe kofar.
That did not make him aware of it.	Hakan bai sa ya kara sanin hakan ba.
Tell us.	Ka gaya mana.
You know this just like us.	Kun san wannan kamar mu.
Don't get inside or anything.	Kar ku isa ciki ko wani abu.
That is what made her interested.	Abin da ya sanya ta sha'awa ke nan.
Are you sure about that?	Kun tabbata akan wannan?.
It is not necessarily as simple as one might think.	Ba lallai ba ne mai sauƙi kamar yadda mutum zai yi tunani.
This is a great man.	Wannan babban mutum ne.
At the time, it was definitely nothing.	A lokacin, tabbas ba komai.
But he doesn't know her very well.	Amma bai san ta sosai ba.
That sounds good.	Yayi kyau haka.
Our game is over.	Wasan mu yayi.
He went on to say.	Ya ci gaba da cewa.
This too is difficult.	Wannan ma yana da wahala.
This is a little difficult to achieve, however.	Wannan yana da ɗan wahala don samun nasara, duk da haka.
They wanted to wait until after these.	Sun so su jira sai bayan waɗannan.
So for sure.	Don haka ya tabbata.
She wanted it.	Ta so shi.
We have.	Muna da.
She hopes it will help.	Ta saka da fatan hakan zai taimaka.
It did me good.	Ya yi min kyau.
Lying is a must.	Yin karya dole ne.
But that's what you get.	Amma abin da kuke samu ke nan.
I do not have time.	Ba ni da lokaci.
Good thing here.	Abu mai kyau a nan.
Everything can be true.	Komai na iya zama gaskiya.
But that's it.	Amma shi ke nan.
See you next month.	Sai wata mai zuwa.
There is no way to understand.	Babu yadda za ku gane.
Something wonderful is happening now.	Wani abin mamaki ya faru a yanzu.
She couldn't, so she ran.	Ba za ta iya ba, don haka ta yi gudu.
I hope you enjoyed the book.	Ina fatan kun ji daɗin littafin.
It looks good on the outside as well as on the inside.	Yana da kyau a waje da ciki ma.
I can live with these.	Zan iya rayuwa tare da waɗannan.
A little while, it seems.	Dan lokaci kadan, da alama.
Sleep with him tonight.	Barci da shi yau da dare.
I had to find a way to tell her what was going on.	Dole ne in gano hanyar da zan gaya mata abin da ke faruwa.
This is correct.	Wannan daidai ne.
I won.	Na ci nasara.
Don't give me that look.	Kar ka min wannan kallon.
It seems inappropriate for us here.	Ga alama a gare mu bai dace ba a nan.
Some are full of illness.	Wasu sun cika da rashin lafiya.
I think they are amazing.	Ina tsammanin suna da ban mamaki.
I don’t feel it will do though.	Ba na jin zai yi ko da yake.
I have been ill for two years.	Na yi rashin lafiya tsawon shekaru biyu.
There was a problem.	An sami matsala.
Go said.	Tafi yace.
We want him to prove it.	Muna son ya tabbatar da hakan.
I suggest that it must be stopped.	Na nuna cewa dole ne a daina.
It is useless to think about it.	Ba shi da amfani a yi tunani game da shi.
I am having lunch tomorrow.	Ina cin abincin rana gobe.
But no one was there.	Amma babu kowa a wurin.
I am the only one here.	Ni kadai ne a nan.
No one believed her.	Babu wanda ya yarda da ita.
It is the story of two people in a palace.	Labarin mutane biyu ne a cikin fada.
That did not happen here.	Hakan bai faru ba a nan.
Only children.	Yara ne kawai.
Walking is good for life.	Tafiya yana da kyau ga rai.
They sat without saying a word.	Suka zauna ba tare da sun yi magana ba.
This method is being modified.	Ana gyara wannan hanyar.
I am the right person.	Ni ne mutumin da ya dace.
There are three.	Akwai uku.
Ask them about surprises.	Tambaye su game da abubuwan mamaki.
You have been planning this for years.	Kun shirya wannan tsawon shekaru.
So, if you don't mind, let's finish this.	Don haka, idan ba ku damu ba, bari mu gama wannan.
With him everyone is equal.	Da shi kowa daidai yake.
Little is known about it.	Akwai kadan da aka sani game da shi.
We must do the right thing.	Dole ne mu yi abin da ya dace.
I'm a little tired.	Na dan gaji.
That will take you so far, so far.	Wannan zai kai ku haka, ya zuwa yanzu.
Of course you heard.	Tabbas kun ji.
Think in the world not in the home.	Yi tunani a duniya ba a cikin gida ba.
The man is well known.	An san mutumin sosai.
Me too.	Ni kuma.
I feel like crying.	Ina jin kamar kuka.
He plays the game slowly.	Yana kunna wasan da hankali.
She never left.	Ta dan taba ka tafi.
I want you to be serious about that.	Ina so ku kasance da gaske game da wannan.
Then I bought.	Sai na saya.
Or stop.	Ko kuma ku tsaya.
They will come back.	Za su dawo.
Acknowledging the discomfort.	Yarda da rashin jin daɗi.
I asked what?	Na tambayi menene?
Things are much better.	Abubuwa sun fi kyau.
He will see it.	Zai ga haka.
He has no time to lose.	Ba shi da lokacin rasa.
In fact we can not happen at all.	A gaskiya ba za mu iya faruwa gaba daya.
This is if you are interested in anything.	Wannan idan kana da sha'awar komai.
This is the first time it has been shown.	Wannan shine karo na farko da aka nuna.
I will be there all night.	Zan kasance a can duk dare.
There is so much of it.	Akwai da yawa daga gare shi.
But it is not enough.	Amma bai isa ba.
I don't want to sleep yet.	Ban so barci ba tukuna.
Nothing has ever been confirmed.	Ba a taɓa tabbatar da wani abu ba.
I saw a man sitting there.	Na ga wani mutum zaune a wurin.
I thought we were going.	Na dauka za mu je.
But it is better.	Amma ya fi kyau.
That's right.	Haka yake.
It's scary.	Abin tsoro ne.
Ill, but not too sick.	Rashin lafiya, amma ba ma rashin lafiya ba.
Maybe they will be right.	Wataƙila za su yi daidai.
Just get up.	Kawai tashi.
Tell me what is right.	Faɗa mini abin da ya dace.
I really like it.	Da gaske na fi so.
Of course, this is for children.	Tabbas hakan na yara ne.
They replied that they did not know.	Suka amsa da cewa ba su sani ba.
I wondered why he asked me.	Na yi mamakin dalilin da ya sa ya tambaye ni.
And so it is.	Kuma haka abin yake.
Do it at the same time.	Yi shi lokaci guda.
I can not know if it is so.	Ba zan iya sanin ko haka ne ba.
Of course there is discomfort.	Tabbas akwai rashin jin daɗi.
They are fast, easy and fun too.	Suna da sauri, sauƙi da kuma jin daɗi kuma.
I can't do that.	Ba zan iya yin hakan ba.
We broke you.	Mun karya ku.
We did just that.	Mun yi daidai da haka.
Whatever you do, keep it up.	Duk abin da kuke yi, ci gaba da shi.
We did not stop.	Ba mu daina ba.
Maybe he doesn't like it.	Wataƙila ba ya son hakan.
She is still not ready to go.	Har yanzu bata shirya tafiya ba.
Sorry, we arrived at your destination?	Ku yi hakuri, mun isa wurin ku?
I feel we can't.	Ina jin ba za mu iya ba.
Or it should be known.	Ko kuma ya kamata a sani.
She feels uncomfortable.	Ta ji ba dadi.
He certainly came from another country.	Babu shakka ya fito daga wata kasa.
We have some kind of problem.	Muna da wata irin matsala.
So it's somewhere.	Don haka yana wani wuri.
He felt lost.	Ya ji a rasa.
I read it all.	Na karanta duka.
They enter.	Suna shiga.
It is bigger than anything to be completely out of the way.	Yana da girma sama da komai don zama gaba ɗaya daga hanya.
Surely this person will help.	Tabbas wannan mutumin zai taimaka.
And he loves her with him.	Kuma yana son ta tare da shi.
It felt like home.	Ya zama kamar gida.
No one should do that.	Babu wanda ya isa ya yi haka.
They seem to know such things.	Da alama sun san irin waɗannan abubuwa.
The person has all the tools to be great.	Mutumin yana da duk kayan aikin da zai zama mai girma.
But not in the way you would think.	Amma ba ta hanyar da za ku yi tunani ba.
So it was amazing.	Haka ta kasance abin mamaki.
Just remember and you will be amazed at what you get.	Ka tuna kawai kuma za ku yi mamakin abin da kuka samu.
What he saw there surprised him.	Abin da ya gani a wurin ya ba shi mamaki.
This car does not exist.	Babu wannan motar.
After running almost.	Bayan gudu kusan.
It started immediately.	Nan take ya fara.
We are, really.	Mu ne, da gaske.
He loves it.	Yana son shi.
I will sleep well.	Zan yi barci da kyau.
How long has she been studying?	Tun yaushe take karatu?
He wanted to work harder.	Ya so ya kara yin aiki.
I don't care about anything.	Ban damu da komai ba.
I'm coming again.	Ina sake zuwa.
I'll call you and what's going on.	Zan kira ku da abin da ke faruwa.
But it does not seem to work.	Amma da alama baya aiki.
I love you so much.	Ina son ku da yawa.
Even if she increases her interest, nothing can happen.	Ko da ta ƙara sha'awar, babu abin da zai iya faruwa.
It feels good to stay for a while.	Ji yayi dadi ya zauna na dan wani lokaci.
He found nothing.	Bai sami komai ba.
They found it difficult to leave him alone.	Sun sami wuya su bar shi kadai.
However, the problem persists.	Duk da haka, matsalar ta ci gaba har yanzu.
She certainly could not care.	Lallai ta kasa kula.
Never enter the room.	Kar a taba shiga dakin.
I do not know where to look.	Ban san inda zan duba ba.
She doesn't know many things.	Ba ta san abubuwa da yawa ba.
We have a train.	Muna da jirgin kasa.
It seems too much.	Da alama yayi yawa.
He recognized the look.	Ya gane kallon.
To be close to people.	Don zama kusa da mutane.
Better not, better.	Gara ba, mafi kyau ba.
The big sad thing is that so many kids are watching this program.	Babban abin bakin ciki shi ne yara da yawa ke kallon wannan shirin.
It must be here somewhere.	Dole ya kasance a nan wani wuri.
I hope you will too.	Ina fatan za ku kuma.
I can take it.	Zan iya ɗauka.
From the beginning.	Tun daga farko.
They are hard but they are good for kids.	Suna da wuya amma suna da kyau ga yara.
The second time in a week.	Lokaci na biyu a cikin mako guda.
This problem is still open.	Wannan matsalar har yanzu a bude take.
And things did not go well.	Kuma abubuwa ba su yi kyau ba.
He is a difficult player.	Dan wasa ne mai wahala.
She wants from here.	Ta so daga nan.
Unlike other children.	Ba kamar sauran yara ba.
I am behind you.	Ina bayan ku.
So now, it's your turn.	Don haka yanzu, lokacin ku ne.
But she slept in most ways.	Amma ta yi barci a mafi yawan hanya.
If not, ask everyone around you.	Idan ba haka ba, tambayi kowa a kusa da ku.
But two things.	Amma abubuwa biyu.
They will do whatever it takes.	Za su yi duk abin da ya kamata.
He can, or not.	Ya iya, ko a'a.
There is no more that.	Babu sauran cewa.
Speak whatever you want.	Yi magana duk abin da kuke so.
The first is man.	Na farko mutum ne.
The plane died instantly.	Jirgin ya mutu nan take.
But it still happens.	Amma har yanzu yana faruwa.
I think there is something wrong.	Ina tsammanin akwai wani kuskure.
He is being arrested.	Ana kama shi.
If you want to go, go now.	Idan kuna son tafiya, tafi yanzu.
They say ‘we know something you don’t look like.	Suna da cewa 'mun san wani abu da ba ku yi kama da su ba.
He stopped sleeping well.	Ya daina barci mai kyau.
It should be really amazing.	Ya kamata ya zama mai ban mamaki sosai.
It's very exciting.	Abin farin ciki ne sosai.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
Two things stand out.	Abubuwa biyu sun tsaya a waje.
This is not necessarily true.	Wannan ba lallai ba ne gaskiya.
It's not hot.	Ba abu mai zafi ba ne.
No big player does.	Babu wani babban dan wasa da yake yi.
It doesn't matter.	Bata damu ba.
I can't add.	Ba zan iya ƙara ba.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
It could be you or me.	Tana iya zama kai ko ni.
We must exercise caution here.	Dole ne mu yi amfani da hankali a nan.
And he was with me.	Kuma ya kasance tare da ni.
It's time to grow up.	Lokaci ya yi da za a girma.
Each time at the same time.	Kowane lokaci a lokaci guda.
Get up in the afternoon and do it again.	Tashi da rana ka sake yi.
There is definitely something wrong with it.	Babu shakka wani abu ba daidai ba a tare da shi.
There was no answer for me.	Da babu amsa na shiga.
I want to see what you are up to.	Ina so in kalli abin da kuke ciki.
However, something must be done,	Duk da haka, dole ne a yi wani abu,
They do not see.	Ba sa gani.
He did not put them in the first place.	Bai sa su can farko ba.
When asked, they said nothing.	Da aka tambaye su, ba su ce komai ba.
He must take a hand.	Dole ne ya ɗauki hannu.
Just no way they can do it.	Kawai ba yadda za su iya yi.
You do not know how it is.	Ba ku san yadda yake ba.
I will not run away.	Ba zan gudu ba.
She is getting better.	Tana samun lafiya.
This all works really well.	Wannan duk yana aiki da kyau sosai.
This is something.	Wannan wani abu ne.
This is the same feeling.	Wannan ji ɗaya ne.
Once he fell.	Sau d'aya ya fad'a.
And she was smart.	Kuma ta kasance mai hankali.
He knew at that time he should be here.	Ya san a wannan lokacin ya kamata ya kasance a nan.
Or what to do next.	Ko abin da za mu yi gaba.
There is little.	Akwai kadan.
And from there everything changed.	Kuma daga can komai ya canza.
We will come to you.	Za mu zo muku.
Immediately the door opened.	Nan take kofar ta bude.
And again, they would have needed it now.	Kuma a sake, da sun sami bukata a yanzu.
What will happen next.	Me hakan zai faru.
And it's great.	Kuma yana da girma.
It was a difficult but enjoyable job.	Aiki ne mai wuya amma mai daɗi.
We hear.	Muna ji.
You must feel that way.	Dole ne ku ji haka.
It rained heavily at night.	An yi ruwan sama sosai a cikin dare.
You will not go and give it to me.	Ba za ku je ku ba ni ba.
And they took up a lot of space.	Kuma sun dauki wuri da yawa.
Inside and out.	Ciki da waje.
I have a good job, so there is this.	Ina da aiki mai kyau, don haka akwai wannan.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
This is bigger than me.	Wannan ya fi ni girma.
We want to buy it.	Muna so mu saya shi.
It can’t just be a game.	Ba zai iya zama wasa kawai ba.
For me now, it's the only thing in the world.	A gare ni yanzu, shi ne kawai abu a duniya.
They cannot leave well alone.	Ba za su iya barin da kyau ba su kadai.
Maybe there are more of them on board.	Wataƙila akwai ƙarin su a cikin jirgin.
Or like it.	Ko son shi.
He is now.	Ya kasance yanzu.
They really need to succeed at home.	Suna buƙatar samun nasara a gida da gaske.
It works like this.	Yana aiki kamar haka.
It was a wonderful time.	Lokaci ne mai daɗi.
Pay.	Ku biya.
You can never do this again.	Ba za ku iya ƙara yin wannan ba.
I felt like a child.	Na ji kamar yaro.
Leave it to me.	Ka bar min shi.
A lot is happening.	Da yawa ke faruwa.
And if you were outside, you would be one of those things.	Kuma da kuna waje, da kun kasance ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan.
We will be there for lunch.	Za mu kasance a wurin don abincin rana.
I can't run.	Ba zan iya gudu ba.
The work was done without any problems.	An yi aikin ba tare da wata matsala ba.
But we have one more year.	Amma muna da ƙarin shekara guda.
It is not as difficult as it looks.	Ba shi da wahala kamar yadda yake gani.
I think everyone has things that, if we look back, we would have changed.	Ina tsammanin kowa yana da abubuwan da, idan muka kalli baya, da mun canza.
Even me.	Ko da ni ne.
You have this.	Kuna da wannan.
I think here.	Ina tunani a nan.
I am not even sure what to say.	Ban ma tabbatar da abin da zan ce ba.
The work done.	Aikin da aka yi.
The eater took extra food assistance.	Mai cin abinci ya ɗauki ƙarin taimakon abinci.
But first again.	Amma da farko kuma.
Boat written.	An rubuta jirgin ruwa.
It was then that he realized she was gone.	A lokacin ne ya fahimci cewa ta tafi.
I know we did not.	Na san ba mu yi ba.
I will go by myself.	Zan tafi da kaina.
Happy to use.	Ya yi farin ciki don amfani.
So two things.	Don haka abubuwa biyu.
He used to get everything he wanted.	Ya saba samun duk abin da yake so.
I do not feel this is right.	Ba na jin wannan daidai ne.
I could just die.	Zan iya kawai mutu.
I sleep outside.	Ina kwana a waje.
No one is home except me.	Ba kowa a gida sai ni.
I do not feel needed here.	Ba na jin bukata a nan.
She just cried.	Kawai sai ta yi kuka.
Others can.	Wasu kuma suna iya.
Everyone knows everything.	Kowa ya san komai.
And so on.	Kuma haka a.
People are happy too.	Mutane ma sun yi farin ciki da hakan.
And they are.	Kuma su ne.
She left you.	Ta bar ka.
He said he would talk to them personally.	Ya ce zai yi magana da su da kansa.
That they think they know everything.	Cewa suna tunanin sun san komai.
Now they can see clearly.	Yanzu za su iya gani sosai.
The restaurant offers terrific food.	Gidan cin abinci yana ba da abinci mai ban tsoro.
Just a little bit.	Kaɗan kaɗan kawai.
He had to defend himself.	Dole ne ya kare kansa.
But finding the truth is not an easy task.	Amma ba aiki mai sauƙi ba ne samun gaskiya.
But they did not succeed.	Amma ba su yi nasara ba.
He did not go.	Bai tafi ba.
I need to make a call	Ina bukata in yi kira
Whether you like it or not, you have to get involved.	Ko kuna so ko ba ku so, dole ne ku shiga.
Try to work correctly and carefully.	Yi ƙoƙarin yin aiki daidai kuma a hankali.
It works for you.	Yana aikin ku.
Best of all.	Mafi kyau kuma.
I would never tell him that, though.	Ba zan taba gaya masa haka ba, ko da yake.
If so, he will return.	Idan haka ne, zai dawo.
You would never think that way but it does.	Ba za ku taɓa tunanin hakan ba amma yana yi.
We hope you enjoy it again !.	Muna fatan za ku ji daɗi kuma!.
He proved it, though.	Ya tabbatar da hakan, duk da haka.
In fact, it could not be.	A gaskiya, ba zai iya zama ba.
It shouldn’t surprise me.	Bai kamata ya bani mamaki ba.
No one will be able to help him.	Babu wanda zai taimake shi.
Or even use it properly.	Ko ma amfani da shi yadda ya kamata.
Do not waste this food.	Kar a bata wannan abincin.
You have two months.	Kuna da wata biyu.
I do not know exactly where they are.	Ban san ainihin inda suke ba.
It's too hot outside.	Waje yayi zafi sosai.
Let's not pretend.	Kada mu yi kamar ba haka ba.
She is OK.	Tana lafiya.
Maybe they don't fit.	Wataƙila ba su dace ba.
Actually, no, it still does.	A gaskiya, a'a, har yanzu yana yi.
Show people we are together.	Nuna wa mutane muna tare.
Although you do not know.	Ko da yake ba ku sani ba.
It just has to be true.	Dole ne kawai ya zama gaskiya.
The latter died there.	Na karshen ya mutu a can.
I have a bad feeling about this.	Ina da mummunan ji game da wannan.
So we left people alone.	Don haka muka bar mutane su kadai .
She should have heard it.	Ya kamata ta ji shi.
You better run the ball.	Gara ku iya gudu da ƙwallon.
It works entirely for such a book.	Yana aiki gaba ɗaya don irin wannan littafin.
No one helped him.	Babu wanda ya taimake shi.
They know this.	Sun san wannan.
This is not necessary.	Wannan ba lallai ba ne.
They refused to accept it.	Sun ƙi yarda da shi.
You are very interested in me.	Kuna sha'awar ni sosai.
Think this house is beautiful.	Tunani wannan gidan ya yi kyau.
We will hear from this, both of us.	Za mu ji daga wannan, mu biyu.
As always, it is a mistake.	Kamar yadda aka saba, kuskure ne.
We decided that before we even celebrated.	Mun yanke shawarar cewa kafin ma mu yi bikin.
Not a new person.	Ba sabon mutum ba.
When people are happy, they are happy.	Lokacin da mutane ke jin daɗi, suna jin daɗi.
Or hear everyone.	Ko ji kowa.
I had to stop thinking about that.	Dole na daina tunanin hakan.
I want to kill myself.	Ina so in kashe kaina.
As a surprise it is my thing.	Kamar abin mamaki shine abu na.
If you are seriously injured, please return home.	Idan kana jin rauni sosai, da fatan za a koma gidan.
Make sure the fish is very hot.	Tabbatar cewa kifi ya yi zafi sosai.
You know him, they know him.	Kun san shi, sun san shi.
It will never work.	Ba zai taba yin aiki ba.
You want me to bring them here.	Kun so in kawo su nan.
If it does not work.	Idan bai yi aiki ba .
Of course, that is difficult.	Tabbas hakan yayi wahala.
I was very close to them.	Na kasance kusa da su sosai.
He failed.	Ya kasa.
I plan to get some.	Ina shirin samun wasu .
Using too much of anything is wrong.	Yin amfani da kowane abu da yawa ba daidai ba ne.
But it is also a game.	Amma kuma wasa ne da su.
She sleeps with them, as she did last night.	Tana kwana da su, kamar yadda ta yi a daren jiya.
It is no longer difficult.	Ba shi da wahala kuma.
I hope you.	Ina muku fatan .
Had it not been for him.	Da ba a san shi ba.
Whoever enters wins.	Duk wanda ya shiga ya ci nasara.
But we can not leave.	Amma ba za mu iya barin ba.
He sat up and waited.	Ya tashi zaune yana jira.
It can really make you or break you.	Yana iya gaske sa ku ko karya ku.
The room is as nice as the place.	Dakin yayi kyau kamar wurin.
I know like that, but it's not true.	Na san kamar haka, amma ba gaskiya ba ne.
Great enough for me just.	Babban isa gare ni kawai.
But no, this is all funny.	Amma a'a, wannan duk abin ban dariya ne.
At one point nothing happened.	A wani lokaci babu abin da ya faru.
I could not believe it.	Na kasa yarda da hakan.
The house is very clear.	Gidan ya bayyana sosai.
He lost what he was feeling.	Ya rasa me yake ji.
He sleeps more than he does.	Yana barci fiye da yadda yake yi.
And we do.	Mu kuma muna yi.
This is each other.	Wannan shi ne juna.
We have some time.	Muna da ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
That should be sufficient enough.	Wannan ya isa sauƙi.
I will reach you.	Zan isa gare ku.
So in the end, he went on his own.	Don haka a ƙarshe, ya tafi da kansa.
More than anything.	Fiye da komai.
So it was interesting.	Don haka abin ya kasance mai ban sha'awa.
He is still the man.	Shi ne har yanzu mutumin.
He passed and looked.	Ya wuce ya duba.
And no one will tell me.	Kuma babu wanda zai gaya mani.
She will not let that happen.	Ba za ta bari hakan ya faru ba.
I did not go with anyone.	Ban tafi da kowa ba.
Then he heard it again.	Sai ya sake ji.
I was happy with these things.	Na yi farin ciki da waɗannan abubuwa.
I did not get it.	ban samu ba.
The place is coming to life.	Wuri yana zuwa rayuwa.
This material is suitable for the job.	Wannan kayan ya dace da aikin.
I tried this.	Na gwada wannan.
Just go right.	Kawai je dama.
I can't let it go.	Ba zan iya barin shi ya tafi ba.
People want health.	Mutane suna son lafiya.
He was a big boy.	Ya kasance babban yaro.
He kills them, but does not eat them.	Yana kashe su, amma ba cin su ba.
And you should too.	Kuma ya kamata ku ma.
As such.	Kamar haka.
Why should we not focus on them?	Me ya sa ba za mu mai da hankali a kan su ba?
And they are right.	Kuma sun yi gaskiya.
He used to work.	Ya kasance yana aiki.
These things are not right.	Ba waɗannan abubuwa daidai ba.
It is true.	Yana da gaskiya.
Everyone loves it.	Kowa ya so shi.
It may rain a little.	Zai iya yin ruwan sama kaɗan.
It is not the end.	Ba ƙarshe ba ne.
He did not move forward.	Bai yi gaba ba.
I will take care of you all.	Zan kula da ku duka.
I feel for you.	Ina ji da ku.
And it's not good.	Kuma ba shi da kyau.
She had to stop this.	Dole ta daina wannan.
It was realized only later.	An gane shi ne kawai daga baya.
I hope you like them.	Ina fatan za ku so su.
He got what many did not get.	Ya samu abin da da yawa ba su samu ba.
It will not come out.	Ba zai fito ba.
He said he could not recognize me.	Yace ya kasa gane ni.
Nothing will change in them.	Babu wani abu da zai canza a cikin su.
Could it be them? 	Zai iya zama su?
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
I never thought she could do that.	Ban taba tunanin zata iya hakan ba.
I think this should work faster.	Ina ganin wannan yakamata yayi aiki da sauri.
I know a lot of things.	Na san abubuwa da yawa.
But you did not do this simple homework.	Amma ba ku yi wannan aikin gida mai sauƙi ba.
I did not think so.	Ban yi tunani ba.
It's for the best.	Yana da ga mafi kyau.
As they used me.	Kamar yadda suka yi amfani da ni.
He wanted to show us something, he said.	Ya so ya nuna mana wani abu, in ji shi.
There are some things you will miss.	Akwai abubuwa na hankali da za ku rasa.
Or the best life.	Ko mafi kyawun rayuwa.
He succeeded on the road.	Ya yi nasara a kan hanya.
Yes, water.	Haka ne, ruwa.
He needs to reinvent himself.	Yana bukatar sake sanya kansa.
I do not want to be one.	Ban so zama ɗaya ba.
But today is the day.	Amma yau ita ce ranar.
Now it goes on and on.	Yanzu ya ci gaba da ci gaba.
I think you have a problem.	Ina tsammanin kuna da matsala.
We understand that.	Mun gane cewa.
He is still alive.	Har yanzu bai mutu ba.
I will make that decision.	Zan yanke wannan shawarar.
We did it for her.	Muka yi mata.
You shall not eat.	Ba za ku ci ba.
She does not drink regularly.	Bata sha kullum.
Then she came.	Sai ta zo.
It's just amazing.	Abin ban mamaki ne kawai.
Not everyone, exactly.	Ba kowa ba, daidai.
He admits that a lot is true.	Ya yarda cewa da yawa gaskiya ne.
It is also common to have children out of wedlock.	Haka kuma ana yawan samun ‘ya’ya ba tare da an yi aure ba.
Food and other foods.	Abinci da sauran abinci.
I can't wait, man.	Ba zan iya jira ba, mutum.
I do not know why that would be so.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa hakan zai kasance haka ba.
He said he could not.	Yace ba zai iya ba.
This is nothing new.	Wannan ba sabon abu bane.
If you are, you know, you wonder.	Idan kun kasance, kun sani, kuna mamaki.
He has nothing.	Ba shi da komai.
It's a game for them.	Wasa ce a gare su.
We are here today.	A nan ne muke a yau.
It is still unacceptable.	Har yanzu ba a iya yarda da shi.
There is not much there.	Babu wani abu da yawa a can.
And without that.	Kuma ba tare da wannan ba.
She doesn't like you.	Ba ta son ka.
At the weekend there are a few.	A karshen mako akwai 'yan kaɗan.
You hear.	Kuna ji .
As shown above.	Kamar yadda aka nuna a sama.
I don’t want this to be just anyone.	Ba na son wannan ya zama wani kawai.
And there is nowhere to go.	Kuma babu inda za.
She knows him well.	Ta san shi sosai.
Only he knows.	Shi kadai ya sani.
She will be helped.	Za a taimaka mata.
Maybe he looked and read about it too.	Wataƙila ya duba ya karanta game da shi ma.
He went to eat.	Ya tafi cin abinci.
He filled it.	Ya cika ta.
It does a great job in cold weather too.	Yana yin babban aiki a cikin sanyi mai sanyi kuma.
I could not stop thinking about that.	Na kasa daina tunanin hakan.
However, it is a good thing to do.	Duk da haka, abu ne mai kyau a yi.
He went out.	Ya fita.
I can't really describe myself.	Ba zan iya bayyana kaina sosai ba.
Some kind of surprise surprised her.	Wani irin mamaki yayi mata.
I can not imagine what.	Ba zan iya tunanin me.
We have one more day tomorrow.	Muna da sauran kwana daya gobe.
I do not understand how I feel about myself, really.	Ban fahimci yadda nake ji da kaina ba, da gaske.
You will never succeed in it.	Ba za ku taɓa samun nasara da shi ba.
We have them exactly where we want them.	Muna da su daidai inda muke so.
I want to go out further.	Ina so in kara fita.
We grew up close to children.	Mun girma kusa da yara.
Would you please fix me?	Don Allah za a iya gyara min?
It is certainly not difficult to find it.	Lallai bai yi wahala a gano shi ba.
And from above things looked good.	Kuma daga sama abubuwa sun yi kama da kyau.
The volunteers all wanted one.	Masu aikin sa kai duk sun so daya.
I get that sometimes.	Ina samun haka wani lokaci.
It shouldn't last long.	Bai kamata ya dade ba.
Trying to be anywhere but there, with it.	Ƙoƙarin zama kowane wuri amma a can, tare da shi.
Children should not do this.	Bai kamata yara su yi hakan ba.
She met another man, she said.	Ta hadu da wani mutum, ta ce.
We are here and we have work to do.	Muna nan kuma muna da aikin da za mu yi.
He hit three times.	Ya buga sau uku.
You don't have to tell.	Ba sai ka fada ba.
Some things have changed.	Wasu abubuwa sun canza.
About my hearing.	Game da ji na.
The day I start.	Ranar da zan fara.
It goes faster, you pay more.	Yana tafiya da sauri, kuna biya ƙarin.
This is what he used to do along the way.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya kasance yana yi a hanya.
Not surprisingly.	Ba abin mamaki bane.
Nothing out there.	Babu wani abu daga wurin.
I got it all.	Na samu duka.
It is a country house.	Gidan kasa ne.
How do you feel about it?	Yaya kuke ji game da shi?.
It's a problem.	Matsala ce.
He seems to like it.	Da alama yana son haka.
I am happy about that.	Na yi farin ciki da hakan.
I know him.	Na san shi .
Tell him exactly what.	Faɗa masa daidai abin.
So much out there.	Don haka da yawa daga can babu.
But it seems sweet.	Amma ga alama mai dadi.
So you need to show it.	Don haka kuna buƙatar nuna shi.
We will never know for sure, right now.	Ba za mu taɓa sanin tabbas ba, yanzu.
We should get used to it now.	Ya kamata mu saba da shi a yanzu.
This is a problem.	Wannan matsala ce.
There is no one in the room.	Babu kowa a dakin.
I am still working on that.	Har yanzu ina aiki akan hakan.
I'm sorry, she said.	Yi hakuri, ta ce.
He was looking for everyone.	Ya kasance yana neman kowa.
Find out what is happening in the world today.	Gano abin da ke faruwa a duniya a yau.
It is simply the best.	Shi ne kawai mafi kyau.
The movie was made.	An yi fim.
Do not come back.	Kar ku dawo.
They don’t even have to work right.	Ba ma dole ne su yi aiki daidai ba.
I want to see you outside and around.	Ina son ganin ku waje da kusa.
All good so far.	Duk mai kyau ya zuwa yanzu.
We can not be.	Ba za mu iya zama ba.
It is made of metal.	Karfe mutum ne ke yin shi.
Go ahead now, you all.	Ci gaba yanzu, ku duka.
But we will run there down to the ground.	Amma za mu gudu a can zuwa kasa.
Of course it worked.	Tabbas yayi aiki.
I just work here.	Ina aiki a nan kawai.
What a beautiful car.	Me kyau mota.
I apologize to you.	Na yi hakuri da ku.
But why do you do that?	Amma me yasa kuke yin haka?
To go to work.	Don zuwa aiki.
You may make a mistake.	Kuna iya samun kuskure.
I want to fight	Ina so in yi fada
Be like water.	Zama kamar ruwa.
She drank heavily.	Ta sha sha sosai.
We hope to make money from this.	Muna fatan samun kuɗi daga wannan.
Take a light dinner.	Ɗauki abincin dare mai sauƙi.
I'm sure you know him.	Na tabbata kun san shi.
I did not know you were here, in the house.	Ban san kana nan ba, a gidan.
Everything that happened the previous day happened again.	Duk abin da ya faru a ranar da ta gabata ya sake faruwa.
And hopefully not next.	Kuma da fatan ba na gaba ba.
Just do whatever you want to do.	Kawai yi duk abin da kuke son yi.
He wanted to make sure this did not happen again.	Ya so ya tabbatar hakan bai sake faruwa ba.
The seeker of truth does not seek anything.	Mai neman gaskiya ba ya neman wani abu.
He wanted to think more.	Ya so ya kara yin tunani.
He would not talk about it.	Ba zai yi magana a kai ba.
After that, the plane took off quickly.	Bayan haka, jirgin ya tashi da sauri.
Do not leave her alone.	Kada a bar ta ita kadai.
We need to know who we really are.	Muna bukatar mu san ko wanene mu da gaske.
The car is there.	Motar tana can.
He is a man, or close to him.	Mutum ne, ko kusa da shi.
But it will do you no good.	Amma ba zai yi muku komai ba.
I found it very interesting.	Na sami abin ban sha'awa sosai.
Then the time came.	Sai lokacin ya zo.
Do not take the fight.	Kar a dauki fada.
Let us not be afraid.	Kada mu ji tsoro.
She was ready to go.	Ta shirya ta tafi.
What we do not understand we are afraid of.	Abin da ba mu gane ba mu kan ji tsoro.
He could not sleep.	Ya kasa barci .
But something went wrong somewhere.	Amma wani abu ya yi kuskure a wani wuri.
It was something.	Ya kasance wani abu.
Really great home.	A gaske babban gida.
They are not alone.	Ba su kadai ba.
Because it is.	Don shi ne.
Her eyes widened.	Kallon ta yayi.
They all say, you know.	Duk suna cewa, ka sani.
She seems to understand exactly what is going on.	Da alama ta fahimci ainihin abin da ke faruwa.
I think you will want to know.	Ina tsammanin za ku so ku sani.
No one is eating now.	Babu wanda ke cin abinci yanzu.
It's a bedroom.	Dakin kwana ne.
People have found that money is very useful.	Mutane sun gano cewa kudi yana da amfani sosai.
The dress is very well made, it is beautiful.	Rigar da aka yi sosai, tana da kyau.
They are arrested.	Ana kama su.
The meal was prepared.	An shirya abincin.
Today no one recognizes him.	Yau babu wanda ya gane shi.
This song can be read in any way.	Ana iya karanta wannan waƙa ta kowace hanya.
But sometimes one has to do it.	Amma wani lokacin dole ne mutum ya yi.
I feel like he does.	Ina jin kamar yana yi.
I think it’s happening around me.	Ina ganin yana faruwa a kusa da ni.
There is no right or wrong here.	Babu daidai ko kuskure a nan.
He did not hear a word.	Bai ji wata magana ba.
How about that.	Yaya game da hakan.
As always, it's about money.	Kamar yadda aka saba, game da kudi ne.
The work is difficult.	Aikin yana da wahala.
They know how to use it.	Sun san yadda ake amfani da shi.
I just play at home, I play in real life.	Ina wasa gida kawai, ina wasa a rayuwa ta gaske.
He thought carefully.	Ya yi tunani a hankali.
It's a good call.	Kira ne mai kyau.
I'm working on it.	Ina aiki a kai.
He is in the house.	Yana cikin gidan.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a bayyana kan hakan ba.
He didn't care if she finished.	Bai damu ba ko ta gama.
Maybe we’ll get it, once at a time.	Wataƙila za mu samu, sau ɗaya a lokaci guda.
As the sun turns into night.	Kamar yadda rana ta koma dare.
In spite of everything, she wanted to be found.	Duk da komai, ta so a samu.
But there is more to it than that.	Amma akwai babban abu fiye da shi.
You have to do your best.	Dole ne ku yi mafi kyau.
I can make another, or just use this.	Zan iya yin wani, ko kawai amfani da wannan.
He put on his shirt before leaving.	Ya saka riga kafin ya fita.
Now she knows it won't happen.	Yanzu ta san hakan ba zai faru ba.
Or maybe some people don’t see that.	Ko watakila wasu mutane ba sa ganin haka.
I will publish it below.	Zan buga shi a kasa.
It takes longer than you think.	Yana ɗaukar lokaci fiye da yadda kuke tunani.
But nothing is normal in any way.	Amma babu abin da aka saba ta kowace hanya.
Just here and go.	Kawai nan kuma tafi.
They know him well and love him.	Sun san shi sosai kuma suna son shi.
I can't really speak right now.	Ba zan iya magana da gaske ba yanzu.
We were not able to talk to him.	Ba mu sami damar yin magana da shi ba.
No one asked me.	Babu wanda ya tambaye ni.
I knew she would never stop.	Na san ba za ta daina ba.
Maybe it's true.	Wataƙila yana da gaskiya.
I did not know she was married.	Ban san ta yi aure ba.
He touched her.	Ya taba ta.
We should or should not do it.	Ya kamata mu yi ko ba za mu yi ba.
I don't want to hear.	Bana son ji.
I have no problem with that.	Bani da matsala da wannan.
It's just something.	Wani abu ne kawai.
Slowly he opened the car door.	A hankali ya bude kofar motar.
It is not fair to whom we may encounter.	Ba daidai ba ne ga wanda za mu iya ci karo da shi.
Boy, did you do well with that.	Yaro, ka yi kyau da hakan.
She told him.	Ta gaya masa.
Watch as you like.	Kalli yadda kuke so.
Nothing for you here.	Babu komai a gare ku a nan.
He is the one we are.	Shi ne wanda mu.
Maybe a few here and there.	Wataƙila wasu kaɗan nan da can.
And you were amazing.	Kuma kun kasance abin ban mamaki.
The problem is you say.	Matsalar ku ce.
I get up early every day.	Ina tashi da wuri kowace rana.
I'm not happy.	Ban yi farin ciki ba.
In the end we are on to something.	A ƙarshe muna kan wani abu.
He knew what was happening and did nothing.	Ya san abin da ke faruwa bai yi komai ba.
Bring me back to life.	Ka dawo da ni rai .
I know there.	Na san akwai.
I knew he would never come back.	Na san ba zai dawo ba.
Look around you.	Kalli a kusa da ku.
There is only one sign, but he sees three.	Alama ɗaya ce kawai, amma yana ganin uku.
I always.	Ni kullum .
And after we were together for a year, it happened.	Kuma bayan mun kasance tare shekara guda, abin ya faru.
No one really knows.	Babu wanda ya sani da gaske.
I love you as much as you do.	Ina son ku kamar yadda kuke.
You think you’re going to be something great.	Kuna tsammanin za ku zama wani abu mai girma.
You will love them very much.	Za ku so su sosai.
I stopped a little bit.	Na tsaya kadan kadan.
You must know.	Dole ne ku sani.
But it’s something for me.	Amma yana da wani abu nawa.
Without me, you have nothing.	Ba tare da ni ba, ba ku da komai.
But when he works it is fun.	Amma lokacin da yake aiki yana da daɗi.
Hope to be here.	Da fatan za a kasance a nan.
For curiosity, you know.	Don son sani, kun sani.
I can't answer this.	Ba zan iya amsa wannan ba.
He was so, so he still sometimes puts people ahead.	Ya kasance haka, don haka har yanzu wani lokacin yana sanya mutane a gaba.
These are not like that.	Waɗannan ba irin wannan ba ne.
It does not belong to you.	Ba na ku ba ne.
Let's get in the car.	Mu shiga mota.
You did it.	Kai ne ka yi haka.
We can totally do this !.	Za mu iya gaba ɗaya yin wannan!.
He is the best skin.	Shi ne mafi kyawun fata.
To change the way we think.	Don canza yadda muke tunani.
And nothing.	Kuma babu komai.
My print is not even on it.	Buga na ba ma a kai.
He had never seen one.	Bai taba ganin daya ba.
We were surprised by this.	Mun yi mamakin wannan.
Whether she likes it or not.	Ko ta so ko ba ta so.
You met this person.	Kun hadu da wannan mutumin.
It is raining now.	An fara ruwan sama a yanzu.
He did not like uncertainty.	Bai son rashin tabbas.
To me they were the best.	A gare ni sun kasance mafi kyau.
Look, you came out with me one day.	Duba, kun fito tare da ni wata rana.
Please come early.	Da fatan za ku zo da wuri.
We tried everything until we found something that just felt right.	Mun gwada komai har sai mun sami wani abu wanda kawai ya ji daidai.
I got mine.	Na samu nawa.
I have to keep that in mind next time.	Dole ne in tuna da hakan a karo na gaba.
It took her a year before she really became alive.	Sai da ta yi shekara guda kafin ta zama mai rai da gaske.
But he was wrong.	Amma yayi kuskure.
Knowledge has changed.	An canza sani.
You get your chance and you lose it.	Kun sami damar ku kuma kun rasa shi.
I remember it from school, of course.	Ina tuna shi daga makaranta, ba shakka.
This is not the purpose of the ceremony.	Wannan ba dalilin bikin ba ne.
Almost time to travel.	Kusan lokacin tafiya.
This is completely false.	Wannan gaba daya karya ne.
Three years of hard work, why?	Tsawon shekaru uku na wahala, don me?
Both in our equipment and locally.	Duka a cikin kayan aikin mu da na gida.
He knew something.	Ya san wani abu.
But this too cannot be true.	Amma wannan ma ba zai iya zama daidai ba.
I want to do something amazing.	Ina so in yi wani abu mai ban mamaki.
This is one way of getting to know you better.	Wannan hanya ɗaya ce ta sanin ku da kyau.
I knew that would never happen.	Na san hakan ba zai faru ba.
Certainly not new.	Babu shakka ba sabon abu ba ne.
I don't want to hear.	Bana son ji.
I can't be like them.	Ba zan iya zama kamar su ba.
So for me it was the other way around.	Don haka a gare ni ita ce sauran hanyar.
She has the job she wants.	Tana da aikin da take so.
I haven’t missed anything coming, see.	Ban rasa wani abu da ke zuwa ba, gani.
What the doctor said.	Abin da likitan ya ce.
He did everything we needed to do.	Ya yi duk abin da muke bukata ya yi.
For now.	A yanzu.
But that is the case.	Amma haka abin ya kasance.
This is not a good statement.	Wannan ba magana ce mai kyau ba.
Something would go wrong without them.	Wani abu zai yi kuskure ba tare da su ba.
I have to do it on my own.	Dole ne in yi haka a kaina.
Obviously, you will make a mistake.	Babu shakka, za ku sami kuskure.
It should be done.	Ya kamata a yi.
I can't tell anyone.	Ba zan iya gaya wa kowa ba.
Maybe he'll kill him.	Wataƙila zai kashe shi.
Getting on hand for a month.	Samun isa a hannu har tsawon wata guda.
From there she ran.	Daga can ta gudu.
I know it's not a real correction.	Na san ba gyara bane na gaske.
It is being restored today.	Ana sake dawo da shi yau.
That's why he sat alone, he thought.	Shi ya sa ya zauna shi kadai, ya yi tunani.
In the end this became a big deal.	A ƙarshe wannan ya zama babban abu sosai.
Now you will be.	Yanzu za ku kasance.
But suppose you just turned on the water.	Amma a ce kun kunna ruwan kawai.
No, not for us.	A'a, ba don mu ba.
I recommend removing it altogether.	Ina ba da shawarar cire shi gaba ɗaya.
This is not a job.	Wannan ba aiki ba ne.
We can do whatever we want here.	Za mu iya yin duk abin da muke so a nan.
And it is enough.	Kuma ya isa.
Not more than one.	Bai fi ɗaya ba.
They will run again.	Za su sake gudu.
He loves me and wants to marry me.	Ya so ni kuma yana so ya aure ni.
Like real life.	Kamar rayuwa ta gaske.
Either way, they were a problem.	Wata hanya ko ɗaya, sun kasance matsala.
However, that was before.	Duk da haka, a baya kenan.
What? 	Menene?
when we lost the car.	lokacin da muka rasa motar.
She knew what she was doing.	Ta san me take yi.
I never came to ask you.	Ban taba zuwa na tambaye ka ba.
He was very interesting and interesting.	Ya kasance mai ban sha'awa da ban sha'awa.
I need a sweet coffee in the morning.	Ina bukata kofi na mai dadi da safe.
Some may take it or leave it.	Wasu suna iya ɗauka ko barin shi.
However, it is not a problem.	Duk da haka, ba shi da matsala.
That is very interesting.	Hakan yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
Nor has such a house ever been heard of.	Haka kuma ba a taba jin irin wannan gidan ba.
Nothing really came up.	Babu wani abu da ya fito da gaske.
That is why they have brought you here.	Shi ya sa suka sa ka zo nan.
I can say that.	Zan iya cewa.
But it is.	Amma yana da.
What he needs.	Abin da yake bukata.
Keep up the good work you are doing.	Ci gaba da kyakkyawan aikin da kuke yi.
Which is wrong.	Wanda ba daidai ba ne.
Which is a great reason to work with other women.	Wanda shine babban dalilin yin aiki tare da wasu mata.
Above it, but not much.	Sama da ita, amma ba da yawa ba.
The water is coming.	Ruwan yana zuwa.
There is still a lot to discover.	Akwai da yawa har yanzu a gano.
It may still happen one day.	Yana iya har yanzu faruwa wata rana.
Today is gone.	Yau an tafi.
I looked at myself.	Na duba da kaina.
Write something new, write something interesting.	Rubuta sabon abu, rubuta wani abu mai ban sha'awa.
I gave her everything.	Na ba ta komai.
There is no time to explain anything.	Babu lokacin bayyana komai.
No one knows you.	Babu wanda ya san ku.
Or the first day at work.	Ko rana ta farko a wurin aiki.
I think this article can be useful for you.	Ina tsammanin wannan labarin zai iya zama da amfani a gare ku.
But she failed to be right.	Amma ta kasa zama daidai.
You do not often hear this.	Ba ka yawan jin labarin wannan.
But this is nothing new.	Amma wannan ba sabon abu bane.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
I paid you	na biya ku
Where did she come from?	Daga ina ta fito?
Yet the next ones do.	Duk da haka masu zuwa suna yi.
This is completely unhealthy.	Wannan ba shi da lafiya gaba daya.
I do not need to drink	Bana bukatar in sha
It's a difficult thing.	Abu ne mai wahala.
There is no way out.	Babu hanyar fita.
This is a problem.	Wannan matsala ce.
This will be a difficult task.	Wannan zai zama aiki mai wahala.
I can't change the past.	Ba zan iya canza abin da ya gabata ba.
Desire should be the problem, not fear.	So ya kamata ya zama matsalar, ba tsoro ba.
They work day and night on this.	Suna aiki ba dare ba rana akan wannan.
Some she understood, but many she did not.	Wasu ta gane, amma da yawa ba ta yi ba.
Now she understands.	Yanzu ta gane.
Cannot be used.	Ba za a iya amfani da shi ba.
He hopes it is stopped.	Ya yi fatan an daina.
For many years.	Shekaru da yawa.
It's true.	Gaskiya ne.
And this house.	Kuma wannan gidan.
In fact, this often happens.	A gaskiya, hakan yana faruwa sau da yawa.
Some are suffering today.	Wasu suna shan wahala a yau.
I want more.	Ina son ƙarin.
Think back.	Ka yi tunani a baya.
I already understand what you said.	Na riga na gane abin da kuka ce.
Now she sees the truth.	Yanzu ta ga gaskiya.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
You can get up now.	Kuna iya tashi yanzu.
He could not let this pass.	Ya kasa barin wannan ya wuce.
Even in the end, you said nothing.	Ko a ƙarshe, ba ku ce komai ba.
The time has come, or the time has passed.	Lokaci ya yi, ko kuma lokacin da ya wuce.
And he caught.	Kuma ya kama.
He always has time to help others.	A koyaushe yana da lokacin taimaka wa wasu.
Apparently everyone is talking about time.	Da alama kowa yana magana akan lokacin.
From there they take.	Daga nan suke dauka.
You cry so much it comes out.	Kuka yayi sosai yana fita.
The real world went into it.	Duniya ta gaske ta shiga ciki.
He seems to want to be me, but better.	Da alama yana so ya zama ni, amma mafi kyau.
It looks good on me.	Yayi min kyau.
He went out to work.	Ya fita aiki.
Maybe we will do without arrest.	Wataƙila za mu yi ba tare da kama mu ba.
This is not, of course, what happened.	Wannan ba, ba shakka, abin da ya faru ba ne.
I did not hear you.	Ban ji ku ba.
I want to know what is going on.	Ina so in san abin da ke faruwa.
He will go through this later, when he is on his own.	Zai wuce wannan daga baya, lokacin da yake kan kansa.
So if you need more work.	Don haka idan kuna buƙatar ƙarin aiki.
Some were prepared, some came as a surprise.	Wasu an shirya, wasu sun zo da mamaki.
Not true.	Ba gaskiya bane.
Everything is available.	Duk abubuwan da ke akwai.
How are you?	Kuna lafiya?
No one left early.	Babu wanda ya fita da wuri.
They made no mistake.	Ba su yi kuskure ba.
I hope to do it again for sure.	Ina fatan in sake yin hakan tabbas.
Just stay that way.	Kawai tsaya haka.
Or not enough.	Ko bai isa ba.
It's almost two or three now.	Ya kusan sau biyu ko uku yanzu.
If it does, we don't need to do anything.	Idan ya yi, ba ma bukatar mu yi komai.
You really like the game.	Kuna son wasan sosai.
But that is not what happened.	Amma ba abin da ya faru ba kenan.
Sometimes, it’s not so good.	Wani lokaci, ba shi da kyau sosai.
The program you wrote is incorrect.	Shirin da kuka rubuta ba daidai bane.
We just play.	Muna wasa kawai.
I can't miss it.	Ba zan iya rasa ba.
They must be expected to do so.	Dole ne a yi tsammanin za su yi haka.
It cannot be removed.	Ba za a iya cire shi ba.
I have a lot of time for her.	Ina da lokaci mai yawa gare ta.
Only yesterday she came back.	Jiya kawai ta dawo.
I can catch you too.	Zan iya kama ku ma.
So,.	Don haka, .
But he was wrong.	Amma yayi kuskure.
There is something about that.	Akwai wani abu game da hakan.
What's closest.	Menene mafi kusa da.
So, we're done.	Don haka, mun gama.
They kept running.	Suka ci gaba da gudu.
We will find out what must be done.	Za mu gano abin da dole ne a yi.
Let's do the same.	Bari irin wannan kuma.
We are smart.	Muna da hankali.
Remember, you have a job to do.	Ka tuna, kana da aikin da za ka yi.
There is so much here to admire.	Akwai da yawa a nan don sha'awar shi.
Someone is not right for her.	Wani ba ya mata daidai.
He’s making a good effort.	Yana yin ƙoƙari mai kyau.
I'm not saying you are, of course.	Ba na cewa kai ne, ba shakka.
Until last night.	Sai a daren jiya.
I want to do something, be someone else.	Ina so in yi wani abu, zama wani.
You better come too.	Gara ka zo ma.
But not now.	Amma ba yanzu.
They will get nothing out of it.	Ba za su samu komai daga gare ta ba.
His shirt is off.	Rigar sa ya tafi.
And man, whether we know we need each other.	Kuma mutum, ko mun san muna bukatar juna.
We are the best.	Mu ne mafi kyau.
Sometimes he traveled for a week, rarely more than two.	Wani lokaci ya yi tafiya har tsawon mako guda, da wuya fiye da biyu.
Departure time.	Lokacin tashi.
They have it all.	Suna da duka.
We need to do that.	Muna bukatar yin hakan.
But no, it is not.	Amma a'a, ba shi ba ne.
She was right.	Ta yi daidai.
I don't have to say anything.	Ba sai na ce komai ba.
They are coming after us.	Suna zuwa bayan mu.
It does not seem to be true.	Da alama ba gaskiya bane.
But he did the right thing.	Amma abin da ya dace ya yi.
As it were.	Kamar yadda ya kasance.
You are home.	Kai ni gida.
So far nothing has worked.	Ya zuwa yanzu babu abin da ke aiki.
The time will come when you will have to get up.	Lokaci zai zo da dole ne ku tashi.
Women get these feelings, too, sometimes.	Mata suna samun waɗannan ji, kuma, wani lokacin.
They keep running.	Suna ci gaba da gudu.
But no one won.	Amma babu wanda ya ci nasara.
How can we stop fighting?	Ta yaya za mu daina fada?
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.	Babu wanda ya san abin da zai faru gobe.
Because of many things.	Saboda abubuwa da yawa.
It will be.	Zai kasance.
Maybe they were right.	Wataƙila sun yi gaskiya.
It has been so for over a year.	Ya kasance haka sama da shekara guda.
I want to know how and why and when.	Ina so in san yadda da dalilin da kuma lokacin.
And no, it is not.	Kuma a'a, ba haka ba ne.
But this is the first.	Amma wannan shi ne na farko.
Maybe there.	Wataƙila akwai.
And on his own.	Kuma a kan kansa.
We can not, he said laughing.	Ba za mu iya ba, ya ce yana dariya.
I want to know how best to do this.	Ina so in san yadda mafi kyawun yin wannan.
Probably not the most accurate name.	Wataƙila ba shine mafi daidai suna ba.
Or to put it another way.	Ko kuma ba a so a ce.
We want this to succeed.	Muna son wannan ya yi nasara.
However, it is amazing for a newcomer like me.	Duk da haka, yana da ban mamaki ga sabon sabon kamar ni.
He will do what is right.	Zai yi abin da yake daidai.
It will be something for you to inherit one day too.	Zai zama wani abu a gare ku ku gaji wata rana ma.
He would never do it.	Ba zai taba yi ba.
And why do people do that.	Kuma me yasa mutane suke yin hakan.
Not much, though.	Ba da yawa ba, duk da haka.
Go out and kill her.	Ka fita, ka kashe ta.
We are still busy.	Har yanzu muna kan aiki.
In this way, the.	Ta wannan hanyar, da.
I have heard this story before.	Na ji wannan labarin a baya.
No one opposed me.	Babu wanda ya saba min.
So I will know that you are a real person.	Don haka zan san cewa tabbas kai mutum ne na gaske.
He needs to protect them.	Yana bukatar ya kare su.
For a moment, she could not see anything.	Na d'an lokaci, ba ta iya ganin komai ba.
I am leaving in the morning.	Zan tafi da safe.
We don't even have that.	Ba ma da wannan.
But it will take some time.	Amma zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci.
I didn’t do it right on my own.	Ban yi daidai a kaina ba.
He wants to see you.	Yana son ganin ka.
This can happen to me.	Wannan zai iya faruwa da ni.
Definitely not for you.	Babu shakka ba gare ku ba.
He has a son of his own.	Yana da ɗan kansa.
You have been changed.	An canza ku.
Better and better.	Mafi kyau kuma mafi kyau.
She added.	Ta kara fada.
Hardly, but they did it.	Da wahala, amma sun yi shi.
But it was not a difficult task for me.	Amma ba aiki mai wahala ba ne a gare ni.
I think we should have seen it coming.	Ina tsammanin da mun ga yana zuwa.
He still hasn't spoken.	Har yanzu bai yi magana ba.
We will stay with you, both of us.	Za mu zauna tare da ku, mu biyu.
I'm sure it will.	Na tabbata zai yi.
So you know it's the best.	Haka ka san shi ne mafi kyau.
Please get out of this.	Don Allah ku fito daga wannan.
I know we need to leave you.	Na san muna bukatar mu bar ku.
Please sign your name.	Da fatan za a sanya hannu a sunan ku.
That ended quickly.	Hakan ya kare da sauri.
Probably so.	Wataƙila haka ne.
They will tell me that this can happen to anyone.	Za su gaya mani cewa hakan na iya faruwa ga kowa.
Many people tried to reach him.	Mutane da yawa sun yi ƙoƙarin isa gare shi.
If this happens once, it may happen again.	Idan wannan ya faru sau ɗaya, watakila yana iya sake faruwa.
He took it all.	Ya dauka duka.
See how he plays this year.	Kalli yadda yake wasa bana.
I love money anyway.	Ina son kudi ta kowace hanya.
He does not make mistakes.	Ba ya yin kuskure.
He drank two cups of coffee.	Ya sha kofi biyu na kofi.
Then I told her.	Sai na gaya mata.
Or leave again.	Ko barin sake.
It bothers me a little.	Yana ɗan bata mini rai.
We must find the right person for the job.	Dole ne mu sami mutumin da zai dace da wannan bukata.
They keep saying that.	Suka ci gaba da cewa.
I really know where they are.	Lallai na san inda suke.
Not at the same time, though.	Ba a lokaci guda ba, ko da yake.
Time does not work as you think.	Lokaci baya aiki yadda kuke tunani.
So do we.	Mu kuma haka muke.
I left the water where it was.	Na bar ruwan a inda yake.
And no one is making them change.	Kuma babu wanda ya sa su canza.
But you can do something about it.	Amma kuna iya yin abubuwa game da hakan.
And who is the child.	Kuma wane yaro ne.
Now, she does.	Yanzu, ta yi.
Amazing songbook.	Abin ban mamaki littafin waƙa.
Or better yet is not sitting still.	Ko mafi kyau shine rashin zama.
We will play the game again.	Za mu sake buga wasan waje.
This is a great frustration.	Wannan babban rashin jin daɗi ne.
You can be anything else.	Kuna iya zama wani abu kuma.
This is a necklace.	Wannan abin wuya ne.
They are looking for something new.	Suna neman sabon abu.
If you need anything, call me.	Idan kuna buƙatar wani abu, ku kira ni.
I understand this feeling completely.	Na fahimci wannan jin gaba ɗaya.
You had a bad day.	Kun yi mummunan rana.
Talking to him is like talking to someone.	Magana da shi kamar magana ne da wani.
You need to answer me.	Kuna buƙatar amsa mani.
They can't touch you here.	Ba za su iya taɓa ku a nan ba.
That's why we stopped.	Shi ya sa muka tsaya.
Good night.	Muka kwana.
He is not happy.	Shi ba mai farin ciki ba ne.
But they need more sleep.	Amma sun fi buƙatar barci.
You're just looking for more work.	Kuna nan kawai kuna neman ƙarin aiki.
We may never know.	Wataƙila ba za mu taɓa sani ba.
Very good !.	Yayi kyau sosai!.
Of course, every month.	Tabbas, kowane wata.
Don’t worry about it, though.	Kada ku damu da shi, ko da yake.
I'm not sure if this will help you.	Ban tabbata ko wannan zai taimaka muku ba.
I planned all this.	Na shirya wannan duka.
Sometimes they never really told anyone.	Wani lokaci ba su taɓa gaya wa kowa da gaske ba.
Their real name will come later.	Sunan su na gaske zai zo daga baya.
He did not agree.	Bai yarda ba.
I could not find it.	Na kasa samu.
It did a lot of people.	Ya yi mutane da yawa.
I did it myself.	Ni da kaina na yi.
No one is in the waiting room.	Babu kowa a dakin jira.
They said they failed.	In ji su kasa kasa.
They know people will buy.	Sun san mutane za su saya.
It helped me sleep.	Ya taimake ni barci.
I give them.	Ina ba su.
They like heat.	Suna son zafi.
And it's funny.	Kuma tana da ban dariya.
I like mine	Ina son nawa
I think that's a statement.	Ina tsammanin wannan magana ce.
And now we no longer look for them.	Kuma yanzu ba mu kara neman su ba.
I do not really agree with that.	Ba na yarda da hakan sosai.
Do it the same time.	Yi daidai wannan lokacin.
We started talking.	Muka fara magana.
He tried to learn not to worry, but with some success.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya koyi kada ya damu, amma da ɗan nasara.
He wanted to get out of the house again.	Ya so ya sake fita daga gidan.
Like, every day.	Kamar, kowace rana.
I drink water	Ina sha ruwa
We agreed not to go.	Mun yarda kada mu tafi.
I stood my ground.	Na tsaya akan tunani na.
It is still in progress.	Har yanzu ana ci gaba.
I suggest you turn on what you want to turn on.	Ina ba da shawarar ku kunna abin da kuke so ku kunna.
And he didn't even remember anything.	Kuma bai ma tuna da komai ba.
He should have looked at them earlier.	Ya kamata ya duba su a baya.
And to see them.	Kuma don ganin su.
I forgot the rest.	Na manta sauran.
Nothing to laugh about.	Babu abin dariya.
At last! 	Karshen ta!
But we must.	Amma dole ne mu.
I do not know what.	Ban san menene ba.
It is one thing.	Abu daya ne.
They wanted to kill me too.	Sun so su kashe ni ma.
They got married early and happily.	Sun yi aure da wuri da farin ciki.
Not sure where it went wrong.	Ban tabbata inda ba daidai ba.
You told us so.	Kun gaya mana haka.
It is not enough to die.	Bai isa ya mutu ba.
No one has touched where you want it.	Babu wanda ya taɓa inda kuke so shi.
We did not.	Ba mu yi ba.
I know the truth.	Na san gaskiya.
This was easy and fast to do.	Wannan ya kasance mai sauƙi da sauri don yin.
Hopefully this will be done by yourself next time.	Da fatan za a yi hakan da kanku lokaci na gaba.
There is no reason to smoke.	Babu dalilin shan taba.
Tell us when to come.	Fada mana lokacin zuwa.
He will spend a lot of money on himself.	Zai kashe wa kansa kudi masu yawa.
The food is over.	Abincin ya kare.
I gave her everything.	Na ba ta komai.
There was just something about her that didn’t come true.	Akwai kawai wani abu game da ita wanda bai zo gaskiya ba.
No, lying is not so good.	A'a, karya ba ta da kyau sosai.
Go and have a good cup of coffee.	Ku je ku sha kofi mai kyau.
After that he passed somewhere.	Bayan haka ya wuce wani wuri.
No one has ever done it.	Babu wanda ya taba yi.
Less for homework.	Kadan don aikin gida.
I got mine today.	Na samu nawa yau.
You seem to have gotten really good.	Da alama kun sami ainihin mai kyau.
I hope he is right.	Ina fatan ya yi gaskiya.
This cannot be taken lightly.	Wannan ba za a iya ɗauka da wasa ba.
And leave me to myself.	Kuma ka bar ni ga kaina.
We are here now.	Yanzu muna nan.
Not so close.	Ba haka ya yi kusa ba.
But no, sorry, not a fan.	Amma a'a, hakuri, ba mai sha'awar ba.
If they like me.	Idan sun so ni.
You have to make it look like that.	Dole ne ku sanya shi ya ga haka.
You must be tired.	Dole ne ku gaji.
He is tired.	Ya gaji.
I like to work near home.	Ina son yin aiki a kusa da gida.
I agree with that.	Na yarda da haka.
Talk about it and use common sense.	Yi magana da amfani da hankali da ita.
You need to do two more things.	Kuna buƙatar ƙarin yin abubuwa biyu.
Now, it was time to prepare.	Yanzu, ya kasance lokacin da aka shirya.
This is something you should do immediately.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya kamata ku yi nan da nan.
They do not know that we are coming to them.	Ba su san muna zuwa gare su ba.
Maybe we need help now.	Wataƙila muna buƙatar taimako yanzu.
So amazing here.	Don haka ban mamaki a nan.
Life is not perfect.	Rayuwa ba ta yi daidai ba.
He called again.	Ya sake kira.
I do not know you.	Ban san ku ba.
That idea is not useful right now, however.	Tunanin hakan bai kasance da amfani ba a yanzu, duk da haka.
This thing is useless!	Wannan abu ba shi da amfani!
And how, in the end, they got married and failed.	Kuma ta yaya, a ƙarshe, sun yi aure kuma sun kasa.
And it is still being published.	Kuma har yanzu ana buga shi.
If we had lost that, we would have been in trouble.	Idan muka rasa hakan, da mun shiga cikin wahala.
You understand things.	Kuna gane abubuwa.
There is no seating.	Babu wurin zama.
I will not stand for him.	Ba zan tsaya gare shi ba.
Here is the reason.	Ga dalilin.
We knew we could get cold somewhere.	Mun san za mu iya yin sanyi a wani wuri.
Otherwise you will have to walk or wait.	In ba haka ba za ku yi tafiya ko ku jira.
It is two o'clock in the morning.	An rufe karfe biyu na safe.
Not for me alone.	Ba don ni kadai ba.
And now this.	Kuma yanzu wannan.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Babu wani abu da ya dace.
I knew then.	Na sani a lokacin.
I did not find the article.	Ban sami labarin ba.
Not surprisingly.	Ba abin mamaki ba ne.
Two things in it.	Abubuwa biyu a ciki.
Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh!	Magana yayi zafi.
I ate in one go.	Na abinci a cikin tafiya daya.
This is your recommendation.	Wannan shine shawarar ku.
I know he can.	Na san zai iya.
Like the others.	Kamar yadda sauran suke.
It looks bigger.	Ga alama mafi girma.
It just doesn't work that way.	Kawai baya aiki haka.
But you can do them.	Amma kuna iya yin su.
I knew it would be so.	Na san zai kasance haka.
I will do things from here onwards.	Zan yi abubuwa daga nan daga yanzu.
I do not want and I will leave you.	Ba na so kuma zan bar ku.
We caught a lot of fish.	Mun kama kifi da yawa.
And so it was in the plan.	Kuma haka abin ya kasance a cikin shirin.
Yet they did more than that.	Amma duk da haka sun yi fiye da haka.
I could not imagine living without him.	Ba zan iya tunanin rayuwa ba tare da shi ba.
God knows what someone is called.	Allah ya san abin da ake kira wani.
Maybe more than that.	Wataƙila ya fi wannan hanyar.
You are safe now.	Kuna lafiya yanzu.
I'm close.	Ina kusa.
We ate outside.	Muka ci a waje.
You should do one.	Ya kamata ku yi daya.
The world should know exactly what is going on.	Ya kamata duniya ta san ainihin abin da ke faruwa.
She was able to go where she wanted.	Ta samu damar tafiya inda take so.
I do not understand the room.	Ban gane dakin ba.
No one can do it.	Babu wanda zai iya yi.
We still need your help.	Har yanzu muna bukatar taimakon ku.
It was simple, but good.	Ya kasance mai sauƙi, amma mai kyau.
I'm sure he'll be fine.	Na tabbata zai samu lafiya.
I feel like he is playing and everything is fine.	Ina jin yana wasa kuma komai yana lafiya.
I will explain it tomorrow.	Zan bayyana shi gobe.
It makes us who we are.	Yana sa mu wanda muke.
She was the only one to read.	Ita kadai ta karanta.
Now she earns a lot of money.	Yanzu ta sami kudi mai yawa.
I don't have much role model.	Ba ni da yawan abin koyi.
I love him.	Ina son shi.
God will appear.	Allah zai bayyana.
The meeting was unsuccessful.	Taron bai yi nasara ba.
I am very happy if you can help me.	Ina matukar farin ciki idan za ku iya taimaka mini.
But it is still there.	Amma har yanzu yana nan.
They are not even driving on the road anymore.	Ba su ma tuƙi a hanya kuma.
That has changed, a little bit.	Wannan ya canza, kadan.
The effort gave him success.	Ƙoƙarin ya ba shi nasara.
The flight was late, as usual.	Jirgin ya makara, kamar yadda aka saba.
If she is good.	Idan tana da kyau.
It's too cold here.	An yi sanyi sosai a nan.
But he does not say anything about it.	Amma ba ya cewa komai game da shi.
They looked at the time.	Suka kalli lokacin.
That's what we did.	Haka muka yi.
They did well.	Sun yi kyau.
The rain stopped after the meal.	Ruwan sama ya tsaya bayan cin abinci.
Without telling him anything.	Ba tare da gaya masa komai ba.
But he needed to.	Amma ya bukata.
We talked about it a lot.	Mun yi magana game da shi da yawa.
But it does not seem to work.	Amma da alama baya aiki.
I enjoyed this whole time.	Na ji daɗin wannan lokacin duka.
We sent it to him yesterday.	Mun aika masa jiya.
It just rises and fills you from within.	Sai kawai ya tashi ya cika ku daga ciki.
If she is pregnant again.	Idan ma tana da ciki kuma.
It looks good on me.	Yayi min kyau.
I decided not to give it a try.	Na yanke shawarar ba shi dama.
To do it.	Don yin shi.
He said I wanted to show him something.	Ya ce ina so in nuna mani wani abu.
This is a big mistake.	Wannan babban kuskure ne.
And there are many things.	Kuma akwai abubuwa da yawa.
You do not know your location.	Ba ku san wurin ku ba.
But they are not alone.	Amma ba su kaɗai ba ne.
He did nothing.	Bai yi komai ba.
The teacher decided to play the game would be fun.	Malamin ya yanke shawarar yin wasan zai zama mai daɗi.
But it is certainly not that difficult.	Amma da gaske ba haka yake da wahala ba.
But that was not to be.	Amma hakan bai kasance ba.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
It's time to dump her.	Lokaci yayi da za a kama.
Back there.	Koma can.
Who will not do it?	Wanene ba zai yi ba?.
Don't let this happen to you.	Kada ku bari wannan ya faru da ku.
I want to take part in the game.	Ina so in dauki hannu a wasan.
She wanted to go.	Ta so tafiya.
And good things have happened.	Kuma abubuwa masu kyau sun faru.
We hope you enjoy it !.	Muna fatan za ku ji daɗi!.
Or with me.	Ko tare da ni.
I'll try to talk to him tomorrow.	Zan gwada masa magana gobe.
Let's put it this way.	Mu sanya shi haka.
For me, it was a second job.	A gare ni, aiki na biyu ne.
He wants to marry me.	Yana son ya aure ni.
The mind plays with the mind.	Hankali yana wasa da hankali.
So you need to keep trying.	Don haka kuna buƙatar ci gaba da ƙoƙari.
You could say you know.	Da za ku iya cewa kun sani.
Take nothing.	Ɗauka ba komai ba.
I know not much.	Na san ba yawa.
You can do whatever you want with it.	Kuna iya yin abin da kuke so da ita.
I think she made a lot of mistakes.	Ina ganin ta yi kuskure da yawa.
It's no use.	Ba amfani.
Coffee never happened.	Kofi bai taba faruwa ba.
I thought it would pass.	Na dauka zai wuce.
They do not like me.	Ba su so ni.
We wanted to do this stuff.	Mun so mu yi wannan kayan.
I will prove her wrong.	Zan tabbatar mata da kuskure.
Yet at the same time kind of beautiful.	Duk da haka a lokaci guda irin kyau.
Nothing interesting happened.	Babu wani abu mai ban sha'awa da ya faru.
Drive slowly, always looking the way.	Yi tuƙi a hankali, koyaushe yana duba hanya.
I do not buy.	Ba na saya.
But he is not really interested.	Amma ba shi da sha'awar gaske.
I know nothing.	Ban san komai ba.
There is work to be done now.	Akwai aikin yi yanzu.
No one has a name.	Babu wanda yake da suna.
You will never go home.	Ba za ku taɓa zuwa gida ba.
I have a good job.	Ina da aiki mai kyau.
You have to be careful.	Dole ne ku yi hankali.
I was amazed to see how much it still needed.	Na yi mamakin ganin yadda ake bukata har yanzu.
And we need to know that.	Kuma muna bukatar mu san wannan.
Why do you have to know?	Me yasa dole ku sani?
We need to meet.	Muna bukatar mu hadu.
I talked to him.	Na yi magana da shi.
She knew a lot, and she told him little.	Ta san da yawa, kuma ta gaya masa kadan.
You can only imagine.	Kuna iya tunanin kawai.
If there is a problem, the police come quickly.	Idan akwai matsala, 'yan sanda suna zuwa da sauri.
So it is very difficult to prove everything.	Don haka yana da wuya a tabbatar da komai.
It is cold.	Shi ne mai sanyi.
Here they stop.	Nan suka tsaya.
The stomach swells.	Ciki yayi kara.
Where to go and what to look for.	Inda za ta je kuma ta yi kyau.
Here, we can see how that works.	A nan, za mu iya ganin yadda hakan ke aiki.
It can not be easy.	Ba zai iya zama da sauƙi ba.
The above works fine.	Na sama yana aiki lafiya.
He is the one who says he is.	Shine wanda yace shine.
You know they can't agree.	Kun san ba za su iya yarda ba.
Last night was the first.	Daren jiya shine na farko.
One injury was sustained during this time.	An samu rauni guda daya a wannan lokaci.
There are so many things to love.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa don so.
I will ask you to speak to them.	Zan nemi ka yi magana da su.
I don't know about that.	Ban sani ba game da hakan.
And I will never know if I will ever fall asleep again.	Kuma ba zan taba sanin ko zan sake yin barci ba.
She asked him where she grew up.	Ta tambaye shi a ina ta girma.
No one can be sure.	Babu wanda zai iya tabbata.
I also cried a lot.	Ina kuma kuka mai yawa.
They are in each other's heads.	Suna cikin kan juna.
Where we can go and stay safe.	Wurin da za mu iya zuwa mu zauna lafiya.
I can no longer confirm this work.	Ba zan iya ƙara tabbatar da wannan aikin ba.
Nothing has changed, by the way.	Ba abin da ya canza, ta hanyar.
I am working with your best.	Ina yin aiki da mafi kyawun ku.
We feel good.	Mun ji dadi.
I put that thought into it a lot.	Na sanya wannan tunani mai yawa a ciki.
You think more than that.	Kuna tsammanin fiye da haka.
The weak world does not care.	Duniya mai rauni ba ta damu ba.
He thought it would pass.	Ya dauka zai wuce.
The hot water caused the cut.	Ruwan zafi ya sa aka yanke.
Not as bad as it could be.	Ba kamar yadda zai iya zama mummunan ba.
He really didn't expect that.	Da gaske bai yi tsammanin hakan ba.
I really feel that way.	Lallai ina jin haka.
Live life.	Yi rayuwa.
It doesn't look like it.	Bai yi kama ba.
But that does not work.	Amma wannan baya aiki.
Very close.	Kusa sosai.
I will talk to them.	Zan yi magana da su.
It works for me.	Yana yi mini aiki.
But many did.	Amma da yawa sun yi.
But, it goes beyond that.	Amma, ya wuce haka.
I was happy to do that.	Na yi farin ciki da yin haka.
It helps a little.	Ya taimaka kadan.
So he knows what the game plan is.	Don haka ya san menene shirin wasan.
We can talk about something.	Za mu iya magana game da wani abu.
I do not understand what is going on.	Ban gane me ke faruwa ba.
Many people want to accept that it is so.	Mutane da yawa suna so su yarda ya kasance haka.
Honestly we do.	Gaskiya muna yi.
I have to get up though.	Dole ne in tashi ko da yake.
They stood close to the departure.	Sun tsaya kusa da tashi.
We had lunch there.	Mun samu abincin rana a can.
I am not afraid of anything.	Bana tsoron komai.
I really hope there is a way to do this.	Ina fata da gaske akwai hanyar yin wannan.
It happens, right now.	Yana faruwa, a yanzu.
I spoke to you that day.	Na yi magana da ku a ranar.
He was killed that night.	Dare aka kashe shi.
Only one hand did, right.	Hannu daya kawai ya yi, na dama.
He was one of the first there.	Ya kasance daya daga cikin na farko a wurin.
Not everyone, no one uses me.	Ba kowa, babu mai amfani da ni.
More than we have seen since the injury.	Fiye da yadda muka gani tun daga rauni.
Tell him to go.	Ka gaya masa ya tafi.
You should not go.	Bai kamata ku tafi ba.
I will kill them all.	Zan kashe su duka.
Like she cared.	Kamar ta kula.
Somehow, he left us this.	Ko ta yaya, ya bar mana wannan.
Things can get out of hand easily.	Abubuwa za su iya fita cikin sauƙi.
You are glad that you are the one who should review this book.	Kun yi farin ciki cewa kai ne wanda ya kamata ka sake duba wannan littafin.
It will kill you otherwise.	Zai kashe ka idan ba haka ba.
I'm hot together.	Na yi zafi tare.
I want to know that it will be good.	Ina so in san cewa zai yi kyau.
No time.	Ba a yi lokaci ba.
That would be fun, fun.	Wannan zai zama wasa, abin farin ciki.
I can pick things up from here.	Zan iya ɗaukar abubuwa daga nan.
He is alive for us.	Yana da rai gare mu.
With another, with another.	Da wani, da wani.
She wanted everyone to be happy.	Ta so kowa, komai ya yi farin ciki.
You may have seen only one trip now.	Wataƙila kun ga tafiya ɗaya kawai yanzu.
So you will live together.	Don haka za ku zauna tare.
He knows me very well.	Ya san ni sosai.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
It is difficult to describe this feeling.	Yana da wuya a bayyana wannan jin.
But it can be hit or lost.	Amma ana iya buga ko rasa.
They are all working now.	Duk suna aiki yanzu.
Fun.	Abin dariya.
There is no benefit to this.	Babu wani amfani ga wannan.
I don't think money has changed hands here either.	Bana jin kudi ma sun canza hannu a nan.
So maybe.	Don haka watakila.
Nor is this the only reason for criticism.	Haka kuma ba wannan ne kawai dalilin suka ba.
We are not here until we die.	Ba mu nan sai mun mutu.
Let it all cool.	Bar duk ya yi sanyi.
I want to know you better.	Ina so in san ku da kyau.
They will see that you are an intelligent person.	Za su ga kai mutum ne mai hankali.
I plan to put some in the end.	Ina shirin sanya wasu a ƙarshe.
We all tried.	Mu duka mun gwada.
And now he is planning a trip.	Yanzu kuma yana shirin tafiya.
Another thought.	Wani tunani.
I just did.	Na yi kawai.
Either way, it will happen.	Ko ta yaya, zai faru.
He could not wait.	Ya kasa jira.
He wants them to go.	Yana son su tafi.
Another three years.	Wasu shekaru uku.
It needs to happen.	Yana buƙatar faruwa.
She had time for everyone.	Ta sami lokacin kowa.
I can show you.	Zan iya nuna muku.
Save her.	Ajiye mata ita.
Yes, we still eat there, because the food is good.	Haka ne, har yanzu muna ci a can, saboda abincin yana da kyau.
First the back story.	Da farko labarin baya.
Or maybe they don’t want to.	Ko watakila ba sa so.
In another life.	A wata rayuwa.
I never heard him talk to me like that.	Ban taba jin yana min magana haka ba.
Nothing is as it was before.	Babu wani abu da ya kasance kamar yadda yake a da.
Not good.	Ba kyau.
I looked.	Na duba.
So there is progress.	Don haka akwai ci gaba.
We will see how that happens.	Za mu ga yadda hakan zai kasance.
She studied all night.	Ta yi karatu har dare.
But only if you take care of your work on me.	Amma kawai idan kun kula da aikin ku a kaina.
I need to fix myself.	Ina bukata in gyara kaina.
Life will change whether we like it or not.	Rayuwa za ta canza ko muna so ko ba a so.
He has been in it ever since.	Ya kasance a ciki tun daga lokacin.
Stay home.	Ku zauna a gida.
I'm happy to let it go.	Ina farin cikin bar shi ya ci gaba.
Probably not the last.	Wataƙila ba zai zama na ƙarshe ba.
I did not see him coming.	Ban ga yana zuwa ba.
God knows what will happen.	Allah ya san abin da zai faru.
You will not do it because you think he will be happy.	Ba za ku yi shi ba saboda kuna tunanin zai yi farin ciki.
This room is empty.	Wannan dakin babu kowa.
It's hot today.	Yana da zafi a yau.
Where should we start?	A ina ya kamata mu fara?
We eat together every day, we are very close.	Muna cin abinci tare kowace rana, mun kasance kusa sosai.
It's just amazing.	Abin mamaki ne kawai.
I left it behind.	Na bar shi a baya.
She saw nothing.	Ba ta ga komai ba.
You take the time to find out why.	Kuna ɗaukar lokaci don gano dalilin.
But she must have wondered why.	Amma tabbas ta yi mamakin dalilin.
So it was.	Haka abin ya kasance.
Not water.	Ba ruwa ba.
First time, last time.	Lokaci na farko, lokacin ƙarshe.
But that is my feeling.	Amma wannan shine ji na.
Or still.	Ko kuma har yanzu.
He would rather be proven wrong.	Zai fi son a tabbatar da shi ba daidai ba.
It's about performance.	Yana da game da yi.
I said your name.	Na ce sunan ku.
So, will you come with me?	Don haka, za ku zo tare da ni?
To do that, I came up with the following plan.	Don yin haka, na zo da shirin mai zuwa.
Everything happens so fast here.	Komai yana faruwa da sauri a nan.
The past work is still good.	Aikin da ya gabata har yanzu yana da kyau.
She's not used to it but she certainly does.	Ba ta saba ba amma tabbas ta saba.
They are made for each other.	An yi su don juna.
I really had a problem with that.	Na sami matsala sosai da hakan.
This can only be done once in the game.	Ana iya yin wannan sau ɗaya kawai a wasan.
So just close the room.	Don haka kawai a rufe dakin.
We never wanted to do that.	Ba mu taɓa son yin hakan ba.
After all, who knows?	Bayan haka, wa ya sani?.
You see it is not planned.	Ka ga ba a shirya ba.
I will read this.	Zan karanta wannan.
It’s a way of life here.	Yana da hanyar rayuwa a nan.
Do whatever you have to do.	Yi duk abin da za ku yi.
Kids love to play with toys.	Yara suna son wasa da kayan wasan yara.
Maybe you think he is really me, and maybe he is.	Wataƙila kuna tsammanin shine ainihin ni, kuma watakila haka ne.
I don't know of anyone who has actually done that.	Ban san wani da gaske ya yi haka ba.
It never rains.	Ba ya taɓa yin ruwan sama.
Not fast enough.	Ba sauri isa ba.
And they told us.	Kuma suka gaya mana.
I do not want you to worry about me.	Bana son ka damu da ni.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru ke nan.
It’s about what you do.	Game da abin da kuke yi ne.
He added it over time.	Ya kara da shi akan lokaci.
He is not very good with people.	Ba shi da kyau sosai tare da mutane.
Just me.	Ni kawai.
Later, he thought.	Daga baya, ya yi tunani.
I do not know if he is there.	Ban sani ba ko yana nan.
No one cares.	Babu wanda ya damu da hakan.
So it does with everyone.	Don haka yana yi da kowa da kowa.
It is very nice, very cool.	Yana da kyau sosai, yayi sanyi sosai.
True, but still not true.	Gaskiya, amma duk da haka ba gaskiya bane.
I have had the opportunity to travel more and I want to work from home.	Na sami damar ƙarin tafiya kuma ina son aiki daga gida.
He thought it was a joy.	Ya yi tunanin abin farin ciki ne.
But almost.	Amma kusan kusan.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba mamaki ba ne.
We do a lot of things together.	Muna yin abubuwa da yawa tare.
There are three women in the waiting room.	Mata uku ne a dakin jira.
I'm just walking.	Ina tafiya kawai.
This is a good sign.	Wannan alama ce mai kyau.
I'm used to things.	Na saba da abubuwa.
So he knew she had never lied to him.	Don haka ya san ba ta taba yi masa karya ba.
All women are pregnant.	Duk mata suna da ciki.
But nothing was found.	Amma babu abin da aka samu.
There is nothing he can do.	Babu wani abu da zai iya yi.
They need her.	Suna bukatar ta.
We want to do it.	Muna so mu yi shi.
It's hard to do that.	Da wuya ka samu yin hakan.
It's amazing to see you again.	Yana da ban mamaki sake ganin ku.
Remove from the water.	Cire daga kan ruwa.
Didn't really have time to do it though.	Ba da gaske samun lokacin yin shi ko da yake.
But something about this did not sit right with me.	Amma wani abu game da wannan bai zauna daidai da ni ba.
Leave it now.	Bar shi a yanzu.
You are tired.	Kun gaji.
That’s the good thing about that.	Wannan shine abin da ke da kyau game da wannan.
No, not much.	A'a, ba yawa.
I'm still waiting, in fact.	Har yanzu ina jira, a gaskiya.
She should definitely go to school.	Lallai yakamata ta tafi makaranta.
He didn’t seem to know it was supposed to be.	Da alama bai san cewa ya kamata ya kasance ba.
Who no one wants.	Wanda babu wanda ya so.
Here's to loving it.	Ga son shi.
There are a few things that are more fun.	Akwai 'yan abubuwan da ya fi jin daɗi.
The event will be great for kids.	Taron zai yi kyau ga yara.
You are who you are.	Kai ne wanda kai kuma ke nan.
Maybe he is sleeping.	Wataƙila yana barci.
So he goes.	Don haka yana tafiya.
It is better to sit on the boat.	Yana da kyau a zauna a kan jirgin ruwa.
This will always be you.	Wannan zai kasance koyaushe ku.
We have been looking for a house for a long time.	Mun dade muna neman gidan.
He found himself talking.	Ya sami kansa yana magana.
There is nowhere to run.	Babu inda za a gudu.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
From top to bottom.	Daga sama zuwa kasa.
Read, read, read.	Karanta, karanta, karanta.
He just didn't want to.	Bai so kawai.
Use it.	Yi amfani da shi.
But there is nothing he can do.	Amma babu abin da zai iya yi.
Or he may be worried.	Ko kuma ya damu da gaske.
This is an opportunity.	Wannan ita ce damar.
I don’t care about work, really.	Ban damu da aiki ba, da gaske.
I can find some fish.	Zan iya gano wasu kifi.
Are you in this project?	Shin kuna cikin wannan aikin?
We were not close.	Ba mu kasance kusa ba.
It looks great on me.	Yayi min kyau sosai.
This fixed the problem.	Wannan ya gyara matsalar.
Remember that one is one journey.	Ka tuna cewa ɗaya ita ce tafiya ɗaya.
She felt she had nothing, she lost.	Ta ji ba ta da komai, ta rasa.
No wonder there.	Ba mamaki can.
You will wait.	Za ku jira.
She began to run.	Ta fara gudu.
Be that as it may.	Zama haka.
Then someone else is lying.	Sai wani kuma yana karya.
We need to understand how it works.	Muna bukatar mu fahimci yadda yake aiki.
He will give everything he has.	Zai ba da duk abin da yake da shi.
However, this may not be the case.	Duk da haka, wannan ba zai iya zama daidai ba.
I agree with him.	Na yarda da shi.
I did really well and learned a lot.	Na yi kyau sosai kuma na koyi abubuwa da yawa.
I tell you the truth.	Na gaya muku gaskiya.
He's here, he's not going to go, he's there.	Yana nan, ba zai tafi ba, yana can.
Bring it.	Kawo shi.
Think of protecting yourself.	Ka yi tunanin kare ka.
It seems very useful.	Ga alama da amfani sosai.
I'm not sure if a lawsuit could be filed here.	Ban tabbata za a iya aika wata kara a nan ba.
And so it can be.	Kuma haka yana iya zama.
I still do.	Har yanzu ina yi.
We live for a while.	Muna rayuwa na ɗan lokaci.
Maybe something just left there.	Wataƙila wani abu ne kawai ya bari a wurin.
Be honest with yourself.	Tsaya gaskiya ga wanda kai.
So? 	Don haka?
But it didn’t look like it, it wasn’t right.	Amma bai yi kama da ita ba, ba daidai ba.
Not even what is outside.	Ba ma abin da ke waje ba ne.
And that would be three.	Kuma wannan zai zama uku.
There are many unknowns.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ba a san su ba.
I am just trying to be myself.	Ina ƙoƙarin zama kaina kawai.
He says a lot about them.	Ya ce da yawa game da su.
All corrections now.	Duk gyara yanzu.
But it just so happened.	Amma sai ya zama haka kawai.
But they were there more than that.	Amma sun kasance a wurin fiye da haka kawai.
He will definitely come back for more of this.	Tabbas zai dawo don ƙarin wannan.
She made a mistake.	Ta yi kuskure.
As we all know we have it.	Kamar yadda muka sani kawai muna da shi.
And they can be alone.	Kuma za su iya zama kawai kaɗai.
But we can not know for sure.	Amma ba za mu iya sanin tabbas ba.
Two things arise from this article.	Abubuwa biyu sun tashi daga wannan labarin.
Even then I saw a mistake.	Ko da hakan na ga kuskure.
I can't add.	Ba zan iya ƙara ba.
Use them or lose them.	Yi amfani da su ko rasa su.
This is not right.	Wannan bai yi daidai ba.
You can name the path whatever you want.	Kuna iya suna hanyar duk abin da kuke so.
I'm still on a little bit.	Har yanzu ina kan dan kadan.
There is a lot of work to be done here.	Akwai babban aiki da za a yi a nan.
However, we can work on that.	Duk da haka, za mu iya yin aiki a kan hakan.
Do not rejoice.	Kada ku yi farin ciki.
And they failed.	Kuma sun kasa.
The work was difficult.	Aikin ya kasance mai wahala.
Focus on the present.	Mai da hankali kan yanzu.
This is not fun at all.	Wannan ba abin jin daɗi ba ne ko kaɗan.
She doesn't remember anything or anyone.	Bata tuna komai ko kowa.
She can.	Za ta iya.
All the way out.	Duk hanyar fita.
He alleged that she was lying.	Ya yi zargin cewa karya take yi.
She could not understand why it was so late.	Ta kasa gane dalilin da yasa ya makara.
I do not agree with him.	Ban yarda da shi ba.
He did not stay with one person on the ship.	Bai zauna tare da mutum daya a cikin jirgin ba.
He almost killed me.	Ya kusa kashe ni.
But then you come out.	Amma daga nan ka fito.
And of course the problem has come.	Kuma lallai matsala ta zo.
You are used to the problem.	Kun saba da matsalar.
He did it.	Ya yi shi.
Get another one.	Samu wani kuma.
Life was good.	Rayuwa ta kasance mai kyau.
Exactly the same thing.	Daidai abu ɗaya ne.
Since then nothing has happened.	Tun daga nan babu wani abu daya faru.
But for us, we do not want to miss out on these opportunities.	Amma a gare mu, ba ma so mu bata wata dama.
You can get it at home yet.	Kuna iya samun shi a gida tukuna.
It can still be done.	Har yanzu ana iya yi.
They are still there.	Suna nan har yanzu.
I can do that in any kind of film.	Zan iya yin hakan a kowane irin fim.
Maybe life is too hot now.	Wataƙila rayuwa ta yi zafi sosai yanzu.
I walk and talk, talk and walk.	Ina tafiya da magana, magana da tafiya.
It was easy.	Ya ba da sauƙi.
I will never forget that decision.	Ba zan manta da wannan shawarar ba.
One method works for a while.	Hanya ɗaya tana aiki na ɗan lokaci.
I don't like it one.	Bana son shi daya.
The first two have worked hard for many years.	Biyu na farko sun yi aiki mai girma na shekaru da yawa.
It does not feel good.	Bata ji dadi ba.
I hope you are not leaving yet!	Ina fatan ba za ku tafi ba tukuna!
People like that.	Mutane irin haka.
It happened in the afternoon.	Ya faru da rana.
A policeman was sent to the scene.	An aika dan sanda zuwa wurin.
Three times she did it.	Sau uku ta yi.
Sorry about that.	Yi hakuri a baya.
From time to time, but it also takes a long life.	Daga lokaci zuwa lokaci, amma kuma yana ɗaukar tsawon rayuwa.
She knew she didn't want to.	Ta san ba ta so.
People come every day.	Mutane suna ta zuwa kowace rana.
There is nothing new about this.	Babu wani sabon abu game da wannan.
If you do that, you are not healthy.	Idan kun yi haka, ba ku da lafiya.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai bane.
And kids even more so.	Kuma yara ma fiye da haka.
I can’t just let him die.	Ba zan iya barin shi kawai ya mutu ba.
We will do it.	Za mu yi shi.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
I feel the need to explain this to everyone.	Ina jin bukatar bayyana wannan ga kowa da kowa.
How much is too much?	Nawa kadan ne.
It rained a lot.	An yi ruwan sama sosai.
They really love each other.	Da gaske sun so juna.
It should be simple.	Ya kamata ya zama mai sauƙi.
This is the first time to take action.	Wannan lokaci ne na farko don ɗaukar aiki.
What.	Menene.
They were before.	Sun kasance a da.
She was later released.	Daga baya aka sake ta.
It must be cut.	Dole ne a yanke shi.
He left it behind.	Ya bar shi a baya.
He can.	Zai iya.
What kind of person would he do.	Wane irin mutum zai yi.
However, that is certainly not true.	Duk da haka, tabbas hakan ba gaskiya bane.
I didn’t care for anyone.	Ban kula kowa ba.
Tonight, he will have that opportunity.	A daren yau, zai sami wannan damar.
He knows everything and nothing.	Ya san komai kuma ba komai.
That doesn't make it any better.	Hakan bai sa ya fi kyau ba.
I know it's a lot.	Na san yana da yawa.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya zo kenan.
Like some are in the same boat.	Kamar wasu suna cikin jirgin ruwa guda.
However, this may not be true.	Duk da haka, wannan ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
And he will bring the police here.	Kuma zai kawo 'yan sanda nan.
I can't think of anything.	Ba zan iya tunanin komai ba.
There is no sign, of course.	Babu wata alama, ba shakka.
Please keep this in mind.	Da fatan za a tuna da wannan.
Of course you can do more than that.	Tabbas za ku iya yin abin da ya fi haka.
It's a pleasure.	Abin farin ciki ne.
If she finds a way.	Idan ta sami hanya.
I only know the place.	Na san wurin kawai.
He also did not.	Shi ma bai yi ba.
They were not without each other.	Ba su kasance ba tare da juna ba.
But, home.	Amma, gida.
Once in a while, the moon is full.	Sau ɗaya a cikin ɗan lokaci, wata ya cika.
This worked really well.	Wannan yayi aiki sosai.
It shows a lot about this kid.	Yana nuna abubuwa da yawa game da wannan yaro.
Save us.	Ka ajiye mu.
Less than anything.	Kasa da komai.
For me, it’s both.	A gare ni, duka biyu ne.
So it's good to hear that.	Don haka yana da kyau a ji haka.
Whoever worked for her.	Duk wanda yayi mata aiki.
I want her to do everything.	Ina so ta yi komai da komai.
We can all do that.	Duk muna iya yin hakan.
The plane took off slowly at night.	Jirgin ya tashi a hankali cikin dare.
But he came back.	Amma ya dawo.
Involvement is voluntary.	An samu shiga ta hanyar son rai.
No forward vision.	Babu kallon gaba.
The others waited.	Sauran sun jira.
Police arrested the suspect at the bus station.	‘Yan sanda sun kama wanda ake zargin a tashar bas.
And sometimes you do.	Kuma wani lokacin kuna yi.
It just can't be read.	Ba za a iya karanta shi kawai ba.
He got this.	Ya samu wannan.
He will not hear.	Ba zai ji ba.
That alone is not enough.	Wannan kawai bai isa ba.
If so, the decision was not taken.	Idan haka ne, ba a ɗauki shawarar ba.
He loves women.	Shi mai son mata ne.
And not as usual.	Kuma ba kamar yadda ta saba ba.
Nothing to do.	Babu wani abin yi.
The landlord always had two for me.	Mai gida ko da yaushe yana da biyu a gare ni.
They made me see.	Sun sa ni gani.
In fact, it is definitely very fulfilling.	A gaskiya ma, tabbas ya cika sosai.
Decades ago it was.	Shekaru da yawa da suka gabata sun nuna hakan.
Every day is equal.	Kowace rana daidai take.
But they are not human.	Amma ba su kai mutum ba.
We were surprised to hear the news.	Mun yi mamakin jin labarin.
It will take years to do this.	Zai ɗauki shekaru ana yin haka.
He is suffering every year.	Yana samun wahala kowace shekara.
He works with them.	Yana aiki da su.
However, it seems to give us more.	Duk da haka, yana da alama yana ba mu fiye da haka.
Maybe it would be better.	Wataƙila zai yi kyau.
And they came to her.	Kuma suka zo ta.
They are kind of interesting.	Suna da irin ban sha'awa.
So everyone knows where he or she stands.	Ta haka kowa ya san inda shi ko ita suka tsaya.
.	.
Would you not agree ?.	Ba za ku yarda ba?.
And they wanted that.	Kuma sun so hakan.
I want it done.	Ina so ya yi.
We are the ones who will suffer.	Lallai mu ne za mu sha wahala.
However, no one likes them.	Duk da haka, ba wanda yake son su.
I know many people.	Na san mutane da yawa.
The method is as follows.	Hanyar ita ce kamar haka.
Check it out.	Duba shi.
She is very worried.	Ta damu sosai.
I think they are.	Ina tsammanin su ne.
Right there mouth.	Dama can bakin.
You arrived just in time.	Kun isa daidai lokacin.
But it is certainly simple, and speaks in tongues.	Amma tabbas yana da sauƙi, kuma yana magana cikin sauƙi.
Of course, you need to pay with your real money.	Tabbas, kuna buƙatar biya da ainihin kuɗin ku.
This he found out.	Wannan ya gano.
Everyone knows them there and loves them.	Kowa ya san su a can kuma yana son su.
The best thing we can do now is wait.	Mafi kyawun abin da za mu iya yi yanzu shine jira.
Maybe they are really, really good.	Wataƙila suna da gaske, da kyau sosai.
I never got it.	Ban taba samun shi ba.
It took time.	Ya dauki lokaci.
You will die.	Za ku mutu.
So we never.	Don haka ba mu taba.
Absolutely not, it is not.	A gaskiya a'a, ba haka ba ne.
That could be anything.	Wannan zai iya zama wani abu.
That's the problem.	Matsalar kenan.
I never really understood that.	Ban taba gane haka ba sosai.
But they hit.	Amma sun buga.
Work your way around them.	Yi aiki da hanyar ku a kusa da su.
We had a great time.	Mun sami lokaci mai kyau.
I run fast through the real truth.	Ina gudu da sauri ta cikin ainihin gaskiya.
I think it is.	Ina ganin shi ne.
And they got a good player.	Kuma sun sami dan wasa mai kyau.
He changed her day.	Ya canza rana ta.
Truth can make them fast.	Gaskiya na iya sa su sauri.
The man felt nothing.	Mutum bai ji komai ba.
We have to play with what we get.	Dole ne mu yi wasa da abin da muka samu.
What is the hardest time?	Wane lokaci ne ya fi wuya?
However, he will have to wait.	Duk da haka, zai jira.
I ran again.	Na sake gudu.
And who might even refuse me.	Kuma wanda zai iya ma ƙi yarda da ni.
It is so.	Yana da haka.
This can happen more difficult than one would like.	Wannan na iya faruwa da wuya fiye da yadda mutum zai so.
I can do that, no problem.	Zan iya yin hakan, ba matsala.
Maybe they already know it.	Wataƙila sun riga sun gane shi.
It is still useful to get them though.	Har yanzu yana da amfani don samun su ko da yake.
I'm fine the rest of the time.	Ina lafiya sauran lokacin.
Of course you know me.	Tabbas kun san ni.
Or maybe you didn’t.	Ko watakila ba ku yi ba.
Well, he didn’t tell anyone.	Da kyau, bai ce wa kowa ba.
But now you know it's not that easy.	Amma yanzu ka san ba shi da sauƙi haka.
I think everyone should too !.	Ina ganin kowa ya kamata kuma!.
Now that you know, you should be excited about last night.	Yanzu da kuka sani, yakamata ku ji daɗi game da daren jiya.
After some thought, he replied.	Bayan d'an tunani, ya amsa.
They will make a mistake.	Za su yi kuskure.
Travel with me to the station.	Yi tafiya tare da ni zuwa tashar.
Day and night.	Rana da rana.
I will work harder.	Zan kara yin aiki.
You have to do what you did.	Dole ne ku yi abin da kuka yi.
I do not want to tell you.	Ban so in gaya muku ba.
But she didn't care.	Amma bata kula ba.
But we will wait for you, as we did before.	Amma za mu jira ku, kamar yadda muka yi a baya.
I could not wait to get out of this place.	Na kasa jira na fita daga wannan wurin.
I will not find such a thing in this house.	Ba zan sami irin wannan abu a gidan nan ba.
But we have, and we can.	Amma muna da, kuma za mu iya.
Let's go out.	Mu fita.
It is something we do.	Abu ne da muke yi.
I love that !.	Ina son hakan!.
Before you buy, try us.	Kafin ka saya, gwada mu.
It works well though.	Yana da kyau aiki ko da yake.
They laughed at him again.	Dariya suka sake yi masa.
It made me feel weird, but in a positive way.	Hakan ya sa na ji ban mamaki, amma ta hanya mai kyau.
It wasn’t too hard.	Bai kasance mai wahala sosai ba.
Morning coffee time.	Da safe lokacin kofi.
He wants to change that.	Yana son canza wannan.
It does not feel good.	Bata ji dadi ba.
She could not say.	Ta kasa fada.
One does not like them.	Mutum ya kasa son su.
I understand that sometimes you need to travel.	Na fahimci cewa wani lokacin kuna buƙatar tafiya.
He knew he was making a mistake.	Ya san yana yin kuskure.
It comes out of nowhere.	Ya fito daga babu.
Even if he did.	Ko da ya yi.
Such a thing has never been seen before.	Ba a taba ganin irin wannan abu ba.
I'm not sure if I will bring it to him.	Ban tabbata ba ko zan kawo masa.
Save it slowly and use it for a while.	Ajiye shi a hankali kuma ku yi amfani da ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
So we were told.	Don haka aka gaya mana.
The thought bothered him.	Tunani ya bata masa rai.
This is sleep.	Wannan barci.
She is well known.	An san ta sosai.
That left me with only one at home.	Hakan ya bar ni da guda ɗaya a gida.
But then, that might be a good thing.	Amma sai, hakan na iya zama abu mai kyau.
Think no one is thinking.	Ka yi tunanin tunani ba wanda yake tunani.
They walk hand in hand.	Suna tafiya hannu da hannu.
He must have known.	Lallai ya sani.
Nothing can be said yet.	Ba za a iya cewa komai ba tukuna.
If it continues after you return home, that is even better.	Idan ya ci gaba bayan kun dawo gida, hakan ya fi kyau.
They are so amazing.	Suna da ban mamaki sosai.
I’ve never seen him talk so much, in fact.	Ban taba ganin shi yana magana da yawa ba, a gaskiya.
He called, but did not answer.	Ya kira, amma bai amsa ba.
I know that very well.	Na san haka sosai.
This proved difficult.	Wannan ya tabbatar da wahala.
Get on the plane.	Shiga jirgin sama.
He knows that, and he loves her for it.	Ya san haka, kuma yana son ta don haka.
Amazing things there.	Abubuwan ban mamaki a can.
Please see you at the ceremony.	Da fatan ganin ku a wurin bikin.
Get it or it must be called, no matter.	Samu shi ko dole ne a kira, komai.
You need to think a little.	Ya kamata ku ɗan yi tunani.
They like what they do.	Suna son abin da suke yi.
You know you don't have to be here.	Kun san bai kamata ku kasance a nan ba.
He is a citizen, a citizen.	Shi dan kasa ne, dan kasa.
We talked about a lot of things.	Mun yi magana game da abubuwa da yawa.
But it's just a game.	Amma wasan ne kawai.
This is over.	Wannan ya kare.
You try hard and stay healthy every day.	Kuna ƙoƙari sosai kuma ku sami lafiya kowace rana.
For this, there is nothing.	Don wannan, babu wani abu.
On the contrary, you see.	Da ya saba, ka gani.
Now, if you will just do it.	Yanzu, idan za ku yi kawai.
This is the only way to enter.	Wannan ita ce kawai hanyar shiga.
But he heard me.	Amma ya ji ni.
The years to come are uncertain.	Shekaru masu zuwa ba su da tabbas.
The night has come home.	Dare ya isa gida.
No one came near him.	Ba wanda ya zo kusa da shi.
I no longer heard.	Ban kara ji ba.
There is no way he will get that.	Babu yadda zai samu hakan.
Everything is finished as if she is going to go somewhere.	An gama komai kamar zata fita wani waje.
He decided ahead.	Ya yanke shawarar gaba.
So do you.	Haka kai na ma.
But we just enjoyed it.	Amma kawai mun ji daɗi.
I think she is dead.	Ina jin ta mutu.
It should be about now.	Kamata yayi game da yanzu.
But it doesn’t look like, now.	Amma bai yi kama ba, yanzu.
Next time we hope to stay for a month.	Lokaci na gaba muna fatan zama na wata guda.
You might think they used it well.	Kuna iya tsammanin sun yi amfani da shi sosai.
Will you hear ?.	Za ku ji?.
But no, that is not right.	Amma a'a, hakan bai yi daidai ba.
He was amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
It is not easy just to find some people doing interesting things.	Ba abu mai sauƙi ba ne kawai samun wasu mutane suna yin abubuwa masu ban sha'awa.
You know where I am going.	Kun san inda zan kai ni.
You are the only one you can't.	Kai kaɗai ne ba za ka iya ba.
He would give her that, he would give her whatever she wanted.	Shi zai mata haka, zai mata duk abin da take so.
We are just waiting.	Muna jira kawai.
Or not much at the moment.	Ko ba yawa a wannan lokacin.
That is not what she hoped for.	Ba abin da take fata ba kenan.
He came back with a lot of thoughts.	Ya dawo da tunani da yawa.
That must be good.	Dole ne wannan yayi kyau.
You want happiness.	Kuna son farin ciki.
I'm sure the man was injured.	Na tabbata mutumin ya ji rauni.
These things are all true.	Waɗannan abubuwan duk gaskiya ne.
But everyone has.	Amma kowa yana da.
Get a cup of coffee.	A sami wani kofi na kofi.
You have told me that before.	Kun gaya mani haka a baya.
He sang the best song.	Ya yi waƙa mafi kyau.
Suddenly the room gets hot.	Nan take dakin yayi zafi.
I was told to study hard.	An ce in yi karatu sosai.
You need to take good care of yourself.	Kuna buƙatar kula da kanku sosai.
But things did not turn out that way.	Amma bai kasance yadda ta zata ba.
He gave her food.	Ya ba ta abinci.
I did so and I ran very fast.	Na yi haka kuma na yi gudu sosai.
This can be a fun way to play the game.	Wannan na iya zama hanya mai daɗi don yin wasan.
It was not until the rain began to fall.	Sai da aka fara ruwan sama ya tafi.
They were closer than she expected.	Sun fi kusa fiye da yadda ta zata.
Maybe there’s a bit of fun in it.	Wataƙila akwai ɗan jin daɗi a ciki.
Do not want to know you.	Kada ku so ku san ku.
You probably will.	Da alama za ku yi.
Fear of doing the right thing.	Tsoron yin abin da yake daidai.
I have never had any use of it yet.	Ban taɓa samun wani amfani da shi ba har yanzu.
Do you want to renovate your house?	Kuna so ku gyara gidan ku?
They play more together.	Suna kara wasa tare.
Just to try it a little.	Kawai don gwada shi kadan.
I think it's weak.	Ina tsammanin yana da rauni.
And it is not.	Kuma ba haka ba ne.
They see you, you are real and they trust you.	Suna ganin ku, ainihin ku kuma sun yarda da ku.
This process is slow and time consuming.	Wannan hanyar ta kasance a hankali kuma tana ɗaukar lokaci.
He was not interested in that.	Bai yi sha'awar haka ba.
I will understand that.	Zan gane hakan.
It is that they are already there.	Shi ne cewa sun riga sun kasance a can.
You still have a chance to live.	Har yanzu kuna da damar rayuwa.
I feel safe.	Ina jin su lafiya.
We still do not know what the reason is.	Har yanzu ba mu san ko menene dalilin ba.
She certainly did a great job.	Lallai ta yi babban aiki.
I recommend you go out for lunch now.	Ina ba da shawarar ku fita cin abincin rana yanzu.
It was a difficult day for her.	Rana ce mai wahala a gare ta.
Do for him whatever you can.	Ka yi masa duk abin da za ka iya.
Yes, that's all you have to do.	Haka ne, duk aikin da za ku yi ke nan.
They did not recommend anything.	Ba su ba da shawarar komai ba.
Girls are with these and with kids.	'Yan mata suna tare da waɗannan kuma tare da yara.
I live a good life there.	Ina rayuwa mai kyau a can.
They finished eating and left.	Sun gama cin abinci suka tafi.
If anything happens it will happen now.	Idan wani abu ya faru zai faru yanzu.
Yet nothing seemed to help.	Amma duk da haka babu abin da ya zama kamar ya taimaka.
If he does, you will know.	Idan ya yi, za ku sani.
You can buy them.	Kuna iya siyan su.
Can't worry.	Ba za a iya damu ba.
Hopefully this will be accepted.	Da fatan za a yarda da hakan.
But you are surprised.	Amma kuna mamaki.
He ran from coming.	Ya gudu daga zuwa.
Know that you are not alone in feeling this way.	Ka sani cewa ba kai kaɗai ba ne a cikin wannan jin.
Even really.	Ko da mai gaske.
This article is interesting.	Wannan labarin yana da ban sha'awa.
It was then that everyone laughed a little.	Sai a lokacin kowa ya dan yi dariya.
It wasn’t immediately started.	Nan da nan ba a fara ba.
Sorry, that is what it is.	Yi hakuri, shi ne abin da yake.
It's too hot.	Ya yi zafi sosai.
We have no children.	Ba mu da 'ya'ya.
I think we have to trust each other more.	Ina tsammanin dole ne mu kara yarda da juna.
It was really amazing.	Ya kasance abin ban mamaki da gaske.
It cannot be empty.	Ba za a iya zama babu komai ba.
Come if you like.	Ku zo idan kuna so.
I was happy with it.	Na yi farin ciki da shi.
We did enough when we worked.	Mun yi abin da ya isa lokacin da muke aiki.
The best is yet to come !.	Mafi kyawun har yanzu yana zuwa!.
Read it if you need help with homework.	Karanta shi idan kuna buƙatar taimako tare da aikin gida.
It is the right time for a drink.	Daidai lokacin abin sha ne.
She will come with us.	Za ta zo tare da mu.
The room is cold.	Dakin yayi sanyi.
It lasted a day or two.	Ya wuce haka da kwana ɗaya ko biyu.
There is no world at home.	Babu wata duniya da ke gida.
Home is home.	Gida gida ne.
This is a big mistake.	Wannan babban kuskure ne.
He hopes to get a good job.	Yana fatan ya sami kyakkyawan aiki.
Actually, though, this is not true.	A gaskiya, ko da yake, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
I do not belong to them.	Ba na gare su ba.
And it appears as it is.	Kuma yana bayyana kamar yadda yake.
Maybe we know each other.	Wataƙila mun san juna.
It can take years or more.	Yana iya ɗaukar shekaru da yawa ko fiye.
We don't have that.	Ba mu da wannan.
We lived together as before.	Mun zauna tare kamar a da.
One correct answer is enough.	Amsa ɗaya daidai ta isa.
Nothing died anyway.	Babu wani abu da ya mutu ko ta yaya.
They never arrested him.	Ba su taba kama shi ba.
They took us.	Sun kai mu.
They have already thought of this.	Sun riga sun yi tunanin wannan.
But in the world.	Amma a duniya.
It is not a pleasure of this work.	Ba abin jin daɗi ba ne na wannan aikin.
Hope you enjoy it here.	Da fatan za ku ji daɗi a nan.
He is telling the truth.	Gaskiya ya ke fada masa.
I'm not sure who started this conversation.	Ban tabbata wanda ya fara wannan magana ba.
Everything	Kowane abu
And it worked, in the end.	Kuma ya yi aiki, a ƙarshe.
For some, it may take a day or two.	Ga wasu, zai ɗauki kwana ɗaya ko biyu.
She has a name.	Tana da suna.
I am on my way	Ina kan hanya
Play here.	Wasa a nan.
Maybe someone knows more.	Wataƙila wani ya san ƙarin.
But they work very well.	Amma suna aiki sosai.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lokaci yayi don yin abin da yake daidai.
I know for sure it is not right to do.	Na san tabbas ba daidai ba ne a yi.
You know you're good.	Ka san kana da kyau.
By something else.	Ta wani abu kuma.
He decided to go.	Ya yanke shawarar zai tafi.
I have never seen.	Ban taba gani ba.
Maybe it was too much or too little.	Wataƙila ya kasance da yawa ko kaɗan.
We think we can make sure they do.	Muna tsammanin za mu iya tabbatar da cewa sun yi.
It takes a little effort.	Yana buƙatar ɗan ƙoƙari.
It should not be difficult.	Bai kamata ya zama mai wahala ba.
How they use it.	Yadda suke amfani da shi.
There is nothing wrong with being human.	Babu komai game da zama mutum.
We also have something to prepare.	Haka kuma muna da abin da za mu shirya.
She is not alone, she said.	Ba ita kadai ba, in ji ta.
I'm sure you will hear that.	Na tabbata za ku ji haka.
And for a long time nothing happened.	Kuma tsawon lokaci babu abin da ya faru.
She said.	Ta fad'a.
I think it fits our plan.	Ina ganin ya dace da shirin mu.
They have to accept that.	Dole ne su yarda da hakan.
I do it every day.	Ina yi kowace rana.
He did such a wonderful job.	Ya yi irin wannan kyakkyawan aiki.
I caught him.	Na kama shi.
He must have been there somewhere.	Dole ne ya kasance a can wani wuri.
It will leave you with them right.	Za ta bar ka da su daidai.
He has been home for many years.	Ya kasance gida tsawon shekaru da yawa.
It's there.	Yana can.
Here are some of mine.	Ga wasu nawa.
She left and was left behind.	Ta tafi aka bar shi a baya.
I can't let it go.	Ba zan iya barin shi ya tafi ba.
No, she would not.	A'a, ba za ta yi ba.
Doing something positive will definitely help.	Yin wani abu mai kyau tabbas zai taimaka.
We reviewed a second.	Mun sake duba na biyu.
And write when you can.	Kuma rubuta lokacin da za ku iya.
It's nothing.	Ba komai ba ne.
It seems to be a lie.	Da alama karya ce.
Something might happen to check.	Wani abu na iya faruwa duba.
I don't even know where to start.	Ban ma san ta inda zan fara ba.
It looks weak, but it's definitely amazing.	Ya yi kama da rauni, amma tabbas abin mamaki ne.
Tell me what you can do.	Faɗa mini abin da za ku iya yi.
I think it's just me.	Ina tsammanin ni ne kawai.
They are not difficult after all.	Ba su da wuya bayan duk.
We are not looking for anything.	Ba ma neman komai.
This is happening.	Wannan yana faruwa.
It's too late, of course.	Ya makara, tabbas.
If I were you, school would start coming.	Idan ni ne, makaranta za ta fara zuwa.
It’s something you want to work for.	Abu ne da kuke son aiki zuwa gare shi.
They have worked together for many years.	Sun yi aiki tare tsawon shekaru da yawa.
Now we take it seriously.	Yanzu mun dauki hakan a hankali.
He's tired, and he's not very good at it.	Ya gaji, kuma ba shi da kyau sosai.
Of course, you can get injured.	Tabbas, kuna iya samun rauni.
He did not understand.	Bai gane ba.
I stopped working, man.	Na tsaya aiki, mutum.
This method will be taken here.	Za a ɗauki wannan hanyar a nan.
I joined right.	Na shiga daidai.
Let's see how this came about.	Bari mu ga yadda hakan ya faru.
I can't go for years.	Ba zan iya zuwa tsawon shekaru ba.
And so they saw.	Kuma haka suka gani.
Everything is dead.	Komai ya mutu.
This car is close to capacity.	Wannan motar tana kusa da iya aiki.
Maybe it would be better if he didn't say anything.	Wataƙila zai fi kyau idan bai ce komai ba.
He confirmed that tonight.	Ya tabbatar da haka a daren nan.
The big man is in the room.	Babban mutum yana cikin dakin.
So do we.	Haka mu ma.
Now he.	Yanzu ya .
I hope you enjoy reading this book.	Ina fatan za ku ji daɗin karanta wannan littafin.
No one went out to work.	Babu wanda ya fita aiki.
I killed them.	Na kashe su.
Bring them now.	Kawo su yanzu.
They should not have started without me, he thought.	Gara kada su fara ba tare da ni ba, ya yi tunani.
I want to give it a chance.	Ina so in ba shi dama.
Something is going to happen now.	Wani abu zai faru a yanzu.
Not really.	Ba sosai ba.
You will find a way.	Za ku sami hanya.
No one wins when that happens.	Babu wanda yayi nasara idan hakan ta faru.
It is no longer used.	An daina amfani da shi.
Maybe a year.	Wataƙila shekara guda.
Before eating, they sat in the car in a difficult position.	Kafin cin abinci, a mota suka zauna a wuya.
Before removing it make sure you turn off the water.	Kafin ka cire ka tabbata ka kashe ruwan gidan.
It is a restaurant, a restaurant.	Wurin gidan cin abinci ne, wurin cin abinci.
I still haven’t worked with it.	Har yanzu ban yi aiki da shi ba.
What a great day.	Abin da babban rana.
He was not the only one who remembered her.	Ba shi kaɗai ya tuna da ita ba.
So you can't change it.	Don haka ba za ku iya canza shi ba.
Music makes us happy.	Waƙa tana sa mu farin ciki.
He will tell you the future story.	Zai ba ku labarin nan gaba.
So your use is good.	Don haka amfani da ku yayi kyau.
It is too late.	Yanzu ya makara.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
They decide to stay where they are.	Suka yanke shawarar su tsaya a inda suke.
But maybe you can help me.	Amma watakila za ku iya taimaka mini.
Something bad was happening to him.	Wani abu da ba shi da kyau yana faruwa da shi.
Think back, just think back.	Tunani a baya, kawai tunani baya.
You assume it is nothing.	Ka dauka ba komai ba ne.
The car stopped.	Mota ce ta tsaya.
It's healthy too.	Yana da lafiya kuma.
Many people find it interesting.	Mutane da yawa suna ganin abin ban sha'awa.
Let's do that now.	Bari mu yi haka yanzu.
And that is happening.	Kuma hakan yana faruwa.
No one will protect you.	Babu wanda zai kare ku.
And this is interesting.	Kuma wannan yana da ban sha'awa.
After all there is something he is always interested in.	Bayan shi duka akwai wani abu da ya ke sha'awa kullum.
I feel like a child.	Ina jin kamar yaro.
In the world.	A duniya.
And it will do just fine.	Kuma za ta yi daidai.
And so it has been since then.	Kuma haka ya kasance tun daga lokacin.
I am ready to accept whatever comes my way.	Na shirya yarda da duk abin da ya zo mini.
Well done to you !!.	Da kyau ku!!.
You can be sure that she will get the job.	Kuna iya tabbatar da cewa za ta sami aikin.
But he will get nothing.	Amma ba zai samu komai ba.
That was a new phenomenon.	Wannan da ya kasance sabon sabon abu.
He told her everything he knew.	Ya gaya mata duk abin da ya sani.
Very funny, helpful and confirmed that you are fine.	Abin ban dariya sosai, taimako kuma an tabbatar da cewa kun kasance lafiya.
He went, as it were.	Ya tafi, kamar haka.
Not gone.	Ba a tafi ba.
He was the first person on board.	Shi ne ya fara shiga jirgin.
I have to get home.	Dole ne in isa gida.
Be the best.	Kasance mafi kyau.
This car is fast.	Wannan motar tana da sauri.
That alone is not enough time.	Wannan kawai bai isa lokaci ba.
He hits it like this.	Yana buga shi kamar haka.
I asked him if he could please come.	Na tambaye shi ko zai iya don Allah ya zo.
He did not speak.	Bata yi magana ba.
I don't know what to do now.	Ban san me zan yi ba yanzu.
I don't know what it is.	Ban san ko menene ba.
I want that to work badly.	Ina son hakan ya yi mummunan aiki.
I did not read the latter.	Ban karanta karshen ba.
We should have left this until tomorrow.	Da ma mun bar wannan har gobe.
And after reading the article.	Kuma bayan karanta labarin.
Benefit.	Amfani.
Do not make them wait.	Kada ku sa su jira.
The one who ended up there.	Wanda ya kare a can.
If he can’t help you now, he will in the future.	Idan ba zai iya taimaka muku ba a yanzu, zai yi a nan gaba.
The room is nice.	Dakin yayi kyau.
They are right where you are.	Suna daidai inda kuke.
It is not an easy task.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
All the players love it.	Duk 'yan wasan suna son shi.
He heard it.	Ya ji shi.
You will be better cared for.	Za a fi kula da ku.
Of course she was.	Tabbas ta kasance.
But they are not good.	Amma ba su da kyau.
People do not like it.	Mutane ba sa son shi.
Sorry to hear that.	Yi hakuri da jin haka.
Just be someone else.	Kawai zama wani.
He will die.	Zai mutu.
However you should not go for this.	Duk da haka bai kamata ku tafi da wannan ba.
We never wanted to leave.	Ba mu taɓa son barin ba.
You do not understand, how.	Ba ku gane ba, ta yaya.
She was very similar to me.	Ta kasance kama da ni sosai.
It's true.	Gaskiya ne.
I had to do everything myself.	Dole ne in yi komai da kaina.
He added nothing and did not need to.	Bai kara cewa komai ba kuma baya bukata.
She should have returned to him.	Ya kamata ta dawo masa.
She never laughed.	Bata taba dariya ba.
They are growing.	Suna yin girma.
That's what we did with them.	Haka muka yi da su.
We did really well.	Mun yi kyau sosai.
Everything was too much for him.	Duk abin ya yi masa yawa.
The day was such a day.	Ranar ta kasance irin wannan rana.
This seems like the right time.	Wannan ya zama kamar lokacin da ya dace.
She heard him crying.	Ta ji yana kuka.
It turns out that people really like it.	Ya zama cewa mutane suna son shi sosai.
My dog ​​will stay with me.	Kare na zai zauna tare da ni.
It was to focus on the future.	Ya kasance don a mai da hankali kan gaba.
And it works really well.	Kuma yana aiki sosai.
To tell him how things are at home.	Don gaya masa yadda abubuwa suke a gida.
If you make a mistake, it is not a good thing.	Idan kun sami kuskure, ba abin daɗi ba ne.
We cannot be in trouble for anything.	Ba za mu iya zama cikin wahala ga komai ba.
One year passed.	Shekara daya ta wuce.
I'll give you a drink if available.	Zan ba ku abin sha idan akwai.
Man to man.	Mutum ga mutum.
They seem to fit in with each other.	Ga alama sun yi daidai da juna.
Either way, it should be tested.	Ko ta yaya, ya kamata ya gwada.
She would hate him if she found out the truth.	Za ta ƙi shi idan ta gano gaskiya.
You know the place.	Kun san wurin.
But he had a real opportunity.	Amma ya sami dama ta gaske.
But you did.	Amma kun yi.
Running is everything in the fight.	Gudu shine komai a cikin fada.
I will continue to do so.	Zan ci gaba da yin haka.
Nothing about me.	Babu komai a kaina.
He joined himself.	Ya shiga kansa.
They were behind us.	Sun kasance a bayan mu.
This is another way to show it.	Wannan wata hanya ce ta nuna hakan.
We have today.	Muna da yau.
He would say he would change but it was a lie.	Zai ce zai canza amma karya ne.
Equal	Daidai
I want you to have this.	Ina so ku sami wannan.
I have met the man several times.	Na hadu da mutumin sau da yawa.
Yet they did nothing.	Amma duk da haka ba su yi komai ba.
What is correct should be clear.	Abin da ke daidai ya kamata ya bayyana.
I do not know where he is from.	Ban san daga ina yake ba.
This should help him a little.	Wannan ya kamata ya taimaka masa kadan.
I want to say.	Ina so in ce.
I never told anyone about them.	Ban taba gaya wa kowa game da su ba.
There must be a way out of this.	Dole ne a sami hanyar fita daga nan.
We will hurry if we will.	Za mu yi sauri idan za mu yi.
Just remember the seat.	Ka tuna wurin zama kawai.
This is nothing new.	Wannan ba sabon abu ba ne.
It is not difficult to see why.	Ba shi da wuya a ga dalilin da ya sa.
The second time it has a name.	A karo na biyu yana da suna.
But it really is.	Amma da gaske ne.
You must leave.	Dole ne ku fita.
So what a fit.	Don haka abin da ya dace.
You see, we don't really like you anymore.	Ka ga, ba ma son ka sosai kuma.
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.	Na kasance a wurin da bai dace ba a lokacin da bai dace ba.
That explains it.	Wannan ya bayyana shi.
That has never been the case.	Hakan bai taba zama gaskiya ba.
Something is wrong there.	Wani abu ba daidai ba a can.
I can't say she didn't go out.	Ba zan iya cewa ba ta fita ba.
I think you will understand.	Ina tsammanin za ku gane.
Take it.	Ya fi ni.
But don't think too much of me.	Amma kada ku yi mini tunani sosai.
What kids do.	Abin da yara ke yi.
I got this	Na samu wannan
She seemed uncomfortable.	Ta yi kamar babu dadi.
Sometimes they just don't seem to mind.	Wani lokaci suna ganin ba su damu ba.
I feel comfortable around them.	Ina jin dadi a kusa da su.
In fact progress has been made rapidly.	A gaskiya an samu ci gaba cikin sauri.
You know very well why.	Ka san da kyau dalilin da ya sa.
I waited for it to start.	Na jira ya fara.
He let me get it.	Ya bar mani in samu.
He fell into the room.	Ya fad'a cikin d'akin.
They were successful in the end.	Sun kasance masu nasara a ƙarshe.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Babu wani abu da ya wuce haka.
This should not come as a surprise.	Wannan bai kamata ya zo da mamaki ba.
Something strange happened in the moon.	Wani abu mai ban mamaki ya fada cikin wata.
It was a dog, and he died.	Kare ne, kuma ya mutu.
Of course I heard that.	Tabbas na ji haka.
What kind of game is this happening.	Wane irin wasa ne wannan ke faruwa.
Give the person a chance.	Ka ba mutumin dama.
Do not see what is happening.	Kar ku ga abin da ke faruwa.
He can't get a job.	Ba zai iya samun aiki ba.
He says now he is coming to kill us.	Yace yanzu yana zuwa ya kashe mu.
The good stuff is really good.	Abubuwan da ke da kyau suna da kyau sosai.
I know what she wants.	Na san abin da take so.
You can eat whenever you want.	Kuna iya ci duk lokacin da kuke so.
I will not be happy with it.	Ba zan yi farin ciki da shi ba.
First, the story is interesting.	Na farko, labarin yana da daɗi.
So, it's good.	Don haka, yana da kyau.
There is nothing in it.	Ba komai a ciki.
I used to go there.	Na sha zuwa wurin.
She was running so fast that she lost her way completely.	Gudu take da sauri har ta rasa hanya gaba daya.
I love them.	Ina son su.
We had some problems but not really.	Mun ɗan sami matsala amma ba da gaske ba.
It filled me with wonder.	Ya cika ni da ban mamaki.
He grew up late.	Ya girma a makara.
I know you will not stop until you find a way.	Na san ba za ku daina ba har sai kun sami hanya.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba abin mamaki ba ne.
I will not do it.	Ba zan yi ba.
I want to be someone	Ina so in zama wani
I have a name	Ina da suna
Despite the fact that she helped him.	Duk da cewa ta taimaka masa.
Hurry up about it, will you?	Da sauri game da shi, za ku?
This is just a fact.	Wannan gaskiya ce kawai.
I wish she never missed this.	Ina son ta taba rasa wannan.
There is nothing more to lose, it seems.	Babu wani abu kuma da za a rasa, da alama.
But the story does not stop there.	Amma labarin bai tsaya nan ba.
The night has come home.	Dare ya isa gida.
I want to go for a while.	Ina so in tafi na ɗan lokaci.
Now she could not run away from him.	Yanzu ta kasa gudu masa.
Come on in, take a look and enjoy yourself!	Shiga ku ji daɗi!.
No one told me it would be so.	Babu wanda ya gaya mani zai kasance haka.
I passed the first time.	Na wuce karo na farko.
There will never be another.	Ba za a taɓa samun wani ba.
She got up to work.	Ta tashi aiki.
It's too big.	Ya yi girma da yawa.
And other problems.	Da sauran matsala.
This is the first time we are drinking.	Wannan ne karo na farko kuma muna sha.
No more lots of it.	Babu sauran yawa daga ciki.
Being together again, just the two of us.	Da yake nan tare kuma, mu biyu kawai.
But enough talk.	Amma isa magana.
I was very sad.	Na kasance bakin ciki sosai.
Now is her chance.	Yanzu dama ce ta.
Bring it, people.	Ku zo da shi, mutane.
I'll be honest.	Zan yi gaskiya.
Suffering is not good, ignorance is not good or good.	Wahala ba ta da kyau, rashin sanin wani abu ba shi da kyau ko kuma mai kyau.
He was worried about how long it would be.	Ya damu da tsawon lokacin da zai kasance.
You have never seen anything like it.	Ba ka taba ganin wani abu kamar ni ba.
She cries a lot.	Kuka take sosai.
The truth is amazing.	Gaskiya abin mamaki ne.
You know your way home.	Kun san hanyar ku a cikin gida.
You grow it.	Kuna girma shi.
And they are bigger than the players.	Kuma suna da girma daga 'yan wasan.
Nothing can be said.	Ba abin da za a iya cewa.
And it works for me.	Kuma yana aiki a gare ni.
The good news is, you won’t know it.	Kyakkyawan shine, ba za ku san shi ba.
We had better let that happen.	Gara mu bar hakan ta faru.
They almost lost everything.	Sun kusa rasa komai.
Not much time.	Babu lokaci mai yawa.
I have a way.	Ina da hanya.
I never thought that would happen.	Ban taba tsammanin hakan zai faru ba.
What we will do later.	Abin da za mu yi a baya.
He just came out.	Ya fita kawai.
He opened them again.	Ya sake bude su.
It's home.	Yana da gida.
We all laughed so hard.	Mu duka muka yi dariya sosai.
However, he did not go.	Duk da haka, bai tafi ba.
Stand back, please.	Tsaya baya, don Allah.
I hope someone benefits from it.	Ina fatan wani ya sami amfani daga ciki.
Truth be told otherwise.	Gaskiya ta ce in ba haka ba.
But she felt safe, not really.	Amma ta ji babu abin tsoro, ba da gaske ba.
Where you sent many others.	Wurin da kuka aika wasu da yawa.
Although not as good as you.	Ko da yake ba ta da kyau kamar ku.
Twice a week.	Sau biyu a mako.
I really don't know where she got that idea.	Lallai ban san inda ta samu wannan tunanin ba.
I looked at the sweet mouth.	Na kalli bakin mai dadi.
I think this is real.	Ina ganin wannan shi ne da gaske.
I have not seen any of this.	Ban ga ko ɗaya daga cikin wannan ba.
Absent.	Ba ya nan.
And you just feel really good.	Kuma kawai kuna jin rai sosai.
For one day.	Na kwana daya.
Developers are easy.	Masu ci gaba suna da sauƙi.
It is not difficult to start.	Ba shi da wuya a fara.
I left nothing.	Ban bar komai ba.
But this is not always the case.	Amma ba koyaushe ake yin hakan ba.
But you have to get involved.	Amma dole ne ku shiga ciki.
I did not think so.	Ban yi tunanin haka ba.
So however, about my weekend.	Don haka duk da haka, game da karshen mako na.
She was very intelligent.	Ta kasance mai hankali.
For your best.	Don mafi kyawun ku.
Get everything you can.	Samu duk abin da za ku iya.
He died here and no one ever came.	Ya mutu a nan kuma ba wanda ya taɓa zuwa.
The house was exactly as described.	Gidan ya kasance daidai kamar yadda aka bayyana.
Few people look up.	Mutane kaɗan ne ke kallon sama.
He has no money on it.	Ba shi da kudi a kansa.
I want to hear from you.	Ina son ji daga gare ku.
They are right.	Suna daidai.
It even looks good on its own.	Har ma yana da kyau a kan kansa.
Players win when the time is right.	'Yan wasan suna nasara idan lokaci ya yi.
I love her.	Ina son ta.
This book is this book.	Wannan littafin shine wannan littafin.
She needs me.	Tana bukata na.
Go ahead, fast.	Ci gaba, da sauri.
There they spent the night.	Nan suka kwana.
Nice to see you guys !.	Na yi farin cikin ganin kun ji daɗi!.
Almost everyone laughed.	Kusan kowa yayi dariya.
It is a feeling of success.	Wani ji na nasara ne.
And he decided to take everything.	Kuma ya yanke shawarar ɗaukar komai.
Their thinking is beyond me.	Yadda suke tunanin hakan ya wuce ni.
It is something that will live with us.	Abu ne da zai zauna tare da mu.
At this point.	A wannan lokaci.
I did nothing, though.	Ban yi mini komai ba, ko da yake.
People can be amazing.	Mutane na iya zama masu ban mamaki.
It is an amazing place.	Wuri ne mai ban mamaki.
I feel they have been used a lot.	Na ji an yi amfani da su sosai.
It will be on his head immediately.	Zai kasance a kansa nan take.
The simple thing is, she gets tired easily.	Abu mai sauƙi shine, ta gaji da sauƙi.
You're just looking for a job.	Kuna kawai neman aiki.
Effortless and easy.	Rashin ƙoƙari da sauƙi.
I beg to differ.	Ban yarda ba.
And we did well.	Kuma mun yi kyau.
I'm sure this is a winner.	Na tabbata wannan shine mai nasara.
I think that is good.	Ina ganin hakan da kyau.
I sat down quickly.	Na zauna da sauri.
He was very busy, but he was tired.	Ya cika da aiki, sai ya ga ya gaji.
I wish you well.	Da na yi muku kyau.
I bring you into this.	Na kawo ku cikin wannan.
She never got it, though.	Ba ta taba samun ba, ko da yake.
I'll sleep this for a little while.	Zan kwana wannan kadan kadan.
I hope you enjoy it.	Ina fatan za ku yi amfani da shi sosai.
He will not return.	Ba zai dawo ba.
I returned to school the first day.	Na dawo makaranta ranar farko.
The rest are eating.	Sauran suna ci.
I want to have it with us.	Ina son samun shi tare da mu.
It's too much.	Yayi yawa.
With this book.	Da wannan littafin.
Too much, maybe.	Da yawa, watakila.
You just need to be yourself.	Kuna buƙatar zama kanku kawai.
They came.	Suka zo.
We know this is not true.	Mun san cewa wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Do you remember me.	Kuna tuna ni.
Indeed, it is a beautiful place.	Lallai, wuri ne mai kyau.
The story is common.	Labarin na kowa ne.
Efforts must be made in this way.	Dole ne a yi ƙoƙari ta wannan hanya.
He knows who is talking.	Ya san wanda ke magana.
What a distraction.	Abin da hankali.
What we do.	Abin da muke yi.
They did not think of anything.	Ba su yi tunanin komai ba.
The children went back to school.	Yara sun koma makaranta.
People are convinced that they are on something.	Mutane sun tabbata cewa suna kan wani abu.
The work is huge for him.	Aikin yana da girma a gare shi.
It is about now.	Ya kasance game da yanzu.
She just laughed.	Dariya kawai ta yi.
And that is what she needs now.	Kuma abin da take bukata kenan yanzu.
We can tell.	Za mu iya gaya.
He will begin to kill them.	Zai fara kashe su.
What are you planning for next week?	Me kuke shirin mako mai zuwa.
If they arrest me again.	Idan sun sake kama ni.
She is thinking.	Tunani take yi.
It seemed like it had to be someone else.	Ya zama kamar dole ya zama wani.
, ba ni ba.	, ba ni ba.
If that happens.	Idan abin ya faru.
And they are so beautiful.	Kuma suna da kyau sosai.
He spoke very well.	Yayi magana sosai.
You can be.	Kuna iya zama.
Now tell me your story.	Yanzu gaya mani labarin ku.
There she decided that she would not marry.	A can ta yanke shawarar cewa ba za ta yi aure ba.
There is definitely no way.	Babu shakka babu hanya.
You must arrive in the morning.	Dole ne ku isa da safe.
Some may make mistakes.	Wasu na iya yin kuskure.
Don't let that happen.	Kar hakan ta faru.
It seems that no one really knows him.	Da alama babu wanda ya san shi sosai.
It will always be and always will be.	Koyaushe zai kuma kasance koyaushe.
I waited for the right moment and the time is now.	Na jira lokacin da ya dace kuma lokaci ya yi yanzu.
Not nearly as well.	Ba kusan yadda ya kamata ba.
She changed.	Ta canza.
We do not start with everyone.	Ba mu fara komai da kowa.
She's almost scared.	Kusan tana jin tsoro.
Things should change.	Ya kamata abubuwa su canza.
But that is not right.	Amma hakan bai yi daidai ba.
Not the car.	Ba motar ba.
You have never done this before.	Ba ka taba yin wannan a baya ba.
That we should wait and see.	Cewa mu jira mu gani.
In the future, she hopes to make a name for herself.	A nan gaba, tana fatan samun suna.
Children will be children, the way of the world.	Yara za su zama yara, hanyar duniya.
Maybe something will happen.	Wataƙila wani abu zai faru.
You woke me up.	Kun ji ni.
It still happens.	Har yanzu yana faruwa.
Keep playing.	Ci gaba da wasa.
Everything is there and no one speaks.	Komai yana nan ba wanda ya yi magana.
Do not worry about it.	Kar ku damu da shi.
It was an unhealthy cold day.	Ranar sanyi ce da ba ta dace ba.
Everyone is fine.	Kowa yana lafiya.
This is for other people.	Wannan ya kasance ga sauran mutane.
Everything is ready.	An shirya komai.
That will probably be of great benefit to us.	Wataƙila hakan zai yi mana amfani sosai.
It does not have to be the same thing.	Ba dole ba ne ya zama irin wannan abu ɗaya.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
I am really happy here.	Ni gaskiya mai farin ciki ne a nan.
However, this is not entirely true.	Duk da haka, ba gaskiya ba ne gaba ɗaya.
You must be happy.	Dole ne ku yi farin ciki.
We need water to work.	Muna buƙatar ruwa don aiki.
We need something new, something new.	Muna buƙatar wani sabon abu, sabon abu.
Now he is afraid to do the work.	A yanzu yana tsoron yin aikin.
But no one really knows what to do.	Amma babu wanda ya san abin da zai yi.
No wonder some of them cried.	Ba mamaki wasu na kuka.
However, a good thing to think about.	Duk da haka, abu mai kyau don yin tunani.
So sit down.	Don haka ku zauna.
I think a lot of people will see it funny.	Ina tsammanin mutane da yawa za su ga abin dariya.
They use every method.	Suna amfani da kowace hanya.
And he will kill her.	Kuma zai kashe ta.
But it seems that there are some who do not.	Amma da alama akwai wasu da ba sa.
What a game, and a joke about it.	Wane irin wasa ne, kuma abin dariya ne a kansa.
They looked at each other.	Suka kalli juna.
Life is still wonderful.	Rayuwa har yanzu tana da ban mamaki.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba abin mamaki ba ne.
Let him run.	Ka bar shi ya gudu.
He said it would not work.	Ya ce ba zai yi aiki ba.
And over the years.	Kuma a cikin shekaru.
They thought she was joking.	Sun dauka wasa take yi.
It's better than me today.	Ya fi ni yau.
No matter how much she wanted to, she felt.	Duk yadda ta so, ta ji.
Sit down and think.	Zauna yayi tunani.
No one can love her.	Babu wanda zai iya son ta.
I want her to be true in her lies.	Ina so ta zama gaskiya a cikin karya.
All you have to do is go to the road.	Ya kamata ku yi shi ne zuwa hanya.
Everything the man said was a lie.	Duk abin da mutumin ya fada karya ne.
I just finished by myself.	Kawai na gama da kaina.
I have this feeling this is not fair.	Ina da wannan jin wannan bai dace ba.
On the way home from school, it started to rain, it rained a lot.	A kan tafiya gida daga makaranta, an fara ruwan sama, ruwan sama sosai.
Everyone in each.	Kowane mutum a cikin kowane.
He went out and came back several times.	Ya fita ya dawo sau da yawa.
I am in them almost every day.	Ina cikin su kusan kowace rana.
There is no way to get past it.	Babu wata hanya ta wuce shi.
Think hard and hope for it.	Yi tunani sosai kuma kuna fata shi.
And there is no life there.	Kuma babu rai a wurin.
Do it first.	Yi baya da farko.
And every victory was very enjoyable.	Kuma kowace nasara ta ji daɗi sosai.
Bring them back.	Dawo da su .
You just have to keep going.	Dole ne kawai ku ci gaba.
Wake up coffee, work, kids and sleep.	Tashi kofi, aiki, yara da barci.
I used to feel that way every day.	Na kasance ina jin haka kowace rana.
Nothing new so far.	Babu wani sabon abu har zuwa wannan lokacin.
Hakuri ya kare!	Hakuri ya kare!
She gave everything.	Ta ba da komai.
I really do.	Ina da gaske.
But no.	Amma ba .
It would be nice to see you again.	Zai yi kyau in sake ganin ku.
You will be too.	Za ku kasance kuma.
He will not return.	Ba zai dawo ba.
She could not hear anything.	Ta kasa jin komai.
And fear becomes cold fear.	Kuma tsoro ya zama sanyi tsoro.
You have to prefer others to get what you like.	Dole ne ku fi son wasu don samun abin da aka fi so.
He closed the door slowly.	Ya rufe kofar a hankali.
It came right upon us.	Ya zo daidai a kan mu.
But they work.	Amma suna aiki.
She is so beautiful.	Ta yi kyau sosai.
If you want to do this with a simpler method.	Idan kuna son yin wannan tare da wata hanya mafi sauƙi.
I have traveled a lot.	Na yi ta tafiya da yawa.
It's too hot.	Tana da zafi sosai.
Let's take a look.	Mu duba.
But it happens.	Amma yana faruwa.
With me you know where to go.	Da ni ka san inda za ka.
This took the rest of the day and the next.	Wannan ya dauki sauran rana da kuma na gaba.
I think it looks like.	Ina tsammanin nawa yayi kama.
I plan to do something.	Na shirya yin wani abu.
It happens every day.	Yana faruwa a kowace rana.
If you have anything, tell me.	Idan kuna da wani abu, ku ce mini.
We must do more than that.	Dole ne mu yi abin da ya fi wannan.
It's very fast.	Yana da sauri sosai.
Maybe, just maybe.	Wataƙila, kawai watakila.
You have to make the movie.	Dole ne ku yi fim ɗin.
Everything went up at that moment.	Komai ya tashi sama a wannan lokacin.
We do not need that.	Ba mu bukatar hakan.
It is nothing new.	Ba sabon abu bane.
That's their story.	Labarin su kenan.
For the moment.	Don lokacin.
We should not doubt.	Ya kamata mu yi shakka.
The world as we are called.	Duniya kamar yadda muke suna.
Do not leave this road for a day.	Kada ku bar wannan hanya don rana.
But he is not here now, and you are.	Amma ba ya nan a yanzu, kuma kuna.
We should all be in the heat.	Ya kamata mu duka mu kasance cikin zafi.
Either way, it has always been.	A wata hanya, ya kasance koyaushe.
This is where you will get to know yourself.	A nan ne za ku san kanku.
Everything goes against what you have been told.	Komai ya saba wa abin da aka gaya muku.
He also caused them to die right away.	Ya sa su ma sun mutu daidai.
I don’t know why she joined the program.	Ban san dalilin da yasa ta shiga cikin shirin ba.
Of course he was a watcher.	Tabbas ya kasance mai kula.
I read this book, too, a little later and I love it.	Na karanta wannan littafin, kuma, dan baya kuma ina son shi.
She was arrested a few years ago.	An kama ta shekaru kadan da suka wuce.
That is not enough.	Wannan bai isa ba.
Something was wrong, she could hear.	Wani abu ba daidai ba, tana iya ji.
No one cared.	Babu wanda ya kula.
He was happy, man.	Ya yi farin ciki, mutum.
This error is number one.	Wannan kuskure ne abu na daya.
I don't have to say.	Bai kamata in ce ba.
We hurried until we reached a house we knew.	Muka gudu da sauri har muka isa wani gida da muka sani.
She seemed, however, overjoyed.	Ta yi kamar, duk da haka, cikin farin ciki.
This is not all.	Wannan ba duka ba ne.
It was a day for him.	Rana ce gare shi.
Night on the water, and in the morning you are there.	Dare a kan ruwa, kuma da safe kana can.
Please help me.	Don Allah a taimake ni.
He only drinks coffee.	Kofi kawai yana sha.
They come from everywhere.	Suna zuwa daga kowane wuri.
No one else is really doing it.	Babu wani kuma da gaske ake yi.
You are right.	Kun yi gaskiya.
There is no point in waiting outside.	Babu hankali a jira a waje.
That cannot be done.	Ba za a iya yin hakan ba.
They walk.	Suna tafiya.
I have never seen that.	Ban taba ganin haka ba.
I don’t know if it’s true.	Ban sani ba ko mai gaskiya ne.
It must have been tonight.	Dole ne ya kasance a daren yau.
But maybe that has changed.	Amma watakila ya canza.
So is she.	Don haka ita.
I know her.	Na san ta.
I think we play well in it.	Ina tsammanin muna wasa da kyau a ciki.
She can't help but feel.	Ba za ta iya taimakon yadda take ba.
I have no role model so.	Ba ni da abin koyi don haka.
This book has all three.	Wannan littafin yana da duka guda uku.
I don't care.	Ban damu da hakan ba.
It can come to him.	Zai iya zuwa gare shi.
I do not know where they went, but they came back.	Ban san inda suka je ba, amma sun dawo.
There are some people involved in this.	Akwai wasu mutane da ke da hannu a cikin wannan.
I didn’t think of that much.	Ban yi tunani da wannan da yawa ba.
He even asked why you left the meeting.	Har ma ya tambayi dalilin da yasa kuka fita taron.
I do not want to.	Ban so ba.
If that doesn't help there is nothing I can do.	Idan hakan bai taimaka ba babu abin da zan iya yi.
This should be done lightly.	Ya kamata a yi hakan cikin sauƙi.
God is universal and intelligent.	Allah ne duniya da hankali.
That would be amazing.	Wannan zai zama abin ban mamaki.
It seems inappropriate, anyway.	Da alama bai dace ba, ko ta yaya.
Of course, things do not always go as planned.	Tabbas ba lallai ne abubuwa su tafi haka ba.
They lived together for years, years without knowing it.	Sun zauna tare tsawon shekaru, shekaru ba tare da sani ba.
And he doesn't want to go back yet.	Kuma bai so ya koma ba tukuna.
She didn't get it.	Ba ta samu ba.
No one will help them.	Babu wanda zai taimake su.
This insomnia does amazing things for me.	Wannan rashin barci yana yi mini abubuwan ban mamaki a kaina.
You can get it now if you like it.	Kuna iya samun shi a yanzu idan kuna son shi.
This will be the last.	Wannan zai zama na ƙarshe.
At such times, it helps you a lot.	A irin wannan lokacin, yana taimaka muku da yawa.
She is not true, she is not here.	Ita ba gaskiya ba ce, ba ta nan.
And now she knows what they are.	Kuma yanzu ta san me suke.
People are afraid of what they do not know.	Mutane suna tsoron abin da ba su sani ba.
Just to test you.	Kawai don gwada ku.
Maybe you have to be there to catch a laugh.	Wataƙila dole ne ka kasance a wurin don kama abin dariya.
I'm sure you've seen what happened before.	Na tabbata kun taba ganin abin da ya faru a baya.
I honestly agree with him.	A gaskiya na yarda da shi.
She did it for him.	Ta yi masa.
The hardest part.	Lokaci mafi wahala.
You do not deserve such a thing.	Ba ku dace da irin wannan abu ba.
And return home safe and sound.	Kuma a koma gida lafiya.
I can see now.	Ina iya gani yanzu.
Which is probably a mistake.	Wanda watakila kuskure ne.
He tried to think of her.	Ya yi ƙoƙarin yin tunani da ita.
People know him very little.	Mutane sun san shi kaɗan kaɗan.
One has to win, another has to lose.	Dole ne wani ya yi nasara, wani kuma ya yi rashin nasara.
It is always best to be honest.	Zai fi kyau a kasance da gaskiya koyaushe.
It's too late.	Na makara.
I will go to the restaurant.	Zan je gidan abinci.
He wants to make her very sad.	So yake ya bata mata rai sosai.
I wanted him to start school on his own.	Na so ya fara makaranta da kan sa.
You just work for me.	Kuna yi min aiki kawai.
I'm not trying to be the first.	Ba na ƙoƙarin zama na farko.
Such a thing cannot continue.     	Irin wannan abu ba zai iya ci gaba ba.     
if.	in.
Everyone sees.	Kowa ya gani.
That was not a problem for us.	Wannan bai kasance da matsala a gare mu ba.
Then he brought it all back.	Daga nan sai ya dawo da shi duka.
After school started, things went well.	Bayan an fara makaranta, abubuwa sun yi kyau.
I don't want to be alone.	Bani da kyau in kasance da kaina.
I'll check and fix it.	Zan duba in gyara shi.
He became great.	Ya zama mai girma.
This is a big mistake that we have corrected now.	Wannan babban kuskure ne da muka gyara yanzu.
Maybe that will make it more useful.	Wataƙila hakan zai sa ya fi amfani.
I know how you must feel, but this is the work of the police.	Na san yadda dole ne ku ji, amma wannan aikin 'yan sanda ne.
I don’t know what to do about it at all.	Ban san abin da zan yi game da shi gaba ɗaya ba.
He entered the room and closed the door.	Ya shiga dakin ya rufe kofar.
But he went back anyway.	Amma ya koma duk da haka.
Nothing.	Ba komai.
I was amazed at how he got that.	Na yi mamakin yadda ya samu haka.
It is known how this can happen.	An san yadda hakan zai iya faruwa.
We can be sure that they did not succeed.	Za mu iya tabbatar da cewa ba su yi nasara ba.
I hope you find help !.	Ina fatan za ku sami taimako!.
I would say that is better.	Zan ce hakan ya fi kyau.
It will come out of this.	Zata fita daga wannan.
They need me.	Suna bukata na.
And the last trip was an exciting one.	Kuma tafiya ta ƙarshe ta kasance mai ban sha'awa.
It happened.	Hakan ya faru.
This is a lot of work.	Wannan aiki ne mai yawa.
Apparently someone is real and someone is talking.	Da alama wani na gaske ne da wani yana magana.
We will come through your house too.	Za mu zo ta gidan ku ma.
It is worth reading.	Ya dace a karanta.
The rest of us move on.	Sauran mu ci gaba.
This works sometimes.	Wannan yana aiki wani lokaci.
I hope so.	Ina sa rai.
So let's see if that works.	Don haka bari mu ga ko hakan yana aiki.
It is also wrong.	Ma ba daidai ba ne.
Finally, some kind of response.	A ƙarshe, wani irin amsa.
He moved to another station.	Ya koma wata tashar.
Maybe a third.	Wataƙila na uku.
They found nothing.	Ba su sami komai ba.
I can't come and catch myself being someone else.	Ba zan iya zuwa kama ni in zama wani ba.
Nothing will happen until you work.	Babu wani abu da zai faru har sai kun yi aiki.
So we can move on now.	Don haka za mu iya ci gaba a yanzu.
Such a great movie !!.	Irin wannan fim mai kyau!!.
But she is coming with it.	Amma tana zuwa da ita.
You must see.	Dole ne ku gani.
If you suspect there is.	Idan kuna zargin akwai.
They did everything right to stay healthy.	Sun yi komai daidai don samun lafiya.
Let's do the right thing.	Mu yi abin da ya dace.
I just want them home.	Ina son su gida kawai.
You have never seen anything like it.	Ba ka taba ganin irin wannan abu ba.
Not difficult, though.	Ba wuya ba, ko da yake.
I know how it feels.	Na san yadda yake ji.
So far we have only encountered heaven with more and more.	Ya zuwa yanzu mun ci karo da sama kawai da ƙarin sama.
Come on in, take a look.	Ku zo, kun san abin da ke faruwa.
She saved the house.	Ta ajiye gidan.
I do not know what to do.	Ban san me zan yi ba.
For women at least.	Ga mata ko kadan.
Such would not be the case.	Irin wannan ba zai zama irin wannan ba.
So he went.	Don haka ya tafi.
It is a hot night.	Dare ne mai zafi.
No matter what, they will always be with me.	Koma menene, koyaushe za su kasance tare da ni.
She left us all.	Ta bar mu duka.
He started laughing.	Ya fara dariya.
The amount of this material is huge.	Yawan wannan kayan yana da girma.
Something is going wrong.	Wani abu yana faruwa ba daidai ba.
But the injury is too much to make it serious.	Amma rauni ya yi yawa don yin shi da gaske.
Maybe it's not good.	Wataƙila ba shi da kyau.
He is not well now.	Yanzu ba shi da lafiya.
I just got a call, actually.	Na sami kira kawai, a gaskiya.
I saw she did.	Na ga ta yi.
Try it and see.	Gwada shi ku gani.
May you live long and prosperous.	Allah ka zauna lafiya da tsawon rai.
You love your home.	Kuna son gidan ku.
He was in school.	Ya kasance a makaranta.
I will not be a problem.	Ba zan zama matsala ba.
Does anyone remember that?	Shin akwai wanda ya tuna da wannan?.
I saw it immediately.	Na ga haka nan take.
But, it may still be better.	Amma, har yanzu yana iya zama mafi kyau.
Thus she was pregnant.	Ta haka ta kasance cikin ciki.
One that works fine.	Wanda ke aiki lafiya.
I could not believe it when she told me.	Na kasa yarda da hakan lokacin da ta gaya min.
That was almost a year ago.	Hakan ya kasance kusan shekara guda da ta wuce.
And in the second week, he said they still haven't said anything.	Kuma a mako na biyu, ya ce har yanzu ba su ce komai ba.
Not just for work, but for everything.	Ba don aiki kawai ba, amma ga komai.
That way he doesn't have to feel around him.	Ta haka ba sai ya ji a kusa da shi ba.
There is a seating area to enjoy the view.	Akwai wurin zama don jin daɗin kallon.
I wish that you could work.	Ina son cewa za ku iya aiki.
It is not a good car, by any means.	Ba mota ce mai kyau ba, ta kowace hanya.
As usual.	Yadda suka saba.
But I never used that.	Amma ban taba amfani da hakan ba.
She asked for a drink.	Ta nemi abin sha.
I really enjoyed it.	Na samu sosai.
I have encountered it twice before.	Na yi karo da shi sau biyu a baya.
About turning it on.	Game da kunna shi.
Like nothing ever happened.	Kamar ba abin da ya taɓa faruwa.
And often it is.	Kuma sau da yawa shi ne.
Put this on.	Saka wannan.
If you are wondering whether you are planning to commit suicide.	Idan kuna tunanin ko kuna shirin kashe kanku.
No further calls.	Babu buƙatar kira gaba.
I do not think it will happen today.	Bana jin zai faru yau.
But, it was for the best.	Amma, ya kasance don mafi kyau.
I never thought of that, honestly.	Ban taba tunanin hakan ba, a gaskiya.
You are an amazing person.	Kai mutum ne mai ban mamaki.
But that is how he feels.	Amma hakan ya kai ga yadda yake ji.
I hope you feel pain anyway.	Ina fatan za ku ji zafi ta wata hanya.
A book like this may be what they need.	Littafin irin wannan na iya zama abin da suke bukata.
I am in the same boat.	Ina cikin jirgin ruwa guda.
I hear what you are saying.	Ina jin abin da kuke cewa.
Many people do not remember.	Mutane da yawa ba su tuna da haka.
You can enjoy playing with toys.	Kuna iya jin daɗin wasa da kayan wasan yara.
I did not get to come because of time.	Ban samu zuwa ba saboda lokaci.
He sits, waiting for you, with us.	Sai ya zauna, yana jiran ku, tare da mu.
They just talk, and everyone is happy.	Suna magana kawai, kuma kowa yana farin ciki.
There is not much he can do from here.	Babu wani abu da yawa da zai iya yi daga nan.
But it catches you.	Amma yana kama ku.
He would have killed them.	Da ya kashe su.
We want to make sure you don't make a mistake.	Muna son tabbatar da cewa ba ku yin kuskure.
They are eating.	Suna cin abinci.
And finally, we were taken care of.	Kuma a ƙarshe, an kula da mu.
I saw she did.	Na ga ta yi.
In so doing the reader is right.	A cikin haka mai karatu yayi daidai.
I think he never came.	Ina tsammanin bai taba zuwa ba.
This is the time of year.	Wannan lokacin ne na shekara.
We're going to do something good.	Za mu yi wani abu mai kyau.
What you pay and what you get.	Abin da kuke biya da abin da kuke samu.
I think about it for a while and call.	Ina tunani game da shi na ɗan lokaci kaɗan kuma in kira.
There is one to protect, he thinks.	Akwai wanda zai kare, yana tunani.
We do not expect anything.	Ba mu fatan komai.
I think so much today.	Ina ganin haka da yawa a yau.
Cool and forward.	Sanyi da gaba.
I love it hot !.	Ina son shi zafi!.
For me, it worked the other way.	A gare ni, ya yi aiki da sauran hanyar.
He came looking for us.	Ya zo neman mu.
Just these two things.	Kawai waɗannan abubuwa biyu.
It needs work.	Yana bukatar aiki.
I tell you the truth.	Na gaya muku gaskiya.
No one likes this.	Ba wanda yake son wannan.
I work at one.	Ina aiki a daya.
We should not do that.	Bai kamata mu yi haka ba.
I knew it would.	Na san zai yi.
This started things.	Wannan ya fara abubuwa.
I never cared about it.	Ban taba kula da shi ba.
Many died along the way.	Mutane da yawa sun mutu a hanya.
She will not miss them.	Ba za ta rasa su ba.
In fact, it kills them even more.	A gaskiya ma, yana kashe su fiye da haka.
The room was empty, but she did not feel alone.	Dakin babu kowa, amma bata ji ita kadai ba.
We have no idea.	Ba mu da wani abin tunani.
They don’t have our time.	Ba su da lokacin mu.
She went out and left the door open.	Ta fita ta bar kofar a bude.
One of two things will happen now.	Daya daga cikin abubuwa biyu zai faru yanzu.
There is someone in the house.	Akwai wani a gidan.
You can't be right.	Ba za ku iya zama daidai ba.
Something he wants to show me.	Wani abu ne yake so ya nuna mani.
Maybe he is a human being.	Wataƙila shi mutum ne.
Either way, it's fake.	Ko ta yaya, karya ne.
Many did.	Da yawa ne suka yi shi.
I like a little more than what’s there.	Ina son dan kadan fiye da abin da ke wurin.
Let's go out to eat.	Mu fita cin abinci.
So tell me this.	Don haka gaya mani wannan.
And you want them to be the best they can be.	Kuma kuna son su zama mafi kyawun abin da za su iya.
I can see the problem.	Ina iya ganin matsalar.
They have been identified.	An gano su.
Everyone agrees that this is what happened.	Kowa ya yarda abin da ya faru ke nan.
It can still happen.	Har yanzu yana iya faruwa.
Nothing works here.	Babu wani abu da ke aiki a nan.
You will be laughing in the end.	Za ku zama masu dariya a ƙarshe.
You will never know.	Ba za ku taɓa sani ba.
Can't think of much more.	Ba za a iya tunanin da yawa fiye da.
I kept thinking even if it really was.	Na ci gaba da tunanin ko da gaske ne.
I feel like now we can really start to progress.	Ina jin kamar yanzu za mu iya fara ci gaba da gaske.
This will be the third anniversary.	Wannan zai zama bikin cika shekaru uku.
I didn’t want it to be a sad place.	Ban so ya zama wurin bakin ciki ba.
So he started drinking.	Don haka ya fara sha.
He could not walk for long.	Ya kasa tafiya na tsawon lokaci.
It is not easy to find your way.	Ba shi da sauƙi don gano hanyar ku.
I got together here.	Na samu tare a nan.
Too much thought.	Tunani yayi yawa.
I have some now.	Ina da wasu a yanzu.
It's just here.	Akwai kawai a nan.
Or from here.	Ko daga nan.
Some like it.	Wasu suna son shi.
He didn’t talk to anyone about how things were out there.	Bai yi magana da kowa ba game da yadda abin ya kasance a can.
She knew she couldn't.	Ta san ba za ta iya ba.
I played there before.	Na buga can a baya.
It may take a lot of them, but eventually they will kill him.	Yana iya ɗaukar su da yawa, amma a ƙarshe za su kashe shi.
I need them to start talking to me.	Ina bukata su fara magana da ni.
It does not have a good restaurant.	Ba shi da wurin cin abinci mai kyau.
This is what they play with day and night.	Abin da suke wasa da shi ke nan dare da rana.
She was, and still is, a lot in it.	Ta kasance, kuma har yanzu tana da yawa a cikin sa.
No matter who they are, it doesn't matter.	Ko wanene su, ba komai.
Find.	Samu.
Good, quick reading.	Yayi kyau, karatu mai sauri.
He immediately prepared.	Nan da nan ya shirya.
It's just a.	Shi kawai a.
It was not known until two years ago.	Ba a san shi ba sai shekaru biyu da suka wuce.
But that just fits.	Amma wannan ya dace kawai.
From the moment we learn to read, we can.	Daga lokacin da muka koyi karatu, muna iya.
I look around the room.	Ina kallon dakin.
Things were good.	Abubuwa sun kasance masu kyau.
Just a must.	Kawai dole.
That was smart.	Wannan ya kasance mai hankali.
But nothing more to say.	Amma ba wani abu da ya kamata a ce.
That started.	Hakan ya fara.
That’s just a little bit, though.	Wannan kadan ne kawai, ko da yake.
I will finish it for you.	Zan gama muku shi.
We think there is.	Muna tsammanin akwai.
One train is tired.	Jirgin guda daya ya gaji.
They didn't talk about it.	Ba su yi magana game da shi ba.
But talk to them.	Amma magana da su.
Or get a job done.	Ko samun wani aiki yi.
How wonderful for us.	Yaya ban mamaki a gare mu.
The scorching sun made it difficult to walk.	Rana mai zafi ya sa ya yi wuya tafiya.
Best of all if we all live close together.	Mafi kyau kuma idan duk mun zauna kusa tare.
I can't play with anyone.	Ba zan iya wasa da wani ba.
I don’t know when or how or why.	Ban san yaushe ko ta yaya ko me yasa ba.
There are so many people.	Akwai mutane da yawa da yawa.
No one will know what you are saying.	Ba wanda zai san abin da kuke faɗa.
They love you so much.	Suna son ku sosai.
However, it was the best he had ever worked for her.	Duk da haka, shi ne mafi kyawun da ya taɓa yi mata aiki.
I will not let you drive.	Ba zan bar ku ku tuƙi ba.
This can be a good idea to get involved.	Wannan yana iya zama mai kyau don shiga.
I did, but it was wrong.	Na yi, amma ba daidai ba.
Read the tool carefully.	Karanta kayan aikin a hankali.
It looks healthy, but it is also weak.	Yana kama da lafiya, duk da haka yana da rauni.
Things have changed a little since then.	Abubuwa sun ɗan canza kaɗan tun daga lokacin.
He has already done so.	Ya riga ya yi haka.
So this book is on my way.	Don haka wannan littafin yana kan hanya na.
Harder than it seems at first.	Wuya fiye da alama da farko.
Exit current game.	Fita daga wasan na yanzu.
I do not have time to take care of others.	Ba ni da lokacin da zan kula da wasu.
She should never know the truth.	Kada ta taɓa sanin gaskiya .
It makes you laugh.	Yana ba da dariya.
That is not the case.	Ba haka abin yake ba.
Later we failed to turn it on.	Daga baya mun kasa kunna shi.
Live a difficult life.	Yi rayuwa mai wahala.
Like everyone else.	Kamar kowa.
They have not done so far.	Ba su yi ba ya zuwa yanzu.
Maybe there is a problem.	Wataƙila akwai wata matsala.
But really.	Amma sosai.
They are scared.	Sun ji tsoro.
He never got past that.	Bai taba samun wuce haka ba.
No one will ever know that.	Ba wanda zai taɓa sanin haka.
We were fine.	Mun kasance lafiya.
He does not want her to be upset.	Baya son ta damu.
Please let this work.	Da fatan za a bar wannan yayi aiki.
It will never happen.	Ba zai taba faruwa ba.
Lots, lots to come.	Da yawa, da yawa masu zuwa.
But she would not call the police.	Amma ba za ta kira 'yan sanda ba.
She does not want to be cared for.	Bata son kula.
There is no need to walk slowly now, because everyone is inside.	Babu buƙatar tafiya a hankali yanzu, saboda kowa yana ciki.
But he did not get it.	Amma bai samu ba.
You will hear each other.	Za ku ji juna.
I understand that very well.	Na fahimci hakan sosai.
No one can say.	Babu wanda zai iya cewa.
But what we do know is that we agree on that.	Amma abin da muka sani shi ne mun yarda a kan wannan.
There must be a way.	Dole ne a sami hanya.
She used to watch them, of course.	Ta kasance tana kallon su, tabbas.
We want to help her.	Muna son taimaka mata.
He was great.	Ya kasance mai girma.
Your article has never been published.	Ba a taɓa buga labarin ku ba.
Not everyone is the same.	Kowa ba daya bane.
When it is hot, it is hot.	Idan yayi zafi sai yayi zafi.
But no one knows.	Amma ba wanda ya sani.
She assumed it was.	Ta dauka shi ne.
The doctor stopped talking.	Likitan ya tsaya magana.
God, he must hate me.	Allah, dole ne ya ƙi ni.
He waits for her to come out.	Yana jira ta fita.
A man was arrested in shock.	An kama wani mutum da mamaki.
You have to do the work.	Dole ne ku yi aikin.
It feels so right.	Yana jin haka daidai.
In the morning.	Da safe.
That didn't help, of course.	Hakan bai taimaka ba, ba shakka.
Now I have one.	Yanzu ina da daya.
He will not give up.	Ba zai bari ba.
Do well somehow.	Yi kyau ko ta yaya.
And he will not allow that to happen again.	Kuma ba zai bari hakan ya sake faruwa ba.
And no, they don't care about me.	Kuma a'a, ba su damu da ni ba.
I haven’t changed, so it’s really weird.	Ban canza ba, don haka yana da ban mamaki sosai.
It looks like.	Yayi kama.
This is always the case.	Haka abin yake kullum.
As you say, it works in one place, not in another.	Kamar yadda ka ce, yana aiki a wuri guda, ba a wani wuri ba.
It may have rained yesterday.	Wataƙila an yi ruwan sama jiya.
He lost even self-awareness.	Ya rasa ko da sanin kai.
We must also look at the work he does.	Dole ne kuma mu kalli aikin da yake yi.
And that is not because of me.	Kuma wannan ba saboda ni ba ne.
He is running.	Yana gudu.
Travel is not common.	Tafiya ba na kowa bane.
Someone opened.	Wani mutum ya bude.
And they helped.	Kuma sun taimaka.
He would die without it.	Zai mutu ba tare da shi ba.
They will assume that you are giving them play money.	Za su ɗauka cewa kuna ba su kuɗin wasa.
For the time being, we are very happy.	Don wannan lokacin, muna jin daɗi sosai.
Like oil and water.	Kamar mai da ruwa.
Some might say that it does not work.	Wataƙila wasu za su ce ba shi da aiki.
Do not expect too much.	Kar ku yi tsammanin da yawa.
It's not me you should worry about.	Ba ni ne ya kamata ku damu ba.
He enjoys playing.	Yana jin daɗin yin wasa.
If you want to get out, pay your way.	Idan kuna son fita, ku biya hanyar ku.
He was very happy there.	Ya yi matukar farin ciki a wurin.
There they saw a crocodile in the water.	Can sai suka ga kada a cikin ruwa.
Please, please help us.	Don Allah, don Allah a taimake mu.
In the process, the man sat and waited at the station.	Ana cikin haka sai mutumin ya zauna yana jira a tashar.
Sometimes it’s good.	Wani lokaci yana da kyau.
We are not married and she does not care about the thoughts of others.	Ba mu yi aure ba kuma ba ta damu da tunanin wasu ba.
He will no longer drive.	Ba zai ƙara yin tuƙi ba.
I was tired of running away from him tonight.	Na gaji da gudu daga gare shi a daren nan.
She was surprised.	Ta yi mamaki.
They were very close, yet so far.	Sun kasance kusa sosai, duk da haka ya zuwa yanzu.
She is tired in the past.	Ta gaji a baya.
I would never do that today, of course.	Ba zan taba yin wannan a yau ba, ba shakka.
You do not want to be hurt.	Ba ku so ku ji rauni.
Getting it right the first time, and the next time should be easy.	Samun shi daidai lokacin farko, kuma lokaci na gaba ya kamata ya zama mai sauƙi.
We always sleep together.	Kullum muna kwana tare.
They can not give them.	Ba za su iya ba da su ba.
You too are not comfortable.	Kai ma ba ka ji dadi ba.
And feel useful.	Kuma jin amfani.
The plan is carefully planned.	An shirya shirin a hankali.
We, too, would not.	Mu ma, da ba haka ba.
Boat and child.	Jirgin ruwa da yaro.
Such work must speak for itself.	Irin aikin dole ne ya yi magana da kansa.
She will do some, and she will think.	Za ta yi wasu, kuma ta yi tunani.
He can help himself.	Zai iya taimaka wa kansa.
Today is a beautiful day, isn't it?	Yau rana ce mai kyau, ko ba haka ba?
This is known.	An san wannan.
So, so.	Don haka, haka.
I put it right on the back.	Na sanya shi daidai a kan baya.
It may take a while.	Yana iya ɗaukar ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
Nothing is happening.	Babu wani abu da ke faruwa.
Everything was the last resort.	Duk abin da ya kasance hanya ce ta ƙarshe.
And you are not here this morning.	Kuma yau da safe ba ku nan.
I do not understand.	Ban gane ba.
How can I fix this.	Ta yaya zan iya gyara wannan.
And, they can be again this year.	Kuma, za su iya zama kuma a wannan shekara.
Everyone enjoyed fixing me.	Kowa ya ji daɗin gyara ni.
Everyone was surprised.	Kowa yayi mamaki.
And that's why you're not ready.	Kuma shi ya sa ba ku shirya ba.
I didn't give her anything either.	Ni ma ban ba ta komai ba.
This takes some time.	Wannan yana ɗaukar ɗan lokaci.
She was alone in the room.	Ita kadai a dakin.
After all, you don't understand.	Bayan haka, ba ku gane ba.
But he was arrested like the others.	Amma an kama shi kamar sauran.
He realized what he had done.	Ya gane abin da ya yi.
They want and need you to be with them too.	Suna so kuma suna buƙatar ku kasance tare da su kuma.
They do not bring anyone here whom they encounter.	Ba sa kawo kowa nan da suka ci karo da shi.
But we give players.	Amma muna ba 'yan wasa.
This person is me.	Wannan mutumin ni ne.
The moment to get interested is when no one else is.	Lokacin samun sha'awar shine lokacin da babu wani.
He was good at things like that.	Ya kasance mai kyau ga abubuwa kamar haka.
I didn't even hear when it happened.	Ban ma ji lokacin da abin ya faru ba.
He needs a child's name.	Yana bukatar sunan yaro.
He.	Shi.
I'm very tired.	Na gaji sosai.
And fast growing.	Kuma da sauri girma.
We do not forget just a few things.	Ba ma manta wasu abubuwa ne kawai.
It is a very useful tool.	Kayan aiki ne mai matukar amfani.
Read them again.	Karanta su kuma.
And now some are drinking very little like one a day.	Kuma yanzu wasu suna shan kadan kadan kamar daya a rana.
That's what he feels.	Abin da yake ji kenan.
We are the only ones.	Mu ne kawai.
But since then she has not heard anything.	Amma tun lokacin bata ji komai ba.
No food, though.	Babu abinci, ko da yake.
The story will change.	Labarin zai canza.
Of course, we too will not learn anything from it.	Tabbas, mu ma ba za mu koyi komai daga ciki ba.
I thought of life.	Na yi tunanin rayuwa.
See it for yourself.	Duba shi da kanku.
He wanted to do this on his own.	Ya so ya yi wannan da kan sa.
Which is just a mistake, no matter how you look at it.	Wanda kawai kuskure ne, duk yadda kuke kallon sa.
It was a cold winter.	Ya kasance lokacin sanyi mai wuya.
She had a good time.	Ta samu lokaci mai kyau.
I am a human in the morning.	Ni mutum ne da safe.
Will he lose some, of course.	Shin zai rasa wasu, ba shakka.
They understand.	Sun gane.
She could not pay him.	Ba za ta iya biya masa ba.
We will find the right one.	Za mu sami wanda ya dace.
Have you eaten yet?	Kun ci abinci tukuna?
It is at this point that we do not know exactly what happened.	A wannan lokacin ne ba za mu iya sanin ainihin abin da ya faru ba.
I hope so.	Ina fatan hakan.
I never knew them.	Ban taba sanin su ba.
It did not look better than the last.	Bai yi kyau fiye da na ƙarshe ba.
The reason has been completely tested.	An gwada dalilin gaba daya.
He said he didn't.	Yace bai yi ba.
I can save something at this time.	Zan iya ajiye wani abu a wannan lokacin.
Without water there is no life	Idan babu ruwa babu rayuwa
You are right.	Kun yi gaskiya.
I looked at you.	Na duba ku.
I have only one skin.	Ina da fata guda ɗaya kawai.
They will laugh at us.	Za su yi mana dariya.
I don't care at all.	Ban damu ba ko kadan.
Lots of kids here.	Yara da yawa a nan.
We will do the rest of the day.	Za mu yi sauran rana.
That is why he is there.	Shi yasa yake can.
I think I love you.	Ina tsammanin ina son ku.
It is very comfortable to drive and it is very comfortable.	Yana da daɗi don tuƙi kuma yana da daɗi sosai.
I should not be doing this.	Bai kamata ina yin wannan ba.
I did nothing but what I wanted.	Ban yi komai ba sai abin da nake so.
I like this too.	Ina son wannan kuma.
He died.	Ya mutu.
You could say they were.	Kuna iya cewa sun kasance.
But it continued for a while.	Amma ya ci gaba na ɗan lokaci.
I will think more about this.	Zan kara yin tunani game da wannan.
It will eventually begin.	A ƙarshe zai fara.
I can not help you.	Ba zan iya taimakon ku ba.
I find it very interesting to see it grow over time.	Na ga yana da ban sha'awa sosai don ganin ya girma akan lokaci.
He wanted her.	Ya so ta.
For this the project is well suited.	Don wannan aikin aikin ya dace sosai.
I never knew when it would appear.	Ban taba sanin lokacin da zai bayyana ba.
Maybe we were closer than we knew.	Wataƙila mun kasance kusa fiye da yadda muka sani.
I, of course, did not.	Ni, ba shakka, ban yi ba.
We are made of it, we are made of it.	An yi mu da shi, muna da shi.
They should have known that.	Da ma sun san haka.
That's life.	Haka rayuwa take.
As such, .	Saboda haka, .
I hope it is still fulfilled.	Ina fatan har yanzu ya cika.
I can't let that happen.	Ba zan iya barin hakan ta faru ba.
He had to laugh.	Sai da yayi dariya.
But you have not been here this long.	Amma ba ka kasance a nan tsawon wannan lokacin ba.
If they tell you again, it's funny.	Idan sun sake gaya muku, abin ban dariya ne.
Read it to the end.	Karanta shi har zuwa ƙarshe.
They are active people.	Mutane ne masu aiki.
The real journey is here.	Tafiya ta gaske tana nan.
I can't, though.	Ba zan iya ba, ko da yake.
Or you can keep it inside.	Ko za ku iya ajiye shi a ciki.
And he killed them.	Kuma ya kashe su.
The car is moving safely.	Motar na tafiya lafiya.
This is an illness.	Wannan rashin lafiya ne.
If you look around it.	Idan ka duba a kusa da shi.
Look around.	Kalli a kusa.
Otherwise, he knew it couldn’t be true.	Ban da haka, ya san ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
I have been interested in writing this book for many years.	Na yi sha'awar rubuta wannan littafin shekaru da yawa.
He spoke slowly.	Ya fad'a a hankali.
For the world.	Don duniya.
If these things happen, be careful but do not panic.	Idan waɗannan abubuwan sun faru, ku yi hankali amma kada ku ji tsoro.
First, he failed to defend himself.	Na farko, ya kasa kare kansa.
That did not happen.	Ba haka ya faru ba.
Doing something.	Yin wani abu.
Another should read.	Wani kuma ya kamata ya karanta.
I'm sleeping now.	Ina barci yanzu.
Enough, he thought.	Ya isa, ya yi tunani.
Few people know the truth about him.	Mutane kaɗan ne suka san gaskiya game da shi.
Three people made up one house.	Mutane uku ne suka yi gida guda.
Write this material.	Rubuta wannan kayan.
Or maybe not for you.	Ko watakila ba a gare ku ba.
We felt we could play in it.	Mun ji za mu iya wasa a ciki.
If you think you can, you will.	Idan kuna tunanin za ku iya, za ku yi.
But nothing was shown.	Amma ba a nuna komai ba.
They returned home this year.	Sun koma gida bana.
I forgot only the world can read that.	Na manta kawai duniya zata iya karanta hakan.
I want to understand why.	Ina so in fahimci dalilin da ya sa.
We do not eat the same food.	Ba abinci ɗaya muke ci ba.
Another time you arrested me.	Wani lokaci kuma kun kama ni.
He took it early.	Ya dauka tun farko.
We have to try another method.	Dole ne mu gwada wata hanya.
It was like a movie.	Ya kasance kamar fim.
We are happy with it.	Mun yi farin ciki da shi.
It makes life here easier.	Yana sa rayuwa a nan ta fi sauƙi.
There, somewhere.	A can, wani wuri.
Sometimes it is not heard from you.	Nan da wani lokaci ba a ji daga gare ku ba.
She knew what she wanted to say.	Ta san abin da take so ta ce.
That made him laugh.	Abin ya bashi dariya.
There is no way it can happen.	Babu wata hanya da zata iya faruwa.
So there is one before that.	Don haka akwai daya kafin wannan.
And someone has to pay.	Kuma dole ne wani ya biya.
And I'm fine.	Kuma ina da kyau.
This year, it has a similar feeling.	A wannan shekara, yana da irin wannan jin.
It annoys me a little.	Ya dan bata min rai.
Without, of course.	Ba tare ba, ba shakka.
She began to think again.	Ta fara sake tunani.
It is true anyway.	Gaskiya ne ta wata hanya.
But life can be hard on your own, you know.	Amma rayuwa na iya yin wahala da kanku, kun sani.
But it must be fake.	Amma tabbas karya ne.
So, we were on it.	Don haka, mun kasance a kai.
Almost once a month.	Kusan sau ɗaya a wata.
So it must be very hot.	Don haka dole ne ya yi zafi sosai.
Something inside is trying to get out.	Wani abu a ciki yana ƙoƙarin fita.
Such things happen here.	Irin waɗannan abubuwan suna faruwa a nan.
I felt useful.	Na ji amfani.
I planned to lose sleep.	Na shirya na rasa barci.
I don't have to look.	Bai kamata in duba ba.
She has to answer.	Dole ta amsa.
The water was very hot during the day.	Ruwan ya yi zafi sosai a ranar.
And it hurt her.	Kuma ya yi mata wahala.
A lot of money went into the project.	Kudi da yawa sun shiga aikin.
But that would have been much easier.	Amma da hakan ya kasance mai sauƙi.
But it changes things, and not necessarily for the better.	Amma yana canza abubuwa, kuma ba lallai ba ne don mafi kyau.
But this is not.	Amma wannan ba.
Of course I don't want to be this guy.	Tabbas ba zan so in zama mutumin nan ba.
I'll call him after the game.	Zan kira shi bayan wasan.
You work on what you want.	Kuna aiki akan abin da kuke so.
Go, work, earn money.	Tafi, yi aiki, sami kudi.
In fact it is not the same thing.	A gaskiya ba abu ɗaya ba ne.
So it was with everyone.	Haka kowa ya kasance.
It was not hard for him.	Bai yi masa wuya ba.
We talked slowly to each other.	Muka yi magana a hankali da juna.
Right, who.	Dama, wanene.
He was sick and could not eat.	Ya yi rashin lafiya ya kasa ci.
I have to check.	Dole ne in duba.
He hoped she would not do that.	Ya yi fatan ba za ta yi haka ba.
But they are trying to do that.	Amma suna ƙoƙarin yin hakan.
Does he even know about.	Shin ya ma san game da.
You will find something useful.	Za ku sami wani abu mai amfani.
Wrong again!	Ba daidai ba kuma!
Everything they should give her.	Duk abin da ya kamata su ba ta.
It can also give him a good ride.	Zai iya kuma ba shi tafiya mai kyau.
Never seen.	Kada a taɓa gani.
Can you hear ?.	Za ku iya ji?.
She passed the room.	Ta wuce dakin.
Mistakes are human.	Kuskure mutum ne.
We know better.	Mun fi sani.
They will kill us.	Za su kashe mu.
Every time we do that.	A kowane lokaci da za mu yi haka.
They are few though.	Su 'yan kaɗan ne ko da yake.
But no one tried to do it.	Amma babu wanda ya yi ƙoƙari ya yi.
I can go on.	Zan iya ci gaba.
It's an amazing thing.	Abu ne mai ban mamaki.
It is wrong to do so.	Ba daidai bane yin hakan.
Which is not a good thing.	Wanda ba abu ne mai kyau ba.
She is happy.	Abin yayi mata dadi.
We didn't want that.	Ba mu so hakan ba.
There are things we call world events that take place there.	Akwai abubuwan da muke kira abubuwan duniya da suke faruwa a can.
Care must be taken.	Dole ne a yi hankali.
We read it to describe life.	Mun karanta shi don a bayyana rayuwa.
I am at home working.	Ina gida ina aiki.
He knows they will eventually give up.	Ya san a ƙarshe za su daina.
Dinner is good.	Abincin dare yana da kyau.
Not for fear of the living.	Ba don tsoron mai rai ba.
I care to be here like this.	Na damu da zama a nan kamar wannan.
It will be easy, or maybe easy.	Zai kasance da sauƙi, ko watakila sauƙi.
And slowly.	Kuma a hankali.
I do not want any problems.	Ba na son wata matsala.
When we got there, it stopped, how nice it was.	Lokacin da muka isa wurin, ya tsaya, yaya abin yayi kyau.
This, first of all.	Wannan, da farko.
Talk to yourself.	Yi magana da kanku.
Everyone including the suspect fled.	Kowa har da wanda ake zargin ya gudu.
But the real need was more than that.	Amma da gaske bukatar ta kasance fiye da haka.
And so on.	Da sauran su.
It will make it full, just as the mind did not.	Zai sa ya cika, kamar yadda hankali bai yi ba.
It's about who you care about.	Yana da game da wanda ka damu.
It still works.	Har yanzu yana aiki.
I see	ina gani
One does not abandon the past.	Mutum ba ya barin abin da ya gabata.
Some just come faster than others.	Wasu kawai suna zuwa da sauri fiye da wasu.
He came after the wet.	Ya zo bayan rigar.
That may not be right.	Hakan ba zai iya zama daidai ba.
And a lot of work goes into that.	Kuma aiki da yawa ya shiga cikin wannan.
He says he needs a lot of time.	Yace yana bukatar lokaci mai yawa.
Maybe someone tried to talk to him.	Wataƙila wani ya gwada ya yi magana da shi.
How much is this?	Nawa ne wannan?
And at first everything went amazingly.	Kuma da farko komai ya tafi da ban mamaki.
Just looking down.	Kallon kasa kawai.
She almost killed one person.	Ta kusa kashe mutum daya.
Since then he has been a man of change.	Tun daga wannan lokacin ya kasance mutumin da ya canza.
It is raining.	Ana ruwan sama.
I will kill him in real life.	Zan kashe shi a rayuwa ta gaske.
Everything that was not going to happen happened.	Duk abubuwan da ba za su faru ba sun faru.
Everyone is participating.	Kowa yana shiga.
It's from my world.	Daga duniya na ne.
At first she could not believe it.	Da farko ta kasa yarda da hakan.
That's what he thought.	Haka yake tunani.
It tastes so good.	Tana da dadi sosai.
I never understood.	Ban taba gane ba.
But she would do well with it.	Amma za ta yi kyau da shi.
He thinks it works and thinks about it.	Yana ganin yana aiki sai ya yi tunanin ta yaya.
You have to find a good way too.	Dole ne ku sami hanyar mai kyau kuma.
He will play the game.	Zai buga wasan.
I have never seen the man.	Ban taba ganin mutumin ba.
Now, that is enough.	A yanzu, wannan ya isa.
None of this.	Babu daya daga ciki.
It looks so good.	Ya yi kyau sosai.
Not sure until now.	Bai tabbata ba sai yanzu.
I have my way.	Ina da hanya ta.
As it were.	Kamar yadda ta kasance.
Sit down and think of her name, think.	Zama yayi tunanin sunan ta, yayi tunani.
As we do.	Kamar yadda muke yi.
I didn’t start that, you know.	Ban fara haka ba, ka sani.
We do this work every day.	Muna yin wannan aikin kowace rana.
I love that he just wants to work.	Ina son cewa kawai yana son yin aiki.
And such, we think, has been.	Kuma irin wannan, muna tsammanin, ya kasance.
He tried to remember when he inherited this failed.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya tuna lokacin da ya gaji wannan ya kasa.
A hot sun hit him on the head.	Rana mai zafi ta buga masa kai.
I will die.	Zan mutu.
I can't let her die.	Ba zan iya barin ta ta mutu ba.
So wait.	Don haka ku jira.
The problem has not yet been fixed.	Har yanzu ba a gyara matsalar ba.
If they die, we die.	Idan sun mutu, mu mutu.
You think.	Kuna tunani.
We can just keep going.	Za mu iya ci gaba kawai.
The man laughed so hard.	Dariya sosai mutumin yayi.
I need to remember.	Ina bukata in tuna.
Maybe that will help.	Wataƙila hakan zai taimaka.
And they will die.	Kuma za su mutu.
The money stayed with me.	Kuɗin ya tsaya tare da ni.
She enjoyed the dog.	Ta ji daɗin kare.
No, we did not.	A'a, ba mu yi ba.
We do not know what.	Ba mu san menene ba.
Be aware.	Ku kasance da sani.
One day it was like a moon.	Wata rana ta kasance kamar wata.
And we get there.	Kuma muna isa can.
It is very interesting to play.	Yana da ban sha'awa sosai don yin wasa.
Whatever it is, it will be.	Duk abin da zai kasance, zai kasance.
We can not wait.	Ba za mu iya ba da jira.
Try hitting me.	Yi ƙoƙarin buga ni.
That did not happen.	Hakan bai faru ba.
There are really a lot of tools with them.	Akwai gaske da yawa kayan aiki da su.
Good thing, such heat.	Abu mai kyau, irin wannan zafi.
Home is home.	Gida gida ne.
Wait, two cups to go, please.	Mai jira, kofi biyu don tafiya, don Allah.
Think about what you really eat each week.	Yi tunani game da ainihin abin da kuke ci kowane mako.
Nor will we be.	Ba kuma za mu kasance ba.
Everyone spoke.	Duk mutumin yayi magana.
I am not alive.	Ba ni da rai.
The work was sent today.	An aika aikin yau.
Nothing had a problem ahead of us until our big day.	Babu wani abu da ya sami matsala a kan gaba har zuwa babban ranar mu.
Run much faster.	Gudu da yawa da sauri.
Show some life.	Nuna wasu rayuwa.
Then three.	Sai kuma guda uku.
I did not look down.	Ban kalli kasa ba.
Waiting for me to come out.	Ana jira na fito.
I knew it couldn’t be easier.	Na san ba zai iya zama da sauƙi ba.
That too is very good.	Hakan ma yayi kyau sosai.
It's not something I know.	Ba abu ne na sani ba.
This is true.	Wannan gaskiya ne.
It went well.	Ya tafi da kyau.
But something else is also happening here.	Amma wani abu kuma yana faruwa a nan.
One trip a week would be hard to say.	Tafiya ɗaya a mako zai yi wuya a ce.
This is the first day of my new career.	Wannan ita ce ranar farko ta sabon aiki na.
I will never know.	Ba zan taba sani ba.
Some say it is inappropriate.	Wasu sun ce bai dace ba.
She would not mind.	Ba za ta damu ba.
Use our tools honestly.	Yi amfani da kayan aikin mu da gaskiya.
Man this thing hurts.	Mutum wannan abu yayi zafi.
I hope we find out.	Ina fatan mun gano.
The car crashed.	Motar ta fada.
But, you see.	Amma, kun gani.
They do not know how.	Ba su san yadda ba.
I know enough.	Na sani isa.
They will fill up nicely.	Za su cika da kyau.
Take your time, but hurry.	Ɗauki lokacin ku, amma yi sauri.
Do everything right.	Yi komai daidai.
Is this correct?	Shin wannan yayi daidai?
So here we are.	Don haka muna nan.
All year long.	Duk tsawon shekara.
That would be amazing.	Wannan zai zama abin ban mamaki.
He did not expect that.	Bai yi tsammanin haka ba.
He could not enter.	Ya kasa shiga.
This is me.	Wannan ni ne.
This is very interesting.	Wannan yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
We just want to hear what we want.	Abin da muke so kawai muke so mu ji.
It is not so.	Ba haka ba ne.
However, they do not suit me.	Duk da haka, ba su dace da ni ba.
He did it because he could.	Ya yi saboda zai iya.
We must be very good at doing this.	Dole ne mu yi kyau sosai da yin wannan.
Or kill them.	Ko kashe su.
Today is school and work day.	Yau makaranta ce kuma ranar aiki.
Everything you need is there.	Duk abin da kuke bukata yana can.
Nothing came out of it.	Ba wani abu ya fito daga waje ba.
Hope you can help me.	Da fatan za ku iya taimaka mini.
Everything about you.	Komai game da ku.
The dress is not very comfortable.	Rigar ba ta da kyau sosai.
I said he was dead.	Na ce ya mutu.
It makes him feel alive.	Yana sa ya ji da rai.
Many rejected him.	Mutane da yawa sun ƙi shi.
But it happened.	Amma abin ya faru.
I did you good.	Na yi muku kyau.
It is the best feeling in the world.	Shine mafi kyawun ji a duniya.
I said something.	Na ce wani abu.
Today, both are back and forth.	A yau, duka biyu sun dawo kuma sun fi da.
We want to learn and grow.	Muna so mu koyi kuma mu girma.
It rained last night.	An yi ruwan sama a daren jiya.
I'm still scared.	Har yanzu ina jin tsoro.
Sorry about that.	Yi hakuri da hakan.
Women do this sometimes.	Mata suna yin hakan wani lokaci.
We are very happy.	Muna matukar farin ciki.
This is how you find out.	Wannan shine yadda kuka gano.
Next, add all the water.	Na gaba, ƙara duk ruwa.
Very, very.	Sosai, sosai.
There are so many things in it.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa a ciki.
Type at home.	Buga a gida.
There is no reason to change this.	Babu dalilin canza wannan.
This they do.	Wannan suna yi.
He will tell you.	Zai gaya muku.
I care about her.	Na damu da ita.
The search for a missing child has begun.	An fara neman wani yaro da ya bata.
I want to do that	Ina son yin hakan
I think it hurts.	Ina tsammanin yana da zafi.
I will make sure you are safe.	Zan tabbatar kana lafiya.
She ate lunch alone.	Ta ci abincin rana ita kadai.
It is also raining.	Ana kuma yin ruwan sama.
It is closed.	An rufe shi.
Let us keep thinking.	Ka sa mu ci gaba da tunani.
He just wants to play.	Yana son wasa kawai.
Nothing is happening.	Babu wani abu da ke faruwa.
He could not help.	Ya kasa taimaka.
That is what will happen.	Abin da zai faru ke nan.
No need to put a name on it.	Ba buƙatar a sanya suna a kai ba.
It does not hurt.	Ba ta da zafi.
I know exactly where you are going.	Na san ainihin inda za ku.
But it is a big job.	Amma babban aiki ne.
With children.	Tare da yara.
From year to year.	Tun daga shekara yake zuwa.
It is a good food.	Abinci ne mai kyau.
It's a day.	Yana da kwana.
That is the problem.	Wannan ita ce matsalar.
If he runs.	Idan ya gudu.
Obviously, completely wrong.	Babu shakka, gaba ɗaya kuskure.
They will take care of her.	Za su kula da ita.
I think something went up.	Ina tsammanin wani abu ya tashi.
When he did, something appeared above.	Lokacin da ya yi, wani abu ya bayyana a sama.
It's me.	Ni kaina.
Something you need to know.	Wani abu da kuke buƙatar sani.
He will play on his own.	Zai yi wasa da kansa.
This is too much.	Wannan yana da yawa sosai.
I was sick.	Na yi rashin lafiya.
If they are going to take it, that's fine with me.	Idan za su tafi da shi, hakan yayi min.
We hurried in.	Da sauri muka shiga.
So the man lied.	Haka mutumin yayi karya.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
She knew it when.	Ta san shi yaushe.
I am among the best of them.	Ina cikin mafi kyawun su.
I only eat to pass the time.	Ina ci kawai don wuce lokaci.
One knows how it is.	Mutum ya san yadda yake.
But you do not have to do it by hand.	Amma ba lallai ne ku yi shi da hannu ba.
That's the funny thing.	Abin da ke da ban dariya ke nan.
And so it was.	Haka kuma komai ya kasance.
You can do this by yourself.	Kuna iya yin wannan ta hanyar ku.
I have one.	Ina da wani.
Have you tried this?	Shin kun gwada wannan?
Works great.	Aiki sosai.
This time it will happen.	Wannan lokacin zai faru.
You helped.	Kun taimaka.
It is a statement of truth.	Magana ce ta gaskiya.
He will not get help there.	Ba zai sami taimako a can ba.
Perhaps that upset the athlete.	Wataƙila hakan ya bata wa ɗan wasan rai rai.
It always has, will always be.	Koyaushe yana da, koyaushe zai kasance.
Many of you got it right.	Da yawa kun samu daidai.
That sounds like a good opportunity.	Wannan yana kama da dama mai kyau.
They don't even have such thoughts.	Ba su ma da irin wannan tunanin.
The talk was interesting.	Magana ta kasance mai ban sha'awa.
You want to be with them.	Kuna so ku kasance tare da su.
You will not hear.	Ba za ku ji ba.
I didn’t trust myself at first.	Ban yarda da kaina ba da farko.
Of course, that may be because this is something new.	Tabbas, hakan na iya zama saboda wannan sabon abu ne.
Maybe you will be fine.	Wataƙila za ku kasance lafiya.
He and I.	Ya da ni.
Maybe a drink will help.	Wataƙila abin sha zai taimaka.
Not for another week.	Ba don wani mako ba.
Or writing this is scary.	Ko rubuta wannan abin ban tsoro ne.
I have to change.	Dole ne in canza.
I'm scared, please help!	Ina tsoro, don Allah a taimaka!
Perhaps that is what happened today.	Wataƙila abin da ya faru a yau ya canza hakan.
I did not go to the police.	Ban je wurin 'yan sanda ba.
I will not do it.	Ba zan yi ba.
He does not say.	Ba ya cewa.
Some people change us.	Wasu mutane ne ke canza mu.
Even better maybe.	Har ma da kyau watakila.
You will be greatly tested.	Za a gwada ku sosai.
Everyone is happy, and everyone is happy.	Kowa yana farin ciki, kuma yana farin ciki.
He bought a nice new home.	Ya sayi sabon gida mai kyau.
Maybe this is the way to buy time.	Wataƙila wannan shine hanyar siyan lokaci.
The rest of the world certainly loves him.	Babu shakka sauran duniya suna son shi.
He can be a difficult person.	Zai iya zama mutum mai wahala.
He did not give up on himself very much.	Bai yadda da kansa sosai.
I want you to come home soon.	Ina so ku zo gidan nan da nan.
Hope you enjoyed lunch.	Da fatan kun ji daɗin abincin rana.
The train passed slowly.	Jirgin ya wuce a hankali.
I have no money to pay for help anymore.	Ba ni da wani kuɗin da zan biya don taimako kuma.
He did not know only himself.	Bai sani ba da kansa kawai.
He was surprised by this.	Yayi mamakin wannan.
This is not going to happen.	Wannan ba zai faru ba.
Mindful thinking.	Tunani mai hankali.
There is no need to kill them.	Babu bukatar kashe su.
We did our job.	Mun yi aikin mu.
Hard water, perhaps.	Ruwa mai wuya, watakila.
If you can imagine that.	Idan za ku iya tunanin haka.
Not so anymore.	Ba haka ba ne kuma.
I began to see how things would work out together.	Na fara ganin yadda abin zai zo tare.
We often ate together.	Sau da yawa muna cin abinci tare.
Now we have almost.	A yanzu muna da kusan.
This worked really well for me.	Wannan ya yi mini aiki sosai.
I think it was.	Ina tsammanin ya kasance.
I have seen this a lot.	Na ga wannan da yawa.
There is more to life than food.	Akwai da yawa ga rayuwa fiye da abinci.
Many people have children.	Mutane da yawa suna da yara.
This restaurant offers good food.	Wannan gidan cin abinci yana ba da abinci mai kyau.
She did.	Ta yi haka.
Unknown.	Wanda ba a san shi ba.
They feel it is not much.	Suna jin ba shi da yawa.
It feels good to be tired.	Ya ji dadi na gaji.
Somehow we got into it thinking we could.	Ko ta yaya muka shiga ciki muna tunanin za mu iya.
I can not accept that no one will help.	Ba zan iya yarda cewa babu wanda zai taimaka.
Great winners are not happy.	Babban masu nasara ba sa jin daɗi.
But the night was harder.	Amma dare ya fi wuya.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
He still wants so much, so much, in spite of everything.	Har yanzu yana so sosai, da yawa, duk da komai.
Of course I will make every effort.	Tabbas zan yi kowane ƙoƙari.
By the way we need.	Ta hanyar da muke bukata.
But that's a lot.	Amma wannan yawa.
They talk through us.	Suna magana ta wurin mu.
Tell her.	Fada mata.
They are here tonight.	Nan suke a daren yau.
I have bought you many.	Na taba siyan ku da yawa.
You want me to do it.	Kun so in yi.
I came up with the article.	Na zo da labarin.
But you know.	Amma ku sun sani.
He will not go home.	Ba zai je gida ba.
You know why you do that.	Kun san dalilin da yasa kuke haka.
You will get a little out of the right.	Za ku sami kaɗan daga dama.
We make it happy.	Mu sanya shi farin ciki.
You may have seen these.	Wataƙila kun ga waɗannan.
The police came.	'Yan sanda suka zo.
Personally I have nothing to show for it.	Ni kaina babu abin da zan nuna.
It would be better if you heard this from them.	Zai fi kyau idan kun ji wannan daga gare su.
Little did they know it was a little louder.	Ba su sani ba yana da ɗan ƙara kaɗan.
It is easy to forget to show the final answer.	Yana da sauƙi a manta don nuna amsa ta ƙarshe.
It looks a little weird.	Ya yi kama da ɗan ban mamaki.
It feels too much.	Ji ya yi yawa.
It was just a problem.	Ya kasance kawai matsala.
Maybe he wouldn't get pregnant.	Wataƙila da ba zai yi ciki ba.
Second safe.	Na biyu lafiya.
Seeing this, she asked me what was going on.	Ta gani, ta tambaye ni me ke faruwa.
He can’t protect me, and he can’t.	Ba zai iya kare ni ba, kuma ba zai iya ba.
All the while, I was waiting there.	Duk lokacin, ina jira a can.
I just stopped eating.	Kawai na daina cin abinci.
First day at work.	Rana ta farko a wurin aiki.
Every day.	Kowace rana.
Now we no longer need you.	Yanzu ba mu da sauran bukatar ku.
It did not go out immediately.	Bata fita nan take ba.
I'll pass.	Zan wuce.
But it must.	Amma dole.
Someone can read your thoughts.	Wani zai iya karanta tunanin ku.
No one remembers anything.	Babu wanda ya tuna komai.
He spent time and money on this project.	Ya kashe lokaci da kudi a wannan aikin.
Prove it.	Tabbatar da shi.
They will see if they are ready.	Za su gani idan sun shirya.
You say you don't want that to happen.	Kun ce ba ku son hakan ta faru.
Catch.	A kama.
The timing was good for me.	Lokaci yayi min kyau.
Can play inside and out.	Iya wasa ciki da waje.
Think you guys.	Tunanin ku mutane.
I can even myself.	Zan iya ko da kaina.
We want to help you.	Muna son taimaka muku.
No, they do not really know each other, but they do know each other.	A'a, a gaskiya ba su san juna ba, amma sun san juna.
She loves to read and travel.	Tana son karatu da tafiya.
Inside the people.	Ciki kan mutane.
Run fast.	Gudu da sauri.
I tried reading some.	Na gwada karanta wasu.
He began to feel better	Ya fara jin dadi
He knows how to do it well.	Ya san yadda zai yi da kyau.
I look forward to working with you.	Ina fatan yin aiki tare da ku.
We’ve got some, but that’s hard.	Mun sami wasu, amma wannan yana da wahala.
The police came.	'Yan sanda sun zo.
This or that.	Wannan ko babu.
I can't call until now.	Ba zan iya kira ba sai yanzu.
And even this is never guaranteed.	Kuma ko da wannan bai taba tabbata ba.
Second, it is fast paced.	Na biyu, yana da sauri da sauri.
They just have each other.	Suna da juna kawai.
Nothing before the man.	Babu komai kafin mutumin.
It will happen.	Zai faru.
I think he came back alone.	Ina ganin ya dawo shi kadai.
The one above killed her instantly.	Wanda na sama ya kashe ta nan take.
But people are used to it.	Amma mutane sun saba da shi.
I get there.	Ina isa wurin.
I'm really scared.	Ina jin tsoro da gaske.
We called for help but there was no answer.	Mun yi kira don neman taimako amma babu amsa.
As it is, no one will ever love him.	Yadda yake, babu wanda zai taɓa son shi.
We did it together.	Mun yi shi tare.
Not seen.	Ba a gani.
They do not want you to know anything about them.	Ba sa son ka san komai game da su.
But it certainly does.	Amma tabbas yana yi.
They finished work early.	Sun gama aiki da wuri.
We must keep that in mind.	Dole ne mu tuna da hakan.
We will decide what is going on there.	Za mu yanke shawarar abin da ke faruwa a can.
But he used me so much that he did not want to use me again.	Amma ya yi amfani da ni har bai so ya sake amfani da ni ba.
The desire to travel the world.	Sha'awar tafiya duniya.
It should just say.	Kamata yayi kawai yace.
It was planned ahead of time.	An shirya shi kafin lokaci.
You two.	Ku biyu.
I can reach them well and pay for everything.	Zan iya isa gare su da kyau kuma in biya komai.
The work is already hot.	Aikin ya riga ya yi zafi.
Off you go and do it.	Kashe ka je ka yi.
Please help remove this from the game.	Da fatan za a taimaka cire wannan daga wasan.
He has been coming for a long time.	Ya dade yana zuwa.
I returned to work	Na dawo bakin aiki
Someone must know.	Dole ne wani ya sani.
Do too much.	Yi yawa da yawa.
And you won.	Kuma kun ci nasara.
Very good at that.	Yayi kyau sosai a hakan.
It's hard to get down near you.	Yana da wuya a kasa kusa da ku.
We ran, ran, ran.	Mun gudu, gudu, gudu.
He wants to help them.	Yana so ya taimake su.
Some have heard it.	Wasu sun ji labarin.
Lots of money.	Kuɗi mai yawa.
It took me a while.	Ya ɗauki ni ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
There is absolutely nothing they can do for him.	Lallai babu abin da za su iya yi masa.
It is better to do without it.	Gara a yi ba tare da shi ba.
Incidentally we seem to have found this error.	Ya faru muna da alama mun sami wannan kuskure.
This is it.	Wannan shi ne.
We live.	Muna rayuwa.
Or wait until tomorrow morning.	Ko kuma a jira sai gobe da safe.
I'll bring you another coffee.	Zan kawo muku wani kofi.
One thing, however, remains.	Abu daya, duk da haka, ya kasance.
He does not expect any problems.	Ba ya tsammanin wata matsala.
Now he has to stand on the car.	Yanzu dole ya tsaya akan motar.
Many women are gone.	Mata da yawa sun tafi.
Best for success.	Mafi kyau ga nasara.
No more can be found.	Ba za a iya samun ƙarin ba.
She could say he cared for them.	Ta iya cewa yana kula da su.
There is a better time.	Da akwai lokaci mafi kyau.
Run, run as fast as you can.	Gudu, gudu kamar yadda za ku iya.
You had better start thinking.	Gara ka fara tunani.
Out of service.	Ba ya aiki.
No one is enough to help me with it.	Babu wanda ya isa ya taimake ni da shi.
I'm sorry about that.	Na yi hakuri da hakan.
He kept these thoughts to himself.	Ya ajiye wa kansa waɗannan tunanin.
It makes you wonder who got through this.	Yana sa ka yi mamakin wanda ya samu ta wannan.
You are greatly needed.	Ana buƙatar ku sosai.
This however is not interesting to you.	Wannan duk da haka ba shi da ban sha'awa a gare ku.
There is no such thing.	Babu wani abu kamar haka.
Myself is right.	Kaina yayi gaskiya.
This is useful in the future.	Wannan yana da amfani a nan gaba.
These will be difficult, but there is	Waɗannan za su yi wahala, amma akwai
He is tired.	Ya gaji.
But she seemed like years.	Amma ta zama kamar shekaru.
They just need to remove something, heat to eat.	Suna buƙatar kawai cire wani abu, zafi su ci.
I will not do it.	Ba zan yi ba.
If they are.	Idan sun kasance.
There is nothing to eat.	Babu abin da za a ci.
Please stay safe.	Don Allah a zauna lafiya.
No one came to see what was happening.	Ba wanda ya zo ya ga abin da ke faruwa.
He will not be in the house.	Ba zai kasance a gidan ba.
She can help here.	Za ta iya taimaka a nan.
For some people, it may not come a month early.	Ga wasu mutane, ba zai iya zuwa wata ɗaya da wuri ba.
We know each other very well.	Mun san juna sosai.
Probably not.	Wataƙila ba ku yi ba.
But it did a great job.	Amma ya yi babban aiki.
So far, however, this has never happened.	Har zuwa yanzu, duk da haka, wannan bai taɓa faruwa ba.
I have a cold.	Na yi sanyi sosai.
On and on.	A da kuma a kan.
I don't want to kill you myself.	Bana son kashe ka da kaina.
I give more, not a little more interesting.	Ina ba da ƙarin, ba ɗan ban sha'awa ba.
We learned to enjoy travel.	Mun koyi jin daɗin tafiya.
She has one daughter.	Tana da 'ya daya.
Wait here, please.	Jira a nan, don Allah.
Do not let them succeed.	Kada ku bari su ci nasara.
He never sat down.	Bai taba zaune ba.
This is just a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne kawai.
People are afraid to ask for help.	Mutane suna tsoron neman taimako.
I had to leave immediately.	Dole na fita daga nan nan take.
I know where everyone lives.	Na san inda kowa ke zaune.
He is the last.	Shi ne na karshen.
It is something she does not usually do.	Abu ne da ba ta saba yi ba.
Don't buy though.	Kada ku saya ko da yake.
I told for the rest of the material.	Na fada don sauran kayan.
He did it again.	Ya sake yi.
Nothing more, believe me.	Babu wani abu kuma, yarda da ni.
Everything you said is true.	Duk abin da ka fada gaskiya ne.
He just sits there.	Zaune yake kawai.
I was not ready.	Ban shirya ba.
Don’t stop at the ceremony.	Kada ku tsaya kan bikin.
Whatever you think.	Duk abin da kuke tunani.
I can't sign in yet.	Ba zan iya shiga ba tukuna.
But otherwise, they are just two.	Amma in ba haka ba, su biyu ne kawai.
Nothing in the whole world is amazing.	Babu wani abu a duk duniya da yake ban mamaki.
He responded quickly.	Ya amsa da sauri.
I was surprised and happy.	Na yi mamaki da farin ciki.
It is better but still needs more time.	Ya fi kyau amma har yanzu yana buƙatar ƙarin lokaci.
You see only what you want.	Kuna ganin abin da kuke so kawai.
Time itself will be weak.	Lokaci da kansa zai yi rauni.
I'll show you now.	Zan nuna maka yanzu.
Many women have nothing.	Mata da yawa ba su da komai.
We left before it was over.	Mun tafi kafin a gama.
I'm tired twice.	Na gaji sau biyu.
Real life story.	Labarin rayuwa na gaske.
We will eat together.	Za mu ci abinci tare.
I'll have a chance on it.	Zan samu dama a kai.
Sometimes people and other things also appear.	Wani lokaci mutane da wasu abubuwa kuma suna bayyana.
Do not read too much.	Kada ku karanta su da yawa.
We have a job.	Muna da aikin yi.
There is no such consent.	Babu irin wannan yarda.
Next time, he tells himself.	Lokaci na gaba, ya gaya wa kansa.
And it will not be done.	Kuma ba za a yi ba.
But it was too late.	Amma ya kusa makara.
But don't waste my time.	Amma kar a bata lokaci na.
I think that would be good.	Ina tsammanin hakan zai yi kyau.
He has no doubt about that.	Ba shi da shakka a kan haka.
I do not remember the exact date.	Ban tuna ainihin ranar ba.
That's what he says.	Abin da yake faɗa ke nan.
That requires effort.	Hakan yana buƙatar ƙoƙari.
It is useless to do so.	Ba ya da amfani yin hakan.
He opened them wide.	Ya bude su sosai.
You have to think carefully.	Dole ne ku yi tunani a hankali.
I do not know what will happen.	Ban san abin da zai faru ba.
But then things changed.	Amma sai abubuwa suka canza.
I'm not saying there's anything in that.	Ba na cewa akwai wani abu a cikin wannan.
Get the best you can.	Samun mafi kyawun abin da za ku iya.
We do not know what they want.	Ba mu san abin da suke so ba.
The longer we wait, the longer we wait.	Idan muka dade muna jira, sai da muka dade.
I'm there you know.	Ina can ka sani.
Of course, that will never happen.	Tabbas hakan ba zai taba faruwa ba.
I bought a new house.	Na sayi sabon gida.
If you do not hear, you can see.	Idan ba ku ji ba, kuna iya gani.
Victory!	Nasara!
Try it on something that won't bother you yet.	Gwada shi akan wani abu da ba zai damu ba tukuna.
They did not speak, at least not yet.	Ba su magana, ko kadan bai bayyana haka ba.
We can't live together.	Ba za mu iya rayuwa tare ba.
No one does.	Babu mai yi.
If she could, she didn't want to hear it again.	Idan za ta iya, ba ta so ta sake jin haka.
We cannot say that we will ever see that.	Ba za mu iya cewa za mu taba ganin haka ba.
Now he's gone.	Yanzu ya tafi.
But for me it was right.	Amma a gare ni daidai ne.
In fact I think he decided he would not give me an answer.	A gaskiya ina ganin ya yanke shawarar ba zai ba ni amsa ba.
He will try it.	Zai gwada shi.
I hurried back.	Na yi sauri na koma.
She never spoke to him.	Bata taba yi masa magana ba.
She wanted an answer.	Ta so amsa.
It's not even funny.	Ba ma abin dariya ba ne.
You can tell me anything.	Kuna iya gaya mani komai.
I did not hear that.	Ban ji haka ba.
I don't have time to get sick.	Ba ni da lokacin rashin lafiya.
They do not guarantee anything.	Ba sa tabbatar da komai.
No, we're going to start out a little bit.	A'a, za mu fara fita kadan kadan.
There are so many things going on.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ke faruwa.
I don't want anything.	Ba na son komai .
No one gave him much attention.	Babu wanda ya ba shi hankali sosai.
You have met him.	Ku sun hadu da shi.
Now we get it.	Yanzu mun samu.
Do not try to eat.	Kada ku yi ƙoƙarin cin abinci.
One is never enough.	Daya bai taba isa ba.
It can be confirmed quickly.	Ana iya tabbatar da shi da sauri.
I was happy to be.	Na yi farin ciki da zama.
I will accept that.	Zan yarda da hakan.
It's there, of course.	Yana can, ba shakka.
I should write someone about it.	Ya kamata in rubuta wani game da shi.
I'm not really sure anyone can.	Ban tabbata da gaske wani zai iya ba.
I will not tell you.	Ba zan gaya muku ba.

Great surprise there.	Babban abin mamaki a can.
We have to work to do that.	Ya kamata mu yi aiki don yin haka.
No really, really can't.	A'a da gaske, da gaske ba zai iya ba.
The material is amazing.	Kayan yana da ban mamaki.
I do not want to leave.	Ba na neman barin.
In the past, he said changing the world.	A baya, yana cewa canza duniya.
I read Readers like this.	Na karanta ƴan karatu kamar haka.
This is why, in general, they seem to be more comfortable.	Wannan shine dalilin da ya sa, a gaba ɗaya, suna da alama sun fi jin daɗi.
But hot and cold, hot and cold.	Amma zafi da sanyi, zafi da sanyi.
I think so.	Ina tsammanin haka ne.
You have to look good in it.	Dole ne ku yi kyau a ciki.
I really want to touch you.	Ina so in taba ku sosai.
She just wouldn't agree.	Kawai ba za ta yarda ba.
They showed her how to do it.	Suka nuna mata yadda zata yi.
Nothing happened.	Babu wani abin da ya faru.
I didn’t stop to think or think.	Ban tsaya tunani ko tunani ba.
I did something wrong.	Na yi wani abu ba daidai ba.
The main thing is that you are healthy.	Babban abu shine cewa kuna lafiya.
It started to rain.	Aka fara ruwan sama.
No one was seriously injured.	Babu wanda ya samu mummunan rauni.
Maybe you will succeed.	Wataƙila za ku yi nasara.
We can see it coming for almost a year.	Muna iya ganin yana zuwa kusan shekara guda.
She did not travel much.	Ba ta yi tafiya da yawa haka ba.
It's not easy to.	Ba shi da sauƙi don .
No one has a name.	Ba wanda yake da suna.
Get the book in writing.	Samu littafin a rubuta.
I think of suicide all the time.	Ina tunanin kashe kansa koyaushe.
He did not think so.	Bai yi tunanin haka ba.
But how? 	Amma ta yaya?
Something unusual happened that day.	Wani sabon abu ya faru a ranar.
My favorite is.	Abin da na fi so ne.
That's why we went out on the road.	Shi ya sa muka fita kan hanya.
If she gets help, it will not be from him.	Idan ta sami taimako, ba zai kasance daga gare shi ba.
Killed	An kashe
They have two children together.	Suna da yara biyu tare.
You are good to talk about something.	Kai mai kyau ne don yin magana game da wani abu.
Easy to make, but delicious and tasty.	Sauƙi don yin, amma mai daɗi da daɗi.
I do not remember exactly.	Ban tuna daidai ba.
It needs to be saved.	Yana bukatar a ajiye shi.
Now go to work.	Yanzu tafi aiki.
Women and children were seen in the crowd.	An ga mata da yara a cikin taron.
We cannot change the past.	Ba za mu iya canza abin da ya gabata ba.
Such things.	Irin waɗannan abubuwa.
In fact, she is not sure if it is three days.	A gaskiya ba ta da tabbas ko kwana uku kenan.
But really everything is going wrong.	Amma gaskiya komai yana tafiya ba daidai ba.
We did both.	Mun yi duka biyu.
This is a lie.	Wannan karya ce.
We are injured.	Mun ji rauni.
I got up so one day.	Na tashi haka wata rana.
The food at the local restaurant is good.	Abincin a gidan abinci na gida yana da kyau.
He will do that now.	Hakan zai yi a yanzu.
We can assume that there is some truth here.	Za mu iya ɗauka cewa akwai wata gaskiya a nan.
They are just beautiful.	Suna da kyau kawai.
But it will not be so easy.	Amma ba zai kasance mai sauƙi haka ba.
Really? 	Da gaske?
How did he know?	Ta yaya ya sani?
Please accept it please accept it.	Don Allah kar shi don Allah kar shi.
She said.	Ta ce.
I can't say.	Ba zan iya cewa ba.
However, no one wanted to know.	Duk da haka, babu wanda ya so ya sani.
Nothing happened here.	Babu abin da ya faru a nan.
They all wanted to go to the bus station.	Duk suka so zuwa tashar motar.
We succeeded of course.	Mun yi nasara ba shakka.
I know she's right.	Na san ta yi gaskiya.
This is the best thing.	Wannan shi ne mafi kyawun abu.
He could not get out.	Ya kasa fita.
But last night everything changed.	Amma daren jiya ya canza komai.
I don't even feel that way.	Ba na ma jin dadi haka.
I know people do.	Na san mutane suna yi.
They only eat one meal a day.	Suna cin abinci ɗaya kawai a rana.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
I like cold.	Ina son sanyi sanyi.
It must have surprised you.	Dole ne ya sanya ku mamaki.
You will read this just because you are interested.	Za ku karanta wannan kawai saboda kuna sha'awar.
There is no way around it.	Babu wata hanya a kusa da shi.
But this is a big mistake.	Amma wannan babban kuskure ne.
Such a trip every day, really.	Irin tafiya kowace rana, da gaske.
This is another amazing achievement.	Wannan kuma wata nasara ce mai ban mamaki.
He drinks alone.	Shi kadai yake sha.
A sweetness that she will never know again.	Wani dadi irin wanda ba za ta sake sani ba.
I will tell you about it later.	Zan gaya muku game da shi a gaba.
Or the second or third time.	Ko karo na biyu ko na uku.
You are right, the decision is yours to make.	Kun yi gaskiya, shawarar ku ce ku yanke.
He knew immediately that he was home.	Nan take ya san yana gida.
I didn’t ask him about it.	Ban tambaye shi game da shi ba.
And we continue to do so, and we will not stop.	Kuma muna ci gaba da yin haka, kuma ba za mu daina ba.
But for himself only.	Amma ga kansa kawai.
You will never get it.	Ba za ku taba samun shi ba.
I tried, you know.	Na gwada, ka sani.
It will not be the last, but he does not know yet.	Ba zai zama na ƙarshe ba, amma bai sani ba tukuna.
Best answer.	Mafi kyawun amsa.
Not everyone spoke.	Duk mutumin bai yi magana ba.
I encountered a problem.	Na hadu da matsala.
Let’s do a little now and a little bit, they will say.	Bari mu yi kadan yanzu kuma kadan kadan, za su ce.
First without children.	Na farko ba tare da yara ba.
That's just the way things are.	Haka kawai abubuwa suke.
But this is not the case.	Amma wannan ba abu bane.
You do not have to work anymore.	Ba sai ka kara yin aiki ba.
But it is not complete.	Amma bai cika ba.
I don’t feel right, anyway.	Ba na jin daidai, ko ta yaya.
They decided to do it.	Sun yanke shawarar yin hakan.
Honestly I don't understand that statement.	Gaskiya ban fahimci wannan magana ba.
Two who knew the game was up.	Biyu da suka san wasan ya tashi.
Or maybe not for you.	Ko watakila ba don ku ba.
He did not say.	Bai fad'a ba.
I didn't see anyone around.	Ban ga kowa a kusa ba.
But this must be tested.	Amma dole ne a gwada wannan.
And not just a second chance.	Kuma ba kawai wata dama ta biyu ba.
If you really want to do it yourself.	Idan da gaske kuna son yin kanku.
He died for us.	Ya mutu mana.
She did everything she could.	Ta yi duk abin da za ta iya yi.
Not for me.	Ba gare ni ba.
I found myself talking.	Na sami kaina da magana.
He found a suitable place to live.	Ya sami wurin da ya dace ya zauna.
It shows something but it is not enough.	Ya nuna wani abu amma bai isa ba.
He was in time.	Ya kasance a cikin lokaci.
It seems right to me.	Ga alama daidai a gare ni.
But you remember that, now.	Amma kun tuna da wannan, yanzu.
Just what can happen.	Kawai abin da zai iya faruwa.
How long will this unrest continue?	Har yaushe wannan rashin jin daɗi zai ci gaba?
Some know very well.	Wasu sun sani sosai.
She said the same thing.	Ita kuma ta fada kamar haka.
She knew how to talk to her.	Ta san magana da ita.
This new restaurant is a huge success.	Wannan sabon gidan cin abinci babban nasara ne.
I hardly really enjoyed myself.	Da wuya na ji daɗin kaina sosai.
In fact, it is not scary at all.	A gaskiya, ba abin tsoro ba ne ko kaɗan.
That will happen.	Hakan zai faru.
They want to feel good after eating.	Sun so su ji daɗi bayan sun ci.
So go ahead.	Don haka kasa gaba.
I always take care of people now.	Ina kula da mutane koyaushe a yanzu.
I know in fact this works.	Na san a gaskiya wannan yana aiki.
Let's go out and play now.	Mu fita mu yi wasa yanzu.
They don’t like her very much, however.	Ba sa son ta sosai, duk da haka.
I want it to be amazing.	Ina so ya zama abin ban mamaki.
When he was here, we did not remember him.	Lokacin da yake nan, ba mu tuna da shi ba.
Not since lunch yesterday.	Ba tun abincin rana jiya ba.
Everything is gone.	Duk abin ya tafi.
Every day that passes you feel like one day is missing.	Duk ranar da ta wuce sai ka ji an rasa wata rana.
Do not go beyond their knowledge.	Kar a wuce sanin su.
We can talk about this all night if you want.	Za mu iya magana game da wannan duk dare idan kuna so.
That took a lot of work.	Hakan ya dauki aiki mai yawa.
And they keep growing.	Kuma suna ci gaba da girma.
No one can remove it for you.	Babu wanda zai iya cire muku shi.
Everyone is here.	Kowa ya kasance a nan.
This makes them interesting.	Wannan ya sa su zama abin sha'awa.
There is truth in it.	Akwai gaskiya a ciki.
It should not be done.	Bai kamata a yi ba.
He laughs a lot.	Yana yawan dariya.
So I think it was such a success for me.	Don haka ina tsammanin irin wannan nasara ce a gare ni.
Now it will be difficult to continue.	Yanzu zai yi wuya ya ci gaba.
Now, they can probably be right.	Yanzu, tabbas za su iya zama daidai.
These are simple.	Waɗannan su ne masu sauƙi.
The first is the best.	Na farko shine mafi kyau.
There’s a good time here once.	Akwai lokaci mai kyau a nan sau ɗaya.
All of this takes time.	Duk wannan yana ɗaukar lokaci.
There is still no word.	Har yanzu babu magana.
But there is a reason why it is not there anymore.	Amma akwai dalilin da ya sa ba a can kuma.
She was not the type.	Ba ta kasance irin ba.
And he's talking to people there, of course.	Kuma yana magana da mutane a can, ba shakka.
It gives him a beautiful view.	Yana ba shi kyakkyawan gani.
There is good work to be done.	Akwai kyakkyawan aiki don sanin.
Where to smoke?	A ina za a sha taba?
They are left behind.	Ana barin su a baya.
He was happy to buy it for him.	Ya yi farin ciki saya masa.
He did it.	Ya yi shi.
As they say, do not always agree with what you see.	Kamar yadda suke faɗa, kada ku yarda da abin da kuke gani koyaushe.
You have to show up to work.	Dole ne ku nuna don aiki.
He would never be able to get inside.	Ba zai taba iya shiga ciki ba.
She begins to cry.	Ta fara kuka.
I couldn’t think of how to put it on.	Na kasa tunanin yadda zan saka shi.
I hope you have good things.	Ina fatan abubuwa masu kyau.
She did.	Ta yi hakan.
I have them all.	Na da su duka.
Otherwise, we are not serious.	In ba haka ba, ba mu da gaske.
I often thought how it would be.	Na yi tunani sau da yawa yadda zai kasance.
I will try to remember everything you said.	Zan yi ƙoƙari in tuna duk abin da kuka faɗa.
Ease is more difficult.	Sauƙi ya fi wuya.
The day is over.	An gama ranar.
It is so big that it is amazing.	Yana da girma sosai cewa yana da ban mamaki.
Of course this is not true.	Tabbas wannan ba gaskiya bane.
They have been married for a long time.	Sun dade da aure.
It's better with her.	Ya fi kyau da ita.
He was afraid he would not.	Ya ji tsoro kada ya yi.
This is true.	Wannan gaskiya ne.
I need to work with you.	Ina bukata in yi aiki da ku.
Maybe it would be better if it wasn't.	Watakila zata fi kyau idan ba shi ba.
You have a problem now!	Kuna da matsala yanzu!
Developers have long been successful there.	Masu ci gaba sun dade suna cin nasara a can.
Will you like it or not.	Za ku so shi ko ba za ku so ba.
We don't need to see one person.	Ba ma buƙatar ganin wani mutum ɗaya.
I heard that.	Na ji haka.
He would not talk to anyone.	Ba zai yi magana da kowa ba.
But wait.	Amma jira.
So be careful.	Don haka a kula.
That she would never agree to.	Wannan ba za ta taba yarda ba.
Dishonesty abounds here.	Rashin gaskiya yana da yawa a nan.
However, it is difficult.	Duk da haka, yana da wahala.
It was not long at the time.	Bai dade ba a lokacin.
We had a delicious dinner.	Muna cin abincin dare mai daɗi.
But she lost her place to start.	Amma ta rasa ta ina zata fara.
Despite knowing best.	Duk da sanin mafi kyau.
You think it's a game.	Kuna tsammanin wasa ne.
However, he failed to eat.	Duk da haka, ya kasa ci.
They are not activated.	Ba kunna su ba.
I failed to do so.	Na kasa da wannan.
I can't do this.	Ba zan iya yin wannan ba.
There it is.	Akwai shi.
I did not request this.	Ban nemi wannan ba.
Looking forward.	Neman gaba.
There were too many people.	Mutane sun yi yawa.
They took me to the water.	Sun kai ni ruwa.
There is not much in it.	Babu abu mai yawa a ciki.
Then everything changed.	Daga nan komai ya canza.
Everyone can see that.	Kowa na iya ganin haka.
People want more.	Mutane suna son ƙarin.
This has none.	Wannan ba shi da ko ɗaya.
It does not take much attention.	Ba ya ɗaukar hankali sosai.
We cannot catch ourselves in a weak moment.	Ba za mu iya kama mu a cikin lokaci mai rauni ba.
She never believed the truth.	Ba ta taba yarda da gaskiya ba.
It's too late today.	Ya sake makara yau.
Fear of something new.	Tsoron sabon abu.
They knew something he did not know, something about himself.	Sun san wani abu da bai sani ba, wani abu game da kansa.
A small amount of food is required.	Ana buƙatar kaɗan na kayan abinci.
But nothing new happened.	Amma babu wani sabon abu da ya faru.
Check it out now below.	Kalli shi yanzu a kasa.
He chooses.	Ya ga dama.
We want to have more people.	Muna so mu sami ƙarin mutane.
That did not work well.	Hakan bai yi kyau ba.
The rest of the article is edited, as follows.	An shirya sauran labarin, kamar haka.
In fact, it even makes us a little older.	A gaskiya ma, har ma yana sa mu ɗan girma.
But it will be fine.	Amma zai yi kyau.
God never spoke.	Allah ya taba magana.
And keep thinking.	Kuma ku ci gaba da tunani.
I really enjoyed it.	Na ji daɗi sosai.
Some work better than others.	Wasu suna aiki mafi kyau fiye da wasu.
I have a lot of other things to do.	Ina da wasu abubuwa da dama da zan yi.
Please, let's talk about it later.	Don Allah, bari mu yi magana game da shi a gaba.
They just left it.	Sun bar shi kawai.
I want to say something.	Ina so in ce wani abu.
Maybe, maybe we can.	Wataƙila, watakila za mu iya.
Maybe she found this out or discovered it.	Wataƙila ta gano wannan ko kuma ta gano shi.
This is how it is.	Wannan shi ne yadda abin yake.
He is still seriously injured.	Har yanzu ya ji rauni sosai.
He could not come up with the name.	Ya kasa fito da sunan.
I only know where she is, you see.	Ni kadai na san inda take, ka gani.
People know this stuff when they hear it, he said.	Mutane sun san wannan kayan idan sun ji shi, in ji shi.
By this time tomorrow will be over.	Zuwa wannan lokaci gobe za a gama.
I was just.	Na kasance kawai.
To show that they live together will be even more difficult.	Don nuna cewa suna zaune tare zai fi wuya.
But this never happened.	Amma wannan bai taba faruwa ba.
I feel things.	Ina jin abubuwa.
I'm coming to him.	Ina zuwa gare shi.
It should stop at the port.	Ya kamata ya tsaya a cikin tashar jirgin ruwa.
The mind is weak.	Hankali ya kasance rauni.
Some of them have already arrived.	Wasu daga ciki sun riga sun zo.
But now we should miss it.	Amma yanzu ya kamata mu rasa shi.
He should not have succeeded and knew.	Bai kamata ya ci nasara ba kuma ya sani.
What she said.	Abin da ta ce.
But the film wants to be that way.	Amma ana son fim ɗin ya zama haka.
Some can tell us all this.	Wasu za su iya gaya mana duk wannan.
Just keep living.	Ci gaba da rayuwa kawai.
The task was simple.	Aikin ya zama mai sauƙi.
But this room will not do.	Amma wannan dakin ba zai yi ba.
It just started.	An fara kawai.
I'm glad he was happy about that.	Na yi farin ciki ya yi farin ciki da hakan.
Nothing is planned.	Ba a shirya komai ba.
And he never got it.	Kuma bai taba samu ba.
I remember the first one well.	Na tuna da na farko da kyau.
It first appeared.	An fara bayyana.
That will do.	Hakan zai yi.
At every call.	A kowane kira.
This is just fun.	Wannan abin farin ciki ne kawai.
It's just the sun, that's all.	Rana ce kawai, shi ke nan.
And you're annoying me.	Kuma kana bata min rai.
I saw it pass.	Na ga ya wuce.
One cannot be right.	Mutum ba zai iya zama daidai ba.
But there seems to be something in it.	Amma da alama akwai wani abu a tare da shi.
You must know that.	Lallai ne ku san hakan.
I don't want to make this trip.	Ba na son yin wannan tafiya.
Maybe it's good.	Wataƙila yana da kyau.
They know everything about this.	Sun san komai game da wannan.
She has no reason to lie.	Ba ta da dalilin yin karya.
Now no.	Yanzu babu.
What is wrong with you?	Me yake tare da ku.
She must know.	Dole ta sani.
In fact, we find that this is not necessarily the case.	A gaskiya, mun gano cewa wannan ba lallai ba ne.
Just let me die.	Kawai bari in mutu.
He has done things like this before.	Ya taba yin abubuwa kamar haka a baya.
Talk to him first.	Yi masa magana tukuna.
That's why we flew.	Shi ya sa muka tashi sama.
But not like before.	Amma ba kamar da ba.
But all this time probably paid off.	Amma duk wannan lokacin tabbas ya biya.
They try, but it does not work.	Suna ƙoƙari, amma ba ya aiki.
I am my own person now.	Ni mutumin kaina ne yanzu.
Everything is fine, everything is fine.	Komai yayi kyau, komai yayi kyau.
They will not let us down.	Ba za su bar mu kusa ba.
I doubt they would like it if they could.	Ina shakka za su so idan za su iya.
This is just a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne kawai.
People are fighting over it.	Mutane suna fada a kai.
The second time around it feels really hard.	Lokaci na biyu a kusa yana jin da wuya sosai.
I spoke.	Na yi magana.
It protects you.	Yana kare ku.
I'm not feeling well.	Ban ji dadi ba.
Let me try it somehow.	Bari in gwada ta wata hanya.
You are in the past, aren't you?	Kun kasance a baya, ko ba haka ba?
You are trying to protect them.	Kuna ƙoƙarin kare su.
I even told the girls that.	Har na gaya wa 'yan mata na cewa.
You are closed.	Kun rufe.
And no one did anything about it.	Kuma babu wanda ya yi wani abu game da shi.
You have to work again.	Dole ne ku yi aiki kuma.
This is a simple matter.	Wannan abu ne mai sauƙi.
I don't want to do that.	Ba na son yin hakan.
Enjoyment and enjoyment of the project.	Jin daɗin sha'awa da jin daɗin aikin.
No one wants to miss the event.	Babu wanda yake son rasa taron.
And you will be honest, they are not many.	Kuma za ku yi gaskiya, ba su da yawa.
Yet it is one of the two mistakes.	Amma duk da haka yana daya daga cikin kuskure biyu.
I did not answer.	Ban ba da amsa ba.
I have no one in the world to go to.	Ba ni da kowa a duniya da zan je.
I don't know how it happened, but it happened.	Ban san yadda hakan ya faru ba, amma ya faru.
She did well tonight.	Ta yi kyau a daren nan.
And eat something.	Kuma ku ci wani abu.
Maybe we can stay there.	Wataƙila za mu iya zama a can.
But it is true.	Amma yana da gaskiya.
I can't save the book.	Ba zan iya ajiye littafin ba.
You know, that's just great.	Ka sani, wanda kawai mai girma ne.
It was a bad weekend for him.	Ya kasance mummunan karshen mako a gare shi.
She advised him to start working early.	Ta ba shi shawarar ya fara aiki da wuri.
That happened a lot at the time.	Hakan ya faru da yawa a lokacin.
I was arrested for sure.	An kama ni tabbas.
Today he does.	Yau yana yi.
She should not say anything.	Bai kamata ta ce komai ba.
He will remember that.	Zai tuna da haka.
There is not much to do.	Babu wani abu da yawa da za a yi.
Now it was time to end the trip.	Yanzu lokaci ya yi da za a gama tafiya.
We never said that.	Ba mu taba cewa haka ba.
You hear things.	Kuna jin abubuwa.
If appropriate, take it with you.	Idan ya dace, tafi da shi.
To live of course, eat.	Don rayuwa ba shakka, ci.
I wondered what the problem was.	Na yi mamakin menene matsalar.
I will make you sleep.	Zan sa ku ji barci.
There is nothing you can do about it now.	Babu wani abu da za ku iya yi game da shi yanzu.
All or nothing, he said.	Duk ko babu, in ji shi.
Say you are sure.	Ka ce ka tabbata.
I do not know what to think.	Ban san abin da zan yi tunani ba.
Or how to get out of it.	Ko yadda ake fita daga ciki.
Not too hot.	Ba zafi mai yawa ba.
He knew it was not what he wanted.	Ya san ba abin da yake so ba ne.
See what happens.	Kalli me ya faru.
Some even go to the next world.	Wasu ma sun wuce zuwa duniya ta gaba.
But this is better than working.	Amma wannan ya fi kyau fiye da aiki.
It seems that more is needed.	Da alama ba lallai ba ne a kawo ƙarin.
That is the main thing right now.	Wannan shine babban abu a yanzu.
There is so much to do.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a yi.
She wants to know how to protect him.	Tana son sanin yadda za ta kare shi.
Not one.	Ba guda ɗaya ba.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Ba abin da ya fi wannan.
They found him walking.	Sun samu yana tafiya.
Time is running out!	Lokaci yayi da girma!
Even at night he did not sleep.	Ko da dare bai yi barci ba.
I looked around.	Na duba kusa.
No one knew she was surprised.	Ba wanda ya san ta ya yi mamaki.
I was that kind of person.	Na kasance irin mutumin nan.
This can make her look really good.	Wannan zai iya yi mata kyau sosai.
Do not be optimistic.	Kar ku kasance da kyakkyawan fata.
I have never liked any such problem.	Ban taɓa son kowace irin wannan matsala ba.
But please just do this one thing for me.	Amma don Allah kawai ku yi mini wannan abu ɗaya.
He does not want to come here.	Baya son zuwa nan.
We can't answer that.	Ba za mu iya amsa wannan ba.
It should have happened to you.	Ya dace ya faru da ku .
He saw what happened.	Ya ga abin da ya faru.
The plane carries a lot.	Jirgin jirgin sama yana ɗauka da yawa.
In hand.	A hannu.
Lying is not allowed.	Ba a yarda da yin karya.
They came out really well.	Sun fito sosai.
Do not tell her.	Kar ka gaya mata.
Maybe she didn't come.	Watakila ba ta zo ba.
They are looking for opportunities.	Suna neman dama.
I laugh, you laugh.	Ina dariya, kuna dariya.
Let her rejoice.	Bari ta yi farin ciki.
This is good to see.	Wannan yana da kyau a gani.
So I work both and every day.	Don haka ina aiki duka kuma kowace rana.
He is there.	Yana can.
Maybe he really likes you.	Wataƙila yana son ku sosai.
They are so beautiful.	Suna da kyau sosai.
I don't talk to anyone.	Ba na magana da kowa.
All we have to do now is work.	Abin da ya kamata mu yi yanzu shi ne mu yi aiki.
Otherwise, it is more than that.	Ban da haka, ya fi haka.
She drank coffee alone.	Ta sha kofi ita kadai.
It is true, of course.	Yana da gaskiya, ba shakka.
The road seems empty.	Hanyar kamar babu kowa.
I can't wait to try it out.	Ba zan iya jira don gwada shi ba.
Please tell me.	Don Allah, gaya mani.
Some say good.	Wasu suna cewa da kyau.
There is no home to be seen.	Babu wani gida a gani.
I like this car.	Ina son wannan motar.
Are you sure you know what you are doing?	Kun tabbata kun san abin da kuke yi?
I feel what it feels like.	Ina jin abin da yake ji.
In the end though, it works so well.	A ƙarshe ko da yake, yana aiki don haka komai.
Do everything right.	Yi komai daidai.
Less, if anything.	Kadan, idan wani abu.
That would be difficult.	Hakan zai yi wuya.
Nor did they.	Haka kuma ba su yi ba.
See, this is the problem when you want to travel.	Duba, wannan shine matsalar lokacin da kuke son tafiya.
It is well prepared.	An shirya sosai.
Of course I did something right.	Tabbas na yi wani abu daidai.
Sorry to see you go.	Yi hakuri da ganin ka tafi.
The good thing is what happens next.	Kyakkyawan abu shine abin da ya faru a gaba.
You are not looking for anything.	Ba ku neman komai.
That is a fact.	Wannan gaskiya ce.
They love fish.	Suna son kifi.
That proved successful.	Hakan ya tabbatar da nasara.
Somehow, it works now.	Ko ta yaya, yana aiki yanzu.
I don't care about them.	Ban damu da su ba.
He loved it and could not wait to return.	Ya so shi kuma ya kasa jira ya koma.
I was very involved.	Na kasance da hannu sosai.
I want to go.	Ina so in je.
But he was not paid that way.	Amma ba a biya shi haka ba.
He is still here.	Har yanzu yana nan.
I know you will not come.	Na san ba za ku zo ba.
You can re-read the above.	Kuna iya sake karanta abin da ke sama.
They just don’t look like you.	Su kawai ba su yi kama da ku ba.
He worked on his own until he died.	Ya yi aiki da kansa har ya mutu.
No, it's just going out.	A'a, fita kawai ke nan.
He killed the game and all.	Ya kashe wasan da duka.
He is one of the food vendors.	Yana daya daga cikin masu sayar da kayan abinci.
This is a very simple process.	Wannan hanya ce mai sauƙi mai sauƙi.
The next day.	Rana mai zuwa.
You too.	Kai ma.
Now what to do ?.	Yanzu me za a yi?.
They worked together once.	Sun yi aiki tare sau ɗaya.
But everyone around her is right about both.	Amma duk wanda ke kusa da ita yana da gaskiya game da duka.
I can not reach him.	Ba zan iya zuwa gare shi ba.
Ask what else we can help you do.	Tambayi me kuma za mu iya taimaka muku yi.
He did not catch her.	Bai kama ta ba.
We can cover this now.	Za mu iya rufe wannan a yanzu.
I do not know what to do.	Ban san me zan yi ba.
I'm trying	Ina ƙoƙari
That has to stop.	Wannan dole ya tsaya.
Continue whatever food they are given that is healthy.	Ci gaba da duk abin da aka ba su abinci cewa yana da lafiya.
But, it still hasn’t worked.	Amma, har yanzu bai yi aiki ba.
Everything is now.	Komai ne yanzu.
We do not need more.	Ba ma buƙatar ƙarin.
There will be no one to pass them by.	Ba za a sami wanda zai wuce su ba.
That's all.	Shi ke nan duka.
I tried to sleep, but failed.	Na yi ƙoƙarin yin barci, amma na kasa.
But we did nothing.	Amma ba mu yi komai ba.
I'm not as hard as they say.	Ba ni da wuya kamar yadda suka ce.
Look, you can't think of anything.	Duba, ba za ku iya tunanin komai ba.
He decided he would not return.	Ya yanke shawarar ba zai dawo ba.
But to no avail.	Amma ba wani amfani.
I really like traveling.	Ina son tafiya sosai.
He began to give them to me.	Sai ya fara bani su.
Of course you do not have to suffer.	Tabbas babu bukatar ku wahala.
Write your name here.	Rubuta sunan ku a nan.
She did not recognize me.	Ba ta gane ni ba.
There is a lot of water.	Akwai ruwa mai yawa.
But no such thing is happening.	Amma babu irin wannan da ke faruwa.
I was surprised by this.	Na yi mamakin wannan.
I do not understand.	Bata gane ba.
I love him.	Ina son shi.
I think they did not.	Ina ganin ba su yi ba.
I wrote	Na rubuta
Keep touching it.	Ci gaba taba shi.
It cannot be true.	Ba zai iya zama gaskiya ba.
She tried several times, but nothing happened.	Ta gwada sau da yawa, amma ba abin da ya faru.
God, hates this man.	Allah, ya ƙi wannan mutumin.
I'm running.	Ina gudu.
And we have a job.	Kuma muna da aikin yi.
No one was interested.	Babu wanda ya yi sha'awar.
Right now, you are exactly where you should be.	A yanzu, kuna daidai inda ya kamata ku kasance.
For me, she was about to live again.	A gare ni, ta kusa sake rayuwa.
You won’t see that, though.	Ba za ku ga haka ba, ko da yake.
He was, in fact, the only player.	Ya kasance, a lafiya, ɗan wasa shi kaɗai.
What a great booklet.	Abin da babban ɗan littafin.
I started running.	Na fara gudu.
It makes it even more interesting.	Yana sa ya fi ban sha'awa.
You say he made a mistake.	Kun ce ya yi kuskure.
It is raining a lot.	Ruwan sama yayi yawa.
Fear of what he might hear, or what he would hear.	Tsoron abin da zai iya ji, ko abin da zai ji shi.
He admits that the food tastes good.	Ya yarda cewa abincin yayi dadi.
I can make this work for you.	Zan iya sa wannan aiki a gare ku.
But, don’t worry that, she’s up ?.	Amma, kada ka damu da cewa, ta tashi?.
He walks and walks.	Tafiya yayi yana tafiya.
If it comes back broken, you know it is completely invisible.	Idan ya dawo karya, kun san gaba daya ba a gani.
I prepared lunch as a child.	Na shirya abincin rana ina yaro.
Until then, there is nothing you can do.	Har sai lokacin, babu wani abin da za ku iya yi.
Do not be afraid.	Kada ku ji tsoro.
The door is closed.	Kofar ta rufe.
She looked like a sweetheart.	Ta yi kamar mai dadi.
So hard to see.	Don haka da wuya a gani.
I know it's true.	Na san yana da gaskiya.
Now right.	Yanzu dama.
Say yes.	Ce ka a .
It's hard to do anything.	Yana da wuya a yi komai.
She should stop all this.	Lallai yakamata ta daina duk wannan.
It is not a mistake.	Ba kuskure ba ne.
We live at home.	Muna zaune a gida.
He looked.	Ya duba.
Maybe he already has a wife and a home.	Wataƙila ya riga ya sami mata da gida.
However, this does not work.	Duk da haka, wannan ba ya aiki.
This is how we want it.	Wannan shine yadda muke so.
I wonder what some people would think, a time like this.	Abin mamaki abin da wasu mutane za su yi tunani, lokaci irin wannan.
Sit down to a meal with them.	Zauna wurin cin abinci tare da su.
This is what he said.	Wannan shi ne abin da ya ce.
I do not have any of these.	Ba ni da ko ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan.
I am not ready for this.	Ban shirya don wannan ba.
But he began to think.	Amma shi ya fara tunani.
He touched his knee, gently.	Ya taba gwiwa, a hankali.
They should not be.	Kada su kasance.
Hope it helps.	Da fatan zai taimaka.
So do it right.	Don haka ku yi daidai.
We are waiting to see who will win.	Mun jira mu ga wanda zai yi nasara.
This should be easy, but my head is swimming.	Wannan yakamata ya zama mai sauƙi, amma kaina yana iyo.
There is no way to get around it.	Babu yadda za a yi a kusa da shi.
Suitable for indoor or outdoor use.	Ya dace da amfani na cikin gida ko waje.
Show, do not say.	Nuna, kar a fada.
Prepare it in time for dinner.	A shirya shi cikin lokaci don abincin dare.
Still she knew.	Duk da haka ta sani.
This is not for everyone.	Wannan ba kowa ba ne.
You told me the first day we met.	Kun ce min ranar farko da muka hadu.
How beautiful!	Yaya kyau!
Let's start small.	Mu fara kadan.
This goes twice if you travel a lot.	Wannan yana tafiya sau biyu idan kuna tafiya da yawa.
She knew what to say.	Ta san abin da zai ce.
Work should do only one thing.	Aiki yakamata yayi abu daya kawai.
How many do not have.	Nawa ba su da.
And up.	Kuma sama.
He did not enter the house.	Bai shiga gidan ba.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
Only I can talk to her about this.	Ni kadai za ta iya magana da ita a kan wannan.
Yet we should go early.	Amma duk da haka ya kamata mu tafi da wuri.
That's what we do.	Abin da muke yi ke nan.
To see.	Don gani.
Surely this would be a better place.	Tabbas wannan zai zama wuri mafi kyau.
Sleep and heat.	Barci da zafi.
Although maybe not.	Ko da yake watakila ba.
They do not like me.	Ba su so ni.
But for you too.	Amma ga ku kuma.
It is the only opportunity we have.	Ita ce kawai damar da muka samu.
Even before you.	Tun kafin ku.
I'm not sure if it is used.	Ban tabbata ko ana amfani da shi ba.
What you helped us do.	Abin da kuka taimake mu mu yi.
He immediately left.	Nan take ya fita.
He does not want to go.	Ba ya son tafiya.
This immediately confirms that.	Wannan nan da nan yana tabbatar da cewa .
She didn't seem to notice time moving.	Da alama bata ji lokaci tana tafiya ba.
No problem, of course.	Babu matsala, ba shakka.
He is in the process of making you.	Yana cikin yin ku.
That won't do anything.	Hakan ba zai yi komai ba.
They told him he was not wanted.	Suka ce masa ba a neman sa.
We use the right.	Muna amfani da daidai.
I didn’t start with the idea of ​​killing anyone.	Ban fara da tunanin kashe kowa ba.
Do not dwell on the fact that you know something about this.	Kada ka bari a kan cewa ka san wani abu game da wannan.
This is a great time.	Wannan babban lokaci ne.
Trying to fix things.	Ƙoƙarin gyara abubuwa.
He can call and ask them.	Zai iya kira ya tambaye su.
I want to say time goes on.	Ina so in ce lokaci ya ci gaba.
I myself have not used it much.	Ni kaina ban yi amfani da shi da yawa ba.
And he knows the game.	Kuma ya san wasan.
We are human.	Mu mutane ne.
I am not the only one who thinks so.	Ba ni kadai nake tunanin haka ba.
The problem is here.	Matsalar tana faruwa a nan.
This is a game.	Wannan wasa ne.
We do not have much time.	Ba mu da lokaci mai yawa.
He is an honest man.	Mutum ne mai gaskiya.
Without anyone willing to overcome them.	Ba tare da wanda ya yarda ya yi nasara da su ba.
And maybe they are.	Kuma watakila su ne.
It would be better if this never happened.	Gara a ce hakan bai taba faruwa ba.
I do not want to suffer any more.	Ba na son ƙarin wahala.
You are more human than you know.	Kai mutum ne fiye da yadda ka sani.
This is the second chance in life.	Wannan dama ce ta biyu a rayuwa.
She traveled for three years.	Ta yi tafiya shekara uku.
She has what she thinks is a work in progress.	Tana da abin da take tunanin aiki ne so.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
Maybe there is a way.	Wataƙila akwai hanya.
There is little to be done.	Akwai kaɗan da za a yi.
I do not remember much later.	Ban tuna da yawa daga baya ba.
No one can tell you the time, either.	Ba wanda zai iya gaya muku lokacin, ko.
Then it happened again.	Sai abin ya sake faruwa.
Buy in bulk or bulk size.	Sayi cikin girma ko girma girma.
I will keep fighting.	Zan ci gaba da fada.
Try it sometimes.	Gwada shi wani lokaci.
In fact there is a third.	A gaskiya akwai na uku.
But maybe it was.	Amma watakila ya kasance.
I was not very happy.	Ban yi farin ciki sosai ba.
Enough, in fact to see him twice today.	Ya isa, a gaskiya don ganin shi sau biyu a yau.
There is no time to lose.	Babu lokacin da za a rasa.
It costs a lot of money	Yana da kudi da yawa
There must be some error.	Dole ne a sami ɗan kuskure.
We will eat together.	Za mu ci abinci tare.
The problem is another.	Matsalar kuma wata ce.
Our plan is to arrive early.	Shirin mu shine mu isa da wuri.
It does not travel when needed.	Ba ya tafiya lokacin da ake bukata.
No man has ever done or can speak as well as he does.	Babu wani mutum da ya taɓa yin ko iya magana kamar yadda yake yi.
Yet she did the right thing.	Amma duk da haka ita ma ta yi hakan a hanya mai kyau.
They like not to work.	Suna son rashin yin aiki.
It's nothing.	Ba abu bane.
I asked for help	Na nemi taimako
I just want to make sure.	Ina so kawai in tabbatar.
She got in there too.	Dama ta shiga can ma.
Anyone who wants to.	Duk wanda yake so.
If he doesn’t, things start to get a little scary.	Idan bai yi haka ba, abubuwa sun fara ɗan ban tsoro.
I think this is the only way.	Ina tsammanin wannan ita ce kawai hanya.
I'm not sure what has changed.	Ban tabbata abin da ya canza ba.
I think they still are not.	Ina tsammanin har yanzu ba haka suke ba.
To do this, we need people.	Don yin wannan, muna buƙatar mutane.
Can't read anything closed.	Bata iya karanta komai a rufe ba.
And it feels like that.	Kuma yana jin kamar haka.
Or, no.	Ko kuma, a'a.
It will pass.	Zai wuce.
He has such patience.	Yana da irin wannan hakuri.
I know it's true.	Na san gaskiya ne.
I gave her money.	Na ba ta kudi.
I was surprised.	Na yi mamaki.
It would not be good to try and run now.	Ba zai yi kyau a gwada da gudu yanzu ba.
Playing is work.	Yin wasa aiki ne.
That would not be necessary, really.	Wannan ba zai zama dole ba, da gaske.
Not necessarily.	Ba lallai ba ne.
This is amazing.	Wannan abin ban mamaki ne.
I do not know how it happened.	Ban san yadda hakan ya faru ba.
It happened with a song.	Haka ya faru da waƙa.
Nothing, nothing.	Babu komai, babu komai.
And you know that it kills him inside.	Kuma kun san cewa yana kashe shi a ciki.
Now everyone agrees.	Yanzu kowa ya yarda.
You can't go on like this.	Ba za ku iya ci gaba kamar haka ba.
He told me to go slowly and go fast.	Ya ce in tafi a hankali in tafi da sauri.
We didn't talk.	Ba mu yi magana ba.
And that will not stop.	Kuma hakan ba zai tsaya ba.
It takes time before he stays in it.	Yana ɗaukar lokaci kafin ya zauna a ciki.
It is morning now.	Da safe ne yanzu.
Not just me.	Ba ni kawai ba.
I don't need you to change who you are not '.	Bana bukatar ka canza ka zama wanda ba kai ba'.
We play with each other.	Muna wasa da juna.
Or better yet.	Ko mafi kyau tukuna.
If you do, don’t go into too many expectations.	Idan kun yi, kada ku shiga tsammanin da yawa.
They used to eat well.	Sun saba cin abinci da kyau.
I use it myself and it only works for me.	Ina amfani da shi da kaina kuma yana aiki kawai a gare ni.
At best, it will be missed.	A mafi kyau, za a rasa shi.
He enjoys himself now to kill everyone.	Ya ji daɗin kansa a yanzu don ya kashe kowa.
However, do not worry about that.	Duk da haka, kada ku damu da haka.
It’s a bit like bringing it back for a while.	Yana da ɗan kamar dawo da shi na ɗan lokaci.
I was almost your best man once.	Na kasance kusan mafi kyawun mutumin ku sau ɗaya.
I have never been the one to stay.	Ban taba zama wanda zan zauna ba.
And yet again.	Kuma duk da haka kuma.
It just worked.	Kamar ya yi aiki.
So be it.	Haka ya kasance.
But the thought did not please him.	Amma tunanin bai masa dadi ba.
Do not pass.	Kada ku wuce.
I told her she didn't have to do anything.	Na ce mata ba sai ta yi komai ba.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
It seems to be above that.	Da alama yana sama da haka.
She hoped not to see him cry.	Ta yi fatan ba don ya ga ta yi kuka ba.
I have not tried anything.	Ban gwada komai ba.
I answered in the same way as above.	Na amsa daidai da na sama.
I would love to see more.	Ina sha'awar ganin ƙarin.
So sad, but still not lost.	Don haka bakin ciki, amma har yanzu ba a rasa ba.
There will be?	Za a yi?
All fat.	Duk mai.
And now it is.	Kuma yanzu yana da.
He came home, and we never talked about it.	Ya dawo gida, kuma ba mu taɓa yin magana game da shi ba.
Eventually, people began to enjoy the project.	Daga ƙarshe, mutane sun fara jin daɗin aikin.
You can do it now.	Kuna iya yin shi yanzu.
The first day was good.	Ranar farko ta yi kyau.
If you want to take it fast, we will do it quickly.	Idan kuna son ɗauka da sauri, za mu yi sauri.
When we need it.	Lokacin da muke bukata.
I am not an athlete.	Ni ba mai wasa bane.
He is an earthly being.	Shi dan duniya ne.
If they have any.	Idan suna da wani.
I want to stay here.	Ina son zama a nan.
I know you want to talk.	Na san kuna son yin magana.
There is no way in the world.	Babu wata hanya a duniya.
What did you say?	Me kuka ce?
We were together all this time.	Mun kasance tare duk tsawon wannan lokacin.
Maybe another month for women, you know.	Watakila kuma wata na mata, ka sani.
They will probably never act on what they really feel.	Wataƙila ba za su taɓa yin aiki da ainihin abin da suke ji ba.
There must be something.	Lallai akwai wani abu.
Serious mistake.	Mummunan kuskure.
But you have.	Amma kuna da.
The second day was not a good one.	Rana ta biyu ba ta da kyau.
You can help us with this project.	Kuna iya taimaka mana da wannan aikin.
Like everyone else, she just wanted to go home.	Kamar kowa, kawai ta so ta koma gida.
I always go back.	Na koma kullum.
I am very hot.	Ina cikin zafi sosai.
But, you have to be really good.	Amma, dole ne ku kasance da kyau sosai.
I have to keep going.	Dole ne in ci gaba.
Not at all true, of course.	Ba gaskiya ba ne gaba ɗaya, ba shakka.
Of course not.	Tabbas hakan bai kasance ba.
He always blames others.	Kullum yana zargin wasu.
Help! 	Taimako!
help! 	taimako!
I honestly don't care either.	Ni gaskiya ban damu ba ko.
someone help us!	wani ya taimake mu!
We do this every day.	Muna yin haka kowace rana.
He could not eat properly.	Ba ya iya cin abinci yadda ya kamata.
It will continue.	Za ta ci gaba.
I do not know what they will be.	Ban san abin da za su kasance ba.
I will tell you.	Zan gaya muku.
Everything is more clear to you than anyone else.	Komai ya fi bayyana a gare ku fiye da sauran.
Yet nothing happened.	Amma duk da haka babu wani abu da ya faru.
But he also failed to find the place.	Amma shi ma ya kasa samun wurin.
The way things are.	Hanyar abubuwa.
They are used although this is well known.	Ana amfani da su ko da yake an san hakan.
So you can.	Don haka kuna iya.
Let me tell you, this product works.	Bari in gaya muku, wannan kayan yana aiki.
She did not know what to do.	Bata san me zata yi ba.
She seems unable to drive.	Da alama ba za ta iya tuƙi ba.
He will have a chance.	Zai samu dama.
Not if we really agree with what we think we are.	Ba idan da gaske mun yarda da abin da muke tunanin mu ne.
This dish really worked for me.	Wannan abincin ya yi min aiki da gaske.
The players were thrilled with the story.	'Yan wasan sun yi farin ciki da labarin.
They are walking on the beach.	Suna tafiya bakin ruwa.
After two years, he returned home.	Bayan tsawon shekaru biyu, ya koma gida.
No one is coming.	Babu mai zuwa.
I will help her.	Zan taimake ta.
What you see is what you get.	Abin da kuke gani shine abin da kuka samu.
I want to get it on my own.	Ina son samun shi a kaina.
He was always nice with the kids.	Ya kasance mai kyau da yara koyaushe.
More than the previous one.	Ya fi na baya.
She thinks something is wrong.	Ta na ganin wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
She is seriously injured.	Ta ji rauni sosai.
Let's accept that in the future.	Mu yarda da hakan a gaba.
They can't.	Ba za su iya ba.
All is not well prepared for what might come next.	Duk ba a shirya sosai ga abin da zai iya zuwa ba.
He speaks to them all.	Yana magana da su duka.
And no one can tell you where.	Kuma ba wanda zai iya gaya muku inda.
I never felt it was over.	Ban taba jin an gama ba.
But this is not the only answer.	Amma ba wannan ba ita kaɗai ce amsa ba.
I thought he would sleep nothing to take care of her.	Ina tunanin zai yi barci ba komai ba don ta kula da shi.
We can change that.	Za mu iya canza hakan.
People died there.	Mutane sun mutu a can.
Life was like that.	Rayuwa ta kasance haka.
I don’t know what the problem is here.	Ban san menene matsalar ba a nan.
It is impossible to live without it.	Ba za a iya rayuwa ba tare da shi ba.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
I don't want to miss you before the trip.	Ba zan so in rasa ku ba kafin tafiya.
They love you if you love them.	Suna son ku idan kuna son su.
This is his success.	Wannan shi ne ya yi nasara.
They have never been so beautiful.	Ba su taɓa zama da kyau sosai ba.
You do.	Kun yi .
It is raining every day.	Ana yin ruwan sama a kowace rana.
This look is not good.	Wannan kallon ba shi da kyau.
He spoke very seriously.	Ya fad'a da gaske.
I remember killing him.	Na tuna kashe shi.
Everyone was surprised.	Kowa ya yi mamaki.
I want to give them everything they need to remember me.	Ina so in ba su kowane abin da za su tuna da ni.
They brought me back to earth.	Sun dawo da ni duniya.
Think of everything you got.	Ka yi tunanin duk abin da ka samu.
I have been able to watch this man many times.	Na sami damar kallon wannan mutumin sau da yawa.
And this, the reader, must change.	Kuma wannan, mai karatu, dole ne ya canza.
When did this happen?	Yaushe wannan ya faru?
If it makes you feel good, it’s bad.	Idan ya sa ka ji dadi, yana da mummunan.
It's bigger than the previous one.	Ya fi na baya girma.
Something suggests, of course.	Wani abu ya nuna, tabbas.
The story is scary.	Labarin yana da ban tsoro.
Someone exactly right.	Wani daidai daidai.
More than anything she wanted to go.	Fiye da komai ta so ya tafi.
They don't seem to care.	Da alama ba su damu ba.
Many are coming for years.	Mutane da yawa suna zuwa shekaru.
There is no such thing.	Babu wani abu kamar wannan.
And, you heard something.	Kuma, kun ji wani abu.
Please, please help.	Don Allah, don Allah a taimaka.
This will work.	Wannan zai yi aiki.
Increased volume up to the top.	An ƙara ƙara har zuwa sama.
Thoughts are wrong.	Tunanin ba daidai ba ne.
So there is always this.	Don haka ko da yaushe akwai wannan.
I'll catch you.	Zan kama ku.
He got up quickly.	Ya tashi da sauri.
She flew up into the sky.	Ta tashi ta tashi sama.
So we just decided enough was enough.	Don haka kawai muka yanke shawarar isa ya isa.
No, not necessarily, no.	A'a, ba lallai ba ne, a'a.
Now she uses a stick.	Yanzu tana amfani da sanda.
He did not know what.	Bai san me ba.
Weep slowly	Kuka take a hankali
I have a lot to hear right now.	Ina da yawa da zan ji a yanzu.
Maybe she just looked a little scared.	Watakila ta yi kamar ta ɗan ji tsoro.
I still can't believe it is happening.	Har yanzu na kasa yarda cewa hakan na faruwa.
For son.	Don dan.
No one else.	Babu wani kuma.
They will come back to me for that.	Za su dawo gare ni akan hakan.
It hurts.	Ya yi zafi.
But she could not help it.	Amma ta kasa taimaka.
I wrote the truth about myself.	Na rubuta gaskiya game da kaina.
They do everything for him.	Komai suke masa.
So the problem came to this.	Don haka matsalar ta zo ga wannan.
Now she stands alone.	Yanzu ita kadai ta tsaya.
There was never a killer.	Ba a taba samun wanda ya kashe shi ba.
Anything they can put on a stick.	Duk abin da za su iya sanya sanda.
Everyone heard.	Kowa ya ji.
I think they are very useful !.	Ina ganin suna da amfani sosai!.
We decided not to go.	Mun yanke shawarar ba za mu je ba.
I'm just here.	Ni ne kawai a nan.
It goes beyond that.	Ya wuce haka.
She was beautiful.	Ta kasance mai kyau.
He is coming home.	Yana zuwa gida.
She told him she would go.	Ta fada masa zata tafi.
I would not like to recommend anything.	Ba zan so in ba da shawarar wani abu ba.
One might even say that it is recommended.	Mutum na iya ma cewa an ba da shawarar.
I'm sure everyone knows.	Na tabbata kowa ya sani.
I will bring you, he said.	Zan zo da ku, ya ce.
All in all very pleased.	Duk a cikin duka sosai yarda.
Can't wait for tonight.	Ba za a iya jira yau da dare.
More than a surprise.	Fiye da mamaki.
I think it's delicious.	Ina tsammanin yana da dadi.
And he sat down to do it for everyone.	Kuma ya zauna a gaba ya yi wa kowa da kowa.
It doesn't have to be fun.	Ba lallai ne ya zama abin farin ciki ba.
He was beheaded for lying.	Sai aka yanke kansa saboda karya.
At one point they went to the boat.	A wani lokaci sun tafi jirgin ruwa.
And we ate tonight.	Kuma muna ci a daren yau.
But it is a good thing.	Amma abu ne mai kyau.
They will be somewhere in total.	Za su kasance wani wuri gaba ɗaya.
He wanted to give her everything.	Ya so ya mata komai.
By then it was too late.	Zuwa lokacin ya riga ya makara.
But more than that, they are role models.	Amma fiye da haka, su ne abin koyi.
Many people want to run.	Mutane da yawa suna son gudu.
She doesn't have to.	Ba ta da ko.
But not others.	Amma ba wasu ba.
I'll show you where everything is set.	Zan nuna maka inda aka sa komai.
Look another way.	Ka kalli wata hanyar.
He is not accustomed to being touched.	Bai saba ana taba shi ba.
But it is not certain.	Amma bai da tabbas.
I am accustomed to it.	Na saba masa.
But it is in a good place.	Amma yana cikin wuri mai kyau.
I have a good trip.	Ina da wani abu mai kyau tafiya.
It will not work.	Ba za a yi aiki ba.
It is time to go out to eat.	Lokaci ya yi da za a fita cin abinci.
The feeling was mine.	Jin daɗin ya kasance nawa.
I really, though.	Ina da gaske, ko da yake.
They will not be caught alive, and they know it.	Ba za a kama su da rai ba, kuma sun sani.
I am not the kind of person I would go on living.	Ni ba irin mutumin da zan ci gaba da rayuwa ba ne.
We can see how that goes.	Za mu iya ganin yadda hakan ke tafiya.
We started fighting.	Muka fara fada.
I want to start reading on.	Ina so in fara karatu a kan.
Another game came to life.	Wani wasa ya zo a rai.
If you do you will know.	Idan kun yi za ku sani.
It’s about the person for me.	Yana da game da mutum a gare ni.
Lots of women, little time.	Mata da yawa, lokaci kaɗan.
I look like a kid.	Na yi kama da yaro.
Not necessarily in one place.	Ba lallai ba ne a wuri guda.
I talked to her constantly.	Na yi mata magana kullum.
I enjoyed it.	Na ji dadi da shi.
We bought.	Mun saya.
We must enjoy it.	Dole ne mu ji daɗi da shi.
You will have access to me.	Za ku sami damar zuwa gare ni.
That was the first thing we tried.	Abu na farko da muka gwada kenan.
Maybe I should have thought better of it myself.	Wataƙila na yi mafi kyau in yi tunanin hakan a kaina.
Longevity also helps.	Tsawon lokaci ya taimaka ma.
It's nothing.	Ba komai ba ne.
She kept it together somehow.	Ta ajiye tare ko ta yaya.
It also works.	Hakan ma yana aiki.
They do not.	Ba sa yi.
The water should stop.	Ruwa ya kamata ya tsaya.
I can see right there.	Ina iya gani daidai a wurin.
I often wonder what others think of us.	Sau da yawa ina mamakin abin da wasu suke tunani game da mu.
This year, it must be.	A wannan shekara, dole ne ya kasance.
I can send it to him.	Zan iya aika masa.
He was amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
Or you can tell us what you know.	Ko kuma za ku iya gaya mana abin da kuka sani.
It does not exist.	Babu shi.
We can go with any story he wants.	Muna iya tafiya da duk labarin da yake so.
That will not win the game.	Wannan ba zai yi nasara a wasan ba.
There are a lot of things in the game here.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa a cikin wasa a nan.
He knew something.	Ya san wani abu.
So this is easy.	Don haka mai sauƙi ne wannan.
He will tell me anyway.	Zai gaya mani ko yaya.
He feels she is coming.	Yana jin tana zuwa.
You will be here with us.	Za ku kasance a nan tare da mu.
They found something nearby, she thought.	Sun sami wani abu a kusa, ta yi tunani.
One go.	Daya tafi.
How he loves them.	Yadda yake son su.
So stay close to me.	Don haka ku tsaya kusa da ni.
It's wrong.	Ba daidai ba ne.
He could not hear anything.	Ya kasa jin ko menene.
We called it twice.	Mun kira shi sau biyu.
Maybe they forgot about me.	Wataƙila sun manta da ni.
He is a big boy.	Shi babban yaro ne.
He could not think of anything to say.	Ya kasa tunanin komai zai ce.
I will not be there.	Ba zan kasance a wurin ba.
If it tastes good, try it.	Idan yana da daɗi, gwada shi.
Just for today, though.	Kawai don yau, ko da yake.
The thought annoyed her.	Tunani ya bata mata rai.
This is an interesting thing so far.	Wannan abu ne mai ban sha'awa ya zuwa yanzu.
And maybe they will.	Kuma watakila za su yi.
Stay with him.	Ku zauna da shi.
It really does nothing, however.	Da gaske ba ya yin komai, duk da haka.
Be here all the time.	Kasance a nan duk tsawon wannan lokacin.
We will make sure that this does not happen again.	Za mu tabbatar da cewa hakan bai sake faruwa ba.
You can get it at the end.	Kuna iya samun ta a karshen.
Maybe you like her back.	Wataƙila kuna son ta baya.
After a while he said that again.	Bayan wani lokaci ya sake cewa.
And she still does.	Kuma har yanzu ta yi hakan.
And a week later.	Kuma mako bayan haka.
I'll try one.	Zan gwada daya.
Almost no one knows you.	Kusan babu wanda ya san ku.
Everyone is fine.	Kowa yana lafiya.
This is a problem.	Wannan matsala ce.
It will be like this.	Zai zama kamar haka.
The truth is.	Gaskiya ta yi.
It's sad to see.	Yana da bakin ciki ganin.
Now, give us the money.	Yanzu, ku ba mu kuɗin.
In fact, it is certainly true.	A gaskiya, tabbas yana da gaskiya.
We will stop here again.	Za mu tsaya a nan kuma.
It feels right at the time.	Yana jin daidai a lokacin.
The sun is eating.	Rana tana ci.
What about health.	Me game da lafiya.
I think this is a mistake.	Ina ganin wannan kuskure ne.
It's like everything.	Kamar komai ne.
And again.	Da kuma.
There is even something true in it.	Akwai ma wani abu na gaskiya a ciki.
She thought it was good.	Ta dauka yana da kyau.
Sometimes these things happen.	Wani lokaci waɗannan abubuwan suna faruwa.
She closed the door slowly.	Ta rufe kofar a hankali.
What a waste of time.	Wane irin bata lokaci ne.
Concerns arose.	Hankali ya tashi.
It happened.	Ya faru.
That didn't work.	Wannan bai yi aiki ba.
But no one asked us.	Amma babu wanda ya tambaye mu.
Now on to the program.	Yanzu akan shirin.
It just feels good.	Yana jin dadi kawai.
You are the best.	Ke ce mafi kyau duka.
No one gave him grief.	Babu wanda ya ba shi bakin ciki.
We also used.	Mun kuma yi amfani.
So far, everything is working out as expected.	Ya zuwa yanzu, komai yana aiki kamar yadda aka zata.
You will find two in this book.	Za ku sami biyu a cikin wannan littafin.
This worked well, but it was a lot of work.	Wannan ya yi aiki da kyau, amma aiki ne mai yawa.
Take the time to get to know him.	Ɗauki lokaci don ku san shi.
I will not say.	Ba zan ce ba.
But it is enough.	Amma ya isa.
They were great.	Sun kasance masu girma.
It's definitely scary.	Lallai yana da ban tsoro.
You will again.	Za ku sake.
Otherwise, nothing will change.	In ba haka ba, babu abin da zai canza.
So it is not very useful.	Don haka ba shi da amfani sosai.
We need them in this game.	Muna bukatar su a cikin wannan wasan.
This is an amazing achievement.	Wannan nasara ce mai ban mamaki.
If not, it can still be repaired.	Idan ba haka ba, har yanzu ana iya gyara shi.
I want to hate you.	Ina so in ƙi ku.
In the end, it 's too late, too late.	A ƙarshe, ya yi kadan, ya makara.
Everyone loves it.	Kowa ya so shi.
Funny is recommended.	Ana ba da shawarar abin ban dariya.
Of course, it is wrong.	Tabbas, ba daidai ba ne.
We can fix it.	Za mu iya gyara shi.
There is something you should know.	Akwai wani abu da ya kamata ku sani.
With children.	Da yara.
He told me everything.	Ya gaya mani komai.
As you know, that time has passed many years.	Kamar yadda ka sani, wannan lokacin ya wuce shekaru da yawa.
And happiness too.	Kuma farin ciki ma.
Maybe a little too much.	Wataƙila ya ɗan yi yawa.
I wonder if he ever came here.	Ina mamakin ko ya taba zuwa nan.
There is nothing they can do here.	Babu wani abu da za su yi a nan.
The day was hot, but so was she.	Ranar ta yi zafi, amma ita ma.
I thought it was something like that.	Na dauka wani abu ne kamar haka.
Some good stuff.	Wasu abubuwa masu kyau.
He left.	Ya tafi.
It's a really nice place.	Wuri ne mai kyau gaske.
I understand completely.	Na gane gaba daya.
I lost my place	Na rasa wuri
I really did not know what to do with myself.	Da gaske ban san me zan yi da kaina ba.
I will come back to this later.	Zan dawo kan wannan daga baya.
The same thing applies here.	Haka abin yake a nan.
Over the weekend.	A karshen mako guda.
There is more to it than that.	Akwai fiye da haka.
Where real things happen.	Wurin da abubuwa na gaske ke faruwa.
I want her to tell him that or more.	Ina son ta gaya masa haka ko kusa.
And we will make the world hear.	Kuma za mu sa duniya ta ji.
No one knows exactly what to do.	Babu wanda ya san ainihin abin da zai yi.
Now, you may think we are done.	Yanzu, kuna iya tunanin cewa mun gama.
Join them if you like.	Shiga su idan kuna so.
She really is gone.	Da gaske ta tafi.
Such a statement is very appropriate.	Irin wannan magana ta dace sosai.
She always wanted to give her everything.	Koyaushe tana son ba ta komai.
I think we have made good progress.	Ina ganin mun sami ci gaba mai kyau.
He just wants to play with it.	Wasa kawai yake son yi da ita.
I saved it.	Na ajiye shi.
And maybe she did.	Kuma watakila ta yi.
Wearing the dress she wants.	Sanye da rigar da take so.
I will	zan yi
Maybe he did.	Wataƙila ya yi.
No fighting.	Ba a yi fada ba.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
It is not from you.	Bai daga kai ba.
One year passed.	Shekara guda ta wuce.
People are always hurt.	Mutane suna jin rauni koyaushe.
Man, it was so hot it made me cry.	Mutum, ta yi zafi sosai ya sa na yi kuka.
Where did you go?	Ina ka tafi?
You are right in asking these things.	Kun yi daidai da kuka nemi waɗannan abubuwan.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba wannan ba.
No more opportunities.	Babu wata dama kuma.
We think we are so good.	Muna tsammanin muna da kyau haka.
So we can not say it is nothing.	Don haka ba za mu iya cewa ba komai ba ne.
I hope he continues to do so.	Ina fatan ya ci gaba da yin haka.
I continued as usual.	Na ci gaba kamar yadda na saba.
Do not be afraid to make mistakes.	Kada ku ji tsoron yin kuskure.
Start with what they know.	Fara da abin da suka sani.
It seems like a big deal to me.	Ga alama babban abu ne a gare ni.
I have never seen such a sight.	Bata taba ganin irin wannan gani ba.
They got it right.	Sun samu daidai.
Now, he will run.	A yanzu, zai gudu.
Whoever it is.	Wanda ya kasance.
I quit.	Na daina.
I think it's funny.	Ina tsammanin abin dariya ne.
And you must be so.	Kuma dole ne ku zama haka.
People are interested in joining the event.	Mutane suna da sha'awar shiga taron.
We thought so, however.	Mun yi tunanin haka, duk da haka.
Here it is.	Ga shi kuma.
It's just hard.	Yana da wuya kawai.
They hit, all right.	Sun buga, duk daidai.
Maybe when he leaves they will forget him.	Watakila idan ya tafi sai su manta da shi.
You certainly know.	Lallai kun sani.
Go, or you will lose your flight.	Tafi, ko za ku rasa jirgin ku.
I am with you.	Na wurin ku.
The three of us together.	Mu uku tare.
I do not see much.	Ban gani da yawa ba.
All of these things seem to have come together.	Duk waɗannan abubuwa kamar sun zo gaba ɗaya.
Someone nearby was crying.	Wani na kusa yana kuka.
They hit twice.	Sun buga sau biyu.
Second hand.	Hannu na biyu.
This water is awesome.	Wannan ruwan yana da ban tsoro.
Removed from the road.	An cire daga hanya.
I know something is wrong.	Na san wani abu bai dace ba.
We were amazed at what they were doing.	Mun yi mamakin abin da suke yi.
I am not early.	Ba ni da wuri.
I was afraid to do anything.	Na ji tsoron yin komai.
They just look at them.	Kallon su kawai suke yi.
He did not stop or look at anything.	Bai tsaya ko kallon komai ba.
We report what we have seen.	Muna ba da labarin abin da muka gani.
I have not laughed at this for a long time.	Na dade ban yi wannan dariya ba.
I want to stay at home.	Ina son zama a gida.
Are you going to swim?	Za ku je yin iyo?
But the real problem is very complex.	Amma ainihin matsalar tana da matukar wahala.
You two are made just for each other.	An yi ku biyu don juna kawai.
She opened the door again.	Ta sake bude kofar.
It's time to dump her.	Lokaci ya yi a ƙarshe.
You must do this every day.	Dole ne ku yi haka kowace rana.
You will never leave her alone.	Ba za ku taɓa barin ta ita kaɗai ba.
Probably not.	Wataƙila ba haka ba ne.
I do it just to please him.	Ina yi ne kawai don son sa.
I'm sorry, but this is the case.	Yi hakuri, amma haka abin yake.
But it does not change anything.	Amma ba ya canza komai.
There is a time when that is enough.	Akwai lokacin da ya isa hakan daga baya.
They live together.	Suna zama tare.
Here is what happened.	A nan ne abin ya faru.
To be just.	Don zama kawai.
It did not go out like that.	Ba a fita haka ba.
it is a waste of time.	bata lokaci ne.
She couldn't play outside anyway.	Ta kasa yin wasa a waje ko yaya.
They are not comfortable.	Ba su da daɗi.
I love them.	Ina son su.
And that is what they did.	Kuma abin da suka yi ke nan.
So, pay close attention to what you are doing.	Saboda haka, kula sosai ga abin da kuke yi.
It was best heard during the second season.	An fi jin shi a lokacin lokaci na biyu.
I’m working on the same thing right now.	Ina aiki akan abu guda a yanzu.
There is no reason to delay.	Babu dalilin bata lokaci.
Not the kind of room you usually see today.	Ba irin dakin da kuke yawan gani a yau ba.
I want us to come up with something new.	Ina so mu fito da wani sabon abu.
Not now.	Ba yanzu ba.
No police in sight.	Babu 'yan sanda a gani.
We will do the same.	Haka za mu yi.
You probably won't be surprised at this point.	Wataƙila hakan ba zai ba ku mamaki ba a wannan lokacin.
Don't worry yet.	Kada mu damu tukuna.
You have to be good to me, by no means.	Dole ne ku zama masu kyau a gare ni, ba ta wata hanya ba.
It is difficult to know.	Yana da wuya a sani.
But you just do not know, until you know.	Amma kawai ba ku sani ba, sai kun sani.
Think kids!	Ka yi tunanin yara!
She kept telling everyone that she was fine, but no one believed her.	Ta yi ta gaya wa kowa cewa tana lafiya, amma babu wanda ya yarda da ita.
It is good to read.	Yana da kyau a karanta.
It would be nice.	Zai yi kyau.
It doesn't fit.	Bai dace da shi ba.
I hate losing it.	Na ƙi rasa shi.
And of course they are.	Kuma ba shakka su ne.
And they failed us.	Kuma sun kasa mu.
A lot of things are happening here.	Abubuwa da yawa suna faruwa a nan.
Nor does she need to know.	Haka kuma ba ta bukatar sani.
I was changed from that moment forward.	An canza ni daga wannan lokacin gaba.
But, again, maybe not.	Amma, kuma, watakila a'a.
I have to be scared.	Dole ne in ji tsoro.
There is so much to do!	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a yi!
That's right.	Haka yake.
Imagine how you would feel in the morning.	Ka yi tunanin yadda za ka ji da safe.
It's cold.	Yayi sanyi.
No, not you.	A'a, ba kai ba.
But he continued.	Amma ya ci gaba.
It rarely happens.	Yana da wuya ya faru.
Nothing was taken.	Ba a dauki komai ba.
I started to feel pain.	Na fara jin zafi.
Otherwise, who knows.	In ba haka ba, wa ya sani.
He took your place.	Ya dauki wurin ku.
Bring up.	Ta yarda.
Remember who started it.	Ka tuna wanda ya fara shi.
Surprisingly, both.	Abin mamaki ne, duka.
Now things are going well.	Yanzu abin ya yi kyau.
We waited patiently for our car.	Muka jira motar mu da hakuri.
It became very immediate.	Ya zama nan da nan da gaske.
So I'll check.	Don haka zan duba.
Let them understand, he thought.	Bari su gane, ya yi tunani.
We enjoyed such.	Mun ji daɗi irin wannan.
God bless you!	Allah ka yi tsawon rai!
He asked them if there was anything they did not like.	Ya tambaye su ko akwai abin da ba su so.
He said the police rushed in.	Ya ce ‘yan sanda sun shiga da sauri.
I think these are the best things.	Ina tsammanin waɗannan su ne mafi kyawun abubuwa.
I understand you.	Na gane ku.
Today we know that lies are on the way.	A yau mun san cewa karya ce ke kan hanya.
This is the way.	Wannan ita ce hanya.
He did not use to be that way.	Bai yi amfani da zama haka ba.
They are the best place to look for oil.	Su ne wuri mafi kyau don neman mai.
It seems like a success for me.	Yana kama da nasara a gare ni.
The owners are there.	Masu gidan suna can.
She should not be left alone.	Kada ta zauna ita kaɗai.
He would tell her things, no doubt.	Zai gaya mata abubuwa, babu shakka.
He did it for himself.	Ya yi wa kansa.
John is going to leave.	John zai tafi.
Such a waste of time.	Irin wannan bata lokaci.
They are worried about the future.	Sun damu da abin da zai zo nan gaba.
I want to do the right thing.	Ina so in yi abin da yake daidai.
But this book seems like a good thing to me.	Amma wannan littafin ya zama kamar abu mai kyau a gare ni.
The meal was prepared.	An shirya abincin.
Check it out below.	Kalli shi a kasa.
One fix and then another.	Gyara daya sai wani ya tafi.
And so it is with money.	Kuma haka abin yake da kudi.
I also met him.	Ni ma na hadu da shi.
I'm still waiting for an answer.	Har yanzu ina jiran amsa.
Let me try to fill one.	Bari in yi ƙoƙari na cika ɗaya.
You're right, though.	Kuna da gaskiya, ko da yake.
Sad to see him now joining this project.	Bakin ciki ganin shi yanzu yana shiga wannan aikin.
There is nothing sad about them.	Babu wani abin bakin ciki game da su.
Let me start with that.	Bari in fara da cewa.
It is her life.	Ita ce ta rayuwa.
Oh my God .	Ya Allah na .
This is not the job of the children, she said.	Wannan ba aikin yara bane, ta ce ba kowa.
There are no other girls in the house.	Babu sauran 'yan mata a gidan.
I heard he was gone.	Na ji ya tafi.
He caught you.	Ya kama ku.
Nothing lasts longer.	Babu wani abu da ya wuce wani lokaci.
People will no longer carry it.	Mutane ba za su ƙara ɗauka ba.
No stomach, no stomach.	Ciki babu, babu shi a ciki.
They wanted to stop.	Sun so su tsaya.
They feel they do not need anyone but each other.	Sun ji ba sa bukatar kowa sai juna.
All is well.	Komai lafiya.
It happens every week.	Yana faruwa kowane mako.
So we went for a drink.	Sai muka tafi sha.
I am used to it.	Na saba da shi.
But we did not.	Amma ba mu yi ba.
But these are not.	Amma waɗannan ba.
I can't make him focus.	Ba zan iya sa shi ya mai da hankali ba.
They can be scary.	Suna iya zama mai ban tsoro.
Many do not.	Da yawa ba sa.
At first, the problem was you just loved the game.	Tun da farko, matsalar ita ce kawai kuna son wasan.
Don’t think too much about it.	Kar ka yi tunani da yawa game da shi.
He will not miss.	Ba zai rasa ba.
Stay close to me.	Ku kasance kusa da ni.
We call on them to do more.	Muna kira gare su da su kara yin hakan.
The man helped him get up.	Mutumin ya taimaka masa ya tashi.
There is something here for everyone.	Akwai wani abu a nan ga kowa da kowa.
However, there is something strange happening.	Duk da haka, akwai wani abu mai ban mamaki da ke faruwa.
That was the decision she made.	Wannan ita ce shawarar da ta yi nasara.
I looked at the dog.	Na kalli kare.
Or buy mana.	Ko saya mana.
It can work.	Yana iya aiki.
We travel from work to home.	Muna tafiya daga aiki zuwa gida.
Or they were, for someone, somewhere.	Ko kuma sun kasance, ga wani, wani wuri.
I enjoy their work.	Ina jin daɗin aikin su.
He got no answer.	Bai samu amsa ba.
You are afraid of losing it.	Kuna tsoron rasa shi.
Whatever it is, it is not food.	Duk abin da yake, ba abinci ba ne.
At home.	A gida.
He didn't even want to be around them.	Bai ma son zama kusa da su ba.
I'll tell you what we do here.	Zan gaya muku abin da muke yi a nan.
This has been happening for some time now.	Hakan yana faruwa na ɗan lokaci kaɗan yanzu.
But they didn't do anything about it.	Amma ba su yi komai da shi ba.
Inside and out before they know what’s going on.	A ciki da waje kafin su san me ke faruwa.
Done now.	An yi yanzu.
Everyone understands the reason.	Kowa ya gane dalilin.
That's what everyone is saying.	Abin da kowa ke faɗa ke nan.
I am in pain	Ina jin zafi
I know what to do.	Na san abin da zai yi.
I'm back here.	Na koma nan.
Doing the right thing.	Yin abin da ya dace.
But then he makes the next mistake.	Amma sai ya ba da kuskure mai zuwa.
You have to stay.	Dole ne ku zauna.
Things happen, life happens.	Abubuwa suna faruwa, rayuwa tana faruwa.
He does not like anyone.	Ba ya son kowa.
The water is hot!	Ruwan yayi zafi!
Insufficient.	Rashin isa.
Not a dog, though.	Ba kare ba, ko .
Fast and passionate.	Mai sauri da sha'awa.
She asked him to go anyway.	Ta tambaye shi ya tafi duk da haka.
Forget it for now.	Manta shi don yanzu.
And that will be.	Kuma hakan zai kasance.
And we can talk.	Kuma muna iya magana.
I like that.	Ina son hakan.
Don't make me do it.	Kar ka sa ni yi.
I think she is dead.	Ina tsammanin ta mutu.
I did too.	Ni ma na yi.
Wrong in place.	Ba daidai ba cikin wurin.
I never knew how to reach him.	Ban taba sanin yadda zan kai shi ba.
If it is common.	Idan ya kasance na kowa.
Do what you want, and do it often.	Yi abin da kuke so, kuma ku yi sau da yawa.
One or two.	Daya ko biyu.
He will not go.	Ba zai tafi ba.
No problem with rain.	Babu matsala da ruwan sama.
The place is interesting.	Wurin yana da ban sha'awa.
Do not tell anyone you are going.	Kada ka gaya wa kowa za ka tafi.
Not allowed.	Bata yarda ba.
I don't remember doing that.	Ban tuna yin hakan ba.
It's not too much.	Bata ce da yawa ba.
Please can someone help me with this.	Don Allah wani zai iya taimaka mini da wannan.
Using your day to help others makes you a happier person.	Yin amfani da ranar ku don taimaka wa wasu yana sa ku zama mutum mai farin ciki.
Something known about the man.	Wani abu da aka sani game da mutumin.
But we did not.	Amma ba mu yi ba.
I want to show.	Ina so ya nuna.
It was definitely the most interesting.	Tabbas ya kasance mafi ban sha'awa.
I have nothing against you.	Ba ni da komai a gare ku.
We will do it every day.	Za mu yi shi kowace rana.
He also did not give it to me.	Shi ma bai ba ni ba.
Do not eat this!	Kada ku ci wannan!
It is a beautiful place.	Wuri ne mai kyau.
But we will make mistakes.	Amma za mu yi kuskure.
Who is speaking?	Wanene yake magana?
She remembers everything now.	Ta tuna komai yanzu.
There will be no problem.	Ba za a sami matsala ba.
She always lives there.	Kullum tana zaune a can.
Everything did not happen.	Duk abin bai faru ba.
So you need to be serious about that.	Don haka kuna buƙatar zama da gaske game da hakan.
"Hard money," she said.	Kud'i mai wuya' ta fad'a.
This could be a mistake gradually.	Wannan zai iya zama kuskure a hankali.
By no means, not at all.	Ba ta kowace hanya ba, ba a kowane lokaci ba.
This can be seen as follows.	Ana iya ganin wannan kamar haka.
I was so happy to give it to her.	Na yi matukar farin ciki da na ba ta.
This weekend will be tough.	Wannan karshen mako zai yi wuya.
That's what we call it.	Abin da muke kira shi ke nan.
So, the problem is still there.	Saboda haka, matsalar har yanzu tana nan.
She didn't, either.	Ita ma ba ta yi ba, da gaske.
Everyone wins.	Kowa yayi nasara.
He knocked on the door again.	Ya kara buga kofar.
Just stay ahead.	Kawai tsaya a gaba.
I want the next uncertainty.	Ina son rashin tabbas na gaba.
And it is sad.	Kuma abin bakin ciki ne.
He can't take care of anything after that.	Ba zai iya kula da komai ba bayan haka.
Yet women have risen in every way, many.	Amma duk da haka mata sun tashi ta kowace hanya, da yawa.
He did this three times.	Ya yi haka sau uku.
I love you, boy.	Ina son ku, yaro.
Productivity.	Yawan aiki.
You got all the rest.	Kun samu duk sauran.
She’s not human, and like me, she can’t feel pain.	Ita ba mutum ba ce, kuma kamar ni, ba za ta iya jin zafi ba.
I saw that my progress was slow.	Na ga ci gaba na ya kasance a hankali.
I had to meet her.	Dole na hadu da ita.
The rain fell.	Ruwan sama ya yi kasa.
She is not weak.	Ba ta da rauni.
How is your day today?	Yaya ranar ku yau?
There will be time for that.	Za a sami lokacin hakan.
You can join and win the trip.	Kuna iya shiga ku ci nasara tafiya.
Do not try to decide anything.	Kada ku yi ƙoƙarin yanke shawarar wani abu.
Nothing from outside can enter.	Babu wani abu daga waje da zai iya shiga.
We don't just work.	Ba ma aiki haka kawai.
You are happy.	Kun ji daɗi.
I immediately started crying.	Nan da nan na fara kuka.
Like a lot.	Kamar da yawa.
There I am, and there you are.	Akwai ni, kuma akwai ku.
How nice.	Yadda yayi kyau.
And call the police.	Kuma a kira 'yan sanda.
Now it works.	Yanzu yana aiki.
Man has a little intelligence, and he should use it.	Mutum yana da hankali kadan, kuma ya kamata ya yi amfani da shi.
One should think backwards.	Kamata yayi yayi tunani a baya.
And that's what people care about.	Kuma abin da mutane ke kula da shi ke nan.
Someone made this happen.	Wani ne ya sa hakan ta faru.
Attention the first person.	Hankali da mutum na farko.
Second, you must love it.	Na biyu, dole ne ku so shi.
How to 'come about'.	Yadda za a 'zo game'.
Where have you been? 	Ina ka je?
We will see about that.	Za mu gani game da wannan.
Everything he did was right.	Duk abin da ya yi daidai ne.
He is sure he is dead.	Ya tabbata ya mutu.
But we have to start somewhere.	Amma dole mu fara wani wuri.
They are difficult to concentrate.	Suna da wuya a mai da hankali.
Maybe he can't see anything.	Wataƙila ba ya iya ganin komai.
The game is still going on.	Har yanzu wasan ya ci gaba.
That did not happen.	Ba haka abin ya faru ba.
Start with driving.	Fara da tuƙi.
I know that.	Na san haka.
Life as he knows it will end.	Rayuwa kamar yadda ya sani za ta kare.
But there are also fears.	Amma kuma an ji tsoro.
Until then, all the time.	Har sai lokacin, duk lokacin.
I have no one to help me.	Ba ni da wani wanda zai taimake ni.
Likewise.	Haka kuma.
Are you coming from here?	Kuna zuwa daga nan?
That we should go.	Cewa sai mun tafi.
Honestly no one really cared.	Gaskiya babu wanda ya damu da gaske.
We felt really good.	Mun ji dadi sosai.
They can decide to do something funny to make people laugh.	Za su iya yanke shawarar zuwa wani abu mai ban dariya don su sa mutane dariya.
I never fought.	Ban taba yin fada ba.
We don’t even need to win.	Ba ma buƙatar yin nasara ba.
In one.	A daya.
I thought of getting up and working on something.	Na yi tunanin tashi da aiki a kan wani abu.
This does not work well, but it is a good place.	Wannan baya aiki daidai, amma wuri ne mai kyau.
This is a good country as you said.	Wannan kasa ce mai kyau kamar yadda kuka fada.
And if it works, it works.	Kuma idan yana aiki, yana aiki.
To prove a mistake.	Don tabbatar da kuskure.
I think it's good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau.
They're already worried about her, you know.	Dama sun damu da ita, ka sani.
I never thought of anything.	Ban taba tunanin komai ba.
I think that is happening again.	Ina ganin hakan yana kara faruwa.
Just have fun !.	Yi farin ciki kawai!.
Enough to see.	Ya isa ya gani.
We can't just live together.	Ba za mu iya zama tare kawai ba.
I do not know how that will happen.	Ban san yadda hakan zai faru ba.
I do not know.	Ban sani ba.
Hope to see everyone on the road !.	Fatan ganin kowa a hanya!.
Like any child.	Kamar kowane yaro.
It has to be more than that.	Dole ne ya zama fiye da haka.
You kid.	Kai yaro.
But even if it is true.	Amma ko da gaskiya ne.
I'm sure it will show.	Na tabbata zai nuna.
And very little.	Kuma kadan ne.
Something has changed.	Wani abu ya canza.
You must know where he is.	Dole ne ku san inda yake.
I don't want to get in the way.	Ba na son shiga hanya.
Ask her out well.	Sai ka tambaye ta hakan.
She didn't answer, she gave a hint.	Ba ta amsa ba, ta ba da alama.
Some may be.	Wasu na iya zama.
Pleasure is with the good.	Jin daɗi yana tare da masu kyau.
How much is not always good.	Nawa ba koyaushe yake da kyau ba.
But maybe he won.	Amma watakila ya ci nasara.
Almost a month.	Kusan lokacin wata.
Check that they fit.	Duba cewa sun dace.
It's an amazing thing.	Abu ne mai ban mamaki.
But we buy in it.	Amma muna saya a ciki.
Whatever he took, he must have taken it there.	Duk abin da ya dauka, tabbas ya kai shi can.
Today I went back to school.	Yau na koma makaranta.
You will call them here.	Za ku kira su a nan.
Maybe this will help.	Wataƙila wannan zai taimaka.
There was a time when she thought she felt fighting.	Akwai lokacin da ta yi tunanin ta ji fada.
I do not need your help.	Bana bukatar taimakon ku.
I can find you easily.	Zan iya samun ku cikin sauƙi.
These are the realities of life.	Waɗannan su ne ainihin abubuwan rayuwa.
I would like it.	Zan so shi.
I do not drink or smoke.	Ba na sha ko shan taba.
He makes them run now.	Ya sa su gudu yanzu.
That is not enough.	Wannan bai isa ba.
They have each other.	Suna da juna.
Happily right.	Abin farin ciki daidai ne.
He turned on the water.	Ya kunna ruwa.
I have never seen any of this in person, though.	Ban taba ganin wani daga cikin wannan a cikin mutum ba, ko da yake.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a sani ba ko wannan gaskiya ne.
We tell the story of the journey.	Muna ba da labarin tafiya.
That does not go away.	Cewa baya tafi.
Actually you are my favorite.	A gaskiya kai ne abin da na fi so.
I honestly don't understand why.	A gaskiya ban gane dalilin da ya sa ba.
Do all this yet.	Yi duk wannan tukuna.
So they don't get the help they need '.	Don haka rashin samun taimakon da suke bukata'.
You need to get out of there, man.	Kuna buƙatar fita daga wurin, mutum.
She worked in the morning.	Ta yi aiki da safe.
Maybe by making them appear early.	Wataƙila ta hanyar sa su bayyana da wuri.
But this is about more than that.	Amma wannan game da fiye da haka.
This is going right.	Wannan yana tafiya daidai.
And that may be correct.	Kuma hakan na iya zama daidai.
It must be stopped.	Dole ne a tsaya.
And let it cool down a bit.	Kuma bar shi yayi sanyi sosai.
I don't care how it is.	Ban damu da yadda take ba.
Of course, he came.	Tabbas, ya zo.
Tonight she was gone.	Daren nan ta tafi.
Do this several times.	Yi hakan sau da yawa.
Every year, everything.	Kowace shekara, komai.
We have to work best at it.	Dole ne mu yi aiki mafi kyau a ciki.
We would love to hear from you.	Za mu so mu ji daga gare ku.
To injure a person.	Don rauni ga mutum.
We can not wait for them.	Ba za mu iya jira su ba.
I do not really think so.	Ba ni da gaske tunanin haka.
He got nothing.	Bai samu komai ba.
Give them one.	Ka ba su daya.
You did that.	Kun yi haka.
That went better.	Wannan ya tafi mafi kyau.
Let’s talk about what works.	Bari mu yi magana game da abin da ke aiki.
This they failed to do.	Wannan sun kasa yi.
Something wonderful was happening.	Wani abu mai ban mamaki yana faruwa.
All is well with me.	Duk abin yayi min kyau.
We cannot buy or sell anything without it.	Ba za mu iya saya ko sayar da wani abu ba tare da shi ba.
I can only imagine what they were doing.	Zan iya tunanin abin da suke yi kawai.
It looks fine.	Da alama lafiya.
I know you're back.	Na san tabbas kun dawo.
It makes the place very nice.	Yana sa wurin yayi kyau sosai.
We are no longer here.	Ba mu ƙara zama a nan ba.
Wait a moment.	Jira na ɗan lokaci.
then I ate.	sai na ci abinci.
Do it best if you can.	Yi shi mafi kyau idan za ku iya.
I was very happy.	Na yi farin ciki sosai.
This can be achieved in the following way.	Ana iya samun wannan ta hanya mai zuwa.
In the end, he paid.	A ƙarshe, ya biya.
So, let’s show.	Don haka, bari mu nuna.
She is waiting.	Tana jira.
Boy, would it be nice if there were, though.	Yaro, zai yi kyau idan akwai, ko da yake.
Better to say no.	Gara a ce komai.
Of course, we don't want you guys to go.	Tabbas, ba ma son ku mutane ku tafi.
She showed him everything.	Ta nuna masa komai.
She prefers to be active and necessary.	Ta fi son zama mai aiki da zama dole.
And it just didn't come back.	Kuma haka kawai bai dawo ba.
Even if you are not in it now, you are in it now.	Ko da ba ka cikin yanzu, kana cikin yanzu.
I'm glad you decided to take this opportunity.	Na yi farin ciki da kuka yanke shawarar yin wannan damar.
Inside	A ciki
He knew she did not have to.	Ya san ba lallai ne ta yi hakan ba.
This does not feel good.	Wannan bai ji dadi ba.
He did nothing.	Bai yi komai ba.
But maybe it wasn't real.	Amma watakila ba ta kasance da gaske ba.
It should be.	Ya kamata ya kasance.
People love her!	Mutane suna son ta!
She will never forget that.	Ba za ta manta da hakan ba.
I really enjoyed doing it.	Na ji daɗin yin sa sosai.
How much will not be.	Nawa ba zai kasance ba.
That is why we give it to you.	Shi ya sa muke ba ku.
I will not let her go.	Ba zan sake ta ba.
Work to get.	Aiki don samun.
I know exactly what he is saying.	Na san ainihin abin da yake faɗa.
And that's where the story ends.	Kuma a nan ne labarin ya tsaya.
He can do it.	Zai iya yi.
Not who you are.	Ba ko wanene kai ba.
There are times when.	Akwai lokacin da.
It makes them feel safe.	Yana sa su ji lafiya.
So get this, and you can keep it outside.	Don haka sami wannan, kuma kuna iya ajiye shi a waje.
Of course, he can’t just leave.	Tabbas, ba zai iya barin kawai ba.
Sorry to have this injury.	Yi hakuri ya sami wannan rauni.
Now get up and go.	Yanzu ku tashi ku tafi.
This will definitely make you feel good.	Tabbas hakan zai sa ka ji dadi.
I didn't get a job because of this.	Ban samu aiki ba saboda wannan.
Maybe because he didn't care.	Wataƙila saboda bai damu ba.
This is what we know now, everyone.	Wannan shi ne abin da muka sani a yanzu, kowa da kowa.
That is, what it is.	Shi ne, abin da yake.
There are a few of these.	Akwai kaɗan daga cikin waɗannan.
I am not well.	Ba ni da lafiya.
One task at a time.	Aiki daya a lokaci guda.
We take good care of you.	Muna kula da ku sosai.
Marriage is a thing.	Aure abu ne.
He has to be honest.	Dole ne ya yi gaskiya.
The car collided with another vehicle.	Motar ta yi karo da wata motar.
It was an organized event.	Taron ne da aka shirya.
I still have to work.	Har yanzu dole in yi aiki.
He is interested in my development.	Yana sha'awar ci gaba na.
Not wanting to eat alone.	Rashin son cin abinci kadai.
Just make sure you buy one made of metal.	Kawai ka tabbata ka sayi wanda aka yi da karfe.
He feels fine.	Ya ji lafiya.
It grows in size every year.	Ya girma cikin girma kowace shekara.
But he did not answer.	Amma bai amsa ba.
But the main thing is this.	Amma babban abu shine wannan.
It is beyond you.	Ya wuce ku.
Do you like me.	Kuna so na.
He just thought.	Ya dan yi tunani.
I would never think that would happen.	Ba zan taba tunanin hakan zai faru ba.
It must be very difficult to stay with your doctor.	Dole ne ya yi wuya a zauna tare da likitan ku.
They are fast and easy.	Suna da sauri kuma da sauƙi.
He is a player.	Shi dan wasa ne.
I know, but.	Na sani, amma .
Like.	Kamar da.
But there is little of this.	Amma akwai kadan daga cikin wannan.
They can do things.	Suna iya yin abubuwa.
He thought it was good, too.	Ya dauka yana da kyau, kuma.
That is the logic.	Wannan shine hankali.
But they started to get there.	Amma sun fara isa can.
We will not accept.	Ba za mu yarda ba.
There is no one there.	Wurin babu kowa.
We missed the train.	Mun rasa jirgin kasa.
He was ready to run.	Ya shirya ya gudu.
One way is open to him.	Hanyar daya bude masa.
Think about it.	Ka yi tunani game da shi.
We are more than we are.	Mun zama fiye da wanda muke.
It can't happen.	Ba zai iya faruwa ba.
He is still here.	Har yanzu yana nan.
I looked around the room.	Na kalli sauran dakin.
The day lives another day.	Ranar tana rayuwa wata rana.
I could not see where they were, if they had gone, or what.	Ba na iya ganin inda suke, da sun tafi, ko me.
This time is very near.	Wannan lokacin yana kusa sosai.
Hurry up!	Yi sauri!
I want to know what will happen next.	Ina so in san abin da zai faru a gaba.
That's how he gets two wives.	A haka yake samun mata biyu.
I still think it already is.	Har yanzu ina tunanin riga ce.
The one who is late will get sick.	Wanda ya makara zai yi rashin lafiya.
I want to have them.	Ina son samun su.
If it doesn't last long.	Idan bai dade ba.
He never got an answer.	Bai taba samun amsa ba.
Do it right.	Yi daidai.
It is good to have something a little new.	Yana da kyau a sami wani abu ɗan sabon abu.
We were able to break through that.	Mun sami damar karya ta hakan.
I want to know if there is a way around this.	Ina so in san ko akwai wata hanya a kusa da wannan.
The rest is not easy.	Sauran ba su da sauƙi.
That was about it really.	Wannan ya kasance game da shi da gaske.
Let's look at the rest of this place.	Bari mu duba sauran wannan wuri.
Someone from there was upset.	Wani daga can ya damu.
It will not be.	Ba zai kasance ba.
In the end, life can be difficult.	A ƙarshe, rayuwa na iya zama da wahala.
It would be nice to come here and play.	Zai yi kyau a zo nan da wasa.
Hopefully you will continue to make yourself at home.	Da fatan za a ci gaba da yin kanku a gida.
Maybe that made her feel uncomfortable.	Watakila shi ya sa ta ji ba dadi.
It's not good.	Ba shi da kyau.
You can't have that.	Ba za ku iya da wannan ba.
I went.	Ina ya tafi.
I was them on the first day.	Ni ne su a ranar farko.
No one is talking.	Ba wanda ke magana.
That's what you do.	Shi ne abin da kuke yi.
They are all here!	Suna nan duka!
So we use their method.	Don haka muna amfani da hanyar su.
Do not even leave the room.	Bata ko fita daga dakin ba.
But overall thinking needs to change.	Amma gaba ɗaya tunanin yana buƙatar canza.
Is anyone there?	Akwai wani a can?
There was something else he was told to do.	Akwai wani abu kuma da aka ce ya yi.
I will go by myself.	Zan tafi da kaina.
We will not stand on this.	Ba za mu tsaya kan wannan ba.
This has been going on for almost two years.	Kusan shekaru biyu kenan ana wannan.
Obviously there is plenty of time to think about things.	Babu shakka yana da lokaci mai yawa don yin tunani a kan abubuwa.
He is mine.	Shi nawa ne.
The game is near.	Wasa na kusa ne.
Time has passed slowly.	Lokaci ya wuce a hankali.
He could not allow himself to think so.	Ya kasa barin kansa yayi tunanin haka.
I never got it or her.	Ban taba samun shi ko ita ba.
I missed what it was once.	Na rasa abin da ya kasance sau ɗaya.
Go safely.	Ku tafi lafiya.
This room is too small.	Wannan dakin kadan ne.
It annoys her.	Yana bata mata rai.
That is why it is where it is today.	Wannan shine dalilin, ita ce, inda take a yau.
We made it work.	Mun sanya shi aiki.
No one.	Babu mutum.
Go now, please.	Tafi yanzu, don Allah.
We were busy and it was a lot of fun.	Mun kasance cikin aiki kuma abin farin ciki ne sosai.
It has grown on me a lot.	Ya girma a kaina da yawa.
He too saw that it happened and did nothing.	Shi ma ya ga hakan ya faru kuma bai yi komai ba.
First.	Na farko.
I did not know that many more would do the same.	Ban san cewa wasu da yawa ma za su yi ba.
We walk a little bit.	Muna tafiya kadan tafiya.
Anyone can make a hot dog.	Kowa zai iya yin kare mai zafi.
We felt right at home, and we had everything needed.	Mun ji daidai a gida, kuma muna da duk abin da ake bukata.
I will not tell you how it was done.	Ba zan ba ku labarin yadda aka yi ba.
Read it carefully, do not make a mistake.	Karanta shi a hankali, kada ka sami kuskure.
I will lend him money though.	Zan bashi bashi ko da yake.
There are only now.	Akwai kawai yanzu.
I have to travel.	Dole in yi tafiya.
He thought about the sad day he was going to die.	Ya yi tunanin ranar bakin ciki da zai mutu.
Sit back.	Zauna baya.
So we have to go.	Don haka dole mu tafi.
Not just for me, though.	Ba don ni kawai ba, ko da yake.
I don't know how to deal with it.	Ban san yadda zan yi da shi ba.
Nothing real, nothing helpful.	Babu wani abu na gaske, babu abin taimako.
I can not explain what is happening here.	Ba zan iya bayyana abin da ke faruwa a nan ba.
Another time, he said.	Wani lokaci kuma, in ji shi.
You take a little bit of everything.	Kuna ɗaukar ɗan abu kaɗan daga komai.
I think running is not for me.	Ina tsammanin gudu ba nawa bane.
Yesterday was a surprise.	Jiya abin mamaki ne.
You can check them out, as you say, sometimes.	Kuna iya duba su, kamar yadda kuka faɗa, wani lokaci.
He was surprised.	Yayi mamakin hakan.
It seems like it was just written for me.	Kamar an rubuta mini kawai.
I can't go wrong.	Ba zan iya samun kuskure ba.
We still do.	Har yanzu muna yi.
Not just talk here.	Ba magana kawai ba a nan.
He seems to want to help her.	Da alama yana son taimaka mata.
She grew up.	Ta girma.
It should not be so.	Bai kamata ya kasance haka ba.
He was in a car.	Shi a cikin mota.
Many were overjoyed.	Mutane da yawa sun yi farin ciki sosai.
We started in the morning.	Mun fara da safe.
You should not stop on your own.	Bai kamata ku daina kan kanku ba.
When we started the place was dead.	Da muka fara wurin ya mutu.
Mealtime.	Lokacin cin abinci.
For a while, they still were.	Har zuwa wani lokaci, har yanzu suna.
But they should not be.	Amma bai kamata su kasance ba.
You don't just sit there and drink it.	Ba kawai ka zauna a can ka sha shi ba.
Work makes me work.	Aiki ya sa ni aiki.
No one can leave until he has finished eating.	Ba wanda zai iya barin har ya gama cin abinci.
Lots of interesting stuff.	Abubuwa masu ban sha'awa da yawa.
I will be happy with everything.	Zan yi farin ciki da komai.
Not a heaven she had ever seen.	Ba wani sama da ta taba gani ba.
He felt nothing.	Bai ji komai ba.
One and only.	Na daya kuma kawai.
We will talk about that later in the program.	Za mu yi magana kan hakan nan gaba a cikin shirin.
He will kill me.	Zai kashe ni.
I really recommend this.	Ina ba da shawarar wannan da gaske.
I wonder when he will return home.	Ina mamakin yaushe zai dawo gida.
But both will take you to the bottom.	Amma duka biyu za su kai ku zuwa kasa.
It is good to have trouble.	Yana da kyau a samu matsala.
You see she was right.	Ka ga ta yi daidai.
It is not finished yet.	Har yanzu ba a gama ba.
She wasn’t most people.	Ba ta kasance mafi yawan mutane ba.
This is something new.	Wannan sabon abu ne.
This purchase will be the last.	Wannan siyan zai zama na ƙarshe.
We did not come out well from this article.	Ba mu fito da kyau daga wannan labarin ba.
No one could hear her.	Ba wanda ya iya jin ta.
Then something.	Sai ga wani abu.
He did not know how to proceed.	Bai san yadda zai ci gaba ba.
Time is money.	Lokaci kudi ne.
No one bothered to work.	Babu wanda ya damu da aiki.
It works really well.	Yana aiki sosai da kyau.
He was beaten so badly that he could not walk.	An yi masa duka da rauni, ya kasa tafiya.
Not a very good job.	Babu aiki mai kyau sosai.
It is the way of life.	Ita ce hanyar rayuwa.
It must be stopped.	Dole ne a daina.
If you look.	Idan ka duba.
No need to talk.	Babu buƙatar yin magana.
There is a lot of excitement about this.	Akwai farin ciki da yawa game da wannan.
It only took one time.	Ya ɗauki lokaci ɗaya kawai.
I really don’t know what it could be.	Lallai ban san abin da zai iya zama ba.
He explained to me later.	Ya bayyana mani daga baya.
It makes life interesting.	Yana sa rayuwa mai ban sha'awa.
Do not get up too fast.	Kar ka tashi da sauri.
I wear it a little.	Na sa shi kadan.
It even shows time.	Har ma yana nuna lokaci.
I love you now.	Ina son ku yanzu.
As for the rest.	Amma ga sauran.
It is a very difficult job.	Aiki ne mai matukar wahala.
But they are not alone.	Amma ba su kadai ba.
They did not have time.	Ba su samu lokaci ba.
I'm sure of it.	Na tabbata da shi.
However, one has to live.	Duk da haka, dole ne mutum ya yi rayuwa.
Of course, it is not easy to get there.	Tabbas, ba shi da sauƙi isa wurin.
This really helped.	Wannan ya taimaka sosai.
All they have ever achieved is continued success.	Duk abin da suka taɓa samu shine ci gaba da nasara.
I wondered where she would be at this time of night.	Na yi tunanin inda za ta kasance a wannan lokaci na dare.
You can do this ahead of time.	Kuna iya yin wannan kafin lokaci.
Surprise him tonight.	Ka ba shi mamaki a daren nan.
That's all fine.	Wannan duk lafiya.
He was killed by a woman.	Wata mata ce ta kashe shi.
We can talk about something together.	Za mu iya magana game da wani abu tare.
But that is not the problem.	Amma ba wannan ba shine matsalar ba.
She wanted to forget it all.	Ta so ta manta da shi duka.
We are still talking to each other.	Har yanzu muna magana da juna.
She felt so great.	Ta ji girma sosai.
I am fine with it.	Ina lafiya da shi.
It's useless, she said.	Ba amfani, in ji ta.
That tastes really good.	Hakan yayi dadi sosai.
They met at a local restaurant.	Sun hadu a gidan cin abinci na gida.
We have to look at that.	Dole mu kalli hakan.
It is very beautiful and feminine.	Yana da kyau sosai kuma na mata.
God became man.	Allah sai ya zama mutum.
I wonder what will happen in two months.	Ina tunanin me zai faru nan da wata biyu.
They have to go.	Dole ne su tafi.
It has often been for me to do this.	Ya sau da yawa a gare ni yin wannan.
We but what would not ask him.	Mu amma me ba zai tambaye shi ba.
That was the case.	Haka abin ya kasance.
Let him be surprised.	Bari yayi mamaki.
Although, they are two years now, at most.	Ko da yake, sun kasance shekaru biyu a yanzu, a mafi yawa.
It grows every year.	Yana girma girma kowace shekara.
She did nothing.	Ba ta yi komai ba.
That will not do.	Wannan ba zai yi ba.
We are afraid of not getting enough or getting what we can.	Muna tsoron rashin samun isa ko samun abin da za mu iya.
I love it when people do that.	Ina son shi idan mutane suka yi haka.
It doesn't really stop there.	Ba da gaske ya daina ba.
It was a good time.	Lokaci ne mai kyau.
We will have people on you day and night.	Za mu sami mutane a kan ku dare da rana.
I know that is not good.	Na san hakan ba shi da kyau.
Not sure what the first one is.	Ban tabbata menene na farko ba.
From there somewhere.	Daga can wani wuri.
Not close, but close.	Ba kusa ba, amma kusa.
Go slowly, and be careful.	Ku tafi a hankali, kuma ku yi hankali.
This is easy too.	Wannan yana da sauƙi ma.
We want to know what happened.	Muna so mu san abin da ya faru.
But then he heard something.	Amma sai ya ji wani abu.
However.	Duk da haka.
It makes things happen.	Yana sa abubuwa su faru.
He would never get this bad.	Ba zai taɓa samun wannan mummunan ba.
Sometimes it is cold.	Wani lokacin sanyi ne.
She won't even say it.	Ita ma ba za ta faɗa ba.
Would you like to get involved with this?	Kuna son hannu da wannan?
It was something I got up to for myself.	Wani abu ne na tashi a gare ni.
Can anyone help me with this.	Shin wani zai iya taimaka mini da wannan.
But nothing.	Amma babu komai .
We are so close.	Mun kusa haka.
Being human is to be lost.	Zama mutum shine a rasa.
Hear my child.	Ji yaro na.
They must know where it comes from.	Dole ne su san inda ya fito.
I did not see life.	Ban ga rai ba.
He was each man to himself.	Ya kasance kowane mutum don kansa.
This swim was, surprisingly, fun.	Wannan iyo ya kasance, abin mamaki, mai daɗi.
I did not show him your work, of course.	Ban nuna masa aikin ku ba, tabbas.
I agree with what you are saying	Na yarda da abin da kuke faɗa
Everything will be known soon.	Nan da nan za a san komai.
Certainly not where I expected it to be.	Tabbas ba inda na zata ba.
Let me put it another way.	Bari in sanya shi wata hanya.
It is generally not true.	Gaba ɗaya ba gaskiya ba ne.
He never said no.	Bai taba fada ba.
We have done this before.	Mun yi haka a baya.
Like you are in it or something.	Kamar kana cikin sa ko wani abu.
I personally do not want to have anything to do with them.	Ni da kaina ba na son in sami abin yi da su.
And he said something interesting.	Kuma ya ce wani abu mai ban sha'awa.
It's good, but not great.	Yana da kyau, amma ba mai girma ba.
Think carefully.	Ka yi tunani a hankali.
This will be done tomorrow.	Za a yi wannan a gobe.
They are sad.	Sun yi bakin ciki.
And maybe not.	Kuma watakila ba.
It can not be.	Ba za ta iya zama ba.
It rains sometimes but not really.	Ana yin ruwan sama wani lokaci amma ba ruwan sama na gaske.
In fact, it can be devastating.	A gaskiya, yana iya zama mummunan hakan.
My past is all over since then.	Abubuwan da na baya duka sun wuce tun daga lokacin.
I will continue to do so.	Zan ci gaba da ci gaba da wannan.
There is only one, you see.	Akwai daya kawai, ka gani.
I read about it.	Na karanta game da shi.
It was the only thing she could think of.	Shi ne kawai abin da ta iya tunani.
I have the rest of the story.	Ina sauran labarin.
She let it happen.	Ta bari ya faru.
It is finally.	Yana a ƙarshe.
Why do you think this happened?	Me yasa kuke ganin hakan ya faru?
This is what we say.	Wannan shi ne abin da muke faɗa.
She made a mistake.	Ta yi kuskure.
I think there must be something 'wrong' with me.	Ina tsammanin tabbas akwai wani abu 'kuskure' tare da ni.
Place the dining area in front.	Sanya wurin cin abinci a gaba.
Otherwise they will keep coming.	In ba haka ba za su ci gaba da zuwa.
I love them so much and I want them to be happy.	Ina son su sosai kuma ina son su yi farin ciki.
We talk about everything.	Muna magana akan komai.
I had to look at them to see what it was.	Dole ne in duba su in ga menene.
The method is as follows.	Hanyar ita ce kamar haka.
I would like a boat	Ina son jirgin ruwa
That's what they tell me.	Abin da suke gaya mani ke nan.
This is often a problem.	Wannan idan sau da yawa matsala.
And you should be, too.	Kuma ya kamata ku kasance, ma.
You want to learn something and they want to learn something else.	Kuna so ku koyi wani abu kuma suna son su koyi wani abu kuma.
He is very happy about that.	Yayi matukar farin ciki da hakan.
Soon, the truth will come out.	Nan da nan, gaskiya za ta fito.
This is a bad job.	Wannan mummunan aiki ne.
This is unknown.	Wannan ba a sani ba.
He knew the man better than anyone else.	Ya fi kowa sanin mutumin.
They do not work well alone.	Ba sa aiki da kyau su kaɗai.
A few years later, they were married.	Bayan wasu shekaru, an yi aure.
And it is not.	Kuma ba haka ba ne.
It is not true.	Ba gaskiya ba ne.
We do not know how.	Ba mu san yadda ba.
The police will not come here.	'Yan sanda ba za su zo nan ba.
It's not something we think is appropriate.	Ba wani abu ne da muke tunanin ya dace ba.
You are beautiful.	Kuna da kyau.
He did not think of anything.	Bai yi tunanin komai ba.
They should not make you sick.	Kada su sa ku rashin lafiya.
It happens.	Yana faruwa.
He refused to listen.	Ya ƙi jin.
I do not usually get up early.	Ban saba tashi da wuri ba.
I never really cared when it happened.	Ban taba kula sosai a lokacin da abin ke faruwa ba.
Not much is known at the time.	Ba a san da yawa ba a wannan lokacin.
We have no word.	Ba mu da wata magana.
Take one.	Dauki daya.
The fish are delicious!	Kifi sun yi dadi!
Don’t worry about time.	Kada ku damu da lokaci.
She felt like she had just made progress.	Ta ji kamar ta dan samu ci gaba.
Maybe he will.	Wataƙila zai yi.
He does what he does, and he enjoys doing it.	Yana yin abin da yake yi, kuma yana jin daɗin yin shi.
You have never seen such happy children.	Ba ka taba ganin yara masu farin ciki irin wannan ba.
That seems to be the case.	Da alama hakan ya bayyana.
They sat down.	Suka zauna.
We were scared.	Mun ji tsoron tsoro.
I will not pass it by.	Ba zan wuce shi ba.
He still has work to do.	Har yanzu yana da sauran aiki.
They showed me the way out.	Sun nuna min hanyar fita.
First, we save water.	Na daya, muna ajiye ruwa.
But that has changed somehow.	Amma ya canza ko ta yaya.
The work is minimal.	Aikin yayi kadan.
She wondered if it showed.	Ta yi tunanin ko ya nuna.
I will kill myself.	Zan kashe kaina.
They read like someone is talking to you.	Suka karanta kamar wani yana magana da ku.
I don't want to say more.	Ba na son ƙarin faɗa.
I think it will come later.	Ina tsammanin zai zo daga baya.
How can I do that.	Ta yaya zan iya yin hakan.
A great deal of effort has been put into all of this.	An yi ƙoƙari sosai a cikin duk wannan.
Of course, the kids are back.	Tabbas, yara suna baya.
I'm waiting for him to come back.	Ina jira ya dawo.
Here is the original article.	Ga ainihin labarin.
If it’s cold, everyone says it is.	Idan ya yi sanyi, kowa ya ce yana da.
But he got more, he got bigger.	Amma ya samu yawa, ya fi girma.
People don't think very well.	Mutane ba sa tunani sosai.
I would not be surprised.	Ba zan yi mamaki ba.
We will not send anyone.	Ba za mu aika kowa ba.
This person has no one.	Wannan mutumin ba shi da kowa.
I will be there again.	Zan kasance a can kuma.
He keeps walking.	Yana ci gaba da tafiya.
They work really well too.	Suna aiki da gaske kuma.
This is not always true.	Wannan ba koyaushe gaskiya bane.
Will you be here next week?	Za ku zo nan mako mai zuwa?
We started waiting.	Muka fara jira.
I am crying a lot.	Ina kuka sosai.
Something went wrong.	An yi wani irin kuskure.
He can accept this and never think again.	Zai iya yarda da wannan kuma kada ya sake tunani.
Now, he is gone.	Yanzu, tabbas ya tafi.
He heard that name somewhere.	Ya ji wannan sunan a wani wuri.
I know it's a problem.	Na san yana da matsala.
I found out quickly.	Na gano hakan da sauri.
Something more is happening, however.	Wani abu fiye da haka yana faruwa, duk da haka.
I love that about you.	Ina son hakan game da ku.
The game seems to have changed from that moment on.	Wasan kamar ya canza daga wannan lokacin.
No one lived there.	Babu wanda ya zauna a wurin.
Talk about a big job.	Yi magana game da babban aiki.
I have to go to work.	Dole ne in tafi aiki.
However, it is not easy.	Duk da haka, ba shi da sauƙi.
I think it's just good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau kawai.
I think what they are doing to you is wrong.	Ina ganin abin da suke yi muku kuskure ne.
Check it out below !.	Duba shi a kasa!.
Maybe I'm running in the rain.	Wataƙila ina gudu cikin ruwan sama.
He is my dog.	Shine kare na.
It makes me a better player.	Yana sa ni zama dan wasa mafi kyau.
She told me she would never work.	Ta ce da ni ba za ta taba yin aiki ba.
Let me hear you closer.	Bari in ji ka kusa.
So it must be very comfortable.	Don haka tabbas yana jin daɗi sosai.
I said, that's not good.	Na ce, wannan bai yi kyau ba.
If she wants to.	Idan tana so.
Let him do what he is supposed to do.	Bari ya yi abin da ya kamata ya yi.
I am very happy to do this project.	Ina matukar farin cikin yin wannan aikin.
No one walks on water.	Ba wanda ke tafiya akan ruwa.
Surprisingly, you say.	Abin mamaki, ka ce.
You came on the road that's it.	Ka zo kan hanya shi ke nan.
It's about difficulty.	Yana da game da wahala.
The weekend will be hot and humid.	Karshen karshen mako zai kasance mai zafi da zafi.
I check the time.	Ina duba lokaci.
I'm sure you want to save it.	Na tabbata kuna so ku ajiye shi.
They would have found that place.	Da sun sami wannan wurin.
Mind is a weak thing.	Hankali abu ne mai rauni.
I'm not too worried.	Ban damu ba sosai.
It's been two years.	Shekara biyu kenan.
This is like, useless.	Wannan kamar, rashin amfani.
The venue has been moved.	An canza wurin taron.
One must learn to live with the problem.	Dole ne mutum ya koyi rayuwa tare da matsalar.
Maybe they want to put thought into it.	Wataƙila suna son sanya tunani a ciki.
After that, nothing will change.	Bayan haka, babu abin da zai canza.
I have never heard of him.	Ban taba jin irin sa ba.
There isn’t much to do.	Babu wani abu da yawa da zai yi.
But we are dead.	Amma mun mutu.
They have to come out every month.	Dole ne su fito kowane wata.
Talk to him inside.	Yi masa magana ta ciki.
You are very busy and want to know what lies ahead.	Kuna da aiki sosai kuma kuna son sanin abin da ke gaba.
They make no money.	Ba sa samun kuɗi.
The rain was faster than it was last night.	Ruwan sama ya yi sauri fiye da yadda aka yi a daren jiya.
You talked to me, you gave me attention.	Kun yi magana da ni, kun ba ni hankali.
He missed something.	Ya bata wani abu.
This is something new.	Wannan sabon abu ne.
I know exactly what she wants.	Na san ainihin abin da take so.
It was fun and exciting.	Ya kasance mai daɗi da ban sha'awa.
Only a child.	Yaro ne kawai.
But that is not what happened.	Amma ba haka ya faru ba.
It has nothing.	Bata da komai.
We went everything.	Mun je komai.
Tell him what to do and what to do.	Ka gaya masa abin da zai yi kuma ya yi.
Buy fresh fish.	Sayi sabon kifi.
They do not care.	Ba su damu ba.
It is difficult to know what is going on.	Yana da wuya a san abin da ake ciki.
Now, enough is enough.	Yanzu, isa ya isa.
There are other things, though.	Akwai wasu abubuwa, ko da yake.
It's hard to hear though.	Babu wuya ji ko da yake.
I love it, he said.	Ina son shi, in ji shi.
If you do not feel comfortable, do something about it.	Idan ba ka ji daɗi, yi wani abu game da shi.
He was so stunned that he could not speak.	Mamaki ne ya kama shi har ya kasa magana.
In the morning she saw the doctor.	Da safe ta ga likitan.
She made no mistake about it.	Ba ta yi kuskure game da shi ba.
Who wants you to see who you are.	Wanene yake son ku ga wanene ku.
I do not want to be arrested.	Ban so a kama ni ba.
For me, that has everything.	A gare ni, wannan yana da komai.
Then go outside.	Sai ka fita waje.
She was careful, after all.	Ta yi hankali, bayan haka.
He doesn't talk much.	Ba shi da yawan magana.
It is completely healthy.	Yana da lafiya gaba ɗaya.
I hope you do too !.	Ina fatan za ku yi haka!.
No outside food is allowed inside.	Babu abincin waje da aka yarda a ciki.
But there is certainly no one, not even one.	Amma tabbas babu ko ɗaya, ko kaɗan fiye da haka.
There will be a few.	Za a yi kaɗan.
I'm really sorry, but.	Na yi hakuri da gaske, amma .
Or you don't have one.	Ko ba ku da daya.
Below.	A kasa.
That's what he wants to do.	Abin da ya ke son yi ke nan.
He waited but no one answered.	Ya jira amma ba wanda ya amsa.
I know how this works.	Na san yadda wannan ke aiki.
You do not need much, but you must have two or three.	Ba ku buƙatar da yawa, amma dole ne ku sami biyu ko uku.
It must be exciting to find out.	Dole ne ya zama abin farin ciki don gano hakan.
You get a lot of help.	Kuna samun taimako mai yawa.
She is so much better.	Ta fi ta sosai.
I did not know that.	Ban san hakan ba.
Hence the mistake.	Saboda haka kuskure.
His ugliness was terrifying.	Mummunan sa ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
They want to do it there.	Suna son yin shi a can.
To move forward.	Don tafiya gaba.
Just an amazing trip !.	Kawai tafiya mai ban mamaki!.
Do you have a dog?	Kuna da kare?
She got already with everything.	Ta samu riga da komai.
They do not want to be recognized.	Ba sa son a gane su.
We found a little bit about it.	Mun sami ɗan abu game da shi.
O world.	Ya duniya.
He would not be expected to think anything.	Ba za a yi tsammanin zai yi tunanin komai ba.
We really want to make this work.	Muna matukar son sanya wannan aiki.
He just went.	Ya tafi kawai.
It is a time of optimism.	Lokaci ne na kyakkyawan fata.
He was as serious to her now as he was then.	Ya kasance da gaske a gare ta a yanzu kamar yadda yake a lokacin.
Only you and the children.	Kai da yara kawai.
It was a close thing.	Ya kasance abu na kusa.
He would not say how.	Ba zai ce ta yaya ba.
We still have not made much progress.	Har yanzu ba mu sami ci gaba da yawa ba.
Until the end of the year.	Har zuwa karshen shekara.
She is always busy.	Kullum tana cikin aiki.
And it is still there today.	Kuma akwai shi har yau.
I do not do that.	Ba na yin haka.
However, they did not eat again.	Duk da haka, ba su sake ci ba.
So it doesn’t seem like a pleasure.	Don haka ba kamar abin jin daɗi ba ne.
I'll wait until then.	Zan jira har sai lokacin.
It may come as a surprise to many.	Yana iya zama abin mamaki ga mutane da yawa.
He cannot go on.	Ba zai iya wuce gaba ba.
Of course you want to play this game again.	Tabbas kuna son sake buga wannan wasan.
No, he will not.	A'a, ba zai yi ba.
We agree with everyone.	Mun yarda da kowa.
Eating is God's work.	Cin abinci aikin Allah ne.
He did not know what was happening.	Bai san me ke faruwa ba.
He already knows that, of course.	Ya riga ya san hakan, ba shakka.
We don't like that.	Ba ma son wannan.
And for a while, that happened.	Kuma har zuwa wani lokaci, hakan ya faru.
You will lose it quickly.	Za ku rasa shi da sauri.
I have some things to do though.	Ina da wasu abubuwan da zan yi duk da haka.
At least it was.	Ko kadan ya kasance.
It’s a tool, a way.	Kayan aiki ne, hanya.
I have a feeling too.	Ina da ji kuma.
We should let you get what you want now.	Ya kamata mu bar ku ku sami abin da kuke so yanzu.
The game is right.	Wasan dama ce.
I was there so.	Na kasance a wurin don haka.
What, it is better.	Menene, ya fi kyau.
This is not a difficult task.	Wannan ba aiki ne mai wahala ba.
Do it right.	Yi shi ya yi.
Use oil carefully.	Yi amfani da mai a hankali.
And they died.	Kuma sun mutu.
He will not kill but he can be killed.	Ba zai kashe ba amma ana iya kashe shi.
You answered me.	Kun amsa min.
I don't want anyone to know.	Bana son kowa ya sani.
Better late than never.	Gara a makara fiye da taba.
An idea came to her instantly.	Wani tunani ya zo mata nan take.
We prepared it.	Mun shirya shi.
You can find what you want there.	Kuna iya samun abin da kuke so a can.
Maybe this is a good thing.	Wataƙila wannan abu ne mai kyau.
This will take some time.	Hakan zai dauki lokaci kadan.
I'll find out.	Zan gano.
But there is still nothing that anyone can do.	Amma har yanzu babu wani abu da kowa zai iya yi.
I'm tired of doing that.	Na gaji da yin hakan.
She was like.	Ta kasance kamar.
He ate dinner.	Ya ci abincin dare.
They win.	Suna cin nasara.
In fact, they have a lot to lose.	A gaskiya ma, suna da yawa da za su rasa.
Although you may feel comfortable, you should take it easy.	Ko da yake kuna iya jin daɗi, ya kamata ku ɗauki shi cikin sauƙi.
She raised her hand and passed.	Ta daga hannu ta wuce.
We must prepare for tomorrow.	Dole ne mu shirya gobe.
But it is not.	Amma ba haka ba.
Prove a person.	Tabbatar da wani mutum.
So he will definitely come back here.	Don haka tabbas zai dawo nan.
Take time to admire everything here.	Ɗauki lokaci don sha'awar duk abin da ke nan.
Only you can do this for me.	Kai kaɗai za ka iya yi mini wannan.
I thought of something to ask him.	Na yi tunanin wani abu da zan tambaye shi.
After a while he died.	Bayan ɗan lokaci ya mutu.
He is such a sweet person.	Mutum ne mai dadi haka.
God knows them.	Allah Ya san su.
But don't tell me.	Amma kar ka gaya mani.
Great place.	Babban wuri.
This is a big house.	Wannan babban gida ne.
Maybe one of us should be killed.	Wataƙila a kashe wani daga cikin mu.
So is the world.	Haka duniya take.
You have to explain what it is.	Dole ne ku bayyana abin da yake.
Of course, he would go out and play, just for fun.	Tabbas, zai fita ya yi wasa, don jin daɗi.
And we will.	Kuma za mu.
I can't leave you here.	Ba zan iya barin ku a nan ba.
Maybe I didn't even play the third game.	Wataƙila ma ban buga wasan na uku ba.
But he is not here.	Amma ba ya nan.
Not when he is back now.	Ba lokacin da ya dawo yanzu ba.
Until then, stop.	Har ya kai, tsaya.
But she must find time.	Amma dole ne ta sami lokaci.
He did not want her to know.	Bai so ta sani ba.
You are right.	Kun yi daidai.
It will not take much.	Ba zai ɗauki yawa ba.
We tried most of everything.	Mun gwada mafi yawan komai.
It is not clear whether we can do this.	Ba a bayyana cewa za mu iya yin wannan ba.
They say no problem.	Suka ce ba matsala.
But it is not coming.	Amma bata zuwa.
I want to do more.	Ina so in kara yin hakan.
But she will not give up.	Amma ba za ta daina ba.
There is no way to explain it more than that.	Babu yadda za a yi a bayyana shi fiye da haka.
Can't wait to see that.	Ba za a iya jira don ganin hakan ba.
I am very happy about that.	Ina matukar farin ciki da hakan.
You can see what you like.	Kuna iya ganin abin da kuke so.
He did not know how long it would take him to stop.	Bai san tsawon lokacin da zai iya sa ta tsaya ba.
I have not seen it yet.	Ban gani ba tukuna.
But it feels like a song.	Amma yana jin kamar waƙa.
Somehow he missed something.	Ko ta yaya ya rasa wani abu.
I hope you have a good time here.	Ina fata kuna da kyakkyawan lokaci a nan.
This may be so.	Wannan yana iya zama haka.
I will be late.	Zan makara.
You must tell everyone.	Dole ne ku gaya wa kowa.
I felt it was really good.	Na ji yana da kyau sosai.
Need more?	Kuna buƙatar ƙarin?
After a while he became a man.	Bayan wani lokaci ya zama mutum.
He himself did not have a child.	Shi kansa bai yi yaro ba.
And open about it too.	Kuma bude game da shi ma.
You two.	Ku biyu.
This is not a good sign.	Wannan ba alama ce mai kyau ba.
He never got it.	Bai taba samu ba.
But you know how it is.	Amma ka san yadda abin yake.
I still have a lot of work to do.	Har yanzu ina da sauran aiki da yawa.
I don't know exactly how to do that.	Ban san ainihin yadda zan yi hakan ba.
Now it is clear.	Yanzu ya tabbata.
And how they did it.	Da ma yadda suka yi.
Not for me.	Ba don ni ba.
He is your son.	Dan ku ne.
After all, they are together.	Bayan haka, suna tare.
That would be nice.	Da hakan yayi kyau.
She stopped talking.	Ta daina magana.
Including making.	Ciki har da yin.
All inside were fine, no problem.	Duk ciki sun kasance lafiya, babu matsala.
Now I am trying to do this.	Yanzu ina ƙoƙarin yin wannan.
Using a car on a train?	Amfani da mota a kan jirgin kasa?
This material is not suitable for use.	Wannan kayan bai dace da amfani ba.
John sees this.	John yana ganin wannan.
A pleasant feeling.	Wani dadi ji.
It's a really good thing.	Abu ne mai kyau gaske.
This is very good.	Wannan yana da kyau sosai.
Get up early and run now, before he catches you.	Ka tashi da wuri ka gudu yanzu, kafin ya kama ka.
I know the truth better than anyone else.	Ni na fi kowa sanin gaskiya.
The most interesting way.	Hanya mafi ban sha'awa.
And be funny.	Kuma ku zama mai ban dariya.
Need more than anything.	Bukatar fiye da komai.
And they are not much involved.	Kuma ba su da yawa shiga.
Something he would never do.	Wani abu da ba zai taba yi ba.
Only one night.	Dare daya kawai.
We didn’t do that, of course.	Ba mu yi haka ba, ba shakka.
Growing up.	Girma mutum.
Don't worry too much.	Kar ku damu sosai.
But they are still fighting.	Amma duk da haka suna ta fada.
The player who won first.	Dan wasan da ya yi nasara da farko.
Or to get what they did not get.	Ko don samun abin da ba su samu ba.
It made me cry.	Ya sanya ni kuka.
I think he can wait.	Ina tsammanin zai iya jira.
Next he went back to the other end of the room.	Gaba ya koma can can karshen dakin.
He was a reader.	Ya kasance mai karatu.
Something changed for you that day.	Wani abu ya canza muku ranar.
You may even have other people living in your home.	Kuna iya ma samun wasu mutane da ke zaune a gidan ku.
I am very happy and hope you can see.	Ina matukar farin ciki da fatan za ku iya gani.
She knows the kind.	Ta san irin su.
This house is bigger than just one person.	Wannan gidan ya fi girma ga mutum ɗaya kawai.
But we will see what happens.	Amma za mu ga abin da ya faru.
He remembers how he felt.	Ya tuna yadda ya ke ji.
And some of them are killed.	Kuma ana kashe wasu daga ciki.
Or so everyone says.	Ko haka kowa ya ce.
He wondered how he would fare.	Ya yi tunanin ta yaya zai kai.
And they didn't.	Kuma ba su yi ba.
And there is a lot about that.	Kuma akwai abubuwa da yawa game da hakan.
Twice, in the same way.	Sau biyu, a cikin hanya guda.
They did not.	Ba su yi ba.
He started walking.	Ya fara tafiya.
So there you are, as they usually say.	Don haka akwai ku, kamar yadda suka saba faɗa.
Do it anyway.	Yi shi duk da haka.
He could never really talk to him.	Ba zai taɓa iya magana da shi da gaske ba.
But now it is over.	Amma yanzu ya kare.
Do you think how many people live here?	Shin kuna tunanin mutane nawa ne ke zaune a nan?
There is no mistake.	Babu wurin kuskure.
It should be read aloud.	Ya kamata a karanta karatu.
What could be the problem?	Me zai iya zama wannan matsala.
And it's great.	Kuma yana da girma.
I didn’t do much homework at first.	Ban yi aikin gida da yawa ba a farko.
He died two years later.	Hakan ya mutu tsawon shekaru biyu.
And say so.	Kuma ka ce haka.
She could not do anything happy.	Ta kasa yin abin farin ciki.
He knew what she was going to do.	Ya san abin da za ta yi.
Not done for years.	Ba a yi shekaru ba.
I had to bring it myself.	Dole ne in kawo shi da kaina.
You do not have these.	Ba ku da waɗannan.
Today, it is very little.	A yau, yana da kadan sosai.
Where did they go? 	Ina suka je?
he thought.	yayi tunani.
We think that if he hears the truth, it must be true.	Muna tunanin cewa idan ya ji gaskiya, tabbas gaskiya ne.
She just thought.	Ta dan yi tunani.
It's a pleasure for me.	Abin farin ciki ne a gare ni.
It was a very nice day.	Ta kasance wata rana mai kyau sosai.
She knows very well now how it feels.	Ta san sosai yanzu yadda abin yake ji.
It moves very slowly.	Yana tafiya da sauri a hankali.
Think about your plan.	Yi tunani game da shirin ku.
Every player has one.	Kowane dan wasa yana da daya.
This is what you do best.	Abin da kuka fi yi ke nan.
I will help you catch it.	Zan taimake ka ka kama shi.
Sometimes they just want more money.	Wani lokaci suna son ƙarin kuɗi kawai.
He fell asleep because, like you, he was very sick.	Ya yi barci saboda kamar ku, ya yi rashin lafiya sosai.
And maybe even a passion to play.	Kuma watakila ma sha'awar yin wasa.
It took a lot of effort even for him.	Ya ɗauki ƙoƙari sosai har ma a gare shi.
With apologies, he changed the channel.	Tare da ba da hakuri, ya canza tashar.
The next one stopped.	Na gaba ya tsaya.
It may be that there is a.	Yana iya zama cewa akwai a.
And the one we call is not home.	Kuma wanda muka kira ba ya gida.
He said well.	Ya fada da kyau.
No one wants to talk.	Babu wanda yake son yin magana.
But they could not help it.	Amma sun kasa taimaka.
It shows her that you care.	Ya nuna mata cewa kana kula.
Do not waste water.	Kar a bata ruwa.
No deadline has been set.	Ba a sanya ranar ƙarshe ba.
Immediately the story went down.	Nan da nan labarin ya tafi kasa.
Health problems.	Matsalar lafiya.
It just happened there.	Ya faru ne kawai a wurin.
That is why they need it.	Shi ya sa suke bukata.
They are a little late.	Sun dan makara.
It was also quickly won.	Haka kuma cikin sauri aka ci nasara.
This, however, is not necessary.	Wannan, duk da haka, ba lallai ba ne.
It suits me.	Ya dace da ni.
Just call us.	Kawai a kira mu.
I love her.	Ina son ta.
Get people to take care of you.	Ka sa mutane su kula da kai.
It is a lie.	Karya ce.
We did not, man.	Ba mu yi ba, mutum.
Fear of things coming back.	Tsoron kada abubuwan su dawo.
Of course I will stay in this house again.	Tabbas zan sake zama a wannan gidan.
None of this.	Babu daya daga cikin wannan.
I made money	Na yi kudi
We just.	Mu kawai.
I found it very interesting.	Na sami abin ban sha'awa sosai.
Something terrible happened.	Wani mummunan abu ya faru.
It is not safe to drink this water.	Ba lafiya shan wannan ruwan ba.
I can not, not how he can.	Ba zan iya ba, ba yadda zai iya ba.
I am life	Ni ne rayuwa
They said he would be back tonight.	Suka ce a daren nan zai dawo.
He stayed safe.	Ya zauna lafiya.
It just so happens.	Kawai sai ya faru.
You will understand.	Za ku gane.
There is no way out.	Babu wata hanyar fita.
It did not work.	Bai yi aiki ba.
Tools needed to be tested.	Ana buƙatar gwada kayan aikin.
He is waiting.	Yana jira.
I read your advice carefully.	Na karanta shawarar ku a hankali.
Stay home for dinner.	Kasance a gida don samun abincin dare.
If so.	Idan kuma.
It's necessary.	Ya zama dole.
They keep doing this.	Suna ci gaba da yin wannan.
I highly recommend it.	Ina ba da shawarar shi sosai.
And if we can, others can.	Kuma idan za mu iya, wasu za su iya yi.
We would like it completed as soon as possible.	Za mu so a gama shi da sauri.
This makes it even harder.	Wannan yana ƙara wahala.
Not as it happened.	Ba kamar yadda ya faru ba.
But she went that day.	Amma ta tafi ranar.
Be very careful!	Yi hankali sosai!
However, it can.	Duk da haka, yana iya.
She would have been here.	Da ma tana nan.
You did not come.	Ba ku zo ba.
Hey, smoker.	Kai, mai shan taba.
There is no way around that.	Babu wata hanya a kusa da wannan.
It's three o'clock.	Tashi uku ne.
For those who have children you know.	Ga wanda ke da yara kun san shi.
This is my favorite movie.	Wannan shine fim ɗin da na fi so.
We will not call.	Ba za mu kira ba.
It took a while.	Ya ɗauki ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
There is only one way to find out what happened.	Akwai hanya ɗaya kawai don gano abin da ya faru.
It will be easy to quit.	Zai zama da sauƙi a daina.
When he plays, he gets very tired.	Idan yana wasa, sai ya gaji sosai.
Let's do something.	Bari mu yi wani abu.
I try to see myself in the crowd.	Ina ƙoƙarin ganin kaina a cikin taron.
Whatever you suspect.	Duk abin da kuke zargin.
But don't stop there.	Amma kar a tsaya nan.
She worked slowly throughout the work day.	Ta yi aiki a hankali a duk tsawon ranar aiki.
Others said they did nothing.	Wasu kuma suka ce ba su yi komai ba.
But we see that it is a good thing to do.	Amma mun ga cewa hakan abu ne mai kyau a yi.
It would be very sad to lose them from the world.	Zai zama abin bakin ciki sosai in rasa su daga duniya.
We are very happy.	Muna jin daɗi sosai.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
And they keep coming.	Kuma suna ci gaba da zuwa.
And the house.	Kuma gidan.
I think he committed suicide.	Ina tsammanin ya kashe kansa.
Not really needed.	Ba a buƙatar gaske.
I think something is wrong.	Ina tsammanin wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
I can't find more.	Ba zan iya neman ƙarin ba.
She stopped talking.	Ta tsaya magana.
It's late, and everyone is home.	Dare yayi, kowa ya koma gida.
I think he just decided to get involved.	Ina tsammanin kawai ya yanke shawarar shiga.
Only if you want of course.	Sai kawai idan kuna so ba shakka.
She was ready to go and start.	Ta shirya ta je ta fara.
But he did not come again.	Amma bai sake zuwa ba.
I didn’t take a chance.	Ban dauki dama ba.
She looked for help.	Ta duba don neman taimako.
I could not get inside.	Na kasa shiga ciki.
She is definitely not.	Ta tabbata babu.
No one prepared their food.	Babu wanda ya shirya abincin su.
Or you may not know what to do.	Ko wataƙila ba ku san abin da za ku yi ba.
And it's just water.	Kuma ruwa ne kawai.
He is a very intelligent man.	Mutum ne mai hankali.
He sat down and looked.	Ya zauna ya duba.
But first things first.	Amma farko abubuwa da farko.
How long has he been planning this?	Tun yaushe ya ke shirin haka?
The interest was greater.	Sha'awa ta kasance mafi girma.
I don’t see what’s going on, though.	Ban ga abin da ke faruwa ba, ko da yake.
She told me she loved music.	Ta gaya min cewa tana son waƙa.
Amazingly, both like you.	Abin ban mamaki, duka biyu kamar ku.
So, too, he speaks a second time.	Don haka, ma, yana yin magana ta biyu.
Work is being done on this.	Ana aiki akan wannan.
The first meal should be simple.	Abincin farko ya kamata ya zama mai sauƙi.
This flight is empty.	Wannan jirgin babu kowa.
Now I will fix people.	Yanzu zan gyara mutane.
He is looking for you.	Yana neman ku.

Near my age.	Kusa da shekaru na.
Time is running out, even if there is work to be done.	Lokaci yana tafiya, ko da akwai aikin da za a yi.
Keep doing this.	Ci gaba da yin wannan.
The film captures the attention.	Fim ɗin yana ɗaukar hankali.
Hopefully it will be done.	Da fatan za a yi.
She is better than me.	Ta fi ni kyau.
And it worked well from the start.	Kuma yayi aiki da kyau tun daga farko.
And he got it.	Kuma ya samu.
He is the man.	Shi ne mutumin.
I do not know this.	Ban san wannan ba.
People are only concerned with material things.	Mutane sun damu da abin duniya kawai.
Women waited longer than enough.	Mata sun jira fiye da isa.
Stand close to him.	Ku tsaya kusa da shi.
So for me it was a success.	Don haka a gare ni nasara ce.
This is not about the future, the future now.	Wannan ba wani abu bane game da gaba, gaba a yanzu.
He felt sad.	Ya ji bakin ciki.
There are so many girls.	Akwai 'yan mata da yawa.
So we can live without fear.	Don haka za mu iya rayuwa ba tare da tsoro ba.
It has to happen.	Dole ne ya faru.
She could not understand how.	Ta kasa gane yaya.
She added.	Ta kara yi.
They will belong to anyone who decides to read it.	Za su kasance na duk wanda ya yanke shawarar karanta shi.
But join.	Amma shiga.
She was human.	Ta kasance mutum.
It has no chance.	Ba shi da dama.
People are getting married in it.	Mutane suna yin aure a ciki.
But try to look for the good in others.	Amma ku yi ƙoƙari ku nemi abubuwa masu kyau kuma.
It's in a bad place.	Yana cikin mummunan wuri.
It was rejected.	An ƙi shi.
I must not die.	Dole ne in mutu ba.
If it is not one thing, it is another.	Idan ba abu daya ba ne, wani abu ne.
She confirmed.	Ta tabbatar.
They talk about how they love this simple life.	Suna magana game da yadda suke son wannan rayuwa mai sauƙi.
I do not know how it will be.	Ban san yadda za ta kasance ba.
We did not.	Ba mu yi ba.
Slowly she opened the door.	A hankali ta bude kofar.
She didn't feel anything.	Bata ji komai ba.
Which is not good, but it is also not good.	Wanda ba shi da kyau, amma kuma ba shi da kyau.
Hear my cry.	Ji kuka na.
Couldn't find one.	An kasa samun daya.
Absolutely.	Lallai.
A month later, he thought again.	Bayan wata daya, ya sake tunani.
During this time, you will work every day.	A wannan lokacin, za ku yi aiki kowace rana.
They do very well.	Suna yin kyau sosai.
I am very tired today.	Na gaji sosai yau.
But yes !!!.	Amma a!!!.
Wait until you are well.	Jira har sai kun kasance lafiya.
I told them to play.	Na ce su yi wasa.
It was fun for us.	Ya ji daɗi a gare mu.
Leave her alone.	Ku bar mata daga ciki.
I saw them doing that.	Na ga suna yin haka.
You know better than them.	Kun san fiye da su.
She has three children.	Tana da yaya uku.
He too can get it.	Shi ma yana iya samu.
We made them as follows.	Mun sanya su kamar haka.
But not easy.	Amma ba mai sauƙi ba.
You seem to have got your chance.	Da alama kun sami damar ku.
We have to work now.	Dole ne mu yi aiki yanzu.
After the first time it is easy.	Bayan lokaci na farko yana da sauƙi.
But he took it.	Amma ya tafi da shi.
I do not want to go there.	Bana son zuwa can.
You do not have to eat much.	Ba sai ka ci da yawa ba.
Either way, it makes them very uncomfortable.	Ta wata hanya, yana sa su rashin jin daɗi sosai.
Do what you used to do.	Yi abin da kuka saba yi.
How it started, everything happened.	Yadda aka fara, duk abin da ya faru.
That's right.	Haka mu ke.
But no, not before.	Amma a'a, ba a da ba.
This is the correct correction.	Wannan shine gyara na daidai.
It just makes money.	Kudi kawai ke yi.
They know them all.	Sun san su duka.
In general, incorrect.	Gaba ɗaya, ba daidai ba.
Think for sure.	Tunani tabbas.
It will be interesting to see.	Zai zama mai ban sha'awa don gani.
Not this time.	Ba wannan lokacin ba.
She is very famous.	Tuna ta yi suna sosai.
But nothing now.	Amma ba komai yanzu.
He does not return anything to me.	Ba ya dawo mini da komai.
Nothing, they said.	Ba komai, suka ce.
Let's go back to where we are now.	Mu koma inda muke yanzu.
I learned a lot from reading it.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa daga karanta shi.
But it is good to be safe and patient.	Amma yana da kyau a zauna lafiya da hakuri.
If done right, no one will ever accuse you.	Idan an yi kyau, ba wanda zai taɓa zargin ku.
But the problem is there.	Amma matsalar tana nan.
I am not used to having one.	Ban saba masa da samun daya ba.
She was behind.	Ta kasance a baya.
I know you are.	Na san kai ne.
It looks like a mistake.	Ya yi kama da kuskure.
Therefore, they are useful.	Saboda haka, suna da amfani.
I have a job now.	Ina da aiki yanzu.
That ends here.	Wannan ya kare a nan.
No one knows.	Babu wanda ya sani.
They are good in it.	Suna da kyau a ciki.
Not if you are planning a life.	Ba idan kuna shirin rayuwa ba.
He wanted to change that.	Ya so ya canza hakan.
You will not be happy.	Ba za ku ji daɗi ba.
People started talking.	Mutane sun fara magana.
Maybe nothing happened.	Wataƙila babu wani abu da ya faru.
I am here now.	Ina nan yanzu.
His work continued to go there.	Aikin sa ya ci gaba da tafiya a can.
He knew they wanted to kill him here.	Ya san suna so su kashe shi a nan.
They seem to work and they are good.	Suna da alama suna aiki kuma suna da kyau.
From leaving the room.	Daga barin dakin.
We started on.	Mun fara a kan.
The fight is over.	An gama fada.
He is a real man.	Shi gaskiya ne, mutumin gaske.
Make a lot of fights.	Sanya fada da yawa.
I could not think of anything but him.	Na kasa tunanin komai sai shi.
Hurry up and should hurry up.	Yayi sauri kuma yakamata yayi sauri.
It had to be something, he told himself.	Dole ne ya zama wani abu, ya gaya wa kansa.
We just started calling him to go.	Mun fara ne aka kira shi ya tafi.
But she failed, she knew it.	Amma ta kasa, ta san haka.
By the way they live to go out into the world.	Ta yadda suke rayuwa su fita cikin duniya.
It's just true.	Gaskiya ne kawai.
I really like it.	Ina matukar son sa.
Maybe a little bigger here.	Wataƙila ya ɗan fi girma a nan.
She could not let that happen.	Ta kasa barin hakan ta faru.
So it was.	Don haka ya kasance.
But he got a job.	Amma ya samu aikin yi.
I was the one who made it happen.	Ni ne mutumin da ya sa hakan ta faru.
I am leaving in the morning.	Zan tafi da safe.
It was too much for him.	Abin ya yi masa yawa.
That's what she thought.	Tunanin ta kenan.
But she did not know why.	Amma ba ta san dalilin ba.
It will do us no good.	Ba zai yi mana komai ba.
She told him not to be afraid.	Ta ce masa kar ya ji tsoro.
Me too, man.	Ni kuma, mutum.
She doesn't have to say anything.	Ba sai ta ce komai ba.
I think a good year for him.	Ina tsammanin shekara mai kyau a gare shi.
He will do it for her.	Zai yi mata.
You can remove it safely.	Kuna iya cire shi lafiya.
It just took a lot of work.	Sai kawai ya ɗauki aiki mai yawa.
Can you give me some money?	Za a iya ba ni kuɗi?
Children take care.	Yara a kula.
As it is now.	Kamar yadda yake a yanzu.
Go with him.	Ku tafi tare da shi.
We met at a restaurant.	Mun hadu a wani gidan abinci.
You are so beautiful.	Kuna da kyau sosai.
We will leave it and leave it.	Za mu bar shi mu bar shi.
Everything is better.	Komai ya fi kyau.
You can not even remember that you are a woman.	Ba za ka iya ma tuna cewa kana da mata.
She did not leave him.	Ba ta bar shi ba.
He will definitely be there again.	Tabbas zai sake zama a wurin.
It took me almost three times more than usual.	Ya ɗauki ni kusan sau uku fiye da yadda aka saba.
It's not just a game, it's just a game.	Ba kawai yi ba, ba wasa kawai ba ne.
But in a way, he was right.	Amma a wata hanya, ya yi gaskiya.
He wants to get married this year.	Yana son yayi aure bana.
It's too cold.	Yayi sanyi sosai.
All you have to do is stay there.	Duk abin da za ku yi shi ne ku zauna a can.
She studied hard.	Ta yi karatu sosai.
I couldn’t find it in myself, not really.	Ba zan iya samun ta cikin kaina ba, ba da gaske ba.
And they do not sleep.	Kuma ba sa barci.
You or someone else is not leaving here.	Kai ko wani ba ka barin nan.
You will think of something.	Za ku yi tunanin wani abu.
They were very.	Sun kasance sosai.
It is still a lie.	Har yanzu karya ce.
I do not like you.	Ba na son ku.
I do not know if the person can read.	Ban sani ba ko mutumin zai iya karatu.
The next year they closed it.	A shekara ta gaba suka rufe shi.
It happened.	Haka ya faru.
Hope it will be well.	Da fatan za a yi kyau.
She immediately realized it was too big.	Nan take ta gane yana da girma sosai.
This is exactly one thing.	Wannan shi ne ainihin abu daya.
Sure, right away.	Tabbas, nan take.
You are one.	Kai daya ne.
It has a beautiful ending.	Yana da kyakkyawan ƙarshe.
I can really keep going.	Zan iya ci gaba da ci gaba da gaske.
It's too early for that.	Ya yi da wuri don wannan.
The water is coming out every night.	Ruwan ruwa yana fita kowane dare.
She didn't get it, so she didn't know what to say.	Ba ta samu ba, don haka ba ta san me za ta ce ba.
We are very happy.	Mun yi farin ciki sosai.
Hardly to answer.	Da wuya ya amsa.
The thought made her happy.	Tunanin yayi mata dadi.
Only one is coming.	Daya ne kawai ke zuwa.
However, do not bow your back.	Duk da haka, kar a baka bayan baya.
They just laughed at me.	Dariya kawai suka yi min.
He never failed me.	Bai taba kasa ni ba.
They forgot what they drank.	Sun manta abin da suka sha.
It can really help us.	Zai iya taimaka mana sosai.
Maybe they will try.	Wataƙila za su gwada.
Dinner lasts only about a month.	Abincin dare yana cikin lokacin kusan wata ɗaya kawai.
But everything was amazing.	Amma duk abin ya zama abin mamaki.
Not just mine, you see.	Ba nawa kawai ba, ka gani.
It's hard.	Yana da wuya.
Like it or not.	Kuna son shi ko kun ƙi shi.
Everyone knows now.	Kowa ya sani yanzu.
Good night.	Ta kwana.
Of course you look like one now.	Tabbas kuna kama da daya a yanzu.
He was right.	Ya yi gaskiya.
I have never traveled without it.	Ban taɓa yin tafiya ba tare da shi ba.
Time and place must be cut.	Dole ne a yanke lokaci da wurin.
Of course he should not come.	Tabbas bai kamata ya zo ba.
It's really, really great.	Yana da gaske, gaske mai girma.
But no one wants that.	Amma babu wanda yake son hakan.
He really didn't care about her.	A gaskiya bai damu da ita ba.
I need to leave you.	Ina bukata in bar ku.
To grow.	Don yin girma.
He studied hard in school.	Yayi karatu sosai a makaranta.
If money is needed, give it.	Idan ana buƙatar kuɗi, ba da shi.
This program will take you where you want to go.	Wannan shirin zai kai ku inda kuke son zuwa.
It cannot be missed.	Ba za a iya rasa shi ba.
If he wants to talk, he can start coming.	Idan yana son yin magana, zai iya fara zuwa.
This is a great inconvenience.	Wannan babban rashin jin daɗi ne.
Such is a bad idea.	Irin wannan mummunan tunani ne.
We can't get cold.	Ba za mu iya yin sanyi ba.
It's not about me.	Ba game da ni ba ne.
I heard them.	Na ji su.
I make you happy with it.	Ina yi muku farin ciki da shi.
I got up with him.	Na tashi tare da shi.
To understand what is going on.	Don gane me ke faruwa.
Or you are.	Ko kai ne.
This book is probably not for you.	Wataƙila wannan littafin ba na ku ba ne.
It's easy to do.	Yana da sauƙi a yi.
No one will help me.	Babu wanda zai taimake ni.
I want a dog too.	Ina son kare kuma.
I could not allow her to do that to me.	Ba zan iya yarda ta yi min haka ba.
That we like it.	Cewa muna son shi.
You have been doing a good job.	Kun kasance kuna yin aiki mai kyau.
It is from us.	Daga gare mu ke nan.
I often have trouble sleeping.	Sau da yawa ina samun matsalar barci.
I want him dead	Ina son ya mutu
The frequency of absenteeism has been alarming.	Yawan rashin zuwa aiki ya zama abin ban tsoro.
But they will find out what is going on.	Amma za su gano abin da ke faruwa.
I'm not very interested in things.	Ba ni da sha'awar abubuwa sosai.
The same is true of me.	Haka abin yake da ni.
He has been here for over a year.	Sama da shekara guda ya yi a nan.
I will not leave you.	Ba zan bar ku ba.
The road is about three times the same way.	Hanyar ta yi kamar sau uku tana tafiya haka.
The plane ran along with the train.	Jirgin ya yi gudu tare da jirgin.
Something has changed.	Wani abu ya canza.
But the story is not about that.	Amma labarin ba game da haka ba ne.
Probably not.	Wanda tabbas bai yi ba.
I'll give you this.	Zan baka wannan.
I was good at it.	Na yi kyau a ciki.
He filled it.	Ya cika shi.
I can use a little sleep.	Zan iya amfani da ɗan barci.
It's cold.	Yayi sanyi.
You are still you.	Kai har yanzu kai ne.
He then made some progress.	Daga nan ya samu ci gaba kadan.
However, it can come early.	Duk da haka, zai iya zuwa da wuri.
I have this.	Ina da wannan.
So, this is both.	Don haka, wannan duka biyu ne.
You just have to give up.	Kai kawai ka daina.
If the suspect appears, please arrest him.	Idan wanda ake zargin ya bayyana, don Allah a kama shi.
Happiness gripped her.	Farin ciki ya kama ta.
Sometimes by me.	Wani lokaci ta ni.
So are people.	Haka mutane suke.
Take someone you trust.	Ka ɗauki wani wanda ka yarda da kai.
I never did that.	Ban taba yin haka ba.
Less difficult than looking for you.	Kasa da wuya fiye da neman ku.
Big mistake, what did he really do to people.	Babban kuskure, me ya yi da gaske ga mutane.
This was for the best of me.	Wannan ya kasance don mafi kyau ni.
It must be stopped.	Dole ne a daina.
He has done it before.	Ya taba yi a baya.
To show you what is now.	Don nuna muku abin da ke yanzu.
Only time will tell.	Lokaci ne kawai zai nuna.
It is better for us.	Ya fiye mana.
I am indeed a happy child.	Lallai ni yaro ne mai farin ciki.
He did not wait long.	Bai dade ba ya jira.
Did you not agree with your article?	Ba ku yarda da labarin ku ba?
This trip has not been.	Wannan tafiya ba ta kasance ba.
Actually this man is really married.	Gaskiya wannan mutumin da gaske yayi aure.
Everything is written.	Duk abin da aka rubuta.
They've done well so far.	Sun yi kyau ya zuwa yanzu.
Okay, though.	Yayi kyau, ko da.
He never did.	Ba ya taba yi.
I will be close.	Zan kasance kusa.
Who maybe said something good about us.	Wanda watakila ya ce wani abu mai kyau game da mu.
Is there a proper way.	Shin akwai hanyar da ta dace.
You play to win the game.	Kuna wasa don cin nasara wasan.
True, but it's also fun to play around.	Gaskiya, amma yana da daɗi yin wasa a kusa.
Go ahead, try it now.	Ci gaba, gwada shi a yanzu.
Work on beauty.	Aiki akan kyau.
One of the first.	Daya daga cikin na farko.
He wants to touch her.	Yana son ya taba ta.
This is the one we came out with.	Wannan shi ne wanda muka fito.
She failed me.	Ta kasa ni.
On a busy night.	A cikin dare mai yawan aiki.
We want to play our best.	Muna son yin wasa mafi kyau.
I will take care of myself.	Zan kula da kaina.
The second was the same.	Haka na biyu ya kasance.
I think we have.	Ina tsammanin muna da.
But the lack of response is not good.	Amma rashin amsa ba dadi.
Call the police.	Kira 'yan sanda.
The film is amazing in this film.	Fim ɗin yana da ban mamaki a cikin wannan fim.
Do not get up from inside.	Kar ku tashi daga ciki.
He still has a home there.	Har yanzu yana da gida a can.
And it makes me amazing.	Kuma yana sa ni ban mamaki.
So it is very interesting.	Don haka yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
I do not know if I will feel sad or happy.	Ban san ko zan ji bakin ciki ko farin ciki ba.
He waited at the bus stop.	Ya jira a tashar bas.
And now look around on your head.	Kuma yanzu duba a kusa da kan ku.
It looks like only one.	Kama daya ne kawai.
So, get ready.	Don haka, a shirya.
And you should pay attention too.	Kuma ya kamata ku kula kuma.
Nothing, boy.	Ba komai, yaro.
They were like us.	Sun kasance kamar mu.
Just sit.	Zama kawai.
Others died, many were injured.	Wasu kuma sun mutu, da yawa sun ji rauni.
No, not really.	A'a, ba sosai ba.
The book is interesting.	Littafin yana da ban sha'awa.
Therefore, their identity must be verified.	Don haka, dole ne a tabbatar da ainihin su.
He looked familiar.	Ya duba saba.
Whenever he got a chance he took it.	Duk lokacin da ya samu dama sai ya dauka.
Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.	Wani lokaci yana aiki, wani lokacin kuma ba ya aiki.
He left her behind.	Ya bar ta a baya.
You must pass immediately and tell us everything.	Dole ne ku wuce nan da nan kuma ku gaya mana komai.
I try hard and it doesn’t work.	Ina ƙoƙari da ƙoƙari kuma ba ya aiki.
Your name.	Sunan ku.
I feel this passion too.	Ina jin wannan sha'awar kuma.
Where do you want to go?	Ina kuke son zuwa?
You will not cry.	Ba za ku yi kuka ba.
A little.	Kadan.
So we confirm the first statement.	Don haka mun tabbatar da magana ta farko.
We want you to know that we have suffered.	Mun so ka san cewa mun sha wahala.
It never worked.	Ba a taɓa yin aiki ba.
And they will continue.	Kuma za su ci gaba.
Sometimes more often than at home during the week.	Wani lokaci sau da yawa fiye da na gida a cikin mako.
They will not give up.	Ba za su daina ba.
He sat for a long time thinking of last night.	Ya dade a zaune yana tunanin daren jiya.
Little time we were together, we were happy.	Kadan lokacin da muke tare, muna farin ciki.
It is not so.	Ba haka yake ba.
One wonders why he has never done another.	Wani yana mamakin me yasa bai taba yin wani ba.
He spent the night looking for work.	Ya kwana yana neman aiki.
Maybe they didn’t.	Wataƙila ba su yi ba.
He wanted to go really well.	Ya so ya tafi sosai.
And it can be found.	Kuma ana iya samun.
She felt very comfortable.	Ta ji dadi sosai.
As we can say, this is not true.	Kamar yadda za mu iya faɗa, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
We have to do it again.	Dole ne mu sake yin hakan.
We do not accept this conclusion.	Ba mu yarda da wannan ƙarshe ba.
There is much more to go.	Akwai sauran da yawa da za a je.
Content available.	Abubuwan da ke akwai.
Exactly as described.	Daidai kamar yadda aka bayyana.
She is interested in him.	Tana sha'awar zuwa gare shi.
I'm sure it is.	Na tabbata haka ne.
They are up together.	Suna sama tare.
I really like this.	Ina son wannan sosai.
Now be with you.	Yanzu ku kasance tare da ku.
It’s not what you see you see.	Ba abin da kuke gani kuke gani ba.
Please be remembered to eat.	Da fatan za a tuna ku ci.
It was for me.	Ya kasance a gare ni.
Maybe tomorrow.	Wataƙila gobe ne.
People can be killed.	Ana iya kashe mutane.
This works really well.	Wannan yana aiki sosai.
And that's fine.	Kuma hakan yayi kyau.
So this is one thing.	Don haka wannan abu ɗaya ne.
Time to leave when this happens.	Lokacin barin lokacin da wannan ya faru.
I didn't tell anyone.	Ban gaya wa kowa ba.
I'm sure you can.	Na tabbata za ku iya.
She flew up into the air.	Ta tashi sama sama.
I'm sure you do too.	Na tabbata ku ma kuna yi.
Somehow nothing.	Ko ta yaya ba komai.
The flight is late.	Jirgin ya makara.
And food will be brought to you.	Kuma a kawo muku abinci.
The man lives in a strange house.	Mutumin yana zaune ne a cikin wani gida mai ban sha'awa.
But he got up.	Amma ya tashi.
Close the door.	Rufe kofar.
They are happy and that is true.	Suna jin daɗi kuma hakan gaskiya ne.
Anyone interested.	Duk mai sha'awar.
It is good here.	Yana da kyau a nan.
I wonder if he agrees?	Ina mamakin ko ya yarda?
They are very long.	Sun dade sosai.
Some children prefer to play outside.	Wasu yara sun fi son yin wasa a waje.
Or maybe even more.	Ko watakila ya fi haka.
Everything outside is beyond him.	Komai a waje ya wuce shi.
But until they do, we don’t know.	Amma har sai sun yi, ba mu sani ba.
I have players	Ina da 'yan wasa
Call the police.	Kira 'yan sanda.
You do not know for sure.	Ba ku san hakan ba tabbas.
Now he needs money.	Yanzu yana bukatar kudi.
It always looks really good.	Koyaushe yana kama da gaske.
Not very helpful.	Ba taimako sosai.
Why, she does not know.	Me ya sa, ba ta sani ba.
I have to get into the dress.	Dole ne in shiga cikin riga.
So it was very useful.	Don haka ya kasance mai amfani haka.
The time is near.	Lokaci ya kusa.
They don’t necessarily have reached more.	Ba lallai ba ne sun kai fiye.
I have a little bit of everything.	Ina da kadan daga komai.
Do not die.	Kada ku mutu.
She tried too.	Ita ma ta gwada.
They seem useful.	Suna kama da amfani.
She is running.	Gudu take yi.
We arrived at the train station.	Mun zo tashar jirgin kasa.
From work.	Daga wurin aiki.
He was amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
It is better to go.	Gara a tafi.
Of course he has his own thoughts.	Tabbas yana da tunanin kansa.
Even if you can.	Ko da za ku iya.
Of course I will read before then.	Tabbas zan karanta kafin nan.
I will never be able to understand how you did it.	Ba zan taɓa iya gane yadda kuka yi ba.
No matter how unpleasant it may be.	Komai rashin jin daɗi hakan na iya zama.
Let if.	Bari idan.
Somehow it was better tonight.	Ko ta yaya ya fi kyau a daren yau.
You get everything.	Kuna samun komai.
This was nothing new at the time.	Wannan ba sabon abu ba ne a lokacin.
Try something new!	Gwada sabon abu!
Make a seat, please.	Yi wurin zama, don Allah.
Make sure nothing is touched.	Tabbatar ba a taɓa komai ba.
Had it happened, we would have loved it.	Da ya faru, da mun so shi.
I'm interested.	Ina sha'awar.
You may or may not agree with this.	Kuna iya ko ba za ku yarda da wannan ba.
She knew what was there.	Ta san abin da ke wurin.
I was sold.	An sayar da ni.
It can be very difficult.	Zai iya zama da wahala sosai.
No one wanted to hear.	Ba wanda ya so ya ji.
They did not even explain why.	Ba su ma bayyana dalilin yin haka ba.
It can be off.	Zai iya zama a kashe.
But he failed.	Amma ya kasa.
I can't talk to him.	Ba zan iya magana da shi ba.
You have to make people feel these things, however it is necessary.	Dole ne ku sa mutane su ji waɗannan abubuwa, duk da haka ya zama dole.
It doesn't seem to fix it.	Da alama baya gyara shi.
Best book for the moment.	Mafi kyawun littafin don lokacin.
They could not find her.	Sun kasa gano ta.
I think he must help us.	Ina ganin dole ne ya taimaka mana.
It is time to have lunch.	Lokaci ya yi da za a ci abincin rana.
They are very large, they are very beautiful.	Suna da girma da yawa, suna da kyau sosai.
It's me? 	Ni ne?
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
When we get up.	Lokacin mu tashi.
But that is not all.	Amma ba wannan kadai ba.
I can’t do that, though.	Ba zan iya yin hakan ba, ko da yake.
He is not a man.	Shi ba mutum ba ne.
I will not tell anyone who you are.	Ba zan gaya wa kowa kai wanene ba.
The flight is on time.	Jirgin yana kan lokaci.
It could be.	Zata iya zama .
I can't imagine who he was.	Ba zan iya tunanin wanene shi ba.
I will be back next year.	Zan dawo shekara mai zuwa.
The last one we wanted.	Na karshen mun so.
And that went.	Kuma hakan ya tafi.
No time now.	Babu lokaci yanzu.
The problem with this car is that it does not fly.	Matsalar wannan motar ita ce ba ta tashi.
This growth is due to two factors.	Wannan girma ya faru ne saboda abubuwa biyu.
We never found a way, but she did.	Ba mu taɓa samun wata hanya ba, amma ta samu.
If they catch you, they will kill you.	Idan sun kama ka, za su kashe ka.
You've got a setback.	Kun sami koma baya.
This is going to be an exciting game.	Wannan zai zama wasa mai ban sha'awa.
I'm just sad.	Ina bakin ciki kawai.
And there is no time like now.	Kuma babu lokaci kamar yanzu.
That's how everyone feels at first.	Haka kowa yake ji da farko.
And there just sits.	Kuma a can kawai zaune.
He stopped.	Har ya tsaya.
What to do.	Me za ka yi.
You made a mistake about it.	Kun yi kuskure game da shi.
That's why he ran.	Shi ya sa ya gudu.
This is what will happen to us.	Wannan shi ne abin da zai faru da mu.
Great dog.	Babban kare.
By the way they do it right.	Ta hanyar da suka yi daidai.
He got up.	Tashi ya tashi.
I have to show it.	Dole ne in nuna shi.
Maybe before she married me, but not since.	Watakila kafin ta aure ni, amma ba tun lokacin ba.
But it is not true, nor is it.	Amma ba gaskiya ba ne, ba kuma.
Something still hasn't added.	Wani abu har yanzu bai ƙara ba.
You can kill yourself to say that.	Kuna iya kashe kanku don yin magana haka.
We have no place to go.	Ba mu da wurin zuwa.
Let's just remember.	Mu tuna kawai.
For one thing only.	Don abu ɗaya kawai.
I never got it.	Ban taba samun shi ba.
Maybe he even understood.	Watakila ma ya gane.
How old are you?	Tsawon ku nawa?
Only one.	Guda kawai.
No, do not repeat.	A'a, kar a sake.
She said the man had never been seen again.	Ta ce ba a sake ganin wannan mutumin ba.
The new coffee is good.	Sabon kofi akan yayi kyau.
You just need to say everything about it.	Kuna buƙatar cewa komai game da shi kawai.
One you have never seen.	Wanda baka taba gani ba.
This works.	Wannan yana aiki.
We will never allow this to happen again.	Ba za mu taɓa barin wannan ya sake faruwa ba.
I could not do that.	Na kasa yin hakan.
He will go.	Zai tafi.
We want you back.	Muna son ku dawo.
But why my nationality did not work.	Amma me yasa na kasa bai yi aiki ba.
That did for her.	Hakan yayi mata.
I missed my opportunity.	Na rasa dama ta.
If only he could see.	Idan ya gani kawai.
You never wanted anything.	Ba ku taɓa son wani abu ba.
No one wants to do that.	Babu wanda ya so yin hakan.
The man looked up.	Mutumin ya duba.
Only one person did this.	Mutum daya ne ya yi wannan.
The story goes on and on.	Labarin ya ci gaba da tafiya.
But it was never fun for me.	Amma ba ta taɓa jin daɗi a gare ni ba.
Let's go.	Mu shiga.
This is the same thing about money.	Abu daya kenan game da kudi.
I know many others who have done it.	Na san da yawa wasu da suka yi shi.
That's the game.	Wasan kenan.
I have done them several times in the past.	Na taba yin su sau da yawa a baya.
We do not need to talk.	Ba mu buƙatar magana.
He should do so altogether.	Ya kamata ya yi haka gaba ɗaya.
But now we know how it worked.	Amma yanzu mun san yadda ya yi aiki.
I had to.	Dole na yi.
But this is not the answer.	Amma wannan ba amsa.
Everyone needs help.	Kowa na bukatar taimako.
Not really, she said.	Ba da gaske ba, in ji ta.
She falls into the book.	Ta fad'a cikin littafin.
I hope they learned a thing or two from watching us.	Ina fatan sun koyi abu daya ko biyu daga kallon mu.
He knows what he is doing.	Ya san abin da yake yi.
It's more than ever.	Ya fi a da.
You must change.	Dole ne ku canza.
She also has nothing.	Ita kuma ba ta da komai.
I have to be something else.	Dole ne in zama wani abu kuma.
Do not rush.	Kada ku yi sauri da sauri.
He feels fine.	Ya ji lafiya.
Or maybe they were.	Ko watakila sun kasance.
Give them something good to eat.	Ka ba su wani abu mai kyau su ci.
There, now you know.	Can, yanzu kun sani.
One's job is to feel it.	Aikin mutum shine ya ji kansa.
It's about the same.	Yana da game da guda.
You can do many things.	Kuna iya yin abubuwa da yawa.
I will be back with the police.	Zan dawo tare da 'yan sanda.
But don't tell me.	Amma kar ka gaya mani.
I told him that at the time.	Na gaya masa haka a lokacin.
None.	Babu ko ɗaya.
I wonder what they ate for dinner.	Ina mamakin abin da suka ci abincin dare.
Some people have a problem.	Wasu mutane suna da matsala.
Help me people.	Ku taimake ni mutane.
The train left the ground on time.	Jirgin ya bar kasa a kan lokaci.
Not much.	Babu yawa.
He was interested in almost everything.	Ya kasance yana sha'awar kusan komai.
I won't even answer him.	Ba zan ma amsa masa ba.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba wannan ba.
There is no doubt about it.	Babu shakka babu shakka game da shi.
We learned that the hard way.	Mun koyi cewa da wuya hanya.
After a while he realized who he was.	Bayan wani lokaci ya gane ko wanene.
But don't talk.	Amma kada yayi magana.
Kind of like.	Irin kama.
Stupid, perhaps, but in a good way.	Rashin hankali, watakila, amma a hanya mai kyau.
I tried to bring a little something to everyone.	Na yi ƙoƙarin kawo ɗan wani abu ga kowa da kowa.
I told him to get out of the car.	Na ce masa ya fito daga cikin motar.
You will be happy, no problem.	Za ku ji daɗi, ba matsala.
However, it is not new.	Duk da haka, ba sabon abu ba ne.
Let it be.	Bar ta zama.
The problem is that she is often ill.	Matsalar ita ce tana yawan rashin lafiya.
With another.	Da wani.
There were two others.	An sami wasu biyu.
I would like them made of metal.	Ina so a sanya su cikin karfe.
They had to answer for someone else.	Sai da suka amsa wa wani.
I have to play with it.	Dole ne in yi wasa da shi.
Had he been honest and sincere with him in the past.	Da ya kasance mai gaskiya da gaskiya tare da shi a baya.
It is what we lost.	Shi ne abin da muka rasa.
She said she didn't.	Ta ce ba ta yi ba.
They are very familiar with each other.	Sun saba da juna sosai.
No one said anything good.	Babu wanda ya ce komai mai kyau.
Yes, we know it.	Haka ne, mun san shi.
Using it will be even more difficult.	Amfani da shi zai zama ma fi wahala.
No need to know.	Ba buƙatar sani ba.
You are a great person.	Kai babban mutum ne.
And keep going.	Kuma ku ci gaba.
That would do.	Da zai yi.
Run some more.	Gudu wasu ƙarin.
I have come to speak to you.	Na zo nan don yin magana da ku.
Kind of feeling speechless.	Irin jin rashin magana.
Keep it up and don’t stop.	Ci gaba da shi kuma kada ku tsaya.
She knew it would not be.	Ta san ba zai kasance ba.
And there are good ones.	Kuma akwai masu kyau.
It just didn’t feel right to me.	Kawai bai ji min daidai ba.
Now everything is working as it should.	Yanzu komai yana aiki kamar yadda ya kamata.
You can do it again.	Kuna iya sake yin hakan.
We hit.	Mun buga.
I am just as happy as we are.	Ina matukar farin ciki kamar yadda muke.
This is just one.	Wannan daya ne kawai.
I love the amazing things in this book.	Ina son abubuwan ban mamaki masu ban mamaki a cikin wannan littafin.
Let's confirm the second.	Mu tabbatar da na biyu.
Absolutely, of course.	Ba shakka, ba shakka.
The car became very hot and stopped.	Motar ta yi zafi sosai kuma ta tsaya.
I wish if you could hit some here.	Ina so idan za ku iya buga wasu a nan.
He is bigger than me.	Ya fi ni girma.
Who walks alone?	Wanene ke tafiya shi kaɗai?
Even more than that.	Ko da yawa fiye da haka.
He should not be here.	Bai kamata ya kasance a nan ba.
I don’t think about it.	Ba na tunani game da shi.
It should do.	Ya kamata ya yi.
But that is ridiculous.	Amma hakan abin dariya ne.
And there seems to be more interest this year.	Kuma da alama akwai ƙarin sha'awa a wannan shekara.
I am not interested in any of this.	Ba ni da sha'awar ko ɗaya daga cikin wannan.
I got pregnant almost after we got married.	Na samu ciki kusan bayan mun yi aure.
It's easy.	Yana da sauƙi.
Stand in the room.	Tsaya a dakin.
Disconnect from use.	Saka daga amfani.
I don't need it.	Bana bukata.
I went in and sat down.	Na shiga na zauna.
She does too.	Ita ma tana yi.
No one will help me.	Babu wanda zai taimake ni.
He went back.	Ya koma baya.
Here is what happened.	A nan ne abin ya faru.
They will be better than nothing.	Za su fi komai kyau.
Sometimes we have similar thoughts.	Wani lokaci muna da irin wannan tunanin.
The events make one wonder, is it really?	Abubuwan da suka faru sun sa mutum ya yi mamaki, shin da gaske ne?
He went with the rest.	Ya tafi da sauran.
But then, they realized.	Amma sai, sun gane.
He never left today.	Bata taba fita yau ba.
I came close to her.	Na zo kusa da ita.
I completely forgot about work.	Na manta da aiki gaba daya.
He told me that often.	Ya gaya mani cewa sau da yawa.
How it is used.	Yadda aka yi amfani da shi.
There is something here.	Akwai wani abu a nan.
The same goes for lunch.	Haka da abincin rana.
There really is no better than it.	Akwai gaske ba fiye da shi.
Now the real excitement has begun.	Yanzu jin daɗin gaske ya fara.
That is not a problem.	Hakan ba matsala.
She has always been.	Ta kasance koyaushe.
Or it seemed like it to me, at the time.	Ko kuma ya zama kamar a gare ni, a wannan lokacin.
I never got involved.	Ban taba shiga ciki ba.
Or they may not be.	Ko kuma kada su kasance.
There is, first, the person himself.	Akwai, da farko, mutumin da kansa.
This is for me, the end.	Wannan shi ne a gare ni, karshen.
They left everything and fled.	Suka bar komai suka gudu.
Know what our financial situation is.	Ku san abin da muke ciki na kudi.
I understand how you feel.	Na fahimci yadda kuke ji.
I just want to help you.	Ina so in taimake ku kawai.
She decided she would stop.	Ta yanke shawarar za ta daina.
And you are cold.	Kuma kun yi sanyi.
You see, it works.	Za ku gani, yana aiki.
I want it to be real.	Ina so ya zama na gaske.
Remember that you are human.	Ka tuna cewa kai mutum ne.
He was famous, of course.	Ya kasance suna, ba shakka.
In fact, it is very good.	A gaskiya, yana da kyau sosai.
Come now, come now.	Zo yanzu, zo yanzu.
She knew she had to change.	Ta san dole ta canza.
For a while he never left.	Na dan lokaci ya taba ya tafi.
People are dead.	Mutane sun mutu.
I knew then, if not someone else.	Na san a lokacin, in ba wane ba.
If you are tired, sleep.	Idan kun gaji, yi barci.
I hope you know that somehow.	Ina fatan kun san hakan ko ta yaya.
They have lunch.	Suna cin abincin rana.
But you are right.	Amma kun yi daidai.
Up here too.	Sama nan ma.
The house is down.	Gidan yayi kasa.
Take your time too.	Ɗauki lokacin ku kuma.
However, he gave it to us all.	Duk da haka, ya ba mu duka.
He wanted to stay there.	Ya so ya zauna a can.
Or so they thought.	Ko haka suka yi tunani.
And do not lie to me.	Kuma kada ku yi min karya.
Of course they understood.	Tabbas sun gane.
I know very little about such things.	Na san kadan game da irin waɗannan abubuwa.
And it scares me to the point of death, really.	Kuma yana bani tsoro har na mutu, gaskiya.
The next one did the same.	Haka ma na gaba ya yi.
And, in fact, they will continue to do so.	Kuma, a gaskiya, za su ci gaba da yin ta.
This weekend has been very exciting.	Wannan karshen mako ya kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
She did well with it.	Ta yi kyau da shi.
We see them almost every day.	Muna ganin su kusan kowace rana.
He is tired of that.	Ya gaji haka.
I wonder about that.	Ina mamakin hakan .
We continued walking.	Muka ci gaba da tafiya.
Or someone else.	Ko kuma wani.
This is not about me.	Wannan ba game da ni ba ne.
Or something will go wrong.	Ko kuma wani abu zai yi kuskure.
However, they probably won't.	Duk da haka, da alama ba za su yi ba.
I felt very depressed.	Na ji rashin hankali sosai.
There are good things there.	Akwai abubuwa masu kyau a wurin.
It happens to many women.	Yana faruwa da mata da yawa.
The second he heard.	Na biyu ya ji.
It was not immediately clear what she would say.	Har yanzu ba a bayyana ainihin abin da za ta ce ba.
We have not seen anyone use this method.	Ba mu ga kowa yana amfani da wannan hanyar ba.
I want something else.	Ina son wani abu kuma.
Do it or not.	Kuna yi ko ba ku yi ba.
I wish.	Ina fata.
Hopefully you will be back to school work.	Da fatan za ku dawo da aikin makaranta.
You are not the same person.	Kai kuma ba mutum daya bane.
It gave me great ease.	Ya ba ni sauƙi mai girma.
Life goes on for these people.	Rayuwa tana ci gaba ga waɗannan mutane.
I wondered why it was so late.	Na yi mamakin dalilin da yasa ta makara.
But in the end, nothing changed.	Amma a ƙarshe, babu abin da ya canza.
I began to see him clearly.	Na fara ganin shi da kyau.
No one heard them.	Ba wanda ya ji su.
This will hurt.	Wannan zai yi zafi.
The car door is open.	Kofar motar a bude take.
She was where she was.	Ta kasance inda take.
But don’t tell me what you can do.	Amma kar ka gaya mani abin da za ka iya yi.
If so, we are done for.	Idan haka ne, mun gama don.
We are nearing the end.	Muna kusa da ƙarshe.
Eat slowly.	Ku ci a hankali.
Nor would he ever know.	Haka kuma ba zai taba sani ba.
Fish have not yet been sold.	Har yanzu ba a sayar da kifi ba.
It was cold and something.	Ya yi sanyi da wani abu.
I was scared of him.	Na ji tsoro gare shi.
It will take some time for.	Zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci don.
Which they did.	Wanda sai suka yi.
I did not do well in this.	Ban yi kyau a wannan ba.
I'd like to be needed.	Ina son ana bukata.
Some of these things later became a reality.	Wasu daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan daga baya sun zama gaskiya.
However, there are some things that are good.	Duk da haka, akwai wasu abubuwa da suke da kyau.
Let me tell you something about myself.	Bari in gaya muku wani abu game da kaina.
He decided to go out.	Ya yanke shawarar fita.
Did they meet there? 	Sun hadu a can?
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
I don't care.	Ban damu haka ba.
She didn't necessarily have a problem.	Ba lallai ne ta sami matsala ba.
And she failed to lie.	Kuma ta kasa yin karya.
When no one came, he continued.	Lokacin da babu wanda ya zo, ya ci gaba.
We'll find out tomorrow.	Za mu gano wani abu gobe.
Everyone already knows you should.	Kowa ya riga ya san ya kamata ku yi.
I can take it home now.	Zan iya kai shi gida a yanzu.
It would be better to go and check.	Zai fi kyau mu je mu duba.
It has always been the best job !.	Ya kasance mafi kyawun aiki koyaushe!.
The first one to get there was successful.	Wanda ya fara zuwa can ya yi nasara.
I should have slept.	Ya kamata na yi barci.
Maybe it's because we're late and we're tired.	Wataƙila saboda an makara ne kuma mun gaji.
They look like they would be happy to use.	Suna kama da za su yi farin ciki don amfani.
For a week.	Na tsawon mako guda.
Hope you see.	Da fatan, kun gani.
Either way the truth will seem like it doesn’t matter much.	Ko ta yaya gaskiya zata yi kamar ba ta da yawa.
It's a good night out.	Yana da kyau dare fita.
But no one asked her.	Amma babu wanda ya tambaye ta.
Some must be done.	Dole ne a yi wasu.
I'm sorry.	Na yi hakuri.
It will not show.	Ba zai nuna ba.
They have to make the most difficult decisions, perhaps.	Dole ne su yanke shawarar da suka fi wuya, watakila.
Just wait outside for a while.	Jira kawai a waje na ɗan lokaci.
It is good that she is staying with us.	Yana da kyau ta zauna tare da mu.
She is not here.	Ba ta nan.
It would have been done.	Da an yi shi.
You should see it here.	Ya kamata ku gani a nan.
So it was difficult for him.	Don haka hakan ya yi masa wuya.
He should be back.	Yakamata ya dawo.
You are better than that.	Kun fi wannan.
She was also the first to be told.	Ita ma ta kasance lokacin da aka fara gaya mata.
He was interested.	Ya kasance yana sha'awa.
Not so.	Ba haka ba.
Do what you want.	Yi abin da kuke so.
It is true for me.	Gaskiya ne a gare ni.
If she has anything to say, she says.	Idan tana da abin da za ta ce, ta ce.
This is something.	Wannan wani abu ne.
No one can touch it.	Babu wanda zai iya taba shi.
But you can not.	Amma ba za ku iya ba.
They sat down to eat.	Zauna suka ci abinci.
He came out.	Ya fito.
And you'll let him in, or not.	Kuma za ku bar shi ya shiga, ko a'a.
I can love you.	Zan iya son ku.
Things have changed since we came here.	Abubuwa sun canza tun lokacin da muka zo nan.
The children kept running.	Yara sun yi ta gudu da sauri.
This way.	Ga hanya.
Just waiting.	Kamar an jira.
Mental problems are the problems of life.	Matsalar hankali ita ce ta matsalar rayuwa.
Indeed, sometimes there is no success.	Lallai, wani lokacin ba a samun nasara.
But they are in the future.	Amma suna nan gaba.
Everything is moving fast.	Komai yana tafiya da sauri.
Make sure children are cared for at all times	Tabbatar cewa ana kula da yara a kowane lokaci
He had to look ahead.	Sai da ya kalli gaba.
So do I.	Haka da ni.
I have been here for a month.	Ina nan tsawon wata guda.
They do not think and reason as they did in the past.	Ba sa tunani da tunani kamar yadda suka yi a baya.
Just time.	Lokaci kawai.
I look down.	Ina kallon kasa.
The third thing is really human.	Abu na uku da gaske mutum ne .
Two years ago.	Shekaru biyu da suka gabata.
Some have toilets but others do not.	Wasu suna da bayan gida amma wasu ba su da.
Where he knows she.	Inda ya san tana.
Yet few can get it right.	Duk da haka 'yan kaɗan ne za su iya samun daidai.
No it is not.	A'a ba shi ba.
We are very weak.	Mun yi rauni sosai.
He used to feel right and wrong.	Ya kasance yana jin daidai da kuskure.
It works for everyone.	Yana aiki ga kowa da kowa.
I arrived home	na isa gida
I hope they work on whatever it is.	Ina fata suna aiki akan duk abin da yake.
You told me.	Kun so ni.
Although they seem to be working well here as usual.	Duk da alama suna aiki da kyau a nan kamar yadda aka saba.
Things like this take time.	Abubuwa irin wannan suna ɗaukar lokaci.
I don't remember it.	Ban tuna shi ba.
For this we work as follows.	Don wannan muna aiki kamar haka.
I always think about it.	Ina tunani game da ita koyaushe.
There are opportunities.	Akwai dama.
People were afraid to go to the moon.	Mutane sun kasance suna tsoron tafiya zuwa wata.
What people are saying.	Abin da mutane ke cewa.
But we need to do that.	Amma muna bukatar yin wannan.
They have changed little by little.	Sun canza kadan kadan.
And she was.	Kuma ta kasance.
We can do this at any time.	Za mu iya yin hakan a kowane lokaci.
He seemed to suffer.	Ya yi kama da ya sha wuya.
Feeling is the thing.	Ji shine abu.
It will not happen.	Ba zai faru ba.
She stared at the sky for a long time.	Ta dade tana kallon sama.
They have to answer this problem.	Dole ne su amsa wannan matsalar.
Life is a journey.	Rayuwa tafiya ce.
They will not be left there.	Ba za a bar su a can ba.
If anything, it will add to it.	Idan wani abu, zai ƙara shi.
It has never been sold.	Ba a taba sayar da shi ba.
Let's meet next time !.	Mu hadu a gaba!.
However you did not.	Duk da haka ba ku yi ba.
Otherwise, the room is empty.	In ba haka ba, dakin babu kowa.
I will ask him next.	Zan tambaye shi a gaba.
Now, we do.	Yanzu, muna yi.
Everything that happens is something else.	Duk abin da ke faruwa wani abu ne kuma.
They can't play.	Ba za su iya wasa ba.
It was done.	An yi haka.
Not all of them have.	Ba duka suke da su ba.
I will surprise you very much.	Zan ba ku mamaki sosai.
I can not.	Ba zan iya ba.
I feel good he is not me.	Na ji dadi yana yi ba ni ba.
The room is entered.	Dakin ya shiga.
Let's hope this program does not fail.	Bari mu yi fatan wannan shirin ba zai yi nasara ba.
I never thought of that.	Na taba tunanin mu haka.
And we know she’s out there with me.	Kuma mun san cewa ta yi waje da ni.
They should look really good.	Ya kamata su yi kyau da gaske.
There are a few that appear each year.	Akwai 'yan kaɗan da suka bayyana kowace shekara.
I myself am fine.	Ni kaina ina lafiya.
We suffered a lot.	Mun sha wahala da yawa.
We are not prepared for that.	Ba mu shirya don haka ba.
We can not be late.	Ba za mu iya makara ba.
She always laughs at me.	Kullum tana bani dariya.
But the task is very difficult.	Amma abin aikin yana da wahala sosai.
You run, and that's it.	Kuna gudu, kuma shi ke nan.
I do not know why you say no.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa kuke cewa ba haka ba.
We get all this.	Muna samun duk wannan.
I should not use it.	Bai kamata in yi amfani da shi ba.
Get on the boat.	Fito a kan jirgin ruwa.
If you return home, now.	Idan kun koma gida, yanzu.
This is never in doubt.	Wannan bai taba cikin shakka ba.
Probably not.	Wataƙila ba ya kasance.
That's what it is about.	Abin da ke game da shi ke nan.
Below.	A kasa.
He went to work.	Ya tafi aiki.
He just used it.	Ya yi amfani da shi kawai.
We are one.	Mu daya ne.
I know you better.	Na fi ku sani.
The man used to surprise her.	Mutumin ya kasance yana ba ta mamaki.
I still do not understand what happened.	Har yanzu ban gane abin da ya faru ba.
He was very honest about it.	Ya kasance mai gaskiya da gaske game da hakan.
However, it is amazing.	Duk da haka, yana da ban mamaki.
He wants to make her cry again.	So yake ya sake mata kuka.
I want him to be happy.	Ina so ya yi farin ciki.
You never know when it will happen.	Ba ku taɓa sanin lokacin da za su faru ba.
He held it gently like something weak.	Ya ajiye shi a hankali kamar wani abu mai rauni.
Or he took what he used.	Ko kuma ya dauki abin da ya yi amfani da shi.
He is not a man.	Ba mutum ba ne.
He never played this game himself.	Bai taba yin wannan wasan da kansa ba.
I'm sure it is.	Na tabbata shi ne.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
You have to think a lot.	Dole ne ku yi tunani da yawa.
He thought he was ready.	Ya dauka ya shirya.
Any method can be used.	Ana iya amfani da kowace hanya.
And you heard it.	Kuma kun ji shi.
Some do not.	Wasu ba sa yi.
I don't usually do that.	Ba na yawan yin haka.
Let's start with one you can answer.	Bari mu fara da daya za ku iya ba da amsa.
I hope they will help you too.	Ina fatan su ma za su taimake ku.
She used to think everything was wrong.	Ta kasance tana tunanin komai ba daidai ba.
But nothing has ever been easier.	Amma babu abin da ya taɓa zama mai sauƙi.
We waited and waited, but no one came.	Mun jira mun jira, amma ba wanda ya zo.
He himself did not have much.	Shi kansa ba shi da yawa.
There is so much to do.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a yi.
We are back home from the game.	Mun dawo gida daga wasan.
Children do not like swimming.	Yara ba sa son iyo.
Just wanted to know that she knew.	So kawai ya sani cewa ta sani.
It made me want to live again.	Ta sa ni so in sake rayuwa.
In fact, not everyone.	A gaskiya, ba kowa ba.
Make sure it is hot.	A tabbata mai yayi zafi.
Never spoken.	Ba a taba yin magana ba.
Remember how he felt.	Ka tuna yadda ya ji.
Everyone has their first boat.	Kowa yana da jirgin ruwa na farko.
You must go where people are.	Lallai dole ne ku je inda mutane suke.
He hates it, and he does not want them to do it.	Ya ƙi shi, kuma ba ya son su yi.
We must look up.	Dole ne mu kalli sama.
Tomorrow is another day for me.	Gobe ​​wata rana ce a gare ni.
Twice, he failed.	Sau biyu, ya kasa.
That is why you will not return.	Shi ya sa ba za ku koma ba.
What he sees is not true.	Abin da yake gani ba gaskiya ba ne.
The player ran very fast.	Dan wasan ya yi gudu da sauri da sauri.
She wanted to touch him.	Ta so ta taba shi.
The rest of the time, you won’t even know he’s there.	Sauran lokacin, ba za ku ma san yana can ba.
We need a way to fix this.	Muna bukatar hanyar gyara wannan.
Everything he ever did was fine.	Duk abin da ya taba ya yi kyau.
But, this is not much of it.	Amma, wannan ba shi da yawa daga ciki.
Fear makes interest.	Tsoro yana sa sha'awa.
They are all grown now.	Duk sun girma yanzu.
She didn't want to wear it.	Ba ta so ta saka.
I don't want to be paid for my unemployment.	Ba na son a biya ni rashin aiki.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
They went beyond that.	Sun wuce haka.
It's not easy.	Ba shi da sauƙi.
I can't use it.	Ba zan iya amfani da shi ba.
I'll check it out too.	Zan duba shi ma.
It's bigger now.	Ya fi girma yanzu.
Find out how !.	Gano yadda!.
Then close.	Sai a rufe.
Like, early and early.	Kamar, da wuri da wuri.
Write them down.	Ka rubuta su.
Of course she was like me, she was almost three years old.	Tabbas ta kasance kamar ni, tana kusan shekara uku.
He moved forward.	Ya koma gaba.
I can see a lot of progress for him.	Ina iya ganin ci gaba sosai a gare shi.
I'll go for a walk later.	Zan tafi da tafiya a baya.
But it seems too much, too fast.	Amma da alama yayi yawa, yayi sauri.
Do not read too much into this.	Kar ku karanta da yawa cikin wannan.
He does not take it easy.	Ba ya ɗauka zuwa gare ta cikin sauƙi.
You have to look at people.	Dole ne ku kalli mutane.
I felt close.	Na ji kusa.
You can't do things.	Ba za ku iya yin abubuwa ba.
Fear of everything.	Tsoron komai.
I can't do that.	Ba zan iya yin hakan ba.
And it is not known exactly how that will be.	Kuma ba a san ainihin yadda hakan zai kasance ba.
Of course that's fine.	Tabbas hakan yayi kyau.
Little does anyone know what is in his head.	Kadan mutum ya san abin da ke cikin kansa.
My coffee is cold.	Kofi na yayi sanyi.
Then we got used to it.	Sai muka saba.
It should not be so.	Bai kamata ya kasance haka ba.
But of course there is no time to do that.	Amma ba shakka babu lokacin yin hakan.
I do not know where he is.	Ban san inda yake ba.
But there is no running.	Amma babu gudu.
He has no beginning and will never have an end.	Ba shi da farko kuma ba zai da ƙarshe.
First, it is a time-consuming process.	Na farko, hanya ce mai ɗaukar ɗan lokaci.
It does not stop.	Ba ya daina.
People know who you are.	Mutane sun san ko kai wanene.
The car is late.	Motar ta makara.
It just doesn't happen.	Kawai ba faruwa.
Maybe he was.	Wataƙila ya kasance.
We are more advanced now.	Mun fi ci gaba a yanzu.
We can no longer use it.	Ba za mu iya amfani da shi kuma.
I enjoy watching it.	Ina jin daɗin kallon sa.
Nothing interesting came out.	Babu wani abin sha'awa da ya fito.
He was eventually apprehended by an unknown man.	Wanda ba a san shi ba ya kama shi a ƙarshe.
It's easy.	Sauƙi yayi.
The only problem is how to do it.	Matsalar kawai ita ce yadda za a yi.
I have been doing this for a long time.	Na dade ina yin haka.
So sleep did not come.	Don haka barci bai zo ba.
That is why you must get up immediately.	Shi ya sa dole ne ku tashi nan da nan.
We need.	Muna bukata.
Maybe, but not sad.	Wataƙila, amma ba bakin ciki ba.
In.	A cikin.
He agreed to be there.	Ya yarda ya kasance a wurin.
Someone is coming this way.	Wani yana zuwa ta wannan hanya.
We are ready to move on.	Mun shirya don ci gaba.
I hope no one hears.	Ina fata babu wanda ya ji.
After all, that is not the case.	Bayan haka, ba haka bane.
Of course not.	Tabbas ba haka bane.
I do not think of anything.	Ba na tunanin komai.
You are dead.	Kun mutu.
Even more so.	Har ma ya fi haka.
But she is cold.	Amma tana da sanyi.
It was the second of her years.	Shi ne na biyu daga gare ta na shekara.
If you fail, go and try another time or day.	Idan kun kasa, yi tafiya kuma gwada wani lokaci ko rana.
Done for.	An gama don.
They will still happen.	Har yanzu za su faru.
Everything will change.	Komai zai canza.
We are very happy with the response.	Mun yi matukar farin ciki da amsa.
He needed this weekend.	Ya bukata wannan karshen mako.
This was found in two children.	An gano wannan a cikin yara biyu.
I think they made a mistake.	Ina jin sun yi kuskure.
Of course this is not true.	Tabbas wannan ba gaskiya bane.
Maybe that would be fine, though.	Wataƙila hakan zai yi kyau, ko da yake.
Every life, really.	Kowace rayuwa, da gaske.
Provide tools quickly.	Ba da kayan aikin da sauri.
Now, people have forgotten that.	Yanzu, mutane sun manta da wannan.
They think you are better.	Suna tsammanin kun fi kyau.
I began to accept it.	Na fara yarda da shi.
Otherwise, he wants to walk closer to him.	In ba haka ba, yana son tafiya kusa da shi.
If we just learn what we don’t know, it’s not enough.	Idan kawai mun koyi abin da ba mu sani ba, bai isa ba.
So they can be identified.	Don haka ana iya gano su.
She loves you.	Tana son ku.
I can hear them.	Zan iya ji da su.
These decisions will be made in the future, of course.	Za a yanke waɗannan shawarar nan gaba, ba shakka.
It seems to be more than that.	Da alama ta fi haka.
It's raining a lot here every year.	Ana yin ruwan sama mai yawa a nan kowace shekara.
He would not have come.	Da ma bai zo ba.
They just want to make it work as it is.	Suna so kawai su sa shi aiki kamar yadda yake.
No bad work.	Babu mummunan aiki.
This is what we hope to achieve.	Wannan shi ne abin da muka yi fatan samu.
Not interesting enough.	Ba ban sha'awa isa.
Not very interesting.	Ba mai ban sha'awa sosai ba.
Other than that, nothing really.	Ban da wannan, babu abin da gaske.
These thoughts made me very happy.	Waɗannan tunanin sun ba ni farin ciki sosai.
I think it is, a little bit.	Ina tsammanin shi ne, kadan kadan.
I told him she was dead.	Na ce masa ta mutu.
I need to be with you.	Ina bukata in kasance tare da ku.
This is something you should be familiar with.	Wannan kuma wani abu ne da ya kamata ku saba da shi.
Here she is.	Ga ta nan.
It just came out.	Ya fito kawai.
I need to hear.	Ina bukata in ji.
I really like it.	Ina son shi sosai.
It must be so if she thinks.	Dole ta kasance haka idan ta yi tunani.
But so do most people.	Amma haka mafi yawan mutane.
They are thirty years old.	Sun kai shekaru talatin.
Who is he?	Wanene shi.
There is still no answer.	Har yanzu babu amsa.
That would be difficult.	Da zai yi wahala.
I stood inside.	Na tsaya daga ciki.
I'd rather stay home than go.	Gara in zauna a gida da in tafi.
I only use what you give me.	Abin da ka ba ni kawai nake amfani da shi.
Tell me what was said.	Faɗa mini abin da aka ce.
It's a quick way to express your thoughts.	Hanya ce mai sauri don bayyana tunanin ku.
I offered my help.	Na ba da taimako na.
Come and come.	Ku zo ku zo.
More than that, she thought.	Ya fi haka, ta yi tunani.
It's useless.	Ba shi da amfani.
Now it's over.	Yanzu ya kare.
I can tell you what.	Zan iya gaya muku ko menene.
It will still work.	Har yanzu za a yi aiki.
You are ready now.	Kun shirya yanzu.
When life is good, very little is done.	Idan rayuwa ta yi kyau, kadan ne ake yin ta.
You must know that.	Dole ne ku san hakan.
It is still in progress though.	Har yanzu yana kan ci gaba ko da yake.
Rain has become increasingly uncertain.	Ruwan sama ya zama mai ƙara rashin tabbas.
He is still here.	Har yanzu yana nan.
However, a little like the one we joined, they are bigger.	Duk da haka, kaɗan kamar wanda muka shiga, sun fi girma.
There we are with them.	Akwai mu da su.
It is a good time of the year.	Lokaci ne mai kyau na shekara.
It will take some time before this event is over.	Zai ɗauki lokaci kafin a wuce wannan taron.
Maybe you can talk to her.	Wataƙila za ku iya magana da ita.
It's a place.	Wuri ne.
But they will change.	Amma za su canza.
It may be because it is a last chance.	Zai iya zama saboda dama ce ta ƙarshe.
Of course she was.	Tabbas ta kasance.
He likes a lot of things.	Yana son abubuwa da yawa.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
Obviously, he knows where they are.	Babu shakka, ya san inda suke.
The ground is slowly cooling.	Kasa tana sanyi a hankali.
Do not hurt.	Kada ku ji rauni.
They will run away and get married.	Za su gudu su yi aure.
And we will be back.	Kuma za mu dawo.
Simply, not the best.	Kawai, ba mafi kyau ba.
But they can do that.	Amma za su iya yin hakan.
It doesn't look like anything out there.	Ba kamar wani abu ba ne a can.
Before we meet.	Kafin mu hadu.
People are afraid to take them.	Mutane suna jin tsoron ɗaukar su.
Maybe we are not progressing as we think.	Wataƙila ba mu ci gaba kamar yadda muke tunani ba.
Almost everyone enters early.	Kusan kowa ya shiga da wuri.
However, he was right.	Duk da haka, ya yi daidai.
Just wait for it to come out.	Kawai su jira shi ya fita.
But he never got a chance.	Amma bai taba samun damar ba.
You can't believe he wants to see it through.	Ba za ku yarda cewa yana son ganin yadda abin yake ba.
Something to make you think.	Wani abu don sa ku tunani.
That can't be.	Wannan ba zai iya zama ba.
Now they move forward.	Yanzu sun yi gaba.
Not difficult anymore.	Ba wuya kuma.
Just don't want to be here.	Kamar ba ku son zama a nan.
Let's take a chance.	Mu dauki dama.
It was a full year.	Shekara ce ta cika.
Let's go and live there.	Mu je mu zauna a can.
Bad, interesting, all.	Mummunan, mai ban sha'awa, duka.
They do not know.	Ba su sani ba.
We suspect a man.	Muna zargin wani mutum.
I am very happy with this.	Na yi matukar farin ciki da wannan.
I think this is a bad thing.	Ina ganin wannan mummunan abu ne.
The thought of watching will kill me.	Tunanin kallon zai kashe ni.
She will never get it again.	Ba za ta sake samun shi ba.
Maybe we should call it a day.	Wataƙila ya kamata mu kira shi a rana.
I was back, in the first week, I didn’t get anything.	Na kasance a baya, a cikin mako na farko, ban sami komai ba.
Attention began to rise.	Hankali ya fara tashi.
Good food too.	Abinci mai kyau kuma.
It will not hurt to be prepared.	Ba zai yi zafi a shirya ba.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
That's what we call them.	Abin da muke kira su ke nan.
We will do it again.	Za mu sake yi.
Before that, everything was fine.	Kafin haka komai yayi kyau.
He stood outside and not in a good way.	Ya tsaya a waje kuma ba ta hanya mai kyau ba.
Not prepared.	Ba a shirya ba.
But he enjoys talking to them.	Amma yana jin daɗin magana da su.
I do not understand.	Ban gane ba.
You and I, it can still happen.	Kai da ni, har yanzu yana iya faruwa.
Despite the difficulties, they must continue.	Duk da wahala, dole ne su ci gaba.
Anyone can hear.	Kowa zai iya ji.
Not allowed.	Ba a yarda ba.
It's been a long time.	Ya dade sosai.
She admits to lying to her.	Ta yarda karya yayi mata.
The flight is on time, as usual.	Jirgin yana kan lokaci, kamar kullum.
Maybe she hasn’t lost her way.	Watakila ba ta rasa yadda za ta yi ba.
She should have seen it.	Kamata yayi ta gani.
They never paid.	Ba su taba biya ba.
Sorry you did not participate.	Yi hakuri ba ku shiga.
He could not continue.	Ya kasa ci gaba.
However, it works equally well with others around and.	Duk da haka, yana aiki daidai da sauran a kusa da kuma.
That's all.	Haka kawai.
Had he had it, she would not have been there.	Da yana da shi, da ba za ta kasance a wurin ba.
Others are worried.	Sauran sun damu.
They did nothing.	Ba su yi komai ba.
I told her again.	Na sake fada mata.
He told me one time it would not be a problem.	Ya ce mini lokaci daya ba zai zama matsala ba.
This is back.	Wannan ya dawo.
Everyone wants to have fun.	Kowa yana son jin dadi.
Now everything will be fine.	Yanzu komai zai yi kyau.
And you are late.	Kuma kun makara.
And be with you.	Kuma ku kasance tare da ku.
Where did he go?	Ina ya tafi?
Maybe there is a chance there.	Wataƙila akwai wata dama a wurin.
I want people to go for it.	Ina so mutane su je don shi.
Actually, this is not the case.	A gaskiya, wannan ba haka ba ne.
It shows one woman.	Ya nuna mata daya.
I do not know how to start.	Ban san yadda zan fara ba.
We do not know the method they used for this.	Ba mu san hanyar da suka yi amfani da ita don wannan ba.
I turned it on safely, too.	Na kunna shi lafiya, kuma.
You should also know.	Ya kamata ku sani kuma.
We talked about everything.	Mun yi magana game da komai.
She lifts her head and waits.	Ta daga kai tana jira.
It was difficult at first in school, he said.	Yana da wuya a farko a makaranta, in ji shi.
Change title	Canza take
I don’t know how they all remembered it.	Ban san yadda suka tuna da shi duka ba.
He has not worked for years.	Ya yi shekaru bai yi aiki ba.
It's really amazing, really.	Yana da ban mamaki sosai, da gaske.
Hopefully they will reach him.	Da fatan za su isa gare shi.
I played it many times too.	Na yi wasa da shi sau da yawa kuma.
He didn't pay, he thought.	Bai biya ba, ya yi tunani.
Less than that.	Kasa da haka.
I really like you.	Ina son ku da gaske.
I must say, she did a good job.	Dole ne in ce, ta yi aiki mai kyau.
Right or wrong.	Dama ko kuskure.
Nothing happened.	Babu wani abu da ya faru.
Work often requires me to work at night.	Aiki sau da yawa yana bukatar in yi aiki a cikin dare.
Now I feel really good.	Yanzu ina jin kaina sosai.
I can live on passion.	Zan iya rayuwa akan sha'awa.
He is in a state of ecstasy.	Yana cikin farin ciki.
He could not, whether this place was real.	Bai iya ba, ko wannan wurin gaskiya ne.
Can't worry.	Ba za a iya damu ba.
It is God, not us.	Allah ne, ba mu ba.
The same is true today.	A yau ma haka ne.
They’re interesting, but not necessarily.	Suna da ban sha'awa, amma ba lallai ba ne.
He does not do what he says.	Ba ya yin abin da ya ce.
He was serious about that statement, and he did.	Ya zama da gaske game da wannan magana, kuma ya yi.
So it would be like.	Don haka zai zama kamar.
I do not know if it was or not.	Ban sani ba ko ya kasance ko a'a.
They have to go.	Dole ne su tafi.
It's cold outside!	Yayi sanyi a waje!
She felt something wrong.	Ta ji wani abu ba daidai ba.
You should all come.	Ya kamata ku zo duka.
He also loves to have lunch with you.	Shi ma yana son cin abincin rana tare da ku.
You do not know how much.	Ba ku san nawa ba.
Everyone in the house had to work.	Kowa a gidan nan sai ya yi aiki.
We agreed that we could not see anything.	Mun yarda da cewa ba za mu iya ganin komai ba.
Until he wanted them to know who he was.	Har sai da ya so su san ko shi wane ne.
I love the first one, no story has done me any good.	Ina son na farko, babu labarin da ya yi min kyau.
The moon is visible tonight.	Ana ganin wata a daren yau.
They are not used to it.	Ba su saba da shi ba.
Or he may not agree.	Ko kuma bai yarda da ita ba.
I haven't finished it yet.	Ban gama shi ba tukuna.
It was like a big development for me.	Ya kasance kamar babban ci gaba a gare ni.
Like, she couldn't believe it.	Kamar, ta kasa yarda da hakan.
Would you show me the bus stop nearby, please?	Za a iya nuna mani tashar bas da ke kusa, don Allah?
No one can force us to do what we do not want to do.	Babu wanda zai iya sa mu yi abin da ba mu so.
The others left.	Sauran suka tafi.
No one cares.	Babu wanda ya damu.
I know how cold it is.	Na san nawa yayi sanyi.
I highly recommend that.	Ina ba da shawarar hakan sosai.
Of course I will try this.	Tabbas zan gwada wannan.
The decision is final.	Shawarar ita ce ta ƙarshe.
He does not hear.	Ba ya ji.
It's scary.	Abu ne mai ban tsoro.
It can do some amazing things.	Zai iya yin wasu abubuwa masu ban mamaki.
You have to bring it here to see this.	Dole ne ku kawo ta nan don ganin wannan.
Then things started to happen.	Daga nan sai abubuwa masu ban mamaki suka fara faruwa.
And it went on.	Kuma hakan ya ci gaba.
That's what we got.	Abin da muka samu kenan.
She made more mistakes than right.	Ta yi kuskure fiye da daidai.
It is a cause for rejoicing.	Yana da dalilin farin ciki.
We need to find what we can do.	Muna buƙatar samun abin da za mu iya yi.
I do not want to go.	Ba na son tafiya.
It came from outside.	Ya fito daga waje.
So, this is a very happy year.	Don haka, wannan shekara ce mai daɗi sosai.
She loves it.	Tana son shi.
You know, I really am.	Ka sani, ni na gaske.
Not a lot.	Ba wani yawa ba.
It's good we're here.	Yana da kyau muna nan.
You see a lot of worldly things.	Kun ga abubuwan duniya da yawa.
Either way they will get it.	Ko ta yaya za su samu.
I am healthy and happy.	Ina lafiya kuma ina farin ciki.
Now comes a big surprise.	Yanzu ya zo babban abin mamaki.
This may not be correct.	Wannan ba zai iya zama daidai ba.
Which is hard.	Abin da ke da wuya.
But then, it is not necessary.	Amma sai, ba dole ba ne.
Think she has a lot of things to do with it.	Ka yi tunanin tana da abubuwa da yawa da shi.
I wouldn’t mind them though.	Ba zan damu da su ba ko da yake.
The way she likes it.	Yadda ta so shi.
That's it.	Haka ke nan.
I will not do this to you.	Ba zan yi wannan da ku ba.
Good time.	Da kyau lokaci.
He was immediately very tired.	Nan take ya gaji sosai.
Elsewhere, there is no familiarity.	A wani waje, babu saba.
We know where to look.	Mun san inda za mu duba.
So, we were all on the road.	Don haka, duk mun kasance a hanya.
Such a thing is not uncommon.	Ba a saba da irin wannan abu ba.
I do not know what that will be.	Ban san me hakan zai kasance ba.
It does not take anything away from anyone.	Ba ya ɗaukar komai daga kowa.
Now she is alone and on the move.	Yanzu ita kadai kuma tana tafiya.
Much has not yet been done.	Da yawa har yanzu ba a yi ba.
But again, that left me cold.	Amma kuma, wannan ya bar ni sanyi.
Everything is still fine.	Har yanzu komai yana aiki lafiya.
You may feel sick if you have a cold.	Kuna iya jin rashin lafiya idan kun yi sanyi.
Little reason he was afraid of us.	Kadan dalilin da ya sa ya ji tsoron mu.
He must have seen this before.	Ya tabbata ya taba ganin wannan a baya.
Everything is still fine.	Komai har yanzu yayi kyau.
Wrong.	Ba daidai ba.
It seemed like a lot.	Ya zama kamar mai yawa.
He immediately failed to explain why he had killed her.	Nan take ya kasa bayyana dalilin da ya sa ya kashe ta.
The real one is back.	An dawo da na gaske.
I will explain that.	Zan bayyana hakan.
We will take care of this later.	Za mu kula da wannan a gaba.
But she did not think so.	Amma bata yi tunanin haka ba.
She knows better now.	Ta fi sani yanzu.
Everything has changed.	Komai ya canza.
I can't imagine being bigger.	Ba zan iya tunanin zama mafi girma.
The food is very good.	Abincin yana da kyau sosai.
And get out.	Kuma fita.
But there are many other things they do.	Amma akwai sauran abubuwa da yawa da suke yi.
Just yesterday for me.	Kamar jiya a gare ni.
You will never.	Ba za ku taba ba.
And that's what you'll find out.	Kuma abin da za ku gano ke nan.
Everything needs to move forward.	Komai yana buƙatar ci gaba.
No problem with them.	Babu matsala da su.
Check it out to see if it is safe.	Ku duba ta ku gani ko lafiya.
We understand it now you can.	Mun gane shi yanzu za ku iya.
But only you can do it.	Amma kai kaɗai ne za ka iya yi.
He should study.	Ya kamata yayi karatu.
All you want is for someone to show that he cares.	Duk abin da kuke so shine wani ya nuna cewa ya damu.
Not if you do not want to.	Ba idan ba ka so.
The man was amazing.	Mutumin ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
Allow me to explain.	Ka ba ni dama in bayyana.
I really agree.	Na yarda sosai.
At home too.	A gida kuma.
They can not be.	Ba za su iya zama ba.
Almost a lot, how.	Kusan da yawa, ta yaya.
I haven't tried it but it should work.	Ban gwada shi ba amma ya kamata ya yi aiki.
Not all, however.	Ba duka ba, duk da haka.
In fact, this is not enough.	A gaskiya, wannan bai isa ba.
I said I should call you.	Na ce in kira ka.
What's the matter.	Akwai matsala.
Everyone except us.	Kowa sai mu.
Take what they give you.	Dauki abin da suka ba ku.
But he replied that it was me or not anyone.	Amma ya amsa da cewa ni ne ko ba kowa.
She doesn't want to talk to anyone.	Bata son magana da kowa.
You need that today.	Kuna buƙatar hakan a yau.
We must find out exactly how much he knows, quickly.	Dole ne mu gano ainihin nawa ya sani, da sauri.
He met someone.	Ya hadu da wani.
We should spend some of your money to help.	Ya kamata mu kashe wasu kuɗin ku don taimako.
And not everyone can be arrested at work too.	Kuma ba kowa ba ne za a iya kama shi a wurin aiki ma.
It should be delivered immediately.	Sai a kai masa da sauri.
Keep finding out what they enjoy their work.	Ci gaba da gano abin da suke jin daɗin aikin su.
It's a pleasure.	Abin farin ciki ne.
This is the most comfortable place in the house.	Wannan ita ce wurin zama mafi dadi a cikin gidan.
I understand how real that is.	Na fahimci yadda hakan yake da gaske.
They could not bring her back.	Sun kasa dawo da ita.
I love it so much.	Ina son shi don haka.
It’s nothing new for the moment.	Ba sabon abu ba ne don lokacin.
He told me what had happened.	Ya ba ni labarin abin da ya faru.
You can save a little time this way.	Kuna iya ajiye ɗan lokaci kaɗan ta haka.
It is not true.	Ba gaskiya ba ne.
I am a worker.	Ni ne mai aikin.
This is a difficult thing.	Wannan abu ne mai wahala.
But he failed.	Amma ya kasa yi.
Leave us!	Ka bar mu!
I don't think so.	Ina tsammanin ba haka bane.
I'm tired of it.	Na gaji da shi.
That's for sure.	A kan haka ya tabbata.
He makes her agree to die.	Ya sa ta yarda ya mutu.
Make a seat.	Yayi wurin zama.
I am, really.	Ni ne, da gaske.
You did that.	Kun yi haka.
I don't remember it.	Bata tuna shi ba.
But you can not.	Amma ba za ku iya ba.
For the weak.	Ga masu rauni.
And of course they do.	Kuma ba shakka suna yi.
It was not difficult, nor was it easy.	Bai kasance mai wahala ba, kuma ba mai sauƙi ba ne.
It gives me a lot of help.	Yana ba ni taimako da yawa.
I can really see there.	Ina iya gani sosai a can.
He does not hit back.	Baya buga baya.
It's too fast.	Yayi sauri sosai.
You will be amazed at the things that will come to you.	Za ku yi mamakin abubuwan da za su zo muku.
Let's prepare for it.	Mu shirya masa.
We are doing well.	Muna yin kyau.
Find an interesting problem here.	Samu matsala mai ban sha'awa a nan.
Maybe he’ll do a little reading.	Wataƙila zai yi ɗan karatu.
How big.	Nawa girma.
Don't ask me who I am.	Kar ka tambaye ni wanene.
We'll see next year.	Za mu gani a shekara mai zuwa.
They can make us cry.	Za su iya sa mu kuka.
But not there.	Amma ba a can.
That's all we heard.	Abin da muka ji kawai ke nan.
It is not so.	Ba haka yake ba.
That person is not.	Wannan mutumin ba shine ba.
She decided that she would pay him.	Ta yanke shawarar cewa za ta biya shi.
And they will not be helped.	Kuma ba za a taimake su ba.
Let them be sure of that.	Su tabbata a kan haka.
I have never seen anything like it.	Ban taba ganin irin wannan abu ba.
You know, they do a lot of things right now.	Ka sani, suna yin abubuwa da yawa a yanzu.
I just read about it.	Ina karanta game da shi kawai.
He used to drink water before eating.	Ya kan sha ruwa kafin ya ci abinci.
Many people are crying.	Mutane da yawa suna kuka.
For many it is difficult.	Mutane da yawa yana da wuya.
She was devastated.	Ta bata rai komai.
She had to wait.	Sai da ta jira.
But it is not a car.	Amma ba mota ba ce.
I am leaving tomorrow.	Zan tafi gobe.
It will never happen, it will never happen again.	Ba zai faru ba, ba zai taɓa faruwa da gaske ba.
So, good job.	Don haka, aiki mai kyau.
Maybe he was right.	Wataƙila ya yi gaskiya.
The room is hot.	Dakin yayi zafi.
A place can be found here.	Za a iya samun wuri a nan.
I went and sat next to him.	Na je na zauna kusa da shi.
He can identify the person he wants.	Ya iya gane mutumin da yake so.
She also doesn’t like rain, when it comes right.	Ita ma ba ta son ruwan sama, lokacin da ya zo daidai.
She can't do without it.	Ba za ta iya yi ba tare da ita ba.
One down, one on the go.	Daya kasa, daya a tafi.
Maybe we should call it that.	Wataƙila mu kira shi.
I don't see anyone playing like that.	Ban ga kowa yana wasa haka ba.
She will not leave a mark.	Ba za ta bar wata alama ba.
That did her good.	Cewa yayi mata kyau.
It was a surprise.	Ya zama abin mamaki.
He asked her.	Ya tambaye ta.
It happened after that statement.	Hakan ya faru ne bayan wannan magana.
But he failed, still.	Amma ya kasa, har yanzu.
This is a domestic problem.	Wannan matsala ce ta gida.
But that is life.	Amma haka rayuwa take.
We have never been to this before.	Ba mu taba zuwa a baya ba.
Of thing.	Na abu.
She had trouble sleeping that night.	Ta sami matsala barci a wannan dare.
Look at this man.	Ku kalli wannan mutumin.
If we do not make progress.	Idan ba mu samu ci gaba ba.
I had to figure out what was going on.	Dole ne in gano abin da ke faruwa.
We accept it.	Mun yarda da shi.
I don't want to live that way.	Ba na son rayuwa haka.
All of you make me think.	Ku duka ku sa ni tunani.
This statement is also correct.	Wannan magana ma daidai ce.
There is nothing to do now.	Babu wani abu da za a yi yanzu.
You know how things go.	Kun san yadda abubuwan suke tafiya.
Everyone else.	Duk sauran.
However, it is not.	Duk da haka, ba haka ba ne.
And here it is.	Kuma ga shi.
It's a good game.	Wasa ce mai kyau.
Maybe she also wants that.	Watakila kuma tana son hakan.
It's not easy.	Ba shi da sauƙi.
That he wants to live again.	Cewa yana so ya sake rayuwa.
I don’t know what to think about it.	Ban san abin da zan yi tunani game da shi ba.
An unusual name.	Sunan da ba a saba gani ba.
Nothing has ever worked in the past.	Babu wani abu da ya taɓa yin aiki a baya.
They are full and ready to go.	Sun cika kuma suna shirin tafiya.
But this is bigger.	Amma wannan ya fi girma.
In fact, everything happens altogether.	A gaskiya ma, duk abin da ke faruwa gaba ɗaya.
Don't worry about it.	Kada ku damu da shi.
Do not be afraid.	Kada ku ji tsoro.
I’ve never done that, and I never will.	Ban taba yin haka ba, kuma ba zan taba yi ba.
This will eventually kill you.	Wannan zai kashe ku a ƙarshe.
These can be early.	Waɗannan na iya zama da wuri.
So he didn't get it.	Don haka bai samu ba.
They should do and talk about it.	Ya kamata su yi kuma su yi magana game da shi.
On the job.	Akan aikin.
Maybe she didn’t.	Watakila ba ta yi ba.
No wonder she agreed.	Ba mamaki ta yarda.
I didn't say anything, of course.	Ban ce komai ba, tabbas.
We don't want to go back there.	Ba ma so mu koma can.
And we can look at that.	Kuma muna iya kallon hakan.
I need to tell you again.	Ina bukata in sake gaya muku.
Start with something you know.	Fara da wani abu da ka sani.
I shouldn’t recommend it.	Bai kamata in ba da shawarar ba.
But if she does not.	Amma idan ba ta yi ba.
It's hot.	Zafi ne.
There is running water somewhere.	Akwai ruwan gudu a wani wuri.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Either way, it's not.	Ko ta yaya, ba haka ba.
He is more interested in writing songs.	Ya fi sha'awar rubuta waƙa.
We live with it.	Muna rayuwa da shi.
Can't you see what is happening here?	Ba ka ganin abin da ke faruwa a nan?
This is the outside.	Wannan shi ne waje.
He wondered how long it would take them.	Ya yi mamakin tsawon lokacin da za a kai su.
I don't know how it works, but it works.	Ban san yadda yake aiki ba, amma yana aiki.
The first world after this.	Duniya ta farko bayan wannan.
He told her so, several times.	Ya gaya mata haka, sau da yawa.
It seems not to be missed.	Da alama ba a rasa.
Together you work a lot and even talk more.	Tare kuna aiki da yawa har ma da ƙarin magana.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?	Wanene ya san abin da zai faru gobe?.
But he stopped.	Amma ya daina.
But it is amazing.	Amma yana da ban mamaki.
She did not.	Ba ta yi ba.
And that's where it started.	Kuma daga nan ne aka fara.
This material does not fly very well.	Wannan kayan baya tashi sosai.
He still agrees.	Har yanzu ya yarda.
I came back safe and sound.	Na dawo lafiya.
I think he left the room at the end.	Ina tsammanin ya bar dakin a karshen.
And this is a problem from start to finish.	Kuma wannan matsala ce daga farko har ƙarshe.
They can see and help us to see.	Suna iya gani kuma suna taimaka mana mu gani.
We stopped talking.	Muka tsaya magana.
That's all you know.	Abin da kuka sani ke nan.
We are the next.	Mu ne na gaba.
Real life.	Rayuwa ta gaske.
Not many, but some.	Ba yawa, amma wasu.
They said no.	Suka ce a'a.
They walk slowly.	Suna tafiya a hankali.
Lost in the rain.	An rasa a cikin ruwan sama.
In the morning they went together.	Da safe suka tafi tare.
I will no longer make trouble.	Ba zan ƙara yin matsala ba.
Another tomorrow.	Wani gobe.
This is a great thing, but not enough.	Wannan abu ne mai girma, amma bai isa ba.
Life goes a long way.	Rayuwa ta shiga hanya.
Things are much easier now.	Abubuwa sun fi sauƙi a yanzu.
Maybe it just was.	Watakila abin ya kasance kawai.
We will not allow that to happen.	Ba za mu yarda hakan ta faru ba.
I do not know what will happen tomorrow.	Ban san me zai faru gobe ba.
I want to give you all me.	Ina so in ba ku duka ni.
One knows.	Daya ta sani.
I think we will never come here.	Ina tsammanin ba za mu taba zuwa nan ba.
You have to go right.	Dole ne ku tafi daidai.
But maybe it is not.	Amma watakila ba shi ba ne.
I want to read them.	Ina so in karanta su.
If you ever miss it.	Idan kun taɓa rasa shi.
I will be happy to have a home.	Zan yi farin ciki da samun gida.
Please let me in and she cries.	Don Allah bari in shiga ta yi kuka.
Nothing was wrong at the time.	Babu wani abu da ya ji ba daidai ba a lokacin.
But that led to a trip.	Amma hakan ya kai ga tafiya.
He said.	Ya fad'a.
And as I did to work.	Kuma kamar yadda na yi don aiki.
We must help her.	Dole ne mu taimaka mata.
These look amazing.	Waɗannan suna kama da ban mamaki.
How much water do you need?	Ruwa nawa kuke bukata?
He has written extensively.	Ya rubuta da yawa.
We enjoyed a good dinner.	Mun ji daɗin abincin dare mai kyau.
What kind of food is this?	Wane irin abinci ne wannan?
They do not expect to see change.	Ba sa fatan ganin ya canza.
I will not be late.	Ba zan makara ba.
He proved it.	Ya tabbatar da hakan.
I do not feel comfortable.	Ban ji dadi ba.
They would have been arrested.	Da an kama su.
Something else is just wishful thinking.	Wani abu kuma tunanin fata ne kawai.
But not too close, of course.	Amma ba ma kusa ba, ba shakka.
He did not bother to ask for anything from her.	Bai damu ba ya nemi wani abu daga gare ta.
They do nothing.	Ba sa yin komai.
She used to make wedding dresses.	Ta kasance tana yin kayan aure.
I decided I wouldn’t do it myself.	Na yanke shawarar ba zan yi da kaina ba.
I'm laughing	Ina ban dariya
Do not come near!	Kar ku zo kusa!
This route is the fastest route there.	Wannan hanya ita ce hanya mafi sauri a can.
She did many things, before him.	Ta yi abubuwa da yawa, kafin shi.
Always go out in the sun.	Koyaushe fita cikin rana.
He is ready to the end.	Ya shirya zuwa karshen.
The back door is open.	Kofar baya ta bude.
I did it for a year.	Na yi shi tsawon shekara guda.
It seems really hard.	Da alama gaske wuya.
Let's start again.	Bari mu fara a sake.
I hope so.	Na yi fatan haka.
He did not stop there.	Bai tsaya nan ba.
I can say a lot.	Zan iya fada da yawa.
Everything was interesting.	Komai ya kasance mai ban sha'awa.
He was there to help him.	Ya kasance don taimaka masa.
It happened and we just took advantage of the opportunity.	Hakan ya faru kuma mun yi amfani da damar kawai.
They can be found here.	Ana iya samun su a nan.
He remembers when everything went well.	Ya tuna lokacin da komai yayi kyau.
Eating is fun, you know.	Cin abin sha'awa ne, ka sani.
Twelve at most.	Sha biyu a mafi yawa.
No one wants to know anything.	Babu wanda ya so ya san komai.
I was very surprised, but they are still here.	Na yi mamaki sosai, amma har yanzu suna nan.
Slowly he ate and prepared well	A hankali ya ci abinci ya shirya sosai
We make funny calls all the time.	Muna yin kira na ban dariya kullum.
And not only that.	Kuma ba haka kawai ba.
I will wait for you.	Zan jira ku.
She did it because she loved it.	Ta yi shi saboda tana son shi.
She got up.	Ta tashi.
Don't you know? 	Ba ku sani ba?
saying.	yana cewa.
Things happen, people talk, talk comes out.	Abubuwa suna faruwa, mutane suna magana, magana ta fito.
Or if so, no one told me.	Ko idan haka ne, babu wanda ya gaya mani.
I can’t let that happen, just as you can’t.	Ba zan iya barin hakan ta faru ba, kamar yadda ba za ku iya ba.
In the morning he got up with her.	Da safe ya tashi da ita.
I can't go out.	Ba zan iya fita ba.
I'm not there now.	Ba na can a yanzu.
Come back anytime.	Dawo kowane lokaci.
That sounds like a mistake.	Hakan ya zama kamar kuskure.
You probably have a second opinion about us	Da alama kuna da tunani na biyu game da mu
She is funny and she is very beautiful.	Tana da ban dariya kuma tana da kyau sosai.
They are involved in the fulfillment.	Suna da hannu a cika.
She loves you, she loves you more than you can imagine.	Tana son ka, tana son ka kamar yadda ba za ka iya tunanin ba.
He is thought to be dead.	Ana tunanin zai mutu.
I can't stop crying.	Ba zan iya daina kuka ba.
However, this will not be the case.	Duk da haka, wannan ba zai kasance ba.
He was not ready for the day.	Bai shirya don ranar ba.
I left everyone.	Na bar kowa da kowa.
He is a dog.	Shi kare ne.
We saw they were not.	Mun ga ba su kasance ba.
All this will be taken care of.	Duk wannan za a kula da su.
It has been a great role model for our program.	Ya zama babban abin koyi ga shirin mu.
They had loved each other since childhood.	Sun kasance suna son juna tun suna yara.
So we ended up with a project.	Haka muka kare da wani aiki.
She did a great job.	Ta yi babban aiki.
That doesn't matter now.	Wannan ba komai yanzu.
But he hit the second one earlier.	Amma ya buga na biyu a baya.
We know him now.	Mun san shi yanzu.
See you soon!	Sai mun gani!.
I have no feelings for him one way or another.	Ba ni da wani ji a gare shi wata hanya ko wata.
He wasn't even sure she was wrong.	Bai ma tabbatar ta yi kuskure ba.
As hard as he missed the opportunity to do so.	Kamar yadda da wuya ya rasa damar yin hakan.
Come home early.	Ku zo gida da wuri.
He doesn't want you to know.	Bai so ku sani ba.
I have homework	Ina da aikin gida
So fun to do.	Don haka abin farin ciki ne don yin.
That you have to miss it somewhere.	Cewa dole ka rasa shi a wani wuri.
She found it difficult.	Ta sami hakan cikin wahala.
We were very happy from start to finish.	Mun yi matukar farin ciki daga farko har ƙarshe.
I can not be sure.	Ba zan iya tabbata ba.
It was a great job.	Ya kasance babban aiki sosai.
Stop thinking.	Ka daina tunani.
I was scared too, but together we were scared.	Na ji tsoro shi ma, amma tare muke tsoro.
It doesn't seem to fit the rest.	Da alama bata dace da sauran ba.
This dress is a favorite for girls.	Wannan rigar ta fi so ga 'yan mata.
I did not reach that.	Ban kai haka ba.
You know this for the best.	Kun san wannan don mafi kyau.
I don't think it's good.	Bana jin yana da kyau.
I let fear prevail.	Na bar tsoro ya ci nasara.
How amazing, right? 	Yaya ban mamaki, daidai?
.	.
I know you think we don't understand.	Na san kuna tunanin ba mu gane ba.
I have never done this and it is very interesting.	Ban taɓa yin wannan ba kuma yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
I didn't even know he was coming.	Ban ma san yana zuwa ba.
So maybe he didn't see anything really.	Don haka watakila bai ga wani abu da gaske ba.
I hope it comes soon.	Ina fatan zai zo da wuri.
It did not change anything.	Bai canza komai ba.
It’s good but it could be better.	Yana da kyau amma zai iya zama mafi kyau.
However perhaps we would not have been so surprised.	Duk da haka watakila da ba mu yi mamakin haka ba.
Absolutely not here.	Tabbas ba a nan.
Everyone is.	Kowa shi.
I like hot	Ina son zafi
If not, put it in the world.	Idan ba haka ba, saka a duniya.
So wait for me.	Don haka ku jira ni.
A lot can happen tonight.	Da yawa na iya faruwa a daren yau.
Why did he marry her?	Me yasa ya aure ta?
When he felt better it was time.	Lokacin da ya ji daɗi ya isa lokaci.
It has changed, though.	Ya canza, ko da yake.
I have to go for help.	Dole ne in je neman taimako.
She has no back, no front.	Ba ta da baya, ba ta gaba.
Things can’t kill me right now.	Abubuwan ba za su iya kashe ni yanzu ba.
I play all home games.	Ina duk wasan gida.
It doesn’t have to be much.	Ba sai ya zama da yawa ba.
She wanted the world to be a better place.	Ta so duniya ta zama wuri mafi kyau.
This is a mistake.	Wannan kuskure ne.
It has to be.	Dole ne ya kasance.
There is always next year.	Akwai ko da yaushe na gaba shekara.
Now you can.	Yanzu za ku iya.
It was a rainy day.	Ranar da aka yi ruwan sama.
I am human, and we need things.	Ni mutum ne, kuma muna bukatar abubuwa.
It will give me time.	Zai ba ni lokaci.
Somewhere, it's the first.	Wani wuri, yana da farko.
Get out of there and stand outside.	Fita daga can ku tsaya waje.
He did not care.	Bai damu ba.
His favorite thing is reading.	Abin da ya fi so shi ne karatu.
You hope something goes.	Kuna fatan wani abu zai tafi.
People think of other things.	Mutane suna tunanin wasu abubuwa.
There is another way.	Akwai wata hanya.
It's not good.	Bai yi kyau ba.
We all sit here together and have dinner.	Mu duka muna zaune a nan tare muna cin abincin dare.
She’s not going to show weakness here, she can’t.	Ba za ta nuna rauni a nan ba, ba za ta iya ba.
But other things will.	Amma sauran abubuwa za su.
And bring it to me.	Kuma ku kawo min shi.
He does not have to add.	Ba sai ya kara cewa ba.
And it's mine.	Kuma nawa ne.
He must remember what it is about here.	Dole ne ya tuna abin da yake game da nan.
I'm sure that won't be a problem.	Na tabbata hakan ba zai zama matsala ba.
That's what they use.	Abin da suke amfani da shi ke nan.
Why you should.	Me ya sa ya kamata ku.
This is where we spent the night.	A nan ne muka kwana a wannan dare.
I will try to figure out how to fix it.	Zan yi ƙoƙarin gano yadda zan gyara shi.
At the time it was empty.	A lokacin ba komai.
The victim said he was scared.	Wanda aka kashe yace yana tsoro.
They want to win, they want to fight.	Suna son yin nasara, suna son yin fada.
I eat three meals a day.	Ina cin abinci sau uku a rana.
But he failed, still.	Amma ya kasa, har yanzu.
You made a mistake, you know!	Kun yi kuskure, kun sani!
No one knows.	Babu wanda ya sani.
It's not over.	Bata fad'a ba.
I must assume that you are accustomed to finding your way.	Dole ne in ɗauka cewa kun saba samun hanyar ku.
But some of them got cut, too.	Amma wasu daga ciki sun samu a yanke, ma.
There are many.	Akwai su da yawa.
Something with me.	Wani abu da ni.
This is helpful if you do not want to write it.	Wannan yana da taimako idan ba ku son rubuta shi.
Do it.	Yi shi.
They will not come in time.	Ba za su zo cikin lokaci ba.
It is not difficult to do this.	Ba shi da wuya a yi wannan.
But please do not worry.	Amma don Allah kar ku damu.
Expect that.	Yi tsammanin haka.
I doubt he will come back.	Ina shakka zai dawo.
But do not get into trouble.	Amma kada ku shiga cikin matsala.
But here comes a lot.	Amma a nan ya zo da yawa.
Just looking for time and place.	Sai kawai neman lokaci da wuri.
Again, and again.	Sake, da kuma sake.
You do a good job with them.	Kuna aiki mai kyau tare da su.
He made no mistake.	Bai yi kuskure ba.
Surprisingly, this never happened to me.	Abin mamaki, wannan bai taba faruwa da ni ba.
Once arrived.	Sau ɗaya ya isa.
And today is your first day.	Kuma yau ce ranar ku ta farko.
Here's how.	Ga yadda.
See how good everyone is.	Kalli yadda kowa yayi kyau.
He went to work.	Ya tafi aiki.
Or did he not.	Ko bai yi ba.
It was a great way for me.	Hanya ce mai girma a gare ni.
However, everyone agreed that something had to be done.	Duk da haka, kowa ya yarda cewa dole ne a yi wani abu.
No one knows if he killed anyone.	Babu wanda ya san ko ya kashe kowa.
She is very sick.	Bata da lafiya sosai.
It is a great undertaking.	Babban aiki ne da muka ɗauka.
And there are dogs.	Kuma akwai kare.
It doesn't seem to be the same.	Da alama bai zama irin ba.
She should know that.	Ya kamata ta san haka.
Maybe it should.	Wataƙila ya kamata.
But there are no people.	Amma babu mutane.
I want you to do that.	Ina so ku yi hakan.
I'll be back in a few years, of course.	Zan koma wasu shekaru, ba shakka.
I'm so glad you were able to do that.	Na yi farin ciki sosai da kuka iya yin hakan.
This is the second time.	Na biyu kenan.
Kids love to read this article.	Yara suna son karanta wannan labarin.
Exactly right, he was wrong.	Daidai daidai, yayi kuskure.
He knows how to take care of himself.	Ya san yadda zai kula da kansa.
It is not difficult.	Ba shi da wahala.
Certainly not.	Tabbas ba tsoro ba ne.
Go out and have fun.	Fita ku ji daɗi.
He proved it because he was alive.	Ya tabbatar da hakan saboda yana rayuwa.
These were amazing in this way.	Waɗannan sun kasance masu ban mamaki ta wannan hanya.
Think it might be easy to miss you here.	Yi tunanin yana iya zama da sauƙi a rasa ku a nan.
She was always tired even though she got up early.	Kullum ta gaji duk da ta tashi da wuri.
They brought you here.	Sun kawo ku nan.
But not right.	Amma ba daidai ba.
Here it is!	Ga shi!.
This place is beautiful.	Wannan wurin yana da kyau.
For more than a week I did not play.	Sama da mako guda ban buga wasa ba.
You focus on speed.	Kuna mai da hankali kan yin sauri.
Maybe there is progress.	Wataƙila akwai ci gaba.
That could be all this.	Wannan yana iya zama duk wannan.
It did not change anything.	Bai canza komai ba.
All right.	Duk ya yi daidai.
Some people will not like it.	Wasu mutane ba za su so shi ba.
He did not sell me.	Ko ba ta ni ba.
That would not be appropriate.	Hakan ba zai dace ba.
We have everything.	Muna da komai.
We could not access it.	Ba mu iya shiga gare shi ba.
He is with this now.	Ya kasance tare da wannan a yanzu.
They can see this.	Suna iya ganin wannan.
It's not good.	Bai yi kyau ba.
But he too will not help her.	Amma shi ma ba zai taimake ta ba.
I have to do what is required.	Dole ne in yi abin da ake bukata.
Hope that helped.	Da fatan hakan ya taimaka.
She's not that good.	Ba ta da kyau haka.
But no one comes out to ask who they are.	Amma ba wanda ya fito ya tambaye su ko su wane ne.
It is not so big.	Ba shi da girma haka.
All you have to do is wait.	Babu abin yi sai jira.
For a year or so, they forgot about it.	Shekara daya ko fiye da haka, sun manta da shi.
He spoke quickly.	Yayi magana cikin sauri.
It's loud.	Yana da kara.
I do not know them.	Ban san su ba.
It is easy to find out what happened yesterday.	Yana da sauƙi a gano abin da ya faru jiya.
Too much to sign up for.	Yayi yawa don shiga.
Cannot find out what it is.	Ba za a iya gano abin da yake ba.
This method is very good.	Wannan hanya tana da kyau sosai.
Printed or lost.	An buga ko rasa.
And you know that.	Kuma kun san wannan.
Yes, and no.	Haka ne, da kuma a'a.
Still do it to this day.	Duk da haka yi har yau.
Now, everyone knows it.	Yanzu, kowa ya san shi.
That will change.	Hakan zai canza.
Such optimism can seem like a mistake.	Irin wannan kyakkyawan fata na iya zama kamar kuskure.
Not at all.	Komai ba haka yake ba.
I do not know how.	Ban san yadda ba.
This is the way to make more money.	Wannan shine hanyar samun ƙarin kuɗi.
Truth wants to help.	Gaskiya yana so ya taimaka.
I think this is for a while.	Ina tsammanin wannan na wani lokaci ne.
No one can take care of another.	Babu wanda zai iya kula da wani.
And every day.	Kuma kowace rana.
Think about what you are doing here.	Yi tunanin abin da kuke yi a nan.
I saw people crying.	Na ga mutane suna kuka.
It tastes so good.	Yayi dadi sosai.
I am very happy.	Ina matukar farin ciki.
And we know you don't have that.	Kuma mun san cewa ba ku da wannan.
But you think that somewhere you will find someone who knows them.	Amma kuna tunanin cewa a wani wuri za a sami wanda ya san su.
We want to hear from you.	Muna son ji daga gare ku.
It was only for a short time.	Ya kasance na ɗan lokaci kawai.
In others, it is not.	A wasu kuma, bai kasance ba.
I arrived	Na isa
It's a big deal, as we thought.	Babban abu ne, kamar yadda muka yi tunani.
I was amazed at how he did it.	Na yi mamakin yadda ya yi.
I have had the same pleasure of watching you tonight.	Na sami irin wannan farin cikin kallon ku a daren yau.
It was late at night.	Har dare suka yi.
And of course he was.	Kuma ba shakka ya kasance.
Of course she was.	Tabbas ta kasance.
Whatever they wanted they got.	Duk abin da suke so sun samu.
God, how it did not work.	Allah, yadda ba a yi aiki ba.
And it can still be safe.	Kuma har yanzu yana iya zama lafiya.
And now we are not even talking.	Kuma yanzu ba a ma magana.
Some, however, do not fit.	Wasu, duk da haka, ba su dace ba.
It is the book he loves.	Littafin da yake so ne.
I'm going to do that now.	Zan tafi yin haka yanzu.
It works well here.	Yana aiki da kyau a nan.
You see.	Kun gani.
You can make it an international conference.	Kuna iya mai da shi taron duniya.
The school can use great intelligence too.	Makaranta na iya amfani da hankali sosai kuma.
You can not talk your way out of this.	Ba za ku iya magana hanyar ku daga wannan ba.
I want to return to play.	Ina so in dawo wasa.
It would be more sensible.	Zai zama mafi hankali.
I am the most intelligent.	Ni da yake sun fi hankali.
But there must be something.	Amma dole ne akwai wani abu.
He can't take care of it.	Ba zai iya kula da shi ba.
You brought this to yourselves.	Kun kawo wa kanku wannan.
It's smart.	Abu mai hankali.
It should be out within a month.	Ya kamata a fita a cikin wata guda.
We could not agree on the time of departure.	Ba mu iya yarda game da lokacin tashi ba.
That is what we want.	Abin da muke so ke nan.
It must be said.	Dole ne a ce.
This has happened to me a lot.	Wannan ya faru da ni da yawa.
This made waiting difficult.	Hakan ya sa jira ya yi wahala.
That's how you live.	Haka kuke rayuwa.
Nothing more.	Babu wani abu kuma.
Nothing to say.	Babu abin da za a faɗa.
She needs something sweet to eat.	Tana bukatar wani abu mai dadi da za ta ci.
She wants to do it again, she wants another chance.	Tana son sake yi, tana son wani dama.
This can tell us something.	Wannan zai iya gaya mana wani abu.
She would not be happy about that.	Ba za ta yi farin ciki da hakan ba.
Now it seems like the right time to do it.	Yanzu yana kama da lokacin da ya dace don yin hakan.
She is not well, he is worried.	Ba ta da lafiya, ya damu.
I don't feel anything one way or another.	Bana jin komai wata hanya ko wata.
She doesn't want anything.	Ba komai ta so.
They may be scared, they may get sick.	Suna iya jin tsoro, za su iya yin rashin lafiya.
And so it was and it is true.	Kuma haka ya kasance kuma gaskiya ce.
I hope it becomes a useful tool for others.	Ina fatan ya zama kayan aiki mai amfani ga wasu.
Intelligent people seem to get more and more knowledge.	Mutane masu hankali da alama suna samun ƙarin sani.
Others agree.	Wasu kuma sun yarda.
She knew it was a lie.	Ta san karya ce.
That didn't do anything.	Wannan bai yi komai ba.
You can finish this trip.	Kuna iya gama wannan tafiya.
Never assume you know everything or even enough.	Kada ku taɓa ɗauka kun san komai ko ma isa.
I'm afraid of you.	Ina jin tsoron ku.
Of course it is.	Tabbas haka ne.
She wants me to come and talk to her.	Tana so in zo in yi masa magana.
Want to hear it.	Son ji shi.
We tested you to know.	Mun gwada ka sani.
There is plenty of food to think about.	Akwai abinci da yawa don tunani.
He was given too much to drink.	An ba shi sha da yawa.
Take your first seat.	Ɗauki wurin zama na farko.
And so far, they say, that's not true.	Kuma ya zuwa yanzu, sun ce, hakan bai tabbata ba.
It seems wrong to let that happen.	Da alama kuskure ne a bar abin ya faru.
It will not pass!	Ba zai wuce ba!
They are about something that happened to me.	Suna game da wani abu da ya faru da ni.
Our next meeting is next month.	Taron mu na gaba wata mai zuwa ne.
He did not, nor did he look sad.	Bai yi ba, ko kallon bakin ciki bai yi ba.
This is the last day at work.	Wannan ita ce rana ta ƙarshe a wurin aiki.
He, too, was not well-liked.	Shi ma, ba a son shi sosai.
But you can't send them in your name.	Amma ba za ku iya aika su da sunan ku ba.
She is the problem.	Ita ce matsalar.
Please take the time to read it.	Da fatan za a ba da lokaci don karanta shi.
And of course they can't.	Kuma tabbas ba za su iya ba.
Of course I hear you.	Tabbas ina jin ku.
We can talk easily and call from boat to boat.	Za mu iya yin magana cikin sauƙi kuma mu kira daga jirgin ruwa zuwa jirgin ruwa.
They should be simple, yet they are beautiful.	Ya kamata su kasance masu sauƙi, duk da haka suna da kyau.
But it seems there has never been access.	Amma da alama ba a taɓa samun dama ba.
You will be what we hope from the beginning.	Za ku zama abin da muke fata tun daga farko.
You can't say no.	Ba za ku iya cewa a'a ba.
Went almost a week.	An tafi kusan mako guda.
It's scary.	Abu ne mai ban tsoro.
In fact she prefers it now.	A gaskiya ta fi son shi yanzu.
No one covered it.	Babu wanda ya rufe shi.
And you have to do it.	Kuma dole ne ku yi.
But, in a way, it is more than that.	Amma, a wata hanya, ya fi wannan.
He is not in the program.	Ba ya cikin shirin.
But somehow they did.	Amma ko ta yaya suka yi.
I'd rather sleep.	Gara in yi barci.
Not for everyone.	A'a ga kowa.
I do not know how.	Ban san yadda ba.
I want to know how it feels.	Ina so in san yadda yake ji.
Take care of children.	Kula da yara.
One child was removed because he died of an illness.	An cire yaro daya saboda ya mutu ba tare da rashin lafiya ba.
I hope people give us a chance.	Ina fata mutane su ba mu dama.
You know the past, you know the right and the wrong.	Kun san baya can, kun san abin da ke daidai da abin da ba daidai ba.
Then two things happened.	Sai abubuwa biyu suka faru.
I never told anyone that.	Ban taba gaya wa kowa wannan ba.
Don't talk like that.	Kar a yi magana haka.
He never.	Ya taba.
They did not expect that to happen.	Ba su yi tsammanin hakan zai faru ba.
If it weren't for you, it'd be someone else.	Idan ba kai ba, da wani ne.
Just not exactly fast.	Sai kawai ba daidai da sauri ba.
No this restaurant has never been tested.	A'a ba a taɓa gwada wannan gidan abincin ba.
It did me good.	Ya yi min kyau.
You will never have time.	Ba za ku taba samun lokaci ba.
They saw something wrong and corrected it.	Sun ga wani abu ba daidai ba sai suka gyara shi.
I stopped and looked.	Na tsaya na duba.
You did not write anything.	Ba ka rubuta komai ba.
We have nothing to sell.	Ba mu da abin da za mu sayar.
Just be careful.	Kawai a hankali.
They recognized him.	Sun gane shi.
It's time.	Lokaci ya yi.
If we don’t win, you won’t pay.	Idan ba mu ci nasara ba, ba za ku biya ba.
Others need to know this.	Sauran suna bukatar sanin wannan.
Some people ate fish.	Wasu mutane sun ci kifi.
And the joy of growing up with people.	Kuma farin cikin girma tare da mutane.
I will not take advantage of this opportunity.	Ba zan yi amfani da wannan damar ba.
This should not come as a surprise.	Wannan bai kamata ya zo da mamaki ba.
No one has ever.	Babu wanda ya taba.
And she knows how it will be otherwise.	Kuma ta san yadda zai kasance in ba haka ba.
He assumed he was doing exactly what was needed.	Ya dauka yana yin daidai abin da ake bukata.
Our only chance is to be ahead.	Damar mu kawai shine mu kasance gaba.
They do not know what to do.	Ba su san abin da za su yi ba.
After the movie is over, they are not ready to go to bed.	Bayan an gama fim ɗin, ba su shirya barci ba.
He has finished everything now.	Ya gama komai yanzu.
It's mine.	Nawa ne.
You do not need to do any of these things.	Ba a buƙatar ka yi ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan ba.
You want to put something in it.	Kuna son saka wani abu a ciki.
They apparently left the luggage in the car overnight.	Da alama sun bar kayan a cikin motar cikin dare.
He came back to her.	Ya dawo mata.
You should get it.	Ya kamata ku samu.
It is time to move on, 'he said.	Lokaci ya yi da za a ci gaba,' in ji shi.
You see she comes out, and she has no problem.	Ka ga ta fita, kuma ba ta da matsala.
The person who asked for help was late.	Mutumin da ya nemi taimako ya makara.
Dressed as usual.	Sanye yake kamar kullum.
The man was scared, but not me.	Mutumin ya ji tsoro, amma ba ni ba.
They too stopped.	Su ma suka tsaya.
We'll be back no.	Za mu dawo a'a.
Not really there.	Ba da gaske a wurin ba.
Breaking this is definitely a must.	Karya wannan tabbas yayi.
I just went out.	Na fita kawai.
It is not hard to lose.	Ba shi da wuya a rasa.
Not much, but something.	Ba yawa, amma wani abu.
She would not be happy if she heard this story.	Ba za ta ji daɗi ba idan ta ji wannan labarin.
He is honest.	Mai gaskiya ne.
Everything is useful.	Komai yana da amfani.
Why, why, why.	Me yasa, me yasa, me yasa.
At the time there was no one	A lokacin babu kowa
I went out for a morning walk.	Na fita don tafiya ta safe.
I will think about it.	Zan yi tunani game da shi.
You have to be the one to make things happen.	Dole ne ku zama wanda zai sa abubuwa su faru.
I try to make others happy with me.	Ina ƙoƙarin sa wasu su yi farin ciki tare da ni.
There were so many of us on the day.	Akwai mu da yawa a ranar.
She is still crying.	Har yanzu tana kuka.
I am not afraid of what will come at the end of life.	Bana tsoron abin da zai zo a karshen rayuwa.
They know you love them.	Sun san kuna son su.
He wants them to go.	Yana son su tafi.
You just can't lie to him.	Kai kawai ka kasa yi masa karya.
Keep thinking, you do not know.	Ci gaba da tunani, ba ku sani ba.
You should do everything you can.	Ya kamata ku yi duk abin da za ku iya.
Don’t just use it, you don’t need it.	Kada ku yi amfani da shi kawai, ba ku buƙatar shi.
He doesn’t care too much about things we don’t know.	Ba ya damu da yawa game da abubuwan da ba mu sani ba.
I will defend it.	Zan kare shi.
You can tell him the truth.	Kuna iya gaya masa gaskiya ne.
It should be a comfortable steering wheel by any means.	Ya kamata ya zama tuƙi mai daɗi ta kowace hanya.
Change the world.	Canza duniya.
That is not going to be a problem for me.	Wannan ba zai zama matsala a gare ni ba.
It's not just about her.	Ba game da ita kaɗai ba.
It was heard.	An ji shi.
They like it.	Sun so shi.
Everything is fine.	Komai na da kyau.
Sit back.	Zauna ya dawo.
But he was careful, all the same.	Amma ya kasance a hankali, duk daya.
Maybe or they won’t do the right thing.	Wataƙila ko ba za su yi daidai ba.
He wants to.	Ya so.
I do	ina yi
We all need it.	Mu duka muna bukata.
Living together.	Rayuwa tare.
You will know when it starts to feel right again.	Za ku san lokacin da ya fara jin daidai kuma.
We want you to have fun.	Muna son ku ji daɗi.
Nothing she did was right.	Ba abin da ta yi ya yi daidai.
But someone should.	Amma wani ya kamata.
They are careful.	Su ne a hankali.
It does not give you much time.	Ba ya ba ku lokaci mai yawa.
I made a mistake there.	Na yi kuskure a can.
The night began.	Daren ya fara.
No one ever thought that would happen.	Ba wanda ya taɓa tunanin hakan zai faru.
He gave me nothing.	Ba ya ba ni komai.
It’s not for me.	Ba abin da ke gare ni ba ne.
It just isn't.	Kawai ba haka bane.
I was never scared at all.	Ban taba jin tsoro ko kadan ba.
We are not used to them either.	Ba mu kuma saba da su ba.
Fun.	Abin dariya.
Interesting reading.	Karatu mai ban sha'awa.
No, not yet.	A'a, ba tukuna ba.
Money cannot buy.	Kudi ba zai iya saya ba.
Maybe there is a way to do this with more than one user.	Wataƙila akwai hanyar yin wannan fiye da ɗaya mai amfani.
And there is no need for it.	Kuma babu bukatar shi.
Stop for a moment.	Tsaya na ɗan lokaci.
Talk to your doctor about what is right for you.	Yi magana da likitan ku game da abin da ya dace a gare ku.
He fell asleep.	Ya fad'a a zaune.
Maybe it's too big.	Wataƙila yana da girma sosai.
No one can take this away from me.	Ba wanda zai iya ɗaukar wannan daga gare ni.
I have brought them to this day.	Na kawo su har zuwa yau.
Maybe one way or another.	Wataƙila wata hanya.
Please let me go.	Don Allah a bar ni in tafi.
They immediately left one by one.	Nan da nan suka bar daya bayan daya.
But things are.	Amma abubuwa ne.
We have to keep going.	Dole ne mu ci gaba.
Such a trip was never imagined.	Ba a yi tunanin irin wannan tafiya ba.
The same at night.	Haka kuma cikin dare.
Like you don't understand.	Kamar ba ku gane ba.
Let me get it now.	Bari in samu yanzu.
I lost someone here years ago.	Na rasa wani a nan shekaru da suka wuce.
Sorry about the water.	Yi hakuri game da ruwa.
She will never see anything now.	Ba za ta taɓa ganin komai ba a yanzu.
I think he was right.	Ina ganin yayi gaskiya.
It can help you.	Zai iya taimaka maka.
It's too hot.	Yayi zafi sosai.
I loved it there and decided to stay.	Ina son shi a can kuma na yanke shawarar zama.
And he made a mistake.	Kuma ya yi kuskure.
They protect your day.	Sun kare ranar ku.
They do well without it, however.	Suna yin kyau ba tare da shi ba, duk da haka.
I hope the night doesn’t end without my use.	Ina fatan dare bai kare ba tare da amfani da nawa ba.
There is no doubt about that.	Babu shakka game da hakan.
I will not put much money on it.	Ba zan sa kuɗi da yawa a kai ba.
He did not come with the equipment.	Bai zo da kayan aikin ba.
I started talking to her.	Na fara yi mata magana.
You must change this as soon as you can.	Dole ne ku canza wannan da sauri kamar yadda za ku iya.
However, we call it.	Duk da haka, mun kira shi.
He looks only one way.	Yana kallon hanya daya kawai.
You are about to be killed.	Ana shirin kashe ku.
Of course there is a utility.	Tabbas akwai mai amfani.
Kids say he loves me.	Yara suna cewa yana so na.
This is not your flight.	Wannan ba jirgin ku bane.
You should go to work.	Ya kamata ku je wurin aiki.
It really doesn’t look like anything.	A gaskiya ba kamar wani abu ba ne.
She can swim.	Ta iya yin iyo.
And that is sad.	Kuma wannan abin bakin ciki ne.
I was in it.	Na kasance a ciki.
I said let’s not just forget about it.	Na ce ba kawai mu manta game da shi ba.
Maybe even in the house.	Watakila ko a cikin gidan.
This is an amazing title.	Wannan take mai ban mamaki.
I can no longer fight.	Ba zan iya kara yin fada ba.
Something you won’t get a job out of.	Wani abu da ba za ku sami aiki daga ciki ba.
Not at all.	Ne ma.
You slept last night.	A daren jiya kun yi barci.
He would not do that.	Ba zai yi haka ba.
Above thirty.	Sama talatin.
I have been looking forward to it.	Na dade ina sa rai.
This is too much for people.	Wannan ya yi yawa ga mutane.
They do not want to be around you.	Ba sa son zama a kusa da ku.
I was worried about the road.	Na damu da hanya.
There is something else.	Akwai kuma wani abu kuma.
Things have changed.	Abubuwa sun canza.
Just do your job.	Yi aikin ku kawai.
He understood everything.	Ya fahimci komai.
No, he was not.	A'a, bai kasance ba.
If she appears at your place and she is.	Idan ta bayyana a wurin ku kuma tana.
It's one thing to experience it.	Zama daya ne ka samu.
You don't like the project.	Ba ku son aikin.
You know what school is like.	Kun san yadda makaranta take.
He would have stayed inside.	Da ya zauna a ciki.
But there is a problem.	Amma akwai matsala.
When we die we leave the earth.	Da mun mutu mun bar kasa.
How to live within yourselves.	Yadda ake zama a cikin kanku.
It was a funny night.	Dare ne mai ban dariya.
This is a surprise.	Wannan abin mamaki ne.
Last night.	A cikin daren da ya gabata.
We can do one this day.	Za mu iya yin daya a wannan rana.
One year like another year.	Shekara guda kamar wata shekara.
That too does not work.	Hakan ma baya aiki.
I know a lot about it, but it certainly isn't anything.	Na san abubuwa da yawa game da ita, amma tabbas ba komai ba ne.
And that is a good thing.	Kuma wannan shine kyakkyawan abu.
Now everyone has one.	Yanzu kowa yana da daya.
This last statement should not come as a surprise.	Wannan magana ta ƙarshe bai kamata ya zo da mamaki ba.
Or more than two.	Ko fiye da biyu.
Keep looking forward.	Ci gaba da duba gaba.
They are not here.	Ba su nan.
She would not want you to know that.	Ba za ta so ka san hakan ba.
Fear of the unknown.	Tsoron wanda ba a sani ba ne.
You can do this easily here.	Kuna iya yin wannan cikin sauƙi a nan.
Of course it will not go away until you are safe.	Tabbas ba za ta tafi ba har sai kun zauna lafiya.
She came alone, and that surprised me.	Ta zo ita kadai, kuma wannan ya ba ni mamaki.
Kids are next.	Yara ne gaba.
I love it more.	Na kara son shi.
But the game is almost never released.	Amma wasan ya yi kusa da ba a sake shi ba.
You have to travel fast, but you do not know where.	Dole ne ku yi tafiya da sauri, amma ba ku san inda ba.
But it can not be guaranteed.	Amma ba za a iya tabbata ba.
You will never grow up.	Ba za ku taɓa girma ba.
Probably not really back.	Wataƙila ba a dawo da gaske ba.
They make a mistake.	Suna min kuskure.
This is not a third world.	Wannan ba duniya ta uku ba ce.
They are.	Suna ne.
Maybe something from me.	Wataƙila wani abu daga gare ni.
He is not well enough to be at home.	Ba shi da lafiya sosai don ya kasance a gida.
Time is not money.	Lokaci ba kudi ba ne.
Suitable for three people easily.	Ya dace da mutane uku cikin sauƙi.
Not every day, though.	Ba a kowace rana ba, duk da haka.
This is just the first.	Wannan shine kawai na farko.
As he knew they would be.	Kamar yadda ya sani za su kasance.
They are killing us now.	Suna kashe mu yanzu.
And up front.	Kuma gaba da gaba.
I recommend not to find one.	Ina ba da shawarar kar a sami ɗaya.
But he could not walk fast.	Amma ya kasa tafiya da sauri.
I feel like a god.	Ina jin kamar allah.
There is no way around it.	Babu wata hanya a kusa da shi.
Make the most of the time we have.	Yi amfani da mafi kyawun lokacin da muke da shi.
Many died.	Mutane da yawa sun mutu.
Did you enjoy the day?	Shin kun ji daɗin rana?
I think it's over now.	Ina tsammanin ya gama yanzu.
Of course it is something.	Tabbas wani abu ne.
Not to take care of me.	Ba don ya kula da ni ba.
Probably not to be taken lightly.	Wataƙila ba za a ɗauka ba.
Time, that is the problem.	Lokaci, shine matsalar.
I wish her a good journey.	Ina fatan ta yi tafiya mai kyau.
Who will speak or die.	Wanda zai yi magana ko ya mutu.
I was very happy with the purchase.	Na yi matukar farin ciki da siyan.
What he did was not complete.	Abin da ya yi bai cika ba.
We like to play there.	Muna son yin wasa a can.
I don't know if I will accept it.	Ban san ko zan yarda da ita ba.
I called it heaven.	Na kira shi sama.
It's an amazing thing.	Abu ne mai ban mamaki.
Uncertainty filled her.	Rashin tabbas ya cika mata.
It’s not just done.	Ba a yi shi kawai ba.
I know what about this game.	Na san abin da game da wannan game.
I think this method will work.	Ina tsammanin wannan hanyar za ta yi aiki.
And just water.	Kuma kawai ruwa.
It was not very cold, before the cold season came.	Bai yi sanyi sosai ba, kafin lokacin sanyi ya zo.
You will not be alone.	Ba za ku kasance kadai ba.
However, she did not accept them.	Duk da haka, ba ta yarda da su ba.
And they were probably very happy.	Kuma watakila sun yi farin ciki sosai.
They will never be able to fix it.	Ba za su taɓa iya gyara shi ba.
So she ran.	Don haka ta gudu.
The first payment cannot be made until next month.	Ba za a iya biya na farko ba har sai wata mai zuwa.
It took years to get this right.	Na ɗauki shekaru don samun wannan daidai.
To join them.	Don shiga su.
He wants her to suffer.	Yana son ta sha wahala.
I want to hear the rest.	Ina so in ji sauran.
I went home and smoked.	Na shiga gida na sha taba.
It may not be clear, however, what he did.	Wataƙila ba a bayyana ba, duk da haka, abin da ya yi.
Ko nan ma.	Ko nan ma.
He does not want to die.	Ba ya son ya mutu.
How true.	Yaya gaskiya ne.
be right back	ina zuwa
Or seeing someone completely.	Ko ganin wani gaba daya.
Not long ago.	Ban dade ba.
Not us, of course.	Ba mu, ba shakka.
As usual.	Kamar yadda muka saba.
Almost like sleeping at home.	Kusan kamar barci a gida.
There is no way to open it from within.	Babu hanyar bude shi daga ciki.
Let's call it a day.	Bari mu kira shi a rana.
I got up.	Na tashi.
A simple mistake.	Kuskure mai sauƙi.
However, I do not know why it worked.	Duk da haka, ban san dalilin da ya sa ya yi aiki ba.
But that was the last thing she was worried about.	Amma wannan shi ne abu na ƙarshe da ta damu.
I feel unhappy in the world.	Ina jin rashin jin daɗi a duniya.
Like she knew something.	Kamar ta san wani abu.
Traveling is difficult.	Tafiya tana da wahala.
All things never seen before.	Duk abubuwan da ba a taɓa gani ba.
We too have to apologize.	Mu ma mu yi hakuri.
In this way, please.	Ta wannan hanyar, don Allah.
I hope so.	Ina fatan haka.
He did not speak.	Bai yi magana ba.
Other than that, there is no visible sign.	Ban da wannan, babu wata alama da za a iya gani.
Not you.	Ba ku.
Sit there.	Zauna can.
And, you made a mistake.	Kuma, kun yi kuskure.
Then she spoke.	Sai ta yi magana.
It's very difficult.	Yana da wuya sosai.
It also looked like a mistake.	Ya kuma yi kama da kuskure.
This has to prove itself.	Wannan dole ya tabbatar da kansa.
Take care of everyone.	A kula kowa.
But nothing happened.	Amma babu abin da ya faru.
Surprisingly you checked to see if there were any more.	Abin mamaki da ka duba don ganin ko akwai kuma.
More like the known.	Fiye kamar wanda aka sani.
You can get people to give you more money.	Kuna iya samun mutane su ba ku ƙarin kuɗi.
You are a great person.	Kai babban mutum ne.
That's the best song ever sung.	Shi ke nan aka yi waƙa mafi kyau.
Many things have happened.	Abubuwa da yawa sun faru.
Which is definitely what people think.	Wanda tabbas shine abin da mutane suke tunani.
They want to know when it started.	Suna so su san lokacin da ya fara.
He arrived on time and got the right job.	Ya isa akan lokaci kuma ya samu daidai aiki.
When it passes, it passes.	Lokacin da ya wuce, ya wuce.
Just looking at the place.	Kallon wuri kawai.
In fact, do not hesitate to try them out.	A gaskiya, kada ku damu gwada su.
And there is no future, there is only time.	Kuma babu wani lokaci na gaba, akwai lokaci kawai.
No one has ever caught that.	Babu wanda ya taba kama haka.
You did them.	Kun yi su.
Speech did not come easily either.	Magana ma ba ta zo da sauƙi ba.
This is the easiest for me.	Wannan shi ne mafi sauƙi a gare ni.
I will not wait any longer.	Ba zan ƙara jira ba.
I will do it all for myself.	Zan yi wa kaina duka.
Of course they did.	Tabbas sun yi.
I'm looking for a good one.	Ina neman wannan mai kyau.
You have to work with it for a while.	Dole ne ku yi aiki da shi a ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
I can help.	Zan iya taimaka.
But they are there.	Amma suna can.
Wherever you want.	Duk inda kuke so.
I'm just tired.	Na gaji ne kawai.
He wouldn’t mind me.	Ba zai damu da ni ba.
So last year.	Don haka shekara ta wuce.
These accessories are a great highlight of our celebration.	Waɗannan kayan aikin su ne babban abin da ke nuna bikin mu.
I didn't try this last night.	Ban gwada wannan daren jiya ba.
We were really into it.	Mun kasance a ciki sosai.
No one has yet commented.	Har yanzu babu wanda ya bayyana.
What a waste of time and money.	Abin da bata lokaci da kudi.
They added a loss in one game.	Sun kara rashin nasara a wasa daya.
We are not talking about others.	Ba mu magana game da wasu.
It was quick for a man, but not enough.	Ya kasance mai sauri ga mutum, amma bai isa ba.
Of course not for everyone.	Tabbas ba na kowa bane.
Stop here.	Ku tsaya a nan.
I don't think you should know.	Bana jin ya kamata ka sani.
No one likes a new person anyway.	Babu wanda ke son sabon mutumin ta wata hanya.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
He was quick to tell.	Ya yi sauri a gaya.
He made sure he ate right.	Ya tabbatar yana cin abinci daidai.
From the two of you.	Daga ku biyu.
So, we'll see.	Don haka, za mu gani.
And it's hard to stop.	Kuma da wuya a daina.
Only after three.	Sai bayan uku.
After everything was ready, it was time to leave.	Bayan an shirya komai, lokaci ya yi da za a tafi.
We will be safe.	Za mu kasance lafiya.
The first thing he did was change the oil.	Abu na farko da ya yi shi ne canza mai.
No more incidents.	Babu sauran abubuwan da suka faru.
I think it is wrong.	Ina ganin ba daidai ba.
It's good.	Yana da kyau.
In or out.	Shiga ko fita.
I felt like a new person.	Na ji kamar sabon mutum.
She immediately stopped walking.	Nan take ta daina tafiya.
Both together does not work.	Duka tare ba ya aiki.
I beg to differ.	Ban yarda ba.
They took me to continue the work.	Sun tafi da ni don ci gaba da aikin.
Something similar is happening.	Irin wannan abu yana faruwa.
So, let them come.	Don haka, bari su zo.
Nothing says you must read them.	Babu wani abu da ya ce dole ne ku karanta su.
I can't say for sure.	Ba zan iya cewa tabbas ba.
Is there a time when everything is right?	Shin akwai lokacin da komai yayi daidai?
She also arrested him.	Ita ma ta kama shi.
It goes slowly, but eventually the road is clear.	Yana tafiya a hankali, amma a ƙarshe hanya ta bayyana.
Fix everything.	A gyara komai.
This is the essence of it.	Wannan shi ne ainihin shi.
She is beautiful.	Tana da kyau.
There is no way.	Babu wata hanya.
It’s right here like you.	Yana da dama a nan kamar ku.
But that is not the case.	Amma shi ba haka yake ba.
This is what you need to know.	Abin da kuke buƙatar sani ke nan.
Take it.	Ka dauka.
That made him uncomfortable.	Hakan yasa shi rashin jin dadi.
It felt like we had been working together for years.	Ya ji kamar muna aiki tare tsawon shekaru.
He wondered if it was true.	Yayi tunanin ko gaskiya ne.
But overall, after all, humans are human beings.	Amma gaba ɗaya, bayan haka, mutane mutane ne.
I, perhaps more than anyone, know how much she loves him.	Ni, watakila fiye da kowa, na san yadda take son shi.
Then he thought.	Sai ya yi tunani.
We let this happen.	Mun bar wannan ya faru.
This surprised them.	Wannan ya ba su mamaki.
I am very happy we did.	Na yi matukar farin ciki da muka yi.
The sun came out, looking up.	Rana ta fito, ta kalli sama.
I am the best.	Ni mafi duka.
We don't like them.	Ba mu son su.
He enjoyed life with uncertainty.	Ya ji daɗin rayuwa tare da rashin tabbas.
Someone wanted her.	Wani ya so ta.
But one can see.	Amma wanda zai iya gani.
Even then, we must decide to do something about it.	Har ma a lokacin, dole ne mu yanke shawarar yin wani abu game da shi.
He was.	Ya kasance.
But you are right.	Amma kun yi daidai.
So he did nothing.	Don haka bai yi komai ba.
But it hurts so much to think positively.	Amma ya ji zafi sosai don ya yi tunani mai kyau.
I want to touch them.	Ina so in taba su.
He really liked me, you know.	Ya so ni da gaske, ka sani.
Work together or alone, but work well.	Yi aiki tare ko kadai, amma aiki da kyau.
We live in peace together.	Muna zaune lafiya tare.
You are safe, and if you are not, you bring it to yourself.	Kuna lafiya, kuma idan ba ku, kun kawo wa kanku.
They were always eating or having lunch.	Sun kasance kullum suna cin abinci ko abincin rana.
She entered later, after the man had left.	Ta shiga daga baya, bayan mutumin ya fita.
I can't say anything.	Ba zan iya cewa komai ba.
He never wrote it down, though.	Bai taba rubuta shi ba, ko da yake.
We think he can do that.	Muna tsammanin zai iya yin hakan.
Nothing came out.	Babu wani abu da ya fito.
Turn off the heat.	Kashe zafi.
The dog has that.	Kare yana da wannan.
This is not a cold dog.	Wannan ba kare mai sanyi ba ne.
It will look great, though.	Zai yi kyau sosai, ko da yake.
Maybe it would be better.	Wataƙila zai yi kyau.
Maybe you left your house.	Wataƙila kun fita daga gidan ku.
I don't want to do that again.	Ba na son yin wannan kuma.
Let them know immediately.	Bari su sani nan da nan.
That's what you get.	Abin da kuke samu ke nan.
Did she do it.	Shin ta yi shi.
I wonder so.	Ina mamakin haka.
Remember to bring dog food.	Ka tuna ka kawo abincin dare na kare.
As you.	Kamar yadda kuke.
It's cold.	Akwai sanyi.
I'll just go out.	Zan fita kawai.
There is still more to be done.	Har yanzu akwai sauran abubuwa da za a yi.
But there is more to be done.	Amma akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a yi.
I love women	Ina son mata
I did not take your job.	Ban dauki aikin ku ba.
They could not see it in the future.	Ba su iya ganin haka a gaba.
We cannot change these.	Ba za mu iya canza waɗannan ba.
He is looking for money.	Yana neman kudi.
This is the time to put yourself first.	Wannan shine lokacin da za ku saka kanku a gaba.
Write about it.	Rubuta game da shi.
He once tried to be a good helper.	Ya taɓa ƙoƙarin zama mai taimako da kyau.
She is growing up now.	Ta girma yanzu.
Looking where it will never be.	Kallon inda ba zata taba zama ba.
Everything worked as expected.	Komai yayi aiki kamar yadda aka zata.
So should you.	Haka ya kamata ku.
The story is good.	Labarin yana da kyau.
Time is everything you have.	Lokacin shine duk abin da kuke da shi.
I do not like it.	Ba na son shi.
It's just nowhere near beautiful.	Yana da kawai babu inda kusa da kyau.
Nothing, she said, nothing.	Ba komai, ta ce, ba komai.
You will if you are there.	Za ku yi idan kuna can.
Because that doesn't work.	Saboda wannan ba ya aiki.
Now, let's go inside and see what we can get.	Yanzu, bari mu shiga ciki mu ga abin da za mu iya samu.
You are not allowed to touch this.	Ba a yarda ku taɓa wannan ba.
I think it can kill me.	Ina tsammanin zai iya kashe ni.
The sky has never been made up.	Ba a taɓa yin sama ba.
Doubt seized him.	Shakka ya kama shi.
We got ready and left.	Muka shirya muka tafi.
He took a lot of money.	Ya tafi da kud'i masu yawa.
After that only once a week.	Bayan haka sau ɗaya kawai a mako.
Work began next year.	An fara aiki a shekara mai zuwa.
But no one is here.	Amma babu kowa a nan.
This wet suit is awesome.	Wannan rigar rigar tana da ban tsoro.
Which is true anyway.	Wanda ya kasance gaskiya ta wata hanya.
He prepared as best he could.	Ya shirya yadda ya iya.
Do what you want!	Yi abin da kuke so!
Is this a human being?	Wannan ma mutum ne?.
I couldn’t help but wonder what she knew.	Ba zan iya ba sai mamakin abin da ta sani.
Players can enter or leave at any time.	'Yan wasa za su iya shiga ko fita a kowane lokaci.
Water is necessary to maintain life.	Ruwa ya zama dole don kula da rayuwa.
I think it proves that people have not forgotten it.	Ina tsammanin yana tabbatar da cewa mutane ba su manta da shi ba.
Or, if he did, he did nothing about it.	Ko kuma, idan ya yi, bai yi komai a kai ba.
So we would go home and ask him.	Don haka za mu je gida mu tambaye shi.
A good way to start this great game.	Kyakkyawan hanya don fara wannan babban wasan.
It will not change.	Ba zai canza ba.
No one.	Babu kowa.
And he was right.	Kuma da ya yi gaskiya.
Illness is all about life.	Rashin lafiya shine game da rayuwa.
He did not publish it.	Bai buga shi ba.
And the work continued.	Kuma aikin ya ci gaba.
But then we made things interesting.	Amma sai muka sanya abubuwa su zama masu ban sha'awa.
I am very excited about this game.	Ina jin dadi sosai game da wannan wasan.
So no one will remember it.	Don haka babu wanda zai tuna da shi.
Correction is exactly what it is.	Gyara shine daidai abin da yake.
The program was there.	Shirin ya kasance a wurin.
That she can.	Cewa zata iya.
He talked to girls like me in the past.	Ya yi magana da 'yan mata kamar ni a baya.
Occurs when they are not in use.	Yana faruwa lokacin da ba a yi amfani da su ba.
I don’t know if tomorrow we will.	Ban sani ba ko gobe za mu yi.
It shouldn’t be too much.	Bai kamata ya yi yawa ba.
I will never let it happen.	Ba zan taba bari ta faru ba.
I waited for them.	Na jira su.
Don't tell me.	Kar ku gaya mani.
He was amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
Just thinking.	Tunani kawai.
Go back and read them.	Koma ka karanta su.
Maybe we came early in the year.	Wataƙila mun zo da wuri a cikin shekara.
You just don't know yet.	Kai ne kawai ba ku sani ba tukuna.
And only when things happen.	Kuma kawai lokacin da abubuwa ke faruwa.
You know what.	Kun san menene.
People will get hurt, maybe even die.	Mutane za su ji rauni, watakila su mutu.
Speak! 	Yi magana!
Really amazing.	Da gaske ban mamaki.
So few people know him.	Don haka mutane kaɗan ne suka san shi.
That may surprise some.	Hakan na iya zama abin mamaki ga wasu.
There is also coffee.	Akwai kuma kofi.
Slightly weak.	Dan rauni da kyau.
They know who they are.	Sun san wanda suke ƙi.
I decided to keep eating.	Na yanke shawarar ci gaba da cin abinci.
There is no time to do that.	Babu lokacin yin hakan.
I was very cold, just like you.	Na yi sanyi sosai, kamar ku.
I want something to take care of.	Ina son abin da zan kula.
It's not mine.	Ba nawa ba ne.
I asked him once why he needed to recognize himself.	Na tambaye shi sau ɗaya dalilin da yasa yake buƙatar gane kansa.
I do not know how this will be.	Ban san yadda wannan zai kasance ba.
I do not know what she is talking about.	Ban san me take magana ba na ce haka.
I hope this will tell me.	Ina fatan wannan zai ce da ni.
I really like it.	Ina matukar son shi.
Good man.	Mutumin mai kyau.
He knows about it.	Ya sani game da shi.
Unlike us today.	Ba kamar mu a yau ba.
Everyone will look like this time.	Kowa zai yi kama da wannan lokacin.
You feel so right.	Kun ji haka daidai.
It's just fun, real fun.	Abin farin ciki ne kawai, jin daɗi na gaske.
They have never been so.	Ba su taɓa zama har yanzu haka ba.
In the end, everyone is there.	A ƙarshe, kowa yana wurin.
Close to crying.	Kusa da kuka.
Scary though.	Abin ban tsoro ko da yake.
However, this proved to be difficult to do.	Duk da haka, wannan ya tabbatar da wuya a yi.
I'm sure you miss something.	Na tabbata kuna rasa wani abu.
I'm sure you will realize this one day.	Na tabbata za ku gane wa kanku wannan wata rana.
Life is Beautiful.	Rai na da kyau.
Anything can happen at any time.	Komai na iya faruwa a kowane lokaci.
I do not remember that name.	Ban tuna wannan sunan ba.
He started telling me what happened that day.	Ya fara ba ni labarin abin da ya faru a ranar.
I don't think she likes it.	Bana jin tana son shi.
It is summer.	Lokacin zafi ne.
We even recommend putting them on the runway.	Har ma muna ba da shawarar saka su a kan hanyar gudu.
I don't care anyway.	Ban damu ba ko ta yaya.
I will not give her anything.	Ba zan ba ta komai ba.
We need to talk a lot.	Muna bukatar magana sosai.
I want to reach everyone.	Ina so in isa ga kowa.
If you do not come out.	Idan baka fito ba.
In this way, the work progresses faster.	Ta wannan hanyar, aikin yana ci gaba da sauri.
There is no time to do anything about it.	Babu lokacin yin komai game da shi.
He will give you every help.	Zai ba ku kowane taimako.
That's interesting.	Abin sha'awa kenan.
What is happening in the world?	Me ke faruwa a duniya?.
Soon you will.	Nan da nan za ku.
He made me laugh!	Ya bani dariya!.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
Of course I would say that again.	Tabbas zan sake cewa.
And just you.	Kuma ku kawai.
Work at home.	Yi aiki a gida.
Delicious food was provided.	An ba da abinci mai daɗi.
We see, you see.	Mun gani, kun gani.
Let's see what we think.	Bari mu ga abin da muke tunani.
Obviously something is wrong.	Babu shakka wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
This dog will not be allowed to go out.	Ba za a bar wannan kare ya fita ba.
But, you can see that he did not.	Amma, za ka ga cewa bai yi ba.
None of it.	Babu ko ɗaya daga ciki.
You do not sleep when someone is driving.	Ba ka barci lokacin da wani ke tuƙi.
I feel she doesn't care what we think.	Ina jin ba ta damu da abin da muke tunani ba.
I will answer.	Zan amsa.
That's how you do the players.	Haka kuke yin yan wasa.
You do not know what you are doing by keeping me here.	Ba ku san abin da kuke yi ba ta wurin ajiye ni a nan.
The coffee is hot and sweet.	Kofi ya yi zafi da daɗi.
That may not be true.	Wataƙila hakan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Find two similar foods.	Gano abinci guda biyu masu kama da juna.
But we did not fall on our knees.	Amma ba mu yi kasa a gwiwa ba.
So maybe that's what happened.	Don haka watakila abin da ya faru ke nan.
You know, you are very tired.	Ka sani, kun gaji sosai.
And because he was still.	Kuma saboda ya kasance har yanzu.
I really live.	Ina rayuwa da gaske.
They wanted to play it.	Sun so su yi wasa da shi.
Like he heard something.	Kamar ya ji wani abu.
But money has been a problem.	Amma kudi ya kasance matsala.
What she saw filled her.	Abin da ta gani ya cika ta.
I do not need anything.	Bana bukatar komai.
It must not work.	Dole ne kada yayi aiki.
They are not the same.	Ba daya bane.
And it is your favorite.	Kuma shi ne kuka fi so.
Maybe too many.	Wataƙila sun yi yawa.
Many did.	Mutane da yawa sun yi hakan.
They will always be.	Za su kasance a koyaushe.
They look that way.	Suna kallon haka.
Now he does not care.	Yanzu bai damu ba.
Everyone wants something from him.	Kowa ya so wani abu daga gare shi.
I can’t wait to be the last.	Ba zan iya jira in zama na ƙarshe ba.
I have to leave this house for a while.	Dole ne in fita daga gidan nan na ɗan lokaci.
And they touched you.	Kuma sun taba ku.
But, we did not.	Amma, ba mu yi ba.
Some do not take it.	Wasu ba sa ɗauka.
You need to get up.	Kuna buƙatar tashi.
And you never make a mistake.	Kuma ba ka taba yin kuskure ba.
He could not take it for long.	Ya kasa ɗauka na tsawon lokaci.
Please help her.	Don Allah a taimaka mata.
But it should.	Amma ya kamata.
It seemed like a must.	Ya zama kamar dole ne.
I learned that.	Na koyi hakan.
Yet there is no problem.	Amma duk da haka babu matsala.
I did not think it was right.	Ban yi tsammanin daidai ba ne.
I was happy and excited.	Na yi farin ciki da jin daɗi.
I have no plans to do so.	Ban shirya yin haka ba.
Now, let's make sure.	Yanzu, bari mu tabbatar .
It happens fast, but it can be scary.	Yana faruwa da sauri, amma yana iya zama mai ban tsoro.
I am leaving this restaurant.	Ina barin wannan gidan abincin.
I can not even speak.	Ba zan iya ko magana ba.
We looked back.	Mun duba a baya.
From there.	Daga can.
I'll give you that.	Zan baka haka.
Very interesting.	Abin sha'awa sosai.
There is a door.	Akwai kofar.
One has to try to stick with the first one.	Dole ne mutum yayi ƙoƙari ya tsaya tare da na farko.
That must be difficult.	Dole ne hakan yayi wahala.
She thinks something is wrong.	Tana tunanin wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
I always thought that was funny.	A koyaushe ina tsammanin hakan abin ban dariya ne.
You need to log in	Kuna buƙatar shiga
Something has always been the case.	Wani abu ya kasance koyaushe.
Such a mistake should be difficult, but it is easy to correct.	Irin wannan kuskure ya kamata ya zama mai wuya, amma yana da sauƙi a gyara.
I was very surprised.	Na yi mamaki sosai.
He will be back tomorrow.	Gobe ​​zai dawo.
I do not understand what is going on.	Ban gane me ke faruwa ba.
I never thought it would be you.	Ban taba tunanin zai zama ku ba.
I know what you are doing.	Na san abin da kuke yi.
We have a good idea of ​​how many people were killed.	Muna da kyakkyawan tunani nawa aka kashe mutane.
In the second, you can.	A cikin na biyu, kuna iya.
How she knew she did not know.	Yadda ta san ba ta sani ba.
You have to accept that.	Dole ne ku yarda da hakan.
She has no idea what she is up to.	Bata san me take ciki ba.
He is very happy to know you.	Ya yi matukar farin ciki sanin ku.
The world is coming to an end.	Duniya ta zo ƙarshe.
I see no error.	Ban ga kuskure ba.
There she is.	Can tana nan.
They came close though.	Sun zo kusa ko da yake.
You feel at home.	Ka ji kamar kana gida.
So I tried that.	Don haka na gwada hakan.
Of course not.	Tabbas ba zai iya ba.
This is nothing new for the moment.	Wannan ba sabon abu ba ne don lokacin.
They really don't.	Da gaske ba sa yi.
Or, to be able to see if someone is there.	Ko, don su iya ganin ko wani mutum yana wurin.
But still not sure.	Amma duk da haka bai tabbata ba.
Another setback.	Wani koma baya.
I do not know this man.	Ban san wannan mutumin ba.
We will not forget you.	Ba za mu manta da ku ba.
She thought of me.	Ta yi min tunanin.
She felt that way.	Ta ji haka.
And they are always there for each other.	Kuma kullum suna nan da juna.
This is one of the others.	Wannan daya ne daga cikin sauran.
We got along well.	Mun samu lafiya tare.
I think he probably never came.	Ina tsammanin watakila bai taba zuwa ba.
It feels right.	Yana jin daidai.
You must try it.	Dole ne ku gwada shi.
Add more preferences.	Ƙara ƙarin yadda ake so.
Things started this weekend.	Abubuwan sun fara wannan karshen mako.
The water is not suitable for drinking.	Ruwan bai dace da sha ba.
I completely forgot.	Na manta gaba daya.
She is often nervous.	Sau da yawa tana jin tsoro.
The first is to start talking.	Na farko shine ya fara magana.
Not again.	Bai sake ba.
We started eating.	Muka fara ci.
Please tell me now.	Don Allah a gaya mani yanzu.
Just himself.	Shi kansa kawai.
He opened the door laughing.	Ya bude kofar yana dariya.
Which is.	Wanda shine.
There is no easy way to get what you really want.	Babu wata hanya mai sauƙi don samun abin da kuke so da gaske.
It started to rain a little.	An fara ruwan sama kadan.
The end has come.	An kai ga ƙarshe.
There is something else happening here.	Akwai wani abu kuma da ke faruwa a nan.
She passed up.	Ta wuce sama.
However there is a lot of growth.	Duk da haka akwai girma da yawa.
He was at that time.	Ya kasance a wannan lokacin.
I am a big man.	Ni babban mutum ne.
Sometimes only two.	Wani lokaci biyu kawai.
Let's meet there.	Mu hadu a can.
This feels familiar.	Wannan yana jin saba.
They sit and wait to be called.	Suna zaune suna jiran a kira su.
He did.	Haka ya yi.
I tell you something though.	Ina gaya muku wani abu ko da yake.
That started it here.	Hakan ya fara shi a nan.
I have been in it for a long time.	Na dade a ciki.
He says it was a success.	Ya ce an yi nasara.
I will never see you again.	Ba zan ƙara gani ba.
It is not something you can buy.	Ba abu ne da za ku iya saya ba.
Now we know we are right.	Yanzu mun san mun yi gaskiya.
Do you do this yourself? 	Kuna yin wannan da kanku?
I think there is something you want from me.	Ina tsammanin akwai wani abu da kuke so daga gare ni.

Make it that way.	Sanya shi haka.
Also many do not fall to their knees.	Haka kuma da yawa ba su yi kasa a gwiwa ba.
Every night sometimes.	Duk dare wani lokacin.
It was very difficult for me to do it.	Yana da matukar wahala a gare ni in yi shi.
This is not her.	Wannan ba ita ce ta ba.
Do not tell other people again.	Kar a sake gaya wa wasu mutane.
But that will be in the future.	Amma hakan ya kasance a nan gaba.
It really isn’t home.	Da gaske ba gida ba ne.
Maybe they did the rest of us.	Wataƙila sun yi wa sauran mu.
This is correct.	Wannan shi ne daidai.
I did not let anything pass me by.	Ban bar komai ya wuce ni ba.
I suggest you try bus travel.	Ina ba da shawarar ku gwada tafiya ta bas.
Everyone agrees.	Kowa ya yarda da haka.
Certainly I did not look at myself with any kind of common sense.	Lallai ni ban kalli kaina da wani irin na kowa ba.
It rained again at night.	An sake yin ruwan sama a daren.
I got up again before the sun came up.	Na sake tashi kafin rana ta fito.
And it is not.	Kuma ba haka ba.
She is very patient with him.	Ta bashi hakuri sosai.
Maybe a little earlier.	Watakila kadan a baya.
As she could see at night.	Kamar yadda ta iya gani a daren.
Then all they need is lunch.	Sai kuma wanda suke bukata shine a abincin rana.
I can do this.	Zan iya yin wannan.
Didn't you say?	Ba ka ce ba?
But we did not give up.	Amma ba mu daina ba.
She will send, if they will hear.	Za ta aika, idan za su ji.
So far, no answer.	Ya zuwa yanzu, babu amsa.
It made her hotter.	Ya kara mata zafi.
I think everyone is just fine.	Ina tsammanin kowa yana da kyau kawai.
Please let me know that they have never done this to children.	Don Allah a gaya mani cewa ba su taɓa yi wa yara haka ba.
We did not tell them what happened in the past.	Ba mu ba su labarin abin da ya faru a baya.
I know what you think.	Na san abin da kuke tunani.
That did not work well.	Hakan bai yi kyau ba.
I have never seen her do that to anyone.	Ban taba ganin ta yi haka da wani ba.
I took the job.	Na dauki aikin.
Let's go there.	Mu je can.
So we need everyone.	Don haka muna bukatar kowa.
That you ask me.	Da ka tambaye ni.
I hope it will not rain tomorrow.	Ina fatan ba za a yi ruwan sama ba gobe.
We need to have a great year.	Muna bukatar ya yi babban shekara.
I will tell you what you want to know.	Zan gaya muku abin da kuke son sani.
Had he taken me twice without him.	Da ya kai ni sau biyu ba tare da shi ba.
Flee.	Gudu.
I cried twice.	Na yi kuka sau biyu.
It's still nothing.	Har yanzu bata ce komai ba.
Talking about the past is hard.	Magana a kan abubuwan da suka gabata yana da wuya.
Everything was there.	Komai ya kasance a wurin.
I drank water.	Na sha ruwa.
It's too late.	Ya makara.
I am leaving in about a week.	Zan tafi kamar mako guda.
So far it is not gone.	Ya zuwa yanzu ba a tafi ba.
She's gone through all of that now.	Ta wuce duk wannan yanzu.
No one came out.	Babu wanda ya fito.
It came like this.	Ya zo kamar haka.
However no error was made apparent.	Duk da haka ba a sanya kuskure ya bayyana ba.
No one ever knew for sure.	Babu wanda ya taɓa sanin tabbas.
The task was not easy.	Aikin bai kasance mai sauƙi ba.
This is mine.	Wannan nawa ne.
I read a lot.	Ina karatu da yawa.
I go a few and it gets easier.	Ina zuwa wasu kaɗan kuma yana samun sauƙi.
I didn’t expect anyone to rush.	Ban yi tsammanin kowa zai yi sauri ba.
I'm not too worried.	Ban damu ba sosai.
It's close.	Yana kusa.
Many people are not like that.	Mutane da yawa ba haka bane.
Maybe she too.	Watakila ita ma.
It is not a good thing to kill someone.	Ba abin farin ciki ba ne a kashe wani.
But sometimes, it is enough.	Amma wani lokacin, ya isa.
Let's wait and see.	Mu jira mu gani.
After all, he was just a kid.	Bayan haka, yaro ne kawai.
So far, he has been feeling well.	Ya zuwa yanzu, yana jin dadi.
It will not be easy.	Ba zai kasance da sauƙi ba.
Since then he has not flown again.	Tun daga wannan lokacin bai sake tashi ba.
Nothing should.	Babu abin da ya kamata.
I saw what you saw, and we both saw a lot of way.	Na ga abin da kuka gani, kuma mu biyu mun ga hanya da yawa.
Let's get out now.	Mu fita yanzu.
No problem to this day.	Babu matsala har yau.
But he did not just talk.	Amma bai yi magana kawai ba.
He left it to you.	Ya bar muku shi.
Through the main door they entered.	Ta babban kofar suka shiga.
You know there is no way.	Ka san babu wata hanya.
The man stopped walking.	Mutumin ya daina tafiya.
And let me tell you something.	Kuma bari in gaya muku wani abu.
Today it is hot.	Yau yayi zafi.
Children are in trouble when they grow up.	Yara suna cikin matsala idan sun girma.
Only once.	Lokaci guda kawai.
A real home from home.	Gida na gaske daga gida.
But let's start drinking.	Amma bari mu fara sha.
It's not a road, it's a place.	Ba hanya ba ce, wurin ne.
This is from childhood.	Wannan daga yara ne.
That will be my reality next year.	Wannan zai zama gaskiya na a shekara mai zuwa.
Second whatever you say.	Na biyu duk abin da ka ce.
Work is fast.	Aiki yana da sauri.
Take care now, it hurts.	A kula yanzu, yayi zafi.
Think this can be useful for you and you get it.	Yi tunanin wannan zai iya zama da amfani a gare ku kuma ku samu.
They stayed there for three days.	Nan suka zauna kwana uku.
She is not afraid.	Bata ji tsoro ba.
How can I fix this.	Ta yaya zan iya gyara wannan.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.	Ina fatan kun ji daɗin zuwa da kuka yi min.
But he thought more.	Amma ya fi tunanin hakan.
You are more than that.	Kun fi haka.
He did not disappoint her.	Bai bata mata rai ba.
He does not like you.	Ba ya son ku.
She will be fine now.	Zata samu lafiya yanzu.
What do you say we give him sometimes.	Me ka ce mu ba shi wani lokaci.
This is how fear works.	Wannan shine yadda tsoro ke aiki.
The room seems to be hot.	Dakin kamar yayi zafi.
Look like this.	Kalli kamar haka.
No one recognized her.	Babu wanda ya gane ta.
But it did not correct my vision.	Amma bai gyara gani na ba.
She was so.	Ta kasance haka.
The night is coming, now.	Dare yana zuwa, yanzu.
Actually, no, forget that.	A gaskiya, a'a, manta da haka.
He is walking.	Yana tafiya.
I am not afraid !.	Ba tsoro na!.
She could not run.	Ta kasa gudu.
Don't worry so much.	Kar ku damu haka.
I am just a human being.	Ni mutum ne kawai.
They are all dead now.	Duk sun mutu yanzu.
Using them is the most difficult.	Yin amfani da su ne ya fi wahala.
I think we can all agree on that.	Ina ganin duk za mu iya yarda da hakan.
This must be stopped!	Wannan dole ne a daina!
He does not say that both must be true.	Ba ya ce dole ne duka biyu su zama gaskiya.
So far it is good, and they fit very well.	Ya zuwa yanzu yana da kyau, kuma sun dace sosai.
People help each other, they work with each other.	Mutane suna taimakon juna, suna aiki da juna.
I continue to lose people.	Na ci gaba da rasa mutane.
Now the problem is fixed please try again.	Yanzu an gyara matsalar don Allah a gwada.
We did really well.	Mun yi kyau sosai.
They do not think.	Ba sa tunani.
Not a good read.	Ba karatu mai kyau ba.
With it, he must have been fine.	Da shi, tabbas ya kasance lafiya.
I definitely spent more time with them.	Lallai na kara lokaci tare da su.
He went to study.	Ya je ya yi karatu.
Dinner came quickly.	Abincin dare ya zo da sauri.
Remember it too.	Ka tuna shi ma.
What a joy.	Yaya abin farin ciki ne.
No one will ever give me a job again.	Ba wanda zai sake ba ni aiki.
You can print it from there.	Kuna iya buga shi daga can.
This can be interesting.	Wannan na iya samun ban sha'awa.
So, you really know them.	Don haka, da gaske kun san su.
But it was too late.	Amma nan take ya makara.
But nothing seems to be working.	Amma da alama babu abin da ke aiki.
Tell me where to look.	Fada mani inda zan duba.
Or so the story goes.	Ko haka labarin ya tafi.
Here are some of them:	Ga su kamar yadda yake so.
Maybe he was talking to you.	Wataƙila yana magana da ku.
He told us to come and eat with him.	Ya ce mu zo can mu ci abinci tare da shi.
They are good people.	Mutane ne masu kyau.
This is the plan.	Wannan shi ne shirin.
It would be nice.	Zai yi kyau.
He failed.	Ya kasa.
I'm not sure.	Ban tabbata ba.
Everything is there.	Duk abin da yake can.
You can't do that.	Ba za ku iya yin haka ba.
Make them neat.	Sanya su da kyau.
You can't just change it.	Ba za ku iya canza shi kawai ba.
I knew it from the beginning.	Da na sani tun da farko.
I see no way.	Ban ga wata hanya ba.
Or, to make it better, for it to fit better.	Ko, don sanya shi mafi kyau, don shi ya dace da kyau.
God made it happen.	Allah yasa hakan ta faru.
They continue to work from morning till night.	Suna ci gaba da aiki tun safe zuwa dare.
That will never happen again.	Hakan ba zai sake faruwa ba.
There is no safe place to sit.	Babu wurin zama mai kyau.
He hoped he did not feel that way when he entered.	Ya yi fatan bai ji haka ba lokacin da ya shiga.
You know what we do.	Kun san abin da muke yi.
They never brought it up.	Ba su taba kawo shi ba.
Let's remember a little bit, how this came to be.	Bari mu ɗan tuna, yadda wannan ya bayyana.
I can’t do it myself.	Ba zan iya yin shi da kaina ba.
This is the most healthy time.	Wannan shine mafi yawan lokaci lafiya.
So, you don't tell anyone.	Don haka, ba ku gaya wa kowa ba.
She has nowhere to go.	Babu inda za ta.
He had a hard time, but he could do it.	Ya sami wahala, amma zai iya yin hakan.
And somehow he was there too.	Kuma ko ta yaya yana can kuma.
Not much to see.	Ba da yawa don gani ba.
This is just as difficult as it gets.	Wannan yana da matukar wahala kamar yadda ake samu.
I didn't find anything.	Ban sami komai ba.
They went in without water, and they went in without food.	Suka shiga ba ruwa, suka shiga ba abinci.
Maybe she thought there would be no fighting.	Wataƙila ta yi tunanin ba za a yi faɗa ba.
It is something we should do.	Abu ne da ya kamata mu yi.
I must know what is going on here.	Dole ne in san abin da ke faruwa a nan.
I am the man.	Ni ne mutumin.
They can run.	Suna iya gudu.
I am the only person in the house.	Ni kadai ne gidan mutum.
It was good for a while.	Ya yi kyau na ɗan lokaci.
and so on	na so
So he had to die.	Don haka dole ne ya mutu.
Do not be afraid to express how you feel.	Kada ku ji tsoron bayyana yadda kuke ji.
I can see myself eating.	Ina iya ganin kaina na ci.
The end of the day is exhausting.	Karshen ranar ta gaji.
He can get it.	Zai iya samun shi.
We must take it seriously.	Dole ne mu dauki shi da gaske.
To travel with others.	Don tafiya da sauran.
He knew what had happened in the past was in her.	Ya san abin da ya faru a baya yana cikin ta.
It seems a little more likely to succeed.	Da alama kadan zai iya yin nasara.
But after that, no problem.	Amma bayan haka, babu matsala.
I will never use them.	Ba zan taɓa amfani da su ba.
The game was hilarious.	Wasan ya kasance mai ban dariya.
He has work to do and he does.	Yana da aikin da zai yi kuma ya yi.
Just one game.	Wasa daya kawai.
Why is that? 	Me yasa haka?
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
Go back and look.	Koma baya ka duba.
You should come back with us.	Ya kamata ku dawo tare da mu.
Today that could be two.	Yau wannan zai iya zama biyu.
Or still in it.	Ko har yanzu a ciki.
She is away from you.	Ta tafi daga gare ku.
I do not know what to do.	Ban san abin da zan yi ba.
Not so much about.	Ba haka da yawa game da.
I got up and opened the door.	Na tashi na bude kofar.
It felt good there.	Ya ji dadi a wurin.
Show and tell.	Nuna kuma gaya.
You're sure, of course.	Kun tabbata, tabbas.
We made a mistake.	Mun yi kuskure.
I could not help it.	Na kasa taimaka masa.
Don't tell anyone, okay?	Kar ka gaya wa kowa, lafiya?
I will wait first to see if it passes.	Zan jira da farko in ga ko ya wuce.
I want to be healthy and happy again.	Ina so in sake samun lafiya da farin ciki.
But there is more we can do.	Amma akwai abubuwa da yawa da za mu iya yi.
They just want to live.	Suna son rayuwa kawai.
They are in the future.	Suna nan gaba.
But here it stands.	Amma a nan ya tsaya.
Departure time.	Lokacin tashi.
Or that we are all one.	Ko kuma cewa mu duka daya ne.
They take money.	Suna ɗaukar kuɗi.
I don't want to do anything but this.	Ba na son yin komai sai wannan.
This can happen at any time.	Wannan na iya faruwa a kowane lokaci.
When you have a problem, we have a problem.	Lokacin da kuke da matsala, muna da matsala.
Make sure they are happy.	Tabbatar suna farin ciki.
He filled it with oil.	Ya cika shi da mai.
I was about to win but one thing.	Na kusa samun nasara amma abu daya.
It will not hurt.	Ba zai yi rauni ba.
Hope it helps.	Da fatan zai taimaka.
Boy, do you think it would be so easy.	Yaro, kuna tsammanin zai kasance da sauƙi haka.
The door to the room is locked.	K'ofar d'akin ya rufe.
We knew he was there.	Mun san yana can.
They do not need to be afraid.	Ba sa bukatar tsoro.
We take care of your equipment.	Muna kula da kayan aikin ku.
Are we still talking to you?	Har muna magana da ku?
He returned to work yesterday.	Jiya ya koma bakin aiki.
This can be interesting after all.	Wannan na iya zama mai ban sha'awa bayan duka.
You can make a call.	Kuna iya yin kira.
But it is difficult to find a great man.	Amma yana da wuya a sami babban mutum.
I was so tired, my head hurt.	Na gaji sosai, kaina ya yi zafi.
It is his job.	Aikin sa ne.
All true help is needed.	Ana buƙatar duk taimako na gaske.
I want my cut, too.	Ina son yanke na, ma.
It is also thought to be very hot.	Ana kuma tunanin zai yi zafi sosai.
In fact, you shouldn’t.	A gaskiya, bai kamata ku yi ba.
The crowd is tired.	Taron ya gaji.
After three years they returned to travel.	Bayan shekaru uku suka koma tafiya.
He is involved in many things.	Yana da hannu cikin yin abubuwa da yawa.
I finally found my place.	Na sami wuri na a ƙarshe.
You went all this trouble.	Kun tafi duk wannan matsala.
It's good, as always.	Yana da kyau, kamar kullum.
Even though they don't look alike, he knows what they are.	Duk da ba su yi kama ba, ya san me suke.
I do not know what they are.	Ban san me suke ba.
I'll come there myself.	Zan zo can da kaina.
Everyone will be happy.	Kowa zai yi farin ciki.
It happens a lot in the game.	Yana faruwa sau da yawa a wasan.
Food run out.	Abinci ta kare.
I can't take it anymore.	Na kasa ɗauka kuma.
I was never told how it would work.	Ba a taba gaya min yadda zai yi aiki ba,.
Not there.	Ba a can.
A simple home party, that's all.	Bikin gida mai sauƙi, shi ke nan.
And we can continue all day.	Kuma za mu iya ci gaba duk rana.
He could not confirm any of these things.	Bai iya tabbatar da ko ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan abubuwan ba.
They are so beautiful, 'she said.	Suna da kyau da yawa,' in ji ta.
The allegations are unfounded.	Zargin ba su da tabbas.
But if it is true.	Amma idan gaskiya ne.
If anything, it becomes difficult.	Idan wani abu, ya zama mai wuya.
They will be better off.	Za su fi kyau.
Which still works today.	Wanda har yanzu suna aiki a yau.
Success, of course.	Nasara, ba shakka.
There is no time to explain why.	Babu lokacin bayyana dalilin.
They don’t want to know the best.	Ba sa son sanin mafi kyau.
It does more than that, however.	Yana yin fiye da haka, duk da haka.
She didn't feel the need to tell him the truth.	Bata ji bukatar ta fada masa gaskiya ba.
She has what she wants.	Tana da abin da take sha'awar.
Slowly she sat up.	A hankali ta zauna.
The water is flowing fast.	Ruwan yana gudu da sauri.
I will leave it to him.	Zan bar masa.
He wanted this.	Da ya so wannan.
They have no intelligence or will or life.	Ba su da hankali ko so ko rayuwa.
Not if she will get anything.	Ba idan za ta sami wani abu ba.
I will show you life.	Zan nuna maka rayuwa.
Otherwise, driving is a good way.	In ba haka ba, tuƙi hanya ce mai kyau.
This can be a useful tool.	Wannan na iya zama kayan aiki mai amfani.
He must have wondered how it would turn out.	Tabbas ya yi mamakin yadda ainihin abin zai kasance.
And it is not.	Kuma ba haka ba ne.
When we entered.	Lokacin da muka shiga.
The book you do not want to lose.	Littafin da ba ka so a rasa.
Slowly he closed the door.	A hankali ya rufe kofar.
Everyone knows that.	Kowa ya san haka.
Or, you know.	Ko, kun sani.
But it is good anyway.	Amma yana da kyau ta wata hanya.
She has nothing to eat.	Ba ta da abin ci.
She knew now what was going to happen, and she knew she wanted to.	Ta san yanzu abin da zai faru, kuma ta san cewa tana so.
They will love us for your sake.	Za su so mu saboda ku.
I could not hear.	Na kasa samun ji.
No, not people.	A'a, ba mutane ba.
It worked once.	Ya yi aiki sau ɗaya.
Let them continue to do so.	Su ci gaba da yin haka.
Life here is not as difficult as it may seem.	Rayuwa a nan ba ta da wahala kamar yadda zai iya bayyana.
And they are right.	Kuma tabbas sun yi gaskiya.
This is going to be a very difficult year.	Wannan zai zama shekara mai wahala sosai.
He felt uncomfortable but could not help anyone.	Ya ji babu dadi amma ba zai iya taimakon kowa ba.
You can take your time.	Kuna iya ɗaukar lokacin ku.
Let me meet the one you want me to meet.	Bari in hadu da wanda kuke so in hadu.
For everyone,.	Na kowane mutum,.
The man of that man.	Mutumin wannan mutumin.
I think it will be very good.	Ina ganin zai yi kyau sosai.
He hopes to study hard and succeed.	Ya yi fatan yin karatu sosai kuma ya yi nasara.
There is no reason for him to feel that way.	Babu dalilin da zai sa ya ji haka.
It's funny too.	Abin dariya ne kuma.
All known facts.	Duk abubuwan da aka sani.
Fix things now.	Gyara abubuwa yanzu.
Which is not very good.	Wanda ba shi da kyau sosai.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
People like them.	Mutane sun so su.
The project pays less than it would like.	Aikin ya biya kasa da yadda take so.
She also did not apologize.	Ita ma bata bashi hakuri ba.
They can't do that now.	Ba za su iya yin haka ba a yanzu.
But things have changed dramatically.	Amma abubuwa sun canza sosai.
Otherwise, we cannot live.	Idan ba haka ba, ba za mu iya rayuwa ba.
This will prove very difficult.	Wannan zai tabbatar da wahala sosai.
He makes us do what is right.	Ya sa mu yi abin da ya kamata.
I did not accept it immediately.	Ban yarda da shi nan take ba.
I got up	Na tashi
But that answer does not make sense.	Amma wannan amsa ba ta da hankali.
She is waiting for me to leave.	Tana jira in tafi.
We know a lot of life.	Mun san da yawa na rayuwa.
I have already decided.	Na riga na yanke shawarar.
He does not know yet.	Bai sani ba tukuna.
Provide everything needed.	Ba da duk abin da ake bukata.
You can take it from here to try it out.	Kuna iya ɗaukar shi daga nan don gwada shi.
Here is what you need to know.	Ga abin da kuke buƙatar sani.
They have been waiting for this man for a long time.	Sun dade suna jiran wannan mutumin.
I never did.	Ban taba yi ba.
The reading rate is very high.	Yawan karatu yana da yawa sosai.
Everything is a little weird until you realize it.	Komai na da ɗan ban mamaki har sai kun gane shi.
I know what will happen there.	Na san abin da zai faru a can.
It took a bit of work though.	Ya ɗauki ɗan aiki ko da yake.
It's too hot.	Yana da zafi sosai.
And so he was there early.	Kuma haka ya kasance a can da wuri.
Now you are talking.	Yanzu kuna magana.
I did all this.	Na yi duk wannan.
And they did.	Kuma suka yi.
Not just mine.	Ba nawa kawai ba.
This film is highly recommended.	Ana ba da shawarar wannan fim sosai.
It's very scary.	Yana da matukar ban tsoro.
She knew it wasn't her.	Ta san ba ita ba.
These crowds are just growing every year.	Waɗannan taron mutane suna girma ne kawai a kowace shekara.
The one who did, of course.	Wanda ya yi, ba shakka.
I will send it together.	Zan aika shi tare.
You will not enter, now.	Ba za ku shiga ba, yanzu.
I can't figure out why he isn't coming.	Ba zan iya gane dalilin da ya sa ba ya zuwa.
I do not know how many times.	Ban san sau nawa ba.
I have not read or heard of any problems with them.	Ban karanta ko jin labarin wata matsala da su ba.
I told her everything.	Na gaya mata komai.
There are two things we need to keep in mind.	Akwai abubuwa biyu da ya kamata mu kula.
Don't just go there.	Kada ku je can kawai.
He was taken away.	An tafi da shi.
If they have nothing, it shows.	Idan ba su da komai, yana nuna.
It’s such an amazing place.	Yana da irin wannan wuri mai ban mamaki.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
We can go somewhere.	Za mu iya zuwa wani wuri.
We are safe now.	Muna lafiya a yanzu.
They are almost always unrecognizable.	Kusan ko da yaushe ba a gane su ba.
It was something he achieved.	Wani abu ne da ya yi nasara.
He did not ask for this.	Bai nemi wannan ba.
I don’t want to be a thinker about it.	Ba na so in zama mai tunani game da shi.
Another cup of coffee, please.	Wani kofi na kofi, don Allah.
But not in this house.	Amma ba a gidan nan ba.
Think carefully.	Ka yi tunani a hankali.
I will do this every day.	Zan yi haka kowace rana.
You do not remember.	Ba ku tuna.
I am not married after all.	Ba ni da aure bayan duka.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba haka bane.
There are many opportunities.	Akwai dama dama.
No one wins.	Babu mutumin da ya ci nasara.
We are very concerned about this place.	Mun damu da wannan wuri sosai.
We can make progress if we work together.	Za mu iya samun ci gaba idan muka yi aiki tare.
So far, that hasn't happened.	Ya zuwa yanzu, hakan bai faru ba.
You do not know us.	Ba ku san mu ba.
He assured her of that.	Shi ma ya tabbatar mata da hakan.
Someone said he drank.	Wani ya ce ya sha.
We were in a new place.	Mun kasance a cikin sabon wuri.
This is the only thing that has worked closely for me so far.	Wannan shi ne kawai abin da ke kusa da aiki a gare ni ya zuwa yanzu.
We want to be there and give them a great game.	Muna so mu kasance a can kuma mu ba su babban wasa.
I thought about it.	Na yi tunani game da shi.
This is fun.	Wannan yana jin daɗi.
That could not happen.	Hakan bai iya faruwa ba.
Work confirms this conclusion.	Aiki yana tabbatar da wannan ƙarshe.
It's hard to miss it.	Da wuya a rasa shi.
Little by little.	Kadan kadan.
So you have to know where to call them.	Don haka dole ne ku san inda za ku kira su.
Not good, he thought.	Ba dadi, ya yi tunani.
John gave it to him.	John ya ba shi.
But it goes beyond that.	Amma ya wuce haka.
Keep checking.	Ci gaba da duba.
She quickly went back to the problem.	Da sauri ta koma matsala.
And now they know no.	Kuma yanzu sun san babu.
He is sad.	Yana cikin bakin ciki.
You helped me.	Kun taimake ni.
So if you do something, be the best.	Don haka idan kun yi wani abu, ku kasance mafi kyau.
Do not pay me anything.	Kar ku biya ni komai.
He has been waiting for this for a long time.	Ya dade yana jiran wannan.
This is the controller.	Wannan shi ne mai kula.
Just in two.	Kamar a cikin biyu.
You can not find them.	Ba za ku iya samun su ba.
Take care now.	Kula yanzu.
It happened again.	Ya sake faruwa.
You can talk to him.	Kuna iya magana da shi.
There is no time to think now.	Babu lokacin tunani yanzu.
Now we show.	Yanzu mun nuna.
He went out.	Ya fita.
We need to know who did it.	Muna bukatar mu san wanda ya yi.
Kids know nothing.	Yara ba su san komai ba.
Surely someone will see.	Tabbas wani zai gani.
We know this is difficult.	Mun san wannan yana da wahala.
There is something more frightening in you.	Akwai abin da ya fi tsoro girma a cikin ku.
They never told me.	Ba su taba gaya mani ba.
It gives you pleasure.	Ya ba ku dadi.
Doing one or the other, but not all, is not enough.	Yin ɗaya ko ɗaya, amma ba duka ba, bai isa ba.
Why can't they do something about it?	Me ya sa ba za su iya yin wani abu game da hakan ba?
I know it's hard to get into.	Na san yana da wuya a shiga.
But not for me.	Amma ba don ni ba.
He was.	Ya kasance.
I do not know what to do.	Ban san abin da za ku yi ba.
Please be prepared yourself.	Da fatan za a shirya kanku.
We found everything there.	Mun sami komai a wurin.
That's why we lied.	Shi ya sa muka yi karya.
Tom agrees with her.	Tom ya yarda da ita.
In the morning he left.	Da safe ya tafi.
They were married at the time.	Sun yi aure ne a lokacin.
And he shouted.	Kuma ya yi kara.
You are.	Kai ne.
It feels really good. 	Yana jin gaske sosai. 
A lot of people are not ready to get anything and that is fine.	Mutane da yawa ba su shirya don samun komai ba kuma hakan yayi kyau.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
No one knows what might happen next.	Babu wanda ya san abin da zai iya faruwa a gaba.
She laughed.	Ta yi dariya.
I hate that we should act like everyone else.	Na ƙi cewa mu yi kamar kowa ɗaya ne.
This has already happened.	Wannan ya riga ya faru.
And every year there is more to do.	Kuma kowace shekara akwai ƙarin abin yi.
All because of me.	Duk saboda ni.
Someone please give me a hand.	Wani don Allah a ba ni hannu.
I told him what had happened to me.	Na ba shi labarin abin da ya faru da ni.
But that did not help.	Amma hakan bai taimaka ba.
Maybe more than that.	Wataƙila fiye da haka.
They have never had before.	Ba su taɓa samun kafin.
But it did not start.	Amma ba a fara ba.
So we found out that no mistake was made.	Don haka mun gano cewa babu wani kuskure da ya faru.
It will take some time to do this.	Zai ɗauki ɗan lokaci don yin wannan.
And now they are three years old.	Kuma yanzu sun cika shekaru uku.
She doesn't want to play with me.	Ba ta son yin wasa da ni.
Here is one.	Ga daya a nan.
They will kill me.	Za su kashe ni.
And now he says something funny.	Yanzu kuma sai ya ce wani abu mai ban dariya.
It can put people there.	Yana iya sanya mutane a wurin.
I don't want to do these things.	Ba na son yin waɗannan abubuwa.
Not since school.	Ba tun lokacin makaranta ba.
I went to the place to do this thing with the book.	Na wuce wurin yin wannan abu da littafin.
It’s really good, really, really good.	Abu ne mai kyau gaske, gaske, mai kyau sosai.
When you are done, show everything.	Idan kun gama sai ku nuna komai.
I have never done such a thing.	Ban taba yin irin wannan abu ba.
He felt wrong.	Ya ji ba daidai ba.
But he should have left it there.	Amma ya kamata ya bar shi a can.
Sometimes you forget how good it is.	Wani lokaci ka manta da yadda yake da kyau.
We will not win.	Ba za mu ci nasara ba.
No, she said.	A'a, ta ce.
Everyone else.	Duk sauran.
Probably not.	Wataƙila ba za su yi ba.
You can not have a good time.	Ba za ku iya samun lokaci mai kyau ba.
So he was surprised.	A haka ya yi mamaki.
They can talk more later.	Za su iya ƙara magana daga baya.
What happens if the road is blocked?	Me zai faru idan aka tare hanya?
But it does not have to be this way.	Amma bai kamata ya kasance haka ba.
It tasted amazing.	Ya ji dadi mai ban mamaki.
I don't like it here anymore.	Ba na son shi a nan kuma.
We do not know what we are up to.	Ba mu san abin da muke gaba da shi ba.
The water level is good.	Ruwan ruwan ya yi kyau.
Your game is not good.	Wasan ku bai yi kyau ba.
We lied a lot.	Mun yi karya sosai.
He does not hear.	Ba ya ji.
I'm pretty sure.	Na tabbata sosai.
She immediately thought he was leaving the room.	Nan take ta dauka zai bar dakin.
It doesn't matter.	Ba komai.
They love them too.	Su ma suna son su.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Kamar bata hannu.
This works as follows.	Wannan yana aiki kamar haka.
Everything else, he is doing well.	Komai sauran, yana yin kyau.
I really like it.	Ina son shi da gaske.
I will not go like this.	Ba zan tafi haka ba.
Take care of it.	Kula da shi .
It has a wonderful sense of wonder.	Yana da kyakkyawan ji na ban mamaki.
She usually only eats once a day.	Kullum tana cin abinci sau ɗaya kawai a rana.
For me, there are two things to run backwards.	A gare ni, akwai abubuwa guda biyu don gudu baya.
You will have to deal with it in time.	Za ku sami yin aiki da shi cikin lokaci.
The movie comes to an end.	Fim ɗin ya zo ƙarshe.
There is nothing you can do.	Babu abin da za ku iya yi.
I’ve never been to anyone.	Ban taba zuwa ga kowa ba.
Many people are injured every year.	Mutane da yawa suna ji rauni kowace shekara.
He just got it.	Ya samu kawai.
You have to think fast.	Dole ne ku yi tunani da sauri.
But he is walking slowly.	Amma yana tafiya a hankali.
It is a hot day.	Rana ce mai zafi.
He can't think of that right now.	Ya kasa tunanin wannan a yanzu.
Slowly she closed the door.	A hankali ta rufe kofar.
The reason is so many people.	Dalilin yana da yawa mutane.
This is nothing new.	Wannan ba sabon abu bane.
Inhabit!	Zauna!
They are not here.	Ba su nan.
It is a common practice.	Abu ne da aka saba yi.
That would also be a mistake.	Hakan ma zai yi kuskure.
This is not.	Wannan ya ba .
I talked a lot, and quickly.	Na yi magana da yawa, kuma da sauri.
Stay still for the weekend and be happy.	Zauna har yanzu don karshen mako kuma ku kasance cikin farin ciki.
I looked at the road and did not see it coming.	Ina kallon hanya ban ga tana zuwa ba.
He’s not scared, right.	Bai ji tsoro ba, daidai.
That doesn't matter.	Hakan ba komai.
I haven't made any users yet.	Ban yi wani mai amfani ba tukuna.
See here.	Duba nan.
She doesn't feel anything.	Bata jin komai.
Or leave the house.	Ko barin gidan.
They are fighting over money.	Suna fada ne akan kudi.
She is coming again.	Ta sake zuwa.
There was no food and no heat.	Babu abinci a wurin kuma babu zafi.
And he sat down.	Kuma ya zauna .
They make their way to heaven.	Suna yin hanyar sama.
It will not be released.	Ba za a sake shi ba.
Too much to take.	Ya yi yawa don ɗauka.
I feel so good.	Na ji dadi sosai.
If it doesn’t grow, try it somewhere.	Idan bai girma ba, gwada shi a wani wuri.
The whole house told us.	Duk gidan ya fada mana.
Please take care of yourself.	Da fatan za a kula da kanku.
In the end, it all comes down to you.	A ƙarshe, duk ya zo kan kai.
I just feel like it.	Ina jin haka kawai.
I’ve done it before.	Na taba yi a baya.
Stop them there.	Ka tsaya su a can.
That makes it difficult to help you.	Hakan ya sa yana da wahala a taimaka muku.
Ask someone to do something for you.	Ka tambayi wani ya yi wani abu.
Nothing has really changed.	Babu wani abu da ya canza da gaske.
But now that too is gone.	Amma yanzu wannan ma ya tafi.
They fly together.	Suna tashi tare.
But this once.	Amma wannan sau ɗaya.
It worked really well.	Ya yi aiki da kyau sosai.
Let us not forget the past.	Kada mu manta da abin da ya gabata.
Where have you been.	A ina kuka kasance.
You should come overnight.	Ya kamata ku zo dare ɗaya.
Maybe you did.	Wataƙila kun yi.
Who knows how many people.	Wanene ya san yawan mutane.
I do not think myself wedding.	Ba na tunanin kaina bikin aure.
It's too late now.	Wannan yanzu ya yi kadan, ya makara.
I do not remember anything.	Ban tuna komai ba.
We should be happy.	Ya kamata mu yi farin ciki.
The way to the world without fear.	Hanyar zuwa duniya ba tare da tsoro ba.
She removed them completely and left them.	Ta cire su gaba daya ta bar su.
I knew she was there somewhere.	Na san tana can wani wuri.
They went in the car.	Suka tafi cikin mota.
I do not usually sit outside.	Ban saba zama a waje ba.
But he reappeared.	Amma kansa ya sake bayyana.
You will be fine.	Za ku kasance lafiya.
Maybe that's why he didn't feel he could tell anyone.	Wataƙila shi ya sa bai ji zai iya gaya wa kowa ba.
Can he do it? 	Zai iya yi?
He was surprised.	Yayi mamaki.
This is not a big mistake.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne mai girma.
She says she has never been to a better place.	Ta ce ba ta taba zuwa wani wuri mai kyau ba.
We cannot move forward for the present life.	Ba za mu iya kawo gaba don rayuwa ta yanzu ba.
We are waiting for people to come and take me away.	Muna jiran mutane suna zuwa su tafi da ni.
I'm not interested in that.	Ba ni da sha'awar hakan.
I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.	Ba na zo don ɗaukar sauƙi a kan ku ba.
But fear can be a good thing.	Amma tsoro na iya zama abu mai kyau.
No, she is not well.	A'a, ba ta da lafiya.
However, we have food.	Duk da haka, muna da abinci.
But not necessarily.	Amma ba lallai ba ne.
But first she had to get involved.	Amma da farko dole ta shiga ciki.
Life is not good, there is no way to go about it.	Rayuwa ba dadi, babu yadda za a yi a kusa da hakan.
This must be correct.	Dole ne wannan yayi daidai.
Maybe I had never read this otherwise.	Wataƙila ban taɓa karanta wannan ba in ba haka ba.
I know what it takes to be successful.	Na san abin da ake bukata don samun nasara.
You can't catch them easily.	Ba za ku iya kama su cikin sauƙi ba.
The police should protect this from that.	'Yan sanda su kare hakan daga wannan.
You are not old enough.	Ba ka girma haka ba tukuna.
However none could be found.	Duk da haka ba a iya samun ko ɗaya ba.
I feel you do not know me.	Ina jin ba ku san ni ba.
I still like it.	Har yanzu ina so.
I think that’s really good, really interesting.	Ina tsammanin hakan yana da kyau sosai, mai ban sha'awa sosai.
Do not touch!	Kar a taɓa!
If he were.	Idan ya kasance.
They can really go anywhere you want.	Suna iya tafiya da gaske a duk inda kuke so.
I say exactly what happened.	Ina faɗa daidai abin da ya faru.
There is truth in that.	Akwai gaskiya akan hakan.
I suggest you spend the night here.	Ina ba ku shawarar ku kwana a nan.
Nothing looks good.	Babu wani abu da ya yi kama da kyau.
It's huge.	Yana da girma.
You are right about that.	Kun yi gaskiya game da hakan.
I want you to die with me.	Ina so ku mutu tare da ni.
I did not expect him to.	Ban yi tsammanin zai yi ba.
He is on a plane.	Yana cikin jirgin sama.
I do not agree with him.	Ban yarda da shi ba.
For a while the problem was still there.	Har zuwa wani lokaci matsalar har yanzu tana nan.
He knew what to say next.	Ya san abin da zai ce a gaba.
There is no time to look for more food.	Babu lokacin neman ƙarin abinci.
This is incorrect.	Wannan ba daidai ba ne.
They did a good job for her.	Sun yi mata kyakkyawan aiki.
No one is ready.	Babu wanda ya shirya.
Only other people.	Sauran mutane ne kawai.
The story itself made me think a lot.	Labarin da kansa ya yi min tunani sosai.
How can that be?	Ta yaya hakan zai kasance?
Everyone went on.	Kowa ya ci gaba.
We were worried, but not much, not really.	Mun damu, amma ba yawa, ba da gaske ba.
And yet, they are there.	Amma duk da haka, suna can.
Everyone or less.	Kowa ko kadan.
There is a car in front.	Akwai mota a gaba.
It is not safe to be together.	Ba lafiya su kasance tare ba.
Not safe, they would say.	Ba lafiya, za su ce.
He must die.	Dole ne ya mutu.
We have to go.	Dole mu tafi.
They were very accommodating.	Sun kasance masu yarda sosai.
I do not know.	Ban san haka ba.
If nothing else, you feel good.	Idan babu wani abu, kun ji daɗi.
But only if you want to.	Amma kawai idan kuna so.
But it is a joke.	Amma abin wasa ne.
Of course it will do well.	Tabbas zai yi kyau.
Decide who can reach you, and when.	Yanke shawarar wanda zai iya isa gare ku, da kuma yaushe.
So if you get a chance to run, do it.	Don haka idan kun sami damar yin gudu, yi.
My seating plan is already known.	Shirin zama na ya riga ya sani.
But there is also.	Amma akwai kuma.
Listen, we're running back here.	Ji, muna gudu a baya a nan.
We want that kind of person.	Muna son irin wannan mutumin.
She is always busy.	Kullum tana cikin aiki.
First, read the following.	Da farko, karanta waɗannan.
This is what we know for sure.	Wannan shi ne abin da muka sani tabbas.
You can buy anything there.	Kuna iya siyan komai a wurin.
Much success with women, early.	Nasara da yawa tare da mata, da wuri.
I don’t know, of course.	Ban sani ba, ba shakka.
And of course others will.	Kuma lallai wasu za su yi.
She was just.	Ta kasance kawai.
I will be very cold about both.	Zan yi sanyi sosai game da duka.
Make me sleep properly.	Ka sa ni barci daidai.
I bought this book yesterday.	Na sayi wannan littafin jiya.
That's very good.	Hakan yayi kyau sosai.
There is no way he can eat now.	Babu yadda zai iya ci yanzu.
It is better to stop.	Yana da kyau mu daina.
Or give it to someone else.	Ko kuma a ba wa wani.
Not a big surprise.	Ba wani babban abin mamaki ba.
As far as you can go.	Kamar yadda za ku iya tafiya.
I am a human being.	Ni mutum ne nawa.
I know you have to.	Na san dole ka yi.
Things are not so real in real life.	Abubuwa ba haka suke ba a rayuwa ta gaske.
They all ran away.	Gaba daya suka gudu.
It would be better to come quickly, though.	Zai fi kyau a zo da sauri, ko da yake.
I'll give it a chance, though.	Zan ba shi dama, ko da yake.
You will not be able to get there before the cold season arrives.	Ba za ku iya zuwa wurin ba kafin lokacin sanyi ya shiga.
Surely you are not going to let that happen.	Lallai babu ku da za ku bar abin ya faru.
It does not seem to be succeeding.	Da alama ba zata yi nasara ba.
The flight is three days.	Jirgin yana kwana uku.
There are so many good things so.	Akwai abubuwa masu kyau da yawa haka.
See how we drank together.	Kalli yadda muka sha tare.
Continue after these people.	Ci gaba bayan waɗannan mutane.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
She has never been successful.	Ba ta taba samun nasara ba.
Go ahead.	Fita a gaba.
You have been truthful in many things.	Kun yi gaskiya game da abubuwa da yawa.
People are sleeping because of the heat.	Mutane sun ji barci saboda zafi.
Exactly what they wanted to hear.	Daidai abin da suke so su ji.
No more love.	Babu sauran so.
I hope it works well.	Ina fatan yana aiki da kyau.
The first, however, is uncertain.	Na farko, duk da haka, ba shi da tabbas.
You do things together.	Kuna yin abubuwa tare.
I will explain one thing.	Zan bayyana abu daya.
He would have killed me.	Da ya kashe ni.
So, do something !.	Don haka, yi wani abu!.
So be it.	Haka ya kasance.
That would be good for her.	Wannan zai yi mata kyau.
But we can no longer be sure.	Amma ba za mu iya ƙara tabbata ba.
It looks so good.	Yayi kyau sosai.
But not this man.	Amma ba wannan mutumin ba.
It has now been removed.	Yanzu an cire shi.
They complained, but did not know.	Sun yi zargin, amma ba su sani ba.
They didn't tell me anything.	Ba su gaya mani komai ba.
He is the man of the house now.	Shi ne mutumin gidan yanzu.
This is a lie.	Wannan wata karya ce.
There is no way out.	Babu wata hanya ta.
Give him as much time as he needs.	Ka ba shi lokaci mai yawa kamar yadda ake bukata.
Show me how many women you are.	Ka nuna mata nawa ne kai.

He still can.	Har yanzu yana iya.
We live here, whether we like it or not.	Muna zama a nan, ko muna so ko ba a so.
And there is not much time.	Kuma babu lokaci mai yawa.
Each song fits exactly where one would expect it to fit.	Kowace waƙa ta dace da inda mutum zai yi tsammanin za ta dace.
Others feel the same way.	Wasu kuma sun ji haka.
In real life.	A rayuwa ta gaske.
They do not want to play.	Ba sa son yin wasa.
I want to succeed because success will make me money.	Ina so in yi nasara saboda nasara zai sa ni kudi.
She says sometimes it takes until you are thirty.	Ta ce wani lokacin yana ɗauka har sai kun kai talatin.
Some people are walking.	Wasu mutane suna tafiya.
This is not a school.	Wannan ba makaranta ba ce.
That's just the way it is.	Haka kawai yake.
We will travel by boat.	Za mu yi tafiya a cikin jirgin ruwa.
He wants to do that.	Yana son yin hakan.
This ark is full of people.	Wannan jirgin ya cika da mutane.
We want that to stop.	Muna son hakan ya tsaya.
I am a thing for you.	Ni abu ne a gare ku.

All this time trying just to win.	Duk wannan lokacin da ƙoƙarin kawai don cin nasara.

You will lose sleep.	Za ku rasa barci.
This is a new development.	Wannan sabon ci gaba ne.
Not at work, not at home.	Ba a wurin aiki, ba a gida ba.
He knew he had to forget it.	Ya san dole ya manta da ita.
Not much was said.	Ba a yi magana da yawa ba.
Hopefully it will be your way forward.	Da fatan za a yi hanyar ku zuwa gaba.
It is a difficult task.	Aiki ne mai wahala.
Let them see how they like.	Bari su gani yadda suke so.
Happy reading.	Karatu mai daɗi.

You cannot guarantee anything to anyone.	Ba za ku iya tabbatar wa kowa komai ba.
Great thing.	Babban abu.
You see this.	Kun ga wannan.
Now he asks her this.	Yanzu ya tambaye ta wannan.
There will be no second chance.	Ba za a sami dama ta biyu ba.
Add one and you're done.	Ƙara ɗaya kuma kun gama.
If you read, read.	Idan ka karanta, karanta.
Give me a sign.	Ka ba ni alama.
All you have to do is wait.	Babu abin yi sai jira.
Do not be hard on yourself!	Kada ku kasance da wuya a kan kanku!
And they were.	Kuma sun kasance.
When it comes close, you don't have to worry.	Idan ya zo kusa, ba ku damu ba.

You just want to look.	Kuna so ku duba kawai.

Tomorrow is a difficult day.	Gobe ​​wata rana ce mai wahala.
There is no way.	Babu wata hanya.

You do not want things to change.	Ba ku son abubuwa su canza.

He must have failed to express himself.	Lallai ya kasa bayyana kansa.
You have to be careful and thoughtful.	Dole ne ku yi hankali da tunani.

No, it is not.	A'a, ba shi ba ne.
Bring me a clear problem.	Kawo mani matsala ta bayyana.
Let's go home.	Zo mu tafi gida.
But the difficulty, that he must accept.	Amma wahala, cewa dole ne ya yarda.
He heard that.	Ya ji haka.
She left me.	Ta bar ni.
Drink water she said.	Sha ruwa ta ce.
He is the only child.	Shi kadai ne yaro.
But this should not come as a surprise.	Amma wannan bai kamata ya zama abin mamaki ba.
Someone in her.	Wani a cikin ta.
Or put on a dress that says so.	Ko kuma sanya masa rigar da ta ce haka.

For the second, we use.	Don na biyu, muna amfani.
Or whatever you want.	Ko abin da kuke so.

I did them in a year.	Na yi su a cikin shekara guda.
True, it is about someone else.	Gaskiya ne, game da wani ne.
I'll go when he calls.	Zan tafi idan ya kira.
This can be a mistake.	Wannan na iya zama kuskure.
I do not know where we live.	Ban san inda muke zama ba.
He just told you.	Ya gaya maka kawai.
Just to watch you.	Don kallon ku kawai.
However, this is strange to say the least.	Duk da haka, wannan yana da ban mamaki a ce ko kaɗan.
The rain stopped.	Ruwan sama ya tsaya.

The man did not look like that.	Mutumin kamar haka bai yi kama ba.
That's how kids play.	Haka yara ke wasa.
Just try again.	Kawai gwada sake.
Without you, it cannot happen.	Ba tare da kai ba, ba zai iya faruwa ba.
I thought she needed to go outside again.	Na dauka tana bukatar ta sake fita waje.
The food began to run out.	Abinci ya fara kare.
You may be good, but still stand for yourself.	Kuna iya zama mai kyau, amma har yanzu tsaya wa kanku.

I do not know where we are going.	Ban san inda za mu ba.
He even thought of eating.	Har ma yayi tunanin ci.
They are late to school.	Sun makara zuwa makaranta.
We must keep these things in mind.	Dole ne mu tuna da waɗannan abubuwan.
He could not do that.	Ya kasa yin hakan.
This is a terrible thing.	Wannan mummunan abu ne.

You did not pass.	Ba ku wuce ba.
It's a quick and easy way.	Hanya ce mai sauri da sauƙi.
Inside and out.	A ciki da waje.
But first you have to explain a few things.	Amma da farko dole ne ku bayyana wasu abubuwa kaɗan.
And so everything works fine.	Kuma kamar haka komai yana aiki daidai.
Please do not take this inappropriate approach.	Don Allah kar a ɗauki wannan hanyar da ba ta dace ba.
I did not hear anything.	Ban ji komai ba.
That's what you told me.	Abin da ka gaya mani ke nan.

You can stay here, if you want.	Kuna iya kwana a nan, idan kuna so.
I'll let myself out.	Zan bar kaina na fita.
I do not know who.	Ban san wanene ba.
They will never tell you that you did a good job.	Ba za su taɓa gaya muku cewa kun yi aiki mai kyau ba.
Hope to go, now.	Da fatan za a tafi, yanzu.
Tell him to come with me, if you will.	Ka ce masa ya zo tare da ni, in kana so.
This does not always happen, however.	Wannan ba koyaushe yake faruwa ba, duk da haka.

And where it came from, no one knows.	Kuma daga ina ya fito, ba wanda ya sani.

Not necessarily true.	Ba lallai ba ne gaskiya.
I began to feel sleepy.	Na fara jin barci.
She wanted to catch the moment.	Ta so ta kama lokacin.
I, as they say, am cold.	Ni, kamar yadda suke faɗa, ina cikin sanyi.
We are glad to hear that.	Mun yi farin ciki da jin haka.
This is real.	Wannan shi ne da gaske.
We have to go back now.	Dole ne mu koma yanzu.
I love it all.	Ina son shi duka.
I'm sure you will.	Na tabbata za ku yi haka.
It's been 30 years.	Shekaru talatin kenan.
I'm not even here, very talkative.	Ba ni ma a nan, magana sosai.
They want to do the right thing but they can't.	Suna son yin abin da ya dace amma ba za su iya ba.
Nothing new to see here.	Babu wani sabon abu da za a gani a nan.
Leave it to us.	Ka bar mana haka.
But forget that.	Amma manta da haka.
Start walking.	Fara tafiya.
You are smart.	Kuna da hankali.
I am one of the sick.	Ni daya na rashin lafiya.
Just be prepared.	Kawai a shirya.
Remember the big plan.	Ka tuna da babban shirin.
I will not go back and do it again.	Ba zan koma in sake yin ba.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a san abin da zai iya faruwa da shi ba.
Do not eat too much.	Kada ku ci da yawa.
He spoke but never did.	Yayi magana amma bai taba ba.
You can't think about it.	Ba za ku iya yin tunani game da shi ba.
It's not a big deal.	Ba wani babban abu ba ne.
The best that can happen to a good game.	Mafi kyawun abin da zai iya faruwa ga kyakkyawan wasan.
It's too much and everything.	Ya yi yawa da komai.
He did not wear a necklace.	Bai sa abin wuya ba.
I can see why she loves them.	Ina iya ganin dalilin da yasa take son su.
One seems to have preceded the other two or three.	Daya kamar ya riga sauran biyu ko uku.
Here she goes today.	Nan zata je yau.
I do not know how, but he was right.	Ban san yadda ba, amma ya yi gaskiya.
That will never happen again.	Hakan ba zai sake faruwa ba.
And the problem is in the game.	Kuma matsalar da ke cikin wasa.
Please hope this is a job for you.	Don Allah da fatan wannan aiki ne a gare ku.
Not so.	Ba haka take ba.
He told me exactly how to do it.	Ya gaya mani daidai yadda zai yi.
None of this.	Babu ɗaya daga cikin wannan.
He can kill me if he wants to.	Zai iya kashe ni idan ya so.
Perhaps, the truth is just over time.	Wataƙila, gaskiya ta wuce lokaci kawai.
We start looking here right now.	Mun fara duba nan da yanzu.
That can be difficult.	Hakan na iya zama mai wahala.
This is the way of the world, after all.	Wannan ita ce hanyar duniya, bayan haka.
He felt very ill to help.	Ya ji rashin lafiya sosai don ya taimaka.
He knew they would fit.	Ya san za su dace.
This is not a problem.	Wannan ba matsala.
You hear it a lot.	Kuna jin shi da yawa.
But that is the end.	Amma wannan shine karshen.
Things he wants to know.	Abubuwan da ya ke so ya sani.
All he wanted to do was run and play.	Duk abin da yake so ya yi shi ne ya gudu ya yi wasa.
Of course someone must have heard.	Tabbas dole ne wani ya ji.
I don't see why you do it.	Ban ga dalilin da yasa kuke yi ba.
It became only one.	Sai ya zama daya ne kawai.
I died wrong in the past.	Na mutu ba daidai ba a baya.
Although it would not be an easy answer with it.	Ko da yake ba zai zama amsa mai sauƙi da ita ba.
It was early in the morning when everyone got up.	Sai da safe kowa ya tashi.
All is not well.	Duk ba shi da kyau.
You have to be, like, your best.	Dole ne ku zama, kamar, mafi kyawun ku.
We can't talk about that.	Ba za mu iya magana game da hakan ba.
Success is needed to see this.	Ana buƙatar nasara don ganin wannan.
I started giving someone but he said no.	Na fara ba da wani amma ya nuna a'a.
I saw that it was good.	Na ga cewa yana da kyau.
And it can be.	Kuma tana iya zama.
I love the white that expresses itself.	Ina son farin da ke bayyana kansa.
The truth is not so close.	Gaskiya ma ba kusa ba.
Too much water, too little.	Ruwa da yawa, wuri kaɗan.
He showed everyone carefully, doing the hard work.	Ya nuna kowane mutum a hankali, yana yin aiki mai wahala.
Remember how we used to.	Ka tuna yadda muka saba.
I am not the one you usually know.	Ni ba wanda kuka saba sani ba.
Night travel is not recommended.	Ba a ba da shawarar yin tafiya da dare ba.
It was a wonderful time.	Lokaci ne mai ban mamaki sosai.
Who's next?	Wanene na gaba?
We did not.	Ba mu yi ba.
I have never lost a game.	Ban taba yin rashin nasara a kowane wasa ba.
We want to stay here for the night.	Muna so mu tsaya a nan don dare.
I want you to enjoy the outdoors	Ina son ku ji daɗin waje
I earn more than he does.	Ina samun kuɗi fiye da yadda yake yi.
It is wrong to think of people.	Ba daidai ba ne a yi tunanin mutane.
But then she realized.	Amma sai ta gane.
Get up, get up.	Tashi, tashi.
You have to have it.	Dole sai da ita.
He got up.	Ya tashi.
They say it is by waiting.	Sun ce ta hanyar jira ne.
But she used it.	Amma ta yi amfani da shi.
He almost laughed to himself.	Ya kusa yi wa kansa dariya.
Let them both die.	Su biyu su mutu.
You do not need to run.	Ba ku buƙatar gudu.
But that does not work.	Amma wannan ba ya aiki.
He did not add.	Bai kuma kara ba.
You only care about yourself.	Kuna damu da ku kawai.
You’re about to run.	Kuna yi don gudu.
We want everything.	Muna son komai.
Do not hesitate.	Kada ku yi shakka.
At least not from him.	Ko kadan ba daga gare shi ba.
He can't run.	Ba zai iya gudu ba.
The food supply is full.	Abincin abinci ya cika.
I apologize to him.	Ina ba shi hakuri.
Everything is going well.	Komai yana tafiya daidai.
Those who do.	Wanda suka yi.
Maybe he does.	Wataƙila yana yi.
We will not always be right.	Ba koyaushe za mu kasance daidai ba.
Stop thinking it will come.	Ka daina tunani zai zo.
This is not safe.	Wannan ba lafiya ba ne.
Write it down.	Rubuta shi.
Please anyone can help.	Don Allah kowa zai iya taimaka.
It was very interesting.	Ya kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
Just want to believe they know better.	Kawai son yarda sun fi sani.
I really agree with them.	Na yarda da su sosai.
Come on in, take a look.	Zo ta fada a hankali.
I'm not going to sleep tonight, she thought.	Ba zan yi barci a daren nan ba, ta yi tunani.
You girls.	Ku 'yan mata.
You wouldn’t want to have the opportunity to do it.	Ba za ku so cewa kun sami damar yin shi ba.
They had no answer, so he gave them some help.	Ba su da amsa, don haka ya ba su wani taimako.
The water is cold.	Ruwan ya yi sanyi.
I hope someone can show me the right way.	Ina fata wani zai iya nuna mani hanyar da ta dace.
And so you make money.	Kuma haka kuke samun kuɗi.
As you can see, there is an error.	Kamar yadda kuke gani, akwai kuskure.
It felt good.	An ji dadi.
This is the last one.	Wannan shi ne na karshen.
I can't think who this person is.	Ba zan iya tunanin wanene wannan mutumin ba.
Don't worry about us.	Kada ku damu da mu.
But you should remember that he is only a child.	Amma ya kamata ka tuna cewa yaro ne kawai.
All for the best.	Duk don mafi kyau.
The bathroom.	Bakin dakin.
But you see fit.	Amma ka ga ya dace.
I allowed her to say or sign.	Na yarda ta fada ko ta sa hannu.
Is that the answer?	Wannan amsa ce?
We can't make it happen.	Ba za mu iya sa ya faru ba.
Please help us do what we should have done in the first place.	Don Allah a taimake mu mu yi abin da ya kamata mu yi tun farko.
Of course, that is difficult.	Tabbas hakan yana da wahala.
It bothers me.	Ya damu ni.
How were you?	Yaya kuka kasance?
In fact, it may be fair to assume that you are not yourself.	A gaskiya ma, yana iya zama daidai a ɗauka cewa ba kai ba ne.
I have to work on myself.	Dole ne in yi aiki da kaina.
There is no way to say.	Babu wata hanyar da za a ce.
I can't do anything about it.	Ba zan iya yin komai game da wannan ba.
So do not be afraid to make mistakes.	Don haka kada ku ji tsoron yin kuskure.
I tried to catch everything.	Na yi ƙoƙarin kama komai.
Turn it off if necessary.	Kashe shi idan dole ne.
Probably the best player.	Wataƙila shi ne mafi kyawun ɗan wasa.
It’s hard to take it seriously sometimes.	Yana da wuya a ɗauka da gaske wani lokaci.
Appears like the sun.	Bayyana kamar rana.
But interesting things are only in the game.	Amma abubuwan ban sha'awa suna cikin wasan ne kawai.
Had he been there.	Da ya kasance a can.
We love them.	Muna son su.
Say something funny and they should not laugh.	Sai ka ce wani abu mai ban dariya kuma kada su yi dariya.
We can keep going.	Za mu iya ci gaba da ci gaba.
But it's good.	Amma yana da kyau.
I decided to go on my own.	Na yanke shawarar tafiya da kaina.
He wants to sleep.	Yana son barci.
If you do not agree with her, tell her.	Idan baka yarda da ita ba, ka gaya mata haka.
He started getting there.	Ya fara zuwa can.
And a big name too.	Kuma babban suna ma.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
He will not run this time.	Ba zai gudu wannan lokacin ba.
Continue to close when not in use.	Ci gaba da rufe lokacin da ba a amfani da shi.
She could not stop crying.	Ta kasa daina kuka.
Before eating.	Kafin a ci shi.
Sure, it can be difficult, but some people get involved.	Tabbas, yana iya zama mai wahala, amma wasu mutane suna shiga.
I will get more work tomorrow.	Zan sami ƙarin aikin gobe.
Continue to this day.	Ci gaba har yau.
He slept in the car.	Ya kwana a cikin motar.
He does not do that.	Ba ya yin haka.
They are not joking.	Ba wasa suke ba.
They did not run away.	Ba su gudu ba.
Stay safe there.	A zauna lafiya a can.
I think we are too late for that.	Ina tsammanin mun makara don haka.
They love people like us.	Suna son mutane kamar mu.
Save lives.	Ajiye rayuwa.
Some are not very intelligent.	Wasu ba su da hankali sosai.
And every next day.	Kuma kowace rana mai zuwa.
Let things know it's here.	Bari abubuwa su sani yana nan.
If you ask me, you will not get an answer.	Idan ka tambaye ni, ba za ka sami amsa.
And I have my way about something.	Kuma ina da hanya ta game da wani abu.
The next cold they killed him.	Da sanyi mai zuwa suka kashe shi.
Hurry up, get it! 	Yi sauri, samu!
They made a mistake, you know.	Sun yi kuskure, ka sani.
They do not have to think very much.	Ba lallai ba ne su yi tunani da yawa da yawa.
They keep walking with it.	Suna ci gaba da tafiya da shi.
I know nothing about it.	Ban san komai game da shi ba.
Three is enough.	Uku ya isa.
For me, this is always a problem.	A gare ni, wannan koyaushe matsala ce.
That was not the case.	Ba haka ya kasance ba.
But no small improvement was to be seen.	Amma babu wani ci gaba kadan da za a gani.
It should be delicious.	Ya kamata ya zama mai daɗi.
Things are moving fast.	Abubuwa suna tafiya da sauri.
She wondered why there were two.	Ta yi mamakin dalilin da ya sa aka zama biyu.
He had to learn to answer him.	Sai da ya koyi amsa masa.
We will go back there now.	Za mu koma can yanzu.
We are alive.	Muna da rai.
I look at them.	Ina kallon su.
And no one.	Kuma babu kowa.
You do not even see what killed them.	Ba ka ma ganin abin da ya kashe su.
This is a good sign.	Wannan alama ce mai kyau.
She will be fine.	Za ta yi daidai.
But we must be careful.	Amma dole ne mu yi hankali.
The second is, you are not.	Na biyu shi ne, ba ku ba.
More than anything we got.	Fiye da duk abin da muka samu.
This in itself should not surprise one.	Wannan shi kansa bai kamata ya ba mutum mamaki ba.
I can't, in fact.	Ba zan iya ba, a gaskiya.
It is just what we need to do.	Shi ne kawai abin da muke bukata mu yi.
You must try.	Dole ne ku gwada.
It helps us to keep working.	Yana taimaka mana mu ci gaba da aikin.
Now, come on.	Yanzu, zo.
And then there is a need.	Kuma sai ga wata bukata.
What it is, we do not know.	Abin da ya kasance, ba mu sani ba.
They let us pass.	Sun bar mu mu wuce.
One and two.	Daya da biyu.
There is something or someone in it.	Akwai wani abu ko wani a ciki.
Nothing is happening.	Babu wani abu da ke faruwa.
You are close.	Kun kasance kusa.
I think we succeeded until we left.	Ina tsammanin mun yi nasara har muka tafi.
You can't go on, you're outside.	Ba za ku iya ci gaba ba, kun kasance a waje.
They only need three things.	Abu uku ne kawai suke bukata.
Who knows.	Wanene ya sani.
He plans to stay here for a while.	Ya shirya zama a nan na ɗan lokaci.
Maybe I will one day.	Wataƙila zan yi wata rana.
We grew up growing.	Mun girma girma.
Everyone fails.	Kowa ya kasa.
She did not come home.	Bata zo gida ba.
He can only walk backwards, and we are there.	Yana iya tafiya kawai ta baya, kuma muna can.
You will lose everything in time.	Za ku rasa komai cikin lokaci.
And she just passed.	Kuma ta wuce kawai.
This method will never be repeated.	Ba za a sake ba da wannan hanyar ba.
You seem to be nervous about everything.	Kuna da alama kuna jin tsoro game da komai.
He did not stop to think.	Bai tsaya tunani ba.
For the first time they do it.	A karo na farko suna yin shi.
Had he loved her.	Da ya kasance yana son ta.
I am still so.	Ina har yanzu haka.
Time has passed and there is no answer.	Lokaci ya wuce kuma babu amsa.
You can get there by boat again.	Kuna iya zuwa can ta hanyar jirgin ruwa kuma.
It's near the front.	Yana kusa da gaba.
But you stayed with him.	Amma kun zauna da shi.
I like a lot of kids.	Ina son yara da yawa.
Everything is true.	Komai wannan labarin gaskiya ne.
This is not funny.	Wannan ba abin ban dariya ba ne.
Why would she not leave him?	Me ya sa ba za ta bar shi ba?
They know it's coming now.	Sun san yana zuwa yanzu.
She raises her head.	Ta daga kai.
But he was quick to do so.	Amma ya yi sauri don haka.
I didn’t think it would be that way.	Ban yi tsammanin zai kasance haka ba.
They read it at school.	Suna karanta shi a makaranta.
So it has to be me.	Don haka dole ne ya zama ni.
But no one agreed that they would fix it.	Amma ba wanda ya yarda cewa za su gyara shi.
More often than not.	Sau da yawa kuma.
What they did to the child.	Abin da suka yi wa yaro.
I will change that.	Zan canza hakan.
But this is not a new idea.	Amma wannan ba sabon tunani ba ne.
And there will be police at all times.	Kuma za a sami 'yan sanda a kowane lokaci.
That's fine.	Yayi kyau.
If anyone can, he can.	Idan kowa zai iya, zai iya.
I think you can join.	Ina tsammanin za ku iya shiga.
She was told that.	An gaya mata haka.
I can see why people don’t like it.	Ina iya ganin dalilin da ya sa mutane ba sa son shi.
I'm going to check.	Ina tafiya don duba.
You know who gets it.	Kun san wanda zai samu.
If you will.	Idan za ku zama.
She is still dead.	Ta mutu har yanzu.
No speaker.	Babu mai magana.
In the next year he worked on again.	A cikin shekara ta gaba ya yi aiki a kan kuma .
So we're there, we're moving on, just.	Don haka muna can, muna ci gaba, kawai.
If we refuse, they will kill us.	Idan muka ƙi, za su kashe mu.
He did it tonight.	Ya yi haka a daren yau.
Of course I don't feel that anymore.	Tabbas ba na jin haka kuma.
She could not get any benefit.	Ta kasa samun wani amfani.
Talk about who.	Magana akan wane.
I do not know what to do.	Ban san me zan yi ba.
They were years old.	Sun kasance shekaru.
I can understand everyone.	Zan iya gane kowa da kowa.
He is like a child.	Shi kamar yaro ne.
We really, really agree with you.	Mun gaske, da gaske yarda da ku.
I am here to drink.	Ina nan ina sha.
Here he stops.	Nan ya tsaya.
She is not alive.	Bata bata rai ba.
I'm glad people like it.	Na ji daɗin mutane suna son shi.
It can spend money on fun things.	Zai iya kashe kuɗin a kan abubuwa masu daɗi.
I feel good about it.	Ina jin dadi game da shi.
I am getting very healthy with everyone.	Ina samun lafiya sosai da kowa.
It's just what we need.	Abin da muke bukata ne kawai.
Now go for it.	Yanzu ku tafi da shi.
Looks like rain.	Gani kamar ruwan sama.
It can be described as follows.	Ana iya bayyana shi kamar haka.
I have been trying to work with them for years.	Na kasance ina ƙoƙarin yin aiki da su tsawon shekaru.
I was just crying.	Kuka kawai nake ina kuka.
I want to know.	Ina so in sani.
But we are good at what we do.	Amma muna da kyau a abin da muke yi.
I couldn’t change things and do better for myself.	Ba zan iya canza abubuwa ba kuma in yi wa kaina kyau.
I'll wait.	Zan jira.
He said she would die.	Yace zata mutu.
The work is exciting.	Aikin yana da ban sha'awa.
During that time, many things changed.	A lokacin, abubuwa da yawa sun canza.
So for now, let's end this article here.	Don haka a yanzu, bari mu kawo karshen wannan labarin a nan.
What's this? 	Menene wannan?
At home, at school.	A gida, a makaranta.
I can't find anything.	Ba zan iya samun komai ba.
I don't want to be there.	Ba na son zama a wurin.
At least he took it.	Ko kadan ya dauka yana da.
Some initial meetings may be required.	Ana iya buƙatar wasu taron farko.
I miss.	Na rasa.
And without effort he stopped.	Kuma ba tare da ƙoƙari ba ya tsaya.
She repeated.	Ta sake fad'a.
Are you good at school sports?	Kun yi kyau a wasan makaranta?
Maybe at least she hasn’t seen it.	Watakila ko kadan bata gani ba.
I can't now.	Ba zan iya ba yanzu.
To lose this is to lose everything.	Don rasa wannan shine rasa komai.
No one has ever done this before.	Babu wanda ya taɓa yin wannan a baya.
Perhaps this is expected to happen every day since then.	Wataƙila ana tsammanin hakan zai faru kowace rana tun daga lokacin.
But then he left.	Amma sai ya tafi.
It's hard to say though.	Yana da wuya a ce ko da yake.
This did not happen for a while.	Hakan bai faru na ɗan lokaci ba.
And your name ?.	Kuma sunan ku?.
If you do not want to, go and learn something useful.	Idan ba ka so, tafi ka koyi wani abu mai amfani.
We look forward to seeing you here.	Muna fatan ganin ku a nan.
He just got up and spoke.	Kawai sai ya tashi yayi magana.
Otherwise he did nothing.	In ba haka ba bai yi komai ba.
But he did not stay long at home.	Amma bai dade a gida ba.
This will cost us money.	Wannan zai kashe mu kudi.
There seems to be no way out.	Da alama babu yadda za mu iya biya su.
I have a cold.	Na yi sanyi sosai.
You can not be.	Ba za ku iya zama ba.
Few people work today.	Mutane kaɗan ne ke aiki a yau.
I love her	Ina son ta
There are, however, many disadvantages with this method.	Akwai, duk da haka, da yawa rashin amfani tare da wannan hanya.
I learned a lot more.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa kuma.
Maybe they did.	Wataƙila sun yi.
But we missed that.	Amma mun rasa hakan.
Now this house.	Yanzu wannan gidan.
I will work for you in it.	Zan yi muku aiki a ciki.
You too.	Kai ma .
This cut is a big mistake.	Wannan yanke babban kuskure ne.
I went back downstairs.	Na koma kasa.
Yet who remembers him?	Amma duk da haka wa ya tuna da shi?
They did not want to release him.	Ba su so su sake shi.
No one disagrees.	Babu wanda ya saba.
No need to sit.	Ba a buƙatar zama.
I hope it is, however.	Ina fatan ya kasance, duk da haka.
God will not help you now.	Allah ba zai taimake ka ba a yanzu.
I can't let you pass.	Ba zan iya barin ku ku wuce ba.
Water is a very useful substance.	Ruwa abu ne mai matukar amfani.
It was raining and cold.	An yi ruwan sama da sanyi.
But this man did not.	Amma wannan mutumin bai yi ba.
That person needs to get in the way.	Wannan mutumin yana buƙatar shiga cikin hanya.
It will be difficult to get up when he gets up.	Zai yi wuya a tashi idan ya tashi.
They came back.	Suka dawo.
So we're done.	Don haka mun gama.
I want to talk about you.	Ina so in yi magana game da ku.
It has been several years since my last renovation.	Shekaru da yawa kenan da sake gyara ta na ƙarshe.
No one can enter or leave.	Babu wanda zai shiga ko fita.
Now that I have discovered two things about it.	Yanzu da na gano abubuwa guda biyu game da shi.
No, he was already in the car.	A'a, ya riga ya kasance a cikin mota.
That will not happen.	Hakan ba zai faru ba.
Talk to you soon and keep up the good content.	Sake magana yadda kuke magana da ku, don Allah.
How much is the first.	Nawa ne na farko.
Many people see the truth.	Mutane da yawa suna ganin gaskiya.
I have always been successful.	Na yi nasara a kowane lokaci.
Fortunately, no.	Abin farin ciki, a'a ba haka ba.
They haven’t, but still.	Ba su yi ba, amma har yanzu.
We love them, and they love us.	Muna son su, kuma suna son mu.
I can too.	Zan iya kuma.
You are serious.	Kun kasance da gaske.
Tomorrow night, come.	Gobe ​​da dare, ku zo.
Today, however, the user gets another error.	A yau, duk da haka, mai amfani ya sake samun kuskure.
He had nothing to say to her.	Ba shi da abin da zai ce mata.
Who laughed at him.	Wanda yayi masa dariya.
You may have heard it once or twice in the past.	Wataƙila ka ji sau ɗaya ko sau biyu a baya.
From now on, take care of your well-being.	Daga yanzu, ku kula da jin daɗin ku.
So we are interested.	Don haka muna da sha'awar.
Something went up, though.	Wani abu ya tashi, ko da yake.
It looks like you.	Yana kama da ku.
He tried to kill me, twice.	Ya yi ƙoƙari ya kashe ni, sau biyu.
He just talked about it.	Ya dan yi magana a kan hakan.
It's more than that.	Ya fi haka.
They would have laughed.	Da sun yi dariya.
She knew him, after all.	Ta san shi, bayan haka.
I run until you feel like you can no longer run.	Ina gudu har sai kun ji kamar ba za ku iya ƙara gudu ba.
It will stop if you answer.	Zai tsaya idan kun amsa.
Of course this is a lie.	Tabbas wannan ya zama karya ne.
I don’t want to make this harder than it should be.	Ba na so in sa wannan ya yi wuya fiye da yadda ake bukata.
It goes beyond that.	Ya wuce haka.
And the rest, as they say, are here.	Kuma sauran, kamar yadda suke faɗa, suna nan.
It works the other way around.	Yana aiki da wata hanya kuma.
You have that sense.	Kuna da wannan hankali.
But not necessarily.	Amma ba dole ba.
It's good.	Yana da kyau.
Do your homework now!	Yi aikin gida yanzu!
Many have appeared.	Mutane da yawa sun bayyana.
Good, good, good, good.	Yayi kyau, yayi kyau, wannan yayi kyau.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
I work on it.	Ina aiki a kansa.
It's too much.	Ya yi yawa da yawa.
I felt very sad later.	Na ji bakin ciki sosai daga baya.
It has never been published.	Ba a taɓa buga shi ba.
It's the house.	Yana da gidan.
To say anything about me.	Don in ce komai game da ni.
But, somehow, he does.	Amma, ko ta yaya, yana yi.
That must have been strange to her.	Dole hakan ya zama mata abin ban mamaki.
Which, of course, would not be.	Wanda, ba shakka, ba zai kasance ba.
He appears to be unsure of how to proceed.	Ya bayyana ba ya da tabbas yadda zai yi.
The water level is also good.	Ruwan ruwa ma yayi kyau.
We were in the same school.	Mun kasance a makaranta daya.
We agree that everything is fine.	Mun yarda cewa komai yayi kyau.
Some are good at school.	Wasu suna da kyau a makaranta.
But some things did not add up.	Amma wasu abubuwa ba su kara ba.
It would be nice to have it.	Zai yi kyau a kai.
Life is like being an adult.	Rayuwa kamar kai babban mutum ne.
I don't mind driving.	Ban damu da tuƙi ba.
I'm sure many will enjoy this.	Na tabbata da yawa za su ji daɗin wannan.
We will not leave you.	Ba za mu bar ku ba.
If so, please show me the appropriate way.	Idan haka ne, don Allah a nuna ni ta hanyar da ta dace.
The certainty will never be known.	Ba za a taɓa sanin tabbas ba.
They say this happens more often than not.	Sun ce hakan yana faruwa sau da yawa fiye da yadda ake yi.
It was a good night.	Dare ne mai kyau.
Maybe one day he will try that.	Wataƙila wata rana zai gwada hakan.
I'm very tired now.	Na gaji sosai a yanzu.
It is time to leave.	Lokaci ya yi da zan tashi.
I really want to bring this back.	Ina matukar son a sake kawo wannan.
I plan to come back and stay there one day '.	Na shirya zan dawo in zauna a can wata rana'.
She felt cold.	Ta ji sanyi.
The food is not real, it is funny.	Abincin ba gaskiya bane, abin ban dariya.
I feel calm.	Ina jin a hankali.
You get what you do.	Kuna samun abin da kuke yi.
Or he was killed.	Ko kuma an kashe shi.
Try it and love it, or your money will come back.	Gwada shi kuma ku so shi, ko kuɗin ku ya dawo.
Try as she can, she can't drink it all.	Gwada yadda ta iya, ba za ta iya sha duka ba.
She needs to be alone, she needs time to think.	Tana buƙatar zama ita kaɗai, tana buƙatar lokaci don tunani.
Sometimes, but not often.	Wani lokaci, amma ba sau da yawa ba.
Although.	Ko da yake.
Twice they are removed from us, you see.	Sau biyu ana cire su daga gare mu, kun gani.
Published, published, published.	An buga, buga, buga.
Hopefully that will happen.	Da fatan hakan ya tabbata.
She lives at home now.	Tana zaune a gida yanzu.
It’s delicious every day.	Yana da daɗi kowace rana.
However, no one was honest.	Duk da haka, babu wanda ya kasance mai gaskiya.
You can not leave.	Ba za ku iya barin ba.
And that is now.	Kuma wannan ya kasance a yanzu.
You are here.	Kun kasance a nan.
He fell asleep.	Ya fad'a a zaune.
Do you understand why she did that?	Kun gane dalilin da yasa ta yi haka?
You should stick with what works.	Ya kamata ku tsaya tare da abin da ke aiki.
Once in three, it works like this.	Sau ɗaya cikin uku, yana aiki kamar haka.
It's been done.	An taba yi.
That's her favorite.	Haka ta fi so.
It happens from time to time.	Yana faruwa daga lokaci zuwa lokaci.
You are made for more.	An yi ku don ƙarin.
But now he has been arrested.	Amma yanzu an kama shi.
He has no back and no front.	Ba shi da baya kuma ba shi da gaba.
He doesn't need to do it.	Ba ya buƙatar yin shi.
Amazing though.	Ban mamaki ko da yake.
He would not let anyone think they got it.	Ba zai bari kowa ya yi tunanin sun samu ba.
The project started at lunchtime.	An fara aikin ne a lokacin abincin rana.
I have access to many people.	Ina da damar isa ga mutane da yawa.
Where does he spend his time?	A ina yake samun lokacin?.
And since then things have gone well.	Kuma tun daga lokacin abubuwa sun yi kyau.
They just do.	Suna yi kawai.
The second time he started home.	A karo na biyu ya fara gida.
Tana thought.	Tana tunani.
The festival will close last night.	Bikin zai rufe na daren da ya gabata.
He must have stood his ground.	Lallai ya tsaya kansa.
The time for speech is near.	Lokacin magana ya kusa.
That would be nice.	Wannan zai zama mai dadi.
I told him to stop.	Na ce masa ya daina.
I did this year.	Na yi wannan shekara.
You see through them.	Kuna gani ta hanyar su.
Does this help ?.	Wannan yana taimaka?.
They are huge.	Suna da girma.
She did not and asked if it was necessary.	Ba ta yi ba kuma ta tambayi ko ya zama dole.
I do not mind.	Ban damu ba.
Maybe nothing.	Wataƙila komai.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ba a bayyana abin da za ta iya yi ba.
So is another man.	Haka ma wani mutum.
This is a lie.	Wannan karya ce.
What is he saying?	Me yake cewa?
This is not mine.	Wannan ba nawa bane.
In what appears, let it be seen only.	A cikin abin da ake gani, bari a gani kawai.
And after a week or so, it was.	Kuma bayan mako guda ko fiye da haka, ya kasance.
What happened was what happened.	Abin da ya faru shi ne abin da ya faru.
I would have known you better.	Da na san ku da kyau.
I would never do such a thing.	Ba zan taɓa yin irin wannan abu ba.
We will make the world.	Za mu yi duniya.
This is also the work that has been done in the past.	Wannan kuma shine aikin da aka yi a baya.
They may have happened there in the past, however.	Wataƙila sun faru a can a baya, duk da haka.
What's the matter.	Akwai matsala.
They have done an amazing job so far.	Sun yi aiki mai ban mamaki har zuwa wannan lokacin.
I don't know why she got up.	Ban san dalilin da ya sa ta tashi ba.
Everything looks great now.	Komai yayi kama sosai yanzu.
It was a symbol.	Ya kasance alama ce.
We are tired of traveling.	Mun gaji da tafiya.
Please help me with this problem.	Don Allah a taimake ni da wannan matsalar.
He changed everything.	Ya canza komai.
I remember the last time people came.	Na tuna lokacin ƙarshe da mutane suka zo.
Don't worry.	Kar a damu.
We have no food.	Ba mu da abinci.
But maybe they can do something.	Amma watakila za su iya yin wani abu.
Of course he was.	Tabbas ya kasance.
It seems.	Alama kenan.
Can't wait to hear from you !.	Ba za a iya jira don ji daga gare ku!.
I just want to talk to you.	Ina so in dan yi magana da ku.
I'm sure he'll be back.	Na tabbata zai dawo.
Care must be taken.	Dole ne a tsaya mai da hankali.
We will leave the ship here.	Za mu bar jirgin a nan.
Really great event.	A gaske babban taron.
She felt like she couldn’t walk.	Ta ji kamar ba za ta iya tafiya ba.
First and last and only.	Na farko da na ƙarshe kuma kawai.
That read a third time.	Cewa a karanta a karo na uku.
We all know it won’t work.	Mu duka mun san ba zai yi aiki ba.
Not really.	Ba kamar gaske ba.
Does anyone know how to play? 	Akwai wanda ya san yadda ake wasa?
That is not enough.	Wannan bai isa ba.
He did not hear.	Bata ji ba.
He does not do these things on his own.	Ba ya yin waɗannan abubuwan da kansa.
She doesn't know where to start.	Bata san ta ina zata fara ba.
There is so much to take.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da za a ɗauka.
We have two things for you.	Muna da abubuwa biyu don ku.
She wants to get out, and she wants to get out now.	Tana son fita, kuma tana son fita yanzu.
I never reached that point.	Ban taba kai wannan lokacin ba.
I hope they are.	Ina fata su ne.
It's amazing.	Yana da ban mamaki.
I saved it.	Na ajiye shi.
We think we do not lose much.	Muna tsammanin ba mu rasa da yawa.
I have to kill him.	Dole ne in kashe shi.
It came out amazing.	Ya fito ban mamaki.
Maybe you will hear it.	Wataƙila za ku ji shi.
I came	na zo
Now, the last chance.	Yanzu, dama ta ƙarshe.
But no one can say what other things will happen.	Amma babu wanda zai iya cewa abin da sauran abubuwan za su yi.
I tell you now.	Ina gaya muku yanzu.
She opened the car door.	Ta bude kofar motar.
Sometimes they are killed.	Wani lokaci ana kashe su.
We cannot, however, let them succeed.	Ba za mu iya ba, duk da haka, bari su yi nasara.
She was a real pleasure to work with.	Ta kasance mai jin daɗin aiki da gaske.
They can do a lot now, you see, without killing me.	Za su iya yin yawa yanzu, ka ga, ba tare da kashe ni ba.
But that is not right.	Amma hakan ba daidai ba ne.
So far, this is the happiest experience she has ever had.	Ya zuwa yanzu, wannan ita ce mafi daɗin jin daɗin da ta taɓa samu.
I'll read for a while.	Zan karanta na ɗan lokaci kaɗan.
It was a quick trip, but a success.	Tafiya ce mai sauri, amma nasara.
I think both.	Ina ganin duka.
She was sweet.	Ta kasance mai dadi.
God does not think so.	Allah baya tunanin haka.
He killed a man.	Ya kashe mutum.
Not here, not from her.	Ba a nan ba, ba daga ita ba.
And they are human.	Kuma mutane ne.
She should be at the meeting.	Ya kamata ta kasance a wurin taron.
We must read it.	Dole ne mu karanta shi.
And they don't talk much about it.	Kuma ba su yawan magana game da shi.
However, it does not matter to me.	Duk da haka, ba komai nawa bane.
Now, everything has changed.	Yanzu, komai ya canza.
Some people prefer to be alone.	Wasu mutane sun fi son zama su kaɗai.
They raised their hands.	Suka daga mana hannu.
Buy this dress.	Sayi wannan rigar.
It feels so early.	Yana ji yayi da wuri.
Sometimes one room, still behind, but changed.	Wani lokaci dakin daya, har yanzu a baya, amma ya canza.
Two, three times a week.	Biyu, sau uku a mako.
Today is the day we will win.	Yau ce ranar da za mu ci nasara.
I'll start talking.	Zan fara magana.
Surely that day has come and gone.	Tabbas wannan ranar ta zo kuma ta tafi.
We are more afraid of children.	Mun fi jin tsoro ga yara.
Come what may.	Ku zo abin da zai iya.
It is good here.	Yana da kyau a nan.
I indicate otherwise.	Na nuna ba haka bane.
They enjoy what they see laughing.	Suna jin daɗin abin da suka gani suna dariya.
Is everything alright?	Shin komai yayi kyau?
Or what he failed to do.	Ko abin da ya kasa yi.
I can leave her with something better.	Zan iya barin ta da wani abu mafi kyau.
I want to continue writing this book.	Ina so in ci gaba da rubuta littafin.
His head hurts.	Kansa yayi zafi.
So we know that day has come.	Don haka mun san wannan rana ta zo.
The game, however, is.	Wasan, duk da haka, shine.
No, he went.	A'a, ya tafi.
You are right about me.	Kun yi gaskiya game da ni.
She will read.	Zata yi karatu.
I wonder when it will start.	Ina mamakin yaushe zai fara.
Nice home, comfortable.	Gida mai daɗi, jin daɗi.
I am still not myself.	Har yanzu ba ni da kaina ba.
On the water.	Akan ruwa.
They are the only thing that has not changed.	Su ne kawai abin da bai canza ba.
I am tired	Na gaji
They keep going.	Suna ta tafiya.
Let it hit.	Bari ta buga.
She had no problem with these things before we got married.	Ba ta da matsala da waɗannan abubuwan kafin mu yi aure.
An error cannot occur.	Kuskure ba zai iya faruwa ba.
They understand it properly.	Sun fahimci yadda ya dace.
I still have them.	Har yanzu ina da su.
Otherwise, this is useless.	In ba haka ba, wannan ba shi da amfani.
And you must help me.	Kuma dole ne ku taimake ni.
He had never seen anyone.	Bai taba ganin kowa ba.
Despite this ignorance.	Duk da rashin sani haka.
Use or use.	Yi amfani ko amfani.
This is the next step.	Wannan shi ne ci gaba na gaba.
But she doesn't need that.	Amma ba ta bukatar hakan.
I can’t hope for the best seat.	Ba zan iya fatan mafi kyawun wurin zama ba.
There is nothing to sleep about.	Ba abin da za a yi barci a kai.
It is not an easy thing to carry.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba na ɗaukar kayan.
I don't remember what exactly was.	Ban tuna menene daidai ba.
It will look like something.	Zai yi kama da wani abu.
Sometimes, they pay.	Wani lokaci, sun biya.
I know what he wants me to say.	Na san abin da yake so in ce.
One too sweet.	Daya ma dadi.
This is going to be a very exciting year.	Wannan zai zama shekara mai ban sha'awa sosai.
We will never get it, for one thing.	Ba za mu taɓa samun shi ba, don abu ɗaya.
We bought everything we needed.	Mun sayi duk abin da muke bukata.
Life is much easier.	Rayuwa ta fi sauƙi.
I feel good he is here.	Na ji dadi yana nan.
Maybe he even saved it.	Wataƙila ma ya ajiye shi.
We have so much to do.	Muna da abubuwa da yawa da za mu yi.
I never smoked again.	Na sake taba.
Good time of year and all that.	Kyakkyawan lokacin shekara da duk wannan.
I have so many things to lose.	Ina da abubuwa da yawa da zan rasa.
I have not tried it.	Ban gwada shi ba.
Forget the past, do not worry about the past.	Ka manta da abin da ya gabata, kada ka damu da abin da ya gabata.
I like to think so.	Ina son yin tunani haka.
Read them carefully.	Karanta su a hankali.
No one wants to wear it when someone is injured.	Babu wanda ke son sa idan wani ya ji rauni.
I just said that is not the case.	Kawai na ce ba haka yake faruwa ba.
That turns out to be wrong.	Hakan ya bayyana ba daidai ba ne.
You have to look inside yourself.	Dole ne ku kalli cikin kanku.
But you can't imagine how it was.	Amma ba za ku iya tunanin yadda ta kasance ba.
It is like that.	Kamar haka ne.
Like this man.	Kamar wannan mutumin.
We talked about.	Mun yi magana a kan.
Every game is a success here.	Kowane wasa yana da nasara a nan.
Maybe you can help her?	Wataƙila za ku iya taimaka mata?
I don’t know what to do, but you showed me.	Ban san me zan yi ba, amma kun nuna min.
School is over.	An gama makaranta.
She looked sick, but she did not want to show weakness.	Ta yi kama da rashin lafiya, amma ba ta son nuna rauni.
It's been three years.	Shekara uku kenan.
No food is suitable for everyone.	Babu wani abincin da ya dace da kowa.
They say everything has a beginning and an end.	Sun ce komai yana da farko da kuma ƙarshe.
You will never know what you will get.	Ba za ku taɓa sanin abin da za ku samu ba.
It is never too late to be happy.	Ba a makara don yin farin ciki.
Show on time.	Nuna akan lokaci.
Maybe they even agree.	Wataƙila ma sun yarda da hakan.
I told myself this was a mistake.	Na ce wa kaina wannan kuskure ne.
Now I know that none of these are true.	Yanzu na san cewa babu ɗaya daga cikin waɗannan da ke gaskiya.
They are not in the same place.	Ba wuri guda suke yi ba.
But even that takes years.	Amma ko da hakan yana ɗaukar shekaru.
They can enjoy delicious food.	Suna iya jin daɗin abinci mai daɗi.
We are in the water.	Muna cikin ruwa.
It is a passion that activates.	Sha'awa ce ta kunna.
Of course, she can make mistakes.	Tabbas, tana iya yin kuskure.
More is being added.	Ana ƙara ƙarin.
It hurts, but he wants her to touch him.	Ya yi zafi, amma yana son ta taba shi.
I will fly with you to him.	Zan tashi da kai zuwa gare shi.
Don't be.	Kada ku kasance.
Remember it is true.	Ka tuna cewa gaskiya ne.
You are very intelligent.	Kuna da hankali sosai.
She must have died with him.	Ta mutu tabbas da shi.
I still remember when he left.	Har yanzu ina tuna lokacin da ya tafi.
However, it can happen to anyone.	Duk da haka, yana iya faruwa ga kowa.
He thought so.	Ya yi tsammanin haka.
It is said that he did not know fear.	An ce bai san tsoro ba.
He will never pay me.	Ba zai taba biya ni ba.
Next, just you.	Gaba, kawai ku.
I have to finish my homework quickly!	Dole ne in gama aikin gida da sauri!
But they want that.	Amma suna son hakan.
Sometimes these two things do not go together.	Wani lokaci waɗannan abubuwa biyu ba sa tafiya tare.
We never did that again.	Ba mu sake yin haka ba.
I knew she was gone too.	Na san ita ma ta tafi.
Learn a lot.	Koyi da yawa.
Thus no one will be harmed.	Ta haka babu wanda zai ji rauni.
Maybe a little.	Wataƙila kaɗan ne.
It started to feel like at home.	Ya fara yi kamar a gida.
The winner opened it for him one night.	Wanda yayi nasara ya bude masa dare daya.
No more.	Babu kuma.
I did not think so.	Ban yi tunanin haka ba.
It is not clear whether they really knew.	Ba a bayyana ko da gaske sun sani ba.
It's very interesting.	Yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
Let's move on.	Mu ci gaba.
It was a little weird.	Ya kasance kadan kadan.
If you do not see, you will not believe.	Idan ba ku gani ba, ba za ku yarda ba.
They are tired.	Sun gaji.
But they are gone now.	Amma sun tafi yanzu.
Let's get into it.	Mu shiga shi.
Sure, go over it here.	Tabbas, wuce shi nan.
I don't want to see anyone.	Ba na son ganin kowa.
It is so hot and sunny that it is hard for a person to work.	Yana da zafi da rana wanda da wuya mutum ya iya aiki.
I was too tired to go out much at first.	Na gaji da yawa don fita da yawa da farko.
There is a correct answer.	Akwai amsa daidai.
I know where this is going.	Na san inda wannan ke tafiya.
Give them a chance to see how it works.	Ka ba su dama su ga yadda hakan ke aiki.
A lot more has been discovered since then.	An gano da yawa da yawa tun daga lokacin.
To do something about it.	Don yin wani abu game da shi.
But she returned immediately.	Amma ta koma nan take.
Everything he does goes home from school.	Duk abin da yake yi yana tafiya gida daga makaranta.
We do it honestly.	Muna yin shi da gaskiya.
You can do nothing but keep working.	Ba za ku iya yin komai ba sai ku ci gaba da aiki.
I can not get up.	Ba zan iya tashi ba.
That's what we do.	Abin da muke yi ke nan.
Let's talk about it correctly.	Bari mu yi wannan magana daidai.
For some it comes in handy, not so with others.	Ga wasu yana zuwa cikin sauƙi, ba haka yake da wasu ba.
It's just true.	Gaskiya ce kawai.
He did an amazing job too.	Ya yi aiki mai ban mamaki kuma.
We should do this every year.	Ya kamata mu yi haka kowace shekara.
It gets better and it’s better.	Yana kara kyau kuma yana da kyau.
We do not recognize them.	Ba mu gane su ba.
It's not real work.	Ba aikin gaske bane.
He knew they were useless.	Ya san ba su da amfani.
Nothing.	Babu komai.
Enough writing about sleep.	An isa rubuta game da barci.
It should not go that way.	Bai kamata ya tafi haka ba.
In fact it is not difficult to do.	A gaskiya ba shi da wuya a yi.
I do not know one person.	Ban san mutum daya ba.
This is nothing new.	Wannan kuma ba wani sabon abu ba ne.
This is it.	Wannan shi ne.
This is not the case.	Wannan ba haka bane.
Call them in the afternoon.	Kira su da rana.
And it will.	Kuma zai yi.
Do everything possible to make you feel good.	Yi duk abin da ya kamata don sa ka ji daɗi.
Do not do that.	Kar ku yi hakan.
However, sometimes it is necessary.	Duk da haka, wani lokacin ya zama dole.
Everything is fine.	Komai ya yi kyau.
I can run	Zan iya gudu
I think we will have trouble remembering all this.	Ina tsammanin za mu sami matsala tuna duk wannan.
They take care of that kind of thing.	Suna kula da irin wannan abu.
We found it funny.	Mun sami abin ban dariya.
It felt amazing.	Ya ji ban mamaki.
We are still developing and we continue to work with each other.	Har yanzu muna ci gaba kuma muna ci gaba da aiki da juna.
Anyway you do.	Duk da haka kuna yi.
He never wanted to fight her in the first place.	Bai taba son fada da ita ba tun farko.
They did something.	Wani abu ne suka yi.
Someone has to make that happen.	Dole ne wani ya sa hakan ya faru.
Above me.	Sama da ni.
During lunch, some ate with pleasure.	A lokacin abincin rana, wasu sun ci abinci tare da jin daɗi.
Just to know what to say.	Don kawai su san me za su ce.
Together they helped him.	Tare suka taimake shi.
I was asked to reconsider.	An nemi in kara tunani na kuma.
This is more than just someone sleeping on it.	Wannan ya wuce a ce wani ya kwana a kai.
Even the police felt that way.	Ko ’yan sanda sun ji haka.
Basically, what people heard.	Ainihin, abin da mutane suka ji.
But for a while.	Amma na ɗan lokaci.
We continued walking.	Muka ci gaba da tafiya.
Do things for the needy.	Yi abubuwa ga masu bukata.
He knows there is nothing you can do but kill him.	Ya san ba abin da kuke so sai ku kashe shi.
I have to look and tell you.	Dole ne in duba in gaya muku.
It is almost time.	Yana kusa da lokaci.
I helped you get up and sit down.	Na taimake ka ka tashi zaune.
There is a reason for this.	Akwai dalilin hakan.
Prepare for rain.	A shirya don ruwan sama.
After all this work.	Bayan duk wannan aikin.
I know you know how good it is.	Na san ka san yadda ake kyau.
You are beautiful in it.	Kuna da kyau a ciki.
I could not think of how to explain it.	Na kasa tunanin yadda zan bayyana.
You do not need it.	Ba ku buƙatar shi.
I love him	Ina son shi
But it must begin.	Amma dole ne a fara.
If he brings.	Idan ya kawo.
Sometimes it is difficult for you.	Wani lokacin wahala ce ta ku.
They are not good.	Ba su da kyau.
You can do this to me.	Kuna iya yi min wannan.
Help is right.	Taimakon yayi daidai.
There will be no end.	Ba za a yi ƙarshe ba.
I have never seen so much in one place.	Ban taba ganin da yawa a wuri daya ba.
It is worth reading.	Ya dace a karanta.
It comes in handy.	Ya zo cikin sauƙi.
We did things.	Mun yi abubuwa.
No one seems to.	Babu wani da alama.
We did what we were supposed to do.	Mun yi abin da ya kamata mu yi.
Even this, by itself, is not easy.	Ko da wannan, da kansa, ba mai sauƙi ba ne.
Not at the same time, though.	Ba lokaci guda ba, ko da yake.
No extra money.	Ba ƙarin kuɗi ba.
However, they refused.	Duk da haka, sun ƙi yarda.
I could not understand her.	Na kasa gane ta.
I can’t think of a better place to do it.	Ba zan iya tunanin wuri mafi kyau don yin shi ba.
I feel we have it at the moment.	Ina jin muna da shi a wannan lokacin.
Please stay with me, when it comes to that.	Don Allah ku tsaya tare da ni, idan ya zo ga haka.
I want to read the book.	Ina son karanta littafin.
It is still night.	Dare ne har yanzu.
I didn't even look at the others.	Ban ko kallon sauran ba.
I have no idea to go home.	Bani da tunanin tafiya gida.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba haka bane.
We are here.	Muna nan.
Finally, someone is talking to her.	A ƙarshe, wani yana magana da ita.
Big, he does not want to go home to a house where no one is.	Babban, ba ya son zuwa gida zuwa gidan da babu kowa.
If you have something to say, keep it up.	Idan kuna da abin da za ku faɗa, ci gaba da shi.
But no more, man.	Amma ba kuma, mutum.
I did not say much today.	Ban ce da yawa ba yau.
Now, we become them.	Yanzu, mun zama su.
You feel very busy.	Kuna jin aiki sosai .
Yet he never got it.	Duk da haka bai taba samun ba.
The food vendors of the day were closed.	An rufe masu sayar da kayan abinci na ranar.
She never liked that.	Ba ta taba son wannan ba.
She felt somehow.	Ta ji ko ta yaya.
Prepared, of course.	An shirya, ya tabbata.
In fact, very few need to be.	A gaskiya ma, kadan ne ke da bukatar zama.
What they are trying to do to you.	Abin da suke ƙoƙarin yi muku.
It’s hard on all of us.	Yana da wuya a kan mu duka.
And do it.	Kuma yi shi.
This is not the case, however.	Wannan ba haka yake ba, duk da haka.
You want to die with me there.	Kuna so ku mutu tare da ni a can.
They do not know.	Ba su sani ba.
They are real people.	Mutane ne na gaske.
Take these with you.	Ka ɗauki waɗannan tare da kai.
Of course this is not true.	Tabbas wannan ba gaskiya bane.
I think it is very tasty.	Ina tsammanin yana da dadi sosai.
Learn to live with the heat.	Koyi rayuwa da zafi.
We want to know what someone did.	Muna so mu san abin da wanda ya yi.
So many mistakes have to be corrected.	Don haka sai an gyara kuskure da yawa.
I can not tell you.	Ba zan iya gaya muku ba.
Do you think they can hear us?	Kuna tsammanin za su iya jin mu?
He has such a need.	Ya na da irin wannan bukata.
But he wanted to do more quickly.	Amma ya nemi yin yawa da sauri.
The same should be done.	Haka ya kamata a yi aiki.
That is why this entry is necessary.	Shi ya sa wannan shiga ya zama dole.
Something is going on.	Akwai wani abu da ke faruwa.
Everything has changed.	Komai ya canza.
Surprisingly.	Abin mamaki.
As difficult as that can be.	Kamar yadda wuya hakan zai iya zama.
But that did not work out.	Amma hakan bai yi kyau ba.
The previous man died.	Mutumin na baya ya mutu.
Now we get it.	Yanzu mun samu.
But someone is there, fine.	Amma wani yana can, lafiya.
No one was injured.	Babu wanda ya ji rauni.
Now an unknown person has arrested him.	Yanzu wanda ba a san shi ba ya kama shi.
He did not leave me a child.	Bai bar min yaro ba.
So we stopped here.	Don haka muka tsaya a nan.
We looked up.	Mun kalli sama.
They came out of the water.	Sun fita daga ruwa.
I have no reason to lie now.	Bani da dalilin yin karya yanzu.
No one has died before.	Babu wanda ya mutu kafin.
It's really fun.	Abin farin ciki ne da gaske.
I can not protect you.	Ba zan iya kare ku ba.
Maybe I will never go there again.	Wataƙila ba zan sake zuwa wurin ba.
She grew up accustomed to working outdoors.	Ta girma ta saba yin aiki a waje.
Whatever you enjoy, make time for it.	Duk abin da kuke jin daɗi, ba da lokaci don shi.
You see, we are tired.	Ka ga mun gaji.
Also no one spoke to him.	Haka kuma babu wanda ya yi magana da shi.
She just loves people.	Ta kawai son mutane.
I feel a little sick.	Na ji rashin lafiya kadan.
It seemed empty at the time.	Ya zama kamar ba komai a lokacin.
He is still alive and well to this day.	Har yanzu yana da rai da lafiya har zuwa yau.
So don’t expect too much.	Don haka kar ku yi tsammanin da yawa.
There is someone who can help you.	Akwai wanda zai iya taimaka maka.
I saw this great growth.	Na ga wannan girma girma.
The work was awesome.	Aikin ya kasance mai ban tsoro.
I could not care.	Na kasa kula.
I think it is long life.	Ina tsammanin yana da tsawon rai.
I used to say.	Na saba fada.
I saw this.	Na ga wannan.
The first day of school.	Ranar farko ta makaranta.
They did a good job, but it didn't help.	Sun yi aiki mai kyau, amma hakan bai taimaka ba.
Yet no one lives here anymore.	Duk da haka babu wanda ke zaune a nan kuma.
Time is running out.	Lallai lokaci ya wuce zuwa gaba.
She thought of others.	Ta yi tunanin wasu.
One thing, however, is.	Abu daya, duk da haka, shine.
No one remembers.	Babu wanda ya tuna.
Gradually he learned to swim.	A hankali ya koyi yin iyo.
Tell me.	Ka ce da ni.
She showed me where to sit.	Ta nuna min na zauna.
And all this will come out.	Kuma duk wannan zai fito.
She failed, but did not go out.	Ta kasa, amma ba fita.
There are police.	Akwai 'yan sanda.
I don't like it, though.	Ba na son shi, ko da yake.
Too much, maybe.	Da yawa, watakila.
He didn't care.	Bai damu ba.
It is a problem from the beginning to the end.	Matsala ce ta yi yawa tun daga farko har ƙarshe.
This will fix your problem.	Wannan zai gyara matsalar ku.
I spent the night.	Na yi dare.
There is little now.	Akwai kadan yanzu.
I do not know if this is correct or not.	Ban sani ba ko wannan yayi daidai ko.
However, that was not the case.	Duk da haka, hakan bai kasance ba.
He got a great answer.	Ya sami babban amsa.
We must help him.	Dole ne mu taimake shi.
We will arrive.	Za mu isa.
I’m sure it will be very interesting.	Na tabbata da zai kasance mai ban sha'awa sosai.
I hope she knows what she is doing.	Ina fatan ta san abin da take yi.
I am happy about that.	Na yi farin ciki da hakan.
I looked closer.	Na duba kusa.
So everyone has access to it.	Don haka kowa yana da damar yin amfani da shi.
I think there is a reason for that.	Ina tsammanin akwai dalilin hakan.
They are in this article.	Suna cikin wannan labarin.
Honestly don't think you do but you think.	Gaskiya kar ku yi tunanin kuna yi amma kuna tunani.
Which is.	Wanda shine.
We know it.	Mun san shi.
Maybe people will die.	Wataƙila mutane za su mutu.
Trying to make a mistake.	Ƙoƙarin ya yi kuskure.
This is more than he thought.	Wannan ya fi yadda yake tunani.
I did not have to come close to reading it.	Ba sai na yi kusa da ni in karanta shi ba.
He decided to go.	Ya yanke shawarar tafiya.
We do not eat this!	Ba mu cin wannan!
I will not do it.	Ba zan yi ba.
But that is not the case.	Amma ba haka abin yake ba.
How to lose so.	Yadda aka rasa haka.
You can break it.	Kuna iya karya shi.
Often two will try to print it at the same time.	Sau da yawa biyu za su yi ƙoƙarin buga shi lokaci ɗaya.
I got some money saved.	Na sami wasu kuɗi da aka ajiye.
Break both of you.	Karya ku biyu.
It doesn't seem to matter much.	Da alama bata da yawa.
I'm talking about it.	Ina magana game da shi.
You want to do everything very well.	Kuna son yin komai da kyau sosai.
This coffee tastes really good to me.	Wannan kofi yayi min dadi sosai.
You need to be careful.	Kuna buƙatar yin hankali.
One day he asked her about it.	Wata rana ya tambaye ta game da hakan.
They looked for a place to sleep.	Suka nemi wurin kwana.
Just let him talk to me.	Kawai bari yayi min magana.
Of course, there is no way to know for sure.	Tabbas, babu yadda za a iya sanin tabbas.
This flight is working fine.	Wannan jirgin yana aiki lafiya.
I care.	Na kula.
You can expect such a project.	Kuna iya tsammanin irin wannan aikin.
Of course.	Ya tabbata.
You have, of course.	Kuna da, ba shakka.
But not everyone really.	Amma ba kowa da gaske.
This is a beautiful place to sleep.	Wannan kyakkyawan wurin kwana ne.
How much more so.	Nawa ma ya fi haka.
That's what happened.	Abin da ya faru kenan.
He is not a little afraid of me.	Ba ya dan tsoro na.
This is not true.	Wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
No one knows for sure why these things happen.	Babu wanda ya san tabbas dalilin da ya sa waɗannan abubuwan suke faruwa.
You see it works.	Kun ga yana aiki.
Travel is great.	Tafiya yana da kyau.
You just can't expect success this way.	Kawai ba za ku iya tsammanin samun nasara ta wannan hanyar ba.
Still working on it.	Har yanzu aiki a kai.
He is the one who was "cut off" for us.	Shi ne aka yi mana "yanke".
It works for me.	Yana yi mini aiki.
I know what the problem is!	Na san menene matsalar!
I will more than agree if that is true.	Zan ƙara yarda idan hakan gaskiya ne.
It's very interesting.	Yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
I'll show you around.	Zan nuna muku a kusa.
He’s not scared, right.	Bai ji tsoro ba, daidai.
She left that.	Ta bar wannan.
I was afraid that said nothing.	Na ji tsoron cewa komai.
I really like the way they tell the story.	Ina matukar son yadda suke ba da labarin.
Take the book with you.	Ɗauki littafin tare da ku.
Explain exactly what you really want.	Bayyana ainihin abin da kuke so da gaske.
She talked to me all night.	Ta yi min magana tsawon dare.
He did not know himself.	Bai san kansa ba.
They used to blame each other.	Sun kasance suna zargin juna.
You just have to try it.	Dole ne ku gwada shi kawai.
It's hard at that.	Yana da wuya a haka.
If anyone can tell me, that would be nice.	Idan wani zai iya gaya mani, hakan zai yi kyau.
I love her	Ina son ta
It was more than we were at the time.	Ya kasance fiye da cewa mun kasance a lokacin.
Others think so.	Wasu kuma suna tunanin haka.
I think it will be very hot.	Ina tsammanin zai yi zafi sosai.
There will be no good end.	Ba za a sami kyakkyawan ƙarshe ba.
They broke the world.	Sun karya duniya.
We have to talk.	Dole ne mu yi magana.
He will not return for a while.	Ba zai dawo ba na ɗan lokaci.
She opened the door.	Ta bude kofar.
He likes to think for himself.	Haka yake son tunanin kansa.
And it will work fine.	Kuma zai yi aiki lafiya.
He stopped eating fish.	Ya daina cin kifi.
He did not know what to say.	Bai gane abin da ya kamata ya fada ba.
Women are still used.	Har yanzu ana amfani da mata.
The work was difficult for him.	Aikin ya yi masa wuya.
It is not the same as desired.	Ba daidai yake da yadda ake so ba.
I used to love it.	Na kasance ina son shi.
Another train left the station.	Wani jirgin kasa ya bar tashar.
Until you turn it on.	Har sai kun kunna shi.
It's time to talk.	Lokacin magana yayi.
It is better to come early.	Yana da kyau a zo da wuri.
They are not really doing anything.	Ba su yin wani abu da gaske.
And he made it happen.	Kuma ya sanya ya faru.
Whatever they did to her.	Duk abin da suka yi mata.
They have known each other for years.	Sun san juna tsawon shekaru.
Maybe they missed something.	Wataƙila sun rasa wani abu.
Little by little.	Kaɗan kaɗan.
I am always wrong.	Kullum ni ne ke cikin kuskure.
After that, we continued our journey.	Bayan haka, muna ci gaba da tafiya.
I was surprised.	Na yi mamaki.
I like the way it looks.	Ina son yadda yake kama.
The world is not scary.	Duniya ba ta da ban tsoro.
Everyone is working on the same thing.	Kowa yana aiki akan abu ɗaya.
She told me everything.	Ta gaya min komai.
We will review it and get back to you.	Za mu sake duba shi kuma mu dawo gare ku.
Do not lie.	Kar a yi karya.
They can be made now though.	Za a iya yin su a yanzu ko da yake.
No one went there that day.	Ba wanda ya je wurin a ranar.
He confirmed the story.	Ya tabbatar da labarin.
She does not come out, she enters.	Bata fito ba, tana shiga.
He feels like he is the owner.	Yana jin kamar shi mai shi ne.
Let's keep going.	Mu ci gaba da tafiya.
We do not know what to do.	Ba mu san abin da za mu yi ba.
Not safe here.	Ba lafiya a nan.
This she knows.	Wannan ta sani.
Much progress has been made.	An samu ci gaba da yawa.
I know we can do it.	Na san za mu iya yi.
You know it when you hear it.	Ka san shi idan ka ji shi.
It is the only thing to do now.	Shi ne kawai abin yi a yanzu.
You keep telling me you came alive.	Kuna ci gaba da gaya mani kun zo da rai.
She killed a man.	Ta kashe mutum.
This will be the last.	Wannan zai zama na ƙarshe.
We have to go there.	Dole ne mu je can.
Selfish person.	Son kai mutum.
He must have been very sick.	Babu shakka ya yi rashin lafiya sosai.
But over time it became clear that they were serious.	Amma bayan lokaci ya bayyana cewa sun kasance da gaske.
Of course she has to.	Tabbas dole ta yi.
There is no way to make a child.	Ba yadda za a yi yaro ya kasance.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Babu komai a kan hakan.
He quickly stopped walking.	Da sauri ya daina tafiya.
She didn’t live a good life, even though she was.	Ba ta yi rayuwa mai kyau ba, ko da yake ta kasance.
People are intelligent.	Mutane suna da hankali.
I have to go back to work.	Dole ne in koma aiki.
But no.	Amma babu.
It will be very close.	Zai kasance kusa sosai.
God loves us.	Allah yana son mu.
Everything is going well.	Komai yana tafiya daidai.
He did.	Hakan yayi.
They will not do what they say they will do.	Ba za su yi abin da suka ce za su yi ba.
Give or take a year.	Ba da ko ɗaukar shekara guda.
I think you will enjoy it.	Ina tsammanin za ku ji daɗi.
I was there and did that.	Na kasance a can kuma yi haka.
This has been a year.	Wannan ya zama shekara.
However, this does not work.	Duk da haka, wannan ba ya aiki.
Gradually I lost my sight.	A hankali na rasa gani na.
You do not have to fix everything.	Ba lallai ne ku gyara komai ba.
You cannot be anything to anyone.	Ba za ku iya zama komai ga kowa ba.
Which did not do me any good.	Wanda bai yi min kyau ba.
I can't change that.	Ba zan iya canza hakan ba.
It will be very useful.	Zai zama da amfani sosai.
He wrote the film.	Ya rubuta fim.
No one told him to do it.	Ba wanda ya ce masa ya yi haka.
I can't give them away now.	Ba zan iya ba su yanzu.
Maybe not as much as we would like, but still.	Wataƙila ba yadda za mu so ba, amma har yanzu.
It is enough to ask for dinner.	Yana isa ya nemi a kawo abincin dare.
Everything here has become much bigger.	Komai a nan ya zama ya fi girma girma.
She knew he did.	Ta san ya yi.
And we all know where that will lead.	Kuma duk mun san inda hakan zai kai ga.
It was time for me to be on my own.	Lokaci ya yi da zan kasance da kaina.
My job is open.	Aiki na a bude yake.
You have been for a long time.	Kun dade da yawa.
You are the best.	Ke ce mafi kyau duka.
I could not get out because of the rain.	Na kasa fita saboda ruwan sama.
This is too hot.	Wannan yayi zafi sosai.
You cannot succeed.	Ba za ku iya yin nasara ba.
We even found a book to use.	Har ma mun sami littafin da za mu yi amfani da shi.
Plan to get out there.	Yi shirin fita a wurin.
She was not killed.	Ba a kashe ta ba.
But that's enough.	Amma ya isa haka.
I knew it was going to rain.	Na san za a yi ruwan sama.
I'll let him swim.	Zan bar shi ya yi iyo.
He appears to be right.	Ya bayyana yana da gaskiya.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
I used it for a while.	Na yi amfani da shi na ɗan lokaci.
It should be simple.	Ya kamata ya zama mai sauƙi.
It can be anyone.	Zai iya zama kowa.
Nothing new.	Babu wani sabon abu kuma.
He did not get it.	Bai samu ba.
In the morning, there were only three of us.	Da safe, mu uku ne kawai.
She could not speak or feel well.	Ba ta iya magana ko ji da kyau.
Three people.	Mutane uku.
He must show you three.	Lallai ya nuna muku ku uku.
Maybe you enjoyed hearing that.	Wataƙila kun ji daɗin jin haka.
This is your first movie.	Wannan shine fim ɗin ku na farko.
It makes me interested.	Yana sa ni sha'awar.
Everything else should be.	Duk sauran abin da ya kamata ya kasance.
We lost it twice.	Mun rasa shi sau biyu.
It has a boat waiting outside.	Yana da jirgin ruwa yana jira a waje.
I can't explain why.	Ba zan iya bayyana dalilin ba.
It seems a lot, what they have.	Ga alama da yawa, abin da suke da shi.
Do it.	Shin shi.
My coffee is cold.	Kofi na ya yi sanyi.
I cut this off.	Na yanke wannan.
That leaves only one.	Wannan ya bar daya kawai.
Still wrong.	Har yanzu ba daidai ba.
And he is alone.	Kuma shi kadai ne.
That should be sufficient enough.	Hakan ya isa lafiya.
It has never been properly cut.	Ba a taɓa yanke shi da kyau ba.
You'll get there, one day, but start small.	Za ku isa can, wata rana, amma fara kadan.
We have to go out and change.	Dole ne mu fita mu canza.
We wanted to see where it took us.	Mun so mu ga inda ya kai mu.
Maybe I didn’t want to know.	Wataƙila ban so in sani ba.
I don't believe he wants to do this.	Ban yarda ko yana son yin wannan ba.
That has to stop, she told him.	Wannan dole ya tsaya, ta gaya masa.
Now she is convinced of that.	Yanzu ta tabbata a kan hakan.
Not too much.	Ba ma da yawa.
So you need to fight.	Don haka kuna buƙatar fada.
Explain why.	Bayyana dalilin da yasa.
Well, more than ever in a while.	Da kyau, fiye da kowane lokaci a cikin ɗan lokaci.
We don't need them.	Ba ma bukatar su.
But he was wrong.	Amma yayi kuskure.
I felt uncomfortable with him.	Na ji ba dadi gare shi.
I am close to you.	Ina nan kusa da ku.
That is how the decision was made.	Haka aka yanke wannan shawarar.
I thought we missed you.	Na dauka mun rasa ku.
They are not afraid.	Ba mu tsoro.
She said.	Ta fad'a.
It will keep you cool on a hot day.	Zai sanya ku sanyi a rana mai zafi.
I said come on.	Na ce ka zo.
It may rain tomorrow.	Ana iya yin ruwan sama gobe.
The money is needed.	Ana buƙatar kuɗin.
No one is in his head there.	Wani ba ya cikin kansa a can.
More children than ever.	Yara fiye da kowane lokaci.
If and when we take too much, we are good.	Idan kuma lokacin da muka ɗauka da yawa, muna da kyau.
It can be done as follows.	Ana iya yin haka kamar haka.
They said there was little at the venue.	Sun ce kadan ne a wurin taron.
This has happened many times now.	Wannan ya faru sau da yawa yanzu.
Few people	Kadan mutane
I think they are really funny.	Ina tsammanin suna da ban dariya da gaske.
Buy and enjoy.	Saya ku ji daɗi.
You can make a lot of money.	Kuna iya samun kuɗi da yawa.
He has not forgotten us.	Bai manta da mu ba.
Tell them to come.	Ka ce su zo.
It just got better.	Kawai sai ya kara kyau.
A lot, though.	Da yawa, ko da.
That's one of those things.	Daya daga cikin abubuwan kenan.
But the world is beyond oil.	Amma duniya ta wuce mai.
He should not have brought her here.	Bai kamata ya kawo ta nan ba.
I got well with it.	Na samu lafiya da shi.
He was alone.	Ya kasance shi kaɗai.
You want me to open this door.	Kuna so in bude wannan kofar.
Nor did they progress.	Haka kuma ba su ci gaba ba.
Whoever wins, is on the people.	Duk wanda ya ci nasara, yana kan mutane.
Did you know.	Shin kun sani.
So that's what he wants to do.	Don haka abin da yake so ya yi ke nan.
Run what they have.	Gudu da abin da suke da shi.
I know exactly where everyone is.	Na san sosai inda kowa yake.
I've never been here.	Ban taba nan ba.
You like it.	Kuna son shi.
I would like to.	Ina so.
That's what he said to me.	Abin da ya ce da ni ke nan.
I think it's right.	Ina ganin daidai ne.
So you always wear them.	Don haka kuna sa su koyaushe .
He should not worry.	Bai kamata ya damu ba.
No one knows where she went or why.	Ba wanda ya san inda ta tafi ko kuma dalilin da ya sa.
Let them hear it.	Su ji su.
The need has been met with little success.	Buƙatar ta yi nasara kaɗan kaɗan kawai.
He got tired and got out of the car.	Ya gaji ya fito daga motar.
I passed there.	Na wuce can.
Good night.	Bar dare.
I don't feel that anymore.	Ba na jin haka kuma.
Only two.	Biyu kawai.
So he will look and wait for another chance.	Don haka zai duba ya jira wata dama.
We all know where we need to go.	Mu duka mun san inda muke bukatar zuwa.
Let's not forget it.	Kada mu manta da shi.
I am not like that.	Ni ba haka nake ba.
They did this time.	Sun yi wannan lokacin.
I would have told you sooner.	Da na gaya muku da wuri.
Maybe the respondent will like it exactly as you wrote it.	Wataƙila mai ba da amsa zai so shi daidai kamar yadda kuka rubuta.
Not comfortable.	Ba dadi.
No one is there.	Babu kowa a wurin.
I am alone.	Ni kadai.
It can be repaired in person.	Akwai damar gyara shi da mutum.
I'm not dead, it seems.	Ban mutu ba, da alama.
I hope he enjoys it.	Ina fatan ya ji daɗi.
There were two other people there.	Akwai wasu mutane biyu a wurin.
If true it is a lot of money.	Idan gaskiya ne kudi ne mai yawa.
He wanted us to know him.	Ya so mu san shi.
It so happened that today is such a day.	Haka ya faru cewa yau irin wannan rana ce.
See what happens.	Kalli abin da ke faruwa.
We are glad to see you.	Mun yi farin cikin ganin ku.
We go along well.	Muna tafiya tare da kyau.
He didn't think much of it.	Bai yi tunani sosai game da wannan ba.
I can see that happening.	Ina iya ganin hakan yana faruwa.
I put on a new train at this station and it went empty.	Na sanya sabon jirgin kasa a wannan tashar kuma ya tafi babu kowa.
Besides, you told us things we didn't know before.	Ban da haka, kun gaya mana abubuwan da ba mu sani ba a da.
But it must have caught me.	Amma tabbas ya kama ni.
It's very interesting.	Yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
But it is something else.	Amma wani abu ne.
Money is not a thing.	Kudi ba abu bane.
There was a terrible noise.	An yi wata ƙara mai ban tsoro.
You do.	Kun yi .
I got this.	Na samu wannan.
But without it.	Amma ba tare da ita ba.
But we must seize the opportunity.	Amma dole ne mu yi amfani da damar.
Things can go wrong.	Abubuwa na iya yin kuskure.
I thought it would be really hard, but it wasn’t.	Ina tsammanin zai yi wahala da gaske, amma ba haka ba.
Something else is going on.	Akwai wani abin da ya kara faruwa.
I killed him.	Na kashe shi.
He knows her.	Ya san ta.
One cold day, another.	Wata rana sanyi, rana.
This is a focus.	Wannan yana mai da hankali ne.
Not me anymore.	Ba ni ba kuma.
He said it was time.	Yace lokaci yayi.
I care about you.	Na damu da kai.
Don't worry about me.	Kada ku damu da ni.
Sweet skin.	Fata mai dadi.
I want to hear what it is, not what it is.	Ina so in ji abin da yake, ba abin da ba.
I just want to wait for you.	Ina so kawai in jira ku.
That surprised me.	Hakan ya zama mini ban mamaki.
He took advantage of this opportunity.	Ya yi amfani da wannan damar.
I totally agree with what you said.	Na yarda gaba ɗaya da abin da kuka faɗa.
One quick thing though.	Abu daya mai sauri ko da yake.
Just stop.	Ka daina kawai.
And, well it shouldn’t.	Kuma, da kyau bai kamata ba.
I want to hear this guy talk.	Ina son jin wannan mutumin yana magana.
They certainly did not kill him.	Lallai ba su kashe shi ba.
We passed the heat.	Mun wuce zafi.
Of course it can be.	Tabbas yana iya zama.
Please stop doing that.	Da fatan za a daina yin hakan.
She could not wait to return home.	Ta kasa jira ta koma gida.
I think you have to be there.	Ina tsammanin dole ne ku kasance a wurin.
I do not feel we can ask for more.	Ba na jin za mu iya neman ƙarin.
Life is very good.	Rayuwa ta yi kyau sosai.
Stop and turn it on.	Tsaya kuma kunna shi.
This is a real opportunity.	Wannan dama ce ta gaske.
They just hope it doesn't happen.	Don kawai suna fatan hakan ba zai sa hakan ya faru ba.
It has never happened before.	Bai taba faruwa a baya ba.
It may be right for you.	Yana iya zama daidai da ku.
No one wants to hear that.	Ba wanda yake son jin haka.
But some are afraid.	Amma wasu suna tsoro.
I know something is wrong.	Na san wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
She doesn't need me.	Ba ta bukata na.
But we need to be careful, and right now.	Amma muna bukatar mu mai da hankali, kuma a yanzu.
Let's wait and see.	Mu jira mu ga yadda take.
We must do it.	Dole ne mu yi hakan.
The room is empty.	Dakin babu kowa.
A new time for both of us.	Wani sabon lokaci ga mu biyu.
We only travel together because we will not go with anyone.	Muna tafiya tare ne kawai saboda ba za mu tafi tare da kowa ba.
If you do not want to, you do not live.	Idan ba ka so, ba ka rayuwa.
I did what needed to be done.	Na yi abin da ake bukata don yi.
I think a lot of people were.	Ina tsammanin mutane da yawa sun kasance.
We know we can do better than that.	Mun san za mu iya yin abin da ya fi haka.
One year is enough.	Shekara daya ta isa.
We do not need that.	Ba ma bukatar hakan.
And, we can give life.	Kuma, za mu iya ba da rai.
Man, good.	Mutum, yayi kyau.
When they opened, they stopped.	Da suka bude suka tsaya.
Some even in the past.	Wasu ma a baya.
The person must be tested.	Dole ne a gwada mutumin.
The whole thing seemed awkward.	Gaba d'aya gaba d'aya ta yi kamar ba dadi.
Two things stand out.	Abubuwa biyu sun tsaya a waje.
But he has nowhere to go.	Amma babu inda zai je.
There is nothing there, of course.	Babu komai a wurin, ba shakka.
Maybe that would be better.	Wataƙila hakan zai fi kyau.
We can not continue to live together.	Ba za mu iya ci gaba da zama tare ba.
She will love this.	Za ta so wannan.
Get out of here and sleep.	Fita daga nan ku yi barci.
I don't want to look.	Ban so in duba.
That doesn't help much.	Hakan baya taimaka mana da yawa.
So everything went.	Don haka komai ya tafi.
One day it was like a moon.	Wata rana ta kasance kamar wata.
We don't have to fight.	Ba sai mun yi fada ba.
That's right.	A haka yake.
It’s a movie, but it’s real.	Shi fim ne, amma tana da gaske.
It's me.	Ni kaina.
I'm leaving now.	Zan fita yanzu.
None of this really.	Babu ɗaya daga cikin wannan da gaske.
You will make people happy.	Za ku yi farin ciki mutane.
It feels amazing when a song can do that.	Yana jin ban mamaki lokacin da waƙa za ta iya yin hakan.
I have to get used to it.	Dole ne in saba da hakan.
But this is the last chance.	Amma wannan ita ce dama ta ƙarshe.
After the meal she lit a cigarette.	Bayan an gama cin abinci sai ta kunna taba.
Maybe they were outside.	Wataƙila sun kasance a waje.
But there is.	Amma akwai.
It's not very good.	Ba shi da kyau sosai.
But he did not understand.	Amma bai gane ba.
It's just my right.	Dama ce kawai na.
I hope she gets it.	Ina fatan ta samu.
We were all so excited about it.	Mu duka mun yi farin ciki sosai game da shi.
I will stay.	Zan tsaya.
They seem to belong to one place, to another.	Sun zama kamar na wani waje ne, na wani.
But there can be many.	Amma ana iya samun su da yawa.
About each of these.	Game da kowane daga cikin wannan.
This is very good.	Wannan yayi kyau sosai.
He will go with you.	Zai tafi tare da ku.
Of course he went again.	Tabbas ya sake tafiya.
The game was good.	Wasan ya yi kyau.
I know you.	Na san ku.
It just didn’t.	Sai kawai bai yi ba.
He hopes they are not dead.	Ya yi fatan ba su mutu ba.
Something is not working.	Wani abu baya aiki.
The reading is just amazing.	Karatu ne kawai mai ban mamaki.
No one agrees with them.	Babu wanda ya yarda da su.
Someone did, of course.	Wani ya yi, tabbas.
That would be one.	Wanda zai zama daya.
I win.	Ina cin nasara.
But this is not the only time it has happened.	Amma ba wannan ne kawai lokacin da abin ya faru ba.
He is worried.	Ya damu.
Maybe he should just keep getting one.	Wataƙila ya kamata kawai ya ci gaba da samun ɗaya.
Now we can live.	Yanzu za mu iya rayuwa.
I don't mind doing that.	Ban damu da yin haka ba.
We are so scared, we are afraid of losing you.	Mun ji tsoro sosai, muna jin tsoron rasa ku.
I have never heard of it.	Ban taba jin labarin ba.
Everything is happy and successful.	Duk abin farin ciki ne da nasara.
Both things are in time.	Abubuwan biyu suna cikin lokaci.
I stopped thinking.	Na daina tunani.
Of course it is not an easy task.	Tabbas ba abu ne mai sauƙi ba.
It's on the house for you.	Yana kan gidan a gare ku.
He walks hand in hand.	Yana tafiya hannu da hannu.
Some will be ready soon, and others will be ready later.	Wasu za su shirya nan da nan, wasu kuma za su shirya daga baya.
But sleep did not come.	Amma barci bai zo ba.
Kill him you will be safe.	Kashe shi za ku kasance lafiya.
I can’t tell him well, though.	Ba zan iya gaya masa da kyau ba, ko da yake.
I work.	Na aikin.
They just have to sit there and hate it.	Sai kawai su zauna a can su ƙi shi.
Let me go! 	Bari in tafi!
he thought.	yayi tunani.
It was raining.	Ruwan sama ne ya kama shi.
They run outside a little.	Suna gudu a waje kadan.
I hated this game.	Na ƙi wannan wasan.
And we don't want to.	Kuma ba ma so.
Maybe he did.	Wataƙila ya yi.
He was a kid, after all.	Shi yaro ne, bayan haka.
I did so.	Na yi haka.
No no no no.	Ba ba ba ba ba babu.
It still has something to prove.	Har yanzu yana da abin da zai tabbatar.
No need for it.	Babu bukatar shi.
But the problem did not go away.	Amma matsalar da ake ciki ba ta tafi ba.
We will get that later.	Za mu samu hakan daga baya.
The world is safe.	Duniya tana lafiya.
And then.	Sai me.
I kept it in check.	Na ajiye shi a duba.
We know people.	Mun san mutane.
Show that you can get a job.	Nuna cewa za ku iya samun aikin yi.
On his own.	A kansa.
She is not dead but sleeping '.	Ba ta mutu ba amma tana barci'.
But you know what happened.	Amma kun san abin da ya faru.
Be careful not to cut yourself.	Yi hankali kada ku yanke kanku.
Events every day.	Abubuwan da ke faruwa kowace rana.
Which will only be used for beauty.	Wanda za a yi amfani da shi kawai don kyau.
For those who are interested in reading, there is nothing more enjoyable.	Ga masu sha'awar karatu, babu abin da ya fi jin daɗi.
They could not.	Ba su iya ba.
But, we will see.	Amma, za mu gani.
It will reappear, but not often.	Zai sake bayyana, amma ba sau da yawa ba.
It will give him more time.	Zai kara masa lokaci.
You are beautiful.	Kuna da kyau.
He knew you had them.	Da ya gane kana da su.
The man looked thoughtful.	Mutumin ya duba mai tunani.
No problem.	Ba matsala.
A new run back.	Wani sabon gudu baya.
He is doing himself a favor.	Yana yi wa kansa kyau.
No one will help you.	Babu wanda zai taimake ku.
Maybe you are wrong.	Wataƙila kuna kuskure.
Play with the kids.	Yi wasa da yara.
Do not write anything.	Kar a rubuta komai.
Somehow he will die.	Ko yaya zai mutu.
She didn't know if she would even know how to do it.	Ba ta sani ba ko za ta ma san yadda za ta yi.
Use yourself.	Yi amfani da kan ku.
Mark a little.	Yi alama kaɗan.
There is still no answer.	Har yanzu babu amsa.
There is not much to say about it.	Ba wani abu da yawa da za a ce game da shi.
They do not work.	Ba sa aiki.
They do not want to think about it.	Ba sa son yin tunani a kan hakan.
Now is not the time to do all this again.	Yanzu ba lokaci ba ne da za a sake yin wannan duka.
He has to do it whether he likes it or not.	Dole ne ya yi ko ya so ko bai so.
Nothing wants more.	Babu wani abu da yake so fiye.
Nothing to answer.	Ba komai ta amsa.
She studied for over a month.	Ta yi karatu na sama da wata guda.
We are good together.	Muna da kyau tare.
God has been like that for a long time.	Allah ya dade da haka.
Great, and you're good to go.	Babban, kuma kun yi kyau.
I came slowly.	Na zo a hankali.
It works fine.	Yana aiki daidai.
Maybe you should pay attention.	Wataƙila ya kamata ku kula.
God is tired.	Allah ya gaji.
She says it's both.	Ta ce duka biyu ne.
He recognized it.	Ya gane shi.
Close but not enough.	Kusa amma bai isa ba.
I do not even smoke.	Ba na ma shan taba.
I hope they do not.	Ina fata ba su yi ba.
And now to bring it back.	Kuma yanzu don dawo da shi.
It's a cool job.	Aiki ne mai sanyi.
The method is good.	Hanyar tana da kyau.
I do not really.	Bani da gaske.
I'm not feeling well.	Ban ji dadi ba.
We don't have anyone who can finish the game right now.	Ba mu da wanda zai iya gama wasan a yanzu.
I am in the port	Ina cikin tashar ruwa
It's good, it feels good.	Yayi kyau, yana jin dadi.
I hope you enjoyed reading it.	Ina fatan kun ji daɗin karanta shi.
Of the person she loves.	Na mutumin da take so.
All they have is money.	Duk abin da suke da shi shine kudi.
I will catch the next train.	Zan kama jirgin kasa na gaba.
She has never failed us.	Ba ta taba kasa mu ba.
Obviously, he was not in it for the money.	Babu shakka, bai kasance a ciki don kuɗin ba.
When he arrived, something was killed.	Lokacin da ya isa, an kashe wani abu.
So they think.	Don haka suke tunani.
Be in this !.	Kasance cikin wannan!.
The problem is here.	Matsalar tana nan.
It will be all.	Zai kasance duka .
But it seems to be very weak.	Amma da alama ya yi rauni sosai.
Plan a good time for your event.	Shirya lokacin da kyau don taron ku.
No one should learn through heat.	Babu wanda ya kamata ya koyi ta hanyar zafi.
Others will.	Sauran kuma za su yi.
Exactly like each other.	Daidai kamar juna.
All of the first ones are good.	Duk na farko suna da kyau.
Mark, with me.	Yi alama, tare da ni.
No one will do that to you.	Babu wanda zai yi maka haka.
You must help us to help you.	Dole ne ku taimake mu mu taimake ku.
One has to bring oneself to the task.	Dole ne mutum ya kawo kansa ga aikin.
However, the world remains waiting.	Duk da haka, duniya ta zauna tana jira.
It's a problem, it's a real problem.	Matsala ce, matsala ce ta gaske.
Doing this twice will prove easy.	Yin wannan sau biyu zai tabbatar da sauƙi.
Why did they do that.	Me yasa suka yi hakan.
One may want it again at night.	Mutum na iya sake so a cikin dare.
She has been there for a year now.	Ta kasance a can shekara guda yanzu.
It's amazing, really.	Abin mamaki ne, da gaske.
But that, too, is good.	Amma wannan ma, yayi kyau.
This weekend seemed like the right time.	Wannan karshen mako ya yi kama da lokacin da ya dace.
He could not take it.	Ya kasa dauka.
The tools are there.	Kayan aikin suna can.
She has no plans today.	Ba ta da shirin yau.
However, sorry for the inconvenience, everyone.	Duk da haka, hakuri da matsala, kowa da kowa.
It didn't take long.	Bai dade ba.
Things are moving fast now.	Abubuwa na tafiya da sauri yanzu.
He does these things really easily.	Yana yin waɗannan abubuwan da gaske cikin sauƙi.
So this should not be included in this.	Don haka bai kamata a saka wannan a cikin wannan ba.
You are arrested.	Ana kama ku.
He does not want to be touched.	Ba ya so a taba shi.
He said he was not paid what he deserved.	Ya ce ba a biya shi abin da ya dace.
I learned a lot about it.	Na koyi abubuwa da yawa a kai.
In the morning they leave home for breakfast.	Da safe suke barin gida don cin abincin safe.
And yes, we did enjoy it.	Kuma a, mun yi ɗan daɗi da shi.
Everything is just a lie.	Duk abin ya zama karya kawai.
He loves you what you love yourself.	Yana son ku abin da kuke so da kanku.
Did you finish?	Kun gama?
I'm not happy about that.	Ban yi farin ciki da hakan ba.
Let's see!	Sai mu gani!.
They’ve been two or three days in the past, though.	Sun yi kwana biyu ko uku a baya, ko da yake.
You will wait and see.	Za ku jira ku gani.
However, she realized that she had found water.	Duk da haka, ta gane cewa ta sami ruwa.
He studied hard for three years.	Yayi karatu sosai har tsawon shekaru uku.
Next up.	Gaba ya tashi.
They came to me.	Sun zo gare ni.
It was a beautiful place.	Ya kasance kyakkyawan wuri.
Give her one last chance.	Ka ba ta dama ta ƙarshe.
It worked.	Yayi aiki.
Now there is no need to run fast.	Yanzu babu bukatar gudu da sauri.
Maybe you’re ready, maybe not you.	Wataƙila kun shirya, watakila ba ku.
This, however, did not all happen overnight.	Wannan, duk da haka, ba duka ya faru dare ɗaya ba.
It works well.	Yana aiki yadda ya kamata.
Maybe now is the time.	Wataƙila yanzu ne lokacin.
Such a thing has never happened to me.	Irin wannan abu bai taba faruwa da ni ba.
I want to succeed	Ina son yin nasara
She can be with us.	Ta iya zama da mu.
We are sure now.	Mun tabbatar yanzu.
You should.	Ya kamata ku yi.
People are not interested in what she has to say.	Mutane ba sa sha’awar abin da za ta ce.
However, it is sleep.	Duk da haka, barci ne.
This is a great time for me.	Wannan babban lokaci ne a gare ni.
The reason can be explained as follows.	Za a iya bayyana dalilin kamar haka.
I have no problem with that.	Ba ni da wata matsala game da hakan.
It did not make it difficult to kill.	Bai sa ya yi wuya a kashe ba.
They will bring equipment.	Za su kawo kayan aiki.
He will too.	Shi ma zai yi.
However, they found a problem.	Duk da haka, sun sami matsala.
This will.	Wannan kuma zai.
One more and we know it will not work.	Guda ɗaya kuma mun san ba zai yi aiki ba.
Whatever it is, do not tell me.	Duk abin da yake, kada ku gaya mani.
She didn’t really surprise me with it.	Ba ta ba ni mamaki sosai da shi ba.
Look back.	Duba baya zuwa.
One failed to walk.	Daya kasa tafiya.
But that does not happen.	Amma abin ba ya faruwa.
But it will surely kill you.	Amma tabbas zai kashe ku.
Now this is absurd.	Yanzu wannan rashin hankali ne.
I felt a pain in the back of my head.	Na ji zafi a bayan kaina.
No one said he did.	Babu wanda ya ce ya yi.
I know you are working, so please give an answer when you can.	Na san kuna aiki, don haka don Allah a ba da amsa lokacin da za ku iya.
I do not know what she is thinking, what she knows and does not know.	Ban san abin da take tunani ba, abin da ta sani kuma ba ta sani ba.
So that seems to be the problem.	Don haka da alama wannan ita ce matsalar.
He is here, close by.	Yana nan, kusa da haka.
Make sure he hears.	Tabbatar kuma ya tabbata cewa ya ji.
It's so beautiful.	Yana da kyau sosai.
We were so tired that we agreed quickly.	Mun gaji har muka yarda da sauri.
I have a lot	Ina da yawa
So do the people.	Haka kuma mutane.
There is not much we can do.	Babu wani abu da yawa da za mu iya yi.
It rarely happens.	Yana da wuya ya faru.
We live in peace.	Muna zaune lafiya.
It's too cold.	Yayi sanyi sosai.
I'm worried about that.	Na damu da wannan.
That's why he bought this.	Shi ya sa ya sayi wannan.
We got it because we have each other.	Mun samu ta saboda muna da juna.
Just think you should know.	Kawai tunanin yakamata ku sani.
I can’t imagine why he would like this.	Ba zan iya tunanin dalilin da yasa zai so wannan ba.
It is true that we are weak.	Gaskiya ne cewa muna da rauni.
I had no idea what was going on.	Ban san abin da ke faruwa ba.
More of it.	Ƙarin shi.
She is wearing the right one.	An sa ta da wanda ya dace.
Use what you like.	Yi amfani da abin da kuke so.
Something like this should work.	Wani abu kamar wannan yakamata yayi aiki.
Where he was.	Inda ya kasance.
It's a little cold.	Ya dan yi sanyi.
But he did not give up.	Amma bai bar hakan ba.
She cries from where she is.	Kuka ta fito daga inda take.
But he would think of something.	Amma zai yi tunanin wani abu.
The room was like a movie theater.	Dakin ya kasance kamar shirin fim.
He told me a little.	Ya ce mini kadan.
No walking around it.	Babu tafiya a kusa da shi.
She will go inside.	Zata shiga ciki.
Be honest with me now.	Yi gaskiya da ni yanzu.
This is something you do for yourself.	Wannan wani abu ne da kuke yi muku.
They are not lost.	Ba su rasa ba.
I just know.	Na sani kawai.
But this shows a problem.	Amma wannan ya nuna matsala.
He can't do that.	Ba zai iya yin haka ba.
She looks at you.	Ta duba ku.
The sun is very hot	Rana ta yi zafi sosai
Of course the water will go back.	Tabbas ruwa zai koma baya.
Now she begins to wonder.	Yanzu ta fara mamaki.
I want to get in without any problems.	Ina so in shiga ba tare da wata matsala ba.
I have a job.	Ina da aikin yi.
I came close two years ago.	Na zo kusa shekaru biyu da suka wuce.
Anyone come with a car?	Kowa ya zo da mota?
Please try again.	Da fatan za a gwada.
It just happened.	Hakan ya faru ne kawai.
But he failed to say no to the suffering children.	Amma ya kasa cewa a'a ga yara masu wahala.
I started a cup of coffee.	Na fara wani kofi na kofi.
Very little happens as everything happens.	Kadan ne ke faruwa kamar yadda komai ke faruwa.
Right, he did.	Dama, ya yi.
I'm not sure he's dead but he looked.	Ban tabbata ya mutu ba amma ya duba.
At first, nothing.	Da farko, babu komai.
Many people travel to this place every year.	Mutane da yawa suna tafiya zuwa wannan wurin kowace shekara.
He hit the ground and left.	Ya buga kasa ya tafi.
There are many others.	Akwai da yawa wasu.
It's too early.	Da wuri ne.
I recommend reading it in its entirety.	Ina ba da shawarar karanta shi gaba ɗaya.
Maybe you read in it what you like.	Wataƙila kun karanta a ciki abin da kuke so.
And that's a good thing.	Kuma wannan abu ne mai kyau.
For everyone here.	Ga kowa da kowa a nan.
He enters.	Yana shiga.
Never go inside.	Kar a taɓa shiga ciki.
He will pass, given time, he told her.	Zai wuce, an ba da lokaci, ya gaya mata.
I don’t want to be you, either.	Ba na son zama ku, ko.
Maybe he died.	Wataƙila ya mutu.
Here I am.	Sai ga ni.
But he is not here.	Amma ba ya nan.
Just leave it covered, and just do it.	A bar ta kawai a rufe, kuma kawai a yi da ita.
Maybe more than that.	Wataƙila fiye da haka.
Boy did we cut our work.	Yaro mun yanke mana aikin mu.
It's not raining yet.	Ba a yi ruwan sama ba tukuna.
How could they not know.	Ta yaya ba za su sani ba.
He did not know what he was doing.	Bai san me yake yi ba.
With it.	Da shi.
I can join him.	Zan iya shiga gare shi.
This is true but it is not appropriate.	Wannan gaskiya ne amma bai dace ba.
We will pass.	Za mu wuce.
It's part of the program.	Yana daga cikin shirin.
It's better.	Ya fi.
He does not need anyone but himself.	Ba ya bukatar kowa sai kansa.
Stop from there.	Tsaya daga wurin.
It was great to be able to do that.	Yayi kyau sosai don samun damar yin hakan.
And very excited about it.	Kuma farin ciki sosai game da shi.
It's cold.	Yayi sanyi.
I can watch anything.	Zan iya kallon komai.
It was left as it was.	Sai aka bar shi kamar yadda yake.
He never really cared for me.	Bai taba kula da ni sosai ba.
He is not alone.	Ba shi kadai ba.
He would not leave her.	Ba zai bar ta ba.
I want to help people.	Ina son taimaka wa mutane.
And this sometimes.	Kuma wannan wani lokacin.
Bring it.	Kawo shi.
Either way.	Ta wata hanya ko wata.
I started you.	Na fara ku.
She couldn't say anything.	Ta kasa cewa komai.
No fear.	Babu tsoro.
But she knew it was early.	Amma ta san yana da wuri.
You must eat carefully!	Dole ne ku ci a hankali!
It is well cut.	An yanke ta da kyau.
It has not been released.	Ba a sake shi ba.
It has something to tell me.	Yana da abin da zai gaya mani.
I really like it.	Ina matukar son shi.
This does not fit, either.	Wannan bai yi daidai ba, ko ɗaya.
Their support is enormous too.	Taimakon su yana da girma kuma.
You did not turn it on.	Ba ku kunna shi ba.
It’s amazing to get involved in that.	Yana da ban mamaki don shiga cikin hakan.
I am very sick.	Ina rashin lafiya sosai.
Things are not taken on the road.	Ba a ɗaukar abubuwa a kan hanya.
It provided some comfort, but not much.	Ya ba da ɗan jin daɗi, amma ba da yawa ba.
Just a little bit.	Kawai dan kadan.
I have no money to buy anything.	Ba ni da kuɗi don siyan komai.
He was amazing.	Ya kasance mai ban mamaki.
Now go out and sit outside.	Yanzu ku fita ku zauna a waje.
In the end, they were alone.	A ƙarshe, sun kasance su kaɗai.
I can't believe it.	Ba zan iya yarda da shi ba.
That will come next week.	Hakan zai zo mako mai zuwa.
You do not fit me!	Ba ka dace da ni ba!
Most definitely.	Mafi tabbas.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Kamar komai yayi kyau.
It is our time.	Lokacin mu ne.
There is an easier way to do it.	Akwai hanya mafi sauƙi na yin ta.
So just me.	Don haka ni kawai.
She looks on.	Kallon ta yi.
And now they are dead.	Kuma yanzu sun mutu.
I will tell you what happened.	Zan gaya muku abin da ya faru.
They talk to the players.	Suna magana da 'yan wasan.
They have scary things.	Suna da abubuwan ban tsoro.
He is a good dog.	Shi kare ne mai kyau.
You really helped.	Lallai kun taimaka.
I said it was mine.	Na ce nawa ne.
You are beautiful	Kuna da kyau
So he just lost his debt.	Don haka bashi ne kawai ya rasa.
I love it, as she does.	Ina son shi, kamar yadda ta yi.
It's just here.	Yana nan kawai.
And they know that, too, it is only selfish.	Kuma sun san shi ma, son kai ne kawai.
She wants to get married, but she does not know how.	Tana son yin aure, amma ba ta san yaya ba.
However, do not worry.	Duk da haka, kada ku damu.
Joining with him has already worked well.	Shiga tare da shi ya riga ya yi aiki da kyau.
He sat next to me.	Ya zauna kusa da ni.
You are very useful.	Kun kasance masu amfani sosai.
Not 'us' or 'them'.	Ba 'mu' ko 'su' ba.
Do not believe everything you hear.	Kada ku yarda da duk abin da kuka ji.
You need to wait until the end.	Kuna buƙatar jira har zuwa ƙarshe.
Do not worry about it.	Kar ku damu da shi.
I don't know about that.	Ban sani ba game da wannan.
Can't remember what is right.	Ba za a iya tuna abin da yake daidai ba.
This is very good for you.	Wannan yayi muku kyau sosai.
It's hard, in fact.	Yana da wuya, a gaskiya.
He took a lot of time with us and was very helpful.	Ya dauki lokaci mai yawa tare da mu kuma ya taimaka sosai.
So, two things need to happen.	Don haka, abubuwa biyu suna buƙatar faruwa.
It's coming.	Yana zuwa.
He looks at how other people like him.	Yana kallon yadda sauran mutane suke so.
The meeting has been going on for a long time.	Taron ya kasance an dade.
And it was easy to do what was right.	Kuma ya kasance mai sauƙi don yin abin da kyau.
It is one o'clock, the place is full.	Karfe daya ne, wurin ya cika.
That all fits.	Wannan duk ya dace.
He has to come back.	Dole ya dawo.
There was no need for her too much.	Babu bukatar da ta yi masa yawa.
No one believed me.	Ba wanda ya yarda da ni.
They do not carry much heat.	Ba sa ɗaukar zafi sosai.
They did their homework.	Sun yi aikin gida.
He quit smoking.	Ya daina shan taba.
But in one way or another.	Amma ta hanya ɗaya ya yi.
Appropriate work is like speaking right.	Aikin da ya dace yana kama da magana daidai.
Now, something.	Yanzu, wani abu.
It could be your last game.	Zai iya zama wasan ku na ƙarshe.
Be a person who is always unable to do things.	Kasance mutumin da koyaushe yana kasa yin abubuwa.
She is now married.	Yanzu ta yi aure.
I want to talk to the person.	Ina son magana da mutumin.
I don’t know much about other girls.	Ban san da yawa game da sauran 'yan mata ba.
She told everyone what had happened.	Ta gaya wa kowa abin da ya faru.
It will work.	Zai yi aiki.
Let us act honestly.	Mu yi aiki da gaskiya.
Get up early tomorrow.	Tashi da wuri gobe.
I swim a lot.	Ina yin iyo da yawa.
I agree with you.	Na yarda da ku.
Together we can make them hear us.	Tare za mu iya sa su ji mu.
Not in a hurry.	Ba da sauri ba.
This has been true for some time.	Wannan gaskiya ne, har zuwa wani lokaci.
You may still be incompetent.	Har yanzu kuna iya rashin iya aiki.
This guy is good.	Wannan mutumin yana da kyau.
So fix it.	Don haka ku gyara.
Now she uses it more.	Yanzu ta fi amfani da ita.
Never touch.	Kada a taba.
All are dead but the last.	Duk sun mutu amma na baya.
She didn't stop.	Ba ta tsaya ba.
I knew he would be there, sitting outside.	Na san cewa zai kasance a wurin, yana zaune a waje.
Nothing here for me now.	Babu wani abu a nan gare ni yanzu.
They do not have to lose anyone.	Ba lallai ne su rasa kowa ba.
Still, people love it.	Duk da haka, mutane suna son hakan.
Long working hours must be carefully monitored	Dole ne a kula da tsawon lokacin aiki sosai
You know, like mine.	Ka sani, kamar nawa.
He called me.	Ya kira ni.
There has to be a way.	Dole ne a sami wata hanya.
This need hardly surprise us.	Wannan bukatar da wuya mu ba mu mamaki.
What he knows.	Abin da ya sani.
I know because it happened to me.	Na sani saboda abin ya faru da ni.
His head is there, though.	Kansa yana can, ko da yake.
Maybe the fear of the unknown.	Watakila tsoron abin da ba a sani ba ne.
What do you want to eat?	Me kuke so ku ci?
We will be back to exactly where we started the day.	Za mu dawo daidai inda muka fara ranar.
It feels a little out there.	Yana jin kadan a can.
That's why he is in the lead.	Shi ya sa yake kan gaba.
However, do not worry.	Duk da haka, kada ku damu.
You do not have to prove everything to anyone.	Ba lallai ne ku ƙara tabbatar wa kowa komai ba.
Don't even think about it.	Kada ka ma yi tunani game da shi.
I have done you good.	Na yi muku kyau.
I think the time has come for us to really do it.	Ina tsammanin lokaci ya yi da muka yi da gaske.
He did not hear criticism.	Bai ji suka ba.
Where correct and error appear.	Inda daidai da kuskure suka bayyana.
But here in the backyard, the world is still at home.	Amma a nan bayan gida, duniya har yanzu tana cikin gida.
I have already put you well.	Na riga na saka ku sosai.
There are so many now.	Akwai da yawa yanzu.
No one can change it.	Babu wanda zai iya canza shi.
Police did not arrest anyone.	'Yan sanda ba su kama kowa ba.
He doesn’t want anything to give him anything.	Ba ya son wani abu da zai ba shi wani abu.
Go home.	Tafi gida.
A walker is a walking person.	Mai tafiya mutum ne mai tafiya.
Let's talk money.	Mu yi magana kudi.
The ship is moving slowly through the water.	Jirgin yana tafiya a hankali ta cikin ruwa.
This cannot be done by running at the same time.	Ba za a iya yin haka da gudu a lokaci guda ba.
It may be true.	Yana iya zama gaskiya.
Not for me.	Ba gare ni ba.
We must look for what all the children need.	Dole ne mu nemi abin da duk yara ke bukata.
She doesn't like that idea.	Ba ta son wannan tunanin.
There will never be other people like them.	Ba za a taɓa samun wasu mutane kamar su ba.
The runner started to come.	Mai gudu ya fara zuwa.
None did.	Babu ko daya da yayi.
I think that's good.	Ina ganin hakan yana da kyau.
The sun has risen.	Rana ta fito.
She also does not agree.	Ita ma bata yarda ba.
No one will stop here.	Babu wanda zai tsaya a nan.
I can't sleep.	Ba zan iya barci ba.
It must be made to happen.	Dole ne a sanya shi ya faru.
Of course I will get that.	Tabbas zan samu hakan.
All of these things have never been done.	Duk waɗannan abubuwan ba a taɓa yin su ba.
I got more than I have today.	Na samu fiye da abin da yau.
I will prove it.	Zan tabbatar da shi.
I think this is interesting too.	Ina tsammanin wannan yana da ban sha'awa kuma.
She was cold, she didn’t.	Ta yi sanyi, ba ta yi ba.
Gradually too much.	A hankali yayi yawa.
She slept soundly at night.	Ta yi barci sosai a daren.
Slightly above.	Dan sama kadan.
Maybe he could have said he was ill that day.	Wataƙila zai iya cewa ya yi rashin lafiya a ranar.
I don't want anything to change.	Ba na son wani abu ya canza.
A speaker asked something for the meeting.	Wani mai magana ya tambayi wani abu ga taron.
As it should and hardly be.	Kamar yadda ya kamata kuma da wuya ya kasance.
Let me help you.	Bari in taimake ku.
You still will never say that.	Har yanzu ba za ku taɓa cewa ba.
She will be there.	Za ta kasance a can.
What else is a person?	Menene kuma mutum?
Don't do it.	Kada ku yi shi.
Or, he was.	Ko kuma, ya kasance.
He learns from her.	Yana koyi da ita.
Sometimes these things happen, there is nothing you can do about it.	Wani lokaci waɗannan abubuwan suna faruwa, babu abin da za ku iya yi game da shi.
I must say.	Dole ne in ji.
Another time, somewhere he thought.	Wani lokaci kuma, wani wurin ya yi tunani.
Why didn't you come yesterday?	Me yasa jiya baka zo ba?
We see that happening here.	Muna ganin hakan yana faruwa a nan.
You know, it's true.	Ka sani, yayi gaskiya.
Great place, but also scary.	Babban wuri, amma kuma mai ban tsoro.
I have seen something like this before.	Na ga irin wannan a baya.
No one can do it for us.	Babu wanda zai iya yi mana.
It is the best way.	Ita ce hanya mafi kyau.
It is not too late.	Ba a makara ba.
I fixed it that way.	Na gyara shi haka.
We can't do anything.	Ba za mu iya yin wani abu ba.
John has been ill for many years.	John ya yi rashin lafiya shekaru da yawa.
Don't stop there.	Kar a tsaya nan.
Dan saba.	Dan saba.
I would prefer coffee.	Da na fi son kofi.
I don't want you to catch me.	Ba zan so ku kama ni ba.
They can only supply materials.	Za su iya ba da kayan kawai.
I want to see that.	Ina so in ga haka.
I have to live somehow.	Dole ne in yi rayuwa ko ta yaya.
Hope you enjoyed the ride !.	Da fatan kun ji daɗin tafiya!.
It is time to move on.	Lokaci ya yi da za a ci gaba.
I can drive later.	Zan iya tuƙi daga baya.
It is a way to make delicious food but sufficient.	Yana da hanyar yin abinci mai daɗi amma mai isa.
I don't want to live in this house.	Bana son zama a gidan nan.
So that's what we're playing with.	Don haka abin da muka yi ta wasa da shi ke nan.
Of course she missed that.	Tabbas ta rasa hakan.
She didn't feel well.	Ba ta ji dadi ba.
And he was.	Sai ya kasance.
In fact, this is incorrect.	A gaskiya, wannan ba daidai ba ne.
I do not know what happened to him now.	Ban san me ya faru da shi yanzu ba.
We have not been able to do that yet.	Ba mu sami damar yin hakan ba tukuna.
And you can get them.	Kuma kuna iya samun su.
Now, it seems we are on the road.	Yanzu, da alama muna kan hanya.
I know how hot it is.	Na san yadda yake zafi.
I really enjoy reading it.	Ina matukar sha'awar karanta shi.
Everything that happened after, happened.	Duk abin da ya faru bayan, ya faru.
This can be fun.	Wannan yana iya zama mai daɗi.
I feel he cares about her.	Ina jin ya damu da ita.
I have to get home early.	Dole na dawo gida da wuri.
So, of course, she did it immediately.	Don haka, ba shakka, nan da nan ta yi.
Somehow, some say.	Ko ta yaya, wasu suka ce.
There is something you should know.	Akwai wani abu da ya kamata ku sani.
To the one who takes care of it.	Zuwa ga wanda ya kula da shi.
But it still won't work.	Amma har yanzu ba zai yi aiki ba.
I will work.	Zan yi aiki.
It was a difficult year.	Shekaru ne mai wahala.
Very comfortable.	Jin dadi sosai.
Stay there.	Ku zauna a can.
Cold water did not help.	Ruwan sanyi bai taimaka ba.
We know that.	Mun san haka.
Children grow up fast.	Yara suna girma da sauri.
He was a handful.	Ya kasance dan hannu.
It's so delicious.	Yana da daɗi sosai.
But it doesn't work tonight.	Amma ba ya aiki a daren yau.
They are already here.	Sun riga sun kasance a nan.
Truth be told.	Gaskiya ta fada.
But there is only so much to say.	Amma akwai wannan kawai da za a ce.
The person nearby can do that.	Mutumin da ke kusa zai iya yin hakan.
No more talking.	Babu sauran magana.
She does not know how long she has been here.	Ba ta san tsawon lokacin da ta yi a nan ba.
They are water repellent.	Su ne mai da ruwa.
I heard it.	Na ji shi.
It is better to prepare lunch.	Gara shirya abincin rana.
You know, if you want to join me, cool.	Ka sani, idan kana son shiga da ni, sanyi.
They will not laugh with you at dinner.	Ba za su yi dariya tare da ku a wurin abincin dare ba.
Many people have known them for two years.	Mutane da yawa sun san su da shekaru biyu.
They are with me.	Suna tare da ni.
It's been almost a year.	Kusan shekara guda kenan da yin magana.
They only understood the truth.	Sun fahimci gaskiya ne kawai.
We can't stay here.	Ba za mu iya zama a nan ba.
It's just right.	Daidai ne kawai.
It's too much to do.	Ya yi yawa ya yi.
However, he has work to do, and he does.	Duk da haka, yana da aikin da zai yi, kuma ya yi.
You have to stay with me.	Dole ne ku zauna tare da ni.
She could not run.	Ba ta iya gudu ba.
You want to stay there.	Kuna so ku zauna a can.
I just did it.	Na yi shi kawai.
And you can't change anything.	Kuma ba za ku iya canza komai ba.
I'm just not sure.	Kawai ban tabbata ba.
I often do.	Ina yawan yi.
They closed.	Suka rufe.
I am the best.	Ni ne mafi kyau.
She could not get out.	Ta kasa fita.
I would have explained that.	Da na bayyana hakan.
But now we are finally in a good place.	Amma yanzu muna a ƙarshe a wuri mai kyau.
But perhaps many are unsure.	Amma watakila da yawa ba su da tabbas.
To each other.	Da juna.
Do this whole procedure twice a week.	Yi wannan gaba ɗaya hanya sau biyu a mako.
Now go and get it back.	Yanzu ku je ku dawo da ita.
Much this.	Da yawa wannan.
I need to prepare.	Ina bukata in shirya.
I will never be happy again like this.	Ba zan sake yin farin ciki kamar wannan ba.
No one can enter the toilet.	Babu wanda zai iya shiga bayan gida.
He said he was looking for a job.	Yace yana neman aiki.
I used it a lot.	Na yi amfani da shi sosai.
Not for pregnancy.	Babu don ciki.
You need to keep it inside.	Kuna buƙatar ajiye shi a ciki.
No one can do it for you.	Babu wanda zai iya yi maka.
Don't worry about crying, worry if you can't hear anything.	Kada ku damu da kuka, ku damu idan ba za ku iya jin komai ba.
And he further saw something.	Kuma ya kara ganin wani abu.
And so it was.	Kuma hakan ya kasance.
I'll show myself.	Zan nuna kaina.
It will rain.	Za yi ruwa.
You will cut yourself.	Za ku yanke kanku.
She ran with him though.	Ta gudu da shi duk da haka.
I have never been involved in that.	Ban taba shiga cikin hakan ba.
She is very thoughtful.	Tunani take sosai.
He is with her.	Yana tare da ita.
Which is why you keep going.	Abin da ya sa ku ci gaba.
I can do anything.	Zan iya yin komai.
It’s hard, it’s not a good time.	Yana da wuya, ba lokaci mai kyau ba ne.
I can say that these things are true for you.	Zan iya cewa waɗannan abubuwan gaskiya ne a gare ku.
But it goes beyond that.	Amma ya wuce haka.
We were waiting.	Mun kasance muna jira.
They are finally ready!	A ƙarshe sun shirya!
That says something.	Wannan ya ce wani abu.
We'd love to hear from you !.	Za mu so mu ji daga gare ku!.
You can tell me later.	Kuna iya gaya mani daga baya.
I was told no.	Aka ce min a'a.
When you speak, people will hear.	Lokacin da kuke magana, mutane za su ji.
It is not enough.	Bai isa ba.
I'll see if you can do that.	Zan gani ko za ku iya yin hakan.
But well, maybe that's not the problem.	Amma da kyau, watakila wannan ba matsala ba ne.
With them, it was a success.	Tare da su, an yi nasara.
They are still there.	Har yanzu suna can.
That makes you suffer.	Hakan yana sa ku wahala.
I'm not studying.	Ba karatu nake ba.
I thought a lot about this.	Na yi tunani da yawa game da wannan.
You can imagine what this trip was like.	Kuna iya tunanin yadda wannan tafiya ta kasance.
Of course he never paid for it.	Tabbas bai taba biya shi ba.
But it is not true.	Amma ba gaskiya bane.
Think of what he can do with three things.	Ka yi tunanin abin da zai iya yi da abubuwa uku.
I will	zan
But it shows.	Amma ya nuna.
This has happened once before.	Hakan ya faru sau ɗaya a baya.
Please wait for it !.	Da fatan za a jira shi!.
And they are very interesting.	Kuma suna da ban sha'awa sosai.
Things are not as they used to be.	Abubuwa ba kamar yadda suke a da ba.
The bad day has come and gone.	Mummunan ranar ta zo ta tafi.
Getting a look.	Samun gani .
To us.	Zuwa gare mu.
It is such a beautiful place.	Wani irin kyakkyawan wuri ne.
We thought it was the only way.	Mun dauka ita ce kawai hanya.
You have it in you all.	Kuna da shi a cikin ku gaba ɗaya.
For some, it just happens.	Ga wasu, yana faruwa ne kawai.
I was drinking my coffee and planning the day.	Ina shan kofi na kuma na yi shirin ranar.
It has to be the real reason.	Dole ne ya zama ainihin dalilin.
He is not gone now.	Ba yanzu ya tafi ba.
I beg your pardon.	Ina fatan ka yi hakuri da ni.
But we knew we would.	Amma mun san za mu yi.
I will remember.	Zan tuna.
This is not surprising.	Wannan ba mamaki ba ne.
He wanted so much, so much.	Ya so da yawa, da yawa.
They feel like they are made of metal.	Sai suka ji kamar karfe ne aka yi su.
There is nothing wrong here.	Babu kuskure a nan.
The sky is also not visible.	Ba a kuma ganin sama ko sama ba.
He will be accustomed to things.	Zai saba da abubuwa.
Do not pay anything.	Kar ku biya komai.
I just had the first thing.	Ina da abu na farko kawai.
That's why he is there.	Shi ya sa yake can.
It's hard.	Yana da wuya.
And she tells you.	Kuma ta gaya muku.
I only took one.	Na dauki daya kawai.
She felt something was wrong.	Ta ji wani abu ba daidai ba ne.
I want to see you there.	Ina son ganin ku a wurin.
We will miss you for a while.	Za mu rasa ku na ɗan lokaci.
Maybe a little louder.	Wataƙila ɗan ƙara.
Stop here for a moment.	Tsaya nan don ɗan lokaci.
If we want to fix it, it's one thing.	Idan muna son gyara shi, abu daya ne.
She later married.	Daga baya aka yi aure.
Or others like them.	Ko wasu irin su.
This is as simple as it gets.	Wannan yana da sauƙi kamar yadda yake samu.
People are talking about it.	Mutane suna magana game da shi.
Somehow she could not succeed.	Ko ta yaya ba za ta iya yin nasara ba.
No food to buy.	Babu abincin da za a saya.
I came back.	Na dawo da baya.
You see how it failed.	Ka ga yadda ya kasa.
One can not say more than that.	Mutum ba zai iya cewa fiye da haka ba.
You can find it all.	Kuna iya gano shi duka.
She saw people.	Ta ga mutane.
I would not leave home without him.	Ba zan bar gida ba tare da shi ba.
She loves to read.	Tana son karatu.
I’m with you on the car though.	Ina tare da ku akan abin mota ko da yake.
And they were arrested.	Kuma an kama su.
John lit a cigarette.	John ya kunna taba.
I am with them all.	Ina tare da su duka.
In this game.	A cikin wannan wasan.
She can do nothing for us.	Ba za ta iya yi mana komai ba.
And it's not as big as you think.	Kuma ba abu ne mai girma kamar yadda kuke tunani ba.
This is not something she thinks she has ever wanted.	Wannan ba abu ne da take tunanin ta taba so ba.
It was the man who helped me.	Mutumin ne ya taimake ni.
It will be released next week.	Za a sake shi mako mai zuwa.
I would say get started easily and do your job.	Zan ce a fara sauƙi kuma ku yi aikin ku.
It suits me very well.	Ya dace da ni sosai.
He is not very well, he is not well.	Ba shi da lafiya sosai, ba shi da lafiya.
Of course I'll be back.	Tabbas zan dawo.
We can’t and shouldn’t.	Ba za mu iya ba kuma bai kamata ba.
Use others.	Yi amfani da wasu.
I'm really sorry.	Na yi hakuri da gaske.
It's out.	An fita waje ne.
This is one way to do it.	Wannan hanya ɗaya ce ta yin ta.
So it really comes down to this.	Don haka da gaske ya zo ga wannan.
Shall we eat?	Za mu ci?
Please sit down.	Don Allah a zauna.
So far.	Don haka har yanzu.
Many women are involved.	Mata da yawa sun shiga ciki.
What you said is very interesting.	Abin da kuka faɗa yana da ban sha'awa sosai.
You are really alone.	Lallai kun kasance kawai kaɗai.
That all brought me to this project.	Wannan duk ya kawo ni wannan aikin.
If she returns.	Idan ta koma.
He could not hear.	Ya kasa ji.
No one will stop.	Ba wanda zai tsaya.
We all hope that will be the case.	Mu duka muna fatan hakan ya kasance.
He was close to me somehow.	Ya kasance kusa da ni ko ta yaya.
All the while he kept going and about to get married.	Duk tsawon lokacin ya ci gaba da tafiya kuma game da bikin aure.
We used to do it right.	Mun kasance muna yin shi daidai.
At some point it started to rain.	A wani lokaci aka fara yin ruwan sama.
It really does come.	Da gaske ya zo.
We like it.	Mun so shi.
We are together.	Muna tare.
Here’s what’s interesting.	Ga abin da ke da ban sha'awa.
I do not want to lose things.	Ba na son rasa abubuwa.
No one took me at night.	Ba wanda ya kai ni dare.
I have to stop here.	Dole ne in tsaya a nan.
Think about it for a moment.	Ka yi tunanin hakan na ɗan lokaci.
But this is not the case.	Amma wannan ba shine wannan ba.
Of course I did not know there was a name.	Tabbas ban san akwai suna ba.
It feels a lot bigger.	Yana jin girma da yawa.
Don't worry.	Kada ya damu.
Hope you like.	Da fatan za ku so.
I couldn’t be closer to people like me.	Ba zan iya zama kusa da mutane kamar ni ba.
Someone had come to her in a boat.	Da wani ya zo mata da jirgin ruwa.
I will talk to him.	Zan yi magana da shi.
But now he knows that is not true.	Amma yanzu ya san hakan ba gaskiya ba ne.
That's the way it is.	Haka abin yake.
But now everyone appears to know him.	Amma yanzu kowa ya bayyana ya san shi.
But only through money.	Amma kawai ta hanyar kuɗi.
It must have been shown that.	Lallai an nuna haka.
If it is any.	Idan yana da wani.
Off after use.	Kashe bayan amfani.
I never agreed with him on that.	Ban taba yarda da shi akan hakan ba.
We have reached this point.	Mun kai wannan lokacin.
A person who is unemployed and has no future.	Mutumin da ba shi da aiki kuma ba shi da gaba.
He wrote back.	Ya rubuta baya.
I'll get more later.	Zan sami ƙarin daga baya.
Only one thing is necessary.	Abu ɗaya ne kawai dole.
This time in a hurry.	Wannan lokacin a cikin sauri sauri.
We are still married.	Har yanzu muna da aure.
See for yourself.	Duba don kanku.
There is something very serious about that.	Akwai wani abu mai girma sosai game da hakan.
It's something new.	Wani sabon abu ne.
It was a few years ago.	Shekaru kadan da suka gabata ne.
She loves hot drinks.	Tana son abubuwan sha masu zafi.
Maybe she did but it was something unusual.	Watakila ta yi amma abu ne da ba a saba gani ba.
Nothing like that anymore, with another person.	Ba wani abu kamar wannan kuma, tare da wani mutum.
It is not acceptable.	Ba abin yarda ba ne.
Now, it seems like the right thing to do.	Yanzu, ya zama kamar daidai abin da za a yi.
Whenever they want, they use me.	Duk lokacin da suka ga dama, sai su yi amfani da ni.
Save items in place.	Ajiye abubuwa a wuri.
It's easy to make a mistake, too.	Yana da sauƙi a yi kuskure, ma.
Do not take either name.	Kar a ɗauka suna da ko ɗaya.
But she felt comfortable.	Amma ta ji dadi.
Keep up the amazing work.	Ci gaba da aikin ban mamaki.
What will he do next?	Me zai yi a gaba?.
Generally know that.	Gaba ɗaya san cewa.
It's a long trip.	Tsawon tafiya ne.
In fact, make it two.	A gaskiya, sanya shi biyu.
Toward.	Zuwa ga.
That's why they are there to do it.	Shi ya sa suke can don yin hakan.
Only one day.	Kwana daya ne kawai.
He is OK now.	Yana da lafiya yanzu.
I went to stay.	Na tafi in zauna.
Replenishment is often obtained.	Ana samun sake cika sau da yawa.
She ran.	Ta gudu.
And they succeeded.	Kuma sun yi nasara.
This is another sign.	Wannan wata alama ce.
This is not something that everyone should like.	Wannan ba wani abu bane da ya kamata kowa ya so.
This is not the case.	Wannan ba haka bane.
He worked without a hitch twice.	Ya yi aiki ba tare da matsala ba sau biyu.
To feel himself in her.	Don jin kansa a cikin ta.
But we have the best.	Amma muna da mafi kyau.
I will be completely covered for a long time.	Za a rufe ni gaba daya na tsawon lokaci.
That has not changed.	Wannan bai canza ba.
The man drove slowly down the wrong path.	Mutumin ya tuƙi a hankali a kan hanyar da ba ta dace ba.
He didn't care.	Bai kula da hakan ba.
Only a few will be able to access it.	'Yan kaɗan ne kawai za su iya samun damar yin amfani da shi.
No wonder you are tired.	Ba mamaki ka gaji.
I recommend it.	Ina ba da shawarar shi.
What is it.	Menene shi.
It is a busy night.	Dare ne mai yawan aiki.
even me.	har ma da ni.
The thought seemed like nonsense.	Tunanin ya zama kamar rashin hankali.
When we come.	Idan muka zo.
And the name is good.	Kuma sunan yana da kyau.
I do not know what happened.	Ban san abin da ya faru ba.
If we were right, they would never do that.	Idan muka yi daidai, ba za su taɓa yin hakan ba.
I just want to get in the car and drive.	Ina so in shiga mota kawai in tuƙi.
Then I prepared myself.	Sai na shirya kaina.
Give him the book, please.	Ka ba shi littafin, don Allah.
They would expect that.	Za su yi tsammanin hakan.
You can make it as comfortable as you want.	Kuna iya sanya shi jin daɗi kamar yadda kuke so.
You can see everything really.	Kuna iya ganin komai da gaske.
But they refused to accept him.	Amma sun ƙi yarda da shi.
But by then, you already knew that.	Amma a lokacin, kun riga kun san hakan.
I can hear things.	Zan iya jin abubuwa.
But it was not easy.	Amma bai kasance mai sauƙi ba.
And this is the most amazing thing.	Kuma wannan shine mafi ban mamaki.
We know what we want to do in the game.	Mun san abin da muke so mu yi a wasan.
She will know.	Za ta sani.
Me too.	Ni kuma.
Two truths one lies.	Biyu gaskiya daya karya.
When you reach the age of three it is more difficult.	Idan kun kai shekara uku ya fi wahala.
I have never been ill.	Ban taba yin rashin lafiya ba.
I was happy.	Na yi farin ciki.
It is good to be here with her.	Yana da kyau zama a nan tare da ita.
So if anyone can help me that would be great.	Don haka idan wani zai iya taimaka min hakan zai yi kyau.
It's not very good.	Ba ya da kyau sosai.
Before we leave.	Kafin mu tafi.
I feel it.	Ina jin shi.
Come here now!	Ku zo nan a yanzu!
I doubt we will get more tonight.	Ina shakka za mu sami ƙarin a daren yau.
You are in this.	Kuna cikin wannan.
He knew he was there.	Ya san yana can.
I could be killed.	Ana iya kashe ni.
They are not good things.	Ba su kasance abubuwa masu kyau ba.
Just think and stay safe.	Yi tunani kawai kuma a zauna lafiya.
It cannot come to you.	Ba zai iya zuwa gare ku ba.
Forget that they are accustomed.	Manta cewa sun saba.
On you all.	Akan ku duka.
I wondered how they would let me do that.	Na yi mamakin yadda za su bar ni haka.
Not me, anyway.	Ba ni ba, ko ta yaya.
I don’t know things anyway.	Ban san abubuwa ta wata hanya ba.
If he dies tonight, she too.	Idan ya mutu a daren nan, ita ma.
So you have to fix it.	Don haka dole ne ku gyara.
We can hear it too.	Mu ma muna iya jin shi.
It's good, he said.	Ya yi kyau, in ji shi.
She didn't seem to care or anything.	Ba kamar ta damu ba ko wani abu.
We know nothing about where he went.	Ba mu san komai ba game da inda ya tafi.
I told him to get out.	Na ce masa ya fita.
We will think of something.	Za mu yi tunanin wani abu.
Maybe I still have one.	Wataƙila har yanzu ina da ɗaya.
Start from the beginning.	Fara daga farko.
He did it for her.	Ya yi mata.
He hasn't done it since me.	Ba ya yi tun da ni.
I do not know.	Ban sani ba.
We are definitely needed.	Babu shakka ana bukatar mu.
Then we met in the thirties.	Sai mun hadu a cikin talatin.
They are taken care of.	An kula da su.
It comes from almost everything.	Ya fito daga kusan komai.
Try it for yourself.	Gwada shi da kanku.
You take one thing and get another.	Kuna ɗauka abu ɗaya kuma ku sami wani.
I'm sorry, she said, but.	Yi hakuri, ta ce, amma.
People love it.	Mutane suna son shi.
He prefers to go out alone.	Ya fi son fita shi kadai.
No, not now.	A'a, ba yanzu ba.
He sued.	Ya kai kara.
Now that she can do it without seeing.	Yanzu da ta iya yi ba tare da gani ba.
Open it.	Ka bude shi.
We already have more than one.	Mun riga muna da fiye da ɗaya.
It was a difficult year.	Shekara ce mai wahala.
As shown earlier, this did not happen.	Kamar yadda aka nuna a baya, wannan bai faru ba.
I will bring them tomorrow.	Zan zo da su gobe in tafi.
Many people think driving is fun.	Mutane da yawa suna tunanin cewa tuƙi yana da ban sha'awa.
It makes me sick.	Yana sa ni rashin lafiya.
You have to act fast.	Dole ne ku yi aiki da sauri.
I am in pain	Ina jin zafi
I think they will do well.	Ina tsammanin za su yi kyau.
The new moon is being seen tonight.	Ana ganin sabon wata a daren yau.
And he waited again.	Kuma ya ƙara jira.
To me this is a real surprise.	A gare ni wannan abin mamaki ne na gaske.
Just stay at the house.	Ku tsaya a gidan kawai.
He did too.	Shi ma ya yi.
All in one.	Duk a daya.
The back door is not here.	Kofar baya nan.
They were all amazed.	Duk suka yi mamaki.
Maybe there is such a thing.	Wataƙila akwai irin wannan abu.
Get up from there.	Tashi daga can.
We have a lot of time.	Muna da lokaci mai yawa.
Lastly, don’t be afraid to get involved.	A ƙarshe, kada ku ji tsoron shiga ciki.
We agree that it should.	Mun yarda cewa ya kamata.
It is difficult to accept the truth.	Yana da wuya a yarda da gaskiya.
What do you think killed her?	Me kuke tunanin ya kashe ta?
Our thoughts are with him.	Tunanin mu yana tare da shi.
The bigger the better.	Mafi girma shine mafi kyau.
For me, eating out is a big deal.	A gare ni, cin abinci a waje babban abu ne.
I like one, though.	Ina son daya, ko da yake.
Many do not grow up.	Mutane da yawa ba sa girma.
And they get it.	Kuma suna samun shi.
You must let it go.	Dole ne ku bar shi ya tafi.
She wrote something.	Ta rubuta wani abu.
If in the past he did not feel sick, he will probably do it now.	Idan a da bai ji rashin lafiya ba, tabbas zai yi yanzu.
There is only one answer and this is simple.	Amsa ɗaya ce kawai kuma wannan mai sauƙi ce.
It's amazing with her.	Yana da ban mamaki da ita.
They grow very fast.	Sun yi girma da sauri da sauri.
And it did not appear.	Kuma bai bayyana ba.
That was a big job.	Wannan ya kasance babban aiki.
It scares you.	Yana ba ku tsoro.
This is very difficult for us.	Wannan yana da wahala a gare mu da gaske.

When you are injured, this is a big job.	Lokacin da kuka ji rauni, wannan shine babban aiki.
I recognized him.	Na gane shi.
We don't like it.	Ba ma son shi.
The room is entered.	Dakin ya shiga.
I don't think he came out.	Bana jin ya fito.
They are about to get into the water.	Suna shirin shiga cikin ruwan.
But let's get started.	Amma bari mu fara.
So many people today have this feeling.	Don haka mutane da yawa a yau suna da wannan tunanin.
And this is nothing new.	Kuma wannan ba sabon abu ba ne.
Nothing to say or do, of course.	Babu abin da zai iya cewa ko yi, ba shakka.
We met on the way.	Mun hadu a hanya.
And you should be comfortable at all times.	Kuma ya kamata ku kasance masu jin dadi a kowane lokaci.
No one was ever a womanizer.	Babu wanda ya kasance mai son mata.
I remember the man.	Na tuna mutumin.
Game.	Wasa.
He is tired.	Ya gaji.
Maybe it's too much, or maybe not so much.	Wataƙila yana da yawa, ko watakila ba haka ba ne.
When no one is around.	Lokacin da babu kowa a kusa.
This man has suffered terribly.	Wannan mutumin ya sha wahala sosai.
He kept looking at us.	Ya ci gaba da kallon mu.
But I still need help.	Amma har yanzu ina bukatar taimako.
Speaking of which to be true.	Da yake magana ya zama gaskiya.
I live on one now.	Ina zaune akan daya yanzu.
You do not have to do this right now.	Ba lallai ne ku yi wannan ba a yanzu.
It is truly amazing.	Lallai abin mamaki ne.
Come with me now.	Ku zo tare da ni yanzu.
And you take it as you wish.	Kuma kuna ɗaukar hakan yadda kuke so.
That way you will know that they really are.	Ta haka za ku san cewa da gaske suke.
Tell him to do things.	Fada masa yayi abubuwa.
It hurts me to do that.	Ya yi mini zafi don yin hakan.
It is better to work alone today.	Yana da kyau a yi aiki kadai a yau.
More may be found in the future.	Ana iya gano wasu a nan gaba.
We just are not.	Mu ne kawai ba .
I want her to hate it.	Ina so ta ƙi shi.
Something is wrong here.	Wani abu ba daidai ba a nan.
It is a victory for everyone.	Nasara ce ga kowa.
More often than not.	Sau da yawa fiye da a'a.
One is not very good.	Daya ba shi da kyau sosai.
It's over, she thought.	An gama an gama da ita, ta yi tunani.
Do not want to remove it.	Kada a so a cire shi.
I think it's good.	Ina ganin yana da kyau.
It makes me interested in what they have.	Yana sa ni sha'awar abin da suke da shi.
That would be nice.	Hakan zai yi kyau.
It is still not far from where the night is.	Har yanzu bai wuce inda daren ya ke ba.
You should see.	Ya kamata ku gani.
I think it's good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau.
What is happening is on a whim.	Abin da ke faruwa yana kan jin dadi.
Explain it to him.	Ka bayyana masa hakan.
This is not uncommon.	Hakan bai saba faruwa ba.
Just a little while longer.	Kawai dan lokaci kadan.
If you have a child there you want the best.	Idan kuna da yaro a can kuna son mafi kyau.
But, that's it.	Amma, shi ke nan.
You are like an intelligent person.	Kai kamar mutum ne mai hankali.
I'm not feeling well, you know.	Ban ji dadi ba, ka sani.
They were happy together.	Sun yi farin ciki tare.
He said you are a weak person.	Yace kai mutum ne mai rauni.
Let's not buy anything yet!	Kada mu sayi komai tukuna!
Each, one, day.	Kowace, guda, rana.
I will prepare a place for you.	Zan shirya muku wuri.
It's good.	Ya yi kyau.
Only people.	Mutane ne kawai.
Most often, this is not true.	Mafi sau da yawa, wannan ba gaskiya ba ne.
Everything is true.	Duk abin da yake gaskiya ne.
This is not easy to do.	Wannan ba shi da sauƙi a yi.
Prepare lunch and water.	Shirya abincin rana da ruwa.
Never doubt.	Kada ku taba shakka.
Of course, you say.	Tabbas, kuna cewa.
I will read.	Zan karanta.
A boat is a boat.	Jirgin ruwa jirgin ruwa ne.
She has to succeed.	Dole ta yi nasara.
You can't see about that.	Ba za ku iya gani a kan hakan ba.
He apologized and left.	Ya bashi hakuri ya tafi.
I think	ina ji
Come with me, and you will live in peace.	Ku zo tare da ni, za ku zauna lafiya.
He himself did not work.	Shi kansa bai yi aiki ba.
When I go.	Lokacin da zan tafi.
We say.	Mu ce.
Something similar happened.	Wani irin abu ya faru.
He was alone there.	Shi kadai a wurin.
Cold hands heard it.	Hannu masu sanyi suka ji shi.
Sometimes, when she is not around, they talk about it.	A wani lokaci, idan ba ta kusa, suna magana game da shi.
I was excited about the flight.	Na yi farin ciki game da jirgin.
There, this is even better.	A can, wannan ya fi kyau.
And he knows it too.	Kuma ya san shi ma.
People just assume without water around it is useless.	Mutane kawai suna ɗauka ba tare da ruwa a kusa da shi ba shi da amfani.
We must learn from the past.	Dole ne mu yi koyi da abubuwan da suka gabata.
Maybe she did that in the first place.	Wataƙila ta yi haka tun da farko.
That's just it.	Haka ne kawai.
I wrote a second.	Na rubuta na biyu.
I love you	Ina son ku
I am looking for a job	ina neman aiki
He used to walk on his own to get it.	Ya kasance yana tafiya da kansa don samun shi.
And maybe not necessarily.	Kuma watakila ba lallai ba ne.
Will you stay with us ?.	Za ku tsaya tare da mu?.
I started crying.	Na fara kuka.
Second edition.	Buga na biyu.
But I was just.	Amma ni ne kawai.
However, this is her right.	Duk da haka, wannan ita ce dama ta.
We were right at the time.	Mun yi daidai a lokacin.
This is 'where'.	Wannan shine 'inda'.
I never found out what it was.	Ban taba gano menene ba.
You know what’s going on.	Kun san abin da ke faruwa.
It feels great.	Ji yayi girma.
She doesn't even know where to start.	Ba ta ma san ta inda za ta fara ba.
Let's see what they can do.	Bari mu ga abin da za su iya yi.
If you need anything, just call me.	Idan kuna buƙatar wani abu, kawai ku kira ni.
Water and food are scarce.	Ruwa da abinci sun kare.
But some things take time.	Amma wasu abubuwa suna ɗaukar lokaci.
You will be what you are.	Za ku zama abin da kuke.
Sorry it must come to this.	Yi hakuri dole ne ya zo ga wannan.
Of course you are not very good at it.	Tabbas ba ku da kyau sosai.
Probably the hardest part.	Wataƙila wannan shine mafi wuya.
It was eventually fixed.	A ƙarshe an gyara shi.
But he quickly realized it could not be so.	Amma da sauri ya gane ba zai iya zama haka ba.
Not still alive, not still growing.	Ba har yanzu rayuwa, ba har yanzu girma.
She looked at the door.	Ta kalli kofar.
They will talk closer.	Za su yi magana kusa.
She will not hear.	Ba za ta ji ba.
It has the best hands.	Yana da mafi kyawun hannu.
By far my favorite game.	Ya zuwa yanzu wasan da na fi so.
I still recommend it.	Har yanzu ina ba da shawarar shi.
I knew it would happen as it happened.	Na san zai faru kamar yadda ya faru.
Just a lot of travel.	Kawai tafiya mai yawa.
We understand each other.	Mun fahimci juna.
Not a good sign.	Ba alama mai kyau ba.
But, he knows it's over.	Amma, ya san an gama.
I have to hurry to keep up with it.	Dole ne in yi sauri don ci gaba da ita.
There will be no next child.	Ba za a sami yaro na gaba ba.
Knowing the discomfort of the day.	Sanin rashin jin daɗi na ranar.
Only once a week.	Sau ɗaya a mako kawai.
And of course that's fine.	Kuma tabbas hakan yayi kyau.
I hear them.	Ina jin su.
I can still play.	Har yanzu ina iya wasa.
Three times a week.	Sau uku a mako.
But we can enjoy what we have here and now.	Amma za mu iya jin daɗin abin da muke da shi a nan da kuma yanzu.
She's fine, she's fine, but it won't happen.	Tana da kyau, tana da kyau, amma ba zai faru ba.
Come on in, take a look.	Ku zo kadan.
Work for me.	Aiki a gare ni.
Whenever?	Yaushe ne?
You will not remember me.	Ba za ku tuna da ni ba.
He grew up like you.	Ya girma kamar ku.
At the same time this worked well.	A lokaci guda wannan ya yi aiki da kyau.
Just stand for big.	Kawai tsaya don babban.
I have never seen the man.	Ban taba ganin mutumin ba.
It was an easy day.	Ya kasance rana mai sauƙi.
Something for tomorrow.	Wani abu na gobe.
One of the things that will never go wrong for you.	Daga cikin abubuwan da ba za su taɓa yin kuskure a gare ku ba.
And it all happened because of you.	Kuma duk wannan ya faru ne saboda ku.
Not about me.	Ba game da ni ba.
They apologized for the inconvenience.	Sun ba da hakuri kan rashin jin dadi.
I do not speak.	Ba na magana.
I'm not feeling well.	Ban ji dadi ba.
It seems wrong.	Da alama ba daidai ba ne.
I love this moment in the cold.	Ina son wannan lokacin a cikin sanyi.
This is so.	Wannan haka yake.
Not in the car, not at home, nowhere.	Ba a mota ba, ba a gida ba, babu inda.
You must stay in a cool place.	Dole ne ku zauna a wuri mai sanyi.
I want to be sure.	Ina so in tabbata.
This, you must only see for yourself.	Wannan, dole ne ku gani da kanku kawai.
So it may be.	Don haka yana iya zama.
We thought it was appropriate.	Mun yi tsammanin ya dace.
She doesn't care who she is.	Bata damu da wanene ba.
It's very nice.	Yayi kyau sosai.
Our job is to fix it.	Aikin mu shine mu gyara shi.
Not once, in more than thirty years together.	Ba sau ɗaya ba, a cikin fiye da shekaru talatin tare.
The water kept getting high.	Ruwan ruwa ya yi ta tashi.
It gave me a good idea.	Ya ba ni kyakkyawan tunani.
You are what you eat.	Kai ne abin da kuke ci.
He never touched her.	Bai taba ta ba.
You are there.	Kuna can.
I want to see you again.	Ina so in sake gani.
He does not like much.	Ba ya son da yawa.
We do not have the money to do well.	Ba mu da kuɗin da za mu yi kyau.
That is not fair.	Hakan ba daidai ba ne.
We refuse to do that today.	Mun ƙi yin haka a yau.
I am lying	karya nake
You should pay immediately.	Ya kamata ku biya da sauri.
But your head hurts a lot.	Amma kai yayi zafi sosai.
She heard things much better than other people.	Ta ji abubuwa sosai fiye da sauran mutane.
And now, it will not do.	Kuma yanzu, ba zai yi ba.
Plaintiffs.	Masu kara.
I know you know things.	Na san ka san abubuwa.
But not for me and him.	Amma ba don ni da shi ba.
Join in this celebration!	Shiga cikin wannan bikin!
Now she is well again.	Yanzu ta sake samun lafiya.
Everyone is very nice.	Kowa yana da kyau sosai.
No need to fight.	Babu bukatar fada.
I want to bring you something.	Ina so in kawo muku wani abu.
I'm done thinking now.	Na gama tunani yanzu.
I try not to get involved.	Ina ƙoƙarin kada in shiga ciki.
See you next week !.	Mu hadu mako mai zuwa!.
Just give what we have.	Kawai ku ba da abin da muke da shi.
Otherwise, it will stop.	In ba haka ba, zai tsaya.
He was later arrested.	An kama shi daga baya.
If it is common.	Idan ya kasance na kowa.
We need her too.	Mu ma muna bukatar ta.
It seems to be working on something new.	Da alama yana aiki akan wani sabon abu.
I'd like to go a walk near the water.	Ina so in ɗan yi tafiya kusa da ruwa.
Do not talk to him.	Kada ku yi wata magana da shi.
They lied to us.	Sun yi mana karya.
He did it all for us.	Ya yi mana kyau duka.
This is going to be interesting.	Wannan zai zama mai ban sha'awa.
Now let me think.	Yanzu bari in yi tunani.
It is wrong and writing is writing.	Ba daidai ba ne kuma rubuta shi ne rubuta.
Absolutely.	Sosai.
Now, it's not very good.	Yanzu, ba shi da kyau sosai.
Few do it.	Kadan ne ke yin shi.
I also went.	Ni ma na tafi.
He will finish it once.	Zai gama da ita sau ɗaya.
They do not think like us.	Ba sa tunani kamar mu.
I do not know because no one told me.	Ban sani ba saboda babu wanda ya gaya mani.
After.	Bayan da.
He wanted it.	Ya so shi.
She is the first.	Ita ce ta farko.
Start using them again.	Fara amfani da su kuma.
One right for everyone.	Dama daya ga kowane mutum.
I never really thought of that.	Lallai ban taba tunanin hakan ba.
Maybe we already are.	Wataƙila mun riga mun kasance.
But he did not believe her.	Amma bai yarda da ita ba.
It is almost unbelievable here.	Ba za a iya yarda da kusan nan ba.
I would be happy to do that.	Zan yi farin cikin yin hakan.
He stays in the action.	Yana zama a cikin aikin.
He did it.	Ya yi shi.
To protect you.	Don kare ku.
Above safe.	Sama da lafiya.
She started moving forward.	Ta fara gaba.
I think that's why we are in financial trouble.	Ina ganin shi ya sa muke cikin matsalar kudi.
You hope others agree with you.	Kuna fatan wasu sun yarda da ku.
That name was not taken.	Ba a dauki wannan sunan ba.
You will see what you get.	Za ku ga abin da kuke samu.
I think they are very good.	Ina tsammanin suna da kyau sosai.
They do not know anything about him.	Ba su san komai game da shi ba.
See it.	Duba ni.
He feels for her.	Yana jin ta.
This is done in the following way.	Ana yin hakan ta hanya mai zuwa.
Absolutely.	Babu shakka.
See they do.	Duba suna yi.
So here's what you can do.	Don haka abin da za ku iya yi ke nan.
The police do not know what to do.	'Yan sanda ba su san abin da za su yi ba.
I know something is coming.	Na san wani abu yana zuwa.
I'm afraid to do anything.	Ina tsoron yin wani abu.
Second if you do not want to stop reading them.	Na biyu idan ba ka so ka daina karanta su.
It should be true.	Ya kamata ya zama gaskiya.
I can't think of doing it myself.	Ba zan iya tunanin yin shi da kaina ba.
We all fell in love at the same time.	Mu duka muka fada lokaci guda.
I live a very active life.	Ina rayuwa mai aiki sosai.
That was not difficult.	Hakan bai yi wahala ba.
Sometimes twice a day.	Wani lokaci sau biyu a rana.
This we can know.	Wannan za mu iya sani.
I will be forgotten in time.	Za a manta da ni cikin lokaci.
Tell me otherwise.	Ku gaya mani idan ba haka ba.
I will tell you what will happen.	Zan gaya muku abin da zai faru.
You will continue.	Za ku ci gaba.
I did not think so.	Ban yi tunani ba.
But it is.	Amma haka abin yake.
It is hard for me to read it.	Yana da wuya a gare ni in karanta shi.
She wanted to spend one night in the crowd.	Ta so ta yi dare ɗaya daga cikin taron.
And that is not surprising.	Kuma hakan ba abin mamaki bane.
And that, too, is there.	Kuma wannan ma, yana can.
She did not say so.	Bata yi magana haka ba.
So, please don't talk about it anymore.	Don haka, don Allah kar a ƙara yin magana game da shi haka.
It feels good now.	Yana da kyau ji yanzu.
So there are a lot of things we can never know.	Don haka akwai abubuwa da yawa da ba za mu iya sani ba.
I tried and it works.	Na gwada kuma yana aiki.
He decided that was not the case.	Ya yanke shawarar cewa ba haka ba ne.
They work from home.	Suna aiki daga gida.
The happy hour is now.	Lokacin farin ciki shine yanzu.
Book only.	Littafin kawai.
.	.
Not that it hurts.	Ba cewa jin zafi ba.
It seems to be fast.	Da alama yayi sauri.
Tell me how you got the game.	Faɗa mini yadda kuka sami wasan.
Probably the best coffee you've ever had.	Wataƙila mafi kyawun kofi da kuka taɓa samu.
The sun has risen.	Rana ta fito.
He is not sleeping.	Ba barci yake yi ba.
He does not eat.	Ba ya cin abinci.
We almost lost you once.	Mun kusan rasa ku sau ɗaya.
Just bring them here.	Kawai kawo su nan.
Amazing game.	Wasan ban mamaki.
I can see in the end.	Zan iya gani a ƙarshe.
And it is growing.	Kuma yana girma.
Well.	Shi ke nan.
But everyone seemed to be having a good time.	Amma kowa ya zama kamar yana jin daɗi sosai.
And of course so.	Kuma lallai haka.
Not really since.	Ba sosai ba tun lokacin.
And anyone who says they are lying.	Kuma duk wanda ya ce sun yi karya ne.
Do these amazing things you want to do.	Yi waɗannan abubuwan ban mamaki da kuke so ku yi.
I plan to read one at night.	Ina shirin karanta daya a dare.
Now she doesn't.	Yanzu ba ta da.
The more you gain, the more you lose.	Da yawan ka samu, haka sai ka rasa.
They were all sold out after a week.	Duk an sayar da su bayan mako guda.
I do not know what you are talking about.	Ban san me kuke magana ba.
Let me say that once again.	Bari in sake cewa sau ɗaya.
It happened at that time.	Haka ya faru a wannan lokacin.
But then something amazing happened.	Amma a lokacin ne wani abu mai ban mamaki ya faru.
Is it day or night?	Da rana ne ko dare?
But it is nothing.	Amma ba komai bane.
I like watching people eat.	Ina son kallon mutane suna ci.
This is not the world for us, either.	Wannan ba duniya ba ce a gare mu, kuma.
He wanted to drive, but he could not.	Ya so ya tuƙi, amma ya kasa.
It's weird.	Bakin magana ne.
And this is true.	Kuma wannan gaskiya ne.
You did not take the problem.	Ba ku ɗauki matsalar ba.
I'm glad we decided to go it.	Na yi farin ciki da muka yanke shawarar tafiya shi.
That's the whole point.	Shi ke nan gaba d'aya.
A little pain.	Jin zafi kadan.
I hope they understand.	Ina fatan sun gane.
I think you will do a better job.	Ina tsammanin za ku yi aiki mafi kyau.
We'll see how it goes.	Za mu ga yadda zai kasance.
They will make you drink there.	Za su sanya maka ka sha a wurin.
She is drinking it.	Tana shan shi.
I’m not hard about that kind of thing.	Ba ni da wuya game da irin wannan abu.
Not so.	Ba haka bane.
It's amazing, though.	Yana da ban mamaki, ko da yake.
Do it, don't do it.	Yi haka, ba haka ba.
Watch them do it.	Kallon su yayi.
I'm trying to be like you.	Ina ƙoƙarin zama kamar ku.
She told me they couldn’t take the heat.	Ta gaya min cewa ba za su iya ɗaukar zafi ba.
How do we get there? 	Ta yaya za mu isa can?
I know from the beginning he was not cut off.	Na san tun farko ba a yanke masa hanya ba.
The journey is fast.	Tafiya take cikin sauri.
And it is.	Kuma shi ne.
No, that was not good.	A'a, hakan bai yi kyau ba.
People do it because it’s interesting.	Mutane sun yi saboda yana da ban sha'awa.
People love this.	Mutane suna son wannan.
He does not even know them by name.	Bai ma san su da suna ba.
Tool.	Kayan aiki.
This is a scary thing.	Wannan wani abu ne mai ban tsoro.
He walks in a month.	Yana tafiya cikin wata guda.
You are honest, funny, and honest.	Kai mai gaskiya ne, mai ban dariya, kuma mai gaskiya.
What are the three best things?	Menene abubuwa uku mafi kyau?
That's right.	Haka nawa.
I am sure this is the way of life.	Na tabbata wannan ita ce hanyar rayuwa.
That people want to work now.	Cewa mutane suna son aiki a yanzu.
The place is not suitable.	Wurin bai dace ba.
People play with them, finish them off, and forget about them.	Mutane suna wasa da su, suna gama su, kuma su manta da su.
And that requires time and money.	Kuma wannan yana buƙatar lokaci da kuɗi.
They prefer that.	Sun fi son hakan.
Don't think anyone heard.	Kar ka yi tunanin wani ya ji.
But it can get.	Amma yana iya samun.
They passed the police.	Suka wuce 'yan sanda.
I think it is better to go in the cold.	Na ga zai fi kyau ka tafi cikin sanyi.
I was wrong.	Na yi kuskure.
It looks so good.	Ya yi kyau sosai.
When it came out, it looked really good.	Lokacin da ya fito, ya yi kyau sosai.
I have never had any progress with them.	Ban taba samun ci gaba da su ba.
He gave him a purpose in life.	Ya ba shi dalilin rayuwa.
When finished, you should find something similar to the next one.	Lokacin da aka gama, yakamata ku sami wani abu mai kama da mai zuwa.
This is an unspoken thing.	Wannan abu ne da ba a magana.
I have worked with it before.	Na yi aiki da shi a baya.
I would have reached many people.	Da na isa ga mutane da yawa.
He got up and ran.	Ya tashi da gudu.
No one will ever know you helped me.	Ba wanda zai taɓa sanin ka taimake ni.
In fact, you never spoke.	A gaskiya, ba ka taɓa yin magana ba.
The thoughts you have.	Tunani da kuke yi.
It's necessary.	Ya zama dole.
It looks like the real thing.	Yayi kama da ainihin abin.
He is having lunch.	Yana cin abincin rana.
He lives now.	Yana zaune yanzu.
But they are dead.	Amma sun mutu sosai.
Where there is nothing.	Inda babu komai.
I looked back through the door.	Na kalli baya ta kofar.
It works fine with me.	Yana aiki lafiya tare da ni.
He who hopes will never do it.	Wanda ya yi fatan ba zai taba yi ba.
No one wants, everyone gets.	Ba wanda yake so, kowa ya samu.
We have nothing.	Ba mu da komai.
I talked to him.	Na yi magana da shi.
Life has never been the same after that.	Rayuwa ba ta kasance ɗaya ba bayan wannan.
He really wants something.	Yana son wani abu da gaske.
He just said he didn't want to.	Kawai yace baya so.
The food is good.	Abincin yana da kyau.
This work will not be accepted.	Ba za a yarda da wannan aikin ba.
At first we liked it.	Da farko mun so shi.
At the time it was safe for them.	A lokacin ya zama lafiya a gare su.
He’s not just interested in people, you know.	Ba ya sha'awar mutane kawai, ka sani.
You must stop smoking!	Dole ne ku daina shan taba!
It has to be done.	Dole ne a yi hakan.
I have to leave all this behind me.	Dole ne in bar wannan duka a baya na.
I can't believe she's here.	Ba zan iya yarda tana nan ba.
The train left the station.	Jirgin ya bar tashar.
It just gets hot here.	Kawai sai yayi zafi a nan.
For a while though.	Na ɗan lokaci duk da haka.
To learn more about her.	Don ƙarin sani game da ita.
I think it's good.	Ina tsammanin yana da kyau.
I should be worried.	Ya kamata in damu.
I read this as one.	Na karanta wannan a zama ɗaya.
People started walking.	Mutane sun fara tafiya.
Everything she missed.	Duk abin da ta rasa.
There is no chance to bring it back.	Babu wata dama ta dawo da shi.
The work is not good.	Aikin bai yi kyau ba.
In this way, we provide demand.	Ta wannan hanyar, muna ba da bukata.
They know better.	Sun fi sani.
Who loves driving?	Wanene yake son tuƙi?
It would be nice if someone could help me with it.	Zai yi kyau idan wani zai iya taimaka mini da shi.
I don't know what pleasure is.	Ban san menene jin daɗi ba.
It is amazing and makes it easy.	Tana da ban mamaki kuma ta sa ya zama mai sauƙi.
The plan has not changed.	Shirin bai canza ba.
I agree with you that the problem started from that thought.	Na yarda da ku cewa matsalar ta fara ne daga wannan tunanin.
The most amazing place.	Wuri mafi ban mamaki.
We can tell you about dinner when we get back.	Za mu iya gaya muku kan abincin dare idan mun dawo.
He should die now.	Ya kamata ya mutu a yanzu.
You need to keep working.	Kuna buƙatar ci gaba da aiki.
They are all asleep.	Duk barci suke yi.
What if this and if this.	Menene idan wannan kuma idan wannan.
